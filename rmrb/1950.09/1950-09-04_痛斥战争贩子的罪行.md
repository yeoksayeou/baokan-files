　　Denounce the Crimes of the Warmongers
　　Zhang Jiongbo
    Since American imperialism launched the war in Korea, peace-loving people around the world have unanimously supported the Korean people's struggle against aggression for independence, democracy, and freedom, and have condemned American aggression, demanded an end to armed intervention, the withdrawal of troops invading Korea, and advocated that the Korean issue be resolved by the Koreans themselves.

    Judging from the recent developments, the American warmongers have not learned their lesson and have not pursued a peaceful solution by localizing the Korean War, but instead have intentions to expand the war. Truman first dispatched the Seventh Fleet to invade our territorial waters and prevent us from liberating Taiwan. MacArthur then flew to Taipei to meet with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and issued a statement. Now it is even more blatant. In a telegram to the Chicago Veterans Association, MacArthur brazenly claimed that Taiwan is the linchpin for controlling the Pacific "defense line." U.S. Secretary of the Navy Matthews even publicly clamored for a preemptive war. Truman and Acheson, in the face of all this, had the audacity to shamelessly cover up and deny it, saying that it did not represent the government's opinion. However, the U.S. invading air force in Korea has taken practical action, invading our airspace for two consecutive days, flying to various places on the right bank of the Yalu River, arbitrarily bombing and strafing, killing and wounding dozens of our people.

    From this, it can be seen that the warmongering radicals, such as MacArthur, Johnson, Dulles, and Matthews, have turned from empty threats to practical actions, and are frantically and impatiently attempting to expand the war to cover up their military failures in Korea, offset the internal contradictions of capitalism, and save their declining fate.

    Foreign Minister Zhou has repeatedly protested to the United States and the United Nations, demanding that they stop the aggression. He speaks on behalf of 475 million people, and the whole nation is united as his support.

    In the movement to defend world peace, the number of signatures will soon reach 100 million, indicating our sincere support for world peace. Those warmongers who attempt to undermine world peace are the enemies we resolutely oppose. We have the experience of the eight-year war of resistance, defeating the most stubborn and ferocious Japanese invaders. The American imperialist paper tiger has long been exposed. Atomic bombs, super fortresses, and rocket launchers are just whistling in the graveyard, only good for intimidating the neurasthenic. Against a "small" Korea, using the full force of the army, navy, and air force, the air force has bombed and dropped more than 15,000 tons of bombs, but has not frightened the Korean people, but has instead deepened their hatred for American imperialism. This fact is enough to prove that American imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Most shamelessly, they stole the name of the United Nations, and MacArthur became the commander of the "52-nation Allied Forces," hoping to cover up their aggressive conspiracy. But they are working hard in vain, being beaten by the Korean People's Army until they are routed and retreating steadily.

    They cannot even deal with one Korea. If these warmongers are bent on having their own way, stubbornly clinging to their mistakes, and dare to tempt fate, they will surely receive the punishment they deserve. The fate of the German and Japanese fascists awaits American imperialism. Hitler and Tojo are the fate of the likes of Truman and MacArthur.

　　痛斥战争贩子的罪行
　　张絅伯　
    自从美国帝国主义在朝鲜发动战争，全世界爱好和平人民，一致声援朝鲜人民为独立民主自由而进行的反侵略的斗争，并斥责美帝侵略，要求停止武装干涉，撤退侵朝军队，主张朝鲜问题让朝鲜人自己解决。
    依照近时局势的发展来看，美国战争贩子，没有受到教训，使朝鲜战争局部化，谋取和平解决的途径，而反有扩大战事的企图。杜鲁门首先派遣海军第七舰队，侵入我领海，阻止我解放台湾。麦克阿瑟随后飞台北，与蒋贼见面，发表声明。目前更加露骨，麦魔致芝加哥退伍军人协会的电报中，竟明目张胆地声称台湾是控制太平洋“防线”的总枢纽。美国海军部长马休斯竟公开叫嚣先发制人的战争。以上种种，杜鲁门艾奇逊，居然厚颜无耻，掩饰否认，说并不代表政府的意见。但美国侵朝空军，已实际行动，连续两天，侵犯我国领空，飞至鸭绿江右岸各处，任意投弹扫射，杀伤我国人民，多至数十人。
    由此可知战争贩子急进派，如麦克阿瑟、詹森、杜勒斯、马休斯之流，已由虚声恫吓，转向实际行动，疯狂到了迫不及待的企图扩大战争，来掩饰在朝军事的失败，抵消资本主义内在的矛盾，挽救趋向没落的命运。
    周外长历次向美国及联合国抗议，要求制止侵略。他代表四万七千五百万人民发言，全国万众一心，做他的后盾。
    我们，在保卫世界和平运动中，签名人数，不久将达到一亿，表示我们诚心诚意的拥护世界和平。那些企图破坏世界和平的战争贩子，就是我们坚决反对的敌人。我们有了八年抗战的经验，把最顽强最凶暴的日寇打倒。美国帝国主义纸老虎早已戳穿。原子弹、超空堡垒、火箭炮，不过是坟墓弄里吹唿哨，也只好恐吓神经衰弱的人。对一个“小小的”朝鲜，用尽海陆空三军的力量，空军轰炸投弹，多至一万五千吨以上，并未将朝鲜人民吓倒，反而使他们更对美帝加深他们的仇恨。这一事实就足以证明美帝国主义的外强中干。最无耻的，盗用联合国名义，麦克阿瑟做了“五十二国联军”的统帅，希图掩盖侵略阴谋。但是心劳日拙，被朝鲜人民军打得落花流水，节节败退。
    一个朝鲜，尚且对付不了，如果这批战争贩子，一意孤行，执迷不悟，来太岁头上动土，一定要受到应得的教训。德日法西斯的命运，等待着美帝国主义，希特勒东条便是杜鲁门麦魔之流的下场。
