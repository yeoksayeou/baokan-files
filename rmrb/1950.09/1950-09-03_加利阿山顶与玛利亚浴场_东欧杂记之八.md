　　Mount Galyatető and Mariánské Lázně
    ——Random Notes on Eastern Europe, No. 8
    Feng Zhi
    In order to see more of the important construction in Hungary after liberation, we took a two-day trip to the industrial area in northeastern Hungary. On the morning of April 6th, we set off by car and visited agricultural cooperatives, state-owned farms, and a large power plant built during the Three-Year Plan along the way. In the evening, we arrived at the summit of Mount Galyatető in the Mátra Mountains, the highest point in Hungary, 1,000 meters above sea level.
    At the summit, we entered a hotel, a modern building with simple yet exquisite facilities. It used to be a place for bankers and aristocrats to "rest and recuperate," but it was damaged during the war. Now the government has repaired it and dedicated it to providing vacation recuperation for outstanding workers. The sudden arrival of so many foreigners in the hotel attracted the attention of the original guests. As we sat in the living room waiting for dinner, we were notified that the workers recuperating in the hotel hoped to have an evening party with us.
    It was already past 10 o'clock after dinner. The party began with singing. The first to speak was an educator. He said that he had not enjoyed a formal education under the past reactionary government, but had spent several years in prison. After liberation, he taught political classes in colleges and universities. Because of his good teaching performance, he received a medal and was now recuperating here for a month. Then came textile workers, steelworkers, rural labor heroes... who recounted their past sufferings and present glory, and praised their workplaces as the most beautiful places anywhere. The worker comrades in our delegation also introduced the Chinese workers' struggle stories and their enthusiasm for work after liberation to them. Applause, laughter, shouts of "Long live Rákosi," "Long live Mao Zedong," and "Long live Stalin" never stopped. Twelve o'clock passed, but everyone didn't want to end the party. After the meeting, the educator pulled me aside and asked me about the situation of education in China with infinite concern, and we talked for another twenty minutes, also agreeing to talk again in the morning if we had time.
    We received grand hospitality in Hungary, and on different occasions, we had to observe diplomatic etiquette to some extent. But on this evening, whether it was those who spoke or those who didn't, they were informal, friendly, and amiable, breaking down all boundaries, and everyone felt like they were one family.
    This day was too rich. We saw a lot of things, said a lot of words. Back in my room, I was so excited that I couldn't go to sleep right away. I opened the door leading to the observation deck and walked onto it. The light of the waning crescent moon illuminated the fir trees on the mountain. On this highest peak in Hungary, I thought of Thomas Mann's novel "The Magic Mountain" which I had read before: in a sanatorium in the Swiss mountains—much higher than here, of course—a group of people were gathered who were there to recuperate. They came from different countries, mostly aristocrats, bureaucrats, and freelancers. One passage said that because they had been isolated from actual life for many years, their spirits were no longer normal. They spent their days in dull and decadent pastimes to kill time. Sometimes everyone held a camera and took pictures everywhere, sometimes they collected stamps, sometimes they ate all kinds of chocolate candies, sometimes everyone closed their eyes and competed to draw piglets, sometimes they engaged in Esperanto without any purpose or principles... Every pastime would become a temporary fashion, and every temporary fashion was equally boring. This fully depicts the decadent and degenerate atmosphere in those sanatoriums and recuperation centers in the capitalist world. I thought that Mount Galyatető must have been a "Magic Mountain" before liberation: such fresh air and healthy forests were only healing a group of people who chewed chocolate candies and drew piglets with their eyes closed. Now, the main residents here have become the builders of the new society. They are in the high mountains, but they never forget their factories and their fields. They just want to get healthier so they can go back and work with more strength. —The next morning, the owner of the hotel led us to visit the swimming pool and the kitchen: the water in the swimming pool was permanently clear and permanently maintained at a certain temperature, and everything in the kitchen was as clean as the dining room outside. When we were surprised by all these facilities, the owner said, "Many places in Hungary that used to provide exploiters with a life of debauchery now belong to the people and have become recuperation centers for the working people. Our place is just one of many recuperation centers."
    As in Hungary, many scenic spots in Czechoslovakia have also become recuperation areas for workers. On May 8th, we arrived at Mariánské Lázně and Karlovy Vary in western Czech Republic, near the German border. These two bath towns have always been called the two pearls in the Bohemian Valley, because the spring water containing various minerals can treat many diseases, and they have been famous for centuries. Especially in the first half of the nineteenth century, the Austrian empress and some German-speaking princes gathered in this area continuously, almost becoming the political center. In 1819, Metternich, the leader of European reaction, convened a meeting of the prime ministers of the German and Austrian states in Karlovy Vary and passed a series of reactionary decisions to supervise university activities and censor magazines and books. At the same time, Goethe often came here in those years. No matter how much the spirit of resistance was expressed in his early works, and how many premonitions of the new era to come were in his later writings, whenever he met princes and nobles walking towards him in these places, he regarded himself as their servant, took off his hat, and stood aside bowing. This posture once caused many people to ridicule him.
    Now these scenic spots, occupied by the German and Austrian nobles for hundreds of years, have returned to the hands of the Czech people. When we arrived at Mariánské Lázně, there were not many tourists, because the recuperation season had not yet begun. But everywhere was being renovated and tidied up. The hotels, drinking halls, bathhouses, sports grounds, swimming pools, and those tree-lined gardens were all going to be repaired neatly, ready to welcome the workers who will come here this year for recuperation.
    "When does the recuperation season begin?" we asked the person in charge of the bath management office, who was accompanying us on the tour.
    "It starts on May 15th," he replied. "By then, trade unions from all over the country will send workers who need to recuperate here. There are forty workers' sanatoriums here for them to live in."
    "How long can a person stay? Does every worker get a chance to recuperate?"
    "A person can stay for two weeks. There are more than one million Czech trade union members, and there are 250 sanatoriums across the country, which can accommodate 250,000 people a year. So currently, only outstanding model workers can get the chance to recuperate. In the future, as sanatoriums gradually increase, the opportunities will also gradually increase."
    During lunch, the host continued to tell us: "Czechoslovakia has no sea, but it has world-famous mineral springs. We exchange our mineral springs for their sea with our friendly countries. Every year, many workers from Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria come to Czechoslovakia for recuperation, and we also send some of our workers to the coasts of Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. In this way, our workers can also breathe the air by the sea and swim in the sea. Last year alone, 5,000 workers got the opportunity to go abroad. And sometimes we also invite worker comrades from capitalist countries to come here: last year, when French workers went on strike, Czech workers raised a lot of money for French workers to support their strike struggle, but this donation could not be sent out due to the obstruction of the French government. So, we brought our French comrades-in-arms to Mariánské Lázně to recuperate, using this money to entertain them and strengthen the solidarity of international workers."
    After listening to this report, and thinking about what those princes and nobles who gathered here in the previous century had done! They were either fighting each other for personal gain, or jointly discussing how to suppress the people, and the remaining time was spent on boring pastimes and male and female flirting. Now that this place belongs to the working people, it immediately shows the friendship and solidarity of international workers.
    At lunch, children welcomed us with flowers, young people welcomed us with Czech folk songs, workers repairing the bath stretched out their strong and warm hands to welcome us, and the female cooks also came out of the kitchen, saying that they would make the dishes especially delicious to welcome us. In the continuous welcome, this meal lasted for two hours. When we got up to leave Mariánské Lázně, it was already 3:30 in the afternoon.
    The journey from Mariánské Lázně to Karlovy Vary is an endlessly changing journey. The car sometimes runs in forest valleys and sometimes on hillsides, with endless twists and turns and endless beautiful scenery. Because it was late, we couldn't stay in Karlovy Vary. We could only drive the car slowly and pass by it. From the outside, it seemed that its scale was even grander than Mariánské Lázně.

　　加利阿山顶与玛利亚浴场
    ——东欧杂记之八
    冯至
    为了多看一些匈牙利解放后重要的建设，我们到匈牙利东北部的工业区作了两天的旅行。四月六日早晨，乘汽车出发，在路上参观了农业合作社，国营农场，三年计划中建设起来的大发电厂。晚间到了马特拉山区中的加利阿山顶，这是全匈牙利最高的地方，高出海面一千公尺。
    我们在山顶上走进一家旅馆，旅馆是一座现代式的建筑，设备简要而精致。它过去是银行家和贵族们“休息养病”的处所，战争时遭受了破坏，如今政府把它重新修复，专供优秀的工人在里边作假期的休养。旅馆里忽然来了这么多的外国人，引起原住客人的注意。当我们刚在客厅里坐下等候晚饭时，我们就得到通知，这旅馆里从事休养的工人希望和我们共同开一个晚会。
    晚饭后已经十点多钟了，晚会以唱歌开始，最初发言的是一个教育工作者。他说，他在过去反动政府的统治下没有享受过正规的教育，却住了几年的监牢，解放后在高等学校里教政治课，因为教课成绩好，得到奖章，现在在这里作一个月的休养。随后有纺织工人，炼钢工人，农村里的劳动英雄……起来述说他们过去的苦难与现在的光荣，并且把他们工作的场所夸奖比什么地方都美。我们代表团里的工人同志也把中国工人一些斗争的事迹和解放后工作的热情介绍给他们。掌声，欢笑声，拉科西万岁，毛泽东万岁和斯大林万岁的呼声，始终没有停息过。十二点钟过去了，大家也不想散会。会散了，那位教育工作者把我拉在一边，以无限的关怀问我中国教育的情形，又谈了二十分钟，还约定明天早晨有功夫再谈。
    我们在匈牙利受人隆重的招待，在不同的场合都或多或少要遵守外交上的礼节。但是这天晚上，不管是发言的，或是没有发言的，却都不拘形式，亲切友爱，破除了一切界限，彼此觉得像是一家人一般。
    这一天的生活太丰富了，看了不少的东西，说了不少的话，回到寝室里，兴奋得不能立刻去睡，我把通往望台的门打开，走到望台上。下弦月的月光照映着满山的枞林，在这匈牙利最高的山顶上我想起来从前读过的托马斯·曼的长篇小说《魔山》：在瑞士高山上的——比这里当然高得多——一家疗养院里，聚集着一些养病的人，他们来自不同的国家，多半是些贵族，官僚，自由职业者。里边有一段说他们由于长年与实际的生活隔离，精神都失却正常，终日作些愚钝而颓废的消遣来消磨岁月。有时人人捧着一个照像机到处摄影，有时搜集邮票，有时吃各种各样的巧克力糖，有时大家闭着眼睛比赛画小猪，有时既无目的又无原则地搞世界语……每一种消遣都会成为一时的风尚，每个一时的风尚都是同样地无聊。这里充分地描写出资本主义世界那些休养所和疗养院里颓废而堕落的气氛。我想，加利阿山顶在解放前一定也是一座“魔山”：这样清新的空气和健康的树林，不过只是疗养着一群口嚼巧克力糖，闭着眼睛画小猪的人们。如今，这里的主要住客变成新社会的建筑者了，他们在高山上，却时时刻刻忘不了他们的工厂，他们的田地。他们只是想把身体养得更健康，好回去用更多的力量去工作。——第二天早晨，旅馆里的主人引导着我们参观了游泳池和厨房：游泳池里的水永久澄清，而且永久保持着一定的温度，厨房里的一切和外边的饭厅是同样清洁。当我们惊讶这一切的设备时，主人说，“匈牙利过去许多供剥削者过着淫靡生活的地方，如今都归属人民了，成为劳动人民的休养所。我们这里不过是许多休养所中的一个。”
    与匈牙利同样情形，捷克斯洛伐克的许多名胜地方也都成为劳动者的休养区了。五月八日，我们到了捷克西陲，靠近德国边境的玛利亚浴场和卡尔浴场。这两座浴场一向被称为波希米亚山谷里的两颗珍珠，因为含有各种不同矿质的泉水能治疗许多病症，从中世纪以来它们就远近闻名。尤其在十九世纪前半，奥国的皇后和一些说德国话的大大小小的公侯们不断地到这一带地方聚会，几乎变成政治的中心。一八一九年，欧洲反动的首领梅特涅在卡尔浴场召集过德奥各邦的首相会议，通过了监督大学生活动，审查杂志书籍种种反动的决定。同时在那些年内，歌德也常到这里来。不管他早年的作品表现了多少反抗的精神，晚年的著作里有多少对于未来的新时代的预感，但是他在这些地方每逢遇见王公贵族们迎面走来，他便把自己看成他们的臣仆，脱下帽子，弯着身站在一边。这姿态曾经引起不少人对他的嘲笑。
    如今这些被德奥贵族们霸占了几百年的胜地又回到捷克人民的手里了。我们到达玛利亚浴场时，游人并不多，因为休养的季节还没有开始。可是到处在刷新整理，旅馆，饮水厅，沐浴室，运动场，游泳池，以及那些树木茂盛的园林，都将要修理得整整齐齐，准备着迎接今年到这里来休养的工人。
    “休养的季节什么时候开始呢？”我们问陪着我们到处参观的，浴场管理处的负责人。
    “五月十五日开始，”他回答，“到那时，各地的工会就会把需要到这里来休养的工人们送到这里来。这里有四十处工人休养所供他们居住。”
    “一个人能住多久呢？是不是每个工人都能得到休养的机会呢？”
    “一个人能住两星期。捷克工会会员有一百多万，全国有二百五十个休养所，全年能容留二十五万人，所以目前只有工作优良的模范工人能得到休养的机会。将来休养所渐渐增加，机会也会渐渐增加的。”
    吃午饭的时候，主人继续向我们述说：“捷克斯洛伐克没有海，但是有世界闻名的矿泉。我们就向我们的友邦用我们的矿泉换他们的海。每年从波兰，从罗马尼亚和保加利亚都有不少的工人到捷克斯洛伐克来休养，我们也把我们一部分的工人送到波兰，罗马尼亚和保加利亚的海滨。这样，我们的工人也可以呼吸海边的空气，在海水里游泳了。去年一年，就有五千工人得到机会到外国去。并且有时我们也邀请资本主义国家的工人同志们到我们这里来：去年法国工人罢工时，捷克工人给法国工人募了许多款，支援他们罢工的斗争，但是这项捐款由于法国政府的阻挠寄不出去，于是我们把法国的战友们接到玛利亚浴场来休养，用这笔钱招待他们，加强国际工人的团结。”
    我听了这段报告，再想一想前世纪在这里聚集过的那些王公贵族，他们都作了些什么事！不是彼此为了个人的利益钩心斗角，就是共同商议着怎样压制人民，剩下的时间就是无聊的消遣和男女的调情。如今这里属于劳动人民了，便立即表现出国际工人的友谊和团结。
    在午饭时，儿童们用鲜花来欢迎我们，青年们用捷克的民歌来欢迎我们，修理浴场的工人伸出他们粗壮而热情的手来欢迎我们，女厨工也从厨房里走出，她们说，她们要把菜做得格外可口，来欢迎我们。在接连不断的欢迎中，这顿饭延续了两个钟头。等到起身离开玛利亚浴场时，已经下午三点半了。
    从玛利亚浴场到卡尔浴场是一段变化无穷的路程，汽车时而走在林谷里，时而走到山坡上，绕不完的曲折，看不完的美景。因为时间晚了，我们不能在卡尔浴场停留，只有把汽车开慢一点，在它旁边走过，从外表看，觉得它一切的规模比玛利亚浴场还要宏大些。
