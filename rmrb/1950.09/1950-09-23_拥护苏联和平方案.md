　　Support the Soviet Peace Plan
    At the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on the afternoon of the 20th, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, delivered a speech and put forward a declaration to stop the threat of a new war and consolidate world peace and security. This speech and declaration pointed out the only path to peace to the people of the world. However, the speech by the American imperialist warmonger Acheson at the General Assembly made it clearer to the people of the world that the American warmongers are trying to sacrifice the Security Council to undermine the principle of great power unanimity in the Security Council, use the United Nations as a cover for the United States to expand its aggression, suppress the struggles of national people for self-liberation, and realize its dream of dominating the world. This is a bloody road to war.
    The Soviet peace plan represents the common aspirations of peace-loving people all over the world, is completely in line with the goals of the World Peace Congress to oppose new wars of aggression and ban atomic weapons, and further enriches the Stockholm Declaration. The people of all countries who have suffered from the disasters of the two world wars, including the American people, know clearly that a new war will cause serious destruction to the lives and property of the people of all countries; they do not want war, they demand peace. Striving to realize the Soviet peace plan is the only way to consolidate world human peace and security.
    However, at present, the people of the world must be highly vigilant against the war threat created by the American aggressors. The United States is not only carrying out barbaric aggression against Korea, frantically bombing and suppressing the Korean people; but also increasingly intensifying its armed aggression, seriously threatening and undermining world peace and security. Such barbaric acts of aggression by the United States will undoubtedly arouse more widespread and stronger resistance from the people of the invaded countries in today's world where people are increasingly awakening, and make American imperialism itself more isolated and helpless, and accelerate its own demise. The United States attempts to dominate the world by force, but historical facts have long proven that this is a dead end, the old path of failure taken by Hitler. Hitler also dreamed of ruling the world by force, but was ultimately defeated by the power of the people of the world; today the United States is in a more unfavorable position than Hitler in many fundamental aspects, and the power of the people far exceeds that when Hitler was defeated. But we must pay attention to the fact that the American aggressors are now manipulating the United Nations. The organization of the United Nations was originally an important tool for maintaining peace and international security, but because many countries today are willing to be puppets of the American aggressors, they have not only failed to fulfill their responsibilities of maintaining world peace and international security, but have also supported the aggressive actions of the American warmongers. The United Nations is increasingly becoming a tool for American aggressors, and therefore, the United Nations is very likely not to pass the Soviet Union's just proposal, which is enthusiastically supported by the majority of mankind in the world.
    It must be pointed out that the United Nations General Assembly made an extremely absurd and unreasonable resolution immediately after its opening, and that is the resolution on the issue of Chinese representation. The proposals put forward successively by the representatives of India and the Soviet Union to invite the delegation of the People's Republic of China to attend the General Assembly were rejected by the majority who listened to the United States. The Central People's Government of our country is the only legal government of our country today, the only government that effectively exercises its functions and powers within China. The United Nations' unreasonable refusal of our country's representatives to participate in the General Assembly is completely illegal. It is a great shame for the United Nations that the representatives of the Kuomintang remnants who have long been spurned by the Chinese people are still in the United Nations! The Chinese people know very well that the long delay in resolving the issue of Chinese representation is due to the deliberate obstruction by the United States, and it is also a despicable means for the United States to undermine peace and security in the Far East. As Indian Prime Minister Nehru said: "Although the United Nations resolution rejected India's proposal, it did not take into account the real situation in China today. If the United Nations is still dreaming of the old China that is now almost dead, then it is closing its eyes to the facts." However, even if the US government forces the majority of the United Nations to close their eyes, the facts are still facts. This can never harm the glory of our great People's Republic of China, but can only prove what a group of shameless and black-and-white American representatives and their lackeys are sitting in the United Nations General Assembly!
    Under the circumstances that the United States manipulates the majority of the United Nations, the Soviet Union's proposed plan for establishing lasting peace, even if it may continue to suffer all kinds of obstruction and sabotage from the US imperialist group, the justice of mankind cannot be overwhelmed by a small group of imperialist executioners after all. The will of the majority of mankind to pursue peace has become a great material force, and this just plan of the Soviet Union will surely penetrate the hearts of the world and become a powerful weapon for peace-loving mankind. People of the world! Advance bravely and resolutely, overthrow the aggressors! Justice is on our side, and we will surely win!

### 拥护苏联和平方案

　　拥护苏联和平方案
    在联合国大会二十日下午举行的全体会议上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发表演说，提出了制止新战争威胁，巩固世界和平与安全的宣言。这个演说和宣言，在全世界人民面前指出了和平的唯一道路。而美国帝国主义战争贩子艾奇逊在大会上的发言，却使世界人民更清楚地看到，美国的战争贩子们正在企图牺牲安全理事会，借以破坏安理会中的大国一致的原则，利用联合国作为掩护美国扩大侵略的工具，镇压自求解放的国家人民的斗争，实现其独霸世界的梦想。这是一条血腥的战争的道路。
    苏联和平方案代表着世界爱好和平人民的共同愿望，是与保卫世界和平大会反对新侵略战争，禁止原子武器的奋斗目标完全相符合的，并且进一步充实了斯德哥尔摩宣言。饱经两次世界大战灾难的各国人民，包括美国人民在内，他们清醒地知道，新的战争将使各国人民的生命财产受到严重的毁灭；他们不要战争，他们要求和平。争取实现苏联和平方案，乃是巩固世界人类和平与安全的唯一途径。
    但是，目前全世界人民，对于美国侵略者所造成的战争威胁，必须提起高度的警惕。美国不但正在对朝鲜进行野蛮的侵略，疯狂地轰炸与镇压朝鲜人民；而且还日益加紧扩大它的武装侵略行动，严重地威胁与破坏着世界的和平与安全。美国这种野蛮的侵略行动，在世界人民日益觉醒的今天，无疑地要激起被侵略各国人民更加普遍和更加强烈的反抗，而使美帝国主义自己更加陷入孤立无援的绝境，而加速它自己的死亡。美国企图用武力称霸世界，但，历史的事实早已证明这是走不通的，这是希特勒所走过的失败老路。希特勒也曾梦想用武力统治世界，但是终被世界人民的力量击败了；今天美国在许多基本方面都处于比希特勒更不利的地位，而人民的力量却远远超过打败希特勒的时候。但是我们必须注意的是美国侵略者今天操纵着联合国。联合国的组织，本来是维持和平和国际安全的重要的工具，但是由于在今天有许多国家，甘心作美国侵略者的傀儡，他们不但未能尽维持世界和平和国际安全的职责，反而支持着美国战争贩子们的侵略行动。联合国正在日益成为美国侵略者的御用机关，因此，联合国很可能通不过为全世界大多数人类所热烈拥护的苏联的正义提案。
    必须指出：这次联合国大会开幕后立即作出了一个极端荒谬无理的决议，这就是关于中国代表权问题的决议。印度和苏联两国代表先后提出的邀请我中华人民共和国代表团出席大会的建议，竟遭到听命于美国的多数所否决。我国中央人民政府是今天我国唯一合法的政府，唯一在中国境内有效行使职权的政府，联合国无理地拒绝我国代表参加大会，是完全非法的。为中国人民所早已唾弃的国民党残余匪帮的代表仍然留在联合国，这实在是联合国的绝大耻辱！中国人民深知，中国代表权问题的迟迟不能解决，乃是美国从中蓄意阻挠，也是美国破坏远东和平安全一种卑鄙手段。正如印度总理尼赫鲁所说的：“联合国决议案虽然拒绝了印度的建议，但没有顾到目前中国的真实情况。如果联合国仍在梦想着现在差不多已经死亡了的旧中国，那它就是闭起眼睛不看事实。”但是，美国政府纵然强迫联合国的多数闭起眼睛，事实仍然是事实。这决不能损害我伟大中华人民共和国的光荣，而只能证明坐在联合国大会会场上的美国代表及其走狗们是一群怎样寡廉鲜耻、颠倒黑白的东西！
    在美国操纵着联合国大多数的情况下，苏联提出的建立持久和平的方案，即使可能继续遭受美帝国主义集团的百般阻挠与破坏，但人类的正义究竟不是一小群帝国主义刽子手所能压倒的。大多数人类追求和平的意志已经成为伟大的物质的力量，而苏联的这一正义的方案，必将深入世界人心，成为爱好和平的人类的有力武器。全世界的人民！勇敢地坚决地前进，打倒侵略者！正义是在我们方面，我们必然胜利！
