Visiting Ilya Ehrenburg
    ——Third Moscow Visit
    Liu Baiyu
    Moscow in June is like late spring in China. On the afternoon of the 26th, after the rain cleared, the golden light on the top of the Kremlin tower was shining happily. We came out of the "Natsional" (the hotel where we were staying), walked along the shady trees of Gorky Street, and arrived at the famous Soviet Square. The red building of the Moscow City Soviet stands on the front of the square. Looking to the left from there, there is a white seven-story building. Above the main entrance of this building, I saw a golden relief portrait. This is a memorial to the great Russian writer Shishkov, who used to live here. And now the great Soviet writer Ehrenburg lives here, whom we are going to visit.
    As I rode the elevator to the seventh floor, I wondered: What kind of person will I meet? How do people around the world see him?
    The name Ilya Ehrenburg is already a household name around the world. When people talk about Ehrenburg, they are not so much talking about a writer as they are talking about their own happiness, about human peace. Long ago, when fascist black bombs were raging over the heads of the Spanish people, Ehrenburg was on the Madrid front line. His works are full of the blood and tears of struggle. He accused evil and called for revenge. Later, he witnessed the historical tragedy of the fall of Paris with his own eyes, and he came to the front line of the Soviet motherland, fighting for the people of the whole world. His heart was filled with the bitterness and resentment of the entire European people, and his every word was like a sharp sword pointing at the enemy. In Moscow, someone told me that during 1941-1942, when Hitler was frantically approaching Moscow, he announced that after occupying Moscow, he would hang six people, one of whom was Ehrenburg. But in those long, long years of war, Ehrenburg kept ringing the bell of victory. His articles were like the sound of the Red Army's advancing footsteps, shaking the world, from Moscow to Berlin. Of course, I cannot forget his earliest novels introduced to China: "Kommunalka's Smoking Pipe" and the recent Stalin Prize-winning novels "The Fall of Paris" and "The Storm." Today, when American imperialism threatens the people of the world with a new war, we hear Ehrenburg's louder voice: "As a writer, I want to talk about literature, about the charm of literature, about poets and writers. But I want to talk about another thing: about the threat that hangs over the world like a dark cloud. I want to talk about this because the new barbarians are threatening everything I cherish: they threaten the yellowed ancient books in European libraries and the children who have just opened picture books to learn to read, Pushkin and Ronsard, the Louvre and the Uffizi, the trees loved by poets, the poets themselves, gardens, and all the cities of our glorious ancient culture." (Note) This is the voice of the people of the world spoken in the language of a poet.
    After ringing the doorbell, we were led into the living room. Ehrenburg came.
    He – is an old man, with a full head of gray hair, wearing a beige suit. His eyes deeply look at the world.
    After sitting down, we greeted him and talked about the publication of his works in China. He told us that he was very happy, and that he already had Chinese versions of his books. He led us through the corridor and into his study. The study is not large, located next to the living room, but in the opposite direction. The window of the living room faces the bustling Gorky Street in the center of Moscow. The study faces the back of the building, so it is very quiet here, and the windows offer a view of the ocean-like rooftops and blue sky. A large desk is placed horizontally between the two windows, covered with books, manuscripts, and various small flower pots, pottery, and ancient art pieces. Vines climbed all over the window – these vines do not grow outside, but grow from a magnetic pot inside. At this time, I suddenly remembered a photo of him that I had seen a long time ago. One can imagine how he smoked his pipe when he was deep in thought. He led us to stand in front of the bookshelf opposite the desk, which was as high as the wall. He pointed out various Chinese translations to us. The most prominent of these was the complete translation of "The Fall of Paris" by Xu Chi and Yuan Shuipai. At the same time, I also saw the collection of political essays "June on the Don" translated by Ge Baoquan. Turning over the yellowed draft paper, I was reminded of the difficult publishing conditions during the War of Resistance. It turned out that this entire shelf of books was Ehrenburg's own works. There are translations in various countries, from Japan in the East to England in the West. It is said that "The Fall of Paris" had translations in fifteen countries not long after its publication. And "The Storm"? There is a column on the shelf entirely dedicated to "The Storm," but unfortunately, I have not yet seen a Chinese translation here. At this time, I felt that I was not standing in front of a bookshelf, but in front of a vast ocean, in front of the world, in front of a great era.
    Turning around, I noticed a pencil sketch of Ehrenburg on the wall.
    I know Ehrenburg's friendship with Picasso, and I remember that the white dove painted by Picasso for the World Peace Movement has flown all over the world, and I really wanted to find Picasso's handwriting. Sure enough, Ehrenburg noticed my attention and said:
    "Picasso!" He added: "Isn't it very similar to Chinese painting? That's also Picasso!"
    That was a colored landscape painting on the side wall of the desk, and next to it were several landscape paintings by famous Soviet painters.
    Ehrenburg, under this wall, in front of this window, on this huge desk, constantly emits a strong brilliance to the world.
    We returned to the living room. The afternoon sun was shining brightly in the room – potted flowers and plants, beautiful oriental-style wall carpets, and various art pieces created a romantic atmosphere in the room. Mrs. Ehrenburg, wearing a long black dress, also came to greet the guests from afar. Food was laid out on that long table, but we sat down around a small round table by the window. I remember that ten days ago, at the "Literary Gazette" office, Simonov asked us: "Ehrenburg also wants to see you!" Now he and his wife asked us questions about the Chinese language and Chinese poetry. He said that he had read the French translation of Chairman Mao's poems. From the influence of poetry, he also asked about current Chinese literary works. We also asked him about the creation of his novel "The Storm."
    He talked about the characters described in "The Storm."
    He said that all the characters in it were people he had seen in life. However, he wrote not only about the people he saw, but also created characters by concentrating the advantages and disadvantages of the people he saw.
    Ehrenburg's words are concise and profound:
    "Don't reflect a person as if taking a photo. That's not a writer. That can be done in a photo studio. What a writer needs is a typical character." On this issue, he also said: "'The Storm' does not have a single unique protagonist. It writes about the intellectuals of France, Germany, and the Soviet Union during the war. Some of the characters in it are just more important, and some are less important. 'The Fall of Paris' is also like this. The hero written by a writer is based not on one person but on many people – what is seen outside, plus the writer's own created thoughts and qualities."
    The conversation led to the collection of materials. He said: "Collecting materials is just for setting the scene. That's a third or fourth-rate thing, not a first-rate thing, that's not for the theme. The content, the thoughts of the characters, are all embodied in real life. What the writer describes is not the facts seen in the past, but what he creates according to those situations."
    Regarding life, he believes: "The author should not look at life from a spectator's position, but should participate in life himself." He said: "Otherwise, the reader cannot be moved."
    We asked: "In the creative process, do the characters not completely follow what was originally conceived, but change?"
    "When I first started writing, I wasn't completely sure how the hero would act. Only in the creative process did the state of the characters gradually become clear. If it's not handled properly, contradictions will naturally arise."
    "Is there a lot of revision during the writing process?"
    "If I feel that a chapter is not good, I rewrite it. If it's written well, I write it down and don't revise it anymore."
    At this time, the phone rang again from the corridor. This was the second time. He answered the phone and came back, humorously saying: "The invention of the telephone is very bad, it makes you answer the phone all day long." This made everyone laugh.
    Our conversation turned to the theme of the work, and he replied very positively:
    "I never think about writing that topic first, and then go to collect materials. The theme is embodied in life.
    "For example, when writing 'The Storm,' that was not my imagination. Because there was a war in reality, the theme of this book is war. As for the stories and plots in the book, that is not only what I saw, but also what I created." Here, Ehrenburg pointed out very valuable creative experience, he said: "For example, now I plan to write the second part of 'The Storm,' I need to know the current life of the French people. Many people have told me stories about this, but I don't write these ready-made stories, what I want to write is still what I create myself. I didn't participate in the Battle of Stalingrad, but why can I write about the Battle of Stalingrad? On the one hand, it is listening to what others have said, and on the other hand, it is mainly because I have experienced war life on other battlefields. In this way, even if I didn't go, I can still write. Tolstoy wrote 'War and Peace,' he may not have participated in the war at that time, but he did participate in the Crimean War." He emphatically restated his opinion: "For writers, the main thing is not to collect materials, but to participate in life."
    "A great danger is that a person becomes a professional writer at the age of twenty." I understand that he means being detached from real life. "Chekhov was a doctor, he met all kinds of people, Gorky was also like this. It is very dangerous for a writer to start at the age of twenty, it is impossible to become a good writer, because he does not know life." He added with a very humorous smile: "The earlier you learn to dance, the better, the later you become a writer, the better."
    I asked him if he had started writing the second part of "The Storm"?
    He said not yet. He said he is currently writing articles about Belgium and Sweden.
    Yes, I remember that when I first arrived in Moscow, others told me: Ehrenburg is not in Moscow. He had just returned from Belgium and Sweden two weeks ago. Speaking of this trip abroad, Mrs. Ehrenburg told us a very meaningful thing. It turned out that this time he went to understand the current life of the French people in order to write the second part of "The Storm." But the French government was afraid of him and did not allow him to enter Paris. Although when France was in danger, when the French people resisted the German struggle, Ehrenburg had won the honorary title of officer of the French Guard for his contribution to the struggle, and it was signed and issued by De Gaulle at that time, but now, the French government does not allow him to enter Paris. After the efforts of the Soviet Embassy to negotiate, they wanted to strive for him to be able to stop in Paris for forty-eight hours. The Paris Police Department put forward the condition: as long as he does not write articles. But they immediately overturned this idea. In this way, Ehrenburg did not stay long at the airport, got off this plane, and was put on that plane. So, Ehrenburg went to Sweden and Belgium near France. However, the French reactionary authorities could not build a wall between the French people and Ehrenburg. French patriots came to Belgium and Sweden through that ban. They told Ehrenburg all about their current life and struggle. This event shows how Ehrenburg – the reactionary rulers fear him and hate him, but how the people who fight for peace welcome him and love him.
    The setting sun dyed the window glass golden and brilliant.
    The visit lasted nearly two hours. When we said goodbye, he gave us his new book "The Voice of the Writer" published in the "Mars" series as a souvenir. Let us remember – what a good and profound topic this is. Let us remember – Ehrenburg's deep, firm eyes watching the world and his steps walking in the front line of defending peace. When I returned to Beijing from Moscow, when I was writing this visit report, Ehrenburg was no longer in his residence on Gorky Street in Moscow, but appeared again in Prague, at the meeting of the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. When an Associated Press reporter raised provocative questions, Ehrenburg replied: "There are no Korean soldiers or Chinese soldiers in the United States, but American troops are slaughtering people in Korea. Who is the aggressor, the truth is very clear." Yes, this is the voice of a true writer, the voice of battle.
    [Note] This is the opening section of Ehrenburg's speech at the Paris Peace Conference. Ronsard was a great French poet of the Renaissance. The Louvre and the Uffizi are famous art galleries, the former in Paris and the latter in Florence, Italy.

　　访问伊里亚·爱伦堡
    ——莫斯科访问记之三
    刘白羽
    六月的莫斯科，有如中国的春末。二十六日下午，雨后放晴，克里姆林宫塔顶上闪着幸福的金光。我们由“纳采纳尔”（我们住的饭店）出来，沿着高尔基大街的树荫，走到有名的苏维埃广场。莫斯科市苏维埃那座红色建筑耸立在广场正面。从它那里向左侧望，是一幢白色的七层大楼。在这楼房正门上面，我看见一个金色浮雕人像。这是一种纪念，纪念从前在这里面居住过的俄罗斯大作家西施可夫。而现在这里面住着我们将要访问的苏联大作家爱伦堡。
    当我乘电梯升向第七层楼的一瞬间，我想到：我将会见的是怎样一个人？世界上的人们是怎样看着他？
    伊里亚·爱伦堡的名字，已经是世界妇孺皆知的名字。人们谈到爱伦堡，与其说是在讲一个作家，无宁说是在讲自己的幸福，在讲人类的和平。很久以前，当法西斯黑色炸弹在西班牙人民头上狂炸的时候，爱伦堡在玛德里防线上。他的作品充满斗争的血与泪。他控诉罪恶，号召复仇。后来他亲眼看见巴黎沦陷的历史悲剧，他来到为全世界人民而战的苏维埃祖国前线。他的心充溢着整个欧洲人民的辛酸与愤恨，他的每一句话有如利剑指向敌人。在莫斯科有人告诉我，据说一九四一——四二年，希特勒疯狂迫近莫斯科，曾经宣布，占领莫斯科后，要绞死六个人，其中之一就是爱伦堡。但在那漫长漫长的战争年代，爱伦堡却把胜利的钟声不断敲响。他的文章，就有如红军前进的脚步声，震动世界，从莫斯科走向柏林。当然，我也不能忘记他最早介绍入中国的小说：《康穆纳尔的烟袋》以及近年连获斯大林奖金的长篇小说《巴黎的陷落》和《暴风雨》。今天，当美帝国主义用新的战争来威胁世界人民时，我们听见爱伦堡更高的声音：“作为一位作家，我希望谈文学，谈文学的魅力，谈诗人和文人。但我要谈另一件事：谈那像乌云一样高悬在世界头上的威胁。我要讲这个，是因为新的野蛮人威胁着我所珍爱的一切：他们威胁欧洲图书馆中发黄的古书和刚刚翻开看图识字的孩子、普希金和龙沙尔、鲁佛和伍菲齐、诗人喜爱的树木、诗人自己、花园，还有所有我们光荣的古文化的城市。”（注）这是以诗人的语言说出全世界人民的心意。
    按了门铃后，我们被引进客厅。爱伦堡来了。
    他——是一个老人了，满头参色头发，穿着一套米黄色衣服。他的眼睛深沉地看着世界。
    坐下来之后，我们向他致意，并且说到他的著作在中国出版的情况。他对我们说——他很高兴，而且他已经有了中文版本的书籍。他引我们穿过走廊，走进他的书房。书房不大，与客厅并列，但方向相反。客厅的窗下正是莫斯科市中心繁华的高尔基大街。书房则朝着楼背后，因此这里十分幽静，窗外展开海洋一样的屋顶和蓝色天空。两窗之间横置着一张巨大书桌，桌上摆满书籍、原稿和各种小巧的花盆、陶磁及古艺术品。窗上爬满藤蔓，——这藤蔓不长在外边，而是从里面一个磁盆中生长起来的。椅后墙上挂着一排十三个烟斗，同时还有各色各样的烟斗散在书房各处。这时，我蓦然记起我很久以前看见过他的一帧照像。可以想见，当他在深沉的思索时是怎样吸着烟斗。他引我们走到桌对面书架前站着，这是和墙壁一样高的书架。他从中指点各种中文译本给我们看。其中最显著的是徐迟、袁水拍合译的《巴黎的陷落》的全译本。同时我也看见戈宝权译的《六月在顿河》等政论集。翻着发黄了的草纸，让我回想到抗战时期艰难的出版条件。原来这满满一架书都是爱伦堡自己的作品。这里有世界各国的译本，东方的日本以至西方的英国。据说《巴黎的陷落》出版不久就有了十五国译本，《暴风雨》呢？架上有一栏完全是《暴风雨》，可惜这里还未看见中文译本。这时，我觉得我不是站在书架前，而是站在浩瀚的大海面前，而是站在世界面前，而是站在伟大时代面前了。
    转过身，我注意到墙壁上一幅爱伦堡的铅笔速写像。
    我知道爱伦堡与毕加索的友谊，我记得毕加索为保卫世界和平运动而绘的白鸽，已经飞遍全世界，我很想寻找出毕加索的笔迹。果然，爱伦堡发现了我的注意力，他说：
    “毕加索！”还补充了一句：“这不很像中国画吗？那也是毕加索！”
    那是书桌侧面墙壁上一幅彩色风景画，和它并列还有苏联名画家的几幅风景画。
    爱伦堡就在这墙下，这窗前，这巨大书桌上，向世界不断发出强烈的光彩。
    我们又回到客厅来。下午的阳光正照满室内，——盆栽的花木，东方民族色彩的美丽墙毯和各种艺术品构成这室内一种烂缦色调。爱伦堡夫人穿着黑色长衣也来招待远方来客。在那面长桌上摆满食物，但我们就着窗下小圆桌围坐下来。记得十天以前，在《文学报》社，西蒙诺夫问我们：“爱伦堡他也想看到你们！”现在他和他的夫人，就向我们发问了关于中国语言及中国诗的问题。他说他读过法文译的毛主席的诗。他由诗的影响又问及目前中国文艺作品。我们也就向他提出关于他的长篇小说《暴风雨》的创作问题。
    他说到《暴风雨》中所描写的人物。
    他说这里面所有的人物都是他在生活当中看见的人。不过写的不仅仅是所看见的人，而是把看到的人的优点、缺点集中在一起而创造的人物。
    爱伦堡的话是简练而精深的：
    “不要像照像那样，看见一个人就把他反映出来。这不是作家。这可以到照像馆里去做事。作家需要的是典型。”关于这个问题他还说过：“《暴风雨》没有单独的独特主角。那里面写的是在战争中的法、德、苏联的知识分子。那里面的人物，只是一部分重要一些，一部分次要一些。《巴黎的陷落》也是如此。一个作家所写的英雄，不是根据一个人而是很多人，——外面所看见的，加上作家自己所创造的思想、性质。”
    说话引到搜集材料方面来。他说：“搜集材料只是为了布景。那是第三、第四等的事情，不是第一等的事情，那不是为了主题。内容，人物的思想都是从现实生活中体现出来的。作家描写的不是从前所看见的事实，而是按那些情形自己创造出来的。”
    关于生活，他认为：“作者不应以旁观地位看生活，而应当自己亲身参加生活。”他说：“否则，不能感动读者。”
    我们问：“创作过程中，人物是否不完全按照预先拟想的，而有所改变？”
    “刚写时，对于英雄怎样活动，还不是完全确定的。——只有在创作过程中，人物的状态才渐渐确定下来，如果处理得不对，自然也就发生了矛盾。”
    “写作中间修改多不多？”
    “写一章觉得不好，就从新写，写好了就写下去，不再修改了。”
    这时，从门廊里又传来电话铃声。这已是第二次了。他去接了电话回来，十分幽默地讲：“电话这个发明很不好，整天要你去接电话。”把大家都引笑了。
    我们的说话转到作品的主题方面来，他很肯定地回答：
    “从来没有先想写那个题目，而后去搜集材料，主题是从生活中体现出来的。
    “比如写《暴风雨》，那不是我的想像。因为现实中发生了战争，这部书的主题就是战争。至于书中的故事、情节，那不仅仅是所看见的，而是创造的。”在这里，爱伦堡指出非常宝贵的创作经验，他说：“比如现在我打算写《暴风雨》第二部，我就需要知道法国人民现在的生活。许多人对我讲了关于这方面的故事，可是我并不把这现成的故事写上去，我要写上去的将还是我自己所创造的。我并没有去参加斯大林格勒会战，可是我为什么能写斯大林格勒会战呢？那一方面固然是听了别人所讲的，一方面主要是因为我经历过其他战场上的战争生活。这样，我没有去，还是可以写。托尔斯泰写《战争与和平》，他并没有可能参加当时的战争，不过他确实参加过克里米亚战争。”他又着重地重叙了他的意见：“对作家来说，主要的不是搜集材料，而是参与生活。”
    “很大的危险，是一个人在二十岁上就成了专门作家。”我理解他的意思是说脱离了实际生活。“契诃夫是一个医生，他接见过各种各样的人，高尔基也是这样。作家从二十岁就做起，那很危险，不可能做好的作家，因为他不知道生活。”他十分幽默地微笑着加上一句：“学跳舞愈早愈好，做作家愈迟愈好。”
    我问他是否已经开始写《暴风雨》第二部？
    他说还没有。他说他现在正在写关于比利时、瑞典的文章。
    是的，我记得当我刚刚到达莫斯科时，别人告诉我：爱伦堡不在莫斯科。他原来是两个星期以前才从比利时、瑞典归来。说到这次出国旅行，爱伦堡夫人告诉我们一件十分有意义的事情。原来这次他是为了写《暴风雨》第二部，去了解目前法国人民生活的。可是法国政府害怕他，不准他进入巴黎。虽然当法国危难的时候，当法国人民抗德斗争的时候，爱伦堡曾经由于他对斗争的贡献，而获得法国近卫军军官的荣誉头衔，而且当时那还是由戴高乐签署发布的，可是现在，法国政府不准他进入巴黎。经过苏联大使馆努力交涉，想争取他能在巴黎停四十八小时。巴黎警察厅提出条件：只要他不写文章。可是马上他们又推翻这种想法了。这样，爱伦堡在飞机场也未逗留多久，从这飞机下来，被送上那一架飞机。于是，爱伦堡到法国附近的瑞典与比利时。不过，法国反动当局是无法在法国人民与爱伦堡之间筑一堵墙壁的。法国爱国人士通过那道禁令，而来到了比利时和瑞典。他们把他们目前的生活与斗争统统告诉给爱伦堡了。这事件，正说明爱伦堡，——反动统治者是怎样惧怕他，恨他，但为了和平而斗争的人民是怎样欢迎他，爱他。
    夕阳把窗玻璃染得金黄灿烂。
    访问将近两小时。当我们告别时，他以收在“火星”丛书中出版的新著《作家的声音》送给我们做纪念。让我们记着——这是一个多么好，又多么深刻的题目。让我们记着——爱伦堡那深沉的，坚毅的望着世界的眼睛和那走在保卫和平前列的步伐。当我从莫斯科回到北京，当我正在记述我这篇访问记的时候，爱伦堡已经不在莫斯科高尔基大街的住宅里，而又出现在布拉格，世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局会议上。当美联社记者提出挑拨性问题时，爱伦堡回答说：“在美国并没有朝鲜兵或中国兵，美军却在朝鲜屠杀着人民。谁是侵略者，道理很明白。”是的，这是真正的作家的声音，战斗的声音。
    【注】这是爱伦堡在巴黎保卫和平大会上的演讲辞中的首节。龙沙尔（Ronsard）是文艺复兴时期法国大诗人。鲁佛（Louvre）和伍菲齐（Uffizi）是有名的美术馆，前者在巴黎，后者在意大利翡冷翠。
