　　Elimination of the Summer Grain Shortage in Northeast China
    Chen Hengli
    The People's Daily published on August 18th: The phenomenon of the summer grain shortage has been basically eliminated in the vast rural areas of Northeast China this year. In the past, in the sixth and seventh months of each year, the working farmers in Northeast China always lacked grain, worried, and lived a hard life, both during the puppet Manchukuo period and during the Kuomintang rule. Now, this historical phenomenon of the lean season has been eliminated for the first time in Northeast China, and farmers even have surplus grain to sell. This is truly a major event in the economic life of the rural areas of Northeast China!
    Some people may ask: "Northeast China had a poor harvest in 1949, and the total grain output has not yet reached the level before 'August 15th'. How can it be enough to eat for the whole year, and even have surplus grain?" Yes, the superiority of the new social system is manifested here. Now let us study how the lean season phenomenon in Northeast China was eliminated.
    First, the feudal land system has been eliminated, and working farmers no longer pay "uncompensated outflow." Take 1943 as an example to calculate the items and quantities of "uncompensated outflow" of working farmers in Northeast China:
    (1) Land rent expenditure. In the past, more than 70% of the land in Northeast China belonged to the landlord class. The Kuomintang reactionary government's "Northeast Materials Adjustment Committee" also admitted: "More than 70% of the farmland in Northeast China is owned by a small number of people, 20-30%; conversely, more than 70% of farmers only have more than 20% of the farmland, and farmers without farmland account for more than 40%, mostly renting land." (Edited by the Pseudo-Northeast Materials Adjustment Committee: Northeast Economic Series "Resources and Industries" (page 33)). According to data from the Northeast People's Government People's Economic Planning Committee (hereinafter referred to as: Northeast Economic Planning Committee): In 1943, the total cultivated land area in Northeast China was 19,672,200 hectares (including Lushun and Dalian, and Inner Mongolia). Then the landlord class owned a total of 13,770,400 hectares (accounting for 70%). The average grain yield per hectare that year was 1,155 kg. The amount of land rent was about 40% of the production volume, so the average rent per hectare was 462 kg. That year, working farmers paid a total of 6,361,924 tons of rent to the landlords.
    (2) "Shipment" loss. The puppet Manchukuo "government" asked farmers to "ship" grain, calling it "purchase," but in reality, it was forced requisition. In 1943, the shipment volume in rural Northeast China was 7.66 million tons (Edited by the Pseudo-Northeast Materials Adjustment Committee: Northeast Economic Series "Agricultural Products" (Circulation Volume 2) page 197). The officially set price for "shipment" was much lower than the market price, and farmers lost about two-thirds, which is equivalent to a loss of 5 million tons.
    (3) "National tax" and local surcharges. The former was paid by the landlord class, and the amount was small, while the latter was paid by the farmers, and the amount was large. There is no material to illustrate the specific expenditure figures. During the Kuomintang rule, there was no "shipment," but there were many types of local surcharges, and the burden on farmers was particularly heavy. Before liberation, the agricultural tax in the Qinhuangdao coastal area in 1947-48 accounted for about 70% of the harvest.
    (4) Loan interest. The landlord class used part of its land rent income to lend at high interest rates, and urban speculative merchants also took advantage of the farmers' difficulties to lend to rural areas at high interest rates. There are no materials to illustrate the specific lending and interest payment figures. But just adding up the two items of land rent and "shipment" shows that the number of "uncompensated outflow" is alarming:
        Item          "Uncompensated Outflow" Amount (tons)
        Land Rent            6,361,924
        "Shipment"        5,000,000
        Total          11,361,924
    In 1943, the total grain (grain and oil) production was 19,371,000 tons (there are also some industrial crops that have not been calculated, because only the grain shortage is calculated). After deducting these two "uncompensated outflows," working farmers only had 8,009,076 tons of grain left. These items include human and animal consumption, and incalculable taxes and interest payments. The so-called "uncompensated outflow" refers to the means of production that were plundered from the working farmers by the reactionary government and the landlord class; once the old ruling institutions and the feudal land system are overthrown, these major "uncompensated outflows" are naturally cancelled. Now, the production results of the working farmers belong to the working farmers themselves. Farmers now also pay public grain, but this is for the construction of their own country, which is beneficial to the working farmers, and this cannot be regarded as an "uncompensated outflow."
    Second, the grain retention of working farmers has increased. The amount of grain retained by working farmers in 1943 was:
    (1) Total grain production was 19,371,000 tons.
    (2) "Uncompensated outflow" totaled 11,361,924 tons (taxes and interest payments are not calculated).
    (3) Compensated outflow: "Shipment" expenditure of 2,660,000 tons (one-third of the "shipment" was exchanged for necessities, but the grain was spent. Other daily use and production expenses are not calculated).
    Total expenditure was 14,021,924 tons.
    (4) Excluding "uncompensated outflow," the remaining amount was 5,349,076 tons.
    The amount of grain retained by working farmers in the winter of 1949 was:
    (1) The total grain production was 14.5 million tons (according to Comrade Gao Gang's report "Standing at the Forefront of Northeast Economic Construction").
    (2) "Uncompensated outflow" was cancelled.
    (3) "Compensated outflow" (used in the construction of People's China and exchanged for farmers' needed items): Public grain (natural grain) 2 million tons (Northeast Economic Planning Committee statistics). Sales volume 1.38 million tons (Comrade Gao Gang's previous report). Total 3.38 million tons.
    (4) Excluding "compensated outflow," the actual grain retention of working farmers was 11.12 million tons.
    Comparison between 1949 and 1943:
    Year            Retention (tons)        Index
    1943        5,349,076          100
    1949      11,120,000          207
    In the past, the grain retention of working farmers was insufficient, so there was a lean season every year. However, the landlord class had full granaries, and apart from a portion of lending, a considerable amount was wasted and rotten. Now, without the landlord class's accumulation and with the reduction of "compensated outflow," even in the case of a poor harvest, the grain retention of working farmers is more than 200% higher than before.
    Third, the rational exchange relationship between urban and rural areas means that working farmers are no longer exploited by under-the-table deals. In the past, the exploitation of working farmers by the old "government" and the landlord class was "legal" and open. In addition, working farmers were also subjected to various under-the-table exploitations. Before "September 18th," whenever the lean season arrived, urban speculative merchants would "buy green" from farmers. For example, if one jin of sorghum was worth ten yuan, "buying green" would only give five yuan. In less than a month or two, merchants would get a super-profit of 100%. During the puppet Manchukuo period, merchants secretly bought grain from landlords and sold it on the black market. Although they didn't "buy green," they received the same super-profits. The landlord class used its land rent income to spend and consume at will, and when the lean season arrived, it sold its surplus grain to farmers at high prices or lent to farmers at high interest rates. Working farmers suffered two layers of under-the-table losses between "buying green" and buying grain to make up for shortages. Farmers bought necessities and production tools, and the exchange of industrial and agricultural products was originally unequal. Merchants also exploited a layer of profit from the circulation process, and farmers suffered two more layers of under-the-table losses. Now, the exchange price between public commercial institutions and farmers is fair and reasonable, and guarantees the cheap supply of necessities and production tools. Today, the "compensated outflow" of working farmers is fundamentally different from the past.
    Fourth, the People's Government provides relief to disaster areas, organizes sideline production and provides agricultural loans. In 1949, in some areas of Northeast China that were more severely affected by disasters, such as some areas of western Liaoning and Rehe, as well as individual severely affected areas in each province, the People's Government organized sideline production. For example, Songjiang organized large-scale winter logging (forestry). Another example is that the CCP branch of Jianguo Village in the Sixth District of Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang organized farmers to dig dams to release water for fishing, rescuing 663 hectares of flooded land and selling fish for more than 800 million yuan. They bought 170 shi of grain, more than 7,000 chi of cloth, 57 heads of cattle and horses, and some farm implements. In addition, they rented 48 heads of cattle and completed the sowing task of 387 hectares of cultivated land and 90 hectares of wasteland, laying the foundation for this year's bumper harvest (Northeast Daily News, August 5). No one did this in the old society. The government generally issued agricultural loans to disaster areas, provided relief to severely affected areas, and organized mutual adjustment of grain among rural areas. Therefore, the severely affected areas have also roughly solved the summer grain shortage. The old "government" did not have these measures. The puppet Manchukuo also issued agricultural loans, but they were lent to "Dulong families" (households with assets and reliable), but not to poor farmers.
    Obviously, there is no need to prove that the two social systems are fundamentally different: the old social system was dark and despicable, bringing disasters to the working farmers. The new social system is bright and superior, bringing benefits to the working farmers. And the elimination of the lean season this year, and the surplus grain for farmers to sell, is a preliminary manifestation of the bright and superior new social system.

　　东北夏季粮荒的消除
    陈恒力
    人民日报八月十八日登载：东北广大农村今年已基本上消除了夏季粮荒的现象。从前，东北农村每年六、七月间，劳动农民总是缺粮，愁眉苦脸，度日如年，伪满时期如此，国民党统治时期也是如此。现在，这个青黄不接的历史性现象，在东北第一次得到消除，而且农民还有些余粮出售。这真是东北农村经济生活中的一件大事情！
    有人要问：“一九四九年东北歉收，粮食总产量还未达到‘八一五’以前的水平，怎么能全年够吃，而且有余粮呢？”是呀，新社会制度的优越性就表现在这里。现在我们来研究一下，东北青黄不接的现象到底是怎样消除的。
    第一、封建土地制度已经消灭，劳动农民再不支付“无偿流出”。试以一九四三年为例，计算一下东北劳动农民“无偿流出”的项目及其数量：
    （一）地租支出。从前，东北有百分之七十以上的土地属于地主阶级。国民党反动政府“东北物资调节委员会”也承认：“东北七成有奇之农地，为二、三成少数人所有；反之，七成以上之农民，仅有二成以上之农地，而无农地之农人，约占其四成有奇，多系租地耕种”（伪东北物资调节委员会编：东北经济小丛书《资源及产业》（上三十三页）。据东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会（下简称：东北经济计划委员会）资料：一九四三年，全东北耕地面积有一千九百六十七万二千公顷（包括旅大、内蒙）。那么地主阶级即共占有一千三百七十七万零四百公顷（占百分之七十）。该年度平均每公顷谷物产量为一千一百五十五公斤。地租额约为生产量的百分之四十，则一公顷平均交租量为四百六十二公斤。该年度劳动农民共向地主交租六百三十六万一千九百二十四吨。
    （二）“出荷”损失。伪满“政府”叫农民“出荷”，美其名曰“收买”，实际就是硬要。一九四三年东北农村出荷量为七百六十六万吨（伪东北物资调节委员会编：东北经济小丛书《农产》（流通篇下）一百九十七页）。“出荷”的官定价格比市价低得很多，农民约损失三分之二，计损失五百万吨。
    （三）“国课”和地方捐税。前者由地主阶级支付，数额很小，后者由农民支付，数额很大。具体支出数字没材料说明。在国民党统治时期，没有“出荷”，而地方捐税名目繁多，农民负担特重。解放前秦皇岛海滨区一九四七——四八年的农业税约占收获量的百分之七十。
    （四）借贷利息。地主阶级以其地租收入的一部高利放贷，城市投机商人乘农民困难的机会亦向农村高利放贷。具体放贷及支付利息数字，也没材料说明。但只把地租及“出荷”两项“无偿流出”加起来看，这个数字就很惊人：
        项目          “无偿流出”数额（吨）
        地租            六、三六一、九二四
        “出荷”        五、○○○、○○○
        合计          一一、三六一、九二四
    一九四三年，粮食（谷物及油料）总产量为一千九百三十七万一千吨（还有一部工艺作物未计算，因只计算粮荒之故）。除去这两项“无偿流出”，劳动农民只剩下粮食八百万零零九千零七十六吨。人畜食用及计算不出来的纳税、交息等等，就是这些指项。所谓“无偿流出”，是指劳动农民被反动政府和地主阶级掠夺去的生产物；旧统治机构及封建土地制度一经推翻，这几大笔“无偿流出”自然取消。现在，劳动农民的生产成果归劳动农民自己所有了。农民现在也出公粮，但这是为了建设自己的国家，对劳动农民是有利的，这不能算是“无偿流出”。
    第二、现在劳动农民的粮食保留量增加。一九四三年劳动农民保留粮食的数字是：
    （一）粮食总生产量为一九、三七一、○○○吨。
    （二）“无偿流出”计一一、三六一、九二四吨（纳税、交息未计算）。
    （三）有偿流出：“出荷”支出二、六六○、○○○吨（“出荷”的三分之一换回生活品，但粮食是支出去了。其他日用及生产费支出未计算）。
    支出合计一千四百零二万一千九百二十四吨。
    （四）除“无偿流出”，剩余五百三十四万九千零七十六吨。
    一九四九年冬季的劳动农民保留粮食的数量是：
    （一）粮食总生产额为一、四五○万吨（根据高岗同志“站在东北经济建设的最前面”的报告）。
    （二）“无偿流出”取消。
    （三）“有偿流出”（用在人民中国的建设及换回农民的需要物品）：公粮（自然粮）二百万吨（东北经济计划委员会统计）。出售量一百三十八万吨（高岗同志前项报告）。合计三百三十八万吨。
    （四）除“有偿流出”，劳动农民实际保留粮食一千一百一十二万吨。
    一九四九年与一九四三年比较：
    年度            保留量（吨）        指数
    一九四三        五、三四九、○七六          一○○
    一九四九      一一、一二○、○○○          二○七
    从前，劳动农民的粮食保留量不足，所以年年闹青黄不接。而地主阶级却粮食满仓，除掉一部分放贷，其余腐烂浪费的不少。现在，没有地主阶级的积存，“有偿流出”的减少，即令在歉收的情况下，劳动农民的粮食保留量也比从前多到百分之二百以上。
    第三、城乡交换关系的合理，劳动农民不再受到暗盘的剥削。从前，旧“政府”和地主阶级对于劳动农民的剥削是“合法”的、公开的，另外，劳动农民还受到种种暗盘的剥削。“九一八”之前，一到青黄不接，城市投机商人即向农民“买青”，比如高粱一斤值十元，“买青”只给五元。不到一、两个月，商人就得到百分之百的超额利润。伪满时期，商人暗中从地主那里买得粮食弄到黑市去买卖，虽不“买青”，而超额利润的收入是一样的。地主阶级以其地租所得，任情挥霍消耗，到青黄不接时，以其余粮高价卖给农民或向农民进行高利放贷。劳动农民在“买青”与买缺粮之间吃了两层暗亏。农民购买生活品及生产工具，工农业品的交换本来不等价，商人从流通过程中又剥削了一层利润，农民又吃了两层暗亏。现在，公营商业机构与农民的交换价格是公平的，合理的，并保证生活品及生产工具的廉价供给。今天劳动农民的“有偿流出”与从前是根本不相同了。
    第四、人民政府对灾区实行救济，组织副业生产与发放农业贷款。一九四九年东北某些受灾较重的地区，如辽西、热河的某些地区，以及各省中的个别重灾区，人民政府都组织了副业生产。比如，松江大规模组织冬季采伐（森林业）。又如，黑龙江肇源县六区建国村的中共支部组织农民挖坝放水捕鱼，救出涝地六百六十三垧，捕鱼卖钱八亿余元。买进一百七十石粮食，七千多尺布，五十七头牛马和一部分农具。另外，又租牛四十八头，完成了熟地三百八十七垧和开荒九十垧的播种任务，打下了今年丰收的基础（八月五日东北日报消息）。旧社会是没有人这样做的。政府对灾区普遍发放农贷，对重灾区实行救济，并组织农村间互相调剂粮食，因此，重灾区也都大致解决了夏季的粮荒。旧“政府”却没有这些措施。伪满也发放过农贷，但那是贷给“笃农家”（有资产，可信赖的农户），却不贷给穷苦农民。
    显然用不着证明，两个社会制度是根本不同的：旧社会制度是黑暗的、卑鄙的，给劳动农民带来的是灾祸。新社会制度是光明的、优越的，给劳动农民带来的是福利。而今年消除了青黄不接，且使农民有余粮出售，这是光明与优越的新社会制度的初步表现。
