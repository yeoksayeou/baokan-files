    Loan Grain Supports Agricultural and Fishery Production
    Solving the Main Difficulties of Farmers and Fishermen
    [Our Newspaper News] The People's Bank of China Tianjin Special District Office, based on the current time being the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvest, autumn plowing, autumn planting), and addressing the main production difficulties of the local people, has allocated 4.47 million jin of various loan grains. This loan grain is determined according to different regions; for disaster areas, it is mainly wheat seed, and for non-disaster areas engaged in fishery and sideline industries, it is mainly livestock fertilizer. Livestock loans total 1,065,000 jin, requiring the addition and preservation of 2,210 head of livestock. The target is mainly laboring farmers who lack animal power, have the ability to raise livestock but are unable to purchase or lack purchasing power. The purchase areas are mainly coordinated within the district, between disaster areas and non-disaster areas. Fertilizer loans total 565,000 jin, mainly used for wheat planting and gardens. Based on the local low fertilizer production and the people's fertilizing habits, it is proposed to support oil mills in ordering or purchasing from other places through supply and marketing cooperatives, so as to avoid competing with the people for purchases and causing fertilizer price fluctuations.
    In disaster areas, 1.77 million jin of wheat seed loans are issued, focusing on supporting severely affected households in heavy disaster areas to plant more wheat fields, in order to shorten the disaster period and stabilize the production mood of disaster victims; it is also for focusing on promoting and improving seeds to increase farmers' income. In addition, 1.07 million jin of fishery loans have been issued, in addition to supporting the organization of specialized fishery cooperatives, the focus is mainly on repairing boats and mending nets, followed by bamboo fences, weaving nets, fish shops, and ice cellars, etc., to solve the production difficulties of fishermen along the coast and rivers.

    贷粮扶植农渔业生产
    解决农民和渔民的主要困难
    【本报讯】中国人民银行天津专区办事处，根据当前正值三秋（秋收、秋耕、秋种）之际，针对当地群众在生产上的主要困难，拨发各种贷粮四百四十七万斤。此项贷粮按不同地区确定，灾区以贷麦种，渔副业非灾区以牲口肥料为主。计非灾区牲畜贷款一百零六万五千斤，要求增添与保存牲口二千二百一十头；其对象主要是以缺乏畜力、有饲养能力而无力购买及购买力不足的劳动农民。购买地区确定以本区内灾区与非灾区进行调剂为主。肥料贷款五十六万五千斤，主要用在种麦和园田上，根据当地产肥少，和群众施肥习惯，提出可以扶植油坊订购或通过供销社去外埠购买，以免到时与群众争购引起肥价波动。
    灾区贷放麦种一百七十七万斤，重点是扶植重灾区受灾户多播种麦田，以缩短灾期，稳定灾民生产情绪；同时也为了重点推广与改良籽种，以增加农民收入。此外还发放渔贷一百零七万斤，除扶植组织渔业专社外，主要以修船、补网等为重点，其次是打箔、织网、鱼店、冰窖等以解决沿海、河流渔民生产上的困难。
