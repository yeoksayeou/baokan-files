　　In Xihua County (Huangfanqu area), Huaiyang Prefecture, Henan Province, due to more than ten years of Yellow River flooding, farmers generally lack farm implements and livestock. In order to support farmers' production, the government issued 640 million yuan in loans for draught cattle in late August, and also purchased more than 5,000 pieces of farm implements to lend to farmers.
