　　Agricultural Labor Model Song Luoxue from Mancheng County, Hebei
    Overfulfills Production Increase Plan
    Improved Techniques and Requesting Seed Selection are Important Reasons for Production Increase
    [Our Newspaper] Song Luoxue, a farmer from Songjia Village, Mancheng County, Hebei Province, wrote to Chairman Mao, reporting on his family's agricultural production harvest this year, which exceeded the original production increase plan by more than 860 jin. He also explained that the achievement was due to paying attention to improving agricultural production techniques and emphasizing seed selection. The original letter is as follows:
Chairman Mao:
    Since being selected as a labor model last year, I have participated in the provincial economic conference and the agricultural conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, and I have also been elected as a member of the county people's government. I feel very honored. Without your wise leadership, the working people would never have this day. From participating in various conferences, I deeply understand that only by working hard, actively producing, and increasing income can the country become strong and the people live a good life. I am determined to do a good job in production this year, because only when my own production is good can I motivate others. Thanks to my efforts over the past year, I have completed an increase of 2,452 jin of grain, exceeding the production increase plan by 867 jin. Now I will report the details of my production this year to you.
  Mutual Aid, Exchanging Labor, and Engaging in Sideline Occupations, Buying Pigs and Accumulating Manure, Intensive Cultivation and Careful Work
    I know that organizing to develop production is the way to make farmers' lives prosperous. After returning from the provincial conference, I widely publicized this to the party members and masses in my village. Together with branch secretary Song Dongrong, branch committee members Song Luotian and Wang Xuan, we first found sixteen like-minded households and formed four long-term labor exchange groups. I and Song Zhi and other four households organized a labor exchange group. We started working in April. When pulling wheat, the four families had a total of 31 mu of wheat fields, and four people pulled it all in two days. That's an average of 4 mu per person per day. If we worked alone, each person could only pull 3 mu, saving two days of labor. We helped each other with tasks like pulling soil, transporting manure, sowing seeds, and pulling wheat. We used the saved labor to engage in sideline occupations. I participated in making agricultural tools at the village's wood factory. Whenever I had free time, I went to work at the factory. With a capital of 2 shi 9 dou of rice, I earned 5 shi 9 dou of rice in five months. I also took the time to sell small pigs several times, earning 1 shi of rice in just over a month. I and the cadres organized the planting of Korean yam seedlings, and each person received more than 130 jin of rice. We used the money we earned to buy sesame cakes to raise pigs. From last winter to this spring, we accumulated 160 cartloads of manure, achieving the plan of applying 8 and a half cartloads of fertilizer per mu, completing the task of exceeding the normal year (referring to the three-year average of 1947, 48, and 49) by 4 and a half cartloads per mu. The meticulousness of cultivating and planting various crops is also a major reason for my increased production.
    The government proposed the call for popularizing improved varieties in five years. I myself responded first. My family planted 8 mu of "Erbisi Cotton" (exceeding the original plan by 1 mu), 4 mu of "Huanong No. 4 Millet" (exceeding the original plan by 2 mu), 2 and a half mu of Korean yams (exceeding the original plan by half a mu), 3 mu of corn, half a mu of peanuts, and six fen of vegetables on my 18.6 mu of land. All the land was cultivated three times and harrowed four times. Corn and millet were soaked in warm water before sowing. There was also progress in the amount of fertilizer applied, cultivation techniques, and prevention and control of pests and diseases compared to previous years.
    Cotton: An average of 5 and a half cartloads of fertilizer and 50 jin of sesame cake were applied per mu of the 8 mu of cotton fields. Weeding was done seven times (exceeding the normal year by two times), and pruning was done three times. When aphids occurred in May this year, I quickly sprayed a dose of pesticide (rotenone soap solution), and all the aphids were eliminated. Fire spiders were discovered in July, which was very serious. We quickly treated them twice, and they did not become a major disaster. The most severely affected 1.5 mu of cotton had an average of two bolls per plant. Including the disaster, each mu can produce 100 jin of cotton, which is no less than the normal year's yield.
    Millet: Seven cartloads of fertilizer were applied per mu of the 4 mu of millet fields. When sowing, 30 jin of cottonseed cake and two loads of manure (50 jin per load) were also applied per mu. Weeding was done four times. Because field selection was carried out last year, the millet grew very well this year, and the ears were very neat. Although it suffered from flooding, Huanong No. 4 millet was more resistant to flooding, and each mu also produced 1 shi 5 shi dou, which is 75 jin more than the normal year.
    Yams: Thirteen cartloads of fertilizer were applied per mu of the 2.5 mu of Korean yams. Because there was no shortage of spring rain, weeding was not done nine times, but only six times. According to the current inspection, each plant can produce an average of 1.5 jin, and each mu is estimated to produce 3,000 jin (exceeding the normal year by 1,800 jin).
    Other crops: Each mu of the 3 mu of corn yielded 1 shi 3 dou. Each mu of the 6 mu of wheat yielded 9 dou. The half mu of peanuts is estimated to yield 200 jin.
    Total harvest this year: A total of 824 jin of cotton can be harvested. Including frost-after safflower, an average of 32 jin of lint cotton can be produced per 100 jin of seed cotton, for a total of 263.5 jin of lint cotton. Calculated at 9 jin of rice per jin of lint cotton, it can be exchanged for 2,371 jin of rice. A total of 780 jin of millet can be harvested, yielding 660 jin of rice (Huanong No. 4 millet can yield 85 jin of rice per 100 jin). A total of 7,500 jin of yams can be produced. Calculated at 6 jin of yams for 1 jin of rice, it equals 1,250 jin of rice. A total of 3 shi 9 dou of corn was harvested, equivalent to 514 jin of rice. 5 shi 4 dou of wheat is equivalent to 802 jin of rice (calculated at 9 dou of rice per shi of wheat). 200 jin of peanuts (1 jin of peanuts can be exchanged for 1.5 jin of millet) is equivalent to 240 jin of rice. The total income is 5,837 jin of millet, which is an increase of 2,452 jin compared to the normal year's yield (3,385 jin). This exceeds this year's production increase plan (the original plan for this year was to increase production by 1,580 jin) by 867 jin.
    Experiences in this year's production: It is necessary to learn agricultural production techniques. For example, Erbisi cotton has sparse branches and leaves that spread in all directions, occupying a large area, so it is appropriate to leave fewer seedlings. After understanding its characteristics, I planted large ridges this year with row spacing of 1.8 to 2.2 chi (in previous years, it was no more than 1.5 chi). Plant spacing was 1.5 to 1.8 chi (in previous years, it was 1.2 to 1.3 chi). In this way, the cotton is well-ventilated and grows vigorously. One mu of cotton field south of the village, which was lightly affected by the disaster, had an average of 12 large bolls per plant, with 1,500 plants per mu, totaling 18,000 bolls. Calculated at 80 bolls per jin of seed cotton, it can be picked for a total of 210-220 jin. Next to my plot, Luo Luozhang had one mu of cotton. He planted small ridges that were crowded and not ventilated, so the cotton grew weakly, with only 7-8 small bolls per plant. This year, the fire spiders were very fierce. I found that cotton fields planted with soybeans on the edge of the ridges were prone to fire spiders, and the infestation was also severe. Soybeans became a medium for fire spiders. I will never plant soybeans on the edge of cotton ridges again next year. In order to experiment, I planted six kinds of Korean yams in different areas of one plot this year, including "Nonglin No. 4," "Victory No. 100," "Thin Vine," "Red Vine," "Tiger Fruit," and "American Red." The fertilizer and cultivation were exactly the same. According to the current inspection, Nonglin No. 4 and Victory No. 100 are the best. The advantages are that the vines are short and easy to turn over, the yield is high, and they taste good. I will definitely promote them vigorously next year. American Red also tastes good, but the yield is poor. I am not sure how much the yields differ now.
  Guarantee to Plant Improved Varieties Next Year and Lead the Masses to Produce Well
    I guarantee to plant all improved varieties next year. I have conducted field selection and, according to the characteristics of Erbisi cotton introduced by the farm, marked the areas in 3 mu of cotton fields that were lightly affected by the disaster. I plan to pick the cotton that blooms in the middle and ensure single harvesting, single drying, and single ginning to ensure the purity of the seeds. I also personally helped more than 30 households mark the areas in their fields. In order to prevent drought, I and Song Luonian and other five households jointly borrowed a waterwheel after the wheat harvest to expand the paddy fields by 16 mu (3 mu of my own), completing the plan to expand the paddy fields. For sideline production, I have discussed with three households in the labor exchange group to open a vermicelli workshop this winter. At the same time, I guarantee that all the land will be plowed once in the autumn to lay the foundation for doing a good job in production next year.
    The above is my production situation this year. Please give me more instructions so that I can improve my production in the future. I want to lead the masses to produce well and take practical actions to oppose the aggression of American imperialism and defend world peace! With respect!

　　河北满城县农业劳模宋洛学
    超额完成增产计划
    改进技术请求选种是增产重要原因
    【本报讯】河北省满城县宋贾村农民宋洛学上书毛主席，报告今年他自己家庭农业生产的收成，比原来的增产计划还多收了八百六十余斤。他并说明，收到这样的成果，是因为处处注意改进农业生产技术和讲求选种之故。原信如下：毛主席：
    我自去年被选为劳动模范，今春先后参加了省经济会议和中央人民政府农业部召开的农业会议，又被选为县人民政府的委员，我觉得非常荣幸。如果没有你们的英明领导，劳动人民绝对不会有今天。从参加各种会议中，使我深刻明白了，只有努力劳动，积极生产，增加收入，国家才能富强，人民才能过好光景。我今年决心把生产搞好，因为只有自己的生产搞好，才能带动别人。由于我一年来的努力，完成了增产粮食两千四百五十二斤，超过了增产计划八百六十七斤。现在把我今年的生产情形，详细报告给你们。
  互助拨工又搞副业买猪积肥精耕细作
    我知道了：组织起来发展生产，是使农民生活走向富裕的道路，从省里开会回来，就向本村党员群众广泛宣传，又和支书宋冬荣、支委宋洛田、王宣，首先找十六户投脾气的人，组成了四个长年拨工组。我和宋志等四户组织拨工小组。从四月间就开始做活，在拔麦时四家共有三十一亩麦田，四个人两天就拔完了。合每天每人拔四亩，如果单干每人只能拔三亩，省工两个。拉土运粪耩地拉麦都互助合作。省出工来去搞副业。我参加了本村木厂作农具，每天一有空就到厂内作工，拿出二石九斗米的本钱，经营了五个月，即赚米五石九。还抽空贩了几趟小猪，一个多月赚了一石米。我与干部组织炕洋山药秧，每人也分米一百三十多斤。我们把赚的钱买了麻饼养猪。去冬今春积肥一百六十车，实现了每亩使肥八车半的计划，完成了每亩超常年（指一九四七、四八、四九年三年平均数）四车半的任务。各种作物耕作、刨种的细致，这也是我增产的主要原因。
    政府提出五年普及良种的号召，我自己首先响应，我家十八亩六分地，种了八亩“二比斯字棉”（超过原计划一亩），四亩“华农四号谷”（超过原计划二亩），二亩半洋山药（超过原计划半亩），还有三亩棒子，半亩花生，六分菜。全部土地作到了耕三耙四。棒子谷在播种时都进行了温汤浸种。在施肥数量，耕作技术，防除病虫害上，比往年也有了进步。
    棉花：八亩棉田平均每亩施肥五车半，麻饼五十斤。锄了七遍（超常年两遍），整枝三遍，今年五月发生蚜虫时，我很快喷射了一次药水（鱼藤粉胰子水合剂），蚜虫全部消灭了。七月间又发现了火蜘蛛，很严重，抓紧治了两遍，没成了重灾。受灾较严重的一亩半棉花，每棵平均两个桃儿，连受灾算在内，每亩能产一百市斤棉花，不次于常年产量。
    谷子：四亩谷子，每亩铺肥七车，耩时每亩还用了三十斤棉籽仁饼和两挑大粪（每挑五十斤）。锄了四遍。由于去年进行了田间选种，所以今年谷子长得很肥，穗头长得很整齐，虽然受了涝灾，华农四号谷抗涝性较强，每亩也产了一石五市斗，比常年多产七十五斤。
    山药：二亩半洋山药，每亩使肥十三车，因春雨不缺，未锄到九遍，只锄六遍。按现在检查，平均每棵能产一斤半，每亩估计能产三千斤（超过常年一千八百斤）。
    其它作物：三亩玉米，每亩收了一石三斗。六亩麦子每亩收了九斗。半亩花生估计能收二百斤。
    今年总收成：棉花共可收八百二十四斤，连霜后红花在内，平均每百斤籽棉可出三十二斤皮棉，共出皮棉二百六十三斤半。按每斤皮棉换九斤米算，可换米两千三百七十一斤。谷子共收七百八十斤能出米六百六十斤（华农四号谷每百斤可出米八十五斤）。山药共可产七千五百斤，按六斤山药换一斤米算，顶米一千二百五十斤。玉米共收三石九斗，折米五百一十四斤。五石四斗麦子折米八百零二斤（按每石麦折米九斗算的）。二百斤花生（一斤花生可换谷一斤半）折米二百四十斤。总共可收入小米五千八百三十七斤，比常年产量三千三百八十五斤），增产二千四百五十二斤。超过今年增产计划（今年原计划增产一千五百八十余斤）八百六十七斤。
    在今年生产中的体验：一定要学习农业生产技术，如二比斯字棉枝叶稀疏，向四面伸张，占面积较大，留苗宜稀。我了解了它的特点后，今年都是耩大垅，行距一尺八至二尺二（往年不过一尺五）。株距一尺五至一尺八（往年一尺二、三），这样棉花透风长得茂盛。村南受灾很轻的一亩棉田，每棵平均十二个大桃，每亩有一千五百棵，共合一万八千个桃子。按八十个桃子出籽棉一斤算，共能摘二百一、二十斤。紧挨着我这块地，罗洛掌有一亩棉花，他种的垅小行挤，不透风，长得很弱，每棵不过七八个小桃儿。今年闹火蜘蛛很厉害，我发现了棉花地耩豆边垅的，都容易发生火蜘蛛，闹的也严重，豆子成了火蜘蛛的媒介。明年耩棉绝不再耩豆边垅。为了作试验，今年在一块地里，分片种了六种洋山药，计有：“农林四号”、“胜利百号”、“细蔓”、“红蔓”、“虎果”、“美国红”。肥料耕作完全一样，按现在检查，以农林四号和胜利百号两种为最好。优点是蔓短好翻，产量大又好吃，明年一定要大力推广。美国红吃着也不错，但产量较差，究竟产量各差多少，现在还不敢肯定。
  保证明年种植良种带动群众好好生产
    保证明年全部种植优良品种。我已进行了田间选种，根据农场介绍的二比棉特点，在三亩受灾轻的棉地内，插示了标记，准备摘中喷花，并要作到单收、单晒、单轧，以保证种籽纯洁。我还亲自帮助三十多户群众，在地内作了标记。为了防旱，今年在麦收后，我和宋洛年等五户，合贷水车一辆，扩大水田十六亩（我自己三亩），完成了扩大水田计划。副业生产，已与拨工组内三户商量，今冬开粉房。同时保证全部土地进行秋耕一遍，以打下明年搞好生产的基础。
    以上就是我今年的生产情况，请你们多多指示，使我在今后的生产上得到改进。我要带动群众好好生产，以实际行动，来反对美帝国主义的侵略，保卫世界和平！  致以敬礼！
