　　People's Representatives Conference of Nine Districts in Beijing
    Writes a Letter of Respect to Chairman Mao
    Determined to Intensify Production, Strengthen Unity, and Expand Victory Achievements
    [Beijing News Agency] The People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in the Ninth District of Beijing concluded on August 26th, and passed a letter of respect to Chairman Mao. It is now published as follows:

    Respected Chairman Mao:
    The First People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in the Ninth District of Beijing has concluded victoriously. This is the democracy and happiness you have brought us. Before liberation, the Tianqiao area was considered a "lower class society" in the eyes of the reactionary ruling class. What we gained from our hard work was only the kicking, whipping, deception, and extortion of the reactionaries and their pawns; we lived in dilapidated houses, living next to garbage piles that had accumulated for more than ten years, muddy and uneven roads, and stinking puddles full of mosquitoes and flies, which became the reason for them to despise and ridicule us.

    Under your wise leadership, we quickly gained liberation. In the year since liberation, our district has smashed the rampant special agents, bandits, and local bullies, and established a people's democratic government. In the early days of liberation, the government considerately treated us with care when exchanging counterfeit gold yuan, and gave us a lot of relief. In a very short time, the garbage that had been accumulating for more than ten years was cleared. For the vendors, instead of the whipping and confinement of the Kuomintang reactionaries, markets were established and management was strengthened. In terms of municipal construction, many road surfaces and ditches have been repaired for us with emphasis. Even though finances and economy are still difficult, this year we are prepared to build a middle school and two primary schools for us. In addition, eleven public toilets and fifty sewage pools will be built. We deeply know that this happiness is given to us by you.

    In this conference of representatives from all walks of life, we truly demonstrated the democratic spirit of everyone handling their own affairs and managing their own government. The representatives listened to the district people's government's work report for one year and four months and the cadre style inspection report at the meeting, and expressed their opinions, deliberated 1,809 proposals, and made resolutions on four issues related to the people's welfare, public security, road repair, and housing in the district, so that the current welfare issues of the people in the district have been properly resolved. This is a great joy for us.

    Dear Chairman Mao! We have realized your wise leadership from our own life experience. We must consolidate and expand our victory achievements, intensify production, and strive for further improvement of the country's financial situation. We express our utmost indignation at the crimes of US imperialism in armed obstruction of our country's liberation of Taiwan and armed aggression against Korea, and we are determined to step up unity and continue to expand the peace signature campaign to oppose the US imperialist conspiracy to instigate war.

    Finally, we, on behalf of the 120,000 people in this district, pay our highest respect to you and wish you good health!

    The First People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in the Ninth District of Beijing
    August 26, 1950

　　京市九区人民代表会议
    写信向毛主席致敬
    决心加紧生产加强团结扩大胜利成果
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市第九区各界人民代表会议于八月二十六日闭幕时，曾通过向毛主席致敬信一件。现特发表如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    北京市第九区第一次各界人民代表会议胜利闭幕了，这是您带给我们的民主与幸福。在解放前我们天桥一带是反动统治阶级眼中的“下等社会”，我们辛勤劳动所得到的，只是反动派及其爪牙们的脚踢、鞭打与欺骗敲诈；我们住在破烂不堪的房子里，生活在堆积十多年的垃圾堆，泥泞不平的道路与充满蚊子苍蝇的臭水坑旁边，反而成为他们鄙视讥讽我们的理由。
    在您的英明领导下，使我们很快的得到翻身。解放一年多来，我们区里打垮了横行霸道的特务匪徒和恶霸势力，建立了人民民主政权。在解放初期，兑换伪金圆券时，政府体贴入微地优待了我们，且给过我们不少的救济。在很短的时间内，又清除了积压十多年的垃圾。对摊贩是以建立市场加强管理来代替国民党反动派的鞭打与禁闭。市政建设上已经给我们有重点地整修了许多路面与地沟。在财政经济尚困难的时候，本年度还准备替我们建立中学一所、小学两所。另外还要建筑十一座公厕与五十座秽水池。我们深深知道这些幸福是您给我们的。
    我们在这次各界代表会议中，真正表现了大家的事情大家办，自己的政府自己管的民主精神。代表们在会上听取了区人民政府一年又四个月的工作与干部作风检查报告，并发表了自己的意见，审议了一千八百零九件议案，对有关全区人民的卫生治安修整土路和房屋等四个问题做出决议，使本区人民当前的福利问题得到了适当的解决。这是我们的大喜事。
    亲爱的毛主席！我们从自己的生活经验中体会到您的英明领导。我们一定要巩固和扩大自己的胜利成果，加紧生产，为争取国家财政状况的进一步好转而努力。对于美帝国主义武装阻挠我国解放台湾和武装侵略朝鲜等罪行，我们表示万分愤慨，决定加紧团结，继续扩大和平签名运动来反对美帝国主义挑动战争的阴谋。
    最后我们代表本区十二万人民向您致崇高敬礼，并祝您健康！
    北京市第九区第一次各界人民代表会议
    一九五○年八月二十六日
