　　Reflections After Visiting Beijing and Tianjin
    Northwest Ethnic Groups Visiting Delegation

    Our Northwest Ethnic Groups Visiting Delegation is composed of 40 members, including ten different ethnic groups: Hui, Kazakh, Uyghur, Tibetan, Mongol, Kyrgyz, Tu, Salar, Dongxiang, and Han. We departed from Xi'an on August 4th, and it has been over a month now. During this month, we received a warm welcome and solicitous hospitality from our government and people from all walks of life in Beijing and Tianjin. Under the assistance and guidance of responsible comrades from various institutions, factories, and schools, we successfully completed our visiting mission in a short period. As we return west, all our members, in addition to expressing our sincerest gratitude to all leaders and brothers from all ethnic groups and all walks of life, will briefly describe our observations and feelings of the past month as follows.

    The delegation visited the Shijingshan Power Plant, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Farm Implement Factory, State-owned China Textile Factory No. 1, privately-owned Dongya and Renli Woolen Mills, Tianjin Paper Mill, North China Leather Factory and other industrial constructions; Renmin University, Tsinghua University, Mongolian and Tibetan School, Hui People's College, Beijing Library and other cultural and educational institutions; the Forbidden City, Beihai Park, Summer Palace and other scenic spots and historical sites, as well as the Tanggu New Port project, etc., in Beijing and Tianjin. In each place, we received exceptionally warm welcomes and incredibly kind treatment, which first made us deeply feel that under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the brothers in the interior have fully demonstrated a high degree of love for fraternal ethnic friendship, and the feelings between all ethnic groups in China have been smoothly exchanged. We should first thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for this great achievement.

    When we presented a banner and gifts to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Premier Zhou in Huairen Hall, we saw the infinitely joyful and happy demeanor of our leaders, which made us deeply realize the concern and love of the leaders for us. Commander-in-Chief Zhu repeatedly stated in his speech that in the past, the Han people had wronged the minority ethnic brothers, and the minority ethnic groups had suffered too much oppression. In the future, the People's Government will gradually help the minority ethnic brothers gradually restore and develop. We were all moved to tears when we heard this.

    When visiting various factories, the responsible comrades introduced in detail the production conditions of each factory before and after liberation, and led us to visit the selfless work of the workers on the spot. From this, we learned that the production organizations under imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism are significantly different from the people's production organizations after liberation, and the productivity is also very different. We understand that all production can only be rationally developed by organizing workers, educating workers, and relying on workers; we are more clearly aware that the power of workers is great and sacred, and everything is created by labor. This beginning of the industrialization development of the new China fully demonstrates the happy future and increases our infinite excitement and hope.

    After visiting cultural and educational institutions, we realized that past culture and education served feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and served a small number of people in the reactionary ruling class. Today's cultural and educational construction is aimed at the masses of the people, especially various schools that specially take care of the children of ethnic minorities. This is completely different from the style of cultural education under reactionary rule that exclusively excludes children of ethnic minorities. As the Common Program states: "The culture and education of the People's Republic of China shall be new-democratic, that is, national, scientific, and mass-based culture and education." Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is it possible to practice this new cultural and educational policy.

    In the Capital Production and Education Institute, we saw that the children who suffered in the old society were turned over and transformed. This is truly a great undertaking and is the most touching to us. Only the people's own government can have the great confidence and strength to complete this undertaking.

    In short, in this short month, we have received a lot of education and learned a lot of new knowledge. Everyone has jointly experienced that people who grew up in the old society, especially our ethnic minorities, are relatively backward in terms of knowledge, experience, and ability. Therefore, everyone has unanimously made the determination to learn, and all are willing to bring the various understandings and knowledge gained from this visit back to various places and universally tell the vast number of people of all ethnic groups, so that they can all understand that the central government cares so much about ethnic minorities, and the construction of the new China is progressing so rapidly. Our delegation members are even more willing to contribute all our strength to build an equal, mutually-assisted, and friendly national family, and to build our new Northwest and new China. Finally, let us cheer and congratulate:

    Long live the great unity of all ethnic groups in China!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the great people's leader Chairman Mao!

### 参观京津后的感想  西北各民族参观团

　　参观京津后的感想
    西北各民族参观团
    我们西北各民族参观团，是由团员四十名组成的，包括回族、哈萨克族、维吾尔族、藏族、蒙族、柯尔克孜族、土族、撒拉族、东乡族及汉族等十个不同的民族。我们于八月四日由西安出发，到今天已经一月多了。这一月里我们在京、津两地蒙受了我们政府和各界人士的热烈欢迎与殷勤招待。在各机关、各工厂、各学校负责同志的协助指导之下，我们在短短的期间内胜利的完成了参观任务。现当我们西返之际，我们全体团员除以最诚挚的热情向各首长和各族各界的兄弟们致以最诚恳的谢意外，并将一月来的观感略述于后。
    本团在京津各地先后参观了石景山发电厂、石景山钢铁厂、农具制造厂，国营中纺一厂，私营东亚、仁立毛织厂，天津造纸厂、华北制革厂等工业建设；革大、清华、蒙藏学校、回民学院、北京图书馆等文教机关；故宫、北海、颐和园等名胜古迹，以及塘沽新港工程等等。在各地同样的受到了无比热烈的欢迎与无比亲切的招待，因而首先使我们深深感到在中国共产党和毛主席英明正确的领导下，内地的兄弟们已经充分的发挥着高度的兄弟民族友谊的热爱，中国各民族之间的感情已经畅通的交流起来了。这种伟大的收获，我们首先应该感谢中国共产党和毛主席。
    当我们在怀仁堂给毛主席、朱总司令、周总理献旗献礼的时候，看到了我们领袖的充满着无限愉快和喜悦的丰采，使我们深刻地体会到领袖对我们的关心与厚爱。朱总司令在讲话中一再表示，过去汉族对不起少数兄弟民族，使少数民族受到的压迫太重了，今后人民政府要逐渐帮助少数兄弟民族逐步恢复与发展。我们听了都感动的流下泪来。
    在参观各工厂的时候，负责同志们详尽地介绍了各厂解放前后的生产状况，并带领我们实地参观了工人们忘我的工作情况，从而我们知道了帝国主义、官僚资本主义统治下的生产机构和解放后人民的生产机构有着极显著的不同，生产力也有着很大的差别，我们明白了一切生产只有组织工人，教育工人，依靠工人才能得到合理的发展；我们更清楚的认识到工人力量是伟大的、神圣的，一切是劳动创造的。这一切新中国工业化发展的开端，充分的显示着幸福的将来，使我们增加了无限的兴奋与希望。
    在参观文教机关以后，我们认识到：过去的文化教育是替封建主义、帝国主义、官僚资本主义服务的，是给反动统治阶级的少数人服务的，今天的文教建设是朝着人民大众的，尤其各学校都特别照顾少数民族的子弟，这与反动统治下的文化教育专门排斥少数民族子弟的作风是截然不同了。正如共同纲领所说：“中华人民共和国的文化教育为新民主主义的，即民族的、科学的、大众的文化教育。”只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，才有可能实践这种新的文教方针。
    在首都生产教养院里，我们看到在旧社会中遭受苦难的子女得到了翻身，得到了改造。这真是伟大的事业，是使我们最受感动的。只有人民自己的政府，才能有完成这种事业的伟大的信心和力量。
    总之，我们在这短短的一月中，受到了不少教育，学习了不少的新鲜知识，大家共同体验到从旧社会成长的人们，特别是我们少数民族，知识、经验、能力各方面都比较落后，所以大家一致的下了学习的决心，并都愿把这次参观所得到的种种认识与了解带回各地去，普遍的告诉给广大的各族人民，使他们都能了解到中央对少数民族是如此的关心，新中国的建设事业是这样的突飞猛进。我们团员本身更愿贡献出全部力量为建设平等、互助、友爱的民族大家庭，为建设我们的新西北、新中国而奋斗。最后让我们欢呼祝贺：
    中华各民族大团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
