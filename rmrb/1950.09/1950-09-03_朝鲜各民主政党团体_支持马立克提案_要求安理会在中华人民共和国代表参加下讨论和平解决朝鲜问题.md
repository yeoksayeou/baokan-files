Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 2nd: Local newspapers have been publishing talks by responsible individuals from various Korean democratic political parties and social organizations for several days, unanimously supporting the proposal made by Soviet representative Malik at the Security Council regarding stopping American imperialism's aggression against Korea and resolving the Korean issue through peaceful means.

　　North Korean Democratic Party Vice Chairman Zheng Shengyan stated: American imperialism's representative to the Security Council, Austin, and the representatives of America's servant countries, are attempting to use the "Security Council decision" as a guise to conceal American imperialism's aggression against our country. Soviet representative Malik has exposed the American imperialists' conspiracy and is working to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The Korean people fully support this proposal by the Soviet representative; and resolutely demand that the Security Council stop the war of aggression, withdraw foreign troops from Korea; listen to the opinions of the North Korean representatives; and discuss ways to peacefully resolve the Korean issue with representatives of the People's Republic of China participating. The Korean people believe that the immediate cessation of American armed intervention in Korea and the withdrawal of American invading troops from Korea is the current task of the United Nations. If the American imperialists and their servants continue to use the United Nations as a tool for their aggression, using it to fabricate various illegal "decisions," then the Korean people will never recognize the illegal "decisions" and will never slacken in their struggle to eliminate the remnants of the Li Chengwan bandit gang and expel the American invading troops from our territory.
    
　　North Korean General Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Cui Jingde stated: The Soviet representative's proposal reflects the will of peace-loving people all over the world. All the Korean people, headed by the working class, absolutely support this proposal. To peacefully resolve the Korean issue, American invading troops must first be withdrawn from Korea. When the Security Council discusses the Korean issue, it must listen to the opinions of representatives from both North and South Korea: and there must be representatives from the People's Republic of China participating, because the People's Republic of China strives for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and is directly concerned about the peace and security of the Far East.

　　North Korean Farmers' Alliance Chairman Jiang Jingan stated: All Korean farmers resolutely demand that the Security Council accept the Soviet representative's proposal. The Soviet proposal demonstrates the Soviet Union's consistent peaceful policy and its just position.

　　North Korean Democratic Youth League Chairman Xuan Zhengmin stated: The Security Council's discussion of the Korean issue allows the Korean people and all good people in the world to further recognize who are their friends and who are their enemies. If the American imperialists reject the Soviet Union's just proposal, all Korean youth will, together with the people of the whole country, more resolutely fight to eliminate the enemy and accomplish the great cause of the reunification and freedom of the motherland.

　　North Korean Democratic Women's League Vice Chairman Li Jinshun stated: Without the participation of Korean people's representatives in the Security Council, there can be no discussion of issues related to the survival, interests, and happiness of the Korean people. The power of the Korean people is infinite, and it is sufficient to eliminate the invaders.

　　South Korean Democratic Women's League Chairman Liu Yingjun, South Korean Laboring People's Party Chairman Li Ying, and North Korean Chendogyo Young Friends Party Vice Chairman Pu Yunjie, also unanimously expressed their full support for Malik's proposal.

　　朝鲜各民主政党团体
    支持马立克提案
    要求安理会在中华人民共和国代表参加下讨论和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社平壤二日电】此间各报连日刊载朝鲜各民主政党和社会团体负责人的谈话，一致支持苏联代表马立克在安理会上所提出的关于制止美帝侵略朝鲜、以和平方法解决朝鲜问题的提案。
    北朝鲜民主党副委员长郑圣彦称：美帝国主义驻安理会代表奥斯汀及美国的仆从国家代表，企图利用“安理会决定”的招牌，来掩盖美帝国主义对我国的侵略。苏联代表马立克揭露了美帝国主义的阴谋，正为和平解决朝鲜问题而努力。朝鲜人民完全支持苏联代表的这一提案；并坚决要求安理会制止侵略战争，使外国军队撤出朝鲜；听取北朝鲜代表的意见；并在中华人民共和国代表参加下，讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的办法。朝鲜人民认为早日制止美国对朝鲜的武装干涉，使美国侵略军队撤出朝鲜，乃是联合国的当前任务。如果美帝国主义者及其仆从，仍然以联合国为其侵略工具，借此捏造各项非法“决定”，那末，朝鲜人民对非法的“决定”决不承认，也决不松懈其为消灭李承晚残余匪帮及驱逐美国侵略军队出境的斗争。
    北朝鲜职业总同盟委员长崔璟德称：苏联代表的提案，反映了全世界爱好和平人民的意志。以工人阶级为首的全朝鲜人民，绝对支持这一提议。欲和平解决朝鲜问题，首先须使美国侵略军队撤出朝鲜。安理会在讨论朝鲜问题时，必须听取南北朝鲜双方代表的意见：且必须有中华人民共和国的代表参加，因为中华人民共和国力求和平解决朝鲜问题，并直接关心着远东的和平安全。
    北朝鲜农民同盟委员长姜镇乾称：全朝鲜农民坚决要求安理会接受苏联代表的提案。苏联的提案表现出苏联一贯的和平政策及其正义立场。
    北朝鲜民主青年同盟委员长玄正民称：安理会关于朝鲜问题的讨论，使朝鲜人民和全世界一切善良的人民，进一步认清了谁是自己的朋友，谁是自己的敌人。假如美帝国主义者拒绝苏联的正义提案，朝鲜全体青年将和全国人民一起，更加坚决地进行斗争，消灭敌人，完成祖国统一、自由的伟业。
    北朝鲜民主妇女同盟副委员长李金顺谈称：没有朝鲜人民代表参加安理会，就不能讨论有关朝鲜人民的生存利益及幸福的问题。朝鲜人民的力量是无穷的，它足以消灭侵略者。
    南朝鲜民主妇女同盟委员长刘英俊、南朝鲜勤劳人民党委员长李英，和北朝鲜天道教青友党副委员长朴允吉等，也一致表示完全支持马立克的提案。
