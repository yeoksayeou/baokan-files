　　The Iranian people, under the leadership of the Iranian People's Party, are currently engaged in a heroic struggle against American and British imperialism and their reactionary lackeys. The Iranian people firmly believe that their struggle will eventually be victorious - this is what the Iranian youth representatives Aykbetani and Mansouri Kasan expressed to me with full confidence during my visit. He went on to say: "We will also follow the same path as the new China!"

　　These two representatives were delighted to have the opportunity to see the victorious New China and said that they would bring the facts of the Chinese people's victory and their valuable experience back to Iran.

　　They recounted the historical facts of imperialist aggression: starting with the British Empire's control of the Iranian economy and the establishment of the "Anglo-Iranian Oil Company," and continuing to the post-World War II era when the American Empire replaced the British Empire, seizing Iranian oil fields and exploiting and oppressing the Iranian people. On the other hand, the Soviet Union unconditionally returned all the privileges of the Tsarist era to Iran. During the war, the Soviet Union helped the people of northern Iran liberate themselves from the rule of the Reza Khan reactionary dynasty, and northern Iran gained freedom and happiness. This stark contrast made the Iranian people realize who is the enemy and who is the friend.

　　In 1946, the Soviet army withdrew from northern Iran, and the American Empire supported the reactionaries to gradually invade the north. From 1947 to 1949, 15,000 patriotic democrats were murdered. At the same time, the American Empire imported large quantities of goods and controlled the entire Iranian market. The Iranian people were increasingly plunged into a tragic situation: workers worked 15 to 18 hours a day, but their day's labor could not buy even a third of a pound of bread; farmers paid land rent, water rent, seed rent, and livestock rent to landlords, but had no food to eat themselves; as a result, imperialism and reactionaries created more than one million unemployed people in Iran.

　　In order to strive for independence, autonomy and peace, the Iranian people united around the People's Party and resolutely resisted the invaders through strikes and class boycotts. Four thousand five hundred Iranian university students have been on strike for two months since May this year. During World Youth Week, slogans were posted all over the cities: "We want bread, not cannons!" "Don't fight against the friendly Soviet Union!" These slogans were posted directly to the palace and to the British and American embassies. In Tehran, the capital of Iran, the peace signature campaign was in full swing, with more than 50,000 signatures. And this was carried out under the bloody suppression of the reactionaries (anyone found in possession of a peace signature book was sent to prison).

　　The Iranian people's heroic struggle is in full swing. With the support of the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries, and the working people of the world, the Iranian people's struggle is not alone! And they will surely embark on the road to victory! (Attached picture)

### 伊朗人民分清了敌友  访问伊朗代表艾克贝塔尼和满苏里喀山

　　伊朗人民分清了敌友
    访问伊朗代表艾克贝塔尼和满苏里喀山
    伊朗人民现正在伊朗人民党的领导下，和美英帝国主义及其豢养的反动派进行着英勇的斗争，伊朗人民坚信：他们的斗争将来一定会胜利——当我访问伊朗青年代表艾克贝塔尼和满苏里喀山的时候。他们充满信心地这样表示着。他接着告诉我：“我们也会走上和新中国同样的道路！”
    这两位代表由于获得这次机会能够看见已经胜利了的新中国而喜悦，他们说：将把亲眼看到中国人民胜利的事实和宝贵经验带回伊朗去。
    他们叙述着帝国主义的侵略史实：从英帝控制伊朗经济，开设“英伊石油公司”说起，直讲到第二次大战后美帝代替了英帝，攫取伊朗油田，剥削、压迫伊朗人民。而另一方面，苏联把沙俄时代的一切特权无条件地归还伊朗。大战中苏联帮助伊朗北部人民从李查汗反动王朝的统治下解放出来，伊朗北部获得了自由和幸福。这鲜明的对比，使伊朗人民认识了谁是敌人，谁是朋友。
    一九四六年苏联军队自伊朗北部撤退，美帝扶植反动派逐步北侵，一九四七至一九四九年，残杀了爱国民主分子一万五千人。同时美帝大量输入商品，控制伊朗整个市场。伊朗人民日益陷入悲惨的境地：工人每天工作达十五至十八小时，而一天辛劳所得买不到三分之一磅面包；农民向地主纳地租、水租、种子租、牲畜租以外自己却没有饭吃；结果，帝国主义和反动派在伊朗造成一百万以上的失业人群。
    为了争取独立、自主与和平，伊朗人民团结在人民党的周围，以罢工、罢课种种方式坚决反抗侵略者。伊朗大学生四千五百人，从今年五月起坚持罢课两个月。世界青年周时，都市中满街贴着标语“我们要面包，不要大炮！”“不和友邦苏联打仗！”这些标语直贴到皇宫，贴到英美使馆。在伊朗京城德黑兰，和平签名运动高涨，签名者超过五万人。而这是在反动派血腥镇压（凡藏有和平签名书者即送往监狱）下进行的。
    伊朗人民的英勇斗争，正在热烈进行着，有苏联、各新民主主义国家以及全世界劳动人民的支援，伊朗人民的斗争并不是孤单的！并且一定能走上胜利之路！（附图片）
