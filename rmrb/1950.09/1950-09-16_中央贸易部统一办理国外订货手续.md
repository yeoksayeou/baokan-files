Xinhua News Agency, 13th -- The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, with the approval of the Government Administration Council, issued a notice stipulating that all central and local government agencies, military units, and organizations must, in the future, follow certain procedures when placing planned orders from abroad. These orders must first be approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, and then uniformly handled by the Ministry of Trade, in order to avoid unnecessary confusion in reception and settlement. As for those who have not handled it this way in the past, they must immediately contact the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government to complete the procedures.

　　中央贸易部统一办理国外订货手续
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府贸易部呈经政务院批准，发出通知一件，规定中央及地方各机关、部队、团体，今后向国外有计划订货时，必须按一定手续，先经中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会批准，然后一律交由贸易部统一向外办理，以免接收与结算上发生不必要的混乱现象。至于过去未如此办理者，须即向中央人民政府贸易部接洽补办手续。
