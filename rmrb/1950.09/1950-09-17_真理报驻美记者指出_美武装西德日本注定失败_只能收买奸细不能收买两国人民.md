　　Xinhua News Agency, 16th. TASS Moscow, 14th: *Pravda* correspondents Rasadin and Filippov report from New York that the American military is frantically trying to scrape together mercenaries for their adventure in Korea. According to the official statement by Truman, the United States currently has five divisions, approximately 100,000 men, in Korea. Moreover, American generals and diplomats continue to demand that their satellite countries send more troops to Korea, in order to first throw cannon fodder from the North Atlantic Treaty nations into the furnace of war, to replace American soldiers. They are applying pressure to Western Europe, demanding that France, the Netherlands, and Belgium send new divisions. Even Luxembourg's "grand" army is being used as a last resort. However, Wall Street is particularly pinning its hopes on West Germany and Japan. The criminal plan of the American aggressor bloc is to turn these two countries into hotbeds for militarism, making Germans and Japanese serve as cannon fodder.
    The warmongers are feverishly and frantically organizing a West German army. The same frantic situation can be seen in Japan. MacArthur's order to add 75,000 police reservists is only the first step in rearming Japan. Rumors are already circulating about assigning air force units to the "police." But the question is whether the magnates of Wall Street can find enough fools willing to save the lives of American monopolies. The American ruling clique, blinded by its plans for world hegemony, is frantically scraping together cannon fodder for its future military adventures. They hire Hitler's generals and do not hesitate to hire Japanese war criminals. The likes of Yoshida and Adenauer are serving them.
    But Rasadin and Filippov point out that although they may be able to buy over many German and Japanese adventurers and traitors to serve them, they will never be able to buy over the souls of the German and Japanese people. The German and Japanese people have fresh memories of the horrors of the last war, and it is impossible for them to obediently sacrifice their lives according to Wall Street's commands.

### 真理报驻美记者指出  美武装西德日本注定失败  只能收买奸细不能收买两国人民

　　真理报驻美记者指出
    美武装西德日本注定失败
    只能收买奸细不能收买两国人民
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：真理报记者拉萨丁与费利波夫自纽约报道，美国军方疯狂地努力搜罗雇佣兵以进行朝鲜的冒险。根据杜鲁门发表的官方声明，美国现有五个师约十万人在朝鲜。而且，美国的将军们与外交家们继续要求其卫星国家派更多军队至朝鲜，以便把自北大西洋公约国家得来的炮灰首先投入战争的熔炉，来代替美国兵士。他们对西欧施用压力，要求法国、荷兰、比利时派遣新的师团。甚至卢森堡的“大”军也被拿来作孤注一掷。但是，华尔街特别把希望寄托于西德与日本。美国侵略集团的罪恶计划是使这两个国家变为孕育军国主义的地盘，使德国人与日本人充当炮灰。
    战争贩子们正狂热地、慌忙地组织西德陆军。在日本，也可以看到同样的慌忙情形。麦克阿瑟发出的关于增设七万五千名警察后备队的命令，只是重整日本军备的第一步骤。已有谣言盛传要分给“警察”以空军部队。但是问题在于华尔街的巨头们是否能够找到足够愿为美国的垄断企业救命的傻瓜。美国的统治集团已为其称霸世界的计划冲昏了头脑，他们正疯狂地为他们将来的军事冒险搜罗炮灰。他们雇用希特勒的将军们，也不惜雇用日本战犯。吉田与阿登纳之流正在为他们服务。
    但是拉萨丁与费利波夫指出，他们虽然也许能收买许多德国与日本的冒险家与奸细为他们服务，却永不能收买德、日两国人民的灵魂。上次战争的恐怖，德国人民与日本人民记忆犹新，要他们驯服地遵照华尔街的命令牺牲生命是不可能的。
