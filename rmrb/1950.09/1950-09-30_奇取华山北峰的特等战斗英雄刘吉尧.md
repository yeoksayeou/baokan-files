　　Liu Jiyao, Special Class Combat Hero Who Ingeniously Seized the North Peak of Mount Hua
　　Li Li
　　On June 14, 1949, Comrade Liu Jiyao, a staff officer of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, led six scouts with the help of a woodcutter, Wang Yinsheng, climbing cliffs and overcoming numerous difficulties, descending like heavenly soldiers. Without the enemy's awareness, they suddenly penetrated the enemy's position, cleverly captured the North Peak of Mount Hua, eliminated the bandits of Han Zipei's Sixth Security Brigade of the Kuomintang in Shaanxi, and removed the obstacles on the westward route of the field army in North China, enabling our army to advance smoothly along the Longhai Railway to the west and quickly engage in the great battle to liberate the Northwest. This is a miracle, a miracle that only the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu can create.

  (I)
　　After the liberation of Huayin, the bandit troops of Han Zipei's Sixth Security Brigade of the Kuomintang fled to Mount Hua. Entrenched there, they acted recklessly, raping Taoist nuns, felling trees, destroying the scenic spots of China's West Mountain, and threatening the safety of the railway traffic from Huayin to Tongguan. The Dali Sub-district ordered our Ludong (East of the Road) General Detachment to liberate Mount Hua and consolidate transportation. The Ludong General Detachment assigned the task of scouting the mountain roads to Liu Jiyao.

　　Liu Jiyao took ten scouts and arrived at the Huangfuyu Pass at the foot of Mount Hua on June 1st. They scouted here for four days without any results. The locals said: There is only one main road up the mountain, and even on this main road, one must pass through many dangerous places such as "Single-Log Bridge," "Thousand-Foot Window," "Hawk Turns Over," and "Old Man Leaning in the Gully." The mountain is forty miles high, the road is narrow, the wind is strong, and when encountering miasma, even birds have difficulty spreading their wings.

　　Later, with great difficulty, a clue was obtained from a seventy-year-old man, who said: It is rumored that if you go south forty miles from Huangfuyu Pass to the south of Mount Hua, there is a "Orangutan Gully" that can lead up the mountain, but there is no road there, only steep cliffs. Comrade Liu Jiyao decided to take everyone to scout Orangutan Gully again, determined to find a path up the mountain, even if there were ten thousand difficulties.

　　On the way to Orangutan Gully, towering mountains stood on both sides, and the trees on the mountains blocked out the sun. There were no houses to be seen for forty miles. After walking for a day, they finally left the valley, and there was a small village called Liangchakou (Two-Fork Opening) at the south of the valley. As everyone was resting under a large rock, they saw a woodcutter coming from afar. When the woodcutter saw someone, he came over to talk. This man was Wang Yinsheng, in his thirties, who made a living by chopping wood. His ancestors had lived at the foot of Mount Hua for generations. Getting to know this honest and brave man and obtaining his assistance was a prerequisite for our victory in cleverly capturing the North Peak of Mount Hua.

  (II)
　　To complete the scouting task, it was impossible without someone familiar with the mountain roads. Liu Jiyao then regarded Wang Yinsheng as an object of cultivation.

　　He stayed at Wang Yinsheng's house for ten days, helping his family chop wood and fetch water every day. During the day, he went up the mountain with Wang Yinsheng, and at night, they slept in the same bed. Liu Jiyao publicized our army's policies to Wang Yinsheng, explaining that the Liberation Army was the people's army, fighting the Kuomintang reactionaries, avenging the people, and many other reasons. The scouts chopped wood, transported grain, and cooked meals themselves, and cut down trees to build shelters for sleeping. Their actions greatly moved Wang Yinsheng's mother and son.

　　Wang Yinsheng said: I have also suffered under the Kuomintang Sixth Security Brigade. They conscripted me, and my father was beaten to death by them because they robbed his firewood without paying and added insults to injury. You are fighting for the people, and I want to avenge my father. Wang Yinsheng was willing to lead the way. He had climbed the North Peak once eight years ago from this route.

　　Liu Jiyao and Wang Yinsheng went to see the terrain. Wang said, "Don't we have few people?" Liu said, "One can be as good as ten."

  (III)
　　On the morning of June 14th, the Ludong General Detachment ordered Comrade Liu Jiyao to complete the scouting task. After eating, they set off, bringing ropes, bamboo poles, hooks, and weapons on their backs, along with Wang Yinsheng, a total of eight people. Going into Orangutan Gully and heading east for two miles, they arrived at "Tianjing" (Heavenly Well), a fifteen or sixteen-zhang deep stone cave that was straight up and down, and one had to go through here to get up the mountain. Yinsheng said: I have decades of climbing skills, let me go first. He was truly like an experienced old tiger who had roamed the mountains and forests, leading a group of little tigers to cross mountains and ridges. He took the rope and slowly climbed, using the support of his arms and legs. After he reached the top of "Tianjing," he tied one end of the rope to a large rock and let the other end hang down along the mouth of the cave. Everyone grabbed the rope and climbed up one by one. After walking fifty meters, they rounded a stone cliff and had to hold tightly to the stone crevices to pass. After passing the stone cliff, there was another dangerous place ahead, called "Hua Shi Ban" (Slippery Stone Slab). Wang Yinsheng tied the rope to a tree and first slid down the rope. He stood firmly, holding the rope tightly with one hand and extending the other to block, reminding everyone to come down carefully. Because if one was not careful or slid too fast and could not stop, one would fall into the abyss and be crushed to pieces.

　　After passing "Hua Shi Ban," they arrived at "Xie Da Mu" (Slanting Log), which was the most difficult place to pass. There was a mountain depression more than a zhang wide between two mountains, with only a finger's width that one could follow. Originally, there was a log, but it had rotted and fallen off the mountain sometime in the past. Everyone was very worried. What should they do? Suddenly, Liu Jiyao shouted, "I've got it, I've got it! There are some kudzu vines growing on the mountain over there. Hook them with hooks, grab the kudzu vines, and one person can get across. Then, chop down a pine tree and slant it across, and it's done!" Of course, this task was still for Wang Yinsheng.

　　By the time they had passed "Qinglong Bei" (Azure Dragon's Back) and reached the gap opposite the North Peak, it was almost dark. From here, they could see the gate of the North Peak temple. Through the telescope, they could see a sentry in front of the temple and another sentry on the top of the hat behind the temple.

　　Liu Jiyao thought: If we could sneak up to the top of the mountain behind the temple and strike the enemy with a fierce attack from a high position, catching them off guard, we would definitely win. The North Peak temple had four stories, two steles in front of the gate, and iron chains around it. It was estimated that there were at most forty or fifty enemies living here. They divided into four groups to advance. The mountain was steep, the road was slippery, and it was dark and windy. By the time they descended to the East Peak, it was late at night. Their hands were injured, their legs were bruised, and the soles of their shoes were worn out, exposing their feet. But they finally climbed to the front of the temple. There was a deer fence blocking the way. Liu Jiyao observed it and found that the deer fence was built on trees and could be passed under. The wind was howling through the trees and rocks, making it difficult to hear any other sounds. Wang Yinsheng wrapped his head in a cloth shirt and crawled under the deer fence. With all his strength, he lifted the deer fence. Everyone then crawled through together. They passed through three deer fences in this way. Liu Jiyao and another person stood guard outside, while the other six went inside to eliminate the enemy. Just as Liu Jiyao was about to step forward, he saw the enemy sentry get up. He held his submachine gun, about to fire, but the sentry stretched and went back into the temple. Liu Jiyao followed him into the temple. The sentry went to the east room to call someone to relieve him, saying that it was windy and cold today. The sound of the enemy turning over in bed and the shadows of people lighting cigarettes were clearly heard and seen. The snoring of the enemy in the west room was also very loud. By this time, everyone had arrived in the courtyard. Liu Jiyao kicked open the door and fired a burst of bullets. The enemy was so frightened that they knelt down, dropping their water pipes and guns on the ground.

　　Liu Jiyao ordered them to clap their hands and slap their buttocks as they walked out. The enemy walked out of the room bare-bellied, clapping their hands and slapping their buttocks. They captured a total of eleven enemies. The enemy's battalion commander and a communications soldier escaped into a cave. They didn't get away. After being hungry for two days and two nights, they tried to go down the way we came up, but they didn't have the courage. On the third day, they were still captured by us. They said: Did you fly up the mountain?

　　The clever capture of the North Peak was like a knife cutting the enemy in half, severing their connection between the top and the bottom, making it impossible for them to coordinate. The bravery and resourcefulness of these eight comrades subdued the enemy. More than a hundred bandits in places like Monkey Cave, Fisherman God Cave, and Canglong Ridge surrendered one after another. Thus, Mount Hua was completely liberated.

　　奇取华山北峰的特等战斗英雄刘吉尧
    李犁
    一九四九年六月十四日，人民解放军某部参谋刘吉尧同志，率领侦察员六人在樵夫王银生帮助下，攀登悬崖峭壁，排除千难万险，如神兵天降，于敌人不知不觉间突入敌阵，奇取了华山北峰，消灭了国民党陕西保六旅韩子佩部匪徒，拔除了华北的野战大军西进路上的障碍，使我军顺利的沿陇海路向西挺进，迅速的投入解放西北的伟大战斗。这是一个奇迹，这种奇迹，只有毛主席和朱总司令领导下的中国人民解放军才能创造出来。
  （一）
    华阴解放以后，国民党保六旅韩子佩匪部逃到华山上去了。他们盘据在那里，胡作非为，强奸道姑，砍伐林木，破坏我国西岳名胜；并且威胁着从华阴到潼关的这一段铁路通车的安全。大荔分区命令我路东总队解放华山，巩固交通。路东总队把侦察上山道路的任务，就交给了刘吉尧。
    刘吉尧带了十个侦察员，在六月一日到了华山山下的黄甫峪口。在这里侦察了四天，没有一点结果。老百姓说：上山的正路只有一条，就是这条正路上，也还要过“独木桥”、“千尺窗”、“鹞子翻身”、“老君立沟”等许多险要的地方。山有四十里高，路窄、风大，遇到瘴气，就是鸟雀也难展翅。
    后来好容易从一个七十多岁的老汉口里打听出一个线索，老汉说：听人传言，从黄甫峪口进去向南走四十里到华山山南，有一条猩猩沟可以上山，可是那里没有路，都是陡立的石崖。刘吉尧同志决定带大家再去猩猩沟侦察，非找到上山的路径不可，那怕有一万个困难。
    去猩猩沟的路，两旁大山耸立云霄，山上林木遮天蔽日，四十里路不见一家人家。走了一天，才出了川，这口儿的南边有一个小村叫两岔口。大家正在大石下休息，就见远远来了一个樵夫，那樵夫看见有人，便走来攀谈。这人叫王银生，三十多岁，打柴为业，祖辈就住在华山山下。认识了这个忠厚勇敢的人，得到了他的援助，我们奇取华山北峰的胜利，就取得了先决条件。
  （二）
    要完成侦察任务，没有一个熟悉山路的人是不行的。刘吉尧便把王银生当做一个培养的对象。
    在王银生家住了十天，天天帮他家打柴、汲水，白天和王银生一起上山，晚间睡在一个床上。刘吉尧向王银生宣传我军的政策，宣传解放军是人民的军队，打国民党反动派，为人民报仇等等许多道理。侦察员们自己打柴运粮作饭，砍树架棚睡眠。他们的行动大大感动了王银生母子。
    王银生说：我也受过国民党保六旅的气，被他们抓过丁，父亲就是因为他们抢了柴不给钱，连打加骂给气死的。你们为了老百姓作战，我也要为父亲报仇。王银生愿意带路。八年前他曾从这里上过一次北峰。
    刘吉尧和王银生去看地形，王说：“我们人不少吗？”刘说：“以一当十。”
  （三）
    六月十四日早上，路东总队命令刘吉尧同志完成侦察任务。吃过饭，他们就出发，带了绳子、竹竿、钩子，背好武器，连王银生一起一共八个人。进猩猩沟向东走二里多路，就到了“天井”，这是一个直上直下的十五六丈深的石洞，非经这里不得上山。银生说：我有几十年的爬山功夫，让我先上。他真像一只走遍山林、经验丰富的老老虎，引着一群小虎子翻山越岭。他带上绳子，用两臂和两腿的支撑力，慢慢攀登。他上了“天井”以后，把绳子一头拴在大石上，一头就顺着洞口垂下来。大家抓住绳子一个个爬上去。走了五十米达，绕过一个石崖，手须要紧扣住石缝才能爬过。过了石崖，前面又有一个险要的去处，叫作“滑石板”。王银生把绳拴在树上，首先顺绳滑下去。他站定了脚，一手扯紧绳子，一手伸出遮拦，让大家留神下来。因为一不小心或滑得太快收不住步时，就会掉在万丈深涧里，跌个粉身碎骨。
    过了“滑石板”就到了“斜搭木”，这是最难通过的一个地方了。两个山之间有丈多宽的一个山洼，当中只有一指的地方可以沿着过去，原来有一条木头，早不知什么年月朽烂而掉下山去了。大家非常发愁，这可怎么办呢？忽然刘吉尧喊道：“有了，有了。那边山上长着一些葛藤，用钩子钩住，抓住葛藤过去一个人，再砍倒一棵松树，斜搭过来就成了。”当然这个任务，还是王银生的。
    等过了“青龙背”到北峰对面的豁口时，天已快黑。从这里可以望见北峰的庙门，从望远镜里看见庙前有一个哨兵，庙后顶帽上也有一个哨兵。
    刘吉尧想：假使能摸到庙后的山顶上，居高临下，给敌人个猛打猛冲，出其不意，定能取胜。北峰庙有四层楼，门前有两座兆碑，四周有铁炼围绕。估计在这里住的敌人，至多四五十个。他们分成了四个小组前进。山陡路滑，天黑、风大，下得东峰，已是夜深。手碰坏了，腿摔伤了，鞋底也磨的露了脚了。但是，他们终于爬到庙前了。前面有一道鹿砦挡路。刘吉尧观察了一下，发现鹿砦是架在树上的，底下可以通过。风刮得树和石头都呜呜地响，就是有点声音也不易听到。王银生用布衫把头包住，钻到鹿砦底下，用了全身力气一挺，便把鹿砦架起来了。大家就一齐钻了过去。他们这样通过了三道鹿砦。刘吉尧和另一个人在外面监视敌人，其他六个人进去消灭敌人。刘吉尧刚要上前，就见敌人哨兵起来，他扣着冲锋机枪，刚要开火，可是那哨兵却伸了个懒腰进庙去了。刘吉尧跟着也进了庙。哨兵去东屋叫人换岗，说今儿风大天冷。床上敌人翻身的声音，擦火吸烟的影子听得看得一清二楚。西屋敌人的鼾声也打得很响。这时大家都到了院里，刘吉尧一脚踢开屋门，接着就打了一梭子弹，敌人吓得跪下，水烟袋，枪都摔在地下。
    刘吉尧命令他们拍着手，拍着屁股走出去，敌人就赤着肚子，劈劈拍拍的走出屋子，一共捉了十一个敌人。敌人的营长和一个通讯员钻地洞逃了。他们没能走脱，饿了两天两夜，想从我们上来的路上下去，可是又没这个胆量，第三天还是被我们捉住了，他们说：你们是飞上山来的吗？
    奇取了北峰，就像拦腰一刀，斩断了敌人上下的联系使他们首尾不能相顾。这八个同志的神勇和机智压服了敌人，猴儿洞、渔神洞、仓龙岭等地的一百多匪徒相继投降，于是华山全部解放。
