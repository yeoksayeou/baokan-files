	The students of the Fourth Adult Night School in the Third District of Beijing actively participated in collecting signatures for peace. Within four days, from August 22nd to 25th, the 120 students of the school collected over 23,400 signatures. Student Li Wenzhi mobilized a full 1,000 people to sign. Student Fan Debao, because he had to ride a tricycle during the day, could not go out with everyone to collect signatures, so he took paper and asked the passengers riding in his tricycle to sign. Currently, five adult night schools in the Third District have collected over 30,000 signatures. (Third District Correspondence Group)
	The peace signature campaign has been widely launched in urban and rural areas of Dongguang County, Shandong Province. In 292 villages, 77,025 people have signed. Through publicity during the signing process, the masses' awareness has been greatly improved, and they have gained a deeper understanding of the signature campaign. Liu Yucheng, a farmer from Liu Dao Village, said after signing: "Just signing is not enough, we must actually do it. I guarantee to select seeds first." Chen Lianting, a militia member from Chen Dong Village, in order to express his sincere support for peace, traveled sixty miles to Dongguang, carved a seal, and brought it back to stamp the signature book.
	Li Yingkui, a cook at the government of Xihe County, Gansu Province, said excitedly during the signing: "Why shouldn't I sign? The bandit Chiang grabbed me and made me a soldier for more than ten years. I didn't return home until liberation. When I got home, I had nothing left. My wife was abducted, and I didn't even have any children left. If it weren't for the government taking care of me, I wouldn't even have food to eat. Do you think I would want to fight again? But if the devils come to fight, I'm not afraid, I will fight them to the end!"
	Jiang Yuanzhen, a 73-year-old woman from Xihe County, Gansu Province, cried to the masses at the signing site. She said: "I only had one son, and the conscience-selling Zhang Baochang forcibly drafted him into the army a long time ago. It's been eight or nine years with no news. His wife left with someone else, and I don't even have a grandson. Whose fault is this? Isn't it the bad idea of that old bald thief Chiang Kai-shek? Now I am signing, I want peace. Please also send a message to Chairman Mao, don't let that bad egg Chiang Kai-shek escape."
	Ren Shangyuan, a farmer from Xihe County, said: "I have lived for more than sixty years, and I never knew what peace was. Since liberation, there has been no conscription and no fighting. Now I understand that only the liberated areas under the leadership of our Communist Party have true peace!" (Lei Jin)
	Lin Kaihua, a Baochang (local leader) in Lingshan Township, Qiongshan County, Hainan District, often forgot to eat in order to mobilize the masses to participate in the peace signature campaign. The township head asked him to eat first, but he said: "Eating is my personal matter, it doesn't matter. Supporting the peace movement is a major event. I can't do this work well, I always feel uneasy."
	Chen Chunqi, a farmer from Daling Township, Qiongshan County, said: "The Japanese devils' massacre and oppression of the people in Hainan makes my teeth itch just thinking about it. Now the Japanese devils have been driven away by us, and the American devils want to oppress us again. We must give them a lesson. Come on, let's sign our names." (Wang Shouming)

　　中国保卫世界和平线上
    北京市内三区第四成人夜校学员，在征集和平签名的过程中，表现十分积极。八月二十二日至二十五日的四天内，该校一百二十名学员共征集了二万三千四百余人签名。学生李文志一个人即发动了整整一千人签名。学生范德宝因为白天要蹬三轮，不能随大家出去征集签名，就拿纸请坐车的客人签名。现内三区五个成人夜校已征集了三万余人签名。（三区通讯组）
    和平签名运动在山东东光县城乡广泛展开，在二百九十二个村子里已有七万七千零二十五人签了名。签名时通过宣传，群众的觉悟大大提高。对签名运动更有了深刻的认识。刘道庄农民刘玉成签完名说：“光签个名还是不够，得实际去干，我保证先选种去”。陈董庄民兵陈连亭在签名时为了表示衷心拥护和平，特不远六十里跑到东光，刻了一个图章，拿回来在签名册上盖了章。
    甘肃西和县政府的炊事员李应奎同志在签名时非常激动地说：“我为什么不签名呢？蒋贼把我抓去当了十几年兵，直到解放了才回到家，回家一看什么也没有了，老婆被人拐走了，两个孩子也没留下一个，要不是政府照料我，连饭也吃不上，难道我还愿意再打仗？不过，那个鬼子要来打，我也不怕，我要和它拚到底！”
    甘肃西和县七十三岁的姜原真在签名处向群众哭诉，她说：“我只有一个儿子，老早给卖良心的张保长拉了壮丁，一去八九年毫无音信，媳妇跟人走了，孙子也没留下一个，这是谁的罪过？还不是那蒋介石老秃贼的坏主意？现在我签名，我要和平，再请给毛主席带个信，不要把那蒋介石坏蛋放跑了。”
    西和县农民任尚元说：“我活了六十多岁，从来就不知道什么是和平，解放了一直没有要过兵没有打过仗，这我才明白了，只有咱们共产党领导下的解放区才真有和平呢！”    （雷进）
    林开华是海南区琼山县灵山乡的一个保长，为了发动群众参加和平签名常常连饭都忘记了吃，乡长叫他先吃饭，他说：“吃饭是我个人的事，不要紧，拥护和平运动是大事，不能做好这工作我总是放不下心的。”
    琼山县大林乡农民陈春奇说：“日本鬼子在咱们海南时的屠杀和压迫人民的暴行，想起来，就令人咬牙，现在日本鬼子被我们打跑了，美国鬼子又要来压迫我们，我们一定要给它一个颜色看，来吧，咱们签上名。”（王守明）
