Screening of the Film "The Victory of the Chinese People"
    Ministry of Finance Issues Notice Exempting Entertainment Tax

The news that the film "The Victory of the Chinese People" would be screened in fifteen major cities including Beijing and Tianjin from the 29th was reported in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. Given the film's great political and educational significance, and in order to celebrate the first National Day of the People's Republic of China and to allow the broad masses of people to have the opportunity to see the film, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government has specifically telegraphed local tax bureaus instructing them to exempt viewers from entertainment tax during the film's screening. It is stipulated that the tax exemption must be genuinely deducted from the original ticket price in order to reduce the burden on viewers.
