　　Rushes to Make Gifts Before National Day
　　[This newspaper dispatch] Li Jinquan, a special-grade technician at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and a worker representative from Beijing attending the National Model Worker Representative Conference, reported to this newspaper his production plan to greet National Day. He said: "The anniversary of the founding of the nation is fast approaching. Worker brothers from all over the country have expressed their intention to greet this festival with practical actions. I deeply feel that my contribution to the country is too small, so I decided to use waste welding rods to produce two tons of welding rods before October 1st. Furthermore, I am determined to continue research to further improve the quality of mild steel welding rods and to successfully develop welding rods for welding aluminum and welding copper as a gift to celebrate National Day." Finally, he expressed his warm respect to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

　　劳模代表李金泉
    国庆日前赶制礼物
    【本报讯】北京市出席全国劳模代表会议的工人代表、石景山钢铁厂特等技工李金泉，向本报报告了他迎接国庆日的生产计划。他说：“开国周年纪念眼看就到了。全国各地的工人弟兄都纷纷表示以实际的行动来迎接这个节日，我深深感到自己对国家的贡献太小，所以决定在十月一日以前利用废焊条作出两吨焊条来。并且我还决心继续研究，使软钢焊条质量继续提高，并把焊铝、焊铜的焊条早日研究成功，作为献给国庆的礼物。”最后，他对毛主席和共产党致以热烈的敬意。
