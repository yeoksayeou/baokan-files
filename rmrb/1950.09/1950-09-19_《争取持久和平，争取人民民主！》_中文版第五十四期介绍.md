Xinhua News Agency, 18th: "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" - Introduction to the Chinese Edition, Issue 54 (Total Issue 93) has been published.

The editorial of this issue, entitled "The Policies of Warmongers and the Situation of the Working People in Capitalist Countries," points out that due to the war-mongering policies implemented by the American and British imperialist gangs, and their efforts to place the burden of all war expenses on the working class, the exploitation and plunder of the working people has been intensified. The editorial states: This is the gangster-like law of imperialism: the ruling class always prepares for war adventures at the expense of the vital interests of the broad masses of the people. The editorial points out that the economic militarization of the United States and the countries of the Marshall Plan has broken the record of Hitler's Germany in preparing for World War II. Seventy percent of the United States' regular national budget is directly or indirectly used for war preparations. The British government has announced that it will increase military spending by 25 percent. The French government plans to increase military spending to 1.2 trillion francs. This is the despicable and predatory policy pursued by American imperialism and its satellite countries, and it is also a policy of lowering the living standards of the working class. The editorial says that Truman's congressional message openly launched a large-scale attack on the living standards of the American working people. He suggested greatly increasing taxes, called for intensified work, and signaled the imminent restriction of the democratic rights enjoyed by the people. The government and industrial tycoons have jointly deprived workers of the right to strike, and the situation of farmers is also deteriorating. According to statistics, on the eve of the United States' launch of aggression against Korea, there were 45 million fully or partially unemployed people in the capitalist world. At the beginning of this year, bourgeois official statistics showed that the prices of daily necessities in 23 capitalist countries had increased. The editorial points out that, on the contrary, according to official figures, the profits of large American companies this year will be about 17 percent higher than in 1949. The editorial says that while the working people are forced to become increasingly impoverished and bankrupt, the class struggle within the capitalist camp has become more acute. Last year, there were 3,606 strikes in the United States involving more than three million people. The editorial continues, the situation in capitalist countries is completely different from the peace policy and the policy of improving the material well-being of the broad masses of the people implemented by the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. By the end of last year, the Soviet Union's production had exceeded the pre-World War II level of 1940 by 53 percent. The industrial production of the People's Democratic countries has also grown spectacularly, and unemployment has been completely eliminated. The editorial says that the working class in various countries, under the leadership of the Communist Party, is uniting with other people who are bearing the increasing burden due to militarism, and is determined to thwart the policy of the imperialist aggressors to launch a new war. The struggle of the working people for a higher standard of living is closely linked to the movement against war and to stop the American aggression against Korea. This strengthening of the unity of the working class and all the working people of capitalist countries in their heroic struggle, the vigorous development of the national liberation movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and the signing of the Stockholm Peace Appeal by millions of people to oppose war, all truly guarantee that the criminal plans of the imperialist governments will be defeated.

This issue publishes a part of the report "Striving for Peace and the Unity of the Working Class" made by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, to the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain on July 18, 1950. In the article, Pollitt pointed out that the most urgent task facing the Communist Party is: to strive for the unity of the working class and all democratic and peace-loving people. The center of the current world situation, and also the center of the thoughts of millions of working people, is most importantly to defend peace. Therefore, the Communist Party of Great Britain should strive for millions of British citizens to defend world peace, regardless of their political, economic or religious relations. Based on this policy, the Communist Party of Great Britain should expose and oppose the war policy pursued by the Conservative Party and the Labour Party in following American imperialism.

In addition, this issue publishes "The Struggle of the French Communist Party to Defend Peace" written by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party, "The Canadian Working People Oppose Wall Street's Interference in Korea" written by Leslie Morris, Secretary of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, and "The Cuban People's Struggle Against War and for Democratic Freedom" written by Juan Marinello, General Secretary of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba. The above-mentioned articles all illustrate the efforts of the working people in these countries to strive for peace, oppose war, and especially oppose this American imperialist aggression against Korea. The people of France and Canada have endorsed the Stockholm Peace Appeal to express their magnificent strength. The Cuban people are struggling to oppose turning Cuba into an American tool in this war.

This issue also publishes the important article "The Task of Strengthening the German Communist Party Ideologically and Politically" by Max Reimann, Chairman of the German Communist Party, and the article "The Sixth Anniversary of Romania's Liberation" written by Gheorghe Apostol, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party.

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》
    ——中文版第五十四期介绍
    【新华社十八日讯】《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第五十四期（总第九十三期）已经出版。
    该刊本期以“战争贩子的政策及资本主义国家的劳动人民的情况”为题的社论指出：由于美英帝国主义匪帮所执行的发动战争的政策，由于他们力图把全部战争费用的负担都加在工人阶级的身上，对劳动人民大众的剥削与掠夺已经加强。社论称：这就是帝国主义强盗性的法律：统治阶级总是牺牲了广大人民群众的重要利益来准备战争的冒险。社论指出，美国及马歇尔计划的国家的经济之备战化已打破了希特勒德国准备第二次世界大战的纪录。美国国家经常预算的百分之七十是直接或间接用在备战上。英国政府已宣布行将增加备战费百分之二十五。法国政府打算把军费增加到一万二千亿法郎。这就是美国帝国主义及其卫星国家所奉行的卑鄙及掠夺的政策，也就是降低工人阶级生活水平的政策。社论说：杜鲁门国会咨文中公开向美国劳动人民的生活水平作大规模的进攻。他建议把税额大大增加，号召加紧工作，并且发出即将限制人民所享受的民主权利的信号。政府和工业大亨已联合剥夺工人的罢工权，农民的状况也每况愈下。据统计，资本主义世界在美国向朝鲜发动侵略的前夕，共有四千五百万全部或部分的失业者。今年年初资产阶级官方的统计，二十三个资本主义国家的日常必需品的价格已见增加。社论指出：与此相反的是，根据官方数字，今年美国大公司的利润将比一九四九年约高出百分之十七。社论说：与劳动人民被迫日益贫穷破产同时，资本主义营垒内的阶级斗争已更形尖锐。去年美国有牵涉三百万人以上的三千六百零六次罢工。社论继称，与资本主义国家的情况迥然不同的则是苏联及人民民主国家所执行的和平政策及改善广大人民群众物质地位的政策。苏联的生产至去年底为止已超过第二次大战前一九四○年水平的百分之五十三。人民民主国家的工业生产也辉煌增长，并完全消灭了失业现象。社论说：各国工人阶级在共产党领导下，正与其他因为黩武主义而负担日益增加的人民联合起来，决心挫败帝国主义侵略者发动新战争的政策。劳动人民为更高的生活水平而进行的斗争，是与反对战争及停止美国侵略朝鲜的运动紧密连系的。这个工人阶级及所有资本主义国家的劳动人民在英勇斗争中团结的加强，殖民地及半殖民地国家民族解放运动的有力发展，千万人民在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名以反对战争，都真实地保证了帝国主义的政府的罪恶计划必被击败。
    本期刊登了英国共产党总书记波立特在一九五○年七月十八日对英国共产党执行委员会报告的一部分“争取和平和工人阶级的团结”，波立特在文中指出了摆在共产党面前的最急迫的任务是：努力争取工人阶级和所有民主与爱好和平的人民的团结。现在世界局势的中心，也是千百万劳动人民的思想的中心，最重要的是保卫和平。因此英国共产党应该争取千百万英国公民去保卫世界和平，不问他们的政治、经济或宗教的关系如何。基于这个政策，英国共产党应该揭露和反对保守党和工党所实行的跟着美国帝国主义走的战争政策。
    另外，本期刊登了法国共产党书记杜克洛写的“法国共产党保卫和平的斗争”，加拿大劳工进步党书记瑞尔逊写的“加拿大劳动人民反对华尔街干涉朝鲜”及古巴人民社会党总书记罗加写的“古巴人民为反对战争和争取民主自由而斗争”的论文。上述论文都说明了这些国家的劳动人民为争取和平、反对战争，特别反对这次美帝国主义的侵略朝鲜而努力。法国和加拿大的人民拥护斯德哥尔摩和平宣言表示自己的宏伟的力量。古巴人民正进行斗争反对将古巴变成这一战争中的美国工具。
    本期还刊登了德国共产党主席雷曼的重要论文“从思想——政治上加强德国共产党的任务”，以及罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记波克写的“罗马尼亚解放六周年”的论文。
