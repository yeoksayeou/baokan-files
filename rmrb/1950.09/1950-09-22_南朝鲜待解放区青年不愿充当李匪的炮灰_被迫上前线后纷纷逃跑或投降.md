Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 21st: According to the Korean Central News Agency: The testimonies of some puppet soldiers who surrendered to the People's Army reflect that the youth in the unliberated areas of South Korea are unwilling to serve as cannon fodder for the remaining bandit gang of Syngman Rhee. After being forced to the front lines, they flee or surrender en masse. Huang Taijia, a second-class private belonging to the Sixth Division of the puppet army who surrendered in the Palgongsan area north of Daegu, is a farmer from Gupo County, Gyeongsangnam-do. On the evening of August 12th, he was seized and taken to Busan to participate in a so-called "Youth Training Class," along with forty-three other young men. Without any “training classes”, they were sent to the Daegu puppet National Defense Force Headquarters on the 13th without even having breakfast. Jin Huashu is a twenty-one-year-old second-class private of the puppet army who surrendered in Uiseong and is a student at Daegu Agricultural School. He was seized at the end of July to be a soldier, and after five days of training, he was sent to the front line. Jin Huashu said: "On August 3rd, we two hundred and fifty recruits drove from Daegu to Uiseong. When we arrived at the front line, the regiment was already in complete disarray. The platoon leader of the third platoon and all the officers and soldiers below him were missing. Eighteen people from the first and second platoons had also run away. We were trembling from the sound of the People's Army's approaching artillery fire, and we didn't bother to aim in the trenches, just fired our guns outwards randomly. On the morning of August 7th, the People's Army attacked. The officers either died or ran away. We who surrendered were fortunate not to be their scapegoats!"

　　南朝鲜待解放区青年不愿充当李匪的炮灰
    被迫上前线后纷纷逃跑或投降
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：向人民军投降的一些伪军士兵的谈话，反映出南朝鲜待解放区青年不愿为李承晚残余匪帮充当炮灰，当他们被强迫驱上前线以后，即行纷纷逃跑或投降。在大邱以北八公山地区投降的伪军第六师团所属二等兵黄太甲，是庆尚南道龟浦郡的农民。他在八月十二日晚上被抓去釜山参加所谓“青年讲习班”，和他同时被抓的还有四十三个青年。他们不用说上“讲习班”，十三日连早饭也没有吃就被押送到大邱伪国防军本部去了。金化洙是在义城投降的伪军二等兵，二十一岁，是大邱农业学校的学生。他于七月底被抓去当兵，受了五天训练之后，就被送上前线。金化洙说：“八月三日，我们二百五十名新兵从大邱开到义城，到前线的时候，联队已经紊乱得不成样子。第三排排长以下全体官兵都不知去向。第一、二两排中也跑掉了十八名。我们被人民军迫近的炮声震得发抖，在战壕里面顾不得瞄准，只把枪口朝外乱射。八月七日早晨，人民军攻上来了，长官们不是死掉、就是跑掉。我们投降的一伙，万幸没有做他们的替死鬼！”
