Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th. In the two or three years since the completion of land reform in Northeast China's rural areas, under the leadership of the People's Government, peasants' enthusiasm for production has soared, cultivated land area and output have increased year by year, and as a result, farmers' living standards have also continuously improved.

　　Most Poor and Middle Peasants Rise Up; Draught Animals and Farm Implements Increase Rapidly

According to a survey conducted last winter in twenty-one villages (belonging to sixteen counties) in Heilongjiang Province, among the tenant farmers who accounted for half of the rural households before land reform, 50.6 percent have now risen to become middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants; among the original poor peasants, with the exception of 1 percent who declined, 57 percent have risen; and 17.1 percent of the original middle peasants have also risen. Among the total number of households in the countryside, 62.7 percent have risen since land reform. The proportion of middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants in the countryside has increased from 16 percent before land reform to 53.8 percent. According to a survey of fifteen villages (belonging to eight counties) in Liaodong Province, where land reform was completed slightly later, the number of middle peasants has increased from 939 households to 2,748 households, almost tripling.

In the past two years, the increase in draught animals and farm implements in the rural areas of Northeast China has been particularly rapid. According to incomplete statistics from Liaodong Province last year alone, more than 174,000 draught animals were added. A survey of eight villages in the four counties of Zhuanghe, etc., shows that farmers now have more than twice as many draught animals as before land reform, and large carts have also increased by 88 percent. Songjiang Province added more than 27,000 draught animals last year. In Bao'an Village, Jixian County, every family added a horse after land reform. In Hulan County, more than 2,400 large carts have been added in the past two years. Currently, the rubber tires produced by state-owned and private rubber factories in Northeast China have found a market in the countryside (large carts used by Northeast farmers are all rubber-wheeled). Tin buckets for drawing water have also begun to be welcomed in the countryside.

　　Poor Tenant Farmers Escape Poverty; Able to Change into New Clothes Every Season

Before land reform, most poor tenant farmers in Northeast China could only wear burlap sacks to keep warm in winter, but many people could not take off their tattered cotton-padded coats that they had worn for more than a decade even in summer. Now, the vast majority can change into new clothes in a timely manner every season. In Xiushui District, Yushu County, Jilin Province, each person bought an average of seventeen chi of cloth last year. In Guoyu Village, Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, each person bought an average of more than twenty-eight chi of cloth last year. In Taizigou Village, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, farmers bought four times as much cloth last year as before land reform. Cui Chengcai, a farmer in Bao'an Village, Jixian County, Songjiang Province, who had been a hired laborer for twelve years, used to have only one pair of pants that he and his wife took turns wearing. Last year alone, his wife made four new large cloth shirts. His entire family bought three hundred chi of cloth last year. Zhang Baochi, a hired laborer in Zhongxin Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, who had been a hired laborer for twelve years, used to wear the same clothes regardless of the season, stuffing them with cotton in winter and taking out the cotton in summer. But last year, his entire family wore new cotton-padded clothes inside and out. Yu Deshui, an old hired laborer who had been a farmhand for three generations, was so poor before land reform that he could not even produce a jar to repay debts. Now, his own bedding alone consists of a blanket, a mattress, and two quilts.

In addition to cotton cloth and cotton, Northeast farmers' demand for other daily-use industrial products has also increased. In the first quarter of this year alone, the Songjiang Provincial Department Store sold 213,000 pairs of rubber shoes to the countryside, which is equal to 80 percent of the total sales last year. The sales of towels and socks in the first quarter of this year were also equal to one-half of the total sales for the entire year last year.

　　Every Household Has Surplus Grain; Farmers' Purchasing Power Increases

Rice and white flour, which were almost inaccessible to farmers during the puppet Manchukuo regime, are now staple foods for festivals in the countryside. In Guanshui District, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, cooperatives sold more than thirty bags of white flour in less than two months last winter. Farmers in Shuanghe Village in the county purchased an average of 500,000 yuan (Northeast currency) worth of New Year's goods from the cooperative per household.

All of this shows that the actual purchasing power of Northeast farmers has greatly increased. This year, the total purchasing power of farmers in Northeast China is equivalent to more than 5.6 million tons of grain. Their purchasing power comes from selling large quantities of surplus grain and sideline products. In the two months of October and November last year, Heilongjiang Province purchased surplus grain from farmers equal to the total grain purchase for the entire year of 1947. The purchase of farmers' sideline products in two and a half months last winter also reached more than 892 billion yuan. This year, the province expects that farmers' income from agricultural and sideline production will make the total rural purchasing power equivalent to more than 2.8 million tons of grain. Before land reform in 1946, farmers in Songjiang Province only sold 180,000 tons of surplus grain. In the first half of this year alone, state-owned commercial enterprises purchased 340,000 tons, and it is estimated that there are still more than 60,000 tons of surplus grain in the countryside waiting to be sold. As a result of agricultural production last year in Jilin Province, after deducting public grain and what is needed for living and production, the 5.4 million rural people had an average surplus of more than 250 jin of grain per person. The increase in surplus grain and the increase in purchasing power of Northeast farmers have further accelerated the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

　　New Houses Are Being Built Everywhere; The Dilapidated Appearance of Villages Is Being Changed

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th. In the past two years, farmers in the Northeast region, which has completed land reform, have been building new houses one after another, and many dilapidated villages have taken on a new look. According to statistics from more than 5,400 villages in Liaodong Province, more than 80,000 new houses have been added in the past two years, and almost every village has new houses. In Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province alone, farmers built more than 8,200 new houses. In Heilongjiang District, Yushu County, Jilin Province, more than 1,500 new houses were built this spring alone. These new houses were built on the ruins of dilapidated houses before land reform. Now, in most villages, rows of flat-roofed houses with bright windows and clean houses are neatly arranged. With more housing, farmers have separated livestock pens from residences. Because grain income is increasing year by year, many farmers are also building granaries. Many villages are now much larger than before. Qinggong Village in Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, used to have two streets, now it has three streets, like a newly emerging town.

Before land reform, there was a great shortage of housing for farmers in Northeast China, and the vast majority of houses belonged to landlords and rich peasants. Farmers could only barely rent a place to live at the cost of working for landlords. Many farmers were crammed into dilapidated small houses with several families. After land reform, they were allocated the landlords' surplus houses, plus the new houses built in the past two years, and many farmers have obtained more adequate housing. Zhang Fuyong, a farmer in Qinggong Village, Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, whose family had been without land or houses for three generations, had been forced to move seventeen times in twenty years by landlords before land reform. After land reform, Zhang Fuyong's family built three new houses. In Huzhu Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, before land reform, more than 20 people from four families, including the hired laborer Qian Baifu, lived together in a cramped space, with the stove placed next to the kang (heated brick bed). There was even a tragic incident in which a baby fell from the kang into the pot and was scalded to death. Now, the four families each have their own new houses with plenty of sunlight.

　　土地改革后农民生产热情高涨
    东北农村经济普遍上升
    耕地面积和粮食产量逐年增加  农民生活改善购买力大大提高
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北农村在完成土地改革后两三年来，在人民政府的领导下，农民生产热情高涨，耕地面积和产量年年增加，因此农民生活也不断上升。
    贫雇中农大部上升  耕畜农具迅速增加
    据去年冬天黑龙江省二十一个村（分属十六个县）的调查、土地改革以前占农村户数一半的雇农，其中现在已经上升为中农和富裕中农的占百分之五十点六；原来的贫农，除百分之一下降外，有百分之五十七上升；原来的中农也有百分之十七点一上升了。在农村全体户数中，土地改革后有百分之六十二点七的户数是上升的。现在中农和富裕中农在农村中的比例，已由土地改革以前的百分之十六上升到百分之五十三点八。另据土地改革完成稍晚的辽东省十五个村（分属八个县）的调查，中农已由九百三十九户增加为二千七百四十八户，几乎增加了两倍。
    这两年，东北农村的耕畜和农具的增加特别迅速。据去年一年辽东省的不完全统计，共增加耕畜十七万四千余头。庄河等四个县中八个村的调查，农民现有耕畜已较土地改革以前增加一倍多，大车也增加了百分之八十八。松江省耕畜去年增加了二万七千多匹。集贤县保安村在土地改革后每家都添了一匹马。呼兰县两年多来增加了二千四百多辆大车。现在东北各地公私营橡胶工厂出产的橡皮轮胎，已在农村中找到了销路（东北农民所用大车都是胶轮）。打水用的洋铁桶也开始在农村中受到欢迎。
    贫雇农摆脱贫困  都能按季换新衣
    土地改革以前东北大多数贫雇农冬天只能披着麻袋片御寒，可是，许多人却是到了夏天还脱不下因为穿了十几年而破烂不堪的大棉袄，现在绝大部分都能及时按季换上新衣了。吉林省榆树县秀水区去年每人平均买了十七尺布。黑龙江省讷河县国裕村去年每人平均买布二十八尺以上。辽东省宽甸县台子沟村，去年农民买的布比土地改革以前增加了四倍。松江省集贤县保安村农民崔成财在土地改革以前夫妻俩轮流换穿一条裤子，去年一年仅他老婆一人就做了四件新大布衫。他全家去年买了三百尺布。黑龙江省克山县众心村当了十二年雇农的张保池，以前穿衣不分冬夏，冬天塞上棉花，夏天掏出棉花。但到了去年，他全家都穿上了里外三新的棉衣。三辈子都当长工的老雇农于德水，土地改革前穷得连一口缸都拿出还债。现在仅他自己一个人的铺盖就是一床毯子，一床褥子和两条棉被。
    除棉布和棉花以外，东北农民对于其他日用工业品的需要也增加了。松江省百货公司仅在今年第一季度中向农村推销的胶皮鞋，即达二十一万三千双，等于去年推销总量的百分之八十。在今年第一季度中推销的毛巾和袜子也等于去年全年的二分之一。
    家家户户有余粮  农民购买力提高
    伪满统治时期几乎和农民绝缘的大米、白面，现在是农村中逢年过节时的食物。辽东省宽甸县灌水区合作社去冬不到两个月就销售了白面三十余袋。该县双河村农民平均每户向合作社办了五十万元（东北币，下同）的年货。
    所有这些说明了东北农民的实际购买力已经大大提高。今年全东北农民总的购买力约折合粮食五百六十余万吨。他们的购买力是由于他们出售了大批余粮和副业产品而取得的。黑龙江省去年十、十一两个月从农民手中所收购的余粮等于一九四七年全年的购粮总额。去冬两个半月收购农民副业产品亦达八千九百二十余亿元。该省今年预计农民从事农业与副业生产的收入，将使农村购买力总值合粮二百八十万吨以上。松江省农民在土地改革以前一九四六年仅出卖余粮十八万吨，今年上半年仅国营商业即收购了三十四万吨，估计农村尚有六万多吨余粮等待推销。吉林省去年一年农业生产的结果，除公粮和生活、生产所需外，五百四十万农村人口，平均每人余粮二百五十余斤。东北农民余粮增多，购买力提高，更加速了城乡物资的交流。
    到处修盖新房屋  残破村屯改旧观
    【新华社沈阳六日电】业已完成土地改革的东北地区的农民，两年来纷纷修盖新屋，许多残破的村屯已焕然一新。据辽东省五千四百余个农村统计：两年来新添的房舍达八万余间，几乎村村都有新房。松江省仅双城一县，农民就盖了新房八千二百余间。吉林省榆树县黑林子一个区，仅今春修了新房一千五百多间。这些新房子，是在土地改革前的破烂房屋的废墟上修起来的，现在，大部分村屯里，都有一幢幢明窗亮户的平顶房子整齐地排列着。住房多了，农民就把牲口圈和住宅分开了。因为粮食收入一年比一年多，农民修盖粮仓的也很多。现在许多村屯比过去大多了。松江省双城县庆功村原来是两条街道，现在是三条街，俨如一个新兴的市镇。
    土地改革以前，东北农民住房很缺乏，房屋绝大多数是地主和富农的。农民只能以给地主作工为代价，才勉强租得一席之地。农民们许多是好几家挤在一间破漏的小房里。经过土地改革分到了地主多余的房屋，加上这两年来新修的房屋，许多农民们已获得了较充裕的住宅。松江省双城县庆功村一家曾经三辈子没地没房子的农民张福永，土地改革以前二十年中曾被地主撵得搬过十七次家。土地改革后，张福永一家就盖了三间新房。黑龙江省克山县互助村，土地改革以前雇农钱白福等四家二十余人挤住在一起，锅灶按在炕边，曾经发生过婴儿从炕上跌落锅中惨被烫死的事。现在他们四家已各有自己的阳光充沛的新房。
