　　[This newspaper reported] The Central People's Government Committee Office and Government Administration Council directly subordinate units began streamlining and thrift inspections in early July, and concluded them in late August.

　　After receiving the Government Administration Council's methods for streamlining and thrift inspection in early July, the Central People's Government Committee Office and Government Administration Council directly subordinate units convened a mobilization meeting to carry out ideological mobilization. Responsible comrades from each unit formed four inspection groups, responsible for inspecting personnel establishment, expenditure, housing construction and allocation, transportation, and furniture storage. Each group made a detailed inspection plan and inspection outline. Party and Youth League branches took the initiative to cooperate. At the same time, the Study Committee arranged for the study of relevant documents on streamlining and thrift. Primarily based on Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee, everyone was called upon to truly understand the important significance of "substantial reduction in state institutional expenditures." Through seminars, discussions, criticism and self-criticism, the inspection of streamlining and thrift formed a heated movement, and a comprehensive inspection was subsequently launched. After inspection, the following problems were found:

　　Personnel establishments and organizations not suitable for business needs need to be adjusted.

　　(1) Inspection of streamlining: First, the personnel establishment for the first half of the year was studied. When the establishment was planned in the first half of the year, the organizations had just been established, work had not yet started, and the scope of work and responsibilities of some units were not very clear. Therefore, some of the establishments in the first half of the year were not suitable for business needs. Some units had fewer people than the planned number, but work was not difficult to support. For example, the Secretariat currently has 21 fewer people than the original establishment, but has completed its work tasks. Some units, such as the Confidential Office, the General Affairs Office, the Reference Room, and the Personnel Bureau, need to adjust their work organizations and increase their staff as their business scope increases and work continues to develop. Some units, such as the Budget Office, have not yet clearly defined their responsibilities and scope of business. Another problem with the establishment is that due to the small number of cadres, they concurrently hold positions, causing the relationship between administrative departments and enterprises to be unclear. For example, the Reception Office and its subordinate hotels, the Construction Section and the Construction Company, and the Transportation Section and the Automobile Repair Factory, have not clearly separated personnel, and the business of administration and enterprises has not been clearly divided. Based on the above situation, the following opinions on the establishment were put forward: In the future, when determining the establishment, the responsibilities and tasks of each unit must first be clarified, and it is not appropriate to make rough estimates that are too broad or too tight. The Personnel Bureau, the General Affairs Office, and the Confidential Office should all consider adjusting their organizational forms and internal organizations. The tasks of the Budget Office and its working relationship with the Ministry of Finance should be quickly and clearly stipulated. The institutions and personnel of enterprises and administrative units must be strictly separated.

　　Regarding the quality of staff and their work attitude: The inspection focused primarily on checking work attitude. In terms of the quality and work attitude of the staff, in addition to identifying a few unqualified personnel, the work attitude of most comrades was very honest and responsible. They obeyed organizational assignments and wholeheartedly wanted to do a good job. However, some staff members were not at ease with their work. For example, before December last year, 90% of the people in the Reception Office were not at ease with their work. After half a year of study and work inspection, it still accounts for 30%. One-third of the Personnel Bureau is not at ease with their work. There are three main reasons for uneasiness: First, the work and study systems of the agencies have not been well established, and the leadership has not paid enough attention to this aspect. Second, there are work and ideological problems of the cadres themselves. For example, some cadres have low cultural levels, and some are unfamiliar with the business. Although they are enthusiastic, they cannot do their job well, resulting in disappointment and uneasiness. Others have not had their job positions determined, their work assignments do not meet their ideals, and they still want to engage in literature and art, education, or development as technical experts. Some comrades miss their past military life or rural work, are half-hearted, and are not at ease with their work. Third, some cadres' family lives are difficult to solve, which affects the stability of their work emotions. Based on the above inspection, the leadership should pay serious attention to the learning and life problems of the staff, and establish or instruct appropriate institutions to specifically study and solve them.

　　In terms of financial expenditure, the budget system was not strictly implemented, and there was a lack of precise calculation.

　　(2) Inspection of financial expenditure: First, the budget system was not strictly implemented. From the establishment of the Government Administration Council to April this year, 58% of the temporary expenses were "acting first and reporting later." Second, there was a lack of precise calculation, or due to the difficulty in grasping the situation, the budget was increased for the convenience of using money. For example, the Reception Office's regular entertainment expenses from January to May this year exceeded the actual expenditure by more than 60,000 catties of millet, and the budget for March was increased by 100%. The Government Administration Council Office's temporary expenses budget in December 1949 was 1.4 billion yuan, but only 500 million yuan was actually spent. Third, expenditure was not controlled according to the budget. For example, the budget for building a nursery was 200 million yuan, but 400 million yuan was actually spent, exceeding the budget by 100%. Overspending on office supplies averaged 85%. Fourth, there was a failure to distinguish between priorities. In the case of financial and economic difficulties, the roof of the Government Administration Council's building was completely plastered this year. The Reception Office's clinic purchased surgical beds and distillation pots, costing more than 3.2 million yuan, which was not necessary. Fifth, expenditures were not made according to the original budget items. For example, a temporary budget fee for the Government Administration Council Office in December 1949 originally listed 18 reams of paper, but as a result, the money was used to buy other office supplies. The house layout plan of a certain office was cancelled, but the budget was not cancelled with the Ministry of Finance, and the money was received for turnover. Sixth, funds were decentralized and accumulated. As of this inspection, the Government Administration Council still owed the Ministry of Finance 4.5 billion yuan (expenses and production funds, borrowing, advances, etc. that have not been reimbursed and cannot be reimbursed), because each unit received advances and did not reimburse them, or deposited checks. Based on the above inspection, the following improvement suggestions were put forward: such as holding a budget symposium, inviting the Ministry of Finance to participate, discussing the budget system and budget procedures; establishing a budget preparation procedure, strictly implementing the accounting system, separating the finance department from the supply department, and so on.

　　Losses and waste in procurement, reception, and use and storage of goods need to be overcome.

　　(3) Waste in procurement, reception, and use and storage of goods: Purchases were made without planning and without calculating the amount needed. Whatever was wanted was purchased in large quantities, and the amount of waste was astounding. For example, the Government Administration Council bought Great Wall original paper, Japanese carbon paper, general ledgers, etc., freezing 51 million yuan in cash. It bought ten tricycles (only one was used), Russian, French, and Chinese typewriters, etc., worth more than 53 million yuan, which were stored unused. The above two items froze a total of 100 million yuan in funds. In addition, because no one reviewed the purchases, the quality of the goods purchased was poor and could not be used, or a small amount was used but a large amount was purchased, which also caused a lot of waste. In terms of reception, when holding banquets, because the number of people could not be well controlled, there was often a phenomenon of leftover food not being disposed of, resulting in great waste. In terms of the use and storage of furniture, because the purchase of furniture was mostly done independently, newly purchased items were generally not numbered and registered. Although there were registration numbers after allocation, there was too much free movement, making it difficult to count. At one time, most of the furniture was scattered in the courtyard. Due to leaks and dampness in the warehouse, all stored stoves, iron kettles, and chimneys were rusted, the switches of thirteen electric fans were leaking electricity, and the cloth and cotton of nine new double wooden beds were moldy. Other problems were found in housing construction and allocation, car use, etc., and methods and systems for improvement were formulated. Especially in the area of automobiles, ideological education for the working class was carried out for the drivers, which improved their class consciousness, and the bad influence left by the old society on the drivers was examined and reflected upon. Twenty drivers voluntarily confessed to stealing fuel. During the CPPCC meeting, they stole a total of 1,328 gallons of fuel, worth about 45 million yuan.

　　The streamlining and thrift inspection of the Central People's Government Committee Office and Government Administration Council directly subordinate units has achieved good results due to the responsibility of the leaders, their personal involvement, unified leadership, and the adoption of the mass line method, which improved everyone's understanding and enlightened everyone's awareness. Even during the period when inspections were still underway, some extravagant and wasteful phenomena had been overcome. For example, even while studying documents on streamlining and thrift, some units voluntarily returned surplus office supplies, bicycles, etc. to the supply section, and automatically strengthened their business studies. This is not only of great significance to saving national financial expenditure and "striving for a fundamental improvement in the national financial and economic situation," but also helps to improve the work of government agencies and lay the foundation for long-term streamlining and thrift in the future.

　　中央人民政府委员会办公厅及政务院直属单位
    全面检查精简节约
    首长负责，统一领导，收效极大
    【本报讯】中央人民政府委员会办公厅和政务院直属单位，自七月上旬展开精简节约检查，至八月下旬已经结束。
    中央人民政府委员会办公厅及政务院直属单位在七月初接获政务院精简节约检查的办法以后，即召开动员大会，进行思想动员，并由各单位负责同志组成四个检查小组，分别负责进行人员编制、经费开支、房屋的修建和分配、交通工具和家具保管等项的检查工作。各组都作出详细的检查计划和检查提纲。党、团支部主动配合。同时学委会布置学习有关精简节约的文件。主要根据毛主席在中共中央三中全会的报告，号召大家切实体会“国家机构开支大量缩减”的重要意义。经过座谈、讨论，展开批评和自我批评，使精简节约的检查形成热烈的运动，随即展开了全面检查。经过检查，发现如下问题：
    不适合业务需要的人员编制及机构需要调整。
    （一）对于精简方面的检查：首先研究了上半年的人员编制。上半年拟定编制时，机构刚刚建立，工作尚未开展，有些单位的工作范围和职掌还不甚明确，所以上半年的编制，一部分是不适合业务需要的。有的单位现有人员虽不及编制数额，但工作并未感到难以支持。如秘书处现比原定编制缺二十一人，却完成了工作任务。有些单位，业务范围增大，工作继续开展，工作机构需要调整，工作人员需要增加，如机要处、总务处、资料室、人事局都有这种情况。有的单位，如预算室，职掌及业务范围至今尚未明确。编制上的另一个问题是：因干部少，互相兼职，造成行政部门与企业化单位的关系混淆不清。如交际处与所辖的饭店，修建科与修建公司，交通科与汽车修理厂等机构，人事均未明确分开，行政与企业的业务均未划分清楚。根据以上情况，提出了有关编制的意见：今后确定编制，首先必须明确各单位的职掌与任务，不宜再作偏宽或偏紧的粗率估计。人事局、总务处、机要处，都应考虑组织形式与内部机构的调整。预算室的任务及其与财政部的工作关系，应迅速明确规定。企业单位与行政单位，其机构与人事，必须严格分开。
    关于工作人员的质量及工作态度问题：在检查这一点时，主要着重工作态度的检查。在工作人员的质量及工作态度方面，除了检查出个别不称职的人员外，大部分同志的工作态度是很老实负责的，服从组织分配，忠心耿耿的想把工作做好；但也有一部分工作人员对工作不够安心。例如：交际处去年十二月以前，不安心工作的占百分之九十，经半年来的学习及工作检查，现在尚占百分之三十。人事局不安心工作的占三分之一。不安心工作的原因主要有三方面：第一是机关工作以及学习等制度没有很好地建立起来，领导上对这方面注意不够。第二是干部本身的工作问题和思想问题。如有的干部因文化水平低，也有因业务生疏，虽怀热情而做不好工作，因而产生失望不安心的情绪；另一些人，由于工作职位未定，工作分配不合自己的理想，老存着搞文艺、教育、或向技术专家方面发展的念头；还有的同志怀念着过去的军队生活，或农村工作，三心二意，不安心工作。第三，有些干部家庭生活困难不能解决，影响了工作情绪的安定。根据以上的检查，领导上对工作人员的学习和生活各方面的问题，应该严重加以注意，并建立或责成适当机构具体研究解决。
    在财政开支上，没有认真执行预算制度，缺乏精确计算。
    （二）对财政开支的检查：一、没有认真执行预算制度。自政务院成立至今年四月，临时费百分之五十八是“先斩后奏”的。二、缺乏精确计算，或因情况难于掌握，为了用钱方便而多造预算。如交际处，本年一至五月份的经常招待费，预算数比实际开支数超过六万斤小米以上，三月份则多造百分之百。政府办公厅一九四九年十二月份临时费预算十四亿元，实际只开支五亿元。三、不根据预算来掌握开支。如修建托儿所预算二亿元，实际用了四亿元，超过预算百分之百。办公用品平均超支百分之八十五。四、不善于分别轻重缓急。在财政经济困难情况下，今年政务院的房顶全部抹灰。交际处医务所购置手术床及蒸溜锅，用款三百二十余万元，此项也并非必需。五、不按原预算所列项目开支。如一九四九年十二月政府办公厅一份临时预算费，原列十八令纸，但结果将这笔款买了其他办公用品。某处房舍布置计划取消了，却不向财政部注销预算，并把款领来作为周转之用。六、分散和积压资金。至此次检查时为止，政务院尚欠财政部四十五亿元（尚未报销和不能报销的开支及生产资金、借支、垫款等），原因是各单位均领来垫款不报销，或存放支票。根据以上检查，提出如下改进意见：如召开预算座谈会，请财部参加，座谈预算制度及预算手续；建立预算编制程序，严格会计制度，财务部门与供给部门分开等等。
    采购、招待、物品使用与保管四方面的损失及浪费现象需要克服。
    （三）在采购、招待、物品使用与保管等方面的浪费问题：购置无计划，不计算需要量，想要什么即大批购置，浪费数目大得惊人。如政务院买长城原纸、日本复写纸、总账单等，冻结现款五千一百多万元。买三轮车十辆（只用一辆），俄、法、华文打字机等，折款五千三百多万元，存放未用。以上两宗共冻结资金一亿元。此外，因买东西无人审查，买来后质坏不能使用，或用少买多，亦造成很大的浪费。招待方面，举行宴会时，因人数不能很好掌握，经常发生剩余食品无人处理的现象，因而造成很大浪费。家具的使用与保管方面，由于购置家具多是各自为政，所以新购者一般没有编号登记，分配后虽有登记对号，但自由搬动太多，不易清点。曾有一个时候，多数家具散放院中。由于库房漏雨潮湿，所存火炉、铁壶、烟筒等全部生锈，十三个电扇的电门走电，九个新双人木床的布和棉花霉烂了。其他关于房屋修建、分配，汽车使用等，都检查出一些问题，并订出改进的方法和制度。尤其在汽车方面，对司机进行了工人阶级的思想教育，提高了司机的阶级觉悟，检查、反省了旧社会遗留给司机的坏影响。有二十位司机同志自动坦白出偷油的事实，他们在政协会议期间，共偷油一千三百二十八加仑，折款四千五百万元左右。
    中央人民政府委员会办公厅和政务院直属单位的精简节约检查，由于首长负责，亲自动手，统一领导，采取群众路线的方法，提高了大家的认识，启发了大家的觉悟，收到了很好的效果。尚在进行检查的期间，某些铺张浪费的现象，就已被克服。如还在学习着精简节约文件的时候，就有的单位自动将多余的办公用品、自行车等缴还供给科，并自动的加强了业务学习。这不但对当前节省国家财政开支，“争取国家财政经济情况的基本好转”有着重大的意义，并有助于改进政府机关工作，打下今后长期精简节约的基础。（张白水）
