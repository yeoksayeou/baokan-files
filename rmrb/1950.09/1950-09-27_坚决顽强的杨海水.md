　　Resolute and Tenacious Yang HaiShui
    Chang Gong
    Comrade Yang HaiShui, a combat hero representative from the Northeast Military Region attending the National Conference of Combat Heroes, was once a poor peasant child from Shen County, Hebei Province, and is now the Chief of Staff of a certain regiment in the Northeast Military Region.
    Since joining the army in 1938, he has always stood at the forefront of the struggle, enduring hardships and uniting the broad masses. Especially in dozens of brutal and intense battles, he has fully demonstrated the characteristics of the People's Liberation Army: active, brave, resolute, tenacious, mobile, and decisive.
    As early as the Anti-Japanese War, he became famous in battle.
    At that time, he was a guard for the regimental commander. Once, the troops were attacking an enemy stronghold, and several charges were unsuccessful. When the regimental commander called for the organization of a commando team, he picked up two hand grenades and was the first to volunteer. Then, when the charge began, he ran at the very front, and finally captured the enemy stronghold, achieving a great victory.
    During the war to liberate the Northeast, his deeds spread even further throughout southern Liaoning.
    At that time, southern Liaoning was the enemy's rear, but he and his troops persisted there. Not only did they not bow to the frenzied enemy, but they also beat the enemy until they fled in disarray, becoming a banner of our army's persistent struggle in southern Liaoning.
    During the first offensive by our army towards the southern section of the China Changchun Railway, more than a thousand men from the enemy's 148th Division in Dashiqiao retreated to Xiaoqiaozi in the west to hold out for reinforcements. The main force of our army attacking from the northwest direction had made several unsuccessful charges and was pinned down by enemy fire in an open area, unable to advance or retreat. Yang HaiShui then received orders from the regimental commander to lead twelve men with three machine guns, penetrate Xiaoqiaozi from the enemy's rear, first eliminate the enemy's artillery company, and then cooperate with the main force's frontal attack, finally causing all the enemies to lay down their weapons. The most critical situation was after they penetrated Xiaoqiaozi, only six of the twelve men remained, two of the three machine guns were destroyed, and there were few hand grenades and bullets left. Especially when enemies from all directions came to attack them, Comrade Yang HaiShui was very calm, commanding everyone to fight the enemy while issuing an appeal to everyone: even if we have only one person left, we must complete the task, fight together, and die together. Finally, they defeated the enemy's counterattack and launched a fierce offensive.
    During the second offensive by our army towards the southern section of the China Changchun Railway, Yang HaiShui and his company were tasked with eliminating the enemy's outer stronghold, Da Lei Mountain, near Dashiqiao. At that time, the regimental commander asked him if he was confident. He firmly replied: As long as I, Yang HaiShui, am here, I will definitely take Da Lei Mountain. Listen: tonight, we will make hand grenades bloom on the hilltop. That night, he personally led the assault team, each carrying many hand grenades. As soon as the enemy discovered them, their hand grenades were thrown over, and in less than half an hour, the enemies on Da Lei Mountain were completely annihilated.
    His heroic deeds are endless. After becoming a battalion commander in 1948, he participated in the final battle to liberate the Northeast and the Fengtai battle to liberate Beijing and Tianjin. After becoming the regimental chief of staff in 1949, he successively participated in the Yisha battle to liberate Central South and the Wanxian battle to liberate the Southwest. In every battle, he was the same as in the past: standing at the forefront of the battle.
    This time, he was selected as the combat hero representative of the Northeast Military Region to attend the National Conference of Combat Heroes, and he felt infinite excitement and glory. He believes that the task of the People's Liberation Army today should be to defend the motherland and liberate Taiwan and Tibet, and to oppose the war plots of the American imperialist aggressors. Therefore, it is necessary to build a modern and strong national defense force. If the American imperialist aggressors attempt to sabotage our motherland and obstruct our liberation of Taiwan, then their invading troops must be completely and thoroughly annihilated.

　　坚决顽强的杨海水
    常工
    出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的东北军区战斗英雄代表杨海水同志，过去是一个出身于河北深县贫苦农民的孩子，现在则是东北军区某团的参谋长。
    他从一九三八年参军以后，就一直站在斗争的最前线，能够忍受艰难困苦，能够团结广大群众，特别是在数十次残酷与激烈的战斗中，他都充分表现了人民解放军的特色，这就是积极、勇敢、坚决、顽强、机动和果敢。
    远在抗日战争的时候，他就在战斗中出了名。
    那时他给团长作警卫员，有一次部队去打一个敌人的据点，几次冲锋都没有奏效，当团长叫组织突击队时，他拿起两个手榴弹，就首先站出来报名，接着冲锋开始以后，他又跑在最前面，最后终于攻下了那个敌人的据点，获得很大的胜利。
    在解放东北的战争中，他的事迹更传遍辽南。
    那时辽南是敌人的后方，他却和部队坚持在辽南，不但没有向疯狂的敌人低头，并且把敌人打得到处抱头鼠窜，成为辽南我军坚持斗争的一面旗帜。
    第一次我军向中长路南段的攻势中，大石桥的敌人一四八师千余人，便转移到西面的小桥子固守待援，从西北方向进攻的我军主力，几次冲锋都没有成功，且被敌人火力压制在一片开阔地上，不能前进也不能后退。杨海水便奉团长的命令，带了十二个人与三挺机枪，从敌人的后方插进小桥子，首先解决敌人的炮兵连，以后又配合正面主力的进攻，终使全部敌人放下了武器。其中情况最严重的时候，是他们插进小桥子以后，十二个人只剩下六个人，三挺机枪打坏两挺，手榴弹和子弹也剩不多，特别是四面八方的敌人，都来进攻他们，当时杨海水同志非常沉着，一面指挥大家与敌战斗，一面又向大家发出号召：我们剩一个人也要完成任务，战斗在一起，死也死在一起，最后终于击溃了敌人的反击，并且展开了猛烈的进攻。
    第二次我军向中长路南段的攻势中，杨海水和他的连队，又担任消灭大石桥敌人外围据点大雷山的任务。当时团长问他有没有把握？他坚决回答说：只要有我杨海水在，一定能拿下大雷山，你们听着：今晚要叫手榴弹在山头上开花。当晚他便亲自带上突击队，每人都带着好多手榴弹，敌人刚一发现，他们的手榴弹就扔过去，不到半个钟头，大雷山上的敌人便被全部歼灭。
    他的英雄事迹是写不完的。一九四八年他作营长以后，又参加了解放东北的最后战役，和解放京津的丰台战斗。一九四九年他作团参谋长后，先后又参加了解放中南的宜沙战斗，与解放西南的万县战斗。每一次战斗，他都同样和过去一样：站在战斗的最前线。
    这次他被选为出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的东北军区战斗英雄代表，他感到了无限的兴奋和光荣。他认为人民解放军的任务，今天应该是保卫祖国与解放台湾、西藏，反对美帝国主义侵略者发动战争的阴谋，因此必须建设现代化的强大国防军，如果美国帝国主义侵略者，企图破坏我们祖国和阻碍我们解放台湾，那一定要把他们的侵略军队全部彻底的歼灭。
