　　"Thick Smoke" Lingers Above Drum Tower in Beijing
　　Turns Out to Be Swarms of Mosquitoes

　　[Our Dispatch] On the two corners of the Drum Tower in Beijing, for the past few days, a wisp resembling thick smoke has appeared around 6 PM every day, lingering without dissipating. Many curious onlookers have gathered to watch. Unable to understand the true situation, they have speculated that the tower was emitting smoke. To thoroughly understand the true situation, the local Public Security Bureau dispatched workers on the 15th to erect a wooden frame to the top of the tower. At 6:30 PM on the same day, personnel from the Public Security Bureau accompanied colleagues from the Drum Tower Education Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to observe. The colleagues from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, together with the workers who erected the wooden frame, climbed the frame to the top of the tower and discovered that it was a large number of small flying insects gathering and not dispersing. They immediately used a white cloth cover to capture a large number of these flying insects. Onlookers below witnessed this situation, and the doubts were dispelled, and they responded with warm applause. According to colleagues from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, these are a type of mosquito that grows in moist muddy areas and may have flown from Shichahai. They are currently studying the details of this type of mosquito.

　　京市鼓楼顶上“浓烟”萦绕
    原来是蚊虫飞舞不散
    【本报讯】京市鼓楼顶上两角，近几日来，每日下午六时左右，有形似浓烟一缕，萦绕不散。很多好奇者聚集观看。因未能了解事实真象，纷纷揣测，以为楼顶冒烟。该管区公安局为彻底了解事实真象，于十五日派工人架设木架至楼顶，于当日晚六时三十分由公安局派人伴同中国科学院鼓楼教育馆工作同志等，前往观察。中国科学院的工作同志会同架设木架的工人等登木架至楼顶，发现是很多小飞虫飞聚不散。当时即用白布罩捕捉此类飞虫甚多。楼下围观市民目睹此情况，疑团顿释，皆报以热烈掌声。据中国科学院的同志称：此系一种蚊虫，生长在潮湿泥水地方，可能是由什刹海飞来。现在他们正在研究此种蚊虫的详情。
