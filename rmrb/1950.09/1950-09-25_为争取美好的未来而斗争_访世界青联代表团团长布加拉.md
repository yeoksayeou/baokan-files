　　Struggling for a Better Future
    ——An Interview with Boukalla, Head of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Delegation

    On September 23, the first day the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) delegation arrived in Beijing, the head of the delegation, Boukalla, enthusiastically shook hands with the reporter and said: "From the Northeast to Beijing, we have been warmly welcomed and treated with friendship by the Chinese people and youth. Being in your country really makes me feel very excited and happy!"

    The topic focused on the movement to defend world peace. Boukalla calmly and forcefully pointed out that defending peace is the most important work of the WFDY. It mobilizes millions of young people to promote the peace signature campaign. Because democratic youth all over the world need peace, the movement to defend peace is a good foundation for uniting the broad masses of young people. Through the movement to defend peace, democratic youth all over the world are united more firmly and powerfully. Therefore, at the WFDY Executive Committee meeting held in Berlin not long ago, it was particularly emphasized that democratic youth should further participate in defending peace.

    Boukalla said: Under the leadership of the WFDY, the peace movement of young people in various countries has made great achievements. In Italy, young people have already collected more than 408,600 signatures; in Japan, young people have collected 739,628 signatures; in France, young people have collected 309,000 signatures; and even in Spain, under the most reactionary rule, the peace signature movement is also being widely carried out; the vast majority of the United States’ two million peace signatories were mobilized by young people.

    The WFDY also uses competition methods to promote the peace signature movement. The WFDY Executive Committee meeting held in Berlin once proposed a signature competition between Paris, Berlin, and Rome. As a result, Berlin came first, Rome second, and Paris third.

    This kind of competition method was quickly adopted by everyone. Now young people in the United Kingdom are challenging young people in the United States, and young people in Scandinavia are also challenging each other. Moreover, within the same country, it is often one province versus another, one city versus another, competing with each other.

    Here, Comrade Boukalla talked about the story of young people from France and Italy gathering in Nice. He said: Young people from the two countries, disregarding the obstruction of the reactionary governments, flocked to Nice, France, to gather and shout slogans together: "Youth unite! Defend peace! Ban the atomic bomb!" This gathering, held in a capitalist country, made the war-mongers panic. They used methods such as refusing to issue passports to obstruct it, and even used secret agents to place bombs in the hostels where democratic youth were staying to intimidate them, but the gathering was still held successfully. By the time it closed, more than 30,000 democratic youth had participated in the demonstration. Representatives from the United Kingdom, Belgium, Switzerland, and other countries also participated in this gathering.

    Boukalla turned the topic to Spain, saying:
    “Tens of thousands of young people in Spain are imprisoned in prisons, hunger and disease are looming over the country, and many unemployed young people can only find food in garbage dumps. According to the mayor of the reactionary government of Madrid himself, more than half of the young people in the city suffer from lung disease." Comrade Boukalla continued: "Spanish youth have never stopped resisting the reactionary government. The underground fire is burning throughout the country. Secretly published newspapers and periodicals can be read anytime and anywhere. Even under the terrible police rule, struggling young people still find opportunities to post slogans on the walls. In the vast rural areas, the armed struggle of the guerrillas is growing stronger day by day!"

    Boukalla said that the WFDY has been carrying out vigorous movements to support Spanish youth against the reactionary rule of the Franco regime. April 14 is the Spanish Youth Day, and young people in many places around the world hold rallies and demonstrations to support the just struggle of Spanish youth.

    Boukalla pointed out that young people in all colonial countries are the most suffering young people. The WFDY calls on young people all over the world to launch various movements to support the struggle of colonial youth for national independence. The number of colonial youth participating in the WFDY has recently increased from 3.5 million to 9 million, which is the result of the WFDY's concern for colonial youth. The WFDY also sent representatives to various colonial countries to understand the situation and express their condolences.

    Comrade Boukalla said: "Among all international organizations, only the WFDY has a Day Against Colonialism (note: on February 21st every year). On this day, young people from all over the world hold rallies and demonstrations to oppose the colonial system."

    He mentioned the US imperialism, which is deeply hated by peace-loving people all over the world:
    “The WFDY especially opposes the US imperialist aggression against Korea. Since the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea was launched, the WFDY has called on young people all over the world to support the just struggle of the Korean people. Tens of thousands of young people in countries all over the world have received this call and have held rallies and demonstrations to oppose US imperialism. Italian youth marched to the front of the US consulate to demonstrate, French youth sent telegrams of protest, and democratic youth in the United Kingdom and the United States also responded together."

    After the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea was launched, the peace signature movement surged even higher. The WFDY also responded to the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions and called on young people to participate in the Anti-US Aggression Movement Week.

    Finally, Comrade Boukalla enthusiastically talked about his feelings after this visit to the Northeast. He said that he was deeply moved by the high level of political awareness and internationalist spirit of our Northeast youth. He was also deeply moved by the Soviet Union's assistance to our Northeast construction.

    In the Northeast, the delegation witnessed the great strides forward in construction. In Qiqihar, the representatives visited a collective farm, where young farmers were learning to use agricultural machinery and learning to drive tractors and harvesters. In Harbin and Shenyang, the delegation visited several factories and saw the enthusiastic work of young workers in the Northeast in building the motherland's production. Boukalla said: "Several representatives from capitalist countries also felt that some of the industry in the Northeast has already developed more than in their own countries."

    Mentioning the Soviet Union's assistance to our Northeast, he cited a typical example: "There is a 75-year-old Soviet worker who, according to his age, should have retired, but he is still willing to stay in the Northeast and work with the Chinese people. Such enthusiasm and sincerity cannot fail to deeply move anyone."

    Comrade Boukalla recalled the words of a Soviet engineer when he visited a shipyard in Dalian: "Chinese workers learn very quickly. It only takes a short time for them to learn the technology, master the latest production methods, and quickly improve themselves."

    In the two-and-a-half-hour conversation, Comrade Boukalla remained cheerful and energetic, as if he had not traveled a long distance. When the reporter said goodbye, Comrade Boukalla said clearly:
    “China's future is full of brilliance. Chinese youth will surely create a better life through hard work in construction. After we go back, we must tell the broad masses of young people what we have seen and heard in China. We want to tell them that Chinese youth are holding high the banner of peace and democracy here, and that Chinese youth are making a huge contribution to the cause of world peace.” (with picture)

### 为争取美好的未来而斗争——访世界青联代表团团长布加拉

专栏：世界青联代表访问记

　　为争取美好的未来而斗争
    ——访世界青联代表团团长布加拉
    九月二十三日，世界民主青年联盟代表团到达北京的第一天，代表团团长布加拉和记者热烈地握着手说：“从东北到北京，到处都受到中国人民与青年热烈的欢迎与友谊的招待，在你们的国家里，真使我觉得十分兴奋和愉快！”
    话题集中在保卫世界和平运动上，布加拉沉着有力地指出：保卫和平是世界青联最主要的工作，它动员了千百万的青年来推动和平签名运动。由于全世界民主青年都需要和平，保卫和平运动又是团结广大的青年群众的良好基础。通过保卫和平运动，全世界民主青年团结得更坚固更强大了。因此在不久以前在柏林召开的世界青联执委会，特别强调了民主青年应该进一步地参加保卫和平。
    布加拉说：在世界青联的发动下，各国青年的和平运动有了很大的成绩。在意大利，青年们已经收集了四百另八万六千多人的签名；在日本，青年们已经收集了七十三万九千六百二十八个人的签名；在法国，青年们收集了三十万九千人的签名；甚至在最反动统治下的西班牙，和平签名运动也在广泛地开展；美国的二百多万和平签名者，绝大部分是由青年所推动的。
    世界青联还用竞赛的方法来推广和平签名运动，在柏林召开的世界青联执委会曾倡议举行巴黎、柏林、罗马的签名竞赛。结果柏林得到第一，罗马第二，巴黎第三。
    这种竞赛方式，很快地被大家所采用，现在英国的青年正与美国的青年相互挑战，斯坎的那维亚半岛上的青年也相互挑战。而且，在同一个国家里，往往是一省与另一省，一城与另一城，在互相竞赛。
    这里，布加拉同志谈到了法国和意大利两国青年在尼斯聚会的故事。他说：两国青年曾不顾反动政府的阻挠，纷纷向法国尼斯集合，一同高喊口号：“青年们团结起来！保卫和平！禁止原子弹！”这次大聚会在资本主义的国家里召开，使那些战争贩子惊惶失措，他们用拒发护照等方法来阻止，甚至用特务把炸弹放到民主青年住宿的招待所来恫吓，但是聚会仍旧胜利地举行了，到闭幕的时候，有三万多个民主青年参加了示威游行。英国、比利时、瑞士等国青年也都有代表参加这个聚会。
    布加拉的话题转向了西班牙，他说：
    “西班牙成千成万的青年被监禁在监牢里，饥饿与疾病笼罩着全国，很多失业的青年只能在垃圾堆里找食物，据玛德里反动政府的市长自己招供，全城青年有一半以上患了肺病。”布加拉同志接着说：“西班牙青年没有一分钟停止过对反动政府的反抗，地下火燃烧在全国，秘密出版的报刊随时随地可以读到，虽然在恐怖的警察统治下，斗争着的青年们仍旧找寻机会在墙壁上张贴标语。在广大的农村里，游击队的武装斗争一天天地更壮大了！”
    布加拉说：世界青联一直展开有力的运动支持着西班牙青年反对佛朗哥政权的反动统治，四月十四日是西班牙青年的节日，全世界很多地方的青年集会示威支持西班牙青年的正义斗争。
    布加拉指出：所有殖民地国家的青年是最受痛苦的青年。世界青联号召全世界青年展开各种运动来支援殖民地青年要求民族独立的斗争。殖民地青年参加世界青联的人数最近从三百五十万增加到九百万，这是世界青联对殖民地青年关心的结果。世界青联还派了代表到各殖民地国家去了解情况，慰问他们。
    布加拉同志说：“在所有的国际组织里，只有世界青联有反对殖民地制度斗争日（按：在每年二月二十一日），在这个节日，全世界各国青年都集会示威，来反对殖民制度。”
    他提到了为全世界和平人民所深恶痛绝的美帝国主义时说：
    “世界青联特别反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，自从美帝侵朝战争发动以来，世界青联号召全世界青年支援朝鲜人民的正义斗争。全世界各国成千成万的青年接到这个号召，纷纷集会、示威反对美帝国主义。意大利青年游行到美国领事馆门前去示威，法国青年发电抗议，英国以及美国国内的民主青年也一齐响应。”
    在美帝侵朝战争发动以后，和平签名运动更高涨了。世界青联还响应了世界工联的号召，号召青年参加反美侵略运动周。
    最后，布加拉同志热情地谈到这次访问东北以后的感想。他说他深深地为我们的东北青年高度的政治觉悟与国际主义精神所感动。他也深深地为苏联对于我国东北建设事业的帮助而感动。
    在东北，代表团看到了建设事业的大踏步前进。在齐齐哈尔，代表参观了集体农场，那里青年农民正在学习使用农业机械，学习驾驶拖拉机与收割机。在哈尔滨和沈阳，代表团参观了几个工厂，看到了东北青年工人在建设祖国生产事业中的热烈工作。布加拉说：“代表团中几个来自资本主义国家的代表，也觉得东北有一部分工业已经比他们国家里的发展了。”
    提到苏联对我们东北的帮助，他举了一个典型的例子：“有一个七十五岁高龄的苏联老工人，按照年龄来说，他是应该休养了的，可是他仍愿留在东北与中国人民一起工作，这样热情与诚意是任何人不会不深深感动的。”
    布加拉同志回忆起在参观大连一个船坞时一个苏联工程师的话：“中国工人学习的很快，只要花很少的时间，他们便学会了技术，掌握了最新的生产方法，迅速地提高自己。”
    在二个半小时的长谈中，布加拉同志始终保持着愉快和精神饱满，好像没有长途跋涉过似的。当记者告辞时，布加拉同志明朗地说：
    “中国的前途充满着光芒，中国青年在建设中努力奋斗一定会创造出美好的生活来的。我们回去以后，一定要把在中国的见闻告诉给广大的青年，我们要告诉他们，中国青年在这里高举着和平民主的大旗，中国青年对于全世界和平事业是有巨大的贡献的。”（附图片）
