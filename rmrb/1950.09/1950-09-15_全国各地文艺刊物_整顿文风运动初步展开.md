　　Initial Unfolding of the Rectification of Writing Style Movement in Literary and Art Periodicals Across the Country

　　[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Reporter Bai Sheng reports: The rectification of writing style movement in literary and art periodicals across the country has initially unfolded. After the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals," "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette), the organ publication of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, took the lead by publishing a preliminary review of its editorial work. It also published an editorial titled "Strengthening Criticism and Self-Criticism in Literary and Art Work," calling on literary and art workers and literary and art newspapers and periodicals to launch a criticism and self-criticism movement. Subsequently, literary and art periodicals in various regions responded enthusiastically, examining the editorial work of their respective publications, and initially strengthening the combat effectiveness of the periodicals, and strengthening the ties with authors and the masses of readers. In the middle of last month, under the initiation of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, editors of major literary and art periodicals and newspaper literary supplements in Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding held their first symposium in Beijing. They studied and discussed the editorial guidelines and tasks of the various literary and art publications, the division of labor among the publications, their ties with the masses, and some major issues in the current literary and art movement, such as creation and criticism, and the promotion of Chairman Mao's literary and art thought. All publications made sincere and concise reviews of their work and unanimously requested to deeply develop the criticism and self-criticism movement in literary and art publications, strengthen the promotion of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought; and strengthen the close ties between literary and art publications and the broad masses. After this meeting, the literary and art publications in Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding became ideologically clearer on launching criticism and self-criticism and improving editorial work, enabling the work of rectifying the writing style in the literary and art circles to be further developed.
