　　Sichuan Fengjie Private Futai Coal Mine
    Capitalists Disregard Workers' Safety; Fire in Coal Pit Causes Major Casualties

    [Reported by this newspaper] According to a report in the Chongqing Xinhua Daily on August 24th: A fire in the coal pit of the private Futai Coal Mine in Fengjie, Sichuan, has caused a huge tragedy. The coal pit has always had serious methane gas issues, and no one guarded against fire at the pit entrance. On June 15th, coal hauler Wang Houde entered with a lamp and, after only a few steps, it ignited a fire, resulting in 41 deaths and injuries among the coal miners and haulers in the pit.

    The Fengjie County Government immediately dispatched personnel with doctors and medicine. After a day and night of rescue efforts, all the injured and dead workers were brought out of the pit, and the injured were treated. Of those injured, five recovered, but there were still three seriously injured and three slightly injured. Thirty people died successively.

    At the end of June, the Labor Bureau of the Eastern Sichuan Administrative Office sent two cadres, along with Sun Zizhen, the head of the Civil Affairs Section of the Wanxian Special District, to inspect the mine and handle the aftermath. After discussions with the trade union and the capitalists, and considering the limited financial resources of the capitalists, it was decided that the government would help allocate 25,000 catties of relief grain and 700,000 yuan in medical expenses. The capitalists would bear 200,000 yuan in medical expenses and be responsible for burying the dead, as well as provide temporary relief grain of four shi and four dou of corn.

    The cause of the accident: Before entering the pit with his lamp, coal hauler Wang Houde was advised to extinguish the lamp, but he refused to listen, leading to the fire. This was the direct cause of the tragic event. Wang is now detained by the Fengjie County Government. Secondly, the coal mine has been in disrepair for years, and the equipment is rudimentary. For example, the original ventilation duct was two and a half feet high and wide, but now it is only five inches. The climate inside the pit changes frequently. Since liberation, there have been two previous fire incidents, both resulting in casualties (one person injured on February 6th, and two injured and one dead on April 5th), but these did not attract the attention of factory director Wang Baizhen, who represents the capitalists. Before this tragic accident, he readily agreed to allow the fire-control workers to go down the pit to mine coal, resulting in no one guarding against open flames at the entrance. This kind of thinking and behavior that disregards the safety of workers' lives is an important cause of the tragedy. In addition to ordering the capitalists to repair the mine, widen the ventilation equipment, and strengthen the trade union organization, the local government will also impose legal sanctions on those responsible for the accident. Thirdly, the Fengjie County Government and County Trade Union are only fifteen li away from the mine, but they failed to strictly order the mine to strengthen safety equipment. This kind of behavior, which does not care about the safety of workers' lives, should also be reviewed. The Eastern Sichuan Administrative Office is currently studying how to handle those who should be held responsible for the accident.

    Editor's Note: The coal mine fire in Fengjie, Sichuan, is a very serious incident. However, in the investigation and handling of this tragedy, we believe there are two points worth reconsidering: First, regarding the cause of the tragedy, the article only states that "years of disrepair and rudimentary equipment... are important causes..." while the direct cause is "Wang Houde refused to listen to dissuasion." Therefore, the handling only involves "ordering the capitalists to repair the mine and widen the ventilation equipment," while Wang Houde has already been detained by the Fengjie County Government. We believe that such an investigation and handling is putting the cart before the horse and failing to distinguish between the primary and secondary factors. A common worker who caused a fire by refusing to listen to dissuasion should certainly be sanctioned, but his fault should in no way outweigh that of the mine owners who, driven by profit, failed to provide adequate safety measures. We believe it should be affirmed that years of disrepair and rudimentary equipment are the fundamental cause of the tragedy. Second, the People's Government "in order to take care of the capitalists' limited financial resources," helped with a large amount of "relief grain" and "medical expenses." This shows that the local People's Government is very concerned about this tragedy. However, the article does not explain the nature of this huge financial "assistance." If the capitalists are operating the mine for profit, and the government still provides money to "help" in the event of a disaster, that is inappropriate.

### 四川奉节私营福泰煤矿  资方漠视工人生命安全  煤坑失火造成重大伤亡

　　四川奉节私营福泰煤矿
    资方漠视工人生命安全  煤坑失火造成重大伤亡
    【本报讯】据重庆新华日报八月二十四日报载：四川奉节私营福泰煤矿煤坑失火，造成巨大惨案。该煤坑向来瓦斯严重，洞口无人管火。六月十五日拖煤工人王厚德顶灯入内，行不数步，即燃烧起火，坑内挖煤、拖煤工人死伤四十一名。
    奉节县府即日派人带医生药品前往，经一昼夜抢救，将伤亡工人全部救出洞外，予伤者以治疗。除五人治愈外，尚有重伤三人，轻伤三人，先后死亡者三十人。
    六月底，川东行署劳动局曾派出干部二人，协同万县专署民政科长孙子振等到该矿视察，并处理善后。经与工会、资方研究结果，为了照顾资方财力有限，决定由政府帮助拨出救济粮二万五千斤，医药费七十万元，资方负担医药费二十万元，并负责埋葬死者及拿出临时救济粮包谷四石四斗。
    失事原因：拖工王厚德顶灯入坑前，曾有人劝其熄灯前进，但王不听劝阻，致引起大火，是造成此次惨痛事件的直接原因。现王已为奉节县府扣押。其次，煤矿年久失修，设备简陋。如原通风道高宽二尺五寸，现只有五寸；坑内气候不时变化，解放后曾发生过两次失火事件，均有伤亡（二月六日一次伤一人，四月五日一次伤二亡一），但未引起资方厂长王柏桢注意。此次惨案发生前，又轻易同意管火工人下坑挖煤，致洞口无人管制灯火，此种不重视工人生命安全的思想行为，是造成惨案的重要原因。现当地政府除令资方修葺矿坑，改宽通风设备并加强工会组织外，对此次肇事责任，亦将予以法律制裁。第三、奉节县府、县工会距该矿仅十五里，未严令矿方加强安全设备，此种不关心工人生命安全的行为，亦应进行检讨。川东行署对此次失事肇祸应负责者，正分别研究处理中。
    编者按：四川奉节煤矿失火事件是很严重的。但对该惨案的检查与处理上，我们认为有两点值得重新考虑：一是对于造成惨案的原因，文中只说“年久失修，设备简陋……是重要原因……”而直接原因是“王厚德不听劝阻”。所以在处理中就只是“令资方修葺矿坑，改宽通风设备”；而王厚德却已为奉节县府扣押。这样的检查与处理，我们认为是轻重倒置，主次不分。一个普通工人因为不听劝阻而招致火灾，固然应予制裁，但他的罪过无论如何不应重过于只图牟利，不事保安建设的矿方。我们认为应当肯定年久失修，设备简陋是造成惨案的根本原因。二是人民政府“为了照顾资方财力有限”，帮助大批“救济粮”与“医药费”，这说明当地人民政府对此惨案十分关切；但文中并未说明如此巨大资财的“帮助”究系何种性质？如果是资方办矿谋利，遇有灾害政府还拿钱“帮助”，是不应当的。
