　　Questions and Answers

　　Question: What is meant by "Tou Cun" (position)? What are the meanings of its being "loose" and "tight", and how do they affect interest rates and prices? (Asked by Zhuang Jun, et al.)

　　Answer: "Tou Cun," also known as "Yin Gen" (money supply), refers to the relative relationship between the supply of currency and credit in the market and the volume of market transactions from the perspective of the entire market. When the supply of currency and credit exceeds the needs of market transactions, the currency and credit used as a means of payment feel too abundant, and we say that the "Tou Cun is loose" or "Yin Gen is loose." Conversely, when the supply of currency and credit is less than the needs of market transactions, the currency and credit used as a means of payment feel insufficient, and we say that the "Tou Cun is tight" or "Yin Gen is tight." "Tight" and "loose" are relative.

　　From this, we can understand that the factors affecting the tightness or looseness of Tou Cun can be divided into two aspects: first, the expansion or contraction of the quantity of currency and credit; and second, the increase or decrease in the volume of market transactions. The expansion of currency and credit and the decrease in the volume of market transactions are the reasons for the loosening of Tou Cun. The contraction of currency and credit and the increase in the volume of market transactions are the reasons for the tightening of Tou Cun. If both "loose" causes exist simultaneously, the Tou Cun will be extremely loose. If both "tight" causes exist simultaneously, the Tou Cun will be extremely tight. When "loose" and "tight" causes coexist, the state of the Tou Cun depends on which factor is more dominant. If the forces of "loose" and "tight" factors are approximately equal, the state of the Tou Cun will remain largely unchanged.

　　After the state of Tou Cun changes, the first to be affected is the interest rate, and the second is the price. Although Tou Cun is not the only factor affecting interest rates and prices, its impact is greater in the short term. This can be explained in four aspects:

　　First, if the Tou Cun is in a loose state due to currency and credit inflation or this factor being dominant, interest rates will fall to a certain extent. With the effect of other buying factors, prices will rise, resulting in an increase in the means of payment required for the same transaction volume, which can weaken the loose trend of Tou Cun. At the same time, interest rates will gradually increase due to the impact of rising prices, making market credit gradually tighten. However, at this time, the rate of increase in interest rates is not as high as the rate of increase in prices, so it is still profitable to borrow money to stock up on goods. When prices rise to a certain level, if the quantity of currency and credit does not continue to increase, the supply and demand of Tou Cun can be stabilized at this new price level, and the price increase should stop at this point. However, if the factors promoting currency inflation still exist at this time, this stability can be overturned by the emergence of new currency. Then, the Tou Cun becomes looser, and prices rise again. If this continues to develop, the economy will inevitably collapse. The collapse of the pseudo-legal currency and gold yuan under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is the best example.

　　Second, if the Tou Cun gradually loosens due to a decrease in the volume of market transactions or this factor being dominant, interest rates may not necessarily fall, and may even rise in some cases. Prices may not necessarily rise, and may even fall in some cases. Because this phenomenon is often formed due to factors such as the arrival of the off-season, sluggish sales of products, lack of investment opportunities for funds, or excessive risk even if there are investment opportunities. Based on the reduced needs of investors and consumers for goods, prices remain weak despite the loose Tou Cun. Based on the high risk of lending, private banks and money shops dare not lower interest rates and expand credit. Taking the recent example, after the financial and economic unification this year, the value of the currency has stabilized, the false purchasing power of the market has disappeared, and goods have been sluggish. Some private industrialists and businessmen have misunderstandings about government policies and have lost confidence in the future. Therefore, although the deposits of private banks and money shops increased somewhat in March and April, they dared not release them freely. Although there is still some floating capital in the market, prices cannot rise.

　　Third, if the Tou Cun tends to tighten due to currency and credit contraction or this factor being dominant, interest rates will gradually increase to a certain extent. With other selling factors, prices will fall, resulting in a decrease in the means of payment required for the same transaction volume, and the tightening trend of the Tou Cun will gradually weaken. Moreover, interest rates will gradually decrease due to the impact of prices, making market credit tend to loosen. However, at this time, the rate of decrease in interest rates is not as high as the rate of decrease in prices, so it is still profitable to sell goods and save money. When prices fall to a certain level, the supply and demand of Tou Cun will reach a balance, and the price decline should stop. However, if the factors of currency and credit contraction come into play again, this stability is also temporary. The situation during the economic crisis in capitalist countries is exactly like this.

　　Fourth, if the Tou Cun tends to tighten due to an increase in the volume of market transactions or this factor being dominant, it can be divided into two situations: (1) If the increase in the volume of transactions is due to an increase in the supply of goods, the price of these goods will fall to a certain extent if the amount of currency and credit does not increase. If the industry that produces these goods is necessary for the national economy and the people's livelihood, the government should increase the supply of currency and credit through purchases or other means to maintain the price of the goods and their price ratio with other goods. The People's Government's vigorous purchases of agricultural products when they are on the market serve this purpose. From this, we can also see that if a country's economy is developed and production increases, even if the currency gradually increases in the long run, prices will not increase proportionally. The fact that the price increase in Northeast China last year was extremely small while the currency increased more is a strong proof. (2) The increase in the volume of transactions is due to competitive purchases by investors and consumers, like the panic buying movement in the market on the eve of the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Then, prices will not fall even if the currency does not increase, and only the Tou Cun will feel tight. If the currency increases again, prices will rise even more fiercely, and the Tou Cun will still be tight. This is the reason why the market often feels that the Tou Cun is tight during hyperinflation.

　　As for individual banks and money shops, Tou Cun refers to the available funds. For example, "Kuang Tou Cun" (estimating Tou Cun) refers to estimating the available Tou Cun, and "Que Tou Cun" (lack of Tou Cun) refers to the lack of available funds. The meaning is simpler, and it is only explained incidentally here.

　　问题与答复
    问：什么叫做“头寸”？其“松”“紧”的意义及其对于利率与物价的影响如何？（庄俊等提）
    答：“头寸”，也叫做“银根”，就整个市场来说，是表示市场通货、信用的供给量与市场交易量的相对关系。当通货与信用供给量超过市场交易需要的时候，作为交易支付手段的通货与信用感到太多，我们便说“头寸松”或“银根松”；反之，当通货与信用供给量少于市场交易需要的时候，作为交易支付手段的通货与信用感到不够，我们便说“头寸紧”或“银根紧”。“紧”与“松”都是相对的。
    由此，我们便知道影响头寸紧松的因素，可分两方面：一是通货与信用数量的扩张或紧缩，二是市场交易量的增加或减少。通货、信用的扩张与市场交易量的减少是使头寸松弛的原因，通货、信用紧缩与市场交易量增加则是使头寸紧敛的原因，如果两个“松”的原因同时存在，便会使头寸奇松，如果两个“紧”的原因同时存在，便会使头寸奇紧，“松”与“紧”的原因并存时，头寸的态度便决定于比较占优势的那一个因素，如果“松”与“紧”的因素力量接近相等时，则头寸状态大体不变。
    头寸状态变动之后，首先受到影响的是利率，其次便是物价，虽然影响利率物价的不止是头寸，但就短期而论，其影响却较大，兹分四方面来说：
    第一，如果头寸因通货信用膨胀或此一因素占优势而呈松弛状态，则到一定程度时，利率便会下跌，加上别的助买因素的作用，物价便会上涨，结果使同一交易量所需的支付手段增加，便可减弱头寸的松势。同时利率因受物价上升的影响，也会渐渐提高，使市场信用渐渐紧缩。但此时利率的上升率不及物价上涨之甚，因此借钱存货仍旧有利可图。当物价涨至某一水平后，如果通货与信用数量不续增，头寸的供求便可稳定于此一新的物价水平，物价涨势至此也应该停止。但是假如促使通货膨胀的因素此时仍旧存在，则这种稳定又可因新通货的出现而被推翻，于是头寸再松，物价再涨，如此继续发展下去，经济必趋崩溃，国民党反动统治下伪法币与金元券的崩溃过程，就是最好的例子。
    第二，如果头寸因市场交易量减少或此一因素占优势而渐松弛，利率便不一定下跌，有时还可能上涨，物价也不一定上升，有时还可能下降。因为这种现象，往往是由于淡月到来、产品滞销、资金没有出路或虽有出路而风险太大等因素而形成。基于投资者与消费者对商品的需要减少，故头寸虽松，物价仍疲；基于放款风险大，私营银钱业便不敢降低利率，扩大信用。举最近的例来说，今年财经统一之后，币值趋稳，市场的虚假购买力消失，商品滞销，一部分私营工商业家对政府政策有误解，对前途失去信心，所以三、四月间私营行庄的存款虽然增加了一些，却不敢放手放出，市场虽然还有些游资，物价却涨不起来。
    第三，若头寸因通货、信用收缩或此一因素占优势而趋紧，到一定程度时，利息便逐渐提高，配合其他助卖因素，物价便下跌，结果使同一交易量所需的支付手段减少，头寸的紧势便会逐渐减煞。且利率因受物价影响，也会渐渐下降，使市场信用趋松。但此时利率的下降率不及物价下降率之大，所以卖货存钱，仍有利可图，等物价再跌至某一水平后，使头寸的供求达到平衡，物价也应停止跌势。但通货与信用紧缩的因素若再起作用，则此一稳定也是暂时的。资本主义国家经济危机时的情景，正是如此。
    第四，若头寸因市场交易量增加或此一因素占优势而趋紧，便可分两种情况来说：（一）交易量的增加是由于商品供给量的增加，则通货与信用量若不增加，到一定程度后，这种商品的价格便会下跌。假使生产这种商品的产业是国计民生所必需的，政府便应该用收购或其他方式，增加通货与信用的供给，维持该商品的价格及其与其他商品的价比，人民政府于农产品上市时之大力收购，其用意之一，便在这里。由此，我们也可看出：如果一国的经济发达，生产增加，从长期看，即使通货逐渐增加，物价也不会等比例提高的。去年内东北物价的上涨极微而通货增加较多，便是有力的证明。（二）交易量的增加系由于投资者与消费者的竞购，像国民党反动统治崩溃前夕市场的抢购运动一样，则通货不增，物价也不会跌，只觉得头寸紧，若通货再增，物价便涨得更凶，头寸仍旧紧。通货恶性膨胀时市场常觉头寸紧，原因便在这里。
    至于就个别行庄来说，头寸即指可用的款项，譬如说“匡头寸”，即指预计可用的头寸，“缺头寸”即指缺乏可用的款项，意义较简单，于此仅附带说明一下。
