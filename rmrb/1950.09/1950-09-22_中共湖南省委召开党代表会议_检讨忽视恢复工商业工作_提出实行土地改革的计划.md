Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 20th: The Second Party Representatives' Meeting of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was held from August 7th to September 1st. A total of 446 people attended, including members of the Provincial Committee, secretaries of local committees and county committees, and representatives of the Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs' Party Committees. The central task of this meeting was to summarize the work of the province in the year since liberation, to rectify the ideology and work style of cadres, and to study and research land reform policies and the specific conditions of Hunan, so as to carry out land reform in some areas of the province in a step-by-step and orderly manner this winter and next spring.

At the beginning of the meeting, Huang Kecheng, secretary of the Provincial Committee, delivered a report on the work of the province in the past year. Based on this report, the meeting conducted an in-depth review of various tasks. The meeting considered that the work of the various levels of organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province in the past year had been successful. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central South Bureau, they mobilized and organized the people of the entire province, cooperated with the People's Liberation Army's advance, and achieved the peaceful liberation of Changsha; orderly took over the cities and villages, established democratic power; supported the People's Liberation Army in liberating South China and Southwest China; and carried out major tasks such as suppressing bandits, providing disaster relief, rent reduction, and grain tax collection. The meeting also pointed out the shortcomings and errors in the work that came with the achievements. The meeting emphasized that the work of restoring urban and rural industry and commerce in the past year had not been done enough. The Provincial Committee did not have sufficient understanding of the importance of industry and commerce in Hunan, and only focused on restoring agricultural production, and did not conduct good investigations and research on the situation of industry and commerce, thus many shortcomings occurred in the work. In terms of cadre work style, there was bureaucracy and commandism, especially commandism was the most serious. Lower-level cadres often used coercive orders to "complete tasks", causing dissatisfaction among the masses.

In reviewing the overall work, the meeting linked it to the ideological work style of individuals and launched criticism and self-criticism. At the meeting, some local committees first conducted a profound self-examination of their leadership style, eliminating some cadres' understanding of "rectifying the lower levels but not the upper levels," which greatly inspired the self-criticism spirit of the cadres. During the discussion of commandism in work style, the meeting discovered some erroneous ideas, but after leading cadres took the lead in self-examination and mutual criticism, they were corrected. For example, some cadres of the Yiyang Local Committee emphasized objective reasons such as the complex environment, heavy tasks, few cadres, and unmobilized masses in the new area, believing that commandism was inevitable; instead of reviewing from the perspective of ideological work style. After discussion, criticism and enlightenment, everyone further reflected. They unanimously recognized that commandism is a reflection of individual ideological work style of not believing in the masses and not paying attention to specific situations, and it is completely possible and necessary to overcome it.

Finally, based on the Land Reform Law promulgated by the Central People's Government, the demands of the peasant masses in various parts of the province, and the preparation work, the meeting proposed a plan to implement land reform in areas with a population of 16 million in Hunan this winter and next spring, and studied the specific steps of land reform and relevant specific policy issues. During the discussion and research, the representatives gained a deeper understanding of various land reform policies. Now, the representatives from various places have returned to their respective areas with the spirit of the meeting, preparing to further deepen the rectification movement among lower-level party members and cadres.

　　中共湖南省委召开党代表会议
    检讨忽视恢复工商业工作  提出实行土地改革的计划
    【新华社长沙二十日电】中共湖南省第二次党代表会议已于八月七日至九月一日举行。出席省委委员、各地委、县委书记和省直属机关党委代表共四百四十六人。此次会议的中心任务是：总结该省解放一年来的工作，整顿干部的思想作风，学习和研究土地改革政策和湖南具体情况，以便今冬明春有步骤、有秩序地在该省部分地区进行土地改革。
    会议首由省委书记黄克诚作了该省一年来的工作报告。会议根据这一报告，深入地检查了各种工作。会议认为：中共湖南省各级组织一年来的工作是有成绩的。在中共中央和中南局的领导下，动员和组织了全省人民，配合人民解放军的进军，取得了长沙的和平解放；有秩序地接管了城市和乡村，建立了民主政权；支援人民解放军解放了华南和西南；以及进行了剿匪、生产救灾、减租、征粮征税等项重大工作。会议同时指出了与成绩俱来的工作中的缺点和错误。会议着重指出：一年来对于恢复城乡工商业的工作做得不够。省委对工商业在湖南的重要性认识不足，而仅仅着重恢复农业生产的工作，对于工商业情况没有很好地进行调查研究，因而工作上发生不少缺点。在干部作风上存在着官僚主义和命令主义，特别是命令主义最为严重，下级干部常常采用强迫命令的方式去“完成任务”，引起群众不满。
    会议在检查全盘工作中，联系到各个人的思想作风，展开了批评和自我批评。会上，有些地委首先对自己的领导作风进行了深刻的自我检讨，清除了部分干部“整下不整上”的认识，大大地启发了干部的自我批评精神。会议在讨论工作作风中的命令主义时，曾发现一些错误的思想，但经领导干部带头检讨和互相批评后，即已纠正。例如益阳地委部分干部强调新区环境复杂、任务重、干部少和群众未发动等客观原因，认为命令主义不可避免；而不从思想作风方面去检讨。经过讨论、批评和启发后，大家才进一步地反省。一致认识到命令主义是不相信群众，不注意具体情况的个人思想作风的反映，是完全可以而且必须要克服的。
    最后，会议根据中央人民政府颁布的土地改革法和该省各地农民群众的要求以及准备工作的情况，提出了在今冬明春首先在湖南一千六百万人口的地区实行土地改革的计划，并研究了土地改革的具体步骤和有关的具体政策问题。在讨论研究当中，代表们对土地改革各项政策有了进一步的认识。现各地代表已带着会议的精神回到各地，准备把整风运动进一步深入到下级党员干部中去。
