Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch:
Nineteen years ago today – September 18, 1931, under the Kuomintang government's treasonous policy of "non-resistance," Japanese imperialism began to occupy our Northeast and launched a full-scale war of aggression against China on July 7, 1937. After eight years of bloody resistance, with the assistance of the friendly Soviet Union, the Chinese people finally defeated Japanese imperialism. However, since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War five years ago, American imperialism, which has monopolized and controlled Japan, has perfidiously violated the Potsdam Declaration and is actively supporting and arming Japanese fascist aggressive forces, plotting to use them as tools for American aggressive wars.

Since launching its war of aggression against Korea, the United States has, on the one hand, strengthened the suppression of Japanese peaceful and democratic forces, and on the other hand, intensified the arming of Japan, and the exploitation of Japanese manpower and material resources in order to carry out and expand its war of aggression. The Japanese Yoshida government fascist clique, fostered and maintained by the United States, is openly and directly serving American war policies and attempting to take the opportunity to rise again. On August 19, the Yoshida government issued a white paper on foreign policy entitled "The Korean War and Japan's Position," openly clamoring to help the United States invade Korea.

According to MacArthur's directive of July 8, the Yoshida government is actively establishing the so-called "Police Reserve Force," directly under the control of the Prime Minister, as the core of Japan's new army. This armed force, which will consist of 75,000 men, has now recruited more than 45,000, a large part of whom are fascist remnants who engaged in aggressive wars in the past. The Yoshida government has allocated a huge sum of 20 billion yen for the "Police Reserve Force's" budget for this year. The force has already received rifles and will gradually be equipped with other light and heavy weapons with the assistance of the U.S. military. As early as September 16, 1947, MacArthur ordered the increase of Japan's national and local police from 94,000 to 125,000. This Japanese armed force, likewise disguised as "police," has long been equipped with armored vehicles. Together with the so-called "Police Reserve Force," Japan's disguised active army is about to increase to 200,000 men. This situation shows that the secret memorandum proposed by Whitney, the chief of the Civil Affairs Bureau of MacArthur's headquarters, to the Yoshida government at the beginning of this year, to "reorganize" the Japanese police into an armed force of 500,000 men, is being actively implemented.

The Japanese navy is also being restored. The so-called "Maritime Safety Agency" has long been expanded to possess more than 300 ships and over 8,000 armed personnel. According to MacArthur's order of July 8, it is now doubling its strength. This institution, a disguised naval ministry, ordered the construction of 28 ships of various sizes on July 31, the largest of which has a displacement of 6,450 tons. According to Kyodo News, the agency is also planning to build five large ships of 1,200 tons, 50 patrol boats of 270 tons and 450 tons (totaling 20,000 tons), and 100 small motorboats. The recruitment of 8,000 new personnel is also actively underway. The first batch of 1,500 recruits in mid-September will receive short-term training at the "Maritime Safety School" and "Maritime Safety Training Center" in Hiroshima and Kure. At the same time, the Naval Academy will soon be revived. The so-called "Maritime Safety University," planned to be established in Tokyo, is scheduled to open on April 1 next year, enrolling 200 students. The ships of the "Maritime Safety Agency" are now openly assisting the U.S. Navy in patrolling the Korean waters.

Regarding the air force, as early as 1947, there was news that aviators from the former Japanese "Kamikaze Corps" were sent to the United States. Air force ground service personnel and radio operators were also recruited and trained by the U.S. occupation forces. In April of this year, McKent, Assistant Director of the Personnel Department of the U.S. Far East Air Force, publicly admitted that the United States is systematically training Japanese personnel serving in the U.S. Air Force. According to the New Times magazine revealed at the end of August this year, Japanese air force personnel are now engaged in aggressive activities in Korea together with U.S. air force personnel.

The war industry of the Zaibatsu group, the main pillar of Japanese aggressive forces, has been retained and supported by the United States as the "Far East Arsenal." Japan's Zaibatsu groups are now actively participating in the war of aggression against Korea. In the two months from the outbreak of the Korean War to August 28, they received 40 million U.S. dollars in military orders from the United States. A large number of wartime munitions factories are now displaying the signs of "U.S. Occupation Forces Military Supply Factories" (PD factories) and have resumed the production of military supplies. Some peaceful industries have also been converted to war industries in accordance with U.S. war preparations. For example, the Miike Dye Factory (in Omuta, Kyushu), the largest dye factory of Mitsui Chemicals, has reduced or completely stopped the production of original medicines and dyes since June or July last year, and has changed to producing explosives and other military supplies. Tubo Gu Chemical Company, after increasing its capital to 120 million yen since January last year, some of its factories stopped manufacturing dyes and produced explosive stabilizers, and some stopped manufacturing insecticides and produced explosive raw materials.

It should be emphasized that although U.S. imperialism has now openly turned the entire Japan into a war base and is strengthening the arming of Japan as an accomplice in its expanding war of aggression, the awakened Japanese people are firmly opposed to the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to drive them to destruction. The Japanese working class has launched struggles of slowdowns and strikes. Anti-war leaflets are being widely distributed, millions of people have signed peace declarations, and a great movement for peace and independence is unfolding among the patriotic people of Japan. In the face of the powerful forces of the Japanese people and the world's people, it can be asserted that the aggressive conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and their Japanese accomplices will be defeated.

### 美帝国主义武装日本侵略势力

　　美帝国主义武装日本侵略势力
    十九年前的今天——一九三一年九月十八日，日本帝国主义在国民党政府“不抵抗”的叛卖政策下，开始侵占我国东北，并于一九三七年七月七日，发动了全面的侵华战争。中国人民经过八年的浴血抗战，并在友邦苏联的援助下，终于打倒了日本帝国主义。但是，自从抗战胜利五年以来，独霸管制日本的美国帝国主义，背信弃义地破坏波茨坦宣言，竟积极扶植与武装日本法西斯侵略势力，阴谋利用它为美国侵略战争的工具。
    美国自从发动侵略朝鲜的战争以后，即一方面加强镇压日本和平民主力量，另一方面则加紧武装日本，榨取日本人力物力，以便进行并扩大侵略的战争。为美国所一手扶植豢养的日本吉田政府法西斯集团，已公开而直接地为美国战争政策服务，并力图乘机再起。八月十九日，吉田政府发表以《朝鲜战争及日本立场》为题的外交白皮书，公然叫嚣帮助美国侵略朝鲜。
    根据麦克阿瑟七月八日的指令，吉田政府正在积极建立由首相直接管辖的作为日本新陆军核心的所谓“警察后备队”。这支将由七万五千人组成的武装部队，现在已募足了四万五千名以上，其中很大一部分都是过去从事侵略战争的法西斯余孽。吉田政府已拨出二百亿日元的巨款，作为“警察后备队”今年度的经费。该队业已领到了步枪，并将在美军的援助下，逐渐装备以其他轻重武器。早在一九四七年九月十六日，麦克阿瑟就曾下令将日本的国家和地方警察，从九万四千名增至十二万五千名。这支同样以“警察”为掩盖的日本武装部队，装备早已增强到拥有装甲车。连同所谓“警察后备队”，日本变相的现役陆军，即将增至二十万人。这种情况说明，今年年初麦克阿瑟总部民政局长惠特奈向吉田政府所提出的，将日本警察“改编”为五十万人的武装部队的秘密备忘录，正在积极实行中。
    日本的海军亦在恢复中。所谓“海上保安厅”，早已扩充到拥有舰艇三百艘和武装人员八千名以上。根据麦克阿瑟七月八日的命令，它现正在加倍扩充实力。这个变相海军省的机构，已于七月三十一日订造大小舰艇二十八艘，其中最大者排水量达六千四百五十吨。据共同社透露，该厅还在计划建造一千二百吨的大型船舰五艘，二百七十吨及四百五十吨的巡逻艇五十艘（共二万吨）及发动机小艇一百艘。招募新人员八千名的工作，也在积极进行中。九月中第一批录取人员一千五百名，将在广岛和吴港的“海上保安学校”和“海上保安训练所”受短期训练。同时，海军大学也即将复活。计划设立在东京的所谓“海上保安大学”，已定于明年四月一日开学，招募学员二百名。“海上保安厅”的舰艇，现已公然帮同美国海军，在朝鲜海面担任巡逻工作。
    空军方面，早在一九四七年就有前日本“神风队”的航空员被送到美国去的消息。空军地面勤务人员及无线电员，亦早由美国占领军招募训练。今年四月间，美国驻远东空军人事处助理处长麦谦特曾公开承认：美国正在有计划地训练在美国空军中服务的日本人员。据今年八月底新时代杂志揭露，现在日本空军人员已与美国空军人员一起在朝鲜从事侵略活动。
    作为日本侵略势力主要支柱的财阀集团的战争工业，已被美国作为“远东兵工厂”而保留与扶植起来。日本的财阀集团，现在是侵略朝鲜战争的积极参与者。自朝鲜战争爆发至八月二十八日为止的两个月中，它们接受了美国四千万美元的军需订货。大批战时的军需工厂，现在都挂起“驻日占领军军需供应工厂”（ＰＤ工厂）的牌子，恢复了军事物资的生产。某些和平工业，也按照美国的备战计划，转为战争工业。例如，日本最大的染料工厂三井化学公司的三池染料工厂（在九州大牟田），自去年六、七月间起，即压缩或完全停止原来药品和染料的生产，而改变为生产炸药等军需品。土保谷化学公司，自去年一月起将资本增至一亿二千万日元后，其所属各工厂，有的停制染料而生产炸药安定剂，有的停制除虫剂而生产炸药原料。
    应当着重指出：虽然美国帝国主义现已公开将整个日本变为战争基地，并正加强武装日本，作为其扩大侵略战争的帮凶，但是，已经觉醒了的日本人民，是坚决反对美、日反动派把他们驱向毁灭的阴谋的。日本工人阶级已展开了怠工、罢工的斗争。反战传单在普遍地散发，成百万的人民在和平宣言上签了名，争取和平与独立的伟大运动，正在日本爱国人民中展开着。在强大的日本人民与世界人民力量的面前，美帝国主义者及其日本帮凶的侵略阴谋必将遭受失败，这是可以断言的。
