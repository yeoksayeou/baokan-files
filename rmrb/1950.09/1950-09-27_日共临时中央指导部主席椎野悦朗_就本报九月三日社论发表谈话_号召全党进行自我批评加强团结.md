The democratic public opinion in Japan has attached great importance to the editorial "Now is the Time for the Japanese People to Unite Against the Enemy" published in this newspaper on September 3rd. The progressive newspaper in Tokyo, "Democratic Japan," published the full translation of this editorial on September 9th, under the headline "The Japanese Communist Party is the Guiding Star of Independence, Democracy, and Peace," placing it in the most prominent position on the front page. Prior to this, Etsuro Shiina, Chairman of the Provisional Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement on this editorial after a meeting of the Japanese Communist Party Provisional Central Guidance Department held on September 5th, expressing full acceptance of the opinions of the Chinese comrades and calling on all members of the Japanese Communist Party to take this editorial as a guideline, immediately begin actions, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and strengthen unity. Shiina Etsuro's statement was published in the September 12th issue of Tokyo's "Democratic Japan." The full text is as follows:

		--Translator

On the fifth anniversary of the defeat of Japanese imperialism, the People's Daily in Beijing published an editorial entitled "Now is the Time for the Japanese People to Unite Against the Enemy." I have just read the full text of this editorial.

This editorial points out the current situation facing the Japanese people, indicates what the Japanese people should do under this situation, and discusses the issue of the unity of our party as the vanguard of the Japanese people. I accept the suggestions made by the Chinese comrades on the issue of the unity of our party with the utmost gratitude.

I hereby vow that I will definitely take responsibility to overcome certain deviations in the internal struggle within the party caused by the immaturity of the Provisional Central Guidance Department.

Comrades of the entire party should immediately begin actions and frankly accept this suggestion from the Chinese comrades. To this end, we should do the following:

	Correctly Carry Out Internal Party Struggle and Consolidate Party Organization

First, we should not merely accept this suggestion in form, but must correctly carry out the current internal party struggle to consolidate the party organization. If we only accept this suggestion in form, on the one hand, it will rashly spread the atmosphere of "'International Faction'! See, I told you so!" and on the other hand, it will be assumed that "the struggle against the splittists has come to an end," so that everything will return to its original state as if a storm has passed. The "International Faction" once wanted to accept the criticism of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau only in form. Therefore, they treated the criticism of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau in the same way as they treated the Bible. They could not apply this criticism to practice, and as a result, it became a harmful thing as the situation developed. We should not repeat this mistake now. Our attitude towards accepting the suggestions of the Chinese comrades should be: to consolidate the party organization by correctly carrying out the current internal party struggle from the standpoint of this editorial. To achieve this goal, the entire party should thoroughly discuss this editorial, and at the same time, further deepen the understanding of the decisions of the 18th and 19th Central Committee Plenums and the National Representatives Conference, as well as the appeals made to the democratic national front and the impending war crisis, and establish confidence in the correctness of these policies based on this editorial. Without this confidence, the party will not move forward.

	Should Consolidate the Revolutionary Headquarters

Second, in order to practice this correct policy and correct line, and to make the party and the people move forward, it is necessary to consolidate the various levels of organs and guidance departments of the revolutionary headquarters through the discussion of this editorial.

The emergence of the current splittists is not accidental. Because at a time when the class struggle is becoming increasingly acute, especially when the ruling class attempts to use fascist methods to make up for its own weaknesses, the petty-bourgeois elements in the party will only be confused by the phenomena of the fascists, waver, feel anxious, and commit opportunistic errors. Therefore, in order to cope with the increasingly difficult situation in the future, we should remove these petty-bourgeois wavering elements from the various levels of organs and guidance departments of the revolutionary headquarters and establish a headquarters that is more confident in shouldering the responsibility of guidance as the situation becomes more difficult. This is a prerequisite for carrying out national liberation and the people's democratic revolution.

	Do Not Relax the Pursuit of Heinous Alien Elements

Third, in order to destroy our party, the ruling class has not only carried out fascist-style suppression, but also attempted to disintegrate our party from within. For example, the sixth page of the September 2nd "Mainichi Shimbun" published a statement by President Oohashi that the Communist Party is too large, so it is difficult to make it illegal. The Japanese government is studying various measures to reduce the strength of our party.

For the unity of the party, we should not relax the pursuit of spies and villains who are connected with the enemy. For example, only by clearing from the party spies like Hideo Totsuka of Tokyo University and alien elements and careerists like Nagaji Harada of the Chugoku region (the southwestern end of Honshu, Japan, centered on Hiroshima – translator's note) can the party embark on the road of consolidation and unity. However, these spies and alien elements should be distinguished from those who are used by these elements and unconsciously assist in sabotaging the work of the party. It is our task to promote the comrades who have made such mistakes to join the revolutionary ranks. All levels of organs should open up a path for the comrades who have made such mistakes to automatically conduct self-criticism and unify to the correct policy and correct line.

	A Word to Comrades Who Have Mistakenly Committed Errors

Next, I want to advise the comrades who have mistakenly committed the errors of splitting activities.

You blindly believed the slander that the current party is a right-wing opportunist, violated the iron discipline, and engaged in activities to sabotage the correct policy and the leadership department that implements this policy. However, today, it has been clearly identified internationally who has the correct policy and the correct line. In order to shoulder the honor of being a vanguard, you should automatically take measures to unify to the correct path. And this activity is by no means an easy and flat road. Some of you, although you have been opposing the party's policies and leadership department until yesterday, scolding the leadership department as right-wing opportunists, and distributing propaganda documents containing this content, insist that "we are not opposing the policy, but only opposing the practice of the leadership department that does not listen to the opinions of the opposition, as mentioned in the latter part of the editorial"; shifting your own mistakes to the responsibility of the leadership department. However, the party's discipline does not allow this irresponsible attitude of carrying a second heart. In order to be a communist and stand on the correct position, you should do the following:

First, you should confirm the party's various decisions and policies since the 18th Central Committee Plenum. At the same time, you should expose the activities carried out to sabotage these decisions and policies, and conduct self-criticism.

Second, you should overcome the mistakes you have made with practical actions, and at the same time, be responsible for the harmful effects you have caused, take the lead in the struggle, and overcome these mistakes.

Third, you must unconditionally obey the various decisions of the Provisional Central Guidance Department and the Central Control Committee and the iron discipline of the party.

We believe that comrades such as Shiga, Miyamoto, and Kasuga, and all comrades who have engaged in splitting activities or had an impact on the split should do so. Only based on this action will the party be consolidated and unified; otherwise, it will only intensify the internal opposition and sharpen the splitting activities, creating a future legacy of misfortune. If you can expose the above points, even if you hold different opinions, we will still welcome you back to the party, stay in the party, and actively recognize your participation in the internal party struggle.

	A Word to Comrades Who Have Been Disciplined Only Because of Differences of Opinion

Finally, I must advise those comrades who, although they obey the party's various decisions and strictly abide by the party's discipline, have been disciplined only because of differences of opinion.

The Provisional Central Guidance Department and the Control Committee have repeatedly stated that differences of opinion cannot be a reason for punishing party members. However, we have received some reports that the following organs have indeed taken such disciplinary actions because of our insufficient leadership and sectarianism. This responsibility should of course be borne by the Provisional Central Guidance Department and the Control Committee, with me at the center.

Regarding this point, in addition to conducting heartfelt self-criticism, we also hope that you will immediately submit an application requesting the withdrawal of the inappropriate disciplinary action you have received.

	Do Not Hesitate! But Move Forward!

Comrades of the entire party! If we can accept the suggestions of the Chinese comrades and correctly carry out the internal party struggle, we will be able to remove the selfishness that exists in the party, and at the same time, we will be able to establish a party style that truly serves the people, and complete the unity of unconditionally obeying the iron discipline in order to establish this party style. Only this kind of unity can cope with the development of the situation that is about to come. We should complete this task.

As the Chinese comrades said, today the entire Asian people are waging a struggle against imperialism like a raging fire. And we are also in a situation that does not allow for a moment's pause. Hesitation is the road to destruction. The entire party should unite on the correct road, move forward, and complete the task.

Only in this way can the Japanese people and the entire Asian people open up a bright future, and only in this way can we repay the good-intentioned admonition of the Chinese comrades.

Do not hesitate! If there are mistakes, they should be corrected, if there are defects, they must be overcome, link arms tightly, and move forward! Meet the fascist storm head-on, and raise the banner forward!

专栏：

　　日共临时中央指导部主席椎野悦朗
    就本报九月三日社论发表谈话
    号召全党进行自我批评加强团结
    日本民主舆论对于本报九月三日发表的社论《现在是日本人民团结对敌的时候》一文甚为重视。东京的进步报纸《民主日本》，曾于九月九日在该报头版第一条地位，以《日本共产党是独立、民主主义及和平的导星》为标题，登出这篇社论全文的译文。在这之前，日本共产党中央临时指导部主席椎野悦朗，在九月五日召开的日本共产党临时中央指导部会议之后，特就此社论发表谈话，表示完全接受中国同志的意见，号召日共全体党员以此社论为准绳，立即开始行动，进行批评与自我批评，加强团结。椎野悦朗谈话登载于九月十二日的东京《民主日本》，全文如下：
                ——译者
    打垮日本帝国主义五周年纪念日，北京人民日报以《现在是日本人民团结对敌的时候》为题，发表了社论。我刚刚读到这篇社论的全文。
    这篇社论指出日本人民大众目前所面临的情势，同时指示日本人民大众处在这种情势下应做的事情，并论及作为日本人民的前卫的我党的统一问题。我以最感激的心情，接受中国同志们对我党的统一问题所提出的建议。
    我特此誓言，我必定负起责任，克服由于临时中央指导部的不够成熟而引起的党内斗争的某些偏向。
    全党的同志们，应该马上开始行动，坦率地接受中国同志们的这个建议。为此，我们应该做到下列各点：
  正确地开展党内斗争，巩固党的组织
    第一，不应该仅在形式上接受这个建议，而必须正确地开展目前的党内斗争，以求巩固党的组织。如果我们仅从形式上去接受这个建议，一方面会轻率地散布“‘国际派’！你瞧吧！”的空气，另一方面也会以为“与分裂派的斗争已告结束”，以致如同一阵暴风雨过去一般，一切回复到原来的状态去。“国际派”曾经想只在形式上接受共产党与工人党情报局的批评。因此，他们便用处理圣经的方式来处理共产党与工人党情报局的批评，他们不能把这个批评适用于实践上，结果在情势发展时反而变成了一种有害的东西。现在不应该重复这种错误了。我们接受中国同志们的建议的态度，应该是：以站在这篇社论的立场上正确地开展目前的党内斗争来巩固党的组织为目的。为了达到这个目的，全党应该彻底讨论这篇社论，同时并进一步深刻地理解党第十八、第十九次中全会和全国代表会议的决定，以及对民主民族战线与面临战争危机所作的呼吁，并以这篇社论为立足点，建立起对这些方针的正确性的信心。如果没有这种信心，就不会使党前进。
  应该巩固革命司令部
    第二，为了实践这个正确的方针和正确的路线，使党和人民前进，必需通过对这篇社论的讨论，巩固革命的司令部的各级机关及指导部。
    目前的分裂主义者的产生，并非偶然。因为在阶级斗争日趋尖锐化的时候，尤其统治阶级妄图用法西斯的方法来弥补自己的弱点的时候，党内的小资产阶级分子就只会被法西斯蒂的现象所困惑，发生动摇，感到焦急不安，犯了机会主义的错误。因此，我们为了应付今后将日趋困难的情势，应该从革命的司令部的各级机关及指导部中清除这种小资产阶级的动摇分子，建立一个情势越困难却越有信心负起指导责任的司令部。这是进行民族解放和人民民主主义革命的前提条件。
  不要放松对凶恶的异己分子的追究
    第三，统治阶级为了破坏我党，非但进行了法西斯式的弹压，而且妄图从内部瓦解我党。如九月二日的《每日新闻》第六版，曾登载大桥法总裁的谈话称：共产党太庞大，因此很难使它变成非法化。日本政府正在研究各种措置，借以减少我党的势力。
    为了党的统一，我们不应该放松对那些与敌人有联系的奸细和凶徒的追究。例如，从党内清除像东京大学的户冢秀夫之流的奸细和中国地方（日本本州西南端，以广岛为中心的地方——译者注）的原田长司之流的异己分子、野心家等，才能使党走上巩固和统一的道路。只是应该把这些奸细及异己分子和那些受这些分子的利用而不自觉地协助破坏党的工作的人分别开来。促使犯了这种错误的同志加入革命行列是我们的任务。各级机关应该开辟一条道路，使犯了这种错误的同志，自动地展开自我批评，统一到正确的方针和正确的路线方面来。
  告误犯错误的同志们
    其次，我要忠告误犯分裂活动的错误的同志们。
    你们盲目地相信诬蔑目前的党是右翼机会主义者的谰言，违犯了铁的纪律，并为破坏正确的方针和执行这个方针的指导部而从事活动。然而，在今天，已从国际上明确了谁是正确的方针和正确的路线。为了担负起作为一个前卫者的荣誉，你们应该自动地采取措施，以求统一到正确的道路上来。而这种活动决不是一条易走的坦道。你们当中的有一部分人，虽然一直到昨天为止，还在反对党的政策和指导部，指骂指导部为右翼机会主义者，并散发了包含这种内容的宣传文件，却硬说“我们并不是反对政策，只是如社论的后端所说，仅反对不听反对派的意见的指导部的作法而已”；将自己的错误转移到指导部的责任上去。然而，党的纪律是不允许这种不负责任的携贰态度的。为了要作为一个共产主义者，并站在正确的立场上，你们应该做到：
    第一，应该确认自第十八次中央全会以后党的各种决定和各种方针。同时并应该暴露为了破坏这些决定和方针所进行的活动，进行自我批评。
    第二，应该用实际行动去克服所犯的错误，同时应对自己所引起的有害的影响负责，以身作则，进行斗争，克服这些错误。
    第三，必须无条件服从临时中央指导部及中央统制委员会的各种决定和党的铁的纪律。
    我们认为如志贺，宫本，春日等同志，进行了分裂活动或对分裂起了影响的所有同志们应该这样做。只有基于这种行动，党才会巩固地统一起来；否则定将使党内更加对立，并使分裂活动更加尖锐，造成一个贻祸将来的结局。如果你们能暴露出上述各点，纵令你们抱有不同的意见，我们仍将欢迎你们回到党内，留在党内，并积极承认你们参加党内斗争。
  告仅因意见的不同而受了处分的同志们
    最后，我得忠告那些虽然服从党的各种决定，严守党的纪律，却只因意见的不同而受了处分的同志们。
    临时中央指导部和统制委员会曾屡次重复表明，意见的不同不能成为处罚党员的理由。然而，我们却接到一些报告，知道下面的机关，确实曾因为我们的指导力不够和宗派性，采取了这种处分。这种责任，当然应该由以我为中心的临时中央指导部和统制委员会来担负。
    关于这一点，我们除进行由衷的自我批评之外，同时希望你们马上提出申请，要求撤回你们所受的这种不恰当的处分。
  不要踌躇！而要前进！
    全体党员同志们！如果我们能接受中国同志们的建议，正确地开展党内斗争，我们必能除去党内所存在的利己心，同时也能建立真正为人民服务的党风，完成为建立这种党风而无条件地服从铁的纪律的统一。只有这种统一才能够应付即将到来的情势的发展。我们应该完成这个任务。
    如同中国的同志们所说的，今天整个亚洲人民，正对帝国主义进行着如烈火一般的斗争。而我们也处于不容许有片刻停歇的情势之中。踌躇就是走到毁灭的道路。全党应该团结在正确的道路上，向前迈进，完成任务。
    只有这样，日本人民和整个亚洲人民才能开辟出光明的前途，才能报答中国同志们的好意的忠言。
    不要踌躇！有错误应该改过，有缺陷必须克服，挽紧臂膀，向前迈进！迎头冲击法西斯的暴风雨，高举旗帜前进吧！
              （康大川译）
