　　Do It Yourself, Equip Yourself!
    ——A Record of the Artillery-Searching Hero Zhou Tiancai
    Zhong Gan
    In the deep mountains and dense forests and the icy and snowy land of North Manchuria, Comrade Zhou Tiancai led his troops to search for artillery abandoned by the Japanese invaders to equip themselves.
    When we mention the construction of the artillery of the Fourth Field Army, we will remember such a heroic figure: he once led a company and collected more than 20 artillery pieces abandoned by the Japanese invaders in the deep mountains and dense forests and the icy and snowy land of North Manchuria for 60 consecutive days and nights, equipping nearly a regiment of heavy artillery. His name is closely linked to the construction of Northeast artillery. This is Comrade Zhou Tiancai, the "Artillery-Searching Hero" who was elected to attend the National Model Hero Representative Conference.
    Comrade Zhou Tiancai is now the Deputy Chief of the Security Section of the Political Department of a certain artillery division. At the beginning of the Northeast Liberation War, he was the company commander of the Second Company of the Third Artillery Regiment. At that time, the Kuomintang bandit army was launching a frenzied offensive against the liberated areas with full American equipment and heavy artillery. But at that time, our artillery was so weak! Not to mention heavy artillery, even ordinary artillery was very scarce. The Second Company led by Zhou Tiancai didn't even have a single piece of artillery. The soldiers were anxious when they saw other companies marching to the front to fight, while they squatted in the rear for rectification, saying: "What kind of battle can our artillery fight without artillery!"
    In the winter of 1947, due to the development of the war situation, the higher-ups decided to equip the Third Regiment into a heavy artillery regiment, but the only source of artillery was to collect various artillery pieces abandoned by the Japanese invaders. This was an arduous task. In those years, the Japanese invaders' defense lines were all set up in the deep mountains and dense forests on the border, which had always been a place rarely visited. Moreover, at this time, it was sealed off by thousands of miles of ice and snow, making it really difficult to find these artillery pieces.
    Comrade Zhou Tiancai led the Second Company and bravely accepted this task. They put forward the slogan: "Equip ourselves by doing it ourselves!" After a few days of preparation and mobilization, the entire company was divided into four routes and set off for Jixi, Suifenhe, Mudanjiang and other places close to the border. He personally led two platoons as one route to Muling County. Comrade Zhou Tiancai suffered from severe stomach problems and was very weak due to the Long March and the War of Resistance Against Japan. Before departure, the higher-ups and comrades were worried about his health and advised him not to go, but he insisted on his own opinion. He knew that the Party had entrusted him with an important task, and he disregarded his sick body and set off with the team.
    In November, North Manchuria was a world of ice and snow. After learning about the situation in Muling County, they went into the deep mountains. On the first day, they trudged through two or three feet of snow all day and walked forty or fifty miles, without seeing even a shadow of artillery. Later, they couldn't even tell the direction. The soldiers were tired and hungry, and many lost heart, saying: "Let's call it a day, go back today, and come again tomorrow!" Comrade Zhou Tiancai endured his hunger and fatigue and said to everyone: "Our mission is to come out and find artillery to equip ourselves. We will never turn back until we see the artillery!" He stepped on the ice and snow and took the lead in walking into the deep mountains. Encouraged by him, the soldiers continued to move forward. For more than twenty consecutive days, they traveled from the Tumen River to the Heilongjiang River, searching every forest in the uninhabited deep mountains, resisting the cold and the invasion of wild animals, enduring fatigue and hunger, and finally, under the seal of ice and snow, they discovered more than ten artillery pieces and countless parts, completing the first step of the artillery-searching task.
    The second step was to transport the artillery and parts that had been found back. This was an even more arduous task. Each artillery piece weighed tens of thousands of pounds, and even each part weighed one or two thousand pounds. How difficult it was to transport such heavy artillery hundreds of miles away! He led the soldiers to first dig out the artillery frozen in the ice and snow with picks, then disassemble the entire artillery piece by piece and move it down the mountain to load it on trucks and transport it away. In the dismantling process, he cherished the artillery like his own life. He knew that with it, he could build a strong artillery force and defeat any crazy enemy. He told the soldiers that every part on the artillery was precious, and even a screw was not allowed to be lost. Under his call, the soldiers found thousands of parts belonging to the artillery from under several feet of snow, from large ammunition carts to small "boards" and "starters," and were unwilling to leave out a single one. In the hard life and tense work, he used his exemplary actions to encourage the soldiers' morale and confidence. In order to transport the artillery away quickly, he led the soldiers to live on the mountain, working all day and sleeping in the snow at night. The soldiers saw that the company commander was weak and asked him to live in a small charcoal kiln on the mountain, but he gave it to the sick comrades and still slept outside. He was so cold at night that he couldn't sleep, so they got up to make a fire. They could only sleep four or five hours a day. Many soldiers wore out their clothes and shoes at work, and some had frostbite on their hands and feet. He mobilized the cadres to take off their clothes and shoes and give them to the soldiers. Although he himself had severe stomach problems, he ate frozen cornbread like the soldiers every day. As a result, he had stomach pain and fever almost every day, but he still insisted on working. His exemplary actions not only educated the soldiers, but also moved the civilians who helped transport the artillery. They said: "The People's Liberation Army is really a good team that serves the people!"
    Zhou Tiancai and his entire company fought for sixty days and nights in the deep mountains and dense forests sealed by ice and snow, and searched for a total of 23 artillery pieces and more than 11,000 various parts. At the celebration meeting, he won the glorious title of "Artillery-Searching Hero," and the entire company also won the honor of "Artillery-Searching Model Company." At this time, under his promotion, a warm artillery-searching movement was set off in the entire artillery force. Hundreds of artillery pieces were searched on the thousands of miles of border line from Manzhouli to Suifenhe, and a powerful artillery force was built in the Northeast. In the past two years, this artillery force has fought all the way from the Northeast to the South China Sea, and now it has become an iron force with unparalleled power. (Attached picture)

　　自己动手，装备自己！
    ——记搜炮英雄周天才
    中干
    在北满的深山密林和冰天雪地里，周天才同志带着他的部队搜寻日寇遗弃的大炮来装备自己。
    提起第四野战军炮兵的建设，我们便会记起这样一个英雄人物：他曾带领一个连，在北满的深山密林和冰天雪地里，连续六十昼夜搜集到日寇遗弃的大炮二十余门，装备了将近一个团的重炮，他的名字和东北炮兵的建设是紧密的联系着，这就是这次当选为出席全国英模代表会议的“搜炮英雄”周天才同志。
    周天才同志现在是炮兵某师政治部保卫科副科长，东北解放战争开始时，他在炮三团二连当连长。当时国民党匪军带着全副的美式装备和重炮，向解放区进行着疯狂的进攻。而当时我们的炮兵是多么弱小啊！不要说重炮，就连普通的炮也很少。周天才所领导的二连就连一门炮都没有。战士们看到别连出发向前方打仗，自己蹲在后方整训，都着急地说：“咱们炮兵没有炮打啥仗啊！”
    一九四七年冬天，由于战争形势的发展，上级决定把三团装备成重炮团，但是炮的来源却只有靠搜集日寇遗弃的各种大炮来装备。这是一个艰巨的任务，当年日寇的防线都是设在国境上的深山密林间，这里一向都是人迹罕到的地方，况且这时又被千里冰雪封住，寻找这些大炮的确是困难的。
    周天才同志率领着二连，勇敢的接受了这个任务，他们提出口号：“自己动手装备自己！”经过短短几天的准备和动员，全连就分成四路向靠近国境的鸡西、绥芬河、牡丹江等地出发了。他亲自带领两个班作为一路到穆棱县去。周天才同志由于经过两万五千里长征和抗日战争等多年的斗争，得了很严重的胃病，身体很弱。在出发前上级和同志们担心他的身体，劝他不要去，但是他坚持着自己的意见，他知道这次党交给他的是一个重大的任务，他顾不得自己多病的身体，便带着队伍出发了。
    十一月间，北满是个冰雪的世界。在穆棱县了解了情况之后，他们就向深山中走去，第一天在二、三尺深的雪地里跋涉了整天，走了四、五十里路，连个炮的影子都没有看到，后来连方向也分辨不出来，战士们走得又累又饿，很多人泄了气，说：“算了吧，今天回去，明天再来！”周天才同志忍住了饥饿和疲劳对大家说：“我们的任务是出来找炮装备自己，不见炮坚决不回头！”他踏着冰雪首先向深山里走去，在他的鼓舞下战士们又继续前进。一连二十多天，他们从图们江到黑龙江，走遍了无人的深山，搜寻了每一座森林，抵抗着寒冷和野兽的侵袭，忍着疲劳和饥饿，终于在冰雪的封蔽下，发现了十余门大炮和无数的零件，完成了第一步的搜炮任务。
    第二步是要把已经找到的大炮和零件运回去。这是个更加艰巨的工作，每门炮都有万把斤重，甚至每个零件都有一、二千斤重，要把这样重的炮运到几百里路以外，是一件多么困难的事情啊！他带着战士，首先把冻在冰雪里的大炮用镐刨出来，再把整个的炮拆卸开，一件件搬到山下装车运走。在拆卸中他爱护炮像自己的生命一样，他知道有了它就能建设一支强大的炮兵，能战胜任何疯狂的敌人。他告诉战士们说：炮上的每一个零件都是宝贵的，甚至连一个螺丝钉都不准丢掉。在他的号召下，战士们从几尺深的雪下找出了数千件属于炮上的零件，从大的弹药车到小的“板子”和“起子”，一件都不肯漏掉。在艰苦的生活和紧张的工作中，他以自己的模范行动来鼓舞战士的情绪和信心，为了把炮赶快运走，他带着战士们住到山上，白天工作一天，晚上就在雪地里睡觉。战士们看连长身体弱，叫他住在山上的一个烧炭的小窑里，但是他把它让给有病的同志，自己仍然睡在外面，晚上冻得睡不着，他们就起来烤火，每天只能睡眠四五小时。很多战士在工作中把衣服磨烂了，鞋子磨破了，有的把手脚冻伤，他就动员干部把衣服和鞋子脱下来给战士穿。他自己虽然有严重的胃病，每天却和战士一样的啃着冰冻的窝窝，这样他差不多每天都要胃痛发烧，但仍然坚持工作。他的模范行动不仅教育了战士，并且也感动了帮助运炮的民夫，他们说：“解放军真是为人民服务的好队伍！”
    周天才和他的全连在冰雪封蔽的深山密林中奋斗了六十昼夜，前后共搜寻到大炮二十三门，各种零件一万一千多件。在庆功大会上，他获得了“搜炮英雄”的光荣称号，全连也得到了“搜炮模范连”的荣誉。这时在他的推动下，在整个炮兵部队中掀起了热烈的搜炮运动，从满洲里到绥芬河的数千里国境线上，一共搜到了数百门大炮，建设了东北的强大炮兵部队。两年来，这支炮兵部队从东北一直打到南海边，现在它已经成为一支具有无比威力的钢铁的力量。（附图片）
