　　Model Industrial Representatives of the Capital
    ——Introduction to Industrial Representatives at the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Peasants and Soldiers, No. 5
    Hou Deyuan is the designer of the "Eight-Eight" type long-distance line crossover program. The success of this line design is a glory for the Chinese academic community and saved the country a large amount of expenses.
    In the past, the long-distance line crossover programs used in our country were partly the American-designed "K Eight" type crossover, using ten-wire wooden crossarms. Our country used eight-wire wooden crossarms. Part of it was the Japanese-style crossover, which could not install carrier wave machines on each pair of lines, and was not suitable for application in China. Therefore, the problem of crosstalk was very serious, and the call efficiency was very low. After Hou Deyuan's "Eight-Eight" type design was successful, the National Long-Distance Telecommunications Engineering Conference decided to adopt it universally throughout the country. As a result of the adoption, not only was the crosstalk rate reduced by 30% compared with the "K Eight" type, but also a large amount of various materials and manpower could be saved. For example, in this year alone, the construction of lines nationwide saved the country more than 947,400 jin of millet in H-shaped steel plates alone. In addition, each pair of lines in the "Eight-Eight" type crossover can handle three channels of carrier wave telephone; there are two sets of designs, one for busy trunk lines and the other for less busy lines; each set also has long and short zones, which can be matched for different lengths of distances. These are all things that other crossover methods cannot do.
    Engineer Hou Deyuan is from Taixian County, Jiangsu Province. He graduated from the Department of Telecommunications Engineering of Shanghai Jiaotong University and studied telecommunications business abroad. He is currently the Deputy Director of the Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
    Liu Dezhen is a technician at the steam turbine shop of Shijingshan Power Plant. With the help of Soviet engineers, he led everyone to overcome many difficulties and repaired the No. 6 generator, which had the largest load in Guannei. This steam turbine had not generated electricity for five and a half months due to damage, and the loss of electricity alone was 22.2 million jin of millet. After the repair, the lighting and industrial electricity consumption of the capital was guaranteed. His team learned from the experience of the Northeast Ma Hengchang team and won the red flag of the advanced team in the steam turbine shop. Since he took office as the team leader, the average completion rate of tasks from May to August was 163.6%, and the quality was all up to specifications. The team also established production charts, technical research, and production review meetings.
    Liu Dezhen is a member of the Communist Party of China and is now the secretary of the Party branch of the steam turbine shop. The steam turbine shop branch he leads is the best branch in the entire factory, and the trade union is also a model workshop committee, which has ensured that no major accidents have occurred in the steam turbine shop for three months, and has won the trade union's "Accident-Free Pioneer" red flag three times in a row.
    In his daily work, due to his careful inspection and research, he discovered many hidden accidents, ensuring the safe operation of the steam turbine. He has put forward seven major rationalization proposals.
    He fully demonstrated the heroic spirit of not fearing sacrifice for the country's construction cause in his work. In June of this year, he was suffering from dysentery, but as soon as he heard that the main steam valve pad of Unit 6 was leaking steam, he immediately entered the factory and insisted on working for nine hours in a high temperature of 70 degrees, completing the original five days of work in one day. In August, the Yongding River flooded and collapsed the embankment. After hearing about it, he ran to the scene and led everyone to build a new embankment in the flood, protecting the power plant.
    Li Shuhe is a coal mining expert in the Jingxi Mining Area and a special-class model worker of the Jingxi Coal Mine Company. He has three major characteristics in his work: first, he is active in his work and has good coal mining skills underground; second, he cares about the safety of his fellow workers; third, he is not conservative in his skills and unites his fellow workers to learn well.
    When Li Shuhe leads his fellow workers into the mine, he carefully checks the work surface before each job, seriously hands over the shift, and always pays attention to the changes in the roof and walls. Under the leadership of Li Shuhe, the average coal mining rate of his group is one-quarter higher than the general level of the mine, and he has created the highest rock tunneling record in the Jingxi Mining Area. In the sixteen months after liberation, none of the thirty-eight members of his coal mining team were injured or killed. Workers without skills have acquired skills. Now, thirty-two people have been promoted from small workers to large workers, two people have been promoted to technicians, and one person has been promoted to foreman, which has cultivated a group of valuable production forces for the country.
    Li Jinquan is an electric welder at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. His unyielding research spirit moved everyone. Even those who had obstructed and attacked him in the past cannot help but secretly admire and learn from him today.
    In April of last year, Li Jinquan saw many welding rods piled up in the warehouse, exposed to wind and rain, and the welding flux was gone. He felt heartbroken and wanted to make good use of these waste welding rods, so he was determined to study making welding rods himself.
    At first, he was afraid of being laughed at by others if his research failed, so he always did it quietly and made up his mind not to spend a penny from the factory before the research was successful. He did the experiments after get off work to avoid delaying production. There were no tea bowls at home, but a lot of bottles and cans, containing more than 30 kinds of chemicals. All these chemicals were bought at his own expense. He only asked the factory for four bottles of water glass and less than one pound of yellow blood salt and other very few materials.
    When the news that he was researching welding rods spread throughout the factory, some workers encouraged him, while others said sarcastically behind his back: "If rabbits can pull big carts, why buy mules and horses?" At the team meeting, some people criticized him for being "meritorious." The administration of the forging and welding workshop did not provide enough help to him, and the trade union did not pay much attention to it at that time. Except for individual talks with him, the Party branch did not provide any concrete help. When he was angry outside and heard strange things, he wanted to smash those bottles, but his wife persuaded him: "Are you getting angry with them or with the factory?" Li Jinquan cheered up again and continued his research. In this way, he stubbornly and silently studied for a year and finally succeeded.
    He successfully researched three types of welding rods: mild steel welding rods, cast iron welding rods, and steel welding rods. Among them, the mild steel welding rods are slightly worse than the Japanese-made ones, but much better than the Northeast-made ones, and the price is more than half cheaper than the Japanese-made ones. Judging from the utilization of more than three tons of waste welding rods in the factory alone, it saved more than 28,000 jin of millet. Now he is further studying aluminum welding rods and is also preparing to study other metal welding rods, such as copper, white steel, and air steel welding rods.
    Li Jinquan has not only made great contributions to the research of welding rods, but also has been working selflessly as always. Last summer, the light oil tanks in the welding coke oil yard were so hot that they were scalding to the touch. Others had to take turns welding in pairs, and had to come out after ten minutes, but Li Jinquan went in alone and worked for half a day in a row. His sweat blurred his eyes, but he still insisted on working. He is also very modest and often looks for people to study together, and pays special attention to training his two young apprentices.
    Li Jinquan is an electric welder with more than 20 years of experience, who has suffered the pain of unemployment and homelessness in the past. Only after liberation was he freed from the persecution in life and politics, and under the education and cultivation of the Communist Party, his class consciousness was raised, thus giving him infinite strength.
    His contribution is not only in saving tens of thousands of jin of millet for the factory, but more importantly, his research spirit and arduous and continuous struggle process typically illustrate that the working class after liberation can overcome any difficulties. At the same time, he used practical actions to educate a few backward elements, educated administrative staff, and set a good example for workers.

　　首都工业劳模代表
    ——工农兵劳模大会工业代表介绍之五
    侯德原是“八八”式长途线路交叉程式的设计者。这种线路设计的成功，是中国学术界的光荣，给国家节省了一大批费用。
    过去我国采用的长途线路交叉程式，一部分是美国人设计的“Ｋ八”式交叉，是用十线木担，我国是采用八线木担，一部分是日本式的交叉，不能每对线装通载波机，都不适合中国应用，因此，通话串线的毛病很大，通话效率也很低。侯德原的“八八”式设计成功后，全国长途电信工务会议就决定全国普遍采用。采用结果，不单使通话串线率较“Ｋ八”式减低了百分之三十，而且能够大量地节约各种器材和人力。例如在今年一年当中，全国建设的线路，仅仅Ｈ形钢板一项，就给国家省下九十四万七千四百多斤小米。此外，如“八八”式交叉每一对线都可通三路载波电话；有两套设计，一套应用于业务较忙的干线上，另一套可应用于业务较空闲的路线上；每套又有长短区各种，对于不同长度的距离，都可以配合应用，这都是其他交叉方式所不及的。
    侯德原工程师系江苏泰县人，曾在上海交大电信工程系学习毕业，并曾在国外钻研电信业务，现为邮电部长途电信总局副局长。
    刘德珍石景山发电厂汽机场技工。他曾在苏联工程师的帮助下，带动大家克服重重困难，修好关内负荷最大的六号发电机。这个汽机因为损毁，有五个半月没发电，单单电字损失就有二千二百万斤小米。修好以后，就保证了首都的照明和工业用电。他领导的小组学习了东北马恒昌小组经验，荣获汽机场先进小组的红旗。从他担任小组长以来，五月至八月平均完成任务百分之一百六十三点六，且质量全部合乎规格。小组并建立了生产图表，研究技术和生产检讨会等制度。
    刘德珍是中共党员，现在是发电厂汽机场党支部书记。他领导的汽机场支部是全厂最好的支部，工会也是模范的车间委员会，保证了汽机场三个月未发生重要事故，连获工会“无事故先锋”红旗三次。
    在日常工作中，由于他的细心检查和钻研，发现许多隐形事故，保证了汽机运行的安全。他提出的重大合理化建议就有七项。
    他在工作中充分表现了为祖国建设事业不怕牺牲自己的英勇精神，今年六月，他正患赤痢，但一听说六号机大汽门垫跑汽，立刻进厂冒着七十度高温坚持九小时工作，把原来五天工作一天干完。八月份永定河水冲塌岸堤，他听说后就跑去，在洪水中带动大家堵起新堤，保护了发电厂。
    李书和是京西矿区采煤能手，京西煤矿公司的特等模范。他在工作上有三大特点：一是工作积极，井下采煤技术好；二是关心工友们的安全好；三是有技术不保守，团结工友学习好。
    李书和领着工友下井时，每一次工作前都对工作面细心检查，认真交接班，时刻注意顶帮的变化。在李书和领导下，他组每人平均采煤率比该矿一般水平高四分之一，并创造京西矿区岩石掘进最高纪录。在解放后的十六个月中，他的采煤班三十八人无一伤亡，没技术的工人有了技术，现已有三十二人由小工升为大工，二人升为技工，一人升为班长，为国家培养了一批宝贵的生产力量。
    李金泉是石景山钢铁厂的电焊工人。他的不屈不挠的研究精神，感动了大家，就是过去曾经阻挠过他打击过他的人，今天也不能不暗暗地佩服他，学习他。
    去年四月李金泉看见仓库里堆了许多焊条，风吹雨淋，焊药都没了，他感到心痛，想要把这些废焊条好好利用起来，于是便下决心研究自制焊条。
    起初，他为了怕研究不成遭别人笑话，总是自己悄悄的干，并且打定主意，在研究成功以前，绝不花工厂一个钱。他作试验都在下班以后，免得耽误生产。家里连茶碗都没有，但是瓶子罐子一大堆，装着三十多种化学药品。这些药品，全部是他自己花钱买的。向工厂只要过四瓶水玻璃和不到一磅的黄血盐等极少的材料。
    当他研究焊条的消息传到全厂以后，有的工人鼓励他，有的却在背后说闲话：“兔子要能拉大车，还买大骡子大马干啥？”小组会上有人批评他是“功劳主义”。锻焊场行政上对他的帮助也很不够，工会当时也不怎么管这事，党支部除和他个别谈谈外，也没有什么具体帮助。他在外面受了气，听了怪话，回去就想摔掉那些瓶子，他的老婆就劝说他：“你这是和他们呕气，还是和工厂呕气？”李金泉便又振作起来，继续研究下去。就这样，他顽强的默默的钻研了一年，终于成功了。
    他研究成功软钢焊条、生铁焊条、钢焊条三种。其中软钢焊条虽然比日本制的稍差，比东北制的就好多了，而且价钱比日制的便宜一半以上。单从利用该厂的三吨多废焊条算来，就节省了二万八千多斤小米。现在他正在进一步研究铝焊条，还准备研究其他金属焊条，如铜、白钢、风钢焊条等。
    李金泉不仅在研究焊条上有巨大的贡献，在平常他就是一贯忘我地工作着。去年夏天，焊焦油场的轻油罐，铁罐热得烫手，别人是两人替换着焊，进去十分钟就得出来，但李金泉一个人一钻进去就连干半天，汗水把眼都迷糊了，他还是坚持着工作。他还非常虚心，常常找人一块研究，对他的两个青年学徒更是注意的培养。
    李金泉是一个二十多年的电焊工，过去受尽了失业流浪的痛苦。只是在解放以后才解除了生活上和政治上的被迫害，在共产党的教育培养下提高了阶级的自觉性，因而给了他无穷的力量。
    他的贡献不只是在他为工厂省了几万斤小米上面，更重要的，是他的研究精神和艰苦，不断的斗争过程，典型的说明了翻身后的工人阶级能够克服任何困难。同时，他用实际的行动，教育了少数落后分子，教育了行政人员，为工人树立了一个很好的榜样。
