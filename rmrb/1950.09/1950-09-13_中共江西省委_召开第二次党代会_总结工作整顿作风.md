　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 10th: The Second Party Congress of the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Committee utilized work summaries, situation analyses, and the unfolding of criticism and self-criticism to conduct rectification, achieving good results. On this basis, it discussed and determined the direction of the Jiangxi Party's work for the next two years, as well as specific tasks from now until the spring plowing of next year.

　　The conference was held from August 3rd to 21st, attended by 261 people, including all members of the Provincial Committee, secretaries of Party committees at the county level and above, and Party member representatives from the military, government, and people's organizations. Li Xuefeng, representative of the Central China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, also attended the meeting to provide guidance.

　　The first eleven days of the meeting were devoted to reviewing and summarizing the Party's major work in Jiangxi since its liberation a year ago. This review and summary was conducted after studying Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session. The meeting considered that great achievements had been made in various urban and rural works over the past year. The meeting also reviewed some shortcomings and errors that had come with the achievements in the past year. The meeting focused on reviewing rural work since this spring. The meeting pointed out that the revolutionary order in some rural areas of Jiangxi was once insufficiently stable this spring. The meeting believed that the reasons were, on the one hand, the sabotage by Kuomintang agents, bandits, and reactionaries from the landlord class, and on the other hand, some shortcomings in the work (such as the phenomenon of disproportionate grain requisitioning), serious commandism in the style of cadres, and phenomena such as indiscriminate beatings and arrests, which more or less gave the enemy opportunities to act. In response, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee first made self-criticism, reviewing some of its blindness in implementing policies and its bureaucratic style of leadership. Under the exemplary leadership of the Provincial Committee, the meeting widely unfolded self-criticism and criticism. Each delegation successively reviewed the shortcomings in the implementation of policies in various regions, specifically analyzed the class relations in various regions, summarized the experiences and lessons of the spring work based on the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the CCP Central Committee, and strictly criticized the bad work style and illegal behavior of some cadres in indiscriminately beating and arresting people.

　　Finally, the meeting, in accordance with the instructions of the higher-level Party committee and combined with the current specific situation in Jiangxi Province, passed a resolution to struggle for the completion of land reform and production and construction tasks in the next two years. The meeting considered that land reform should be implemented in areas with 50% of the rural population from this autumn to the spring plowing of next year; other areas should concentrate their efforts on continuing the rent reduction movement, further mobilizing the masses, and creating conditions for the implementation of land reform after the autumn of next year.

　　中共江西省委
    召开第二次党代会  总结工作整顿作风
    【新华社南昌十日电】中共江西省第二次党代表会议，用总结工作、分析情况，展开批评与自我批评的方法进行了整风，收到良好效果；并在这一基础上，讨论和确定了江西全党今后两年的工作方向和从现在到明年春耕前的具体工作任务。
    会议在八月三日至二十一日举行，出席省委会全体委员、县以上各级党委书记以及军队、政府、人民团体中党员代表共二百六十一名。中共中央中南局代表李雪峰亦莅会指导。
    会议的前十一天，检查和总结了党在江西解放一年来的各项主要工作。这种检查和总结是在学习了毛主席在三中全会的报告之后进行的。会议认为：一年来城乡各项工作成绩很大。会议同时检讨了一年来工作中随成绩而来的若干缺点和错误。会议着重检查了自今春以来的农村工作。会议指出：今春江西部分农村的革命秩序曾一度不够稳定。会议认为：其原因一方面是由于国民党特务、土匪和地主阶级中的反动分子进行破坏，另一方面也由于工作中存在着某些缺点（如征粮工作中的畸轻畸重现象）和干部作风上的严重命令主义以及乱打乱押等现象，或多或少的给予敌人以活动的机会。对此，江西省委首先作了自我批评，检讨了省委在执行政策上的某些盲目性和领导作风上的官僚主义的毛病。会议在省委带头示范下广泛地展开了自我批评和批评，各个代表团都相继检讨了各地执行政策中的缺点，并具体分析了各地的阶级关系，依据中共中央三中全会报告的精神，总结了春季工作中的经验和教训，严格批判了某些干部乱打人、乱押人的不良作风和违法行为。
    最后，会议根据上级党委指示，并结合江西省当前具体情况，通过了今后两年为完成土地改革与生产建设任务而斗争的决议。会议认为：今年秋后到明年春耕前，在农村百分之五十人口的地区实行土地改革；其他地区则集中力量继续进行减租运动，进一步发动群众，为明年秋后实行土地改革创造条件。
