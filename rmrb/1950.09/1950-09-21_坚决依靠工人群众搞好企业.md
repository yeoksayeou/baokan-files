　　Resolutely Rely on the Working Masses to Run Enterprises Well
    The letter from our newspaper's worker correspondent, Comrade Wang Huihua, criticizing the leadership style of the Party, government, and trade union of the public Shandong Electric Appliance Factory, deserves serious attention from the relevant parties. This letter specifically illustrates how the bureaucratic and commandist ideological style of the factory's leading cadres made work formalistic and ineffective. In April, the Factory Management Committee was established; in May, a call was issued to launch rationalization proposals; in June, the Factory Management Committee decided to establish a "Rationalization Proposal Implementation Committee" and implementation teams; in July, launching rationalization proposals was listed as a central task. However, "until now, this work has still not been launched." What is the reason? This is because "in the past, the factory's leading cadres consistently did not pay enough attention to workers' opinions, and this time there was only a general call, without in-depth mobilization, and without reviewing past undemocratic practices, so the masses still had concerns in their minds." This is because "when the Factory Management Committee was first established, the administrative leaders mistakenly believed that the workers did not have management capabilities..." and even today, "there are still many manifestations of insufficient democratic practices in certain issues." Because the leadership does not have the idea of relying on the workers to run the enterprise well, they do not conduct in-depth mobilization, do not explain the resolutions of the Factory Management Committee in detail to the workers, do not widely solicit the opinions of the working masses, and do not promptly handle the workers' rationalization proposals. Therefore, the strength of the working masses cannot be mobilized, the rationalization proposal movement cannot be launched, and the relevant institutions become formalistic.
    Comrade Wang Huihua's opinion is correct: "It is hoped that the factory's leadership will quickly establish the idea of relying on the working masses to run the enterprise well, carry out democratic movements, promote the enthusiasm of the workers, and run the factory well."

　　坚决依靠工人群众搞好企业
    本报工人通讯员王辉华同志批评公营山东电器厂党、政、工会的领导作风的来信，值得有关方面严重注意。这封来信，具体说明了该厂领导干部的官僚主义和命令主义的思想作风怎样使工作流于形式，没有收到实效。四月份成立了工厂管理委员会，五月份提出开展合理化建议的号召，六月份工厂管理委员会决定建立“合理化建议推行委员会”及推行小组，七月份把开展合理化建议列为中心工作任务，但“直到现在，该项工作依然没有开展”。原因是什么呢？这是因为“过去该厂领导干部对工人意见一贯不够重视，而这一次也只有一般号召，没有深入动员，没有检讨过去的不民主作风，所以群众在思想上仍有顾虑。”这是因为“该厂在工厂管理委员会初建立时，行政领导干部错误地认为工人没有管理能力…………”而直到今天，“在某些问题上还有很多民主作风不够的表现”。领导上因为没有依靠工人搞好企业的思想，所以不深入动员，不向工人详细解释工厂管理委员会的决议，不广泛征求工人群众的意见，不及时处理工人的合理化建议，因而工人群众的力量就发动不起来，合理化建议运动就不能开展，而有关的机构就成形式主义的东西了。
    王辉华同志的意见是对的，就是：“希望该厂领导上迅速树立依靠工人群众搞好企业的思想，开展民主运动，发扬工人的积极性，把工厂搞好。”
