　　Agricultural Models Zhang Shuyi and Gao Guandou Deploy Autumn Harvest and Planting Before Leaving Village for Beijing.
　　Villagers Instruct: Listen to What Instructions Chairman Mao Has, Bring Back More Experiences of Labor Models From Other Places to Learn From.
　　[Reported by This Newspaper] Zhang Shuyi, a production model for disabled veterans from Lingshou County—a hero who sacrificed his legs in the War of Resistance Against Japan—and Gao Guandou, a labor mutual aid and technical improvement model from Shen County, pre-arranged production tasks before leaving their villages to attend the worker, peasant, and soldier labor model representative conference in Beijing. The villagers enthusiastically guaranteed to help with their families' production and work hard to make the village's production even stronger than when they were at home.
　　Zhang Shuyi, in preparation for going to Beijing, helped arrange the village's production at the village work allocation team meeting. He had originally planned to plant eight mu of wheat, but because planting cotton was better than planting other crops, he decided to keep two more mu of cotton fields and plant two mu less of wheat. Now the first plowing of the six mu of wheat land has been completed, with 120 loads of manure applied per mu of irrigated land and 80 loads on dry land. Before he left, he held a family meeting to discuss and make a production plan for the whole family, entrusting the work at home to Wang Yugui, Zhang Fayuan, and Wang Luoxin. At the meeting, his sister-in-law said, "You go ahead, it's an honor for you, it's an honor for our village. You don't have to worry about things at home. After the autumn plowing, we women will engage in sideline occupations." Wang Luoxin, 65 years old, took Zhang Shuyi's hand and said, "You really care about the villagers in our village, working so hard and still planning the production work. We will work hard and do a better job than you in allocating work at home. We will take care of your family, so don't worry; listen carefully to what new methods other labor models have in production, bring them back and we will use them too, to make our lives more prosperous." Zhang Fayuan said, "Go ahead with peace of mind, listen to what instructions Chairman Mao has, and write us a letter!" When Zhang Shuyi set off for Beijing, farmers from villages along the way chased after him to see him off, saying, "We must also learn from him." People from all walks of life in Lingshou County town rushed to see him, and a crowd surrounded him, seeing him off for more than half a kilometer. Zhang Shuyi kept saying, "This is the glory given to me by the Communist Party and the People's Government! This is the glory given to me by everyone."
　　When the peasants of Dahu Jia Village in Shen County heard that Gao Guandou had been selected as a labor model representative, they all felt that it was the greatest honor in the history of the village. Because Gao Guandou was going to Beijing to attend the conference, the villagers automatically helped him harvest rice, gather the autumn crops, and thresh the grain. Now the threshing has been completed and they are preparing to plant wheat, and they have also helped him pick 89 jin of cotton. Before leaving the village, Gao Guandou arranged the crop production at home, and the villagers all made guarantees to Gao Guandou, saying, "After you leave, don't worry about the work at home, we guarantee it will be even better than when you were at home." On September 14th, the village cadres held a farewell meeting, attended by more than 600 people. The applause at the meeting was thunderous. Gao Guandou said at the meeting: "The labor hero title I have received is the result of the leadership of the higher authorities and everyone's efforts. This glory belongs to everyone. Now is the busy season, everyone should work hard on production and make plans, which is better than seeing me off." Old man Gao Laoshuang said, "Since the day Gao Guandou took the lead in advocating the organization of mutual aid in our village, he has done so many good things for us all! It's truly endless to talk about." Sun Laoya, a military dependent in her sixties, asked him, "Please send a message for me, and ask Chairman Mao if he is in good health. Also, don't worry about the lives of us military dependents, because we are producing, and everything is fine. Also, this time you go, bring back more experience from labor models from other places, so we can learn from it!" Many farmers asked Gao Guandou to send their greetings to Chairman Mao, saying, "Thank Chairman Mao for leading our land reform, which has turned our poor peasants over. Now we have plenty of food and clothing, and our lives are better than before." The next day, many farmers saw Gao Guandou off as he left the village.

　　农业模范张树义、高贯斗来京离村前布置秋收秋种
    乡亲们嘱咐说：听听毛主席有什么指示，多带点别地劳模的经验回来，好学习。
    【本报讯】灵寿县荣军生产模范——在抗日战争中牺牲了双腿的英雄张树义及深县劳动互助改进技术模范高贯斗，在来京参加工农兵劳模代表会议离村前，预先布置好了生产。同村乡亲们均热情保证帮助他们家的生产，并努力劳动，要使村中生产，比他们在家时还要强。
    张树义为了准备赴京，在村中的拨工组员会上，帮助布置了村中的生产。他本人原先计划种八亩麦子，因种棉花比种别的庄稼强，就决定多留二亩棉田，少种两亩麦子。现在六亩麦地已耕了头遍，水地每亩上一百二十担粪，旱地上八十担。他动身前开了个家庭会，商量着做好全家的生产计划，把家中的活分别靠给王玉贵、张法元、王洛信。会上，他的嫂子提出说：“你去吧，你光荣，咱家村子里都光荣，家里的事你不用结记，秋耕了地俺娘儿们就搞副业。”六十五岁的王洛信拉着张树义的手说：“你真关心咱庄的乡亲，这么劳累，还把生产工作计划好了，俺们努力干，一定比你在家里拨工做得更好。你家里有俺们照管，不用结记；好好听听别处的劳模在生产上有什么新鲜办法，带回来咱也用用，把光景过得更富裕。”张法元说：“你放心走吧，听听毛主席有什么指示，给我们来信！”张树义动身赴京时，沿路村庄农民都追着送他，并说：“咱也要向他学习。”灵寿县城上各界人民争先恐后地抢着看他，一群人围着他，一直送了他一里多地。张树义不断地说着：“这是共产党、人民政府给我的光荣！这是大家给我的光荣。”
    深县大护驾庄农民听到高贯斗当选为劳模代表，都认为是全村有史以来的最大光荣。因为高贯斗要赴京出席大会，乡亲们纷纷自动地帮他割谷子、收秋、打场，现在场已打完正准备种麦，并且帮他摘了棉花八十九斤。高贯斗在离村前，布置了家中的庄稼生产，乡亲们都向高贯斗提出保证说：“你走后，不用结记家里的活，保证比你在家的时候还强。”九月十四日村干部召开欢送会，群众有六百多人来参加，会中掌声如雷，高贯斗在会中说：我得到这个劳动英雄称号，是上级的领导和大家的努力的结果，这光荣是大家的。现在正是忙时，大家努力生产做好计划比送我还强呢。”老头儿高老双说：“咱村自从高贯斗带头提倡组织互助那天算起，他给咱大伙儿办了多少好事啊！真是说也说不完。”六十多岁的军属孙老雅向他要求：“代我捎个信，见了毛主席问他老人家身体健康，更不用结记俺们军属的生活，因为生产了，俺们一切都好。还有你这次去了，回来多带点别地劳模的经验，好给俺们学习啊！”许多农民都要求高贯斗向毛主席问安，都说：“感谢毛主席领导咱们土地改革，使咱们穷庄稼人翻了身，现在丰衣足食，光景都比以前好了。”第二天许多农民欢送高贯斗走出了村子。
