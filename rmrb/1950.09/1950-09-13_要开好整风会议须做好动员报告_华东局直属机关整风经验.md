According to the preliminary experiences gained by the various organizations directly under the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the rectification, the method of holding rectification meetings for on-the-job cadres is considered better among the various rectification methods currently adopted in the region. The advantage of this type of rectification meeting is that it facilitates linking with work, summarizing experience, and unfolding criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom. However, to hold such a rectification meeting successfully, thorough preparatory work must first be done so that all leading cadres, general cadres, and party members can clearly understand the significance, purpose, principles, and methods of this rectification movement, and can adopt a correct attitude to participate in the rectification movement. Otherwise, the meeting cannot be smoothly unfolded. Secondly, at the beginning of the meeting, the main leading cadres should make a mobilization report on the rectification. The central content of the report should be to summarize the work of the past year, using a combination of theory and practice, and through typical examples, summarize the achievements and shortcomings of the work, and point out the main problems currently existing. At the same time, there should be focused and purposeful examination of policy thinking and work style, and it should be linked to the self-criticism of leading cadres. When leading cadres make self-criticism, they should pay attention to closely linking it with their work, and avoid simply reviewing personal matters. When the report involves criticism of subordinate organs and cadres, it should adhere to the spirit of seeking truth from facts, strive for accuracy, and avoid making conclusions too early, so as not to cause ideological concerns among cadres and make them feel burdened. Under the inspiration of such a mobilization report, lower-level cadres can easily closely integrate reading documents with examining work, so that the rectification movement can embark on the correct path and avoid deviations. Thirdly, this type of rectification meeting should be carried out in a step-by-step and wave-like manner. When mobilizing, the scope can be broader, but when examining the leadership's work style, it should be confined to a certain scope. In this way, opinions are easily concentrated, self-criticism is easily profound, leadership is easy to grasp, and deviations are easy to correct. Finally, adopting this type of rectification method must have good organization and planning, and one must be good at utilizing time and combining it with daily concrete work. Otherwise, it may drag on for a long time or hinder daily work.

　　要开好整风会议须做好动员报告
    华东局直属机关整风经验
    【本报讯】据中共中央华东局各直属机关在整风中所获得的初步经验，证明该区目前所采用的各种整风方式，以召开在职干部的整风会议的方式较好。这种整风会议的好处，在于便于联系工作，总结经验及展开自上而下的批评与自我批评。但要开好这种整风会议，首先要做好充分的准备工作，使所有领导干部、一般干部和党员，都能明确认识此次整风运动的意义、目的、方针和办法，能够采取一种正确的态度来参加整风运动，否则，会议即不可能顺利展开。其次，会议开始时，主要领导干部要做好整风的动员报告。报告的中心内容，应该是总结一年来的工作，用理论与实际相结合的办法，通过典型事例，总结出工作的成绩及缺点，指出目前存在的主要问题。同时应有重点的、有目的的检查政策思想与工作作风，并联系到领导干部的自我检讨。领导干部在作自我检讨时，应注意与工作密切联系，切忌单纯检讨个人；而在报告中涉及到对下级机关及干部的批评时，应本实事求是的精神，力求精确，切忌过早做结论，以免引起干部的思想顾虑而背包袱，在这样的动员报告的启发之下，下面干部容易把阅读文件与检查工作密切结合起来，使整风运动走上正确的轨道而避免发生偏差。第三，此种整风会议，应采取逐级开展与波浪推进的方式进行，在动员时，范围可以广泛些，在检查领导作风时，则应该约束在一定范围之内。这样，意见容易集中，检讨容易深刻，领导容易掌握，出了偏差也容易纠正。最后，采用此种整风方式，必须要有很好的组织性与计划性，要善于利用时间，与日常具体工作结合进行。否则，就可能拖长时间，或妨害日常工作。
