From Zhongnan Worker Daily: Bian Guanghe, Guo Ziyin, and Shi Shanjiao, workers in the Technology Inspection Section of the Sanqiao Railway Factory of the Xi'an Railway Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, created a chain-making tool as a gift to celebrate National Day. In 1950, the majority of vehicles entering the factory for repair were ×1 type freight cars. The hand brakes of these freight cars are tightened using chains. Therefore, the need for chains has increased along with the progress of car repairs; the standard specifications for quality have also been raised. Previously, when the forging workshop forged these chains, they used an iron rod to wind the iron strips that make up the chains into rings. It was difficult to make each ring of the chain the same size and shape, so during tightening, there were bound to be distortions and uneven force. Moreover, it took three people three and a half hours to make one set. The tool created by workers Bian Guanghe and others uses the pressure of four rollers to bend the iron strip 180 degrees into a ring shape. Then, a plier-shaped tool is used to twist open the joint, fit it into another ring, and the chain is made, then the joint is welded. Because the pressure of the four rollers is balanced and has a certain stroke pattern, there are no distortions or inconsistencies. Using this tool, with the same manpower and time, nine sets of chains can be made, increasing work efficiency by nine times. At the same time, it can not only make handbrake chains, but also chains for various cranes, regardless of size, as long as the tool is made according to its proportional dimensions.

    创造制链子工具献给国庆
    生产效率提高九倍及时供应需要
    【本报讯】据中南工人日报消息：郑州铁路局西安铁路分局三桥铁路工厂技检股工友边广和、郭子银、史善交，创制制造链子的工具一部，作为庆祝国庆的献礼。该厂一九五○年入厂修理的车辆，大多数是×１型的货车。这种货车的手闸，都是用链子来紧闸。所以链子的需要，跟着修车的进度也增加了；对于品质的标准规格，也提高了要求。以前锻工场锻制这种链子的时候，是用一根铁棍，将作链子的铁条，缠绕成环。很难使链子每一环的大小形状一致，因此在紧闸的时候，难免不有歪扭和着力不匀的现象。而且三个人需三点半钟才能打成一付。边广和等工友创制的工具，是借着四个滚轮的压力，把铁条弯成一百八十度，成为环形，再用一钳形工具，将接口扭开，套到另一环中，即可作成链子，然后用电焊接口。因为四个滚轮的压力是平衡的，有一定的行程规律，所以没有歪扭不一致的情形。而利用这种工具，同一样的人力和时间，可以作出九付链子，工作效率提高九倍。同时不仅只能作手闸链子，即是各种起重机的链子，不拘大小，只要按照它的比例尺寸，将工具制好，就可制出。
