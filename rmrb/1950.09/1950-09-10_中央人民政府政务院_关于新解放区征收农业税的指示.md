　　Instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the Collection of Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas

　　(1) The autumn harvest is now underway, and the newly liberated areas are about to begin collecting agricultural taxes. This is a major event because it is related to consolidating the balance of national financial revenue and expenditure and the burden on the vast population. The Central People's Government has promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" for this purpose. These regulations are formulated based on the general situation in the newly liberated areas, especially the situation where land reform has not yet been carried out, while also referring to the experience of grain collection last year. According to these regulations, the agricultural tax rate has been reduced (the national public grain accounts for 17% of the total agricultural income, reduced from 17% last year to 13%, plus local grain, it is reduced from about 20% to 15%), the burden on all classes has been reduced, the burden ratio of all classes is more fair and reasonable, and appropriate consideration has been given to landlords. People's governments at all levels in the newly liberated areas, especially the provincial (municipal) people's governments, must carefully study these regulations, truly grasp their principles, and formulate appropriate implementation details with reference to the specific conditions of their respective provinces (municipalities).

　　(2) People's governments at all levels in the newly liberated areas should list this work as one of the current important tasks, implement principal leader responsibility and direct leadership, and concentrate the necessary forces to complete this task. It is absolutely impermissible to simply hand over this arduous task to financial and grain personnel. The people's governments of each province (municipality), special district, and county must be responsible for adopting appropriate methods, such as holding meetings and running short-term training classes, to convene the grain collection personnel dispatched and relevant personnel of the lower-level governments for training, and help them truly understand the provisional regulations on agricultural tax and the implementation details. When time permits, they should also send capable cadres to conduct typical experiments in agricultural tax collection, gain experience, and promote it, in order to minimize deviations in execution. The people's governments of counties, districts, townships (villages) should mobilize activists from people's organizations, and after helping them understand the provisional regulations on agricultural tax, they should conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and explanation to grain-paying households of all classes, so that the provisional regulations on agricultural tax are known to every household and familiar to the masses.

　　(3) Township (village) people's governments must universally and without exception organize agricultural tax investigation and evaluation committees including representatives of all classes. The task of the agricultural tax investigation and evaluation committee is to carefully investigate the acreage, yield, and population of taxpayer households, as well as tenancy relations and other circumstances. At the same time, it should rely on the peasant masses to expose concealment of land, false reporting of yields, and evasion of burdens. Then, according to the provisions of the provisional regulations on agricultural tax, it should calculate and evaluate the tax amount payable by each household, and appropriately mediate and handle disputes between taxpayer households, so that agricultural tax collection is truly fair and reasonable, and avoids excessively light or heavy phenomena.

　　(4) People's governments at all levels and grain collection personnel must strictly abide by policies and act in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas." They must not arbitrarily increase or decrease land yields, must not change the tax rate without authorization, must not freely increase the burden, add extra levies at each level, and must not exaggerate difficulties and reduce the amount to be collected. In short, they must oppose the tendency to disregard policies and simply complete tasks, and at the same time, they must prevent the tendency to emphasize difficulties and let things take their own course. In order to strengthen the leadership of grain collection work, people's governments at all levels, in addition to dispatching a large number of capable cadres to go deep into the countryside to assist local grain collection work, and to inspect, summarize experience, and correct deviations at any time, should also use telephones and various communication methods to closely connect with upper and lower levels.

　　(5) When people's representative conferences at all levels are convened, the people's governments at the same level must report to them on the agricultural tax collection situation. At the end of the winter collection task, the people's governments at all levels should summarize the collection work and report it level by level. The people's governments of each province (municipality) and the greater administrative regions should submit summary reports to the central government.

### 中央人民政府政务院  关于新解放区征收农业税的指示

　　中央人民政府政务院
    关于新解放区征收农业税的指示
    （一）目前秋收业已登场，新解放区即将开始征收农业税的工作。这是一件大事，因为它关联到巩固国家财政收支平衡和广大人口的负担问题，中央人民政府为此已颁布“新解放区农业税暂行条例”。这个条例是根据新解放区一般情况，特别是还没有经过土地改革的情况，同时又参考去年征粮经验，加以制定的。根据这个条例，农业税的税率降低了（国家公粮占农业总收入由去年的百分之十七降低至百分之十三，加上地方粮约为由百分之二十降低至百分之十五），各阶层的负担都减轻了，各阶层的负担比例更趋于公平合理，对地主也有了适当的照顾。新解放区各级人民政府，尤其省（市）人民政府，必须认真研究这个条例，确实掌握它的原则，并参照各该省（市）具体情况，制定适当的施行细则。
    （二）新解放区各级人民政府应将这一工作列为当前重要任务之一，实行首长负责、直接领导，并集中必要力量，完成这一任务，决不可将这一繁巨的工作简单地交给财粮工作人员去办。各省（市）、专、县人民政府必须负责采取适当方式，如开会、办短期训练班等，召集所派出的征粮人员及下级政府有关人员加以训练，帮助他们确实了解农业税暂行条例和施行细则。时间允许时，并应尽可能派出得力干部进行征收农业税的典型试验，取得经验，加以推广，以期在执行中尽量减少偏差。县、区、乡（村）人民政府则应动员人民团体的积极分子，在帮助他们了解农业税暂行条例之后，经过他们向各阶层纳粮户进行广泛深入的宣传解释，使农业税暂行条例，家喻户晓，为大众所熟知。
    （三）乡（村）人民政府必须普遍无例外地组织包括各阶层代表在内的农业税调查评议委员会。农业税调查评议委员会的任务，在于认真调查纳税户的土地亩数、产量和人口，以及租佃关系等情况，同时依靠农民群众揭发隐瞒土地、虚报产量和逃避负担等情形，然后根据农业税暂行条例的规定，计算和评议各户应交税额，并适当地调解和处理纳税户间的纠纷，使农业税征收确实做到公平合理，避免畸轻畸重现象。
    （四）各级人民政府和征粮工作人员，必须严格遵守政策，依照“新解放区农业税暂行条例”办事，不得随意提高或降低土地产量，不得擅自改变征收税率，不得自由加重负担，层层加派，亦不得夸大困难，借故减少应征数字。总之，必须反对不顾政策，单纯完成任务的偏向，同时也要防止强调困难，放任自流的偏向。为要加强征粮工作的领导，各级人民政府除派遣大批得力干部深入农村协助当地征粮工作，及随时检查，总结经验，纠正偏向外，并应利用电话和各种通讯方法，密切上下级联系。
    （五）各级人民代表会议召开时，同级人民政府必须向其报告农业税征收情况。在冬季征收任务结束时，各级人民政府应对征收工作加以总结，按级上报。各省（市）人民政府和大行政区人民政府应向中央提出总结报告。
