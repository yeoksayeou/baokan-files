Xinhua News Agency, Andong, September 2nd. Our reporter reports details of the incident of American planes strafing civilian ships on the Yalu River: At 5:45 PM on August 29th, four American P-51 fighter planes intruded approximately three kilometers into our national territory from the direction of Korea, conducting reconnaissance over the area of Lagu Post in Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, at an altitude of only 500 to 800 meters. The four American planes continued flying along the Yalu River, reaching the air above Changdian River Mouth Village, about one kilometer from Lagu Post. At that time, there were seven of our civilian ships navigating in that area. These civilian ships all flew our national flag and were pulling their way upstream one by one. More than ten boatmen were in the water pulling ropes for the boat of fisherman Chen Yufa. The boat was only two meters away from the riverbank (the right bank of the Yalu River). At this moment, the American planes suddenly descended to a low altitude of just over ten meters above the river surface, and one of them, from south to north, strafed the boat, killing fisherman Yin Xiaolin and wounding fishermen Liang Zhongde and Li Dianchen, who were helping to pull the boat. The boat's hull was riddled with nine holes of various sizes, and many of the pots, bowls, and other utensils in the rear cabin were smashed.

At 17:50, the four American planes flew down the river again, reaching the air above the Jiangmian River in Gulouzi Village, Kuandian County. At this time, there were four civilian ships flying our national flag navigating in that area, one of which was stranded on the riverbed, and ten fishermen were pushing the boat. After circling once over Gulouzi Village, the four American planes flew low to the river surface. The first three planes quickly swept over the boat; the last plane circled over the boat once before diving to an altitude of about twenty meters above the water and strafing the boat, instantly killing fishermen Wu Xichun, Dong Jingui, and Liu Fuzhou. Liu Fuzhou immediately fell into the river. The American planes also wounded Zhang Yunfu and Zhang Yunzhi (both seriously injured), Chen Shengkui, Yang Decheng, and Jia Yufa (all slightly injured). The boat's hull was riddled with seventeen holes of various sizes, and the rear rudder handle was broken in three places, the largest crack being more than six inches long. Three straw bags containing grain on the boat were broken, and two bullets fired by the American planes have already been removed from the grain.

The four aircraft that strafed the above two locations of our civilian ships were all painted with a circular blue background with a white five-pointed star in the center, and long rectangular blue lines on both sides, the markings of the American Air Force.

　　美机扫射我鸭绿江
    民船多只被击详情
    【新华社安东二日电】本社记者报道美机扫射我鸭绿江上民船事件详情称：八月二十九日下午五时四十五分，美国Ｐ五十一战斗机四架，自朝鲜方向侵入我国国境三公里左右，在辽东省宽甸县属之拉古哨地方上空进行侦察，高度仅五百公尺至八百公尺。该四架美机续沿鸭绿江上飞，到达距拉古哨约一公里长甸河口村以东上空。是时，有我国民船七只，在该处航行。这些民船均悬有我国国旗，正逐一拉纤逆流而上。船夫十余人在水中为渔夫陈玉发之船拉纤。该船离江岸（鸭绿江右岸）仅两公尺。这时，美机突降至距江面十余公尺之低空，其中一架由南向北，对该船扫射，将该船渔夫尹效林击毙，并将帮助该船拉纤之渔夫梁忠德、李殿臣二人击伤。船身被击破大小洞口九个，后仓内之锅碗等用具被击碎者很多。
    至十七时五十分，该四架美机又顺江而下，飞至宽甸县属古楼子村江面上空。此时有悬挂我国国旗的民船四只，在该处航行，其中一只在江面搁浅，十名渔夫正在推动船身。四架美机在古楼子村上空盘旋一周后，即低飞至江面。前三架至该船上空迅速掠过；最后一架绕船上空盘旋一周后，即俯冲至距水面约二十公尺之低空向该船扫射，当将渔夫吴锡纯、董金贵、刘福洲等三人击毙。刘福洲当即倒入江中。美机并击伤张云福、张云芝（均重伤）、陈盛奎、杨德诚、贾玉发（均轻伤）等五人。船身被击破大小洞口十七处，船后舵柄被击破三处，其中最大之裂口长达六英寸多。船上包装着粮食的草袋被击破三个，美机发射的子弹已有两枚自粮食中取出。
    扫射上述两处我国民船之四架飞机，均涂有圆形蓝底，中有白色五星，两旁并有长方形蓝线之美国空军标志。
