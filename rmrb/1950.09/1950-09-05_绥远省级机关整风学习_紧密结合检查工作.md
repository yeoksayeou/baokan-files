　　Suiyuan Provincial Organs' Rectification Study
    Closely Integrated with Inspection Work
    [Our Newspaper] In the rectification study of Suiyuan provincial organs, the attitude towards learning has been corrected, and the study of documents has been closely integrated with inspection work. All units of the provincial government have also formulated plans for combining inspection work. In order to prepare for this year's autumn grain collection, the Finance Department will focus on inspecting and summarizing last year's autumn grain collection work. The Provincial Taxation Bureau will combine the ongoing second-quarter tax collection to inspect and summarize this year's tax collection work. The Public Security Bureau will summarize the work of suppressing bandits and eliminating special agents over the past year in order to promote the current central task. The Industry and Commerce Department and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative will combine the current joint meetings of public factory directors and the joint meetings of supply and marketing cooperative managers from various regions to use the spirit of rectification to inspect and summarize the recovery and development of industrial production and the development of urban and rural material exchanges since the liberation of Suiyuan, and thereby determine the tasks and guidelines for the second half of the year. At the same time, methods of improving work at any time were adopted. The Provincial Grain Bureau discovered during inspection that in the Sui West and Sui Central areas, due to the lack of warehouse facilities in the past, public grain was entrusted to private individuals for safekeeping, resulting in large quantities of grain being moldy and destroyed. In 1948 and 1949 alone, more than 13 million catties of grain were lost. In order to prevent such serious waste from happening again in the future, the Provincial Grain Bureau immediately drafted a warehouse construction plan and submitted it to the higher authorities for approval and implementation.
    When the rectification study of Suiyuan provincial organs began, some deviations occurred: some organs had a very serious phenomenon of studying documents for the sake of studying documents, such as copying documents and reading notes at discussion meetings. Some leading cadres of organs advocated rectifying cadres' liberalism, while cadres demanded rectifying leading cadres' bureaucracy. Some organs also vaguely put forward several articles for inspecting work. The Rectification Study Committee made a special report on this, explaining how to study documents and combine them with inspection work, and paying attention to exchanging the learning experiences of various units at any time, so as to correct the attitude towards learning.

　　绥远省级机关整风学习
    紧密结合检查工作
    【本报讯】绥远省级机关整风学习中，端正了学习态度，使学习文件与检查工作密切结合。省府各单位并订出了结合检查工作的计划。财政厅为给今年秋征工作做好准备，要着重检查、总结去年秋征工作。省税务局结合正在进行的二季税收，检查、总结本年度税收工作。公安厅为推动当前中心工作，总结一年来的剿匪肃特工作。工商厅、省供销总社，结合目前正在召开的各公营厂长联席会，各地供销社经理联席会，以整风精神来检查总结绥远全境解放以来，恢复与发展工业生产与开展城乡物资交流等工作，并由此确定下半年方针、任务。同时采取了随时改进工作的方法。省粮食局在检查中发现绥西绥中地区，过去因无仓库设备，把公粮托给私人保管，致使大批粮食霉烂毁坏，仅一九四八、四九两年即损失粮食一千三百多万斤。为使今后不再发生此种严重的浪费现象，省粮食局即拟出建库计划，呈交上级批准执行。
    绥远省级机关整风学习开始时，曾发生过这样一些偏向：有些机关就文件学文件的现象很严重，如抄文件，在讨论会上念笔记等等。有些机关领导干部主张整干部的自由主义，干部则要求整领导干部的官僚主义。也有些机关空洞的提出了检查工作的几项条文。整风学委会为此作了专题报告，讲解怎么学习文件与结合检查工作的方法，并注意随时交流各单位的学习经验，才端正了学习态度。
