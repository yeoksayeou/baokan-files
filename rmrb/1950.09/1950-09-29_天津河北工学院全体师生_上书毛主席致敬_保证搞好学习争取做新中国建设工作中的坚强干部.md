Tianjin Hebei Institute of Technology All Teachers and Students
Write to Chairman Mao to Pay Tribute
Guarantee to Study Hard and Strive to Be Strong Cadres in the Construction of New China

[This newspaper's dispatch] Correspondent Li Shumin reports: All teachers and students of Hebei Institute of Technology in Tianjin wrote to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to study hard, improve their health, and strive to be strong cadres in the construction of New China. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

	As the people of the whole country joyfully welcome the first National Day, we, all the faculty, staff, and students of Hebei Institute of Technology, extend to you our most sincere respect and guarantee to do a good job in teaching and learning and all the work that should be done.

	On October 1, 1949, you solemnly declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China with a voice that shook the world. Since then, the Chinese people have stood up and truly become masters of their own house. In the past year, the mainland has been basically liberated, the economy has gradually improved, and a nationwide land reform movement has begun. These glorious achievements are the fruits of victory won under your wise leadership. Here, we once again firmly guarantee that we will strengthen our technical and political studies and improve our health, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

	At present, all the faculty, staff, and students of our school are engaged in a heatwave of intense study and work, applying the theory they have learned to practice. During the summer vacation, more than 40 workers from the school voluntarily repaired the student dormitories and the dyeing laboratory for the school, saving the country more than 7,000 kilograms of rice. Professors have also completed the teaching plans for this semester before the start of school according to the resolutions of the Higher Education Conference, and have begun to form teaching research and guidance groups. The average score of all students last semester increased by 1.75 points. In the future, we will work harder and with greater determination to study hard, improve our health, and strive to be strong cadres in the construction of New China, and use these practical actions to thank you for your care for us.

	In the past year, under the leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, all aspects of our school have been greatly improved. Starting from this semester, the school name has been officially changed to "Hebei Institute of Technology". After the announcement of the new school name, all teachers and students enthusiastically wished to respectfully request Chairman Mao to inscribe the new school badge and school plaque, and regard it as an honor. Therefore, we kindly request Chairman Mao to take the time out of his busy work to inscribe "Hebei Institute of Technology" and "Hebei Industrial School Affiliated to Hebei Institute of Technology" on a strip of paper each. This will be a more powerful and great encouragement for us. With sincere respect and wishes for good health!
		
		All faculty, staff, and students of Hebei Institute of Technology together

　　天津河北工学院全体师生
    上书毛主席致敬
    保证搞好学习争取做新中国建设工作中的坚强干部
    【本报讯】通讯员李树民报道：天津市河北工学院全体师生上书毛主席，保证搞好学习练好身体，争取在新中国建设工作中作一个坚强的干部。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们河北工学院全体师生员工在全国人民欢欣迎接第一个国庆日的时候，谨向你致以最崇高的敬礼，并保证搞好教和学及一切应该做的工作。
    一九四九年十月一日，你用震撼世界的声音，庄严地宣告中华人民共和国的成立。从此，中国人民站立起来，真正作了主人。一年来，全国大陆已基本解放，经济逐渐走向好转，并开始进行了全国范围的土地改革运动，这些光辉成就，都是由于你的英明领导所换得的胜利果实。在这里，我们再一次的坚决保证：一定加强技术和政治的学习并搞好身体，全心全意为人民服务。
    现在我校全体师生员工都投入紧张学习工作的热潮中，把学得的理论用之于实践。在暑假期间，全校四十余位工友，自动为学校修缮了学生宿舍和漂染实验室，给国家节省了七千多斤米。教授们也根据高等教育会议的决议，在开学以前，作完了本学期的教学计划，并分别开始组成教学研究指导小组。全校同学上学期的成绩平均增加了一·七五分，以后将以更高的努力和决心，搞好学习，练好身体，争取在新中国建设工作中作一个坚强干部，用这些实际行动来答谢你对我们的关怀。
    一年来，我校在中央人民政府教育部的领导下，各方面都有了很大改进，从本学期起，校名正式改为“河北工学院”，当此新校名发表以后，全校师生都以热烈的心情愿把这新的校徽及校匾恭请毛主席题字，并以此引为光荣，因此我们谨请毛主席在工作百忙中，抽暇题写“河北工学院”及“河北工学院附设工业学校”字条各一份。这对于我们将是更有力的伟大鼓励。谨致崇高敬礼并祝健康！
          河北工学院全体师生员工同启
