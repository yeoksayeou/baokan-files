　　Hebei's New Cotton Procurement Has Shortcomings
　　Linqing Experiences Market Chaos, Proving Unified Procurement is Necessary.
　　[This Newspaper's Report] After new cotton entered the market, state-owned trading companies in various regions began procurement work. Generally, they were able to be prepared, planned, and appropriately grasp price policies to ensure the interests of cotton farmers, with farmers generally giving positive feedback. However, many shortcomings occurred in Hebei Province's procurement, which deserve attention from other regions. For example, in late August, new cotton in Linqing, Hebei, was successively put on the market. Various public and private firms went to the area to procure cotton. Due to a lack of unified organization and planning, there was no unified control over prices or quality. Some procurement prices were too high (new cotton was purchased at the price of old cotton), creating a competitive purchasing phenomenon. As a result, the Linqing market experienced chaos, causing grain and cloth prices to rise. From August 22nd to 28th, in just seven days, the price of wheat rose by 26.6%, millet rose by 12.3%, and Wufu cloth rose by 8.8%, which was extremely unfavorable to the local people. This gave us a serious lesson, demonstrating that in order to avoid market chaos, especially in cotton-producing areas, it is absolutely necessary for both public and private firms to conduct procurement with unified organization and unified steps.
　　Most regions did a good job of fully preparing supplies before procurement to meet the needs of farmers after selling new cotton. However, in some places, the prepared supplies could not meet the demands of the farmers, affecting the progress of procurement work. For example, in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, state-owned cotton yarn cloth, general merchandise, and grain companies all made preparations before procurement. However, they prepared old millet, general merchandise, etc., while cotton farmers needed wheat and Renminbi more. The companies were at a loss at the time. Therefore, when a large amount of cotton entered the market in late August, a serious situation arose where no one was buying, causing farmers to complain bitterly. This illustrates the importance of conducting thorough and detailed investigations and research beforehand to understand the specific requirements of local farmers. Otherwise, one will commit the mistake of empiricism.
　　In some areas, due to the low skill level of cotton inspectors in state-owned trading companies during procurement, farmers' "Si Zi" cotton (four-petal cotton) was mistakenly identified as "Wu Da Ban" (five-lobe) cotton (Si Zi cotton has longer fibers and a higher price). This also caused dissatisfaction and criticism from farmers, who believed that the state-owned trading companies were not knowledgeable about the goods. Such a thing happened in Nangong, Hebei Province. If the cotton inspection work is not done well, not only will it be impossible to accurately control prices, but it may also cause difficulties in storage and significant losses to the state. Currently, some regions have paid attention to cultivating and improving the business level of cotton inspection personnel, which is very necessary. (Deng Shiying)

### 河北收购新棉有缺点  临清一度发生市场混乱，证明统一采购是必要的。

　　河北收购新棉有缺点
    临清一度发生市场混乱，证明统一采购是必要的。
    【本报讯】新棉上市后，各地国营贸易公司都已展开收购工作，一般能作到有准备、有计划，并能适当掌握价格政策，保证棉农利益，农民大都反映良好。但河北省各地在收购中，也发生了不少缺点，值得引起各地注意。如八月下旬河北临清新棉陆续登场，各地公私营厂商都到该地采购，由于缺乏统一组织与计划，无论在价格上、质量上都无统一掌握，有的收购价格过高（新花当陈花一样收购），形成竞购现象，结果造成临清市场一度混乱，引起粮布价格上涨，自八月二十二日到二十八日七天之间麦价上涨百分之二十六点六，小米上涨百分之十二点三，五福布上升百分之八点八，对当地人民极为不利。这给了我们一个严重的教训，说明为了避免引起市场的混乱，特别在棉产地采购，无论公营、私营厂商统一组织统一步调进行采购是完全必要的。
    各地在收购前充分准备实物以应出卖新棉后农民的需要，大体上作得不错，但也有的地方因准备的实物，不能满足农民的要求，而影响收购工作的进行。如河北武安县，国营花纱布、百货、粮食等公司在收购前也都有准备，但准备的是陈小米、百货等，而棉农却更需要小麦和人民币，公司当时却束手无策，因此八月下旬棉花大量上市时，造成无人收购引起农民叫苦的严重现象。这说明事前结合当地农民具体要求深入细致的调查研究的重要，否则，就要犯经验主义的毛病。
    有的地区，因国营贸易公司在收购中，检验棉花的人员水平低，把农民的斯字棉误认为五大瓣（斯字棉较五大瓣纤维长，价格高），也引起农民的不满与批评，认为国营贸易公司不识货。河北省南宫就发生过这样的事。检验棉花工作做不好，不仅不能正确的掌握价格，更可能造成保管上的困难与国家的重大损失。目前有些地区，已注意培养、提高检验棉花人员的业务水平，这是非常必要的。（邓世英）
