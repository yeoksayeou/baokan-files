Do not Abuse the Issuance of Investigation and Statistical Forms
    The Counselor's Office of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Government Administration Council
    (I)
    According to an investigation in June of this year, the number of investigation and statistical forms that eight departments of the Yanggao County Government in the Yanbei Special District of Chahar Province, including civil affairs, finance, education, industry, commerce, taxation, water conservancy, and the court, had to fill out and report to higher authorities in April and May amounted to as many as 106 kinds, according to incomplete statistics (not including 32 kinds of financial, grain, and tax system forms). There were 38 kinds of quarterly reports, 31 kinds of monthly reports, 5 kinds of ten-day reports, and 32 kinds of temporary forms. The commerce departments had the most, with 24 kinds of forms; industry was second, with 22 kinds; followed by taxation, with 15 kinds; finance, with 11 kinds; and other departments were all below 10 kinds. Issuing organs: the central government issued 11 kinds, the provincial government issued 31 kinds, the special commissioner's office issued 50 kinds, and the county issued 14 kinds. Of the 106 kinds of forms, 85 kinds were to be filled out by county-level organs, and 21 kinds were issued to district-level organs.
    The Chahar South Special District also had a similar situation. In addition to the 32 kinds of forms issued by the prefectural committee organs and the Women's Federation, the Chahar South Special Commissioner's Office also issued 106 kinds of various investigation forms (not including judicial, public security, armed forces, banks, and cooperatives). Among them, taxation accounted for 26 kinds, civil affairs 19 kinds, culture and education 16 kinds (including 10 kinds of hygiene), finance 15 kinds, industry 14 kinds, water conservancy 9 kinds, commerce 3 kinds, and secretarial 4 kinds. Most of these were forms forwarded by the provincial government, and most had to be forwarded by the county to the district level for completion.
    In general, the content of all the above-mentioned investigation forms is quite complex. For example, the marriage investigation form in Huailai County included the following figures: number of marriages, bought marriages, arranged marriages, parents finding partners with the individual's consent, completely free love, child brides, and early marriages. Agricultural and sideline industry investigation forms were even more complicated. Some had to count how many chickens there were, how many males and females, how many hard-shelled eggs were laid, and how many soft-shelled eggs? There were investigations on livestock breeding, investigations on the number of agricultural tools (including large carts, handcarts, plows, harrows, plowshares, plow ears, hoes, and shovels, and how many were repaired or added, as well as the number of male and female full laborers, half laborers, and oxen co-ops), investigations on the amount of fertilizer applied, and investigations on the sown area of various crops, and all were compared with the increases and decreases before the war (1937) and in 1949 and 1950, and percentages had to be calculated. The investigation content of intensive cultivation was: the number of reclaimed and unreclaimed wasteland, the number of terraced fields, paddy fields, dry land, and wet land, the number of cultivated and uncultivated land, the percentage of land cultivated once and twice, the number of beach land reclaimed and the number that could and could not be sown that year, the number of sandy land started, the number of padded land, the amount of accumulated fertilizer and applied fertilizer, and the average number of loads per mu. There was also an investigation into the timber needed by organs, troops, and state-owned mines in 1950. The farmland water conservancy plan report form included the nature of the water conservancy, the types and conditions of the projects, and the strength of the masses. In terms of industry and commerce, there were market price fixed-base chain index tables, regional difference profit calculation tables for major materials (commodities), and sales volume statistics code reporting tables. Other investigations, such as measles epidemic investigations, had to be statistically analyzed year by year; in the illiteracy investigation, the age of children (seven to sixteen years old) also had to be statistically analyzed year by year. In these forms, there were many that not only district and village cadres did not know how to fill out, but even county cadres did not understand. For example, timber was measured in cubic meters, and price fixed-base chain indexes were beyond the cultural level of general county and district cadres. Therefore, of the 106 kinds of investigation forms of the above-mentioned Yanggao County Government, 37 kinds (accounting for 35 percent) were not filled out.
    (II)
    Due to the above situation, county and district cadres felt that there were too many forms and the content was too complex. It was very difficult to fill out the forms: reporting them was embarrassing because they had to cope, and some had to estimate or fabricate; not reporting them was feared to be a violation of organizational discipline. Therefore, the problems that arose were:
    (1) It seriously affected the work and at the same time fostered commandism in the implementation of work below. For example, the county-level organs were not large, but a considerable number of cadres had to spend a lot of effort on statistical figures. When the forms were issued to the district level, it took up most of the strength and time of the district cadres, and the district secretary was almost completely used for statistical filling, unable to handle other work. Some district cadres (such as Yanggao Ten District) formed a work purely for the sake of numbers. After arriving at the village, they only registered some numbers and left. When reporting on their work, they reported a lot of numbers, but they did not understand what problems these numbers could explain and solve in the work. Even some district cadres, in order to urge the reporting of militia registers, which was not an urgent matter, sent two militiamen at night to deliver urging slips along the villages, wanting to wait and bring them back. The slip was also written in large letters: "Those who violate will be severely punished." A total of five villages were notified along the way, so ten militiamen spent half a night on this militia register. Such examples are not too isolated in rural areas, and it is even more conceivable how much effort village-level cadres spent on statistical figures.
    (2) Not getting the real ones, so they reported fake ones, which also fostered bureaucracy in the work. There is a relatively common situation now. For example, the village party secretary or village head often carries a ready-made general agricultural tax investigation form. As soon as you ask for the basic figures, they will take it out and ask you to extract them yourself; or when the district cadres arrive, they will gather the relevant village cadres together and estimate various figures by piece to complete the task. This is still considered better. There are also many village cadres who even fabricate false figures and falsely report achievements, while the district leaders, due to their lack of in-depth leadership, are deceived for a long time, and instead think that these villages can complete the tasks. At the representative meeting held in Yanggao Ten District, the representative of Zhao Jiazhai Village criticized the above for engaging in numbers all day long, but they were not accurate. He pointed out that the production figures of the village were fabricated by the village clerk.
    (III)
    The leadership at all levels attaches great importance to investigation and research, which is of course a good phenomenon, but why are investigation and statistical forms issued so indiscriminately? What should be done in the future? Our observations are:
    (1) Many leading organs only pay attention to the sentence "The only way to understand the situation is to conduct investigations in society..." (Preface to Mao Zedong's Rural Investigation), but forget another sentence that Chairman Mao also said: "Universal investigation is impossible and unnecessary" (ibid.). Therefore, whenever a task is to be carried out, many investigation forms are issued indiscriminately (for example, Huailai County issued ten kinds of investigation forms before and after carrying out democratic political construction, and issued twelve kinds of forms for investigating production materials alone). Many are investigations for the sake of investigation, or simply rely on forms to understand the situation, treating investigation and research work vulgarly, not using their brains, not looking at dynamics, and not learning to analyze. This style greatly affects the improvement of our work quality. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect and improve the investigation and research work of various organs. We should not regard simply issuing some investigation forms as the only method of investigation and research. We should use various necessary and possible methods, such as holding investigation meetings, engaging in typical examples, and using various cadre meetings, representative meetings, and individual conversations to collect materials. Experience has proven that only by adopting these methods more can we understand the basic situation that must be understood.
    (2) The leading organs lack planning and organization in the formulation and issuance of investigation forms. What needs to be universally investigated, what is enough to only conduct typical investigations, what needs to be investigated and filled out by cadres below, what needs to be personally investigated and researched by the leading organs..., all were not planned in detail in advance, forming a blind formulation. Secondly, some forms have overlapping investigation content (such as the basic number investigation of the civil affairs department, the production situation investigation of the industrial department, and the agricultural tax investigation of the finance department), and they have not been well organized, but rather each manages its own affairs, causing waste. Therefore, in the future, the formulation and issuance of investigation forms should be centrally reviewed by the leadership to prevent indiscriminate printing and issuance. A statistical archive and data management work should also be established. Departments should be closely linked, and investigation data can be organized and exchanged, mutually extracted and used, avoiding repeated investigations and wasting manpower and material resources.
    (3) After the establishment of the Central People's Government, the obvious phenomenon is that the higher up the division of labor is more detailed, and the lower down it is, the more comprehensive it is. Some leading organs often proceed from subjective wishes and demand too much of rural cadres. In the future, when issuing investigation forms, we must pay attention to the principle of need and possibility, and strive to be concise in both quantity and content. Anything that is not necessary or difficult for lower levels to fill out should not be issued. For specialized or historical investigations and statistics, the leading organs should send special personnel to conduct typical investigations, and should never easily conduct universal investigations and statistics.
    All localities are streamlining and reorganizing, and they are all faced with the situation of having fewer people and more affairs. It is necessary to require the above to simplify administration so that the below can concentrate their efforts on doing a few major tasks well. For this reason, it is recommended that leading organs at all levels not indiscriminately issue investigation and statistical forms. We believe that this is an important issue in the current government work.

　　不要滥发调查统计表格
    政务院政法委员会参事室
    （一）
    据本年六月份调查，察哈尔省雁北专区阳高县政府民政、财政、教育、实业、工商、税务、水利、法院等八个部门四、五月份要向上级填报的调查统计表格，据不完全统计，共达一百零六种之多（财粮及税收制度表格三十二种尚不在内）。计季报表三十八种，月报表三十一种，旬报表五种，临时性的三十二种。工商部门最多，有二十四种表；实业次之，二十二种；再次为税务，十五种，财政十一种；其他部门均在十种以下。颁发表格机关：中央发十一种，省府发三十一种，专署发五十种，县发十四种。一百零六种表格由县级机关填报的共八十五种，发至区级的二十一种。
    察南专区亦有同样的情形，除地委机关及妇联所发表格三十二种外，察南专署所发各种调查表格亦有一百零六种之多（尚不包括司法、公安、武装、银行、合作社）。其中税务占二十六种，民政十九种，文教十六种（内卫生十种），财政十五种，实业十四种，水利九种，工商三种，秘书四种。其中大部分为转发省府的表格，且大部须由县转发到区级填造。
    所有以上各种调查表格，内容一般是相当复杂的。如怀来县的婚姻调查表内，包括：婚姻对数、买卖婚、包办婚、父母找的本人自愿、完全自由恋爱、童养婚、早婚等项数字。农副业调查表格更复杂些，有的要统计有多少只鸡，公、母各多少，下了多少硬皮蛋，软皮蛋？有牲畜繁殖情况的调查，有农具数量（包括大车、手推车、耧、耙、犁杖、犁耳、铧、镢、铁锹等各修补、增添多少及男女整劳力、半劳力、牛犋拨工数目等），施肥数量的调查，有各种作物播种面积的调查，而且都分战前（一九三七年）与一九四九年、一九五○年的增减比较，还要计算百分比。精耕细作的调查内容为：荒地已开、未开数，梯田、水田、旱田、下湿地数，已耕未耕数，一次、二次耕地百分比，修滩地数与当年能播种和不能播种数，起沙地数，垫地数，积肥、施肥、每亩平均担数等。还有机关部队公营矿场一九五○年所需木材调查。农田水利计划报告表有水利性质、工程种类及状况，群众力量等项。工商业方面则有市场价格定基环比指数表，主要物资（商品）地区差额利润计算表，上销量统计代号报告表等。其他如麻疹病疫调查，要逐岁统计；文盲调查中的儿童年龄（七至十六岁）也要逐岁统计。这些表格中，有许多不独区村干部不知道如何填造，有的连县干部都不懂。如木材以立方公尺计，物价定基环比指数等，都是现在一般县区干部的文化水平所无法填报的。所以上述阳高县府的一百零六种调查表格，就有三十七种（占百分之三十五）未有填报。
    （二）
    由于上述情况，使县区干部感觉到：表格太多了，内容太复杂了。对填表很为难：报则窘于应付，有些不得不估计或假造；不报又怕犯无组织无纪律的错误。因此发生的问题是：
    （一）严重地影响工作，同时助长下面执行工作中的命令主义。如县级机关编制不大，但须有相当的一部分干部经常费力在搞统计数字上。而表格发到区级，更占去区干部的大部分力量和时间，区秘书几乎完全用作统计填表，无法办理其他工作。有些区干部（如阳高十区）形成单纯地为搞数目字而工作，到村之后，只登记一下某些数字就走，在汇报工作时，报告了一大堆数目字，但不了解究竟这些数字能说明和解决工作中的什么问题。甚至有的区干部为催报民兵册子，并非急事，也在夜里派两个民兵，沿村传送催报条子，要坐等带回，条子上并大书：“违者重治”，一路共传五村，于是十个民兵，就为这一民兵册子而费去半夜时间。这类例子，在农村中并不是太个别的，至于村级干部为搞统计数字所花去的力量之多，更可想而知。
    （二）搞不来真的，于是就报假的，也助长了工作上的官僚主义。现在有一种较普遍的情形，例如村支书或村长身上多带有现成的农业税调查总表，你一问基本数字，他即拿出叫你自摘；或者是区干部一到，他们即把有关的村干部找在一起，分片把各种数字估计一番即算交卷。这还是较好的。还有不少村干部甚至捏造假数字，虚报成绩，而区里由于领导不深入，亦竟长期被蒙蔽，反认为这些村能完成任务。在阳高十区召开代表会时，赵家寨村的代表就曾批评上面整天搞数目字，但都不确实。他指出该村的生产数目字就是村文书假造的。
    （三）
    各级领导机关对调查研究工作很重视，这固然是好现象，但为何如此滥发调查统计表格？今后应该怎样？我们的观察是：
    （一）许多领导机关，仅注意“要了解情况，唯一的方法是向社会作调查……”这一句话，（毛主席农村调查序言）但忘记了毛主席同时讲的另一句话：“普遍调查是不可能也不需要的”（同上）。所以每要做一项工作，就有很多调查表格滥发下去（如怀来县进行民主建政工作，就前后印发了十种调查表，为调查生产材料一次就发了十二种表格），不少是为调查而调查，或者是单纯依靠表格来了解情况，庸俗地对待调查研究工作，不用脑筋，不看动态，不学习分析，这种作风很影响我们工作质量的提高。因此必须检查改进各机关的调查研究工作，不应把简单地发些调查表格当作唯一的调查研究方法，应该运用各种必要与可能的方法，如开调查会，搞典型，利用各种干部会、代表会、个别谈话等搜集材料，经验证明也只有更多采用这些方法，才能了解到必须了解的基本情况。
    （二）领导机关制发调查表格缺乏计划性组织性。那些是需要普遍调查的，那些是只作典型调查就够了，那些是需要下面干部调查填报的，那些是需要领导机关亲自去人调查研究的……，事先都未详加计划，形成盲目制发。其次有些表格调查内容重复（如民政部门的基础数字调查与实业部门的生产情况调查及财政部门的农业税调查），也未能很好地加以组织，而是各管各的，造成浪费。所以今后制发调查表格，最好由领导上集中统一审查，防止滥印滥发。并应建立统计档案与资料管理工作，各部门之间应密切联系，可将调查资料组织交流，互相摘用，避免重复调查，浪费人力物力。
    （三）中央人民政府成立后，明显的现象是越到上面分工越细，越到下面越是一揽子。有些领导机关办事常从主观愿望出发，对农村干部要求过高。今后在发调查表格时，必须注意需要与可能的原则，数量和内容，均应力求精简，凡不必需或为下级难于填报者，就不应发出。凡带有专门性或历史性的调查统计，最好由领导机关派专人进行典型调查，决不能轻易作普遍性的调查统计。
    各地正在精简整编，都是人少事繁，必须要求上面简政，使下面能集中力量做好几件主要的工作，为此建议各级领导机关，不要滥发调查统计表格，我们认为这是当前政权工作中的一个重要问题。
