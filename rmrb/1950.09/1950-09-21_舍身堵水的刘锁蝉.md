Liu Suochan, Who Sacrificed Himself to Block the Water

In Sa County, Suiyuan, whenever Liu Suochan is mentioned, people will think of his heroic deed of "sacrificing himself to block the water."

That was in August 1946, when the Yellow River swelled, and there were already three breaches, large and small, in the river embankment near the village, with water pouring in. The situation was extremely critical. Liu Suochan immediately mobilized the entire village to rush to the rescue. When people arrived there, they saw the water flowing even more violently and were too afraid to act. Liu Suochan shouted to everyone, "If the water overflows, everything will be over, folks! This is not the time to wait!" He immediately jumped into the water himself. The current was so strong that it knocked him over, and he swallowed two mouthfuls of muddy water, but he still crawled out regardless and jumped in again, desperately filling with firewood and pressing down the soil. Hundreds of people were moved by his heroic actions and shouted to follow him, and soon all three breaches were blocked. Afterwards, people said, "If it weren't for Liu Suochan working like he didn't care for his life, one hundred and fifty houses and more than a thousand dan of grain would have floated into the sea long ago."

In the summer of 1949, the Yellow River flooded again, and the water was very fierce. The river embankment was again in critical condition. Again, Liu Suochan braved the danger of the flood, took the lead in going into the water, and organized the villagers to rush to repair the embankment, protecting thirteen li of the embankment and saving the residents along the embankment from the flood. He was injured in this rescue, and to this day there is still a glorious scar on his foot—a ganglion.

In the life-and-death struggle with the Yellow River, Liu Suochan gradually gained a lot of experience. In previous embankment repairs, he either actively participated in the labor or helped determine the embankment line, design the embankment's cross-section, and was able to point out construction methods for dangerous sections. Facts have proved that his plans were accurate. This summer, the People's Government built a new embankment on the left bank of the Yellow River. Liu Suochan first assisted the technical personnel sent by the government in surveying and constructing the line, and then led everyone to dig one hundred and fifty cubic meters of earth, playing a significant role in building the dam. Later, he organized a twenty-eight-person embankment patrol team to repair any damage immediately. To consolidate the embankment, he plans to mobilize the masses this autumn to plant trees on the dam and sow a large amount of trifoliate orange grass.

Indeed, Liu Suochan's contribution is not small, but he did not feel satisfied. He never took credit for himself. He said, "Even a hero needs help, I'm just one of the crowd. Without everyone's efforts, there would be no achievements." In several embankment protection and rescue operations, he showed extraordinary heroism and was good at uniting and leading the masses, making remarkable achievements.

Liu Suochan is from the Second District of Sa County, Suiyuan. He is forty-nine years old this year. He grew up in Zhou Siheyingzi Village, more than two li away from the Yellow River. He is of middle peasant background. This time, he was selected as a representative of Suiyuan to attend the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Peasants, and Soldiers for his active production and achievements in harnessing the Yellow River.

　　舍身堵水的刘锁蝉
    在绥远萨县，有人提起刘锁蝉来，就会想起他“舍身堵水”的一段英勇事迹来。
    那是一九四六年八月，黄河涨水，村庄附近的河堤已经有大小三处缺口涌进水来。事情非常危急，刘锁蝉立刻动员全村的人赶去抢险。人们赶到那里，看见水流的更大了，吓得都不敢动手。刘锁蝉向大家喊道：“水一出槽一切都完了，乡亲们！不是等的时候啦！”他自己立刻就跳进水去。水流的太猛，把他打的翻了一个筋斗，喝了两口泥水，但他还是不顾一切的爬出来又跳进去，拼命的填柴压土。几百人被他的英勇行动感动了，一齐叫喊着跟上去，很快的把三个缺口都堵住了。事后人们都说：“要不是人家刘锁蝉不要命的干，一百五十间房子和一千多担粮食早漂到海里去了。”
    一九四九年夏天，黄河泛滥，水势很凶，河堤又很危急，也是刘锁蝉冒着大水危险带头下水，组织全村老乡抢修堤身，保住了十三里的堤坝，使沿堤居民免于水患。他在这次抢险中受了伤，至今他的脚上还有一个光荣的伤痕——筋瘤。
    刘锁蝉在和黄河作生死斗争中，慢慢摸索到了许多经验。在以往几次修堤坝中，他不是积极的参加劳动，就是帮助确定堤线，设计堤的断面，并能指出险工地段的施工办法。事实证明，他的计划是精确的。今年夏天，人民政府修筑黄河左岸新堤，刘锁蝉首先协助政府派来的技术人员定线施工，接着又带着大家挖了一百五十个土方，在修坝当中起了很大作用。后来他又组织了二十八人的堤坝巡防队，发现损坏，马上修补。为了巩固堤坝，他准备今秋发动群众在坝上普遍栽树，并大量撒种枳机草。
    的确，刘锁蝉的功劳是不小的，但他并没有感到满足，他向来不以功自居，他说：“好汉不及人手多，我只不过是众人里头的一个，没有大家的努力，也就没有我的成绩。”在几次护堤抢险中，他都表现异常英勇，并善于团结带动群众，作出显著的成绩。
    刘锁蝉是绥远萨县二区人，今年四十九岁，从小生长在离黄河二里多地的周四和营子村，中农成份，这次以积极生产和治黄有功，被选为绥远出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表。
