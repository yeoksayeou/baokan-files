Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 8th: The East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army have selected sixty-four combat hero representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Among the heroes selected are Liu Kuiji, a first-class people's hero of East China who attended the Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in 1949; Zhang Ming, an excellent commander and first-class combat hero who led his troops to be the first to break through the enemy's fifteen solid fortifications in the east gate during the Luoyang Campaign; Dai Xianyun, a first-class people's hero of East China who fought repeatedly with the enemy for seven days and seven nights in the Yu-dong Campaign; model political worker and first-class people's hero of East China, Zhou Wenjiang, as well as engineering hero Xing Quanli, artillery hero Wang Gongyi, and tank shooting hero Shen Xu, among others. The Shandong, Subei, and North Anhui Military Regions have also selected nine militia hero representatives, including the famous militia combat hero and outstanding demolition expert Zuo Taichuan, and female militia combat hero Sun Yumin.

　　When various units held hero model conferences, they enthusiastically launched a movement to respect heroes and learn from heroes. Commanders and fighters from various units sent their production achievements to the conference as gifts. They also wrote many congratulatory letters expressing their respect for the heroes. A letter from a certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison stated: "We swear to learn from you. We are determined to create more hero models in the battle to liberate Taiwan and strive to meet our Chairman Mao at the next National Combat Hero Representative Conference." Some units also wrote letters to the heroes reporting on their achievements in military training, combat, production, and study this summer, as well as their individual or collective meritorious service plans for the fall. Many units have already used the deeds of the heroes as teaching materials for recent political and cultural studies. When the hero models arrived and departed from various units, commanders and fighters and the masses in various places held grand welcome and send-off rallies. Leaders of various units personally presented flowers to the hero models. At the conferences, the hero models unanimously expressed that they would respond to everyone's love and respect by making greater contributions to the people. Zhang Ming, a first-class combat hero, said on behalf of all the hero models at the hero model conference of a certain army: "Our glory today is the glory of the Communist Party and the glory of all comrades in the army. We will humbly learn from fraternal units at this meeting and better complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan."
