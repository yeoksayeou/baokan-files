Hunan's Experience in Rectifying Farmers' Associations
    By our reporter Li Wen
    The work of rectifying farmers' associations in Hunan Province began as early as May in some advanced counties. For example, in counties such as Changsha, on the basis of the victory in the rent reduction struggle, a mass inspection and summary were carried out in a timely manner, while consolidating and strengthening the ranks of farmers. In June and July, when the production and famine relief were in a critical juncture, all localities went all out to prevent floods and droughts. Individual counties and districts also reorganized the farmers' association organizations in combination with the central work. Most counties carried out the work in late July or early August, in combination with the famine relief or autumn harvest work. At present, in dozens of counties such as Changde, Xiangyin, Ningxiang, Shaoyang, and Lingling, the work of systematically rectifying farmers' associations with leadership is underway. The preliminary experience of Changsha, Changde, Ningxiang and other places in rectifying farmers' association organizations is introduced as follows:
    Further Mobilizing the Masses is the Central Key
    This spring, a large-scale rent reduction movement involving tens of millions of people was launched in Hunan Province. More than five million farmers were initially organized, hitting the feudal forces. Farmers gained 400 million catties of grain in rent reduction, and successfully survived the severe spring and summer famine. However, due to the rapid development of the movement, short time, and rough work, some illegal landlords and bullies took the opportunity to infiltrate the farmers' associations, resulting in serious impurity of farmers' association organizations in some areas. Bad elements infiltrated the farmers' associations, on the one hand, distorting policies and shielding landlords; on the other hand, undermining peasant unity and infringing upon the interests of middle peasants. For example, Qiu Bingzhao, a lackey of the landlord in the Fourth District of Xiangyin, usurped the power of the farmers' association and issued release slips for the big landlord Qiu Sifu to go to Hengyang to avoid rent reduction, but sealed up the granaries of middle peasants and forcibly borrowed more than 120 piculs of grain, causing chaos among the peasants. For example, the Hexi Township Farmers' Association in Taoyuan County, Changde Prefecture, which was controlled by bad elements, not only did illegal landlords fail to hand over the rent grain that should have been returned, but some big landlords, such as Wang Rongguang, used the method of "exchanging grain for land" to earn more than a thousand dan of grain. The impurity of the farmer ranks is thus hindering the implementation of correct policies.
    The peasants, who have initially awakened, are urgently demanding the rectification of the farmers' associations. Li Zhengeng, a farmer in Shutang Township, Xiangyin, went to the county to request the removal of the township farmers' association chairman who shielded the landlord and unfairly distributed the fruits; many farmers wrote anonymous letters to the county and district farmers' associations to complain. Some said painfully: "Sending someone to investigate and deal with it is a clear sky, not coming to deal with it is confused."
    Therefore, earnestly rectifying the farmers' association organizations and consolidating and expanding the ranks of farmers has become the central key to further mobilizing the peasants, implementing rent reduction and preparing for land reform. Failure to grasp this link will put a series of tasks such as the autumn tax collection, the implementation of rent reduction, and land reform in a passive position.
    Starting from Summarizing and Checking Work to Rectify Farmers' Associations
    The basic experience of rectifying the farmers' associations is: starting from inspecting and summarizing work, mobilizing the masses, and launching a mass "investigation and evaluation"; improving class consciousness from the criticism of the masses on their own experiences and specific materials; and on the basis of improving the consciousness of the masses, purifying, developing and expanding the ranks of farmers.
    When starting to rectify the farmers' associations, it is first necessary to be good at analyzing the situation and adopting different specific steps and methods according to different types of villages. Before the rectification, due to the unbalanced development of the rent reduction movement, the organizational status of the farmers' associations in various counties and the depth of mobilizing the masses were different, but the basic status of the farmers' association organizations can be roughly divided into three types: The first type of township (equivalent to the northern administrative village) has leading backbones, relatively pure composition, high mass awareness, and more thorough rent reduction. This type of farmers' association accounts for about 15% to 20% of the total number of farmers' associations; the second type of township has a partially impure leading composition, low mass awareness, and incomplete rent reduction, accounting for about 50% to 60% of the total number of farmers' associations; the third type of township has a seriously impure farmers' association organization, with landlords, bullies and their agents infiltrating the farmers' association, or usurping the leadership of the farmers' association, accounting for about 20% of the total number. For the rectification of the first and second types of township farmers' associations: District cadres first conduct a review of the work in the past period from the leadership at the farmers' association committee, dispel concerns, solicit opinions, and start discussions, talk about achievements, talk about shortcomings, and guide everyone to conduct self-criticism and mutual criticism, and make a preliminary summary of the work of the whole township; then convene a township farmers' congress to solicit opinions from representatives to make the summary more complete; then conduct dissemination among all members of the township, conduct group discussions and supplementary opinions. After this mass summary work, the awareness of the farmers' association members has been improved, and on this basis, a farmers' association member meeting is convened to review and wash away individual bad elements who have infiltrated the farmers' association, absorb upright farmers into the association, democratically elect township farmers' association members, and improve the collective leadership and various systems of the farmers' association committee. As for the fake farmers' associations controlled by landlords and their agents, the majority of members of the fake farmers' associations and some of the better members who are threatened and lured by bad elements should be strictly separated from a small number of bad elements. They should be patiently educated to get rid of the influence of bad elements. At the same time, they should go deep into the masses, discover and cultivate activists, and when the farmers form a considerable force, the leadership can prepare to announce the dissolution of the old farmers' association committee (but never kick away all the members of the fake farmers' association, turning the fake farmers' association into an opposing group, which will greatly facilitate the landlords' provocation and sabotage activities), and unite the better farmers in the old farmers' association to organize a temporary farmers' congress, further mobilize the masses, and launch a struggle against the main landlord elements who are hated by the masses and control the fake farmers' association, and rectify the farmers' association organization on the basis of summarizing the victory of the struggle.
    Experience has proved that when starting the summary work, it is necessary to clearly put forward the purpose of the summary work, but also be good at starting from the development of the masses' thinking and gradually guiding them. The usual rule for farmers' association members to meet to check their work is to start with one question, and then link to other related questions, slowly unfolding discussions, debates, and criticisms. It is important to note that when checking the work, do not only look for shortcomings, first affirm the achievements of the struggle, so that the members are full of enthusiasm, and at the same time, you can increase the courage to review the shortcomings. The general experience is that it usually starts from the grain problem (which is precisely the focus of the struggle between landlords and peasants in the rent reduction movement), from how much fruit is obtained, to the new scene after liberation, the reasons for turning over, and other issues. Farmers who have experienced the rent reduction struggle generally realize that the turning over is due to the good leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party, but often do not see the power of "organization." At this time, we should guide the masses to discuss: "Under the same government, why is rent reduction thorough in some townships and not thorough in others?" thereby pointing out that this is because the farmers' associations are good or bad, so that the masses realize the power of organization and the importance of running the farmers' associations well. Analyze "Is rent reduction thorough?" and let everyone calculate how much rent the landlord should reduce? How much grain did the farmers actually get? What tricks did the landlord play in rent reduction? From analyzing the landlord's tricks, recognize the cunning face of the landlord class and improve the class consciousness of the peasants: "Where are our own problems in the incomplete rent reduction?" Guide the farmers' association members to check the implementation of the policy. When a certain problem is clarified, or the members' thinking is improved and enlightened, it can often cause the members to contact themselves, conduct reviews and start mutual criticism. After such inspection and discussion, the materials inspected by the members can be collected to make a preliminary summary of the work of the whole township, and then discussed and supplemented at the representative meeting and group meeting. This method of starting from the top to the bottom, starting from checking and summarizing work, first checking the leading backbone, and gradually deepening the rectification of the organization has three obvious advantages: First, the preliminary summary of the work of the whole township has a greater effect because it focuses on exposing the tricks of the landlords in the township to resist rent reduction and uses concrete facts to enlighten and educate the masses. Secondly, because the chairman and members of the farmers' association took the lead in reviewing from the top to the bottom, it dispelled the concerns of the masses and encouraged the masses to dare to boldly put forward their opinions. Thirdly, most of the members have improved their awareness after criticism and review, and there are backbones in the group discussions. In this way, it is easy to form a mass inspection and summary work with leadership and backbone; and this process of mass inspection and summary work is also a process of improving and educating the masses.
    Some cadres have a vague understanding of the purpose of rectifying the farmers' associations; or they have not seriously understood the spirit of "starting from checking work, mobilizing the masses, and rectifying the farmers' association organization on the basis of improving awareness," resulting in some deviations and errors in the work: Some comrades understand the rectification of the farmers' association organization as "rectifying village cadres," not affirming the achievements of the farmers' association members in leading the struggle, kicking them away or one-sidedly looking for the shortcomings of the farmers' association cadres, promoting the farmers' association cadres' anxiety and emotional opposition, and becoming more and more afraid to expose shortcomings, and in low spirits and full of complaints. This one-sided practice of looking for shortcomings of village cadres is also easy for bad elements to take advantage of to attack the activists in the struggle. In addition, some comrades regard the rectification of the farmers' association as a simple washing, re-election, and establishment of systems, abandon the arduous and in-depth mass work, and even rashly wash away members in large numbers, which is also very harmful and dangerous. For example, the district cadres of Yihe Township in the Sixth District of Xiangyin listened to the opinions of individual people, subjectively reviewed and circled the good and bad of the members, and checked it in a formalistic manner at the mass meeting, so that bad elements could take advantage of it, so that Wu Zemei, a soldier and ruffian who shielded the landlord, and Xu Mingying, a pseudo-baolizhang, could be elected as township cadres. Another example is Li Guo, a district cadre of Duli Township in Wugang County, who rashly decided to wash away 102 members at a liaison meeting of farmers' association members and group leaders, and ordered the groups to go back and do the same, causing dissatisfaction among the majority of members, and bad elements took the opportunity to incite riots.
    Three Issues Worth Noting
    1. Rectifying the farmers' association organization is a serious and complex struggle, which will encounter serious resistance from landlords and saboteurs, or try their best to create sectarian disputes. It is necessary to carry out the reorganization of the organization under the clear goal of striving for thorough turning over, and always be vigilant against the various conspiracies of the landlords, and strictly prevent internal quarrels among the peasants, forming class confusion. The mistakes made by the pure peasants due to their low awareness and the sabotage activities of the bad elements must be strictly distinguished. For the former, it is necessary to patiently educate and help them correct them; for the few landlord elements and their agents who specialize in sabotage, we must adopt a firm policy of cleaning them up.
    2. Reorganizing the farmers' association organization should greatly use the farmers' congresses at all levels. The key is to hold the district farmers' congress well. At the district farmers' congress, the district responsible cadres should make a report reviewing the work of the entire district, solicit opinions and start discussions, and guide the representatives to learn to use criticism and self-criticism and the method of checking and summarizing work to explain the purpose, method, and steps of rectifying the farmers' association organization to the representatives present, so that they become the backbone force of rectifying the farmers' association organization, so as to lead and promote the mass inspection and summary work movement in various townships. At the same time, it is necessary to concentrate a group of cadres, select key points, combine the district and township representative meetings, and mobilize the masses systematically and deeply from points to areas, create experience, enrich the content of the farmers' congress, and guide the work of general villages. It is not right to reorganize the organization by guarding a point with small hands and small feet. It is not easy to reorganize the farmers' association organization only by using the farmers' congress without in-depth and meticulous work.
    3. After the farmers' association organization is initially reorganized, the collective leadership of the farmers' association members should be established in a timely manner, clearly divide the work, and formulate a system. In the implementation of the system, in the work, pay attention to the training of township farmers' association cadres, and further consolidate the results of reorganizing the farmers' association. At the committee and representative meetings, district cadres should specifically help them analyze problems, study methods, and make correct resolutions; then go deep into the groups with the members at the same time, discuss problems together, and help solve specific difficulties in the work; if deviations are found in the resolutions of the farmers' association during the work, the district cadres should not arbitrarily change the resolutions, but can suggest to the committee, explain the advantages and disadvantages, mobilize everyone to study, and seek a correct solution to facilitate the work. It is necessary to overcome the work style of the county and district cadres taking on everything, so that the township farmers' association cadres can gradually get rid of their dependence on the superiors, exercise their own abilities, and give full play to greater work enthusiasm.

　　湖南整顿农协的经验
    本报记者  力文
    湖南整顿农民协会的工作，某些工作先进县份早在五月间已经开始。如长沙等县在减租斗争胜利的基础上，便及时的进行了群众性的检查总结，同时巩固与壮大了农民队伍。六、七月间正值生产度荒的紧急关头，各地全力进行防汛抗旱，也有个别县、区结合中心工作，整理了农协组织的，多数县份则是在七月末或八月初，结合度荒或秋收工作进行的。目前常德、湘阴、宁乡、邵阳、零陵等数十县，有领导的系统的整顿农协工作正在进行。现将长沙、常德、宁乡等地，初步整顿农协组织工作的经验，介绍如下：
    进一步发动群众的中心关键
    今春，湖南全省掀起了千万人参加的规模宏大的减租运动，五百余万农民初步组织起来，打击了封建势力，农民在减租中获得四亿斤粮食，胜利度过严重的春荒、夏荒。但由于运动发展迅速、时间短、工作粗糙，有些不法地主恶霸分子，乘机混入农会，以致部分地区农协组织严重不纯。坏分子混入农协，一面歪曲政策，包庇地主；一面破坏农民团结，侵犯中农利益。如湘阴四区地主的狗腿子仇炳照，篡夺农会大权后，替大地主仇四福打放行条子，去衡阳躲避减租，却又查封中农谷仓，强借谷一百二十石，造成农民中的混乱。如坏分子把持下的常德专区桃源县赫曦乡农会，不但不法地主未交出应退的租谷，有些大地主如王荣光反而用“以谷抵田”的办法，赚谷千余担。农民队伍的不纯，是这样障碍着正确政策的执行。
    有了初步觉悟的农民，对于整顿农协组织的要求是迫切的。湘阴塾塘乡农民李振庚等到县要求撤换包庇地主、分配果实不公的乡农协主席；不少农民写匿名信向县、区农协控告。有的沉痛的说：“派人调查处理是青天，不来处理是糊涂。”
    因之，认真整顿农协组织，巩固与壮大农民队伍，便成为进一步发动农民，贯彻减租和准备土地改革的中心关键。不抓紧这一环，会使秋征、贯彻减租、土地改革等一系列工作，陷于被动的境地。
    从总结检查工作入手整顿农协组织
    整顿农协的基本经验是：从检查总结工作入手，发动群众，展开群众性“查评”；从群众对自身经历、具体材料的批判中，提高阶级觉悟；在群众觉悟提高的基础上，使农民队伍得到纯洁、发展与壮大。
    着手整顿农协时，首先要善于分析情况，根据不同类型的村庄，采取不同的具体步骤与方法。整顿以前，由于减租运动发展的不平衡，各县农协组织状况，与发动群众的深度，有所不同，但农协组织的基本状况，大致可分为三种类型：一类乡（等于北方的行政村）是有领导骨干，成份较纯洁，群众觉悟较高，减租亦较彻底，此类农协约占农协总数的百分之十五到二十；二类乡，领导成份部分不纯，群众觉悟不高，减租不彻底，约占农协总数百分之五十到六十；三类乡，农协组织严重不纯，地主恶霸及其代理人混进农协，或篡夺了农协的领导权，约占总数百分之二十左右。一、二类乡的农协整顿：区干部首先在农协委员会上，把过去一段工作，从领导上进行检讨，解除顾虑，征求意见，展开讨论，谈成绩，谈缺点，引导大家进行自我检讨，和互相批评，做出全乡工作初步总结；进一步便召开乡农代会，征求代表意见，使总结更加充实；然后在全乡会员中进行传达，分小组讨论与补充意见。经过这种群众性的总结工作，农协委员、会员的觉悟提高后，就在这个基础上，召开农协会员大会，审查与洗刷个别混入农协的坏分子，吸收正派农民入会，民主选举乡农协委员，健全农协委员会的集体领导与各种制度。至于对于地主及其代理人控制的假农协，则应把假农协中的多数会员，和受坏分子威胁利诱的某些成份较好的委员，与少数坏分子严格分开。对他们应进行耐心的教育，使他们摆脱坏分子的影响。同时一面深入群众，发现与培养积极分子，当农民形成相当力量后，领导上即可有准备的宣布解散旧的农会委员会（但决不能一脚踢开假农会的一切委员、会员，把假农会变成一个对立的集团，这样就会大大便利地主的挑拨破坏活动），并团结旧农会中较好的农民，组织临时农代会，进一步发动群众，向为群众所痛恨、控制假农协的主要地主分子，展开斗争，在总结斗争胜利的基础上进行整顿农协组织。
    经验证明，开始总结工作时，必须明确提出总结工作的目的，而又要善于从群众思想发展的状况出发，加以逐步诱导。农协委员开会检查工作，通常规律是先从一个问题谈起，然后联系到其他有关连的问题，慢慢展开讨论、争辩、批评。要注意，在检查工作时，不要光找缺点，首先要肯定斗争成绩，使委员们情绪饱满，同时也可以增加检讨缺点的勇气。一般经验，通常总是从粮食问题（这正是减租运动中，地主与农民斗争的焦点）扯起，从得到多少果实，联系到解放后的新光景，翻身的原因等问题。经过减租斗争的农民，大体都认识到翻身是人民政府和共产党的领导好，而往往看不到“组织起来”的力量。这时，应引导群众讨论：“在同一个政府下，为什么有的乡减租彻底，有的就不彻底？”从而指出，这是因为农协有好有坏，使群众认识到组织起来的力量和办好农会的重要。分析“减租彻底不彻底？”让大家计算地主应减租多少？农民实得粮多少？减租中地主耍了那些花样？从分析地主的花样，认清地主阶级的狡滑面目，提高农民的阶级自觉：“减租不彻底，我们自己的毛病在那里？”引导农协委员检查政策贯彻情形。当某个问题明确之后，或委员思想上得到提高和启发后，经常可以引起委员们联系自己，进行检讨和展开相互间的批评。经过这样检查讨论后，即可汇集各委员检查出的材料，做出全乡工作初步总结，然后再在代表会、小组会上进行讨论补充。这种自上而下，从检查总结工作入手，首先检查领导骨干，逐步深入整顿组织的方法，有三个明显的好处：第一、全乡工作的初步总结，因集中揭发了本乡地主抵抗减租的花样，用具体事实进行启发教育群众，收效较大。其次，由于首先是农协主席、委员，自上而下的带头检讨，解除了群众顾虑，鼓励群众敢于大胆提出意见。第三、多数委员经过批评检讨，觉悟提高，在小组讨论中有了骨干。这样就易于形成有领导有骨干的群众性检查总结工作；而这一群众性检查总结工作的过程，也正是提高教育群众的过程。
    部分干部对整顿农协的目的性，认识模糊；或者没有认真体会“从检查工作入手，发动群众，在觉悟提高的基础上，整顿农协组织”的精神，以致工作中产生若干偏差和错误：有些同志把整顿农协组织，理解为“整村干”，不肯定农协委员领导斗争的成绩，一脚踢开或片面的寻找农协干部的缺点，促成农协干部的不安和情绪上的对立，越发不敢暴露缺点，情绪低落，满腹牢骚。这种片面寻找村干缺点的做法，也易被坏分子钻空子，借以打击斗争中的积极分子。另外，一些同志把整顿农协看成为简单的洗刷、改选、建立制度，放弃艰苦深入的群众工作，甚至轻率的大批洗刷会员，也是十分有害而危险的。如湘阴六区义合乡的区干部，听信个别人的意见，主观的审查和圈定会员的好坏，在群众大会上形式主义的检查一下，使坏分子有机可乘，以致包庇地主的兵痞吴择美，伪保长许明英得以当选为乡干部。又如武岗县独立乡的区干部李国，在一次农协委员、组长联系会上，轻率决定洗刷一百零二名会员，并命令各组回去照办，引起广大会员不满，坏分子乘机煽起骚动。
    值得注意的三个问题
    一、整顿农协组织是一个严重复杂的斗争，会遇到地主、破坏分子的严重抵抗，或极力制造宗派纠纷。必须在争取彻底翻身的明确目标下，进行整理组织，始终警惕地主的各种阴谋，严防农民内部争吵，形成阶级混乱。对纯洁农民由于觉悟不高而产生的某些错误与坏分子的破坏行为要严加区别，对于前者必须耐心教育，帮助他们纠正；对少数专事破坏的地主分子及其代理人，则必须采取坚决清洗的方针。
    二、整理农协组织，应大大运用各级农代会。关键在于开好区农代会。在区农代大会上，区负责干部做好检讨全区工作的报告，征求意见并展开讨论，诱导代表学会用批评与自我批评、检查总结工作的方法，把整顿农协组织的目的、方法、步骤，向到会代表交代清楚，使他们成为整顿农协组织的骨干力量，以领导与推动各乡群众性的检查总结工作运动。同时必须集中一批干部，选择重点，结合区、乡代表会，由点到面，系统深入的发动群众，创造经验，丰富农代会的内容与指导一般村的工作。小手小脚孤守一点的整理组织是不对的，只运用农代会，而没有深入细致的工作，亦不易把农协组织整理好。
    三、农协组织初步整理以后，应及时建立农协委员的集体领导，明确分工，订出制度。在执行制度上，在工作中，注意对乡农协干部的培养，进一步巩固整理农协的成果。在委员会、代表会上，区干部应具体帮助他们分析问题，研究办法，做出正确决议；然后和委员们同时深入小组，遇到问题一齐商量，帮助解决工作中的具体困难；如在工作进行中发现农协会的决议有偏差，区干部不应随便更改决议，可向委员会建议，说明利害，发动大家研究，求得正确解决，以利工作。要注意克服县、区干部包办代替的作风，才可能使乡农协干部逐步去掉对上级的依赖，锻炼自身能力，发挥更高的工作积极性。
