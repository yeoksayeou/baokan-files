    The opening of the National Representative Meeting of Combat Heroes, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, is an event of historical significance. The commanders and fighters of our Central South troops are all excited and honored by the convening of this meeting. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and with the active support of the people of the whole country, our People's Liberation Army has gone through more than four years of the great Liberation War, annihilating more than eight million Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops supported by American imperialism, liberating all the territory except Taiwan and Tibet, and making itself a powerful and invincible force in defeating enemies at home and abroad. The attainment of this great victory is inseparable from your leading and exemplary roles in combat and daily work. Your bravery, your enthusiasm and wisdom have encouraged the troops and educated every commander and fighter, enabling them to learn from you and to complete combat and work tasks together with you. In order for our People's Liberation Army to continue to be strong in order to defend the independence of the motherland, we have to do a lot of work, one of which is extremely important and related to you, is how to further develop revolutionary heroism in the troops, because the widespread and highly developed revolutionary heroism is a kind of living education, which will form an immeasurable spiritual force. We hope that you will discuss this, summarize the past experience well, and draw new conclusions.

    I wish the conference success and the comrades health and happiness.

    Lin Biao, Commander of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army
    Political Commissars Luo Ronghuan, Deng Zihui, Tan Zheng and all commanders and fighters respectfully congratulate you. September 19th.
    Original telegram to the Labor Model Representatives as follows:
    To the Presidium of the National Representative Meeting of Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Models and all the representatives:

    On the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of our great People's Republic of China, you, the outstanding labor models from workers, peasants and soldiers on the production front from all over the country, are holding a meeting in the capital Beijing under the direct leadership of the State Council of the Central People's Government. This meeting will specifically summarize the experiences of various production and construction projects, and discuss how to effectively develop and organize the production enthusiasm of workers and other working people, actively engage in production and participate in national economic construction in the future construction tasks of our country, so as to ensure the implementation of the national plan. Therefore, the significance of this meeting is very significant. The war on the Chinese mainland has basically ended, the national financial and economic situation has begun to improve, the land reform work in the vast new areas is being gradually implemented, and the great unity of the people of the whole country is progressing by leaps and bounds. Therefore, the conditions for developing production and building the country have been met, and a good start has already been made in the old areas. This is the achievement of Chairman Mao's wise policies and the leadership of the Central People's Government, and the result of the heroic battles of the People's Liberation Army, the concerted efforts of the working class, the working people and patriotic democratic people across the country. We believe that with the efforts of the comrades, the wounds of our country can be healed quickly, and the industry, agriculture and other production undertakings of our country will be quickly developed and fully restored. We can not only destroy the rule of the old China, but also have the strength to build a bright, prosperous and strong new China.

    I wish the conference success and everyone health and happiness.

    Lin Biao, Commander of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army
    Political Commissars Luo Ronghuan, Deng Zihui, Tan Zheng and all commanders and fighters respectfully congratulate you. September 25th
