　　Hao Qingshan, the Militia Hero Who Terrified the Enemy
    Shang Zhansi
  A Heroic Story Like a Myth

　　Comrade Hao Qingshan is from Hao Baitu Village, Ding County, Hebei Province, and is currently thirty-five years old. He joined the work in 1942 and the Party in 1943. For the past eight or nine years, whether it was the Japanese devils or the Chiang bandit troops, they were very troubled by him. The Japanese army in Ding County once offered a reward of 2 million yuan to capture him. In 1944, he was elected as a combat hero of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region; in 1945, he was elected as a labor-military (production and combat) hero; in 1946, he attended the Labor-Military Hero Conference of the Ji-Jin Military Region and participated in the presidium of the conference; this time, he was again elected as a militia hero to attend the National Model Hero Representative Conference.

　　His family is poor peasant, and he and his wife live together. He is a small, independent household in the village. When he joined the work, the environment was very brutal, with eight Japanese blockhouses surrounding the village. He hated the enemy's oppression and was once caught and severely tortured in prison for distributing anti-Japanese propaganda and stealing bullets from trains, but he always persisted tenaciously and did not expose the anti-Japanese organization.

　　Thus, under the threat of enemy whips and bayonets, and under the education and cultivation of the Party, he developed courage, composure, and alertness; his glorious achievements and heroic stories, at first hearing, are simply like myths.

　　He first became famous for dealing with traitors and secret agents. He served as the village's security officer. The village was only three li away from the enemy's Wangzhuang Railway Station and only one li away from the Zhibaitu Village blockhouse. Traitors and secret agents inevitably wandered around the village. He once had village cadres boil eggs and peel them for a special agent to eat, but he suddenly went up and grabbed the agent, disarming him of his quick-firing gun; he once suddenly lifted the door curtain and used a gun to hold up a puppet army squad leader and a puppet soldier who were sitting in the room eating, forcing them to raise their hands and surrender their weapons; he investigated the residence of a die-hard secret agent during the day, and at night, disguised as an acquaintance of the agent, tricked him into opening the door and killed him on the spot; he led four guerrillas, sneaked into Ding County city at night, and chopped off the head of the worst secret agent squad leader; he also chopped to death the Japanese translator and another secret agent in their residence at the railway station, and captured the puppet tax bureau chief from Ding County's city gate… By doing this, he not only scared the traitors and secret agents at Wangzhuang Railway Station into moving away one after another, but also made the enemies in the city feel frightened and uneasy day and night.

  A Monkey King in the Enemy's Entrails

　　His courage, determination, and alertness are prominently demonstrated in many critical situations: One night, he seized more than forty sheep from the enemy's security army. The enemy suddenly rushed into the Tang Village (under the jurisdiction of Dingnan County) elementary school where they were staying. Bayonets stretched in from the window eyes and the door, piercing his shoulder clothes, but he did not panic at all. He was quick-witted and fast-handed, fired several shots in a row, picked up the hand grenades thrown in by the enemy, and threw them outside the door to explode; he and two guerrillas fought back the enemy to the street, covering three district cadres to jump over the wall and break through the encirclement; after breaking out, the district cadres lost their documents and stamps, and he broke back in to find the things, and then broke out again a second time.

　　He is good at using surprise attack tactics. He often braves great danger to carry out activities in the enemy's heartland; as he himself said: "When the enemy 'sweeps' our border areas, I must sweep the enemy's interior!" He often haunts the enemy's strongholds and has become a Monkey King in the enemy's entrails.

　　He jumped onto a moving train at night and used a gun to force the sleepy-eyed enemy to the door, and pushed him off the train with force; he sneaked into the city to bring out the landlord steward who opposed rent reduction and interest reduction; he broke into the station telephone room and used a gun to force the puppet personnel to take away the enemy's telephone; he suddenly attacked the enemy's heartland, secretly convened small meetings of three or two households to publicize current affairs and our policies. …

　　The Japanese devils on the Beizhuangzi blockhouse were frantically robbing passers-by; ordinary people passing by on both sides of the railway had to leave behind even a little salt for the enemy. After he reconnoitered the situation clearly and knew that the devils had gone to the city to take a bath, he and three guerrillas put on glasses, leather shoes, and long gowns (shirts), disguised themselves as the enemy's special agent team; they walked into the seven- or eight-zhang-high blockhouse in a grand manner. When the sentry asked them "What are you doing?", they even glared at him and cursed a few words; in this way, they walked up to the sentry, questioned him face to face, and took advantage of his unpreparedness to seize his gun, hold up the enemy in the room on top of the blockhouse, and take down this blockhouse.

  Whether Day or Night, the Thunder of Hao Qingshan Resounds Everywhere

　　His blasting technique is also very famous. He often leads his team with a spirit of selfless devotion, overcoming various difficulties, and successfully completing the arduous blasting tasks given by the higher authorities.

　　In September 1945, he led two guerrillas and was ordered to blow up the Tanghe Bridge. When they were several miles away from the bridge, they took off their clothes and went into the water, put the 170-jin explosive box in a pineapple, and tied the pineapple to a ladder, floating it on the water and pushing it forward. The water was so cold that it pierced to the bone, and they shivered all over. They walked and hid in the water, slowly approaching the bridge; they could hear the sound of the devils' sentry walking on the bridge very clearly. After igniting the explosives, the bridge collapsed, and the guns on the water were firing very intensely. They all dived into the cold water, and when they came out, they ran back in one breath, their bodies were numb with cold. He suffered from malaria for more than twenty days and developed asthma after this incident.

　　Blowing up railways was even more their daily routine. They once challenged the engineering platoon of the troops: not only did they guarantee three thunderclaps every night, destroying three places on the railway; but they also guaranteed that the landmines would sound during the day. They disguised themselves as grass cutters during the day, put the landmines in grass baskets, and went to places without enemy sentries to blast them.

　　After Japan surrendered, in order to prevent the Chiang bandit troops from going north to create a civil war, they received the task of blowing up locomotives. At that time, he served as the militia company commander and had blown up the enemy's locomotives three times. Many times, he personally reconnoitered and held the mine; one night, he held the mine to blow up the locomotive in front of the ticket office, and was discovered by the enemy sentry. He cleverly answered the enemy: "I am from the car, going over there to buy chickens." (There were some small businesses on the other side of the station) and mixed through; then later, the mine did not detonate, and the fuse was broken by the team members. He did not hesitate to touch the station a second time, drilled under the locomotive, and reconnected the fuse.

  Beautiful Village Defense War

　　His village defense war was especially well fought! In June 1946, the Chiang bandit troops in Ding County surrounded their village with a battalion of troops. He led the militia to defend the high houses and opened fire with the enemy; the high house fortifications were destroyed, and they moved into the tunnels to continue fighting; the entrances of the dark rooms and caves in the tunnels were all set on fire by the enemy. Taking advantage of the enemy going to the street to set fires and rob things, they twice broke out of the tunnel entrances full of smoke and fire, shot dead two enemies with guns, and pretended to shout: "First platoon charges east! Second platoon charges west! Annihilate the enemy, third platoon charges into the street! No shooting, capture alive!" While he shouted, he and three team members concentrated their big guns and hand grenades to attack the enemy; in this way, with a combination of fighting and scaring, they made the enemy unable to figure out exactly how many of us there were, and they withdrew in a chaotic manner. In this battle, they killed and captured more than twenty enemies, and we had no casualties.

　　After the high house fortifications in the village were destroyed by the enemy, he drew a drawing and led the masses in the entire district to build a earthen fort in the middle of the village: 25 zhang high, 5 chi thick, divided into three layers, using more than 70,000 earthen bricks from 18 villages. His firepower deployment was very meticulous: more than 70 pull-string landmines were buried around the fort, and the fuses were all in the fort, numbered according to the distance of the mines; more than 30 drop-string landmines (a kind of mine that is pulled down by hand) and more than 80 hand grenades were stored on the roof. On August 15, 1946, Ding Ruitai, the regimental commander of the Chiang bandit troops in Ding County, led the entire regiment to take this fort, and said: "If we can't take the Hao Baitu Village fort and can't capture Hao Xiaosuo (Comrade Hao Qingshan's nickname), we will never return to the city!" The enemy concentrated six light machine guns, one heavy machine gun, and two mortars, and fired fiercely at the fort; there were only seven of them (including two old villagers who were guarding the fort and were surrounded inside), five guns. The inside of the fort was full of smoke and dust, choking people and unable to breathe. The soil on their backs was very thick, but they remained calm and fought back; guns fired, hand grenades exploded, and landmines boomed, defeating more than ten enemy charges, killing and wounding 58 enemies. They only sacrificed one team member, creating a brilliant record of one to fifty-eight.

　　In the entire process of fighting the enemy, according to the total account, he and his guerrilla group's main achievements were: killing and wounding more than 60 Japanese devils and Chiang bandit troops, capturing alive 45 traitors and secret agents, killing 13 traitors, blowing up 8 locomotives (he personally blew up 3, and led the militia to blow up 5), blowing up bridges more than 20 times (all successful), seizing 26 long and short guns (including 13 that he personally seized), seizing 8 telephones, and blowing up railways more than 50 times. …

  "Let the American Devils Know Our Power!"

　　He also has outstanding achievements in organizing mass production and armed protection of production: In February 1945, after his repeated and patient publicity and explanation, 14 work allocation groups were established in the entire village, and all 115 households in the village participated except for two households. He also led the masses to dig a two-li-long small river ditch in the north of the village, which can irrigate more than four qing of land, increasing the yield per mu by two dou. He and the district cadres led the construction of three windbreak forests, turning more than ten qing of land in the north of the village that was often affected by wind disasters into fertile fields. Every time the village harvested crops, he also led the militia to carry out armed protection, ensuring quick harvesting, quick fighting, and quick hiding; once, the puppet county chief brought three hundred enemy puppets to his village to rob grain. He flexibly transferred several gun holes for shooting, killing two enemies; the enemy thought they had fallen into his ambush and withdrew in panic, without robbing a single grain.

　　He is now the secretary of the CCP village branch. He was very excited to be nominated to attend the National Model Hero Representative Conference in Beijing! He said with emotion: "This is something that I, a poor peasant, never dreamed of!" He was very indignant at the US imperialist aggression against Korea and Taiwan. He said: "If US imperialism dares to bully our China, I must lead the militia to fight with him, listen to the command of the higher authorities, bring out all the methods, and let the American devils know our power!"

　　吓破敌胆的民兵英雄郝庆山
    商展思
  像神话一样的英雄故事
    郝庆山同志是河北省定县郝白土村人，现年三十五岁。一九四二年参加工作，一九四三年入党，八九年来，不论是日本鬼子或蒋匪军，对他都非常发愁，定县城内的日军曾经悬了二百万元重赏捉拿他。一九四四年当选晋察冀边区的战斗英雄；一九四五年又被选为劳武（生产与战斗）英雄；一九四六年出席冀晋军区劳武英雄大会，参加大会主席团；这次又被选为出席全国英模代表会议的民兵英雄。
    他家是贫农，只他和他老婆两口人过日子，在村里是独门小户。他参加工作那时，环境很残酷，远近八个日本炮楼围着村。他痛恨敌人的压迫，曾经为散发抗日宣传品和上火车偷子弹，被敌人捉到监狱里严刑拷打，但他始终顽强坚持，没有暴露抗日组织。
    就这样，在敌人皮鞭刺刀的威胁下，在党的教育培养下，他锻炼得英勇、沉着和机警；他的那些光辉战绩和英雄故事，乍听起来简直像神话一样。
    他开头是以收拾汉奸特务出名的，他担任本村的治安员，村离敌人王庄车站才三里，离直白土村炮楼才一里，汉奸特务短不了到村里转游。他曾让村干部煮鸡子剥给特务吃，自己却冷不防上去抱住特务，空手夺来了敌人的快枪；他曾经猛然掀开门帘子，用枪逼住正坐在屋里吃饭的伪军小队长和一个伪军，让他们扬起手来缴了械；他白天调查了一个死心特务的住处，晚上伪装特务的熟人把门骗开，把那个特务就地杀死；他带了四个游击队员，夜里摸进定县城，把一个最坏的特务班长砍掉了脑袋；他还把鬼子的翻译官和另一个特务砍死在车站住宅里，把伪税务局长从定县城关里捉出来……他这样一搞，不但把王庄车站上的汉奸特务吓得纷纷搬家，把城里的敌人也闹得心惊胆战，日夜不安生。
  敌人心腹里的孙悟空
    他的勇敢、坚定和机警，突出地表现在许多危急的情况下：一个晚上，他夺了敌人治安军的四十多只羊，敌人突然冲进他们住的唐村（定南县属）小学校，刺刀从窗户眼里和门里伸进来，刺破了他肩上的衣服，但他一点不慌乱，手急眼快，连打几枪，拾起敌人投进来的手榴弹扔到门外边爆炸了；他和两个游击队员把敌人打退到街上，掩护了三个区干部跳墙突围；突出去后，区干部丢了文件和戳子，他又突进去把东西找着，二次再突围出来。
    他善于使用奇袭战术。他常常冒着很大的危险，钻进敌人的心腹地区进行活动；正如他自己说的那样：“敌人‘扫荡’俺们的边区，我非扫荡敌人的内部不可！”他时常出没在敌人的据点里，成了敌人心腹里的孙悟空。
    他黑夜跳上正开着的火车，用枪把睡眼朦胧的敌人逼到车门口，用力把他推下车来；他摸着爬进城去，提出反对减租减息的大地主管家；他闯进车站电话室，用枪逼着伪人员，摘走了敌人的电话机；他突然打到敌人的心腹地区，秘密召开三两户人家的小型会议，宣传时事和我们的政策。……
    北庄子炮楼上的鬼子疯狂劫道；铁路两边过往的老百姓，带点咸盐都得给敌人撂下。他侦察清楚情况，知道鬼子进城洗澡去了，便和三个游击队员，眼镜、皮鞋、大尾巴褂子（衬衣）一穿戴，化装成敌人的特务队；大模大样的走进了那个七八丈高的炮楼，当哨兵问他们“干什么的？”还让他们竖眉瞪眼骂了几句；就这样，他们走到哨兵的跟前，和他面对面问这问那，乘他一个不防备，夺了他的枪，逼住炮台顶上屋内的敌人，拿下这个炮楼。
  不论白天和晚上，到处响着郝庆山的雷声
    他的爆炸技术也是很有名的。他常常以奋不顾身的精神，带领着队员，克服种种困难，胜利完成了上级给予的艰巨的爆炸任务。
    一九四五年九月间，他带着两个游击队员，奉命去炸唐河大桥。他们离桥好几里地，就把衣裳脱光下了水，把一百七十斤重的炸药箱放在菠萝里，菠萝又绑在梯子上，浮在水面上推着走。水冷得透骨，冻得浑身打哆嗦，他们在水里走走藏藏，慢慢接近了大桥；桥上鬼子哨兵走道的皮鞋声听得很真，拉响炸药后，桥塌下来了，水面上枪又打的很紧，他们都钻进冷水里，出来时一口气往回跑，身子都冻得麻木了。他这次回去害了二十多天疟子，得了喘病。
    爆破铁路更是他们的家常便饭，他们曾和部队上的工兵排挑战：不仅保证每天晚上响雷三声，炸毁铁路三个地方；还保证地雷在白天响。他们在白天化装成割草的，地雷放在草筐里，到没有敌人岗哨的地方去爆破。
    日本投降后，为了阻止蒋匪军北上制造内战，他们领受了炸火车头的任务。那时，他担任了民兵连长，曾三番两次地炸毁了敌人的火车头。好多次都是他亲自侦察和抱雷；一个晚上，他抱雷去炸票房前面的火车头，被敌人哨兵发觉，他机警地回答敌人说：“我是车上的，到那边买鸡。”（车站那边有些作小买卖的）就混了过去；等到后来雷没拉响，拉火绳被队员拉断了，他毫不犹疑地二次摸到车站里，钻到火车头底下，接好了拉火绳。
  漂亮的村落战
    他的村落战尤其打得漂亮！一九四六年六月，定县蒋匪用了一个营的兵力包围了他们村，他带领民兵据守高房和敌人开了火；高房工事被摧毁，又转入地道里继续作战；地道各暗室洞口又都被敌人点着了火，他们乘着敌人到街上放火、抢东西的当儿，两次突出烟火浓烈的地道口，用枪打死了两个敌人，并虚张声势地嚷：“一排向东冲！二排向西冲！歼灭敌人，三排向街里冲！不准打枪，捉活的！”他一面嚷，一面和三个队员，集中大枪，手榴弹向敌人打；就这样，连打带吓，把敌人闹得摸不清我们究竟有多少，乱糟糟地往回撤走了。这次毙俘敌人二十多个，我们无一伤亡。
    村里高房工事被敌人摧毁后，他又画了个图样，领导着全区的群众，在村当中修了一座土炮台：高两丈五，厚五尺，分三层，共使用了十八个村的七万多块土坯。他的火力部署很周密：炮台周围埋了七十多个拉弦地雷，拉火绳都在炮台里，按雷的远近编了号码；楼顶上存有向下放弦地雷（用手拉弦向下扔的一种雷）三十多个，手榴弹八十多个。一九四六年八月十五，定县城里蒋匪团长丁瑞达，带领着全团人马来拿这个炮台，并说：“拿不下郝白土村炮台，捉不住郝小锁（郝庆山同志的小名），决不回城！”敌人集中了六挺轻机枪，一挺重机枪，两门迫击炮，一齐向炮台猛烈射击；他们只七个人（其中还有两个看守炮台被围在里面的老乡），五支枪，炮台里被打得烟尘腾腾，呛的人出不来气，背上土落了老厚，但他们始终沉着应战；枪打、手榴弹炸、地雷轰，打垮了敌人十多次冲锋，毙伤敌人五十八名，他们仅牺牲了一个队员，创造了一比五十八的光辉战例。
    在整个对敌斗争的过程里，算起总账来，他和他的游击小组，主要成绩是：毙伤日本鬼子和蒋匪军六十多名，活捉汉奸特务四十五名，杀死汉奸十三名，炸火车头八个（他亲自炸的三个，领导民兵炸的五个），炸桥二十多次（每次都成功了），缴长短枪二十六支（其中他自己亲自缴的十三支），缴电话机八个，炸铁路五十多次。……
  “让美国鬼子知道俺们的厉害！”
    他在组织群众生产和武装保卫生产上，也都有着出色的成绩：一九四五年二月，经过他反复耐心的宣传解释，全村成立起十四个拨工组，全村一百一十五户，除两户外，全部参加。他还领着群众，在村北挖了二里地长的小河沟，能灌溉四顷多的田地，使每亩地的产量增加了三斗。他和区干部领导着压了三道防风林，使村北常受风灾的十多顷地，变成了良田。村里每次收割庄稼，他还领着民兵，进行武装保护，作到快收、快打、快藏；一次，伪县长带了三百个敌伪到他村里来抢粮，他机动灵活地转移了好几个枪眼进行射击，打死敌人两个；敌人以为是中了他的埋伏，仓惶撤走，没抢走一粒粮食。
    他现在是中共村支部书记。这次被推选来北京出席全国英模代表会议，他非常兴奋！他感动地说：“这真是我这个贫农做梦也想不到的事！”他十分愤慨美帝国主义对朝鲜、对台湾的侵略，他说：“美帝国主义要是敢来欺负俺们的中国，我一定要领导着民兵跟他干，听从上级指挥，把办法全拿出来，让美国鬼子知道俺们的厉害！”
