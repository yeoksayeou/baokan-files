　　Director of the Beijing Farmers' Association, Chai Zemin, Issues Statement:
    Firmly Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's Protest
    Farmers in Balizhuang, Beijing Suburbs, Condemn American Imperialist Aggression
    [Report from this newspaper] Regarding the incident of American airplanes intruding into our country's airspace and killing and wounding our compatriots, Chai Zemin, Director of the Beijing Farmers' Association, issued a statement on August 31st, saying: "The American planes that invaded Korea intruded into our country's airspace multiple times on August 27th and 29th, killing and wounding our compatriots. This incident once again proves that the American imperialists' dispatch of troops to Korea, invasion of Taiwan, and other criminal acts are not accidental at all, but are being carried out according to a certain plan. The Chinese people, who have long suffered from imperialist oppression and humiliation, have long recognized the ugly face of the American barbarians. No matter how sweet their tune, no matter how much they quibble, we have already expressed our attitude. The 330,000 farmers in the Beijing suburbs signed the peace declaration, which proves that the Chinese farmers hate wars of aggression and love peace. This time, the American barbarians' atrocities have aroused the righteous indignation of the broad masses of farmers. We will never tolerate the continued occurrence of these atrocities. We are very clear and confident that the American robbers' atrocities have not only been severely hit by the Korean people, but will also be driven into the sea by the Korean people; similarly, in our country's sacred territory, territorial waters, and airspace, they will inevitably be strongly struck by the Chinese people. Therefore, in addition to firmly supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's protest to Acheson and his accusation to the Security Council, we will also take practical actions to smash any provocations by the American robbers, defend our country's territory, and strive for world peace!"
    [Report from this newspaper] More than seventy farmers and others from Balizhuang, Beijing suburbs, gathered and discussed the incident of American planes invading our airspace during their evening rest. Zhang Wenhui, who led the Balizhuang farmers to form an engineering team to build the Beijing-Tianjin cement road, said: "The current China is not Chiang Kai-shek's China. At that time, American soldiers drove cars around Beijing at will, raping Chinese female students and beating Chinese people. Now China belongs to our workers and peasants, and they are not allowed to invade us casually!" Deputy Village Chief Zhang Guiyou said: "We have already overthrown the feudal landlords during the land reform. Since American imperialism still wants to invade us, we will also overthrow it." Poor peasant Gao Shan said: "American soldiers love money and are afraid of death, and they cannot win a war at all. They failed in Korea, and they dare to invade our China!" Li Wengui, Director of the Farmers' Association, and Liu Zhenqing, the Village Chief, both spoke. Village Chief Liu Zhenqing emphasized: "Our farmers must now step up production, grow more grain, and support the war to liberate Taiwan."
    The farmers unanimously stated: Now the Chinese people are the masters, and no imperialist is allowed to invade China's airspace!

　　京农会主任柴泽民发表谈话
    坚决拥护周外长抗议   
    京郊八里庄农民痛恨美帝侵略
    【本报讯】北京农会主任柴泽民为美机侵入我国领空，并杀伤我同胞事件，于八月三十一日发表谈话称：“侵略朝鲜的美国飞机先后于八月二十七、二十九两日多次侵入我国领空，并杀伤我同胞。这一事件又一次证明了美帝国主义的出兵朝鲜，侵略台湾等罪恶行为完全不是偶然的，而是依照着一定的计划执行的。饱经帝国主义压迫和凌辱的中国人民早已认识了美国生番的丑恶面貌，不管他腔调唱得怎样好听，不管他尚在怎样的狡辩，我们已表示了自己的态度，京郊三十三万农民在和平宣言上签了名，就证明了中国农民是痛恨侵略战争，热爱和平的。此次美国生番的暴行，激起了广大农民的义愤，我们决不能容忍这一暴行的继续发生。我们已非常清楚的而且有信心的认为：美国强盗的暴行，不仅已遭到朝鲜人民的严重打击，而且会被朝鲜人民一直赶下海去；同样，在我国神圣的领土、领海、领空上，也必然遭到中国人民的有力打击。因此，我们除坚决拥护周外长对艾奇逊的抗议和向安理会的控诉外，并将以实际行动粉碎美国强盗的任何挑衅，保卫我国领土，争取世界和平！”
    【本报讯】京郊八里庄农民等七十余人于黄昏休息的时候，集会座谈美机侵我领空事件。领导八里庄农民组成工程队修筑京津洋灰路的张文惠说：“现在的中国不是蒋介石的中国。那时美国兵随便开汽车在北京四处横行，强奸中国女学生，殴打中国人民，现在中国是咱们工人农民的了，不准它随便来侵略！”副村长张桂友说：“我们在土改时已把封建地主打倒了，美帝国主义既然还要侵略我们，我们同样要打倒它。”贫农高山说：“美国兵爱钱怕死，根本打不了胜仗，在朝鲜失败了，竟敢来侵扰咱中国！”农会主任李文贵和村长刘振清都发了言。村长刘振清着重地说：“我们农民现在只有加紧生产，多打粮食，支援解放台湾战争。”
    农民们一致表示：现在是中国人民作主人了，中国人民的领空不许任何帝国主义者侵犯！
