Xinhua News Agency, September 18th: On September 19th, the anniversary of the uprising of the former Kuomintang troops in Suiyuan, Nie Rongzhen, Bo Yibo, and Fu Zuoyi sent a telegram to the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee to express their congratulations. The original telegram is as follows: "In the past year, the Suiyuan uprising troops have gradually improved their level of political awareness due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's policy of unity and progress, the correct leadership of the Party, government, and army, and the hard work and study of all commanders and fighters. This has improved the various relationships between the army and the local areas, between officers and soldiers, and between political and military work, and has achieved results in major tasks such as reorganizing troops, participating in production, and eliminating bandits and special agents. On the occasion of the anniversary of the Suiyuan troops' uprising, we extend our warm congratulations to all the officers and soldiers of the uprising. We hope that they will continue to work harder to strengthen all aspects of the revolutionary troops' construction and continue to strive to build a strong national defense force based on the principles of army building as instructed by Chairman Mao."
