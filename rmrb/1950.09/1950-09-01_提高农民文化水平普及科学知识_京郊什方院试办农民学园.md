    Shifangyuan in the Suburbs of Beijing Tries Out Farmers' School
    [Our Newspaper] The Farmers' School (long-term) which is being piloted in Shifangyuan, a suburb of Beijing, with the assistance of the Rural Work Committee of Beijing Agricultural University and the local government, was officially established on August 7. The purpose of establishing this school is to improve the cultural level of farmers and popularize scientific knowledge, so as to improve agricultural production. Pest control, seed selection, and autumn plowing will be used as learning centers, and labor heroes and technical experts will be trained from practical production work to promote agricultural production work. The school has a civil school and a reading room, and holds agricultural technology and current affairs seminars. In addition, there are three groups: animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, propaganda and education, and agricultural technology. At present, the Rural Work Committee of Agricultural University is vigorously promoting autumn field seed selection through the school's publicity.
