People's Beloved Militia Hero Li Dianbing
    People sing his heroic deeds in songs and act them out in plays;
    Li Dianbing's name is spread everywhere among the people.
    Li Dianbing is from Jianjiao Village, Quyang County, Hebei Province. He is thirty-seven years old today. Before the War of Resistance, his family was very poor. Because they couldn't repay their debts, their donkey was taken away, and the whole family filled their stomachs with tree leaves all year round. Li Dianbing became a miner in Mentougou and tasted the bitterness of the old society. Therefore, in 1938, he joined the Communist Party and organized the militia in the village, standing on the front line of armed struggle to defend the people.
    In the autumn of 1941, more than 1,200 enemies came to Zhongzuo and Koutou villages. After Li Dianbing and a comrade covered the masses' evacuation, they transferred to Shimenshang Village and planned to ambush the enemy with three other comrades. While others provided cover, Li Dianbing climbed to the top of the mountain. The enemy was gathering in the river滩 at the foot of the mountain. He fired several shots in a row, killing and wounding five enemies. The enemy was momentarily routed, thinking they were surrounded by our main force, and climbed the mountains, bombarding in all directions. But Li Dianbing and his comrades had already transferred without anyone noticing.
    On September 16, 1943, the enemy gathered more than 40,000 troops and began a "mopping-up" operation in the Beiyue area, covering 100,000 square kilometers, attempting to destroy this anti-Japanese base area that threatened their heart. Li Dianbing's hometown was on the eastern front of the Beiyue area, the outpost for fighting the enemy.
    On September 29th, the enemy advanced from Fanjiachuang in two routes towards Koutou and Xiagaoer. Li Dianbing, seeing that the masses had all retreated into the mountains, buried landmines in the river滩 and climbed up the western mountain of the village with Dong Si'er and Dong Changqing, preparing to use landmines and guns to kill and injure the enemy. However, the enemy, having suffered from landmines, did not walk through the river滩 but went along the hillside towards Siergou. Li Dianbing and his comrades did not let the enemy go. Relying on their familiarity with the terrain, they took a shortcut and rushed to the eastern ridge of Siergou. They saw the enemy, a yellow and mixed line of them, heading towards Zhongzuo on the narrow road of the opposite ridge, two hundred meters away. What a great opportunity! They fired a volley of shots, and five devils fell. The muddle-headed enemy didn't know where the gunshots came from, dropped two donkeys and several bags of millet, and hid in the dark ditch in panic, not daring to move. At this time, Li Dianbing left Dong Changqing to return to the village to guard the landmines and take care of the village work, and followed the enemy with Dong Si'er,绕 to the mountain on the flank of the enemy in the dark ditch. The enemy had already set off for Zhongzuo, leaving only thirty or so guards. Li Dianbing approached the enemy and used his good marksmanship, honed from hunting since childhood and in guerrilla warfare, to shoot and kill a devil with one shot. The devils all cried "Jiji mama," as if calling the enemies in front to come back, and used wires to tie up a stretcher to carry the dead. At this time, Li Dianbing fired another shot, wounding a devil. The enemy was in chaos, abandoning the dead and a large gun and fleeing in embarrassment. Taking advantage of the enemy's chaos, Li Dianbing and Dong Si'er killed and wounded eleven more enemies.
    That night, the enemy converged and were stationed in Koutou, Dongshimen, Shimenshang, Zhongzuo and other villages. The escaped villagers were trapped in the mountain沟. Li Dianbing led the militia, disregarding the fatigue of several days of fighting, and set off again to cover the masses of Zhuazigou moving to Luojiagou, jumping out of the enemy's encirclement. The food that the masses brought was all eaten up, the adults ate raw dates to fill their hunger, the children couldn't just eat dates, so Li Dianbing distributed the captured grain to everyone. The old men said: "With our Dianbing, we can save our lives and not go hungry!"
    The cruel struggle continued, and the enemy began to "mop up" in the驻地. Comrade Li Dianbing assisted the government in mobilizing the masses to strengthen the walls and clear the fields, preparing for a long-term counter-mopping-up operation. In the evening, he convened meetings with the masses to talk about how to unite against the enemy, adhere to anti-Japanese secrets, and educated the masses with the example of the shameless Jiao Fuyin and Li Sangeng of Zhongzuo Village informing the enemy, resulting in their deaths by the enemy, strengthening the masses' will to fight.
    One day at dawn, the enemy surrounded the mountain for searching. They searched all the big and small mountains, and finally found sixteen women and children, including Li Dianbing's wife and two children, because he was busy fighting guerrillas and didn't have time to send them away.
    The enemy tortured them in every possible way, stripping them naked, ridiculing them, and driving them back to Jianjiao naked. The enemy interrogated them about the whereabouts of the militia, village cadres, and Eighth Route Army, and where the landmines and grain were buried. People only answered: "Don't know". The enemy was furious, using steel needles to nail people's faces, and stabbing and戳ing people with刺刀 and枪把, forcing them to walk barefoot in the谷槎子地. But no one shed tears or gave in. They endured shame and pain, remembering Li Dianbing's words: "Surrendering to the enemy is shameless, we must keep anti-Japanese secrets." The enemy could not get a confession, so they set fire to the houses to threaten them. The houses were on fire, and the flames soared into the sky. The guerrilla group on the mountain opened fire on the area, and the enemy panicked for a while, and the women and children were able to hide away. In the evening, Li Dianbing sent someone to pick them up, and the guerrillas took off their clothes and distributed them to them. Li Dianbing's wife saw her man and tearfully cried about her experience. Dianbing felt like a fire was burning in his heart, remembering every blood debt the devils owed him: the house was burned, his father was beaten to death, and his wife was tortured again. He gritted his teeth and said to the guerrilla group members: "If we don't fight the enemy, do we have the face to live?!"
    From then on, Li Dianbing's guerrilla group became more active. They buried landmines in the village, and the enemy triggered three, blowing blood all over the ground. They trailed the enemy retreating towards Fanjiachuang, climbed to the top of the mountain, and shot the devil translator in the head with one shot. His comrade Dong Changqing also fired a shot, killing a puppet soldier. The enemy was in chaos, and everyone fired together, and three more enemies fell. The enemy rushed up, and they hid; the enemy retreated dejectedly, and Li Dianbing came out to clean the battlefield. Dozens of bullets, four donkeys, a telephone...became their spoils of war.
    The enemy did not retreat, but was repeatedly "mopping up". At this time, the autumn crops were ripe, and Li Dianbing led his guerrilla group to practice martial arts in their spare time, setting up "mountain top posts" during the day and putting up "village connected哨" at night, monitoring the enemy and protecting the masses'抢收, burying the harvested grain, and always preparing for battle. One night, Li Dianbing was侦察 the enemy's situation on the way to Wujiawan when he was suddenly hugged by the enemy's尖兵. He used all his strength to throw off the enemy and turned around to run back. When he got to the village, he sent his wife and children away himself, but he carried a sick comrade named Liu Zhihe up the mountain and hid in a hole that had been dug long ago. The enemy entered the village, and the village was empty; they went up the mountain, and the mountain was also empty. The sick man lay safely in the hole, and Li Dianbing led the militia again to attack the enemy's back or side.
    After three months of hard work by the military and civilians in the border area, the counter-"mopping up" operation of 1943 ended victoriously on December 15. The name of hero Li Dianbing spread everywhere among the people. In the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, no one didn't know Li Dianbing. People composed songs about his heroic deeds and performed them in dramas. In 1944, he attended the Border Region Hero Congress and was elected as a combat hero. Since then, he has become a shining banner for the militia in the border region.

　　人民热爱的民兵英雄李殿冰
    人们把他的英雄事迹编成歌来唱，编成戏来演；
    李殿冰的名字，在人民中间到处流传。
    李殿冰是河北省曲阳县尖地角村人，今天三十七岁，抗战前家里很穷，因欠债还不起，毛驴被人家拉走了，全家终年用树叶填肚子。李殿冰就在门头沟当了矿工，饱尝了旧社会的辛酸。所以，一九三八年他就加入了共产党，并在村里组织民兵，为保卫人民，站在武装斗争的最前线。
    一九四一年秋，敌人一千二百多，朝中佐、口头村来了。李殿冰和他一个同伴，掩护群众撤走以后，就转到石门上村，同三个同志计划伏击敌人。别人作掩护，李殿冰爬上山头。山脚下河滩里敌人正在集合。他连发几枪，打死打伤敌人五名，敌人一时溃乱，以为被我主力包围了，纷纷爬上大山，向四面轰击，但是李殿冰他们却早神不知鬼不觉地转移了。
    一九四三年九月十六日，敌人集结四万多人在北岳区十万平方华里的地区开始了扫荡，陆空军配合，妄想摧毁这块威胁着他们心脏的抗日根据地。李殿冰的家乡，在北岳区的东线，这是与敌搏斗的前哨阵地。
    九月二十九日，敌人从范家庄分两路向口头、下高儿前进。李殿冰看着群众都撤进了山，就把地雷埋在河滩里，同董四儿、董长庆爬上了村西山头，准备用地雷大枪杀伤敌人。但是吃过地雷苦头的敌人，不走河滩，沿着山坡向寺儿沟去了。李殿冰他们并不放过敌人，凭着地理熟悉，走近路赶到寺儿沟的东岭，眼看着敌人在二百米远对面岭的窄路上，黄杂杂的一溜正向中佐走。这是多么好的机会呀！他们连打一阵排子枪，五个鬼子倒下了，昏头昏脑的敌人，还不知那来的枪声，丢了两头驴和几袋小米，仓惶地躲在黑沟里不敢动。这时李殿冰留下董长庆回村看守地雷和照顾村里工作，又同董四儿跟着敌人，绕到黑沟敌人侧翼的山上。敌人已向中佐出发，只剩下三十多个后卫。李殿冰逼近敌人，用他从小打猎和在游击战中练的好枪法，一枪打死一个鬼子，鬼子们都“唧唧吗吗”地叫着，像是喊前面的敌人回来，并用电线扎了一付担架抬起死人。这时李殿冰又响一枪，打伤一个鬼子。敌人乱了，丢掉死尸和一支大枪狼狈奔逃。乘敌纷乱之际，李殿冰和董四儿，又打死打伤敌人十一名。
    当晚，敌人会合，分驻在口头、东石门、石门上、中佐等村。逃出的老乡被困在山沟里。李殿冰带领民兵，不顾几天来战斗的疲劳，又出发掩护抓子沟的群众移到罗家沟，跳出敌人的合击圈。群众带的粮食都吃光了，大人们拿生枣充饥，孩子们光吃枣儿不行，李殿冰就把缴获的粮食，分给大家用。老头们说：“有咱殿冰，命能保，肚子也饿不着！”
    残酷的斗争在继续着，敌人开始在驻地“清剿”。李殿冰同志协助政府发动群众坚壁清野，作长期反扫荡的准备。晚上就召集群众开会，讲如何团结对敌，坚守抗日秘密，并以中佐村焦福印、李三更等无耻向敌告密，结果亦被敌杀死的实例教育群众，坚定了群众的斗争意志。
    一天拂晓，敌人围山搜索。大山小岭都串遍了，最后搜出十六个妇女和小孩，李殿冰的妻子和两个小孩也在里面，因为他忙着打游击，没有顾得上送她们走。
    敌人百般的折磨她们，剥光了衣服，嬉笑她们，把她们赤着身子赶回尖地角。敌人向他们拷问着民兵、村干、八路军的去向，地雷、粮食埋在那里，人们只是答：“不知道”。敌人愤怒了，用钢针钉在人们的脸上，刺刀、枪把朝人们乱打乱戳，逼着他们光着脚在谷槎子地里走。但是没有一个人流泪、屈服。她们含羞、忍痛，记着李殿冰的话：“向敌人屈服是无耻的，要保守抗日秘密。”敌人得不出口供，就放火烧房来威胁她们。房子着了，火光冲天，山头上游击组开枪向这里射击，敌人一时慌乱，妇女孩子们才躲藏开了。晚上，李殿冰派人把她们接出来，游击队员们脱下自己的衣裳，分给她们穿。李殿冰的妻子见了自己的男人，眼泪汪汪地哭诉着自己的遭遇。殿冰心里像烧起一团火，想起了鬼子欠他的每一笔血债：屋子被烧、父亲被打死、妻子又被折磨，他咬着牙对游击组员们说：“不给敌人拼还有脸活吗？！”
    从此，李殿冰的游击组更活跃了。他们在村里埋上地雷，敌人触响三个，炸的满地鲜血。他们尾追向范家庄撤退的敌人，登上山头，一枪击中了鬼子翻译官的脑袋，同伴董长庆也发一枪，打死一个伪军。敌人一乱，大家一齐射击，又有三个敌人倒下了。敌人冲上来，他们藏了；敌人丧气地退下去，李殿冰却出来打扫战场。几十发子弹、四头驴、一部电话机……成了他们的战利品。
    敌人并没有退走，而是在反复扫荡。这时秋庄稼早熟了，李殿冰率领他的游击组，抽空习练武艺，白天设下“山头岗”，晚上放上“连村哨”，一面监视敌人，一面保卫群众抢收，打下的粮食埋起来，时刻准备着战斗。一天夜里，李殿冰去吴家湾路上侦察敌情，忽然被敌人尖兵抱住了，他用全身的力量甩开敌人，扭头回跑。到了村里，打发老婆孩子自己走，他却背着一个叫刘志合的病号同志，上了山，藏在一个早挖好的洞里。敌人进了村，村子空空的，上了山，山也空空的。病号安全地躺在洞里，李殿冰又带着民兵，转到敌人背后或侧面去打击敌人了。
    经过三个月的边区军民奋战，到十二月十五日，一九四三年反扫荡胜利结束了。英雄李殿冰的名字在人民中间到处流传。在原晋察冀边区，没有谁不知道李殿冰的。人们把他的英雄事迹编成歌来唱，编成戏来演。一九四四年他出席边区群英大会，当选为战斗英雄。从此，他就成了边区民兵的一面光辉的旗帜。
