Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 9th: The former Egyptian Embassy in Nanjing was attacked by thugs on September 3rd, and the former Egyptian Chargé d'affaires, Boutros Abadir, was stabbed and seriously injured. The Nanjing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau is currently closely investigating the case. The details are as follows:

On the evening of September 3rd, at 11:00 PM, three thugs scaled the wall and entered the residence of Boutros Abadir, the Chargé d'affaires of the former Egyptian Embassy, located at 59 North Pingjiang Road, Nanjing. The three thugs first tied up the gatekeeper, Mr. Huang, and then went to the bedroom of Chen Yuzhong, the administrator of the former Egyptian Embassy, ordering Chen not to make any noise. They claimed that they had come from Taiwan and intended to borrow travel expenses from foreigners to return to Taiwan. The thugs asked Chen: How much in US dollars is there in Abadir's safe? Chen replied that he did not know. The thugs then ordered Chen to get the key and pretend that there was an urgent telegram from Egypt in order to lure Abadir downstairs. Chen refused. The thugs then tied up Chen again and found the key to the upstairs and Chen's salary of 200,000 yuan under Chen's pillow. The thugs then forcibly dragged Chen and Huang upstairs. First they went to the room of the Chinese maid, Ama, and tied Ama up. All three were detained in Ama's bedroom, guarded by a thug holding a sharp knife. The other two thugs went straight to Abadir's bedroom. Abadir was awakened by the noise and saw one of the thugs had already arrived in front of his bedroom door, and immediately shouted for help. The thug was also startled by the sound and ran away. Abadir then chased the thug downstairs. The thug guarding the servants also chased after them, and the three of them fought with Abadir downstairs. As a result, Abadir was stabbed four times and his head was also struck, resulting in considerable bleeding. However, Abadir still managed to run to the street and shout for the police. But the patrol had already passed at this time, and no one was found. At this point, the thugs escaped from the back wall.

Abadir's wife, who was living in another room, was awakened by the sound and, seeing the situation, tried to call the security authorities, but found that the telephone line had been cut by the thugs. She then ordered Chen Wanzhong and others to go to other places to call the security brigade. After receiving the news, the brigade immediately sent people to inspect the scene, and staff from the Foreign Affairs Management Section also rushed to the scene. Seeing that Abadir's injuries were very serious, they called Dr. C.S. Trimmer of Gulou Hospital to come for a diagnosis and sent Abadir to Gulou Hospital for emergency treatment at around 4:00 AM.

After Abadir received a blood transfusion and glucose injections on the 4th, his condition improved, but he is still not out of danger.

In addition, after a detailed inspection of the scene, the security brigade found that the thugs had entered through the back wall and escaped from the same point. The thugs left behind an old-fashioned pistol and two masks inside the wall. The Nanjing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau is continuing its investigation into this case.

　　南京前埃及使馆被暴徒袭击
    市公安局现正严密侦察案情
    【新华社南京九日电】南京前埃及驻华大使馆在九月三日被暴徒袭击，前埃及代办阿巴提被刺受重伤。南京市人民政府公安局现正严密侦查案情。此事经过如下：
    九月三日晚十一时，有暴徒三人，越墙进入南京市北平路五十九号前埃及使馆代办阿巴提（ＢoutrosAbadir）住宅。三暴徒首先将看门人黄某捆绑，再至前埃及使馆管事陈禹钟卧室，令陈不得声张，并声称彼等自台湾来，拟向外侨借路费返台。暴徒问陈：阿巴提保险箱内有美钞若干？陈答称不知。暴徒即令陈取钥匙，并令陈伪称有埃及来急电，以便诱阿巴提下楼，陈拒绝。暴徒即又将陈捆绑，并自陈枕下寻得通楼上钥匙及陈之薪金二十万元。暴徒随即强拉陈，黄至楼上。先到中国籍女佣阿妈房间，将阿妈加以捆绑。三人同被拘在阿妈卧房，为一手持尖刀之暴徒看管。另外两个暴徒即直冲阿巴提卧室。阿巴提闻声惊起，见暴徒一人已来到他的卧室门前，当即惊呼。暴徒闻声亦惊走。阿巴提随即尾追暴徒到楼下。看管仆人之暴徒也追踪而至，三人即与阿巴提在楼下对殴。结果阿被刺四刀，头部也被击破，流血颇多。但阿巴提仍撑持奔至街上呼喊警察。但此时巡逻已过，未找到人。至此暴徒乃从后墙逸去。
    居住另室之阿巴提夫人此时已闻声惊起，见状后，即拟打电话通知治安当局，但发现电话线已被暴徒割断，遂令陈万钟等至其他地点打电话报告治安大队。该队闻讯后，当即派人前往视察，外侨管理科工作人员亦闻讯赶至。因见阿巴提伤势甚重，即打电话请鼓楼医院屈穆尔（Ｃ．Ｓ．Ｔrimmer）医生前来诊断，并于上午四点左右将阿巴提送往鼓楼医院急救。
    阿巴提经于四日输血并注射葡萄糖以后，情况已见好转，但目前尚未脱离危险期。
    又：治安大队在出事地点作详细检察后，发现暴徒系由后墙越入，并自同一点奔逸。暴徒在墙内遗下旧式手枪一枝，口罩两个。对于这个案件，南京市人民政府公安局现正继续侦查。
