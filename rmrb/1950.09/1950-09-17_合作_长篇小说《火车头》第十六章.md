　　Cooperation
    ——Chapter 16 of the novel "Locomotive"
    Cao Ming
    (Continued from issue 65 of "People's Literature" on September 10th)
    One day, when the riveters' branch was reading the newspaper, they came across an article about the Majiawan Railway Factory exceeding its production target and successfully completing the "February 7th" project, and there was also a feature article on Li Xuewen. When Li Xuewen heard that it was about him, he felt flustered and couldn't hear clearly. Later, he took the newspaper himself and secretly avoided everyone to read it carefully. After reading it for a long time, he finished it, and smiled to himself, thinking: That kid, he's praising me to the skies! - This is not good, if they write about me so well, and people take a look at me - it's two different things, they will definitely scold me: "Humph, so this is what he is!" When he saw that the reporter Cai Huaiqing wrote about how handsome he was, he bit his lip shyly, and suddenly thought of Jin Xiufeng, and felt depressed.
    "She's sleeping on the young master's arm, she's forgotten me!"
    When he imagined her in another man's arms, anger burned in him, he felt hot and uncomfortable in his chest, his eyes narrowed into triangles, and his teeth ground angrily.
    "Master Li, I've been looking for you everywhere. I couldn't find you there." Fan Yuting, the near-sighted and taciturn director of the laboratory, walked towards him and sat with him on top of a horizontally placed gasoline drum. Li Xuewen raised his body involuntarily, and Fan Yuting immediately pressed him down, continuing to say: "Tomorrow is Sunday, I don't know if you have time?"
    "What's the matter?" Li Xuewen asked calmly, abandoning Jin Xiufeng from his mind.
    "If you have nothing to do tomorrow, I will come back to the factory with you and do another accurate test of the welding rods. Comrade Fang has been talking to me about it for a few days, but last month there was a problem with cutting electric plates with the welding machine, and you were very busy, so I didn't look for you. Actually, there is a great shortage of welding rods, we should make them, make them in large quantities, so we can supply the entire Shenyang area, to avoid 'digging a well when thirsty'..."
    Li Xuewen immediately became happy, shook Fan Yuting's hand, and said repeatedly: "I'll come early tomorrow morning, I'll definitely come tomorrow!" But he unhappily muttered: "But that formula is with Technician Li, my..."
    "It's already been retrieved." Director Fan said calmly, prepared in advance.
    The factory was very quiet on Sunday. Sparrows perched under the eaves of the workshop and on the tree trunks, calling to each other from afar, proudly making their calls the loudest sound in the factory today. Except for a dozen or so trade union cadres who came back and had a small meeting with Fang Xiaohong, there was no other activity. Li Xuewen brought all the remaining medicinal powders from home. As soon as he entered the factory, he met his elder brother, who was about to leave to go home. Now Li Xuewen looked at his younger brother with different eyes, and the past reproaches had turned into encouragement. He saw him carrying many medicinal powders, and knew at a glance what his brother was doing. He asked him:
    "Are you testing welding rods? That's good, there's a shortage of welding rods recently, don't wait until you can't get them to test, it will delay the work. Last time there was a shortage of oxygen, it made people worry to death."
    "Are you going home?" Li Xuewen frowned. Seeing that his brother nodded, he instructed him: "Just now, Xiaozhu had a stomach ache for a long time, and would only calm down when I held him. But I made an appointment with Director Fan today, so I can't - he's asleep now, if his stomach still hurts later, ask sister-in-law to apply cupping glasses. I might not be able to go back until late at night." After he finished speaking, he turned and walked towards the laboratory. As he walked, he pondered that his elder brother and some workmates had recently often gone to Comrade Fang's place for meetings, sometimes until late at night. When asked what meetings they were having, he wouldn't say. He often picked up the "Communist Party Member Textbook" to read, as well as "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party." When his elder brother was not around, he had secretly read all the books to see if there were any secrets inside, but he couldn't figure it out. At this time, he thought self-consciously: "My elder brother must be qualified and will soon join the Communist Party! This time, I'm falling behind!" Then he thought again: "My contribution to the people is too - none, I haven't made any contribution to the factory. How can people want me? But I must be firm, if not this year, then next year, I will work hard." He remembered the words in the Communist Party Member Textbook, and hope was rekindled.
    Director Fan had already arrived. Seeing Li Xuewen, he nodded happily. Li Xuewen opened the packets of medicinal powders one by one, and the two of them began to study them. He opened a packet of medicine, recited the name, and placed it aside: "This is black lead powder," "This is sodium bicarbonate," "This is manganese dioxide"...
    Fan Yuting lowered his head, examining each item carefully, as if sniffing them with his nose. "Hmm, this is not manganese dioxide, it's black lead powder used for sand casting." He handed the medicinal powder to him, rubbing it with his fingers, and said: "Look, manganese dioxide is a dark black powder, without any shine, and when you rub it with your hands, it's not as smooth as black lead powder. In terms of specific gravity, manganese dioxide is also heavier than black lead powder. - This is undoubtedly black lead powder."
    They continued to identify the medicinal materials. Fan Yuting recited, "This is titanium oxide, oh, sodium bicarbonate, which is our commonly used baking soda." Later, he opened another packet of black stuff and said happily: "This might be manganese dioxide, how come, it looks like it and doesn't look like it, strange!"
    "What should we do? Is it or isn't it? I remember buying manganese dioxide once, and it was very expensive."
    "Let me test it." Fan Yuting, with calm and practiced movements, mixed per硫酸亞 and silver nitrate solution, and put in the black lead powder. Soon, the solution turned a bright peach red. "It's manganese. But it's not very pure, it seems..."
    "My youngest son played a trick, he played with the medicinal powders when I wasn't at home." Li Xuewen happily put the manganese dioxide aside.
    The medicines were all checked, and according to the formula, silica sand and iron oxide were missing. There were also no these two things in the laboratory, and Li Xuewen was worried again. It was Sunday, and no one was at the warehouse, and he didn't have money to buy them on the street. Fan Yuting didn't say anything, and was trying to figure out a solution. Li Xuewen stared at him with wide eyes, expectantly.
    "Make a phone call to Comrade Fang, ask her if she has a solution." Li Xuewen suggested.
    Fan Yuting gently shook his head, still not saying a word. Li Xuewen anxiously stared at him, sitting quietly beside him.
    "How about this, iron oxide is easy to handle, let's use rust to replace it. But silica sand - I know Tangshan produces it."
    "Dalian also has it," Li Xuewen added.
    "Its main component is silicon dioxide, and also a small amount of aluminum oxide, calcium, sodium, etc. It is a raw material for making glass. Think about whether we can replace it with glass."
    "Should we try it?" Li Xuewen was happy, and immediately straightened his tall body, "I'll go find glass."
    "Then, I'll go find rust. You smash the glass into small pieces, smash it into powder."
    By noon, both glass and rust had been found. The two of them heated up the food they had brought and ate it. Chewing on the corn bread, Li Xuewen thought of his son, and exclaimed: "I don't know if my son's stomach still hurts."
    "Who's taking care of him?"
    "My sister-in-law."
    "What about your wife?"
    "She died early!"
    "Ah, life must be hard?"
    "It is, I still have a young one at home! My sister-in-law has many children. How many children do you have?"
    "Three. My wife is useless. She can't even take care of three children, and I still have to help her cook every morning and evening." Fan Yuting swallowed a bite of salted fish, and conveniently let Li Xuewen eat some salted fish, and continued: "The female comrades of the Communist Party are all capable, working like men. Not to mention Comrade Fang, even Director Liu's wife has three children, and isn't she working in the personnel department now? The Communist Party really has many good things; from liberation until now, I haven't seen anything wrong with them. It's true that their people are laymen when it comes to industry, Director Liu and Comrade Fang are the same. I think, being a layman isn't a crime, it can only be considered a flaw. What do you say, Master Li?"
    Li Xuewen kept nodding and said: "It doesn't matter if they're laymen, they can't see the problems, but we can see them; it's just that our words aren't effective, it's useless to bring them up. Watching many things in the workshop that need to be changed, but the higher-ups rarely adopt them." He lamented, while very surprised at Director Fan's attitude. In his mind, he thought that the staff above all looked down on the workers and didn't approve of the Communist Party. But now, the laboratory director in front of him clearly treated him like a friend, and also highly praised the Communist Party. He couldn't help but think of Technician Dong and Chen Qi, who often went to the workshop, and said in his heart: "These are all good people! There are still not many like Shan Daomu and Li Muxi. Comrade Fang has a high vision, she said long ago that the staff are also the working class, also our brothers; moreover, they are all learned..."
    The two of them chatted very congenially. Although Fan Yuting's speech was a bit stilted, Li Xuewen found it difficult to understand; but he thought he was honest and lovable, and he especially admired his scientific knowledge. He suddenly regretted thinking: "If I had known he was such an amiable person, I should have come to him earlier, wouldn't the welding rods have been made long ago?"
    It wasn't until nightfall that they welded the newly made welding rods and took them to the anti-tear tester for testing. The results of the test showed that the highest record was 33 kg/mm, and the lowest was 24 kg/mm.
    Fan Yuting shook his head thoughtfully and said, "But the tensile strength of the boiler plate needs 35 kg/mm, this is still not good enough."
    Li Xuewen hung his head dejectedly.
    Fan Yuting softly comforted him, and explained to him: "Silica sand stabilizes the arc and increases electrical conductivity; manganese dioxide in the coating also stabilizes the arc, and its oxidizing property can also increase the peeling off of slag. I think, Master Li, this time the test results are not good because the amount of manganese dioxide is not suitable, shall we try again tomorrow?"
    Li Xuewen agreed, he took out the medicine and brought the scale. After Fan Yuting locked the laboratory door and went home, he returned to the workshop, studied it again in detail through the night, recalling Director Fan's words, readjusted the amount of medicine, and made the welding rods.
    The next day, he took the welded iron plate to ask Fan Yuting to test it. Fan Yuting asked about the details and knew that he had stayed up all night alone, and sincerely admired him, saying: "Only you deserve to be the true master of the country - I am ashamed to be inferior! - How is your child's illness?"
    "This morning I asked my elder brother, he said he slept very well all night. Stomach ache is nothing for children." Li Xuewen smiled and looked at the iron plate.
    Fan Yuting didn't say anything, and quickly took the iron plate to test it. This time, the highest record reached 40 kg/mm. He was very happy, but at the same time worriedly said to Li Xuewen: "Did you remember the amount?"
    "I remembered it." Li Xuewen nodded, spread out a wrinkled piece of paper, and pointed with his thick fingers, saying: "What you said is very right, I reduced the amount of manganese dioxide to 20 percent. I think this is more suitable for boiler plates."
    "I wish you success!" Fan Yuting tightly shook the riveter's hand. Through the thick glass lenses, his eyes shone with sincere, admiring light.
    "Without your guidance, it would definitely not have been successful!" Li Xuewen happily shook the other's palm.
    Both of them smiled happily.

    ——长篇小说《火车头》第十六章
    草明
    （续九月十日《人民文艺》第六十五期）
    一天，铆工分厂念报时读到一篇关于马家湾铁路工厂超过生产任务，胜利完成“二七”号的消息，并有一篇是对李学文的特写。李学文听到写的自己，不觉心慌起来，听不清；后来自己拿来报纸，悄悄避开大家来细看；看了半天，看完了，微笑地想着：那小子，把我捧上半天高啦！——不妙，把我写的这么好，人家到我跟前一瞅，——两码事，准要骂道：“哼，原来是这样一块材料！”他又看到记者蔡槐清写道他如何漂亮时，羞怯的咬了一下嘴唇，突然想起了金秀凤，心中便闷闷不乐。
    “她枕上那少东家的胳膊睡觉啦，把我忘啦！”
    他一幻想到她在别的男人的怀抱里时，怒火就燃烧着他，他觉得胸膛里热的难受，双眼压成三角形，两排牙齿恨恨的磨着。
    “李师傅，让我好找，那儿也没找到你。”近视眼，不爱说话的化验室主任范雨亭向他走了过来，和他一块坐在一只横放着的汽油桶子上面。李学文不觉抬起身来，范雨亭立刻按住了他，继续说道：“明天是星期日，不晓得你有工夫没有？”
    “有什么事吗？”李学文丢开了脑子里的金秀凤，平静地问。
    “明天如果你没有什么事，我和你一道回厂来，再准确地做一回电焊条试试看。方同志已对我说了几天，只是上个月闹电焊割电板，你挺忙，我没去找你，其实电焊条缺的很，咱们把它做出来，大量的做出来，可以供全沈阳的需要，免得‘临渴掘井’……”
    李学文立刻高兴起来，握住了范雨亭的手，连声说：“我明天清早就来，我明天一定来！”但是他又不愉快地叨念说：“可是那方子，在李技术员那里，我的……”
    “已经要回来啦。”范主任冷静地，有备无患地说。
    星期日的工厂十分清静，家雀停在现场的屋檐下，停在树干上，遥遥的彼此叫唤，在骄傲自己的叫喊成为今天厂里最响亮的声音。除了十几个工会干部回来了和方晓红开了个小会，别的什么动静也没有。李学文把家里剩下来的全部药粉都拿了来；一进厂就碰见了自己的大哥。他正要出门回去。现在李学德对弟弟已是另眼看待，过去的责备都变成了鼓励。他看见他挟着许多药面，一看就知道弟弟来干什么，问他道：
    “试验电焊条是不是？也好，最近电焊条缺的很，不要等来不了时才试验，耽误活计。上次短了氧气，叫人操心死了。”
    “你回家么？”李学文皱起了眉心，看见哥哥点了点头，他就叮嘱他：“刚才小柱肚子痛了半天，要我抱着他才肯安静点。可是我今天和范主任约好，再不能——他现在睡着了，如果一会他肚子还痛，就叫大嫂子拔拔火罐。我说不定下晚才能回去。”他说完了，转身就往化验室走去。他一路走一路寻思他大哥和一些工友最近常到方同志那里去开会，有时开到晚上，问他开什么会他不说；手中常拿起《共产党员课本》看，还有《中国革命与中国共产党》。他大哥不在时，他曾把书拿来通通看了；看看书里面有没有什么秘密，他猜不透。这时他自惭地想：“大哥想必已够格，快加入共产党了！这一回我落在后头了！”回头他又想：“我对人民的贡献太——没有，对工厂一点贡献也没有；人家怎能要我？可是我一定坚决，今年不行，明年，我好好干活。”他想起共产党员课本里面所说的话，又燃起了希望。
    范主任早已来了，看见李学文，欢洽地点了点头。李学文把药面一包一包打开，两个人开始研究起来。他打开了一包药，把药名唱一遍，放在一边：“这是黑铅粉”，“这是重炭酸漕达”，“这是二氧化锰”……
    范雨亭俯低头，一样一样过细看，好像用鼻子去嗅它们似的。“嗯，这不是二氧化锰，是翻砂用的黑铅粉。”他把药面递到他跟前，用手指搓着说：“你瞅，二氧化锰是乌黑的粉末，不带亮光，而且用手搓的时候，不像黑铅粉那样滑；从比重来说，二氧化锰也比黑铅粉重一些。——这是黑铅粉无疑。”
    他们继续辨认着药料，范雨亭唱着，“这是氧化鐟，呶，炭酸氢钠，就是我们常用的面起子。”后来又打开一包黑的东西，高兴地说：“这可能是二氧化锰，怎么，又像又不像，奇怪！”
    “这怎么办呢？到底是与不是？我记得我买过一回二氧化锰，还贵的很。”
    “待我来化验一下。”范雨亭以沉着熟练的动作调好了过硫酸亚和硝酸银溶液，把黑铅粉末放进去。不久，溶液现出鲜艳的桃红色。“是锰。只是不太纯，好像……”
    “我的小儿子捣的蛋，我不在家他就拿药面子玩。”李学文高兴地把二氧化锰放在一边。
    药看齐全了，照方子一点，就短了硅砂和氧化铁；化验室里也没有这两样东西，李学文又犯愁了。星期天，仓库又没人，上街买又没有钱。范雨亭没吱声，在哪儿想办法。李学文期待地向他瞪大了眼睛。
    “去个电话给方同志，问问她有办法没有。”李学文提议说。
    范雨亭轻轻摆摆头，仍然不啃气。李学文焦急地望住他，静悄悄坐在旁边。
    “这么的吧，氧化铁好办，咱们拿铁锈来代替。只是硅砂——我知道唐山有出产。”
    “大连也有。”李学文补充说。
    “它主要成份是二氧化矽，还有少量的氧化铝、钙、钠等；它是造玻璃的原料。你寻思寻思拿玻璃是不是能代替它。”
    “咱试试看好么？”李学文高兴了，立刻伸直了高大的身子，“我去找玻璃去。”
    “那么，我去找铁锈。你把玻璃砸的碎碎的，砸成面面。”
    到了晌午，玻璃和铁锈都找来了。两个人各自把带来的饭一热就吃了起来。李学文嚼着窝窝头便想起儿子，不觉失声道：“我的儿子不知道肚子还痛不痛。”
    “谁看他？”
    “我的嫂子。”
    “你屋里的呢？”
    “早殁啦！”
    “唉，日子难过吧？”
    “可不是，家里还有个小的！我大嫂孩子又多。你家几个孩子？”
    “三个。我屋里的没用。照顾三个孩子还照顾不过来，每天早晚还要我帮她做饭。”范雨亭咽了一口咸鱼，顺便把咸鱼让李学文吃，继续说：“人家共产党的女同志个个都能干，和男人一样干。方同志不用说了，就是刘厂长的太太带了三个孩子，现在不是在人事科工作了么？人家共产党的好处真多；从解放到现在，我还看不到他们有些什么不对的地方。他们的人对工业外行是真的，刘厂长和方同志都一个样。我想，外行不是罪过，只能算是美中不足。你说呢，李师傅？”
    李学文不住点头说：“外行也不要紧，他们瞅不出来毛病，咱们能瞅出来；只是咱们的话不好使唤，提上去也白搭。眼看着现场里有许多事情得变一变才好，可是上头轻易不采纳呀。”他一面惋惜着，一面很惊诧范主任的态度。在他思想里，以为上头的那些职员都是瞧不起工人和不赞成共产党的。可是现在在他眼前的化验室主任分明待朋友似的对待他，而且又极力推崇共产党。他不觉想起了董技术员和常下现场的陈琦，心里说：“这些都是好人！像单道木，李慕西那样的还是不多。人家方同志眼光高，她早就说人家职员也是工人阶级，也是我们的弟兄；况且人家都有学问……”
    这两个人很投机的唠起来，虽然范雨亭说话有点文绉绉，李学文听起来很费劲；可是他认为他诚实可爱，他特别佩服人家有科学知识。他忽然后悔地想：“早知他是个和气人，我早就该来找他，电焊条不是早做成了吗？”
    一直到入夜，他们才把新做成的电焊条焊上，拿到抗拆器上试验。试验的结果，最高纪录是３３Ｋ．ｇ／ｍ．ｍ，最低是２４Ｋ．ｇ／ｍ．ｍ。
    范雨亭沉思地摇摇头说，“可是锅炉板的抗张力需要３５Ｋ．ｇ／ｍ．ｍ这还不行。”
    李学文沉闷地挂下了脑袋。
    范雨亭柔声安慰他，并且对他解释说：“硅砂是安定电弧和增加电动性的；二氧化锰在被复剂里的作用也是安定电弧，氧化性还可以增加熔滓的剥落。说到氧化铁，性子和二氧化锰差不多，但是它不能增加熔滓的剥落。我寻思，李师傅，这一次的试验结果不佳，是二氧化锰分量不适合，明天咱们再来试试，好吗？”
    李学文答应了，他把药拿了出来，把秤也拿了来。等范雨亭锁好化验室的门回家之后，他却回到现场，漏夜又过细研究了一遍，回想着范主任的话，重新把药的份量调整一次，做成了焊条。
    第二天，他又把这一回焊好的铁板拿去请范雨亭试验。范雨亭一问底细，知道他昨夜独自熬了一个通宵，便衷心佩服地说：“你这才配成为真正的国家的主人——我自愧不如！——你的孩子病怎样了呢？”
    “今天早上我问了大哥，他说他一夜睡的很好。小孩们肚子痛不算什么一回事。”李学文微笑的望住铁板。
    范雨亭不说什么，赶紧拿铁板去试验。这一次最高纪录达到４０Ｋ．ｇ／ｍ．ｍ。他很高兴，但是同时操心地向李学文说：“你把份量记起来没有？”
    “记起来了。”李学文点点头，把一张起皱的纸头摊开，粗大的手指头指着说：“你的话说的很对，我把二氧化锰的份量减至百分之二十，我寻思，这样对锅炉板合适些。”
    “祝你成功！”范雨亭紧紧的握着铆工的手。透过厚厚的玻璃镜子，他的眼睛闪出诚恳的，敬佩的光芒。
    “没有你指导，绝对做不成！”李学文高兴的摇摆着对方的手掌。
    两人都愉快地笑了。
