Report on the National Financial Industry Joint Conference
    Report to the 49th Political Affairs Conference of the Government Administration Council on September 8, 1950
    Nan Hanchen, President of the People's Bank of China

    The National Financial Industry Joint Conference opened on August 1st and closed on August 10th. A total of 103 representatives attended, including 21 from the People's Bank of China, 7 from joint public-private banks, 39 from private banks, 9 from native banks, 16 staff and workers, 7 from the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and 4 experts. The task of the conference was to study the adjustment of public-private relations in the financial industry, the relationship between the financial industry and industry and commerce, and labor-capital relations in the financial industry, based on the central government's policy of adjusting industry and commerce, so that the financial industry can be appropriately adjusted to reduce its negative effects, in order to maximize its positive role in benefiting industry and commerce.

    The current situation in the financial industry has changed. Due to the relative stability of currency and prices, the possibility of private financial institutions engaging in speculation is diminishing. The improvement of private industry and commerce has greatly increased the opportunities for private financial institutions to engage in serving production, assisting urban and rural exchanges, absorbing overseas remittances, and promoting capital repatriation. If private financial institutions can actively turn to these legitimate businesses and carry out self-rectification and transformation, they will also achieve a certain degree of development. At present, there is still potential to expand the connections between native banks and industry and commerce (the percentage of industrial and commercial households with bank accounts is 10% in Wuhan and slightly over 9% in Beijing). There is also the possibility of increasing deposits after currency stabilization. The current amount of deposits is still far from the scale that can be achieved under stable currency conditions. Private native banks still have conditions for development, but difficulties still exist. Small and medium-sized native banks have limited capital and business, and hope that the state bank will provide support in business. They are moving from joint operations to mergers, and hope to receive some encouragement and assistance. In addition to the general adjustment of public-private relations, large banks also hope that the government will assist them in streamlining and saving expenses, and appoint public shareholders to the board of directors.

    During the conference, it was first clearly determined that serving industry and commerce is the premise for the existence and development of the financial industry, and the operating methods of private financial institutions during the period of currency inflation were criticized. Then, the adjustment of public-private relations in the financial industry, the relationship between the financial industry and industry and commerce, and labor-capital relations in the financial industry were studied; at the same time, a draft of national management regulations for the banking industry was studied. The following conclusions were reached on the main issues during the conference:

    I. Adjusting Public-Private Relations in the Financial Industry: Before the conference, there was a mistaken idea in various places that public-private relations were mutually exclusive, believing that the development of state banks squeezed out native banks, so public-private relations were a matter of "who should eat from this bowl," emphasizing the need to divide the territory in business in the future. During the conference, this idea was gradually clarified, and instead, the need and possibility of overall consideration, appropriate leadership by state banks, and taking care of native banks were emphasized. State banks did make progress in business during the period when private native banks encountered difficulties in the first half of this year, but the deposits of state banks were more than 90% from government agencies and enterprises, and less than 8% from private individuals. The increase in deposits was mainly due to the implementation of cash management. The development of state banks and native banks is "treated equally." Businesses that native banks can handle are generally allowed to handle; however, the tasks of state banks are "different." They must complete the basic tasks assigned by the government to stabilize finance and develop production, and have the responsibility to lead and manage native banks. Joint public-private banks are treated the same as private native banks. The obligations and rights that joint-venture banks bear to the state's financial undertakings should be equal. In order to support private native banks in serving industry and commerce, the state bank decided to establish the following business connections: (1) Native banks develop remittances to support urban-rural exchanges, and the People's Bank can allocate funds on their behalf, with a 30% discount on the exchange rate; native banks can also act as agents for the People's Bank's remittances; (2) Native banks can apply to the People's Bank for re-mortgaging and re-discounting when loans to industry and commerce encounter difficulties in turnover, in order to encourage them to better serve industry and commerce; (3) Native banks may apply to handle entrusted businesses of the People's Bank, such as collecting taxes, acting as savings agents, insurance, etc.; (4) For native banks to develop business in small and medium-sized cities, it may be considered to allow them to relocate institutions in a planned manner; (5) Native banks are allowed to transfer funds to the People's Bank for deposit when credit is blocked and it is temporarily difficult to release funds.

    II. Adjusting the Relationship Between the Financial Industry and Industry and Commerce: The position of the financial industry serving industry and commerce was clearly defined, and several business issues related to the relationship with industry and commerce were jointly reviewed with representatives of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The following agreements were reached: (1) It was clearly determined that interest rates should be reduced and interest rate spreads should be narrowed. High interest rates are a product of currency inflation, and should be reduced immediately after currency stabilization. At present, due to partial adjustments in prices and general demand exceeding supply for funds, it is planned to take gradual, flexible, and measured steps to adjust interest rates, so that they approach pre-war levels. Interest rates should strive for consistency. At present, it is first required to align with Shanghai, which has lower interest rates, and Beijing and Tianjin should adjust and lower rates by the end of September. In the future, the People's Bank of China head office will stipulate the maximum loan interest rate nationwide, and the local interest rate committees will formulate interest rates based on the specific local conditions. The organization of the interest rate committee should be composed of representatives from the financial industry, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce; (2) Joint lending is a good way to concentrate funds to serve industry and commerce, and should be expanded with increased capital immediately. In addition to fixed funds, native banks may also temporarily add loans. Joint loans should focus on loans with longer periods and larger amounts, and consideration should also be given to small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises; (3) Public and private financial institutions advocate the establishment of investment companies in order to invest or provide long-term loans to industrial and commercial enterprises. The 10 billion yuan share subscription for the Beijing Xingye Investment Company was quickly completed, proving that the capital for industrial and commercial transformation and the idle funds of wealthy households are urgently seeking outlets; (4) In order to take into account the promotion of free lending, the current difficulty in obtaining industrial and commercial loans, and the large interest rate spread between deposits and loans in native banks, an agreement was reached to temporarily allow industrial and commercial enterprises to directly absorb funds from shareholders and employees without going through native banks (Shanghai factories absorb approximately 100 billion yuan in funds by themselves).

    III. Adjusting Labor-Capital Relations in the Financial Industry: Native banks had generous profits during the period of currency inflation, forming an unreasonable operating model, with bloated organizations, large numbers of personnel, high salaries, and huge expenses. At present, labor and management have not fully agreed on the opinions of streamlining, saving, and changing operating methods. During the conference, the Ministry of Labor convened representatives from the capitalist side, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened representatives from the labor side for discussions. The government competent authorities and the trade union will assist both labor and management in reaching agreements, so that the organization, personnel, and expenses of the financial industry can be adapted to the new situation after currency stabilization.

    IV. Study of the Draft National Management Regulations for the Banking Industry: After liberation, various localities have promulgated management regulations for private banking, which played a role in curbing speculation and stabilizing finance. At present, currency inflation has stopped, speculation may decrease, and the possibility of serving industry and commerce has increased. Therefore, there is an urgent need for national management regulations for the banking industry. Its spirit should be to encourage the banking industry to enrich its capital and consolidate its credit in order to serve industry and commerce, and the active provisions should be more than the negative restrictions. During the conference, the spirit and content of the draft were endorsed, and the following three points were discussed in detail, resulting in the following opinions: (1) The regulations for the capital amount of banking are divided into six levels: 20 billion, 10 billion, 5 billion, 2 billion, 1 billion, and 500 million; (2) Provisions should be made for the cash portion of the capital amount: at present, the capital of most banking institutions is mostly real estate, lacking cash, which is not conducive to capital turnover and increasing loans. After discussion, it was agreed that cash should account for 10% to 40% of the capital amount, and the smaller the capital, the larger the proportion of cash should be; (3) In order to ensure the interests of depositors, deposit reserve requirements should be stipulated: in the past, it was stipulated that banking institutions should deposit 15% of cash in the state bank, and now it is proposed to expand the deposit reserve amount to 15% to 30% of the deposit. The cash reserve portion is reduced to a minimum of 5%, and the remainder is a guarantee reserve, which is filled with public bonds, investment company investment amounts, and joint loan claims, in order to achieve the purpose of guaranteeing depositor benefits and promoting the centralized use of funds. The draft will be submitted for approval and promulgated and implemented at an appropriate time.

    The main gain of the conference was to point out the direction of development for the private financial industry. As long as it can serve industry and commerce, rectify its organization, streamline and save expenses, its business will be developed to a certain extent, and its operating conditions will improve. Native banks that prospered during currency inflation have difficulty surviving after currency stabilization. At the same time, social figures and even those in charge of native banks doubt whether native banks can exist, and confidence is very low. During this conference, native banks felt that the government not only pointed out the path, but also adjusted public-private relations, giving native banks support such as re-mortgaging, entrusted business, and exchange rate discounts, and confidence gradually recovered. Small and medium-sized native banks believe that small is not as good as large, and turn to consider joint operations or even mergers. In the future, when merging, they hope that the state bank will help solve the problem of surplus personnel, and intend to further approach the state bank through joint operations and mergers. Large banks require assistance in clearing non-performing loans, and it has been decided to organize non-performing loan clearing committees in various places. Shanghai has only 40 billion in non-performing loans, and we intend to assist in solving a portion of them. There are eight banks that require the government to take over enemy and puppet shares that should be confiscated according to law and appoint public shareholders to the board of directors, including Shanghai, Zhexing, Jin Cheng, Dalu, Zhongnan, Guohua, Hecheng, and Juxingcheng Banks. The state bank has agreed. The merger of small and medium-sized native banks and the active approach of large native banks to the state bank are tendencies toward centralization of the financial industry, which should be allowed. The financial undertaking is one of the important undertakings related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. According to the Common Program, it should be led by the state bank in order to realize the planned allocation of funds and ensure the planned economic construction.

    The conference representatives initiated the organization of the China Financial Society as an institution to unite public and private financial practitioners, strengthen learning, and improve policy and business levels, and decided to publish "China Finance" as a self-education publication for practitioners. In the future, the state bank should regard the institutions of native banks as a part of the state's financial undertaking, and regard the practitioners of native banks as talents in the state's financial undertaking, and actively provide education and training.

    Since the National Financial Industry Joint Conference, the business of both state banks and private native banks has developed significantly, with deposits increasing by an average of 20% to 30%. The direction of seeking common development in the process of public and private financial institutions serving industry and commerce pointed out at the conference has proved to be correct. After the autumn harvest, urban-rural exchanges are active, industry and commerce are improving, and business may be further developed. However, private financial institutions must not create blind optimism as a result, or even adopt the past improper operating methods in pursuit of business expansion. It would be even more wrong to think that the difficulties have been overcome and to deviate from the correct direction of development and engage in blind competition. The rapid increase in deposits in native banks is also difficult because the development and recovery of industry and commerce is gradually realized. Therefore, it is necessary to be calmly optimistic, and conscientiously abide by the direction pointed out by the National Financial Industry Joint Conference, and move forward steadily, in order to serve industry and commerce more effectively.

　　关于全国金融业联席会议的报告
    一九五○年九月八日向政务院第四十九次政务会议的报告
    中国人民银行行长  南汉宸
    全国金融业联席会议于八月一日开幕，十日闭幕。出席代表计一○三人，其中人民银行二十一人，公私合营银行七人，私营银行三十九人，钱庄九人，职工十六人，工商联七人，专家四人。会议的任务，在于根据中央调整工商业的方针，研究调整金融业中的公私关系，金融业与工商业的关系及金融业中的劳资关系，使金融业获得适当的调整，减少其消极作用，以便能够尽其有利于工商业的积极作用。
    目前金融业的情况，已发生变化。由于通货和物价已经相对稳定，私营金融业与投机联系的可能日趋缩小。而私营工商业的好转，使私营金融业从事于服务生产事业，协助城乡交流，吸收侨汇，促进资金回流的机会大为增多。私营金融业如能积极转向这些正当营业，并进行自我整顿改造，亦将有一定程度的发展。目前行庄与工商业的联系面尚有扩大可能（工商业户，在银行开户者，武汉为百分之十，北京为百分之九强），通货稳定后存款亦有增加的可能。目前存款数量距离通货稳定情况下可以达到的规模尚远。私营行庄尚有发展条件，但目前困难依然存在。中小行庄资力小，业务少，希望国家银行业务上予以支持；他们正在由联营走向合并，希望给他们一些鼓励与帮助。大银行除一般的调整公私关系外，还希望政府协助其进行精简节约，及指派公股董事。
    会议过程中，首先明确地确定了服务工商业是金融业存在与发展的前提，并批判了通货膨胀时期私营金融业的经营方式。然后，研究调整金融业中的公私关系，金融业与工商业的关系及金融业中的劳资关系；同时研究了全国性的银钱业管理办法草案。会议中对主要问题获得如下结论：
    一、调整金融业中的公私关系：会议之前各地曾经存在着公私关系是互相排挤的错误思想，认为国家银行的发展挤了行庄，因此公私关系是“一碗饭该谁吃”的问题，强调今后业务上的分疆而治。会议中逐渐澄清了这种思想，改而强调统筹兼顾，国行适当领导和照顾行庄的必要与可能。本年上期私营行庄遭遇困难时期，国家银行业务确有进展，但国家银行的存款，机关、企业占百分之九十以上，私人存款不及百分之八，存款增加，主要是由于实施现金管理的结果，国行与行庄的发展是“一视同仁”，凡是行庄可以办理的业务，一般的准许办理；但是国行的任务“有所不同”，它必须完成政府赋与稳定金融、发展生产的基本任务，并有领导及管理行庄的责任。公私合营银行与私营行庄一视同仁，合营银行对国家金融事业负担的义务与应享的权利应该相等。国行为了支持私营行庄服务工商业决定建立下列业务联系：（１）行庄开展汇兑扶助城乡交流，人民银行可以代为调拨资金，汇率七折优待；行庄并得代理人民银行汇兑；（２）行庄放款工商业发生周转不灵时，可向人民银行申请转抵押转贴现，以此鼓励其更好地服务工商业；（３）行庄得申请办理人民银行的委托业务，如代收税款、代理储蓄、保险等；（４）对行庄为开展中小城市业务，可以考虑准予有计划地移设机构；（５）行庄资金因信用阻滞一时不易放出时，准予转存人民银行。
    二、调整金融业与工商业的关系：明确确定金融业为工商业服务的立场，与工商联代表共同检讨了与工商业关系的几个业务问题。并得出如下协议：（１）明确地确定了利率应该下降，利差应该缩小。高利率是通货膨胀的产物，通货稳定后，应即下降。目前由于物价尚有局部调整，资金一般供不应求，因此拟采取和缓的步骤，逐步地、机动地、有幅度地调整利率，使接近于战前水平。利率应力求一致，目前先要求向利率较低之上海看齐，京、津两地应于九月底调整下降。今后利率由人民银行总行规定全国放款利率最高额，交由各地利率委员会根据当地具体情况，拟订利率。利率委员会之组织，应由金融业、工商联及工商局代表组成之；（２）联合放款为集中资金服务工商业良好方式，应即增资扩大。除固定基金外，行庄尚可临时搭放。联放应注重时期较长、数额较巨的放款，对中小型工商业亦应顾照；（３）公私金融业倡导组织投资公司，以便投资或长期贷款于工商业。北京兴业投资公司认股一百亿迅速完成，证明目前工商业转业资金及富户休闲资金正急切找寻出路；（４）对工商业不透过行庄自行吸收股东及职工资金（上海工厂自行吸收资金约达千亿），为了照顾到要提倡开展自由借贷，目前工商业贷金又很困难，及行庄存放利差较大等情况，获得暂准办理的协议。
    三、调整金融业中的劳资关系：行庄在通货膨胀时期利润优厚，形成不合理的经营方式，机构臃肿，人员众多，待遇较高，开支庞大。目前劳资双方对于精简节约，改变经营方式的意见，尚未完全一致。会议过程中，曾分由劳动部召集资方代表，中华全国总工会召集劳方代表进行座谈。政府主管当局及工会将协助劳资双方，进行协议，使金融业的机构、人员、开支，能够适合通货稳定后的新情况。
    四、研究全国性的银钱业管理办法草案：各地解放后，曾分别颁布私营银钱业管理办法，发生了制止投机，稳定金融的作用。目前通货膨胀已经停止，投机可能减少，服务工商业的可能增大，因此，全国性的银钱业管理办法已有迫切的需要。其精神应为鼓励银钱业充实资力、巩固信用，以服务工商业，积极的规定应多于消极的限制。会议中对草案的精神及内容均表赞同，对下列三点曾详加讨论，得出如下意见：（１）银钱业资本额的规定，分为二百亿、一百亿、五十亿、二十亿、十亿、五亿六等；（２）资本额中现金部分应有规定：目前一般行庄的资本多为房地产，缺少现金，不利于资金周转及增加放款，经讨论后，同意资本额中现金应占百分之十至百分之四十，资本愈小，其现金比例应愈大；（３）为保证存款人利益，存款准备金应予规定：过去规定行庄以现金百分之十五缴存国行，现拟将存款准备额扩大为存款的百分之十五至百分之三十。现金准备部分缩小为最低百分之五，其余为保证准备，以公债、投资公司投资额，联合放款债权充之，以达到保证存户利益及促使资金集中使用的目的。草案将呈请核定，并于适当时期公布施行。
    会议的主要收获是为私营金融业指出了发展的方向。只要它能为工商业服务，整顿组织，精简节约，其业务将得到一定程度的发展，经营状况亦将趋于好转。在通货膨胀中繁荣的行庄，在通货稳定后困难生存，同时社会人士甚至行庄负责人亦怀疑行庄能否存在，信心非常低落。此次会议中，行庄感觉到政府不但指出了道路，而且调整了公私关系，给行庄以转抵押、委托业务、汇兑折扣等支持，信心逐渐恢复。中小行庄认为小不如大，转而考虑联营甚至合并，将来合并时希望国家银行帮助解决过剩人员的出路，并有意通过联营合并，进一步靠拢国家银行。大银行要求协助清理呆账，已决定在各地组织呆账清理委员会，上海呆账仅四百亿，我们拟协助解决其中一部分。行庄要求政府接管属于依法应予没收之敌伪股份并指派公股董事者有上海、浙兴、金城、大陆、中南、国华、和成、聚兴诚银行等八家，国家银行已予同意。中小行庄的合并，及大行庄积极靠拢国家银行，是金融业集中化的倾向，是应该允许的方向。金融事业，为关系国计民生的重要事业之一，根据共同纲领，应由国家银行领导，以实现资金的有计划分配，保证经济建设的有计划进行。
    会议代表曾发起组织中国金融学会，作为团结公私金融从业人员，加强学习，提高政策与业务水平的机构，并决定发刊《中国金融》作为从业人员自我教育刊物。今后国家银行应视行庄机构为国家金融事业的一部分，视行庄从业人员为国家金融事业的人材，积极予以教育培养。
    全国金融业联席会议以来，国家银行及私营行庄的业务均有显著发展，存款平均增加百分之二十至三十。会议中指出的公私金融业在服务工商业过程中，求取共同发展的方向，已经证明了是正确的。秋收以后，城乡交流活跃，工商业好转，业务可能获得进一步的发展。但是私营金融业，决不可以因此造成盲目的乐观，甚至采取过去的不正当的经营方式，以追求业务的扩张。如果认为困难已经度过，可以背离正确的发展方向，进行盲目竞争，更是错误的。行庄存款急速增加也是困难的，因为工商业的发展与恢复，是逐步实现的。因此必须冷静乐观，切实遵照全国金融业联席会议所指出的方向，稳步前进，才能更有效地服务工商业。
