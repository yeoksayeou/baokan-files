Xinhua News Agency, September 29th—Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government delivered a speech at the banquet honoring representatives of all ethnic groups on September 29th. The full text is as follows:
Comrade Representatives, Comrades:

　　On behalf of the State Council of the Central People's Government, I extend a warm welcome to the representatives and cultural troupe members of all fraternal ethnic groups.

　　The fact that the representatives and cultural troupes of all fraternal ethnic groups have come to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations demonstrates the unprecedented great unity of all ethnic groups in China and the love of the people of all ethnic groups for their country. This makes us feel extremely excited.

　　For thousands of years, the various ethnic groups in China have been disunited, even mutually hostile. This is the result of the national oppression policies implemented by the reactionary ruling classes of successive dynasties, especially the imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionary rulers, in recent decades.

　　However, the situation in the past year has been very different. Thanks to the joint efforts of the people of all ethnic groups, we have overthrown the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang headed by Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism, and established the People's Republic of China. In this way, the relations between the various ethnic groups in China have undergone a fundamental change, from the relationship of oppression and being oppressed in the past to a relationship of equality and mutual assistance. Over the past year, the People's Government has implemented the ethnic policies in the Common Program, making every effort to eliminate the remaining estrangement and contradictions between the various ethnic groups and strengthen the unity of the people of all ethnic groups. And to the greatest extent possible, it has assisted all minority ethnic groups in developing their political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings. As for the internal reforms of the various ethnic groups, we have adopted a prudent and steady approach in accordance with the awareness and will of the majority of the people of the various ethnic groups. Doing so is fully in line with the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. Today, not only are the various ethnic groups in China closely united, but the love for their motherland is also growing in the hearts of the people of all ethnic groups.

　　However, we must not be satisfied with this. We should further strengthen and consolidate ethnic unity. We should implement the policy of ethnic regional autonomy step by step and practically. We should help the people of all ethnic groups train and cultivate thousands upon thousands of cadres, and strive to gradually improve and raise the economic and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups, so as to build the People's Republic of China into a big family of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups.

　　Finally, let us drink to celebrate the unprecedented great unity of all ethnic groups in China.

　　周总理在宴会上致词
    【新华社二十九日讯】中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理二十九日在欢宴各民族代表的宴会致词，全文如下：各位代表、各位同志：
    我代表中央人民政府政务院向各兄弟民族的代表们和文工团团员们表示热烈的欢迎。
    各兄弟民族的代表和文工团这次到北京来参加庆祝国庆节，显示着中国各兄弟民族空前的大团结和中国各民族人民对于自己国家的热爱。这使我们感到异常的兴奋。
    几千年来，中国各民族是不团结的，甚至是互相仇视的。这是由于历代反动统治阶级、特别是最近几十年来的帝国主义及其走狗中国反动统治者实行民族压迫政策的结果。
    可是近一年来的情况大不相同了。由于我们各民族人民的共同努力，我们打倒了以美帝国主义走狗蒋介石为首的国民党反动统治，并建立了中华人民共和国。这样中国各民族之间的关系便有了根本的改变，从过去压迫和被压迫的关系改变为平等、互助的关系。一年来，人民政府实行了共同纲领中的民族政策，尽力消除各民族间残存的隔阂和矛盾，加强各民族人民的团结。并尽可能地帮助各少数民族发展其政治、经济和文化建设事业。而对于各民族的内部改革，则按照各民族大多数人民的觉悟和志愿，采取慎重稳进的方针。这样做，是完全符合我国各民族人民利益的。今天，中国各民族不但亲密地团结起来了，而且在各民族人民心里日益滋长着对于自己祖国的热爱。
    但是不能就此满足，我们应该更进一步地加强和巩固民族团结，我们应该有步骤地和切实地实现民族的区域自治政策，我们应该帮助各民族人民训练和培养成千成万的干部，并为逐步改善和提高各民族人民的经济、文化生活水平而努力，以便将中华人民共和国建设成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭。
    最后，让我们为庆祝我们中国各民族的空前大团结而干杯。
