Xinhua News Agency, London, 13th: The 82nd Annual Conference of the British Trades Union Congress, which began on September 4th in Brighton, proved that the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of Trades Union Congress members with the Labour government's policy of betraying the interests of the working class is increasing daily and has been openly expressed in opposition. Despite the overbearing manipulation and control of the General Council, and the personal appearance of Attlee to intimidate and deceive, the delegates at the meeting still passed a resolution on the 7th with a majority of 222,000 votes, demanding the immediate cancellation of the wage freeze and the implementation of profit restrictions, and protesting against the government's failure to take effective measures to prevent the continued growth of profits in order to prevent price increases. The conference also rejected the General Council's pre-drafted report supporting the wage freeze.

This important resolution of the conference is a serious blow to the Labour government, which is trying its best to drag Britain into a war economy under the orders of the United States. Before the vote on this motion, British Prime Minister Attlee personally addressed the conference on the 5th, asking the British working class to support his arms expansion and war preparation plan. After acknowledging that this plan "has some impact on the living standards of British workers" and that "the losses caused by continuous inflation have been aggravated by the increase in military spending," he dictatorially demanded that workers continue to implement the wage freeze and endure the sacrifices caused by war preparation. Attlee even blatantly declared, "I ask all of you to regard the deterioration of working conditions as your contribution to 'national security'."

However, Attlee's remarks did not prevent the Trades Union Congress members from overturning the resolution supporting the wage freeze policy, which was passed at the previous annual conference of the Trades Union Congress in early September last year under the manipulation of right-wing leaders. This means that the Labour government's policy of forcing real wages to decline day by day, despite the devaluation of the pound by one-third last September and the subsequent continuous rise in prices, has gone bankrupt; the implementation of the British government's arms expansion plan has therefore encountered significant difficulties. According to United Press, "This vote presents a new problem for the Labour government. Unless Attlee and his ministers agree to a general wage increase, there will be a series of strikes."

In the vote on foreign policy issues, although the General Council's reactionary report supporting the US aggression against Korea and the British government's arms expansion plan was passed under the high-pressure manipulation of the General Council, it still revealed the increasing anti-war sentiment of the workers. Five trade unions put forward proposals demanding the reopening of international negotiations on the control of atomic energy and the prohibition and destruction of atomic bombs. Although this was ultimately rejected, a quarter of the members, representing nearly two million votes, still voted in favor of declaring atomic bombs illegal. Before the vote, General Council spokesman Deakin's crude anti-Soviet speech was repeatedly interrupted by indignant listeners.

### 反对工党政府出卖工人阶级利益  英职工大会以廿二万票通过决议  要求立即取消工资冻结并实行限制利润

　　反对工党政府出卖工人阶级利益
    英职工大会以廿二万票通过决议
    要求立即取消工资冻结并实行限制利润
    【新华社十三日讯】伦敦消息：九月四日起在布来屯举行的英国职工大会八十二届年会，证明职工大会的广大会员群众对工党政府出卖工人阶级利益的政策的不满，正在日益增加，并已公开表示反对。虽然有最高委员会横暴地操纵把持，与艾德礼亲自出场恫吓欺骗，但与会代表还是在七日会议上以二十二万二千票的多数，通过决议，要求立即取消工资冻结和实行限制利润，并抗议政府未采取有效措施防止利润继续增长的趋势，以防止物价上涨。大会同时否决了最高委员会包办拟订的支持冻结工资的报告。
    大会的这一重要决议，对于正在美国命令下竭力把英国拖上战争经济的工党政府，乃是一个严重的打击。在表决这一议案以前，英国首相艾德礼曾于五日亲向大会发表演说，要求英国工人阶级支持其扩军备战计划，他在承认这个计划“对英国工人的生活水准有若干影响”与“通货不断膨胀所造成的损失，已因军费的增加而加重”后，专横地要求工人们继续实行工资冻结，忍受因备战而引起的牺牲。艾德礼甚至明目张胆地宣称，我要求你们大家把工作条件的恶化当作自己对“国家安全的贡献”。
    但是艾德礼的这些说辞，并没有能阻止职工大会会员群众推翻去年九月初职工大会上届年会在右翼领导分子操纵下通过的支持冻结工资政策的议案。这就意味着工党政府不顾去年九月英镑贬值三分之一和继之而来的物价不断上涨而强使实际工资日益降低的政策，已经沦于破产；英国政府扩军计划之实行，因此已遭到了重大困难。据合众社称：“这次表决对工党政府提出了一个新问题。除非艾德礼和他的大臣们同意全面增加工资，否则就会有一系列的罢工发生。”
    在关于外交政策问题的表决中，虽然在最高委员会的高压操纵下，通过了最高委员会支持美国侵略朝鲜和英国政府扩军计划的反动报告。但是也仍然表露了工人们反战情绪的增涨。五个工会提出了要求重开国际管制原子能谈判和禁止并销毁原子弹的提议，这虽然最后遭到否决，但在表决时仍有四分之一会员，代表近两百万票赞成宣布原子弹为非法。表决以前，最高委员会发言人狄金的粗暴的反苏演说屡次为愤慨的听众们所打断。
