According to the Wanbei Daily News: The Huai River shallow section dredging project began trial operation on the 9th of this month. The Huai River Engineering Office of the East China Construction Engineering Company, under the East China Industrial Department, arrived in Zhengyangguan on the 26th of last month to cooperate with the Mechanical Dredging Engineering Team of the Huai River Engineering Headquarters. Four dredgers and seventy-two barges have arrived (with another twenty-nine en route from Bengbu), and a preliminary decision has been made to mobilize 300 disaster victims from the local area to participate in soil carrying, using work as relief.

Regarding the dredging steps, the Huai River Water Conservancy Engineering Headquarters has decided that, in order to strive to drain the accumulated water above Zhengyangguan and to utilize the water flow to scour the riverbed in coordination with the construction of embankments, the section from upstream of Zhengyangguan to Liuzikou in Huoqiu County, about eight kilometers long, will be dredged first. The central channel will be excavated to a width of 20 meters and an average depth of 2.5 meters, involving approximately 500,000 cubic meters of earthwork. In addition, the Lu Kouzi and Qiao Kouzi shoals (belonging to Fengtai County) below Zhengyangguan, totaling about three kilometers in length, must be dredged simultaneously to increase the scouring volume, with a width of 40 meters and an average depth of over one meter, totaling approximately 130,000 cubic meters of earthwork. After the completion of the above projects, other shallow sections downstream and the mouths of tributary rivers will be dredged, limited to 180,000 cubic meters. Including Lu Kouzi and Qiao Kouzi, the total earthwork is approximately 300,000 cubic meters.

　　淮河浅段疏浚试工
    以工代赈动员灾民参加
    【本报讯】据皖北日报消息：淮河浅段疏浚工程，本月九日已开始试工。华东区工业部华东建筑工程公司淮河工程处于上月二十六日到正阳关，配合淮河工程总局机械疏浚工程队进行工作。已开到挖泥机船四只，驳船七十二只（续有二十九只自蚌埠开来），并初步决定用以工代赈方式在当地动员灾民三百人参加挑土。
    关于疏浚步骤，经淮河水利工程总局决定：为争取疏导正阳关以上积水，利用水流冲刷河床与配合堤工修筑起见，先行疏浚正阳关上游至霍邱溜子口一段，长约八公里，开挖中泓宽二十公尺，平均挖深二·五公尺，土方约五十万公方。又正阳关下鲁口子、乔口子（属凤台县）两浅滩共长约三公里，须同时开挖中泓，以增加冲水量，计宽四十公尺，平均挖深约一公尺以上，约计土方十三万公方。待以上工程完竣后，再疏浚下游其他浅滩及支流河口，以十八万公方为限。连鲁口子、乔口子，共计土方约三十万公方。
