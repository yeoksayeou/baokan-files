　　Mao Zedong Locomotive (Medium-length Serial)
    By Ding Kexin and Qingying
    Twenty-Eight, "Now I understand everything."
    Zheng Dugong told Old Hero about his quarrel with Old Shang.
    Old Hero advised him:
    "Comrades should unite. If there are opinions, raise them to each other. Don't get into a rut. If you get into a rut, the work will not be done well; if the work is bad, all the comrades of the Mao Zedong Locomotive will lose face, and everyone will be disgraced...…"
    Old Zheng felt that Old Hero's words were all correct, but he did not speak. He thought: Old Hero is really very different from before...…
    "Before," Old Hero continued, "I didn't know how to unite with my comrades, and I didn't do my work well. Now when I think about it, it's really... For example, when I argued with you before, it was all my fault, and I should be responsible! … …"
    Old Zheng was so upset that he was about to cry, and interrupted Old Hero's words:
    "Old Hero, don't say that...…" He couldn't go on.
    Just then, Guo Shude came. Old Zheng often saw Guo Shude looking for Li Yong. Before, when he saw it, he would mutter in his heart: "I wonder what kind of tricks they are talking about?" But at this moment, he didn't think that way. He thought: He's probably looking for Old Hero to talk about the Communist Party! Old Hero has changed so much that he is fully qualified to join the Party! Thinking of this, and then thinking of himself, his face burned hotly, so he stood up to leave, and said:
    "You talk."
    Guo Shude stopped him and said:
    "There's nothing special, let's talk."
    Old Hero told Old Guo about Old Shang and Old Zheng's quarrel, and said that he had already advised Old Zheng.
    At this moment, Old Zheng was really about to cry. He said to Guo Shude:
    "Oh, Guo the driver, I'm really not on the right path, I've gone astray. Someone like me is not worthy of being a member of the working class! … …"
    Guo Shude comforted him well, and finally encouraged him, saying:
    "Don't be discouraged. It's good to know that you were wrong in the past. If you resolutely change in the future, who can't make a mistake? It's okay as long as you can change."
    These words made Old Zheng's face turn red, but he left happily.
    As soon as Old Zheng left, Guo Shude recalled the instructions of the branch secretary and Representative Zhang, and then asked Old Hero what opinions he had of himself. Old Hero had no opinion, saying that he had been a great help to him, and hoped to get more help in the future. Guo Shude asked several times, saying that he had been here for two or three months, and that he couldn't possibly have no opinion at all, but Old Hero still said that he really didn't have any.
    Guo Shude smiled and then asked:
    "Then what do you think of the Communist Party?"
    Li Yong was stunned for a moment, but then seemed to understand and said:
    "I said it at the criticism meeting and the study meeting, the Communist Party is for the people, Chairman Mao leads well, no opinion."
    Guo Shude smiled again and said:
    "You say the Communist Party is good, so why don't you join the Party?"
    "Me!" Old Hero became very uncomfortable: "I'll wait until I've made contributions and achieved results before I gloriously join the Party. Now I think I'm not qualified enough."
    Guo Shude laughed even harder:
    "You made contributions two years ago. The Mao Zedong Locomotive is the leader of the locomotives, and you are the chief driver. Whose contribution is greater than yours?" He paused and said: "You must have an opinion on the Communist Party, right?"
    "No way!" Old Hero was anxious: "I really have no opinion, don't believe those gossipy people!"
    "Do you have an opinion about confiscating your rice?"
    This question stumped Old Hero, and his eyes glazed over. He didn't answer for a long time.
    Guo Shude didn't look at him and waited.
    Old Hero finally said:
    "I figured out the rice thing a long time ago. If it weren't for the rice, things wouldn't have turned out so bad. It's my fault."
    "You weren't satisfied at the time, were you?"
    "I wasn't satisfied at the time, but I wasn't satisfied with the investigation team." He tried hard to defend himself.
    "But the investigation team is also led by the Communist Party."
    "I understand now," he poured a glass of water and drank it: "At the beginning, I really couldn't figure it out, and I was so upset all day long, but I didn't slack off in my work, and I really had a knot in my heart. Later, Representative Zhang explained it to me, and I was much brighter. You came and made me criticize myself and study, and now I understand everything: Private business hinders work! Think about it, when you get to an outer station and stop for half an hour, you rush to buy things, so you don't have time to check the locomotive; when you get back to Harbin, you rush to sell things, and you don't have time to wipe the car. How can you do a good job like this!"
    Guo Shude continued:
    "What you said is one aspect; another aspect: Smuggling was forced by the reactionaries because the workers had no livelihood and had to do this. The Communist Party is the party of the working class and is for the benefit of the masses. It does not allow smuggling, not because it does not care about the lives of the workers, but because it starts from the overall work. If we do a good job, increase transportation volume, and produce more, the workers' lives can be improved. So we can't just look at the present, we should look far ahead, and the difficulties in front of us are for the future...…"
    "I don't have any difficulties now," Li Yong said emotionally: "The section and the trade union saw that my family has a large population. After the rice was confiscated, they have been giving me a lot of help...…"
    Old Hero was about to continue, when he suddenly heard the rumbling of the train from far to near, and then he heard the clear and loud sound of the copper警 bell "Dang! Dang! Dang!". Hearing this, his spirits were particularly lifted. He and Guo Shude smiled at each other, and both their eyes were saying: Old Shang and the others are back!
    "Let's go, let's go see them!"
    The two stood up at the same time and walked to the platform one after the other. (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影作
    二十八、“现在我全明白了。”
    郑笃恭把和老商吵嘴的事告诉了老英雄。
    老英雄劝他道：
    “同志要团结，有意见互相提，可别闹蹩扭，一蹩扭工作就搞不好；工作坏了，毛泽东号的全体同志丢人，大家都不光彩。………”
    老郑觉得老英雄的话句句对，可是他没有说话，他想：老英雄真正跟以前大不一样了。………
    “我以前，”老英雄又说：“不知道和同志们团结，工作没有做好，现在想起来真……比方以前跟你闹，都是我不对，我要负责！………”
    老郑竟难过得要哭的样子，打断老英雄的话道：
    “老英雄，你可别这么说。………”他说不下去了。
    正在这时候，郭树德来了。老郑常见郭树德找李永，以前一见心里就嘀咕：“不知又谈什么闹什么花样啦？”可是此刻他不这末想了。他想：大概是找老英雄谈共产党的事哩！老英雄这一改，入党是满够条件的！想到这里，又想到自己，脸就麻辣辣的烧起来，就站起身要走，并且说：
    “你们谈吧。”
    郭树德拦住他道：
    “没有什么事，谈谈吧。”
    老英雄就把老商老郑吵嘴的事对老郭说了一遍，并且说他已经劝了老郑一番。
    此刻老郑真的就要哭出来了，他对郭树德道：
    “唉，郭大车，我算是没走大道，走了斜岔了，我这号的真不配是工人阶级！……”
    郭树德好好安慰了他一番，末了鼓励他说：
    “别丧气，知道过去错了就好，以后坚决的改，谁还能不犯一点错呢？能改就行。”
    这一番话，把老郑说的脸通红，可是高高兴兴地走了。
    老郑一走，郭树德把支部书记和张代表的指示再回想了一遍，就征求老英雄对自己有什么意见。老英雄没有意见，说对他帮助很大，以后还希望多帮助。郭树德又征求了好几遍，说他来了两三个月了，不会一点意见也没有的，老英雄还是说真的一点也没有。
    郭树德笑了，就接着问：
    “那末你对共产党有什么意见？”
    李永愣了一下，马上似乎又弄清了说：
    “我在检讨会学习会上都说了，共产党为人民，毛主席领导的好，没意见。”
    郭树德又笑笑说：
    “你说共产党好，那你为什么不入党？”
    “我！”老英雄变得很不自在：“我等立了功有了成绩再光荣入党，现在我合计着还不够条件。”
    郭树德更加笑了起来：
    “你两年以前就立了功，毛泽东号是机车领袖，你是司机长，谁的功比你大？”停了停：“你对共产党一定有意见吧？”
    “可没有！”老英雄急了：“我真的没意见，你可别相信人们那贫嘴！”
    “没收你的大米是不是有意见？”
    这一问老英雄被问住了，两眼一迷糊，半天没有回答上来。
    郭树德就不看他，等着。
    老英雄到底说了：
    “大米的事我早想开了，要不为大米，还不会弄的那么坏，这是我的错。”
    “当时你不满意吧？”
    “当时不满意也是不满意纠查队。”他极力表白。
    “可是纠查队也是共产党领导的呀。”
    “我现在明白了，”他倒了一杯水喝：“一开头我真是想不开，成天烦的不知怎么好，别看工作不松劲，心里真是挽着个疙瘩，后来张代表跟我一解释，我就豁亮多了，你来了又闹检讨又闹学习，现在我全明白了：私做买卖妨碍工作！你想，一到外站，停半个钟头，赶紧去买东西，也就顾不上检点机车了；回到哈尔滨，又赶紧去卖东西，又没有时间擦车了，这样一来，业务怎么能搞好！”
    郭树德接着说：
    “你说的是一方面；再一方面：倒老客（走私）是反动派逼的工人没生活，不得不干这个，共产党是工人阶级的政党，是为大众谋利益的。他不准走私，不是不关心工人的生活，是从整个工作出发。咱工作搞的好，运输量提高，生产的多，工人生活就可以改善。所以不能只顾眼前，应当看得远，眼前困难一点是为了将来…………”
    “我眼前不困难了，”李永感动地说：“段上和工会看我家里人口多，没收大米以后，一直给我不少帮助……”
    老英雄还要说下去，忽听到列车的隆隆响声从远而近，接着就听到铜警钟“当！当！当”的声音，清脆而响亮。一听见这，精神就格外振奋起来，他和郭树德相对一笑，两人眼睛都在说：老商他们回来啦！
    “走，看看他们去！”
    两人同时站起来，一先一后走向站台去。（附图片）
