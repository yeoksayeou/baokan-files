　　Polish Youth Standing at the Forefront of Production Labor
    ——An Interview with Polish Representative Golarski

    Golarski, the Polish representative participating in the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation's visit to China and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish Youth League, spoke to reporters about the Polish youth's active participation in production and construction, and their struggle to defend world peace.

    Golarski said: Polish youth are fond of labor. As early as 1945, when Fascist Germany was defeated and surrendered, Polish youth devoted themselves to selfless labor to restore one of Poland's important industries, the textile industry.

    Polish youth have organized 6,000 labor service teams in various regions, with 50,000 participants. With heroic blitz work, they completed the restoration of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, and built many highways, railways, and other projects. In 1949, Polish youth responded to the call of the government and the United Workers' Party, and organized voluntary labor teams again, with 100,000 participants. They worked five hours a day, and spent the rest of their time studying. This year is the first year of Poland's Six-Year Plan, and Polish youth are working with the people of the whole country to strive for the realization of this plan. Many labor heroes and models have emerged among them: Li Binska, a member of the Polish Youth League, is a nationally famous textile worker. Due to his outstanding labor achievements, he has been awarded the title of Labor Hero three times and has been awarded the Medal of the President of the Republic; steelworker Kolowski is famous throughout the country for exceeding the production plan by 300%, and coal miner Bannasiak is famous for exceeding the plan by 245%.

    Golarski talked about the Polish youth's struggle to defend world peace, saying: Poland was a country severely damaged in World War II. Polish youth have tasted Hitler Germany's bloody rule for six years, so their hatred of war is unparalleled. The Polish Youth League is the organizer of the Polish youth's struggle to defend peace. It uses newspapers and periodicals, and conducts extensive propaganda and education work to the youth through open forums and lectures to strengthen their understanding of the cause of peace. Polish youth also enthusiastically responded to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, and launched a campaign to collect signatures for the Peace Declaration across the country, with 280,000 members participating. Golarski emphasized: The US imperialist armed aggression against Korea and Taiwan has pushed Poland's peace movement to a new stage of development. Youths in various regions angrily held demonstrations and protest rallies. The Youth League also mobilized students from thirteen universities and workers from various factories to write letters to young students and workers in the United States and Britain, calling on them to refuse to serve the war-mongers. At the same time, Polish youth fully understand that their most effective contribution to the cause of peace is to further strengthen the strength of the motherland. Now, workers and peasants all over the country are launching a large-scale production competition to welcome the Second World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The Polish Youth League issued a resounding call: "Youths! Stand at the forefront of laboring for the motherland! Fight to complete the Six-Year Plan!"

    Golarski finally said enthusiastically: Although Poland and New China are separated by thousands of miles, Polish youth are always thinking about their fighting partners—Chinese youth. They are very concerned about China. At conferences and rallies held in various places, Polish youth excitedly talked about New China. Last November, the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation, headed by Xiao Hua, a member of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China, visited Poland and was warmly welcomed by youth from all over Poland. Many local youths felt very sorry for not having seen the messengers of the Chinese youth in person. Now, the International Liaison Department of the Polish Youth League is publishing news reports dedicated to introducing the activities of democratic youth in the Soviet Union, China and other countries to enhance the friendship between Polish youth and world youth.

　　站在生产劳动前列的波兰青年
    ——访问波兰代表戈拉尔斯基
    参加世界民主青年联盟代表团访问我国的波兰代表、波兰青年联盟中央委员会书记戈拉尔斯基，向记者谈述了波兰青年积极进行生产建设与保卫世界和平的斗争情况。
    戈拉尔斯基说：波兰青年是热爱劳动的。远在一九四五年法西斯德国溃败投降的时候起，波兰青年就投身于忘我的劳动，来恢复波兰重要工业之一的纺织工业。
    波兰青年曾在各地组织了六千个劳动服务队，参加者达五万人。他们以英雄式的突击工作，完成了波兰首都华沙的复兴工作，并修筑了许多公路、铁路及其他工程。一九四九年，波兰青年响应了政府和统一工人党的号召，又组织了义务劳动队，参加的有十万人，他们每天工作五小时，其余时间则进行学习。今年正是波兰六年计划开始的第一个年头，波兰青年正与全国人民一道为争取这个计划的实现而努力。他们当中不断地涌现了许许多多的劳动英雄与模范：波兰青年联盟盟员李宾斯卡，是全国著名的纺织工人，由于卓越的劳动成绩，他曾三度荣膺劳动英雄的称号，并荣获共和国总统奖章；炼钢工人科洛夫斯基因超过生产计划百分之三百，煤矿工人班纳夏克因超过计划百分之二百四十五而闻名全国。
    戈拉尔斯基谈到了波兰青年进行保卫世界和平的斗争说：波兰是第二次世界大战中受创很重的国家，波兰青年曾备尝了希特勒德国六年的血腥统治，因此，他们对战争的憎恨是无比的。波兰青年联盟是波兰青年保卫和平斗争的组织者，它利用了报纸、刊物，通过了公开的座谈会与讲演会，向青年们进行广泛的宣传与教育工作，以加强他们对于和平事业的认识。波兰青年还热烈地响应了世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的号召，在全国展开了为和平宣言征集签名的运动，参加的盟员达二十八万人。戈拉尔斯基强调地说：美帝国主义武装侵略朝鲜和台湾，把波兰的和平运动推向了新的发展阶段。各地的青年们愤怒地举行示威游行和抗议大会。青年联盟还发动了十三个大学的学生及各工厂的工人们，写信给美国和英国的青年学生与工人们，号召他们拒绝为战争贩子服务。同时，波兰青年十分明白：他们对和平事业的最有效的贡献，就是进一步加强祖国的实力。现在，全国各地的工人与农民正为迎接第二届世界拥护和平大会而展开大规模的生产竞赛。波兰青年联盟发出了响亮的号召：“青年们！站在为祖国而劳动的最前列！为完成六年计划而斗争！”
    戈拉尔斯基最后热情地说：波兰与新中国虽远隔万里，但波兰青年无时不在想念着他们的战斗伙伴——中国青年。他们非常关心中国。在各地举行的大会与集会上，波兰青年们都兴奋地谈起新中国。去年十一月间，以中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会委员萧华为首的中国民主青年代表团访问波兰，受到了波兰各地青年们的热烈欢迎，许多地方的青年都由于没有亲见中国青年的使者而大感遗憾。现在，波兰青年联盟国际联络部正出版新闻汇报，专门介绍苏联、中国及其他各国民主青年的活动情况，以增进波兰青年与世界青年的友谊。（附图片）
