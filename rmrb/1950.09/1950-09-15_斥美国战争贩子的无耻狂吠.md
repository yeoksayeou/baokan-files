　　Denouncing the Shameful Howls of American Warmongers
　　Hu Zhongchi
　　While the American imperialists refused the Soviet Union's proposals in the Security Council for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and a proper handling of our country's accusations against the United States, they continue to carry out their bloody war of aggression in Korea, establish a wartime economic system, and intensify preparations for a new war. These facts fully demonstrate that the American government is consciously following the fascist path of Hitler and Tojo. However, the American people and the people of the world love peace and hate the criminal wars of fascism. Under these circumstances, American President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson shamelessly delivered some absurd radio speeches in order to cover up their wolfish faces with a "peace" sheepskin. These speeches, like all the sophistry of American representative Austin in the Security Council, are all weak and lacking in reason. But from the standpoint of the Chinese people and the standpoint of the world peace camp, we cannot but denounce the absurd and shameless howls of these two warmongers at the beck and call of Wall Street.
　　In his two speeches on September 1st and 8th, Truman's weak defense of his own aggressive war against Korea fully revealed a guilty conscience. He knew that the American people would ask: Why should our children go all the way to far and unfamiliar Korea to die in vain? He explained: in order to "once again engage in the age-old struggle for human freedom". Let us just cite two examples to examine Truman's so-called "struggle for human freedom". According to a report by Osborne, the correspondent in Korea for the American magazine *Time*, published on August 21st: "I have to say this is a terrible war. Because in order to win, we force our soldiers to adopt savage actions and styles on the battlefield… regardless of whether there are enemies there, villages are completely destroyed; refugees are indiscriminately killed.” Also, according to a dispatch from the Paris newspaper *Le Monde* "SOS to the United Nations", in the concentration camps set up by the Americans, 300,000 Korean people are suffering from hunger, groaning, waiting to die, and are thrown into the abyss of terror. In such a "struggle for human freedom," Truman shamelessly boasted: "In less than eight weeks, five divisions of American troops have entered the battle." "Our troops are fighting with amazing bravery." Everyone knows how low the morale of the American troops on the front line is. Truman's so-called "bravery" is only maintained by inhumane bombing with tens of thousands of tons of bombs. Yet he still has the nerve to say that the purpose of this war is for international peace and justice, demanding that the American armed forces be increased from 1.5 million to about 3 million, and rapidly increasing the production of guns, tanks, aircraft, and other military equipment. Not only that, but he also "invites all countries in the world to participate in this great work." Here the true face of a fascist war criminal is completely exposed, exactly the same as Hitler and the Japanese generals he himself mentioned ten years ago. However, the American imperialists are ultimately outwardly strong but inwardly weak. He has to use a set of nice-sounding words like freedom and peace to cover up his fascist nature. This is enough to prove that the American people cannot support his fascist aggression. Truman's September 1st speech ended with the sentence "Ask God to cleanse us of all selfish and base thoughts," which vividly reflects the selfish and base inner world of a cowardly warmonger.
　　Acheson's equally absurd and shameless radio speech on September 10th was a supplement to Truman's speech. He made unbridled slander and libel against the Soviet Union and China with blatant lies, but like Truman, he pretended to be friends with the Chinese people. How is his friendship expressed? It is that "Taiwan should be neutralized" and deliberately fabricate the so-called "future problem of Taiwan", using the intervention of the Seventh Fleet to create a long-term occupation fact. It is to "establish a clear future relationship between Japan and the rest of the world", fostering the forces of Japanese militarism and strengthening the threat to China. It is to "give all possible assistance" to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan, continuing to be enemies with the Chinese people. In order to maliciously slander the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and unable to find a gap, he even shamelessly brought up the rumors that he himself had slapped in the face long ago, saying that "Xinjiang, Outer Mongolia (?) and Manchuria are currently only nominally Chinese." He openly tore up the Cairo Declaration, saying that it is only "an important factor to be considered in future resolutions." He even clearly stated that he wanted to make the people of Asia "regardless of nationality" become like the Philippines. Everyone knows that the Philippines is a pitiful colony controlled by American imperialism. Such absurd remarks by warmongers can be said to be the ultimate in insulting the Chinese people and all the people of Asia.
　　In the shameless howls of these two major American warmongers, and in the shameless sophistry of the American representative in the Security Council, we have clearly seen the sinister face of the American imperialists who are incorrigible. We, the 475 million Chinese people, have the full strength and determination to defend the sacred territory and sovereignty of our motherland. We are not afraid of the empty threats of bloody warmongers. We must intensify our efforts at the forefront of the world peace camp and continue to struggle to stop the crimes of warmongers preparing for a new world war of aggression. The final victory must belong to us.

　　斥美国战争贩子的无耻狂吠
    胡仲持
    美国帝国主义者一面在安理会上拒绝了苏联所提出的和平解决朝鲜问题和正确处理我国控诉美国等提案，一面继续进行其在朝鲜的血腥侵略战争，并建立战时经济体制，加紧新战争的准备。这种事实充分证明美国政府有意识地走着希特勒和东条的法西斯道路。然而美国人民和世界人民都是爱好和平，痛恨法西斯的罪恶战争的。在这种情势之下，美国总统杜鲁门和国务卿艾奇逊无耻地发表了一些荒谬的广播演说，为的是要用一张“和平”的羊皮遮盖它本身的豺狼面目。这些演说，正同美国代表奥斯汀在安理会的一切强辩一样，都是词穷理屈，软弱无力的。可是我们站在中国人民的立场，站在世界和平阵营的立场，对于这两个听受华尔街差遣的战争贩子的荒谬无耻的狂吠不能不加以痛斥。
    杜鲁门在其九月一日和八日的两次演说中间，对于他自己所发动的对朝鲜的侵略战争的无力的辩解充分显出了做贼心虚。他知道美国人民要问：为什么叫我们的孩子们平白地到老远而且生疏的朝鲜去送死呢？他便解释道：为的是“再一次从事于历史悠久的为人类自由的斗争”。我们单举两个实例来检查一下杜鲁门所谓“为人类自由的斗争”罢。据八月二十一日出版的美国《时代》周刊上所刊载的该刊驻朝鲜记者奥斯本的报道：“我得说这是一场恐怖的战争。因为我们要获取胜利，所以就强迫自己的兵士们在战场上采取野蛮的行动和作风。……不管那里有没有敌人，见了村庄就整个整个彻底摧毁；对于难民就不分皂白地杀害。”又据巴黎《世界报》记者“向联合国呼救”的通讯，在美国人所设立的集中营里，三十万朝鲜人民挨着饥饿，呻吟待毙，并被抛入恐怖的深渊中”。杜鲁门就在这样的“为人类自由的斗争”中，无耻地夸耀着：“不到八个星期，五师美国军队已进入战斗。”“我们的军队作战是惊人的英勇。”大家都知道在前线的美军士气是怎样低落，杜鲁门的所谓“英勇”只是用成万吨的炸弹的惨无人道的轰炸来维持的。然而他还老着脸皮硬说这种战争的目的是为了国际间的和平与正义，要求美国武装力量从一百五十万增加到三百万左右，并急速提高枪炮坦克飞机及其他军事装备的生产力量。不但如此，他还“邀请世界所有国家来参加这个伟大的工作”。在这儿完全暴露了法西斯战犯的真面目。恰正同他自己所提到的十年以前希特勒和日本将军们一模一样。然而美国帝国主义者究竟是外强中干的。他不得不用一套自由和平之类好听的字眼，把自己的法西斯本色遮掩一番。这正足以证明美国人民是不能支持他的法西斯侵略的。杜鲁门在九月一日的演说，用“请求上帝清除我们一切自私和卑劣的念头”这句话来作结束也就把一个贼胆心虚的战争贩子的自私和卑劣的内心反映得淋漓尽致了。
    艾奇逊九月十日所发表的同样荒谬无耻的广播演说，是给杜鲁门作补充的。他用弥天大谎对苏联和中国作着尽情的诽谤和诬蔑，可也正同杜鲁门一样，假惺惺拉中国人民做朋友。他的友谊表示怎样呢？就是“台湾应该予以中立化”，而且故意捏造出所谓“台湾未来问题”来，用第七舰队的干涉来造成长期占领的事实，就是“建立日本与世界其他地方的清楚的未来关系”，把日本军国主义的势力扶植起来，加强对中国的威胁。就是对于台湾蒋介石匪帮“给予一切可能的帮助”，继续与中国人民为敌。他为了要对苏联和中华人民共和国进行恶意的诽谤，而找不到间隙，甚至下流无耻到把过去早就自己打过嘴巴的谣言重提一番，说是“新疆、外蒙古（？）和满洲目前只是在名义上是中国的”。他公然撕毁了开罗宣言，就这只是“在将来的解决时应该考虑到的一个重要因素”。他甚而至于明白表示要使亚洲人民不分国别”变得像菲律宾一样。大家知道，菲律宾就是美国帝国主义所控制的一个可怜的殖民地。战争贩子的这种狂谬言论，对于中国人民和全亚洲人民可以说是极尽侮辱的能事了。
    在这美国两大战争贩子的无耻狂吠中，在安理会美国代表的无耻强辩中，我们已经看清了美国帝国主义者怙恶不悛的狰狞面目。我们四万七千五百万中国人民是有充分的力量和决心保卫祖国神圣的领土和主权的。我们不怕血腥的战争贩子的虚声恫吓。我们要在世界和平阵营的前列加紧努力，为制止战争贩子们准备新的世界侵略战争的罪行而继续斗争。最后的胜利一定是属于我们的。
