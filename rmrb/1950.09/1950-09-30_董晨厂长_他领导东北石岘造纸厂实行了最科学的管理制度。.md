Director Dong Chen
    He leads the Northeast Shixian Paper Mill to implement the most scientific management system.
    Dong Chen is the director of the Northeast Shixian Paper Mill. He studied the advanced Soviet management and production experience, researched new management methods, and, on the basis of the old, proposed the method of managing production with charts as the link of the entire management method, so that the entire picture of production was completely renewed. In terms of output, the production of sulfite pulp has exceeded the highest standard of the puppet Manchukuo by more than 35 percent, and the output of newsprint has more than doubled the highest standard of the puppet Manchukuo. In terms of quality, more than 95 percent of first-class and special-class products are guaranteed. And continuously reduced costs.
  Resolutely Overcome Difficulties and Create Favorable Conditions
    The technical equipment conditions of the Shixian Paper Mill are not good: the factory has a history of thirteen years, the destruction of the war, the difficulty of supplying foreign goods, many machines were pieced together, and some machines, such as No. 2 machine, are more than sixty years old. Shixian is also a remote valley, the technical level of workers is not high, more than 15 percent are apprentices, and old technical workers account for only about 23 percent. The organizational structure of the entire factory is very chaotic.
    Comrade Dong Chen did not bow to difficulties. In May last year, he first started by changing the old organizational structure and strengthening workshop leadership. He abolished the past organizational structure of sections, units, and classes, and boldly proposed a one-chief workshop management system based on the existing laws of the process: the factory director directly led the workshop, the workshop was equipped with a director, who directly led the foreman, and organized production. He also dispatched personnel to the workshop to help with the work, so that the workshop director could concentrate on leading and completing the production plan. Set quotas and revise quotas through the masses; implemented various specialized responsibility systems; and on the basis of further development of the New Record Movement, changed the past thirteen-grade and thirty-nine-level wage system to a seven-level wage system, and implemented piecework, time-based overtime reward methods.
    This laid the foundation for the implementation of the production instruction chart this year.
  Advocate the Implementation of Production Instruction Charts
    The production process of Shixian Paper Mill is quite complicated, especially the manufacture of sulfite wood pulp, which requires 82 hours and six processing steps from the input of raw materials to the machine. If any production unit is disconnected, it will affect the completion of the production task.
    Comrade Dong Chen studied these actual situations and learned from the experience of the Soviet Union in managing enterprises. He decided to try the scientific chart system and explained to everyone the intention and requirements of implementing the chart system, and pointed out clear methods and steps.
    The production chart system uses charts to indicate the output, quality, and plan completion of various departments and even individuals, which is an easy-to-understand chart for the masses. It conforms to the natural laws of the production system, integrates the overall production plan and management system, and organizes various production processes, making various departments and individuals a link in the overall management of production. The 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out that the production plans of all enterprises must be implemented on the basis of detailed production charts. Director Dong Chen has achieved concrete results since he began to promote this advanced management method in January of this year.
  Departed from the handicraft management methods
    The comment made by Soviet expert Sergei Kefu on the management method of Shixian Paper Mill is: "Basically, it has departed from the handicraft management method and embarked on the enterprise management method."
    The production chart clearly indicates the task, so that anyone in the factory has clear responsibilities at any time. With the rise of production, the workers themselves experienced the necessity of implementing a reasonable distribution of wages, thus requiring study and requesting job assessment, which facilitated the implementation of the current eight-level wage system. The application of production charts combines technical personnel with production and technical management. For example, among the current twelve workshop directors and deputy directors, five are technical personnel, and among the eight section-level technical management cadres, technical personnel account for five. The technical personnel participating in workshop production account for 78 percent of the total, achieving that they have both positions and powers, and at the same time changed the nature of the New Record Movement, so that 56 percent of the New Records that originally belonged to the improvement of labor intensity became 70 percent belonging to technological improvement in June. In the production instruction chart, the weakest link in the production process can be found, thus pointing out the direction of development, and then the focus is on breaking through this weakness. The development of new records also shifts with the weak links in production. The Shixian Factory first tried to improve the pharmaceutical department, the weakest link in the sulfite system, from a daily output of 288 cubic meters to 307 cubic meters and finally to 329 cubic meters. After the problem of the pharmaceutical solution was solved, the weakness shifted to the wood pot, which shortened the cooking time and increased the amount of pot release. As a result, fine selection became an obstacle to the wood pot release, so the fine selection capacity was improved, and the output of the pump was also increased. A series of organized improvements created a series of new records (46 new records have been created in the past six months, worth 16.7 billion Northeast currency).
    In addition, in the process of implementing the management method of production charts, the quotas were improved twice. Workers follow standard work methods to operate, ensure quality, and improve the loss situation in various workshops. The inspection system ensures the safe operation of the machinery, and carries out planned prior inspections and repairs, giving full play to the maximum performance of the machinery. For example, the wood pot has exerted its maximum performance, and the amount of pot release per unit of effective volume has gradually increased to reach the Soviet standard.
    The production chart is like a vein, combining the laws and management methods of the entire factory's activities, making the content of these laws and activities more substantial and vivid. These achievements are also the result of Comrade Dong Chen's dedicated research, uniting all employees, and promoting new management methods.

　　董晨厂长
    他领导东北石岘造纸厂实行了最科学的管理制度。
    董晨是东北石岘造纸厂厂长，他学习了苏联先进管理生产经验，研究新的管理方法，在旧有的基础上提出了以图表管理生产的方法做为整个管理方法的纽带，从而使生产全貌为之一新。在产量上，亚硫酸纸浆较伪满最高标准已超过百分之三十五，新闻纸的产量超过伪满最高标准一倍。质量方面，保证了百分之九十五以上的一等品和特等品。并不断减低了成本。
  坚决克服困难，创造有利条件
    石岘纸厂的技术设备条件并不好：厂子有十三年的历史，战争的破坏，外货供应的困难，许多机器东凑西拼，有的机器如二号机已有六十多年的历史。石岘又是一个偏僻的山谷，工人的技术水平不高，百分之十五以上是学徒，老技术工人只占百分之二十三左右。全厂组织机构非常混乱。
    董晨同志没有向困难低头。去年五月间，他首先从改变旧的组织机构，加强车间领导下手。他取消了过去科、股、班的组织机构，大胆以工艺过程的现有规律，提出以一长制的车间管理制度：厂长直接领导车间，车间设主任，直接领导工长，组织生产。他又派遣人员到车间帮助工作，使车间主任专心来领导和完成生产计划。通过群众制定定额，修正定额；实行了各种专责制；在新纪录运动进一步开展的基础上，把过去十三等三十九级的工资制度，改为七级工资制，并实行计件、计时超额奖励办法。
    这就给今年实行生产指示图打下了基础。
  提倡实行生产指示图
    石岘造纸厂生产过程相当复杂，特别是像制造亚硫酸的木浆由原料投入机器，需要经过八十二小时，六个加工工艺过程，其中只要有某一生产单位脱节，就会影响生产任务的完成。
    董晨同志研究了这些实际情况，学习苏联管理企业的经验，他决定试行科学的图表制，并向大家说明实行图表制的意图和要求，指出明确的方法和步骤。
    生产图表制就是用图表标示出各个部门甚至个人的产量、质量及计划完成的情形，是容易使群众了解的图表。它是顺应生产体系的自然规律，溶合了总的生产计划、管理制度，组织了各种生产过程，各部门、各人成为一个整体的管理生产的纽带。联共（布）第十八次代表会议指出：各企业的生产计划必须在详细编制的生产图表的基础上执行。董晨厂长自本年一月开始推行这一先进的管理方法，已得到了具体的成绩。
  脱离了手工业的管理方法
    苏联专家谢尔吉克夫对石岘纸厂的管理方法所下的评语是：“在基本上已脱离了手工业的管理方法，走上企业化管理方法。”
    生产图表明确指示任务，使工厂任何人在任何时间都有了明确的职责。随着生产的高涨，工人自身体验到有实行工资合理分配的必要，从而要求学习，要求考工，便利了现在八级工资制的推行。生产图表的运用使技术人员和生产结合，和技术管理工作结合。例如在现在十二名车间正副主任中有五名是技术人员，在八名科级技术管理干部中，技术人员占有五名。参加车间生产的技术人员占总数百分之七十八，作到了有职有权，同时改变了新纪录的性质，使百分之五十六原属于提高劳动强度的新纪录到六月一变而为有百分之七十是属于技术改进。在生产指示图中可以发现生产过程中最弱的环节，这样就指出了发展的方向，于是就先全力突破这一弱点。新纪录的发展也就随生产中薄弱环节而转移。石岘厂就是先设法提高亚硫酸系统中最弱一环的制药部门，使他由日产二八八立方米提高到三○七立方米而最后达到三二九立方米。在药液问题解决后弱点又转移到木釜，又使木釜缩短了蒸煮时间，同时加大放锅量。随着而来的，精选成为木釜放锅的障碍，因此，又把精选能力提高，抄泵机产量也提高。一连串有组织的改进，创造了一连串的新纪录（半年来创造新纪录四十六件，价值东北币一百六十七亿）。
    此外，在执行生产图表的管理方法过程中，又改进了两次定额。工人遵循标准工作法操作，保证了质量，改善了各车间的流失情况。在检查制度上保证了机械安全运转，并在有计划的进行事先的检查与修理，发挥了机械最大的性能。如木釜发挥了最大性能，每单位有效容积的放锅量日渐提高达到苏联标准。
    生产图表好似一根筋络，把整个工厂的全部活动的规律与管理方法结合在一起，使这规律与活动的内容更加充实与生动。这些成绩也就是董晨同志的潜心研究，团结全体职工，推行新管理方法的收获。
