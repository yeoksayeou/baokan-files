　　New Transformation, New Beginning!
    ——Transformation of Production Leadership in Pingyuan Province
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper  Zhou Ziqin
    I. The Situation Before the Transformation
    The production work in Pingyuan Province has started a new transformation after the Party Representative Conference of the province in February this year. Many cadres in various regions have freed themselves from the past state of distress and feel that they have methods and hope for production.
    After the first Party Representative Conference of the province last year, although the policy of focusing on production to conclude the land reform was announced, the guiding ideology was not clear on the direction of developing production, and the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was not well implemented. The idea of emphasizing land reform and neglecting production leadership was very common both inside and outside the Party. The phenomenon of violating policies in a few areas was not stopped in time, and bureaucracy and commandism were still very serious. In old and semi-old areas where land had been largely equally distributed, cadres still abandoned production and engaged in the work of concluding land reform, which caused unrest among the masses. As a result, the masses were suspicious, the cadres were distressed, and the work lacked direction. The following phenomena were common among the masses and cadres:
    Agricultural socialist ideas and concerns about developing production were common among the masses. They believed that "poverty is glorious," feared standing out, and feared rising to become rich peasants. Landlords adopted the attitude of "drinking and eating everything up," while middle peasants feared that "after picking the big pumpkins (landlords), they would pick the small pumpkins (middle peasants)." Bad elements took the opportunity to create various rumors. The masses' thinking was very unstable, and the idea that "labor does not lead to wealth, and production does not lead to thrift" was widespread, greatly hindering the recovery and development of production.
    Cadres were in a state of passive depression and even lay down and did not work. In Anyang Prefecture, more than 150 cadres had laid down since last year. In Yanggu County, one-sixth of the cadres requested to go home or lay down. In two districts of Tangyi and Gaotang counties, one-half of the cadres requested to go home. According to a responsible comrade of the Agricultural Department, in general counties and districts, less than half of the cadres are regularly working in each district. The idea that "production does not need leadership" was common among cadres. Some cadres believed that production could not be led. District cadres often slept during the day and held meetings at night to report materials.
    Why were the cadres distressed? The main reasons were: First, the reorganization of institutions this year had a great impact on the thinking of cadres. This year, the province had more than 8,000 surplus worker-peasant cadres, all of whom had been tempered by guerrilla warfare and land reform. Before the reorganization, there was no adequate political mobilization, and after the reorganization, they were not properly handled and placed. After these cadres returned home, they left a very bad impression among the masses and the cadres in office. The cadres in office (old worker-peasant cadres) believed that "worker-peasant cadres are not popular and will eventually have to go home." This caused anxiety, pessimism, and depression.
    Second, the growth of meritorious service thinking and hedonistic thinking among cadres. They believed that the revolution had been victorious and that it was time to take a breather; whether production was led or not, farmers would still farm. Some considered themselves meritorious and did not think of ways to improve their work. Their thinking began to become corrupt, they talked about enjoyment, and demanded status. They lost their enthusiasm for work.
    Third, cadres believed that production could not be led, lacked methods for leading production, and the road of work became narrower and narrower. The methods they were familiar with in the past could no longer be used, and they did not have new methods. Coercion and commandism did not work. The tasks were heavy, and if they were not completed, they would be criticized. The leadership only demanded the completion of tasks and did not help the lower-level cadres solve the difficulties in detail. This made the lower-level cadres feel heavy pressure and had no way to go.
    The fundamental reason why production work could not be promoted after the first Party Representative Conference of Pingyuan Province was that agricultural socialist ideas existed among the masses, cadres did not have a clear understanding of the policy of developing production, lacked a mass perspective, and felt helpless. The county and prefecture leaders had bureaucratic and empiricist ideas and failed to solve these problems in time, which made production work unable to be promoted.
    II. How was the Production Situation Opened Up?
    One of the biggest gains of the Second Party Representative Conference of Pingyuan Province this year was that it systematically solved the agricultural socialist ideas among the masses, implemented the Party's various policies, stabilized the production mood, and dispelled concerns about production and getting rich. Among the cadres, the idea that production did not need leadership was solved, and it was affirmed that production must be led. But then the question of "how to lead production" arose. Therefore, how to lead production became the key to opening the door to production. From the perspective of Anyang, Liaocheng, Puyang, and Xinxiang prefectures in Pingyuan Province, the cadres were more enthusiastic and there were fewer phenomena of depression where this issue was well resolved; the cadres were less enthusiastic and the work lost direction, and the phenomena of depression among cadres were very serious where this issue was not well resolved. However, to solve the problem of how to lead production, it is necessary to change the leadership style and overcome the bureaucratic and empiricist ideas in the leadership. Conscientiously help lower-level cadres, think of ways, offer ideas, and solve the difficulties that arise in the work. Help lower-level cadres discover typical examples, summarize experiences, and concentrate the creation and experience of the masses to guide the masses. Timely enrich the leadership from summarizing the work. This requires strengthening the education of the mass perspective and mass line from top to bottom. Discuss matters with the masses more often. Must provide specific assistance to lower-level cadres to solve the idea that production cannot be led. Learn the methods of leading production, and establish a mass line and mass perspective that faces the masses and seriously learns from the masses.
    How did Anyang, Liaocheng, Puyang and other regions specifically do it? After the second Party Representative Conference, these places generally used forms such as Party representative conferences at all levels, representative conferences of all sectors, and people's representative conferences to universally discuss and implement production policies from the county to the village. They criticized and handled some phenomena of violating laws and disciplines, and commended a group of relatively good Party members, branches, and cadres. Taking the Liaocheng Prefectural Committee as an example, in the past six months, it has commended more than 100 Party members, dozens of branches, and handled more than 200 Party members who violated policies, demarcated the line between right and wrong, and leaders at all levels have universally conducted self-criticism and inspection, which has achieved great results.
    First, change the work style of cadres, advocate facing the masses, and oppose bureaucracy. The Lin County Party Committee informed all districts of the three-comparison movement of the County's Seventh District Committee (comparing policies, work styles, and achievements) and the mass line work style of Li Gui, the district chief of the district, for discussion, and universally launched the three-comparison movement. As a result, the leadership style of cadres has undergone significant changes. Li Gui of the Seventh District often went to the fields to find various crops as specimens, went to civil schools to teach the masses how to select seeds, and took a sprayer to teach the masses how to control aphids. Under his influence, the masses brought back some seedlings as specimens from the fields every day, comparing and studying each other to see whose crops were better. This method greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses. Cooperative cadres also went to the countryside with the daily necessities of the farmers, which was welcomed by the masses.
    Second, resolutely implement the Party's various production policies and wage a resolute struggle against various phenomena of violating policies. From the in-depth publicity of production policies, promote democracy, mobilize the masses to supervise the leadership, and supervise Party members and cadres. Leading cadres at all levels have universally conducted self-criticism on past mistakes of violating policies and deviating from the masses, which has played a great role in changing the bureaucratic work style. In this way, the production enthusiasm of the masses has been improved, and Party members and cadres have begun to grasp the production policies. Ren Jiafa, a Party member of Shijiazhuang in the Third District of Lin County, and Wang Laicheng, a member of the branch committee, etc., encroached on the small cypress trees of the masses. After being reported by the Discipline Inspection Committee, in addition to being given separate punishment inside and outside the Party, they also admitted their mistakes at the mass meeting and notified the entire county to educate all Party members and cadres. A Party member in Caojiagou was punished for beating the masses and admitted his mistakes in public. This greatly improved the Party's prestige among the masses. In order to correct the phenomenon of unequal and unbeneficial mutual assistance, the Seventh District of Lin County also conducted an inspection of the mutual aid groups before the summer harvest and summer planting, and corrected those who violated the spirit of voluntary mutual benefit. At the same time, it also discovered many villages and good mutual aid groups that implemented the policies well. The masses in Liaocheng Prefecture wrote many letters, some to the prefectural committee and some to Chairman Mao, all of which were handed over to the Discipline Inspection Committee or the leading organs to assign special personnel to be responsible for investigation and handling. Some of the masses also directly talked to the prefectural committee, and these issues were given attention.
    Third, use living typical examples to educate cadres and the masses. Lin County absorbed various labor models to participate in the representative conferences of all sectors, and they made typical reports and discussed the work of summer harvest, summer planting, pest control, field seed selection, seed soaking, and mutual assistance. When the Eighth District held a representative conference, the place for the meeting was selected in the village with the best production in the entire district. After the representatives arrived, they first visited the crops, livestock, oil mills, cooperatives, etc. in the fields, and introduced the process of the village's production and wealth. At the representative conference of the Eleventh District, the benefits of seed soaking were publicized by comparing two kinds of wheat, one soaked and one not soaked. Due to the adoption of typical experiences reported by hero models, actual visits, comparisons of crops, labor, and technology, the production policies were implemented.
    Fourth, improve the leadership ability of cadres and strengthen policy and ideological education. One is to conduct cadre appraisal through planned and conscious summary of work after each stage of work. See which ones are done right and which ones are done wrong, and make a note on the appraisal form. This is of great benefit to restoring the morale of cadres and improving their work enthusiasm. Another is to systematically train cadres. The counties in Liaocheng Prefecture have adopted the method of training Party members in pieces, which has been very effective. These Party members who have been trained generally understand the Party's production policies, have learned some methods for leading production, and their enthusiasm has been improved after returning.
    Fifth, strengthen technical leadership and pay attention to establishing and improving specialized organizations for leading production and mastering economic departments. Wherever this is done, the work is good. For example, in Xinxian County, Liaocheng Prefecture, more than 180 of the 300 administrative villages have established technical research committees. When each production task comes, the technical research committee is first asked to study it. For example, weeding wheat and selecting seeds are all studied by the technical research committee, which proposes the benefits and how to weed, and submits it to the village people's congress for discussion. After the resolution is made, each representative goes back to convey, publicize, mobilize the masses, and implement the resolution. Counties such as Anyang have generally established small "farms" for experimental seed soaking, which shows that after the masses' enthusiasm for production has been improved, they actively demand to improve technology and increase production. Lin County is currently adopting the method of field training classes to conduct technical training on a large scale. It is required that in a very short period of time, the broad masses learn the techniques of hoeing seedlings and managing cotton. The county plans to train 100,000 people to learn the techniques of hoeing seedlings and managing cotton and pest control in a short period of time through this movement. The method is to first study by the technical committee, and then absorb 20 to 30 young people and women to go to the fields to teach them practically how to hoe and manage cotton, doing it while teaching it. Then, through them, go back to teach the mutual aid group or their family members. You can learn in the morning and teach others in the afternoon. This method can be promoted in areas with a solid foundation for work. Counties in Liaocheng Prefecture also use county people's congresses or district representative conferences to display excellent varieties, new agricultural tools, and pest control methods. Xinxian also publicized and promoted excellent varieties and held exhibitions of physical objects in pieces at the People's Congress to improve technology.
    Since the Second Party Congress in Pingyuan Province, it has made considerable achievements in grasping policies, strengthening leadership, changing work styles, and improving and improving technology, in removing ideological concerns of the masses and cadres' production leadership ideas. However, it is not yet universal, it is only the beginning. In most areas and cadres, production leadership has not been completely resolved, and the state of drifting is still very serious. There are still phenomena of formalism (such as some small farms) and coercion and commandism (such as in some villages in production competitions that are not voluntary by the masses). At present, production work has achieved certain achievements and creations, but it is not solid or in-depth. Leaders at all levels are not clear about the direction of organizing and getting rich in production, and they must work harder to improve in the future.

　　新的转变，新的开始！
    ——平原省生产领导的转变
    本报特派记者  周子芹
    一、转变以前的情况
    平原省的生产工作，在今年二月该省党代表会议后，已开始了一个新的转变。不少地区的干部，已从过去的苦闷状态中摆脱出来，感到对生产有了办法，有了希望。
    去年该省第一次党代表会议后，虽已宣布了以生产为中心进行结束土改的方针，但由于领导思想对发展生产的方针不明确，对中共中央二中全会决议的精神未能很好贯彻；党内外重土改，轻视领导生产的思想非常普遍，对少数地区发生违犯政策的现象，未能及时制止，官僚主义，命令主义还很严重。在土地已经大体平分的老区、半老区，干部仍丢开生产，搞结束土改工作，结果引起群众情绪动荡不安。以致群众怀疑，干部苦闷，工作没有方向。在群众和干部中普遍存在着这样的现象：
    在群众中普遍存在着农业社会主义的思想和对发展生产有顾虑。认为“穷光荣”，怕冒尖，怕上升为富农；地主则抱着“喝光吃净”的态度，中农怕“摘了大南瓜（地主）再摘小南瓜（中农）”；坏分子乘机制造各种谣言。群众思想极不安定，普遍存在“劳动不致富，生产不节约”的思想，大大障碍了生产的恢复和发展。
    干部中存在消极苦闷情绪，甚至躺倒不工作。安阳专区从去年以来，就有一百五十多个干部躺倒；阳谷县干部要求回家及躺倒者达六分之一；唐邑、高堂两县的两个区，要求回家者达二分之一。据农业厅一负责同志谈：目前一般县区中，每个区经常作工作的干部，不足二分之一。干部中普遍存在着“生产不用领导”的思想。有的干部则认为生产没法领导。区干部多是白天睡觉，晚上开会要汇报材料。
    为什么干部苦闷呢？主要的原因是：第一、今年整编机构，对干部思想上的震动是很大的。今年全省编余工农干部八千多人，这些干部都是经过了游击战争和土地改革的锻炼的。在整编前既未经过充分的政治动员，整编后又未给以妥善处理和安置。这些干部回家后，在群众中和在职干部中，留下了很坏的印象。在职干部中（工农老干部）认为“工农干部吃不开，早晚脱不了回家”。因此造成情绪不安，消沉，苦闷。
    第二、是干部中功臣思想，享乐思想的滋长。认为革命已经胜利，该松一口气；生产领导不领导，农民一样会种地。有的以功臣自居，不想办法改进工作。思想开始腐化，讲享受，要求地位。对工作失去热情。
    第三、干部中存在生产无法领导的思想，缺少领导生产的办法，工作的道路越走越窄。过去熟悉的办法现在用不上了，新的办法又没有。强迫命令吃不开。任务重，完不成就要受批评。领导上光要求完成任务，不帮助下级干部具体解决困难。使下面干部感到压力重，无路可走。
    平原省第一次党代表会后，生产工作推不动的根本原因是群众中存在农业社会主义思想，干部对发展生产的政策认识不明确，又缺乏群众观点，感到没办法，而县、专区领导上存在官僚主义与经验主义，未能及时解决这些问题，致使生产工作陷于无法推动的状态。
    二、生产局面是怎样打开的？
    今年二月平原省第二次党代表会议的最大收获之一，是比较系统的解决了群众中的农业社会主义思想，贯彻了党的各种政策，安定了生产情绪，解除了对生产发家的顾虑。在干部中，则解决了生产不用领导的思想，肯定了生产必须领导。但接着就发生了“生产如何领导”的问题。因而如何领导生产，就成了打开生产大门的关键。从平原省的安阳、聊城、濮阳、新乡等专区来看，那里对这个问题解决得好，那里的干部情绪就高，苦闷的现象就少；那里对这个问题解决不好，那里的干部情绪就不高，工作迷失方向，干部苦闷的现象就很严重。但要解决如何领导生产这个问题，主要是转变领导作风，克服领导上的官僚主义和经验主义的思想。认真的帮助下级干部，想办法，出主意，解决工作中发生的困难。帮助下级干部发现典型，总结经验，集中群众的创造和经验以指导群众。及时从总结工作中，来丰富领导。这就必须从上到下，加强群众观点和群众路线的教育。有事多和群众商量。对下级干部必须具体帮助，解决生产无法领导的思想。学习领导生产的方法，建立面向群众，认真向群众学习的群众路线、群众观点。
    安阳、聊城、濮阳等几个地区是怎样具体作的呢？这些地方在二次党代表会议之后，一般都是通过了各级党代表会议、各界代表会议、人民代表会等几种形式，由县到村，普遍讨论和贯彻生产政策。批评和处理了一些违法犯纪的现象，表扬了一批比较好的党员、支部、干部。如以聊城地委为例，半年以来，表扬了一百多个党员，几十个支部，处理了二百多个违犯政策的党员，划清了是非界线，各级领导普遍的进行了自我批评和检查，收到了很大的成绩。
    一、首先是转变干部作风，提倡面向群众，反对官僚主义。林县县委以该县七区区委会的比政策、比作风、比成绩的三比运动，和该区区长李贵同志的群众路线作风，通报各区组织讨论，普遍展开三比运动。因而使干部的领导作风，有了显著的转变。七区李贵同志经常到地里去，找各种庄稼做标本，到民校给群众讲选种方法，带上喷雾器教群众治蚜虫，在他的影响下，群众每天都从地里带回些禾苗作标本，互相比较、研究，看谁的庄稼好。这种办法，对群众生产情绪鼓励很大。合作社干部也带着农民生活必需品下乡，得到群众的欢迎。
    二、坚决贯彻党的各种生产政策；和各种违犯政策的现象，展开坚决的斗争。从深入宣传生产政策上，发扬民主，发动群众监督领导，监督党员和干部。对过去违犯政策，脱离群众的错误，各级领导干部都普遍的作了自我批评，对改变官僚主义作风，作用很大。这样，群众的生产积极性提高了，党员干部开始掌握了生产政策。林县三区石家庄党员任加法和支部委员王来成等，侵占群众小柏树，经纪律检查委员会检举，除党内外分别予以处分外，并在群众大会上承认错误，同时通报全县教育全体党员干部。曹家沟党员吊打群众，也受到处分，并当众承认错误。这就使党在群众中的威信大大提高。为了纠正互助中不等价不两利的现象，林县七区在夏收夏种前又进行了对互助组的检查，对违犯自愿两利精神的，则予以纠正。同时也发现了许多执行政策好的村庄，和好的互助组。聊城专区群众写了许多信，有些是写给地委的，有的写给毛主席，都交由纪律委员会或领导机关派专人负责调查处理。也有些群众直接找地委谈，这些问题都得到重视。
    三、运用活的典型，教育干部和群众。林县在各界代表会上，吸收了各种劳动模范参加，由他们作典型报告，讨论了夏收、夏种、除虫、田间选种、浸种、互助等工作。八区开代表会时，把开会的地方选择在全区生产最好的村子，代表到后，先到地里参观庄稼、牲口、油房、合作社等，并介绍该村生产致富的经过。十一区在各界代表会上，用浸种和不浸种的两种麦子作比较，宣传浸种的好处。由于采用了由英雄模范报告典型经验，进行实际参观，展开了比庄稼、比劳动、比技术，贯彻了生产政策。
    四、提高干部的领导能力，加强政策思想教育。一种是在每段工作过去以后，通过有计划有意识的总结工作，作干部鉴定。看看那些作对了，那些作错了，并在鉴定表上作个记号。这对恢复干部情绪，提高工作积极性上，有很大好处。另一种是有计划的训练干部。聊城专区各县采用片村训练党员的办法，收效很大。这些经过训练以后的党员，一般都了解了党的生产政策，学到了一些领导生产的办法，回去后积极性都提高了。
    五、加强技术领导，注意建立和改进领导生产的专门组织，掌握经济部门。凡这样做了的地方，工作就好。如聊城专区莘县三百多行政村，已有一百八十个村建立了技术研究委员会，每个生产任务到来时，先叫技术研究委员会研究，如锄麦、选种，都由技术研究委员会研究后，提出好处在那里，如何锄法等，提交村人代会上讨论，作出决议后，各代表分头回去传达，宣传动员群众，贯彻决议。安阳等县则普遍建立了试验浸种的小型“农场”，都表现出群众在生产热情提高后，积极要求改进技术，增加生产。林县目前正采用田间训练班的办法，普遍大量的进行技术训练。要求在很短时间内，使广大群众学会锄苗和管理棉花技术。该县计划经过这一运动，短期内训练十万群众学会锄苗和管理棉花、除虫等技术。其办法先由技术委员会研究后，吸收二三十个青年、妇女，到田间去，实地教他们如何锄地和管理棉花，一边做，一边教。然后通过他们回去，教互助组的或自己的家里人。上午学会，下午就可教给别人。这个办法在工作有基础地区，是可以推广的。聊城专区各县，也有利用县人民代表会或区代表会上，展览优良品种，新式农具，除虫等办法。莘县并在人代会上，宣传推广优良品种，举行片村实物展览，提高技术。
    平原省在二次党代会以来，在掌握政策，加强领导，转变作风，提高与改良技术等方面，在解除群众思想顾虑和干部生产领导思想上，都有相当成绩。但是还不普遍，还只是开始。在大部分地区和干部中，生产领导还未完全解决，自流状态还很严重。还有形式主义（如有部分小农场）和强迫命令（如生产竞赛中某些村不是群众自愿）的现象存在。目前生产工作已有了某些成绩和创造，但还不巩固，不深入。各级领导对组织起来，生产发家的方向不明确，还须今后更加努力改进。
