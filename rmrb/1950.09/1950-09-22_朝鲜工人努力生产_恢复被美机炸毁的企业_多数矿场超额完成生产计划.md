　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st: According to TASS, the working people of Korea are working selflessly, restoring enterprises destroyed by the frenzied bombing of U.S. aircraft as quickly as possible, and striving to increase production to support the front lines. The workers of a certain iron mine have exceeded the two-year plan by 102.3 percent before the scheduled time. In another mine, youth work teams worked hard as if they were fighting in a charge, greatly exceeding their targets. For example, the Jin Shengyin (transliteration) team exceeded the August plan by 170 percent; the Li Yongyu (transliteration) team exceeded it by 231 percent.
　　Workers in three textile factories completed their two-year plan on September 15.
