    《School》
    By Gaidar, Translated by Ye Zhimei, Published by Xinhua Bookstore
    The Soviet Union has many literary works written for children that use the actual lives they encounter to reflect the general situation of society in a concrete and vivid way. These works are popular mainly because the images they depict are real and appear vividly before us. Gaidar's novels are even more representative of these works. Therefore, they are universally loved by children and even adults.

    Gaidar's autobiographical novel, "School," describes the actual situation of Russian society before and after the revolution through the story of a primary school student participating in the revolution, and focuses on how this child was tempered and strengthened in the revolutionary ranks. This child, Bourgeois, is not from a proletariat background like Paul Kochakin in "How Steel Was Tempered." He is a child who grew up in a family that was neither poor nor too rich. His father was a revolutionary and was shot by the Tsar. The environment influenced him to participate in the revolution. He also had a great passion for the revolution, but at the same time, he also carried petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness, which caused him to make many serious mistakes in the revolutionary ranks. However, under the education of the Party, he gradually realized himself and was tempered into a true revolutionary fighter. Bourgeois's situation is similar to the situation of many intellectual youths participating in the revolution: some people think that the revolution is just some sensational scenes. Bourgeois could not recognize the objective conditions for a period of time, thinking that as long as the guerrillas avoided contact with the enemy's main force, it was cowardice; after he was captured by the enemy, he also fantasized about shouting "Long live the revolution" and sacrificing himself heroically, instead of rationally solving practical problems. Some of us are unwilling to be bound by discipline. It was because of this that Bourgeois made mistakes one after another, causing the revolution to suffer losses that could have been avoided. These are very realistic for us, and we can learn lessons from them.

    Of course, Bourgeois made mistakes not because he was bad in nature. He was just a fourteen or fifteen-year-old child, naive and innocent. He had not yet cultivated any class hatred in himself. The author's portrayal of such a child's psychology is very profound and moving. Bourgeois made many mistakes, but did not arouse the reader's disgust. On the contrary, he only hoped that he would realize his mistakes and correct them as soon as possible. Bourgeois finally had a new understanding of the revolution, so he joined the Party. He had the same hatred for class enemies as those fighters from working-class backgrounds. The improvement of political consciousness makes us believe that although Bourgeois was injured in the end, his future path will be to dedicate everything to the revolution and to the establishment of a better society. Gaidar's fighting life clearly tells us what kind of person Bourgeois has become and will become. This book is worth reading for the teenagers and youths of New China.

    《学校》
    盖达尔著  叶至美译  新华书店发行
    苏联有许多给孩子们写的文艺作品，用他们所接触的实际生活，具体而生动地反映了社会的一般情况。这些作品受到欢迎，主要因为它们所描写的形象是真实的，并且活生生地出现在我们面前。盖达尔的小说，更突出地代表着这些作品。所以，普遍地被孩子们以至成人们所热爱着。
    盖达尔的一部自传体小说—《学校》，就通过了一个小学生参加革命的故事，描写了俄国革命前后社会的实际情况，并且着重地写出了这个孩子怎样在革命的队伍里锻炼得坚强。这个孩子—布尔里史，并不像《钢铁是怎样炼成的》一书中的保尔·柯察金那样的无产阶级出身，他是在一个既不穷而又不太富的家庭里长大的孩子，父亲是革命者，被沙皇枪决了，环境影响他参加了革命。他对革命也抱着满腔热情，同时却也带上了小资产阶级的思想意识，这使他在革命队伍里犯了许多严重错误，然而在党的教育下，他渐渐地认识了自己，锻炼成了一个真正的革命战士。布尔里史的情形，和我们许多知识分子青年参加革命的情形相似：有人以为革命只是一些轰轰烈烈的场面，布尔里史就有一段时间不能认识客观的条件，以为只要游击队避免和敌人主力接触，就是胆怯；当他给敌人捉住之后，也曾经幻想要高呼“革命万岁”，慷慨就义，而不想理智地解决实际问题。我们有些人不愿受纪律的约束，布尔里史就因为这样，才接二连三地犯了错误，使革命遭到本来可以避免的损失。这些，对我们说来，都是非常现实的，我们能在这里面得到教训。
    当然，布尔里史所以犯错误，并不因为他本质上是坏的，他还只是一个十四五岁的小孩子，天真、幼稚，在他身上还没有培植起什么阶级仇恨。作者刻划这样一个儿童的心理是非常深刻和动人的。布尔里史犯了许多错误，并没有激起读者对他的反感，相反的只希望着他快一点认识自己的错误去改正它。布尔里史最后对革命有了新的认识，他于是入了党，他有了和那些工人阶级出身的战士们同样的对阶级敌人的仇恨心。政治觉悟的提高，使我们相信，布尔里史在最后虽然负了伤，但他以后的路子，是会为了革命，为了建立一个美好的社会而贡献出自己的一切的。盖达尔战斗的一生，很显然地告诉了我们布尔里史已经和以后要成为怎样一个的人了。这本书是值得新中国的少年们、青年们一读的。（本书三联书店最近有另一译本出版——编者）
