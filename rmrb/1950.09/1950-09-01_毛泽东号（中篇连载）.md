　　Mao Zedong Locomotive (Medium-Length Serial)
　　(By Ding Kexin and Qingying)
　　　　　　Eleven, Awarded the "Locomotive Leader" Prize
　　Back at the section, the old hero thought about going to Zheng Dugong to reason with him.
　　But then he thought: I am the driver chief; Representative Song also said that as a cadre, one must be able to "hold a boat in one's stomach" and not be petty.
　　After thinking it over, he swallowed his anger.
　　The old hero had this good quality: no matter what unpleasant things he encountered, as long as he saw others caring about their work and working hard, he would be happy. When Zhang Chuanzhong came to talk to him about the oil issue, he forgot his "grievance."
　　Zhang Chuanzhong said: The light oil is too thin, and the oil splashes out as soon as the wheels turn. Using heavy oil, it won't drip into the oil pipe. Cylinder oil is the best, but cylinder oil is too expensive and too scarce. What should we do?
　　"I noticed this a long time ago... Can't we find a way to solve it ourselves?"
　　"But you, the driver chief, have to lead us."
　　The old hero decided to lead everyone in research, mixing heavy oil, light oil, and axle oil together and boiling them into a mixed oil.
　　After a test, it was not only effective but also saved resources:
　　From Harbin to Yimianpo, one hundred and sixty-two kilometers, previously light oil used five catties, now mixed oil is enough with three catties.
　　New creation, good method, the leadership promoted it, and the entire section praised the "Mao Zedong Locomotive."
　　Saving coal, saving oil, protecting the locomotive, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" are all models.
　　Running the locomotive is also exceptionally well-handled!
　　There have been no accidents, and each month the safe mileage exceeds five thousand kilometers (at that time, general locomotives could only run three to four thousand kilometers per month).
　　In October, during the merit evaluation, it was rated as a first-class meritorious group and received a prize banner with four big characters written on it:
　　"Locomotive Leader."
　　　　　　Twelve, Responding to the Call
　　Winter came, and the Northeast People's Liberation Army was fighting the enemy in the south of the Yangtze River for the third time. The rear support for the front line work was even more intensified.
　　To save manpower and materials, the locomotive's three-shift system was reduced to two shifts, and Zhang Chuanzhong and three others were transferred away from the "Mao Zedong Locomotive."
　　Just then, the "Zhu De Locomotive" was ordered to be extinguished and put into storage.
　　Representative Song of the locomotive depot was also being transferred away. Fearing that everyone's competitive spirit would be affected, before leaving, he encouraged everyone to continue to implement the responsibility system, make greater achievements, and strive for a second prize banner.
　　Since receiving the "Locomotive Leader" prize banner, driver Shang Baoheng also felt very honored and happy, and his work became more active. Upon hearing Representative Song's call, he was the first to respond:
　　"Striving for the second prize banner is no problem! With the Zhu De Locomotive extinguished, we'll do it alone!"
　　Old Hero Li Yong followed up, saying:
　　"If Big Driver Shang says there's no problem, there definitely won't be a problem. What do you all think?"
　　Everyone said:
　　"No problem!" "No problem!"
　　So the group covenant was established! Everyone agreed:
　　No absences, less time at home;
　　Help out when washing the boiler (Note 1);
　　Study maintenance and improve skills;
　　Unite and help each other, complete tasks... and so on.
　　"People are watching with wide eyes, we have to work harder." Someone said to Zheng Dugong.
　　"Right, once we start, we don't stop. Let's do it!"
　　Old Zheng actually answered this way.

　　Note 1: That is, washing the boiler. The B and C inspections are also called washing the boiler.

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）
    （丁克辛轻影作）
            十一、得“机车领袖”奖
    回到段上，老英雄打主意找郑笃恭去说理。
    又一想：自己是司机长；宋代表也说过，当干部，肚里要能撑船，不能眼里下不去一粒沙子。
    想了又想，就忍下这口气。
    老英雄有这么一好：不管遇上什么不痛快的事，只要一见别人关心工作，干活起劲，就乐了。张传忠来找他谈油的问题，他把“委屈”忘记了。
    张传忠谈：软油太稀，车轮一转就把油溅飞了，用硬油又滴不进油管去。汽缸油是最好，但汽缸油一来太贵，二来太缺，怎么办？
    “我也早见到这个了，……咱们自己想办法解决不行吗？”
    “可也得你司机长领导啊。”
    老英雄下决心领导大家研究，把硬油、软油和车轴油搅在一起熬成混合油。
    一试，不仅好使，而且节省：
    哈尔滨到一面坡，一百六十二公里，以前软油用五斤，现在混合油三斤就够了。
    新创造，好办法，领导上把它一推广，全段都称赞“毛泽东号”。
    省煤省油，保护机车，“毛泽东号”都是模范。
    跑车还特别操纵得好！
    没有出过事故，每月安全走行都超过五千公里（当时一般机车每月只能走行三四千公里）。
    十月间评功，被评为一等大功组，得了奖旗一面，上面写着四个大字：
    “机车领袖”。
            十二、响应号召
    冬天来了，东北人民解放军三下江南打击敌人，后方支援前线工作更为加紧。
    要节约人力物力，机车三班人减成两班，“毛泽东号”也调走了张传忠等三个人。
    正好“朱德号”又奉命落火入库。
    机务段宋代表也要调走，他怕大家竞赛情绪受影响，临走还鼓励大家要继续贯彻负责制，做出更大的成绩，争取第二面奖旗。
    自从得了“机车领袖”的奖旗以后，司机商宝恒也感到很光荣很痛快，工作显得积极起来。听宋代表一号召，他就头一个响应道：
    “争取第二面奖旗，没有问题！朱德号落火，咱们独个儿干！”
    李永老英雄跟着说道：
    “商大车说了没问题，一定没问题，大伙儿怎么样？”
    大伙都说：
    “没问题！”“没问题！”
    于是小组公约订立了！大家约好：
    不欠勤，少回家；
    洗罐（注一）时要帮着动手；
    学习检修，提高技术；
    团结互助，完成任务……等等。
    “人们都瞪着大眼看着哪，咱们可得加油干。”有人和郑笃恭说。
    “对，一不做，二不休，干吧！”
    老郑居然这样回答。
    注一：就是洗锅炉。乙丙检也叫洗罐。
