　　Hunan and Zhejiang Provinces
    Widespread Bumper Harvests of Mid-Season Rice
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th] Following the bumper harvest of early rice, the rural areas of Hunan and Zhejiang provinces are reporting widespread bumper harvests of mid-season rice. In Hunan Province, the average yield of mid-season rice (which accounts for more than two-thirds of the total rice acreage) is estimated at 90% of a normal year, even better than the early rice harvest. In the Changsha and Yiyang regions of the province, the mid-season rice harvest is close to 100%, and even the Lingling and Chenzhou regions, which have poorer soil, are reporting 70-80%. This kind of harvest has not been seen in the province for more than a decade. In Zhejiang Province, the mid-season rice harvest was mostly completed by the end of August. The average yield per mu in the Jinhua region is about 350 jin, and the best yields have reached 800 jin, an increase of 10-20% compared to last year. The mid-season rice harvest in the Quzhou region this year is also about 10% higher than last year.
    The bumper rice harvests in the above two provinces this year were achieved under a series of measures implemented by the local people's governments to reward and support agricultural production. Before and after this year's spring plowing, the people's governments at all levels in Hunan Province led the peasants to reduce and return more than 470 million jin of rent grain, helping the peasants solve their production difficulties. At the same time, the Hunan Provincial People's Government issued more than 170 million jin of grain for water conservancy, agricultural loans, and disaster relief for production, repaired more than 3,300 kilometers of dikes, and restored 727 collapsed dikes and waterlogged polders, saving more than 4 million mu of flooded rice fields. During the flood season, the people's governments at all levels in the province vigorously led the peasants to prevent floods and carry out emergency repairs, so that the vast areas along the lakes (Dongting Lake) and rivers (Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li Rivers) safely passed the peak of the flood. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the peasants in Jinhua and Quzhou regions of Zhejiang Province also built more than a thousand large and small water conservancy projects this spring, benefiting one million mu of farmland. In addition, the people's governments of the above two provinces actively led the peasants to eliminate insects and fight drought, greatly reducing the extent of the disasters. For example, in the suburbs of Qu County, Zhejiang, at least 5% of the mid-season rice ears were white in previous years, but this year, due to insect control, white ears only accounted for 1-2%. When a drought appeared in Hunan Province in July, the Provincial People's Government sent more than 270 cadres to the countryside to lead the peasants in fighting the drought, and finally overcame the drought and achieved a bumper harvest.

### 湖南浙江两省  中稻普遍丰收

　　湖南浙江两省
    中稻普遍丰收
    【新华社七日讯】湖南、浙江两省农村继早稻丰收后，中稻又普遍丰收。湖南全省中稻（占稻田总面积三分之二以上）平均达九成年景，收成比早稻还好。该省长沙、益阳两专区中稻收获量且近十成，连地质较贫瘠的零陵、郴州两专区亦达七、八成。这样的年景为该省十多年来所未有。浙江省中稻至八月底已大部收割完毕，金华专区每亩产量为三百五十斤左右，最好的已达八百斤，较去年增产一至二成。衢州专区今年中稻亦比去年增产一成左右。
    上述两省今年稻产的丰收，是在当地人民政府一系列的奖励、扶持农业生产的措施下获得的。今年春耕前后，湖南各地人民政府曾领导农民减回租粮四亿七千余万斤，帮助农民解决了生产上的困难。同时湖南省人民政府又发放了水利、农贷、生产救灾等各种贷粮一亿七千余万斤，共修堤三千三百多公里，修复溃垸、渍垸七百二十七个，救出被灾稻田四百余万亩。防洪期间，该省各地人民政府又大力领导农民防汛抢险，使滨湖（洞庭湖）、临江（湘、资、沅、澧）广大地区安全度过洪水高峰。浙江省金华、衢州两专区农民在人民政府领导下，今春也兴修了大小水利共千余处，受益农田达百万亩。此外，上述两省人民政府又积极领导农民除虫抗旱，大大减轻了灾害的程度。如浙江衢县郊区中季稻往年至少有百分之五的白穗，而今年因经过除虫，白穗仅占百分之一、二。湖南省七月间呈现旱象时，该省人民政府曾派出干部二百七十余名下乡领导农民抗旱，终于战胜了旱灾，获得了丰收。
