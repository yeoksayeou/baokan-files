　　Democratic Parties in Beijing
    Send Off Personnel Participating in Land Reform
    First Group of Forty-One People Have Left Beijing for Shanghai
    [This Newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, respectively held gatherings to send off party members and league members who are participating in land reform work. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang had previously issued instructions calling on its party members to participate in land reform work. Party members of the Beijing branch were the first to respond to the call, with more than fifty people signing up to participate. The committee convened a meeting on August 30 for party members who had signed up to participate in land reform, and Zhu Yunshan, Minister of the Central Organization Department of the committee, and Ning Wu, Standing Committee member of the Beijing branch, attended the meeting to give instructions on the preparations that should be made and the matters that should be paid attention to when participating in land reform work. On the morning of September 1, a farewell symposium was held, presided over by Li Jishen, chairman of the committee. Attendees included members of the Central Standing Committee, general branch staff, and more than seventy party members participating in land reform work. Chairman Li Jishen first gave a speech, explaining the importance of land reform and the attitude that should be adopted when participating in land reform work. Shao Lizi, Chen Mingshu, Cai Tingkai, Chen Shaoxian, Mei Gongbin, Xu Baoju, Li Shizhang, Yu Zhenying, Ning Wu, and others continued to speak, unanimously encouraging the party members participating in land reform to work hard to complete their tasks and to strive to learn and transform themselves in practical work. The symposium lasted three hours. Finally, Yang Jixian delivered a reply, guaranteeing that the tasks would be completed.
    Nineteen members of the China Democratic League, including Zhang Zhihe, Luo Ziwei, and Chen Xingui, signed up to participate in land reform work and were approved. The League headquarters and the Beijing branch held a farewell tea party on the 7th.
    The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held a dinner party on the 3rd to send off thirty-one party members who had been approved to participate in land reform work. Zhang Bojun, chairman of the party, and Peng Zemin, member of the Central Working Committee, both attended the meeting and spoke, hoping that everyone would learn modestly in their work and adhere to the revolutionary stance.
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th [This Newspaper] According to a report in Guangming Daily on the 11th: The first group of forty-one people from various democratic parties in Beijing who have been approved to participate in land reform work left Beijing for Shanghai on the afternoon of the 10th. They will participate in short-term studies on land reform policies and laws in Shanghai, and then go to various land reform areas in East China to carry out their work. Among the forty-one people, there are twelve members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, fourteen members of the China Democratic League, thirteen members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and two non-party members.
    While publishing the above news, the Beijing Guangming Daily published an editorial entitled "Sending Off Comrades Participating in Land Reform Work," stating: Land reform is a serious and fierce class struggle. It is not only a revolutionary struggle by the peasant class to overthrow the landlord class, but also a revolutionary struggle by the four revolutionary classes to eliminate the common enemy. It is precisely for this reason that the democratic parties have requested to actively participate in land reform work and strive to realize the basic policy of "land to the tiller" in the Common Program. This shows the further strengthening of the people's democratic united front and the further consolidation of the people's democratic regime. The editorial called on the comrades participating in land reform work to stand firm on the revolutionary stance, improve themselves, transform themselves, and temper themselves in the actual struggle.

　　北京各民主党派
    欢送参加土改人员出发
    首批四十一人已由京赴沪
    【本报讯】据新华社消息：中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、中国农工民主党，分别集会欢送参加土地改革工作的党员、盟员出发工作。中国国民党革命委员会前曾发出指示，号召该会党员参加土地改革工作。北京市分部党员首先响应号召，报名参加者达五十余人。该会于八月三十日召集报名参加土地改革的党员举行会议，该会中央组织部朱蕴山部长和北京市分部常委宁武到会指示关于参加土地改革工作应有的准备和应注意的事项。并于九月一日上午举行欢送座谈会，由该会主席李济深主持，出席会议的有中常委、总分部工作人员及参加土地改革工作的党员七十余人。李济深主席首先致词，说明土地改革的重要和参加土地改革工作应有的态度。继续发言的有邵力子、陈铭枢、蔡廷锴、陈劭先、梅龚彬、许宝驹、李世璋、于振瀛、宁武等，大家一致勉励此次参加土地改革的党员，要一面好好工作完成任务，一面在实际工作中努力学习改造自己。座谈历三小时，最后由杨集贤代表致答词，保证一定完成任务。
    中国民主同盟盟员报名参加土地改革工作并经核准通过的，有张志和、罗子为、陈新桂等十九人。该盟总部暨北京市支部于七日举行欢送茶会。
    中国农工民主党于三日举行聚餐会，欢送业经核准参加土地改革工作的三十一名党员。该党主席章伯钧、中央工作委员会委员彭泽民均到会讲话，希望大家在工作中虚心学习，坚持革命立场。
    【新华社十二日讯】据光明日报十一日载：北京市各民主党派人员经核准参加土地改革工作的首批四十一人，已于十日下午离北京赴上海。他们将在上海参加关于土地改革政策、法令的短期学习，再分赴华东各实行土地改革地区进行工作。四十一人中，计中国国民党革命委员会党员十二人，中国民主同盟盟员十四人，中国农工民主党党员十三人，无党派人士二人。
    北京光明日报在发表上述消息同时，以《送参加土地改革工作的同志们》为题发表社论称：土地改革是严重的、激烈的阶级斗争。它不仅是农民阶级为推翻地主阶级而进行的革命斗争，也是四个革命阶级为消灭共同敌人而进行的革命斗争。正是为了这个缘故，各民主党派要求主动地参加土地改革工作，为实现共同纲领中“耕者有其田”的基本方针而努力。这表明人民民主统一战线的进一步加强，人民民主政权的进一步巩固。社论号召参加土地改革工作的同志们，必须站稳革命的立场，在实际的斗争中提高自己，改造自己，锻炼自己。
