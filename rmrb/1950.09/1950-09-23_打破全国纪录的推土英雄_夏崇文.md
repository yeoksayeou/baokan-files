　　Xia Chongwen - Heroic Earthmover Who Broke the National Record
    In the spring, when the Yellow River levee repairs began, people were amazed by the deeds of Wang Chuanjia and Wang Chuanxin, two heroes who moved eighteen cubic meters of earth; however, soon after, a hero emerged who moved twenty-seven cubic meters of earth every day. This almost mythical news quickly spread throughout the Yellow River region.
    This hero is named Xia Chongwen, from Huangchang Village, Sixth District, Juancheng County, Pingyuan Province. He is thirty-five years old this year and of poor peasant background. When Xia Chongwen was a child, his family only had two dilapidated thatched huts. His father was blind and unable to work, so his mother made tofu and fried dough sticks, and Chongwen led his father, who carried the tofu and fried dough sticks, to sell them in nearby villages to earn a living. Chongwen and his mother also ran a butcher shop and sold vegetables. The family struggled through life in this way for many years. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, Xia Chongwen also participated in levee repairs, but working under the "official management," the foremen exploited the workers as much as possible. The wages were pitifully low. Xia Chongwen worked himself to exhaustion, but his life remained difficult, without enough to eat or wear.
    In 1940, a democratic government was established in the area. In 1942, there was a severe drought. The People's Government called on people to dig wells to prepare for the famine. Xia Chongwen mobilized the masses to organize well-digging teams and actively dig wells to prepare for the famine.
    After the land reform, he was allocated eight acres of land and also some bricks to build two houses. With a joyful heart, he actively cultivated his own land and also engaged in some sideline occupations in his spare time. His wife weaved at home. Life got better day by day. During the levee repairs this May, the leadership called for a movement to move ten cubic meters of earth. He was the first to respond actively. He said, "If others can move sixteen cubic meters, I will move seventeen cubic meters; if others can move eighteen cubic meters, I will move nineteen cubic meters. Everyone is contributing, whoever proposes it, I will compete with them."
    On May 6th, the Yellow River levee reinforcement project began. Xia Chongwen pushed a small cart and carried an iron shovel, dug an earth pit, and loaded and transported the earth himself. From 4:30 to 6:50 in the morning, he worked for two hours and twenty minutes and moved fifty-one carts of earth. After breakfast, he worked for five hours and moved ninety-three carts. After lunch, he worked for five hours and forty minutes and moved one hundred and seven carts of earth. He worked for thirteen hours a day, moving a total of 27.65 cubic meters of earth (the soil was half silt and half sand). The transport distance was six to seven meters. At that time, the wage per cubic meter was 1.99 jin of rice, so Xia Chongwen earned 54.61 jin in wages that day. This miraculous news quickly spread throughout the entire work section, and the laborers and nearby masses all came to see him. When Xia Chongwen easily pushed a cart loaded with three to four hundred pounds of earth, everyone cheered. Xia Chongwen became the model for the levee repair competition, creating a new national record for earthmoving. This time, he was selected as a representative to attend the National Labor Model Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.

　　打破全国纪录的推土英雄——夏崇文
    春天，黄河开始复堤时，人们以惊奇的心情议论着两位推十八方土的英雄王传家、王传信的事迹；然而不久之后却出现了一位每天推二十七方土的英雄。这神话似的消息，很快的传遍了黄河两岸。
    这位英雄叫夏崇文，是平原鄄城六区黄常庄人，今年三十五岁，贫农成份。夏崇文小时，家中只有两间破草棚，他爹是个瞎子不能做活，靠娘磨豆腐、炸油条，崇文牵着父亲，父亲挑着豆腐、油条到附近各村去卖，赚些钱过活。崇文和娘还开过肉铺，卖过青菜。一家生活就是这样挣扎着过了许多年。在国民党反动派统治时期，夏崇文也参加过复堤，但在“官棚子”的统治下作工，包工头为了尽量的剥削工人，工钱少得可怜，夏崇文做得筋疲力尽，生活依然很苦，吃不饱，穿不暖。
    一九四○年当地建立了民主政权。一九四二年大旱。人民政府号召打井备荒，夏崇文就发动群众组织打井班，积极打井备荒。
    土改后，他分到了八亩地，又分了一些砖，盖了两间房。他怀着愉快的心情，在自己的土地上积极耕作，闲时还搞些副业。妻子在家纺织。生活一天一天好起来。今年五月复堤中，领导上号召开展推十方土运动，他首先积极响应。他说：“人家能推十六方，我推十七方；人家能推十八方，我推十九方。大家都是出力的人，谁提出来我和谁比赛。”
    五月六日加修黄堤工程开工了，夏崇文推一辆小车，扛一把铁锨，挖了一个土塘，自装自运。早上四点半到六点五十分，工作了两点二十分钟，他推了五十一车土。早饭后工作了五个钟头，推了九十三车。午饭后工作了五点四十分钟，推土一百零七车。一天作工十三个钟头，共推土二十七点六五方（土质是半淤半沙）。运距六七公尺。当时每方工资米一·九九斤，夏崇文在这一天就挣得工资五四·六一斤。这个奇迹似的消息马上传遍了全工段，民工和附近群众都跑来参观。当夏崇文很轻快的推起三、四百斤重的土车时，大家都随着喝起彩来。夏崇文成了复堤比赛的方向，创造了推土的全国最高纪录。这次他当选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表。
