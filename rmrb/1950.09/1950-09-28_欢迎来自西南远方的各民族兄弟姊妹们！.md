　　Welcome, Brothers and Sisters from All Ethnic Groups in the Far Southwest!
　　Our Newspaper Reporter Bai Sheng

　　The station was crowded with teams welcoming the brotherly ethnic groups, and children were singing joyfully!

　　The train carrying the delegation and performing arts troupe of various ethnic groups from the Southwest to celebrate National Day pulled into the platform at exactly 10:00 am on September 26th. An excited and enthusiastic atmosphere filled the hearts of every welcomer.

　　Brothers and sisters from brotherly ethnic groups from remote regions of the motherland, for many years, from their grandfathers to their generation, have never been to such a large capital city – the people's capital city. However, today they have traveled a long journey, they have come, gloriously come, to the place they have long dreamed of in mythology.

　　Different ethnic costumes, different ethnic languages, from Yunnan, from Xikang, from the remote mountainous areas of Guizhou, they brought a common will and a common feeling, that is a deep love for the motherland, for the people's leader Chairman Mao.

　　When the children of the Capital Young Pioneers, wearing red scarves, presented bouquets of flowers to the hands of more than a hundred members of the delegation and the performing arts troupe, music played. A warm and affectionate feeling filled the entire welcoming venue. The head of the delegation, Wang Weizhou, smiled and nodded kindly to the children. Li Weihan, Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, and Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, warmly shook hands with the representatives one by one.

　　Two young men from the Miao ethnic group, holding high the red flag of the delegation, guided the team slowly forward from the platform, while the waist drum team of the Central Academy of Drama Performing Arts Troupe beat loud gongs and drums, welcoming the brothers and sisters of all ethnic groups with the most affectionate feelings. A knowing smile and an expression of excitement were revealed on the faces of the brothers and sisters of all ethnic groups.

　　The members of the brotherly ethnic groups' performing arts troupes, wearing beautiful ethnic costumes, some very simple and others exceptionally gorgeous. They wore different ornaments on their heads, necks, and ears, and some held musical instruments such as lusheng in their hands. Among them were the Yi, Axi, and Sani ethnic groups from Yunnan, the Tibetan ethnic group from Xikang and the Yi ethnic group from the Greater Liang Mountains, and the Miao ethnic group from the mountainous areas of Guizhou. They appeared so enthusiastic, young, full of ethnic flavor and rich and colorful colors.

　　On the eve of the motherland's first National Day, our brothers and sisters of this big family of ethnic friendship and cooperation will joyfully gather in the people's capital. This united and victorious gathering will make the American aggressors tremble! Let them see! How powerful is the unity of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China!

　　欢迎来自西南远方的各民族兄弟姊妹们！
    本报记者  柏生
    车站上拥满了欢迎兄弟民族的队伍，孩子们欢欣地歌唱着！
    载着西南各民族庆祝国庆代表团和文工团的列车，在九月二十六日正十时驶进了月台。兴奋热烈地情绪，充溢在每个欢迎者的心上。
    来自祖国遥远地区的兄弟民族的兄弟姊妹，多少年来，从他们的祖父到他们这一代，从没有来到过像这样大的京城—人民的京城。然而，今天他们跋涉了辽远的旅途，来了，光荣地来了，来到他们久已在神话中想望过的地方。
    不同民族的衣饰，不同民族的语言，从云南、从西康，从贵州遥远的山区里，他们带来了一个共同的意志和共同的感情，那就是对祖国，对人民领袖毛主席的深湛的热爱。
    当结着红领巾的首都少年儿童队的孩子们，捧着一束束的鲜花，拥送到百多个代表团和文工团团员们的手里的时候，乐声奏起了。一种热烈亲爱的感情，洋溢在整个的欢迎会场上。代表团的团长王维舟亲切地向孩子们笑着，点着头。民族事务委员会主任李维汉和北京市人民政府副市长吴晗亲热地和代表们一一握手。
    两个苗族的青年，高擎着代表团的红色旗帜，引导着队伍徐徐从月台上向前走的时候，中央戏剧学院文工团的腰鼓队敲着响亮的锣鼓，以最亲切的感情，迎接着各民族的兄弟姐妹们。一种会心的欢笑和兴奋的表情，呈露在各民族兄弟姐妹们的脸上。
    兄弟民族的文工团团员们，穿着美丽的民族服装，有的非常质朴，也有的异常华丽。她们的头上、颈上、耳上戴着不同的饰物，有的手里还拿着六笙等乐器。他们这里有来自云南的彝族、阿细族和撒尼族，有来自西康的藏族和大凉山上的彝族，也有来自贵州山区的苗族，他们显得是那么热情年青，充满了民族的情调和丰富鲜艳的色彩。
    在这祖国第一个国庆的前夕，我们这各民族友爱合作的大家庭的兄弟姐妹们将欢乐地团聚在人民的首都。这个团结胜利的欢聚，将使美国侵略者颤栗！让他们看着吧！中华人民共和国各民族团结起来的力量是多么强大！
