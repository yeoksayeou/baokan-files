Editor's Note: The following three excerpts from Lenin and Stalin opposing commandism can be used as study material for party rectification in various regions. Lenin and Stalin's opinions regarding the treatment of peasants are not only applicable to peasants in China today, but also generally applicable to people of all strata other than peasants.

We must avoid all things that can practically facilitate individual malpractices. Some careerists and ambitious individuals have already infiltrated our ranks in some places. These people deceive us by claiming to be communists. They have infiltrated our ranks because the Communist Party now holds power, and because those more honest "civil servants" have not come to work with us due to their backward thinking, while these ambitious individuals have no ideology and no conscience. These people only seek promotion and advancement. They implement coercive measures everywhere and think this is a good method…

Previously, we had to use desperate leaps to escape the imperialist war, because this war had bankrupted us, and we had to work hard to defeat those forces that wanted to overwhelm us. All of this was necessary, otherwise we could not have won at the time. But if we take the same approach to dealing with middle peasants, that is utter foolishness, utter stupidity, utterly sufficient to undermine our cause, and only splitters would consciously do so. The task now should be completely different.

But even if the decrees are correct, it is incorrect to force the peasants to accept them. No such thing is said in any decree. These decrees, as the indicated path, as a call for practical facilities, are correct. When we say, "Encourage the establishment of cooperatives," this is equivalent to issuing instructions, which should be tested many times to find the final form for implementing these instructions. Since it is said that voluntary consent must be obtained, that is to say, the peasants must be persuaded, and the peasants must be persuaded in practice. Peasants will not believe empty words; and they are right not to believe empty words. It would be a bad thing if they rashly believed after hearing the decrees and propaganda leaflets. If economic life can be transformed in this way, then this transformation is worthless...

First implement assistance, then gain trust. If this matter can be carried out correctly, if every step of our working group is done correctly in the county, in the district, in the grain requisition team, in any organization, if every step is carefully reviewed from this point of view, then we will definitely gain the trust of the peasants. Only then can we continue. Now we should give assistance to the peasants and give them advice. This should not be the command of a commander, but the advice of a comrade. Then the peasants will fully support us. (Excerpt from Lenin's report on rural work at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in March 1919)

…Communists must abandon all deformed administrative means in the countryside. It is not enough to use a command method for the peasants. They should patiently explain to the peasants the problems they do not understand, so that the peasants are convinced. When doing this, don't be afraid to sacrifice time and energy. Some of our leading cadres often issue orders and are done with it. This is certainly easier and simpler. However, not everything that is simple and easy is good. Not long ago, a town party secretary replied to the provincial party committee representative's question about the town's lack of newspapers, saying: "Why do we need newspapers? It is quieter and more appropriate without newspapers, otherwise the peasants will question everything after reading the newspapers, which is extremely troublesome." This secretary is also called a communist! It really does not need to be proved that this is not a communist, but an unfortunate thing. Comrades! In fact, leadership now requires "trouble," and it is even more impossible without newspapers. If we want to maintain the leadership of the Party and Soviet power in the countryside, we must understand and comprehend this simple truth.

Secondly, to implement leadership now, we must be good at managing the economy, and we must know and understand the economy. Now, only talking about "world politics" and ranting about Chamberlain and MacDonald will not accomplish great things. We are in a period of economic construction. Therefore, only those who understand the economy, only those who are good at giving useful advice to the peasants in terms of economic development, only those who are good at helping the peasants in economic construction, can lead. Studying the economy, contacting the economy, and participating in economic construction meticulously is now the task of communists in the countryside. Without the above abilities, leadership is simply not to be dreamed of. (Excerpt from Stalin's "Summary of the Work of the Fourteenth Conference of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" in May 1925)

…Victory can sometimes go to people's heads. Victory often produces a psychology of boasting and arrogance. People in the ruling party are particularly prone to this problem. It is especially easy for people in a party like ours, which has unlimited power and prestige, to suffer from this problem. The manifestation of communist arrogance, which Lenin denounced, is very likely to occur here. The psychology of believing in the omnipotence of decrees, the omnipotence of resolutions, and the omnipotence of instructions is very likely to occur here. The danger that the Party's revolutionary facilities will become empty bureaucratic command methods of individual Party representatives in a corner of our vast country is very real here. I am referring not only to local staff, but also to individual provincial party committee staff, and even individual members of the Central Committee. Lenin said: "Communist arrogance means that some people who are in the Communist Party and have not yet been purged actually want to use the name of the Communist Party to issue orders and solve all his own tasks."

### 列宁、斯大林论必须反对用强迫命令手段对待农民

专栏：

　　列宁、斯大林论
    必须反对用强迫命令手段对待农民
    编者按：这里节录的列宁、斯大林反对命令主义的三段文字，可以作为各地整党的学习资料。列宁、斯大林关于对待农民所说的意见，在目前中国不独适用于农民，一般地也适用于对待农民以外的各阶层的人民。
    必须避免所有一切能在实践上助长个别舞弊现象的事情。有些钻营分子、野心家，已在某些地方混入了我们的队伍内，这种人自称为共产主义者来愚弄我们，他们之所以钻进我们队伍里来，是因为共产党现在掌握政权，是因为那些比较诚实的“公务人员”由于他们的思想落后，没有来到我们这里工作，而这班野心家却毫无思想，毫无良心。这种人只求升迁拔擢，他们在各地实行强迫手段，并且以为这是很好的办法。……
    以前我们是必须无论如何都要用拚命跳跃的手段，来赶急跳出帝国主义战争，因为这个战争把我们弄到破产了，必须拚命努力来击溃那些想来压倒我们的力量。所有这一切都是必须的，不这样，我们当时便不能获得胜利。但是如果对待中农也采取同样方式来行动，那就是十足的愚痴，十足的鲁钝，十足地足以颠覆我们的事业，只有挑拨离间分子才能自觉地这样做。现在的任务应当完全是另一样的。
    但法令虽然是正确，若用强力去强迫农民来接受，便是不正确的了。在任何一个法令中都没有这样说过。这些法令，作为指明出来的道路，作为进行实际设施的号召，是正确的。当我们说：“鼓励建立合作社吧。”这等于发出指令，这指令是应当经过多次试验，以便找到实行这些指令的最后形式。既然说必须求得自愿同意，也就是说，要说服农民，要在实践中说服农民。农民不会相信空话；而他们不相信空话，这是做得很对的。要是他们一听到宣读法令和鼓动传单就妄自相信，那倒是不好的事情。假使可以这样来改造经济生活，那末这种改造一文不值。……
    首先实行帮助，然后去取得信任吧。如果这件事情能正确地进行下去，如果在县里，区里，在征粮队里，在任何组织里，我们每个工作团的每一步骤都做得正确，如果我们的每一步骤都会从这个观点来仔细加以检阅，那时我们定能取得农民的信任。只有那时，我们才能继续进行。现在我们应当给农民以帮助，给他们以忠告。这应当不是指挥官的命令，而是同志的忠告。那时农民就会完全拥护我们的。（节录列宁一九一九年三月在俄国共产党（布）第八次代表大会上关于农村工作的报告）
    ……必须使共产主义者在乡村中放弃一切畸形的行政手段。对于农民不能只限于一种命令的方法。应该耐烦地对农民解释他们所不了解的问题，使农民心悦诚服。做这种事的时候，不要怕牺牲时间和精力。我们中间有些作领导工作的人，时常是发号施令了事。这当然是要容易得多，简单得多。然而不是一切简单而容易的事都是好的。不久以前有一个镇委书记答复省委代表所提出的该镇缺乏报纸的问题，他说：“我们何必要报纸呢？没有报纸，倒还安静和妥当些，不然农民们一经阅报，他们又要质问一切，麻烦极了。”这个书记也称为共产主义者哩！实在不待证明，这不是共产主义者，而是一个不幸的东西罢了。同志们！事实上现在要实行领导，非有“麻烦”不可，若没有报纸，那就更是不行。倘若我们想保持党和苏维埃政权在乡村中的领导，就必须了解和领会这个简单的道理。
    其次，现在要实行领导，必须善于管理经济，必须知道和了解经济。现在只会高谈“世界政治”，狂论张伯伦和麦克唐纳，是做不出大事来的。我们正逢经济建设的时期。因此，只有了解经济的人，只有善于在经济发展方面向农民作有益忠告的人，只有善于扶助农民经济建设的人，他才能领导。研究经济，与经济相接触，无微不至地参加经济建设，便是现在共产主义者在乡村中的任务。没有上述的能力，领导一事简直不要梦想好了。（节录自斯大林一九二五年五月“俄共（布）第十四次代表会议工作的总结”）
    ……胜利有时能冲昏人们的头脑。胜利往往产生出一种自夸自大的心理。执政党中的人特别容易患这种毛病。特别是像我们党这样具有无限力量和威望的政党中的人，更容易患这种毛病。列宁所痛斥的那种共产党员夸大狂的表现，在这里是很有可能发生的。相信法令万能、决议万能和训令万能的心理，在这里是很有可能发生的。党的革命设施在我们广阔国家某个角落里变为党个别代表的空洞官僚式命令手段的危险，在这里是很实在的。我所指的，不仅是地方工作人员，而且是个别省委工作人员，而且是个别中央委员。列宁说：“共产党员夸大狂，就是说有一些侧身于共产党内而还没有被清洗出去的人，竟妄想用共产党员名义来发号施令，便能解决他自己的一切任务。”（节录斯大林“给集体农庄工作同志们的答复”）
