　　Gao You Station Water Level Falls Daily
    Northern Jiangsu Canal Passes Danger Period
    Guaranteeing a Bumper Harvest of 15 Million Mu of Autumn Grain
    [Report from this newspaper] The floodwaters of the Northern Jiangsu Canal have been receding daily and have now passed the danger period, guaranteeing a bumper harvest in northern Jiangsu this year. The canal's water level began to drop in late August. By 7:00 AM on September 10, the water level at Gao You Station had fallen to 7.98 meters. The highest water level at Gao You this year was 8.59 meters on August 2nd and 3rd, exceeding the danger level of 8.44 meters by 0.14 meters. However, under the leadership of the Northern Jiangsu People's Government and the Communist Party Committee, and through the arduous struggle of more than 2,000 cadres and 150,000 laborers for over a month, the serious flood has been overcome, the dangerous period of the August flood has been passed, and 15 million mu of crops east of the Northern Jiangsu Canal have been guaranteed a bumper harvest. However, it is not impossible for autumn floods to rise again, so we must continue to be vigilant and not be paralyzed or slack, in order to strive for final victory. At present, autumn harvesting is being carried out everywhere. The banks of the canal are a sea of gold, the new rice grains are plump, and the yellow ears are drooping. The farmers are busy harvesting, and pleasant mountain songs are constantly heard in the fields, filling the air with a new atmosphere. (Guang Yu)

　　高邮站水位逐日下落
    苏北运河度过危险期
    保证了一千五百万亩秋禾丰收
    【本报讯】苏北运河洪水已逐日下落，现已度过危险期，保证了今年苏北丰收。运河水位自八月下旬起即开始下降，至九月十日晨七时，高邮站水位已落到七·九八公尺。按高邮今年八月二、三日最高水位到八·五九公尺，已超过危险水位八·四四公尺的○·一四公尺，但在苏北人民政府及中共党委的领导下，经二千多干部、十五万民工月余的艰苦斗争，已战胜严重的洪水，度过八月大汛的危险期，使苏北运河以东地区一千五百万亩庄稼，获得丰收。但秋汛回涨并非没有可能，仍应继续警惕，不要麻痹松懈，以争取最后胜利。目前各地正普遍进行秋收，运河堤岸一片金黄，新稻颗粒肥大，黄穗垂头，农民们正紧张收割，田野里不时发出愉快的山歌声，充满了一片新的气象。（光宇）
