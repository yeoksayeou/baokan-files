　　Some Opinions on Editions
    Beijing Library
    I. On the Recording of Book and Publication Copyright Pages

    What items should be recorded on the copyright page of books and publications? There needs to be a relatively uniform regulation. For example, the title of the book, number of volumes or sequence, author – if it is a translation, it is even more necessary to note the nationality of the original author, the original author's name, and the translated name – translator, publisher and detailed address, publication date, edition, etc. If a book is revised, augmented, or a corrected edition, it must be noted. In the past, many newly published books and publications did not pay enough attention to this aspect. Copyright pages were recorded too briefly, and some even lacked copyright pages, making it impossible to determine the publication date. Some periodicals also do not indicate the issue period, such as weekly, ten-day, semi-monthly, monthly, etc., and some do not indicate volume and issue numbers. It is hoped that there will be a unified regulation for these as well.

    II. Regarding Translation Issues

    (1) Because of different translators, the same original work is translated into two different book titles. For example, the recently published "North Korea" and "We Saw Korea" are fundamentally the same original work. Also, "The Tragedy of Lonely Village" and "I Am the Son of the Working People" are fundamentally the same original work. In this situation, we have no right to force the unification of the translated names, but we require that translated books and publications must include the original title, which will easily solve the problem. This should be a help that publishers and translators are happy to provide to readers and library workers!

    (2) In translated books, various works by the same original author have different translated names due to different translators (or even the same translator). For example, A. Gonchar, A. Gontchar, Gontchar, etc., are listed on pages 1, 2, and 3 of the "National New Publication Book Catalog"; and Sholokhov, M.A. has the following different translated names: Xiao Luohuo Fu, Shao Luohuo Pu, Suo Luohuo Fu, Suo Luo Huo Fu, Xiao Luo Hao Fu, etc. Also, the recently published "The Soviet National Economic Plan" and "The Design of the Soviet National Economic Plan" are originally the same, but because of different translators, the book titles and the translated names of the original author have diverged. It is extremely necessary to seek uniformity, or at least to note the original author's original name, and it is of course even more necessary to indicate the nationality of the original author.

    (3) Soviet writers have compound surnames. The convention is to use a small "hyphen" between the compound surnames, but many translators do not pay attention to this, or they just add a small "dot," which is easily confused with the full translation of a single surname. We hope that publishers and translators will pay attention to this point.

    (4) We have no right to demand the cancellation of the freedom to "sign as one pleases at the time of publication" for some translators' signatures, but we hope that it can be unified through the Publishing Administration or other new book reviews, translator and author biographies, or introductory texts. Here, we can point out at random that in the book "Timiryazev," the signature is Tao Translated, while there is also a book "The Biography of Timiryazhev," signed by Zhu Binsheng Translated, but in fact, they are originally the same book, translated by the same person. We made this judgment after a lot of checking and research. But we are still not sure if it is correct.

    (5) Some translated books often change a book title into two because of different editions. For example, Li Jiye's translation of "Collection of Stories of Patriotic Heroes" was called "After Death" when it was published in Chongqing. In this case, we also hope that other translators can make a supplementary explanation by themselves, like Mr. Li.

    III. Some Issues Regarding Book Titles, Page Numbers, Proofreading, and Printing

    (1) Some books are published with two different names because of different publishing houses. For example, the Sanlian edition of Zhao Dongyin's "Value and Surplus Value" is the Living edition of "Introduction to Economics." There are also some collections with the same content, but the book titles are misused due to different publishing houses. Such examples are too numerous to mention. We hope that this situation will be reduced as much as possible in the future.

    (2) Some books often have independently numbered pages for each chapter. This makes it very troublesome for readers and library workers to count. We suggest that for books with independently numbered pages for each chapter, a total page number should be added below the individual page number, like the "General Catalogue of the Complete Library in Four Sections" published by the Commercial Press in the Wanyou Wenku edition.

    (3) Many books are not well proofread. We hope to correct this irresponsible shortcoming for readers as much as possible in the future.

    (4) In some popular readings, illustrations occupy a considerable proportion. It seems that the authors of the illustrations should also be noted.

    (5) Children's books should be printed clearly, bound particularly firmly, and the paper should also be of better quality, because some books are torn apart by children after only a few days of reading. The binding of current comic books is generally not very strong.

    (6) Now, children generally have a very high enthusiasm for reading comic books, but there are very few that are suitable for children. We hope that more comic books that are suitable for children will be published.

    Editor's Note: We completely agree with the above opinions raised by the Beijing Library and add the following:

    I. The copyright page is a symbol of the publication and should be treated with solemnity. This is not just a technical issue of publishing work, but a "most serious political work," as Comrade Chen Boda said: "This also illustrates whether our publishers attach importance to historical viewpoints." Now, many books were originally published before liberation. When reprinting, the copyright page either indicates "First edition in a certain month of 1949" or "First edition in a certain month of 1950," while there are many places in the content that are not in line with the current political situation. This not only confuses many new readers, but also has a negative impact. In the readers' letters we received, there are many criticisms of this kind of "first edition books." The article "On Reprinted Books" published in the "Reading and Publication" section of the Shanghai Dagong Bao on August 10 specifically pointed out many examples of errors made by the Sanlian Bookstore. The Sanlian Shanghai Office explained in an open letter: "Our so-called first edition refers to the first time it was printed by the Sanlian unit." This reason is one-sided, and it also cannot explain the more erroneous fact of changing the book title (in addition to "Value and Surplus Value" and "Introduction to Economics" pointed out in the Beijing Library article, we have also received a letter from Mr. Du Ping of Northeast Normal University in Changchun, pointing out that the Sanlian edition of "Outline of Philosophical Study" and the "Elementary Outline of Philosophical Study" previously published under the name of Practice Publishing House are two different names for the same book). Sanlian should attach importance to the historical viewpoint of reading materials, and at the same time, in order to take care of its own glorious history, it should have detailed records on the copyright page. This issue involves not only the publications of Sanlian alone. We hope that all public and private publishers will not ignore this issue.

    II. The translated books should record in detail the original author's real name, nationality, the original book's publication date, and the original book's original title. The book "A History of the Democratic Movement in the Modern World" only showed the Chinese translation of the original author's name on the cover and title page. There is a translator's preface, but it does not mention a word about the original author, the original book's publication date, or where it was published. The time of writing is an important clue to the content of the book. Ignoring this point will definitely affect the reader's understanding of the work. "New Vietnam" indicates the original author's nationality, but the year the original book was published cannot be found.

### 对版本的一些意见

　　对版本的一些意见
    北京图书馆
    一  书刊版权页的著录问题
    书刊版权页究应著录那些项目，这是需要有个比较划一的规定的。譬如书名、册数或册次、著者——要是译本的话，将原著者的国籍、著者原名以及译名一并注出，更属必要——译者、出版处及详细地址、出版年月、版次等等。如一书为修改、增订，或修正本，更必需注明。过去有好些新出版的书刊，对于这方面太不注意了。版权页著录过简，有的连版权页都没有的，出版年月就无从标明出来。有些期刊也不注明刊期，如周刊、旬刊、半月刊、月刊等，有的也不注明卷期。这些也希望能有个一致性的规定。
    二  关于翻译方面的问题
    （一）同是一个原本，因为译者的不同，就把它译成两个书名了。例如最近出版的《北朝鲜》和《我们看到了朝鲜》，根本就是一个原本。还有《孤村情劫》和《我是劳动人民的儿子》，也根本是一个原本。在这种情形下，我们没有权利强求其译名统一，但我们要求的是翻译书刊必须附注原文名称，这就不难解决这个问题。这应该是出版家和译者所乐于给读者和图书馆工作者帮忙的吧！
    （二）翻译的书籍，一个原著者的各种不同著作，有因译者的不同（甚或同是一个译者）就把一个人译成两个不同的译名了。例如：《全国新出版图书目录》一二三面所著录的Ａ·龚察尔、Ａ·冈察尔、冈察尔等；又如，Sholokhov，Ｍ·Ａ·，译名就有如下的不同：萧洛霍夫、邵洛霍甫、梭洛霍夫、梭罗霍夫、萧洛浩夫等。又如最近出版的《苏联国民经济计划》，与《苏联国民经济计划的设计》，本来就是同一原本，因为译者的不同，就把书名和原著者的译名都分歧了。这实在是极应谋求划一，或至少必须注出原作者的原名来的，至于标明原作者的国籍当然更属必要了。
    （三）苏联作家有复姓的。通例复姓之间都是用一小“横”，但很多译者是不注意这一点的，或者就随便加一个小圆“点”，这是很容易和单姓的全译混淆不清的，我们希望出版家与译者注意到这一点。
    （四）有些译者的署名，我们没有权利要求其取消“出版时署名听便”的自由，但我们希望通过出版总署或其他新书评介、译者著者小传或介绍之类的文字，能够使它统一起来。这里我们可以信手指出的，如《季米里亚席夫》一书，署名涛译，而又有《季米里亚希夫传》一书，署名朱滨生译，其实原来同是一书，译者同是一人。我们作这样判定，是费过不少翻检之劳和考据工夫的。但还不敢确定其是否正确。
    （五）有的翻译书籍因为版次的不同，就往往把一个书名改成两个。如李霁野译的《卫国英雄故事集》，在重庆出版时书名是叫《死后》。像这种情形，我们也希望其他译者能和李先生一样，由自己作一附带说明。
    三  关于书名、页次、校对和印刷方面的一些问题
    （一）有的书因为出版处的不同，竟把一个书用两个名字出版出来，如三联版赵冬垠的《价值与剩余价值》就是生活版的《经济学初步》。还有些集子，内容相同，由于出版处的不同，竟把书名滥用起来，这种例子更是举不胜举了。我们希望以后这种情形尽量减少才好。
    （二）有的书往往因篇章的各自独立，页次也是各自起讫的。这使读者和图书馆工作者统计起来非常麻烦。我们建议凡是一种篇章页次各自起讫的书籍，能够在单独页次之下，加印一个总页次的号码，像商务版所出版的万有文库本《四库全书总目提要》那样。
    （三）有好多书校对的都不够好，以后希望尽量纠正这项对读者不负责任的缺点。
    （四）有些通俗读物中，插图占有相当的比重，似乎也应当把插图的作者标注出来。
    （五）儿童读物希望能印刷得清楚，装订得特别坚固，纸张也要用好点的，因为有的书儿童看不了几天就破烂了。现在一般连环画的装订都不很结实。
    （六）现在一般儿童对阅读连环画的情绪非常高，但适合儿童的却很少，希望多出版些适合儿童的。
    编者按：我们完全同意北京图书馆所提的如上的意见，并作补充如下：
    一、版权页是出版物的标志，是应该郑重处理的。这不只是出版工作的一个技术问题，而是一个“最严肃的政治工作”，诚如陈伯达同志所说：“这也就是说明我们的出版工作者重不重视历史观点的问题。”现在有很多书籍原是在解放前出版的，重版时，在版权页上不是标明“一九四九年某月初版”，便是标明“一九五○年某月初版”，而内容是有许多地方与当前政治形势不相符合的，这样不但使许多新读者搞不清楚，而且会产生不良的影响。在我们所收到的读者来信中，对于这种“初版书”的责难是很多的。八月十日上海大公报《读书与出版》发表的《关于重版书籍》一文，曾就三联书店所犯错误，具体指出了许多例证。三联上海办事处曾以公开信说明：“我们所称初版，是以三联这个单位第一次印行而言。”这理由是片面的，同时也不能解释更改书名这一更错误的事实（除了北京图书馆文中指出的《价值与剩余价值》与《经济学初步》外，我们还接到读者长春东北师大杜平先生来信指出三联版《哲学研习提纲》与前以实践出版社名义出版的《哲学初级研习提纲》，是同书的异名两印。）三联应该重视读物的历史观点，同时即为了照顾它本身过去的光辉历史，也应该在版权页上有详细的著录。这一问题不只涉及三联一家的出版物，我们希望一切公私营出版家都不要忽视这一问题。
    二、翻译书籍应该详细记明原本作者本名、国籍、原书出版年月、原书原文名称，也都是必要的。《现代世界民主运动史纲》一书，只在封面和扉页中出现了原本作者的中译名，有一篇译者序，对于原作者、原书出版年月及在何处出版，却无一字提及。《新越南》标明了原作者国籍，而原书哪一年出版的却找不着说明。写书的时间是该书内容的一根重要线索，忽视了这一点，定会影响到读者对著作的理解程度。
