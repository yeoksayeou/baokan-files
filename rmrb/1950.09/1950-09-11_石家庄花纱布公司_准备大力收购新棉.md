　　Shijiazhuang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company
    Prepares to Vigorously Purchase New Cotton
    [Report from this newspaper] New cotton has gradually entered the market in various cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province. Cotton yarn and cloth companies in Shijiazhuang and other places are fully prepared to vigorously launch purchasing work. To meet the arduous task of purchasing cotton this year, the Shijiazhuang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company began preparations in July, such as increasing institutions and planning to repair warehouses and open-air cotton storage sites. In mid-August, it was decided to add a Gaoyi branch company and nine purchasing groups in Luancheng, Zhengding, Lingshou, and other places to strengthen purchasing work in various places, and initially recruited 51 new cadres. A raw cotton technology research meeting was also held, which was of great educational significance to the cadres' thinking. For example, the following issues were resolved in the meeting from August 6th to 12th: 1. Technical tests were held, reaching a consensus on grading and inspection standards, and improving the level of technical theory. Some individual graders, who were arrogant in the past and thought their technology was good, failed the test in many cases. They deeply felt that they still need to learn with an open mind in order to meet the requirements of the work. Some business personnel, who used to see that the level of individual graders was low, had the wrong idea of not believing in science and technology. In this meeting, due to the exchange of experience, there was also a major change in viewpoints, recognizing the importance of science and technology. 2. In the past, lower-level graders and business personnel did not work well together, discriminated against each other, and looked down on each other. They all made profound self-criticisms at the meeting and discussed how to learn from each other in the future, unite closely, and achieve the smooth development of work. 3. They reviewed the deviations and shortcomings that occurred in the grading and inspection work in the past, and studied specific methods for future improvement. 4. Issues such as ginning, packing, and warehouse construction were raised. The resolution of these issues will directly affect the smooth development of future purchasing work. In late August, new cotton has been listed in Yuanshi, Gaoyi, and other places, and the Shijiazhuang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has actively organized purchases.
    In addition, after the new cotton was listed in the counties near Dingxing County in Baoding Prefecture, the Dingxing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company is also deploying cadres to various counties to strengthen procurement.

　　石家庄花纱布公司
    准备大力收购新棉
    【本报讯】河北省各棉产区新棉已逐渐上市。石家庄等地花纱布公司已充分准备大力展开收购工作。石家庄花纱布公司为迎接今年购棉的艰巨任务，七月份即开始进行准备工作，如增设机构，筹划补修仓库及露天存棉场所等。八月中旬已确定增设高邑支公司一处，增设栾城、正定、灵寿等九个收购小组以加强各地收购工作，并初步吸收了新干部五十一名。又召开了原棉技术研究会议，这对干部思想上的教育意义很大。如在八月六日到十二日的会议中，解决了以下几个问题：一、举行了技术测验，在分级检验标准上达到了认识的一致，提高了技术理论水平。某些个别分级人员，过去自高自大，以为技术不错，经测验不及格的很多，他们深感自己尚须虚心学习，才能适应工作的要求。又有些业务人员，过去看到个别分级人员水平低，便发生了不相信科学技术的错误思想。这次会议中，由于交流了经验，观点上亦有了大的转变，认识到科学技术的重要。二、过去下层分级人员与业务人员工作上结合不好，互相歧视，彼此瞧不起，在会上都作了深刻检讨。并讨论了今后互相学习，密切团结，达到工作顺利开展。三、检讨了过去分级检验工作发生的偏差与缺点，并研究今后改进的具体办法。四、提出了轧花、打包、建仓等问题。以上这些问题的解决，将直接影响今后收购工作的顺利开展。八月下旬，元氏、高邑等地新棉已有上市，石家庄花纱布公司已积极组织收购。
    又，保定专区定兴县附近各县新花上市后，定兴花纱布支公司亦正调配干部，分赴各县加强采购。
