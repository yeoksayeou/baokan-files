A Torrent of Heroes Flows to Beijing
    Our Newspaper's Collective Report

    The heroes and model workers from various regions who are attending the National Congress of Combat Heroes and the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers have arrived in Beijing yesterday. The heroes and model workers were warmly welcomed at the Beijing Railway Station. Before arriving in Beijing, they received enthusiastic greetings and farewells from military and government organs and people from all walks of life in the cities along the routes from Shenyang, Xi'an, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and other places to Beijing.

  Northeast Heroes and Role Models on the Way to the Pass
    On September 20th, the Northeast labor models who stand at the forefront of national economic construction and the Northeast combat heroes who guard the sacred border of the motherland gathered at Shenyang Railway Station to depart for Beijing. Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, Du Zheheng, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and representatives of various organs and organizations went to the station to see them off. Zhao Guoyou, the creator of new records, held Vice Chairman Lin Feng's hand tightly and thanked the well-wishers on behalf of more than 120 combat heroes and labor models, and led the shouting of slogans: "Workers, peasants, and soldiers unite, work hard to produce, and defend the border!" Vice Chairman Lin Feng and Zhao Guoyou and Ma Hengchang stood close together next to the locomotive and took a commemorative photo. The special train carrying the heroes and model workers moved forward slowly, and countless crowds surged to the vicinity of the train, shaking hands with the heroes and model workers repeatedly. A soldier in his forties ran breathlessly to the vicinity of the combat heroes' carriage and said to the combat heroes, "Be sure to say hello to Chairman Mao and wish Chairman Mao good health!"

    The train was surrounded by cheering crowds at every station it passed. Railway employees along the way saw the special train of heroes and model workers and hurriedly shouted around, "Where are Zhao Guoyou and Du Xianyang sitting?" "We want to see Zhao Guilan and Tian Guiying!" I personally heard a railway track worker say, "We want to see our nationally renowned heroes and model workers, so we finished our work early and rushed from more than two li away." As he spoke, he took out a commemorative notebook and asked the heroes and model workers to sign it for him. When he discovered that Zhao Guilan's name appeared in his notebook, he was so excited that he couldn't speak, staring blankly at her, holding her hands.

    The farewell meeting at Jinzhou Railway Station was truly an unforgettable scene. In front of a small platform, more than ten red flags fluttered in the wind, and the representatives of the Party, government, military, and people of Jinzhou raised thousands of arms towards the special train, shouting wildly: "Learn from the heroes and model workers!" They asked Zhao Guoyou and others to speak to them, and when they heard Liang Jun's speech, applause erupted. Railway employees found Tian Guiying and asked her to walk in front of the railway employees' team. As Tian Guiying walked, she was stopped by them, who asked her to speak to them. The people of Jinzhou gave their specialties—apples, pears, and their own cultivated flowers—to the heroes and model workers. When the train was far away, we still saw two teams of red and green yangko dancers twisting towards us, drumming and clapping their hands, and we could still hear the shouts of farewell until we could no longer see the station.

  East China Heroes and Role Models Head North via the Beijing-Shanghai Railway
    On the afternoon of September 18th, the heroes and model workers concentrated in the Shanghai and Nanjing areas departed separately. Before their departure, military and government circles and people's organizations in the two places held banquets to entertain them and raised their glasses to celebrate. The Shanghai heroes and model workers departed from Shanghai North Railway Station, while the Nanjing combat heroes crossed the river at Xiaguan and departed from Pukou. The people of both places welcomed them with gongs, drums, and firecrackers. On the 19th, the heroes and model workers from the two places arrived in Jinan separately and met with the heroes and model workers concentrated in Jinan. When the train arrived at Jinan Railway Station, the people who came to welcome them were already crowding the platform. Red flags fluttered in the air, and applause and cheers were mixed together. After getting off the train, a grand welcoming ceremony was held on the platform, and elementary school students lined up in two rows to present flowers to the heroes and model workers. During the two-day stay in Jinan, factories, schools, and troops invited Wei Laiguo, Li Landing, and other heroes to give speeches, with an audience of more than 10,000 people. The heroes and model workers also took the opportunity to visit Jinan's scenic spots such as Daming Lake, Pearl Spring, and the agricultural experiment station. When the reporter accompanied the heroes and model workers to visit Daming Lake, an old boatman praised the discipline and bravery of the People's Liberation Army to the extreme. He said: I am already over fifty years old this year, and I have seen many armies, but I have never seen an army as good as the People's Liberation Army. On the 21st, the East China heroes and model workers representatives were completely concentrated and immediately left Jinan by special train for Tianjin. On the 22nd, the heroes and model workers from the two major administrative regions of East China and Northeast China shook hands and met in Tianjin. They talked happily and felt that they had met too late. On the same day, the Tianjin military and government authorities bid farewell to them, hoping that the heroes and model workers representatives would better exchange experiences in Beijing, and Tianjin would accept their valuable experiences to promote various tasks. At the farewell meeting of all circles in Tianjin, Mayor Huang Jing delivered a farewell speech saying: "Combat heroes have made the greatest contributions in the revolutionary struggle to liberate our motherland and liberate the people of the whole country; labor models are the most active and most contributory in restoring and developing the production of the new China. Today, being able to come to Tianjin together, the people of our city are very excited and feel great glory." Mayor Huang also represented the people of Tianjin to wish the success of the Combat Heroes and Labor Models Representatives Conference. Zhao Guoyou, a labor model from the Northeast delegation, and Liu Kuiji, a combat hero from the East China delegation, delivered reply speeches successively, unanimously expressing their gratitude for the warm reception of the people of Tianjin and guaranteeing that they would work harder in the future to produce, consolidate national defense, and strive for the prosperity of the new China. After the farewell at the station, the heroes' train headed towards Beijing in cheers.

  On the Heroes' Train Departing from Hankou
    A special train of heroes, amidst the sound of farewell firecrackers, left Hankou and headed north.

    Along the way, every important station echoed with cheers and drums of farewell. Even in the quiet of the deep night, we often saw farewell crowds carrying bright lanterns. From Hankou to Beijing, the journey was as lively as the New Year. On Chaoyang Road in Shijiazhuang, an elderly man with white hair distributed bright bouquets to the heroes of the Second Field Army and the Fourth Field Army. When the old man handed the bouquets to the cars, the heroes were deeply moved: "The people are too good to us!"

    The enthusiasm of the people inspires the heroes' work enthusiasm. Zhao Xingyuan and Liu Meicun, the captain and vice-captain of the Fourth Field Army Heroes Team, were meticulously studying the draft of their speech at the conference. For the celebration article written for the first National Day, they planned to choose the topic: "My Year." Under this topic, they will write about how they went from the coldest Northeast to the hottest Qiongya. They will recall the scenes of overcoming diseases, famine, and conquering the ocean, using this experience of overcoming thousands of dangers and difficulties to tell the people that if the American imperialists dare to provoke a war, they will definitely be able to defeat it and bury it in the ocean.

    The club on the train was arranged by the staff of the Youth Cultural Train of the Ministry of Railways. In a decorated carriage, pictures, pictorials, and toys were set up for the heroes. Songs were broadcast during every meal. This made the heroes' long journey pleasant and comfortable. At the party held on the evening of the 20th, the staff of the Youth Cultural Train sang drum lyrics and recited clappers, which were urgently created, singing about Gao Yumei, the female hero of digging rivers in Central South China, and Liu Meicun, the combat hero. The Fourth Field Army heroes felt very close to the yangko opera "Good News" which described the Jinzhou battle. Guo Junqing, who had fought on the front line for five years, was a female combat hero who had just changed out of men's clothing not long ago. She sang a cheerful Shaanxi folk song for the evening. Liu Meicun's clapper represented all the heroes and role models to thank the people along the Beijing-Hankou line for their farewells. He said: "Passing one station after another, the train goes straight north. ...There are cannons and firecrackers, and foreign drums and horns are sounding happily. There are farewell meetings at every station, it's like celebrating the New Year every day. ...Thousands of words can't express enough, the people are too good to us! ...Our credit is nothing, the glory should belong to everyone. The heroes and role models have nothing else to say, they will repay with practical actions."

  Northwest Heroes and Role Models Respected Along the Way
    At 4 pm on the 19th, the Northwest heroes and role models set off for Beijing. For a while, the streets of Xi'an were already crowded with people seeing them off. It was raining, and people were stepping in the mud, and their clothes were wet, but they didn't seem to feel it, they were just eagerly waiting for the heroes and role models to appear, to get a glimpse of the heroes and role models' demeanor. When several floats carrying all 98 heroes and role models from the Northwest set off from the municipal government, cheers and gongs and drums rang out, and thousands of people waved to the heroes and role models.

    A farewell meeting was held in a short time at the station. Peng Dehuai, Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, braved the rain to attend. He repeatedly urged the heroes and role models to study well at the conference and unite the masses well. He pointed out that heroes have always emerged from the masses and should maintain close ties with the masses. Chairman Peng Dehuai had just feasted on the representatives the day before, and today he came to see them off again, which made the heroes and role models very moved. Before getting on the train, a team of elementary school students presented flowers to the heroes and role models. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Industry smiled and took a big red flower and put it on Comrade Zhao Zhankui. "Welcome the old hero to wear flowers!" "Salute to the old hero!" For a time, cheers rang out again.

    The train, full of glorious people, carrying the wishes and hopes of the people of the Northwest, slowly left the station amidst the melodious sound of military music.

    At each station along the way, there were people welcoming them everywhere, and refreshments were prepared for the heroes and role models everywhere, requesting to meet the heroes and role models one by one. Passing Zhengzhou on the 20th and arriving in Shijiazhuang on the morning of the 21st.

    During the welcome and farewell in Shijiazhuang, workers and students surrounded and followed the train of heroes and role models, lingering for a long time. They were familiar with the names of many heroes and role models. They could call out the names of the heroes and role models. Many combat heroes made great contributions during the liberation of Shijiazhuang. The people of Shijiazhuang have special feelings for the heroes. The heroes also have deep feelings for Shijiazhuang.

  A Happy Gathering of Heroes and Role Models from Ethnic Minorities
    When the train was about to leave Shijiazhuang, the students of Shijiazhuang Women's High School surrounded the train of the First Field Army combat heroes delegation. They used gongs and drums, and enthusiastic cheers, to ask Ashan of the Kazakh ethnic group to dance again and again.

    Ashan, a tall man, was once a commander of the Xinjiang National Army and now works in the Fifth Army of the People's Liberation Army. He said that without musical instruments, he could not dance, and he was very grateful for the enthusiasm of his comrades. The female students said, "If you don't dance, we welcome you to sing."

    Ashan walked out of the carriage, and the female students blew horns and beat drums to greet him. Ashan sang a folk song called "World" in Kazakh.

    "Hey, young people should move forward,
    Don't idle around with nothing to do,
    Don't fall behind everyone else,
    Continue to move forward."

    Another group of workers and students, they are asking Kerim, a labor model from Xinjiang, to dance. Kerim's solo dance of the Uyghur ethnic group won cheers from the farewell crowd.

    He Guoxiu, a labor model of the Mosi ethnic group from the Yunnan border, wherever she went, a group of people surrounded her. Nineteen-year-old He Guoxiu—a staunch fighter who loyally supported the Yunnan People's Guerrilla. On the train from Hankou to Beijing, she sang the Jin Fenghua song in the Mosi language more than once. Every time she sang "Looking today and looking tomorrow, looking until the old man sees the sun, following Chairman Mao, we will definitely turn ourselves over," her dark face was always filled with joy from the bottom of her heart.

    The heroes of Uyghur, Kazakh, Woni, Axi, and Mosi ethnic groups exchanged commemorative albums and wrote their names. Some of them sat together and talked about their lives. Pu Enzhao, a maritime combat hero of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, is a fellow villager of He Guoxiu. After they met, Pu Enzhao said: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can ethnic minorities have true equality." He Guoxiu said: "If there were no Communist Party, the Mosi people would not know how much suffering they would have to endure."

    Inside the carriage, outside the carriage, a burst of cheers. Brothers and sisters of all ethnic groups in our country are truly living happily in a big family today.

  Heroes from All Roads Meet in Fengtai
    When the combat heroes from Northeast, North China, Northwest, Central South, and Southwest China arrived in Fengtai almost at the same time, it was truly a grand meeting of national heroes. Liu Meicun, a combat hero of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, and Wei Laiguo, a sharpshooter of the Third Field Army, shook hands tightly as soon as they met. Liu Meicun asked Wei Laiguo: "Did you receive the letter I sent you?" Wei Laiguo said with a smile: "I received the photos of your naval training and your combat in Hainan Island." These two members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also met in Beijing at this time last year, and they have been separated for almost a year now. Li Landing, a model medical worker of the Third Field Army, and Ding Zhihui, a model medical worker of the Second Field Army, also used this short time to talk about the situation after their separation. Zhao Xingyuan, a comprehensive meritorious servant of the Fourth Field Army, held the hands of an old comrade who had fought and worked together in the past, and who is now in the Third Field Army. The two almost jumped up when they met. Liu Kuiji and Li Guangzheng, who participated in the National Youth Congress in Beijing last year, are now in East China and Central South China respectively.

  Heroes and Role Models from All Roads Arrive in the Capital
    When the Mao Zedong locomotive flying the five-star red flag pulled the combat heroes and labor models from all roads of the country into Beijing Railway Station from Fengtai, a deafening sound of military music and cheers rang out. Standing at the forefront of the crowd welcoming at the station were the heads of military and government units of the Central People's Government and the leaders of various people's organizations. They applauded happily to welcome the train carrying the heroes and role models to the capital.

    This train truly deserves to be called the heroes and role models train. A portrait of Chairman Mao was mounted in front of the locomotive, and the golden frame was surrounded by brand-new red flags, red stars, and flowers. The entire locomotive was freshly painted by the heroes of the Mao Zedong, making it particularly beautiful. The driver is the famous old hero Li Yong. The trains behind carried the most outstanding and most excellent heroes and role model figures from the Northwest, Southwest, Central South, East China, and Northeast and North China. These include Zhang Yingcai, the Iron Battalion Commander, Liu Zilin, who led a class to annihilate a division of the enemy, Lu Shunbao, who wore two Special Merit Medals and four Great Merit Medals on his chest, Zhao Zhankui, the worker banner, Zhao Guoyou, the founder of the new record movement, Rong Guanxiu, the mother of the soldiers, and Wei Laiguo, the combat hero famous in East China. Among these nearly a thousand heroes and role models, some have dozens of knife and bullet wounds on their bodies; some have killed their way out of certain death; some are already partially disabled and still insist on their glorious combat posts; some have become ill from years of hard work, day and night. However, no shadow of pain or fatigue can be found on their faces. When they carried the banner of heroes and model workers and appeared on the platform with strong steps, their faces were filled with irrepressible joyful smiles. They walked through the strong aperture of the movie camera, and colorful paper fluttered on their heads, shoulders, and clothes, making them even stronger and more glorious.

    Outside the station, in the square, the dark crowds, holding countless red flags, waved their arms as hard as they could and cheered in unison, welcoming the arrival of the heroes and role models. Deputy Premier Dong and other military and government leaders, as well as the leaders of people's organizations, in short and enthusiastic welcome speeches, unanimously hoped that the heroes and role models, after exchanging experiences, would give more play to revolutionary heroism, completely drive out the American imperialists, eliminate the Chiang bandits, liberate Taiwan, and exert greater brilliance on the construction road of the new China. In their reply speeches, the representatives of the heroes and role models answered everyone loudly: they will work harder to realize everyone's hopes for them and always maintain the glory bestowed by Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country.

    In the brilliant electric light, teams of young children gave handfuls of flowers to the heroes and role models. A child happily told the heroes and role models: "You are going to see Chairman Mao!" The excitement and joyful smiles of the heroes and role models were indescribable.

　　英雄的洪流流向北京
    本报记者集体报道
    出席全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的各区英雄、模范们，已于昨日抵达北京。英雄、模范们在北京车站受到热烈的欢迎。他们在到达北京前，在由沈阳、西安、上海、南京、汉口等地到北京的道路上，受到了沿路各城市的军政机关和各阶层人民热诚的迎送。
  东北英模在进关途中
    九月二十日，站在全国经济建设最前面的东北劳动模范和警卫祖国神圣边疆的东北战斗英雄，齐集在沈阳车站向北京出发了。东北人民政府林枫副主席，东北总工会张维桢主席，农林部杜者蘅部长及各机关团体代表均前往车站欢送。新纪录创始者赵国有紧握着林枫副主席的手，代表一百二十多名战斗英雄、劳动模范向欢送者致谢，并领头高呼口号：“工农兵团结起来，努力生产，保卫边疆！”林枫副主席和赵国有、马恒昌紧紧靠着站在火车头旁边拍了一张纪念照片。专车载着英模们徐徐向前，无数的人群涌到车的近边，和英模们一再握手。有位四十多岁的战士气喘喘地跑到战斗英雄的车厢附近，对战斗英雄们说：“你们千万要向毛主席问好，祝福毛主席健康！”
    车过每个车站，都被欢送的人群围得紧紧的。沿途铁路员工看见了英模们的专车，急急忙忙地四处呼喊：“赵国有、杜先扬坐在那里？”“我们要看看赵桂兰和田桂英！”我亲自听见一位铁路修道工人说：“咱要想见见咱们全国闻名的英雄模范，咱提前把工作做好，从两里多地赶来。”说着他就掏出了纪念本子，找英模们给他签字。当他发现在他本子上出现了赵桂兰的名字，他激动得说不出话来，呆呆地看着她，握着她的双手。
    锦州车站的欢送会，真是难忘的一幕。在一个不大的月台前面，十来面红旗迎风招展，锦州的党、政、军、民的代表，向着专车举着千百双手臂，狂呼：“向英模们学习！”他们要求赵国有等给他们讲话，当他们听到梁军代表讲话时，掌声轰然而起。铁路员工们找到了田桂英，要她到铁路员工的队伍面前走一走，田桂英一面走，一面被他们拉住，要她给他们讲话。锦州的人民把他们的特产——苹果、梨子，和他们自己栽的鲜花赠送给英模。当列车走得很远时，还看见两队红红绿绿的秧歌队向着我们扭来，敲着鼓，拍着掌，一直到看不见车站时，还听到欢送的呼喊声。
  华东英模由京沪路北上
    九月十八日下午，集中于沪宁两区的英模分别出发，临行前，两地军政各界及人民团体设宴招待，举杯庆祝。上海英模自上海北站出发，南京战斗英雄则于下关渡江自浦口出发，两地人民均打着锣鼓燃起鞭炮欢送。十九日两地英模分别抵达济南，与在济南集中的英模会合，当列车行至济南车站时，赶来欢迎的人早已在月台上挤得满满的了，红旗在空中飘扬，掌声与欢呼声混成一团。下车后，即在月台上举行隆重的欢迎会，小学生排成两行依次向英模献花。在济南停留两日，各工厂学校部队，纷纷邀请魏来国，李蓝丁等英雄讲演，听众达一万余人。英雄模范们并乘兴游览济南名胜大明湖，珍珠泉及农事试验场等。当记者随同英模游览大明湖时，一个老船夫极口夸讲解放军的纪律和英勇。他说：我今年已是五十多岁的人，见过很多的军队从未有像解放军这样好的军队。二十一日华东英模代表已完全集中，当即离开济南乘专车赴天津。至二十二日华东及东北两大行政区英模在天津握手会晤，他们互相欢快畅谈，觉得相见太晚。当日天津军政当局向他们饯别时，希望英模代表到北京能更好地交流经验，天津将接受他们的宝贵经验，来推进各种工作。在天津各界的欢送会上黄敬市长致欢送词说：“战斗英雄们是在解放我们祖国、解放全国人民的革命斗争中功劳最大的；劳动模范们是在恢复与发展新中国的生产上最积极、最有贡献的，今天能够一齐来到天津，我们全市人民非常兴奋，感到莫大光荣”。黄市长并代表天津市人民祝战斗英雄、劳动模范代表会议的成功。东北代表团劳动模范赵国有、华东代表团战斗英雄刘奎基先后致答词，一致对津市人民的热烈招待表示感谢，并保证今后更加努力生产、巩固国防、为新中国的富强而奋斗。在车站话别后，英雄的列车便在欢呼声中向北京驶去。
  在从汉口动身的英雄列车上
    一列英雄的专车，在欢送的鞭炮声中，开出汉口，驶向北方。
    一路上，每一个重要车站，都响动着欢送的欢呼声和锣鼓声。即令在静寂的深夜里，也常常看到提着明亮灯笼的欢送人群。从汉口到北京，沿途真像新年样的热闹。在石家庄的朝阳路上，一位白发的老者，把鲜丽的花束分献给二野、四野的英雄们。当老者把花束递上汽车的时候，英雄们深深地受了感动：“人民对我们太好了！”
    人民的热情鼓舞着英雄们的工作热情。第四野战军英雄队的正副队长赵兴元、刘梅村，细致地推敲着大会发言的稿子。给第一届国庆节写的庆祝文章，他们打算选择的题目是：“我的一年”。在这个题目下面，他们将写出他们如何从最严冷的东北，走向了酷热的琼崖。他们将回忆战胜疾病、粮荒以及征服海洋的情景，以这战胜千险万难的经历告诉人民，美帝国主义者如果胆敢挑动战争，他们就一定能击败它，把它埋葬在海洋里。
    列车上的俱乐部是铁道部青年文化列车的工作人员布置的。在一辆扎彩的车厢里，为英雄们设置了图片、画报和玩具。每当进餐的时候，有歌曲放送。这使得英雄们的长途生活，愉快而舒适。二十日夜晚举行的联欢会上，青年文化列车的工作人员，演唱了突击创作的大鼓并说了快板，歌唱的是中南挖河女英雄高玉梅，战斗英雄刘梅村。描写锦州战役的秧歌剧《喜报》，四野的英雄们感到十分亲切。战斗在前线五年的郭俊卿，她是一位女战斗英雄，刚刚换下男装不久，她为晚会唱了一支愉快的陕北小调。刘梅村的快板代表全体英模答谢京汉沿线人民的欢送。他说道：“过一站，又一站，火车一直往北贯。……又是炮，又是鞭，洋鼓洋号响得欢。站站都有欢送会，简直天天像过年。……千言万语说不尽，人民对我们太好了！……我们的功劳不算啥，光荣应该归大家。英模没有别的话说，实际行动来报答。”
  西北英雄模范一路受尊敬
    十九日下午四时西北的英雄模范们动身赴京，一时左右，西安市的大街上已经挤满了欢送的人群。天在下雨，人们踏在泥浆里，衣服都淋湿了，但他们似乎都没有感觉到，只是在切盼着英雄模范的出现，一瞻英雄模范丰采。当几辆花车载着全西北九十八位英雄模范从市政府开出的时候，欢呼声锣鼓声响成一片，千万人在向英雄模范们招手。
    在车站上很短的时间内，举行了一个欢送会，西北军政委员会彭德怀主席冒雨赶来参加。他再三嘱咐英雄模范们，在大会上应当很好地学习，并很好地团结群众。并指出，从来英雄们就是从群众中产生出来的，应当密切联系群众的。彭德怀主席在前一天刚刚欢宴了各位代表，今天又赶来欢送，这使英雄模范们都非常感动。上车前，一队队小学生给英雄模范们献花，工业部王部长笑着也拿了一朵大红花给赵占魁同志戴上。“欢迎老英雄戴花！”“向老英雄致敬！”一时又欢呼声四起。
    列车满载着光荣的人们，载着西北人民的心愿、希望，在军乐悠扬声中徐徐开出了车站。
    沿途各站到处都是欢迎的人们，到处为英雄模范预备了茶点，要求和英雄模范们一一见面。二十日过郑州，二十一日晨到达石家庄。
    在石家庄的欢迎和欢送当中，工人们、学生们，围着，随着英雄模范们的列车，久久地不离，不少的英雄模范的名字，他们是熟悉的。他们可以呼出英雄模范的名字来。不少的战斗英雄，在解放石家庄的时候立过大功。石家庄的人民是对英雄们有特殊感情的。英雄们对石家庄也同样有着深厚感情。
  少数民族英雄模范们的欢聚
    火车将要开出石家庄的时候，石家庄女中的学生们围住了第一野战军战斗英雄代表团的那节列车。她们用锣鼓，用热烈的欢呼，一次又一次地要求哈萨克族的阿山跳舞。
    阿山，高大的个子，曾经是新疆民族军的指挥员，现在在人民解放军第五军工作。他表示没有乐器，不能跳舞，对于同志们的热情，非常感谢。女学生们都说：“不跳舞，我们欢迎你唱歌。”
    阿山走出车厢，女学生们吹起号打起鼓迎接了他。阿山唱了一个在哈萨克名叫“世界”的民歌。
    “哎，青年们要往前迈进，
    不要闲游无事无工，
    不要落在众人之后，
    继续的向前迈进。”
    另外的一群职工和学生们，他们在要求新疆的劳动模范克里木跳舞。维吾尔族的克里木的单人舞获得了欢送行列的喝彩。
    来自云南边境摩西族的劳动模范和国秀，他走到那里，那里就有一群人将她团团围住。十九岁的和国秀——一个忠诚支援云南人民游击队的坚强战士。在从汉口到北京的车上，她不止一次地用摩西族的语言唱着金凤花歌。她每次唱到“今天望来明天望，望到老天出太阳，跟着毛主席，一定把身翻。”的时候，她黑黝黝的脸上，总是洋溢着发自内心的喜悦。
    维吾尔族、哈萨克族、窝尼族、阿西族、摩西族的英雄们，他们都交换着纪念册，写上自己的名字。他们有的坐在一起，畅谈着自己的生活。人民解放军第四野战军的海上战斗英雄蒲恩昭，是和国秀的同乡，他们见面以后，蒲恩昭说：“只有在共产党的领导下，少数民族才能有真正的平等。”和国秀说：“要是没有共产党，摩西族人不知还要受多大的苦。”
    车厢里，车厢外，一片欢呼声。我国各民族的兄弟姊妹们，今天是真正欢乐的生活在一个大家庭里了。
  各路英模在丰台会了师
    当东北、华北、西北、中南、西南的各路战斗英雄，几乎在同一个时间到达丰台的时候，真正是全国英雄大会师。人民解放军第四野战军战斗英雄刘梅村和第三野战军的神枪手魏来国一见面就紧紧地握住了手。刘梅村问魏来国：“我给你的信收到了没有？”魏来国笑着说：“你们海上练兵和你在海南岛作战的照片都收到了。”这两位全国人民政协的委员，去年也是在这个时候在北京见了面，现在已经分手快一年了。第三野战军的模范医务工作者李兰丁和第二野战军的模范医务工作者丁志辉，她们也在利用这个短促的时间叙说了别离后的情况。第四野战军的全面功臣赵兴元，他双手拉着一个过去在一块战斗过和工作过的，现在在第三野战军的老同志，两个人见了面几乎跳起来。同于去年在北京参加全国青年代表大会的刘奎基和李广正，他们现在一个是在华东；一个在中南。
  各路英雄模范到达首都
    飘扬着五星红旗的毛泽东号机车拉着全国各路的战斗英雄与劳动模范从丰台进入北京车站的时候，喧天的军乐声与欢呼声响成一片。到站欢迎的人群的前列，站着中央人民政府各单位军政首长，和各人民团体领袖，他们欢欣地鼓掌欢迎载着英雄模范的列车到达首都。
    这一列车真配称英雄模范列车。车头前面装着毛主席像，黄金色的像框旁边是崭新的红旗、红星和花朵。全部机车全经毛泽东号的英雄们之手上了新漆，显得格外漂亮。司机是著名全国的老英雄李永。后面的列车里载着西北、西南、中南、华东与东北、华北的最出色，最优秀的英雄模范人物。其中包括钢铁营长张英才、率领一个班歼灭敌人一个师的刘子林、胸前挂着两个特功奖章与四个大功奖章的吕顺保、工人旗帜赵占魁、新纪录运动的创始者赵国有、子弟兵的母亲戎冠秀、闻名华东的战斗英雄魏来国。这近千的英雄模范中，有的身上带着数十处刀伤与弹伤；有的是在必死的情况下杀出了生路；有的已经半残废还在坚持着光荣的战斗岗位；有的因为连年累月、日以继夜地劳动，现已积劳成疾。但是，在他们的脸上完全找不到苦痛与疲乏的影子。他们扛着英模大旗，走着健壮的步子出现在站台的时候，脸上都浮着不能抑止的愉悦的笑容。他们从电影机的强烈的光圈前面走过，五彩的纸纷飞向他们的头上、肩上和衣衫上，更显得坚强、光彩。
    车站外面的广场上，黑压压的人群，举着数不清的红旗，尽力挥动着手臂，齐声欢呼，迎接英雄模范们的到来。董副总理和其他军政首长，以及人民团体的领袖在简短热情的欢迎词中，一致希望英雄模范们经过交流经验，更加发挥革命的英雄主义，彻底驱逐美帝，消灭蒋匪，解放台湾，并在新中国的建设大道上发挥更大的光辉。英雄模范的代表在答词中响亮的回答大家：他们将更加努力，实现大家对他们的希望，永远保持毛主席与全国人民所赐与的光荣。
    辉煌的电光中，一队队的青年儿童将大把大把的鲜花送给英模们。一个孩子高兴地告诉英模们：“你们要看到毛主席啦！”英模们那兴奋、那喜悦的微笑是难以形容了。
