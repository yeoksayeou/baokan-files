Editor's Note: After the People's Daily published a news item on page 2 on August 12 concerning the Datong Office of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry's Management Department neglecting flood prevention, resulting in the loss of 2,000 tons of coal, the director of the office, Liu Wending, conducted a self-criticism. Below is his letter:

Editor:

Regarding the incident of neglecting flood prevention and losing 2,000 tons of coal, I bear the primary responsibility. The main reason for this loss is that I thought at the time that coal sales were low during this off-season, and with the agricultural busy season approaching, the number of carts would decrease. Furthermore, the mine was not only not reducing production but increasing it daily, which I perceived as the Mining Bureau deliberately making things difficult for the office. At the same time, I believed that the responsibility for the coal's safekeeping still belonged to the Mining Bureau since it was still at the plant, so I did not actively find ways to transport it quickly, causing unnecessary losses to national assets.

Secondly, although my office notified the Baidong Station on June 3 to clear all coal stored at the mines belonging to Wajinwan by the 15th, we did not consider that there was a lot of coal stored there, and the plant area was small, unable to accommodate many vehicles. At the same time, we also failed to assign a dedicated person to personally check the coal transportation work, only using phone calls to coordinate and direct. After the stored coal was washed away by mountain floods, our leading cadres, due to continuous rainy days, also did not personally go to the coal plants to check, nor did we study how to overcome difficulties and transport the coal in a timely manner. If this bureaucratic work style of not going deep into the grassroots and not valuing national and people's assets is not overcome, it will cause even greater losses to state property.

After 300 tons of coal stored in Xingergou were washed away by mountain floods on June 17, a certain army unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed there suggested to the mine to build a ditch to prevent mountain floods. However, my office did not pay attention to this valuable suggestion, nor did we take timely measures to transport the coal, which resulted in another 1,600 tons of stored coal being washed away by mountain floods on the 28th and 29th. In fact, there were sufficient conditions to transport the stored coal out within these ten days.

In order to avoid the recurrence of similar mistakes, in addition to requesting the superior to give me the deserved punishment, I also put forward suggestions for improvement in the future: 1. Combine with the rectification movement to rectify the thinking of leading cadres, overcome subjectivism and departmentalism, and correct the bureaucratic and formalistic work style of only issuing instructions without checking the work. 2. Rectify the organizational structure, strengthen democratic management, and establish a level-by-level responsibility system to avoid the recurrence of accidents. 3. Strengthen business leadership, strengthen cadre learning, and improve the political level and business work ability of cadres.

### 忽视防洪损煤二千吨事件  刘文定同志来信检讨

　　忽视防洪损煤二千吨事件
    刘文定同志来信检讨
    编者按：八月十二日本报二版发表了中央燃料工业部经理司大同办事处忽视防洪，损煤二千吨的消息后，该办事处主任刘文定即进行了检讨。下面是他的来信：
    编辑同志：
    关于忽视防洪，损煤二千吨的事件，我要负主要责任。造成这次损失的原因，主要是我当时认为在这淡月的时候，销煤不多，并且农忙将届，大车减少，而矿方不但不减少产量，且逐日增加，这是矿务局故意与办事处为难。同时我认为煤尚在厂，保管责任属于矿务局，因而没有积极设法迅速运输，使国家资财受到不应有的损失。
    其次，我处虽于六月三日通知白洞站将挖金湾所属各矿存煤于十五日以前一律拉清，但没有考虑该处存煤很多，厂面狭小，不能容纳多数车辆；同时亦未责成专人亲往检查运煤工作，只用电话联系指挥。而在存煤被山洪冲走以后，我们领导干部因连日阴雨，又未亲到各处煤厂检查，也没研究应如何克服困难、及时疏运。这种不深入下层、不重视国家人民资财的官僚主义作风如不加以克服，将使国家财产遭受到更大的损失。
    在六月十七日杏儿沟存煤被山洪冲去三百吨以后，驻该地人民解放军某军曾向矿方建议建筑水沟，以防山洪。但我处对这宝贵意见未加重视，也没及时设法疏运，以致二十八、九两日，存煤又被山洪冲去一千六百余吨。其实，在这十余天内，将存煤运出是有足够条件的。
    为了避免类似错误的继续发生，我除请求上级给我应得的处分外，并提出今后改进意见：一、结合整风运动，整顿领导干部思想，克服主观主义与本位主义思想，纠正只发指示不检查工作的文牍主义和官僚主义作风。二、整顿组织机构，加强民主管理，建立逐级负责制，以避免事故的再度发生。三、加强业务领导，加强干部学习，提高干部的政治水平和业务工作能力。
    刘文定
