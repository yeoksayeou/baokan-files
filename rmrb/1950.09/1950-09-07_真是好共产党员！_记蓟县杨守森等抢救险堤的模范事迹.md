    "Truly Good Communist Party Members!"
    A Record of the Model Deeds of Yang Shousen and Others from Jixian County in Rescuing a Perilous Dike
    Wang Lijun
    Yang Shousen (village head and Communist Party branch secretary), Yang Baoli (Communist Party branch security committee member), and Yang Baolin (farmers' association director and Communist Party member), cadres from Dayanggezhuang Village, Eleventh District, Jixian County, Hebei Province, demonstrated the high sense of responsibility of Communist Party members, leading the masses in actively preventing floods and carrying out emergency rescues. They successfully overcame floods three times, preventing dike breaches and disasters, and received commendation from the Jixian County Flood Control Headquarters and verbal awards from the county Party committee.

    In late May, when Dayanggezhuang received its flood control assignment, village head Yang Shousen immediately gathered all the villagers to discuss organizing flood prevention efforts. He told everyone, "Protecting the dikes from breaching is the only way to protect our lives and property. It's the only way we'll have food to eat and clothes to wear." His words touched everyone's hearts, and the entire village responded enthusiastically. Yang Baoli, the Communist Party branch security committee member, Yang Baolin, the farmers' association director, Guo Shangwen, the security officer, and fourteen other Party member cadres were the first to sign up for the rescue team, motivating the masses to eagerly join the flood control organization. Seventy-five able-bodied young men with swimming skills and experience in flood prevention and rescue immediately volunteered for the rescue team; one hundred and seventeen able-bodied young men signed up for the standby team; and more than three hundred men and women, young and old, joined the reserve team. They proposed the slogan "Protect the dike as if protecting our lives," unanimously expressing their determination to protect the dike and prevent it from breaching. The Communist Party members all said, "We Party members must take the lead. Under any circumstances, we must ensure that there are no breaches." To facilitate leadership, the seventy-five rescue team members were divided into three teams based on voluntary principles. Yang Shousen was selected as the overall captain, and Yang Baolin, Yang Baoli, Guo Shangwen, and others were selected as team captains. Below the team level, there were subgroups for earthwork, pile driving, and carpentry. The standby and reserve teams were also divided into subgroups, and leaders were democratically elected to lead everyone in going to the dike on time. In addition, clear regulations were established for division of responsibilities: the rescue team was responsible for repairing dangerous dikes and plugging leaks; the standby team was responsible for patrolling the dikes; and the reserve team was responsible for transporting flood control materials and carrying earth. After the meeting, seven flood watch posts were set up along the village's 1,279 zhang dike section, with fourteen young men volunteering as flood watchmen.

    From late May to now, for three months, the Jiyun River has repeatedly risen, with three major floods. After the rain on May 25th and 26th, the Jiyun River rose, and Yang Shousen and others led the rescue team, standby team, and reserve team to the dike. They adopted a method of assigning responsibility by section. Yang Shousen and Yang Baoli led two rescue teams to guard the dangerous dike in the village; Yang Baolin led one rescue team to guard the new dike south of the village; and Guo Shangwen led the standby team to patrol the long dike. By June 3rd, the water level was only three inches from the top of the dike, and the entire village dike section faced a crisis. The dangerous dike north of the village was particularly threatened, with more than eighty zhang of the dike being heavily impacted by the floodwaters. Large chunks of dike soil were collapsing, and rainwater had accumulated in pits outside the dike, causing the dike roots inside and out to be eroded by water, and the soil had become soft mud. In such an emergency, Yang Shousen, Yang Baoli, and others set an example, constantly motivating the entire village, insisting on protecting the dike for six days and six nights without sleep. Yang Shousen constantly patrolled back and forth, repeatedly telling everyone, "The lives and property of more than a hundred villages depend on us. If we are even slightly negligent, it will lead to a major disaster." On the night of June 3rd, a leak appeared in the dangerous dike north of the village, and Yang Shousen immediately led more than three hundred civilians to plug it. Because of the lack of materials, he mobilized the masses to contribute sacks and mats to block the leak.

    On July 17th, the Jiyun River rose again, and Yang Shousen, Yang Baoli, and others led the rescue team to the dike in the rain. At night, Yang Baoli and others discovered a leak measuring one chi wide and one chi long in the dangerous dike north of the village. The water was flowing fiercely, and the masses were very anxious. Yang Baoli selflessly jumped into the water to feel for the leak. Communist Party members Yang Shouyi, Yang Fulai, Yang Zhenshen, Yang Fuhai, and others successively jumped into the water to use earth-filled sacks to block the leak. The next morning, a breach more than one chi wide and more than five chi long opened in the southern section of the dangerous dike, and the water gushed out more than five chi high, threatening to cause a disaster. At this critical moment, Yang Baoli, Yang Ziheng, and Cheng Chunhe, regardless of their own lives, immediately lay down at the breach, using their bodies to block the river water. Yang Shousen immediately led more than three hundred people to rush to plug the breach (Li Sen, the Party secretary of nearby Liuzongbing Village, also brought thirty-nine people to assist). They battled the flood for more than ten hours before plugging the breach. The masses were moved and said, "These people are truly good Communist Party members; without them, our houses and crops would have been flooded." After the water receded, Yang Shousen and others mobilized the entire village to repair the dangerous dike, completing three thousand earthworks in five days.

    “真是好共产党员！”
    记蓟县杨守森等抢救险堤的
    模范事迹
    王立钧
    河北省蓟县十一区大杨各庄村干部杨守森（村长、兼中共支部书记）、杨保礼（中共支部保卫委员）、杨宝林（农会主任、中共党员）等，发扬了共产党员的高度负责的精神，领导群众积极防汛抢险，三次战胜洪水，防止了决堤成灾，获得蓟县防汛指挥部的通报表扬和县委的口头奖励。
    五月下旬，当大杨各庄接到防汛任务后，村长杨守森马上召集全村群众商量组织防汛的事情。他向大家说：“保住堤埝不决口，才能保住咱们的生命财产，咱们才能有饭吃、有衣穿。”他这些话打动了每个人的心，全村人都积极响应。中共支部保卫委员杨保礼、农会主任杨宝林、治安员郭尚文等十四名党员干部，首先报名参加抢险队，带动群众热烈报名参加防汛组织。七十五名会泅水、对防汛抢险有经验的青壮年，当即自动报名参加抢险队；一百十七名青壮年男子报名参加了常备队；三百多名男女老少参加了后备队。大家提出“保埝如保命”的口号，一致表示下决心保护堤埝，使它不决口。共产党员们都说：“咱们党员要起带头作用。在任何情况下，一定要保证不决口。”为了便于领导，七十五名抢险队员，根据自愿原则编成三个分队；选出杨守森为总队长，杨宝林、杨保礼、郭尚文等为分队长。队以下又分成土工、桩工、木工小组。常备队和后备队也分成小组，用民主方式选出组长，负责带领大家按时上埝。此外又明确规定分工负责办法：抢险队负责修险堤、堵漏洞；常备队负责巡视堤埝；后备队负责搬运防汛器材和抬土。会后，全村一千二百七十九丈长的埝段，设立了七个汛铺，有十四名青壮年自动当汛工。
    从五月下旬到现在，三个月来，蓟运河连次涨水，其中最大的有三次。五月二十五、二十六日下雨后，蓟运河水上涨，杨守森等便带领抢险队、常备队、后备队上埝。他们采取了分段负责的方法，杨守森、杨保礼带领两个抢险队守护村上险堤；杨宝林带领一个抢险队守护村南新堤；郭尚文领着常备队在长埝上巡视。到六月三日，水位离埝顶只有三寸，全村埝段面临危机，特别是村北险堤更为危险，有八十余丈长的堤段被洪流冲击得很厉害，堤土大块的往下坍落，堤外也因下雨积成水坑，埝根内外被水浸蚀，土已泡成软泥。在这样紧急的情况下，杨守森、杨保礼等以身作则，始终积极带动全村群众，六天六夜坚持护堤，没有睡眠。杨守森不断来回巡视，再三嘱咐大家：“一百多个村庄的生命财产，都靠着我们。如果我们稍一疏忽，便要酿成巨灾。”六月三日夜间，村北险堤有了一个漏子，杨守森马上带领三百多个民工前往抢堵。因为物料缺乏，他就发动群众拿出麻袋、席子，将漏子堵好。
    七月十七日蓟运河水再次上涨，杨守森、杨保礼等带领抢险队冒雨上埝。夜间，杨保礼等发现村北险堤被冲开一个长宽各一尺的漏洞；水流的很凶，群众非常着急。杨保礼就奋不顾身地跳到水中，去摸漏洞。共产党员杨守义、杨福来、杨振善、杨福海等相继跳下水去，用装着土的麻袋去堵漏洞。第二天早晨，险堤南段又开了一个一尺多宽、五尺多长的决口，水窜出五尺多高，眼看就要成灾。在这紧急关头，杨保礼、杨子恒、程春和三人，不顾自己性命，立刻躺在决口处，用身子挡住河水。杨守森马上带领三百多人跑来抢堵（附近的刘总兵庄支书李森，也带着三十九人跑来协助）。他们与洪水搏斗了十个多钟头才把决口堵好。群众都感动地说：“这些人真是好共产党员；没有他们，咱们的房子、庄稼全得淹了。”水落后，杨守森等又动员全村群众抢修险堤，五天完成了三千土方的任务，
