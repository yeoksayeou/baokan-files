　　People from All Walks of Life Continue to Express Opinions
    Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's Protest Against the United States
    [Report from this newspaper] People from all walks of life in Beijing continue to protest the crimes of American planes invading our country's airspace and killing our compatriots.
    Citizens of the Eighth District unanimously expressed their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, demanding that the United States compensate our country for its losses and severely punish the perpetrators. Xiao Zhongxin, a worker at the private Cihua Factory, said: "We, the liberated Chinese people, will never allow imperialism to continue to run rampant in China's territory, airspace, and territorial waters. We must strike back against the aggressors. We will step up production, work hard on construction, and continue to launch the peace signature campaign to show our strength and stop the American imperialist aggression." Workers whose families are in the countryside said that they would immediately write home to call on their relatives and friends to sign the peace declaration.
    The Educational Workers' Congress of the Twelfth District issued a circular telegram, firmly supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement. They unanimously expressed that they would extensively carry out propaganda against American imperialist aggression in the countryside, expand the peace signature campaign, and fully support the liberation of Taiwan to respond to the provocative behavior of American imperialism.
    Four representatives of the People's Representative Conference of the Third District, Liu Zhanwu, Wang Zuolin, Liu Deyou, and Jiang Xiuyan, wrote to the Third District Office, saying in their letter: "American imperialism's invasion of Korea is completely unreasonable. We firmly support the Korean people's just war for the independence and freedom of their country. The American air force's unreasonable intrusion into our country's airspace and the strafing of our country's peaceful residents are completely planned provocative acts. We feel extremely indignant. We fully agree with Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement. We are willing to solemnly warn American imperialism that if it dares to continue to engage in unreasonable aggression, we will unite like steel and definitely give the aggressors a big nail."
    Liu Jinrong, a resident of Liulangzhuang in the western suburbs who was recently selected as a model worker for the entire suburban area, said: "If American planes come, won't they just run into a nail? We farmers will step up production, so that the front-line Liberation Army can eat their fill. If the American soldiers dare to come again, we will definitely drive them back!"
    Citizen Liu Jinghe wrote to this newspaper, expressing that he is determined to study hard, work hard, and support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement with practical actions.
