　　Soviet Foreign Cultural Association Holds Lecture
    Qian Sanqiang Speaks on Atomic Energy and its Applications
    Today, September 24th, in 1949, TASS issued a statement under instruction that the Soviet Union had atomic weapons as early as 1947. The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association, in commemoration of this day (because this statement greatly consolidated world peace and frightened war mongers into panic and utter disarray), will hold a lecture at 7:30 PM this afternoon at 19 Nanheyan Street. Qian Sanqiang will speak on "Atomic Energy and its Applications." All those holding admission tickets or long-term lecture passes from the Soviet introduction may attend.

　　苏对外文协举行讲演会
    钱三强讲原子能及其应用
    一九四九年的今天（二十四日）塔斯社奉命声明苏联早在一九四七年就有原子武器，北京市中苏友好协会与苏联对外文化协会为纪念这个日子，（因为这个声明大大巩固了世界的持久和平，使战争贩子吓得张惶失措，狼狈不堪。）特于今日下午七时半在南河沿十九号举行讲演会，请钱三强讲：“原子能及其应用”。凡持有入场券或苏联介绍长期听讲证者，届时均可前往听讲。              （陈应楠）
