　　Defending Peace
    ——Editorial from the Soviet Pravda
    The Second World Peace Congress is only two months away. Hundreds of millions of people defending peace are greeting this congress by strengthening their struggle against the imperialist warmongers and striving for peace throughout the world.
    To further expand the mass base of the peace front, to elevate the peace movement to a new stage, to expand the demands for peaceful struggle in the program – these are the tasks that millions of peace supporters in various countries are now setting for themselves.
    One of the most glorious and exciting events in people's lives is the continuous strengthening and expansion of the nationwide movement to defend peace and oppose the imperialist warmongers. Never in history has there been such a large-scale, truly nationwide movement as the peace movement. The lofty ideal of defending peace from the danger of a new war prepared by the American and British imperialist aggressors unites all progressive forces of mankind.
    Hundreds of millions of men and women have united and continue to unite around the Stockholm Declaration to ban atomic weapons, uniting all people of goodwill, regardless of their political and religious beliefs, ethnicity, or party affiliation. The demand to ban atomic weapons and declare the first government to use them a war criminal has become the demand of people all over the world.
    The unremitting struggle of peace-loving people in various countries against the warmongers demonstrates that the forces of peace and democracy are constantly strengthening and proves that the imperialists who undermine the cause of peace are increasingly isolated.
    The imperialist bloc, on the road to new military adventures and fascism, is attempting to find a way out of the increasingly acute contradictions of capitalism. Attacks on the living standards and civil rights of people in various countries, tolerant indulgence of militarization, intensified suppression of democratic forces, racist and misanthropic propaganda, and shameless calls for the slaughter of millions – this is the daily routine of the modern capitalist world.
    Opposed to the world of oppression, aggression, and bloody wars of aggression is a new world – the growing socialist and democratic world.
    The great achievements of peaceful and creative labor in the Soviet Union and the people's democracies inspire people in various countries to engage in a more organized and self-sacrificing struggle for peace and democracy.
    The Soviet government's historic resolution on the construction of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River, which will be the largest hydroelectric power stations in the world, resounded throughout the world. These two resolutions clearly demonstrate the unwavering determination of the Soviet people to consolidate the cause of peace through their creative labor and to continuously advance along the road to communism.
    The Soviet people enthusiastically endorse Stalin's great program for engineering projects with a feeling of well-deserved pride.
    Comrade Kolbasov, a technician at the "Hammer and Sickle" factory in Saratov, said: "Our group of workers signed the Stockholm Declaration, demonstrating their unwavering will to defend peace and strengthen the power of our motherland. Following the resolution of the Soviet State Council to build a powerful hydroelectric power station near Kuibyshev, the resolution to build the Stalingrad hydroelectric power station is a new demonstration of our country's peaceful policy and a new demonstration of the Party and government's extreme concern for the well-being of the people. The Kuibyshev hydroelectric power station and the Stalingrad hydroelectric power station – these are communist constructions. We will repay the government's concern for the people with self-sacrificing labor for the well-being of the motherland and for world peace."
    Millions of workers and peasants in the people's democracies are engaged in inspiring labor in a peaceful environment. The Chinese people, liberated from the shackles of oppression and enslavement, are confidently implementing democratic reforms in their own country.
    Millions of people in various countries are defending peace. Regardless of the repression by the imperialist reactionaries, the forces of resistance of the masses in Western Europe continue to grow, and they are fighting against the American enslavers. The anti-imperialist struggle front in colonial and dependent countries is also expanding.
    The freedom-loving Korean people are engaged in a heroic struggle against American armed intervention. They are pushing the American aggressor troops step by step to the south. The frenzied bombing of peaceful Korean cities and villages, the American executioners' massacre of innocent women, children, and the elderly and weak, cannot destroy the Korean people's unwavering will to win.
    The criminal activities of the American warmongers have strengthened the threat to peace worldwide. The Chinese people and all progressive humanity condemn with unparalleled anger the new act of aggression by the American imperialists – the bombers of the rural areas of Northeast China. Peace-loving people in various countries demand an end to the aggression and the immediate withdrawal of American troops from Korea.
    The infinite strength of the peace-loving people in various countries answers the provocations of the imperialist warmongers with the further unity of their ranks and with a more determined struggle to defend peace.
    Peace advocates continue to carry out the movement to ban atomic weapons, firmly advocating the reduction of armaments, monitoring the implementation of armament reductions, and preventing any aggression that could cause war in any country.
    The First All-Poland Congress of Peace Supporters, which closed a few days ago in Warsaw, expressed the Polish people's determination to fight for the further expansion of the movement to defend peace and oppose the imperialist warmongers. The Congress demanded the banning of atomic weapons and the elimination of any weapons of mass destruction of humanity in storage. The Congress called for universal arms limitation and effective control of armaments. The Congress unanimously advocated the cessation and prevention of any aggression and armed intervention, the cessation of American aggression against Korea, and demanded the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from other countries' territories. It represented the entire Polish people in demanding an end to the insane bombing of residential areas and citizens.
    There is no doubt that these demands will be greatly welcomed by ordinary people in countries all over the world, because these demands are in line with the wishes of the majority of the world's people.
    Peace advocates resolutely condemn the criminal acts of the most heinous enemies of mankind, who unscrupulously promote new wars. Churchill, Bradley, Johnson, Beauregard, Renault, and other major warmongers are becoming increasingly brazen in calling for war and calling for the use of atomic bombs to slaughter millions of children, women, and the elderly and weak.
    To end the propaganda of new wars and to stop the propagators of mass destruction of humanity who sow the seeds of hatred among the people of various countries is the unanimous demand of all upright people in the world.
    As early as 1946, Comrade Stalin instructed: "It is necessary to organize extensive counter-propaganda among public opinion and ruling groups in various countries against the propaganda of new wars. At the same time, in order to guarantee peace, no speech by the propagandists of new wars should escape due refutation by public opinion and the press. In this way, war-mongers can be exposed in a timely manner and not be given the opportunity to abuse freedom of speech against the interests of peace."
    In the process of preparing for the Second World Peace Congress, there is no doubt that new achievements will be made in expanding the mass base of the peace movement. Peace fighters are increasingly strengthening their efforts to involve the broad strata of residents, especially women, youth, and peasants, in the active struggle against the warmongers. Hundreds of millions more people will sign the Stockholm Declaration, demanding an end to aggression and propaganda for new wars.
    The powerful movement to defend peace is constantly expanding its ranks and strengthening the struggle against the warmongers. No repression or provocation by the imperialists can destroy the unwavering determination of the people of various countries to win the battle to defend peace.
    For the sake of peace, people of goodwill in all countries must unite their ranks more closely. For the sake of peace, the workers of the people's democracies are successfully building the foundations of socialism. For the sake of peace, the Soviet people, who are victoriously building a communist society under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, are engaged in self-sacrificing labor. The sacred cause of defending world peace must triumph, because the struggle to defend peace is led by Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of all progressive humanity.

　　保卫和平
    ——苏联真理报社论
    到第二次世界保卫和平大会只有两个多月了。数万万保卫和平的人民正以加强反对帝国主义战争贩子和争取全世界和平的斗争来迎接这一次大会。
    更加扩大和平战线的群众基础，把保卫和平运动提高到新的阶段上，扩大纲领中和平斗争的要求——这就是各国千百万和平拥护者现时对自己提出来的任务。
    人民生活中最辉煌的和令人兴奋的事件之一，便是不断地加强和扩大全民保卫和平，反对帝国主义战争贩子的运动。历史上还从未有过像保卫和平运动这样人数众多的，真正全民的运动。自美英帝国主义侵略者准备的新战争危险下保卫和平的崇高思想，团结着人类一切的进步力量。
    数万万男人和妇女已团结和继续团结在斯德哥尔摩禁用原子武器宣言的周围，一切意志善良的人们，不论其政治与宗教信仰、不分其民族和党派，都团结起来了。禁用原子武器和宣布第一个使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯的要求，已成了世界各国人民的要求。
    爱好和平的各国人民反对战争贩子的坚持不懈的斗争，表明了和平与民主力量在不断地加强着，证明了破坏和平事业的帝国主义者日益孤立。
    帝国主义集团在新的军事冒险与法西斯主义化的道路上，试图寻找摆脱资本主义日益尖锐矛盾的出路。对各国人民的生活水平与公民权利的进攻，对军国主义化的宽容放纵，对民主力量镇压的加强，人种论和仇恨人的宣传，屠杀千百万人的无耻号召——这就是现代资本主义世界的家常便饭。
    与压迫、侵略和血腥侵略战争的世界对立的是新的世界——日益成长壮大的社会主义与民主的世界。
    苏联和各人民民主国家的和平创造劳动的伟大成就，激励着各国人民去为和平与民主而作更加有组织的和自我献身的斗争。
    苏联政府关于在伏尔加河畔建筑库依贝舍夫和斯大林格勒水电站历史性的决议响彻了全世界，这两个水电站将是世界上规模最宏大的水电站。在这两个决议中很清楚地显示出苏联人民以自己创造劳动来巩固和平事业并沿着走向共产主义的道路不断前进的不屈不挠的决心。
    苏联人民以理应自豪的感情，热烈地赞同斯大林的伟大工程纲领。
    萨拉托夫“镰锤”工厂技匠柯尔巴索夫同志说道：“我们这一班工人签名斯德哥尔摩宣言，表现了他们保卫和平、加强我们祖国威力的坚定不移的意志。苏联国务院继在库依贝舍夫城近郊建筑一个强大水电站的决议之后，通过了建筑斯大林格勒水电站的决议，这乃是我国奉行和平政策的新的明证，是党和政府对人民福祉极度关心的新的明证。库依贝舍夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站——这是共产主义的建筑物。我们要用为祖国福祉、为世界和平的自我献身的劳动来报答政府对人民的关心。”
    各人民民主国家千百万工人和农民在和平的环境下从事着令人鼓舞的劳动。挣脱了压迫和奴役枷锁的中国人民在自己的国家里满怀信心地实行着民主的改革。
    各国千百万人民都在保卫和平。不管帝国主义反动派的镇压，西欧人民大众的反抗力量依然是增长不已，他们为反对美国奴役者而斗争。殖民地与附属国家的反帝斗争战线也在扩大中。
    爱好自由的朝鲜人民正在进行着反对美国武装干涉的英勇斗争。他们把美国侵略者的部队向南方一步一步地压缩着。对朝鲜和平城市和乡村的疯狂轰炸，美国刽子手对无辜的妇孺、儿童和老弱的残杀，并不能摧毁朝鲜人民对胜利的坚定不移的意志。
    美国战争贩子的罪恶活动加强了对全世界和平的威胁。中国人民和全体进步人类以无比的愤怒斥责了美帝国主义者——中国东北农村的轰炸者的新的侵略行为。爱好和平的各国人民要求制止侵略，立刻将美军自朝鲜撤出去。
    爱好和平的各国人民的无穷力量以自己队伍的更加团结，以保卫和平的更加坚决的斗争来回答帝国主义战争贩子的挑拨。
    和平拥护者继续开展禁用原子武器的运动，坚决主张缩减军备，监督军备缩减的执行和制止任何足以在任何国家引起战争的侵略。
    前几天在华沙闭幕的第一次全波兰和平拥护者代表大会，代表波兰人民表示要为进一步扩大保卫和平、反对帝国主义战争贩子的运动而斗争。代表大会要求禁用原子武器，消灭贮存的任何大量屠杀人类的武器。代表大会号召普遍限制军备并对军备实行有效的管制。代表大会一致主张制止并杜绝任何侵略和武装干涉，制止美国对朝鲜的侵略，要求一切外国军队立即撤出他国领土。它代表全体波兰人民要求终止对居民地点和公民的疯狂轰炸。
    毫无疑问的，这些要求会受到各国千千万万普通的人民极大的欢迎，因为这些要求符合世界大多数人民的意愿。
    和平拥护者断然地责斥了最凶恶的人类公敌的罪恶行为，这些人类的公敌肆无忌惮地宣传着新的战争。邱吉尔、布莱德雷、詹逊、伯拉巴桑、雷诺以及其他战争贩子巨头们越发厚颜无耻地号召发动战争，号召用原子弹来屠杀千百万儿童、妇孺、老弱。
    终止新战争的宣传，制止在各国人民之间散布仇恨种子的大量屠杀人类的宣传者，这乃是世界上一切正直人士的一致要求。
    斯大林同志还在一九四六年就指示说：“必须使舆论界和各国统治集团，对于新战争的宣传者，组织广泛的反宣传，同时为了保障和平，要使新战争宣传者的任何一种发言，都不能够逃避舆论和报刊方面给予应有的驳斥，这样一来便能及时揭露战争贩子，并且不使他们有机会来滥用言论自由去反对和平的利益了。”
    在准备第二次世界保卫和平大会的进程中，毫无疑问的，将会在扩大保卫和平运动的群众基础上达到新的成就。保卫和平的战士越发加强把广大的居民阶层，特别是妇女、青年、农民吸收到反对战争贩子的积极斗争中来。又有千百万人将在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，同时要求制止侵略和新战争的宣传。
    保卫和平的强大运动不断扩大自己的队伍，加强反对战争贩子的斗争。帝国主义者任何镇压、任何挑衅行为都不能摧毁各国人民赢得保卫和平战斗的坚定不移的决心。
    为了和平，各国意志善良的人们，要把自己的队伍团结得更紧。为了和平，人民民主国家的劳动者顺利地建筑着社会主义的基础。为了和平，在布尔什维克党领导下胜利建设着共产主义社会的苏联人民从事着自我献身的劳动。保卫全世界和平的神圣事业必定胜利，因为有全体进步人类的伟大领袖和导师斯大林同志来领导保卫和平的斗争。
