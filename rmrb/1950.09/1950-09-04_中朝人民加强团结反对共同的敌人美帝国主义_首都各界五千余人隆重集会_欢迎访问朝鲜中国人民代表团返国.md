Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, emphasized in his welcoming speech on behalf of the two million citizens of Beijing: After U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea and announced its aggression against Taiwan, U.S. planes dared to intrude into Andong, Linjiang, and Ji'an in our Northeast and indiscriminately strafed, which is intolerable to the Chinese people.
