Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: The Philippine People's Liberation Army has recently continued to launch offensives against the Quirino puppet government troops. According to a United Press dispatch from Manila: The Philippine People's Liberation Army attacked Teresa City (Rizal Province), ten miles east of Manila, on the 20th. On the 25th, approximately 500 Philippine People's Liberation Army soldiers attacked Quirino puppet troops in Cavite Province (approximately twenty miles south of Manila), where the U.S. naval base is located. Philippine puppet government Defense Minister Magsaysay, in a recent speech in Iloilo (Panay Island), had to admit that the situation of the Philippine "Civil Resistance Army" was "becoming increasingly serious." According to his estimates, there are now 40,000 "rebels" in Central Luzon alone.
Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: According to a report from the Electrical Communication Agency in London: The "Times" newspaper, in an editorial on the 20th discussing the expansion of the Philippine liberation movement, acknowledged that the Philippine liberation movement is flourishing. The editorial stated: The large scale of this movement and the support it receives from all levels of the Philippine people are due to the economic and financial chaos that the Philippines has fallen into. The hunger and suffering of the people now is more widespread than during the worst times of the Japanese occupation. Prices are ridiculously high. Everyone accuses the government of corruption and incompetence. The "Times" then recounted: The United States has spent two billion dollars to aid the corrupt Quirino regime, but this money has been spent with no results, and no work has been done for the deteriorating rural areas, and the Civil Resistance Army movement gains its strength from these rural areas.

　　菲解放军攻入德列萨
    并在甲美地省攻击傀儡军
    英泰晤士报透露菲解放运动蓬勃发展
    【新华社二十七日讯】菲律宾人民解放军最近继续对季里诺傀儡政府军发动攻势。据合众社马尼拉讯：菲律宾人民解放军曾于二十日攻入马尼拉以东十英里的德列萨城（黎撤省）。二十五日，约五百名左右的菲人民解放军，在美海军基地所在的甲美地省（马尼拉以南约二十英里）攻击季里诺傀儡军。菲傀儡政府国防部长麦格赛赛于最近在怡朗（班乃省）讲演时，不得不承认：菲律宾“民抗军”的情况已“日趋严重”。据他的估计，仅在中吕宋省，现在已有四万“叛乱分子”。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据电通社伦敦报道：泰晤士报二十日在一篇论述菲律宾解放运动扩展的社论中，承认菲律宾解放运动正在蓬勃发展。该社论说：这个运动规模的庞大和菲律宾各阶层人民对它的支持，是由于菲律宾所陷入的经济和财政的混乱状况而产生的。现在人民的饥饿和痛苦比日本占领时代最坏的时候还要普遍。物价高的不像样子。大家纷纷指责政府贪污和无能。泰晤士报然后追述道：美国为援助腐败的季里诺政权已经花掉二十亿美元，不过这些钱花得一点没有收获，对情况恶劣的乡村一点工作也没有做，而民抗军运动就是从这些乡村获得其实力的。
