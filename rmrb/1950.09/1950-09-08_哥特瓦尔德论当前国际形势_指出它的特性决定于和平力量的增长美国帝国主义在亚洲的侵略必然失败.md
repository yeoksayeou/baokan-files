Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 7th: Czechoslovak President Gottwald delivered a speech in the Lisen Valley near Brno on the 4th. This day marked the renaming of the picturesque Lisen Valley to "Gottwald Valley."

President Gottwald discussed the current international situation, pointing out that the United States provoked the war in Korea in order to dominate the entire Korean peninsula and make it a starting point for further aggression. The issue is clear: the aggressor in Korea is American imperialism, and no matter what excuses it fabricates in the Security Council, the facts cannot be washed away. The internationally recognized definition of aggression, also endorsed by the US government in 1933 (referring to the Declaration on the Definition of Aggression adopted by the Committee on Security Issues of the League of Nations in May 1933), clearly states that no civil war can be used as a pretext for military intervention by another country.

Gottwald continued: After provoking the Korean War, American imperialism immediately occupied Taiwan, an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China. American imperialism is also supplying weapons to British and French imperialism to suppress the liberation struggles of the Vietnamese and Malayan peoples. The war instigators' plans are not limited to Asia; they are constantly trying to build a West German army to implement their war plans. These facts all demonstrate that international imperialists are intensifying preparations for launching a new world war.

Gottwald emphasized that it would be wrong to think that the characteristics of the current international situation are determined by these facts alone. The characteristics of the current international situation are mainly determined by the growth of peace forces, with the great Soviet Union as its standard-bearer. In this regard, Korea is the best example. The heroic Korean people are not only driving out and destroying the Seungman Rhee bandit army, but also defeating the American aggressor forces. This shows that although American monopoly capitalists have great greed and hope to swallow the entire world, courage is another matter. They themselves do not go to war, and the American people are unwilling to fight for their dirty interests. The Korean people do not retreat even in the face of that savage aerial warfare, which is in no way inferior to the Hitlerite bandits. Just as American imperialism has met with heroic resistance in Korea, they will not succeed anywhere else in Asia, nor will they succeed anywhere else in the world, not even in the capitals of capitalism.

In conclusion, Gottwald pointed out the significance and success of signing the Stockholm Peace Appeal and emphasized: We are convinced that, judging from the current balance of power, it is not the brutal imperialism that will win, but the peoples of all nations who yearn for peace. We can fully and accurately explain it in the words of our poet Pizluchi: We have seen the throne of the oppressors collapsing, and we will see even their last bastion, Wall Street, fall.

　　哥特瓦尔德论当前国际形势
    指出它的特性决定于和平力量的增长美国帝国主义在亚洲的侵略必然失败
    【新华社布拉格七日电】捷克斯洛伐克总统哥特瓦尔德于四日在布尔诺附近的利森河谷发表演说。这一天是风景幽美的利森河谷更名为“哥特瓦尔德河谷”的一天。
    哥特瓦尔德总统论述了当前的国际形势。指出美国在朝鲜挑起战争，是为了统治整个朝鲜，使它成为进一步侵略的起点。问题很明白：在朝鲜的侵犯者就是美帝国主义，不论它在安理会中制造任何借口与事实都无法洗刷。国际公认的、亦为美国政府在一九三三年所赞同的侵略定义（按指一九三三年五月国际联盟安全问题委员会所通过的侵略定义宣言），很明白地说：任何内战都不能作为另一国家的军事干涉的借口。
    哥特瓦尔德继称：美帝国主义在挑起了朝鲜战争之后，立即又占领了为中华人民共和国的不可分的部分的台湾。美帝国主义又供给英、法帝国主义以武器，来反对越南、马来亚各民族的解放斗争。战争挑拨者的计划还不仅限于亚洲，他们一直要建立一支西德军队，以便实施其战争计划。这些事实都说明国际帝国主义者们正在加紧准备发动新的世界大战。
    哥特瓦尔德强调指出：假若认为目前国际形势的特性是决定于这些事实，那就错了。目前国际形势的特性主要地决定于以伟大苏联为旗手的和平力量的增长。在这一方面朝鲜又是最好的例子。英勇的朝鲜人民不仅在驱逐和摧毁李承晚的匪军，而且正在击败美国侵略者的军队。这说明了美国垄断资本家有很大的贪欲，希望吞没全世界，可是谈到勇敢的话，却是另外一回事了。他们自己不去打仗，并且美国人民也不愿为他们的肮脏利益打仗。而朝鲜人民甚至在那种比起希特勒匪徒毫无逊色的野蛮的空中战争的面前也不后退。正像美帝国主义在朝鲜遇到了英勇的抵抗一样，他们在亚洲其他各地也不会成功，他们在世界上其他任何地方，甚至在资本主义的都城里也都不会得到成功的。
    哥特瓦尔德在结语中指出在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名的意义和成功，并强调宣称：我们确信从现在的力量对比看来，将要赢得胜利的不是残暴的帝国主义，而是渴望和平的各族人民。我们可以完全准确地用我国诗人皮兹鲁奇的话来说明：我们看到了压迫者的宝座已在崩毁，我们并将看到甚至他们的最后堡垒华尔街也要陷落。
