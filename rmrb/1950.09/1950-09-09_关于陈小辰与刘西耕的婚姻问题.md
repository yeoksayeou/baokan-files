　　On the Marriage of Chen Xiaochen and Liu Xigeng
    On May 15th of this year, the Tianjin Daily's Social Service section published a letter signed "Chen Shaoyun," reflecting that cadres in Ba County, Hebei Province, were illegally interfering with her freedom of marriage. The Tianjin Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court and the Ba County People's Court believed that the situation reflected in this letter did not match the facts and requested a correction. The Tianjin Daily sent a letter to this newspaper, requesting that this newspaper express its opinion on this matter to clarify the truth. After receiving these letters, this newspaper, in addition to its own research, also requested the Supreme People's Court to send personnel to investigate and handle the matter. On the 6th of this month, the Supreme People's Court sent this newspaper Comrade Yang Xianzhi's investigation report and the Supreme People's Court's instructions to the Hebei Provincial Court as the final handling opinion for this case. Now, the several documents related to this case and this newspaper's opinion on this case are published together below.

    Chen Xiaochen's Letter to the Tianjin Daily
    Editor:
    I am a weak woman of twenty-seven years old, originally from Gedan Village, Ba County. My husband passed away three years ago, leaving behind three boys and fifteen mu of land, making it impossible to maintain a living. Therefore, I entrusted the two older children to their uncle and, with the younger child, remarried to a certain youth. Two days after the marriage, my older brother came to me asking for fifteen shi of corn, saying it was because he had not been consulted about the marriage. But I had no money in hand (the previous family property had been given to the children's uncle for the children's use), so I didn't give him anything. He went back and sued me in the district, and the district chief said he had no right to interfere with my freedom; he went to the county to sue me, and the county magistrate sentenced me to one month of imprisonment. When I was released, the county magistrate said to me: "Whom you wish to marry must be discussed with the village cadres of your natal family." After returning home, the village cadres said: "I'll find someone for you to marry." I didn't agree. They sent me to Yangliuqing Special District and locked me up. Now I have been detained for more than two months, and I have no way out. Please comrades, point me to a clear path!
    Chen Shaoyun (i.e., Chen Xiaochen)
    Letter from Zhang Zishan, Commissioner of Tianjin Special District, to the Tianjin Daily
    Comrades in charge of the Social Service Department of the Tianjin Daily:
    Regarding the article published by your agency on the Ba County government interfering with freedom of marriage, after questioning the Ba County government and Chen Xiaochen (i.e., Chen Shaoyun mentioned in the report), it does not conform to the facts. Yesterday, Comrade Che Kefu from our office discussed this situation with your agency, and according to your agency: "In order to implement the Marriage Law, it is necessary to publish this article, correct it if there is anything wrong, and encourage it if there is nothing wrong." We believe that if this absurd and untrue report, even malicious attacks on the government's credibility by certain bad elements, is used as material for educating the masses, it does not conform to the authenticity and the spirit of seeking truth from facts of the people's newspapers, and it is feared that it will encourage bad elements to further spread rumors and sabotage. Our opinion is that the true facts of the case, Chen's correction letter, and the Ba County government's judgment should be disclosed together in the newspaper to distinguish the truth and correct the public's understanding. This is our sincere hope.
    Whether the above opinions are correct, we hope you will correct them and maintain frequent contact to improve our work.

    Tianjin Daily's Letter to This Newspaper
    Comrades in charge of the People's Garden:
    The Social Service section of this newspaper published a reader's letter on May 15th (the original letter and clipping attached). After publication, we received three letters from the Ba County People's Court, the Tianjin Special District Commissioner, and the Tianjin District Court, and attached two "Criminal Judgments of the Ba County People's Court" and Chen Xiaochen's correction letter, stating that the reader's letter published on May 15th was inconsistent with the facts and requesting this newspaper to correct it. According to a letter from the Tianjin Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court: "According to Chen Xiaochen, Liu Xigeng may have intentionally slandered the government by reporting the situation to the newspaper, and the original county has been notified to summon Liu and handle him according to the law." Now Liu Xigeng (working in a small weaving factory in this city) has been summoned and has not yet returned to Tianjin. The above is the process of this issue. We have the following opinions on this issue, and we don't know if they are correct? Please give instructions.
    1.  If the letter of Chen Shaoyun (i.e., Chen Xiaochen) published in this newspaper was indeed written by Liu Xigeng, does the local People's Court have the right to summon the letter writer? If there is a discrepancy with the facts, a correction can be declared, but is it legally justified to summon the letter writer (according to the understanding on the 27th, Liu has not returned)? Does it infringe on Liu Xigeng's personal freedom and hinder the contact between the people and the newspapers?
    2.  If Chen Xiaochen was convicted of infanticide, why was she not convicted when she committed infanticide in August of last year? Why was she arrested and convicted in January of this year when Chen and Liu eloped?
    3.  The Ba County People's Court believes that Chen and Liu are "adulterous and eloping"—should this issue be viewed this way? Can the legitimate emotional relationship between Chen and Liu be considered adulterous and eloping? Is it because the male she loves is the son brought by her brother-in-law's wife, so the village-level cadres do not allow her (them) to marry?
    4.  What is the basic nature of this case, the issue of interfering with freedom of marriage, or the focus on the issue of infanticide? From another perspective, under what circumstances did Chen Xiaochen strangle the child? Was it strangled under the pressure of the feudal family and the village cadres because the marriage issue was not legally resolved? Or did she really voluntarily strangle her child?
    5.  We believe that the judgment of the Ba County People's Court handles practical problems from a purely legal point of view, which not only fails to protect the marriage interests of the working people, but in fact becomes a supporter of unreasonable interference in the marriage of the working people.
    The above are our opinions. Please analyze this issue and give us instructions as soon as possible so that we can publish it publicly. If we have made a mistake in publishing the reader's letter, we can also review and correct it.

    Comrade Yang Xianzhi's Investigation Report on the Chen and Liu Marriage Case
    Chen Xiaochen (female), 27 years old, from Gedan Village, Sixth District, Ba County, Hebei Province. Her original husband's family was in Xiaowan. When Xiaochen was 14 years old, her sister arranged for her to be engaged to Yan Zengyu of Xiaowan Village as a child bride. After marriage, she gave birth to three children. Yan Zengyu, due to having an affair with Zhang Hede's wife in the same village, was killed by Chen Xiaosen in the village three years ago.
    Liu Xigeng (male), 27 years old, from Ronghua Town, Jing County, Hebei. He became an apprentice in Tianjin at the age of twelve; now he works at Rongji Factory in Zhen De Li, Erwei Road, Tianjin. His father died early, and his mother remarried to Yan Zengqi (i.e., Yan Zengyu's brother) in Xiaowan Village ten years ago. Liu Xigeng's elder brother, sister-in-law, and sister all live in Guochang, Anci County. During his days off, Liu Xigeng would go to his mother's house in Xiaowan and his sister's house in Guochang to stay. Because Chen Xiaochen had no labor force at home after her husband's death, Xigeng kept helping Xiaochen with chores. As a result, they gradually developed feelings for each other, and in the first month of the year before last (lunar calendar), they had sexual relations. On August 4th of last year (lunar calendar), Xiaochen gave birth to a girl, who was immediately strangled to death by Xiaochen.
    After having sexual relations, Chen Xiaochen said to Liu Xigeng: "You work hard for me, and I will marry you later." Two or three months after becoming pregnant, Liu Xigeng went to Xiaowan. Xiaochen said to Liu Xigeng: "What should we do if we have a child?" and suggested "abortion" and "marrying Liu Xigeng." But no mature opinion was formed in the end. Regarding the strangling of the child, according to Xiaochen: "After the child was born, Xiaochen said to her brother Chen Ketang: 'Brother, I have embarrassed you—I have given birth to a child.' Chen Ketang said: 'Strangle the child.' Xiaochen said: 'If I don't strangle the child, the child is Liu Xigeng's, and I want to look for him (meaning to marry him).' Chen Ketang said: 'Take care of Yan Zengyu's (referring to Chen's former husband) children and live a good life!'" In this way, Xiaochen strangled the baby, and it was given to Chen Ketang to bury.
    After Xiaochen gave birth to the child, some people in the village said: "The relationship between Xiaochen and Liu Xigeng is unclear, and the child may be his." At this time, Liu's mother scolded Liu Xigeng for making such a mess and said that he should not come to Xiaowan again. Since then, Liu Xigeng did not dare to go to Xiaowan again. Later, because Xiaochen was in difficult circumstances and had feelings for Liu Xigeng and had a child with him, she took the initiative to find Liu's sister and asked to marry Liu Xigeng. After being conveyed by her sister, Liu Xigeng agreed to marry, so on the fourth day of the first lunar month last year, Xiaochen, under the pretext of going to her cousin's house, took her youngest child to Guochang and worshiped heaven and earth with Liu Xigeng.
    Two days after the marriage, Xiaochen's brother Chen Ketang, her cousin, and Chen Xiaochen's elder brother-in-law Yan Zengqi went to Guochang to find Xiaochen together. When Chen Ketang saw Xiaochen, he immediately asked: "Why didn't you discuss with me when you got married?" He then proposed to take fifteen shi of corn. The village cadres mediated, and Xiaochen also persuaded her brother, saying: "I don't have any food now. We are siblings. If you have no way to make a living in the future, you can go to Tianjin to live, and I will support you." Only then did Chen Ketang change his attitude. Finally, Liu Xigeng took out one shi of corn and one dou of wheat. Chen Ketang also met Liu Xigeng's sister and recognized her as a relative. Chen Ketang stayed in Guochang for five or six days before returning to Xiaowan.
    After Chen Ketang returned to Xiaowan, he reported to the district again. On the eleventh or twelfth day of the first lunar month, Chen Ketang, along with Chen Jiansan, the militia captain of Gedan Village, and Chen Ronghua, the village deputy, took guns to Guochang and arrested Liu and Chen and detained them. That night, the village cadres of Gedan Village and some militiamen and people from the Chen family talked to Liu Xigeng and Chen Xiaochen separately and threatened and forced them to "break up." Militia captain Chen Jiansan said to Liu Xigeng: "Will you break up or not? If you don't break up, we'll send you to the district? You outsider still wants to find cheap here? Do you still want to mess with the Chen family?" But Liu Xigeng's reply was: "This is not me forcing her. We are both willing." The village cadres of Gedan Village used soft methods to persuade Chen Xiaochen, but Chen Xiaochen firmly said: "I have already married him, and I will not look for anyone else." The next day, they were escorted to the district by the militiamen.
    After the district chief found out the facts of the case, he announced the handling method: (1) Since they are already married, their marriage can be recognized; (2) It is wrong to have committed adultery before marriage; (3) Infanticide is illegal; (4) He instructed the village cadres to return to the village and hold a mass meeting, asking them to confess their mistakes at the meeting and telling the masses not to learn from such people; (5) Chen Ketang cannot ask for food. Later, Chen Ketang also raised the issue that Xiaochen had debts, and the district chief allowed Liu to take some food to repay the debts. Liu Xigeng also agreed.
    However, the village cadres did not agree with the district chief's handling, so they wrote a letter and gave it to village deputy Chen Jinzeng to send to the county in person. Han, the presiding judge of the Ba County People's Court (now renamed the Ba County People's Court), believed that the masses did not understand this marriage ideologically and that it was necessary to summon them for questioning, so he decided to summon them to the county for interrogation. After the village deputy returned to the village, he sent two militiamen to Guochang to escort Chen Xiaochen and Liu Xigeng to the county. After a simple inquiry by the county people's court, it was believed that their marriage was acceptable, but Chen Xiaochen should be punished for infanticide. Xigeng was released, and Xiaochen was detained, and later sentenced to six months in prison and sent to Yangliuqing Tianjin Special District Branch for centralized execution.
    After Xigeng was released and returned to Tianjin, he discussed with his fellow workers and said that he should ask the newspaper, so he asked his teacher to write a letter and send it to the Tianjin Daily.
    After the Tianjin Daily published this letter in the Social Service section on May 15, it immediately aroused dissatisfaction from the Ba County People's Court and the Tianjin Special District Branch of Hebei Province, and they wrote letters to the Tianjin Daily, stating that the letter was inconsistent with the facts and requesting correction. Later, Chen Xiaochen, who was in prison, was ordered to submit a statement correcting the inconsistencies with the facts, and it was believed that Liu Xigeng had intentionally fabricated facts to damage the government's credibility. Xigeng was summoned and detained for two days, and then transferred to the Ba County People's Court for handling (he was detained for another month and five days in Ba County). During this period, the Ba County People's Court wrote a correction letter on behalf of Liu and asked him to put his fingerprint on it and send it to the Tianjin Daily, and then released Liu.
    The Tianjin Daily believes that regardless of whether the letters it published were consistent with the facts, Liu Xigeng, the person who submitted the letter, should not be summoned and detained, because this would hinder the contact between the newspaper and the people.
    Based on the above situation, we believe that:
    (1) Regarding the matter of Chen Xiaochen strangling the child, according to Xiaochen, it was instructed by her brother Chen Ketang. After Chen Xiaochen and Liu Xigeng got married, Chen Ketang went to question Xiaochen again: "Why didn't you discuss with me when you got married?" He took the opportunity to ask Chen and Liu for fifteen shi of corn (later changed to one shi of corn and one dou of wheat), and then took the village cadres and militiamen to detain Chen and Liu illegally. This not only shows that he illegally interfered with Chen and Liu's marriage, but also plagiarized the bad habits of extortion under the pretext of "widow remarriage" in the old society.
    (2) The village cadres and militiamen of Gedan Village, together with Chen Ketang, reported to the district and illegally detained Chen and Liu, and repeatedly threatened Chen and Liu to "break up." This violates the Marriage Law and the decree guaranteeing human rights.
    (3) Although the district chief recognized Chen and Liu's marriage, his views were not clear enough. He did not criticize and educate Chen Ketang and the village cadres for their feudal and backward thinking and behavior that hinders freedom of marriage, but instead told Chen and Liu to return to the village and confess to the masses. This actually played a suppressive role in Chen and Liu's marriage.
    (4) The handling of Chen and Liu's marriage case by the Ba County People's Court also showed feudal and backward thinking and adopted a disapproving attitude. In actual handling, it failed to correctly publicize the people's government's marriage policy and educate cadres and the masses; it only sentenced Xiaochen to six months in prison for infanticide based on the one-sided requirements of the village cadres, objectively catering to the backward thinking of the village cadres; not only did it fail to question Chen Ketang and the village cadres' behavior of obstructing marriage and illegal arrests and detentions, but in the judgment of Xiaochen's infanticide, it began by saying: "The defendant's style is not correct... less than a year after her husband died, she committed adultery with the son brought by her brother-in-law's wife. The perpetrator's husband has died, so she should marry openly..." The same is said in their correction letter to the Tianjin Daily. This is not only unrelated to the crime of infanticide, but on the contrary, it is a kind of disapproval of Chen and Liu's marriage.
    The Opinion of the Supreme People's Court
    Dean Du of the Hebei Provincial People's Court:
    Regarding the marriage case of Chen Xiaochen and Liu Xigeng, the leader of the Criminal Trial Tribunal of our court, Yang Xianzhi, together with Comrade Liu Guokun of your court, went to the Tianjin Special District Branch and then to Ba County to conduct an investigation. After reviewing the report, our court puts forward the following points:
    (1) The village cadres of Gedan Village in Ba County took a disapproving and even interfering attitude towards the marriage of Chen Xiaochen and Liu Xigeng due to feudal and backward thinking. This is reflected in treating the independent and voluntary combination of Chen and Liu, both of whom had no spouses, as adultery and elopement, arresting and detaining them, and exerting pressure to make them "break up." Although the chief of the Sixth District admitted their marriage on the one hand, he ordered Chen and Liu to return to the village to confess their mistakes to the masses on the other hand. This way of handling the problem is obviously still a conciliatory attitude that accommodates the feudal and backward thinking of the village cadres of Gedan Village, and in essence, it is a disapproving disposal of Chen and Liu's independent and voluntary marriage. The People's Court should firmly stand on the anti-feudal position and handle the people's marriage relations to protect the people's legitimate rights and interests; however, the Ba County People's Court is still tainted with feudal ideas about Chen and Liu's marriage and used feudal-minded pronouncements such as "her husband died less than a year ago" and "she should marry openly" (which is to blame Xiaochen for not observing widowhood or observing widowhood for a few more years after her husband's death, and that she cannot remarry without a "go-between"). This was attached to the irrelevant case of Chen Xiaochen's infanticide. After comprehensive research on the entire case of Chen and Liu's marriage, we believe that the handling of Chen Xiaochen's infanticide is a pretext to express dissatisfaction with Chen and Liu's marriage. Of course, infanticide is a criminal act, and legal sanctions should be given to infanticide. However, Chen's infanticide should be mainly the responsibility of her brother Chen Ketang. The investigation report stated: "According to Xiaochen, after the child was born, Xiaochen said to Chen Ketang: 'Brother, I have embarrassed you, I have given birth to a child.' Chen Ketang said: 'Strangle the child.' Xiaochen said: 'If I don't strangle the child, the child is Liu Xigeng's, and I want to look for him.' Chen Ketang said: 'Take care of Yan Zengyu's (referring to Chen's former husband) children and live a good life.'" Although this passage came from Xiaochen, Chen Ketang refused to admit it. According to reason and sentiment, this is completely believable. Therefore, it can be determined that Chen Xiaochen's infanticide was not Chen's voluntary act, but the instigation of her brother Chen Ketang; not only was it instigation, but there was also the threat of parental authority (Chen Xiaochen did not dare to ask her brother Chen Ketang about marriage, and Chen Ketang's behavior when he and Yan Zengqi went to Chen Xiaochen's house after Chen and Liu got married shows this). Therefore, we believe that the main responsibility for the crime of infanticide should be borne by Chen Ketang, and the Ba County People's Court did not conduct an investigation and study, but only blamed Chen Xiaochen and sentenced her to six months in prison for the crime of infanticide, while leaving Chen Ketang unasked. This is a very unfair judgment. This unfair judgment is based on feudal and backward thinking and expresses a pretext for dissatisfaction with Chen and Liu's marriage. Moreover, Chen's sentence was not at the time of infanticide, but just when Chen and Liu had a marriage relationship five months after Chen's infanticide. This can also prove the above argument. This shows that the County People's Court not only did not stand on the position of anti-feudal thinking to correctly handle Chen and Liu's marriage problem, but instead took infanticide as the subject and sentenced Chen to imprisonment, which actually hindered their independent and voluntary marriage. This deserves attention.
    (2) The Tianjin Special District Branch and the Ba County People's Court also showed bureaucratism and acts of infringing on human rights in handling the marriage of Chen and Liu. For example, after the Tianjin Daily published a letter signed by Chen Shaoyun, the Tianjin Branch actually did not conduct an investigation and hastily recognized that Liu was maliciously attacking the government, took Liu away without authorization, and detained him for two days, and then transferred him to Ba County for illegal detention for up to one month and five days. During Chen and Liu's detention, they instructed Chen to write a correction letter and wrote it on their behalf, and also wrote a correction letter for Liu and ordered him to put his fingerprint on it before releasing him. These are all serious bureaucratic and commanding styles, and they are all acts of infringing on human rights.
    (3) After the Tianjin Special District Branch and the Ba County People's Court handled the publication of Chen Xiaochen's letter in the Tianjin Daily, they did not consider the issue from the correct relationship between the People's Government and the People's Newspaper and the people, and did not seriously check the shortcomings and errors in their work in the spirit of "correcting if there are any mistakes, and encouraging if there are none." Instead, they only asked the newspaper to correct it and abused their power to give detention after summoning the person who submitted the letter. This behavior seriously hindered the connection between the people and the newspaper and damaged the prestige of the People's Government.
    Based on the above understanding, in addition to publishing the results of this investigation in the newspaper, our court also hopes that your court will study it in detail and consult with the provincial government so that the cadres involved in this case who are related to the infringement of human rights will be held accountable and receive due punishment. We will also combine rectification and study to instruct relevant cadres to conduct in-depth self-criticism and educate all staff to establish a serious concept of the rule of law, improve cadres' policy thinking and the style of seeking truth from facts, and hope to report the handling results in detail.
    President  Shen Junru
    September 5th
    Editor's Note
    The whole process of Chen Xiaochen and Liu Xigeng's marriage case shows that the implementation of the new Marriage Law still requires a lot of struggle. Many district and village cadres, and even cadres at the county level and above, as well as court cadres, often fail to correctly implement the Marriage Law when handling marriage cases due to the feudal consciousness left over from the old society, and even intentionally use various methods to obstruct freedom of marriage, infringe on human rights, and seriously undermine the Marriage Law. We fully agree with the Supreme People's Court's analysis and handling opinions on this case. The five questions raised by the Tianjin Daily to this newspaper can also be answered by this. This case is a good practical teaching material for cadres and the masses in various places, and administrative and judicial cadres who have wrongly handled this case should learn from this lesson and conduct in-depth self-criticism to avoid making mistakes again and ensure the implementation of the Marriage Law.

　　关于陈小辰与刘西耕的婚姻问题
    今年五月十五日，天津日报社会服务版发表了署名陈少云的来信，反映河北省霸县干部非法干涉她的婚姻自由。河北省人民法院天津区分院与霸县人民法院认为此信所反映的情况与事实不符，要求更正。天津日报曾致函本报，要求本报对此发表意见，以明是非。本报接到这些函件后，除自己研究外，并请最高人民法院派员调查处理。本月六号最高人民法院已将该院杨显之同志的调查报告、最高人民法院给河北省法院的指示寄给本报，作为对该案的最后处理意见。现将与该案有关的几个文件及本报对该案的意见一并发表于后。
    ——编者
    陈小辰给天津日报的信编者同志：
    我是一个二十七岁的弱女，原籍霸县疙疸村。我的丈夫已去世三年，留下三个男孩和十五亩地，生活无法维持。于是我把两个大孩子交给了他们的伯父，带着小孩子，改嫁于某青年。婚后两天，我娘家哥哥来向我要十五石棒子，他说因为结婚时未和他商议。但我手中无钱（以前的家产都交给孩子的伯父，留给孩子用），因此就没给他什么。他回去到区里告我，区长说他没有权利干涉我的自由；他又到县里去告我，县长判了我一个月的徒刑。刑满出来时，县长对我说：“你愿与谁结婚必须和你娘家村干商议。”回到家后，村干说：“我给你找一个别人结婚罢。”我不同意。他们就把我送到杨柳青专署押起来了。现在押了两个多月了，我也没有什么办法，请同志们指给我一条明路吧！
    陈少云（即陈小辰）
    天津专署张子善专员致天津日报的信天津日报社会服务处负责同志：
    关于贵社刊登的霸县县府干涉婚姻自由一文，经追问霸县县府与陈小辰（即报载之陈少云）报告，与事实不符。昨日敝署车可夫同志到贵社面谈此情况，据贵社称：“为贯彻婚姻法，有必要发表该文，有则改之，无则加勉。”我们认为如将此荒唐不真实的、甚至某些坏分子恶意攻击政府信誉的报道，作为教育群众的资料，这与人民报纸的真实性与实事求是的精神不相吻合，且恐助长坏分子进一步造谣破坏。我们的意见，应将该案事实真像和陈之更正书以及霸县县府判决书一并在报端公开披露，而辨真伪，以正视听，是为至盼。
    以上意见是否正确，尚希斧正，并希经常联系，以便改进我们的工作。

    五月十八日
    天津日报给本报的来信人民园地负责同志：
    本报社会服务版在五月十五日发表了一封读者来信（原信及剪报附上），发表后，先后接到霸县人民法庭、天津专署专员、天津区法院来信三封，并附来“霸县人民法庭刑事判决书”及陈小辰更正书两件，声明五月十五日所载读者信件和事实不符，请本报更正。据河北省人民法院天津区分院来信中称：“据陈小辰谈，向报社反映情况可能系刘西耕对政府有意诬蔑，已告原县将刘传讯，依法处理”。现在刘西耕（在本市一小织布工厂做工）已被传去，尚未回津。以上是这一问题的经过，对于这一问题，我们有以下意见，不知是否正确？请予以指示。
    一、如果本报发表之陈少云（即陈小辰）的来信，确为刘西耕所写，当地人民法庭是否有权传讯来信人？如果和事实有出入，可以声明更正，对来信人加以传讯（据二十七日了解，刘尚未回来），是否有法律上的根据？是否侵犯了刘西耕的人身自由，妨碍人民和报纸的联系？
    二、陈小辰如果是因溺婴而治罪，为何去年八月溺婴时不予治罪？而偏在今年正月陈与刘出走时予以拘捕治罪？
    三、霸县人民法庭认为陈刘是“通奸私逃”——这个问题是否应该这样看法？陈刘之间的正当的感情关系，能算是通奸私逃吗？是否村级干部因为他爱的那个男子是婆家嫂嫂带来的儿子而不允许她（他）们结婚？
    四、这个案件的基本性质，是干涉婚姻自由的问题呢，还是重点在溺婴的问题呢？从另一方面看，陈小辰是在怎样一种情况下把小孩掐死的？是否因婚姻问题未得合法解决，在封建家庭和村中干部的压力下面掐死的？还是她真的自愿掐死她的小孩呢？
    五、我们认为霸县人民法院的判决，是从单纯的法律的观点上处理实际问题，不但不能保障劳动人民的婚姻利益，并且事实上成为不合理的干涉劳动人民婚姻的支持者。
    以上是我们的意见，请对此问题予以分析，及早赐示！以便公开发表。如果我们发表读者来信有错误，也好检讨更正。

    一九五○年五月二十九日
    杨显之同志关于陈刘婚姻案件的调查报告
    陈小辰（女），二十七岁，河北省霸县六区疙疸村人，原夫家系在小湾。小辰十四岁时由姐作主与小湾村阎增玉订婚，做童养媳。结婚后，生小孩三个。阎增玉因与本村张和德之妻通奸，于三年前被本村陈小森杀死。
    刘西耕（男），二十七岁，河北景县荣华镇人，十二岁上即在天津当学徒；现在天津二纬路振德里荣记工厂作工。其父早死，母于十年前改嫁于小湾村阎增起（即阎增玉之兄）。刘西耕的哥、嫂、姐都住在安次县郭场。刘西耕在休工时，就到他母家小湾及姐家郭场去住。因陈小辰在夫死后家中无劳动力，西耕就不断给小辰作活。因此他俩就逐渐有了感情，并在前年正月（旧历），发生了性的关系。至去年八月初四日（旧历），小辰生下了一个女孩。当下被小辰掐死了。
    在发生性的关系后，陈小辰曾对刘西耕说：“你好好给我作活，我以后嫁你。”在怀孕两三个月后，刘西耕曾到小湾去。小辰曾对刘西耕说：“生了小孩怎么办？”并提出：“打胎”及“嫁给刘西耕”。但终未形成成熟意见。关于掐死小孩一事，据小辰说：“当时小孩生下后，小辰曾对其兄陈克堂说：“哥哥，我给你丢了人——生下孩子了。”陈克堂说：“把孩子掐死。”小辰说：“不掐死，孩子是刘西耕的，我要寻他（结婚的意思）。”陈克堂说：“你领着阎增玉的孩子好好过日子吧！”这样，小辰就把婴儿掐死了，而且是交给陈克堂去埋掉的。
    在小辰生小孩后，本村有的人说：“小辰和刘西耕关系不清，孩子可能是他的。”这时刘的母亲曾责骂刘西耕不该这样胡闹，并说以后不要到小湾来。从此刘西耕就没敢再到小湾去。后来小辰因生活困难，且与刘西耕有了感情，生过孩子，就主动去找刘的姐姐，要求与刘西耕结婚。经其姐传达后，刘西耕同意结婚，就在去年旧历正月初四日，小辰以到她表弟家去为名，带上她最小的那个孩子到郭场与刘西耕拜了天地。
    结婚两天后，小辰的哥哥陈克堂和他表弟及小辰的大伯哥阎增起一同到郭场去找小辰。陈克堂见了小辰，开口便问：“你结婚为什么不和我商量？”便提出要十五石棒子。村干进行调解，小辰也劝他哥说：“我现在没有粮食，咱是亲兄妹，以后你生活没办法时，可到天津去住，我养活你。”陈克堂这才改变了态度。最后由刘西耕拿出棒子一石、麦子一斗。陈克堂又与刘西耕的姐见了面，认了亲戚。陈克堂在郭场住了五六天后才回到小湾去。
    陈克堂回到小湾后，又向区里告发了。正月十一、二日的时候，陈克堂同疙疸村民兵队长陈简三，村副陈荣华带枪到郭场把刘陈二人抓去禁闭起来。当夜，疙疸村村干及某些民兵及陈家的人，曾分别多次向刘西耕及陈小辰进行谈话，并威胁、强迫他们“散伙”。民兵队长陈简三曾对刘西耕说：“你们散不散，不散就送区？你这个外乡人还在这里找便宜？还想和陈家大户干干么？量你好狗打不出村去。”但刘西耕的答复是：“这不是我强迫她，我们是两愿的。”疙疸村的村干便用软办法来诱劝陈小辰，但陈小辰非常坚决地说：“已经和他结婚了，不再找别人了。”第二天他们二人就被民兵押解送区了。
    区长问明案情后，宣布处理办法：（一）既已结婚可承认其婚姻；（二）先通奸而后结婚是不对的；（三）溺婴是违法行为；（四）指示村干回村召开群众大会，叫他们在会上坦白认错，叫群众不要跟这样人学；（五）陈克堂不能要粮食。后陈克堂又提出小辰有欠账，区长才允许刘拿一部分粮食还账。刘西耕也同意了。
    可是，村干不同意区长这样处理，就写了信交村副陈近增亲自送县。霸县人民法庭（现改为霸县人民法院）韩庭长认为群众对这件婚事思想上搞不通，有传讯的必要，就决定把他们传县讯问。村副回村后，即派民兵二人，再到郭场将陈小辰、刘西耕押解送县。经县人民法庭简单询问后，认为他们婚姻还可以，但陈小辰溺婴则应治罪。当将西耕开释，将小辰收押，后被判处徒刑半年，并送杨柳青天津专署分院集中执行。
    西耕被释回天津后，和工友们一商量，说问问报社吧，就找他的先生写了一个信送到天津日报去。
    五月十五日，天津日报在社会服务版内登出这一信件后，立刻引起霸县人民法庭及河北省天津专区分院不满，并写信到天津日报社，声明该信与事实不符，要求更正。后又令在监的陈小辰提出声明与事实不符的更正书一件，并认为刘西耕有意捏造事实，破坏政府信誉。当将西耕传去押了两天，移送霸县人民法庭处理（在霸县又被押了一月零五天）。其间，霸县人民法庭曾给刘代写一更正书，令按指印后寄交天津日报社，同时将刘开释。
    天津日报社认为所登信件不管与事实有无出入，不应将登报人刘西耕传去扣押，因为这样会妨碍报社与人民间的联系。
    根据以上情形我们认为：
    （一）关于陈小辰掐死小孩一事，据小辰说是她哥哥陈克堂指使的。当陈小辰和刘西耕结婚后，陈克堂又去责问小辰：“结婚为什么不和我商量？”并乘机向陈刘要十五石棒子（后改为一石棒子和一斗麦子），其后又带村干民兵将陈刘拘押。这不仅说明他非法干涉陈刘婚姻，且是抄袭了旧社会中借“寡妇改嫁”进行敲诈勒索的恶习。
    （二）疙疸村村干民兵，结合陈克堂到区告发，将陈刘非法拘捕扣押，并一再威胁陈刘“散伙”。这是违反婚姻法和保障人权的法令的。
    （三）区长虽然承认了陈刘的婚姻，但在观点上是不够明确的。而对陈克堂和村干的这种封建落后思想及妨害婚姻自由的行为，并未予以批评教育，反叫陈刘回村向群众坦白。这在实际上对陈刘婚姻起着压制的作用。
    （四）霸县人民法庭对陈刘婚姻案件的处理，同样表现了封建落后思想，采取非难的态度。在实际处理当中，没有正确地宣传人民政府的婚姻政策，教育干部和群众；却只根据村干的片面要求，就以溺婴罪判小辰徒刑半年，客观上迎合了村干的落后思想；不仅对陈克堂和村干的妨害婚姻和乱捕乱押的行为未予置问，而在判处小辰溺婴的判决书上开头就说：“被告作风不正，……夫死不到一年，即与其嫂带来之子通奸。该犯的丈夫已死，就该明媒改嫁，……”；在他们给天津日报的更正信中也有同样说法。这不但与溺婴罪责无关，相反地，正是对陈刘婚姻的一种非难。
    最高人民法院的意见河北省人民法院杜院长：
    关于陈小辰刘西耕的婚姻案件，经本院派刑事审判庭杨显之组长，会同你院刘国坤同志前往天津专区分院再往霸县进行调查，业已提出报告，经本院审查后，提出以下几点意见：
    （一）霸县疙疸村村干对陈小辰和刘西耕的婚姻问题，由于封建落后思想，采取了非难乃至干涉的行为，这表现在对待陈刘双方均无配偶的一种自主自愿的结合，认为是通奸私逃，加以捕押，并施用压力要他们“散伙”。第六区区长虽一方面承认其婚姻，而另一方面又令陈刘回村向群众坦白认错。这样处理问题，显然仍是迁就了疙疸村村干部封建落后思想的调和态度，而实质上是对陈刘自主自愿的婚姻采取了非难的处置。人民法院应当是坚定的站在反封建的立场上，处理人民的婚姻关系，保障人民的正当权益；而霸县人民法院，对陈刘的婚姻，仍沾染封建思想，以“其夫死去不到一年”及“就应该明媒改嫁”等封建性的判词（即是责小辰夫死为何不守寡或不多守寡几年，及非有“明媒”不能改嫁。）依附在毫不相关的处理陈小辰的溺婴案上。我们综合陈刘婚姻关系全案加以研究，认为处理陈小辰的溺婴是对陈刘婚姻关系不满的一种借题发挥。当然，溺婴是种犯罪行为，对溺婴的给以法律上的制裁是应该的。但陈的溺婴，应由其兄陈克堂多负其责。调查报告称：“据小辰说：当时小孩生下后，小辰曾向陈克堂说：‘哥哥，我给你丢人了，生下孩子了。’陈克堂说：‘把孩子掐死。’小辰说：‘不掐死，孩子是刘西耕的，我要寻他。’陈克堂说：‘你领着阎增玉（指陈的前夫）的孩子好好过吧。’这样，小辰就把孩子掐死。”这一段话虽出于小辰，而陈克堂不肯承认，据理据情，这是完全可以相信的。因此，可认定陈小辰的溺婴，不是陈的自愿，而是其兄陈克堂的教唆；不但是教唆，而且有家长权威的威胁（小辰结婚不敢问其兄陈克堂，及陈刘结婚后，陈克堂与阎增起到小辰家时的行为，就表现这一点）。因此我们认为溺婴罪责应由陈克堂负其主要责任，而霸县人民法院不加调查研究，单责陈小辰，判处其溺婴罪徒刑六个月，而置陈克堂于不问，这是一个很不公平的判决。这种不公平的判决是基于封建落后思想，表示对陈刘婚姻不满的一种借题发挥，且对陈的判处，不在溺婴的当时，而恰在陈溺婴后五个月陈刘发生婚姻关系的时候，这也可证明上述的论断。这都说明了县人民法院不仅没有站在反封建思想的立场上来正确处理陈刘婚姻问题，反进而以溺婴为题，判陈徒刑，实际上妨害了他们自主自愿的婚姻。这是值得引起注意的。
    （二）天津专署分院和霸县人民法院在处理陈刘婚姻问题上，还表现了官僚主义作风和侵犯人权的行为，如天津日报发表署名陈少云的信件后，天津分院竟不加调查，遽认刘系恶意攻击政府，擅将刘带去，羁押两天后，又移送霸县非法羁押达一个月又五天之久。在陈刘羁押期中，授意陈写更正信，并为代书，又为刘代书更正信，令捺指印后始予释放。这都是严重的官僚主义，命令主义的作风，都是侵犯人权的行为。
    （三）天津专署分院和霸县人民法院对天津日报发表陈小辰信件后，不从人民政府和人民报纸及其与人民的正确关系上去考虑问题，不本着“有则改之，无则加勉”的精神去认真检查工作中的缺点和错误，而只一味要求报社更正，并在传讯投书人之后，滥用职权，给予羁押。这种行为，严重的妨害了人民群众与报纸的联系，损害了人民政府的威信。
    基于以上认识，本院除将这一事件的调查结果在报纸公布外，并希你院详加研究，与省府商洽，使本案中与侵犯人权有关的干部，分别责任，受到应有的处分。并结合整风学习，责成有关干部深入检讨，并教育全体，以树立严肃的法治观念，提高干部的政策思想与实事求是的作风，并希将处理结果，详为具报。

    编者按  陈小辰与刘西耕婚姻案的前后经过，说明新婚姻法的贯彻实施，还需要进行很多斗争。不少区村干部以至县级以上干部、法院干部，由于脑子里残存着从旧社会带来的封建意识，在处理婚姻案件时往往不能正确执行婚姻法，甚至有意地用各种方法阻挠婚姻自由，侵犯人权，严重破坏婚姻法。我们完全赞同最高人民法院对此一案件的分析与处理意见，天津日报向本报提出的五个问题。也可由此得到解答。这一案件对于各地干部和群众都是很好的实际教材，而错误地处理该案的行政干部和司法干部更应从此吸取教训，进行深刻检讨，以免再犯错误，保证婚姻法的贯彻执行。
