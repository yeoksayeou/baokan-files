　　Correct the United Front Policy Overcome Bureaucratic Work Style
    CCP Committee of the Central South Military and Political Committee Determine Rectification Content Based on Departmental Characteristics
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Wuhan Yangtze Daily News: The CCP Committee of the directly subordinate organs of the Central South Military and Political Committee, based on the characteristics of the departments, determined that the main content of this rectification campaign is to correct the United Front policy and overcome bureaucracy. Because in this department, many cadres lack a correct understanding of the Party's United Front policy, which has resulted in a tendency towards closed-doorism. The specific manifestation is a lack of the spirit of democratic cooperation with non-Party members, a lack of courage to boldly use them, and even more a lack of active and regular assistance to enable them to give full play to their initiative and achieve results in their work. This kind of closed-doorism is quite common and hinders the government's work to the greatest extent. At the same time, there is also a phenomenon of unprincipled accommodation towards non-Party members. They do not pay attention to educating and transforming the shortcomings and mistakes of some of them, and do not help them improve politically. The bureaucratic work style of this department is mainly manifested in issuing orders without understanding the situation, relying solely on instructions and orders to solve problems, working busily without a central focus, and complicated procedures, slow handling of affairs, irresponsibility, and undemocratic practices. The above-mentioned deviations and work styles have seriously divorced cadres from the masses and affected the prestige of the Party and the government, which has become the main problem to be solved in this rectification campaign. The CCP Central South Bureau's Committee of Directly Subordinate Organs has also formulated a rectification plan based on the situation in its own department.

　　端正统一战线政策  克服官僚主义作风
    中南军政委员会中共党委会  根据部门特点确定整风内容
    【本报讯】据武汉长江日报消息：中南军政委员会直属机关中共党委会，根据部门的特点，确定此次整风的主要内容是端正统一战线政策与克服官僚主义。因为在该部门中，由于许多干部对党的统一战线政策缺乏正确的认识，因此产生了关门主义的偏向。其具体表现，就是缺乏和党外人士民主合作的精神，不敢大胆使用他们，更缺乏对他们积极的经常的帮助，使他们能够发挥积极性，在工作上做出成绩来。此种关门主义倾向相当普遍，对政府工作妨碍最大。同时，也存在着对党外人士无原则迁就的现象，对他们某些人发生的缺点和错误，不注意教育改造，帮助他们从政治上提高。该部门的官僚主义作风主要表现在不了解下情就发号施令、单纯依靠指示命令解决问题、工作忙忙碌碌没有中心以及手续繁杂、办事迟缓，不负责任、不民主等。上述偏向和作风使干部严重的脱离了群众，影响了党和政府的威信，这就成为此次整风中必须解决的主要问题。中共中央中南局直属机关委员会也根据本部门情况，制订了整风计划。
