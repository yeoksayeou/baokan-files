　　Anniversary of National Day Telegrams Charged at One-Third Rate
    In order to warmly celebrate this year's October 1st great National Day, the Telecommunications Bureau has decided that from 00:00 on September 28th to 24:00 on October 2nd, "Domestic Anniversary of National Day Congratulatory Telegrams" (unlimited number of words) will be available. The telegram text is limited to plain language purely congratulating the National Day, with the same time limit as ordinary political telegrams. The price will be charged at one-third of the ordinary telegram rate, and the translation fee will be waived. Both the distribution and full recording of the recipient's name and address services are applicable. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will make full use of this service.
