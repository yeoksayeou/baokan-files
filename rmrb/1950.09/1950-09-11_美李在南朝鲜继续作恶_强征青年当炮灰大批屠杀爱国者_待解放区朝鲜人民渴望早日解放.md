　　Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: According to a TASS dispatch from Tokyo: The American military in South Korea has organized frequent searches for youths aged seventeen to twenty-three. The Americans capture them in schools, fields, streets, and anywhere else. On August 15th, in several places, the Americans, under the guise of "gatherings" to celebrate the so-called "national" founding anniversary of South Korea, forced young people to participate and then surrounded and arrested them. The arrested South Korean youths are trained in American training centers in Korea; some are sent to Japan for two weeks of military preparatory training in American camps in Gunma and Yamanashi prefectures. It is reported that the Americans have transported more than six thousand South Korean youths to Japan. The action of forcibly conscripting and training South Korean youths is still continuing. Training centers turn out hundreds of young men every day. However, the vast majority of South Korean youths captured into the U.S. Army refuse to participate in combat against the Korean People's Army.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: TASS quoted Pyongyang Radio: Syngman Rhee's military police executed more than 3,000 Korean patriots imprisoned in Gwangju between July 7th and July 23rd.
　　Before dawn on July 7th, the military police came to Gwangju Prison, pretending to escort the prisoners to another area, and took them to a small mountain to be executed, where four large pits had already been dug. Before their deaths, the victims shouted, "Long live the People's Republic!" "Long live Kim Il-sung!" "Long live Korea!"
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 8th: According to Kim Nam-hee, who fled from the awaiting-liberation area of North Gyeongsang Province to Daejeon, the American aggressor troops and the Syngman Rhee puppet army commit savage atrocities such as burning, killing, raping, and pillaging wherever they flee. They also rob residents of all their food and valuables. In the areas they control, the number of old, weak, women, and children dying of hunger or groaning in the streets is increasing day by day. Without exception, young men over the age of seventeen are seized and used as cannon fodder. American devils and puppet military police arbitrarily attack civilians day and night, break into houses, loot property, and rape and kill women. The people in the awaiting-liberation area hate these bandits to the bone. They eagerly hope that the People's Army will liberate them as soon as possible and avenge them.

　　美李在南朝鲜继续作恶
    强征青年当炮灰大批屠杀爱国者
    待解放区朝鲜人民渴望早日解放
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社引东京消息：南朝鲜的美军已经组织了对十七岁至二十三岁的青年的经常搜捕。美国人在学校、田野、街上和任何其他地方，捕捉他们。八月十五日，在几个地方，美国人以“集会”庆祝所谓南朝鲜“国家”成立纪念日为名，强迫青年们参加，然后进行围捕。被捕去的南朝鲜青年在朝鲜的美国训练中心受训；有些则被送到日本去，在群马及山梨二县的美国军营中受两周军事预备训练。据报道：美国人已将六千多名南朝鲜青年运到日本。强征与训练南朝鲜青年的行动，仍在继续中。训练中心每天训练出数百名青年男子。但是，被捕捉到美国陆军内的南朝鲜青年，绝大多数拒绝参加对朝鲜人民军作战。
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社引平壤广播：李承晚宪兵自七月七日至二十三日期间，共枪杀被囚于光州的朝鲜爱国人士三千余人。
    七月七日黎明以前，宪兵来光州监狱，假装押解被囚者至另一地区，把他们带到一小山上执刑，当地已掘好四口大坑。被害人士临死前高呼：“人民共和国万岁”，“金日成万岁”，“朝鲜万岁”！
    【新华社平壤八日电】据自庆尚北道待解放区逃到大田的金南熙谈称：美国侵略军与李承晚伪军每自一个地方逃窜，便在当地进行烧杀奸淫等野兽暴行。他们并将居民的粮食、贵重物品统统抢走。在他们控制的地区内，因饥饿而死或呻吟于街头的老弱妇孺，日益增多。十七岁以上的青壮年无例外地被抓去充当炮灰。美国鬼子和伪宪兵不分昼夜地任意袭击平民，侵入民房，掠夺物品，将妇女强奸之后加以杀害。待解放区人民对于这些匪徒，恨之入骨。急盼人民军早日解放他们，并为他们报仇。
