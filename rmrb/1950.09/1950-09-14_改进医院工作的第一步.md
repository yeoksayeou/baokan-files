　　The First Step in Improving Hospital Work
    Over the past six months, the Beijing Municipal Third Hospital, Beijing Railway Hospital, North China People's Hospital, Peking University Hospital, Tianjin Municipal Third and Fourth Hospitals, and others have successively conducted comprehensive reviews and summaries of their work and formulated plans to improve their work, achieving preliminary results. This approach is worth referencing and learning from by other hospitals.

    In the past year, under the leadership of the People's Government, the work of these hospitals has improved considerably and achieved certain successes, but it is still far from meeting objective requirements. Generally speaking, the work system is unsound, the ideological style of the staff has not progressed enough, and there is a lack of a responsible spirit of serving patients. This seriously affects the health of patients, even endangering their lives, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses, and urgently needs to be improved in a planned and step-by-step manner.  Carefully reviewing and summarizing work is the primary step in improving work.

    From the review and summary reports of these hospitals, the central issue in improving hospital work at present is how to strengthen the ideological leadership of the staff, constantly enlighten and improve their consciousness. Experience has shown that when the leadership is tighter and the staff's political study is more successful, their understanding of medical work in New China is clearer, their work style and attitude are better, and their work results are greater. Peking University Hospital is an example. If the leadership has a bureaucratic style, fails to deeply understand the work and the situation of the cadres, fails to promote democracy, and fails to pay attention to the staff's learning, then the staff's ideological level will not be easily improved, it will not be easy to establish a stand and viewpoint of serving the people, it will be easy to cause disunity, and the work will not be easily done well. From this, it can be seen that to effectively improve hospital work, the leadership must first grasp the learning of all staff, closely integrate it with regular work, and continuously improve their consciousness in a planned and organized manner, strengthening their sense of responsibility to patients.  And on the basis of the consciousness of all staff, improve the system, promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, ideologically eliminate obstacles to unity, regularly conduct in-depth work inspections, constantly commend the good, criticize the bad, and promote the progress of work. This is the correct way to improve hospital work.

    The review and summary work of the above-mentioned hospitals provides very valuable experiences and lessons. It is hoped that the staff of all hospitals, especially the leading cadres, will deeply appreciate these experiences and lessons, work hard to improve their work, and gradually fulfill the glorious task of the people's medical workers.

### 改进医院工作的第一步

　　改进医院工作的第一步
    半年以来，北京市立第三医院、北京铁路医院、华北人民医院、北大医院、天津市立第三、第四医院等先后全面检查和总结了工作，并订出改进工作的计划，获得了初步的效果。这种措施是值得其他医院参考和学习的。
    一年以来，在人民政府的领导下，这些医院的工作都有相当的改进，获得了一定的成绩，但距离客观的要求还很远。一般说来，工作制度不健全，工作人员的思想作风进步不够，缺乏为病人服务的负责精神，严重影响了病人的健康，甚至危害病人的生命，引起了群众的很大不满，亟须有计划有步骤地加以改进。而认真检查和总结工作，就是改进工作的首要步骤。
    从这些医院的检查和总结报告看来，目前改进医院工作的中心问题就是如何加强对工作人员的思想领导，经常启发和提高他们的自觉。经验证明：凡是领导上抓得比较紧，工作人员的政治学习较有成绩，他们对新中国医务工作的认识比较清楚，他们的工作作风和工作态度就比较好，工作成绩就比较大。北大医院便是一个例子。如果领导上存在着官僚主义作风，不深入了解工作情况和干部情况，不发扬民主，不重视工作人员的学习，则工作人员的思想水平就不容易提高，不容易确立为人民服务的立场和观点，就容易闹不团结，工作就不容易搞好。由此可知，要有效地改进医院工作，领导上首先必须抓紧全体工作人员的学习，紧密结合经常工作，有计划有组织地不断提高他们的自觉，加强他们对病人的责任感。并在全体工作人员自觉的基础上健全制度，发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，从思想上扫除团结的障碍，经常进行深入的工作检查，不断表扬好的，批评坏的，推动工作前进。这就是改进医院工作的正确途径。
    上述医院的检查和总结工作，提供了非常宝贵的经验教训，希望各医院工作人员特别是领导干部深刻体会这些经验教训，努力改进工作，逐步完成人民的医务工作者的光荣任务。
