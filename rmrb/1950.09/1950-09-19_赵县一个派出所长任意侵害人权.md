To the Editor:

An incident violating the policy of the People's Government to protect human rights occurred in Zhao County, Hebei Province, involving Wang Lin, the head of the police station, and Jia Xiaoshou, a police officer.

The incident unfolded as follows: Zhang Qiufang and Ma Lange (sisters-in-law) from Xiguan Village in the Chengguan District, went to the police station on July 21 to file complaints due to a fight. The police station immediately mediated. However, Ma Lange returned to the police station alone after a short time at home, accusing Zhang Qiufang of stealing a piece of her cloth.

On August 14, Jia Xiaoshou of the police station saw Zhang Qiufang at the market and summoned her to the station for questioning. Zhang Qiufang denied the theft. With many onlookers present, Jia Xiaoshou, fearing the loss of his "authority," became very angry and threatened her by slamming the table, saying, "Someone saw you steal it, and you still deny it! You woman are truly cunning; I'll have you strung up.” Zhang Qiufang still didn't admit it. Xiaoshou then detained her and her child. At noon, the station chief, Wang Lin, interrogated Qiufang again: "Where did you take the cloth you stole from Ma Lange?" Qiufang said, "I didn't steal it." Wang Lin, seeing that she didn't admit it, threatened, "Three people saw you steal it, and you still deny it!?" Qiufang asked, "Who are the witnesses?" Wang Lin became furious and said, "What are you? Who would be your witness? I am your witness. I've already investigated this matter. If you don't confess, I'll send you to the People's Court to be detained..." Qiufang then burst into tears. At night, Qiufang's husband asked someone to go to the police station to persuade Qiufang to admit to the theft and compensate the woman with a new piece of cloth; otherwise, she wouldn't be released, and the child would starve. As a result, Qiufang confessed. The station chief, Wang Lin, immediately ordered her to return the stolen item within three days. To be released quickly, Qiufang had no choice but to agree. The next day, she heard her husband say: "Chief Wang said that if the original item is not returned within three days, the case will not be closed." Upon hearing this, Qiufang felt increasingly ashamed; since she hadn’t stolen anything there was no original item to return, she secretly hanged herself. Fortunately, her husband discovered her early and rescued her. She only regained consciousness half an hour later (with blood coming from her mouth and nose).

After this incident occurred, the police station reported it to the Public Security Bureau, but instead of humbly examining their actions, they distorted the facts, concealed information from their superiors, and claimed that Qiufang's suicide attempt was intentionally causing trouble for the police station. They even said that even if Qiufang had really died by hanging herself, it wouldn't be their responsibility. The illegal actions and dishonest attitude of Wang Lin and Jia Xiaoshou of the police station in concealing information from superiors should be appropriately punished by the Zhao County government. They should also be held accountable to humbly examine and correct their mistakes in this rectification campaign.

### 赵县一个派出所长任意侵害人权

　　赵县一个派出所长任意侵害人权编者同志：
    河北赵县城内发生了一件派出所所长王林、所员贾小寿违反人民政府保障人权政策的事件。
    事件的经过是这样的：城关区西关村张秋芳和马兰鸽（系妯娌），七月二十一日因打架同到派出所申诉。该所当即给她们调解了。可是马兰鸽回家呆了一会，又单独返回派出所，告张秋芳偷了她一件布衫。
    八月十四日，派出所贾小寿见张秋芳来赶集，即把她叫到所内讯问，可是张秋芳不承认偷窃。当时观众很多，贾小寿恐怕失掉自己的“威严”，竟对她大发脾气，拍着桌子威吓她说：“有人见你偷的，你还不承认！你这妇人真是狡滑，非把你吊起来不成。”张秋芳仍没承认。小寿便把她和她的小孩一并扣押起来。晌午，所长王林又传问秋芳：“你从马兰鸽那里偷来的那件布衫，弄到那里去了？”秋芳说：“没偷。”王林见她不承认，便威吓她说：“有三个人见你偷了，还不承认！？”秋芳问：“见证人是谁？”王林就大发脾气地说：“你什么东西，谁给你当证人？我就是你的见证人。这事我早调查好了，你要是不说，送你到人民法院扣起来……”秋芳便大哭起来。天黑时，秋芳的丈夫托人到派出所，叫秋芳承认这事，赔人家一件新布衫就算了；不然出不去，饿坏了孩子。结果秋芳承认了。所长王林即令其在三天内交回原物。秋芳为要快出去，只好答应了。第二天又听她丈夫说：“王所长说，三天内交不回原物，案子不算了结。”秋芳听了，越想越没脸见人；原物又交不回，便偷偷地上吊了。幸亏她丈夫发觉得早，把她救下了。半点钟后她才苏醒过来（口鼻都出了血）。
    这一事件发生后，该所曾向公安局作了报告，但该所不但不虚心检讨，反歪曲事实，隐瞒上级，认为秋芳上吊寻死，是故意给派出所找麻烦。还说秋芳即使真的上吊死了，与他们也没多大关系。该所王林、贾小寿这种违法行为和隐瞒上级的不老实态度，应请赵县政府给以适当的处分。并责成他们在这次整风中，虚心检讨与纠正自己的错误。
