　　Shanxi Grain Depot Cadres Meet to Discuss
    Strengthening Post-Summer Storage of Public Grain
    [This newspaper's Taiyuan report] The Shanxi Provincial Grain Bureau is currently holding a meeting of grain depot cadres from all districts throughout the province to study issues related to public grain storage after the summer harvest, in order to strengthen the storage of public grain. The task of summer grain storage in the province has now been basically completed successfully. In view of the fact that new wheat is most prone to heating and insect infestation in September and October, and that autumn-collected millet and various miscellaneous grains from last year are also undergoing changes, grain storage is the primary task of the grain department at present. According to reports from Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Wenshui, Shilou, and Jinyuan counties in the Fenyang Special District recently, 2.95 million jin of millet and over 230,000 jin of wheat have surface insect infestations, and 40,000 jin of corn have weevil infestations. A July inspection report from Changzhi Special District also showed that over 500,000 jin of grain were beginning to be infested. Similar situations exist in other areas; individual counties are showing signs of mold and rot due to damp warehouses. Furthermore, in Xingxian Special District, Xing and Lan counties suffered losses due to rainwater flooding three warehouses as a result of neglecting inspections during the rainy season. It was also reported during the summer storage that wheat in Jie County began to develop moths immediately upon entering the warehouse. At the same time, grain depot storage personnel at all levels in various regions lack both scientific storage knowledge and complete and accurate experience in the face of highly concentrated grain storage, and are therefore at a loss in their work. Therefore, in addition to immediately introducing several prevention and control experiences and methods for trial implementation and instructing improvements in grain storage stacking methods, the Provincial Bureau, in order to correct cadres' thinking, improve technology, strengthen storage, and prevent national public grain from being damaged, convened a meeting of responsible storage cadres from sub-depots throughout the province starting on August 21st. The main purpose is to integrate and improve scientific knowledge on the basis of summarizing local methods of insect and rot prevention in various regions, combine experience with science, and improve work. The meeting is expected to last a total of 20 days.

　　山西粮库干部集会研讨
    加强夏屯后公粮保管
    【本报太原讯】山西省粮食局为加强各地夏屯后的公粮保管，现正召开全省各区粮库干部会议，研究有关公粮保管问题。该省夏屯入库任务，目前已基本上胜利结束，鉴于新麦在九、十月份最易发热、生虫，且去年秋征小米及各种杂粮亦正在发生变化，粮食保管实为目前粮食部门的首要任务。最近据汾阳专区汾阳、孝义、文水、石楼、晋源等县反映：有二百九十五万斤小米，二十三万余斤小麦，表层生虫；四万斤玉茭生铁嘴虫。长治专区七月份检查报告，也有五十余万斤粮食开始生虫。其他地区也有类似情况；个别县因库房潮湿，将有发生霉烂的征象。其次兴县专区的兴、岚二县，因雨季疏忽检查，三个库被雨水灌仓受到损失。又在夏屯时据反映：解县小麦刚入库即生了蛾。同时，各地各级粮库保管人员，在粮食高度集中的情况下，既缺乏科学保管知识，又少完整准确的经验，因而工作中感到束手无策。因此，省局除立即介绍几种防治经验与办法以供试行，并指示改善粮食保管堆积方法外，为端正干部思想，提高技术，加强保管，使国家公粮免受损失起见，于八月二十一日起召集全省各区分库保管负责干部会议，主要是在总结各地防虫、防腐等土办法的基础上，贯彻科学知识，使经验与科学结合，加以提高，改进工作。会议预计共开二十天。
