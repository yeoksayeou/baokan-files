　　Persistently Implement the Policy of Mobilizing Both Male and Female Peasants Together

    I. Why Mobilize Women in Peasant Households to Participate in Land Reform?

    This winter, land reform will be implemented in areas with approximately 100 million agricultural people. This is a large-scale mass movement and also a systematic and fierce struggle. To thoroughly abolish the landlord class's feudal exploitation of ownership and implement the peasants' land ownership, a strong and powerful land reform team is necessary to complete this great historical task. In this team, the decisive factor is the peasant masses, and women, who account for half of the population, are a great and indispensable force. If the power of women is mobilized and organized, the strength of land reform will be increased. Otherwise, women will not only be ineffective, but also affect the mobilization and organization of male peasants. In this way, the strength of the land reform team will be dispersed and weakened. Therefore, to do a good job in land reform, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, and the success of women's mobilization is a sign of the success of mass mobilization.

    The land reform movement is a movement for the peasant masses to turn themselves around. For thousands of years, peasants who have suffered cruel oppression and exploitation must thoroughly turn themselves around in the land reform, obtain economic and political rights, and seek their own liberation. Both male and female peasants must rise up to liberate themselves. If women are not mobilized in the land reform movement, they cannot truly obtain the rights they deserve, and even if they are given rights, they will not dare or know how to use them. Therefore, all appropriate and effective methods must be used to enlighten women's consciousness, so that they can actively participate in the land reform movement, turn themselves around together with the peasants, and seek liberation. In this way, after the land reform, women will exert greater power to participate in the agricultural production movement, which is of great significance to the country's agricultural production and construction.

    II. Two Different Mobilization Methods and Different Results

    The importance of mobilizing women to participate in land reform, this principle is easily accepted by general cadres, but it is not easy to implement. Based on past land reform experience, there are roughly two different leadership methods, which result in two different outcomes.

    The first type is to mobilize together, that is, to mobilize women at the same time as mobilizing peasants. Whether it is in publicizing land reform policies, organizing and rectifying peasant associations, classifying classes, entering the confiscation and requisition stage, or distributing land, women should be enlightened and educated at the same time as mobilizing peasants; and special attention should be paid to the degree of women's mobilization, putting in extra effort to raise them to the same level as the peasants. With this leadership method, the general situation in villages with good work is as follows: young, middle-aged, and elderly women widely participate in the land reform movement, actively participate in various meetings, are very concerned about the issues discussed in the meetings, and dare to express their own opinions. A large number of activists have emerged in the movement, and many have participated in leadership work, serving as team leaders, representatives, and even chairpersons. They generally work actively, enthusiastically, carefully, and are capable of handling affairs; they often take the lead in grievance meetings; in the struggle against local bullies and landlords, most women can break through emotional barriers and dare to accuse. When it comes to issues related to women's due rights, they actively stand up to fight for them; dare to criticize incorrect opinions; they are very responsible for their obligations. They can play a role in participating in production and completing national tasks. Therefore, the entire masses are mobilized well, with full enthusiasm, unity, and a new atmosphere.

    The second type is men first, women second, that is, to mobilize male peasants first, and then mobilize women after the men have risen up; or women spontaneously rise up with the movement and show an active role, which then attracts the attention of the leadership; or it is believed that after the male peasants are mobilized, they can naturally bring the women along. In villages where this approach is taken, most women participate in the movement, but their consciousness is not high, and they have not fully exerted their enthusiasm, especially elderly women, some of whom are still standing outside the movement. The number of activists participating in leadership work is not large, and the quality is not high. Only a few people dare to speak at various meetings. Most women have not yet realized their own strength and dare not fight for their due interests; in short, they are one step behind male peasants in all aspects. In some villages, even most women have not been mobilized. A few who participated in the movement were mostly passive, attending meetings mostly as listeners. A few who dared to speak would also look at their husbands' faces. There are very few activists, and some representatives are ineffective, afraid of hurting people in the struggle, and some pull their husbands' legs. In the family, they are still hindered by their mothers-in-law and husbands and dare not attend meetings. Individual women even become air-raid shelters for landlords, affecting the deepening and development of the entire movement.

    Among the above two leadership methods, the second type accounted for the majority in the areas where land reform was implemented in the past. Why is there such an incorrect approach? This is because some cadres participating in land reform have deviations in their views on rural mass movements. They do not regard mobilizing women as an indispensable part of the mass movement and do not recognize the role and power of women in the movement. They believe that as long as the peasants are mobilized, the entire masses will rise up, and there is no need to pay special attention to the situation of women's mobilization. Some even believe that mobilizing women is an extra burden. These are all due to the remnants of feudal ideas of valuing men over women. Therefore, to thoroughly eliminate the feudal exploitation of the land system, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the feudal remnants in the minds of these cadres before land reform work can be done well.

    III. How to Implement the Policy of Mobilizing Both Male and Female Peasants Together

    How to implement the leadership method of mobilizing both male and female peasants together and correct incorrect practices such as men first, women second, and natural mobilization? Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report "On the Question of Land Reform" contains extremely important instructions. He said: "Peasant associations should earnestly pay attention to absorbing women from peasant households to participate and absorb activists from among women to participate in leadership work." This means that at the beginning of publicizing land reform policies in rural areas and rectifying the land reform team, peasant associations should absorb peasant women and produce their own female leaders. How can this be done well? The key lies in the leadership ideology of the land reform organs at all levels and the thinking of the cadres participating in land reform. If the leaders and cadres (East China and Central South regions are preparing and training 180,000 cadres to participate in land reform after this autumn) attach importance to the work of mobilizing women, then a large part of the problem will be solved. Now, the reports of the responsible comrades of the Central Committee and the major administrative regions attach great importance to the work of mobilizing women. The East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has specifically issued the "Instructions on Strengthening Women's Work During the Preparation Period for Land Reform." We hope that this spirit can be implemented in all provinces, counties, and districts, all the way to the village peasant associations; and we hope that land reform training courses in various places will include the work of mobilizing women as one of the learning contents when studying land reform policies. We believe that this land reform will accept the rich experience of past land reforms and will definitely be able to mobilize women and mobilize them well. For this reason, I will talk about a few issues of understanding on mobilizing women:

    Some comrades believe that mobilizing women is a matter for women cadres, and it is inconvenient for male comrades to do women's work. Is this view correct? No, it is not correct. Mobilizing the masses of women in the land reform movement is actually a part of mass work. If the masses (even half of whom are women) do not rise up, it is difficult to imagine that land reform work can be done well. Therefore, mobilizing the masses of women is not something that can be done well by relying on a few women cadres alone. Of course, women cadres should play an exemplary role in mobilizing women, but the work of mobilizing women must be taken as the task of all cadres in order to be done well. Some male cadres say: It is inconvenient for me to approach women. But this difficulty can be overcome. Because rural production and life are based on families. When talking to male peasants, you will encounter women. As long as you attach importance to this work in your thinking, you will publicize it to her, and you will also mobilize women through peasants. Or mobilize the masses of women by setting up women's committees in peasant associations or convening women's representative meetings. Therefore, there are many opportunities to approach women and methods of mobilization. Facts have proved that the so-called concerns about inconvenience are unnecessary.

    Some comrades say: Women are "backward," troublesome, verbose, and difficult to mobilize. They can only be brought along naturally after the male peasants rise up. Is this view correct? No, it is not correct. Let's analyze whether women are "backward." Generally speaking, compared with men, women are more backward due to the limitations of social and historical conditions, but from a specific class perspective, the deeper the oppression and exploitation, the easier it is to enlighten their consciousness. Then, women from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds suffer deeper oppression than male peasants, and they urgently demand liberation. They are easy to enlighten. The view that they are "backward" is wrong. In the past land reform movement, a large number of working women from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds became activists in land reform, were supported by the masses, elected as chairpersons of peasant associations, village chiefs, and even district chiefs, and became excellent cadres. It can be seen that women from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds are the most outstanding and advanced members of the masses of women, but their consciousness and their progress must be improved through enlightenment and education. The saying that they can be brought along naturally is also incorrect.

    Other difficulties such as being troublesome, verbose, and difficult to mobilize do exist, such as they have family affairs, are burdened by children, hindered by mothers-in-law and husbands, and have many concerns, etc. These are different from peasants. As long as we patiently help and take care of their difficulties, and put in more effort than male peasants to carry out our work, then the difficulties can be overcome. It is the correct attitude to not shirk responsibility and try to overcome difficulties when encountering them.

    In short, with the leadership organs of land reform at all levels attaching importance to the work of mobilizing women, coupled with cadres making their thinking clear, we believe that the work of mobilizing women in this year's land reform movement will definitely be more successful than in the past. Oppressed and exploited peasants will enthusiastically devote themselves to the land reform movement for their own liberation and thoroughly eliminate the feudal exploitation of the land system; after land reform, women will participate in large-scale production movements together with the peasants, laying a solid foundation for the country's economic construction and for consolidating the victory of the people's revolution.

### 坚持贯彻男女农民一齐发动的方针

专栏：《新中国妇女》社论

　　坚持贯彻男女农民一齐发动的方针
    一  为什么要发动农民家庭中的妇女参加土地改革
    今年冬季约有一万万农业人口的地区实行土地改革，这是一个大规模的群众运动，也是一场系统的激烈的斗争。要彻底废除地主阶级封建剥削的所有制，实行农民的土地所有制，必须有一支坚强有力的土地改革队伍，才能完成这个伟大的历史任务。在这个队伍中，起决定作用的是农民群众，而占人口一半的妇女是一支伟大的不可忽视的力量。如果把妇女的力量发动与组织起来，就增加了土地改革的力量，否则，妇女不但不起作用，还影响男农民的发动与组织，这样，土地改革队伍的力量就分散和削弱了。所以要做好土地改革，必须充分发动群众，而妇女发动的好坏，乃是群众发动好坏的标志。
    土地改革运动是农民群众的翻身运动，几千年来受尽残酷压迫与剥削的农民要在土地改革中彻底翻身，获得经济、政治的权利，以求得自己的解放；必须男女农民自己起来解放自己。如果在土地改革运动中，没有把妇女发动起来，她们就不能真正获得应得的权利，甚至给她们权利也不敢或不会应用。因此要用一切适当有效的方法去启发妇女的自觉，使她们积极投入土地改革运动中来，才能和农民一齐翻身，才能求得解放。这样，在土地改革后，妇女将发挥更大的力量，参加农业生产运动，这对国家的农业生产建设是有极大意义的。
    二  两种不同的发动方法和不同的结果
    发动妇女参加土地改革的重要性，这个道理一般干部是容易接受的，但做起来却不容易贯彻，根据过去土地改革的经验，大体上有两种不同的领导方法，因而产生两种不同的结果。
    第一种，一齐发动，即开始发动农民时，就发动妇女。无论在宣传土地改革政策、组织和整顿农民协会、划阶级、进入没收征收、分配土地各方面，都和发动农民同时去启发、教育妇女；并特别注意妇女发动的程度，多加一把力，把她们提高到和农民一样的水平。用这样的领导方法，工作好的村庄，大体情况是这样：青壮年及老年妇女普遍的参加了土地改革运动，参加各种会议很踊跃，对会议中讨论的问题很关心，并敢于提出自己的意见。在运动中涌现了大批积极分子，很多参加了领导工作，担任组长、代表、甚至主席。她们一般的工作积极热情、细心，有办事能力；在诉苦会上，她们往往起带头作用；在斗争恶霸地主的场合，多数妇女能撕破情面，敢于控诉。关系到妇女应得的权利问题时，她们积极起来争取；敢批评不正确的意见；她们对自己应尽的义务，很负责任。在参加生产，完成国家任务时，都能起作用。因此整个群众发动的很好，情绪饱满，团结一致，一片新气象。
    第二种，先男后女，即先发动男农民，等男的起来后，才去发动妇女；或妇女随着运动自发的起来，并表现了积极作用，才引起领导上的注意；或认为男农民发动起来后，自然可以把妇女带起来。这样做法的村庄，大部分妇女虽然参加了运动，但自觉性不高，没有充分发挥她们的积极性，特别是老年妇女，有的还站在运动之外。积极分子参加领导工作的数量不多，质量不高。在各种会议上敢于说话的只是几个人。大多数妇女还没有认识到自己的力量，对自己应得的利益不敢争取；总之，她们在各方面比男农民落后了一步。有的村庄，甚至大多数妇女没有发动起来。少数参加了运动，也多是被动的，参加会议，多是旁听。个别敢讲话的，也要看丈夫的脸色。积极分子很少，有个把代表，有的不起作用，在斗争中怕伤人，有的拉丈夫的腿。在家庭中仍然受婆婆丈夫的阻碍，不敢去参加会议。个别妇女甚至当地主的防空洞，影响了整个运动的深入与开展。
    以上两种领导方法，在过去实行土地改革的地区，第二种占多数，为什么会有这种不正确的做法呢？这是由于有些参加土改的干部对农村群众运动的看法有偏差，他们没有把发动妇女看成群众运动中不可缺少的一部分，没有认识妇女在运动中的作用和力量。他们认为只要把农民发动起来，整个群众就起来了，用不着特别去注意妇女发动的情况，甚至认为发动妇女是额外的负担，这些，都是由于重男轻女的封建思想残余在作祟。因此，要彻底消灭封建剥削的土地制度，必须先彻底肃清这些干部思想中的封建残余，才能做好土地改革工作。
    三  如何贯彻男女农民一齐发动的方针
    如何贯彻男女农民一齐发动的领导方法，纠正先男后女、自然带动等不正确的做法，这点在刘少奇同志《关于土地改革问题》的报告中有极重要的指示。他说：“农民协会应切实注意吸收农民家庭中的妇女来参加，并吸收妇女中的积极分子来参加领导工作。”这就是说，在农村宣传土地改革政策，整顿土地改革队伍的开始，农民协会就应该把农妇吸收进来，并产生妇女自己的领导人物。如何能把这条做好？决定的关键在各级执行土地改革机关的领导思想，和参加土地改革的干部思想。如果说领导思想和干部（华东、中南两区今年秋后准备和训练参加土地改革的干部就有十八万）都重视了发动妇女的工作，那问题就解决了一大半。现在中央及大行政区负责同志关于土地改革的报告中，都极重视发动妇女的工作，中共中央华东局特发出《关于在土地改革准备时期加强妇女工作的指示》。我们希望这个精神能贯彻到各省、县、区，一直到村农民协会中去；并希望各地土地改革训练班，在学习土地改革政策时，把发动妇女的工作作为学习内容之一。我们相信这次土地改革，接受过去土地改革的丰富经验，一定能把妇女发动起来，并发动得很好。为此，谈几点对发动妇女的认识问题：
    有的同志认为发动妇女是妇女干部的事，男同志不方便做妇女工作。这种看法是否对呢？不，不对的。在土地改革运动中发动妇女群众，实际上是群众工作的一部分，如果群众（即便是半数的妇女）不起来，能做好土地改革工作是很难想像的。因此，发动妇女群众，不是光靠几个妇女干部能做好的事。当然，妇女干部应在发动妇女中起模范作用，但必须把发动妇女的工作当作全体干部的任务来做，才能做好。有的男干部说：我不便接近妇女。但这种困难是可以克服的。因为农村的生产、生活都是以家庭为单位的。找男农民谈话，就会遇到妇女，只要思想上重视这件工作，就会向她宣传，也会通过农民去发动妇女。或在农民协会设妇女委员或召开妇女代表会议等方式去发动妇女群众。因此，接近妇女的机会和发动的方法是很多的。事实证明，所谓不方便的顾虑是不必要的。
    有的同志说：妇女群众“落后”，麻烦，罗嗦，不好发动，只有男农民起来后，就自然会带动起来。这种看法是否对呢？不，不对的。我们分析一下妇女群众是否“落后”。从一般的男女比较来说，因社会历史条件的限制，妇女是比男子落后些，但从具体的阶级来看，受压迫剥削愈深重，他们的觉悟也愈容易启发。那么，贫雇农出身的妇女，她们所受的压迫比男农民还深重，她们迫切要求解放，她们是容易启发的。那种认为她们“落后”的观点是错误的。在过去土地改革运动中，大批贫雇农出身的劳动妇女成为土地改革的积极分子，为群众所拥护，选为农会主席、村长、甚至区长，成了优秀的干部，可见贫雇农出身的妇女是妇女群众中最优秀最先进的分子，但她们的觉悟，她们的进步，必须经过启发教育才能提高，那种自然带动的说法也是不对的。
    其他麻烦、罗嗦、不好发动的困难是有的，如她们有家庭事务，孩子拖累，婆婆丈夫阻碍，顾虑多等等，这些是和农民不同的，只要我们耐心帮助，照顾她们的困难，比男农民多加一把力去进行工作，那么，困难是可以克服的。遇到困难，不推诿责任，想法克服困难，这才是正确的态度。
    总之，各级土地改革的领导机关重视发动妇女的工作，再加上干部搞通思想，我们相信，今年在土地改革运动中发动妇女的工作一定比过去做得更有成绩。被压迫和被剥削的农民将为自己的解放，热烈地投入土地改革运动中，彻底消灭封建剥削的土地制度；土地改革后，妇女将和农民一道参加大规模的生产运动，为国家经济建设，为巩固人民革命的胜利打下坚固的基础。
