Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 29th: The Security Council held a meeting on September 27th at the request of Soviet representative Malik.

Malik said that he requested the meeting to discuss two issues: "The Case of Accusing Armed Aggression Against Taiwan" and "The Case of Accusing Aggression Against the Republic of Korea." Regarding the first issue, the Soviet Union is willing to raise the issue of inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the Taiwan issue. Regarding the second issue, the Soviet Union intends to discuss its proposal regarding the U.S.'s barbaric bombing of Korea.

Since the Security Council has already agreed to include the above two issues on the agenda, Malik pointed out that before discussing the substance of the Taiwan issue, the Security Council must first consider the procedural issue of inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Security Council's discussion of this issue. Malik recounted the People's Republic of China's filing of this accusation with the Security Council and cited a telegram from Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China. He then emphasized that it is impossible for the Security Council to discuss the Taiwan issue without the participation of China, which filed the accusation. U.S. representative Gross requested the Soviet delegation to explain the nature of the accusation at the previous meeting of the Security Council; Malik said in response to this request that the United States should directly request a reply from the representative of the People's Republic of China. To make this possible, the Security Council should invite the Chinese representative to participate, and the Chinese representative would undoubtedly give a detailed reply.

Malik pointed out that since mid-August, the U.S. delegation and representatives of the Kuomintang remnants have been obstructing the proposal to invite Chinese representatives to participate, and they are now using various excuses and means to obstruct the Security Council from making a decision on this issue. The Soviet representative said that the crux of the problem lies in inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China. The sooner this issue is resolved, the sooner the Security Council can review the accusation of the Taiwan issue. The review of this issue does not hinder the General Assembly's discussion of the U.S. aggression against China. The issue of U.S. aggression against China will be discussed by a special committee of the General Assembly. This does not prevent the Security Council from dealing with the Taiwan issue. The Security Council can and must deal with the problems it faces. Malik concluded by saying that the Soviet Union firmly advocates that the Security Council immediately and without delay approve the decision to invite the People's Republic of China to participate in the Security Council meetings related to the Taiwan issue.

Security Council Chairman Jebb proposed that the Security Council should first decide whether to delete the Taiwan issue from the issues it is considering, and then decide on the Soviet proposal to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China.

Ecuadorian representative Quevedo insisted on a "compromise solution," according to which the Taiwan issue would not be "deleted" from the Security Council's agenda, but should be postponed until the first meeting of the Security Council after the re-election on December 1st.

Quevedo also proposed that representatives of the People's Republic of China should be allowed to participate in the Security Council meetings after December 1, 1950. The Ecuadorian delegation included all these proposals in his proposal, which is for consideration when discussing the accusation of armed aggression against Taiwan.

Chiang Ting-fu of the Kuomintang opposed Ecuador's proposal and put forward his "amendment" to this proposal, but Quevedo refused to amend it, so the Kuomintang withdrew his "amendment".

Jebb proposed that the Security Council should first vote on Ecuador's first point regarding the proposal to postpone consideration of the Taiwan issue, and then vote on the Soviet proposal regarding the invitation of representatives of the People's Republic of China.

However, Malik pointed out that according to the rules of the Security Council, the main motions should have priority in the order in which they are presented. He pointed out that the Soviet Union had proposed that the Security Council should invite representatives of the People's Republic of China before Ecuador's proposal was put forward. Therefore, the Soviet proposal should be voted on first. He said that regarding the substance of Ecuador's proposal, the Soviet delegation is willing to discuss it in more detail at the next Security Council meeting.

After some brief discussions, the Security Council decided to reconvene on the afternoon of September 28 and adjourned.

　　安理会讨论控美侵台案程序问题
    苏联坚持应邀我国参加讨论
    美国以种种借口和无耻手段阻我出席
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：安理会应苏联代表马立克之请，在九月二十七日举行会议。
    马立克说：他请求举行会议是为了要讨论二个问题：“控诉武装侵略台湾案”和“控诉对朝鲜共和国侵略案”。关于第一个问题，苏联愿意提出邀请中华人民共和国代表参加台湾问题讨论的问题。关于第二个问题，苏联心目中想讨论的是它的关于美国野蛮轰炸朝鲜的提案。
    由于安理会业已同意将上述两个问题列入议程，马立克指出，在进行讨论台湾问题的实质之前，安理会必须先考虑邀请中华人民共和国代表参加安理会关于这一问题的讨论这一程序问题。马立克追述中华人民共和国向安理会提出这一控诉案，并引证中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来的来电，接着他强调说：如果没有提出控诉案的中国参加，安理会要讨论台湾问题是不可能的。美国代表葛罗斯在安理会前次会议上曾要求苏联代表团解释控诉案的性质；马立克在回答这个要求时说：美国应当直接向中华人民共和国代表请求答复，为使这件事有可能办到，安理会应当邀请中国代表参加，中国代表无疑是会作详细的答复的。
    马立克指出：从八月中旬以来，美国代表团和国民党残余分子的代表一直在阻挠邀请中国代表参加的提案，他们现在又在用种种借口和手段阻挠安理会对这个问题作决定。苏联代表说：问题的症结在于邀请中华人民共和国的代表。这个问题愈早得到解决，安理会就能愈早对台湾问题的控诉案进行审议。对这个问题的审议并不妨碍大会对美国侵略中国问题的讨论。美国侵略中国的问题将由大会特别委员会讨论。这并不妨碍安理会处理台湾问题。安理会能够、同时也必须处理它自己所面临的问题。马立克在结语中说：苏联坚决主张安理会立即毫不延迟地批准邀请中华人民共和国参加安理会有关台湾问题的会议的决定。
    安理会主席杰伯提议：安理会应首先决定是否从它所考虑的问题中删去台湾问题，然后再决定苏联所提邀请中华人民共和国代表的提议。
    厄瓜多尔代表奎维铎坚持“折衷办法”，按照这个办法，台湾问题将不从安理会议程中“删去”，但应该延迟到十二月一日以后安理会改选后首次会议再行讨论。
    奎维铎又提议：在一九五○年十二月一日以后应准许中华人民共和国代表参加安理会会议。厄瓜多尔代表团把所有这些提议都列在他的提案里，这提案是供讨论控诉武装侵略台湾案时考虑的。
    国民党的蒋廷黻反对厄瓜多尔的提案，并提出他对这一提案的“修正”，但奎维铎拒绝修正，于是国民党撤回了他的“修正”。
    杰伯提议：安理会应首先表决厄瓜多尔的第一点关于延迟考虑台湾问题的提议，然后再表决苏联所提关于邀请中华人民共和国代表的提议。
    然而马立克指出：根据安理会的规则，主要的动议按照提出的先后应享有优先权。他指出：早在厄瓜多尔的提议提出以前，苏联即已提出安理会应邀请中华人民共和国代表的提议，因此应首先表决苏联的提案。他说，关于厄瓜多尔提议的实质，苏联代表团愿在下一次安理会会议上更详尽的讨论。
    又经过一些简短的讨论后，安理会决定在九月二十八日下午再开会，遂即宣告休会。
