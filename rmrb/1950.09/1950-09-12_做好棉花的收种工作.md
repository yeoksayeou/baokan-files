　　Do a Good Job in Cotton Harvesting and Planting
　　Industrial Raw Materials Department of the Central Ministry of Agriculture
　　At the National Cotton Production Conference, it was decided that this autumn, in all national fine seed management areas, 1,020,000 dan of fine cotton seeds should be purchased and recovered (those loaned out this spring). It is estimated that the fine seed area next year can reach 19 million mu. To ensure good seed quality, the purchase of seed cotton should be the main method, and the self-operated ginneries of the fine seed management areas of each province's Department of Agriculture and Forestry should be responsible for the purchase and processing, or cooperate with local cotton yarn companies and cooperatives, or organize private gins to purchase and process. The controlled fine seeds, in addition to being used for local expansion and promotion, can also be allocated and solved nearby in some disaster areas, newly expanded cotton areas, and areas with no seed retention habits. Now the new cotton has been put on the market, and all regions have made arrangements. Agricultural departments at all levels, especially cotton improvement departments, must vigorously carry out a series of tasks to do a good job in this year's cotton harvesting and planting, ensure the good quality and germination of this year's cotton seeds, and overcome the serious shortcomings of poor fine seeds and poor germination in many regions this spring.
　　1. Strengthen the organizational work of purchasing fine cotton: The purchase of fine seeds should rely on administrative organs at all levels (especially at the village level), combined with the seed selection movement. Through various meetings, the importance of maintaining fine seeds should be explained, and the cotton-grain price ratio, grade price difference, and the method of purchasing fine cotton at a premium in the fine seed management area should be publicized, so that the masses generally know that good cotton has a good price, so that they can automatically pay attention to seed selection, achieve separate harvesting, storage, and sale of good and bad cotton, and be willing to send seed cotton directly to fine seed purchasing institutions (for those fine seed management areas that are not concentrated, several more cotton collection stations can be set up to facilitate the masses to deliver cotton). Last year's experience of the North China Cotton Improvement Office proved that when purchasing fine seeds, it is much safer to have village cadres issue introduction letters to prove whether it is fine cotton or selected cotton, than for us to identify it by eyesight; Tongxian County inspected individual mixed cotton and non-fine cotton from other villages posing as fine cotton to sell, and gave criticism and explanation on the spot, and introduced them to the village government for education, which played a great role. Guo Tun, the village chief of Linqing, said: "As long as the price is right for the 2B cotton seeds in our village, I guarantee that most of them will be sold to the Cotton Improvement Office, and I also guarantee that there is no mixed cotton." The practice of simply picking and purchasing fine seeds from the market and simply relying on grading inspection to maintain quality must be overcome. At the same time, fine cotton purchasing institutions should be combined with relevant departments (trade, finance, cooperatives, etc.), in addition to ensuring the implementation of the cotton-grain price ratio, such as the collection of fine cotton, the repayment of seed cotton for grain loans, and fertilizer loans, should be sent to ginneries to prevent the loss of fine seeds. As for the people's self-retained seeds, the village government can organize manpower to gin the cotton in a concentrated manner within a certain period of time to maintain the purity of the seeds.
　　2. Strictly carry out grading inspection when collecting cotton to implement the policy of superior cotton with superior price, and do a good job in seed identification: Each cotton collection station can make samples of grade and length according to the grade of purchase, so that the masses have a deeper understanding of good cotton and good price, which is convenient for separate collection. After the seed cotton of each grade is collected, it should be stored separately, cleaned separately, ginned, cleaned, and screened. It should also be combined with the cotton yarn company to do the picking of flowers before ginning, and the picking of seeds after necessary screening, so that the seeds are more pure. The seeds of each grade are identified in batches according to the fine cotton seed identification methods promulgated by the central government, labeled, and then stored separately. The seeds returned by the masses must also be identified. If the cotton seeds loaned out this spring are not recovered well, they cannot be used for seeding.
　　3. Do a good job in storage and avoid mildew and rot: The seed cotton received by the ginnery should be dried before being stacked (in the south, where there is more rain, warehouses should be gradually built). The warehouse should be responsible by a special person, and should be checked and turned over frequently. For large piles of cotton, pay attention to ginning the bottom of the stack first, avoid only ginning the top of the stack and not ginning the bottom of the stack for a long time, which may cause mildew and rot. Cotton seed storage must pay attention to ventilation to make the cotton seeds dry. Areas with conditions (such as those where the masses are willing to plant fine cotton and ensure that they are not mixed and lost) are best to transport the fine seeds to the promotion areas as soon as possible according to the promotion plan, and distribute them to the masses for safekeeping, which can avoid the lack of warehouses and the difficulty of storing a large number of seeds.
　　4. In general cotton areas and disaster areas, new cotton areas lacking cotton seeds can organize households to households, villages to villages, districts to districts, or counties to counties to carry out allocation in a planned way, or purchase and supplement in neighboring cotton producing areas. This spring, various places have organized the allocation of cotton seeds in a small range and achieved remarkable results. This experience should be used and widely promoted relying on the strength of the masses and local grass-roots organizations; avoid the practice of large-scale long-distance allocation without thorough investigation to avoid losses.
　　5. Local fine seed purchasing institutions should record in detail the situation of the fine seed management area from the sowing to the harvest of cotton (including sowing, cultivation management, growth, unit yield, total yield, etc.) and the purchase quantity, price inspection, and the quality of each batch of seeds, so as to compare each year as a concrete result of checking the progress of cotton improvement and the decline or increase in quality, so that it becomes an important basis for replanting and improvement.

　　做好棉花的收种工作
    中央农业部工业原料司
    全国棉产工作会议上，决定今秋在全国各良种管理区范围内，收购与收回（今春贷出去的）良种棉籽一○二万担，估计明年良种面积可达一、九○○万亩。为保证种籽品质好，以收购籽棉为主，并由各省农林厅良种管理区之自营轧花厂负责收购、加工，或与当地花纱布公司、合作社合作，或组织私人轧车收购加工。控制的良种，除供就地扩大推广外，在部分灾区新扩大棉区及没有留种习惯的地区，亦可就近调剂解决。现在新花业已上市，各地均进行了布置，各级农业部门，尤其是棉产改进部门，必须大力进行一系列的工作，将今年的棉花收种工作做好，保证今年的棉花种子品质好，发芽好，克服今春许多地区良种不良，发芽不好的严重缺点。
    一、加强收购良棉的组织工作：良种的收购，要依靠各级行政机构（尤其是村级）结合选种运动，经过各种会议说明保持良种的重要，宣传棉粮比价，等级差价，与良种管理区良棉加价收购的办法，使群众普遍知道好棉花好价钱，以便其自动注意选种，作到好坏花分收，分存，分售，并愿意将籽棉直接送往良种收购机构（良管区不集中的可多设几个收花站，以便利群众交花）。去年华北棉产改进处经验证明，在收购良种时由村干部开介绍信，证明是否良棉或选种花，比我们凭眼力识别，要保险的多；通县检验出个别掺杂花的，及外村非良棉冒充良棉来卖，当场给以批评解释，并介绍到本村政府给以教育，起作用很大。临清郭屯村长说：“俺村的二Ｂ籽棉只要价钱合适，我保证大部分卖给棉产改进处，还保证没有掺杂花的。”要克服单从集市挑购良种及单纯依据分级检验保持品质的作法。同时良棉收购机构，应和各有关部门（贸易、财政、合作社等）结合，除保证棉粮比价之执行外，如良棉征收，贷粮，贷肥的收还籽棉，都应送往轧花厂不使良种散失。至于群众的自留种可由村政府组织人力轧花车，于一定时间内集中加工，以保持种籽的纯洁。
    二、收花时严格进行分级检验贯彻优棉优价政策，并做好种籽鉴定工作：各收花站可按着收购的等级，作出品级及长度的样品，使群众对好棉花好价钱的认识更深刻，便于分收。各等级的籽棉收进后要分别存放，分别清花，轧花，清籽，筛籽等，还应结合花纱布公司作到轧花前的拣花，及进行必要的筛籽后的拣籽工作，使种籽更加纯洁。各等级的种子都依据中央公布的良种棉籽鉴定办法，进行分批鉴定，标上标签，再分别入库，群众交还的种籽亦须经过鉴定。今春贷出的棉籽，如收回的不好，则不可作种用。
    三、做好保管储藏工作，避免发霉发烂：轧花厂所收籽棉要经过晒花后，再堆垛（南方因雨多，应逐渐建立仓库）。仓库要有专人负责，经常检查，经常翻晒，大堆棉花，须注意先轧垛底，避免只轧垛顶，长期不轧垛底，而有霉烂的现象发生。棉籽储藏须注意通风，以使棉籽干燥，有条件地区（如群众已乐意种良棉保证不混杂散失者）最好根据推广计划将良籽及早运往各推广地区，发给群众保管，可避免仓库缺乏，大量种籽不容易储藏的困难。
    四、一般棉区及灾区、新棉区缺乏棉种者可有计划地组织户与户，村与村，区与区，或县与县进行调剂，或在邻区产棉地收购补充。今春各地在小范围内组织调剂棉籽，收到显著成绩，应该运用这一经验，依靠群众力量及各地基层组织，广泛推行；切忌不经过切实调查，大量远程调剂的作法，以避免遭受损失。
    五、各地良种收购机构，应将良管区从棉花的播种到收获的情况（包括播种耕作管理生育情况单位产量总产量等）及收购数量、价格检定、各批种籽的品质，进行详细记载，以备每年比较，作为检查棉产改进之进度及品质上降低与提高的具体结果，使之成为换种与改进之重要依据。
