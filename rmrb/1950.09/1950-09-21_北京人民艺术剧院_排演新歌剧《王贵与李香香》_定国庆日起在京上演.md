　　Stages New Opera "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang"
　　To Premiere in Beijing on National Day
    To celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the Central People's Government, the Beijing People's Art Theatre is actively rehearsing the four-act, eight-scene revolutionary romance opera "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang." The play is adapted by Yu Cun from Li Ji's original poem and directed by Liu Yumin and Ouyang Shanzun. The content describes the early revolutionary history of northern Shaanxi. The story takes place in a small village called Siyangwan in Sanbian. The male and female protagonists, Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang, were born into poor peasant families and suffered exploitation and humiliation by landlords from an early age. Their thoughts are filled with fiery resistance. Together with the people of the village and the guerrillas, they wage a hard struggle against the landlord Cui Er'ye under the leadership of the Communist Party. In the struggle, they demonstrated a noble revolutionary spirit and finally achieved victory. After liberating their hometown of Siyangwan and capturing the landlord, lackeys, and White bandit soldiers, a revolutionary wedding is held on the spot, presided over by Xiangxiang's father, the guerrilla captain, and the masses. The director used comedic techniques to handle this new opera. The composer Liang Hanguang used the characteristics and melodies of northern Shaanxi folk songs, with the full orchestra participating in the accompaniment. There is very little dialogue in the entire play, which is completely interwoven with singing and music. After two months of rehearsals, the play is now scheduled to premiere at the Beijing Theater (Zhenguang) in Beijing on National Day. (Beijing People's Art Theatre Communication Group)
