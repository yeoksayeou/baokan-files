[Report from our correspondent Qi Ming:] National state-owned electric power production has achieved significant accomplishments in the first half of this year. The equipment utilization rate has increased from 23.5% last year to 27.8% this year. This is a significant improvement in electric power production. Regarding the potential output of state-owned power plants in the Northeast, North China, and East China regions (i.e., the amount of electricity that can be generated based on the current condition of the equipment), through strengthening overhaul work and establishing overhaul systems, it has increased from 65% last year to 78.8% this year. Some power plants in North China have reached 100%; power plants such as Shijingshan and Fengshan have even reached their nameplate output (i.e., the amount of electricity specified when the machine was manufactured). This has overcome the enormous waste caused by irrational equipment utilization and shattered the conservative thinking of some old technicians who were content with the old production levels.

Significant results have also been achieved in reducing costs. Comparing January to May with the same period last year, coal consumption decreased by 14.7%; plant electricity consumption decreased by 15.5%; line loss decreased by 48.4%; a total of 53.4 million jin of millet was saved in coal and electricity costs.

Accidents have also relatively decreased compared to the same period last year. In the first half of this year, a total of 3,295 accidents occurred in Northeast and North China, a decrease of 34% compared to the same period last year. The Xiaofengman power plant in Northeast China and the Fengshan power plant in North China have created new records of no accidents for six months. However, responsibility accidents and casualties are still quite serious. Statistics from the Northeast and North China regions show 61 casualty accidents, with 26 deaths and 37 injuries. This is due to the irresponsibility of some personnel, their lack of willingness to learn technical operating procedures, and their political numbness and negligence in prevention, which has resulted in serious waste in production and affected the production of other industries.

Capital construction is the weakest link in electric power work. In the past six months, only 27.7% of the annual plan has been completed. This is due to the lack of thorough investigation and research beforehand, plans that are not practical, untimely supply of materials in the process of implementing the plan, and a lack of strong organizational leadership and strict inspection. In addition, issues concerning the adjustment of electricity prices and the leadership and management of public and private power plants in various regions need to be further resolved.

　　半年来全国国营电厂成就大
    设备利用率提高成本降低
    贯彻专责制保证安全送电仍待大力加强
    【本报讯】特约通讯员齐明报道：全国国营电业生产今年上半年获得重大成就。设备利用率由去年的百分之二十三点五提高到今年的百分之二十七点八。这是电业生产上具有重大意义的改进。就东北、华北、华东三区国营电厂的设备可能出力（即按照设备的现况，可能达到的发电量）来说，经过加强检修工作，建立检修制度，已由去年的百分之六十五提高到今年的百分之七十八点八，华北某些电厂已达百分之百；石景山、凤山等电厂且已达到铭牌出力（即制造机器时，所规定的发电量）。克服了因设备利用得不合理而造成的巨大浪费，并打破了若干旧技术人员满足于旧生产水平的保守思想。
    在减低成本方面，亦收到显著的成效。以一至五月份与去年同期比较，煤耗减低百分之十四点七；厂用电减少百分之十五点五；线路损失减少百分之四十八点四；煤电两项共计节省小米五千三百四十万斤。
    事故方面较去年同期也相对减少了。今年上半年东北、华北共发生事故三千二百九十五次，较去年同期减少百分之三十四。东北小丰满和华北的凤山电厂则创造了半年无事故的新纪录。但责任事故与伤亡事故还是相当严重的，东北、华北两区统计伤亡事故六十一次，死二十六人，伤三十七人。这是由于某些人员工作不负责，不虚心学习技术操作规程，以及政治上麻痹，疏于防范所致，因而造成生产中的严重浪费，影响到其他工业的生产。
    基本建设工程是电业工作中最弱的一环，半年来仅完成年度计划的百分之二十七点七。这是由于事前缺乏严密的调查研究，计划不切合实际，以及在执行计划过程中器材供应不及时，缺乏坚强的组织领导和严密的检查的缘故。此外，关于调整电价及对各地公私营电厂的领导与管理问题，均有待进一步解决。
