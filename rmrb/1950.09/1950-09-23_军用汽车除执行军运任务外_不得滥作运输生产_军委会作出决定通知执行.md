　　Military Vehicles, Except When Performing Military Transport Tasks,
    Must Not Be Used Indiscriminately for Transport and Production
    The Military Commission Has Made a Decision and Issued a Notice for Implementation
    [This Newspaper Reports] The People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, in order to safeguard the normal transportation of legitimate public and private vehicles, has made a regulation stipulating that military vehicles should not be used for transportation and production and has issued a notice for implementation. The regulation states: "1. All military vehicles, except when performing military transportation tasks, should not participate in other various non-military transportation. If government transportation and trade departments require military vehicles for non-military transportation due to some urgent need, it must be approved by the head of the logistics department of each level of military region, and the government transportation and trade department should discuss specific implementation methods with the logistics department of the first-level military region before it is permitted to carry. 2. All military vehicles are not allowed to privately solicit passengers and goods for production purposes when returning empty after military transportation. Such return trips must also have detailed transport methods discussed in advance between the logistics department of each level of military region and the local government's transportation and highway transportation departments, and detailed implementation rules must be formulated and implemented in order to have something to follow, overcome the chaotic phenomenon of military vehicles being used indiscriminately for production, and maintain the normal transportation of legitimate public and private vehicles."

    不得滥作运输生产
    军委会作出决定通知执行
    【本报讯】中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会为了维护正当公私汽车的正常运输，特作出军用汽车不作运输生产的规定，通知执行。该规定称：“一、所有军用汽车，除执行军事运输任务外，不应参加其他各种非军事运输。若政府交通贸易部门为了某种迫切需要，要求军用汽车作非军事运输时，须一律经过各一级军区后勤部首长之批准，并由政府交通贸易部门与一级军区后勤部商议具体执行办法后，才许承运。二、所有军用汽车因军事运输当回程空放时，概不准私行兜揽客货自作生产。此种回程时之捎运也必须有各一级军区后勤部与当地政府之交通公路运输部门事先商议详细捎运办法，订制施行细则以便有所遵循，克服军车滥作生产之混乱现象，而维正当公私汽车之正常运输。”
