Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, Sofia Dispatch from TASS on the 8th: The Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly, on the occasion of celebrating the sixth anniversary of the liberation of Bulgaria on September 9th, awarded gold, silver, and bronze labor medals to 463 laborers, respectively, in recognition of their special contributions to the country and their outstanding achievements in implementing the grain requisition plan.

In view of the increasing consolidation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the tremendous achievements in construction over the past six years, the Presidium of the National Assembly has promulgated an amnesty decree, pardoning 1,257 criminals and reducing the sentences of 1,891 people.

Xinhua News Agency, September 4th, Sofia Dispatch from TASS: The Bulgarian News Agency announced that the Sofia District Court publicly tried a group of criminals who had participated in the traitorous organization of Kostov, the enemy of the Bulgarian people, from August 21st to 26th. Among the defendants were Petrovsky, the former Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of Bulgaria, Simov, the former Deputy Minister of Industry and Handicraft Production, and twelve others. The trial confirmed that Petrovsky and others acted as British spies and followed Kostov's orders, using their positions to sabotage the country's economic construction projects, deliberately create panic in the people's food supply, disrupt foreign trade, and sell confidential information about the national economy to foreign countries. Petrovsky deliberately approved a transaction that was beneficial to Western countries, causing Bulgaria to lose 69 million leva. Simov's sabotage activities in expanding and building industrial enterprises caused the country to lose 144.66 million leva.

During the six-day public trial, all the defendants confessed their crimes. On the 26th, the court pronounced its verdict, sentencing Petrovsky and Kelyakov to life imprisonment and Simov and others to strict imprisonment for terms ranging from eight to fifteen years.
