Sanlian Bookstore's Review and Correction of the Contents of the Book "India"

　　In the "New China Encyclopedia Small Series" published by our bookstore, there is a book called "India" by the author Mai Lang, which was first published in Shanghai in June 1949.

　　Section 6 of this book (pages 26-30) discusses the issue of Indian-Muslim conflict in India. The author's main intention was to explain the historical factors of the Indian-Muslim conflict and how British imperialism used this gap to carry out its division plot in order to smoothly establish its colonial rule. However, in the title and in the text, a big mistake was made, incorrect materials were cited, and the history of Islam was distorted. We did not correct it during the review process, which was a serious error.

　　When we discovered this problem, we had already stopped selling the book. Now we have corrected and deleted the erroneous parts, re-typeset them, and continued to sell the book. The words "Corrected Edition" are printed on the cover for identification.

　　For the books that have already been sold before the sales were stopped, in order to help readers understand the errors in the book and avoid spreading false information, we hope that readers who have purchased this book will go to the local Sanlian Bookstore to request or write for the reprinted part of the book for self-replacement.

　　三联书店关于《印度》一书内容的检讨与更正
    在我店出版的《新中国百科小丛书》中，有一本《印度》，著者麦浪，系一九四九年六月在上海初版。
    这本书的第六节（二六页——三○页），谈的是印度的印回冲突问题，著者的主要企图是要说明印回冲突的历史因素，以及英帝国主义怎样利用这个间隙，遂行它的分裂阴谋，以便顺利建立它的殖民地统治。但在标题和文字中间，却犯了很大的错误，引用了不正确的材料，对回教的历史作了歪曲的叙述。我们在审读中没有加以改正，是一个严重的错误。
    我们发觉这个问题的时候，已经把这本书停止发售了。现在把其中错误的地方加以改正和删除，重行排印，继续发售。并在封面上加印“校正本”三字，以资辨别。
    对于在停售前已经售出去的书，为了使读者了解书中的错误，免得以讹传讹起见，我们希望曾买到这本书的读者，到各地三联书店面索或函索该书重印部分，以便自行拆换。
