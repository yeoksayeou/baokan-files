On the Epidemic Situation and Prevention of Epidemic Encephalitis in China
    Li Kewen
    Encephalitis in China intensified and spread to all provinces and cities after the Japanese imperialists launched their war of aggression. The Kuomintang reactionary government never paid attention to it, so there are no systematic statistics. After the liberation of various parts of the country, in August and September 1949, Beijing was plagued by this disease. According to hospital records, there were more than 190 patients. In order to prevent the occurrence of encephalitis, this year the People's Government dredged the seas and rivers in Beijing. After the establishment of the Central Ministry of Health, the Central Institute of Hygiene and Experimental Medicine analyzed the virus and studied the transmission methods of the disease. The Central Institute of Biological Products has trial-produced epidemic encephalitis vaccine, which is now available and has good results, but the quantity is small.
    On May 4 this year, a symposium on the prevention and treatment of epidemic encephalitis was held in Beijing, including the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau and experts, to introduce the successful experience of Dalian in preventing and treating the disease. After the meeting, the Central Ministry of Health, based on the opinions of all parties, specifically instructed the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau to deploy prevention and control work. The Beijing Municipal Health Committee was established in Beijing to begin summer prevention of cholera and epidemic encephalitis. At the end of June, the Epidemic Prevention Department of the Central Ministry of Health further urged the Beijing Municipal Health Committee to make a detailed work plan and subsidized manpower, funds, and equipment, and dredged 55 catties of mosquito larvae. The work has not stopped. However, due to the lack of in-depth publicity and mobilization of the masses, the occurrence of the disease could not be effectively curbed.
    From May to July this year, a total of 10 suspected cases of epidemic encephalitis were discovered in Beijing. As of the statistics on the 6th of this month, there were a total of 306 patients and suspected patients in Beijing, with 102 deaths, and a mortality rate of about 33%. Most of the patients are working people and outsiders aged 2 to 15. At the same time, it has also occurred in various parts of the country. According to reports from Tianjin, from August 2 to 22, 105 patients with epidemic encephalitis were found, and 27 died. In Baoding and Changli, Hebei, 26 patients were found and 9 died. Nanjing reported 15 cases. In order to prevent and control the disease more effectively, the Central Ministry of Health convened an emergency prevention and control meeting on August 29. More than 30 experts from the Beijing Municipal Committee, the Municipal Health Committee, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Women's Federation, the Municipal Public Health Bureau, the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau, and Peking Union Medical College and Peking University Medical College attended the meeting. All units reported the situation at the meeting, experts reported the research results, and further strengthened the prevention and control work in Beijing. After the meeting, specific methods of prevention were instructed to the five provinces and two cities in North China and areas with the disease such as Nanjing and Chengdu. Although this disease does not spread as quickly as plague and smallpox, it has a high mortality rate and there is no specific treatment method. However, there are specific methods for prevention, so the Central Ministry of Health has listed the prevention of epidemic encephalitis as one of the key points of prevention and control.
    Expert experiments have proved that epidemic encephalitis is spread by black and white spotted mosquitoes. This kind of mosquito bites people during the day and breeds in tree holes and household water containers. Whether other mosquitoes can spread the disease is still under study. Therefore, the focus of preventing the occurrence of epidemic encephalitis should be on mosquito eradication. For example, Dalian City was plagued by this disease in 1948. In 1949, a mosquito eradication team was organized to carry out preventive publicity and education, combined with grass-roots health organizations to check the sanitary conditions of each household, reward the good, and criticize or punish the bad. And in conjunction with the masses, especially women and children, two and a half tons of mosquito larvae were removed. After mobilizing the masses to carry out mosquito eradication work, there were no mosquitoes. In 1948, more than a thousand people died of epidemic encephalitis in the city, but no patients occurred last year. At the same time, 27 soldiers stationed in Beijing suffered from this disease in August last year. This year, the environmental sanitation has been improved, and as of now, there are only nine cases.
    Mosquito eradication work, first of all, is to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. In other words, it is to prevent the breeding of mosquito larvae.
    (1) Do not allow pots, cans, waste barrels, flower pots, etc. in the home to store water. Clean them frequently, and turn them over and buckle them up when not in use, so that mosquitoes cannot lay eggs and breed.
    (2) The low-lying water pits or stagnant water in waterways in the home should be drained after each rain.
    (3) The vats and jars of soy sauce shops and porcelain shops should be placed upside down to avoid water storage.
    (4) The Taiping water tank should be changed every five or six days, or tightly covered, and check frequently for the production of mosquito larvae.
    (5) Check whether there are tree holes in the trees in the courtyard and street trees. If there are tree holes, apply mud to them.
    (6) Mobilize the masses to use gauze to make nets in their spare time to remove the larvae in the ponds and ditches, which will be collected by the government, and those who have achieved results in catching the larvae will be rewarded.
    In terms of capturing and killing adult mosquitoes, for the gathering places of adult mosquitoes, such as tree holes, dark places, and houses near the patient's home, DDT solution can be sprayed with emphasis to kill adult mosquitoes. When spraying, spray on the walls, doors, windows, and ceilings. There is no need to spray on the ground and in the air to reduce unnecessary waste. In terms of preventing mosquito bites, it is advisable to promote the use of artemisia ropes and mosquito coils, and it is better to have mosquito nets.
    The above preventive methods cost very little and are acceptable to the masses. This is a mass work, so it must rely on the masses to complete the task, which cannot be solely undertaken by a few epidemic prevention personnel. In mobilizing the masses, publicity and education should be carried out first to make the masses understand the severity of the disease, the source of the disease, and the situation of mosquitoes spreading the disease. It is necessary to carry out publicity to every household to make the masses automatically start preventive work. At the same time, administrative organs and epidemic prevention personnel must conduct in-depth inspections to effectively ensure that each household can do the above-mentioned mosquito prevention and eradication work. In this way, mosquitoes will be greatly reduced, and epidemic encephalitis will not easily occur.
    At present, Beijing health personnel, in conjunction with public security police stations, are summoning health team leaders in sections, and epidemic prevention personnel are conducting publicity and organization work, carrying out a universal mosquito prevention and eradication campaign, and strengthening epidemic reporting, free isolation and treatment of patients. If this work is done thoroughly, the epidemic encephalitis in Beijing will be quickly curbed. If this work can be launched earlier next year, there will not be as many cases as this year, and the disease may not even occur again.
    It is hoped that areas with epidemic encephalitis such as Tianjin, Nanjing, Baoding, and Chengdu will refer to the methods of Dalian and Beijing, and according to the specific conditions of the area, try to eliminate it as soon as possible.

　　关于流行性脑炎在我国流行的情况及预防问题
    李克温
    脑炎在中国流行，在日寇发动侵略战争后，才渐渐加剧，并蔓延到全国各省市，国民党反动政府从未加以重视，所以没有系统的统计材料。全国各地解放后，一九四九年八、九月间，北京市曾流行此病，就各医院的记载，患者共一百九十余人。为了制止脑炎的发生，今年人民政府疏浚了北京市的海及河。中央卫生部成立后，即曾由中央卫生实验院分析了病毒，并研究了此病的传播方式，由中央生物制品研究所试制流行性脑炎疫苗，现已有出品，效果还好，只是数量不多。
    今年五月四日，在北京召开了一个包括北京市公共卫生局及专家们的防治流行性脑炎座谈会，介绍了大连防治这个病的成功经验。会后中央卫生部根据各方面的意见，具体的指示了北京市公共卫生局布置防治工作，在京市成立了北京市卫生委员会，开始进行夏令预防霍乱及流行性脑炎的工作。六月底中央卫生部防疫处更进一步督促京市卫生委员会作出详细工作计划，并补助人力及经费器材，曾捞了五十五斤孑孓，工作至今未断。惟因没有深入宣传及发动群众，以致未能有效的制止此病的发生。
    今年五至七月间北京市共发现了疑似流行性脑炎患者十人，至本月六日的统计，北京市患者及疑似患者共三百零六人，死亡一百零二人，死亡率约占百分之三十三。患者多为二至十五岁的劳动人民及外来的人。同时全国各地亦均有发生。据天津市报告，由八月二日至二十二日止，发现流行性脑炎患者一百零五人，死亡二十七人。河北保定及昌黎发现患者二十六人，死亡九人。南京市报告有十五例。为了更有效的防治此病，中央卫生部于八月二十九日召开了一个紧急防治会议，到有北京市委会、市卫生委员会、市文教局、市公安局、市妇联、市公共卫生局、市卫生工程局及协和医学院、北大医学院各专家三十余人。各单位在会上反映了情况，专家们报告了研究结果，并进一步加强了北京市的防治工作。会后即对华北五省二市及南京成都等有此疾病发生的地区具体指示预防方法。此病虽不如鼠疫、天花等病传播的快，但死亡率高，治疗还没有特效办法。但在预防上却有了具体的办法，所以中央卫生部把流行性脑炎的预防列为防治的重点之一。
    专家的实验证明了：流行性脑炎是黑白斑的蚊子所传播的。这种蚊子在白日咬人，滋生于树穴内及家庭积水器皿中。至于其他的蚊子能否传播此病，尚在研究中。所以预防流行性脑炎的发生，重点应放在灭蚊工作上。例如大连市在一九四八年曾流行此病，一九四九年组织灭蚊队，进行预防宣传教育，结合基层卫生组织挨户检查卫生情况，奖励好的，批评或处罚坏的。并结合群众，特别是妇女儿童，捞除孑孓共二吨半。发动群众来进行灭蚊工作后，蚊子就没有了。一九四八年该市曾有流行性脑炎，死者千余人，但去年就没有发生过一个患者。同时驻京部队去年八月间患此病者二十七名，今年改善了环境卫生，截至现在为止，患者仅有九例。
    灭蚊工作，首先是防止蚊虫的滋生。换句话说，就是防止蚊幼虫孑孓的滋生。
    （一）家庭中的盆、罐、废筒、花盆等，不要让它们存有积水，经常清除，不用时翻转倒扣起来，使蚊子不能产卵、滋生。
    （二）家庭中低洼积水坑或水道滞水的地方，在每次下雨后，应设法将积水排去。
    （三）酱油店及瓷货店的缸罐，应倒扣放置，避免存水。
    （四）太平水缸应五六天换水一次，或严密盖起，时常检查有无孑孓产生。
    （五）检查庭院树木和街树有无树穴，如有树穴，则用泥抹上。
    （六）发动群众在空闲时间用纱布作成网子，捞除池塘水沟内的孑孓，由政府收集，并对捞孑孓有成绩者加以奖励。
    在捕灭成蚊方面，对于成蚊的聚集地点，如树洞、阴暗处，病家的附近房屋，可以有重点的喷射ＤＤＴ溶液，杀灭成蚊。喷的时候应喷在墙壁上、门窗上及天花板上，地下及空气中不需要喷，以减少不必要的浪费。在防止蚊虫叮咬方面，可提倡点艾绳，点蚊香，能够备蚊帐更好。
    以上这些预防方法，花费很少，也是群众能够接受的。这是一个群众性的工作，所以必须依靠群众才能完成任务，绝非少数防疫人员能够单独胜任的。在发动群众方面，应先进行宣传教育，使群众明了病的厉害，得病的根源，蚊虫传播此病的情形。要深入每个家庭进行宣传，使群众自动的动起进行预防工作。同时行政机关及防疫人员必须进行深入的检查工作，切实保证每户能作好上述的防蚊、灭蚊工作。这样蚊虫才会大大的减少，流行性脑炎才不易发生。
    目前北京市卫生人员结合公安派出所，分段召集卫生小组长，由防疫人员进行宣传和组织工作，开展普遍性的防蚊灭蚊运动，并加强了疫情报告，免费隔离收治患者，如这一工作作得彻底，则北京市的流行性脑炎，必会迅速遏止。明年如能更早发动这一工作，则不会再有今年这样多的病例，甚至不会再发生此病。
    希望天津、南京、保定、成都等有流行性脑炎发生的地区参照大连、北京的办法，根据当地具体情况，尽速设法扑灭。
