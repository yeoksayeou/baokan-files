　　Maritime Hero Pu Enzhao
    This is a hero's story, a miracle created by our maritime hero.
    Shi Guanjun
    On the evening of March 31st this year, the sea fog was very heavy, enveloping the Qiongzhou Strait; after dark, the heavy fog turned into light rain, and a slight wind rose on the sea, coincidentally blowing the wind we needed—an easterly wind. This delighted the soldiers, and the sailors on the warships looked up at the wind vane fluttering on the mast, shouting repeatedly, "Good wind! Good wind!" Nearly a hundred large and small sailboats, under unified command, took advantage of the wind and set sail, departing from Boqi Port on the Leizhou Peninsula and heading straight for Hainan Island. The escort mission for this entire fleet was undertaken by several light wooden boats. The No. 5 boat of the Sixth Company of the 381st Regiment was one of them.

    Inside this single-masted small boat, in addition to three civilian boatmen, there was a squad of infantry, plus a machine gun and a 60mm mortar. Deputy Instructor He Shaofu served as the captain of this boat. This task of dealing with enemy warships at sea and covering the main force's passage was not easy to accomplish. The infantry squad on this boat—the Third Squad—was a combat model squad famous for its exploits in the Northeast. Sailor Pu Enzhao, of the Third Squad, was the most outstanding "boat leader" trained in maritime exercises.

    Crossing layers of waves, the small boat closely followed the large fleet of warships. Drizzle sprinkled on the comrades' faces. The captain, in charge of the direction, kept a close eye on the navigation lights ahead. The soldiers, already soaked by the rain, discussed in groups how to carry out the tasks assigned to them. Pu Enzhao made a guarantee to the entire boat: "If we discover enemy warships, we will resolutely stand at our posts, steer the boat well, and no matter how critical the situation, we will guarantee to ram it!"

    After crossing the murky waters near the shore and entering the main current, the wind stopped. The small boat moved slowly forward on the windless sea, gradually changing direction due to the current. This was truly infuriating; only one-third of the sixty-mile sea voyage had been completed.

    At this time, rowing (using human power to replace wind power) became the top priority. Sailor Pu Enzhao was the first to pick up the oar, encouraging everyone, saying: "Fighting on land relies on legs, fighting at sea relies on boats. To advance is to win. Comrades, row!" This powerful mobilization immediately received a response from the entire boat. Six oars went into the water together, and the small boat, as if it had grown six legs, resisted the tide and broke the waves, quickly correcting its course and advancing.

    At 11 p.m., intense gunfire was heard from the right front.

    "Has the assault force landed?" While the comrades on the boat were speculating, the sound of motors, coming from far away, solved the mystery. —Enemy warships were coming, and the escort ships in front had already engaged in fire.

    After determining the situation, Captain He Shaofu called on the entire boat to intensify preparations according to their respective tasks, resolutely entangle with the enemy warships, and cover the main fleet's passage! This slogan replaced the order. Everyone on the boat took their positions, gripped their weapons tightly, prepared to fight the enemy warships. He Shaofu checked the preparations of each group, clearly explained the tasks, listened for the order to fire, and then turned back to instruct Pu Enzhao to steer the boat well no matter what.

    Shells falling on the sea surface stirred up tall water columns. The boatmen were frightened by the fierce naval battle and scrambled into the bottom of the cabin. Pu Enzhao embraced the helm and pulled it into his arms, and the small boat headed straight for the direction of the fierce battle. Standing on the high platform at the stern, he called out to the comrades, "Everyone, prepare with peace of mind. With me at the helm, I guarantee we'll make it!"

    What was originally only a vaguely visible black mass like a small mountain in the distance was now clearly visible. Three enemy warships, one large and two small, were lined up in the right front, fighting against our brother units' escort fleet. Pu Enzhao steered the boat, and the small boat lunged at the enemy warship.

    The large warship discovered this small wooden boat bravely approaching it and opened fire to stop its advance. Shells stirred up huge waves around the small boat, and water splashed onto the deck from the side of the boat. The flames of the explosion illuminated the entire boat. Pu Enzhao stood tall on the steering platform, his eyes staring straight ahead, gripping the helm tightly, and the small boat continued to advance towards the enemy's large warship.

    When the distance between the enemy and us was shortened to more than a hundred meters, the captain gave the order to fire. Pu Enzhao shouted loudly: "Comrades! The opportunity to perform meritorious service and become heroes has arrived! Let's do it!" Immediately, the already prepared 60mm mortars, machine guns, and rifles were all fired at the enemy warship. The enemy's large warship also concentrated all its firepower on dealing with this small boat that posed a great threat to it. The sound of gunfire drowned out everything, and enemy shells exploded from time to time above the boat. In the firelight, everyone invariably looked back at the helmsman, who controlled the fate of the entire boat, the person they were most concerned about. Each time, Pu Enzhao's firm face gave everyone encouragement. He was always so calm, holding the helm tightly. The small boat never changed direction, but bounced forward in the huge waves churned up by the shells.

    The situation suddenly became urgent. In the fierce battle, the enemy warship hit the small boat's bow with the first shell, breaking the awning pole. The awning "swished" down, and the small boat was pressed to one side. Pu Enzhao jumped down from the stern to sort out the awning rope. At this moment, the small boat was hit by another shell, breaking the mast. More than half of the mast smashed down, completely pressing on the bow of the boat. The small boat was then submerged in the water. Another shell hit the bow, blowing a large hole the size of a basin. Seawater gushed out like a fountain, immediately filling the cabin, and the entire boat body was about to be swallowed by the sea. Pu Enzhao grabbed a backpack and blocked the hole with it, but because the hole was too large, the backpack immediately leaked into the sea. The brave Pu Enzhao moved back and forth on the deck. Several holes had been pierced in his upper garment by shrapnel. While encouraging everyone to continue fighting, he collected four backpacks and three ration bags, gathered them together, and barely managed to block the large hole the size of a basin, but it was soon pushed up again by the seawater. Pu Enzhao turned around and saw the body of a sacrificed comrade, so he moved it over with tears in his eyes and pressed it on top, finally patching up the boat. Then, under the close shooting of the enemy, he wielded a large machete, cut off the awning rope that was in a mess, pushed the awning and mast into the sea together, and the small boat regained its balance and continued to rush towards the enemy warship. There were only sixty or seventy meters left to the enemy. Pu Enzhao grabbed a submachine gun and fired a burst, but it didn't solve the problem, so he picked up a light machine gun and aimed it at the enemy warship. The small boat was hit by three more shells in succession, hitting the middle cabin and destroying the 60mm mortar that was firing. Pu Enzhao hurriedly ran over, grabbed the broken gun legs with both hands, and told the gunner to continue firing, hitting the enemy warship three times in a row. The cries of the enemy soldiers were carried over by the wind.

    The small boat was hit by two more shells, hitting vital spots, shattering the rudder, and drifting uncontrollably. The enemy warship never dared to let it go, and fired at it for two hours. The No. 5 boat entangled with the enemy warship for five hours. The enemy warship was unable to advance a step, and our main fleet successfully passed through the strait and landed on the south bank.

    In the end, the small boat only had a bare oar without a handle, no awning, no rudder, drifting on the boundless sea, the leaking cabin had long been filled with seawater. Pu Enzhao used a bare oar to paddle and continue sailing. He was still full of confidence in preparing to land the boat alone, but the tide reversed and drifted them back to the north shore. After a day and a night, on the evening of April 1st, they were rescued ashore by a fishing boat.

    In order to reward them for their achievement in fighting the warships, the division headquarters named the No. 5 boat the "Hero Boat." Pu Enzhao made three great achievements and won the glorious title of "Maritime Hero."

    Heroes are not made overnight. Pu Enzhao's first battle for the people was in the Liaoxi Campaign. With the cooperation of another comrade-in-arms, he bravely broke into the enemy's formation. The two of them defeated an enemy battalion, captured more than 300 enemies, and won his first meritorious service.

    The last battle on the mainland, the pursuit and annihilation battle on the Guangdong-Guangxi border, the opponent was the extremely stubborn Gui clique Bai bandit Seventh Army. On our army's pursuit route, the enemy held a hilltop controlling the highway, covering its main force's retreat. Pu Enzhao skillfully used the terrain, avoided enemy firepower, and took advantage of the gap when the enemy machine gun changed its ammunition belt to rush to the top of the mountain, kicked open the enemy machine gun with one foot, and subdued an enemy company with a burst of submachine gun fire, capturing more than 30 enemy soldiers alive, thus making a meritorious service.

    Our hero Pu Enzhao can withstand the test of battle and also withstand the grind of hardship. During the advance to liberate Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, it was the height of the southern summer. The troops braved the hot weather to cross the Jiuling Mountains. In a situation where there were more sick people than healthy ones, Pu Enzhao carried all the belongings of the sick people in the entire squad on his back, carried three rifles during the march, and fetched water and cooked food at the camp site, working diligently and conscientiously. When the platoon leader was seriously ill and unable to walk, Pu Enzhao and several other comrades carried him on a stretcher during the march. When the entire territory of Jiangxi was liberated, Pu Enzhao made another contribution.

    When advancing towards Guangdong, Pu Enzhao maintained his past glory, exposed the wavering thoughts of individual newly liberated soldiers, and persuaded them, consolidating the troops. As soon as the Guangdong-Guangxi border campaign began, Pu Enzhao's foot was injured, and the wound was not sealed, but he persisted in the three-thousand-mile pursuit operation. In two months of maritime training, Pu Enzhao was selected as a sailor and learned all the techniques of sailing, steering, rowing, paddling, poling, and anchoring.

    Pu Enzhao makes meritorious service in every battle and acts as a model everywhere. Since joining the army, he has made six great achievements. Why has Pu Enzhao become such an outstanding meritorious hero? Like the tens of millions of heroes in the People's Liberation Army, it is because he has a high degree of political consciousness. In Pu Enzhao's own words: "I am a person who has suffered. After joining my own team, I never forget that I am fighting for the millions of people who suffer like me. I used to be a 'Central Army' of the Kuomintang. No matter what, I used to use a gun to fight my own people. I want to make meritorious service to atone for my sins. In addition, I am now a member of the Chinese Communist Party. For the people and for the motherland, I am not afraid to sacrifice myself!"

　　海上英雄蒲恩昭
    这是一个英雄的故事，是我们海上英雄所创造的奇迹。
    石冠军
    今年三月三十一日的晚晌，海雾很大，笼罩了琼州海峡；天一黑大雾变成小雨，海面上微微的起了风，凑巧刮的是我们需要的风——东风。这可把战士们乐透了，战船上的水手们仰望着船桅杆上飘动的风信旗，连声喊着：“好风！好风！”   近百只的大小帆船，在统一号令下，乘风起渡，自雷州半岛的博?港出发，直向海南岛奔去。这整个船队的护航任务，是由几只轻便的小木船担任的。三八一团六连的五号船，就是其中的一个。
    在这只单桅的小船内，除了三个老百姓船工外，载着一个步兵班，附一挺机关枪，加一门六○炮。副指导员何少甫当了这个船上的船长。这个在海上对付敌人兵舰，掩护主力通过的任务，不是容易完成的。在这个船上的步兵班——第三班，是在东北打出名的战斗模范班。三班的水手蒲恩昭，是在海上练兵中训练出来的最出色的“船老大”。
    跨过层层海浪，小船紧紧贴着大队战船前进。牛毛雨洒在同志们的脸上。掌握方向的船长，时刻盯着前面的领航灯。已经被雨淋透了的战士们，分组讨论如何执行分担在自己身上的任务。蒲恩昭向全船提出保证：“发现敌人兵舰，坚决站在自己的岗位上，掌好舵，情况再危急，也保证开上去！”
    渡过近海的混水，进入主流，这时风却止住了。小船在无风的海面上，缓缓的前进，被潮流打的渐渐变换了方向，这可真急死人，六十里的海程，才走出来三分之一。
    这时候，划船（用人力代替风力），成了头等紧要的任务，水手蒲恩昭第一个操起橹把，鼓动大家说：“陆地上打仗靠腿，海上作战靠船，前进就是胜利，同志们：摇橹啊！”这有力的动员，立刻得到全船的响应，六把橹一齐下水，小船像生了六条腿一样，抗潮压浪，飞快的改正了方向前进。
    夜十一点，右前方传来激烈的枪炮声。
    “是突击部队登陆了吗？”船上的同志们正在猜想着，由远而近的马达声，解开了这个谜。——敌人的兵舰来了，前面的护航船，已经接上了火。
    船长何少甫，在判明情况之后，号召全船按各人的分工，加紧准备，坚决和敌舰纠缠，掩护主力船队通过！这口号代替了命令，船上的人各就各位，握紧手中的武器，准备和敌舰厮杀。何少甫检查了各组的准备，把任务交待清楚，听口令开火，就回头嘱咐蒲恩昭，无论如何要把船开好。
    落在海面上的炮弹，激起高大的水柱。船工被这激烈的海战吓慌了手脚，纷纷钻进船舱底。蒲恩昭抱起舵把往怀里一带，小船直奔激战的方向开去。他站在船尾的高台上，招呼同志们说：“大伙放心准备吧，有我掌舵，保险开得上去！”
    原来还只是在远处隐隐约约看见的像小山似的一片黑东西，现在已经看得清楚了。三只敌舰，一大两小，排列在右前方，和我军兄弟连队的护航队对打。蒲恩昭一摆舵，小船就向着敌舰扑上去。
    大兵舰发现了这只勇猛向它逼近的小木船，就开炮阻止它的前进。炮弹在小船的周围掀起巨浪，水花从船旁溅上舱板，爆炸的火花照亮了全船。蒲恩昭挺立在舵台上，眼睛直瞪着前方，紧握着舵把，小船一直向敌人的大兵舰开进。
    敌我的距离，缩短到一百多米的时候，船长下了开火命令。蒲恩昭大声的喊：“同志们！立功当英雄的机会到了，干哪！”一时早已准备好的六○炮、机关枪、步枪、对准敌舰一齐开火。敌人的大兵舰上也集中了它的全部火力对付这只对它威胁很大的小船。炮声掩盖了一切，一颗颗敌人的炮弹不时的在船的上空爆炸。火光中大家都不约而同的回头看看他们最关心的、掌握全船命运的舵手。每一次蒲恩昭坚定的面孔，都给大家一个鼓励。他总是那样镇定，紧握着舵把。小船始终不变方向，在炮弹掀起的巨浪中，颠簸着前进。
    情况突然紧急了，激战中敌舰命中小船的头一炮，打折了篷杆，船篷“刷拉”一下落了下来，小船被压得向半边倾斜。蒲恩昭从船尾上跳下来，整理篷索。就在这个当儿，小船又中了一炮，打断了船桅，大半节桅杆砸下来，整个压在船头上，小船遂浸入水中，船头再中一炮，打了一个盆口似的大洞，海水像喷泉一样的冒上来，立刻灌满了船舱，整个船身眼看着就要被大海吞没。蒲恩昭抓过来一个背包，随手将洞口堵住，但由于洞口过大，背包随即漏下了海里。勇敢的蒲恩昭往返在船面上，上衣已经被弹片打穿了好几个窟窿。他一面鼓励大家继续战斗，一面搜集了四个背包，三个干粮袋，集在一起，才算塞住了那个盆口大的洞口，但一会又被海水鼓上来了。蒲恩昭回头看见牺牲同志的尸体，就含泪搬过来压在上面，才算补好了船。接着他在敌人迫近的射击下，抡起大砍刀，砍断了乱成一团的篷索，把船篷和桅杆一齐推下海，小船才又恢复了平衡，继续向敌舰冲去。离敌人只有六、七十米了，蒲恩昭抓起冲锋枪打了一梭子，不解决问题，就又拿起轻机枪对准敌舰射去。小船接连又中了三炮，打进中舱，炸坏了正在发射的六○炮。蒲恩昭连忙跑过去，两只手抓住已断的炮腿，叫炮手继续发射，连中敌舰三发，随风传过来敌兵的哀叫声。
    小船又被击中二炮，打中了要害，打碎了舵板，遂不由自主的漂下去。敌舰始终不敢放松它，对着它跟踪射击了两个钟头。五号船与敌舰纠缠了五个钟头之久，敌舰未得前进一步，我军主力船队遂顺利通过海峡，在南岸登陆了。
    最后，小船只剩下一把没有把子的秃橹，无篷、无舵，在无边的海面上漂荡着，漏舱早已灌满了海水。蒲恩昭就用一把秃橹拨水继续航行。他仍然满怀信心的准备单船去登陆，但潮流逆转，把他们又漂回北岸来，经过一天一夜，四月一日的黄昏，才被打渔的小船救上岸来。
    师部为了奖励他们打兵舰的功绩，命名五号船为“英雄船”。蒲恩昭立了三大功，荣获“海上英雄”的光荣称号。
    英雄不是一下子就打出来的，蒲恩昭第一次为人民作战，是在辽西会战中，在另一战友的配合下，勇敢插入敌阵，两个人打垮敌人一个营，俘敌三百余，首立战功。
    大陆上的最后一仗，粤桂边追歼战，对手是顽固透顶的桂系白匪第七军。在我军追击的路上，敌人扼守一座控制公路的山头，掩护其主力撤退。蒲恩昭巧妙的利用地形，避开敌人火力，并利用敌人机枪换梭子的空隙冲上山顶，一脚踢开敌人机枪，以一梭子冲锋枪子弹，制服了敌人一个连，生俘敌兵三十余，于是立下了战功。
    我们的英雄蒲恩昭，经得起战斗的考验，也经得起艰苦的磨练，解放湘鄂赣的进军中，正值南方的酷暑，部队冒着热天，翻越九岭山，在病员多于好人的情况下，蒲恩昭背遍了全班病号的东西，行军扛三枝步枪，到宿营地挑水做饭，任劳任怨。排长病重不能走路，蒲恩昭和另外几个同志，用担架抬着他行军。江西全境解放的时候，蒲恩昭又立了功。
    向广东进军时，蒲恩昭保持了已往的光荣，揭发了个别新解放战士的动摇思想，并说服了他们，巩固了部队。粤桂边会战一开始，蒲恩昭脚被扎坏，创口未封，坚持了三千里的追击作战。在两个月的海上练兵中，蒲恩昭被选为水手，学会了使篷、掌舵、摇橹、划桨、撑篙、投锚等全套使船技术。
    蒲恩昭每战必立功，到处作模范，参军以来已立了六大功。蒲恩昭为什么成为这样出色的功臣呢？和解放军里成千万的英雄人物一样，是由于他具有高度的政治觉悟。用蒲恩昭自己的话说：“我是一个受苦的人，参加了自己的队伍，我时刻不忘我是为千千万万和我一样受苦的人打仗。我当过国民党的“中央军”，不管怎么说；我是拿枪打过自己人的，我要立功赎罪；另外，我现在是中国共产党的党员，为了人民，为了祖国，我是不怕牺牲自己的！”
