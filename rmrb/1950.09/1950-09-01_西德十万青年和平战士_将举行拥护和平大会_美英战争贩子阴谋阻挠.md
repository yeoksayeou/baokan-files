　　Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Comprehensive TASS news: West German youth decided to hold a 100,000-person West German Youth Peace Conference in the Ruhr area from September 30th to October 1st. Youth from the German Democratic Republic will also attend. This conference was originally scheduled to be held in Dortmund, but was banned by the puppet mayor of the city under the orders of his American and British masters. The Free German Youth League of West Germany issued a statement stating: The Free German Youth League does not recognize this "ban" and will do everything possible to ensure that 100,000 peace-loving young men and women in the Rhine and Ruhr regions express their will to support peace as scheduled on September 30th and October 1st. Peace cannot be banned. At the same time, the recent representative meetings of young workers in Hamburg, Bremen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, and Schleswig-Holstein also issued a letter to all young workers in West Germany, protesting against the Dortmund pseudo-mayor, calling on young workers to rise up and fight for the abolition of the illegal "ban," and calling on them to actively send representatives to participate in this conference and intensify the collection of signatures for the Stockholm Declaration.
    The Moscow "Komsomolskaya Pravda" specially published an article pointing out: This conference will be a prominent event in the lives of West German youth peace fighters. One hundred thousand peace supporters in West Germany will gather for the first time. They will gather in the Ruhr area, the center of the European war hotbed that the American empire is building. The warmongers are now angrily taking pre-emptive measures to deal with this event. However, West German youth peace fighters will prove with action that no one will succeed in banning the struggle for peace.

　　西德十万青年和平战士
    将举行拥护和平大会       
    美英战争贩子阴谋阻挠
    【新华社三十日讯】综合塔斯社消息：西德青年决定于九月三十日至十月一日在鲁尔区举行十万人的西德青年拥护和平大会。德意志民主共和国青年亦将前往参加。这一大会原定在多特蒙德举行，但竟遭到该城傀儡市长在其美英主子授命下下令禁止。西德自由德国青年联盟为此发表声明称：自由德国青年联盟不承认这种“禁令”，并将尽一切力量，使莱因河上和鲁尔区域的十万爱好和平的青年男女，在九月三十日和十月一日如期表示他们拥护和平的意志。和平是禁止不了的。同时最近举行的西德汉堡、不来梅各城、北莱因——威斯特伐利亚、下萨克森和石勒苏益格——荷尔斯坦因各州青年工人代表会议，亦发表告西德全体青年工人书，向多特蒙德伪市长提出抗议，号召青年工人起来为取消非法“禁令”而斗争，并号召他们积极推派代表参加此次大会和加紧为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名。
    莫斯科《共青真理报》特发表专文指出：这次大会将是西德青年和平战士生活中的一件特出的大事。西德的十万和平拥护者将第一次举行大集合。他们将在美帝正在建立中的欧洲的战争温床中心——鲁尔区聚会。战争贩子现在正在愤愤地以先发制人的手段来对付这一事件。但是，西德的青年和平战士将以行动来证明，要想禁止为和平而作的斗争，谁也不会成功。
