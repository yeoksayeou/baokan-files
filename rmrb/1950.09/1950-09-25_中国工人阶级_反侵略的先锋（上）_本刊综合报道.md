　　The Chinese Working Class - Vanguard of Anti-Aggression (Part 1)
　　-- Comprehensive Report by This Publication
　　Standing at the forefront of building the new China, the Chinese working class is now shouting the resounding slogan from their intense production posts: "Oppose American imperialist aggression, defend world peace!" The Chinese working class has actively participated in the peace signature campaign, serving as the vanguard of anti-aggression, and is striving to defend world peace through the practical movement of intensifying production. Workers and staff in various regions are promoting this movement with great enthusiasm, extending it into the streets, neighborhoods, and villages, involving tens of millions of unorganized masses in the upsurge of the peace signature campaign.

　　The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' General Office has received peace signature figures from some local trade unions, totaling 4,982,092 people. However, the vast majority of local trade unions and industrial trade unions have not yet submitted their signature figures to the ACFTU, so a comprehensive statistic of worker signatures is not yet available.

　　Coal Miners Sign with Soot-Covered Hands

　　In Northeast China, once the Jilin Rubber Factory Trade Union launched the campaign, it immediately achieved 100% signature rate throughout the factory. Workers at the No. 41 Factory's Electrical Repair Shop said, "Imperialist fellows, the people will never allow you to provoke war again. Open your eyes and look at the peace and democracy forces led by the Soviet Union! If you insist on provoking war, we have enough power to defeat you!" All the factory's employees completed signing in less than 20 minutes. On the day the signature campaign was launched at the factory, worker Hao Zhongshui and 17 others completed their daily task of 1,400 flange bolts by 2 PM. Workers at the Hegang Dongshan Coal Mine rushed to sign as soon as they came out of the mine. Everyone wet their soot-covered hands and pressed black fingerprints onto the signature book. One worker raised his black hand and vowed, "Damn American imperialists! If you launch a war, look at our hands!" Some said, "It's more meaningful for us to sign with our black hands. It shows our determination to defend world peace by increasing production!" Xu Xiuyu, the worker who won an award for improving the pneumatic drill, said, "I must carefully study and create even better tools to increase the strength of peaceful construction!" In the ten districts and factory-mining areas of Songjiang's various cities and counties, the number of worker signatures has reached over 99% of all workers. A worker at the Harbin Xinhua Printing House wrote his thoughts on the signature book: "In order to stop American imperialists from provoking war, to consolidate the victory of the new China and defend world peace, and also for the safety of my family's life and the happiness of my children, I am determined to sign my name." Kuang Sisun, a miner at the Songjiang Tuoyaozi Mine, and several workers at the Shuangcheng Minguo Sack Factory could not write their names. They worked hard to learn, and finally learned to sign their own names. Yun Benming, a worker at the Qiqihar Match Factory in Heilongjiang, said, "Defending peace should not only be expressed in words and writing. We must use practical actions, by stepping up production to defend peace!" Wang Jiazheng, the section chief of the factory's administrative office, in order to further express his determination to defend peace, researched and improved the rod-straightening machine. Wu Mingyuan, a worker in the rod-straightening department, created a new record of cutting 530 rods per day, exceeding the original record by 270. The sack department of the Jianhua Factory completed its May production task three days ahead of schedule, exceeding the planned output by 103 sacks. In the Dalian-Lushun area, a total of 104,599 employees signed their names from May 25th to May 31st. For example, all 8,000 workers at the Dalian Shipyard signed. Many factory workers are also supporting world peace with their production achievements, such as Xue Guiying, a worker at the brick factory who repairs brick molds, whose past record was 1,600 repairs a day, which increased to 1,800 after signing.

　　Dedicate Work to Support the Liberation of Taiwan

　　In North China, every employee in Zhangjiakou actively signed their names. In Handan Town, Hebei, the signature of all employees in the town was completed within three days. A trade union group in Wujiagou, Datong, said in a discussion: "The Japanese devils occupied us for so many years, and the workers suffered all kinds of pain. The Communist Party drove away the Japanese, and then came the Kuomintang reactionaries. They oppressed us workers just like the Japanese devils. Finally, our own party, the Communist Party, sacrificed so many lives, shedding blood and sweat, to liberate the workers. We have only just begun to live a free and happy life. The American imperialists are now trying to provoke a war of aggression. But today, the Chinese people have stood up. We must use all our strength to stop American imperialist aggression. We workers must not only sign our names, but also step up production to defend peace!"

　　In Northwest China, all the workers of the Iron Works Department of the Lanzhou Logistics Repair Factory unanimously shouted angrily: Resolutely oppose American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea! Youth League member Gao Sanxue said: "To defend world peace and quickly liberate the oppressed compatriots in Taiwan, I will not only sign my name, but also dedicate a day's work to support the liberation of Taiwan, and guarantee the completion of the production task!" Huo Yongjin said: "To defend world peace, we workers must work hard to produce, overcome difficulties, and save raw materials. I will not only work harder, but also dedicate one and a half days of work!" Zhang Yuexiao said angrily: "If the American imperialists invade China, our working class will smash their dog heads with sledgehammers. I will never be insulted by them again. I will not only sign my name, but also dedicate two days of work!" In just one afternoon, a total of twelve people in the factory dedicated work, totaling twenty-two and a half days of work.

　　"Hey! Truman, Don't Think You Can Scare Us!"

　　In East China, many illiterate older women workers in the lock-nail department of the No. 4 Clothing Factory of the Third Field Army's Logistics Department in Nanjing, traced their names stroke by stroke from their wage slips. An old woman in her sixties said, "It's always more solemn to sign myself than to have someone else sign for me!" Female worker Tian Ying also signed her name for her child. She named her newborn child "Peace," saying, "Let my 'Peace' defend world peace!" Female worker Jiang Peihua had never gone to school. To express her determination to support peace, she picked up a pen and painstakingly traced the names of her eighty-year-old father and her child on the signature book. She said, "Not only do I want peace, but my whole family wants peace!" Lu Xigen and Jiang Hanmin, wireline workers at the Electric Meter Factory, wrote in their work: "...Millions of names on the declaration represent the determination of millions of people to defend peace!" "...The Communist Party's decades of arduous struggle liberated us from misery, especially our working class, who have changed from slaves of the old society to masters of the new China. We especially feel the preciousness and intimacy of this victory. We must resolutely defend the fruits of this victory." Worker Luo Guangcan wrote: "Hey! Truman, don't think you can scare us. We have the confidence to liberate Taiwan. An armed fleet cannot stop our people's victorious liberation of Taiwan. Hmph! Truman, be careful; under the call of the people demanding peace and freedom, your adopted sons - the Chiang Kai-shek bandit and Syngman Rhee, have both been defeated. If you are still not giving up, and want to create a new war, then Hitler's fate will be your fate!"

　　The signature campaign at the Shanghai Logistics Department Dyeing Factory further encouraged the factory's production upsurge. The workers said, "We must dye the cloth more carefully, dye it faster, and dye it better, so that the soldiers can wear satisfactory military uniforms and bravely liberate Taiwan!" In the workshop, the workers were sweating, launching a heated production competition to defend world peace and support the liberation of Taiwan. Many factories in Shanghai launched red flag competitions for peace signatures. When people talked to Luo Xiaomei, an elderly female worker at the Wuxi Shenxin No. 3 Factory, about the issue of peace signatures, she thought of the cruel facts she had personally experienced. She said, "...When the Japanese soldiers invaded China, they trampled us underfoot. One day twelve years ago, the Japanese devils came to my hometown, Dade Village, Houcheng Town, Jiangyin, took away the young people, raped the girls, and burned my three thatched cottages to the ground... Three years later, my husband Xu Guizhao and my younger brother Luo Guilin sailed to Wuxi to do business. The Japanese devils suddenly arrested them, saying they were the New Fourth Army, and their lives were lost like that... We were so miserable that we really had no way out... The suffering I have endured is too deep, we can no longer allow our people to suffer again, and we must not allow American robbers to destroy the good days we are now living... The Women Workers Department of the Federation of Trade Unions has already called on us to sign, we must not only sign quickly, but also step up production and drive Chiang Kai-shek and the American soldiers out of Taiwan!" All the workers at Wuxi Hexin Cloth Factory and many other factory units signed their names, achieving a 100% signature rate.

　　When the trade union at the Jinan Yuhua Match Factory had just prepared the signature table, it was immediately crowded with people on both sides, one layer, two layers, three layers... "I'll sign first!" "Give me a pen quickly!" Ma Fenglan, a twelve-year-old girl, started to sob when she saw people scrambling to sign. People asked her why she was crying. She said, "I also want peace, but I can't write my name!" After signing her name, the young female worker Xu Fengying became even more active in production. In the past, she could pack 4,860 boxes of matches in an eleven-hour workday, but today she packed 5,220 boxes in ten hours. Finally, when counted, the names on the peace signature book were exactly equal to the total number of people in the entire factory, fifty-seven.

　　In Central China, dockworkers in Gao'an County, Jiangxi braved the heavy rain to go to the county federation of trade unions to request to sign their names. All the employees in Linchuan County enthusiastically responded to the peace signature campaign, signing a total of 3,188 names in three days. Ma Youpang in Jingdezhen, because he could not write his name, asked someone to write one for him next to his fingerprint. He said, "One more signature means one more blow to the warmongers."

　　In Southwest China, after Chongqing launched the peace signature campaign on May 24th, a total of 676,222 employees and their families signed their names within half a month. At 6 PM on July 9th, more than 40,000 workers, youth, and students in Chengdu held a torch parade and demonstration at People's Park at 6 PM on the afternoon of July 9th to defend world peace and oppose American aggression. After the meeting, the parade passed through the main streets, chanting slogans such as "Oppose American Imperialist Aggression against Korea and Taiwan!"

　　中国工人阶级——反侵略的先锋（上）
    ——本刊综合报道
    站在建设新中国最前线的中国工人阶级，现在从紧张的生产岗位喊出了响亮的口号：“反对美帝侵略，保卫世界和平！”中国工人阶级积极地参加了和平签名运动，担任反侵略的先锋，并以加紧生产的实际运动为保卫世界和平而努力。各地的职工们大家以高度的热情推进这个运动深入到街头，里弄，乡村里去，使成千万无组织的群众也卷入了和平签名运动的热潮。
    全国总工会办公厅所收到的一部分地方工会缴来的和平签名数字，已达四百九十八万二千零九十二人。但绝大部分地方工会及产业工会尚未将签名数字缴到全总，因此工人方面签名数字，目前还无法作全面统计。
  煤矿工人黑手签名
    在东北，吉林橡胶厂工会一经发动，立刻达到全厂百分之一百的签名，四一厂修电所的工友说：“帝国主义家伙们，你再挑拨战争，人民决不允许，睁开眼睛来瞧瞧苏联老大哥为首的和平民主力量吧，你如果一定要挑动，我们是有足够的力量来打垮你的！”全厂职工不到二十分钟便全部签名完毕，工人郝忠水等十七人，在全厂展开签名运动那天，不到下午二时，就完成了全天一千四百个法兰盘螺丝的任务。鹤岗东山煤矿的工友自坑内上来，就争先恐后的签名，大家把黑黑的手弄湿了，在签名簿上按了黑色的手印，有一位工友举了黑手，发誓说：“狗日的美帝！你要是发动战争，看我们的手吧！”有的说：“我们拿黑手签名更有意思，这表示我们决心用增加生产来保卫世界和平！”改造风镐得奖的徐秀毓工友说：“我一定要细心琢磨，创造出更好的工具，使和平建设力量增加一分！”。松江各市县十个地区厂矿的职工签名数已达所有工人的百分之九十九以上，哈尔滨新华印书馆的一个工友把他心里的话都写到签名书上去了，他写着：“为了制止美帝挑动战争，为了巩固新中国的胜利和保卫世界和平，也为了我家生活安全，孩子们幸福，我决心签上我的名字。”松江驼腰子全矿矿工况思顺以及双城民国麻袋厂工友数人都不会写自己的名字，他们就拚命学写，终于学会了亲自签名。黑龙江齐齐哈尔市火柴厂匀本明工友说：“保卫和平，不应只表示在文字上和口头上，我们要用实际的行动，以加紧生产来保卫和平！”该厂职员王家政股长，为了进一步表示保卫和平的决心，研究改造了理杆机，理杆部武鸣远工友创造每天切五百三十分的新纪录，超过原纪录二百七十分。建华工厂麻袋部提前三天完成五月份的生产任务，还超过一百零三条麻袋产量。旅大职工签名，自五月二十五日至五月三十一日，共计十万四千五百九十九名。如大连修船厂八千名工友全部都签了名，不少工厂的工友并以生产的成绩来拥护世界和平，如砖碍工厂修理砖碍子的薛桂英工友，过去最高纪录是一天修一千六百个，签名后即增至一千八百个。
  献工支援解放台湾
    在华北，张家口市的每一个职工都积极进行了签名。河北邯郸镇，三天内便完成了全镇职工的签名。大同武家沟的一个工会小组在讨论中说：“日本鬼子侵占了多少年，工人们受尽痛苦，共产党打走了日本，又来了国民党反动派，他们和日本鬼子一样的压迫我们工人，好容易，咱们工人自己的党——共产党，又是流血流汗的牺牲了多少生命，才把工人解放出来，我们才开始过着自由、幸福的好日子，美帝竟又想挑动侵略战争了，可是今天中国人民站起来了，我们要用一切力量来制止美帝的侵略，我们工人，不但要签名，而且要以加紧生产来保卫和平！”
    在西北，甘肃兰州后勤修械四厂铁工部全体工友一致怒喊：坚决反对美帝侵略台湾朝鲜！青年团员高三雪说：“为保卫世界和平，赶快解放台湾被压迫的同胞，我不但要签名，而且要献工一个，支援解放台湾，并保证生产任务的完成！”霍永金说：“为保卫世界和平，我们工人阶级要努力生产克服困难，节约原料，我不但要加油生产，还要献工一个半！”张月肖愤怒的说：“美帝如果侵略中国，我们工人阶级拿大锤把他的狗头打烂，我永远再不受他侵侮了，我不但签名，还要献工两个，一个下午的功夫，全厂献工人数共十二人，献工计二十二工半。
  “嘿！杜鲁门，不怕你闹鬼！”
    在华东，南京三野后勤军需部被服四厂锁钉部的女工们，许多不识字的老大娘，都按照自己工资折上的名字，一笔一划的描下来，一位六十多岁的老大娘说：“叫别人代签总不如自己签来得郑重！”女工田英给自己的孩子也签上了名，她给刚生的孩子取名“和平”，她说：“让我的‘和平’来保卫世界和平！”女工江佩华没有上过学，为了表示拥护和平的决心，拿起了笔，很艰难地把她八十岁的老父亲以及小孩的名字都描在签名簿上，她说：“不只我要和平，一家老小都要和平！”电照厂有线电工人陆锡根、蒋汉民在自己的作品里写着：“………宣言书上千百万个名字代表着千万人民保卫和平的决心！”“……共产党几十年艰苦的斗争，使我们从水深火热中解放出来，尤其是我们工人阶级，由旧社会的奴隶变为新中国的主人，我们格外感到这胜利的宝贵和亲切，我们要坚决保卫这胜利的果实。”工人罗光灿写道：“嘿！杜鲁门，不怕你闹鬼，我们有信心解放台湾，武装舰队阻止不了我们人民胜利的解放台湾。哼！杜鲁门，当心一点；在人民要求和平自由的呼声下，你的干儿子——蒋家贼和李承晚，都吃了败仗，如果你心不死，还要制造新的战争，那么希特勒的下场就是你的下场！”
    上海后勤部染整厂通过这次签名运动，更鼓励了厂里的生产热潮，工友们都说：“我们要更认真的染布，染得快，染得好，让战士们穿上称心的军服，英勇的去解放台湾！”工场里，工友们汗流浃背，为了保卫世界和平，支援解放台湾，展开了热烈的生产竞赛，上海市的许多工厂都展开了和平签名的红旗竞赛。无锡申新三厂老年女工罗小妹当人家与她谈起和平签名的问题时，她就想起了她亲身所经历的惨酷事实，她说：“……东洋兵打进中国把我们踏在脚底下，十二年前的一天，东洋鬼子到了我的家乡江阴厚城镇大德村的村庄，拉走了年青人，姑娘们被强奸，我的三间草房也被一把火烧得精光。……三年以后，我的男人徐贵照和我阿弟罗桂林撑船到无锡做生意，东洋鬼子突然把他们抓走，说他们是新四军，性命就这样送掉了，……我们苦得真是走头无路啊……。我所受的苦楚实在太深了，再不能让我们百姓再受罪了，不许美国强盗来破坏现在所过的好日子……。总工会女工部已经号召我们签名，我们不但要快点签名，还要加紧生产，把蒋该死和美国兵赶出台湾去！”无锡和新布厂等许多厂单位，全厂百分之一百的工友都签了名。
    济南裕华火柴厂当工会刚准备好签名桌，两旁立刻挤满了人群，一层，两层，三层，……“我先签！”“快给我笔！”十二岁的马凤兰见到人家争着签名，竟在一旁抽抽噎噎的哭起来了，人家问她为什么哭？她说：“我也愿意和平，可是我不会写自己的名字！”青年女工徐凤英签名以后，生产更加积极了，过去每天十一小时的工作中能装四千八百六十盒火柴，今天在十小时中就装了五千二百二十盒。最后数一数，和平签名书上的名字，恰恰等于全厂所有的人数五十七名。
    在华中，江西高安县码头工人冒着大雨去县总工会要求签名，临川县全县职工热烈响应和平签名运动，三天内共签三千一百八十八名，景德镇马有胖因不会写自己的名字，就请人家在旁边给他写一个，他说：“多签一个名，就给战争贩子多一份打击。”
    在西南，重庆自五月二十四日发起和平签名运动后，在半个月内，职工及其家属共计有六十七万六千二百二十二人签名。七月九日下午六时，成都市四万余工人青年学生为保卫世界和平反对美国侵略，于九日下午六时在人民公园举行火炬游行示威大会。会后游行队伍通过各主要街道，沿途高呼“反对美帝侵略朝鲜台湾！”等口号。
