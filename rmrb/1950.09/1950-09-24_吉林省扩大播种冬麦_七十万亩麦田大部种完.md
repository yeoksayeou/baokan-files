　　Jilin Province Expands Winter Wheat Planting
    700,000 Mu of Wheat Fields Mostly Sown
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Jilin Province's plan to promote over 700,000 mu of winter wheat this year is now mostly completed. Last year, the province trial-planted over 100,000 mu of winter wheat, and this year saw a large harvest. In counties like Dunhua, Jiaohe, and Shulan, the average yield was over five shi per qing (one qing equals ten mu), with the highest reaching seven shi (general spring wheat can only yield around three shi). Both the quality and yield surpassed spring wheat. Farmers who planted winter wheat have all obtained substantial benefits. For example, farmers in Huangdian District, Jiaohe County, earned 3.76 billion yuan (Northeast currency) from selling winter wheat seeds alone. Therefore, this year, many districts and villages in counties such as Shulan, Dehui, Yongji, Dunhua, Nongan, and Wangqing are actively expanding their winter wheat planting area. The province's planting area has increased by 600,000 mu compared to last year, with Jiaohe County increasing from 40,000 mu of winter wheat last year to 110,000 mu this year. The winter wheat planting model mutual aid team of Wang Deyi in Dunhua County, which planted over 130 mu last year, has expanded its planting area to 300 mu this year.
    Governments at all levels in the province attach great importance to the promotion of winter wheat. In addition to timely summarizing last year's planting experience and printing it into booklets for distribution to farmers, they have also promptly carried out various preparatory work such as purchasing and distributing seeds.
    Winter wheat sowing began successively in various counties in late August. Many counties organized a large number of cadres to go deep into districts and villages to provide technical guidance. For example, the Agricultural Science Department of the Jiaohe County People's Government assigned seven cadres to Ulin, Xinzhan, and other districts where winter wheat planting failed last year, to cooperate with district cadres in going deep into villages and providing specific guidance to farmers on sowing. Dunhua County organized 22 cadres to study winter wheat planting experience intensively and then went to key districts to provide technical guidance. Under the guidance of cadres, over 80 percent of the 1,400 mu of winter wheat in Dehui County was planted in black soil suitable for winter wheat growth. To prevent winter wheat smut disease, the Nongan County Agriculture and Forestry Department loaned out 800 jin of Wang copper sulfate to guide farmers in disinfection before sowing.

　　吉林省扩大播种冬麦
    七十万亩麦田大部种完
    【本报讯】吉林全省今年计划推广的七十多万亩冬麦，现已大部种完。去年该省试种了十万多亩冬麦，今年大部丰收。敦化、蛟河、舒兰等县平均一垧地（一垧十亩）产麦五石多，最高的达到七石（一般小麦只能打三石左右）。质量产量均超过春麦。种冬麦的农民都获得了优厚的收益。如蛟河县黄甸区农民，仅卖冬麦种籽即收入三十七亿六千万元（东北币）。因此，今年已有舒兰、德惠、永吉、敦化、农安、汪清等县许多区村农民积极扩大种冬麦面积。今年全省播种面积较去年增加六十万亩，其中蛟河县由去年的四万亩冬麦增到今年的十一万亩。敦化县种植冬麦模范王德义互助组，去年种了一百三十多亩，今年扩大播种面积为三百亩。
    该省各级人民政府对冬麦推广工作均极重视，除及时地总结了去年种植经验，印成小册子发给农民外，并及时进行了收购、发放种籽等各项准备工作。
    八月下旬各县冬麦即陆续下种，不少县份组织了大批干部深入区、村进行技术指导。如蛟河县人民政府农业科，配备七名干部到去年种植冬麦失败的乌林、新站等区，配合区干部深入村屯，具体指导农民播种。敦化县组织了二十二名干部，集中学习了种冬麦经验后，分赴重点区作技术指导。德惠县农民在干部指导下，一千四百亩冬麦，百分之八十以上的是种在适合冬麦生长的黑土地里。为防止冬麦黑穗病，农安县农林科贷出了王铜八百斤，指导农民在播种前进行消毒。
