　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 23rd: The Central Standing Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front issued the "Second Investigation Report on the Atrocities of American Armed Interventionists and the Li Seung-man Gang" on the 16th. The report recounts the facts of the American aggressors' air force indiscriminately bombing peaceful Korean towns and villages, residential areas, cultural facilities, and non-military industrial institutions during the two months from the beginning of July to the beginning of September, as well as the atrocities of the US-Li bandit army in burning, killing, raping, looting.

　　The report detailed the number of Korean patriots and people massacred by the US-Li bandit army during their retreat. From June 28th to July 4th, the US-Li bandit army massacred 1,146 patriots and innocent people in Suwon; 2,060 in Chungju; more than 600 in Gongju; more than 600 in Pyeongtaek; more than 500 in Anseong; more than 2,000 in Buyeo; 158 in Jochiwon; 8,644 in Daejeon; more than 2,000 in Cheongju; more than 4,000 in Jeonju; more than 400 in Gunsan; and more than 400 in Anyang.

　　On July 2nd, when the American aggressor army and puppet army military police retreated to Chungui-dong Village, Chungju District, Chungju County, they arrested a large number of workers, farmers, and students, forced them to retreat together, and killed the elderly with bayonets.

　　On July 8th, dozens of American soldiers, with five machine guns mounted on trucks, invaded Maecheon-ri, Yeongdong District, Yeongdong County, and under the pretext of forcing evacuation, dragged more than 70 villagers to the mountains and shot them to death, then looted the village's property.

　　On July 19th, while retreating from Daejeon, the American army scattered gasoline in densely populated residential areas, shops, and cultural institutions such as Jikjung-dong, Jeong-dong, Won-dong, Daeheung-dong, and In-dong, setting them on fire. As a result, 3,740 houses, 35 institutions, 140 peaceful factories, 9 schools, and 12 hospitals were completely reduced to ashes.

　　On July 28th, a 67-year-old sick man at 47 Gwan-ri, Hwanggeum District, Yeongdong County, was hanged alive on a wooden stake by American soldiers because he had not evacuated.

　　The report concluded: The Korean people's hatred for the enemy has reached its extreme! They are filled with fighting spirit and determined to persist in the struggle against the American colonial plunderers, for the freedom and independence of their motherland, until final victory.

    七天内残杀二万余人
    朝鲜祖国战线发表第二号调查报告
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央常务委员会，于十六日发表“关于美国武装干涉者与李承晚匪帮暴行调查报告第二号”。报告历述了美国侵略者的空军在从七月初到九月初的两个月中滥炸朝鲜和平城乡、住宅区域、文化设施及非军事性的产业机关的事实及美李匪军烧、杀、奸淫掳掠的暴行。
    报告详细举出了美李匪军在撤退时屠杀朝鲜爱国者及人民的数字。从六月二十八日到七月四日，美、李匪军在水原市屠杀了爱国者与无辜人民一千一百四十六名；在忠州屠杀了二千零六十名；在公州屠杀了六百余名；在平泽屠杀了六百余名；在安城屠杀了五百余名；在扶余屠杀了二千余名；在鸟致院屠杀了一百五十八名；在大田屠杀了八千六百四十四名；在清州屠杀了二千余名；在全州屠杀了四千余名；在群山屠杀了四百余名；在安阳屠杀了四百余名。
    报告举例说明美、李匪军到处残杀人民、奸淫妇女、抢劫财产、焚烧民房的罪行：七月初，美军五名侵入永同县永同区熙洞里，把该村庄的家庭妇女金三顺装在汽车上，加以轮奸后枪杀。
    七月二日，美侵略军和伪军宪兵退到忠州县忠州区忠义洞村庄时，大批逮捕工人、农民和学生，强迫他们一起撤退，并用刺刀杀死老年人。
    七月八日，美军数十人在卡车上架着五挺机枪，侵入永同县永同区梅川里，以强迫逃难为名，将村民七十余人拉到山上枪杀，然后抢劫了村里的财产。
    七月十八日，美军三人侵入忠清南道大德县杞城区的农家，将男人赶走后，对家庭妇女金翰女施以轮奸。
    七月十九日，大田市内的美军一面撤退，一面在疾中洞、正洞、原洞、大兴洞、仁洞等居民住宅、商店及文化机关密集地区散布汽油，放火焚烧。结果，三千七百四十所住宅、三十五所机关、一百四十所和平工厂、九所学校、十二所医院完全变成灰烬。
    七月二十八日，永同县黄金区官里四十七番地的六十七岁的患病老人，因未逃难，被美军吊在木桩上活活勒死。
    报告在结语中称：朝鲜人民对于仇敌的愤恨已达极点！他们充满了斗志，决心为反对美国殖民地掠夺者，为自己祖国的自由独立而坚持斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
