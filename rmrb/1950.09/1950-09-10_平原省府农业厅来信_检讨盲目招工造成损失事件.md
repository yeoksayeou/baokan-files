　　Letter from the Agriculture Department of the Pingyuan Provincial Government: Self-Criticism of the Loss Caused by Blind Recruitment
    Editor:
    We immediately conducted a self-criticism of the criticism made by Comrade Zhao Zhongming of the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office regarding our department's blind recruitment incident, which was published in the People's Garden on August 27th. We are now informing you of the facts and our self-criticism:
    At the request of the Bo'ai County State-Run Mechanized Farm, our department telegraphed the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office on July 23rd to recruit 200 workers for ditch repair work, with a duration of three months. Each person's daily wage was seven jin of rice. On July 27th, a letter of opinion from the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office, forwarded by the Provincial Labor Bureau, inquired about the recruitment issues such as travel expenses, wages, and cadre supplies. While we were preparing to reply, we received a letter from the Bo'ai Mechanized Farm stating that the Ministry of Agriculture and the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau would be transporting machinery after the rainy season to repair the ditches, and seeking our consent. At that time, our department did not fully agree with this measure of the Bo'ai Mechanized Farm, but because we were unclear about the situation, we could not give a definite reply. Therefore, on August 2nd, we replied to the Mechanized Farm, stating that we could not guarantee the use of machinery for repairs and that manual repairs were still preferable. We asked them to consider this. On August 6th, Comrade Xu Xinmin of the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office came to the department to discuss the workers' treatment, travel expenses, and resettlement grain, and explained that if the department did not provide a clear answer to the above questions, they would not dare to mobilize workers to come. Because of inconvenient communication between our department and the Bo'ai Mechanized Farm, we asked Comrade Xu to personally visit the farm for a discussion. At this time, Secretary Liang of the farm happened to come to the department and said that the Mechanized Farm no longer needed workers, so we asked Comrade Xu to return to the Prefectural Commissioner's Office to convey the above opinion. We thought that this matter was over and paid no further attention. On August 7th, we received another letter from Liaocheng, forwarded by the Labor Bureau, stating that approximately one hundred workers from Shou Zhang had been recruited to go to the Bo'ai Mechanized Farm to build ditches and would be sent on the 8th or 9th; the remaining vacancies were difficult to fill due to the busy farming season. We immediately telegraphed to order a halt to the mobilization and instructed the workers who had not yet departed to stop coming. Since then, there has been no further news. Therefore, we thought that the recruitment incident had come to a smooth conclusion. On August 27th, Deputy Commissioner Ma of the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office brought a letter to the department to discuss the issue of losses incurred due to the recruitment, and we realized that this issue still needed to be resolved. We immediately asked them to report the accounts and the details of the situation to the department for study and resolution.
    When we initially requested 200 workers from the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office, we did not clearly explain the issues of the leading cadres, travel expenses, and resettlement grain, which caused difficulties for them during recruitment. This was the result of our careless work. On July 27th, after receiving the letter of inquiry forwarded by the Provincial Labor Bureau, we did not reply immediately, which demonstrated the procrastination in our work style. After receiving the letter from the Bo'ai Mechanized Farm on the 29th, we also failed to handle it in a timely manner. This shows that we do not adequately inspect the work of our subordinates and our understanding of the situation is also poor. Although Comrade Xu came to the department and reflected some of the situation, we failed to further inquire about the recruitment situation, and we did not study the letter, but subjectively determined that the workers had not yet been mobilized. When we received the letter forwarded by the Provincial Labor Bureau on August 7th (stating that approximately one hundred workers would be coming on the 8th or 9th), we still did not feel the seriousness of the problem, and only replied by telegram saying: workers who have not departed should not come. However, we still did not consider how to deal with the workers who had already gathered. It was not until Deputy Commissioner Ma came to the department to explain the situation that we felt the problem was serious and needed to be resolved quickly. All of the above facts demonstrate that our work style is bureaucratic, that we are usually high above, do not understand the situation below, and handle things only from a subjective point of view. As a result, state property has suffered undue losses, and the prestige of the Party and the government has been damaged.
    We are now combining rectification to initially examine and summarize the work of the past year. We sincerely accept the criticism from the Liaocheng Industrial and Commercial Section, and we are determined to overcome this shortcoming in our future work. We also hope that other relevant departments can promptly point out the shortcomings in our work in order to change our work style and improve work efficiency.

　　平原省府农业厅来信
    检讨盲目招工造成损失事件编辑同志：
    八月二十七日人民园地刊登了聊城专署赵仲鸣同志对本厅盲目招工事件的批评，我们当即作了检讨。兹将事实经过及我们的检讨告诉你们：
    本厅曾应博爱县国营机耕农场之请，于七月二十三日电聊城专署招收工人二百名，作修理水渠工作。时间为三个月。每人每天的工资为七斤米。七月二十七日，由省劳动局转来聊城专署的意见书一封，请示关于招工的路费、工资、干部供给等问题。当我们正准备答复的时候，即接到博爱机耕农场来信，说在雨季以后中央农业部及省水利局将运来机器，以便修理水渠，并征求我们的同意。当时本厅对博爱机耕农场这种措置不甚同意，但因不明情况，未能作肯定的答复，乃在八月二日函复机耕农场，说明不能保证用机器来修理，还是以人工修理为好。请他们考虑。八月六日，聊城专署徐莘民同志到厅面商工人待遇、路费、安家粮等问题，并说明倘以上问题得不到厅方的明确答复，他们不敢发动工人前来。本厅与博爱机耕农场间因通信不便，遂请徐同志亲赴该农场面谈。此时，恰好该场梁秘书来厅，说机耕农场不再要工人，即请徐同志回专署转达上述意见。我们认为此事已成过去，不再注意了。八月七日，又接劳动局转来聊城一信，说赴博爱机耕农场修筑水渠的工人，寿张已招收百人左右，八九日即可送去；其余缺额，因届农忙期间，未便招收。我们当即电嘱停止动员，并令未动身的工人停止前来。此后即无音信。因此，我们以为招工事件已顺利结束。八月二十七日，聊城专署马副专员持信来厅谈因招工所受的损失问题，始知这一问题尚须解决。我们即请他们将帐目及经过情况报告厅方，以便研究解决。
    当我们初次向聊城专署要二百名工人时，对于领队干部、路费、安家粮等，均没有明确说明，使他们在招工时感到困难。这是我们工作粗枝大叶所造成的结果。七月二十七日我们接到省劳动局转来的请示信后，未即电复，表现了我们工作作风的拖拉。二十九日接博爱机耕农场来信后，我们又不能及时处理。这说明我们平时对下级的工作检查不够，了解情况也很差。其间虽经徐同志来厅反映了一些情况，也未能进一步的问明招工情形，对来信亦未加研究，即主观地断定工人尚未动员。当我们在八月七日接到省劳动局转来的来信时（说百名左右工人于八、九日即可前来），仍未感到问题的严重，只复电说：未动身的工人勿前来。但对如何处理已集中的工人问题，仍未考虑。直到马副专员来厅说明情况时，我们方感到问题严重，必须迅速解决。以上事实，都说明我们的工作作风是官僚主义的作风，平时高高在上，不了解下情，处理事情只从主观出发。因而使国家财产受到不应有的损失，使党与政府的威信受到了损害。
    我们现在正结合整风，初步检查与总结一年来的工作。我们诚恳接受聊城工商科对我们的批评，决心在今后工作中克服这个缺点。并望其他有关部门，也能及时指出我们工作中的缺点，以改变我们的工作作风，提高工作效率。
