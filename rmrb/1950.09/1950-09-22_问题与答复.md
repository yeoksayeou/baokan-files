　　Questions and Answers
　　Question: In the People's Daily editorial on March 22nd, "The Role of Taxation in Our National Work," we encountered the following questions: (1) Regulating profits and income, that is, having the effect of protecting labor and restraining capital. (2) Having an encouraging and restrictive effect on production. (3) Centralizing the country's scattered assets and using them in directions that are of decisive significance to the country's current situation. (4) Levying income tax and business tax on state-owned enterprises can promote the establishment of the economic accounting system in these enterprises.
　　The above four effects are all economic effects. How should "protecting labor" and "economic accounting system" be explained? Why can taxes be used to "centralize the country's scattered assets"? What are the "country's scattered assets" referred to here? Finally, we hope that you can give a specific example of each of the above four effects so that our learning can be more in-depth.

　　Answer: First, the people's government's taxation is used as a weapon to implement New Democratic social policies, the purpose of which is to adjust the distribution of social income. For example, the industrial and commercial tax adjusted at the Second National Tax Conference stipulates that those with income less than 3 million yuan are taxed at 5%, and when the income exceeds 3 million yuan, the progressive tax rate is divided into 20 levels, and when the income exceeds 100 million yuan, the tax is 30%. This means that although they are both profit-making businesses, the applicable tax rates vary depending on the total amount of income. The higher the income, the stronger the ability to bear the tax, and the more tax should be paid to the state. The state uses the proceeds from taxation for the people. This is a concrete manifestation of regulating profits, regulating income, restricting exploitation, and protecting the interests of the working people.
　　Second, the people's government's taxation is also used as a weapon to implement New Democratic economic policies. The people's government adopts an encouraging policy in taxation for production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and conversely, it gives restrictions. For example, the commodity tax rates revised at the Second National Tax Conference stipulated that the tax rate for coal, iron, and wheat flour is 3%, soap, electrical materials, and hardware are 5%, while the tax rate for superstitious items such as tin foil and yellow paper, and luxury goods such as perfume and rouge are set at 80%. Cigarettes are levied according to four levels, from 90% to 120%, and foreign wine is 100%. In addition, in the industrial and commercial tax regulations, based on the principle of "industry is lighter than commerce," there are also provisions for reducing the scope of tax on industries taxed according to income. According to the industrial and commercial tax regulations, industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, such as machinery manufacturing, mining and metallurgy, electricity, manufacturing of cultural, educational, and health supplies, and transportation, are given a reduction of 10% to 40% on the taxable portion of their income, depending on the degree of benefit. The more beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, the more the reduction. All these regulations are to promote the transfer of social funds to the industrial sector, so our tax policy can have an encouraging and restrictive effect on social production. Of course, we are not "all industries are light." For example, superstition and luxury cosmetics, although they are also industries, are not rewarded.
　　Third, the people's government's taxation is also one of the important weapons of the New Democratic financial policy. Article 40 of the Common Program clearly stipulates: From a financial point of view, in addition to ensuring the supply of the revolutionary war, taxation is an important means of accumulating national construction funds. The so-called "centralizing the country's scattered assets" refers to the part of the national income that should bear taxes. It was originally scattered in the hands of the people and must be concentrated through taxation and used for undertakings that are of decisive significance to the country's current situation. For example, this year it is planned to be used for military needs, supporting millions of military, government, and public educators, production and disaster relief, and key economic recovery.
　　Fourth, "high output, good quality, and low cost" are indispensable standards for the operation and management of each enterprise unit. To achieve such standards, it is necessary to establish accurate calculation and strict management systems for production raw materials, losses, depreciation, expenses, profits, production efficiency, capital turnover, etc., that is, it is necessary to implement an economic accounting system. In the past, some state-owned enterprises did not calculate costs, pay attention to efficiency, or pay taxes. When the finished products produced were taken to the market for sale, although the prices were similar to those of private enterprises and could compete with general commodities on the market, the actual costs were high and the profits were small. This time, the people's government decided to levy business tax on state-owned enterprises, which prompted all state-owned enterprises to calculate carefully in order to complete the task of paying taxes and extracting profits, and had to establish an economic accounting system as soon as possible.

　　问题与答复
    问：人民日报三月二十二日《税收在我们国家工作中的作用》一篇社论中，我们遇到了如下的问题：（一）调节利润，调节收益，即有保护劳动和节制资本的作用。（二）在生产上有鼓励和限制的作用。（三）集中国家的分散着的资财，用到对国家当前有决定意义的方向。（四）对国营企业征收所得税和营业税，则可以促进该企业的经济核算制的建立。
    上述四种作用，均是一种经济作用，其中的“保护劳动”“经济核算制”作如何解释？把“国家的分散资财集中起来”，为什么通过税收可以集中起来？这儿指的“国家的分散资财”是什么？最后希望你们能将上述的四种作用分别举一个具体例子，以使我们的学习更能深入一步。（天津邮政管理局文书股学习小组）
    答：一、人民政府的税收是作为实行新民主主义社会政策的武器来运用的，其目的是要借以调整社会所得的分配。例如二届全国税务会议调整后的工商业税，便规定所得额未满三百万元者一律课税百分之五，超过三百万元时，其累进税率分二十级，至所得额超过一亿元时，便课税百分之三十。这就是说，同是营利事业，因其所得总额不同，适用的税率也就轻重不同，所得越多的，负担力越强，向国家纳的税也就应该更多。国家从征税所获，又用之于人民。这就是调节利润、调节收益、限制剥削与保护劳动人民利益的具体表现。
    二、人民政府的税收，也是作为实行新民主主义经济政策的武器来运用的。对有利于国计民生的生产事业，人民政府在税收方面一律采取鼓励的政策，反之，则给以限制。例如在二届全国税务会议上修订的货物税税率，规定煤铁麦粉税率为百分之三，肥皂电料五金为百分之五，而迷信品如锡箔、黄表等，奢侈品如香水胭脂等税率规定为百分之八十，卷烟按四级征收，从百分之九十至百分之一百二十，洋酒为百分之一百。此外，在工商业税条例中，本“工轻于商”的原则，对于依所得额征税的行业，又有减征范围之规定，按照工商业税条例，对机器制造业、矿冶业、电业、文教卫生用品制造业、运输业等对于国计民生有利的工业，均按其有利的程度，就其所得计税部分，分别减征百分之十至百分之四十。越是对国计民生有益的就减征越多。所有这些规定，都是为了促使社会资金转移到工业部门来，所以我们的税收政策是能够对社会生产发生鼓励与限制作用的。当然，我们也并不是“凡工都轻”，例如迷信、化装奢侈品类，虽然也是工业，但并不受到奖励。
    三、人民政府的税收，同时也是新民主主义财政政策的重要武器之一。共同纲领第四十条有明确的规定：从财政上讲，除了保证革命战争供给外，税收是积累国家建设资金的重要手段。所谓“集中国家分散着的资财”，即指国民收入中应负担税捐的部分，原系分散在国民手里，必须通过征税的方法，把它集中起来，用到国家当前有决定意义的事业上去。如今年有计划地使用于军事需要、养活数百万军政公教人员、生产救灾及重点恢复经济等即是。
    四、“产量多，质量好，成本低”，是每个企业单位经营管理不可缺少的标准，要达到这样的标准，就必须对生产原料、损耗、折旧、开支、利润，生产效率，资金周转等等建立精确计算与严格的管理制度，就是必须实施经济核算制。以往有些国营企业不计算成本，不讲究效率，也不纳税，生产出来的成品拿到市场上去出售时，虽与私营企业的产品价格差不多，也能与市场上一般商品竞争；但实际上成本是高的，利润是很少的。此次人民政府决定向国营企业征收营业税，就使所有的国营企业，为了完成纳税和提取利润的任务，便促进了企业单位的精打细算，不得不从速建立经济核算制。
