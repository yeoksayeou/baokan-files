What I Saw of the Korean People's Army
By Our Correspondent on the Korean Front, Li Zhuang

　　There is a common saying among the Korean People's Army: "When the Americans come, eat them up." The People's Army has seen enough of the Americans' bloody atrocities, and their eyes turn red as soon as they encounter American soldiers' positions. They understand very well why they are fighting.

　　I spoke with a 24-year-old People's Army soldier named Kim Jae-wook, from Anbyon County, Gangwon Province, of peasant origin, who joined the army in October 1948. In the Battle of Daejeon, he killed three American soldiers with a submachine gun in one go.

　　Kim Jae-wook is always cheerful, even laughing amidst the sound of enemy planes bombing. I once deliberately asked him, "Do you miss home?" He smiled and said, "Old soldiers don't miss home." "What about your parents?" He replied, "I think about them in peacetime, but not during wartime." This June, after the war broke out, Kim Jae-wook's wife took a train from Anbyon to Pyongyang to see him. Before leaving, she instructed him on three things: first, he should recognize that he is a soldier of the People's Army and fight well; second, after the victory of the patriotic reunification war, he should go home and visit; and third, that everything at home is fine, and he should not worry. Her instructions further increased his courage to kill the enemy.

　　I have asked many soldiers of the People's Army, and their situations are similar to Kim Jae-wook's. Kim's family has five members: his parents, himself, and his wife and daughter. Before "August 15th" (Liberation Day), his family rented 1,000 pyeong (Chinese mu is equal to 200 Korean pyeong) of paddy fields and 200 pyeong of dry land. After being heavily exploited by the Japanese and landlords, the remaining grain was not enough to eat. In the land reform implemented in North Korea the year before last, his family was allocated 1,800 pyeong of paddy fields and 300 pyeong of dry land. Last year, he harvested seven seok of white rice and three seok of miscellaneous grains. He grew his own cotton and hemp and wove clothing materials, becoming a well-off family. With the full consent of his mother and wife, he resolutely joined the People's Army.

　　In a remote mountain village at the front, I met a female nurse named Lee Chun-bong. She was only nineteen years old, wearing a neat uniform and a squad leader's (equivalent to our platoon leader) badge. In July 1949, the Lee Seung-man bandit army crossed the 38th parallel to attack Songaksan Mountain. As a nurse at a local tuberculosis hospital, she participated in frontline rescue work. A total of twenty or so female nurses from the local area participated in this battle with her, sixteen of whom later joined the army. At that time, Lee Chun-bong personally witnessed the puppet army's unreasonable attacks and the invaders' artillery bombardment of North Korea. She had requested to join the army several times, but was turned down. The unit said, "We don't need many people now, we'll talk about it later!" Lee Chun-bong waited patiently and enthusiastically studied battlefield rescue techniques. It was not until the war continued to develop that she was allowed to put on a uniform.

　　"Of course," she said, "life in the army is harder than when I was in the hospital. In the tuberculosis hospital, the government provided food and clothing. I also received a salary of 1,200 won per month. Now, it's a little less, but I am fighting for the independence and unification of my country, so what does a little hardship matter? Men fight, and we can at least be nurses."

　　Lee Chun-bong talked about her life before liberation. She only had an old mother; they rented a few mu of poor land from the landlord and couldn't even eat their fill of potatoes. After "August 15th," North Korea vigorously developed industry. Several of her cousins went to work in factories and supported her mother. Now, they eat three meals a day, all of rice. She received help from the state, graduated from nursing school, and became a technician. She said, "Without our good country, I wouldn't be where I am today. I will contribute all my strength to her."

　　This spirited nineteen-year-old girl is not yet engaged. She said, "That's a matter for after the war. Now is wartime. We're talking here now, but in a moment we don't know where we'll be going. We have to go through water and fire." Lee Chun-bong misses her mother very much. She expressed this repeatedly. The more she thinks of her mother, the more she must work hard to win the war as soon as possible and go back to see her.

　　I have spoken with many soldiers of the People's Army and found that they all have similar thoughts and experiences to these two young people. This explains why the victory of Korea's patriotic reunification war has been able to expand and consolidate so rapidly. American prisoners say that when they first encountered the People's Army's charging tanks, they thought the tankers must be Soviets or Chinese. After being captured, they were shocked to see robust Korean youths jumping out of the turrets and regretted coming so "rashly."

　　Countless heroes have emerged both at the front and in the rear. Twenty-six-year-old squad leader Shin Young-rok had performed seven great feats in the past anti-Japanese war and was known as a combat model. On June 29th, he was ordered to lead an assault squad to attack Hill 330 south of Hwacheon (belonging to Gangwon Province). The enemy formed three lines of defense with six companies, firing fiercely at the People's Army with various firepower from the high ground. Shin Young-rok led the assault squad crawling forward. After approaching the high ground, they immediately charged the enemy with bayonets. The enemy's first line of defense was breached, and Shin Young-rok was also wounded in the arm. The company commander advised him to leave the line of fire, but he said, "Although I am wounded, the mission is not yet complete." He stood in front of the entire team and continued to advance. After he was wounded a second time and fell to the ground, the enemy's second and third lines of defense were broken through. Shin Young-rok used to be a liberated peasant, and now his bullet wounds are almost healed.

　　The rapid liberation of Yinseong, Icheon (both in northern Chungcheongbuk-do), and other places should mainly be attributed to an anonymous engineering hero, Kong Seong-soo, who made a huge contribution to this battle. He is a 26-year-old soldier of peasant origin who is very good at swimming. At that time, Yeoju (in Gyeonggi-do) had just been liberated, and the unit's mission was to advance rapidly, not allowing the enemy to catch their breath. The pursuing troops encountered a major difficulty: the bridge over the Icheon River had been destroyed by enemy aircraft. An engineering company received an order to guide the troops to swim across the river. Under the threat of enemy aircraft, Kong Seong-soo worked tirelessly day and night, guiding one hundred people across the river every hour. From July 3rd to 9th, he guided 5,000 more people across the river than ordinary engineers, almost equivalent to half a division's strength. From the outside, he is also a very ordinary soldier, honest and humble. But in combat, he showed amazing energy.

　　There are tens of thousands of such people in the Korean People's Army. They have written an unprecedented great victory in the history of the Korean revolution with their blood. The happy Korean descendants will forever praise their ancestors—the immortal achievements of these people's heroes.

### 我见到的朝鲜人民军

　　我见到的朝鲜人民军
    本报特派朝鲜战地记者  李庄
    在朝鲜人民军中，普遍地流行着这么一句话：“美国人来，吃掉它。”人民军看够了美国人的血腥暴行，他们一遇到美国兵的阵地，眼珠子立刻就红了。他们十分懂得自己为什么打仗。
    我曾和一个二十四岁的人民军战士谈话。他名叫金在沃，江原道安边县人，贫农出身，一九四八年十月入伍。在大田战斗中，他一次用冲锋枪打死了三个美国兵。
    金在沃什么时候都是愉快的，在敌机的轰炸声中，他还是笑着。我曾经故意问他：“现在想家吗？”他笑着说：“老战士不想家。”“父母呢？”他回答：“在平时是想的，战时就谈不上了。”今年六月，战争爆发后，金在沃的妻子从安边坐火车到平壤来看他，临走时嘱咐了三件事：一、应该认识自己是个人民军，好好打仗；二、爱国统一战争胜利后，回家看看；三、家事很好，不必挂念。她的嘱咐益发增加了他的杀敌勇气。
    我问过许多人民军的战士，他们的情形都和金在沃的相类似。金的家庭共有五口人，父母之外，有金和他的妻女。“八一五”前，他家租种一千坪水田（中国一亩等于朝鲜二百坪），二百坪旱地，经过日寇和地主的重重剥削，所余粮食还不够吃。前年北朝鲜实行土地改革，他家分到一千八百坪水田，三百坪旱地。去年收获七石白米，三石杂粮，自己种棉麻，织衣料，成了一个小康之家。他商得母亲和妻子的完全同意，毅然参加了人民军。
    在前方偏僻的山村中，我遇见一个名叫李春凤的女看护。她只有十九岁，穿着整洁的制服，带着分队长（相当我国的班长）的证章。一九四九年七月，李承晚匪军曾越过三八线进攻松岳山，她以一个地方结核病院看护的资格，参加了前线的救护工作。和她一起参加这次战斗的，共有二十多名地方上来的女看护，其中十六名以后都参军了。那时李春凤亲眼看到伪军的无理进攻，侵略者的炮火向北朝鲜轰击，她曾经几次请求参军，结果都被谢绝。部队说：“现在不需要很多人，以后再说吧！”李春凤耐心地等待着，热心地学习着战地救护技术。直到后来战争继续发展，她才被允许穿上制服。
    “当然，”她说：“部队的生活比我在医院的时候要苦些。在结核医院里，公家供给伙食服装。每月还有一千二百元薪金。现在，比较少了一些，我是为祖国的独立和统一而战，再苦些又算什么呢？男人作战，我们至少可以当看护。”
    李春凤谈起她在解放前的生活。她只有一个老母亲；租种地主几亩薄地，连马铃薯都吃不饱。“八一五”后，北朝鲜大力发展工业，她几个本家哥哥都入工厂作工，供养她的母亲，现在一天三餐，净吃大米饭。她得到国家的帮助，在看护学校毕业，成为一个技术人员。她说：“没有我们这个好祖国，我不能有今天，我有多大力量，都要贡献给她。”
    这个雄赳赳的十九岁女青年，还没有订婚。她说：“那是战后的事情。现在是战争时期。我们这时候在这里谈话，一会儿不知走到什么地方。水里火里都是要去的。”李春凤十分想念她的母亲。她再三表示。越是想母亲，越得努力工作，以便早日把战争打赢，回去看她。
    我和许多人民军的战士谈过话，发现他们都有和这两位青年相似的思想和经历。这说明了为什么朝鲜的爱国统一战争的胜利能够这样迅速地扩大与巩固起来。美国俘虏说：他们开始遇到人民军的横冲直撞的坦克，以为坦克手一定是苏联人或中国人。他们被俘以后，看到炮塔中跳出健壮的朝鲜青年，大吃一惊，都后悔自己来得太“鲁莽”了。
    在前线和后方，都涌现了无数英雄。二十六岁的分队长申永禄，在过去的抗日战争中，曾经立过七次大功，被称为战斗模范。六月二十九日，他奉命率领突击班，攻击桦川（属江原道）以南敌三三零高地。敌人以六个中队构成三道防线，在制高点上以各种火力向人民军猛烈射击。申永禄带领突击班匍匐前进，接近高地后，立即以刺刀向敌人冲击。敌人的第一道防线被冲破了，申永禄臂部也负了伤。中队长劝他下火线，他说：“我虽然负了伤，任务还没有完成呢。”他站在全队之前，继续向前进击，在他第二次负伤倒地之后，敌人的二、三防线恰恰被突破了。申永禄以前是一个翻身农民，现在他的弹伤已快痊愈了。
    阴城、利川（均在忠清北道北部）等地得以迅速解放，主要应该归功于一个无名的工兵英雄孔性洙，在这次战斗中，他有了巨大的功劳。他是一个二十六岁的农民出身的战士，很会游泳。当时骊州（在京疆道）刚刚解放，部队的任务是飞速进军，不让敌人喘息。追击部队遇到一个很大的困难；利川江的大桥被敌机炸毁了。工兵某中队接到命令：引导部队游泳渡河。孔性洙在敌机威胁下，不分昼夜地紧张工作，每小时引渡一百人。从七月三日到九日，他比普通的工兵多引渡了五千人，几乎相当半个师团的兵力。从外表看来，他也是个非常普通的战士，诚实而且谦逊。但在作战的时候，他显出了惊人的精力。
    朝鲜人民军中有千千万万这样的人，他们以自己的血，写成朝鲜革命史上空前的伟大胜利。幸福的朝鲜后世儿孙，将永远颂赞他们的祖先——这些人民英雄的不朽业绩。
