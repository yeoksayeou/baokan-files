Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The national summer grain collection work is proceeding smoothly, with most wheat-producing areas nearing completion or having completed their tasks. As of mid-August, Shanxi and the outskirts of Tianjin had completed their tasks, Hebei had completed 95.6%, Pingyuan 95.47%, the outskirts of Beijing 77.4%, Henan 93.02%, Hubei 72.05%, and northern Jiangsu slightly over 77%. Shandong started collection later, but by August 10th, it had completed 46.18%. In addition, Fujian and the two Guangdong provinces mainly grow rice, with a later harvest season, and are now stepping up collection efforts.

In this year's summer grain collection work, leading organs in various regions have emphasized implementing the collection policy and following the mass line, thereby greatly reducing the coercive commandism that existed in past collection efforts. Also, because this year's summer grain quota has been appropriately reduced and the farmers' enthusiasm for paying grain has increased, the collection work is proceeding smoothly. Some counties completed their tasks entirely within six days after the start of collection, and the grain quality was also good. The public grain stored in Henan and Hubei had generally been sun-dried two or three times. Some farmers voluntarily replaced inferior wheat with good wheat for delivery. Some farmers said: "The policy is clearly explained, the burden is lighter, and it is fair and reasonable, so we understand. We are happy to pay a little more." The masses in Hebei Province believe that "the cadres' work style has changed" and that it is "relatively fair," further increasing their production enthusiasm. The cadres have also initially learned how to handle affairs and complete tasks according to policy.

The reason why this year's summer grain collection work has generally been able to implement the policy and overcome bureaucratism and coercive commandism is mainly because of the following measures:

1.  Leading cadres took the lead in studying policies and regulations, greatly reducing the deviations that might occur in the implementation of policies. The Yishui Special District in Shandong organized district and village cadres and hired assistant collectors to study collectively, and conducted strict tests after the study was completed.

2.  Some regions inspected the autumn grain collection work from last year before the summer grain collection. During the inspection, facts were used to educate cadres to understand that those who implemented the policy and followed the mass line completed their tasks well and quickly; those who made mistakes of bureaucratism and coercive commandism suffered losses in their work. Therefore, the cadres had a clear understanding of the harm of bureaucratism and coercive commandism in their thinking, and the erroneous view of some cadres that "the task cannot be completed if the policy is implemented" was also corrected.

3.  The leading organs conducted in-depth investigations of arable land and output in advance, overcoming bureaucratic work styles. Pingyuan County in Shandong Province did not investigate output in advance, but only argued about the task from above, so that it could not be distributed for a long time. Later, after timely correction, the county magistrate and the deputy secretary of the CPC County Committee led the county's grain collection cadres to conduct on-the-spot investigations, clarifying the output, so the work was smoothly carried out.

4.  Implementing policies and carrying out criticism and self-criticism through people's representative conferences at all levels is one of the best ways to overcome bureaucratism and commandism and strengthen the ties between the government and the people in this year's summer grain collection. Responsible cadres in many counties in Pingyuan, Hebei, and Henan explained the summer grain collection policy at county-level people's representative conferences, and made self-criticisms of the shortcomings of last year's autumn grain collection work, listened to the opinions of representatives from all walks of life, and gave appropriate punishments to cadres who seriously violated the policy, thus making the summer grain collection work proceed smoothly. Yixian County and Anyang County in Pingyuan Province also made public local finances at the representative meeting, using examples to illustrate the state's public grain for production and disaster relief, so that the financial policy of "taking from the people and using for the people" was deeply understood by the representatives attending the meeting. At the same time, during the summer grain collection, local people's governments also exposed shortcomings in the work through newspapers and corrected deviations in a timely manner. The fact that some areas in the Zibo Special District of Shandong did not evaluate production according to normal years during the summer grain collection was corrected due to the exposure by the Dazhong Daily.

However, at the beginning of this year's summer grain collection, the leading organs in some areas only generally emphasized overcoming bureaucratism and coercive commandism, and did not point out to lower-level cadres specific methods on how to follow the mass line to complete the task. Therefore, the idea of "rather low than high, rather less than more" was generated among district and village cadres, unintentionally becoming the tail of backward masses. This deviation has been corrected in a timely manner after being discovered.

Some problems still exist in this year's summer grain collection work. For example, many areas have not conducted or paid attention to systematic investigation and research, so some phenomena of uneven burdens still exist. Some areas have held too many meetings and made too many arrangements, and the burden methods have changed frequently, failing to start collection in time after the summer harvest, making collection work difficult. Some areas have not taken good care of production, arousing farmers' dissatisfaction. These problems need to be addressed well in this year's autumn collection and next year's summer collection.

### 贯彻征收政策克服官僚主义命令主义  全国夏征工作顺利进行  产麦地区大部接近完成或已完成任务

　　贯彻征收政策克服官僚主义命令主义
    全国夏征工作顺利进行
    产麦地区大部接近完成或已完成任务
    【新华社十四日讯】全国夏季公粮征收工作进行顺利，产麦地区大部接近完成或已完成任务。截至八月中旬止，山西和天津郊区已完成任务，河北完成百分之九十五点六，平原完成百分之九十五点四七，北京市郊区完成百分之七十七点四，河南完成百分之九十三点零二，湖北完成百分之七十二点零五，苏北完成百分之七十七强，山东开征较迟，至八月十日止已完成百分之四十六点一八。此外，福建及两广地区多系种植水稻，收获期较晚，现正加紧征收中。
    今年夏征工作中，各地领导机关都强调贯彻征收政策与群众路线，因而大大减少了历年来征收工作中存在着的某些强迫命令作风；同时也因为今年夏季公粮已适当减轻，农民缴粮积极性的提高，征收工作进行顺利。有的县份开征后六天内即全部完成任务，而且粮质也好。河南、湖北入仓公粮一般都晒过两三遍。有的农民自动把次麦换成好麦上交。有的农民说：“政策交待清楚，负担轻了，又公平合理，心里明白，多缴点也痛快。”河北省的群众认为“干部作风变了”、“比较公平了”，生产情绪更加提高；干部也初步学会了按政策办事、完成任务的方法。
    今年夏征工作之所以一般能贯彻政策，克服官僚主义与强迫命令作风，主要是因为采取了以下几种措施：
    一、领导干部带头学习政策法令，大大减少了执行政策中可能发生的偏差。山东沂水专区曾组织区村干部和聘用的助征人员集体学习，学习完毕后进行严格测验。
    二、有些地区在夏征以前检查了去年秋征工作。在检查中间，用事实教育干部了解：凡是贯彻政策，走群众路线的，任务完成得又好又快；凡是犯了官僚主义与强迫命令的错误的，都使工作遭到损失。因此使干部在思想上对官僚主义与强迫命令的危害性有了明确的认识，某些干部认为“要贯彻政策便不能完成任务”的错误看法也得到了纠正。
    三、领导机关事先深入调查了耕地与产量，克服官僚主义作风。山东省平原县事先没有调查产量，只在上面争论任务，以致迟迟不能分配下去，后来及时加以纠正后，由县长及中共县委副书记率领全县征粮干部进行实地调查，弄清了产量，因而工作即顺利展开。
    四、通过各界人民代表会议，贯彻政策，展开批评与自我批评，这是今年夏征中克服官僚主义和命令主义，密切政府与人民联系的最好办法之一。平原、河北、河南不少县的负责干部都在县各界人民代表会议上解释夏征政策，并对去年秋征工作的缺点作了自我批评，听取了各界代表的意见，对于严重违反政策的干部给予适当处分，因而使夏征工作顺利展开。平原省邺县安阳等县并在代表会上公开地方财政，用实例说明国家公粮用于生产救灾的情况，使“取之于民，用之于民”的财政政策为与会代表深刻认识。同时，在夏征进行中，各地方人民政府还通过报纸，揭发工作中的缺点，及时纠正偏向。山东淄博专区在夏征中有的不按常年评产，即是由于大众日报的揭露而得以纠正的。
    但在今年夏征开始时，有些地区的领导机关仅一般地强调克服官僚主义与强迫命令作风，没有向下级干部指出如何走群众路线来完成任务的具体办法，因而在区村干部中产生了“宁低不高、宁少不多”的思想，有意无意成了落后群众的尾巴。这一偏向经发觉后已及时纠正。
    今年夏征工作中尚存在着一些问题。如不少地区没有或不注意系统地进行调查研究，因此负担上某些畸轻畸重现象依然存在。有的地区开会布置太多，负担办法朝令夕改，没有在夏收后及时开征，使征收工作发生困难。有的地区则没有很好照顾生产，引起农民的不满。这些问题有待今年秋征与明年夏征时很好地注意解决。
