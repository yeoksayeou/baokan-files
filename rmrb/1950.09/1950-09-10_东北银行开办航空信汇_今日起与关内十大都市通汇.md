    Remitting to Ten Major Cities in Guannei Starting Today
    [Benbao Shenyang News] In view of the fact that the Civil Aviation Company has started flights, in order to ensure that remittances arrive quickly, the Northeast Bank has decided to open air mail transfer services to ten major cities in Guannei (inside the Shanhaiguan Pass) starting from September 10. These cities are Taiyuan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, and Dihua. The method is that each remitting bank of the Northeast Bank (limited to those remitting to Guannei) will send the mail transfer documents to the Shanhaiguan Joint Office of the People's Bank of China Northeast Bank via ordinary mail for transfer. The Shanhaiguan Joint Office will then forward them to the paying bank in Guannei via airmail. In addition to the regular mail transfer fee and handling fee, an additional airmail fee of 30,000 Northeast currency will be charged for air mail transfers.
