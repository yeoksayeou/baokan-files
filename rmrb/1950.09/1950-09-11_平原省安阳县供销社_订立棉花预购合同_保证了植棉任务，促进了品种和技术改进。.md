Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Anyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingyuan Province has signed "pre-purchase contracts" for cotton with farmers this year, guaranteeing the completion of the cotton planting task and the supply of industrial raw materials.

This spring, Anyang County accepted the task assigned by higher authorities to plant 300,000 mu of cotton to supply industrial raw materials. Because the state-owned trading company purchased cotton relatively late in the county's rural areas last year, and cotton prices were lowered by private merchants, some cotton farmers suffered some losses. This caused cotton farmers to worry about the sales channels and prices of cotton this year, which made the work of promoting cotton planting more difficult. Under such circumstances, the county's supply and marketing cooperative immediately signed pre-purchase contracts with district and village cooperatives, mutual aid groups, etc., to guarantee the sales channels for cotton after the autumn harvest, and to guarantee the exchange of one jin of cotton for eight jin or more of millet. After this type of contract was widely promoted in various villages, the cotton planting movement was enthusiastically launched. In total, the county planted more than 364,000 mu of cotton, exceeding the original task by more than 60,000 mu, more than double the 160,000 mu planted last year.

Due to the stipulations in the pre-purchase contract regarding cotton quality and specifications, farmers have also improved in variety selection and cotton planting techniques.

After the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company learned that the county's supply and marketing cooperative signed pre-purchase contracts with farmers, it allocated 3.1 million jin of grain through the cooperative to cotton farmers to solve the difficulties of cotton farmers in terms of production tools, fertilizers, food, etc. The county's supply and marketing cooperative also signed contracts with small handicraftsmen (blacksmiths and carpenters) scattered in various villages to manufacture agricultural tools with 150,000 jin of agricultural tool loans from the People's Bank, and then lent the finished products to farmers. In this way, the special funds for agricultural loans from the bank were guaranteed to be used for their designated purpose, and farmers were able to borrow higher-quality agricultural tools.

Recently, the county's supply and marketing cooperative also introduced district and village cooperatives and mutual aid groups to sign contracts with the Zizhen and Wangjialin coal mines in the county for the pre-purchase of 8 million jin of coal. On the one hand, it found sales channels for coal mine production, and on the other hand, it enabled farmers to obtain coal in a timely manner.

In order to promote this method of signing pre-purchase contracts, the cooperative held a county-wide representative meeting of cooperatives. At the meeting, 116 village and community representatives comprehensively investigated the production characteristics of various places in the county and studied methods of mutual exchange of products.

　　平原省安阳县供销社
    订立棉花预购合同
    保证了植棉任务，促进了品种和技术改进。
    【新华社六日讯】平原省安阳县供销合作社，今年与农民订立棉花的“预购合同”，保证了植棉任务的完成和工业原料的供应。
    今年春天，安阳县接受了上级给予的为供给工业原料而种植三十万亩棉花的任务。由于去年国营贸易公司在该县农村中收购棉花较迟，棉价为私商压低，部分棉农利益曾受到一些损失，因而使棉农对于今年棉花的销路和价格问题发生了顾虑，使推广植棉的工作增加了困难。在这样的情况下，该县供销社当即与区、村合作社、互助组等订立了预购合同，保证秋收后棉花的销路，并保证以八斤以上的小米换一斤棉花。当这种合同在各村普遍推行后，植棉运动就热烈开展起来。总计全县植棉三十六万四千余亩，超过原定任务六万余亩，达去年植棉十六万亩的一倍以上。
    由于预购合同对于棉花质量，规格均有规定，农民在品种选择和植棉技术上也有了改进。
    国营花纱布公司在该县供销社与农民订立预购合同后，即拨出粮食三百一十万斤通过合作社发给棉农，以解决棉农生产工具、肥料、食粮等的困难。该县供销社又将人民银行十五万斤的农具贷粮与分散在各村的小手工业者（铁匠、木匠）订立制造农具合同，然后将成品转贷给农民。这样，既保证了银行农贷的专款专用，又使农民贷到了质量较高的农具。
    该县供销社最近又介绍各区、村合作社和互助组与该县子针、王家林两煤矿订立了预购八百万斤煤的合同，一方面为煤矿生产找到了销路，另一方面又使农民能适时地得到用煤。
    该社为了推广这种订立预购合同的办法，曾召开一次全县合作社代表会议。会上一百一十六个村社代表全面地调查该县各地的生产特点，研究了产品互相交换的办法。
