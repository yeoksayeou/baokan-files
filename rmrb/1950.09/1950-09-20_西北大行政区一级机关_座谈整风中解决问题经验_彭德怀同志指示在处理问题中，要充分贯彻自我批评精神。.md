　　Northwest Great Administrative Region First-Level Organs
    Experience in Solving Problems During Rectification
    Comrade Peng Dehuai Instructs to Fully Implement the Spirit of Self-Criticism in Handling Problems

    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Xi'an Mass Daily News: On September 6th, the Northwest Region First-Level Organs General Study Committee convened a symposium of responsible comrades from various organs on the experience of the second phase of rectification. Comrade Peng Dehuai, First Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, personally presided over the meeting. Responsible comrades from organs such as the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Supervisory Committee, focused on introducing the methods and experiences of their respective organs in solving problems. The most fundamental of these was: to conduct systematic and in-depth inspections based on the completion of major work tasks and the implementation of major policies of their departments, to identify the problems in ideology, work style, and systems, and then to formulate improvement measures. This method has had a significant effect. Regarding the conclusion of the second phase of rectification and the commencement of the third phase, the following steps will generally be taken: (1) During the second phase, each organ will concentrate its efforts, seize the time, and solve several important problems related to the implementation of basic policies and major work tasks, in order to improve leadership thinking, improve work style, and formulate specific methods for improving work. This phase will not exceed September 20th. (2) Problems not resolved in the second phase will be resolved in the third phase. Those concerning individuals will be reviewed by the individuals themselves; those involving several organs that cannot be resolved by one organ will be resolved by convening symposiums according to the system (such as the Finance Committee system, the Culture Committee system, etc.) to coordinate; major problems that cannot be resolved by this system or that concern the entire Northwest region will finally be reviewed and resolved by the Northwest Bureau. Comrade Peng Dehuai spoke at the meeting, pointing out that since the rectification began, various organs have exposed many problems, and some organs have achieved certain results. However, this has not yet reached the desired level. This is mainly because the inspection work from top to bottom by the leadership has not been sufficient. Some leading comrades still lack the necessary criticism and self-criticism. With the spirit of self-criticism, Comrade Peng Dehuai reviewed his insufficient supervision and inspection of the rectification study at the first-level organs in the Northwest Region. He demanded that responsible comrades of various departments strictly examine themselves with a spirit of responsibility to the people's cause. Regarding how to solve problems, Comrade Peng Dehuai pointed out: It is most fundamental to solve problems practically and realistically, starting from reality. When solving problems, they must be analyzed, synthesized, compared, and repeatedly discussed before being dealt with. In viewing and handling problems, the spirit of criticism and self-criticism must be fully implemented. Finally, various necessary systems and detailed rules for handling affairs must be formulated to ensure that work is effectively improved.

　　西北大行政区一级机关
    座谈整风中解决问题经验
    彭德怀同志指示在处理问题中，要充分贯彻自我批评精神。
    【本报讯】据西安群众日报消息：九月六日，西北区一级机关总学委召集各机关负责同志座谈整风第二阶段经验。自中共中央西北局第一书记彭德怀同志亲自主持。民政部、水利部、农林部、监察委员会等机关负责同志，着重的介绍了本机关解决问题的方法及经验，其中最基本的是：根据本部门完成主要工作任务和执行主要政策情况，进行系统深入的检查，找出其属于思想、作风、制度上的毛病，从而订出改进的办法。这种办法的效果是较大的。关于结束整风第二阶段及开始第三阶段，将大体采取下列步骤：（一）在第二阶段中，各机关集中力量，抓紧时间，解决几个有关基本政策及主要工作任务之执行的重要问题，以提高领导思想，改善工作作风，并订出改进工作的具体办法。此一阶段将不超过九月二十日。（二）第二阶段所没有解决的问题，在第三阶段中解决。其中属于个人的，将由个人作检讨；牵连几个机关而一个机关不能解决者，将按系统（如财委系统、文委系统等）召开座谈会，协同进行解决；本系统不能解决或有关整个西北全区的重大问题，最后由西北局作总的检讨、解决。彭德怀同志在会上讲话，他指出：此次整风以来，各机关暴露了不少问题，某些机关并收到了一定的成绩。但还没有达到应有的程度。这主要是由于领导上自上而下的检查工作做得不够。某些领导同志还缺乏应有的批评与自我批评。彭德怀同志以自我批评的精神，检讨了自己对西北区一级的整风学习督促检查不够。他要求各部门负责同志以对人民事业负责的精神，严格的检查自己。关于如何解决问题，彭德怀同志指出：要从实际出发，实事求是的解决问题。这是最基本的一条。解决时要经过分析、综合、比较、反复讨论，然后处理。在看问题、处理问题中，要充分贯彻批评与自我批评的精神。最后，要订出各种必要的制度、办事细则，以保证切实的改进工作。
