　　Mao Zedong Locomotive
   (Serialized novella)
    By Ding Kexin, Qingying, Illustrated by Zhuang Yan
  Thirty-Three. We Follow the Locomotive Wherever It Goes
    After the success of the cyclical operation system, the old hero was promoted to instructor driver. He couldn't bear to leave the "Mao Zedong Locomotive," especially the comrades and Guo Shude; Guo Shude and the others also couldn't bear to see the old hero leave. But the superiors' orders were paramount, so he had to go.

    Coincidentally, just a week after the old hero left, Guo Shude received an order for the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" to go through the pass.

    He was happy, anxious, and scared: happy because going through the pass to establish a banner was a glorious task, and he could learn from the workers inside the pass; anxious because the old hero had left the locomotive and couldn't lead everyone through the pass; scared that everyone had family commitments and wouldn't want to leave the Northeast. Moreover, Yang Daofang had joined the Railway Corps and gone south, and Sun Changxin was on sick leave and off the locomotive, so there weren't enough people.

    What to do?

    Representative Zhang said to him:

    "First, you must mobilize the old hero to go through the pass. He has a large family and faces difficulties in life. Tell him that the administration and the trade union will definitely take care of him. All comrades who go through the pass will be taken care of if they have difficulties."

    "I want to mobilize the others first before mobilizing the old hero," Guo Shude said. "Moreover, the task of admitting the old hero into the Party has not yet been completed."

    "The issue of Party membership can be discussed after the mobilization work is done. My opinion is that after the mobilization work is done, you should hold three meetings: the first meeting to determine the work plan; the second meeting to conduct a review and summary of past work and personal actions; and the third meeting to openly discuss Party membership. The last meeting should be even better, and you should do more to inspire them, and maybe it will mature while discussing it. Because the working class is always better than other classes. Moreover, this time is very different, it is a glorious thing to go through the pass to establish a locomotive banner."

    Guo Shude was much happier now, more relaxed, and had an idea and a plan. He also proposed that since there were not enough people now, they should first add two Party member apprentice stokers.

    "That is also your responsibility to mobilize. After you have mobilized them, we will issue an order to transfer them," Representative Zhang said.

    Guo Shude came out and first mobilized Wang Qingquan, the Party member apprentice stoker; Wang Qingquan was very excited and had no problems. The two also discussed: first, they would separately mobilize Yue Shangwu and Zhao Haisheng, and then hold a group meeting on the locomotive to solicit everyone's opinions. Yue Shangwu was originally a decorator, but he was willing to learn all-around skills, lower his salary to learn stoking (stoker), and then learn driving (driver). Zhao Haisheng was an apprentice stoker and joined the Party not long after Harbin was liberated, and was very willing to go through the pass.

    At the group meeting, Shang Baoheng first asked Guo Shude if he was going.

    Guo Shude said:

    "Of course I'm going!"

    He then asked Wang Qingquan, who said:

    "I'll go wherever you go, don't think I have a wife, she can't tie me down!"

    Old Shang said:

    "Since you are all going, I have no problem."

    Hu Chundong and Little Zhu also said:

    "'Wherever the Mao Zedong Locomotive goes, we'll follow it."

    The remaining one was Zheng Dugong.

    Everyone estimated that he would not want to leave home and that it might be a problem. Unexpectedly, he was more decisive than anyone else:

    "I'll go even if no one else does!"

    Guo Shude asked him why he was so determined. He said:

    "People change, you can't see people as fixed. In the past, I thought that whoever came was just working and eating, eating and working, but now I know that's not the case. Besides, Beijing and Tianjin have already been liberated, and Nanjing and Shanghai will be liberated soon, I can't always shrink back! Besides, my hometown is in Jinan, I couldn't go home in the past, now that I'm going through the pass, I can move my family back to my old home in Jinan."

    Someone laughed at him:

    "You always say that people only care about their own interests, so it turns out that you are also 'personal interests first'!"

    Old Shang joked:

    "Old Sage, this must be a good idea from your wife. Send your grandfather, mother, younger brother, and younger sister all back home, and leave her, Huadiu, alone to enjoy the good life with you, am I right?..."

    Old Zheng's face was already red, and Old Shang's words made him even more embarrassed, so he said to Old Shang:

    "Don't talk nonsense, we're not on the same wavelength. To be honest with you, I've suffered a lot from your backwardness!"

    Seeing that things were not good, Guo Shude quickly advised:

    "What Old Zheng just said was very frank, and frankness is good, some comrades can't compare to him in this regard, so everyone shouldn't make fun of him. But Old Shang is just joking, jokes shouldn't be taken seriously, let's talk about our business."

    Old Zheng took the opportunity to say something conciliatory, he said:

    "What I just said frankly, if everyone thinks it's not right, I'll take back what I said about moving, I am determined to go through the pass."

    Guo Shude said:

    "That's very good. I have another suggestion, let's invite the old hero back to the locomotive! The old hero has experience and skills, and is also a veteran driver, if he comes back, wouldn't it be even better for us to go through the pass with the original crew?"

    As soon as this was mentioned, there were many opinions:

    Half of the people estimated that the old hero would not go, he had a large family and they were holding him back; half of the people thought he would go, because since Chief Guo came on the locomotive, the old hero's thinking had developed a lot, and when he was transferred, he was originally unwilling to leave. In the end, everyone agreed to let Chief Guo mobilize him. Coincidentally, before the meeting was over, the old hero came to see everyone! (Attached image)

　　毛泽东号
   （中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影  作  庄言  插图
  三十三、车到哪里跟到哪里
    循环运转制又试验成功之后，老英雄升任了指导司机。他舍不得离开“毛泽东号”，尤其舍不得离开大伙儿和郭树德；郭树德和大伙儿也都舍不得老英雄走。可是上级的命令，工作要紧，只好走了。
    可巧，老英雄刚离开一星期，郭树德就接到要“毛泽东号”进关的命令。
    他又是喜，又是急，又是怕：喜的是要进关树立旗帜，这任务很光荣，还能向关内工友学习；急的是老英雄离了车，不能带领大家进关；怕的是大家有家庭观念，不愿意离开东北。又赶上杨道芳参加铁道兵团南下了，孙长信有病请假下了车，人也不够。
    这怎么办？
    张代表对他说：
    “第一，你先要去动员老英雄进关。他家里人口多，生活上有困难，告诉他行政上和工会一定要照顾他。凡是进关的同志，有困难都要照顾。”
    “我想先动员好了别人再动员老英雄。”郭树德说：“而且，吸收老英雄入党的任务还没有完成。”
    “吸收入党的问题，把动员工作做好以后再说。我的意见，动员工作做好以后，你们要开三个会：第一个会定工作计划；第二个会把过去工作和个人自己做个检讨和总结；第三个会公开酝酿入党。末了一个会更要开得好些，你多做些启发工作，说不定一面酝酿一面就成熟了。因为工人阶级总是比别的阶级好。何况这次又大大不同，是光荣进关去树立机车旗帜。”
    郭树德这时愉快多了，轻松多了，有了主意也有了办法。他又提出现在人员不够，先增加两个党员司炉。
    “这个也由你负责去动员，动员好了我们下命令调。”张代表说。
    郭树德出来就先把党员学习司炉王清权动员好；王清权非常兴奋，什么问题也没有。两个人并且商议好：先分头去动员岳尚武和赵海盛，然后车上再开小组会征求大家的意见。岳尚武原是装修工，但是他愿意学习全面技术，降低工资去学烧火（司炉），再学开车（司机）。赵海盛是学习司炉，哈尔滨解放不久就入党，非常乐意进关。
    小组会上，商宝恒先问郭树德去不去？
    郭树德说：
    “当然去！”
    他又问王清权，王清权说：
    “到哪里我也去，别看有媳妇，拴不住！”
    老商说：
    “既然你们都去，我更没问题。”
    胡春东和小朱也都说：
    “‘毛泽东号’开到哪里，咱跟到哪里。”
    剩下的就是郑笃恭了。
    大家估计他不愿离开家，恐怕成问题。没想到他比谁也干脆：
    “谁不去我也去！”
    郭树德问他为什么这样坚决？他说：
    “人是变化的，不能把人看死了。过去我认定谁来也是干活吃饭，吃饭干活，现在知道不是那么回事了。再说，北京、天津都已经解放了，南京、上海也快要解放，我不能老往后缩呀！再说，我的老家在济南，过去有家回不去，现在进了关，可以把家里人搬回济南老家去了。”
    有人就笑他：
    “你成天说人家只顾个人利益，闹半天你也是个人利益第一呀！”
    老商就开玩笑：
    “老圣人，这准是你媳妇给你出的好主意。把你祖父、母亲、弟弟妹妹都送回家去，剩她花丢丢一个人好跟你享清福，你说对不对？……”
    老郑本来已经红了脸，老商一说更加挂不住了，就对老商说道：
    “你不要胡扯，咱俩不过电。老实对你说，我吃你落后的亏吃大了！”
    郭树德一见不好，就赶紧劝解说：
    “老郑刚才说的很坦白，坦白是很好的，这一点有些同志比不上他，因此大家更不该取笑。不过老商也只是说着玩，玩笑不能当真，说咱们的正事吧。”
    老郑就趁势说了句圆脸的话，他说：
    “刚才是我坦白说的，大家认为不对头，我把搬家的话收回，进关我是坚决的。”
    郭树德说：
    “这就很好。我再提个意见，咱们把老英雄请回车来吧！老英雄有经验有技术，又是老司机长，他要回来，咱们原班进关岂不更好？”
    这一提，人们的意见就多了：
    有一半人估计老英雄不会去，他家人口多，把他拖住了；有一半人认为他会去，因为自从郭大车上车以后，老英雄思想上开展多了，临调走的时候，他本来就不愿意离开。最后大家同意让郭大车去动员他。正巧，会还没散，老英雄找大家来了！（附图片）
