Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: Among the representatives at this National Congress of Combat Heroes are many engineer heroes, blasting heroes, artillery heroes, tank heroes, and excellent sharpshooters. This vividly illustrates that commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army have learned to master the combat skills of various arms of service through long and arduous battles.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the early stages of the Liberation War, when the People's Liberation Army did not have enough heavy weapons, engineer demolition played a significant role in siege warfare. Chai Xuejiu, a blasting hero of the Second Field Army and now the battalion commander of an engineer battalion, created various demolition weapons in his thirteen years of struggle. He invented more than ten kinds of demolition weapons and engineering equipment. In 1948, he started an engineering training class, training nearly two thousand engineers in four years, many of whom became outstanding blasting heroes and bridge-building heroes. He was wounded seven times. His right arm was severed in 1942 during the War of Resistance Against Japan when he was explaining the structure of a hand grenade to militiamen and it accidentally exploded. Although he only has one arm left, this one-armed hero is even braver and more active than before. When building a large bridge near Qujiang, he insisted on working for three days and four nights, and fainted on the bridge. After waking up, he continued to insist on working as usual. Zhang Ba, a special-class blasting hero of the First Field Army, has long been famous throughout the army. In 1946, when the People's Liberation Army attacked Shuoxian, he blew up two city gates. In the battle of Xiaoyi City, his blasting team blew open the south gate, allowing the assault team to successfully rush into the city. Thanks to his research, creation, and the cultivation and promotion by army leaders, the blasting movement became a mass movement in his division.

Many commanders and fighters gained the reputation of "god of artillery" during the Liberation War. Bai Bingwu, a famous artilleryman in the Northwest Military Region, achieved a hit rate of over 95% in three years of combat. He was originally a rifleman, but after becoming an artilleryman, he quickly mastered artillery techniques because he was able to study diligently and practice hard. Now he is also diligently studying and practicing to master tank combat techniques. Cui Yongfeng, the company commander of an artillery company in the Central South Military Region, once achieved the record of hitting ten targets with ten shells, repelling an enemy battalion in the Liujiazi battle on the outskirts of Siping Street. In the battle of the Third Siping, he fired seven shells in a row at the Red Building Railway Station, hitting every one of them, and all seven shells went through the same hole. This miracle caused a sensation throughout the army. The company led by Li Qiyuan, an artillery hero of a unit in the North China Military Region, experienced more than forty battles, large and small, with a hit rate of 93%.

The People's Liberation Army only established mechanized units in recent years, but many excellent tankers have already emerged. Shen Xu of the Third Field Army is one of them. On the Mid-Autumn Festival night of 1948, the young People's Tank Force first showed its skills in the attack on Jinan. Shen Xu and other tank soldiers completed the task of destroying enemy fortifications and covering the infantry's advance. In another battle, Shen Xu's tank was subjected to fierce attacks by enemy ground artillery and nine enemy aircraft. He said to his comrades, "This tank was given to us by the Party and the people. As long as we are here, it will be here." They persisted in fighting in the tank for two days and one night, and safely drove the tank back to the position. In the Huaihai Campaign, the young tank force, including Shen Xu's "Zhu De" tank, exerted great power. When Shen Xu first became a soldier in the People's Tank Force, he did not understand this modern weapon, but he humbly learned from the liberated tank soldiers, studied sleeplessly, and finally became familiar with the complex parts and became an excellent tank shooter. Now he is a commander of a tank company.

Many army commanders and fighters who made meritorious service in the Liberation War quickly mastered this modern technology after joining the navy and air force, and have already created many heroic deeds.

### 人民解放军各种兵种的英雄们

　　人民解放军各种兵种的英雄们
    【新华社二十四日讯】这次全国战斗英雄代表会议的代表们中，有很多工兵英雄、爆炸英雄、炮兵英雄、坦克英雄和优秀的射击手。这是人民解放军指战员们在长期艰苦战斗中学会掌握各种兵种战斗技术的生动说明。
    在抗日战争中和解放战争初期，人民解放军还没有足够的重武器时，工兵爆破在攻坚战中起了很大的作用。第二野战军的爆破英雄、现为某部工兵营长的柴学久，在他十三年的斗争生活中，创造了各种的爆破火器。他发明创造出来的爆破火器和工兵器材有十多种。在一九四八年，他开办了工兵训练班，四年当中训练出了近两千名的工兵，其中有不少成了出色的爆破英雄和架桥英雄。他负过七次伤，他的右臂是在一九四二年抗日战争中给民兵讲解手榴弹的构造时不慎被爆炸断的。他虽然只剩一只手，但这位独臂英雄却比以前更勇敢、更积极。在建筑曲江附近某大桥时，他坚持了三天四夜的工作，因而晕倒在桥上，苏醒过来后，他仍照样坚持工作。第一野战军的特等爆炸英雄张八的威名早已传遍了全军。一九四六年人民解放军攻打朔县时，两道城门被他炸得粉碎。在孝义城的战斗中，他的爆炸组炸开了南门，使突击队顺利冲进城去。由于他的研究创造和军队领导方面的培养推广，爆炸运动成了他所属的那一师的群众性的运动。
    许多指战员在解放战争中获得了“神炮手”的称誉。西北军区的著名炮手白炳武在三年的战斗中射击命中率达百分之九十五以上。他原来是一个步枪手，在转为炮兵以后，因为能够勤学苦练，便很快地掌握了炮兵的技术。现在他又为掌握战车战斗技术在勤学苦练中。中南军区某炮兵连的连长崔永峰，在四平街外围六家子战斗中曾创十发炮弹发发命中，打退敌人一个营的战绩。在三打四平的战斗中，他向红楼车站连发七发炮弹，发发命中，而且七发炮弹都是从一个炮眼中穿进去的。这一奇迹曾轰动了全军。华北军区某部炮兵英雄李启元领导的连队，经历了四十多次大小战斗，命中率达百分之九十三。
    人民解放军是在最近几年才建立机械化部队的，但已经出现了不少的优秀坦克手。第三野战军的沈许就是其中的一个。一九四八年的中秋之夜，年青的人民坦克部队在攻击济南的战斗中初显身手。沈许和其他坦克战士们一起，完成了摧毁敌人工事、掩护步兵前进的任务。在另一次战斗中，沈许的坦克遭到敌人地面炮火和九架敌机的猛攻。他对自己的战友们说：“这辆坦克是党和人民交给我们的，只要有我们在，就要有它在。”他们在坦克里坚持了两天一夜的战斗，把坦克安然开回阵地。淮海战役中，年轻的坦克部队包括沈许的“朱德号”坦克在内发挥了很大的威力。沈许在开始成为人民坦克部队的战士时，是不懂得这种现代化的兵器的，但他虚心地向解放过来的坦克手学习，通宵不眠地学习，终于熟悉了复杂的机件，成为了一位优秀的坦克射击手。现在他已是一个坦克连队的指挥员了。
    很多在解放战争中立了功的陆军指战员们，在他们参加到海军、空军部队后，也很快地掌握了这种现代化的技术，并且已经创造了不少的英雄事迹。
