　　Huang Zhongmin, Who Persisted in Fighting Behind Enemy Lines

From the Zhejiang South Guerrilla Column, which persisted in fighting behind enemy lines for fourteen years, and from this people's hero, we see the invincible power of the people.

From 1935, when the Red Army went north to resist Japan, until 1949, when all of the Zhejiang mainland was liberated, the Zhejiang South Guerrilla Column, which persisted behind enemy lines for fourteen years, like the People's Liberation Army all over the country, produced many heroic models and people's meritorious servants in the struggle against the enemy. Huang Zhongmin, a combat hero representative of the Zhejiang Military Region, is one of them.

Under the most difficult circumstances, Comrade Huang Zhongmin resolutely fought the enemy. In April 1942, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's "encirclement and suppression" of the Zhejiang South Guerrilla Team began. The Jiufeng Mountain, Yeshan Mountain, Linghou Mountain, Nantian and other mountainous areas where the guerrillas frequently operated were all occupied by the enemy. Tens of thousands of people were massacred. Huang Zhongmin's father and brother both participated in revolutionary work and were also captured and killed by the enemy. At this time, villages with more than 30 households all built bunkers. Small villages of three to five families were either burned down or forced to move away from the mountainous areas. The activities of the guerrillas suffered unprecedented difficulties, and they could only transfer and operate on the mountaintops every day. However, the people were not intimidated and often tried every possible means to send intelligence and food to support the guerrillas at the risk of their lives. In 1943, a county party secretary betrayed the secret that the guerrillas had moved to the deep mountains on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian, and the Chiang bandit army's "encirclement and suppression" was pressing closer step by step. Enemy plainclothes men frequently appeared around the mountains where they operated. As soon as they discovered the guerrillas, they would attack regardless of day or night. Food was cut off, and they ate sweet potatoes and wild grass. Later, they couldn't even eat sweet potatoes and wild grass. They only had one set of clothes, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter. They used thatch instead of cotton quilts, and the houses were built by themselves with thatch. It was okay on sunny days, but they had to endure the rain on rainy days. Sometimes, even such a place had to be moved several times a night. During the most intense period of the struggle, they couldn't even make smoke when cooking during the day, because the enemy would surround them as soon as they detected smoke. In such a severe struggle environment, some individual comrades wavered. At that time, Huang Zhongmin was the squad leader and secretary of the county party committee's agency branch. He patiently helped and educated them and actively led the struggle. He said: "We are the oppressed people. If we can unite as one, we can persevere to the end and achieve victory." The guerrillas finally persevered and won.

In July 1947, under the call of "expanding the guerrilla areas, attacking small groups of enemies, expanding our own troops, intercepting enemy transportation lines, and cooperating with the frontal battlefield operations," Huang Zhongmin was ordered to take two squads (20 people, he was the squad leader) to operate in the area bordering Qingtian, Jingning, and Lishui, and was responsible for opening up transportation lines to Longquan and Qingyuan, as well as contact with the guerrillas of the Seventh Sub-district. Under the guidance of the correct policy of the Party, he opened up five or six townships as guerrilla base areas, destroyed the strongholds of Xiaoshun and Zhangcun, eliminated more than 50 enemies, seized more than 50 guns, and did not suffer a single casualty himself. Instead, he expanded to three squads, more than 30 people, and cooperated with the detachment and county brigade to open up hundreds of miles of transportation lines. When the Zhejiang South Column was officially established, he was transferred to be the company commander of the Third Company.

Inspired by the great victory of the Huaihai Campaign, the Zhejiang South Guerrilla Column was determined to capture Taishun County. Before the battle, he led the squad and platoon cadres to personally scout the terrain. After returning, he held a military democracy meeting (it was an extraordinary thing to hold such a meeting in the guerrilla team), explained the situation, and asked everyone to come up with ideas to solve the soldiers' concerns about attacking the city and boost their confidence. When the battle started, he led two assault squads, braving enemy fire, to be the first to break through the West Gate, capture the bunker, and eliminate more than 30 enemies. He then continued to cooperate with friendly neighboring units to capture the bandit county government, police station, and radio station, capturing more than 80 enemies and seizing more than 100 guns.

In order to annihilate the reinforcing enemy, Huang Zhongmin was ordered to take his Third Company to serve as the outpost, which was a serious combat mission. He decided to use sudden attack tactics to eliminate the enemy. As soon as the troops entered Qipoling, the front line opened fire. The enemy was using superior forces to seize a main position, and the situation was very critical. Huang Zhongmin took the initiative to lead his troops to quickly seize the main position, repelled two enemy charges, and compressed the enemy into a small position, simply and completely annihilating an entire battalion of the Chiang bandit Zhejiang Security Second Regiment, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 400 enemies, and seizing many light and heavy machine guns, 60 mortars, and rifles, greatly improving the guerrillas' equipment. In this battle, Huang Zhongmin's resourceful and decisive command played a decisive role. The headquarters and political department of the Zhejiang South Guerrilla Column specially awarded Huang Zhongmin and his Third Company a red flag, and all the cadres and soldiers of the company also agreed to award him a merit.

After the Zhejiang South Guerrilla Column and the People's Liberation Army liberating the Zhejiang mainland victoriously joined forces, Huang Zhongmin was transferred to be the battalion commander of a certain battalion of the Zhejiang Military Region. Huang Zhongmin has since taken on the serious task of suppressing bandits. In bandit suppression, he went deep into the grassroots level with arduous efforts and conscientiously implemented policies and disciplines. In one four-month period of bandit suppression, his troops captured more than 300 bandits.

Comrade Huang Zhongmin was born into a poor revolutionary family, worked as an apprentice, and joined the Communist Youth League at the age of twelve. He is now a member of the Communist Party.

　　坚持敌后斗争的黄忠民
    从坚持十四年敌后斗争的浙南游击纵队里，从这一位人民英雄的身上，使我们看见了人民的不可战胜的力量。
    自一九三五年红军北上抗日起，到一九四九年浙江大陆全部解放止，十四年来坚持敌后的浙南游击纵队，和全国各地的人民解放军一样，在和敌人斗争中出现了不少的英雄模范和人民功臣，浙江军区的战斗英雄代表黄忠民就是其中的一个。
    在最艰苦的情况下，黄忠民同志坚定不移地和敌人斗争。一九四二年四月，蒋匪军对浙南游击队的“围剿”开始了。游击队经常活动的浙南九风山、叶山、岭后山、南田等山区都被敌人占领了。成千成万的人民被屠杀了。黄忠民的父亲和哥哥都参加革命工作，也被敌人捕去杀了。这时，三十户以上的村庄都筑起了碉堡，三、五家的小村庄，都被烧的烧，被逼搬离山区的搬离了。游击队的活动，遭受了空前未有的困难，每天只能在山顶上转移活动。但是人民并没有被吓倒，仍旧经常的想尽各种办法，冒着生命的危险送情报、送粮食接济游击队。一九四三年一个县委书记叛变，游击队转移到浙闽交界深山里去的秘密泄露了，蒋匪军的“围剿”步步紧逼上来。敌人的便衣，经常出没在他们活动的山头前后左右，只要一发现游击队，不管白天黑夜，就跟着打上来。粮食断绝了，吃地瓜（蕃薯）、野草，后来就连地瓜、野草也吃不上了。穿衣服不分春夏秋冬，只有一套，没有棉被就用茅草盖，房子是自己用茅草搭成的，晴天还可，雨天只有挨淋。有时就连这样的一个处所，也常常一夜移动好几次。斗争到最紧张的时候，白天连烧饭的烟都不能冒，敌人一发觉烟火就包围上来。在这样的严重的斗争环境里，个别同志动摇了，那时黄忠民是班长兼县委机关支部书记，他耐心的帮助教育他们，积极领导斗争。他说：“我们是被压迫的人，能团结成一条心，这就能坚持到底取得胜利。”游击队终于胜利的坚持下来了。
    一九四七年七月，在“扩大游击区，打击小股敌人，扩大自己队伍，截击敌人运输线，配合正面战场作战”的号召下，黄忠民奉命带两个班（二十人，他是班长），深入到青（田）景（宁）丽（水）交界处活动，并负责打通到龙泉和庆元以及与七分区游击队联系的交通线。在党的正确方针指导下，他开辟了五、六个乡的游击根据地，打掉了小顺、章村的据点，消灭了五十多个敌人，缴了五十多支枪，自己没有一个伤亡，反而扩大到三个班，三十多人，并配合支队、县大队打通了几百里的交通线。浙南纵队正式成立时，他调任三连连长。
    在淮海战役伟大胜利的鼓舞下，浙南游击纵队下了决心攻取泰顺县。战斗发起前，他带领班排干部，亲自去看地形，回来后召开了军事民主会议（在游击队开这样会是一件了不起的事）说明情况，由大家想办法，出主意，解决战士中攻城顾虑，提高了信心。战斗发起，他带领两个突击班，冒着敌人炮火，最先突破西门，攻下碉堡，解决了三十多敌人。又继续配合友邻部队，打下匪县政府、警察局、电台，俘虏了八十多个敌人，缴枪一百多枝。
    为了歼灭来援的敌人，黄忠民奉命带他的三连，担任前哨，这是一个严重的战斗任务。他决定用突然攻击的战术，来消灭敌人。部队刚进了七坡岭，前面就打响了。敌人正以优势兵力，夺取一个主阵地，情形非常危急，黄忠民就主动的带领部队，迅速的抢占了主阵地，打垮了敌人两次冲锋，将敌人压缩到一个狭小的阵地里，干脆彻底的全部歼灭了蒋匪浙江保安第二团一个营，打死打伤和俘虏敌人四百多个，缴到了许多轻重机枪、六零炮和步枪，使游击队一切装备大为改善。这一次战斗中，黄忠民机智果敢的指挥，起了决定性的作用，浙南游击纵队的司令部政治部特地奖给黄忠民和他的三连一面红旗，全连干部战士也一起通过要给他记功。
    浙南游击纵队和解放浙江大陆的人民解放军胜利会师后，黄忠民调任浙江军区某营营长。黄忠民从此又担负起剿匪的严重任务。剿匪中他艰苦深入，并认真执行政策纪律。在一次四个月的剿匪期中，他的部队俘虏了三百多个土匪。
    黄忠民同志出身于一个贫苦的革命家庭，曾做过学徒，从十二岁起就参加了共产主义青年团，现在是共产党员。
