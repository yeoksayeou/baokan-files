Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 6th. The workers and fishermen who were killed and wounded in the U.S. aircraft strafing on August 27th and 29th have received proper condolences and heartfelt sympathy from the local people's governments.

　　After the Andong Provincial People's Government buried the remains of Sun Zilin, Wang Guanzhong, Li Xiuguo, and Sun Yugui, who died from severe injuries after being killed at Andong Airport, it allocated 20 million Northeast currency (equivalent to 6,000 catties of grain) to comfort the families of the deceased. The district and village people's governments in the area have also taken care of the families of the deceased in various ways. The People's Government of the Wulongbei District of Andong City and the factories, institutions, schools, stations and other units stationed in Wulongbei Village raised a total of 14 million yuan to comfort the families of Sun Zilin and Wang Guanzhong. The village people's government decided to allocate a part of the public land for the families of the deceased to cultivate, and provide cultivation on their behalf. This decision will be implemented after it is approved by the village people's congress. The family of Sun Yugui has also received funds from the Beijing District People's Government of Andong County, and the local villagers have provided firewood and water.

　　The remains of the three fishermen, Wu Xichun, Dong Jingui, and Liu Fuzhou, who died on the river surface in Gulouzi Village, have been properly buried by the local district and village people's governments and representatives from the Andong Port Administration Bureau of the Northeast Navigation Bureau and the Andong Local Committee of the China Seamen's Union, together with their families. The Andong Port Administration Bureau also allocated 30 million yuan to comfort the families of the three victims. The director of the Andong Port Administration Bureau, Gan Mingwen, and the director of the Andong Local Committee of the Seamen's Union, Yang Kun, visited the other five injured fishermen who were sent to the Andong Municipal Hospital for treatment twice on August 30th and this month 3rd, and gave them 3.5 million yuan in consolation money. Representatives of the Andong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and various people's organizations in Andong City also brought goods to express their condolences on the day the injured fishermen were admitted to the hospital.

　　After the incident on August 29th when U.S. aircraft strafed the river surface east of Changdianhekou in Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, Xu Shoutang, the head of the Changdian District People's Government, immediately rushed to the home of the deceased fisherman Yin Xiaolin to help with the burial and express his condolences to his family. The Andong Port Administration Bureau and the Andong Local Committee of the Seamen's Union also sent people with 5 million yuan on the 3rd to express their condolences, and went to Lagu Shao Village to express their condolences to the injured fishermen Liang Zhongde and Li Dianchen who were recuperating there (Li has now been discharged from the hospital after treatment). The Kuandian County People's Government and the County Committee of the Communist Party of China also sent people to express their condolences, instructing them to rest assured and promising that the government would take good care of the lives of their families. A delegation from the People's Organizations of all circles, led by Zhang Pingqi, the Deputy County Governor of the County People's Government, and Ai Chengfa, the Director of the Trade Union, set off a few days ago to conduct condolences and comfort to the families of the eleven deceased and injured fishermen.
