[Hegang News] Special correspondent Xu Tiemin reports: In order to adapt to the new coal mining methods and the new situation after mechanized mining, the Hegang Mining Bureau, with the approval of the Northeast Coal Mining Administration, further reformed its production organization in early August, changing the three-tier system of leadership of Bureau-Mine-Pit to a two-tier system of Bureau-Pit.

The Hegang Mining Bureau originally had a three-tier organization, with the Bureau setting up mines, and the mines setting up administrative pit entrances, each administrative pit entrance governing two to five inclined pits. Before the widespread implementation of the new coal mining method, the entire bureau had three mines, twelve administrative pit entrances, and thirty-eight inclined pit entrances. Under the condition of highly dispersed pit entrances, three-tier leadership was indeed necessary. After implementing the new coal mining method to concentrate pit entrances, and then implementing mechanized production in May, the output per face unit increased from 100 tons per day to 500 tons. With the current total output unchanged, only thirteen inclined pits and thirteen faces are needed to complete the coal production task. With fewer pit entrances and fewer faces, the original three-tier organization is no longer suitable. The Bureau then, according to the transportation conditions and coal output of each pit, merged them into six pit entrances, directly under the leadership and control of the Bureau, and abolished the large mine-level organization. The significant benefits are threefold: First, a large number of administrative and technical leaders are directly assigned to work at the pit entrance site, strengthening the administrative and technical leadership of the pit entrance and the site. Now, each coal mining face and each small shift has technical personnel in coal mining, safety, and electromechanical aspects to provide guidance. Therefore, the maintenance of face specifications, the application and repair of coal cutting machines, the coordination of support filling, and the implementation of charting can all maximize their effectiveness. Second, administrative leadership and technical leadership are unified, giving technical personnel authority, and making technical personnel responsible for work related to technical issues. This implements the technical responsibility system and changes the past attitude of technical personnel being merely advisors. Third, it can save the management costs of the large leadership organization at the mine level and reduce costs.

The new pit entrance organization structure: A pit director and a deputy pit director are set up. The pit director sets up five sections under the leadership of the engineer: coal mining section, safety section, electromechanical section, transportation section, and efficiency statistics section. Section chiefs are all technicians with organizational skills. The deputy pit director sets up three sections: finance, personnel, and secretarial, to handle cost, materials, finance, labor organization, documents, general affairs, and other work.

In the process of reforming the organizational structure, the Bureau's experience proves that the first thing to pay attention to is the issue of education. On the one hand, the education of the importance of technology and the overall ideological education of the working class should be strengthened among the workers. The workers should clearly understand that technical personnel are also part of the working class, and recognize the important role and guiding position of technical personnel in mine production. On the other hand, the education of their sense of ownership should be strengthened among technical personnel, so that they clearly understand that they are also an important part of the working class, break the idea of being guests, strengthen the education of the combination of technical personnel and the masses, and improve their organizational ability and political leadership ability, so that they become people's technical workers who meet the identity of the working class. Secondly, the handling of surplus cadres is a very important issue. The Bureau does not lower the job positions and salary treatment of mine-level cadres who are transferred to the pit. For the surplus pit-level class cadres, a long-term school is still established according to the original salary to cultivate them in order to improve their cultural and technical level. At the same time, workers and cadres with a certain level of education and practical experience are boldly promoted to be technicians.

Simultaneous with the change of the administrative organization, the Party, the trade union, and the Youth League also established branches in the face. A pit entrance general branch is established at the pit entrance to ensure the smooth completion of the production tasks.

　　鹤岗矿务局适应机械化开采的新情况
    变三级组织领导为两级制
    【本报鹤岗讯】特约通讯员许铁民报道：鹤岗矿务局为适应新采煤方法及机械化开采后的新情况，经东北煤矿管理局研究批准，已于八月初进一步改革生产组织，将局、矿、坑三级制领导变为局、坑两级制。
    鹤岗矿务局原为三级组织，即局下设矿，矿下设行政坑口，每一行政坑口辖二到五个斜坑。在普遍实行新采煤法前，全局有三个矿，十二个行政坑口，三十八个斜坑坑口。在坑口十分分散的情况下，三级领导实属必要。实行新采煤法集中坑口后，继于五月又实行机械化生产，以掌子为单位的产量由日产一百吨增至五百吨。在目前总产量不变的情况下，有十三个斜坑，十三个掌子即可完成产煤任务。坑口减少，掌子减少，原来的三级组织已不适用。该局遂根据各坑搬运条件、出煤情况合并为六个坑口，直接归局领导掌握，取消矿一级的庞大机构。其显著好处有三：第一是大批行政技术领导干部直接分配到坑口现场工作，加强了坑口与现场的行政领导与技术领导。现在每个采煤掌子与每小班皆有采煤、保安、机电三方面的技术人员从事指导。因而对于掌子规格的保持，截煤机的运用与修理，支柱充填的配合，图表制的贯彻都能发挥其最大效能。第二是统一了行政领导和技术领导，给技术人员以职权，使有关技术问题的工作交技术人员负责，这就贯彻了技术责任制并转变了过去技术人员只能是建议性质的作客态度。第三可节省矿一级庞大领导机构的管理费用，减低成本。
    新的坑口组织机构：设坑长、副坑长各一人。坑长下设工程师领导采煤股、保安股、机电股、运输股、效率统计股五股。股长均由有组织能力的技术员担任。副坑长下设财务、人事、秘书三股，以便处理成本、材料、财务、劳动组织、文件、总务等工作。
    在进行组织机构改革中，该局经验证明首先该注意解决的是教育问题。一方面应从工人群众中加强技术重要性的教育与工人阶级整体思想教育。使工人明确认识到技术人员也是工人阶级的组成部分，认识到技术人员在矿山生产中的重要作用和指导地位。另一方面在技术人员中应加强其主人翁思想教育，使其明确自己也是工人阶级的重要组成部分，打破作客思想，加强技术人员和群众结合的教育，提高其组织能力与政治领导能力，使之成为符合工人阶级身份的人民技术工作者。其次，对编余干部的处理，是个十分重要的问题。该局对矿级下坑干部，不降低其工作职位与薪金待遇。对编余的坑内班级干部，仍按原薪不动成立长期学校进行培养，以提高他们的文化、技术水平。同时，对有一定文化程度，且有实际经验的工人干部，大胆提升为技术员。
    与行政组织机构改变同时，党、工会与青年团也在掌子内建立支部。坑口则成立坑口总支部，以保证生产任务的顺利完成。
