To the Editor:

　　Having seen the news in the September 2nd newspaper that a solar eclipse will occur on September 12th, the Science Popularization Bureau hopes that the masses will observe it to dispel superstitions. I would like to offer some suggestions for readers' reference: In ophthalmology, there is a disease called "solar eclipse blindness." The cause of this disease is mostly from observing solar eclipses. (If you stare at it for a little too long, it can cause blindness.) This is because the sun's heat radiation can damage the retina; mild damage can cause decreased vision, and severe damage can cause blindness.

　　The year before last, after a solar eclipse in Beijing, we saw three cases at Tongren Hospital. Fortunately, they were all mild damage and did not result in blindness. Therefore, when observing a solar eclipse, one should use dark-colored glass (dark green or dark brown are both acceptable, such as using broken soda bottles or applying thick ink to the glass); or use a basin filled with water, add a small amount of ink, and place it in the sunlight, observing the shadow of the sun in the water basin to see its eclipse. The observation time should not exceed half a minute.

### 怎样观察日食？

　　怎样观察日食？编辑同志：
    见九月二日报纸刊登九月十二日将发生日食的消息，科学普及局希望群众观测，以破除迷信。对此我愿提供一些意见，供读者参考：在眼科学上有一种病叫做“日食盲”。得该病的原因，多由观测日食而来。（如注视时间稍长，就有使人失明的可能）。因为太阳的热照射在视网膜上，能使之发生损害；轻者使视力减退，重的就会失明。
    前年北京在日食之后，在同仁医院我们曾看到过三个病例。幸而他们都是轻度的损害，没有失明。因此，在观测日食时，应当用深色玻璃（深绿深褐色均可，如用碎的汽水瓶子或者在玻璃上涂抹浓墨亦可）；或用盆盛水，注以少量墨汁，放置在太阳光下，在水盆中观察太阳的影子，以窥其亏蚀。观察时间，以不超过半分钟为宜。
