Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 31st -- According to a dispatch from the Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, on the 29th: Under MacArthur's instructions, the Yoshida government is preparing to dismiss all Communist Party members from public office. Recently, several key ministers in the cabinet have also been discussing the expulsion of progressive teachers and professors. At the same time, Japanese police are continuing to search for Japanese Communist Party leaders who have been illegally "purged." MacArthur has ordered the Japanese police to issue arrest warrants and put them on the wanted list. However, these actions are all in vain.

MacArthur's terror cannot intimidate the Japanese people. Many railway workers in Sapporo and students in Hokkaido have recently been arrested for distributing leaflets attacking American warmongers and their aggression against the Korean people. In Osaka, a large number of similar leaflets have also been distributed. Sailors and workers in Sasebo refuse to load supplies destined for South Korea. These reports reflect the true sentiments of the Japanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th -- According to a report from the Japanese United News Agency: The League Against Suppression of Speech, organized by the All-Japan News Workers Union and progressive journalists who have been illegally "dismissed," convened a meeting in Tokyo on August 9th, bringing together over a hundred representatives from its members and 36 democratic organizations, including the All-Japan Labor Unions Liaison Council (Zenroren). The conference believes that these illegal "dismissals" are a large-scale "purge" carried out by the reactionaries in order to launch a war. The meeting decided to print one million leaflets and five hundred thousand slogans for distribution and posting. It also decided to raise one million yen as a sympathetic aid to those who have been "dismissed." Regarding the opposition to the large-scale "dismissal" movement that is about to come, the conference decided to use Zenroren as the center for national sympathetic aid. The conference also issued a declaration based on these resolutions. At the meeting, the cultural troupe of the Tokyo Regional Association of the Japan Film and Theater Workers' Union decided to conduct planned activities every day. The Civil Engineering and Construction Workers' Union decided to first establish a "League Not to Buy Reactionary Newspapers." A people's radio station has been set up within the Kanto branch of the Tokyo Electric Industry Workers' Union to expose the false news of the bourgeoisie and broadcast correct news and cultural entertainment programs. At the same time, protest movements are being carried out.

　　日工人学生坚持斗争
    拒运侵朝物资、散发反美传单 
    “反对镇压言论同盟”抗议非法“解雇”
    【新华社三十一日讯】据电通社东京二十九日讯：在麦克阿瑟的指使下，吉田政府正在准备解除一切共产党员的公职。最近，内阁若干主要大臣也在商讨开除进步教师及教授。同时，日本警察还在继续搜捕被非法“整肃”的日本共产党领袖，麦克阿瑟已命令日警发出拘票，通缉他们。但是，这些行动都枉费了气力。
    麦克阿瑟的恐怖行为并不能吓倒日本人民。札幌的铁道工人及北海道的学生多人，最近因散发传单，攻击美国战争贩子与他们侵略朝鲜人民而被捕。在大阪，也有人在散发大批类似的传单。佐世保的海员及工人拒绝装载运往南朝鲜的物资。这些消息都反映出日本人民的真实情绪。
    【新华社三十日讯】据日本联合通讯社消息：由全日新闻工会及被非法“解雇”的进步新闻工作者组织的反对镇压言论同盟，于八月九日在东京召集盟员及全日工会联络协议会（全劳联）等三十六个民主团体的代表一百数十人，举行会议。大会认为：这次的非法“解雇”是反动派为了要发动战争而进行的大规模“整肃”。会议决定印制一百万张传单和五十万张标语，以便散发张贴。并决定募集一百万日元，作为对被“解雇”者的同情援助。关于反对即将到来的大规模“解雇”运动，大会决定以全劳联作为全国性同情援助的中心。大会并根据这些决议，发表了宣言。会上，日本电影演剧工会东京地方协会的文工团，决定每日有计划地进行活动。土木建筑工会决定首先成立“不买反动报纸同盟”。东京的电气产业工会关东支部内已设立了人民广播电台，揭露资产阶级的虚假新闻，播发正确新闻及文化娱乐节目。同时并进行抗议运动。
