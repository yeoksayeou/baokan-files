　　Plain Province Garrison Regiment Staff Officer Zhang Kejian
    Executes Civilians, Sentenced to Death by Firing Squad According to Law

    In February of this year, an unfortunate incident occurred in Liudiansi Village, Qi County, Plain Province. Zhang Kejian, a staff officer of the Plain Province Military Region Garrison Regiment, led nine soldiers in a conflict with the masses of Liudiansi Village and other villages due to the blasting of a bunker, resulting in the deaths of two civilians and injuries to four others. This severely impacted the prestige of the People's Army and the relationship between the military and the people. The occurrence of this incident was due to the bureaucratic tendencies of the regiment's leadership, as well as the severe warlordism and lack of a mass perspective among certain cadres. The Plain Province Military Region has submitted a request to the North China Military Region for approval to execute the principal offender, Zhang Kejian, and to impose severe punishments on the cadres of the regiment involved in this incident. The Discipline Inspection Commission of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has also given severe punishments to the Party member cadres involved in this incident.

    The details of the incident are as follows: There was a bunker located at the bend of the Qi River in Liudiansi Village, Qi County, Plain Province. This bunker could strengthen the embankment and prevent flooding, which was related to the interests of the masses in several nearby villages. Therefore, the masses in this area had always resolutely protected this bunker and did not allow anyone to damage it.

    The Plain Military Region Garrison Regiment, because of insufficient production tools, and without proper investigation and research, consideration of the interests of the masses, or solicitation of opinions from the masses and the local government, decided to blast this bunker to obtain steel bars. This decision was blindly advocated by Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang Jin and approved by the regiment committee. On February 25th, Zhang Kejian, the regiment's staff officer, led fifteen demolition experts and six workers to Chaodian Village in the Sixth District of Qi County, about one li away from the bunker, and set up camp. After inspecting the bunker, Zhang Kejian returned to the regiment headquarters to report the situation.

    At 11:00 AM on February 26th, Deputy Platoon Leader Bian Siyuan (demolition expert) of the Second Battalion led nine soldiers and six workers to blast the bunker. At that time, more than ten civilians came to stop them. Coincidentally, Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang Jin was passing by on his way to Xinxiang. The masses repeatedly asked Zhang Jin not to blast the bunker, saying, "If you must use steel bars, the people are willing to pay to buy them." However, Zhang Jin resolutely refused the demands of the masses and hurried to catch his train, telling Hao Yongdi, the Deputy Chief of the Regiment's Administration Section, who was traveling with him, to explain to the masses. Because the masses insisted on not letting them destroy the bunker, Hao Yongdi issued an order to Deputy Platoon Leader Bian: "You must destroy it, whether they allow it or not." After saying this, he went to catch up with Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang. The masses were extremely angry and resolutely refused to allow the bunker to be blasted; Deputy Platoon Leader Bian led everyone back.

    At 5:00 PM, Regiment Staff Officer Zhang Kejian arrived at Chaodian. After hearing the reports from the demolition personnel, he did not consider the opinions of the masses and led nine comrades to blast the bunker again. Six or seven hundred people from six administrative villages, including Liudiansi and nearby Niangniangmiao, Huangwangmiao, Wulou, Gaozhuang, and Liuguaizhuang, gathered in front of the bunker, resolutely opposing the demolition of the bunker. As a result, a conflict arose, resulting in the unfortunate incident of two civilians being killed and four civilians being injured. At that time, Zhang Kejian was grabbed by two civilians, and he shot and killed one of them with his pistol and fled.

    After the incident, the Plain Province Military Region and the Plain Province People's Government sent responsible cadres to Liudiansi, respectively, to investigate and handle the matter together with the Qi County Magistrate and the Minister of Organization of the Qi County Party Committee. First, they buried the two deceased and provided each with 1,000 jin of millet as compensation. The four injured were sent to the Qi County People's Hospital for treatment, and each was given 300 jin of millet as compensation. They also expressed condolences to the families of the deceased and injured. The Garrison Regiment also sent people to the hospital to express condolences to the injured. In addition, a meeting of mass representatives was convened. At the meeting, the Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Garrison Regiment admitted the mistake to the masses and explained that those who caused the incident would be strictly dealt with. The mass representatives also expressed their attitude and acknowledged that some actions were excessive.

    In order to rectify Party discipline and military discipline, and to educate the entire army with this incident, the Discipline Inspection Commission of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has made decisions on the punishment of relevant Party member cadres. The Plain Province Military Region has also submitted a request to the North China Military Region for approval to impose severe punishments on relevant personnel. The results of the handling are as follows:

    Regiment Staff Officer Zhang Kejian, knowing that the masses had repeatedly requested that the bunker not be destroyed, still led the team to blast it; and when he caused sharp opposition with the masses, he still did not accept the demands of the masses, thus causing a bloody incident; he also personally shot and killed one civilian. Therefore, in addition to being expelled from the Party, the military judicial organs have executed him by firing squad in accordance with the principle that "those who kill innocent people should immediately pay with their lives."

    Hao Yongdi, Deputy Chief of the Regiment's Administration Section, privately issued an order to resolutely destroy the bunker, which aroused the anger of the masses; this was one of the causes of this incident. Therefore, he is given a punishment of one year of probation within the Party, and a punishment of three years of imprisonment administratively.

    Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang Jin, blindly advocated blasting the bunker first, and disregarded the demands of the masses later, and should bear the main responsibility for the occurrence of this incident. Therefore, he is given a punishment of removal from the regiment party committee within the party, and a punishment of demotion administratively.

    Regiment Commander Wang Quan made a hasty decision on the bunker demolition issue, and his daily education and management of subordinate cadres was insufficient; Deputy Political Commissar Xue Jinghua of the regiment participated in the bunker demolition decision, and after receiving the report, he did not consider it and insisted on the original proposal. Both were given a warning within the Party.

### 平原省警备团参谋张克俭  杀伤群众依法枪决

　　平原省警备团参谋张克俭
    杀伤群众依法枪决
    今年二月，平原省淇县刘店寺村发生了平原省军区警备团参谋张克俭率领战士九人因爆破碉堡而和刘店寺等村群众发生冲突，并开枪打死群众两人、打伤群众四人的不幸事件，严重地影响了人民军队的威信以及军民关系。这个事件的发生，是由于该团领导上的官僚主义以及某些干部的严重的军阀主义和缺乏群众观点。平原省军区已呈请华北军区批准，把主犯张克俭枪决，并给该团与此事件有关的干部以严厉处分。中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会亦已给与此事件有关的党员干部以严厉处分。
    事件的经过情形如下：平原省淇县刘店寺村淇河拐湾处，有一个碉堡。这个碉堡能固堤防水，关系着附近几个村的群众利益。因此，这一带村庄的群众对这个碉堡一向是坚决保护，不让人破坏的。
    平原军区警备团因为生产工具不够用，没有很好调查研究、考虑群众利害、征求群众与当地政府的意见，就由副团长张晋盲目倡议、团委会批准，决定爆破这个碉堡，以取钢筋。二月二十五日，该团参谋张克俭就率领爆破手十五名及工人六名，到距碉堡一里许的淇县六区朝店村驻下。张克俭看了碉堡后，就回到团部报告情况。
    二十六日上午十一时，二营卞思远副排长（爆破手）带了战士九名、工人六名去爆破碉堡。当时就有老百姓十余人前来阻止。恰在此时，该团副团长张晋去新乡路过此地。群众就向张晋再三要求不要爆破碉堡，并说：“如果你们一定要用钢筋，老百姓愿意出钱去买。”但张晋却坚决不答应群众的要求，自己忙着去赶火车，就叫同路的团管理股副股长郝永棣向群众解释。郝永棣因群众坚持不让破碉堡，竟向卞排副发命令说：“叫破也得破，不叫破也得破。”说完，就去追赶张副团长去了。群众极为愤怒，坚决不让爆破碉堡；卞排副就率领大家回去了。
    下午五时，团参谋张克俭到了朝店，听到爆破人员的反映后，也不考虑群众意见，又率领九个同志前去爆破碉堡。刘店寺及其附近娘娘庙、皇王庙、吴楼、高庄、刘拐庄等六个行政村的群众六七百人在碉堡前集合，坚决反对爆碉堡。于是，就引起了冲突，造成了打死群众二人、打伤群众四人的不幸事件。当时张克俭曾被两个群众抱住，他竟用手枪打死一个群众而逃走。
    事情发生后，平原省军区、平原省人民政府就分别派负责干部到刘店寺，会同淇县县长、淇县县委组织部长等调查处理这件事情。首先，为两个死者安葬，并每人抚恤小米一千斤，伤者四人送淇县人民医院治疗，每人抚恤小米三百斤，并慰问了死伤者的家属。警备团也派人到医院去慰问了受伤者。此外，还召开了群众代表会议。在会上，警备团政治处副主任向群众承认了错误，并说明对造成此事件者要进行严格处理。群众代表也表示了态度，承认有些过火行为。
    为了整肃党纪军纪，并以此事件教育全军，中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会已对有关党员干部作出处分决定；平原省军区也已呈请华北军区批准，给有关人员以严厉处分。其处理结果如下：
    团参谋张克俭，明知群众数次要求不要破堡，竟仍率队前去爆破；而在与群众造成尖锐对立时，仍不接受群众要求，遂造成流血事件；他还亲自打死群众一人。因此，除开除其党籍外，军法机关已根据“杀死无辜人民者应即偿命”的原则执行枪决。
    团副管理股长郝永棣，私发坚决破堡命令，激起群众愤怒；这是造成此事件的原因之一。故党内予以留党察看一年处分，行政上予以徒刑三年处分。
    副团长张晋，盲目倡议爆破碉堡于先，不顾群众要求于后，应负此事件发生之主要责任。故党内予以撤消团党委处分，行政上予以撤职处分。
    团长王铨，对于破堡问题草率决定，加以平日对所属干部教育管理不够；团副政委薛经华参加破堡决定，事后得到报告不考虑，仍坚持原议。两人均受党内通令警告处分。
