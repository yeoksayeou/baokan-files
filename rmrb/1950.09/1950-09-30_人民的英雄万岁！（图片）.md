　　Long Live the Heroes of the People!
    At 4:00 PM on September 25, 1950, the National Congress of Combat Heroes and the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers jointly held an opening ceremony in Beijing, the capital. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government personally attended the meeting to offer congratulations. Also present were leaders of the Central People's Government, leaders of various people's organizations, the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and other foreign guests.

    Chairman Mao's presence brought excitement and encouragement to the entire venue, and the representatives welcomed their leader with prolonged and warm applause. Chairman Mao read a congratulatory message to the congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The congratulatory message pointed out: "China must establish a strong national defense force and a strong economic force. These are two major tasks. Both of these tasks depend on the comrades and all the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, together with the workers, peasants, and other people of the country, uniting as one and working together to achieve their goals."

    Combat Hero representative Wei Laiguo, industrial labor model representative Liu Yingyuan, and agricultural labor model representative Liu Yuhou delivered speeches on behalf of all the representatives of the two congresses.
