Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 28th dispatch from TASS: 25,000 laboring people in Vienna, the capital of Austria, held a grand demonstration in front of the Prime Minister's Office Square on September 26th to protest the government's increase in prices.

    On that morning, many businesses in Vienna ceased work. Columns of thousands of workers surged towards the city center. The demonstrators held high flags and banners with slogans such as: "We demand wage increases!" "Down with the government's treacherous party conspiracies!" "We need bread and peace!" "Down with high prices!"

    The government mobilized a large number of police to strengthen the security around the Prime Minister's Office. Streets and side streets were blocked off with police cars, and water cannons from fire trucks were used in an attempt to disperse the demonstration. However, the demonstrators broke through the police cordons and successfully converged on the square and nearby streets.

    The demonstrators immediately held a rally in front of the Prime Minister's Office. Speakers at the rally unanimously raised the demands of all Austrian workers: reduce prices and increase wages. The demonstrators put forward a delegation, preparing to present the workers' demands to the cabinet meeting, which was discussing how to raise prices, but were unable to enter the Prime Minister's Office.

    During the meeting, an aircraft painted with American insignia circled low over the square. The masses shouted, "Americans, get out!"

    Similar demonstrations and rallies were also held in other major industrial centers in Austria.

　　抗议政府提高物价
    奥劳动人民大示威
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社维也纳讯：奥地利首都维也纳二万五千名劳动人民，于九月二十六日为抗议政府提高物价在总理府前广场举行了盛大示威。
    当日早晨，维也纳的许多企业都停止了工作。成千的工人纵队，向市中心区源源不断地潮涌而来。参加示威的人高举着旗帜和标语牌，上面写着：“我们要求增加工资！”“打倒政府奸党阴谋诡计！”“我们需要面包与和平！”，“打倒高物价！”
    政府调动了大批警察加强总理府的戒备，大街和横街，都以警车封锁，并以救火车水龙喷射，想借此驱散示威的队伍。但是示威群众仍冲破了警察的层层警备线，在广场上和附近街道上胜利汇合。
    示威群众当即在总理府门前召开大会。在会上演说的人一致提出奥地利全体工人的要求：削减物价和增加工资。示威群众推出了代表团，准备向正在讨论如何提高物价的内阁会议，陈述工人的要求，但未能进入总理府。
    在开会时，一架漆着美国标志的飞机，在广场低空盘旋。群众高呼：“美国人滚回去！”
    奥地利其他各大工业中心城市也都举行了类似的示威与集会。
