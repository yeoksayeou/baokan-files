　　All-China Students' Federation Sends Telegram to Comfort Students in France
    Hoping to Strengthen Unity, Be Vigilant Against Chiang Kai-shek Gang's Persecution Conspiracy, and Return to the Country Early to Participate in the Construction of New China
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] The All-China Students' Federation sent a telegram to the General Association of Chinese Students in Paris, France on the 18th, expressing sympathy for the sabotage of the student association's venue by special agents instructed by war criminal Chen Lifu.
    The telegram stated: War criminal Chen Lifu, carrying a large amount of US dollars, bribed hooligans in France in an attempt to persecute our upright and patriotic overseas Chinese students in France; and on the 10th, he instructed special agents to destroy the student association's venue, which is infuriating. We extend our cordial greetings to you, hoping that you will strengthen unity and be vigilant against the persecution conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek gang; and hope that you will return to the country early after completing your studies to participate in the great cause of building a new China.
