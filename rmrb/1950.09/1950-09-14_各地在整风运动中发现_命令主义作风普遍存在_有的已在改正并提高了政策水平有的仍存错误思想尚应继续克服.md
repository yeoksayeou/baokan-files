　　Reports from this newspaper: The most common error found in the rectification movement in various places is commandism in the work style of cadres. The rectification meetings in various places in the Central and Southern District found that the most egregious forms of this commandism were indiscriminate beatings, arrests, and various forms of disguised corporal punishment. For example, in the Yichang area, 75 cadres had personally beaten people, including 22 veteran cadres and 53 new cadres. The phenomenon of cadres beating and fining people was also very serious in the East China District. In Tonglu County, Zhejiang, 200,000 catties of fertilizer were loaned to the masses, of which 150,000 catties had already become moldy. The price was also high, and the masses were forced to buy it. The masses were very dissatisfied, saying it was "more expensive than usury." In Taizhou, Northern Jiangsu, during the summer public security campaign, thieves were caught, but instead of patiently educating and reforming them, they were punished by beating, resulting in death. An investigation by a public security sub-bureau in Shanghai revealed that 90% of criminal offenders had been beaten. In Helin District, Suiyuan Province, North China, 69 people were detained for prohibiting the masses from planting opium. The district militia captain detained 13 people, and a district youth cadre tied up 10 people. There are many similar examples of coercion and commandism in various places. Therefore, in the leadership of the rectification movement in various places, they have focused on this serious error among cadres. Through reading documents and summarizing work, they have corrected these errors through document study and work inspection, and have generally gained results. For example, after the rectification in the Southwest District, the general cadres have a relatively deep understanding of the tendencies of commandism, which are generally present in their work. Therefore, they have improved their policy level and understood the view of unifying tasks and policies. The general reflection of the cadres is that the "rectification is correct," they have learned something, and their confidence in future work has also been improved. The first phase of rectification at the Party School in Northern Jiangsu, through reading documents and inspecting production, disaster relief, water management, grain requisition, taxation, and other work in the past year, exposed the errors of commandism, enabling cadres to establish the correct thinking of following the mass line ideologically. Cadres at all levels in Tianjin County, Hebei, implemented the spirit of Party rectification and cadre rectification in their work, deeply recognized the harm of bureaucracy and commandism, and transformed the past coercive work style in the summer grain requisition and loan recovery work. They began to explore the working methods of following the mass line, so that the summer grain requisition work could better grasp policies, be fair and reasonable, be realistic, and successfully complete the task.

　　Although many cadres in various places have clearly understood the harm of commandism in their thinking and actively and consciously participated in the rectification, there are still many cadres who have not completely resolved it in their thinking. The main ones are district and township cadres. Their understanding of opposing commandism and implementing the mass line is still very vague, and some even hold antagonistic emotions. For example, in the rectification in Chang'an County, Northwest, some cadres said: "It is good not to allow coercion and command, but what should we do if some people deliberately provoke the government?" Others said: "I will never dare to beat people again. If there are people who do not complete their work, I will smile at them!" In the East China District, during the rectification movement, it was found that some cadres in some areas, although they also admitted in principle that commandism was wrong, one-sidedly emphasized "contradictions between policies and tasks," "contradictions between time and tasks," and "the masses' awareness cannot keep up with the task requirements," believing that "in some special circumstances, coercion and command must be used to complete the task," "the masses in the new areas are backward, so we have to use coercion and command," and even thought that "commandism is better than tailism, and can complete the task," "beating and scolding bad people is not a big mistake." The reason for these wrong understandings is that some cadres still do not clearly understand the harm of commandism and that correct methods can better complete the task. Also, because they have made many shortcomings and mistakes in their work, and some have been affected by certain biases in the past "Three Check-ups and Three Rectifications," they have many concerns about the rectification, fearing investigation and punishment in the rectification, so they avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, and even distort the facts and refuse to thoroughly examine themselves. In some areas, the rectification time is short, and the leadership has failed to give a strong criticism of the cadres' wrong thoughts from the root. These still need to arouse the attention of the rectification leadership in various places and be further corrected.

　　各地在整风运动中发现
    命令主义作风普遍存在
    有的已在改正并提高了政策水平有的仍存错误思想尚应继续克服
    【本报讯】各地在整风运动中，发现了最普遍的错误是干部作风上的命令主义。中南区各地整风会议发现这种命令主义最恶劣的形式是乱打、乱捕和各种变相肉刑。如宜昌地区干部亲自打过人的就有七十五人，其中老干部二十二人，新干部五十三人。华东区干部打人罚人现象也很严重。浙江桐庐县贷给群众肥料二十万斤，其中十五万斤已经霉烂，价钱又贵，还强迫群众购买，群众大为不满，说是“比高利贷还贵”。苏北泰州在开展夏季治安工作中捉住了小偷，不耐心加以感化教育，却用打的方式去惩处，结果竟打死了人。上海一个公安分局检讨，有百分之九十的刑事犯挨过打。华北绥远省和林一区为禁止群众种大烟就扣押了六十九人，区大队长一人即扣过十三人，区青年干部则捆过十人。各地类似这些强迫命令的事例是很多的。因此，各地在整风领导上都抓住了目前在干部中这一严重的错误，经过阅读文件、总结工作，从文件学习和工作检查中来纠正这些错误，一般都有收获。如西南区经过整风以后，一般干部对于普遍存在于工作中的命令主义等倾向，有了比较深刻的认识，因而提高了政策水平，明白了任务与政策统一的观点。干部普遍的反映是“整的对”，学到了东西，对今后工作的信心也提高了。苏北党校第一期整风从阅读文件与检查一年来生产救灾、治水、征粮、税收等工作中，揭露了命令主义的错误，使干部在思想上树立了走群众路线的正确思想。河北天津县各级干部在工作中贯彻了整党、整干精神，深刻认识了官僚主义和命令主义作风的危害，在夏征和收贷工作中转变了过去强迫命令的工作作风，开始摸索到走群众路线的工作方法，使夏征工作能够较好地掌握政策，公平合理，实事求是，顺利地完成了任务。
    虽然各地有许多干部在思想上明确了命令主义的危害，并积极自觉地参加整风，但仍有不少干部在思想上并未彻底解决。其中主要的是区乡干部。他们对于反对命令主义、贯彻群众路线认识还非常模糊，甚至抱有对抗情绪。如西北长安县整风中，有的干部说：“不准强迫命令是好的，但有的群众就借此故意向政府挑皮捣蛋怎么办？”有的则说：“我以后再不敢打人了，要是有群众不完成工作，我就对他笑！”华东区在整风运动中发现有些地区的部分干部在原则上虽也承认命令主义不对，但又片面地强调“政策与任务矛盾”，“时间与任务矛盾”，“群众觉悟赶不上任务要求”，认为“在某些特殊情况下，必须强迫命令才能完成任务”，“新区群众落后，只好强迫命令”，甚至以为“命令主义比尾巴主义好，可以完成任务”，“打骂坏人，不算大错”。产生这些错误认识的原因，是由于部分干部对命令主义的危害性及用正确方法可以更好地去完成任务还认识不清。又由于他们在工作中所犯的缺点和错误较多，有的受到过去三查三整中某些偏向的影响，对整风存在较多的顾虑，在整风中怕追查，怕处分，因之避重就轻，甚至歪曲事实，不肯彻底检讨。有的地区整风时间短促，领导上对干部的错误思想未能从根本上深刻地给以有力的批判。这些尚须引起各地整风领导上的注意，进一步加以纠正。
