　　The Zhengfeng Leadership of the CPC Ding County Committee
　　By our reporter Shang Kai
　　In leading the zhengfeng (rectification) movement throughout the region, the CPC Ding County Committee in Hebei Province gradually enhanced its understanding and clarified its thinking, enabling the movement to gradually embark on the correct path while constantly overcoming difficulties and correcting deviations. Currently, the county committee has found a relatively effective method for leading the zhengfeng.

　　The cadres who participated in this zhengfeng had mostly gone through the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Land Reform, and the People's Liberation War, and had participated in previous zhengfeng movements, possessing a certain amount of struggle experience. However, due to insufficient study, their theoretical and cultural levels were relatively low. Among the county committee members in the entire region, only a very small number had a middle school or higher elementary school education. It was difficult for them to independently study the zhengfeng instructions and absorb the zhengfeng experiences from various places through newspapers. They urgently needed specific leadership and assistance from the higher-level party committee. Otherwise, the zhengfeng at the county level could easily go astray into the path of empiricism and formalism. In many counties in the Ding County area, phenomena of studying without connecting to reality, checking work without focusing on key points, and emphasizing individual self-reflection occurred. However, these were corrected by the county committee through timely inspection and did not form major deviations.

　　How did the Ding County Committee achieve specific leadership?

　　Gaining experience through the directly affiliated organs of the county committee and clarifying the leadership ideology is an important step in achieving specific leadership. At the beginning of the zhengfeng, the leadership ideology of the Ding County Committee was extremely unclear. For example, in the zhengfeng study notice issued on July 4, it was stipulated that "studying documents should be connected with individual fragmentary self-reflection." When formulating the work inspection plan, it was mechanically stipulated to spend half a month inspecting work and half a month inspecting individuals. It was not until after studying the July 29 People's Daily editorial, "The Basic Link in Leading the Zhengfeng Movement," that they further understood the zhengfeng method of "focusing on checking and summarizing work" and revised the work inspection plan. However, they were still unclear about the inspection policy of "checking the implementation of policies and work style through main work." In the first work inspection report made by the county committee in early August, the key points were not obvious, and the content was not specific enough, which made everyone dissatisfied. On August 20, the various departments directly under the county committee began to inspect work. During the inspection, many departments were unable to grasp the key points and checked whatever was mentioned without a goal; some departments proposed more than fifty opinions and discussed them one by one; some departments discussed the expenditure of a bicycle for an entire morning. At this time, the county committee studied the instructions of the provincial committee and the zhengfeng experience of the Northeast Administrative Region, and further clarified that "checking work must focus on the main problems in the main work" and "solve other problems by solving the main problems." According to this spirit, the county committee inspected the zhengfeng situation of the organs directly under the county committee and Ding County, and found that the zhengfeng in many units had gone astray. Therefore, the county committee conducted research, mobilization, and deployment again. It was determined that the county committee, the special commissioner's office, and the counties should mainly inspect the implementation and execution of production policies. The various departments of the county and district should determine different inspection focuses based on their different work natures, around this overall center. Later, in the actual movement, inspections were conducted at any time, and problems were studied and corrected immediately; and the experience of advanced departments was used to promote the general. For example, the zhengfeng of the bank office was able to grasp the main problems, and the inspection was relatively thorough. It was organized to make a typical report at the conference, which was very enlightening for various departments.

　　Secondly, using its own experience to guide the zhengfeng of general counties and resolve the contradiction between zhengfeng and leading zhengfeng. The counties successively began to check their work after August 25. Due to unclear thinking, they generally felt that they had nowhere to start and actively requested the county committee for specific assistance. However, at this time, the county committee itself was also conducting zhengfeng, and could not go to the counties to lead, and it was inconvenient to frequently convene leading cadres from various counties for meetings due to the vast area. In order to solve this contradiction, the county committee convened a temporary head meeting of county secretaries in separate areas in early September, so as to quickly concentrate and quickly disperse. At this meeting, the county committee used the zhengfeng experience of directly affiliated units, combined with the vivid examples in the actual movement in various counties, to achieve specific leadership. From the reports of various counties, it was found that there were many problems. The general phenomenon was that the main problems could not be grasped, or the grasps were inappropriate, and at the same time, criticism and self-criticism could not be developed, and the inspection could not be deepened. For example, Qu Yang and Rao Yang both stipulated the inspection of five major tasks: industry, agriculture, taxation, culture and education, and public security, each of which was further divided into many small programs; the inspection focus of Shen Ze and Wu Ji was also unclear; Li County erroneously determined to check "key people" and conduct individual self-reflection; Xinle only had inspections from above, but no criticism from below; Xing Tang's zhengfeng leadership was not unified, and at the same time, it showed unwillingness to accept opinions from below and fear of criticism. After the report, the situation of each county was jointly analyzed and studied, and debates and criticisms were launched. In the process of discussion, many "experiences" that were originally considered good were transformed into shortcomings or deviations after analysis, and many practices that had been negated were re-affirmed. At the same time, the things that were budding were clarified and improved. Finally, the county committee improved and systematized these fragmentary and scattered situations and understandings. And implement the correct zhengfeng policy, specifically point out the steps and methods of checking work, so that the responsible cadres of each county initially grasped the spirit and policy of this zhengfeng movement, and improved their ideological understanding. The counties deeply felt that this method of cadres educating themselves and improving themselves in the actual movement was easier to accept than simply issuing instructions from the superior. Therefore, the problems of "what to check?" and "how to check?" were generally solved. The formalistic inspection method of attending to everything and the incorrect attitude of zhengfeng of being afraid of criticism were corrected. At the same time, most departments of the county committee and the special commissioner's office also convened cadre meetings of subordinate units in a concentrated or decentralized manner. For example, the Office of the County Committee convened a meeting of secretaries of various county committees, and the Public Security Office and the Taxation Bureau of the Special Commissioner's Office also convened meetings of bureau chiefs of various counties. In this way, it was possible to solicit opinions from below to help check the leadership; at the same time, because the businesses were the same, it was easy to specifically guide the zhengfeng method and deepen the movement.

　　Finally, adopting key inspections is also one of the important ways to achieve specific leadership. On September 10, the county committee organs and the special commissioner's office jointly organized inspection teams to go to Ding County to inspect the zhengfeng situation of their directly affiliated departments. For example: the Propaganda Department of the County Committee inspected the Propaganda Department of the County Committee, the Public Security Office inspected the County Public Security Bureau, and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Special Commissioner's Office inspected the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, etc. From this key inspection, it was found that most departments already knew to find key points in checking work, but in actual inspection, there were often too many key points and the inspection surface was too wide; there were also indeed inappropriate key points, or no key points were found. For example: the county government lacked an overall inspection focus, and the leadership did not make an inspection report, so it was not easy for various sections and bureaus to find the main problems; the supply and marketing cooperative did not check the business policy, but focused on checking the cadre relationship. The Education Section did not check the implementation of the education policy, but regarded the expenditure of funds and administrative leadership as the focus of inspection. The Industry and Commerce Section looked for commandism from all aspects without limit. After discovering the above problems, the inspection team jointly studied and corrected the problems with the leading cadres of various departments. The county committee should also use various methods to report the problems found in the inspection and the improvement opinions to the counties, so that they pay attention to prevention and correction, because these problems also exist in the counties.

　　At present, the zhengfeng movement in the whole region is developing in depth. In the progress of the movement, certain deviations may still occur. The county committee has decided to continue to adopt the above methods to conduct specific leadership, so as to guide the zhengfeng movement to advance victoriously.

　　中共定县地委的整风领导
    本报记者  商恺
    中共河北省定县地委，在领导全区整风运动中，逐步提高认识，明确思想，使运动在不断克服困难、纠正偏向中，逐步走上正确的道路。目前地委已找到了一条比较有效的整风领导方法。
    参加此次整风的干部，绝大多数都经过了抗日战争，土地改革和人民解放战争，并参加过以前的整风运动，有着一定的斗争经验；但由于学习不够，理论和文化水平较低。全区县委委员中，具有中学及高小程度的仅占极少数。要他们独立地研究整风指示，通过报纸接受各地整风经验是有困难的。他们迫切需要上级党委的具体领导和帮助。否则县一级的整风就很容易走向经验主义、形式主义的弯路，定县地委区不少县份，都曾发生了学习不结合实际，检查工作无重点，强调进行个人反省的现象。但经地委随时检查纠正，并未形成大的偏差。
    定县地委如何实现具体领导呢？
    通过地委直属机关取得经验，明确领导思想，是实现具体领导的重要步骤。定县地委在整风初期，领导思想是极不明确的。例如在七月四日所发整风学习通知上，就曾规定：“学习文件要联系个人的片断反省”。到制定检查工作计划时，又机械地规定用半月时间检查工作，半月时间检查个人。及至研究了七月二十九日人民日报社论：《领导整风运动的基本环节》一文后，始进一步领会了以“检查总结工作为主”的整风方法，修改了检查工作计划。但是对于“通过主要工作，检查政策的执行与作风”这一检查方针，却仍不明确。八月初地委所做的第一次工作检查报告中，重点不明显，内容不具体，使大家不够满意。八月二十日地委直属各部门开始检查工作。在检查中，有不少部门是抓不住重点，无目标的提到什么检查什么；有的部门提出五十多条意见，逐条讨论；有的部门为一辆自行车的开支问题，讨论了一个早上。这时地委研究了省委指示，和东北大行政区的整风经验，进一步的明确了“检查工作必须抓住主要工作中的主要问题”，“通过解决主要问题，将其他问题连带解决”。地委根据这一精神，检查了地委直属机关和定县的整风情况，发现不少单位的整风走了弯路。于是地委又重做研究、动员、布置。确定地委、专署和各县主要应检查生产政策的贯彻与执行。地、县各部门应围绕这一总的中心，根据不同的工作性质，确定不同的检查重点。后来在实际运动中，随时进行检查，发现问题随即研究纠正；并利用先进部门的经验，推动一般。如银行办事处的整风、能抓住主要问题，检查也比较深刻，即组织其在大会上做典型报告，对各部门启发很大。
    其次，利用本身经验，指导一般县的整风，解决整风与领导整风的矛盾。各县于八月二十五日后相继开始检查工作，因思想不明确，普遍感到无从下手，积极要求地委具体帮助。但这时地委本身也正进行整风，既不能分赴各县进行领导，又因地区辽阔，不便经常调集各县领导干部，开会研究。为了解决这一矛盾，地委于九月初分片召集了县书临时碰头会，以便迅速集中，迅速分散。在这个会议上，地委利用直属单位的整风经验，结合各县实际运动中的生动事例，实现具体领导。从各县汇报情况中，发现问题颇多。普遍的现象是抓不住主要问题，或抓的不恰当，同时批评与自我批评展不开，检查深入不下去。如曲阳、饶阳都规定检查工业、农业、税收、文教、治安等五大工作，其中每项下又分许多细小节目；深泽、无极检查重点也不明确；蠡县则错误地确定检查“重点人”，进行个人反省；新乐只有上面的检查，而没有结合下面的批评；行唐整风领导不统一，同时还表现了不愿接受下面意见，害怕批评。汇报之后，即就各县情况共同进行分析研究，展开争论与批判。在讨论过程中，有不少原来认为良好的“经验”，经过分析变成了缺点或偏向，也有不少被否定了的作法，又被重新肯定，同时，萌芽的东西得到了明确和提高。最后，地委将这些片断的零散的情况和认识，加以提高和系统化。并贯彻以正确的整风方针，具体指出检查工作的步骤和方法，使各县负责干部初步掌握了此次整风运动的精神和方针，从思想认识上提高一步。各县深深感到这种在实际运动中，采用干部自己教育自己，自己提高自己的办法，比单纯的由上级下指示容易接受。因而一般的解决了“检查什么？”与“怎样检查”的问题。纠正了那种面面俱到形式主义的检查方法，与害怕批评的不正确的整风态度。与此同时，地委与专署大多数部门，也都集中或分片召开了所属单位的干部会议。如地委办公室召集各县委会秘书会议，专署公安办公处、税务局、也召开各县局长会议。如此，既能征取下面意见，帮助检查领导；同时，因业务相同，便于具体指导整风方法，使运动更加深入。
    最后，采取重点检查，也是实现具体领导的重要方式之一。九月十日，地委机关与专署共同组织了检查组，到定县分头检查自己直属部门的整风情况。例如：地委宣传部检查县委宣传部、公安办事处检查县公安局，专署供销社检查县供销社等。从这次重点检查中，发现大多数部门，都已知道在检查工作中要找重点，但在实际检查中，却又往往重点太多，检查面太宽；也有的确定的重点不适当，或者没有找到重点。例如：县政府缺乏总的检查重点，领导上也未做检查报告，因而各科、局不易找到主要问题；供销社不检查经营方针，而偏重于检查干部关系。教育科不检查教育方针的贯彻实施，而将经费开支，行政领导做为检查重点。工商科则漫无边际的从各方面去找命令主义。检查组发现上述问题后，即分别与各部门领导干部共同研究纠正。地委还应将检查中发现的问题，及改进意见，利用各种方式通报各县，使其注意防止和纠正，因为这些问题，在各县也是存在的。
    目前全区整风运动正深入开展，在运动的前进中，还有可能发生某些偏向，地委已决定继续采取上述方式，进行具体领导，以便引导整风运动胜利前进。
