Xinhua News Agency, 6th – The latest issue of the *World Knowledge* weekly carries an essay by legal scholar and former judge at the Tokyo International Military Tribunal, Mei Ru'ao, written to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Japan's surrender, entitled "The Future of Japan." The essay begins by pointing out: Five years have quickly passed since Japan's surrender. Due to the U.S. imperialist monopolization of Japan and the U.S. imperialist ambition to dominate the world, not only has a free and democratic new Japan, built according to the principles of the Potsdam Declaration, not emerged, but the old Japan of fascist terror rule is being rapidly restored. From a dark perspective, Japan is once again treading the path of the Tojo era, potentially bringing another devastating disaster to the Japanese people.

The essay states: As everyone knows, Japan's major industries and foreign trade are now controlled by U.S. imperialism. Wall Street's monopoly capitalists already hold more than 50% of the shares in Japan's major industries. U.S. imperialism has built the largest airport in the Far East and over a dozen air force bases in Japan. The famous Japanese naval ports of Sasebo and Yokosuka have been restored as powerful U.S. naval bases. Many armaments factories, shipyards, and repair shops have reopened, working day and night for U.S. imperialism. Under the guise of increasing "police reserves" and "maritime safety forces," U.S. imperialism is restoring the Japanese army and navy. The essay points out: The aim of U.S. imperialism is to turn Japan into its colony economically, its base of aggression against Asia militarily, and also to mobilize Japanese manpower and resources as its cannon fodder and scapegoat.

The essay continues: The deprivation of various basic human rights, the impossibility of concluding a comprehensive peace treaty and rejoining the international community, the prohibition against establishing amicable relations and trade with the two major neighbors, China and the Soviet Union, coupled with the cruel reality of 12 million unemployed and 80 billion yen worth of Japanese goods remaining unsold—all of this has caused the vast majority of the Japanese people, including workers, farmers, students, democrats, intellectuals, and small- and medium-sized businesspeople, to harbor extreme resentment towards U.S. imperialism and its Japanese lackeys. Since last spring, a rising anti-American tide has been gradually swelling in Japan. Faced with this increasingly high anti-American tide, U.S. imperialism and its Japanese lackeys, in panic and trepidation, are frantically stepping up the persecution of the democratic and progressive forces, led by the Japanese Communist Party, who are fighting for independence and freedom.

The essay points out: Fascist terror and persecution only expose the outward strength but inner weakness of U.S. imperialism. On the other hand, they enable the broad masses of the Japanese people to further recognize the true face of U.S. imperialism and strengthen the determination of patriotic people to strive for independence and freedom. Since the large-scale "purges" of progressive leaders, the number of people in Japan signing peace appeals has suddenly increased by two-fold. Many facts demonstrate that fascist terror has not, and cannot, deter the rising anti-American tide among the Japanese people.

The essay concludes: The Japanese people's struggle for independence and liberation is not isolated. All freedom-, democracy-, and peace-loving people around the world, especially the newly liberated Chinese people, will offer sympathy and assistance. Moreover, considerable contradictions exist among the countries within the imperialist camp regarding the Japan issue. Therefore, the future of Japan is bright. However, the Japanese people must continue to bravely struggle against U.S. imperialism and its Japanese puppets. This struggle is arduous, complex, and may be quite lengthy. But the final outcome of the struggle will surely be the complete victory of the Japanese people.

    《世界知识》载梅汝璈专文
    论《日本的前途》
    指出日本人民解放斗争并不孤立持续地勇敢地斗争必获最后胜利
    【新华社六日讯】最近一期《世界知识》周刊载有法学家前东京国际军事法庭法官梅汝璈为纪念日本投降五周年而作的一篇论文，题为《日本的前途》。论文首先指出：日本投降到今天的五个年头，已经匆匆地过去了。由于美帝独占日本的结果和美帝统治世界的野心，不但依据波茨坦宣言原则而建立的自由民主的新日本没有产生，而且法西斯恐怖统治的旧日本正在加快地恢复。从黑暗的一方面看，日本又在走上了东条时代的路线，可能再给日本人民带来一次惨重的灾难。
    论文写道：大家都知道，现在日本的大工商业和对外贸易都被美帝操纵着，华尔街的独占资本家已经握有日本各大工业百分之五十以上的股权。美帝在日本建筑了远东最大的飞机场和十几个空军基地；著名的日本军港佐世保和横须贺已经被修复为美帝的强大海军基地；许多兵工厂、造船厂和修理厂又都开了工，为美帝不分昼夜地工作着。在增加“警察后备队”和“海上保安队”的烟幕下，美帝正在恢复日本的陆军和海军。论文指出：美帝的目的，是要日本在经济上变为它的殖民地，在军事上变为它对亚洲的侵略基地，而且还要动员日本的人力物力做它的炮灰和替死鬼。
    论文称：各种基本人权的被剥夺，缔结全面和约重返国际大家庭的不可能，与中苏两大邻邦修睦通商的被阻禁，加上全国一千二百万人的失业和八百亿元日货滞销的惨酷事实，这一切都使日本广大民众，包括工人、农民、学生、民主人士、知识分子和中小资产企业界各阶层在内的广大民众，对美帝及其日本走狗发生极度的憎恶。自去年春天起，日本反美怒潮正逐渐高涨着。美帝及其日本走狗们面对着日益高涨的反美怒潮，在恐慌战栗之余，正疯狂地加紧迫害为独立自由而斗争的以日本共产党为首的民主进步势力。
    论文指出：法西斯恐怖的镇压和迫害只是一方面暴露美帝的外强中干，荏弱无力；另一方面却使广大的日本民众更加认清美帝的真面目，并使爱国志士加强争取独立自由的决心。自从进步领袖们被大批“整肃”以后，日本人民在和平呼吁书上签名的人数突然增加了两倍。许多事实都说明法西斯恐怖并没有，而且也不能吓退日本人民反美怒潮的高涨。
    论文结语称：日本人民争取独立解放的斗争，不是孤立的。全世界爱好自由民主和平的人民，尤其是新近获得全面解放的中国人民，都会予以同情和援助的。而且，帝国主义阵营内部各国在对日问题上也存在着相当大的矛盾。因此，日本的前途是光明的。但日本人民还必须持续地勇敢地对美帝及其日本傀儡们进行斗争。这个斗争是艰苦的、复杂的，而且可能是相当长期的。但是斗争的最后结果，必定是日本人民的完全胜利。
