　　Lüda People's Daily Editorial Calls for Overcoming Formalism and Promoting Rectification Movement
    [Our Newspaper Despatch] The Lüda People's Daily in Northeast China published an editorial on September 4, calling for deepening the rectification work. The editorial summarized the rectification situation in the Lüda area for more than a month, criticized the unrealistic formalistic tendencies in the movement, and proposed improvement measures. After the Lüda District Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the rectification plan on July 12 in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, it convened inspection meetings on four specific issues: Industrial Production Inspection Meeting, District Committee Leadership Ideological Style Inspection Meeting, Agricultural Production Inspection Meeting, and Financial and Trade Work Inspection Meeting. At the same time, various cities, counties, and enterprise departments also convened rectification meetings. The editorial pointed out that the major ideological obstacle currently hindering the further deepening of the rectification movement is the general, unrealistic formalistic tendency. Although some enterprise leading organs generally grasp the principle of combining rectification with production, they do not use their brains enough before inspecting the work, and do not carefully study what major problems exist in their own units in terms of production. Instead, they generally list the problems in parallel, the scope of the problems is very wide, and there is a lack of research, analysis and synthesis, so the inspection cannot hit the key points.
    Some people believe that "only rectifying work but not rectifying thoughts" "cannot solve the problem," and that inspecting personal ideological style and life problems is more "enjoyable" than inspecting work; some units isolate relationships and rectify them, and the more they rectify, the worse they become.
    Responsible cadres in some units adopt the policy of rectifying those above and below but not themselves, emphasizing that the higher authorities have not solved enough problems for them, emphasizing objective difficulties, complaining a lot, and not taking the responsibility they should bear. Some units only inspect some daily routine work, and do not focus on inspecting the implementation of principles and policies. Some people do not use the spirit of the documents to carry out criticism and inspection; others mechanically move rectification documents and instructions from higher authorities without considering how to combine them with their own business. A few units are not good at linking with reality and stay on the level of studying documents and drilling into terms. Some units even wait and see, lacking initiative in carrying out planned work, holding meetings without preparation, and rambling on at the meeting, resulting in no results.
    The editorial pointed out that the basic reason for the deviation is that the leadership at all levels, including the District Committee, has not fully understood and implemented the basic spirit of the rectification instructions of the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, and lacks in-depth education and explanation work for the lower levels.
    In order to correct these deviations and shortcomings and to develop and deepen the rectification movement, the editorial proposes the following improvement measures:
    First, leading cadres at all levels must continue to study the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau's previous rectification instructions, must-read rectification documents, and local experiences. In the main leading organs, it is especially necessary to repeatedly explain the spirit of rectification to the cadres, so that the cadres can understand it very clearly in their thinking, so that the rectification movement can fully comply with the spirit of the instructions. Leaders at all levels must also analyze and synthesize the implementation of basic policies and make self-criticism in order to help cadres improve their policy level and make the inspection something to follow.
    Secondly, in order to overcome the empty and unrealistic formalistic tendency, the leading organs of the Party, government, trade unions, and youth leagues at the enterprise and city-county levels should conduct typical investigations and research on the work of their own departments and regions, so as not to raise problems in general. Only in this way can we contact the masses, contact reality, raise major problems, give concrete analysis and summaries, raise them to the height of policy principles, so as to solve problems, promote work, and educate and improve the ideological and policy level of cadres.
    It must be clearly recognized that this rectification is mainly to solve the major central problems that urgently need to be solved in the current work of major enterprises, factories, organs, and groups, not to solve all problems. The main leading cadres of each department should first be responsible for raising the major issues related to the central link in their own units. To achieve that when solving the central problem, the problems surrounding the central problem can also be solved easily. At the same time, problems raised in the rectification, which can be solved immediately, should be solved immediately.
    In addition, it is necessary to establish a leading core organization for rectification, hold rectification meetings well, promote democracy, carry out self-criticism, and strengthen the leadership and inspection of rectification in various major work departments.

### 旅大人民日报社论号召  克服形式主义推进整风运动

　　旅大人民日报社论号召
    克服形式主义推进整风运动
    【本报讯】九月四日，东北旅大人民日报发表社论，号召将整风工作深入一步。社论总结了一个多月来旅大地区的整风情况，批判了运动中不切合实际的形式主义偏向，并提出改进办法。中共旅大区党委根据中央及东北局指示，于七月十二日发布整风计划后，即根据计划分别召开了四个专门问题的检查会议：工业生产检查会、区党委领导思想作风检查会、农业生产检查会、财经贸易工作检查会。与此同时，各市县、各企业部门也召集了整风会议。社论指出，目前阻碍整风运动深入一步的重大思想障碍是一般化、不切合实际的形式主义偏向，有些企业领导机关虽然一般的掌握了整风要结合生产的原则，但在检查工作之先，开动脑筋不够，未细密研究本单位究竟在生产上存在着什么主要问题；而是一般的平列的提出问题，问题的范围牵扯得很广，又缺少钻研分析与综合，因此检查就不能击中要害。
    有些人认为“只整工作不整思想”“不能解决问题”，检查工作不如检讨个人思想作风和生活问题“过瘾”；有些单位孤立的整关系，愈整愈不好。
    有些单位负责干部采取整上整下不整自己的方针，强调上级给他解决问题不够，强调客观困难，牢骚一大堆，对于该负的责任也不负。有些单位只检查一些日常事务工作，而不着重检查方针与政策的贯彻与执行情况。有些人不以文件的精神来进行批评和检查；又有些人机械搬运整风文件与上级指示，而不去考虑与自己的业务如何结合。还有少数单位不善于联系实际，停留在学文件钻名词上面。有的单位甚至观望等待，缺乏主动的有计划的进行，开会无准备，到时乱扯一顿，结果毫无成效。
    社论指出，产生偏差的基本原因是，包括区党委在内的各级领导上对中央、东北局指示的整风基本精神体会不足贯彻不够，及对下面缺乏深入的教育解释工作。
    为了纠正这些偏差和缺点，使整风运动向前发展并深入一步，社论提出如下改进办法：
    首先，各级领导干部必须继续研究中央及东北局历次整风指示及整风必读文件和各地经验。在主要领导机关中尤须向干部反复交待整风精神，使干部在思想上弄得很清楚，这样使整风运动能够完全符合于指示精神。各级领导上还须对于基本政策的执行情况加以分析综合，做出检讨，以便帮助干部提高政策水平，并使检查有所遵循。
    其次，为了克服空泛的不着实际的形式主义偏向，各企业各市县以上的党、政、工、团领导机关应对本部门本地区的工作情况进行典型的调查研究，以作到不是泛泛的提出问题。这样才能够联系群众、联系实际，提出主要问题，给以具体的分析与总结，提到政策原则高度，以便解决问题，推进工作，并教育与提高干部的思想政策水平。
    必须明确认识这次整风主要是为解决各主要企业、工厂、机关、团体当前工作中急待解决的重大中心问题，而不是解决所有问题。各部门主要领导干部应首先负责提出本单位内有关中心环节的重大问题。要做到在解决中心问题时，使环绕中心问题的诸问题也可以迎刃而解。同时在整风中提出的问题，凡能够马上解决的，就应该马上设法解决。
    此外要建立整风的领导核心组织，开好整风会议，发扬民主，开展自我批评及加强对各主要工作部门整风的领导与检查等。
