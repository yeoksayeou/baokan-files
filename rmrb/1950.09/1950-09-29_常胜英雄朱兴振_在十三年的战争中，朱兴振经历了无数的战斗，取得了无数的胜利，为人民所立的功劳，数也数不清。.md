　　The Ever-Victorious Hero Zhu Xingzhen
    In thirteen years of war, Zhu Xingzhen experienced countless battles, achieved countless victories, and made countless contributions to the people.
    Comrade Zhu Xingzhen, a combat hero, is the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of a certain unit of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army. He is thirty-five years old and comes from Zhujiazhuang, Changqing, Shandong Province. He was born into a poor peasant family and worked as a shop assistant in a restaurant. He joined the army in March 1938 and joined the Chinese Communist Party in the same year. Someone asked him: How many battles have you fought in the thirteen years of fighting from the Anti-Japanese War to now? How many merits have you achieved? How many awards have you received? The hero himself is not clear about these detailed figures. His old comrades-in-arms all remember that when he was a reconnaissance platoon leader, for a period of time, the towels, toothbrushes, soap and other daily necessities used by the whole platoon were all prizes he won for his meritorious service. He has received more than 30 awards; the honors he has received include titles such as "Lone Hero," "Combat Hero," and "Labor Hero," as well as the nickname "Soldier-Loving Chairman," given to him by the soldiers. These honors collectively summarize Zhu Xingzhen's characteristics in battle, and also summarize Zhu Xingzhen's characteristics in daily life.
    The reason why Comrade Zhu Xingzhen is like this is because of his consistent and infinite loyalty to the cause of people's liberation. He melted the Party's requirements and the people's interests into his blood, and thus produced a series of resolute, decisive, and heroic behaviors and amazing achievements, and was able to become an outstanding hero.
    In the arduous War of Resistance Against Japan, he more than once led scouts deep into strongholds to capture the enemy. That was shortly after he joined the army in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. He went to scout empty-handed and encountered enemy scouts on the levee of Linpu Market on the bank of the Yellow River. He kicked the enemy to the ground and snatched his pistol.
    In the thirteen years of war, Zhu Xingzhen has experienced countless battles and defeated countless enemies. Now let us look at how he won from a few famous battles.
    The Yuan Tang battle in Chengwu County in May 1940 was when Zhu Xingzhen was the deputy squad leader. At that time, we lacked heavy weapons, but the requirements of the mission were very urgent: we had to capture the enemy's strong bunker to resolve the battle. The company commander handed this task to the third platoon, and Comrade Zhu Xingzhen rushed to go.
    The third platoon leader went to see the terrain with him. There was only one alley that could approach the blockhouse. But the blockhouse was indeed too high, more than fifty meters away. At that time, any small artillery could solve the problem. But there was none! The only way was to use grenades, and if they were thrown up and fell down, they would hit themselves. Comrade Zhu Xingzhen brought forty-seven grenades. He threw twenty-three in one breath, and the machine gun inside stopped firing. The blockhouse was covered with a layer of white smoke, so our troops began to move. But after a while, the machine gun fired out of the second-floor window again. He then threw more up. When the last two grenades were thrown into the window, the enemy shouted, "Don't shoot, don't shoot, we surrender, we surrender!"
    In this battle, Comrade Zhu Xingzhen played a major role. Zhu Xingzhen's role in the battle was not limited to this time. He made the same contributions in the Jining Campaign, the Caolou Battle, and the Gongtang Battle in the Yutai Campaign.
    During the Jining Campaign, Zhu Xingzhen was the company commander of the Fourth Company. At that time, the higher-ups pointed out: Although the city is strong, victory lies in being able to break through quickly. The Fourth Company was given the glorious task of being the main attacking force.
    The day before, the suburbs were cleared, and the attack began the next day. Due to Zhu Xingzhen's meticulous deployment and decisive command, and personally leading the charge, he broke through the city wall in ten minutes. He seized an enemy machine gun on the crenel and developed it in depth, successively defeating the enemy's two counterattacks. At this time, the traitor commander personally led three or four hundred "martial arts teams" to reinforce the city from the street. These enemies were all equipped with three major pieces of equipment (one rifle, one pistol, and one broadsword), and the dark mass filled the street. At this time, Zhu Xingzhen only had three soldiers beside him. If a timid person hesitated slightly, he would be chopped down by the enemy, but Zhu Xingzhen's thinking was resolute and his actions were rapid. He rushed over and snatched the enemy commander's command knife. The commander screamed and ran backwards. His "martial arts team" all fled in a panic. At this time, a squad of follow-up troops arrived. In the middle of chasing the street, they ran into six Japanese soldiers. The heroes rushed over again, and after a burst of hand-to-hand combat, they seized the devils' guns. Then they continued to chase inside, squeezed the enemy to the northwest corner of the city, and ended the battle. Their company captured more than 600 people. The whole regiment captured more than 7,000. This battle took only a little over an hour from start to finish. Zhu Xingzhen won the glorious title of the second hero to climb the city.
    Soon after the Jining battle, the hero created new achievements and made new contributions in the Caolou battle.
    That was in May 1946. More than 2,000 puppet troops collected by Chiang Kai-shek attacked the liberated areas. These enemies built quite solid fortifications in Caolou, Fengxian County.
    That day, the First Battalion was the main attacking force. They fought for a day without breaking through. In the evening, the Fourth Company of the Second Battalion took over the main attacking task. The attack began in the dark. The enemy's crossfire was too dense, and the first and second groups of the assault squad were shot down. When Zhu Xingzhen personally led people to break through, only ten people were left in the whole platoon. After breaking through, the second echelon was cut off by fire and could not keep up. He sent three people to guard the breach, and led seven people to develop to the right wing along the city wall, sweeping and advancing with machine guns. Whenever they changed magazines, the enemy gathered a large force to charge at them. They repelled the enemy's five counterattacks in a row. The enemy's attack became more and more violent. In the last attack, the enemy's regimental commander rushed in front of him. A shot came over, and the bullet penetrated his chin and knocked down the communicator. He turned around, picked up the gun of the sacrificed comrade, and stabbed the enemy regimental commander outside the city wall with a bayonet. He did not expect that this was the key to resolving the battle: the enemy lost the commander who supervised the battle, and retreated with a crash. At this time, the second echelon had taken over, and a swift rush past ended the battle quickly.
    Zhu Xingzhen not only won victories in normal battles, but more importantly, he stood up in times of crisis, turned the tide, and won victories. This was most prominent in the Gongtang battle.
    At that time (1947), the 104th Brigade of the 70th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army gathered in Gongtang area outside Yutai, Shandong, and were stationed in three small villages. Our regiment launched an attack from three directions. The village attacked by the First Battalion was the enemy's small rear, and there was no major battle. The attack of the Third Battalion suffered setbacks and could not continue fighting. The main force of the enemy was concentrated in front of the Second Battalion. The task of the Fourth Company this time was to rush into the village as soon as the fighting started. The attack began in the middle of the night. The Fifth and Sixth Companies suffered heavy casualties and did not break through. The Fourth Company was also blocked by the enemy's fire at the edge of the deer village, only 30 meters away from the enemy's position, and there was no progress when dawn was approaching. Company Commander Zhu Xingzhen decided to dig fortifications on the spot and fight to the end resolutely. As soon as it was dug, it was already dawn. The enemy discovered the target and concentrated 30 light and heavy machine guns to cover a battalion of troops and rushed at them fiercely, but they were repelled. The second time the enemy used the despicable means of false surrender to seize the position, they were shot down again. At this time, only more than 60 people were left in the whole battalion. The battalion commander, instructor, and other main responsible cadres of each company had been wounded or killed. The enemy was organizing another charge, and the situation was extremely urgent. So, Zhu Xingzhen took off his cotton coat, bared his back, patted his chest, and called on everyone: "Now the whole battalion is under my command! Comrades! Resolutely eliminate the enemy and avenge our sacrificed comrades!" The hero organized the only 60 people, concentrated all the battalion's grenades and bayonets, and deployed them on the less than 30-meter-long position. Seeing that the enemy was about to rush over. This time it was nearly a regiment of troops. The enemy concentrated all its light and heavy weapons to shoot at their positions. A sea of fire had already been formed in front of them. But Zhu Xingzhen was calmer than ever. When the enemy rushed over, a burst of grenade explosions and bayonets pressed them back.
    They persisted like this until after twelve o'clock, when the enemy sent a adjutant, holding a white flag, to surrender to our army. (Attached picture)

　　常胜英雄朱兴振
    在十三年的战争中，朱兴振经历了无数的战斗，取得了无数的胜利，为人民所立的功劳，数也数不清。
    战斗英雄朱兴振同志，是人民解放军第二野战军某部三营营长。三十五岁，山东长清朱家庄人。贫农出身，当过饭店的小伙计。一九三八年三月入伍，同年参加中国共产党。有人问他：从抗日到现在，十三年的战斗中，打过多少次仗？立过多少功？得过多少奖？这些详细的数字，英雄自己也弄不清。他的老战友都记得：在他当侦察排长的时候，曾有一个时期全排人用的毛巾、牙刷、肥皂等日用品，都是他立功得来的奖品。他所受的奖励，在三十次以上；所获得的荣誉，有“孤胆英雄”，“战斗英雄”，和“劳动英雄”等称号，此外还有战士送他的绰号“爱兵委员长”。这些荣誉，集中地概括了朱兴振在战斗中的特色，同时也概括了朱兴振日常生活中的特色。
    朱兴振同志所以如此，是由于他对人民解放的事业，始终如一地无限忠诚。他把党的要求和人民的利益，溶化在他的心血里面，于是才产生了一连串的坚毅果敢的英勇行为和惊人的功绩，才能成为杰出的英雄。
    在艰苦的抗日战争中，他不止一次地带着侦察员深入据点里去抓出敌人。那是抗日战争初期，他参军不久的事。他空着手去侦察，在黄河边临濮集的大堤上和敌人的侦察遭遇了。他一脚踢倒了敌人，夺下了手枪。
    在十三年的战争中，朱兴振所经历的战斗，所打垮的敌人，是无数的。现在我们只从几个著名的战斗中，来看他是怎样胜利的。
    一九四○年五月的城武县袁堂战斗，是朱兴振担任副班长的时候。那时候，我们缺少重武器，但任务的要求很迫切：必须攻下敌人的坚固堡垒，才能解决战斗。连长把这个任务交给三排后，朱兴振同志就抢着去了。
    三排长和他一起去看地形。只有一个夹道可以接近炮楼。但炮楼确实太高了，相距足有五十米以上。当时要是有一门任何小炮都能解决问题。可是没有！唯一的办法只好用手榴弹，如果扔不上去落下来，就会打着自己。朱兴振同志带了四十七颗手榴弹。一口气摔上去二十三个，里面的机枪不响了，炮楼外面罩了一层白烟，于是我们部队开始运动。但过一会机枪又从第二层窗眼里往外打。他随即再往上摔。最后两个手榴弹摔进窗口的时候，敌人就嚷起来了：“别打了，别打了，我们缴枪，我们缴枪！”
    这次战斗，朱兴振同志是起了重大作用的。朱兴振在战斗中所起的这种作用，并不止这一次。他在济宁战役、曹楼战斗和鱼台战役的巩堂战斗中，都立了同样的功劳。
    济宁战役时，朱兴振是四连连长。当时上级指出：城虽坚固，但能迅速突上去就是胜利。四连得到了光荣的主攻任务。
    头一天扫清了城关，第二天就开始攻击。由于朱兴振部署的精密和指挥的果决，并且亲自带领冲锋，十分钟就突上了城墙。他在垛口上夺了敌人一挺机枪，就往纵深发展，又接连着打垮了敌人两次反扑。这时汉奸司令亲自带领着三四百名“武术队”，从街里冲出来增援。这伙敌人都是三大件装备（一长枪一短枪一大刀），黑压压的塞满了街筒子。此时朱兴振身边只剩三个战士。要是胆怯的人，稍一犹豫就会被敌人砍倒，可是朱兴振的思想坚决，行动迅速，扑过去就夺下了敌司令的指挥刀。那位司令惊叫一声就往后跑。他的“武术队”都随着一哄逃跑了。这时候后续部队赶来了一个班。正向街里追击的中间，迎面碰上了六个日本人。英雄们又扑过去，经过一阵肉搏，夺下了鬼子的枪。接着再往里追，把敌人挤到城西北角解决了战斗。他们这个连，捉到六百多人。全团俘虏了七千多。这个战斗从开始到结束，只用了一点多钟的时间。朱兴振获得了第二名登城英雄的光荣称号。
    接着济宁战后不久，英雄又在曹楼战斗中创造了新的战绩，立下了新的功劳。
    那是一九四六年五月。蒋匪收罗的伪军共两千多人，向解放区进攻。这伙敌人在丰县曹楼构筑了相当坚固的工事。
    那天是第一营主攻。打了一天没打进去。晚上，二营四连把主攻任务接过来了。天黑开始攻击，敌人的交叉火力太密，突击班第一、二两组都打下来了。朱兴振亲自带人突上去的时候，全排已剩十个人。而突上去后，第二梯队又被火力隔绝，跟不上来。他派三个人守住突破口，带着七个人顺城墙往右翼发展，用机枪一面扫一面前进。每当他们换梭子时，敌人就集结强大兵力向他们冲锋。他们接连打退了敌人五次反扑。敌人越扑越剧烈，最后一次，敌人的团长冲到他面前，一枪射过来，子弹穿透了他的下巴，把通讯员打倒了。他转身拿起牺牲同志的枪，上前一刺刀把敌人团长挑到城墙外面去了。他没想到这就是解决战斗的关键：敌人失掉了督战的指挥官，哗地一声退了下去。这时第二梯队已接上来，一个猛冲过去，战斗很快地结束了。
    朱兴振不但在一般正常的战斗中取得胜利，更重要的品质是：临危的时候挺身而出，挽回危局取得胜利。这一点，在巩堂战斗中表现得最突出。
    当时（一九四七年）蒋匪七十师的一零四旅集结在山东鱼台外围巩堂一带，分驻在三个小村上。我们一个团，从三个方向展开攻击。第一营攻的村子是敌人的小后方，没有什么大战。三营的攻击受到了挫折，不能继续战斗。敌人的主力都集中在二营的面前。这次四连的任务是：一打响就往村里冲。半夜开始攻击。五六连的伤亡很重，没有突上去。四连也被敌人的火力阻止在鹿砦边上，离敌人阵地只三十米，天快亮还没有进展。朱兴振连长决定就地挖工事，坚决打到底。刚挖好，天已明了。敌人发现了目标，就集中三十挺轻重机枪掩护一个营的兵力向他们猛冲，但被他们打退了。第二次敌人用假投降的卑鄙手段来夺阵地，又被他们打下去了。这时全营只剩下六十多人。营长教导员及其他各连的主要负责干部都已伤亡。敌人又在组织冲锋，情况万分紧急。于是，朱兴振脱掉棉衣，光着脊梁，拍起胸脯向大家号召：“现在全营归我指挥！同志们！坚决消灭敌人为我们牺牲的同志报仇！”英雄把仅有的六十人组织好了，把全营的手榴弹刺刀集中起来，在不满三十米长的阵地上部署开。眼看敌人就要冲来了。这次是将近一个团的兵力。敌人用所有的轻重武器集中地向他们阵地射击。他们面前已打成一片火海。可是朱兴振比任何时候都沉着镇定。等敌人冲来，一阵手榴弹的爆炸和刺刀给压回去了。
    就这样坚持到十二点钟以后，敌人派出一个副官，举着白旗，向我军投降。（附图片）
