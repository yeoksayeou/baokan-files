　　Shanghai Housewives Fight for Peace
　　By our reporter Cheng Guangrui
　　Hating wars of aggression and loving peace – the hearts of all mothers and wives around the world are the same. Among these good people, countless have lost their loved ones and the happiness of their families in war. Therefore, they understand the value of peace the most and participate most bravely in the struggle for world peace.
　　Starting in May, the signature campaign to defend world peace unfolded enthusiastically in Shanghai. The people of Shanghai, with great enthusiasm, plunged into the tide of defending world peace. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, more than 3,000 members of the family women's federations in the city's nine districts participated in the work of collecting peace signatures with courageous and selfless actions. They became a powerful force in this movement. In this movement, they gave full play to their initiative and creativity, mobilizing 270,000 people to sign the Stockholm Appeal.
　　In June, the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Women's Federation responded to the call of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace and launched two signature collection campaigns for peace. In order to do a good job, the family women's federations in various districts first combined publicity work with daily work to widely launch the signature campaign: some mobilized family members to sign through literacy class students, some mobilized relatives and friends to sign through production team members, and some mobilized cooperative members and customers to sign through cooperatives. A total of 100,000 organized and unorganized citizens' signatures were collected in the two campaigns.
　　During the "July 1st" to "July 7th" Peace Signature Movement Week, Shanghai's peace signature movement entered a climax. Members of the family women's federations cooperated with the staff and students of various districts, strengthened publicity work, continued to deeply mobilize unorganized citizens to sign, and achieved good results. Before the start of the Movement Week, the family women's federations in various districts held mobilization meetings to educate the members, so that they understood the great significance of the peace signature work, and solved some questions that they might encounter in their work that were not easy to answer. They divided the districts with other groups in the district, and first conducted collective publicity in large groups of one or two hundred people, using Yangko teams, waist drum teams, costume performances, and speeches to expand the publicity impact, and then divided into small groups of a dozen people or individuals, went deep into the alleys, shantytowns, vegetable markets, docks, public places, and every corner, door to door, to collect signatures.
　　In the hot summer and in the rainy south, they often braved the scorching sun and heavy rain, running around all day long, from the city to the countryside, from the streets to the alleys; temporarily putting aside their children and housework, for this glorious task – collecting peace signatures, they demonstrated a high degree of work enthusiasm and worked tirelessly. Zhang Zhen, a mother of six children, joined the upsurge of the peace signature movement on the third day after she joined the family women's federation, and collected more than 4,000 signatures on her own. The famous peace fighter Zhang Liping, whose mother and husband were tortured to death by the old society, and whose brother died in the civil war launched by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, now only has herself left in her family; her miserable life makes her love peace and love working for the happiness of mankind. She had only joined the family women's federation for two weeks when she participated in the work of collecting peace signatures. She often ran around alone from morning to night, and sometimes felt that her strength was not enough, so she mobilized others to help her carry out the work; she often encountered difficulties in her work, and she sometimes debated seriously and sometimes patiently persuaded, using moving words and sincere feelings to win others over to sign. The outstanding achievement of mobilizing more than 2,200 people to sign demonstrates her selfless and tenacious spirit in her work. In this movement, there were many, many more Shanghai housewives who showed this admirable spirit. Jin Huijuan, a member of the Hunan District, insisted on working every day, rain or shine, holding her nine-month-old nursing child. Li Jingwan, a 56-year-old woman in the Changjing District, ran around all day in the scorching sun, forgetting her fatigue. On July 4, when the Hunan District Branch conducted publicity on the street, the propagandists Yu Huiying, Yang Huifang, Xie Jianhui, and Xu Shimei were injured by sabotage elements throwing concentrated sulfuric acid, but the concentrated sulfuric acid did not frighten them back. On the contrary, it inspired their work enthusiasm and made them realize the importance of the peace signature work even more. After bandaging their wounds, they bravely continued to persevere in their work.
　　The people love peace. As long as they understand the meaning of peace signatures, they will sign their names on the peace declaration without hesitation. Therefore, propagandists should often carry out patient persuasion work for them. They explain why we oppose the US imperialists' war of aggression against Korea, why we support the Korean people's war of liberation, and our just war to liberate Taiwan. They forcefully prove that the unemployment caused by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang launching the sinful civil war can only be eliminated in the future peaceful construction. They often spend tens of minutes or even two or three hours on persuasion and explanation. They know that people cannot patiently listen to what you have to say when they are too busy. Therefore, they have to seize the time, mostly using the time in the evening when everyone is enjoying the cool air outside the door, or holding cool-air evening parties in the alleys for collective publicity, or conducting individual publicity to each person enjoying the cool air. The two groups of Zhou Yichi and Li Zhuqing, members of the North Hong District, collected more than 4,000 signatures because they were good at controlling their time. He Tianning, a staff member of the Xiangyang South Road Street Branch in Changjing District, had to attend a meeting every day at nine o'clock in the morning, so she used the one hour from eight o'clock to nine o'clock to collect signatures near her home. If she didn't have time herself, she entrusted the shops, barbershops, and dim sum shops she knew well to collect signatures from customers. Wu Huizheng, another member of the Xiangyang South Road Branch, used the time she spent buying vegetables in the small vegetable market in the morning to collect signatures from the vegetable buyers and sellers, went to the racecourse to collect signatures from people visiting the maternity and infant exhibition, and went to the shantytown along the river in Xujiahui to collect signatures. As a result, she collected 2,000 signatures on her own.
　　People who have suffered greatly in war are the most enthusiastic signatories. The indelible memory of pain makes them resolutely support world peace. In a family in the Hunan District, a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law lost their son and husband in the Japanese war of aggression against China. The war brought them poverty, and now they are picking up garbage to make a living. When the propagandists asked them to sign the peace signature, they couldn't help but shed tears and wrote their names on the peace declaration. When the Twelfth Group of the Hubei District was collecting signatures on Shanhai Pass Road, they talked about family affairs with a woman named Yu Caifen. Yu Caifen talked about her husband being arrested by the Chiang bandit army when they fled Shanghai, and his life and death are still unknown. The propagandists comforted her, saying that we must liberate Taiwan. When Taiwan is liberated, your husband will be found. Yu Caifen's eyes were filled with tears. While wiping her tears, she signed her name without hesitation. The peace signature book was filled with the tears of these people who had suffered in the war and lost their happiness.
　　Through this peace signature movement, the family women's federations have developed their own organizations, and many women who have signed have joined the family women's federations. In these extensive and in-depth publicity works, their connection with the masses has been further strengthened. The propagandists' work enthusiasm deeply moved the good people, and many people joined their ranks to help with the publicity. The members of the family women's federations have improved themselves in this movement, cultivated their own work, and strengthened their confidence in carrying out publicity work. They have all been trained to become good propagandists. Peace fighter Zhang Liping often encountered people asking her questions in her work. For example, someone asked her why we should support the Korean people's war. She would say to them: "If your hand is burned by fire, does your heart hurt? Sisters and brothers all over the world are one family, and ten fingers are connected to the heart!" She often said to those who did not quite understand the meaning of the peace signature: "Signing a name is a force that will make the warmongers afraid. A single chopstick can be broken, but a bundle of chopsticks cannot be broken. It must take the strength of many people to prevent the warmongers from launching wars of aggression."
　　These propagandists who have worked hard in the peace signature movement and have been trained in this movement continue to exert their work enthusiasm and strength in the Anti-American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Movement Week, going deep into all levels of citizens, creating various forms of publicity: using forums, costume performances, mobile publicity, casual talks, seminars and other forms that have proved very effective in past work, to carry out anti-aggression publicity, so that people understand and rise up to oppose the US imperialists' sinful actions of aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and further recognize the significance of defending world peace.
　　Now, the housewives of Shanghai have once again been swept into the hot movement of supporting the liberation of Taiwan and making one million pairs of military shoes for the soldiers. In Zhang Liping's home and in the Xiangyang South Road branch, I saw everyone working hard to make military shoes. The family women's federations in various districts are enthusiastically promoting this huge movement.
　　Defending world peace, opposing US aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and supporting the liberation of Taiwan, this series of movements has unfolded successively in Shanghai in full swing. Shanghai housewives have contributed all their strength in these movements for the happiness of all mankind and lasting peace.

　　上海家庭妇女为和平而斗争
    本报记者  程光锐
    憎恨侵略战争，热爱和平——全世界一切母亲和妻子们的心是一样的。在这些良善的人们中间，曾有无数人在战争中失掉了自己的亲人和家庭的幸福，因此，她们最懂得和平的可贵，最勇敢地参加了争取世界和平的斗争。
    五月起，保卫世界和平签名运动在大上海热烈展开，全上海市的人民以巨大的热情卷入保卫世界和平的浪潮中。在上海市民主妇联领导下，全市九个区家庭妇联的三千多会员们，以勇敢的、忘我的行动，参加了征集和平签名的工作。她们成了这个运动中一支有力的队伍。在这个运动中，她们充分发挥了积极性和创造性，动员了二十七万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。
    六月里，上海市民主妇联响应了中国保卫世界和平大会委员会上海分会的号召，发动两次征集和平签名的工作。各区家庭妇联为了把工作做好，首先把宣传工作和日常工作结合起来，广泛发动签名：有的通过识字班学生发动家属签名，有的通过生产组组员发动亲友签名，有的通过合作社发动社员和顾客签名。两次共征集了有组织和无组织的市民十万人的签名。
    “七一”到“七七”和平签名运动周期间，上海的和平签名运动进入了高潮。家庭妇联的会员们配合各区的工作人员，学生，加强宣传工作，继续深入发动无组织市民签名，获得了良好的成绩。运动周开始前，各区家庭妇联都开了动员大会，向会员们进行教育，使他们明了和平签名工作的重大意义，并解决一些在工作中可能遇到而不易回答的问题，她们和区里的其他团体划分地区，首先由一二百人的大组进行集体宣传，利用秧歌队、腰鼓队、化装表演和演讲等方式，扩大宣传影响，然后再分成十几个人的小组或是个人，深入里弄、棚户、菜场、码头、公共场所和各个角落，挨家挨户，征集签名。
    在炎热的夏季里，在多雨的南方，她们常常冒着烈日和大雨，整日奔走，从城市到乡村，从街头到里弄；暂时放下孩子，丢下家务，为着这个光荣的任务——征集和平签名，她们发挥了高度的工作热忱，不倦地工作着。六个孩子的母亲张真，她在参加家庭妇联后的第三天，就投入和平签名运动的热潮中，一个人征集了四千多人的签名。著名的和平战士张丽屏，她的母亲和丈夫被旧社会折磨死去了，她的哥哥在蒋介石匪帮发动的内战中死去了，现在她家里只剩自己一个人；她的悲苦的身世使她热爱和平，热爱为人类谋取幸福而工作。她加入家庭妇联也只两个星期，就参加征集和平签名的工作。她常常从早到晚，一个人奔走，有时感到力量不足，就发动别人帮助她进行工作；她常常在工作中遇到困难，她有时严肃地辩论，有时耐心地说服，以动人的话语和真挚的感情争取别人签名。动员了二千二百多人签名的卓越成绩，说明了她在工作中忘我的和坚毅的精神。在这个运动中，上海的家庭妇女们表现了这种可佩的精神的，还有许多许多，沪南区的会员金慧娟，每天抱着九个月的吃奶的孩子，风雨无阻的坚持工作。常静区的李静婉，一位五十六岁的老大姐，整日奔走在烈日下，忘记了疲倦，七月四日沪南区分会在街头进行宣传时，宣传员虞慧英、杨慧芳、谢建晖和徐士梅四人，被破坏分子投掷浓硫酸而受了伤，但是浓硫酸并没有吓退她们，相反的，更激发了她们的工作热忱，和更使她们认识了和平签名工作的重要，她们在包扎好伤口后，仍然勇敢的继续坚持工作。
    人民是爱好和平的，只要他们了解和平签名的意义，他们就会毫不迟疑地在和平宣言上签上了自己的名字。因此，宣传员们就应该经常对他们进行耐心的说服工作。她们解释为什么我们反对美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的战争，为什么我们支援朝鲜人民解放战争和我们解放台湾的正义战争。她们有力地证明由于蒋介石匪帮发动罪恶的内战而造成的失业现象，只有在今后的和平建设中才能消除。她们常常用几十分钟甚至两三个钟头的时间进行说服和解释的工作。她们知道人们在太忙的时间，是不能耐心听你讲说什么的。因此她们就不得不抓紧时间，大多利用晚上大家在门外纳凉的时间，或是在里弄开纳凉晚会进行集体宣传，或是向每个纳凉的人进行个别宣传。北虹区会员周以茞和李竹青的两个小组，就是因为善于控制时间，征集了四千多人的签名。常静区襄阳南路街道支会工作人员何天宁，她每天早晨九点就要开会，她就利用八点到九点一个钟头的时间在她的家附近征集签名，自己没有时间，就托自己熟识的商店、理发店、点心铺向顾客征集签名。襄阳南路支会的另一个会员吴慧征利用早晨在小菜场买菜的时间向买菜卖菜的征集签名，到跑马厅向参观妇婴展览会的人征集签名，到徐家汇沿河棚户区去征集签名，结果一个人征集了二千人的签名。
    在战争中饱受痛苦的人们，他们是最热心的签名者。不可磨灭的痛苦的记忆，使他们坚决地拥护世界和平。沪南区一家婆媳二人，在日寇侵华战争中子散夫亡，战争给她们带来了贫困，现在在拾垃圾度日，当宣传员向她们征集和平签名时，她们不禁流下泪来，在和平宣言上写上了自己的名字。沪中区十二大组在山海关路进行签名时，和一位名叫俞彩芬的妇女谈起家常，俞彩芬谈起她的丈夫被蒋匪军在逃出上海时抓去，至今生死不明。宣传员安慰她，说我们一定要解放台湾，台湾解放了，你的丈夫就会有下落了。俞彩芬眼睛里含着泪光，一边擦着眼泪，一边毫不迟疑地签上了自己的名字。和平签名书上沾满了这些在战争中遭受痛苦、失掉幸福的人们的眼泪。
    通过这次和平签名运动，家庭妇联发展了自己的组织，许多签了名的妇女都参加了家庭妇联。在这些广泛深入的宣传工作中，更加强了她们和群众的联系。宣传员的工作热忱深深地感动了善良的人们，很多人都参加了她们的队伍，帮助宣传。家庭妇联的会员们，在这一运动中提高了自己，培养了自己的工作，加强进行宣传工作的信心，她们都锻炼成了一个很好的宣传员。和平战士张丽屏常常在工作中遇到人们向她提出问题，例如有人问她我们为什么要支援朝鲜人民战争，她就对他们说：“你的手叫火烫了，你的心痛不痛？全世界姊妹兄弟都是一家人，十个指头连着心！”他常常对那些不太了解和平签名的意义的人们说：“签一个名就是一份力量，就会使战争贩子们害怕。一支筷子咬得断，一束筷子咬不断。一定要有许多人的力量，才能阻止战争贩子发动侵略战争。”
    这些在和平签名运动中努力工作，并在这个运动中锻炼出来的宣传员们，在反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜运动周中，继续发挥自己的工作热忱和力量，深入各阶层市民，创造各种宣传形式：利用辩论会、化装表演、流动宣传、漫谈、座谈等在过去工作中收效很大的形式，进行反侵略宣传，使人们了解并起而反对美帝国主义者侵略台湾朝鲜的罪恶行动，更进一步地认识保卫世界和平的意义。
    现在，全上海市的家庭妇女又卷入支援解放台湾、为战士们赶做一百万双军鞋的火热的运动中。我在张丽屏家中和襄阳南路的支会里，看到她们每人都在紧张地做军鞋，各区的家庭妇联，正在热烈推动这个巨大的运动。
    保卫世界和平，反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜，支援解放台湾，这一连串的运动如火如荼地在全上海市先后展开。上海的家庭妇女在这些运动中贡献了自己全部的力量，为了全人类的幸福和持久的和平。
