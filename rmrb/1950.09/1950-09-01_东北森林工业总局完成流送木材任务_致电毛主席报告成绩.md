Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd: The Northeast Forest Industry Bureau's plan to raft (note: meaning transport by water) 1.88 million cubic meters of timber this year was basically completed in mid-August. Starting in mid-April this year, the bureau's various forest areas used 53 large and small rivers in the Songhua River, Mudan River, and Yalu River systems to raft timber, lasting a total of four months, two months shorter than last year's rafting time. Compared with the same period last year, rafting efficiency increased by more than three times, and the timber loss rate was also below the national standard of 3%. To this end, all forestry employees of the bureau recently cabled Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government and Chairman Gao Gang, Vice Chairmen Li Fuchun, Lin Feng, and Gao Chongmin of the Northeast People's Government to report their achievements, and pledged that the Northeast's forestry production work for the next year will be improved on the existing basis.
