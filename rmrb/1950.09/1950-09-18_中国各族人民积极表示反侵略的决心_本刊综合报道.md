　　Chinese People of All Nationalities Actively Express Their Determination to Resist Aggression
    --Comprehensive Report by This Journal
    Since launching its armed aggression against Korea, American imperialism has increasingly moved towards fascist war. World peace is facing a grave threat. Under such circumstances, across our vast land, a surge of defending world peace and opposing American aggression has swept like wildfire. People of all nationalities, whether they live in central cities or the most remote areas, have unanimously and enthusiastically signed the Stockholm Appeal to defend world peace, expressing their determination to oppose the criminal acts of American aggression. More than three thousand Hui people in Beijing held a grand meeting on July 8th and signed the peace appeal, including more than fifty people who came by cart from the western suburbs of Lan Dian Chang, thirty miles away. Wang Lianru, a Hui woman in her fifties from the fourth district of Xi'an, exhausted all means and, together with another woman, Shi Caiping, mobilized more than 3,000 people to sign. Peace signature campaigns have been launched in all banners, districts, and villages of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 500,000 people of all nationalities in the region have signed, accounting for 22.33% of the total population. In the five districts of Tumote Banner in Suiyuan alone, more than 4,000 Mongolian people signed in both Mongolian and Chinese languages. Of the 1,483,528 signatories in Xinjiang Province, the Uyghur people account for about 70%. In the Yili region of the province, the number of signatories in the twelve counties under its jurisdiction has exceeded half of the population, including people from thirteen nationalities, who signed the peace declaration in various languages. On June 8th, people of thirteen nationalities in Yining City held a peace signature campaign rally attended by more than 10,000 people, followed by a demonstration. On that day alone, more than 15,000 people of various nationalities in the city signed. Tibetan compatriots expressed their determination to safeguard world peace with practical actions to support the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet. Zha Xi, a Tibetan representative from Qinghai, representing the Tibetan people, supported world peace, saying that the Tibetan people should unite with all nationalities to jointly stop wars of aggression, strive to develop agriculture and animal husbandry to increase the prosperity of the motherland, and actively support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and Tibet. Miao compatriots in the deep mountains of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Fujian, as well as Fan people in Maoxian County, Sichuan, have also signed the peace declaration.
    The peace signature campaign in China is an unprecedented nationwide movement. All kinds of people, regardless of religious beliefs, whether Buddhists, Lamaists, Muslims, or Christians, enthusiastically participated in the peace signature campaign, for a common belief and desire: "Oppose wars of aggression, defend world peace!" According to preliminary statistics from the Beijing Buddhist Study Group, the group has received signatures from more than 9,250 Buddhists from all over the country. By the end of June, more than 400 nuns and monks in Wuhan had signed. Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province, took the opportunity of the Kumbum Monastery scripture observation festival to convene a conference to support the world peace signature campaign, and many people participated in the signing on the spot. The Panchen Erdeni and Khenpos of Kumbum Monastery also signed. Lamas from more than ten monasteries in Guisui City held a meeting to support peace at Xilitu Monastery, where more than 220 lamas signed on the spot, using Mongolian, Chinese, and Tibetan to write their names. In Ningxia, Hui religious leaders in Yinchuan, Tongxin, and other counties used the "Juma" prayer day to explain the significance of peace signatures and mobilize the Hui masses to sign. When the upsurge of peace signatures spread throughout Gansu Province, it coincided with the Hui people's "Juma" day (July 7th). Religious followers from various mosques went to the mosques to sign. Dongfang Temple and Nanfang Temple in Guyuan County translated the peace declaration into Arabic and attached it to the signature book. The mosques also used the most precious Qadr Night of Ramadan to recite scriptures with the masses to pray for lasting world peace. Many religious organizations in various places not only mobilized their believers to sign but also mobilized people from all walks of life to sign to defend world peace. The YMCA in Beijing, Shanghai, Changsha, and other places mobilized many people to sign the peace declaration.
    The signatories to the peace declaration also included people from various democratic parties. Organizations of democratic parties in various places not only mobilized their own party members or members to sign but also actively mobilized people from all walks of life to sign. In Chongqing alone, democratic parties and people's organizations mobilized more than 100,000 people to sign. Zeng Mengshi, a member of the China Democratic National Construction Association in the city, mobilized 8,834 people to sign on his own. The Pingliang branch of the China Democratic League in Gansu sent a telegram to the China Peace Committee stating: "Our entire League members in Pingliang will widely connect with tens of millions of people, closely unite under the banner of defending world peace, and use practical actions to defend peace."
    Compatriots in Hong Kong have also enthusiastically launched a peace signature campaign. Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po in Hong Kong have received more than 33,800 signatures from compatriots from all walks of life. Overseas Chinese have also signed. 102 Chinese students in the UK have signed.
    The consistent and active actions of the Chinese people in the struggle to defend world peace have demonstrated unprecedented unity and immense power in striving for peace. At present, the number of peace signatures nationwide has reached 105,790,118, accounting for 21.81% of the national population. This nationwide peace signature figure represents the firm will of people of all nationalities, believers of all religions, and people from all democratic parties to defend world peace, which is a powerful demonstration to the imperialist warmongers.

    美国帝国主义自从发动对朝鲜的武装侵略以来，日益走向法西斯战争。世界和平正面临着严重的威胁。在这样的情势之下，我国辽阔的土地上，到处如火燎原地卷起了保卫世界和平反对美国侵略的热潮。各族人民不论他们是住在中心的大城市或是最边远的地区，都一致热烈地在保卫世界和平的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，表示反对美国侵略罪行的决心。北京三千余回族人民在七月八日举行的盛大集会上都举行和平签名，其中有五十余人是从三十里外的西郊蓝靛厂乘坐着大车赶来参加的。西安四区五十多岁的回民妇女王莲如，她想尽了各种办法和另一个妇女史彩萍共同发动了三千多人签名。内蒙古自治区各旗、区、村都已展开了和平签名运动。全区各族人民已有五十万人签名，占人口总数的百分之二十二点三三。绥远土默特旗五个区即有四千余蒙族人民用蒙汉两种文字签名。新疆省一百四十八万三千五百二十八个签名者中，维吾尔族人民约占百分之七十左右。该省伊犁区所属十二个县的四十余万人中，签名人数已超过人口半数，其中包括十三个民族的人民，他们以各种不同的文字在和平宣言上签名。伊宁市十三个民族的人民于六月八日举行了有万余人参加的和平签名运动大会，会后并举行了游行示威，仅这一天内，全市即有各种民族的一万五千余人签名。藏族同胞表示要以支援解放台湾和西藏的实际行动来保卫世界和平。青海藏族人士扎喜代表藏族人民拥护世界和平，他表示：藏族人民要和各族人民团结在一起，来共同制止侵略战争；并要努力发展农牧业来增加祖国的富强，积极支援人民解放军解放台湾和西藏。云南、贵州、福建等地深山的苗胞，以及四川茂县等地的番族人民等，也都已有不少人在和平宣言上签了名。
    和平签名运动在中国是一次空前规模的全民性运动。各种各样的人们不分宗教的信仰，不论是佛教徒、喇嘛教徒、回教徒，还是基督教徒，都踊跃参加和平签名，为着一个共同的信念与愿望：“反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平！”据北京佛教徒学习会的初步统计，该会收到全国各地佛教徒的签名已有九千二百五十余人。武汉市的尼姑、和尚在六月底即已有四百多人签名。青海湟中县利用塔尔寺观经盛会的机会，召开拥护世界和平签名运动大会，当场即有不少人参加签名。塔尔寺的班禅额尔德尼和堪布们也都已签名。归绥市十余处召庙喇嘛在席勒图召举行拥护和平大会，会上有二百二十余个喇嘛当场签名，除用蒙汉文签名外，并有用藏文写上他们名字的。宁夏银川、同心等县的回民教长利用“主玛”聚礼日讲解和平签名的意义，并发动回民群众签名。当和平签名的热潮在甘肃省各地展开时，正逢回民的“主玛”日（七月七日），各寺教民纷纷到寺内签名，固原县东坊寺和南坊寺并把和平宣言译成阿文附在签名册上。各寺并以斋月中最宝贵的歌德蕾夜会同群众诵经祈祷世界永久和平。各地的许多宗教团体不但发动了教徒签名，并发动各族各界人民签名保卫世界和平。北京、上海、长沙等地基督教青年会都发动了很多人在和平宣言上签名。
    在和平宣言上签名的并包括了各民主党派的人士。各地民主党派的组织不但发动了自己的党员或会员签名，并且积极动员各界人民签名。仅重庆市各民主党派协同各人民团体发动签名的即有十万余人。该市民主建国会会员曾梦石一个人发动了八千八百三十四人签名。中国民主同盟甘肃平凉支部临时工作委员会致电中国和大说：“我们平凉全体盟员，定将广泛地联系成千万的群众，紧密地团结在保卫世界和平的旗帜下，用实际行动来保卫和平。”
    香港的同胞也都热烈展开和平签名运动，香港大公、文汇两报已收到各界同胞的签名三万三千八百余个。海外的华侨也都签名。留英的中国学生已有一百零二人签名。
    中国人民在保卫世界和平斗争中的一致积极行动，显示了为争取和平的空前团结和无比强大的力量。目前全国和平签名人数已达一亿零五百七十九万零一百一十八人，占全国人口百分之二十一点八一。这一个全国和平签名的数字代表着各民族的人民、各宗教的信徒、各民主党派人士保卫世界和平的坚强意志，对于帝国主义的战争贩子来说，也就是一种有力的示威。
