Xinhua News Agency, Successful Lake Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held consecutive plenary sessions on the 25th and 26th. The 25th session continued the general debate. After the 26th session spent most of its time reviewing the General Committee's report on the agenda, it also conducted a general debate.

During the General Assembly's review of the General Committee's report on the 26th, thanks to the persistent struggle of the Soviet Union and representatives of the People's Democratic countries, the Kuomintang representative's proposal to withdraw the Soviet Union's "Accusation of US Aggression Against China" case from the agenda was rejected. However, with the United States repeatedly starting its voting machine, the General Assembly, disregarding the solemn opposition of the Soviet Union and representatives of the People's Democratic countries, still passed the inclusion of many purely slanderous and illegal proposals previously passed in the General Committee on the agenda, including: the Kuomintang's "Accusation Against the Soviet Union" case, which smears the Soviet Union and the Chinese people, and the so-called "threat" to Greek independence case, which attempts to divert people's attention from the fascist terror rule in Greece. In addition, the General Assembly also approved the General Committee's recommendations on allocating proposals to various committees and establishing a special political committee.

At the 25th session, British representative Bevin falsely claimed: "The current General Assembly must find a way to resolve the issue of Chinese representation." However, it is well known that it was the British delegation headed by Bevin that abstained from voting on the Soviet Union's proposal to expel the Kuomintang's illegal representatives at the opening meeting of the General Assembly on the 19th, and voted against the Soviet Union's proposal not to recognize the credentials of the Kuomintang's illegal representatives at the General Assembly's Credentials Committee on the 22nd. In his speech, Bevin praised the United States' aggressive actions in Korea and claimed that he fully agreed with Acheson's suggestion to undermine the purpose of the United Nations Charter, demanding that the General Assembly review it as soon as possible. At the same time, he openly opposed the peace plan proposed by the Soviet Union.

Pakistani representative Zafrulla Khan pointed out in his speech on the 25th that the United Nations should consider the actual situation in China and invite the delegation of the People's Republic of China to attend the current General Assembly. At the same time, he supported the US intervention in Korea in his speech.

Yugoslav Tito clique representative Kardelj's speech on the 25th was filled with the most vulgar slanders against the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He cited the example of Yugoslav diplomatic representatives engaged in espionage being expelled from the People's Democratic countries to prove his fabricated slander that the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries were preparing to invade Yugoslavia, but dared not mention the fact that their sabotage and espionage activities had been uncovered. In order to curry favor with the United States, he did not hesitate to slander the military actions of the Korean people against US aggression as "not beneficial to the cause of genuine independence and unification of the Korean people." He obsequiously begged the United States to approve the so-called economic assistance to Yugoslavia as a backward country.

Representatives from Dominica, the Kuomintang, the Union of South Africa, Cuba, Bolivia, Turkey, the Philippines, El Salvador, Sweden, Colombia, and other countries also spoke at the plenary sessions on the 25th and 26th. Most of them repeated the hackneyed tune of attacking the principle of unanimity among the great powers. Cuba, Turkey, and the Philippines openly supported the US proposal, while Sweden stated that it would give it "careful consideration."

　　联大全会上苏联坚持斗争
    国民党图撤销“控美侵略案”已失败
    美国开动表决机器将许多非法诽谤案列入议程
    【新华社二十八日讯】成功湖消息：联合国大会于二十五日及二十六日连续举行全体会议。二十五日会议继续进行一般辩论。二十六日会议在以大部分时间审议总务委员会关于议程的报告以后，又进行一般辩论。
    全会在二十六日审议总务委员会报告时，由于苏联及人民民主国家代表的坚持斗争，否决了国民党代表企图将苏联所提“控诉美国侵略中国”案自议程上撤销的提议。但是在美国一再开动其表决机器的情形下，大会不顾苏联及人民民主国家代表的严正反对，仍然通过将前在总务委员会上通过的许多纯属诽谤的非法议案列入议程，其中包括：国民党污蔑苏联及中国人民的“控苏案”，以及企图转移人们对希腊法西斯恐怖统治注意的所谓“威胁”希腊独立案等等。此外大会也通过了总务委员会关于分配议案予各委员会以及成立特别政治委员会的建议。
    在二十五日会上，英国代表贝文曾发言佯称：“目前的大会必须设法解决中国代表权问题。”但是举世周知，正是以贝文为首的英国代表团在十九日大会开幕会议上对苏联所提驱逐国民党非法代表的提案表示弃权，又在二十二日大会全权证书委员会上对苏联所提不承认国民党非法代表的全权证书的提案投反对票。贝文在发言中盛赞美国在朝鲜的侵略行动，并声称完全赞成艾奇逊建议破坏联合国宪章的目的，要求大会尽速加以审议，同时，他也公开反对苏联提出的和平方案。
    巴基斯坦代表查布鲁拉在二十五日的发言中指出，联合国应考虑中国的实际情况，邀请我中华人民共和国代表团出席目前的大会。同时他在发言中支持美国干涉朝鲜。
    南斯拉夫铁托集团代表卡德尔二十五日在会上的发言，充满了对苏联、各人民民主国家与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最粗野的诬蔑。他引证进行间谍活动的南斯拉夫外交代表被人民民主国家驱逐出境的事例，来证明他捏造的所谓苏联和人民民主国家正在准备侵略南斯拉夫的谰言，但是对他们的破坏和间谍活动已被破获的事实却不敢作声。他为了向美国讨好，竟不惜诬蔑朝鲜人民反对美国侵略的军事行动为“对朝鲜人民真正的独立与统一事业并无好处。”他奴颜婢膝地乞求美国批准给南斯拉夫以所谓对落后国家的经济援助。
    在二十五、二十六两日全体会议上发言的，还有多米尼加，国民党、南非联邦、古巴、玻利维亚、土耳其、菲律宾、萨尔瓦多、瑞典、哥伦比亚等国代表。他们大多重复攻击大国一致原则的滥调，古巴、土耳其及菲律宾公开支持美国的建议，瑞典则表示将予以“慎重考虑”。
