　　One Kilogram of White Coal Per Kilometer: Saving 2.2 Billion Monthly
    ——A Record of the Creation by Zhang Deqing, Chief Engineer of Shanghai Bus Company, Special Class Merit Citation
    Jin Yi

　　I put the word "creation" in the title, but when I talked to him about it, he immediately waved his hand gently and humbly, saying:

　　"No, no, it existed long ago—"

　　"I mean using it in cars, with such good results..."

　　This made him stop refusing, but then he thought again:

　　"It's not my own creation either, it's our collective creation."

　　"That's precisely the most valuable thing, because you know how to unite with the workers, connect with the masses, and you put aside the airs of a chief engineer."

　　He wasn't a talkative person. At this point, he stroked his graying temples and smiled silently.

　　We had already talked, and I had seen some materials. I felt that the first thing that should be mentioned is his:

  Work style of not being proud, not taking credit, trusting the wisdom of workers, and solving problems together.

　　He is an engineer, he is also a professor, and he learned his skills in an imperialist country. But in the new China of the people, he has been able to give full play to his strengths, demonstrate his abilities, and be recognized and respected by the people. When Zhao Dan and Huang Zongying recited his deeds on Shanghai People's Radio, he couldn't help but shed tears of emotion. He was happy, he was excited, and he deeply felt that whether it is mental laborers or physical laborers, whether it is engineers from the Soviet Union or engineers who studied in imperialist countries, as long as they serve the people wholeheartedly and increase the interests of the people, they will be praised and loved by the people.

　　Speaking of the white coal car he created, he would say that it was the result of good leadership, trade union assistance, and everyone's hard work.

　　"I was instructed to design the white coal car on September 16, 1949. After the design was completed, some difficulties and problems arose in practical use. So we printed pamphlets explaining its principles, gave lectures, and solved problems together. Engineers, technicians, and drivers all discussed together collectively, and as a result, all difficulties and problems were solved."

　　"What is the situation now?"

　　"Now all engineers can design, all technicians can repair, and all drivers can drive—guaranteed not to break down. New drivers, as long as they study for five days, will have no difficulties at all."

　　"This is the cooperation between mental and physical laborers."

　　"Workers are one family, with no distinction between each other."

　　The creation of the white coal car realized the

  Spirit of seeking truth from facts, a concrete manifestation of anti-blockade and anti-imperialism.

　　At a time when we were blockaded by the enemy and our gasoline production was very low, and we were in great need of transportation, Mr. Zhang Deqing's creation was extremely valuable.

　　I asked him to tell me the comparison between white coal and gasoline. He told me that it only had 70% of the horsepower at its peak, but the buses had high horsepower, so there was no impact after switching to white coal. As for the price, according to Shanghai's market price, it was only one-eighth of the price of gasoline.

　　"Will it damage the engine?"

　　"If it is filtered well, it will not damage the engine. Now we use three-stage filtration. We use trailers so that they can be removed at any time, and even with the trailers, gasoline can still be used."

　　"So, if we have gasoline in the future, will we not use white coal cars anymore?"

　　"That's not necessarily true, because the cost is low, and it's very cost-effective. The Soviet Union still uses white coal in its second five-year plan."

　　"Is white coal better than charcoal?"

　　"No, it's just cheaper. It is more prone to breakdowns than charcoal because white coal is not easy to undergo chemical reactions, has a high ash content, and is prone to slagging."

　　"But I rarely see public buses breaking down."

　　"I can't say absolutely not, but it's very rare, and this is due to the hard work and responsibility of the workers."

　　He never forgets his partners who work with him, and I have personally experienced how the workers of the Shanghai Bus Company have made leaps and bounds in their work since the liberation.

　　"I heard that you only came to the bus company to work after liberation."

　　"That's right, but I was in the bus company during the reactionary period, and then I left."

　　"Then why did you leave?"

　　"I couldn't stand it, I couldn't stand the bullying, so I went to work for Texaco. After liberation, I wanted to come back, and the worker comrades also wanted me to come back, so I came back."

　　These are a few short sentences, but among ordinary people, the material rewards are obviously very different. From this point, we can fully see how he

  Disregards personal interests and values the interests of the collective and the country.

　　Our new China, our people's own country, in the high tide of economic construction, needs many engineers like Mr. Zhang Deqing! Today, he is standing in the ranks of workers and peasants, coming to Beijing to attend the model worker conference.

  His thoughts and his wishes

　　"Everyone can't imagine how much the government values us, cares for us, and protects us. We didn't expect it at first, so we didn't prepare well. The praise we have received far exceeds what we deserve. If we don't do a good job when we go back, then we will really be letting ourselves down, and we will also be letting down our country."

　　"After the commendations, are there any people with bad emotions?"

　　"No, only more motivated people. This is also a test. Everyone must work hard to serve the people better."

　　"If all the scientists, engineers, and university professors in China were like Mr. Zhang, united together, then no problem would be a problem."

　　一公斤白煤一公里  每月节省二十二亿
    ——记上海公交公司特等功臣张德庆总工程师的创造
    靳以
    我把创造的字样放在标题里，可是当面和他谈起来的时候，他立刻就温和而谦虚地摇着手说：
    “不是，不是，早就有了的——”
    “我是说用在汽车上，有这么好的功效，……”
    这才使他不再推辞了，可是他又想起来：
    “也不是我自己的创造，是我们大家的创造。”
    “对了，这一点正是顶可贵的地方，因为您懂得和工人团结，与群众联系，您放下总工程师的架子。”
    他不是一个健谈的人，说到这里他就用手抚着灰白的鬓发，默默地微笑着。
    我们已经谈过了，我也看过一些资料，我觉得首先应该提起来的就是他那：
  不骄傲，不居功，信任工人的智慧，共同解决问题的作风。
    他是工程师，他也是教授，他是在帝国主义国度中学来本领。可是在人民的新中国，他才发挥了他的长处，他才施展出他的本领，他才被人民认识了，也受到人民的尊敬。当赵丹和黄宗英在上海人民电台朗诵他的事迹，他忍不住热泪盈眶了。他快乐，他感奋，他深深体味到：不管是脑力劳动者或是体力劳动者，不管是苏联的工程师或是在帝国主义国家留学的工程师，只要全心全意为人民服务，增加人民的利益，就会受到人民的褒扬，人民的爱戴。
    说到他所创造的白煤车，他就要说那是由于领导好，工会协助，大眶努力的结果。
    “我是一九四九年九月十六日受嘱设计白煤车的，设计好了之后，实用起来，就发生一些困难，也发生一些问题。于是我们就印小册子，说明它的原理，上大课，共同解决问题，工程师，技工，司机大家在一起集体讨论，结果是什么困难，什么问题都解决了。”
    “现在的情况怎么样？”
    “现在是工程师都会设计，技工都会修理，司机都会驾驶——保证不抛锚。新司机，只要学习五天，就什么困难都没有了。”
    “这才是体力劳动者和脑力劳动者的合作。”
    “工人本是一家人，不分彼此。”
    白煤车的创造，实现了
  实事求是的精神，是反封锁反帝的具体表现。
    在被敌人封锁的时候，我们的汽油产量又非常之少，我们又非常需要交通工具，张德庆先生的创造就极其有价值了。
    我请他告诉我白煤和汽油的比较，他告诉我只是在最高马力的时候打七折，可是公交的车子马力高，改用白煤以后没有影响。至于价格方面，照上海的市价来说，只合到汽油的八分之一。
    “会不会损坏机器？”
    “如果滤清得好，不损害机器的。现在我们用三道滤清。我们应用拖车，就为的是随时可以拆除，就是带着拖车，照样也可以用汽油。”
    “那么将来我们有了汽油，是不是就不用白煤车了？”
    “那也不一定，因为成本低，划算得很。苏联二次五年计划也还用白煤的。”
    “是不是白煤比木炭好些？”
    “不，只是便宜些，它比木炭更容易抛锚，因为白煤不容易起化学作用，灰分高，容易结渣。”
    “可是我很少看到公交的汽车抛锚的。”
    “我不能说绝对没有，可是非常少，这就是工人们的努力负责。”
    他随时不忘记和他共同工作的伙伴们，而我也亲自体验到，上海解放以后公交的工人们是如何在工作上有飞跃的进步。
    “我听说您是解放以后才到公交公司服务的。”
    “不错，可是在反动派的时候，我就在公交公司，后来我离开了。”
    “那您为什么离开呢？”
    “看不惯，受不了闲气，我到德士古公司做事。解放以后，我想回来，工人同志们也要我回来，我就回来了。”
    这是简短的几句话，可是在一般人中间，物质的报酬是显然有很大区别的。从这一点也可以充分地看出来他怎样。
  看轻了个人的利益、看重群体和国家的利益
    我们的新中国，我们人民的自己的国家，在经济建设的高潮中，需要多少像张德庆先生这样的工程师啊！他今天站在工人农民的行列中，到北京来开劳模大会来了。
  他的感想和他的愿望
    “大家都想像不到政府这样重视我们，照顾我们，保护我们。当初没有想到，所以我们没有好好做准备工作。我们所得到的颂扬远超过我们所应得到的。回去再不好好做，那可真对不起自己，也以不起我们的国家。”
    “在评功以后，是否有情绪不好的？”
    “没有，只有更积极的，这也是一个考验，大家都要努力，更好地为人民服务。”
    “如果全中国的科学家，工程师，大学教授都像张先生这样，团结在一起，那就什么问题都不成问题了。”
