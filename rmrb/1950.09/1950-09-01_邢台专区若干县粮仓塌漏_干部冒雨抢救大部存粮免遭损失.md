　　Grain Depots in Several Counties of Xingtai Prefecture Collapse and Leak;
    Cadres Brave Rain to Rescue Most Stored Grain from Loss
    [Our Newspaper] Serious collapse and leakage phenomena have occurred in the grain depots of several counties in Xingtai Prefecture, Hebei. Warehouse cadres in various counties have emphasized the safekeeping of public grain, and during the heavy rain period, they braved the rain to carry out rescue efforts, preventing or reducing damage to state property.
    Many warehouses in the counties of the prefecture suffered severe collapse and leakage during the heavy continuous rain in early August, mostly due to improper construction and the prevalence of old buildings. In order to prevent public grain from suffering losses, Nanhé, Nèiqiū, and Lóngyáo counties launched a campaign to protect warehouses. The warehouses in Nanhé County were mostly old tile-roofed houses that had been in disrepair for years, with severe rat damage around and on the roofs, causing numerous problems during rainy weather. Knowing the condition of the warehouses, the director of the warehouse, led four cadres day and night with lanterns to inspect and personally repair the damage from July 31st to August 4th, during the period of continuous heavy rain. All the cadres, even with their clothes soaked through and changed three times, did not leave their posts. Accountant Zhang Yongchang took the lead in inspections whenever the rain grew heavier. After four days and nights of effort, although there were twenty-eight leaks in the three warehouses, the efforts of all cadres ensured that more than 600,000 catties of public grain were saved from loss. In Nèiqiū, seventy-odd warehouses out of 114 leaked during the continuous heavy rain. In three of the warehouses, containing a total of 100,000 catties of public grain, the eaves collapsed due to the rain, causing rainwater to pour in. Wang Bingwen and Liu Yinglin, the manager and deputy manager of the neighboring Yumin Oil Factory (a production unit of the county government), discovered the situation and immediately led all the workers to carry out rescue efforts, covering the collapsed roofs with mats and oilcloth to prevent further rainwater from entering. County Magistrate Wang Weirang, upon learning of the situation, immediately led warehouse cadres to brave the rain and mobilize thirty-eight people to carry out grain shifting. Zhao Mingyuan, a cadre from the district grain depot who was inspecting warehouse work in the county, although suffering from a serious illness, continued to promptly inspect and personally work in the heavy rain. As a result of these rescue efforts, only more than 3,800 catties were wetted, with only about 100 catties damaged due to being retrieved from the mud. In Lóngyáo, a warehouse on West Street in the city stored 120,000 catties of wheat. During the torrential rain, the front eaves collapsed. However, under the leadership of warehouse director Cheng Xingbo and cadres Cao Huawen and Guo Baowen, only about 300 catties were lost, with most of the grain saved from loss.
    The rainy season is not yet over, and all localities should conduct timely and thorough inspections to avoid being caught unprepared. It is also important to regularly check for signs of insect infestation and mold.

　　邢台专区若干县粮仓塌漏
    干部冒雨抢救大部存粮免遭损失
    【本报讯】河北邢台专区若干县粮仓塌漏现象严重，各县仓库干部，重视公粮保管，大雨期中曾冒雨抢救，致使国家资财避免或减少损坏。
    该专区各县仓库许多库房，多因修建不当和旧房较多，致八月初大雨连绵期中，曾发生严重的塌漏现象。南和、内邱、隆尧等县仓库为免除公粮遭受损失，曾开展了护仓运动。南和县仓库多系年久失修的老瓦房，周围及房顶被鼠盗的很厉害，一遇雨天即毛病百出。该库主任因平时了解库房情况，故在七月三十一日到八月四日的大雨连绵期中，即带领干部四人不分昼夜提灯检查，并亲自动手进行修补，全部干部甚至衣服湿透连换三次均不脱离岗位。会计张永昌每逢雨越大时，即主动带头去检查。经过了四昼夜，三个仓房虽然有二十八处漏雨，但在全体干部的努力下，终于保住了六十多万斤公粮未受损失。内邱在大雨连绵中，一百十四间仓房，就漏了七十多间；其中有三座仓房是八间内共存有公粮十万斤，因房檐被雨冲塌，雨水灌入，邻居裕民油厂（该县机关生产）王炳文、刘英林正副二经理发现后，随即带领全体工人进行抢救，用席子和油布盖住塌屋，停止了雨水继续灌入。县长王维让闻悉，即带领仓库干部冒雨动员了三十八人进行倒仓。区粮库干部赵明元，在该县检查仓库工作，虽身患重病，亦在大雨中不停地及时进行检查和亲自动手。经这样抢救结果，漏湿了三千八百多斤，其中一百多斤因从泥中捞出受到损失。隆尧城内西街仓房一处存麦十二万斤，在倾盆大雨中，前屋檐被冲塌，但在仓库主任程兴波及干部曹化文、郭保文等三人的冒雨抢救下，最后检查结果除三百多斤损失外，大部亦得以免除损失。
    目前雨季尚未过去，各地尚应及时深入检查，以免临时慌乱。并应随时检查是否有生虫、霉坏现象发生。
