　　Former South Korean Pseudo-Assemblymen Joint Declaration
    Endorsing the Fatherland Front's Announcement to the People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd] TASS, Pyongyang, 3rd—Fifty former South Korean pseudo-“National Assembly” members, including Zhao Suang and An Zaihong, recently jointly issued a statement endorsing the Fatherland Front of Korea's August 14th statement, demanding that U.S. troops immediately withdraw from Korea. The statement said: We, the fifty former members of the South Korean pseudo-National Assembly, along with all the Korean people, actively endorse the August 14th announcement to the people by the Central Committee of the United Democratic Fatherland Front of Korea, and have signed the "Korean People's Statement." We demand the immediate withdrawal of the plundering troops of the American aggressors and the trial of the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique, who are subservient tools of the American interventionists, for selling out the Korean people. We once again appeal to the members of the South Korean National Assembly, urging them to abandon the shameful role of serving as obedient tools of the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique, and to rise up against them and stand on the side of the people and the fatherland.
