Comrades! Today we gather to celebrate the 29th anniversary of the founding of our Party. Twenty-nine years ago, our Party was just a Marxist group. Today, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, it has developed into a large party with more than five million members and has led the people to achieve historically significant great victories, becoming the founder and leader of the People's Republic of China. In order to victoriously complete the arduous construction tasks now facing the Party, the Party Central Committee has decided to launch a movement to rectify work style throughout the country. The Northeast Bureau has issued instructions based on the Central Committee's decision, which I believe everyone has seen. I would now like to offer some opinions on this important issue for your consideration.

As you know, the issue of rectifying the Party's work style is about how to further strengthen the Party's ties with the people.

Without a doubt, the Party Central Committee's line and policies are entirely correct. Looking at the entire history of the Party's struggle, our Party has always stood with the people and represents the interests of the broadest masses of the people. Our Party's prestige among the people of the whole country is also supreme. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, our Party, together with the people of the whole country, overthrew the people's most ferocious enemies, namely imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, which had long oppressed the Chinese people, and their concentrated representative – the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, achieving a tremendous victory in the Chinese people's revolution. In the Northeast, following the complete victory of the Liberation War and the full completion of land reform, we have also had a good start in economic construction. We have made progress in our work in the Northeast, and we have achieved results in various construction undertakings. This is also a fact that everyone can see.

But does this mean that our work in all aspects is already perfect and flawless? Are the people satisfied with all our measures in the Northeast and the work style of our Party members and cadres? That is to say, are the Party's ties with the people close enough and without any doubt?

Absolutely not. We Communists should not become complacent and arrogant because of our existing achievements and the people's praise, and fail to see our own shortcomings. We must realize that what we have done is only the beginning of the people's great cause, and our achievements in various major tasks are still far from our goals. There are still many shortcomings and errors that have not been corrected in time, thus causing losses in our work and hindering the close ties between the Party and the people.

This is the basis for our proposal to rectify the Party's work style.

	This Rectification is to Improve Economic Construction

Comrades! The basic task of our entire Party in the Northeast at present is to carry out economic construction. This rectification is to improve economic construction. In order to rectify our work style from various construction tasks, especially from economic construction, rather than detaching ourselves from current practical work or abstractly rectifying the Party's work style from books, we are prepared to seriously conduct a work inspection movement throughout the Party, actively expose various problems and errors in our work, especially in economic construction, examine the roots that hinder our work progress and affect the close ties between the Party and the masses, promptly correct shortcomings and errors, raise the policy level of the entire Party (especially the main responsible comrades at all levels) a step further, rectify the Party's work style, further enhance the enthusiasm of the entire Party and improve the Party's purity, so that all Party members can clearly and responsibly stand firmly at their work posts, closely link with all the people of the Northeast, and do a good job in the economic construction and other construction undertakings in the Northeast. This is the basic purpose of our rectification.

What are the main dangers hindering the advancement of our cause? What hinders the close ties between the Party and the people?

I think the most important things are the lack of policy viewpoints in practical work, the arrogance and complacency of some comrades who regard themselves as heroes, and the commandism, formalism, and the bad tendency of refusing criticism and self-criticism that come with them. The reason why these problems arise and are not corrected for a long time is inseparable from a certain degree of bureaucratism in the high-level leading organs. Now our Party is the party leading the state power, and our Party has a high prestige among the people. Our every word and deed has a great impact on the people. If we cannot quickly remove these bad work styles, then the degree of harm to the people and the country's construction undertakings is conceivable. Therefore, these bad work styles are particularly worthy of our vigilance.

	Examples of Detachment from the Masses and Violation of Party Policies

Comrades! What are the serious phenomena of our detachment from the masses and violation of Party policies? From my five-day discussion with the responsible comrades of various ministries and provinces and cities, as well as the materials reported by the comrades sent by the Northeast Bureau to inspect work at the grassroots, the following examples can be cited:

		Trade Work

For example, in terms of trade work:

When our trade departments complete the state's commercial plans, they lack specific implementation of how to strengthen planning, open up foreign sales channels and invigorate the exchange of materials in the inland market, correctly grasp price policies, support cooperatives and unite legitimate private businesses, and strictly implement economic accounting systems. As a result, the following problems have occurred:

(1) Some places forcibly assign sales and procurement tasks without considering the needs of the local people. As a result, there are phenomena such as untimely supply of goods, varieties and quality not meeting the needs of the people, and some competing sales and purchases.

(2) Some units lack planning in the allocation of materials, thus forming the phenomenon of cargo travel. For example, Heilongjiang Province has always produced a large amount of flour and sold it to various parts of the Northeast. The flour produced in the Northeast is already difficult to sell, but the Ministry of Trade has purchased 300,000 bags of flour from inside the customs and allocated a part of it to the province. The matches produced in Longjiang are already surplus, but matches are also allocated to the province from other places. As a result of blind allocation, horseshoe watches originally worth 800,000 yuan (Northeast currency, same below) were sold for only 100,000 yuan in rural Longjiang. In addition, the Ministry of Trade could not meet the needs of the industrial department for building materials such as corrugated iron, so it allocated it to rural Longjiang and limited it to be sold to farmers at a low price, but then the Ministry of Trade bought it back from the farmers at a high price. As a result, the state suffered meaningless losses.

(3) The regulations on price policies are not based on economic conditions, and do not take into account that there is still a large free market, but are simply stipulated according to administrative divisions. For example, in Heilongjiang Province, which has more than 30 counties, there are only two kinds of prices (that is, Qiqihar and Beian). The price of Suihua County, which is close to Harbin, does not follow Harbin, but follows Qiqihar. In addition, individual areas use administrative orders to stipulate that the local people and cooperatives are only allowed to buy things in the local state-owned stores, and are not allowed to buy things from neighboring provinces, counties, and districts. As a result, there is a phenomenon that violates the policy of free trade within the territory, which hinders the exchange of materials. In addition, the price of purchasing native products is mostly based on a simple task perspective, so that it fluctuates sharply with the rapid changes in the external market. On the one hand, it causes losses to the government (the price loss in the purchase of eggs, live pigs, small sesame seeds, pheasants, etc. in March and April this year alone reached 94.7 billion yuan); on the other hand, after the price drop, the government does not purchase, which leads to the backlog of products and affects the farmers' production mood.

(4) Our trade departments have set up too many retail stores in some cities regardless of needs and possibilities. For example, more than 100 meat stalls have appeared in Harbin. In addition, there are individual areas where the phenomenon of wrongly hindering legitimate private businesses from going to the countryside and cooperatives from entering the city has occurred.

(5) In the operation and management of trade work, there is a lack of specific measures for economic accounting. Some units only care about selling goods and do not care about profits and losses. For example, the Shenyang Department Store clearly lost 12.9 billion yuan in this year's cold goods sales work, but it still said that it was a great achievement in the summary! As for the backlog of goods and serious losses, there are even more. For example, the Shenyang Department Store had 6,000 jin of roasted glue baked near the heating pipes, 10,000 penicillin injections expired, and the faucet was not closed, and nearly 1,000 jin of white sugar was wet. Many such examples can be cited. In the structure of some trade departments, there is a serious manifestation of bureaucratization. For example, there are 232 people in the Shenyang Trust Company, of which only 7 were directly engaged in business operations, and now it has increased to 26, which is only 11% of the total number of people.

If all the above phenomena are not changed quickly, the losses to the country and the people are incalculable.

		Industry Aspects

In the industrial sector, the broad masses of workers have displayed their enthusiasm for labor, and with the assistance of Soviet experts, our industrial construction should have achieved greater results. However, there are still some shortcomings that need to be overcome urgently. Some examples can be cited:

For example, some factories and mines under the industrial department only pay attention to completing the production figures, and lack specific inspections. As a result, the quality of many products is very poor. Many of the lathes produced by the Machinery Bureau in the past did not meet the specifications (such as the three-one six-foot lathes produced by Machinery Factory No. 1 in the first quarter, all of which did not meet the specifications). The bicycles produced could not be sold due to poor quality. Due to poor quality or non-compliance with specifications, serious waste was formed in production; at the same time, the cost of products was increased, and it was not easy to sell them in the market, forming a backlog and hindering production. Secondly, this year's basic construction projects are very large, but some of the construction materials (such as red bricks, asbestos tiles, wood, etc.) and the quality of the projects are not good, wasting a huge amount of money from the state. The three-story building of 14,000 square meters of the Shenyang Institute of Technology was inspected and found that 80% of the positions of the pillars of the building were not correct; and the Jilin Paper Mill installed the "cooking tank" without prior investigation, and installed it after hitting a foundation of more than three meters. Later, when the foundation was laid, it was found that the lower part was all quicksand at a depth of seven meters, so the cooking tank project had to be reworked.

Another important problem existing in industrial work is the unity of technical personnel and staff. Originally, the number of technical personnel and staff in our enterprises was not enough. The poor quality of our products and the poor management are also related to our failure to do a good job in uniting technical personnel and staff. Some leaders of our enterprises have adopted a contemptuous attitude towards technical personnel and staff, and have not been able to unite them well to work. Some leaders have not fully enabled technical personnel and staff to have positions and powers, so that they can be transformed and improved in practical work positions; they have not formulated reasonable technical regulations and management rules as regulations for all employees to jointly abide by; they have not practically and specifically solved the difficulties in the lives and residences of technical personnel and staff; especially, they have not carried out sufficient education among workers to value technology and unite technical personnel and staff, so the enthusiasm and role of technical personnel and staff have not been fully utilized, and the labor creation of workers and the scientific guidance and reasonable management of technical personnel and staff have not been well combined, and there are also some phenomena of disunity among employees, which need to be solved urgently.

Finally, and most importantly, in the leadership of our industry, the operation and management of enterprises are still lagging behind the current situation of our industrial development. Many of our enterprises still lack specific and precise economic accounting, lack capital management, lack cost accounting, and lack scientific piece-rate wage systems. And these are the primary tasks for us to run enterprises well at present.

Of course, in order to do a good job in industry, in addition to the above points, the first is to formulate a more accurate and stable plan based on possibilities and needs, and stipulate the responsibilities of each department and each person for the implementation of the plan, and form it into a systematic system. In these areas, our shortcomings are still many, and we also need to improve them seriously.

		Agriculture Aspects

In the agricultural sector, I can also cite similar examples:

For example, the Hunhe irrigation water conservancy project in 1949 was the only project handled by the Northeast Water Conservancy Bureau itself in 1949. When construction started in the spring of last year, the Water Conservancy Bureau handed over such a large project to two technicians to be responsible for it, and never conducted in-depth inspections. As a result, the project was completed but could not be used. The Dafangshen sand drainage gate could not be pulled up during floods, resulting in more flooding. This year, it had to be reworked and repaired. This not only wasted the country's wealth, but also had a bad impact on the people. In addition, such as the Raohe River water control project, according to the report of the Water Conservancy Bureau, it has been basically completed, but after inspection, five of the six sluice gates have not been completed.

Another example is the promotion of new agricultural tools. According to the reflection of some troops and local areas, the quality of the new agricultural tools is not good, and many have been damaged, and the cost is very high. But the organs that manage this department have very poor serious inspection and timely correction.

Another example is the forestry issue. Due to indiscriminate felling and failure to pay attention to forest protection and afforestation, many good red pine trees have been cut down in many forest areas, and the poor poplar and birch trees have been left behind; some departments should not use red pine trees, but they also compete to use red pine, resulting in the waste of "big materials for small use." Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry investigated 3 million square meters of forests, of which diseased and rotten wood accounted for two-thirds.

Another issue is the issuance of agricultural loans. We always treat it as a routine matter, once a year, and have not well studied the new situation that has occurred in the rural areas of the Northeast after land reform and two years of large-scale production. Therefore, we lack specific analysis of old areas and new areas, disaster areas and non-disaster areas, households with production difficulties and households without difficulties, and generally issue agricultural loans, so the effect on agricultural production is not great. Individual farmers in some places even used the agricultural loans they received to buy liquor to drink.

		Public Grain Tax Collection

In the financial sector, I can cite examples of collecting public grain and taxes.

Regarding public grain, every place always reports how the cultivated land area has been expanded and how well it has been planted in the spring plowing summary; during the weeding, it is always reported how well the weeding has been done; and during the autumn harvest, it is reported how bad the harvest is, and even the cultivated land area is smaller than in the spring plowing; but when the state purchases grain, the number reported is more. This situation has almost become a common practice. Comrades should remember the lessons of last year. At the beginning of the autumn harvest last year, various places reported: floods in the south and droughts in the north, only 50% of the harvest; after the grain collection, some places said that it was not 50% but 60%; later, some provinces said that the actual harvest was 80%. This not only affects the state's difficulty in correctly grasping the collection policy, causing the phenomenon of being too light or too heavy (such as Tonghe in Songjiang last year only bearing 9%), reducing the state's income; but also affects the necessary preparation for the government's purchase work. This is an important reason for the stagnation of materials since April this year, which resulted in a sharp drop in the grain price in the free market, so that the farmers also suffered losses.

In terms of tax revenue, the comrades in charge of tax work in various places are active and responsible, and their work spirit is very good, but some places only care about exceeding the "task" and lack a policy viewpoint, thus forming the phenomenon of deviating from the policy and being too light or too heavy. Here we can cite the example of Andong City: In March and April of this year, the provincial tax bureau assigned a task of 15 billion yuan for business tax based on the capital turnover rate and transaction volume. According to the materials reported by the city's merchants, 8.7 billion yuan can be completed, and the agency production enterprises estimate that more than 2 billion yuan can be collected, and the business tax for January and February can be collected by checking accounts for more than 2 billion yuan. The total of the three can collect 13 billion yuan, which is only 2 billion yuan less than the prescribed task; if the strength is further organized to check the accounts, the task can be completed. However, the city tax bureau only sought to exceed the task, and universally doubled the number reported by the group, which violated the Party's policy and aroused dissatisfaction among some merchants.

		Trade Union Work

In addition, in the work of trade unions, due to a lack of clear understanding of the specific historical conditions of the current trade union work, there is no comprehensive understanding of the tasks of trade unions under the New Democratic regime, the unity of the entire working class, and the position and responsibility of trade unions in production. In a small number of public enterprises, some trade union workers do not go deep into the production process, but stand outside the production; they do not work hard to learn technology and study business, so that they gradually become experts, but stand by and give general leadership; they do not actively assist the administration in solving the difficulties in production and jointly do a good job in production, but passively complain and criticize more, and have less active and responsible spirit. Therefore, these comrades have not played a role or have not played the role they should have in the work of educating and organizing workers to learn technology, consciously abide by labor discipline, helping the administration to improve operation and management, closely uniting technical personnel and staff, and overcoming the phenomenon of worker mobility. All of these should arouse our serious attention.

Comrades! The main shortcomings and errors in our work are by no means just these. Therefore, the Party Committee, the government, the army, and the mass organizations of various departments must seriously and deeply inspect work in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and earnestly correct shortcomings and errors, so as to benefit the progress of the Party and the people's cause. What I said above mainly refers to some situations in the Northeast-level departments.

		Errors and Shortcomings in the Work of Various Places

We know that this kind of bureaucratism and commandism that deviates from the masses and violates policies exists more or less in various provinces and counties, and we must also conduct in-depth inspections and thoroughly correct them. Now I might as well cite some more examples here:

Some places force the masses to participate in mutual aid groups in order to so-called "complete the task." Some villages in Tangyuan and Mishan counties in Songjiang even fine or penalize farmers who withdraw from the group and practice individual farming; some districts and villages in Longjiang force mutual aid groups to keep accounts and sign covenants uniformly, so that the masses make false accounts and false covenants and paste them on the wall, nominally "look up and see happiness."

For example, in the forest area of ​​Suileng County, Heilongjiang, a mountain fire occurred. Someone reported to the county magistrate at the beginning, but the county magistrate said calmly: "Suileng catches fire every year, and it doesn't burn anything." As a result, the mountain fire spread from the wilderness to the forest, and from Suileng to Tieli. At this time, the county magistrate issued a notice and sent people to put out the fire. As a result, because the fire was too large, and the fire fighting was unorganized and unled, it was not put out. The mountain fire burned for half a month, destroying forests for more than a hundred miles. Wangqing County also had a similar situation. Look! To what irresponsible extent has this bureaucratism developed to the country and the people!

Another form of bureaucratism manifested in work is formalism.

For example, after the instructions or resolutions from above are announced, many places do not seriously study and discuss them in light of local conditions and stipulate specific implementation methods, but follow the example and transmit them level by level in the usual way. For example, Huachuan County mobilized for spring plowing and held 13 meetings of various sizes in the county, totaling 47 days. After the meeting, no specific arrangements were made. Cadres below said: "The task is a thick book, and the method is up to you." The masses said: "There is a thick book in the county, a piece of paper in the district, a mouth in the village, and only two legs left in the village."

For example, Wuchang Central Village mobilized the masses for spring plowing. In one month, the eight villages in the village held 156 mass meetings and seven days of village cadre meetings. The masses reflected: "Meetings every two or three days, it's really a crime to hold them. If you hold them until May 5th, the plow will not touch the soil."

Comrades! These bad work styles mentioned above will certainly be opposed by the masses. However, some comrades who have made such mistakes even insist on not changing. When they hear criticisms from the superiors or the masses, they do not show a welcoming attitude, but take a rejecting attitude. These people only want to listen to others' praises, and do not want to listen to others' criticisms. When there is any criticism from the leadership, he will also say: "Please give a basic assessment of my work from the superiors." These comrades do not understand that the achievements in work cannot be obliterated even if they are not mentioned, but if the errors are not criticized and corrected, it will cause greater losses to the revolutionary cause.

Finally, I would also like to mention the extravagant waste and even corruption and degeneration of a small number of comrades. This behavior not only damages the Party's ties with the people, but also, if not corrected, is very dangerous to the political future of these comrades themselves. Recently, the Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau and the Party committees of various places have dealt with some such cases. In the future, we must regularly mobilize all comrades and the broad masses to report such illegal behaviors to the Party's Discipline Inspection Committee and the government's People's Supervision Committee, so as to sweep these dirty things out of our team.

	There are Several Common Problems in Work

The purpose of telling you so many examples is to make everyone vigilant, not to be overwhelmed by victory and adopt an attitude of everything is going well to treat everything; but to continue to work diligently, seriously inspect work, dare to admit mistakes, and be good at correcting them. Some of the above examples are only individual phenomena, but from these examples, we can see common problems. I think there are the following:

		(1) Insufficient Party Policy Research and Policy Education.

As you know, the reason why our Party can win the sincere support of the broad masses of the people, and the reason why our Party can establish the closest ties with the people is because our Party has correct policies that represent the most basic interests of the vast majority of the people. This is the various policies formulated by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee that we follow. Policy is the direction of our actions, and the quality of policy implementation is the fundamental standard for measuring the quality of our completion of various tasks. Leaving the Party's policy to talk about tasks, or using coercive methods to complete numerical tasks, will result in detachment from the people.

However, due to the lack of policy education and policy research within the Party, in practical work, many of our comrades often only pay attention to completing the numerical tasks, and do not pay attention to grasping the policies. Therefore, they oppose the so-called "tasks" and policies. Many of our comrades do not complete the tasks given to them by the Party and the state within the limits of strictly following the national and Party policies, but adopt crude methods to carry out their work, do not pay attention to the specific situation, do not consider whether it is possible in fact, and are not willing to humbly consult with the local people, but simply complete the task, opposing being responsible to the superiors and being responsible to the people. There are also many comrades who only care about their own local needs and local interests, lack a global perspective, and therefore oppose the local and the whole. In this way, various forms of violations of policies have occurred.

		(2) Insufficient Business Research and Precise Calculation.

Some comrades do not know the numbers in their hearts, and are unwilling to work hard to conduct investigations and research; they do not understand the business, and have no determination to learn; some comrades even want to retreat.

These comrades have forgotten what Chairman Mao told us: "Serious economic construction tasks are in front of us. Some of the things we are familiar with are about to be idle, and things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do. ... We must overcome difficulties, we must learn what we do not understand. We must learn economic work from all experts (no matter who they are). We will worship them as teachers, learn respectfully, and learn honestly. If we do not understand, we do not understand, do not pretend to understand. Do not put on a bureaucratic attitude. Get into it, a few months, a year or two, three or five years, we can always learn."

		(3) Satisfied with the existing achievements, satisfied with the numbers of completed tasks, afraid of self-criticism.

All comrades who have this disease should carefully review a passage that Chairman Mao said to the entire Party during the Seventh National Congress. Chairman Mao said: "Whether there is serious self-criticism is also one of the significant signs that distinguish us from other political parties...The Chinese Communists, who take the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people as their starting point, believe that their cause is completely in line with justice, and are willing to sacrifice everything of their own, and are always ready to take their own lives to dedicate to our cause. Do we still have any thoughts, views, opinions, or methods that are wrong and do not meet the needs of the people that we are reluctant to give up? Do we still welcome any political dust or political microorganisms to contaminate our clean faces and erode our healthy bodies? Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the benefit of the people, making each of us living people feel sad when we think of them. Do we still have any personal interests or errors or shortcomings that cannot be sacrificed?"

		(4) Bureaucratic Attitude.

The first type: not accurately, essentially, and individually solving important problems, but perfunctorily, formally, and generally dealing with problems.

The second type: burying oneself in the sea of ​​paper in the office all day long, not going to the actual work posts to seriously inspect work, discover problems, and effectively solve problems.

The third type: commandism, not acting according to the specific conditions of the local area and the degree of awareness of the masses, but subjectively acting blindly.

As Chairman Mao said: "Commandism is wrong because it exceeds the level of awareness of the masses, violates the principle of voluntaryness of the masses, and suffers from an acute illness." Our comrades should not think that what they understand is the same as what the broad masses understand. Whether the masses have understood and whether they are willing to take action can only be known by investigating among the masses and in actual work.

Undoubtedly, the occurrence of the above problems is inseparable from the influence of the old society. Our cause has developed very quickly and greatly, and a large number of new Party members and new cadres have been added. The Party has not yet had time to conduct systematic education for them; and the old cadres lack experience in today's new and huge-scale economic construction work, and some people are accustomed to the old ways. These are all reasons. But the most important thing, I think, is that the Party's leading organs have failed to systematically provide education on policies and work styles, and to inspect and summarize work in a timely manner, so that these problems have not been completely resolved in a timely manner. In terms of the responsibility of leadership and education, the Northeast Bureau has not done well first. Here I have to take the main responsibility.

This rectification movement is to seriously solve the above problems with leadership.

	Correctly Carry out the Rectification Movement

How to carry out this rectification movement?

First, this rectification is to rectify from inspecting work, rather than detaching from work to carry out rectification. That is to say, we must conduct a Party-wide work inspection movement, discover problems and solve problems from inspecting work, so as to rectify the Party's work style. Therefore, each department and each comrade should conduct a serious inspection of their own work. Oppose general and sweeping inspections, but discover and study specific policy and business issues one by one, and solve them one by one, instead of just talking about it and finishing the matter.

Second, the steps of the rectification are from top to bottom, first rectifying the leading organs and leading cadres, and then rectifying the middle-level organs and middle-level cadres. For lower-level cadres, the main thing is to help them summarize their work, so as to train and improve them; things they do not understand, we must help them learn, and things that the masses do not like, we must help them get rid of, and cultivate their work style of contacting the people. But pay attention to the combination of new and old cadres, and the combination of top and bottom, to prevent the tendency of disconnection.

Third, the method of rectification is to widely promote democracy, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. On the one hand, leaders must set an example and make sincere self-criticism, and guarantee that the people being led have complete freedom of criticism, and are absolutely not allowed to suppress and retaliate; on the other hand, they must strengthen leadership and prevent the slogan of criticism and self-criticism from being vulgarized.

Fourth, this rectification generally does not conduct investigations into composition and history (this is the regular work of the organizational department). If serious errors are found in the rectification, disciplinary action must be given; or if there are political problems, the relevant departments should be responsible for handling them according to normal procedures, so as to avoid deviations.

Fifth, the rectification of the Party at all levels is led by the Party committees at all levels, and the rectification of each enterprise department is led by the leaders of each department. The branch should actively promote democracy and widely absorb the opinions of Party members and non-Party members in the organ. In the process of rectification, we must improve the work of Party committees and organ branches at all levels, and establish a regular system for learning policies and inspecting work.

We have full confidence that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, after this large-scale rectification movement of the entire Party, various errors in our work and various problems in work style will definitely be overcome, and the extensive ties between the Party and the people will definitely be further strengthened, so it will also make the work of the Party and the construction cause of the people's country advance by leaps and bounds!

　　密切党与人民群众的联系
    ——高岗同志在东北局庆祝中国共产党诞生二十九周年的干部大会上的讲话
    同志们！我们今天集会来庆祝我党诞生的二十九周年。二十九年前，我党只是一个马克思主义者小组，今天我们在毛主席的英明领导下已发展成为拥有五百多万党员的大党，且已领导人民取得了有历史意义的伟大胜利，成为中华人民共和国的建立者和领导者了。为着胜利地完成党现在所面对的艰巨建设任务，党中央已决定在全国展开整顿工作作风的运动。东北局已根据中央的决定发出了指示，想大家都已看到。我现在想就这个重要问题提出一些意见，请同志们考虑。
    大家知道，整顿党的作风问题，就是如何进一步密切党与人民群众的联系问题。
    毫无疑义的，党中央的路线、政策是完全正确的。从整个党的斗争历史看来，我党始终是同人民群众站在一起，并代表着最广大的人民群众的利益的。我们党在全国人民中的威信也是至高无上的。我们党在毛主席的正确领导下，同全国人民一道打倒了人民最凶恶的敌人，即长久地压在中国人民头上的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义及其集中的代表——国民党的反动统治，取得了中国人民革命的巨大胜利。在东北，我们继解放战争的完全胜利和土地改革的全部完成后，又有了经济建设的良好开端。我们在东北的工作有进步，我们在各种建设事业中都获得了成绩，这也是人所共见的事实。
    但这是不是说，我们在各个方面的工作已经完满无缺了呢？人民对于我们在东北的各种措施和党员干部的工作作风都已称心满意了呢？就是说，党与人民群众的联系都已十分密切而毫无疑问了呢？
    决不能这样说。我们共产党人丝毫不应该因为已有的成就和人民群众的赞许，就自骄自傲起来，而看不到自己的缺点。须知我们所做的还只是人民伟大事业的开端，我们在各种主要工作中的成就距离我们奋斗的目标还很远，还有许多缺点和错误，没有得到及时的纠正，因而造成了工作中的损失，妨碍了党和人民群众的密切联系。
    这就是我们提出整顿党的作风的根据。
            这次整风为了搞好经济建设
    同志们！我们东北全党当前的基本任务是进行经济建设。这次整风就是为了搞好经济建设。为要从各种建设工作中来整顿我们的工作作风，特别是从经济建设中来整顿我们的工作作风，而不是脱离当前实际工作，或从书本出发抽象地去整顿党的作风，因此，我们准备认真地来一次全党的检查工作的运动，主动地揭发我们工作中特别是经济建设工作中的各种毛病和错误，检讨阻碍我们工作前进与影响党和群众密切联系的根源，及时改正缺点和错误，把全党（首先是各级主要负责同志）的政策水平提高一步，把党的工作作风加以整顿，更加发挥全党的积极性与提高党的纯洁性，使全党的同志明确而负责地站稳自己的工作岗位，与东北全体人民紧密联系，搞好东北的经济建设及其他建设事业。这就是我们这次整风的基本目的。
    阻碍我们事业前进的主要危险何在呢？什么东西妨碍了党和人民群众的密切联系呢？
    我想，最主要的是在实际工作中的缺乏政策观点，和一部分同志以功臣自居的骄傲自满，及随之而来的命令主义、形式主义，以及拒绝批评与自我批评的恶劣倾向；这些问题之所以产生，甚至很久得不到纠正，则是同高级领导机关中某种程度的官僚主义倾向分不开的。现在我们的党是领导国家政权的党，我们党在人民中威信很高，我们的一言一行，都在人民群众中发生很大的影响，假如我们不能迅速去掉这些恶劣的作风，那么，对于人民和国家的建设事业的危害程度是可想而知的。所以这些恶劣的作风特别值得我们警惕。
            脱离群众与违犯党的政策的举例
    同志们！我们有那些脱离群众与违犯党的政策的严重现象呢？从我与各部委各省市负责同志五天的座谈中，以及由东北局派到下面检查工作的同志汇报的材料中，可以举出以下的一些例子：
        贸易工作
    比如贸易工作方面：
    在我们的贸易部门完成国家的商业计划时，对于如何加强计划性、打通对外销路与活跃内地市场的物资交流、正确地掌握价格政策、扶助合作社与团结正当的私商、严格实行经济核算制缺乏具体的贯彻，因而发生了以下的问题：
    （１）有些地方不按当地人民需要，强派推销与收购任务。因而发生货物供给不及时，品种、质量不合人民需要以及某些争销争购的现象。
    （２）某些单位调拨物资缺乏计划性，因而形成货物旅行的现象。如黑龙江省历来生产大量面粉，行销东北各地，东北产的面粉，已经感到不好出售，但贸易部却从关内购来面粉三十万袋，并拨给该省一部；龙江产的火柴早已过剩，但又从别处拨给该省火柴。由于盲目调拨的结果，本来价值八十万元（东北币，下同）的马蹄表，拨到龙江乡下只卖十几万元；还有工业修建中大量需要的瓦垅铁，拨到龙江乡下并限期贱价卖给农民，但因贸易部不能满足工业部修建的需要，又从农民手中以高价收回。因而给国家造成了毫无意义的损失。
    （３）价格政策的规定，不是按照经济情况，不考虑到还有很大的自由市场，而是简单地按行政的区划来规定。如黑龙江全省三十多个县份，只有两种物价（即齐市与北安），靠近哈市的绥化县的物价，不是跟哈市走，而是跟齐市走的。加以个别地区以行政命令的办法规定当地的人民和合作社只许在该地的国家商店买东西，不准本省本县本区人民到其邻近的外省外县外区购买东西，其结果就发生违反境内贸易自由政策的现象，对物资交流，反而起了阻滞作用。此外，收购土产的价格，也多从单纯的任务观点出发，以致随着外部市场的急剧变动而忽高忽低，这样一方面造成政府的损失（仅今年三、四月份收购鸡蛋、活猪、小麻籽、野鸡等在价格方面的损失即达九四七亿元）；另方面在跌价之后，政府不收购，又形成产品的滞销，影响到农民的生产情绪。
    （４）我们的贸易部门，在某些城市不按需要与可能设立了过多的零售店。如在哈尔滨市，出了一百多个肉床子。此外，还有个别地区发生错误地阻碍正当私商下乡与合作社进城的现象。
    （５）在贸易工作的经营管理上，缺乏经济核算的具体措施，有些单位只顾卖货不顾赔赚。如沈阳百货公司今年的推销冷货工作，明明赔了一二九亿元，但在总结时还说是很有成绩的呢！至于商品积压与严重的耗损现象那就更多了。如沈阳百货公司就有六千斤烤胶放在暖气管附近烤坏，一万支盘尼西林因过时失效，水笼头不关，把近千斤的白糖湿化，这种例子可以举出很多。在有些贸易部门的机构上，表现了严重的机关化。如沈阳信托公司二三二人，其中直接经营业务者原为七人，现在增加到二十六人，也只达总人数的百分之十一。
    所有上述现象如果不迅速改变，国家与人民的损失是不可计算的。
                                                  （⑴⑶）
        工业方面
    在工业方面，广大职工发挥了劳动积极性，并有苏联专家的各种帮助，我们工业建设应得到更多的成绩。但是，目前却存在一些亟待克服的缺点，可以举出一些例子：
    例如工业部系统下的一些厂矿，只注意到完成生产的数字，缺乏具体检查，因而不少产品质量很差。机械局过去生产的车床许多不合规格（如机械一厂第一季生产的三一台六尺车床全部不合规格），生产的自行车因质量不好，卖不出去。由于质量不好，或不合规格，形成了生产中严重的浪费；同时，使产品成本加高，在市场不易出售，形成积压，妨碍生产。其次，今年基本建设工程很大，但有些修建的材料（如红砖、石绵瓦、木材等）与工程的质量不好，浪费了国家巨量的金钱。沈阳工学院一万四千平方米的三层大楼建筑，经检查发现：该大楼柱座，有百分之八十位置不正；还有吉林造纸厂按装“蒸煮罐”，事先未作调查，打了三米多地基即行按装，后来打房基时，打至七米深处，发现下部均是流砂，因而蒸煮罐工程不得不返工重做。
    工业工作中存在的另一个重要问题，是团结技术人员与职员问题。本来我们企业中的技术人员与职员的数量就是不够的。我们的产品质量不好，经营管理不善，也同我们没有做好团结技术人员与职员的工作有关。我们有些企业的领导方面，对于技术人员与职员采取了轻视态度，还不能很好地团结他们工作。有些领导人员还没有充分地使技术人员与职员有职有权，使他们到实际工作岗位上获得改造与提高；还没有制定合理的技术规程与管理规则，作为全体职工共同遵行的法规；还没有切实地具体地解决技术人员与职员生活居住的困难；特别是还没有在工人中进行充分的重视技术与团结技术人员与职员的教育，因之技术人员与职员工作的积极性与作用未能充分发挥，工人的劳动创造与技术人员、职员的科学指导、合理经营，未能很好的结合，而且职工之间还有若干不团结的现象，这是亟待解决的问题。
    最后，也是最重要的一个问题，是我们在工业的领导方面，对于企业的经营管理还落后于我们工业发展的现状，我们的许多企业还缺乏具体的精确的经济核算，缺乏资金管理，缺乏成本计算，缺乏科学的计件工资制度。而这些乃是我们办好企业在当前的首要工作。
    当然，为了搞好工业，除了上述各点之外，首先是要根据可能与需要，制定比较精确的稳当的计划，并规定各个部门各个人对实现计划的责任，把它形成系统的制度。在这些方面，我们的缺点还是很多，同样需要认真改进。
        农业方面
    在农业方面，我也可以举出类似的例子：
    如一九四九年的浑河灌溉水利工程，是东北水利总局在一九四九年自己办理的唯一的工程，去年春天开始动工时，水利总局就把这样一个大工程，交给两个技术人员去负责，从未深入检查，结果工程完竣，不能使用。其中大房身排砂节制闸，在涨水的时候闸门拉不起来，以致淹地更多，今年就不得不返工重修，这样不仅浪费了国家财富，而且给人民以不好的影响。此外如饶阳河治水工程，据水利总局报告，已基本完成，但经检查结果，六个水闸，还有五个没有完成。
    再如推广新式农具问题。据一些部队与地方的反映，新式农具质量不好，坏了不少，而且成本很高。但我们管理这一部门的机关，认真的检查和及时的纠正很差。
    再如林业问题。由于乱加采伐，不注意护林与造林工作，致使不少林区好的红松木都砍了，差的杨木桦木都留下；有些部门不该用红松木，也竞用红松，造成了“大材小用”的浪费。最近农林部调查了三百万平方米的森林，其中病腐木竟占三分之二。
    再关于发放农贷问题。我们总是把它当做例行公事，一年一次，而没有很好地研究东北农村经过土地改革和两年大生产之后所已经发生的新情况，因而对老区与新区，有灾区与无灾区，生产上有困难的户与无困难的户，缺乏具体分析，一般化地发放农贷，其结果对农业生产作用不大。个别地方的农民，甚至将领得的农贷去买烧酒喝了。
        公粮税收
    在财政方面，我可以举出征收公粮与税收的例子。
    关于公粮方面。我们各个地方，在春耕总结时总是报告耕地面积如何扩大，如何种的好；铲趟中总是报告如何铲趟的好；而秋征时，则报告年成如何不好，甚至耕地面积都比春耕时缩小了；但在国家收购粮食时，报告的数目则又多出来了。这种情况，几乎成为一种通例。同志们应该记取去年的教训，去年秋收开始时各地报告：南涝北旱，仅五成年景；征粮后有些地方说不是五成而是六成；以后有的省份说实际有八成年景。这样不仅影响国家难于正确掌握征收政策，造成了畸轻畸重的现象（如松江的通河去年仅负担百分之九），减少了国家收入；而且影响到政府收购工作的必要准备，这是我们今年四月以来物资滞流的一个重要原因，其结果使自由市场粮价跌落甚多，使农民同样受到了损失。
    在税收方面。各地税收工作同志积极负责，工作精神很好，但有些地方他们只顾超过“任务”，缺乏政策观点，因而形成离开政策与畸轻畸重的现象。这里我们可以列举安东市的例子：该市三、四月份营业税，省税局根据资本周转率及交易额布置任务为一五○亿元。按该市商人自报材料可完成八十七亿元，机关生产企业估计可征二十多亿元，查账补报一、二月份营业税估计可征二十多亿元，三者合计可征一三○亿元，较规定任务仅差二十亿元；如再组织力量检查账目，任务是可以完成的。但市税局只求超过任务，将小组自报数目普遍增加一倍，以致违犯了党的政策，引起了某些商人的不满。
        工会工作
    此外，在工会工作方面，由于对当前工会工作的具体历史条件缺乏明确的认识，因而对于在新民主主义政权下面工会的任务，对于团结全体工人阶级，对于工会在生产中的地位与责任，未能全面的了解。在少数公营企业中部分工会工作人员不是深入生产过程之中，而是站在生产之外；不是努力学习技术、钻研业务，使自己逐渐成为内行，而是袖手旁观，笼统领导；不是主动地协助行政解决生产中的困难，共同搞好生产，而是消极地埋怨与指责多，积极负责的精神少。因之这些同志对于教育组织工人学习技术，自觉遵守劳动纪律，帮助行政改善经营管理，亲密团结技术人员与职员，以及克服工人流动现象等工作，没有起作用或没有起应有的作用。这些都应引起我们的严重注意。
    同志们！我们工作中的主要缺点和错误，决不只是这一些。因此，无论党委、政府、军队以及群众团体各个部门都要根据党中央和东北局的指示认真地深入地检查工作，开展批评与自我批评，切实地改正缺点和错误，以利党和人民事业的前进。以上我说的，主要是东北一级各部门的一些情形。
        各地工作中的错误和缺点
    我们知道这种脱离群众违犯政策的官僚主义、命令主义，在各省、各县都是或多或少地存在着的，必须同样进行深入检查与彻底改正。我现在也不妨在这里再举一些例子：
    有些地方为了所谓“完成任务”，强迫群众参加互助组。松江的汤原密山等县的某些村子，甚至对于退出小组实行单干的农民要罚钱、罚工；龙江的某些区村，强迫互助组一律记账、订公约，使得群众造假账、造假公约，贴在墙上，名为“抬头见喜”。
    再如：黑龙江绥棱县森林区发生山火，一开始就有人报告县长，但县长不慌不忙地说：“绥棱年年着火，烧不着啥。”结果山火蔓延，从原野烧到森林，从绥棱快烧到铁骊。这时县长才下通知，派人救火，结果因火势太大，又加对救火无组织、无领导，没有救下，山火延烧达半月之久，烧毁森林长达百里以上，汪清县也有类似的情形。请看！这种官僚主义竟发展到对国家、对人民何等不负责任的地步！
    官僚主义在工作中表现的另一种形态是形式主义。
    如上边的指示或决议公布之后，不少地方不结合本地情况加以认真地研究与讨论，规定具体的执行办法，而是依样画葫芦，一级一级照例地开会传达，如桦川县动员备耕，在县上开了大小十三次会，共开四十七天，会后未作任何具体布置。下边干部说：“任务一大本，办法自己想。”群众说：“县里一大本，区上一块纸，村上一张嘴，屯上只剩两条腿。”
    又如五常中心村动员群众备耕，一个月全村八个屯开了一百五十六次群众大会，七天村干部会，群众反映说：“三天两头会，开的真遭罪，开到五月五，铧子不沾土。”
    同志们！上述这些恶劣作风，当然是会遭到群众的反对的。但犯有这种错误的同志有的甚至坚持不改，在听到上级或群众对他的批评时，不是表示欢迎的态度，而是采取拒绝的态度；这种人只愿意听别人的颂扬，不愿意听别人的批评。遇到领导上有什么批评时，他还会说：“请上级对我的工作做一个基本估计吧。”这些同志不了解，工作中的成绩就是不讲也是抹煞不了的，而错误若不批评改正则会造成革命事业的更大的损失。
    最后，我还要提到少数同志的铺张浪费以至贪污腐化的行为。这种行为，不仅损害了党与人民群众的联系，而且如不痛加改正，对于这些同志本身的政治前途来说，也是十分危险的。最近东北局组织部与各地党委已经处理了一些这类的案子。今后我们要经常动员全体同志、和广大群众向党的纪律检查委员会与政府的人民监察委员会揭发这种犯法的行为，以便将这些肮脏的东西，从我们队伍中打扫干净。
            工作中存在着几个普遍性的问题
    我向同志们讲了这许多例子，目的就是要大家警惕，不要因胜利冲昏了头脑，采取万事大吉的态度来对待一切；而要继续兢兢业业，认真检查工作，勇于承认错误，并善于加以改正。上述的例子中有的只是个别的现象，但从这些例子中可以看出带普遍性的问题来，这样的问题我觉得有以下几个：
        （一）党内政策研究与政策教育不够。
    大家知道：我们党之所以能够取得广大人民群众的真心拥护，我们党之所以能够同人民群众建立最密切的联系，就是因为我们党有着代表最大多数人民群众最基本利益的正确政策，这就是毛主席与党中央所制定、我们所遵行的各种政策。政策就是我们行动的方针，政策执行贯彻得好坏，就是衡量我们完成各种工作任务好坏的根本标准。离开了党的政策去讲任务，或用强迫命令的方法去完成数字上的任务，其结果就会脱离人民群众。
    但是由于党内对于政策教育与政策研究不够，因之在实际工作中，我们不少同志往往只注意完成任务的数字，不注意掌握政策，因而把所谓“任务”与政策对立起来。我们也有不少的同志不是在严格遵循国家的和党的政策的限度内去完成党和国家给予他们的任务，而是采取粗暴的方法进行工作，不去注意具体的情况，不顾及事实上是否可能，不肯虚心地和当地人民商量，只是简单地去完成任务，把对上级负责与对人民负责对立起来。还有不少的同志，只顾自己局部需要与局部的利益，缺乏全局观点，因而把局部与全体对立起来。这样，就产生了各种形式的违反政策的现象。
        （二）钻研业务与精密计算不够。
    有些同志心中无数，又不肯下苦工夫去作调查研究；业务不懂，又没有决心去学习；有的同志甚至想打“退堂鼓”。
    这些同志忘记了毛主席所告诉我们的：“严重的经济建设任务摆在我们面前。我们熟悉的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟悉的东西正在强迫我们去做。………我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。不要摆官僚架子。钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”
        （三）满足于现有的成绩，满足于完成任务的数字，害怕自我批评。
    凡是害了这种病的同志，应该很好地重温一下毛主席在七大时对全党所说的一段话，毛主席说：“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党相互区别的显著标志之一……以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道我们还有什么错误的不适合人民需要的思想，观点，意见，办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？难道我们还欢迎任何政治的灰尘，政治的微生物来点污我们的清洁的面貌与侵蚀我们的健全的肌体吗？无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益或错误、缺点，不能牺牲吗？”
        （四）官僚主义态度。
    第一种：不是准确地本质地一个个地解决重要问题，而是粗率地、形式地一般地应付问题。
    第二种：成天埋在办公室的纸海里，不到实际工作岗位上去认真检查工作，发现问题，有效地解决问题。
    第三种：命令主义，不是根据当地的具体条件，群众的觉悟程度去行事，而是主观地蛮干。
    正如毛主席所说：“命令主义是错误的，因为它超过群众的觉悟程度，违反了群众的自愿原则，害了急性病。”我们的同志不要以为自己了解了的东西，广大群众也和自己一样的都了解了。群众是否已经了解并且是否愿意行动起来，要到群众中、实际工作中去考察才会知道。
    毫无疑问，上述问题的发生是与旧社会的影响分不开的。我们的事业发展得很快很大，新党员新干部大量增加，党还没有来得及对他们进行系统的教育；而老干部对于今天这样新的巨大规模的经济建设工作又多缺乏经验，有些人又习惯于过去的一套，这些都是原因。但最主要的，我想还是党的领导机关未能有系统地给以政策与作风的教育，及时检查与总结工作，因而就使这些问题未能及时地得到完全的解决。从领导和教育的责任上说，首先是东北局没有做好。这里我要负主要的责任。
    这次的整风运动，就是要有领导地认真地解决上面的这些问题。
            正确地进行整风运动
    如何进行这一次整风运动呢？
    第一、这次整风，是从检查工作中整风，而不是脱离工作进行整风。就是说，要来一次全党的检查工作运动，从检查工作中发现问题，解决问题，以整顿党的作风。因之，每个部门，每个同志，都应该对自己的工作进行严肃的检查。反对一般地泛泛地检查，要一个个地发现与研究政策的与业务的具体问题，并一个个地解决，而不是清谈一番，谈完了事。
    第二、整风的步骤是由上而下，先把领导机关与领导干部整好，再整中级机关与中级干部。对于下层干部，主要是帮助他们总结工作，从而训练与提高他们；他们不懂的东西，要帮助他们学会，群众不喜欢的东西，要帮助他们去掉，培养他们联系人民群众的工作作风。但要注意新老干部结合，上下结合，防止脱节的偏向。
    第三、整风的方法是广泛发扬民主，展开批评与自我批评。一方面领导者要以身作则，作诚恳的自我批评，保证被领导者有完全的批评自由，绝对不许压制与报复；另方面，又要加强领导，防止把批评与自我批评的口号庸俗化。
    第四、这次整风，一般地不进行查成份、查历史（这是组织部门的经常工作）。整风中发现错误严重，须要给以纪律处分；或有政治问题的，应分别由有关部门按正常手续负责处理，以免发生偏向。
    第五、各级党的整风，由各级党委负责领导，各企业部门的整风由各该部门的领导者负责。支部应积极地发扬民主，广泛吸收机关中党员与非党员的意见。在整风过程中，要提高各级党委的与机关的支部的工作，建立起学习政策与检查工作的经常制度。
    我们有充分的信心相信：在党中央和东北局的正确领导下，经过这一次全党的大规模的整风运动后，我们工作中的各种错误和作风上的各种毛病，一定会被克服，党与人民群众的广泛联系一定会进一步地加强，因而也一定会使党的工作与人民国家的建设事业大踏步地前进！
