    Hengyang Bureau Employees Submit Many Opinions to Be Delivered to Chairman Mao by Delegates
    [This Newspaper's Report] Of the twenty delegates from the railway system (excluding the two directly selected by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions) attending the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, all but one delegate from the Railway Public Security Forces, who is still being elected, have been elected. They are:
    Northeast Region: Du Xianyang, Tian Guiying, Wang Jikui, Xu Liangchen, Li Jinghua, Liu Handong, Kang Xuefu, Yin Xianming;
    Tianjin Region: Li Yonglu, Jiang Zhenyuan;
    Shanghai Region: Ma Gensheng;
    Hengyang Region: Zhang Wanxing;
    Taiyuan Region: Tian Yunhua;
    Zhengzhou Region: Yan Jiecun;

    Directly selected by the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union: Peng Min, Wang Juqian;
    Elected by the trade union directly under the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union: Sun Lianwang.
    The national railways attach great importance to this labor model election. Before the election, there was deliberation and propaganda, combined with production, and repeated introduction of labor model deeds to promote work. The Northeast Regional Committee of the China Railway Trade Union issued a notice as early as August 18, instructing that the model selection work should be combined with production and mobilizing all employees to learn from the advanced production experience of labor models. On August 25, the Northeast Railway Political Department, the Northeast Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Railways, and the Northeast Regional Committee of the China Railway Trade Union jointly held a telephone conference, calling on all Northeast Railway employees to launch a comprehensive production competition to welcome the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers and the first National Day. At present, Northeast Railway employees have been swept into a wave of competition, challenging each other and putting forward the resounding slogan of "Complete the task, ensure quality, and reduce costs." Railway employees in the Jinzhou area expressed their determination to eliminate all accidents, large and small, and complete transportation tasks. The Zhengjiatun Engineering Section strives to complete the glorious task of road maintenance once according to the new road maintenance method before October 1.
    When the railway administrations within the customs elected labor models, they all convened labor model representative conferences to nominate candidates and then elect representatives. The representatives were warmly supported by the employees, and the employee newspapers of each bureau published the individual history and exemplary deeds of the labor model representatives in great detail. When the Zhengzhou Bureau elected labor models, it held a symposium of labor model representatives to solicit opinions from various labor models on improving work. After the Hengyang Bureau elected representatives, it held a meeting and put forward many opinions, which were handed over to the representatives to bring to Chairman Mao. The representatives said happily: "It is our greatest honor and happiness to be able to go to Beijing and see Chairman Mao."
