　　We Have Common Loves and Hates
    Notes on the World Federation of Youth Delegation in Qiqihar and Harbin
    By Our Correspondent Liang Tian
    Visiting the Chahayang Mechanical Farm
    At 2:00 PM on September 12th, the World Federation of Youth Delegation arrived in Laha from Qiqihar, and from Laha went to visit the Chahayang Mechanical Farm in Heilongjiang Province. On the road from Laha to Chahayang, every village and every street corner was crowded with welcoming people. The Mongolian people of Buxi gave the World Federation of Youth Delegation more than a dozen watermelons, saying, "We give the watermelons from our fields to our young comrades to quench their thirst. This is a small gift, but it comes with deep affection!"
    When the WFDY delegation arrived at the Chahayang Farm, they were warmly welcomed by all the farm workers.
    Zhao Da, the farm manager, introduced the history of the Chahayang Farm to them.
    When people see the rows of agricultural machinery neatly lined up in front of the warehouse today, when they see the waves of golden rice ears rippling in the vast fields, when they see the male and female tractor drivers busy repairing machinery, making clanging sounds, who would have thought that buried in the Chahayang Farm were no less than 50,000 corpses of Chinese laborers who were forcibly brought here by the Japanese imperialists to build water conservancy projects and were tortured and enslaved to death? When excavators and shovels were digging the water lines, they often turned up piles of white bones. Today, this farm, irrigated by the blood and tears of the Chinese people, has become fertile land, won by the Chinese people through struggle. In January 1948, the people began to rebuild the ruins destroyed by the war. For three years, the tractor drivers have worked diligently, greening this "Great Northern Wilderness," and dedicating their bountiful harvests to the motherland and the people. They are worthy of their compatriots who died under the bayonets of the Japanese invaders.
    The output of the Chahayang Mechanical Farm has been increasing every year. The average rice yield was 522 kilograms per hectare the year before last, 2,336 kilograms per hectare last year, and is estimated to be 3,000 kilograms per hectare this year. The highest experimental yield is 6,000 kilograms per hectare, and this year it may reach 10,000 kilograms. The cultivated area is also increasing year by year, from 2,000 hectares the year before last to 6,355 hectares this year. The number of tractors has also increased from 23 to 67 this year.
    Each representative of the WFDY took out their notebooks and recorded these numbers that had multiplied.
    In the production competition to welcome the autumn harvest, the Chahayang Farm has seen a constant stream of activists and production models. Youth League member Wang Shicheng drove a Stalinez-3 tractor, pulling four seeders, achieving a daily efficiency of 88.08 hectares; Wang Shilin drove a Stalinez-80 tractor, pulling eight disc harrows, achieving a daily efficiency of 127 hectares. These amazing achievements show that these young tractor drivers are not only familiar with the machines, but also with complex methods of combined cultivation. They have all received material rewards and red flags from the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government.
    Our tractor drivers are not only model producers, but also brave peace fighters. All 2,300 employees of the farm participated in the peace signature campaign, showing their firm will to love peace. Of the 15 articles published by the employees on the wall newspaper, 10 were protests against the atrocities of US imperialism in invading Taiwan and Korea. Zhang Xiuqin, in an article entitled "The Chinese People Must Remember That US Imperialism Owes Us Another Blood Debt," expressed her anger at the US air intrusion. Wang Zhong, secretary of the Youth League, pointed out in his report: Although the youth of the farm love peaceful construction and oppose war, if the war-mongers dare to launch a war of aggression and destroy the fruits of our labor, we will jump from the tractors to the tanks and drive away every aggressor.
    At the welcome meeting at the farm, Manavov, the youth representative of Bulgaria, introduced the current situation of the state-owned farms and cooperative farms in Bulgaria. He described in a grateful tone the care of the Soviet Union and the Bulgarian government for the farmers, who are living, working, and laboring happily. He repeatedly paid tribute to the Chinese tractor drivers and wished them greater achievements.
    Director Zhao Da described the farm's prospects to the World Federation of Youth Delegation. He said: A hydroelectric power station can be built between Datoushan and Yazishan on the upper reaches of Chahayang, with an estimated generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts. We will receive strong assistance from the government, and construction will begin soon. After the power station is completed, our farm will be completely electrified, and under the shining of the free sunshine, our peaceful construction labor will blossom brilliantly.
    At 6:30 PM, the WFDY delegation crossed the Nenjiang River and returned to Laha Station. The powerful, rhythmic rowing of the boatmen and the singing of the WFDY representatives echoed in the night sky of the Nenjiang River. This chorus tells us how harmoniously the hearts of peace-loving people all over the world are united.

    Harbin People Warmly Welcome Guests
    At 8:00 AM on September 13th, the World Federation of Youth Delegation arrived in Harbin from Qiqihar. The people of Harbin, who had strongly supported the front lines during the Liberation War, welcomed the WFDY delegation with a grand welcoming procession. The welcoming crowd escorted the youth representatives out of the station and held a welcome rally of more than 20,000 people in front of the Soviet Martyrs' Monument. Chen Mo, deputy secretary of the Harbin Municipal Youth League, delivered a welcome speech and asked the representatives to convey the Chinese youth's firm will to defend peace to the youth of various countries. The Soviet youth representative, Semi Chastny, told the welcoming youth that every victory won by the Chinese youth strengthens the power of the peace and democracy camp. His speech was often drowned out by shouts of "Long Live Mao Zedong!" and "Ura! Stalin!" Canadian youth representative Wamsley, as a representative of the Canadian Council for World Peace and the Canadian peace activist Wen Youzhang, paid tribute to the Chinese youth. He said: Chinese students have a glorious tradition of struggle. Chinese youth like to sing "Unity is Strength," and unity has become the source of victory for Chinese youth in their struggles. Canadian youth will remember this song and use the spirit of this song to fight.
    Amidst the cheers of the crowd, the WFDY delegation split into two groups to visit the Harbin Railway Factory and the Harbin Institute of Technology. (At the Harbin Railway Factory, Factory Director Zhang Hongshu and many labor heroes, model Party members and Youth League members, and Soviet employees warmly received the WFDY delegation members. The workers of Harbin Railway welcomed our young comrades with the determination of all 4,500 people to participate in the peace signature campaign. On that day, the workers over-fulfilled their task and repaired one more locomotive, freight car, and passenger car each.
    The World Federation of Youth Delegation entered the site for a visit. In front of the furnace and next to the lathe, the WFDY representatives warmly shook hands with the Chinese workers, their hands and bodies covered in oil, thanking and encouraging the Chinese workers for their heroic labor in creating material strength for the peace and democracy camp.
    The WFDY delegation also visited Jingwei Elementary School. The Young Pioneers, wearing red scarves, surrounded each WFDY representative, offering them flowers, models of airplanes and ships, precious commemorative albums, and also presenting each WFDY representative with a red scarf, the glorious symbol of Chinese children, personally tying it on them. The WFDY representatives were so excited that they shed tears, and everyone hugged a child tightly. The Iranian youth representative hugged two children in his arms, asking and answering questions, keeping the translation comrades busy. Bugarra, the head of the WFDY delegation, told the children the story of how one chopstick is easy to break, but seven chopsticks cannot be broken, hoping that Chinese children and children all over the world will unite closely.
    The representatives of the World Federation of Youth Delegation who visited the Harbin Institute of Technology were carried into the school by thousands of friendly hands of Chinese youth students. The Institute of Technology, with the best equipment and teaching experience, has an even more precious history of glorious struggle. The president, Feng Zhongyun, chairman of Songjiang Province, was the leader of the underground work of the Institute of Technology when Japanese imperialism occupied Northeast China. During the 14 years of the Anti-Japanese War, 20 outstanding Communist Party members among the students of the Institute of Technology sacrificed their lives under the guns of the Japanese invaders, and more were tortured in prison. The school history report by Gao Xi, the dean of academic affairs, moved every WFDY representative.
    At 3:30 PM, a welcome rally of 50,000 people was held in Zhaolin Park in Harbin. Soviet and Italian youth representatives addressed the Harbin youth to express their respect. When the Harbin youth presented gifts to the delegation, the audience burst into thunderous applause. Fu Changchun, a Harbin special model worker and Youth League member, presented the representatives with a glass pen engraved with a peace dove, hoping that they would use the pen of peace to write out the common loves and hates of the youth and call on the youth of the world to create a beautiful and happy future. Young peasant students also presented the WFDY delegation with precious local products and autograph books. At the meeting, the Italian youth representative presented the Chinese youth with a flag symbolizing the struggle of the Italian youth, and the Soviet youth representative presented the Chinese youth with records and a phonograph.

　　我们有共同的爱和恨
    记世界青联代表团在齐齐哈尔和哈尔滨

    参观查哈阳机械农场
    九月十二日下午二时，世界青联代表团由齐齐哈尔市抵拉哈，并由拉哈赴黑龙江省营查哈阳机械农场参观。从拉哈到查哈阳的道路上，每一个村庄，每一个街口，都挤满了欢迎的人群。布西的蒙族人民给世界青联代表团送了十几个西瓜，他们说：“我们把自己田里的西瓜送给青年战友们解渴，这是礼轻人情重啦！”
    世青代表团到达查哈阳农场的时候，受到了全体农场职工的热情欢迎。
    农场场长赵达向他们介绍了查哈阳农场的历史。
    当人们看见今天库房前面排着整齐的农业机械的行列时，看见广阔的田野上翻动着金黄色的稻穗的波浪时，看见男男女女的拖拉机手们忙着修理机械，响起铿锵的声音时，谁会想到，在查哈阳农场里曾散埋着不下五万个被日帝强力逼来修建水利工程，折磨奴役致死的我国劳动人民的尸体呢？挖泥机和铁锹在挖掘水线时，还时常翻起一堆堆的白骨。今天，这一片由中国人民血泪灌溉成为肥田的农场，是中国人民用战斗赢到自己手中的。一九四八年一月，人民开始重建被战争摧毁的废墟。三年来，拖拉机手们辛勤地劳动着，绿化了这片北大荒，以丰硕的收获献给祖国和人民，他们无愧于死在日寇刺刀下的同胞。
    查哈阳机械农场的产量每年均在增加，前年每公顷水稻平均收获五百二十二公斤，去年平均收获二千三百三十六公斤，今年估计平均可收获三千公斤。试验的最高产量为每公顷六千公斤，今年可达一万公斤。耕地面积也逐年在增加，前年耕地为二千公顷，今年已增至六千三百五十五公顷。拖拉机也自二十三台增加到今年的六十七台。
    世青代表团每位代表都掏出了笔记本，记录下这些成倍的数字。
    查哈阳农场在迎接秋收的生产竞赛中，一再涌现出大批的积极分子和生产模范。青年团员王世成驾驶斯达兹三号拖拉机，拉四台播种机，日效八十八公顷零八亩；王世林驾驶斯达兹八十号拖拉机，拉八台圆盘耙地机，日效一百二十七公顷。这些惊人的成绩，说明了这些青年拖拉机手们不但熟悉机器，而且也熟悉复杂的联结耕种方法。他们都得到黑龙江省人民政府的物质奖励和红旗。
    我们的拖拉机手们不仅是模范生产者，同时，他们也是勇敢的和平战士。全农场二千三百个职工都参加了和平签名，表明了他们爱好和平的坚决意志。职工们在墙报上发表的十五篇稿件中，有十篇都是对美帝侵略台湾朝鲜暴行的抗议。张秀琴以《中国人民要记住美帝又欠我们一笔血债》为题，说出对美机侵犯的愤怒。青年团书记王忠在报告中指出：全场青年虽然热爱和平建设、反对战争，但是，如果一旦战贩敢于发动侵略战争，要来毁坏我们的劳动果实时，我们将从拖拉机上跳到坦克车上，赶跑每一个侵略者。
    在农场的欢迎会上，保加利亚青年代表曼那伏夫，向我们的拖拉机手介绍保加利亚国营农场和合作社农场的现况，他用感激的语调叙述了苏联和保加利亚政府对农民们的关怀，农民们正在幸福地生活着、工作着、劳动着。他一再向中国的拖拉机手们致敬，并预祝获得更大的成就。
    赵达厂长向世界青联代表团描绘农场远景。他说：查哈阳上流大头山与鸭子山之间，可以兴建水力发电站，估计可发电十万千瓦。我们将获得政府的大力协助，不久将来即可动工。发电站修成后，我们的农场便将完全电气化，在自由阳光的照耀下，我们和平建设的劳动，必将开出灿烂的花朵。
    下午六时半，世青代表团渡嫩江返拉哈车站，船工们有力的、有节奏的橹声，与世青代表们的歌唱交响着，在嫩江的夜空中飘荡回旋。这合唱告诉了我们，全世界爱好和平的人民的心是多么和谐地结合在一起。
    哈尔滨人民热情欢迎嘉宾
    九月十三日八时，世界青联代表团自齐齐哈尔抵达哈尔滨市。曾在解放战争中大力支援前线的哈市人民，以盛大的欢迎行列迎接世青代表团的到来。欢迎的人群拥着青年代表们走出车站，在苏军烈士纪念碑前举行了二万多人的欢迎大会。哈尔滨市青年团副书记陈模致欢迎词，并请代表们向世界各国青年转达中国青年坚决保卫和平的意志。苏联青年代表赛米恰斯尼向欢迎的青年说，中国青年所获得的每一次胜利，都增强了和平民主阵营的力量。他的演说，时常淹没在“万岁！毛泽东！”“乌拉！斯大林！”的欢呼声中。加拿大青年代表华姆斯雷以加拿大拥护世界和平委员会，与加拿大和平人士文幼章的代表身份，向中国青年致敬。他说：中国学生有着光荣的斗争传统。中国青年喜爱歌唱《团结就是力量》，团结已成为中国青年在斗争中得到胜利的源泉。加拿大青年将记住这个歌，并要用这个歌的精神去斗争。
    在夹道欢呼中世青团分两批去参观哈尔滨铁路工厂和工业大学。（在哈尔滨铁路工厂，张鸿树厂长和许多劳动英雄、模范党员团员、苏籍职工，热情地招待着世青代表团员。哈铁的工人们用全体四千五百人参加和平签名的决心，迎接了我们的青年战友们。工人们就在这天，超任务地多修好机、货、客车各一台。
    世界青联代表团进入现场参观。在熔炉前、在旋床旁，世青代表们热烈地和满手满身油渍的中国工人握手，感谢和鼓舞中国工人们为和平民主阵营创造物质力量的英勇的劳动。
    世青团还去参观了经纬小学。系着红领巾的少年儿童队员，包围着每一个世青代表，向他们献花、献飞机和轮船的模型、献珍贵的纪念册，还向每位世青代表献赠一条中国少年儿童们光荣的标志——红领巾，亲自为他们系上。世青代表们兴奋得流出了眼泪，每个人都紧紧地抱起了一个小朋友。伊朗青年代表双臂中抱着两个儿童，一问一答，忙坏了翻译同志。世青代表团团长布加拉为儿童们讲了一根筷子容易折，七根筷子折不断的故事，希望中国儿童和全世界的儿童紧紧地团结起来。
    参观哈市工业大学的世青代表团的代表们，被中国青年学生们千百只友谊的手抬进校内。有着最好设备和教学经验的工业大学，更有着最可宝贵的光荣斗争历史。校长为松江省主席冯中云，就是在日本帝国主义侵占东北时，工大地下工作的领导者。在十四年的抗日斗争中，工大同学中优秀的中共党员，有二十名牺牲在日寇的枪弹下，在监牢里受折磨的更多。教务长高锡的校史报告，感动了每一位世青代表。
    下午三时三十分，哈市兆麟公园举行了五万人的欢迎大会。苏联和意大利青年代表向哈市青年致词表示敬意。当哈市青年向代表团献礼时，全场掌声雷动。哈尔滨特等模范、青年团员傅长春将刻着和平鸽子的玻璃笔献给代表们，希望他们用和平的笔写出青年们共同的爱和恨，号召全世界青年来创造美满幸福的未来。青年农民学生也向世青代表团献上珍贵的土产和签名册。会上，意大利青年代表以象征意大利青年斗争的旗帜，苏联青年代表以唱片、留声机赠给中国青年。
