　　A Tenacious Sea Battle
    ——In Memory of People’s Navy Gunner Zhao Xiao'an
    We will always be tenacious against the enemy; tenacity is a noble quality of revolutionary fighters.
    Bai Sheng
    At dawn on July 10, 1950, on the sea near the ×× Mountains in the East China Sea, wind and waves lashed the two small gunboats of a certain artillery fleet of the People's Navy – "Gunboat No. 3" and "Gunboat No. 103" – which were anchored at the foot of the ×× Mountains to monitor enemy ships. Apart from the crashing and howling of the waves, everything seemed so tranquil. But an unsettling event finally occurred.
    When the squad leader (and captain) of the two small gunboats discovered enemy ships operating in the distant sea through binoculars, he immediately awakened all the comrades who were still sound asleep. Everyone immediately took their battle stations. The two small gunboats quickly weighed anchor and sailed to the front of the mountains. Afterwards, it was decided that Gunboat No. 103 would return to request instructions, and Gunboat No. 3 would monitor the enemy ship. At this time, the enemy ship was also gradually moving forward. It turned out to be an enemy gunboat more than ten times larger than Gunboat No. 3.
    The East China Artillery Detachment gathered near the ×× Mountains must not be discovered by the enemy. The enemy ship was getting closer and closer, what to do? Shao Jianming, the squad leader of Gunboat No. 3, decided to meet the enemy ship and not allow them to advance any further. He immediately issued the order to strike the enemy.
    Gunboat No. 3 sailed heroically towards the enemy ship like an arrow, and the two ships were only five or six hundred meters apart. Zhao Xiao'an, a young and brave gunner and member of the Youth League, saw it very clearly on the gun platform and repeatedly requested the squad leader to open fire, but the squad leader did not agree.
    The two ships sailed closer and closer, and the distance was only more than two hundred meters. The enemy ship fired first. The enemy ship's 13 cm and 25 cm machine guns fired at Gunboat No. 3. At this time, the squad leader issued the order to open fire. Zhao Xiao'an was extremely excited, grabbed the twin machine gun and fired a burst. He shot so accurately that the enemy ship was obviously startled. The helmsman veered the gunboat to the left, and Zhao Xiao'an aimed directly at the enemy ship's gun platform and fired five more accurate bursts of machine gun fire. The enemy ship suddenly emitted thick smoke and flames. The ammunition handler shouted excitedly. Zhao Xiao'an concentrated his fire on the enemy ship and launched a fierce attack until he suppressed the enemy ship's artillery fire.
    However, the enemy ship, under constant attack, struggled to activate its 40 cm main gun. Unfortunately, the small gunboat, which was more than ten times smaller, was hit by five shells. The left gun of Zhao Xiao'an's twin machine gun had been destroyed. He knew that the life and death of the entire boat depended on this one gun. He shot even more calmly and bravely; squad leader Shao Jianming also assisted him by continuously firing rockets at the enemy ship.
    The fierce artillery battle between the two ships lasted for more than ten minutes, and the enemy ship was obviously suffering serious damage, with smoke and fire constantly burning. However, our small gunboat's hull was also badly damaged. At this moment, a piece of shrapnel hit the squad leader's left eye, and he fell down. But he immediately stood up again, but then fell down again. The squad leader heroically sacrificed himself. Zhao Xiao'an's right arm and right leg were already injured, but when he saw the squad leader lying next to the rocket launcher, his heart burned like fire. He forgot his pain and angrily vented the shells at the enemy.
    The battle continued. Zhao Xiao'an suddenly felt that the small gunboat had a problem, and the hull was just spinning around. He was afraid that the comrades in the wheelhouse were also injured, so he immediately asked the ammunition handler Ding Zhiyin to check. Sure enough, they were also seriously injured. All this only strengthened Zhao Xiao'an's will to avenge his comrades. Unfortunately, when the right gun was also destroyed by enemy fire, Zhao Xiao'an's right leg was injured again. However, he endured all the pain, climbed out of the gun platform, and prepared to take the helm. When he glanced at the squad leader lying next to him, a feeling of comradely love in battle strongly pierced his heart.
    When he climbed into the wheelhouse, using his injured arm, he poured out all his strength to straighten the rudder. He said excitedly and affectionately to the navigator: "Boatman, you show me the direction, I want to drive the small gunboat back!" At this time, Zhao Xiao'an became the only commander on the boat. The small gunboat had not been driving back for long when the comrade in charge of plugging the leaks suddenly reported that the stern was already sinking. Zhao Xiao'an urgently ordered the comrades in the cabin to climb up, the engine should not stop, and just drive back like this. However, the sea water continued to rush in, the engine stopped running, and the hull began to sink gradually. Zhao Xiao'an told everyone to put on their life jackets and prepare to go into the water. He said excitedly: "Comrades, remember! We are the Chinese People's Navy, we must row back, we must avenge the sacrificed comrades!"
    At this time, everyone went into the water, but Zhao Xiao'an still stood at the cabin door. He was reluctant to leave this fighting gunboat, and even more reluctant to leave the sacrificed squad leader, but the small gunboat was sinking. He, who was seriously injured in half of his body, had no strength to bring the small gunboat and the sacrificed comrades back together. His heart ached severely, even more than the wound, until the small gunboat completely sank, and then he floated up from the water. Looking at the vast ocean, the mountains on the coast of the motherland forty miles away, Zhao Xiao'an bravely rowed towards the coast of the motherland. He wanted to come back, he vowed to avenge his comrades.
    The sea roared and the waves rolled, as if testing the strong, brave and fighting will of this People's Navy warrior. The injured Zhao Xiao'an, relying on his strong left arm, faced the headwind waves and rowed forward tenaciously. On one wave, he saw a comrade, and he shouted: "Let's row back together, we must avenge the enemy!" He rowed hard towards that comrade, but they were scattered by a wave as soon as they met. Zhao Xiao'an saw his comrades also rowing forward, and he was extremely happy.
    At this time, the sun had already risen from the sea. Our tenacious naval warriors bravely rowed forward. The surging waves hit him one after another, and the wounds were painfully soaked in the sea water, but they endured it. They firmly believed that they would definitely be able to row back alive. When the sun was in the middle, Zhao Xiao'an was so thirsty that he had to drink the bitter and salty sea water. He rowed forward hard, rowing, watching the sun gradually move towards the west. He didn't know how far he had rowed, and he didn't know how far away the coast was. There was only a vast expanse of waves in front of him. He was thirsty, hungry, and his wounds were even more painful from being soaked in sea water. The only left arm he could move had softened, and he was exhausted. He thought: "Sink down?" "No, no," the squad leader who fell in a pool of blood appeared before his eyes. "I want to live, I want to avenge, I want to avenge the squad leader, the motherland, and the sacrificed comrades." He also thought of Paul Kochakin, the protagonist of "How Steel Was Tempered", how did he live in the battle! A strong courage impacted him, allowing him to break through the evil waves and desperately row forward. Suddenly he saw a small reef not far ahead, he rowed forward and struggled to climb onto the small reef. Then he fell there in a daze. When he was awakened by the severe pain, the blood was still flowing non-stop, and the small reef was stained red with blood. He struggled to tear all the clothes on his body to bandage the wound, gritted his teeth, he thought he couldn't let the blood flow anymore, he still had to row back!
    At dusk, our tenacious and heroic People's Navy gunner had clearly seen the lovely coast of the motherland and the undulating mountains. He was so happy! He rowed forward bravely. This heroic and tenacious People's Navy gunner Zhao Xiao'an finally rowed to the coast. He was rescued by the army comrades and the people guarding the mountain. The first thing he told the army comrades was: "Quickly send motor sailboats to patrol, the comrades on the boat have all returned."
    Gunboat No. 3 completed a certain mission, preventing the enemy ship from approaching ×× Mountain.
    Following this battle at sea near ×× Mountain, in the × Mountain naval battle, their gunboat team cooperated with the army to inflict heavy blows on the enemy ships. One enemy ship was sunk and one was damaged, and one was captured. Although this made Zhao Xiao'an exceptionally excited, he couldn't wait to heal his wounds quickly and return to the sea to avenge the sacrificed comrades.
    Today, when the battle heroes of the People's Liberation Army's navy, army, and air force gather in the people's capital to receive the great love of the people's motherland and the unanimous respect and highest honor of the people of the whole country, our heroic and tenacious People's Navy warrior Zhao Xiao'an has also gloriously come to the people's capital.
    Young Zhao Xiao'an has a tall and strong body. He is only twenty years old this year and was born in an ordinary peasant family. At the age of sixteen, he was forced to join the Kuomintang navy as a sailor. In those painful days, he tasted the beatings and scoldings of the Kuomintang naval officers. On April 23, 1949, he followed all the officers and soldiers of the former Kuomintang Second Fleet in a heroic uprising and surrendered to the embrace of the people's motherland.
    In the embrace of the people's motherland, in the People's Navy troops, under the cultivation of the Party, he humbly studied and more clearly understood everything in the past, and improved his political understanding. He was gloriously approved to join the Youth League. This heroic and tenacious performance at sea was the first test he received after joining the League.
    When he was unanimously supported by the East China People's Navy soldiers to attend the National Combat Heroes Conference, he humbly felt that he had not been able to make any contributions to the people. In the capital, when reporters met him, he resolutely stated that in the future, he would continuously study, master new naval technology, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, strive to build the People's Navy, resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the enemy at sea, and liberate Taiwan.

　　一个顽强的海上战斗
    ——记人民海军枪炮手赵孝庵
    我们对敌人永远是顽强的，顽强是革命战士的高尚品质。
    柏生
    一九五○年七月十日的拂晓，在东海××山附近的海洋上，风浪吹袭着停泊在××山脚下监视敌舰的人民海军某炮舰队的两艘小炮艇——“炮艇三号”和“炮艇一○三号”。除了海浪的撞击声，呼啸声，一切都显得是那么宁静。但不平静的事件终于发生了。
    当两艘小炮艇的分队长（兼艇长）在望远镜中发现在远远的海面上有敌舰活动的时候，立即把所有还在酣睡中的同志们唤醒。大家立刻进到了战斗的岗位。两艘小炮艇迅速地起锚开进到山的正面。之后，决定由炮艇一○三号回去请示，炮艇三号监视敌舰。这时敌舰也逐渐向前移动。原来那是一艘比炮艇三号要大十余倍的敌人的炮舰。
    在××山附近集结着的华东某炮艇大队，这是无论如何不能让敌人知道的。敌舰越来越近，怎么办呢？炮艇三号分队长邵剑鸣决心迎击敌舰，不许敌人再向前进一步。他立刻下达了打击敌人的命令。
    炮艇三号像飞箭似地英勇地向敌舰驶去，眼看两舰只隔五六百公尺了。年青勇敢的枪炮手青年团员赵孝庵在炮台上看得很清楚，连续向分队长请求开炮，分队长没有同意。
    两舰愈驶愈近，距离只不过二百多公尺了。敌舰先开炮了。敌舰的十三厘米和二十五厘米机关炮，一齐向炮艇三号射击过来。这时分队长传下了开炮的命令。赵孝庵兴奋极了，抓着双联机关炮就是一梭子，他打得那么准，显然敌舰是受惊了。舵手将炮艇向左偏了一下，赵孝庵正好对准敌舰炮台射击，又一连准确地发了五梭子机关炮，敌舰顿时冒起浓烟和火舌。弹药手兴奋地喊起来。赵孝庵更集中火力向敌舰展开猛烈的攻击，直到把敌舰发射的炮火压制下来。
    但敌舰在被不停的打击中，却挣扎着开动了四十厘米的主力炮。不幸，这相差十余倍的小炮艇，被打中了五炮。赵孝庵的双联机关炮的左炮已被打坏，他知道全艇的生死存亡都维系在他这一门炮上了。他射击得更沉着更勇猛；分队长邵剑鸣也协助他用火箭筒向敌舰连续射击。
    两舰激烈的炮战进行了十余分钟，敌舰显然是遭受了严重的打击，烟火不停的在燃烧着。但我们的小炮艇的船身也受了重伤。这时突然一块弹片打进了分队长的左眼，他倒下去了。但马上他又站了起来，可是随即又倒了下去，分队长英勇的牺牲了。赵孝庵的右臂和右腿已经负了伤，但他看到分队长倒在火箭筒旁边时，他的心像火一样的燃烧起来，他忘记了自己的疼痛，愤怒地把炮弹向敌人泄去。
    战斗在继续进行中。赵孝庵忽然感觉这小炮艇像出了毛病，船身光在打转。他恐怕是操舵室的同志也受了伤，立即叫弹药手丁志银去查看，果然他们也负了重伤。这一切只有更增强了赵孝庵为同志们报仇雪恨的意志。不幸，当右炮也被敌炮炸毁时，赵孝庵右腿再一次受了伤。然而他忍耐着一切疼痛，爬出了炮台，预备去把舵。当他一眼望见倒在他旁边的分队长，一种阶级同志战斗的友爱感情，强烈地刺痛着他的心。
    当他爬进了操舵室，用负了伤的臂腕，倾出全身的力量，把舵板正了方向。他激动亲切地向领水的同志说：“船老大，你替我指示方向，我要把小炮艇开回去！”这时赵孝庵成了艇上唯一的指挥者了。小炮艇向回开进不久，负责塞漏的同志忽然报告，船尾已经下沉了。赵孝庵紧急命令板舱里的同志爬上来，机器不要停，就这样驶回去。然而海水继续冲击进来，机器停止转动了，艇身也在开始渐渐下沉。赵孝庵叫大家都穿好了救生衣，准备下水。他激动地说：“同志们，记住！我们是中国人民的海军，我们要划回去，要为牺牲的同志报仇！”
    这时大家都下了水，但赵孝庵仍然呆立在舱门口，他舍不得这个战斗的小炮艇，更舍不得牺牲的分队长，但小炮艇是往下沉去了。半个身子负了重伤的他，是没有力量再把小炮艇和牺牲的同志一同带回去了。他的心剧痛着，比伤口还厉害，直到小炮艇完全沉了下去，他方从水里浮上来。望着苍茫的海洋，四十里外祖国海岸上的山峦，赵孝庵勇敢的向着祖国的海岸划着，他要回来，他发誓要替同志们报仇雪恨。
    海涛呼啸着，海浪翻滚着，像是在考验着这个人民海军战士的坚强勇敢的战斗意志。负伤的赵孝庵，凭着他粗壮有力的左臂，顶着逆风的海浪，顽强地向前划进着。在一个浪头上他看到一个同志，他喊道：“咱们一块划回去，咱们要向敌人报仇！”他用力向那个同志划去，可是他们刚会合，又被一个浪头打散。赵孝庵看见自己的同志也在划进，他的心里愉快极了。
    这时太阳已经从海面上升起了。我们顽强的海军战士勇敢地向前划进着，奔腾着的海浪一个接连一个地迎面向他打来，伤口被海水浸得一阵阵的发痛，但他们忍耐着，他们坚决的相信，他们一定能够活着划回去的。当太阳照在正中的时候，赵孝庵口渴得实在厉害，只好喝下了苦咸的海水。他用力的向前划着，划着，眼看着太阳已经逐渐移向西方。他不知道他划了多远，也不知道离海岸还有多远。眼前只有茫茫的一片海浪。他口渴，饥饿，他的伤口被海水浸得更加疼痛，他惟一能够划动的左臂已经软下来，他已浑身无力。他想：“沉下去吗？”“不，不，”他眼前幌动着倒在血泊里的分队长。“我要活着，我要报仇，我要替分队长、替祖国、替牺牲了的同志们报仇。”他又想起了“钢铁是怎样炼成的”主角保尔·柯察金，他是怎样在战斗中生活下去的呵！一股强烈的勇气冲激着他，使他突破恶浪，向前拼命地划去。忽然他瞧见了不远的前面有一个小礁石，他向前划去，努力爬上了这个小礁石。便昏昏沉沉地，倒在那里了。当他被剧烈的伤痛震醒后，血还止不住地在流着，小礁石已被鲜血染红了一片。他挣扎着把全身的衣服都撕破下来包扎起伤口，咬紧了牙关，他想不能再让血流下去了，还是要划回去的啊！
    黄昏时候，我们的顽强英勇的人民海军枪炮手，已经清楚地看到了可爱的祖国的海岸，和起伏的山峦了。他是多么高兴呵！他勇猛地向前划进着。这个英勇顽强的人民海军枪炮手赵孝庵终于划到了海岸。他被山上守卫的陆军同志和老百姓救了上来。他第一句话告诉陆军同志的是：“赶快派机帆船出去巡逻，艇上的同志都回来了。”
    炮艇三号是完成了一定的任务，阻止了敌舰对××山的接近。
    在××山海上这一次战斗后，接着，在×山海战中，他们的炮艇队与陆军配合，给敌舰以重大的打击。击沉和击伤敌舰各一艘，而且还俘掳了一艘。这虽然使赵孝庵异常兴奋，但他恨不能把自己的伤赶快养好，再亲自回到海上为牺牲的同志们报仇。
    今天，当人民解放军的海、陆、空三军战斗英雄齐集在人民首都，接受人民祖国伟大热爱和全国人民一致的崇敬与最高的荣誉的时候，我们这位英勇顽强的人民海军战士赵孝庵也光荣地来到了人民首都。
    年青的赵孝庵，有着一副魁伟粗壮的身躯，他今年才只有二十岁，出生在一个普通的农家。他在十六岁时被迫参加了国民党的海军当水兵。他在那痛苦的日子里，尝尽了国民党海军官员们的打骂。一九四九年四月二十三日，他随着原国民党第二舰队的全体官兵，英勇地举行了起义，投向了人民祖国的怀抱。
    在人民祖国的怀抱里，在人民海军部队里，他在党的培养下虚心学习，更清楚地认识了过去的一切，提高了自己的政治认识。他光荣地被批准加入了青年团。这次海上英勇顽强的表现，就是他入团以后第一次所受的考验。
    当他这次以全票得到华东人民海军战士的拥护，来出席全国战斗英雄大会的时候，他谦虚地感到自己还没有能够为人民立下什么功劳。在首都，当记者会见他的时候，他坚毅地表示：今后要不断地学习，掌握新的海军技术，在共产党的领导下，为建设人民的海军而努力奋斗，坚决彻底地把敌人消灭在海上，解放台湾。（附图片）
