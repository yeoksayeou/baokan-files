Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: The newspaper *Izvestia* published on the 13th an article by Malkin entitled "A History of Plunder, Deception, and Crime," discussing the contrast between water conservancy projects in the Soviet Union and capitalist countries.

The author points out: The power industry, one of the sectors where the contradictions of capitalism are reflected most obviously and diversely, is a prime example. Water conservancy engineers in bourgeois countries cannot utilize the complex water resources of Western Europe. For example, the Alps are shared by six capitalist countries, and the Rhine River is shared by five. Under capitalist conditions, it is completely impossible to utilize these rivers in a planned manner. The Niagara Falls in the United States is an even more typical example of the poor utilization of water power. The right bank of Niagara Falls houses American hydroelectric stations, while the left bank houses Canadian hydroelectric stations. As American engineers themselves admit, these hydroelectric stations are like a series of watermills on a small river, completely unsuitable for utilizing such a powerful source of energy. The Aswan Dam on the Nile River can only be used for irrigation, while the possibility of building a powerful hydroelectric station to produce billions of kilowatt-hours of electricity has not been utilized. The reason for this is that the plan drawn up by the British colonialists did not focus on industrial development but only wished to maintain economic backwardness. For more than forty years, the United States and Canada have been unable to reach an agreement on building a large hydroelectric station on the banks of the St. Lawrence River. The American grain monopolists are working to sabotage the construction plan of this hydroelectric station because they fear that this new waterway will be fully utilized by the Canadian wheat magnates, thereby threatening the profits of the American monopolists.

Malkin further states: The history of water conservancy construction in capitalist countries is a history of plunder, deception, and crime. The construction of the dams in the Nile Delta lasted nearly seventy years, sacrificing countless workers. During the construction of the Suez Canal, thousands of workers died from labor and starvation. During the construction of the St. Gotthard Tunnel in the Alps, so many workers died that bourgeois statisticians dared not publish the figures. The Panama Canal is one of the most expensive, chaotic, and deceptively designed canals. For nearly forty years, various companies have one after another defrauded the American people of money allocated for construction, turning the Panama Canal into a death bank, allowing the working people to die in batches under malaria, labor, and inhuman living conditions.

In the Soviet Union, the situation is completely the opposite. Water conservancy projects are a component part of Lenin-Stalin's national electrification plan. Facing a bright future, the working people are carrying out unprecedented great construction projects with unparalleled enthusiasm.

The two huge dams spanning the Volga River at Kuibyshev and Stalingrad are both larger in area than the largest dams in the world. Neither the Wilson Dam in Alabama, USA, nor the Krokton Dam, nor the Aswan Dam in Egypt, nor the Lloyd Dam in India can compare with them. The two dams, together with the Turkmen Main Canal, will supply enough water to irrigate 22 million hectares of land, which is eight times greater than the entire Nile River irrigation basin. This area of land exceeds two and a half times the irrigated area of the United States, fourteen times the entire sown area of Denmark, twenty-five times the cultivated land of the Netherlands, and forty-five times the cultivated land of Belgium.

In conclusion, Malkin emphasizes: In the Soviet Union, water conservancy projects fully serve the development of social productive forces, while in capitalist countries, water conservancy projects controlled by instigators of new wars are primarily tasked with supplying electricity to the munitions industry. The American military is widely using hydraulic technology in war preparations. These bandits are plotting shocking crimes; in order to establish a vast strategic frontier, they would not hesitate to blow up the Lorelei Rock on the Rhine River, turning the fertile fields of the Rhine River valley and dozens of German towns into marshland.

    两个世界水利工程的对比
    苏联：劳动人民为未来的幸福进行伟大的建设
    资本主义各国：掠夺、欺骗、给人民制造灾难
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十三日的消息报发表了马尔金所撰题为《掠夺、欺骗和犯罪的历史》的专文，论述了苏联与资本主义国家的水利工程的对比。
    作者指出：动力是资本主义的矛盾反映得最明显最多样性部门之一。资产阶级国家的水利工程师，不能利用西欧复杂的水源，例如，阿尔卑斯山是为六个资本主义国家所共有。莱茵河是为五个资本主义国家所共有的。在资本主义的条件之下，想有计划地利用这些河流是完全不可能的。美国的尼亚加拉瀑布更是拙劣地利用水的动力的典型。尼亚加拉瀑布的右岸是美国的水电站，左岸是加拿大的水电站。正如美国工程师们所承认的，这些水电站就像小河上一连串的水磨，完全不适于利用这种强大动力来源。尼罗河上的亚苏安水闸只能用于灌溉，而建造强大水电站以生产数十亿千瓦时电量的可能性并没有被利用。其原因便是英国殖民者所拟订的计划不是注意工业发展，而只愿保持经济的落后状态。四十多年以来，美国和加拿大对于在圣劳伦斯河畔建筑一座庞大的水电站一事不能成立协议。美国的粮食垄断资本家努力破坏这一水电站的建造计划，因为他们惧怕这条新水路将被加拿大小麦大王们充分利用，以至威胁了美国垄断资本家的利润。
    马尔金进一步称：资本主义各国的水利建设的历史，是一部掠夺、欺骗，和犯罪的历史。在尼罗河三角洲上建造的水闸，差不多继续了七十年，牺牲了无数的工人。在建造苏彝士运河的期间，成千的工人们因劳役和饥饿而死亡。在建筑阿尔卑斯的圣哥大运河期间，死亡的工人多得使资产阶级统计家们不敢发表数字。巴拿马运河更是耗费最大，工作最紊乱，设计上最骗人的运河之一。将近四十年的期间，各种公司一个接着一个地骗取了美国人民拨充建筑工程之用的金钱，却把巴拿马运河变成死亡的河岸，让劳动人民在疟疾、劳役和非人的生活条件下整批地死去。
    在苏联，情况却完全相反。水利工程是列宁——斯大林的全国电气化计划的一个构成部分，劳动人民面向光芒万丈的未来，正以无比高涨的热情，进行着史无前例的伟大建设工程。
    跨越伏尔加河上的古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站的两座巨大的水闸，面积均比世界上最大的水闸为大，不论是美国亚拉巴马州的威尔逊水闸或是克洛吞水闸，埃及的亚苏安水闸或是印度的洛伊德水闸，都不能和它们相比。两座水闸加上土库曼大运河，将要供给足以灌溉二千二百万公顷土地的水量，大于全部尼罗河灌溉流域八倍。这一片土地超过了美国灌溉面积的两倍半，比丹麦的全部播种地带大十四倍，比荷兰的耕地大二十五倍，比比利时的耕地大到四十五倍。
    马尔金在结语中强调指出：在苏联的国土上，水利工程充分为社会生产力的发展而服务，而在资本主义国家，被新战争煽动者所控制的水利工程，却首先执行着把电力供应军需工业的任务。美国的军部正在把水力技术广泛使用在战争准备上。这些匪徒们正策划着惊人的罪行，他们为了建立广阔的战略性疆界，竟不惜炸毁莱茵河畔的女神崖，使肥沃的莱茵河流域的田地和几十座德国市镇沦为泽国。
