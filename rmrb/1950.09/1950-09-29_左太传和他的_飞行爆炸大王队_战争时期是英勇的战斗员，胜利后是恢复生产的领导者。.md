　　Zuo Taichuan and His "Flying Explosion King Team"
    War-Time Heroic Fighters, Post-Victory Leaders in Production Recovery

    Zuo Taichuan, the Shandong militia hero and "Flying Explosion King," used his landmine tactics to strike hard at the enemy during both the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. From 1944 to 1947, Zuo Taichuan and his "Flying Explosion King Team" laid landmines 180 times, totaling 750 mines, killing or wounding 235 Japanese, puppet, and Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers, destroying 4 cars, 2 carts, 1 cannon, and seizing more than 40 rifles. More importantly, Zuo Taichuan, with his own stubbornness and courage, taught the people how to strike at the enemy to protect their lives and property.

    Six or seven years ago, the name of this young man, along with the explosions of landmines, was spread among the people of Yiyuan County, Shandong. At that time, Zuo Taichuan was the leader of the joint defense team. He was the first to learn how to lay mines. He laid mines in the village, blasting away the enemy who were looting grain. He laid them in the woods, killing the Japanese who were cutting down trees. Militiamen competed to learn how to lay mines, and villagers from all around came to ask Zuo Taichuan for advice. Thus, the people of Yiyuan County launched a landmine war against the enemy, forcing them to huddle in their strongholds, afraid to come out. In 1945, at the district-wide militia conference, he was publicly elected by the masses as the explosion team leader. From then on, he officially left production and led the militia to fight the enemy.

    Zuo Taichuan's landmines were not just for defense, but also for offense. In October 1946, Zuo Taichuan's explosion team was ordered to march to the Bo (shan)-Lai (wu) border area to strike at the invading Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The people reported that the puppet township office in Ba Tu had murdered revolutionary family members. Zuo Taichuan said, "Wipe them out!" In the dark of night, Zuo Taichuan led two militiamen into the puppet township office, captured the sentry, and left behind landmines. The next day, the puppet police went to open the door and were blown up at the entrance. The puppet township chief sat down on his chair, and both he and the chair were blown to smithereens. The drawers and earthen bed were also bombed. From then on, Zuo Taichuan's flying mines blasted from Boshan to Laiwu, from Yiyuan to Xintai, causing the enemy to live in constant fear and unease. The bandit soldiers secretly said, "Don't be heartless, or you'll run into Zuo Yama."

    Zuo Taichuan's minefields once blocked the fully American-equipped regular army of the Kuomintang bandit gang, and continued to block them for twenty-four days.

    In May 1947, the bandit 11th Division, which had occupied Xintai, attempted to clear the Xin (tai)-Lai (wu) highway and continue north. Zuo Taichuan led the militia explosion team to intercept the enemy. After a day and a night, Zuo Taichuan led the militia from Zhuanshanzi to Huaishu Ridge, laying minefields for more than ten miles. The attacking enemy rushed up Zhuanshanzi and triggered forty-eight linked mines. Zhuanshanzi erupted like a volcano, and forty-three bandit soldiers were killed. When the enemy reached the highway, they triggered flag mines, head mines, and cluster mines... Cars and horse-drawn carriages climbed Huaishu Ridge, and both people and vehicles tumbled down the mountain. The enemy launched several attacks, but were all driven back by landmines. Zuo Taichuan's explosion team's minefields were like an impregnable wall, blocking the enemy's path.

    The Chiang bandits' 25th Army attacked Yiyuan from Laiwu. Zuo Taichuan's militia team rushed to the Yilai Highway, staying up for two days and two nights to lay more than 300 landmines, creating a minefield 55 miles long. The enemy's artillery vehicle was blown into the river, and corpses lay on the road. A bandit troop went to occupy Bingpan Mountain, but never came down. When the enemy behind them went up to check, all eleven men were dead. The landmines terrified the enemy, who moved slowly and crawled down as soon as they heard an explosion. After eight days of attack, they had only advanced forty miles. Zuo Taichuan also led the militia to harass the enemy with cold shots.

    With the explosions of landmines, Zuo Taichuan's name became well-known among the broad masses of the people. The Luzhong Military Region awarded Zuo Taichuan the title of "Flying Explosion King" and named his explosion team the "Zuo Taichuan Flying Explosion King Team". From then on, wherever the red flag of the "Zuo Taichuan Flying Explosion King Team" flew, the people welcomed them with gongs and drums. They brought confidence to the people and disaster to the enemy.

    Zuo Taichuan joined the Communist Party-led Children's Vanguard at the age of fifteen. Afterwards, he was always a leader in the Youth Salvation Association and militia. He joined the Chinese Communist Party at eighteen. The indomitable spirit cultivated by the Party from his youth, and the flames of hatred for the enemy brought from his own class, surged in the blood of this young hero. In the most difficult and critical times, he persisted in the struggle like an iron man. In August and September 1947, most of central and southern Shandong fell into enemy hands. The landlords and despots who had been suppressed during the land reform raised their heads again, established "Returning Home Corps," killed revolutionary family members, and retaliated against the people. At this time, just as Chairman Mao pointed out, "the sky seems dark," the main force launched an attack on the outer lines, and many leading organs also withdrew to the north. Zuo Taichuan, then the district armed forces minister, was ordered to lead the district militia explosion team back to Yiyuan behind enemy lines to persist in the struggle. He swore to the party secretary, "I would rather die than show weakness to the enemy!" A few days later, he divided the explosion team into many small groups, appeared in the enemy's heartland in Huangzhuang District, and moved through sorghum fields and mountain grass, attacking enemy vehicles, capturing enemy sentries, and distributing leaflets. Zuo Taichuan sneaked into enemy-held villages, killed traitors who sold out the people's interests, and dragged out the extremely evil Dong Yongchang and Li Baoshan from the puppet township office and executed them. He warned the landlords, "The Communist Party will never leave, the sky will not be dark every day, those with bad consciences, be careful of your heads!" In this difficult period, he led the militia team like a stern judge, judging the rebellious elements, protecting the people, and inspiring the morale of the masses.

    This people's hero, like a sharp knife, churned in the enemy's heart. The terrified enemy offered rewards everywhere for the capture of Zuo Taichuan, sending out regiments of troops to encircle and search, and repeatedly spread rumors that "Zuo Yama has been killed" in order to weaken the people's hope. But the next day, Zuo Taichuan appeared in the village again. After the Nanma Campaign in 1947, nine enemy divisions gathered in Yiyuan, and the villages, large and small, were filled with enemies. Zuo Taichuan led five militiamen and was trapped in the sorghum fields. Another group of four militiamen was captured and shot by the enemy. They hadn't eaten for four days in the continuous heavy rain, and the militiamen all said to each other, "There's no way out! We're doomed!" Zuo Taichuan's eyes flashed with flames of hatred as he gritted his teeth and said, "Class struggle is a struggle for life and death. I am a Communist Party member, and I swear not to bow my head to the enemy. The Party will not forget us, our troops will definitely return, we cannot die yet!" Finally, Zuo Taichuan survived the crisis. Villagers secretly crawled out of the village at night to join his team, and old women secretly sent them dry food. With the continuous victories of the main force, Zuo Taichuan and his explosion team became active again, attacking the "Returning Home Corps" day and night, and finally cooperating with the main force to capture strongholds and clear the enemy.

    Zuo Taichuan is a leader who grew up from the masses, and he is closely linked to the masses. When the war in Shandong ended victoriously, he immediately dragged his disabled right leg to lead the people in healing the wounds of war. In 1949, he was already the district party secretary, and the explosion team members he led became outstanding party members and cadres in the district and township. He also led them, leading the masses to fight against disaster, and their district had survived the severe spring famine of 1950 and restored production. In this new struggle, Zuo Taichuan is a first-class hero in production and disaster relief in the entire district. (Attached photo)

　　左太传和他的“飞行爆炸大王队”
    战争时期是英勇的战斗员，胜利后是恢复生产的领导者。
    山东民兵英雄“飞行爆炸大王”左太传，在抗日战争和解放战争中，都曾经以他的地雷阵狠狠地打击敌人。从一九四四年到一九四七年中间，左太传和他所率领的“飞行爆炸大王队”，共埋了地雷一百八十次、七百五十个，炸死炸伤日、伪、蒋匪军二百三十五人，毁汽车四辆，马车两辆，炮一门，缴步枪四十余枝。更重要的是：左太传以自身的倔强和勇敢，教会人民怎样去打击敌人，以保卫自己的生命和财产。
    远在六七年前，这个青年的名字，就随着地雷的爆裂，在山东沂源县人民中传颂着。那时，左太传当联防队长，他第一个学会了埋雷。他把地雷埋在村里，炸跑了抢粮的敌人。埋在树林里，炸死了伐树的鬼子。民兵们争着学埋地雷，各村老百姓也争着跑来向左太传领教。于是沂源县人民和敌人展开了地雷战，打得敌人缩在据点里不敢出来。一九四五年在该区全区民兵大会上，他被群众公推为爆炸队长，从此他正式脱离生产，带领民兵和敌人作战。
    左太传的地雷，不只是防御的地雷，而且是进攻的地雷。一九四六年十月，左太传的爆炸队奉命远征到博（山）莱（芜）边区，去打击进犯的蒋匪。老百姓报告说：八徒伪乡公所杀害革命家属。左太传说：“铲掉他！”黑夜，左太传带着两个民兵钻进伪乡公所，逮来了岗哨，留下了地雷。第二天，伪乡警去开门，炸倒门口。伪乡长到椅子上一坐，连人带椅子炸个粉碎，屉斗里、土炕上，一起轰炸起来。从此左太传的飞雷从博山炸到莱芜，从沂源炸到新泰，敌人给炸的提心吊胆，昼夜不安。匪军们暗地里偷说：“可别黑心，黑心逢上左阎王。”
    左太传的地雷阵，曾经挡住过全副美械化的国民党匪帮的正规军，而且一直挡了二十四天。
    一九四七年五月，侵占新泰的匪十一师，企图打通新（泰）莱（芜）公路继续北犯。左太传领着民兵爆炸队赶去阻击敌人。经一天一夜，左太传领着民兵从转山子到槐树岭，摆下十几里路的地雷阵。进攻的敌人抢上转山子，踏响了四十八个连环雷，转山子像火山爆发，四十三个匪军全躺下了。敌人走到公路上，又炸响了旗子雷、人头雷、窝雷……。汽车、马车爬上槐树岭，连人带车翻到山下。敌人几次出动，都被地雷炸回去。左太传爆破队的地雷阵像一座铜墙铁壁，挡住敌人去路。
    蒋匪二十五军从莱芜进攻沂源，左太传的民兵队又赶到沂莱公路上，两天两夜没合眼，埋下三百多地雷，摆下五十五里长的地雷阵。炸的敌人炮车翻到河里，尸体躺在路上。匪军一个班去占兵盘山，上去就不下来，后面敌人上去一看，十一个人全躺下了。地雷炸的敌人魂飞胆裂，走路慢慢挪，听见雷响就爬下，进攻了八天，只前进了四十里。左太传又领着民兵到处打冷枪射击敌人。
    随着地雷的爆炸，左太传的名字在广大人民中间响亮起来。鲁中军区授给左太传“飞行爆破大王”的称号，命名他所率领的爆破队为：“左太传飞行爆破大王队”。从此，“左太传飞行爆破大王队”的红旗飘到那里，那里人民就打着锣鼓来欢迎，他们给人民带来了信心，他们给敌人带去了灾难。
    左太传十五岁就参加了共产党领导的敌后少年先锋队，以后他一直是青救会、民兵队的领袖。十八岁他参加了中国共产党。那种为党从幼小培育起来的不屈的精神，和从本阶级带来的对敌人仇恨的火焰，在这个青年英雄的血液里滚腾着。在最艰苦危急的时候，他像铁人一样坚持斗争。一九四七年八、九月间，鲁中南大部陷入敌手，土改中被镇压下去的地主恶霸又抬起头来，成立“还乡团”，杀害革命家属，向人民报复倒算账。这时，正是毛主席所指出的：“天空似乎黑暗的时候”，主力军出击外线，许多领导机关也撤到北面去了。左太传当时是区武装部长，他奉命带领区民兵爆炸队返回敌后沂源坚持斗争。他向党委书记宣誓：“宁死决不向敌人示弱！”几天后，他把爆炸队分成许多小组，出现在敌人腹心黄庄区，穿行在高粱地里，山草丛里，袭击敌人汽车，捕捉敌人岗哨，散发传单。左太传钻进敌人盘据的村庄，打死出卖人民利益的叛徒，从伪乡公所里拖出罪大恶极的坏蛋董永昌、李宝山，执行枪决。他向地主们警告：“共产党永不会走，天不会天天阴，那个坏良心，小心脑袋！”在这艰苦的时期里，他领着民兵队像一个严峻的法官，裁判着叛逆分子，保卫着人民，鼓舞着群众的斗志。
    这个人民的英雄，像一把利刀翻腾在敌人心脏。惊恐的敌人到处悬赏捉拿左太传，出动成团的兵力包围搜索，三番五次的造谣说：“左阎王被打死了。”借以削弱人民的希望。但是，第二天，左太传又出现在村上。一九四七年南麻战役后，敌人九个师麇集沂源，大村小村住满了敌人，左太传带五个民兵被困在高粱地里，另一组四个民兵被敌人捉去枪杀了。连天大雨中他们已经第四天没吃饭了，民兵们都面对面地说：“一条活路也没了！死定了！”左太传眼睛里闪着仇恨的火焰咬着牙说：“阶级斗争是生死斗争。我是共产党员，誓死不向敌人低头。党不会忘掉我们，我们的队伍一定会回来，我们还不能死！”终于，左太传熬过了难关。村民们黑夜偷爬出村来参加他的队伍，老婆婆偷着给他们送干粮来。随着主力军连续的胜利，左太传又带他的爆破队活跃起来，日夜打击“还乡团”，最后配合主力军打下据点，扫清了敌人。
    左太传是群众中生长出来的领袖，他和群众是紧密连在一起的。当战争在山东胜利结束以后，他立刻拖着一条残废的右腿，领导人民医治战争的创伤。一九四九年，他已是区委书记，他所领导的爆炸队员们，都成了区乡优秀的党员和干部。他又带领他们，领导着群众和灾荒斗争，他们区里已经度过一九五零年严重的春荒，恢复了生产。在这一新的斗争中，左太传是全区生产救灾中的一等功臣。（附图片）
