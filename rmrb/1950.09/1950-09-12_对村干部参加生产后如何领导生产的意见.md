Northeast China has proposed the working principle of "village cadres leading production through participation in production" this year, and some experience has been gained. The main cadres in the rural areas of Northeast China were originally semi-detached from production, and they still emphasize "leading production through participation in production". Village cadres in other areas who are not detached from production should further learn from the Northeast. We are now introducing the opinions of the Organization Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee on this work for your reference, to study how to further solve the problem of village cadres leading mass production without delaying their own production.

I. Specific Requirements for Village Cadres to Participate in Production

The important significance of village cadres participating in production and going deep into the production process is to do a good job and lead production more effectively. If this aspect is ignored, the cadres will be reduced to ordinary farmers, losing their leadership significance. According to preliminary experience, this should include the following points:

1.  Cadres participating in production should refer to participating in the main labor of a certain agricultural season, such as plowing and harrowing during the spring plowing season, etc. More importantly, at the beginning of each specific production work in a production season (such as seed selection, sowing, summer hoeing, etc.), cadres should first act as models for implementing the resolutions of the People's Representatives Meeting. Judging from the experience of spring plowing and summer hoeing, the leading model role at this time has great leadership significance. For example, Wang Zhenchun, the village head of Zhiyuan Fifth District, mobilized topdressing during summer hoeing and took the lead in topdressing one and a half hectares of sorghum with kang ash, promoting the topdressing of 23.8% of all cultivated land in the village. When the production season changes, special attention should be paid to allowing village cadres to have time to participate in production. During this period, allowing village cadres to devote all their efforts to production can drive the production army forward.

2.  The main thing for cadres participating in production is to gain production experience and understand the production mood of the masses in order to lead production well. Therefore, village cadres must participate in a group and help the group to do well. In order to combine it with his own production, the group that the cadre participates in should preferably be the group he leads. In this way, the leadership experience is combined with his own production.

3.  At the production discussion meeting, village cadres should include the situation in their own group as part of the report. This can overcome the fact that many village cadres nominally participate in the group, but in reality do not go deep into it, and therefore it is difficult to grasp the specific situation and conduct specific leadership. For example, the branch committee members of Zhaodong Ninth Village report on the situation of the groups they lead at each meeting, exchange experiences, and understand the specific situation, thus leading all party members to promote the work of the entire village.

II. What Should Be Required of Village Cadres in Leading Production?

Judging from the current situation, there should basically be two requirements:

Village cadres such as the secretary, village head, and clerk (or finance and grain) should bear more responsibility, because these cadres receive some subsidies from the public. The requirements for them in leading production should include:

1.  In addition to specific division of labor and leadership, there should also be regular comprehensive inspections, going deep into the fields and into farmers' households. The secretary should check whether the selection of seeds, planting, and weeding of party members are in accordance with the branch's resolutions, and whether the implementation of the resolutions of the Representative Meeting is guaranteed. The village head should check whether the resolutions of the Representative Meeting have been implemented, and what problems still exist to be implemented. Without this regular on-site inspection, it is impossible to understand the actual situation of production in the whole village. Of course, the secretary and the village head can sometimes divide the work for inspection, and they should also use rainy and windy days when work cannot be done to inspect. This comprehensive inspection can be done once or twice a month, depending on the size of the village.

2.  There should be a regular working system (such as administrative meetings, representative meetings, branch committee meetings, branch general meetings, etc.) to study work. The village head and secretary should also have brainstorming sessions to exchange information, spread experience, and grasp the overall situation at any time. As for how many days apart, this should be determined according to the specific situation of the village. Some are set for five days, and some are set for three days. They can use the evening or after dinner to connect.

3.  How much time should cadres such as the secretary and village head spend on leading production in a month? This varies depending on the size of the village, the distance from the district (because village cadres have to go to the district to attend meetings), and the work foundation. According to preliminary investigations, in villages that are close to the district and have concentrated villages, the secretary and chairman also need three to five days a month. If the villages are scattered and far from the district, it takes five to eight days (some villages are eighty or ninety miles away from the district). County and district leaders must pay attention to this situation and should not hold meetings during the most intense production time, and should try to prevent cadres from delaying work during the main labor time. But it is impossible not to delay work at all.

The general village committee members should have different requirements from the secretary, village head, etc. The method adopted by each county is that whoever is in that village is assigned to that village, requiring the committee members to be responsible for the village. For example, Peng Xijiang, the production committee member of Yanhai Village, Fifth District of Zhaoyuan, trained backbones in his group and took the lead in promoting topdressing of 20 hectares in the village, with himself topdressing 4 hectares. Of the 82 hectares in the village, the first weeding was completed by the seventh day of the fifth lunar month, and 17 hectares were weeded the second time, and 13 hectares were hoed.

III. How to Lead Production After Participating in Production?

Village cadres participating in production and leading production have their own experiences in various places. It should be pointed out that the essence of this experience is the specific process of combining general leadership with specific guidance and combining leadership with the masses, as mentioned in the Central Committee's decision on leadership methods. If it is said that leaders at all levels cannot do without these two principles, then in the process of village cadres participating in production and leading production, this problem is even more obvious. The following three problems must be gradually solved in order to further improve the participation of cadres in production and leading production, and turn it into a habit and style.

(1) Teach village cadres to learn the leadership method of combining point and surface.

"Point" means that village cadres go deep into the mass production groups, participate in the main labor of mass production, learn from experience and set an example to lead the masses.

"Surface" means that the village should have regular mass inspections, hold branch general meetings and people's representative meetings regularly, and organize forces to lead and study the production work in the whole village.

The point and the surface are consistent. Without the experience of the group and typical demonstration examples, there is no specific leadership, and the farmers do not believe it, thinking that you are "talking", "bragging", "bureaucratic", and the result is still coercion. If there is no regular mass inspection and regular meetings to promote work and lead the masses forward, then it will be left to its own devices, that is, abandoning leadership.

(2) Seriously and regularly summarize the working methods of the mass line that combines leadership with the masses.

Village cadres participate in production and go deep into the mass production process. In this respect, cadres are members of mass production, but an important point for cadres to participate in production is to gain and learn from the production experience of the masses in order to lead the production of the whole village well, and combine their own experience and the experience of the broad masses in the branch general meeting, people's representative meeting, branch committee, and administrative committee, and regularly summarize them to make decisions, which will become the resolutions and experience of the whole village. The village cadres must also take this resolution back to the group to take the lead in implementing it, to influence and promote the broad masses to actively respond to the resolutions of the branch and the People's Representatives Meeting, and turn them into the actions of the broad masses. Village cadres participating in production and leading production is also a specific process of combining leadership with the masses. This point should be gradually understood and learned by our broad cadres in the summary of practical work.

　　对村干部参加生产后如何领导生产的意见
    黑龙江省委组织部
    东北区今年提出“村干部以生产领导生产”的工作方针，已取得了一些经验。东北农村的主要干部，本来是半脱离生产的，他们仍然强调“以生产领导生产”，其他地区不脱离生产的村干部，就更应该进一步向东北学习。兹介绍黑龙江省委组织部对这一工作的意见，供各地参考，研究如何进一步解决村干部领导群众生产而又不耽误自己生产的问题。
    编者
    一、对村干部参加生产的具体要求
    村干部参加了生产，深入生产过程重要的意义，是为了把工作做好，更有力的领导好生产；如忽略了这一方面，就会将干部降为普通的农民，失去了领导意义。根据初步的经验，应包括这几点：
    １、干部参加生产，应指参加一定农业季节的主要劳动，如春耕时期的耲地、扣地等，而更重要的是在一个生产季节的每一个具体生产工作的开端（如选种、播种、夏锄等），干部应首先做为执行人民代表会决议的模范。根据春耕夏锄经验来看，在这时的带头模范作用，领导意义是很大的。如肇源五区支援村村长王振春夏锄时动员追肥，自己带头用炕洞土先追了一垧半地高粱，推动全村上了全部耕地百分之二十三点八的追肥。在生产季节转变时，要特别注意让村干部有参加生产的时间。在这个时期内，让村干部将全部力量投入生产，才能带动生产大军前进。
    ２、干部参加生产，主要的是取得生产的经验，了解群众的生产心情，以便很好的来领导生产。因此村干部一定要参加一个小组，而且要帮助小组搞好。为了与他本身的生产结合起来，干部参加的小组，最好应是他自己领导的小组。这样，取得领导经验与自己本身的生产就结合起来了。
    ３、村干部在讨论生产的会议上，要将自己小组内的情形，做为汇报内容之一。这样就可克服不少的村干部名义上是参加到小组中去，而实际并未深入下去，因之也就难以掌握具体情况，进行具体领导。如肇东九村支部委员，在每次会上都是汇报自己领导的小组情况，交流了经验，了解了具体情况，因之领导了全体党员推动了全村工作。
    二、对村干部领导生产应当要求些什么？
    从目前情况看来，基本上应有两种要求：
    支书、村长、文书（或财粮）这些村干部他们应负较多的责任，因为这些干部公家多少有点补助。对他们在领导生产的要求上，应包括：
    １、除了具体分工领导，还应有定期的全面的检查，要深入田间，深入农户。支书要检查党员选种、种地、铲草，趟地是否合乎支部的决议，是否保证了代表会决议的执行。村长要检查代表会的决议是否实现，还存在什么问题要进行贯彻。如果没有这个定期的实地检查，就不能了解生产在全村进行的实际情况。当然支书和村长有时可以分工检查，更要利用下雨和风天不能干活时去检查。这种全面的检查，因村子的大小不一，每月有一二次即可。
    ２、要有定时的工作制度（如行政会、代表会、支委会、支部大会等）研究工作，村长、支书还应有碰头会交换情况，传播经验，随时掌握全面情况。至于多少天一次，这应按村屯之大小具体情况来决定。有的定为五天，有的定为三天。可利用晚间或晚饭后碰头联系。
    ３、支书、村长这些干部，在领导生产上，一个月到底得用多少时间？这因屯子大小不同，距区上远近不同（因村干部是得上区上开会的），工作基础不同而不同。据初步的调查，距区上近而屯子集中的村，支书、主席一月也得三天至五天的工夫。如屯子散而距区又远的，得五天到八天的工夫（有的村距区八、九十里）。县区领导上必须注意这种情况，不要在生产最紧张的时间来开会，应尽量使干部不要在主要劳动的时间上误工。但一点工也不误是不可能的。
    关于一般村的委员，应和支书、村长等要有不同的要求，各县所采用的办法，即是谁在那个屯即分到那个屯，要求委员们能负起本屯的责任来。如肇源五区沿海村生产委员彭喜江，他在本组培养骨干，自己带头推动全屯上追肥二十垧，自己就上四垧，全屯八十二垧地，到旧历五月初七铲趟完头遍，二遍铲出十七垧，趟出十三垧。
    三、参加了生产如何领导生产？
    村干部参加生产又领导生产，目前各地都有了自己的经验。应该指出，这一经验实质上也就是中央领导方法决定中所提到的一般领导与具体指导相结合，领导和群众相结合的具体过程。如果说各级领导都离不了这两个原则，那么在村干部参加生产领导生产这一过程中，对这一问题表现的就更明显。以下三个问题必须逐步的求得解决，才能将干部参加生产、领导生产更进一步的提高，成为一种习惯和作风。
    （一）要教会村干部学会点面结合的领导方法。
    “点”就是村干部深入到群众生产小组中去，参加群众生产的主要劳动，摸取经验作出样子来领导群众。
    “面”就是村里要有定期群众性的检查，定期的开好支部大会，人民代表会议，组织力量来领导研究全村里的生产工作。
    点面是一致的，没有小组的经验和典型示范的例子，就没有具体领导，农民就不相信，认为你是：“说嘴”、“吹牛”、“官二流子”，结果还是强迫命令。如没有定期群众性的检查，定期的会议，推动工作，领导群众前进，那就要自流，就是放弃了领导。
    （二）要认真的经常总结领导与群众相结合的群众路线的工作方法。
    村干部参加生产，深入于群众生产过程中去。在这点上干部是群众生产中的一员，但干部参加生产重要的一点，是在取得与学习群众生产的经验，来领导好全村生产，将他们自己的经验和广大群众的经验，在支部大会，人民代表会上，支委会，行政委员会上，经常的进行总结，作出决定，就成为全村的决议，全村的经验。村干部又要将这个决议带回小组去带头执行，来影响与推动广大的群众积极响应支部、人民代表会的决议，变成为广大群众的行动。村干部参加生产又领导生产，也就是领导与群众相结合的一个具体过程。这点要在实际工作总结中，来使我们广大的干部逐渐领会与学习。
