The "Publishing Exhibition," sponsored by the Preparatory Committee of the First National Publishing Conference, is scheduled to open at 10:00 AM today (the 17th) at Beihai Park in this city. The exhibition is scheduled to last for ten days. This exhibition, in conjunction with the First National Publishing Conference which opened in Beijing on the 15th, further highlights its significance. It demonstrates the growth process of the new China's publishing industry, points out the direction of the publishing industry serving the people, and its unlimited development prospects. The exhibition mainly embodies the historical development of China's publishing and printing industry. All exhibits are displayed in four halls:

	The first hall systematically displays representative publications from various revolutionary periods in the past century, during which the Chinese people heroically struggled against foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries, some of which have become rare historical materials. From these publications, one can see the close connection between the publishing industry and the Chinese people's revolution, and the development process and trend of the New Democratic culture.

	The second hall mainly showcases the development of publishing and printing technology and the process of book publishing, pointing out that China is the country that invented printing technology the earliest. The new China's publishing industry should not only improve in content, but also strive for excellence in form.

	The third hall showcases ancient Chinese culture, connecting with the exhibits in the first hall. Exhibits include: Yin Dynasty oracle bones, Han Dynasty wooden slips, rubbings of Han and Wei stone classics, Six Dynasties and Tang Dynasty manuscripts, as well as Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasty block-printed books, which are precious heritages of our nation's more than 3,000 years of culture.

	The fourth hall displays various Soviet publications, divided into categories such as Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's works, reprinted literary heritage books, translated foreign books, and foreign language publications, demonstrating the development of the advanced socialist country's publishing industry and the richness of its spiritual life, for the domestic publishing industry to study and learn from.
