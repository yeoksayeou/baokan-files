Wu Kunshan, Heroic Factory Protector
    ——Introduction to Industrial Representatives at the Conference of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, No. 11

    On the eve of Chongqing's liberation, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops fled in panic, they dispatched a large number of soldiers to plant explosives in Chongqing's 21st Arsenal. The Dabanciao Ammunition Depot and the old and new power plants of the factory were destroyed by the Chiang bandits, but the factory's largest rifle division was preserved thanks to the heroic protection of the worker brothers. The leader of this factory protection was Wu Kunshan, the 61-year-old hero of the rifle division.

    Wu Kunshan's heroic factory protection actions were admired and loved by more than 20,000 employees and their families. Whenever Wu Kunshan was mentioned, everyone, young and old, would give a thumbs up and praise him. On November 29th last year, on the eve of Chongqing's liberation, the bandit troops planted 141 boxes of explosives in the central area of the rifle division of the factory. Wu Kunshan lived in the division and was worried about the piles of explosives. At night, another group of bandit troops came and asked him why he didn't leave. Comrade Wu said: "The factory is my home, I want to take good care of it. No matter how dangerous it is, I will protect it." At that time, the factory was full of bandit troops. At 11 o'clock at night, the Dabanciao Ammunition Depot and the old and new power plants exploded. Wu Kunshan still stood guard in the division. He believed that one person's life and death was not worth regretting. If all 141 boxes of explosives in the division exploded, not only would half of the 21st Arsenal be destroyed, but thousands of worker brothers would lose their jobs and their lives would be in danger. He resolutely guarded the factory. On December 1st, Chongqing was liberated, and he finally felt relieved, but the explosives in the division had not been moved out, and the danger had not been eliminated. He suggested that the administration should move them away as soon as possible, but no one dared to move them. When everyone was worried about the pile of explosives, he stepped forward and said: "You young men have a long time to serve the country. I, Wu Kunshan, am 60 years old. In order to protect the property of the country, it is worth dying. Please everyone stay away and let me move a few boxes to try. If it explodes, it will kill me alone." So, he risked his life to move each box of explosives and send it dozens of steps away, handing it over to other comrades to move away. When he moved the first box, the workers were worried about him, but Wu Kunshan remained calm, fully demonstrating the high degree of self-sacrifice of the working class. Therefore, he moved many worker brothers, and spontaneously participated in the factory protection work. Within two hours, all 141 boxes of explosives were moved away. The yellow explosives buried by the bandit troops in the general office of the rifle repair shop were also taken out together under the influence of Wu Kunshan. In this way, the property of the people's motherland was protected, and the lives and work of the factory's worker brothers were protected.

    After liberation, he was elected as the worker representative of the first Chongqing Municipal People's Representative Conference. He humbly and with a smile, said to the worker brothers: "This is not my personal glory, Wu Kunshan, it is a great happy event for the proletariat to turn over. I will study hard and bring back some valuable information for everyone."

    Wu Kunshan is from Echeng, Hubei Province. He has worked in the arsenal for 25 years and was born in a poor family and had no opportunity to study. During the reactionary rule, the working people were oppressed and exploited and could not make a living, so he used his meager wages to help the working brothers he could help, and tried to be thrifty himself. To this day, he still maintains his consistent hard life, using most of his wages to help worker brothers in difficult circumstances, fully demonstrating the spirit of friendship of the working class.

　　英勇护厂的吴坤山
    ——工农兵劳模代表会议工业代表介绍之十一
    重庆解放前夕，蒋匪军在仓惶逃走时，派出了大批匪军在重庆二十一兵工厂装置炸药。该厂大板桥药库及新旧发电厂就是被蒋匪破坏的，但该厂规模最大的步枪所却在工人弟兄英勇的保护下，保存了下来。这个领导护厂的，便是步枪所六十一岁老英雄吴坤山。
    吴坤山英勇的护厂行动，得到了全厂二万余职工和职工眷属的敬仰与爱戴，只要提起吴坤山，不管老小，没有人不翘起大拇指叫好的。去年十一月二十九日重庆解放前夕，匪军到该厂步枪所中心区装置了一百四十一箱炸药。吴坤山住在所里，对着一堆堆的炸药发愁。晚上，又来了一批匪军，问他为什么不离开，吴同志说：“工厂是我的家，我要好好的看守，无论多大的危险，我也要保卫它。”当时厂里满布匪军，晚上十一点钟，大板桥药库及新旧两发电厂爆炸了。吴坤山仍坚守在所内，他认为一个人的生死不足惜，假如所内一百四十一箱炸药全都爆炸了，不但使二十一厂去掉大半，而且将使数千工人弟兄失业，生命也要受到损失，他坚决的看守着工厂。十二月一日，重庆解放了，他的心才放了下来，但所内炸药未搬出，危险还没有解除，他建议行政上应赶快搬走，可是谁都不敢去动一下。大家都对着这堆炸药发愁的时候，他挺身而出，他说：“你们年青小伙子为国家出力的日子正长，我吴坤山六十岁了，为了保护国家的财产，死也值得，请大家避开，让我来搬几箱试试看，要炸就炸死我一个人。”于是他冒着生命危险，搬动每一箱炸药，送到数十步以外，交给其他的同志搬走。当他搬动第一箱时工友都为他耽心，但吴坤山却处之泰然，充分的表现了高度的工人阶级的自我牺牲精神，因此，感动许多工人弟兄，自动参加保厂工作。在二小时内将一百四十一箱炸药全部搬完了。修枪所总办公厅等处匪军所埋的黄色炸药，也在吴坤山的感召下一齐搬了出来。这样保卫了人民祖国的财产，保卫了全厂工人弟兄的生命和工作。
    解放后，他被选为重庆市第一届各界人民代表会议的工人代表，他谦逊的，满面笑容的对工人弟兄说：“这不是我吴坤山个人的荣耀，是无产阶级翻了身的大喜事，我要好好的学习，给大家带回一些宝贵的资料。”
    吴坤山是湖北鄂城人，他在兵工厂工作已二十五年，出身在贫苦的家庭里，没有读书的机会。在反动派统治时期，劳动人民被压迫、剥削得过不了生活，他就以自己仅有的工资，帮助他能帮助的劳动弟兄，对自己则尽量节俭。到今天他还是保持着自己一贯的刻苦生活，把工资的大部分都用来帮助生活困苦的工人弟兄，充分表现了工人阶级的友爱精神。（摘自重庆新华日报）
