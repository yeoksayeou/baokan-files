　　Rural Briefs from Various Locations

　　Most areas of Zhejiang Province received timely rainfall on the 17th and 18th of this month. The amount of rainfall was appropriate, which is extremely beneficial to the growth of autumn crops. This rainfall has relieved the threat of drought that many areas of the province had suffered due to more than a month without rain.

　　Since the beginning of summer, most areas of Guanzhong in Shaanxi Province and parts of southern and northern Shaanxi Province have experienced severe drought due to prolonged lack of rain. In early and mid-August, rain fell successively in Hanzhong, Pingchuan, Baocheng, Nanzheng, Xixiang, Fufeng, Ganxian, and areas near Xi'an. The largest amount of rainfall reached 20 millimeters, and the drought has gradually begun to ease.

　　The State-owned Gaoli District Farm has trial-planted over 11,700 mu of rice this year using the dry direct seeding method (i.e., watering after direct seeding and emergence). Currently, the rice seedlings are growing well, and this new planting method has been successfully tested. The dry direct seeding method for rice is an advanced Soviet agricultural technique. It uses machinery for direct seeding, which can save labor for transplanting seedlings and has the advantages of stronger seedlings, firmer roots, drought resistance, flood resistance, and resistance to rice blast compared to other cultivation methods.

　　Jin Chunde, a farmer from Caojia Village in the suburbs of Lushun City, Northeast China, grew wheat with double ears this year, each ear measuring three to four inches long. This is the result of his continuous attention to seed selection over the years. When he started growing wheat in 1947, he selected large-grain white-skinned wheat seeds. In the second year, he carried out individual plant selection, and last year he carried out grain selection, resulting in an increase in yield every year.

　　各地农村简讯
    浙江省大部地区于本月十七、十八两日，普获时雨，雨量适度，极有利于秋季作物的成长。这次落雨已解除了该省不少地区曾因月余不雨而遭受的旱灾威胁。
    陕西省关中大部地区和陕南、陕北部分地区入夏以来曾因久旱不雨，呈现严重旱象。八月上旬和中旬，汉中、平川、褒城、南郑、西乡、扶风、干县及西安附近等地相继落雨，雨量最大的达二十公厘，旱象已渐见减轻。
    国营高里区农场今年试用水稻旱直播方法（即在直播出苗后再行灌水），播种水稻一万一千七百余亩。现稻秧发育良好，这新的播种法已被试验成功。按水稻旱直播法是苏联的先进农业技术。系用机械直接播种，可节省插秧的人工，并较其他栽培方法更具有苗健、根固、抗旱、抗涝、抗稻热病的优点。
    东北旅顺市郊曹家村农民金纯德今年所种的小麦长出双穗，每个麦穗都有三、四寸长。这是他连年注意选种的结果。他在一九四七年开始种麦时曾挑选了大粒白皮麦种，第二年进行棵选，去年又进行粒选，产量每年都有提高。
