Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: Following the footsteps of American imperialism, the British Labour government is attempting to solve the shortage of soldiers in its aggressive war by increasing military pay and extending terms of service.

According to a London dispatch from the British Information Service: Attlee gave a special broadcast on the evening of August 30th specifically about the pay increase. In the broadcast, he inadvertently revealed that the Labour government's war policy was unpopular. He pointed out that although a lot of work had been done in recruiting soldiers in the past, "we still haven't recruited enough new soldiers." In order to "make military service attractive," the method he proposed was the lure of money - increased pay. Attlee listed in detail the amount of pay increases for regular soldiers of various ranks and announced that it would be implemented from September 1st.

Attlee listed many benefits of being cannon fodder in his speech: "Those in military service receive food, clothing, and accommodation, and if married, they can also receive a wife's allowance, and their prospects up to the age of fifty-five are very promising." "Their chances of promotion are much greater than when living a civilian life." He also specifically mentioned that the Air Force can get a large bonus after each short-term service is completed.

However, Attlee also admitted that relying on such methods to increase new soldiers would "not solve the problem." Therefore, he believed that in addition to measures already taken to extend the retirement of some personnel in the army, navy, and air force and to call up reservists, the national military service period should be extended. This regulation applies to personnel serving from October 1st of this year.

British bourgeois newspapers revealed a lack of confidence in the success of this method when commenting on this event. According to a report by the Telecommunications Agency, *The Manchester Guardian*'s editorial stated: "People's aversion to military life is too deep, and no such inducement can overcome it." The newspaper and the *Daily Express* both believe that increasing pay is like "gambling," and whether it will succeed is unpredictable. In an editorial commenting on the matter, *The Times* called for attention to the fact that the regular members of the troops are "still decreasing" and pointed out that extending the term of military service may cause a loss of manpower in industry.

In its commentary, the British *Daily Worker* exposed the Labour government's participation in the American expanded war plan, pointing out that increasing soldiers is "to carry out the wars that the British Empire is already engaged in in Malaya and Korea, and other colonial wars that may be dragged into by the United States." The newspaper said: "This is not defending Britain, but completely destroying Britain in the war provoked by the United States."

### 英政府图驱使人民当炮灰宣布增加军饷及延长兵役

　　英政府图驱使人民当炮灰宣布增加军饷及延长兵役
    【新华社三日讯】英国工党政府追随美国帝国主义之后，图以增加军饷和延长服役期限，来解决从事侵略战争中的兵员短缺问题。
    据英国新闻处伦敦消息：艾德礼于八月三十日晚专门为增饷事而作了广播演说。在广播中，他无意中道出了工党政府所追随的战争政策不得人心。他指出过去在征募兵员方面虽然做了不少工作，“然而，我们招募到的新兵仍然不够”。为了“使服役成为吸引人的事情”，他提出的办法就是金钱的诱惑——加饷。艾德礼详细列举了各个等级正规军人薪饷增加数额，并宣布自九月一日起就实行。
    艾德礼在演说中罗列许多当炮灰的好处：“服兵役的人获得衣食住的供应，假如已婚，还可以领得妻子津贴，并且他们至五十五岁为止的前途，大有希望”。“他们升迁的机会比过平民生活的时候是大得多了”。他并且特别提到空军每在一个短期勤务完毕后就可得到大量奖金。
    但是，艾德礼也承认靠这样的办法增加新兵还“不能解决问题”，因此，他认为必需除已采取陆海空军部分展期退役以及召集后备军入伍等措施外，应延长国民兵役期。这一规定适用于自本年十月一日起服役的人员。
    英国资产阶级报纸在评论这一事件时，透露了对于这种办法之能否成功缺乏信心。据电通社报道，《曼彻斯特卫报》社论称：“人民对军事生活的反感太深，任何此类的引诱都无法克服”。该报和《每日快报》都认为增加薪饷好比“赌博”，成功与否，未可先知。《泰晤士报》在评论此事的社论中要求注意部队正规成员“目前仍在减少中”，同时指出延长兵役期限可能引起工业方面人力的损失。
    英国《工人日报》在评论中揭露工党政府参加美国扩大战争计划，指出增加兵员是“为了进行英帝国已在马来亚及朝鲜从事的战争和可能被美国拖入的其他殖民战争”。该报说：“这不是保卫英国，而是在美国所挑拨的战争中使英国完全灭毁。”
