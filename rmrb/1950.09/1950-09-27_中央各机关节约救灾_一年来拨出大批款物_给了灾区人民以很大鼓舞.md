Xinhua News Agency, 24th. The central government organs' movement to practice economy and aid disaster relief has achieved great results over the past year. As of September 20th, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has received the following funds and materials for disaster relief from central organs (including disaster relief funds and materials previously received by the North China People's Government and the Beijing Disaster Relief Committee): RMB 3,000,860,000 yuan, 4,184,500 jin of grain, 77,500 pieces of clothing, and 3,300 other items. The aforementioned grain, funds, and materials were allocated as they were received to the production and disaster relief committees in various disaster areas according to the severity of the disaster. More was allocated to the North China and East China regions last winter and this spring, and since new floods occurred in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, and Henan this summer, most has been allocated to the above-mentioned regions.

After these grains, funds, and materials arrived in the disaster areas, they effectively encouraged and promoted production for self-relief in various disaster areas. The Northwest Military and Political Committee said in its summary report on disaster relief work: "Although the amount of funds saved by the central government organs was not large, when it arrived in the Linxia disaster area, the masses shouted, 'This is what Chairman Mao saved and sent to us...' This has greatly promoted the unity between the Hui and Han people in organizing production." After receiving the above-mentioned grain and funds, the disaster victims in various places have sent letters to the Central People's Government to express their gratitude.

　　中央各机关节约救灾  一年来拨出大批款物
    给了灾区人民以很大鼓舞
    【新华社二十四日讯】中央各机关的节约救灾运动，一年以来已收到很大的成绩。截至九月二十日为止，中央人民政府内务部前后共收到此项机关节约救灾的款物（连前华北人民政府和北京市救灾委员会所收救灾款物）计为：人民币三十亿零八千六百余万元，粮食四百一十八万四千五百余斤，衣物七万七千五百余件，和其他物品三千三百余件。上项粮款物品均随收随拨，按灾情轻重，拨予了各灾区的生产救灾委员会。去冬今春以拨给华北、华东两区比较多，自今夏皖北、苏北、河南发生新的水灾后，大部均拨给了上述各地区。
    这些粮款和物资到达灾区后，对各灾区进行生产自救起了有效的鼓舞和推动作用。西北军政委员会在救灾工作总结报告中说：“中央机关节约款拨来，虽然为数不多，但到达临夏灾区后，群众就喊着“这是毛主席节省下来给我们送来的……”，这对回汉团结组织生产上起了很大的推动作用。”各地灾民在获得上述粮款救济后，均曾致函中央人民政府表示感谢。
