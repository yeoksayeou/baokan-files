Dear Chairman Mao:
    We have decided to celebrate National Day and the opening of the National Model Workers Conference with a new production competition. We are very excited to report to you that we have generally more than doubled our production in the last competition. In this production competition, we guarantee that, on the basis of our initial victory, we will improve quality, make the finished products conform to specifications, and exceed the standard of the Red May Red Flag competition in quantity. We feel that our responsibility to the country is very important. Every furnace of steel we produce, or every steel bar we roll, adds strength to our motherland.

Your resounding call: "Strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation!" vigorously encourages us to move forward! We wish you good health forever!
    Respectfully,
