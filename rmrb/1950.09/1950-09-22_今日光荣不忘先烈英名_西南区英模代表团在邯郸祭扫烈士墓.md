　　Today's Glory Does Not Forget the Names of the Fallen Heroes
    Southwest Region Model Representative Delegation Pays Respects at Martyrs' Cemetery in Handan
    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] Our newspaper reporter Jin Feng reports: The Southwest Military Region and Second Field Army Combat Hero Representative Delegation, and the Southwest Region Model Worker Representative Delegation, paid respects at the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army Martyrs' Cemetery in the ancient city of Handan on September 20th.
    Among the 59 representatives in the Combat Hero Representative Delegation, 17 were Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberation Army soldiers. Among them were young commander Liu Zilin, blasting hero Chai Xuejiu, and others who were sons and daughters of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu border region. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, they fought alongside the heroic martyrs in the Taihang Mountains to resist the Japanese invaders. Today, they return in victory to pay tribute to their comrades-in-arms, and their feelings are naturally even more somber and indignant. The delegation arrived at the cemetery at 5:00 PM, and in the fading twilight, walked towards the Martyrs' Memorial Tower and cemetery.
    Chai Xuejiu, the blasting hero who joined the army in 1938, and model worker Yuan Kezhong, shed tears before the graves, offering tributes to their comrades who defended the border region with their blood and flesh.
    The heroes saw the magnificent and beautiful cemetery with its thousands of flowers and trees, silently remembering the glory of the martyrs who sacrificed for the people. They also carefully noted the personal inscriptions of dozens of responsible comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army, engraved on the steles and towers.
    He Guoxiu, an agricultural model representative of the Mosi ethnic group from the Yunnan border region, painstakingly copied Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's inscriptions, "Supreme Glory" and "You live in our memories, we live in your cause," into his small notebook.
    At the tomb of General Zuo Quan, Chief of Staff of the Eighth Route Army, the old Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu soldiers couldn't help but sing the song in memory of General Zuo Quan. The representatives silently listened with reverence to the intermittent and sorrowful lyrics, "General Zuo Quan's home is in Liling County, he was an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, he sacrificed gloriously for the country and the nation." Li Changrong, a veteran Red Army soldier who was the platoon leader in charge of covering General Zuo Quan's retreat when he was sacrificed, lingered before the general's tomb, unable to leave. The combat heroes who emerged during the Liberation War inquired earnestly about General Zuo Quan's deeds. The Southwest Region model representatives discussed among themselves: we must remember that today's glory of attending the National Model Workers Representative Conference was all bought with the blood of the sacrificed martyrs.
    The model heroes ate vegetarian for a day to commemorate the sacrificed martyrs and the difficult days of fighting in the Taihang Mountains in the past. Before leaving Handan, the delegation solemnly held a memorial ceremony. Before the martyrs' graves, the model heroes unanimously swore: We will resolutely inherit the legacy of the martyrs, defend the motherland, and defend the land that the martyrs defended with their heads and blood.

　　今日光荣不忘先烈英名
    西南区英模代表团在邯郸祭扫烈士墓
    【本报讯】本报记者金凤报道：西南军区及第二野战军战斗英雄代表团，和西南区劳动模范代表团九月二十日在邯郸古城，祭扫晋冀鲁豫人民解放军烈士陵园。
    战斗英雄代表团五十九位代表中，有十七位代表是晋冀鲁豫解放军战士，其中如青年指挥员刘子林、爆破英雄柴学久等，还是晋冀鲁豫边区的子弟兵，他们在八年抗战中，辗转太行山区曾经和英勇牺牲的烈士们并肩抗击日寇，今日胜利归来祭奠战友，心情自然更为沉痛感愤。代表团在下午五时到达陵园，在暮色苍茫中，走向烈士纪念塔和公墓。
    一九三八年开始参军的爆破英雄柴学久和模范工作者袁克忠在墓前，为奠祭着用血肉保卫边区的战友而下泪。
    英雄们看到千万株花木围抱着的、雄伟秀丽的陵园石墓，默念着为人民牺牲的烈士们的光荣，他们更一一记下了铭刻在碑塔上的中共中央和人民解放军几十位负责同志的亲笔题字。
    来自云南边境的摩西族农业劳模代表和国秀，吃力地把毛主席和朱总司令的题词：“无上光荣”、“你们活在我们的记忆中，我们活在你们的事业中”细描在他的小本上。
    在八路军参谋长左权将军的墓前，晋冀鲁豫的老战士不由放声唱起追悼左权将军之歌来，代表们默默地带着崇敬的神情，听着断续的、悲痛的“左权将军家住在醴陵县，他是中国共产党优秀党员，他为国家为民族光荣牺牲”的歌词。老红军出身、左权将军牺牲时当掩护排长的李长荣在将军墓前徘徊不忍去。在解放战争中涌现的战斗英雄们殷殷询问着左权将军的事迹；西南区劳模代表们在互相谈论着：要记住今日出席全国劳模代表会议的光荣都是牺牲烈士鲜血换来的。
    英模们素食一天，以纪念牺牲的烈士和过去太行山艰苦奋战的日子。代表团在离开邯郸前，郑重地举行祭扫典礼。英模们在烈士墓前一致宣誓：坚决继承烈士们的遗志，保卫祖国，保卫烈士们用头颅和鲜血保卫过的土地。
