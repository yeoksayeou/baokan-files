　　UN General Assembly 23rd Plenary Session
    Soviet Representative's Proposal to Deem Kuomintang Credentials Invalid Rejected by American Voting Machine
    [This newspaper reports] According to Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 25th: Comprehensive TASS dispatch from New York: At the UN General Assembly's plenary session on September 23rd, the first item discussed was the Credentials Committee's report on depriving the delegation of the People's Republic of China of its right to attend the General Assembly. Soviet Representative Malik reiterated that such a resolution, which did not take into consideration the current actual situation in China, was unfair and illegal. He proposed that the credentials of the Kuomintang representatives should be deemed invalid and stated that the Soviet Union would vote against recognizing the report of the Credentials Committee. Representatives from Poland and Belarus spoke in support of the Soviet proposal. However, under the manipulation of the American voting machine, the General Assembly rejected the Soviet proposal and adopted the Credentials Committee's report. The meeting then resumed general debate. Representatives from the Netherlands, Chile, and Belgium successively expressed support in their speeches for the American proposal to transform the United Nations into a tool of its aggression. The plenary session finally decided to adjourn and reconvene on the 25th.

　　联大二十三日全体会议
    苏代表建议国民党全权证书应视为无效，竟遭美表决机器否决
    【本报讯】据新华社二十五日电：综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会九月二十三日全体会议首先讨论全权证书委员会关于剥夺中华人民共和国出席联大代表团的决议报告，苏联代表马立克再度指出这种没有考虑中国目前实际情况的决议，是不公平的和非法的。他提议国民党代表的全权证书应视为无效，并声称苏联将投票反对认可全权证书委员会的报告。波兰、白俄罗斯代表发言支持苏联的提议。但是大会竟在美国开动多数表决机器下，否决了苏联的提案，并通过全权证书委员会的报告。会议随后即恢复一般辩论，荷兰、智利、比利时代表在发言中相继表示支持美国变联合国为其侵略工具的建议。全体会议最后决定休会到二十五日再开。
