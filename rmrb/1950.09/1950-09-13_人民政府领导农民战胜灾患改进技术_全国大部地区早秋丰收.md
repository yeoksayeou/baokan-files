Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: The autumn harvest has already begun in most parts of the country. Except for the provinces and regions of northern Anhui, Hebei, Henan, and northern Jiangsu, which have suffered from varying degrees of flooding, and some parts of the Northwest, which are slightly dry, rice, cotton, sorghum, millet, corn, soybeans, and other crops in various parts of the country are generally enjoying a bumper harvest.

　　In vast rural areas of East China, Central South China, and Southwest China, early rice has already been harvested, and mid-season rice is now being harvested intensively. The harvesting of cotton and upland crops has also begun. In North China, Northwest China, and other regions, early autumn coarse grains are being harvested, and cotton picking has begun. In Henan and Shandong, the harvesting of early autumn coarse grains and cotton has entered the autumn busy season. The autumn harvest in Northeast China will also begin soon, and farmers are preparing intensively.

　　The early autumn harvest across the country is generally 80% or more, with an increase of 10% to 30% compared to last year. Early autumn crops in Henan Province have increased by 30%. Northeast China as a whole is estimated to have an 80% good harvest, exceeding a normal bumper harvest year, and increasing by more than 20% compared to last year. Hunan's rice harvest is expected to reach 90% on average across the province. The rice yield in the lake areas of Hunan Province, the Jianghan Plain of Hubei Province, the Poyang Lake area of Jiangxi Province, and parts of southern Jiangsu and northern Jiangsu is extremely good, with a maximum yield of 700 catties per mu.

　　Near Shijiazhuang in North China, each mu of cotton field can yield 150 to 200 catties of seed cotton (three catties can be converted into one catty of ginned cotton), and in some areas, it even reaches 300 to 400 catties. In Chuansha County, southern Jiangsu, the yield is also 120 to 200 catties. According to estimates by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the national cotton production this year may reach about 15 million dan (last year, the national cotton production was 8.5 million dan).

　　The first autumn harvest after the establishment of the Central People's Government not only generally exceeded last year's harvest, but some regions (such as Hunan, Shandong, Jiangxi, etc.) have also experienced harvests that have not been seen in more than a decade. In addition to this year's relatively even rainfall, the fundamental reasons for the bumper harvest are: banditry has been eliminated in most areas, the countryside is stable, and farmers are enthusiastic about production; governments at all levels have implemented policies of rewarding production and "whoever plants, harvests" in the new rural areas, and have vigorously led and supported agricultural production in various places. This year, governments at all levels led farmers to overcome various disasters such as water, drought, and insects, and particularly effectively prevented floods. This year, except for the Huai River, few rivers across the country overflowed. This spring, East China and Central South China led farmers to control rice borers, ensuring a good rice harvest; the Central and local People's Governments issued pesticides and equipment this year, vigorously leading farmers to prevent cotton aphids, which is one of the reasons for the bumper cotton harvest. In addition, governments at all levels called on and organized farmers to cultivate intensively, increase fertilizer application, develop irrigation, improve technology, and help farmers solve the shortage of draft animals and agricultural tools, all of which ensured this year's increased grain and cotton production. For example, the agricultural loans issued by the government in the North China region this year (including loans for farmland water conservancy, livestock, agricultural tools, seeds, and fertilizers) totaled more than 119 million catties of rice. Agricultural loans in Northeast China reached more than 133 billion Northeast currency. These loans have played a significant role in promoting agricultural production this year.

### 人民政府领导农民战胜灾患改进技术  全国大部地区早秋丰收

　　人民政府领导农民战胜灾患改进技术
    全国大部地区早秋丰收
    【新华社十二日讯】秋收已经在全国大部地区开始。除皖北、河北、河南、苏北四个省、区有轻重不等的水灾，西北部分地区稍旱以外，全国各地水稻、棉花和高粱、谷子、玉蜀黍、大豆等作物普庆丰收。
    华东、中南、西南等区广大地区的农村，早稻早已收完，现正紧张收打中稻。棉花和山地作物的收割也已开始。华北、西北等区的早秋杂粮正在开镰，棉花已开始采摘。河南、山东的早秋杂粮和棉花的收摘已进入秋忙。东北秋收也将开始，农民正紧张地进行准备。
    全国各地早秋收成一般都在八成或八成以上，比去年增产一成到三成，河南省早秋作物则增产三成，东北全区估计有八成半年景，超过一般的丰收年成，比去年要增产两成多。湖南水稻全省平均可收九成。湖南省滨湖地区、湖北江汉地区、江西鄱阳湖地区和苏南、苏北部分地区稻产极好，最高每亩收七百斤。
    华北石家庄附近棉田每亩可摘籽花（三斤可折皮棉一斤）一百五十斤到二百斤，个别地区且达三、四百斤。苏南川沙县亦摘一百二十斤到二百斤。据中央人民政府农业部估计，今年全国可产棉一千五百万担左右（去年全国产棉八百五十万担）。
    中央人民政府成立后的第一个秋收，收成不仅一般超过了去年，有些地区（如湖南、山东、江西等）且为十几年来所未有。除今年雨水较为调匀以外，丰收的根本原因是：大部地区匪患消灭，农村安定，农民生产热情高；各级人民政府贯彻执行了奖励生产和对新区农村“谁种谁收”的政策，大力领导和扶持了各地的农业生产。今年各级人民政府领导农民战胜了水、旱、虫等各种灾害，特别是有效地防止了水灾。今年除淮河以外，全国各河很少泛滥。今春华东、中南各地领导农民治螟，保证了水稻的丰收；中央和各级人民政府今年发放治蚜药剂器械，大力领导农民防治棉蚜，则是棉花丰收的原因之一。此外，各级人民政府号召和组织农民精耕细作、增施肥料以及发展灌溉、改进技术、帮助农民解决耕畜、农具短缺困难等，都保证了今年的粮棉增产。如华北区今年政府所发放的农业贷款（包括农田水利、牲畜、农具、种籽、肥料等贷款）共达米一亿一千九百余万斤，东北农贷达东北币一万三千三百余亿元，这些贷款对今年的农业生产，均起了重大的推动作用。
