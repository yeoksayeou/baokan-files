Xinhua News Agency report:

The central topic of the National Import and Export Trade Conference held by the Ministry of Trade in July was how to develop foreign trade, and under this premise, how to adjust the public-private relationship in import and export trade. The public and private sectors participating in the meeting have reached a consensus on these aspects and formulated several specific measures.

The current basic situation of import and export trade is that the state has sufficient foreign exchange and the exchange rate is appropriate; there is no shortage of export goods; and the demand for imported goods is considerable. In order to sell the goods that need to be sold in a timely manner and buy the goods that need to be bought, it is necessary for the public and private sectors to unite and work hard together. After heated discussions, the public and private sectors attending the meeting have reached a basic consensus in their thinking. That is: the basic tasks of import and export trade are to protect and support domestic production, regulate market supply and demand, and stabilize national prices. To complete these major tasks, it is impossible to rely solely on state-owned forces or solely on private forces; it is necessary to first organize private import and export merchants in various forms, and then proceed in a unified manner under the leadership of state-owned trade. This clear conclusion helped correct the erroneous views of some cadres in state-owned trade departments who "only care about the public and not the private" and who regarded taking both public and private interests into consideration as merely "doing it for the sake of taking care of it." It also helped correct the purely profit-seeking views of individual private import and export merchants who did not take into account production and prices, as well as the phenomenon of blind competition in domestic and foreign markets. Based on this basic understanding, the conference mainly discussed four issues and formulated specific principles and methods.

　　　　Formulate Four Principles and Methods
　　　　Public and Private Sectors Unite to Operate Vigorously

(1) The issue of dividing the scope of public and private operations: In addition to handling the import and export of goods under state monopoly purchase and marketing, the state only operates a portion of several major export goods in terms of exports; in terms of imports, in addition to operating industrial equipment and military equipment needed by the state, the operation of civilian equipment is limited to being able to regulate supply and demand and stabilize prices. All other import and export commodities are operated by private individuals. The portion operated by the state can also be entrusted to private merchants for purchase or sales through contracts.

(2) The issue of organizing import and export merchants: In order to overcome the phenomenon of blind competition among private import and export merchants, so as to act in a unified manner, restore and expand international markets, strive for the timely import of important materials; and to facilitate the implementation of the state's foreign trade policies and the division of labor and cooperation between the public and private sectors, the conference decided to adopt three forms: "International Trade Research Association," "Professional Group of Trade Association," and "Joint Operation," to organize import and export merchants according to the different conditions of each region and the voluntary participation of private merchants.

(3) The issue of applying for foreign exchange for imports: All registered importers and private factories may apply for foreign exchange to handle imports, and the Foreign Trade Administration Bureaus in various regions may approve them based on market and production needs. However, raw materials purchased by private factories shall not be resold; importers shall report the sales of imported goods to the trade association on a monthly basis, which will then be forwarded to the Foreign Trade Administration Bureau for the management of imported goods.

(4) The issue of public and private enterprises signing import and export contracts: Once a contract is signed, both the public and private sectors must faithfully implement the contract. Otherwise, except for force majeure reasons, if one party fails to perform the contract and causes losses to the other party, the party shall be liable for compensating the other party for the losses. In the event of a dispute, it can be resolved through consultation, arbitration, or even by filing a lawsuit in court in accordance with the contract.

During the discussion of the above issues, everyone engaged in heated discussions. Representatives of general private import and export firms believed that the current foreign trade tasks are very heavy, and private forces are scattered and weak, making it difficult to undertake such major tasks alone; only close cooperation between the public and private sectors and division of labor through consultation with trade groups can work.

The conference officially opened on July 13 and closed on July 25. The representatives included a wide range of large, medium, and small private import and export merchants from home and abroad, totaling forty-six people, and two university professors. In mid-June, preparatory meetings were held successively in various major cities across the country, and the Central Ministry of Trade sent people to attend, collect opinions, and bring them back for reference. Therefore, before the formal meeting began, both the public and private sectors were "aware of the situation," enabling the conference to achieve more satisfactory results.

　　　　Main Shortcomings in Past Work

At the opening ceremony, Ye Jizhuang, Minister of the Central Ministry of Trade, in addition to explaining how the public and private sectors should divide labor and cooperate based on the Common Program, also reviewed the work of the past nine months, pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of past work and some shortcomings in public-private relations, and focused on self-criticism. These shortcomings are mainly manifested in three aspects: (1) Insufficient coordination of public-private relations: For a period of time, the approval of foreign exchange was tightly controlled; mutual exchange of market information was poor; individual state-owned companies and some private merchants had phenomena of not complying with contract credit; state-owned companies competed with private merchants for foreign relationships; the division of labor was not clear, forming competition in domestic and foreign markets; random reporting of market prices, and not complying with limited price sales, etc. (2) Failure to organize private merchants, resulting in blind competition or manipulation among private merchants, and poor consultation on public-private relations. (3) There were deviations in administrative management and price policy control in some regions; too many changes in the prohibition of import and export or permission of import and export of certain commodities; the internal and external price differences and regional price differences of certain commodities could not take into account the three aspects of production, transportation, and sales; there were also undesirable bureaucratic work styles in some work. Minister Ye then pointed out: In terms of public-private relations, state-owned institutions did not intentionally squeeze out private merchants. According to preliminary statistics for the first half of this year, the proportion of private merchant exports accounted for nearly half of the total export volume, and in the public import and export volume, the proportion entrusted to private merchants accounted for about half, which can illustrate this.

During the conference, Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Deputy Director Bo Yibo delivered speeches and reports, elaborating on the role and future of private industry and commerce, as well as the overall situation of the national economy. The private import and export merchant representatives attending the meeting were very moved, believing that the conference made them "more deeply aware that the government is indeed acting in accordance with the Common Program"; "further understanding the public-private relationship." Some said that this was a "fruitful return."

　　贸易部曾举行全国出进口贸易会议
    讨论开展对外贸易调整公私关系
    一致认为：出进口贸易的基本任务是保护与扶助生产，调剂市场，平稳物价。                                        
    【新华社讯】如何开展对外贸易，并在这一前提下，调整在出进口贸易中的公私关系，是中央人民政府贸易部七月间召开的全国出进口贸易会议的中心议题。参加会议的公私双方在这些方面已取得一致的认识，并拟订了几项具体的办法。
    目前出进口贸易的基本情况是，国家手头的外汇不缺，汇率适当；出口物资不缺乏；进口物资需要相当大。而为了及时地把要销的物品销出去，要买的物品买进来，需要公私团结一致，大力经营。经过了热烈的讨论，出席会议的公私双方在思想上已取得基本一致的认识。这就是：出进口贸易的基本任务是保护与扶助国内生产，调剂市场供求，平稳全国物价。而要完成这一些重大的任务，单靠国营力量或单靠私营力量都是不可能的；必须先把私营出进口商采取各种形式组织起来，然后在国营贸易领导下，步调一致地去进行。这一明确的结论，帮助纠正了国营贸易部门中某些干部的“顾公不顾私”和把公私兼顾仅看作“为照顾而照顾”的错误观点。同样这也帮助纠正了个别私营出进口商人不照顾生产与物价的单纯营利观点，以及在国内外市场上互相盲目竞争的现象。根据这一基本认识，大会主要讨论了四项问题，并订出了具体的原则和办法。
            订出四个原则办法
            公私团结大力经营
    （一）公私经营范围的划分问题：国家除办理统购统销的出入口物品外，在出口方面，只经营几种主要出口物品的一部分；在进口方面，除经营国家所需要的工业器材及军用器材之外，对于民用器材的经营，只以能够调剂供求，稳定物价为限度。其余出入口商品，均归私人经营。国家经营的部分，亦可采用合同方式，委托私商代购或代销。
    （二）出进口商组织起来的问题：为了克服私营出进口商盲目竞争的现象，以便步调一致，恢复及扩张国际市场，争取重要物资的及时进口；并便于贯彻国家的对外贸易政策与公私之间的分工合作，会议决定采用“国际贸易研究会”、“同业公会专业小组”、“联合经营”三种形式，按各地区不同的情况与私商的自愿，把出进口商组织起来。
    （三）进口申请外汇问题：凡已登记之进口商及私营工厂，得申请外汇，办理进口，各地对外贸易管理局得视市场及生产之需要批给。但私营工厂购入的原料，不得转售；进口商则须将进口货品销售情况按月报告公会，汇转对外贸易管理局，以便对进口物品进行管理。
    （四）公私营订立出进口合同问题：合同一经订立，公私双方均须忠实执行合同，否则除不可抗拒之原因外，因一方不履行合同而造成对方损失时，该方应负赔偿对方损失之责任。遇有纠纷时，可按合同进行协商、仲裁，以至向法院控诉解决。
    在讨论上述各问题的过程中，大家展开了热烈的讨论，一般的私营出进口商行代表都认为当前的对外贸易任务是很繁重的，私人的力量是分散和单薄的，很难单独担负这样重大的任务；只有公私密切合作经营，并通过同业小组协商来分工经营才行。
    这次会议于七月十三日正式开幕，至七月二十五日闭幕。代表中相当广泛地包括了国内及部分国外的大、中、小私营进出口商四十六人和大学教授二人。在六月中，全国各大城市都先后分区举行了预备会议，中央贸易部并派人出席，搜集意见携回参考。因此，在正式会议开始前，公私双方都已“心中有数”，使这次会议获得较多完满的结果。
            过去工作中的主要缺点
    在开幕式中，中央贸易部部长叶季壮除根据共同纲领解释公私之间如何分工合作之外，并检讨了过去九个月的工作，指出了过去工作中之优缺点及在公私关系上的某些缺点，并着重进行了自我批评。这些缺点主要表现在三方面：（一）公私关系不够协调：有一个时期，批给外汇抓得很紧；互相交换研究市场情况很差；个别国营公司与某些私商双方都有不遵守合同信用的现象；国营公司争夺私商的国外关系；分工不明确，形成在国内外市场的竞争；乱报行情，不遵守限价出售等。（二）没有把私商组织起来，因而造成私商间盲目竞争或操纵等现象，公私关系协商也不好进行。（三）某些地区行政管理与掌握价格政策上有偏差；对某些商品的禁止进出口或准许进出口变动太多；某些商品的内外差价、地区差价不能把产运销三方面都照顾到；某些工作中还存在着官僚主义的不良作风等。叶部长接着指出：就公私关系而论，决不是国营机构有意把私商排挤掉。根据今年上半年的初步统计，私商出口的比重几占全出口额的半数，而在公营出入口额中，委托私商代办的又占一半左右可以说明。
    在会议进行中，朱总司令和薄一波副主任发表了演讲和报告，对私营工商业的作用、前途，以及国家经济的全盘情况有所阐述，参加会议的私营出进口商代表们都很感动，认为这次会议使他们“更深刻的认识到政府确是依照共同纲领办事的”；“更进一步了解公私关系”。有的说这次是“满载而归”。
