The Mao Zedong Locomotive (Serialized novella)
Twenty-nine, A Good Spirit of Mutual Assistance! A Good Leading Role!…
　　
Originally, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" had also promoted other locomotives in the section to diligently scrub and learn to repair, but the results were not very good. After Guo Shude arrived at the "Mao Zedong Locomotive," it was all set in motion.
　　
Most of the locomotives in the section did not like to scrub, they said:
　　
“We are only responsible for driving, not scrubbing!”
　　
Guo Shude said to the old hero:
　　
“Let’s call on all the workers in our group to scrub for them.”
　　
The old hero thought that in the past they had not been able to motivate others, and it would be good enough to just scrub the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" clean, so he said:
　　
“Let’s ask everyone first.”
　　
When he asked, everyone was willing, because Guo Shude had already mobilized them one by one.
　　
Once, twice scrubbing, at the beginning, the other locomotives ignored this work; after scrubbing more often, they felt embarrassed.
　　
Some said:
　　
“Aren't we all human? The Mao Zedong Locomotive is helping us scrub, but we are not lifting a finger, that's just not right!"
　　
So the other locomotives slowly began to scrub, you help me, I help you...
　　
This made things lively:
　　
Originally, they were not very familiar with each other, but now everyone on each locomotive is familiar.
　　
Whose operating skills are good, whose repair skills are good, the experience of each locomotive is exchanged.
　　
Everyone learns from whoever has any advantages, and if any locomotive has difficulties, the others help, and any problems are solved.
　　
They told each other, envying each other:
　　
“The Mao Zedong Locomotive has a very good relationship with the factory!”
　　
“How good?”
　　
“Let me tell you: the section is promoting a contract repair system, which is not supposed to concern the drivers, but they are the first to respond.”
　　
“How did they respond?”
　　
“For example, when the locomotive is being repaired, they divide everyone into three groups: the upper part group, the lower part group, and the braking group, to help the factory repair the small jobs of each part…”
　　
So on and so forth, as they were talking, Guo Shude came and told everyone about the benefits of contract repair.
　　
People were already moved, and every word he spoke was well-received. When Guo Shude was about to leave, he also said:
　　
“So contract repair is not just the factory's business, we drivers can help them a little when we are idle, repair it a little better, wouldn't that benefit the drivers!”
　　
After speaking, he ran to locomotive 1050. They were cleaning oil cans, and he helped them clean oil cans; they had difficulties repairing the air pump, and he helped them repair the air pump.
　　
After helping 1050, he helped 1051.
　　
Shang Baoheng, Zheng Dugong, and all the crew members were very enthusiastic and excited to work. From extinguishing the fire to igniting the fire, they never left the locomotive for a minute.
　　
As soon as the old hero heard that every locomotive said that the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" was good: good spirit of mutual assistance! Good leading role! Good to help the factory with contract repair! He became even more energetic, and he did all the hard work. He was almost fifty years old, and when he saw everyone struggling to lift the large connecting rod (note), he also helped to lift it, and people couldn't push him away.
　　
Enthusiastic and cheerful work makes people younger.
　　
Note 1: The large connecting rod is the main connecting rod. (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影作
  二十九、互助精神好！带头作用好！……
    原先“毛泽东号”也推动过段上别的机车，要勤于擦洗，要学习检修，可是结果没有很好推动起来。郭树德到“毛泽东号”以后，就搞起来了。
    段上大部分机车都不爱擦洗，他们说：
    “包乘可不包擦！”
    郭树德找老英雄说：
    “咱们号召全组工友替他们擦。”
    老英雄以为过去没有带动起来，只要把“毛泽东号”擦洗干净就很好，不必多事，就说：
    “问问大家再说吧。”
    一问大家都乐意，原来郭树德早已一个个动员好了。
    一次擦，两次擦，开始时别的机车都不理这工作；擦的多了，他们感到不好意思了。
    有的就说：
    “还不都是人，人家毛泽东号帮助咱擦，咱倒不动手，这说不下理去呀！”
    于是别的机车慢慢地就都擦起来，你帮我，我帮你。……
    这一来就热闹了：
    原先互相不太熟，现在各台车上的人都熟悉了。
    谁的操纵技术好，谁的检修技术好，各台车的经验互相交流了。
    谁有什么优点大家都向他学，哪台车有困难其余的车都帮助，什么问题也解决了。
    彼此互相告诉着，羡慕着：
    “人家毛泽东号和工厂的关系搞的也很好！”
    “怎么好？”
    “你听我说啦：段上推行包修制，本来不关包乘的事，可是人家首先响应。”
    “怎么响应？”
    “比方机车检修啦，人家把全体分成三个组：上部组、下部组和制动组，帮助工厂修理各部的小活。……”
    如此这般，说着说着，郭树德来啦，给大家讲包修的好处。
    人们正动心哩，讲的句句都受听。郭树德临走时还说：
    “所以包修不光是工厂的事，咱们包乘的闲着帮助他们一点，修得好一点，还不是开车的受惠呀！”
    说完他又跑到一○五○机车那里去了。那里正扫除油壶，他就帮助他们扫除油壶；修理风泵有困难哩，他又帮助他们修理风泵。
    帮助了一○五○，又帮助一○五一。
    商宝恒、郑笃恭以及全组乘务员都非常热心，非常兴奋地工作着。从落火到点火，一分钟也不离开机车。
    老英雄一听台台机车都说“毛泽东号”好：互助精神好！带头作用好！帮助工厂包修好！就更加精神百倍，什么累活他都干。快五十年纪了，看见大家抬大甩子（注）很费劲，他也帮助去抬，人们推他也推不开。
    热情愉快的工作叫人变得年轻啦。
    注一：大甩子就是主连杆。（附图片）
