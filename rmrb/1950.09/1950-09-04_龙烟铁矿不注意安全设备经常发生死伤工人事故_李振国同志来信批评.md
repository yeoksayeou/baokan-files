　　Longyan Iron Mine Disregards Safety Equipment, Resulting in Frequent Worker Deaths and Injuries. Comrade Li Zhenguo Writes a Letter of Criticism

To the Editorial Comrades:

　　I am currently working at the Pangjiabao Clinic of the Longyan Iron Mine in Xuanhua County, Chahar Province. Although I have only been here for a short time, I have already discovered some problems. I am now only raising two matters, requesting that they be published in the newspaper to draw the attention of the mine's leadership.

　　The Longyan Iron Mine, due to its neglect of safety equipment in the mines, frequently experiences incidents of worker injury. In the past, those injured include Zhao Chunjing, Wang Zhiming, Xia Guisheng, Wang Ji, and others (some died after being injured, and some became disabled). Recently, another oxygen explosion occurred. They used bottles of very poor quality to store oxygen and dispatched more than ten people from Xuanhua County to transport the oxygen bottles to the Yantongshan mine. As a result, due to the unevenness of the road, the oxygen bottles exploded, injuring twelve people and killing seven.

　　The Longyan Iron Mine also neglects the leadership and inspection of medical and health work in the mines, failing to fully guarantee the lives of the workers. On average, as many as three hundred sick workers are reported daily from the various factories and mines. On May 1st, worker Yuan Junling contracted acute gastroenteritis, vomiting and suffering from diarrhea, but the medical staff at Yantongshan Hospital still used "aspirin" and "phenacetin" to make him sweat. Shortly after taking the medicine, he died. Another worker contracted the same disease, and they injected him with one dose each of "Bakunong" and "Diya Jing" in his buttocks; the patient died in a sweat. The general hospital's clinic performed an abdominal tumor removal operation on Liu Fushan, but after the incision, they could not find the tumor. When performing an appendectomy, they could not find the appendix even after two and a half hours and had to sew him up again. Wang Ji was injured in an oxygen explosion, but the doctor did not detect a piece of stone inside his head, mistaking it for tetanus; they injected him with "tetanus antitoxin," resulting in brain damage, and he died after being sent to Beijing.

　　The occurrence of these serious accidents is not accidental. I urge the leaders of the Longyan Iron Mine to conduct an in-depth inspection and resolve these issues promptly to ensure the safety of the workers' lives.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Li Zhenguo

　　龙烟铁矿不注意安全设备经常发生死伤工人事故
    李振国同志来信批评编辑同志：
    我现在察哈尔省宣化县龙烟铁矿庞家堡医务所工作。我到这里虽不久，但已发现了一些问题，现在我只提出两件事，请在报上发表，以引起该矿领导上的注意。
    龙烟铁矿因不注意矿场安全设备，经常有伤人事件发生。过去受伤的有赵春景、王志明、夏桂生、王吉等（伤后有的死亡，有的成了残废）。最近又发生了氧气爆炸事件。他们使用质地很坏的瓶子装氧气，遣派十多人由宣化县城将氧气瓶运往烟筒山矿场，结果因汽车路凸凹不平，氧气瓶爆炸，十二人受伤，七人死亡。
    龙烟铁矿也不注意对矿山医务卫生工作的领导与检查，使工人生命得不到充分保障。各厂矿生病工人每天平均有三百人之多。五月一号，工人袁俊岭感染急性肠胃炎，上吐下泻，但烟筒山医院的医务人员还用“阿士匹林”、“非那西汀”使他发汗；用药不久，人即死去。另一工人也得同样的病，用他们“巴苦脓”和“地亚净”针药各一支注入臀部；病人出大汗而死。总厂医务所给刘福山割腹腔瘤子；但开刀后找不到瘤子在那里。作割除盲肠手术时，竟经过两个半小时，还找不到盲肠在那里，只好又缝上。王吉因氧气爆炸受伤，大夫没有检查出他头部内有一块石片，认为是破伤风；给他注射“破伤风血清”，结果脑受了伤，送到北京就死了。
    这些严重事故的发生，并不是偶然的，请龙烟铁厂领导上深入检查，迅速解决，以保障工人生命的安全。
