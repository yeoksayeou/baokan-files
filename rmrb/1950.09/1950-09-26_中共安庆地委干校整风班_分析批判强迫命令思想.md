CCP Anqing Prefectural Committee Cadre School Rectification Class
Analyzes and Criticizes Commandism

[This newspaper dispatch] In the rectification class of the Cadre School of the Anqing Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Anhui Province, efforts were concentrated on examining and criticizing the commandist work style among district and township cadres. In the preliminary summary of the work of the rectification class, in connection with the inspection of cadre work style, it was found that the commandist work style among district and township cadres was serious and widespread. According to the statistics of the first team of the rectification class, among 133 people, 90% had tied up, scolded, deducted, or beaten people. The leadership summarized these undesirable tendencies, made a mobilization and enlightenment report, and printed it as learning material for everyone's reference. Furthermore, when the students studied these materials, they adopted a method that combined exposing problems and analyzing criticism with improving awareness and establishing correct viewpoints. In this stage, the students' thinking has been improved to some extent, they have recognized the basic spirit of rectification, and have exposed various erroneous ideas. The leadership grasped the basic erroneous arguments of the students, combined them with specific materials, and gave analysis and criticism with an attitude of dealing with the matter and not the person. Most of these students were promoted from activists in the countryside. Their policy thinking was vague, and their organizational discipline was poor. They did not follow the mass line in their work. In addition, influenced by the old society, they regarded commandism as the only way to complete tasks. Their reasons are as follows: First, they believe that in the case of heavy tasks, urgent time, few cadres, and large areas, the task cannot be completed without commandism. They emphasized that the masses are backward, so when asking the masses for things, it is impossible to do without coercion if they only say good things. These cadres fail to see that the consciousness of the broad masses is increasing day by day, and that the task of the cadres is to correctly grasp policies, mobilize the masses, and educate the masses to consciously complete the task. Otherwise, even if things are given to the masses, problems will arise. Didn't commandist errors also occur in rent reduction and anti-hegemony and the distribution of relief grain? Second, some cadres used the excuse of beating bad people instead of good people. For example, if bandits are caught, clues and guns cannot be traced without beating them; or they say that beating these bad people is to support the masses and vent their anger. These comrades lack a legal concept and do not understand that in a country of people's democratic dictatorship, there are certain policies and certain public security and judicial organs to deal with counter-revolutionaries, and the barbaric methods of the reactionary ruling class must never be adopted. Third, when higher-level organs assign tasks, they often do not look at the specific situation, do not talk about working methods, but only limit the time to complete the task, calling on individuals to make plans, launch challenges, competitions, and strive for models. As a result, the idea of showing off and winning trophies has grown among some cadres. Some cadres said: No matter how good the method is, you will still be criticized if you don't complete the task. Conversely, as long as the task is completed, no matter what the method is, you will be praised and rewarded. Therefore, it is necessary to correct the bureaucratic work style and the purely task-oriented view of the leadership in order to completely solve the commandism below. Fourth, some cadres have the narrow-minded revenge mentality of peasants, so they ignore policies and laws and use the methods used by landlords to deal with peasants in the past to deal with landlords and even people they dislike. Fifth, a few cadres have been contaminated with the bad habits of the rulers of the old society, wanting to ride on the heads of the masses to show off their power, and even think that it is shameful for cadres to not be feared by the masses. These cadres have not yet distinguished the fundamental difference between revolutionary workers and the pawns of the ruling class in the old society, let alone policy viewpoints. Sixth, many newly promoted worker-peasant cadres do not understand policies themselves, and are influenced by the beating of people by higher-level cadres, and regard beating and scolding people as commonplace, and do not know that this is illegal. After analyzing these ideological situations, the leadership pointed out that this is the ideological poison of the old society that still dominates everyone's actions, and called on everyone to launch an ideological revolution movement. At this time, everyone began to study Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Party" on the issue of the mass line, and learned how to use state organs (People's Court, Public Security Bureau) to punish counter-revolutionaries. In the process of learning, some comrades also related the mistakes of beating, scolding, and detaining people in the past work, and realized from personal experience the serious consequences of commandism being divorced from the masses. In the discussion, specific examples of cadres with a democratic work style who followed the mass line were cited, so that everyone found the correct way out after criticizing the wrong work style.

　　中共安庆地委干校整风班
    分析批判强迫命令思想
    【本报讯】中共安徽省安庆地委干部学校整风班中，集中力量检查批判了区乡干部中的强迫命令作风。整风班初步总结工作中，联系检查了干部作风，发现区乡干部中强迫命令作风严重而普遍，据整风班第一队统计，一百三十三人中，百分之九十都捆、骂、扣、打过人。领导上把这些不良倾向归纳起来，作了动员启发报告，并印成学习材料，发给大家参考。又学员在学习这些材料时，采取了暴露问题和分析批判，提高觉悟，树立正确观点相结合的办法。在这一阶段中，学员的思想已有所提高，认识了整风的基本精神，暴露了各种错误思想。领导上抓住学员中的基本错误论点，结合具体材料，以对事不对人的态度，给以分析批判。这些学员大部是农村中的积极分子提拔起来的，政策思想模糊，组织性纪律性差，工作中不会走群众路线，加以受旧社会的影响，因而把强迫命令当成完成任务的唯一办法。他们的理由有以下几种：一、认为在任务繁重、时间紧迫，干部少、地方大的情况下，不强迫命令不能完成任务。他们强调群众落后，所以在向群众要东西时，光说好话不强迫是不行的。这些干部看不到广大群众的觉悟正在日益提高，而干部的任务就是正确地掌握政策，发动群众教育群众自觉地完成任务。否则就是给群众东西也是会出问题的，在减租反霸发放救济粮中不是也发生了强迫命令的错误吗？二、有些干部借口说打的是坏人而不是好人。比如捉住土匪，不打就追不出线索和枪枝；或说是打这些坏人是为了给群众撑腰出气。这些同志缺少法治观点，不了解在人民民主专政的国家内，对付反革命分子有着一定的政策和一定的公安司法机构，决不能采取反动统治阶级的野蛮办法。三、上级机关布置任务时，常常不看具体情况，不讲工作方式而只是限定时间完成任务，号召个人订计划，开展挑战竞赛争模范等。因而滋长了部分干部出风头夺锦标的思想。有的干部就说：方式再好，完不成任务仍然得受批评。相反的，只要完成任务，不管方式如何，就会受到表扬奖励。因之必须纠正领导上的官僚主义作风和单纯任务观点，才能彻底解决下面的命令主义。四、有些干部存在着农民的狭隘的报复思想，因而不顾政策，不顾法令，以过去地主对付农民的办法去对付地主以至自己看不惯的人。五、少数干部沾染了旧社会统治者的恶劣作风，想骑在群众头上抖威风，甚至认为当干部而群众不怕是丢人的事。这些干部根本还没有分清革命工作者和旧社会统治阶级爪牙的根本区别，自然说不上政策观点了。六、不少新提拔的工农干部自己不懂政策，受上级干部打人的影响，把打人骂人当成常事，不知道这是犯法。领导上分析了这些思想情况后，指出这是旧社会的思想遗毒还支配大家的行动，号召大家开展思想革命运动。这时大家开始学习刘少奇同志《论党》中的关于群众路线问题，并学习了如何利用国家机关（人民法院、公安局）去惩办反革命分子办法。在学习过程中，有的同志还联系了过去工作中打人骂人扣押人的错误，从亲身经历中体会了强迫命令作风脱离群众的严重恶果，在讨论中并举出了作风民主会走群众路线的干部的具体例子，使大家在批判了错误的作风后，找到了正确的出路。
