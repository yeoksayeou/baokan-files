　　North Korean Newspaper Publishes Secret Documents of Syngman Rhee Revealing:
    Rhee Bandit Plotted to Collude with US and Japan to Attack North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union
    Documents Provide Further Ironclad Evidence of the US and Rhee's Launching of the Korean Civil War
    Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The North Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" published on the 19th a letter from Pan Gu-yong (transliteration), a diplomatic advisor to the Syngman Rhee puppet government, to Syngman Rhee on December 3, 1948, found in the archives of the Syngman Rhee puppet government. This letter exposes how the American imperialists' lackeys in Korea dreamed of colluding with American imperialism, Japanese imperialism, and the Chinese Kuomintang bandit gang to attack Korea, China, and the Soviet Union. TASS Pyongyang, 21st: The letter reads: "Regarding international affairs and the struggle against the communist threat to Korea and China, please allow me to reiterate what I wrote in my previous letter, that East Asia, like other regions in the world facing direct threats, must now make a choice: to allow the communists to conquer without resistance, or to prepare to fight for its existence? Therefore, every loyal patriot in the United States, Korea, Japan, and China must sacrifice himself and contribute his labor. But in order to carry out the coming struggle and achieve a victorious end, the forces of defense—the armies of the United States, Japan, China, and Korea—must coordinate their actions from three directions under the leadership of a supreme commander. These three directions are: the Japanese must advance through Vladivostok along the protruding northeastern area; the Korean and American armies, after liberating our northern territories, must advance through the Liaodong Peninsula to Harbin; and the Chinese Kuomintang army, after recovering, must restore China's lost territories (including Liaodong Province). After the victorious end of the war, the Korean and American armies must occupy Manchuria until all the costs caused by the war of liberation can be compensated by developing the national resources of this region in East Asia with the support of joint capital and manpower from Manchuria, Korea, and the United States; and only when democracy and peace have been fully established there will the American and Korean armies withdraw from Manchuria. In the next stage of transforming the Far East, Japan must obtain ruling power, and Vladivostok and part of Siberia must be transferred to it."
    Pan Gu-yong wrote: "There is no doubt that you have better plans for the future of Asia than I have proposed above, but I want to reiterate my opinion at the end that in case our plan is discovered or captured by the enemy, then I, not you, should be the target of the enemy's attacks and ridicule."
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd: Newspapers in Pyongyang have recently published a secret letter written by Syngman Rhee to his American advisor Robert T. Oliver on September 30, 1949, which was seized by the People's Army. The content of this letter fully exposes the conspiracy of the Syngman Rhee gang to collude with American imperialism and deliberately launch a civil war.
    The letter reads: "...Now, I would like to briefly talk about the situation in South Korea. I feel that now is an excellent time for us to take offensive measures and eliminate the remnants of the bandits in Pyongyang. We should drive the few Kim Il-sung followers into the mountainous areas and let them gradually starve to death there. Then we will push our defense line to the banks of the Tumen and Yalu Rivers." "No matter what foreign countries say, we must do this."
    The letter also stated: "I hope you can understand this situation and convey it to Ambassador Chang Myon and Special Envoy Cho Pyong-ok. We must work together well. You and our two ambassadors and other friends in Washington and New York, and we in Seoul and Tokyo, are all working for one purpose: to get them to agree to our cleaning up and reorganizing internally. We should try to persuade American politicians and the general public so that they will not complain when giving us material assistance and will agree to our plans. The more we delay, the more difficult things will become.
    The good opportunity for the Koreans (referring to the Syngman Rhee gang) to rise up and eliminate them forever is now. I believe that as long as we are allowed to do this, we will be able to resolve it in a very short period of time.
    Please compile these words into a statement, secretly approach influential figures, and get them to support us. If you can get President Truman to listen to these words, then I think there will be good results."
    (Note: Robert T. Oliver was an American professor at the University of Pennsylvania whom Syngman Rhee met during his long stay in the United States. On the one hand, he served as Syngman Rhee's top political advisor; on the other hand, he published reactionary papers in various American publications as a semi-official spokesman for the Syngman Rhee puppet government, promoting the Syngman Rhee puppet government.)

　　朝鲜报纸刊载李承晚秘密文件揭露：
    李匪曾图勾结美日进攻朝中苏
    文件中再度提供美李发动朝鲜内战铁证
    【新华社二十三日讯】朝鲜《劳动新闻》十九日发表了从李承晚傀儡政府档案中所发现的李承晚政府外交参赞潘古庸（译音）在一九四八年十二月三日致李承晚的信件。这封信暴露了美帝国主义在朝鲜的走狗们曾如何梦想勾结美帝国主义、日本帝国主义及中国国民党匪帮，对朝鲜、中国和苏联进攻。据塔斯社平壤二十一日电：该信写道：“关于国际事务和反对共产党威胁朝鲜和中国的斗争，请让我重述一遍前些时候我在去信中写过的话，即东亚像世界上其他面临直接威胁的地区一样，现在必须有所抉择：是不加抵抗地让共产党征服呢，还是准备为了它的存在而斗争呢？因此，美国、朝鲜、日本和中国的每一个忠诚的爱国志士都必须牺牲他自己，贡献出他的劳动。但是为了进行即将来临的斗争，并达到胜利的结束，防卫的力量——美国、日本、中国和朝鲜的军队，必须在最高统帅的领导下，从三方面来配合他们的行动，这三方面就是：日本人必须沿着东北部的突出地带穿过海参崴前进；朝鲜和美国的军队在解放了我们的北部领土后，必须穿过辽东半岛进抵哈尔滨；中国国民党的军队在复元以后必须光复中国失去的领土（其中包括辽东省）。在战争胜利结束以后，朝鲜和美国军队必须占领满洲，一直到解放战争所引起的一切消耗，能够通过在满洲、朝鲜和美国的联合资本与人力的支援下发展东亚这个地区的国民资源的办法取得补偿；而且还要在那里充分建立了民主与和平的时候，美国与朝鲜军才撤出满洲。在改造远东的下一阶段中，日本必须取得统治的势力，将海参崴和西伯利亚的一部分移交给它。”
    潘古庸写道：“毫无疑问，您有比我上面所提出的更为良好的关于将来亚洲命运的计划，可是我要在结束时重述我的意见，万一我们的计划被敌人发现或缴获了，那时候，成为敌人攻击和嘲笑的目标的应该是我，而不是您。”
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】平壤各报顷刊载人民军所缴获的李承晚于一九四九年九月三十日写给他的美国顾问罗伯特·奥里勃的秘密信。这封信的内容充分暴露了李承晚匪帮勾结美帝国主义蓄意发动内战的阴谋。
    信中写道：“……现在，我想把韩国的情形简单地谈一谈。我觉得现在是我们采取攻击措施，消灭平壤残匪的绝好时期。我们要把少数的金日成派驱逐到山岳地带，叫他们在那里逐渐饿死。然后把我们的防御线推到图们江和鸭绿江沿岸。”“不管外国怎样，我们一定要这样作。”
    该信又称：“我希望你能够了解这种情形，并转告张勉大使和赵炳玉特使。我们要好好地协力工作。你和我们的两个大使及其他朋友在华盛顿和纽约，我们在汉城和东京，都为一个目的，即为了叫他们同意我们打扫和整顿内部而工作。应设法说服美国政治家和一般群众，使他们在给予我们物资援助时不发怨言；并同意我们的计划。越拖延、事情就越棘手。
    韩国人（按指李承晚匪帮）奋起永远消灭他们的良好时机就在目前。我相信只要允许我们这样作的话，那么，我们就能够在很短期内予以解决。
    拜托你把这些话很好地编成声明，秘密地接近有势力的人物，使他们支持我们。假若你能够叫杜鲁门总统听进这些话，那么我想会有好结果的。”
    （按：罗伯特·奥里勃为李承晚长期留居美国期间所结识的美国宾夕法尼亚大学教授。他一方面充当李承晚的最高政治顾问；一方面以李承晚傀儡政府半官方发言人的身份，在美国各种刊物上发表反动论文，为李承晚傀儡政府宣传。）
