Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' congratulatory message to the National Combat Heroes Representatives Conference and the National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Models Representatives Conference is as follows:

Comrades, Representatives of National Combat Heroes and National Labor Models!

Today, we warmly celebrate the opening of the National Combat Heroes Representatives Conference and the National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Models Representatives Conference, and pay our highest respects to the National Combat Heroes comrades and the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Models comrades! Today, you are able to hold such a grand meeting in the people's capital – Beijing. This is an unprecedented initiative in Chinese history and has great historical significance.

Under the leadership of the Chinese people's leader, Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country have fought bravely for decades and finally won the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the Chinese People's Liberation War. The feudal system that bound the Chinese people for thousands of years, the imperialist forces that invaded the Chinese nation for more than a century, and the Kuomintang bandit gang that harmed the country and the people for nearly twenty years have all been overthrown by the Chinese people. China has become a truly people's China. The birth of the new China is almost a year old, and its glory will forever shine on the world!

National Combat Heroes, National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Models! You have made brilliant contributions in the Chinese People's Liberation War and in the arduous construction cause of restoring and developing the economy. You are heroes of the people and outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation! We believe that because of the great influence and educational role of your heroic model actions, thousands upon thousands of combat heroes and worker-peasant-soldier labor models will be cultivated. This will inspire and unite all the people to shoulder the arduous tasks of defending and building the motherland.

However, the American warmongers have already ignited the flames of aggressive war in Asia, launching a large-scale armed invasion of Korea and Taiwan. It is deliberately trying to put the chains of slavery around the necks of the Korean people and turn Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam into military bases and colonies of Wall Street. The American imperialists have underestimated the strength of the Asian people's anti-aggression forces and the strength of peace-loving people around the world. This adventurous action will inevitably meet with a shameful defeat. Victory will surely belong to the peace-loving people of the world!

We, the Chinese people, have an iron will and have thousands upon thousands of outstanding sons and daughters like you as our backbone. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will unite as one, have the confidence, and have the determination to fight for the liberation of Taiwan and all the territory of China. We have the confidence and the determination to carry forward the heroic spirit of our combat heroes, to carry forward the new labor attitude and creative wisdom of labor models, to build our beloved motherland into a strong, prosperous, and happy country! We hope that the national combat heroes, the national worker-peasant-soldier labor models, will bring the spirit and experience of this conference back to every commander and fighter of the People's Liberation Army and to the workers and peasants across the country. We must turn many advanced experiences and methods into practical actions of all commanders, fighters, and all the people. We must guard against arrogance and rashness. We must always remember the three roles that Chairman Mao has instructed: First, the leading role. Everyone should, based on their past creative abilities, lead the masses, continue to struggle, and raise their work to a higher standard. Second, the backbone role. Everyone should play a core role among the masses so that the masses have a strong backbone in revolutionary struggle and construction work. Third, the bridge role. It is necessary to enable the leadership and the masses to combine well. The above opinions must be quickly and universally conveyed to the people, and the following opinions must be accurately reflected. Only in this way can we truly serve the people wholeheartedly, be good students of Chairman Mao, and always maintain the glorious title of combat heroes and labor models. Wishing the conference success. We shout:

National combat heroes and labor models unite all the people to follow Chairman Mao forever!

Long live our great motherland – the People's Republic of China!

Long live our most beloved leader of the people, Chairman Mao!

Long live Marshal Stalin, the leader and teacher of the working class and peace-loving people all over the world!

    中华全国总工会致祝词  贺英雄模范两代表会议
    【新华社二十六日讯】中华全国总工会致全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议祝词如下：全国战斗英雄代表和全国劳动模范代表同志们！
    今天我们热烈庆贺全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的开幕，并向全国战斗英雄同志们和工农兵劳动模范同志们致崇高的敬礼！今天您们能够在人民的首都——北京举行这样隆重的大会，这是中国历史上空前的创举，是有着伟大的历史意义的。
    中国工人阶级和全国人民在中国人民领袖毛主席领导下，英勇奋斗了数十年，终于获得了中国人民革命和中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利。几千年来束缚中国人民的封建制度，百余年来侵略中华民族的帝国主义势力和近二十多年来祸国殃民的国民党匪帮的残酷黑暗统治，都被中国人民推翻了。中国成为真正人民的中国了。新中国的诞生已经快一周年了，它的光辉将永远照耀于全世界！
    全国战斗英雄们，全国工农兵劳动模范工作者们！您们在中国人民解放战争中、在为恢复和发展经济的艰巨的建设事业中，是有着辉煌的贡献，您们是人民的功臣，是中华民族优秀的儿女！我们相信：由于您们的英勇模范行动所发生的巨大影响和教育作用，将会培养出成千成万的战斗英雄、工农兵的劳动模范工作者，将会鼓舞并团结全体人民，肩负起保卫祖国和建设祖国的艰巨任务。
    但是，美国战争贩子已经在亚洲燃起了侵略战争的烽火，大举武装侵略朝鲜，侵略台湾。它蓄意要把奴隶的锁链套在朝鲜人民的脖颈上，要把朝鲜、台湾、越南变为华尔街的军事基地和殖民地。美国帝国主义者把亚洲反侵略的人民的力量和全世界爱好和平的人民的力量估计得太低了，它的这种冒险行动将必然遭到可耻的失败，胜利一定属于全世界爱好和平人民的！
    我们中国人民有着钢铁般的意志，有着像您们一样的成千成万优秀儿女作骨干，一定会在毛主席领导下，团结一致，有信心，有决心为解放台湾和中国的全部领土而斗争。我们有信心，有决心，要发扬我们战斗英雄的英勇精神，发扬劳动模范的新的劳动态度和创造的智慧，来把我们亲爱的祖国建设成为一个富强、繁荣、幸福的国家！我们希望全国战斗英雄们，全国工农兵劳动模范同志们，要把这次大会的精神和经验带回给人民解放军的每个指挥员和战斗员，带回给全国的工人和农民群众中去。要把许许多多先进的经验和办法变成为全体指战员和全体人民的实际行动。我们要戒骄戒躁，我们要永远记得毛主席所指示的三个作用：第一就是带头作用。大家应本着自己过去的创造能力，带领群众、继续奋斗，把工作提到更高的标准。第二就是骨干作用。大家应当发挥在群众中的核心作用，使群众在革命斗争与建设工作中，有坚强的骨干。第三就是桥梁作用，要使领导与群众能很好的结合。上面的意见要迅速而普遍地传达到人民中去，下面的意见要很准确的反映上来。只有这样，才是真正全心全意为人民服务，才能做毛主席的好学生，才能永远保持着战斗英雄和劳动模范的光荣称号。预祝大会的成功。我们高呼：
    全国战斗英雄和劳动模范团结全体人民永远跟着毛主席走！
    我们伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国万岁！
    我们最亲爱的全国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    全世界工人阶级和爱好和平人民的领袖和导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
