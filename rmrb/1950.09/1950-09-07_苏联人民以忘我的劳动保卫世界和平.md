　　The Soviet People Defend World Peace with Selfless Labor
    Li He
    On June 19th, in the visitors' gallery of the Kremlin Hall, I heard the resounding voices of the Soviet Supreme Soviet deputies defending world peace. The firm will expressed by the representatives elected by 99.72% of Soviet voters could not but dismay the instigators of a new war. On this day, the Soviet Supreme Soviet passed a resolution supporting the Stockholm Peace Appeal. In the words of Pavlenko, on this day, "every corner of the world knew that the country led by the great Stalin had joined the ranks of defending peace with a formal national resolution."
    For more than four years after the war, the Soviet people have diligently and thriftily devoted themselves to peaceful construction. From 1946 to 1949, 72 million square meters of residential space were repaired and built in cities, and 2.3 million houses were repaired and built in the countryside. With selfless labor, workers started more than 5,000 industrial enterprises, and production not only exceeded pre-war levels, but also exceeded the level set for 1950 in the post-war Five-Year Plan. With selfless labor, farmers increased grain production beyond pre-war levels, merged thousands of small collective farms into large collective farms, and strived for larger-scale harvests. 37.9 million primary and secondary school students and 1,194,400 students and correspondence students in higher education institutions are learning to serve mankind. Scientists have just achieved new victories in the study of linguistics and physiology... While the Soviet people are working hard on peaceful and constructive labor with confidence, they are constantly guarding against the conspiracies of war instigators. When the Soviet people saw imperialism fanning the flames of a new war, they angrily raised the banner of defending peace and solemnly threw themselves into the struggle to defend peace.
    On June 25th, American imperialism launched an invasion of Korea. The Soviet people launched a movement to oppose aggression and support the Korean people with unparalleled and surging anger. From June 30th to August 1st, the Soviet people signed the Peace Appeal nationwide, and working people everywhere signed it through large-scale collective actions. Within five days, the number of signatures reached 57 million. Within ten days, the number of signatures surged to more than 96 million. Within thirty-two days, the signature campaign concluded victoriously with a brilliant achievement of 115,275,940 people. All adult Soviet citizens signed the Peace Appeal. The unified will of more than 115 million Soviet citizens to defend peace is an overwhelming force! Combined with peace advocates all over the world, it will crush the head of any poisonous snake instigating war!
    During the days of the peace signature campaign, rallies to defend world peace and support the Korean people were held everywhere in factories, mines, farms, schools, government offices, and residences throughout the Soviet Union. In Moscow and the Moscow region alone, 15,000 such mass rallies and meetings were held in one month, with nearly four million participants, and more than 100,000 people spoke at the meetings. During these days, a propaganda poster of an old mother holding the Peace Appeal was posted everywhere on the streets of Moscow. Her eyes shot out rays of anger, and her face showed fearless courage and will. No, this is not just a painting. Please read the letter written to the Soviet Peace Committee by Daria Nemova, a 70-year-old mother of seven who received the title of "Mother Heroine": "... I sent three of my children to defend my motherland, and I endured the pain for them, for my sacred motherland... If not a madman, who wants war now? I, a Soviet mother, am against war... I signed my name on the Peace Appeal. Along with my signature are the signatures of my children and grandchildren, who also hope for peace in the world. But, if it is necessary to take up arms again to defend the cause of truth, then I, a Soviet mother, will not send three people, but will take my whole family of patriots to defend peace." These are the words from the heart of Daria Nemova, who signed with her eighteen children and grandchildren, and these are the words from the heart of the Soviet people. This kind of love for the motherland, love for future generations, hatred for war instigators, and sense of responsibility for the cause of defending peace have been boiling in the hearts of the people of the sixteen Soviet republics these days.
    Extensive signatures, and intensified production during and after the signature period—these are the two major characteristics of the Soviet people's movement to defend world peace since the end of June. "Organize Stakhanovite work teams for the cause of peace!" Under this slogan, the Soviet working people entered what can be described as an unprecedented labor upsurge since the war. In Moscow, tens of thousands of workers participated in peace work teams. In Leningrad, metal cutters doubled their output during the peace work team period. In the South Urals, hundreds of production teams and thousands of Stakhanov workers from Magnitogorsk steelworkers participated in peace work teams. Donets miner Dukhanin said: "We won peace in a brutal struggle, and now we are consolidating peace with Stakhanovite labor!" Worker Goncharov, who overfulfilled the production of hundreds of tons of steel in July, said: "Our metal is peaceful metal." Peace and constructive labor are so inseparable. Soviet collective farmers, who worked selflessly to complete the grain harvest ahead of schedule, wrote on the endless stream of vehicles delivering grain to the state: "This is our contribution to the cause of peace."
    On August 4th, 1,038 workers at the Moscow "Dynamo" factory completed one and a half to two times their production tasks. In July, the workers at this factory put forward many rationalization proposals, saving the country 2.3 million rubles. He Leijin, a young press worker in this factory, had already produced one and a half times his quota when he stopped work at noon on August 4th. During his break, he ran to the editorial department of the factory newspaper and wrote a poem expressing the emotions of all the workers in the factory:
    There will be no war!
    Everywhere there is a roar:
    "Strive for peace, move forward!"
    If the people say "No!"
    Then it is no.
    Tikhonov said: "When we are working and turning the wilderness into a thriving garden, it is not to see the thriving garden turn back into a wilderness." Having recently rescued mankind from the abyss of suffering and restored the gardens of the motherland, the Soviet people have strengthened the confidence of peace-loving people all over the world with their great actions, and pointed to a bright future with their glorious Stalinist banner.

### 苏联人民以忘我的劳动保卫世界和平

　　苏联人民以忘我的劳动保卫世界和平
    李何 
    六月十九日，记者在克里姆林宫大厅的旁听席上，听到了苏联最高苏维埃代表们保卫世界和平的响亮的声音。由百分之九十九点七二的苏联选民选举出来的代表们所表示的坚决意志，不能不使新战争的挑拨者们惊慌失色。在这一天，苏联最高苏维埃通过了拥护斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的决定。用巴甫连科的话来说，这一天，“全世界各个角落都知道了伟大斯大林领导的国家，以正式的国家决议，加入保卫和平事业的阵营中来。”
    苏联人民在战后四个多年头中，克勤克俭地致力于和平建设。从一九四六年到一九四九年，在城市中修复建造了七千二百万平方公尺的居住面积，在乡村里修复建造了二百三十万栋住房。工人们以忘我的劳动，使五千多处工业企业动工，使生产不但超过了战前水平，而且超过了战后五年计划为一九五零年规定的水平。农民们以忘我的劳动使谷物产量超过了战前水平，又把成千的小集体农场合并成大集体农场，争取更大规模的丰收。三千七百九十万中小学生和一百十九万四千四百高等教育机关的学生和函授学生，正在学习着为人类服务，科学家刚刚在语言学和生理学的研究中获得了新的胜利……当苏联人民满怀信心地努力从事和平的建设性劳动的时候，他们无时不在提防着战争挑拨者的阴谋。当苏联人民看到帝国主义在煽动新战争的烽火时，他们愤怒地举起了保卫和平的大旗，庄严地投入了保卫和平的斗争。
    六月二十五日，美帝国主义发动了对朝鲜的侵略。苏联人民以无比高涨的愤怒展开了反对侵略与支援朝鲜人民的运动。从六月三十日到八月一日，苏联人民举国一致地为和平宣言签名，劳动人民到处以大规模的集体行动进行了签名。五天之内签名人数达到五千七百万。十天之内，签名人数激增到九千六百余万人。三十二天之内，签名运动以一亿一千五百二十七万五千九百四十人的辉煌成就胜利结束。全体成年的苏联公民都在和平宣言上签了名。一亿一千五百多万苏联公民所表示的保卫和平的统一意志，这是排山倒海的力量！它和全世界的和平拥护者结合在一起，将要踏碎任何煽动战争的毒蛇的头！
    在和平签名运动的日子里，全苏各地的工厂、矿山、农场、学校、机关、住宅，到处都举行了保卫世界和平和声援朝鲜人民的集会。单是莫斯科市和莫斯科州，一个月当中就举行了一万五千次这样的群众大会和集会，参加的近四百万人，有十万多人在会上发了言。在这些日子里，莫斯科的街头到处贴着一个老母亲拿着和平宣言的宣传画，她的眼睛里射出愤怒的光芒，她的脸上表现着无畏的勇敢和意志。不，这不是画。请读读一位有七个儿女、得过“光荣母亲”称号的七十岁老母亲达里雅·涅莫娃写给苏联拥护和平委员会的信吧：“……我送了自己的三个孩子去保卫自己的祖国，我为他们，为我神圣的祖国而忍痛……要不是疯子，谁现在要战争？我，苏维埃的母亲，反对战争……我在保卫和平宣言上签了自己的名字。跟我的签名一起，有我的孩子们、孙子们的签名，他们同样希望全世界的和平。可是，假使要重新拿起武器来保卫真理的事业的话，那时候，我，苏维埃的母亲，将不是送出三个人，而是拿自己爱国者的全家去保卫和平。”这是带着儿孙十八个人一起签名的达里雅·涅莫娃心坎里的话，这是苏联人民心坎里的话。这种对祖国的爱，对后代的爱，对战争挑拨者的恨，对保卫和平事业的责任感，这些日子来加倍沸腾在苏联十六个加盟共和国的人民的心头。
    广泛的签名，在签名期间和签名以后的加紧生产，——这就是六月底以来苏联人民保卫世界和平运动的两大特色。“为和平事业组织斯塔哈诺夫式的工作班！”在这一口号下，苏联的劳动人民进入了在战后可以说是空前的劳动高潮。在莫斯科，数以万计的工人参加了和平工作班。在列宁格勒，金属切割工人在和平工作班期间把产量提高了一倍。在南乌拉尔，马克尼托哥尔斯克的钢铁工人有几百个生产队，几千个斯塔哈诺夫工人参加了和平工作班。顿尼兹的矿工杜汉宁说：“我们曾在残酷的斗争中赢得了和平，现在我们以斯塔哈诺夫式的劳动来巩固和平！”七月份超计划生产了数百吨钢的工人冈察罗夫说：“我们的金属是和平的金属”。和平和建设性的劳动是这样的不可分。以忘我的劳动争取提前完成了谷物收获的苏联集体农民，在川流不息的给国家缴纳谷物的车辆上，写上了“这是我们对和平事业的贡献。”
    莫斯科“狄纳莫”工厂的一千零三十八个工人在八月四日完成了生产任务的一倍半到二倍，这个工厂的工人在七月份提出了许多合理化建议，为国家节省了二百三十万卢布。这工厂里一个年轻的压榨机工人赫雷金在八月四日中午歇工的时候，已经生产了定额的一倍半。他趁休息的机会，跑到工厂报纸的编辑部里，把全厂工人的情感写成一首诗：
    不会有战争！
    到处是吼声：
    “争取和平，前进！”
    要是人民说了“不能！”
    那就是不能。
    吉洪诺夫说过：“当我们工作着，把荒野变成繁荣的花园的时候，并不是为了要看繁荣的花园再变为荒野。”不久以前把人类从苦难深渊中拯救出来，把祖国的花园修复起来的苏联人民，以他们伟大的行动加强了全世界和平人民的信心，以他们光辉的斯大林的旗帜指向着美好的未来。
