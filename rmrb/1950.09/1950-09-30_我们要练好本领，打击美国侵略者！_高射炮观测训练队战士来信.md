　　"We must practice our skills to strike the American invaders!"
    Letter from soldiers of the anti-aircraft artillery observation training team

    To the Editor:

　　The anti-aircraft artillery ×× regiment observation training team stationed in Jiugong Village, Nanyuan, held a discussion on the Mid-Autumn Festival night. After hearing the news that American imperialist B-29 bombers had once again invaded our country's territory, Andong City, and dropped bombs injuring our compatriots, the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense. Every soldier expressed infinite anger at the American invaders. Soldier Zhang Baosuo stood up and said, "In the future, I will further improve my skills in order to strike at the American imperialists' acts of aggression." Directional wheel operator Liu Yuankai said, "I am determined to study hard and practice my skills. If American planes dare to invade, I will definitely make sure they don't fly back!" Altimeter chief Wu Jiliang said indignantly, "American planes have repeatedly invaded our country's airspace, strafed and bombed our people. This is an act of imperialist aggression. We tell the American imperialist aggressors: you have incurred a blood debt to the Chinese people, and this blood debt must be repaid with blood!" Finally, all the officers and soldiers expressed their attitudes indignantly. On the great festival of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are determined to maintain a tense combat posture to defend the safety of the motherland's airspace as a congratulation and gift to the National Day commemoration!

　　“我们要练好本领，打击美国侵略者！”
    高射炮观测训练队战士来信编者同志：
    驻南苑旧宫村的高射炮××团观测训练队，在中秋夜举行了座谈。当听到美帝Ｂ２９轰炸机再次侵犯我国领土安东市并投弹炸伤我同胞的消息以后。会场上的空气显得极为紧张。每个战士对美国侵略者都表示了无限的愤怒。战士张宝锁站起来说：“以后我更要进一步的提高自己的技术，以便打击美帝的侵略行动。”方向盘测手刘元凯说：“我要决心苦学、练好本领，假如美机胆敢侵犯，就一定叫它飞不回去！”测高机长武纪良激愤的说：“美机屡次侵犯我国领空，扫射轰炸我国人民，这是帝国主义的侵略行为。我们告诉美帝侵略者：你们已欠下中国人民一笔血债，这笔血债必须要用血来偿还！”最后全体指战员均激愤的表示了态度，在中华人民共和国成立一周年的伟大节日，我们决以紧张的战斗姿态，保卫祖国领空的安全，作为对国庆纪念的祝贺与献礼！
