　　【Qiqihar Dispatch】 (By our correspondent Liang Tian) On the evening of September 11th, the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation entered Heilongjiang Province from Inner Mongolia. The boundless grasslands and towering peaks were bathed in the red glow of the setting sun, and herds of cattle and horses galloped across the grasslands. Our young international friends gazed out the window, fully enjoying the beautiful Chinese landscape and the land that is undergoing peaceful construction. The people of all ethnic groups in Boketu welcomed them with red flags, and more than two thousand young people from Zalan Village enthusiastically gathered with them. Vu Hoang Minh, the representative of Vietnam, led everyone in singing "The East is Red," a song most loved by the Chinese people.
    The train's stop in Ang'angxi was very short, but the atmosphere of friendship and unity was incredibly strong.
    At 9:30 PM, the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation arrived in Qiqihar City. The people of Heilongjiang Province and Qiqihar City solemnly and warmly welcomed our young comrades-in-arms at the station. At the welcoming meeting, after Li Jianbai, the secretary of the Provincial Communist Youth League, and Wang Jinru, the mayor of the city, delivered speeches expressing their sincere welcome, Harmut, the representative of the Free German Youth League, paid tribute to the Chinese youth on behalf of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the German youth. Thara, the representative of the Democratic Youth of Burma, paid tribute to Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, and the Chinese youth, and emphasized the need to learn from the victorious struggle experience of the Chinese youth. He said that the Burmese youth guarantee to fight bravely in the common struggle to defeat the imperialist warmongers. The speeches of the youth representatives from various countries were met with enthusiastic applause and cheers.
    In the evening, Qiqihar City held a reception. The Vice Chairman of Heilongjiang Province paid tribute to the outstanding young fighters from all over the world on behalf of the 5.7 million people of the province, and introduced the difficult times of the Heilongjiang people five years ago, the glorious struggle of the Heilongjiang people, and their joy today. He said: "We have restored agricultural production, and industry and commerce are moving towards prosperity. Ninety percent of school-age children are enrolled in school. We will soon build a modern paper mill with 1,000 workers and a farm tool factory with 600 workers this year. Our future in production and construction is broad and bright. We Chinese people desire peaceful construction, but we are determined and have the strength to smash any provocations by warmongers."
    At the party, the labor models and combat heroes of Heilongjiang Province met and talked cordially with the representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation. The World Federation of Democratic Youth representatives surrounded Liang Jun, the nationally renowned female tractor driver, Xing Zhaokai, the industrial labor model representative from Qiqihar who was selected to attend the National Labor Model Conference, Guo Yulan, the female labor model of Heilongjiang Province, Sun Wenzhong, the combat hero, and Wang Fengming, the special-class labor hero and driver of Locomotive No. 631, who has safely traveled over 200,000 kilometers. They asked these young Chinese labor models and heroes a series of questions, one after another, wishing they could fully learn about their heroic deeds in that short half-hour.
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Cultural Troupe also arranged moving performances for the delegation. The Northeast folk song medley was a favorite of the representatives. This song is an epic of the Northeast people's journey from sorrow to hatred, to struggle, and from struggle to victory. The young comrades-in-arms of the delegation were deeply moved by the song. Like the Chinese people, they understood the past hardships and fighting power of our people.

　　世界青联代表团和黑龙江青年联欢
    【本报齐齐哈尔电】本报记者梁田报道：九月十一日黄昏，世界青联代表团由我国内蒙进入黑龙江省。一望无际的草原和高耸的山峰正沐浴着落日红光，成群的牛马奔驰在草原之上。我们的青年国际友人凭窗眺望，尽情地欣赏这美丽的中国河山，和正在进行和平建设的大地。博克图的各族人民高举着红旗迎接了他们，扎兰村二千多青年和他们热情地联欢。越南代表武黄明领着大伙高唱中国人民最喜爱的歌曲《东方红》。
    列车在昂昂溪逗留的时间很短，但是，友爱和团结的气氛真是无比的浓厚。
    下午九点三十分，世青代表团抵达齐齐哈尔市。黑龙江省和齐市人民隆重地、热烈地在车站欢迎我们的青年战友。欢迎会上，在省团委书记李剑白和市长王劲如致词表示热诚的欢迎后，自由德国青年联盟代表哈尔默特代表世界青联和德国青年向中国青年致敬；缅甸民主青年代表塔拉，向中国人民的领袖毛泽东和中国青年致敬，并强调要学习中国青年获得胜利的斗争经验。他说，缅甸青年保证在击败帝国主义战争贩子的共同斗争中勇敢地战斗。各国青年代表们的演说受到狂热的鼓掌与欢呼。
    晚间，齐齐哈尔市举行了招待晚会。黑龙江省副主席，代表全省五百七十万人民向世界各国杰出的青年战士们致敬，并介绍了黑省人民五年前的困苦时光，黑省人民的光辉的斗争经过和他们今日的喜悦。他说：“我们恢复了农业生产，工商业正走向繁荣；百分之九十的学龄儿童都入了学；我们今年即将兴建一个一千工人的现代化纸厂、一个六百工人的农具工厂。我们生产建设前途是广阔而光明的。我们中国人民愿望和平建设，但我们有决心和力量粉碎任何战争贩子的挑衅。”
    晚会上，黑龙江省的劳动模范、战斗英雄和世界青联代表团的代表们亲切地见面会谈。世界青联代表们围住全国闻名的女拖拉机手梁军、被选为出席全国劳模会议的齐市工业劳模代表邢兆开、黑省妇女劳动模范郭玉兰、战斗英雄孙文忠和突破二十万公里安全行走的六三一号机车司机长特等劳动英雄王凤鸣等。他们向这些中国的青年劳模和英雄们提出一连串的问题，一个又一个、恨不得在那短短的半小时内，完全知道他们的英勇的事迹。
    黑省文工团也为代表团安排了动人的节目。东北民歌连奏、是代表们最喜爱的一个。这个歌，是东北人民一部从悲哀走向愤恨、走向战斗，从战斗走向胜利的史诗。代表团的各国青年战友们深深为歌声所感动，他们和我们中国人民一样，懂得我国人民过去的辛酸和战斗的力量。
