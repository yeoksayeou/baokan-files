　　MacArthur is the Organizer of Bloody Crimes
    Lasa Jin, Feilipofu, Collaboration
    General MacArthur's name has been frequently appearing in the pages of the Hearst newspapers recently. "The New Yorker and American" magazine calls him a "contemporary figure" and a "hero of today"...
    MacArthur's reputation in America today is by no means accidental. In the Wall Street's predatory adventures in Asia, the leading role belongs to colonizers wearing general's epaulettes, like MacArthur.
    MacArthur's entire career proves that he is "wholeheartedly loyal" to American monopoly capitalists; he is prepared to do the darkest deeds to earn dollars. In the summer of 1932, thousands of hungry, unemployed veterans marched to Washington to claim a bonus that had been promised to them. In Anacostia (a district of Washington), they built simple mud and wood houses and shacks, housing their starving families there. The desperate unemployed demanded work and bread, but were answered with bullets.
    It was MacArthur who commanded the infantry, cavalry, and tanks to attack the defenseless group and savagely strafe the demonstrating unemployed. Some were killed and 55 were injured. Thus, that day was known as "Bloody Thursday" in America. That night, MacArthur attacked the refugee camp in Anacostia again. Soldiers, on his orders, burned down the unemployed's shacks, drove out women and children, and poisoned them with gas bombs.
    After shooting the demonstrators, General MacArthur told reporters without emotion, "'This is a good job'..." "This group gave a disgusting impression. It had the signs of revolution." From these words, it can be seen that MacArthur is a stubborn counter-revolutionary, a hater of the people, and a cold-blooded executioner who slaughtered workers.
    "Bloody Thursday" in Washington was not MacArthur's only crime. He was active in various Asian countries as an American constable for a long time. Wall Street attempted to use cannons and swords to force millions of people in Asia to submit to its will and become its slaves.
    MacArthur is a hereditary colonizer in the Philippines. His father, Arthur MacArthur, was the governor-general of the Philippines after the American occupation. His brutal suppression of patriots who stood up to fight against American rulers aroused widespread resentment among the Filipino people. He sentenced 79 Filipino guerrillas and patriots to death by hanging. He burned and razed some villages and cities. Filipino guerrillas who resisted the American occupiers were subjected to barbaric and inhuman torture. At that time, Douglas MacArthur was still a lieutenant, but his bestiality was no less than that of his father. Even now, he boasts that he fired six shots at a guerrilla armed only with a knife...
    MacArthur became a "marshal" of the Philippines and continued to suppress and strangle. When the Japanese landed in the Philippines, this "marshal" abandoned his troops in Bataan and fled to Australia. After World War II, he came to the Philippines again and launched a savage offensive against the guerrillas who had bravely resisted the Japanese occupiers and demanded freedom and independence for their country.
    According to the Philippine treaty, the United States has military bases there for a 99-year lease. American capital controls the economic lifeline in all economic sectors. MacArthur owns a brewery in the Philippines worth between seven and ten million US dollars, and he is also a shareholder of the Philippine gold mining company. Therefore, it is no accident that Freda Kirchwey wrote in *The Nation* magazine that "the Philippines is MacArthur's private domain."
    Later, MacArthur was stationed in occupied Japan. American monopoly capital has even greater interests in Japan. They devoured Japanese industry. American generals are building naval and air bases in Japan, turning Japan into a military and strategic base for new aggression against Asia. MacArthur established his own dictatorial system in Japan. Under this system, war criminals were released from prison and became MacArthur's assistants, but democratic activists were deprived of political freedom; the organizers of cruel bacteriological warfare also found refuge under MacArthur's protection. Fascist order is being restored, and the terror against the democratic movement, especially against the working class and its organizations, is becoming increasingly rampant.
    However, MacArthur's deeds in Asia are not all smooth sailing. The national liberation movement of the peoples of the East terrifies American colonizers. The existence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea makes the vicious colonizers and their masters uneasy. American imperialists are trying to compensate for their failure in China with new plunder in Asia. As a result, MacArthur's telegrams and memos are constantly sent to Washington, demanding the immediate establishment of a "defense line" from the Philippines through Taiwan to Korea. Under the pretext of "defense," they are planning to plunder foreign lands and enslave other nations.
    Needless to say, MacArthur's plan reflects the intentions of American monopoly capital. MacArthur has a strong backing on Wall Street. It is well known that he owes his official position and millions of fortunes to his father-in-law Stotesbury, one of the main partners of the banker Morgan. Taft, Nolan, Bridges, and other congressmen acting as agents of the capitalists, fully support MacArthur and his "policy of violence against Asia" in Congress. These congressmen demand unlimited power for MacArthur and demand "decisive action" in Asia to ensure the investment of monopoly capital.
    American banks—Morgan Bank, Citibank, and others—snatched the gold mines of South Korea from Japanese monopoly capitalists. They coveted the oil fields of Korea. They need Korea to be an important military and strategic base in the Far East.
    So Dulles, the special envoy of Wall Street and a war-monger, hurried from Washington to Tokyo.
    The heads of the US Army General Staff flew to Tokyo. An American journalist commented meaningfully on this trip on July 18, writing that at MacArthur's headquarters, Washington's senior guests experienced "not only the headquarters' views on the military situation in Japan, but also the strategic situation in the vast area of Asia." The reporter added: "The problems of Korea and Taiwan will probably also be discussed..."
    The Tokyo meeting soon produced results. Korea was chosen as the main target of American aggression, and MacArthur was appointed as its organizer. MacArthur promised to end "all battles in Korea" within a week.
    However, as is well known, MacArthur's estimates were very wrong. American equipment and long-term Americanized troops are of no use. The Syngman Rhee bandit army fled under the blows of the People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    MacArthur was furious. In order to reorganize the collapsing Syngman Rhee bandit army, he personally flew to South Korea. But the general's roar could not change the situation that the Syngman Rhee bandit army continued to flee south.
    The adventure in Korea cannot be carried out by others, MacArthur and his masters understood this. They had to send American troops, air force, and fleet to Korea, and take blatant military aggression against the Korean people. The leader of the American aggressor army, of course, is still that MacArthur.
    The patriots of Korea have been carrying out a heroic struggle against the American aggressor army for two months. In fierce battles, they are driving the foreign invaders step by step from their own country. The fully armed American invaders have shown their inability to resist in open battles against the heroic Korean People's Army.
    The earth is burning under the feet of the invaders. The heroic Korean guerrillas make the invaders uneasy day and night. General MacArthur has become even more violent. He savagely bombs peaceful cities and villages, killing thousands of women, children, and old people, retaliating against the Korean people in this way.
    MacArthur hates the Korean people. He despises Koreans as an "inferior, colored race." He follows Truman in calling Koreans "robbers." An American journalist reported: "An American soldier in the rear becomes suspicious when he meets a Korean and starts shooting at him." The reporter shamelessly added: "Some other American soldiers shoot at Koreans first and then ask questions"...
    The American aggressors "suspect" that villages are hiding guerrillas and set many villages on fire. For captured guerrillas, they break their spines before shooting them.
    American imperialists are trying to turn Korea into their own colony and turn the Korean people into obedient slaves of Wall Street. However, the proud, freedom-loving Korean people will never submit to the dollar and the MacArthur executioner. They will fight to complete victory for the freedom and independence of their country.

### 麦克阿瑟是血腥罪行的组织者

　　麦克阿瑟是血腥罪行的组织者
    拉萨金  非里泡夫  合作
    麦克阿瑟将军的名字最近在赫斯特系报纸的版面上是经常出现的。“纽约客与美国人”杂志称他是“当代人物”和“今日英雄”……
    麦克阿瑟在今天的美国获得了这样的名声绝不是偶然的。在华尔街在亚洲所进行的强盗式冒险中，头等角色就属于佩有将军肩章的殖民者，如麦克阿瑟之流。
    麦克阿瑟自己的全部生涯证明着：他“全心全意地效忠”于美国独占资本家；他是准备干最黑暗的勾当来争取美元的。一九三二年夏季，数千饥饿的失业军人结队来到华盛顿，请领那一项曾经答应给他们的补助金。在阿那柯斯底亚（华盛顿的一个区）他们用泥土和木板搭成简陋的土屋和茅舍，把自己挨饥的家庭安置在那里。陷于绝望中的失业者们要求工作和面包，而回答他们的却是枪弹。
    正是麦克阿瑟指挥了步兵、骑兵、坦克进攻了没有防御的一群，并野蛮地扫射示威的失业者。一些人被残杀了，五十五个人受了伤。因此，这一天因而有美国“血腥星期四”的称号。当天夜间，麦克阿瑟又袭击了阿那柯斯底亚的难民窝，兵士们按照他的命令烧毁了失业者的棚屋，把妇女和儿童赶出来，用瓦斯弹来毒害他们。
    在射击示威者以后，麦克阿瑟将军对新闻记者毫无感情地说：“‘这是一件很好的工作’……”。“这一群人产生了一种令人可厌的印象。它有着革命的征兆”，从这几句话中，可以看出麦克阿瑟是顽固的反革命者，人民的憎恨者，屠杀工人的冷血刽子手。
    华盛顿的“血腥星期四”不是麦克阿瑟仅有的罪恶。他以美国宪兵的角色长期活跃于亚洲各国，华尔街企图用炮火和刀剑使亚洲数百万人民俯首听命，做它的奴隶。
    麦克阿瑟是菲律宾世袭的殖民者。他的父亲——阿尔杜尔·麦克阿瑟，是美国人强占菲律宾后的菲律宾总督，他对那些为反对美国统治者而挺身斗争的爱国志士的残酷镇压，引起了菲律宾人民对他的普遍愤恨。他把菲律宾游击队，爱国志士七十九人判处了绞刑。他焚毁了并铲平了一些乡村和城市。反抗美国占领者的菲律宾游击队员受到过野蛮的、非人性的酷刑。当时，杜格拉斯·麦克阿瑟还是少尉，但其兽性并不逊于他的父亲。直到如今，他还夸示着，他对一个仅用刀子武装的游击队员打了六枪……
    麦克阿瑟做了菲律宾的“元帅”，继续进行镇压和绞杀。当日本人登陆菲律宾时，这位“元帅”把自己的军队抛弃在八打雁，自己逃到了澳大利亚。第二次世界大战后，他又来到菲律宾，并对那些英勇地抗击过日本占领者并要求祖国的自由与独立的游击队开始野蛮的进攻。
    根据所缔结的菲律宾条约，美国在那里有着九十九年租借期间的军事基地。美国资本把一切经济部门中的经济命脉都控制在自己的手中。麦克阿瑟在菲律宾拥有价值在七百万美元至一千万美元之间的啤酒制造厂，他又是菲律宾金矿公司的股东。因此费莱达·克尔楚伊在《民族》杂志上所写的“菲律宾是麦克阿瑟的私人领地”并不是出于偶然的。
    后来，麦克阿瑟坐镇美军所占领的日本。美国的独占资本在日本有着更大的利益。他们吞噬了日本工业。美国的将军们在日本建筑着海空基地，把日本变成侵略亚洲新行动的军事、战略的基地。麦克阿瑟在日本建立了自己独裁的制度，在这制度下战犯从狱中获释，并变成麦克阿瑟的助手，可是民主活动分子却被剥夺了政治自由；准备残酷的细菌战争的组织者们，在麦克阿瑟的庇护下也找到了避难所。法西斯的秩序正在恢复，反对民主运动，首先是反对工人阶级及其组织的那种恐怖活动愈来愈猖獗了。
    但是，麦克阿瑟在亚洲的勾当并不是万事亨通的。东方各族人民的民族解放运动使美国殖民者恐怖起来。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的存在使凶恨的殖民者和他的主人感到不安。美国帝国主义者们企图以亚洲的新掠夺来补偿自己在中国的失败。于是麦克阿瑟的电报和备忘录不断地拍发到华盛顿，要求立即建立从菲律宾经台湾至朝鲜的“防御线”。就在“防御”的借口下计划着掠夺外国土地，并奴役其他民族。
    不用说，麦克阿瑟的计划反映着美国独占资本的意向。麦克阿瑟在华尔街有强有力的后台。众所周知，由于他自己的官职和百万财富，他感激着自己的岳父斯托茨别里——银行家摩根的主要伙伴之一。塔虎脱，诺兰，布里治及其他作着资本家代理人的议员们，在国会中完全支持着麦克阿瑟和他的“对亚洲的暴力政策”，这些议员为麦克阿瑟要求毫无限制的权力，要求在亚洲进行“决定性的行动”，以保证独占资本的投资。
    美国的银行——摩根银行、花旗银行及其他银行，把南朝鲜的金矿从日本独占资本家手中夺过来。他们垂涎着朝鲜的石油田。他们需要朝鲜成为远东的一个重要军事战略基地。
    于是华尔街的特使，战争贩子杜勒斯从华盛顿匆忙跑到东京去。
    美国陆军参谋部的首脑们飞到东京。一位美国新闻记者于七月十八日评论这次旅行时，曾意味深长地写道，在麦克阿瑟总部里，华盛顿的高级客人们所领略的“不仅是总部对日本军事情况的观点，而且涉及亚洲广大区域的战略情况”。这位记者补充说：“大概还将讨论朝鲜和台湾的问题……”。
    东京会议过不多久就有结果了。朝鲜被选为美国侵略的主要对象，任命麦克阿瑟为它的组织者，麦克阿瑟曾经允诺在一个星期内结束“朝鲜的全部战斗”。
    但是，众所周知，麦克阿瑟的估计非常错误。美国装备和长期美国化的军队是无济于事的。李承晚匪军在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人民军打击之下都逃跑了。
    麦克阿瑟大发雷霆。他为了整顿溃乱的李承晚匪军，亲自飞到了南朝鲜。但是将军的咆哮并不能改变李承晚匪军继续向南逃窜的情况。
    在朝鲜的冒险不能借他人之手来进行，麦克阿瑟和他的主子弄明白了这一点。他们不得不把美国军队、空军、舰队开到朝鲜去，采取明目张胆的对朝鲜人民的军事侵略。美国侵略军的魁首，当然还是那个麦克阿瑟。
    朝鲜的爱国者进行着反抗美国侵略军的英勇斗争已经两个月了。他们在激烈战斗中，从自己的国土一步一步驱除外国侵略者。全副武装的美国侵略者在反对朝鲜英勇人民军的公开战斗中，表现出无力抵御的情势。
    大地在侵略者的脚下燃烧着。英勇的朝鲜游击队使侵略者日夜不安。麦克阿瑟将军变得更狂暴了。他野蛮轰炸和平的城市和乡村，杀戮数以千计的妇女、儿童和老人，这样地向朝鲜人民报复。
    麦克阿瑟憎恨着朝鲜人民。他把朝鲜人蔑视为“劣等的、有色的种族”。他跟随杜鲁门之后，称朝鲜人为“强盗”。美国的新闻记者报道说：“一个美国兵在后方遇见一个朝鲜人就怀疑起来，并开始射击他”。记者又无耻地附加道：“另一些美国兵先向朝鲜人开枪，然后再问话”……
    美国侵略者“怀疑”村庄里隐藏着游击队，把许多村庄放火烧了。对于被俘的游击队，在射死他们以前先击碎他们的脊骨。
    美国帝国主义者企图把朝鲜变成自己的殖民地，把朝鲜人民变为华尔街的顺从的奴隶。但是，骄傲的、爱好自由的朝鲜人民永远不会向美元和麦克阿瑟刽子手屈膝的。他们为争取自己祖国的自由与独立，将战至完全胜利。
