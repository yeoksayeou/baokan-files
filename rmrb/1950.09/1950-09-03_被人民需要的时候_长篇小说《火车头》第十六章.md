When Needed by the People
    -- Chapter 16 of the Novel "The Locomotive"
    Cao Ming
    Editor's Note: This novel is about the workers of a railway factory in Northeast China who actively produced, overcame difficulties, and devoted themselves to inventions before the liberation of Beijing. However, due to the conservatism of the management cadres and their lack of willingness to accept the reasonable suggestions of the workers, production took many detours. After the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in March last year, this factory began to transform. Through the efforts of the leading cadres and all the workers, the factory's production got on track. The whole book has twenty-three chapters, and this journal publishes Chapters 16 and 17. It describes the protagonist, young riveter Li Xuewen, and other workers who painstakingly researched and trial-produced welding rods in order to overcome difficulties in production, and created the technology of using electric welding instead of oxygen to cut iron plates. In this work, not only were difficulties overcome, but everyone was given new inspiration in production, and the relationship between workers was improved, combining production experience with scientific knowledge.

    Liu Guoliang personally opened the warehouse, but couldn't find a single bottle of oxygen; he called several factories to borrow, but they all said they couldn't get any either. He held an emergency meeting with the staff, but nothing was resolved. The cadres in the dormitory were racking their brains over the oxygen problem.

    Fang Xiaohong's pale face looked at this person and then that person, as if saying, "You are technically knowledgeable people, what should be done?" Yao Jifeng, Li Pengtian, and Old He all looked eagerly at Deputy Factory Director Liu. Liu Guoliang looked at Xiao Ziying, asking for help:

    "What about you, old riveter?..."

    Xiao Ziying shook his head, cautiously assessing his experience: "The technology in North Manchuria is not as good as here. I can't do it. I'll stick to my old ways. Tomorrow morning, I'll discuss it with the workers on the site. Everyone will contribute an idea, and a solution will come out."

    Fang Xiaohong pondered for a while and tentatively said, "I'll also ask my 'activists' tomorrow. They all have some creativity. Actually, I should have done this a long time ago - it's just that the trade union and the administration are not closely integrated. I should first make a self-criticism."

    Xiao Ziying eagerly asked, "Who are they?"

    "Lu Maolin from the foundry, Liu Jingkuan from the lathe, Old Han, and Li Xuewen from the riveting factory. They all talked to me about their creative plans. -"

    "Is that the riveter who wants to make welding rods? Right, I was just about to find Old Li's son. - Oh, he's a pretty good guy, but he's awfully stubborn and hard to approach." Xiao Ziying nodded. "I know the riveting work, it's heavy and risky. Sometimes you have to climb high and walk far, which makes you straightforward, unable to hold back your anger, and quick to fight. But this guy's craftsmanship is indeed good, and he's quick-witted -"

    Liu Guoliang listened carefully and then interjected, "Li Xuede's younger brother? We might as well ask him to try. Let me call him for a talk tomorrow. I, as the factory director, should have met workers like Li Xuewen a long time ago. It's just that I'm busy all day long - work is always passive. I believe he has a spirit of creation, but I'm just worried about him wasting things. I'm not afraid of his stubborn temper, as long as he knows how to cherish the equipment."

    That night, they decided that everyone would go to the masses to think of solutions the next day.

    When Li Xuewen arrived at the site, Liu Liangchen and several workers had already arrived early. He was talking to the welder Ye Yuanqing about what happened last night. As soon as Li Xuewen arrived, Old Liu asked him to repeat how to use electric welding instead of oxygen to cut iron plates. After he finished speaking, Li Xuewen emphasized, "I'm just afraid the electric generator won't hold up. Old Ye, let's go to the power plant together to find someone to discuss it with."

    As soon as they left, everyone was at a loss again. Liu Liangchen told them to prepare the electric welding equipment. As soon as the work bell rang, Lin Zhongxiu ran over, shouting, "Meeting! Director Xiao wants us to go to a meeting. Let's tell Director Xiao about Li Xuewen's idea."

    Someone turned off the switch and stopped the rotating machine. Someone dropped their tools and nimbly walked towards the small building. Deputy Director Deng hurriedly walked over, shouting loudly:

    "Li Xuewen, where are you? Factory Director Liu has a phone call for you, asking you to go to the factory director's office immediately." He shouted all the way, looking for that tall man in the crowd. He muttered to himself, "Good things never happen in our factory, but bad things always come. Really unlucky, who came up with the idea of repairing 'No. 7'!"

    "The idea is not bad, it's just that the materials are not suitable." Someone in the crowd retorted to Director Deng.

    "Not bad? Hmph - this time, it's a sure failure, and in the end, it's our riveting branch that will lose face! - But Li Xuewen is gone?"

    "Let me go call him." Little Chen volunteered.

    "Master Li, Li Xuewen, Comrade Fang from the trade union has a phone call for you, asking you to go immediately, saying they're waiting for you alone." A clerk who came from behind said breathlessly. Footsteps, voices, and anxious shouts mixed together. After everyone went upstairs, the site was immediately deserted, leaving only the person tempering the large wheel tending to the pile of charcoal fire.

    Li Xuewen and Ye Yuanqing arrived at the power branch factory and asked several people in a row, but no one had any clues. Li Xuewen asked a person standing in front of the motor for advice, but that person answered him with a shake of his head. They ran to the distribution panel and asked the Zhang guy. The Zhang guy glanced at the two riveters, then glanced at the distribution panel, and didn't say a word. Technician Dong Guixin walked over, asked what was going on, and then pointed out, "Increasing the voltage, we have it here - but your branch factory's generator -"

    "That's what I'm saying." Ye Yuanqing responded. "We're here to ask for advice!"

    "Then only your branch factory can think of a solution. You have to increase the voltage and protect the generator at the same time."

    "That's what I'm saying, but it can't be done both ways!" Ye Yuanqing responded again.

    Li Xuewen pondered and told Dong Guixin about his plan to design a water tank. After he finished speaking, he repeated a few sentences: "If we connect several thick wires, can't the current be increased? And if we find a box and put some water in it, wouldn't that reduce the heat and protect the generator? -" He raised his head and looked at the technician.

    The technician, like an examiner, asked as if he had prepared the questions in advance: "What if the water gets hot in a while?"

    "Find someone to watch it and constantly add cold water." Li Xuewen widened his eyes, as if waiting for the technician's approval.

    Dong Guixin nodded in agreement and added, "You also need to add some salt and use the water tank as an electrolytic cell. - The theory is plausible. Go back and try it. Once you find the box, give me a call and I'll come over to help you."

    Li Xuewen smiled happily, his round eyes also squeezed flat. He thought to himself, "This kind of technician is not bad. Who's like Li Muxi! " He and Old Ye thanked Technician Dong and left the power plant. As soon as they came out, Little Chen bumped into his master's chest. Li Xuewen supported his shoulder.

    Little Chen couldn't smile in time, he said breathlessly, "Factory Director Liu wants you to go to the factory director's office in the main building to see him. He wants you to go immediately."

    Li Xuewen walked into the factory director's office, and Liu Guoliang raised his head and asked, "What's the matter?"

    "Factory Director, were you looking for me?"

    Liu Guoliang looked at this riveter who was very honest and handsome, and realized, "Oh, are you called Li Xuewen? Are you Li Xuede's younger brother?"

    "Yes." Li Xuewen lowered his head shyly.

    "The two brothers don't look alike at all. You're a head taller than your brother."

    "Factory Director, what do you want me for?" He stared at the very dignified factory director.

    Liu Guoliang smiled generously, and then directly told him that there was no oxygen and the boiler plate could not be cut, asking him if he had a solution. Just as he was about to answer, Factory Director Liu touched on a thought and asked again, "Has your welding rod been successful?"

    Li Xuewen, who was originally happy, became ashamed after this question and said, "I'm sorry to our factory, the welding rod has not been successful yet -"

    Liu Guoliang immediately comforted him and said, "You are a good worker, Director Fang often mentions you two brothers. Your creative spirit is good, but your extravagance and waste of materials are wrong. If you invent something but waste a lot of materials, it's not worth it, understand? - This is not just my little tune as the factory director, it's just because that's all the people's property, and no one has the right to spoil it, is it?"

    Li Xuewen raised his head and looked at the factory director who was waiting for an answer, and blurted out, "Yes!"

    Both sides fell silent. In order to encourage the other party, Liu Guoliang smiled again and said, "This is your chance to make a contribution. You should put all your strength into it. If you can both create and save, that's really a hero."

    Li Xuewen swallowed and raised his head, telling him in detail about his plan to cut iron plates with electric welding. Factory Director Liu was very happy. He quickly stood up, patted him on the shoulder and said, "Your plan is very good. I wish you success this time. Whether or not 'No. 7' can make it depends on this. But be careful with the generator. Remember, don't let it be not worth it!" He also asked him when he could start, and he was ready to watch his experiment. He escorted him all the way to the door of the building.

    As soon as he returned to the site, Old Liu, Uncle Lin, and the others surrounded Li Xuewen, asking: What did the factory director call him to do? And they rushed to report to him: Director Xiao told him to quickly experiment with cutting iron plates with electric welding.

    Li Xuewen didn't say anything, just waved his arms excitedly and shouted, "Come on, Master Liu!" Although he was very excited, he still spoke very slowly. He turned to Uncle Lin and said, "Uncle Lin, find two people to help me carry that fire-fighting water tank from the lumber mill -" Before he could finish speaking, two young workers had already volunteered to go find the water tank with him. He nodded seriously and continued, "Uncle Lin, please call the power plant for me and ask Technician Dong to bring some thick wires in ten minutes. Uncle Lin, you find someone to help me wrap the wires, that's all. Right, Master Liu, you prepare the boiler plate and the welding equipment. That's all, let's do it."

    Xiao Ziying heard that Li Xuewen was experimenting with cutting iron plates with electric welding, and had already called the Brave Squad to come and help, and also asked the power plant to send someone to guide. Seeing Li Xuewen instructing people to do things, he smiled happily and said, "Master Li, you go find the water tank, I've already prepared everything for you. They're coming -" Before he could finish speaking, the propaganda committee member of the trade union wanted to come and interview for materials to write on the blackboard newspaper. The ten or so workers sent by the Brave Squad just happened to walk over,抢着说:"Foreman Lin, we're sent by the Brave Squad, we're told to come and help." "Just tell us what to do, we're from the lathe Brave Squad."

    The Brave Squad actually only had twenty-two people in total. Since they took the lead in the surprise attack and completed the production tasks last month, the "Brave Squad" had become famous in the factory. Lin Zhongxiu looked at them, frowned and said seriously, "You guys go back first, don't delay your work. We have enough manpower here, go back first."

    They wouldn't listen and all stayed; they were excitedly talking.

　　被人民需要的时候
    ——长篇小说《火车头》第十六章
    草明
    编者按：这篇小说是写北京解放前夕，东北某铁路工厂工人们积极生产，克服困难，并致力于发明创造。但由于管理干部的保守和不善于接受职工的合理化建议，使生产走了许多弯路。去年三月中共二中全会后，这个工厂开始转变，经过领导干部与全体职工的努力，该厂生产走上了轨道。全书共二十三章，本刊发表的是其中十六、十七两章。它描写书中主角青年铆工李学文和其他职工为了克服生产中的困难，苦心钻研，试制电焊条，并创造以电焊代替氧气割铁板的技术。在这个工作中，不但克服了困难，给大家在生产方面以新的启发，并且改善了职工关系，使生产经验与科学知识相结合。
    刘国梁亲自打开仓库，但是连一瓶氧气也找不到；打电话到几个工厂去借，都说他们也领不来，和职员们开了一个紧急会议，但是什么问题也没有解决。宿舍里的干部，都为氧气的问题而绞尽了脑汁。
    方晓红那张苍白的脸看看这个，瞅瞅那个，仿佛说：“你们是懂技术的人，这该怎么办呢？”姚吉丰、李鹏天、老何几个人热烈地望住了刘副厂长。刘国梁望住了萧子英，求援地问：
    “你这个老铆工怎么样呢？……”
    萧子英摇了摇头，稳重地估计了自己的经验：“北满的技术比不上这里的。我不行，还是用我的老办法，明天一早我在现场里和工友们合计合计，一人一嘴，办法就出来了。”
    方晓红沉思了一阵，试着说：“等明天我也来问问我的‘积极分子’，他们都有些创造性的。其实早就应该——这只怪工会和行政结合的不紧。我应先自我批评。”
    萧子英抢着问：“他们是些谁？”
    “翻砂的路茂林，旋盘的刘景宽，老韩头，还有那铆工厂的李学文，他们都找我谈过他们的创造计划。——”
    “就是要做电焊条那个铆工匠么？对了，老李头的儿子我正准备找他。——哦，他这个人倒是挺不错，只是倔的要命，不好接近。”萧子英点头道。“铆工我知道，铆工这个活重，又冒险，有时候爬也爬的高，走也走的远，养成了直冲的性子，一点气也蹩不住，动不动就干仗。这人手艺确是好，脑瓜灵活——”
    刘国梁注意听了，接着插嘴问：“李学德的弟弟么？不妨叫他试试。明天让我叫他来谈一次话。我这个厂长早就该和李学文这样的工友见见面。只是我一天到晚忙得——工作总陷于被动。这个人，我相信他有创造精神，只提防他浪费就行。不怕他脾气倔，只要他懂得爱惜器材。”
    当晚他们决定，明天各人分工到群众中去想办法。
    李学文到现场时，柳亮臣和几个工友已经早到了，他正和电焊匠叶元卿一块叨咕昨夜的事。李学文一到，老柳要他把怎样拿电焊代替氧气割铁板的事再说一遍。说完了，李学文着重地说：“就怕电缸抗不了。老叶，咱俩一道上动力厂去找人合计合计吧。”
    他们两个一走，大家又没了主意，柳亮臣叫准备电焊的东西。上班铃一响，林忠秀跑过来，嚷着说：“开会呀，萧主任叫咱们去开会。咱们就把李学文的办法说给萧主任听。”
    有人关上了电门，把刚转动的机器停住，有人撂下工具，敏捷地往小楼上走。邓副主任匆忙地走了过来，大声叫唤：
    “李学文，在哪？刘厂长有电话叫你立刻上厂长室去。”他一路嚷一路在众人中寻找那个高大的人。嘴里叨咕着：“好事偏偏不出在咱厂里，倒霉的事可来啦。真不走字，什么加修‘二七号’是谁出的主意呀！”
    “主意不坏呀，只是材料不趁手。”人群里有人反驳邓主任。
    “不坏？哼——这回的独头腊是坐定啦，到头来还不是咱铆工分厂丢脸！——可是李学文不见了呢？”
    “待我去叫他。”小陈自告奋勇。
    “李师傅，李学文，工会方同志有电话叫你马上去，说就等你一个人。”从后面赶来的一个公务员气喘着说。脚步声，讲话声，紧张的叫唤声，混成一片，等到人们都上楼去了之后，现场立刻冷清清，只剩煨大轮的人拨弄着那堆炭火。
    李学文和叶元卿到了动力分厂，一连问了几个人都没有什么头绪。李学文向一个站在看电机跟前的人请教，那人用摇头来回答他。他俩又跑到配电盘的跟前问那姓张的。那姓张的看了两个铆工一眼，又看配电盘一眼，没吱声。技术员董桂新走了过来，问明白是什么事，才指点说：“提高电压，咱们这里倒——只是你们分厂的电缸——”
    “谁说不是哩。”叶元卿应声说。“咱俩就是来请教啦！”
    “那只有你们分厂里想办法，一面提高电压，一面又要保护电缸。”
    “谁说不是呢，就不能两全其美呀！”叶元卿又应声说。
    李学文沉思着，把自己准备设计一只水箱的计划对董桂新说出来。说完了，又重复了几句：“接上几股粗线，电流不是可以增加？再找个箱子，里面放上点水，这样是不是可以减少电热，电缸就保住了？——”他抬起头望着技术员。
    技术员像口试的先生，早就准备好了题目似地问道：“水一会就热啦，又怎么办？”
    “找人看着，不断添凉水。”李学文瞪大了眼睛，好像等待技术员的批准。
    董桂新点头同意，加添说：“还要加点盐，把水箱当电解槽。——道理说的过去。你回去试试。箱子找好了，你来个电话，我过去帮帮你的忙。”
    李学文高兴得笑了，圆眼睛也给挤扁了。心里想道：“这样的技术员还不大离。谁象李慕西那样子！他和老叶向董技术员道了谢就离开了动力厂。刚一出门口，冒冒失失的小陈一撞就撞在师傅的心口上。李学文扶住了他的肩膀。
    小陈来不及笑，喘气说：“刘厂长叫你上大楼厂长室去见他。叫你立刻去。”
    李学文走进厂长室，刘国梁抬起头来问：“什么事？”
    “厂长，你找我么？”
    刘国梁望了望这个长的十分敦厚和俊秀的铆工，醒悟地问：“唔，你是不是叫李学文？是李学德的弟弟吗？”
    “是的。”李学文羞涩地低下头。
    “兄弟俩一点不像，你比你哥哥高一脑瓜。”
    “厂长叫我有什么事？”他瞪起眼睛望着十分体面庄严的厂长。
    刘国梁大方的笑一笑，随即直接了当地告诉他氧气没有了，锅炉板割不开问他有办法没有。他正想开口回答，刘厂长触动了心事，又问道：“你的电焊条成功了没有？”
    李学文原来高高兴兴经过这一问，却羞愧起来，说：“我对不起咱厂，电焊条还没有成——”
    刘国梁立刻安慰他说：“你是个好工友，方主任常常提起你两兄弟。你的创造精神是好的，但是你的大手大脚，浪费材料是不对的，如果发明了一样东西，可浪费了不少的材料，这叫得不偿失，懂么？——这不是我当厂长的小调，只因为那都是人民的财产，谁也没有权力糟塌它，是不是？”
    李学文抬起头看看那位等待回答的厂长，就脱口而出地说：“是！”
    两下都沉默起来，刘国梁为要鼓励对方，又微笑着说：“这是你立功的机会啦，你应把所有的力量都拿出来。既能创造，又能节省，这真是英雄好汉。”
    李学文咽了一口唾沫，抬起了头，一五一十地把自己拿电焊割铁板的计划告诉了他。刘厂长很高兴。连忙站起来拍他肩膀说：“你这计划很好，这一回祝你成功。‘二七号’赶不赶趟，全在这上面了。可要注意电缸。记住，不要得不偿失！”他又问他什么时候可以动手，他准备去看他试验。他一直把他送出大楼的门口。
    一回到现场，老柳、林叔他们早就围上来问李学文：厂长叫他去做什么？又抢着报告他：萧主任叫他赶快试验拿电焊来割铁板。
    李学文没有说什么，只兴奋地挥着手臂，叫道：“来吧，柳师傅！”他虽然很兴奋，但是话还是说的很慢，他转向林叔道：“林叔，找两个人帮我去抬制材厂那只消防水箱——”他还没说完，两个年青工友已抢先报名要跟他去找水箱。他严肃的点了点头，说下去，“林叔，你代我给动力厂去个电话，叫董技术员过十分钟带点粗线来。林叔，你就找个人来帮我缠线，再没什么啦。对了，柳师傅你把锅炉板、电焊用具都准备好。再没什么了，就这么的吧。”
    萧子英听说李学文试验用电焊来割铁板，早就打电话叫奋勇小队过来帮忙，又叫动力厂派个人来指导。当下看见李学文指点人们去做事，他就快活地笑着说：“李师傅你去找水箱去吧，我都替你准备好啦。他们就来——”他话还没有说完，工会的宣传委员要来采访材料去写黑板报。奋勇小队派来的十来个工友正好走过来，抢着说：“林班长，咱们是奋勇小队派来的，叫我们来帮忙。”“有事尽管支使我们好啦，我们是旋盘奋勇小队的。”
    奋勇小队其实一共才二十二个人，自从上月他们带头突击，完成生产任务以后，“奋勇小队”在厂里就有了名。林忠秀看了看他们，皱起眉心沉着地说：“你们先回去吧，别耽误你们的活。咱们这儿人手还能对付得了，先回去吧。”
    他们那里肯听，都留下来了；兴高采烈地抢着说话。
                                   （本章未完，下期续登）
