　　"We must build a People's Army with culture"
　　Soldiers Yang Zaoqi and others report their study achievements to Chairman Mao

Dear Chairman Mao:

　　Thanks to your correct leadership, the entire Chinese people have defeated the Japanese invaders, overthrown the reactionary Kuomintang government, and established our own people's country.

　　On this first National Day, we have no other gift, only to report to you our learning situation and future determination under the education and cultivation of the Party and superiors.

　　Each of our comrades is studying with a fighting spirit. From January of this year to the present, all comrades in the class have learned to calculate integers, decimals, four arithmetic operations, and simple fractions. Everyone is learning very humbly, helping each other, and studying patiently. Many comrades say: "Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu are very concerned about our learning and have cultivated many cultural cadres to teach us culture. If we don't study hard, we will be letting down the Chinese people!" Some comrades also said: "In the past, how could we poor people afford to study? Now the public takes care of our food, drink, and clothing. If we don't study, we are just willingly lagging behind!" Everyone's learning enthusiasm is very high, and they are full of determination to defend the motherland and world peace. Everyone said: "We must resolutely respond to the call of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to build a strong national defense force—a People's Army that can not only fight, but also everyone can write and calculate!"

　　“我们要建设一支有文化的人民军队”
    战士杨造岐等向毛主席报告学习成绩亲爱的毛主席：
    由于你的正确的领导，全中国人民已打败了日寇，推翻了国民党反动政府，而建立了人民自己的国家。
    在这第一个国庆日，我们没有别的礼物，只把我们在党和上级的教育培养下的学习情况和今后的决心报告给你。
    我们每个同志都以战斗的精神，进行着学习。从今年正月到现在，全班同志都已学会演算整数、小数、四则和简单的分数了。大家都很虚心地学习着，互相帮助，耐心钻研。很多同志都这样说：“毛主席和朱总司令很关心我们的学习，培养了许多文化干部来教我们学文化。我们如再不好好学习，可真对不起中国人民啦！”也有的同志说：“从前咱穷人那能念得上书呀？现在公家管吃管喝还管穿，要不念，那真是自甘落后了！”大家的学习情绪都非常高涨，对保卫祖国和世界和平，都满怀决心。大家说：“我们要坚决响应毛主席和朱总司令的号召，建设一支强大的国防军——一支不但会打仗，而且人人会写会算的有文化的人民军队！”
