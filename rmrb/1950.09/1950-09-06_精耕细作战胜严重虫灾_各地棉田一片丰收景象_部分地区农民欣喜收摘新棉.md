[Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang Special District has begun harvesting new cotton, and farmers are welcoming the cotton harvest with joy. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Shijiazhuang Special District was a well-known cotton-producing area; farmers in counties such as Shulu, Jin, Gaocheng, Zhengding, Zhao, and Huolu have many years of cotton planting habits and are experienced. This year, the district planted a total of more than 2.2 million mu of cotton, exceeding the pre-war area by approximately 270,000 mu. After half a year of intensive cultivation and overcoming continuous disasters, the cotton plants have thick branches and lush leaves, with flowers and bolls all over the branches. Each branch has an average of more than ten flowers and bolls, some of which have already cracked and started to be harvested. On August 26th, at the Zhengding city market, about 5,000 to 6,000 jin of new seed cotton were on the market, and about 300 jin of new lint cotton were also on the market.

The abundant harvest of cotton this year is attributed to the strong support of the people's government for cotton farmers. The Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative has supplied farmers with more than 6 million jin of cotton seeds and 25 million jin of fine fertilizer (including a portion supplied by the bank) through loans, sales, and exchanges. After the start of cotton planting, governments at all levels took leading the masses in cotton planting as the primary task. Various organs, groups, troops (Sub-district Command, Independent Battalion), and schools also dispatched more than 5,000 cadres detached from production to help farmers with shock cotton planting. At the end of the planting period, the government discovered that some cotton fields did not have full seedlings and promptly issued calls to check seedlings, replant seedlings, and check survival rates. Those with uneven seedlings were replanted. After the end of cotton planting, the special district immediately grasped technical guidance, and established cotton cultivation technical training classes (training objects were agricultural section chiefs from various counties, production assistants from districts, technical extension cadres from farms, experienced model laborers in cotton planting, etc.); various counties also conducted technical training for village cadres and organized district cadres to learn cotton cultivation. Generally, district and village cadres have learned the scientific principles and methods of preparing insecticide agents and transplanting cotton seedlings, as well as thinning seedlings, setting seedlings, topdressing, watering, weeding, and controlling aphids. Through them, the cotton planting technology of farmers has been greatly improved, enabling cotton seedlings to grow robustly.

However, the key to this year's cotton harvest is that the government led the farmers to overcome the severe insect pests. As early as mid-May, Jin and Shulu counties conducted education on weeding and aphid prevention for farmers through teachers and students; a weeding shock campaign was launched throughout the special district, and aphid prevention preparation work was promoted. At the end of May, aphids generally occurred throughout the special district, and the affected cotton fields accounted for 70% to 80% of all cotton fields. For example, Shulu County had a total of 354,561 mu of cotton fields, of which 250,000 mu were affected by aphids. The special district and county leaders, on the one hand, instructed their subordinates to "complete the aphid control work as a serious political task, discover and eliminate them on the spot"; on the other hand, they transferred 850 cadres from various departments, 2,056 elementary school teachers (during the wheat harvest holiday), in conjunction with all district cadres, to go deep into the villages with emphasis to lead the masses to eliminate and control. The Shijiazhuang Guidance Area of the Provincial Cotton Production Improvement Office, the North China Farm, and the Xinji Farm also dispatched a large number of technical cadres and lent out 2,000 sprayers to guide farmers in using them for elimination and control. In addition, the Special District and County Supply and Marketing Cooperatives prepared a large amount of tobacco leaves and lime for cotton farmers to use as insecticides. At first, some farmers had the erroneous idea of ​​"cotton flowers clenched in a fist, one year is worth two years," and were only eager to harvest wheat and weed seedlings, and showed neglect in aphid control; the leadership also only stayed at the stage of key trials and expanded publicity by cadres. Later, after the special district leadership proposed "aphid control is the top priority at present," concentrated all efforts, and led the masses to carry out shock elimination and control, a mass aphid eradication movement was formed. By the end of June, Yuanshi, Gaoyi, Huolu, Lingshou and other counties had universally treated 300,000 mu of cotton fields that had aphids once (many were treated three times), and Shulu, Jin and other ten counties, although the cotton field area was large, also rushed to treat most of them. After sun exposure and rainstorms, cotton aphids gradually disappeared. This victory not only preserved the cotton harvest, but also improved farmers' aphid eradication technology and confidence, laying a better foundation for future cotton production increase. In early July, as soon as the cotton aphids were eliminated, red spiders occurred in 80% of the cotton fields in the district. The momentum was extremely fierce. Deputy Commissioner Cui Minsheng of the Special Commissioner's Office and Guo Fang, secretary of the CPC District Committee, and three District Committee members immediately led cadres to the countryside to inspect and lead the masses to quickly eliminate and control them. The counties also attached great importance to this. Counties with severe disasters temporarily stopped other work and fully led the masses to fight against red spiders. Jin County put forward the slogan "seize cotton from the mouth of red spiders" and temporarily suspended the party congress that had been prepared. The Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative and Native Produce Company supplied sufficient sulfur (used to prepare sulfur-lime mixture). After a month of intense struggle by farmers throughout the district, the spread of red spiders stopped by the end of July, and basically achieved elimination by the beginning of August. The victory in the fight against red spiders once again preserved the growth of cotton. Only about nearly 2% of the cotton lost its leaves due to severe disasters, and the production was reduced partially or completely, and some of these cotton fields have been partially converted to buckwheat or vegetables.

The victory of the two battles against serious insect pests has encouraged the cotton farmers' production enthusiasm. Now the farmers in the special district are continuing to carry out the work of pruning branches and topping, summarizing and studying insect control experience, always vigilant about possible insect pest infestations, and welcoming the fruits of their hard work - the cotton harvest - with joy.

[Yuncheng News] The one million mu of cotton fields in the Yuncheng Special District, Shanxi, have now been hoeed four times. Each cotton plant has as many as a dozen cotton bolls, and the less have seven or eight bolls. They are full of branches, a scene of abundant harvest. In early August, Yuncheng, Linjin, Yuxiang, Yongji and other counties have partially started to harvest new cotton. This is the result of the region’s cotton farmers' cultivation and elimination of weeds and pests. As early as before cotton planting, most cotton fields had been cultivated three times and harrowed four times. In some areas, spades were used to turn the soil and loosen the soil. According to statistics from seven counties and forty-five villages, among 483,000 mu of cotton fields, 293,000 mu were plowed three times, and 36,300 mu were plowed more than four times. Fertilization was also generally higher than in previous years. According to statistics from 396,000 mu of cotton fields in 75 villages in eight counties, an average of two and a half large carts of fertilizer were applied per mu. Seed soaking work during cotton planting was also relatively common. After sowing, cotton farmers actively cultivated meticulously, prevented insect pests, hoeed out weeds, watered to combat drought, creating the good results of the current promising harvest.

[Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 2nd] Farmers in the Central South Region have begun harvesting new cotton. This year, the Central South Region planted more than 10 million mu of cotton. Except for the areas around Shanzhou and Lingbao in Henan Province, where the cotton bolls are relatively small due to the dry climate, and another 1 million mu of cotton fields in other places that have reduced production due to waterlogging and other disasters, the famous cotton producing areas such as Jingzhou and Shashi in western Hubei, Luoyang and Zhengzhou in Henan, and Huarong and Nanxian in Hunan, have cotton fields with numerous bolls, large cotton bolls, and clean white cotton. In the cotton fields around the Dongting Lake area of ​​Hunan Province and the Luoyang area of ​​Henan Province, each mu can harvest more than 30 jin of lint cotton. It is estimated that the region can harvest about 3 million dan of cotton this autumn, an increase of about one-third compared with last year.

This year, governments at all levels in the Central South Region have attached great importance to ensuring increased cotton production. Henan and Hunan provinces distributed more than 12 million jin of grain as fertilizer loans for cotton fields this spring, partially solving the problem of lack of fertilizer for farmers. When cotton aphid pests occurred in various cotton producing areas, the Central South Agricultural and Forestry Department allocated 7.6 million jin of rice for insect control funds and established 13 prevention and control stations throughout the region, thereby preventing the spread of cotton aphids and ensuring the normal development of cotton seedlings. This year, the production enthusiasm of cotton farmers in various places is also high. For example, farmers in Henan cultivated cotton fields as many as five to eight times, and cotton fields in Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces also hoeed an average of three to five times.

To cooperate with cotton harvesting, the Central South Agricultural and Forestry Department will soon promulgate selection methods for establishing improved seed promotion areas and ordinary cotton fields, guiding farmers in various places to select and store high-quality cotton seeds.

　　精耕细作战胜严重虫灾
  　各地棉田一片丰收景象
  　部分地区农民欣喜收摘新棉
    【本报石家庄讯】石家庄专区已开始收摘新棉，农民正以满怀愉快的心情，迎接棉花丰收。抗日战争以前，石家庄专区一带即为有名的棉产区；束鹿、晋县、藁城、正定、赵县、获鹿等县农民，更有多年种棉习惯，并富有经验。今年全区共植棉二百二十余万亩，超过抗战前约二十七万亩。经过半年来的加工培育，并战胜了不断发生的灾害，棉株枝粗叶茂，花桃满枝，每枝花桃平均都在十个以上，有的并已开裂，开始收摘。八月二十六日正定城集市上，新籽棉上市约有五、六千斤，新皮棉市上亦有三百余斤。
    今年棉花的丰收，得助于人民政府对棉农的有力扶植，专区供销社曾以贷、卖、换三种方法，供给农民棉籽六百余万斤；细肥二千五百万斤（内有银行供给的一部）。植棉开始后，各级人民政府即以领导群众植棉为首要任务。各机关、团体、部队（分区司令部、独立营）、学校，并抽出脱离生产干部五千余人，帮助农民突击种棉。种棉末期，政府发现有的棉田出苗不全，即及时提出查苗、补苗、查成活率等号召，苗不齐的都进行了补种。植棉结束后，专区即抓紧技术指导，开办了整棉技术训练班（训练对象为各县农业科长、区生产助理员，农场技术推广干部，植棉有经验的劳动模范等）；各县也普遍对村干部进行了技术训练，并组织区干部学习整棉。一般区村干部都学会了配制杀虫药剂和移棉苗的方法，以及间苗、定苗、追肥、浇水、除草、治蚜等科学原理及办法。并经过他们，大大提高了农民的植棉技术，使棉苗得以茁壮生长。
    但是，今年棉花的丰收，其关键还是政府领导农民战胜了严重的虫灾。早在五月中旬，晋县、束鹿即通过教员、学生向农民进行了除草与防蚜教育；全专区展开了锄草突击旬，并推动了防蚜准备工作。五月底，全专区普遍发生蚜虫，受害棉田占全部棉田的百分之七、八十。如束鹿县共棉田三十五万四千五百六十一亩，就有二十五万亩受到蚜害。专、县领导上，一面指示所属：“把治蚜工作当成严重的政治任务去完成，就地发现，就地消灭”；一面从各部门抽调干部八百五十人，小学教师二千零五十六人（时值麦假期间），协同全体区干部，有重点地深入到村，领导群众除治。省棉产改进处石家庄指导区、华北农场、辛集农场等也派遣了大批技术干部，借出两千架喷雾器，指导农民使用除治。此外，专县供销社并准备了大批烟叶、石灰，供给棉农作杀虫之用。起初有些农民还有“棉花攒攒拳，一年顶二年”的错误说法，只急于收麦、锄苗，而对除蚜表现忽视；领导上也还只停留在干部重点试治与扩大宣传阶段。后经专区领导上提出“治蚜为当前第一位任务”，集中全力，领导群众突击除治，始形成群众性的灭蚜运动。到六月底，元氏、高邑、获鹿、灵寿等县，把生过棉蚜的三十万亩棉田普治了一遍（多的治到三遍），束鹿、晋县等十县，棉田面积虽大，也抢治了大部。后经太阳曝晒和暴风雨吹打，棉蚜始逐渐灭迹。这一胜利，不仅保住了棉花的收成，并提高了农民的灭蚜技术和信心，为今后棉花增产奠定了更好的基础。七月初，棉蚜甫告消灭，又在全区百分之八十的棉田里发生了火龙（红蜘蛛），来势异常凶险，专署崔民生副专员和中共地委书记郭芳及三个地委委员，立即率领干部下乡检查，并领导群众迅速除治。各县对此亦极重视，灾重县份暂时停止了其他工作，全力领导群众向火龙作斗争。晋县提出“从火龙嘴里夺棉花”的口号，将已准备就绪的党代会也暂时停开。专区供销社、土产公司供给了充足的硫磺（配治硫磺石灰合剂用）。经过全区农民一月的紧张斗争，至七月底火龙停止了蔓延，八月初基本上达到消灭。与火龙斗争的胜利，再一次保住棉花的生长。只有约近百分之二的棉花因灾重而脱落了叶子，减产了一部或全部，而这些棉田已部分地改种了荞麦或菜蔬。
    两次与严重虫害斗争的胜利，鼓舞了棉农的生产情绪。现该专区农民正在继续进行整枝、顶尖工作，总结、研究除虫经验，时刻警惕可能发生的虫害侵袭，并以欢欣的心情，迎接自己辛勤劳动的果实——棉花的丰收。

    【本报运城讯】山西运城专区的一百万余亩棉田，现已普锄四遍，每株棉桃多至十几颗，少者也有七、八颗，累累盈枝，一片丰收气象。八月上旬，运城、临晋、虞乡、永济等县均已部分开始收摘新棉。这是全区棉农加工耕作和铲除了杂草害虫后获得的果实。早在棉花播种前，大部棉田均作到耕三耙四，部分地区用锹翻地松土，据七个县又四十五个村的统计，四十八万三千亩棉田中，有二十九万三千亩犁过三遍，三万六千三百亩犁过四遍以上。施肥也一般超过往年，据八个县七十五个村三十九万六千亩棉田统计，每亩平均施肥两大车半。植棉中浸种工作也较普遍。播种后，棉农积极加工细作，防止虫害，锄除杂草，浇地抗旱，造成目前可望丰收的良好结果。

    【新华社汉口二日电】中南区各省农民已开始收摘新棉。中南全区今年植棉达一千余万亩。除了河南省陕州、灵宝一带因气候干旱，棉桃较为瘦小，其他各地另有一百余万亩棉田因有水旱等灾减产以外，著名棉产区如鄂西荆州、沙市，河南洛阳、郑州，湖南华容、南县等地的棉田，均结桃累累，棉桃硕大，棉绒洁白。湖南省滨洞庭湖地区和河南省洛阳一带的棉田，每亩均可收皮棉三十市斤以上。预计全区今秋约可收棉三百万担左右，即可比去年增产三分之一。
    今年中南区各级人民政府对保证棉花增产极为重视。河南、湖南两省今春即曾发放棉田肥料贷粮一千二百余万斤，部分地解决了农民的缺乏肥料的困难。各产棉区发生棉蚜虫害时，中南农林部曾拨发治虫经费大米七百六十万斤，在全区设立了十三个防治站，因而制止了棉蚜蔓延，保证了棉苗的正常发育。今年各地植棉农民生产情绪也高。如河南农民对棉田中耕多达五次到八次，湖北、湖南、江西三省棉田也平均锄了三遍到五遍。
    配合收棉工作，中南农林部即将颁布关于设立良种推广区和普通棉田的选种办法，领导各地农民选存优良棉种。
