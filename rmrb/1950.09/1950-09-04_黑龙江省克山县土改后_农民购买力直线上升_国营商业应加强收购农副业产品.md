　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 31st: An investigation in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, shows that the increase in farmers' purchasing power in the county over the past two years has been a straight upward trend. This can represent the general trend of rural economic development after land reform in northern Manchuria.

　　Democratic Village in Keshan County is a village of about a hundred households, neither large nor small. In 1948, the average purchasing power per household in the village was 3.61 million Northeast currency, 4.9 million in 1949, and more than 9.49 million this year, an increase of 163 percent compared to two years ago. As farmers become wealthier, the proportion of purchases of means of production and means of livelihood has also changed. In 1948, the cost of purchasing means of production in the village accounted for 11.8 percent of the total expenditure, increasing to 23 percent this year, and is planned to increase to 33.7 percent next year. According to statistics from Keshan County, farmers will purchase 5,000 more horses, 1,770 carts, more than 110,000 sacks, and many other farm tools this winter and next spring. Such a large amount of farm tools has not been purchased in the past, which shows that farmers are carrying out expanded reproduction. In terms of means of livelihood, eleven kinds of materials such as cloth, cotton, fur coats, *wula*, fur hats, thread, wine, kerosene, soybean oil, salt, and socks account for 86 percent of the total livelihood expenditure of farmers in the county, among which the increase in cloth is the most significant. In 1948, the average demand for cloth per person in Democratic Village was 16.3 *chi*, which suddenly increased to 27.8 *chi* in 1949, and is 36.5 *chi* this year. Liu Zian, a middle peasant in Minzhong Village in the county, said: "My family uses 30 *chi* of cloth per person this year, and may have 48 *chi* next year, and 72 *chi* if it is ideal." Farmers in the county now also need timber for building houses, as well as food for the New Year and festivals, and stationery and paper.

　　The source of farmers' purchasing power lies entirely in the sale of agricultural and sideline products. Among the things sold by farmers in Keshan County, grain accounts for 92.4 percent, followed by pigs and eggs. Therefore, state-owned commerce in Northeast China has always attached importance to the purchase and sale of agricultural and sideline products. However, this work must be strengthened, and it is also necessary to accurately grasp the quantity of output and organize cooperatives and private merchants to purchase in a timely and planned manner.

　　黑龙江省克山县土改后
    农民购买力直线上升       
    国营商业应加强收购农副业产品
    【新华社沈阳三十一日电】黑龙江省克山县的调查说明：该县两年来农民购买力的提高是直线上升的。这可以代表北满土地改革后农村经济发展的一般趋势。
    克山县民主村是一个百户左右不大不小的村庄，一九四八年该村每户的平均购买力为东北币三百六十一万元，一九四九年为四百九十万元，今年为九百四十九万多元，较前年增加了百分之一百六十三。农民富裕后，购买生产资料和生活资料的比重也发生了变化。一九四八年，该村购买生产资料的费用，占总支出的百分之十一点八，今年增加到百分之二十三，明年根据该村计划将增加到百分之三十三点七。克山全县统计：今冬明春农民将增购马五千匹，车一千七百七十辆，麻袋十一万多条和其他农具很多。这样大量的添置农具在过去是没有的，这说明农民在进行着扩大的再生产。在生活资料方面，布、棉花、皮袄、靰鞡、皮帽、线、酒、煤油、豆油、食盐、袜子等十一种物资占该县农民生活总支出的百分之八十六，其中布的增加最为显著。一九四八年民主村每人平均需布十六点三尺，一九四九年突增至二十七点八尺，今年则为三十六点五尺。该县民众村中农刘子安说：“我家今年每人用三十尺布，明年可以有四十八尺，合乎理想得七十二尺。”该县农民现在还需要盖房用的木材，和过年过节吃的东西以及文具纸张等。
    农民购买力的来源，全在于农业和副业产品的推销。克山县农民出卖的东西中，粮食占百分之九十二点四，其次为猪、鸡蛋。因此，东北国营商业对农业和副业产品的收购和推销向即重视。但这一工作还须加强，还要作到切实掌握产量数量，及时地、有计划地组织合作社和私商收购。
