　　The patriotic declaration titled "The Way for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of New China," jointly issued by the first group of more than 1,500 Chinese Christians, calls on Christians nationwide to sever ties between the church and imperialist countries, implement self-government, self-support, and self-propagation, to achieve the goal of reforming Chinese Christianity. This declaration, signed by many prominent figures in Chinese Christianity, states the political stance that Christians in New China should have: opposing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; opposing war and supporting peace. It also points out the correct direction for the efforts of religious circles in China. As stated in the letter soliciting signatures, "This declaration is a historically significant document for Chinese Christianity." We believe that the people of the whole country, like the vast majority of patriotic Christians nationwide, will warmly welcome this declaration.
    The activities of Christianity and Catholicism in China include two aspects. On the one hand, these two religions have many kind believers in China who are both believers and patriotic citizens. They hope for national independence, prosperity, freedom, and democracy, and therefore support the political and social reforms carried out by the People's Government. On the other hand, due to historical reasons, these two religions have various connections with foreign imperialism. As everyone knows, these two religions were introduced into China on a large scale only more than a hundred years ago. At that time, foreign missionaries came from afar, in the words of the first American Christian missionary to China, Bridgman, "less for religious reasons and more for political reasons." Many of them were sent to China by their governments along with opium dealers and gunboats to act as intelligence personnel and pioneers of aggression. They relied on successive imperialist wars of aggression and unequal treaties to continuously expand their power. Many missionaries colluded with Chinese feudal landlords, bureaucrats, and compradors, resorting to trickery and coercion to oppress the good and honest, leading to many serious rebellions among the Chinese people, leaving behind a history of blood and tears. Examples of collusion between church personnel and the Kuomintang in anti-communist and anti-people activities include, from further back, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the intelligence activities of the Belgian-national Le Mouan and the American-national Megnin, who once served as the Bishop of the Catholic Xinxiang Diocese, in the areas of northern Shaanxi, southern Shanxi, and northwestern Henan, under the French Catholic system and the American system. More recently, there are the espionage cases in Xingtai, Qiqihar, Xianxian, and Shenyang, which were successively uncovered during the Liberation War. It is precisely because of these situations that have caused conscientious people in religious circles to feel heartbroken and deeply disturbed, and have led to the current vigorous reform movement.
    The religious policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Government is consistent and clear. Article 5 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that the people have freedom of religious belief, that is, freedom to believe in religion, and also freedom to refuse to believe in religion. Both aspects of freedom are protected by law. Religious belief should be absolutely separated from foreign aggression and counter-revolutionary activities, and should not be confused with them; those harmful activities are to be banned by the People's Government. The People's Government neither interferes with freedom of religious belief because it bans those harmful activities, nor does it tolerate those harmful activities because it protects freedom of religious belief.
    Some people ask: Since Communists are thorough atheists, why do they advocate allowing freedom of religious belief? This is because religion arises and exists when human beings, facing what they perceive as irresistible natural and social laws, turn to mysterious phenomena for help. Therefore, religion will only disappear when humanity has sufficient power to control nature and completely eliminates the system of class oppression and its remnants. Before that, when some human beings continue to rely on natural forces due to technological backwardness, and when some human beings have not yet been able to escape the slavery of capitalism and feudalism, the phenomenon of religion cannot universally disappear from human society. Therefore, any opinion that takes coercive action on purely religious belief issues is both futile and harmful. Therefore, we advocate protecting freedom of religious belief, just as we protect freedom to refuse religious belief. However, if the church is used as a tool for imperialist aggression against China and for counter-revolutionaries to oppose the People's Government, then it violates the interests of the people's state and also violates the original will of all honest religious believers. Those special agents who use religion as a cover to carry out sabotage and espionage activities (not ordinary believers who have not committed crimes), regardless of which religion they profess, and regardless of whether they are foreigners or Chinese, should be punished as they deserve according to the provisions of Article 7 of the Common Program.
    It is precisely from this standpoint that we welcome the self-government, self-support, and self-propagation movement initiated by Christian figures. This is a patriotic movement that Chinese Christians should undertake to separate Chinese Christianity from imperialist influence and embark on the correct path of religion. They call for severing ties with imperialism, implementing self-reliance, and transforming the church from a foreign agency into a Chinese agency, thereby also ensuring that the undertakings carried out by the church no longer serve the interests of imperialism. The success of this movement will give Chinese Christianity new life and change the Chinese people's perception of Christianity, because they have clearly distinguished their religious activities from imperialist aggression against China, and do not confuse the two. Therefore, we believe that the declaration of more than 1,500 Christian figures will not only be supported by patriotic Christians, but will also be responded to by patriotic Catholics. Believers of all religions can gain a correct direction from this. Only by moving in this direction can religious circles establish their own normal religious undertakings.

### 基督教人士的爱国运动

　　基督教人士的爱国运动
    中国基督教人士第一批一千五百多人联名发表的以“中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径”为题的宣言，号召全国基督教徒割断教会与帝国主义国家的关系，实行自治、自养、自传，以达到革新中国基督教的目标。由中国基督教许多著名人士签名发表的这篇宣言，申明了基督教徒在新中国所应有的反对帝国主义、封建主义、和官僚资本主义的、反对战争拥护和平的政治立场，并指出了中国宗教界的正确的努力方向。诚如征求签名的信上所说，“这篇宣言是中国基督教一个有历史意义的文件。”我们相信全国人民当与全国绝大多数爱国的基督教徒一样，对这篇宣言表示热忱的欢迎。
    基督教和天主教在中国的活动都包含两个方面。在一方面，这两个宗教在中国有很多善良的教徒，他们是教徒，同时又是爱国的公民，他们希望国家独立富强和自由民主，因而拥护人民政府所进行的政治改革和社会改革。在另一方面，这两个宗教又由于历史的原因，与外国帝国主义发生了种种不同的联系。大家知道，这两个宗教都是在一百多年前才大规模地由外国传入中国的。当时外国教士之不远万里而来，用第一个来到中国的美国基督教教士裨治文牧师的话来说，“与其说是由于宗教的原因，毋宁说是由于政治的原因”。他们中间的很多人是由本国政府跟鸦片贩子和炮舰一起派到中国来做情报人员和侵略先锋的。他们依靠一次连接一次的帝国主义侵略战争和不平等条约不断扩大其势力。有许多传教士与中国的封建地主、官僚、买办相结托，巧取豪夺，欺压善良，以至在中国人民中引起了许多次严重的反抗，在我们的历史上留下了血泪斑斑的事迹。教会人员与美蒋勾结进行反共反人民活动的事例，稍远如抗日战争期间，法国天主教系统的雷鸣远（比籍）和美国系统曾任天主教新乡教区主教的米甘（美籍）在陕北、晋南和豫西北一带的情报活动。最近如解放战争中连续被破获的邢台、齐齐哈尔、献县和沈阳的间谍案。正由于有这种种情形，才引起了宗教界有识之士的痛心疾首，才引起了目前的蓬蓬勃勃的改革运动。
    中国共产党和中国人民政府的宗教政策是一贯的和明确的。人民政协共同纲领第五条规定人民有宗教信仰自由，即有信仰宗教之自由，也有拒绝信仰宗教之自由，这两方面的自由同受法律的保护。宗教信仰应当绝对与外国侵略活动以及反革命活动相分离，而不应当把它们混淆起来；那些危害活动是要被人民政府所取缔的。人民政府既不因为取缔那些危害活动而干涉宗教信仰自由，也不因为保护宗教信仰自由而容忍那些危害活动。
    有人问：共产党人既然是彻底的无神论者，那么，为什么又主张允许宗教信仰自由呢？这是因为，宗教是产生和存在于人类面对着他们认为不可抗衡的自然法则和社会法则而求助于神秘现象的时候，因此，只有在人类有足够的力量支配自然，并彻底消灭了阶级压迫制度及其遗迹以后，宗教才会走向消灭。在此以前，当一部分人类由于技术落后而对自然力量继续存在着依赖的时候，当一部分人类还没有能够摆脱资本主义和封建主义的奴役的时候，宗教的现象是不可能从人类社会中普遍消失的。因此，对于纯粹宗教信仰问题，任何采取强制行动的意见都是无益而有害的。因此，我们主张保护宗教信仰的自由，如同保护拒绝宗教信仰的自由一样。但是，教会如果被利用来作为帝国主义侵略中国和反革命分子反对人民政府的工具，那就违反了人民国家的利益，也违反了一切诚实的宗教信仰者原来的意志。那些利用宗教掩护进行破坏活动和间谍活动的特务分子（不是没有犯罪的普通教徒），不论他们标榜那一种宗教，也不论他们是外国人或中国人，就都应当按照共同纲领第七条的规定，受到应有的惩处。
    正是从这种立场出发，我们欢迎基督教人士所发起的自治、自养、自传运动。这是基督教人士应有的使中国基督教脱离帝国主义影响而走上宗教正轨的爱国运动。他们号召割断与帝国主义的关系，实行自力更生，使教会从外国人的机关改变为中国人的机关，从而也使教会所举办的事业不再是服务于帝国主义利益的事业。这个运动的成功，将使中国的基督教获得新的生命，改变中国人民对于基督教的观感，因为他们使自己的宗教活动和帝国主义侵略中国的活动划清了界线，而不互相混淆。因此，我们相信一千五百多位基督教人士的宣言，不但将为爱国的基督教徒所拥护，而且也将为爱国的天主教徒所响应。一切宗教的信徒们都可以由此得到一个正确的方向，只有朝这个方向走，宗教界才可能建立自己的正常的宗教事业。
