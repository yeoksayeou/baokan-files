　　Striving for Wage Increases and Tax Reductions
    Finnish Workers Strike
    Social Democratic Party's Plot to Obstruct Strike Foiled
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th] Comprehensive TASS report: More than 100,000 Finnish workers have joined the large-scale strike to fight for increased wages, reduced taxes, and improved working and living conditions. The strike was first launched on August 28th among 50,000 metal workers. Subsequently, workers in the telephone and overseas telegraph industries, mine workers, some vehicle repair shop workers, timber industry, and power plant workers also held strikes. The strike is currently expanding and persisting.
    The "Pravda" and "Izvestia" correspondents in Finland, Kiraiynen and Tatdekov, pointed out that the strike was caused by the continuous rise in the price of necessities and increased taxes. The price of food in Finland has increased more than sixteen times compared with pre-war levels, and taxes have increased nearly twenty times. However, the profits of Finnish capitalists have increased year by year, and they have implemented a policy of freezing wages, so the current wages in Finland are about 24 percent lower than the price level.
    Due to the Social Democratic Party's betrayal of the working class, it was not easy to carry out strikes in Finland. However, this large-scale strike shows that no conspiracies or tricks of the Social Democratic Party can stop the workers' growing movement to fight for peace and bread. The Finnish working class is intensifying its struggle against those who follow the orders of the U.S. imperialists and attempt to drag Finland into new war preparations.

　　争取增加工资减少捐税
    芬兰十万工人罢工
    芬社会民主党阻挠罢工阴谋破产
    【新华社十五日讯】综合塔斯社讯：十万以上的芬兰工人，已参加了为争取增加工资、减少捐税、改善工作及生活条件而进行的大罢工。罢工系于八月二十八日在五万名五金工人中首先发动。接着，电话与海外电报业工人、矿坑工人、若干车辆修理场工人、木材工业及电力工场工人等，亦相继举行。罢工现正在扩大并坚持中。
    真理报与消息报驻芬兰记者基拉伊宁和达德科夫指出：罢工是由于必需品不断涨价和捐税增加而引起的，芬兰食品的价格已较战前增加十六倍以上，捐税增加将近二十倍。而芬兰资本家的利润却逐年增加，他们实行冻结工资的政策，因此目前芬兰的工资较物价水平低百分之二十四左右。
    由于社会民主党对工人阶级的叛卖活动，本来在芬兰是不容易进行罢工的，然而这次大罢工表明：社会民主党的任何阴谋诡计，都不能阻止工人们争取和平和面包的日益壮大的运动。芬兰的工人阶级正在加紧斗争，反对那些奉行美帝国主义者的命令而企图把芬兰卷入新战争准备的人们。
