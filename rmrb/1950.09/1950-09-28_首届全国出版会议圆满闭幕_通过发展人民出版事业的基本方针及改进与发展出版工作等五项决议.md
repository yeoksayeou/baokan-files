Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: The first National Publishing Conference convened by the Central People's Government Publishing Administration, lasting eleven days, successfully concluded on September 25th. A total of 321 delegates attended and participated, including representatives from central and regional publishing administrative organs, people's organizations, public and private publishing, printing, distribution industries, magazine publishers, and booksellers from across the country.

At the conference, Hu Yuzhi, Director of the Publishing Administration, delivered a report entitled "On the People's Publishing Undertaking and Its Development Direction," outlining the current situation and basic guidelines for the national publishing industry. (The full text of the report can be found on page 10 of today's newspaper.) The Publishing Administration presented various plans for improving and developing publishing, printing, distribution, and periodicals work. Representatives from various regions submitted 138 proposals. After thorough discussions of Director Hu Yuzhi's report, various plans, and proposals in plenary and group sessions, the entire conference unanimously adopted the basic guidelines for developing the People's Publishing Undertaking and five resolutions on improving and developing publishing work, periodicals work, distribution work, and printing work, as the general guiding principles for the future development of the People's Publishing Undertaking.

Regarding the improvement and development of publishing work, the conference first pointed out that the publishing industry still suffers from significant lack of planning and organization. To overcome this, both public and private publishing houses should strive to create conditions to gradually implement the separation of publishing and distribution, publishing and printing, and the specialization of publishing. Public and private publishing institutions should formulate relatively long-term and time-bound feasible plans to gradually move toward specialization and planning. To support literacy education and cultural and political education for workers, peasants, and soldiers, various popular books and periodicals should be published in large quantities, including spare-time textbooks, political knowledge, production knowledge, scientific knowledge, and literary works, gradually raising standards on the basis of popularization. Regarding royalty methods, the conference believed that they should be decided in consultation with authors, taking into account the interests of authors, readers, and publishers. Regarding reader engagement, the conference believed that publishing houses should establish close ties with reading circles, libraries, the press, and book review publications, listen to opinions in order to correct errors and improve work.

Regarding the improvement and development of book and periodical distribution work, the conference unanimously agreed that business management should be improved, operating expenses reduced, and the prices of books and periodicals gradually lowered, striving for the gradual standardization of book and periodical prices across the country.

After the state-owned Xinhua Bookstore is transformed into an institution specializing in distribution, it should assume the task of consignment sales of publications from all public and private publishing houses in the country. State-owned bookstores should focus on wholesale operations, uniting and organizing all public and private vendors to establish a vast and comprehensive distribution network. Books and periodicals should be delivered to factories, mines, rural areas, troops, government agencies, schools, and areas inhabited by various ethnic minorities in China by various means. At the same time, distribution operations should also be carried out for overseas Chinese and foreign people. State-owned bookstores should interact with private bookstores based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and should pay special attention to small and medium-sized retail booksellers.

Regarding the improvement of periodical work, the conference believed that it should tend towards specialization, be combined with practice, and avoid duplication and waste.

The printing industry currently has overproduction, causing serious unemployment. The conference advocated suggesting to government agencies and organizations that the establishment of new factories or blind expansion should be stopped to maintain existing public and private printing factories, and that methods should be found to provide relief or resettlement for unemployed workers.

Under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the trade union representatives attending the conference decided to establish a preparatory organization to establish a national press, publication and printing trade union in the near future.

The representatives who spoke at the conference unanimously pledged to strive to implement the above policies under the leadership of the Central People's Government Publishing Administration.

The conference also passed a statement opposing American imperialist aggression and a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

On the last day of the conference, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De attended and delivered a speech.

    关于改进和发展出版工作方面，会议首先指出目前出版业中还存在着相当严重的无计划、无组织现象。为克服这种现象，公私出版业均应争取条件，逐步实行出版与发行，出版与印刷分工和出版专业化的方针。公私出版机构均应制定比较长期的和一定期限内的可行的计划，以逐步趋向专业化和计划化。为配合工农兵的识字教育与文化政治教育，应大量出版各种通俗书刊，包括业余课本、政治常识、生产知识、科学知识、文艺作品等，并在普及的基础上逐渐提高。对稿酬办法，会议认为应在兼顾著作家、读者及出版家三方面利益的原则下与著作家协商决定。对读者联系，会议认为出版机关应与读书界、图书馆、新闻界和书评刊物取得密切联系，倾听意见，以便修正错误、改进工作。
    关于改进和发展书刊发行工作方面，会议一致同意应改善企业经营，减少营业费用，使书刊售价逐渐降低，争取全国书刊售价的逐渐划一。
    国营新华书店改为专营发行的机构之后，应负全国公私出版机关出版物的代销任务。国营书店应以批发工作为主，团结并组织一切公私贩卖业，建立广大完密的发行网。用各种方法，把书刊送到工厂、矿山、农村、部队、机关、学校和国内各兄弟民族居住区，同时还应向国外华侨和外国人民开展发行业务。国营书店对私营书店往来应根据平等互惠的原则，并应特别照顾中小零售书商。
    关于改进期刊工作方面，会议认为应趋向分工专业化，结合实际，避免重复浪费。
    印刷业方面目前生产过剩，造成严重失业现象。会议主张向政府机关团体建议，目前停止建立新厂或盲目扩充以维持现有公私营印刷厂，并应设法救济或安置失业工人。
    出席会议的工会代表，在全国总工会领导之下，决定成立筹备机构，以在短期内，建立全国性的新闻出版印刷工会。
