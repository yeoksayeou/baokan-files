Xinhua News Agency, September 7th: The ninety-fourth issue of the *For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy*, the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, published on August 25th, carried an editorial entitled *Stop the Hands of American Fascist Murderers*, stating: It has been two months since the American imperialists openly launched an armed invasion of Korea. During this period, the American ruling class has suffered significant failures in both military and moral-political terms. The American imperialists attempted to seize Korea by means of armed force and bloodshed, but this plan has been defeated by the victorious counter-offensive of the Korean People's Army. Drowning in the sea of the Korean people's anger, the American invaders are constantly retreating southward. MacArthur's soldiers have clearly seen the prospect of complete defeat; they cannot withstand the blows because they are not fighting for a sacred and just cause.

Enraged by the failure of their military adventure, the American interventionists are attempting to strike at the soaring morale of the Korean people with shameless atrocities, lawless terror, and barbaric methods of eliminating peaceful residents. American aircraft are dropping tens of thousands of bombs on cities and villages in Korea, targeting women, children, and the elderly. American warships are wantonly bombarding coastal towns. In a telegram to the Security Council, Park Heon-young, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, described the serious destruction caused by American bombing of Pyongyang and Seoul, the complete destruction of Hungnam, and the heavy casualties among peaceful residents. War criminal MacArthur, with a shameless attitude that makes the arrogance of Goering and Goebbels pale in comparison, daily publicizes how many bombs his "flying fortresses" have dropped, even expressing "regret" for "not being able" to specify the number of targets destroyed and unable to estimate the extent of the destruction!

The ground forces of the American invaders who have set foot on Korean soil are no less barbaric and cruel than the air and sea bandits. Fleeing under the blows of the People's Army, American ground forces destroyed or burned cities and villages, kidnapped or killed all peaceful residents, and shot large numbers of political prisoners. The American and Syngman Rhee troops massacred as many as 7,000 Korean patriots in Langmu Village (transliteration), located near the main highway of Daejeon, an atrocity that has shocked the whole world. There, the largest mass grave was more than 200 meters long, 4 meters wide, and 2 meters deep, filled with the bodies of Korean patriots. In the small city of Pyeongtaek, with a population of only 20,000, 3,030 men, women, and children were killed. War criminals will never escape the palms of revenge of the people of the world!

An American officer, after a certain massacre, said to a reporter from the *New York Herald Tribune*: "Call us the Murder Company!" (See *New York Herald Tribune*, August 10, 1950). This describes not only his company but also all the bloody bandits driven by American imperialism to fight against peace-loving people. These "fighters for Western democracy" are, in fact, insane fascists! They are insatiable aggressors! The heinous atrocities of the American interventionists in Korea have revealed to the whole world that American imperialism is the vicious enemy of all peace-loving people.

The purpose of American imperialism is to plunder the entire Korean peninsula, enslave the Korean people, and ultimately establish a war base on the Asian continent in order to carry out aggression against the Soviet Union, People's China, and the people of Southeast Asian colonies who are fighting for liberation. At the same time, the American rulers hope to use the war adventure in Korea to stir up war hysteria throughout the world in order to accelerate war preparations and ease the growing economic crisis. The governments of the United States and its vassal states are using the Korean war provocation as an excuse to further expand frenzied military preparations, accelerate the fascization of the rear, and finally stifle the remaining democratic freedoms, and launch a campaign of terror to destroy democratic organizations and newspapers. The assassination of Comrade Lahaut, Chairman of the Belgian Communist Party, is one example. Therefore, the purpose of the imperialists' bombing of Pyongyang, Seoul, and other cities in Korea is not only to eliminate the resistance of the Korean people but also to threaten the people of the world and paralyze their anti-imperialist struggle. The bombs dropped on Korean civilians are aimed at the working people of the world and all peace fighters.

The people of the world unanimously demand that the fascist executioners end their heinous crimes. International democratic organizations such as the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace and the people of many countries have asked the United Nations to immediately stop the American aggression against Korea and withdraw all foreign troops from Korea.

The people of the world are intensifying the peace movement. The heroic Korean people are writing an immortal and glorious page every day, inspiring the people of the world. In the two months of American aggression against Korea, the number of people signing the peace declaration has increased by more than 150 million, reaching a total of 336 million. The great peace fighters are building a larger, better organized, and stronger front that will guarantee the defeat of the aggressors, punish the war criminals, and ensure the victory of the cause of peace throughout the world.

### 《争取持久和平，争取人民民主》社论号召  制止美国法西斯杀人犯的手  战犯们决逃不出全世界人民复仇的手掌！

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主》社论号召
     制止美国法西斯杀人犯的手
     战犯们决逃不出全世界人民复仇的手掌！
    【新华社七日讯】八月二十五日出版的共产党与工人党情报局机关刊物《争取持久和平，争取人民民主》第九十四期，以《制止美国法西斯杀人犯的手》为题发表社论称：自从美帝国主义者公开武装侵略朝鲜以来，到现在已经两个月了。在这期间，美国的统治阶级在军事与道义——政治方面，都遭到了重大的失败。美帝国主义者企图用武装与流血的办法霸占朝鲜，但是这一计划已被朝鲜人民军的胜利反攻所击败。淹没在朝鲜人民愤怒的大海中的美国侵略者，不断向南溃退。麦克阿瑟的士兵已清楚看到彻底溃败的前途，他们经不起打击，因为他们不是为神圣和正义的事业而战。
    因为军事冒险的失败而老羞成怒的美国干涉分子，正以无耻的暴行，无法无天的恐怖手段和野蛮消灭和平居民的方法，企图打击朝鲜人民激昂的士气。美国飞机在朝鲜的城市与乡村对妇孺老人投掷着成千成万枚炸弹。美国军舰对沿海一带的城镇大肆轰击。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永在致安全理事会的电文中，叙述了美机轰炸平壤与汉城时所造成的严重破坏，兴南的完全破坏以及和平居民的重大伤亡。战犯麦克阿瑟以使戈林与戈培尔的狂妄都为之暗然失色的无耻态度，每天大肆宣传他的“飞行堡垒”投了多少炸弹，竟然对于“不能”说明被破坏目标的多寡，不能估计破坏的程度而表示“遗憾”！
    踏上朝鲜土地的美国侵略者的地面部队，在野蛮残暴的程度上并不逊于空中与海上的强盗。在人民军的打击下逃跑的美国地面部队，炸毁或焚毁城市与村庄，掳走或杀死所有的和平居民并枪杀大批政治犯。美国与李承晚军队在位于大田主要公路附近的郎武村（译音）中，竟屠杀朝鲜爱国者七千名之多，这一暴行已使整个世界为之震惊。在那儿，一个最大的杀人坑有二百多公尺长、四公尺宽、二公尺深，里面填满了朝鲜爱国者的尸体。在人口仅二万的小城市平泽一地，被杀的男女老小达三千零三十名。战犯们决不能逃出全世界人民复仇的手掌！
    一个美国军官在某次大屠杀以后向纽约先驱论坛报的记者说：“把我们叫作杀人连吧！”（见一九五○年八月十日纽约先驱论坛报。）这不仅说明了他这一连，而且也说明了被美国帝国主义驱使来与爱好和平人民作战的全部血腥的匪徒。这些“西方民主的斗士”原来就是疯狂成性的法西斯分子！就是贪欲无厌的侵略者！美国干涉分子在朝鲜的罪大恶极的暴行，已在全世界面前揭露了美帝国主义是全体爱好和平人们的穷凶极恶的敌人。
    美帝国主义的目的在于掠夺整个朝鲜，奴役朝鲜人民，最后在亚洲大陆建立一个战争基地，以便对苏联、人民中国以及正在为争取解放而斗争的东南亚殖民地人民进行侵略。同时，美国统治者希望利用在朝鲜的战争冒险在全世界煽起战争歇斯底里，以加速战争准备，使正在增长中的经济危机得以和缓。美国和臣属于美国的国家的政府，正在利用朝鲜的战争挑衅作为借口，进一步地扩展狂热的军事准备，加速后方的法西斯化，最后扼杀残存的民主自由，并且发动摧残民主组织和报纸的恐怖运动。比利时共产党主席拉豪特同志的被暗杀就是一个例子。因此，帝国主义者对平壤、汉城以及朝鲜的其他城市施行轰炸的目的，不仅在于消灭朝鲜人民的抵抗，而且是，要威胁全世界人民并瘫痪他们的反帝国主义的斗争。投向朝鲜平民的炸弹，是以全世界的劳动人民和所有和平斗士为对象的。
    全世界人民一致要求法西斯刽子手终止他们的滔天罪行。世界拥护和平大会常设委员会等国际民主团体和许多国家的人民已向联合国要求立即制止美国侵略朝鲜，并自朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。
    全世界人民正在加紧着和平运动。英勇的朝鲜人民每天都在写着不朽光辉的一页，鼓舞着全世界的人民。在美国侵略朝鲜的两个月中，在和平宣言上签名的人数增加了一亿五千万以上，总数已达到三亿三千六百万人。伟大的和平斗士正在建立一条规模更大、组织更好、力量更强的阵线，这条阵线将保证击败侵略者，惩办战争罪犯，并保证全世界和平事业的胜利。
