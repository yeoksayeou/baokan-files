　　Great Achievements of Mass Education in Vietnam Over the Past Five Years
    ——"Voice of Vietnam" Commentary
    Under the rule of the French colonial authorities, 95% of the Vietnamese people were illiterate. Only six days after its establishment, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam called on the Vietnamese people to launch a nationwide campaign to eliminate illiteracy. This movement encountered many seemingly insurmountable difficulties at the time, such as a lack of teachers, funding, and teaching equipment, the dispersion of rural villages, and other difficulties arising from the war of aggression launched by the French imperialists. However, due to the tremendous efforts of the masses and the government, these difficulties were overcome. Wooden planks, doors, and mud floors were used instead of blackboards; bamboo shoots and banana leaves were used instead of paper. Outdoor classes became common, and any village inn, large house, or official residence could quickly be turned into a literacy class, where teachers and students of all ages, men and women, diligently scratched letters on the ground with bamboo shoots.
    Literacy classes were established throughout the country, even in the most remote villages. The number of people volunteering as teachers also increased. From 1945 to 1949, 11.5 million people learned to read and write, nine times more than during the French colonial period. By the end of 1949, illiteracy had been eliminated in ten provinces, fifty-four districts, and nearly five thousand villages.

　　五年来越南群众教育的伟大成就
    ——《越南之声》评论
    在法国殖民者当局统治之下，越南人民不识字的有百分之九十五。越南民主共和国政府在刚刚成立后六天，即号召越南人民发动一个扫除文盲的全国性运动。这个运动在当时遭遇到许多似乎是无法克服的困难，如师资、经费和教学设备的缺乏，农村村落的分散，和由法国帝国主义者所发动的侵略战争所产生的其他困难。但由于广大群众和政府方面所作的巨大努力，这些困难都被克服了。木板床、门板、泥地被用来代替黑板；竹笋彀和芭蕉叶用来代替纸。户外上课成了普通的现象，而任何一个乡村旅店、大房子或官邸，都可迅速变为识字班的课堂，在那里，教师和男女老少的学生们，都紧张地用竹笋尖在地上划着字母。
    消灭文盲班在全国甚至最偏僻的乡村里，纷纷建立起来。自动担任义务教师的人也越来越多。从一九四五年到一九四九年，已有一千一百五十万人学会读书和写字，这比法国殖民者统治时期增加九倍。到一九四九年底，有十个省、五十四个区和将近五千个村庄的文盲，已经被扫除。
