　　Tangshan Railway Factory Excessive Overtime

    Production Plummets, Illnesses Soar

    Factory Leaders Should Pay Close Attention, Quickly Inspect and Rectify

    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Tangshan Railway Factory's unrestricted overtime and lack of attention to rationalization proposals have caused a sharp decline in production. In the past, the factory achieved great results in production competitions, completing 200% of the Ministry-set locomotive task in May. As a result, it exceeded the Ministry's production target for the first half of the year in just five months. However, after Red May, production began to fall: the Ministry's target was not met in June (in the report to the Factory Affairs Bureau, it was stated that the task was completed, but in fact, several repaired vehicles required rework, occupying time in July); production fell even more sharply in July, completing only 49% of the Ministry's locomotive task. Why did the factory's output rise so high in May, and then fall so low in June and especially July?

    There are two main reasons why the factory exceeded production in May: First, the rationalization proposal campaign and new record movement, which began in March, reached a climax in May, improving some machines and tools, improving some working methods, and shortening working hours; second, a large amount of overtime was implemented, increasing the labor of employees. This enabled the factory to complete six months' worth of tasks in five months.

    The factory administration and trade union have an insufficient understanding of the reasons for the above-mentioned over-fulfillment of tasks. First of all, they did not clearly recognize that overtime is not only not a fundamental method for improving production, but will also damage the health of employees and seriously affect production. The factory's locomotive workshop has a total of 376 workers, with approximately 1,800 overtime hours in May. The crosshead repair group, with 13 workers, worked a total of 77 overtime hours in May. Among them, three people worked seven overtime shifts each, equivalent to 56 hours, and three others worked eight overtime shifts, equivalent to 64 hours each. According to worker reports, each person worked at least five overtime shifts and at most eleven overtime shifts in May. According to Locomotive Workshop Clerk Li, workers were not sleeping for three days and three nights. The labor protection committee member of the boiler factory said that Liu Baoshun went home at 12 o'clock at night for half a month in May. Due to excessive overtime in May, the number of illnesses among factory workers increased alarmingly. There were 552 sick workers in May, which increased to 950 in June, and 1,050 took sick leave in July, with sick leave alone reducing 6,527 work hours. The factory has more than 4,800 people, and as many as 5,252 visits to the hospital were made in one month. With such a large amount of damage to the labor force, production efficiency naturally declined. This is the main reason for not completing the task.

    However, is it necessary to adopt unlimited overtime to complete the Ministry of Railways' task? According to the investigation, the locomotive workshop completed two locomotives in early May, six in mid-May, and twenty-three in late May. This fact shows that if the factory leaders can plan the work carefully in advance, the work of each workshop can be closely coordinated, and the raw materials and tools are prepared sufficiently to overcome the phenomenon of being loose first and then tight, it is possible to strive to complete the task within working hours without the need for overtime.

    Disregarding Rationalization Proposals and Improper Handling of Bonuses

    Secondly, the factory does not pay attention to the rationalization proposal movement, and the handling of bonuses for rationalization proposals is very inappropriate, which has prevented the rationalization proposal movement from developing fully. This is also an important reason for the sharp decline in productivity. The factory's rationalization proposal movement started in early March, and by the end of June, a total of 223 rationalization proposals (including inventions, technical improvements, and other improvements in production work, etc.) had been received, of which 157 had been adopted by the administration and 46 had been implemented. However, until now, the official bonus for the rationalization proposal movement has not been issued, and the employees who put forward the rationalization proposals have only been praised on the blackboard newspaper and the honor roll. Many rationalization proposers who have made significant contributions to production have only received a little bonus as labor models in the new record movement, but this little bonus is not commensurate with the value of their contribution. For example, Sun Lianwang, a special labor model of the factory, improved the diesel copper furnace, which greatly improved production efficiency. Originally, it took three and a half hours and one kilogram of diesel to melt twelve kilograms of copper. Now, it only takes one hour and one kilogram of diesel to melt twelve kilograms of copper. It is estimated that just in terms of materials, more than 200 million yuan can be saved each year. With such great achievements, the administration has only given him a reward of more than 400 kilograms of millet. Minister Teng of the Ministry of Railways also pointed out during his inspection of the factory that the reward was too small and should be supplemented, but this has never attracted the attention of the factory's administrative leaders.

    Again, in July, the Ministry of Railways' Factory Affairs Bureau failed to deliver the vehicles that needed to be repaired to the factory in a timely manner, which also affected the completion of the production task in July. In addition, during the production competition in May, in order to pursue quantity, the easy-to-repair locomotives were selected for repair, and even other locomotives were disassembled in a mess, which increased the difficulty of repair in June and July.

    At present, the factory has an insufficient understanding of the above reasons and has not conducted a deep review, which is a great obstacle to future work.

    Editor's Note: Guiding workers' enthusiasm for production to reforming unreasonable production systems and labor organizations, and improving tools and operating methods through production competitions and rationalization proposals is the fundamental direction for improving production. This requires leading cadres of factories and enterprises to establish a long-term perspective of production and construction, value the wisdom and creativity of workers, and protect their health; when formulating and implementing production plans, they must carefully consider labor conditions and production capacity, overcome the subjective point of view of pure tasks, and strictly prohibit rush competitions with overtime.

    Due material rewards should be given to workers' rationalization proposals and inventions in accordance with the principle of benefiting both the public and the private. Only in this way can we consolidate and promote workers' enthusiasm for production and continuously improve production.

　　唐山铁路工厂过度加班加点
    生产骤然下降病员大增
    该厂领导应予以高度重视迅速加以检查纠正
    【本报讯】唐山铁路工厂无限制加班加点，不重视合理化建议，使得生产骤然下降。该厂在过去开展生产竞赛运动中曾获得很大成绩，五月份完成部定机车任务百分之二百，因而在今年五个月中，就超额完成了上半年部定生产任务。但红五月过去以后，产量开始下落：六月份就没有完成部定任务（在给厂务局的报告中说是完成了任务，实际上还有几辆修好的车因为反工，占用了七月份的时间）；七月份生产下降更厉害，仅仅完成了部定机车任务的百分之四十九。该厂为什么五月份产量上升得那么高，而六月份，尤其是七月份却又降得如此低？
    该厂五月份超额完成生产的主要原因有二：第一，从三月份开始展开合理化建议运动及新纪录运动，到五月份达到高潮，改进了一些机器和工具，改善了一些工作方法，缩短了工时；第二、大量进行加班加点，增加员工劳动力。因此使该厂五个月完成了六个月的任务。
    该厂行政和工会对以上超额完成任务的原因认识不足，首先是他们没有明确认识到加班加点不仅不是提高生产的基本方法，反而会使员工身体遭受损害，严重影响生产。该厂机车场共有工人三七六人，五月份共加班约一千八百工，十字头修理组十三个工人，在五月份一个月内就加班了七十七个工，其中有三个人每人加班七个工折合五十六小时，还有三个人加班八个工，折合每人加班六十四小时。据工友反映，五月份内每人加班少者五工，多者十一工。机车厂李工务员说，工人们有三天三夜不睡觉的。制炉厂劳保委员说，刘宝顺在五月份有半个月都在夜间十二点回家。由于五月份过度加班加点，该厂工人疾病数目惊人增加。五月份计有五百五十二个病号，六月份就增加到九百五十人，七月份就有一千零五十人请病假，光病假就减去了六千五百二十七个工。该厂共四千八百多人，而一个月内往医院看病的竟达五千二百五十二次。劳动力受到这样大量的损害，生产效率自然低落。这是完不成任务的主要原因。
    但在该厂完成铁道部任务中，是不是必需采取无限制的加班加点的办法呢？根据调查，该厂机车场五月份上旬完成二台机车，中旬完成六台，下旬完成二十三台。这一事实说明：该厂领导上事先如能周密计划工作，各场工作紧密配合，以及原料和工具准备充足，克服先松后紧的现象，是可以争取在工作时间内完成任务，不需要加班加点的。
  轻视合理化建议处理奖金不妥当
    其次，该厂对于合理化建议运动不加重视，处理合理化建议的奖金非常不当，遂使合理化建议运动未得充分发展，这也是使生产率骤然下降的重要原因。该厂合理化建议运动是三月初开始的，到六月底为止，共收到合理化建议（包括发明创造、技术改进及其他生产工作上的改进等）二百二十三件，其中已经行政采纳的有一百五十七件，实行了的有四十六件。但直到现在，合理化建议运动的正式奖金还没有发下，对提出合理化建议的员工只是在黑板报、光荣牌上表扬了一阵。许多对生产有重大贡献的合理化建议者，仅在新纪录运动中当做劳模得到了一点奖金，但这点奖金和他们所贡献的价值是不相称的。例如该厂的特等劳模孙连旺改进了柴油化铜炉，使生产效率大为提高，原来化出十二公斤铜，要用三个半小时和一公斤柴油，现在化十二公斤铜，只用一小时和一公斤柴油，据估计，单就材料一项来说，每年就可以节省两亿余元。这样大的成绩，行政上先后给他的奖金仅四百多斤小米。铁道部滕部长到该厂视察时也曾指出奖得太少，应当补加，但是始终没有引起该厂行政领导上的注意。
    再次，七月份，铁道部厂务局未能及时将需要修理的车辆送到该厂，这也影响了七月份生产任务的完成。加之五月份生产竞赛时，为了追求数量，挑选好修的机车修理，甚至把别的机车拆的一塌糊涂，故增加了六、七月修理时的困难。
    目前该厂对于以上原因，尚认识不足，未作深刻检讨，这对于今后工作是有很大妨碍的。
    （任有才、王志敏）
    编者按：通过生产竞赛和合理化建议，把工人的生产积极性引导到改革不合理的生产制度和劳动组织，改进工具和操作方法上去，这才是提高生产的基本方向。这就要求工厂、企业的领导干部应树立长期的生产建设观点，重视工人的智慧和创造，保护工人健康；在制订和执行生产计划时，必须周密的考虑劳动条件和生产能力，克服主观主义的单纯任务观点，严格制止加班加点的突击竞赛。
    对于工人的合理化建议和创造发明，应根据公私两利的原则，给予应得的合理的物质奖励。只有这样，才能巩固和发扬工人的生产积极性，才能使生产不断提高。
