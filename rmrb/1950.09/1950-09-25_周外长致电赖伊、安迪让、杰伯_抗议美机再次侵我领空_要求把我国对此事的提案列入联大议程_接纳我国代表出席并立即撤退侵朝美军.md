Xinhua News Agency, 24th: Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, today sent a telegram to Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, regarding the intrusion of military aircraft of the US invading Korean troops into the airspace of the People's Republic of China again and the dropping of 12 bombs in the urban area of Andong, Liaoning Province. He requested that it be forwarded to Mr. Andrijanovsky, President of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and Mr. Jebb, President of the Security Council, to once again severely protest the crime of US military aircraft intruding into China's airspace, killing and wounding Chinese people, and damaging Chinese property. He demanded that the United Nations General Assembly immediately include China's proposal on this matter on the agenda of the General Assembly, accept China's representatives to attend and present their views and participate in discussions; at the same time, he demanded that the United Nations General Assembly immediately take effective measures to sanction the US aggression and withdraw the US invading troops from Korea as soon as possible. The telegram is as follows: Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lake Success, New York, and to be forwarded to Mr. Andrijanovsky, President of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and Mr. Jebb, President of the Security Council:

According to a report from the Northeast People's Government, on September 22, 1950, military aircraft of the US invading Korean troops once again intruded into the airspace of the People's Republic of China, first conducting reconnaissance over Lagu Shao in Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, and then brazenly dropping 12 bombs in the urban area of Andong City, Liaoning Province, resulting in damage to our urban area and injuries to our residents. The situation is more serious than the previous strafing by US aircraft. The facts are as follows: At 22:01 Beijing time on September 22, an aircraft of the US invading Korean troops intruded into the airspace over Lagu Shao in Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, for reconnaissance. After a warning from our local garrison troops, it fled south. On the same day, at 22:15 Beijing time, a B-29 bomber of the US invading Korean troops intruded into the airspace of Andong City from the northeast direction and dropped 12 heavy bombs in the southeast area of Zhen'an Road in Andong City, injuring two people, damaging 28 houses, shattering more than 300 tiles and glass windows, and destroying more than five acres of vegetable gardens. After dropping the bombs, the bomber of the US invading Korean troops flew south over Andong City at 22:19 Beijing time.

The latest crime of the aircraft of the US invading Korean troops proves that the provocative actions of the US invading Korean troops in invading China's airspace are increasing, and it shows that the US determination to expand the Korean War, armed invasion of Taiwan, and further expand the invasion of China is becoming increasingly obvious.

I protested and accused the US invading Korean troops' military aircraft of intruding into Chinese airspace, strafing, killing and wounding Chinese people, and damaging Chinese property three times to the United Nations Security Council on August 27, August 30, and September 10 of this year, and requested that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China send its own delegation to participate in and attend the United Nations Security Council. Under the manipulation of the United States, the majority of the Security Council formally included the complaint of the People's Republic of China on the agenda, but in fact, it refused to allow our representatives to attend, present their views, and participate in discussions. This behavior of the US government shows that on the one hand, it attempts to cover up its aggression with the majority it manipulates in the United Nations, and on the other hand, it fears that our representatives will attend and expose its unspeakable crimes. Under the illegal decision of the majority manipulated by the United States, the United Nations General Assembly has so far ignored the solemn demands of our 475 million people, refused to allow the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate, and allowed the illegal "representatives" of the zombie-like Kuomintang reactionary remnant group, Jiang Tingfu, to be a running dog of the United States in the United Nations. This has actually turned the United Nations into a tool to cover up US aggression against China and expansion of the war. This time, the US invading Korean troops continue to intrude into our airspace and injure our people, proving that the flames of the US expanding Eastern war are burning tighter and tighter. In this case, if the representatives of the majority of countries attending the United Nations General Assembly continue to be manipulated by the United States and continue to turn a deaf ear to this US aggression, they cannot escape the responsibility of sharing the responsibility for igniting the Eastern war. Peace-loving people all over the world must not stand idly by.

I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, once again accuse the United Nations of this act of aggression by the United States, and demand that the United Nations General Assembly immediately include the proposal of the People's Republic of China accusing the US invading Korean troops' military aircraft of intruding into our airspace, wantonly strafing and bombing, killing and wounding our people, and damaging our property on the agenda of the General Assembly, and accept our representatives to attend and present their views and participate in discussions. The United Nations General Assembly should immediately recommend that the United Nations Security Council take effective measures to sanction the US aggression and withdraw the US invading troops from Korea as soon as possible to restore peace in the Far East and the world.
                                    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
                                    September 24, 1950, in Beijing

　　周外长致电赖伊、安迪让、杰伯
    抗议美机再次侵我领空
    要求把我国对此事的提案列入联大议程
    接纳我国代表出席并立即撤退侵朝美军
    【新华社二十四日讯】我中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来今日就美国侵朝军队的军用飞机再次侵入我中华人民共和国领土上空、在我辽东省安东市区投弹十二枚事，致电联合国秘书长赖伊先生，并请其转致联合国第五届大会主席安迪让先生及安全理事会主席杰伯先生，再次严重抗议美国军用飞机侵我领空，杀伤我国人民，损坏我国财产的罪行，要求联合国大会立即将我国对此事的提案列入大会议事日程，接纳我国代表出席陈述意见和参加讨论；同时，要求联合国大会立即采取有效办法，制裁美国侵略罪行，并从速撤退美国在朝鲜的侵略军队。电文如下：纽约成功湖联合国秘书长赖伊先生并转联合国第五届大会主席安迪让先生及安全理事会主席杰伯先生：
    据我东北人民政府报告，一九五○年九月二十二日美国侵略朝鲜军队的军用飞机又侵入我中华人民共和国领土上空，先在我辽东省宽甸县拉古哨上空进行侦察，继在我辽东省安东市市区竟投掷炸弹十二枚，以致毁坏我市区，炸伤我居民，情况较美机前数次的扫射，更为严重。事实经过是九月二十二日北京时间二十二时零一分，侵朝美军的飞机一架侵入我辽东省宽甸县拉古哨上空，进行侦察，当经我当地驻防部队予以警告，始向南逸去。同日，北京时间二十二时十五分，侵朝美军的Ｂ２９式轰炸机一架，由我安东东北方向，侵入安东市上空，向安东市镇安路东南一带投掷重磅炸弹十二枚，炸伤二人，炸坏房屋二十八间，震坏屋瓦玻璃三百多间，炸毁菜园五亩多。该侵朝美军的轰炸机于投弹后在北京时间二十二时十九分经安东市上空向南飞去。
    美国侵朝军队的飞机之又一次的罪行，证明美国侵朝军队之侵犯我国领空的挑衅行动，正在有增无已，并说明美国扩大侵朝战争、武装侵略台湾并更进一步扩大侵略中国的决心，已更加昭然若揭。
    我于本年八月二十七日、八月三十日及九月十日三次向联合国安全理事会抗议并控诉美国侵朝军队军用飞机侵入中国领空，扫射、杀伤中国人民、损坏中国财产的罪行，并要求中华人民共和国中央人民政府派遣自己的代表团参加和出席联合国安全理事会。安全理事会的多数在美国操纵之下，虽然形式上将中华人民共和国的控诉案列入议程，但实际上则拒绝我国代表出席陈述意见和参加讨论。美国政府这种行为，说明了它一方面企图借它在联合国操纵的多数掩盖其侵略暴行，另一方面则又惧怕我国代表出席，揭露其不能见人的罪恶。而联合国大会在美国操纵的多数非法决定之下，迄今仍无视我国四亿七千五百万人民的严正要求，拒绝我中华人民共和国的合法代表参加，并容留僵尸化了的国民党反动残余集团的非法“代表”蒋廷黻在联合国内作美国的走狗，这实际上使联合国沦为掩盖美国侵略中国及扩大战争的工具。这一次美国侵朝军继续侵入我国领空，炸伤我国人民的暴行，证明美国扩大东方战争的火焰已愈烧愈紧。在这种情况下，出席联合国大会的多数国家的代表如仍甘受美国的操纵，继续对于美国这种侵略罪行，装聋作哑，他们就不能逃避分担燃起东方战火的责任。全世界爱好和平的人民，绝不能对此袖手旁观。
    我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府，再一次向联合国控诉美国这一侵略暴行，要求联合国大会立即将我中华人民共和国控诉美国侵朝军队军用飞机侵入我国领空、肆行扫射轰炸、杀伤我国人民并损坏我国财产的提案列入大会议事日程，并接纳我国代表出席陈述意见和参加讨论。联合国大会应立即建议联合国安全理事会采取有效办法，制裁美国侵略罪行，并从速撤退美国在朝鲜的侵略军队，以恢复远东和世界的和平。
            中华人民共和国中央人民政府  外交部部长  周恩来
                              一九五○年九月二十四日于北京
