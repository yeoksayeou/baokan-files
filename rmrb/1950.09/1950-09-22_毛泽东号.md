　　Mao Zedong Locomotive
    (Serialized Novella)
    By Ding Kexin and Qing Ying, Illustrated by Zhuang Yan
    Thirty-Two, Circulate! Run!
    Task after task, experiment after experiment.
    The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" had just finished washing its tanks when the Bureau once again invited the old hero.
    Because of the shortage of locomotives, they wanted to remedy the situation by experimenting with a circular operation system: from the time the locomotive finished washing its tanks to the next time, it would not return to the depot, but would operate in a circular fashion.
    But people thought it wouldn't work, and many even voiced their opposition.
    Director Zhuang said:
    "Now we still need you to experiment. If you can complete the experiment of the new operating system, I believe you will definitely be able to complete the experiment of the circular operation system."
    There were two things that excited the old hero the most: one was the Bureau's high regard and trust in the "Mao Zedong Locomotive"; the other was that his partners on the locomotive took care of his difficulties and did not ask him to share the 400,000 yuan bonus given to the factory.
    On the way back from the Bureau, he thought: how to complete the task even better? How to unite everyone even more closely? How to improve the skills of the young people?
    He keenly felt that in the past he had placed too much emphasis on personal interests and family problems, and that sometimes his attitude towards people and things was not good. He even felt that every young person on the locomotive was stronger than him, and that his care and help for everyone was far from enough. In these many aspects, he needed to learn better from Guo Shude.
    Back home, all the partners were eagerly waiting for him to return. Shang Baoheng, Guo Shude, Zheng Dugong and others shook hands with him warmly, and the rest of the young people surrounded him, as if they wanted to lift him up...
    With tears in his eyes, the old hero told everyone in detail the encouragement and hope that the Bureau had given them.
    Everyone's high spirits were about to explode. Some proposed making a plan and starting immediately; a few considered the difficulties. Everyone said: don't emphasize the difficulties, overcome them.
    The old hero, Guo Shude, and Shang Baoheng discussed it first and then held a careful group meeting again.
    A convention was established at the meeting:
    First, the two shifts will jointly organize the locomotive. The outgoing shift will clean the furnace and apply oil to the upper part, and the incoming shift will ensure that they are not late and will apply oil to the lower part.
    Second, minimize the time spent stopped and depart quickly.
    Third, maintain the quality of the locomotive, avoid wear and tear, and repair minor issues ourselves.
    Fourth, never complain about difficulties, and think of all possible ways to overcome them!
    As soon as they announced it, some people said:
    "The Mao Zedong Locomotive is of good quality, other locomotives may not be able to do it."
    Everyone discussed it again and recommended that the old hero petition the higher authorities to lead Locomotive 1040 to experiment together and help each other.
    The higher authorities approved.
    Shang Baoheng had been waiting anxiously, his eyes red, and seized the opportunity to propose:
    "Let's run the first shift!"
    This was something he, the stoker Hu Chundong, and Wang Qingquan had discussed long ago.
    In February, North Manchuria was still thirty-eight degrees below zero, the weather was really cold!
    But Lao Shang and the others were sweating profusely.
    Other locomotives gave way to them, and did not stop on the road.
    People thought it was still early, and some even worried that Lao Shang's gruffness would cause an accident; but it was really strange, they returned safely and victoriously a lot earlier!
    Someone asked:
    "Chief Shang, please tell me: why are you so fast and don't have accidents?"
    "This," Lao Shang replied, "is not just my doing, it all depends on the stokers refueling, and also on the dispatchers helping."
    "The main control is you, how are you so good at this, you rascal?"
    "I naturally have a part," he didn't laugh, "The most important thing about driving is to stay calm, if you can't stay calm, even if you have the skills, it's useless! It's like fighting a war, if you can't stay calm, you can't shoot accurately, and you'll fire randomly!"
    Lao Shang handed over the shift to Lao Guo, and Lao Guo handed over the shift to the old hero. The locomotive was driven out without returning to the depot, and the people rested while the locomotive didn't!
    Locomotive 1040 followed, working just as hard.
    One trip after another.
    One trip after another!
    Circulate, run, keep running - Locomotive 1040 followed closely.
    The amount of transportation has greatly increased! The difficulty of lacking locomotives has been temporarily resolved! (Only worried about the supply of train cars).
    In the past, it took some locomotives two hours to return to Harbin and leave the depot, and the fastest took 54 minutes.
    The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" arrived at the station to hand over the shift, and after adding coal, water, oil, and cleaning the furnace, it stopped for only a quarter of an hour and then drove away immediately.
    The partners were increasingly fond of the locomotive, and the old hero often came to the station during his off-duty hours to carefully take care of it and help everyone repair it.
    "I don't know why, I have such a deep feeling for the locomotive," said young stoker Hu Chundong, "I feel closer to it than anyone else. Every day after eating, I always go around the locomotive once, whether going to work or coming off work. I can't even rest at home during my off-duty hours, and I unconsciously turn to the station to wait for the locomotive, often asking where the locomotive is? Is it good? It's really uncomfortable if I don't see it for a while!..."
    From February 7th to February 16th, after calculating the accounts:
    In nine days, it traveled a total of more than 4,200 kilometers!
    Calculated by daily locomotive kilometers, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" set a new record in February! (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号
    （中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影  作  庄言  插图
    三十二、循环吧！跑吧！
    任务接着任务，一个试验跟着一个试验。
    “毛泽东号”刚洗罐，管理局又把老英雄请去了。
    因为机车缺，要以试行循环运转制来补救：机车从这次洗罐到下次洗罐，不入库，循环运转。
    可是人们认为行不通，甚至有好多人提出反对。
    庄局长说：
    “现在还要由你们来试验。你们完成了新运行制的试验，我相信也一定能完成循环运转制的试验。”
    老英雄现在有两件事情最使他激动：一件是管理局对“毛泽东号”如此看重，如此信任；再一件是车上的伙伴们照顾他的困难，提给工厂的四十万奖金，没有让他分担。
    从管理局回来的道上，他想：怎样把任务完成得更好？怎样把大家团结得更紧？怎样把青年们的技术提高？
    他痛切地感到：过去自己把个人利益、家庭问题看的太重，对人对事有时态度不好。他甚至觉得：车上哪一个青年都比他强，他对大家的关心和帮助是太不够了。在这许多方面，需要更好的向郭树德学习。
    回到家，全体伙伴正热切地盼望他回来，商宝恒、郭树德、郑笃恭等都亲热地和他握手，其余的青年都团团地围住他，好像要把他抱起来。……
    老英雄含着泪花，把管理局对他们的鼓励和希望向大伙儿详详细细的唠说了一遍。
    大伙儿高涨的情绪就要爆炸一样，有的就提出马上定计划，马上干；个别人考虑到有困难。大家都说：不强调困难，要克服困难。
    老英雄和郭树德、商宝恒先合计了一下，重新慎重的开了小组会。
    会上订出了公约：
    第一，接交两班共同整理机车，交班的清炉，浇上部油，接班的保证不迟到，浇下部油。
    第二，尽量减少停留时间，迅速发车。
    第三，保持机车质量，不磨耗不烧损，小活自己修理。
    第四，有困难绝不叫苦，想一切办法克服它！
    他们一宣布，有些人就说：
    “毛泽东号质量好，别的机车怕不行。”
    大家又合计，推老英雄向上级请求，带领一○四○机车一同试验，互相帮助。
    上级允许了。
    商宝恒早等得红了眼，瞅准机会提出来：
    “咱们跑头班！”
    这是他和司炉胡春东、王清权早已商量好的。
    二月里，北满仍是零下三十八度，天气冷的真够劲！
    可是老商他们身上直淌汗。
    别的车都给他们让路，路上不停车。
    人们以为还早哩，有人还担心老商那样气粗会出事故哩；可是真怪啊，他们提早好多时间安全地胜利地回来了！
    有人问：
    “商大车，请教：为何你们又快又不出事故？”
    “这，”老商答：“不是我一个人的事情，全仗司炉他们加油哪，还靠调度帮忙哪。”
    “主要掌握是你呀，你这兔羔子怎么这样行？”
    “我自然也有一份，”他没有笑：“开车最要紧是沉住气，沉不住气有技术也白搭！比方打仗，不沉住气枪就打不准，乱放一起！”
    老商交班老郭接班，老郭交班老英雄接班，车开出去不回库，人歇车不歇！
    一○四○号跟着，同样紧张地工作着。
    跑一趟，又一趟。
    一趟连一趟！
    循环吧，跑吧，接着跑——一○四○号紧紧地跟着。
    运输量大大增加了！缺少机车的困难暂时解决了！（只愁车皮供应不上）。
    过去机车回到哈尔滨到出库，有的要两个钟头，最快的也要五十四分钟。
    “毛泽东号”到站上交接班，连上煤、上水、给油、清炉，一共停留一刻钟，马上就开走了。
    伙伴们都越来越热爱着机车，老英雄休班时也常到站上来，仔细照看，帮着大家修理。
    “不知怎的，我对机车有那么深的感情，”青年司炉胡春东说：“感到对它比谁也亲。每天吃了饭，总要围着车转一圈，上下班也是如此。在家歇班也歇不住，不知不觉就转到站上等车去了，常常打问车到了哪里？好不好？真是一会儿不见就难受！………”
    从二月七号到十六号，算了算账：
    九天共走行四千二百多公里！
    按日车公里计，二月份“毛泽东号”又创了新纪录！（附图片）
