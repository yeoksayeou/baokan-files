Xinhua News Agency, 18th: North China state-run electric power units have reduced various electricity prices from September 11th and unified the electricity price standards for power and lighting. In total, various electricity prices across the region have been reduced by an average of approximately 8%, with power electricity prices reduced by an average of approximately 10%. The vast majority of regions have reduced electricity prices according to the unified electricity price standard for power and lighting. Only a small number of areas where the original electricity prices were lower than this unified price standard have not been reduced further. This reduction in various electricity prices is the result of various improvements in the operation and management of state-run electric power industries, which have reduced the cost of electricity. The special reduction in power electricity prices further demonstrates the spirit of state-run electric power industries serving production, especially industrial production. In the reduction of various electricity prices, the ratio of power electricity prices to lighting electricity prices has also been appropriately adjusted according to the above spirit. Taking the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid as an example, before the adjustment, the ratio of power electricity to first-level and second-level lighting electricity was 1:1.3 and 1:1.65, respectively. Now, the ratio of power electricity to lighting electricity has reached 1:1.82.

　　华北国营电业减低各种电价
    【新华社十八日讯】华北国营电业单位自九月十一日起减低各种电价，并统一电力与表灯的电价标准。总计全区各地各种电价平均减低约百分之八，其中电力电价平均减低百分之十左右。各地按电力与表灯的统一电价标准减低电价者占绝大多数，仅少数原来电价低于此次统一电价标准之地未再减低。此次各种电价之减低，是由于国营电业经营管理工作多方改进因而使电的成本降低的结果。电力电价之特别减低，更显示出国营电业服务于生产、尤其服务于工业生产的精神。在各种电价减低中电力和电光的电价对比也根据上述精神作了适当调整。以京津唐电力网为例，调整前电力和第一级、第二级电光的对比是一比一点三、一比一点六五，现在电力和电光的对比已达一比一点八二。
