Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 15th: The first phase of the three major state-owned irrigation projects in Chahar Province launched this spring—the Sanggan River First Irrigation Canal, the Hun River Guangji Canal, and the Yu River Canal—has been fully completed. The second phase of the project has now begun and is expected to be completed by the end of this year, expanding the irrigated area to one million mu.

The Sanggan River, Hun River, and Yu River all originate from high altitudes and have rapid flows, carrying a large amount of silt, which causes great harm to the lower reaches. In order to reduce silt in the lower reaches and irrigate the barren land in the areas of Shanyin, Ying County, and Datong, the Chahar Provincial People's Government began planning the construction of the above-mentioned three irrigation canals in September of last year, and construction began in April of this year.

The first phase of the project included the construction of more than 500 li of main and branch canals, 4.4 million cubic meters of earthwork, and the construction of 224 bridges, sluice gates, weirs, aqueducts, and culverts. Thanks to the close cooperation of the People's Governments, the People's Liberation Army, and the local laborers in the respective regions, the first phase of the project has been completed, transforming 470,000 mu of barren and infertile land in the three counties of Shanyin, Ying County, and Datong into fertile fields. It is estimated that the minimum annual increase in millet production will be 180,000 shi. The Guangji Canal began releasing water in August, irrigating more than 20,000 mu of land. The second phase of the project has now started in full swing and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

　　察省淤灌工程第一期完工
    每年可增产小米十八万市石  第二期工程预计年底可完成
    【新华社张家口十五日电】察哈尔省今春举办的桑乾河第一淤灌渠、浑河广济渠及御河渠等三大国营淤灌工程的第一期工程已经全部完工。第二期工程现已开始，预计今年年底可以全部完成，将扩大淤灌面积到一百万亩。桑乾河、浑河及御河均源高流急，冲夹泥沙很多，流至下游危害很大。为了减少下游泥沙和淤灌山阴、应县、大同一带瘠地、察省人民政府乃于去年九月开始筹划修建上述三个淤灌渠道，今年四月即开始施工。第一期工程包括修筑干支渠道五百余华里，土工四百四十万余公方，修建桥梁、闸门、跌水、渡槽及涵洞等二百二十四座。由于各该地区人民政府、人民解放军及当地民工的密切配合，第一期工程已告完成，使山阴、应县、大同等三县四十七万亩荒滩瘠地从此变为沃野良田，估计最低每年可增产小米十八万市石，广济渠已于八月间开始放水，灌地二万余亩。第二期工程现已全面动工，预计年底即可完成。
