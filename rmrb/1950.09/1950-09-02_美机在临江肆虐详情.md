Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st: This reporter's account of the details of the American planes' intrusion into our country's airspace and their atrocities in Linjiang City and Dalizi Station, Liaodong Province, on August 27th, states: On August 27th, the No. 446 guard car, the No. 262 passenger car, and the No. 1147 and No. 928 locomotives, which were damaged by American planes near the Linjiang Station near Jiangqiao, and the No. 268 locomotive damaged at Dalizi Station, were all covered with bullet holes. The No. 928 locomotive alone had 78 bullet holes. The rails of the Linjiang Locomotive Depot, located more than 100 meters from Jiangqiao, had five holes pierced through them. In the operations room, 112 roof tiles and seven panes of glass were shattered by the planes. On the cement floor of the room, there was a pool of reddish-black blood from driver Xu Guochen, whose four fingers on his left hand were shot off by American bullets. Wang Yihong, a resident of Erdaogou, Linjiang County, who was passing in front of Linjiang Station at the time, was also wounded in his left palm by American bullets.
　　
The people of Linjiang clearly saw how the American planes ran amok on Chinese territory. On August 27th, three American P-51 planes and one Mosquito plane made five strafing runs on and near Dalizi Station during an attack at 10:05 AM. The No. 268 locomotive, operated by driver Guo Wenlin, was damaged at Dalizi Station. At 11:04 AM, the four planes, in a formation of three in a row and one on the side, flew low from the direction of Dalizi to the airspace above the station near Jiangqiao, Linjiang. Switchman Liu Xizhang witnessed two American planes facing each other north and south in the air, tilting their fuselages, waving red flags, and then the two planes behind them fiercely shooting at the locomotives parked on the rails next to the locomotive depot. Xing Zhanwen, the operations director, saw the dazzling white star of the U.S. Air Force on the planes outside the operations room. More than a dozen workers lying in the cornfields and low-lying areas on both sides of the railway clearly saw the four American planes taking turns strafing the locomotives and passenger cars from south to north and from north to south. The No. 262 passenger car parked in front of Linjiang Station was hit in twelve places, and two places caught fire. The American planes strafed for eleven minutes and then fled in a southeasterly direction. The burning passenger car was immediately extinguished by the workers.
　　
The people of Linjiang, like the people of the whole country, expressed infinite anger at the provocations and brutal acts of the American Air Force. Driver Xu Guochen, who was wounded in the fierce strafing while bravely rescuing the No. 928 locomotive, demonstrated the iron will of the tens of millions of Chinese people. He said: "Although my left hand is disabled, I can still use my right hand to redouble my work so that I can work with the people of the whole country to crush the aggressive acts of American imperialism."

　　美机在临江肆虐详情
    【新华社沈阳一日电】本社记者报道八月二十七日美国飞机侵入我国领空，在辽东省临江城及大栗子车站肆虐的详情称：八月二十七日，在江桥附近临江车站被美机击坏的四四六号守护车，二六二号客车及一一四七号、九二八号两辆机车，与在大栗子车站被击坏的二六八号机车，车身上都遍布弹伤。仅九二八号机车上即有七十八个弹孔。距江桥百余公尺的临江机务段的铁轨被横穿五个孔。运转室有一百一十二块房瓦及七块玻璃被飞机击碎。在该室的洋灰地上，有被美机打掉左手四个手指头的司机徐国臣的一滩赤黑血迹。家住临江县二道沟的当时行经临江车站前的居民王义宏，则被美国子弹击伤左手掌。
    临江的人民清楚地看见了美机怎样在中国领土上肆虐。八月二十七日美国Ｐ５１飞机三架及蚊式飞机一架，在上午十时另五分的一次侵袭中，在大栗子车站及其附近扫射了五次。司机郭文林操纵着的二六八号机车在大栗子车站被击坏了。十一时另四分，该四架飞机又以三架前后鱼贯、一架在旁的队形，从大栗子方向低飞至临江江桥附近的车站上空。调车员刘锡章目击两架美机在空中南北相对，侧着机身，摆了摆红旗后，后面的两架飞机就向停在机车库旁边铁路上的机车猛烈射击起来。运转主任邢占文在运转室外看见飞机上耀眼的白五星的美国空军标志。十余名卧在铁路两侧玉米地里及地势低洼处的工人清楚的看见这四架美机从南向北、从北向南地轮番扫射机车和客车。停在临江车站前的二六二号客车被击中十二处，两处燃烧起来。美机扫射十一分钟后，即向东南方向逸去。着火的客车立即被工人救息了。
    临江人民和全国人民一样对美国空军的挑衅和残暴行为表示无限的愤怒。在美机疯狂扫射中因奋勇抢救九二八号机车而被击伤的司机徐国臣，表现了千千万万中国人民的钢铁意志。他说：“我虽然左手残废了，但仍可用右手来加倍工作，以便与全国人民一道，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略行为。”
