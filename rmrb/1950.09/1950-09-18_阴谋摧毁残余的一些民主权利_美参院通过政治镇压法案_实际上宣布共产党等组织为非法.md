　　Conspiracy to Destroy Remaining Democratic Rights
    US Senate Passes Political Repression Bill
    Effectively Outlawing Communist Party and Other Organizations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 17th] TASS, Washington, 15th: The US House of Representatives and Senate have recently passed fascist bills that effectively outlaw the Communist Party and various progressive groups. Sources reveal that, under the pretext of defending "American democracy," Democratic and Republican members of Congress are plotting to deliver a devastating blow to the remaining democratic rights in the United States.
    The bill passed by the Senate attempts to outlaw the Communist Party and other progressive organizations through various forms of harassment and persecution, including a system requiring party members to register. The bill stipulates that anyone who is determined by a court to have "actually assisted a foreign-controlled dictatorial institution" shall be sentenced to ten years in prison. Under this vague provision, reactionary US courts can use "trials" of the Foley Square (referring to the trial of US Communist Party leaders - translator's note) type to throw any anti-war and anti-fascist fighter into prison. The bill also stipulates that the Communist Party and other organizations deemed "subversive" by the Attorney General must submit lists of their members and regular financial reports. The bill also prohibits issuing passports to members of "Communist" organizations. The bill provides for the establishment of a "Subversive Activities Control Board," which has unprecedented power to decide what organizations and individuals should be included on the "subversive" list. The bill also authorizes the Attorney General to arrest anyone "likely to conspire in espionage and sabotage" during a "domestic security emergency." The bill also provides for severe imprisonment for people who march or demonstrate outside federal courts.
    Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, issued a statement to the press comparing the Senate bill to the legislation enacted by Hitler in 1933 to "legalize" his reign of terror. Dennis said: The stench of crematoria and incinerators hangs over the Senate Chamber. However, with prompt and resolute action, the American people can still stop the fascist tide and reject the tragic fate that the Nazi bandits once inflicted on the German people.

　　阴谋摧毁残余的一些民主权利
    美参院通过政治镇压法案
    实际上宣布共产党等组织为非法
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十五日电：美国众院及参院新近先后通过了实际上宣布共产党与各种进步团体为非法的法西斯化法案。消息揭露，民主党和共和党议员借口保卫“美国的民主”，阴谋对美国残余的一些民主权利施以毁灭性的打击。
    参院通过的法案企图以种种找麻烦及迫害——包括要求党员登记的制度来宣布共产党及其他进步组织为非法。该法案规定，凡经法庭决定“曾实际帮助过外国控制的独裁机构”的人，应处以十年有期徒刑。根据这条含混的条款，美国的反动法庭可以利用福莱广场（美反动法庭审判美共领袖处——译注）式的“审判”，将任何反战反法西斯的战士投入监狱。法案又规定，共产党及凡经司法部长认为是“阴谋破坏性的”其他组织须交出其成员名单和定期的财政报告。法案还禁止发护照给“共产党”组织的成员。法案规定设立“阴谋破坏活动管制委员会”，该委员会具有史无前例的权力，可以决定什么组织及个人须列入“阴谋破坏”名单。法案又授权司法部长在“国内安全紧急状态”时得逮捕任何“可能阴谋进行间谍活动及破坏行为”的人。法案并规定对于在联邦法院外游行示威的人处以严厉的徒刑。
    美国共产党全国委员会书记霍尔曾向报界发表声明，他把参议院的法案和希特勒为了使得他的恐怖统治“合法化”而在一九三三年所采取的立法案相比。霍尔说：化尸炉和火葬场的恶臭笼罩着参议院大厅。可是，只要迅速和坚决地行动起来，美国人民还来得及阻止法西斯潮流并且拒绝曾为纳粹匪徒所曾加诸德国人民的悲惨命运。
