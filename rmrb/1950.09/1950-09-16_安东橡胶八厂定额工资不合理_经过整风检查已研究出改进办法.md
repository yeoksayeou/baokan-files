　　Unreasonable Piece-Rate Wages at Andong Rubber Factory No. 8
	Improvement Measures Studied After Rectification Check
    [Our Andong Dispatch] At the rectification meeting, Andong Rubber Factory No. 8 reflected the serious unreasonableness of the piece-rate wage system, which hindered workers' production enthusiasm and affected the improvement of production and quality.

    The factory's quotas fluctuated greatly, and were revised five times in the past six months, but were never reasonably resolved. The impact on wages was not based on the principle of "to each according to his work," but rather on uneven distribution of hardship and ease. For example, the basic wage for toe-pasting workers (Grade 4) in the shaping workshop is 150 points, but the actual average wage per person is only 94.80 points. The basic points for middle-layer pasting workers (Grade 6) is 110 points, but the actual average wage per person is as high as 165.80 points. That is to say, Grade 4 toe-pasting workers can only get 63.2 percent of their basic wage, while Grade 6 middle-layer pasting workers' wages exceed their basic wage by 50.70 percent. The shaping and shoe upper making work are all light manual labor production, and some wages are above 220 points, but the wages of the most important workshop—the rubber mixing workshop workers (daily wage) are not even 173 points at the highest, the disparity is too great. Due to the failure to set a relatively reasonable quota for the past six months, workers have not received the wages they deserve for a "long time," and their enthusiasm for production has declined.

    The reasons for this phenomenon are, first of all, the lack of understanding of quotas by leading cadres. When the quota system was first introduced in February of this year, leading cadres did not even understand what a "quota" was. The documents issued by the higher authorities clearly pointed out that the quota should be between the new records achieved by advanced producers and the existing technical standards, and should be a standard that can be achieved by general workers under normal and active working conditions. However, the leaders of the factory thought that only a few people should reach the "quota." Under the circumstances that the leaders' thoughts were not clear and the understanding of the significance of the quota was inconsistent, the Labor-Management Committee was convened to set the quota. At the meeting, the factory director bargained with the workers, and as a result, in order to set the quota "quickly," no thorough plan was made, and a simple order was issued to "report to the bureau after finishing it in three days."

    Secondly, the wage department lacked specific technical guidance on quota setting, and the leadership did not provide enough help to their work. Therefore, the quota setters did not work seriously, resulting in some unreasonable quotas. For example, when setting quotas for toe-pasting (without moving the shoes) in Factory No. 1 and toe-pasting (with moving the shoes) in Factory No. 2, the time for moving the shoes was not removed; in addition, when the operation method or other conditions changed, the quota was not modified accordingly, resulting in many unreasonable quotas. This shows that the wage department has a work style of not going deep into the grassroots, not providing specific leadership, not analyzing and studying, and being careless.

    Thirdly, the quota work did not adopt the method of combining leadership and the masses. The Northeast Industrial Department clearly pointed out that "the quota must be discussed with the workers," but the factory did not conduct quota propaganda and education among the workers. Not only did the vast majority of workers not understand, but even a few leading cadres were not clear about "where to find the quota." Individual main leading cadres were still very vague until the rectification began (early August). Therefore, the quotas made were not in line with reality.

    Fourthly, the leadership one-sidedly emphasized completing or exceeding the task, believing that the quota should always follow efficiency. Of course, the realization of a reasonable quota will stimulate the workers' enthusiasm for labor, and thus promote the improvement of productivity; when efficiency improves, the quota will also be changed according to the increase in efficiency. However, the quota should not "always" follow efficiency. For example, the original quota for the four processes of upper sole shaping, cloth sticking printing, edge trimming, and oil brushing in the shaping workshop was 750 pairs. Because efficiency improved (the highest output reached 980 pairs), the quota was changed to 900 pairs accordingly. In this way, it is difficult for workers to get the basic wage they deserve, let alone an excess award, which affects workers' production enthusiasm.

    During the rectification, the wage department was responsible for conducting research and putting forward opinions. After preliminary discussion, it was decided to start improving the work from the following aspects:

    1. Leading cadres should carefully study the quota policy, overcome the work style of simplifying the quota work, go deep into the workshop, discover problems, study problems, solve problems, and overcome the past problem of sitting in the office and being busy with affairs.

    2. Strengthen the quota setting work, first carry out ideological education for the quota setters, strengthen their sense of responsibility, improve their interest in the business, and improve the quota setting methods to make the quota setting scientific and reasonable.

    3. The Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League should closely cooperate to strengthen the quota education of workers and the business education of staff cadres, especially the relevant departments should be proficient in the quota work. In the future, the revision of quotas must be carefully calculated and discussed by the masses.

    4. The wage disparity caused by unreasonable quotas should be remedied according to the actual situation. The new quota will be implemented from September to gradually make the wages reasonable.

### 安东橡胶八厂定额工资不合理  经过整风检查已研究出改进办法

　　安东橡胶八厂定额工资不合理
    经过整风检查已研究出改进办法
    【本报安东讯】安东橡胶第八厂在整风会议上反映出定额工资存在着严重不合理现象，妨碍工人生产情绪，影响生产及质量的提高。
    该厂定额忽高忽低，半年来修改了五次，终未合理解决，影响工资也不是按劳取酬，而是苦乐不均。例如：成型间打揎工人（四级）基本工资为一五○分，而实际工资每人平均分数仅九四·八○分，刷中的工人（六级）基本分为一一○分，但实际工资每人平均竟达一六五·八○分，这就是说打揎四级工人只能得到基本工资的百分之六三·二，而刷中的六级工人的工资却超过了基本工资百分之五○·七○，成型和制帮工作全部是轻体力手工业性质的生产，有的工资在二二○分以上，可是最重要的车间——制胶间工友的工资（日工）最高者不到一七三分，悬殊过大。由于半年来没有定出比较合理的定额，工人“长期”得不到应得的工资，生产积极性下降了。
    造成这种现象的原因，首先是领导干部对定额的认识不足。在今年二月开始搞定额时，领导干部连什么叫“定额”都不明了，上级发的文件已明确指出：定额应介乎先进生产者所达到的新纪录，和现在自然存在的技术标准之间，为一般职工正常积极工作条件下都能达到的标准。但该厂领导思想上则认为达到“定额”的人应占很少数。在领导思想不明确，对定额意义认识不一致的情况下，就召开了工管会来定定额，在会上形成厂长与工友讨价还价，结果为了“快”定出定额，不作周密计划，而简单的命令“三天定完报局”。
    其次，是工薪科对标定员缺乏具体的技术指导，领导上对其工作帮助不够，因之标定员工作不认真，造成某些定额的不合理。例如一厂打揎（不搬揎）与二厂打揎（搬揎）的标定，未将搬揎时间去掉；另外操作方法或其他条件改变时，定额不随之修改，而造成许多定额不合理现象。这说明工薪科工作上存在着不深入下层，不具体领导、不分析研究、粗枝大叶的工作作风。
    第三是定额工作没有采取领导和群众相结合的办法。东北工业部曾明确指出“定额一定要和工人群众商量”，但该厂在职工中没有进行定额的宣传教育，不但广大的工友不明白，就是连少数领导干部也弄不清楚“定额从何处找”，个别的主要领导干部到整风开始（八月上旬）还非常模糊。因此所作出的定额不合实际。
    第四、是领导思想上片面的强调了完成任务或超过任务，认为定额应该时刻跟着效率跑。当然合理定额的实现，将刺激工友劳动热忱，因而也促进了生产率的提高；效率提高了定额也根据效率的增进而改变。但是定额不应“时刻”跟着效率跑，例如该厂成型间上底和贴布印、元边、刷油这四个过程原定额均为七五○双，因效率提高（产量最高达到九八○双）所以定额随着改为九○○双，这样工人则很难得到应得的基本工资，更谈不上超额奖励，影响工人生产情绪。
    在整风中，由工薪科负责进行了研究，提出意见，经过初步的讨论，并决定从以下几方面着手改进工作：
    一、领导干部应仔细研究定额政策，克服把定额工作简单化的作风，深入车间、发现问题、研究问题、解决问题，克服过去坐在办公室里，忙事务的毛病。
    二、加强标定工作，首先进行标定员的思想教育，加强其责任心，提高他们对业务的兴趣，改善标定方法，使标定达到科学合理。
    三、党、政、工、团密切配合，加强工友的定额教育和职员干部的业务教育，特别是有关部门应精通定额工作。今后修改定额必须精密计算，并通过群众讨论。
    四、由于定额不合理，所产生的工资悬殊现象，按实际情况予以补救。从九月份起实行新定额，使工资逐渐合理。
