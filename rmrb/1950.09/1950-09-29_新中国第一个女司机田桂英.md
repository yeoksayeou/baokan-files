　　Tian Guiying, The First Woman Driver of New China
　　Chen Ji
　　Tian Guiying is welcomed everywhere she goes in Beijing.

　　In the room of a sleeper car, a dozen workers are gathered around a person, all asking for the same thing: "Please sign your name for us!" After signing for these people, others outside the carriage shout the same request. This person who is warmly welcomed and constantly signing autographs and leaving messages is Tian Guiying, the first woman driver of New China. On September 21st, she and the hero and model representatives from the entire Northeast took this train to Beijing to attend the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers. Why is she so warmly welcomed everywhere she goes? Tang Yunying, a female comrade from the Harbin Railway System, put it well: "Because you have set an example for women participating in heavy industry construction, you are our banner."

　　"Who gave us this glory? It's Chairman Mao. It's the Communist Party."

　　Tian Guiying feels that going to Beijing to see Chairman Mao with such glory was something she could never have dreamed of in the past. This girl, who came from a fishing family, started rowing boats, steering, casting nets, and catching fish, crabs, and oysters in the wind and rain from the age of seven, working from dawn till dusk. However, the exorbitant taxes of the puppet Manchurian regime were too heavy, and the whole family could not get enough to eat. She had to change her profession to become a printing worker and a ticket seller in a canteen. At that time, she only knew to work hard to support her parents; and to earn a few more dollars to buy some silk thread and embroider a dowry pillow, so that she would have something to rely on for the rest of her life. Thinking about the painful life of oppression she had endured for more than a decade and her own naive ideas, and seeing how warmly welcomed she is today and how glorious she has become, she excitedly repeats: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party leading us to turn over, if it weren't for the Soviet comrades training us to learn how to drive trains, how could we have gotten rid of the shackles of the past? How could we have today's glory?"

　　"Go to Beijing, see Chairman Mao, thank Chairman Mao for saving us and giving us glory." This has been a long-held wish of Tian Guiying. Over the years, she has heard that worker models often see Chairman Mao, and she always hopes: "When will I be able to see Chairman Mao!" Lin Xianpei, a female tram driver from Dalian, published an article in the newspaper entitled "I Saw Chairman Mao." Tian Guiying read it over and over again, unwilling to put it down. Every time she thought of Chairman Mao, she felt a force pushing her to study hard to become a driver. She heard that she could see Chairman Mao on this trip to Beijing, and she was so happy that she couldn't speak. She asked her companions: What should I say when I see Chairman Mao? The female stoker Cheng Shulan said: "When you see Chairman Mao, you must represent us in wishing Chairman Mao a long life!"

　　Tian Guiying Correctly Mastered the Technology of Driving a Train

　　The train sped quickly towards the interior of the country. The vast fields of sorghum, like a sea, reflected beautiful vermilion colors onto the train windows. Sitting on this train, Tian Guiying looked down at the resource-rich Northeast wilderness, revealing a happy smile. Du Xianyang, a special-class labor hero and a pacesetter of the Iron Ox Movement, walked in from another room and had a lively conversation with Tian Guiying about his practical experience in driving. When Du Xianyang asked Tian Guiying how she usually operates the locomotive, prevents skidding, how she stoked the fire, and how she oiled the engine, Tian Guiying answered fluently and said repeatedly, "Our 'March 8th' will learn from you!" Listening to her answers, Du Xianyang constantly praised, "Okay, really good!" While speaking, Tian Guiying carefully observed a rectangular, dark black card. On the cover of the card were printed golden words: "Steam Locomotive Driver's Certificate." Inside, in bold Chinese and Soviet languages, it read: "It is hereby certified that Tian Guiying has indeed passed the theoretical and practical examinations for steam locomotive drivers prescribed by the Ministry of Railways and has the right to independently drive steam locomotives. Special Certificate. Locomotive Department of the China Changchun Railway Bureau, September 18th." This was the glorious certificate that Tian Guiying obtained on September 18th, two hours before leaving Harbin, when she participated in the driver's examination of the China Changchun Railway Bureau. Recently, Tian Guiying has successively participated in two conferences: the "May 1st" Second Northeast Railway Labor Model Conference and the first Northeast Congress of the Youth League in August. She had not driven a train for a month or two. She did not expect to encounter this exam while passing through Harbin on her way to Beijing. At 10:00 a.m., the news that the China Changchun Railway Bureau had notified Tian Guiying to take the exam at 1:00 p.m. reached the Railway Trade Union. People were worried about her, fearing that she had not driven for a long time and would not do well on the exam. However, Tian Guiying answered fluently during the examination, scored 80 points, and received the driver's certificate.

　　From "March 8th" this year, Tian Guiying and her crew drove the "March 8th" locomotive, pulling a dozen cars every day, carrying passengers between the winding and hilly roads of Dalian and Lushun. In July, they began running the 105-kilometer-long line from Dalian to Wafangdian. Although their crew—the first heroic crew of New China—was entirely composed of female drivers, female stokers, and female firemen who had just learned some skills, they—these novices—were all determined to pave a new road for Chinese women. They not only learned to drive, but also drove very well, creating considerable achievements: From "March 8th" to the end of August, the "March 8th" locomotive had no accidents of any responsibility, safely traveled more than 30,000 kilometers, and saved 51 tons and 766 kilograms of coal, becoming a reserve Iron Ox team member of the Dalian Locomotive Depot.

　　Learning Technology Was Achieved Through Arduous Struggle

　　When Tian Guiying and her colleagues began to learn how to drive trains, they were opposed by conservatism and feudal ideas: Some said that it was unlucky for women to be on the train, and that train would be unlucky; others said that no matter how good a body was, it was just a woman, and it couldn't be done! Her father said, "Why learn that? It's almost time to get married in a few more years." When they went to the hospital for physical examinations, some doctors said with a straight face, "You railways are just joking, no matter how good a woman's body is, it's not as good as a man's!"

　　Indeed, driving a train is not easy. Several tons of coal have to be shoveled into the furnace one shovel at a time, and then shoveled out again one shovel at a time. Without a strong body, it is impossible to do it. The first time Tian Guiying got on the train, she saw that the driver had to pull the whistle, lift the lever, switch on the steam valve, and bend over to look out the window for signals, constantly paying attention to whether there were obstacles. She thought to herself: "How can I do it if it's so complicated?" The fireman was so tired that he kept sweating and was covered in coal like a black boy. Although she worked hard, the furnace stubbornly produced "turtles": a black patch on the left and a white spot on the right, and the fire was always not strong, and she could not build up steam.

　　However, under the cultivation of the Party and superiors, and with the help of Soviet comrades, and with their determination to work hard, they made rapid progress. They got on the engine early in the morning and learned technology with lanterns. Others cleared the furnace and prepared the train shortly before driving, but they prepared one or two hours earlier; others learned technology quickly and easily, but they always asked questions repeatedly and studied carefully; they were afraid of accidents when driving.

　　Eight months, eight months of hard work, they finally learned to drive. (Attached picture)

　　新中国第一个女司机田桂英

    田桂英上北京，到处受人欢迎。
    在一辆寝车的房间里，十来个工人团团围着一个人，共同要求一件事情：“请你给咱签个名吧？”给这些人签过了，车箱外面又有人嚷着同样的要求。这个被人热烈欢迎，不停地给人签名留言的人就是新中国第一个女司机——田桂英。九月二十一日她从沈阳和全东北英雄模范代表们乘着这列车到北京参加全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。她为什么这样到处受人欢迎呢？哈尔滨铁路系统的女同志唐云英说得好：“因为你给咱妇女参加重工业建设做了榜样，是咱们的一面旗。”
    “谁给咱这样光荣？是毛主席。共产党。”
    田桂英觉得她这样光荣地到北京去，看毛主席，在过去是做梦也想不到的。这个渔家出身的姑娘，从七岁开始，就在汪洋大海上摇船，把舵、撒网，起早贪黑的在风吹雨打下捕鱼、抓螃蟹、捞海蛎子，但伪满时代的苛捐杂税太重，全家老小得不到温饱，她只好改行当印刷工人、饭堂卖票员。那时候，她仅知道勤苦干活，养活父母；再就是多赚几个钱，买些丝线绣个出阁枕头，将来一辈子总算有依靠。她想着十几年来受压迫的痛苦生活和自己的幼稚想法，又看到今天这样受人欢迎，有了这样光荣，她激动地重复着说：“要不是毛主席、共产党领导咱翻身，要不是苏联同志培养咱学习开火车，咱怎能摆脱过去的锁枷？怎能有今天这样的光荣？”
    “到北京，看毛主席，感谢毛主席救了咱，给咱光荣。”这是田桂英早就有的一颗心愿。这些年，她听见工人模范常常见到毛主席，心里老希望：“咱几时能见着毛主席呵！”旅大电车女司机林先培曾在报纸上发表了一篇“我看见毛主席”的文章，田桂英看了一遍又一遍，舍不得放下来。她每次想到毛主席，就感到有一股力量，推动着她艰苦学习司机工作。她听说这次到北京，可以见到毛主席，高兴得连话都说不出来，她问她的同伴：看见毛主席，该说什么话？女司炉程淑兰说：“见到毛主席，一定要代表咱们祝福毛主席万寿无疆！”
    田桂英正确掌握了开火车的技术
    列车向关内飞快地驶去，大地上一片海似的高粱，向车窗反射着美丽的朱红彩色，坐在这列车上的田桂英俯视着蕴藏丰富的东北原野，露出幸福的微笑。特等劳动英雄、铁牛运动旗手杜先扬从另一个房间走进来，和田桂英畅谈开车的实际经验。当杜先扬问田桂英平常怎样操纵机车、防止空转，怎样焚火、给油时，田桂英滔滔不绝地答复着，并连说：“咱们‘三八号’要向你学习！”杜先扬听着她的回答，不断地发出赞语：“行，真成！”田桂英一面说话，一面仔细观察着一张长方形的黝黑色卡片，在卡片封面印有金黄色的字样：“蒸汽机车司机证明书”，里面横印着鲜明的中苏两国文字：“查田桂英确实经过铁道部所规定之蒸汽机车司机理论及实际考试及格，有权独自驾驶蒸汽机车，特此证明。中国长春铁路局机务处九月十八日。”这是田桂英在九月十八日离开哈尔滨的前两小时，参加中长路局司机考试，获得的光荣证明书。最近田桂英接连参加了两个大会：“五一”东北铁路二届劳模大会，八月的青年团东北首届代表大会，已有一两个月没有开车了，她想不到这次路过哈尔滨来北京的途中碰上这次考试。上午十点钟中长路局通知田桂英在下午一点去参加考试的消息传到铁路工会，人们都替她捏了一把汗，怕她多久没开车，考不好。但是田桂英在考试时对答如流，考上了八十分，领到了司机证明书。
    从今年“三八”节那天起，田桂英和她的包乘组驾驶“三八号”机车，每天牵引十来个车皮，载着旅客奔驰在多弯道、多坡道的大连和旅顺之间。七月，又开始跑一○五公里长的大连到瓦房店的线路。她们——新中国第一批英雄的包乘组，虽然全部是由刚刚学会一些技术的女司机、女司炉和女火夫组成的，但她们—这些新手都抱着为中国妇女开辟一条新道路而奋斗的决心，她们不仅学会了开车，而且能开得很好，创造了不小的成绩：从“三八”到八月底，“三八号”机车没有发生过任何责任事故，安全走行三万多公里，省煤五十一吨七百六十六公斤，成了大连机务段的预备铁牛队员。
    学会技术是经过了艰苦斗争的
    田桂英她们在开始学习开火车的时候，便遭到保守和封建思想的反对：有的说，女人上火车是不吉利的，上那个车，那个车就倒霉；有的说，再好的身体，也不过是个女人，那里能行！她父亲就说：“学那个干啥？再对付几年就该出阁了。”到医院检查体格，有些医生板着面孔说：“你们铁路尽开玩笑，女人体格再好也不如男人哪！”
    的确，开火车是不容易的，好几吨煤得一锨锨送进炉口，投完后又一锨锨往外掏，没有强壮身体，是干不了的。田桂英第一次上车，看到司机既要拉汽笛、提力把、开关汽门，又要把身子弯向窗外看信号，不停地注意有无障碍，她心里想：“这样复杂，怎办？”烧火工人累得汗水一直流，满身煤炭像个黑小子。她虽然拚命地苦干，火炉里却偏偏烧出“王八”：左一块黑色，右一处白点，火老是不旺，烧不上汽。
    但是在党和上级的培养下，在苏联同志的帮助下，她们又有刻苦努力的决心，因此她们进步很快。她们起早上车头，带灯学技术。人家掏炉、整车都在开车前不久，她们却先准备一两个钟头；人家学技术又快又易懂，她们学技术总是翻来复去地问，仔仔细细研究；她们开车时生怕出了事故。
    八个月，艰苦奋斗的八个月，她们终于学会开车了。（附图片）
