All Employees of Shijingshan Power Plant
　　Improve Safety Measures to Welcome National Day
　　Strive to Achieve Over 2,000 Improvement Suggestions Made by Employees During Safety Inspection

[Our Newspaper's News] This month, the Shijingshan Power Plant launched a mass safety inspection throughout the entire plant. Following this, the employees proposed a total of 2,119 suggestions for improvements, repairs, reinforcements, and additions. The Liu Dezhen team took the lead in proposing that, in addition to completing the production plan this month, they would guarantee to complete seven items. Workers throughout the plant responded enthusiastically. The plant is now engaged in a fervent production competition to complete production tasks, eliminate hidden dangers, and ensure safe power generation, in order to welcome the first National Day.

The plant conducted a safety inspection in June, achieving considerable success. This month's comprehensive safety inspection is being conducted on the basis of past achievements. Before the inspection began, a plant-wide inspection committee was established, divided into five groups: technical, specialized inspection, propaganda and mobilization, protection, and organization. These groups first conducted study sessions. Then, a comprehensive safety inspection was launched, combining administrative leadership from top to bottom, trade union leadership from bottom to top, and specialized groups in the horizontal dimension. The entire process lasted five days. The highest individual record for improvement suggestions was made by Ma Jixiang, the party branch secretary of the boiler workshop, who submitted 90 suggestions; the Liang Fengchang team submitted 302 suggestions. After the safety inspection, Liu Dezhen, the labor model representative of the plant who was elected to attend the National Congress of Laborers, immediately suggested to the plant's trade union: "These are valuable suggestions from everyone, and we must find ways to implement them." After careful study, the trade union accepted this suggestion and called on all employees to carry out a campaign to eliminate hidden dangers and ensure safe power generation to welcome the first National Day and the National Congress of Laborers. As soon as the trade union's call was issued, the Liu Dezhen team immediately proposed: "In addition to completing this month's production tasks, we will commit to completing seven items, delivering them before October 1st, and guaranteeing the quality of all items." They also issued a challenge to other teams, writing: "We will use the campaign to eliminate hidden dangers and ensure safe power generation to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and the Korean People's Army in defeating the aggression of American imperialism." As soon as the Liu Dezhen team's challenge was issued, teams throughout the plant responded enthusiastically. On the eve of Liu Dezhen's departure for Beijing to attend the labor model representative conference, the trade union convened a plant-wide employee meeting. The workers were in high spirits, and the entire plant is now working hard to complete the production plan, eliminate hidden dangers, and ensure safe power generation.
