　　Chinese Peasants Firmly Defend World Peace
    ——Comprehensive Report from This Publication

    The signature campaign to defend world peace is being carried out enthusiastically in rural areas across the country. Millions of peasants in various provinces are signing the Stockholm Appeal batch after batch to defend world peace.

    In rural areas where land reform and social reforms such as rent reduction and interest rate reduction have been implemented, the vast number of liberated peasants are very enthusiastic about signing for peace. In the northeastern countryside, this movement is unfolding universally and enthusiastically. The number of signatories in the entire Northeast region has exceeded more than half of the total population, the majority of whom are peasants. Among the 5,300,3,297 signatories in Liaodong Province, 3,521,163 were peasants, accounting for more than 66 percent of the province's signatories. The people of Shuangfengsi Village, District 8, Chengde County, Rehe Province, suffered cruel massacres by Japanese imperialists during the puppet Manchukuo regime. Therefore, their hatred for aggressors is particularly deep. Everyone in the village signed to oppose wars of aggression. The peace signature movement in rural areas of North China and Inner Mongolia has recently experienced exceptionally rapid development. In Shanxi Province alone, more than 1.6 million peasants have signed. The number of peasants who signed in Chahar Province also exceeded one million. Male and female herders of the sparsely populated Alurqin Banner Baiyindilanutu in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region rode horses, holding their children, and traveled far to sign. In East China, although peasants in various places are busy with farming, they are still enthusiastically participating in the signing. After the signature campaign was launched in Xiyouli Village, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, people were still rushing to sign from three miles away at midnight, carrying lanterns. Rural women in the suburbs of Wuhu City, southern Anhui, gathered in groups to sign, beating gongs and drums. The rural areas of Central South and Northwest China have similarly enthusiastic scenes of the peace signature movement. According to incomplete statistics from seven special districts including Huangchuan and Chenliu in Henan Province, 2,179,510 peasants have signed. The Guangxi Guibei Daily received more than 70,000 signature books and letters firmly expressing their defense of peace in the first half of July, many of which were peasant signatures. Following rural customs, they pressed their fingerprints on the signature books. Some were sealed with red paper, with the words: "We want peace and demand a ban on atomic bombs." According to statistics from eleven counties in southern Shaanxi on July 15, 120,000 peasants had participated in the signing. Within three days of launching the peace signature movement in Zhouzhi Bamboo District, Shaanxi, more than 13,000 peasants signed, accounting for 76 percent of the district's population. Among the more than 1.4 million signatories in Xinjiang Province, the majority are Uyghur peasants. In the vast rural areas of eastern and western Sichuan in the Southwest region, the results of the peace signature campaign are also remarkable. In the 35 counties and cities under the jurisdiction of eastern Sichuan, more than 4 million people have signed. More than 300 Tibetan compatriots from Lingchangzhai in Songpan County, western Sichuan, participated in the signing. Three Tibetan peasants in Mao County did not have time to catch up with the signing by the propaganda team, so they went to a nearby elementary school to ask about the meaning of the signature and solemnly wrote their names on the peace declaration: Maijier, Ayangzhe, Deeryisiman.

    The methods of the peace signature movement in rural areas in various places mostly begin with unfolding various forms of propaganda. In the northeastern provinces of Liaoxi and Liaodong, it is generally carried out in conjunction with central tasks such as summer hoeing, catching insects, and flood prevention. The signature campaign is mainly launched through various meetings, such as district and village people's representative meetings, model worker meetings, production team leader meetings, women's representative meetings, and cadre joint meetings; propaganda and signature campaigns are also carried out at market fairs or when dike-building laborers are concentrated. Some areas first convene cadre conferences, where everyone first understands the significance of the peace signature, and then, without hindering production, use methods such as roadside chats or reading newspapers to conduct brewing propaganda, and finally convene village meetings to sign. The number of signatories in Liaoxi and Liaodong has now exceeded more than 54 percent of the total population. Experience has proven that the methods they have adopted are very effective. In most villages in Ji County, Hebei, organizations such as the "Anti-American Aggression Committee" and the "World Peace Defense Committee" have been established, and propaganda is widely carried out through mass rallies, street dramas, waist drums, cartoons, rooftop broadcasts, blackboard newspapers, street lectures, storytelling, and door-to-door chats, so that the significance of the peace signature is known to every household, thus creating a upsurge in the peace signature campaign. According to statistics from August 10, 150,000 people in the county have signed, accounting for 42 percent of the county's population, and the number of signatures in some villages has exceeded 90 percent of the entire village's population. It is now continuing enthusiastically in conjunction with propaganda protesting the invasion of our northeastern airspace by American aircraft and the killing and wounding of our compatriots. In eastern and western Sichuan, primary and secondary school teachers and college students were mobilized to participate in propaganda, and methods such as going to market fairs, chatting in teahouses, and conducting family visits were used to link the significance of the peace signature to the farmers' vital interests, and to combine it with central tasks such as anti-bullies and rent reduction, to conduct propaganda and launch the signature campaign. Because this method was adopted to promote the peace signature movement, the number of signatures in rural areas of western Sichuan alone increased by one million in forty days.

    In the rural peace signature movement, due to the wide-ranging propaganda, the peasants have received a basic political education, and their understanding of the international situation has been considerably improved. At the same time, because the propaganda is combined with production and central tasks, the slogan "Defend world peace, we must do a good job in production" has become the practical action of the vast number of peasants. Farmers in Yanliuzhuang, Wuyang County, Henan Province, collectively swore an oath in front of Chairman Mao's portrait before signing. They said: "We liberated ourselves by following Chairman Mao, and now we must follow Chairman Mao to defend world peace and live a peaceful life forever." Shang Fazi, a peasant in Daluozhuang Village, Xuchang, led his entire family to sign. He said: "The more names signed, the more secure the fruits of liberation." Xu Fuxiang, an old farmer in Yanghucun Village, Yangzhai District, Funing County, northern Jiangsu, said after signing: "Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army burned my home to the ground, and American imperialism wants to invade us again. We resolutely oppose it to the end. This year, I will definitely be the first to pay the public grain in the summer requisition, ensuring that every grain is dry and supporting the army to liberate Taiwan as soon as possible." A peasant from Lugui Village, Laibin County, Guangxi Province, traveled sixty miles from the countryside to the city to sign in defense of world peace. All 340 people in Yuejiazhai Village, District 9, Xi'an, signed, and they set up a signature table at the main intersection of the village to mobilize more than 300 passersby to sign. Chen Tingshan, a labor model in Linjiang County, Liaodong Province, said after signing: "I am determined to lead the production mutual aid group well, ensuring that each laborer produces sixty more stones of grain than last year, in order to increase the strength of peace." Farmers in Tuyang Village, Nanping, Fujian Province, are determined to defend world peace with practical actions. After signing, they immediately organized 42 people to participate in the construction of roads, and at the same time organized labor exchange groups to cultivate the fields of road construction workers. The laborers building dikes on the Xiushui River in Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, became even more motivated after hearing the propaganda about the peace signature campaign. Everyone put forward the slogan "Build the dike well, cultivate the land well, and defend world peace," and as a result, the entire project was completed seven days ahead of schedule, saving more than 1,400 laborers. More than 30,000 people in Qingyuan County, Shanxi Province, have signed. Because their political awareness has been raised in the signature movement, and they have understood the relationship between friendship between China and the Soviet Union and defending world peace, more than 3,000 people have automatically applied to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

    For many years, Chinese peasants have suffered from the oppression of imperialism and reactionaries and the disasters of war. They now realize that the American imperialists' attempt to destroy world peace through acts of aggression cannot but arouse deep anger in their hearts. This emotional anger is fully demonstrated in the high tide of rural peace signatures.

　　中国农民坚决保卫世界和平
    ——本刊综合报道
    保卫世界和平签名运动正在全国各地农村中热烈地进行着。各省数以百万计的农民一批又一批地在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名保卫世界和平。
    在实行了土地改革和减租减息等社会改革的农村中，广大的翻身农民对于和平签名是非常踊跃的。在东北农村中，这一运动普遍热烈地展开着。东北全区的签名人数已超过人口总数的一半以上，其中大多数为农民。辽东省五百三十万零三千二百九十七个签名者中，有三百五十二万一千一百六十三个是农民，占全省签名人数百分之六十六以上。热河省承德县八区双峰寺村的人民，在伪满时曾遭受过日本帝国主义者的残酷屠杀，因此对侵略者的仇恨特别深，全村所有的人都签了名，反对侵略战争。华北及内蒙各地农村中的和平签名运动最近均有异常迅速的发展。仅山西一省就有一百六十余万农民签了名。察哈尔省签名的农民也超过了一百万人。内蒙古自治区地广人稀的阿鲁尔沁旗白音地拉努图克的男女牧民，骑着马，抱着孩子，跑到很远的地方去签名。在华东方面，各地农民虽正在农忙中，还是踊跃参加签名。浙江省富阳县西邮里村签名运动展开以后，半夜里还有人从三里外打着灯笼赶来签名。皖南芜湖市郊的农村妇女，成群地敲打着锣鼓集会签名。中南、西北各地的农村中，和平签名运动有着同样热烈的光景。据河南省潢川、陈留等七个专区的不完全统计，签名的农民已达二百一十七万九千五百一十人。广西桂北日报于七月上半月内，即收到七万多人的签名册和坚决表示保卫和平的信件，其中很多是农民的签名，他们都按照农村习惯，在签名册上捺了指纹。有的并用红纸封上，在上面写着：“我们要和平，要求禁用原子弹。”据陕南十一个县七月十五日的统计，参加签名的农民已达一十二万人。陕西周至竹区在和平签名运动发动后的三天内，即有一万三千余农民签名，占全区人口百分之七十六。新疆省一百四十余万的签名者中，大多数为维吾尔族农民。西南区川东、川西的广大农村中，和平签名的成绩也很显著。川东所辖三十五个县、市已有四百余万人签名。川西松潘县灵昌寨番族同胞三百余人参加了签名。茂县三个番族农民没有来得及赶上宣传队的签名，特地跑到附近小学问明了签名的意义后，郑重地在和平宣言上写下了他们自己的名字：麦姐儿、阿阳哲、得尔伊斯曼。
    各地农村的和平签名运动的方式，大都从展开各种各样的宣传开始。东北辽西、辽东等省，一般是结合夏锄、捉虫，防汛等中心工作来进行的。发动签名主要是通过各种会议，如区村人民代表会、劳模会、生产小组长会、妇女代表会、干部联席会；也有在市集上，或在修堤民工集中时候进行宣传并发动签名的。有些地区先召开干部大会，大家首先弄通和平签名的意义，然后在不妨碍生产的情况下，利用地头唠喀或是念报等方式进行酝酿宣传，最后召开村民大会签名。辽西、辽东的签名人数现均已超过人口总数的百分之五十四以上。经验证明，他们所采用的方式效果是很好的。河北蓟县等地大部分村庄都成立了“反美侵略委员会”和“保卫世界和平委员会”的组织，普遍通过群众集会、街头剧、腰鼓、漫画、屋顶广播、黑板报、街头讲演、说评书、讲故事、串门啦喀等方式进行宣传，使和平签名的意义家喻户晓，因而造成了和平签名的热潮。据八月十日的统计，该县已有十五万人签名，占全县人口百分之四十二，有些村庄的签名人数已在全村人口的百分之九十以上。现正结合抗议美国飞机侵入我东北领空杀伤我同胞的宣传继续热烈地进行中。川东、川西等地动员了中小学教师及大中学学生参加宣传，采用赶场、茶馆漫谈、家庭访问等方式，把和平签名的意义联系农民的切身利益，结合反恶霸、减租等中心工作，进行宣传和发动签名。由于采用了这种方式来推进和平签名运动，仅川西农村签名人数在四十天内即增加了一百万人。
    在农村的和平签名运动中，由于展开了广泛的宣传，使农民们受到了一次基本的政治教育，农民们对国际形势的认识，相当地提高起来。同时由于宣传结合了生产和中心工作，使“保卫世界和平、必须搞好生产”的口号成为广大农民的实际行动。河南省舞阳县阎刘庄的农民集体在毛主席像前宣誓后签名。他们说：“咱们跟着毛主席翻了身，现在还要跟着毛主席来保卫世界和平，永远过安乐日子。”许昌大罗庄村农民尚发子带领着全家人签名。他说：“签的名字愈多，翻身果实愈牢靠。”苏北阜宁县羊寨区羊胡村的一个老农徐福祥在签名后说：“蒋介石匪军把我家烧光了，美帝国主义又想来侵略我们，我们坚决反对到底。今年夏征我一定头一个缴公粮，保证粒粒干燥，支援大军早日解放台湾。”广西省来宾县禄贵村一个农民为了签名保卫世界和平，特地从乡下跑了六十里路到城里去签名。西安九区岳家寨全村三百四十人都签了名，他们并在本村大路口设了签名桌，发动了三百多个过路人签名。辽东省临江县劳动模范陈廷山在签名后说：“我决心把生产互助组领导好，保证秋后每个劳动力比去年多打六石粮食，好增加和平力量。”福建省南平涂洋村农民决心以实际行动来保卫世界和平，他们签名后立刻组织了四十二人参加修建公路，同时组织换工组代耕修路民工的田地。辽西省新民县正在秀水河修堤的民工，听到和平签名的宣传后，工作劲头更大了。大家提出“修好堤、种好地、保卫世界和平”的口号，结果整个工程提前完成七天，节省了一千四百多个民工。山西省清源县已有三万多人签名，由于他们在签名运动中政治觉悟的提高，了解到中苏两国友好对保卫世界和平的关系，即有三千多人自动申请加入中苏友好协会。
    中国农民多少年来遭受了帝国主义和反动派的压迫和战争的灾害，他们现在认识到美帝国主义企图以侵略罪行破坏世界和平，是不能不引起心上深烈的愤怒的，这一种愤怒的情绪在农村和平签名的高潮中充分地表现出来。
