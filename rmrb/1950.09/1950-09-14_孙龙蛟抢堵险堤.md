Sun Longjiao Bravely Blocks a Dangerous Dyke

    Sun Longjiao is a first-class meritorious worker in harnessing the Yellow River, and has won the first-class meritorious worker medal from the Yellow River Harnessing Headquarters. At this Shandong Provincial Model Heroes Congress, he was also selected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Labor Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.

    Sun Longjiao is twenty-nine years old this year and is a second-class disabled veteran. He suffered hardships since childhood and has excellent qualities of hard work and simplicity. In the summer of 1945, he joined the army. Under the education of the Party, his class consciousness quickly improved. In 1946, he joined the Party. He participated in more than a dozen battles and consistently demonstrated tenacity and bravery in combat. In 1947, the enemy attacked Lunan, besieging our battalion with two or three brigades of troops in Zhangqiu. When our army broke through the encirclement, he was wounded by a bullet in his right side and became a second-class disabled veteran.

    Last autumn, his regiment accepted the task of building dykes and dams along the Yellow River, and Sun Longjiao went with the troops.

    When they arrived at the Yellow River, everyone worked hard. Sun Longjiao led his group of three, carrying earth, transporting stones, building dykes and dams during the day, and checking dykes and preventing floods at night.

    One night at twelve o'clock, Sun Longjiao was on duty, checking the dykes and guarding against floods. The sky was dark, and he carried a lantern, carefully inspecting back and forth along the dyke. The weather after the autumn rain felt a bit cold, and his wound throbbed from time to time.

    When he walked to a place about a mile away from the Number Two house (where the dyke checkers lived), he suddenly noticed yellow water at the base of the dyke. He knew that the water outside the bank was clear, and this muddy yellow water must have flowed out from the Yellow River. He quickly searched carefully and saw a fist-sized hole at the base of the dyke. He didn't have any tools with him at the time, so he hurriedly used both hands to block it. The hole gradually grew larger, and his hands couldn't block it. He knelt down and used his knees to tightly block the hole, shouting desperately: "Come quickly to rescue the dyke! ... Come quickly to rescue the dyke...!"

    The yellow water flowed faster and faster, and the hole became larger and larger. Sun Longjiao didn't have time to think any further. With a "plop," he jumped into the water and pressed his back tightly against the hole. The hole was already the size of a small bucket, and the water rushed against his body, hitting him like a bull. He used all his strength to block it desperately, and shouted at the top of his lungs:

    "Come quickly to rescue the dyke! ... Quick, rescue the dyke...!"

    More than an hour later, the rescue team finally arrived. Everyone stuffed stones in, one shovel after another, filling the hole, and the hole was blocked. Comrade Sun Longjiao breathed a sigh of relief and said: "Finally, the dyke was protected, and no accident happened." A smile of victory appeared on his face.

    The next day, the responsible comrades and engineers from the Yellow River Harnessing Headquarters came to inspect. According to the engineers, if this dangerous breach had not been blocked in time, it would have been dangerous in another half an hour!

    Since then, Sun Longjiao's name has resounded throughout the Yellow River. Sun Longjiao's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people made him a banner of the Yellow River harnessing engineering team.

　　孙龙蛟抢堵险堤
    鸥波
    孙龙蛟是治黄一等功臣，曾得过治黄总指挥部的一等功臣奖章。在这次山东省英模大会上，他又被选为出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表。
    孙龙蛟今年二十九岁，是一个二等残废。他从小吃苦受罪，有艰苦朴实的优良品质。一九四五年夏天，他参了军。在党的教育下，他的阶级觉悟很快提高。一九四六年，他入了党。他曾参加过十多次战斗，在作战中一贯表现顽强勇敢。一九四七年，敌人进攻鲁南，在章邱以两三个旅的兵力围攻我们一个营。在我军突围的时候，他负了伤，被子弹打中了右腰侧，成了二等残废。
    去年秋天团里接受了到黄河边筑堤修坝的任务，孙龙蛟也随着部队去了。
    到了黄河上，大家都艰苦地工作着。孙龙蛟带领全组三个人，白天抬土，运石头，筑堤修坝；黑夜查堤，防水。
    一天深夜十二时，孙龙蛟担任查堤防水警戒的任务。天色漆黑，他提着灯笼，沿着堤坝，细心地来回巡视。秋雨后的天气，显得有点冷了，他的伤口一阵阵痛起来。
    当他走到距二号屋子（查堤人住的）一里处时，突然发现堤坝根上有黄水。他知道，岸外的水都是清的，这混澄澄的黄水一定是从黄河里边流出来的。他赶紧仔细找，看见堤根上有了一个拳头大的漏洞。当时他没带工具，就急忙用两只手去堵。洞渐渐大了，手堵不住了。他跪下，用膝盖紧紧堵住洞口；一面死命大叫：“快来抢险啊！……快来抢险啊……！”
    黄水愈流愈急，洞口也愈来愈大。孙龙蛟来不及再想，“扑通”一声，跳下水去，用自己的后脊背紧紧贴在洞口上。洞口已有小水桶大小，水冲到身上，像牛似的猛撞。他用出全身力气，死命堵着，一面放开喉咙拼命叫喊：
    “快来抢险哟！……快抢险哟……！”
    一个多钟头以后，抢险的人终于赶来了。大家把一块块的石头塞进去，一锨锨土填进去，洞堵好了。孙龙蛟同志松了口气说：“总算保住了堤岸，没出险。”脸上现出胜利的微笑。
    第二天，治黄总指挥部的负责同志和工程师来检查。据工程师说，这一险口若不能及时堵住，再迟半个钟头就危险了！
    此后，孙龙蛟的名字响遍了黄河两岸。孙龙蛟全心全意为人民服务的精神，使他成为治黄工程队的旗帜。
