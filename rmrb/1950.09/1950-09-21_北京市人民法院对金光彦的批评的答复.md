Title: Reply from the Beijing People's Court to Jin Guangyan's Criticism

To the Editor:

　　After reading the article "Can Organs and Cadres Be Treated Specially Before the People's Law?" published in "People's Garden" on August 29th, we believe it is necessary to explain the details of the matter.

　　On June 5th, we received a letter from the Tianjin People's Court requesting us to seal and auction all the assets of the Jianzhong Company's vermicelli factory located at No. 4 Guoxiang Hutong in Beijing to offset the company's debt to the Jilin Provincial Department of Finance's Production Management Office. On the 7th, our court sent personnel to seal the property in conjunction with the local police station, and entrusted Wu Shuhui, the wife of Jin Guangyan, an employee of the factory, to keep it safe. On the 14th, we legally notified both the plaintiff and the defendant to transfer the vermicelli factory to the plaintiff. On the 24th, we issued a property transfer certificate and notified the local police station in writing to unseal and transfer all the real estate. After Yan Ti, the agent of the plaintiff, received the property transfer certificate from our court, he sold the property to the Navy Headquarters through the introduction of the Liquidation Bureau. The Navy Headquarters, eager to start work, limited Jin Guangyan, an employee of the vermicelli factory, to move out within three days, but Jin Guangyan did not agree. Our court then sent comrades Ma Ying and others to mediate, changing the moving deadline to five days; Jin Guangyan still did not agree. We then notified both parties to come to the court to resolve the matter. Based on Jin's opinion on July 27th, and in order to take care of Jin Guangyan's difficulty in moving, it was decided to extend the moving deadline to ten days. The reason we asked Jin Guangyan to leave and kept Yan Ti for a private conversation was to ask Yan to take care of Jin Guangyan's difficulties in moving and not insist on the five-day moving deadline, to avoid disputes in court and create a stalemate. Jin Guangyan then mistakenly believed that we were biased towards one party, which was actually his prejudice.

　　As for the crops planted by Jin Guangyan, Jin said, "Why didn't the court first explain the reasons for not paying compensation, but instead asked the Navy Headquarters if it could pay compensation? Since they asked that, it means the matter depends on whether the other party pays." Regarding this issue, when the court notified Yan Ti and Jin Guangyan to mediate the relocation issue on the 28th, Li, the section chief of the Execution Section of our court, first asked him why he was still demanding compensation for losses. At that time, although Section Chief Li believed that compensation should not be paid in principle, at Jin's request, it would be okay to solicit the other party's opinion, and if they were willing to pay a little money, mediation could be carried out to end this minor dispute. However, Yan Ti did not agree, and we had to reply to Jin Guangyan with the following reasons: You are an employee of the vermicelli factory, and you planted on the vermicelli factory's land. If you suffer any losses as a result, you should request compensation from Wang Zhengbo, the manager of the factory, and cannot demand a certain price from Yan Ti or the Navy Headquarters. And when limiting Jin Guangyan to vacate the house within ten days under guarantee, it was announced that the crops did not belong to him, and if he disagreed, he could appeal separately. Jin did not go through our court or consult with the police station, and forcibly picked the ripe and semi-ripe crops. After the police station reported Jin's barbaric behavior, we summoned Jin Guangyan, pointed out that his actions were wrong, and finally asked him to go back and wait for investigation.

　　In handling this issue, we believe that: From July 14th, when Wang Zhengbo, the manager of Jianzhong Company, agreed to hand over the assets of the vermicelli factory to Yan Ti to offset the debt, to the 26th, when the police station was notified to inform Jin Guangyan to unseal and hand over to Yan Ti, Jin Guangyan's wife should be notified first to unseal and revoke her responsibility for safekeeping, and then hand over to Yan Ti for receipt. This is a shortcoming in our handling procedures. When Yan Ti sold the property to the Navy Headquarters and a dispute arose between him and Jin Guangyan regarding the vacation of the house and the crops, we took into account the work situation of the Navy Headquarters on the one hand, and also took care of Jin Guangyan's difficulties in moving according to his opinion, extending the deadline from five days to ten days. Regarding the issue of the price of the crops planted by Jin Guangyan, we have already told him that he should directly seek compensation from Wang Zhengbo, and Yan Ti and the Navy Headquarters are not liable for compensation. The debt case of Jianzhong Company was handled by the Tianjin Court, and we did not regard Jin Guangyan as one of the parties involved in this case. Therefore, our handling of the vacation of the house and the crop issue was purely of a mediation nature and not a formal court hearing. Jin's criticism of our one-sidedly taking care of organ cadres is not in accordance with the facts.

### 北京市人民法院对金光彦的批评的答复

　　北京市人民法院对金光彦的批评的答复编辑同志：
    读了八月二十九日“人民园地”发表的《机关、干部在人民法律面前可以特殊一点吗？》一文以后，我们认为有把此事经过情形说述一下的必要。
    六月五日，我们接到天津市人民法院的信，嘱托我们将建中公司在京市国祥胡同四号粉丝厂房产全部查封拍卖，抵偿该公司对吉林财政厅生产管理处的欠款。七日本院派员会同该管派出所予以查封，并委托该厂职员金光彦之妻吴漱蕙讨保保管，十四日，依法通知原被告双方，将粉丝厂移交原告。二十四日发给了财产转移证书，并以书面通知该管派出所将房产全部启封移转。原告代理人阎禔收到本院财产转移证书后，经清管局的介绍，将房产卖与海军司令部。该部为急于进行工作，限粉丝厂职员金光彦在三天后搬家。但金光彦不同意。本院遂派马英等二同志前去调解，将搬家期限改为五天；金光彦又不同意。我们即通知双方到法院解决。根据金七月二十七日的意见，并为了照顾金光彦的搬家困难，决定将搬家期限展为十天。当时我们叫金光彦出去，留下阎禔进行个别谈话的目的，是要叫阎照顾金光彦的搬家困难，不要坚持五天的搬家期限，避免当庭争执，形成僵局。金光彦遂误认为我们偏袒一方，实际是他的偏见。
    至于金光彦所种作物问题，金说“法院为何不先说明不付代价的理由，而要先问海军司令部是否可以付代价？既然这样问，那就是说事情决定于对方付不付”。关于这一问题，二十八日法院通知阎禔、金光彦调解迁房问题时，本院执行科李科长首先问过他为什么还要求赔偿损失。当时李科长虽认为在原则上不应赔偿，但在金的要求下，不妨征求一下对方意见，如愿出一点钱的话，也可以进行调解，以结束这一小小的纷争。可是阎禔不同意，我们只好以如下理由答复金光彦：你系粉丝厂的职员，又是在粉丝厂的地皮上栽种，本人如因此而有所损失，应向该厂经理王正伯请求赔偿，不能要求阎禔或海军司令部给予一定代价。并在限金光彦讨保十天腾房时，宣布作物不归他所有，如有不服，可另行上诉。金竟不通过本院也不会同派出所，竟将已熟及半熟作物强行摘去。经派出所报告了金的这种蛮横行为后，我们乃将金光彦传到，指出他这种作法不对，最后叫他回去等候调查。
    在处理这一问题上，我们认为：自七月十四日建中公司经理王正伯答应将粉丝厂财产交阎禔抵偿欠债后，到二十六日通知派出所转告金光彦启封移交阎禔，其间应先通知金光彦之妻启封，撤销其保管责任，然后再交阎禔接收。这是我们在处理手续上的缺点。在阎禔将房产卖给海军司令部并与金光彦发生腾房和作物纠纷时，我们一面照顾海军司令部的工作情况，一面对金光彦搬家的困难也根据他的意见加以照顾，由五天展期十天。对金光彦所种作物代价问题，我们已告诉他应直接向王正伯追索，阎禔和海军司令部并不负赔偿责任。建中公司欠债案件，系由天津法院处理，我们并未把金光彦当作本案当事人之一，因此，我们在处理腾房及作物问题时纯属调解性质，并非正式开庭审理。金批评我们片面照顾机关干部，是与事实不符合的。
