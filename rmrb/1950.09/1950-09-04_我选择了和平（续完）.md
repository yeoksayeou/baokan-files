　　I Chose Peace (Conclusion)
    John Pitt
            Three
    Journalists who work for British and American newspapers often don't receive specific instructions about what the newspapers need. At the same time, journalists are fully aware of who is paying them. The newspapers belong to large trusts or large financial groups, so it's not difficult to guess what kind of news will suit their tastes.

    In 1947, two years after the end of the war, British and American journalists began to pay special attention to reporting on the "ominous" world of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, thereby supporting the American imperialists who were planning a third world war.

    Things developed to the point where Reuters plainly notified me that the news I was writing did not suit the current requirements.

    When I was in Warsaw, I tried my best in my reports to honestly describe the selfless labor of the Polish people in rebuilding their country, and to narrate how the reactionaries, with the support of the British and American embassies, were attempting to sabotage peaceful construction. When I returned to London, the editor-in-chief, Wilton Cole, called me in.

    He didn't ask me to change my attitude. On the contrary, he patted me on the shoulder jokingly and said, "Listen, my friend! I really like your work. I have no doubt that you have a bright future, as long as you are on our side. Of course, we know you have liberal views, and we never want to disturb your personal life. But if you want to really achieve something, then you have to restrain yourself a little. If you work hard, we plan to send you to Germany. We will soon make you the director of a large office and greatly increase your salary..."

    Now, when I recall this conversation, it suddenly becomes clear what Mr. Cole was focusing on. But at that time, I still thought that as an honest journalist, I could still do some useful things...

    Thus, I set off for Germany. I spent more than two and a half years here, until the day I announced at a press conference in the democratic sector of Berlin that I was unwilling to continue serving the warmongers.

    On March 9, 1948, about six months after my conversation with the editor-in-chief of Reuters, I received a letter from him. I still keep this letter, an excellent example of the methods of bribery, co-optation, and covert intimidation that they use to force journalists to write only things that benefit the warmongers.

    The letter read as follows:

    "Dear Mr. Pitt: Before I leave for the United States, I am telling you with great satisfaction that the management has approved an increase in your salary, while also increasing your office expenses.

    "I think it is necessary to bring to your attention that this decision proves the great expectations we place on your abilities, while considering that within the scope of our organization, you will rise to a very high level."

    "However, if there is any change in your future, then you can only blame yourself. Please forgive me for raising this issue again; but, starting from the matter I asked you to consider when we talked, I would greatly value your being able to gloriously complete your task in Berlin. We need news about Germany, the content of which can include a large amount of creatively manufactured material."

    The threat and the inducement are all too obvious.

    Before I received this letter, I had stayed in the Ruhr area for a few months. The situation for journalists there was similar to that in Vienna and Berlin. They lived in a hotel in Olris, a small industrial city far from the important centers. Almost all of them lived a holiday-like life, eating and drinking heavily, playing billiards, and waiting for British official reports. From these reports, they gleaned some news about the events taking place in the cities of the Ruhr area, where hunger and cold ruled that winter.

    Some journalists—who were not bad people in essence—saw the poverty around them and couldn't remain indifferent; they even helped them with their own personal money. But when hunger strikes broke out in Essen and Duisburg, they remembered their masters and began to telegraph the old tune: "Red agitators are carrying out sabotage activities in the Ruhr area..."

    The slanderous falsification—the story of the "M Minutes"—clearly pointed out the methods used by the Western newspapers. This minutes was considered to be "the secret communist plan to organize armed uprisings in the Ruhr area." The reactionary newspapers published what they thought was needed, ignoring the rest, resulting in a complete distortion of events.

    When I learned that the "M Minutes" had appeared in a newspaper in West Berlin, I immediately sent a dispatch to London. In my dispatch, I pointed out that this "document" was an obvious and stupid forgery, and compared this "document" to the slander about the "communist conspiracy."

    The major London newspapers published my dispatch with large headlines "Red Conspiracy," but they did not mention a word about the fact that I reported that the "M Minutes" was a forged document. Officers of the British Intelligence Agency blamed me for causing them to lose credibility.

    A week later, British Foreign Minister Bevin had to declare: "As a result of careful research, the 'M Minutes' are a forgery." But almost all the newspapers that had boasted about the "Red Conspiracy" forgot to publish this statement.

　　我选择了和平（续完）
    约翰·皮特
            三
    为英美报纸服务的记者们：常常不能得到报纸需要什么的具体指示。但同时，记者们都完全明白，他们得到的钱是从谁那儿来的。报纸是属于大托辣斯或大财阀的，因此不难猜想，什么样的通讯恰正适合于他们的口味了。
    一九四七年，即战争结束两年后，英美的记者们，开始特别注意于报道苏联及人民民主国家这一个他们认为“不祥的”世界，从而支持制造第三次世界大战计划的美帝国主义者们。
    事情发展到这个程度：路透社明白地通知我，说我所写的通讯并不适合当前的要求。
    我在华沙时，曾经尽力在我的通讯中诚实地描写复兴祖国的波兰人民的忘我的劳动，并叙述反动派在英美使馆的支持下，怎样企图对和平建设进行破坏。当我回到伦敦的时候，总编辑温尔顿·柯乌尔把我叫去。
    他没有要求我改变态度。相反，他却戏谑地拍拍我的肩膀说：“你听，我的朋友！我很喜欢你的工作。我并不怀疑你会有光辉的前程，只要你站在我们这方面。当然，我们知道你是有着自由主义的观点的，我们决不想打扰你的私人生活。但是，如果你想真正获得成就的话，那么你就要自制一些。如果你好好工作我们打算派你到德国去，我们不久就派你做一个大办事处的主任并且大大提高你的薪津……”
    现在，我回忆起这段谈话，才恍然明白。柯乌尔先生所注意的是什么。然而那时我心里还想，作为一个诚实的记者，我总可以做些有益的事情……
    这样，我就出发来德国了。在这里我度过了两年半以上的时光，直到我在柏林民主区的记者招待会上宣布不愿再继续为战争贩子服务的那一天。
    一九四八年三月九日，大约是我和路透社总编辑谈话后过了半年的时候，我接到了他的一封信。这封信我到现在还保存着，这是采取收买、笼络及暗中威吓方式的出色的样本，他们利用这种方法来迫使记者只写有利于战争贩子的东西。
    这封信如此写道：
    “亲爱的皮特先生：在我动身往美国之前，我以异常满意的心情告诉你，经理部已批准了增加你的薪俸，同时并提高你的办公费用。
    “我认为需要引起你注意的是：这个决定证明了我们对你的能力所寄与的大量的期望，同时考虑到，在我们的组织范围以内，你将升到很高的一级”。
    “然而，如果你的前途有什么转变，那么你就只能抱怨你自己了。请原谅我又提起了这个问题；但是，从我们谈话时我向你提出请你考虑的事情出发，我将非常重视你能够光荣地完成了在柏林的任务。我们需要关于德国的消息，其内容可以包括大量创造性地制造出来的材料”。
    威胁和利诱是再明显不过了。
    在我接到这封信以前，我曾在鲁尔区逗留了几个月。记者们在那里的情况，和在维也纳及柏林差不多。他们住在远离重要中心的一个小工业城市奥里斯的旅馆中。几乎全体都过着休假日般的生活，大吃大喝，打台球，等候着英国的官方报道。从这些报道中，他们摭拾些关于鲁尔区各城市所发生的事件的消息，那年冬天，饥饿和寒冷统治着这一带。
    有一些记者——他们本质上不是坏人——看到周围的贫穷状况，不能无动于中，他们甚至以自己个人的钱来帮助他们。但是当埃森和杜伊斯堡爆发了饥饿罢工时，他们就记起了自己的主人，开始打电报去重弹旧调：“赤色煽动分子在鲁尔区进行破坏活动……”
    诽谤性的伪造文件——“Ｍ会议记录”的故事，显明地指出了西方报纸所利用的方法。这个会议记录被认为是“在鲁尔区组织武装起义的秘密的共产党的计划”。反动报纸把他们认为需要的刊登出来，对其余置之不理，结果是时常把事件完全颠倒歪曲了。
    当我知道了柏林西部一个报纸上出现了“Ｍ会议记录”的时候，我立即向伦敦发出了一篇通讯。我在通讯中指出这个“文件”是明显的愚蠢的伪造，并把这“文件”和关于“共产党阴谋”的诽谤比较一番。
    伦敦各大报纸都以大号标题《赤色阴谋》刊登了我的通讯，但是他们对于我所报道的关于“Ｍ会议记录”是伪造文件这一点却一字不提。英国情报局的军官们责备我使他们失掉了信誉。
    过了一星期，英国外交部长贝文不得不声明说：“由于缜密研究的结果，‘Ｍ会议记录’是伪造的。”但是凡有吹嘘过“赤色阴谋”的报纸，几乎全都忘记了刊登这项声明。
