　　Halt the Bloody American Aggression!
    Solemn Declaration by All Representatives of the National Publishing Work Conference

    [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] The entire body of representatives attending the National Publishing Work Conference issued a statement on the 25th, opposing American imperialist aggression. The full text is as follows:

    The fascist chieftain of American imperialism is leading a group of vassal states in carrying out unbridled armed aggression. It openly dispatched a fleet to invade our Taiwan; its military aircraft have repeatedly intruded into our Northeast airspace, killing and wounding our compatriots and damaging our property. It is invading Korea, carrying out large-scale massacres of the Korean people. On the one hand, it is manipulating a group of vassal states to obstruct our country's representatives from participating in the United Nations, preventing the United Nations Security Council from fulfilling its task of maintaining peace under the principle of consensus among the five major powers.

    This series of aggressive acts and illegal actions by American imperialism has disrupted world peace and violated the United Nations Charter. We, representing all Chinese publishing workers, express to the world: We absolutely support the "Declaration on Preventing a New War and Strengthening World Peace and Security" proposed by the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. We will continue to expose the various crimes of American imperialism and call on the people of the world to fight against aggression and uphold peace.

    We declare to the world:

    (1) Taiwan is our country's territory, and American imperialism must not be allowed to invade it.

    (2) The act of American imperialism using force to invade Korea and massacre the Korean people must be stopped immediately; American troops must withdraw completely from Korean territory.

          The Entire Body of Representatives of the First National Publishing Conference
          September 25, 1950

　　制止美国血腥侵略！
    全国出版工作会议全体代表发表严正声明
    【新华社二十六日讯】我全国出版工作会议全体代表于二十五日发表反对美帝国主义侵略的声明。全文如下：
    美帝国主义法西斯头子带领着一群仆从国家进行肆无忌惮的武装侵略。它公然派遣舰队，侵略我台湾；它的军用飞机一再侵入我东北领空，杀伤我们的同胞，损坏我们的财产。它侵略朝鲜，大规模地屠杀朝鲜人民。一方面，它操纵了一群仆从国家，阻挠我国代表参加联合国，使联合国安全理事会不能够在五大国共同一致的原则下完成维持和平的任务。
    美帝国主义这一连串的侵略行为，非法举动，破坏了世界和平，破坏了联合国宪章。我们代表全中国出版工作者向全世界表示：我们绝对拥护苏联代表团向联合国大会提出的“制止新战争，巩固世界和平与安全的宣言”。我们将继续揭露美帝国主义的种种罪恶，号召全世界人民为反对侵略拥护和平而斗争。
    我们向全世界声明：
    （一）台湾是我国的领土，绝不容许美帝国主义侵略。
    （二）美帝国主义武力侵略朝鲜，屠杀朝鲜人民的行为必须立即停止；美国军队必须从朝鲜境内全部退出。
          第一届全国出版会议全体代表
          一九五○年九月二十五日
