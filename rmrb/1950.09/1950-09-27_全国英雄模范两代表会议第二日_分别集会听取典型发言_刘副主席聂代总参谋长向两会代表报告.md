In the afternoon, the two congresses merged to hear reports from leaders.

　　The National Congress of Combat Heroes, held this morning, began at 8:30 AM. When Commander-in-Chief Zhu De arrived, the venue erupted in warm applause.

Finally, Xiao Hua, on behalf of the presidium, read out three congratulatory telegrams and announced that as of last night, the congress had received 48 congratulatory telegrams and 1,134 congratulatory letters from national party, government, military, and people's organizations.

　　The National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, held this morning, heard typical reports from labor model representatives: Li Yong, the glorious "Mao Zedong" locomotive driver and labor model directly selected by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Zhao Guoyou, a lathe operator from Shenyang Third Machine Factory and labor model of Northeast China, who pioneered the new record movement; Tian Guiying, a railway labor model and the first female locomotive driver in New China; Yang Fuchun, a model trade union worker and chairman of the Linkou Locomotive Depot Trade Union and labor model directly selected by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Ding Zhihui, a model medical worker of the Central South Military Region and labor model representing the military; Yu Songru, an engineer from Tianjin No. 1 Textile Factory and labor model directly selected by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Zhang Shibao, a model factory guard from Shanghai Electric Power Company and labor model of Shanghai; Yang Liandi, a high-altitude hero of the Railway Corps and model representative of the military; and Ha Yin Jin (Mongolian), a herdsman and labor model from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In their reports, the nine labor model representatives briefly recounted many moving deeds and work experiences in production and construction and other various works. They unanimously and enthusiastically expressed their response to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, to learn more humbly in their work, to learn from the broad masses of the people, to unite as one, and to strive to establish a strong national defense and a strong economy.

　　All representatives of the National Congress of Combat Heroes and the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers jointly listened to reports from Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Central People's Government and Acting Chief of Staff Nie Rongzhen of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission at 3:00 PM today. When Vice Chairman Liu arrived at the venue, all combat hero representatives and labor model representatives paid tribute to Vice Chairman Liu, and the applause lasted for a long time.

　　In his speech, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi first expressed his respect to all the representatives attending the two congresses and praised their achievements in the struggle to overthrow the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and build a new China. Vice Chairman Liu said: In the past, there were many talented and creative hero models among the working people. However, under the old social system and the rule of the reactionary regime, they were suppressed and buried. Today, the power of the people has overthrown the old social system, overthrown the reactionary regime, and established a people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Talented and creative people among the working people are now valued and respected. That is to say, the new democratic social system can ensure that the talents and creativity of the working people are brought into full play. In the future, in terms of national defense construction and economic construction, more and higher-quality heroes and models will certainly be produced continuously.

　　Vice Chairman Liu then pointed out: In all aspects of national defense construction and economic construction, we need our own hero models as examples for everyone to learn from. The construction of New China requires more and higher-quality heroes and models. Therefore, the Communist Party and the People's Government must pay attention to the cultivation and promotion of hero model figures everywhere. He finally earnestly advised everyone to be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and rashness, and strive to learn.

　　In his report, Acting Chief of Staff Nie Rongzhen called on all hero model representatives to carry forward the spirit of patriotism, thoroughly liberate the whole of China, and defend world peace.

    【新华社二十六日讯】全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议第二日，在上午分别举行大会，由英雄、模范代表典型发言，下午两大会议合并举行，听取首长报告。

    本日上午举行的全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，在大会上作典型报告的劳动模范代表有：中华全国总工会直接评选的劳动模范代表光荣的“毛泽东号”机车司机长李永，东北区劳动模范代表新纪录运动的创始者沈阳第三机器厂车工赵国有，铁路劳动模范代表、新中国第一个机车女司机田桂英，中华全国总工会直接评选的劳动模范代表模范工会工作者、林口机务段工会主席杨富春，部队劳动模范代表中南军区模范医务工作者丁志辉，中华全国总工会直接评选的劳动模范代表天津中纺一厂工程师于松如，上海劳动模范代表上海电力公司护厂模范张世宝，部队模范代表铁道兵团登高英雄杨连第，内蒙古自治区牧民劳动模范代表哈音金（蒙族）。九位劳动模范代表在报告中简要地讲述了他们在生产建设和其他各种工作方面的许多动人的事迹和工作经验。他们一致热烈表示响应中共中央委员会和毛主席的号召，更虚心地在工作中学习，向广大人民学习，团结一致，为建立强大的国防和强大的经济力量而奋斗。
    全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的全体代表，在今日下午三时联合听取了中央人民政府刘少奇副主席和人民革命军事委员会聂荣臻代总参谋长的报告。当刘副主席莅临会场时，全体战斗英雄代表和劳动模范代表向刘副主席致敬，掌声经久不息。
    刘少奇副主席在讲话中首先向出席这两个会议的全体代表表示敬意，并赞扬他们在推翻国民党反动派的统治和建设新中国的斗争中的功绩。刘副主席说：过去劳动人民中有天才，有创造的英雄模范是不少的。但是，在旧的社会制度和反动政权的统治下，他们是被压制，被埋没了。今天人民的力量把旧的社会制度推翻了，把反动政权推翻了，建立了以工人阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。劳动人民中有天才，有创造的人，才被重视，被尊敬起来。就是说，新民主主义的社会制度可以保证劳动人民的天才和创造力得到发扬。今后在国防建设和经济建设方面，一定会不断地产生数量更多，质量更高的英雄模范。
    刘副主席接着指出：在国防建设和经济建设的各方面，都需要有自己的英雄模范作为大家学习的榜样。新中国的建设是需要数量更多，质量更高的英雄模范的。因此，共产党和人民政府必须到处注意对英雄模范人物的培养和提拔。他最后谆谆劝告大家要谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒燥，努力学习。
    聂荣臻代总参谋长在报告中号召全体英雄模范代表发扬爱国主义精神，彻底解放全中国，保卫世界和平。
