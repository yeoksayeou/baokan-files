　　Continue Disaster Relief, Long-Term Disaster Prevention!
    We have victoriously overcome last year's serious drought. This is the result of relying on the strength of the people themselves and the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government. Over the past year, the people in the disaster areas and the Party and government cadres have demonstrated unparalleled heroism and a spirit of mutual assistance and unity in the struggle against the drought. The people's governments at all levels have correctly implemented the Central People's Government's disaster relief policy, basically ensuring the realization of the slogan "no one should die of starvation."
    This time, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central Government summarized the disaster relief work of the past year, explaining the rich experience we have gained in overcoming the drought. One of the basic experiences is that the implementation of disaster relief work, this major political task, should be personally responsible by the heads of the people's governments at all levels. Under unified leadership, concentrate the strength of various departments and coordinate actions. In particular, senior cadres must personally go to the countryside, effectively grasp the disaster situation, and solve problems in a timely manner. This principle is very important and practical. In the past year, the State Council of the Central People's Government successively dispatched five disaster area inspection groups to Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and northern Jiangsu to inspect, offer condolences, and assist in the work. East China, Central South, and the affected provinces also had senior leaders leading cadres to go deep into the disaster areas to inspect and stay in the disaster areas to guide the work. This greatly enhanced the confidence of the cadres and people in the disaster areas to overcome the drought, promoted the spirit of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, social mutual assistance, and government streamlining and economy, and improved the effectiveness of disaster relief work. This method should be continued in future disaster relief work.
    Secondly, judging from the situation of the people's representative conferences held in various disaster areas in the past year, the disaster relief work was more successful in areas where representative conferences were held in a timely manner and the disaster relief issues were discussed in detail; otherwise, the work was worse. Experience has proven that only through discussions at the people's representative conferences can the strength of the masses be widely mobilized, and the experience and wisdom of the masses be concentrated to achieve the goal of working together to overcome the drought. Moreover, through the representative conferences, the mandatory command style of cadres can be effectively overcome and many difficulties in the work can be reduced.
    At present, many areas are still experiencing droughts, and the total affected area nationwide is more than one-third less than last year. Although most parts of the country have had a bumper harvest this year, the disaster situation in individual areas is more serious than last year (such as the flood in northern Anhui). This shows that disaster relief and prevention is a long-term task, and there should be long-term and comprehensive plans. The most important cause of disasters in China is still floods. Eliminating floods will solve the vast majority of disaster problems. For example, the construction of the Chaobai River in Hebei and the diversion of the Yi River in northern Jiangsu have greatly reduced the local floods this year. Hunan's restoration of Datong Lake has ensured a bumper harvest in the Dongting Lake area this year. Now the Central People's Government is determined to plan projects such as the harnessing of the Huai River. These are all fundamental solutions that focus on long-term interests. This is a great work, which the Kuomintang reactionary government has never been able to achieve.
    Generally speaking, last year's disaster relief work started a little late, which somewhat affected the development of the disaster situation. This year, in view of the experience and lessons learned last year, local governments immediately started disaster relief as soon as the new disaster occurred. This is a very good phenomenon, so this year's disaster situation has gradually subsided quickly. The experience gained in disaster relief work is worth remembering and promoting in the future.
    It is hoped that the people's governments at all levels, in accordance with the Ministry of Internal Affairs' summary of last year's disaster relief work, and in accordance with Premier Zhou's instruction that "disaster relief work should focus on long-term goals and start early," combine rectification and political construction to strive for continued disaster relief and long-term disaster prevention!

　　继续救灾，长期防灾！
    我们胜利地战胜了去年的严重灾荒。这是依靠着人民自己的力量和中国共产党及中央人民政府正确领导的结果。一年来各灾区人民和党政工作干部在与灾荒进行斗争的过程中，表现了无比的英勇气概和互助团结的精神。各级人民政府正确执行了中央人民政府的救灾方针，在基本上保证了“不饿死人”的口号的实现。
    中央内务部这一次总结一年来的救灾工作，说明了我们在战胜灾荒中获得了丰富的经验。其中有一条基本的经验，就是说，救灾工作这一重大政治任务的执行，应由各级人民政府的首长亲自负责，在统一领导下集中各部门力量，配合行动。尤其是高级干部必须亲自下乡，切实掌握灾情，及时解决问题，这条原则是非常重要而实际的。过去一年来，中央人民政府政务院曾先后派出五个灾区视察组，到达冀、鲁、豫、皖、及苏北等地巡视慰问和协助工作，华东、中南、及受灾的省份，亦均有高级首长率领干部深入灾区视察并长驻灾区指导工作。这就大大地增强了灾区干部和人民战胜灾荒的信心，发扬了城乡互助、社会互济和政府精简节约的精神，提高了救灾工作的成效，这种办法应在今后救灾工作中继续坚持下去。
    其次，从一年来各灾区召开人民代表会议的情形来看，凡是及时召开了代表会议，详细讨论了救灾问题的地区，那里的救灾工作就作得更有成绩，反之工作就差些。经验证明，只有通过人民代表会议的讨论，才能广泛动员群众的力量，集中群众的经验与智慧，达到群策群力战胜灾荒的目的。而且通过代表会议还可以有效地克服干部的强迫命令作风，减少工作中的许多困难。
    现在不少地区仍有灾荒发生，全国总的受灾面积虽比去年减少三分之一以上，今年全国大部分地区虽是丰收，但个别地区的灾情比去年为重（例如皖北的水灾），这就说明救灾和防灾是一种长期性的工作，应该有长远而全面的打算。中国的灾荒最主要的还是水灾，消除水灾就解决了绝大部分灾荒的问题。譬如河北修筑潮白河，苏北导沂，两处工程都使今年当地的水灾大大减轻了。湖南修复了大通湖，保证了今年洞庭湖滨的大丰收。现在中央人民政府又决心计划治淮等工程，这都是从长期利益着眼的治本办法。这是伟大的工作，这是国民党反动派政府始终不能实现的。
    一般地说去年的救灾工作动手稍迟了一些，多少影响了灾情的发展。今年各地政府鉴于去年的经验教训，新的灾情刚一发生，马上就动手救灾，这是很好的现象，所以今年的灾情，很快就逐渐减退。在救灾工作中已得的经验，值得我们在今后继续记取并加以发扬。
    希望各地人民政府根据内务部关于去年的救灾工作总结，同时遵照周总理“救灾工作要长期着眼及早动手”的指示，结合整风建政工作，为继续救灾，长期防灾而努力！
