　　The CCP Nanjing Municipal Committee Holds Enlarged Meeting for Rectification
    Inspects Work and Exposes Bureaucracy
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an enlarged meeting from the 23rd of last month to the 2nd of this month for rectification. The leading Party member cadres in charge of various departments in the city participated. The meeting inspected and summarized the various tasks of Nanjing City over the past year and conducted criticism and self-criticism of the shortcomings in the work. This laid the foundation for carrying out the rectification movement of Party member cadres throughout the city.

    The meeting began with a work report by Ke Qingshi, secretary of the Municipal Party Committee. After repeated and detailed discussions, the meeting made a comprehensive summary. The meeting consistently implemented the policy of combining rectification with actual work.

    The meeting first inspected the work based on policies and affirmed the achievements made. The meeting believed that the achievements were fundamental. They were mainly reflected in: the orderly conduct of takeover work; the gradual transformation of such a large and bloated bureaucratic consumer city over the past year; the dispersal of unemployed and jobless people, and the organization of refugees to engage in production for self-salvation, etc. At present, the basic masses of the city have been organized, and their political awareness has gradually increased, creating good conditions and a foundation for transforming the old Nanjing into a new Nanjing. The meeting criticized the impatient mentality of a few cadres, who hoped to transform Nanjing all at once. The reason for this impatient mentality was the failure to recognize various difficulties based on the specific situation. The meeting believed that urban transformation should be carried out systematically and step by step.

    When inspecting and summarizing the work, the meeting exposed the undesirable work styles of bureaucracy and commandism, as well as the behavior of some cadres who considered themselves meritorious, were proud and complacent, and even violated laws and regulations, engaged in corruption and embezzlement. The meeting pointed out that bureaucracy in leadership work is primarily manifested in a lack of in-depth research on the policies of the Central Committee, a lack of systematic understanding of the local situation, and a failure to inspect key tasks in a timely manner, resulting in blindness in certain tasks. For example, in production and disaster relief work, due to insufficient understanding of the situation, loans could not be properly allocated. Secondly, bureaucracy is also manifested in a lack of a scientific division of labor system. Some leading comrades are busy all day long, grasping everything big and small, and cannot effectively grasp the central link; they lack specific assistance to lower-level cadres, which more or less encourages the undesirable work style of commandism below. The meeting inspected the illegal and undisciplined behavior of some cadres, which aroused everyone's vigilance.

    The meeting believed that in the future, it is necessary to strengthen the study of policies and practical work in politics and improve the ideological and theoretical level of cadres. In organizational work, various systems should be established and improved: achieve a scientific division of labor, give play to the role of various departments, and strengthen the ties between superiors and subordinates.

    The rectification of Party member cadres throughout Nanjing City has begun after the conclusion of the enlarged meeting of the Municipal Party Committee, and a general rectification committee has been established to uniformly lead the rectification movement.

　　中共南京市委召开扩大会议进行整风
    检查工作揭发官僚主义
    【本报讯】中共南京市委员会于上月二十三日至本月二日举行了市委扩大会议进行整风。该市各机关主要负责的党员干部均参加。会议检查和总结了南京市一年来的各项工作并对工作中的缺点进行了批评和自我批评。为开展全市党员干部的整风运动打下了基础。
    会议首由市委书记柯庆施作了一年来的工作报告，经过会议反复详尽地讨论后，作出全面的总结。会议自始至终贯彻了整风与实际工作相结合的方针。
    会议首先根据政策检查了工作，肯定了工作中所获得的成绩。会议认为成绩是基本的。主要表现在：有秩序地进行了接管工作；一年来，对于这样一座庞大、臃肿的官僚消费城市，有步骤地进行了某些改造；疏散了失业无业人口，组织难民从事生产自救等。目前全市的基本群众大都已组织起来，政治觉悟逐渐提高，替改造旧南京为新南京创造了良好的条件和基础。会议批判了少数干部的急躁心理，即希望一下把南京改造过来。产生这种急躁心理的原因，是没有根据具体情况，认识各种困难。会议认为：城市改造应该是要有系统、有步骤地进行的。
    会议在检查和总结工作时，揭露了工作中的官僚主义和命令主义的不良作风，以及部分干部的以功臣自居、骄傲自满乃至违法乱纪、贪污腐化等行为。会议指出：领导工作上官僚主义，首先表现在对中央的政策缺乏深入研究，对本地情况不够系统了解，对主要工作未能及时检查，因而，在某些工作上带有盲目性。如生产救灾工作，由于不十分了解情况，使贷款不能恰当地分配。其次，官僚主义还表现在缺乏科学的分工制度。某些领导同志，成天忙忙碌碌，大小事情一把抓，不能很好地掌握中心环节；对于下级干部缺少具体帮助，或多或少地助长了下面的命令主义的不良作风。会议检查了某些干部违法乱纪的行为，引起了大家的警惕。
    会议认为：今后必须在政治上加强政策和实际工作的研究，提高干部的思想水平和理论水平。在组织工作上，应建立与健全各种制度：做到科学分工，发挥各部门的作用，密切上下级的联系。
    南京全市党员干部的整风，在市委扩大会议结束后，已开始进行，并已成立了总的整风委员会，统一领导整风运动。
