    Strengthening Solidarity Between the Chinese and British People
    Visiting British Representative Nitterdown
    Nitterdown, the British youth representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation, is the organization department director of the Central Committee of the British Communist Youth League. In his conversation with the reporter, he introduced the Sino-British Friendship Association, which promotes friendship between the Chinese and British people. This association has developed 800,000 members, including progressive organizations and trade unions such as the Tobacco Workers' Union, the Physicians' Association, the Association of Scientific Workers, and the Scottish Miners' Union. They are striving with all their might for the unity and friendship of the people of China and Britain. He said that after returning to his country, he will widely introduce the people of New China and the thriving production and construction to the British people. He believes that the work of the Sino-British Friendship Association will be greatly encouraged by this.
    Regarding the situation of British youth fighting for lasting peace, Nitterdown said that as of August 23, when he left Britain, one million British people had signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal, including 200,000 young people and 13,000 school students. The British branch of the World Peace Congress decided to present five million peace signatures as a gift when the Second World Peace Congress is held in Britain, and hopes to achieve one million of these signatures from young people.
    In the Labour government's war preparations, military spending has been repeatedly increased, and the term of military service has been repeatedly extended, while funding for construction projects related to people's livelihoods and welfare has been repeatedly reduced. The list of people needing housing has exceeded two million; school funding has been cut, and tuition fees for vocational night schools have increased by 10 percent this year, with many students crowded into one classroom. Under the pressure of American imperialism, the Labour government has tightly tied Britain to the American war chariot. This policy of "guns instead of butter" is increasingly being resisted by the broad masses of the British people.
    On the very day that Truman announced the launch of the war of aggression against Korea, the American Embassy in London received many protest letters from young workers. Since the British Labour government dispatched troops from Hong Kong to Korea to assist the American aggression against Korea, the voice of protest has become even louder.
    The British Communist Youth League is the vanguard of British youth. It unites a large number of progressive British youth from all walks of life to fight for the maintenance of people's democracy and for lasting peace. In 1945, it only had 1,000 members. This year, it has developed into a team of 3,500 people with 200团支部 [Tuan Zhibu, likely refers to League Branches, basic-level organizational units within the Communist Youth League]. Currently, the团中央 [Tuan Zhongyang, refers to the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League] has decided to develop 50 new 团支部 and 1,000 new members to celebrate the birthday of British Communist Party Chairman Pollitt on November 24th.
    Nitterdown, who worked as an engineer in Britain, told reporters about his impressions of visiting Northeast China. He said that as an engineer, he believes that the industrial construction in the Northeast has great prospects. During his two-week visit to the Northeast, he first saw that the space in the factories in the Northeast was large, while the factory buildings in Britain were the opposite, very crowded, which not only hindered development but also seriously damaged the health of the workers. Secondly, he saw many new workers working hard to learn technology. He heard many workers' talks, all of which showed that the workers were learning quickly and their enthusiasm for labor was growing. Every worker felt the importance of being the master in the development of production and construction. Moreover, he saw the determination of workers in every factory to support the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet. He said: This force is invincible. (Attached picture)

### 加强中英人民团结  访问英国代表尼特尔敦

    加强中英人民团结
    访问英国代表尼特尔敦
    尼特尔敦，世界民主青年联盟代表团英国青年代表，是英国共产主义青年团中央委员会的组织部部长。他在和记者的谈话中介绍了促进中英人民友谊的英中友协。这个友协已发展了八十万个会员，包括了烟草工会、医师协会、科学工作者协会和苏格兰矿工工会等进步组织和工会。他们正以一切力量为中英两国人民的团结和友好而奋斗。他表示于返国后，他将向英国人民广泛介绍新中国的人民和正在欣欣向荣的生产建设。他相信英中友协的工作将因此受到极大的鼓舞。
    关于英国青年为持久和平而斗争的情况，尼特尔敦说，截至八月二十三日他离开英国为止，英国人民已有一百万人在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签了名，其中二十万为青年，一万三千为学校学生。世界拥护和平大会英国分会决定在二届世界保卫和平大会在英国召开时，以五百万人的和平签名为献礼，并希望作到其中要有一百万为青年的签名。
    在工党政府的备战活动中，军费一再增加，兵役时间一再延长，而与人民生活福利有关的建设计划的经费却一再削减。登记需要房屋的名单已超过二百万人；学校经费削减了，今年职业夜校学费增加了百分之十，许多学生拥挤在一间教室里。在美国帝国主义的压力下，工党政府将英国紧紧地系在美国的兵车上。这种以“大炮代替牛油”的政策正日益遭到广大英国人民的反抗。
    就在杜鲁门发动侵略朝鲜战争的声明宣布的那一天，伦敦的美国大使馆便收到了许多青年工人们送去的抗议信件。自从英国工党政府由香港派军赴朝鲜为美国侵略朝鲜作帮凶后，抗议的声音是更加高涨了。
    英国共产主义青年团是英国青年的先锋队，他团结了众多的各阶层的英国进步青年为维护人民民主、争取持久和平而斗争。一九四五年时，他才有一千团员，今年已发展到拥有二百个团支部的三千五百人的队伍。目前团中央决定再发展五十个新的团支部一千个新的团员以庆贺英共主席波立特十一月二十四日的生日。
    尼特尔敦在英国作过工程师，他对记者谈他对参观我国东北的感想说，他以工程师的资格认为东北的工业建设是大有前途的。他在东北参观的两周间，首先看到东北工厂建筑的空间多，而英国的厂房与之正相反，非常拥挤，这不仅有碍发展，而且又严重地损害工人的健康。其次，他看见许多新工人努力学习技术，他听过许多工人的谈话，都说明工人们学习得很快，劳动情绪在增长。每个工人都感觉到在生产建设的发展中自己作为主人翁的重要性。而且他在每一个工厂中都看到了工人们支援解放台湾、西藏的决心，他说：这个力量是无敌的。（附图片）
