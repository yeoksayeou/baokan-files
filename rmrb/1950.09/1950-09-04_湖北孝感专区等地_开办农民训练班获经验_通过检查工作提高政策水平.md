Hubei Xiaogan Special District and other places
　　Running farmer training classes gains experience
　　Improving policy level through inspection work
　　[Report from this newspaper] According to the Hubei Daily: In order to welcome land reform after the autumn harvest, the farmer training classes run in Xiaogan Special District and Hanyang County have gained initial experience. Since March, counties in Xiaogan Special District have successively started running farmer training classes. According to statistics from six counties including Huang'an, Lishan, Sui County, Anlu, Xiaogan, and Yingcheng, more than 3,400 people have been trained. The first phase of the farmer training class in Hanyang County, Mianyang Special District, also concluded in late July.

　　The learning methods of the farmer training classes in the above-mentioned areas mainly involve reviewing the work of eliminating bandits and despots, reducing rent and interest, production to overcome famine, and the wheat levy, inspecting the trainees' positions, work styles, and implementation of policies, correcting bad work styles such as coercion and commandism, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Through analysis, the aim is to clarify the lines between right and wrong and improve political understanding and class consciousness. The experiences are as follows: (1) First, explain the purpose of running the training class, which is to lead the peasant brothers to liberate themselves. To liberate themselves, they must learn a set of methods and organize the masses. This quickly stabilizes the trainees' learning mood. (2) Initially, farmers are not accustomed to discussing problems and prefer listening to others. This requires guiding them, explaining that listening alone is not enough; only by discussing problems in connection with their own and their village's affairs can they understand the problems more clearly. Provide them with specific topics so that the discussion has content and can be quickly developed. (3) Improve policy and ideological levels and correct bad work styles through inspection work. This is a method that combines theory and practice. The first phase of the Hanyang farmer training class checked the work in three stages. At the beginning of each stage, an enlightening report was made, and typical examples were seized for criticism. The first stage checked the reasons for the victory or incompleteness of rent reduction; further inspection of the peasant ranks revealed the conspiracies of illegal landlords, clarifying that only by firmly relying on the poor and hired peasants and uniting the middle peasants can the landlords be defeated. The second stage checked the work style. Most of the trainees admitted that they drank the landlords' wine and accepted gifts in their work, and now they realize that this is a loss of position and a shameful thing that is unfair to the peasants. Everyone deeply regretted it and expressed that they would stand firm in the future and would not be bribed or deceived by the landlords. The commandist work style in the work was also criticized in this study. From the trainees' personal experience in the work, they realized that the result of commandism would be detachment from the masses. The third stage checked the implementation of policies. The main focus was on checking the implementation of uniting with the middle peasants and protecting industry and commerce, and opposing random beatings and fines. The method was to seize typical examples for criticism. (4) Carry out criticism and self-criticism, and combine it with evaluating merits and commending models. The main purpose is to find out the experiences and lessons in the work, criticize shortcomings and mistakes, and educate trainees to distinguish between right and wrong. There are the following points to note in this regard: First, there are generally two concerns when exposing shortcomings: fear of losing face and fear of punishment from superiors. Therefore, it is necessary to explain through meetings, large and small, that the purpose of inspection is to improve the work, and that being able to point out shortcomings is a sign of progress; and to call on activists to take the lead in inspection, seize typical examples to make reports at the conference, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Second, reward learning models and stimulate everyone's learning enthusiasm.

　　湖北孝感专区等地
    开办农民训练班获经验         
    通过检查工作提高政策水平
    【本报讯】据湖北日报消息：为迎接秋后土地改革，孝感专区及汉阳县所开办的农民训练班已获得初步经验。孝感专区各县自三月以来即先后开始开办农民训练班，据黄安、礼山、随县、安陆、孝感、应城等六县统计，已训练三千四百余人。沔阳专区汉阳县第一期农民训练班，亦于七月下旬结束。
    上述各地农训班的学习方法，主要是通过总结清匪反霸、减租减息、生产度荒、麦征等工作，检查学员的立场、作风和执行政策的情况，纠正强迫命令等不良作风，开展批评与自我批评；经过分析后，使之明确是非界限，提高政治水平和阶级觉悟。其经验有如下几点：（一）首先讲明开办训练班的目的，是为了领导农民兄弟翻身；而要翻身必须学习一套办法，把群众组织起来才行。这样使得学员的学习情绪很快安定下来。（二）开始，农民不习惯讨论问题，多喜欢听人讲。这就需要引导他们，说明光听不行，只有大家联系本人本村的事来讨论，才能把问题认识得更清楚。并给他们出些具体题目，使讨论有内容，且能很快开展起来。（三）通过检查工作来提高政策和思想水平，纠正不良作风。这是理论与实际结合的方法。汉阳第一期农训班分三个段落检查工作。每段开始都做了启发报告，抓住典型，进行批判。第一段检查减租胜利或不彻底的原因；进一步检查了农民队伍，认识了不法地主的阴谋诡计，明确了必须紧紧依靠贫雇农、团结中农，才能战胜地主。第二段检查作风，大部学员检查出自己在工作中吃地主的酒，接受礼物，现在认识到这是失掉立场，对不起农民的可耻的事。大家痛悔异常，表示今后一定站稳立场，不受地主拉拢欺骗。对工作中的强迫命令作风，在这次学习中也受到批判。从学员在工作中的亲身体验，认识到强迫命令的结果就会是脱离了群众。第三段检查执行政策情况。主要检查了团结中农和保护工商业的执行情况，反对乱打乱罚。方法是抓住典型进行批判。（四）开展批评与自我批评，并结合评功表扬模范。这主要是找出工作中的经验教训，批评缺点和错误，教育学员分清是非。这方面有如下几点体会：第一，暴露缺点时一般有两点顾虑：怕丢面子；怕上级处分。这样就必须通过大会、小会，说明检查的目的是为了改进工作，能说出缺点就是进步的表现；并号召积极分子带头检查，抓住典型在大会上做报告，开展批评与自我批评。第二，奖励学习模范，激发大家的学习热情。
