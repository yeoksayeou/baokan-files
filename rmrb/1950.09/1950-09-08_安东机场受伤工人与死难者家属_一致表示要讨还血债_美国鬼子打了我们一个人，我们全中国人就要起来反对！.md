Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 7th: Our correspondent reports: The blood shed by the workers at Andong Airport due to the American aggressors has ignited an unquenchable fire of hatred in the hearts of the victims. In the mouths of every injured person we interviewed, everyone said the same thing, which is: "We must avenge this blood debt!"

　　Among the eighteen wounded, Tan Dexiang was the most seriously injured. The bullet fired by the US Air Force from between his second rib on the left chest is still lodged in his left shoulder joint and has not been removed. He lay supine on the hospital bed, and bursts of pain caused beads of sweat to constantly burst out on his thin, yellow face. But he did not moan. The doctor who performed the surgery on him on the evening of the 27th of last month recalled the scene at the time: Tan Dexiang kept cursing: "American 'bearded bandits' ('bearded bandits' is a Northeast term, referring to bandits), Chiang Kai-shek's foreign father, injured me, and I must avenge this blood debt." His cursing lasted for a full hour and a half, from the beginning of the surgery until the end of the surgery.

　　Yu Zeren, who was shot in the right cecum of his buttocks, lay on his side in bed, and he spoke out the bold words that the people of New China cannot be bullied: "If the American devils knock down one of us, all Chinese people must rise up in opposition! They can't even touch a hair on our heads!" Wang Xuexin, leaning on crutches, tapped the ground twice with the crutches and said fiercely: "He put one hole in me, and I will put two holes in him."

　　In the mother of the deceased Wang Guanzhong, we also saw this unyielding spirit of the Chinese people. Her eighteen-year-old son was killed after being hit in the head by the US Air Force. Wang Guanzhong's head was completely shattered, so much so that his mother could only recognize him from the clothes and shoes he was wearing on his body. When she recounted this tragic scene, her eyes turned red. However, she did not shed tears, but opened her eyes and said, "We will avenge him!" Wang Guanzhong's eight-year-old younger brother, Wang Guanren, comforted his mother when he buried his brother, saying, "Mom, when I grow up, I will go and fight American planes!" The mother of the deceased used such stern words to educate our young generation. She said to Wang Guanren, "Hit the American devils hard and avenge your second brother!"

　　安东机场受伤工人与死难者家属
    一致表示要讨还血债
    “美国鬼子打了我们一个人，我们全中国人就要起来反对！”
    【新华社安东七日电】本社记者报道：美国侵略者使安东机场工人流的血，点起了受害者胸中不能熄灭的仇恨之火。在我们所访问过的受伤者口中，每个人都说到了一句同样的话，这就是：“我们一定要讨还这笔血账! ”
    在十八名受伤者中，谭德祥是伤势最重的一个。美国空军从他左胸第二根肋骨间射入的子弹头，直到现在还在左肩关节没有取出来。他仰卧在病床上，阵阵的创痛使他瘦黄的脸上不断迸出汗珠。但是他却没有呻吟。在上月二十七日晚上给他施行手术的医生回忆当时的情景说：谭德祥不断地咒骂着：“美国‘胡子’（‘胡子’是东北话，指土匪），蒋介石的洋爹，把我打伤了，非讨还这笔血账不行。”他的咒骂，从施行手术开始直到手术结束，整整有一个半钟头。
    被子弹击伤臀部右肓管的于泽仁侧卧在病床上，他说出了新中国人民不可欺侮的豪语：“美国鬼子打倒我们一个人，我们全中国的人就要起来反对！他就是动我们一根汗毛也是不行的！”拄着拐架的王学信，拿拐架在地上敲了两下，狠狠地说：“他打了我一个窟窿，我就要打他两个窟窿。”
    在死难者王管忠母亲的身上，我们也看到了中国人民这种不可欺侮的气概。她的十八岁的儿子是被美国空军击中头部后死去的。王管忠的头颅被完全炸碎了，以至使他的母亲只能从尸体上穿的衣服和鞋子才能辨认出来。当她在追述这段悲惨的情景时，眼圈便红润起来。但是，她没有掉下眼泪来，却睁着眼睛说：“我们会替他报仇的！”王管忠的八岁的弟弟王管仁在埋葬他哥哥的时候，曾安慰他的母亲说：“妈，我长大了，去打美国飞机！”死难者的母亲是用这样严峻的话句来教育我们年幼的一代的，他对王管仁说：“狠狠地打美国鬼子吧，替你的二哥报仇！”
