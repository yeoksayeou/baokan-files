　　Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and Seven Other People's Organizations Cable UN Security Council Demanding Sanctions Against U.S. Aggression
    [This newspaper dispatch] (This newspaper dispatch) The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Farmers Association, the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Municipal Democratic Youth Federation, the Municipal Student Federation, and the Municipal Sino-Soviet Friendship Association sent a cable to Malik, Chairman of the United Nations Security Council, and Secretary-General Lie on September 1, demanding sanctions against U.S. aggression. The cable stated: "The air force of the U.S. invading Korean troops intruded into our country's airspace on August 27 and 29, opening fire and killing and wounding our compatriots. The shameless provocation of U.S. imperialism is a further act of its consistent aggression and enslavement of the Chinese people. This fact has fully exposed the adventurous intention of the U.S. government to expand its war of aggression and undermine world peace. We, all workers, peasants, youth, and women of Beijing, hereby lodge a complaint with you, and request the United Nations Security Council to immediately take effective measures to sanction U.S. acts of aggression, and promptly withdraw U.S. troops invading Korea to safeguard peace and security in Asia and the world."
