　　Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas

　　Chapter I General Provisions

　　Article 1 These Regulations are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 40 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and with reference to the actual rural conditions in the newly liberated areas.

　　Article 2 The agricultural tax in the newly liberated areas shall be calculated and levied on a progressive basis, based on the average agricultural income per capita of the agricultural population of each household.

　　Article 3 All land with agricultural income shall be subject to agricultural tax paid by the recipient of the income, unless otherwise provided in these Regulations.

　　Article 4 The following types of land shall be exempt from agricultural tax:

　　1. Wasteland; however, this exemption does not apply to land that is wasteland due to neglect of cultivation.

　　2. Farms, forest farms, and nurseries for experimental purposes, approved by the people's government at or above the county (city) level.

　　3. Self-cultivated land of schools, orphanages, nursing homes, and hospitals, approved by the people's government at or above the county (city) level.

　　4. Agricultural production income of government agencies and military units that has already been used to meet state production quotas.

　　5. Those specifically exempted by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.

　　Article 5 The following types of land shall be exempt from agricultural tax for a specified period:

　　1. Newly cultivated barren land, for a period of three to five years, depending on the specific circumstances.

　　2. Reclaimed fallow land, for a period of one to three years, depending on the specific circumstances.

　　3. Land under rotation, during the year of fallow.

　　Chapter II Calculation of Agricultural Income and Agricultural Population

　　Article 6 The calculation of agricultural income shall be based on the normal annual yield of the land, in terms of jin.

　　"Normal annual yield" refers to the yield that should be harvested throughout the year under normal climatic conditions, general management, and planting habits.

　　The calculation of normal annual yield shall be based on the most widely planted main grain (hereinafter referred to as "main grain") in the locality, with other grains converted into main grain.

　　Article 7 For land of equal quality, if the harvest exceeds the normal annual yield due to diligent cultivation, good management, or planting of cash crops, the calculation shall still be based on the normal annual yield and not increased; if the harvest is less than the normal annual yield due to neglect of cultivation, the calculation shall still be based on the normal annual yield and not decreased.

　　Article 8 If the normal annual yield is increased due to the construction of water conservancy projects or other methods of land improvement, and the expenses are privately raised, the normal annual yield shall not be revised within five years; if the projects are undertaken by the state, the normal annual yield shall not be revised within three years.

　　Article 9 The method for calculating and levying taxes on forests or other special products shall be formulated by the provincial (municipal) people's government and submitted to the greater administrative region people's government (military and political committee) for approval.

　　Article 10 The agricultural population shall be calculated according to the actual agricultural population of the farm household at the time of preparing the agricultural tax register. Those whose main source of livelihood is not agricultural income may not be included in the calculation; however, revolutionary soldiers and personnel on the supply system may be included in the agricultural population of their families.

　　Hired farm laborers shall be included in the agricultural population of their own homes and not calculated in the employer's household.

　　When calculating the agricultural tax for families of martyrs residing in rural areas, the number of martyrs may be included in the number of agricultural population to show preferential treatment.

　　Chapter III Tax Rate and Calculation Method

　　Article 11 Households with an average annual agricultural income per capita not exceeding 150 jin of main grain shall be exempt from tax.

　　If the number of tax-paying households is less than 90 percent of the total number of agricultural households, the starting point for taxation may be reduced to 120 jin, as determined by the provincial (municipal) people's government based on the specific circumstances of the province (municipality).

　　Article 12 The agricultural tax rates are specified as follows: (Attached chart)

Notes:
1. The calculation in this table is based on the main grain, in units of jin of unprocessed grain.
2. According to Article 11, the starting point for taxation of 150 jin may be reduced to 120 jin, i.e., the first bracket "151 jin - 190 jin" should be changed to "121 jin - 190 jin".
3. This tax rate adopts a progressive tax system on the total amount above the starting point. The calculation method is illustrated as follows:
    Average income per capita of 200 jin, tax payable = 200 jin × 4% = 8 jin.
    Average income per capita of 500 jin, tax payable = 500 jin × 11% = 55 jin.

People's governments at all levels must strictly calculate and levy taxes in accordance with the tax rates stipulated in these Regulations and shall not freely increase or decrease them. For special households with an annual income of more than 200,000 jin, the provincial people's government may separately stipulate the amount of tax to be levied, but including local surcharges, the maximum shall not exceed 80 percent of their agricultural income.

　　Article 13 Where agricultural income cannot be calculated on a per capita basis, the tax shall be calculated and levied in accordance with the following provisions:

　　1. The income from cultivated land of schools, orphanages, nursing homes, and hospitals, which is used to supplement the operating expenses of the respective institutions; for cultivated land operated by hired labor, the tax shall be 7 percent of the total agricultural income; for land leased out, the tax shall be 10 percent of the rental amount.

　　2. State-owned farms shall be taxed at 10 percent of their total agricultural income.

　　3. Cultivated land of ancestral halls, societies, temples, and churches; for self-cultivated land, the tax shall be 14 percent of the total agricultural income; for land operated by hired labor, the tax shall be 25 percent of the total income; for land leased out, the tax shall be 40 percent of the rental amount.

　　4. The method for calculating and levying agricultural tax on cultivated land of Lama temples and mosques shall be separately formulated by the provincial (municipal) people's government and submitted to the greater administrative region people's government (military and political committee) for approval.

　　Article 14 If a taxpayer's land is scattered in different provinces (municipalities) or counties (cities), the agricultural tax shall be calculated and levied in accordance with the following provisions:

　　1. Self-cultivated and tenant-cultivated land at the intersection of provinces, counties, districts, and townships shall be calculated and levied together at the location of the taxpayer.

　　2. Leased land scattered in other provinces (municipalities) shall be treated as separate households at the location of the land, calculated and levied on a per capita basis.

　　3. Whether to combine the calculation and levy or to establish separate accounts for leased land scattered in various counties (cities) of the province or various districts and townships of the county (city) shall be determined by the provincial (municipal) or county (city) people's government for the convenience of taxation.

　　Article 15 Agricultural tax is calculated based on total income. Since self-cultivated land, leased land, and tenant-cultivated land have different income characteristics, namely total income and net income, in accordance with the principle of government rewarding labor and taking care of production, the tax shall be calculated and levied according to Articles 11 and 12 after conversion as follows:

　　1. The income from self-cultivated land and land operated by hired labor is considered total income, and every 100 jin is calculated as 100 jin.

　　2. The income from leased land is considered net income, and every 100 jin is calculated as 120 jin.

　　3. The income from tenant-cultivated land after paying rent is actually lower than the total income, and every 100 jin is calculated as 80 jin.

　　Article 16 The tax payment methods for leased land and tenant-cultivated land shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions:

　　1. For land with legally reduced rent and legally paid rent, the landlord and tenant shall bear the tax burden according to their respective income calculations.

　　2. For land without legally reduced rent, in addition to the landlord's income portion being calculated and levied at the prescribed rate based on the rental income and paid by the landlord, the tenant's income portion shall be taxed at a rate of 9 percent and also paid by the landlord.

　　After paying the tax, when the landlord implements rent reduction, the tax amount paid on behalf of the tenant may be deducted from the rent reduction amount.

　　3. For land where the landlord does not collect rent, the land shall first be divided into the tenant's income portion and the landlord's income portion in accordance with the rent reduction regulations. The tenant's income portion shall be calculated based on the tenant-cultivated income, and the landlord's income portion shall be calculated based on the rental income. The tax shall be calculated and levied separately at the prescribed rates, and all paid by the tenant.

　　After paying the tax, when the tenant pays rent, the tax amount paid on behalf of the landlord may be deducted from the rent payment amount.

　　Chapter IV Investigation, Collection, and Reduction/Exemption

　　Article 17 The number of mu of land, yield, and population of the taxpayer shall be investigated and assessed by the agricultural tax investigation and assessment committee organized by the township (village) people's government, including representatives of all classes, and the tax payable by each household shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations. An agricultural tax register shall be compiled and submitted to the county (city) people's government for approval.

　　Article 18 The agricultural tax amount shall be calculated once a year and collected in two seasons, summer and autumn; in areas with less summer harvest, it may be collected once in the autumn.

　　Agricultural tax shall be collected mainly in the form of local main grain, but may also be converted into other grains. The conversion ratio shall be formulated by the provincial (municipal) people's government, based on the principle of considering both public and private interests, and with reference to the general price ratio of various grains in the locality, and submitted to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval.

　　Article 19 In addition to ensuring the collection of the grain quantity necessary for the state, in order to facilitate payment by the people, agricultural tax may also be converted into cash and other agricultural products; the types, amounts, conversion ratios, and collection areas for conversion shall be formulated by the provincial (municipal) people's government and submitted to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval.

　　Article 20 After the crops are harvested, the township (village) people's government shall announce the tax amount approved by the county (city) people's government. Taxpayers must deliver the grain, cash, or other agricultural products to the designated grain storage warehouses or agencies within the time limit specified in the announcement and obtain official receipts.

　　For transportation distances exceeding 100 li round trip, transportation costs shall be paid for the excess mileage at the local general transportation rate.

　　Article 21 The grain delivered by taxpayers must be dried and cleaned, and shall not be mixed with water or impurities.

　　Article 22 The local surcharge for agricultural tax shall not exceed 15 percent of the regular tax and shall be collected together with the agricultural tax.

　　Article 23 If a taxpayer believes that there are inaccuracies in the investigation, unfair assessment, or calculation errors, they may apply to the agricultural tax investigation and assessment committee for reconsideration and re-verification; if they are still dissatisfied, they may appeal to the township (village), district, or county people's government; the township (village), district, or county people's government shall promptly investigate, and the county people's government shall make a ruling in accordance with the law. However, during the appeal period, the taxpayer must pay the tax on time according to the original tax amount, and the settlement will be made after the ruling.

　　Article 24 Those who have suffered from water, drought, insect, hail, or other disasters, and have been verified, may be given appropriate reductions or exemptions. The reduction and exemption methods shall be stipulated by the greater administrative region people's government (military and political committee) and reported to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for record.

　　Article 25 Revolutionary martyr's families, revolutionary military personnel's families, families of personnel on the supply system, and the elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, disabled, and other particularly impoverished persons, may be granted a reduction or exemption of their tax amount after assessment by the township (village) agricultural tax investigation and assessment committee and approval by the county (city) people's government.

　　Article 27 Those who violate the provisions of these Regulations, falsely report population, land area, and yield, and evade tax payment, shall be ordered to correct and pay the arrears after verification, and may be fined by the county (city) people's government up to 50 percent of the evaded tax amount.

　　Those who resist tax payment or disrupt grain collection work, and whose circumstances are serious, may be sent to the people's court for handling.

    ２．表列起征点１５０斤，依第十一条的规定，得递降至１２０斤，即第一级“１５１斤——１９０斤”应改为“１２１斤——１９０斤”。
    ３．本税率采用起征点的全额累进。计算方法举例如下：
    每人平均收入２００斤，应纳税额＝２００斤×４％＝８斤。
    每人平均收入５００斤，应纳税额＝５００斤×１１％＝５５斤。
    各级人民政府，必须严格依照本条例所规定的税率计征，不得自由增加或减少。特殊户全年收入在二十万市斤以上者，得由省人民政府另行规定征收额，但包括地方附加在内，最高不得超过其农业收入的百分之八十。
    第十三条  凡农业收入不能以人口平均计算者，依左列规定计征：
    一、学校、孤儿院、养老院、医院的耕地收入，用以充作各该机关经费者；其耕地，雇工经营者，按其农业总收入的百分之七计征；出租者按其租额的百分之十计征。
    二、公营农场，按其农业总收入的百分之十计征。
    三、祠堂、会社、寺庙、教会的耕地，自耕者，按其农业总收入的百分之十四计征；雇工经营者，按其总收入的百分之二十五计征；出租者，按其租的百分之四十计征。
    四、喇嘛庙、清真寺的耕地，其农业税计征办法，由省（市）人民政府另行拟订，报请大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）核定之。
    第十四条  凡纳税户的土地分散在外省（市）县（市）者，其农业税依左列规定计征：
    一、省、县、区、乡交界处的自耕地佃耕地，一律就纳税户所在地合并计征。
    二、出租地分散在外省（市）者，就土地所在地单独立户按一人计征。
    三、出租地分散在本省各县（市）或本县（市）各区、乡者，其应合并计征或分别立户计征，由省（市）县（市）人民政府依纳税之便利规定之。
    第十五条  农业税以总收入为计征标准，自耕地、出租地和佃耕地，因其收入性质有总收入和纯收入的不同，依照政府奖励劳动，照顾生产的原则，应按左列规定折算后，再依照第十一、第十二两条的规定计征之：
    一、自耕地和雇工经营土地的收入为总收入，每一百斤作一百斤计算。
    二、出租地的收入为纯收入，每一百斤作一百二十斤计算。
    三、佃耕地的收入为交租后的收入，实低于总收入，每一百斤作八十斤计算。
    第十六条  出租地和佃耕地的纳税办法依左列规定办理：
    一、依法减租和依法交租的土地，由业佃双方按各自收入计算负担。
    二、未依法减租的土地，除业主收入部分按出租收入依率计征，由业主交纳外，佃户收入部分，按百分之九的税率计征，亦由业主交纳。
    业主在交税后，进行减租时，得由应减租额中，将代佃户所交税额扣除之。
    三、业主不收租的土地，先按减租法令规定划分为佃户收入部分和业主收入部分，佃户收入部分按佃耕收入计算，业主收入部分，按出租收入计算，分别依率计征，统由佃户交纳。
    佃户在交税后，实行交租时，得由应交租额中，将代业主所交税额扣除之。
    第四章  调查、征收和减免
    第十七条  纳税户的土地亩数、产量和人口，由乡（村）人民政府组织包括各阶层代表在内的农业税调查评议委员会，进行调查评议，并依本条例的规定计算各户应交税额，填造农业税清册，报送县（市）人民政府核定之。
    第十八条  农业税额全年一次计算，分夏秋两季征收；夏收较少地区，得于秋季一次征收之。
    农业税以征收当地主粮为主，但得折征其他粮食，其折合比例，由省（市）人民政府本公私兼顾的原则，照当地各种粮食一般比价拟订，层报中央人民政府政务院核定之。
    第十九条  农业税除保证征收国家所必需的粮食数额外，为便利人民交纳，并得折征现款和其他农产品；折征种类、数额、折合比例和征收地区，由各省（市）人民政府拟订，层报中央人民政府政务院核定之。
    第二十条  农作物收获后，乡（村）人民政府根据县（市）人民政府核定的税额，列榜公告，纳税人须按公告规定，将应交粮食、现款或其他农产品，按期送交指定的收粮仓库或机关，取得正式收据。
    运送路程，往返超过一百里者，其超过里程，应按当地一般运价发给运费。
    第二十一条  纳税户所交粮食，必须晒干扬净；不得掺水掺杂。
    第二十二条  农业税地方附加，不得超过正税的百分之十五，随同农业税附征之。
    第二十三条  纳税户如认为有调查不实、评议不公或计算错误等情事时，得向农业税调查评议委员会声请复议、复核；如仍有不服，可再向乡（村）、区、县人民政府申诉；乡（村）、区、县人民政府应及时调查，由县人民政府依法裁定。但在申诉期间，纳税户须按原定税额如期交纳，俟裁定后清理之。
    第二十四条  凡遭受水、旱、虫、雹或其他灾害，经调查属实，得酌予减免，其减免办法，由大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）规定，报请中央人民政府政务院备案。

    第二十七条  凡违犯本条例的规定，虚报人口、地亩、产量，逃避纳税者，经调查属实，除订正补交外，并得由县（市）人民政府处以逃避税额部分的百分之五十以下罚金。
    如有抗税或破坏征粮工作，情节重大者，得送人民法院处理。
    第二十八条  行政人员在征粮工作中，有营私舞弊，或违法失职，致使国家、人民遭受损失者，予以行政处分；情节重大者，送人民法院处理。
