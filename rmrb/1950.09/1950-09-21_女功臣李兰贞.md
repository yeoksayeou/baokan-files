Female Labor Hero Li Lanzhen

Li Lanzhen, a nationally renowned special-class labor hero for supporting the front lines during the Huaihai Campaign, has been recognized as a first-class labor hero in the great Daoyi Project. She has now been selected as a delegate to the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Peasants, and Soldiers.

In 1940, after the establishment of the democratic government in northern Jiangsu, Li Lanzhen served as a group leader, and she consistently approached her work with diligence and responsibility; she never lagged behind in delivering military grain and making military shoes. She also actively participated in the rent reduction and land reform movement. In June 1947, Li Lanzhen was elected village chief. In September, when our main force attacked the enemy stronghold of Wulizhuang in Huaiyin County, stretchers were needed. She volunteered to carry a stretcher and expressed her determination to complete the task. Although she was a woman, the villagers couldn't stop her, so they had to let her go. At the front lines, whether rescuing the wounded or delivering ammunition, she was more capable and responsible than others. After this battle, she was recognized as a model of logistics. From then on, she participated in war service during the battles of Liancheng, Suqian, and Yugou. Because she was able to endure hardship, cared for the wounded, and protected ammunition, she was again recognized as a model when it came time for commendations.

On November 13, 1948, the Huaihai Campaign began. Young people from all over flooded to the front lines to support the troops. At this time, Li Lanzhen led five stretchers from her village and followed the army to the Huaihai battlefield. To avoid enemy bombing, the troops mostly moved at night. The weather was cold, and they had to climb mountains and cross rivers, but after ten days and four hundred miles, they finally crossed the Jinpu Railway and arrived at the front.

At the front, when transferring the wounded, they had to carry them forty or fifty miles every night. On Li Lanzhen's stretcher, three young men took turns carrying one end; she always carried the other end alone and didn't want anyone to replace her. During the march, to take care of the wounded, she always lifted or lowered the stretcher gently, and she was especially careful when the road was difficult. She often asked the wounded if they were thirsty or hungry, and if they were thirsty, she made tea, and if they were hungry, she made food. When it was cold at night, she gave her own quilt to the wounded. Li Lanzhen cared for the wounded with meticulous care, which often moved the wounded to tears. Every time they moved in the middle of the night, she always got up early to cook the food before calling everyone to get up and eat. Before leaving, she cleaned the pot, swept the floor, carried water for the landlord, and explained everything clearly before leaving. If she had any spare time, she would mend clothes and shoes for the laborers. In addition, she often educated the laborers, consolidating the labor team. One day, a group leader named Sun Weili wanted to desert, and she persuaded him, "Brother Weili, how can you, a man, think of deserting? Are you really not as good as me?!" After she said this, Sun Weili really didn't desert.

At the end of the Huaihai Campaign, at the commendation meeting in the special district, Li Lanzhen was recognized as a special-class labor hero for supporting the front lines.

In August 1949, Li Lanzhen was elected chairman of the township women's association. In November, when the Daoyi Project began, she automatically organized a women's team (nine people) to participate. She paid for two earthen baskets herself and helped others solve the problem of tools. When going to work, if people on the road had no grass to burn, she would spend her own money to buy grass to burn; when resting, she would go to pick up grass. After arriving at the work section, Li Lanzhen set up the shed and the stove faster than others. After work began, she worked even harder, getting up early and going to bed late; if there was water in the mud pit, she would rather go down herself than ask others to go. During the days of the project, it often rained. By the end of the project, most people did not get any grain to take home, but Li Lanzhen's women's team each took fourteen catties of grain home; and the project was done up to standard. At the commendation meeting held by the Daoyi Headquarters, she was recognized as a first-class water management labor hero.

In this spring's Daoyi Project, Li Lanzhen was again recognized as a model.

Li Lanzhen was originally from Longju District, Guanyun, northern Jiangsu. Her family only had five acres of land. She started picking vegetables and grass at the age of ten, and at the age of sixteen she followed her parents to Zhangji, Huaiyin County, to pick sweet potatoes. At the age of eighteen, she married Liu Wenyu of Zhangji. Liu Wenyu originally didn't have an acre of land and relied entirely on pulling a rickshaw to make a living. Since she came, after years of hard work, frugality, and thrift, they bought more than ten acres of land. After the establishment of the democratic government in the area, her family's life gradually improved. When people said that she had made great contributions, she always smiled and said, "This is not my personal ability, it is the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." This time, being selected as a delegate to the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Peasants, and Soldiers, she even more happily said, "I can see Chairman Mao this time, it really makes me happy and moved!"

　　女功臣李兰贞
    淮海战役中，闻名全国的支援前线特等功臣李兰贞，在伟大的导沂工程中，被评为一等功臣。现在又当选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表大会的代表。
    在一九四○年，苏北民主政府建立后，李兰贞担任小组长，她对工作一贯认真负责；送军粮、做军鞋，每次都不落后。她更积极的参加减租及土地改革运动。一九四七年六月，李兰贞被选为村长。九月，我主力部队打淮阴县五里庄的敌据点，需要担架。她自动报名去抬担架，并表示坚决完成任务。她虽然是妇女，但乡里拦不住她，只得让她去了。到了前线，无论是抢救伤员或送弹药，都比别人能干、负责。这次战斗结束，她被评为后勤模范。从此以后，部队打涟城、宿迁、渔沟等据点时，她都参加了战争勤务。因她能吃苦，爱护伤员，爱护弹药，评功时又被评为模范。
    一九四八年十一月十三日，淮海战役开始了。各地青壮年纷纷涌上前线，支援部队作战。这时，李兰贞领了本村五付担架，也随大军转战于淮海战场。部队为避免敌机轰炸，大部是夜间行动。天气冷，还要爬山过河，但经过十天时间，走了四百多里的路，终于过了津浦路，到达前线。
    在前方，转移伤员时，每夜要抬着走四、五十里。李兰贞的这付担架，三个青年换着抬一头；这一头始终是她一个人抬，不要人换。行军中，为了照顾伤员，她抬起或放下时，总是轻轻的，遇到路不好走，更是小心翼翼。她还常常问伤员渴不渴、饿不饿，渴了就烧茶，饿了就弄饭。夜间寒冷了，她就把自己的被子给伤员盖上。李兰贞爱护伤员无微不至，伤员常因此感动得流泪。每次半夜行动，她总是早早起来把饭弄好，再去喊人起来吃。临走时，把锅刷干净，地扫干净，给房东担了水，把东西交待清楚才走。如果有一点闲工夫，她就替民工们补衣服补鞋子。此外她还常对民工进行教育，巩固了民工队。一天，一个小组长孙维立想开小差，她就劝他说：“维立哥，你这男子汉还想开小差，当真不如我吗？！”孙维立被她这一说，真不开小差了。
    淮海战役结束时，在专区评功会上，李兰贞被评为支援前线的特等功臣。
    一九四九年八月，李兰贞又被选为该乡乡妇会长。十一月导沂工程开始，她自动组织一个妇女班（九人）参加导沂。自己出钱买了两个土簸箕，还帮其他人解决工具困难。上工去，大家在路上没有草烧，自己拿钱买草烧；歇下来，她就去拾草。到工段后，李兰贞搭棚支灶都比旁人快。开工以后，她更是起早睡晚的干；泥塘有水，情愿自己下去，不去叫别人去。工程进行的日子，天常下雨，结束时大部分人未落到粮食回家，可是李兰贞领导的妇女班，每人还落十四斤粮回家；工程又做得合乎标准。在导沂司令部召开评功会时，她被评为一等治水功臣。
    今春的导沂工程中，李兰贞又被评上了模范。
    李兰贞，原是苏北灌云龙苴区人，家中只有五亩田。她十岁就挑菜拾草，十六岁跟父母到淮阴县张集拾山芋，十八岁和张集刘文友结婚。刘文友本来没有一亩田，全凭拉黄包车吃饭。自她去后，经过多年的勤劳生产，省吃俭用，买了十多亩田。当地建立了民主政权后，她家的生活，才逐渐好起来。在有人说她功劳大时，她总是笑嘻嘻地说：“这不是我个人的本事，是共产党和毛主席领导好。”这次被选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表大会的代表，她更欢喜地说：“我这次能够去见毛主席，真叫我又欢喜又感动！”
