Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: The Pravda published an editorial on the 14th entitled "It is Necessary to Expose the True Colors of Warmongers," stating that peace-loving countries are increasingly aware that exposing a small group of warmongers is the main condition for maintaining peace. In September 1947, the Soviet delegation participating in the Second United Nations General Assembly proposed that the Soviet government condemn the reactionary groups in some countries for conducting war propaganda. This proposal was warmly supported by countries all over the world. Although the United States attempted to prevent the General Assembly from passing this condemnation, it did not succeed. But now the war-mongers of the United States and Britain have violated the UN decision and continue to advocate launching a new war.

The editorial pointed out: The people of the world have long condemned Churchill as a vicious enemy of world peace and security. American warmongers - Bradley, Johnson, Eisenhower, Matthews and MacArthur, etc. are clamoring for launching a new war, and the military and political leaders of the United States and Britain are also engaged in new war propaganda with the open support and sponsorship of their governments. These conspiracies have aroused the anger of the entire progressive humanity and demand an immediate end to this propaganda.

The editorial emphasized: One of the main tasks of peace fighters is to constantly expose war provocateurs and widely promote peace and friendship between nations to counter the propaganda of warmongers. Peace advocates warn those who clamor for the destruction of mankind to be responsible for their actions, and warn them that inciting a new war will be severely punished. This is the main purpose of preparing the Second World Peace Congress.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: The 37th issue of New Times magazine published an editorial discussing the new tasks of peace advocates, stating that since the ideal of defending peace became the first organized international movement in human history, people have clearly seen how powerful the peace movement represents. The strong will shown by the people of the world in the peace signature campaign has tied the hands and feet of imperialist politicians. Because peace advocates constantly remind them that it will never be successful to drive the people of all countries to a new slaughterhouse.

The editorial continued: In response to the international tension caused by American imperialism going to open attack, peace advocates have put forward new demands, which are universal reduction and control of armaments, opposition to acts of aggression, stopping armed intervention in Korea, and immediately eliminating this center of war crisis caused by American imperialism. Peace advocates also demand a ban on all propaganda that fuels the launching of war. This kind of propaganda has recently taken on an open and extremely vicious form, and its intention is clearly to poison the international atmosphere and intimidate good people.

The editorial emphasized: There is no doubt that the new demands of peace advocates will be supported by the vast majority of people in countries all over the world. During the preparation for the Second World Peace Congress, at various mass rallies held in various places, the specific requirements for laying the foundation for lasting peace must be widely discussed. This is the premise for further expanding the peace front. This kind of activity has now begun in various countries. The peace movement must draw infinite strength from the solemn goal of saving mankind from a new war. But if we want to mobilize and fully exert our strength, we must carry out continuous, regular and detailed explanatory work among the masses. The decisive struggle for the future of mankind is developing, and no honest person can escape this struggle.

The editorial finally emphasized that the goal of the peace movement is practical and completely achievable, and peace can be maintained. The situation in Korea has clearly shown that the aggressors have been politically and morally isolated. Peace advocates must fully and effectively use the power of their world-scale great movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: The diplomatic commentator of Izvestia wrote an article on the 14th discussing the preparations for the Second World Peace Congress to be held in London on November 13th, stating that the preparations around the world have achieved great success from the beginning. The number of people who have signed the peace declaration has exceeded 100 million in China, 15 million in France, 16 million in Italy, and has increased from 400,000 to 1.5 million in the United States before the Korean War. The Security Council has received more than 20,000 letters and telegrams from all over the world, unanimously demanding that the United States stop its aggression against Korea.

The commentary emphatically pointed out that one of the main tasks of peace advocates is to oppose the propaganda of new wars, to expose the open statements of warmongers such as Churchill, MacArthur, and Matthews on launching new wars of aggression, and to expose the US government and the British government that encourage new wars with aggressive actions with fierce propaganda.

The commentary concluded that the Second World Peace Congress will become a vivid demonstration of the growing strength of peace and democracy, and it will take a big step forward in the struggle for lasting peace.

　　广泛展开和平运动
    揭露战贩的真面目
    真理报社论
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十四日真理报以“必须揭露战争贩子的真面目”为题发表社论称：爱好和平的国家日益深刻地了解到揭露一小撮战争贩子们是保持和平的主要条件。一九四七年九月，参加第二届联合国大会的苏联代表团曾提出苏联政府斥责若干国家的反动集团进行战争宣传的提案，这一提案获得了全世界各国的热烈支持。美国虽企图阻止大会通过这一谴责，并未成功。但是现在美国和英国的战争贩子们却破坏了联合国的决定，继续主张发动新战争。
    社论指出：全世界人民早就斥责邱吉尔是世界和平与安全的恶毒的敌人。美国的战争贩子——布莱德雷、詹逊、艾森豪威尔、马休斯和麦克阿瑟等人正在叫嚣着发动新的战争，美国和英国的军事与政治领袖也在他们政府的公开支持赞助下从事新战争宣传。这些阴谋已激起了整个进步人类的愤怒，并要求立即停止这种宣传。
    社论强调称：和平战士的主要任务之一，便是不断地揭露战争挑拨者，并广泛宣传和平和各民族间的友谊，以对抗战争贩子的宣传。和平拥护者警告叫嚣着毁灭人类的人们要对他们的行为负责，警告他们煽动新战争将受到严厉的惩罚。这就是筹备第二届世界拥护和平大会的主旨。
    新时代杂志社论
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：三十七期的新时代杂志发表社论，论述和平拥护者的新任务称：自从保卫和平的理想成为人类史上第一次有组织的国际运动以来，人们已经清楚看到和平运动是代表着多么强大的力量。全世界人民在和平签名运动中所表现的坚强意志，已束缚住帝国主义政客们的手脚。因为和平拥护者不断提醒他们：要把各国人民驱上新的屠场是决不会成功的。
    社论继称：针对美帝国主义走到公开进攻而造成国际上的紧张局势，和平拥护者已经提出了新的要求，这些要求便是普遍裁减和管制军备，反对侵略行为，制止对朝鲜的武装干涉，并立刻消除由美帝国主义造成的这个战争危机的中心。和平拥护者并且要求禁止助长发动战争的各种宣传。这种宣传近来已采取了公开的、十分恶毒的形式，其用意显然是要毒化国际间的空气，并恐吓善良人民。
    社论强调指出：和平拥护者的新要求必将获得全世界各国最大多数人民的拥护，这是不容怀疑的。在筹备第二届世界拥护和平大会时，在各地举行的各种群众集会上，必须广泛讨论为持久和平奠定基础的各项具体要求，这是更进一步扩大和平阵线的前提。这种活动现在已经在各国开始了。和平运动要从使人类免于新战争的庄严目标中汲取无限的力量。但如果要把力量动员并充分发挥起来，就必须在群众中进行不断的、经常的和详尽的解释工作。为人类的将来而进行的决定性的斗争正在发展着，没有一个正直的人能逃避这种斗争。
    社论最后强调称：和平运动的目标是合乎实际并且完全可以达到的，和平是能够保持的。朝鲜的局势已经明白显示：侵略者在政治上和道义上都已陷于孤立。和平拥护者必须充分有效地运用他们的世界规模的伟大运动的权力。
    消息报专文
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报的外交评论员于十四日撰文论述将于十一月十三日在伦敦召开的第二届世界拥护和平大会的筹备工作称：全世界各地的筹备工作，一开始便获得了巨大的成就。在和平宣言上签名的人数，中国已超过一亿，法国已达一千五百万，意大利达一千六百万，美国已从朝鲜战争前的四十万人增加到现在的一百五十万人。安理会已接到从世界各地发出的二万多件函电，一致要求制止美国侵略朝鲜。
    评论着重指出：和平拥护者的主要任务之一是反对新战争的宣传，揭露邱吉尔、麦克阿瑟、马休斯等战争贩子对于发动新的侵略战争的公开声明，并且揭露用侵略行动去鼓励新战争的激烈宣传的美国政府和英国政府。
    评论结语指出：第二届世界拥护和平大会将成为显示和平与民主的壮大力量的生动的示威，它将使为持久和平而进行的斗争向前跨进一大步。
