Hebei Province Wuji County Dongfeng Village Military Dependents
Jointly Write Letter Reporting a Bumper Harvest
Cadres enthusiastically promote tilling on behalf of military families and implement the government's policy of rewarding cotton planting, resulting in improved living conditions.
[This newspaper reported] The military dependents of Dongfeng Village, Wuji County, Hebei Province, jointly wrote a letter to Chairman Mao with heartfelt gratitude, reporting that this year's crops are good, cadres are concerned about the work of tilling on their behalf, and the government's policy of rewarding cotton planting has been implemented, making their lives better. The original letter is as follows:
Dear Chairman Mao:
　　Our Dongfeng Village has a bumper harvest of cotton this year. Our twenty military families have even stronger cotton growth, and we have already picked two sprays. It looks like one mu of cotton can yield two hundred jin. We are extremely happy. We discussed writing to tell you, so you can rest assured and know that our lives are getting better.
　　Dongfeng Village has 440 households, and we military families have 20 households, cultivating a total of 242.5 mu of land, of which 120 mu are good flowering land (suitable for growing cotton) divided during land reform. The village has always cared about military families. This spring, the work of tilling on our behalf was adjusted again. According to the amount of labor in each household, a system of contracted farming and supplementary labor was appropriately implemented, and a contract was established to ensure the harvest. Village chief Cui Huncheng, civil affairs committee member Kou Shennian, and other cadres promptly inspected and held a meeting of military families and the households tilling on their behalf once a month to discuss and improve the work of tilling on their behalf, and to reward and criticize. This has further promoted the work of tilling on our behalf. In the spring, our land was plowed three times. People rushed to deliver manure to us. People like Kou Datou and Kou Sanchen, who didn't have livestock, used carts to deliver it, completely delivering the 720-plus carts of manure we had accumulated to the fields overnight. Village cadres and the Women's Federation cared about us, constantly coming to our homes to ask about production and living conditions. Li Wenqing, a military dependent, just returned from the city last autumn. The village gave him three new houses, four mu of good land, and a share of vegetable plots that had not been distributed. Cadres and villagers helped him settle down and start working. Village cadres helped us make production plans and said, "Planting more cotton will surely lead to prosperity." At the time, we were a little doubtful, but we figured the higher-ups never lied. Wang Chunjie, a worker's family member, planted all ten mu of her land, except for two mu of wheat, entirely with cotton. Then we planted all the land that could be planted with cotton. Village cadres were busy borrowing cotton seeds from the supply and marketing cooperative, solving our cotton seed shortage. We planted a total of 169.5 mu of cotton, accounting for more than 69 percent of all land. Other crops were also planted successively according to the season. After the cotton grew, hoeing, weeding, pruning, and removing side shoots were all done in a timely manner. Kou Sanshun, who tilled on our behalf, said: "Let's give priority to military families. People are shedding blood and sweat on the front lines to defend us all. We cannot let their families have difficulties." Influenced by this, Kou Baoqiu, Kou Zhongkui, and Wang Zengqun, three troublemakers, changed their ways and wanted to strive to be models. All the households tilling on our behalf did our work more diligently than their own. Early in the morning and late at night, they also swept the yards and padded the pigsties for households without labor, which really made us feel sorry.
　　Due to the enthusiastic help of village cadres and the households tilling on our behalf, we also did not rely solely on tilling on our behalf. The twenty households had a total of eighteen male laborers, seven female laborers, and seven half laborers (elderly women and children) who all participated in field production. Military family members like Kou Doubao and Kou Dalan helped each other, and Shi Lingwen, a female military dependent, learned how to hoe and weed. In the summer, we worked with the households tilling on our behalf to hoe the land four times, and the crops grew quite well, especially the cotton, which grew really strong. The cotton bolls were as dense as garlic cloves, the bolls were large, and the flowers were white. Selling one jin of cotton to the supply and marketing cooperative could be exchanged for eight or nine jin of rice. One mu of cotton could be exchanged for more than 600 jin of rice, which is equivalent to the yield of four mu of other crops. Shi Lingwen said with a smile: "Listening to Chairman Mao's words has really made us rich. This year's harvest alone will last me three years."
　　During the autumn harvest, people gave priority to harvesting our crops, harvesting as soon as they were ripe. Now 41 mu of millet and 18 mu of sorghum have been harvested and brought home, and the land has been plowed. The sorghum and millet harvests are both good. Sorghum yields 1.5 dan per mu, and millet yields 1.8 dan per mu. Under the leadership of Cao Rong, a woman representative, the women in the village also helped military families without labor to husk millet and pick cotton. Li Xiaoyuan, a military dependent, happily said, "This is even more thorough than when my son was at home!" We have no difficulties at all, and our lives are improving day by day. Every family is filled with joy. The higher-ups called for retaining more cotton fields this year, and we have all made up our minds. We are currently rushing to accumulate manure and harrow the wheat fields, reserving all the land suitable for planting cotton. Applying more manure to the wheat fields will also result in a good wheat harvest. We also know how to save. This winter, we also plan to develop cotton ginning and spinning as a sideline business to further improve our lives. We also discussed writing to the soldiers to let them know that the family has a good harvest, so that they don't worry about their families and can concentrate on learning technology and culture, and train to become revolutionary soldiers who are both cultured and skilled in martial arts.
　　Dear Chairman Mao: You are concerned about us every day. Under your leadership, our lives have changed. We are so grateful that we don't know how to repay your kindness. We discussed writing this letter to you, please rest assured, and wish you eternal good health.
　　All military dependents of Dongfeng Village, Wuji County, Hebei Province

### 河北省无极县东丰庄军属  联名写信报告丰收  干部热心推动代耕，并执行政府奖励植棉政策，使得光景过好了。

　　河北省无极县东丰庄军属
    联名写信报告丰收
    干部热心推动代耕，并执行政府奖励植棉政策，使得光景过好了。
    【本报讯】河北省无极县东丰庄军属以衷心感激的心情联名写信给毛主席，报告今年庄稼收成好，干部关心代耕工作，并执行了政府奖励植棉的政策，使得他们的光景过好了。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    俺们东丰庄，今年棉花丰收了。俺们二十家军属，棉花长得更强，现已摘了两喷，看样子一亩棉花能摘二百斤。俺们高兴极了。大家商议着写信告诉你，让你放心，知道我们的光景好过了。
    东丰庄有四百四十户，俺们军属二十户，共种二百四十二亩半地，其中有一百二十亩是平分时分得的好开花地（适宜种棉的地）。从来村中对军属就关心，今年春又调整了一下代耕工作，根据各家劳动力多少，适当地施行包耕、补工制，并立下合同，保证收成。村长崔混成、民政委员寇深年等干部及时的检查，并一个月开一次军属及代耕户会议，研讨改进代耕工作，进行奖励和批评。这么一来，代耕工作更推动的好啦。开春把俺们的地耕过三遍，人们都抢着给俺们送粪，像寇大头、寇三臣等，没有牲口，就用小车送，连夜把我们积的七百二十多车粪完全送到地内。村干部和妇会里，挺关心俺们，不断的到家来问问生产、生活情形。军属李文庆，去年秋才从都市回来，村里把未分下去的三间新房、四亩好地，还有三分菜畦分给他。干部和老乡们，都帮助他安家，开了活。村干部帮助俺们订了生产计划，并说：“多种棉花，准能发家。”当时俺们有些猜疑，又盘算上级从来不哄人的，工属王春姐，把除去二亩麦地外的十亩地完全种上棉花了。接着俺们把能种棉的地，也全种上棉花。村干部又忙着向供销社贷棉籽，解决了俺们棉籽困难。俺们共种了一百六十九亩半地棉花，占全部土地百分之六十九还多。其他庄稼也都按季节先后种上。棉花长出后，锄、耪、整枝、打杈都很及时。代耕户寇三顺说：“咱们尽先给军属做，人家在前方流血汗保卫咱们大家，咱们就不能让人家家里有困难。”影响的寇保秋、寇中魁、王增群三个挑皮户改过来，并要争取模范。全村代耕户，做俺们的活，都比做自己的活还要紧。一早一晚还给没劳动力的户扫院子，垫猪圈，这真使我们过意不去。
    由于村干部和代耕户的热烈帮助，俺们也不光依赖代耕。二十家共有男劳动力十八个，女劳动力七个，还有七个半劳动力（老年妇女和儿童）都参加田间生产。军属寇豆包和寇大乱等户互助起来，妇女军属石令文学会了锄、耪地。俺们在夏天和代耕户协力把地都锄过四遍，庄稼长得可不赖，尤是棉花长得可真强。棉花桃子稠的像蒜瓣似的，桃子大，花又白，一斤花到供销社去卖，可换到八九斤米，一亩棉花，就能换米六百多斤。一亩能顶四亩别的庄稼收成。石令文笑着说：“听了毛主席的话，可真富裕了，今年一年收成，三年我都吃不了。”
    秋收时，人们尽先拾掇我们的庄稼，熟一块，收一块，现谷子四十一亩、高粱十八亩都收割到家，把地也耕出来。高粱、谷子收得都不错。高粱一亩收一石五，谷子一亩收一石八。村里妇女在妇女代表曹荣身带动下，还帮助没劳力的军属掏谷子、摘棉花，军属李小元喜欢地说：“这比我儿子在家时，活还做得周到哩！”俺们没有一点困难，光景一天天上升，一家家欢天喜地。上级号召今年多留棉田，俺们也都拿定了主意，现正赶着攒粪打耙麦地，将适合种棉的地都留出来。种麦地多施几车粪，麦子也不少打。俺们更知道节省，今冬还打算开展轧花纺棉的副业，使光景更好。俺们还商议写信给战士，让他们也知道家里好收成，使他们不结记家，安心学习技术、文化，锻炼成文武双全的革命战士。
    亲爱的毛主席：你整日的关心着俺们，俺们在你领导下生活变了样，感激得我们不知怎样报答你的好处。大家商议着写给你这封信，请你放心，并祝你身体永远健康
            河北省无极县东丰庄全体军属
