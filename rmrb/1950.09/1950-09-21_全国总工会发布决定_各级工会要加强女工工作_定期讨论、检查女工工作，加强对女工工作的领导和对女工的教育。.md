Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a decision on strengthening women workers' work on September 14th. The decision pointed out that over the past year, women workers' work in trade unions has achieved results due to the correct leadership of the Party committees and trade union committees at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party. The broad masses of women workers have made great progress in production, culture, and political consciousness. However, these achievements have not kept up with the development of the entire trade union work and are far behind the needs of national production and construction. One reason is the lack of experience in women workers' work; the other is that trade union organizations at all levels do not pay enough attention to women workers' work and do not fully recognize that women workers' work is an indispensable and important part of the entire trade union work. Without doing a good job in women workers' work, the entire trade union work cannot be done well, and it will be impossible to guarantee the completion of the national production plan.

Therefore, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has decided that trade union committees at all levels should regularly discuss and inspect women workers' work, strengthen the leadership and education of women workers' work, and provide specific guidance to the women workers' departments to establish their own operations. Local trade unions and industrial trade unions at all levels must strengthen and establish the structure of the women workers' department. Its task is, on the one hand, to supervise and inspect whether all departments of the trade union organization and the various documents it issues pay attention to women workers' issues; on the other hand, it should do a few specific tasks that women workers urgently demand and can solve, such as: maternal and child hygiene, nurseries, etc. The women workers' department should closely contact the masses, wholeheartedly do these things well, and establish a system of regular inspection and summary of work.

Regarding strengthening the work of employees' families, the decision pointed out that employees plus their families equal half of the population of industrial cities. Organizing families and uniting them around the trade union plays a significant role in ensuring that employees complete their production tasks; it has extremely important political significance for consolidating the people's regime. Therefore, family work is one of the important tasks of the entire trade union and is also one of the main businesses of the trade union's women workers' department. Trade union organizations at all levels should strengthen the leadership of family work so as to basically organize the concentrated families in 1951.

Regarding the issue of cadres in the women workers' department, the decision stipulates that trade unions at all levels should allocate an appropriate proportion of cadres specifically for women workers' work according to the specific conditions of each region and the number of people separated from production, and should try to fix them in the current stage, and do not frequently transfer them or have too much mobility, so as to be familiar with the business, accumulate experience, and professionalize the work of women workers.

　　全国总工会发布决定
    各级工会要加强女工工作
    定期讨论、检查女工工作，加强对女工工作的领导和对女工的教育。
    【新华社二十日讯】中华全国总工会于九月十四日发布关于加强女工工作的决定。决定指出：一年来，工会的女工工作，由于中国共产党各级党委、各级工会委员会正确的领导，是获得了成绩的。广大的女工群众，无论在生产、文化、政治觉悟上，都有很大的进步。但是这些成绩，还赶不上整个工会工作的发展，还远落后于国家生产建设的需要。其原因一方面是由于女工工作还缺乏经验；另方面是由于各级工会组织，对女工工作不够重视，没有足够地认识女工工作是整个工会工作中不可缺少、不可忽视的一个重要部分。不把女工工作做好，整个工会工作就不能做好，就无法保证国家生产计划的完成。
    因此，全国总工会决定各级工会委员会，要定期讨论、检查女工工作，加强对女工工作的领导和对女工的教育，并具体指导女工部建立起自己的业务。各级地方工会、产业工会，均需加强和建立飘工部的机构。其任务一方面是督促、检查工会组织各个部门工作中，及其所发布的各种文件，是否注意了女工问题；另方面，应作几件女工群众迫切要求解决而可能解决的具体工作，如：妇婴卫生、托儿所等。女工部要密切联系群众，全心全意办好这几件事，并建立经常检查和总结工作的制度。
    关于加强职工家属工作，决定指出：职工加上家属等于产业城市人口之半。把家属组织起来，团结在工会周围，对保证职工完成生产任务有很大作用；对巩固人民政权，有极其重大的政治意义。因此家属工作是整个工会重要工作之一，也是工会女工部主管业务之一。各级工会组织应加强对家属工作的领导，以便在一九五一年内把集中居住的家属，基本上组织起来。
    关于女工部的干部问题，决定规定：各级工会，应根据各该地区的具体情况和脱离生产人员的数量，配备适当比例的专做女工工作的干部，并且在目前阶段应尽量固定起来，不要调动频繁，流动性太大，以便熟悉业务，积累经验，使女工工作专业化。
