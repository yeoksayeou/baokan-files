Short commentary:

    Since the promulgation and implementation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, people's governments across the country have generally been able to grasp the basic spirit of the Marriage Law and correctly handle many marriage cases. This has severely cracked down on the old feudal marriage system and basically guaranteed freedom of marriage. However, there are still many Party and government cadres, especially at the district and village levels, who, even today, do not understand that reforming the marriage system is a major event in the new China; they do not understand that this reform will inevitably encounter many stubborn obstacles; they do not understand that it should be carried out as a serious struggle task; and they have even intentionally or unintentionally become prisoners of the feudal marriage system, destroyers of the Marriage Law, and people who undermine freedom of marriage. The many letters published in this journal previously and the four letters published today all prove this point.

    The main reason for this phenomenon is that these cadres still have strong feudal residual thoughts in their minds. They cannot stand the fresh things of the new society, and they cannot stand true free marriage, just as people who are used to walking in the dark cannot stand the dazzling sun. They use various methods and excuses to obstruct freedom of marriage, and even use brute force to infringe on the personal freedom of men and women, especially women, who are striving for freedom of marriage. This is very wrong!

    We should thoroughly eliminate these erroneous thoughts and behaviors that undermine freedom of marriage. Leading organs and leading comrades at all levels should assume this important responsibility. Education is the main thing, but it is also necessary to give necessary punishments for serious wrongdoings that obstruct freedom of marriage.

### 切实保障婚姻自由

　　切实保障婚姻自由
    中华人民共和国的婚姻法公布实行以来，全国各地人民政府一般都能掌握婚姻法的基本精神正确地处理了许多婚姻案件，严重打击了旧的封建婚姻制度，基本上保障了婚姻的自由。然而各地也有不少党政干部，特别是区村干部，直到今天还不懂得改革婚姻制度是新中国的一件大事；不懂得这种改革必然会碰到许多顽强阻挠；不懂得把它当作严重的斗争任务来执行，甚至有意无意地做了封建婚姻制度的俘虏，成了婚姻法的破坏者，成了摧残婚姻自由的人。本刊以前发表的许多来信和今天发表的四封来信都证明了这一点。
    这种现象之所以发生，主要因为这些干部，头脑里还存在着浓厚的封建残余思想。他们看不惯新社会的新鲜事物，看不惯真正的自由婚姻，正如走惯了夜路的人看不惯耀眼的太阳一样。他们用各种方法和借口来阻挠婚姻的自由，甚至用蛮横的手段来侵害争取婚姻自由的男女、尤其是妇女的人身自由，这是非常不应该的！
    我们应该彻底肃清这些摧残婚姻自由的错误思想和行为，各地领导机关和领导同志应该负起这个重大的责任。教育是主要的，但对阻挠婚姻自由的严重错误行为给以必要的处分也是应该的。
