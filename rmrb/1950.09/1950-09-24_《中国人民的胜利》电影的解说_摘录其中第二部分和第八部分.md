　　Commentary on the Film "The Victory of the Chinese People"
    ——Excerpts from Parts Two and Eight
    Simonov
    Editor's Note: The color film "The Victory of the Chinese People," co-produced by the Beijing Film Studio and the Soviet Documentary Film Studio, will soon be screened simultaneously in fifteen cities across the country. At the celebration hosted by the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to mark the film's completion, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, on behalf of Chairman Mao of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, awarded a certificate of merit to Comrade Varlamov, the Soviet director of the film. At the celebration held by the Ministry of Culture to mark the film's completion, Comrade Varlamov said: "This film marks the first practical collaboration between the cultural workers of the People's Republic of China and the cultural workers of the Soviet Union." Minister Shen Yanbing said: "In the history of our cinema, this is the first color documentary with great political and educational significance and a high artistic standard. It reflects the heroic and skillful fighting of the People's Liberation Army, the earth-shattering heroic historical feats of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Self-Defense, and the final victory achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" When it is screened, we will see those great historical events re-enacted before our eyes, and at the same time we will hear a concise, magnificent, solemn, and vivid commentary, which is the explanation for this film made by the Soviet writer Comrade Simonov. This explanation is complete, compact, and coherent from beginning to end. The entire explanation has ten parts. We are now publishing parts two and eight here: Part two describes the past difficult life of the Chinese working people and the Communist Party's flag flying from Jinggang Mountain to Yan'an; part eight describes crossing the Yangtze River and liberating Nanjing.
  Part Two
    I. China has now finally become a unified and free great nation.
    II. Our natural resources are countless: we have rich mineral deposits, we have fertile and vast fields, we have great rivers.
    III. In our north and west, we are connected to the great Soviet Union.
    IV. In our south are Siam, Burma, and Vietnam.
    V. In our east is the Pacific Ocean.
    VI. Here is the starting point of the Great Wall.
    This wall has historically defended against foreign invasions, but in the last hundred years, it has not been able to prevent imperialists from rushing into China from land and sea. From that time on, imperialism colluded with feudal forces and became the masters of China.
    VII. China is a country with a long culture, China has countless magnificent ancient sites and amazing artistic creations, all created by the hardworking and talented Chinese people through untold hardships.
    VIII. These dragons on the Nine-Dragon Wall in Beihai symbolize the changing of dynasties, and in each dynasty, countless palaces were built.
    IX. Palaces… were built with the blood and sweat of the working people. Look! The lives of the working people were like cattle and horses, the same thousands of years ago, the same a hundred years ago, and the same five years ago.
    X. This is how the farmers tilled the land for the landlords.
    XI. This is how the farmers planted rice seedlings, irrigating the fields with every drop of sweat.
    XII. This is how women labored arduously… with children tied to their backs like sacks.
    XIII. People pulled tow ropes with their shoulders and hands with such difficulty.
    XIV. In that era when sweat and tears were worth nothing, the Chinese people labored in this way.
    XV. Shanghai – this is a city of sin and exploitation…
    XVI. In ports where hundreds and thousands of ships come and go, there are no good modern loading and unloading facilities, because here, people's labor is worth less than nothing.
    XVII. Rickshaw pullers… they have no homes. They run in the streets all day, summer and winter, and sleep next to their wheels at night, but even these wheels do not belong to them, but to the owner.
    XVIII. Bitter life… sleeping on the ground!
    At that time, the common people did not even own a place to stand.
    Hundreds and thousands of people live on the water, they work day and night without getting a full meal. They are born on the water, suffer on the water, and die on the water.
    The life of the Chinese working people has fallen to extreme poverty and misery.
    In China, the common people only have one right left, and that is to sell their labor for a few cents.
    China's land, China's cities, do not belong to the Chinese people…
    XIX. "This house belongs to America!"
    XX. But this woman only has three hungry children.
    XXI. "This house belongs to England!"
    XXII. "Belongs to Belgium"…
    XXIII. "Belongs to the Netherlands"…
    XXIV. "Belongs to Sweden"…
    XXV. "Belongs to England again"…
    XXVI. "Belongs to America again"…
    XXVII. As for the real Chinese people, the Chinese patriots, what do they own? That is the barbed wire, bunkers and machine gun nests in the foreign concessions…
    XXVIII. Imperialists – built prisons on Chinese soil to help the Kuomintang executioners suppress the Chinese people.
    XXIX. Look! This is the flag of the Kuomintang reactionaries – Chiang Kai-shek's flag, a flag of betraying the motherland.
    XXX. But in the skies of China, in the hearts of the Chinese people, another flag is flying, the flag of revolution, the flag of the Communist Party!
    XXXI. This is Jinggang Mountain: Since Chiang Kai-shek colluded with imperialism and betrayed the people in 1927, after the failure of the Great Revolution, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu met here in 1928. The Chinese Communist Party organized the first batch of Workers' and Peasants' Red Army here and established China's earliest democratic government.
    XXXII. Ruijin, the capital of the Chinese Red Area, Chairman Mao led the Red Army here to fight and crushed the Kuomintang's four encirclement and suppression campaigns.
    XXXIII. These places are sacred in the memory of every Communist…
    The auditorium of the First National Congress of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, destroyed by Kuomintang bandits.
    XXXIV. From this place, the People's Liberation Army began the heroic 25,000-li Long March to the north.
    XXXV. After countless hardships, crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands, fighting and replenishing the ranks, advancing bravely!
    XXXVI. The mountains of northern Shaanxi – eagles soaring in the sky.
    XXXVII. Yan'an – the fortress and lighthouse of the Chinese revolution.
    XXXVIII. The People's Liberation Army arrived in the Yan'an area in 1935.
    XXXIX. Yan'an has since become the leading center for resisting Japanese imperialist aggression.
    XL. The Chinese peasants warmly support the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
    XLI. Struggle requires not only courage, but also knowledge, so people here study tenaciously, and here they established the Red University. The school trains cadres in preparation for the struggle.
    XLII. Patriotic people who are determined to fight for China's freedom and independence gather here from all directions.
    XLIII. Chairman Mao led the anti-Japanese struggle from Yan'an.
    XLIV. The Yan'an headquarters commanded tens of thousands of guerrilla units in the Northeast to fight the enemy.
  Part Eight
    I. According to the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the People's Liberation Army began crossing the river before dawn on the 21st.
    II. What you are seeing now is just one of the many crossing points.
    III. At the same time, from Jiangyin in the east to Jiujiang in the west, across a thousand miles of the Yangtze River, a million soldiers attacked the enemy like a storm.
    IV. Look! These wooden boats. These are the wooden boats of the people on the banks of the river. They use the boats to transport their troops for the river crossing operation.
    On the boats, together with the soldiers, are young people, children, and mothers… They want to personally send the soldiers to the south bank.
    V. The first batch of Kuomintang planes appeared.
    VI. The Kuomintang artillery fired from the south bank, trying to prevent the troops from crossing the river.
    VII. The river here is ten li wide, and it takes a lot of time to cross it by sail and oars.
    VIII. The closer to the riverbank, the more difficult it becomes.
    IX. But the Liberation Army suppressed the enemy with powerful artillery fire from the north bank.
    X. These are the first heroes to cross the river.
    XI. Occupied the initial piece of land on the south bank.
    XII. Advance! Consolidate the first bridgehead.
    XIII. Continue advancing immediately without wasting a second!
    XIV. At this time, dozens of such bridgeheads have been occupied on the thousand-mile Yangtze River front. The soldiers are shooting at the still resisting enemy from the water.
    XV. The Yangtze River defense line boasted by the enemy was shattered.
    XVI. Amphibious vehicles overtake the rowing sailboats and go straight to the south bank.
    XVII. Subsequent troops are continuously crossing the river to reinforce the operation.
    XVIII. The people's artillery turned their fire to the enemy's rear, bombarding and destroying the enemy's command organs, rear supply lines, and transportation links.
    XIX. The banner of victory is planted on the south bank of the Yangtze River.
    XX. Countless troops continue to advance south. The Yangtze River is far behind them. Ahead are Nanjing and Shanghai.
    XXI. Issue new calls to the soldiers, not allowing the enemy to catch their breath, not allowing the enemy to gain a foothold.
    This means: ruthlessly clearing away all resistance on the road ahead.
    We need to advance quickly… this is not enough!
    We need to advance even faster, this is still not enough!
    Running forward kilometer after kilometer!… We must seize every second to bring victory quickly.
    XXII. Wounded commanders and fighters in the river crossing operation are also carried forward. They want to see the liberation of Nanjing with their own eyes.
    XXIII. Guerrillas in southern Jiangsu run down from the mountains on all sides to join forces with the People's Liberation Army.
    XXIV. But time is precious. After a long separation, the reunion can only last for a minute.
    The soldiers hurry forward, not having time to speak, leaving these simple slogans to the people.
    XXV. Now there is only one goal in front of the army: advance, advance to Nanjing!
    XXVI. The armed workers of Pukou occupied the most important railway ferry on the Yangtze River.
    XXVII. The road to Nanjing is open.
    XXVIII. Look! This is the presidential palace of Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor of the people, the running dog of the United States, and the executioner.
    XXIX. Look! This is the lair of the enemy of the people.
    XXX. Not long ago, Chiang Kai-shek swore here that he would rather commit suicide than give up Nanjing.
    XXXI. Look! Right on this podium, he swore that he would not rest in peace until he eliminated the Communist Party.
    XXXII. April 22nd was the day the traitors fled, the day the Liberation Army arrived.
    XXXIII. Soldiers walk through the liberated streets of Nanjing…
    XXXIV. They walk to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.
    XXXV. Armed people commemorate the great democratic revolutionary, who did not live to see this bright day, did not live to see the victory of the Chinese revolution.
    But he once believed, believed in this victory. The people remember his dying words:
    "I wish to express my fervent hope that dawn is about to break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a friend and ally…"

    西蒙诺夫
    编者按：北京电影制片厂与苏联文献电影制片厂联合摄制的五彩片《中国人民的胜利》不久将在全国十五城市同时放映。在中国人民解放军总部庆祝此片摄制完成的晚会上，朱总司令代表中国人民革命军事委员会毛主席授予这部影片的苏联导演瓦尔拉莫夫同志以奖状。在文化部庆祝这部影片摄制完成的大会上，瓦尔拉莫夫同志说：“这部片子，是中华人民共和国文艺工作者与苏联的文艺工作者第一次的实际合作。”沈雁冰部长说：“在我们电影史上，这是第一部具有伟大的政治教育意义和高度的艺术水准的五彩纪录片。它反映了人民解放军的英勇善战，反映了抗日战争和自卫战争的惊天动地的英勇史迹，反映了中国人民在共产党和毛主席领导之下艰苦斗争取得了最后的胜利！”等到上演时，我们将要看到那些伟大的史迹一幕一幕地在面前重现，同时我们还会听到简洁，雄壮，严肃而生动的解说，这就是苏联作家西蒙诺夫同志为这部影片所作的说明。这说明从开端到结尾是完整的，紧凑的，一气呵成的。全部说明，共有十部分，现在我们把里边的第二部分和第八部分在这里发表：第二部分写中国劳动人民过去困苦的生活和共产党的旗帜从井岗山飘扬到延安；第八部分写横渡长江和解放南京。
  第二部分
    一、中国现在终于成为一个统一和自由的伟大的国家了。
    二、我们的天然富源是数不尽的：我们有丰富的矿藏，我们有肥沃辽阔的田野，我们有巨大的河流。
    三、在我们的北方和西方，与伟大苏联相连接。
    四、在我们的南方，是暹罗缅甸和越南。
    五、在我们的东方是太平洋。
    六、这里是万里长城的起点。
    这座城墙在历史上曾经防御了异族的侵略，但是近百年来它并不能阻止帝国主义者从陆地和海洋上冲入中国，从那个时候起，帝国主义与封建势力勾结，俨然变成为中国的主人。
    七、中国是一个有悠久文化的国家，中国有无数雄伟的古迹，和惊人的艺术创造品，这都是由爱劳动和有才能的中国人民，千辛万苦创造出来的。
    八、北海九龙壁上的这些龙，象征着各个朝代的更换，并且在每一个朝代里，都建筑了无数的宫殿。
    九、宫殿……是用劳动人民血汗筑造的。看！劳动人民的生活，像牛像马一样，几千年前是这样，一百年前是这样，五年前也是这样。
    十、农民们就这样，为地主耕种。
    十一、农民们就是这样，一棵苗一滴汗引水种田。
    十二、妇女们就是这样艰苦劳动着……小孩像口袋一样地捆在脊背上。
    十三、人们这样艰苦地用肩和手拉着纤绳。
    十四、在汗水跟眼泪都一样不值钱的那个时代里，中国老百姓就这样劳作着。
    十五、上海——这是一个罪恶的剥削的城市……
    十六、在成百成千的轮船来往的港口上，没有很好的近代化的卸货设备，因为这里人的劳动力是比什么都不值钱的。
    十七、人力车夫……他们没有家，他们不论夏天，冬天，整天跑在街头，夜晚就睡在自己的车轮旁，可是就连这些车轮子也不属于他们，而是属于主人的。
    十八、辛酸的生活……睡在地面上！
    那时候老百姓连一片站脚的地方也不属于自己的了。
    成百成千的人，住在水面上，他们日夜奔忙，得不到一顿饱饭，他们就这样生在水面上，磨折在水面上，死在水面上。
    中国劳动人民的生活，降落到极度贫困和悲惨的地步了。
    在中国，老百姓，只剩下了一种权利，这就是为了几分钱去出卖自己的劳动力。
    中国的土地，中国的城市，并不属于中国人民的……
    十九、“此房为美国所有！”
    二十、可是这个女人只有三个饥饿的孩子。
    二一、“此房为英国所有！”
    二二、“比利时所有”……
    二三、“荷兰所有”……
    二四、“瑞典所有”……
    二五、“又是英国所有”……
    二六、“又是美国所有”……
    二七、至于真正的中国人民，中国的爱国者，他们所有的是什么呢？那就是外国租界上带刺的铁丝网，炮垒和机关枪枪眼……
    二八、帝国主义者——在中国土地上，造起监狱，帮助国民党刽子手镇压中国人民。
    二九、看！这就是国民党反动派——蒋介石的旗子，这是叛卖祖国的旗子。
    三十、可是在中国的上空，在中国人民的心里飘扬着的是另一面旗帜，革命的旗帜，共产党的旗帜！
    三一、这是井岗山：自从一九二七年蒋介石勾结帝国主义，背叛人民，大革命失败后，一九二八年毛主席与朱总司令在这里会合了，中国共产党在这里组织了第一批工农红军，创立了中国最早的民主政府。
    三二、中国红色区域的首都——瑞金，毛主席在这里领导红军作战，粉碎了国民党的四次围剿。
    三三、这些地方在每一个共产党员的记忆中都是神圣的……
    国民党匪徒炸毁的中国第一次工农兵代表大会的礼堂。
    三四、人民解放军，从此地开始了向北方的英勇的二万五千里长征。
    三五、经过了无数坚难困苦，越过了雪山草地，一边战斗一边补充，勇往前进！
    三六、陕北的山岭——雄鹰在上空飞翔。
    三七、延安——中国革命的堡垒和灯塔。
    三八、人民解放军于一九三五年到达了延安地区。
    三九、延安从此成为反对日本帝国主义侵略的领中导心。
    四十、中国的农民们，热烈的拥护中国共产党的领导。
    四一、斗争不仅需要勇敢，而且需要知识，因此人们在这里顽强地学习着，在这里创办了红色大学。学校里锻炼着准备从事斗争的干部。
    四二、决心为中国的自由与独立而斗争的爱国志士们，从四面八方汇集到这里来。
    四三、毛主席从延安领导着抗日斗争。
    四四、延安总部指挥着东北成千成万的游击部队同敌人作战。
  第八部分
    一、根据毛主席、朱总司令命令人民解放军于二十一日黎明前开始渡江。
    二、现在你所看到的，只是许多渡口中的一个渡口。
    三、在同一时间里，东起江阴西到九江，在千里长江上，百万雄师如同暴风雨一样，向敌人进攻了。
    四、看！这些木船。这是江边老百姓的木船，他们用船来运送自己的渡江作战的部队。
    在船上和战士们在一起的，有青年人，有孩子和母亲们……他们要亲自把战士们送到南岸。
    五、国民党第一批飞机出现了。
    六、国民党炮兵，从南岸发射炮火，妄想阻止部队过江。
    七、这里的江面有十里地宽，要靠帆和桨横渡过去，是需要许多时间。
    八、江岸离得愈近，困难也就更多了。
    九、可是解放军从北岸发出强大炮火压制了敌人。
    十、这是第一批渡江的英雄。
    十一、占领了南岸最初的一片土地。
    十二、前进！巩固了第一个桥头阵地。
    十三、立刻不浪费一秒钟，继续前进！
    十四、在千里长江的前线上，这时候，已经占领了几十个这样的桥头阵地。战士们从水面上射击还在抵抗的敌人。
    十五、敌人所吹嘘的长江防线粉碎了。
    十六、水陆两用交通工具，赶过摇橹的帆船，直通南岸。
    十七、后续部队，源源不断地开过江去增援作战。
    十八、人民的炮兵，把炮火转向敌人纵深猛轰，轰毁敌人的指挥机关，后方供应线和交通联络。
    十九、胜利的旗帜插在长江南岸上。
    二十、无数万大军继续南进，长江已经远远落在他们的身后了，前面是南京和上海。
    二一、向战士们发出新的号召，不让敌人喘息，不让敌人站住脚步。
    这就是说：无情地扫清前进道路上的一切抵抗。
    我们需要很快的前进……这还不够！
    需要更快的前进，这也还不够！
    一公里又一公里的跑步前进！……我们要抓住每一秒钟时间，让胜利迅速地到来。
    二二、渡江作战负伤的指战员，也抬着前进，他们要亲眼看见南京的解放。
    二三、江南的游击队，从四面的山上跑下来和人民解放军会师。
    二四、但是时间是珍贵的，长期的分离，现在相会只能有一分钟的时间。
    战士们急忙前进，来不及讲话，把这些简单的标语留给老百姓。
    二五、现在在大军面前只有一个目的：前进，向南京前进！
    二六、浦口的武装工人，占领了长江最重要的铁路渡口。
    二七、向南京的道路打开了。
    二八、看！这就是人民叛徒，美国的走狗刽子手，蒋介石的总统府。
    二九、看！这就是人民公敌的巢穴。
    三十、不久以前，蒋介石还在这里发誓，他宁愿自杀也不愿放弃南京。
    三一、看！就在这个讲台上，他发誓不消灭共产党死不瞑目。
    三二、四月二十二日，是叛徒们逃跑的日子，是解放军来到的日子。
    三三、战士们走过解放了的南京的大街……
    三四、他们走上中山陵。
    三五、武装的人民纪念伟大的民主主义革命者，他没有能活到这个光明的日子，没有活到中国革命胜利的日子。
    可是他曾经相信，相信过这个胜利，人民记得他临终前的话：
    “我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时，苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国……”
