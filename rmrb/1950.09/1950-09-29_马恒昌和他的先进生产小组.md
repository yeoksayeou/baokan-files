　　Ma Hengchang and His Advanced Production Team
    The Ma Hengchang production team of the Shenyang No. 5 Machine Factory is hailed as the banner of advanced production teams in Northeast China. Their experience is being studied by workers all over the country. From April of last year to February of this year, the Ma Hengchang team completed their production tasks ahead of schedule every month. Of the original ten members, eight produced no rejects throughout the year, seven set new records ten times, and they improved eighteen kinds of tools. The team has repeatedly been commended for its achievements.
    In our industrial production, the transition from the old state of irresponsibility, chaotic systems, backward technology, substandard products, and low efficiency to the establishment of responsibility, mastery of technology, guaranteed quality, and improved efficiency is a great historical change. Looking at the production team at the lowest level, the Ma Hengchang team has created valuable experience in this regard and opened up a path for how grassroots trade unions can lead mass production. But how were these things created and produced?
  Truly Became Masters
    Ma Hengchang is an old worker who has worked for twenty-seven years. In the past, everyone knew that he was honest, buried himself in his work, and didn't care much about others. After liberation, he often heard people say, "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao have led the workers to stand up, and the workers are the masters of the country!" Ma Hengchang thought, "In the past few decades, dynasties have changed, and workers have never been treated as human beings. Is it really different this time?" So he always paid attention to observing various changes. Ma Hengchang recalled that the factory directors in the past all exploited the workers, drew salaries for doing nothing, lived in big buildings, rode in cars, and only made a brief appearance at the factory once a day; at that time, workers were not fed or clothed adequately, and if they worked slowly, they were either beaten or sent to the military police. But what about the current factory director? His food, clothing, and housing are similar to those of the workers. He works very hard all day long and often asks the workers questions, and is very kind and friendly to everyone. One day, Ma Hengchang made a special trip to the factory director's dormitory and saw that the factory director's children were not dressed any better than the workers' children. They lived in one room with a small coal stove that was constantly smoking. Ma Hengchang thought, why is he, a factory director, suffering like this? Doesn't he know how to enjoy himself? Because of this, he also talked to his fellow worker Zhu Puqing, he said: "Who do you think the Communist Party is working for?" Zhu Puqing said, "I think it's for everyone." They both thought the same thing. Ma Hengchang felt that the working class had indeed stood up and become the masters.
  "Our Materials Are Scarcer Than Gold and Silver, and Should Never Be Wasted Casually!"
    Ma Hengchang had a real ideological awakening and was always thinking about how to do his job well. Several other people in the team were the same as him. Zhao Lianke always wanted to repay the favor because his family had been given land. When donating materials, he had nothing to donate, so he worked hard and was commended for his merits; Xu Jingrong had suffered the most in the past, and after liberation, he worked actively, even running to the toilet. In April of last year, the factory received a batch of work, and Ma Hengchang worked while ill, and no one could persuade him to rest. He thought: "If I don't make any contribution to the country, I won't stop working even if I die!"
    In May of last year, the factory launched a competition. At this time, many people were pursuing quantity in order to exceed their tasks and win red flags, but few paid attention to quality, and piles and piles of defective products were produced. Originally, producing defective products while working had become a common occurrence when workers were forced to work as slaves for others. However, Ma Hengchang's thinking had awakened, and at this time it was different. He saw that these defective products wasted the people's property and everyone's blood and sweat, and he felt more and more uncomfortable, and felt that it was really wrong. Ma Hengchang discussed with everyone in the team to reduce defective products. He said, "We are currently so difficult, and materials are simply scarcer than gold and silver, and should never be wasted casually!" The team's activists, Zhu Puqing, Xu Jingrong, Zhao Lianke, and others, also had this idea in their hearts. After he said this, everyone became clearer, so everyone studied how to avoid producing defective products.
    To do a good job, you must first pay attention to technology. But when it comes to learning technology, for many years, everyone has had a kind of conservative thinking: they are unwilling to pass on their technical experience to others, and they are also unwilling for others to point out their faults, for fear of wage cuts and losing their jobs, and for fear of losing face. So they researched and improved technology while dispelling everyone's conservative ideas.
    They decided to use the twenty minutes of lunchtime for cultural study to study technology, calling it the "Technical Research Association." They first study the drawings to see if there are any errors and what the key points are. After everyone's detailed research, the finished product can have fewer problems and be made quickly and well.
    In order to further eliminate defective products, they inspected each item when the first one was made. They would only continue to make it if it met the specifications, and if it did not meet the specifications, they would find the reason and try to correct it. This is called "Checking the First Item."
    In order to better exchange experience, they formed three-person mutual aid groups with lathes close together, discussed problems at any time, and often studied operating techniques together. Each group set plans, launched competitions, supervised each other, and conducted summary inspections at the end of the month.
    They also taught apprentices and helped new workers with an extremely responsible attitude. In December of last year, the factory expanded production. The Ma Hengchang team had more lathes, and only three of the original old workers were left, and nineteen new workers were added. They conscientiously took on the task of helping the new workers, both to ensure that no defective products were produced and to ensure that the apprentices could be taught well in three months and be able to work independently on the machines. Their method of teaching apprentices was not to leave them alone, nor was it to prevent them from working on the machines for fear of producing defective products. They let the apprentices "watch and do," and the masters explained patiently at any time; in order to save materials, they initially used iron instead of wind steel. After the apprentices became slightly familiar, they worked on the machines to remove the rough edges.
    Because they worked hard to study technology and improve tools and working methods, production efficiency continued to improve. Gao Hongru made spiral wash bearings, changing from using one tool to using seven tools, increasing efficiency by eight times; Liu Yupu made the crankshaft on the inspection machine, and worked with Ma Hengchang to make a clip and press it on the machine, increasing efficiency by 50%; when they made pulleys, the original three procedures of turning, spinning, and drilling were done by one person. Later, following the assembly line method, they were divided into several parts, which shortened the time from one and a half hours to forty minutes. Similar improvements often appeared in the team. The whole team improved eighteen kinds of tools, and Ma Hengchang alone improved four kinds. Therefore, they have long ensured that no defective products are produced, and they complete their tasks ahead of schedule every month. They once completed two months' tasks in twenty-five days.
  "Everyone Works Together, Everyone Eats Together, We Are the Masters and Everyone Should Be Responsible!"
    Of course, the fact that the Ma Hengchang team was able to grow like this is inseparable from the leadership and help of the Party, government, trade union, and the Youth League, the conscious efforts of all the workers in the team, and the influence of the entire environment.
    Trade union cadre Comrade Wang Jinping has often come to the Ma Hengchang team to solve various problems, give encouragement and support, for more than a year. Especially since September of last year, in the vigorous New Record Movement launched throughout Northeast China, due to the emergence of new records by the Ma Hengchang team, it influenced the workers of the entire factory, enabling the factory to complete two months' tasks in one month and seven days. In turn, the factory management committee launched the Bai Changshu team in the factory to challenge the Ma Hengchang team to seize the red flag. The Bai team often sent people to the Ma team to learn from their experience and understand the situation, which made the entire team of Ma Hengchang very nervous. Everyone was determined and said, "The better we are, the better we must be!" Ma Hengchang said, "We all work together, we all eat together, we are the masters and everyone should be responsible!" Everyone further divided the work, and set up safety, entertainment, sanitation, labor protection and other cadres in the team, each responsible for their duties, and doing what they said. Ma Hengchang inspected production, some wiped the lathes, some checked the switches and fire prevention, and some taught culture and sang songs. The internal unity was even more consistent, and it completely became a fighting advanced production team. (Attached picture)

　　马恒昌和他的先进生产小组
    沈阳第五机器厂马恒昌生产小组，在东北被誉为先进生产小组的旗帜。他们的经验为全国各地的工人所学习。马恒昌小组从去年四月到今年二月，月月提前完成生产任务，全组原有十个人，八个人全年没出废品，七个人创造过十次新纪录，共改进了十八种工具，全组曾一再立功。
    在我们的工业生产上，从旧的无人负责、制度混乱、技术落后、产品低劣、效率低下的状况，到建立责任、掌握技术、保证质量、提高效率，是一个伟大的历史性的改变。从最下层的生产小组来看，马恒昌小组在这方面创造了宝贵的经验，并为基层工会如何领导群众生产开辟了道路。但这些是怎么创造和产生的呢？
  确实作了主人了
    马恒昌是一个作过二十七年工的老工人，在过去，大家都知道他老实、埋头干活，不大管别人的事。解放以后，他常听人说：“共产党毛主席领导工人翻了身，工人是国家的主人了！”马恒昌想：“过去几十年，改朝换代，从来不把工人当人看，这回真的就不同了吗？”于是他时时留心的观察各种变化。马恒昌回想起过去的厂长，个个是剥削工人，吃空饷，自己住大楼，坐汽车，一天到工厂溜一趟，从来不到现场；那时候当工人吃不饱、穿不暖，干活慢了轻则挨打，重则送宪兵队。但是他看看现在的厂长呢？吃的、穿的、住的和工人差不多，一天工作十分辛苦，常向工人问这问那，对大家十分亲热和气。有一天马恒昌特地跑到厂长的宿舍看了看，厂长的孩子穿的也不比工人的孩子强，住着一间屋子，还生着一个小煤炉子直冒烟。马恒昌就想，他是一个厂长为什么这样吃苦呢？难道他不懂得享福吗？为这，他还和工友祝普庆谈过，他说：“你看共产党是为谁干的？”祝普庆说：“我看是为大伙。”他俩完全想到一块去了。马恒昌感到，工人阶级确实是翻身作主人了。
  “咱们的材料比金银还缺，决不可随便浪费！”
    马恒昌有了真正的思想觉悟，总想着怎么样把活干好。组里还有几个人也和他一样。赵连科因为家里分了地，总想报报恩，在献器材时他没有的献，就使劲干活立了功；徐景荣过去受的苦最深，解放后他积极干活，连去厕所都是跑步。去年四月，厂里来了一批活，马恒昌带病干活，谁劝他也不休息。他想：“对国家没有什么贡献，累死也不歇工！”
    去年五月，厂里发动竞赛。这时有很多人为着超任务，争红旗，一个劲追求数量，却很少顾到质量，成堆成堆的出产废品。本来，干活出废品，这是工人被迫作奴隶给人干活时，已成了习以为常的事。但是，马恒昌思想有了觉悟，这时就不同了，他看见这些废活浪费了人民的财产和大家的血汗，心里一次比一次难受，觉得实在不对。马恒昌在组里开会时就和大家商量减少废品。他说：“咱们目前这么困难，材料简直比金银还缺，决不该随便浪费！”组里的积极分子祝普庆、徐景荣、赵连科等人，心里也有这样的意思，经他这一说大家更明确了，于是大家就研究如何作到不出废品。
    要做好活必得先讲究技术。但提起学习技术，多少年来，大家都有一种保守思想：不愿把自己的技术经验传给别人，也不愿别人指点自己的毛病，怕减薪丢饭碗，怕面子不好看。于是他们一面研究改进技术，一面打通大家的保守思想。
    他们决定利用中午二十分钟学文化的时间学习技术，叫它为“技术研究会”。他们首先研究图纸，看看有无错误，要点何在，经过大家详细的研究，就可使成品少出毛病，做得又快又好。
    为了进一步消灭废品，他们每件东西在做出头一个活时，均经大家检查，合规格才继续做，不合规格就找出原因，设法改正，这叫做“检查头一个活”。
    他们为更好的交换经验，把靠在一起的车床组成三人互助小组，遇问题随时商量，经常在一起研究操作技术。各组都订计划，展开竞赛，互相督促，月终进行总结检查。
    他们还以极负责的态度教徒弟，帮助新工友。去年十二月，厂里生产扩大。马恒昌组车床增多，原有老工友调的只剩下三个人，另增加十九名新工友。他们就认真地担负起帮助新工友的任务，既要保证不出废活，又要保证三个月教好徒弟能上机器独立工作。他们教徒弟的方法不是放手不管，也不是因怕出废活就不让徒弟上机器，他们是让徒弟“边看，边做”，师傅随时耐心解释；为了节省材料，开始时以铁代风钢，徒弟稍为熟悉后，就上机器剥荒。
    由于他们努力钻研技术，改进工具和工作方法，生产效率就不断提高。高洪儒作螺旋洗轴承，由用一把刀改用七把刀，效率提高八倍；柳玉璞做检查机上的拐轴，和马恒昌研究，做了一个卡子按在机器上，提高效率百分之五十；他们作塔轮，原来车、旋、钻三道手续由一个人作，后来仿照流水作业法，分成几部分来作，就把一点半钟作一个缩短为四十分钟。类似这样的改进，经常在组里出现，他们全组曾改进了十八种工具，马恒昌一人就改进了四种。所以，他们长期保证不出废品，月月提前完成任务，曾以二十五天完成了两个月任务。
  “活是大家干，饭是大家吃，咱们是主人就应当人人负责！”
    当然，马恒昌小组所以能这样成长起来，和党政工团对他们的领导与帮助，和全组工友自觉的努力以及整个环境的影响是分不开的。
    工会干部王金平同志，一年多以来经常到马恒昌小组解决各种问题，给以鼓励和支持。特别是自去年九月，在全东北所展开的轰轰烈烈的新纪录运动中，由于马恒昌小组新纪录的出现，影响了全厂工友，使该厂以一个月零七天完成了两个月的任务。反过来，工厂管委会又发动厂里的白常恕组向马恒昌组挑战夺红旗，白组经常派人到马组吸取经验，了解情况，使马恒昌全班人马十分紧张。大家齐下决心说：“我们越好，越要好！”马恒昌说：“咱们活是大家干，饭是大家吃，我们是主人就应当人人负责任！”大家进一步分工，在组内设立了安全、文娱、卫生、劳保等各种干事，各负专责，说到那儿办到那儿，马恒昌检查生产，有的擦洗车床，有的检查电门、防火，有的教文化、唱歌，内部更加团结一致，完全变成了一个战斗的先进的生产小组。（附图片）
