　　Algeria's Youth Movement
　　Interview with Algerian Representative Kelaba
　　Algeria is a Muslim nation in North Africa. In 1830, French imperialists, relying on superior weapons, occupied it and turned it into a colony.

　　Living under a century of oppression by imperialism, the Algerian people are in a very tragic situation. They originally used Arabic script, but French imperialism deprived them of this freedom and forced them to write in French and speak French. Schools are scarce. Among 1.5 million children, more than 90 percent are out of school. Nutrition and sanitation are also shockingly bad. The country's population of nine million has only 18,000 hospital beds, an average of one doctor for every 50,000 people. Therefore, the infant mortality rate for children under three is 50 percent, meaning that one out of every two children dies. The working class (mostly agricultural workers) work up to sixteen hours a day and are often bought and sent to Vietnam to fight the Vietnamese People's Army by French imperialism for three US dollars per kilogram, like livestock. Such inhumane oppression, accumulated over time, has bred indelible hatred in the hearts of the Algerian people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they have waged a heroic and arduous anti-imperialist struggle.

　　From 1948, in order to curry favor with American imperialism, French imperialism secretly lent Algeria's ports, which could be used as naval, land and air bases, to the United States. When the Algerian people saw the insidious American imperialism building a highway from Morocco to Tunisia solely for transporting military supplies, and saw them using large flocks of sheep as bomb test subjects, they could no longer contain their anger. Dockworkers were the first to strike, preventing the United States from shipping even a single bullet. In this strike, the Algerian people across the country supported them. The US imperialists tried to smuggle goods through a small town, but were met with the workers' ruthless refusal.

　　Currently, 500,000 people in Algeria have signed the petition to defend world peace. These 500,000 signatures were collected under the surveillance and persecution of imperialism. Therefore, it is of profound significance. This signature campaign currently has the largest number of participants from any colonial country.

　　The Algerian people, like all peace-loving people around the world, support the Korean people's just war against US imperialism with the greatest sympathy, and watch their victory with the greatest concern. Because the Korean people's struggle today is the best model for their actions tomorrow.

　　Kelaba is a 24-year-old youth, secretary of the Algerian Democratic Youth League, and one of the leaders of the Algerian Communist Party. The Algerian Democratic Youth League is an organization that the Communist Party uses to educate young people in the spirit of internationalism. The members are all outstanding young people who play a significant role in the struggle under the leadership of the Party. Talking about his personal history of struggle, Kelaba said that it was not because he himself was so great, but that his responsibility made him do a little more work. On February 21st of this year, three youth representatives from France, Vietnam, and Syria representing the World Federation of Democratic Youth visited Algeria. This day is a day of struggle for young people around the world to support young people in colonial countries. Kelaba, as a member of the WFDY council and a youth worker in Algeria, accompanied these three young people for 5,000 kilometers, visited 25 cities, met countless young people, raised all kinds of questions, and exchanged many opinions. Finally, they unanimously shouted the slogan of defending world peace. As a result, he was hated by the imperialists. As soon as the delegation left, he was arrested and imprisoned for two months. The judges who interrogated him were all specially transferred from Vietnam by the French. It was not until July 5th that, with the support of young people around the world, he forced the French imperialists to restore his freedom. Speaking of this, he said: "I also thank the Chinese youth. You also sent letters of protest to Algeria."

　　Talking about his impressions of the new China, he said that in the Northeast, he saw workers working so enthusiastically, learning culture, saw farmers with land and houses, and children going to school, everyone with smiles on their faces. He said that the victory of the Chinese people gave unlimited encouragement to colonial countries, and the friendship of the Chinese people gave them the support of 450 million people. They will certainly learn from the experience of the Chinese people's revolution and strive to build an Algerian People's Republic like the People's Republic of China. (Attached picture)

### 阿尔及利亚的青年运动  访问阿尔及利亚代表克拉巴

　　阿尔及利亚的青年运动
    访问阿尔及利亚代表克拉巴
    阿尔及利亚是非洲北部的一个信回教的民族，一八三○年法国帝国主义者凭着优越的武器占领了它，把它变成了殖民地。
    在帝国主义百年来压榨下生活着的阿尔及利亚人民的处境是非常悲惨的。他们本来是使用阿拉伯文字的民族，但是，法国帝国主义剥夺了他们这种自由，强迫他们写法文，说法国话。学校少得可怜，在一百五十万小孩当中，有百分之九十以上是失学儿童。营养和环境卫生也都惊人的坏，全境九百万人口中只有一万八千个病床，平均合五万个人一个医生，所以，三岁以下的婴儿死亡率是百分之五十，这就是说，平均两个孩子当中一定要死一个。工人阶级（多半是农业工人）每天工作多到十六小时，而且时常被法国帝国主义用三块美金一斤的价格，像买牲口似的收买送到越南去打越南的人民军。这样日积月累的非人的压迫，使阿尔及利亚的人民心中滋长着不可磨灭的仇恨，在共产党的领导下，他们进行了英勇的艰苦的反帝斗争。
    一九四八年起，法国帝国主义为了献媚美国帝国主义，秘密地把阿尔及利亚可供海陆空根据地的港口都借给美国使用了。当阿尔及利亚的人民看见心怀叵测的美国帝国主义，从摩洛哥到突尼斯修了一条专运军火的公路，又看见他们用大批的羊群当作炸弹试验品时，他们再也忍不住心中的愤怒了，码头工人首先罢工，使美国运不来一颗子弹。在这次罢工运动中，阿尔及利亚全国人民都支持他们，美帝妄想利用一个小城偷运，结果，也遭到工人们无情的拒绝。
    现在，阿尔及利亚已有五十万人在保卫世界和平的签名书上写下了自己的名字。这五十万人的签名，是在帝国主义的监视和迫害下进行的。因此，它具有深刻意义。这个签名在目前，是殖民地国家人数最多的。
    对朝鲜人民和美帝进行的正义战争，阿尔及利亚人民也和全世界爱好和平的人民一样，用最大的同情来支援他们，而且以最大的关怀注视着他们的胜利。因为朝鲜人民今日的战斗，正是他们明天行动的最好模范。
    克拉巴是一个二十四岁的青年，是阿尔及利亚民主青年联盟书记，又是阿尔及利亚共产党的领导人之一。阿尔及利亚民主青年联盟是共产党用国际主义精神教育青年的组织，会员们都是优秀的青年，他们在党的领导下，在斗争中起着重大的作用。谈到个人的斗争史，克拉巴说，并不是他自己怎么了不起，而是责任使他多做一点工作。今年二月二十一日有法国、越南、叙利亚三个青年代表世界青联到阿尔及利亚访问，这个日子是全世界青年支援殖民地青年的一个斗争日。克拉巴是世界青联理事之一，又是阿尔及利亚的青年工作者，他便陪着这三位青年走了五千公里路，参观了二十五个城市，遇到无数青年，提出一切问题，交换许多意见，最后，一致喊出了保卫世界和平的口号。他因此遭到帝国主义的忌恨，代表团刚一离开，他就被捕了，一关两个月，审问他的法官都是法国从越南特别调来的。直到七月五日他才在全世界的青年的支援下，迫使法帝不得不恢复他的自由。说到这里，他说：“也感谢中国青年，你们也有抗议信寄到了阿尔及利亚。”
    谈到对新中国的观感，他说，在东北，他看见工人们那样热烈地工作，学文化，看见农民有了土地、房子，孩子也入了学，人人一脸笑容。他说中国人民的胜利给殖民地国家无限的鼓励，中国人民的友谊使他们得到了四万万五千万人的支持，他们一定学习中国人民革命的经验，努力建立起一个像中华人民共和国一样的阿尔及利亚人民共和国。（附图片）
