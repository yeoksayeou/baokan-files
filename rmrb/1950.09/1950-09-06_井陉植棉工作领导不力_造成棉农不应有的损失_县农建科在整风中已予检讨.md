　　Ineffective Leadership in Jingxing Cotton Planting
  　Causes Undue Losses to Cotton Farmers
  　County Agricultural Construction Department Conducts Self-Criticism During Rectification Campaign
    [This newspaper Jingxing news] The Agricultural Construction Department of Jingxing County, Hebei Province, examined its bureaucratic work style in leading cotton planting during the rectification campaign. Jingxing County is located in a mountainous area, and farmers lack cotton planting habits and experience. This spring, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office assigned the county the task of planting 8,000 mu of cotton. At the time of sowing, due to the shortage of seeds, the county supply and marketing cooperative contacted Huolu County to purchase seeds. The first batch was transported, and after testing, the germination rate was 50% to 60%. The masses were then asked to double the sowing. Fortunately, there was a thorough rain during the sowing period, and a large-scale campaign to plant cotton was launched, which was not too bad. Later, due to insufficient seeds, a second batch of cotton seeds was transported from Huolu, and distributed to various districts without testing. As a result, the germination rate was only 10% to 20%, resulting in a waste of manpower and money, and the masses expressed dissatisfaction. Propaganda and education during sowing were also insufficient, causing some village cadres to believe that this was "planting cotton for the superiors" and allocating cotton planting tasks equally. For example, in Beigudi Village, Third District, each household planted an average of 1.5 fen of cotton, and in Xifangling Village, Fifth District, each household was allocated an average of 4.5 liang of cotton seeds. The masses lacked cotton planting technology, and the county leadership failed to provide timely guidance, such as holding cotton planting technology training classes; they only relied on cadres going to the countryside to publicize and help, but this force was very limited. Therefore, in some cotton fields, cotton and sesame were mixed, and some were even left as double plants; individual plants suffered undue losses due to early topping. In addition, some district cadres, without the consent of cotton farmers, took it upon themselves to thin out cotton seedlings, causing dissatisfaction among cotton farmers. Due to the poor quality of cotton seeds, of the 13,574 mu of cotton fields originally sown in the county, only 10,636 mu emerged. Coupled with poor cultivation and lack of technical guidance, according to inspections by various districts, the county's cotton fields may now be less than 8,000 mu. This is a series of evils caused by bureaucratic work style.
    The county Agricultural Construction Department pointed out in its self-criticism: Due to the influence of bureaucratic and commanding work styles, many cotton farmers have suffered undue losses. We have deeply examined the shortcomings and errors in leading cotton planting work during this rectification campaign, and we are determined to overcome them in the future.

　　井陉植棉工作领导不力
  　造成棉农不应有的损失
  　县农建科在整风中已予检讨
    【本报井陉讯】河北省井陉县农建科，在整风中检查了在领导植棉工作中的官僚主义作风。井陉县地处山区，农民没有种棉习惯和经验。今春石家庄专署分配给该县种棉八千亩的任务。播种时，因种籽缺乏，县供销社曾到获鹿县接洽购买，初次运来一部，经过试验，发芽率为百分之五十至六十，乃让群众加倍播种。播种期间，幸遇透雨，又号召大量突击种棉，收效也不太坏。后因种籽不足，二次从获鹿运来棉籽一部，未经试验，即分发各区，结果发芽率只达百分之十到二十，造成劳民伤财的不良后果，群众表示不满。在播种中宣传教育亦甚不够，致使一部分村干部认为这是“给上级种棉”，平均分配植棉任务。如三区北固底村每户平均种棉一分半，五区西方岭村，每户平均分配棉籽四两半。群众缺乏种棉技术，县领导上未及时予以指导，如召开种棉技术训练班等；只依靠下乡干部到村宣传和帮助，而这种力量又很有限，因此在部分棉田中，棉花、芝麻混杂，有的还留成双棵；个别的则因打尖太早，使棉株受到不应有的损失。另外，有的区干部，未经棉农同意，即自己动手，强将棉苗间稀，引起棉农不满。由于棉籽品质低劣，使全县原播种的一万三千五百七十四亩棉田，仅出苗一万零六百三十六亩，又加培育不好，缺乏技术指导，现经各区检查，全县棉田恐尚不足八千亩。这是一连串的官僚主义作风所造成的恶果。
    该县农建科在检讨中指出：由于官僚主义，命令主义作风的影响，使不少棉农受到不应有的损失。我们在此次整风中曾深刻检查了在领导种棉工作中的缺点和错误，今后一定要下决心争取克服。
