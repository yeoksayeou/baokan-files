From Seoul to Suwon (A Soldier's Diary)
    Korean Writer Jin Shiliang
    July 4th
    American bomber squadrons have been attacking for four or five consecutive days. In order to cover the puppet army on the opposite bank of the Han River and hinder our river-crossing operations, they attempted to destroy the Han River Railway Bridge. More than two regiments of enemy "suicide squads" also attempted to seize the bridgehead on the banks of the Noryangjin River, repeatedly launching blind charges.
    However, these enemies were beaten to a pulp by the valiant soldiers of the vanguard of our main force and completely annihilated. The American bomber squadrons were also repelled by the fierce shooting of our army's heroic anti-aircraft artillery units and were ultimately unable to achieve their goal of destroying the railway bridge.
    In such fierce battles, our main attacking force crossed the Han River day and night and continued its fierce offensive to the south.
    We reporters set off in three teams: some towards Incheon, some following the tank units, and some following the staff headquarters. I decided to cross the Han River tonight with the main attacking force advancing towards Suwon. In this unit, I happened to meet Comrade Gao Fenglong (transliteration), the cultural unit leader of a certain battalion in the unit.
    He is a capable military cadre who has been tempered. We talked happily and decided to take the train together. Old Gao was busy directing the loading of the artillery vehicles, running back and forth non-stop. I lay under the artillery vehicle carried on the freight car, listening to a soldier tell a combat story of a soldier in a certain unit. He said that a soldier got separated from his unit during the battle. He wanted to find his unit but mistakenly entered Gimpo Airport. After entering the airport, he found two planes starting their engines and preparing to take off. He destroyed the planes with automatic rifles and annihilated the fleeing enemy soldiers. While listening to the story, a freight car carrying fifty or sixty enemy soldiers captured at Gimpo Airport passed by. The train finally began to cross the river. Crossing the river was quite difficult.
    Transporting the artillery vehicles one by one across the railway bridge, which had been destroyed and rebuilt after the South Korean army fled, was a rather laborious task. The American planes, constantly hovering in the sky dropping flares, were driven away by the concentrated fire of our anti-aircraft machine guns and disappeared. The remnant bandits of the puppet army, completely turned into bandits, hid in groups of seven or eight, firing rocket launchers indiscriminately. Red lights streaked across the dark sky, and the sound of rifles harassed the air. Comrades from the Internal Affairs Department's security team were sweeping up the remnants of the enemy on the opposite bank of the Han River while guarding the night.
    July 5th
    The dawn moon is still bright. The puppet army has set up various defense facilities, concentrating the strength of two divisions, vainly attempting to retake Suwon City. Our People's Army soldiers, facing the enemy, are full of fighting spirit. It is impossible to know where the battle line extends to.
    We predicted that after losing Seoul, the enemy would use Suwon as the second line of defense and launch a major decisive battle. Therefore, our artillery vehicles must seize the time to rush to Suwon. Comrade Luo Zhuhong (transliteration), the battalion commander, and I sat on the driver's seat of the tractor pulling the 76mm artillery vehicle and set off from the riverbank in the moonlight.
    Pointing to the traces of the fierce battle beside the reservoir on the riverbank, Comrade Luo told me the story of Battalion Commander Shi Jinsong (transliteration) who fought heroically and then sacrificed himself heroically by blowing up his seriously injured body with a grenade.
    Captain Shi Jinsong was the hero who first conquered Dunam-dong Heights and Namsan Heights in the battle to liberate Seoul, thus ensuring the rapid advance of the entire unit. In the battle to cross the Han River, he again led only one battalion to fight bravely against two enemy regiments, occupying the Noryangjin Heights, gaining an outstanding reputation. Comrade Luo Zhuhong also participated in that battle when he inspected the enemy's firepower points. During the reservoir battle, Comrade Shi Jinsong was unfortunately wounded in the leg by an enemy mortar shell, and his whole body was covered in blood as he fell to the ground. "Old Luo, I'm done for, my leg is like this..." Comrade Luo Zhuhong and Comrade Shi Jinsong were good friends with deep friendship between these two battalion commanders. Comrade Luo quickly helped him up and said, "Look, the comrades of the battalion are conquering the heights, be strong!" "I entrust my affairs to you, I know I'm about to die." Comrade Shi Jinsong said this, taking out his Party membership card and soldier's certificate from his chest pocket with trembling hands and handing them to Comrade Luo. When Comrade Luo told me this story, his eyes were as red as torches.
    Captain Shi Jinsong finally said, "Quick! Go, leave me alone." Shi Jinsong did not disgrace the name of a soldier until the very end, bravely fighting and then committing suicide!
    At that time, Comrade Luo Zhuhong repelled the enemies who were crowded around by relying on their numbers with a pistol and managed to break through. Immediately afterward, he heard Comrade Shi Jinsong's heroic voices shouting "Long Live the People's Republic!" and "Long Live General Kim Il-sung!" followed by the loud explosion of a grenade.
    On the highway leading to Suwon, tanks, motorcycles, and trucks loaded with soldiers, which had crossed the Han River before us, were speeding towards the front line. Our 76mm artillery team was also speeding up to rush to the front line. All the bridges had been destroyed by the retreating South Korean army, and the march was quite arduous. After passing through the fierce battle site of Yeongdeungpo and arriving at Siheung, we saw that the fires that had been burning in the villages along the way since the day before yesterday were still burning. According to the villagers, this was caused by shrapnel from the mines exploded by the South Korean army when they blew up the bridges, which landed on the thatched houses and ignited them. About forty or fifty households were destroyed by the fire.
    A young woman carrying a child on her back and holding an iron rod was digging through the ashes. When she saw our team, she raised her hands and shouted "Long live!" Her hair was disheveled, and her eyes were filled with tears, as if she was telling us, "Avenge us quickly!" Seeing her expression, everyone felt very sad. The people who had fled and returned one after another, regardless of gender or age, gave way to us, walking along the small paths in the fields. The old people who had been deceived by the vicious propaganda of the puppet "National Defense Army" also escaped the clutches of the South Korean army and returned home.
    Next to a destroyed bridge, soldiers were enthusiastically repairing a tank. On the grass next to them, about a company of guerrillas were sitting around resting. Here, in order to change to a smaller vehicle, I talked with the guerrillas for a while. Most of them were rescued by the People's Army. This guerrilla team was composed of Jirisan guerrillas and underground workers.
    I jumped into a "Jeep" (American small car) going to the front line for liaison and hurriedly set off.
    On the way, we encountered a burst of rain and stopped the car by the roadside in Anyang. Together with the communications soldier, we ate a meal that was neither breakfast nor lunch. The villagers wholeheartedly welcomed us and recounted the past tragic situation with gnashing teeth. They recounted many facts about patriots being arrested by the police and innocent people being massacred. Their angry voices trembled like aspen leaves. They said, "How can we live under the same sky with these guys?" Just the day before yesterday, before the South Korean army retreated, they massacred sixty young people here. The more the reactionary party members and the American imperialists who are plotting behind the scenes breathe, the more the people will suffer! According to the residents, "Countless American soldiers and puppet 'National Defense Army' soldiers drove cars and ran hurriedly and chaotically on the highway."
    At this moment, the tank unit that liberated Incheon rumbled and vibrated the earth as it sped south. I jumped into a tank. The marines in the tank told me the tragedy of Incheon in a sorrowful voice: the South Korean military police pulled out two or three people at a time from the prisons, detention centers, and newly arrested people, chained them with iron locks, and then massacred them. In order to cover up the evidence, they tied iron blocks or stones to the corpses and threw them into the sea. The corpses have been washed away by the sea, and the families of the deceased are searching for the corpses everywhere, weeping bitterly. What brutal demons! Such inhumane facts cannot be found in the four thousand years of Korean history!
    Why do the American devils' planes fly across our country's sky full of bombs?
    Why do the devils strafe our innocent people and peaceful villages welcoming liberation with machine guns?
    We are not only fighting for the independence of our country and the freedom of our people, but also for the future of our descendants. We must dedicate our lives and fight to the end against the American aggressors and the South Korean army.
    At this moment, American planes flew in groups again, dropping bombs and strafing our tank units with machine guns. But our tanks advanced fearlessly and sternly. Forward! Forward! There is only this slogan on our front line.
    At this time, we encountered a team of prisoners being sent from the front. Among them were American wounded soldiers whose wounds had been bandaged by our People's Army medics. This group of prisoners was captured alive from the enemy artillery positions on the Suwon front. They were all looking down, chewing gum. Next to the bridge destroyed by the American bombers and the South Korean army's mines, I heard from the soldiers escorting the prisoners that Suwon had been completely liberated this morning. This news stunned me.
    Because the People's Army's progress was so rapid, we reporters couldn't even keep up, let alone write reports.
    The Suwon defense line that the enemy repeatedly boasted about was crushed like a matchbox under our army's overwhelming offensive.
    Like the citizens of Gaeseong who only woke up to find out that they had been liberated, the people of Suwon only heard more than an hour of gunfire at dawn and welcomed liberation. On the morning of the 5th, the sky was covered with a thin mist, and our tanks drove straight from the north gate to the south gate.
    Our pursuit was so swift and fierce. A South Korean military police officer who didn't have time to escape ran into our tank at the south gate. He couldn't even recognize whose tank it was! After the tank soldier discovered this black shadow on the road, he opened the hatch and asked, "Who?". The guy with the "Military Police" armband on his left arm replied loudly and arrogantly, "I am the military police!".
    The tank soldier smiled and shot him with his pistol. Only then did he realize that this was a People's Army tank. He ran towards the field, but fell down after only a few steps. This South Korean "military police" was the last enemy in Suwon City.
    July 6th
    After liberating Suwon at dawn yesterday, our unit immediately continued to pursue the defeated enemy. These enemies, already knowing their doom and end, not only made a last-ditch effort here, but also carried out a large-scale massacre of the people. The people of Suwon welcomed our People's Army like children who had survived the tiger's mouth hugging their father, and recounted their past tragic situation.
    It was raining last night. I listened under the eaves of a thatched house as a young man in the street recounted the situation in Suwon these past few days, which they had spent in terror and shivering.
    The blood-sucking Syngman Rhee South Korean army built strong fortifications on the old stone walls on the left and right sides of the Chang'an Gate, which guards Suwon City. On the one hand, they were equipped with many 45mm mortars, and on the other hand, they built a tight defense centered on Suwon Agricultural University, which is only 800 meters away from Chang'an Gate. At the same time, the hateful South Korean police invaded various districts and villages, looting on the one hand, and indiscriminately arresting progressive workers, farmers, students, and peaceful residents, and then dragging them to the wilderness and deep mountains to massacre them. There were 600 unidentified corpses of those massacred. These bloodsuckers even stabbed the elderly parents who were begging for the protection of their sons and daughters who were being dragged away with guns and knives, and threw the children into the paddy fields. No less than several hundred people were killed in this way.
    Not only that, the people imprisoned in the labor camp more than ten miles away were deceived and told that they would be transferred to Daejeon, but as a result, they were dragged to the mountains and massacred. Now, only the crows know their whereabouts. More than 360 patriotic men of Suwon City were taken out of the city and disappeared - these all happened around July 2nd and 3rd.
    On the first day of the People's Army's attack on Suwon, namely the 4th, the 18 patriotic youths detained in the Suwon Police Station were finally machine-gunned to death.
    At dawn, our troops began their march again in the pouring rain. The writer visited the police station at this time. It has now been replaced with a signboard of the Public Security Team. Comrades who were released from Mapo Prison and the youth of the city are carrying out public security work. According to the comrade in charge, after they arrived in Suwon with the People's Army on the morning of the 5th, they immediately began to clear out the police, military police, and treacherous elements. When they patrolled to the detention center, they heard a faint cry of "Long Live the People's Army" coming from inside. They jumped in and saw the corpses of the victims holding rice bowls piled up in the prison cell. In the middle of the corpses, a young boy shouted "Long live!" with a hoarse throat. Because he was at the very back, he was only shot in the buttocks and fortunately survived. The others were brutally massacred. I report this tragic situation to everyone, and I feel extremely grieved.
    After passing Suwon, the enemies we encountered were mainly American planes and marines. The South Korean "National Defense Army" had completely lost their fighting spirit and would only abandon their weapons and scatter into the mountains. The American devils, who came from nowhere and overestimated themselves, actually wanted to interfere in our country's own affairs.
    We separately looked for suitable pits and shade under trees to hide. A lovely boy about seventeen or eighteen years old in a black uniform, who looked very clever, walked forward limping. We took him to the foot of a hill and asked him, "Where are you going in such a hurry under the machine-gun fire of the plane?" The boy replied, "To Gongju." I forgot his surname, his name was Xiangxun (transliteration). He was originally a liaison officer of the Gongju County Party Committee and was imprisoned in Seodaemun Prison for a year and a half. After the liberation of Seoul, on his way back home, because he was still wearing the black uniform from the prison and was bald (prisoners in the South Korean government prisons had to shave their heads), he was arrested again by the police when he arrived in Suwon. This boy was the only survivor in the Suwon Police Station detention center.
    According to him, where they were detained, they were not given a drop of water, let alone food, for five or six days. The jackals of the police station suddenly gave each of them a rice bowl on the morning of the 4th, and the puppet police crowded together to peep into the prison cell. When the prisoners who were starving to death were all holding rice bowls, they suddenly took out machine guns and swept them, while also making hideous laughter. This boy was only slightly injured in the buttocks by chance, and he fell into a pool of blood pretending to be dead. In the evening, the roaring sound of artillery rang out, and he knew that the People's Army was approaching. He shouted with all his might with joy: "Long Live the People's Army!" At this time, he met his comrades and was rescued. The boy briefly described his experience, immediately stood up, limped forward, and said, "I have to hurry to Gongju...".

　　从汉城到水原（从军日记）
    朝鲜作家  金史良
    七月四日
    美国轰炸机群的侵袭接连四、五天了。他们为了掩护汉江对岸的傀儡军，妨害我们渡江作战，企图炸毁汉江铁桥。两个联队以上的敌军“敢死队”，也企图夺取鹭梁津江畔的桥头堡，重复进行着盲目的冲锋。
    但是这些敌人，被我主力军的先头部队英勇的将士们打得落花流水，全部就歼。美国轰炸机群也被我军英勇的高射炮部队的猛烈射击所击退，始终不能达到破坏铁桥的目的。
    在这样激烈的战斗中，我们进攻的主力部队日以继夜，渡过汉江，向南方继续着猛攻。
    我们报导工作者，分为三队出发：有的向仁川方面，有的跟着坦克部队，有的跟着参谋部。我是随着向水原前进的攻击主力，决定今天晚上渡汉江。我为了尽快到前线去，决定乘坐满载某军部队七六公毫米炮的列车，比某部参谋部先渡汉江。在这部队里我偶然碰见在该部队某大队担任文化部队队长的高峰龙（译音）同志。
    他是经过锻炼的一个能干的军事干部。我们彼此高兴地谈着话，决定一道坐列车。老高为指挥装炮车来回奔忙，跑个不停。我躺在货车上所载的炮车底下，听一个战士讲了某部队一个战士的战斗故事。他说，有一个战士战斗时掉了队，他想找队伍，但误入金浦飞机场，进入机场后他发现两架飞机正在发动发动机预备起飞，他以自动步枪破坏了飞机，并歼灭了逃跑的敌兵。正在听故事的时候，走过载着五六十个在金浦飞机场被俘的敌兵的货车。列车终于开始渡河。渡河是相当困难的。
    从国防军逃跑时破坏了又重修好的铁桥上把炮车一辆一辆运过去，是一项相当费劲的工作。不时在上空徘徊投照明弹的美机，遭到我高射机枪猛烈的集中射击，被赶得不见踪影了。完全变成土匪化的傀儡军残匪，七八个人一群隐藏着乱放火箭炮，红光划过漆黑的天空，步枪的声音也在空中骚扰着。内务部保安队的同志们在汉江对岸一面扫荡残兵，一面守夜警备着。
    七月五日
    晓月，依然明亮。傀儡军布置了各项防卫设备，集中了两个师团的兵力，妄想重占水原城，我们人民军的战士们，面对着敌军，斗志激昂。战线到底蔓延到那里都无法知道。
    我们预测到，敌人丢了汉城之后，以水原作为第二防线，将展开一大决战，因此我们的炮车必须争取时间赶到水原。我与大队长罗朱红（译音）同志一道坐在七六公毫米炮车牵引车的司机台上，在月色中从河畔出发了。
    罗同志指着河畔贮水池旁壮烈激战的遗迹，给我讲了大队长石金松（译音）英勇作战后，以手榴弹炸了自己受重伤的身体壮烈牺牲的故事。
    石金松队长是解放汉城战斗中最先攻克敦岩町高地与南山高地。因而保障全部队迅速进攻的英雄。在汉江渡河战斗中，他又带领着仅一个大队的兵力，与敌人的两个联队英勇奋战，占领了鹭梁津高地，英名卓著。罗朱红同志当时因视察敌人的火力点，也曾参加了那次战斗。石金松同志在贮水池战斗时，不幸腿部被敌人迫击炮弹炸伤，红血染满全身倒在地上。“老罗，我不行了，我的腿成了这样子……”，罗朱红同志和石金松同志这两位大队长之间是友谊深挚的好朋友。罗同志赶紧扶起他来说：“你看大队的同志们正在攻克高地，坚定些吧！”，“我把后事托付你，我知道我快要死了。”石金松同志这样说着，以颤抖的手从胸前衣袋内拿出党证和军人证交给罗同志。罗同志给我讲这故事的时候，两眼像火炬一般红。
    石金松队长最后还说：“快！你走罢，别管我。”石金松是一直到最后没有污辱军人的名字，勇敢的战斗后自尽了！
    当时，罗朱红同志以手枪击退恃众拥上来的敌人，好容易突围了。随后即听见石金松同志高呼人民共和国万岁和金日成将军万岁的壮烈声音，紧跟着是轰隆地爆炸了手榴弹的响声。
    在通往水原的公路上，比我们先渡汉江的坦克、摩托车和载满了战士的卡车，正向着前线飞驰。我们的七六公毫米炮兵队，也加紧着奔往前线的速度。所有的桥梁，都被傀儡军溃退时破坏了，行军是相当艰苦的。经过永登浦激战处到达始兴的时候，我们看到沿途各村庄从前天起就燃烧的火，还在燃烧着。据村民说：这是傀儡军们以地雷爆炸桥梁时候，弹片落在草房上引起来的火。被火烧毁的大约有四五十户。
    一个年青的女人背着孩子，拿着铁棍子在挖着灰堆，她看见我们的队伍，就举着两手高喊万岁。她，乱蓬蓬披着散发，两眼充满了泪水，好像告诉我们说：“快替我们报仇！”，看到她这一表情，我们每一个人都非常难过。逃难后又陆续归来的人民，不论男女老少，都给我们让着路，他们走着田畔的小径。曾为伪“国防军”恶毒宣传所欺骗的逃难的老百姓也逃出傀儡军的魔手，回家来了。
    在一座被破坏的桥梁旁，战士们正热心地修理着坦克车。在他们旁边草地上，大约有一个中队的游击队员们，围坐着休息。在这里，为了换小型车，我与游击队员谈了一会。他们大部分是人民军救出来，这一支游击队由智异山游击队员和地下工作人员组成的。
    我跳上了到第一线联络去的“越莱斯”（美国小型车），匆匆出发。
    在半路上，我们遇到一阵骤雨，在安阳路边停了车。和通讯员一起吃也不像早饭也不像午饭的一顿饭。村民衷心欢迎我们、切齿痛恨地诉说着过去悲惨处境。他们述说了许多爱国者被警察逮捕和无辜遭受屠杀的事实。他们愤怒的声音像杨树叶那样抖擞着。他们说：“怎么能和这些家伙们共戴天而生活呢？”就在前天，傀儡军溃退之前，他们屠杀了六十个此地的青年。反动党徒和在后面阴谋逞凶的美帝国主义者，多呼吸一天，人民就要多受一天罪！据居民说：“无数的美军与伪“国防军”开着汽车，匆忙地乱烘烘地拥挤在公路上跑了。”
    正在这时候，解放仁川的某坦克车部队车声辚辚震动着大地向着南方奔驰，我跳上了一辆坦克。坦克的陆战队员们，以沉痛的声音告诉我仁川的惨剧：傀儡军警们，从监狱、扣留所和刚逮捕的人中一次拉出两三个人，加以铁锁，然后屠杀。为了湮没罪证，又把尸体绑上铁块或石头投入海里。尸首已被海水冲走，死者的家属们到处找寻尸首，悲愤痛哭。多么凶暴的魔鬼啊！这样灭绝人性的事实，在四千年的朝鲜历史上，找不出第二个例子来！
    美国鬼子们的飞机，为什么满载炸弹，横飞我国的天空呢？
    鬼子们为什么对我们无辜的人民和迎接了解放的和平村庄，以机枪扫射呢？
    我们不仅为祖国的独立和人民的自由而战，而且为我们后代的将来必须献出生命，与美国侵略军和傀儡军斗争到最后。
    正在这时候，美国飞机又成群飞来，向我们坦克部队投掷炸弹，并以机枪扫射。但是我们的战车，毫不介意地凛然前进。向前！向前！在我们的前线只有这一口号。
    这时，我们遇到从前方送来的俘虏队伍。其中并有经我人民军军医裹了伤的美国伤兵。这批俘虏是在水原前线敌人炮兵阵地上活捉的敌人。他们一个个低着头，嚼着口香糖。在被美国轰炸机和傀儡军的地雷破坏的桥梁旁边，我从押解俘虏的战士口中听到了水原已在今晨完全解放的消息，这消息使我愣住了。
    由于人民军的进展这样神速，我们报道工作者不用说写报道，连跟着跑都来不及。
    敌人一再吹嘘的水原防线，在我军势如破竹的猛攻之下，像火柴盒一样被粉碎了。
    和一觉醒来才知道已经解放的开城市民一样；水原的人民拂晓时只听见了一个多钟头的枪炮声，就迎接了解放。五日的清晨，天空笼罩着细雾，我们的坦克从北门直开到南门。
    我们的追击是如此的迅速和猛烈。来不及逃跑的一个伪宪兵，在南门碰上了我们的坦克，他还认不清是谁的坦克呢！坦克兵在路上发现这个黑影子后，就打开了车盖，盘问了一句“谁？”，左臂上带着“宪兵”臂章的这个家伙，还神气十足地高声回答道：“我是宪兵！”。
    坦克兵笑着拿出手枪射击了他，他到这时候才知道了这是人民军的坦克车，向田畔跑了没有几步，就倒下去了。这个伪“宪兵”就是水原城中的最后一个敌人。
    七月六日
    昨天破晓解放了水原之后，我们某部队立刻继续追击溃败的敌人。这些仇敌们，已预知自己的灭亡和末路，在这里不仅作了最后挣扎，而且还大规模地屠杀人民。水原的人民好像是虎口余生的孩子抱住自己的父亲一样，欢迎着我们人民军队，并诉说着过去悲惨的处境。
    昨晚下着雨，我在茅屋的房檐下，听着街上的青年讲述在恐怖和战栗中熬过的这几天水原的情形。
    像吸血鬼一样的李承晚傀儡军，在水原城护城长安门的左右的旧石城，构筑了顽强的工事。一方面配备许多四十五公毫米迫击炮，一方面以距长安门前才八百公尺的水原农业大学为中心，布置了严密的阵地。同时可恶的伪军警们：侵入各区和村庄，一面进行洗劫；一面滥捕进步的工人、农民、学生与和平居民，然后再拉到荒野和深山里屠杀。被屠杀的无法辨认的尸首有六百具。这些吸血鬼们对护卫着自己被拉走的儿女而哀求的老年父母竟用枪刀刺倒，又把小孩们摔到水田里去。这样被杀的人也不下数百。
    不仅如此，囚在离此十余里的犯人劳动所的人们，被骗说把他们移到大田去，结果是拉到山上屠杀了。现在除了乌鸦群之外，再也没有人知道他们的消息了。水原城内的三百六十多名爱国志士被拉出城外后，一去无踪——这些都是七月二、三日前后发生的事情。
    人民军进攻水原的头一天，即四日，关在水原警察所的十八名爱国青年，最后也被用机枪扫射杀死。
    黎明时候，我们的部队冒着狂雨，又开始进军了。笔者在这个时间访问了警察所。那里现在已换上了治安队的牌子。由麻浦监狱出狱的同志们与城内青年担任着治安工作。据负责同志说：五日早晨，他们随着人民军到水原后，立刻进行肃清警察、宪兵和奸恶分子的工作。当他们巡视到扣押所时，听到了里面传出来“人民军队万岁”的微弱呼音，他们跳进去一看，监房里堆着手里拿着饭碗的死难者的尸体，在尸体中间一个少年哑着喉咙喊“万岁！”因为他在最后面，仅臀部受了枪伤，侥幸的得了活命，其余都被残忍地屠杀了。我向大家报告这凄惨的情形，心中感到万分悲痛。
    过了水原之后，我们所遇见的敌人，主要是美国飞机和陆战队。伪“国防军”完全丧失了斗志，只会抛弃武器溃散到山里去，不知那儿来的不自量力的美国鬼子，竟要来干涉我们国家内自己的事务。
    我们分别找寻适当的坑和树荫底下去隐蔽，有一个穿黑制服约十七、八岁，看样子很伶俐的可爱少年，跛着腿走向前来。我们把他带到一个山丘下，问他：“在飞机机枪扫射下，你忙着到那儿去？”少年回答说：“到公州去”。我忘记了他的姓，他的名字叫相勋（译音）他原来是公州郡党部的联络员，在西大门监狱被监禁一年半。汉城解放之后，在回乡途上，因为他仍穿着一身监狱里的黑制服，又是光头（伪政府监狱里的犯人都须剃成光头）到了水原时就又被警察逮捕。这个少年就是水原警察局扣押所内那个唯一的生还者。
    据他说，在他们被扣压的地方，五天六天之内，不用说吃饭，连一口水都没有给过他们。那些警察所的豺狼们，突然在四日早晨发给他们每人一个饭碗，伪警们则挤在一起向囚室里窥探。当饥饿得要死的囚犯们都拿着饭碗的时候，他们突然拿出机枪扫射，一面又发出狰狞的狂笑。这少年侥幸仅臀部受轻伤，他倒在血泊中假装死去。到晚间，轰轰的炮声响了，他知道人民军队进攻迫近了。他高兴得用全力高喊：“人民军万岁！”这时他遇到了自己的同志，才被救了出来。少年简单地叙述了自己的遭遇，立刻站起来，跛着向前走去，并且说：“我要赶着到公州去……。”          （原载平壤“劳动新闻”）
