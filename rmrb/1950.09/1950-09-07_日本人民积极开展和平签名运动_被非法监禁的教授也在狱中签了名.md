　　Japanese People Actively Carry Out Peace Signature Campaign
    Illegally Imprisoned Professor Also Signs in Jail
    [Xinhua News Agency, 6th] The Japanese people are actively launching a peace signature campaign to oppose wars of aggression. According to a combined report from the United Press Association: As of August 14th, according to reports received by the "Peace Defense Society" alone, the number of Japanese people who have signed the peace declaration has reached 2,128,000. The 180,000 signatures of the Japanese Repatriates League and the 70,000 signatures from Nagasaki Prefecture are not yet included in the statistics.
    In Miyagi Prefecture, on the day of the fifth anniversary of Japan's surrender on "August 15th," Akiyama Megumi, winner of the Mainichi Art Award, and Hayashi Nobuo, an interpreter of broadcast music, both signed the Stockholm Declaration. On the same day, Kamiya Rokuro, the former professor of Tohoku University and Sendai City Councilor, who was illegally sentenced to hard labor for "violating occupation policy," also heroically signed the declaration in Miyagi Prison.
    The goal of the Miyagi Prefecture "Peace Defense Society" is to collect one million signatures. Some active peace advocates have collected signatures from one or two hundred people individually. As of August 9th, four town councilors and many respected figures in Shimokawa Town, Shida County, Miyagi Prefecture, had collected nearly 2,000 signatures. Children in Miyagi Prefecture have also shown their pure desire for peace. On August 13th, about 100 of them gathered to hold a peace conference in Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture. The conference resolved, "We do not want war."

    【新华社六日讯】日本人民积极展开和平签名运动，反对侵略战争。综合联合通讯社消息：截至八月十四日止，仅“保卫和平之会”所收到的报告，日本人民在和平宣言上签名的，已达二百十二万八千人。日本归还者同盟的十八万个签名及长崎县的七万个签名，尚未统计在内。
    在宫城县，在“八·一五”日本投降五周年纪念那一天，每日文艺赏得奖者秋山惠及广播音乐解释者林信夫都在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。同日，因“违反占领政策”而被非法判处苦役的前东北大学教授、仙台市议员神谷六郎，也英勇地在宫城监狱中签了名。
    宫城县“保卫和平之会”的目标是征集一百万个签名。而有些积极的和平拥护者，一个人就征集了一、二百人的签名。该县志田郡下川町的町议员四人及有声望的人士多人，截至八月九日止，已征集了近二千个签名。宫城县的儿童也表现出他们热爱和平的纯朴志愿。他们于八月十三日集合了约一百人，在该县仙台市举行和平大会。大会决议“我们不要战争”。
