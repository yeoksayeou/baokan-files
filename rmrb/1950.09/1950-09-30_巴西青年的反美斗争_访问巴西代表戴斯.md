　　Brazilian Youth's Anti-American Struggle
　　-- Interview with Brazilian Representative Diaz
　　"Our government is a very reactionary government, colluding with American imperialism and placing the entire Brazil under the rule of Wall Street." Diaz, the representative from Brazil in the Americas, resentfully spoke these words at the beginning of the interview with the reporter.
　　Brazil has many uranium mines, and the government has sold them all to American imperialism for operation. The Brazilian people see that the owners of their mines are not themselves, but American soldiers in military uniforms. American advisors are in every department of the government. The weapons used by the Brazilian army are made in the United States, and even the clothing and insignia are exactly the same as the US military. In the army, there are open advisory groups composed of American officers. The army is trained militarily by the United States, instilled with fascism, and taught to oppose the people, the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving countries. Under the manipulation of the United States, military spending accounts for 52 percent of Brazil's national budget. Education and public health together account for only 8.5 percent. In Wall Street's secret plans, American imperialism wants Brazil to send two million troops in the next war.
　　"The current combat goal of the Brazilian people is to oppose aggressive war and defend world peace. Like Chinese youth before liberation, the youth bravely participate in every struggle under the political pressure of the reactionary government and become the backbone of the struggle."
　　Diaz told a story that happened in the previous three months:
　　When American imperialism launched a bloody war of aggression against Korea, the reactionary Brazilian government announced that it would send 20,000 soldiers to Korea to die for American imperialism. On July 22, mass rallies of all sizes were held across the country to protest the government's criminal actions. At the three largest mass rallies in the Brazilian capital, San Paulo, and Recife, angry youth and masses clashed with armed police, resulting in 200 deaths and injuries. Under the opposition of the people, the Brazilian government had to stop sending troops.
　　Currently, in every mine, factory, school, and street in Brazil, young people are actively participating in the signature campaign. A female student collected 3,200 signatures in one district and one factory; all the workers in that factory participated in the signature campaign. As of August 25, 1.1 million signatures had been collected nationwide, of which 250,000 were from youth and those they collected. Brazilian youth plan to collect another 500,000 signatures before the end of October. Diaz said with confidence: "We will definitely be able to complete this task."
　　The topic turned to the lives of Brazilian youth and people. Diaz said, "Seventy-four percent of the people in Brazil are illiterate. Diseases often harm the health of the people; a worker's monthly salary of twelve US dollars is not enough to make a living."
　　Diaz finally told the reporter: "The experience of the Chinese people's struggle against the American Chiang Kai-shek clique is very helpful to us. If we can implement the experience of the Chinese revolution into our practical actions, we will certainly be able to achieve the final victory like China."

### 巴西青年的反美斗争——访问巴西代表戴斯

　　巴西青年的反美斗争
    ——访问巴西代表戴斯
    “我国的政府是一个很反动的政府，它和美帝勾结，把整个的巴西都置于华尔街的统治下。”来自美洲的巴西代表戴斯，在记者访问的一开始就愤恨地讲了这段话。
    在巴西，铀矿是很多的，政府把他全部卖给了美帝经营，巴西人民看到：他们矿山的主人不是他们自己，而是穿着军服的美国军人。在政府的各个部门中都有着美国的顾问。巴西军队使用的武器是美国制造的，连服装、符号也完全是美军的式样。在军队中，有公开的由美国军官组成的顾问团。军队由美国进行军事训练，灌输法西斯主义，教导兵士们反对人民、反对苏联及一切爱好和平的国家。在美国的操纵下，巴西国家财政预算中军事费占了百分之五十二。而教育及公共卫生费一共才占百分之八点五。在华尔街的秘密计划中，美帝要巴西在下次的大战中出兵二百万。
    “巴西人民当前的战斗目标是反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平。青年们如同中国青年在解放前一样，在反动政府的政治高压下，依然勇敢地参加每一次斗争，并且成为斗争中的骨干。”
    戴斯讲了一件在前三个月发生的事情：
    当美帝对朝鲜发动了血腥的侵略战争后，巴西反动政府宣布了要派二万名兵士去替美帝到朝鲜送死。七月二十二日的那一天，全国各地普遍举行了大大小小的群众大会，抗议政府的这个罪恶行动。在巴西首都、山保、海西佛的三个最大的群众大会上，愤激的青年和群众们和武装干涉的警察冲突起来了，死伤达二百人，巴西政府在人民的反对下，不得不停止派兵。
    目前，在巴西每个矿山、工厂、学校和街道上，都有青年们积极地参加签名运动。有一位女学生曾在一个区和一个工厂中征集了三千二百人的签名，那个工厂中全体工人参加签名。到八月二十五日为止全国已有一百一十万签名，其中有二十五万是青年和他们所征集的。巴西青年计划在十月底以前再征集五十万人的签名。戴斯充满信心地说：“我们是一定能完成这个任务。”
    话题转到了巴西青年和人民的生活。戴斯说：“巴西的人民百分之七十四是文盲。疾病经常地损害着人民的健康；工人每月十二元美金的工资不够足以维持生活。”
    戴斯最后告诉记者说：“中国人民反对美蒋的斗争经验对我们是很有帮助的，如果我们能把中国革命的经验贯彻到我们实际行动中去，我们也一定可以象中国一样，能够取得最后的胜利。”
