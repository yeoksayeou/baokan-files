　　Polish News Agency, Warsaw: The People's Tribune, the organ of the Polish United Workers' Party, published an editorial on the 19th regarding the opening of the Fifth UN General Assembly, stating: America's strategy has consistently been to turn the United Nations organization into a tool of imperialist aggression against those countries that have liberated themselves from the shackles of capitalism. Countries warmly welcomed the news of the establishment of the United Nations organization five years ago, but this is absolutely not what the countries hoped for, nor is it what the people who need peace hope for. The people demand that the majority of countries in the United Nations organization stop obstructing and undermining the UN Charter. The people demand that all qualified countries be able to send representatives to participate in the United Nations, and in particular, the seat of the Kuomintang puppet bought with American money should be taken by the legitimate representatives of more than 475 million Chinese people. The people demand that the United Nations stop American intervention in Korea and demand that it accept the Soviet Union's proposal for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. The people demand that the United Nations organization take a firm stand against the atomic madmen and demand that it ban all weapons of mass destruction. The people demand that the United Nations organization stop the imperialists from aggressing against those people who seek their own liberation, and stop the slaughter of women, children, and elderly people in Korea, Malaya, Vietnam, and the Philippines. The people demand that the United Nations fulfill the tasks it should fulfill.

　　波报评五届联合国大会
    联合国应执行人民要求
    邀请我国出席并制止美帝侵略
    【新华社二十一日讯】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰统一工人党机关报人民论坛报，十九日就联合国五届大会开幕发表社论称：美国的策略一贯在使联合国组织变为帝国主义侵略的工具，来反对那些已自资本主义束缚下获得解放的国家。各国在五年以前曾热烈欢迎联合国组织成立的消息，但各国所希望的却决不是如此，这也不是需要和平的人民所希望的。人民要求联合国组织的多数国家停止阻挠和破坏联合国宪章。人民要求一切合格的国家均能派遣代表参加联合国，尤其是美国人所花钱收买的国民党傀儡席位应该由四亿七千五百万以上的中国人民的合法代表取得。人民要求联合国制止美国在朝鲜干涉，并要求它接受苏联关于和平解决冲突的建议。人民要求联合国组织对原子疯人们采取坚决的立场，并要求它禁止一切大规模杀人的武器。人民要求联合国组织制止帝国主义者对那些谋求自身解放的人民进行侵略，并制止屠杀朝鲜、马来亚、越南及菲律宾的妇女、儿童与老人，人民要求联合国执行它应该执行的任务。
