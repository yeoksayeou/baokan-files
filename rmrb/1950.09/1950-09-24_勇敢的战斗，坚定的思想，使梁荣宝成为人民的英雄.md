　　Brave Fighting, Firm Ideology, Making Liang Rongbao a People's Hero
　　Zhu Bo
　　In April 1947, when the Northeast People's Liberation Army launched its summer offensive against the Kuomintang bandit troops on the entire front, Comrade Liang Rongbao, like other liberated peasants, voluntarily left his beloved family and land to go to the battlefield. Under the Party's training, he quickly mastered military skills in the war and became a people's hero.
　　In 1948, the Kuomintang bandit troops in the Northeast were divided and surrounded by the People's Liberation Army in a narrow corridor between Changchun and Shenyang. Comrade Liang Rongbao's unit received the task of surrounding the bandit troops in Changchun. The day after the change of guard, the enemy attacked Comrade Liang Rongbao's company with two regiments, attempting to break through our army's position. At that time, the frontline troops of our army believed that the bandit troops did not dare to come out of their shells because Changchun had been besieged for more than half a year, and even the company's commanders and fighters were carelessly sleeping. Only a few sentries on the first line of defense were patrolling back and forth, monitoring the enemy.
　　It was a dawn in autumn, and everything on the ground was covered by fog. Although the alert sentries of our army had their eyes wide open, they could not see anything beyond a step. The autumn wind rustled the surrounding grass and trees. At this moment, the enemy quietly approached our sentries, stabbed them to death, and then captured one of our bunkers. They quickly inserted two companies of troops into the position of one company of our unit. Our soldiers were awakened by the intense gunfire. The company commander quickly led Liang Rongbao's machine gun squad and a combat team from the seventh squad to rush towards the enemy. At that time, Liang Rongbao was a machine gunner. He calmly used his machine gun to cooperate with the comrades in the combat team, rushing into the enemy's position. In order to cooperate well with the combat team, Comrade Liang Rongbao shouted, "Comrades, it's time for us to make meritorious contributions. My machine gun will guarantee your success!" Comrade Liang Rongbao rushed to a place more than ten meters away from the enemy. Without even having time to lie down, he stood holding the machine gun and fired at the enemy, finally suppressing the enemy's firepower and killing the enemy's commander who was holding the command flag. More than a dozen enemies were also killed, causing more than a hundred enemies to be thrown into chaos and flee in all directions. Then, taking advantage of the enemy's wavering and confusion, he shouted, "The People's Liberation Army treats prisoners of war well. Surrender and you will not be killed!" winning over more than a dozen enemies to surrender. This enemy force was thus defeated by his machine gun. The machine gun fired more than 800 bullets, and the heated barrel burned blisters on Comrade Liang Rongbao's hands. His leg was also pierced by an enemy bullet.
　　After crushing this enemy force, Comrade Liang Rongbao dragged his wounded leg and followed the company commander to attack the enemy surrounding the second platoon, persisting until the enemy was driven back, before he left the front line. After this battle, he became a glorious Communist Party member. In this battle, Comrade Liang Rongbao demonstrated the power of the machine gun, reversing the critical situation of our army's defense line. He was awarded a great merit for this.
　　In 1949, Comrade Liang Rongbao served as a squad leader and a member of the CCP branch in a certain unit of the Central Column of the Public Security Forces. At that time, the idea of peace and enjoyment was growing in the troops. Many comrades believed that victory had been achieved and wanted to go home to solve their personal marriage problems. This idea became a fairly common tendency in the troops, and it was a major problem that needed to be urgently solved in the political work of consolidating the troops at that time. Liang Rongbao was also considering how to correct this ideological tendency in his squad, platoon, and even company. But just at this time, a letter came from Liang Rongbao's family, asking him to go back to get married quickly. Comrade Rongbao struggled with this letter in his mind. He thought of his fiancée, Wu Guizhen, and everything he saw about Guizhen the last time he went home... But he also clearly thought that the deputy squad leader of his squad also had a fiancée, and other squads and units had similar situations. If he asked for leave at this time, it would inevitably affect other comrades; many people would ask for leave, which would affect the troops' completion of their glorious defense tasks. This issue was a serious test for him, like a battle. But Liang Rongbao, with his high level of awareness, happily told the instructor that he did not want to go home. He said that he did not plan to write home, and his family would not know his mailing address. The instructor told him that this was not a good solution, and that he should write a letter to persuade his family, so that the problem would be solved more completely. Comrade Rongbao did so. In this way, this matter and Liang Rongbao's name spread throughout the troops. Many comrades, influenced by Comrade Liang Rongbao's exemplary actions, expressed their determination to learn from Comrade Liang Rongbao. Comrade Liang Rongbao's action played a significant role in stabilizing the ideological sentiment of the troops at that time and consolidating the troops politically. Therefore, at the end-of-year summary of the troops, Liang Rongbao was again selected as a special-class model of the division.

　　勇敢的战斗，坚定的思想，使梁荣宝成为人民的英雄
    朱波
    一九四七年四月，东北人民解放军在整个战线上向国民党匪军展开夏季进攻的时候，梁荣宝同志也像其他翻身农民一样，自动的离开自己可爱的家人、土地，走上战场。在党的培养下，在战争中很快的掌握军事技术，成为人民的英雄。
    一九四八年，东北地区国民党匪军，被人民解放军分割包围在长春、沈阳一条狭小的走廊里。梁荣宝同志所在部队接受包围长春匪军的任务。换防的第二天，敌人以两个团的兵力向梁荣宝所在连队突击，企图突破我军阵地。当时我军前线部队因为长春已被围困半年多了，认为匪军不敢走出乌龟壳，连的指战员都粗心大意的睡觉了。只有第一道防线很少的几个哨兵，来回的巡逻着监视着敌人。
    这是一个秋天的拂晓，地面上的一切东西，均被雾遮住了。机警的我军哨兵，虽然张开着大眼睛，也没有办法瞧见一步以外的景物。秋风吹着四周围的草木沙沙作响，就在这时候，敌人悄悄的摸近我们的哨兵，将哨兵刺死后，随即攻陷了我们的一个碉堡，迅速将两个连的兵力，插进我某部一连的阵地。我们的战士们被激烈的枪炮声惊醒了。一连连长很快的带着梁荣宝机枪小组和七班的一个战斗组，扑向敌人。当时的梁荣宝是机枪射手，他很沉着的用机枪配合着战斗组的同志，冲进敌人的阵地，为了和战斗组配合的好，梁荣宝同志高喊：“同志们，到了我们立功的时候了，我的机枪保证你们冲上去！”梁荣宝同志一直冲到离敌人十余米的地方，来不及卧倒，就站着拿着机枪筒向敌人扫射，终于把敌人的火力压下去，并将敌人手执指挥旗的指挥官打死，十几个敌人也被打死了。使一百多敌人混乱了阵营四散奔逃。这时他又趁着敌人的动摇混乱，高喊：“解放军优待俘虏，缴枪不杀！”争取十几个敌人投降。这一股敌人就这样被他的机枪打垮了。机枪一连打出八百多发子弹，打热了的枪筒把梁荣宝同志的手都烫起了水泡。他的腿也被敌人的子弹打穿了。
    冲垮了这股敌人以后，梁荣宝同志拖着负伤的腿，又随着连长冲向包围二排的敌人，直坚持到将敌人打退，他才离开前线。就在这次战斗结束后，他成了光荣的共产党员。在这次战斗中，梁荣宝同志发挥了机枪的威力，挽回了我军防线的危急情况，这次他立了一大功。
    一九四九年，梁荣宝同志在公安部队中央纵队某部任班长及中共支部委员。当时部队里正滋长着和平享乐思想，很多同志认为胜利了，想回家解决个个人的婚姻问题。这种思想成为部队里相当普遍的倾向，在当时巩固部队政治工作中的急需解决的主要问题，梁荣宝也在考虑如何纠正本班、本排以至本连的这种思想倾向。可是正在这个时候，梁荣宝家里来了信，要他赶快回去结婚。荣宝同志拿着这封信思想上展开了斗争，他想到自己的未婚妻吴桂珍，想到他最后一次回家时，见到桂珍的一切情景……。但是他更清楚的想到自己班的班副也有未婚妻，其他各班、各单位都有这样情况，如果在这个时候提出来请假，必然影响其他同志；许多人都要请假，就会影响部队完成光荣的保卫任务。这个问题像战斗一样严重的考验着他。但是有着高度觉悟的梁荣宝，很愉快的告诉指导员，他不想回家了，他说他打算不写信回家，家里不知道通信地址也就完了。指导员告诉他这个办法不好，应该写信说服家里，这样问题解决的更完满。荣宝同志就这样做了。就这样这件事情和梁荣宝的名字一起传遍了部队。很多同志在梁荣宝同志的模范行动影响下，表示决心要向梁荣宝同志学习。梁荣宝同志这一行动，对稳定当时部队思想情绪，从政治上巩固部队来说，是有重大作用的。因此在部队年终总结时，梁荣宝又被选为师的特等模范。
