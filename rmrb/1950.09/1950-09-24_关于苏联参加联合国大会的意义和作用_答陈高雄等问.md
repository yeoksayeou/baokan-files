To the Editor:

We are all employees of a private store. We discussed the significance and role of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries' participation in the United Nations General Assembly for an entire evening, but we still couldn't reach a conclusion, so we have to ask you to answer it.

We know that the United Nations organization was originally an important tool for maintaining world peace and international security, but it has been severely damaged by American imperialism. Everyone knows that whether in the United Nations General Assembly or in the Security Council, the US imperialists control a "majority" voting machine composed of their lackeys. As long as the US imperialists press the button, they can pass any proposal that is beneficial to the aggressive bloc and veto any proposal that promotes peace and democracy. No matter how loudly the representatives of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries shout, representing the people of the world, the aggressive bloc ignores them. Some time ago, we read in the newspaper about Malik's moving speech in the Security Council pleading for the Greek patriotic fighters who had been sentenced to death, and we all cried. However, the inhuman "majority" voting machine vetoed the Soviet proposal again. What is the significance and role of the Soviet representative participating in such a Security Council, especially in the United Nations General Assembly where the five powers do not have the right of veto? Please provide an answer.

Same as above

Comrades Chen Gaoxiong, Shi Weisheng, and Lu Xiangsheng:

The United Nations has indeed been severely damaged by American imperialism and its lackeys. In particular, the US imperialists' use of the United Nations' name to carry out its armed aggression against Korea has stained the solemn United Nations flag with the blood of the Korean patriotic people. The US imperialists also used their "majority" voting machine to prevent the delegation of the People's Republic of China, representing 475 million people, from participating in the United Nations General Assembly, and even allowed the representative of the Chinese people's public enemy, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, to make shameless cries in the United Nations meeting hall, playing its "farce of a dance of the dead" (in the words of the Polish representative attending this session of the United Nations). Under the rape of American imperialism, the United Nations organization is indeed facing an unprecedented crisis.

However, the solemn United Nations Charter has always been sincerely supported by the people of the world. The aggressive camp headed by the US imperialists is trying to completely destroy this charter, trying to undermine the principle of unanimity among the five powers, and abolish the Soviet Union's veto power in the Security Council, so that the "majority" voting machine can operate more freely, while the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is waging unremitting struggles to safeguard the dignity of the United Nations Charter. This is a struggle related to the fate of the people of the whole world, and all peace-loving and democratic countries and people must unite closely to participate in this struggle, strike the war mongers from all sides, and strive for the complete victory of peace and democracy. From this perspective, the participation of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries' representatives in the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council is of great significance.

The Soviet Union's repeated proposals to the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly, and the Soviet representatives' repeated speeches on the United Nations platform, although vetoed by the "majority" voting machine controlled by the US imperialists, have played an inestimable role in the ranks of the people of the world. Through these proposals and speeches, the Soviet Union has repeatedly explained its peace policy, exposed the US imperialists' criminal conspiracy to instigate war, condemned the US imperialists' aggressive atrocities, pointed out the specific path to defend peace, encouraged the people of the world to oppose aggression and defend peace, and greatly restricted the aggressive activities of the war mongers. If it were not for the Soviet representatives' hard work in the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council, the United Nations organization would have become a thorough tool of aggression long ago. That is why the war mongers are so afraid of the Soviet representatives' speeches in the United Nations meeting hall.

At this session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet representative again put forward a specific plan for establishing a lasting peace. This plan once again reflects the undeniable Soviet peace policy and the urgent demands of the people of the world. If that "majority" voting machine vetoes this plan again, then the whole world can see the war mongers dancing naked.

### 关于苏联参加联合国大会的意义和作用——答陈高雄等问

　　关于苏联参加联合国大会的意义和作用
    ——答陈高雄等问编辑同志：
    我们都是一家私营商店的店员。我们对于苏联和各新民主主义国家参加联合国大会的意义和作用问题，讨论了一个晚上，依然得不出结论，不得不要求你们加以解答。
    我们知道联合国机构原是维持世界和平和国际安全的重要工具，但它已被美帝国主义破坏得很厉害了。谁都知道：不论在联合国大会或在安全理事会，美帝都操纵着一架由它的仆从们所组成的“多数”表决机，只要美帝一按机钮，便可以通过任何有利于侵略集团的提案，否决任何促进和平民主的提案。不管苏联和各新民主主义国家的代表们如何大声疾呼，代表全世界人民发言，侵略集团一概置之不理。前些时在报上读了马立克在安理会为希腊大批被判处死刑的爱国志士们请命的动人的演说，我们都哭了。然而毫无人性的“多数”表决机又否决了苏联的建议。苏联代表参加这样的安理会，尤其是参加五强没有否决权的联合国大会，到底有什么意义和作用呢？请予解答。
            陈高雄  施维生  陆祥生  同上陈高雄、施维生、陆祥生诸同志：
    联合国确乎被美帝国主义及其仆从们糟蹋得很厉害了。尤其是美帝国主义盗用了联合国名义来进行其对朝鲜的武装侵略，使庄严的联合国旗帜染上了朝鲜爱国人民的鲜血。美帝又利用其“多数”表决机阻止了代表四万万七千五百万人民的中华人民共和国的代表团参加联合国大会，竟让中国人民的公敌蒋匪帮的代表在联合国会场上作无耻的叫嚣，扮演其“死人舞蹈的滑稽剧”（出席本届联大的波兰代表语）。在美帝国主义的强奸下，联合国机构的确碰到了空前的危机。
    然而庄严的联合国宪章始终为全世界人民所竭诚拥护。以美帝为首的侵略阵营力图彻底摧毁这个宪章，力图破坏五强一致的原则，取消苏联在安理会的否决权，使“多数”表决机活动得更自由些，而以苏联为首的和平民主阵营则为维护联合国宪章的尊严而进行不倦的斗争。这是有关全世界人民命运的斗争，一切爱好和平民主的国家和人民都必须紧紧团结起来参加这一斗争，从各方面打击战争贩子们，争取和平民主的彻底胜利。从这个角度看，苏联和各新民主主义国家的代表们参加联合国大会和安理会，就有绝大的意义。
    苏联向安理会和联合国大会的屡次建议，苏联代表在联合国讲坛上的屡次发言，虽然被美帝操纵的“多数”表决机所否决，但在全世界人民队伍中发挥了不可估计的作用。通过这些建议和发言，苏联反复说明了自己的和平政策，揭穿了美帝挑拨战争的罪恶阴谋，谴责了美帝的侵略暴行，指出了保卫和平的具体道路，鼓舞了全世界反对侵略、保卫和平的人民，大大限制了战争贩子们的侵略活动。如果没有苏联代表在联合国大会和安理会的努力奋斗，则联合国机构早已成为彻头彻尾的侵略工具了。战争贩子们所以那样害怕苏联代表在联合国会场上的发言，原因便在这里。
    在本届联合国大会上，苏联代表又提出了建立持久和平的具体方案。这个方案又一次反映了无可争辩的苏联和平政策和全世界人民的迫切要求。如果那架“多数”表决机又否决了这个方案，那末全世界的眼睛都可以看见战争贩子们在裸体跳舞了。
