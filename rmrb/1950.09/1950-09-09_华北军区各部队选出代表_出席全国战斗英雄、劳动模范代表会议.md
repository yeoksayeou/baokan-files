　　Representatives from Various Units of the North China Military Region Selected to Attend the National Congress of Combat Heroes and Model Workers

　　[Report from this newspaper] Representatives from units under the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to attend the National Congress of Combat Heroes and the National Congress of Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Models were selected by the end of August and are currently under review by the military region. After the Political Department of the military region issued instructions in early August regarding the implementation of the Military Commission and the Government Administration Council's decision to convene the National Congress of Combat Heroes and the National Congress of Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Models, all units, based on the spirit of the instructions and in light of their specific circumstances, convened Party committee meetings to specifically study concrete implementation methods. They issued supplementary instructions or notices, established hero and model selection committees at all levels, and designated responsible cadres to supervise the progress of this work. Under the leadership of Party committees and selection committees at all levels, all units conducted education among all personnel in the troops and held democratic selections at each level from bottom to top. Finally, at the congresses of hero and model representatives held in the provincial military districts or armies, representatives to the National Congress of Heroes and Models were solemnly elected from each provincial military district or army. This method of selection, combining leadership and the masses, ensures that the selected hero and model representatives are truly closely connected with the masses, have prestige among the masses, and are qualified to represent the masses. During the period of holding congresses of hero and model representatives at all levels, all units widely disseminated the deeds of hero and model representatives and educated all personnel in the troops through propaganda methods such as conference journals, conference reports, or dramas, paintings, seminars, and speeches. At the same time, all units organized activities such as seeing off, welcoming, and presenting flowers to hero and model representatives at all levels, which inspired the new heroism of the troops. Currently, provincial military districts and armies have selected forty combat hero representatives (including fifteen militia heroes) and twenty-two labor model representatives. The number of combat hero representatives selected above meets the quota for the North China Military Region to attend the National Congress of Combat Heroes as stipulated by the General Political Department of the Military Commission, and can be officially designated as representatives to the National Congress of Combat Heroes after review and approval by the North China Military Region. The quota for the North China Military Region to attend the National Congress of Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Models, according to the regulations of the General Political Department, is six. The North China Military Region is now working to review and select six representatives from the twenty-two labor model representatives selected from the entire military region to serve as representatives to the National Congress of Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Models.
