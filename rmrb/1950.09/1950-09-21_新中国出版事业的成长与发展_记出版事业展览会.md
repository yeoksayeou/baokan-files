The Publishing Industry Exhibition, sponsored by the Preparatory Committee of the First National Publishing Conference, held its opening ceremony at Beihai Park at 10:00 AM on the 17th, presided over by Director Hu Yuzhi. All representatives of the First National Publishing Conference and heads of various agencies attended. The four exhibition halls were then officially opened. Except for the fourth hall, which exhibits Soviet publications, the first, second, and third halls are introduced as follows:

The entrance to the first hall is a large book several feet high and wide. Visitors enter through the middle of the book. The hall systematically displays books and periodicals published in various historical stages from the Opium War to the founding of the People's Republic of China. From these publications, it can be seen that the people's publishing work played a significant role in the awakening, unity, progress, and unification of the vast Chinese people, becoming an indispensable part of the Chinese revolutionary cause.

From the Opium War until the basic victory of the People's Liberation War, it went through several great historical stages: the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Reform Movement of 1898, the Revolution of 1911, the May Fourth Movement, the First Revolutionary Civil War, the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the Third Revolutionary Civil War, and the birth of the People's Republic of China. In these stages, the people's publishing industry became a powerful weapon for publicizing revolutionary ideas and developing revolutionary organizations. Especially after the May Fourth Movement, with the advent of the New Democratic era, the new publishing industry shouldered the task of propaganda, mobilization, and organization of the broad masses of the people. Marxist ideology began to spread in China, opening a new and rich page in the political and cultural life of the Chinese people, and giving new life to China's publishing work.

The main books and periodicals of each stage are displayed here. In the 1860s and 1870s, the Chinese people, subjected to imperialist aggression, rose up to explore and find a way out, and many translated books on natural sciences, technical sciences, and the introduction of bourgeois cultural ideas began to appear, including natural science and applied science books translated by the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau, and books representing Western capitalist culture translated by Yan Fu, Lin Qin'nan, and others. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was the first great revolution of the Chinese people in modern times. The peasants established their own regime and also published their own books. Books such as "Exhortations to Awaken the World" were weapons used at that time to mobilize the peasant revolution and fight against the rulers. After the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, upper-class intellectuals successively issued calls for national salvation, advocating reform and publishing newspapers and many pamphlets. On display here are the "Shiwu Bao" (The Chinese Progress), organized by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao a year before the Reform Movement of 1898, as well as the "Xinmin Congbao" (New Citizen Journal) after the failure of the reform and the collections of essays by Tan Sitong, Liu Guangdi, and others from the "Six Gentlemen". During the Revolution of 1911, "Min Bao," the organ of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), is also on display here, as well as many books and periodicals on the revolutionary movement by Sun Yat-sen and Zhang Taiyan. The May Fourth Movement was the watershed between the old and new democratic revolutions. The publication of "New Youth" magazine played a significant role in the spread of Marxism-Leninism, and progressive literary works also assumed the task of enlightening young people's minds and inspiring young people's struggles. After 1921, the Literary Research Society and the Creation Society were the two pillars responsible for this task, and most of the works of this period are displayed here. During the First Revolutionary Civil War, "China Youth" and "Guide Weekly" were the ideological leaders of the revolutionary masses.

After 1927, the Chinese people established revolutionary base areas in the countryside. By the time of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, these base areas had expanded further. Although the Kuomintang reactionaries' blockade of the liberated areas caused great material difficulties, the people's publishing industry did not stop because of this. Translations of Marxist-Leninist classics and works that used Marxism to study Chinese problems were still published in large numbers. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people's publishing industry carried out various forms of cruel struggle against the reactionaries. Here we see the Kuomintang reactionary government's documents of massacring the people's publishing industry and banning a large number of books and periodicals; but on the other hand, we can also see that revolutionary publications were constantly spread through the blockade of reactionary inspectors and police in secret distribution or even in disguise. We can see books with the content of Chairman Mao's "On Protracted War", "On New Stage" and "On New Democracy", but printed with the four characters "Wen Shi Tong Yi" (General Meaning of Literature and History). This is how revolutionary publications carried out a resolute struggle against the reactionaries. This power is something that the enemies of the revolution cannot eliminate.

After the founding of the Central People's Government, from January to June 1950, a total of more than 95 million copies of books were published nationwide, including books and periodicals in various fraternal ethnic languages.

The exhibits in the second hall show the progress of China's printing technology and the process of book and periodical publishing. It is systematically divided into four parts: the letterpress printing section introduces the printing of everything from poetry paper to New Year pictures and various woodcut works, as well as a series of printing processes such as typecasting, engraving, typesetting, stereotyping, platemaking, and phototypesetting; the planographic printing section introduces stone printing, phototypesetting, ink printing, map platemaking and printing processes; the intaglio printing section introduces the printing of stamps, pictorials, and propaganda posters; the binding section introduces various bookbinding methods from different eras. On display here are the oldest binding method, "Quan Tang Wen" (Complete Tang Prose), and the latest binding method, "People's Political Consultative Conference Commemorative Album".

The third hall is an exhibition room of China's national cultural heritage of the past three thousand years. Among them are oracle bones from the Yin Dynasty dating back to 2000 BC (unearthed in Anyang County, Pingyuan Province); wooden slips from the Han Dynasty, rubbings from stone scriptures of the Han and Wei Dynasties, handwritten scrolls from the Six Dynasties and the Tang Dynasty, and engraved books from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties. The items in this exhibition room are connected to the exhibits in the first hall. After viewing the two halls, the entire development process of our national culture can be deeply engraved in our minds.

　　新中国出版事业的成长与发展
    记出版事业展览会
    第一届全国出版会议筹委会主办的出版事业展览会于十七日晨十时在北海公园举行揭幕式，由胡愈之署长主持。到有第一届全国出版会议全体代表及各机关首长。四个展览馆随即正式开放。除第四馆是展览苏联出版物外，兹将第一、二、三馆介绍如下：
    第一馆的大门是一本高阔各数丈的大书，参观的人，由书的中间进入，馆内有系统地陈列了从鸦片战争起直到中华人民共和国成立为止的各个历史阶段所出版的书刊。从这些出版物中，可以看到人民出版工作对广大中国人民的觉醒、团结、进步和统一，曾经起了巨大的作用，成为中国革命事业不可缺少的一部分。
    从鸦片战争起，直到人民解放战争获得基本胜利为止。其间经历了太平天国、戊戌维新运动、辛亥革命、“五四”运动、第一次国内革命战争、第二次国内革命战争、抗日民族战争、第三次国内革命战争、中华人民共和国诞生等几个伟大的历史阶段。人民的出版事业在这些阶段中，都成为宣扬革命主张，发展革命组织的有力武器，特别是“五四”运动以后，随着新民主主义时期的到来，新的出版事业担负了宣传鼓动和组织广大人民的任务。马克思主义思想开始在中国流传，使中国人民政治生活与文化生活展开了新的丰富的一页，也使中国出版工作获得了新的生命。
    每一阶段的主要书刊在这里均有陈列。在十九世纪六十、七十年代，受到帝国主义侵略的中国人民起来摸索着寻找出路，开始出现了许多有关“声、光、化、电”的自然科学、技术科学和介绍资产阶级的文化思想的译书，其中有江南制造局翻译的自然科学、应用科学书籍和严复、林琴南等翻译的代表西方资本主义文化的书籍。太平天国是近代中国人民第一次大革命，农民建立了自己的政权，也出版了自己的书籍，《醒世文》等书就是当时用以鼓动农民革命，和统治者作斗争的武器。一八九四年中日战争失败以后，上层知识分子纷纷发出救亡图存的呼声，主张变法维新，出版了报纸和许多小册子，这里陈列的有戊戌维新运动前一年康有为、梁启超所主办的《时务报》，以及变法失败后的《新民丛报》和《六君子》中的谭嗣同、刘光第等人的文集。辛亥革命时，作为同盟会机关刊物的《民报》在这里也有陈列，还有许多孙中山、章太炎的革命运动书刊。“五四”运动是旧民主主义和新民主主义革命的分水岭，《新青年》杂志的出版在马列主义思想的传播上曾起了很大的作用，进步的文学作品也负起了启发青年思想，鼓舞青年斗争的任务。一九二一年以后，文学研究会和创造社就是负起这个责任的两条支柱，这里陈列了这一时期的大部分著作。在第一次国内革命战争时期，《中国青年》和《向导周报》曾是革命群众在思想上的领导者。
    一九二七年以后，中国人民在农村中建立了革命根据地，到抗日战争时，这个根据地更形扩大了，虽然，由于反动派对解放区的封锁造成了很大的物质困难，但人民的出版事业并没有因此而停顿，马列主义经典著作的译本和用马克思主义研究中国问题的著作仍大量出版。在国民党反动派统治下，人民出版事业和反动派进行着各种方式的残酷斗争，这里我们看到国民党反动政府虐杀人民出版事业，大量查禁书刊的公文；但另一方面，我们也可以看到革命的出版物曾不断的用秘密发行甚至用伪装的方式通过反动派检查官与宪警的封锁而传播开去。我们可以看到以毛主席《论持久战》《论新阶段》《新民主主义论》为内容的书面，却印上了“文史通义”四个字，革命的出版物就是这样与反动派作坚决的斗争，这个力量，是革命的敌人消灭不了的。
    中央人民政府成立以后，在一九五○年一—六月份，全国出版书籍共有九千五百余万册，其中包括各兄弟民族语文的书刊。
    第二馆的陈列品表现出我国印刷技术的进展，书刊出版的过程。这里有系统地分成了四个部分：凸版印刷部分，介绍了从诗笺谱到新年画的印刷和各种木刻作品，以及浇字、刻字、排字、纸型、浇版、照相制版等一系列的印刷过程；平版印刷部分，介绍了石印、照相制版、油墨印刷、地图等制版和印刷过程；凹版印刷部分，介绍了邮票、画报和宣传画的印制；装订部分，介绍了不同时代的各种书籍装订方法。这里陈列的有最古装订法的《全唐文》和最新装订法的《人民政协纪念册》。
    第三馆是我国三千年来民族文化遗产的展览室。其中有远古纪元前二千年的殷代甲骨（平原省安阳县出土的）；汉代的木简、汉魏石经拓片、六朝、唐代的写卷，以及宋、元、明、清各代的雕版书籍。这个展览室的东西，正和第一馆的展览品相衔接。看完两馆以后，在我们的头脑里可以深深铭刻着我国民族文化的整个发展过程。
