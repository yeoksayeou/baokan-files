　　To Attend the National Conference of Labor Model Representatives
	Representatives of Model Workers in Beijing and Tianjin Elected
	[This newspaper dispatch] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The four worker representatives from Beijing who will attend the National Conference of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers were elected on the 7th and 8th of this month from the 35 representatives who were re-elected. The elected representatives are Hou Deyuan, a young outstanding engineer from the Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau; Liu Dezhen, the advanced production team leader from the Shijingshan Power Plant; Li Shuhe, a coal mining expert from the Chengzi Coal Mine; and Li Jinquan, a special-grade technician and unyielding advanced producer from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant.
	To carefully select these four representatives, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions formed a review committee composed of 33 people, including members of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, heads of various departments and commissions, and invited heads of major industrial and mining enterprises. The election assembly was held in the Labor People's Cultural Palace. The venue was full of vivid written explanations, charts, photos, and slogans of the model deeds of each candidate. How much wealth someone created for the people, who improved production tools, who made machines safe, and so on, could be clearly seen at a glance. The election was conducted by means of a second ballot, which was very prudent and fully promoted democracy. The 35 representatives all cast their votes for the most popular representatives with the class-based fraternal feelings of heroes cherishing heroes. Everyone believed that the model deeds of the four elected representatives were good examples for the capital's workers to learn from. After discussion, the review committee unanimously agreed that these four elected labor models should represent the Beijing worker labor models at the National Conference of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.
	After the election results were announced, Hou Deyuan spoke, saying: It is a great honor to be elected as a representative, but this honor should belong to the entire working class. In the future, we must ensure that engineers and workers, technical guidance and actual production are closely combined to create more wealth for the country.
	[Another Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Government invited representatives of model workers in Beijing to a forum at the Laijin Yuxuan in Zhongshan Park at 5 p.m. on the 8th, and hosted a banquet. Liu Ren, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Minister of the Organization Department, and Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Municipal Government, personally attended and presided over the meeting. In addition to the four representatives attending the National Conference of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, including Hou Deyuan, Liu Dezhen, Li Shuhe, and Li Jinquan, and 31 labor model representatives who were re-elected at the Beijing Labor Model Election Conference, there were also more than 40 people from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, party, government, and labor leaders of major factories and mines, and relevant government departments. At the forum, the labor model representatives, with a spirit of actively taking responsibility for national production, provided many constructive opinions on the main existing problems in the production policies, administrative management, and safety and health equipment of various factories and mines.
