Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 6th: The "Pravda" correspondent Kornilov reports from Pyongyang: Many South Korean people's delegations are visiting cities and villages in North Korea. A new world unfolds before the Southern guests arriving in Pyongyang and surrounding areas. They linger with amazement in front of state-owned store doors, watching exhibits of domestically made farming machines, motors, and mining machinery. They inquire attentively of the sons and daughters of workers and peasants, now wearing student uniforms. For many years, these visitors have suffered the pain of poverty and tyrannical rule south of the 38th parallel. Today, they personally witness the achievements their compatriots have made in just five short years. This fills them with pride for their homeland and confidence in a bright future.

	The female teacher Li Hongdeng (transliteration) told reporters: I never imagined that North Korea had so many schools. I have spoken with students. They all study for free, and the state helps them in every way. But in South Korea under the rule of Syngman Rhee, schools have become profit-making enterprises.

	Li Yingding (transliteration), a worker at a textile factory in Seoul, spoke enthusiastically about the living conditions of North Korean workers: Here, the eight-hour workday has been implemented, child labor is prohibited, and equal pay for equal work is the rule. If illness occurs, workers can receive subsidies from the social insurance fund, and medical care is free. Today, the Korean working class is prepared to defend all that has been gained in the fierce struggle against the enemy.

	Professor Meng Songmin (transliteration) said: When we return to our hometowns, we will report the full truth about free Korea to the people. We will appeal to all workers, peasants, office workers, and scientists to rise up more resolutely and fight for the freedom and independence of the motherland.

　　朝鲜南部人民代表团访问北部城市乡村
    盛赞北部建设及人民幸福生活
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：《真理报》记者科尔尼洛夫自平壤报道：许多南朝鲜人民代表团正在北朝鲜各城市与乡村中访问。在到达平壤与附近地区的南方客人面前，展开了一个新的世界。他们以惊奇的眼光逗留在国营商店的门前，观看展览着的本国制的耕种机、马达与开矿机器等。他们关切地向现在穿着学生制服的工农子女提出问题。多年以来，这些来访的人在三八线以南经历着贫穷和暴虐的统治的痛苦。今天，他们亲眼目睹了他们的同胞们在短短的五年中所创造的成绩。这使他们满心感到祖国的骄傲，对光辉灿烂的未来具备了信心。
    女教师李红登（译音）对记者说：我从来没有想到北朝鲜有这么多学校。我曾经与学生们谈过话。他们读书都是免费的，国家从各方面来帮助他们。但是在李承晚统治下的南朝鲜，学校却成了谋利的企业。
    汉城纺织厂工人李英定（译音）热烈地谈着北朝鲜工人的生活情况：在这里，已经实行了每日八小时工作制，禁止童工和同工同酬的办法。如果发生疾病，工人们可以从社会保险基金中获得补助费，医药是免费的。今天，朝鲜工人阶级准备保卫在与敌人进行坚强的斗争中所获得的一切。
    教授梦松民（译音）说：当我们回到家乡时，我们将向人民报告自由朝鲜的全部真实情况。我们将向所有工人、农民、职员与科学家呼吁，要更坚决地起来为祖国的自由、独立而斗争。
