Chahar Province Industrial Labor Model Representatives
Met Chairman Mao and Vowed
To Improve Production Upon Return
Editor's Note: All industrial labor model representatives from Chahar Province met Chairman Mao on the 25th. They excitedly wrote down their feelings and sent them to this newspaper, stating:

	The wish we have cherished for many years was fulfilled at around 4 p.m. on September 25th. Less than an hour after our meeting began, we suddenly heard the children from the nursery outside the door jumping, laughing, and clapping their hands. We realized at that moment: Chairman Mao must be here! Sure enough, in less than a minute, our great leader Chairman Mao walked steadily into the venue with a smile on his face. Everyone in the venue stood up unconsciously, and the thunderous applause continued for more than ten minutes. We welcomed him with such excitement! The music played by the band was so pleasant and beautiful. This great scene made our hearts yearn for it. When Vice Premier Huang Yanpei spoke, the applause stopped, but our minds had not yet turned around. Everyone was thinking of shaking hands with our most beloved Chairman Mao, but the meeting was in progress, so we had to calm ourselves and pick up our pens to record.

	After Vice Premier Huang finished speaking, Chairman Mao stood up and walked to the front of the stage. Everyone in the audience was once again so jubilant and inspired. Chairman Mao, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a congratulatory speech to the representatives present. He called on us to continue learning in battle without arrogance or fatigue, to learn from the broad masses of the people, and to always maintain our glorious title. He also called on us to unite with all the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, workers, farmers, and other people, and work together to strive for the establishment of a strong national defense force and a strong economic force for our China. Today, Chairman Mao has given us the greatest glory.

	We will always remember Chairman Mao's words from now on, and we will make our industrial production better and better upon our return!

　　察省工业劳模代表
    见了毛主席立下誓愿
    回去把生产搞得更好
    编者按：察省全体工业劳模代表于二十五日见到了毛主席，他们兴奋地写出自己的感想寄来本报，文称：
    我们多年来时刻不忘的心愿，在九月二十五日下午四点多钟时实现了。我们的会议开幕不到一小时，忽然听到门外保育院的小朋友们，又跳又笑又拍手，我们当时就意识到：是毛主席来了吧？果然，不到一分钟，我们伟大的领袖毛主席满面笑容地稳步走进会场。会场上所有的人，都不知不觉地站起来了，如雷的掌声十几分钟还不停息，是那样兴高采烈地欢迎啊！乐队奏的乐又是那样悦耳地好听。这伟大的场面使我们的心神都为之向往。黄炎培副总理讲话了，掌声才停下来，我们的脑子还没有转过来，大家都想着去和最敬爱的毛主席握握手，但会议正在进行，只好镇定心神，拿起笔来纪录。
    黄副总理讲完了话，毛主席站了起来，步入台前，全场所有的人又是那样的欢欣鼓舞。毛主席代表中共中央向与会的代表们致祝词。他号召我们要不骄傲不疲倦地继续在战斗中学习，向广大人民群众学习，永远保持着光荣的称号。他又号召我们和所有的解放军指战员、工人、农民及其他人民一道，团结一致，协同努力，为建立我们中国的强大的国防军及强大的经济力量而奋斗。今天，毛主席给了我们最大的光荣。
    我们今后将永远地记着毛主席的话，回去要把咱们的工业生产搞得更好更好！
