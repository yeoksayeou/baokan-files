Strengthen the Peace Movement and Stop Wars of Aggression!
	Chen Shutong
	Since the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress passed a resolution on March 19th this year in Stockholm, Sweden, calling on people of all races and nationalities, regardless of political views and religious beliefs, regardless of social status, to unanimously support world peace, ban atomic weapons, establish strict international control to supervise its implementation, and consider the government that first uses atomic weapons to invade and collectively massacre people as war criminals, the scale and organization of the world peace movement has been expanding day by day. It has received widespread response among people of all strata in various countries and has truly become a great mass movement of people in all countries around the world. The broad masses of people of all strata have felt that world peace is under serious threat and are realizing that the struggle against war instigators and the struggle to defend peace has become the cause of the people of all countries around the world.
	The China Peace Protection Committee has issued a notice calling on the people of the whole country to continue to strive to get 200 million people to sign the Stockholm Declaration. This is a great and glorious task, and every peace-loving person will enthusiastically sign it. This signature campaign has now spread from major cities to medium and small cities throughout the country, and has penetrated into rural areas. According to incomplete statistics, more than 20 provinces and hundreds of counties in major administrative regions across the country have launched peace signature campaigns, and through this movement, the political awareness of the broad masses of the people has been deepened, arousing their concern for the international peace movement.
	The Soviet Union is also launching a great signature campaign throughout the country. The Soviet Peace Protection Committee stated that it is convinced that every Soviet citizen will sign the Stockholm Declaration demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons. According to a recent report on the peace signature campaign in 75 countries around the world announced by Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, 115,270,000 people in the Soviet Union have signed. At the first session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held in Moscow in June, the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress was also discussed. The representatives of the Supreme Soviet unanimously passed a statement on behalf of all the Soviet people, expressing their full support for the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, and believed that the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress is: "fully in line with the most urgent needs of the people of all countries and their desire to obtain stable and lasting peace throughout the world."
	"The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union believes that the Soviet government, which has always advocated peace and cooperation among the people of all countries, will resolutely and unswervingly continue to implement this policy of maintaining peaceful and friendly relations among the people of all countries; will resolutely and unswervingly continue to take the necessary steps through the organization of the United Nations and use all other methods to seek world peace and international security."
	Due to the enthusiastic support of the two major allied countries, China and the Soviet Union, and the people of all countries around the world for world peace, the strength of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union is stronger than at any time in the past. Until recently, the signatures of peace-loving people around the world have reached 336 million. The performance of this great and organized people's power has caused great panic among the imperialist warmongers, forcing them, even though they are carrying out shameful wars of aggression, to clamor for "peace." However, the "peace" of the imperialist warmongers is to conquer others with armed forces. In order to get rid of their increasingly pressing economic crisis, they have now moved from instigating war preparations to taking direct armed aggression against freedom- and peace-loving people and further expanding the scope of the war.
	In the past two months, the US imperialists have repeatedly increased their naval, land, and air forces to interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean people, and have used the flag of the United Nations as a cover to carry out piratical aggression against the Korean people, and to carry out despicable aggression against Taiwan, Vietnam and other Asian regions. This all points out that the imperialist aggressors have risked the world's condemnation and are determined to destroy peace and attempt to conquer the world's people in order to save themselves from destruction! At the same time, it points out that although the forces of world peace are strong, they are not strong enough to force the imperialist aggressors not to act. They are currently desperately struggling because they see the growing development and strength of the forces of peace, and that they will eventually be drowned by the peace wave launched by the people of the world! Therefore, they are struggling even more desperately. The US imperialists, who have been severely hit by the Korean people in the war of aggression against Korea and have aroused the anger of the people of the world, have become angry and revealed their hideous faces. In order to cover up their shameful defeat, they have carried out barbarous and inhumane bombing of peaceful cities, towns and villages in Korea, massacring thousands upon thousands of innocent men, women and children. On the one hand, they are unreasonable and have turned the United Nations Security Council into an aggressive tool for international imperialist war instigators, and use the United Nations platform to carry out their propaganda to deceive the people of the world, shamelessly slandering the Korean people as aggressors and opposing Soviet representative Malik's proposal for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.
	The resolution passed by the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress held in Prague recently stated: "The international situation has recently become increasingly worse, and a direct threat to world peace has arisen, which makes all peace supporters have new obligations that are more important than ever before."
	This also means that the struggle for peace is entering a decisive stage of great battle. The time for people of all strata in all countries around the world to thoroughly mobilize their strength and use active actions to defend peace has become even more urgent. We must realize that the US imperialist aggression against Korea and other regions of Asia clearly tells the people of all countries around the world that the crisis threatening world peace continues to grow. Only by uniting all the forces of peace-loving people in all countries, only by further expanding and strengthening the peace movement, can we avoid a new war crisis.
	The US imperialists are making full use of the Korean incident to strengthen their domestic war power and further control Western European Marshallized countries to step up armed preparations and intimidate other small countries in the world, so that under their own banner of aggression, they can expand the scope of the war for the benefit of the US monopoly capitalists. We must expose the lies of all imperialist warmongers that war is inevitable and the slander against the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy, and oppose underestimating the danger of war, because underestimating the danger of war will inevitably paralyze peace supporters and only help the aggressors. We must especially recognize the seriousness of the current US imperialist aggression in Korea, unite the peace-loving people of all countries around the world, and enthusiastically support the Soviet representative Malik's proposal in the Security Council to restore the legitimate nature of the Security Council and restore peace in Korea through peaceful means.
	In addition to using the name of the Security Council to desperately gather cannon fodder to step up aggression and massacre of the peaceful people of Korea, the international imperialist war instigators are also using all means to prevent the growth of the peace movement. They deceive, intimidate, and strike peace supporters with the most despicable and brutal acts, arresting or assassinating peace activists, and organizing various provocative acts in an attempt to frustrate the active activities of peace supporters.
	Only with an indomitable will, regardless of all difficulties and the threats and suppression of imperialism, can the people of all countries around the world closely unite under the banner of peace, expand and strengthen the peace movement, raise the enthusiasm of the masses, and bravely work together to defend peace. And prove to the people of the world that the strength of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union today far exceeds the strength of the imperialist aggression camp, that the people themselves do not want war, and that they have the ability to stop war, and that warmongers are just a small group of pathetic adventurers! In the great struggle to defend peace, the people of all countries around the world will surely be able to stop the implementation of the vicious conspiracy of the imperialists to plan aggression against the people of Asian countries and undermine world peace, and establish a lasting peace of mutual friendship among the people of all countries around the world.

　　加强和平运动，制止侵略战争！
    陈叔通
    自从世界拥护和平大会常设委员会于今年三月十九日在瑞典京城斯德哥尔摩通过决议，号召全世界人民不分种族和国籍，不分政治见解和宗教信仰，不分社会地位，一致在拥护世界和平禁用原子武器，建立严格的国际管制以监督其执行，把首先使用原子武器来侵略和集体屠杀人民的政府认为战争罪犯的宣言上签名后，世界拥护和平运动的规模和组织已日益扩大，在世界各国各阶层人民中间，已得到广泛的响应，真正成为全世界各国人民的一个伟大的群众性的运动，各阶层的广大人民都已感觉世界和平已受严重的威胁，正在认识到反对战争挑拨者的斗争，和拥护和平的斗争，已成为全世界各国人民自己的事业。
    中国保卫和平大会委员会已经发出通告，号召全国人民继续努力争取二万万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，这是一个伟大光荣的任务，我们每个爱好和平的人民都将会踊跃签名；这一签名运动目下已由全国各大城市到中小城市，而且深入了农村。据不完全的统计，全国各大行政区已有二十多个省份，好几百个县已展开了和平签名运动，并且通过这一运动已加深了广大人民群众的政治觉悟，唤起他们对国际保卫和平运动的关心。
    苏联在全国各地也正展开了伟大的签名运动，苏联拥护和平委员会表示，确信每个苏联公民必将在要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名。据世界拥护和平大会常设委员会主席约里奥·居里最近公布的全世界七十五个国家的和平签名运动的报告，苏联已有一亿一千五百二十七万人签名。六月间在莫斯科举行的苏联最高苏维埃第一届会议上并且讨论了世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的宣言，最高苏维埃代表全体苏联人民一致通过声明，表示完全拥护世界和平大会常设委员会的宣言，并认为世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的宣言是：“完全符合一切国家的人民最迫切的需要以及他们想得到全世界的稳定的持久和平的愿望。”
    “苏联最高苏维埃相信一贯主张各国人民间的和平与合作的苏联政府一定会坚决地，不屈不挠地继续执行这种保持各国人民间和平友好的关系的政策；一定会坚决地，不屈不挠地继续通过联合国的组织采取必要的步骤并利用一切其他的方法以求得世界和平与国际安全。”
    由于中苏两大同盟国和全世界各国人民对世界和平的热烈拥护，以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的力量比之过去任何时期都更见强大，直到最近为止，全世界拥护和平人民的签名已达三亿三千六百万人，这一有组织的伟大的人民力量的表现，已使得帝国主义战争贩子们大起恐慌，迫使他们虽然正在进行着可耻的侵略战争，却也不得不叫嚣“和平”。可是帝国主义战争贩子们的“和平”是要用武装力量征服别人的。他们为要摆脱其本身日益迫切的经济危机，目前已由挑拨战争准备战争进入到实行对爱好自由与和平的人民采取直接武装侵略行动及进一步扩大战争范围的阶段。
    两个月来，美帝国主义者一再增派其海陆空军实行干涉朝鲜人民的内政，复利用联合国的旗帜做掩护，对朝鲜人民进行海盗式的侵略，并对台湾，越南及其他亚洲地区进行卑鄙的侵略，这都指明了帝国主义侵略者已甘冒天下之大不韪，决心破坏和平妄图征服世界人民以挽救自己的灭亡！同时也指明了世界和平力量虽然强大，但还不曾强大到能迫使帝国主义侵略者不敢弹动，他们目前正因为眼看到和平力量的日益发展和壮大，最后自己必定要被全世界人民所掀起的和平浪涛所淹没！因此就更加拚命挣扎，在对朝鲜的侵略战争中遭到朝鲜人民的痛击及引起了全世界人民的愤怒的美帝国主义者老羞成怒，露出狰狞的脸目，为掩饰其可耻的惨败，便对朝鲜和平的城市乡镇农村，进行野蛮的惨无人道的大轰炸，屠杀成千成万无辜的男女老幼。一面又蛮不讲理，把联合国安全理事会变成国际帝国主义战争挑拨者的侵略机构，并利用联合国的讲坛以进行其欺骗世界人民的宣传，无耻地诬蔑朝鲜人民为侵略者，反对苏联代表马立克和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。
    最近在布拉格举行的世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局会议通过的决议说：“国际形势最近已愈趋恶化，已经产生了对世界和平的直接威胁，这就使得全体和平拥护者有了较之前此任何时候都更为重大的新义务。”
    这也就意味着拥护和平的斗争，正进入了大战斗的决定性阶段。要求全世界各国各阶层人民彻底动员自己的力量，用积极的行动来保卫和平的时候已经更为迫切了，我们必须认识到美帝国主义侵略朝鲜及亚洲其他地区的行为，分明告诉了全世界各国人民威胁世界和平的危机仍继续增长，只有团结一切爱好和平的各国人民的全部力量，只有更加扩大和加强和平运动，才能避免新的战争的危机。
    美帝国主义正在充分利用朝鲜事件以加强其国内的战争力量及进一步控制西欧马歇尔化国家以加紧武装准备并恫吓世界上其他各个小国家，使在自己的侵略旗帜之下，为美帝国主义独占资本家的利益扩大战争的范围。我们必须揭穿帝国主义的一切战争贩子关于战争是不可避免的谎言和对于苏联一贯的和平政策的诬蔑，并反对过低估计战争的危险性，因为低估了战争的危险，势必麻痹和平拥护者，而只有助于侵略者。我们尤必须认清目前美帝国主义者在朝鲜的侵略行动的严重性，团结全世界各国爱好和平的人民，热烈支持安全理事会苏联代表马立克关于恢复安理会的合法性质及恢复朝鲜和平的和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。
    国际帝国主义战争挑拨者们目前除一面利用安理会名义拚命凑集炮灰以加紧侵略和屠杀朝鲜和平人民外，同时正在用尽方法以阻止和平运动的增长，他们一面欺骗，一面恫吓，并以最卑鄙的残暴行为打击和平拥护者，把和平运动者加以逮捕或暗杀，并组织各种各样的挑衅行为，以图挫败和平拥护者的积极活动。
    全世界各国人民只有以不屈不挠的意志，不顾一切困难及帝国主义的威胁与镇压，紧密团结在和平的旗帜之下，扩大和加强和平运动，提高群众的积极性，勇敢地为拥护和平而一致努力。并向全世界人民证明，今天以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的力量，已经远超过了帝国主义侵略阵营的力量，人民自己不要战争，并且有能力来制止战争，战争贩子不过是一小撮可怜的冒险家！全世界各国人民在加强团结，以联合的力量来进行保卫和平的伟大斗争中必能制止帝国主义者所策划的侵略亚洲各国人民破坏世界和平的恶毒阴谋的实现，建立全世界的各国人民相互友好的持久和平。
