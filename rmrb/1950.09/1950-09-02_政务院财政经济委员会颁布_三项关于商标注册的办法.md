    Three Measures Regarding Trademark Registration
            Detailed Implementing Rules for the Provisional Trademark Registration Regulations

    [Xinhua News Agency News] The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has promulgated the detailed implementing rules for the Provisional Trademark Registration Regulations. The full text is as follows:

    Article 1 These detailed rules are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 34 of the Provisional Trademark Registration Regulations (hereinafter referred to as the Registration Regulations).

    Article 2 When applying for trademark registration, for each trademark, two copies of the application form shall be filled out. One copy, along with the registration fee, shall be sent directly to the Central Private Enterprise Bureau of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and shall be accompanied by ten copies of the design and one printing plate (the printing plate can also be made by the Central Private Enterprise Bureau on behalf of the applicant, with a plate-making fee attached). The other copy, along with two copies of the design, shall be sent to the local commercial administrative authority for record.

    The commercial administrative authority mentioned in the preceding paragraph refers to the Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce or the Bureau of Commerce in a city, and the County People's Government in a county.

    Article 3 Trademark designs shall be printed on smooth and durable paper. The length and width shall not exceed 16 centimeters (approximately 4.8 Chinese inches). The color of the design shall be the actual color used.

    Article 4 When applying for trademark registration, the commodity used shall be clearly stated in the application form according to the categories specified in the Commodity Classification Table.

    Article 5 If the same applicant uses one trademark for different categories of goods, fees and documents must be paid and registration applied for separately for each category.

    Article 6 When a municipal or county commercial administrative authority receives an application form, if it finds that the information is not truthfully filled out, or that the design does not match the actual use, it shall submit its opinions to the Central Private Enterprise Bureau.

    Article 7 The Central Private Enterprise Bureau may, if it deems necessary, notify the applicant to submit a description of the trademark, samples of the goods, or other attachments.

    Article 8 The application date for trademark registration shall be based on the date stamp of the post office of the sending location. If it is not sent through the post office, the date of receipt by the Central Private Enterprise Bureau shall prevail.

    Article 9 If matters concerning trademark applications do not comply with the provisions of the Registration Regulations or these detailed rules, the Central Private Enterprise Bureau may notify the applicant to make corrections within a prescribed period.

    Article 10 Anyone who has no domicile or place of business within China shall, when applying for trademark registration, entrust a person with legitimate business or profession within China as an agent.

    If the applicant in the preceding paragraph is a foreigner, a certificate of nationality shall also be submitted. The power of attorney of the agent, certificate of nationality, or other documents must be in Chinese, but a foreign language original may be attached for reference.

    Article 11 Those applying for trademark registration in accordance with the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 4, Paragraph 7, or Paragraph 8, proviso of the Registration Regulations shall submit verification documents.

    Article 12 Those who, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Registration Regulations, combine with a trademark that has been examined and approved or registered, shall use the examined and approved or registered trademark as the main trademark.

    Those who combine with a registered trademark shall attach the original registration certificate when applying. After approval, the registered number of the combined trademark shall be filled in, stamped, and returned.

    Article 13 The graphics, text, and designated commodities of a trademark that has been examined and approved or registered shall not be changed.

    Article 14 When the exclusive period of a trademark expires, the registrant shall apply for continued exclusive use four months before the expiration date.

    Article 15 If there is a change in the applicant's name, business name, domicile, or seal in the application, the Central Private Enterprise Bureau shall be notified immediately and a record shall be filed with the local commercial administrative authority. If there is a change of agent, or if there is a change in their domicile or seal, the Central Private Enterprise Bureau shall be notified immediately.

    Article 16 The date of receipt by the Central Private Enterprise Bureau shall be the date for submitting objections and related documents. A duplicate of the aforementioned documents shall be attached.

    Article 17 The Central Private Enterprise Bureau shall send the objection and re-objection adjudication letters to the petitioner and the other party.

    Any documents that the Central Private Enterprise Bureau is unable to deliver shall be announced in the Trademark Gazette. Delivery shall be deemed completed 30 days after the date of publication in the Gazette.

    Article 18 For all trademarks that have been examined, rejected, or registered, the Central Private Enterprise Bureau shall send the examination letter, rejection notice, or registration certificate to the local commercial administrative authority for forwarding.

    Article 19 For all registered trademarks that have been revoked due to objection, the Central Private Enterprise Bureau shall notify the local commercial administrative authority to order the return of the registration certificate and announce it in the Trademark Gazette.

    In the event that the exclusive right to a trademark is extinguished due to closure or change of business, the local commercial administrative authority shall collect its registration certificate and forward it to the Central Private Enterprise Bureau for cancellation.

    Article 20 All registered trademarks shall indicate the registration number on the trademark. Those who have not registered shall not misuse the words "registered trademark" or use them in advertisements, signboards, and transaction documents.

    Article 21 If a trademark registration certificate is lost or damaged, the registrant may state the reasons and attach supporting documents to apply for a replacement.

    After the replacement registration certificate is issued, the old certificate will be announced as invalid in the Trademark Gazette.

    Article 22 The trademark registration fee and replacement certificate fee are stipulated as follows:

    1. Application for registration: RMB 500,000 per item.

    2. Application for transfer of registration: RMB 300,000 per item.

    3. Application for reissue of registration certificate: RMB 100,000 per item.

    The aforementioned fees may be increased or decreased at any time depending on the actual situation, as determined by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council.

    The aforementioned objections shall be adjudicated based on the principle of order of use.
