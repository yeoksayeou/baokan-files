　　Several Issues in the Southwest Rectification Movement
    Xin Lu
    The main method of the rectification movement should be to examine and summarize work, that is, to take the policies and instructions of the Party and the government as the standard, and conduct self-examination and summarization of the actual work in the past six months from top to bottom, level by level. Through examining and summarizing work, we should analyze the situation, clarify right and wrong, promote achievements, and correct mistakes, in order to educate cadres and improve work. Leading cadres must set an example, personally take action, and effectively grasp the correct methods of rectification. Only in this way can we ensure the victorious completion of the rectification movement. This has been very clearly instructed in the People's Daily editorial.
    Judging from the current rectification movement in various parts of Southwest China, it can be said that most have grasped this correct leadership method. Many leading cadres of agencies have been able to set an example, personally lead, and earnestly examine and summarize the work in the past six months in the movement, so that cadres have improved politically and ideologically.
    However, many leading cadres have not grasped this correct method, thus causing the rectification to take detours with little effect. This is mainly manifested in the following issues:
    First, some leading cadres have placed rectification in stark opposition to work, failing to deeply recognize that rectification is precisely for effectively improving the political and ideological level of cadres and improving work. Therefore, they emphasize being busy with work and adopt a bureaucratic attitude of indifference towards rectification. Some units have not started rectification at all; some have started but then stopped, or formed into a spontaneous flow, resulting in prolonged time with little effect. The reasons for this deviation, in addition to the lack of importance attached to rectification by some leading cadres, also indeed exist in the work methods. That is, being busy coping with the immediate daily work, and not being good at correctly combining the current work tasks with the rectification movement. In the rectification in southern Sichuan, it was reviewed that the Southern Sichuan Bank "issued more than 100 instructions in a month, but only about ten were realized." If this situation is true, it can be said that much of our leadership agencies' precious energy is wasted. This work method exists to varying degrees in many of our leading agencies, which is the main obstacle to improving work. Obviously, this attitude of emphasizing being busy with work while not paying attention to rectification is wrong. If these comrades can have the determination to change their work methods, plan their work well, allocate energy appropriately, and be good at grasping the main and relaxing the secondary, then not only will they have time for rectification, but they can also rectify very well. This has been proven in many units. Of course, the busy and pressing nature of work tasks cannot be denied, and many important tasks must also be handled in a timely manner. This requires leading comrades to take out a certain amount of time and energy in the rectification movement to take care of daily work, and to grasp the main problems in the current work during the movement.
    Second, some units have adopted the method of examining and summarizing work in form, but the connection with actual work is very insufficient. Some have not grasped the main problems currently existing and conducted a full, realistic study and review, but have focused on the examination of personal thoughts; some, in the examination, only look for shortcomings and do not mention advantages, do not distinguish between the importance and size of problems, and lack specific negative and positive analysis, so the movement cannot continue to deepen after it is launched. For example, some have reviewed many ideological activities in the rectification, added many principles, but the effect on work improvement afterwards is very small; some have admitted all the shortcomings and errors in principle, but are at a loss as to how to correct them; some feel that there are only shortcomings after the rectification, shrink back, and lack confidence in correcting shortcomings, and so on. The reason for this problem is mainly that the leadership does not grasp the movement tightly enough and lacks specific organization and leadership. Therefore, the leadership of the rectification movement in the future must firmly grasp the correct rectification methods. Especially after the movement has been launched, leading comrades must focus all their energy on paying attention to the development of the movement, carefully studying the problems exposed in the movement, and promptly guiding them, so that rectification and review of actual work are more closely linked. It is right and completely necessary to link the examination of personal policies, thoughts, and work style with the examination and summary of work; but it is wrong to examine thoughts in isolation, apart from actual work. In the review, leading comrades must grasp the more important issues and help and guide everyone to conduct specific reviews and analyses, so that cadres can truly solve problems ideologically. At the same time, we must pay close attention to protecting the enthusiasm of cadres, that is, we must appropriately point out their achievements and advantages, and carry out criticism and self-criticism on the basis of giving play to the enthusiasm of cadres, in order to more effectively correct the shortcomings and errors of cadres.
    Third, some leading cadres lack the spirit of self-criticism of setting an example, and do not conduct self-examination level by level from top to bottom, but simply rectify subordinates, so they cannot fully promote democracy and listen to the opinions of subordinates; some lightly let go of the opinions raised by subordinates without studying and handling them, which affects the movement from being well-developed. According to the report of the Southern Sichuan District Committee, some district committees did not grasp the principle of first conducting examination and summary from the leading agencies, so the rectification effect was not significant, and they had to redo it later. Related to this is the erroneous thinking that "superiors do not examine, and neither do I" existing in some lower-level cadres, and the opposition of completing tasks and implementing policies, believing that to complete tasks, one must violate policies. Obviously, both of the above attitudes are wrong, and the two are related. The main reason is that these comrades have not clearly recognized that the purpose of rectification is to educate and improve cadres and improve work, and the method of rectification is for everyone to realistically examine and summarize work from various different perspectives, so that varying degrees of personal complaints and dissatisfaction are mixed in. In some units, if this is not correctly resolved, it is impossible to conduct in-depth rectification. The solution is mainly to seriously open up the thinking of leading cadres at all levels from top to bottom, so that leading cadres at all levels can humbly listen to the opinions of subordinates and earnestly conduct self-criticism. This will not only make the backbone of the Party get improved first, but also effectively inspire and promote rectification below. Practical experience from various places proves that all those who have proceeded according to the above methods have broken through the ideological obstacles of cadres' rectification, and the movement has been able to proceed smoothly, while those who have not proceeded in this way have always stagnated the movement. At the same time, the leadership must also conduct in-depth mobilization of comrades below, and it must also be noted that the further down the level of the agency, due to the limitations of the cadres' level, the more specific help from the leadership is needed.
    At present, the rectification movement has been fully launched in various agencies and departments in Southwest China. Whether the rectification plan can be successfully completed depends on whether the correct leadership guidelines for rectification can be grasped.

### 西南整风运动中几个问题

　　西南整风运动中几个问题
    辛鲁
    整风的主要方法应该是检查和总结工作，就是说要以党和政府的政策指示为标准，针对半年来的实际工作，进行自上而下的逐级的检讨和总结。通过检查和总结工作，来分析情况、弄清是非、发扬成绩、改正错误，以达到教育干部和改进工作的目的。领导干部则必须以身作则，亲自动手，切实掌握正确的整风方法。只有如此，才能保证整风运动的胜利完成。这在人民日报的社论中已经指示的非常清楚。
    从目前西南各地的整风运动来看，可以说大都掌握了这一正确的领导方法。许多机关的领导干部都能够以身作则，亲自领导，在运动中认真的检查和总结了半年来的工作，使干部在政治上思想上都有提高。
    但是也有不少的领导干部没有掌握住这种正确的方法，因而使整风走了弯路，收效不大。这主要表现在以下几个问题上：
    第一、有的领导干部把整风与工作截然对立起来，没有深刻的认识到整风正是为了有效的提高干部的政治思想水平和改进工作，因而强调工作忙，对整风采取漠不关心的官僚主义的态度。有的单位根本没有整起来；有的整起来又停顿下去，或形成自流，结果拖长了时间，而收效很小。产生这种偏向的原因，除了由于某些领导干部对整风重视不够外，工作方法上也的确存在着问题。这就是忙于应付眼前的日常工作，而不善于把当前的工作任务与整风运动正确的结合起来。在川南整风中曾检讨到川南银行“在一个月中曾发出一百多件指示，而能实现的只有十来件”。如果这一情况是真实的话，可以说我们的领导机关有许多可贵的精力是浪费了。这种工作方法在我们许多领导机关中都或轻或重的存在着，这是改进工作的主要障碍。很显然，这种强调工作忙而不重视整风的态度是错误的。如果这些同志能够有决心把工作方法改变一下，将工作计划好，精力分配恰当，善于抓紧主要的放松次要的，则不但有时间整风，而且可以整的很好。这是在许多单位中已得到证明的。当然工作任务的忙迫是不能否认的，有许多重要工作也必须及时加以处理。这就需要领导同志在整风运动中拿出一定的时间和精力来照管日常工作，并且在运动中要掌握解决当前工作中的主要问题。
    第二、有的单位在形式上采用了检查与总结工作的整风方法，实际上和实际工作的联系是很不够的。有的是没有抓到当前存在的主要问题加以充分的实事求是的研究和检讨，而偏重了对个人思想的检查；有的在检查中又是专找缺点不提优点，不分问题的轻重大小，缺乏具体的反面与正面的分析，因而运动展开以后不能继续深入。比如有的在整风中检讨了许多思想活动，加了许多原则，而事后对工作改进的成效却很小；也有的对缺点错误原则上都承认了，但对如何改正则是茫然的；有的整风后感到都是缺点，缩手缩足，对改正缺点缺乏信心等等。发生这种毛病的原因，主要是领导方面对运动掌握的不够紧，缺乏具体的组织与领导。因此，今后整风运动的领导，必须紧紧掌握正确的整风方法。特别在运动已经展开之后，领导同志必须以全副精力来注视运动发展的动向，精心研究运动中所暴露出来的问题，及时加以指导，使整风和检讨实际工作更密切的结合起来。从检查和总结工作中联系检查个人政策思想和作风是对的，而且是完全必要的；但抛开实际工作、孤立的检讨思想则是错误的。在检讨中，领导同志必须抓紧比较重要的问题，并帮助和引导大家进行具体的检讨和分析，使干部真正从思想上解决问题。同时要切实注意保护干部的积极性，就是说要适当的指出其成绩和优点，在发挥干部积极性的基础上开展批评和自我批评，才能更有效的纠正干部的缺点和错误。
    第三、有的领导干部缺乏以身作则的自我批评精神，不是自上而下的逐级进行检讨，而是单纯整下级，因而不能充分发扬民主倾听下级的意见；有的对下边提的意见轻轻放过，不加研究处理，影响到运动不能很好展开。据川南区党委的报告，有的地委就因为没有掌握首先从领导机关进行检查总结的方针，而使整风效果不大，后来又不得不重新进行。与此相联系的，是在一部分下级干部中存在着“上级不检讨，自己也不检讨”的错误思想，并且把完成任务与执行政策对立起来，认为要完成任务就不能不违犯政策。很显然，以上两种态度都是错误的，而两者又是相联系的。其主要原因是这些同志没有明确认识到整风的目的是为了教育提高干部、改进工作，整风方法是大家从各种不同的角度上来实事求是的检查和总结工作，以致掺杂不同程度的个人抱怨和不满在内。这在某些单位来说，如果不加以正确解决则深入的进行整风是不可能的。解决办法主要是自上而下的认真打通各级领导干部思想，使各级领导干部都能虚心的倾听下级意见，认真进行自我批评。这不但会使党的骨干部分首先得到提高，而且能有效的启发与推动下边整风。从各地的实际经验证明，凡是按照上述方法进行的，都打破了干部整风的思想障碍，运动也得以顺利开展，而没有这样进行的，则运动始终停滞不前。同时，领导上也必须对下边同志进行深入动员，还须注意越到下层机关，由于干部水平所限，就越需要领导上更具体的帮助。
    目前整风运动已在西南各机关各部门全面展开，能否胜利的完成整风计划，决定的关键就在于能否掌握正确的整风领导方针。
