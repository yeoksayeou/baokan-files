　　*Dialectics of Nature*
　　Engels' famous book *Dialectics of Nature* has recently been published by Sanlian Bookstore. This book was completely re-translated and proofread by Zheng Yili based on the new compilation of the Soviet Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute in 1949. The new version of the Soviet Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute was compiled after careful study and thorough understanding of the entire process of Engels' writing of *Dialectics of Nature* and all documents related to the dialectics of nature. It fully realized Engels' original plan to complete *Dialectics of Nature*. The book also includes three manuscripts that were not included in the new 1949 Soviet compilation. The publication of this book will undoubtedly make a great contribution to the natural science community in our country.
