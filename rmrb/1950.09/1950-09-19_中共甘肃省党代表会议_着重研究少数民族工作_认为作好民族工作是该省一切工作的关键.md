Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 17th: The first Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Gansu Provincial Committee focused on studying the province's work related to ethnic minorities. The congress lasted a month and concluded victoriously on August 25th. Based on the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee and the enlarged meeting of the CPC Central Committee Northwest Bureau, the meeting reviewed and summarized Gansu Province's work over the past year, particularly focusing on reviewing and deploying work related to ethnic minorities.

The meeting pointed out: Gansu Province is not only a province with multiple ethnic groups (including Han, Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Tatar, Kazakh, Salar, and Tu), but also a region where successive reactionary ruling classes instigated the most intense hatred and killings between various ethnic groups, especially between the Han and Hui people. Deep divisions and hatred exist between the ethnic groups, particularly between the Hui and Han people, which is the reason for the particular complexity of the province's ethnic issues.

The meeting considered that the province had achieved great success in its work related to ethnic minorities over the past year. In the past year, the province has cultivated and promoted more than 1,300 ethnic minority cadres. Joint ethnic power and ethnic regional autonomous power have been established in areas where ethnic groups live together and where ethnic groups live in concentrated communities. Riots incited by bandits and secret agents in Linxia, Pingliang, and other places that took on ethnic characteristics have been quelled and properly handled; the customs and habits of various ethnic groups have been respected. Because the policies of ethnic equality and mutual assistance have been implemented in all work, a new atmosphere of friendship and unity among all ethnic groups has begun to emerge.

The meeting also reviewed the many shortcomings and errors that have occurred in the execution of ethnic policies and in the work of ethnic minorities by party organizations at all levels over the past year. The meeting used the implementation of ethnic policies by the CPC Linxia Prefectural Committee as a typical example to focus on examining the leadership of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee. The meeting pointed out that at the beginning of the province's liberation, the Provincial Committee did not pay enough attention to ethnic work. The Provincial Committee neither conducted extensive education on ethnic policies among cadres nor conducted investigations on ethnic conditions among the masses. The Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee did not specifically discuss ethnic minority issues. Therefore, it failed to formulate appropriate work guidelines and steps based on the ethnic conditions and characteristics of the Linxia region, and rashly and impatiently carried out certain social reforms. It failed to promptly approve and inspect the Linxia Prefectural Committee's report in September of last year, which had significant shortcomings and errors, especially when it began to discover that Hui and Han people were killing each other and that party members and cadres were seriously violating policies in the work of collecting guns and suppressing bandits. It failed to take timely measures to correct them, so that lurking bandits and secret agents took the opportunity to launch riots.

Based on the experience of the past year, the meeting believed that correctly resolving ethnic issues is the key to doing a good job in all work in Gansu Province. Based on the current level of awareness of the ethnic minority people and the conditions of cadres, the meeting clearly pointed out that in the future, in ethnic work, we must adhere to the principle of prudence and steady progress, and oppose rash and impatient emotions. The policy of ethnic equality and unity must be implemented in all departments. To this end, the meeting believed that first of all, all ethnic groups should have an appropriate number of representatives participating in the work of people's governments at all levels, especially in the leadership of people's governments. When absorbing representatives of ethnic minorities to participate in work, the proportion of cadres of various ethnic groups should be adapted to the local population of various ethnic groups, and conscious attention should be paid to the ethnic groups with smaller populations in the area. The meeting believed that cultivating and promoting ethnic minority cadres is a fundamental link in thoroughly resolving ethnic issues. We must correct the erroneous perceptions of some party members and cadres that ethnic minority cadres have low levels of education and are not qualified enough. Secondly, it is necessary to carry out the united front work and mass work among ethnic minorities. The meeting believed that in the representative conferences of various ethnic groups and in the power organs above the county level, an appropriate number of upper-class people of ethnic minorities must be united to participate in the work, and they must be sincerely helped politically and appropriately taken care of in their lives. Disputes between various ethnic groups, tribes, and religious sects should be resolved through mediation to achieve the goal of unity. In addition, mass organizations should be established in various ethnic minorities in a planned and focused manner through various mass movements. On the basis of the great unity of all ethnic groups, carry out production, suppress bandits, eliminate special agents, and run various necessary and possible economic, cultural, and other social welfare undertakings.

　　中共甘肃省党代表会议
    着重研究少数民族工作
    认为作好民族工作是该省一切工作的关键
    【新华社西安十七日电】中国共产党甘肃省首届党代表会议，着重地研究了该省的少数民族工作。这个会议共历时一月，于八月二十五日胜利闭幕。会议根据中共中央三中全会和中共中央西北局扩大会议的精神，检查并总结了甘肃省一年来的工作，特别是着重地检讨与布置了少数民族工作。
    会议指出：甘肃省不仅是多民族的省份（包括汉族、回族、蒙族、藏族、维吾尔族、塔塔尔族、哈萨克族、萨拉族、土族等），而且是历代反动统治阶级挑拨各民族人民特别是汉回两民族人民仇杀最激烈的地区，各民族之间特别是回汉两民族人民之间存在着很深的隔阂和仇恨，这是造成该省民族问题特别复杂的原因。
    会议认为：该省一年来的少数民族工作是有很大成绩的。这一年来该省总共提拔和培养了一千三百余名少数民族的工作干部；在民族杂居和民族聚居地区，开始建立了各民族联合政权和民族区域自治政权；平息和妥善地处理了临夏、平凉等地土匪特务煽动的带民族性的骚乱事件；各民族的风俗习惯受到尊重。由于在各项工作中贯彻了民族平等互助的政策，因而开始出现了各民族友爱团结的新气象。
    会议同时检讨了一年来各级党的组织，在执行民族政策及在少数民族工作中所发生的许多缺点和错误。会议以中共临夏地委执行民族政策的情况作为典型，着重检查了该省中共省委的领导。会议指出：在该省解放初期，省委对民族工作是不够重视的。省委既没有在干部中广泛进行有关民族政策的教育，也没有在群众中进行有关民族情况的调查，省委常委会对于少数民族问题，也没有专门进行过讨论；因此未能根据临夏地区的民族情况和特点，规定适当的工作方针和步骤，而轻率急躁地进行了某些社会改革；对临夏地委去年九月带有重大缺点和错误的报告，未能及时批复并检查其工作，特别是当开始发现回汉人民互相仇杀及党员干部在收枪和剿匪工作中严重违犯政策的错误时，未能及时采取措施，予以纠正，以致潜伏的土匪特务乘隙而起，酿成骚乱事件。
    会议根据一年来的经验认为：正确地解决民族问题，是作好甘肃省一切工作的关键。会议根据目前少数民族人民群众觉悟程度和干部条件等，明确指出：今后在民族工作上，必须坚持慎重稳进方针，反对轻率急躁情绪；要把民族平等团结的政策，贯彻到各个部门的工作中去。为此，会议认为：首先要使各民族都有适当数量的代表参加各级人民政府工作，特别是参加人民政府的领导工作。在吸收少数民族代表参加工作时，应使各民族干部与当地各民族人口比例相适应，并要有意识地照顾当地人数较少的民族。会议认为：培养和提拔少数民族干部，是彻底解决民族问题的一个基本环节。必须纠正某些党员干部认为少数民族干部文化低、资格浅等错误认识。其次，要开展少数民族中的统一战线工作和群众工作。会议认为：在各民族各界代表会议和县以上的政权机关中，必须团结适当数量的少数民族的上层人士参加工作，要在政治上热诚地帮助他们，并在生活上适当地照顾他们。对各民族、各部落、各教派之间的纠纷，应采取调解方针，达到团结的目的。此外，并应通过各种群众运动，有计划有重点地在各少数民族中建立群众组织。在各民族大团结的基础上，进行生产、剿匪、肃清特务等工作，并兴办各种必需与可能兴办的经济文化及其它社会福利事业。
