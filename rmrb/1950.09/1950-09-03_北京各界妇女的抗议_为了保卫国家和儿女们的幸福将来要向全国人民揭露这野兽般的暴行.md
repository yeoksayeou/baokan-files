　　Beijing Women from All Walks of Life Protest
    To Defend the Country and the Future Happiness of Our Children, We Will Expose These Bestial Atrocities to the People of the Whole Country
    [This newspaper reports] Beijing women from all walks of life are angrily protesting against American imperialist aggression.
            Women's Federation, Beijing Branch
    Members of the Beijing Branch of the All-China Women's Federation, in order to oppose the atrocities of U.S. planes intruding into our country's airspace and strafing indiscriminately, have automatically organized propaganda teams in groups to carry out propaganda in the streets and neighborhoods, while at the same time expanding the peace signature campaign. For example, the nineteen members of the Third Group in Dongcheng were divided into nine teams, led by 70-year-old Li Huiwen. Within a week, from the 25th to the 31st, they collected 13,731 signatures. Liu Qingyang, chairman of the Federation, and vice-chairmen Li Jiansheng, and standing committee members Niu Xiyuan and Qian Lingjuan also made speeches protesting against American imperialist aggression. In her speech, Liu Qingyang strongly condemned the aggressive provocations of the American robbers and said, "The anti-imperialist struggle of Chinese women for decades has been to create a happy and peaceful new country and new world for our children. Now that we have achieved liberation and victory, we will never allow American imperialism to invade even an inch of our new country's territory. All the sisters of the Beijing Women's Federation not only warmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's accusations and demands to the Security Council, but we must also strengthen the education of our children, and with firm and courageous actions, prepare to meet any aggressors and defend our own country." Li Jiansheng said, "American imperialism's attempt to intimidate the Chinese people with this method is probably completely wrong. On the contrary, since the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, the Chinese people have raised their vigilance and are watching closely, not allowing the slightest conspiracy or violation." She also called on all peace-loving women in China to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda to expose the conspiracies and murderous faces of American imperialism to the people in every corner of the country; and to expand the peace signature campaign, strengthen unity, and fight to the end to defend world peace!" Niu Xiyuan condemned the atrocities of American imperialism as a beastly act, which 475 million Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate. She warned American imperialism to open its eyes and see the steel-like will and strength that the Chinese people have formed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This will and strength can block all atrocities and aggression. Qian Lingjuan said, "We housewives express our utmost anger and protest against the aggressive behavior of American imperialism. We demand that the provocations and atrocities of the U.S. Air Force be punished immediately, and that it be held responsible for compensating all the losses suffered by the Chinese side." (Yi)
            Street Women Representatives of the First District
    At 3 p.m. on September 1st, the Democratic Women's Federation of the First District of Beijing convened a symposium of street women representatives to report on the collection of peace signatures. At the meeting, everyone discussed the brutal crimes of American imperialism invading our country's airspace and killing and wounding our compatriots, expressing great indignation. Zhao Jinshi, a working woman who had mobilized more than 2,800 people to sign the peace petition in recent days, said, "We protest against this mad behavior of American imperialism. We are not afraid of it at all. Isn't Chiang Kai-shek a shadow of American imperialism? If he dares to come, we have the confidence to defeat him!" In the past two months or so, 26,000 citizens in the First District had participated in the signing. Since the women's representatives' meeting in the First District on August 21 passed a resolution to continue to expand the anti-American imperialist aggression and defense of the peace movement, all women representatives have gone out to publicize and collect peace signatures. By August 31, in ten days, they had collected more than 26,000 signatures, most of whom were housewives. This fact shows the great strength of women in the peace movement. This work is still continuing. Women representatives of the First District used symposiums, door-to-door visits, and street and vegetable market speeches to carry out propaganda, and patiently exposed the aggressive crimes of American imperialism to the masses. Chen Ruizhen of the Eight Section mobilized the activists of the entire section into twelve groups to carry out propaganda and mobilization in various hutongs. When He Jian, a representative, spoke to everyone about the crimes of American imperialism in invading Korea, several old ladies shed tears and said, "We Chinese people don't dislike peace, but if the United States really dares to come, we must defeat it!" When Zhang Xiuying went to the vegetable market to promote, the cigarette vendor said, "If I sign, will you give me millet?" She said, "This is more important than giving millet. As the saying goes: 'If the big river has no water, the small river has no fish.' If the world is at peace, we can live a good life. If there is a war, no one can be safe." In this way, she persuaded the cigarette vendor. (City Women's Federation Communication Group)
            Housewives of the Second District
    Regarding the incident of American imperialism invading our country's airspace and strafing our people, peace-loving housewives in the Second District angrily protested at the Second District Housewives' Study Meeting. Gao Yuquan, an old woman who had collected more than 4,000 signatures on the peace declaration, said indignantly, "I am from Shenyang, Northeast China. The Northeast is my hometown. When I heard my daughter say that American imperialism has invaded our Chinese territory again, and that U.S. planes were strafing our people over Antung, I was so angry that my face turned pale. Their beastly behavior is truly evil to the extreme! Although I am old and cannot go to the front line to fight, I will definitely use my mouth to publicize the bestial acts of American imperialism, so that peace-loving Chinese people will unite closely under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party and drive them away. I dare say that I can definitely do this." Zhang Gengze, a 54-year-old woman, also said angrily, "Don't be afraid that our feet are small and our mouths are clumsy. Anyway, the more propaganda we do, the more power we will generate. The more names we sign to protect peace, the more bullets we have, and the more isolated American imperialism will be. It is not enough for us to rely on posters and newspapers for propaganda. Many of our women sisters are illiterate. In order for our sisters to understand the crimes of American imperialism, I am determined to continue to launch the signature campaign and further carry out propaganda work." The determination of the women in the Second District to oppose American imperialist aggression is like what Grandma Gao said: "We must stand up and fight the American imperialist aggressors to the end!"

            Qinghua Family Women's Association
    The Family Women's Association of Tsinghua University in Beijing wrote to this newspaper on August 31, expressing their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's protest against the atrocities of American imperialism, and called on mothers across the country to unite and rise up to win and defend world peace. The letter said:
    Since the American imperialists openly armed interference in our liberation of Taiwan and aggression against Korea, our members have been filled with indignation, and have strengthened their vigilance and understanding through listening to lectures, symposiums, and learning discussions. On August 27 and 29, the U.S. Air Force even successively invaded our northeastern airspace and strafed indiscriminately. This shameless provocation proves that American imperialism is planning to expand its aggressive behavior. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest to the US government and the accusations made to the United Nations, firmly support the just struggle of our People's Government, and absolutely do not allow American imperialism to violate the sovereignty of our motherland. We have suffered the pain of war, and we want to call on housewives and mothers across the country to unite and rise up to protest the atrocities of American imperialism, and to fight for and defend lasting world peace.

            妇女联谊会北京分会
    中国妇女联谊会北京分会的会员们，为了反对美机侵入我国领空滥施扫射的暴行，已自动以小组为单位组织宣传小队，纷纷向街区进行宣传，同时结合着扩大开展和平签名运动。像东城第三组的十九个会员分做九队由七十岁的老大姐李惠文带头，在二十五至三十一日一周之内，共征得签名人数一万三千七百三十一人。该会主席刘清扬，副主席李健生，常务理事牛西园、钱玲娟并发表谈话，抗议美帝侵略。刘清扬在谈话中痛斥美国强盗的侵略挑衅后说：“我们中国妇女数十年来的反帝斗争，就是要为儿女们创建幸福和平的新国家和新世界，现在我们已获得了解放和胜利，更绝不容许美帝再侵入我们新国家的领土的一尺一寸。我们北京妇女联谊会的全体姊妹，不但热烈拥护周外长向安理会提出的控诉和要求，我们更要加强教育儿女，以坚强英勇的行动，准备迎击任何侵略者，捍卫自己的国家。”李健生说：“美帝国主义想用这种手段来恐吓中国人民，恐怕是完全想错了。相反的，中国人民自从美帝发动侵略朝鲜战争以来，已经提高了警觉性，严厉地注视着，不允许丝毫的阴谋和侵犯。”她并号召全中国爱好和平的妇女们，进行广泛而深入的宣传，向全国每个角落的人民，揭露美帝的阴谋和杀人犯的面目；并要扩大和平签名运动，加强团结，为保卫世界和平而奋斗到底！”牛西园斥责美帝的暴行是野兽般的举动，是四万七千五百万中国人民绝对不能容忍的。她警告美帝应该睁开眼睛看看全中国人民在中国共产党领导之下已经形成的钢铁般的意志和力量。这种意志和力量是可以挡住一切的暴行和侵略的。钱玲娟说：“我们家庭妇女对美帝的侵略行为表示万分愤怒和抗议。我们要求立即惩办美国空军的挑衅和暴行，并负责赔偿中国方面所受的一切损失。”（谊）
            一区街道妇女代表
    北京市一区民主妇联于九月一日下午三时召开了街道妇女代表的座谈会，汇报征集和平签名工作，会上大家讨论到美帝侵略我国领空并杀伤我同胞的残暴罪行，表示极大的愤慨。在最近几天内发动了二千八百多名和平签名的劳动妇女赵金氏说：“我们抗议美帝这种发疯的行为，我们决不怕它，蒋介石不就是美帝的影子么！他敢来，我们就有信心一定能把他打垮！”在过去两个多月中一区市民参加签名的原有二万六千人。自八月二十一日一区妇女代表大会通过继续扩大反对美帝侵略保卫和平运动的决议后，全体妇女代表都四出宣传，征集和平签名，到八月三十一日止的十天中，就征集了另外二万六千余人签名，其中绝大部分是家庭妇女。这一事实显示着妇女在保卫和平运动中的巨大力量。这样的工作仍在继续中。一区妇女代表们运用了座谈会和挨户访问、到街头和菜市讲演等方式展开宣传，并耐心地向群众揭露美帝的侵略罪恶。八段的陈瑞珍发动了全段妇女的积极分子分成十二个小组到各胡同去进行宣传动员，贺瑊代表向大家讲美帝侵略朝鲜的罪行时，有几个老大娘都落了泪说：“我们中国人没有不爱和平的，可是美国要真敢来，我们就一定要打垮它！”张秀英到菜市上去宣传时，卖烟的小贩说：“要我签名，给我小米吗？”她就说：“这比给小米还要紧。俗语说：‘大河没水，小河没鱼。’世界和平了，咱们才能过好日子，打起仗来谁也不能安全。”这样就说服了香烟小贩。（市妇联通讯组）
            二区家庭妇女
    对于美国帝国主义侵略我国领空扫射我国人民的事件，爱好和平的二区家庭妇女在二区家庭妇女学习会上，愤怒地提出了抗议。曾征集四千多人在和平宣言上签名的老大妈高玉泉愤恨的说：“我是东北沈阳人，东北是我的故乡。当我听到我闺女讲美帝国主义又侵略咱们中国的领土，美机在安东上空扫射我国人民时，我简直气得脸发了白。它们这种野兽般的行为，真是万恶到顶头啦！虽然我老了，不能上前线去打仗，但是，我一定要用我这张嘴将美国帝国主义的兽行来作宣传，使爱好和平的中国人民都在毛主席和共产党的领导下紧紧地团结起来，赶走它们，这一点我敢说一定能够作到的。”五十四岁的张庚泽大妈也气愤的说：“不怕咱们脚小嘴笨，反正宣传的越广，起的力量就越大，多签一个保卫和平的名字，就好比多了一颗子弹，美国帝国主义就越发孤立。我们宣传只靠贴标语和报纸还是不够的，咱们妇女姐妹们还有很多不认字的，为了姐妹们也都能明白美帝的罪恶，我下了决心要继续发动签名，和再进一步作宣传工作。”二区的妇女们反对美帝侵略的决心，如同高大妈的话说：“咱们要站起来和美帝侵略者拼到底！”（王凡）
            清华家庭妇女会
    北京清华大学家庭妇女会于八月三十一日写信给本报，表示坚决拥护周外长对美帝暴行的抗议，并呼吁全国的母亲们，团结奋起，争取和保卫世界和平。信中说：
    美帝国主义者公开武装干涉我解放台湾和侵略朝鲜以来，我们的会员都不胜激愤，并且从听讲演、座谈会和学习讨论中，加强了警觉和认识。八月二十七日、二十九日，美国空军居然又连续侵入我东北领空，滥施扫射。这种无耻的挑衅，证明美帝是有计划地在扩大其侵略行为。我们坚决拥护周外长对美国政府的抗议及向联合国提出的控诉，坚决支持我人民政府的正义斗争，绝对不允许美帝国主义侵犯我祖国的主权。我们曾经饱尝战争的痛苦，我们要呼吁全国的主妇们母亲们，团结奋起抗议美帝暴行，为争取、保卫世界的持久和平而斗争。
