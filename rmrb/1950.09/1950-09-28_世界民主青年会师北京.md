World Democratic Youth Gather in Beijing

　　On the morning of September 23, 1950, the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth arrived in Beijing. Bucar and his 40 delegation members were warmly welcomed by 7,000 representatives of young workers, students, and soldiers in Beijing at the square in front of the station. Bucar excitedly said to the welcomers: "We are here to cheer for your victories and achievements!"

　　That afternoon, the delegation met with reporters from major newspapers and news agencies in Beijing and expressed their impressions of their two-week visit to the Northeast, saying that they saw Chinese youth, deeply tempered by internationalism, actively working to build their motherland in the Northeast.

　　On the morning of the 24th, 50,000 youth representatives from Beijing held a grand welcome meeting in front of the Taihe Hall. At the meeting, youth representatives from various countries and the Chinese youth representatives who welcomed them unanimously expressed their firm determination to strengthen unity, safeguard world peace, and oppose the imperialist conspiracy of aggressive war. The Chinese youth and youth from all over the world made another oath of peace at their gathering in Beijing.
