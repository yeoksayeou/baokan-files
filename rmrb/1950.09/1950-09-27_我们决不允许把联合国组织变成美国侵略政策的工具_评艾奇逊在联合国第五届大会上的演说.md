　　We Must Never Allow the United Nations Organization to Become a Tool of American Aggression Policy
    ——A Critique of Acheson's Speech at the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly
    In the recent plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly, the US Secretary of State Acheson, wearing the mask of maintaining "peace" and "freedom," delivered a lengthy and rabid speech inciting aggressive war. In addition to repeating hackneyed arguments and continuing to quibble about the crimes of American armed aggression against Korea and Taiwan, he openly advocated preparing for a heinous military adventure against the Soviet Union, the bulwark of world peace and democracy. In preparation for a new war, Acheson also recklessly proposed amending the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, namely the principle of unanimity among the great powers, in an attempt to completely undermine the UN's purpose of maintaining world peace and international security, and to thoroughly transform the United Nations organization into a tool of aggressive war at the service of US imperialism. This is an important component and a serious step in the overall plan of US imperialism to expand its aggressive war. This is a major conspiracy that all the Chinese people and the people of the world should pay serious attention to.
    Acheson's proposal to amend the UN Charter included four suggestions. The first is to stipulate that "when the Security Council's action is obstructed after the discovery of a breach of peace or an act of aggression," an emergency session of the General Assembly should be convened within twenty-four hours of the notification. This means that when the US government wants to use the Security Council to pass a resolution of aggression, and its aggressive activities are obstructed by the Soviet Union's use of the veto, it will overthrow the principle of unanimity among the great powers and directly convene an emergency session of the General Assembly in order to pass its aggressive resolutions and take aggressive measures at will, using the voting machine of the majority according to the will of the United States. The second proposal is for the United Nations to establish so-called "security patrol teams" or "peace patrol teams" to "observe and report in any area where there is a threat of international conflict." According to this proposal, the American aggressive bloc can use the United Nations to conduct espionage and intelligence activities in the territory of any independent country at any time under the guise of "patrols," and use this to fabricate false reports or create incidents in order to achieve its aggressive purpose of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. The third proposal is to force each member state to "designate a portion of its national armed forces as United Nations troop units, give them special training and equipment, and maintain them on a long-term basis to be ready to perform tasks rapidly on behalf of the United Nations." At the same time, "appoint a United Nations military advisor" to plan this activity. In reality, this is to use the name of the United Nations to apportion troops to various countries to serve as cannon fodder for the US's foreign aggressive wars. This method has actually been implemented in the US's war of aggression against Korea, and now it is attempting to implement it on a larger scale. This proposal is actually a replica in the United Nations organization of the aggressive plan of the so-called "Atlantic Treaty" group to establish the so-called "European Unified Defense Armed Forces." This is the United States attempting to expand the "Atlantic Treaty," which is limited to Europe, to the entire world through the United Nations. The fourth proposal is to request the General Assembly to establish a "committee" to "study and report on the methods that the United Nations" may use to take so-called "collective action (including armed action)." According to this suggestion, the so-called "committee" proposed by the United States is bound to usurp the functions of the Security Council and replace the Security Council with an illegal organization completely controlled by the United States. Such a "committee" is of course more easily used by the American aggressors.
    Obviously, all of Acheson's proposals are completely contrary to the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. The United Nations organization is encountering an unprecedented crisis under the conspiratorial sabotage of US imperialism.
    As everyone knows, the United Nations organization was born in 1945 when the anti-fascist war was coming to an end. The United Nations Charter, adopted at that time, correctly reflected the desire of the people of all countries for lasting peace. According to the spirit of the Charter, the United Nations was originally an important organization for maintaining peace and international security. The Charter clearly stipulates that "the main responsibility for maintaining international peace and security is conferred on the Security Council," and the Security Council must maintain the principle of unanimity of opinion among the five permanent members when making important decisions. This is the foundation of the United Nations organization and a guarantee for maintaining world peace. Because, for major issues in international relations, it is impossible to maintain lasting peace without the unanimous opinion of the five major powers, China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. At the same time, among the fifty-nine member states of the United Nations, the majority are under the control and influence of the United States. If the Soviet Union did not retain the power of veto, and the representative of our People's Republic of China could not participate in the work of the Security Council due to US obstruction, then the United States could completely control the United Nations organization and pass any resolutions that the United States wanted to pass. This would not only undermine the possibility of peaceful agreement between major powers based on the principle of equality, but also make the rights of some small countries lose their guarantee due to the coercion of the United States. It can be seen that the principle of unanimity of the five major powers is the soul of the United Nations organization. If this principle is cancelled, the nature of the United Nations organization will undergo a fundamental change, and the United Nations organization as a tool for maintaining peace will essentially die.
    Because the Soviet Union's veto power in the Security Council has always been a serious obstacle to the implementation of its aggressive policy by US imperialism, the principle of unanimity among the major powers in the Security Council stipulated in the UN Charter has always been the target of concentrated attacks by representatives of the American aggressive bloc. In past sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States has continuously instigated its vassal states to propose abolishing the veto power and weakening the power of the Security Council, but none of them succeeded. Now the United States has personally put forward concrete suggestions for amending the UN Charter. Why is the United States doing this so recklessly? This is because: First, the urgent need of the United States to expand its policy of aggressive war has given it impetus. The more actively the United States prepares for war, the more it opposes the UN Charter and the more it wants to make the UN a tool for its aggressive war. This is self-evident. Second, the experience of the US war of aggression against Korea has given it encouragement. When the Soviet representative boycotted the United States' obstruction of the representative of our People's Republic of China from participating in the United Nations organization and withdrew from the Security Council, the United Nations Security Council was used by the American aggressive bloc as a tool for armed aggression against Korea. The US White House's war order to invade Korea was quickly turned into a so-called "resolution" of the United Nations, and the armed forces of other countries were mobilized through the United Nations to join its aggressive ranks. Although some countries have some dissatisfaction with the US's demand for cannon fodder, in the eyes of the American aggressors, this trick is really the best. The benefits of foreign aggression completely belong to the United States, while the name of aggression is borne by the United Nations, and the armed forces needed for the war of aggression are mobilized through the United Nations organization. The US war order is the "resolution" of the United Nations, and resisting US aggression is "violating the resolution of the United Nations," and will instead be given the crime of "aggression." It can not only use the banner of the United Nations to mobilize war, but also use it to cover up the conspiracy of aggression. How clever is this! The American aggressors have discovered a "shortcut" to expand aggression on a world scale in the name of the United Nations from this sinful deal. But since the Soviet delegation returned to the Security Council, the US's wishful thinking has encountered difficulties again. The countries of the democratic and peace camp headed by the Soviet Union have always unswervingly adhered to the spirit of the UN Charter, exposed and opposed the US imperialist conspiracy to use the United Nations for aggression. This is the situation of "the Security Council's action being obstructed" that Acheson spoke of. Therefore, the US government decided that Acheson should openly propose a proposal to turn the United Nations organization into its tool of aggression at the General Assembly. This is the summary of the experience of the US's war of aggression against Korea, and it is also the inevitable result of the US's policy of expanding its aggressive war to the world. The US government hopes that through this step, it will strengthen its so-called "collective security system." In reality, this is the US ruling clique's conspiracy to use the UN organization to coerce other countries to serve its aggressive policy, brew a military alliance to expand the aggressive bloc, and prepare for a new war.
    However, the US conspiracy is bound to be resolutely countered by the representatives of peace-loving countries in the United Nations General Assembly, and will arouse increasing anger among the vast number of peace-loving people in the world. The Chinese people will not hesitate to stand on the position of maintaining world peace, insist on protecting the UN Charter, protecting the UN organization, and opposing the US amendment to the UN Charter and undermining the UN organization. Even if the General Assembly passes Acheson's proposal due to the US manipulating the voting machine of the majority, the people of the world will never recognize it. All the US's conspiracies and tricks are ultimately doomed to be smashed on the rock of the power of the people of the world.

　　我们决不允许把联合国组织变成美国侵略政策的工具
    ——评艾奇逊在联合国第五届大会上的演说
    在最近联合国大会的全体会议上，美国国务卿艾奇逊，带着维护“和平”与“自由”的假面具，发表了长篇鼓动侵略战争的狂言。他除了重复陈腔烂调，继续为美国武装侵略朝鲜及台湾的罪行进行诡辩之外，竟公然鼓吹向世界和平民主的堡垒苏联，准备发动罪恶的军事冒险。为了准备新的战争，艾奇逊又肆无忌惮地向大会提出了修改联合国宪章的基本原则，即大国一致原则的建议案，企图以此来彻底破坏联合国维持世界和平与国际安全的宗旨，把联合国组织彻头彻尾变为美帝国主义御用的组织侵略战争的工具。这是目前美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的整个计划中的一个重要组成部分和严重的步骤。这是全中国人民和全世界人民亟应提起严重注意的重大阴谋。
    艾奇逊关于修改联合国宪章的建议案，包括了四条建议。其第一条是要规定“在发现违反和平或侵略行为而安理会行动遭到阻挠时”，即得在通知发出二十四小时内，召开大会紧急会议。这就是说，当美国政府要利用安理会通过侵略的决议，而由于苏联使用否决权，使美国的侵略活动遭到阻挠时，它就要推翻大国一致的原则，直接召开大会紧急会议，以便按美国的意旨，利用多数表决的机器，为所欲为地通过其侵略性的决议，并采取侵略性的措施。建议案的第二条，是要联合国建立所谓“安全巡察队”或“和平巡察队”，以便在“任何有发生国际冲突之威胁的地区，作观察并报告”。依此建议，美国侵略集团就可以通过联合国，借用“巡察”的名义，在任何时候，到任何独立国家境内，进行特务与谍报活动，并借此制造虚伪的报告，或制造事件，以达到其干涉他国内政的侵略目的。建议案的第三条，是要强迫每一会员国，“在其国家武装部队中，指派一部分为联合国部队单位，加以特殊的训练、装备，并且长期保持以备代表联合国迅速执行任务”。同时，“任命一个联合国军事顾问”来策划此项活动。实际上，这就是利用联合国的名义，向各国摊派兵员，为美国充当对外侵略战争的炮灰。这个办法，在美国侵略朝鲜的战争中，实际已被施行了，而现在则企图以更大的规模来施行。这一条建议，实际上也是所谓“大西洋公约”集团建立所谓“欧洲统一联防武装”的侵略计划在联合国组织中的翻版。这是美国企图把局限于欧洲的“大西洋公约”通过联合国把它扩大到全世界。建议案的第四条，是要求大会成立一个“委员会”，以便“研究和报告联合国”为采取所谓“集体行动（包括武装的行动）而可能使用的办法”。按照此项建议，美国提出的所谓“委员会”，势必窃夺安理会的职权，而以完全为美国所操纵的非法组织去代替安全理事会。这样的“委员会”当然更便于为美国侵略者所利用了。
    显然，艾奇逊的所有这些建议，是完全违背联合国宪章的基本原则的。联合国组织，在美帝国主义的阴谋破坏之下，正遭遇着空前的危机。
    举世周知，联合国组织是在一九四五年反法西斯战争行将结束时诞生的。当时所通过的联合国宪章，正确地反映了各国人民渴望持久和平的要求。按照宪章的精神，联合国原是维持和平与国际安全的一个重要组织。宪章明确规定：“各会员国将维持国际和平及安全之主要责任授予安全理事会”，而安全理事会在作重要决定时，必须保持五个常任理事国意见一致之原则。这是联合国组织的基础，也是维持世界和平之保证。因为，对于国际关系中之重大问题，如果没有中、苏、美、英、法五大国一致的意见，想要维持持久和平当然是不可能的。同时，在联合国五十九个会员国中，多数是在美国操纵与影响之下，如果苏联没有保留否决权，而我中华人民共和国的代表又因美帝阻挠仍不能参加安理会的工作，则美帝可以完全操纵联合国组织，通过任何美国所要通过的决议，这就不仅破坏了大国间根据平等原则进行和平协议的可能，并且将使若干小国的权利，因受美帝的胁迫而失去保证。可见五大国一致的原则，乃是联合国组织的灵魂，取消这个原则，联合国组织的性质就将发生根本改变，作为维持和平工具的联合国组织，实质上就会死亡。
    由于苏联在安理会中的否决权，历来就是美帝国主义实施其侵略政策的一个严重阻碍，因此，联合国宪章所规定的安全理事会大国一致的原则，历来即成为美国侵略集团代表所集中攻击的目标。在过去联合国历届大会中，美国即曾不断鼓动它的附庸国提议取消否决权，削弱安理会的权力，但是都没有成功。现在美国亲自提出修改联合国宪章的具体建议了。为什么美国要这样蛮干呢？这是因为：第一，美国扩大侵略战争政策的紧急需要，给了它以推动。美国备战愈积极，它就愈要反对联合国宪章，愈要使联合国成为其侵略战争的工具，这是不言自明的了。第二，美国侵略朝鲜战争的经验，给了它以鼓励。当苏联代表抵制美国阻挠我中华人民共和国代表参加联合国组织而退出安理会的时候，联合国安理会曾被美国侵略集团利用作为武装侵略朝鲜的工具。美国白宫侵略朝鲜的战令，迅速变成了联合国的所谓“决议”，并且经过联合国动员了其他国家的武装部队，加入了它的侵略队伍。虽然，若干国家对美国催索炮灰的行动，存在着某些不满，但在美国侵略者看来，这个偷天换日的办法，实在是最好不过的了。对外侵略所得到的权益完全归了美国，而侵略的名义则由联合国担负，侵略战争所需要的武装，又经由联合国组织来动员。美国的战争命令，就是联合国的“决议”，抵抗美国侵略就是“违反联合国的决议”，就会反而被加上“侵略”的罪名。既可利用联合国的旗帜动员战争，又可利用它来掩盖侵略的阴谋。这是多么巧妙呵！美国侵略者从这种罪恶的勾当中间，发现了一条假联合国之名而在世界范围内进行扩大侵略的“捷径”。但自苏联代表团回到安理会后，美国的这件如意算盘又感到困难了。以苏联为首的民主和平阵营的各国，始终不渝地坚持着联合国宪章的精神，揭破与反对美帝利用联合国进行侵略的阴谋，这就是艾奇逊所说的“安理会行动遭到阻碍”的情况。因此美国政府决定由艾奇逊在大会上公然提出变联合国组织为其侵略工具的建议案。这是美帝侵略朝鲜战争的经验总结，同时也是美国向全世界扩大侵略战争政策的必然结果。美国政府期望经过这个步骤，来加强它的所谓“集体安全制度”，实际上，这就是美国统治集团阴谋利用联合国的机构，胁迫其他国家为其侵略政策服务，酝酿扩大侵略集团的军事同盟，借以准备进行新的战争。
    但是，美国的阴谋，在联合国大会上必然要遭受到世界爱好和平国家的代表的坚决反击，并在世界爱好和平的广大人民中间，引起日益增强的愤怒。中国人民毫不迟疑地要站在维持世界和平的立场上，坚持保护联合国宪章，保护联合国组织，反对美国修改联合国宪章，破坏联合国组织。即使大会由于美国操纵多数表决的机器，通过艾奇逊的建议案，世界人民也是绝不能加以承认的。美国的一切阴谋诡计，最后是注定要撞碎在世界人民力量的岩石上的。
