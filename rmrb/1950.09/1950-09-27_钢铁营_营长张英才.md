　　“Steel Battalion” Commander Zhang Yingcai
　　Zhao Yushan
　　Excellent command skills, dedication to and creation of tactics, and strong education of the troops have made him achieve remarkable military exploits.
　　In 1945, after Japan surrendered, the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs attempted to seize the fruits of victory and invaded the Shangdang area. We launched the Shangdang Campaign. At that time, Comrade Zhang Yingcai was the political instructor of the 9th Company of the 57th Regiment. The 9th Company was a newly formed unit with no combat experience. When it received the task of attacking the North Gate of Changzhi, Comrade Yingcai led the 9th Company to the North Gate at the base of the city wall that night, immediately dismantling the door panels to block the street entrance. Because the door panels made noise, the enemy discovered them, and grenades were thrown out with a loud bang. The enemy's fortifications were solid on the east and west sides, forming a three-sided enemy situation. After dawn, an enemy division occupied Fen Shui Ling, and the 9th Company was pinned down below, the situation was very serious. The superiors ordered that the occupied houses be connected to prepare for solid defense. The 1st Platoon was to deal with the large bunker in the west, the 2nd Platoon was to deal with the tall building in the east, and each platoon would send a squad to deal with the front. The battle began, and an enemy division, plus the security regiment outside, launched a continuous attack on us under the cover of dozens of artillery pieces, attempting to annihilate us. Comrade Yingcai mobilized everyone to calmly fight back. The enemy's seven consecutive attacks were repelled. In the afternoon, the enemy carried out destructive bombardment with dense artillery fire, many comrades' ears were deafened, and several times the enemy climbed onto the roofs, but were beaten down. In this way, Comrade Yingcai and the new soldiers repelled the enemy's twenty-two charges, holding the position for a day, killing and wounding more than three hundred enemies. After the battle, they were awarded the title of "Iron 9th Company."
　　During the Lüliang Campaign in 1946, Comrade Yingcai was the company commander of the 9th Company. Their regiment was covering the transfer in Dongyang Village. When an enemy division attacked within a hundred meters of the village, the regimental headquarters ordered the 3rd, 8th, and 9th companies to attack simultaneously. Comrade Yingcai led the 9th Company of more than thirty men into the enemy's position, forcing the enemy to retreat. At that time, the 3rd and 8th companies withdrew first, leaving only the 9th Company protruding on the position. The enemy saw that we had few people and counterattacked, the situation was very urgent. Comrade Yingcai ordered a resolute resistance. Later, only more than twenty soldiers and one machine gun remained in the entire company. The enemy surrounded them from three sides, and they were pressed into a one-foot-deep depression, unable to raise their heads. Comrade Yingcai ordered preparations for grenades and bayonets, while personally using a hand-held rifle to sweep at the enemy, and sending out a group to attack. They persisted for four hours, repelling the enemy, until the entire regiment launched a general attack at dusk. In this battle, Comrade Zhang Yingcai won the special-class combat hero medal.
　　In the autumn of 1948, Comrade Zhang Yingcai was then the deputy battalion commander. In order to cooperate with fraternal units in the Suiqi Campaign, they were tasked with blocking the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' Wu Shaozhou and Hu Lian corps. Zhang Yingcai's battalion arrived at the designated location, Xiaozhuang—a small village of less than thirty households.
　　The troops had just rested when Comrade Yingcai saw traces of cars outside the village, judging that the enemy was ahead. He immediately gathered the cadres and assembled the troops to prepare for battle. Sure enough, before the troops could deploy, four tanks had already rushed towards Xiaozhuang. Comrade Yingcai ordered preparations for grenades, not to shoot until within thirty meters, let the tanks pass and then attack the infantry, deploying the 1st Company to the east of the village, the 4th Company to the west of the village, and the 2nd Company as the entire assault force, with each company equipped with a heavy machine gun, building fortifications while fighting. When the enemy rushed closer, they all fired at the infantry. When the infantry collapsed, the tanks also rolled back. After the first attack was repelled, the enemy turned to the east of the village at noon and shelled us, covering the enemy's 85th Division as it attacked our position from the southeast. Comrade Yingcai thought: We have few people and the enemy has many, to hold the position we must take the initiative to attack. So he ordered small-scale attacks, each time with a group or at most a squad, waiting for the enemy to approach our position and then rushing out to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy with grenades. At this time, the enemy was too close to us, and the firepower behind could not be brought into play, we could chase them away, but not too far. When the enemy deployed their firepower, we had already safely withdrawn. Using this kind of small-scale attacks and short bursts of fire, although the enemy was numerous, they could do nothing to us except leave behind some dead bodies each time. So the enemy concentrated the entire army's heavy firepower, rocket launchers, chemical artillery, howitzers, and carried out destructive bombardment of Xiaozhuang. All the houses were on fire, and the thick trees were broken. Dead livestock lay everywhere in the village, and a layer of dead fish floated in the water ponds. Comrade Yingcai's foot was injured by the bombing. The political instructor was also injured by the collapsing wall. After a long bombardment, followed by continuous attacks by the enemy, Comrade Yingcai still insisted on directing the battle with the cadres at all levels despite his injuries. He observed that the enemy's main attack direction was on the positions of the 3rd and 4th companies, so he ordered the 1st Company to send two platoons to increase the mobile force. Usually, a mobile force would not be more than one-half of the total, but Comrade Yingcai flexibly and boldly used three-quarters of the people as mobile forces. At five o'clock in the afternoon, ten enemy tanks circled the village. After the village was surrounded by the enemy, the enemy's entire division attacked. The 2nd Company was cut off, a platoon of the 3rd Company protruded on the position, the deputy company commander and platoon leader were killed, and the positions of the 4th Company and the 1st Platoon of the 3rd Company were also breached, and half of the village was occupied by the enemy. At this critical moment, Comrade Yingcai calmly used his mobile forces, ordering the 1st Company to attack from the north, and two platoons of the 3rd Company to intercept from the south, suddenly突到 the enemy's rear. The enemy was attacked from behind, and immediately became flustered, and the position was recovered by Comrade Yingcai and his men, and an enemy division was also defeated. That day, they repelled the enemy's eleven consecutive attacks.
　　Comrade Zhang Yingcai always attached importance to summarizing actual combat. The post-war summary is the best military teaching material. The summary of the Xiaozhuang battle laid the foundation for the victory in tactics in the Xiaozhangzhuang and Yangweizi battles in the Huaihai Campaign.
　　The encirclement of Chiang Kai-shek's Huang Wei Corps was shrinking, and Huang Wei struggled to break through.
　　On November 28, Zhang Yingcai's battalion took over the position of the 37th Regiment on the periphery of Shuangduiji—Xiaozhangzhuang. Comrade Zhang Yingcai inspected the position and changed the original deployment, accepting the experience of Xiaozhuang, withdrawing two platoons from the 1st Company in the north, one platoon from the 3rd Company in the west, and using the entire 2nd Company as the mobile force, placing all the artillery and machine guns on the flanks. In this way, on the one hand, the infantry behind the tanks could be attacked from the side, and on the other hand, the firepower position was separated from the main position, which could avoid the enemy's destruction.
　　Thirty meters in front of the 3rd Company's position, there was an enemy heavy machine gun, which posed a great threat to the 3rd Company. It had to be driven away. So Comrade Yingcai ordered the 3rd Company to send out a group to attack. Hero Hou Yongfu led two people with two baskets of grenades and explosive packs to seize the enemy's machine gun, eliminate an enemy platoon, occupy the bunker, develop forward along the traffic trench, and eliminate most of an enemy battalion that was reinforcing in the traffic trench.
　　At noon, the enemy's 31st Regiment of the 11th Division and the 53rd Regiment of the 18th Division, with three tanks in coordination, began to attack us fiercely under the cover of howitzers and aircraft. We used mountain artillery to suppress the enemy's firepower points, and mortars and heavy machine guns bombarded the infantry behind the tanks. We repelled the enemy's attack with only three platoons of troops, killing and wounding more than 1,000 enemies, and we only injured more than 40 people. The mobile forces were not even used. At the end of the battle, the 1st Battalion won the "Combination of Wisdom and Courage, Not Giving Up an Inch of Land" award flag. Zhang Yingcai's battalion, as hard as steel, was spread everywhere in the newspapers.
　　In tactical command, Comrade Yingcai is bold, flexible, and creative.
　　In the Huaihai Campaign, Zhang Yingcai's battalion participated in 15 battles. Not only could they defend, but they could also attack, and they successfully completed their tasks every time.
　　The growth of the Steel Battalion is due to both training in combat and education in peacetime. Comrade Yingcai paid great attention to the education of traditional work styles and the cultivation of typical heroic banners. Under the cultivation of the superiors and his leadership, each company, platoon, and squad had its own characteristics, its own combat style, and its glorious history. Therefore, heroes emerged one after another: there was Hou Yongfu's hard-boned squad, there was a model assault squad, there was a model squad for consolidating the troops, there was lone hero Hou Yongfu, shooting hero Ping Lunsheng, assault hero Yan Fuyuan, blasting hero Li Wenyu, and old hero Zhao Baohai. These heroes guaranteed the victory in every battle. Every time a celebration meeting was held, each squad and platoon could receive its own unique award flag. They inspired each other and learned from each other, and all cherished their glory very much.
　　Due to the maturity of ideological education in peacetime, and the development of the hard-boned work style and new heroism, the entire battalion was always full of morale and vigorous spirit in peacetime. In the past year, under the leadership of Comrade Zhang Yingcai and Political Instructor Jia Defa, 34 company-level cadres were produced, platoon-level cadres were always fully staffed, and many cadres were supplied to other units.
　　In addition, Comrade Zhang Yingcai paid special attention to carrying out military democracy, and made a strict review after each battle.
　　Comrade Yingcai said: "If the work is not done well in peacetime, even the best commander will not be able to complete the task in wartime."
　　Due to his outstanding military achievements, Comrade Zhang Yingcai was promoted to regimental chief of staff shortly after the Huaihai Campaign. In 1949, he represented our Second Field Army at the World Democratic Youth Conference held in Budapest, Hungary, and was warmly welcomed by the democratic youth of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.
　　Comrade Zhang Yingcai is from Wanquan, Shanxi. He is 27 years old. He joined the army in 1939 and the Party in 1942. He is currently the acting deputy commander of a regiment in the Southwest Military Region. (Attached picture)

　　“钢铁营”营长张英才
    赵玉山
    优异的指挥艺术，对于战术的钻研和创造，以及对于部队的坚强教育，使他成就了卓著的战功。
    一九四五年日本投降后，蒋阎匪帮企图夺取胜利果实，向我上党地区进犯，我发起了上党战役。当时，张英才同志是五十七团九连指导员。九连是建军不久没有战斗经验的部队，当接受攻击长治北关的任务时，是夜间，英才同志即带领九连摸到城墙根的北门边，当即拆门板阻挡街口，由于门板响动被敌发觉，轰隆一声手榴弹就扔出来了，东面西面都是敌人的坚固工事，形成三面受敌，天亮之后敌人一个师又占领了分水岭，九连被压在下面，情况非常严重，上级命令将占领的几间房子统统挖通连结起来以准备固守。一排对付西面大碉堡，二排对付东面高房子，一二排各抽一个班对付正面。战斗开始了，敌人一个师加上外面的保安团在数十门大炮掩护下向我发起连续进攻，企图消灭我们。英才同志动员大家沉着应战，敌人一连七次进攻都被击退了。下午敌人以稠密炮火对我作摧毁性轰击，不少同志耳朵被震聋了，有几次敌人爬到他们的房上，又被打下去。这样英才同志和新战士击退了敌人二十二次冲锋，在阵地上坚守了一天，杀伤敌人三百多，战斗结束后荣获“铁的九连”称号。
    一九四六年吕梁战役时，英才同志是九连连长，他们团在东阳村掩护转移，敌人一个师进攻到距村子百余公尺时，团部命令三、八、九连同时出击。英才同志带领九连三十余人突入敌人阵地，迫使敌人溃退。当时三连八连先收了兵，只留下九连突出在阵地上，敌人见我人少又反扑过来，情况很急，英才同志命令坚决抵抗，后来全连只剩下二十多人和一挺机枪。敌人从三面包围上来，他们被压在一个一尺深的凹道里，抬不起头来。英才同志命令准备好手榴弹和刺刀，一面亲自用手提式向敌人扫射，并以一个组出击，他们坚持了四个小时，打退了敌人，直到黄昏全团总出击。这次战斗，张英才同志获得了特等战斗英雄的奖章。
    一九四八年秋，张英才同志当时已是一营副营长，为配合兄弟部队进行睢杞战役，接受任务阻击蒋匪吴绍周、胡琏两兵团，张英才营赶到指定地点小庄——一个不满三十户人家的小村子。
    部队刚休息，英才同志在村外见到汽车的痕迹，判断前边就是敌人，马上召集干部并集合部队准备战斗，果然在部队未展开之前，四辆坦克已向小庄冲来了，英才同志一面命令准备好手榴弹，在三十公尺以外不开枪，放过坦克打步兵，布置一连到庄东，四连到庄西，二连全部做突击部队，并每连配属一挺重机枪，边打边做工事。待敌冲近时，一齐射击步兵，步兵垮退了，坦克也滚回去。第一次进攻被我打退之后，敌人又在正午十二时转到庄东向我开炮，掩护敌八十五师由东南向我阵地攻击。英才同志想：我们人少敌人人多，要守住阵地必须主动出击。于是命令小型出击，每次一个组最多一个班，待敌近我阵地时冲出去用手榴弹给敌猛烈杀伤。这时敌人离我太近，后边火力不能发挥，可以撵他一个跑，但不可过远。等敌人展开火力时我已安全收兵。用这种小型出击，短促火力，敌人虽多，但除掉每次丢下些死尸外，对我没奈何。于是敌人集中了全军的重火器，火箭炮，化学炮，榴弹炮，对小庄实行毁灭性的轰击。房子全部着火了，腰粗的大树也打断了，村里各处躺着被打死的牲口，水池子里漂了一层死鱼。英才同志的脚被炸伤。教导员也被倒塌的墙壁砸伤。长久的轰击之后，接着就是敌人连续不断的进攻，英才同志仍与各级干部负伤坚持指挥，他观察到敌人的主攻方向是在三连和四连阵地，就命令一连抽两个排增加机动部队。按平时，机动部队占全体的二分之一就不少了，英才同志灵活的大胆的用了四分之三的人做机动。下午五点钟，敌人十辆坦克围着村子转圈子，村子被敌包围以后，敌人全师进攻。二连被隔断了连系，三连一个排突出在阵地上，副连长、排长都牺牲了，四连和三连一排阵地也被突破，半个村子被敌人占领。就在这千钧一发的时候，英才同志沉着的动用了他的机动部队，命令一连从北面出击，三连两个排从南面截击，一下突到敌人屁股后头。敌人背后受敌，顿即慌乱起来，阵地又被英才同志他们收复了，一个师的敌人也被击溃了。这一天，他们连续打退了敌人十一次的进攻。
    张英才同志一贯重视实战总结，战后的总结是最好的军事教材，小庄战斗的总结给淮海战役中的小张庄、杨围子战斗在战术上打下了胜利的基础。
    蒋匪黄维兵团的被包围圈越缩越小，黄维挣扎着妄想突围。
    十一月二十八日张英才营接替了双堆集外围三十七团的阵地——小张庄。张英才同志巡视了阵地改变了原来的布署，接受了小庄的经验，从北面一连抽回两个排，西面三连抽回一个排和二连全部做机动部队，把全部炮和机枪都放在侧翼。这样，一方面可以侧射坦克后面的步兵，一方面火力阵地与主阵地分开，可以避免敌人的摧毁。
    在三连阵地前面三十公尺处有敌人一挺重机枪，对三连的威胁很大，非把它撵走不行，于是英才同志命令三连小组出击。英雄侯永福带领两个人提着两筐手榴弹和炸药包上去就夺了敌人的机枪，消灭了敌人一个排占领了暗堡，顺着交通沟向前发展，把敌人增援的一个营大部消灭在交通壕里。
    正午时，敌十一师三十一团和十八师五十三团配合了三辆坦克在榴弹炮和飞机掩护之下，开始向我猛攻，我们用山炮压制敌人的火力点，迫击炮和重机枪一齐轰击坦克后边的步兵，仅用了三个排的兵力即打退了敌人的进攻，杀伤敌人一千多，我只伤四十余人，机动部队还没用上。战斗结束，一营获得：“智勇结合，寸土不让”的奖旗，如钢似铁的张英才营在报纸上到处传播着。
    在战术指挥上英才同志是大胆灵活，有创造性。
    在淮海战役中，张英才营共参加战斗十五次，不但能守而且能攻，每次都胜利的完成了任务。
    钢铁营的成长一方面是战斗中的锻炼，一方面归功于平时的教育，英才同志非常注重传统作风的教育，及培养典型英雄旗帜。在上级培养和他的领导下，各连、各排、各班都各有各的特点，各有自己的战斗作风和光荣历史，因此英雄辈出：有侯永福的硬骨头班，有模范突击班，有巩固部队模范班，有孤胆英雄侯永福，射击英雄平仑生，突击英雄阎福元，爆炸英雄李文友，老英雄赵保孩。这些英雄保证了每次战斗的胜利，每当开贺功会，各班、排都能获得自己独特的奖旗。他们互相激励相互学习，都非常珍惜自己的光荣。
    由于平时思想教育的成熟，发扬了硬骨头作风，新英雄主义，全营平时总是士气饱满，精神旺盛。一年来在张英才同志和教导员贾德发同志领导下，产生了连级干部三十四人，排级干部经常满员，且供给了其他单位许多干部。
    此外，张英才同志特别注意开展军事民主，在每次战斗之后，都要做一个严格的检讨。
    英才同志说：“平时工作做不好，战时再好的指挥员也完不成任务。”
    由于战功卓著，在淮海战役之后不久，张英才同志被提升任团参谋长，一九四九年又代表我二野出席匈牙利京城布达佩斯召开的世界民主青年大会，受到苏联及东欧各国民主青年的热烈欢迎。
    张英才同志山西万泉人，现年二十七岁，一九三九年入伍，一九四二年入党，现任西南军区某团代副团长。（附图片）
