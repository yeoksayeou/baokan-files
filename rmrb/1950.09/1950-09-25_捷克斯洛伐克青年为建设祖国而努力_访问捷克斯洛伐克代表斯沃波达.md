World Federation of Democratic Youth delegate Comrade Svoboda, representing Czechoslovakia, brought the concern and love of the youth of his country to the youth of China, and also brought new news about their domestic youth movement. Comrade Svoboda is the editor-in-chief of the Czechoslovak Youth League's official newspaper, "Youth Front," and has been working in journalism since the liberation of Czechoslovakia.

Svoboda first spoke at length about the overview of the Czechoslovak Youth League. He said: When Czechoslovakia was first liberated, advanced youth who had been tempered in the guerrilla warfare against the Hitler bandit gang established the Czech Youth League and the Slovak Youth League. In April 1949, the two youth groups held a joint congress and formed today's unified Czechoslovak Youth League. The Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth, and now has more than 1.1 million members, of which workers account for more than 50 percent. In June of this year, the Czechoslovak Youth League convened its first national congress, which determined that Marxism-Leninism would be the guiding ideology of the Youth League and formulated the general direction of the youth movement in the future. The slogan put forward at the congress was: One million Youth League members, is one million socialist builders.

In recent years, under the leadership of the Youth League, Czechoslovak youth have actively participated in economic construction. In 1945, 250,000 young people participated in harvest teams. In the Two-Year Plan, members of the Czech Youth League built 231 houses for miners, built the village of Lidice, which was razed to the ground by the German invaders, and built two transmission lines. The broad masses of young people responded to the call of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the People's Government, going to mining, machinery and various industrial sectors to work hard for production and construction. Under the education of the Youth League, a large number of labor heroes and model workers emerged from production. Now, more than 60 percent of the Stakhanovite workers in the country are young workers.

This year, at the call of the Czechoslovak Youth League, 25,000 young people participated in the construction of the industrial center of Ostrava in Silesia, 14,000 young people participated in the construction of the Slovak Friendship Railway, and another 22,000 young people participated in the construction of the Youth Dam in the Slovak region. More young people are actively working to realize the Five-Year Plan.

The members of the Youth League are the pioneers of agricultural mechanization. In the first half of this year alone, the Youth League trained 14,000 tractor drivers, which accounts for two-thirds of the existing tractor drivers. In more than 5,500 agricultural cooperatives across the country, and in rural cultural and entertainment activities, members of the Youth League are playing a pioneering role.

Svoboda also spoke about the participation of Czechoslovak youth in the struggle to defend peace. He said: When American imperialism invaded Korea, the youth immediately launched extensive publicity work, exposing the atrocities of American imperialism, and wrote to the "Youth Front" to express their protest and demand that the American troops withdraw from Korea. When the Trade Union Federation and the Youth League called for donations to help Korea, the broad masses of young people immediately responded. For example, the "Youth Front" and the workers of the newspaper's printing plant donated 10 to 20 percent of their wages. Czech youth know that the most effective way to fight is to increase production to strengthen Czechoslovakia's national strength and to strengthen the peace and democracy camp. Therefore, a new production competition movement is underway.

Svoboda concluded enthusiastically: Czechoslovak youth are taking Soviet youth as their model in production. They want to strengthen their ties with democratic youth all over the world in the struggle to defend peace, and they are watching with enthusiasm the great achievements of Chinese youth in building their own country. He said that he must report the moving construction achievements seen in China to the youth of Czechoslovakia, which will greatly strengthen the fighting unity of the youth of China and Czechoslovakia in the struggle to defend peace.

　　捷克斯洛伐克青年为建设祖国而努力
    ——访问捷克斯洛伐克代表斯沃波达
    世界民主青年联盟代表团捷克斯洛伐克的代表斯沃波达同志带来了他自己祖国的青年对中国青年的关怀和友爱，并且带来了关于他们国内青年运动的新消息。斯沃波达同志是捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟机关报《青年阵线》的总编辑，从捷克斯洛伐克解放以来一直在从事新闻工作。
    斯沃波达首先畅谈了捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟的概况。他说：当捷克斯洛伐克才解放的时候，在抗御希特勒匪帮的游击战争中锻炼出来的先进青年们，成立了捷克青年联盟和斯洛伐克青年联盟。一九四九年四月两个青年团体联合举行了统一大会，才组成今天的统一的捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟，青年联盟是先进青年的群众性组织，现在盟员已超过一百一十万，其中工人占百分之五十以上。本年六月，捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟召开了第一届全国代表大会，确定以马克思列宁主义为青年联盟的指导思想，拟订了今后青年运动的总方针。大会提出的口号是：一百万青年联盟盟员，就是一百万社会主义建设者。
    几年来捷克斯洛伐克青年在青年联盟的领导下，积极地参加了经济建设工作。一九四五年有二十五万青年参加收获队。在两年计划中，捷克青年联盟盟员给矿工修建了二百三十一所房子，建设了被德寇夷平的利台斯村，修建了两条输电线路。广大的青年响应了捷克斯洛伐克共产党和人民政府的号召，去到采矿、机器和各个工业部门之中，为生产建设而努力。在青年联盟的教育下，从生产中涌现出大批的劳动英雄和模范。现在全国的斯塔哈诺夫工作者当中，百分之六十以上都是青年工人。
    今年，在捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟的号召下，二万五千名青年参加了西里西亚州工业中心俄斯特拉发城的建设工作，一万四千名青年参加修筑斯洛伐克的友好铁路，另外有二万二千名青年参加修筑斯洛伐克区的青年堤。更多的青年正在为实现五年计划而积极地工作着。
    青年联盟的盟员是农业机械化的先锋。单是今年上半年，青年联盟就训练了一万四千名拖拉机手，这一数目占现有拖拉机手的三分之二。在全国的五千五百多个农业合作社中，在农村的文化娱乐工作中，青年联盟的盟员都起着先锋的作用。
    斯沃波达又讲述了捷克斯洛伐克青年参加保卫和平斗争的情形。他说：当美国帝国主义侵略朝鲜后，青年们立刻展开了广泛的宣传工作，揭露美国帝国主义的暴行，并致函《青年阵线》表示抗议及要求美国军队撤出朝鲜。当总工会及青年联盟号召募捐援助朝鲜的时候，广大的青年立刻起来响应。例如《青年阵线》和该报印刷厂的工人，都捐出工资的百分之十到二十。捷克青年知道最有效的斗争方式，是以增加生产来加强捷克斯洛伐克的国力，来加强和平民主阵营，因此，一个新的生产竞赛运动正在展开中。
    斯沃波达最后热情地说：捷克斯洛伐克青年在生产中正把苏联青年作为他们的模范，他们要在保卫和平的斗争中加强与全世界民主青年的联系，他们满怀热情注视着中国青年在建设自己的祖国中所得到的伟大成就。他表示一定要把在中国看到的动人的建设成绩报告给捷克斯洛伐克的青年，这必将大大加强中捷两国青年在保卫和平斗争中的战斗的团结。（附图片）
