[Beijing News Agency] In order to strengthen the leadership of suburban work and adapt to the new situation after land reform in the suburbs, the Beijing Municipal People's Government reorganized and expanded the Suburban District Work Committee in late August. With the approval of the State Council of the Central People's Government, Chai Zemin and Zhou Fengming were appointed as the Director and Deputy Director respectively, and Wang Chun, Yin Yukun, and ten others were appointed as members.

The suburbs of Beijing consist of 1,666 natural villages, 11 towns, and 17 suburban areas, with a population of over 680,000, of which over 380,000 are agricultural population. After land reform, the enthusiasm of liberated farmers for production is unprecedentedly high, and they are eager to gradually improve production and combine rich production experience with agricultural scientific knowledge. Therefore, in addition to adding agriculture, water conservancy, and forestry and animal husbandry departments to the Suburban Committee, Chen Fengtong, director of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and Le Tianyu, director of the Beijing Agricultural University School Affairs Committee, two agricultural experts, were appointed as members of the Suburban Committee. Because farmers are eager to learn culture and familiarize themselves with national affairs after liberation, and some large towns and suburban areas in Beijing, such as Changxindian, Mentougou, Fengtai, and Chaoyangmenwai, are industrial and commercial gathering areas, where urban and rural material exchanges are frequent and closely related to the economic lives of suburban farmers and other people, the Beijing Municipal People's Government decided to simultaneously strengthen leadership over suburban industry, commerce, culture and education.

In addition to the Director and Deputy Director, the ten members of the Suburban Committee include: Wang Chun, Director of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Yin Yukun, Deputy Director of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, Wu Yuna, Deputy Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Weng Dujian, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, Peng Cheng, Deputy Director of the Municipal Bureau of Commerce, Ma Yuhuai, Deputy Director of the Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs, Wu Chuangchen, Director of the Third Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Su Min, Director of the Organization Department of the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.

　　适应土地改革后的新情况
    京郊区工作委会扩大
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府为加强对郊区工作的领导，以便适应郊区土地改革后的新情况，已于八月下旬改组和扩大郊区工作委员会，并经呈奉中央人民政府政务院批准，由柴泽民、周凤鸣分任正、副主任委员，王纯、殷玉昆等十人为委员。
    京市郊区共有一千六百六十六个自然村、十一个市镇和十七个关厢，人口达六十八万余，其中农业人口占三十八万余。土地改革后，翻身农民生产热情空前高涨，迫切要求逐步提高生产，并把丰富的生产经验与农业科学知识结合起来。因此，除在郊委会增设农业、水利、林牧三科外，并由华北农业科学研究所所长陈凤桐，北京农业大学校务委员会主任乐天宇两位农学专家担任郊委会委员。由于农民在翻身以后急切要求学习文化和熟悉国家大事；京郊一些大的市镇和关厢，如长辛店、门头沟、丰台、朝阳门外等地都是工商业集聚地区，城乡物资交流频繁，与郊区农民及其他人民的经济生活密切相关，所以京市人民政府决定同时加强对于郊区工商业和文化教育事业的领导。
    郊委会正副主任以外的十个委员，除陈凤桐、乐天宇外，尚有：市供销合作总社主任王纯，中国人民银行北京分行副行长殷玉昆，市财政局副局长武韵庵，市文教局局长翁独健，市商业局副局长彭城，市民政局副局长马玉槐，市公安局第三处处长武创辰和中共北京市委郊区工作委员会组织部部长苏民等八人。
