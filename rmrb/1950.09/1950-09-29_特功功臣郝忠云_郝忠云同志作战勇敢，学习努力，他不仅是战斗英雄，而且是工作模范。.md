　　Special Merit Hero Hao Zhongyun
    Comrade Hao Zhongyun is brave in combat and studies hard. He is not only a combat hero, but also a model worker.
    Comrade Hao Zhongyun is from Wenshang County, Shandong Province. His family was a poor peasant family. After his father passed away, he and his younger brother lived a poor and difficult life with their mother. When he was ten years old, in addition to farming his own land, he also had to do some odd jobs for the landlord to maintain their poor life. After the "July 7th" Incident, he joined the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla in 1938. In 1940, the enemy frantically swept through the base areas, and their troops were surrounded by the enemy. Comrade Hao Zhongyun was unfortunately captured. Later, the Japanese sent him to the Fushun coal mine in Northeast China, where he lived a life worse than that of animals. In 1943, he organized more than 20 workers to secretly pass through the enemy's barbed wire fence one night and escaped. He worked as a construction worker in Jilin City for nearly two years. After the "August 15th" Northeast Liberation, he resolutely joined the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, and gloriously joined the Communist Party of China in 1946. Since joining the army, Comrade Hao Zhongyun has always been active and responsible, brave in combat, able to endure hardship, and study hard. He has been awarded one special merit, three major merits, and five minor merits in combat and work. He has now been promoted to deputy battalion commander.
    In January 1947, Comrade Hao Zhongyun returned to the front line from convalescing in the rear, just in time for the troops to attack Lvdafangzi (Lvdafang is a village in Huadian County, defended by an enemy battalion). Because he had not recovered from his illness after returning from the hospital, the company commander asked him to rest in the seventh squad. When the battle began, the seventh squad was assigned to attack, and he followed the seventh squad to participate in the battle. When approaching the enemy's walls, the enemy frantically used firepower to prevent our troops from advancing. At this time, the seventh squad leader was injured, and all the members of the squad lost command and lay on the ground motionless. He immediately automatically took over the command of the seventh squad and encouraged everyone. He ran in the front, leading the seventh squad to rush close to the walls, occupied the enemy's front line, and continued to develop into the street. Suddenly, the enemy in the bunker on the side swept them with machine guns, preventing our advance. Comrade Hao Zhongyun skillfully spotted the blind spot of the bunker, rolled over, and when the enemy's machine gun changed magazines, he stuffed two grenades and the enemy's machine gun into the bunker. With a "bang," three of the five enemies inside were killed and two were injured. He captured a machine gun and shouted to the troops behind. At this time, the troops had all retreated, and the enemy also rushed over from the north. He calmly threw two grenades and retreated. Seeing that Comrade Li Jincheng was injured and unable to walk, he carried Li's weapon on his back and carried him down, retreating all the way to our troops without losing the unit's flag. After the battle, the regimental committee approved a major merit and participated in the first merit meeting of the Dunhua Division.
    After the Dunhua celebration meeting in 1947, the Northeast Summer Offensive began. The first battle for Hao Zhongyun's division was the Sanjiazi battle. This place was defended by the enemy's Changbai Army (reorganized from the East Manchurian bandit army). The first battalion accepted this combat mission. Comrade Hao Zhongyun was happy to hear the news and ran to the battalion to request that the mission be given to their platoon (he was already the deputy platoon leader). The battalion agreed to his request. He excitedly ran back to the platoon to hold an activists' meeting, mobilized the entire platoon, made merit plans, and resolved to fight the battle well. The battle began at night, and his platoon moved very quickly. When the bugle sounded, they had already rushed into the village, and the enemy collapsed and fled. At dawn, he looked at the nearby terrain, judged the enemy's situation, and suggested to the company commander that they should occupy the mountain, otherwise they would suffer if the enemy attacked. The company commander adopted his suggestion and ordered Comrade Hao Zhongyun to take a platoon up the mountain. As soon as they reached the mountain, they discovered that the enemy was also vying for the mountain. He calmly directed the entire platoon to drive the enemy back, and then ordered the first squad to provide machine gun cover for the second and third squads to charge with him. He ran in the front, chasing for two or three miles. He ran fast, and the troops did not keep up, only two soldiers followed him. He stopped briefly, and a grenade suddenly flew out of the ditch in front, wounding the two soldiers. The enemy immediately came over with machine guns. He knocked an enemy down to the ground with his rifle butt and stabbed him to death with his bayonet. He shot and killed another enemy who came up from behind. The enemies in the ditch were panicked. He immediately shouted: "Surrender and spare your lives! The Eighth Route Army is all around, where are you going to run?" The enemy obediently surrendered. He immediately used the enemy platoon leader to shout, and won over seven more to surrender. In this battle, he captured 27 enemies, captured one machine gun, and 13 rifles and carbines. After the battle, the entire platoon was awarded a major merit, and he was awarded one major merit and two minor merits at the merit evaluation meeting.
    In February 1947, after the Faku pursuit battle and the annihilation of the enemy's New Sixth Army's 62nd Division, the troops advanced to the outskirts of Kaiyuan City. At this time, the main force was preparing to attack Siping, and the task given to them by their superiors was to occupy Xinkaiyuan and block the enemy in Shenyang from reinforcing Siping. Xinkaiyuan is located between Siping and Shenyang, on the east side of the Middle East Railway, and is defended by the First Regiment of the Temporary 30th Division of the 53rd Army. The city has been occupied by the enemy for two years. For the past two years, the Kuomintang reactionaries have exhausted the people's blood and sweat to build a high city wall. The city wall and the surrounding area are full of towering bunkers and bunker groups protruding from the ground. Below the city wall is the outer moat, surrounded by barbed wire, stumbling stakes, and foot traps. Within two or three miles, there are landmines and aircraft bombs that can be detonated by electricity. Yihhetun on the west side of the city and the large white building of the flax factory are the enemy's outposts. The large white building is the commanding height of Kaiyuan and the main support for the enemy's defense. They want to use the large white building to control our army's attack on Kaiyuan and ensure the safety of the city.
    Before the general attack on Kaiyuan, the task of the troops was to take down this building first. The first battalion was assigned this arduous task. Comrade Hao Zhongyun immediately proposed that the third company should attack (at this time he was the deputy company commander). Comrade Hao Zhongyun returned to the company and mobilized everyone to actively prepare for the assault. He personally led cadres above the squad level to repeatedly look at the terrain and study the situation. At the same time, in order to dispel the soldiers' concerns during the advance, he wore a snow suit and went to a place a dozen meters away from the enemy's bunker several times to cut off the electric mine wires first. The attack began, Comrade Hao Zhongyun led the third platoon as an assault team, using a sparse "three-three system" combat formation, and passed through more than 400 meters of open ground in 15 minutes without any casualties. Then the first platoon also came up, and he ordered the third platoon to insert itself toward the houses of Yihhetun (between the big white building and Kaiyuan City). Comrade Hao Zhongyun led the first platoon to attack the big white building. When approaching the vicinity of the white building, a bunker suddenly blocked the way. He ordered soldier Chen Dingwei to approach the bunker with quick movements. After a bomb was thrown in, eighteen enemies surrendered their guns. He learned from the prisoners that there were no enemies on the third floor of the white building, so he led the troops to quickly approach the big white building. The staircase had been blocked by enemy fire, so he skillfully directed the soldiers to fire a row of grenades and rushed up in the sound of explosions and smoke. There was no staircase on the third floor, so he carefully looked around and found a cement pier at the corner of the wall, so he organized a human ladder. Comrade Hao Zhongyun was the first to climb onto the third floor, and then the soldiers also climbed up. At this time, several enemies were carrying heavy machine guns to the third floor, but they were immediately disarmed. They shouted slogans at the enemies downstairs on the third floor, and the enemies asked inexplicably: "Who are you? Are you the heavy machine gun squad?" Comrade Hao Zhongyun's reply was: "We are the Eighth Route Army, surrender and don't kill, treat prisoners leniently. Otherwise, we will throw grenades." The enemies were panicked, and seeing that the Eighth Route Army was up and down, they obediently said: "Don't fight, we surrender our guns." Even after the enemies surrendered their guns, they still asked: "How did you get to the third floor?"
    In this battle, more than 20 enemies were killed, 90 enemies were captured, two heavy machine guns, three 60 mortars, and dozens of rifles were seized. The third company received a reward from the division, and Comrade Hao Zhongyun was awarded a special merit in this battle.
    In the autumn of 1948, the main force fought Jinzhou, and our army blocked the enemy Liao Yaoxiang Corps in the area of ​​Dahushan and Daheishan. During the blocking in Dahushan, the task of the third company was to defend the bridge. Comrade Hao Zhongyun carefully looked at the terrain, deployed firepower, and discovered that there was a large ditch of four or five hundred meters in front of the position. If it was not leveled, it would be unfavorable to us. So he mobilized the entire company and took the lead in leveling the ditch overnight. The next day, the enemy really advanced from the direction of that ditch, but the ditch had become a flat open space, and it was not easy for the enemy to advance. He concentrated the firepower of the entire company and fired fiercely, killing and wounding more than 100 enemies in front of the ditch, repelling the enemy and preserving the position. At the war evaluation meeting, he was awarded another minor merit.
    After going south, in the campaign where our army cooperated with the Second Field Army to advance into Sichuan and pursue and annihilate Song Xilian's Corps, after more than ten days of continuous pursuit, the troops caught up with the enemy in Baima, Shilong County. At this time, the enemy was fleeing in a panic. Comrade Hao Zhongyun commanded the troops to pursue fiercely for dozens of miles, and achieved the victory of capturing more than 300 enemies.
    Comrade Hao Zhongyun is not only a combat hero, but also a model worker. In 1947, during the rectification in Yongning (he was the platoon leader), the troops were ideologically confused. Comrade Hao Zhongyun patiently talked to a comrade every day, understood the soldiers' thoughts, united the cadres and activists, and educated the backward elements, so that no one in his platoon deserted. He not only patiently educated the soldiers, but also cared for them very much. He often cooked dishes and delivered meals to the sick, and used his allowance to buy things for the sick. During the march, he gave the leather shoes awarded by his superiors, which he was reluctant to wear, to the soldiers, because he cared for the soldiers so much, and there was no problem in the entire platoon for a long time, which was praised by the superiors, and he was awarded five minor merits in total.

　　特功功臣郝忠云
    郝忠云同志作战勇敢，学习努力，他不仅是战斗英雄，而且是工作模范。
    郝忠云同志是山东汶上县人，家中是个贫农，父亲去世后，剩下他和一个小弟弟跟母亲过着贫苦困难的日子，十来岁的时候，就每年除种自己的地外，还要给地主家做些短工零活，来维持那贫苦的生活。“七七”事变后，在一九三八年他参加了抗日游击队。一九四○年敌人疯狂扫荡根据地，他们部队被敌人包围，郝忠云同志不幸被俘了，以后日寇把他送到东北抚顺下煤窑，过着牛马不如的生活。一九四三年，他组织二十多个工人，在一天晚上偷偷地通过敌人的铁丝网，跑了出来，到吉林市做了将近两年的土工，“八一五”东北解放，他毅然参加了东北民主联军，一九四六年又光荣的加入了中国共产党。郝忠云同志自参军后一贯积极负责，作战勇敢，吃苦耐劳，学习努力。他曾在战斗和工作中立过一特功，三大功、五小功。现已升任副营长。
    一九四七年一月，郝忠云同志从后方养病回到前方，正赶上部队要攻吕大房子（吕大房是桦甸县的一个村庄，敌人一个营守着）。因为他从医院回来病还未好，连长叫他在七班休息，战斗开始了，七班担任突击，他也跟着七班参加了这次战斗。在接近敌人围墙的时候，敌人用火力疯狂的阻止我们部队前进，这时七班长负了伤，全班人失掉了指挥都卧在地上不动。他马上自动代七班长指挥，鼓励大家。他跑在最前面，带着七班冲近了围墙，占领了敌人的前沿，继续向街内发展，突然侧面碉堡里的敌人，用机枪向他们扫来，阻止了我们的前进。郝忠云同志机动的看准碉堡的死角，滚了过去，等到敌人机枪换梭的时候，他将两个手榴弹和敌人的机枪一块塞进碉堡里，“轰”的一声，里面五个敌人炸死三个，伤两个。他缴获了一挺机枪，便喊后面的部队。这时部队已都撤退了，敌人也从北面扑过来，他不慌不忙的打了两个手榴弹便向后退，看到战士李金成同志负了伤不能走，他便把李的武器背上挟着他往下走，一直退到我们部队里，没把彩号丢掉。战斗结束后，团委批准立大功一次，参加了敦化师第一届功臣大会。
    一九四七年敦化庆功会后，东北夏季攻势开始，郝忠云所在师第一仗就是三家子战斗。这里是敌人长白军（东满土匪队改编）守着。一营接受了这次战斗任务，郝忠云同志听到这消息，就高兴的跑到营里要求把任务交给他们排（他已当副排长）。营里答应了他的要求。他兴奋的跑回排里召开活动分子会议，并动员全排，都订了立功计划，下了决心，一定把仗打好。晚上战斗开始了，他排的动作特别迅速，冲锋号响时，他们已冲进了村内，敌人便溃乱逃跑了。天将拂晓时，他看附近的地形，判断了敌情，并给连长建议要占领山头，否则敌人来袭击怕会吃亏的。连长采纳了他的意见，便命令郝忠云同志带一排上山。他们刚一上山就发现敌人也抢山头。他很沉着的指挥着全排把敌人打退了，随即命令一班机枪掩护二三班跟他冲，他跑在最前面，一直追了二、三里。他跑的快，部队未跟上来，只有两个战士跟着他。他稍一停，前面沟里突然打过一个手榴弹来，把两个战士炸伤了，敌人马上端着机枪过来，他用枪托把一个敌人打倒在地上，又用刺刀刺死，两枪又打死后面上来的一个敌人，沟里的敌人都慌了，他马上大喊：“缴枪饶命！四面八方都是八路军，你往那儿跑呀？”敌人乖乖的缴枪了，他马上利用敌排长喊话，又争取了七名投了降。这次战斗他一人俘敌二十七名，缴机枪一挺，步马枪十三支。战斗结束后全排立大功一次，在评功会上给他立一大功，两小功。
    一九四七年二月法库追击战，歼灭敌新六军六十二师后，部队进逼开原城郊，这时主力准备打四平，上级给他们的任务是：攻占新开原，阻击增援四平的沈阳之敌。新开原位于四平沈阳之间，在中长铁路的东侧，有五十三军暂三十师第一团守备。该城已被敌人占了两年之久，两年来，国民党反动派用尽人民的血汗筑成一个高大的城墙，城墙上和城的四周布满了林立的碉堡，和突出地面的地堡群，城墙下就是外壕，四周是铁丝网，绊脚桩和陷脚坑，二、三里路以内都布满了地雷和电发火的飞机大炸弹，城西面的义和屯和亚麻工厂的大白楼，是敌人的外围据点，大白楼是开原的制高点，是敌人守备的主要依托，想以大白楼来控制我军对开原的进攻，保证城内的安全。
    在总攻开原以前，部队的任务，先打下这座楼。一营就担任了这个艰巨的任务。郝忠云同志马上提出由三连来打（这时他当副连长）。郝忠云同志回到连里便动员大家积极作攻坚准备。他亲身带领班以上干部反复的看地形研究情况，同时，他为了扫除战士在前进中的顾虑，自己穿了雪衣，几次到距敌地堡十几米的地方，先把电雷线都剪掉。攻击开始了，郝忠云同志带领三排担任突击队，用疏散“三三制”战斗队形，十五分钟通过了四百多米的开阔地没有一个伤亡。接着一排也上来了，他便命令三排向义和屯房子那面插（在大白楼与开原城之间）。郝忠云同志带领一排向大白楼攻击，接近到白楼附近时，突然发现一个地堡拦住去路，他命令战士陈丁卫以迅速动作接近地堡，一个炸弹投入后，十八个敌人交了枪。他从俘虏中了解到白楼的第三层没有敌人，就带领部队迅速地接近到大白楼跟前，楼梯已被敌人火力封锁，他很机动地指挥战士打了一排手榴弹，在炸声和烟雾中冲了上去。第三层楼没有楼梯无法上去，他便细密的四处观看，发现墙角下有个洋灰墩子，就组织了人梯。郝忠云同志第一个先窜上第三层楼，接着战士们也窜上来。这时有几个敌人抬着重机枪也上三层楼来，被他们一下缴了枪，他们在三层楼对楼下的敌人喊起口号来，敌人都莫明其妙的问：“你们是谁？是重机枪班吗？”郝忠云同志的回答是：“我们是八路军，缴枪不杀优待俘虏。否则就摔手榴弹了。”敌人惊惶了，看到上下都是八路军就乖乖的说：“别打，我们交枪。”直到敌人交枪后，敌人还问：“你们是怎样上的三层楼呀？”
    这次战斗毙敌二十多名，俘敌九十人，缴获重机枪两挺，六○炮三门，步枪几十支，三连获得了师的奖励，郝忠云同志在这次战斗中立一特功。
    一九四八年秋季，主力打锦州，我军在大虎山、大黑山一带阻击敌廖耀湘兵团。在大虎山阻击中，三连任务是坚守大桥。郝忠云同志细心的看了地形，布置火力，并发现阵地前面有一条四五百米的大沟，如果不将它平掉，对我们是不利的。于是他便动员全连，自己带头连夜把沟平掉。第二天敌人果然从那沟的方向前进，可是这沟已成为平坦的开阔地，敌人不易前进，他便集中全连火力猛打，于该沟前，杀伤敌人一百多名，击退了敌人，保全了阵地，战评会上又立小功一次。
    南下后，我军配合二野进军四川追歼宋希濂兵团的战役中，部队经过十几天的连夜追击，在式隆县的白马追上了敌人。这时敌人正在狼狈的逃窜，郝忠云同志指挥部队猛追几十里路，得到俘敌三百多名的胜利。
    郝忠云同志不仅是战斗英雄，而且是工作模范。一九四七年在永宁整训（他当排长），部队思想比较混乱。郝忠云同志很耐心的每天都找一个同志谈话，了解战士的思想，团结干部和积极分子，教育落后分子，使他排无一逃亡。他不仅耐心教育战士，同时非常爱护战士，经常给病号做菜送饭，把自己的津贴费给病号买东西吃，在行军中把自己舍不得穿的上级奖给的皮鞋送给战士穿，因为他这样的关心和爱护战士，全排很久没有发生问题，受到上级的表扬，前后共立五小功。（附图片）
