　　Responding to the Mother's Call to Fight Forever
    ——Remembering the Mother of the People's Soldiers——Rong Guanxiu
    Only those who dedicate their all to the struggle better understand the preciousness of victory and how to defend it.
    Rong Guanxiu's family was a slave's family in her childhood. Her great-grandfather, uncles, and brothers herded sheep for the landlord, her grandmother cooked for the landlord, and she and her mother spun thread and made shoes to sell; the whole family worked hard all year round, but they still often went hungry. Rong Guanxiu is already fifty-four years old this year, but most of her life, like all the peasants in old China, was spent silently in tears.
    When Rong Guanxiu was only fifteen years old, because of the hardships of life, her father sold her to Li You of Shaping as a daughter-in-law for nine strings of cash. However, in that world, poor people suffered everywhere. The Li family relied on renting land to make a living, and often the stove could not be lit even when the sun had set. Although Rong Guanxiu was naturally hardworking, she carried a manure basket to collect manure before dawn all year round, and never rested even on the first day of the lunar new year. She went down to the fields to work only a few days after giving birth. But, alas, in the old society, even such diligence could not bring a good life. Rent was increased on every piece of land reclaimed. When the golden grain was threshed in the fields, the landlord's tall mules took away most of it. Poor people suffered, but who could they tell their suffering to? At that time, they ate large yellow leaves and pig ear grass; they got rid of old greens and picked navel sprouts, which were bitter and thorny. Eating too much would cause the body to swell with bruises, and they couldn't defecate. Rong Guanxiu lived this kind of bitter life until she was forty-one years old.
    When the Anti-Japanese War began, General Nie Rongzhen's troops came to Mount Wutai. In the struggle against the enemy and the struggle for "two-five" rent reduction, the peasants in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region were organized. Rong Guanxiu's husband, Li You, joined the peasant association and became the organization committee member. Their eldest son, Chun Jin, joined the labor union and was elected as its director. Rong Guanxiu was in the women's rescue association, and the members all voted for her to be the chairman. The whole family, big and small, participated in revolutionary work. It was after this that she realized which path the poor should take to turn over; it was after this that they could eat cornbread and vegetable meals; it was after this that they could have lamps to light and salt to eat, and could afford to buy new clothes. Rong Guanxiu understood where a good life came from. She often said: "Don't forget the well-digger when drinking water, and walk towards the good."
    Our Comrade Rong Guanxiu was a respected model of supporting the army during the difficult days of the Anti-Japanese War behind enemy lines. Regardless of wind or rain, she often wrapped cornbread in a towel and held it against her chest, and carefully carried a pottery pot filled with rice soup. She often squatted in front of the stretchers, waiting for every wounded soldier passing by. You might think she just cooks and does chores at home, but her heart is always concerned about the front lines. She understood who the people's soldiers were fighting and bleeding for in the hail of bullets. When making military shoes, she said to the women: "The people's soldiers climb mountains and cross ridges. How can they fight the devils if their shoes are not sturdy?" That woman under the pine also knew that when making military shoes, they should be made as if they were making them for their own children and brothers. Five stitches must be sewn on both sides of the top, and at least 1,400 stitches must be pulled under the bottom. Each pair of shoes must weigh more than one catty and four ounces. When handing in public grain, she walked from one grinding disc to another, saying to the women: "Grind three rounds of coarse rice, pick out the sand, and winnow the grain more times. The army is fighting on the front lines and can't bother to wash it. It's unsanitary to eat it."
    Rong Guanxiu loved the people's soldiers. She not only regarded the people's soldiers as family members, but also regarded their affairs as her own. Sometimes, when the wounded soldiers came down, the men were all out. She and the women, in groups of eight, took turns carrying stretchers on the rugged mountain roads, sending the wounded soldiers to the hospital. In 1943, the government called for people to join the army. Rong Guanxiu went from house to house, persuading women not to hold back their sons. She said, "The people's soldiers belong to us, the common people. Without them, we can't survive." She asked the women, "Do you understand clearly?" The women replied, "We understand clearly!" At the meeting, young people all signed up to join the army, and Rong Guanxiu herself took the lead and signed up her youngest son. She also said, "I don't mind that my family's Li You is old. He can pull a horse for the Eighth Route Army. My third son is not old enough, but I guarantee that one will go for every one that gets older."
    Rong Guanxiu's great maternal love was a concentrated expression of the will of the people behind enemy lines to support the Liberation Army during the Anti-Japanese War. One evening in the winter of 1943, the Jin-Cha-Ji counter-"mopping up" war was in full swing. A seriously wounded soldier came to the village's transportation station. His name was Feng Jianmin. Blood covered his face, he couldn't open his eyes, and his hair was matted into a bloody lump. Rong Guanxiu felt relieved only after feeling the wounded man's nostrils still breathing. At that time, the enemy often harassed the village, everyone was exhausted, and Rong Guanxiu hadn't closed her eyes for two nights and could doze off even while standing. However, she went to the station several times, but the stretcher was still there. The whole village was asleep, and no one could open their eyes anymore. Rong Guanxiu thought to herself, what would happen if something happened to the wounded soldier? So, she found her daughter-in-law Baonü and lit a lamp to accompany her to take care of the wounded soldier.
    The light flickered, the northwest wind was very strong, and the ice on the Wanzi River crackled. Rong Guanxiu squatted by the stretcher and called "Comrade" several times, but the wounded soldier still didn't make a sound. She had no choice but to get half a bowl of boiled water and blow on it for a long time to cool it down. She used chopsticks to pry open the wounded man's mouth, but his teeth were clenched tightly, and the water she poured in flowed all over his neck. After a while, Rong Guanxiu helped him up and poured water again, and the water went down. After drinking half a bowl of water, Rong Guanxiu asked the wounded man, "Do you want more?" In the light, she saw the wounded man move his lips, and Rong Guanxiu was really happy. Then he drank another bowl of water, which Rong Guanxiu had cooled down. The wounded man leaned on Rong Guanxiu and drank it himself.
    It was already dawn. She saw the wounded man's bare feet, which were frozen black and swollen. She went home to find cotton, but couldn't find it, so she tore off the lapel of her daughter's coat and wrapped the wounded man's feet. She also served the wounded man three bowls of thin gruel. This time, the wounded man could hold the bowl himself. Later, the stretcher came. She thickly padded it with rice straw, and only after the wounded man lay down safely did she repeatedly tell the militiamen to take care of him carefully. As the militiamen put the stretcher on their shoulders, they heard the wounded man say, "Good old woman! Good old woman! I will never forget your kindness!"
    Rong Guanxiu not only loved the people's soldiers, but her own third son, Lan Jin, was one of our brave people's soldiers. Comrade Lan Jin is now a combatant in the First Field Army. In a battle last spring, he gloriously performed meritorious service. The good news of his meritorious service came to his hometown from the distant front lines, and the villagers praised, "Truly, the old are heroes and the sons are brave men." The whole family was extremely happy. Especially Lan Jin's wife, Xihua, was three times happier than others.
    Speaking of Lan Jin's wife, Xihua, Rong Guanxiu had raised her since she was a child. Rong Guanxiu treated Xihua like her own daughter. When Lan Jin went to the front lines, Rong Guanxiu said to Xihua, "Coarse cloth clothes and cornbread meals, from now on, we'd rather make things difficult for ourselves than make things difficult for you." If Lan Jin didn't send a letter home for a long time, Rong Guanxiu would say to Xihua, "If he doesn't come back for a long time, you should leave if you want to. If you leave, you're still my daughter." Whenever Rong Guanxiu said these words, Xihua often didn't answer. Once, Rong Guanxiu was writing a letter to Lan Jin, and she asked Xihua what she wanted to write. Xihua lowered her head and still didn't speak. Rong Guanxiu said, "Write a sentence saying that your wife hasn't forgotten you." Xihua didn't answer, Rong Guanxiu said, "Not speaking means you agree." That was indeed the case. Later, Xihua secretly wrote a note and put it in the envelope. The note had two sentences that said, "Our mother is afraid that I won't be able to hold on, but I will always wait for you to come back."
    I asked Rong Guanxiu if she wanted Lan Jin to come back. Rong Guanxiu said, "Why wouldn't I want to?" She paused and said heavily, "But, as long as the enemy is not completely eliminated, Lan Jin must carry out the revolution to the end and cannot come back."
    This is what the mothers of China want to say. Comrade Lan Jin in the Northwest Plateau and the brothers and sisters guarding the borders of the motherland should firmly remember the mother's words, be vigilant, and respond to the call of our glorious mother to fight forever! (Attached picture)

　　响应母亲永远战斗的号召
    ——记子弟兵的母亲——戎冠秀
    只有把自己的全部奉献给斗争的人，才更加懂得胜利的珍贵，懂得应该如何保卫胜利。
    童年时代戎冠秀的家，是一个奴隶的家。二爷爷、叔叔、兄弟给地主放羊，奶奶给地主做饭，她和娘捻线做鞋卖；全家终年辛勤，但还要常常饿饭。戎冠秀今年已经五十四岁了，但她大半生的历史，和旧中国所有的农民一样，是在泪水中默默度过。
    当戎冠秀还在十五岁的时候，因为生活的熬煎，他父亲将他用九吊钱卖给沙坪李由作媳妇。但是，在那个世界里，穷人到处是受罪，李家靠着租种地过日子，也常常是日头落山，灶里还不能生火。戎冠秀虽然生来好劳动，一年四季天不明，她就背上粪筐拾粪，大冷天，旧年初一也从不歇着，生下孩子不几天，就下炕做活。但是呵，在旧社会，就这样勤谨，也得不到好生活。刨一点坡，加一点租，金黄的粮食打在场里，地主高大的骡子要?去大半。穷人受苦，有苦向谁说。那时间，吃了大黄叶吃猪耳朵草；卡了老绿又摘脐里苗，又苦，又有刺儿，多吃身上就青肿，屎也拉不出。这种苦日子，戎冠秀一直过到四十一岁。
    抗战开始，五台山上开来了聂荣臻将军的部队。在对敌斗争和“二五”减租的斗争中，晋察冀边区农民组织起来了。戎冠秀的丈夫李由参加了农会，当了农会组织委员。大小子春金，参加了工会，被选上作主任。戎冠秀在妇救会里，会员们个个举手推她当会长。一家人，大的小的，都参加了革命工作。是这以后，她认识了穷人要翻身，应走那条路；是这以后，才吃上了窝窝菜饭；是这以后，才能有灯点，有盐吃，才能买上个布缝件新衣。戎冠秀懂得好生活从那里来。她常说：“喝水不忘掘井人，走路要往好处走。”
    我们的戎冠秀同志，在敌后抗战严重的日子里，是一个人人尊敬的拥军模范。不管风里来，雨里去，她常常把窝窝用手巾包着贴在胸前，吃力的提着盛米汤的瓦罐，常常蹲在担架跟前，候过路的每一个伤员。你别看她平常在家里烧饭做活，但是她的心可惦记前线。她明白子弟兵在枪林弹雨里，拚命流血为了谁。做军鞋，她给妇女们说：“子弟兵爬山过岭，鞋不结实，怎能和鬼子斗争？”下盘松那个妇女也知道，做军鞋，要像给自己孩子兄弟们做的一样。头上两旁都得缝五道，底下至少拉过一千四百针，每双鞋，上秤总得超过一斤四两。交公粮的时候，她从这个碾盘走到那个碾盘，对妇女们说：“要推三糙米，砂子要捡掉，粮食要多簸两遍，军队在前方打仗，顾不得淘，吃了不卫生。”
    戎冠秀爱子弟兵，她不但把子弟兵看作家人，而把子弟兵的事，也看作有她自己一份。有时候，伤兵下来，男人们都出去了，她和妇女们，八个人一组，在崎岖不平的山道上，轮流抬着担架，把伤兵送进医院。一九四三年，政府号召报告参军，戎冠秀从这家进，那家出，宣传妇女们不要拖尾巴。她说：“子弟兵是咱们老百姓的，没有他们，咱们就活不成。”她问妇女们：“看清了没有？”妇女们答话说：“看清了！”在会上，青年们都报名参军，戎冠秀自己也当了先锋，她给自己小子报了名。她还说：“不嫌俺家李由老，给八路军拉马去，三小子不到年岁，我保管大了一个走一个。”
    戎冠秀伟大的母爱精神，是抗战时期敌后人民拥护解放军意志的集中表现。一九四三年冬天的一个黄昏，晋察冀反“扫荡”战争打得正激烈，村里的交通站上来了个重伤员，名字叫封建民。血糊满了脸，眼也睁不开，头发被结成一个血疙瘩。戎冠秀摸了摸伤号的鼻孔还出气，心里才稍安定。那时敌人经常来村里骚扰，谁都累倒了，戎冠秀也已两夜没有合眼，站着也能打瞌睡。可是，她去站上好几次，担架还在那儿摆着，全村都睡了，谁也没法再睁眼。戎冠秀心一想，伤员要是闹个三长两短，这怎么办，于是，她找了生生子媳妇宝女，点一个灯和她作伴侍候伤员。
    灯光一灭一闪，西北风很紧，湾子河的冰冻得格格发响。戎冠秀蹲在担架边，连叫几声同志，伤员仍是不出声，她没有法子，弄了半碗开水，吹了老半天，把水吹凉了，她拿筷子拨开伤员的嘴，但他牙关咬得很紧，灌下去的水全流在脖子里。呆了一会，戎冠秀把他扶起来，再灌水，水就咽下去了。喝完了半碗水，戎冠秀问伤员：“还喝吗？”灯光里，见伤员动了动嘴唇，戎冠秀可真喜欢。接着又喝了碗水，这水是戎冠秀吹凉了，伤员靠在戎冠秀身上自己喝下去的。
    天已经明了，她又看见伤员那只冻得又黑又肿的光脚板，回到家里去找棉花，没找见，就撕了闺女的一个袄襟，给伤员包住了脚，又侍候伤员吃了三碗糊糊，这回伤员已经能自己端着碗吃了。后来，担架来了，她给厚厚的铺上谷草，直等伤员平安的躺下去，她还再三再四叮嘱民兵小心照料他。民兵们把担架上了肩，只听见伤员在说：“好老人啦！好老人啦！我什么时候也忘不了你的好处呵！”
    戎冠秀不但疼爱子弟兵，她自己的第三个儿子蓝金，就是我们勇敢的子弟兵当中的一个。蓝金同志现在是第一野战军的一个战斗员，在去年春天的一个战斗中，他光荣的立了功。立功的喜报从遥远的前线来到家乡，村里的人都称赞说：“真是老的英雄儿好汉。”全家欢腾异常。特别是蓝金的媳妇喜花，更比别人喜欢三分。
    说起蓝金的媳妇喜花，本是戎冠秀自小抱大的。戎冠秀待喜花，就像待亲闺女一样。蓝金到前线去，戎冠秀对喜花说：“粗布衣裳窝窝菜饭，以后的日子，宁叫我们困难，不叫你困难。”蓝金要是有一个长时间没有信回家，戎冠秀就要对喜花说：“长久不回来，该走还是走，你走了，还是我的闺女。”每逢戎冠秀说这些话，喜花常常不回答。有一次，戎冠秀给蓝金写信，她问喜花要写啥，喜花低着头，仍旧不说话。戎冠秀说：“写上一句你的媳妇没有忘记你。”喜花不回答，戎冠秀说：“不说话，就是同意。”事实就是这样，喜花后来偷偷写了个纸条装在信封里。纸条上有两句话是这样说的：“咱娘怕我坚持不了，我总要等你回来。”
    我问戎冠秀，想不想蓝金回来？戎冠秀说：“为啥不想？”她停一停，沉重的说：“但是，只要敌人还没有完全消灭，蓝金就要革命到底，不能回来。”
    这就是中国的母亲们要说的话。在西北高原的蓝金同志和守卫着祖国边疆的兄弟姊妹们，应该牢牢记住母亲的这句话，提高警惕，响应我们光荣母亲永远战斗的号召！（附图片）
