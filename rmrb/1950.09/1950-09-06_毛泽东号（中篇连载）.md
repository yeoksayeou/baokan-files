　　Eighteen. Ideological Problems

　　After the argument, Shang Baoheng outwardly criticized Zheng Dugong for not cursing, but secretly cheered him on.

　　Zheng Dugong's old problem became more and more serious!

　　Old Shang kept a tight rein on him. As long as he gave a behind-the-scenes instruction, he would confront the old hero. Even without reason, he would stir things up. The old hero couldn't say a word without being attacked.

　　But the old hero didn't slack off in his work.

　　Others, fearing that he would seize upon their shortcomings to criticize them, also secretly worked hard.

　　Old Shang wanted to compete with him even more, and said to Zheng Dugong behind his back:

　　"He can't keep us behind in work, and he wouldn't dare eat us. If he doesn't let us feel good, he won't have peace either!"

　　Old Saint said:

　　"Why don't we just squeeze him off the train!"

　　But Old Shang disagreed:

　　"Why do you say that?"

　　Old Saint said:

　　"I hate the way he's always pointing fingers and not letting people relax. If he's on the train, I have to get off."

　　"That's where I'm different from you," Old Shang said. He didn't continue, considering whether to tell Zheng Dugong about this thought.

　　Old Shang's idea was this: Even though the old hero isn't good, it's good to have him on the train to make trouble. It's no problem to tell a tall tale or slack off because the old hero has his own problems and can't accuse others of being dirty. If a Communist Party member comes to be the driver chief, it will be even stricter and more troublesome.

　　Actually, Old Shang was also straightforward. When Old Zheng pressed him, he told him everything, and finally said:

　　"You kid are really a rascal. Do you want to go to another train and be managed by the Party members?!"

　　Old Saint sniffled repeatedly and stuck out his tongue:

　　"No, no, no, I didn't mean it that way!..."

　　In the blink of an eye, it was spring of 1948, and the three-shift system was restored. Sun Xiaobo was transferred to the Railway Engineering Corps, and several new people came.

　　Old Shang and Old Zheng still opposed the old hero every day, and the old hero's temper became more and more impatient, and his attitude was often bad. As time passed, the new people were also controlled by Old Shang. Old Shang became the "king" on the train, and his word was law. The old hero didn't even dare to speak, and didn't dare to report to the leadership, fearing that the leadership would look down on him.

　　The leadership didn't pay attention to this problem in time, and the old hero couldn't get over it in his mind for a while, and was just sad all day long. When he got home, he couldn't eat or sleep. His wife wanted to ask his youngest daughter, Yunxiang, to go to the section to ask for leave for him to rest for a few days, but he said he couldn't rest, sighing and making the whole family uneasy.

　　When he got on the train, he felt even more uncomfortable. For a year, he had put in effort, sold his strength, sweated, broken his arm, and won awards on the "Mao Zedong Hao." He was reluctant to leave this train, but he really couldn't stay any longer, so he had to go to the section chief to request to get off the train.

    十八  思想问题
    吵架回去，商宝恒表面上批评郑笃恭不该骂人，暗地里却对他叫好。
    郑笃恭的老毛病就越来越厉害了！
    老商把他拉得紧紧的，只要在背后一指使，他就对老英雄顶上去，没理也搅三分，老英雄除非别说话，一张嘴就挨碰。
    但是老英雄在工作上不松劲。
    别人怕他抓住把柄挑眼，也都暗里使劲干。
    老商更要和他比个高低，背后和郑笃恭说：
    “工作上落不了后，他也不敢把咱吃了，他不叫咱痛快，他也安生不了！”
    老圣人说：
    “干脆把他挤下车去算了！”
    可是老商不同意：
    “你怎么这样说？”
    老圣人道：
    “我嫌他东指西拨的不让人闲着；他要在车上，我得下去。”
    “这我就和你不一样，”老商说。他没有再说下去，他在考虑，要不要把这个思想告诉郑笃恭。
    老商的思想是这样：别看老英雄不好，他在车上还是好闹，讲个怪话偷个懒没问题，老英雄自己屁股上有屎不能说别人脏。要是换个共产党员来当司机长，那就更严格更麻烦了。
    其实老商也是直性子，等到老郑一追问，他也就把这思想全盘说了出来，末了说：
    “你这小子真是混球儿一个，你想到别的车上叫党员们把你管起来呀？！”
    老圣人接连吸溜着鼻子，吐了吐舌头：
    “不不不，这么说我可不啦！……”
    转眼到了一九四八年春天，恢复了三班制。孙效伯调到铁道兵团，又新来了几个人。
    老商、老郑还是成天反对老英雄，老英雄的性情也越来越急躁，常常态度不好。日子一长，新来的人也被老商掌握了。老商成了车上的“王”，说一不二。老英雄连话也不敢说，也不敢向领导上反映，怕领导上看不起他。
    领导上也没有及时注意这问题，老英雄思想一时又拐不过湾，只是成天伤心。回到家里饭也吃不下，觉也睡不好。老伴要叫小女儿云香到段上给他请假歇几天，他又说歇不住，唉声叹气，闹的全家不安。
    一到车上心里就更难受：一年来，他在“毛泽东号”费过心机，卖过力气，流过汗，摔坏过胳膊，得过奖，对这台车是舍不得离开，可是又实在不能再待下去，只好找段长去请求下车。
