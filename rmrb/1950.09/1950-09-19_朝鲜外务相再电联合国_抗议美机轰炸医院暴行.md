    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th -- Pak Hon-yong, Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a cable to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the Security Council on the 16th, once again protesting the US aircraft's violation of international law and the brutal bombing of hospitals. The cable stated: "During the barbaric bombing of Pyongyang by US aircraft on September 16, the Pyongyang Central Hospital area was targeted. The hospital's roof and surrounding courtyards were marked with prominent Red Cross symbols, yet US aircraft dropped 172 bombs on the hospital. Ten of these bombs hit, killing eleven people, injuring forty-one, and destroying one building. Other buildings were also damaged. In the name of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I once again strongly protest the US aircraft's continued intentional bombing of medical facilities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, its blatant violation of the Geneva Conventions and generally accepted international laws, and request that you convey the above incident to all member states of the United Nations and members of the Security Council, and take prompt measures to stop such crimes by the American aggressors in Korea. Please inform us of the measures taken regarding this matter."

    抗议美机轰炸医院暴行
    【新华社平壤十八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永，于十六日致电联合国秘书长与安全理事会主席，再度抗议美机违反国际法，残暴地轰炸医院的罪行。电文称：“九月十六日美机野蛮地轰炸平壤时，将平壤中央医院地区当作轰炸的目标之一。医院的屋顶上和医院附近的院落均挂有鲜明的红十字标帜，但美机竟对医院投弹一百七十二颗。其中有十颗命中，炸死十一人，炸伤四十一人，破坏建筑物一幢，其他建筑物亦均遭到损失。我以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的名义，再度坚决抗议美机继续有意地轰炸朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的医疗设施，横暴地违反日内瓦公约和一般公认的国际法规的行为，并要求阁下将上述事件传达给联合国全体会员国和安理会理事国，迅速采取措施，制止美国侵略者在朝鲜的这种罪行。请告知对此项问题通过的办法。”
