Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 13th—War criminal Chen Lifu, in Paris, directed special agents and thugs to destroy the General Association of Chinese Students in France on the 10th. Furniture and belongings were completely wrecked. Chen arrived in France several weeks ago with a large amount of US dollars, bribing shameless thugs, intending to persecute upright and patriotic overseas Chinese in France. Our patriotic students in France then issued a declaration last week, calling on righteous Chinese and French people to jointly eliminate this heinous war criminal. Chen then ordered his henchmen, Chen Chuben, Gong Shuying, and others to break into the student association and commit violence. After the student association secretary, Chen Shiyi, and others reported to the police, several assailants have been arrested. After this incident occurred, there was a public outcry in Paris, and all believe that the French government should not condone or tolerate this.
