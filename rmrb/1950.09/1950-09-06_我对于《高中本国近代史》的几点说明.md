Regarding my "High School Modern Chinese History" (Volume 1), Mr. Chen Changbo has made some serious criticisms and pointed out some errors. In addition to expressing my gratitude and acknowledging my mistakes, I originally didn't need to say anything more. However, the errors in this textbook are not limited to the points pointed out by Mr. Chen. I must take this opportunity to examine myself. Secondly, I feel that Mr. Chen has gone a little too far in some places, and I am willing to frankly raise them to ask Mr. Chen for advice.

First of all, I want to explain that this textbook was divided from my "A Century of Modern Chinese History" (not "simplified"). I started writing "A Century of Modern Chinese History" in the summer of 1946. At that time, I was in Guilin and couldn't find any reference books. I only found Mr. Li Jianong's "Thirty Years of Chinese Political History" and Mr. Hua Gang's "Modern Chinese History" and started writing. This kind of work attitude is wrong. This is called a "careless style," which is most undesirable.

When I started writing, it was at a time when the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang were on the rise, so many things were said in response to the political situation at that time. For example, when describing the so-called "preparation for constitutionalism" by the Manchu Qing government, I said that it used "dragging" and "deceiving" methods, because at that time Chiang Kai-shek was using "dragging" and "deceiving" methods to undermine the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Also, when criticizing Li Hongzhang's handling of foreign affairs and the Reform Movement of 1898, I used the words "bad government," because at that time American imperialism said that Chiang Kai-shek's government was a "bad government." This kind of writing that uses the past to satirize the present is entirely my consistent style of writing "Essays." It is certainly inappropriate to write history books in the style of writing essays.

"A Century of Modern Chinese History" was not successfully written in Guilin, so I went to Hong Kong. I continued to write in Hong Kong. At that time, I had reference books and collected a lot of materials, so when I finished writing, it turned out to be 400,000 words (now the part divided out as a textbook is only about 120,000 words, less than one-third of the whole book). I sold the copyright to Xinzhi Bookstore in the summer of 1948. In order to make the book consistent in detail and brevity, I should have rewritten the first part, but I didn't do so. Or I could have deleted the first part and only started writing from the Great Revolution of 1925 to 1927, but I didn't do so because the book was titled "A Century of Modern Chinese History."

Last year I arrived in Beijing. At that time, middle schools were experiencing a textbook shortage. The old ones were no longer suitable, and new ones had not been compiled. Some people thought that the first part of my "A Century of Modern Chinese History" could be rearranged into "High School Modern Chinese History" and asked for my consent. I thought that there might be errors in the narrative, which needed to be greatly revised, but I had other urgent work to complete and couldn't spare the time, so others helped me revise it as much as possible, and it was printed as "High School Modern Chinese History," and it was recommended by the Textbook Compilation and Review Committee of the Education Department of the North China People's Government, which considered it "more suitable for teaching." Now that I think about it, I made another mistake; since I knew that "there might be errors in the narrative," I should have insisted on not changing it to "High School Modern Chinese History"; since I couldn't insist, I should have taken some time to seriously revise it, or thoroughly adapt it.

Now, I am very grateful to Mr. Chen Changbo for pointing out the serious errors in it one by one, and publishing them in "Book Review", so that teachers using this textbook can correct them one by one according to Mr. Chen's instructions. There are some other errors that Mr. Chen did not point out, and I should take this opportunity to supplement them:

(1) Page 33, "In 1836, Hong Xiuquan and Feng Yunshan set up a secret organization in Penghua Mountain, between Guiping and Wuxuan counties in Guangxi." 1836 should be 1847.

(2) Page 45, "In the autumn of 1854, the Xiang Army occupied Yuezhou and captured Wuchang, completing its first phase of operations." According to records, the Taiping Army recaptured Wuchang in April 1855, and it was not lost until the winter of 1856, so the Xiang Army's first phase of operations should be said to have been completed in 1856, not 1854.

(3) Page 49, "Generally, after Zheng Chenggong's failure to resist the Ming," "resist the Ming" should be "resist the Qing."

(4) Page 52, "He also ordered Yuan Jiasan (Yuan Shikai's father) to exclusively suppress the Nian rebels in the three provinces of Zhili, Shandong, and Anhui." "Yuan Shikai's father" should be "Yuan Shikai's clan uncle."

(5) Page 65, "French troops attacked Taiwan and Fuzhou, destroying the Road Administration Bureau and the Mawei Forts," "Road Administration Bureau" should be "Ship Administration Bureau."

(6) Page 67, "The Siamese government had no choice but to cede the area east of the Mekong River and several small islands at the mouth of the river to France in 1893." "And several small islands at the mouth of the river" should be deleted.

(7) Page 69, "Japan and Korea signed a treaty in Liverpool," "Liverpool" should be "Chemulpo."

(8) Page 73, "Therefore, geography is useless, and people are completely lost," "geography" should be "geographical advantage."

In addition, there may be errors due to the author's slip of the pen (such as mistakenly writing "passed away" as "passed away"), or due to careless typesetting and proofreading, there must be many typos. Mr. Chen Changbo said that I was "lazy" and that I "rushed to write the book," which I fully admit.

There are a few places where I feel that Mr. Chen has gone a little too far. For example, he said, "This textbook can really be said to be a not-so-brilliant abridged version of Li Jianong's Thirty Years of Chinese Political History," and also said, "If you want to give examples, you have to copy the entire book." It seems that I completely copied Li Jianong's book, only to delete and abridge it. Fortunately, Li Jianong's "Thirty Years of Chinese Political History" is still available, and as long as you compare Li's book with my "High School Modern Chinese History," you can see that it is not necessarily the case, so I won't explain much here. For example, he said, "Page 44 says that in the early days of the revolution, the powers adopted a neutral attitude, 'but the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom lacked diplomatic talent.' It seems that as long as there is diplomatic talent, the invaders would not help the Manchu Qing." This is Mr. Chen taking things out of context. My original text is: "But the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom lacked diplomatic talent, and also failed to understand the principles of capitalist aggression, and to determine a diplomatic policy; and the powers also felt that the victory of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom would undermine the privileges they enjoyed in China, so they used force to oppress the Manchu Qing government, first forcing the Manchu Qing government to submit, and then helping it to eliminate the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Now Mr. Chen does not quote the entire sentence of my original text, but only extracts the eleven words "but the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom lacked diplomatic talent" to criticize, which cannot make me "admire him."

　　我对于《高中本国近代史》的几点说明
    宋云彬
    陈昌勃先生对于我编的那本《高中本国近代史》（上册）加以严正的批评，并且指出了若干错误，我除了表示感激和承认自己的错误之外，原不必再说什么话。不过这个课本的错误还不止陈先生指出的几点，我得趁机会自己来检讨一下；其次，我觉得有些地方陈先生也说得太过分了一点，愿意很坦白地提出来向陈先生请教。
    首先我要说明这个课本是从我编的《中国近百年史》里分割出来的（并非“简编而成”）。我动手编《中国近百年史》在一九四六年夏天。那时候我在桂林，找不到什么参考书，只找到了李剑农先生的《最近三十年中国政治史》和华岗先生的《中国近代史》，就开始写了。这种工作态度是不对的。这就叫做“粗枝大叶的作风”，是最要不得的。
    开始编写的时候，正值国民党反动势力高涨，所以有许多话是针对当时的政治情况说的。例如叙述满清政府的所谓“预备立宪”，就说它是用“拖”和“骗”的手段，那是因为那时候蒋介石正用“拖”和“骗”的手段来破坏政协决议。又如批评李鸿章办洋务和戊戌维新运动，都用了“坏政府”的字样，那是因为那时候美帝国主义说蒋介石政府是一个“坏政府”。这种借古讽今的写法完全是我过去写《杂文》的一贯作风。用写杂文的笔调来写历史书，当然是不相宜的。
    《中国近百年史》在桂林没有写成功，我就到香港去了。在香港继续写。那时候参考书有了，材料也搜集得多了，所以脱稿的时候一结算，竟有四十万字（现在分割出来作为课本的一部分只有十二万字左右，不及全书的三分之一）。把版权卖给新知书店，那是一九四八年夏天的事情。要使全书前后详略相称，我应该把前面一部分重新写过，但是我没有这样做。或者把前面一部分删去，只从一九二五到二七年大革命写起，但是为了书名是《近百年史》的缘故，也没有这样做。
    去年我到了北京。那时候中学校正闹着教科书荒，旧的不适用了，新的没有编出来。有人认为我写的《中国近百年史》的前面的一部分可以改排成为《高中本国近代史》，征求我同意。我认为里面叙述恐有错误的地方，须大加修改，但是我手头有旁的工作急待完成，抽不出时间，就由别人替我尽可能地修改了一下，作为《高中本国近代史》印出来了，并且经华北人民政府教育部教科书编审委员会的推荐，认为“较适于教学”。现在想起来，我又犯了错误；既然自己知道“里面叙述恐有错误的地方”，就应当坚持不把它改为《高中本国近代史》；既然不能坚持，就应该抽出些时间来把它认真修改，或者彻底改编。
    现在承陈昌勃先生把里面的严重的错误一一指出来，并且在《图书评论》上发表，可以让采用这个课本的教师依照陈先生所指出的一一加以改正，我十二分感谢陈先生。还有一些错误的地方陈先生没有指出来，我应该趁此机会补充一下：
    （一）三三页“一八三六年洪秀全冯云山在广西桂平武宣两县中间的鹏化山设立秘密机关。”一八三六年应作一八四七年。
    （二）四五页“一八五四年秋，湘军攻占岳州，进陷武昌，完成其第一部作战计划。”查一八五五年四月间太平军又夺回武昌，直到一八五六年冬天才失守，所以湘军完成其第一步作战计划应该说是一八五六年，不是一八五四年。
    （三）四十九页“大抵自郑成功抗明失败以后”，“抗明”应作“抗清”。
    （四）五二页“又命袁甲三（袁世凯的父亲）专剿直鲁皖三省捻子”。“袁世凯的父亲”应作“袁世凯的族祖”。
    （五）六五页“法军攻台湾福州，毁路政局及马尾炮台”，“路政局”应作“船政局”。
    （六）六七页“暹逻政府不得已，于一八九三年把湄公河以东地方及河口的几个小岛割让给法国。”“及河口的几个小岛”应删去。
    （七）六九页“日韩在利物浦订约”，“利物浦”应作“济物浦”。
    （八）七三页“因此地理无用，人和尽失”，“地理”应作“地利”。
    此外或出于作者笔误（如“与世长辞”）误写为“与世长逝”之类），或由于排校疏忽，错字一定还不少。陈昌勃先生说我“偷懒”，说我“匆促成书”，我是完全承认的。
    有几处地方我觉得陈先生是说得过分了一点的。例如他说“这本课本实在可说是李剑农最近三十年中国政治史的不高明的节本”，又说“如果要举例，势非抄完全书不可”。好像我完全抄袭了李剑农的书，只不过加以删节而已。好在李剑农的《最近三十年中国政治史》现在还买得到，只要把李书跟我编的《高中本国近代史》对照一下，就可以知道未必尽然，在这里不多解释。又如说，“四四页说革命初期，列强采取中立态度，‘但太平天国缺乏外交人才’。仿佛只要有外交人才，侵略者不会给满清帮凶似的。”这是陈先生在断章取义。我的原文是：“但太平天国缺乏外交人才，又不能了解资本主义侵略的道理，确定外交方针；而列强也觉得太平天国的胜利会破坏他们在中国所享有的特权，就用武力压迫满清政府，先使满清政府就范，然后再帮助它来消灭太平天国。”现在陈先生不引我原文的全句，只摘出“但太平天国缺乏外交人才”这么十一个字来批评一下，是不能使我“心折”的。
