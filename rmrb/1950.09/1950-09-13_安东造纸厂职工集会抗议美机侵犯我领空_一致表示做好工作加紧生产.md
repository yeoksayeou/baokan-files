　　Anshan Paper Mill Workers Rally to Protest U.S. Aircraft Intrusion into Our Airspace
    Unanimously Pledge to Do Their Jobs Well and Step Up Production

    [Reported by this newspaper] All workers of the Anshan Paper Mill gathered at 4:00 PM on the 5th to protest the U.S. aircraft's intrusion into our airspace and the brutal massacre of our people. The meeting was conducted in an atmosphere of grief and anger. Comrade Li Renpan, chairman of the meeting, first indignantly described the bloody facts of the U.S. imperialist aircraft's illegal border crossing and the killing and wounding of many of our compatriots. He emphatically pointed out, "This bloody lesson fully exposes the ugly face of imperialism. We must take practical actions to smash the U.S. imperialists' beastly provocations, support Foreign Minister Zhou's two statements, demand blood for blood, and avenge our dead compatriots." Nie Zhongyi, the "New Record Movement Locomotive," said, "Blood debts must be paid in blood. We must turn anger into strength. I work in the digester, and I will raise the rate of first-class products to 90%, pay attention to the cost of the workshop, and not let a single screw or a piece of chalk be wasted, in order to reduce the cost of products." Old worker Liu Zhensheng, who consistently did not speak at meetings, stood up excitedly today and said, "It really makes me hate them! I haven't been to school, and I haven't spoken in front of people, and I can't express myself, but I know what's in my heart. We must not be intimidated by the paper tiger. I will step up my work and improve the quantity and quality of production to deal with these beasts of imperialism." Cao Guangrui, head of the technology section, also indignantly stated: All technical personnel will resolutely stick to their posts, work diligently, conduct accurate tests and analyses, and sign technical assistance contracts with veteran workers. The accounting section stated that it would prepare for workshop cost management, and the wage section stated that it would improve piecework wages. The production workshop will improve quality and reduce costs. Representatives from nine sections and thirteen workshops successively expressed their attitudes and read out the joint protest letters of their units.

　　安东造纸厂职工集会抗议美机侵犯我领空
    一致表示做好工作加紧生产
    【本报讯】安东造纸厂全体职工于五日下午四时集会抗议美机侵犯我国领空，残杀我国人民暴行。大会是在沉痛愤怒的气氛中进行的。大会主席李仁泮同志首先愤激地叙述美帝国主义飞机非法越境并杀伤我同胞多名的血腥事实。并着重指出“这一血的教训充分暴露了帝国主义的嘴脸，我们要以实际行动来粉碎美帝国主义的兽性挑衅，拥护周外长的两次声明，讨还血债，为死难同胞复仇”。“新纪录运动火车头”聂忠义说：“血债要用血来偿，我们要把愤怒变成力量。我在木釜工作，要把一等品提高到百分之九十，关心车间的成本，那怕一个螺丝钉、一个粉笔头，也不能让它浪费，以减低产品的成本”。开会时一贯不发言的老工友刘振声同志今天激动的起来说：“真把我恨坏了，我没念过书，也没在人前说过话，咱有话说不出，但是我心里可有数，决不能叫纸老虎吓倒了。我要加紧工作，提高产量质量，来对付帝国主义这帮野兽。”技术科长曹光锐同志也激愤的表示：全体技术人员决坚守岗位，安心工作、准确化验分析，与老工人订好技术互助合同。会计科表示作好车间成本管理准备工作，工薪科表示搞好计件工资，生产车间以提高质量，减低成本。机修车间表示及时修理，不误生产。九个科、十三个车间代表相继都表示了态度，宣读了自己单位的联名抗议书。
