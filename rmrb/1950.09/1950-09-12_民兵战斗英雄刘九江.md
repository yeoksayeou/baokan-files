　　Militia Combat Hero Liu Jiujiang
    Li Zhenhua
    Liu Jiujiang, a militia combat hero and production model from Chahar Province, is from Daoba Village, Lingqiu County, Chahar Province. He came from a peasant background and joined the Communist Party in the winter of 1937.

    In 1938, the Japanese invaders occupied Lingqiu County. The Party gave him the task of organizing the militia to fight against the enemy. He conducted propaganda among the masses, organized seven outstanding youths as the backbone of the militia, organized self-defense teams to stand guard, and captured traitors. In 1939, the militia grew to fourteen people. At that time, the enemy was constantly mobilized, and they had nothing but a few grenades. So they came up with a way to fill iron teapots with explosives and make landmines, which blocked the enemy and showed great power. In 1941, the Eighth Route Army was stationed in his village. Seeing that they had no weapons, they gave them twelve rifles and more than four hundred bullets. After mastering the weapons, they reorganized the militia organization and divided the militia into reconnaissance, blasting, and shooting groups. In order to facilitate education and training, they slept together at night, worked during the day, and studied blasting, shooting, guerrilla warfare, and joint defense during rest.

    In October 1941, the Japanese invaders departed from Lingqiu to "mop up" Fuping. Liu Jiujiang organized the masses to transfer, clear the fields, cover the anti-Japanese cadres, and lead the militia to block the enemy. Unfortunately, he was captured by the enemy. Under the enemy's severe torture, he remained unyielding, demonstrating the noble qualities of a Communist Party member. After escaping from danger, he recovered from his injuries and continued to fight bravely. In the cold winter, he led the militia deep into the enemy's strongholds, using iron teapot landmines to destroy an enemy car. In December, he cooperated with the militia in neighboring villages to destroy the Weicun government office in Shangzhai and captured two traitors. In October 1944, the enemy launched a surprise attack on Shangzhai Village. Liu Jiujiang led the militia to set off overnight and rushed to Yanchibu to lay a minefield, using rifles to lure the enemy into the minefield, killing two enemies, and finally delaying the enemy's advance. When the enemy raided Dagao Village, nine cadres were captured. Liu Jiujiang immediately led the militia to cooperate with the troops in ambushing the enemy on the side of Daoba Mountain, rescuing them. In the autumn of the same year, when cooperating with the militia in the entire district to seize the enemy's military grain at the Mentou stronghold, he led a squad to serve as a guard, covering the masses to load the grain, but was surrounded by the enemy. He bravely rushed towards the enemy, covering the safe transfer of the masses and the militia.

    Comrade Liu Jiujiang led the militia in combat during the War of Resistance Against Japan, achieving great results. In 1944, he was named a combat hero of Lingqiu County and attended the Yingmo Conference in Yanbei Prefecture.

    After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a civil war. In the winter of 1945, Comrade Liu Jiujiang voluntarily requested to go on an expedition, leading a militia platoon to climb down to the city of Shanyin at night, carry explosives, and destroy the city wall. In the autumn of 1947, the enemy often came out to harass and grab food. He led the militia platoon deep into Guanglingchuan to protect the autumn harvest in the border areas.

    In the spring of 1948, during the battle to liberate Tianzhen in the Chahar-Suiyuan Campaign, he led a stretcher company to rescue the wounded fearlessly under heavy fire. He took meticulous care of the wounded. When the wounded could not move on the stretcher, he used his own rice bowl to collect the wounded's urine. When he led the stretcher company on an expedition during the Pingjin Campaign, he was extremely concerned about the team members, personally fetching water and food for them, and asking them about their well-being. After successfully completing the task, he was praised by the County Armed Forces Committee and awarded the honorary title of "Support-the-Front Model".

    Liu Jiujiang is a hero who is both "labor" and "military" capable. Their work exchange mutual aid group has persisted from 1941 to the present. After the war in North China ended, he actively led the production of the entire village, organized work exchange mutual aid, and cultivated the land deeply and carefully. Last June, the village suffered a flood, washing away more than 120 acres of land, and seven households suffered complete disasters. At that time, Liu Jiujiang conducted explanatory education among the masses, mobilizing them to work hard in production to overcome the disaster. After the autumn harvest, he calculated the village's grain, which was only enough to eat until the end of the year. So, according to the village's population, labor force, and technology, he organized twenty-eight young and middle-aged people to go to Kouquan to carry coal, and six carpenters went to other villages to work. He also led the remaining fifty-six people in the village to chop 510,000 catties of firewood and organized women to make shoes. This summer, he organized a part of the labor force to go out to do odd jobs, and a part stayed at home to produce work exchange mutual aid. After his careful planning, they finally survived the disaster. Therefore, in January of this year, Daoba Village was rated as a model village for production and disaster relief. In August, he was also awarded a "Production Medal" by the Provincial People's Government.

　　民兵战斗英雄刘九江
    李振华
    察哈尔省民兵战斗英雄、生产模范刘九江，是察省灵邱县道八村人，农民出身，一九三七年冬天参加共产党。
    一九三八年，日寇占领灵邱县城，党给了他组织民兵进行对敌斗争的任务。他就在群众中进行宣传，组织了七个优秀青年为民兵骨干，组织自卫队站岗放哨，捉拿汉奸。一九三九年，民兵发展到十四人。当时敌人不断出动，他们除了几个手榴弹，没有别的武器。于是他们想出了办法，用铁壶装上炸药，作成地雷，封锁敌人，显示了很大威力。一九四一年，八路军驻到他村，见他们没有武器，便送给他们十二支步枪、四百余发子弹。他们掌握了武器以后，又重新整顿了民兵组织，把民兵分成侦察、爆炸、射击三个小组。为便于教育训练，晚上集中睡觉，白天拨工生产，休息时学习爆破、射击、打扭击战、联防战。
    一九四一年十月，日寇从灵邱出发，“扫荡”阜平。刘九江组织群众转移，坚壁清野，掩护抗日干部，带领民兵阻击敌人。不幸被敌人捕去。在敌人的严刑拷打下，他宁死不屈，表现了共产党员的高贵品质。脱险后，他养好了伤，又继续英勇地战斗。在严寒的冬天，他带领民兵深入敌据点活动，用铁壶地雷炸毁敌人汽车一辆。十二月又配合邻村民兵摧毁了上寨伪村公所，捕捉了两个汉奸。一九四四年十月，敌人奔袭上寨村，刘九江带领民兵连夜出发，赶到雁翅布上地雷阵，用步枪诱敌进入雷区，毙敌二名，终于迟滞了敌人的前进。当敌人奔袭大高石村时，有九个干部被俘，刘九江即带领民兵配合部队在道八山侧击敌人，救出了他们。同年秋天，配合全区民兵在门头据点夺取敌人的军粮时，他带领一个班担任警戒，掩护群众装粮，不料被敌包围。他奋不顾身，向敌冲击，掩护了群众和民兵的安全转移。
    刘九江同志在抗日战争中，带领民兵作战，成绩很大。一九四四年他被评为灵邱县战斗英雄，出席了雁北专区英模大会。
    日寇投降后，国民党反动派又发动了内战。一九四五年冬，刘九江同志自动要求出征，带领一个民兵排，夜间爬到山阴城下，抱上炸药，将城墙炸毁。一九四七年秋，敌人经常出扰抢粮，他带领民兵排深入广灵川下活动，保卫了边沿区的秋收。
    一九四八年春天，在察绥战役解放天镇战斗中，他带领担架连，在猛烈的火力下，奋不顾身抢救伤员。他对伤员的照顾无微不至，伤员在担架上不能动弹，他用自己的饭碗给伤员接尿。平津战役中，他带领担架连出征时，对队员异常关心，亲自给打水打饭，并向他们问寒问暖。胜利完成了任务后，他受到县武委会的表扬，并奖给“支前模范”的荣誉称号。
    刘九江是一个“劳”“武”双全的英雄。他们的拨工互助组，从一九四一年一直坚持到现在。华北地区战争结束后，他积极领导全村生产，组织拨工互助，深耕细作。去年六月，村中遭受水灾，被冲地一百二十余亩，有七户土地全部受灾。当时，刘九江在群众中进行了解释教育，动员努力生产战胜灾荒。秋收以后，他把全村的粮食计算了一下，只够吃到年底。于是，他根据全村人口、劳动力和技术，组织了二十八个青壮年去口泉背煤，六个木匠则到外村做工，并领导留在本村的五十六人，打柴五十一万斤，还组织妇女做鞋。今年夏天又组织一部分劳动力出外打短工，一部分留在家里生产拨工互助。经过他精心计划，终于度过了灾荒。因此，今年一月，道八村被评为生产度荒模范村。八月，他又荣获省人民政府“生产奖章”一枚。
