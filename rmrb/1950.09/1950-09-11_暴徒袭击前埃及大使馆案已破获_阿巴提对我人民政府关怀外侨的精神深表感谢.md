Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th—The Nanjing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau has solved the robbery case of the former Egyptian Embassy in Nanjing by a mob. The principal offenders Zhang Mingshan, Gao Xiachang, Zhang Mingliang, etc., have been arrested, and the remaining criminals are at large and are being pursued.
　　The former Egyptian Embassy in Nanjing was attacked by a mob on September 3. After Chargé d'Affaires Abbadi was injured by the mob, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched a team to the scene for investigation. Given that the mob knew the steward's surname was Chen and where the maid lived, and also knew Abbadi's living habits, namely that he had to receive a phone call from his home country before coming downstairs in the evening, and after Abbadi estimated that it might be retaliation by the dismissed cook Zhang Mingshan, the bureau sought out Wu Qiwu, who was dismissed by the former Egyptian Embassy last March, for investigation. According to Wu, "Several days before the robbery, I saw a tall man wandering in front of the embassy five times." After further investigation, the Public Security Bureau found that the tall man was named Gao Xiachang, who usually engaged in illegal activities and had extorted money from people under the guise of the criminal police team before liberation. Based on this, the Public Security Bureau arrested Gao. After interrogation, Gao confessed that Zhang Mingshan and Zhang Mingliang were plotting revenge, and said that Zhang Mingliang had a scar on his face. Subsequently, the two criminals Zhang Mingshan and Zhang Mingliang were arrested at the same time. After inspection, it was confirmed that Zhang Mingliang had finger scars on his face, and a pair of sneakers with many blood stains were found in his home, thus confirming Zhang Mingliang's major involvement in the case.
　　After repeated interrogation by the Public Security Bureau, the criminals confessed everything. According to the principal offender Zhang Mingliang, the case is as follows: The mastermind was Zhang Mingshan, who was a cook at the former Egyptian Embassy several months ago, and was later dismissed for drunkenness and negligence. Zhang Mingshan held a grudge because of this, and discussed a revenge plan with the gangster Gao Xiachang, saying that Abbadi's residence had hundreds of taels of gold and a lot of U.S. dollars. At that time, Gao's brother-in-law Zhang Mingliang was also present, and also wanted to take the opportunity to make a fortune, so he discussed the matter with a gangster named Gao Zhiying. The criminals gathered at Gao Xiachang's home to plan the robbery, and Gao Zhiying invited habitual offenders Deng Qiyou and Yu Liangde to participate, and Gao also contacted Chen Qiyou from Jurong County near Nanjing to bring a homemade pistol. At this point, the conspiracy was completed. Finally, it was decided that Deng Qiyou and Zhang Mingshan would first scout the road, and Deng Qiyou, Yu Liangde, and Zhang Mingliang would jump over the wall to carry out the robbery. On the evening of September 3, Deng Qiyou took a knife, Zhang Mingliang held Chen Qiyou's pistol, and Yu Liangde took a rope and went to Abbadi's residence to carry out the robbery. When Abbadi woke up, the criminals fled because the pistol did not fire. When Abbadi chased downstairs, the three criminals fought with Abbadi downstairs and stabbed him.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th—After the former Egyptian Chargé d'Affaires Abbadi was robbed and stabbed by bandits, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government attached great importance to the matter. In addition to ordering the People's Public Security Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation, Abbadi was immediately sent to Gulou Hospital for emergency treatment. The Nanjing Municipal People's Government sent Zhang Linsheng, the chief of the Foreign Affairs Management Section of the Public Security Bureau, to express condolences one day after the incident (September 4). On the morning of the 10th, Ke Qingshi, the mayor of Nanjing, personally went to Gulou Hospital to express his condolences, expressed his great concern for Abbadi's misfortune, and informed him of the progress of the case, comforting him to rest quietly. Abbadi and his wife expressed their deep gratitude to the People's Government for its care for foreign nationals. Abbadi's condition is now improving. According to Dr. Chen, the attending physician, the dangerous period has basically passed.

　　暴徒袭击前埃及大使馆案已破获
    阿巴提对我人民政府关怀外侨的精神深表感谢
    【新华社南京十日电】南京市人民政府公安局已破获南京前埃及驻华大使馆被暴徒抢劫案。主犯张铭山、高遐昌、张名亮等已落网，余犯在逃，现正继续缉获中。
    南京前埃及驻华大使馆于九月三日被暴徒袭击，代办阿巴提被暴徒击伤后，南京市人民政府公安局当即派队前往现场勘查。鉴于暴徒既知管事姓陈和女佣住房，又了解阿巴提生活习惯，即晚上须有本国来电方下楼，复经阿巴提估计可能为解雇厨师张铭山怀恨报复等情，该局乃找去年三月被前埃及使馆解雇之吴其伟调查，据吴谈称：“在劫案发生前几天，曾先后五次看见一个大个子在使馆前徘徊。”公安局经进一步调查结果，该大个子名高遐昌，平时即有不法行为，解放前曾借刑警队名义向人敲诈钱财。据此，公安局当将高逮捕。复经审讯，高即供出张铭山、张名亮力谋复仇等情，并说张名亮脸上有伤痕。嗣将张铭山张名亮两匪同时逮捕。经查验张名亮脸上确有手指伤痕，又从其家中查出球鞋一双，上有很多血迹，遂确定张名亮与此案关系重大。
    经公安局一再审讯，该匪徒等已全部供认不讳。据主犯张名亮供认，该案案情如下：主谋人为张铭山，在数月以前为前埃及大使馆厨师，后因酗酒及过失被解雇。张铭山因此怀恨在心，乃与流氓高遐昌商量复仇计划，并称阿巴提住处有黄金百两，美钞很多。其时，高之内弟张名亮亦在场，也即想乘机发财，遂又与一名叫郜治映的流氓商量此事。该匪等曾聚集在高遐昌家计划行劫，并由郜治映约来惯匪邓其友、于良德两人参与其事，又由郜去南京附近的句容县约得陈其友带来土造手枪一支。至此，密谋遂成。最后决定由邓其友、张铭山二人先去看好道路，由邓其友、于良德、张名亮三人越墙行劫。至九月三日晚，邓其友即带小刀，张名亮持陈其友的手枪，于良德带绳子，一同前往阿巴提住处行劫。当阿巴提惊起时，张匪等因手枪打不响，即往下逃。当阿尾追下楼时，三匪即在楼下与阿巴提对殴，并将阿巴提刺伤。
    【新华社南京十日电】前埃及代办阿巴提被盗匪行劫刺伤后，南京市人民政府重视此事，除责令人民公安局严密侦缉外，当即将阿巴提送往鼓楼医院急救。南京市人民政府于事件发生后一日（九月四日）即派公安局外侨管理科科长张林生前往慰问。十日上午，南京市人民政府柯庆施市长又亲往鼓楼医院慰问，对阿巴提遭此不幸，表示非常关切，并告其破案经过，慰以安静休养。阿巴提夫妇对人民政府如此关怀外侨的精神深表感谢。现阿巴提伤势已趋好转。据主治医生陈大夫谈：危险期已基本度过。
