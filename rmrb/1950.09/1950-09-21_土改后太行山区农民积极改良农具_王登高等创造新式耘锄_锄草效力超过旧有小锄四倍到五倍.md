Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: In the vast rural areas of the Taihang Mountains where land reform has been implemented, farmers have actively begun improving agricultural tools, which has become a mass movement. Beishe Village in Lucheng is one of many rural villages that have launched such a movement.

Beishe Village in Lucheng is a village with a vast land area and a small population. In the past, due to insufficient labor and animal power, farmers could only cultivate the land under a policy of extensive planting and low yields. After land reform, the farmers' livestock and fertilizer have increased significantly, and the land yield has also increased rapidly, but the difficulty of labor during summer weeding has not been overcome. As soon as the corn was weeded, the weeds in the millet fields grew again. A laborer working to the maximum could only weed two mu of land per day, so usually by the time the land was weeded twice, the season had passed.

In recent years, encouraged by the idea of striving for a prosperous life, the farmers of the whole village have demanded the improvement of agricultural tools, and thus the story of "three cobblers being able to top a Zhuge Liang" began. Initially, the old blacksmith Wang Denggao imitated the form of a drill to design a drill hoe, but it failed after testing. Later, the blacksmith added a bottom rod under the drill, so it could be used just barely. This summer, two other farmers named Wang Wenbing and Cheng Daqian found that this tool still needed to be improved during use, so one added a lifting screw on top, and the other added a wheel, thus becoming a new type of tool with an efficiency four to five times greater than the old small hoe used by farmers in the past. Because of its high efficiency, the local farmers named it the "Hong Hoe."

The emergence of this successful new agricultural tool spread like a miracle to far and wide. Farmers from other villages and districts came to visit in an endless stream. The local government also rewarded them. Wang Denggao and the other two inventors became the most glorious people in the whole village.

Beishe Village, which has always lacked labor, has undergone great changes this year due to the emergence of this new type of agricultural tool. In the past, when the whole village used old hoes, the autumn fields could generally only be weeded twice. This year, 108 households in the village manufactured 14 new hoes, and the number of weeding times was generally more than three, and 50% of them even weeded four to five times.

This new type of summer weeding tool, called the "Hong Hoe," is similar in style to the Liberation-style cultivator, and is also moved by animal or human power. According to the results of use in Beishe Village, each frame, if driven by two people and one animal, can weed up to 25 mu per day at its highest efficiency. But because it is easy to move and cheap, farmers in Lucheng and other areas welcome it more than the Liberation-style cultivator.

### 土改后太行山区农民积极改良农具  王登高等创造新式耘锄  锄草效力超过旧有小锄四倍到五倍

　　土改后太行山区农民积极改良农具
    王登高等创造新式耘锄
    锄草效力超过旧有小锄四倍到五倍
    【新华社十七日讯】已经实行了土地改革的太行山区广大农村中，农民积极地起来改良农具，已成为一个群众性的运动。潞城北社村就是展开着这样的运动的许多农村中的一个。
    潞城北社村是一个地广人稀的村庄，过去一向因为劳力和畜力不足，农民只能在广种薄收的政策下耕种土地。土地改革后农民的畜力和肥料都有显著增加，土地产量也提高得很快，但是夏锄中劳力的困难始终没有克服。包谷刚刚锄完，谷子地里的草又长起来了。一个劳动力发挥到顶点每天只能锄二亩地，因此通常锄到两遍，季节便已过去。
    近年以来，全村的农民在争取生活富裕的思想鼓舞下产生了改良农具的要求，于是“三个臭皮匠能顶一个诸葛亮”的故事便从此开始。最初，年老的铁匠王登高模仿耧的形式设计了一种耧锄，但经过试验后失败了。后来，这个铁匠又从耧下加了一个底杆，这样马马虎虎便能用了。今年夏天，另外两个叫王文丙和成大钱的农民，在使用中发现这种工具还有改进必要，于是一个在上面加了升降螺丝，一个加了车轮，这样便成为了一架效率超过过去农民旧有小锄四倍到五倍的新式工具。这种工具因为效率高，当地农民给它起了名字，叫做轰锄。
    这架成功的新式农具一出现，便像一个奇迹似的传遍了远近四方。外村外区的农民来参观的络绎不绝。当地政府也进行了奖励。王登高和其他两个发明人成了全村里最光荣的人物。
    一向劳力缺乏的北社村今年由于这种新式农具的出现，情况发生了很大的变化。过去全村使用旧锄的时候一般秋田只能锄两遍，今年全村一百零八户制造了十四架新锄，普遍锄地次数都在三次以上，其百分之五十甚至锄到了四遍到五遍。
    这种被称为轰锄的新式夏锄工具样式和解放式耘锄相近，也是用畜力或人力拉着行动。现据北社村使用结果，每架如用两个人力、一个牲畜驾驰，最高效率每天可锄二十五亩。但因为它移动轻便和成本便宜，潞城一带农民对它比解放式耘锄更加欢迎。
