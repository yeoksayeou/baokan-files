　　Signature Craze Among Soldiers of the Northern Anhui Military District
    By Our Correspondent Geng Longxiang, Hefei
    [Hefei Dispatch] The peace signature campaign in the units under the Northern Anhui Military District is proceeding very enthusiastically. Soldiers scattered in the Dabie Mountains, along the Yangtze River, and in mining areas and vast rural areas, who are responsible for suppressing bandits and protecting production, are carefully writing their names on the declaration and sending them to the Anhui Northern Branch of the Peace Protection Conference. In July and August alone, the number of signatures has reached more than 47,000. Many soldiers have also attached their photos to the declaration to express their will and determination to defend peace.
    Following the signatures, many units have launched current affairs studies. On wall newspapers and gun-barrel poems, one can see works about defending peace everywhere. Xu Naiqiu of the Communications Team of the Military Region Headquarters wrote in a wall newspaper entitled "Angry Protest": "The people have just escaped from the flames of war and are sorting out their homes to improve their family life, but the American imperialists, who have lost all conscience, want to launch a war and destroy the people's peaceful days. We tell the American imperialists that if you insist on acting recklessly, we will treat you as we treated Japanese imperialism." Sang Jinsheng wrote: "We still have a huge blood debt to settle with the American imperialists. They gave guns and cannons to the Chiang bandits and killed countless people. We have not forgotten this hatred! Now they are personally killing and wounding many of our compatriots and want to provoke a larger war. A life for a life, a debt must be repaid! We must settle both the old and new accounts with them."
    The gun-barrel poem format is even more common, and soldiers love to use weapons to express their feelings. A soldier named Yang Feng wrote:
      The Tommy gun is powerful,
      It killed the Chiang bandits and traitors.
      On the front lines, in the rear,
      Wholeheartedly serving the people.
      The American imperialists want to start a new war
      The people shout "That won't do!"
      I'll sign for Tommy,
      Let's defend peace together.
    These words, woven with love and passion, inspire a firm will and confidence in defending peace. All units are responding to the American imperialists' conspiracy to undermine world peace with active actions such as suppressing the remaining bandits. The soldiers said: "The Kuomintang remnants and secret agents are all running dogs and pawns of the American imperialists. Our suppression of bandits and capture of secret agents is also a blow to the warmongers." In the past two months, the military region troops have captured more than 700 bandits.
    The peace signature campaign is rapidly expanding and being promoted.

　　皖北军区战士的签名热潮
    本报合肥通讯员  耿龙祥
    【合肥通讯】皖北军区所属部队中的和平签名运动，开展得非常热烈。分散在大别山区、长江边上以及矿区和广大农村等地，担任剿清土匪，保护生产等任务的战士们，都非常慎重地把自己的名字写在宣言上，送到保护和平大会皖北分会去。七、八两月，签名人数已达四万七千余人。并有许多战士，把自己的照片贴在宣言上，表示自己保卫和平的志愿和决心。
    随着签名之后，许多单位都展开时事学习。在墙报上，枪杆诗上，到处可看到关于保卫和平的作品。军区司令部通讯队许乃球，在一篇题为《愤怒的抗议》的墙报上写道：“人民刚从炮火里跳出来，正在整理家园，把家庭生活搞好，坏透良心的美帝，又想发动战争，破坏人民的安乐日子。我们告诉美帝，你一定要蛮干，我们只好像对日本帝国主义那样来对你。”桑金胜写道：“我们和美帝还有一大笔血债没算呢，它把枪炮给蒋匪，杀死多少老百姓，这个仇我们没有忘啊！现在又亲自打死打伤我国多少同胞，还想挑起更大的战争。杀人偿命，欠债还钱！新账陈账，总得和它结算一下。”
    用枪杆诗形式的更为普遍，战士们是最喜爱用武器来表达自己感情的。战士杨枫写的一首：
      汤姆式，挺有劲，
      杀过蒋匪卖国贼。
      在前线，在后方，
      一心一意为人民。
      美帝又想发动新战争
      人民高呼“那不行”
      我代汤姆签个名，
      咱俩一道保和平。
    这些用爱和热血交织成的字句，鼓舞着保卫和平的坚定意志和必胜的信心。各单位都以积极清剿残匪等行动，回答美帝破坏世界和平的诡谋。战士们说：国民党残匪和特务，都是美帝的走狗和爪牙，我们剿匪，捉特务，也是对战争贩子的打击。”两月来，军区部队捕捉了残匪七百多人。
    和平签名运动，正在加速地扩大和推广。
