    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社地拉那电引阿尔巴尼亚通讯社消息：南斯拉夫铁托法西斯分子执行美国战争贩子的侵略计划，于八月八日到二十一日间，又在南阿边境向阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国连续进行了六次武装挑衅（按：在此之前，从七月六日到八月七日，南斯拉夫曾在南阿边境进行了六次武装挑衅）。
    八月八日，南斯拉夫飞机两架曾侵入阿尔巴尼亚领空盘旋侦察。在八月十五日至二十一日之间，南斯拉夫士兵曾先后侵入阿尔巴尼亚境内五次，向阿尔巴尼亚巡逻队及边防哨兵开枪射击，射伤阿尔巴尼亚士兵一人。二十一日，南斯拉夫士兵曾在界标间占领阵地，以机枪臼炮向阿尔巴尼亚边防哨兵射击了二十五分钟。挑衅的士兵每次均遭到坚强的还击，然后被迫退却。
