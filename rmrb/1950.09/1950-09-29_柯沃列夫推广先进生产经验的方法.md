　　Kovalev's Method of Promoting Advanced Production Experience
    Lǐ Hé
    Recently, a large-scale and planned movement to promote advanced production methods is unfolding in Soviet industrial enterprises. The initiator of the movement is Engineer Kovalev, director of the "Proletarian Victory" Fine Woolen Cloth Factory in Moscow. The characteristic of the movement is the use of scientific research and summary methods to generalize the advanced experience of Stakhanovite workers, and then teach this complete set of rationalized experience to all workers. Kovalev's experience proves that this is the most scientific method to systematically and in a planned way transform the vast number of workers into Stakhanovite workers.
    It is no accident that Kovalev's initiative was proposed during the fifteenth anniversary of the Stakhanovite movement. Production competition, one of the laws of development of socialist society, embodies the initiative of millions of people, is advancing along a broad road. A large number of Stakhanovite people, production teams, workshops, and Stakhanovite factories are emerging continuously. Kovalev's method was born to meet this need. Using his method can ensure that every enterprise becomes a Stakhanovite enterprise.
    Kovalev's initiative has been approved by the Standing Committee of the Moscow Oblast Committee of the Communist Party, the Presidium of the Moscow Oblast Trade Union Committee, and the Committee of the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry. Government industrial ministries and central committees of industrial trade unions have called on all enterprises to promote Kovalev's method. Kovalev's method is considered applicable not only to light industrial enterprises but also to coal and iron mining, oil fields, metallurgy, machine manufacturing, and other enterprises.
    Before becoming the director of the "Proletarian Victory" factory, Kovalev was its chief engineer. He saw that the experience of many Stakhanovite workers needed to be studied, summarized, and promoted in order to achieve greater industrial development. He saw shortcomings in the work of studying and promoting the experience of Stakhanovite workers: a lack of strict systems, insufficient absorption of technical personnel, and a lack of careful consideration of organizational methods. Therefore, Stakhanovite workers often had to promote their own experience and did not receive the necessary technical and methodological assistance. He estimated that promoting the experience of Stakhanovites in such a situation would also bring out some less rational actions, and the scope of promotion would be limited. Kovalev and all the engineers and technicians of the "Proletarian Victory" factory worked together to find new methods and finally found it.
    Kovalev has briefly described this method, which has been tested in practice at the "Proletarian Victory" factory for two years and successfully implemented in thousands of factories in the Soviet Union, at a meeting of Stakhanovite workers, engineers, technicians, and Party and trade union leaders of enterprises in the Moscow Oblast, and in the newspaper *Pravda*.
    The first step of Kovalev's method is to study and analyze the work of each Stakhanovite worker. The results of the study and analysis confirmed that Stakhanovite workers in any occupation perform the same production procedures using different production actions. One worker's action is very rational and takes very little time. Another worker's action is not rational and takes more time, but he spends less time on the next action than the former worker. If their good experiences are combined, a perfect method for completing a certain production procedure can be obtained. For example, the "Proletarian Victory" factory has three female Stakhanovite workers—Kozlova, Anisimova, and Zykina. Take their two basic production procedures—joining warp threads and changing shuttles—as an example. The standard time for changing shuttles is 2.8 seconds. Kozlova used 2.5 seconds, Anisimova used 3.2 seconds, and Zykina used 3.4 seconds. In other words, Kozlova exceeded the standard, while the other two did not meet the standard. The standard time for joining warp threads is 16.5 seconds. Kozlova used 25 seconds, Anisimova used 14 seconds, and Zykina used 30 seconds. All three used their own actions to complete this production procedure. Kozlova's actions were the most rational when it came to changing the shuttle; Anisimova's were the most rational when it came to joining threads. Zykina's actions in these two production procedures cannot be considered rational. However, she allocated her working time very well, minimizing the downtime of the loom, so her production still exceeded the target. If the work of all Stakhanovite workers in the same occupation is studied, it becomes even more complicated. Weavers have five basic production actions, and spinners have four basic production actions. To be proficient in the business, one must be proficient in these actions, and at the same time, one must complete these actions correctly. This means planning working time correctly and organizing working conditions rationally. Kovalev said that the Stakhanovite workers' method of planning working time and the method of organizing work positions are as important as the Stakhanovite workers' working methods. Only by studying and summarizing advanced experience according to each action and each production procedure of each Stakhanovite worker, and then promoting it on a large scale, can the greatest success be achieved.
    According to the materials of the production time calculation table and the opinions of the foremen, select two or three Stakhanovite workers who complete a certain production procedure most quickly for study. According to Kovalev's experience, when introducing a production procedure, one cannot rely solely on the example of one Stakhanovite worker, but must compare several examples. This introduction to a production procedure should be brought to the workshop technical meeting to be discussed by the workshop director, foreman, deputy foreman, technical instructor, and Stakhanovite workers to select the best actions to complete a production procedure. For example, workers Kozlova and Vasilyeva of the "Proletarian Victory" factory both completed the action of changing shuttles in 2.5 seconds, but Vasilyeva changed the shuttle while the loom was still running, which is not allowed. Therefore, the technical meeting did not recommend Vasilyeva's method and asked her to learn Kozlova's method. One weaver worked very quickly, but only used one hand, so the work seemed too tense. The technical meeting did not adopt this method either. The technical meeting approved actions that could be completed quickly, easily, and evenly. When approving an action, its role in saving raw materials and improving quality was also taken into account.
    The second step of Kovalev's method is to establish the conditions necessary for implementing the labor methods of Stakhanovite workers. Therefore, the workshop technical meeting also pays special attention to the equipment situation. If the machine or lathe is not properly prepared, the workers will not be able to learn good production actions even if they are willing to. Therefore, at the technical meeting, the foreman, deputy foreman, and Stakhanovite workers must explain what preparatory measures must be taken before adopting new methods and set a deadline for completing these measures. The organization of working conditions is very important. For example, when promoting the Stakhanovite workers' method of changing shuttles, each loom must have many spare shuttles. One factory did not have a large number of spare shuttles, so it was impossible to adopt the "Proletarian Victory" factory's method of changing shuttles.
    The actions of Stakhanovite workers passed by the workshop technical meeting must be finally approved by the factory's Technical Methods Propaganda Committee, and the factory's chief engineer must participate in the approval. After the best actions are approved, they are first taught to the workshop's technical instructors, Stakhanovite workers, deputy foremen, and technical personnel, and then a concise instruction manual introducing the actions is compiled and distributed to the workers. When everything in the workshop is ready, that is, the equipment is arranged, the teaching personnel are trained, the instruction manual is distributed to the workers, and slogans and propaganda posters are hung up, the third step begins.
    The third step of Kovalev's method is to widely promote those qualified and improved actions of Stakhanovite workers. A small number of workers in the same department are gathered together, and well-trained comrades teach them for one and a half to two hours, and then the instructors and Stakhanovite workers guide them. The instructors teach the workers to perform the new actions correctly and correct their mistakes. If the students learn the skills the first time, then the name of the action, the name of the student, the date of the review, the time spent on the production procedure, the learning results, and the instructor's opinions are recorded in a specially prepared notebook. If it is not taught the first time, it is taught again the second time. A female worker, Makarova, spent three seconds on the first day of learning the new method of changing shuttles, which was 0.2 seconds more than the standard time, because she did not use the correct hand to change the shuttle; the next day the action was correct, but it was still 0.2 seconds slow; on the third day, she had learned the new method and only spent 2.8 seconds.
    When widely promoting the actions of Stakhanovite workers, special attention must be paid to workers with short work experience, as well as workers with long work experience who perform individual production actions incorrectly and take a lot of time. After almost all the workers in the entire workshop have learned the new actions, they continue to learn the next action. Some workers who cannot keep up with the progress are organized separately to continue learning. It usually takes two or three weeks to study and adopt a production action.
    Kovalev pointed out that the technical friendship and mutual assistance between Stakhanovite workers and technical personnel plays a great role in effectively promoting the methods of Stakhanovite workers. When the factory was studying the production procedure of taking yarn, no production team could complete it according to the standard time. Later, the technical personnel came up with a new method, which overcame the difficulties. Another factory often produced semi-finished products of poor quality. The engineers studied it in many ways but found no results. Later, when studying the actions of Stakhanovite workers, it was found that most workers produced defective products due to incorrect methods. This example shows that, on the one hand, Stakhanovite workers enriched the knowledge of engineers and technicians with their own experience, and on the other hand, technical personnel helped workers understand technical issues.
    This method of the "Proletarian Victory" factory of studying and promoting the experience of Stakhanovite workers according to production procedures and production actions has greatly increased labor productivity while keeping the equipment and the number of workers unchanged: in a short period of time, spinning increased by 20 percent, and weaving increased by 5 percent; the number of workers producing according to the new standards increased from 80 percent to 99 percent in spinning, and from 85 percent to 96 percent in weaving. More and more light and heavy industrial enterprises that have adopted Kovalev's method are reporting the significant production achievements they have achieved. "Studying excellent labor methods, popularizing them to all workers, and widely promoting them in production—this is a huge task for the national economy."

　　柯沃列夫推广先进生产经验的方法
    李何
    最近，苏联各工业企业正展开一个大规模地、有计划地推广先进的生产动作的运动。运动的创始人是莫斯科“无产阶级胜利”细呢绒制造厂厂长柯沃列夫工程师。运动的特色是：用科学的研究和总结的方法，概括斯塔哈诺夫工人的先进经验，然后把这整套合理化的经验教给全体工人。柯沃列夫的经验证明：这是有组织地、有计划地使广大工人成为斯塔哈诺夫工人的最科学的方法。
    柯沃列夫的创议，在斯塔哈诺夫运动十五周年时候提出，这不是偶然的。作为社会主义社会发展的规律之一的生产竞赛，体现着千百万群众的积极性的生产竞赛，正循着宽阔的道路前进着。大批的斯塔哈诺夫式人、生产组、车间、和斯塔哈诺夫式的工厂，正源源不绝地涌现出来。柯沃列夫的方法，正是适应这种需要而产生的。采用他的方法，就可以保证每一个企业成为斯塔哈诺夫式的企业。
    柯沃列夫的创议，已获得联共党莫斯科州委常委会、莫斯科州工会委员会主席团、苏联轻工业部委员会的批准。政府各工业部和各工业工会中央委员会均号召各企业推广柯沃列夫的方法。柯沃列夫的方法，被认为不仅应当采用到轻工业企业中去，而且应当采用到煤铁开采、油田、冶金、机器制造等等企业中去。
    柯沃列夫就任“无产阶级胜利”工厂的厂长之前，是该厂的总工程师。他看到了许多斯塔哈诺夫工人的经验，需要加以研究，总结和推广，使工业获得更大的发展。他看到了研究和推广斯塔哈诺夫工人的经验的工作还有缺点：缺乏严格的制度，吸收技术人员不够，往往没有很好考虑组织的方式；所以，斯塔哈诺夫工人常常要自己来推广经验，得不到必须的技术上和方法上的帮助。他估计到在这样的情形下来推广斯塔哈诺夫者的经验，是会把其中不很合理的动作也夹带出去，而且推广的范围要受到限制。柯沃列夫和“无产阶级胜利”工厂的全体工程师和技师一起，努力寻找新的方法，终于找到了它。
    柯沃列夫曾把这个经“无产阶级胜利”工厂的两年实践考验过的方法，经苏联千百家工厂试行成功的方法，在莫斯科州各企业斯塔哈诺夫工人、工程师、技师、和党、工会领导干部的会议上和真理报上，作了扼要的说明。
    柯沃列夫方法的第一步，就是研究和分析各个斯塔哈诺夫工人的工作。研究和分析的结果，肯定了任何职业的斯塔哈诺夫工人都是以不同的生产动作来做同一段生产手续的。某一工人动作做得很合理，花了极少的时间。另一工人做得不合理，花的时间较多，但他在下一动作上却比前一工人花的时间少些。如果把他们好的经验结合在一起，就可以得到完成某一段生产手续的完善方法。例如，“无产阶级胜利”工厂有三个女斯塔哈诺夫工人——柯兹洛娃、安尼西莫娃、齐金娜。拿她们的两段基本生产手续——接经线和换梭来说。换梭的标准时间为二点八秒。柯兹洛娃用了二点五秒，安尼西莫娃用了三点二秒，齐金娜用了三点四秒。换句话说，柯兹洛娃超过了标准，其余二人不及标准。接线的标准时间为一六点五秒，柯兹洛娃用了二十五秒，安尼西莫娃用了十四秒，齐金娜用了三十秒。三个人都以自己的动作来完成这一段生产手续。在换梭上，最合理的是柯兹洛娃；在接线上，最合理的是安尼西莫娃。齐金娜在这两段生产手续上所做的动作却不能算是合理的。但她把工作时间分配得很好，使织布机停顿的时间减低到最低限度，因而生产还是超过任务。如果把同一职业的所有斯塔哈诺夫工人的工作情形都研究一下，那么就更复杂了。织布工人有五个基本生产动作，纺纱工人有四个基本生产动作。要精通业务，就要精通这些动作，同时还要正确地完成这些动作，这就是说要正确地计划工作时间和合理地组织工作条件。柯沃列夫说：斯塔哈诺夫工人计划工作时间的方法，和组织工作位置的方法，是跟斯塔哈诺夫工人的工作方法，有同样重要意义的。只要按各个斯塔哈诺夫工人的各个动作和各段生产手续来研究和总结先进的经验，然后大规模地推广它，才能获得最大的成功。
    根据生产时间计算表的材料和领班的意见，挑出两三个最迅速地完成某一段生产手续的斯塔哈诺夫工人来研究。按柯沃列夫的经验，在介绍其一段生产手续时不能仅仅依靠某一斯塔哈诺夫工人的例子，而是要拿几个例子来比较。这种对于某一段生产手续的介绍，要拿到车间技术会议上，由车间长、领班、副领班、技术指导员和斯塔哈诺夫工人来讨论，挑选出那些在完成某一段生产手续中最好的动作。例如“无产阶级胜利”工厂工人柯兹洛娃和瓦西列娃两人都以二点五秒完成了换梭的动作，但是瓦西列娃是在织布机还在转动的时候换的，这是不允许的，因此技术会议不推荐瓦西列娃的方法，而且叫她学习柯兹洛娃的方法。有一个织工动作做得很快，但是只用一只手，因而工作显得过分紧张，技术会议同样也不采用这个方法。技术会议所批准的是那些能够迅速，安闲和匀称地完成的动作，在批准某一动作时，也估计到它在节约原料和提高质量方面的作用。
    柯沃列夫方法的第二步，是建立为实施斯塔哈诺夫工人的劳动方法所必需的条件。因此，车间技术会议也特别重视装备的情况。如果机器或车床没有适当的准备，工人们即使愿意也是不能学会好的生产动作的。所以，在技术会议上，领班、副领班、斯塔哈诺夫工作者要说明在采行新方法之前，要采取什么样的预备措施，并且订出完成这一措施的期限。工作条件的组织是很重要的。譬如，在推行斯塔哈诺夫工人的换梭方法时，每架织布机必须有许多预备梭。有一家工厂没有预备大量的梭，所以无法采用“无产阶级胜利”工厂的换梭方法。
    车间技术会议通过的斯塔哈诺夫工人的动作，最后须经工厂的技术方法宣传委员会议批准，在批准时一定要有该工厂的总工程师参加。最好的动作获得批准之后，首先把它们教给车间的技术指导员、斯塔哈诺夫工人、副领班和技术人员，然后编写介绍动作的简洁的说明书，印发给工人。当车间里一切都准备好停留，即：装备安排好，教导的人员训练好，说明书发给了工人，标语、宣传画挂了起来，第三步也就开始了。
    柯沃列夫方法的第三步是：广泛推广那些审查合格的完善的斯塔哈诺夫工人的动作。把人数不多的同一部门的工人召集在一起，在一个半到两个钟头内，由受过很好训练的同志来教授，然后由指导员和斯塔哈诺夫工人加以指导。指导员教工人们正确地做新的动作，并纠正他们的错误。如果受教者第一次就学会了本领，那么就把动作的名目、受教者的名字、审查的日期、花在生产手续上的时间、学习的成绩、指导员的意见，记录在特别预备的簿子上。第一次没有教会，第二次再教。有一个女工马卡洛娃，在学习新的换梭方法的第一天，花了三秒，比起标准时间多花了○点二秒，因为不是用应用的那只手去换梭；第二天动作对了，但还是慢○点二秒；第三天她已经学会了新方法，时间只花二点八秒。
    广泛推广斯塔哈诺夫工人的动作，必须特别注意那些工龄轻的工人，以及那些工龄大但个别生产动作做得不对、而且时间花得多的工人。全车间的工人差不多都学会了新的动作后，再继续学习下一动作。赶不上进度的一些工人则另行组织起来继续学习。研究和采用某一个生产动作，通常要两三个星期。
    柯沃列夫指出，斯塔哈诺夫工人与技术人员之间，在技术上的友好互助，对于有效地推广斯塔哈诺夫工人的方法的作用很大。该厂在研究取纱的生产手续的时候，没有一个生产组能按标准时间完成。后来技术人员想出了新方法，才克服了困难。另一个工厂经常生产质量差的半制成品，工程师多方面研究都没有结果。后来在研究斯塔哈诺夫工人的动作时，发现大多数工人因方法不正确而生产了废品。这个例子说明，一方面斯塔哈诺夫工人以自己的经验丰富了工程师和技师的知识，另一方面技术人员则帮助工人了解技术上的问题。
    “无产阶级胜利”工厂这种按照生产手续和生产动作来研究和推广斯塔哈诺夫工人经验的方法，使它在装备和工人数量不变的情形下，大大地提高了劳动生产率：在短短期间，纺纱增加了百分之二十，织布增加了百分之五；按照新标准生产的工人数目，在纺纱方面由百分之八十增加到百分之九十九，在织布方面由百分之八十五增加到百分之九十六。采用柯沃列夫方法的轻重工业企业，愈来愈多地报告它们所获得的显著的生产成绩。“研究优良的劳动方法，把它们普及到一切工人中去，广泛地推广到生产中去，——这就是国民经济的巨大任务。”
