	The New Stage of the Korean People's Liberation War
	The Korean People's Liberation War has been going on for more than two months. The current characteristic of the war situation is: on the one hand, the US aggressor troops and the Syngman Rhee puppet army are desperately holding on to the rectangle area of ​​Daegu, Gyeongju, Masan, and Busan; on the other hand, the Korean People's Army is constantly inflicting heavy blows on them. The war is becoming increasingly tense and fierce.
	Currently, the US aggressor troops and the remnant Syngman Rhee puppet army are resisting stubbornly by using various conditions: (1) The defense line is shorter than before, and the troops are more concentrated than before. The US military has concentrated about 100,000 troops of six divisions (the 25th Infantry Division, the reorganized 24th Division after being annihilated, the 1st Cavalry Division, the 2nd Infantry Division, the 1st Marine Division, and the recently added 7th Division) on a small piece of land less than 10 percent of southern Korea. There are also 40,000 to 50,000 Syngman Rhee puppet troops, police, and constabulary. In addition, they are frantically arresting Korean youths over the age of seventeen or even fourteen in the to-be-liberated areas to replenish the cannon fodder. (2) The US military not only relies on the Nakdong River and Mt. Bohyeon (between Cheongsong and Yeongcheon) as natural defense lines, but also has built a large number of concrete bunkers, laid minefields, and other strong fortifications to carry out stubborn resistance. Because they are afraid of the People's Army breaking through the defense line, encircling, and annihilating them, they have also adopted a deep defense deployment. (3) Under the cover of a large number of airplanes and tanks, they are launching frantic local counterattacks. (4) They are intensifying the atrocities of burning, killing, looting, and raping in the war zone and the barbaric bombing of the rear, and are strengthening their activities of shelling, raiding, and landing harassment on the Korean coast with naval vessels.
	However, all these struggling measures by the US aggressors still cannot stop the powerful hammer blows of the Korean People's Army. In the month from mid-August to the present, the People's Army has made significant progress on all fronts. The People's Army still firmly holds the initiative in the war, not only crushing the enemy's frantic counterattacks with twice the tenacity of the enemy, but also breaking through the enemy's solid defenses and desperate resistance everywhere, and continuing to advance steadily. On the east coast, the entire line from Waegwan to Pohang is advancing. One after another, important strategic strongholds such as Waegwan, Uiheung, Dabu-dong, Pohang, Angang, and Yeongcheon have been liberated. They have crossed Mt. Bohyeon, which the enemy relies on as a "natural barrier", and are now dividing their forces to approach Daegu and Gyeongju. On the Nakdong River front, after crossing the river in the Waegwan area on August 7, the People's Army launched a large-scale crossing of the river on August 31, breaking through the US military's defense line in seventeen places. On September 1, they liberated the important road intersection of Yeongsan, advancing from the south to Daegu, only twelve miles away from the highway from Busan to Daegu. On the south coast, they have successively liberated Namhae Island and the important strategic stronghold of Haman, approaching Masan and Jinhae. At the same time, the People's Army continues to annihilate the enemy's living forces in large numbers, destroying and capturing the enemy's aircraft, tanks and other equipment. The People's Army Headquarters recently announced that a total of more than 15,000 US troops were killed and more than 1,700 captured in July and August. And in September, the figures remain quite high. For example, in the fierce offensive on the east bank of the Nakdong River from September 1 to 4, a total of more than 2,600 US troops were killed or wounded, more than 250 captured, 38 armored vehicles and 13 tanks destroyed, and 14 tanks and 82 artillery pieces of various types seized. For another example, in the ten days of fierce fighting south of Pohang up to the 6th, a total of more than 6,000 enemy troops were killed or wounded, more than 500 captured, 12 tanks and 20 artillery pieces seized. According to the People's Army's battle report on September 6, 30 tanks were captured in one fell swoop on the south coast. In the past two months, more than 100 enemy aircraft have been shot down. And in the first ten days of September, according to incomplete statistics, another 21 enemy aircraft were shot down. The Korean people's anti-US war is entering a more intense and arduous stage. The Korean people are being tempered to be more courageous and tenacious in the flames of war, full of the belief in victory, and striving for the complete liberation of their homeland.
	
	The Struggle Between Aggression and Anti-Aggression in Japan
	The struggle between aggression and anti-aggression is developing sharply in Japan.
	US imperialism has openly used Japan as a land, sea, and air base, supply station, and armory for the aggression against Korea, carrying out its criminal war of aggression. In order to prepare for launching a new war of aggression, US imperialism is at the same time stepping up the rearmament of the remnants of the Japanese fascists under its long-term patronage to serve as its tool of aggression. The core of the regularized new army, under the name of the so-called "Police Reserve Force," has recruited nearly 40,000 personnel, and is employing Japanese officers who have engaged in aggressive activities to take charge of the training and leadership of the force. The strength of the "Maritime Safety Agency," from personnel to ships, is being doubled, and plans are being made to establish a "Maritime Safety University," "Maritime Safety School," and "Maritime Safety Training Center," as well as scheming to revive the "Naval Academy," preparing to conduct large-scale naval training. The Japanese war industry illegally retained by the US occupiers is manufacturing war materials for the United States. In the two months since the start of the Korean War, the United States has placed orders for $40 million worth of military supplies from them.
	In order to clear the way for its aggressive adventures, the US occupiers have directed the Japanese reactionaries to violently attack Japan's peaceful and democratic forces. The atrocities of searching for and arresting Japanese Communist Party leaders continue, and incidents of unwarranted arrests of JCP members are emerging endlessly. Following the "dismissal" and "rectification" of a large number of journalists and electrical workers, illegal measures to forcibly dissolve progressive trade unions have begun. The All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Council, the largest progressive trade union in Japan, has been unreasonably declared dissolved.
	However, the Japanese people of today are not the Japanese people of five years ago. The broad masses of the Japanese people are now selflessly launching a movement against the war of aggression and to defend peace. The patriotic Japanese people, led by the working class, are not only refusing to serve the war of aggression, but are also actively fighting for peace and national independence. Anti-war leaflets are being distributed everywhere. Transportation, railway, and shipbuilding workers have launched strikes. Sailors refuse to return to ships bound for South Korea. Steelworkers refuse to produce military supplies. Unemployed workers in Kanagawa Prefecture are not tempted by high salaries and refuse to transport ammunition used to slaughter their Korean brothers. At the same time, since the Korean War, the movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Peace Appeal has been unfolding even more widely and vigorously in Japan. From factories to rural areas, from schools to temples, patriotic people from all walks of life are working together to promote the signature campaign. Now, more than five million Japanese people have signed the peace declaration. This huge number clearly demonstrates the determination of the Japanese people to oppose the imperialist war of aggression and defend peace.
	
	The Soviet Union's Victorious Struggle in the Security Council
	It has been a month and a half since the Soviet representative Malik resumed attending the Security Council meetings on August 1. In this month and a half, Malik's struggle in the Security Council, representing the strong will of the people of the world to defend the United Nations and world peace, has achieved a major political victory.
	The Soviet representative resumed attending the Security Council meetings under the following circumstances: US imperialism, with the sponsorship of its vassal states, had already provoked a war of aggression in Korea, had already carried out armed aggression against China's territory of Taiwan, and was preparing to use the Security Council as a cover to expand the war. Therefore, since attending the Security Council on August 1, the Soviet representative has proposed recognizing the representative of the People's Republic of China as the representative of China and peacefully resolving the Korean issue as the primary agenda. After Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai successively requested the Security Council to sanction the US aggression against Taiwan and the crime of infringing upon our country's borders on August 24 and 29, the Soviet representative proposed that the issue of accusing the United States of armed aggression against Chinese territory and accusing US aircraft of infringing upon Chinese territory be included in the agenda. However, US imperialism tried to veto or tamper with the above agenda, and proposed that the so-called case of accusing aggression against the Republic of Korea and the establishment of an investigation team to China to investigate the infringement incidents be included in the agenda, attempting to continue to use the Security Council as a tool to cover up its aggression and conceal its crimes of infringing on China's airspace. Therefore, in the 20 meetings of the Security Council held from August 1 to September 12, a fierce struggle between two lines unfolded around these agendas.
	Although US imperialism, holding the majority in the Security Council, made every effort to obstruct and prolong the process of the Security Council on procedural issues, and later vetoed the Soviet Union's proposed agenda of allowing the representative of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Security Council and peacefully resolving the Korean issue, due to the Soviet representative's just struggle, the Security Council had to pass the inclusion of the two cases proposed by the Soviet Union, accusing the United States of aggression against Taiwan and accusing US aircraft of infringing on Chinese territory, in the agenda, thereby making US imperialism, which has always been arrogant and domineering by holding a majority, formally sit in the defendant's seat in the Security Council for the first time. At the same time, due to the Soviet Union's firm opposition, the Security Council had to reject the United States' shameless proposal to accuse the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the US attempt to pass an investigation team to China to carry out espionage activities, completely defeating the US intentions.
	The Soviet representative's resumption of attending the Security Council meetings and putting forward the agenda of demanding sanctions against aggression first severely attacked the US imperialist conspiracy to manipulate the Security Council to expand the war of aggression. As Pravda pointed out on August 14: "Since the Soviet representative has served as the chairman of the Security Council, it has ended the shameless arbitrariness of the United States."
	Secondly, the Soviet representative, through the struggle in the Security Council, further exposed to the people of the world that US imperialism is the aggressor of Korea, the aggressor of China, and the mortal enemy of the peace-loving people of the world. In his righteous and stern speeches, Malik refuted all the deceptive propaganda of US imperialism to the point where it was utterly devastated, and proved the ironclad US imperialist crimes of aggression with irrefutable facts.
	Thirdly, the Soviet representative's struggle in the Security Council has powerfully disrupted the steps of the imperialist camp. The voting records in the Security Council when voting on the various agendas proposed by the Soviet Union clearly showed the unprecedented chaos between the United States and its servant countries. In particular, when voting on the Soviet Union's proposal to invite the Chinese representative to participate in the Security Council's discussion of the case of accusing US aircraft of bombing China on September 12, as many as six votes in the Security Council supported the Soviet proposal. Among the permanent members of the Security Council, only the United States voted against it. This fact fully exposes how difficult it is for the United States to coerce its servant countries to risk the strong resistance of the people of the world to carry out the war of aggression when they are facing defeat.
	Finally, the Soviet representative's struggle in the Security Council has promoted the great movement of the people of the world against aggression and to defend peace. Various groups and organizations representing hundreds of millions of people have endlessly sent telegrams to the Security Council supporting the Soviet proposals. More than 20,000 such telegrams were received in the one month that Malik served as the chairman of the Security Council. This powerful movement, together with the peace signature movement that has unfolded more widely after the US war of aggression against Korea, has become a powerful demonstration against the aggressors.

    朝鲜人民解放战争的新阶段
    朝鲜人民解放战争，已经进行两个多月了，目前战局的特点是：一方面，美国侵略军和李承晚伪军正拚死固守大邱、庆州、马山、釜山矩形地带，另一方面，朝鲜人民军则不断予以沉重的打击。战争呈现与日俱增的紧张和激烈。
    现在美国侵略军及李承晚残余伪军正利用各种条件进行顽抗：（一）防线较前缩短，兵力较前集中。美军在不足朝鲜南部百分之十的狭小土地上，集中了六个师（步兵第二十五师、被歼后重新补整的第二十四师、骑兵第一师、步兵第二师、海军陆战队第一师、及最近增加的第七师）约十万人左右的兵力。还有李承晚伪军、警、宪兵四五万人。此外，又正在疯狂地在待解放区抓捕十七岁甚至十四岁以上的朝鲜青年来补充炮灰。（二）美军不仅凭借洛东江和普贤山（青松与永川之间）作为天然防御线，而且还构筑了大量的水泥碉堡，布设了地雷阵地和其他强固的防御工事，借以进行顽抗。由于害怕人民军的突破防线、包围、歼灭，又采取了纵深防御的部署。（三）在大量飞机、坦克的掩护下进行局部性的疯狂反攻。（四）加紧在战区的烧杀淫掠和对前后方野蛮轰炸的暴行，并以海军舰只加强对朝鲜沿海的轰击、偷袭及登陆骚扰的活动。
    但是，美国侵略者这一切挣扎性的措施，仍然阻止不住朝鲜人民军的强大锤击。从八月中旬到现在的一个月以来，人民军在各个战线上仍有显著的进展。人民军仍紧握着战争的主动权，不仅以比敌人加倍的顽强性粉碎着敌人的疯狂反扑，并且到处突破敌人的坚固防御和拼死抵抗，继续稳步地前进。东海岸方面，从倭馆到浦项全线推进。先后解放了倭馆、义兴、多富洞、浦项、安康、永川等一连串的重要战略据点，越过了敌人恃为“天险”的普贤山，现正分兵逼近大邱和庆州。洛东江方面，人民军继八月七日在倭馆地区渡江之后，八月三十一日又大举渡江，突破美军防线十七处。九月一日解放了重要公路交叉点灵山，从南方进逼大邱，距釜山到大邱的公路仅十二哩。南海岸方面，先后解放了南海岛和重要战略据点咸安，迫近马山和镇海。与此同时，人民军继续大量地歼灭敌人的有生力量，击毁并缴获敌人的飞机坦克等装备。人民军总部最近公布七、八两月内共击毙美军一万五千多人，俘掳一千七百多人。而九月份仍然保持相当高的数字。如洛东江东岸九月一日至四日的猛烈进攻，共毙伤美军二千六百多名，俘掳二百五十多名，击毁装甲车三十八辆及坦克十三辆，缴获坦克十四辆，各种炮八十二门。又如在浦项以南的至六日为止的十天激战中，共毙伤敌军六千余人，俘五百余人，缴获坦克十二辆，炮二十门。又据人民军九月六日的战报，南海岸方面，一举就缴获坦克三十辆。在过去两个月中，已击落敌机一百多架。而九月份头十天中，据不完全统计，又击落了敌机二十一架。朝鲜人民的反美战争正步入更激烈更艰苦的阶段。朝鲜人民正在战争的烽火中锻炼得更勇敢、更坚韧，满怀胜利的信念，争取国土的完全解放。
    侵略与反侵略的斗争在日本
    侵略与反侵略的斗争，正在日本尖锐地发展着。
    美帝国主义已公开将日本作为侵略朝鲜的陆、海、空军基地，兵站和军火库，进行着罪恶的侵略战争。为了准备发动新的侵略战争，美帝国主义同时正在加紧重新武装其长期卵翼下的日本法西斯余孽，以充当其侵略工具。正规化的新陆军的核心，在所谓“警察后备队”的名义下，已召募了近四万名人员，并正起用曾经进行过侵略活动的日本军官，担任该部队的训练及领导工作。“海上保安厅”从人员到舰艇的实力，都在加倍扩充中，并计划设立“海上保安大学”、“海上保安学校”、“海上保安训练所”，以及阴谋复活“海军大学”，准备大规模进行海军的训练。美国占领者非法保留下来的日本战争工业，正在替美国制造战争物资。在朝鲜战争开始后的二个月中，美国已向它们订购了四千万美元的军事物资。
    美国占领者为了替其侵略冒险扫清道路，指使日本反动派横暴地进攻日本的和平民主力量。搜捕日本共产党领袖的暴行在继续着，日共党员被无理逮捕的事件，层出不穷，继大批新闻工作者、电气工人被“解雇”与“整肃”后，强制解散进步工会的非法措施，业已开始。日本最大的进步工会全日工会联络协议会，已被无理地宣布解散。
    但是，今天的日本人民，已不是五年前的日本人民。广大的日本人民目前正奋不顾身地展开了反对侵略战争和保卫和平的运动。以工人阶级为首的日本爱国人民，不仅拒绝为侵略战争服务，并且积极地为争取和平与民族独立而斗争。反战传单在各地散发着。搬运、铁道、造船工人，展开了怠工的斗争。海员拒绝重返驶往南朝鲜的船只。钢铁工人拒绝军需生产。神奈川县的失业工人不受高薪的诱惑，拒绝担任运输用来屠杀朝鲜兄弟的弹药的工作。同时，自从朝鲜战争以来，征集斯德哥尔摩和平宣言签名的运动，已在日本更加普遍而蓬勃地展开。从工厂到农村，从学校到寺院，各阶层的爱国人民协力推进签名运动。现在，已有五百万以上的日本人民在和平宣言上签了名。这个巨大的数字，明确地表明了日本人民反对帝国主义侵略战争与保卫和平的决心。
    苏联在安理会内进行的胜利斗争
    自从苏联代表马立克于八月一日起重新出席安理会会议以来，已经一个半月过去了，在这一个半月中，马立克代表着全世界人民保卫联合国，保卫世界和平的坚强意志在安理会进行的斗争，已经取得了政治上的重大胜利。
    苏联代表是在这样的情况下重新出席安理会会议的，即：美帝国主义在其附庸国赞助下，已经在朝鲜挑起了侵略战争，已经对中国领土台湾实行了武装侵略，并正准备利用安理会为掩护以扩大战争。因此，苏联代表自八月一日出席安理会起，就提出以承认中华人民共和国代表为中国代表，与和平解决朝鲜问题为首要议程。而在八月二十四日与二十九日我周恩来外长先后要求安理会制裁美国侵略台湾与侵犯我国境的罪行以后，苏联代表又提出以控诉美国武装侵略中国领土问题与控诉美国飞机侵犯中国领土问题列入议程。但是，美帝国主义则力图否决或窜改上项议程，并提出以所谓控诉对大韩民国的侵略案与成立调查团到中国调查侵犯事件案列入议程，企图继续利用安理会为掩护其侵略的工具，并掩饰其侵犯中国领空的罪行。因此，从八月一日至九月十二日安理会举行的二十次会议上，便是围绕着这些议程而展开了激烈的两条路线的斗争。
    虽然美帝国主义挟持着安理会内的多数进行百般阻挠，安理会的进程长期停顿在程序问题上，并在以后又否决了苏联所提使中华人民共和国代表参加安理会，与和平解决朝鲜问题的议程，但是由于苏联代表的正义斗争，安理会竟不得不通过将苏联所提控诉美国侵略台湾与控诉美国飞机侵犯中国领土两案列入议程，从而使素来以挟持多数而骄纵恣肆的美帝国主义，第一次在安理会内正式居于被告的地位。同时，由于苏联的坚决反对，安理会不得不否决了美国控诉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的无耻提案与美国企图通过调查团到中国来进行间谍活动的阴谋，使美国的意图完全归于失败。
    苏联代表之重新出席安理会会议与提出要求制裁侵略的议程，首先就严重地打击了美帝国主义操纵安理会以扩大侵略战争的阴谋。如真理报八月十四日所指出：“自从苏联代表担任安理会主席以后，即终止了美国无耻的专断行为。”
    其次，苏联代表通过在安理会中的斗争，向全世界人民进一步揭露了美帝国主义乃是朝鲜的侵略者、中国的侵略者与世界爱好和平人民的死敌。马立克在其义正辞严的发言中，把美帝国主义的一切欺骗宣传驳斥得体无完肤，而以无可辩驳的事实证实了铁案如山的美帝国主义侵略罪状。
    再次，苏联代表在安理会内的斗争已有力地打乱了帝国主义阵营的步骤，安理会在表决苏联所提各项议程时的投票记录，就明白表现了美国与其仆从国家间的空前混乱，特别是九月十二日表决苏联所提应邀中国代表参加安理会讨论控诉美机轰炸中国案时，安理会赞成苏联提案的多至六票，在安理会常任理事国中，仅美国一国投反对票。这个事实充分暴露了美国在胁迫其仆从国家冒全世界人民的强大反抗来此，他们为了挽救面临败亡进行侵略战争时，有多么困难。
    最后，苏联代表在安理会内的斗争，推动了全世界人民反对侵略、保卫和平的巨大运动。代表着亿万人类的各种团体与组织，无穷无尽地致电安理会支持苏联提案，仅在马立克担任安理会主席的一个月内，就收到了二万封以上这样的电报。这一强有力的运动与在美国侵略朝鲜战争发生以后更加广泛展开的和平签名运动在一起，已成为对于侵略者的强大示威。
