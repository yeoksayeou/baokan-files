　　National Trade Union Club Conference
    Determines Guiding Principles for Trade Union Club Work
    [Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] The National Trade Union Club Conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions discussed and resolved the main problems existing in the current work of trade union clubs, and adopted the organizational regulations of trade union clubs, the election regulations for club management committees, and the working regulations.
    The conference believes that clubs should truly become the central places for cultural and recreational activities for the broad masses of workers, staff, and their families, and that the clear purpose of club work should be to improve the political, cultural, and technical level of workers and staff.
    Therefore, (1) club activities should pay attention to combining with production and serving production; (2) the current literary and artistic work policy of trade union clubs should focus on popularization; (3) club leaders should be produced through democratic elections, and clubs must have dedicated personnel in charge; (4) trade union clubs at all levels should be under the unified leadership of trade union committees at all levels; (5) for club funding, a strict budget and final accounting system should be established; for club property, a registration and management system should be implemented; (6) the focus of club work should be placed in factories or workshops.
    The conference was held in Beijing from August 21st to 27th. At the meeting, Li Lisan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech that trade union club work must absorb the participation of the broad masses of workers and staff. Only by relying on the masses can clubs be run well.
    According to incomplete statistics from nineteen regions including Tangshan, Harbin, Qingdao, Jinan, Fengfeng, Nanjing, Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Fushun, Anshan, Guangzhou, and Beijing, 733 grassroots trade union organizations have established clubs, and more than 280,000 workers and staff regularly participate in various club activities.

    【新华社三日讯】中华全国总工会召开的全国工会俱乐部会议，讨论并解决了目前工会俱乐部工作中存在的主要问题，通过了工会俱乐部的组织条例，俱乐部管理委员会的选举条例及工作条例。
    会议认为俱乐部应真正成为广大工人、职员群众及其家属文化娱乐活动的中心场所，俱乐部工作的明确目的应为提高工人、职员的政治、文化、技术水平。
    因此，（一）俱乐部的活动应注意与生产结合，为生产服务；（二）目前工会俱乐部的文艺工作方针应以普及为主；（三）俱乐部的领导人要经过民主选举产生，俱乐部须有专人负责；（四）各级工会俱乐部应归各级工会委员会统一领导；（五）对于俱乐部的经费，应建立严格的预决算制度；对于俱乐部的财产，应实行登记管理制度；（六）俱乐部工作的重点应该放在工厂或车间中。
    会议是八月二十一日至二十七日在北京举行的，会上全国总工会李立三副主席在讲话中指出：工会俱乐部工作一定要吸收广大工人、职员群众参加，只有依靠群众，才能把俱乐部办好。
    据唐山、哈尔滨、青岛、济南、峰峰、南京、沈阳、旅大、抚顺、鞍山、广州、北京等十九个地区不完全的统计，已有七百三十三个工会基层组织建立了俱乐部，有二十八万以上的职工经常参加俱乐部的各种活动。
