German Youth Fighting for Peace and Unity
—A Visit with German Youth Representative Harmut

When German youth representative Harmut, a member of the Central Committee of the Free German Youth League, spoke to reporters about his impressions of the new China, he said excitedly: The most exciting and pleasant thing about this visit to China was seeing the great achievements of China's construction work in the past year. Harmut said that German youth have a lofty respect and love for Chairman Mao Zedong. In Germany, many excellent youth work organizations use Mao Zedong's name as their title. The Chinese people drove out American and British imperialism, which is of great help to the freedom and unity of Germany. Harmut emphasized that the efforts and achievements of Chinese youth in defending world peace have made German youth feel infinitely excited. During his visit to New China, the labor enthusiasm, learning enthusiasm, and internationalist spirit shown by Chinese youth participating in the construction of their motherland have greatly encouraged German youth. Therefore, he firmly believes that the friendship between the Chinese and German people and youth will grow day by day.

When asked about the situation of German youth striving for freedom, unity, and defending world peace, Harmut briefly introduced the organization and work of the Free German Youth League. He also pointed out that the movement of German youth striving for unity and defending peace is led by the Youth League. The Free German Youth League currently has more than 2 million members, accounting for 53% of the youth in the German Democratic Republic. By the end of this year, it will be developed to the point where 75% of the youth in the Republic will participate in the League. The members of the Youth League take the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League as a model for learning; and they have also learned a lot of experience from Chinese youth. Their slogan is "Every German youth is a brave and active peace fighter! Every youth must defend peace!" After the All-German Youth Congress in May of this year, Stalin gave them a congratulatory telegram, which gave them great encouragement. They launched various work competitions to repay Stalin's expectations. During this period, the number of peace signatures collected by German youth reached 8 million, accounting for 47% of the total number of peace signatures in Germany. As of August 12, there were 13,784 units of organizations for defending world peace organized by youth in factories, enterprises, villages, and agencies in the German Democratic Republic. They also organized 28,632 peace movement propaganda teams to carry out propaganda work. In addition, 16,938 labor shock brigades were organized to prepare for the completion of the new five-year plan. The tasks of these shock brigades are to complete production plans, improve product quality, and save materials. They established 6,108 business groups in various factories, with 62,976 people strengthening their study of business technology. During the harvest season this year, 492,984 young people helped farmers harvest. In order to strengthen theoretical and ideological education, the members of the Youth League study "President Pieck's Biography," "Stalin's Biography," and "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union." This year, 183,235 members belonging to 12,952 groups participated in the competition for outstanding learning medals.

In West Germany, there are also organizations of the Youth League. Regardless of the extreme suppression by the West German occupiers, they actively work. For example, in Hamburg, there are more than 12,000 Youth League members who actively carry out propaganda work to defend peace. The West German 100,000 Youth Peace Conference and the Youth Peace Fighters Congress, which will be held in Dortmund in the Ruhr area from September 30 to October 1, have been banned by the West German occupiers, but this conference will definitely be held successfully. German youth will never be willing to see Germany split, and will never be cannon fodder for imperialism. If imperialism dares to provoke a war, German youth will undoubtedly stand on the side of the peace camp and are determined to defeat the imperialist offensive.

Harmut told reporters that Germany's achievements today would not be possible without the help of the Soviet Union. Since defeating the fascist Hitler's offensive, the Soviet Union has fully complied with the Potsdam Agreement in its treatment of Germany. Land reform was first implemented in Germany, confiscating the land of fascist war criminals, and all landlords with more than 100 hectares of land were nationalized and distributed to poor farmers. In terms of factories, the factories, coal mines, railways, and banks of fascist war criminals were nationalized. Thanks to these reforms, the Socialist Unity Party was able to propose a two-year plan. Thanks to the enthusiastic work of the German people and youth, this plan was completed ahead of schedule at the end of July. Harmut pointed out that the Soviet Union and the Eastern European people's democratic countries have provided a lot of help in completing this plan.

Last year, the number of German youth who signed to congratulate Stalin on his birthday reached 70% of the youth in the Republic.

Harmut said that in the American, British, and French occupied areas of West Germany, the lives of the West German people have deteriorated significantly. Due to the influence of the Marshall Plan, the German consumer goods industry has been squeezed out. There are now 4 million unemployed people in West Germany. The peace movement in West Germany is also suppressed. Before Harmut went abroad, all communist newspapers in West Germany were closed; and the few communist members of parliament in the West German puppet government were also dismissed. Harmut pointed out the situation in which the American and British occupiers are actively preparing for war in West Germany: a large number of war criminals sentenced by the Nuremberg Military Tribunal have been released. For example, Dietrich, a confidant of fascist Hitler, has been released; the commander of the mercenary army established by American imperialism in West Germany is Manstein, the army marshal when Hitler attacked the Soviet Union. These many vicious conspiracies of the American and British occupiers cannot frighten the German people. The anti-imperialist movement in West Germany is growing day by day. The German people are fighting hard, for the struggle to defend peace and strive for unity. There will be a general election throughout Germany in October. This general election is not for party competition, but to consolidate the strength of the German Democratic Republic and the unity of Germany. (Attached picture)

　　为和平、统一而战斗的德国青年
    ——德国青年代表哈尔默特访问记
    德国青年代表、自由德国青年联盟中央委员会委员哈尔默特和记者谈到他对新中国的印象时兴奋地说：这次访问中国最使他感到兴奋和愉快的是看到了中国一年来建设工作伟大的成就。哈尔默特说，德国青年对毛泽东主席有着崇高的敬爱。在德国，许多优秀的青年工作组织，都用了毛泽东的名字作为称号。中国人民把美英帝国主义赶了出去，对德国自由和统一是有很大帮助的。哈尔默特着重地指出，中国青年在保卫世界和平所作的努力和成就，使德国青年感到无限的兴奋。他在访问新中国时见到中国青年参加祖国建设工作所表现的劳动热情，学习热情和国际主义精神，都给德国青年以无限的鼓舞。因此，他深信，中德人民和青年的友谊，是会一天天增长的。
    记者询及德国青年争取自由、统一和保卫世界和平的情况时，哈尔默特简单地介绍了自由德国青年联盟的组织及其工作。他并指出，德国青年争取统一、保卫和平运动，是由青年联盟来领导的。自由德国青年联盟现有盟员二百余万人。占德意志民主共和国青年百分之五十三。今年底要发展到共和国青年百分之七十五都参加联盟。青年联盟的盟员把苏联列宁共产主义青年团作为学习的榜样；并也向中国青年学习到不少的经验。他们的口号是“每一个德国青年都是勇敢的、积极的和平战士！每一个青年都要保卫和平！”今年五月间全德青年大会以后，斯大林给他们一个祝贺的电报，给他们极大的鼓励。他们发动了各种工作竞赛，来答谢斯大林的期望。在这一段时间，德国青年征集和平签名的人数达八百万人，占全德参加和平签名人数百分之四十七。截至八月十二日止。德意志民主共和国青年在工厂、企业、村庄、机关里组织的保卫世界和平机构有一万三千七百八十四个单位，他们并组织了二万八千六百三十二个和平运动宣传小组，进行宣传工作。此外，还组织了一万六千九百三十八个劳动突击队，为完成新五年计划作准备工作。这些突击队的任务是要完成生产计划、提高产品质量和节省材料。他们在各工厂成立了六千一百零八个业务小组，有六万二千九百七十六人加强业务技术的学习。今年收获季节，有青年四十九万二千九百八十四人帮助农民收割。青年联盟盟员为了加强理论思想教育，都学习《皮克总统传》、《斯大林传略》和《联共党史》。今年参加争取学习优异奖章的盟员有属于一万二千九百五十二个小组的十八万三千二百三十五人。
    在西德，也有青年联盟的组织，不顾西德占领者的极端压制，他们积极地工作。如在汉堡就有青年联盟盟员一万二千余人，积极展开保卫和平的宣传工作。九月三十日到十月一日在鲁尔区多特蒙德将举行的西德十万青年保卫和平大会和青年和平战士代表大会，虽然已遭西德的占领者所禁止，但这个会一定会胜利地举行的。德国青年决不甘心使德国分裂，决不作帝国主义的炮灰。假如帝国主义敢于挑起战争，德国青年毫无疑问要站在和平阵营一方面，有决心击败帝国主义的进攻。
    哈尔默特告诉记者说，德国今天的成就，假如没有苏联的帮助是不可能的。苏联自打败了法西斯希特勒的进攻以后，完全遵守波茨坦协定来对待德国。在德国首先实行了土地改革，把法西斯战犯的土地没收，凡地主超过一百公顷的土地都收为国有，分配给贫穷的农民。在工厂方面，法西斯战犯的工厂、煤矿、铁路和银行都收归国有。由于这些改革，统一社会党才有条件提出了两年计划。这个计划由于德国人民和青年的热情工作，已于七月底提前完成了。哈尔默特指出，这个计划的完成，苏联和东欧人民民主国家曾给许多帮助。
    去年德国青年为斯大林祝寿签名的人数，达到共和国青年百分之七十。
    哈尔默特说，在西德美英法占领区，西德人民生活显著地恶化，由于马歇尔计划的影响，德国消费品工业都被挤垮了。现在西德有四百万人失业。和平运动在西德也受到压制。哈尔默特出国以前，西德所有共产党的报纸都被封闭；在西德傀儡政府议会中的几位共产党议员也被撤职。哈尔默特指出，美英占领者在西德积极准备战争的情形：大批被纽伦堡军事法庭判刑的战犯都被释放。如法西斯希特勒的亲信蒂特里赫就被释放了；美帝国主义在西德成立的雇佣军，其主持者就是希特勒进攻苏联时的陆军元帅曼斯丁。美，英占领者这许多毒恶的阴谋，并不能吓倒德国人民。西德的反帝运动正一天天地增长着。德国人民正在坚强战斗，为了保卫和平、为了争取统一的斗争，全德将在十月间普选。这次普选，不是为了党派的竞争，而是为了巩固德意志民主共和国的力量和全德的统一。（附图片）
