World Federation of Democratic Youth Representative Interview Notes

Canadian People Rejoice at the Victory of the Chinese People
Interview with Canadian Representative Whamsley
    The reporter met with Whamsley, a representative of the democratic youth of Canada. He first declared to the reporter: He is a member of a youth branch committee of the Canadian Peace Congress, and he represents the people of Canada, especially the youth of Canada, who are fighting for peace, to pay tribute to the Chinese people.

    When he talked about the struggle of progressive Canadian youth for peace, he said: "Progressive Canadian youth have united in many progressive youth organizations such as the Ukrainian Youth League, the Hebrew Youth Association, the Hungarian Youth League, and Russian Youth League and other cultural groups, and some young people have also joined trade unions. The Canadian Peace Congress has united many progressive youths."

    When the reporter asked about the situation of the Labor Youth League of Canada, Whamsley said: "The National Labor Youth League represents a part of the progressive youth of Canada and is a united front organization. Its purpose is to unite all the labor youth of Canada to fight for reasonable wages and welfare for young workers and to defend world peace. The General Secretary of the National Labor Youth League is Norman Penner. In the five major cities of Canada, there are organizations of the National Labor Youth League."

    He described the domestic struggle of progressive Canadian youth: "The Labor Youth League has actively participated in the strike of the Seafarers' Union. In May last year, the Labor Youth League participated in a peaceful gathering, which was held on the border between Canada and the United States, with three thousand progressive youths from Canada and the United States participating in the conference. In the conference, they jointly demonstrated for peace. In the same month, the Second Canadian Peace Congress was held in Toronto, Canada's second largest city, with three hundred youth representatives. Many of them were members of the Labor Youth League. In the past two peace conferences, the Labor Youth League had mobilized many of its members to fight for peace." He particularly pointed out the increasing strength of Canadian youth in the peace struggle: "The number of these three hundred representatives has exceeded ten times the number of youth representatives in the first peace conference. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the youth of Canada, under the leadership of the youth branch committee of their peace congress, decided to hold a national mass protest conference in September in the Canadian capital. In September, the Canadian Parliament will also be in session, and they will also protest to Canadian Prime Minister Laurent, protesting against his mobilization of five thousand Canadian troops to Korea to help the American imperialist aggression."

    Whamsley mentioned the struggle of Canadian students for peace: "In 1948, Canadian students began to pay attention to peace. At that time, there was a student peace congress organization in the University of Toronto. Now there are student peace congress organizations in six universities. This Christmas, students will hold a national peace conference. In this conference, they will discuss and adopt resolutions to consolidate their determination to defend peace and to condemn the American imperialist aggression against Korea and Taiwan."

    When he talked about the development of the Canadian peace movement, he said: "In the summer of 1949, the first organization in Canada to defend peace - the Toronto Youth Peace Congress - was established. In January 1950, a youth peace alliance was organized in Montreal, a major city in Canada, with 33 different youth groups participating. This proves how extensive the peace movement of Canadian youth is."

    Whamsley cited an example: "A debate was held at the University of Toronto on the topic of 'War is Inevitable'. During the debate, although the people who affirmed this question were very important military figures, as a result of the debate, the people who negated this question - that is, 'War is Avoidable' - gained the support of the majority and won the victory."

    "Progressive Canadian youth are very determined to oppose the American imperialists' aggression against Korea." When talking about the views of Canadian youth on the American imperialist aggression against Korea, Whamsley firmly said, "The American imperialist aggression against Korea has been widely opposed by the progressive people of Canada!" To prove this point, he cited an example: "In Quebec, most of the newspapers have taken a position against the Canadian government's dispatch of troops to Korea. This fact is significant because this province is one of the most reactionary provinces in Canada."

    When he talked about what the Canadian people know about New China, he said: "It is very difficult for the Canadian people to know the situation in New China, because Canadian newspapers consistently distort the facts. But the Canadian people are relatively fortunate, because they have a powerful leader of the peace congress, James Endicott." When he asked the reporter if he knew this powerful peace activist, he smiled and said, "He was born in China. He exposed the shameless rumors of the newspapers controlled by the American government and the Canadian government, because he is very familiar with the situation in China, and he used facts to expose the lies of the reactionary newspapers. Because of his exposure, many Canadians and young people began to see the true face of American aggression in the Far East and the essence of imperialism. Progressive Canadian youth clearly know that China's revolution is of great significance to the cause of world people's struggle for lasting peace and people's democracy. They rejoice at the victory of the Chinese people, and they know that this victory is a very great victory in the struggle of the world's people. This victory has helped the Canadian people in their struggle for their own happiness." He continued: "Progressive Canadian youth and the people solemnly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's demand that China should have representatives to participate in the United Nations and the Security Council. They also demand that American imperialism stop the war of aggression against Korea."

    When the reporter asked Whamsley to talk about his impressions of visiting Northeast China, he said: "I am deeply moved by the achievements of the Chinese people in rebuilding their cities - these cities have been destroyed by Japanese imperialists and the Kuomintang. I am fully convinced that the Chinese people will surely achieve complete victory in the cause of building the future happiness of their own country!" (with picture)

专栏：世界青联代表访问记

　　加拿大人民为中国人民的胜利欢欣
    访加拿大代表华姆斯雷
    记者会见了加拿大民主青年代表华姆斯雷。他首先向记者声明：他是加拿大和平大会中的一个青年分支委员会的一员，他代表着为和平而斗争的加拿大的人民，特别是加拿大的青年，向中国人民致敬。
    他谈到加拿大的进步青年为和平而斗争时说：“ 加拿大进步青年已团结在许多进步的青年组织像乌克兰青年团、希伯莱青年协会、匈牙利青年团、俄罗斯青年团等文化团体中，也有一些青年参加了工会。加拿大和平大会团结了很多进步青年。”
    当记者问到加拿大劳动青年联盟的情况时，华姆斯雷说：“全国劳动青年联盟代表了加拿大进步青年的一部分，是一个统一战线的组织。它的目的是为了联合加拿大的一切劳动青年以争取劳动青年的合理工资与青年工人福利并保卫全世界的和平。全国劳动青年联盟的总书记是诺曼·盘诺（NormanPenner)。在加拿大的五个大城市中，都有全国劳动青年联盟的组织。”
    他对加拿大进步青年在国内的斗争情况叙述道：“劳动青年联盟曾积极地参加了海员工会的罢工。去年五月，劳动青联会参加了和平的集会，这个会是在加拿大与美国的边境地方举行的，大会中有三千个加拿大及美国的进步青年参加。在大会中他们共同地为和平而示威。同月在加拿大第二大城市大兰多举行了第二次加拿大和平大会，其中有三百个青年的代表。其中有许多是劳动青联的盟员。劳动青联在过去的两次和平大会中，都曾动员了许多劳动青联盟员来为和平斗争。”他对加拿大青年在和平斗争中力量的增强，特别指出说：“这三百个代表的数字已超过了第一次和平大会的青年代表的十倍。在朝鲜战事爆发后，加拿大的青年在他们的和平大会的青年分支委员会领导之下，决定于九月在加拿大首都举行一个全国性的群众性的抗议大会。在九月时，加拿大国会也要开会了，他们并将向加拿大的政府总理劳兰特提出抗议，抗议他动员五千个加拿大军队到朝鲜帮助美帝的侵略。”
    华姆斯雷提到加拿大学生在为和平而斗争时说：“在一九四八年，加拿大的学生就开始对和平关心。那时大兰多大学里面就有学生和平大会的组织。现在六个大学里面已有了学生和平大会的组织。在今年的圣诞节，学生将要举行一个全国性的和平大会。在这个大会中，将要讨论并采取决议来巩固他们为了保卫和平的决心，并指斥美帝国主义的侵略朝鲜及台湾。”
    当他谈到加拿大和平运动的开展时，他说：“一九四九年夏天，加拿大青年的第一个保卫和平的组织——大兰多青年和平大会成立了。一九五○年一月，在加拿大大城市蒙特利尔中组织了一个青年和平联盟，这个组织有三十三个不同的青年团体参加了。这就可证明加拿大青年的和平的运动是多么广泛。”
    华姆斯雷举例说：“在大兰多大学里面曾举行了一个辩论会，题目是‘战争是不可以避免的’，在辩论当中，站在肯定这个问题方面的人们虽然是很重要的军事方面的人物，但是辩论的结果，站在否定这个问题——就是‘战争是可以避免的’——的人们，得到了大多数的拥护而获得胜利。”
    “加拿大的进步青年非常坚决地反对美国帝国主义者侵略朝鲜”，当谈到加拿大青年对美帝侵略朝鲜的看法时，华姆斯雷坚决地说：“美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略，遭到加拿大进步人民广泛的反对！”他为了证明这一点，举了一个例子：“就是在奎比克省，大多数的报纸都采取了反对加拿大政府派军队到朝鲜的行为。这样的事实是有意义的，因为这个省是加拿大各省中最反动的一个。”
    当他谈到加拿大人民对新中国有什么认识时，他说：“加拿大的人民是很难得知道新中国的情形的，因为加拿大的报纸一贯地歪曲事实。但是加拿大人民还比较幸运，因为他们有一个有力的和平大会的领袖文幼章。”当他询问记者是否知道这个有力的和平运动者后，笑着说：“他是在中国出生的。他揭露了被美国政府与加拿大政府所操纵的报纸的无耻造谣，因为他对于中国的情形很熟悉，他用事实拆穿了反动报纸的谎言。由于他的揭露，许多加拿大的人民与青年开始看到了美国侵略远东的真面目与帝国主义的本质。加拿大的进步青年很清楚地知道：中国的革命对世界人民的争取持久和平与人民民主的事业是有很大的意义。他们为中国人民的胜利欢欣，他们知道这个胜利是世界人民斗争的一个非常伟大的胜利。这胜利帮助了加拿大人民为自己的幸福所作的斗争。”他继续说道：“加拿大的进步青年与人民郑重地支持中国周外长的要求——中国应有代表参加联合国与安全理事会。他们并要求美帝国主义停止侵略朝鲜的战争。”
    当记者请华姆斯雷谈谈参观东北的感想时，他说：“我深深地被中国人民重建他们的城市——这些城市曾遭受到日本帝国主义者及国民党的破坏——的成绩所感动。我充分相信中国人民在建设自己国家的将来幸福的事业其中必然得到完全的胜利！”（附图片）
