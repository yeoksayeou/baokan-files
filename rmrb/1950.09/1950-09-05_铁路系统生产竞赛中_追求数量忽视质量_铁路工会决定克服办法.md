　　Railway System Production Competition:
    Pursuing Quantity, Neglecting Quality
    Railway Union Decides on Remedial Measures
    (Xinhua News Agency, 4th) Regarding the question of how trade unions can correctly organize production competitions, the All-China Railway Workers' Union held its first enlarged standing committee meeting in August and conducted discussions. The main deviations that occurred in the past when local railway unions led production competition movements were: in production, only pursuing quantity and neglecting quality; treating production competitions as shock work; but not paying enough attention to workers' labor protection, safety, hygiene and other welfare matters, thus seriously damaging the health of workers. For example, in the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory's production competition, over 29,000 work hours were volunteered in June; in the Northeast Railway Zone in June, due to working overtime and failing to pay sufficient attention to safety and hygiene, a total of 130,000 employees (excluding the China Changchun Railway) accumulated 80,000 workdays of sick leave for the month, equivalent to 3,000 workers not working for an entire month. The main reason for these shortcomings is that local trade unions did not treat organizing production competitions as regular work, but as temporary shock tasks; they did not purposefully use competitions to solve the most important problems in the current work, but blindly pursued quantity. Furthermore, the railway union regional committees and the national committee did not regularly understand the situation and inspect lower-level work, which prevented the aforementioned shortcomings from being corrected promptly.
    In order to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, the All-China Railway Workers' Union's first enlarged standing committee meeting has decided that in the future, trade unions at all levels must overcome blindness in production, mobilize workers and staff to assist administrative heads at all levels in formulating appropriate production plans and production quotas, strive to enter into collective contracts with the administrative side, clearly delineate the responsibilities of the administration and the trade union; organize production competitions while strictly preventing the deviations of working overtime and neglecting quality, in order to ensure the completion of production tasks. At the same time, it is necessary to conscientiously improve various labor conditions and truly do a good job in the safety and hygiene of employees in production. In order to implement the above tasks, the meeting also decided that trade unions at all levels should universally carry out organizational and ideological rectification work within the trade union.

　　铁路系统生产竞赛中
    追求数量忽视质量           
    铁路工会决定克服办法
    【新华社四日讯】关于工会如何正确地组织生产竞赛的问题，中国铁路工会八月中召集的第一次扩大常委会议曾进行了讨论。各地铁路工会过去在领导生产竞赛运动时发生的主要偏向是：在生产中只追求数量而忽视质量，把生产竞赛当作突击工作，但对工人的劳动保护、安全卫生等福利事项又没有很好地注意，因而严重地损害了工人健康。如石家庄铁路工厂在生产竞赛中，六月份义务加工达两万九千多工时；东北区铁路六月份由于加点加班及没有很好注意安全卫生工作，结果全路职工十三万人（不包括中长铁路）全月就有八万工日的伤病假，等于三千个工人一个月不做工。产生这些缺点的主要原因就是各地工会不是把组织生产竞赛当作经常的工作，而是当作临时突击任务；不是有目的地通过竞赛解决当前工作中的最主要问题，而是盲目地追求数量。而铁路工会各区委员会和全国委员会没有经常地了解情况和检查下层工作，也使上述缺点没有能及早纠正。
    为克服上述缺点，铁路工会全国委员会第一次常委扩大会议已决定今后各级工会必须克服生产中的盲目性，发动工人和职员协助各级行政负责人制订适当的生产计划和生产定额，争取与行政方面订立集体合同，明确划分行政与工会的职责；在严格防止加班加点与忽视质量的偏向中，组织生产竞赛，以保证生产任务的完成。同时，必须认真改进各种劳动条件，确实做好生产中职工的安全卫生工作。为了贯彻以上各项工作，会议还决定各级工会普遍在工会内部展开整顿组织和思想作风的工作。
