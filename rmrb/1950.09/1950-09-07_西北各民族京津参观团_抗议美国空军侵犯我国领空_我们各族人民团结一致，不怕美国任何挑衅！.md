　　Northwest Ethnic Groups' Beijing-Tianjin Visiting Group
    Protests U.S. Air Force Intrusion into Our Airspace 
    We, all Ethnic Groups, are United and Fear No Provocation from the U.S.!
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The news that American planes twice intruded into our Northeast airspace, killing and wounding our compatriots, immediately aroused great anger among members of various ethnic groups in the Northwest Ethnic Groups' Visiting Group, who recently came to visit Beijing and Tianjin. In various languages, they expressed the same sentiment: resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn protest to the United States; and expressed that all ethnic groups must be more firmly united around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and fight to the end to defeat the American aggressors.
    Ma Fuchen, a Hui elder with a white beard and over seventy years old, began by excitedly talking about the great peaceful construction endeavors of the new China. He felt honored to be able to witness these things firsthand. The new things at the new farm implement factory and the collective farm aroused his great interest, filling him with confidence in the bright future of the new China. When the topic turned to the aggressive crimes of American imperialism, he said, "After the American imperialist aggressor troops in Korea suffered repeated defeats, they continuously and indiscriminately bombed peaceful residents of Korea, and recently even intruded into our sacred airspace, killing and wounding our compatriots. This is nothing but a demonstration of the American imperialists' aggression, so frantic that they disregard the unanimous condemnation of the people of the world, completely exposing their true face of aggression. The various ethnic groups in the Northwest, like all peace-loving people of the world, express unparalleled hatred!"
    Ahat, a young Uyghur worker, recalled the tragic situation when American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang ruled Xinjiang, whenever American imperialism's crimes were mentioned. He said, "They didn't take us minority ethnic groups seriously at all, and even less so our workers." He said, "We have suffered enough discrimination and persecution, and now whenever I think of American imperialism, my heart ignites with anger." Now, when he heard that American imperialism was again viciously massacring our compatriots, his anger reached its peak. He expressed that after returning, he would redouble his efforts in production to support the People's Liberation Army, complete the arduous task of liberating Taiwan and Tibet, and express their protest through direct action.
    "Sooner or later, we will completely expel American imperialism. In the near future, we will definitely organize a Taiwan visiting group to visit Taiwan," enthusiastically added Habidula, a young Kazakh worker.
    Airedin, a Mongolian who lived a nomadic life for a long time in the Xinjiang region, said in a firm tone, "We will definitely make American imperialism repay the blood debt owed to the Chinese people with blood. The people of all ethnic groups in our country are peace-loving, but we are also not afraid of any war. American imperialism boasts about its airplanes and atomic bombs, but this will never scare us. The people of all ethnic groups in China have become a united, loving, and mutually supportive big family, and we are not afraid of any provocative behavior!"
    Huang Zhengqing of the Tibetan ethnicity began his speech by especially praising the heroic fighting behavior of the Korean People's Army. He said that after listening to the speeches of the Chinese People's Delegation that visited Korea and watching the films of the Korean people's fighting, the heroic behavior of the Korean people rising up to fight to defend their motherland and the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Liberation Army equally moved them. He said, "The affairs of each country should be managed by the people of that country themselves, which has nothing to do with American imperialism. Peace-loving people of all ethnic groups should unite strongly to defend peace!"
    Ma Quanliang of the Dongxiang ethnicity and Qi Changlian of the Tu ethnicity in Qinghai spoke about the "peace" and "friendship" with the Chinese people that the United States claimed. Ma Quanliang said, "American imperialism also hypocritically calls for 'peace,' which is a complete lie. The atrocities of American planes and the acts of aggression in Korea and Taiwan completely expose their lies." Qi Changlian said, "The repeated blood debts that American imperialism owes to the Chinese people are the 'friendship with the Chinese people' that American imperialism speaks of. The Chinese people have had enough of this 'friendship,' and we resolutely do not want this kind of 'friendship.' Now, in addition to mourning the dead compatriots, we must unite to avenge the dead compatriots!" (Zhang Shikai)

　　西北各民族京津参观团
    抗议美国空军侵犯我国领空 
    我们各族人民团结一致，不怕美国任何挑衅！
    【本报讯】美国飞机两次侵入我东北领空、杀伤我国同胞的消息传来后，立刻激起了最近前来京、津一带参观的西北各民族参观团各民族人士极大的愤怒。他们以各种不同的语言，表达了相同的意念：坚决拥护周外长向美国所提出的严正的抗议；并表示各族人民必须更坚固地团结在共产党、毛主席的周围，为打败美国侵略者而奋斗到底。
    回族的马辅臣，是一位胡须斑白、年已七十多的老先生。他开头兴奋地畅谈着新中国各项伟大的和平建设事业，他以能够亲眼看到这些而感到光荣。新农具制造厂和集体农场的新鲜事物，引起了他莫大的兴味，使他对新中国的光明的前途充满了信心。当话题转到了美帝国主义的侵略暴行时，他说：“美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略军节节败退以后，就接连地滥炸着朝鲜的和平居民，最近竟又侵入我国神圣的领空，杀伤我祖国同胞，这不是别的，仅仅只说明了美帝国主义的侵略暴行，疯狂到已不顾全世界人民的同声指责，完全暴露了他的侵略的真面目。西北各民族，如同全世界爱好和平的各族人民一样，表示无比的愤恨！”
    维吾尔族的青年工人阿哈提，一提到美帝国主义的罪行，就回想起过去美帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪帮统治着新疆时的悲惨情形。他说：“他们根本不把我们少数民族放在眼里，对我们工人更是不用说了。”他说：“我们已经受够了歧视和迫害，现在每当想起了美帝国主义，心中就发火。”现在，当他听到了美帝国主义又凶恶地残杀我国同胞，他的愤怒到达了极点。他表示：回去以后要加倍努力地生产，支援人民解放军，完成解放台湾与西藏的艰巨任务，用直接行动来表示他们的抗议。
    “美帝国主义迟早会给我们完全驱逐出境，不久将来我们一定要组织一个台湾参观团，到台湾去参观。”哈萨克族青年工人哈必都拉也热情地插上了一句。
    在新疆地区过着长期游牧生活的蒙族人艾日丁用坚定的口吻说道：“美帝国主义历次给我们中国人民欠下的血债，我们一定要他用血来偿还。我们国家的各族人民都是爱好和平的，但我们也决不怕任何战争。美帝国主义夸耀着他的飞机，夸耀着他的原子弹，但这决吓不了我们。中国各族人民已经成为一个团结、友爱、互助的大家庭，任何挑衅行为，我们都不怕！”
    藏族的黄正清一开始谈话，就特别赞扬朝鲜人民军的英勇战斗行为。他说，他们听了访问朝鲜的中国人民代表团的谈话，看了朝鲜人民战斗的电影，朝鲜人民为捍卫祖国而奋起作战的英勇行为和中国人民解放军的英勇事迹同样地感动了他们。他说：“各国的事情，由各国人民自己来管，这跟美帝国主义毫无关系。爱好和平的各民族人民应该坚强地团结起来，保卫和平！”
    东乡族的马全良与青海土族的祁昌连说到了美帝所说的“和平”与对中国人民的“友谊”，马全良说：“美帝国主义也假惺惺地叫什么‘和平’，完全是说谎。美国飞机的暴行和在朝鲜、台湾的侵略行为就把他们的谎话完全暴露了。”祁昌连说：“美帝对我们中国人民欠下的一次又一次的血债，就是美帝所说的‘对中国人民的友谊’，这种‘友谊’，中国人民领教够了，我们坚决不要这种‘友谊’。现在我们除哀悼死难同胞外，必须团结起来为死难同胞报仇！”（张世楷）
