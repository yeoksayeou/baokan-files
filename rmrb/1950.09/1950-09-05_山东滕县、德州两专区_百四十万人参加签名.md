Shandong Teng County and Dezhou Special Districts
1.4 Million People Participate in Signing
[By Our Newspaper] The peace signature campaign in Teng County and Dezhou Special Districts, Shandong, is currently being promoted in the rural areas to the broad masses. Before the work began, cadres of various agencies held meetings of various forms to discuss the current international situation, study various documents related to the movement to defend peace, and learn about propaganda points and methods. Then, with workers, peasants, youth, and women from various counties and districts as the main force, peace signature committees were organized. In conjunction with the movement to oppose American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, extensive propaganda was carried out to the masses through lectures, discussions, cartoons, and maps to raise the political awareness of the masses. For example, Yu Xiuzhi, a woman from Liuli Well in Pei County, said: "Signing in support of peace will allow us ordinary people to live a stable life. We must unite, work harder, and all sign so that American imperialism can see the strength of us Chinese people." After a current affairs discussion at the village cadre meeting in the Sixth District, everyone understood the significance of the peace signature campaign and unanimously agreed that the United States is a major bully in the world, and the people of all countries in the world uniting will definitely be able to stop its hegemonic acts of aggression. Zhang, an old man of seventy-three from Juji Village, Linhe District, Jiyang County, said: "The Communist Party came and gave me land. I should work hard, harvest more grain, and I must support peace so that everyone can live a stable life." Wang Qingyun from Wang Guquan Village, Qingyun, said: "To live a peaceful life, we must unite. My family of ten has all signed, so that American imperialism can see our strength in opposing it." Militiamen, women, and military dependents in Mazhuang, Caocun District, Dexian County, held separate symposiums in various departments and launched extensive signature campaigns among relatives and friends. As a result, three-quarters of the people in the entire village signed the peace declaration. According to preliminary statistics so far, the number of signatures in Teng County Special District has reached 1.09 million, and the number of signatures in Dezhou Special District has reached more than 356,000.

　　山东滕县、德州两专区
    百四十万人参加签名
    【本报讯】滕县、德州两专区的和平签名运动现正深入各农村向广大群众展开宣传。在工作展开之前，各机关干部，举行各种不同形式的会议，讨论目前国际形势，学习各种有关保卫和平运动的各种文件和宣传要点与方法。然后以各县区工、农、青年、妇女为主，组织保卫和平签名委员会，再结合反对美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜运动，通过讲演、讨论、漫画和地图各种形式向群众作广泛宣传，提高群众的政治认识。如沛县六里井妇女于岫芝说：“签名拥护和平咱老百姓就能过安稳日子，咱们要团结好，多做活，都签名，叫美帝国主义看看咱们中国人的力量。”六区村干会上经过时事座谈后，大家明白了和平签名的意义，一致认为美国是世界上的一个大恶霸，全世界各国人民团结起来一定能制止它的霸道侵略行为。济阳县临河区鞠家村七十三岁的张老大爷说：“共产党来了给我分得了土地，正应该好好干活，多收粮食，我一定要拥护和平，让大家都能过上安稳日子。”庆云王古全村王清云说：“要过太平日子只有团结起来，我家十口人全都签了名，叫美帝国主义看看咱们反对它的力量吧。”德县曹村区马庄的民兵、妇女和军属都分别召开了各部门的座谈会，纷纷向亲友发动广泛的签名运动后，全村四分之三的人都在和平宣言上签了名。截至目前的初步统计，滕县专区的签名人数已达一百零九万，德州专区签名人数亦达三十五万六千余人。
