　　The Huolu County Party Committee Examines Key Work
    Complacency and Neglecting Production Leadership Are Serious Obstacles in the County's Work.
    [Report from our newspaper] Our newspaper's special correspondent, Hou Yong, reports: The Huolu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hebei Province, has examined its key work over the past six months after reading documents during the rectification movement. In the past six months, Huolu County has achieved considerable success in building political power and leading production: people's representative conferences at the county, district, and village levels were convened, and people's governments at the county, district, and village levels were elected, strengthening the ties between the Party and the government and the masses. Production policies were implemented, cotton planting exceeded the plan, and various disasters were eliminated. The County Committee leadership has also initially overcome the all-encompassing leadership method of the Party acting as the government. However, there are still several serious problems in various aspects of the work:

    First, the leadership's thinking cannot keep up with the needs of the situation, mainly manifested in the inability to lead economic construction work. The County Committee leadership often busies itself with rushing to complete other tasks while neglecting the leadership of production work, and there is the erroneous thinking that "it doesn't matter if production is not taken care of, but other work must be completed." This does not conform to the principle of using 90 percent of our strength to give things to the masses and 10 percent of our strength to ask things from the masses. In leading agricultural production, first of all, there is insufficient understanding of the farmers' ideological situation. After land reform, although most farmers value land certificates, some farmers do not pay enough attention to them; some farmers have grain stored and are unwilling to buy land, fearing that "socialism will be implemented again in five years." This hinders production development. These phenomena were not discovered until this review. Secondly, there is insufficient regular organization to realize production plans, often relying on rush campaigns. The central link in leading production is organizing mutual aid. Although higher-level instructions and documents repeatedly emphasize organization, we only emphasize organizing mutual aid at meetings, lacking practical work. Therefore, production leadership appears empty and weak.

    Regarding urban work, higher authorities have repeatedly emphasized developing industry and commerce, organizing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and using cities to lead the countryside. However, because we still have blind rural viewpoints, we rarely study industrial and commercial policies, urban work, cooperatives, and other work. We don't like to listen to merchants, and we consider all the problems they reflect as resistance to taxation, unwilling to consider and study them carefully, which affects our understanding of industry and commerce and our unity with merchants. Due to the lack of leadership in commerce, abnormal phenomena such as excessively light or heavy taxation, a decrease in established merchants, and an increase in peddlers have occurred.

    Second, there is a serious bureaucratic work style in the leadership. The County Committee leadership lacks sufficient investigation and research and an accurate analysis of the situation. For example, in this year's production increase plan, it was proposed that "irrigated land should increase by two *shi* of grain, and dry land should increase by one *shi* of grain." However, this requirement has no scientific basis, so it is naturally difficult to achieve. The same is true in election work. At that time, spring plowing was beginning, the assessment of production had not yet been completed, and many cadres had gone home for the New Year and had not yet returned to their posts. The County Committee leadership deployed the work based only on subjective wishes, which fueled the commandist style. Individual villages even posted sentries to complete the election task. After the election, no one went to check the work of some villages for a long time.

    Third, the County Committee's leadership method lacks systematic and in-depth inspection, and it is satisfied with general reports. Therefore, many problems are discovered only after they have been occurring for a considerable period. Problems that have been discovered are often delayed and cannot be dealt with in a timely manner. In particular, major issues related to the masses' lives are not checked and resolved in a timely manner, which greatly affects the masses' lives and production. For example, this spring, the supply and marketing cooperative reported that the more than 400,000 *jin* of cottonseed they had stored had a germination rate of 80 percent, and some said it was 90 percent. In fact, after they were distributed to the masses for sowing, some had a germination rate of only 40 percent, and some only 20 percent. In addition, due to insufficient technical guidance, many cotton seedlings were destroyed. This has seriously harmed the interests of the people.

    The main reasons for these errors are: Since last spring, the work of Huolu County has always been considered good by the leadership. In particular, the convening of the People's Representative Conference this spring, which moved the work forward, has seriously increased the complacency of the leadership and cadres, making it impossible for everyone to carefully study the instructions of higher authorities, let alone humbly learn from other counties and listen to the opinions of the masses; blind complacency has resulted in a dull sense of fresh things, and carelessness in work. Secondly, the County Committee leadership has relaxed the study of theoretical policies, and there is a tendency towards empiricism in the way of thinking, lacking a set of scientific systems suitable for today's work, while still retaining serious guerrilla habits.

### 获鹿县委检查主要工作  骄傲自满，忽视生产领导，是该县工作中的严重障碍。

　　获鹿县委检查主要工作
    骄傲自满，忽视生产领导，是该县工作中的严重障碍。
    【本报讯】本报特约通讯员侯永报道：中共河北省获鹿县委会，在整风运动中经过阅读文件，检查了半年来的主要工作。半年来获鹿县在建政与领导生产工作上都获得了相当大的成绩：召开了县、区、村三级人民代表大会，选举了县、区、村三级人民政府，密切了党和政府与群众的联系。贯彻了生产政策，种棉超过了计划，消灭了各种灾害。县委领导上并初步克服了以党代政的一揽子领导方法。但在各项工作中还存在着若干严重问题：
    第一、领导思想赶不上形势的需要，主要表现在不善于领导经济建设工作。县委领导上往往忙于突击其他工作而放松了对生产工作的领导，并存在着“生产不管不要紧，其他工作不管完不成”的错误思想。这就不符合于以百分之九十的力量给群众东西，百分之十的力量向群众要东西的原则。这样在领导农业生产方面，首先了解农民思想情况不够。在土地改革后，虽然一般农民重视土地证，但有部分农民却不够重视；有的农民存有粮食不愿买地，怕“再等五年实行社会主义”。以致阻碍了生产发展。这些现象直到这次检查中才被发现。其次对经常的组织实现生产计划不够，往往是用突击的方式进行。领导生产的中心一环是组织互助，虽然上级指示和文件中再三强调组织起来，但我们对组织互助只是在会议上强调一下，而缺少实际工作。因而生产领导上显得空洞无力。
    对城市工作，上级一再强调发展工商业，组织城乡物资交流，以城市领导农村。但因我们还存在着盲目的农村观点，就很少研究工商业政策，城镇工作，合作社等工作。对商人的话不喜欢听，对商人所反映的问题一律认为是对抗税收，不愿很好的考虑与研究，以致影响了自己对工商业的了解，与商人的团结。由于对商业缺乏领导，造成税收中的畸轻畸重、座商减少、摊贩增多等不正常现象。
    第二、领导上存在着严重的官僚主义作风。县委领导工作中缺乏充分调查研究及对情况的确切分析。例如在今年的增产计划中提出：“水地增加二市斗，旱地增加一市斗”。但是这个要求并无科学根据，结果自然很难实现。在选举工作上也是如此，当时正值春耕开始，评定产量尚未完成，并有不少干部回家过年尚未回到工作岗位，县委领导上只凭主观愿望布置下去，结果助长了强迫命令作风。个别村庄为了完成选举任务竟站岗放哨。选举后有些村庄的工作又长期没人去检查。
    第三、县委的领导方法中缺乏系统深入的检查，而满足于一般报告。因此有很多问题在发生相当时间后才被发现。已被发现的问题，也常被拖延下去不能及时处理。特别是关系群众生活的一些重大问题不能及时检查解决，使群众生活、生产受到很大影响。例如今春供销社报告说，他们保存的四十余万斤棉籽，发芽率在百分之八十，有的说在百分之九十。实际上发到群众手中播种后，一部分发芽率仅只百分之四十，还有一部分只百分之二十。加上技术指导不够，棉苗被毁的很多。这就严重地损害了人民的利益。
    产生这些错误的主要原因是：获鹿县的工作，自去春以来，一直被领导上认为是不错的。特别是今春召开了人民代表大会，工作向前推进了一步，严重地增长了领导上及干部的骄傲自满情绪，使大家不能细心的研究上级指示，更不能虚心地向其他县份学习，和倾听群众意见；盲目自满，结果对新鲜事物的感觉迟钝，工作上粗枝大叶。其次，县委领导上放松了对理论政策的学习，思想方法上存在着经验主义偏向，缺乏一套科学的适合今天工作的制度，而仍保留着严重的游击习气。
