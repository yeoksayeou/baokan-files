　　Rescuing the Substation
    Dalian Mechanical Factory Wang Fusheng
    On the night of July 13th, Wang Bingjian, a lathe worker at the Dalian Mechanical Factory, was getting a haircut at the barber shop when suddenly thunder roared and it started to rain heavily. Wang Bingjian's heart jumped. He remembered that the factory doors were not closed, and if rainwater got in, the factory would suffer losses. There was a hole under the door of the substation in the lathe workshop, making it easy for water to get in. If the lead pipes covering the wires were soaked, there would be a short circuit. Over time, if the lead pipes covering the wires touched each other, or if water got into the electric cylinder, it would catch fire. After finishing his haircut, he rushed out without even washing his hair. When he arrived at the dormitory, it was already past 9:30 PM. Lian Zuokuan and Han Lianfa, who lived with him, were about to go to bed. Wang Bingjian said breathlessly, "It's bad! It's raining so hard outside, and the factory gates aren't closed. A lot of water must have gotten in! Let's go take a look together." The three of them went straight to the factory. The ground was muddy, and the road was uneven, making it easy to get their feet stuck in the mud. But the three of them ran to the factory as if flying.
    Comrade Wang from the security department was standing at the window, anxiously watching the rain getting heavier and heavier outside. Wang Bingjian and the other two walked in and said to Comrade Wang, "The factory might be flooded, let's quickly find a way to block it." Comrade Wang's heart blossomed when he heard their words, and he said, "Good, you go find the fire brigade comrades to work together first, I'll go later."
    They went to the fire brigade, but the comrades were not there, so they came up empty. So they immediately rushed to the mechanical workshop.
    The lights in the yard were out, and it was pitch black. Using the light of the lightning, they groped forward like playing hide-and-seek. Suddenly they heard someone speaking ahead. Lian Zuokuan shouted loudly, "Who's there?" It turned out to be the comrades from the fire brigade. The comrades from the fire brigade told them with mournful faces, "The substation is flooded, and we can't find anything to block it for a while." The three of them were anxious when they heard this and ran towards the substation. The fire brigade comrades also followed them. In the lightning's light, they saw from afar in front of the substation, the rainwater was flowing in like boiling water. Their hearts felt as if they were being grabbed by an eagle, and they wished they could jump into the substation and get the water out. When they arrived in front of the substation, the water was already more than a foot deep, and the low-voltage lines were submerged. They immediately took down the fire-prevention water buckets hanging on the wall, bent down, and started carrying water out. But the water kept flowing in, and even more water accumulated inside. Wang Bingjian immediately suggested, "We have to find a way to block the water outside to prevent it from flowing in, so we can clean it up."
    But how to block it? Everyone was stumped again. Two heads are better than one, and finally someone thought that there were grass sacks in the fourth field. If they brought a few and filled them with soil, wouldn't they be able to block the water? So, some people looked for grass sacks, and others dug ditches. Soon, they blocked the holes under the substation door, and no more water could get in. Then, everyone carried the water inside out bucket by bucket.
    They also closed the other doors in the factory. In this way, the water could not flow into the factory. However, because the rain kept falling, Wang Bingjian, Lian Zuokuan, and Han Lianfa were still not at ease, so they walked around the factory again, checked the situation of several major workshop substations, and only went back to sleep when they were sure that there was no danger.

　　抢救变电所
    大连机械工厂  王福升
    七月十三日夜里，大连机械工厂车床工人王秉俭正在理发馆剪发时，忽然雷声大作，下起大雨来。王秉俭心里一跳，想起工厂的门都没有关，如果进了雨水，工厂就要受损失。车床职场内的变电所门底下有洞，很容易进水，如果包电线的铅管被水浸透，就要跑电，时间长了，包电线的几根铅管子碰在一起，或水浸进电缸里，就会发生燃烧。他理完发，顾不得洗头，立刻就往外跑。到达宿舍时，时间已经过了九点半了，和他一起住的连作宽和韩连发正要睡觉。王秉俭气喘吁吁地说：“坏啦！外面雨下得这样大，工厂的大门都没有关，水一定进去不少啦！咱们一块去看看吧。”三人就直往工厂跑去。地上泥泞，道路不平，很容易把脚陷进泥坑里去；可是他们三个人飞也似地跑到了工厂。
    保卫科王同志站在窗前，望着外面越下越大的雨，心里焦急起来。王秉俭等三人走进来，对王同志说：“厂子里恐怕会进水，我们快想法来堵吧。”王同志听了他们的话，心里像开了花，说：“好，你们先去找消防队同志一块干吧，回头我就去。”
    他们到了消防队那里，消防队的同志们都不在，扑了个空。于是他们立刻又赶到机械职场去。
    场院的电灯灭了，院里漆黑，伸手不见五指。他们借着打闪的光亮，像捉迷藏似的两手摸着往前走。忽听前面有人在说话，连作宽就大声问道：“前面是谁？”原来就是消防队的同志们。消防队的同志哭丧着脸告诉他们：“变电所进了水，一时找不到东西堵。”他们三人一听急了，拔腿就往变电所跑。消防队的同志们也就跟着他们跑。在闪电的光亮下，他们远远望见变电所前，雨水像开了锅似的直往里流，他们的心好像叫老鹰抓去似的难受，恨不得一下跨进变电所把水弄出去。他们走到变电所跟前时，水已进去一尺多深，低压线都被淹得看不见了。他们立刻拿下挂在墙上的防火用水桶，弯下腰就往外提水。可是水还是不断地往里边流，屋里的水积得更多了。王秉俭立刻提出：“得想办法把外面水堵住，不让往里流，才能弄干净。”
    可是怎么堵呢？大家又发了呆。人多出圣人，终于有人想到四分场里有草包，拿来几个装进泥土，不就能把水堵住了吗？于是大家找草包的找草包，挖沟的挖沟，很快地把变电所门下的洞堵好了，水再也进不去了。于是，大家又把里面的水一桶桶地提出来。
    他们又把厂内其他几个门关住了。这样，水就流不进工厂去了。但是，因为雨下个不停，王秉俭、连作宽、韩连发还不放心，又到工厂各处走了一圈，检查了几个主要车间变电所的情况，看看没有什么危险了，才放心回去睡觉。
