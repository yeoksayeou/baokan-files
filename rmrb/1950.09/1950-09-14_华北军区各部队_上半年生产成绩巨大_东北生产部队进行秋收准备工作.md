　　Huge Production Achievements of Various Units of the North China Military Region in the First Half of the Year
    Production Units in Northeast China Prepare for Autumn Harvest
    [Report from this Newspaper] The People's Liberation Army North China Military Region has victoriously completed its production tasks for the first half of this year. The Military Region Production Committee has specially reported to Chairman Mao on the achievements of the entire military region's units in production over the past six months. In accordance with Chairman Mao's "Instructions on the Army's Participation in Production and Construction Work in 1950," the various units of the North China Military Region determined a production policy focusing on agriculture and water conservancy projects. Before the end of February, they completed various production preparations. From early March to mid-April, the various units of the Military Region successively投入 70% to 80% of their labor force into production. By the end of June, the reclamation and sowing of land, as well as water conservancy projects such as digging rivers, building dikes, and repairing canals, were all completed on time. The entire military region cultivated more than 437,600 mu (Editor's note: The July 31st edition of this newspaper, page two, reported a figure of over 300,000 mu, which was an inaccurate statistic). Wheat yielded an average of about 100 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 160 jin. Some units harvested enough vegetables to be completely self-sufficient. Autumn crops such as rice, sorghum, corn, cotton, and millet, if there are no disasters in the future, are estimated to yield a total of over 47,700,000 jin of rice. In terms of water conservancy projects, the units completed over 10,056,000 cubic meters of earthwork on more than 20 rivers in North China, completing over 4 million construction tasks, fulfilling or exceeding the contracted repair tasks on schedule, and ensuring good engineering quality for the vast majority (a section of the Yongding River dike was not solid enough). A total of over 35,050,000 jin of rice was earned in wages. After deducting tool expenses and public contributions, individual dividends could reach 180 to 190 jin of millet. Other industrial and sideline production also generated some income, improving the troops' food. However, many units engaged in industrial production suffered losses or were forced to suspend work due to a lack of investigation and research and blind production.

    [Report from this Newspaper, Shenyang] The People's Liberation Army Northeast Military Region units participating in agricultural production, after completing the summer hoeing and weeding tasks on over 247,000 mu of paddy and dry land in early and mid-August, have begun a campaign of evaluating merits, selecting model workers, and preparing for the autumn harvest. Most of the army's dry land has been cultivated three times, deeply plowed and meticulously worked. The paddy fields have basically met the requirements of "weeding quickly, weeding cleanly, removing grass roots, and not damaging seedlings," completing three rounds of weeding, timely fertilization, and some even weeding four times. Currently, the seedlings are growing strong and free of weeds. The dry land is expected to yield 70% of a normal harvest, and the paddy fields are generally better than those of the local people. If there are no serious disasters, an 80% bumper harvest can be expected.
    During the summer hoeing, most paddy field farms established "production contracts," classifying the land into grades, setting output targets, and assigning them to each company, platoon, squad, and individual based on their labor strength. They used mutual aid and cooperative methods for production, implementing a dedicated responsibility system of collective management and decentralized administration to ensure autumn harvest output. Soldiers demonstrated a high degree of responsibility and labor enthusiasm to complete their production tasks. For example, at the Panshan Farm, many units worked in the rain during the second weeding to complete their tasks ahead of schedule. In addition, many units combined the labor appraisal work during the summer hoeing, implemented a system of calculating work points and piece rates, and launched production competitions and "struggles to win and maintain red flags," thereby increasing production morale and labor efficiency, and laying a good foundation for the merit evaluation and model worker selection campaign.
    After the summer hoeing ended, some farms immediately launched a campaign to evaluate merits and select model workers to summarize achievements, commend advanced producers, and further mobilize for the autumn harvest. A method combining leadership and the masses (after mass evaluation and leadership approval) was adopted to select a large number of production heroes and model workers. A regiment of a certain division at the Panshan Farm alone produced 170 heroes. Another unit selected 41 heroes from four companies and held commendation rallies in a timely manner, giving the heroes spiritual and material rewards.
    Currently, in addition to continuing to protect crops, manage water, and prevent disasters, most farm units have begun cultural studies and various autumn harvest preparations. Most farm leaders have personally or sent people to learn from and investigate the local old farmers about the agricultural tools, labor force, harvesting time, and methods required for the autumn harvest; and will formulate autumn harvest plans based on the research results. It is estimated that the paddy fields can be harvested starting in late September. A division of the Panshan Farm began gathering firewood for fertilizer accumulation every morning and conducting cultural studies every afternoon after the summer hoeing. The division plans to accumulate 36 circles of fertilizer (each circle is eight chi wide, one zhang five chi long, and one chi five cun to two chi deep) and gather 600,000 jin of firewood (estimated to be burned until next autumn) within a month. Recently, they have completed accumulating 31 circles of fertilizer and gathering over 200,000 jin of firewood (in just three days). Another unit has ordered 100 rice threshing machines from a nearby agricultural tool factory and prepared 3,000 sickles and other tools such as winnowing fans, forks, and brooms.

　　华北军区各部队
    上半年生产成绩巨大
    东北生产部队进行秋收准备工作
    【本报讯】人民解放军华北军区各部队已胜利完成今年上半年生产任务，军区生产委会特向毛主席报告半年来全军区部队生产的成绩。遵照毛主席“关于一九五○年军队参加生产建设工作的指示”，华北军区各部队确定以农业和水利建设工程为主的生产方针，二月底以前完成了各项生产准备工作，三月初至四月中旬，军区各部队先后以百分之七十至八十的劳动力投入生产。到六月底止，各部队垦荒播种以及挖河、筑堤、修渠等项水利工程均全部按时完成。全军区部队共耕种了四十三万七千六百余亩（编者按：七月三十一日本报二版曾报道为三十余万亩的数字统计不精确），麦子每亩平均收百斤左右，最高者一百六十斤。菜蔬收获有的部队可全部自给。秋季作物如水稻、高粱、玉茭、棉花、谷子等，今后如无灾害，估计总收获量可折米四千七百余万斤。水利工程方面，各部队在华北二十多条河流上，共完成了一千零五十六万土方以上的工程，施工四百多万个，按期或提前完成了包修任务，绝大部分保证了良好的工程质量（永定河堤工有一段不够坚实）。共得工资米三千五百零五万余斤。除去工具开支和交公任务外，个人分红有的可得一百八、九十斤小米。其他工业和副业生产，均获得一些收入，改善了部队伙食；惟不少搞工业生产的单位，由于缺乏调查研究，盲目生产，造成赔本或被迫停工的现象。（华北解放军报社）
    【本报沈阳讯】人民解放军东北军区参加农业生产的部队，于八月上、中旬适时完成了二十四万七千余亩水旱田的夏锄、拔草任务后，已进行评功选模运动及准备秋收工作。全军大部旱田做到了三铲三趟，深耕细作；水田基本上达到“拔的快、拔的净、除草根、不伤苗”的要求，普遍完成三遍除草，及时施肥，部分曾拔草四遍。目前禾苗茁壮，全部莠穗。旱田可看七成年景，水田一般都比当地群众的为好，如无严重灾害，可望八成丰收。
    夏锄中，多数水田农场订立了“生产合同”；把土地分出等级，定出产量，按劳动力强弱分给每个连、排、班和个人。用变工互助方法进行生产，实行集体经营、分散管理的专责制，以保证秋收产量。战士们为完成生产任务，发挥了高度的责任心与劳动积极性。如盘山农场于拔第二遍草时，许多单位冒雨工作，提前完成了任务。另外，许多单位又结合了夏锄中的劳动评奖工作，实行了计工、计件制度，并展开生产竞赛与“争红旗和保红旗运动”，从而提高了生产情绪与劳动效率，并给评功选模运动打下良好基础。
    夏锄结束后，有些农场为及时总结成绩，表扬生产先进者和进一步动员秋收，随即展开评功选模运动。采取领导与群众相结合的方法（经群众评议、领导批准），选出大批生产功臣模范。仅盘山农场某师一个团就涌现出一百七十名功臣；另部四个连选出四十一名功臣，并及时召开庆功会，给功臣以精神与物质的奖励。
    目前各农场除继续进行护青、看水和防灾外，大部农场部队已展开文化学习和各项秋收准备工作。多数农场负责人均亲自或派人向驻地老农学习与调查秋收所需农具、劳动力及收割时间与方法等；并将根据研究结果订出秋收计划。估计水田可于九月下旬开始收割。盘山农场某师于夏锄后即开始每日上午打柴积肥，下午进行文化学习。该师计划于一个月内积肥三十六圈（每圈八尺宽，一丈五尺长，一尺半至二尺深），打烧柴六十万斤（预计烧到明秋），最近已完成积肥三十一圈，打柴二十万斤（仅三天）以上。另部已与附近农具工场订做百台打稻机，准备三千把镰刀及其他簸箕、杈子、扫帚等工具。
