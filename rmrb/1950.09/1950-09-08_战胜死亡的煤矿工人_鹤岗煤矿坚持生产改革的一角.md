　　Coal Miners Who Conquered Death
　　——A Corner of the Production Reform Persisted in by the Hegang Coal Mine
　　Huashan
　　People have always believed: "Mining coal means people will die." The nine new coal mining sites in Hegang, Northeast China, have eliminated fatal accidents.

　　This is a tremendous victory in the study and application of advanced Soviet experience in China's coal mine production in the past six months. At the same time, the average recovery rate of the new mining sites has increased from 30% to 80%. Among them, the "No. 150" mining site, with a coal seam as thick as six meters, even reached 93%, which is equivalent to extending the life of the mine by two times. This means that in the past, for every 100 tons of underground reserves, only 30 tons of coal were mined, and 70 tons were permanently discarded underground. Now, 93 tons are mined, and only 7 tons are wasted.

　　Ensuring safe production and reducing resource loss are two fundamental problems that have never been well resolved in coal mine production. You would never imagine that this tremendous reform, which eliminated the threat of death, would encounter such strong resistance from conservative thinking at the beginning. The struggle to implement the new coal mining method in Hegang deeply impresses people: without the leadership courage to persevere and the clear idea of resolutely relying on the masses, the implementation of any new reform is impossible.

　　Thick Coal Seams and "Ten Thousand-Man Pits"

　　Eighty percent of the coal seams in Hegang are thick seams of more than six meters. The "high-fall" mining method left by the Japanese invaders is a typical form of all old thick coal seam mining methods.

　　In a coal mining site in a thick coal seam, the "roof" above is coal, the "walls" on both sides are coal, and the "floor" underfoot is either coal or rock. Working inside is like being "a piece of meat sandwiched between four stones," and any collapse is dangerous, not to mention digging the coal high up with your head raised. Therefore, the mining site can only be opened to a height of two meters, and the overhead canopy and stacks must be built at any time to firmly support the "roof." How can it cope with coal seams that are six meters or even dozens of meters thick? The so-called "high-fall" method simply does not use materials to support the "roof." Two small intersecting alley tunnels are dug to form a coal mining site: the "crossroads" are dug into a circular open space, and people flash to the side, drill small holes in the coal seam above the open space, load explosives, attach a fuse, light it, and run away along the tunnel to blast the roof coal down. Then, they stand on the coal pile again, drill holes in the roof coal, load explosives, and... blast down one layer after another. When the pile of coal falling from the crossroads becomes a small mountain, the coal hole above also becomes a "big stage" with a dome-shaped roof.

　　This kind of "big stage," where the safety lamp cannot reach the top, and a piece of coal the size of a fist can kill people if it falls. People shoveling coal underneath are, as the miners say, "one foot already in the Hall of Yama," and often ten or so people are buried all at once. Around the "big stage," "coal walls" and "coal pillars" of one or twenty meters thick must also be left to prevent the entire rock layer above the coal hole from collapsing. --"Eat a bite, throw away a piece," this is why the recovery rate of the high-fall method is only 30%.

　　However, this mining method can save the materials for maintaining the mining site, and does not require laborious excavation. It is completely suitable for the imperialist barbaric plundering policy of "making profits without investing capital." Especially since the Japanese invaders' war of aggression spread from the Chinese mainland to vast areas of Southeast Asia after 1942, the basic construction projects of the Hegang mines have been completely stopped. Only the workers and the "ten thousand-man pits" that abandoned the miners' corpses have more than doubled in two years. --The number of employees increased from 17,000 to 31,000, and the number of "ten thousand-man pits" increased from two to five. The Japanese invaders stuffed this huge labor force, which was deceived and arrested, into the inclined shaft entrances every day, digging tunnels and opening "stages" everywhere. They dug wherever it was convenient. In the mining area of less than 200 square kilometers, more than 500 operating sites were opened, but the coal output of the mining sites was only a quarter of the output of digging tunnels. --Another evil consequence of the "high-fall" method is that the workplaces are scattered, and the tunnel system is complicated and long, like rat holes everywhere. It cannot send in wind or pump out water, creating conditions for destructive water and fire accidents. A single gas explosion burned 98 miners to death. Not to mention the daily sporadic casualties. The "ten thousand-man pits" became terrifying "wolf restaurants" and "dog restaurants."

　　The First Batch of Mining Heroes

　　The new coal mining method is the opposite of the "high-fall" method. The basic form is "layered longwall," which is to divide the raw coal seam into several mining sites, like a building. The "floor slabs" are layers of "roof-supporting coal" left behind. Each "floor" is supported by a large amount of filling material, so it is very safe. The mining site is very wide, and the "coal wall" of the mining work surface is like a long wall. Only two "security coal walls" are left on both sides of the site, so the recovery rate is very high.

　　However, the specifications of the site must also be specially considered.

　　In particular, the "No. 150" mining site designed by engineer Liang Songqiao of Nanshan Mine divides the six-meter-thick coal seam into three sections for mining, and does not leave "roof-supporting coal." Only when mining the lower section, stone chips are knocked down from the roof rock layer of the upper section at the same time, and nine stone piles are built to support the middle section of coal. The second shift stands on the stone piles to mine the middle section of coal, and continues to build the stone piles higher to support the upper section of coal. Then the third shift also mines in this way, builds piles in this way, and supports the rock layer of the roof. The three shifts work in rotation, each mining a section. The three sections of coal wall are like inverted three-level steps, constantly pushing forward. The nine stone piles are also constantly extended forward, becoming nine high walls.

　　How much pressure should the rock layer above bear on this large mining site, which is sixty meters wide? If one stone pile is not built well, it can crush and collapse all nine walls. Even if the stone piles are built well, the rock layer will slowly sink downward, becoming like the bottom of a pot. If the coal miners advance slowly, the three sections of "inverted stairs" cannot often leave the "bottom of the pot," and they will inevitably be crushed and collapsed. It is not okay to advance too fast either; if the front is dug out early, and the stone piles cannot keep up, the coal in the upper section will also collapse downward. --In a word, this strict operating specification and work progress are the opposite of the "high-fall" method's loose labor habits.

　　However, the pit leaders who directly led the new mining sites were precisely the first batch of mining heroes who emerged from the "high-fall experts."

　　This batch of Hegang grassroots backbones from old miners tasted the mining suffering next to the "ten thousand-man pits" in those years. During the most difficult days of the Liberation War, they stood closely with the Communist Party. They dug coal in water pits, used their backs as coal carts, and personally took the lead in doing the most dangerous work. As long as they said "the front line needs coal," they would dig and transport hundreds of tons of coal alone in tunnels that no one dared to enter. They are truly a batch of old miners who are "watertight" and "unmoved by artillery fire," and are loyal to the people's mines.

　　Needless to say, their prestige among the workers. They haven't been crushed to death for ten years. What sounds and movements underground can hide from their ears and eyes? No matter how dangerous the roof is, if he says it will collapse in the afternoon, it will not collapse in the morning; no matter how bad the iron pick and stupid drill are, they can manipulate a few styles as soon as they are picked up. --With these two skills, what difficulties can't be solved in leading the "high-fall"? As long as the squad leader looks back and forth and says "it's okay here," a dozen workers will just rush up in a swarm, regardless of drilling holes, loading explosives, swinging picks, shoveling coal, loading and pushing carts. No matter what work they grab, they can do a job. Even if the site collapses, it's okay, as long as they can produce more coal right now, anyway, they have to open another site next time. There is no need to divide the work, and there is no need to manage the specifications. It is good to be willing to contribute.

　　Now it's different. It takes several months to mine a site to the end, and the face of the site is not allowed to change every day. However, the "No. 150" site has 120 workers in three shifts, and each shift is divided into four major categories of work: mining, filling, support, and transportation. As long as the support port presses the wrong roof pillar, the coal-transporting electric slide will not be able to move forward immediately; if the mined coal cannot be transported out, the coal miners will have to bury themselves in the coal pile if they dig coal again; if mining cannot be carried out, the filling hand has no place to build stone piles; if the lower section stops work, the middle and upper sections have to stop work with it, and the entire site has to be left to be crushed by the sinking roof rock layer. --One pillar can collapse the entire mining site, and the impact of poor work coordination is so great.

　　When something goes wrong at work, the dissatisfaction and difficulties of the entire site are all placed on the pit leader. Such as "the new coal mining method is a waste of effort and does not produce coal, it is not good for the country, and the workers earn less money," "just shouting specifications without showing an example, the higher-ups are fooling around with some new method to ruin people"! ... No matter how angry they are, they have to find a way to do the work well. But the coal cutting machine is broken and the workers can't repair it. They can only stare blankly while watching; they can also see that the roof is about to collapse, but there is no way to prevent it from collapsing. It is useless; if the site cannot be mined, they can't wait to swing all their strength on the coal wall, but everyone can't cooperate, and they can't help even if they follow the shift for fifteen or sixteen hours a day. "It's over, the stupid experience doesn't work!" Deputy pit leader Chen Yanqin was so anxious that he vomited blood, and the old pit leader didn't sleep for seven days and seven nights. He ate a bite of rice at the pit entrance, took a nap, and then went back to the pit. The coal mining site collapsed again and again. He couldn't help but shed tears when he saw the mine manager!

　　"You still let me be a coal mining squad leader! I really can't do it anymore!"

　　Nine Rock Piles

　　Deputy Pit Leader Chen also quarreled as soon as he saw the mine manager, and formally proposed "can't do it" three times in the meeting, requesting to change to the "two-section longwall" that had been successfully tested in the neighboring pit. Especially when the production task of the entire pit could not be completed, and he was scolded by the workers and criticized by the higher-ups, he poured out all his grievances and complaints. "The new direction must also move forward step by step! Don't you know that we are big roughs without technology? There is a ready-made example of 'two sections', but you don't do it, and you make this 'three sections' to make people suffer from both ends!"

　　Mine Manager Ma Yanzhang always comforted him and said: "Failure is not important, the only thing to fear is not finding the cause of the failure. Criticism is also for finding out the problems. To say we don't understand, none of us understand. --Only our Nanshan Mine has a 'three-section' site in the whole country. As long as the direction is right, even if we don't understand, we have to grit our teeth and come up with some experience. 'Go to be a squad leader', this is called lagging behind. Let's have a meeting to study the reasons for the failure!"

　　Despite quarreling with the mine, Deputy Pit Leader always encouraged him when he saw the workers: "Our liberation of coal mines in the country was early, and the new reform must make an example." --This is how the old mining backbones are. No matter how hard it is to get through their thinking, asking him to work negatively is simply more unbearable than scolding him as "Chiang Kai-shek." When the stone pile collapsed for the fourth time, Chen Yanqin saw the trick: the nine stone piles can occupy half of the site when added together. In terms of strength, it cannot be considered small, but the three-meter-thick pile is six meters high, and it will be skewed with a slight pressure. Once skewed, no matter how much force is used, it cannot be exerted. "High-rise buildings have to use thick beams and pillars," wouldn't it be more stable to combine the nine stone piles into seven?

　　Originally, even engineer Liang, who designed the new site, shook his head after a month of unsuccessful work: "The plan is good, but the specifications cannot be made." Meaning the workers are not good, and the best plan is useless. Some technicians also believe that the higher authorities are constantly calling on "learning from workers," but it is just "to make the workers feel comfortable and work harder." At this time, the deputy pit leader's suggestion to relax the stone pile gave a little confidence to persist. After that, the piles never collapsed again, and the understanding of "the combination of technology and labor" became more profound: "The workers can't say it, but they all have a number in their hearts: calculating, the compressive strength of the two kinds of stone piles is the same. Who can think of this principle without rich experience!"

　　From then on, even when hitting a new-style roof-supporting pillar, the technicians also had to explain the intention of sharpening the pillar feet, in order to allow the pillar to shorten as the roof coal sank slightly, so as to avoid being crushed and folded and losing its compressive strength. At the same time, they often asked the workers: is the pressure of the coal subsidence in this section coming fast or slow, and how sharp should the pillar feet be cut to be more suitable. The miners said with emotion: "Technicians look up to us and discuss things with the workers. This is the first time I have encountered this in my life. Everything is explained clearly, so that we also have a number in our hearts, and we can figure out the pros and cons of doing it ourselves!"

　　In this way, the various operating techniques in the new mining site began to slowly become proficient: the roof rock layer no longer collapsed, the Soviet coal cutting machine could also be opened, the giant stone piles were also built firmly, and even the most complicated "lower section" work surface, now the coal cutting machine, air pick, electric drill, electric slide, roof-supporting canopy pillar, rock pile, etc., are all arranged properly, and no one is in the way of anyone.

　　But the site collapsed again because of this. The opinions against the reform made the pit leaders unable to raise their heads again!

　　The Mine Manager from the Battlefield

　　The new site collapsed seven times in a row, and Mine Manager Ma vomited blood and dared not say anything. Originally, he had expected the difficulties and made up his mind when he decided to experiment with "three-section" mining: he transferred the good miners from each inclined shaft to the "No. 150" site. There were more than 40 Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members alone; he gave the best machinery, trained technical workers, and technical cadres. --This kind of strength cannot be considered weak. But now, when the meetings started, the squad leaders always said this: "We have no opinion, we will do whatever the higher authorities want." The pit leaders were either teary-eyed or quarreling, and even the mine's trade union chairman said: "The following is really yelling! It's not that the workers are not doing well, it's just that the specifications are too difficult!"

　　Ma Yanzhang, the secretary of the CCP Nanshan Mine Committee, was born as a worker and fought against Japan for a long time, but he has only been a mine manager for a year. He said that he could not compare with the pit leaders in underground experience, and he could not compare with the engineers in technology, but he brought one thing from the revolutionary battlefield: even the most stubborn enemy is afraid of you if you insist on fighting to the end! When everyone was clamoring and he had no idea himself, he also wondered: could it be that the plan is wrong? But once he asked the reasons for the failure, his determination to persist in the reform became even greater.

　　It turned out that the "inverted stairs" three-way longwall, the upper two sections were suspended and pressed on the stone piles, and the coal quality became loose with a slight subsidence, which was easy to mine. However, the lower section was always opening the road in the front. The coal was hard, and it took a lot of effort to produce little coal. The loose coal above was clearly left for the next shift to mine, and he felt itchy in his heart. The pleasure of hitting "high-fall" came up again: "We are gnawing bones while others are eating meat, this is not okay! We also eat a bite of meat!" He hit down a large pile of coal in a few strokes, and he couldn't take care of it if no one followed up to build the pile. Now the lower section has a coal cutting machine, which cuts into a deep groove along the root of the coal wall, 1.8 meters deep and 70 centimeters high, and can advance 30 to 50 meters in one shift. --Once the root of the coal wall is hollowed out, it is easier to mine than the upper two sections. So others also said: "We also eat a bite of meat!" Regardless of what "specifications" you have, they dig a smooth long wall into a mess in a few strokes. When you go to work again, the coal wall above has already collapsed.

　　This is how stubborn the loose labor habits left by the "high-fall" method are.

　　Without a highly rigorous labor organization, the specifications of the new mining site cannot be guaranteed. Everyone's views on this point are completely consistent. The conclusions, however, were very different. This one said: "'Three-section' mining is too strict; the whole site collapses if you don't take care of it a little. How can a hundred or so people have no negligence or mistakes?" Mine Manager Ma said: "How can you guarantee others if you can't guarantee yourself; if everyone does their own work well, what mistakes will there be in the whole site?" This one said: "We talk about specifications, but he doesn't follow the specifications. 'Specifications' means that we gnaw bones while he eats meat?" Mine Manager Ma said: "Everyone wants to eat meat, but if the site collapses, they can't even gnaw bones; how can progressives look up to the laggards!" This one said: "Progress must also move forward step by step. Wasn't the 'two-section' site learned from the Xi'an Coal Mine!" Mine Manager Ma said: "If everyone is waiting for a ready-made example, then the Xi'an Mine can't make a 'two-section'!" This one said: "Big roughs learn new technologies, and they can't even catch up by dragging and running. Isn't it torturing people to mine 'three sections' at once?" Mine Manager Ma said: "Torture is always better than dying: if you are the master of the mine, you can't let the coal mine kill people again. The imperialists can be overthrown, so why can't the 'high-fall' left by the imperialists be overthrown? If we can't catch up, we have to grit our teeth and come up with some experience. I think we should study how to do the specifications well!"

　　Research showed that the "high-fall" was the basic reason hindering progress, and the deputy pit leader carried the safety lamp again to mobilize: "Do it again! I will lead a squad myself!" The squad leaders also made up their minds and said: "We guarantee that we will do it well! Tomorrow, just invite the director and chief engineer to visit!"

　　It collapsed seven times in six weeks, and finally succeeded. --The eight months since the birth of the "No. 150" new mining site, including the trial period, have not seen any deaths or serious injuries. This mining site not only created the national record for the recovery rate of thick coal seams, but also achieved a huge daily output of more than 300 tons. --The coal miners who have been poisoned by the bloody technology of imperialism for a long time are enduring the pain of self-struggle, breaking free from the heavy burden of inherited experience, conquering death, and creating a new history of people's coal mines that do not kill people.

　　战胜死亡的煤矿工人
    ——鹤岗煤矿坚持生产改革的一角
    华山
    从来人们认为：“要采煤就得死人。”东北鹤岗的九个新采煤场却把死亡事故消灭了。
    这是半年来我国煤矿生产中学习并运用苏联先进经验的巨大胜利。和这同时，新采煤场的回采率平均从百分之三十提高到八十。其中煤层厚达六公尺的“一五○”号采煤场竟达百分之九十三，等于把矿山的寿命延长了两倍。这就是说：对地下每百吨的埋藏量过去仅采出三十吨煤，得同时把七十吨永远扔在地下，现在采出九十三吨，只白扔七吨了。
    保证安全生产，减少资源损失，这是煤矿生产中从来没有很好解决的两大根本问题。你绝想不到，这个消除了死亡威胁的巨大改革，开始时竟会遭到保守思想如此强烈的抗拒。鹤岗贯彻新采煤法的斗争过程使人深深感到：如果没有顽强坚持的领导魄力和坚决依靠群众的明确思想，任何新改革的贯彻实现都是不可能的。
    厚煤层和“万人坑”
    鹤冈的煤层，百分之八十都是六公尺以上的厚煤层。日寇遗留下来的“高落”采煤法，正是一切旧的厚煤层采掘法的典型形式。
    采煤场在厚煤层中，头上的“顶板”是煤，两侧的“墙壁”是煤，脚下的“底板”不是煤就是岩石。人在里面工作，正是“四块石头夹着一块肉”，哪里崩下来都不是玩的，更不用说昂着头挖掘高处的煤了。所以采煤场只能开辟两公尺高，还得随时架头顶棚垒垛子，把“顶板”牢牢支持住。怎能对付得了六公尺甚至几十公尺那样厚的煤层呢？所谓“高落式”，干脆不用材料支持“顶板”，挖两条十字交叉的小巷坑道就算采煤场：把“十字路口”掘成个圆形空场子，人就闪在旁边，往场子上边的煤层钻些小孔，装上火药，按上导火线，点着，顺巷道跑开，把顶煤炸落下来。然后又站到煤堆上，往顶煤里钻孔，装药，……炸落一层又一层，等到十字路口的落煤堆成小山，头顶的煤洞也成了一座穹形屋顶的“大舞台”了。
    这种“大舞台”，安全灯照不到顶，掉下块拳头大的煤来也能砸死人。人在底下铲煤，正像矿工说的，“一条腿已经迈进阎罗殿”，常常十来个人一下子全被埋住了。“大舞台”周围还得留下一二十公尺厚的“煤墙”“煤柱”，不让煤洞上的岩层整个塌下来。——“吃一口，扔一块”，这就是高落式的回采率只有百分之三十的原故。
    可是这种采煤法，能省掉维持采煤场的材料，还用不着费力挖掘，完全适合帝国主义“不下本钱现得利”的野蛮掠夺政策。特别是自一九四二年日寇的侵略战争从中国大陆蔓延到东南亚广大地区以后，鹤岗的矿山基本建设工程已完全停止。只有工人和抛弃矿工尸体的“万人坑”，在两年中增加了一倍以上。——职工从一万七千人增加到三万一千，“万人坑”从两个增加到五个。日寇把这批骗来抓来的巨大的劳动力，天天塞进斜井坑口，到处掘坑道，开“舞台”，那里顺手就在那里开掘。不到二百平方公里的矿区，竟然开辟了五百多个作业场，而采煤场的出煤量反而只有挖掘坑道的产量四分之一。——“高落式”的另一恶果，就是作业场所分散，坑道系统错杂漫长，好像到处乱穿的老鼠洞一样，送不进风，抽不出水，给毁灭性的水火事故造成条件。仅仅一次煤气爆炸，就烧死了九十八个矿工。每天零星的伤亡事故更不用说了。“万人坑”成了怵目惊心的“狼饭店”“狗饭店”。
    第一批矿山功臣们
    新采煤法和“高落”式正相反，基本形式是“分层长壁”，就是将原煤层分成几个采煤场，像楼房一样，“楼板”就是留下的一层层“护顶煤”。每层“楼”都用大量的充填材料把“顶板”支持着，因此很安全。采煤场很宽，采掘工作面的“煤墙”像一道长壁似的，只场子两侧还留有两道“保安煤墙”，因此回采率很高。
    可是场子的规格也要特别讲求了。
    特别是南山矿工程师梁松乔设计的“一五○”采煤场，六公尺厚的煤层就分成三段采掘，也不留下“护顶煤”，只在采掘下段的时候，同时从上段的顶板岩层打下石片来，垒起九座石垛子，把中段的煤支持住。第二班便站在石垛上，采中段的煤，同时继续把石垛垒高，顶住上段的煤。然后第三班也是这样地采掘，这样地垒垛，顶住顶板的岩层。三个班不断轮流工作，各采一段，三段的煤墙就像倒过来的三级阶梯，不断平推前进。九座石垛也不断向前延长，成了九堵高墙。
    这末一个六十公尺宽的大采煤场，压在上空的岩层该有多大压力！一座石垛没垒好，就能把九堵墙全给压歪压塌。就算石垛垒得再好，岩层也要慢慢往下沉，变成个锅底那样，采煤工前进得慢了，那三段“倒楼梯”不能经常离开“锅底”，势必叫压垮台。前进太快也不行；前面早挖空了，石垛子还跟不上来，上段的煤也得往下垮。——一句话，这种严格的作业规格和工作进度，恰恰是和“高落”式的散漫劳动习惯正相反的。
    可是直接领导着新采煤场的坑长，都正是从“高落能手”中涌现出来的第一批矿山功臣。
    这一批老矿工出身的鹤岗基层骨干们，尝尽了当年“万人坑”旁的矿山苦难，在解放战争最困难的日子里和共产党紧靠一起，水坑里挖煤，背脊当煤车，那里最危险就亲自到那里领头干。只要说声“前线要煤”，没人敢进的坑道他们一个人连掘带运，也要弄出百几十吨来。真是一批“装水不漏”，“炮轰不走”，对人民矿山忠心耿耿的老矿工。
    在工人中的威信更不用说了。十来年没叫砸死，坑下有什么音响动静能瞒过他们的耳朵眼睛？再危险的顶板，他说后晌才塌就不会前晌塌下来；再不好用的铁镐笨钻，随便拿过来也能摆弄出几个样子。——凭着这两手，领导打“高落”还有什么解决不了的困难？只消班长来回看看，说声“这里得手”，十来个工人就只管一窝蜂上去，管他钻孔装药，抡镐铲煤，装车推车，抓到什么工作，也能干一场。那怕把场子也挖塌了呢，眼下能多出煤就行，反正下一次又得另开场子了。用不着分工，也不用管规格，肯出力就是好样的。
    现在可不同了。一个场子要采到头得好几个月，每天场子面还不准走样。可是“一五○”场子三个班就有一百二十个工人，每个班还分采煤，充填，支柱，运搬四大类工作。只要支柱口按错了一根顶棚柱子，送煤的电溜子马上不能向前挪动；采下的煤运不出去，采煤工再挖煤就得把自己埋到煤堆里；不能采掘，充填手就没有地方垒石垛；下段一停工，中段上段也只好跟着停工，整个场子也只好听任沉落的顶板岩层压垮了。——一根柱子能弄垮整个采煤场，工作配合不好的影响就是这样大的。
    工作一出毛病，满场子的不满和难题都压到坑长身上来。什么“新采煤法白费力气不出煤，对国家不好工人还少挣钱”啦，“光喊规格不给个样子瞧瞧，都是上级胡弄什么新法糟践人”啦！……不管怎样受气，工作总得想法做好。可是截煤机坏了工人不会修，自己看着也是干瞪眼；也能看出顶板要塌，没办法让它不塌还是白搭；场子挖不出煤，恨不得一下子把全身气力都抡到煤墙上，可是大伙配合不上，每天跟班十五六小时也插不上手。“完了，笨经验吃不开了！”副坑长陈延勤急的吐血，老坑长七天七夜没有睡觉。在坑口吃口饭打个盹又到坑下去了。采煤场还是垮了一次又一次。看见矿长他忍不住掉下泪来！
    “你还是让我当个采煤班长去吧！实在是干不下去了！”
    九座岩石垛子
    陈副坑长也是一见矿长就吵，三次在会上正式提出“干不下去”，要求改成邻坑已经试验成功的“二段长壁式”。特别是全坑的生产任务不能完成，挨工人骂还受上级批评的时候，满肚子冤屈牢骚全兜出来了。“新方向也得一步步往前走啊！你就不知道咱是大老粗没技术？明摆着个‘两段’的现成样子不叫做，弄这‘三段’叫人两头受气！”
    矿长马延章总是安慰说：“失败不要紧，只怕找不出失败的原因。批评也是为的找出毛病来。要说不懂，咱们谁也不懂，——全国只咱们南山矿有个‘三段’场子。只要方向对头，再不懂咱们硬撑着也要弄出点经验来。‘当班长去’，这叫落后。还是开会研究研究失败的原因吧！”
    尽管在矿上吵翻了天，见到工人副坑长总是鼓着劲说：“全国煤矿就咱解放的早，新改革说怎的也得做出个样子来。”——这批矿山老骨干就是这样的，思想再打不通，要他消极怠工简直比骂他“蒋介石”还受不了。石垛子垮到第四次，陈延勤就看出门道来：九座石垛，加起来能占满半个场子，按力量说不能算小，可是三公尺厚的垛子就有六公尺高，稍为一压就歪斜，一歪斜多大的劲都使不出来了。“盖高楼得用粗梁柱”，把九座石垛并成七座不就站得稳当了吗？
    本来，努力一个月没做成功，就连设计新场子的梁工程师也动摇了：“计划是不错，就是规格做不出来。”意思是工人不行，再好的计划也白搭。好些技术人员也认为：上级不断号召“向工人学习”，不过是“让工人听着心里舒服，干活多卖劲”罢了。这时候副坑长提出放宽石垛的意见，才又有了一点坚持的信心。以后垛子再没垮过，对“技术与劳动结合”的体会更深刻了：“工人嘴里说不出，原来心里都有个数的：计算起来，两种石垛的抗压力都一样大，不是经验丰富谁能想出这个道理来！”
    从此，那怕是打一根新式的护顶立柱，技术人员也要说明把柱脚削尖的意图，是为的让顶煤稍为下沉的时候，柱子也能跟着缩短，以免被压歪压折，失去抗压的力量，同时经常问工人：这一段煤下沉的压力来得是急是缓，柱脚削得多尖才更合适。矿工们感动地说：“技术人瞧得起咱，有事和工人商量，这辈子还是头一回碰到。什么事情都交待清楚，让咱心里也有个数，做起来自己也好捉摸个好坏呀！”
    就这末地，新采煤场里的各种操作技术，开始慢慢熟练起来：顶板岩层不再陷塌了，苏联截煤机也会开了，巨型石垛也垒得稳稳当当的了，就是最复杂不过的“下段”工作面，现在截煤机、风镐、电钻、电溜子、护顶棚柱、岩石垛子等等，也都安排得妥妥贴贴的，谁也不妨碍谁了。
    可是场子反而又因此垮了台。反对改革的意见又把坑长们压的抬不起头来啦！
    来自战场的矿长
    新场子连垮七次，马矿长吐了血没敢张声。本来，一开始决定试验“三段”采煤，他就料到困难也下定了决心的：把各斜井的好矿工调到“一五○”场子，光是共产党员和青年团员就有四十几人；给最好的机械，给训练技术工人，给技术干部，——这样的力量不能算弱了。可是现在，开起会来班长们总是这样说：“咱没意见，上级要怎的咱都干就是。”坑长们不是泪汪汪的就是吵翻天，甚至矿山工会主席也说：“下面实在嚷得不行了！不是工人不好好干，实在是规格太难啦！”
    马延章，中共南山矿党委的书记，工人出身，长期打日本，当矿长却只一年。说坑下经验不能比坑长，说技术不能比工程师，革命战场上却带来了一条：再顽强的敌人也怕你坚持打到底！当大家嚷得自己也没了主意的时候，他也怀疑：莫不是计划不对吗？可是一经追问失败原因，坚持改革的决心更大了。
    原来，“倒楼梯”式的三道长壁，上两段都是悬空压在石垛上的，稍为下沉煤质就松了，好采掘。下段却总在头里开路，煤硬，费大劲出煤不多。头顶的松煤却明摆着留给下班采，心里怪痒痒的，一抬头那股打“高落”的痛快劲又上来了：“咱啃骨头人家吃肉，这还行！咱也吃一口肉！”上去几下子就把煤打落一大堆，没人跟着垒垛也顾不上了。现在下段来了截煤机，顺着煤墙根割进去就是一道深槽，一·八公尺深，七十公分高，一个班能前进三五十公尺。——煤墙根一经掏空，比上两段就更好采掘了。于是旁人也说：“咱也吃一口肉！”管你什么“规格”，几下子就把平展展的一道长壁掘个稀烂。等你再上班时，头上的煤墙早塌下来了。
    以后实行了苏联的“生产指示图表”制度，采煤场里最难掌握的生产程序和劳动组织已经彻底解决：每天二十四小时内，谁从几点做到几点，从哪里做到哪里，做什么，做多少，都画在一幅简单明了的图表上。照着图表工作，每个人就能像火车那样，一天开到晚谁也妨碍不了谁。大家都说：“这可省心了！”可是一看见有块好挖的煤，那股打“高落”的痛快劲又涌上心头，不给它两下子浑身总痒得难受。等到想起“指示图”时，百几十吨煤已经落地，采煤场也只好跟着垮了。
    “高落”式留下来的散漫劳动习惯就是这样顽固的。
    没有高度严密的劳动组织，就不能保证新采煤场的规格。这一点大家的看法完全一致。结论却大不相同了。这个说：“‘三段’采煤太严格了；一点照顾不到全场就垮。一百几十人哪能没点疏忽差错？”马矿长就说：“保证不了自己怎能保证旁人；每个人自己都做好了全场还有什么差错来？”这个说：“咱讲规格他不规格，‘规格’就是叫咱啃骨头他吃肉？”马矿长就说：“大家都想吃肉，场子弄垮了连骨头也啃不上的；进步的哪能向落后看齐！”哪个说：“进步也得一步步走啊，‘两段’场子还不是在西安煤矿学来的！”马矿长就说：“都等着现成样子，西安矿就不能做个‘两段’来！”这个说：“大老粗学新技术，连拖带跑还撵不上，一下子就采‘三段’不是叫人活受罪？”马矿长就说：“活受罪总比死人好受些：做了矿山主人就不能再让煤矿砸死。帝国主义都能打倒了，为什么帝国主义留下来的‘高落式’反而打不倒它？撵不上咱们硬撑着也要弄出点经验来。我看还是好好研究一下怎样把规格做好吧！”
    研究出“高落”式正是妨碍进步的基本原因，副坑长背起安全灯又来动员了：“再干！我亲自带一个班！”班长们也下决心说：“保证搞好了！明天只管请局长和总工程师来参观！”
    六周间连垮七次，终于成功，——“一五○”号新采煤场诞生以来的八个月，包括试验期间在内，没有发生死亡和重伤事故。这个采煤场不仅创造了厚煤层回采率的全国纪录，日产量也达到了三百余吨的巨大数量。——被帝国主义的血腥技术长期毒害着的煤矿工人，就是这样地忍受着自我斗争的痛苦，挣脱因袭经验的重压，战胜死亡，创造着不死人的人民煤矿新史迹。
