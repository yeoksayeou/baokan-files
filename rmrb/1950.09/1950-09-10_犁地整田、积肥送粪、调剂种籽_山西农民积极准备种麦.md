	Plowing and Preparing Fields, Accumulating and Delivering Manure, Adjusting Seed Varieties
    Shanxi Farmers Actively Prepare for Wheat Planting
    [Our Newspaper] Farmers in various parts of Shanxi are actively engaged in preparing for wheat sowing, including plowing and preparing fields, accumulating and delivering manure, and adjusting wheat seed varieties. The Yuncheng Special District, one of the province's main wheat-producing areas, comprehensively launched a wheat field cultivation campaign in mid-August. Currently, the entire district's six million mu of wheat land has generally been plowed twice, and many areas have entered the third plowing. In Yi County, two-thirds of the county's wheat land has been plowed for the third time. In Wenxi, Xia County, Jishan, Jiang County, and other places, many farmers are improving wheat field soil by using soil to pad the land while plowing. According to statistics from forty villages in these four counties, farmers voluntarily cooperated to turn and pad the soil on a total of 14,429 mu. In the Dongwu, Lingxi, and Xiabaitu villages of Wenxi District, each household has carried soil to repair and pad more than three mu of wheat land. Simultaneously with plowing, farmers in various places have launched a mass manure accumulation campaign, striving to apply more fertilizer to wheat fields. Farmers in 95 villages in 11 counties, including Huguan, Xiangyuan, Zuoquan, and Yushe, had cut more than 13 million jin of artemisia by the end of August, massively composting green manure; in addition, they also adopted various methods such as collecting road manure, sweeping soil roads, and removing manure from pens to accumulate more than 1.2 million dan of miscellaneous fertilizer. To promote improved wheat varieties, governments and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels have actively carried out improved seed adjustment and organized the masses to exchange and borrow from each other. The Yuncheng Special District Farm transferred 33,170 jin of high-quality wheat varieties such as No. 60 and Biyu wheat to various counties. The Lingchuan County People's Government established county- and village-level seed adjustment and loan committees to organize farmers to exchange wheat seeds, in order to help farmers solve the difficulty of lacking seeds and facilitate the promotion of improved wheat varieties, and has already issued 90,000 jin of grain for seed loans. The Ruicheng County Government focused on promoting 2,100 jin of Biyu wheat in four key villages. Farmers in Wanli Village, Fourth District of Pingshun, lent and exchanged improved varieties between households and mutual aid teams. Within one day, 58 households exchanged 4 shi and 1 dou of Hongtu wheat and 1 shi and 4 dou of Baimang wheat. In many villages in the First District of Huguan, wheat suffered from hail and jaundice this summer, and the wheat grains were shriveled and not suitable for planting; district cadres conducted shriveled wheat germination experiments in Suizhuang and Guanbi villages to enlighten farmers to exchange seeds. The test results showed that only 30 out of 72 wheat grains germinated; the above test results were announced at the cadre meeting of the disaster-stricken villages on August 10, which enabled the village cadres who originally had wrong ideas such as "jaundice is a natural disaster" and "shriveled wheat is numerous, saving seeds" to clear their minds and actively organize and mobilize the masses to borrow and exchange wheat seeds from relatives and friends in non-disaster areas; the district government and cooperatives also actively purchased and transported adjustments to non-disaster areas. According to statistics, the entire district originally needed a total of 506 shi of wheat seeds. After borrowing, exchanging, and adjusting, as of August 22, only 39 shi were still lacking, and it was no problem to sow all good seeds. Warm water seed soaking and chemical disinfection are relatively common in Shanxi Province, and farmers already have certain techniques and experience. The wheat that was soaked and disinfected last year had fewer diseases and higher yields this year, which further proved this scientific method with facts. Farmers in various places have paid attention to this work in the preparation for wheat planting. For example, Wang Shouyuan of Limiaopo Village, Xiangyuan County, often had wheat smut in the past because he did not pay attention to technology. He planted five mu of wheat the year before last and harvested two shi of wheat last year; when he planted wheat last autumn, he exchanged good seeds and soaked them. This year, the wheat did not have smut, and he harvested five shi of wheat. He has decided to select and soak seeds when planting wheat this autumn. In addition to calling for planting improved varieties and soaking and disinfecting seeds, the counties in the Yuncheng Special District also advocated mixing seeds with oil. Wenxi Dongshand had planned to plant 640 mu of Jinguobinyin wheat, half of which was mixed with oil; Xia County had mixed more than 32,000 jin of wheat seeds with oil. Bi Fengwu, Cao Chunfu, and Bi Xiangrong, members of the Xiaositou Village branch of the Communist Party in Wenxi, took the lead in educating the masses about oil-mixing wheat seeds using the experimental method of "small farms". Using the same wheat seeds, one part was mixed with oil, one part was soaked in warm water, and the other part was not disinfected or mixed with oil, and planted on the same piece of land. The test results showed that the two parts mixed with oil and soaked in warm water germinated and emerged from the soil in four days, and the wheat seedlings were very strong, but the part mixed with oil was brownish-green, and the part soaked in warm water was lighter in green; while the part not mixed with oil and warm water was about two days later than the first two parts to germinate, and the seedlings were thin and weak, and there were also a few bad ones. This method is being promoted everywhere in the Yuncheng Special District. In addition, farmers in various places have also added livestock and farm implements to meet the needs of wheat planting. For example, at the temple fair in Xijing Village, Wanquan County, on the tenth day of the seventh lunar month, a total of 17 heads of livestock, 19 new drills, 187 plowshares, 13 harrows, and 14 plows were sold in various trading markets in one day, and 21 old drills were repaired. However, some areas have not paid enough attention to wheat planting. For example, some farmers in Qinshui County had the idea of "leisure in July, take a break" after the summer hoeing, which affected the development of wheat planting preparation work. The county's leading organs have transferred 21 cadres to various villages to promote the masses to carry out various wheat planting preparation work such as turning wheat land and accumulating fertilizer by means of in-depth inspection and typical demonstration.

　　犁地整田、积肥送粪、调剂种籽
    山西农民积极准备种麦
    【本报讯】山西各地农民正在积极进行犁地整田、积肥送粪、调剂麦种等小麦播种的准备工作。该省主要产麦区之一的运城专区，八月中旬全面地展开了耕麦田运动，目前全区六百万亩麦地大体已普犁二遍，不少地区已进入三遍耕垡，猗氏县全县麦地第三遍已犁过三分之二。闻喜、夏县、稷山、绛县等地，很多农民在犁地时用担土垫地的办法，改良麦田土壤。据该四县四十个村统计，农民在自愿合伙的方式下，翻地垫土共达一万四千四百二十九亩；闻喜一区东吴、岭西、下柏土等村农民，每户都担土修垫麦田三亩以上。与犁田同时，各地农民又展开了群众性的积肥运动，争取麦田多施肥料。壶关、襄垣、左权、榆社等十一县九十五个村的农民，至八月底已割蒿一千三百余万斤，大量沤制绿肥；另外又采取了拾路肥、扫土道、出圈粪等各种方法积杂肥一百二十余万担。为推广优良麦种，各级政府，供销社都积极进行了良种调剂，并组织群众互换、互借。运城专区农场调到各县六十号及碧玉麦等优良麦种三万三千一百七十斤；陵川县人民政府成立了县、村两级调种和贷种委员会，负责组织农民调换麦种，以帮助农民解决缺乏种籽的困难和便利优良麦种的推广，并已发放麦种贷粮九万斤。芮城县府以碧玉麦二千一百斤，集中四个村重点推广。平顺四区湾里村农民，在户与户、互助组与互助组之间相互贷换优良品种，一天内即有五十八户调换红秃麦种四石一斗、白芒麦种一石四斗。壶关一区不少村庄的小麦，今夏曾遭到雹灾和黄疸病害的侵蚀，麦粒羸瘪，不宜种植；区干部为启发农民调换种籽，在睢庄、关壁两村进行瘪麦发芽试验，试验结果，七十二颗麦粒只有三十粒出芽；于八月十日的受灾村干部会议上将上项试验结果宣布，使原来存有“黄疸是天年”，“瘪麦数多，省籽”等错误认识的村干部打通了思想，回村积极组织、发动群众到非灾区亲戚朋友家借、换麦种；区政府、合作社也积极到非灾区购运调剂。据统计，全区原共需麦种五百零六石，经过借、换和调剂，至八月二十二日，仅尚差三十九石，全部播种良种已不成问题。温汤浸种和药剂消毒，在山西省比较普遍，农民并已有了一定的技术和经验，去年经过浸种和消毒的小麦，今年病害少、产量大，又给这种科学办法以事实证明。各地农民都已在准备种麦工作中注意了这一工作。如襄垣县李庙坡村王收元，由于过去不讲技术，小麦常生乌霉，前年种麦五亩，去年收麦两石；去秋种麦时调换了好种，又进行了浸种，今年小麦未生乌霉，收麦五石。他已决定今秋种麦一定经过选种和浸种。运城专区各县除号召种植优良品种和浸种、消毒外，并提倡用油拌种。闻喜东山底计划金裹银麦六百四十亩，油拌二分之一；夏县已油拌三万二千余斤。闻喜小寺头村党员毕凤梧、曹春富、毕向荣，带头以“小农场”的试验办法，教育群众油拌麦种。用同样麦种，一份油拌、一份温浸，另一份不消毒、不拌油，种在同一块土地上。试验结果，油拌、温浸的两份四天即发芽出土，麦苗都很茁壮，惟拌油的一份呈褐绿色，温浸的一份绿色较浅；而未拌油和温浸的一份，较前两份发芽约迟两天，且幼苗细弱，还有几棵坏的。这种办法，在运城专区正到处推广。此外，各地农民还添买牲畜、农具，以应种麦时之需用。如万泉县西景村七月初十（夏历）的庙会上，一天之内，各交易市场共售出牲口十七头，新耧十九张，犁铧一百八十七面，耙十三个，犁十四张，并有旧耧二十一张经过了修理。但也有些地区对种麦工作未引起足够重视。例如沁水县部分农民在夏锄结束后，曾产生了“闲七月，歇一歇”的思想，以致影响了种麦准备工作的开展。该县领导机关已抽调干部二十一人分赴各村，用深入检查、典型示范的办法，推动群众进行翻麦地，积肥料等各项种麦准备工作。（新华社、山西日报，通讯员延子慎、董贵、郭忠华、刘凤岐、宋晋书、杨克明、郭宏太、任福永、宋天喜、王泉水、郭忠强）
