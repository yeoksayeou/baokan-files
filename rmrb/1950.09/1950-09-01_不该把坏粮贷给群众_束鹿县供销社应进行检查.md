　　Bad Grain Should Not Be Lent to the Masses
　　Shulu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Should Conduct Inspection

To the Editor:

　　This year, the Shulu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has serious shortcomings in its grain lending and exchange work, causing losses to the masses.

　　Before the wheat harvest, the cooperative accepted 748,837 jin of millet lent by the grain company, intending to re-lend or exchange it with the people, to be repaid with wheat after the wheat harvest. A total of 11,495 jin was exchanged and 426,271 jin was lent out before the wheat harvest. Because the quality of the millet was poor, many people were unwilling to borrow it. Therefore, the 311,071 jin in storage could not be lent out. According to the cooperative's inspection, the millet that was lent out not only produced less rice, but the rice quality was also very poor. For example, Deng Laoxing of Nanweibo Village, District Two, borrowed 167 jin of millet and only milled 98 jin of rice, with a yield of only 58.5 jin per 100 jin (generally, millet can yield 75 jin of rice per 100 jin). At the same time, the milled rice lacked stickiness, could not be made into dry rations, and turned gray when cooked into rice. Therefore, many farmers requested to return the borrowed millet. Some people said, "If you don't allow returns, we won't repay with wheat!". Recently, when cadres from the supply and marketing cooperative went to Langkou Village in District Five to lend coal, the masses said, "Your millet is bad, the coal can't be good either, we won't borrow it." This affected the progress of the lending work.

　　In addition, the commandist style of certain cadres in the lending work had an even worse impact. For example, when some cadres mobilized the masses to borrow grain in Sisang Village, District Six, the masses knew the millet was bad and were unwilling to borrow it. He then said to the village cadres, "This is a task, if the masses don't borrow, the village cadres must take the lead!" As a result, although the village cadres borrowed the grain, they still did not set an example. And afterwards, the village cadres regretted it and also requested to return the borrowed millet.

　　Exchanging coarse grains for fine grains is intended to maintain price balance and overcome the phenomenon of cheap wheat and expensive coarse grains before and after the wheat harvest in the past. It aims to prevent farmers from suffering losses and solve the problem of farmers' livelihood difficulties during the lean season, but now it has produced the opposite result.

　　I hope that the relevant departments will promptly study appropriate solutions to reduce the losses of borrowers and state assets; at the same time, it is necessary to seriously investigate the reasons for the poor grain quality. If the quality has decreased due to poor grain storage work, the custodians should be given due punishment. If the relevant departments were clearly aware of the poor grain quality but did not inform the masses, they should make a self-criticism. Those cadres who forcibly lent grain to farmers should also be given due criticism and punishment in order to restore the prestige of the people's government.

### 不该把坏粮贷给群众  束鹿县供销社应进行检查

　　不该把坏粮贷给群众
    束鹿县供销社应进行检查编辑同志：
    今年，束鹿县供销社在贷粮和换粮工作中存在严重缺点，使群众受到了损失。
    该社在麦前接受了粮食公司贷给的谷子七十四万八千八百三十七斤，准备转贷给或换给老百姓，在麦收后归还小麦。计麦前共换出一万一千四百九十五斤，贷出四十二万六千二百七十一斤。因谷子质量不好，很多群众不愿再贷。因此库存的三十一万一千零七十一斤即不能贷出。据该社检查，贷出之谷子不仅出米少而且米质很差。如二区南位伯村邓老星贷了谷子一百六十七斤，仅碾出小米九十八斤，每百斤仅出米五十八斤半（一般谷子每百斤可出米七十五斤）。同时碾成的米没有粘性，不能做干粮，做成的饭变成灰色。因此很多农户要求退回贷谷。有的人说：“不叫退不还麦！”。最近供销社干部到五区朗口村去贷放煤，群众说：“你们的谷子不好，煤也强不了，我们不贷。”影响了贷放工作的进行。
    另外，某些干部在贷放工作中有命令主义作风，影响更坏。如有的干部在六区泗上村发动群众贷粮时，群众知道谷子坏不愿贷，他就向村干部说，“这是任务，群众不贷，村干要带头！”结果村干部虽贷了谷，仍没带起头来。而事后村干部又后悔起来，也要求退回贷谷。
    以粗粮换细粮，是为了保持物价平衡，克服已往麦收前后麦贱粗粮贵的现象。使农户不吃亏，并解决农民在青黄不接时的生活困难，而现在却造成了相反的结果。
    我希望有关部门迅速研究适当的解决办法，以减少贷户及国家资财的损失；同时还要认真追查粮质不好的原因。如因粮食保管工作做得不好而使质量降低，应给保管者以应得处分。如主管部门明知粮质坏而未向群众说明，应作检讨。对那些向农民强行贷放的干部，也要给以应得的批评和处分，以挽回人民政府的威信。
