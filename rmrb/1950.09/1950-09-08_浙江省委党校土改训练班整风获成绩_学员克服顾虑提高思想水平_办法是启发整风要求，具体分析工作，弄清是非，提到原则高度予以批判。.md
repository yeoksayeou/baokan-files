[Report from the Liberation Daily] The Land Reform Training Class of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee has overcome various ideological obstacles in its rectification campaign, and the students' ideology has been improved. The trainees in this class are mainly district committee secretaries and land reform leaders from prefectural and county committees, as well as some cadres from prefectural and county committees responsible for running training classes. The training steps are to first carry out rectification, then study the basic policies of land reform, research the characteristics of the Zhejiang region, and discuss the implementation methods of this winter's land reform. The rectification began on June 24 and ended on July 11. The successful completion of this rectification training has laid a good foundation for carrying out the province-wide rectification movement and the land reform movement after this autumn. The process of rectification in the school, the ideological situation of the cadres, and the methods for solving ideological obstacles are described below:

(1) In the beginning, many cadres lacked a correct understanding and attitude towards rectification. For example, some comrades believed that "rectification is irrelevant," "there is nothing to rectify," or wanted to take this opportunity to rest and enjoy West Lake. Some were afraid of rectification. Some felt that they were here to lead the rectification and were unwilling to participate in group rectification. Cadres who had not undergone rectification were mainly unsure, suspicious, or held a wait-and-see attitude.

To overcome the above ideological biases, the school adopted two methods: First, it repeatedly mobilized through general meetings and group meetings, explaining the purpose, principles, and methods of rectification, to establish a correct attitude among cadres. However, due to the short discussion time, the gains were not significant. Second, it laid an ideological foundation for rectification through current affairs study. That is, by studying the characteristics and development prospects of the current situation, as well as the basic line, policies, and strategies of the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, several new basic viewpoints were clearly established as ideological weapons to criticize the old ideological viewpoints in past work, improve cadres' political awareness and policy level, make cadres initially realize the harm of erroneous ideological styles to work, and inspire cadres' demand for rectification.

(2) When entering the stage of examining ideological style, the main ideological obstacle for cadres was the lack of a correct understanding of carrying out criticism and self-criticism. This was mainly reflected in the relationship between leaders and those led: those led dared not boldly criticize leaders, fearing retaliation and harboring prejudices; leaders could not let go of their airs and were not humble in accepting criticism from below. Secondly, general cadres had individualistic thoughts, fearing losing face, making public self-criticisms in front of the masses, and being punished.

In response, they adopted three methods: First, repeatedly conduct mobilization and education to break down various misgivings, but this work was not done enough and failed to completely solve the problem. Second, break through the thinking of leading cadres, calling on them to first express their attitude and take the lead in conducting sincere and thorough self-criticism. Wherever this could be done, the criticism movement could be carried out smoothly. Third, when there were serious and prominent problems in the leadership of some units, which became obstacles to rectification, a combination of top-down self-criticism and bottom-up criticism was adopted to promote the rectification movement.

(3) When the rectification turned to studying methods for improving work style in the future, the ideological obstacle among cadres was doubt about the effectiveness of methods to overcome shortcomings. For example, fearing that if the work style of leading organs was not changed, the work style below would be difficult to change; fearing that if their own work style was changed, other comrades would not change and it would not help; fearing that there would be no way to deal with actual difficulties when returning; lacking concrete methods on how to get rid of bureaucracy and how to follow the mass line, etc. On the one hand, this was because the rectification focused on criticizing the old ideological style, so that cadres only saw shortcomings and rarely saw advantages, and the promotion of advantages and criticism of shortcomings were not well combined, resulting in cadres' lack of confidence in improving work. At the same time, it was also because the leadership of the training class lacked a strong enlightening report on leadership methods and the mass line. On the other hand, it was because some cadres themselves were not humble enough and unwilling to learn from others' experiences.

Based on the above situation, the Provincial Party Committee made a correct estimate of the achievements of past work at the Provincial Party Congress, put forward specific methods on how to strengthen leadership, and also strictly criticized the above-mentioned idea of ​​not humbly learning from others' experiences. Due to the short time and the lack of in-depth discussion, only the leadership method and the idea of ​​being unhumble were generally resolved, and the confidence in improving the work style was not strong enough, which needs to be further resolved in future practical work.

The school has the following experiences in this rectification: First, the rectification method of summarizing work, examining work, carrying forward advantages, criticizing shortcomings, clarifying right and wrong, and analyzing and criticizing by raising to the level of ideological principles makes cadres feel relaxed and happy, and only in this way can rectification become a conscious movement. In terms of the content of work style examination, focusing on the characteristics of the province, we should firmly grasp the examination of bureaucracy and commandism as the center, and do not expand the scope or shift the center, otherwise, many life or historical details will be involved, and no problem can be solved. Second, in order to make cadres aware of the harm of bureaucracy and commandism to work, errors must be systematically and concretely exposed. When analyzing, do not stop at the analysis of general reasons, and do not first find a hat of what ism to limit the specific analysis. When studying methods to overcome shortcomings, do not be empty and general, but prescribe the right medicine according to each person's main shortcomings and ideological roots. Organizing various typical reports is a good way to promote the rectification movement; however, the materials must be reviewed in advance and organized in a clear manner, and the reports must be timely. This Party School did not organize the typical reports well and was not timely, so it did not receive the expected effect. Third, regarding the steps of rectification, the leadership should first make a comprehensive and self-critical comprehensive report against bureaucracy, and then organize everyone to study this report, and then conduct self-examination from top to bottom level by level according to the report, combined with bottom-up criticism, and solve problems level by level from leading cadres to general backbones. When making self-criticism, advantages and disadvantages must be reviewed at the same time.

　　浙江省委党校土改训练班整风获成绩
    学员克服顾虑提高思想水平
    办法是启发整风要求，具体分析工作，弄清是非，提到原则高度予以批判。
    【本报讯】据解放日报消息：中共浙江省党委党校土改训练班，克服了整风中的层层思想障碍，学员思想已获得提高。该校本期受训学员主要是区委书记及地委、县委的土改领导干部，另有一部分各地委、县委负责办训练班的干部。训练步骤是首先进行整风，然后学习土改基本政策，研究浙江地区的特点，并讨论今冬土改实施办法。整风自六月二十四日开始，至七月十一日结束。本期整风训练的胜利完成，对开展全省整风运动及今年秋后的土地改革运动，奠定了良好基础。兹将该校整风过程及干部思想情况、解决思想障碍的方法分述于后：
    （一）开始时，不少干部对整风缺乏正确认识与正确态度。如部分同志认为“整不整无所谓”、“没什么可整”，或想趁此机会休息一下，玩玩西湖。有的则怕整。有的认为自己是来领导整风的，不愿意参加小组整风。没有经过整风的干部，主要是摸不到底，怀疑，或抱观望态度。
    为克服上述思想偏向，该校采取了两种办法：第一，通过大会、小组会反复动员，说明整风的目的、方针、方法，以树立干部的正确的整风态度。但由于讨论时间少，致收获不大；第二，通过时事学习，打下整风思想基础。即通过研究目前形势特点及发展前途，与三中全会基本路线、方针、策略等问题，明确树立几个新的基本观点，作为思想武器，以批判过去工作中的旧的思想观点，提高干部的政治觉悟与政策水平，使干部初步认识到错误思想作风对工作的危害，启发干部的整风要求。
    （二）当进入检查思想作风时，干部思想上的主要障碍是对开展批评与自我批评缺乏正确认识。这主要表现在领导者与被领导者关系上：被领导者不敢大胆批评领导者，怕领导者报复，存成见；领导者则放不下架子，不虚心接受下面批评。其次，一般干部存在着个人主义思想，怕丢面子，怕在群众面前进行公开检讨，怕受处分等。
    对此，他们采取了三种办法：第一，反复进行动员教育，打破各种顾虑，但由于这项工作做得不够，未能完全解决问题。第二，打通领导干部的思想，号召他们首先表明态度，并带头进行诚恳的彻底的自我检讨。凡能够这样做的，批评运动即能顺利开展。第三，某些单位领导上存在着严重突出的问题，成为整风的障碍时，即采取自上而下的自我检讨与自下而上的批评相结合的方式，以推动整风运动。
    （三）当整风转入研究今后改进作风的方法时，干部中的思想障碍是：对克服缺点的方法是否有效表示怀疑。如怕领导机关的作风不改，下面作风也难改；怕自己作风改了，其他同志不改也不顶事；怕回去遇到实际困难没有办法；对如何摆脱事务主义，如何走群众路线没有具体办法等。这一方面是由于整风时偏重了批判旧的思想作风，使干部只看到缺点，很少看到优点，发扬优点与批判缺点没有很好结合，致使干部对改进工作的信心不强；同时也是因为训练班的领导方面对领导方法与群众路线问题缺乏一个有力的启发报告。另一方面是某些干部本身不够虚心，不愿学习别人的经验所致。
    根据上述情况，省委在省党代会上，对过去工作成绩作了正确的估计，对如何加强领导问题，提出了具体方法，对上述不虚心学习别人经验的思想也作了严格批判。由于时间短促，讨论不深刻，只一般地解决了领导方法及不虚心的思想问题，对改进作风的信心尚不够强，这有待于今后在实际工作中继续求得解决。
    该校在这一期整风中，有如下几点体会：一、总结工作检查工作，发扬优点批判缺点，弄清是非并提高到思想原则上来分析批判的整风方法，干部均感觉轻松愉快，也只有这样，整风才能成为自觉的运动。在检查作风的内容上，针对本省特点，应紧紧掌握以检查官僚主义与命令主义为中心，不要扩大范围，转移中心，否则牵连许多生活或历史细节，则任何问题都不能解决。二、为使干部认识官僚主义命令主义对工作的危害，须对错误作系统的具体的揭发。在分析时，不要停止在一般原因的分析上，也不要先找好什么主义的帽子，而限制了具体的分析。在研究克服缺点的方法时，不要空洞一般，而要根据各人主要缺点及思想根源对症下药。组织各种典型报告是推动整风运动的良好方法；但材料必须事先经过审查，并整理的条理分明，同时报告要及时。这期党校对典型报告没有组织好，又不及时，所以没有收到应有效果。三、关于整风的步骤，应先由领导方面作一个全面的有自我批判的综合性的反官僚主义的报告，然后即组织大家学习这一报告，再根据报告自上而下地逐级进行检讨，结合自下而上的批评，由领导干部到一般骨干，逐级解决问题。检讨时优点与缺点须同时联系检讨。
