　　In Combination with Implementing the Spirit of the Second Northeast Tax Conference
    Fushun Tax Bureau Conducts Rectification
    Preliminary Inspection of Leadership Style Reveals Many Problems
    [This newspaper Fushun News] Since the Second Northeast Tax Conference, the Fushun City Tax Bureau decided to begin inspecting and rectifying work style from top to bottom in August. Preliminary findings have already revealed many problems.

    The bureau began its rectification campaign on August 3rd, starting with the leadership conveying the spirit of the Second Northeast Tax Conference. After a report based on the specific situation in the city was made, everyone engaged in discussions, studied documents, took notes, and prepared to offer opinions. To thoroughly inspect the work, it was necessary to proceed with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Responsible cadres of the bureau first worked on the thinking of section and office chiefs, explaining the significance and main purpose of this rectification, clarifying thinking, stabilizing emotions, and dispelling the ideological concerns of individual worried office chiefs, thereby increasing confidence. Consequently, everyone was able to expose policy and ideological deviations, as well as deviations in work, within themselves and their units at the meeting. Many bad habits in work style were also discussed quite thoroughly. The main deviations that were examined were a singular focus on tasks and a sole reliance on punishment to solve problems. For example, some cadres excessively emphasized the speculative side of businessmen, resulting in prejudice, so that when taxpayers requested postponements or reductions in payments, they invariably adopted three solutions: 1. Pay late fees, 2. Find a guarantor, 3. Go to court. One section chief confessed: "In the past, in order to complete the task, I would go to the accounting section at the end of each month to see how many tasks had been completed; if they had not been completed, I would immediately call a meeting of the inspectors to arrange work and encourage them by saying, 'See who investigates the most and fines the most.'" Many instances of collecting taxes that should not have been collected, and not collecting taxes that should have been collected, were also examined. Some were impatient when answering questions from businessmen, saying things like, "Go ask the Northeast People's Government!" Some tax bureaus set up suggestion boxes, but turned a deaf ear to taxpayers' suggestions, refusing to change what should be changed, and being self-righteous. Regarding the handling of violations, some section chiefs, due to past leadership emphasis on tasks and the statement that there should be no one-sided "benevolent governance" view towards businessmen, hesitated when dealing with cases of businessmen evading taxes, either not punishing them or punishing them lightly, fearing criticism for having a "benevolent governance" view, and so simply punished them harshly. Therefore, some businessmen reflected, "The tax bureau is incredible, they fine you as soon as they catch a violation."

    The above situation shows that there are many problems in the policy thinking and work style of the bureau's leading cadres and section and office chiefs. The bureau is now enthusiastically launching a comprehensive inspection campaign in order to improve future work.

　　结合贯彻东北二届税务会议精神
    抚顺税务局进行整风
    初步检查领导作风已发现不少问题
    【本报抚顺讯】自东北二届税务会议后，抚顺市税务局即决定在八月份中，自上而下开始检查工作及整顿工作作风。并已初步发现不少问题。
    该局自八月三日起即有步骤地开始进行整风，首先由领导人传达东北二届税务会议精神，并根据该市具体情况作出报告后，大家即进行酝酿，学习文件，记笔记，准备提意见。为使彻底检查工作，必须以批评与自我批评的精神来进行，该局负责干部首先对科、所长级的干部打通思想，说明了这次整风的意义和主要目的，明确思想，稳定情绪，解除了个别发愁的所长的思想顾虑，增强了信心。因而在会议上都能揭露个人及本单位的政策思想偏差及工作中的偏差；作风上的坏毛病也谈了不少，且比较彻底。检讨出来的主要的偏差，是单纯任务观点和单纯依靠处罚来解决问题。如有的干部过分强调了商人投机取巧的一面，产生了偏见，以致在工作中遇到纳税人要求延期交纳及少纳时，不外采取三种解决办法：一交滞纳金，二找保人，三送法院。有的科长检讨说：“我过去为了完成任务，到了每月快结束时，跑到会计科看看任务完成数；如没有完成时，就马上召集稽查员开会布置工作，并鼓励他们说，看谁查的多，罚的多。”至于该征的不征，不该征的反而征了的现象，也检讨出不少。还有的对商人解答问题不耐烦，动不动“你去问问东北人民政府去！”有的税局设了意见箱，但纳税人提了意见充耳不闻，该改的不改，自以为是，对违章案件的处理，有的科长由于过去领导上强调任务，并说对商人不能有片面的“仁政”观点；因此在处理商人偷漏税案件时，即表现犹豫，不罚或罚的少了，怕被批评有“仁政”观点，于是就干脆狠狠的罚他一下。所以有的商人反映说：“税局可了不起，抓着违章就罚。”
    以上这些情况，说明了该局领导干部及科、所长级的干部，在政策思想与作风上是存在着很多问题的。现该局正热烈展开全面检查工作，以便改进今后工作。
