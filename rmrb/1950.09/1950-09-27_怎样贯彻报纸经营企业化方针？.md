How to Implement the Enterprise Management Policy for Newspapers?
    Ma Jianmin
  I. New Developments in Newspaper Management over the Past Six Months
    During the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, our newspaper management suffered indescribable difficulties due to the division, blockade, destruction, and invasion by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. At that time, newspaper distribution was not timely, revenue could not be recovered, material supply was insufficient, and prices were unstable, resulting in serious losses in newspaper management. Taking the five newspapers in the North China region of Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shijiazhuang, and Chahar last year as an example, the losses amounted to more than 5.9 million catties of millet, which, according to the current contract system standard, could supply more than 45,000 people for a month. If we calculate the losses of newspapers nationwide, the figures would be even more staggering.
    After the establishment of the Central People's Government, the National News Administration presided over the National Newspaper Managers Conference in December last year, which decided on the policy of enterprise management for newspapers. Thanks to the active efforts and earnest implementation by newspaper staff across the country, newspaper management, like all other work nationwide, has shown a vigorous new look in the past six months. The loss-making situation of some newspapers has been fundamentally changed.
    In the North China region, out of the thirteen major public and private newspapers, including the People's Daily, nine newspapers, namely People's Daily, Xinmin Daily, Tianjin Daily, Progress Daily, Hebei Daily, Chahar Daily, Pingyuan Daily, Shanxi Daily, and Shijiazhuang Daily, had surpluses by the end of June, accounting for two-thirds of all newspapers. According to the financial statements from January to June, the other five newspapers that were still losing money also greatly reduced their losses. From January to May, the Workers' Daily reduced its deficit by 7% compared to the original budget, Pingyuan Daily reduced it by 27% from January to June, Guangming Daily reduced it by 38%, Tangshan Labor Daily reduced it by 28%, and Suiyuan Daily reduced it by 56.7%. In other regions, the Northeast Daily showed a surplus in June, and the Shandong Dazhong Daily, Fujian Daily, Henan Daily, and New Hunan Daily also showed surpluses. The Nanjing Xinhua Daily has also recently become self-sufficient, no longer receiving subsidies from the government. This situation is unprecedented not only before the Newspaper Managers Conference but also in our newspaper management since the Anti-Japanese War.
    The emergence of this new situation in the past six months proves that the New Democratic newspaper management can completely achieve the goal of reducing losses, eliminating losses, and becoming self-sufficient. The policy of "all public and private newspaper management nationwide must adopt and implement enterprise management," decided by the National Newspaper Managers Conference last December, is correct and fully achievable.
  II. Why Are Some Newspapers Able to Make a Profit or Reduce Losses?
    Why are some newspapers able to make a profit or reduce losses? This is primarily due to the national financial and economic unification and price stability. Without national financial and economic unification and price stability, this situation would not have arisen at all, or at least would have been very difficult to achieve. Price stability has made newspaper capital turnover flexible, management plans manageable, and cost accounting easy, creating the most solid foundation and excellent conditions for the enterprise management of newspapers. This point is very clear from the operating conditions of various newspapers in North China before and after price stabilization. In the first quarter of this year, prices were increased once in March, but only Tianjin Daily had a surplus. By the second quarter, after national price stabilization, prices were reduced once in May, but nine newspapers, namely People's Daily, Xinmin Daily, Tianjin Daily, Progress Daily, Hebei Daily, Chahar Daily, Pingyuan Daily, Shanxi Daily, and Shijiazhuang Daily, had surpluses. That is to say, the situation of only individual newspapers having surpluses before price stabilization has changed to the general situation of surpluses after price stabilization. This is the most important and typical example of how price stability has improved newspaper management.
    At the same time, the subjective efforts of various newspapers cannot be ignored. These efforts are manifested in the following aspects:
    1. Correctly Adjusting Subscription Rates: The so-called correct adjustment of subscription rates means taking into account both the purchasing power of readers and the cost of the newspaper, so as to carry out reproduction. In the past six months, all regions across the country have made different numbers of price increases and decreases based on this principle. Although there are still shortcomings in adjusting subscription rates, it is basically correct. In this way, the loss-making phenomenon caused by some newspapers' inability to recover even the cost of paper from subscription fees last year has been completely overcome. So we can say that correctly adjusting subscription rates is the most important factor in developing circulation and reducing losses.
    2. Paying Attention to Advertising: Advertising revenue generally occupies the second most important position in the income of various newspapers, after circulation revenue. In the past, we did not pay much attention to advertising in rural areas due to various limitations, and we did not fully understand the principle that advertising can still connect with the broad masses at the current stage. In the past six months, this situation has changed. Newspapers located in large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin go without saying, and many newspapers in small and medium-sized cities that used to not pay attention to advertising have also begun to pay attention to publishing advertisements that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods in appropriate positions. In this way, the proportion of advertising revenue in the total income of newspapers in various places has increased significantly. For example, the advertising revenue of the People's Daily accounted for only 9.24% of the total revenue in December last year. By June of this year, it had already accounted for 19.28% of the total revenue.
    The importance of advertising can also be seen from the comparison between advertising revenue and certain expenditures. The advertising revenue of the People's Daily from January to June can offset 64% of the printing, editing, sales, and management expenses during the same period. The advertising revenue of the Tianjin Daily from January to May can offset 124% of the printing, editing, sales, and management expenses during the same period. The advertising revenue of the Shijiazhuang Daily from January to June can offset 138% of the editing expenses.
    3. Implementing Streamlining and Thrift: The People's Daily Printing Factory had 140 employees in December last year, and it was reduced to 136 in July this year. The total number of employees of the Tianjin Daily in June decreased by 24.8% compared to November last year, and wage expenditures decreased by 18.6%. The Chahar Daily reduced its workers from the original 50 to 27, and proofreaders from the original 6 to 3. The number of circulation personnel did not increase, but the amount of work doubled. This is a case of reduced personnel and improved work efficiency. The material costs and printing costs of the People's Daily accounted for 66.56% and 15.56% of the total monthly expenditure in January, respectively, but fell to 65.5% and 8.83% in June. This is material saving and cost reduction. If we compare the printing, editing, sales, and management expenses of the three provincial newspapers in May with those in April, the Chahar Daily saved 26.31%, the Shanxi Daily saved 28.13%, and the Hebei Daily saved 10.74%. The paper consumption rate of military newspapers such as the North China Liberation Army Daily has also been reduced from 6 per thousand to 5.5 per thousand. There are many similar examples in other regions as well.
    4. Establishing Various Necessary Systems: In order to implement enterprise management, general newspapers have begun to establish various necessary systems, regulations, and methods, such as registration, statistics, monthly closing, budget and final accounts, machine maintenance regulations, and reward and saving methods. What was not available in the past is now available; what could not be calculated in the past can now be calculated; what could not be closed on time in the past can now be closed on time, and more accurately than before. The various newspapers in the North China region can also submit monthly statements to the National News Administration every month, unifying the accounting subjects. The establishment of various necessary systems, regulations, and methods, as well as summarizing the management situation on time, greatly helps various newspapers improve production, overcome waste, and study and improve work in a timely manner based on actual conditions.
    5. Adopting Domestic Paper: Paper is the most important material in newspaper management, and it used to account for more than 70% of the entire cost of the newspaper. In the past, in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, newspapers almost entirely used foreign paper. Now, all newspapers across the country, except for the original receipts and existing foreign paper, have begun to use domestic paper. In North China, paper purchase contracts have been signed twice with state-owned paper mills. Some newspapers in East China have also signed similar contracts with paper mills. Although domestic paper has higher costs and the quality is not good enough, signing paper purchase contracts can strengthen the relationship between paper production and sales, ensuring timely paper supply. Moreover, the paper price will not rise during the contract period; thus, the quotation can be stabilized on a relatively reasonable basis, and the newspaper can operate more confidently. This point has been deeply experienced by various newspapers in North China. Therefore, adopting domestic paper and signing paper purchase contracts with paper mills is not only beneficial to the development of the national paper industry but also beneficial to the newspaper's own management.
    6. Advancing Publication Time: The People's Daily has achieved the best results in this regard. In December last year, when the newspaper was distributed 91,000 copies, the manuscript was issued at 9:25 AM, the manuscript was completed at 3:20 PM, typesetting was completed at 4:00 PM, layout was completed at 5:00 PM, proofreading was completed at 5:35 PM, printing was approved at 5:42 PM, printing started at 6:30 PM, and printing was completed at 9:10 PM. What about in July this year? The newspaper was distributed more than 122,000 copies, and the entire time process was: the manuscript was issued at 8:30 AM, the manuscript was completed at 2:10 PM, typesetting was completed at 2:25 PM, layout was completed at 2:52 PM, proofreading was completed at 3:18 PM, printing was approved at 3:32 PM, printing started at 3:59 PM, and printing was completed at 5:52 PM. The publication time was advanced by 3 hours and 18 minutes. This has never happened in the People's Daily before. In this way, the newspaper can be delivered to readers throughout the city before 10:00 AM every day. The delivery time to other places has also been greatly advanced, generally by half a day to a day along the railway lines, which has been praised by the broad masses of readers, providing a strong guarantee for newspaper management, expanding subscribers, and consolidating subscribers.
    7. Implementing "Unified Postal Distribution": As of the end of July, according to available data, a total of 135 newspapers nationwide have implemented "unified postal distribution" and are distributed by the post office. And some newspapers are creating conditions in a planned and step-by-step manner, preparing to sign contracts with the post office. Distributed by the post office. In this way, on the one hand, it facilitates the distribution work, and on the other hand, it also ensures that the newspaper can receive the subscription fee in a timely manner, or implement a pre-collection system, so that the newspaper can actively control funds, which greatly facilitates enterprise management.
    8. Some newspapers have implemented democratic management very well, improving the creativity and enthusiasm of all employees, which is inseparable from the reduction of materials and supplies and the improvement of printing and publishing work efficiency. The Workers' Daily established a management committee in June and has achieved good results. For example, in July, the typesetting team exceeded the original plan by 16.6%, the letterpress printing team exceeded the quota by 18.4%, and the binding team completed 101.4% of the task. Within just half a month in June, 1,000 catties of coal were saved. Workers also invented a book-binding machine. The quantity and quality of various tasks have generally improved. Other newspapers such as the People's Daily and Chahar Daily also have many such examples.
    9. The newspaper appropriately organized the surplus productive forces to engage in sideline business, which also helped to improve the economic situation of various newspapers to a considerable extent.
  III. How to Implement the Enterprise Policy in the Future?
    The national newspaper management enterprise has made many achievements, which cannot be denied. But these achievements are not yet universal, in-depth, and solid, which is also undeniable. In the future, we should continue to implement the enterprise policy. How to implement this policy? In addition to continuing to consolidate and promote the existing achievements, we believe that the most important thing is:
    1. Eliminating Ideological Obstacles: Some people think that newspapers are cultural undertakings and cannot be operated as production undertakings. Some people think that newspaper management enterprise is only a matter for managers and has nothing to do with editors and reporters. Some people think that newspapers in large cities are easy to implement enterprise, but newspapers in small and medium-sized cities are not easy to implement. Or think that newspapers in small and medium-sized cities are easy to implement enterprise, but newspapers in large cities are not easy to implement. Even some people think that we have already been enterprises, and there is no problem in the future. It doesn't matter if all expenses are spent casually. Individual newspapers even still retain the idea of ​​reimbursing the public for how much they lose. All of these can hinder the implementation of newspaper management enterprises. To implement the enterprise policy, we must first eliminate these ideological obstacles.
    2. Strengthening Cost Accounting and Reducing Costs: Some newspapers have not yet stipulated the consumption standards for major equipment such as paper, ink, and lead materials, or the regulations are already in place but are extremely inaccurate. In some newspapers, printing, editing, sales, management and other expenses still account for 40% to 60% of the total cost, such a considerable proportion that should not exist. Some newspapers have not yet formulated a series of management systems on how to avoid the waste and damage of all labor and materials. For example, some newspapers waste 9 tons of paper invisibly every month due to unsuitable paper weight and size, which is equivalent to more than 100 million yuan in RMB at market prices. Similar more serious waste situations still exist more or less in newspapers in various places. In this way, it is impossible to accurately calculate costs and reduce costs. At the same time, it is impossible to make the newspaper more widely distributed, so as to better achieve its political tasks. Therefore, to implement the enterprise policy, we must strengthen cost accounting, improve the accounting organization and accounting system, especially the audit system. Mobilize the masses, launch a mass anti-waste struggle, and further reduce newspaper costs.
    3. Developing Circulation Work: The more newspapers are distributed, the greater the help to improve the cultural and political level of the masses. The people need to develop newspaper distribution work. The more newspapers are distributed, the more benefits there are to the development of postal services. The post office needs to develop newspaper distribution work. The more newspapers are distributed, the more costs can be reduced and the more newspaper revenue can be made, which is more conducive to enterprise. The newspaper itself needs to develop circulation work. From a political, economic, and cultural point of view, it is necessary to develop distribution work. It can be said that: in addition to improving the content first, the most important thing for a newspaper is how to most widely and universally develop distribution work. Some newspapers, such as the People's Daily and Northeast Daily, have increased their circulation, but some newspapers have not increased or even decreased their circulation. Even with the People's Daily, although the number of copies has increased, it is estimated that there are still about 500 counties across the country that cannot see it. This is such a serious phenomenon! Therefore, in order to better complete the political tasks of the newspaper and further implement the enterprise policy, various newspapers should conduct in-depth research and review of distribution work, formulate distribution plans based on specific conditions, and use all methods to fight for expanding the number of copies of the newspaper!

　　怎样贯彻报纸经营企业化方针？
    马健民
  一、半年来报纸经营所表现的新气象
    在抗日战争时期与解放战争时期，由于日本帝国主义及国民党反动派的分割、封锁、破坏、侵略，使我们的报纸经营遭到了难以形容的困难。那时，报纸发行不能及时，报价不能收回，材料供给不充裕，物价不稳定，因而造成报纸经营的严重亏损现象。仅以去年华北区天津、河北、山西、石家庄、察哈尔五个报纸来说，亏损数字即达五百九十余万斤小米，按现在包干制标准可供给四万五千余人一月之用。如将全国报纸亏损数字计算一下，那就更加惊人了。
    自中央人民政府成立后，由新闻总署主持，在去年十二月举行了全国报纸经理会议，决定了报纸经营企业化的方针。经全国各报工作人员积极努力，认真执行，半年多来，报纸经营已与全国一切其他工作一样，表现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。有些报纸的亏损现象，已有了根本改变。
    在华北区，连人民日报在内的十三家主要公私营报纸，截至六月底，已经有人民、新民、天津、进步、河北、察哈尔、平原、山西、石家庄等九家，即全部报纸三分之二可以有盈余了。其他五家仍旧赔钱的报纸，从一月至六月的决算看来，也大大缩小了亏损数字。计一至五月份工人日报较原预算赤字缩小百分之七，平原日报一至六月缩小百分之二十七，光明日报缩小百分之三十八，唐山劳动日报缩小百分之二十八，绥远日报缩小百分之五十六点七。在其他地区，东北日报六月份出现了盈余，山东大众日报、福建日报、河南日报、新湖南报都出现了盈余。南京新华日报也在最近做到自给自足，不再向政府领取补贴。这种情形，不但是报纸经理会议以前所没有，也是抗战以来，我们在报纸经营上所没有过的现象。
    半年来，这种新情况的出现，就证明了：新民主主义的报纸经营，是完全可以做到少赔钱、不赔钱而自给自足的。去年十二月全国报纸经理会议决定的“全国一切公私营报纸的经营，必须采取与贯彻企业化”的方针是正确的，完全可以做到的。
  二、有些报纸为什么能够盈余或减少赔损？
    有些报纸为什么能够盈余或减少赔损呢？这首先是由于全国财经统一与物价稳定。没有全国的财经统一与物价稳定，这种情形根本不会产生、或至少是很难产生的。由于物价稳定，使报社资金周转灵活，经营计划能够掌握，成本计算易于进行，给报纸经营企业化造成了最巩固的基础与优良条件。这一点，从华北各报物价稳定前后经营情况来看，是非常明显的。在今年第一季中，三月份曾加价一次，但有盈余的仅天津日报一家。到第二季全国物价稳定后，五月分曾减价一次，但有盈余的却已有人民、新民、天津、进步、河北、察哈尔、平原、山西、石家庄等九家了。这就是说，各报已改变物价稳定前仅个别有盈余的情况而为物价稳定后一般有盈余的情况了。这是物价稳定使报纸经营情况好转的最主要最典型的例证。
    同时，各报主观上积极努力也是不容忽视的。这些努力表现在以下各方面：
    一、正确的调整报价：所谓正确的调整报价，就是一方面照顾到读者购买力，一方面又照顾到报纸的成本，以便进行再生产。半年来，全国各区都根据这个原则，进行了不同次数的增价与减价。虽然在调整报价中还有缺点，但基本上是对的。这样，便完全克服了去年有些报社因报费收入连纸张成本都不能收回而产生的亏损现象。所以我们可以这样说：正确的调整报价，是开展发行同时也是减少赔损的最主要因素。
    二、注意刊登广告：广告收入一般除发行收入外，在各报收入中占着第二个重要地位。过去我们在农村，因各种条件所限，不很重视广告，对广告在目前阶段尚能联系广大群众的这个道理认识不足。半年来，这个情况转变了。处在大城市如北京上海天津的报纸自不用说，许多中小城市向来不重视广告的报纸，也开始注意到以适当地位刊登有益于国计民生的广告了。这样，各地报纸广告收入在其总收入的比重中就显著增加起来了。例如人民日报去年十二月广告收入不过占总收入百分之九点二四。今年六月，便已占总收入百分之十九点二八了。
    从广告收入与某项支出的比较上也可以看出他的重要性。人民日报一至六月份广告收入可抵同时期印刷、编辑、营业、管理四项费用的百分之六十四。天津日报一至五月份广告收入可抵同期印刷、编辑、营业、管理四项费用的百分之一百二十四。石家庄日报一至六月份广告收入可抵编辑费用的百分之一百三十八。
    三、实行精简节约：人民日报印刷厂去年十二月全部职工一四○人，今年七月减为一三六人，天津日报六月份职工总数较去年十一月份减少百分之二十四点八，工资支出减少百分之十八点六。察哈尔日报工人由原来五十人减为二十七人，校对由原来六人减到三人，发行人员未增加而工作增多一倍。这是人员减少而工作效率提高了。人民日报材料费用和印刷费用一月份各占全月总支出的百分之六十六点五六和百分之十五点五六，到六月份便降为百分之六十五点五和百分之八点八三。这是材料节省、成本减低了。如再以五月份三个省报印刷、编辑、营业、管理各项费用与四月份来比，那么，察哈尔日报节减了百分之二十六点三一，山西日报节减了百分之二十八点一三，河北日报节减了百分之十点七四。部队报纸如华北解放军报的纸张消耗率也由千分之六减为千分之五点五了。其他各区类似这样的例子也还有很多。
    四、建立了各种必要制度：为执行企业化经营，一般报纸都开始建立了各种必要的制度，条例和办法，如登记、统计、月结、预决算、机器保养条例、奖励节约办法等。过去没有的，现在有了；过去不会计算的，现在会了；过去不能按期结账的，现在能按期结账，并较从前精确了。华北区各报并能按月向新闻总署送交月结，统一了会计科目。各种必要制度、条例、办法的建立以及按期总结经营情况，对各报提高生产，克服浪费，根据实际情况及时研究与改进工作，帮助很大。
    五、采用国产纸张：纸张是报纸经营中最主要的材料，它在报纸整个成本中过去曾占百分之七十以上。过去在国民党统治区，报纸差不多是全部采用外国纸。现在全国各报，除原来接收及原存外纸外，均已开始采用国产纸，在华北曾两次与国营纸厂订立纸张合同。华东区有些报社也曾向纸厂订立了同样的合同。虽然国产纸成本较高，质量还不够好，但订立购纸合同，可以密切纸张产销双方的关系，保证纸张及时供应。并在合同期间，纸价不会上涨；因而能使报价稳定在比较合理的基础上，报社可以更安心经营。这一点，已为华北各报所深深体验到了。因此，采用国产纸与纸厂订立购纸合同，不但有益于全国造纸工业的发展，也有益于报纸本身的经营。
    六、提早出版时间：在这方面，人民日报的成绩最好。去年十二月，报纸发行九万一千份时，九点二十五分发稿，三点二十分齐稿，四点十分排完，五点拼完，五点三十五分校完，五点四十二分付印，六点半开印，九点十分印完。今年七月呢？报纸发行十二万二千余份，全部时间过程是：八点三十分发稿，两点十分齐稿，两点二十五分排完，两点五十二分拼完，三点十八分校完，三点三十二分付印，三点五十九分开印，五点五十二分印完，出版时间提早了三点十八分。这在人民日报是向来没有过的。这样，就使报纸能于每天上午十时前送到全市读者面前。外埠送达时间也大大提早，铁路沿线一般提早半天至一天，得到广大读者的赞许，给报纸经营、扩大订户、巩固订户以有力的保障。
    七、实行“邮发合一”：截至七月底已有材料，全国报纸在发行方面已实行“邮发合一”交邮局发行的，共计一百三十五家。并有一些报纸正在有计划有步骤的创造条件，准备与邮局订立合同。交邮局发行。这样，一方面便利了发行工作，一方面也保证报社能及时收到报费，或实行预收制度，使报社得以主动掌握资金，大大便利了企业化经营。
    八、有些报社很好的实行了民主管理，提高了全体职工的创造性和积极性，这对各报材料物料的减省，印刷出版工作效率提高等方面有密不可分的关系。工人日报自六月份起成立了管委会，已得到了很好的成绩。如七月份排字股超过原计划百分之十六点六，铅印股超过定额百分之十八点四，装订股平装完成任务的百分之一百零一点四。六月份内仅仅半个月就节省了煤一千斤。工人还发明了捆书机。各种工作的数量与质量一般都提高了。其他如人民日报、察哈尔日报也有不少这种例子。
    九、报社适当的组织了剩余生产力，从事于副业经营，这也相当的帮助了各报经济情况的改善。
  三、今后如何贯彻企业化方针？
    全国报纸经营企业化已有许多成绩，这是不容否认的。但这些成绩还不够普遍、深入和巩固，这也是不可否认的。今后还应继续贯彻企业化方针，怎样贯彻这个方针呢？除了仍旧继续巩固和发扬已有的各种成绩外，我们以为最主要的是：
    一、肃清思想上的障碍：有人认为报纸是文化事业，不能当作生产事业来经营。有人认为报纸经营企业化只是经理人员的事与编辑记者无关。有人认为大城市报纸容易实行企业化，中小城市不易实行。或认为中小城市报纸容易实行企业化，大城市报纸不易实行。更有的认为我们已经企业化了，今后没有问题了，一切开支随便点也不算什么。个别报社甚至还残存着赔多少向公家报销多少的思想。所有这些，都能阻碍报纸经营企业化的进行。贯彻企业化的方针，必须首先肃清这些思想上的障碍。
    二、加强成本计算，减低成本：有些报社对于主要器材如纸张、油墨、铅料等消耗标准尚无规定，或已有规定但极不精确。有些报社印刷、编辑、营业、管理等费用在整个成本中还占着百分之四十至百分之六十等不应有的相当大的比重。有些报社对如何避免一切工料的浪费与损坏，尚未定出一系列的管理制度。例如有的报社因纸张重量尺寸不适合，每月便无形中浪费九吨纸，按市价折合人民币一亿余元。类此比较严重的浪费情形，各地报社或多或少的还存在着。这样，就不可能精确计算成本，减低成本。同时也就不可能使报纸发行更多更广，以便更好地达到它的政治任务。因此，贯彻企业化方针，必须加强成本计算，健全会计组织会计制度，特别是审核制度。发动群众，开展群众性的反浪费斗争，进一步减低报纸成本。
    三、开展发行工作：报纸发行越多，对群众文化政治水平的提高帮助越大，人民需要开展报纸的发行工作。报纸发行越多，对邮局业务的发展好处越多，邮政局需要开展报纸的发行工作。报纸发行越多，越能减低成本使报纸收入越多，越有利于企业化，报社本身更需要开展发行工作。不论从政治的经济的文化的意义上来讲，都必须开展发行工作。可以说：一个报纸除了首先改进内容以外，最主要的就是如何最广泛地最普遍地开展发行工作了。有些报纸如人民日报、东北日报发行数量增加了，但有些报纸发行数目并未增加甚至减少了。即以人民日报而论，虽然发行数目增多了，但估计全国尚有五百个左右的县看不到，这是多么严重的现象！因此，为了更好地完成报纸的政治任务与进一步贯彻企业化方针，各报应深入研究与检讨发行工作，根据具体条件，制定发行计划，用尽一切方法，为扩大报纸的发行数量而斗争！
