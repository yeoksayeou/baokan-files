　　To Further Implement the Safety in Production Policy
    Northeast Coal Mines Conduct Autumn Safety Inspection
    [Shenyang News] According to the Northeast Daily, the Northeast Coal Mine Administration held a meeting on September 4th with the directors and safety engineering section chiefs of its affiliated mining bureaus to arrange for the autumn safety inspection.

    The meeting considered that although safety work in Northeast coal mines had improved, the problems remained very serious. For example, comparing the first eight months of this year with the same period last year, the total number of accidents decreased by 35 percent, the number of deaths decreased by 38 percent, and the total number of minor and serious injuries decreased by 16 percent; however, accidents caused by negligence have not been fundamentally eliminated, and casualties are still extremely serious. According to statistics, accidents caused by roof collapses and gas explosions accounted for 30 percent of the total number of accidents, 74 percent of the total number of deaths, and 36 percent of the total number of minor and serious injuries.

    In order to eliminate accidents caused by negligence and realize the policy of safety in production, the meeting emphasized that it is necessary to resolutely implement the new coal mining methods and safety regulations, strengthen roof management and protection, strengthen ventilation, establish sound inspection organizations, and conduct regular inspections. These are effective ways to improve safety work and prevent roof collapses and gas explosions. In this inspection, each bureau, mine, and pit leader is required to personally lead and organize a core team, and mobilize the broad masses to conduct a detailed autumn safety inspection; the inspection work should be linked with fire prevention, theft prevention, and prevention of special incidents; timely publicity and education should be carried out to raise the vigilance of all employees, and models who abide by operating procedures should be rewarded. The meeting also stipulated that the main inspections inside the pits are roof management, ventilation conditions, and equipment; outside the pits, the inspections are of various warehouses and safety equipment. The inspection period is from September 10th to 25th. The Coal Mine Administration will also organize inspection teams to conduct key inspections in the mining areas.

　　进一步贯彻安全生产方针
    东北煤矿举行秋季保安大检查
    【沈阳讯】据东北日报消息：东北煤矿管理局于九月四日召开所属各矿务局局长及保工科长会议，布置秋季保安大检查。
    会议认为：东北煤矿保安工作虽有好转，但问题仍很严重。如以今年八个月和去年同时期比较，事故总次数虽减少了百分之三十五，死亡人数减少百分之三十八，轻重伤总人数减少百分之十六；但责任事故还没有基本消灭，伤亡仍极严重。据统计：由于冒顶和瓦斯爆发发生的事故，占总事故次数的百分之三十，占死亡总数的百分之七十四，占轻重伤总数的百分之三十六。
    为消灭责任事故，实现安全生产的方针，会议强调指出：必须坚决贯彻新采煤法和保安规程，加强顶板的管理与保护，加强通风，建立健全的检查组织机构，进行经常的检查，是改进保安工作、防止冒顶和瓦斯爆炸的有效办法。在此次检查中，则要求各局、矿、坑长应亲自领导，组织核心组，并发动广大群众细致的进行秋季保安大检查；要使检查工作与防火、防盗、防特等工作联系起来；要及时进行宣传教育，以提高全体职工的警惕，对遵守操作规程的模范应给予奖励。会议并规定：在坑内主要是检查顶板管理，通风状况及设备；坑外是检查各种仓库及保安设备。检查的时间系由九月十日至二十五日。煤矿管理局亦将组织检查团到矿区作重点检查。
