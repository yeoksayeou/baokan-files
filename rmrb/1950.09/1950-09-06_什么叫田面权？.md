　　What is Field Surface Right?
Editor:
    The Land Reform Law mentions Field Surface Right. What is Field Surface Right?
    Zhangjiakou City Water Company Li Zhanshan

Comrade Li Zhanshan:
    Field Surface Right is the same as Perpetual Tenancy Right, which means that tenant farmers have the permanent right to cultivate the land of landlords. These tenant farmers are called Perpetual Tenants, and this type of tenancy relationship is called Perpetual Tenancy System. Its characteristic is that the land ownership is divided into two parts, one called "Field Bottom" and the other called "Field Surface"; the landlord owns the Field Bottom Right and collects rent from the farmers, while the farmers own the Field Surface Right and can cultivate it forever.
    The Perpetual Tenancy System is more common in the rural areas of southeastern provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. It is most prevalent in Wu County, Wujiang, Changshu, Songjiang, and other counties in Jiangsu, accounting for more than 80% of all tenanted land. It is also quite common in the Jiaxing area of Zhejiang; it is more popular in southern Anhui than in northern Anhui; the Perpetual Tenancy System also exists in Yingshan, Xishui, Echeng, Macheng, and other counties in Hubei.
    The names for Perpetual Tenancy System vary from place to place. In southern Jiangsu it is called Field Surface Right, and in Zhejiang it has names such as Small Industry Field, Small Bought Field, Guest Field, and Perpetual Small Operation Right.
    The sources of Field Surface Right and the reasons for its particular development in the Jiangnan region: (1) The influence of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's land policy forced landlords to transfer Field Surface Rights to farmers. (2) During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period, due to years of war, the land was barren, and landlords recruited people to cultivate it, allowing farmers to have Perpetual Tenancy Rights. (3) Farmers could not repay their debts and sold the land to landlords at a low price, but retained the Field Surface Right to cultivate. (4) Bought the Field Surface Right from the landlord. (5) Derived from reclaiming wasteland owned by landlords.
    Farmers enjoy Perpetual Tenancy Rights, which is more stable than general tenancy relationships, and tenant farmers can cultivate with more peace of mind, which is a good thing. However, the use of land with Perpetual Tenancy Rights by farmers is not unconditional. When farmers are unable to pay rent to the landlord, and the rent arrears approach or exceed the price of the Field Surface Right, the landlord can often directly or through so-called "legal procedures" encroach on the farmer's right to use the land. Article 846 of the reactionary Kuomintang government's Civil Code stipulates: "If a Perpetual Tenant owes a total of two years' rent, the landowner may, unless otherwise customary, evict the tenant." After eviction, the two years' rent arrears must still be recovered. Farmers can buy and sell tenancy rights, but "Perpetual Tenants shall not lease the land to others" (Pseudo-Civil Code Article 845). The rent paid by farmers with Perpetual Tenancy Rights is usually about one-third less than general rent. However, it is not easy for farmers to buy Perpetual Tenancy Rights from landlords. According to a rural survey in Taicang, Jiangsu, cited by the Shanghai Jiefang Daily on July 31, the price at which farmers in that county bought Perpetual Tenancy Rights from landlords was generally two-thirds of the total value of the land. From these circumstances, the so-called Perpetual Tenancy Right is just a way for the landlord class to exploit farmers.

### 什么叫田面权？

　　什么叫田面权？编辑同志：
    土地改革法中提到田面权，请问什么叫田面权？
    张家口市自来水公司  李占山李占山同志：
    田面权就是永佃权，即佃农对地主土地有永久耕种之权。这种佃农叫永佃农；这类租佃关系叫永佃制。其特点是将土地所有权分为两部分，一称“田底”，一称“田面”；地主占有田底权向农民收租，农民占有田面权可以永远耕种。
    永佃制在东南各省如江、浙、闽、粤的农村中较为普遍。江苏的吴县、吴江、常熟、松江等县最盛，约占全部佃耕地的百分之八十以上。浙江嘉兴专区亦相当普遍；安徽南部较北部流行；湖北的英山、浠水、鄂城、麻城等县也有这种永佃制。
    永佃制各个地方称呼不一、江苏南部叫田面权，浙江有小业田、小买田、客田、永小作权等名称。
    田面权的来源及其在江南地区特别发达的原因：（一）太平天国土地政策的影响，地主被迫把田面权让与农民。（二）太平天国时，因连年战争，土地荒芜，地主招人垦种，允许农民有永佃权。（三）农民负债无法偿还，将土地廉价出卖给地主，但保留田面耕种。（四）向地主买得田面权。（五）从开垦地主所有之生荒土地中得来。
    农民享有永佃权，较一般的租佃关系为安定，佃农可以比较安心的进行耕作，这是好的一面。但农民对永佃权土地的使用，也不是无条件的。当农民无力向地主交租、欠租接近或超过田面权的价格时，地主常常可以直接或经过所谓“法律手续”，侵夺农民对土地的使用权。国民党反动政府所订民法第八百四十六条即规定：“永佃权人积欠地租达二年之总额者，除另有习惯外，土地所有人得撤佃。”撤佃后尚须追缴这两年的欠租。农民可以买卖佃权，但“永佃权人不得将土地出租于他人”（伪民法第八百四十五条）。享有永佃权的农民所交租额，通常较一般地租约少三分之一。但农民从地主手上买到永佃权，是不容易的。据七月三十一日上海解放日报所引江苏太仓农村调查：该县农民向地主买得永佃权的价格，一般为该土地总值的三分之二。从这些情况看来，所谓永佃权，不过是地主阶级剥削农民的一种方式而已。
