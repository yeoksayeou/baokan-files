Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The US-British imperialist bloc has recently intensified its aggressive activities in the Near East and Middle East, attempting to turn the region into a military base for launching wars of aggression. In early August, two batches of US government Marines sent to Iran to "protect its diplomatic missions" arrived in Tehran. The Egyptian newspaper *Misr* revealed that the US and Britain recently sent notes to the Syrian government, insisting that a strategic railway and highway must be built from the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, through Syria to Iran, Turkey, and directly to the Soviet border, "to facilitate the transportation of war materials from the Mediterranean region to Iran." Meanwhile, according to a TASS report from Tehran, the US government recently requested to send 500 American "experts" to Iran. When the Iranian government declined this suggestion, the Americans suggested that the US fund the dispatch of 200 "American agricultural operators and agricultural experts" to Iran to "cooperate" with farmers. US Supreme Court Justice William Douglas also went to Iran for activities. After "visiting" several cities, he also "climbed the mountains of Azerbaijan" with several American agents. In eastern Turkey, the United States has built several new airports. In Saudi Arabia, Israel, Lebanon, Transjordan, and other countries, the United States is also strengthening the intrusion of its military and economic forces.

The intensification of US imperialist aggressive activities in the Near East and Middle East is closely related to the action of US Army Chief of Staff Collins, who personally planned war preparations in Iran and Turkey in March. After returning home, Collins openly declared at a press conference that the US aggressive activities in the Middle East should pay special attention to Iran, Turkey, and Greece, which are close to the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries.

According to Israel's *Al HaMishmar* newspaper, according to the general plan formulated by the military staff departments of the Atlantic aggressive bloc countries regarding the division of the Near East and Middle East into strategic zones of Western countries, the United States was assigned the regions of Greece, Turkey, and Iran, and Britain was assigned the Arab countries. Currently, Britain's main conspiracy is to strengthen its military strength in the Suez Canal region, send more troops and weapons to Iraq, and send a large number of aircraft to the British air base in Habbaniyah (west of Baghdad).

The actions of the US-British imperialist bloc in intensifying its aggression against the Near East and Middle East countries have aroused strong resistance from the people of the region. In recent months, the people of the Near East and Middle East countries have held thousands of mass demonstrations and strikes to protest the aggressive acts of the US-British imperialist bloc. The movement for peace has been launched enthusiastically. As of September 6, 110,000 people in Syria and 82,000 people in Lebanon had signed the peace declaration.

　　美英加紧侵略近东中东引起各国人民强烈抗议
    【新华社二十日讯】美英帝国主义集团最近加紧在近东与中东各国进行侵略活动，力图将该地区变为发动侵略战争的军事基地。八月初，美国政府两批派往伊朗“保护其外交机关”的海军陆战队，抵达了德黑兰。埃及《密斯里报》透露：美英两国最近曾照会叙利亚政府，坚持必须修筑自地中海东岸穿过叙利亚至伊朗、土耳其，直达苏联边境的战略铁路和公路，“俾便于自地中海地区运送战争物资至伊朗”。同时，据塔斯社德黑兰消息：美国政府最近要求派遣五百个美国“专家”到伊朗去。当伊朗政府谢绝了该项建议时，美国人就建议由美国出资遣送两百名“美国农业经营家和农业专家”到伊朗去与农民“合作”。美国最高法院法官威廉·道格拉斯也到伊朗去活动。他在“访问”了若干城市以后，并与若干美国特务“攀登阿塞拜疆大山”。在土耳其东部，美国已修筑了若干新的飞机场。在沙特阿拉伯、以色列、黎巴嫩、外约旦等国，美国亦正在加强其军事与经济势力的侵入。
    美帝国主义在近东、中东侵略活动的加紧，与美国陆军参谋长柯林斯于三月间到伊、土两国亲自策划备战措施的行动，有密切关系。柯林斯在返国后于记者招待会上曾公然宣称：美国在中东的侵略活动，应特别注意与苏联及东欧人民民主国家接近的伊朗、土耳其和希腊。
    据以色列的《阿尔·哈米斯马尔》报透露，根据大西洋侵略集团各国军事参谋部所拟定的、关于将近东与中东瓜分为西方国家之战略区的总计划，美国分得希腊、土耳其与伊朗等地区，英国分得阿拉伯国家。目前，英国主要的阴谋是加强苏彝士运河地区的军力，并加送军队和武器到伊拉克，增派大批飞机到英国在哈班尼亚（巴格达以西）的空军基地。
    美英帝国主义集团加紧侵略近东和中东各国的行动，已引起该地区人民的强烈反抗。近数月来，近东和中东各国人民曾举行了几千次的群众示威游行和罢工，抗议美英帝国主义集团的侵略行径。争取和平运动已经热烈地展开。截至九月六日为止，叙利亚已有十一万人、黎巴嫩也有八万二千人在和平宣言上签了名。
