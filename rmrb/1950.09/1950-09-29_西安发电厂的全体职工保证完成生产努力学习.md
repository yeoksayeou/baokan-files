　　All Employees of Xi'an Power Plant Pledge to Complete Production and Study Hard
    [This Newspaper Xi'an News] All employees of the Xi'an Power Plant of the Northwest Electric Power Bureau wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting their production and study situation. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    We are the employees of the Xi'an Power Plant of the Northwest Electric Power Bureau. We are taking advantage of the Northwest Labor Model Representatives coming to Beijing to bring you a letter, reporting to you the situation of our employees defending peace and production competition. In order to celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are exerting the power of the working class to guarantee the sending of electricity, guarantee that no responsibility accidents and error accidents occur, and at the same time, under the principle of saving labor and materials, we will strive to over fulfill our production tasks. We are now brewing the signing of the fourth quarter production collective contract to welcome the first anniversary National Day, which more powerfully increases our confidence in production guarantees.
    Chairman Mao: We are not only like this in production, but also in learning. Now our employees have organized political classes, technical classes, and literacy classes in their spare time. The comrades who teach guarantee to teach well, and the comrades who learn guarantee not to be late or leave early, and must learn. Under this circumstance, everyone's political, technical, and cultural levels are constantly improving.
    In the peace signature campaign, all our employees, including family members, signed their names. If the American war-mongers dare to launch a war, the iron fists of the people will smash them to pieces. Respectfully wishing you good health.
          All Employees of Xi'an Power Plant of Northwest Electric Power Management Bureau
                September 15th

　　西安发电厂的全体职工保证完成生产努力学习
    【本报西安讯】西北电业总局西安发电厂全体职工上书毛主席，报告他们的生产及学习情形，原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们是西北电业总局西安发电厂的职工，我们趁着西北劳模代表同志来北京，顺便带给您一封信，把我们职工保卫和平，生产竞赛的情形来报告您。我们为了庆祝中华人民共和国诞生的第一周年纪念，我们发挥着工人阶级的力量来保证发送电力，保证不发生任何责任事故与差误事故，同时在省工省料的原则下还要争取超额完成我们的生产任务。现在我们正酝酿着签订第四季的生产集体合同，来迎接第一周年国庆日，这更有力地增加了我们在生产上的保证信心。
    毛主席：我们不但在生产上这样，在学习上也一样，现在我们职工在业余组织了政治班、技术班、识字班，教的同志保证教会，学的同志保证不迟到早退，要学会。在这种情形下，大家的政治、技术、文化都不断地在提高。
    在和平签名运动中，我们全厂职工连眷属都签了名。美国战争贩子如胆敢发动战争，人民铁的拳头，将要把它打得粉碎。敬祝您身体健康
          西北电业管理总局西安发电厂全体职工上
                九月十五日
