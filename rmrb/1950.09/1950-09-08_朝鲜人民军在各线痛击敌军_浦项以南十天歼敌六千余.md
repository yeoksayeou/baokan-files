Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a battle report on the morning of the 6th that the People's Army troops on all fronts repelled the counter-attacking enemy forces and continued to launch courageous offensive battles.

The People's Army troops advancing in the South Sea area met the enemy infantry forces, under the cover of tank units, which invaded our rear in an attempt to block our army's advance, and dealt them a fierce blow. As a result, over 400 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and over 30 tanks, over 20 vehicles, and other large quantities of war booty were seized.

The People's Army troops on the east coast shot down two American bombers.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a battle report on the evening of the 6th that the People's Army troops advancing south of Gunwi gave the counter-attacking enemy a devastating blow, killing or wounding over 200 enemies, capturing over 100 enemies, and seizing a large amount of military supplies such as mortars, heavy machine guns, light machine guns, radios, and ammunition, and are continuing to advance south.

The People's Army troops, continuing to advance after liberating Waegwan, fiercely attacked the stubborn enemies northwest of Daegu, inflicting heavy losses on them. In the battles in that area, the People's Army troops killed or wounded over 500 enemies, captured over 100 enemies, and seized a large amount of war booty such as 11 rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, light machine guns, various shells, and radios.

The People's Army troops, continuing to attack on the east coast, gave a devastating blow to the enemies south of Pohang, who, with the support of aircraft and tanks, stubbornly resisted relying on solid defensive positions, causing the Rhee Syngman puppet army's 3rd and 4th divisions operating in that area to suffer fatal losses, abandon many positions, and retreat completely.

In the recent ten days, in the battles south of Pohang, the People's Army troops killed or wounded over 6,000 enemy soldiers, captured over 500 enemies, and seized 12 tanks, 15 mortars, 6 rocket launchers, 40 heavy machine guns, 25 light machine guns, over 300 automatic rifles, over 400 rifles, over 300 carbines, and other large quantities of weapons and ammunition. The People's Army troops in that area have now penetrated deep into the enemy's defense line and are continuing to carry out fierce offensive battles.

The Rhee Syngman traitorous clique, defeated on all fronts, is panicking and forcibly conscripting young men and teenagers to the front lines, and under the name of so-called "women's teams," is forcibly conscripting young women, girls, and female students to form "front-line comfort teams" to satisfy the lust of American and Rhee Syngman puppet army officers.
