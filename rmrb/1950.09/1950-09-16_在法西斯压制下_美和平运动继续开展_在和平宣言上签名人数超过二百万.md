　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th—Despite the American reactionaries' all-out warmongering and intensified suppression of activities demanding peace, the American people's movement to defend peace has been developing rapidly since the outbreak of the Korean War. According to a report from the Telecommunications Agency: The American Peace Promotion Station in New York reported that the number of people who have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal in the United States has exceeded two million, more than three times the number at the start of the Korean War.

　　Although Truman has repeatedly emphasized the "necessity" of continuing the Korean War, a joint statement recently issued by thirty-nine faculty members of the University of Chicago demands that Truman "do everything possible to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean conflict." The Chicago "American Committee Against Militarization" and other mass organizations have also issued similar appeals.

　　At the same time, opposition to and protests against the suppression of peace activists are increasingly forming a broad movement. Seventy prominent Americans recently wrote to Truman and the mayors of 192 cities across the country, demanding that "immediate action be taken to deal with those who seek to interfere with the right to petition and the right to advocate for peace through speech and action." They include educators, scientists, missionaries, writers, farmers, and historians.

　　A group of pastors in New York, led by Congregationalist pastor Middaugh, formed a "Committee to Restore the Right of Public Assembly for Peace Groups" because the mayor prohibited them from holding peace rallies in the square. They issued a statement saying: "We cannot tolerate a situation where peace has become heresy and advocating for peace is denounced as a crime." This statement reflects the increasingly strong feelings among millions of progressive Americans.

　　在法西斯压制下
    美和平运动继续开展
    在和平宣言上签名人数超过二百万
    【新华社十四日讯】不顾美国反动派全力鼓吹战争并加紧压制要求和平的活动，美国人民保卫和平的运动自朝鲜战争爆发以来，仍获得迅速的发展。据电通社消息：据纽约美国和平宣传站报告：全美在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名的人数已超过二百万。较朝鲜战争开始时增加了三倍有余。
    尽管杜鲁门反复力陈继续朝鲜战争的“必要”，芝加哥大学教职员三十九人新近发表的联合声明，却要求杜鲁门“尽一切办法觅致和平解决朝鲜冲突”。芝加哥“美国反对军国主义化委员会”及其他群众团体也发表类似的呼吁。
    同时，对压制和平战士活动的反对与抗议，也正日益形成广泛的运动。美国各界名流七十人曾于最近致书杜鲁门及全国一百九十二个城市的市长，要求“立刻采取行动，以对付那些企图干涉请愿权利和以言论行动争取和平之权利的人们”。他们中间包括教育家、科学家、传教士、作家、农业家与历史家。
    纽约一个由公理会牧师密达尔领导的牧师团体，因为市长禁止他们在广场上举行和平集会，特成立了一个“恢复和平团体公开集会权委员会”。他们发表声明称：“和平变成了异端，拥护和平被当作犯罪检举，这种情况我们不能忍受下去。”这个声明反映了千百万美国进步人民中愈来愈强烈的感觉。
