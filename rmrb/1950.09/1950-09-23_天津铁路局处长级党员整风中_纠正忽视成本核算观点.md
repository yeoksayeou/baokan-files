The Tianjin Railway Bureau's Cadre-Level Party Members Rectification Campaign:
Correcting the Viewpoint of Neglecting Cost Accounting

[This newspaper's Tianjin dispatch] On the basis of the anti-bureaucracy movement in June and July, the Tianjin Railway Bureau concluded the rectification work of cadre-level Party members from August 17th to 31st. This rectification by the bureau adopted the method of combining top-down and bottom-up inspection and summary of work, and resolving important issues in the current work. The main gains in this phase of rectification were: the initial establishment of a cost perspective from the inspection of business guiding ideology; and further clarification of the mass line from the inspection of the guiding ideology of the workers' movement. The bureau will apply the experience of this stage to the rectification of non-Party cadres and all road section chiefs, and it is expected to complete the rectification work of the entire railway before the winter transportation period.

Checking business guiding ideology was the main issue in this phase of the bureau's rectification. The Tianjin Railway Bureau's business policy over the past year and a half has been correct. The entire railway has generally attached importance to completing tasks and improving efficiency. However, the most important cost perspective in railway business has not been universally established among cadre-level Party members, resulting in significant losses in railway work. The issue of establishing economic accounting has been raised by the leadership four times since last November, but overall progress has been limited. The reason for this is that some problems still exist in the thinking of cadres: (1) Many cadres believe that there is no way or experience, and ask the leadership to provide a set of ready-made experiences and methods; they have not clearly realized that this is a new system and should explore experience from creation and experimentation. (2) Some comrades have a purely efficiency-oriented view, taking improving efficiency as the only way to reduce costs. Sometimes efficiency conflicts with cost; in order to improve the daily car mileage, they do not hesitate to run single locomotives, and to shorten the turnaround time of freight cars, they do not hesitate to hang fewer cars and pull fewer tons of goods; they have not thought that efficiency needs to be consolidated when it is improved to a certain level, and when efficiency and cost conflict, cost should be taken into account. (3) Individual comrades have a purely task-oriented view and do not know that running a railway should make a profit, and there is a strong supply system and official-run ideology, dislike the trouble of cost accounting, and even feel disgusted. (4) Some comrades believe that various conditions must be created to implement the cost accounting system: such as production quotas, timing, fixed materials, fixed personnel, depreciation, uniform depreciation of waste materials, etc. Some people also emphasize that assets are not registered, depreciation cannot be calculated, and cost calculation is difficult, but they have not considered more about how to solve these problems. (5) The leadership has not provided enough education and specific assistance to the cadres, leaving them to their own devices. Currently, the bureau's situation is: improving efficiency has completed the standards required for the whole year, and establishing cost accounting will become the main key to future business development. After this rectification, the understanding of this issue by cadre-level cadres has been generally improved, laying a good ideological foundation for the establishment of an economic accounting system in the future.

On the issue of guiding ideology for the workers' movement, it was found that although the orientation towards production in the past year has been correct, the thinking of relying on and caring for the masses is not clear. Trade union cadres do not pay enough attention to security work and workers' health, and do not deeply understand the workers' ideological situation and demands. As a result, to some extent, it has hindered the workers' enthusiasm for labor.

### 天津铁路局处长级党员整风中  纠正忽视成本核算观点

　　天津铁路局处长级党员整风中
    纠正忽视成本核算观点
    【本报天津讯】天津铁路局在六、七两个月的反官僚主义运动的基础上，自八月十七日起至三十一日止，结束了党员处长级干部的整风工作。该局这次整风采取自上而下和自下而上相结合地检查总结工作，解决当前工作中的重要问题的方式。这一段整风中主要的收获是：从检查业务指导思想中初步建立了成本观点；从检查职工运动指导思想中进一步明确了依靠群众观点。该局将以这一阶段的经验，应用到非党处长和全路科段长的整风中，预计在冬运之前结束全路的整风工作。
    检查业务指导思想问题是该局这一阶段整风中的主要问题。天津铁路局领导上一年半以来的业务方针是正确的。全路已普遍重视完成任务和提高效能。铁路业务中最主要的成本观点，在党员处长级干部中还没有普遍建立，致使铁路工作遭受很大损失。建立经济核算问题，自去年十一月起，领导上已先后提出四次，但总的讲来成绩不大。其原因是干部思想上还存在一些问题：（一）许多干部认为没有办法、没有经验，要求领导上给一套现成的经验办法；他们没有明确认识这是新的制度，应该从创造与试验中摸索经验。（二）有些同志有单纯的效能观点，把提高效能作为减低成本的唯一办法，有时效能却与成本发生矛盾，为了提高日车公里便不惜跑单机，为缩短货车周转时间不惜少挂几个车皮，少拉几吨货；没有想到效能提高到一定程度时需要巩固，效能与成本矛盾时应该照顾成本。（三）个别同志有单纯任务观点，不知道办铁路应该获取利润，而存在着浓厚的供给制及官办思想，嫌成本核算麻烦，甚至起反感。（四）有些同志认为须要创造各种条件才能贯彻成本核算制：如生产定额、定时、定料、定员、折旧费、废旧料的统一折价等等。也有人强调资产未登记、折旧费算不出，算成本困难等，但是却没有更多考虑怎样解决这些问题。（五）领导上对干部的教育与具体帮助不够，任其自流。目前该局情况是：提高效能已完成全年所要求的标准，建立成本核算将成为今后业务发展的主要关键。经过这次整风，处长级干部对此问题的认识已普遍提高，为今后的建立经济核算制打下了良好的思想基础。
    在职工运动指导思想问题上，检查出一年以来面向生产方针固然正确，但是依靠群众关心群众的思想不明确。工会干部对保安工作与工人健康关心不够，未深入了解工人的思想情况和要求。因之在某种程度上阻碍了工人劳动积极性的发挥。
