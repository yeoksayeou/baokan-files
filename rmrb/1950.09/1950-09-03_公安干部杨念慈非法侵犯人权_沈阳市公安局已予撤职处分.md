Public Security Cadre Yang Nianci Illegally Infringed Upon Human Rights
　　Shenyang Public Security Bureau Has Already Given Him a Dismissal Punishment
　　Comrade Yang Nianci was a member of the Chinese Communist Party, serving as the Deputy Chief of the Public Security Administration Section of the Beishi District Branch of the Shenyang Public Security Bureau. At around 5:00 PM on June 23rd, he was wearing plain clothes and took a trolleybus to the hospital for treatment. After boarding, he stood by the trolley door. At the same time, a citizen named Wang Zhendong also boarded the bus. Wang, being drunk, accidentally stepped on Yang's white shoes. Yang punched Wang, and Wang returned a punch. A dispute ensued. Yang claimed that Wang had taken his bag, immediately produced his ID card, pulled Wang off the trolley, and took him to the branch office. Wang Zhendong refused to comply, and the two wrestled on the street. At this time, traffic police arrived, and Yang ordered them to assist in bringing Wang to the branch office, ordering two guard soldiers to tie Wang up in the backyard. After slapping Wang a few times, he called three more soldiers to beat him. Some soldiers were hesitant to hit him, and he said, "Hit him, it's okay, I'll take responsibility if he dies." After the soldiers finished beating him, they put two pairs of shackles and one pair of handcuffs on Wang and locked him up. In the evening, he privately took Wang to his dormitory for illegal interrogation, asking how many times Wang had robbed and stolen. When Wang denied it, he slapped Wang a few more times and locked him up again. After Bureau Chief Yang of the branch office learned about this, he immediately investigated the matter and sent people to investigate. It was found that Wang Zhendong had not committed any theft on the trolleybus. Wang was immediately released, and an explanation and apology were given to him. Yang Nianci arbitrarily detained and interrogated good people, oppressed the masses, and infringed upon human rights, seriously undermining policy and law. In addition to confining Yang Nianci for reflection, the Shenyang Public Security Bureau has also given him a dismissal punishment. At the same time, a circular was issued to all subordinates to carry out communication and launch a struggle against privileged thinking and warlordism.

　　公安干部杨念慈非法侵犯人权
    沈阳市公安局已予撤职处分
    杨念慈同志是中共党员，任沈阳市公安局北市区分局治安行政股副股长。六月二十三日下午五时许，他穿着便衣乘电车赴医院治病，上车后站在车门口。当时有市民王振东也同时上车，王因酒醉不慎，将他的白鞋踩了一脚，杨打了王一拳，王亦还了一拳。于是双方争执起来。杨说王掏了他的包，当即取出自己的身份证，将王拉下电车，带往分局。王振东不服，两人便在街头撕扭着。这时交通警赶到，杨便令他们协助把王带到分局，并令警卫战士两名将王绑在后院。他打了王几个嘴巴后，又叫三名战士来打。有的战士不敢打，他即说：“打，没关系，打死了由我负责。”战士打完后给王带上两付脚镣一付手铐，押起来。晚上，他私将王提到宿舍非法审讯，问王抢过几次偷过几次。王不承认，他又打了王几个嘴巴，又把他押起来。分局杨局长知道后，立即追究此事，并派人调查，查明王振东在车上并无行窃事实，即将王释放并向他解释道歉。杨念慈随便拘捕刑讯好人，欺压群众，侵犯人权，严重破坏政策法纪。沈阳市公安局除将杨念慈禁闭反省外，并予撤职处分。同时，通令所属进行传达，开展反特权思想与军阀主义的斗争。
