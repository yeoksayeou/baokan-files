Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 5th: The Investigation Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front recently issued its first investigation report on the atrocities of the American armed interventionists and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. The report begins by stating: "On July 14, 1950, after the Central Standing Committee of the Fatherland United Democratic Front organized this investigation committee headed by Xu Xian, based on thoroughly investigated facts, it has reached the irrefutable conclusion that the American armed interventionists, in order to forcibly turn our country into its colony and enslave our people, are violently violating international law and humanitarian principles, and adopting brutal methods of conducting war."

The report then goes on to list in detail the conclusive facts demonstrating the criminal atrocities of the American military: American aircraft and fleets indiscriminately bombed and strafed the homes and properties of peaceful residents in urban and rural areas that had no connection to military facilities, and wantonly destroyed cultural facilities such as schools, hospitals, theaters, recreation centers, and clubs, as well as peaceful factories and enterprises. The U.S. Air Force used bombs, rocket launchers, and machine guns to kill peaceful people, including women and children, and even wantonly strafed the masses who had fled to the mountains to avoid bombing, women washing clothes on the banks of the river, and farmers working in the fields.

The report concludes by stating: "The Korean people will never forget the unprecedented disaster brought to them by the American aggressors, and will strengthen their hatred towards them. We are confident that the Korean people's resentment towards the atrocities of the American interventionists will gain the sympathy of all good people around the world. The American interventionists and their accomplices will never be able to escape the responsibility for the bloodshed and atrocities they have committed."

    【新华社平壤五日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线调查委员会最近发表美国武装干涉者与李承晚匪帮暴行的第一号调查报告书。报告首称：一九五○年七月十四日，祖国统一民主主义战线中央常务委员会组织了以许宪为首的本调查委员会后，根据充分调查的事实，得出无可置辩的结论，即：美国武装干涉者为了以武力把我国变为它的殖民地，奴役我国人民，竟凶暴地违反国际法规和人道主义的原则，采取着凶残的进行战争的方法。
    报告继即详细列举了确凿的事实说明美军的罪恶暴行：美国飞机和舰队，对与军事设施毫无关系的城乡和平居民的房屋财产，滥肆轰炸扫射，恣意破坏学校、医院、剧场、休憩所、俱乐部等文化设施及和平工厂、企业。美国空军以炸弹、火箭炮与机枪杀害包括妇女和儿童的和平人民，甚至对于为躲避轰炸而跑到山上的群众，在江畔洗衣服的妇女和在田地里种地的农民，也恣意加以扫射。
    报告最后称：朝鲜人民永远不会忘记美国侵略者给朝鲜人民带来的未曾有过的灾难，并将加强对它的憎恨。我们确信：朝鲜人民对美国干涉者暴行的愤恨，将获得全世界一切善良人士的同情。美国干涉者及其帮凶们决不能摆脱因他们进行流血暴行而招致的责任。
