　　The Gathering of World Youth Peace Fighters
    ——A Record of the Capital Youth's Welcome to the World Federation of Democratic Youth Delegation
    By our reporter Tan Wenrui
    More than forty young peace fighters from different corners of the world officially met with the youth of Beijing on the morning of the 24th. Fifty thousand youth representatives expressed their heartfelt and warm welcome to their comrades-in-arms. At a time when American imperialism is frantically carrying out its war of aggression against Korea and provoking our people, the great meeting of Chinese youth and world democratic youth demonstrates the great strength of the people of all countries in defending peace and opposing war.
    The banner of the World Federation of Democratic Youth calling for "Youth Unite, March Towards Lasting Peace" was raised on the silvery flagpole, and beautiful peace doves soared over the sea of red flags. Everywhere resounded the song "Children of all nations, we all love peace." How solemn and magnificent! This is another peace oath of tens of thousands, no, tens of millions of young peace supporters: "Defend world peace, oppose imperialist wars of aggression, and strive for a bright future for the whole world!" This is everyone's common language.
    Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, announced at the meeting the will and confidence of Chinese youth in defending world peace, pointing out that "We will always remember the words our beloved leader Chairman Mao told us, and we deeply understand that in the cause of defending world peace and striving for independence and democracy, only by firmly standing in the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthening unity, and expanding unity with the democratic youth and peace-loving people of the world, can we guarantee our victory."
    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, stated that the Chinese people and youth are determined to thoroughly support the Soviet Union's peace policy and thoroughly support the peace proposals made by Vyshinsky a few days ago at Success Lake. Facing the proud sun, he excitedly recited the majestic verses: "Even though those with eye diseases close their eyes and dare not look directly at the sun, the sun is still radiant and shines in all directions. The sun will never reduce its light or heat for the sake of those with eye diseases!" The ghosts and monsters that depend on war for survival tremble in the sunshine of peace, and they will perish in the sunshine of peace!
    Bugala, representing the 70 million young peace fighters of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and also representing the Italian democratic youth who are risking poverty, imprisonment, and even death to fight against imperialism and its running dogs, paid tribute to the youth of China. We cannot help but think with brotherly concern of the young dockworkers in Naples who refused to unload American-made military supplies, and the young students in Genoa who shouted "American rulers get out of Italy!" Their struggle is not lonely; the democratic youth of the world are fighting alongside them. Bugala was right, "In the struggle to defend peace, the youth of the world should unite more closely. Only in this way can we become an invincible fortress and crush all the conspiracies of imperialism."
    On behalf of the delegation, Bugala presented a flag embroidered with the emblem of the World Federation of Democratic Youth to the youth of China, congratulating them on their victories and achievements, and wishing this flag to become a symbol of the unity and friendship between the democratic youth of the world and the youth of China. Liao Chengzhi and Feng Wenbin, two youth leaders, expressed the gratitude of the Chinese youth with warm embraces, telling him that the Chinese youth will more firmly unite around the World Federation of Democratic Youth and make greater efforts for the cause of world peace.
    Soviet representative Semi-Chastny, specially representing the Soviet youth and the Soviet youth vanguard—the Lenin Communist Youth League, presented the Chinese New Democratic Youth League with a flag embroidered with the images of the two great Soviet leaders—Lenin and Stalin. The Chinese youth league members and youth must actively respond to Comrade Feng Wenbin's call, under the banner of Lenin-Stalin and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, strengthen unity with the Soviet youth, and strive for the cause of world peace.
    Ebers, Executive Committee member of the International Union of Students, also presented the Chinese youth students with a flag embroidered with the emblem of the International Union of Students, symbolizing the greater unity of Chinese students and democratic students around the world in the struggle for lasting peace, people's democracy, and a bright future.
    Democratic youth all over the world are fighting for the same goal and against the same enemy. The youth of aggressor countries and the youth of countries being invaded have stood on the same front. Chon Chong Hwan, a combat hero from Korea, said: "The people and youth of all of Korea are fully confident of overcoming all difficulties, eliminating the American imperialist aggressors, and liberating all of Korea!" Markan, an American youth leader, excitedly reported: "The people and youth of the United States are increasingly loudly shouting 'American planes stop bombing the people of Northeast China, get out of Korea, get out of Taiwan, and recognize and support the new China in the United Nations Security Council.'" Vu Xuan Vinh, a heroic fighter from Vietnam, conveyed the determination of the Vietnamese people and youth to win the national liberation war to completely defeat French imperialism. Gibeer, a fighter in the French youth movement, pointed out that the French people and youth have made opposing the war of aggression against Vietnam their important task. He also presented a flag with the words "Stop the war in Vietnam, withdraw troops in Vietnam!" to the Vietnamese people and youth, expressing the determination of the French people and youth to support them. Two dear comrades-in-arms, one from Paris and one from the battlefield in Vietnam, embraced each other tightly, symbolizing the unity of the two great nations and also symbolizing the unity of progressive humanity around the world.
    The Chinese youth distributed a bright green flag with the words "We unite to defend world peace" to their comrades-in-arms, so that after they returned, they would always remember that millions of Chinese youth were with them in the struggle to defend world peace.
    The representatives of various countries also presented gifts to the Chinese youth to express their deep fighting friendship. The parachute presented by the Vietnamese representative, captured from the French aggressor army, represents the heroic fighting spirit and confidence in victory of the Vietnamese people and youth. The Burmese representative sent a fighting flag under which the people of Burma are persisting in the national liberation struggle. The Dutch and Indonesian representatives jointly sent a photo of the martyrs of the national liberation struggles of the two countries, symbolizing the determination of the youth of the two countries to unite in struggle. "The righteous, bright red blood has formed a solid friendship." This is the song of the democratic youth of the world uniting and advancing. The Chinese youth have witnessed with their own eyes the moving facts that demonstrate great internationalist friendship.
    Amidst thunderous applause, the conference passed a telegram opposing imperialist aggression against Korea and Taiwan, shouting angrily to the world the call to "Immediately withdraw American imperialist warships, planes, and troops from Korea and China's Taiwan." This is not only the will of tens of thousands of youth, but also the will of more than 70 million democratic youth around the world. They have made defending world peace their most important task at present. Due to the meeting of their representatives with Chinese youth, their fighting spirit and their confidence in victory will be even stronger. (Attached picture)

　　世界青年和平战士的会师
    ——记首都青年欢迎世界青联代表团大会
    本报记者  谭文瑞
    来自世界各不同角落的四十多位青年和平战士，二十四日早晨与北京的青年们正式见面。五万个青年的代表向他们的战友表示衷心与热烈的欢迎。在美帝国主义正疯狂地进行侵略朝鲜的战争和对我国人民挑衅的时候，中国青年与世界民主青年的大会师，这显示了各国人民保卫和平、反对战争巨大的力量。
    世界民主青年联盟号召“青年团结起来，向持久和平前进”的旗帜在银白色的旗杆上升起，美丽的和平鸽子在红旗的海洋上高飞翱翔，到处响起“世界各民族儿女，我们都热爱着和平”的歌声，是多么的庄严壮丽！这是几万个，不，几千万个青年和平拥护者的又一次和平宣誓：“保卫世界和平，反对帝国主义侵略战争，争取全世界美好的将来！”就是大家共同的语言。
    中华全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志在大会上宣告了中国青年保卫世界和平的意志与信心，指出“我们永远牢记住我们亲爱的领袖毛主席告诉我们的话，我们深深懂得在保卫世界和平、争取独立和民主的事业中，只有全世界民主青年和全世界爱好和平的人民，坚决站在以苏联为首的和平阵营里加强团结，扩大团结，才能保证我们的胜利。”
    中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若表示，中国的人民与青年决彻底拥护苏联的和平政策，并彻底拥护维辛斯基几天前在成功湖提出的和平建议。他面向着骄艳的太阳，激动地朗诵出雄壮的诗句：“尽管害了眼病的人闭着眼睛不敢正视太阳，太阳依然光芒万丈，照耀着四面八方。太阳决不会为了眼病患者减少它的一点光辉，减少它的一点热量！”依靠战争生存的鬼魅，在和平的阳光下发抖了，它们将在和平的阳光下灭亡！
    布加拉代表世界青联七千万青年和平战士，同时也代表正在冒着贫困、监禁、甚至死亡的危险，为反对帝国主义及其走狗而斗争的意大利民主青年向中国的青年致敬。使我们不禁以兄弟般的关怀想念着那波勒斯拒绝卸运美制军火的青年码头工人，热那亚高呼“美国统治者滚出意大利”的年青学生，他们的斗争不是孤单的，全世界的民主青年都和他们在一起进行战斗。布加拉说得对，“在保卫和平斗争中，全世界的青年应该团结得更紧密，只有这样我们才能成为不可战胜的堡垒，粉碎帝国主义的一切阴谋。”
    布加拉代表代表团把一面绣着世界民主青年联盟盟徽的旗子献给中国的青年，祝贺他们的胜利和成就，并且祝这面旗子成为全世界民主青年与中国青年团结和友谊的象征。廖承志、冯文彬两位青年领袖和布加拉以热烈的拥抱表示了中国青年的谢意，告诉他中国青年将更坚强的团结在世界民主青年联盟周围，为世界和平事业尽更大的努力。
    苏联代表赛米恰斯尼，特别代表苏联青年和苏联青年的先锋队——列宁共产主义青年团，送给中国新民主主义青年团一面绣着苏联两大领袖——列宁和斯大林像的旗子，中国的青年团员与青年们一定积极响应冯文彬同志的号召，在列宁——斯大林的旗帜下，在毛主席的领导下，加强与苏联青年的团结，为保卫世界和平事业而奋斗。
    国际学联执行委员艾贝尔斯也以一面绣有国际学联会徽的旗子送给中国的青年学生，象征中国学生与全世界民主学生在争取持久和平、人民民主与美好将来的斗争中更加团结。
    全世界的民主青年正在为同一的目标，向同一的敌人进行斗争，侵略国家与被侵略国家的青年已站在一条战线上了。朝鲜的战斗英雄全宗焕说：“全朝鲜的人民与青年完全有把握克服一切困难，消灭美国帝国主义侵略者，解放全朝鲜！”美国的青年领袖马克安兴奋地报告：“美国的人民和青年愈来愈响亮地喊着‘美国飞机停止滥炸中国东北人民，退出朝鲜，退出台湾，在联合国安全理事会上承认及支持新中国。’”越南的英勇战士武春荣传达了越南人民与青年争取彻底击败法国帝国主义的民族解放战争胜利的决心。法国青年运动的斗士基培尔指出法国人民和青年已把反对侵略越南战争作为他们的重要任务，他并把上面写着“停止越南战争、撤退在越南军队！”的旗子送给越南人民与青年，表示法国人民与青年支援他们的决心。来自巴黎和来自越南战场的两位亲爱的战友紧紧的拥抱在一起，象征着两大民族的团结，也象征着全世界进步人类的团结。
    中国青年以一面写着“我们团结在一起保卫世界和平”的鲜绿的旗子分送给他们的战友，让他们回去以后，在坚持保卫世界和平斗争当中，时刻想到千百万的中国青年是和他们在一起的。
    各国代表们也分别以礼物送给中国青年，表示他们深厚的战斗友情。越南代表所赠的从法国侵略军缴获的一个降落伞，表示越南人民与青年的英勇斗志与胜利的信心。缅甸代表送的是一面战斗的旗帜，缅甸的人民正在这旗帜下坚持民族解放斗争。荷兰与印尼代表共同送一幅两国民族解放斗争青年烈士遗像并列的照片，象征两国青年团结斗争的决心。“正义鲜红的热血，结成了巩固的友情。”这是全世界民主青年团结前进的歌声，中国的青年亲眼看见了表现伟大国际主义友爱的动人事实。
    大会在如雷的掌声中通过了反对帝国主义侵略朝鲜、台湾的通电，向全世界愤怒地喊出“美帝国主义的军舰、飞机、军队，立即退出朝鲜以及中国的台湾。”的呼声，这不仅是几万个青年的意志，而且是全世界七千多万民主青年的意志。他们已把保卫世界和平作为他们当前最重大的任务了，由于他们的代表与中国青年的会师，他们的斗志和他们胜利的信心将更坚强。（附图片）
