[Report from this newspaper] Beijing Tram Company, since launching the innovation record movement in July, workers have demonstrated great wisdom and enthusiasm for labor. The repair shop completed the annual production task four months ahead of schedule on August 31st: manufacturing 18 new trams and overhauling 12 engine and sleeper cars each (details published on page 2 of this newspaper on September 15th); in terms of tram route transportation and business: it achieved the slogan of "turning slow months into good months" and "turning rainy days into sunny days," creating a new record of safe travel of 10,000 kilometers.

For more than 20 years since the Beijing Tram Company was established, July and August have always been characterized by fewer passengers and poor business performance. During the innovation record movement, all tram route staff used their brains and first identified the reasons for the low passenger numbers: mainly the hot weather, making passengers feel stuffy and exposed to the sun in the trams, as well as the unpleasant smell; at the same time, it was the summer vacation period for schools, so there were particularly few passengers. Based on these reasons, everyone adopted various methods to attract passengers. First, they strengthened the driver operation rules, strictly adhered to the timetable to ensure travel intervals, gaining the trust of citizens. To this end, some crew teams installed stopwatches in their cars to check travel times at any time. Second, they improved the cleanliness and hygiene inside the cars. Crew 47 took the lead in paying attention to the environmental hygiene inside the car, with everyone voluntarily contributing money to buy window curtains to block the sun; they also bought brooms to clean at any time. Crew 24 went a step further by installing cool straw mats in their car. Under the leading influence of Crew 47 and Crew 24, many groups automatically learned from them. Due to the promotion by the masses, the administration bought many brooms, sprayers, and other cleaning supplies, as well as curtains, which were widely distributed to each crew, and a regular car washing system was established. This kept the inside of the cars clean and hygienic at all times. At the same time, most of the ticket sellers were amiable and answered all questions from passengers; to take care of passenger safety, some groups automatically organized safety mutual aid groups to help take care of passengers. Thanks to everyone's efforts, the call to "turn slow months into good months" was finally realized. According to the statistics for July, there were more than four million passengers, setting a new record since the establishment of the tram company.

"Turning rainy days into sunny days" was also a major improvement and achievement. In the past, trams could not run at all when it rained. Since Comrade Lu Yuntai from the repair shop invented the splash guard in late April of this year, there has been no problem with running the trams in the rain; however, when the trams run on rainy days, many passengers' umbrellas carry a lot of rainwater, which easily flows from the floor seams into the resistors, which can easily cause obstacles. During the innovation record movement, the drivers and conductors on the trams paid attention to this problem. For example, Jin Zhibin, the driver of Crew 63, opened the floor when the power went out due to rain and used a tool to absorb water from the resistors to prevent obstacles. And everyone working on the tram constantly advised passengers to put their umbrellas on both sides of the car to prevent water from flowing into the resistors and affecting the operation. Drivers were also particularly careful when driving in the rain, most of them using coasting and not using the brakes. When encountering too deep water, they automatically stopped the car and contacted the person in charge at the station. In this way, everyone overcame the difficulties of running the trams in the rainy season and realized "turning rainy days into sunny days."

From July 1st to August 31st, twenty-four production teams in the tram company achieved the new record slogan of safe travel of 10,000 kilometers. Crew 101 created the highest record of more than 12,300 safe kilometers, and they did not have any accidents in the two months.

### 京电车公司创二十余年来新纪录  变“背月为好月”扩大营业  二十四个生产组实现了安全行走一万公里的口号

　　京电车公司创二十余年来新纪录
    变“背月为好月”扩大营业
    二十四个生产组实现了安全行走一万公里的口号
    【本报讯】通讯员宁源涛报道：北京电车公司，由七月份开展创新纪录运动以来，工人们发挥了高度的智慧和劳动热情，修造厂提前四个月于八月三十一日完成了全年生产任务——造新车十八辆，大修机枕车各十二辆（详情已刊九月十五日本报二版）；车路运输营业方面：实现了“背月变好月”，“雨天变晴天”的口号，创造了安全走行一万公里的新纪录。
    电车公司开办二十多年以来，每到七、八月份，总是乘客少，营业情况不好。在创新纪录运动中，全体车路工作人员开动脑筋，首先找出乘客少的原因：主要是天气炎热，乘客坐在电车里又闷又晒，且气味难闻；同时又是各学校放暑假的期间，所以乘客特别少。大家根据这些原因，采取了各种不同的方式争取乘客。首先是加强了司机运转规则，严格按时刻表行车，以保证行车间隔，取得市民信任，为此有的乘务小组在自己车上按装了马蹄表，随时对照行车时间。其次，改善车内清洁卫生。乘务四十七组首先注意了车内的环境卫生，由大家自动出钱买了窗户帘，挡住太阳；又买了扫帚，随时打扫。二十四组更进一步的在自己的车上按装了凉席垫。在四十七组和二十四组的带头影响下，很多的组都自动的学习起来。由于群众的推动，行政上买了很多扫帚、喷壶等清洁用具及窗帘，普遍分发各乘务组，并建立了定期倒车制度，这就使车内保持了经常的清洁和卫生。同时在售票员方面，大部分作到态度和蔼，对待乘客有问必答；为了照顾乘客安全，有的小组自动的组织了安全互助小组，帮助照料乘客。由于大家这样的努力，终于实现了“背月变好月”的号召。据七月份一个月的统计，共有四百多万乘客，创电车公司开办以来的新纪录。
    “雨天变晴天”也是一个重大的改进和收获。在过去，一下雨根本就不能行车。自从今年四月底修造厂卢运泰同志发明了挡水板，下雨时出车是没问题了；但雨天行车时，有很多乘客拿的雨伞上带有很多雨水，很容易从地板缝流到阻力里边，极易发生障碍。在创新纪录运动中，车上的司机员和售票员，都重视了这个问题，如六十三组司机员金质彬，在下雨停电的时候，把地板打开，用吃水的东西伸入到阻力里边吸水，以免发生障碍。并且每个在车上工作的人，随时劝导乘客把雨伞放在车房两边，以免把水流到阻力里边影响行车。司机员在下雨行车的时候也特别小心，大部分作到了多走余力，不用电闸，遇到水太深的地方，就自动的把车停起来，再与站上负责人连络。大家就这样克服了雨季行车的困难，实现了“雨天变晴天”。
    从七月一日到八月三十一日的两个月，电车公司有二十四个生产组实现了安全走行一万公里新纪录的口号，一○一组则创造了一万二千三百余安全公里的最高纪录，他们在两个月当中没有发生过任何事故。
