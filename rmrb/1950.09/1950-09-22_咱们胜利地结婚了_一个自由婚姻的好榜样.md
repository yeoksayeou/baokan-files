　　"We have victoriously married..."
　　——A good example of a free marriage
　　To the Editor:
　　The People's Garden on June 2nd published the incident of Hou Heitan, director of the Wu Committee of Dusi Village in Xinle County, Hebei, and Hou Xiaodan obstructing the free marriage of Hou Yanguo, chairman of the Women's Federation, and Liu Lianhe, deputy secretary of the Youth League, and being sentenced to six months in prison by the county people's court. Now Hou Yanguo and Liu Lianhe have married, their married life is happy, and their production is active. I will now tell you about the process.
　　After Hou Heitan and Hou Xiaodan were sentenced to six months in prison by the county people's court, Hou Yanguo and Liu Lianhe immediately requested to get married. However, Yanguo's father disagreed, saying that if the government approved Yanguo's marriage to Lianhe, he would commit suicide. The county committee sent someone to explain to him in person, explaining that the best way for an old man to love his daughter is to let her marry freely; and used the tragedies caused by arranged marriages in the old society and the happy lives of free marriages in the new society to enlighten him. However, Yanguo's father still made a scene, resolutely disagreeing with his daughter marrying Lianhe, believing that the government sentenced Heitan and Xiaodan, who helped him prevent this marriage, to imprisonment, and then marrying his daughter to Liu Lianhe himself, which was a "disgrace." However, Yanguo still insisted, "As long as the government makes the decision, I will marry Lianhe even if I die!" The district government immediately approved their marriage. The county people's court was initially still concerned that Yanguo's father would have an accident, and proposed postponing the marriage and ordering the district government to withdraw the marriage certificate. The county committee and the Youth League believed that this was a unprincipled concession to backward thinking and immediately criticized it. The court finally believed that these opinions were correct and reissued the marriage certificate to them.
　　When Yanguo and Lianhe discussed the date of their marriage, Lianhe's mother said, "This is a major event in life! We have to sell some grain, buy clothes, and buy furniture before getting married." Yanguo dissuaded, "What's the point of buying these things? It's better to use the money to buy more manure for the land; we'll produce more grain in the future to buy livestock, and life will be better."
　　After Yanguo and Lianhe got married, life was very happy. She worked even harder in production. She wove four bolts of cloth (each bolt equals 16 chi in the market) in ten days, and made two sets of clothes and a pair of shoes. They often talked about how to improve the work of the Youth League and the Women's Federation in the village. They said, "We have victoriously married, but don't forget that there are still many young men and women who are suffering from feudal oppression. We must vigorously promote the Marriage Law in the future." Young men and women in the village are willing to talk to them about their innermost thoughts and regard them as their role models. Lianhe's mother is so happy that she can't close her mouth, and tells everyone, "My daughter-in-law knows how to live a good life." The neighbors also praise them as a loving couple!

　　“咱们胜利地结婚了………”
    ——一个自由婚姻的好榜样编辑同志：
    六月二日人民园地发表了河北新乐县杜寺村武委会主任侯黑炭和侯小旦阻挠妇女会主席侯彦国和青年团副书记刘连合自由结婚，被县人民法院判处半年徒刑的事件。现侯彦国、刘连合已经结婚，婚后生活美满，生产积极。我现在把经过情形告诉你们。
    侯黑炭、侯小旦被县人民法院判处半年徒刑后，侯彦国、刘连合即要求结婚。但彦国的父亲不同意，说如果政府批准彦国与连合结婚，他就要自杀。县委会便派人当面向他解释，说明老人疼爱女儿的最好方法是让她自由结婚；并用旧社会家庭包办婚姻所造成的悲剧与新社会自由结婚生活美满的事实作对比，以启发他。但彦国父亲仍是闹死闹活，坚决不同意他的女儿和连合结婚，认为政府把帮助他阻止这件婚事的黑炭、小旦两人判了徒刑后，自己再把闺女嫁给刘连合，这是“丢人”的事情。但彦国仍坚持说：“只要政府给作主，死也要和连合结婚！”区政府即批准他俩结婚。县人民法院最初尚顾虑彦国父亲会发生意外，提出缓期结婚，并令区政府抽回结婚证。县委会、青年团认为这是无原则的迁就落后思想，当即提出批评。法院最后认为这些意见是对的，重将结婚证发给他们。
    彦国和连合商量结婚的日期时，连合的娘说：“这是一辈子的大事！我们得粜些粮食，买了衣裳、置了家具后，再过门。”彦国劝阻说：“买这些东西干啥？不如拿钱多买点粪上地；往后多打粮买个牲口，光景就会过得更好。”
    彦国和连合结婚后，生活挺美满。她生产也更加劲了，过门十天就织了四勾子布（每勾合市尺一丈六尺），作了两身衣裳、一双鞋。他俩常叨念着怎样把村里青年团和妇女会工作搞好。他们说：“咱们胜利地结婚了，可别忘了还有好些青年男女还受着封建压迫呢。咱们往后要好好宣传婚姻法。”村里青年男女谁有心腹话也愿找他俩说说，把他俩看成是自己的榜样。连合的娘乐得合不上嘴，逢人就说：“俺媳妇会过日子。”街坊邻居们也夸奖他们是情投意合的好俩口！
