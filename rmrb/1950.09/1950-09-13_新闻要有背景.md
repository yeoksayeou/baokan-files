News Must Have Background
    Chen Kehan
    Any news is produced under certain environmental and historical conditions. Therefore, news reports often need to introduce its background in order to correctly reflect things.
    Introducing the background of the news, that is, introducing the history and environment in which things are produced, aims to help various readers to more easily and correctly understand the content of the news, grasp the central idea of the news, accept the experience of revolutionary struggle and construction work disseminated by the news, and develop a good interest in the news.
    The background of news is often an indispensable factor of the news itself. Because China has a vast territory, inconvenient transportation, and a low level of people's culture, people know very little about things in other provinces and regions. Moreover, the development of revolutionary struggles and construction work in various places is very uneven. Under the guidance of the unified policies and policies of the Central People's Government, various places are carrying out work in accordance with local conditions. Therefore, when reporting news, it is particularly necessary to pay attention to introducing its environment and historical conditions. Taking rural work as an example, the old liberated areas in Northeast and North China are mostly sparsely populated and have undergone land reform, truly realizing that tillers have their land. The main tasks at present are: organizing farmers' mutual aid in labor, improving production efficiency, and developing the agricultural economy. However, the situation in some newly liberated areas in the south of the Yangtze River is different. They are generally characterized by less land and more people, and land reform has not yet been implemented. If labor mutual aid is prematurely promoted unrealistically, it may hinder production. Their immediate task is not to organize labor mutual aid, but to mobilize peasants, eliminate bandits, overthrow local bullies, stabilize rural social order, implement reasonable burdens, reduce rent, and then distribute land so that labor and land are combined to increase production. In this way, whether a journalist reports on the production mutual aid movement of peasants in the old areas or the anti-bully rent reduction movement of peasants in the new areas, he must separately explain the background of this or that movement, such as geographical and economic conditions and work development conditions, so that readers in various places can easily understand and avoid certain cadres mistakenly applying work experience from different regions. It can be seen that introducing the background of news should not be regarded merely as a technical issue, but should become a basic rule of news reporting.
    We often talk about the mass viewpoint and dialectical materialism, but how is this viewpoint truly combined with actual business and manifested in our frequent news reports? For a journalist, the mass viewpoint first lies in discovering problems related to the interests of the majority of the people, writing them in simple, clear, and vivid words, and striving for as many readers as possible to understand. Making as many readers as possible understand and accept is the first important thing that journalists should always care about. Journalists write news not to hide it in famous mountains, nor to chant it with a few close friends while sipping tea, but to make readers aware of the changing things in the world and accept the knowledge and experience of revolutionary struggle and scientific construction disseminated by the news. To achieve this, many aspects of efforts are required, and one important method is to make necessary explanations of the background of the news frequently. Because: the scope of readers is very wide, they are scattered in various places, and each person's knowledge and experience are different. People in area B may not know the geography, history, socio-economic conditions, and customs of area A; farmers know very little or nothing about things in factories. Since you want them to read your news and be interested in it, you have to think of some way to make them understand it. Readers are the basic masses of journalists, and are generally the objects that journalists want to attract and unite. If even their most basic requirements cannot be satisfied, how can they be resonated with? As for dialectical materialism, according to Marx's theory, in observing any thing, its inherent connection should be revealed, and its time and space conditions and growth and development process should be analyzed. Only in this way can problems be correctly explained and solved. Shouldn't our news reports adopt this scientific attitude?
    In our news reports, there is often this situation, that is, reporting a certain surface phenomenon in isolation, without explaining the environment and historical conditions in which this phenomenon is produced. Such news itself is very incomplete. It is not easy for readers to understand it, and it is even more difficult to learn a lot from it. China, as a result of the long-term rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, is a country with relatively backward culture and technology, but after liberation, many amazing things have appeared. If these amazing deeds are not linked to their historical background and specific conditions, some may seem insignificant, and some may become unimaginable, and sometimes the same news may even cause two contradictory feelings. For example, a certain news report once said that a certain factory increased production by 50% in the past year, of which the increase of category A goods was a certain amount, the increase of category B was a certain amount, and the increase of category C was a certain amount... The total was 50%, but there was not a single word about how the increase was achieved. As a result, some people will say after reading the news, what's so rare about this, haven't other countries increased production more than us? Some people hold the opposite view: this is impossible unless the production equipment is fundamentally changed. Can you say which of these two opinions is correct and which is wrong? In my opinion, both opinions can be said to be correct. The mistake is made by the journalist who wrote this news, because he did not explain at all on what basis, under what conditions, and by what methods the achievement of a 50% increase was obtained. Therefore, the same number can be said to be too small, and it can also be said to be too large. Numbers are meaningless if they are not linked to other factors. That is to say, reporting work achievements in isolation, without explaining the objective conditions and subjective reasons for the production of these achievements, will make it impossible for readers to understand, and even doubt the news itself. In our people's democratic New China, workers, peasants, and other working people have created many moving miracles with their labor and wisdom, but our journalists have not reported even one-tenth of it; and the existing reports often only have bones and lack flesh and blood, failing to arouse enough attention and interest from readers. One of the reasons is that they have not fully reflected the objective and difficult conditions faced by the working people and the great efforts made to overcome these difficulties. This is where our propaganda reporters are ashamed of the actual creators.
    However, the harm of reporting a certain work achievement in isolation is generally only limited to not being able to truly and fully reflect the overall situation of the matter, making it impossible for readers to understand, thereby weakening the propaganda effect. What is more serious is to spread certain work experience and work methods in isolation, without explaining the location, time, and objective historical conditions and subjective work process in which this experience was produced. This not only makes it impossible for people engaged in similar businesses to learn from it, but sometimes even leads to some undesirable malpractices when it is mistakenly mechanically applied. Here, we may as well give another example, which is some reports on tax collection work this spring. Some reporters said: According to the work experience of a certain place, only democratic evaluation and tax calculation according to rates is the only correct method; some reporters said: It is more scientific to adopt the method of self-declaration and payment in kind, combined with account checking; some reporters said: I have proved through on-the-spot interviews that these two methods may not necessarily work. A method of fixed-term fixed-amount assessment should be adopted. There are really many opinions and no consensus; but everyone has a common problem, that is, they have not fully explained the objective situation and conditions for the success of adopting a certain method. After further in-depth investigation and research, it was proved that the above three methods are correct under certain conditions. It is produced in different environments and can be applied to different situations separately. If industrial and commercial enterprises have a sound accounting system that can be used as evidence for collection, the method of self-declaration and payment in kind combined with account checking can be adopted; if they do not meet this standard, the method of democratic evaluation and tax calculation according to rates can be adopted; for small industrial and commercial businesses and small towns, it is difficult to use the two methods of account checking and democratic evaluation, and the method of fixed-term fixed-amount tax collection can be adopted. But if a certain work experience and work method is absolutized, and the specific situation and conditions in which this experience and method are generated are completely removed, and an attempt is made to describe it as the only and unique experience and method that can be applied in all occasions, and other experiences and methods generated in other situations and conditions are rejected (for example, saying that only democratic evaluation and tax calculation according to rates is the only correct method), then it is incorrect. Through the experience of propaganda on land reform from 1946 to 1948, the situation of blindly spreading wrong work experience and work methods has been greatly reduced. This is a major progress in our press and proves that our ideological and political level has been improved to some extent. However, the kind of news that isolates and unilaterally publicizes a certain work experience and work method, without explaining the specific environment and conditions in which this experience and method are produced, has not only not been eliminated, but is still very large. Can it be said that this is a pragmatic scientific attitude? Doesn't this prove that our level of materialism is still very insufficient? It is necessary to know that blindly spreading wrong experience is of course extremely wrong and has caused some losses to our actual work; but unilaterally spreading the kind of experience that can only be applied under certain conditions, without explaining its limits, so that readers only see the trees and not the forest, may cause great harm if it is mistakenly mechanically applied. Therefore, in reporting various things, especially in introducing work experience and methods, the background should be explained in moderation according to the degree of necessity.
    So, is it necessary to have a set of background descriptions for all news? Not necessarily. The production of everything has its own background, but the background of some things is self-evident, so it can be omitted; and the background of some things needs to be explained repeatedly at first, but later it is well known, so there is no need to repeat it every day. For example, now people in various places have launched a vigorous movement against the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea. This movement was caused by the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea. This is already a well-known fact, so there is no need to add words such as "due to the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea" to every news report about this movement. However, it is okay to publish some articles and materials introducing the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea in newspapers from time to time to increase readers' understanding of this matter. But there are also some things whose background has been reported in the past, but the time interval is too long and has been forgotten by everyone, so it needs to be re-explained when reporting this news again. These all depend on the specific circumstances at the time. Not every piece of news must have a long paragraph of background narration, but the explanation of the background is very necessary for the news in most occasions. The responsibility of journalists lies in introducing and disseminating the situation and experience of revolutionary struggles and construction work in various places. To do this work well, it is necessary to pay attention to reflecting the overall situation when reporting news, and to take care of the conditions of readers, so that they can get a correct understanding.
    Introducing the background of a piece of news does not require too much unnecessary narration, description, or discussion, but should use the most general and concise words to try to make the matter clear. Sometimes, just one or two sentences or even a few words, like the finishing touch, can break the matter. Still take the example of a certain factory increasing production. Suppose that the increase in production of the factory is the result of workers improving operating methods, and the purpose of that news is to report the achievements of production, then it may as well be written like this: "A certain factory increased production by 50% in the past year, which was obtained by workers by improving operating methods without any change in the original technical equipment and number of workers." Then, you can describe the specific situation of the increase in production. If the purpose of the news report is to introduce the situation and experience of workers improving operating methods, then it can be reported like this: "The workers of a certain factory improved operating methods, fully utilized the original technical equipment, and increased the production of the factory by 50%, and the labor force has not been increased." After that, you can introduce the situation and experience of improving operating methods. Here, the description of the status of technical equipment and labor force is actually the introduction of the background of the news, and the number of words used is not very large. Using too many words to narrate the background in a rambling way will not only make the text bloated, but also blur the theme of the news. This is a phenomenon that should be avoided.

　　新闻要有背景
    陈克寒
    任何新闻都是在一定的环境和历史条件之下产生的，因此，新闻报道要正确地反映事物，就常常需要介绍它的背景。
    介绍新闻的背景，即介绍事物产生的历史和环境，目的在于帮助各种不同的读者更容易正确地了解新闻的内容，掌握新闻的中心思想，接受新闻所传播的革命斗争和建设工作的经验，并对新闻发生良好的兴趣。
    新闻的背景往往是新闻本身不可或缺的因素。中国由于地域辽阔，交通不便，人民文化水平较低，知道他省他地的事情很少，而且各地革命斗争和建设工作的发展很不平衡，在中央人民政府的统一的方针政策指导下，各地都因地制宜地进行工作，因此，在报道新闻时，就格外需要注意介绍它的环境和历史条件。以农村工作为例，东北、华北老解放区，大多地广人稀，并已经过土地改革，真正做到了耕者有其田，目前的主要任务是：组织农民劳动互助，提高生产效率，发展农业经济。但江南某些新解放区的情形就不一样，那里一般地是地少人多，还没有实行土地改革，如果不切实际地过早提倡劳动互助，反而可能妨害生产。他们的当务之急，不是组织劳动互助，而是发动农民，清除土匪，打倒恶霸，安定农村社会秩序，实行合理负担，减租，进而分配土地，使劳力和土地结合，以增加生产。这样，新闻记者不论是报道老区农民的生产互助运动或新区农民的反恶霸减租运动，都必须分别地说明这种或那种运动的背景，如地理经济情况和工作发展条件等，以使各地读者容易了解，并避免某些干部错误地搬用不同地区的工作经验。可见，介绍新闻背景这件事，不能仅仅看作是一个技术问题，而应成为新闻报道的基本规则。
    我们常谈群众观点和辩证法唯物论，但这种观点怎样真正与实际业务结合，在我们经常进行的新闻报道中表现出来呢？群众观点，对于一个新闻记者说来，首先在于发现与大多数人民利益有关的问题，用简单、明了、生动的文字写出，争取尽可能多的读者了解。使尽可能多的读者了解和接受，这是新闻记者时刻应该关心的第一件要紧事情。记者写作新闻，不是为了藏诸名山，也不是为了跟几个知心朋友品茗时吟咏，而是为了使读者知道世界上变动中的事物，接受新闻所传播的革命斗争和科学建设的知识和经验。要做到这一点，须要作许多方面的努力，其中一个重要办法，就是对于新闻的背景经常作必要的说明。因为：读者范围很广，他们散居各地，各人的知识和阅历不同，甲地的地理历史、社会经济、风俗习惯，乙地的人不一定知道；工厂里的事情，农民懂得很少或完全不懂。你既然要他们读你的新闻，并对之发生兴趣，就总得想一些办法使他们读得懂。读者，是新闻记者的基本群众，一般地都是记者所要吸引和团结的对象，如果对于他们这种最起码的要求都不能加以满足，还如何能够引起他们的共鸣呢？至于说到辩证法唯物论，根据马克思的这一学说，无论观察任何事物，都应该揭露它内在的联系，分析它的时间空间条件以及生长发展过程。只有这样，才能正确地说明问题和解决问题。我们的新闻报道不是正应该采取这种科学态度吗？
    在我们的新闻报道中，常常有这种情形，就是孤立地报道某一表面现象，而不说明这种现象产生的环境和历史条件。这样的新闻本身是非常不完整的，读者要去理解它已经不容易，更难从这中间学到很多东西。中国，由于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义长期统治的结果，是一个文化技术比较落后的国家，但在解放以后，却出现了许多惊人事迹。这些惊人事迹，如果不与产生它的历史背景和具体条件联系起来看，有的会似乎颇不足道，有的又成为不可想像，有时甚至同一件新闻会令人发生两种互相矛盾的观感。例如，曾有某一新闻报道说，某某工厂在过去一年中增产百分之五十，其中甲类货品增加若干，乙类增加若干，丙类又增加若干…………合计是百分之五十，但却没有一个字提到是怎样增产的。于是，有的人在读了新闻后会说，这有什么希罕，别的国家不是比我们增产得还要多些么？有的人则又持相反的见解：这是不可能的事，除非生产设备根本改变。你能说这两种意见那一种是正确的，那一种是错误的呢？照我看来，两种意见可说都是正确的，犯错误的是我们写这件新闻的记者，因为他根本没有说明这个增产百分之五十的成绩，是在什么基础之上，具备着什么条件，采取了什么方法得来的。因之，这同一个数目字，可以说是太小了，又可以说是太大了。数目字如果不与其他因素联系起来，原本是毫无意义的啊。这就是说，孤立地报道工作成绩，而不说明产生这种成绩的客观条件和主观原因，会使读者无法了解，乃至对新闻本身发生怀疑。在我们人民民主的新中国，工人、农民和其他劳动人民用他们的劳动和智慧创造了许许多多可歌可泣的奇迹，但我们的新闻记者却没有报道出它的什一；而已有的报道也往往只有骨头，缺乏血肉，引不起读者足够的重视和兴趣，原因之一就在于没有充分地反映劳动人民所面临的客观的困难条件以及征服这些困难所发挥的巨大努力。这是我们宣传报道工作者有愧于实际创造活动者的地方。
    但孤立地报道某一工作成绩，它的害处一般地还仅限于不能真正充分地反映出事情的全面情况，使读者无法了解，从而减弱了宣传效果。更严重的是孤立地传播某种工作经验和工作方法，而不说明产生这种经验的地点、时间以及客观的历史条件和主观的工作过程，这样不仅使执行同类业务的人不能有所取法，有时甚至被错误地机械搬用，发生一些不应有的流弊。这里不妨再举一个例子，就是今年春天某些关于税收工作的报道。有的记者说：根据某地的工作经验，只有民主评议，依率计征，是唯一正确的办法；有的记者说：采取自报实缴、配合查账的方法，还更科学一些；有的记者则说：我经实地采访证明，这两种办法都不一定行得通，应该采取定期定额的计征法。真是众论纷纭，莫衷一是；但大家却都有一个共同的毛病，就是没有充分地说明采用某种方法获得成功的客观情况和条件。以后经过更深入的调查研究，证明：上述三种办法在一定条件下都是正确的，它由不同环境中产生，可以分别地适用于不同情况。工商企业有健全的会计制度，可资为征收确据者，可以采用自报实缴，配合查账的办法；不合这个标准的，可以采用民主评议，依率计征的办法；小工商业及小城镇，用查账和民主评议两项办法都有困难的，可以采用定期定额的征税办法。但如果把某一种工作经验和工作方法绝对化，根本抽去产生这一经验和方法的具体情况和条件，企图把它说成在一切场合都可适用的唯一无二的经验和方法，而排斥在其他情况和条件下产生的其他经验和方法（例如说只有民主评议，依率计征是唯一正确的办法），那就是不正确的了。经过一九四六——四八年关于土地改革宣传的经验，那种盲目地传播错误的工作经验和工作方法的情形是大大地减少了，这是我们新闻界的一大进步，证明我们的思想水平和政治水平已有某种程度的提高。可是那种孤立地片面地宣传某一工作经验和工作方法，而不说明这种经验和方法产生的具体环境和条件的新闻，却不但没有消灭，而且还是很不少的。难道可以说这是实事求是的科学态度吗？这不正证明我们唯物论的水平还很不够吗？要知道盲目地传播错误的经验，固然是极端错误的，曾使我们的实际工作受到某些损失；但孤立地片面地传播那种只在一定条件才能适用的经验，而不说明它的界限，使读者只见树木，不见森林，万一被错误地机械搬用，为害同样会是很大的。所以，报道各种事物，尤其是介绍工作经验和方法，都应该视其必要程度，酌量地说明它们的背景。
    那末，是不是所有新闻都非有一套背景的描写不可呢？那倒也不见得。每件事情的产生都有它一定的背景，但有些事情的背景是不言自明的，就可略而不述；也有些事情的背景，起初需要一再说明，以后已为众所周知，就不必天天去重复地叙述它。譬如，现在各地人民都展开了轰轰烈烈的反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜运动，这个运动是因为美国侵略台湾、朝鲜而引起的，这已是家喻户晓的事实，就可不必再在每则报道这一运动的新闻中，加上“由于美国侵略台湾、朝鲜”等等字样。但却不妨在报纸上陆续发表一些介绍美国侵略台湾和朝鲜情形的文章和资料，来增加读者对这件事情的认识。可是也有一些事情，它的背景当初曾经报道过，但时间隔得太久，已为大家所遗忘，在再报道这件新闻的时候就需要重新加以阐明。这些都要看当时的具体情况而定。不是每则新闻都一定要有一长段背景的叙述，但背景的说明在多数场合对于新闻是很必要的。新闻记者的责任，在于介绍和传播各地革命斗争和建设工作的情况和经验。要把这个工作做好，就需要在报道新闻时注意反映全面情况，并照顾读者的条件，使他们得到正确的理解。
    介绍一件新闻的背景，并不要太多的不必要的叙述、描写或议论，而应该用最概括最简洁的字句，求得把事情交代清楚。有的时候，只要一二句话甚或几个字，像画龙点睛那样，把事情点破一下，就可以了。仍然以某工厂增产为例。假定该工厂的增产，是由于工人改良操作方法的结果，而那件新闻的目的在于报道生产的成绩，那末，就不妨这样地写：“某工厂过去一年增产百分之五十，这是在原有技术设备和工人人数毫无改变的情形下，由工人以改良操作的方法获得的。”接着，就可叙述增产的具体情况。如果新闻报道的目的是要介绍工人改良操作方法的情形和经验，那末，就可以这样地报道：“某工厂工人改良了操作方法，充分地利用原有的技术设备，使该厂增产达百分之五十，而劳动力并未有所增加。”以后就可介绍改良操作方法的情形和经验。这里技术设备和劳动力状况的说明，实际上就都是新闻的背景的介绍，而所用的字数并不很多。用太多的话去噜噜嗦嗦地叙述背景，不但使文字臃肿不堪，而且会模糊新闻的主题，这是应该避免的现象。
