Southern Jiangsu Universally Trains District and Township Cadres
Summarize Work, Rectify Work Style, Study Land Reform Policies
Focus on Overcoming Commandism and Selfish, Self-Serving Ideologies

[This newspaper reports] According to the *Sunan Daily* news: Since mid-June, district and township cadres in various areas of Southern Jiangsu have successively begun rectification and land reform studies. Except for individual areas that have adopted meeting methods for rectification, most have adopted centralized rotational training. Songjiang Prefecture has held three training sessions, training a total of 588 cadres; Suzhou held one session, 412 people; Changzhou held one session, 435 people; Zhenjiang held one session, 380 people; Wuxian and Wuxi County Committees each held one session, approximately 500 people. After August, rotational training classes held by various district and county committees have generally begun. Before October, approximately 23,000 district and township cadres in the entire Southern Jiangsu region will have completed rectification and training.

Before August, the rectification movement was still in its initial stage. Although the rectification and training of district and township cadres in various areas had achieved some results, the rectification methods and requirements were not very clear, and the degree of importance attached by the leadership varied, so the arrangements and effects were also different. For example, the three training sessions held in Songjiang Prefecture mainly focused on land reform studies and summarizing and arranging work, but no special rectification studies were conducted. Therefore, not much effect was achieved in rectifying the ideological work style of cadres. The first training session of the Wuxi County Committee dedicated two-thirds of the time to rectification studies and one-third of the time to land reform studies. They repeatedly mobilized for rectification studies, but because they started by reading documents and did not organize this work well, especially since the leadership failed to give more systematic and specialized reports, although most cadres exposed and criticized erroneous ideologies and work styles such as commandism and corruption, their ideological and political level did not receive the improvement it should have.

Since August, district and township cadre training classes have generally begun. Because the main cadres of various district committees, county committees, and district committees participated in the first phase of rectification studies at the Southern Jiangsu Party School and initially gained experience in leading rectification, the rotational training plans and the initial situation of rotational training in various places show significant progress compared to before August. For example, the Changshu County Committee's rectification plan for township cadre training classes clearly stated that the focus of rectification is to overcome undesirable ideological work styles such as commandism and selfishness that are detached from the masses. The basic methods are "study reports, discuss typical examples, check work, summarize experiences, and carry out criticism and self-criticism." It also stipulated that, based on the eight land reform disciplines and the specific situation of the county, the county committee should make two reports: "How to Be a Good Cadre" and "How to Serve the People." After the reports, there will be two to two and a half days of discussion, and then further typical model reports of good and bad examples will be carried out to enlighten everyone to distinguish right from wrong, grasp principles, and learn to correctly use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism. On this basis, a general self-examination will be carried out, personal summaries will be made, and the determination to overcome shortcomings and improve work will be expressed. The rectification plan of the Liyang County Committee stipulates that checking work is the main method of rectification. In checking the major work of the past year, the comparison of success and failure, obedience to leadership and disobedience to leadership, and correct and incorrect work styles will be used to check and summarize work experience, and to connect with checking individual ideological work styles. The Zhenjiang Prefectural Committee convened a meeting on experimental work in typical land reform townships in various counties of the prefecture on July 22nd. At the meeting, the cadres participating conducted six days of rectification studies. The main method was to check work from top to bottom, carry out criticism and self-criticism, find the root causes of problems, and improve the political awareness of cadres. During the inspection phase, leading cadres of each county first conducted self-examination through checking work, and fully promoted democracy to organize everyone to discuss and make suggestions. After such enlightenment, most cadres discovered many of their own mistakes and carried out self-criticism and mutual criticism. And they were able to start by analyzing the situation and raising their understanding of the problem to the level of ideological principles.

Judging from the rectification situation of township-level cadres in various places, the following points of experience should be noted in the future rectification of township-level cadres:

(1) The rectification studies of township-level cadres should start from enlightening and improving class consciousness, establishing a revolutionary viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly. Using reports, repeatedly explaining positive principles, and organizing in-depth discussions is more effective. It is not necessary to force them to read documents. (2) The focus of rectification for township-level cadres is generally to overcome commandism and selfishness. Too many contents should not be listed in parallel, otherwise the main problems will not be solved. (3) Rectification of township-level cadres also requires a firm grasp of the method of checking work, but leading cadres must first conduct top-down checks, analyze the situation, find the main problems in the work, and connect it with checking leadership thinking and work style, so that everyone understands how to conduct checks and analysis. (4) Checking work should focus on analyzing shortcomings and mistakes, but it is also necessary to point out achievements and advantages in order to increase confidence in work.

### 苏南普遍训练区乡干部  总结工作整顿作风学习土改政策着重克服命令主义自私自利思想

　　苏南普遍训练区乡干部
    总结工作整顿作风学习土改政策
    着重克服命令主义自私自利思想
    【本报讯】据苏南日报消息：苏南各地区、乡干部，自六月中旬以来陆续开始了整风和土改学习。除个别地区采用会议方式进行整风外，一般均采用了集中轮训方式。松江专区已举办了三期训练班，共训练干部五百八十八人；苏州举办了一期，四百一十二人；常州举办了一期，四百三十五人；镇江办一期，三百八十人；吴县、无锡县委各办一期，约五百人。八月份以后，各地委、县委举办的轮训班均已普遍开始。十月份以前，苏南全区将有二万三千左右区乡干部整训完毕。
    八月以前，整风运动尚处在初期阶段，各地区、乡干部的整训，虽已获得若干成绩，但其整训方法与要求均不甚明确，领导上重视的程度也有所不同，因此在布置上和效果上也就不一样。如松江地区已办的三期训练班，均以土改学习与总结、布置工作为主，却没有进行专门的整风学习，因此在整顿干部的思想作风方面就没有收到多大效果。无锡县委第一期训练班，是以三分之二的时间进行整风学习，三分之一的时间学习土改。他们曾反复进行了整风学习的动员，但因一开始时即阅读文件，而对这一工作又未好好组织，特别是领导上未能更多的作些系统的专门报告，致一般干部虽对命令主义、贪污腐化等错误思想作风作了揭发和批评，但思想、政治水平并没有得到应有的提高。
    八月份以来，区、乡干部训练班普遍开始。由于各地委、县委、区委的主要干部曾参加了第一期苏南党校的整风学习，初步获得了领导整风的经验，因此从各地轮训计划及轮训之初的情形来看，较八月份以前已有显著进步。如常熟县委乡干训练班整风计划中，明确提出了整风重点是克服命令主义、自私自利等脱离群众的不良思想作风。基本方法是“研究报告、讨论典型、检查工作、总结经验，开展批评与自我批评”。并规定根据土改八项纪律和本县具体情况，由县委做“怎样做一个好干部”、“怎样为人民服务”两个报告。报告以后，进行两天到两天半时间的讨论，然后进一步进行好坏事例的典型示范报告，启发大家分清是非，掌握原则，学会正确地运用批评与自我批评的武器。在这一基础上开展普遍的自我检查，做出个人总结，并表明克服缺点、改进工作的决心。溧阳县委的整风计划中规定检查工作为整风的主要方法。在检查一年来各项主要工作中，以成功与失败，服从领导与不服从领导，作风正派与不正派的对比方式，来检查与总结工作经验，并联系检查个人的思想作风。镇江地委于七月二十二日召开了专区各县土改典型乡实验工作会议。在会议上与会干部进行了六天的整风学习。主要方法是自上而下检查工作，开展批评与自我批评，找出毛病根源，提高干部政治认识。在检查阶段中，首先由各县领导干部，通过检查工作，进行自我检查，并充分发扬民主，组织大家讨论和提意见。经过这样的启发，一般干部发现了自己的许多错误，开展了自我批评与相互批评。并能首先从分析情况着手，提高到思想原则上来认识问题。
    从各地乡级干部整风情况来看，如下的几点体验，应在今后乡级干部整风中予以注意：
    （一）乡级干部的整风学习，应从启发和提高阶级觉悟，树立全心全意为人民服务的革命观点着手，用作报告，反复说明正面的道理，并组织深刻讨论的方式收效较大，不必强求阅读文件；（二）乡级干部整风重点一般是以克服命令主义和自私自利为主，不应并列许多内容，否则反使主要问题不得解决；（三）乡级干部整风同样是要紧紧掌握检查工作的方法，但领导干部必须首先进行从上而下的检查，分析情况，找出工作中的主要问题，并联系检查领导思想和作风，使大家懂得如何进行检查与分析；（四）检查工作应着重分析缺点和错误，但又须指出成绩与优点，以提高工作信心。
