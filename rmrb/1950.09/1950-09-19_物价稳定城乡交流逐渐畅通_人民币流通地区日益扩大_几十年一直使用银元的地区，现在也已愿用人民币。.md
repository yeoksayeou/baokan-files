(Xinhua News Agency, September 15th) Since price stabilization in March, the speed of currency circulation has gradually returned to normal, and the circulation area has also been expanding daily. Especially after the wheat harvest, currency has been dispersing and circulating from cities to rural areas. Currently, Renminbi has become the primary means of exchange in vast urban and rural areas, thus promoting the development of urban-rural material exchange.

In the old liberated areas that have undergone land reform, due to the establishment of new urban-rural mutual assistance relationships, the purchasing power of farmers has increased compared to before. Therefore, after currency stabilization, with the development of urban-rural trade, Renminbi has rapidly and universally flowed into towns and villages. Renminbi first became the standard of value and means of circulation in the old liberated areas. As early as June this year, transactions in Shandong towns were generally conducted in Renminbi, and rural transactions were also mainly in Renminbi. Currency transactions accounted for about 80-90% of market transactions, and barter trade decreased significantly compared to before. In the vicinity of Baoding, barter trade accounted for only 2% of total transactions. In Mancheng mountainous area, Hebei, it was no more than 8%. In the past, the people of Inner Mongolia trusted silver dollars the most, but now they refuse to use silver dollars and are happy to accept Renminbi. Secondly, Renminbi has also begun to be used by the people as a means of storage. In Shandong, the storage time of Renminbi in the hands of farmers is generally about ten days to half a month. Farmers in Yangshan and Xinji areas of Mancheng, Hebei, save an average of around 2,000 yuan per day.

In the newly liberated areas that have not undergone land reform, in the past, due to the lack of smooth urban-rural trade and the low purchasing power of farmers, coupled with the people's long-term habit of using silver dollars (foreign currency was more commonly circulated in South China), there was insufficient trust in Renminbi. Therefore, the circulation of Renminbi in rural areas was not widespread initially. However, since price stabilization, Renminbi's position has rapidly expanded. In Guangdong Province, Renminbi has largely occupied the market in general towns and cities, and it is also widely circulated in half of the rural areas. In the Chaoshan area, the population using Renminbi accounted for about 10-20% of the total population in February, but it has now increased to 60-70%. In Fujian, the ratio of Renminbi to silver dollars and foreign currency received by stores in towns has changed from 1:1 before March to the current 9:1. In Southern Jiangsu, the population using Renminbi has reached 80%. In Yunnan Province, the number of county towns circulating Renminbi increased from only 20 before the end of April to 98 in July. Renminbi is also widely circulated in rural areas of Mengzi, Qujing, and Chuxiong prefectures. Some of these areas had been using silver dollars for decades, but now they no longer use silver dollars and are willing to use Renminbi.

The basic reason why Renminbi has been able to penetrate rural areas in the past five months is that currency has been stabilized. Secondly, urban-rural trade has gradually become smoother. From the perspective of currency entering rural areas in various places, in places with special products or export materials, the commodity economy is more developed, and Renminbi enters rural areas faster and in greater quantities. For example, during the season when Anhui tea and Zhejiang silk cocoons are on the market, state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private merchants go to the countryside to purchase them, and Renminbi therefore enters the countryside in greater quantities.

The current problems in the process of Renminbi entering rural areas are: in the old areas, due to the incomplete smooth flow of urban-rural material exchanges, farmers in some places cannot sell their products and cannot obtain currency to realize their purchasing power, so the phenomenon of barter trade still exists in rural areas; in the new areas, the position of Renminbi in towns and cities is not yet consolidated. The reason is that a considerable amount of silver dollars are still circulating and there is barter trade in rural areas, especially in mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation or areas where social order is not completely stable, the circulation of Renminbi is less.

　　物价稳定城乡交流逐渐畅通
    人民币流通地区日益扩大
    几十年一直使用银元的地区，现在也已愿用人民币。
    【新华社十五日讯】自三月份物价稳定以来，货币流转速度渐趋正常，流通地区亦日益扩大。尤其是麦收以后，货币更由城市向农村分散流通。现在广大城镇与农村中，人民币已成为主要的交换手段，因而促进了城乡物资交流的发展。
    在经过土地改革的老解放区，由于新的城乡互助关系开始建立，农民的购买力已较前提高，因此通货稳定之后，随着城乡贸易的发展，人民币即迅速而普遍地流到城镇和农村去。人民币在老解放区首先是成为计价标准和流通手段。还在今年六月间，山东城镇中的交易一般即以人民币进行，乡村交易亦以人民币为主，货币交易约占市场交易的十之八九，物物交换较前大减。在保定附近实物交易则仅占总交易量的百分之二。河北满城山区也不过百分之八。内蒙人民过去最信任银元，现在已拒绝使用银元而乐于接受人民币。其次，人民币并已开始被人民作为储藏手段。山东人民币在农民手中储存时间一般都在十天到半个月左右，河北满城羊山、辛集等地农民，平均每日保存货币在两千元上下。
    在未经土地改革的新解放区，过去由于城乡贸易尚未畅通，农民购买力较低，加以人民有长期使用银元习惯（华南则多流通外币）对人民币信任不够，因此人民币最初在农村中流通尚不普遍。但自物价稳定以来，人民币的阵地也已迅速扩大。广东省人民币在一般市镇已大部占领市场，在乡村也有二分之一的地区普遍流通，潮汕区使用人民币人口在二月间约占总人口的十分之一、二，现已增至十分之六、七。福建城镇商店售货收进人民币与银元外币之比例已由三月以前的一比一改变为现在的九比一。苏南使用人民币人口已达十分之八。云南省在四月底以前流通人民币的县城只有二十个，到七月份即增至九十八个，在蒙自、曲靖、楚雄等专区农村中，亦已普遍流通人民币。这些地区有的是几十年来一直使用银元的，现在也都不用银元而愿用人民币了。
    五个月来，人民币所以能深入农村，基本原因是通货业已稳定，其次是由于城乡贸易逐渐畅通。从各地货币下乡情况来看，凡有特产或出口物资的地方，因商品经济较发达，人民币下乡较快而且也较多。如皖南茶叶、浙江丝茧上市季节，国营贸易公司、合作社与私商下乡收购，人民币因此下乡较多。
    目前人民币下乡过程中存在的问题是：在老区由于城乡物资交流尚未完全畅通，有些地方农民手中的产品卖不出去，不能取得货币以实现其购买力，因此农村中以物易物现象还存在；在新区城镇中人民币的阵地还不巩固，原因是农村中尚有相当数量的银元流通与实物交易，特别是在交通不便的山地、或社会秩序不完全稳定的地区，人民币流通就较少。
