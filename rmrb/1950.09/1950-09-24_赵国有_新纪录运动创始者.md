　　Zhao Guoyou
　　——Founder of the New Record Movement
　　Tian Liu
    The liberated Northeast working class is engaged in a vigorous mass movement to create new records. This movement began in August and September of 1949. In just four months, more than 50,000 advanced producers created more than 20,000 new records in various fields, increasing overall labor productivity by more than 32%. In the first half of this year, another 13,893 new record creators emerged. Therefore, although the industrial production plan has been increased by nearly 100% compared to last year, thanks to the leadership of advanced producers in various factories, most of the plans are completed and exceeded month by month and quarter by quarter.
    Currently, the movement to create new production records in the Northeast is flourishing and rapidly developing in breadth and depth. From the industrialized South Manchuria area bristling with smokestacks to the vast forests of the Hinggan Mountains, from factories to mines, the prairie fire of creating new records is burning everywhere. It is advancing rapidly towards improving business management, implementing the responsibility system, improving technology, improving quality, and implementing economic accounting. It has changed and is changing the industrial landscape of the Northeast, shortening the course of the motherland's industrialization, and promoting the motherland's industry towards a new high tide.
    How did this movement develop? Who ignited the prairie fire of the new record movement for building Northeast industry?
　“Are they gods?”
    In July 1949, when the news that the Fourth Machine Factory in Shenyang could turn a "turret wheel" in four hours reached the Third Factory, no one in the Third Factory believed it. Who could believe it? Since ancient times, no one had ever heard of anyone being able to turn out a turret wheel in four hours. Besides, in terms of technology, the Third Factory was no worse than the Fourth Factory; in terms of equipment, it was no worse than the Fourth Factory; in terms of history, it started work in November 1948 after liberation, no later than the Fourth Factory. Speaking of the work of the Third Factory in various aspects, it has been improving month by month. When the production of lathes started in April, it took 24 hours to turn a turret wheel. After the Red May competition, the workers improved the tools, improved their skills, and worked hard. The fastest time has been reduced to eight hours, and efficiency has been doubled. The highest record in the puppet Manchukuo era was still five hours. "Four hours"? Who believes it? "Are they gods?" Everyone discussed, "Otherwise, they have four hands." Nie Bingju, the director of the trade union, said, "If you don't believe it, let's go to the Fourth Factory to have a look." Sure enough, it was four hours, not a minute off. Everyone returned with red faces. "What to do?" Zhang Shangju, a Communist Party member, thought to himself after returning to the factory. Zhao Guoyou, a member of the Communist Youth League, also thought: "I am also a lathe worker. People make two while I only make one. What to do?" Everyone kept silent, but no one was convinced. Comrade Nie Bingju, the director of the trade union, saw this momentum and held a meeting that night to mobilize the workers to "catch up with the four-hour record." The Communist Youth League branch also held a meeting of League members. The organizing committee member said, "Did you see it? They can finish it in four hours. Which of our League members dares to challenge the Fourth Factory?" Most of the League members were apprentices who had just entered the factory. Although there were a few young skilled workers, their skills were not very good. Zhao Guoyou saw that everyone was lowering their heads. He thought that I had been a worker for eleven or twelve years, and my skills were better than those of other League members. Although I didn't specialize in making turret wheels, if I couldn't break through this point, the factory's production movement would not be able to move forward. This should be the time for League members to take the lead. So he stood up bravely: "I am willing to challenge the Fourth Factory." After the meeting, Zhao Guoyou met Zhang Shangju, who had just held a Party member meeting and was worried about this matter. As soon as the two met, Zhang Shangju spoke first: "What to do?" Zhao Guoyou knew that it was about that matter again, so he replied, "Whatever you say, we'll do it." "If you can make one in four hours, I guarantee to shorten the scribing time of my six-foot lathe from 180 hours to 90 hours." The two of them went to the works section to request a task, and the works section agreed to Lao Zhao's request and allowed him to make turret wheels on August 1st. So the two of them started competing.
　　Difficulties abound
    After the administration agreed to let Zhao Guoyou make turret wheels, Lao Zhao was both surprised and happy. He was surprised that the "work" that used to take ten hours to do now had to be done in four hours, which was not a simple matter and would definitely be difficult. He was happy that he was the first to respond to the call of the Youth League and competed with Party members, setting an example and not disgracing the title of Communist Youth League member. He was determined to complete this difficult but glorious task. So he first went to the workshop where turret wheels were made to study the reasons why the workers were slow in making turret wheels. He saw that everyone was working hard, no one was lazy, and they were all working hard, but they couldn't get the job done. They all wanted to add more effort, but the tools were not up to par. The milling cutter rods were like suffering from malaria, shaking constantly. When the cutter touched the material, it would bounce back. The pointed knife for turning the outer skin was like a silkworm eating mulberry leaves, nibbling little by little. It took a long time to turn one step. A turret wheel has four steps. How much time would it take? He thought that relying on strength alone would not work. He had to find a way to transform the tools. But it was easier said than done. How could he transform them? It was really difficult. Seeing that August 1st was approaching, he still didn't have a clue in his mind. Lao Zhao was anxious and kept walking back and forth, thinking about transforming the tools. In those days, Lao Zhao was really restless and uneasy. He dreamed of transforming tools for several nights. Sure enough, nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it. Any difficulty can be overcome as long as you are determined. After Zhao Guoyou's devoted study, the new tools were finally created by him at the end of July. He first thickened the milling cutter rod, then changed the milling cutter to a double-edged blade, and also made a round milling cutter the same size as the eye of the turret wheel. He designed a template knife the same size as the bulge of the turret wheel (that is, the place where the belt runs) to replace the original spring knife. On August 2nd, he tested the new tools and succeeded. The cutter rod no longer trembled, and the double-edged milling cutter kept cutting inward without pushing the cutter back. When the inside was milled almost completely with the milling cutter, the eye was successfully milled with the round milling cutter. The outer skin was complete as soon as it was relied on with the large template knife. On August 4th, he created a new record of two hours and twenty minutes, breaking through the "highest standard" of five hours in the puppet Manchukuo era, and surpassing the four-hour record of the Fourth Factory. The director of the trade union said: "This is a new record!" Thus, the term "creating a new record" was called out. Thousands of workers cheered, applauded, and congratulated Zhao Guoyou, who created the new record. The trade union put his deeds on the wall newspaper, the Party and the Youth League commended and encouraged him, and the factory director also called on all workers to learn from Lao Zhao. It was really very lively, and the whole factory was stirred up. Everyone said: "Zhao Guoyou has created a new record!"
    At that time, Shenyang had been liberated for less than a year. Although most workers had improved their class consciousness and made progress in their understanding under the education and leadership of the Party and the People's Government, many workers had not completely changed their old thinking because they had been deceived too deeply by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bureaucratic bourgeoisie. They thought that "no matter who runs the factory, they are always trying to get the workers to work more and suffer more." They did not realize that the liberated Chinese working class had become the leading class of the country, the masters of the country, and that the hard work now was for the people of the whole country and also for the happy life of the working class themselves. On the contrary, they thought that Zhao Guoyou's hard work and fast output were kicking their own rice bowls. So some people became dissatisfied with Lao Zhao, mocking him, satirizing him, and some workers even ran up to Lao Zhao and said to his face: "Lao Zhao, you are so glorious, the factory director has praised you and will reward you well. Work hard, die of exhaustion and you'll get labor insurance. You strive to be the first to enjoy it!" It was really infuriating. He took pains to transform the tools and solve the difficulties in production, but he was ridiculed by backward elements. He overcame old difficulties and new difficulties came. Lao Zhao felt annoyed in his heart and really wanted to lose his temper with the backward elements. But when he thought that he was a member of the Communist Youth League, he could not lose his temper with everyone. As long as he didn't get impatient, he would think more clearly after calming down. Lao Zhao knew that the workers were all like him, had suffered hardships, and would wake up tomorrow if they were backward today. Once he understood the reason, he became even more concerned and sympathetic to them. So he patiently explained to them: "Comrades, I am not seeking fame and profit for myself, but to improve the production of our factory. In the past, we could be fired anytime even if we ate bean cakes. Now we are the masters of the country. Not only is our livelihood guaranteed, but the factory director accepts our workers' opinions on all matters in the factory." He also said: "We are liberated, but many workers are still suffering. Let's produce more and faster to save them." He also helped Yu Qinglu, Zhang Zhenshan and other workers transform their tools so that they could also create new records. Some workers turned around under his influence, but a few individuals were still dissatisfied with him. Seeing that satire and ridicule were ineffective, these people ran to his wife to stir up trouble: "Quickly persuade him. The workers all hate him. Besides, working so desperately will ruin his health. Aren't you distressed?" It was very disappointing. He was ridiculed by backward elements at the factory during the day, and his wife didn't even give him a good look at night. At first, Lao Zhao patiently explained, but his wife either nagged and entangled him or pouted and ignored him. Lao Zhao got anxious and lay aside and got angry. Turning from side to side, he remembered the past.
　　Thinking it over
    If he didn't think about the past, it would be fine. But once he thought about it, he remembered his father who suffered all his life: the old man herded pigs for the landlord at the age of nine, in wind and rain, eating and sleeping with the pigs. The pigs grew fatter day by day, and the father grew thinner day by day. When he was older, he worked as a farmhand for the landlord. He worked all day with his back to the sky and his face to the ground. His spine was bent from exhaustion, but he could not get enough food and clothing. Later, he carried a peddler's pole and ran around the countryside all day, selling things to support his family. In order to give his son a good life, he often carried the pole all day without eating a bite, and went home on an empty stomach. He saved a few coins and sent himself to elementary school. In that society, how could poor children go to school? In 1938, he barely graduated from elementary school and could no longer continue his studies. In the old society, the children of poor families could not only not go to school, but even being a slave for the rich was not something they could do casually! In order to enter the puppet "Manchurian Work Office" as an apprentice, his aunt sold the only cloth shirt she was wearing and bought eggs and foreign wine to give as gifts, just to buy himself a slave status. From the age of fifteen when he became an apprentice until liberation, a full ten years, he tasted all kinds of hardships. He couldn't eat enough, couldn't wear enough. The children were young, and they couldn't stand eating bean cakes like adults, and they got sick. He wanted to withdraw some wages in advance to see a doctor for the children, but the factory director not only refused, but also wanted to dismiss him. Because he had no money, he watched his child die...
    "People have to have a conscience. What was life like then, and what is life like now." Zhao Guoyou couldn't help but shout out when he thought of his sadness. Thinking about the past and looking at the present, not only is work guaranteed after liberation, but life is getting better day by day. Now the family has both sorghum and rice, and the clothes and shoes are all new. Where did they come from? Why not work hard? Not long after liberation, the trade union sent him to the workers' training class to study. "My parents had no way to support me in school, but the Party and the Youth League are cultivating and educating me like this. Who am I betraying if I don't work hard?" So the next morning, as usual, when the whistle blew, Zhao Guoyou was already concentrating, excitedly and happily turning his turret wheel. Therefore, when the factory director advised him: "Backward elements will soon change, don't be discouraged if they are mocking you now," Zhao Guoyou said: "I don't care about these things at all."
    With the support and encouragement of the factory director and the trade union, and under the education of the Party and the Communist Youth League, Zhao Guoyou worked even harder, striving for perfection. As his skills became more and more proficient, and he improved his operating methods, using a combination of turning and milling, he created a new record of one hour and sixteen minutes on September 14, and an even higher record of fifty minutes in December. The newspaper published his photos and glorious deeds, the film team made a film of him, the radio station invited him to broadcast, the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government awarded him a bonus, and also made a special decision to call on all workers to learn from him, and all factories and mines to carry out the new record movement. The factory rewarded him with fifty feet of cloth. Everyone saw that the world was really different. Such a small matter was such a big deal! The workers were all envious and worked hard, and they all started creating new records. Zhang Guoshi, who had ridiculed Zhao Guoyou, didn't stop working even with a swollen foot, and secretly chased after Zhao Guoyou. Dang Huian reduced the time for turning lead screws from thirty hours to two hours and thirty-seven minutes. Many workers said: "I'll create one too!" At this time, Lao Zhao's wife was also happy. When Lao Zhao came back from work, he always greeted him with a smile, the food was prepared early, and he often asked with a smile: "Have you created a new record again?"
    The news of Zhao Guoyou's creation of a new record spread all over the Northeast like a gust of wind. From Anshan, Benxi, Fushun, and from more distant factories and mines, letters signed with the names of many workers were constantly sent to Shenyang, to Zhao Guoyou. Some congratulated him, some asked him to introduce his experience, and all wanted to "learn from Zhao Guoyou" and "catch up with Zhao Guoyou." By the end of October, a mass movement of creating new records involving hundreds of thousands of labor troops had formed throughout the Northeast. From factories to mines, from heavy industry to light industry, the prairie fire of creating new records was burning everywhere. At the beginning of 1950, it spread to Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and the distant border areas. The movement to create new production records has become and is becoming the regular labor mode and lifestyle of the liberated Chinese working class.
　　Going abroad and entering Beijing
    The people's motherland gives the highest honor to the heroic workers. Due to Zhao Guoyou's outstanding achievements in the battle line of building the motherland's industry, from October 1949 - from the month when he created a new record and launched the movement of hundreds of thousands of workers in the Northeast to create new records - he was elected by thousands of working people as their representative to participate in the Shenyang Municipal People's Congress, the Shenyang Municipal Workers' Congress, and the Northeast Regional People's Congress. In November, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In April 1950, he also participated in the delegation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to the Soviet Union to celebrate the "May Day" International Labor Day as an outstanding representative of the Chinese working class. In Red Square in Moscow, he, together with the Soviet working people, admired the leader and mentor of the world's working people and our dear friend - the great Comrade Stalin, and conveyed the Chinese people's loyal support and unbreakable friendship to the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, he visited the machine factory in Leningrad and many other factories, and met many of the most outstanding Stakhanovite workers in the Soviet Union. A young man who strives for progress always looks ahead. Zhao Guoyou learned a lot of knowledge and production experience in the Soviet Union. After participating in the "May Day" celebration, he saw the powerful Soviet Red Army equipped with high science and technology, and the determination and will of the entire Soviet people to defend world peace. He wrote in his diary: "Participating in this 'May Day' Congress has given me unparalleled strength. I will work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union." So he went to many factories to visit and learn their advanced science and technology and experience. He asked the outstanding Soviet Stakhanovite worker, lathe operator Burtogaevich, to introduce all his experience. He visited the finished product inspection-free workshop of the Leningrad Machine Factory, and saw that more than 200 workers were Stakhanovite workers, and he was determined to be a product inspection-free worker and create a model workshop when he returned to his production post. After further seeing the great achievements of the Soviet Union's construction and the happy life of the people, when he left the Soviet Union and returned to China, he was full of hope and confidence. He said: "Seeing the happy life of the Soviet workers, I also see the prospects for the life of Chinese workers. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, as long as we work hard, we will definitely reach the same level as the Soviet workers."
    After returning to China, he happened to be invited to attend the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During the meeting, Chairman Mao invited them to dinner, toasted them, and took photos with them for permanent memorial. According to the old thinking of the old society: having been abroad and entered Beijing, having eaten and taken photos with the supreme leader of the country, would he never return to the factory to work as a worker?
　　Forever forward
    Comrade Zhao Guoyou returned to Shenyang from Beijing, and went to the factory without even entering his home. After turning around in various departments of the factory, meeting with the factory director, engineers, and responsible comrades of the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, and all the workers, he took off his clothes, put on his work clothes, and returned to his workshop. He picked up his tools, started his machine and started working. Under the kind teachings of Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and influenced by the noble qualities and excellent work style of Soviet workers, Zhao Guoyou further understood that in the people's motherland, in the people's era, labor is the highest honor. Therefore, he loves labor even more and works even harder. He always completes and exceeds the tasks assigned to him by the state month by month. He gave a detailed introduction to the advanced experience of the model workshop he learned in the Soviet Union to the factory administration and the trade union, and proposed that his own workshop, the Second Workshop, be used as a trial workshop to "turn it into a model workshop as a gift to welcome National Day." The factory director approved his proposal, and Lao Zhao organized all the workers in the workshop to study, discuss, and formulate a production plan and management system to improve the workshop. Over the past few months, great achievements have been made under the joint efforts of all the staff in the workshop. In June, the Second Workshop produced six defective products. In July, after Lao Zhao returned from Beijing and organized the model workshop movement, the number of defective products was reduced to one. Because he transformed the tool for tapping the spindle bore of the lathe in July, the standard product rate increased from 47.5% in June to 64% in July. He also used Soviet experience to scientifically organize labor, dividing the "turning roughing," "cutting the thread," and "polishing the bore" into three processes according to the complexity of the technology and the level of proficiency, forming a formal assembly line. In addition, he improved the operating method of grinding the top center, reducing the time for making the spindle bore of the lathe from 77 hours in June to 29 hours, increasing efficiency by more than half, and further reducing it to 20 hours in August. In terms of quality, not only were defective products eliminated, but there were no third-class products or substandard products. He also helped others transform their tools. In the past, curved plates were used to make "helical rates," and lines had to be drawn to find the correct position. After he and his fellow workers researched and transformed the tools, the working hours were reduced by 5%. The quality was also better than before.
    Zhao Guoyou is not only a model advanced producer, but also a very good political propaganda and mobilization worker. He always uses his rest time to tirelessly introduce the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union to the workers, often helps the trade union's cultural and educational committee members to run wall newspapers, and often goes into the group of young workers to talk to them about current events and technical skills, helping them to make progress together politically and technically. He is also a correspondent for eight Party and trade union newspapers and radio stations, including People's Daily, Northeast Daily, and Labor Daily, and often writes articles reporting on new achievements in production and exposing shortcomings and errors in work.
    Zhao Guoyou often said: "I will never let down the education and expectations of the Party and the people. I am a member of the working class, a glorious Communist Party member, and I will definitely use all my wisdom and labor to build our great motherland and consolidate our sacred cause." Zhao Guoyou's exemplary actions make everyone cherish him and support him even more. They not only elected him as a representative to participate in the National Congress of Labor, Peasants and Soldiers Model Workers, but also enthusiastically learned from him, just as he said in an article he wrote for the Soviet newspaper Pravda when he visited the Soviet Union: "Chinese workers have realized the greatness of Stakhanovite workers' work and are actively learning from this example. They are engaged in selfless labor to support the front-line People's Liberation Army in its operations." Because the liberated Chinese working class has such a shining example and pioneer as Zhao Guoyou, thousands of advanced producers are growing rapidly not only in the Northeast, but also in all production sectors throughout the country.

　　赵国有
    ——新纪录运动创始者
    田流
    解放了的东北工人阶级，正在进行着轰轰烈烈的创造新纪录运动。这个运动从一九四九年八、九月间开始，仅在四个月内就有五万多先进生产者，创造了两万多件各方面的新纪录，使总的劳动生产率提高百分之三十二以上。今年前半年又涌现出一三、八九三名新纪录创造者。因此，虽然工业生产计划比去年提高近一倍，但在各工厂先进生产者带动下，大部分总是月月完成，季季超过着。
    现在，东北区的创造生产新纪录运动正方兴未艾地向着广泛和深入迅速发展。从烟囱林立的南满工业区到兴安岭上遮蔽天日的大森林里，从工厂到矿山，到处都燃烧着创造新纪录的燎原大火。它正向着改善经营管理、贯彻责任制、改进技术、提高质量、实行经济核算制的方向大步前进。它已经改变了并正改变着东北的工业面貌，缩短着祖国工业化的历程，促进着祖国工业奔向新的高潮。
    这个运动是怎样发展起来的？是谁点燃起建设东北工业的创造新纪录运动的燎原大火呢？
  “难道他们是神手？”
    一九四九年七月，沈阳第四机器厂四点钟就能车一个“塔轮”的消息刚传到三厂时，三厂工人谁也不信——谁能相信呢？自古至今就没听说过谁能四点钟车出一个塔轮。再说，论技术，三厂比四厂不低；论设备，也不比四厂坏；论历史，一九四八年十一月解放，就开工了，比四厂也不晚。说到三厂各方面的工作，更是月月进步，四月开始生产车床时，是二十四点钟车一个塔轮，红五月竞赛后，工人们改进了工具，提高了技术，蹩足劲的干，最快的已经降到八小时，效率提高两倍。伪满时最高纪录还要五小时呢，他们“四小时”，谁信哪？“难道他们是神手？”大家纷纷议论“要不，他们就长着四只手。”工会主任聂秉举就说：“大家不信，咱们到四厂看看去。”一看，真是四点钟，一点不差，大家红着脸回来了。“咋整呢？”回厂后共产党员张尚举心里想。青年团员赵国有心里也想：“咱也是个车工，人家作两个咱才作一个，咋整呢？”大家嘴里不说话，可心里谁也不服，工会主任聂秉举同志看出大家这股劲头，当天夜里就开会，动员工人“赶过四小时的纪录去”。青年团支部也召开团员大会，组织委员说：“看见了吧，人家四点钟就能完，咱们团员谁敢和四厂挑战？”团员大部是入厂不久的徒工，虽有少数青年技术工人，但技术也不太好，赵国有一看大家都低着头，他想我是十一、二年的工人了，论技术比别的团员同志强，虽说我不是专作塔轮的，但突不破这一点，全厂的生产运动就不能向前发展一步，这该是团员起带头作用的时候了，于是就勇敢的站起来：“我愿和四厂挑战。”会后，赵国有遇见了张尚举，他也是刚开过党员会，正为这件事情着急呢。二人一见面，张尚举先开口：“咋整呢？”赵国有一听就知道又为那事，就回答道：“你说咋整就咋整。”“你要能四小时作一个，我的六英尺车床划线保证由一百八十小时，缩短到九十小时。”两个人就一同去找工务股要求任务，工务股同意了老赵的请求，允许八月一日调他去作塔轮，于是两个人就比赛起来了。
  困难重重
    行政上答应赵国有去作塔轮后，老赵心里又惊又喜。惊的是过去十来个钟头的“活”，要四点钟做出来，不是那么简单的事，一定困难很多，喜的是自己首先响应了团的号召，又和党员竞赛，起了先锋带头作用，没有辱没了青年团员的称号。他下了决心要完成这个虽很困难却很光荣的任务。于是他先到作塔轮的厂房，研究工友们作塔轮出活慢的原因。他看到工友们人人努力，没有一个懒散的，都是一个劲的干，就是赶不出活来，都想再加一把劲，可是工具不争气，铣刀杆子就像发疟疾，一个劲的抖，吃上刀就挡回来啦，车外皮的尖刀，又像蚕吃桑叶，一点一点的啃，车一个台台就得好一会，一个塔轮有四个台台，得多少时间啊？他想光靠力气不行，得想法改造工具，但说起来容易，又怎么改造法呢？真是困难重重，眼看八月一日就到了，自己心里还没有门道，急的老赵走过来走过去地都在想着改造工具的事。那几天真是闹的老赵坐卧不宁，寝食不安，有好几个晚上作梦都是改造工具。果然，天下无难事，就怕不用心，任何困难，只要下决心都能克服的。经过赵国有的专心钻研，新工具终于被他在七月底创造出来了。他先把铣刀杆子加粗，又把铣刀改成两面刃，还做了个和塔轮里眼一样大小的圆铣刀，设计了一个和塔轮鼓肚（就是那跑皮带的地方）一样大的样板刀，代替原来用的弹簧刀。八月二日试验新工具，成功了。刀杆不再颤抖，两面刃的铣刀一直往里划不再向回摚刀，等用铣刀将里面铣的差不多时，用圆铣刀一铣里眼就成功了。外皮用大样板刀一靠，也就全完啦。一下子八月四日创出个两点二十分的纪录，冲破了伪满五小时的“最高标准”，超越了四厂四小时的纪录。工会主任说：“这是新纪录！”于是“创造新纪录”的名词就叫开了。上千的工友围着创出新纪录的赵国有欢呼、鼓掌、庆贺。工会把他的事迹登上墙报，党和团表扬他、鼓励他，厂长也号召全体工人向老赵学习，真是搞得热烈非常，全厂惊动。人人都说：“赵国有创造新纪录啦！”
    那时，沈阳解放还不到一年，虽说大多数工友在党和人民政府教育、领导下，阶级觉悟提高了，认识进步了。但还有不少工人，因为受日寇和国民党官僚资产阶级的欺骗太深，旧脑筋没有完全改变过来，认为“不论谁办工厂，也是想着法叫工人多干活，多受累”，没有认清解放了的中国工人阶级已成了国家的领导阶级，国家的主人了，现在努力生产是为了全国人民，也是为了工人阶级自己的幸福生活。反认为赵国有干活多、出活快是踢自己的饭碗子。于是有些人就对老赵不满起来，嘲笑他，讽刺他，还有的工人跑到老赵跟前面对面的说：“老赵，你真光荣，厂长都表扬你，还要好好奖励你呢，使劲干吧，累死了有劳动保险金，你争取享头一份吧！”，真叫人恼火，费心费力，改造了工具解决了生产上的困难，却遇到了落后分子的嘲笑，克服了旧的困难又来了新的困难，老赵心里一烦燥，真想对落后分子发作几句，但一想自己是青年团员，不能跟大家发脾气，只要不急燥，平心静气一想，事儿就更明白了。老赵知道工友们都和自己一样，受过苦，今天落后，明天就会觉悟起来的。道理一想通，他反倒更关心更同情他们了。于是就耐心的给他们解释道：“同志，我不是为个人图名得利，是为把咱工厂生产搞好。过去吃豆饼还不定那天被解雇。现在咱是国家的主人了，不光生活有保障啦，全厂的事，咱工人提意见，厂长都接受。”又说：“咱是解放了，还有许多工友在受苦哩，多生产，快生产好去救他们啊。”并帮助于庆禄、张振山等工友改造工具，使他们也创出新纪录。有些工友在他影响下转变过来，但还有个别人仍对他不满，这些人见讽刺、嘲笑都无效，就跑到他老婆那里挑拨去了：“快劝劝他吧，工人都恨他，再说这样拼死没活的干，把身子累坏了，你不心痛？”多败兴，白天在厂里受了落后分子的讥讽，晚上老婆还不给个好模样儿看。起初，老赵还耐着性儿解释，可是老婆不是唠唠叨叨纠缠不清，就是咕嘟着小嘴不答理。老赵一急，就睡在一边生起气来。左翻右转，就想起当年的往事来了。
  思前想后
    不想起往事便罢，一想就想起受苦终生的爹爹来了：老人家九岁就给地主放猪，风里来，雨里去，和猪吃在一起，睡在一处，猪一天天肥起来，父亲一天天瘦下去。年岁大些了又给地主扛长工，整日里背朝天脸朝地，脊骨都累弯了也得不到温饱，后来又挑个货郎担，终日四乡奔跑，卖点钱养家治口。为着使儿子有个好日子，常常担着担子跑一天不吃一口东西，空着肚子回家来，攒下了几个钱，把自己送入小学，那社会，穷孩子那能入学堂？一九三八年小学勉强毕了业再不能继续升学了。旧社会，穷苦人家的儿女，不仅不能入学读书，连给有钱人当奴隶都是不能随便当上的啊！为着入伪“满州工作所”当学徒，姑母把身上穿的仅有的一件布衫卖了，买上鸡蛋、洋酒去送礼，才算替自己买到了个奴隶身份。从十五岁当学徒起直到解放整整十年，啥苦都尝到了，吃不上，穿不上，孩子小，整天和大人一样吃豆饼抗不住，病了。想预支点工资给孩子看病，厂长不但不答应，还要辞退，因为没有钱，就眼睁睁的看着孩子死了……。
    “人得有良心啊，那时啥生活，如今啥生活。”赵国有想到伤心处，就不由自主的喊出声来。想想过去，看看现在，解放后不但工作有了保障，生活也一天比一天好起来了，如今家里又是高粱，又是大米，衣服鞋袜一满新，这是那儿来的？为啥不努力干？解放不久，工会又送自己入职工训练班学习，“爹娘没有办法供我上学，党和团竟这样培养教育我，不掏出心来干，又对住谁呢？”于是第二天早晨照样，当汽笛响的时候，赵国有早又在聚精会神兴奋愉快的车他的塔轮了。因此，当厂长劝他说：“落后分子很快就会转变的，眼时讽刺你，不要灰心”时，赵国有就说：“我满盘子就没在乎这些事。”
    在厂长、工会支持、鼓励下，在党和青年团教育下，赵国有干的更起劲了，精益求精，随着技术一天天熟练，并改进操作方法，运用车、铣联合操作法，九月十四日又创出了一点十六分的新纪录，十二月更创出了五十分钟的最高纪录。报上把他的像片和光荣事迹登出来，电影队给他拍成电影，广播电台请他去广播，东北人民政府工业部给他发了奖金，还专作了决定，号召全体工人向他学习，一切工厂、矿山都要开展新纪录运动。厂里奖给他五十尺布，大伙一看，世道真是不同了，这么点事还这么大举动呢！工友们人人羡慕，个个努力，都创造起新纪录来了。讽刺过赵国有的张国士肿着脚都不歇工，暗暗追赶赵国有，党会安车丝杠，由三十小时减少到二时三十七分，许多工友都说：“我他妈也创一个吧！”这时老赵的老婆也乐了，老赵下工回来，总是笑脸相迎，饭菜早预备好了，常常笑着问：“又创了个新纪录么？”
    赵国有创造新纪录的消息，一阵风就传遍了全东北，从鞍山、本溪、抚顺，从更远的工厂、矿山里，签着好多工人名子的信，不断的寄往沈阳，寄给赵国有。有的向他祝贺，有的请他介绍经验，都要“学习赵国有”，“追赶赵国有”。到十月下旬，在全东北已形成数十万劳动大军参加的，轰轰烈烈的创造新纪录的群众运动了，从工厂到矿山，从重工业到轻工业，到处燃烧起创造新纪录的燎原大火。一九五○年初更传到天津、北京、上海和遥远的边疆，创造生产新纪录运动，已经成为和正在成为解放了的中国工人阶级经常的劳动方式和生活方式。
  出国进京
    人民的祖国，给英勇劳动者以最高的荣誉。由于赵国有在建设祖国工业战线上的卓越成就，从一九四九年十月份起——从他创造新纪录，并掀起了全东北数十万工人群众创造新纪录运动的月份起，他便被万千劳动人民选举为自己的代表，参加了沈阳市人民代表会议，沈阳市职工代表大会和东北区人民代表会议。十一月份更光荣的参加了中国共产党。一九五○年四月，他又以中国工人阶级优秀代表的资格，参加了中华全国总工会代表团，赴苏联庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。在莫斯科红场上，他同苏联劳动人民在一起，瞻仰了世界劳动人民的领袖、导师和亲爱的朋友——伟大的斯大林同志，传达了中国人民对苏联的忠诚拥护和牢不可破的友谊。在苏联，他参观了列宁格勒的机器工厂和许多别的工厂，会见了许多苏联最优秀的斯达哈诺夫工作者。一个力求进步的青年，眼睛是永远向着前面的，赵国有在苏联学习了好多知识和生产经验，他参加了“五一”庆祝大会后，看见了为高度科学技术装备起来的强大无比的苏联红军，和全苏人民万众一心的保卫世界和平的决心和意志，他在日记上记道：“我参加了这个‘五一’大会，给我增加了无比的力量，我要努力学习苏联的先进经验。”于是他到许多工厂去参观，学习他们的先进科学技术和经验。他请苏联优秀的斯达哈诺夫工作者、旋盘工布尔脱盖维奇同志介绍他的全部经验。他参观了列宁格勒机器工厂的成品免检车间，看见二百多工人都是斯达哈诺夫工作者，决心回到生产岗位上也作个出品免检工作者和创造模范车间。当他进一步看到苏联建设的伟大成就和人民的幸福生活之后，离苏返国时，他充满了希望和信心，他说：“看到苏联工人的幸福生活，也就看到了中国工人生活的远景。在中国共产党领导下，只要我们努力，一定也会走到像苏联工人那样的地步。”
    回国后，适逢人民政协全国委员会举行第二次会议，赵国有又被邀列席参加了。会议期间，毛主席请他们吃饭，同他们干杯，又和他们在一起照了像留作永久纪念。按照旧社会的老想法：出过国进过京，同全国的最高领袖吃过饭照过像，再也不会回到工厂里当工人作工了吧？
  永远前进
    赵国有同志从北京回到沈阳，一下火车连家门也没入，就到工厂来了。在工厂里各部转了一圈，同厂长、工程师及党、工会、青年团负责同志和全体工友见一见面后，把衣服一脱，换上工服就回到自己的车间里。拿起工具开起机器作起工来。赵国有在毛主席的亲切教诲下，在全国总工会的领导及苏联工人高贵品质和优良作风影响下，更进一步懂得了在人民的祖国，人民的时代，劳动是最高的荣誉。因此，他更加热爱劳动，更加努力生产，他总是月月完成和超过国家给他的任务。他在苏联学到的模范车间的先进经验，回厂后就向工厂行政和工会作了详细的介绍，并提议以自己工作的第二车间为试验车间，“把它搞成模范车间，作为迎接国庆日的献礼。”厂长批准了他的提议，老赵便组织全车间工友研究、讨论、订出搞好车间的生产计划和管理制度，几个月来，在全车间职工的共同努力下，已经获得很大成绩。六月份第二车间出了六件废品，七月老赵从北京回来组织模范车间运动后，废品减少到一件。因为他七月份改造了掏车床主轴稍孔的工具，使标准品由六月份的百分之四十七·五升到七月份的百分之六十四。他更运用苏联经验，科学的组织劳动力，按照技术繁简和熟练程度，分“车荒”“挑扣”“光稍孔”三道工序，形成了正式的流水作业，加上他又改进了磨顶尖的操作方法，使作车床主轴稍孔的时间，由六月份的七十七小时，降为二十九小时，效率提高一倍半还多，八月份又降到二十小时。质量上不但消灭了废品，还没有了三等品和下级品，他还帮助别人改造工具，过去作“螺旋率”用湾板，得划线找正，经他同工友研究改造工具后，缩短工时百分之五。质量还比过去好。
    赵国有不仅是一个模范的先进生产者，还是个很好的政治宣传鼓动工作者，他总是利用休息的时间，不知疲劳的向工友们介绍苏联的先进生产经验，经常帮助工会文教委员搞墙报，经常钻到青年工人群里和他们谈时事，讲技术，从政治上技术上帮助他们一齐进步。他还是人民日报、东北日报、劳动日报等八个党的、工会的报纸和广播电台的通讯员，经常写稿报道生产上的新成就，揭发工作中的缺点和错误。
    赵国有常说：“我绝不辜负党和人民对我的教育和期待，我是工人阶级，是光荣的共产党员，一定用我全部的智慧和劳动，建设我们的伟大祖国，巩固我们的神圣事业。”赵国有的模范行动，使得大家更爱护他、拥戴他。他们不仅选他为参加全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表，而且更热烈的向他学习，正像他在苏联参观时，给苏联真理报写的一篇文章中所说：“中国工人们已经认识到斯达哈诺夫式工人工作的伟大，并且积极学习这种范例了，他们正以忘我的劳动从事生产以支援前线人民解放军的作战。”解放了的中国工人阶级，因为有了赵国有这样光辉的榜样和先导，千千万万的先进生产者，不仅在东北，而是在全国各个生产部门中迅速的生长着。（附图片）
