Longyan and Yongding Counties, Fujian Province
Consoling Revolutionary Masses and Families of Martyrs, Assisting Revolutionary Base Villages to Rebuild Their Homes

[Report from this newspaper] The people's governments of Longyan and Yongding counties in Fujian Province are consoling revolutionary masses and the families of fallen martyrs who have persisted in fighting against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang for many years. They are also assisting the people of revolutionary base villages since the land revolution to restore production and rebuild their homes. Since the armed uprising of the people of western Fujian in 1929 under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the revolutionary base areas of various counties in the Longyan Special District have suffered more than twenty years of bloody devastation by the Kuomintang reactionaries through "repeated encirclement and suppression," "relocation of villages," arson, murder, and looting. According to incomplete statistics, the number of households devastated in Longyan County reached 3,106, with 709 houses and 2,193 rooms burned, 1,400 households forcibly relocated, and more than 580 people buried alive, shot, or died in prison. In Wan'an District, the number of devastated households accounted for about half of the total population of the district. The situation in Yongding County (lacking materials from Fengshi City District) was even more serious, with more than 1,100 houses burned down, 1,883 people killed, and 276 people arrested and missing. Twelve villages, including Yuantoushan and Ma'aotou, were completely destroyed. Due to the long-term ravages of the bandits, the population of 232 villages, including Shangxiajin and Xinan in Yongding County, decreased by one-third compared to the land revolution period, and the number of houses and draught animals decreased by more than half. A large amount of cultivated land was abandoned. However, the people in the revolutionary base areas, regardless of the bloody devastation of the reactionaries, still persisted in a long-term guerrilla war with firm confidence and indomitable will, and repeatedly struggled arduously until victory under the leadership of the Communist Party.

After liberation, the Longyan and Yongding County Party Committees of the Chinese Communist Party and the county people's governments, in order to comfort the revolutionary masses and the families of fallen martyrs, prepared to assist the masses in the past revolutionary base areas to restore production and rebuild their homes. They successively convened meetings of representatives of revolutionary base villages in mid-June. The secretary of the Longyan Prefectural Party Committee, the deputy commissioner of the Longyan Administrative Office, and the deputy commander of the military sub-district all personally attended the meetings to express their condolences to the representatives. The representatives attending the meeting were extremely excited about the care and concern shown by the Party and the government. They denounced the crimes of the Kuomintang bandits over the past twenty years. At the same time, the representatives, with a sense of ownership, cordially criticized the shortcomings in the work of the local government and put forward positive suggestions for future work. Regarding the question of how to restore production and rebuild their homes in the future, the representatives, during the discussion, all understood the current difficulties of the national financial economy and the importance of the province's task of supporting the war to liberate Taiwan. They proposed not to rely solely on government relief, but to work hard to reclaim wasteland and engage in various sideline productions. They also agreed to use the method of "large villages helping small villages" to help solve the difficulty of small villages lacking labor, in order to carry out the work of rebuilding their homes. The people's government also allocated 410,000 catties of grain to help the masses in the past revolutionary base villages in Yongding, Longyan, and Shanghang counties to overcome the difficulties of lacking production funds in the work of surviving the famine and restoring and rebuilding. At present, the Longyan Administrative Office and the people's governments of Yongding, Longyan, and other counties have sent cadres to conduct investigations and distribute grain in various villages. The people of all revolutionary base villages have expressed that they will continue to maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of the past, assist the people's government to overcome all difficulties, and build new rural areas.

　　福建龙岩、永定等县
    抚慰革命群众与烈士家属协助革命基点村重建家园
    【本报讯】福建省龙岩、永定两县人民政府，抚慰多年来坚持与国民党反动统治作斗争的革命群众和死难烈士家属，协助土地革命以来的革命基点村人民恢复生产，重建家园。龙岩专区各县土地革命时期的革命根据地，自一九二九年闽西人民在中共领导下武装起义后，二十多年来备受国民党反动派“反复清剿”、“移民并村”、烧杀劫掠的血腥摧残。据不完全统计，龙岩全县被摧残户数达三千一百零六户，被焚房屋七百零九座又二千一百九十三间，被强迫迁居的共一千四百户，被活埋、枪毙或死于狱中的达五百八十余人。其中万安区被摧残户约占全区人口的一半。永定县（缺峰市区材料）被害情形更严重，被焚毁房屋共一千一百多座，被杀害人数共一千八百八十三人，被捕失踪的达二百七十六人。该县园头山、马坳头等十二村被完全毁灭。由于匪帮的长期蹂躏，永定县上下金、溪南等二百三十二个村，人口比土地革命时期减少了三分之一，房屋、耕畜减少了一半以上。耕地大量荒芜。但革命根据地人民不顾反动派的血腥摧残，仍以坚定信心和不屈意志，在共产党领导下，坚持了长期的游击战争，反复地艰苦搏斗，一直到胜利。
    解放以后，中共龙岩、永定两县县委和县人民政府，为了抚慰革命群众和死难烈士家属，准备协助过去革命根据地群众恢复生产，重建家园，先后在今年六月中旬和下旬召开了革命基点村群众代表会议。中共龙岩地委书记、龙岩专署副专员和军分区副司令员等均亲到会场向代表们致慰。到会代表对党和政府的关怀极为兴奋；对二十多年来国民党匪帮的罪行纷纷提出了控诉。同时，代表们以主人翁的关怀态度，亲切地批评了地方政府工作中的缺点，对今后工作提出了积极的建议。对于今后如何恢复生产，重建家园问题，代表们在讨论时都体谅当前国家财政经济的困难与全省支援解放台湾战争任务的重大，提出不要单靠政府救济，自己要努力开荒和从事各种副业生产，并同意以“大村帮小村”的办法，协助解决小村庄缺乏劳动力的困难，以进行重建家园工作。人民政府亦拨发四十一万斤粮食，以帮助永定、龙岩、上杭三县过去革命基点村群众在生产度荒和恢复重建工作中克服缺乏生产资金的困难。现龙岩专署和永定、龙岩等县人民政府，都派出了干部，深入各村进行调查与发放粮食工作。各革命基点村人民纷纷表示，要继续保持和发扬过去革命的光荣传统，协助人民政府克服一切困难，建设新农村。
