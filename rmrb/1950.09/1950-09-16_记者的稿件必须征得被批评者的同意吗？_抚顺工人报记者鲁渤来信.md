Must a Reporter's Manuscript Obtain the Consent of the Criticized?
　　A Letter from Lu Bo, Reporter for Fushun Worker's Daily

To the Editor:

　　In July, I wrote a piece entitled "Where Lies the Reason for the Many Accidents and Low Quality in the Machine Repair Factory?" I took it to the Machine Repair Factory Director for review three times. Each time, he used being busy as an excuse to delay looking at it. Later, I wrote a letter enclosing the manuscript, asking him to provide his opinions within three days and return it to the newspaper. I received no reply. On July 5th, I went to the factory again to solicit opinions. Director Wang Yang expressed his disagreement with my criticism of the factory's work. His reasoning was: the factory was newly established, the mechanical equipment was poor, and the technical level was very low, hence the failure to complete production tasks; if there was to be criticism, it should be directed at the Mining Bureau and the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department. During the conversation, there was no spirit of criticism and self-criticism. I immediately told him my personal opinions. Director Wang Yang expressed dissatisfaction and said he would take his opinions to the Municipal Party Committee. This was on July 26th. After returning to the newspaper, I submitted the manuscript to the newspaper's president and editor-in-chief, who then forwarded it to the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee. They decided not to publish the manuscript.

　　The matter unfolded like this. I still request that the manuscript be published in the newspaper. If the facts are inaccurate, I will take personal responsibility. If the criticism of the Machine Repair Factory's work is wrong, I am willing to accept the punishment I deserve. The original manuscript is attached for your handling.

　　The Fushun Municipal Party Committee has also not provided strong support for carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the newspaper. When I submitted manuscripts to the responsible comrades for review, they withheld them; when I raised opinions with the Municipal Party Committee, they adopted an attitude of ignoring them. In early June, when the Machine Repair Factory Director Wang Yang reviewed a manuscript written by a reporter, he publicly flew into a rage at the reporter. Afterwards, I wrote a letter to the Municipal Party Committee, telling them about this matter, but the Municipal Party Committee did not investigate. When the correspondents saw this, they simply did not dare to write. When we organized correspondents to write, the correspondents said: "Even the reporter got his nose bloodied, what can we do!"

　　In order to quickly resolve this issue, I hope you will publish my letter in the newspaper. This will be beneficial to carrying out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications. This is my earnest hope.

　　Lu Bo, Fushun Worker's Daily

### 记者的稿件必须征得被批评者的同意吗？  抚顺工人报记者鲁渤来信

　　记者的稿件必须征得被批评者的同意吗？
    抚顺工人报记者  鲁渤来信编辑同志：
    七月份我写了《机修厂事故多质量低的原因在那里》一篇稿子，曾三次拿给机修厂厂长审阅。他都以工作忙为词，拖延不看。后来，我又写信将稿子附去，请他在三日内提出意见后寄还报社。也没得到答复。七月五日，我又去该厂征求意见，厂长汪洋同志提出不同意我批评他厂工作。理由是：厂子是新成立的，机械设备不好，技术水平很低，故完成不了生产任务；要批评，得批评矿务局、东北人民政府工业部。谈话中毫无批评与自我批评的精神。当时我即将我个人意见告诉了他，汪厂长又表示不满，说要到市委去提意见。这是七月二十六日的事。我回报社后即将稿件交本报社长、总编辑，转送市委宣传部。他们决定不发表该稿。
    事情经过是这样。我仍要求将该稿在报上发表出来。事实如有不符，概由我个人负责。如对机修厂工作批评错了，愿受应得的处分。原稿附上，请你们处理。
    抚顺市委对在报纸上开展批评与自我批评，也没给予有力支持。我写了稿子交负责同志审查时，他们把稿扣下；向市委提出意见时，他们又采取不理的态度。机修厂厂长汪洋在六月初审查记者写的一篇稿子时，曾当众向记者大发雷霆。事后我写了一封信给市委，把这件事情告诉了他们，可是市委也没追究。通讯员见此情况，根本就不敢写稿。当我们组织通讯员写稿时，通讯员说：“连记者都碰了鼻子，我们顶啥！”
    为了迅速地解决这个问题，希望你把我的信在报纸上发表，这对于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评是有好处的。这是我的恳切希望。
