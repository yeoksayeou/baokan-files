A Visit to Old Revolutionary Base Areas in Rural Shanxi

In the old liberated areas of Shanxi, land in the hands of the peasants is exerting its unprecedented power.

No matter which village you go to, you can find many vivid examples: Zhangba Village in Zuoquan County (formerly Liaoxian County) is a barren mountain area with "thick stone and thin soil." Before the War of Resistance Against Japan (hereinafter referred to as pre-war), the village's cultivated land could only produce 300 to 400 *shi* of coarse grains, but last year it produced 800 *shi*. Shi Cunjin, a labor hero in Huojiayao Village, Licheng County, has 4.4 *mu* of land, which used to belong to the landlord. At best, each *mu* could yield seven or eight *dou* of grain, but last year Shi Cunjin harvested sixteen *shi* of grain. In the southeast of Wulihou Village, Lucheng County, there is a ten-*mu* plot of cultivated land. When it was occupied by the landlord Wang Chenglie, the annual yield per *mu* was 165 *jin*; during the Japanese occupation, it dropped to 105 *jin*; and the highest pre-war yield was only 225 *jin*. After this land was distributed to poor peasant Wang Kongze during the land reform, the yield increased year by year, reaching the pre-war level in 1948, and reaching 300 *jin* per *mu* in 1949. … Many more examples like this could be cited. According to Wang Kongze, when the ten-*mu* plot of land in the southeast of Wulihou Village was first distributed to him, the weeds were tall enough to bury a person. It all depended on his intensive cultivation, adding fertilizer, plowing, hoeing, and harrowing three times each, and increasing fertilization from 30 *dan* in the past to 80 *dan*. He also used mercury agents to treat the seeds when planting, so that the wasteland could be revived. Wang Kongze stroked the "Golden Queen" corn (corn is *yumi*. "Golden Queen" corn was a high-yield corn variety promoted by the people's government during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and was extremely popular among farmers. This kind of corn has been widely planted in the rural areas of southeastern Shanxi and southwestern Hebei) he planted and said: "If there are no unexpected disasters, I guarantee that each *mu* will yield 375 *jin* of it (Golden Queen corn) this year, exceeding the highest pre-war yield by 150 *jin*!"

From the Fen River plains to the mountains of southeastern Shanxi, whether it is the vast fields or the terraced fields, the crops are growing exceptionally lush. Now the sorghum is turning red and the ears of grain are drooping. On the liberated land, these crops are simply growing rampantly.

What about the liberated farm families there?

In Zhangba Village, Zuoquan County, in the past, nine out of ten families lived on corn flour and bran. Now, they all eat corn flour, bean flour, and white flour. In Xiaguihua Village, Licheng County, before the land reform, poor farmers could only eat a few meals of white flour after the wheat harvest, and could only borrow wheat during the New Year and festivals to eat white flour. Now, most farm families in the village can eat a meal of white flour every day. The reporter once had lunch at the home of farmer Gao Yuquan in Xiaguihua Village. The meal was white noodles with stir-fried green beans and pork. This was the day before the Dragon Boat Festival. In the evening, we stayed at the home of farmer Li Qin, who brought out freshly fried oil cakes and cooked *zongzi* for everyone to eat. He said: "Who would have thought of eating these things before?"

Before the land reform, the farmers here wore old and patched clothes all year round. At best, they could wear a new coarse cloth garment; only a few landlords wore fine cloth. Now that every household has surplus grain, it is not difficult to get clothes. Farmers in Wulihou Village, Lucheng County, now take their grain to the cooperative to exchange for cloth, various fine cloths, coarse cloths, or striped cloths, whenever the summer and autumn harvests are over. This village has 960 people. In 1946, it only bought 4,200 *chi* of coarse cloth, but last year it bought 7,100 *chi* of coarse cloth and 2,910 *chi* of fine cloth.

The scars of war, the broken walls and piles of broken tiles, are no longer easy to see in these villages. Shi Changgen, a farmer in Fuche Village, Yicheng County, excitedly counted the number of houses added to his village in the past year, door to door. In one year, the whole village built 28 new tile-roofed houses, 7 thatched houses, and repaired 26 tile-roofed houses. The newly built courtyard walls looked particularly dazzling. Huojiayao Village, Licheng County, is a small village with more than 30 households, and has also built more than 40 houses from last year to this year. An old farmer named Guo in Maicang Village, Licheng County, opened four new cave dwellings this year, and chose the best elm wood for the door panels and window frames. Old Guo could not close his mouth with joy when he talked about it, and personally led us to see it. He said: "Come and see after the autumn harvest, and the whole family will move into the new cave dwellings!"

Now, these liberated farmers urgently demand to learn culture. They no longer want to be "blind illiterate."

Farmers in Zhangba Village, Zuoquan County, used the grain they harvested from collective land reclamation last year to start a primary school and send their children to school. This year, the whole village raised money again to buy wood and build a brand-new house for the school. The village also runs a cultural literacy class for young farmers. Classes are held every two days. Young people under the age of 20 can recognize and learn an average of forty or fifty characters per month. Before the land reform, the maximum number of children enrolled in Fuche Village, Yicheng County, was only 50, and the children of landlords accounted for half of them. Now, there are 113 children enrolled in the whole village, accounting for 78% of the school-age children in the whole village. The political and cultural study movement of farmers in Maicang Village, Licheng County, this year is even more in full swing. All 164 young men and women and adult farmers in the village have fully entered the people's school, and 113 old farmers, except for a few who are old and weak, have also participated in political study. Every young person in the village has a set of learning stationery, including a slate, several slate pencils, brushes, and pencils. Li Guo'er, a young woman in the village, brought her slate, slate pencils, and vocabulary book when she returned to her parents' home for only one night in March this year.

Shang Qingfa, a farmer in Maicang Village, said: "My family has been illiterate for generations. Every family knows that it is good for children to go to school, but in the past, we could not even feed ourselves, so how could we let our children go to school?" Last year, he happily sent his third son, Sanhu, to school, and also urged Dahua and Erhu to go to the people's school. Farmer Lian Guangjin was the first to sign up when the people's school opened this year; now he has recognized more than 300 characters. He said: "The landlord feudal system can be abolished, so why can't we get rid of our illiteracy? As long as we are determined, there is a way."

　　山西老区农村访问记
    山西老解放区农村，土地在农民手里正在发挥着它从来未有的力量。
    不论走到那个村庄，都可以发现不少这样的生动事例：左权县（原辽县）丈八村是“石厚土薄”的贫瘠的山地，抗日战争以前（以下简称战前），全村耕地只能产杂粮三百石到四百石，而去年却产了八百石。黎城县霍家窑村劳动英雄石寸金有四亩四分地，从前是地主的，每亩顶好能收七、八斗粮食，去年石寸金却收了十六石粮食。潞城县五里堠村东南有一块十亩大的耕地，在地主王承烈占有时，每亩常年产粮一百六十五斤；日寇统治时，降低到一百零五斤；战前的最高产量也不过二百二十五斤。这块地在土地改革时分给贫农王孔则后，产量年年上涨，一九四八年就达到了战前的水平，一九四九年每亩产到三百斤。……这样的例子还可举出许多许多。据王孔则说，五里堠村东南那块十亩大的地刚分给他的时候，蒿草长的埋了人。全靠他精耕细作，加工加肥，犁、锄、耙各三遍，施肥由过去三十担增加到八十担，下种时还用水银剂拌种，这样才把荒地种活了。王孔则抚摸着他种的“金皇后”玉茭（玉茭即玉蜀黍，“金皇后”玉茭，是抗日战争时期人民政府推广的一种产量高的玉蜀黍，极为农民欢迎。这种玉蜀黍，在晋东南和冀西南农村中已普遍种植）说：“如果没有想不到的灾，今年保证每亩收它（金皇后玉茭）三百七十五斤，超过战前最高产量一百五十斤！”
    从汾河平川到晋东南山地，无论是广阔的田野或层层的梯田，庄稼都长得分外繁茂。现在高粱初红，谷穗低垂。在解放了的土地上，这些庄稼（农作物）简直是在放肆地生长。
    那里的解放了的农家呢？
    左权县丈八村，过去十家当中就有九家靠吃谷面和糠皮过日子。现在，他们都吃的是玉茭面、豆面和白面。黎城县下桂花村，在土地改革以前，贫苦农民只能在麦收后吃几顿白面，过年过节的时候，借到麦子才能吃白面。现在全村多数农家，每天都能吃到一顿白面了。记者曾经在下桂花村农民高雨宽家吃过午饭，这顿饭是白面条，猪肉炒豆角。这是端阳节的前一天，晚上我们住在农民李琴家里，他端出刚刚炸好的油糕和煮熟的粽子要大家吃。他说：“以前谁还能想到吃上这些东西？”
    土地改革以前，这里的农民常年是穿旧补烂，顶好能穿一件新的粗布衣，穿细布的只是少数地主。现在家家有了剩余粮食，穿衣不困难了。潞城县五里堠村农民，现在每当夏秋收割完毕，就拿着粮食到合作社换布，换各种细布、粗布或者花条布。这个村九百六十口人，一九四六年只买进粗布四千二百尺，去年就买进了粗布七千一百尺，细布二千九百一十尺。
    战争的创伤，断壁残垣和破瓦片堆，在这些村庄里已不容易看到了。翼城县符册村农民石长根，兴奋得搬着指头挨门逐户地计算他村一年来增加的房屋。全村一年间新盖了瓦房二十八间，草房七间，补修瓦房二十六间。一堵堵新砌的院墙，看起来格外耀眼。黎城县霍家窑是三十多户的小村庄，去年到今年也盖了四十多间房子。该县麦仓村一户姓郭的老农民，今年新开了四孔窑洞，门板窗架都挑选了最好的榆木做的。郭老汉谈起来就高兴得合不住嘴，亲自领着我们去看了一趟。他说：“秋后你来瞧吧，全家就搬到新窑洞住啦！”
    现在，这些翻了身的农民迫切要求学习文化，他们再也不愿当“睁眼瞎子”了。
    左权县丈八村的农民，去年用集体开荒打下的粮食，开办了一所小学，把自己的孩子送去念书。今年，全村又集资买了木料，给学校盖了一座崭新的房子。该村还给青年农民办了一个文化补习班。两天上一次课，二十岁以下的青年，每月平均能认会四、五十个字。土地改革以前，翼城县符册村入学儿童最多只有五十人，地主的子弟占一半。现在，全村有一百一十三个儿童入学，占全村学龄儿童的百分之七十八。黎城县麦仓村农民今年的政治、文化学习运动，更是热火朝天。全村一百六十四个男女青年、壮年农民完全进了民校，一百十三个老农，除个别年老体衰的以外，也都参加了政治学习。村里每一个青年都有一套学习文具，包括一张石板，几枝石笔、毛笔和铅笔。该村青年妇女李果儿，今年三月回娘家只住一夜，也带着她的石板、石笔和生字本子。
    麦仓村农民尚清发说：“我家辈辈都是睁眼瞎子。谁家也懂得儿女上学好，过去嘴都顾不住，怎能让娃娃念书呢？”去年，他高高兴兴地把他的三儿子三虎送进了学校，并且还督促着大虎、二虎也上了民校。农民连广金在今年开办民校的时候就首先报了名；现在已经认识三百多字了。他说：“地主封建制度都能取消，为啥咱的文盲帽子脱不掉？只要下决心，就有办法。”
