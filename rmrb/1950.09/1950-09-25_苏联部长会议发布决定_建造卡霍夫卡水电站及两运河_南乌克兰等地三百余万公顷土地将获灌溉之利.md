Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 21st (TASS): The USSR Council of Ministers has issued a decision regarding the construction of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station on the Dnieper River, the South Ukrainian Canal, the North Crimean Canal, and the diversion of water to irrigate arid lands in southern Ukraine and northern Crimea.

The decision points out that the construction of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station, the Ukrainian and Crimean canals, and other measures will supply the region's industry and agriculture with the necessary electricity and water resources, ensure bumper harvests of crops (mainly cotton and wheat), and further develop animal husbandry.

The decision states: The Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station will be completed between 1951 and 1956. The hydroelectric power station will have a fixed generating capacity of 250,000 kilowatts, and the power generation in a normal water level year will be 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours. A lock, a navigable water gate, a large reservoir with a storage capacity of 14 billion cubic meters, and several pumping stations will also be built there.

The decision continues: From 1951 to 1957, the South Ukrainian Canal and the North Crimean Canal, which are connected to each other, will be constructed, extending 550 kilometers from Zaporozhye to Kerch. The South Ukrainian Canal will divert a total water volume of 600 to 640 cubic meters per second from the Dnieper River. A lock, a reservoir with a storage capacity of 6 billion cubic meters, and a hydroelectric power station with a fixed generating capacity of 10,000 kilowatts will be built next to the lock on the canal line. Several reservoirs with a total storage capacity of at least 1 billion cubic meters will be excavated along the canal line. A 60-kilometer-long canal will also be excavated to connect the South Ukrainian Canal with the Kakhovka Reservoir, so as to use gravity to divert water into the irrigation system. Many large irrigation canals with a total length of 300 kilometers will be opened in the canal area.

The decision points out that the hydroelectric power station and the canals will irrigate 1.2 million hectares of land in the Kerch, Zaporozhye, Nikolaev, and Dnepropetrovsk regions of southern Ukraine, and 300,000 hectares of land in northern Crimea. 1.7 million hectares of land in the South Ukrainian and North Crimean regions can also be irrigated with diverted water. Protective forest belts will also be planted along the edges of the irrigated areas to stabilize the shifting sand in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River.

The USSR Council of Ministers has ordered the USSR Ministry of Power Stations to carry out the design and survey work for Kakhovka, and the construction project will be the responsibility of the Dnieper River Hydroelectric Power Station Construction Bureau under the Ministry of Power Stations. The Council of Ministers charged the USSR Ministry of Cotton Growing, together with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of State Farms, with the local authorities of Ukraine and Crimea, to carry out the design, survey, irrigation and water diversion work of the two major canals and other projects, and to draft various measures to develop agriculture and animal husbandry. This year, the Ukrainian Water Conservancy Construction Bureau will be established to engage in construction work. The USSR Council of Ministers has also charged the USSR Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of State Farms, and the Central Administration of Farmland Shelterbelts directly under the Council of Ministers with the responsibility for surveying, designing, implementing, and supervising the afforestation and stabilization of shifting sand in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River.

　　苏联部长会议发布决定
    建造卡霍夫卡水电站及两运河
    南乌克兰等地三百余万公顷土地将获灌溉之利
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：苏联部长会议发布了关于建造第聂伯河畔卡霍夫卡水力发电站、南乌克兰运河、北克里米亚运河，以及引水灌溉乌克兰南部干燥地带和克里米亚北部地区土地的决定。
    决定指出：建造卡霍夫卡水电站、乌克兰及克里米亚运河及其他措施，将供应该地区工业及农业所需要的电力及水源，确保农作物（主要是棉花和小麦）获得丰收，并进一步发展牲畜业。
    决定称：卡霍夫卡水力发电站将在一九五一至一九五六年内建筑完毕。该水电站将具有二十五万千瓦的固定发电能力，在水位正常的年份发电量将为十二亿千瓦时。在该处并将建造一座水闸，一道可以通航的水门，一个能储水一百四十亿立方公尺的大蓄水池和若干唧水站。
    决定继称：一九五一至一九五七年，将建筑南乌克兰运河与北克里米亚运河，两运河互相连接，从萨坡罗什至刻赤，全长五百五十公里。南乌克兰运河每秒钟从第聂伯河导入总水量为六百到六百四十立方公尺。在运河线上特建造一座水闸，一个能储水六十亿立方公尺的蓄水池，并在水闸旁建筑一座具有一万千瓦固定发电能力的水力发电站。沿运河线将开凿储水总量至少为十亿立方公尺的若干蓄水池。并将开凿一条使南乌克兰运河与卡霍夫卡蓄水池相通的长六十公里的运河，以利用重力引水注入灌溉系统。在运河地区将开凿全长三百公里的许多大灌溉渠。
    决定指出：水电站及运河将灌溉乌克兰共和国南部的刻赤、萨坡罗什、尼古拉耶夫和第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克各州的一百二十万公顷的土地，以及克里米亚州北部的三十万公顷的土地。南乌克兰与北克里米亚地区的一百七十万公顷的土地亦可引水灌溉。并将在灌溉地区的边缘，种植防护林带，以使第聂伯河下游的流沙定着。
    苏联部长会议已命令苏联电站部进行有关卡霍夫卡的设计及勘测工作，建筑工程则由电站部所属的第聂伯河水力发电站建设处负责。部长会议责成苏联植棉部会同农业部和国家农场部与乌克兰及克里米亚当地的负责机关，进行两大运河及其他工程的设计、勘测、灌溉及引水的工作，并草拟各项措施以发展农业及牲畜业。今年将成立乌克兰水利建设处，从事建筑工作。苏联部长会议并已责成苏联林业部、国家农场部与部长会议直属的农田防护林中央管理委员会，负责勘测、设计、执行和监督第聂伯河下游造林与固定流沙的工作。
