    On the Eve of National Day, a Letter to Chairman Mao Thanking Him
　　All the People of Yushe Labor Hero Zhang Zhiquan's Village
    Report Achievements in the Three Autumn Campaigns
    This year, the entire village organized 55 experienced veteran farmers to cultivate the land and sow wheat, and over 120 women selected seeds, laying the foundation for increased production next year.
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Shanxi Province delegate to the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Model Workers, and Soldier Representatives, Zhang Zhiquan, the labor hero from Yushe County, comes from Dazhai Village. Due to organization, improved technology, and the carrying out of the Great Production Movement, the village had a bumper wheat harvest this year, and the Three Autumn Campaigns (autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing) have also achieved good results. On September 13th, the village government and the CCP branch led all the men and women of the 33 mutual aid teams in the village in writing a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on the production situation. The original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:
    We are now reporting to you on the production situation in our village.
    On the basis of organizing, improving technology, and increasing production last year, our village launched a Great Production Movement this year. Under your wise leadership and the direct and specific help and guidance of the local Party and government, we have found various ways to increase production. This spring, we organized a Seedling Protection Committee to fight against various disasters and ensure that the entire village's 856 mu of wheat was harvested and stored. This year's wheat harvest was 152 dan more than last year's. This bumper harvest has made us realize even more deeply that only by listening to you, organizing, improving technology, deep plowing and careful cultivation, and applying more fertilizer can we grow more grain and live a good life.
    The entire administrative village is sowing 590 mu of wheat this year. In order to achieve deep plowing and careful cultivation, we plowed the land in advance and specially organized 55 experienced veteran farmers to hold the plow, ensuring that the wheat land was well cultivated. Of the village's wheat land, 120 mu was plowed five times, and 470 mu was plowed four times. An average of 85 dan of fertilizer was applied per mu, which is 10 dan more than last year. While plowing, we also improved 250 mu of soil. 98 percent of the wheat seeds sown were treated with warm soaking and medicine mixing, and 324 mu of land was planted with improved wheat varieties. Our labor hero, Zhang Zhiquan, also specially opened up a 0.5 mu "small farm" to try out nine varieties of wheat to research and discover improved varieties suitable for local growth. The wheat has now emerged evenly from the soil and is growing very luxuriantly, laying the foundation for a bumper wheat harvest next year.
    At the beginning of the Three Autumn Campaigns, 65 heroes and technical experts from the entire administrative village were organized to observe and discuss. Examples were given of the contrast between the good and bad growth of crops from seeds selected last year and planted with improved varieties this year, and crops from those who did not select seeds or believe in improved varieties, in order to inspire and promote autumn seed selection. Because everyone recognized the principle that "selecting good seeds this year guarantees a grain harvest next year," a seed selection committee was organized. Under the guidance of Zhang Zhiquan and 33 other seed selection experts, 123 women from the village were mobilized to participate in the seed selection work. Under the leadership of An Aixian and Pei Fengying, the women selected a total of 25 shi and 9 dou of various small field crop seeds (cowpeas, small beans, etc.), 6 shi and 5 dou of hemp seeds, and 1 shi and 4 dou of mustard seeds in 15 days. All seeds were also selected, cut, threshed, and stored separately. At the same time, 12,300 jin of yams (potatoes) and 2,240 gourds and pumpkins were selected. Sorghum and corn were marked with tags and tied with hemp rope, and a total of 15,000 ears of corn and 23,000 ears of sorghum were selected. Our seed selection slogan is "Rather have surplus than lack." In addition to having enough for our own use, we are also prepared to have other villages come to exchange seeds. We have now also designated grain and bean seed selection areas, selecting 356 mu of disease-free and excellent grain varieties and 321 mu of various beans for fine selection of ears and panicles during harvesting.
    In order to protect the seedlings and ensure that various autumn crops are fully harvested, we established a frost prevention committee before autumn. Based on past experience, we selected locations that are often subject to frost damage and established 29 frost prevention stations, each stocked with 1,500 jin of firewood. To complete the task of gathering firewood, all the men and women of the village turned out together and cut 45,000 jin of Artemisia grass in three days. Each frost prevention station is also staffed with three people to specially observe the weather and light fires in a timely manner. The benefit of this method is that it can prevent both frost and freezing; if no frost occurs, the Artemisia grass can be used to fertilize the land in the fall, achieving three benefits in one fell swoop.
    We also studied this year's climate, recognized that high rainfall and wet ground may lead to early frost, so we selected 75 experienced plowmen to specialize in plowing, harvesting one piece and plowing another. The entire village, combined with the autumn harvest and wheat sowing, has already plowed 257 mu of small field stubble land.
    We were able to achieve these results mainly because we organized ourselves during the Three Autumn Campaigns, divided the work according to tasks, fully mobilized women, organized production competitions, and launched a 60-day comparison movement during the Three Autumn Campaigns: comparing leadership, organization, technology, harvest, and learning from local experiences. We are using such active production to respond to your call for increased production, to welcome the county, provincial, and central model worker representative conferences, and to strive to become heroes! This is what we want to report to you. We wish you and the central leaders good health.
          Respectfully, all the men and women of Dazhai Administrative Village, Yushe County, Shanxi Province

    国庆前夕上书感谢毛主席
　　榆社劳动英雄张志全所在村全体群众
    报告三秋工作成绩
    今年全村组织了五十五名技术老农耕地种麦，一百二十余名妇女选种打下明年增产基础。
    【本报讯】出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的山西省代表，榆社县劳动英雄张志全所在村——大寨村，由于组织起来，改良技术，开展大生产运动，今年麦子丰收，三秋（秋收、秋耕、秋种）工作也已作出良好的成绩。该村村政府和中共支部，于九月十三日，带领全村三十三个互助组的全体男女群众，写信给毛主席，报告生产情况。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    现在我们将我村的生产情况向您报告一下。
    俺村在去年组织起来、改良技术、提高生产的基础上，今年又开展了大生产运动。在您的英明领导和当地党与政府直接具体的帮助指导下，找出了各种增产的门路。今春，我们组织了保苗委员会，与各种灾害展开斗争，保住了全村八百五十六亩麦子丰收入仓。今年的麦子共比去年多打了一百五十二石。这个丰收，使我们更深刻地知道：只有听您话，组织起来，改良技术，深耕细作，多施肥料，才能多打粮食，过好光景。
    全行政村今年种麦五百九十亩，为了作到深耕细作，就提前插犁耕地，并专门组织了五十五个技术老农掌犁，使麦地耕的好。全村的麦地，有一百二十亩耕了五次，四百七十亩耕了四次。每亩地平均施肥八十五担，比去年多施了十担。在与耕地同时，还改良土壤二百五十亩。所种的麦种有百分之九十八经过了温浸和药拌，而且有三百二十四亩地是种的优良麦种。我们劳动英雄张志全还特地开辟了一块五分地的“小农场”，试种了九样品种的小麦，来研究发现适合本地生长的优良品种。现麦子已出土齐垅，非常繁茂，给明年小麦丰收打下了基础。
    三秋运动开始时，组织了全行政村的英雄、技术能手六十五人观摩座谈，拿去年选了种、今年种优良品种的庄稼和不选种、不相信优种的人的庄稼生长好坏的实例对比，来启发推动秋季选种。由于大家都认识了“今年选好种，明年收粮有保证”的道理，组织了选种委员会，在张志全等三十三个选种技术能手指导下，发动了全村一百二十三个妇女参加选种工作。妇女们在安爱仙和裴凤英领导下，十五天时间，共选下各种小田作物（豇豆、小豆等）种籽二十五石九斗，大麻籽六石五斗，芥菜籽一石四斗。所有的种籽还都作到了单选、单割、单打、单放。同时并选了山药蛋（马铃薯）一万二千三百斤，南瓜、北瓜共二千二百四十个；高粱、玉茭用挂牌和麻绳捆的办法作记号，共选玉茭一万五千穗，高粱二万三千穗。我们的选种口号是“宁余勿缺”，除自己够用外，还准备外村来调换种籽。现在又划定了谷、豆选种区，划出没病害的优良品种谷三百五十六亩，各种豆三百二十一亩，以便收割时从中精选与穗选。
    为了保护禾苗，使各种大秋作物收得饱满，我们在秋前成立了防霜委员会，根据历年来的经验，选择常遭霜害的地点，建立了二十九个防霜台，每台准备柴草一千五百斤。为完成打柴任务，全村男女一齐出动，三天共割蒿草四万五千斤。每个防霜台并设三个人专门观察天象与及时点火。这种办法的好处是既能防霜，又能防冻；如果没有霜冻发生，秋后就将蒿草熏粪上地，一举三得。
    我们又研究了今年的气候，认识了雨多、地湿，可能早上冻的情况，于是及早选出七十五个耕地技术能手，专门掌犁，收割一块耕一块。全村结合秋收种麦，已耕出小田茬地二百五十七亩。
    能够作出这些成绩，主要是由于在三秋中组织起来，按活分工，充分发动妇女，组织生产竞赛，展开了三秋期间六十天的评比运动：比领导、比组织起来、比技术、比收成、比学习各地经验等的结果。我们就是用这样的积极生产来回答您的增产号召，迎接县、省、中央的劳模代表大会，争取当英雄！这就是我们所要向您报告的事情。祝您和中央各首长健康。
          山西省榆社县大寨行政村全体男女群众敬上
                一九五○年九月十三日
