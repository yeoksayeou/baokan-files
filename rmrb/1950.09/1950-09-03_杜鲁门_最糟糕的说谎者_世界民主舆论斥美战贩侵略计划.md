Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 2nd. World democratic opinion unanimously denounces the US imperialists' plans to launch aggressive war, recently announced publicly by warmongers MacArthur and Matthews, pointing out that Truman's hasty denial is merely a hypocritical and clumsy cover-up, and calls on peace-loving people around the world to fight to defeat the warmongers' reckless adventures.

The journal "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" published on the first of this month carried a special article by Malek stating: "MacArthur exposed Truman, who has repeatedly stated that the United States is 'defending' Taiwan for 'justice' and 'peace', as the worst liar." The author said: "People cannot but agree with MacArthur that Taiwan is necessary for the American imperialists who want to establish hegemony in Southeast Asia." But Truman is most reluctant to make such an admission. He has asked MacArthur to speak less more than once. This time, Truman had to publicly 'refute' MacArthur and even 'demand' that the latter withdraw his statement." The author concluded: "MacArthur's letter is an open call for a more cruel and bloody suppression of the national liberation movement of the Eastern people. However, the Eastern people are drawing their conclusions from this matter."

The Romanian Workers' Party's organ, Spark, called MacArthur and Matthews "fascist loudmouths" who leaked the US aggression plans, and who have "exposed their despicable desire to enslave all nations before the whole world." Spark pointed out: "MacArthur and Matthews' crazy remarks are not a sign of strength, but a manifestation of panic among the war-mongering clique. Because they have begun to feel the fragility of the building in the decline of imperialism, and the increasing power of the forces of peace." Spark continued: The public disclosure of such an aggression plan has disrupted the politicians' "diplomatic calculations." Truman's attempt to reduce the influence of these two man-eating savages is futile. What they said has been firmly imprinted in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people, and they have heard the violent roar of the madman Hitler from these words." Spark finally called on the Romanian people to intensify their efforts to defend peace and give the belligerent fascists a proper response.

The Danish Communist Party's organ, "Land and People," pointed out that although Truman "refuted" the US Secretary of the Navy's public declaration that the United States should immediately launch a "preemptive" war and MacArthur's statement that his purpose was to use Taiwan, the territory of China recognized by the Danish government, as an aircraft carrier in the war against the Asian people, everyone knows that these forces are playing a decisive role. "Land and People" demanded that Denmark must withdraw from the North Atlantic war bloc, "The Danish people must not allow crazy war provocateurs such as MacArthur and Matthews to decide their fate."

　　杜鲁门—最糟糕的说谎者
    世界民主舆论斥美战贩侵略计划
    【新华社布拉格二日电】世界民主舆论一致痛斥为战争贩子麦克阿瑟与马休斯最近所公开宣布的美国帝国主义准备发动侵略战争的计划，指出杜鲁门的慌忙否认，只是假惺惺的拙劣掩饰，并号召世界爱好和平人民为击败战争贩子的狂妄冒险而斗争。
    本月一日出版的《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》发表马莱克的专论称：“麦克阿瑟暴露了那个一再申明美国为了‘正义’与‘和平’而‘保卫’台湾的杜鲁门，是一个最糟糕的说谎者。”作者说：“人们不得不同意麦克阿瑟，台湾对于为了要在东南亚建立霸权的美国帝国主义者来说是必要的。”但是杜鲁门却最忌讳作这样的招认。他已经不止一次地请求麦克阿瑟少说话。这一次，杜鲁门不得不公开‘驳斥’麦克阿瑟，甚至‘要求’后者撤回他的声明。”作者最后指出：“麦克阿瑟的信是一个公开的号召，要求更残酷和血腥地镇压东方人民的民族解放运动。可是东方人民正从这件事情当中得到他们的结论。”
    罗马尼亚工人党机关报火花报，把麦克阿瑟和马休斯称为泄露了美国侵略计划的“法西斯话匣子”，他们已“在全世界面前暴露了奴役一切民族的卑鄙欲望”。火花报指出：“麦克阿瑟与马休斯的疯狂言论，不是力量的表现，而是战争贩子集团惊慌失措的表现。因为它们已开始感到帝国主义颓败中的大厦的脆弱，以及和平力量日益壮大的威力。”火花报接着说：这样把侵略计划公开，已把政客们的“外交算盘”打乱了。杜鲁门企图减少这两个吃人生番的影响是徒劳无益的。他们所讲的话已牢固地印在亿万人民心中，他们从这些话里听出了疯人希特勒狂暴的咆哮。火花报最后号召罗马尼亚人民加紧为保卫和平而努力，予好战的法西斯分子以应有的回答。
    丹麦共产党机关报《国土与人民》报指出：杜鲁门虽然“驳斥”了美国海军部长公开宣称美国应立即“先发制人”发动战争和麦克阿瑟宣布他的目的是将丹麦政府已承认了的中国的领土台湾作为反对亚洲人民战争中的航空母舰的声明，然而人人知道正是这些力量在起决定作用。《国土与人民》报要求丹麦必须脱离北大西洋战争集团，“丹麦人民决不能让疯狂的战争挑拨者如麦克阿瑟与马休斯之流来决定他们的命运”。
