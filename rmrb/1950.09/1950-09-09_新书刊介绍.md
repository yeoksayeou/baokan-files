This work is a record of the victory and consolidation of socialism in the countryside and is a sequel to the author's other famous work, *Cavalier of the Gold Star*. In this novel, the author narrates the advanced farmers in socialist collective farms and their great achievements in agriculture and mechanization.

Foster's Letter to Soviet Writers and Soviet Writers' Reply*; and Nikolaev's *On Henri Barbusse*, etc. There is also a short article introducing the *Soviet Union* Pictorial, which is also very valuable.
