　　Mao Zedong Locomotive
    Ding Kexin and Qing Ying
    (Serialized novella)
            Fifteen, "It's a Real Disaster if the Old Ways Don't Change!"
    Task after task, rushing to overhaul, and once the overhaul was complete, it was back out on the line.
    Harbin to Yimianpo, run, run! Yimianpo to Harbin, run, run!
    Zheng Dugong was really starting to feel like he couldn't keep up. The old hero had told him to go home and see his wife a few days ago, but he stubbornly refused. Now, the more he thought about his wife, the more troubled he became. He really wanted to ask for leave to go back and rest for a few days, but the words got stuck in his throat when he saw the old hero's mangled mouth and crooked arm. He felt even angrier, thinking:
    "Even with injuries like that, he still works, truly sacrificing himself without a thought for wealth, dragging others to their deaths with him..."
    One morning, it was their turn to rest. Sunlight streamed through the glass windows into the bunk car. Sun Changxin and the old hero were gathered around the stove, warming themselves. Zheng Dugong lay on his back, speaking in a tentative tone:
    "I heard that Lin Kou is implementing a large shift system again (Note 1)."
    "What, do you want a large shift system to make things easier?" Sun Changxin said, without even looking up.
    "Hey, who doesn't want to be more comfortable?"
    "Comfortable?" Sun Changxin stopped warming himself and stood up: "Haven't you seen the newspaper?"
    "What newspaper?"
    "It was in the newspaper: the large shifts in Lin Kou have resulted in trains not running at all!"
    "Not running?" The Holy Man couldn't lie still and sat up.
    "They rely on punishment instead of responsibility, and no one is motivated. Today they drive this train, tomorrow they drive that train. Who is going to be responsible for protecting it? Parts are constantly being lost from the train. The seat box (Note 2) has been repaired three times and lost three times, and no one cares."
    He looked at the Holy Man and added:
    "You've been around the block yourself. It's a real disaster if the old ways don't change: the driver just drives, the stoker just stokes. After a lifetime of work, they still don't know anything about the inside and outside, the top and bottom of the locomotive. They can't even repair it, let alone know where the problem is. Lin Kou is a real mess... If the air pump (Note 3) breaks, no one cares! If the connecting rod gets hot, no one cares! If there's a malfunction in the cylinder, no one cares!... In short, the locomotives are all falling apart, unable to run, so what's the point of driving them?"
    The old hero hadn't said a word, he listened quietly to Sun Changxin. Then, he said:
    "They won't give up until they're at death's door. Lin Kou will definitely implement the responsibility system again!"
    The Old Holy Man had already lain back down. Hearing the old hero's last two sentences, he rolled over and stared blankly at the sun outside the window.
    Note 1: The Japanese, puppet Manchu, British and American capitalist countries used the locomotive to exploit workers. The new contract responsibility system means that people control the train and people are the masters of the locomotive.
    Note 2: The seat in the driver's cabin.
    Note 3: A pump that forces air used for braking, also called an air compressor.
            Sixteen, Second Award
    And so, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" adhered to the responsibility system and continued to run to Yimianpo.
    The weather was so cold, the tasks were so heavy, the slopes were so difficult, and the shifts were so tight (the two shifts rotated one after the other) that they could often only cook a few cold buns and heat up a few bowls of sorghum porridge. They ate quickly, wiped their mouths, and sped off into the heavy wind and snow.
    Late at night, their eyes were blurry and couldn't stay open, their bodies were limp like mud, and their heads were swollen like drums.
    Zheng Dugong sometimes really felt like losing his temper, but when he saw Sun Changxin silently and steadily shoveling coal, he was too embarrassed to even fart.
    The next day, returning to Harbin at dawn, the two looked at each other. Their faces were blackened by coal smoke, making Zheng Dugong feel a mix of laughter and tears.
    But the old hero rang the copper warning bell:
    "Ding! Ding! Ding!..." The train was entering the station.
    When people heard this bell, they all knew and would say:
    "The Mao Zedong Locomotive is back!"
    Zheng Dugong would also get excited, perk up, and persevere.
    And so, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" adhered to the responsibility system, continued to run to Yimianpo, and persevered through the winter.
    Everyone said: "The Mao Zedong Locomotive is truly outstanding!"
    Everyone praised: "The locomotive leader, living up to its name!"
    People also respected the old hero and Shang Baoheng even more. Often, as soon as people saw Old Shang, they would say:
    "Chief Shang, you really have what it takes!"
    "Chief Shang, you're sure to win a second award!"
    Old Shang was happy, but he also thought: "If we win an award this time, it will be entirely because of our hard work. If I say there's no problem, then I guarantee there's no problem!..."
    Sure enough, at the second commendation meeting, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" was once again awarded a collective first-class merit and received a second award banner:
    "Well Maintained, Safe Operation."
    The section chief, the new representative Zhang, the operations director, and others constantly visited the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" and even personally helped them clean the train. When giving speeches, they often praised the achievements of their responsibility system, commended the old hero Li Yong for his leadership, and encouraged everyone to learn from them.

　　毛泽东号
    丁克辛轻影作
    （中篇连载）
            十五、“老一套不改真够呛！”
    任务接着任务，抢着检修，检修完毕就出库。
    哈尔滨到一面坡，跑，跑！一面坡到哈尔滨，跑，跑！
    郑笃恭真有点坚持不住了，前些天老英雄让他回家去看看，他又拧着劲不回去，这两日一想起老婆，心里就更麻烦。很想请假回去歇几天，可是话到嘴边上，一看老英雄的烂嘴歪胳膊，就又咽了回去；心里却更有火，他想：
    “摔成那样子还干，真他娘舍命不舍财，把别人也拉扯着死干。……”
    一天上午，轮到他们歇班。阳光透过玻璃窗射到宿营车上，孙长信和老英雄围着炉子烤火。郑笃恭朝天躺着，用试探的口气说道：
    “听说林口又实行大轮班（注一）了。”
    “怎么，你想大轮班轻闲轻闲吗？”孙长信说，头也没抬。
    “嗨，说的，谁不想自在些？”
    “自在？”孙长信不烤火了，站起来：“你没有看见报？”
    “什么报？”
    “报上登啦：林口大轮班轮得车都不开了！”
    “不开车了？”圣人躺不着啦，坐了起来。
    “他们不靠负责靠处罚，谁的劲头也不高。今天开这台车，明天开那台车，谁还负责保护它？车上零件不断的丢，坐厢（注二）修上三回丢了三回，谁也不管。”
    他看一看圣人，又说：
    “你也是过来人，那老一套不改革可真够呛：开车的就只管开车，烧火的就只管烧火，干上一辈子，对机车里里外外上上下下，还是球事不懂，别说不会修理，连毛病出在哪里也不知道。林口可就热闹啦……风泵（注三）坏了没人管！连杆发热没人管！汽筒发生故障没人管！……一句话，机车都烂啦，开不出去啦，还开什么车？”
    老英雄一直没有说话，他也静静地听着孙长信讲，这时他才说道：
    “不到黄泉心不死，林口准又该实行负责制啦！”
    老圣人早又躺倒了，他听了老英雄末二句话，翻了个身，对着玻璃外面的太阳发呆。
    注一：是日本、伪满、英美资本主义国家用机车剥削工人，人为机车支配的开车制，新的包乘负责制是人支配车，人是机车主人的开车制。
    注二：司机棚内坐的凳子。
    注三：泵出风来停车用的，也叫压缩机。
            十六、二次得奖
    就这样，“毛泽东号”坚持负责制，坚持跑一面坡。
    天气那样冷，任务那样重，坡道那样难走，班次那样紧迫（两班人一递一的轮流换），他们时常只能烧几个冷窝窝，热几碗高粱粥，抢着吃了，把嘴一抹，就向大风雪中急驶而去。
    夜深了，眼睛迷迷糊糊睁不开，浑身软绵绵地像摊泥，脑袋木胀胀地像面鼓。………
    郑笃恭有时真像发脾气，可是一看孙长信不声不响的，一锹连一锹的，认真添着煤，就连屁也不好意思放了。
    第二天天亮返回哈尔滨，两个人相对一看，脸都被煤烟熏成了黑炭团，郑笃恭又有点哭不得笑不得。
    可是老英雄把铜警钟拉响了：
    “当！当！当！……”车进站啦。
    人们一听到这个钟声，就都知道，都会说：
    “毛泽东号回来啦！”
    郑笃恭也就兴奋起来，提起精神，坚持着。
    就这样，“毛泽东号”坚持负责制，坚持跑一面坡，坚持了一冬天。
    哪个不说：“毛泽东号真棒！”
    哪个不夸：“机车领袖，名不虚传！”
    人们对老英雄和商宝恒也更加尊敬了，时常有人一见老商就说：
    “商大车，真有两下啊！”
    “商大车，二次得奖跑不了啦！”
    老商一面高兴，一面也想：“这一回要得奖，可是全凭咱卖了力气，咱要说没问题就保险没问题！……”
    果然，第二次庆功大会上，“毛泽东号”又一次被评为集体一大功，并得了第二面奖旗：
    “保修良好，走行安全。”
    段长，新来的张代表、运转主任等，不断的到“毛泽东号”来看望，还亲自下手帮他们擦车；点名讲话的时候，也常常称赞他们负责制的成绩，表扬老英雄李永领导有功，鼓励大家向他们学习。
