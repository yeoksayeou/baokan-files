　　Prevent the Vulgarization of Self-Criticism
    In the rectification movement, adhering to the promotion of democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism is the central link in deeply examining and summarizing work. However, we must also prevent the tendencies of formalism and vulgarization in criticism and self-criticism. At present, a few places have experienced this vulgarized bias: some places, during the rectification, set up "suggestion boxes" to encourage anonymous suggestions; another is the report from Jinzhou today, which states that department heads adopt the method of "avoidance" when holding symposiums to examine work. This phenomenon reflects the ideological sentiments of some backward cadres and party members; it also reflects the abnormal emotions of some backward leading cadres towards self-criticism. These methods are obviously wrong and fundamentally violate the principles of internal Party criticism and self-criticism. The Constitution of the Communist Party of China stipulates: "To criticize any worker of the Party at Party meetings." Outside the Party, the CCP Central Committee's decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals has pointed out: "In all public occasions, among the masses of the people... launch criticism and self-criticism of all errors and shortcomings in our work." Moreover, the Party's rectification instructions also stipulate "examining and summarizing work from top to bottom."
    The purpose of "anonymous letters" and "avoidance" seems to be to promote democracy and encourage criticism, which is completely unnecessary. Thousands of experiences have proven that at any time, not only during the rectification period, as long as the leading comrades can truly humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, the masses will enthusiastically and bravely put forward their opinions. In this rectification movement, many experiences have proven that as long as the leading comrades can truly first conduct a self-examination of the shortcomings and errors that do exist in their work, then the masses can boldly put forward their own opinions and criticisms focusing on the main issues raised by the responsible comrades. "Avoidance" and other methods first make our examination and criticism become mere formalities, and also lead to a state of no leadership. Such criticism will naturally drift into boundless trivial matters and will not have any results. This is not a realistic approach.
    To correctly promote democracy and carry out criticism and self-criticism, we can only rely on everyone, especially responsible comrades, to consciously, humbly, and publicly listen to the opinions of the masses. There is no other method. As for the dishonest method of avoiding criticism, it is even more unacceptable.

### 防止把自我批评庸俗化

　　防止把自我批评庸俗化
    在整风运动中，坚持发扬民主、开展批评与自我批评，是深入检查与总结工作的中心环节。但是也要防止批评与自我批评中的形式化与庸俗化的倾向。目前已有少数地方发生了这种庸俗化的偏向：有些地方，整风时，设“意见箱”，号召匿名提意见；另外就是今天锦州市整风消息中所报道的，在召开检查工作的座谈会时，部门负责同志实行“回避”的办法。这种现象，正是一部分落后干部党员的思想情绪的反映；也是一部分落后领导干部对自我批评的不正常的情绪的反映。这些方式，显然是错误的，根本违反党内批评与自我批评原则的。中国共产党党章规定：“在党的会议上批评党的任何工作人员”，在党外，中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定中已指出：“在一切公开场合，在人民群众中……展开对于我们工作中一切错误和缺点的批评和自我批评。”并且在党的整风指示中，也规定了“自上而下检查总结工作”。
    “匿名信”和“回避”的目的，似乎是为了发扬民主，鼓励批评，这是完全不必要的，千百次的经验证明，任何时候，不仅是整风期间，只要领导同志真正能够虚心倾听群众意见，群众是会热诚而勇敢地提出意见的。在这次整风运动中，许多经验证明：只要领导同志真正能够首先自我检查工作中的确存在的缺点与错误，那末群众就可以大胆地围绕着负责同志所提出的主要问题提出自己的意见与批评。“回避”等方式，首先就使我们的检查、批评流于形式，而且会陷入无领导的状态，这样的批评很自然地会流于漫无边际的琐事之中，而不会有任何结果的。这不是一种实事求是的作风。
    要想正确地发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，只有依靠每个人，特别是负责同志，自觉地虚心地公开地倾听群众意见。任何别的方法是没有的。至于不老实的躲避批评的办法更是不应该的。
