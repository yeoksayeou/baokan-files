Implementing the People's Government's Ethnic Policies
    Qinghai's Minority Ethnic Work Achieves Success

    [By Our Correspondent Qiao Qian] This newspaper's special correspondent Qiao Qian reports: Since the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, significant achievements have been made in work related to minority ethnic groups.

    Firstly, achievements in establishing political power. Qinghai Province has seven ethnic groups with complex interrelationships. The province has a total of twenty-three administrative units. In agricultural areas and areas primarily engaged in agriculture, joint ethnic political power has been established in fourteen counties, and sixty district and two hundred and sixty township governments have been reformed. Based on the situation of concentrated and mixed residence, all fraternal ethnic groups have been able to participate in district and township governments in proportion to their ethnic population. Five counties, including Huzhu, Datong, Yushu, Chengduo, and Nangqian, are currently establishing or preparing to establish county-level joint political power.

    Secondly, cultivating cadres from fraternal ethnic groups is the key to carrying out all work. Since liberation, the Qinghai Provincial People's Government has attached great importance to this task. According to preliminary statistics, there are currently two hundred and twenty-seven cadres from fraternal ethnic groups participating in government work above the township level throughout the province (mainly in agricultural areas). In terms of school education, a youth cadre training class was held last year, which was converted into a People's Public School this year, specializing in training cadres from various fraternal ethnic groups. A total of two hundred and thirty-six students from local fraternal ethnic groups have been admitted before and after, and fifty-nine have been sent out to participate in work.

    Thirdly, twenty-one ethnic disputes have been successfully resolved through equal consultation, mediation, and self-criticism. Examples include the Hui-Han ethnic dispute over the Fanghui Canal in Huzhu County and the land dispute between the Xiajun Temple and farmers in Huangzhong County. The successful resolution of these disputes has further strengthened the unity between the various ethnic groups and gradually eliminated historical ethnic divisions.

    Fourthly, after the provincial Ethnic Friendship Association was convened in January this year, thirteen counties in agricultural areas successively convened representative conferences of people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life. Some counties and cities convened two to three times, with representatives of fraternal ethnic groups accounting for more than one-third of the delegates. The meetings mainly discussed issues such as unity, public security, and production. Through this representative conference, the various policies of the People's Government were publicized, the ties between the government and the people of all ethnic groups were strengthened, the political awareness of the masses was raised, and ethnic unity was strengthened.

    Since the establishment of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, it has begun to combine ethnic policies with specific situations in the seven months of work. Based on past major work experience, in terms of building political power, the original establishment and regions of the newly liberated areas should not be changed; in pastoral areas, the original and diverse organizational forms should be adopted. Secondly, the joint ethnic political power and preliminary regional autonomy political power should be improved and strengthened, and cadres from all ethnic groups should be widely absorbed to participate in work, and these cadres should be patiently and specifically helped. They should be boldly used so that they can truly have position, power, and responsibility. In resolving disputes, a combination of specific understanding, individual deliberation, and general meeting resolution should be carried out. Among the cadres working in the entire Qinghai region, Han cadres from outside account for the absolute majority. Most of them do not have experience in working in multi-ethnic regions, and some have shown simple, impatient, rigid, and outdated work styles. Therefore, many detours have been taken in the work, which should be corrected in a timely manner.

　　执行人民政府民族政策
    青海少数民族工作获成绩
    【本报讯】本报特约记者乔迁报道：青海省人民政府成立以来，在少数民族的工作上，已获得很大成绩。
    首先在建政方面的成绩。青海省共有七个民族，关系交错。全省共二十三个行政单位，在农业区及以农业为主的区域，已建立十四个县的民族联合政权，改造了六十个区、二百六十个乡政权，并按聚居和杂居情况，分别按民族比例，使各兄弟民族都参加了区乡政权。互助、大通、玉树、称多、囊谦等五个县，现正建立或准备建立县级联合政权。
    第二、培养兄弟民族干部是开展一切工作的关键。解放以来，青海省人民政府对这一工作十分重视。现全省参加乡以上政权工作的兄弟民族干部，据初步统计，有二百二十七人（主要是农业区）。在学校教育方面，去年举办了青年干部训练班，今年改为人民公学，专门培养各兄弟民族干部，计前后共收当地兄弟民族学生二百三十六人，已派出参加工作的五十九人。
    第三、用平等协商、调解、检讨等方式，圆满解决了民族纠纷二十一件，如互助县芳惠渠的回汉民族纠纷，湟中县峡峻寺寺院和农民的土地纠纷等。这些纠纷的圆满解决，更进一步加强了各民族之间的团结，逐渐消除历史上的民族隔阂。
    第四、今年一月召开了省民族联谊会后，在农业区十三个县先后召开了一次各族各界代表会议，有些县市召开了两次至三次，在代表的民族成份上，兄弟民族代表约占三分之一强。会上主要讨论了团结、治安、生产等问题。通过此次代表会议，宣传了人民政府的各项政策，密切了政府与各族人民的联系，提高了群众的政治认识，加强了民族团结。
    自青海省人民政府成立以来，在七个月的工作中，已开始使民族政策和具体情况相结合。根据过去的主要工作经验，在建政上，新解放区原来的建制和区域不要变；在牧区应采用原有的和多样性的组织形式；其次要健全、充实民族联合政权及初步的区域自治政权，广泛吸收各族干部参加工作，并要耐心、具体的帮助这些干部，对他们要大胆使用，以便真正做到有职、有权、有责。在调解纠纷上要具体了解、个别酝酿、大会解决三方面结合进行。在整个青海地区工作的干部中，外来的汉族干部占绝对多数，他们大多没有在多民族地区工作的经验，有些表现了简单、急躁、生硬、搬运老一套的工作作风，因此在工作中走了许多弯路，应该及时加以纠正。
