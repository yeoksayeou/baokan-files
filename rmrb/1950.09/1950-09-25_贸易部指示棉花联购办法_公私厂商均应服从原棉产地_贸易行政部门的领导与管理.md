　　Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: To balance the supply and demand of raw cotton and prevent blind competition, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Joint Public-Private Cotton Purchasing and Cotton Market Management" on September 2, which made specific provisions for joint cotton purchasing and market management. The instructions pointed out that joint public-private yarn factory cotton purchasing organizations should be established in important textile industrial cities, under the leadership of local trade administrative departments and textile administration bureaus. State-owned textile companies should participate as representatives of state-owned factories, and private textile factories should participate in the joint purchasing organizations as much as possible to conduct joint purchasing, formulate joint purchasing plans, pool funds, and distribute raw cotton according to the proportion of investment. Factories participating in the joint purchase should no longer purchase on their own or entrust cotton merchants to purchase on their behalf. However, in addition to participating in investment, factories may simultaneously entrust the joint purchasing organization to purchase raw cotton on their behalf.

　　The instructions stipulate that local cotton merchants may participate in the above-mentioned joint purchasing organizations, but may also organize their own cotton merchant joint purchases. The business methods of the latter shall be determined by the participating cotton merchants themselves, and local trade administrative departments and state-owned textile companies shall provide practical assistance. Each region can decide which of the above two methods to adopt. Whether state-owned textile companies should also purchase on their own after participating in the joint purchase shall be decided by the local municipal trade administrative departments leading the joint purchasing agencies in discussion.

　　The instructions emphasized that all public and private manufacturers participating in the joint purchase in various places shall obey the leadership and management of the local trade administrative departments when going to the producing areas to purchase raw cotton. The government should provide guidance and assistance to those who abide by government policies and regulations. In certain larger key distribution markets, under the leadership of the local industry and commerce bureau, a joint cotton purchase committee composed of local and foreign manufacturers and joint purchasing organizations can be formed to control market prices and quality and avoid blind competition. The instructions stated that all manufacturers who do not participate in the joint purchase are free to go to the producing areas to purchase, but should obey all the relevant market management and cotton price policies of the local government, and local governments should also provide convenience and guidance. The instructions pointed out that if cotton merchants in various places reduce quality, drive up market prices, disrupt the market, engage in speculation, or add water or impurities when purchasing raw cotton, the local government should ban them in accordance with the law.

　　贸易部指示棉花联购办法
    公私厂商均应服从原棉产地
    贸易行政部门的领导与管理
    【新华社二十二日讯】中央人民政府贸易部为使原棉供需平衡，防止盲目争购，在九月二日发布的“关于公私联合购棉及棉花市场管理的指示”中对棉花联购及市场管理工作作了若干具体规定。指示指出，在重要纺织工业城市，均应组织公私纱厂联合购棉组织，由当地贸易行政部门及纺织管理局负责领导，国营花纱布公司代表公营厂参加，私营纺织厂则应尽可能组织在联购机构中进行联购，统一制订联购计划，统筹资金，按出资比例分配原棉。凡已参加联购之各厂，不再自购或自行委托棉商代购。但各厂除参加投资外，得同时采用委托方式委托联购机构代购原棉。
    指示规定，各地棉商，可参加上述联购组织，但亦可另外自行组织棉商联购。后者之经营方式由参加棉商自行商定，各地贸易行政部门与国营花纱布公司应切实给予协助。以上两种办法可由各区自行决定采用。国营花纱布公司参加联购后是否还另外自购，亦由各市贸易行政部门领导各该联购机关讨论决定。
    指示强调，凡各地参加联购之公私厂商赴产地采购原棉，均应服从当地贸易行政部门领导与管理。其遵守政府政策法令者，政府应给予指导与协助。某些较大的重点集散市场，在当地工商局领导下，可根据情况联合当地及外来厂商及联购组织组成棉花采购联合委员会，掌握市场价格与质量，避免盲目争购。指示说，凡不参加联购之厂商均得自由赴产地进行采购，但应服从当地政府有关市场管理与棉价政策之一切规定，各地政府亦应予以便利及指导。指示指出，各地棉商在收购原棉时，如有降低质量、哄抬市价、扰乱市场、进行投机及掺水使杂等行为者，当地政府应依法予以取缔。
