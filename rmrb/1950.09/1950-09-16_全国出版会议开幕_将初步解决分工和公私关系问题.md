Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The first National Publishing Conference, convened by the General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government, opened in Beijing on the 15th. Participants included 316 representatives and experts from state-owned, joint public-private, and private publishing, distribution, printing, and magazine industries in various regions, as well as publishing administrative organs and printing industry trade unions from the central and local levels. The main purpose of this conference is to understand the situation of the national publishing industry, to initially resolve the issues of unified division of labor and public-private relationships within the publishing industry, and to gradually promote the national publishing industry in a planned manner based on this.

Guo Moruo, Director of the Central Cultural and Educational Committee, Wu Yuzhang, Member of the Central People's Government Committee, Shen Yanbing, Minister of the Central Ministry of Culture, Li Dequan, Minister of the Central Ministry of Health, and Wei Que, Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Education, attended the meeting to provide guidance. Ye Shengtao, Deputy Director of the General Administration of Publications, delivered the opening speech. He pointed out that the publication, printing, and distribution of books and magazines nationwide must be considered as a whole, taking all aspects into consideration, and cooperating through division of labor. Overall consideration ensures that we do not favor certain aspects; taking all aspects into consideration ensures that we do not disadvantage certain aspects; division of labor allows us to strive for excellence; cooperation allows us to complement each other. This is the direction of the publishing industry under New Democracy.

The National Publishing Exhibition, organized by the Preparatory Committee of the Publishing Conference, is also scheduled to open on the 17th at Beihai Park in Beijing.

　　全国出版会议开幕
    将初步解决分工和公私关系问题
    【新华社十五日讯】中央人民政府出版总署召开的第一届全国出版会议于十五日在北京开幕。参加这次会议的有各地区的公营、公私合营和私营的出版、发行、印刷、杂志业和中央与地方的出版行政机关、印刷业工会的代表和专家等共三百十六人。这次会议的目的，主要是了解全国出版业的情况，初步解决出版业中的统一分工和公私关系问题，并以此为基础，有计划地逐步推进全国出版事业。
    中央文教委员会主任郭沫若、中央人民政府委员会委员吴玉章、中央文化部部长沈雁冰、中央卫生部部长李德全、中央教育部副部长韦悫等都到会指导。出版总署副署长叶圣陶致开幕词。他指出全国图书杂志的出版、印刷、发行事业必须统筹兼顾，分工合作。统筹，才不至于偏在某些方面；兼顾，才不至于亏了某些方面；分工，才可以精益求精；合作，才可以相辅相成。这样才是新民主主义之下出版事业的方向。
    出版会议筹备委员会主办的全国出版事业展览会也定于十七日在北京北海公园揭幕。
