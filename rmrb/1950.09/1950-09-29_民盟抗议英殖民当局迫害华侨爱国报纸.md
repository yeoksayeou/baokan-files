　　Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: The spokesperson for the China Democratic League issued the following statement regarding the unreasonable closure of patriotic overseas Chinese newspapers by the British colonial authorities in Malaya:
    For several months, the British colonial authorities in Malaya have repeatedly invoked the so-called "Emergency Ordinance" to persecute overseas Chinese, with constant incidents of arresting or expelling them. Recently, they have become even more brazen. After failing to achieve their goals through threats, inducements, and intimidation, they unreasonably closed the Singapore's *Nanyang Siang Pau* and Penang's *Modern Daily* on September 21st. The general manager and editor-in-chief of *Nanyang Siang Pau* were also detained. This tyrannical and despicable behavior is another manifestation of the British government's unfriendly attitude towards China. This is truly intolerable for us Chinese people.
    *Nanyang Siang Pau* and *Modern Daily* are patriotic newspapers founded by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. These two newspapers have consistently promoted the policies of the Central People's Government and called on overseas Chinese to love their motherland. The British imperialist colonial authorities' arbitrary and unreasonable closure of the two newspapers not only exposes the true face of British imperialism but also is a great irony to their so-called "democracy" and "freedom."
    As early as May 20th of this year, the League pointed out the two-faced nature of British foreign policy and repeatedly exposed and denounced its unfriendly attitudes and behaviors. Now, we specifically warn the British colonial authorities that their tyrannical measures of destroying overseas Chinese public opinion and carrying out ideological enslavement have aroused the anger of the broad masses of the Chinese people. We firmly demand that the British colonial authorities immediately unseal the two newspapers and release the illegally arrested staff members of the newspaper offices; otherwise, the British government's unfriendly behavior towards China will surely reap its own bitter fruit.

　　民盟抗议英殖民当局迫害华侨爱国报纸
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国民主同盟发言人为马来亚英殖民当局无理封闭华侨爱国报纸一事发表谈话如下：
    数月以来，马来亚英殖民当局一再援引所谓“紧急法令”迫害华侨，逮捕或驱逐华侨的事件不断发生。近更变本加厉，在威胁、利诱、恫吓等手段失败后，竟于九月二十一日将新加坡《南侨日报》和槟榔屿《现代日报》无理封闭。南侨日报的总经理、总编辑并遭拘押。这种横暴可耻的行为，是英国政府对中国不友好态度的又一表现。这实在为我们中国人民所不能容忍。
    《南侨日报》和《现代日报》是南洋华侨创办的爱国报纸。这两个报纸一向宣扬中央人民政府的政策，号召侨胞热爱祖国。英帝国主义殖民统治当局这次蛮横无理地将两报封闭，不仅暴露了英帝国主义的本来面目，而且也是对他们一向标榜的所谓“民主”“自由”的极大讽刺。
    本盟早在本年五月二十日就指出了英国外交政策的两面性，对其不友好的态度和行为，曾一再加以揭露和指责。现在我们特再警告英殖民当局，他们这种摧毁华侨舆论，进行思想奴役的蛮横措施，已激起广大中国人民的愤怒。我们坚决要求英殖民当局立即启封两报，并释放非法逮捕的报馆工作人员；否则，英国政府对我们中国这种不友好的行为，必将自食其果。
