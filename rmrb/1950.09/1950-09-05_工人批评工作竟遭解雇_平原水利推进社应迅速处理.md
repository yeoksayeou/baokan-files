Worker Dismissed for Criticizing Work

Pingyuan Water Conservancy Promotion Agency Should Handle It Promptly

To the Editorial Staff:

　　Workers such as Zhen Xingyin from the Pingyuan Province Agricultural Department's Water Conservancy Promotion Agency were dismissed for making beneficial criticisms and suggestions regarding the agency's work. The Pingyuan Daily has already criticized this matter and expressed its firm support for the correct criticisms of Zhen Xingyin and others. The Pingyuan Provincial Labor Bureau, the Xinxiang City Trade Union Preparatory Committee, and readers of the Pingyuan Daily have also written to the Pingyuan Daily, supporting their correct criticisms. However, this matter has not been thoroughly resolved even now. Therefore, I am telling you the facts, hoping you will publish them to urge the Pingyuan Provincial Water Conservancy Promotion Agency and its superior authorities to handle this matter promptly.

　　The facts are as follows: Zhen Xingyin, Zhao Guoliang, and four others originally worked at the Pingyuan Provincial Agricultural Department's Water Conservancy Promotion Agency installing waterwheel chains. They discovered that many of the "rivet baskets" used for installing the chains were of varying sizes and not hammered flat, and the "iron washers" were also made in different sizes. Therefore, they suggested to the comrades of the storage section of the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency: "In the future, you must carefully inspect the goods upon receipt and not accept unsuitable goods to avoid delaying work and causing losses to state property." The comrades of the storage section not only did not accept their opinions but also became very angry. Lu Yongfa of the section irresponsibly said: "The iron factories that deliver the goods are all acquaintances. How can we conduct strict inspections? It would offend people."

　　On June 12, Zhen Xingyin and others wrote to the Pingyuan Daily, reflecting the situation. After the newspaper sent someone to the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency to understand the true situation, it made criticisms and suggestions to the agency. The comrades of the storage section immediately admitted their mistakes and made self-criticisms. After that, the goods delivered by the iron factories were better than before. However, in less than a week, the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency told the workers who had made the suggestions for improvement: "There are not many chains now. The waterwheel chains need to be stopped for a while." They had to stop working and wait.

　　During the shutdown, they went to the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency to ask if they could start work, but the comrades of the storage section made excuses to avoid them. On June 21, worker Zhao Guoliang met Chen Wanchun, the head of the storage section, on the street and talked about writing to the newspaper to criticize the work. Chen Wanchun said, "I can use anyone. Why would I look for you to criticize me?" At the same time, the workers also saw that the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency was indeed hiring other workers to install the waterwheel chains. Only then did they realize that the agency intended to dismiss them, and the so-called lack of chains was just an excuse.

　　Therefore, Zhen Xingyin wrote to the Pingyuan Daily, reflecting the situation. The Pingyuan Daily published Zhen Xingyin's letter on August 6, and published a short commentary entitled "Protect Correct Criticism, Oppose Retaliation!" pointing out that the comrades of the Pingyuan Provincial Water Conservancy Promotion Agency were wrong to adopt a retaliatory attitude toward criticism. It suggested that the competent authorities of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government thoroughly investigate this matter and give strict criticism and punishment to those bureaucratic elements who disregarded the opinions of the masses and took retaliatory actions against criticism.

　　On August 25, the Pingyuan Daily also published letters from the Pingyuan Provincial Labor Bureau, the Xinxiang City Trade Union Preparatory Committee, and readers of the newspaper regarding this matter. The letter from the Pingyuan Provincial Labor Bureau stated: "The actions of Chen Wanchun, the head of the storage section of the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency, violated labor policies and labor laws, and violated the basic line of relying on the working class to develop production." In addition to ordering the Xinxiang Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau to inspect the agency and handle it promptly, the Pingyuan Provincial Labor Bureau made the following suggestions: (1) It is suggested that the Provincial Agricultural Department strictly deal with the personnel involved in the issue and order them to publicly admit their mistakes. (2) If the agency currently needs to install waterwheel chains, the dismissed Zhen Xingyin and others should be immediately reinstated; if there are currently no waterwheel chains that need to be installed, Zhen and others will still have priority for reinstatement in the future. (3) The wages that the dismissed workers should have been paid during the period of their dismissal from the date of dismissal should be fully paid. The letter from the Xinxiang City Trade Union Preparatory Committee pointed out that in addition to this matter, the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency also had other issues of suppressing workers and not relying on the working masses to manage the factory and develop production. In addition to agreeing with the handling opinions of the Provincial Labor Bureau, they also requested that the Provincial Agricultural Department pay attention to this issue, inspect the work of the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency, and specifically help the leading cadres of the agency improve their political level, strengthen their policy awareness, and improve their future work.

　　On the same day, the Pingyuan Daily also published a short letter from the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency. The letter stated: Regarding this matter, they have studied for six days in conjunction with the Provincial Government's "Instructions on Implementing the Party Central Committee's 'Decision to Launch Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications'"; they originally wanted to reply quickly, but there were many unclear situations that were difficult to analyze and could not lead to a conclusion. They are now actively conducting inspections in conjunction with the rectification campaign, and once all the facts are clarified, they will report them to the newspaper for publication.

　　I believe that the support of the Pingyuan Daily and the Pingyuan Provincial Labor Bureau and other agencies for the beneficial criticisms of workers such as Zhen Xingyin has had a good effect on correctly launching criticism and self-criticism. The Pingyuan Provincial Water Conservancy Promotion Agency should promptly investigate and handle this matter, give appropriate punishment to those who suppress and retaliate against critics, so that the agency can improve its work with the active help of the working masses.

Editor's Note: The suppressive attitude adopted by the Pingyuan Provincial Water Conservancy Promotion Agency towards the criticisms of the working masses shows that they completely do not understand the meaning of launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers. Their two-faced attitude and retaliatory behavior (dismissing workers) towards those who make criticisms and suggestions are intolerable and extremely bad behavior. In order to correct this behavior, we suggest that the relevant departments of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government should promptly conduct a thorough investigation and serious handling of this matter; those directly responsible should be given the necessary punishment and announced to the public.

### 工人批评工作竟遭解雇  平原水利推进社应迅速处理

　　工人批评工作竟遭解雇
    平原水利推进社应迅速处理编辑同志：
    平原省农业厅水利推进社工人甄兴尹等，因对该社工作提出有益的批评和建议，竟遭解雇。平原日报已经批评了这件事情，并表示坚决支持甄兴尹等的正确批评。平原省劳动局、新乡市工会筹备会及平原日报读者们，也纷纷写信给平原日报，支持他们的正确批评。但是，直到现在，这件事还没有彻底解决。因此，我把事实经过告诉你们，希望你们发表，以督促平原省水利推进社及其上级机关迅速处理这件事情。
    事实经过是这样的：甄兴尹、赵国良等六人，原在平原省农业厅水利推进社做按装水车链子的工作。他们曾发现不少装链子用的“铆蓝”有大有小，而且打得不平，“铁钱”的大小也做得不一样。因此就向水利推进社保管股的同志提出建议：“今后在收货时必须认真检查，不合适的货不收，以免耽误工作，使国家资财受到损失。”保管股的同志们不但不接受他们的意见，反而大发脾气。该股路永发还不负责任地说：“送货的铁工厂都是熟人，怎能做严格的检查，这会得罪人的。”
    甄兴尹等就在六月十二日写信给平原日报社，反映了这件事的经过情形。报社派人到水利推进社了解真实情况之后，向该社提出了批评与建议。保管股的同志当即承认了错误，作了检查。此后，各铁工厂交的货就比过去要好些了。但是不到一个星期，水利推进社竟向提出改进意见的工人们说：“现在链子不多，水车链子需要停些日子再上。”他们只好歇工等着。
    在停工时期，他们曾到水利推进社去问是否可以开工，该社保管股同志们借词推托。六月二十一日，工人赵国良在街上遇到保管股股长陈万春，谈到给报社写信批评工作的问题时，陈万春说：“我用谁都可以，何必找你们来批评呢？”同时，工人们又看到水利推进社的确另找工人来按装水车链子。这时候他们才知道社方要把他们解雇，所谓没有链子，只是一个借口而已。
    于是，甄兴尹就写信给平原日报，反映这种情况。平原日报在八月六日发表了甄兴尹的来信，并以《保护正确的批评，反对报复行动！》为题发表短论，指出平原省水利推进社同志，对批评采取报复的态度是错误的。建议平原省人民政府主管机关彻查这件事情，并给那些漠视群众意见，对批评采取报复行为的官僚主义分子以严格批评与处分。
    八月二十五日，平原日报又发表了平原省劳动局，新乡市工会筹备会和该报读者关于这件事情的来信。平原省劳动局的来信说：“水利推进社保管股长陈万春等这样作法，违犯了劳动政策、劳动法令，违犯了依靠工人阶级发展生产的基本路线。”平原省劳动局除已令新乡市人民政府劳动局对该社进行检查，予以迅速处理外，并提出以下几项建议：（一）建议省府农业厅严格处理与该问题有关的人员，并令其公开承认错误。（二）该社现在如有水车链子需要按装，应使被解雇的甄兴尹等立即复工；如目前没有水车链子需要按装，将来甄等仍有复工的优先权。（三）自解雇之日起，被解雇工人在被解雇期间应发之工资，应如数补发。新乡市工会筹备会来信指出，除了这件事以外，水利推进社还存在着其他压制工人，不依靠工人群众管理工厂，发展生产的事情。他们除同意省府劳动局的处理意见外，并要求省府农业厅重视这个问题，检查水利推进社的工作，具体帮助该社领导干部提高政治水平、加强政策观念，改进今后工作。
    同日，平原日报还刊登了水利推进社的一封短信。信中说：关于这件事，他们已结合省府关于“贯彻党中央‘在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定’的指示”学习六天了；本想赶快答复，奈有许多情况弄不清，不好分析，不能得出结论。现正结合整风积极进行检查中，一旦将全部事实弄清楚，即转报纸发表。
    我认为平原日报以及平原省劳动局等机关对于甄兴尹等工人有益的批评的支持，对正确地展开批评和自我批评，已经有了很好的作用。平原省水利推进社应该迅速地检查、处理这件事情，给压制、报复批评者以适当处分，使该社能在工人群众的积极帮助下改进工作。

                                               八月二十六日
    编者按：平原省水利推进社对于工人群众的批评所采取的压制态度，表现他们完全不了解在报纸上开展批评与自我批评的意义。他们对批评建议者所采取的两面态度与报复行为（解雇工人），是不能容忍的极端恶劣的行为。为了纠正这种行为，我们建议平原省人民政府有关部门对此应迅速进行彻底的检查和认真的处理；对直接负责者应给以必要的处分，并予公布。
