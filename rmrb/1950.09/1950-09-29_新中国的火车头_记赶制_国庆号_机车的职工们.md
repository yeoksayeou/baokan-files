　　The New China's Locomotive
    ——A Record of the Workers Rushing to Build the "National Day" Locomotive
    Li Jiuzhe
    In mid-August, the Qingdao Sifang Railway Factory's entire factory workers' representative meeting passed a resolution: to make a brand-new locomotive to present to Chairman Mao as a gift for National Day, to express the love of all the workers for the country.

    This resolution quickly spread to every workshop and every production team, and every worker expressed the desire to make their assigned work of good quality and beautiful. As soon as the detailed list of parts for the new train was distributed to the factory, everyone immediately started working. The best materials were used, and the highest-skilled workers were assigned to take charge. Every worker felt that being able to work on the new locomotive being presented for National Day, even if it was just riveting a rivet or turning a small screw, was a great honor and fortune.

    "It's being sent to Chairman Mao!"
    "It's for the country's birthday!"
    People boasted and urged each other on while working on the new locomotive. In fact, no one needed urging, and everyone's work was already up to standard and beautiful enough. The sand molders in the foundry proposed at the production team meeting that they would guarantee that there would be no sand holes in the cast parts when they received the new car task. This was something they would never have dared to dream of during the time of the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang. But this time, the air distribution valve, automatic brake valve, and triple valve cast by the young sand molders Tang Zongyu and his partners were truly excellent, without a single sand hole. The workers in the frame shop riveted the rivets on the water tank as straight as a line, with only three rivets out of more than five thousand being crooked, which were then burned off with "gas" and re-riveted. The old riveter Wang Jiming worked hard under the water tank, happily shouting, "I will definitely make it beautiful and hang it on the locomotive to see Chairman Mao." The lathe operators and grinding machine operators in the machine shop not only made the work on the new car regular, but also specially processed and polished the rocker arm, large tie rod, cylinder head, and screw cap.

    As soon as September arrived, Sundays became days of voluntary labor. Workers scrambled to volunteer for voluntary labor on Sundays. One hundred people participated in the voluntary labor twice, for a total of more than six hundred hours of work. Both work efficiency and work quality were very high. The seventy-seven voluntary laborers in the locomotive shop completed all the processing tasks of rocker arms, tie rods, eccentric rods, connecting rods, driving wheels, and guide wheels within six o'clock, and also installed various copper fittings and the pipes of the brake section and water pump section.

    The high level of labor enthusiasm marked the new patriotism of the working class. The voluntary laborers all arrived at the site early. On September 17 (Sunday), although old worker Jia Peimou's son was getting married in two days and many things were not yet prepared, he was already at the site before 6:30 that day, starting to wipe the driving wheel journal. Others called out to him, "Master Jia, it's not time yet!" He did not stop the work in his hands and said, "It doesn't matter what time it is today! Just do more work." There was no electricity all day on Sunday, and the crane could not be started, so the workers carried the more than two hundred jin heavy axle box beams one by one from the machine shop.

    The "five-dynasty veteran" in the locomotive shop—Wang Dianhua, who is sixty-eight years old this year, has gone through one German rule, two Japanese devil rules, and two Kuomintang reactionary rules in the factory from the first year of the Republic of China to the present. He recounted to the reporter the suffering he had suffered in the past. He said that he was simply a beast of burden his whole life. When the German devils were here, they would be slapped in the face if they went the wrong way to the toilet. When the Japanese devils were here, they treated the workers even more cruelly. The workers were beaten every day, and if they got sick from hard work, they deserved it and would be fired. Finally, the Kuomintang "takeover" came, and they嫌he was old and wanted him to "retire." Later, he was barely kept, but his salary could not support his family. As soon as he was paid, he had to rush to the street, otherwise, he would not be able to buy anything if he left it for a day. Today, he has turned over and become conscious. He said happily, "I am a slave of five dynasties and today I am the master." Now, he and his son work for the country, supporting a family of eight, and also providing a grandson and a granddaughter to attend middle school. Life can be quite good. On the day of voluntary labor, he saved a piece of gauze while polishing "oil pots" and "oil plugs." They were all polished with used and old gauze picked up from the ground. He said that although a piece of gauze is not worth anything, it always saves a little something for the country!

    This old worker did not hide his pleasant mood after becoming the master of the country. He said that in the past, the relationship between workers and the factory was that they would get a day's salary for going to the factory for a day. They would do a little work in front of the director, and if they were not in front of them, they would take a break and have a cigarette. Now that they have their own country, the work of the factory has become the work of the workers themselves. They don't need the director and foreman to watch them. Once the task is assigned, they can complete the task on time, and they can also create a new record. He said with a smiling face: "Now I can do the work I used to do in three days in one day."

    A beautiful, brand-new locomotive was quickly made. Its name is "National Day." It is brand new all over, and every part is shining. Every part of this brand-new locomotive, except for the frame and the large driving wheels—which, according to Liu Wei, the factory director, the factory can also manufacture, but there is currently no production of this kind of steel—are all manufactured by the workers of the factory themselves. This is the unparalleled creativity of the working class. Taking the most important parts of the locomotive—the oil pump, air pump, water pump, air distribution valve, and automatic brake valve—as examples, this factory could not manufacture these during the time of the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang rule. However, the liberated workers, under the leadership of the People's Government, can completely manufacture these parts. And the quality of the manufactured parts is not worse than that of imported goods.

    The automatic brake valve is a very small part of the automatic device, but without it, the car cannot be dispatched. After the Kuomintang reactionaries "took over" Qingdao, dozens of locomotives were stopped dead and could not leave the factory because there was no automatic brake valve. Cao Junmi, a member of the Communist Youth League, was a worker in the automatic department at that time. He clearly saw that situation at the time, but he never thought that he would also create it himself. Just after liberation, automatic brake valves were still very scarce, and they could only cope by dismantling the east wall to make up for the west wall, and sometimes they would adjust a few from other places. However, this young worker in his twenties saw this situation and his heart moved: "If foreigners can create, can't we Chinese create it?" The People's Government's rewards for inventions and creations encouraged him. He first studied with foreman Wang Quanxian, and then contacted the sand molders in the foundry and the lathe operators in the machine shop. He proposed to work together to create an automatic brake valve. The administration also gave strong support. So the foundry tried to make models. Cao Junmi and several buddies painted the finished automatic brake valve, printed it on paper, and then engraved it on an iron plate for use as a blueprint because the machine shop lacked blueprints. There are several oblique eyes on the American-made automatic brake valve, and we don’t have this kind of machine to drill them. Cao Junmi studied and drilled curved eyes instead of oblique eyes. When the finished product was made, there was no machine to test it, so Cao Junmi repaired an "ET Six" automatic brake valve test bench that had not been used before. In this way, the automatic brake valve was successfully manufactured. Its sensitivity is completely in accordance with the standard, ensuring on-time dispatch. On the day of voluntary labor, this young worker was rushing to install his newly created automatic brake valve and the air distribution valve he had just successfully tested. He said: "The National Day gift is of great significance, and I must use our own creation on the new locomotive."

    After finishing the work on the new locomotive, the sand molders in the foundry happily talked about a joke from the past. They said that when the Japanese devils were here, there was a fat devil named Yokota who cast ten cylinder sleeves and broke ten of them. Later, another devil named Iwatani came and said that Yokota was as stupid as a pig, but he himself cast twelve cylinder sleeves and broke eleven. The remaining one could only be used after welding and filling in the sand holes. But now the young sand molders have created the "clarification method", and the sand molding is also particularly careful. Not to mention a large cylinder sleeve, even the most difficult and delicate air distribution valve and automatic brake valve are cast ten for ten without a single sand hole. Therefore, they received commendations from the Central Ministry of Railways.

    These are not miracles. This is the infinite creativity that the working class inherently possesses. It is only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, after the working class has become the master of the country, that this creativity can be brought into play.

　　新中国的火车头
    ——记赶制“国庆号”机车的职工们
    李久泽
    八月中旬，青岛四方铁路工厂全厂职工代表会议上通过了这样一个决议：做一台全新的火车头献给毛主席，作为国庆日的礼物，以表示全体工人弟兄对国家的热爱。
    这个决议，很快地传到了各个车间、各个生产小组，每个工人都表示要把自己所分配的那部分活，做得质量好，又漂亮。新车零件的明细表一分到场子里，大家就立时动起手来。使最好的材料做，派最高的技术工人来担当。每个工人都感到，能给国庆献礼的新火车头上做一点活，那怕是铆一个铆钉，或者是旋一个小螺丝，那都是莫大的光荣和幸运。
    “送给毛主席的呵！”
    “给国家做生日的呵！”
    人们一面做着新火车头上的活，一面这样夸耀着，互相督促着。其实，谁都用不着督促，每个人做的那部分活已经够标准，够漂亮了。铸工场的翻沙工，一接到新车的任务就在生产小组会上提出，保证铸的零件没有一个沙眼。这是在日本鬼子和国民党时代做梦也不敢想的。可是这次，年轻的翻沙工唐宗玉和他的伙伴们铸的空气分配阀、自动司轫阀和三道阀，真就是呱呱叫，没有一个沙眼。车架场的工人们做的煤水箱，铆钉铆的简直就是一条线，五千多个铆钉中只铆歪了三个，还用“葛斯”烧下来重铆。老铆工王吉明爬在煤水箱底下吃力地工作着，高兴地叫着：“一定做的它漂漂亮亮的，挂到火车头上去见毛主席。”机械场的旋床工、擦床工们，新车上的活不但做的规矩，而且还把摇连杆、大拉杆、汽缸盖、螺丝帽等特地加工磨光了。
    一进九月，星期日变成了义务劳动日。工友们争先恐后地自动要求星期日参加义务劳动。两次参加义务劳动的有一百人，共计劳动六百多个小时。工作效率和工作质量都非常高。机车场七十七名义务劳动者，六点钟内完成了全部摇连杆、拉杆、偏心杆、结合杆、动轮、导轮等的加工任务，还按装完了各种铜配件和制动部水泵部的管子。
    高度的劳动热情，标志着工人阶级新的爱国主义精神。义务劳动者都是提前赶到现场。九月十七日（星期日），老工人贾培谋虽然在两天后他的儿子就要结婚，很多东西还没预备好，可是这天不到六点半钟，他已经在现场动手擦起动轮轴头来了。别人喊他：“贾师傅还不到点呀！”他不停止手中的工作说：“今天不论点啦！多出活就行。”星期日整天没有电，吊车不能开动，工人们便把二百多斤重的轴箱横梁从机械场里一根根的抬过来。
    机车场里的“五朝元老”——今年六十八岁的王殿华，他从民国元年到现在，在厂中经过了一次德寇的统治、两次日本鬼子的统治、两次国民党反动派的统治。他对记者历述了过去所受的痛苦。他说简直就是当牛当马一辈子。德国鬼子在这里时，上厕所走错了道就挨耳光。日本鬼子在这里时，对待工人更残暴，工人每天都得挨揍，干活累出病来活该，开除。末后又来了国民党的“劫收”，嫌他老，又要他“退休”。以后好歹留下了，工资不能养家活口，开下钱来还得快往街上跑，要不，搁一天就买不到啥了。今天，他翻了身，觉悟了，他高兴地说：“我这是五朝奴隶今天当主人。”现在，他和儿子两个人给国家作工，养活着一家八口人，还供给一个孙子、一个孙女上中学。生活满可以过得去。义务劳动的这天，他在磨光“油壶”、“油堵”等的工作中节省下了一张沙布。都是用拣的地上那些用过的和旧的沙布磨光的。他说，一张沙布虽不值什么，可总是替国家节省下了一点点东西呵！
    这位老工人毫不掩饰他当了国家主人后的愉快心情。他说从前工人对待工厂，就是进一天工厂要一天工资的关系。上仕在眼前干点，不在眼前就歇歇吃袋烟。现在有了自己的国家，工厂的活都变成工人自己的活了，也不用主任和工长在眼前看着，任务一分下来，到时候就能完成任务，还都能创造个新纪录。他笑容满面的说：“现在我一天能作我从前三天所作的工作了。”
    一台漂亮的全新的火车头迅速地制成了。它的名字就叫“国庆号”。它周身崭新，每个零件都发着光。这崭新的火车头上的每一个零件，除去车架、大动轮——这些，据该厂的刘伟厂长谈，这个厂子也是可以制造的，只是目前没有出产这种钢料——都是该厂工人自己制造的。这就是工人阶级无比的创造力。以火车头上最重要的部分——油泵、风泵、水泵、空气分配阀，自动司轫阀为例，这些，在日本鬼子和国民党统治时代，这个厂子都是不能制造的。但是，解放了的工人，在人民政府的领导下，就完全可以制造这些零件了。而且造的并不比舶来品差。
    自动司轫阀是自动装置中很小的一个零件，可是没有它就不能出车。国民党反动派“接收”青岛后，这个厂子就是因为没有自动司轫阀，几十个火车头死死地停下来不能出厂。青年团员曹俊密那时是自动部的工人。当时他是清楚地看到了那种情形的，可是他绝没有想到自己也要创造。刚解放后，自动司轫阀还是非常缺乏，只能拆东墙补西墙的应付，有时也从别地调剂几个来。可是，这个二十几岁的青年工人看到这种情形，心里便活动起来了：“外国人能创造，咱中国就不能创造吗？”人民政府的奖励创造发明鼓舞着他。他先和工长王泉先研究，又去联络了铸工场的翻沙工和机械场的旋床工。他提议合力创造自动司轫阀。行政上也给予了有力的支持。于是铸工场里就试制模型。机械场里划线没有蓝图，曹俊密就和几个伙计，把自动司轫阀的成品上涂上颜色，用纸印下来，再刻到铁板上当蓝图用。美国造的自动司轫阀上有几个斜眼，我们没有这种机器不能钻，曹俊密就研究了钻曲眼代替斜眼。成品制出来了，没有机器试验，曹俊密又把一架从前没有用过的“ＥＴ六”号自动司轫阀试验台装修好。就这样，自动司轫阀制造成功了。它的灵敏程度完全合乎标准，保证了按时出车。义务劳动的那天，这个青年工人就是在赶装他新造的自动司轫阀和他刚试验成功的空气分配阀。他说：“国庆献礼意义重大，我一定要把我们自己的创造用到新火车头上。”
    铸工场的翻沙工们忙完了新火车头上的活之后，愉快地谈起过去的一个笑话来。他们说，从前日本鬼子在这里时，有一个胖鬼子叫横田，他铸汽缸套铸了十个就坏了十个。以后又来了个鬼子叫岩谷，他说横田笨得像猪，但他自己铸了十二个汽缸套坏了十一个，剩下的那个，还是烧焊弥补了沙眼才能用。可是现在年青的翻沙工们创造了“澄清法”，翻沙也翻得格外仔细，不用说一个大汽缸套，就是最难铸的小巧玲珑的空气分配阀、自动司轫阀，也都是铸十个好十个，没有一个沙眼。因此，他们得到了中央铁道部的嘉奖。
    这些，并不是什么奇迹。这是工人阶级本来就具有的无穷创造力，只是这种创造力，在共产党和人民政府领导之下，从工人阶级当了国家的主人之后才能发挥出来。
        一九五○年九月二十三日于青岛
