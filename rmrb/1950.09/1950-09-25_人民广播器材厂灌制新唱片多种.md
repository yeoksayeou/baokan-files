　　People's Broadcasting Equipment Factory Produces Multiple New Records
    Since moving from Shanghai to Beijing, the People's Broadcasting Equipment Factory has been actively producing new records. In order to widely introduce the famous opera "The White Haired Girl," the factory specially invited the Opera Troupe of the Central Academy of Drama to record selections from "The White Haired Girl," including five records of "The North Wind Blows," "Red Hair Ribbon," and "Sunlight Shines on Grievances," sung by Guo Lanying and Wang Kun as Xi'er, Qian Min as Yang Bailao, and Zhang Wei as Second Aunt. These have already been published.
    To welcome the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth recently visiting Beijing, the factory specially commissioned the Youth Art Theater to record the "International Student Union Anthem," with lyrics translated by Zhu Ziqi and Xiao San, and music composed by Ren Hong. The factory also invited the Youth Service Singing Team to sing the standard version of "March of the World Democratic Youth" and "Song of the Youth League," which have also been published.
    In order to promote folk forms of storytelling and singing, in addition to recording Shandong Kuaishu, Shanghai Opera, and Yangzhou Opera in Shanghai, the factory has recently recorded new records of folk art with new content, including Jingyun Dagu performed by Liang Xiaolou: "Dong Cunrui Sacrifices Himself to Blow Up the Bunker"; Danxian performed by Cao Baolu: "Good Couple"; and Fengdiao performed by Wei Xikui: "Li Dacheng Saves the Fire."
