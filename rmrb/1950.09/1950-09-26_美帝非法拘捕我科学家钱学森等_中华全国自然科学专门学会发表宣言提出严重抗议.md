Xinhua News Agency, September 24th:

　　Following the recent incident of American imperialism unreasonably detaining Dr. Qian Xuesen, an expert in aerodynamics, Professor Zhao Zhongyao, an atomic physicist, and two students studying science and engineering, it has aroused great anger in China's scientific community. Li Siguang, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, has sent telegrams to UN General Assembly President Andiren and World Federation of Scientific Workers Secretary Dr. Crowther to accuse American imperialism of trampling on human rights and persecuting scientists. At the same time, he directly telegraphed U.S. President Truman to lodge a strong protest, demanding the immediate release of the detained scientists and guaranteeing that no similar actions will occur in the future. To this end, the Federation issued the following declaration today:

　　The U.S. government has resorted to coercion and enticement to obstruct our professors and students studying in the United States from returning to China, and has recently intensified its efforts. Mechanics expert Professor Qian Xuesen, who was scheduled to return on the "Wilson" ship, was illegally detained by customs officials on August 25 before boarding, acting on the orders of the Federal Court, and his luggage was seized, and the Immigration Bureau ordered that he not be allowed to leave the country. On September 12, when the "Wilson" ship passed Yokohama, Japan, the U.S. occupying army's Eighth Army unreasonably and illegally detained atomic physicist Professor Zhao Zhongyao and two students studying science and engineering, Luo Shijun and Shen Shanjiong, preventing them from returning to their motherland.

　　We express our utmost anger at the U.S. government's actions of destroying scholars, trampling on human rights, and being unreasonable. We lodge a strong protest with the U.S. government, demanding the immediate restoration of their freedom. We will unite with progressive scientists around the world to sanction the war-mongers for this atrocity. Our professors and students in the United States will undoubtedly recognize the hideous face of American imperialism even more clearly because of this, and will resolutely return home as soon as possible to serve the liberated motherland and people, and to fight for the defense of lasting world peace, together with all of China's scientific workers.

　　Li Siguang, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies

　　美帝非法拘捕我科学家钱学森等
    中华全国自然科学专门学会发表宣言提出严重抗议
    【新华社二十四日讯】美国帝国主义近来无理拘捕我国航空力学专家钱学森博士、原子物理学家赵忠尧教授及学习理工的学生二人的事件发生后，已引起我国科学界极大愤怒。中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会主席李四光，已分别致电联合国大会主席安迪让及世界科学工作者协会书记克劳瑟博士控诉美国帝国主义蹂躏人权迫害科学家的罪行，同时并直接电美国总统杜鲁门提出严重抗议，要求立刻释放被捕科学家。并保证今后不得有类似行动。该会为此于今日发表宣言如下：
    美国政府威迫利诱，阻挠我留美教授学生归国，近来更是变本加厉。拟乘“威尔逊”号轮船回国的力学专家钱学森教授于八月二十五日上船前，被海关当局奉联邦法庭命令非法扣留他的行李，并由移民局下令不得出境。九月十二日“威尔逊”号船过日本横滨时，美国驻日本占领军第八军，竟又无理地将原子物理学家赵忠尧教授及学习理工的罗时钧、沈善炯二位学生非法扣押，使其不得回到祖国。
    我们对于美国政府这种摧残学者、蹂躏人权，蛮不讲理的行动，表示无比的愤怒。我们向美国政府提出严重抗议，要求立刻恢复他们的自由。我们将联合全世界进步的科学家来制裁战争贩子的这种暴行。我留美的教授和同学必因此更能认清美帝的狰狞面目，坚决从速回国，和我们全中国的科学工作者在一起，为解放了的祖国和人民而服务，为保卫世界持久和平而奋斗。
      中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会主席李四光
            一九五○年九月二十四日
