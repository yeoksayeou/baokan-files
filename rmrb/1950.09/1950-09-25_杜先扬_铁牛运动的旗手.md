　　Du Xianyang - Standard Bearer of the Iron Ox Movement
　　Chen Ji
　　Editor's Note: Du Xianyang led the Iron Ox locomotive, first "implementing the responsibility system, improving efficiency, reducing costs, and safely completing national transportation tasks," becoming the founder of the new record movement in Northeast Railways, and promoting the Iron Ox movement among 200,000 railway employees in Northeast China.
　　Closely Connected with the Workers
　　Du Xianyang is the deputy director of the transportation department of the Suihua Locomotive Depot, but you can rarely find him in the office. Sometimes he talks to the workers in the locomotive depot; sometimes he climbs under the locomotive to check the locomotive parts. He never puts on airs and cares for the workers everywhere. In the summer nights, the crew members often kick off their blankets when sleeping for comfort. Du Xianyang had been a crew member and knew this habit of the workers. Every night he had to check each dormitory to see if the crew members had covered themselves well. He said to the crew members: catching a cold at night will ruin your health. If you can't drive, how big is the loss! When workers encounter difficulties, they like to ask him for solutions. The new driver, Li Shulin, was not familiar with the operating methods and often made slow-running accidents, and it was even more difficult when he encountered slopes. Lao Du personally taught him how to use the force handle, how to close the steam valve when going uphill, and how to spread sand to avoid idling. With his help, Li Shulin never had another slow-running accident. When the three-shovel system was implemented, some crew members objected: "Using the three-shovel system to burn coal, the train will run out of water and steam when climbing a slope." Du Xianyang set an example by demonstrating it to them. Sure enough, the three-shovel system not only did not cause the locomotive to run out of water and steam, but also saved coal. He led everyone in this way, and everyone loved him. He became the core of unity for railway workers in the Suihua area.
　　Two hundred thousand railway employees involved in the Iron Ox Movement
　　As everyone knows, before the launch of the innovation record movement in Northeast China, there was a new record movement in Northeast Railways - the Iron Ox Movement. The purpose of this movement was to realize the policy of the People's Railway: "Implement the responsibility system, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and safely complete national transportation tasks." The reason why this movement is called "Iron Ox" is because the "Iron Ox" led by Du Xianyang first implemented this policy.
　　The Iron Ox locomotive led by Du Xianyang was declared by the Ministry of Railways last year as one of the national model locomotive banners. Over the past year, it has not only been the banner of model locomotives, but also the locomotive of the Iron Ox Movement. Its vivid and specific model deeds have driven the employees of the entire Northeast Railway to move forward. Under the slogan of learning from the "Iron Ox," workers, technicians, and staff in the locomotive, rolling stock, engineering, electrical, factory, and all kinds of departments of Northeast Railways have been mobilized and enthusiastically and deeply launched the Iron Ox Movement in various ways. A total of 200,000 railway employees in Northeast China have been involved in this movement. More than 10,000 outstanding workers, technicians, and staff have been awarded in this movement, and more than 2,700 production units have been awarded the title of Iron Ox. The "1195" locomotive led by the special-class labor hero Wang Jikui has safely traveled more than 221,600 kilometers, and the locomotive is still in good condition, becoming a well-known backbone Iron Ox locomotive in Northeast China. The Kang Xuefu team of the tool branch of the Huanggu Tun Rolling Stock Factory exceeded its production tasks month after month from April last year to April this year, without any defective products or rework, and also became an Iron Ox team in the factory. The "Masses" train under the leadership of passenger transport banner Li Jinghua has traveled more than 150,000 kilometers in crew operation from February last year to August this year without any passenger transport accidents, becoming an Iron Ox in the rolling stock sector.
　　How did the Iron Ox become an "Iron Ox"?
　　The predecessor of the Iron Ox locomotive was a damaged locomotive. In July 1947, the workers of the Suihua Locomotive Depot celebrated the liberation of Siping and repaired it in their spare time. It was initially called "Siping." At that time, due to the lack of parts, it had to be pieced together. The quality was not high after repair, and accidents often occurred. The crew members felt it was difficult to drive. Du Xianyang, who had just returned from a worker training class, was assigned to be responsible for this locomotive.
　　Du Xianyang - the standard bearer of the Iron Ox Movement, a special-class hero of Northeast Railways, came from a poor family and lost his education in his childhood. He worked on the railway at the age of eighteen and was beaten, insulted, and exploited by the Japanese devils and their lackeys every day for more than ten years. He was upright and did not curry favor with his superiors or give gifts to the lackeys, so he had always been an assistant and could not get on the train. When he returned from the training class, he heard that the superiors wanted him to be the captain of the "Siping" locomotive. He was so excited that he could not speak, and thought to himself: The Communist Party trusts me so much. If I don't put my heart and soul into it, how can I be worthy of it! Although the quality of "Siping" was not good, it was repaired by the workers of the entire section in their spare time with great effort. I must get this locomotive right. With this determination, Du Xianyang quickly accepted the task from his superiors. He started driving this locomotive from August 14, 1947.
　　Under his leadership and example, the workers of this locomotive worked hard to learn from Soviet experience, implement the responsibility system, improve the group system, adopt secret code recording methods, and automatically conduct mutual inspection. In terms of caring for the locomotive, they had a saying: "We must treat it as a patient, take good care of it, and protect its health." When the wiping materials were in short supply, they went to cut grass and soaked it in water to soften the oil stains on the car, making the locomotive look brand new. Before driving, they, especially Du Xianyang, paid great attention to checking the locomotive parts; they often carefully told the factory about the main problems of the locomotive, so that the factory could repair it quickly and with high quality.
　　Unite and transform backward elements
　　To achieve success in contract work, everyone in the contract team must be of one mind in order to create achievements. Du Xianyang said to the active workers in the same car: "Relying on just a few of us will not work. We must unite everyone well." Wu Guangshen had a bad temper and spoke nonsense. Other locomotive workers hated him and were unwilling to work with him, saying that he was "extremely backward." Since he was transferred to Du Xianyang's locomotive, Lao Du tried to transform him. Wu Guangshen had been an inspector, with high skills and experience. Lao Du often praised him for these advantages in his work, but also often advised him: "If a person is strong but has a bad temper and is divorced from the masses, it will not work. You have to change!" After Lao Du's continuous encouragement, criticism and help, Wu Guangshen said with emotion to others: "Lao Du is so good to me. If I don't change, I'm really too backward!" Later, Wu Guangshen really changed and became a model driver. Lao Du turned backward elements into active elements, making the workers of the entire locomotive as united as a family. Due to their hard work, the condition of the locomotive quickly improved.
　　Heroic deeds of the Iron Ox
　　In 1948, Northeast Railways learned from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and created a new driving method to shorten the turnover rate. At that time, some people had no confidence, but Du Xianyang's locomotive was the first to respond and take the lead in implementing it. On December 15, 1948, he took train 237 from Suihua to Nancha, and the technical speed reached a new record of 40 kilometers. At the same time, he took the initiative to contact the dispatch and station during the parking time, saving shunting time. At that time, the general locomotives were only able to travel 35,000 kilometers due to poor maintenance and low quality, and they needed to be inspected once; however, Du Xianyang's locomotive traveled 106,901 kilometers before being inspected once, which greatly improved the quality and operational efficiency of the locomotive, reducing the repair cost by more than 150 million yuan for the country, and also increased the freight revenue by more than 90 million yuan. In terms of "safe transportation," they also played a model role, safely traveling more than 100,000 kilometers. This series of initiatives gave the Northeast Railway a new force at that time.
　　Due to their creation of such brilliant achievements, their locomotive was personally named "Iron Ox" by Zhuang Lin, director of the Harbin Railway Administration, in February 1949. This "Iron Ox" has always maintained its honor. From the day Du Xianyang contracted it to today, nearly three years, it has not had a single accident. At the end of last year, freight trains on the Ha-Chang line often experienced slow-running accidents, which affected train delays and caused serious congestion at Harbin Station. At that time, the crew members believed that slow-running was inevitable due to the cold weather and long slopes. More than 30 locomotives in the Harbin Locomotive Depot could not avoid slow-running accidents. This would affect the national transportation tasks. The Harbin Railway Bureau specially requested instructions from the Northeast Railway Administration to transfer the "Iron Ox" from Suihua to Harbin. When the "Iron Ox" arrived in Harbin, it hauled 1,800 tons on its first duty, departing from Harbin on time. Between Caijiagou and Qiujia, where the slopes were long and prone to slow-running, not only did it not slow down, but it also grabbed 10 minutes, arriving at Taolaizhao 5 minutes early, using only more than 8,200 kilograms of coal. At that time, the general locomotives in this section hauled 1,600 tons and had to use more than 9,700 kilograms of coal. This vivid model behavior of the "Iron Ox" effectively promoted the crew work in Harbin, enabling the Harbin Locomotive Depot to launch a production competition movement to haul more trains and avoid slow-running accidents, and complete the transportation tasks.
　　Humbly learn and promote experience
　　Du Xianyang took the lead in doing a good job with the "Iron Ox." He honorably joined the Party on January 27 last year, was promoted to directing driver in March, and was awarded the title of special-class labor hero of Northeast Railways. After the Iron Ox Movement was launched, he became the captain of the Iron Ox Brigade of the Harbin Railway Administration. On December 3 last year, he was promoted to deputy director of operations of the Suihua Locomotive Depot.
　　Because he constantly worked hard to learn, improve his skills, promote experience, and lead by example, he was once again honorably awarded the title of special-class labor hero of Northeast Railways at the Second Northeast Railway Labor Model Conference this year; in July this year, he was also honorably invited to Beijing to participate in the National Committee Meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Lao Du returned to Suihua from Beijing and said to the workers: "I attended meetings in Beijing for more than ten days, and saw Chairman Mao every day. I also took a photo with Chairman Mao. I was so happy that I couldn't speak. We are workers and have received such high honor, but I only feel ashamed that my work is not good enough." Honor did not make him complacent, but instead made him more humble: "We must work hard to learn, learn culture, learn technology, and learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience."
　　"If the work in that section is not done well, it means that the labor heroes in that section are not playing their role!" Lao Du understood this. Every time he came back from a meeting outside, he always thought about how to play a leading role, do a good job, and how to make the Iron Ox Movement develop more deeply. Recently, under the leadership of Lao Du, the workers in the Suihua area have created brilliant achievements again: of the 39 locomotives in the Suihua Locomotive Depot, 19 are backbone Iron Oxes, 15 are official Iron Oxes, 3 are reserve Iron Oxes, and 2 are not in use. Almost 100% of the locomotives in the entire section are Iron Oxes; the operations department has not had any liability accidents in 184 days, traveling more than 1.45 million safe kilometers. By the end of August this year, 4 locomotives have exceeded 200,000 safe kilometers. These great achievements are inseparable from Du Xianyang's leadership, example, and guidance.
　　This time, Du Xianyang was also honorably elected as a representative to the National Conference of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. When I asked him in Harbin about his thoughts on participating in this conference, he said: "Our workers, peasants, and soldiers must unite, work hard in production, and defend the motherland!"

　　杜先扬——铁牛运动的旗手
    陈迹
    编者按：杜先扬领导铁牛号机车，首先“贯彻负责制，提高效率，减低成本，安全完成国家运输任务”，成了东北铁路新纪录运动的创始者，推动东北二十万铁路员工卷入了铁牛运动。
    和工人群众密切联系
    杜先扬是绥化机务段运转部门副主任，但你在办公室内常常见不着他，有时他在机车库里找工人们谈话；有时爬在机车底下检查机车零件。他从来不摆架子，处处关心工人。在夏天的夜里，乘务员睡觉贪舒适，常把被子扔掉。杜先扬当过乘务员，知道工人这种习惯，每晚他总得到各宿舍检查一下乘务员盖好被子没有。他对乘务员说：晚上受凉，身体垮了，开不了车，损失多大！工人们碰到什么困难，最喜欢找他解决。新司机李树林不熟悉操纵法，常犯运缓事故，碰见坡道更作难，老杜就亲自教他怎样使用力把，上坡时怎样关汽门，撒砂子，避免空转。经过他帮助，李树林再也没出运缓事故了。实行三锹制时，有些乘务员反对：“用三锹制焚火，车上坡就没水没汽。”杜先扬以身作则示范给他们看，果然三锹制不仅不会使机车没水没汽，而且能省煤。他这样地领导大家，大家无不爱戴他，他成了绥化地区铁路工人团结的核心。
    二十万铁路员工卷入铁牛运动
    大家都知道，在东北开展创新纪录运动之前，东北铁路就有一种新纪录运动——铁牛运动。这个运动的目的是为了实现人民铁路的方针：“贯彻负责制，提高效率，减低成本，安全完成国家运输任务。”这个运动之所以叫做“铁牛”，就是因为杜先扬领导的“铁牛号”首先贯彻实现了这个方针。
    杜先扬领导的铁牛号机车曾在去年被铁道部宣布为全国模范机车旗帜之一。一年来，它不仅是模范机车的旗帜，而且是铁牛运动的火车头，它的活生生的具体的模范事迹，带动着全东北铁路员工们前进。在向“铁牛号”看齐的响亮口号下，东北铁路的机务、车务、工务、电务、工厂和所有各种部门的工人、技术人员、职员都动员起来了，都以各种各样的方法热烈地深入地展开了铁牛运动。全东北已有二十万铁路员工卷入了这一运动，在这一运动中荣获奖励的有一万多名优秀的工人、技术人员和职员，荣膺铁牛称号的生产单位有两千七百多个。特等劳动英雄王吉魁领导的“一一九五号”机车，安全走行二十二万一千六百多公里，机车仍保持良好状态，成了东北有名的基干铁牛机车。皇姑屯车辆工厂工具分厂的康学福小组，从去年四月到今年四月，月月超过生产任务，没有一件废品和反工活，也成了工厂中的铁牛小组。在客运旗帜李静华领导下的“群众号”列车，从去年二月到今年八月，乘务运行十五万多公里，从未发生客运事故，成了车务方面的铁牛。
    铁牛号是怎样变成“铁牛”的
    铁牛号机车的前身，是一辆破损了的机车。一九四七年七月，绥化机务段的工友们，庆祝四平解放，利用业余时间，把它修复了，起初叫“四平号”。当时因零件缺乏，要东拼西凑，修成后质量不高，经常出事故，乘务员都觉得难驾驶，刚从工人轮训班学习回来的杜先扬，被分配来负责这部机车。
    杜先扬——铁牛运动的旗手，东北铁路的特等英雄，家境贫苦，幼年失学，十八岁上铁路作工，干了十几年，天天受着日本鬼子及其狗腿子的毒打、侮辱和剥削。他为人正直，不向上巴结，不给狗腿子们送礼，所以一直做着助手工作，不能上车。他从轮训班学习回来，听说上级要他担任“四平号”机车司机长，他激动得说不出话来，心里想：共产党这样信任咱，咱再不把心掏出来干，怎对得起啦！虽然“四平号”的质量不好，可是是全段工友们在业余时间费挺大心力修好的呀。咱一定得把这台机车搞好。杜先扬抱着这个决心，很快地接受了上级的任务。从一九四七年八月十四日起，开始包乘这台机车。
    这台机车的工友在他的领导和带头下，努力学习苏联经验，贯彻负责制，健全小组制度，采用暗号纪录法，自动互相检查工作。在爱护机车上，他们自己有句话：“咱们要把它当个病人看，好好调养它，保护它的健康。”擦车的材料困难，他们就自己去割草，用水泡软擦车上的油垢，使机车焕然一新。在开车前，他们，特别是杜先扬极注意检点机车零件；经常把机车的主要毛病，仔细地告诉工厂，这样工厂修理得快，质量又高。
    团结改造落后分子
    要想包车有成绩，包车组每个人都要一条心，才能创造出成绩来。杜先扬对同车的积极工友说：“光靠咱这几个人不行，一定得好好团结大家。”邬广绅脾气坏乱说话，别的机车工友讨厌他，不愿跟他一起工作，说他“顶落后”。自从他调到杜先扬的机车上，老杜就想法改造他。邬广绅当过检点员，技术高，经验多，老杜常常在工作中表扬他这些优点，但也常常劝他：“人强性子太坏，脱离群众，是不行的，你得改呀！”经过老杜不断的鼓励、批评和帮助，邬广绅感动的对人说：“老杜这样对我好，我再不改，真太落后啦！”后来邬广绅真的转变了，成了模范司机长。老杜把落后分子变成积极分子，使得整个机车的工友团结像一家人。由于他们的艰苦奋斗，机车状况很快的好起来。
    铁牛号的英雄事迹
    一九四八年东北铁路学习苏联先进经验，创行新行车法，以缩短周转率。当时有些人没有信心，杜先扬的机车却首先响应，带头实行。一九四八年十二月十五日，他乘二三七次列车从绥化开往南叉，技术速度达到了四十公里的新纪录。同时利用停车时间主动向调度、车站联系，节省了调车时间。当时一般机车都因保养不好，质量低下，只能走行三万五千公里，就需要作一次甲检；但杜先扬的机车却走行十万六千九百零一公里，才甲检一次，使得机车质量和运用效率大大提高，替国家减少了一亿五千多万元的检修成本费，还多收入了九千多万元的运费。在“安全运输”方面，他们也起了模范作用，安全走行了十万多公里。这一连串的创举，给了当时东北铁路以一种新的力量。
    由于他们创造这样辉煌的成绩，他们的机车在一九四九年二月由哈尔滨铁路管理局局长庄林亲自命名为“铁牛号”。这个“铁牛号”一直保持着它的荣誉。从杜先扬包乘的那天起，到今天将近三年的时间，它没有出过一次事故。去年年底哈长线的货物列车经常发生运缓事故，影响列车晚点，造成哈尔滨站严重的堵塞现象。当时乘务员认为天气冷、坡道长，运缓是必然的事。哈尔滨机务段三十多台机车都没法避免运缓事故。这将影响国家运输任务。哈尔滨铁路局特请示东北铁路总局，要求把“铁牛号”由绥化调到哈尔滨。“铁牛号”到了哈尔滨，第一次出勤就牵引一千八百吨，从哈尔滨正点开出，在坡道长，易于运缓的蔡家沟与邱家之间，不但没运缓，还抢点十分钟，早五分钟到陶赖昭，只用煤八千二百多公斤。当时一般机车在这段区间牵引一千六百吨，还得用煤九千七百多公斤。“铁牛号”这种生动的模范行为，有力的推动了哈尔滨的乘务工作，使哈尔滨机务段展开了多拉车、不出运缓事故的生产竞赛运动，完成了运输任务。
    虚心学习，推广经验
    杜先扬带头搞好“铁牛号”，去年一月二十七日光荣入党，三月被提升为指导司机，荣膺东北铁路的特等劳动英雄。铁牛运动展开后，他就做了哈尔滨铁路管理局的铁牛大队长。去年十二月三日又被提升为绥化机务段的运转副主任。
    因为他不断地努力学习，提高技术，推广经验，带头示范，所以在今年东北铁路第二届劳模大会上，他再度光荣连膺东北铁路特等劳动英雄；今年七月又荣誉地被邀请到北京，参加中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会议。老杜从北京回到绥化，向工人们说：“咱在北京开会十几天，天天见到毛主席，还跟毛主席一起照像，真是高兴得说不出话来。咱是工人，得到了这样高的荣誉，只惭愧自己工作做得不够。”荣誉没有使他自满，反而更虚心了：“咱得努力学习，学习文化，学习技术，学习苏联先进经验。”
    “那一段的工作没搞好，就是那一段的劳动英雄没起作用！”老杜懂得这一点，每次从外面开会回来，心里总盘算着怎样起带头作用，把工作做好，怎样使铁牛运动更深入发展下去。最近绥化地区的工人们在老杜的带动下，又创造了辉煌成绩：绥化机务段三十九台机车中有十九台是基干铁牛，十五台是正式铁牛，三台是预备铁牛，还有两台没使用，全段机车几乎百分之百是铁牛了；运转部门在一百八十四天中，没出任何责任事故，走行一百四十五万多安全公里。今年八月底已有四台机车超过二十万安全公里。这些伟大成就是和杜先扬的带头、示范和领导分不开的。
    这次杜先扬又光荣当选为全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议代表。当我在哈尔滨问他参加这个大会的感想时，他说：“咱们工农兵要团结起来，努力生产，保卫祖国！”
          一九五○、九、二○于沈阳
