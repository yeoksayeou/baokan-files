　　Xiahuayuan Baoxing Coal Mine Gas Explosion Incident
    Negligent Personnel Punished According to National Law
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Regarding the gas explosion incident at the Xiahuayuan Baoxing Coal Mine in Chahar Province, the handling measures proposed by the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government's Administrative Council have been approved by the Administrative Council, and the personnel responsible for the dereliction of duty have been punished. The No. 9 ventilation outlet in the excavation area of the fourth team of the second pit (joint state-private enterprise) of the Xiahuayuan Baoxing Coal Mine, occurred a gas explosion at 10:20 on June 3rd, resulting in 11 worker casualties (5 deaths, 6 injuries). After the incident, the Chahar Provincial Government immediately dispatched three cadres from the Industry Department and the Labor Bureau to investigate and assist the mine in handling the aftermath. The families of the deceased have been compensated, and the injured have mostly recovered after treatment. The Xuanhua Municipal Government, the Public Security Bureau, and local government agencies in the mining area sent personnel to form an accident investigation team to conduct an in-depth investigation underground, determining that the incident was a preventable but unprevented responsibility accident.
    The second pit of the mine mainly relied on natural ventilation, supplemented by two 4-horsepower ventilators, but they could only supply partial airflow. Ventilation was better in autumn and winter. Since the beginning of summer, due to climate change, coupled with the impact of fractured tunnels and fire areas above the Tenth Lane, ventilation weakened, and methane accumulated as a result. Four days before the accident, blue sparks were discovered during blasting in the ventilation roadway. Although precautions were taken, and excavation and blasting were stopped, and the ventilation ducts were cleaned up, the airflow did not increase. The mine leadership underestimated the possibility of a gas explosion, had serious paralysis and wishful thinking, and did not actively seek to improve ventilation conditions and equipment technically. After the incident, cigarettes, tobacco pouches, and other items were found on the bodies of the four deceased. Team leader Liu Yin (slightly injured) also had two cigarettes. This shows that although the mine had issued a notice banning smoking and open flames, and stipulated penalties, because of insufficient understanding of the smoking and open flame ban, the implementation of pit entrance inspection system was considered distrustful and insulting to the workers, the implementation of the system was careless, and there was no more specific organization and inspection. As a result, the airflow could not be increased, and the smoking and open flames could not be eliminated, and ultimately the explosion was caused by workers smoking in the ventilation tunnel where gas had accumulated, which is worthy of vigilance in the future.
    The People's Supervision Committee of the Administrative Council, based on the report of the Chahar Provincial People's Government, formulated handling measures, which have been approved by the Administrative Council, and ordered the Chahar Province to implement: Manager Gao Shudong, since liberation, although he has made many improvements in the management of the mine, and his work attitude is good, he has a serious fluke paralysis mentality regarding safety work, and has not taken a serious and responsible attitude to improve ventilation and strictly prohibit smoking and open flames. He should bear the main responsibility for this accident, and be given the punishment of dismissal. Mining Engineer Wang Zimei, has made great contributions to the mine. Before this accident, he was instructed by the manager to participate in the inventory and census work; but since he did not leave the mine, and knew that the ventilation was insufficient in the summer, he did not pay attention to research and timely improvement, and was responsible for the lack of technical guidance, and a minor demerit should be recorded. Pit Leader Li Dehou, usually does not pay attention to inspection. After knowing the signs of an explosion, he did not take effective measures in time, nor did he report to the manager or mining engineer, but only gave verbal instructions, showing a serious bureaucratic style, and should bear direct major responsibility, and be given the punishment of dismissal and handed over to judicial organs for handling according to law. Coal Technicians Liu Mingchang and Security Guard Wang Ju, who are responsible for security production, did not take alarm when they found thick methane, nor did they report it, showing a lack of organization and discipline and a lack of attention to safe production, and each should receive two major demerits. Team leader Liu Yin, not only did not prevent others from bringing cigarettes, but also brought his own cigarettes, violating the discipline of prohibiting bringing cigarettes and open flames, and being in violation of his duties, should be expelled.

### 下花园宝兴煤矿瓦斯爆炸事件  失职人员受到国家法律处分

　　下花园宝兴煤矿瓦斯爆炸事件
    失职人员受到国家法律处分
    【本报讯】察哈尔省下花园宝兴煤矿瓦斯爆炸事件，由中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会提出处理办法，经政务院批准后，已予失职人员以处分。下花园宝兴煤矿公（私合营）二坑坑下四组掘进区第九通风口，于六月三日十时二十分发生瓦斯爆炸事件，死伤工人十一名（死五人，伤六人）。事件发生后，察哈尔省府即派工业厅、劳动局三名干部前往检查，并协助该矿办理善后事宜。死者家属已予抚恤，伤者经过治疗，已大部痊愈。宣化市府、公安局及矿区当地政府等机关事后曾派员组成事故检查组，深入坑下进行检查，判明此次事件为可以避免而未能避免的责任事故。
    该矿二坑，向以自然通风为主，另以四马力通风机两台辅助通风，然仅能供给局部风量。秋冬两季通风较好。入夏以来，气候变化，加之坑道破碎及十道巷以上火区的影响，通风减弱，沼气因之存积。出事四天前，在风巷放炮时，曾发现蓝火花，虽已开始戒备，先后停止掘进和放炮，并对风道曾加以整理，但风量并未增加。该矿领导上对瓦斯爆炸的可能性，估计不足，存在严重的麻痹和希图侥幸心理，在技术上亦未积极设法改善通风条件和设备。事后在死者四人身上，均发现带有纸烟、烟袋等物。组长刘银（轻伤）亦带有纸烟两支。由此说明该矿虽曾发布过禁烟禁火的布告，规定过罚则，但因为对禁烟禁火认识不足，以为实行坑口检查制度就是对工人的不相信和侮辱，执行制度粗心大意，没有较具体的组织和检查。以致风量未能增加，烟火未能禁绝，终因工人在风道内瓦斯堆积处吸烟引起爆炸，这是值得今后警惕的。
    政务院人民监察委员会根据察哈尔省人民政府报告，拟定处理办法，已经政务院批准，饬令察省执行：经理高树栋，在解放以来，对该矿经营上虽有许多改进，工作态度尚好，但对保安工作存在着严重的侥幸麻痹心理，未以认真负责的态度，改善通风，严禁烟火，对此次事故应负主要责任，给予撤职处分。矿师王子美，对该矿贡献很大，此次事故前又受经理指示，参加清点普查工作；但既未离开该矿，且明知夏季通风不足，却未注意研究，及时改善，有失技术指导责任，记小过一次。坑长李德厚，平时不注意检查，知道爆炸征象情况后，既未及时作有效措施，亦未向经理、矿师报告，只作口头嘱咐，表现着严重的官僚主义作风，应负直接的重大责任，予以撤职处分并送司法机关法办。煤师柳明昌、保安员王巨，负保安生产责任，发现沼气浓厚，未加警惕，也没做报告，表现无组织无纪律不重视安全生产，各记大过两次。组长刘银，不但未阻止他人带烟，且自带纸烟，破坏禁带烟火纪律，有背职责，应予开除。
