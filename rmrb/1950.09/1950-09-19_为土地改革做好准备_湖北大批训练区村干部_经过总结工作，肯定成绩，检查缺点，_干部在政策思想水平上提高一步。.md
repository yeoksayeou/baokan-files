　　Preparing for Land Reform
    Hubei Trains a Large Number of District and Village Cadres
    Through summarizing work, affirming achievements, and examining shortcomings, cadres have improved their policy and ideological understanding.
    [Our Dispatch] Since late June, Hubei Province has been conducting large-scale training of district and village cadres by summarizing and inspecting work. By the end of July, the cadre training classes held by various prefectural and county committees had completed one or two sessions, training more than 2,100 district-level cadres and 16,000 to 17,000 village cadres.
    Before drawing village cadres for training, various regions generally conducted ideological mobilization, and the trainees were highly motivated. However, in the early stages of learning, there were many ideological problems. For example, intellectual cadres wanted to learn theory, worker and peasant cadres wanted to learn culture, some believed that they had made mistakes in the past and were here to be punished, some thought they would be promoted after learning, others wanted to take the opportunity to rest, and some village cadres were afraid of delaying production. When the learning plan was announced, proposing to summarize work, examine work, and carry out learning using the method of rectification, cadres generally had resistance in their thinking, believing that they were here to learn about land reform, beating and tying people was for work, and they were small cadres with no bureaucracy or commandism to rectify. In response to the above ideological situation of the trainees, leaders at all levels made various enlightenment reports, clarifying the purpose of rectification and that summarizing and examining work was precisely for correctly carrying out land reform. This initially stabilized the trainees' learning mood.
    When learning officially entered the stage of summarizing and examining work, the trainees developed new ideological concerns, mainly fearing that they would offend their superiors in the process of summarizing and examining work, suffer retaliation upon returning, and not be promoted; fearing that after examining their own mistakes, they would lose face and be punished. After the responsible comrades' enlightening reports, taking the lead in self-examination, and the leadership expressing its attitude of focusing on the matter and not the person, these concerns were quickly dispelled.
    When summarizing and examining work, achievements were first affirmed, so that everyone was encouraged and comforted spiritually. Then, further enlightenment was given to everyone to examine the work of their village using the method of accounting and comparison. For example, accounting for rent reduction, whether the rent reduction was thorough or not? How much has been reduced? How much is left to be reduced? Comparing strength, have the masses been mobilized? Have the local bullies been overthrown? Is the strength of the masses great? Or is the feudal force great? Comparing work style, is coercion and command good? Or is it better to persuade and educate the masses? After everyone discussed and analyzed, and carried out mass criticism and self-criticism, the results were summarized experiences and examined shortcomings in the work.
    This approach of starting from summarizing work, affirming achievements, examining shortcomings, and studying improvement methods has achieved good results. In this rectification study, village cadres in various regions generally clarified the following issues: (1) From the process of summarizing and examining work, they realized that coercion and command not only cannot complete the task, but also arouse the resentment of the masses, giving hidden enemies an opportunity to take advantage of. The comparison method during work inspection, from good examples, the trainees realized that the working method of the mass line of consulting with the masses on everything is the key to doing a good job. (2) We must act in accordance with policies. During the inspection of work in many areas, violations of policies such as infringement on middle peasants were discovered. This is because some cadres have the erroneous idea of "rather be 'left' than right." For example, in times of famine, some cadres forcibly "borrowed grain" from middle peasants, causing widespread anxiety among middle peasants and greatly affecting the work. The trainees reviewed and said: "I didn't understand what policy was before, but I must act in accordance with policy in the future." (3) Stand firm and serve the people honestly. In the inspection, many trainees exposed their mistakes such as accepting gifts from landlords and embezzlement and corruption.

　　为土地改革做好准备
    湖北大批训练区村干部
    经过总结工作，肯定成绩，检查缺点，干部在政策思想水平上提高一步。
    【本报讯】湖北省自六月下旬开始，各地先后通过总结工作、检查工作，大规模训练区村级干部。至七月底止，各地委、县委所举办的干部训练班已完成一期或两期，已训练区级干部二千一百多人，乡村干部一万六、七千人。
    这次各地在抽调乡村干部训练之前，一般都经过了思想动员，学员情绪很高。但是在学习初期，在思想上是存在不少问题的。如知识分子干部想来学理论，工农干部想来学文化，有的认为过去自己犯了错误，这次是来受处分，有的认为学习以后就要提拔，也有的想借学习机会休息休息，有些村干部则怕耽误生产。当宣布学习计划提出总结工作、检查工作，以整风方法来进行学习时，干部思想上普遍都有抵触，认为自己是来学习土改，打人捆人是为了工作，自己是小干部没有什么官僚主义、命令主义可整。针对学员的上述思想情况，各地领导上作了各种启发报告，讲清了整风的目的，和总结、检查工作正是为了正确地进行土地改革。这样使学员的学习情绪初步安定下来。
    在学习开始正式进入总结检查工作阶段时，学员又产生了新的思想顾虑，主要是怕在总结、检查工作中得罪了上级，回去遭受报复，不被提拔；怕检查出自己的错误之后，丢面子，受处分。经过负责同志的启发报告，带头检查，领导上表明态度，对事不对人，这些顾虑便很快得到解除。
    在总结检查工作时，首先肯定成绩，使大家在精神上得到鼓励与安慰。然后就进一步用算账和对比的办法启发大家检查本村的工作。例如算减租，减租彻底不彻底？已经减了多少？还有多少没有减？比力量，群众发动起来了没有？恶霸打倒了没有？群众力量大？还是封建势力大？比作风，强迫命令好？还是说服教育群众好？经过大家讨论分析，和展开群众性的批评与自我批评，结果总结了经验，也检查了工作中的缺点。
    这种从总结工作开始，肯定成绩，检查缺点，研究改进办法的作法，收到了良好效果。在这次整风学习中，各地区村干部一般都明确了如下几个问题：（一）从总结检查工作过程中，认识了强迫命令不但不能完成任务，而且惹起群众的反感，使暗藏的敌人有机可乘。检查工作时的对比方法，从好的事例中，学员们认识了有事和群众商量的群众路线的工作方式，是做好工作的关键。（二）一定要按政策办事。不少地区在检查工作时，发现了违犯政策如侵犯中农的现象。这是因为某些干部存在“宁‘左’勿右”的错误思想所致。如在度荒中，有些干部强向中农“借粮”，引起中农普遍不安，对工作影响很大。学员检讨说：“以前不懂什么叫政策，今后可要按政策办事。”（三）站稳立场，老老实实为人民服务。在检查中，不少学员暴露了自己曾接受地主礼物，贪污腐化等错误。
