Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: The undergraduate departments of the new-style university of New China, Renmin University of China, officially began classes on September 1st. With the active assistance of Soviet experts and professors, the educational plans for each department, from the first semester to the last, were all formulated during the summer vacation.

The university's undergraduate departments originally included Economics, Economic Planning, Finance, Trade, Cooperation, Law, Diplomacy, and Factory Management. The Economics Department has now been merged into the Economic Planning Department, and the original Russian Language Training Class has been changed to the undergraduate Russian Language Department. The duration of study for all undergraduate departments, except for Law and Diplomacy (four years), is uniformly three years, calculated from this semester.

The university originally had six teaching and research sections, which have now been increased to over thirty. Each teaching and research section and each teacher has a detailed work plan. Teachers are not only required to do a good job in teaching, but also in research. Under the university's Research Department, a Scientific Research Division and a Postgraduate Division have been specially established to lead scientific research and the education of postgraduates. All staff members are required to participate in teaching and research sections or select courses in various departments for study.

All of the dozens of Soviet professors employed by the university have arrived. After arriving, they immediately began writing teaching materials, formulating teaching plans, and assisting Chinese teachers in conducting scientific research with great enthusiasm. Their work attitude has been warmly loved by all students and Chinese teachers. For the courses taught by Soviet professors, they mostly write the teaching materials first, translate them into Chinese, and then help Chinese teachers study them in detail in the teaching and research sections, before the Chinese teachers teach the students in the classroom.

In order to better connect students' learning with practice, the university also invites heads and experts from relevant government departments to give lectures or reports for many courses.

At the university-wide faculty and student meeting before the start of this semester's courses, President Wu Yuzhang proposed raising China's level of Marxism-Leninism theory and modern science and technology as the task of all faculty and students, and pointed out that consciously abiding by the study plan and study system should become a characteristic of the learning life at Renmin University of China.

In addition, the university's Special Training Courses have recruited students in various places for eleven classes, including Cooperatives, Statistics, Domestic Trade, Foreign Trade, Planned Economy, Finance, Factory Management, History and Geography, Education, Law, and Diplomacy. It is expected that classes will begin on October 2nd. A total of 1,200 students will be enrolled in the Special Training Courses this term, with a study period of eight months.

    教学研究室增加到三十多个
    【新华社六日讯】新中国的新型高等学校中国人民大学本科各系，已于九月一日正式开始上课。各系由第一学期到最后一个学期的教育计划，也在苏联专家、教授的积极帮助下于暑假期中全部制定。
    该校本科原有经济、经济计划、财政、贸易、合作、法律、外交、工厂管理等系，现将经济系并入经济计划系，并将原俄文专修班改为本科俄文系。本科各系修业年限除法律、外交两系为四年外，其余一律为三年，都自本学期起计算。
    该校原有教学研究室六个，现已增加为三十多个。每个教学研究室和每个教员都有详细的工作计划。教员不仅要作好教学工作，而且要作好研究工作。在学校的研究部之下，专设了科学研究处和研究生处，领导科学研究工作与对研究生的教育工作。全校在职干部都要分别参加教学研究室或在各系选课，进行学习。
    该校所聘数十名苏联教授已全部到校。他们到校后都立即以极大的热情开始编写讲义、制订教学计划并帮助我国教员进行科学研究。他们的工作态度受到全校学生和中国教员的热烈爱戴。苏联教授所担任的课程，大部分是先写出讲义，译成中文，然后在教学研究室内帮助我国教员详细研究，再由我国教员到课堂给学生上课。
    为了使学生的学习更好地联系实际，该校并有许多课程是要聘请政府各有关业务部门的首长、专家等来担任讲授或报告的。
    在本学期课程开始前的全校师生大会上，吴玉章校长提出了提高中国的马列主义理论水平和近代科学技术水平作为全校师生的任务，并指出自觉地遵守学习计划和学习制度应成为中国人民大学学习生活的特点。
