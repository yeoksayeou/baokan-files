　　*World Knowledge* Editorial: The Chinese People's Indictment
Points out that Our Indictment of the American Aggressors Being Placed on the Security Council Agenda is a Victory for Peace-Loving People Worldwide
Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: The *World Knowledge* weekly magazine published here on September 9th published an editorial entitled "The Chinese People's Indictment," commenting on the two agenda items to be discussed in the Security Council, the armed aggression against Taiwan case and the air force bombing of Chinese territory case. The editorial first pointed out that: Due to the outstanding and just struggle waged by Soviet representative Malik in the Security Council, "Our indictment against the American interventionists and aggressors has finally been placed on the agenda of the Security Council. This is a victory for justice, a victory for the Chinese people, and a victory for peace-loving people all over the world."

The editorial then pointed out: The United States introduced a "question" of the "future status of Taiwan," which does not actually exist, in the Security Council. They want to use this "question" to cover up a real question: the American armed occupation of Taiwan. We should emphatically point out that in the upcoming discussions in the Security Council, it is the issue of the American armed occupation of Taiwan, not the "question" of the "future status of Taiwan."

The editorial further exposed that the purpose of the American Air Force bombing our territory was to create excuses for aggression and expand the war of aggression, and solemnly stated: "The Chinese people cannot tolerate this aggression, and the Chinese people have never bowed their heads in the face of aggressors. If the American armed forces attempt to prevent our People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan, we are determined to drive the aggressors into the sea. The American aggressors' air force that imagines it can run rampant in any region of China will be met with due punishment."

The editorial declared: The Chinese people fully support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal to sanction the American aircraft bombing our territory and order the American government to completely withdraw its aggressive troops in Korea. "The American aggressive activities in Korea, Taiwan, and Northeast China have undermined world peace. The urgent task for the Chinese people and the Asian people at present is to mobilize all forces to drive away the American imperialist aggressors."

The editorial finally pointed out: Our people's representatives have not yet attended the Security Council and the upcoming Fifth United Nations General Assembly, therefore we especially thank the Soviet representative for his just struggle against the aggressors in the Security Council. We, the Chinese people, will enthusiastically support the Soviet representative's persistent struggle.

　　《世界知识》社评中国人民的控诉
    指出我们对美国侵略者的控诉  列入安理会议程是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利
    【新华社十日讯】九月九日在此间出版的《世界知识》周刊以《中国人民的控诉》为题，发表社评，评论即将在安全理事会讨论的武装侵略台湾案和空军轰炸中国领土案两项议程。社评首先指出：由于苏联代表马立克在安理会内进行的卓越的和正义的斗争，“我们对美国干涉者和侵略者的控诉，终于列入了安全理事会的议程，这是正义的胜利，是中国人民的胜利，也是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利”。
    社评接着指出：美国在安理会中搬出一个实际并不存在的“台湾的未来地位”“问题”，他们想用这个“问题”遮住一个真正的问题：美国武装侵占台湾。我们应该强调地指出：在安全理事会即将举行的讨论中，是一个美国武装侵占台湾的问题，而不是什么“台湾的未来地位”“问题”。
    社评在进而揭露美国空军轰炸我国领土的目的在制造侵略借口，扩大侵略战争后，严正表示：“中国人民不能忍受这种侵略，中国人民一向没有在侵略者面前低头。美国的武装部队企图拦阻我人民解放军解放台湾，我们就有决心把侵略者赶到海里去。美国侵略者的空军妄想在中国任何地区横行无忌，都要遭到应有的惩罚。
    社评宣称：中国人民完全拥护周恩来外长要求制裁美国飞机轰炸我国领土及命令美国政府完全撤退其在朝鲜的侵略军队的建议。“美国在朝鲜、台湾和我国东北的侵略活动，已经破坏了世界和平。中国人民和亚洲人民目前的紧急任务是动员一切力量赶走美帝国主义侵略者”。
    社评最后指出：我国人民的代表还没有出席安理会和即将举行的第五届联合国大会，因此我们特别感谢苏联代表在安全理事会中反对侵略者的正义斗争。我们中国人民必将热烈支持苏联代表坚持不懈的斗争。
