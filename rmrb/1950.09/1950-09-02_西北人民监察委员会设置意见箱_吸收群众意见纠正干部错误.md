(Report from this newspaper) The Northwest People's Supervision Committee set up suggestion boxes to absorb public opinion and correct cadre mistakes.
[This newspaper reported from Xi'an] According to the Xi'an Masses Daily, in order to implement the mass line in supervision work and collect more public opinions, the Northwest Military and Political Committee's People's Supervision Committee set up six public suggestion boxes in the east, south, west, and north gates of Xi'an City, as well as at the Bell Tower and the railway station in late April. In the past three months, a total of 73 suggestions have been received, most of which have been promptly handled, and the results have been communicated to the original suggesters, initially laying the foundation for a direct connection between supervision work and the broad masses.
    Among these 73 suggestions, 21 cases involved accusations of cadres' illegal and derelict behavior, as well as extravagance and waste; 3 cases involved disagreements with court judgments and requests for re-examination; 18 cases involved accusations of local bullies and secret agents engaging in sabotage and fraud against the masses; 19 cases involved suggestions and inquiries to the government; 3 cases involved requests for employment and divorce; 2 cases involved requests for handling housing and debt disputes; and 7 cases involved accusations of the masses using drugs and violating social order. About 67 percent of the suggesters did not provide their names. The Northwest People's Supervision Committee attaches great importance to these suggestions, handling some directly and forwarding others to lower-level supervision committees for investigation and reporting. Those that do not fall within the scope of the People's Supervision Committee's work are referred to relevant competent authorities for handling. The vast majority of cases transferred by the Supervision Committee to relevant agencies for handling have received timely responses. For example, a person from Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, reported that Wang Shuwu, a staff member of the county's telecommunications bureau, had a bureaucratic work style. The Supervision Committee sent a letter to the Shaanxi Provincial Supervision Committee for investigation and handling. The Shaanxi Provincial Supervision Committee received a report from the Liquan County Telecommunications Bureau, detailing Wang Shuwu's poor performance, which had been preliminarily examined during the rectification campaign and would continue to be deeply reflected upon. In another instance, Yang Guoan, Yang Shangqian, and four others from Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, accused Yang Guodong, the director of the fourth township farmers' association in Caobao District of the county, and Li Hanchen, the administrative director, of embezzlement. Shi Letian and Yan Xuekong, two members of the Shaanxi Provincial Supervision Committee, personally went to the area to investigate the truth and held a villagers' meeting to allow both the plaintiffs and the defendants to express their opinions before making appropriate arrangements. The handling of these opinions has laid a preliminary foundation for direct contact between supervision work and the broad masses. Because the Supervision Committee is a new institution, the broad masses and cadres do not yet fully understand it. Through the handling of these cases, the masses and cadres have gained a considerable understanding of the people's supervision work, which will help to carry out supervision work in the future. The harvest from the suggestion boxes illustrates the importance of following the mass line in supervision work. Although the suggestion boxes have been set up for a short time and have not received many suggestions, they include opinions from people from all walks of life. This "oversight by all" will allow for the timely exposure and correction of some cadres' mistakes and will arouse the vigilance of other cadres. During the period when the Northwest People's Supervision Committee's suggestion boxes were set up, bad elements were discovered damaging the suggestion boxes, such as tearing off seals and breaking boxes. For this reason, the Northwest People's Supervision Committee has asked relevant agencies to pay attention and has asked the broad masses who cherish the people's suggestion boxes to jointly protect them.

　　西北人民监察委员会设置意见箱
    吸收群众意见纠正干部错误
    【本报讯】据西安群众日报消息：为了贯彻监察工作的群众路线，更多的收集人民的意见，西北军政委员会人民监察委员会曾于四月下旬在西安市东、南、西、北四关及钟楼、火车站等处，设置人民意见箱六个，三月来共收到意见七十三件，其中大部分均已及时处理，并将处理结果告诉原提意见人，初步奠定了监察工作与广大群众直接连系的基础。
    在这七十三件意见书中，控告干部违法失职及铺张浪费者二十一件；不同意法院判决，请求重新处理者三件；控告恶霸、特务破坏捣乱及欺诈群众者十八件；向政府建议及质询者十九件；求职及请求离婚者三件；请求处理房屋及债务纠纷者二件；控告群众吸食毒品、违犯社会秩序者七件。提意见者百分之六十七左右没具姓名。西北人民监察委员会对这些意见很重视，一部分直接处理，一部分转令下级监委调查处理并作报告，不属人民监察委员会工作范围者，则函各有关主管部门处理。由监察委员会转各有关机关处理的案件，绝大部分均能及时得到回复。如陕西醴泉县某人检举该县电讯局职员王庶五有官僚主义作风，由监察委员会函令陕西省监察委员会调查处理。陕省监委会得到醴泉县电讯局的报告，详述王庶五确有作风不好的表现，已在整风中进行了初步检讨，并继续作深刻反省。又如陕西省长安县杨国安、杨尚谦等六人控告该县曹堡区第四乡农会主任杨国栋、行政主任李汉臣等贪污案，陕省监察委员会委员师乐天、延学孔二人亲往该处调查真相，并召开村民大会，让原告及被告双方发表意见，然后作了适当处理。这些意见的处理，初步奠定了监察工作与广大群众直接联系的基础。因为监察委员会为新机构，广大群众及干部对之尚不十分了解，经过这些案件的处理，群众和干部对人民监察工作有了相当的认识，有助于今后监察工作的开展。意见箱的收获说明了监察工作走群众路线的重要。意见箱设置时间虽短，收到意见尚不多，但却包括了来自各方面群众的意见。这种“十目所视”的监督将使一些干部的错误得到及时的揭露与纠正，并引起其余干部的警惕。在西北人民监察委员会的意见箱设置时期内，曾发现坏分子破坏意见箱，如扯坏封条，击坏箱子等。为此，西北人民监察委员会已请有关机关注意，并请爱护人民意见箱的广大群众共同予以保护。
