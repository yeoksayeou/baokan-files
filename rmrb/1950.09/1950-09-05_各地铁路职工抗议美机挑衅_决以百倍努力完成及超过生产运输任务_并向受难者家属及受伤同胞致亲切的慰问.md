Railway Workers Across the Country Protest U.S. Provocations
　　Determined to Complete and Exceed Production and Transportation Targets with Redoubled Efforts
　　Extend Cordial Condolences to Families of Victims and Injured Compatriots
　　[This Newspaper] Railway workers across the country continue to protest against the U.S. Air Force's violation of our Northeast airspace, killing and injuring our people, and extend cordial condolences to the families of the victims and injured compatriots.
　　Harbin Locomotive Depot and Station The workers of the Harbin Locomotive Depot, who are enthusiastically discussing the production and financial plan, immediately used large red headlines to prominently and detailedly report the news of the U.S. aircraft's intrusion on the blackboard newspaper. During lunch break, the angry voices of the workers could be heard everywhere in the factory. Yao Zhiping, a special-class model worker, Wang Xueyao, a No. 1040 driver and labor hero, and Zhang Shunqing, an old hero in his sixties, all gritted their teeth and condemned the U.S. imperialists' aggressive ambitions to destroy world peace. Wang Xueyao said, "Our locomotives must resolutely eliminate accidents, not waste a single piece of coal, and do a good job in the 500-kilometer daily car movement." Advanced workers Liu Xikui, veteran workers Wang Delu, Fan Wenkai, Li Lu, and worker Li Rongji all said, "The U.S. imperialists are following the old path of Hitler and the Japanese devils, and they will be destroyed by the powerful forces of the peace and democracy camp. The people of Northeast China must work with the people of the whole country to do a good job in economic construction and strive for a peaceful and happy life." The workers all believe that more production is equal to more cannons, and the Chinese people have the strength to smash U.S. imperialist aggression. The Youth League of the depot organized a forum. Young workers Liu Shantong and Yin Xianglan said angrily, "The U.S. imperialists are provoking wars everywhere. We young workers must work with redoubled efforts to strengthen the country." League members Wang Shuya and Du Shizhong said, "The U.S. imperialists are not reconciled to their defeat in Korea and have come to invade us again. We must turn our anger into strength and defeat the U.S. imperialists so that they will never recover!" Li Yuxiang, Guo Guicha, He Zhenzhou, and Wang Yuqin repeatedly reminded everyone to be vigilant and prevent special agents and traitors in their speeches. Young workers and League members are determined to play a vanguard role in the eight-month production and financial plan.

Chinese railway workers must demand this blood debt be repaid."

Chen Rongli said, "We Chinese people can never forget this blood debt, and the blood debt must be repaid with blood."
