Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, September 23rd: The Council of Ministers of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic has issued a communiqué sternly denouncing the recent unilateral and illegal decisions made by the U.S., British, and French Foreign Ministers' Conference regarding West Germany, which openly tore up the Potsdam Agreement. The full text of the communiqué, according to TASS, is as follows:

"The Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic has studied the decisions passed by the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and France in New York regarding the three countries' policy towards Germany, and considers it necessary to state the following:

　　I. According to the 'Berlin Three-Power Conference Declaration' (Potsdam Agreement) of August 2, 1945, and in accordance with the universally recognized principles of international law, the German people have the right to demand the conclusion of a peace treaty and the subsequent withdrawal of occupying forces. The signatory countries of the Potsdam Agreement have the responsibility to assist the German people in developing peace-loving democratic institutions and, after the final consolidation of Germany's peace-loving democratic system, to conclude a peace treaty.

　　II. The Soviet government and its occupation authorities in Germany have fulfilled the responsibilities under the Potsdam Agreement to eliminate German militarism, eradicate Nazism, and democratize Germany, and have given comprehensive support to the democratic forces in Germany. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is a victorious result of efforts to implement a peaceful and democratic system in Germany. This confirms that the German people have the right to demand the conclusion of a peace treaty and the withdrawal of occupying forces.

　　III. Everything done by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France is contrary to the Potsdam Agreement, thus abandoning their responsibility to guarantee German unity and prevent the development of a democratic system in Germany. The decisions passed by the Foreign Ministers of the above three countries in New York on September 19, 1950, mean that they will continue to pursue a policy of openly disregarding and undermining the Potsdam Agreement. The Western foreign ministers have reached agreement on the following matters:

　　(A) West Germany and West Berlin are included within the aggressive Atlantic Pact.

　　(B) Instead of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, a unilateral declaration states that the occupation statutes remain valid even after the so-called state of war ends, thereby consolidating foreign rule over West Germany.

　　(C) The German people's demand for the withdrawal of occupying forces is rejected, and the number and armament of the Western imperialist troops stationed in Germany are to be greatly increased.

　　(D) German mercenaries are being formed in West Germany to serve Western countries and be commanded by them. Therefore, the process of West Germany's re-militarization is continuing, the arms industry is being restored, while peaceful production is simultaneously decreasing.

　　(E) The foreign ministers of the Western countries, with provocative intent, declare that they consider the movement in West Germany and West Berlin striving for democracy and peace to be a direct attack on the Western occupiers, although this movement is permitted by the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. The Western countries use this attitude to create a political disguise so that they can carry out provocations as they please.

The purpose of the occupation has been unilaterally distorted by them, completely contrary to the Potsdam Agreement, but consistent with the aggressive policy of the United States.

　　IV. These serious violations of the Potsdam Agreement are part of a series of aggressive actions by the United States and Britain against all democratic and peace-loving people. They have already launched a war in Korea. And through the Atlantic Pact, they have made the people of Europe serve the war policy of the United States. They have also openly come out in an attempt to completely seize West Germany.

This has serious consequences for the German people and all other peace-loving people of all countries:

　　(A) The Western occupiers have violated the Potsdam Agreement and are obstructing the restoration of German unity by terror.

　　(B) They have violated the Potsdam Agreement and turned West Germany into their strategic bridgehead, dragging the German people into a new war, thus creating a direct threat to the survival of the German nation.

　　(C) By increasing their troops stationed in Germany, they have violated international law and the Potsdam Agreement, and have committed acts of far-reaching military intervention.

　　(D) Through these measures, they have created a threat to universal peace and to the people striving for peace on German territory.

In order to bring these facts to people's attention, the Government of the German Democratic Republic, on behalf of the entire German people, declares:

The German people firmly demand the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement. The German people demand the conclusion of a peace treaty, the granting of unrestricted sovereignty, and the withdrawal of occupying forces from their national territory. The German people resolutely reject the deceptive trick of the so-called end of the state of war in name only.

The German people will never recognize the decisions and measures of the Western countries, which only serve the cause of war preparation and are against the interests of the German nation.

All the consequences of these provocative war policies shall be borne by the Western occupiers and their German accomplices, such as Adenauer and Schumacher, who want to drive Germans into foreign armies and drag the German people into a new war.

The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic has decided to notify the governments of all countries that have established diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic of its views.

The Government of the German Democratic Republic calls on the German people, especially the people of West Germany, to intensify the nationwide resistance to re-militarization and aggression, to defend Germany's democracy and freedom within the organization of the National Front, thereby guaranteeing peace and unity for the German people. War means the massacre of our people, but we want to live and build in peace and friendship among all nations for a better future."

　　对美英法外长会议关于西德的片面决定
    德国政府发表公报严予驳斥
    坚决要求履行波茨坦宣言缔结和约
    号召德人民抵抗军国主义化和侵略
    【新华社讯】德意志民主共和国临时政府部长会议顷发表公报，严斥美、英、法三外长会议最近公然撕毁波茨坦协定而对西德所作的片面非法决定。据塔斯社柏林二十三日讯：公报全文如下：
    “德意志民主共和国临时政府已研究了美英法三国外长在纽约就三国对德政策所通过的决定，并认为必须声明如下：
    一、根据一九四五年八月二日《柏林三国会议宣言》（波茨坦协定），并依照各国所公认的国际法原则，德国人民有权要求缔订和约并继之撤退占领军。波茨坦协定各签字国，有责任协助德国人民发展爱好和平的民主制度并于德国爱好和平的民主制度最后巩固以后，缔定和约。
    二、苏联政府及其驻德占领机构履行了因波茨坦协定所负的肃清德国军国主义，清除纳粹和使德国民主化等责任，已给德国民主力量以全面的支持。德意志民主共和国的成立即是为在德国采行和平民主制度而努力的胜利结果。这证实了德国人民有权要求缔订和约并撤退占领军。
    三、美，英，法三国政府所做的每一件事情都与波茨坦协定相反，这样毁弃了它们所负保证德国统一的责任和阻止德国民主制度的发展。一九五零年九月十九日上述三国政府外长在纽约通过的决定意味着它们将继续执行公开藐视和破坏波茨坦协定的政策。西方各国外长已就下列事项取得协议：
    （甲）西德和西柏林被列入侵略性的大西洋公约之内。
    （乙）不缔订对德和约，却以片面声明说甚至在所谓战时状态结束以后占领法规仍然有效，以此巩固外国对西德的统治。
    （丙）德国人民要撤退占领军的要求，遭到拒绝，而西方帝国主义驻德国军队的数量和军备反而要大大地增加。
    （丁）德国雇佣军正在西德组成，替西方国家服役，并受他们指挥。因此，西德重行军国主义化的程序正在继续进行，军火工业正在恢复，而和平生产却同时日趋减低。
    （戊）西方国家的外交部长抱着挑衅的目的宣称，他们认为西德和西柏林争取民主与和平的运动是对西方占领者的直接攻击，虽然这种运动乃是波茨坦协定的原则所容许的。西方国家就用这种态度来造成政治伪装，以使他们能够随心所欲地进行挑衅。
    占领的目的已被它们片面地歪曲，它与波茨坦协定完全相反，却和美国的侵略政策一致。
    四、这些严重违反波茨坦协定的行为，是美英对一切民主与爱好和平的人民的一连串侵略行动中的一环。它们已在朝鲜，发动了战争。而通过大西洋公约，他们已使欧洲人民替美国的战争政策服役。他们又已公然出而企图完全攫夺西德。
    这对德国人民和一切其他爱好和平的各国人民引起了严重的后果：
    （甲）西方占领者已违反波茨坦协定，以恐怖的手段妨碍德国统一的恢复。
    （乙）他们违反波茨坦协定，把西德变成他们的战略桥头阵地，要把德国人民拖入新战争，因此就造成了对德国民族生存的直接威胁。
    （丙）由于它们增加在德国的驻军，他们违反了国际法和波茨坦协定，而犯了影响深远的军事干涉行为。
    （丁）由于这些措施，他们在德国领土上造成了对普遍和平、对争取和平的人民的威胁  。
    为了使人们注意这些事实，德意志民主共和国政府代表全体德国人民宣布：
    德国人民坚决要求履行波茨坦协定，德国人民要求缔订和约，给予无限制的主权，并从他们国家的领土上撤退占领军。德国人民断然拒绝字面上的所谓结束战争状态的骗人把戏。
    德国人民永远不承认西方国家的决定和措施，这些决定和措施只是为备战事业而服务，并且是反对德国民族利益的。
    这些挑拨性的战争政策，其一切后果均应由西方占领者和他们的德国同谋者如阿登纳和舒马赫之流负责，他们要把德国人驱迫入外国军队，要把德国人民拖入新的战争中。
    德意志民主共和国部长会议已决定把它的意见，通知与德意志民主共和国建立外交关系的各国政府。
    德意志民主共和国政府号召德国人民，特别是西德的人民，加紧对重行军国主义化和侵略进行举国一致的抵抗，在全国阵线的组织内保卫德国的民主与自由，借此为德国人民保证和平与统一。战争就意味着我国人民的惨遭杀戮，但是我们要为了美好的将来在和平及各民族的友谊中生存并进行建设。”
