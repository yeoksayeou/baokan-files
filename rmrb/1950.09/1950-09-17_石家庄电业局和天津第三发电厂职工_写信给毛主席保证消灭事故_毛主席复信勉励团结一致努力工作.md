Shijiazhuang Electric Power Bureau and Tianjin No. 3 Power Plant Workers
Write to Chairman Mao Guaranteeing Elimination of Accidents
Chairman Mao Replies Encouraging Unity and Hard Work

[This newspaper reports] According to the Central Fuel Industry Department's correspondent group: All employees of the Shijiazhuang Electric Power Bureau in North China and the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau's No. 3 Power Plant are launching a signature campaign to guarantee safe operation and eliminate responsibility accidents, opposing American aggression and defending peace. They wrote to Chairman Mao to report their determination.

The original letter from the Shijiazhuang Electric Power workers is as follows: To Minister Chen Yu of the Central Fuel Industry Department, to our beloved Chairman Mao:
We resolutely oppose the shameless acts of aggression by American imperialism and support the Korean People's Liberation War and the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions guaranteeing safe power delivery, defending world peace. Influenced by the glorious achievement of the Fengshan Power Plant's more than six months without accidents, the Weishui Power Plant and the Shijiazhuang Power Plant have also successively launched campaigns to ensure no accidents in the second half of the year. At the safe operation commendation and mobilization meeting held on July 30, all employees signed their names to work hard to eliminate responsibility accidents.
Accidents in the electric power industry are accidents for the entire industrial sector. We deeply feel the great responsibility of electric power workers in economic construction and have been working hard to prevent accidents. This May, our Electric Power Bureau's Fengshan Power Plant, combined with the implementation of the responsibility system, took the lead in launching a campaign to guarantee no accidents throughout the year. Starting from the beginning of the year, the Fengshan Power Plant has successfully eliminated accidents for more than half a year. We feel honored to have received the award from the Electric Power Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry. At the same time, we fully know that our ability to achieve such results is inseparable from your leadership.
Guaranteeing safe operation and eliminating accidents is something that we electric power workers dared not imagine in the past. Under the rule of the enemy and puppets, workers used machines as if the dead were watching corpses, "talk about it when something goes wrong." At that time, it was believed that accidents were always inevitable. Now it is different. Through our efforts in maintenance and repair, the power output of the steam turbines at the Fengshan Power Plant and the Shijiazhuang Power Plant has been greatly improved, making the machines young again. Not to mention the workers who have become masters of the factory. Therefore, we can break the long-standing conservative idea that "accidents are inevitable," overcome difficulties that we dared not imagine in the past, and bravely launch a campaign to guarantee no accidents. This movement fully illustrates that under your leadership, our working class can take full responsibility for the people's enterprises with the attitude of masters.
Our movement has only taken the first step. We may encounter many difficulties on our way forward. But we know that as long as we carry forward the working class's enterprising spirit and wisdom, resolutely implement the responsibility system and maintenance plans, and launch a comprehensive rationalization proposal movement, any difficulties can be overcome. Under your leadership, we have the confidence to always move forward victoriously.
Finally, let us shout: Long live our beloved leader Chairman Mao!
Shijiazhuang Electric Power Bureau and all its affiliated power plants, all employees
August 8, 1950

The original letter from the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau's No. 3 Power Plant workers is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:
We have seen reports that American imperialist planes have repeatedly invaded our country's Northeast airspace, strafing and killing our compatriots. This shameless act of provocation has made all the employees of our plant very indignant. We must turn this indignation into strength and intensify production. Now we guarantee to provide safe power supply, without a single second of power outage; and resolutely guarantee to eliminate all accidents in production in the second half of 1950. At the same time, we are willing to join hands with our brother workers in Tianjin to work hard in production, strengthen our strength, consolidate our victory, support the Chinese People's Liberation Army to quickly liberate Taiwan, completely eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and support the struggle of the Korean people, driving the American imperialist aggressors into the sea. Finally, let us shout long live our beloved leader Chairman Mao!

After the Central Fuel Industry Department forwarded the letters from the electric power workers in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang to Chairman Mao, it received Chairman Mao's handwritten reply on the 11th of this month. The original text is as follows: Comrade Chen Yu:
I have received the letter from all the employees of the Shijiazhuang Electric Power Bureau and the signed letter from all the employees of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau's No. 3 Power Plant.

The full text of the reply is as follows: To all employees of the Electric Power Management Bureau, Shijiazhuang Electric Power Bureau, and Tianjin Electric Power Bureau No. 3 Power Plant:
Your letter to Chairman Mao has been forwarded to Chairman Mao immediately. We are honored that Chairman Mao took the time out of his busy schedule to personally reply and asked me to convey it to you. Chairman Mao's instructions have now been sent to you as a glorious souvenir.
I hope that all of you will resolutely follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao to "unite as one, work hard, and strive to complete the country's tasks and improve your own lives." And jointly implement all the resolutions of the National Electric Power Conference into your daily work so that they can be fully realized. In your work, strive to give full play to the wisdom of all employees, continuously improve your political, cultural, and technical levels, and jointly improve our people's electric power industry, using practical actions to guarantee the realization of the promises you made in your letter to Chairman Mao to "provide safe power supply and eliminate responsibility accidents," and consolidate existing achievements, and further learn from advanced Soviet electric power technology.
With respect!
Chen Yu, September 16

　　石家庄电业局和天津第三发电厂职工
    写信给毛主席保证消灭事故
    毛主席复信勉励团结一致努力工作
    【本报讯】据中央燃料工业部通讯组报道：华北石家庄电业局所属各电厂和天津电业局第三发电厂全体职工以保证安全运转、消灭责任事故的签名运动，来反对美国侵略，保卫和平。他们上书毛主席报告他们的决心。
    石家庄电业职工的原信如下：中央燃料工业部陈郁部长转亲爱的毛主席：
    我们坚决反对美帝国主义侵略的无耻行为，并以保证安全送电的实际行动来支持朝鲜人民解放战争和台湾的解放，保卫世界的和平。在凤山发电厂半年多无事故的光辉成绩影响下，微水发电厂与石家庄发电厂也相继开展了保证下半年无事故的运动，全体职工在七月三十日召开的安全运转庆功动员大会上，都签名为保证消灭责任事故而努力。
    电业的事故就是整个工业界的事故。我们深感电业职工在经济建设上责任的重大，一直就努力于防止事故的工作。今年五月，我们电业局凤山发电厂结合推行负责制，首先掀起保证全年无事故运动。从年初算起，凤山发电厂已经在半年多的长时间内胜利地消灭了事故。获得燃料工业部电业管理局的奖励，我们感到很光荣。同时我们完全知道，我们能够取得这样的成绩，是与您的领导分不开的。
    保证安全运转，消灭事故，这是我们电业职工过去所不敢想像的事。在敌伪的统治下，工人使唤机器简直是死人看死尸，“出了岔再说”，那时认为事故总是断不了要发生的。现在就不同了。经过我们的努力检修，凤山发电厂和石家庄发电厂的汽机出力都大大提高，使机器都年轻了。当了工厂主人的工人就更不用说了。因此，我们就能够打破长期因袭的“事故不可避免”的保守思想，战胜过去所不敢想像的困难，勇敢地展开了保证无事故运动。这一个运动充分说明了：我们工人阶级在您的领导下，是能够以主人翁态度对人民企业负起完全的责任来。
    我们的运动还只跨开了第一步。在我们前进的道路上可能会遇到许多困难。但是我们知道，只要发扬工人阶级的进取精神和智慧，坚决贯彻负责制与检修计划，展开全面合理化建议运动，任何困难都是可以克服的。在您的领导下，我们有信心永远胜利前进。
    最后，让我们高呼：亲爱的领袖毛主席万岁！
    石家庄电业局及所属各电厂全体职工上
    一九五○年八月八日
    天津电业局第三发电厂职工的原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们看到报载美帝国主义的飞机数次侵入我国东北上空，扫射杀害我国同胞的罪行。这种无耻的挑衅行为，使我全厂职工非常愤慨，我们要把这种愤慨变成力量，加紧生产。现在向您提出保证安全供电，不停电一秒钟；并坚决保证在一九五○年下半年消灭在生产中的一切事故。同时我们并愿与全天津市的职工兄弟们携起手来，努力生产，壮大我们的力量，巩固我们的胜利果实，支援中国人民解放军迅速解放台湾，彻底消灭国民党反动派的残余势力，并声援朝鲜人民的斗争，把美帝国主义的侵略军赶到海里去。最后让我们高呼我们亲爱的领袖毛主席万岁！
    天津电业局第三发电厂全体职工启
    九月五日
    【本报讯】中央燃料工业部通讯组报道：石家庄电业局所属各电厂及天津电业局第三发电厂全体职工，自掀起保证安全运转、消灭责任事故的运动后，于八月八日和九月五日先后给毛主席写信，坚决保证要以安全送电、消灭责任事故的实际行动，来支援解放台湾和朝鲜人民的解放战争。中央燃料工业部将津、石两地电业职工的信转呈毛主席后，于本月十一日已得到毛主席的亲笔回示，原文如下：陈郁同志：
    转来石家庄电业局全体职工给我的信及天津电业局第三发电厂全体职工给我的签名信，均已收到。请你转告两处电业职工同志们感谢他们的好意，希望他们团结一致，努力工作，为完成国家的任务和改善自己的生活而奋斗。
      毛泽东  一九五○年九月十一日
    中央燃料工业部除将毛主席的指示分别寄给石家庄电业局及所属各电厂和天津电业局第三发电厂外，陈郁部长并复函鼓励他们为实现向毛主席保证的诺言而奋斗。复函全文如下：电业管理总局转石家庄电业局、天津电业局第三发电厂全体职工同志：
    你们写给毛主席的信已经立即转呈了毛主席。蒙毛主席在百忙中亲笔回示，并让我转告你们。现已将毛主席的指示寄给你们，留作光荣的纪念。
    希望你们全体职工坚决地照着毛主席所指示的方向“团结一致，努力工作，为完成国家的任务和改善自己的生活而奋斗。”并把全国电业会议的各项决议共同贯彻到日常工作中，使其完全实现。在工作中努力发挥全体职工的智慧，不断地提高自己的政治、文化和技术水平，共同搞好我们人民的电业，用实际行动来保证实现你们写给毛主席的信中所说的“安全供电，消灭责任事故”的诺言，并巩固已有的成绩，进一步向先进的苏联电业技术学习。
    此致敬礼！
    陈郁  九月十六日
