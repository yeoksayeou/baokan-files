　　How to Lead the Masses in Disinfecting Wheat Seeds
    Xi Fengzhou
    In recent years, wheat smut has become quite serious. In the provinces of North China, as well as Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, this disease has become one of the main reasons for reduced production. In mild cases, yields are reduced by 5 to 10 percent, while in severe cases, yields are reduced by 20 to 30 percent. In individual areas or parts of wheat fields, the severity of wheat stinking smut has been so great that there has been almost no harvest!
    In preventing crop diseases, "prevention is more important than cure" is our basic principle in the fight against pests and diseases. Now that autumn has arrived and wheat is about to be sown, seizing the opportunity to organize the masses to disinfect seeds is an important task in current agricultural production.
    The method of seed disinfection to prevent disease has accumulated some experience in many areas of Northeast and North China, and many farmers have also benefited from seed disinfection. In addition, the amount of medicine used in seed dressing is small, the cost is not high, and it is relatively easy to promote. In areas where seed disinfection is customary, the masses have a preliminary understanding of methods such as seed dressing and seed soaking. We should organize and lead the promotion of these methods. In general newly liberated areas or areas where seed disinfection is not customary, although farmers have not benefited from seed disinfection, they deeply feel the pain due to the severity of wheat diseases over the years. With good publicity and advocacy, the masses will be happy to accept it. At the beginning of the promotion of seed disinfection technology, some farmers will have doubts in their minds, such as thinking that seed disinfection will cause "failure to emerge from the soil," "fear of delaying work," and "disinfection is useless," etc. However, as long as we patiently persuade them, coupled with typical demonstrations, the obstacles in the minds of the masses will gradually be eliminated.
    Wheat seed disinfection is a scientific and technical work, and the methods are very specific. Therefore, when deploying this work, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance and be very serious in order to achieve the purpose of preventing and eliminating diseases. According to the past experience of promoting seed disinfection in Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, Shandong and other places, some areas have neglected technical guidance beforehand, resulting in many deviations: some could not grasp the soaking temperature and time when using warm water soaking; in some areas of East China, Chahar, and Shanxi, some used medicine for seed dressing and then washed it with warm water again, resulting in the seed disinfection not working. This not only wasted labor and medicine, but also gave the masses a bad impression, increasing the difficulty of promoting seed disinfection work in the future. All these lessons are worth serious attention.
    The key to making seed disinfection work is to effectively hand this technology over to the masses. Only when the masses master the technology can seed disinfection work be deepened and carried out.
    The wheat sowing season is approaching. In order to implement wheat seed disinfection in a timely manner, first of all, cadres who lead agricultural production, especially rural grassroots cadres, labor models, and technical experts, must learn this technology. In areas where wheat smut is severe, base points should be selected to hold small seminars and training courses to demonstrate seed disinfection technology on the spot. In addition, popular publicity materials on seed disinfection technology can also be printed and distributed.
    Agricultural agencies, agricultural schools, and farms in various places should take some time and manpower, with high revolutionary enthusiasm, to go deep into the countryside and specifically help the masses with wheat seed disinfection. For example, in the spring of this year, Chahar Province sent a technical promotion team to Chabei to help the masses with seed disinfection. In more than forty days, they promoted the establishment of 84 promotion groups in 60 villages in 7 counties. A total of more than 480 people were organized to learn seed disinfection technology. After teaching and promotion, more than 10,000 people in the Chabei Special District learned the technology of soaking and dressing seeds (an average of one in ten people learned it). According to statistics from 37 villages in Shanyin, Shuo County, and Huairen counties alone, 3,627 households practiced warm water soaking, accounting for 65 percent of the total number of households in the villages. This shows that as long as cadres are sent to specifically organize and guide, seed disinfection work will be carried out smoothly!
    In addition, wheat nematode disease is also relatively common and serious in various places. In seed treatment work, in areas without sifting machines, salt water, muddy water, and sifting and water selection methods can be used to eliminate diseased grains, prevent and reduce the occurrence of diseases.

　　如何领导群众进行小麦种子消毒
    席凤洲
    近年小麦黑穗病相当严重。在华北各省及山东、河南、陕、甘等地，这种病害，已成为减产主要原因之一。轻者减产到百分之五到百分之十，重者减产到百分之二十至三十。个别地区或部分麦田，有因小麦腥黑穗病的过于严重，几无收获！
    在防止作物病害问题上，“防重于治”，是我们向病虫害作斗争的基本方针。现秋季已到，小麦即将播种，在领导上抓紧时机，组织群众进行种子消毒，是当前农业生产上一个重要任务。
    种子消毒防止病害的方法，在东北、华北不少地区，已积累了一些经验，很多农户也得到种子消毒的利益。加以推广药剂拌种使用药量少，化费不大，比较容易推行。在种子消毒有习惯地区，群众对于拌种、浸种等方法，已有了初步认识，应该有组织、有领导地进行推广；在一般新解放区或没有种子消毒习惯地区，农民虽未得到过种子消毒的利益，但由于历年小麦病害的严重，深感痛苦，我们再很好地进行宣传与倡导，群众是会乐于接受的。在开始推广种子消毒技术时，部分农民思想上会有疑虑，如认为种子消毒后：“不出土”、“怕误工”、“消毒无用”等，但只要耐心地说服，加上典型示范，群众思想上的障碍是会逐渐消除的。
    小麦种子消毒，是一种科学技术工作，在作法上是非常具体的，因此，布置这一工作时，必须加强技术指导，要十分认真，以达到防除病害的目的。根据过去河北、察哈尔、山西、山东等地推广种子消毒的经验，有些地区，因为事前忽视了技术指导，发生了很多偏差：有的用温汤浸种时，掌握不了浸种温度与时间；在华东、察哈尔、山西个别地区有的用药拌种后，又用温汤浸洗了一遍，结果，产生了种子消毒以后不起作用，这不仅浪费了人工和药剂，而且会给群众以不良印象，增加了将来推广种子消毒工作上的困难。所有这些经验教训，是值得严重注意的。
    使种子消毒工作发挥作用的关键，在于把这种技术切实交给群众。只有群众掌握了技术，种子消毒工作才能够深入与开展。
    麦子播种时期已经迫近，为了把麦种消毒工作及时贯彻下去，首先要使领导农业生产的干部特别是农村基层干部和劳模、技术能手学会这种技术。在小麦黑穗病严重地区，应选定基点，召开小型座谈会及训练班，实地表演种子消毒技术。此外，还可以印发种子消毒技术通俗宣传品。
    农业机关、农业学校及各地农场，应该抽出一定的时间与人力，以高度的革命热情，深入农村，具体帮助群众进行麦种消毒。如今年春季，察哈尔省派出了技术推广队赴察北帮助群众进行种子消毒，在四十余天中，推动七个县六十个村建立了八十四个推广小组，前后共组织了四百八十余人学习了种子消毒技术，经过传授推广，察北专区内有一万多人学会浸种、拌种技术（平均每十人中有一人学会了）。仅据山阴、朔县、怀仁等县三十七个村中的统计，实行温汤浸种的农户，有三千六百二十七户，即占村中总户数百分之六十五。这说明只要派出干部具体组织指导，种子消毒工作就会顺利开展！
    此外，小麦线虫病，各地也较普遍严重，在种子处理工作上，如没有汰选机地区，可用盐水、泥水及筛选、水选等选种方法汰除病粒，防止与减少病害发生。
