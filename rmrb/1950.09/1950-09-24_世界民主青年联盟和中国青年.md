　　World Federation of Democratic Youth and Chinese Youth

　　The years since the establishment of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFMDY) have been a period of heroic liberation war and great victory for the Chinese people. Under the general principle of uniting democratic youth around the world to resolutely fight against imperialism and strive for lasting peace, democracy, national independence, and a bright future for youth, the WFMDY has been concerned about and supported the revolutionary struggle waged by Chinese youth and the people. At the same time, Chinese youth also believe that the WFMDY's policies and activities are in line with the wishes and interests of Chinese youth and youth around the world. Therefore, from the beginning, they have been active participants and supporters of the WFMDY.

　　Since the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang jointly launched a civil war against the Chinese people, the WFMDY has repeatedly condemned the crimes of American imperialism in interfering in and invading China at its council and executive committee meetings. It has helped expose the vile face of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries in implementing dictatorial, traitorous, and civil war policies before world public opinion, and called on democratic youth from all countries to support the just struggle of the Chinese people and youth. The WFMDY's publications have continuously promoted the victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the efforts of Chinese youth to participate in the Liberation War and build a new China, the struggles of youth and students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and protested against the Kuomintang-American repression of youth.

　　Among these, there are several actions of the WFMDY that are particularly worth mentioning. When the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference of the three countries was held in March 1947, the WFMDY sent a telegram opposing American imperialism's interference in China and supporting the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries in carrying out a civil war, believing that this was completely contrary to the interests of the Chinese people. In August of the same year, following the first World Youth Festival, the WFMDY Council held in Prague, after listening to the Chinese youth representatives' accusations against the Kuomintang-American persecution of Chinese democratic youth and the student movement, formally passed a resolution severely condemning the Kuomintang-American atrocities and decided to suspend the membership of the Kuomintang reactionary Sanqing Tuan. Then, on November 10, commemorating "World Youth Day," the WFMDY specially issued an appeal calling on democratic youth around the world to unite in supporting the struggle of Chinese youth and students.

　　The several international conferences organized by the WFMDY in 1947 and 1948, such as the first World Youth Festival, the Southeast Asia Youth Conference, and the Warsaw World Youth Workers' Conference, supported and encouraged the struggle of Chinese youth through the enthusiastic welcome of democratic youth delegations from various countries.

　　When the Chinese People's Liberation Army achieved great victories in the Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin campaigns, the WFMDY immediately expressed its congratulations to the Chinese people and youth. Soon, Nanjing and Shanghai were liberated, and the WFMDY organized the leaders of youth organizations from 27 countries to jointly send congratulations to the Chinese people and youth. The telegram said: "We unanimously believe that this victory should be seen as a great victory for the democratic forces of the world."

　　The WFMDY felt great excitement about the new development of the Chinese youth movement under the victorious situation of the revolution—the establishment of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation. For example, in the WFMDY's congratulatory telegram to the First National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, it said: "The Chinese youth movement has set an encouraging example for the democratic youth movement around the world by practically participating in the Chinese liberation struggle and the construction work in the liberated areas." At that time, both the First National Youth Congress and the National Student Congress received very warm congratulatory telegrams from the WFMDY.

　　Last fall, the Chinese democratic youth delegation that participated in the Second World Youth and Student Festival and the Second Congress of the WFMDY received an extremely warm welcome. The resolution of the Second Congress of the WFMDY stated: "The Congress warmly celebrates the great victory of the Chinese people and pays tribute to the heroic Chinese youth who selflessly participated in the struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland." In his report to the Congress, WFMDY President Boileau further stated that the WFMDY has the responsibility to explain to the youth of the world the significance of the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for the development of the independence struggles of the oppressed nations. The Second Congress of the WFMDY re-elected the leading bodies, and Feng Wenbin, Liao Chengzhi, Xiao Hua, Han Tianshi, Chen Jiakang, and Qian Sanqiang from our country were elected as members of the Council, and Liao Chengzhi was elected as Vice President of the WFMDY.

　　This is the situation of the WFMDY's concern for the Chinese revolutionary struggle and its support for the struggle of Chinese youth. In addition, all other struggles led by the WFMDY have played a certain supporting role in the Chinese revolution and the youth movement, because the revolutionary struggles of the people all over the world are closely linked together.

　　As for the support of Chinese youth for the WFMDY, this is mainly reflected in two aspects.

　　First of all, Chinese youth, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely carry out the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and actively participate in the construction of a new China, which is the most powerful support for the WFMDY. The victory of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of a new China have greatly strengthened the world's peace and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union, and at the same time increased the strength of the world democratic youth front; it has severely hit and weakened the enemies of peace and democracy—the imperialist camp headed by American imperialism, and at the same time severely hit and weakened the enemies of the world's democratic youth.

　　This is one aspect.

　　On the other hand, Chinese youth have always supported and cared about the work of the WFMDY. Representatives of Chinese democratic youth participated in the founding conference of the WFMDY—the London World Youth Conference. Representatives of Chinese democratic youth have always participated in the leading bodies of the WFMDY—the Council and the Executive Committee. We often have representatives stationed at the WFMDY headquarters. When the Second Congress of the WFMDY was held last year, we organized a large-scale delegation to participate. Chinese youth actively participated in the important international activities organized by the WFMDY, such as the First World Youth Festival held in Prague in 1947, the Southeast Asia Youth Conference in February 1948, the Warsaw World Youth Workers' Conference in August of the same year, and the Second World Youth and Student Festival in 1949. We also actively responded to the WFMDY's call, such as commemorating many festivals of the international youth movement and launching this peace signature movement and supporting the Korean youth movement. At the same time, through many activities and publications, we widely publicized the WFMDY among Chinese youth and continuously strengthened the internationalist education of youth.

　　This visit to China by the WFMDY delegation will undoubtedly further strengthen the connection between Chinese youth and the WFMDY, expand the influence of the WFMDY among Chinese youth, and enable the friendship and unity between Chinese youth and democratic youth from all countries to be further developed.

### 世界民主青年联盟和中国青年

　　世界民主青年联盟和中国青年
    世界民主青年联盟成立以来的这几年，正是中国人民进行英勇的解放战争并且取得伟大胜利的时期。世界青联在团结全世界民主青年，坚决为反对帝国主义、争取持久和平、民主、各民族独立和青年美好前途而斗争的总方针下，一直关切和支援中国青年和人民在一起所进行的革命斗争。同时，中国青年也认为世界青联的方针与活动，是符合中国青年和全世界青年的愿望和利益的，因此自始就是世界青联的积极参加者和支持者。
    自从美国帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮联合发动反对中国人民的内战以后，世界青联在历次的理事会和执行委员会会议上，曾经一再谴责美国帝国主义干涉和侵略中国的罪行，在世界舆论面前帮助揭露蒋介石反动派执行独裁、卖国和内战政策的凶恶面目，号召各国民主青年声援中国人民和青年的正义斗争。世界青联的出版物，则不断宣传中国人民解放军的胜利，宣传中国青年参加解放战争和建设新中国的努力，宣传国民党统治区青年和学生的斗争并抗议美蒋历次迫害青年的暴行。
    在这中间，世界青联有几次行动是特别值得一提的。当一九四七年三月莫斯科三国外长会议时，世界青联曾去电反对美国帝国主义干涉中国和支持蒋介石反动派进行内战，认为这是完全违背中国人民的利益的。同年八月继第一次世界青年联欢节后在布拉格召开的世界青联理事会，在听取中国青年代表控诉美蒋迫害中国民主青年和学生运动以后，正式通过决议，严厉斥责美蒋暴行，并决定停止国民党反动派的三青团的会籍。接着在十一月十日纪念“世界青年日”时，世界青联又特别发出呼吁书，号召全世界民主青年一致声援中国青年和学生的斗争。
    世界青联在一九四七和四八年所组织的几次国际性大会，如第一次世界青年联欢节、东南亚青年大会和华沙世界青工大会等，通过各国青年对我国民主青年代表团的热烈欢迎，支持和鼓舞了中国青年的斗争。
    当中国人民解放军取得辽沈、淮海和平津三大战役的伟大胜利时，世界青联立即向中国人民和青年表示庆贺。不久，南京上海宣告解放，世界青联更组织了二十七国青年团体的领导人，联名向中国人民和青年致贺。贺电中说：“我们一致认为，这个胜利应该看作是全世界民主力量的巨大胜利”。
    世界青联对于中国青年运动在革命胜利形势下的新发展——中国新民主主义青年团、全国民主青联和全国学联的成立，感到很大的兴奋。例如在世界青联给中国新民主主义青年团第一次代表大会的贺电中说：“中国青年运动由于实际参加中国解放斗争和解放区的建设工作，已给全世界民主青年运动树立了鼓舞的榜样”。当时第一次全国青年代表大会和全国学生代表大会，都曾收到世界青联很热烈的贺电。
    去年秋，参加第二次世界青年和学生联欢节以及世界青联第二次代表大会的中国民主青年代表团，受到极其热烈的欢迎。世界青联第二次代表大会的决议写道：“大会热烈庆祝中国人民的伟大胜利，并向那些为了祖国的自由和独立而忘我地参加斗争的英勇的中国青年致敬”。世界青联主席鲍埃逊在向大会所作的报告中更说到，世界青联有责任给全世界青年说明，中国人民解放军的辉煌胜利对于各被压迫民族独立斗争的发展将有如何重大的意义。世界青联第二次代表大会改选领导机关，我国冯文彬、廖承志、萧华、韩天石、陈家康、钱三强当选为理事会理事，廖承志并被选为世界青联副主席。
    这就是世界青联关切中国革命斗争与支援中国青年斗争的情形。此外世界青联所领导的其他一切斗争，都对中国革命与青年运动起了一定的支援作用，因为全世界人民的革命斗争是紧密地结合在一起的。
    至于中国青年对于世界青联的支持，这主要表现在两方面。
    首先，中国青年和全国人民一道，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，坚决进行反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争，并且积极参加新中国的建设，这就是对世界青联最有力的支持。中国革命的胜利和新中国的建立，大大增强了以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量，同时也就增加了世界民主青年战线的力量；严重打击和削弱了和平民主的敌人——以美国帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营，同时也就严重打击和削弱了世界民主青年的敌人。
    这是一方面。
    另一方面，中国青年一直支持和关心世界青联的工作，中国民主青年的代表，参加了世界青联的成立大会——伦敦世界青年大会。中国民主青年代表一直参加世界青联领导机关——理事会和执行委员会。我们经常派有代表留驻世界青联总部工作。当去年举行世界青联第二次代表大会时，我们曾组织大规模代表团前往参加。中国青年积极地参加了世界青联历次所组织的重要国际活动，如一九四七年在布拉格举行的第一次世界青年联欢节、一九四八年二月的东南亚青年大会、同年八月的华沙世界青工大会、和一九四九年的第二次世界青年和学生联欢节等。我们还积极响应世界青联的号召，如纪念国际青年运动的许多节日和这次发动和平签名运动与支援朝鲜青年运动等。同时通过许多活动和出版物，在中国青年中间广泛宣传世界青联，不断加强青年的国际主义教育。
    这次世界青联代表团访问中国，无疑地将进一步加强中国青年和世界青联的联系，扩大世界青联在中国青年中的影响，使中国青年和各国民主青年之间的友谊和团结，得到更进一步的发展。
