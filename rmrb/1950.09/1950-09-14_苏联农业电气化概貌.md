　　An Overview of the Electrification of Soviet Agriculture

    The Soviet Union now ranks first in Europe in electricity production, and the scale of its agricultural electrification is the largest in the world. Before the October Revolution, however, there were only eighty rural power stations in the whole country, with a generating capacity of about two thousand kilowatts. When the Soviet Union began to implement the collectivization of agriculture in 1929, seven hundred small power stations were established in the countryside. Four years later, the number of collective farms using electricity tripled. By 1940, ten thousand collective farms and two thousand five hundred agricultural machine stations were using electricity.

    During the Great Patriotic War, many rural power stations in the Soviet Union were severely damaged. While the war was still going on in February 1945, Stalin signed a decision on the development of rural electrification, proposing a broad plan for the construction of small hydroelectric power stations. In 1945 alone, the Soviet Union built six hundred and one rural hydroelectric power stations, providing electricity to two thousand five hundred collective farms and seven hundred machine tractor stations. By January 1946, the generating capacity of rural power stations had reached pre-war levels, and two years later, it had increased dramatically to twice the pre-war level.

    In May 1948, the Soviet Council of Ministers formulated a plan to add rural power stations from 1948 to 1950. In 1948, about three thousand two hundred and fifty power stations began generating electricity, providing electricity to six thousand collective farms and eight hundred machine tractor stations. More than three thousand five hundred power stations were completed in 1949. The hydroelectric and thermal power stations built in the first half of this year are equivalent to twice the number built in the same period last year. By the end of 1950, all collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations in the Soviet Union will be electrified.

    Many Soviet states have been transformed by electrification. Take Sverdlovsk Oblast as an example: now all two thousand and eighty-three collective farms, eighty-four machine tractor stations, and ten state farms in the entire state have been completely electrified. One hundred and thirty-eight thousand residences, two thousand rural schools, three hundred hospitals, clinics and pharmacies, one thousand clubs and reading rooms, nine thousand livestock farms, and two thousand blacksmith shops and workshops have all been lit up. The countryside in the state has five hundred cinemas with sound and hundreds of radio relay stations, and the generating capacity of rural power stations will reach two million kilowatts.

    Rural electrification has greatly increased agricultural production. At present, electricity is widely used in rural areas for ploughing, sowing, irrigation, threshing, preparing feed, and processing agricultural products, reducing labor consumption, accelerating the agricultural production process, and increasing crop yields and livestock productivity. Electric tractors can cultivate six hectares of land per hour, more than double the productivity of ordinary tractors. Electric milking increases labor productivity by 40 percent. Shearing sheep with electricity can increase labor productivity by 50 percent. In 1948 alone, collective farms in the Soviet Union saved 98 million physical labor days due to the electrification of the production process.

    Agricultural electrification has also improved the living standards of rural residents. Many farm families have electric refrigerators, radios, and other electrical equipment, and farmers generally enjoy a happy socialist life.

### 苏联农业电气化概貌

　　苏联农业电气化概貌
    苏联现在的电力生产占欧洲第一位，农业电气化的规模居世界第一位。但在十月革命以前，全国只有八十个农村电力站，发电能力约为二千千瓦。在一九二九年苏联开始实现农业的集体化时，便在农村中建立了七百个小型的电力站。四年之后，使用了电力的集体农场就增加了三倍。到一九四○年，已有一万个集体农场和二千五百个农业机器站使用了电力。
    在卫国战争期间，苏联许多农村发电站受到了严重的破坏。当一九四五年二月战争还在进行的时候，斯大林就签署了关于发展农村电气化的决定，提出了建设小型水力发电站的广泛计划。仅在一九四五年，苏联便建造了六百零一个农村水电站，使二千五百个集体农场和七百个机器拖拉机站获得了电力供应。到一九四六年一月，农村电力站的发电能力便达到了战前水平，两年之后，又激增为战前的两倍。
    一九四八年五月，苏联部长会议拟定了一九四八——一九五○年增设农村电力站的计划。在一九四八年内，约有三千二百五十个电力站开始发电，使六千个集体农场和八百个机器拖拉机站获得了电力。一九四九年内落成的电力站达三千五百余个。今年上半年所建造的水力与热力发电站，又相当于去年同期的两倍。到一九五○年底，苏联的集体农场、国营农场与机器拖拉机站将全部电气化。
    苏联的许多州已因电气化而焕然一新，以斯维德罗夫斯克州为例：现在全州的二千零八十三个集体农场，八十四个机器拖拉机站与十个国营农场已经完全电气化了。十三万八千座住宅，两千所农村学校，三百所医院、诊疗所和药房，一千个俱乐部与阅览室，九千个牧畜场，二千个锻铁场和作坊，都已大放光明。该州的农村内共拥有五百个有声电影院和数百个无线电转播站，农村发电站的发电量将达二百万千瓦。
    乡村电气化使农业生产获得了巨大的增加。目前在农村中，已广泛使用电力进行耕种、播种、灌溉、打谷，预备饲料及农产品加工的工作，减低了工作量的消耗，加速了农业生产过程，并且提高了农作物的收获量和牧畜的产物生产率。电气拖拉机每小时可耕地六公顷，超过普通拖拉机生产力的一倍。电气榨乳把劳动生产率提高了百分之四十。以电力剪羊毛可提高劳动生产率百分之五十。仅在一九四八年，苏联各集体农场由于生产过程的电气化，就节省了九千八百万个体力劳动。
    农业电气化也提高了乡村居民的生活水平，许多农家都自备有电气冰箱、无线电收音机及其他电气设备，农民们普遍享受着社会主义的幸福生活。
