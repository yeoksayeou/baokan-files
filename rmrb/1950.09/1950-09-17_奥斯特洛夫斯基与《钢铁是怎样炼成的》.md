　　Ostrovsky and "How the Steel Was Tempered"
　　Sun Weishi

　　The publication of "How the Steel Was Tempered" shook the entire Soviet literary scene. The author, Nikolai Ostrovsky, was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1935. He wrote a letter to Comrade Stalin saying: "...The government has given me the highest award. The Party's faithful assistant, the Leninist Communist Youth League, educated and cultivated me. As long as my heart is still beating, as long as it hasn't stopped its last beat, I will dedicate my entire life to the cause of educating the new generation of Bolsheviks in our socialist motherland...."

　　Pavel Korchagin is the protagonist of this novel. Ostrovsky used Pavel Korchagin to write about his own hard-fought life. This is a great work of art that reflects historical truth. The lovableness of the hero Pavel Korchagin lies in the fact that he is not a superman, not a figure detached from us. He is an ordinary person, and it is precisely this ordinary person who has done many extraordinary things. He is a hero worthy of praise. Countless such heroic figures emerged during the Soviet Patriotic War and the Chinese People's Liberation War. Pavel Korchagin is one of the millions of Bolsheviks "made of special material." The heroic deeds of such heroic figures do not mean that he alone decided the outcome or reversed the wheels of history. The heroism of such heroic figures lies in the fact that he dedicated his entire life and energy to the greatest cause in the world—the struggle for human liberation.

　　Pavel Korchagin's life is similar to the lives of many children of the working people. What sets him apart is that even after he was paralyzed and blind, he was still able to persevere in his work. When the doctor pronounced his death sentence, telling him that he had completely lost his ability to work and only had a few years of life left, what caused him the greatest pain was not the threat of death. His greatest pain was that he could not continue to work for the Party and continue to fight for the proletarian cause. If life was only for eating, drinking, and breathing, then life would completely lose its value for him. With the greatest perseverance, he overcame this pain that others could not overcome. He confidently said: "It is simpler and easier to become a resolute person when you have health and youth, but it is a real honor to persevere now." As long as there is still a part of his body that has not died, he will never stop working. It is precisely for work that he can live. The purpose of Pavel Korchagin's existence gave him endless strength.

　　Not long before Ostrovsky's death, he asked the doctor: "Please tell me, how long can I live?" When the doctor replied that he could not answer such questions for patients, he smiled and said: "I am not a patient, I am just a wounded soldier. Soldiers are not afraid of death. I only need your correct answer to make my work plan, understand?"

　　Ostrovsky once said that some people who have read "How the Steel Was Tempered" only felt Pavel's pain because they did not understand Pavel's purpose in fighting and his Party spirit. Pavel Korchagin was not feeling pain, but overcoming pain. There is nothing more pleasant in the world than overcoming pain. A person should fight, should win, and that is Pavel Korchagin's optimism.

　　This is a hymn to life. If he lived only for himself, Pavel Korchagin would have been destroyed long ago. Life is beautiful, and it is for this infinitely beautiful life that we must wage a tenacious struggle. This is the source of Pavel Korchagin's strength, and it is also Pavel Korchagin's happiness.

　　奥斯特洛夫斯基与《钢铁是怎样炼成的》
    孙维世
    《钢铁是怎样炼成的》一书的出版，震撼了整个苏联文坛。作者奥斯特洛夫斯基于一九三五年获得列宁勋章。他给斯大林同志写了一封信说：“…政府给了我最高的奖励，党的忠实的助手列宁共产主义青年团教育和培养了我，只要我的心还在跳，只要他还没有停止最后一下跳动以前，我一定要将全部生命，供献给我们社会主义祖国新一代的布尔什维克教育事业。……”
    保尔·柯察金就是这部小说的主人翁，奥斯托洛夫斯基用保尔·柯察金写出他自己艰苦奋斗的一生。这是一部伟大的艺术作品，它反映了历史的真实。保尔·柯察金这英雄人物的可爱，因为他不是一个超人，不是一个与我们隔绝的人物，他是个平凡的人，正是这种平凡的人干出了许多不平凡的事情，他是一个值得歌颂的英雄，这类英雄人物在苏联卫国战争及中国人民解放战争中出现了不知多少，保尔·柯察金是千百万“以特殊材料制成的”布尔什维克中的一个。这种英雄人物所干的英雄事迹，并不是他一个人决定了乾坤，扭转了历史的车轮，这种英雄人物的英雄事迹就在于他把自己的全部生命与精力，供献给世界上最伟大的事业——为人类自由解放而斗争。
    保尔·柯察金的一生与许多劳动人民儿女的一生很相似，他所与众不同的，就是在他已经全身瘫痪，瞎了双眼以后，他还能坚持在自己的工作岗位上。当医生宣布了他的死刑，告诉他已经完全失掉劳动能力，只有几年残余的生命时，使他感到最大痛苦的不是死的威胁，他的最大痛苦就是不能继续为党工作，不能为无产阶级事业继续奋斗。如果生命只是为了吃喝与喘气，那生命对他就完全失去了价值，他以最大的坚忍克服了这人所不能克服的痛苦，他有信心地说：“有健康和青春的时候成为一个坚毅不拔的人是比较简单和容易，可是现在如果能坚持下去，那才是真正的荣誉呢。”只要他身体上还有一部分机构没有死亡，他决不会停止工作，正是为了工作他才能生活。保尔·柯察金生存的目的给予了他无穷无尽的力量。
    奥斯特洛夫斯基去世前不久，他曾这样问过医生：“请告诉我，我还能活多久？”当医生回答他说医生不能回答病人这类问题时，他微笑着说：“我不是病人，我仅是个受了伤的战士，战士是不怕死的，我仅仅需要你正确的回答来制定我的工作计划，明白不？”
    奥斯特洛夫斯基曾说过，有人看过《钢铁是怎样炼成的》只留下了保尔痛苦的感觉，那是因为他不明白保尔斗争的目的与他斗争的党性，保尔·柯察金不是在感觉痛苦，而是在克服痛苦，世界上再也没有比克服痛苦更愉快的事情了，一个人应该斗争，应该胜利，这就是保尔·柯察金的乐观主义。
    这是一首生命的赞美歌，如果仅只是为了自己而生活，那保尔·柯察金早已毁灭。生活是美好的，正是为了这无限美好的生活去作顽强斗争，这就是保尔·柯察金力量的源泉，也就是保尔·柯察金的幸福。
