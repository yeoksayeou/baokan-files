Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: The governments of Latin American countries, blindly following the orders of U.S. imperialism, have recently been attacking progressive and peaceful forces with increasing frequency in order to adapt to the U.S.'s comprehensive plan to strengthen fascist rule and advance war, but have been met with widespread resistance from the people.

According to news arriving here successively, the Cuban government sealed up the progressive newspaper "Hoy" on August 24th, and Prime Minister Falos personally led armed police to destroy the newspaper's editorial department the next day. This barbaric act of the Cuban government aroused strong protests from all sides. The Cuban People's Socialist Party immediately issued a statement condemning the government's anti-democratic action and stated that "the people will fight with greater force to combat war, imperialist intervention, and fascist suppression." The Cuban working people held rallies and demonstrations to protest the government's atrocities and demanded guarantees of democratic freedoms and rights.

The Cuban government responded to the people's demands with high pressure, carrying out large-scale arrests throughout the country, and on August 29th, it also closed the "American Movement" newspaper, which was published on the 26th. However, the people did not succumb to this. Under the leadership of Escalante, the former president of the "Hoy" newspaper, the "Afternoon News," which had a tradition of fighting for freedom, resumed publication in daily form on the 30th, condemning the government's attack on the people's democratic rights as part of the North American imperialist war plan and the general offensive against democratic forces. Despite police persecution and obstruction of distribution, the newspaper's sales reached 20,000 copies.

This anti-democratic action of the Cuban government aroused protests from workers, peasants, students, senators, and democrats in Ecuador, Mexico, Argentina, and other countries.

At the same time, similar fascist suppression measures also occurred in other Latin American countries. The Argentine Parliament submitted a bill in August to outlaw the Communist Party. The Brazilian government ordered the trial in absentia of Communist Party General Secretary Prestes and other leaders of the Communist Party on August 21st. The Guatemalan government also closed the Communist Party newspaper "October" because it had condemned the U.S. aggression in Korea. The Costa Rican government arrested the General Secretary of the General Labor Union, Herminas, in August and sentenced him to a long prison term.

The people of Latin American countries have expressed their strong opposition to these reactionary measures of their respective governments, which cater to the U.S. imperialist war policy, by expanding the peace signature campaign and opposing the U.S. imperialist war policy. In Argentina, under strict police rule, the number of signatures on the Stockholm Peace Appeal exceeded one million in late August. In Chile, with a population of just over five million, the Videla fascist rule and suppression could not stop the people's movement in support of peace, and peace signatures reached 120,000. In Uruguay, where newspapers exposed the U.S. ambassador's shameless oppression to force the country to send troops to support the war of aggression against Korea, thousands of working people held a demonstration in front of the U.S. embassy on the 14th of this month, chanting slogans of "Oppose War" and demanding the withdrawal of imperialist intervention troops from Korea. Similar people's demonstrations also occurred in Chile at the end of August.

### 反对法西斯镇压和战争政策  拉丁美洲人民扩大和平签名

　　反对法西斯镇压和战争政策
    拉丁美洲人民扩大和平签名
    【新华社二十三日讯】一味遵奉美国帝国主义命令行事的拉丁美洲各国政府，为着适应美国加强法西斯统治、推进战争的全面计划，最近愈来愈频繁地对进步与和平的力量实行进攻，但却遭到人民普遍的反抗。
    据陆续到达此地的消息，古巴政府于八月二十四日查封进步报纸《今日新闻》，总理发洛斯并亲自率领武装警察于次日捣毁该报社的编辑部。古巴政府的这一野蛮行动，激起了各方面的强烈抗议。古巴人民社会党立即发表声明，斥责政府这一反民主行动，并表示“人民将以更大的力量奋斗下去，打击战争、帝国主义干涉和法西斯镇压”。古巴劳动人民纷纷举行集会游行，抗议政府暴行，要求保障民主自由权利。
    古巴政府用高压来回答人民的要求，在全国实行大规模的逮捕，并于八月二十九日又封闭于二十六日出版的《美洲运动》报。但人民并不因此屈服，在原《今日新闻》报社长埃斯卡兰特主持之下，曾有为自由而斗争之传统的《午报》以日报形式于三十日恢复出版，谴责政府对人民民主权利的进攻，是北美帝国主义战争计划和对民主力量总进攻的一部分。尽管有警察的迫害和阻挠发行，该报的销路却达到二万份。
    古巴政府这一反民主的行动，引起了厄瓜多尔、墨西哥、阿根廷等国工人、农民、学生及参议员、民主人士的抗议。
    与此同时，同类的法西斯镇压措施也发生于其他一些拉丁美洲国家。阿根廷议会于八月提出了取缔共产党的法案。巴西政府于八月二十一日下令缺席审判共产党总书记普列斯特及共产党其他领袖。危地马拉政府也因为共产党的报纸《十月》曾谴责美国在朝鲜进行侵略，加以封闭。哥斯达黎加政府八月逮捕了总工会总书记海明纳斯，并判处长期监禁。
    拉丁美洲各国人民对于各该政府这种迎合美国帝国主义战争政策的反动措施，以扩大和平签名运动和反对美国帝国主义战争政策表示了他们的有力反对。在严密警察统治下的阿根廷，签名于斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的人数，八月下旬就已超过了一百万。在只有人口五百多万的智利，魏地拉法西斯化统治与镇压也遏止不了人民拥护和平的运动，和平签名已达十二万人。在报纸揭穿了美国大使无耻压迫出兵支持侵略朝鲜战争行为的乌拉圭，数千劳动人民于本月十四日在美国大使馆门前举行示威，高呼“反对战争”的口号，要求撤退朝鲜境内帝国主义干涉军。智利八月底也发生类似的人民示威行动。
