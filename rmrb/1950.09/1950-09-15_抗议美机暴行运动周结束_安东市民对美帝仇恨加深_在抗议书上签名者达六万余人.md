　　Xinhua News Agency, Antung, 13th. During the week-long movement to protest the American aircraft's massacre of our compatriots, the 270,000 citizens of Antung City further deepened their hatred for the aggressive atrocities of American imperialism. The movement week ran from the 4th to the 10th. Throughout the week, the city launched various forms of propaganda against American aggression. The main streets of the urban area were filled with huge banners and cartoons, and many shops and residents' windows were plastered with slogans such as "Smash the conspiracy of American imperialist provocations" and "Resolutely avenge the compatriots who died." Propaganda teams composed of workers and students took to the streets every day. The 220 propagandists sent by the Antung All-Circles Anti-American Movement Committee went deep into the streets of the city, organized symposiums, and conducted extensive propaganda. According to preliminary statistics, 66,191 citizens signed the joint protest letter. After extensive and in-depth propaganda, the citizens further recognized the aggressive face of American imperialism. Many people said: "Now we can see the true face of the American devils. They dare to stretch the claws of aggression against Korea over our heads. We must cut them off."

　　Since the 4th, all factories, institutions, schools, and organizations throughout the city have not only spent one and a half hours each day studying Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and major newspaper commentaries, but also held protest rallies. The state-owned Antung Paper Mill held a general staff protest rally of more than 1,700 people. At the meeting, worker representatives from various workshops took to the stage to speak, unanimously expressing their determination to increase national strength and combat the aggressive behavior of American imperialism with practical actions to complete the September production tasks ahead of schedule. Nie Zhongyi, the representative of the factory selected to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, said at the meeting: "I guarantee that our wooden autoclave room (the department for steaming and cooking paper materials) will increase the proportion of first-class products from 80% to 90% in September."

　　On the morning of the 8th, more than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in the city held a protest rally to denounce the crimes of the American aggressors. In the afternoon, leaders from the provincial and municipal party and government organs and people's organizations formed a joint comfort group to visit the injured at the Liaodong Provincial Hospital and the Antung Municipal Hospital.

　　During the week, people from all walks of life in Antung City also went to comfort the injured. The injured compatriots also received hundreds of letters of sympathy from all over the country every day. They said to the comforters with emotion: "Thank you for the concern of the compatriots across the country. We will work hard after we are discharged from the hospital to repay everyone's condolences."

    在抗议书上签名者达六万余人
    【新华社安东十三日电】安东市二十七万市民在抗议美机残杀我国同胞运动周中进一步加深了对美帝国主义侵略暴行的仇恨。运动周自四日起至十日结束。一周内全市展开了反对美国侵略的各种宣传。市区各主要街道布满了巨幅标语和漫画，很多商店和居民的门窗上也都贴着“粉碎美帝国主义挑衅阴谋”，“坚决为死难同胞报仇”等标语。工人学生所组成的宣传队连日出动街头。安东各界抗议运动委员会派出的二百二十名宣传员分别深入全市各街道，组织座谈会，进行广泛宣传。市民们在联名抗议书上签名者，据初步统计，已达六万六千一百九十一人。在进行了广泛和深入的宣传后，市民们更进一步认识了美帝国主义的侵略面目。许多人说：“这下我们可看清了美国鬼子的嘴脸。他们竟敢把侵略朝鲜的毛爪伸到我们的头上来。我们一定要把它砍断。”
    自四日开始，全市所有工厂、机关、学校及各团体除每日以一小时半的时间学习周外长声明及各大报刊评论外，并分别举行了抗议集会。国营安东造纸厂曾举行一千七百余人的全体职工抗议大会。会上各车间工人代表纷纷登台讲话，一致表示要以提前完成九月份生产任务的实际行动，增加国家力量，打击美帝国主义的侵略行为。该厂被选为出席全国工农兵劳动模范大会代表的聂忠义在会上说：“我保证我们木釜室（蒸煮纸料部门）在九月份把一等产品由百分之八十提高至百分之九十。”
    八日上午，全市各界人民代表千余人举行抗议大会，控诉美国侵略者的罪行。下午，省市党政机关及人民团体负责人组成联合慰问团，分赴辽东省立医院及安东市立医院向受伤者进行慰问。
    一周来安东市各界人民亦纷纷前往慰问受伤者。受伤同胞每日并收到成百封来自各地的慰问信，他们向慰问者感动地说：“谢谢全国同胞的关怀，我们出院后一定努力工作，来报答大家的慰问。”
