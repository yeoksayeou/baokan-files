　　From Child Bride to People's Hero
    ——Introducing the Heroic Female Worker Li Fenglian
    Guo Yong
  Participated in the Revolution at Fourteen

    Li Fenglian is only thirty years old this year. Since joining the revolution sixteen years ago, she has been working actively and serving the people wholeheartedly every day. Initially, when working in the printing factory, she performed well in all aspects and was selected as a model woman. As a bookbinder, she ranked first in quality and quantity, and was selected as a labor hero of the entire factory; she also received awards for participating in shock brigades to reclaim wasteland on the mountains. In the clothing factory, she was selected as a first-class labor hero in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region; as a nanny in the nursery, she also achieved remarkable results and received the glorious title of "Labor Hero and Revolutionary Good Wife and Mother" from the Central Workers' Committee.

    However, in her own words, the biggest difficulty in her work was her low level of education.

    As a child, she was a child bride in a landlord's family, eating food worse than pig slop, suffering beatings and abuse. Naturally, she had no chance to go to school.

    She joined the revolution at the age of fourteen. Whenever she had free time, she would study to learn characters. In less than a year, she learned more than 300 characters. Because she was consistently active in her work and made rapid progress, she quickly participated in the work of the Party and the Trade Union. But the biggest difficulty was that her education level could not keep up with the needs of her work. However, when working in the factory, there were many people who were illiterate, so she was not too worried.

  Better Work with Education

    In the winter of 1947, she was honorably elected as a worker representative of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to attend the Sixth Labor Congress.

    After the Labor Congress, a delegation was to be sent abroad, and she was also assigned to participate. Later, because Shenyang was liberated, the organization wanted her to stay. When asked for her opinion, she said, "I have no opinion. Wherever you need me, I will go!" A responsible comrade from the receiving party in Shenyang, Comrade Ma, said to her, "The Party has high hopes for you and wants to give you a new task—there is a factory that wants you to work there, and it is estimated that you will definitely be able to complete the task!" After she agreed, she asked, "How many people are going?" Comrade Ma said, "There is a shortage of cadres, just you." She asked, "To work? Or as a working member?" Comrade Ma said, "To take over, as a military representative. Are there any difficulties?" She said nothing, "Just that my education level is too low." Comrade Ma said, "It doesn't matter, the Party believes in you." Thus, with a few words, she accepted the task and led two guard platoons and one clerk to go.

    The clothing factory in her mind seemed to be the same as the clothing factory in Yan'an: at most two or three hundred people, but she never expected them to say, "The factory is not big, but there are two or three thousand people."

    She had just come out of the mountains, wearing rural clothes. Entering such a big city as a military representative, the people in the factory looked down on her, calling her a "bumpkin." At that time, the staff and workers did not understand our Party, and the environment was quite complicated. Many people pretended to be progressive to her, but with her wisdom, she always maintained contact with the workers and masses, and she was able to distinguish them clearly without being deceived, and she established prestige among the masses.

    As the work deepened day by day, more and more problems were discovered. She found that the factory had not paid workers' salaries for three months, which was a major problem. If it could be resolved, it would be a key issue in stabilizing workers' lives and production morale. Why hadn't the salaries been paid? This required checking the accounts. But how could she check the accounts if she was illiterate? She was determined to overcome this difficulty.

    Every day, she would go deep into the workshops to understand the situation and tell stories to the staff and workers; at night, she would check the accounts, always staying up until midnight. She would write down any unfamiliar characters she encountered. One day, two days, three days… finally, she found out: the staff embezzled the workers' wages. The problem was solved, the workers' morale was high, and the staff were convinced.

    She stayed in the clothing factory for half a year. Although her body became thinner due to overwork, she overcame all difficulties. The factory achieved excellent results in terms of quantity, quality, economy, culture, and life. However, she was not proud and complacent about these achievements, and always said, "If I were educated, the work would be done even better!"

  At Renmin University

    From a child bride to a people's hero, escaping from a landlord's family to join the revolution, from the people's capital, she flew in an airplane to the bastion of world peace and democracy - Moscow. What a tortuous process this is! "The Party has put so much effort into cultivating me! How much the Party values me! How important my responsibility is!" Comrade Li Fenglian often thinks this way. "How much could I have done for the Party if I had been literate? How far am I from the Party's expectations!"

    "In order to improve my cultural and theoretical level, so that I can do more work for the Party in the future, I should go to school!"

    This suggestion was adopted by the organization, and on February 7th of this year, she entered the Factory Management Department of the Renmin University of China to study.

    Because the courses were too deep, the school established a "Cultural Remedial Class" for comrades with low education levels, and Comrade Li Fenglian was also assigned to the remedial class.

    Compared with others in the remedial class, she had three particular difficulties: first, out of the two or three hundred people in the class, her cultural foundation was worse than anyone else's; second, she frequently had meetings to attend both on and off campus—because she served as a member of the Party General Branch and Branch Committee on campus, and off campus, she was a member of the Political Consultative Conference and an executive member of the All-China Women's Federation. Third, she was often sick, and the time she could actually spend studying at school was limited. She was not intimidated by these many difficulties. Obviously, she could only work harder.

    She did not take a nap every day, always hunched over her desk doing exercises and writing new characters; she did not eat breakfast in the morning, to study for an extra half hour. Her classmates were worried about her health and advised her to take a nap and eat breakfast, she said, "It doesn't matter if young people don't take a nap, not eating breakfast has become a habit." Sometimes her classmates would confiscate her books, close the door, and drive her to eat. But even without books, she had a way. Seeing a basin, she would ask people, "How do you write the character 'basin'?" Seeing a bowl, she would ask, "How do you write the character 'bowl'?"

    Despite her low education level and many difficulties, she still helped others at all times. On Sundays, she studied together with the students who stayed at school for remedial classes. In addition to insisting on studying herself to influence others, she also used the method of having others dictate to promote group study. In the past, everyone dictated to themselves, and progress was not great, but with this method, everyone's morale was boosted!

    On the evening of July 30th, after watching the film "Gorky's Childhood," she was greatly stimulated. She wrote in her diary: "Comrade Gorky had never gone to school since childhood, but with his hard work, he became a world-famous writer. With such good conditions, can I still not study hard?" Lying in bed, she thought for two or three hours, and then made a study plan: keep a diary and read the newspaper every day, and write down any unfamiliar characters to look up in the dictionary; she used to be afraid of arithmetic, but now she is determined to overcome it. And she issued a challenge condition to a comrade with a low level of education, to compete in learning.

    Now, although she participates in work and studies at the same time, she can still keep up with the class. In terms of composition, when she first entered school, she would write fifty or sixty characters, with one or twenty mistakes, but now she can write a hundred or so characters, and only find five or six mistakes. She has already learned multi-digit multiplication in arithmetic, and she can also do simple division.

    Why is it that she has a poor foundation, is often sick, and has many things to do outside, but can still achieve such good results? Both the Chinese teacher and the arithmetic teacher answered in unison: "Because of her tenacity." If you ask further, why can she persevere so tenaciously in her studies? It is very obvious that Comrade Li Fenglian is an outstanding Communist Party member, and the Party hopes that she will do more work in the future. In a word, she understands why she needs to study.

    In terms of life, Li Fenglian is the big sister of the classmates.

    The reporter visited more than a dozen classmates in the remedial class, wanting to ask them to talk about their feelings about Comrade Li Fenglian. They all seemed to have discussed it beforehand and said, "Anyway, we all think she is very good, but we can't describe how good she is, we can only call her Sister Li!" Yes, Comrade Li Fenglian is indeed like a big sister. She does not care about her own life, but she takes care of others very thoughtfully everywhere. She is sick for two or three days and does not say anything, insisting on going to class until she faints and becomes unconscious before being sent to the hospital. The doctor said, "She is overusing her brain!" If a comrade is sick, no matter how busy she is, she will take the time to visit, help take care of everything for the patient, ask for leave, ask for a doctor, and check the patient's meal. When going out early in the morning, she urges her comrades to add clothes; when sleeping at night, she checks to see if anyone has not covered themselves properly. Comrade Yue Jinwei said, "In short, she is very concerned about everyone's affairs and has no personal interests at all."

    When Comrade Li Fenglian fainted and became unconscious that time, many classmates cried. After she went to the hospital, the classmates missed her all the time, as if something was missing from the school. Although the hospital was far away, everyone had to run to see her.

  An Old Soldier

    Comrade Li Fenglian never relaxes her high vigilance against the enemy in any environment, and she has shown this at school. The school director said, "She often pays attention to suspicious things and reports them to the organization, and these things are often overlooked by many people." One night, she returned very late, and the teachers and students of the school had already fallen asleep. She wanted to call the gatekeeper to open the door, but as soon as she pushed, the door opened, and the comrade at the gatehouse was sleeping soundly, not noticing that someone had entered. The comrade who came back with her didn't think anything of it, but she felt that this problem was worth paying attention to. The next day, she strictly criticized the gatekeeper, saying, "The enemy is not resting, so why should we rest? Our school is a place where cadres are concentrated, and we should protect these Party cadres well, we should be vigilant in case of emergency." After all, she is a battle-hardened old soldier!

　　从童养媳到人民英雄
    ——介绍女工英雄李凤莲
    国涌
  十四岁参加革命
    李凤莲，今年才三十岁。参加革命十六年以来，没有一天不是积极工作，忠心为人民服务。最初，在印刷厂工作时，各方面都表现很好，当选过模范妇女。她作装订工，质量数量数第一，当选过全厂的劳动英雄；参加突击队上山开荒，也得过奖。在被服厂又被选为陕甘宁边区一级工厂劳动英雄；在托儿所里当保姆，又是成绩卓著，得到了中央工委“劳动英雄又是革命的贤妻良母”的光荣的称号。
    可是在她说来，工作中有个最大的困难——文化水平太低。
    她小时候当过地主家的童养媳，吃的饭不如猪食，挨打受气过时光，上学校读书自然是没有她的份儿。
    她十四岁的那年就参加了革命，一有空就学习认字，不到一年的光景就认了三百多字，因为工作一贯积极，进步快，很快她就参加了党和工会的工作。但最大的困难，就是文化程度跟不上工作的需要。不过，在厂子里工作时，不识字的人顶多，她还不怎么样着急。
  有文化工作会作得更好
    一九四七年冬天，她光荣地当选了陕甘宁边区出席第六次劳动大会的工人代表。
    劳大以后，要派代表团出国，她也被派参加。后来因为沈阳解放了，组织上要她留下。征求她意见时，她说：“没有什么意见，需要我到那里，我就到那里去！”接管沈阳的一位负责人马同志向她说：“党对你希望很大，想给你一个新的任务——有个工厂要派你去工作，估计你一定能完成任务！”她答应了以后问：“去几个人？”马同志说：“干部很缺，就你一人。”她问：“作工呢？当工作员呢？”马同志说：“去接管，当军事代表。有什么困难吗？”她说没有什么，只是我的文化太低。”马同志说：“没关系，党相信你。”就这样三言两语接受了任务，带领了两个警卫班，一个公务员就去了。
    她脑子里想的被服厂，似乎还和延安的被服厂一样：顶多二、三百人，可真没想到人家说：“厂子不大，有两三千人。”
    她才从山里边出来，穿的农村服装，进了这样大的城市当军事代表，工厂里的人都看不起她，说她是“土包子”。当时，职工们对我党没有认识，环境相当复杂，不少人向她伪装进步，但凭着她的智慧，和工人群众始终保持联系，都辨别清楚了，一点也没上当，且在群众中树立起威信来。
    工作一天天的深入了，问题越发现的多了。她发现厂方三个月没给工人发薪，是当前的大问题，如果能解决了，对安定工人生活和生产情绪是个关键问题。为什么没发薪呢？这必须要查账。不识字又怎么查账呢？她下定决心要克服这个困难。
    每天，白天他就深入车间了解情况，给职工们上课，讲故事；晚间就查账，总是半夜不睡。遇到不认识的生字就记下来。一天，两天，三天……终于查清楚了：职员们把工人的工资分了脏。问题解决了，工人情绪高了，职员们服劲了。
    在被服厂呆了半年，虽然因为工作过分劳累，身体也瘦了，但一切困难也被她战胜了。该厂在数量、质量、节约、文化、生活上都得到了优良的成绩。可是，她不为这些成绩而骄傲自满，总是说：“假如自己有文化的话，工作会做得更好一些！”
  在人民大学
    从一个童养媳妇成为一个人民的英雄，从一个地主家庭逃出来参加革命，从人民的首都，又坐上飞机到过世界和平民主的堡垒——莫斯科。这是一个多么曲折的过程呀！“党为了培养自己，下了多大的力量呀！党如何的重视自己呀！自己的责任如何重大呀！”李凤莲同志经常这样的想。“自己不认字，能为党作了多少事情？离党的希望有多远呀！”
    “为着提高自己的文化、理论水平，今后更能为党多作些工作，还是进学校去吧！”
    这个意见被组织上采纳了，今年二月七日她进了中国人民大学工厂管理系学习。
    因为课程太深，学校又为文化低的同志们成立了“文化补习班”，李凤莲同志也编进补习班。
    在补习班里，比起别人来，她有三个特别的困难：第一，全班二、三百人，她的文化基础比谁都差；第二，校内校外经常有她出席的会议——因为她在校内担任党总支委员，支部委员，校外是政治协商会委员，全国妇联执行委员。第三，她病多，真正能在学校里学习的时间有限，这样多的困难他没有被吓倒。很明显的，只有加倍努力。
    她每天不睡午觉，总是爬在桌子上作练习题、写生字；早上不吃饭，多学半个钟头。同学们都耽心她的健康，劝她睡午觉、吃早饭，她说：“年青人不睡午觉没有什么关系，不吃早饭已经成了习惯。”同学们有时把她的书没收了，关了门子，撵她去吃饭。可是没有书她也有办法，见盆子就问人：“盆字怎么写？”见了碗就问“碗字怎么写”？
    尽管她文化低，困难多，可是她还时刻帮助别人。星期日她和留校补习的同学一起，除自己坚持学习影响别人外，还用让别人默写的方法，推进小组学习。过去各人自己默写，进步不大，这么一来，大家情绪高起来了！
    七月三十日晚上，看了一部《高尔基幼年时代》的电影，对她刺激很大，她在日记上写道：“高尔基同志，从小没念过书，凭他艰苦奋斗，成了世界上著名的作家，自己这样好的条件还能不好好学习吗？”躺在床上，想了两三个钟头，就订了学习计划：每天记日记、看报纸，遇有生字就记下来查字典；过去对算术总是害怕，下定决心克服。并且向一位文化低的同志提出了挑战条件，要在学习上竞赛。
    现在，尽管她一面参加工作一面学习，可是她还能跟得上班。作文方面，入学时写五、六十个字，总有一、二十个错字，现在写百十个字，才只能发现五、六个错字。算术已经学到多位乘法，简单除法也会了。
    为什么她基础差，又经常病，外面事又多，还能得到这样好的成绩呢？国文教员与算术教员都异口同声的回答：“凭着她的顽强。”假如追问一下，为什么她能这样顽强的坚持学习呢？那明显得很，因为李凤莲同志是一个优秀的共产党员，党希望她将来作更多的工作。一句话，她明白为什么要学习。
    在生活方面，李凤莲却是同学们的老大姐。
    记者到补习班里访问了十多位同学，想请他们谈一下对于李凤莲同志的感觉。他们好像都事先商量过了一样说：“反正我们都觉得她很好，怎么好，我们也形容不来，我们只好叫她李大姐！”是的，李凤莲同志确实像个大姐，她对自己的生活并不关心，对别人却是处处关照得很周到。她病了两三天也不说，硬要坚持上课，直到昏倒不省人事了才被送到医院，医生说：“她是用脑子过度了！”假如有一个同志病了，她再怎么忙也要抽空去看看，帮助料理病人的一切，替他请假、请医生，还要检查病号饭，清早出去，她就催促同志们加衣服；晚间睡觉，他要看看是不是有人没盖好被子。岳金维同志说：“总之，她对大家的事非常关心，个人的利益一点也没有。”
    当李凤莲同志那次昏倒不省人事的时候，许多同学都哭了。她到医院后，同学们时时想念她，好像学校里少了一件什么似的，虽然医院很远，大家也要跑去看她。
  一个老战士
    李凤莲同志在任何环境里都不放松对敌人的高度的警惕性，在学校里也表现出来了。校主任说：“她经常注意一些可以怀疑的事情向组织上汇报，而且这些事情往往都是不少的人忽略的。”有一个夜里，她在外面回来很晚，学校师生早已睡了，她想叫门房起来开门，可是刚一推，大门就开了，门房的同志睡得正甜，一点也没发觉有人进来。和她一起回来的同志觉得没有什么，她却觉得这个问题很值得注意，第二天，就严格地向门房提出了批评，他说：“敌人还没有休息，我们就休息吗？我们学校是干部集中的地方，我们应该好好的保护这些党的干部，我们应该提高警惕，以防万一”。到底是个久经锻炼的老战士！
