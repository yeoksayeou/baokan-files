Supporting Farmers in Autumn Planting
Shandong Decides to Issue Huge Agricultural Loans

[Reported by this newspaper] To support farmers in autumn planting, the Shandong Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China has prepared to issue loans of 50 to 60 million catties of wheat throughout the province. The characteristics of this loan are that it is mainly issued in currency, with a portion handled in the form of wheat seeds and bean cakes, or cash discounts for in-kind loans. The designated uses are to support farmers in applying more fertilizer, preventing and controlling pests, and exchanging for improved varieties. The loan distribution includes 40,490,000 catties for fertilizer loans, 9,810,000 catties for seed loans, and 5,100,000 catties for pesticides.

In order to ensure that this loan accurately meets needs and is used appropriately, the bank has instructed various localities to pay attention to the following during loan disbursement: For loan distribution areas, focus on areas that have undergone land reform, have better mass organizations, higher production enthusiasm, more wheat planting in the plains, or areas that have suffered more from diseases such as wheat smut, rust, insect pests, hail, and floods, as well as areas where the masses are accustomed to applying fertilizer, using pesticides, and lack seeds or need to build water conservancy for irrigation. Loans should be distributed according to actual needs. For example, in areas affected by wheat smut, with fertilization habits, and water conservancy irrigation, fertilizer loans should be the main focus. In areas with water, drought, hail, and rust disasters, wheat seed loans should be the main focus. Pesticides should be mainly distributed in areas prone to insect pests. In terms of work control and requirements, the first step is to prepare materials and ideology. To adapt to the new situation of stable prices and promote the use of RMB in rural areas, the agricultural loan material funds should be converted into currency in a planned manner, and efforts should be made to sell grain to allocate funds. County banks should also convene loan officer meetings to emphasize clarifying policies, explaining methods, and paying attention to overcoming the relief mentality that exists in the minds of some cadres. In loan disbursement, special attention should be paid to encouraging model production organizations among the masses, so that loan household groups are combined with production organizations. And pay attention to preventing blindness in loans. In order to fully supply farmers with necessary means of production, and at the same time avoid market competition and price increases after currency loans are issued, local banks must take the initiative to closely cooperate with relevant departments, organize cooperatives and private oil workshops according to the needs of local farmers, and coordinate to achieve a comprehensive solution. In areas with a good foundation of cooperatives, better cooperatives should be selected to handle loans. However, in the minds of cadres, the utilitarian view of cooperatives should be prevented. Agreements should be signed under the principle of mutual benefit to clarify responsibilities and actively provide assistance.

The instructions concluded that agricultural loan work is a regular and complex task, so leading cadres must deeply understand the situation and solve problems in a timely manner; and pay attention to absorbing new experiences in order to gradually improve.

　　扶植农民进行秋种
    山东决发放巨额农贷
    【本报讯】为扶助农民进行秋种，中国人民银行山东省行已准备在全省发放五千万至六千万斤小麦的贷款。此项贷款的特点是以货币贷放为主，部分以麦种、豆饼、贷实折现方式办理。确定用途为扶持农民多施肥、防除虫害及调换优良品种。贷款分配计肥料贷款四千零四十九万斤，种籽贷款九百八十一万斤，农药五百一十万斤。
    为使此项贷款能够确合需要、用得适当，该行曾指示各地在贷放中应注意：对贷款分配地区，着重经过土改、群众组织较好、生产情绪较高、平原地带种麦较多，或因遭受腥乌、疸、虫、雹、水等灾情较重地区，以及群众习惯施肥，使用农药与缺乏种籽及需要兴修水利灌溉地区。贷款应按实际需要分配，如在遭受乌麦、有施肥习惯和水利灌溉地区应以肥料贷款为主，在有水、旱、雹、疸灾地区应以贷放麦种为主，农药应在易遭受虫灾地区为主。在工作掌握与要求上，首先要做好物资与思想准备工作。为适应物价稳定的新情况，配合推动人民币下乡，应将农贷实物资金有计划地转为货币，抓紧卖粮调配资金。各县银行并应召开贷款员会议，着重讲清政策、说明办法，并注意克服某些干部思想中存在的救济观点。在贷放中尤应注意鼓励群众中的模范生产组织，使贷户小组与生产组织结合起来。并注意防止贷款中的盲目性。为了充分供应农民必要之生产资料，同时避免在货币贷放后引起市场上争购抬价，各地银行必须主动与各有关部门取得密切配合，根据当地农民需要，组织合作社、私人油坊，进行调剂，达到统盘解决。在合作社基础较好地区应选择较好的合作社办理贷放。但在干部思想上，应防止对合作社的使用观点，应在两利原则下，订立协议，明确责任，并主动予以帮助。
    指示最后指出：农贷工作是一个经常而复杂的工作，故必须领导干部深入了解情况，及时解决问题；并注意吸取新的经验以便逐步提高。
