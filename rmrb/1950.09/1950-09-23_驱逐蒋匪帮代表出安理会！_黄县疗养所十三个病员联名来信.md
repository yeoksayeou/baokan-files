    Expel the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang's Representative from the Security Council!
    ——Joint Letter from Thirteen Patients at the Huang County Sanatorium

    Editor:
    We thirteen people are all patients at the Huang County Sanatorium in the Laiyang Special District of Shandong. We express our extreme anger at the barbaric and shameless behavior of the American imperialist elements and the representative of the Kuomintang reactionaries' remnant group, Jiang Tingfu, in the Security Council. We oppose the American imperialist aggressors who provoke war and undermine world peace, oppose the U.S. imperialist aggression against our territory of Taiwan and the U.S. planes' violation of our country's airspace, and resolutely demand that the U.S. imperialist stooge, the representative of the remnant Kuomintang reactionary clique, Jiang Tingfu, be expelled from the Security Council!
    China is the China of the Chinese people, and the representative of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China should participate in the Security Council. Honorary soldier Ning Yuntai said: "Jiang Tingfu, this bastard, really infuriated me; the public enemy of the Chinese people has the audacity to say that he is the representative of China. China's territory of Taiwan is suffering from U.S. imperialist aggression, and U.S. planes are violating Chinese airspace, killing Chinese compatriots, while Jiang Tingfu shamelessly defends the U.S. imperialist aggression, fully revealing his true colors as a U.S. imperialist lackey. Can such a guy represent China?"
    We deeply realize that the behavior of U.S. imperialism in provoking war and undermining world peace cannot scare the incomparably powerful peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. The aggressive atrocities of U.S. imperialists have been exposed before the people of the world, and peace-loving and democratic people have long recognized their ferocious faces. Patient Chen Xing-san said: "The U.S. military's armed aggression against Korea and the violation of our airspace, killing our compatriots, show that U.S. imperialism is taking the path to death of Japanese fascism." We are not afraid of American imperialists. Under the wise leadership of our great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese Communist Party, we have already defeated the ferocious Japanese imperialists and overthrown the U.S. imperialist stooge, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. We have rich experience in struggle and have the confidence to defeat any imperialist aggression and provocation.
    We have already signed the peace book, and we guarantee to concentrate on treatment and recuperation, and after recovering from our illnesses, we will resolutely serve the people better in various work posts. We are determined to dedicate everything we have to liberate Taiwan and Tibet, defend the motherland, and defend world peace!

    Patients of Huang County Sanatorium, Laiyang Special District: Chen Xing-san, Wang Yunzai, Dong Shumin, Ning Yuntai, Lü Huashan, Wang Bo, Zhu Chengheng, Ding Xuekao, Sun Qingyu, Fan Bingjin, Diao Hongxiu, Li Jingtang, Huang Hecai.

　　驱逐蒋匪帮代表出安理会！
    ——黄县疗养所十三个病员联名来信编辑同志：
    我们十三个人都是山东莱阳专区黄县疗养所的病员。我们对于美国帝国主义分子和国民党反动派残余集团的代表蒋廷黻在安理会的横蛮无耻行为，表示极大的愤恨。我们反对挑拨战争、破坏世界和平的美帝国主义侵略者，反对美帝侵略我国领土台湾与美机侵犯我国领空的暴行，并坚决要求把美帝的走狗国民党反动集团残余分子的代表蒋廷黻驱逐出安理会！
    中国是中国人民的中国，应该让中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表参加安理会。荣誉军人宁运泰说：“蒋廷黻这混蛋真把我气坏了；中国人民的公敌却厚颜无耻地说他是中国代表。中国的领土台湾遭受美帝侵略，美机侵犯中国领空，残杀中国同胞，而蒋廷黻无耻地为美帝的侵略罪行狡辩，充分显露了美帝走狗的原形。这样的家伙能够代表中国吗？”
    我们深刻认识到美帝挑拨战争、破坏世界和平的行为，是吓不倒以苏联为首的强大无比的和平民主阵营的。美帝国主义者的侵略暴行已暴露在全世界人民的面前，爱好和平民主的人们早已认识了他们的穷凶恶极的面孔。病员陈星三说：“美军武装侵略朝鲜，并侵犯我领空，残杀我同胞，美帝正在走日本法西斯的死亡道路。”我们并不怕美国帝国主义者，我们在伟大中国人民领袖毛主席及中国共产党的英明领导下，过去已经战胜了凶恶的日本帝国主义，打垮了美帝走狗蒋介石匪帮。我们有了丰富的斗争经验，有信心击败任何一个帝国主义者的侵略挑衅。
    我们已在和平书上签了名，我们保证安心治病和休养，待病痊愈后，坚决在各种工作岗位上更好地为人民服务。我们决心为解放台湾、西藏，保卫祖国、保卫世界和平，供献自己的一切！
    莱阳专区黄县疗养所病员陈星三、王云在、董述民、宁运泰、吕华山、王波、朱承恒、丁学考、孙清郁、范秉金、刁鸿秀、李景堂、黄和才。
