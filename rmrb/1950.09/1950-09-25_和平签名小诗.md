Poem for Peace Signatures
    The peasants of Binyang County, Guangxi Province, enthusiastically participated in the peace signature campaign. The farmers' association of Zhenyang Village in the county wrote a poem on the signature book, expressing their will to defend peace:

      "American imperialism's ambitions are rampant,
      Wanting to enslave the whole world;
      Manipulating and controlling the Security Council,
      Violating the United Nations Charter.
      Armed aggression against the Korean people,
      And also invading our Taiwan.
      We quickly come to sign our names,
      To stop American imperialism's rampant madness."

　　和平签名小诗
    广西宾阳县农民踊跃参加和平签名运动，该县镇阳村的农民协会在签名册上写着一首诗，表示他们保卫和平的意志：
      “美帝侵略野心狂，
      想把世界奴化光；
      操纵把持安理会，
      违背联合国宪章。
      武装进攻朝鲜人，
      又来侵略我台湾。
      我们赶紧来签名，
      制止美帝逞凶狂。”
