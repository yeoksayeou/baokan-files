Xinhua News Agency, Istanbul, September 16th: Regarding reports of Iranian government troops and the Kurdish people of Zawin Rud, fighting for more than a week in the area 100 kilometers northwest of Kermanshah (Iran), Iranian newspapers are drawing attention to the recent "tour" of Iran by US Supreme Court Justice Douglas, organized by the US General Staff. Douglas "visited" Kurdistan, Luristan, and the towns of Mahabad and Senendej.

According to news from the "Bisui Ayandi Newspaper," modern American weapons were seized from the people of Zawin Rud. It is estimated that the American weapons were transported to these tribes through Palestine. In a special article commenting on the conflict between the Kurdish people and government troops, the newspaper stated: "Now we can see the results of Douglas's trip. The current tension is the result of US-British colonial policy. No matter what the Americans and British are pursuing in our country, they bring to the Iranian people only the plunder of their national wealth, bloodshed, and internecine strife." The newspaper concluded: "Now we also know the meaning of the stay of US Ambassador to Iran, Grady, and Douglas in our country. Now we declare: the Americans are responsible for the events in Zawin Rud."

　　美帝煽动伊朗人民自相残杀
    伊政府军与古的族开火
    《比苏·阿扬第报》指出目前紧张局势是美英殖民政策的结果
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社伊斯坦堡十六日讯：关于伊朗政府军队和扎温鲁德地方的古的族，在基尔曼沙（伊朗）西北一百公里的地方战斗了一个多星期的消息，伊朗报纸唤起人们注意由美国参谋本部所组织的美国最高法院法官道格拉斯最近“游历”伊朗一事。道格拉斯曾经“访问”古的斯坦和卢里斯坦以及麦哈巴德和塞宁德伊两城镇。
    据《比苏·阿扬第报》消息：从扎温鲁德人手里卤获了现代化的美国武器。据估计美国武器是通过巴勒斯坦运到这些部落去的。该报在评论古的族和政府军队冲突的专文中称：“现在可以看到道格拉斯旅行的结果了。目前的紧张局势是美英殖民政策的结果。不管美英两国人在我国追求什么，带给伊朗人民的只有掠夺他们国家的财富、流血和自相残杀的争夺。”该报在结语中称：“我们现在也知道美国驻伊朗大使格拉第和道格拉斯在我国逗留的意义了。现在我们宣布：美国人对扎温鲁德的事件是要负责的。”
