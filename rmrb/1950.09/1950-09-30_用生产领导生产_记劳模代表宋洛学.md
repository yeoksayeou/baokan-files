　　Leading Production with Production
    ——A Record of Labor Model Representative Song Luoxue
    Song Luoxue is from Songjia Village, Mancheng County, Hebei Province. He is a member of the Communist Party and is 43 years old this year. In his youth, he worked as a porter and a short-term worker. Later, he opened his own greenhouse and farmed. From 1941 to 1946, he served as the director of the village farmers' association and the director of the cooperative. In 1949, he served as a member of the industry committee. In January 1950, he was elected as a representative to the county's all-circles representative conference and a member of the county people's government. In addition, since 1942, he has been a member of the Party branch of Songjia Village. This time he was elected as a representative to the National Congress of Labor Model Workers, Peasants and Soldiers.
  Leading Production with Production
    Song Luoxue is not only a hard-working and productive expert, but also a model cadre for organizing the masses to become prosperous.
    In July 1949, he was elected as a model Communist Party member and first-class labor model in the county. In November, he was elected as a representative to the county party congress. At the meeting, he said: "Some people say that being a cadre delays production, but I feel that production and work are not well coordinated. Whenever work is assigned, I don't procrastinate at all. I work in the fields during the day and attend meetings at night, and I complete it quickly. I have become rich as a cadre, mainly because I feel that production is the most important work that overrides everything; I feel that if I don't do a good job in production myself, I won't be able to lead production."
    In the past, Songjia Village had no habit of growing peanuts. In the spring of 1949, the government called for planting peanuts. The masses said: "Our village has black-yellow soil and cannot be planted." Song Luoxue had confidence in his heart and quietly borrowed hundreds of catties of peanut seeds from the district and planted three mu first. Then he said to the masses: "Do you all remember! In the second year of the incident, I carried peanut seeds from Gaojing Village south of the railway and planted three fen, and harvested 150 catties, which is more than the yield of one mu of grain." The masses were convinced by this fact, and the whole village planted a total of 47 mu. In autumn, the harvest was really good, yielding more than 500 catties per mu, which could be exchanged for 600 catties of rice. He himself paid off 340 catties of public grain with half a mu of peanuts.
  Actively Leading the Improvement of Technology
    He learned the "two openings and one cooling" warm water soaking method. This soaking method has been tested for several years, and the seedlings always emerge early and strong without getting miscellaneous diseases. Last spring sowing, he helped the masses soak more than 180 mu of seeds. In August, the millet that was not soaked in the village grew black jaundice, and the soaked ears of millet were heavy. Under the influence of this fact, 80% of the one thousand mu of wheat in the village were soaked in autumn.
    With the help of Luoxue, the masses of Songjia Village began to be interested in improving technology and introducing fine varieties. Before the Grain Rain this year, more than 6,000 catties of cotton seeds in the village were selected by grain. After the cotton was sown, there was a heavy rain, and the cotton field became stiff. Although the masses rushed to dig, more than 120 mu of seedlings were not fully emerged. In order to ensure that the fine variety was pure and not supplemented with a single hybrid, Song Luoxue took 130 catties of Si Zi 2B cotton seeds from the farm and filled all the missing seedlings. When carrying out weeding work, he first mobilized at the mass meeting. He and all the cadres took the lead in hoeing the ground. Under their influence, the 880 mu of cotton fields in the village were generally weeded in seven or eight days. Later, cotton aphids were found in the cotton fields, so he personally went to the farm to get rotenone powder and sprayers, and went to Mancheng City to buy soap for preparing medicine. He first treated his own four mu. In less than four or five days, the masses followed his example and treated 140 mu.
    In order to promote the introduction of foreign potatoes (sweet potatoes), Song Luoxue and several village cadres made a large kang, ordered seed potatoes from the farm, cultivated more than 40 seedlings, and sold them to farmers at low prices, promoting more than 200 mu. At the same time, under the influence of Luoxue, more than 30 households in the village planted six mu (Rural No. 4, Victory No. 100, Protector, Thin Vine, Purple Vine, Gourd Fruit) of different foreign potatoes respectively for cultivation experiments and comparisons.
    Because of his spirit of delving into technology, he was elected as the technical team leader of six villages in the cotton fine seed area. In each production link, he took the initiative to convene joint village technical team meetings to study and solve technical promotion problems.
  Organize
    The mutual aid groups in Songjia Village only started to be organized this year. Under the leadership of the village branch, four branch members were the backbone, and each organized a mutual aid group. Song Luoxue first organized four households, with a total of 76 mu of land, six male laborers, four female laborers, and two donkeys. In the work of pulling soil to transport adobe, farming, pulling wheat, etc., 20 workdays were saved. This not only overcame the difficulty of insufficient labor and livestock power, but also squeezed out time to engage in sideline businesses, opening a wood factory to earn two dan and nine dou of rice, and selling piglets to earn more than one dan of rice. This fact made the masses realize the direction of organizing to become prosperous. During the wheat harvest this year, 223 out of 234 households in the village participated in labor mutual assistance, laying a preliminary foundation for the development and improvement of mutual aid groups in the future.
  Three Treasures
    Song Luoxue often said that there are three treasures for living a good life, and everyone can have these treasures.
    The first treasure is: opening a flour mill to raise pigs. He runs a flour mill and can raise six or seven big fat pigs every year, accumulate dozens of carts of manure, and also eat meat and sell money. Last year, he accumulated 60 carts of fertilizer, averaging three and a half carts of fertilizer per mu.
    The second treasure is: thrift. He gets up early and goes to bed late, does a good job in village work, and also does a good job in his own production. He achieved diligent cultivation, diligent weeding, and diligent watering. Last spring, he cultivated the land twice and harrowed it three times for general crops; he watered the wheat fields five times, hoeed the cotton four times, and watered each sweet potato once and hoeed it twice. This year, all the land has been cultivated twice and harrowed four times, and it is planned to hoe the cotton six times and the sweet potatoes nine times.
    The third treasure is: improving agricultural technology. In addition to selecting and soaking seeds, he also intercrops other crops in the fields of major crops. Like last year, he interplanted crooked-neck yellow sorghum in three mu of millet land, and harvested more than two dan.

### 用生产领导生产——记劳模代表宋洛学

　　用生产领导生产
    ——记劳模代表宋洛学
    宋洛学是河北省满城县宋贾村人，共产党员，今年四十三岁。青年时给人扛过活，做过短工，后来自己开暖房，种地。一九四一年到一九四六年，任村农会主任和合作社主任。一九四九年任实业委员，一九五○年一月，被选为县各界代表会议代表及县人民政府委员。此外，自一九四二年起，一直任宋贾村党的支部委员。这次当选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议代表。
  用生产领导生产
    宋洛学不但是勤劳增产的能手，也是组织群众走向富裕的模范干部。
    一九四九年七月，他被选为全县的模范共产党员，和头等劳动模范。十一月又被选为出席县党代表会议的代表。在会议上他说：“有人说，当干部耽误生产，我觉着那是生产和工作没有配合好。我每逢工作布置下来，一会儿都不拖拉，白天下地做活，黑夜开会工作，很快就完成了。我当干部当富了，主要是我觉着生产是压倒一切的顶要紧的工作；我觉着自个儿不闹好生产，就没法领导生产。”
    宋贾村过去没有种花生的习惯，一九四九年春天，政府号召种花生。群众都说：“咱村是黑黄土，不能种。”宋洛学心里有底，不声不响从区里贷来百十斤花生种，先种上了三亩。然后和群众说：“你们都记得吗！事变第二年，我从铁路南高荆村背来了花生种，种上三分，收了一百五十斤，比一亩谷的收成还大。”群众被这事实说服了，全村共种了四十七亩。到秋天，收成果然好，每亩合五百多斤，能换六百斤米。他本人三百四十斤公粮用半亩花生就交清了。
  积极领导改进技术
    他学会了“两开一凉”温汤浸种法。这种浸种方法试验几年，总是早出苗壮，不生杂病。去年春播时，他帮助群众浸了一百八十多亩的种籽。八月里，没浸种的谷子长了黑疸，浸种的谷穗沉颠颠的。在这事实的影响下，秋天全村一千亩小麦，有百分之八十浸了种。
    宋贾村的群众在洛学的帮助下，开始对改进技术和引种优良品种有了兴趣。今年谷雨前全村六千余斤棉籽进行了粒选。棉花播种后，下了一场大雨，棉田地皮僵硬，虽经群众抢扒仍有一百二十多亩未出齐苗。为了保证良种纯不补一粒杂种，宋洛学由农场取来一百三十斤斯字二Ｂ棉籽，全部补好缺苗。开展锄草工作时，他先在群众大会上作了动员。他又和全体干部带头锄地。在他们的影响下，七八天全村八百八十多亩棉田普遍锄了一遍。后来棉花地里发现了棉蚜，他就亲到农场取鱼藤粉和喷雾器，到满城市买配药的肥皂，他首先把自己的四亩除治了。不到四五天，群众学他的样，除治一百四十亩。
    为了推广洋山芋（甘薯），宋洛学和几个村干部弄了一条大炕，从农场订购了种薯，育出四十多棵秧子，低价卖给农民，推广了二百多亩。同时在洛学的影响下，全村有三十多户分别种了六亩（农村四号，胜利百号，护国，细蔓，紫蔓，胡芦果）不同的洋薯，作栽培试验比较。
    因他对技术有钻研的精神，被选为棉花良种区六个村的技术总组长。在每个生产环节里，他都主动的召开联村技术小组会议，研究和解决技术推广的问题。
  组织起来
    宋贾村的互助组，今年才开始组织。在村支部的领导下，四个支部委员做骨干，每人组织一个互助组。宋洛学首先组织了四户，共有土地七十六亩，男劳动力六个，女劳动力四个，驴两个。在拉土运坯、耕地、拔麦、拉麦等工作中省了二十个工。这样不但克服了劳畜力不足的困难，还能挤出时间搞副业，开木厂赚米二石九斗，贩小猪赚米一石多。这个事实，使群众认清了组织起来走向富裕的方向。在今年麦收期间，全村二百三十四户中有二百二十三户参加劳动互助，给今后互助组的发展和提高初步打下基础。
  三宗宝
    宋洛学常说，过好光景有三宗宝贝，这宝贝也是人人都能有的。
    第一件宝贝是：开粉坊养猪。他开粉坊，每年能养六七个大肥猪，攒好几十车粪，还能吃肉，卖钱。他去年积肥六十大车，每亩平均施粪三车半。
    第二件宝贝是：勤俭。他早起晚睡，搞好村的工作，又搞好自己生产。他做到了勤耕，勤锄，勤浇。去年春地，一般庄稼他耕二遍，耙三遍；麦田浇五遍，棉花锄四遍，山芋每浇一遍锄两遍。今年全部土地作到耕二耙四，并计划棉花锄六遍，山芋锄九遍。
    第三件宝贝是：改良农业技术。除了选种浸种，他还在主要作物的地里间作别的作物。像去年，他在三亩谷地里间种歪脖黄高粱，打了两石多。
