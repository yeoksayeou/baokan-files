　　Production Leadership in Anyang Prefecture
    Special Correspondent Zhou Ziqin

　　Before the transformation of production work in Anyang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, the masses generally held agricultural socialist ideas, fearing to talk about getting rich and not daring to boldly develop production. Some masses would even ask the cadres if they could buy four sheep, fearing that they would stand out and be struggled against in the future. On the other hand, cadres held the erroneous idea of implementing socialism prematurely. Although they explained the policy of developing production to the masses, they always felt in their hearts that getting rich was illegal. Another common thought among cadres was that "production does not need leadership." Therefore, the entire prefecture's production work was in an abnormal state. Around March of this year, each county convened people's representative conferences to implement various policies related to production, and the situation gradually improved, pointing out a new direction for cadres in production leadership.

    I. Holding People's Representative Conferences Well is the Basic Key to Implementing the Policy of Developing Production

    The people's representative conferences convened by various counties in Anyang Prefecture around March this year mainly focused on implementing various policies for developing production. Experience has proven that: wherever the people's representative conference was seriously valued, democracy was promoted, the policies were discussed by the people's representatives, and production plans were formulated and implemented among the masses, then the production policy was well implemented; conversely, if the people's representative conference was seen as a formality, a bureaucratic attitude was adopted, democracy was not dared to be promoted, or the people's representative conference was treated as an auxiliary organ of the branch and village government, then the production policy could not be implemented and a mass production movement could not be launched.

    Therefore, there are generally two situations for people's representative conferences: one is to follow the mass line, promote the spirit of democracy and unity, and implement production policies from the perspective of the masses' interests. The methods adopted are diverse: First, "typical examples speak." Select some farmers who have become wealthy through production as typical examples and have them give reports at the conference, educating the masses with their own stories. The government also rewarded these farmers on the spot, greatly boosting the morale of the masses. After returning, the representatives publicized these facts of becoming wealthy through production to the masses, which was actually also promoting the production policy. After returning to the village, the representatives from Tangyin County exhibited the award banner and new agricultural tools awarded by the government at mass meetings, which had a great effect. When Linxian County's Seventh District held a representative conference, they selected Nanjingse Village, the district's best-performing production village, as a typical example, and the meeting place was set up in that village. After the representatives arrived, they first visited the village, looking at the crops, livestock, and cooperatives, etc. During the visit, a person was assigned to explain how to organize mutual aid, engage in sideline occupations, and how to care for livestock, etc., which inspired the representatives' enthusiasm for production and broke down their ideological concerns about not daring to develop production.

    Some selected labor models, model villages, and model groups at district party representative meetings and people's representative conferences. The selection often used the method of "three comparisons and three evaluations": the three comparisons were: comparing crops, comparing technology, and comparing mutual aid; the three evaluations were: evaluating production, evaluating policies, and evaluating work style. Typical villages also gave reports for everyone to evaluate. They evaluated the advantages and also evaluated the shortcomings. After evaluating a standard, each village then evaluated its own work based on this standard. Then the government gave rewards to those who were particularly good.

    At the Anyang Ninth District representative conference, production was promoted by using the method of comparing crops in the fields. When representatives discussed each specific issue, they related it to specific experiences and methods, making the content of the meeting richer. When the representatives discussed how to kill insects, the representative from Niuzhuang introduced his experience of using red alum to kill insects, proving that red alum was very effective. In order to study the problems existing in sowing work, everyone felt that they had to go to the fields to compare crops. The county and district cadres and representatives then went to the fields in groups to study the crops, compare each other, and specifically calculate the yields. For example, when studying the effect of red alum, two taels of red alum were used per mu of land, two sheng of wheat were sown, and there were 705 stalks per square step, with the stems being three feet and one inch high, among which there were seven stalks with loose smut; conversely, with land and seeds of equal quality and sown at the same time, there were 262 fewer stalks per square step, the stems were half a foot shorter, and there were 26 more stalks with loose smut. After using warm water to soak the cotton seeds, 6.5 jin of cotton seeds were sown per mu, yielding 196 seedlings per square step, and the seedlings were strong. Conversely, with soil and seeds of equal quality and sown at the same time, there were 26 fewer seedlings per square step, and they were generally weak, with the better ones yielding 138 seedlings. There was also a big difference between selecting seeds and not selecting seeds. Under this comparison, the representatives' thinking was clear. Everyone said that they must publicize it well to the masses after returning. The district cadres also saw the great role of the representative conference, learned some methods of leading production, and their morale was greatly improved.

    Another way to hold people's representative conferences is to act on orders and not pay attention to the conference. The conference is completely formalistic and cannot truly promote democracy. The usual routine is "the district head reports, the district committee suggests, and the representative conference passes." The village people's representative conference is "the branch decides, and the representative conference passes." Wherever these biases exist, the people's representative conference is nominal and does not play a role. Policies cannot be implemented, and production cannot be developed.

    II. There Must Be Specific Measures to Solve the Difficulties of the Masses in Production to Ensure the Implementation of Resolutions.

    At the people's representative conferences held in various places, various organizational steps were generally adopted to ensure the implementation and realization of decisions: 1. Signing contracts. Solving farmers' difficulties with agricultural tools and seeds, and organizing material exchanges between villages. Before signing contracts, various exhibitions were used to exhibit what the farmers needed. The farmers signed contracts on the spot according to their needs. The cooperative then lent the farmers what they needed on preferential terms. The farmers' surplus products were also brought by the representatives when they came to the meeting, and exhibited at the conference first, and the villages exchanged them with each other according to their needs. If there was still a surplus, the cooperative organized exchanges with cities. The agricultural tools and daily necessities needed by each village were also statistically collected before the representatives came, how much was needed, and the cooperative used the contract method to uniformly adjust them. This not only facilitated material exchanges, but also met the needs of farmers and eliminated intermediate exploitation. When signing contracts, the principle of mutual benefit was generally followed, specifications were strictly determined, the conditions and exchange time were stipulated, and both parties were guaranteed to strictly abide by their credit. 2. Conducting various experiments. At the representative conference, various production experts brought their tools, seeds, etc. and conducted experiments on the spot. For example, cotton planting experts experimented with cotton planting methods and took the representatives to the cotton fields to talk about cotton management experience; experts in curing oily droughts taught the representatives how to cure oily droughts; Cheng Baifu of Linxian County was good at soaking seeds in warm water, so he taught everyone how to soak seeds and experimented for the representatives to see on the spot. Now meetings are held like this, with tasks, policies, and methods. The masses are happy, and the cadres have high confidence. 3. Implementing policies to ensure that land rights, property rights, and human rights are not violated. At the representative conference, specific examples of violations of policies and infringements on land rights and property rights were found and dealt with. In this way, the masses truly saw that the government was protecting private property, so they were at ease in production. When each representative publicized it to the villages, it was widespread and rapid, the masses believed it, and the effect was great. Phenomena of violating policies were also reduced.

    After the meeting, the county discipline inspection committees and the county judicial departments jointly organized inspection teams to go to the countryside to receive complaints from the masses. All cases involving infringement of private property rights were immediately investigated and dealt with as soon as the masses raised them.

    III. Once the Production Movement is Launched, Technical Leadership Must Be Strengthened to Deepen Production Work.

    Generally, cadres did not know how to engage in production at first, so the leadership adopted the method of giving technical lessons to cadres. Based on each seasonal activity, they first taught the cadres how to learn, and then taught the farmers in the villages. For example, the cadres in Tangyin, Anyang, and Linxian counties generally learned the technology. The cadres in Tangyin generally learned how to manage cotton, soak seeds in warm water, kill insects with red alum, and cure oily droughts. Some cadres also learned how to treat livestock for ringworm. Many primary school teachers also learned how to give vaccinations and plant cowpox. Cadres and the masses were very enthusiastic about technical learning. As soon as it was said that technology would be taught, they all went. For example, in order to promote seed selection, the technical committee of Lijia Factory Village in Linxian County researched that wheat grown in red soil had good color, produced oil, and produced more flour; wheat grown in white soil was not good, and wheat grown in red soil would not change color in white soil in one or two years. Ma Xiangchang's wheat grew very well after seed selection and variety replacement. The masses were mobilized to visit and promote the selection of more red soil wheat seeds by the masses. When promoting seed soaking, they learned from the discussion of technology that soaking seeds was good: not only did it remove chaffy seeds, but it also emerged neatly and quickly, and it could also kill bacteria, so that crops would have fewer diseases and pests. Tangyin cadres also created the experience of mobilizing the masses to use technology. After the district cadres arrived in Bailong Village, they learned that the cotton and peanuts planted in the village for the first time had not yet emerged from the soil. After the rain, the masses were eager to sow, but most of them were not prepared to soak the seeds. They took the Sizizi cotton, Dezizi cotton, and mixed cotton and sprayers out for exhibition on the street and demonstrated the seed soaking method in public. A large number of people visited. At the same time, the policy of comparing the prices of cotton and grain was publicized, and 1,500 jin of cotton seeds were lent. The farmers in each street immediately discussed how to soak seeds and how to expand cotton fields. After sowing, the masses also asked for solutions for planting sweet potatoes, millet, and jade. They also helped them establish technical groups, and the technical groups studied how to manage cotton, apply topdressing fertilizer, and prevent pests, which the masses were very satisfied with. Because the cadres learned production technology, they also felt that they had a way to lead production.

    IV. The Leadership, Assistance, and Close Cooperation of the State-Owned Economy is a Reliable Guarantee for Success.

    The combination of various state-owned professional companies, banks, cooperatives, and mutual aid groups to assist and support production has a great effect on developing production. The main methods of assistance are through signing contracts. There are mainly the following three types of contracts: 1. Pre-purchase contract for cotton. Flowers are harvested in autumn, and grain is given now, eight jin of millet per jin of flowers. The prefecture has already pre-ordered 10 million jin of cotton. Last year, because it was not guaranteed that each jin of flowers would be worth eight jin of rice, the farmers were dissatisfied. This year, they are at ease and have expanded the cotton field area. Last year, 340,000 mu of cotton were planted, and this year 860,000 mu were planted. The contract stipulates the specifications of cotton, rewards planting Sizizi cotton, and improves the quality of cotton. 2. Pre-order coal contract. The cooperative pre-orders coal from the mine to supply to farmers for burning, at 5% to 10% lower than the market price. After the wheat harvest, it is repaid with wheat. 3. Pre-order mountain goods and local products such as flax seeds and eggs contract. On the one hand, it promotes the exchange of goods between rural areas and exports surplus agricultural products to big cities; at the same time, it exchanges industrial products from big cities, and organizes farmers through this economic activity. This year, the cooperative has developed to 350,000 members, and it can be developed to 500,000 by the end of the year.

    In terms of specific assistance methods, the economic committees at all levels mainly study specific methods, formulate plans based on various seasonal productions, and then realize them through the organization of mutual aid groups.

    The following methods are emphasized to strengthen the organization of mutual aid groups: 1. Organize small-scale mutual aid according to various production activities. For example, well digging organizes well digging mutual aid; 1,000 water carts are lent, so 1,000 mutual aid groups are organized; coal transportation organizes transportation mutual aid groups; production organizes production mutual aid. 2. Implement the combination of mutual aid groups and cooperatives. The cooperative can use labor, which can solve the surplus labor problem of sideline production in mutual aid groups; the cooperative consolidates the mutual aid groups by lending agricultural tools through mutual aid groups. 3. Formulate plans according to each season for mutual aid, such as sowing after rain and building houses. With a plan, there will be no disputes. 4. Mutual aid groups implement the voluntary and mutually beneficial policy. Starting from reality, they often organize various sideline activities, which can gradually develop from short-term temporary mutual aid to long-term mutual aid activities. And gradually improve according to the farmers' own requirements. The experience of Anyang Prefecture proves that to develop production, it is difficult to develop production by relying solely on the masses organizing themselves without the support of the state-owned economy.

  V. The Correct Path to Leading Production

    From the experience of leading production in Anyang Prefecture, it can be seen that: after the Second Party Congress of Pingyuan Province, the prefecture has found a path. The path has been proven to be correct by the facts. Because it has firmly grasped the implementation of production policies through the people's congress, united the broad masses of the people in rural areas, and worked hard to realize the policy of developing production and getting rich through labor. Therefore, it has created a mass production upsurge.

    The reason why this path is correct is also because it starts from the masses, is honest and honest, and every specific work is closely combined with the interests of the broad masses, so it has grasped the greatest demands of the majority of the people - stability, unity, and production. Therefore, it has been enthusiastically welcomed by the broad masses.

    The reason why this path is correct is not only reflected in the elimination of the masses' concerns about becoming wealthy through production, the improvement of production enthusiasm, and the relief of cadres' depression in work, and the finding of ways to lead production; but the most important thing is that it clearly points out the importance of technical guidance, explains the relationship between the state-owned economy, cooperatives, and mutual aid groups, and explains that these organizations should all work together under the direction of organizing and developing production. Therefore, the experience created by Anyang Prefecture, although still preliminary and needs to be enriched by future efforts, is valuable.

　　安阳专区的生产领导
    本报特派记者  周子芹
    平原省安阳专区在生产工作没有转变以前，群众中普遍存在农业社会主义的思想，怕说富，不敢大胆发展生产。有的群众买四只羊，也要问问干部能不能买，惟恐自己突出，将来被斗争。而干部中则存在提早实行社会主义的错误思想，虽也向群众讲解发展生产的政策，但心里总觉得富是不合法的。干部中另一个普遍的思想，是认为“生产不用领导”。因此，全区的生产工作是处在不正常的状况中。今年三月前后，各县普遍召开了各界人民代表会，贯彻了各项有关生产的政策，情况才逐步好转，在生产领导上给干部指出了一个新的方向。
    一、开好人民代表会是贯彻发展生产政策的基本关键
    安阳专区各县在今年三月先后召开的各界人民代表会，主要以贯彻发展生产的各项政策为主要内容。经验证明：凡是认真的重视了人民代表会，发扬了民主，经人民代表会讨论了政策，制定了生产计划，并贯彻到群众中去，则生产政策就贯彻得好；反之，把人民代表会看成形式，采取官僚主义的态度，不敢发扬民主，或把人民代表会当成支部和村政府的附属机关，则生产政策就贯彻不下去，群众性的生产运动就搞不起来。
    因此，人民代表会一般有两种情况：一种是走群众路线，发扬民主团结的精神，从群众利益出发贯彻生产政策。采用的办法是多种多样的：首先要“典型说话”。选择一些生产发家的农民作典型，在大会上作报告，用群众自己的事情教育群众。政府又当场奖励了这些农民，群众情绪极高。代表们回去后，就将这些生产发家的事实向群众宣传，实际上也就是宣传了生产政策。汤阴县代表回村后，把政府奖给的奖旗、新式农具等在群众大会上展览，收郊很大。林县七区开代表会时，选择全区生产最好的南景色村为典型，会场就设在那个村里，代表到后先进行参观，看庄稼，看牲口，看合作社等，参观时并有专人解释如何组织起来搞互助，搞副业，如何调养牲口等，鼓舞了代表们的生产热情。打破了代表们不敢发展生产的思想顾虑。
    有的在区党代表会议和人代会上，评选劳动模范、模范村、模范组。评选多用三比三评办法：三比是：比庄稼、比技术、比互助；三评是评生产、评政策、评作风。也是由典型村报告，大家评。评优点，也评缺点。评出一个标准后，各村再根据这个标准，评自己村的工作。然后政府对特别好的给予奖励。
    安阳九区代表会上，则用田间比庄稼的办法，推动了生产。会上讨论到每个具体问题时，就联系到结合具体经验和办法，使会议内容更加丰富。当代表们讨论到如何杀虫时，牛庄代表就介绍他用红矾杀虫的经验，证明红矾杀虫效力大。代表们为了研究下种工作上存在的问题，大家认为必须到田间比庄稼，县区干部即与各代表分片到地里研究庄稼，互相比较，具体计算产量。如在研究到红矾的效果时，每亩地用红矾二两，种麦二升，每方步长七百零五棵，茎高三尺一寸，其中有乌霉病者七棵；反之，有同等质量土地，种子，同时播种，每方步少出二百六十二棵，茎短半尺，乌霉病多二十六棵。棉花用温汤浸种后，每亩六斤半花籽，每方步出苗一百九十六棵，苗壮，好的出到一百七十二棵。反之用同等土质，种子，同时播种，每方步少出二十六棵，一般瘦弱，较好的出一百三十八棵。选种和未选种的也有很大差别。在这样对比下，代表们的思想都通了。大家表示回去后一定要好好向群众宣传。区干部也看到了代表会的作用大，又学到了些领导生产的办法，情绪也大大提高。
    另一种开人代会的办法，是奉命办事，对会议不重视。开会完全是形式主义的，不能真正发扬民主，照例是“区长报告，区委建议，代表会通过”。村的人代会则是支部决定，代表会通过”。凡是存在这些偏向的，人民代表会就是有名无实，不起作用。政策就贯彻不下去，生产也搞不起来。
    二、必须有具体办法解决群众生产中的困难，才能保证决议的贯彻。
    在各地召开的人民代表会上，大都采用了各种组织步骤，以保证决定的贯彻和实现：一、订合同。解决农民农具、种子等困难，组织村与村间的物资交流。订合同以前，通过各种展览会，把农民所需要的东西在展览会上进行展览。农民根据自己的需要，当场订立合同。合作社就将农民所需要的东西，按优待条件贷给农民。对农民的剩余生产品，也是在代表来开会时随身带来，先在大会上展览，各村根据自己需要，互相交换。再有剩余的，则由合作社组织向城市交流。各村所需要的农具以及生活必需品，也有在代表来时，先进行统计，共需用多少，由合作社用订合同办法，统一调剂。这样，既便利了物资交流，又满足了农民的需要，免除了中间剥削。订立合同时，一般都根据两利原则，严格确定规格，规定的条件与交换时间，双方保证严守信用。二、作各种试验。在代表会上，有各种生产能手，来时把他的工具、种子等都带来，在大会上进行当场试验。如植棉能手试验植棉办法，当场把代表领到棉花地里讲管理棉花经验；治油旱的能手则教给各代表治油旱的方法；林县成百福的温汤浸种好，就教给大家如何浸种，并当场试验给代表们看。现在这样开会，有任务，有政策，有办法，群众高兴，干部信心也高了。三、贯彻确保地权、财权、人权不受侵犯的政策。在代表会上，找了些违犯政策，侵犯地权、财权的具体实例，予以处理。这样，群众就真正看到了政府保障私有财产，就放心生产了。各代表到村一宣传，又广泛，又迅速，群众相信，效果很大。违犯政策的现象也就减少了。
    会后，各县纪律检查委员会和县司法科协同组织检查组，下乡去接收群众的控告，凡有关侵犯私有财产权的案件，一经群众提出，立即予以调查处理。
    三、生产运动一经展开，必须加强技术领导，才能使生产工作深入开展。
    一般干部起初都不会搞生产，领导上就采取给干部上技术课的办法，根据每个季节活动，先教干部学会，然后到村里教给农民。如汤阴、安阳、林县等县干部，普遍都学会了技术。汤阴干部普遍的都学会了管理棉花，温汤浸种，红矾杀虫，治油旱等办法。还有一部分干部学会了给牲口治癣病。很多小学教员还学会了打防疫针，种牛痘。干部和群众对技术学习都很热心。一说讲技术就都去了。如林县李家厂村为推广选种，技术委员会研究出红土地长的麦子色好，出油性，多出面；白土地长的麦子不好，红土地长的麦子种到白土地里，一二年不变色。马象昌经过选种换种，麦子长的很好。发动群众去参观，推动群众多选红土地麦种。在推动浸种时，从讨论技术中，知道浸种的好处：不光浮去秕籽，出的齐，出的快，且能杀菌，使庄稼少生病虫害。汤阴干部也创造了发动群众运用技术的经验。区干部到白龙村后，了解了该村第一次种的棉花、花生尚未出土，雨后群众急于下种，但大部都未准备浸种。他们就在大街上把斯字棉、德字棉、杂棉等三种种籽，和喷雾器拿出展览，并当众试验浸种办法，参观的群众极多。同时又进行了棉粮比价政策的宣传，又贷下棉种一千五百斤。各街农民即纷纷议论如何浸种，如何扩大棉田等。下种后，群众又要求解决种红薯、谷子、玉茭等办法。又帮助他们成立了技术小组，并由技术小组研究了如何管理棉花，施追肥，防止虫害等办法，群众极满意。因为干部学会了生产技术，也感到对领导生产有办法了。
    四、国营经济的领导扶助、紧密配合，是获得成功的可靠保证。
    各国营专业公司、银行与合作社、互助组的结合，扶助与支持生产，对发展生产的作用是很大的。扶助的办法，主要是通过订合同，合同主要的有下面三种：一、预购棉花合同，秋天收花，现在给粮食，每斤花八斤小米。该专区已预订棉花一千万斤。去年因没保证到每斤花八斤米，农民不满，今年放心了，扩大了棉田面积。去年种花三十四万亩，今年种到八十六万亩。订合同时规定棉花规格，奖励了种斯字棉，提高了棉花质量。二、预定煤炭合同。由合作社向矿厂预订煤，供给农民烧用，按市价低百分之五到百分之十。麦收后以麦子归还。三、预订麻子、鸡蛋等山货土产合同。一方面推动农村之间调剂有无，把多余农产品输出到大城市中去；同时从大城市换回工业品，通过这种经济活动把农民组织起来。今年合作社已发展到三十五万社员，年底可发展到五十万。
    在扶持的具体办法上，主要是由各级经济委员会研究出具体办法，根据各种季节生产，定出计划，然后通过组织互助组来实现。
    对互助组则强调以下各种方式以加强其组织：一、根据各项生产活动，组织小型互助。如打井即组织打井互助；贷水车一千辆，就组织一千个互助组；运煤组织运输互助组；生产组织生产互助。二、实行互助组与合作社结合。合作社使用劳力，就可以解决了互助组副业生产的剩余劳力问题；合作社通过互助组贷放农具，也巩固了互助组。三、根据每个季节订出计划，进行互助，如雨后下种，盖房子，有了计划，就不会发生争执。四、互助组贯彻自愿两利政策，从实际出发，经常组织各种副业活动，可以逐渐由短期的临时性的互助。发展成为长期的互助活动。并根据农民自己的要求，逐渐提高。安阳专区的经验证明，要发展生产，没有国营经济的扶持，光靠群众自己组织起来，发展生产是困难的。
  五、领导生产的正确道路
    从安阳专区领导生产的经验可以看出：该专区在平原省第二次党代表会议之后，已经找出了一条道路。这条道路，事实的证明是正确的。因为紧紧的掌握住了通过人代会贯彻生产政策，团结了农村的广大人民，为实现发展生产劳动致富的政策而努力。因此，造成了群众性的生产热潮。
    这条道路之所以正确，还由于他是从群众出发的，老老实实的，每个具体工作都和广大群众的利益紧紧结合，因而他就掌握住了最大多数人民的最大要求——安定、团结、生产。因而得到广大群众的热情欢迎。
    这条道路之所以正确，不仅表现在农民生产发家顾虑的解除，生产热情的提高，解除了干部工作上的苦闷，找到了领导生产的门路；而且最重要的是清楚的指出了技术指导的重要，说明了国营经济、合作社、互助组之间的相互关系，并说明这些组织都应当在组织起来，发展生产的方针下共同努力。因此，安阳专区所创造的经验，虽然还是初步的，还有待今后努力加以充实，但是值得珍贵的。
