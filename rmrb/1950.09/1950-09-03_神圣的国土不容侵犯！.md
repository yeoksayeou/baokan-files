　　The Sacred Territory is Inviolable!
　　Combat Hero Wei Laiguo
　　The U.S. imperialist planes used to bomb and strafe the Korean people have recently invaded our Northeast airspace on many occasions, strafed our sacred border, and massacred our compatriots, launching a presumptuous provocation against the Chinese people. We are extremely angry, and we fully agree with and support the just protest already lodged by Foreign Minister Zhou on behalf of the Chinese people.
　　We have not forgotten the disasters caused by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in China over the past few years, but after the arduous struggle of the Chinese people, we have achieved a glorious victory. Standing on the forefront of the international arena, we are constantly vigilant and determined to defend the victory of the Chinese people and defend the border of the motherland. If U.S. imperialism dares to provoke and invade us, we will surely crush it and make it eat its own bitter fruit!
　　We will also resolutely implement Premier Zhou's statement on behalf of the Chinese people, strive to prepare everything, and liberate Taiwan, the Chinese territory, from the hands of the United States. No matter how the U.S. "Seventh Fleet" or "Eighth Fleet" obstructs us, we have the confidence, determination, strength, and means to liberate Taiwan!
　　American warmongers! We warn you! The Chinese people have stood up and are not to be bullied! Chinese territory is inviolable! All commanders and fighters of our People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people stand closely together and will fight to the end to better defend our sacred border and liberate Taiwan!

　　神圣的国土不容侵犯！
    战斗英雄  魏来国
    美帝国主义用来轰炸扫射朝鲜人民的飞机，最近多次的侵袭我东北领空，并向我神圣的边疆扫射，残杀我同胞，向中国人民进行狂妄的挑衅，我们是非常愤怒的，我们完全同意和支援周外长已经替中国人民所提出的正义的抗议。
    我们并未忘记数年来由于美帝国主义和它的走狗在中国所造成的灾难，但经过中国人民的艰苦的搏斗已取得光荣的胜利。我们站在国际的最前线，随时提高警惕，一定要保卫中国人民的胜利，保卫祖国的边疆。美帝国主义胆敢向我们挑衅和侵犯，我们一定把它粉碎，一定叫它自食其果！
    我们并坚决执行周总理代表中国人民的声明，努力准备一切，要从美国手中解放中国领土台湾，不管美国的“第七舰队”或者“第八舰队”如何阻挠，我们是有信心有决心有力量有办法解放台湾的！
    美国战争贩子们！我们警告你们！中国人民已经站起来了，是不可欺侮的！中国领土是不容侵犯的！我们人民解放军全体指战员和中国人民紧紧站在一道，将为更好的保卫我国神圣的边疆和解放台湾而奋斗到底！
