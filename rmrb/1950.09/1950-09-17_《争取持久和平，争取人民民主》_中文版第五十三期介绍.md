Xinhua News Agency, 15th - Introducing Issue No. 53 (Total No. 93) of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy" (Chinese Edition), which has already been published.

　　This issue publishes the communique reported by the Soviet Peace Defense Committee regarding the completion of the signature collection campaign for the Stockholm Peace Appeal by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress in the Soviet Union. At the same time, it publishes an editorial titled "The Soviet Union—The True Bastion of Peace and Security for All Peoples." The editorial points out: All peace supporters unanimously express satisfaction and gratification with this communique. In the Soviet Union, from June 30th to August 1st, in just one month, all of the adult population, 115,275,940 citizens, participated in the signature campaign. The editorial points out: The action of the great Soviet people in unanimously supporting the Stockholm Peace Appeal once again demonstrates the Soviet people's deep love for peace, their support for peace, and their pioneering role in the struggle for human happiness. The peace signature campaign in the Soviet Union is a truly national movement. This movement proves the solidarity between the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the Communist Party, and their determination to protect humanity and oppose war. This movement also proves the Soviet people's pioneering role in the struggle against war and for consolidating peace. The active participation of the Soviet people in the movement to defend peace has encouraged peace fighters around the world and has sparked a new wave of peace advocacy in all countries. The editorial points out: The American military's aggression against Korea and the ugly attempt by the American ruling class to disguise its armed aggression against Korea in the name of the United Nations stand in stark contrast to the Soviet Union's proposal for "peaceful resolution of the Korean issue," making it clear to the people of all countries where war is and where peace is; what is a policy of aggression and what is a policy of peace. The editorial points out that American imperialism is extending its aggression throughout Asia, putting humanity directly in the face of the threat of American imperialism directly attempting to launch a new world war. The editorial says: But what the people of all countries around the world demand is peace, not war. They not only demand peace, but they are actively striving for peace. The unprecedented expansion of the peace movement is a serious warning to the imperialist camp. It is not the Soviet Union and the peace and democracy camp it leads that fear war, but the imperialists and aggressors. The organized will of the people of all countries will surely thwart the evil and bloody plans of the new war instigators.

　　This issue publishes an important essay by William Z. Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, titled "The People's Front and People's Democracy."

　　In addition, this issue also publishes essays such as "The Achievements of the People's Republic of Albania" by Enver Hoxha, General Secretary of the Albanian Workers' Party, and "The Austrian People's Struggle for Peace and Independence" by Johann Koplenig, Chairman of the Communist Party of Austria.

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主》
    中文版第五十三期介绍
    【新华社十五日讯】《争取持久和平，争取人民民主》中文版第五十三期（总第九十三期）已经出版。
    该刊本期在刊载苏联保卫和平委员会所报道的关于苏联国内完成世界和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的征集签名运动的公报。同时，发表以“苏联——各国人民和平与安全的真正堡垒”为题的社论。社论指出：一切和平的拥护者对这个公报都一致表示满意和欣慰。苏联从六月三十日到八月一日仅仅一个月的时间，苏联全国就有全部成年人口、一亿一千五百二十七万五千九百四十个公民参加了签名。社论指出：伟大苏联人民一致拥护斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的行动，又一次表明了苏联人民深爱和平，拥护和平，和在争取人类幸福的斗争中的先锋作用。和平签名运动在苏联是一个真正具有全国范围性质的运动。这个运动证明了苏联人民、苏联政府和共产党间的团结一致，决心保护人类、反对战争。这个运动也证明了苏联人民在反对战争、巩固和平斗争中的先锋作用。由于苏联人民积极参加保卫和平的运动，鼓舞了世界和平斗士，使一切国家中的拥护和平活动又涌起了新的浪潮。社论指出：美国军队侵略朝鲜和美国统治阶级企图以联合国名义去掩饰武装侵略朝鲜的丑态，恰和苏联“和平解决朝鲜问题”的建议形成明显的对照，使各国人民看清了那儿是战争，那儿是和平；什么是侵略政策，什么是和平政策。社论指出，美帝国主义正在亚洲各地伸展其侵略，使人类直接面临着美帝国主义直接企图发动新的世界战争的威胁，社论说：但是全世界各国人民所要求的是和平而不是战争，他们不仅要求和平，而且正在积极争取和平。和平运动空前的扩大，对于帝国主义阵营是一种严重的警告。害怕战争的不是苏联和它所领导的和平民主阵营，而是帝国主义者和侵略者。各国人民有组织的意志必能挫败新战争挑拨者的罪恶的流血计划。
    本期刊载了美国共产党主席福斯特的重要论文《人民阵线与人民民主》。
    另外，本期还刊载了阿尔巴尼亚工人党总书记霍查写的《阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的成就》、奥国共产党主席柯浦来尼希写的《奥国人民争取和平与独立的斗争》等论文。
