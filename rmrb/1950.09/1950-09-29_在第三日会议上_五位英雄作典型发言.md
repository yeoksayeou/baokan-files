Xinhua News Agency, 27th: At the third morning session of the National Combat Heroes Representatives Meeting, five combat hero representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force—Tai Xide, Jiang Xinliang, Wang Hongzhi, Zhao Xiaoan, and Liu Zilin—made typical speeches. The five heroes unanimously expressed their determination to follow the instructions of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, continue to work hard and make greater progress, carry forward revolutionary heroism, and strive to build a strong national defense force. The reports by Air Force hero pilot Wang Hongzhi and Navy hero gunner Zhao Xiaoan vividly reflected the significant achievements and heroic deeds already demonstrated by these two young, modernized branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. All attendees warmly applauded the rapid growth of the motherland's Air Force and Navy with great joy.

	Army combat hero Liu Zilin is a young commander who created the glorious record of wiping out three enemy divisions in three battles. At the meeting, he reported on the course of these three pursuit battles. In the battle of Xinglongkeng Ridge in Dexing County, Jiangxi, Liu Zilin, then a company commander, led only one assault team straight into the heart of the enemy's position, disrupting the enemy's deployment. Then, with the cooperation of two companies from fraternal units, he completely annihilated the Chiang bandit 143rd Division. In the battle in the Nafu area of Zhaoshan County, Guangdong, Liu Zilin, already a deputy battalion commander, led another squad into the enemy division headquarters, forcing more than 2,700 men of the enemy's 4th Security Division to surrender. This hero, only twenty-five years old, not only cultivated courage and resourcefulness in the 250 large and small battles he personally experienced in the past twelve years but also brilliantly demonstrated his command ability. This lies in resolutely and decisively adopting the sharp-knife tactics of attacking the enemy's heart and command center based on accurately grasping the enemy's situation.

	Combat hero Jiang Xinliang, now a deputy company commander of a certain unit of the Northeast Military Region, served as a platoon leader during the Pingjin Campaign. He described the process by which he and his comrades captured Fengtai Railway Station, thereby cooperating with other fraternal units to complete the battle to surround the enemy troops in Beiping.

	Combat hero Tai Xide of the People's Cavalry delivered his speech in Mongolian. This deputy chief of staff of a cavalry regiment inherited the valiant and skilled combat traditions of the Mongolian knights. In the battle of Beidawo in Siping, he shouted the heroic battle slogan: "Live on horseback, die on horseback, let the saber see blood, and perform meritorious service for the people!" He took the lead, wielding his saber and charging into the enemy's阵, single-handedly砍死 over forty enemies. He is only twenty-three years old, but for the sake of national liberation and the independence of the motherland, he has fought against the enemy more than 200 times in the past five years, including more than 40 mounted charges. The battle has not stopped, and the hero expressed his steel-like determination. At the meeting, he raised his voice and clenched his fist, saying: "We must remember the instructions of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and build the Inner Mongolian cavalry into a strong national defense cavalry force. If American imperialism dares to invade the motherland, our Inner Mongolian cavalry guarantees to execute orders, immediately mobilize, cooperate with friendly forces, and completely and cleanly eliminate the invaders!"

　　在第三日会议上
    五位英雄作典型发言
    【新华社二十七日讯】全国战斗英雄代表会议第三日上午，由邰喜德、姜新良、王洪智、赵孝庵、刘子林等五位陆、海、空军战斗英雄代表作了典型发言。发言的五位英雄一致表示要遵照毛主席和朱总司令的指示继续努力更加进步，发扬革命的英雄主义，为建设强大的国防军而奋斗。空军英雄飞行员王洪智和海军英雄枪炮手赵孝庵的报告，生动地反映了中国人民解放军这两支年青的现代化部队业已表现出来的重大成就和英雄事迹。全体与会者都以极大的喜悦为祖国人民空军和海军的迅速成长而热烈鼓掌。
    陆军战斗英雄刘子林是创建三战歼敌三个师光辉战绩的青年指挥员。他在会上报告了这三次追歼战的经过。在江西德兴县兴隆坑岭的战斗中，当时是连指挥员的刘子林只带领一个突击队直扑敌阵心脏，将敌军部署打乱，然后在兄弟部队两个连的配合下，全部歼灭了蒋匪一四三师。在广东召山县那夫地区的战斗中，刘子林已是一个副营长，他又带领一个班突入敌人师部迫敌保四师二千七百多人投降。这位年仅二十五岁的英雄，在过去十二年大小二百五十次亲历的战斗中，不仅锻炼了勇敢和机智，并且已卓越地表现了他的指挥才能，这就是在精确掌握敌情的基础上，坚决果敢地采取了突击敌人心脏和首脑的尖刀战术。
    现为东北军区某部副连长的战斗英雄姜新良在平津战役时担任排长，他叙述了他和他的战友们攻占丰台车站的经过，从而配合其他兄弟部队完成了包围北平敌军的战斗任务。
    人民骑兵部队的战斗英雄邰喜德用蒙语发言，这位骑兵部队团的副参谋长继承了蒙古骑士的勇猛善战的战斗传统，在四平北大洼的战斗中，他喊出了英雄的战斗口号：“活在马上，死在马上，战刀见血，为人民立功！”他身先士卒，挥舞战刀冲入敌阵，一人砍死敌人四十多个。他年仅二十三岁，但为了民族解放和祖国的独立，在过去五年中，却已同敌人作战二百多次，其中乘马冲锋即达四十多次。战斗并没有停止，英雄表示了他钢铁般的决心，他在会上提高嗓子、捏紧拳头说：“我们一定要记住毛主席和朱总司令的指示，把内蒙的骑兵建设成强大的国防骑兵部队。如果美帝国主义敢于侵犯祖国，我们内蒙骑兵部队保证执行命令，立即出动，配合友军，把侵略者彻底干净地消灭！”
