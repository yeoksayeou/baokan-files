Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. September—On September 2nd, 1945, the Japanese government signed the Instrument of Surrender, unconditionally surrendering to the Allied Powers. However, for five years, under the active support of US imperialism, the Japanese reactionary government has intensified its efforts to revive militarist forces and is using the opportunity of the US aggression against Korea to attempt to reignite aggression, openly acting as henchmen in the US war of aggression.

Since the outbreak of the Korean War, Japan's transportation and military industries have been directly serving the US war of aggression. The loyal running dog of US imperialism, the Yoshida government and its Liberal Party, have repeatedly clamored that the war cannot be regarded as "a fire on the other side of the bank." Figures like Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsuo Okazaki and Senate President Naotake Satō have repeatedly clamored that if the United States "requests" it, Japan "should dispatch volunteer soldiers" to participate in the war. On August 4th, Shigeru Yoshida even arrogantly clamored that Japan's "assistance" to the US action in Korea should be "nationwide." That is to say, he is trying to drag the entire Japan into the aggressive adventure launched by the United States.

In order to promote the so-called "nationwide" aggression plan, the Yoshida government, under the direction of its American masters, is working hard to restore the fascist wartime system. Since the illegal closure of the Japanese Communist Party's central organ newspaper, *Akahata*, on June 26th, the Yoshida government has successively closed down thousands of progressive newspapers and periodicals, and "dismissed" hundreds of progressive journalists, attempting to stifle the voice of the Japanese people. In order to pave the way for the mobilization of the so-called "human resources" plan, the Yoshida government illegally disbanded the largest trade union organization in Japan—the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Council, and persecuted a large number of progressive workers, plotting to turn the trade unions into "industrial service associations" again. In terms of finance, the total amount of the next fiscal year's budget recently submitted by the various departments of the Yoshida government to the Ministry of Finance for general purposes alone reached more than 1,060 billion yen, an increase of more than 60 percent compared with the current fiscal year's ordinary budget of 660 billion yen. On August 29th, at the "Current Affairs Symposium" of the Liberal Party, the Democratic Party, and the Socialist Party, Liberal Party Secretary-General Eisaku Satō and Policy Research Council Chairman Ryūtarō Nemoto openly stated that the next fiscal year's budget was prepared based on the "viewpoint" of "actively assisting" the United States in the Korean War.

Although Japanese militarists are attempting to rise again with the support of American imperialists, the Japanese people today are resolutely fighting for peace, freedom, and democracy. In the face of the growing strength of the Japanese people and the strength of the people of the world, the Yoshida fascist clique will receive the punishment it deserves.

　　在美帝国主义积极扶植下
    日本军国主义者妄图重起侵略
    公然充当美国侵朝战争中的鹰犬
    【新华社二日讯】一九四五年九月二日，日本政府签署降书，向盟国无条件投降。但是，五年以来，日本反动政府在美帝国主义的积极扶植下，加紧复活军国主义势力并正利用美国侵略朝鲜的时机，妄图重起侵略，并已公然充当美国进行侵略战争中的鹰犬。
    在朝鲜战争爆发后，日本的交通运输和军事工业都已在直接为美国侵略战争服务。美帝国主义的忠实走狗吉田政府及其自由党，曾一再鼓吹不能将战争看作“隔岸之火”。内阁书记长官冈崎胜男和参院议长佐藤尚武之流，更再三地叫嚣：如果美国“请求”的话，日本“应该派遣志愿军”参战。八月四日，吉田茂更狂妄地叫嚣：日本“协助”美国在朝鲜的行动，应该是“举国一致”的。这就是说，他正力图把整个日本，拖入美国发动的侵略冒险中。
    为了推行所谓“举国一致”的侵略计划，吉田政府在其美国主子指使下，正努力恢复法西斯战时体制。自六月二十六日非法封闭日本共产党中央机关报赤旗报开始，吉田政府相继封闭了上千的进步报刊，又“解雇”了成百的进步新闻工作者，力图以此来窒息日本人民的声音。为了替动员所谓“人的资源”计划扫清道路，吉田政府非法地解散了日本最大的职工组织——全日工会联络协议会，并迫害大批进步职工，阴谋使工会再度“产业报国会化”。在财政方面，吉田政府各部门最近提交大藏省的下一会计年度的预算中，仅一般用途的数目总计就达一万零六百余亿日元，比现行会计年度的普通预算的六千六百余亿日元增加百分之六十以上。自由党干事长佐藤荣作和政务调查会会长根本龙太郎在八月二十九日举行的自由党、民主党与社会党三党的“时局座谈会”上，曾公然声称：下一会计年度的预算，是根据“积极协助”美国从事朝鲜战争的“观点”编制的。
    尽管日本军国主义者在美国帝国主义者的扶植下妄图再起，但是，今天的日本人民正在坚决地为和平、自由与民主而斗争。在日益壮大的日本人民力量与世界人民力量的面前，吉田法西斯集团必将得到应得的惩罚。
