　　The American aggressors, in order to salvage the serious defeats they have already suffered in the war of aggression against Korea, are continuing to engage in a frenzied and adventurous military gamble, following the steps that people had long anticipated. After a long period of preparation by the warmonger MacArthur, the American aggressors concentrated their superior forces of land, sea, and air on the 15th and 16th of this month, landing at Incheon Port in western Korea and invading Seoul.

　　As early as July 6th of this year, this newspaper pointed out in an editorial entitled "The Victorious Future of the Korean People's Liberation War": American imperialism is not yet willing to accept defeat in Korea. It is continuing to reinforce its troops, attempting to further expand its aggression, and has mobilized countries such as Britain, Australia, and New Zealand to send troops to assist in the war, in order to save the collapse of the counter-revolutionary front. At that time, we further pointed out that this would make the victory of the Korean people come more slowly and would force the Korean people to prepare for a sustained and more arduous battle. We cited our country's War of Resistance Against Japan and Vietnam's War of Resistance Against France as examples, proving that even after a long and arduous war, victory still belongs to the Korean people. The current development of the Korean war situation completely proves our assertion.

　　Obviously, the American aggressors' current military actions in Korea are completely a gamble. The fact that American imperialism has mobilized such a large armed force to attack Korea only further exposes American imperialism's outward strength but inward weakness, extreme fragility, and frantic actions. Although it increases the difficulties for the Korean people on the road to victory, it will never achieve the goal of conquering the Korean people. American imperialism's adventure in Korea has three basic weaknesses: first, the American aggressors and their running dogs are the mortal enemies of all the Korean people, and they are completely isolated; second, the rear is too far away; and third, morale is low. In a protracted war, it is bound to fail miserably. Therefore, although the future struggle of the Korean people will be a difficult and protracted situation, as long as the Korean people continue to unite as one, adhere to a protracted war, and make all necessary preparations for a protracted war, no matter what difficulties and twists and turns they experience, the final victory belongs to the Korean people without any doubt.

　　The result of the outwardly strong but inwardly weak American aggressors continuing to expand their adventurous war in Korea can only lead them into a more passive and more dangerous situation. No matter how the American propaganda machine trumpets the success of this landing, the Washington dispatch of the United States Information Service on the 16th, in quoting the comments of various American bourgeois newspapers, could not hide the pessimistic tone. The dispatch quoted the Philadelphia Inquirer as commenting: "The current advance on Seoul will provoke serious fighting and will produce even more difficult battles." The New York Times also said: "It is foolish to think that the success of the landing operation will actually end the war." The newspaper admitted that "there are no huge armies that can be dispatched immediately." The United States Information Service dispatch also quoted the New York Herald Tribune as commenting: "The bet has been placed, and that's what's happening now, no matter how unclear the future is." However, we can be sure that the bet that American imperialism has placed in Korea is already destined to be lost completely. In the future protracted battle, the Korean people will surely win all the bets of the American aggressors.

### 美国侵略者的赌注是要输光的

　　美国侵略者的赌注是要输光的
    美国侵略者为了挽救它在进攻朝鲜的战争中已经遭受到的严重失败，正在按照着人们早已预料到的步骤，继续疯狂地进行冒险的军事赌博。在战贩麦克阿瑟经过了长时间的准备之后，美国侵略者集中了它手里现有的陆海空军的优势兵力于本月十五、十六两日，在朝鲜西部仁川港登陆，并向汉城侵犯。
    本报早在本年七月六日以《朝鲜人民解放战争的胜利前途》为题的社论中指出：美帝国主义在朝鲜还没有甘心失败下去，它正在继续增援，想继续扩大侵略，并且动员了英、澳、新西兰等国派兵助战，以挽救反革命战线的崩溃。当时我们更指出：这会使朝鲜人民的胜利来得慢些，使朝鲜人民不能不准备进行持续的和较为艰苦的战斗。我们曾以我国抗日战争和越南的抗法战争为例，证明即便经过长期艰苦的战争，胜利仍然是属于朝鲜人民的。现在朝鲜战局的发展，完全证明了我们的论断。
    显然的，美国侵略者现时在朝鲜的军事行动，完全是一个赌博。美帝国主义动员了这样大的武装力量来进攻朝鲜，只是更加暴露了美帝国主义的外强中干、极端脆弱和手忙脚乱。它虽然增加朝鲜人民走向胜利路上的困难，但决不能达到征服朝鲜人民的目的。美帝国主义在朝鲜的冒险有三个基本弱点：第一、美国侵略者及其走狗是全朝鲜人民的死敌，它们是完全孤立的；第二、后方太远；第三、士气不高。在持久的战争中，它是必然要狼狈地失败下去的。因此，朝鲜人民今后的斗争虽然是一个艰苦的持久的局面，但是，只要朝鲜人民继续团结一致，坚持持久的战争，并对持久战争作一切必要的准备，无论经过什么艰难曲折，最后胜利之属于朝鲜人民是毫无疑义的。
    外强中干的美国侵略者继续扩大在朝鲜的冒险战争的结果，只能把它自己陷入更加被动和更加危险的境地。尽管美国的宣传机关怎样吹嘘这次登陆的成功，但是，美国新闻处华盛顿十六日的电讯，在引述美国资产阶级各报的评论中，也无法掩盖悲观的论调。电讯引述费城问讯报的评论说：“目前向汉城的推进将引起严重的战斗，将产生甚至更困难的战役。”纽约时报也说：“认为登陆作战成功就实际结束了战争，是愚蠢的。”该报供认“并无庞大的军队可立时派遣。”美国新闻处的电讯还引述了纽约先驱论坛报的评论说：“赌注已经放下去了，这就是现在所发生的事，不管未来是怎样模糊不清。”但是，我们可以肯定，美帝国主义在朝鲜所放下的赌注，已经注定了是要输光的。朝鲜人民在今后持久的战斗中必将赢得美国侵略者的一切赌注。
