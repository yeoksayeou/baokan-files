Units Under Dalian and Lushun Electric Power Company

　　Serious Attention Paid to Security Work Results in Significant Reduction in Personal Injuries

　　Conscientious Safety Education is an Important Reason for Reducing Accidents

　　[This Newspaper News] According to news from the Dalian and Lushun People's Daily: The units under the Dalian and Lushun Far East Electric Power Company have achieved great success in reducing personal injuries due to their emphasis on technical safety and labor protection. Compared with the first half of this year and the first half of last year, personal injuries have decreased by 23%, loss of working days has decreased by 30%, and fatal accidents have decreased by 50%.

　　In order to strengthen technical safety work, the company has specially set up a technical safety director in both the production technology department and the line maintenance department to lead the technical safety work of their respective subordinate units. Each unit also has a technical safety section specifically responsible for studying and improving working conditions, increasing technical safety equipment, and distributing special work clothes and labor protection equipment.

　　In terms of safety equipment, all machines with belt equipment in each factory have belt guards. Large motors are surrounded by railings and fences. All machines with exposed gears are equipped with gearboxes. In order to prevent workers from being electrocuted due to starting the machine or not paying attention, the electric switches are equipped with wooden or glass boxes. Safe and sturdy railings are installed on stairs and suspended sections to prevent workers from accidentally falling down while working on them. Safety electric bells are also installed in the workshop, and a special person is responsible for pressing the electric bell before starting or stopping the machine so that workers can be prepared. Ventilation pipes are installed in workshops with high temperatures to regulate the indoor temperature. The company also distributes dozens of types of labor protection products to workers according to the nature of their work, such as special work clothes, gloves, masks, glasses, and leather shoes.

　　But more importantly, safety education has been conscientiously carried out for workers. In order to make every worker familiar with technical regulations and safe work methods, the workplace leader or workshop technician gives lectures in combination with the nature of the workshop's work. All staff in the workshop must participate. All personnel who have studied must sign and stamp on the prescribed form after the study. If an accident occurs in the future, responsibility should be investigated. In addition, each unit has also stipulated a system of regular study of safe work methods, such as once a week for metal machinery factories and glass factories, and once a month for soda factories. When new workers arrive at the factory, the workplace leader first introduces the technical safety regulations and safe work methods of the workshop in detail to the new workers. After the new workers are familiar with them, the workplace leader signs the prescribed safe work method study form before they can officially start work. The company's power transmission technology department also regularly tests safe operating methods. Those who fail the test will be demoted or reassigned. The company also has a strict reward and punishment system. If a personal injury accident occurs in any of the affiliated units, the chief technician, union representatives, etc. will organize an inspection committee to investigate the cause of the accident and investigate responsibility.

　　Editor's note: The Dalian and Lushun Electric Power Company's emphasis on technical safety and labor protection, especially the conscientious implementation of safety education, deserves the attention and study of leading cadres of factories and mines in various places. In many state-owned and public-private joint ventures, many accidents occur due to workers violating technical regulations, but the issue of safety education has still not received widespread attention and strengthening, causing some technical regulations to become mere formalities. According to the experience of Far East Electric Power, it is necessary to establish a safety organization and improve working conditions, but more importantly, workers must be familiar with technical regulations and safe work methods, otherwise workers should not be allowed to start work. For the benefit of workers and the country, such strict regulations are absolutely necessary.

### 旅大远电公司所属各单位  重视保安工作人身事故大减  认真进行安全教育是减少事故的重要原因

    重视保安工作人身事故大减
    认真进行安全教育是减少事故的重要原因
    【本报讯】据旅大人民日报消息：旅大远东电业公司所属各单位，由于重视了技术安全与劳动保护工作，在减少人身事故方面获得了很大的成绩。以今年上半年与去年上半年相比，人身事故减少百分之二十三，劳动日的损失减少百分之三十，死亡事故减少百分之五十。
    该公司为加强技术安全工作，特在生产技术部和线路保守部，各设技术安全主任一人，分别领导所属各单位的技术安全工作。各单位也都设有技术安全科，专门负责研究改善劳动条件，增加技术安全设备，发特殊工作服及劳动保护装备品等工作。
    在安全设备方面，各厂凡有皮带设备的机械，都有皮带网罩。大型电动机周围都有栏杆与围圈。一切齿轮露在外面的机器，都装置了齿轮盒子。为避免工人因开动机械或因注意不到而中电起见，电门都装备着木盒或玻璃盒子。在上下楼梯及悬空地段，都设备了安全坚固的栏杆，以防工人在上面工作时不小心跌下。车间内并设备安全电铃，开动或停止机器时，预先有专人负责按电铃，使工人都能作好准备。温度高的车间则设置了通风管子，以调剂室内温度。该公司又根据工作性质，发给工人特殊工作服、手套、口罩、眼镜、皮鞋等劳动保护用品数十种。
    但更重要的是认真地向工人进行了安全教育。为使每个工人都熟悉技术规则与安全工作法，由职场长或车间技师结合本车间的工作性质，进行讲课，车间所有工作人员都要参加，凡经学习的人员，在学习完后都要在规定的表格上签字盖章，今后如一旦发生事故时则应追究责任。此外，各单位并规定了经常学习安全工作法的制度，如金属机械厂和玻璃厂每星期一次，曹达厂每月一次。有新工人到厂时，首先由职场长对新工人详细介绍本车间的技术安全规则和安全工作法，俟新工人熟悉后，职场长即在规定的安全工作法学习表格上签字，然后才能正式上工。该公司送电技术部并经常测验安全作业法，如不合格者，即降级或调换工作。公司并订有严格的奖惩制度。所属各单位如发生人身事故时，即由主任技师、工会代表等组织检查委员会，检查发生事故的原因，追究责任。
    编者按：旅大远电公司重视技术安全与劳动保护，特别是认真进行安全教育一点，值得各地厂矿领导干部的重视和学习。在不少国公营厂矿中，由于工人违犯技术规则而发生的事故很多，但安全教育问题至今仍未能引起普遍的重视和加强，致使有些技术规则流于形式。根据远电经验证明：建立安全组织，改善劳动条件固属必要，但更重要的是工人必须熟悉技术规则和安全工作法，否则工人便不能上工。为了工人和国家的利益，这样严格的规定是完全必要的。
