　　North Vietnamese Newspapers Publish Commentaries
    Denouncing US Aircraft Intrusion into Our Airspace
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th] According to the Vietnam News Agency from North Vietnam: Major newspapers in North Vietnam last week all wrote articles denouncing the provocative behavior of US aircraft intruding into Chinese airspace.
    The Democratic Party of Vietnam's official newspaper, *The Independence News*, commented on China's note to the Security Council and the US government protesting the intrusion of US aircraft into Chinese airspace, stating: "The Vietnamese people fully support the resolute attitude of the Chinese government and people. The Chinese people have repeatedly expressed their love for peace, but at the same time, they have also expressed their unwavering determination to drive the American aggressors out of all of China. The Wall Street merchants who order their air bandits to intrude into Chinese airspace and massacre Chinese people must compensate for the losses they have caused." The article concluded: "American imperialism is shamelessly interfering in the internal affairs of the Chinese and Vietnamese people. They will receive new lessons from these people who are determined to fight to the final victory for complete liberation."

　　北越各报发表评论
    斥责美机侵我领空
    【新华社五日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：北越各大报上周均撰文斥责美机侵犯中国领空的挑衅行为。
    越南民主党机关报《独立报》评论中国向安理会和美国政府抗议美机侵犯中国领空的照会称：“越南人民完全支持中国政府和人民的坚决态度。中国人民曾一再表示他们爱好和平，但是同时他们也表示他们有把美国侵略者逐出全中国的坚定不移的决心。命令自己手下的空中强盗侵犯中国领空和屠杀中国人民的华尔街商人，必须赔偿他们所造成的损失。”该文最后指出：“美国帝国主义正在无耻地干涉中国人民和越南人民的内政。他们将从这些决心为完全解放而作战到最后胜利的人民那里得到新的教训。”
