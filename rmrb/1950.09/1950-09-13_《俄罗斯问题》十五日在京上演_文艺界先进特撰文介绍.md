The news of the Central Academy of Drama's Drama Troupe's public performance of "The Russian Question" has been reported in detail in this newspaper. Now, we have learned that the play has been decided to be performed at the Beijing Theater every night from the 15th of this month at 8 p.m.

Progressive figures in literary and art circles, including Mr. Guo Moruo, Mr. Mao Dun, Ms. Li Bozhao, and Mr. Wang Yaping, have all written articles introducing this performance. Mr. Guo pointed out in his article "This is the American Question" that "This points out a path for the American people." Mr. Mao Dun affirmed the significant political meaning of the play's performance, saying, "Without the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, it would be absolutely impossible for 'The Russian Question' to be performed in China." Comrade Li Bozhao said, "The playwright Simonov propagated a truth: there are two kinds of Americans, one is a small number of imperialist elements; the other is the same as people all over the world, loving the Soviet Union and world peace." Comrade Wang Yaping said, "To defeat the enemy, we must first understand the enemy. This famous play tells us how to recognize American imperialists and their conspiracies." He also hoped that workers, students, and the general public would go and see this famous play. These reviews are published in the performance special issue. It is also reported that the play has been fully recorded by the Central People's Broadcasting Station and will be broadcast soon.

    文艺界先进特撰文介绍
    中央戏剧学院话剧团公演《俄罗斯问题》的消息，前已详志本报，兹悉该剧已决定自本月十五日起，每晚八时在北京剧场上演。
    文艺界先进郭沫若、茅盾、李伯钊、王亚平诸先生均撰文介绍这次演出，郭先生在他的《这个是美国问题》一文中指出说：“这为美国人民指出了一条路。”茅盾先生肯定这个戏演出的重大政治意义，他说：“没有中国人民革命的胜利，《俄罗斯问题》在中国演出是绝不可能的。”李伯钊同志说：“剧作家西蒙诺夫宣传了一个真理，美国人有两种，一种是少数帝国主义分子；另一种则跟全世界人民一样的热爱苏联和世界和平。”王亚平同志则说：“要打垮敌人，首先要认识敌人。这部名剧正告诉我们如何认识美帝国主义者，以及他的阴谋所在。”他并且希望工人、学生、及广大市民都去看一看这个名剧。这些评论均在演出特刊上刊出。并闻该剧已由中央人民广播电台全部录音，即可播送。
