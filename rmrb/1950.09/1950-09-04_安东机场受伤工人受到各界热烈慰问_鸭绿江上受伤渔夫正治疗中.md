Xinhua News Agency, Andong: The eighteen workers at Andong Airport who were injured by strafing from American aircraft have been receiving a continuous stream of visitors offering condolences since being admitted to the Liaodong Provincial Hospital for treatment. Li Tao, Vice Chairman of the Liaodong Provincial People's Government, visited the injured workers on the very evening of their admission. The following day, Wang Haizhi, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Liaodong Provincial People's Government, Shi Ping, Secretary-General of the Liaodong Provincial Party Committee, Zhang Zhiying, Director of the Andong Civil Affairs Bureau, Li Minshan, Secretary of the Andong County Party Committee, and representatives from various people's organizations in Andong City organized a condolence delegation to visit them. A condolence delegation from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, as well as representatives from the Air Force Command and Political Department of the Northeast Military Region, arrived from Shenyang on September 1st and 2nd, respectively, to offer their condolences. The Andong City Wulongbei District People's Government and the village heads from the villages where the injured workers reside also visited the hospital to express their sympathy. The condolence delegations from all sectors brought large quantities of gifts, funds, and letters of sympathy. The Air Force Command and Political Department of the Northeast Military Region sent special letters of condolence to the families of Sun Yugui, Sun Zilin, Wang Guanzhong, and Li Xiuguo, workers who died in the American air raid at Andong Airport, and provided them with pensions.

The seven fishermen who were injured in the American air raid on the Yalu River on August 29th are currently receiving treatment and recuperating in our People's Government hospitals. Zhang Yunzhi and the other five fishermen who were injured on the river near Gulouzi Village were transported to the Andong Municipal Hospital for treatment on the evening the incident occurred. Zhang Yunzhi, who was seriously injured, had his right upper arm penetrated, with internal muscle tissue destroyed. The poison has spread throughout his body, and he has had a very high temperature for days, and has not yet been removed from the danger zone. Zhang Yunfu, who was injured by a bullet entering his right subclavian fossa, also has a slight injury to his right lung. According to doctors, if there is no abscess or morbid condition in the lungs, he should be discharged from the hospital in about a month. The other three lightly injured, Yang Decheng, Jia Yufa, and Chen Shengkui, are all recovering daily, and should be discharged from the hospital in one to one and a half months. The hospital is very concerned about their treatment and care, and has universally injected them with tetanus antitoxin, glucose, cardiotonics, penicillin, and other drugs. The fishermen Liang Zhongde and Li Dianchen, who were injured in the American air raid on the river east of Changdianhekou Village, were sent to the health center of our local People's Government in Lagu Shao for treatment after being injured. Li Dianchen was discharged the next day because his injuries were relatively minor. Liang Zhongde suffered a minor penetrating injury to his leg. The shrapnel has been removed, and he will be fully recovered in a month.
