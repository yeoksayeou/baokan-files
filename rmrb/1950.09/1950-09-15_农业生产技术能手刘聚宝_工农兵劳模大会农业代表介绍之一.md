　　Agricultural Production Technology Expert Liu Jubao
    ——One of the Agricultural Representatives to the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants and Soldiers
    ·Li Qianfeng·
    The implementation of land reform smashed the floodgates that hindered the development of farmers' wisdom and creativity. Liu Jubao from Nanliu Village, Lucheng County, is one of the advanced agricultural producers who emerged in the Taihang Mountains after land reform.
    This farmer, known as an expert in improving agricultural production techniques, had been farming for most of his life before the War of Resistance Against Japan, but he rarely thought about how to improve production techniques. At that time, he cultivated one mu of vegetable garden and nineteen mu of mountain land, his only hope being "favorable weather," enough to provide his family with basic necessities. Because he believed in "poverty or wealth, it's all predetermined." He couldn't name a single landlord or wealthy man who had become rich solely through their own hard work.
    After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people's democratic government was established in the Taihang Mountains, and after gradual rent reduction and liquidation, the feudal traditional concepts of Liu Jubao changed after the implementation of land reform. The examples of a large number of emancipated farmers becoming wealthy gave him an insight: the old society only benefited a few cunning, deceitful, and cruel bloodsuckers, but the door to happiness in the new society is open to every working person.
    The slogan put forward by many emancipated farmers in Nanliu Village was to turn the land into gold. Liu Jubao, who came from a vegetable gardening background, had more experience than the average farmer. At this time, he not only worked hard, but more importantly, he was able to begin to exert his talents in agricultural production technology. His first amazing achievement was to promote the early maturity of rice.
    Nanliu Village has a history of rice cultivation for who knows how many years, but how to promote the early maturity of rice in order to avoid pests, frost and other disasters has been an important issue that local farmers have not been able to solve for generations. Liu Jubao did not believe that this difficulty could not be overcome, and he decided to start researching from the genetic effects of crops. One day, he discovered three strange rice ears in the paddy field. Although these three ears were no different from the other ears in terms of variety, they were completely mature when the other ears were still developing and growing. Liu Jubao treasured, collected and preserved these three ears of seeds. In the second year, he planted them separately on the edge of the field. In order to increase the soil's heat, he used sheep manure instead of other fertilizers. In this way, through cultivation and expansion year by year, the maturity period of his entire rice field can now be advanced by half a month compared to other rice.
    Because Nanliu Village is close to the Zhuozhang River and irrigation is convenient, many garlic have been planted over the years. However, in the past, farmers' garlic harvests were always very small because the climate was cold, the garlic cloves could not be separated, and the garlic scapes could not grow until the seedlings died. In the past, farmers passively attributed this phenomenon to the wrong terrain. However, after various experiments, Liu Jubao found that this phenomenon should be changed from the planting time. So, one autumn, he buried the seeds in the ridges. At that time, this bold experiment seemed incredible to many conservative farmers. Some people said: "As the saying goes: plant garlic at the vernal equinox, not too early or too late. How can there be a reason to sow seeds the year before?" But in the second year, strong garlic scapes grew exceptionally in his garden, and his garlic cloves not only separated automatically, but also the yield exceeded the previous year by more than one time.
    In order to obtain the highest-yielding seeds, Liu Jubao often tried planting various crops with different varieties on the same piece of land. He once planted eight different varieties of millet in sections on one mu of land. After harvesting, he found that "Bailiusha" (a variety of millet) could yield 5% to 23% more grain than other varieties. He planted ten kinds of wheat in the same piece of land. The result of the harvest made him discover that the highest difference in yield between various varieties reached 70%. Later, he tested ten kinds of fertilizers commonly used by farmers in the same wheat field. Although these fertilizers were equal in quantity, the harvest of wheat per building using sheep manure was 2.5 jin, while using local fertilizer only yielded 15 liang per building.
    Many stories about Liu Jubao are now circulating in the Zhuozhang River basin. He inoculated many fruit trees for various villages along the river. The most peculiar thing is that the owners often didn't know when these fruit trees were inoculated. When he passed by a village and saw a sour jujube or other worthless small tree growing on the edge of the field, he would take out his knife and quietly graft another fruit tree branch onto it. Therefore, when the newly grafted small tree was discovered by the owner, it often caused a misunderstanding: "Which naughty child broke my black dates?" But when they later discovered a fat persimmon tree growing on the black date tree, they were both surprised and happy. Nanliu Village had never grown walnuts before. One winter, Liu Jubao enthusiastically bought two thousand walnuts from the market to promote. However, after he distributed the seeds to each household, many farmers gave them to their children to eat. "The person who plants the tree will not live to eat the walnuts," some farmers still believed in this superstitious saying. Liu Jubao bought another two thousand walnuts the following year and planted them all by the pool himself. After the walnuts came out, he mobilized the whole village to transplant them on the one hand, and cited many facts to expose that ignorant rumor on the other hand.
    Liu Jubao's house is decorated like an exhibition hall, with various ears of millet, ears of wheat, bean pods and all kinds of fine seeds occupying the entire wall. The slogan "Learn from the technical expert Liu Jubao" is written all over the large and small villages around Lucheng. This 65-year-old farmer who does not know a single character replied humorously when people called him a technical expert: "I only paid attention to technology a few years ago. In the future, when you reach my age, everyone will be technical experts!"

　　农业生产技术能手刘聚宝
    ——工农兵劳模大会农业代表介绍之一
    ·李千峰·
    土地改革的实施，冲破了阻碍农民智慧和创造力发展的闸门。潞城县南流村刘聚宝，就是太行山区土地改革以后源源涌现的农业生产先进分子之一。
    这个被称为改良农业生产技术能手的农民，抗战前虽然已经种了大半辈子庄稼，但是如何改进生产技术连想都很少想到，那时他种着一亩菜园和十九亩山地，唯一的希望是“老天爷风调雨顺”，给全家赚个温饱。因为他所相信的是“过穷过富，命里有数”。他搬着指头数不出有一家地主老财是全凭自己勤劳起家的。
    抗战以后，太行山区建立了人民民主政权，逐步地经过减租清算，实施了土地改革以后，刘聚宝的封建传统观念改变了。大批农民翻身发家致富的例子使他得到一个启示：旧社会只便宜了少数狡猾、诡诈、残暴的吸血鬼们，新社会的幸福大门却是朝向每个劳动人民开着的。
    南流村许多翻身农民提出的口号是要把土地变成金。这个种菜园子出身的刘聚宝有着比一般农民更多的经验，这时他不仅勤苦地劳动，而更重要的是他已经能够开始发挥他在农业生产技术上的才智。他做出的第一件惊人的成绩是促进稻子早熟。
    南流村种稻子的历史已有不知多少年代，但如何促进稻子早熟，以便免受虫冻等灾害，却是多少世代以来当地农民没得到解决的重要问题。刘聚宝不相信这个困难不能够克服，他决心从作物的遗传作用上着手研究。有一天他在稻田里发现了三个奇怪的谷穗。这三个穗子品种虽然和其余的穗子没有区别，但当其他的穗子还在发育成长的时候，它们却已经完全成熟了。刘聚宝珍贵地采集和保存了这三穗种子。到第二年，他便把它们单独地在地边上种起来。为了增加土地热量，他使用羊粪代替其他肥料。这样，逐年培植、逐年扩大，现在他整片稻田的成熟期已能较其他稻子提前半个月的光景。
    南流村因为临近浊漳河，灌溉方便，所以历年种蒜的很多。但过去农民种蒜收获量总是很小，原因是气候寒冷，蒜头不能分瓣，同时蒜苔到苗儿枯死都不能生长出来。农民过去只是把这种现象消极地归结到地势不对。但刘聚宝经过种种试验以后，却发现应该从种植时间上来改变这种现象。于是，有一年秋后，他便把种子埋在畦里。当时，这种大胆的试验在许多保守的农民看来是不可思议的。有人说：“俗话说：春分种蒜，不早不晚。那有头一年下种的道理？”但第二年他园子里破例地生长出了茁壮的蒜苔，他的蒜头不仅自动分开了瓣，而且产量超过往年一倍以上。
    刘聚宝为了要得到一种收获量最高的种籽，他往往在同一块土地上试种起各种品种不同的作物。他曾在一亩地里分段种植了八种不同品种的谷子，收获以后发现“白流沙”（一种品种的谷子）比其他的品种可以多收百分之五到百分之二十三的粮食。他在同样一块地里分种了十种小麦，收获的结果使他发现各种品种的产量最高差额竟达到百分之七十。以后，他又在同样一块麦地里试验了十种农民通常使用的肥料，这些肥料虽然在数量上相等，但使用羊粪的每楼麦子的收获量是二斤五两，用土肥的每楼只能收到十五两。
    浊漳河流域现在流传着许多关于刘聚宝的故事。他替沿河各个村庄接种了很多果树。最奇特的是当这些果树被接种了以后，主人往往并不知道。他路过一个村庄，见到一棵酸枣或是其他一棵不值钱的小树在地边上长着，于是他顺手掏出刀子悄悄地给它接上了另外一种果树的枝条。因此，当刚刚接过的小树被主人发现的时候往往引起一阵误会：“谁家的坏孩子折断了我的黑枣？”但当后来他们发现黑枣树上长出一枝肥大的柿树的时候，心里又惊奇又高兴。南流村过去从来没有种胡桃的。有一年冬天，刘聚宝兴致勃勃地从集上买回了两千个胡桃来推广。但他把种籽发给每家以后，不少农民却分给小孩吃了。“种树的不死不结胡桃”，有些农民们还在相信着这种迷信的说法。刘聚宝第二年又买了两千个胡桃，自己在水池边统统栽种起来。胡桃出来以后，他一面发动全村的人移栽，一面举了许多事实揭破那种愚昧的流言。
    刘聚宝屋子里布置得像一个陈列馆，各种谷穗、麦穗、豆角以及一切优良品种的种子占据了整个墙壁。“学习技术能手刘聚宝”的标语写遍了潞城一带的大小乡村。这个六十五岁年纪一个字不识的农民在人家称他技术能手的时候，他很幽默地回答：“我注意技术才没有几年，将来你们到我这年纪个个都是技术能手了！”
