Beijing Public May Fourth Hospital Writes to Accept Readers' Criticism

The Letter of Criticism from Zhou Yisong and Others

To the Editors:

Recently, when the May Fourth Hospital in Beijing was injecting citizens with cholera prevention vaccines, some people experienced swelling at the injection site and fevers as high as 39 degrees Celsius due to the lack of responsibility of the staff. Some even developed pus and had to undergo surgery. For example, the Xing family in Cihuidian had six people injected at once, and all six became ill. When they sent someone to inquire at the hospital, the reply was: "There's nothing we can do about it. The vaccine we used was issued by a higher authority, and the injection dosage is standard. If there are problems, it's not our responsibility!" They were unwilling to conduct an in-depth review. This attitude is very bad. We hope the hospital will conduct a thorough investigation and provide a public response in the newspaper.

The May Fourth Hospital's Self-Criticism

To the Editors:

In response to the Public Health Bureau's call for summer cholera prevention injections, our hospital provided free cholera prevention vaccines to nearby residents starting in July. At the beginning of the injections, everything went well. However, in the last week of August, some adverse reactions occurred. Initially, we thought the reactions were common after the second injection; however, eventually, four people developed localized pus due to the injections. Only then did we realize that we had made a mistake.

On August 29th, we held a general meeting of all staff at the hospital to examine this matter. We believe that the localized pus was caused by bacteria in the injection fluid. A testing report from Peking University Hospital has confirmed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The injection fluid was good when it was delivered, as there were no reactions when we first used this bottle of medicine. The bacteria were introduced during repeated extraction; and the purulent reaction was caused by the contaminated injection fluid, not by improper disinfection of the syringes during individual injections. This is because the reaction affected several people, not just one, and it did not happen on a single day.

We estimate that there are two reasons why Pseudomonas aeruginosa entered the vaccine: First, the assistant nurse inserted a needle into the rubber stopper of the injection fluid bottle every day when using the medicine, and then extracted the medicine. After taking the medicine, she left the needle on the stopper. The second time she took the medicine, she still extracted it with this needle. She thought that this could avoid the risk of introducing bacteria into the bottle due to repeated needle insertions into the stopper and that it would be more convenient to extract the medicine. However, she forgot to cover the needle with sterile cotton. Therefore, it is possible that bacteria-carrying dust entered the needle and eventually entered the bottle. Second, after using the medicine, the bottle was not placed in the refrigerator, which allowed the already entered bacteria to multiply.

In short, we at the May Fourth Hospital should take full responsibility for this mistake. We did not recognize in advance that preventive injection is a political task of the hospital. As a result, we did not have detailed plans at the beginning of preventive injection and did not check at any time during the injection. Secondly, we did not do enough to educate and help our staff, so that when they discovered the reaction, they did not immediately report it to the leadership, and they were not willing to humbly admit their mistakes and comfort the patients who had reactions. Instead, they made irresponsible remarks. This is a manifestation of a lack of the spirit of serving the people.

Mr. Zhou's letter has been very helpful to our work. After receiving his letter, we held another review meeting on the afternoon of September 5th and deeply reviewed our mistakes. We guarantee that similar mistakes will not happen again in the future. We must improve our sense of responsibility and improve our medical work. In addition, we are responsible for treating anyone whose injection site has developed pus due to injections at our hospital. Please come directly to the hospital for treatment.

### 北京公立五四医院来信接受读者批评

　　北京公立五四医院来信接受读者批评
    周以松等的批评信编辑同志：
    日前，本市五四医院为市民注射霍乱预防疫苗时，因工作人员责任心差，有部分人在注射以后，针眼肿大，身体发烧达三十九度；甚至有化脓必须开刀动手术的。如慈慧殿邢家一次注射了六个人。六个人都病了。打发人去问该院，他们的答复是：“这可没办法。我们所用的药苗，是上级发下来的；注射量也有标准。出了毛病，那可不是我们的责任！”他们不肯作深入的检讨。这种作风是很不好的。希望该院深入检查，并在报纸上公开答复。
              周以松、周以德、周以瑞
　　五四医院的检讨编辑同志：
    本院为了响应公共卫生局夏季霍乱预防注射的号召，七月份起曾为附近居民免费注射霍乱预防疫苗。开始注射的时候，一切都很好。可是在八月中旬最后一星期内，就有发生不良反应的。起先以为反应是第二针注射后常见的现象；可是最后竟有四个人因注射而发生局部化脓。这才知道我们有了错误。
    八月二十九日，我们召开本院职工全体大会，对于这事加以检查。认为局部化脓是因为注射液内有菌苗而发生的。北大医院对药液的检查报告已证明有绿脓杆菌。注射液发来的时候是好的，因为开始用这瓶药的时候并没有反应。菌苗是在屡次吸取时带进去的；而化脓的反应是由有菌的注射液引起的，并不是在个别注射时因注射器消毒不净而发生的。因为引起反应的是数人不是一个人，而且不是在一天内发生的。
    绿脓杆菌渗入疫苗的原因，我们估计有两个：第一、助理护士在每日用药的时候，把一个针头插入注射液瓶口的橡皮塞上，然后吸取药水。药取出后便将这针头留在塞上。第二次取药的时候还由这针头吸取。她以为这样可以避免因屡次插针到瓶塞以致引菌入瓶的危险，而且吸药方便些。可是她却忘了用消毒的棉花把针头盖好。所以可能因有带菌的尘土进入针口，最后带到瓶里面去。第二、用完药后未曾把药瓶放在冰箱里，这样使已入瓶的杂菌有了繁殖的机会。
    总之，对这次错误，我们五四医院应当负完全责任。我们事先未认识到预防注射乃是医院的一个政治任务，因而对于预防注射开始时没有详密的计划，注射时又没有随时检查。其次，我们对工作人员的教育帮助做得不够，以致在他们发现反应时不立刻向领导上报告，对于有反应的病友也不肯虚心认错，并安慰他们，反而说出不负责任的话。这是缺乏为人民服务的精神的表现。
    周先生的信，对我们的工作很有帮助。我们于接到他的来信以后，又在九月五日下午开了一次检讨会，深刻的检讨了自己的错误。我们保证以后不再发生类似的错误。我们要提高工作责任心，改善我们的医疗工作。此外，凡经本院注射局部化脓的人，我们负责为他们治疗，请他们径来医院洽治。
