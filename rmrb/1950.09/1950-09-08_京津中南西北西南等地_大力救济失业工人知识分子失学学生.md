Beijing, Tianjin, Central South, Northwest, Southwest and other places
Vigorously relieve unemployed workers, intellectuals, and out-of-school students
[Report from this newspaper] Beijing, Tianjin, and major cities in Central South, Northwest, and Southwest China are actively carrying out work to relieve unemployed workers, unemployed intellectuals, and out-of-school students.
From July 24 to August 26, 5,580 unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals registered in various urban and suburban districts of Beijing. The Beijing Unemployed Workers Relief Office organized them to participate in work-for-relief projects, production for self-salvation, returning to their hometowns for production, vocational training, or issued relief funds. As of the 26th, the office had issued various relief funds equivalent to 16,824 jin of millet.
The work of relieving unemployed workers in Tianjin, Guangxi Province, and major cities in the Northwest is continuing actively. As of around August 20, more than 10,600 of the 20,358 registered unemployed workers in Tianjin, 10,000 of the more than 15,400 unemployed workers in Guangxi Province, and more than 6,000 of the more than 7,000 unemployed workers in Dihua have participated in work-for-relief projects such as road construction and levee repair, other work, or have switched to other occupations, returned to their hometowns for production, and received relief funds.
In the work of relieving unemployed workers, Tianjin Municipality's progress has been slow because most of the main cadres are part-time and lack sufficient preparation, so half of the unemployed workers have not yet received work and relief, and many of those who have participated in work-for-relief have been unable to continue to receive work. In the Northwest region, the work was once passive because some leading organs did not pay attention to it in time.
Regarding the relief of unemployed intellectuals, under the leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Unemployed Teachers and Staff Relief Committee, the registration of unemployed teachers and staff has been basically completed. As of the 23rd, a total of more than 800 people have registered. Some have participated in study sessions for unemployed teachers and staff, and after graduation, some will serve as cultural teachers in vocational and spare-time schools; the Northeast Recruitment Group plans to recruit 600 middle school teachers in Wuhan, and some unemployed teachers will apply to teach; some have received subsidies; some can still maintain their lives and, after receiving registration certificates, are waiting for job introductions. At the same time, the Municipal Relief Committee has contacted the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, and in the future, when public and private schools hire more teachers, they will give priority to employing unemployed teachers.
In Guangzhou, of the 3,095 teachers, literary and art workers, and medical personnel registered in the first phase, more than 2,000 have received more than 100,000 jin of relief grain. In addition, 200 primary and secondary school teachers participated in a teacher summer study class, and 50 of them have already found employment after studying. The Municipal Relief Committee is now planning long-term relief, opening training classes, or introducing them to rural areas lacking teachers for employment.
The People's Revolutionary University and various training classes held by provinces and regions in the Southwest have solved the unemployment problem of some intellectuals and trained them to become cadres for future work. The Northeast Recruitment Group and various military cultural work troupes have also absorbed many unemployed intellectuals. At present, the People's Government has begun to carry out registration work, preparing to solve the problems of unemployment and dropping out of school in a planned manner.
In order to solve the problem of students dropping out of school, the Wuhan Municipal Democratic Youth Federation and the Cultural Center have respectively held youth study classes, giving more than 930 out-of-school students the opportunity to study; among them, nearly 400 have been admitted to the People's Revolutionary University or have found jobs after preliminary political study. The Hubei Provincial Department of Culture and Education and the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education have both made decisions requiring all middle schools under their jurisdiction to universally recruit transfer students (except for the second semester of the third grade), and out-of-school students can apply. Each middle school in Hubei Province has added a class. The Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education also plans to pilot people's scholarships in three better private middle schools. The Southwest region is establishing people's scholarships in schools to help students who cannot afford to go to school continue their studies. Registration work is currently underway.

　　京津中南西北西南等地
    大力救济失业工人知识分子失学学生
    【本报讯】北京、天津及中南、西北、西南各主要城市积极展开救济失业工人、失业知识分子和失学学生的工作。
    北京市失业工人和失业知识分子，从七月二十四日到八月二十六日，在城郊各区登记的，有五千五百八十人。京市失业工人救济处分别组织他们参加工赈工程、生产自救、还乡生产、转业训练，或核发救济金。截至二十六日止，该处已发出各种救济金折合小米一万六千八百二十四斤。
    天津市、广西省和西北各主要城市的救济失业工人工作，正在继续积极进行。截至八月二十日左右，天津登记的二万零三百五十八名失业工人中的一万零六百多人，广西省一万五千四百余失业工人中的一万人，迪化七千多失业工人中的六千多人，都参加了筑路、修堤等工赈工程和其他工作，或者转业、还乡生产和得到了救济金。
    在救济失业工人工作中，天津市由于主要干部多半是兼职，缺乏充分准备，所以工作进展不快，到现在还有一半失业工人没有得到工作和救济，而已参加工赈的，也有不少不能继续得到工作。西北区也由于若干领导机关没有及时予以重视，曾在一个时期中工作陷于被动。
    关于救济失业知识分子，武汉市在失业教职员救济委员会的领导下，失业教职员的登记工作已基本完成。截至二十三日止，共登记八百余人。有的参加了失业教职员讲习会进行学习，结业后一部分将担任职工业余学校文化教员；东北招聘团拟在武汉招聘中学教师六百人，一部分失业教师将应征前往任教；有的得到补助救济；有的生活尚能维持，领到登记证后，等候介绍职业。同时该市救济委员会已和市文教局取得联系，今后各公、私立学校增聘教师时，将尽先录用失业教师。
    广州市失业教师、文艺工作者和医务人员，第一期登记的三千零九十五人中，已有两千多人得到救济粮共十万多市斤。另有二百名中小学教师参加了教师暑期学习班，学习后五十人已经就业。现该市救济委员会正在筹办长期救济，开设训练班，或介绍到教师缺乏的农村去就业。
    西南区各省区举办的人民革命大学和各种训练班，解决了部分知识分子失业问题，并把他们培养成为今后各项工作的干部。东北招聘团和各部队文工团也吸收了不少失业知识分子。目前人民政府已开始进行登记工作，准备有步骤地解决失业、失学问题。
    为了解决学生失学问题，武汉市民主青年联合会和文化馆分别举办了青年学习班，使九百三十余失学学生得到学习机会；其中近四百人经初步政治学习，已考入人民革命大学或已找到职业。湖北省文教厅及武汉市文教局并且都作出决定，要求所属各中学普遍招收插班生（三年级下学期除外），失学学生可以投考。湖北省属各中学都增设一班。武汉市文教局并计划在三个较好的私立中学内，试办人民助学金。西南地区在学校中设立人民助学金，帮助无力上学的学生继续学习。现正进行登记工作。
