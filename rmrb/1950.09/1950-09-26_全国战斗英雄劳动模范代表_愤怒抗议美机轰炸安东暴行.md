National Combat Heroes and Labor Model Representatives
    Angrily Protest the U.S. Bombing of Andong Atrocities
    Northwest Military Region and First Field Army Hero Representatives
    Firmly Believe That Under the Wise Leadership of Chairman Mao, the Red Flag of Liberation Will Surely Be Planted on Taiwan

The U.S. imperialists' renewed frantic bombing of our territory, killing and wounding our people, has aroused great anger among the combat heroes.  Lu Shunbao, a special-class hero of the First Field Army, said angrily: "I am an artilleryman, and our People's Liberation Army's artillery is accurate. If the U.S. imperialists come again, they will surely eat artillery shells. We support Foreign Minister Zhou's accusations against the U.S. imperialists to the United Nations, but we also hope that Chairman Mao will order us to liberate Taiwan as soon as possible." Zhang Ba, a renowned explosive hero in the army, warned the U.S. imperialists: "Come and try our strength, and you will surely find it unpleasant." Liu Sihu, a special-class hero, stated in his written statement: "The economic crisis in the United States is like a landmine that will eventually explode. If they continue to recklessly invade others, they are looking for an early death, and we will certainly help them die early." La Denov, a Uyghur hero who came all the way from Xinjiang, said: "The U.S. imperialists want to scare people, but who is afraid? The people of all ethnic groups in China are united under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and can overcome any instigation by aggressors." When everyone talked about the U.S. imperialists directing U.S. planes to carry out such shameless atrocities, they could not help but frown with anger. Lu Shunbao, Zhang Ba, Hu Qingshan, Ma Yisheng, and Huang Defang, a female model worker from the Northwest Military Region, all said disdainfully: "The comrades of the People's Liberation Army all know that the air force cannot play a major role. Our countless past experiences have proved this point. The best proof is the failure of the U.S. imperialists to help Chiang Kai-shek launch a civil war." Finally, they unanimously expressed that they would better improve their skills, intensify their training, and strive to learn culture. They firmly believe that with Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the close unity of our 475 million people, our strength is like steel. If the U.S. imperialists really come into contact with us, it will be like an egg hitting a rock. They are even more convinced that the day when our red flag of liberation will be planted on Taiwan is not far away.

    Northwest Region Labor Model Representatives Express They Will Not Allow U.S. Imperialism to Invade an Inch of Our Land

The representatives of the Northwest Labor Model Delegation felt extremely angry when they heard that Andong City on our northeastern border was suffering from frantic U.S. bombing.  Liu Yuhou, an old hero who participated in the presidium of this National Congress of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers Labor Model Representatives, said indignantly: We will never allow U.S. imperialism to invade our Chinese land.  We Chinese have 475 million people and friends led by the Soviet Union. How can we let the US imperialism invade China? If US imperialism invades an inch of our Chinese land, we will fight it desperately.  The labor model Liu Jianzhang followed up and said: Today, the US imperialism bombed Andong City on our northeastern border. We resolutely oppose it. The more united the Chinese people are, the less they fear US imperialism. In the past, hundreds of thousands of Hu Zongnan bandit troops burned and killed our border compatriots. Under the leadership of our Chairman Mao, the Hu bandits were driven away in a few days! Today I saw Zhang Shuyi, the honorary soldier flag of Hebei Province, at the conference. He insisted on production without his legs. The strength of our Chinese people is great, and we are not afraid of the US imperialist paper tiger. Liang Xiuying, a female labor model in the border area, puffed out her chest and said in a loud voice: A few days before I arrived in Beijing, I launched more than 300 women in our village to participate in the peace signature, which is a protest against the US imperialism. In the past, I was almost buried alive by the Hu Zongnan bandit troops. Today, the US imperialism killed our northeastern compatriots and destroyed many houses and vegetable gardens of the common people. My eyes are red when I see the enemy! The strength of our women is great. If the US imperialism dares to provoke the Chinese people, all the women in China will unite to overthrow it. The Tibetan labor model representative could not speak Chinese, but in this atmosphere of indignation, he could also appreciate the emotions of other representatives who hated US imperialism. He said: I will keep everything in my heart and tell the people in the Tibetan areas in Tibetan language. They must closely unite under the banner of Mao Zedong to defeat imperialism and liberate Tibet as soon as possible.

    The representatives unanimously stated: They will write letters to their hometowns to inform them of the US imperialists' invasion of Andong City, asking them to unite, step up production, and support our army to defeat US imperialism.

    Northwest Minority Nationalities Labor Model Representatives Call on All Ethnic Groups to Unite and Combat U.S. Imperialism

The Northwest Minority Nationalities Labor Model Representatives issued written opinions protesting the U.S. imperialist aggression, stating:

    The war on the mainland of our country has basically ended, but the brutal U.S. imperialists continue to bomb our territory, kill and injure our compatriots, and invade our Taiwan.

    Compatriots! Brothers and sisters of all ethnic groups! Under the leadership of the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China, let us unite as hard as steel and as strong as iron. If the U.S. imperialists dare to invade us, let them see the fate of Japanese imperialism!

    Fathers, brothers, sisters of all ethnic groups! Hold hands tightly, let us raise thousands of iron fists to the sky, and let the imperialists tremble before us! We shout:

    Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the unity of all ethnic groups! Long live world peace! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

    Southwest Military Region and Second Field Army All Hero Representatives
    Issue Personally Signed Written Opinions, Vowing to Strive to Achieve Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement.

After learning about the crime of U.S. imperialism once again violating our northeastern airspace, the Southwest Military Region and the Second Field Army Combat Hero Delegation, all the representatives issued personally signed written opinions, expressing that they would vow to unite the officers and soldiers of the entire army to strive for the realization of Foreign Minister Zhou's demands and would never stop until the goal was achieved. The original text is as follows:

    We feel extremely angry at the fact that the US imperialism disregarded the protests of the Chinese people and repeatedly violated the airspace of our northeast with the US military aircraft invading Korea, bombing and strafing the lives and property of our people, and destroying our construction. We firmly support the Central People's Government's Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai's successive accusations and demands to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Security Council, and the Fifth United Nations General Assembly since last month, to include this incident on the agenda of the conference and invite our representatives to attend the discussion, expel the illegal Chiang Kai-shek bandit representative, in order to achieve a swift and fair resolution. We firmly support the just demand that "the US aggression forces against Korea must be withdrawn immediately", and we will never allow the US aggressive armed forces to remain in Taiwan. We vow to unite the officers and soldiers of the entire army to strive for the realization of Foreign Minister Zhou's demands, and we will never stop until the goal is achieved. We have full confidence and strength to defend our national defense, defend peace in Asia and the world. We extend our warm greetings to the brothers and sisters who were injured in Andong City this time and several times before due to the bombing by US aircraft.

    Southwest Military Region and Second Field Army Combat Hero Delegation All Representatives (signed) September 25

    Southwest Labor Model Representatives Determined to Work Hard to Produce and Support the Front

Wu Kunshan, a Southwest Region Labor Model Representative, an old worker and factory-protecting hero, expressed his opinion: "I hate the atrocities of U.S. imperialism very much, and I resolutely protest the U.S. planes' killing of our Chinese people. I will definitely lead the workers in our factory to work hard to produce and support the front, so that our People's Liberation Army can continue to advance victoriously under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, liberate Taiwan and Tibet, and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gangs. We will never allow U.S. imperialism to invade our country again and kill our Chinese people."

    Yue Songshan, a young worker and model for rationalization proposals, said: The fighting at the front depends on our People's Liberation Army, and the great production in the rear depends on our workers and peasants. Our workers and peasants must do their best to support the front and build our new China.

    In addition, Wang Zhengliang, a Sichuan farmer labor model representative and an active initiator of the peace signature movement, and Yang Jiagu, a Yunnan farmer labor model representative, also expressed their determination to actively produce and support the front.

    Combat Heroes of East China Hate the U.S. and are Determined to Fully Prepare to Liberate Taiwan

Combat heroes in East China unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement.

    Shooting hero Wei Laiguo said: When the U.S. imperialists invaded our northeastern airspace in August, I immediately expressed my protest. Yesterday I saw the news of the U.S. imperialist planes attacking Andong City again, which made me even more angry. Speaking from my heart, I really want to beat them severely. I firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will definitely resolutely, thoroughly, and decisively eliminate the aggressors who dare to attack China.

    Combat hero Zhang Ming said: Imperialism itself is war. The series of actions by U.S. imperialism in invading Korea and Taiwan are all attempts to wantonly provoke war. We must be vigilant and make full preparations. U.S. imperialism is soft on the hard and afraid of the strong. As long as we are prepared, we are confident that we can completely eliminate the invaders.

    Tank hero Shen Xu said: The more the U.S. imperialists' aggressive behavior is exposed, the more it enhances the anger and close unity of peace-loving people all over the world. The comrades of our troops must strengthen their political and military studies and actively prepare to liberate Taiwan.

    Model nurse Li Landing said: I fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. The U.S. imperialist planes helped the Kuomintang reactionaries bomb the Chinese liberated areas, causing the Chinese people to suffer deeply. According to many bombed compatriots I have seen with my own eyes, the tragic situation is unbearable to witness. Now the U.S. imperialist planes have come to attack our Chinese airspace again. In addition to resolutely protesting, we must take practical actions to fully prepare to liberate Taiwan. As long as Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu give the order, we will take action immediately.

    Combat Heroes of the Fourth Field Army Firmly Believe They Can Defeat U.S. Imperialism

The heroes of the Fourth Field Army who attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes Representatives held a forum. At the meeting, the heroes expressed their indignation at the aggressive behavior of U.S. imperialism and their determination to defend the sacred motherland.

    Zhao Xingyuan, who was elected as the captain of the hero team of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army and led the team to attend the National Congress of Combat Heroes Representatives, was particularly angry at the U.S. imperialists' criminal behavior. He said: "The people will not be able to live in peace without eliminating the U.S. imperialist aggressors. We have shed blood for the liberation of the people ravaged by the Japanese invaders and Chiang bandits. We can no longer allow the U.S. imperialists to act so fiercely. I am determined to stand forever on the forefront of the motherland as a people's fighter. If the U.S. imperialists dare to invade us, we will treat them like we treated Japanese imperialism and the Chiang bandits - eliminate them." Cui Yongfeng, a people's artilleryman who had made six great achievements and won the glorious title of combat hero, said: "In addition to supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's just protest to the United Nations, we also ask Chairman Mao to send troops when necessary." Li Guangzheng, the deputy company commander of a famous model sharp knife company of a certain regiment of the Fourth Field Army who won the "Mao Zedong Medal" and attended the All-China Youth Congress, said excitedly: "We have exchanged blood and sweat for the people's happiness today; we will not allow anyone to destroy our happy life. We have the confidence to defeat the aggressors, and we have the strength to protect our compatriots and the sacred border of our motherland. We demand that the United Nations General Assembly stop the aggressive behavior of U.S. imperialism. We ask Chairman Mao to give us the task of liberating Taiwan." Tian Guangwen, an outstanding combat hero, said: "We have created a new country, and we have the power to protect her; we have already established the idea of ​​always being a combat team, and we want to show the invincible fighting spirit of the people's soldiers in front of the U.S. imperialism." Wang Fengjiang, a combat hero who has made seven great achievements and two small achievements, said: "The U.S. imperialists used to provide money and guns to help the Kuomintang. Now that the Chiang bandits are no longer working, he tore off his mask and showed his face. But we will not be intimidated. We have the vast people of all peace-loving and democratic countries led by the Soviet Union. We have more confidence in defeating the U.S. imperialist aggression than we did in eliminating Chiang Kai-shek."

    Hero Representatives of the Northeast Military Region Express Their Readiness to Eliminate Aggressors at All Times

A few hours before the opening of the National Congress of Combat Heroes Representatives on the 25th, the heroes of the Northeast Military Region attending the meeting held a forum to protest the U.S. aircraft invading our airspace. They unanimously expressed their extreme hatred for the atrocities of the U.S. imperialist air force invading our airspace again and bombing the urban area of ​​Andong City. He Guishun, a bombing hero of the 42nd Army, said: "We firmly oppose this arrogant and sinful behavior of U.S. imperialism. Peace-loving people all over the world can see very clearly that this new aggressive behavior of U.S. imperialism clearly exposes their face of destroying world peace." Zhang Linying, a model automobile technician from the Transportation Regiment of the Northeast Logistics Department, said: I can represent the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to express my firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest with all our strength. The UN General Assembly must include the crime of US planes invading our airspace on the agenda of the conference; must allow our representatives to attend and participate in the discussion and severely punish the murderers. Combat hero Yang Hai said: Our People's Liberation Army has the obligation and the power to defend the sacred national defense of the motherland. Chairman Mao once told us that "we are always a combat team." We are always ready to eliminate the aggressors who invade our territory. Jiang Xinliang, a special-class meritorious officer of the 42nd Army, said: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we have rich combat experience and combat strength. We not only have the power to defend national defense, but also have the power to defend peace in Asia and the world in unity with the Soviet Union and various democratic countries. Finally, all the heroes said: We will bring back the experience gained at this conference, study hard, improve our existing military level, and be a model soldier on the front line of consolidating national defense and defending world peace.

    Northeast Labor Model Lu Xingwen Protests U.S. Bombing

Northeast Labor Model Representative Lu Xingwen wrote a letter to this newspaper saying: The U.S. imperialist planes' invasion of our Andong City airspace truly exposed the U.S. imperialists' aggressive intentions. Our working class hates this atrocity very much. We must step up production, study hard, and increase our strength to oppose the U.S. aggressors and maintain lasting world peace in the future.

    Heroic Model Representatives of the Navy, Air Force, and Railway Corps
    Solemnly Warn the U.S. Imperialism: The Old Trick of Intimidation Will Not Work; War Provocateurs Will Taste Our Iron Fist.

Han Jinde, the navy representative attending the National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Labor Model Representatives, expressed great anger at the U.S. imperialists' barbaric behavior of repeatedly violating our airspace. He said: "The US planes' invasion of our northeastern airspace is by no means an accidental event, but a planned aggressive act by the US imperialism. At the same time, it just shows that this is the crazy act of the US imperialism on the eve of its death after its failure to invade Korea, exposing the intimidating tricks of the US imperialist paper tiger. Of course, this crazy move not only cannot scare us; it can only make us see through his ferocious face even more and make people all over the world recognize his aggressive nature even more. The Chinese people love peace, so Foreign Minister Zhou has repeatedly expressed his willingness to bring this incident to the UN Security Council for resolution. We fully support and support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn protest. But if the U.S. imperialism still does not know what is good for him, as long as Chairman Mao gives the order, all our navy soldiers will definitely stand on the forefront of national defense and defend our sacred territory and sovereignty." Air Force representative Ma Deyou said: "I was very angry when the US imperialist planes invaded Andong last time. Now it has repeatedly come to bully us, I can warn the US imperialists in advance: The young Chinese People's Air Force is not to be bullied. Even though we don't have many in number, we have the courage and strong fighting spirit that the US imperialism doesn't have. As long as the superiors give the order, we are determined to fight him, and we will never let him invade us again." Li Dexin, a seaman worker who participated in the cross-sea operation, said: "If the US imperialism comes to provoke again, our workers will not only support the front on the production front, but also directly participate in the war. There have already been many such examples in the various battles in Hainan Wanshan. Don't think that the US imperialists have strong ships and powerful guns. Isn't Chiang Kai-shek's navy also equipped with US equipment? But the facts have repeatedly proved that as long as they fight with the Chinese People's Liberation Army, whether it is an army equipped with US equipment or the US army itself, their common fate is destruction. Because justice and a strong will to fight will always belong to us." Finally, Li Dexin said that he would like to propose that the name of this Labor Model Representative Conference be used to send a telegram to all peace-loving people in the world to unite together and jointly oppose the war-mongers. Ding Zhihui, a female model worker of the Fourth Field Army, said: "The U.S. imperialists' behavior of provoking war and destroying peace only increases the resentment of people all over the world. The people want peace, but the U.S. imperialism wants war. Good! We will unite all peace-loving forces to eliminate this war-monger. The two representative meetings held in Beijing this time represent two forces: the national defense army and the production army. If the U.S. imperialism dares to blindly launch a war again, let him taste our strength!" Yang Liandi, a mountain-climbing hero of the Railway Corps, said: "I represent the Railway Corps to express a serious protest against the U.S. imperialists' behavior of provoking war. We shed blood and sweat to build our beautiful motherland, but the U.S. imperialism wants to bomb and destroy it. In the past, the Chinese people lived like cattle and horses under the oppression of the U.S. imperialism for a long time. Now, under the leadership of our Chairman Mao, we have just turned over and started to live a comfortable life, and the US aggressors want to play the old trick of aggression again. We can solemnly warn the U.S. imperialism: It's no use! The Chinese people who have stood up will not be willing to and will not be invaded."

　　全国战斗英雄劳动模范代表
    愤怒抗议美机轰炸安东暴行
    西北军区暨一野英雄代表
    坚信在毛主席英明的领导下，解放的红旗必将插到台湾
    美帝再度疯狂轰炸我领土，杀伤我人民，引起战斗英雄们极大的愤怒。第一野战军特等英雄吕顺保愤怒地说道：“我是个炮兵，我们人民解放军的炮是百发百中的，如果美帝再来，管叫你吃炮弹。我们拥护周外长向联合国提出的对美帝的控诉，但我们还盼望毛主席下命令让我们早日去解放台湾。”驰名军中的爆炸英雄张八警告美帝说道：“来试试我们的力量吧，管叫你觉得不是味儿。”特等英雄刘四虎发表他的书面谈话称：“美帝国内的经济危机像地雷一样总要爆发，再要肆无忌惮地来侵略别人，那是他要想早些死，我们一定成全他早死。”从新疆远道而来的维族英雄拉的诺夫说道：“美帝想吓唬人，谁怕呀？中国各族人民在毛主席英明领导下团结起来，是可以战胜任何一切侵略者的挑拨的。”当大家谈到美帝指使美机进行这种无耻暴行时，不禁横眉怒目，吕顺保、张八、胡青山、马宜生以及西北军区女模范工作者黄得芳同志等都不屑地说道：“解放军同志都知道空军是起不了大作用的，过去我们无数次的经验都说明了这点，美帝帮助蒋介石发动内战结果失败是最好的证明。”最后他们一致表示要更好地提高技术、加紧操练，努力学习文化。他们坚信：有毛主席的英明领导，有我们四万七千五百万人民的紧密团结，我们的力量像钢铁一样，美帝如真的碰上来，就像鸡蛋碰在石头上。他们更坚信，我们的解放红旗插到台湾的日子已不远了。
    西北区劳模代表们表示不许美帝侵略我国寸土
    西北劳动模范代表团的代表们听到我东北边境安东市遭受美机的疯狂轰炸，感到异常愤怒。参加这次全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议主席团的老英雄刘玉厚激愤地说：我们决不允许美帝国主义侵略咱中国的土地，咱中国有四万七千五百万人民，有以苏联为首的朋友们，怎会让美帝来侵略中国呢？美帝如侵略咱中国一寸土地，咱就与它拚命。劳动模范刘建章紧接着说：今天美帝轰炸我东北边境安东市，我们坚决反对它。中国人民团结得越紧，就越不怕美帝国主义。过去几十万胡宗南匪军烧杀我边区同胞，在咱毛主席的领导下，不几天胡匪就给打跑啦！今天我在大会上见到河北省的荣军旗帜张树义，他两条腿都没有了还坚持生产，咱中国人民的力量是很大的，决不怕美帝纸老虎。边区女劳动模范梁秀英挺起了胸膛，提起嗓子说：咱在临到北京前几天还发动了咱村三百多名妇女参加了和平签名，这就是对美帝国主义的抗议。过去，我差一点给胡宗南匪军活活埋死，今天美帝又炸死了咱东北的同胞，还毁坏了许多老百姓的房屋和菜园，我见到敌人就眼红啦！咱妇女的力量是很大的，美帝胆敢惹一惹中国人民，我们全中国妇女就团结起来打倒它。藏民劳模代表不会说汉语，可是在这种激愤的气氛中，他也能体会得到其他的代表们的愤恨美帝国主义的情绪，他表示：要把一切事情都记在心里，回去用藏语告诉给藏区的人民，要他们紧紧地团结在毛泽东的旗帜下，击垮帝国主义，早日解放西藏。
    代表们一致表示：要将美帝侵略我安东市的情况写信告诉家乡，要他们团结起来。加紧生产，支援我大军打垮美帝国主义。
    西北少数民族劳模代表呼吁各族团结打击美帝
    西北少数民族劳模代表发表抗议美帝侵略的书面意见称：
    我国大陆战争已经基本结束，但残暴的美帝国主义还不断轰炸我国领土，杀伤我同胞姐妹，和侵略我国台湾。
    同胞们！各个民族的兄弟姐妹们！让我们在中华人民共和国和中国共产党的领导下，团结得像钢一样硬像铁一样强，如果美帝国主义敢于侵略我们，就请他看看日本帝国主义的下场吧！
    各民族的父兄姐妹们！紧紧牵起手来，让我们千万双铁拳举向天空，让帝国主义者在我们面前发抖罢！我们高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！中国共产党万岁！各民族团结万岁！世界和平万岁！毛泽东主席万岁！

    对于美国帝国主义悍然不顾中国人民的抗议，一次再次以侵略朝鲜的美国军用飞机侵犯我国东北领空，轰炸与扫射我国人民生命财产，破坏我国建设，我们感到无比的愤怒，我们坚决拥护中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长自上月以来历次向联合国秘书长，安理会及第五届联合国大会的控诉与要求，将这一事件列入大会议程并邀请我国代表出席讨论，驱逐非法的蒋匪帮代表，以期迅速公正地解决。我们坚决拥护“美国对朝鲜的侵略军必须立即撤退”的正义要求，我们决不容许美国的侵略武装留在台湾。我们誓以团结全军指战员为争取周外长的要求的实现而努力，不达目的誓不终止。我们具有充分的信心和力量保卫我们祖国国防，保卫亚洲及全世界和平。对安东市这次及前数次因美机轰炸而受伤的兄弟姊妹们，我们特致以亲切的慰问。

    西南劳模代表决努力生产支前
    西南区劳模代表老工人护厂英雄吴坤山发表意见说：“我非常痛恨美帝的暴行，坚决抗议美帝飞机残杀我中国人民。我一定带动我们全厂工人努力生产，支援前线，让我们的人民解放军在毛主席和朱总司令的英明领导下，继续胜利前进，解放台湾、西藏，把蒋介石残余匪帮完全消灭，决不容许美帝国主义再侵入我国，残杀我中国人民。

    射击英雄魏来国说：美帝国主义在八月份侵犯我东北领空时，我当即表示抗议。昨天又看见了美帝国主义飞机侵袭安东市的消息，使我更加愤恨，以我的心情来说，真是要重重地揍他一顿。我坚决拥护周外长的声明。我们在毛主席领导下，一定坚决、彻底、干脆地消灭敢于向中国进攻的侵略者。
    战斗英雄张明说：帝国主义本身就是战争，美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、台湾的一系列行为，都是企图狂妄地挑拨战争，我们要提高警惕与作充分的准备，美帝国主义是软欺硬怕，只要有准备，我们是有把握彻底消灭进犯者的。
    坦克英雄深许说：美帝的侵略行为愈暴露，愈增强了全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒与紧密的团结。我们部队的同志要更加强政治、军事的学习，积极准备解放台湾。
    模范护士李兰丁说：我完全拥护周外长的声明。美帝国主义的飞机曾帮助国民党反动派轰炸中国解放区，使中国人民遭受了深重的灾难，据我亲眼看见过的许多被炸同胞，其惨状不忍目睹。现在美帝飞机又来侵袭我中国领空，我们除坚决抗议外，并要以实际行动来充分准备解放台湾，只要毛主席和朱总司令的命令一下，我们立刻就要行动起来。
    第四野战军的战斗英雄们坚信必能打败美帝国主义
    出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的第四野战军的英雄们，召开了座谈会，会上，英雄们纷纷表示对美帝侵略行为的愤慨和保卫神圣祖国的决心。

    东北军区的英雄代表表示时时刻刻准备消灭侵略者
    二十五日，在全国战斗英雄代表会议揭幕的前几小时，东北军区出席会议的英雄们举行了一个抗议美机侵略我国领空的座谈会。他们对于美帝空军再度侵入我国领空轰炸我安东市区的暴行，一致表示异常的愤恨。四十二军爆炸英雄赫贵顺说：“我们坚决反对美帝国主义这种蛮横的罪恶行为，全世界爱好和平的人们都看得非常清楚，美帝这种新的侵略行为，更明显地暴露了他们破坏世界和平的面目。”张林颖他是东北后勤部运输一团的模范汽车技师，他说：我可以代表人民解放军的战士表示坚决拥护周外长的声明，并且用我们所有的力量支持周外长的抗议。联合国大会必须将美机侵略我国领空的罪行列入大会议程；必须让我国代表出席参加讨论，严惩凶手。战斗英雄杨海水说：我们人民解放军有义务、有力量保卫祖国神圣的国防，毛主席曾告诉我们说，“我们永远是个战斗队”，我们时刻准备着消灭侵犯我国领土的侵略者。四十二军特等功臣姜新良说：在共产党和毛主席、朱总司令领导下我们有丰富的战斗经验和战斗力量。我们不但有力量保卫国防而且在和苏联及各民主国家的团结下，有力量保卫亚洲以及全世界和平。最后，全体英雄们表示：要把这次大会上获得的经验带回去，努力学习，提高现有的军事水平，在巩固国防、保卫世界和平的战线上做一个模范战士。
    东北劳模卢兴文抗议美机轰炸

    海空军、铁道兵团英模代表
    正告美帝国主义：老一套的吓唬手法不行了；战争挑拨者将会尝
        到我们的铁拳。
    出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的海军代表韩进德，对美帝一再侵犯我领空的野蛮行为，表示非常的愤怒。他说：“美机侵犯我东北领空绝对不是偶然事件，而是美帝有计划的侵略行为。同时也正说明了这是美帝在侵略朝鲜失败后临死前夕的疯狂行为，暴露了美帝的纸老虎的吓人勾当。当然，这种疯狂的举动不仅不能吓倒我们；只能使我们更看穿他的狰狞的面目，使全世界的人民更认清他的侵略本质。中国人民是爱好和平的，所以周外长一再愿意把这一事件提到联合国安理会来解决。我们完全拥护并支持周外长这一严正的抗议。但如果美帝还不识好歹，只要毛主席的命令一下，我们海军全体战士一定站到国防的最前线，保卫咱们神圣的领土和主权。”空军代表马德有说：“美帝飞机上次侵入安东时，那时我便非常气愤。现在它又一再来欺侮咱们，我可以预先警告美帝国主义者：年轻的中国人民空军是不可欺侮的，别看我们数量还不多，但是我们有美帝没有的神勇和坚强的斗志。只要上级下命令，我们就决心和他干，决不让他再来侵犯咱们。”参加过渡海作战的海员工人李德心说：“如果美帝再来挑衅，我们工人不但在生产战线支援前线，而且还要直接参加战争。在这次的海南万山的各个战役中，便已经有了不少这样的例子。美帝国主义者别以为他船坚炮利，蒋介石的海军不也就是美式装备的么？可是事实已经一再证明只要和中国人民解放军打起来，不管美式装备的军队也好，美国自己的军队也好，他们的一个共同的命运便是毁灭。因为正义和坚强的斗争意志是永远属于我们的。”最后李德心表示他愿意提议用这次劳模代表会议的名义通电给全世界爱好和平的人民，一致团结起来，共同来反对战争贩子。第四野战军的女模范工作者丁志辉说：“美帝这种挑拨战争，破坏和平的行为，只有增加全世界人民的愤恨。人民要和平，美帝却要战争。好！我们就团结起一切爱好和平的力量，来消灭这个战争贩子。这次在京召开的两个代表会议，代表着两股力量：国防军和生产军。美帝再敢盲目发动战争，就叫他尝一尝我们的力量吧！”铁道兵团登高英雄杨连弟说：“我代表铁道兵团对美帝这种挑拨战争的行为表示严重的抗议。我们流血流汗建设我们美丽的祖国，而美帝却要来轰炸、破坏。过去中国人民长期在美帝压迫之下过着牛马的生活，现在在咱毛主席的领导下，刚翻过身来，开始过着舒心的日子，美侵略者又想来耍老一套的侵略手法。我们可以正告美帝国主义：不行了！已经站起来的中国人民，是不甘，也不会被侵略的。”
