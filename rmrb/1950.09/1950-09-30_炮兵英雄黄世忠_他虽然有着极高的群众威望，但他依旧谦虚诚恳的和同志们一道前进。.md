　　Artillery Hero Huang Shizhong
    He, although enjoying extremely high prestige among the masses, remained humble and sincere, advancing alongside his comrades.
    Zhou Chengshu
    Comrade Huang Shizhong is thirty-one years old this year, from Longshan County, Guangxi Province, attended junior primary school, of poor peasant origin, and was conscripted into the "Central Army" by the Jiang bandits in 1939. After the Japanese surrendered, he studied artillery. In 1946, he was driven onto the battlefield against the people, and was liberated in the Laiwu Campaign in Shandong in 1947. He joined the Communist Party of China in May 1948.

    Four years ago, he and more than 50,000 soldiers followed Li Xianzhou (Deputy Commander of the Second Pacification Zone of the bandit regime) from Guangxi to Shandong. In the Laiwu Campaign, he and more than 50,000 soldiers followed the captured Li Xianzhou to the People's Liberation Army.

    The Laiwu Campaign unfolded very rapidly. Huang Shizhong's artillery had no time to unleash its firepower before he was wounded and fell unconscious. When he woke up, the People's Liberation Army sent him to the infirmary. At this moment, a group of people crowded in, dragging a mountain gun. As soon as he saw it, he couldn't help but shout, "Hey! That's my gun!" This attracted the attention of the People's Liberation Army cadres, who were seizing a large number of new-style guns of various calibers but were suffering from a lack of gunners. Comrade Huang Shizhong was thus escorted to the company and then to the rear hospital.

    The leaders often came to see him, and the comrades often came to comfort him, writing letters or sending things. This kind of treatment, like flesh and blood, was a first in his eleven years of military service. In half a month, it not only healed the wounds on his body, but also healed the wounds in his heart. He was determined to join the People's Liberation Army (Independent Division – formerly Central Plains troops, now a certain army of the Second Field Army). He wanted revenge.

    Returning to the company, his wounds were not yet fully healed, and the historically significant Menglianggu Campaign in Shandong in May 1947 began. Comrade Huang Shizhong served as the second gunner in the artillery company, re-commanding the mountain gun that had fought with him for many years. The platoon leader sent him several challenge letters, and he did not understand what "challenge" letters were. The platoon leader explained to him: this is a friendly competition in completing tasks, to see who fights the best, to see who makes the greatest contribution. He thought for a long time, then accepted the challenge from the first gunner, Comrade Liu Shiqing, and proposed the condition for accepting the challenge: "Guarantee every shot hits." However, at that time, everyone lacked confidence in this damaged gun, which had neither a gunsight nor a scale, and even he himself was not so fully confident. A gun without a sight is like a person without eyes, "Hitting every shot is a difficult thing, but is it really impossible?" he thought, whether he was marching, eating, or sleeping, his mind was always tangled up with this problem. Finally, after two days and two nights of hard thinking, he copied the distance graduations on a gun scale and, without using a quadrant, came up with a method of aiming using crosshairs to replace the gunsight and scale. At this point, he thought, "The people are liberated, the mind is working, and there are more solutions." He immediately ran to the company headquarters to tell the company commander, who said, "Okay! As long as there's a solution."

    When the war began, the enemy was completely compressed onto the mountaintop. All the various caliber guns of the liberation army bombarded Menglianggu into a sea of fire.

    At the artillery position where Comrade Huang Shizhong was located, the division and regimental leaders and the company commander were planning to destroy a high bunker 2,500 meters away to the north, opening the way for the infantry to charge. Comrade Huang Shizhong and his partner, the deputy gunner (who had also been liberated), and a munitions handler had studied everything and divided the work. To be on the safe side, the company commander first ordered the first gun to fire, and then ordered the second gun to fire. Comrade Huang Shizhong fired a shot, which landed in front of the bunker. Comrade Huang Shizhong immediately corrected the deviation of the gun, and the second shot hit the target. He then fired four more shots, and the bunker was completely destroyed. Huang Shizhong's crosshair aiming method was successful, and he was praised by the leaders and all the comrades in the company. After the victory, Comrade Huang Shizhong gloriously earned a major merit.

    In July, the People's Liberation Army entered a full-scale counteroffensive, and the Independent Division, along with other fraternal units, undertook the arduous task of clearing out the remaining enemies in the interior. Comrade Huang Shizhong followed the army from Shandong to Shanxi. At this time, the artillery company was more powerful than before. The second gun team had increased from eight people to eighteen people, with batches of liberated peasants joining the army. Comrade Huang Shizhong's responsibility increased. He not only had to bring the eighteen comrades to Shanxi smoothly, but also had to patiently pass on his skills to the new comrades.

    In March 1948, the Linfen Campaign began. Comrade Huang Shizhong's gun was fired again at Huangtubao on the outskirts of Linfen. After accepting the task of bombarding a large brick bunker at the highest point of this enemy's fire command post, he personally went to the front to inspect the artillery position and reconnoiter the target. He was unfortunately wounded, but he had no intention of leaving the front line. He returned to his gun position.

    "Destroy that bunker with seven shots!" As soon as the regimental commander issued the order, Huang Shizhong's second shell hit the target. The bunker was breached, killing six enemies. Five more shots in succession hit the target, and the infantry captured this outpost. Then, with three shots, a city wall fortification was destroyed. As a result, the enemy's position in Dongguan was completely exposed to our army.

    The Linfen Campaign entered a new stage. The main force had gathered under the city, and the artillery had advanced to only 900 meters from the city wall. Outside the city was an open space. Comrade Huang Shizhong thought: This is the terrain where the artillery position is most easily exposed, which is extremely unfavorable to the artillery. They secretly built fortifications at night and constantly changed positions so that the artillery position could be kept secret. Comrade Huang Shizhong considered these problems day and night in the face of these difficulties. In the past, he only needed to obey orders and fire accurately. Today, he not only had to consider how to destroy the enemy, but also had to consider the possible losses on his own side and create possible conditions to avoid these losses.

    But difficulties were in front of him: it took two or three nights to build an artillery fortification. If it could not be completed that night, it would be discovered and destroyed by the enemy, and only five or sixty shells could be fired before the embrasure would collapse. Comrade Huang Shizhong planned and studied this day and night, fighting stubbornly against the difficulties. Finally, with forty-five people and his budgeted amount of equipment, he built an artillery fortification in one night, and the embrasure could withstand more than 500 shots.

    The general offensive began. The assault section in the southeast corner of the Linfen city wall was the enemy's artillery position, and the high ground in the west corner of the Dongguan city wall was the commanding height that the enemy and we had fought over several times. These two places were connected together, becoming the biggest obstacle to our army's attack on the city and control of the outer moat. On the afternoon of the attack, Huang Shizhong and his aiming hand, Liu Jincheng, and other men gloriously accepted the task of destroying the area with one hundred shells. When the order for the general offensive was issued, Huang Shizhong's mountain gun fired like a string of pearls towards the targets he had precisely calculated. He completed the task with only eighty-five shells. An enemy mountain gun attempted to resist stubbornly but was smashed to pieces by him (this was seen when entering the city the next day, the gun barrel was broken off by more than a foot, the guard plate was knocked off, and the legs were also broken).

    For more than seventy days, due to the coordinated actions of the attacking troops, infantry, artillery, and engineers, the Linfen city, which the enemy boasted was indestructible, was captured.

    In May, Comrade Huang Shizhong gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Huang Shizhong's glorious title of "God Gunner" also spread throughout the army at the same time.

    After the capture of Linfen, the army marched north to central Shanxi. On June 23, our army captured Baisiling. This was the throat of central Shanxi, blocking the army's advance, located 25 miles southeast of Qixian County. It was surrounded by ditches on three sides and mountains on one side, directly controlling the Hongzhong Town below the ridge. The Changyuan River and Baijin Road were the barriers for the Yan bandit regime to control Taigu and Qixian counties. Two steel-reinforced concrete plum blossom bunkers more than two zhang high were built on the mountain, surrounded by bunkers and small bunkers. The Yan bandit regime called it the "Diamond Ridge," which could not be broken.

    Comrade Huang Shizhong and his gunners were determined to conquer the "Diamond Ridge." They worked nervously in the moonlight to transport the big guns into the mountains, repeatedly correcting the gun positions in the position, and were busy all night. At dawn the next day, the command issued an attack order. Artillery fire of various calibers rained down on the "Diamond Ridge" for two hours. Huang Shizhong's gun fired eighty-seven shots, hitting eighty-five of them. He completed the task of destroying the enemy's "Diamond Ridge" B Ridge No. 2 bunker with one hundred shells with only thirty shells. He then used more than forty shells to actively cooperate in destroying B Ridge No. 1 bunker and A Ridge No. 1 bunker. In just six and a half hours of fierce fighting, a battalion of bandit troops was buried with the bricks, tiles, wood, deer villages, and flying dust.

    At the end of the Linfen Campaign, Comrade Huang Shizhong was named a special-class hero of the entire army. In July 1948, he was promoted to artillery platoon leader of a mountain artillery company of a certain division, becoming an outstanding cadre of the people's artillery.

    Subsequently, he participated in the general offensive on Taiyuan and was gloriously wounded for the second time. When he marched to the Great Northwest with his injuries, the superiors gave him an animal to take care of him, but he gave it to the sick and weak comrades in the platoon to ride. When marching to the Great Southwest and breaking through the "Qinling Natural Barrier" boasted by the Hu bandits, Comrade Huang Shizhong not only commanded two guns to open the way for the infantry, but also personally carried the guns to the peaks of mountains thousands of meters high.

    In the past four years, Comrade Huang Shizhong has made many contributions to the Party. His proficiency and research in his profession mark the growth and maturity of his new ideas. However, Comrade Huang Shizhong is not proud of this. Although he enjoys extremely high prestige among the masses, he remains humble and sincere, advancing alongside his comrades. (Attached picture)

　　炮兵英雄黄世忠
    他虽然有着极高的群众威望，但他依旧谦虚诚恳的和同志们一道前进。
    周承术
    黄世忠同志今年三十一岁，广西隆山县人，上过初小，贫农出身，一九三九年被蒋匪抓去当“中央军”，日寇投降后学炮兵，一九四六年被驱上了反人民的战场，一九四七年山东莱芜战役解放。一九四八年五月参加中国共产党。
    四年以前，他和五万多士兵随着李仙洲（匪二绥靖区副司令官）由广西来到山东，莱芜战役他又和五万多士兵随着被俘的李仙洲来到解放军。
    莱芜战役展开得非常神速，黄世忠的炮还来不及展开火力，他已经负伤而昏迷过去。苏醒时，解放军把他送到救护所去，这时前面拥来一群人，而且拖着一门山炮，他一看见就情不自禁的喊了起来：“嘿！这是我那门炮！”引起正缴获大量新式各种口径炮，但苦于缺乏炮手的解放军干部的注意，黄世忠同志就这样被护送到连队，护送到后方医院。
    首长们常来看他，同志们也常来安慰他，给他写信或送东西，这种亲生骨肉一样的看待，在他十一年当兵生活里还是第一遭。半个月来，不仅医治了他身上的创伤，也医治了他心上的创伤。他决心参加解放军（独立师——原中原部队，现二野某军）。他要报仇。
    回到连队，他的伤口还没有全好，富有历史意义的一九四七年五月间的山东孟良崮战役开始了。黄世忠同志在炮兵连任二炮长，重新指挥与他作战多年的那门山炮。排长给他送去好几份挑战书，他还不明白什么是“挑战”书，排长向他解释：这是完成任务中友谊的比赛，看谁打得好，看谁功劳大。他想了好一会，就向一炮长刘士清同志应了战，并且提出应战的条件：“保证炮炮命中。”但是，当时大家对这门打坏了的，既没有炮镜又没有标尺的炮，都缺乏信心，连自己也不是那么充分自信的。炮少了瞄准具就像人少了眼睛，“炮炮命中是一件困难的事情，但是，真的不可能吗？”他想着，不管在行军的时候，不管在吃饭或睡觉的时候，脑子总是同这个问题搅在一起。终于他经过两天两夜的苦思，抄了一炮标尺上的距离分划，不用象限器来对照，结果想出了用十字线射击瞄准法，代替了炮镜和标尺。这一来，他想：“人解放了，脑子也管用了，办法也多了。”他立刻跑到连部告诉连长，连长说：“好吧！有办法就行。”
    战争开始，敌人完全被压缩在山尖上，解放大军所有各式口径炮，把孟良崮轰击得像一片火海。
    在黄世忠同志所在的炮兵阵地上，师里团里首长和连首长正在策划着摧毁北面二千五百公尺远的一座高起的碉堡，开辟步兵冲锋的道路。黄世忠同志和他的伙伴副炮长（在一起解放过来的）和一个弹药手将一切都研究好了，分工好了。为了放心些，连长先叫一炮发射，然后再令二炮发射。黄世忠同志发了一炮，落在碉堡跟前，黄世忠同志立即纠正了炮的偏差，第二炮击中了目标，接着又打了四发，碉堡完全摧毁无遗。黄世忠十字线射击瞄准法成功了，他受到首长和全连同志的表扬。战斗胜利结束以后，黄世忠同志光荣地立了大功。
    七月，解放军进入全面反攻，独立师也和其他兄弟部队一起担负着扫清内线残敌的艰巨任务。黄世忠同志随着大军由山东转战到山西。这时炮兵连力量比前充实了，二炮由八个人激增到十八个人，成批的翻身农民拥进了部队。黄世忠同志的责任加重了，他不仅要把十八个同志顺利地带到山西去，他还要不断的耐心把自己的技术传授给新同志。
    一九四八年三月，临汾战役开始。黄世忠同志这门炮又在临汾外围黄土堡打响了。他接受了轰击这个敌人发射火力制高点最高地方一个大砖碉堡任务后，亲自去前线看炮兵阵地，侦察目标。他不幸负了伤，但他没有下火线的念头。他又回到炮位上。
    “七发击毁那个碉堡！”团长刚发出命令，黄世忠第二发炮弹就击中了目标，碉堡开了口，炸死了六个敌人，连续又命中五发，步兵就攻占了这个前哨阵地，以后又以三发命中摧毁了一个城墙工事。因此，东关敌人阵地完全暴露在我军面前。
    临汾战役进入新阶段，大军已云集城下，炮兵推进已仅离城墙九百米达，城外是一片开阔地。黄世忠同志想：这是炮位最容易暴露，对炮兵极不利的地形。他们黑夜突击修工事，而且要不断的变换位子，炮位才能秘密起来。黄世忠同志就在这种困难面前日夜考虑着问题，如果在从前，只要听候命令，准确发射就行了，而今天，他不仅考虑到如何摧毁敌人，而且也要考虑到自己方面可能遇到的损失，和创造这些避免损失的可能条件。
    但是困难摆在面前：一个炮兵工事的修成需要两三夜功夫，如当夜不能完成，被敌人发觉后定会被破坏，同时也只能发五六十发炮弹，炮眼就会溃塌。黄世忠同志为了这，曾日夜计划着，研究着，同困难作顽强的斗争。终于以四十五个人工和他预算好了的定量器材，一夜就修好了一个炮兵工事，而炮眼能耐发到五百发以上。
    总攻开始。临汾城墙东南角的突击部，是敌人炮兵阵地，东关城墙西角高地，是敌我几次争夺过的火力制高点，而这两个地方又连接在一起，成为我军攻城和控制外壕最大的障碍。攻城那天下午，黄世忠和他的瞄准手刘金成等男士们，光荣接受了以一百发炮弹摧毁该地的任务。当总攻号令发出后，黄世忠的山炮真是弹不虚发，连珠一样的飞向他所精确计算了的轰击目标，仅八十五发炮弹就完成了任务。敌人有一门山炮企图顽抗，被他打得粉骨碎尸（这是第二天进城时看见的，炮筒打断了一尺多，护板被打脱，脚架也打断）。
    七十多天由于攻城部队步、炮、工协同动作，敌人所吹嘘的牢不可破的临汾城被攻克了。
    五月，黄世忠同志光荣地加入了中国共产党。黄世忠的“神炮手”的光荣称号，也在同时传遍了全军。
    临汾攻克后，大军又挥戈北上晋中。六月二十三日，我军攻取白狮岭。这是阻挡大军进军的晋中咽喉，位于祁县城东南二十五里，三面是沟，一面靠山，直接控制着岭下洪重镇。昌源河及白晋路，是阎匪控制太谷、祁县的屏障，山上筑有两个钢骨水泥高约二丈多的梅花大碉堡，四围密布地堡和小碉。——阎匪自称攻打不破的“金刚岭”。
    黄世忠同志和他的炮手们，决心要征服“金刚岭”，他们在月夜里紧张的往山里运大炮，在阵地反复修正着炮位，忙了个通宵。第二天拂晓，指挥部发出了攻击令，各种口径的炮火，连珠般的向着“金刚岭”轰击两小时，黄世忠这门炮发射了八十七发就命中八十五发，以一百发摧毁敌“金刚岭”乙岭二号碉的任务，他仅以三十发就完成了任务，随即又用四十多发主动配合摧毁乙岭一号碉和甲岭一号碉，仅六小时半的激烈战斗，匪军一个营兵力，随着砖瓦木材鹿砦和飞扬的尘土而同归于尽。
    临晋战役结束，黄世忠同志被评为全军特等功臣。一九四八年七月，他升任某师山炮连炮兵排长，成为人民炮兵的优秀干部。
    随后他又参加了总攻太原战斗，并且第二次光荣的负了伤。他带伤进军大西北时，上级为了照顾他，给他一匹牲口，他就让给了排里病号和体弱同志骑。进军大西南，突破胡匪吹嘘的“秦岭天险”时，黄世忠同志不仅指挥两门炮给步兵打开道路，同时他亲自把炮背上了高达数千公尺的山峰。
    四年来，黄世忠同志对党作了很多的贡献，他对业务的精通和钻研，标帜着他的新的思想的成长和成熟，但黄世忠同志并不因此而骄傲，虽然他有着极高的群众威望，但他依旧谦虚诚恳的和同志们一道前进。（附图片）
