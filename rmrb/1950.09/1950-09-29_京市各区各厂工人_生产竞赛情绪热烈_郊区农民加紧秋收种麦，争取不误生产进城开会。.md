　　Workers in Various Districts and Factories in Beijing
    Show Great Enthusiasm for Production Competition
    Suburban Farmers Speed Up Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting, Striving to Attend Meetings in the City Without Delaying Production.
    [Reported by our newspaper] Workers in various districts of Beijing are preparing to welcome National Day with unparalleled work enthusiasm and are launching production competitions one after another. Since the establishment of the Xinhua Printing Factory Beijing Second Factory in April, its production in May, June, July, and August has exceeded the tasks assigned by higher authorities. In September, under the call of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Third District Office to greet National Day with production competitions, many workers in the typesetting and printing departments have shown good performance. Workers from units such as the Yongfeng Chemical Factory, the Metrology Factory, the Housheng Match Factory, the Political Department Printing Factory of the North China Military Region, Hengdecheng, Zhongsheng, Hongda Weaving Factory, Jinghua Rubber Factory, Central Broadcasting Equipment Factory, Beijing Film Studio, Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Film Developing and Printing Factory, Youth Service Department Tool Manufacturing Factory, Guohua Pharmaceutical Factory, Yanjing Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and August 1st Paper Mill in the Fourth District have all carried out various activities to welcome National Day. Some factories have also launched production competitions, which have greatly increased output. For example, Yongfeng Chemical Factory launched a competition on September 7th, and by the 15th, in addition to improving quality, cement production exceeded the quota standard by nine tons, creating a new record of 33 tons in nine days. The sixteen-page lithographic press in the Fifty's Publishing House Printing Factory in the Fifth District originally required two people, but now one person is in charge and still exceeds the machine's production task by 30%. The Construction Bureau's roadside tree nursery trade union (referred to as the Tree Work Team) plans to use white lime to paint all the roadside trees in the city before National Day. The administrative plan requires 290 workdays to complete in eight days, but the workers have guaranteed to complete the task in advance with 270 workdays.
    In addition, on September 11th, Nanzhuangzi in the Twelfth Suburban District held a mass meeting, calling on farmers to actively sign up to participate in the National Day celebrations in the city, and proposed the slogan "Complete ten days' work in nine days," requiring the completion of the autumn harvest and wheat planting before October 1st, so as to ensure that both meetings and production are not delayed. During registration, after mobilization by village cadres, even a 60-year-old Zhang old lady wanted to sign up to participate. When farmers in Wulituo and Sanjiadian villages in the Fifteenth District heard that they could sign up to participate in the National Day celebrations in the city, 300 people immediately signed up. More than 100 to 200 people from Beixinan, Moshikou, Mayu, Pangcun, Gucheng, and Bajiao villages also participated. Wang Lisan, the security team leader of Sanjia Village, said: "You all go! I'll take care of the house and guarantee nothing will happen." Old ladies in their fifties and sixties all said: "Let me go and have a look too! I can also see Chairman Mao and our army. If it weren't for the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Government, we wouldn't have this blessing to broaden our horizons." Because land reform and a good harvest have brought wealth to the farmers, the farmers in various villages have a greater interest in celebrating National Day.

　　京市各区各厂工人
    生产竞赛情绪热烈
    郊区农民加紧秋收种麦，争取不误生产进城开会。
    【本报讯】北京市各区工人，正以无比的工作热情准备迎接国庆，纷纷展开生产竞赛；郊区农民正踊跃报名准备进城参加庆祝国庆。新华印刷厂北京第二厂自四月建厂后，五、六、七、八四个月的生产均超过上级给予的任务。九月份在市总三区办事处以生产竞赛迎接国庆的号召下，排字、印刷各股的不少工友均有良好的成绩表现。第四区永丰化学厂、度量衡工厂、厚生火柴厂、华北军区政治部印刷厂、恒德成、众生、宏大织布厂、京华橡胶厂、中央广播器材厂、北京电影制片厂、妇婴保健院、电影洗印厂、青年服务部工具制造厂、国华制药厂、燕京漂染厂及八一造纸厂等单位工人均已进行了迎接国庆的各项活动。有的厂并已发起了生产竞赛，使产量提高不少。如永丰化学厂于九月七日开展竞赛，到十五日止，除质量提高外，并使洋灰产量超过定额标准数九吨，创造了九天出产三十三吨的新纪录。第五区的五十年代出版社印刷厂的十六页平版机，本来需两个人，现在一个人管还超过该机生产任务百分之三十。建设局路树苗圃工会（简称树工队）准备在国庆前用白灰浆涂刷全市路树，行政计划需工二百九十个，八天完成，而工人则提出保证用二百七十工提前完成任务。
    另外，郊十二区南庄子于九月十一日召开群众大会，号召农民踊跃报名参加进城庆祝国庆，并提出“十天的活九天完”的口号，要求在十月一日前完成秋收种麦，做到开会生产两不误。在报名时经村干部动员后，连六十岁的一个张老太太也要报名参加。十五区五里坨、三家店等村农民当听到可以报名进城参加国庆的消息时，立刻有三百人报名。北辛安、模式口、麻峪、庞村、古城、八角等村也各有一百多人至二百多人参加。三家村的治安组长王立三说：“你们都去吧！我给看家，保管出不了事情。”五、六十岁的老太太都说：“让我也去瞅瞅吧！还可以瞧见毛主席和咱们的军队。要不是人民政府成立一周年，咱们那还有这福份开开眼界。”由于土改和丰收给农民带来了富裕，因而各村农民对庆祝国庆的功头更大了。
