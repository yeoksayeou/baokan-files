Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 9th. The East China Flood Control Headquarters issued instructions on September 6th to its subordinate flood control agencies, summarizing the region's summer flood control work and calling for preparations to prevent autumn floods, in order to strive for a final victory in flood control efforts. The instructions first pointed out that in July and August, under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government and the East China Military and Political Committee, preliminary victories had been achieved in summer flood control work throughout East China. Currently, the floodwaters in the Huai River in northern Anhui have receded, the Grand Canal has safely passed the August flood peak, the New Yi River has overcome five floods, and the Yangtze River and coastal dikes have also weathered the summer flood season.

The instructions said that the next month is the final stage of flood control work for the entire region. There is still a possibility of a resurgence of autumn floods in the Huai River; besides being vigilant against another flood in the Grand Canal, attention should be paid to possible changes in the dike works that have been soaked for too long at high water levels, and timely inspection and repairs should be carried out; the Yi River, Shu River, and New Yi River should all be vigilant against the arrival of new floods; the coastal dikes and Yangtze River levees should be prepared to meet the test of autumn tides and floods, and should be constantly vigilant against typhoon intrusion.

The instructions then pointed out: In order to do the above work well, all localities should strengthen the implementation of flood control discipline. Flood control cadres at all levels must not leave their posts or order the withdrawal of defenses without certain approved procedures. At the same time, all localities should immediately carry out widespread mobilization and education work to prevent autumn floods, preventing any feelings of paralysis and slackness that may arise among cadres and the masses due to the current easing of the water situation and the busy autumn harvest. Flood control organizations at all levels should universally inspect the changes in the dikes and embankments under their jurisdiction during the flood season and after the water recedes, so as to carry out necessary repair works in a timely manner. The instructions finally called on all localities to prepare in advance for post-flood surveys and winter repair plans. The work of handling materials and settling accounts should also begin now, so that it can be handled quickly when the defenses are withdrawn. When withdrawing defenses, flood control agencies at all levels should convene appropriate meetings to summarize flood control experiences and reward meritorious personnel, so as to educate cadres and the masses.

　　华东防汛总部发出指示
    总结夏汛预防秋汛
    【新华社上海九日电】华东防汛总指挥部于九月六日向所属各级防汛机构发出指示，总结该区夏季防汛工作，并号召预防秋汛，以争取防汛工作的最后胜利。指示首先指出，七、八两月，华东各地在中央人民政府及华东军政委员会的统一领导下，夏季防汛工作已取得初步胜利。现在皖北淮河洪水已退，里运河已经安全度过八月份的洪水高峰，新沂河已战胜了五次洪水，长江、海塘也度过了夏汛。
    指示说，今后一个月，正是全区防汛工作的最后阶段。淮河秋汛回涨仍有可能；里运河除应警惕再次的洪水以外，应注意经高水位浸润过久可能发生的堤工变化，及时加以检查和修补；沂河、沭河及新沂河均应警惕新的洪水到来；海塘、长江堤则应准备迎接秋季潮、汛的考验，并随时警觉台风的侵袭。
    指示接着指出：为了作好上项工作，各地应加强贯彻防汛纪律，未经一定批准手续各级防汛干部不得擅自离防或下令撤防，同时各地目前应即普遍进行预防秋汛的动员教育工作，防止因目前水情较缓，秋收正忙的时候，在干部、群众中可能产生的麻痹松懈情绪。各级防汛组织对所属堤防，应普遍检查汛期中与水退以后堤工的变化，以便及时进行必要的修补工程。指示最后号召各地，应提前准备汛期过后的勘察与冬修方案处理。器材，清结账目的工作，目前也应开始进行，以便撤防时能迅速处理。撤防时，各级防汛机构应召开适当的会议，总结防汛经验，奖励有功人员，以教育干部和群众。
