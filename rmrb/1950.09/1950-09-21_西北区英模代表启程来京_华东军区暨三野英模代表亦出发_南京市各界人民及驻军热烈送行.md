　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 20th: The 98 representatives from the Northwest District attending the National Combat Heroes Representatives Conference and the National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representatives Conference departed from Xi'an at 5 PM on the 19th for Beijing. As the representatives set off for the train station, tens of thousands of citizens stood along the streets in the drizzling rain, giving them a warm send-off. At the train station, various organizations and groups in Xi'an jointly held a farewell meeting. Chairman Peng Dehuai also personally went to the station to see them off. On the afternoon of the 18th, the Northwest Military and Political Committee hosted a banquet to entertain the hero model representatives. Chairman Peng Dehuai spoke at the banquet, hoping that the combat heroes would work hard to build the national defense army, consolidate victory, and defend the motherland; and hoping that the worker-peasant-soldier labor models would overcome difficulties and work hard to build a new Northwest.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 20th: The 86 hero model representatives of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army, as well as 11 observers, departed from Nanjing on the morning of the 18th for Beijing. Before their departure, Nanjing held a grand farewell meeting for them. Tang Liang and Zhang Kai, deputy directors of the political department of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army, Ke Qingshi, mayor of Nanjing, Chen Minzhi, representative of various democratic parties in Nanjing, and representatives from the Nanjing garrison and various sectors of Nanjing, expressed their warm respect and congratulations to the hero models in their farewell speeches, and encouraged them to continue their efforts to build a modern national defense army, liberate Taiwan, and defend world peace. Shooting hero Wei Laiguo and female militia hero Liu Hucheng delivered speeches on behalf of all the heroes and models. They all pointed out that the glory of all the hero models should first be attributed to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, as well as the love and support of all the commanders and fighters and the entire people. They expressed their determination to resolutely follow the instructions of the leaders and representatives from all walks of life and strive unremittingly to complete more arduous tasks. At the end of the meeting, Zhuang Xinyi, a model worker in government agencies, read out the telegram from all the hero models to the United Nations Security Council protesting against the US aggression against Taiwan and strafing of the people in Northeast China.

　　After the farewell meeting, the headquarters and political department of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army, as well as the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Nanjing Municipal People's Government, hosted a banquet to bid farewell to the hero model representatives. When the representatives departed, leaders from all departments and representatives from all walks of life accompanied them to the Xiaguan Wharf. Workers and students danced the Yangge dance and played waist drums to see them off. The sound of firecrackers and cheers was endless, and the wharf was filled with joy.

　　When the hero models went to Beijing, they carried various gifts presented by various departments to the conference and a large number of congratulatory letters written by the commanders and fighters.
