Different Languages, Common Will
    A Record of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Delegation's Joint Celebration with Northeast China's Youth
    By our reporter Liang Tian
    The World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation has been visiting Northeast China for five days since entering our country. Representatives from various countries have met with the youth of Northeast China, conveying the sincere words of friendship between the youth of the world and the youth of China. No matter what color their skin is, black or white, red or brown, no matter whether they come from the East or the West, the icy North and South Poles or the hot equator, no matter what language they speak, Russian or French, English or Spanish, they all uttered a common cry: "Youth unite, fight for lasting peace, national independence, and a bright future!"
    The representatives of the world's democratic youth brought brotherly concern, fighting salutations, and cheers for the victory of New China to the Chinese youth! They value every achievement of New China, and they regard China's victory as their own victory, as the victory of the camp of peace and democracy. At the welcoming rally in Qiqihar, the Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Boukalla, said to the youth of Qiqihar: "We have equal hatred for imperialist aggression, and we have the same love for lasting peace, but only the road of unity is the road to lasting peace. Your beloved leader, the organizer of the Chinese revolution’s victory—Mao Zedong, has become the most beloved name of the youth of the free world!"
    The Soviet representatives, outstanding young peace fighters from the socialist motherland, conveyed to the youth of Harbin and Changchun the firm will of millions of Soviet youth to defend peace. More than 110 million peace signatures in the Soviet Union and countless Stakhanovite production competitions for peace told the youth of the world: We have a strong and powerful force, we live in the Stalin era, and the final victory must belong to the peace-loving people, and never to the warmongers!
    The youth representatives from the people's democratic countries conveyed to the youth in various parts of Northeast China their past suffering and today's joy. The representatives from Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Albania, and other countries in Qiqihar, Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, and other places, told the Chinese youth in extremely excited and grateful language that the Soviet Red Army liberated their motherland from the old dynasties and corrupt fascists. Their happy tomorrow is most reliably guaranteed because they are fully engaged in construction and moving towards the victory of socialism.
    The words of the youth representative of the fighting Spanish Republic made the Chinese youth understand the pain of the people under the oppression of the tyrant. The youth of Changchun sang the song of the International Brigade for the Spanish youth's motherland. This song led people to the glorious history of the heroic defense of Madrid in 1935, and to the actions of the Spanish people still fighting against fascism in the factories of Barcelona in the Pyrenees! On the streets of Madrid after fierce battles, in the Jarama Valley full of flowers, not only many outstanding Spanish sons and daughters fell, but also the blood of the most outstanding warriors from the Soviet Union, France, Germany, the United States, and our Chinese, as well as many other countries! The Spanish representative told the youth of Changchun: "We, the Spanish people and youth, have not bowed our heads under the suppression of the savages from Morocco, we are still fighting bravely. The Franco regime, which used to rise by the Nazis and is now raised by American imperialism, has not scared us with its concentration camps and butcher knives. We risked our lives to post peace declarations on the streets, and 300,000 people of the Spanish Republic abroad have signed the Stockholm Declaration. The victory of your Chinese youth strengthens our confidence in the battle!"
    "Ban the use of atomic weapons!" This language of the Stockholm Declaration, which represents the will of hundreds of millions of people in the world, has become the common goal of the youth of various countries and the youth of China. The representative of the World Student Federation said to hundreds of students from the China Medical University in Shenyang who welcomed them: "The second World Student Congress held in Prague this time called on students all over the world to sign the peace declaration and seize atomic weapons from the warmongers. We believe that Chinese students will respond 100%." Yes, not only China Medical University, where all teachers, students and staff have signed, but the vast majority of schools in China have also signed 100%. "Warn the warmongers!" Chinese youth and students shouted this slogan in unison.
    Every representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth solemnly assured the Chinese people and youth that they expressed their unanimous indignation at the shameless atrocities of the US military aircraft invading our country's airspace and killing our people. At every welcome meeting and in every occasion, they extended a hand of friendly support to the Chinese people.
    At the reception in Harbin, the American representative said to the youth of Harbin: "The date of liberation of all Chinese territory is not far away. I have seen the firm will and great strength of the Chinese people. We American youth believe that the conspiracy of American imperialism to prevent you from liberating Taiwan must fail, just as its many previous interventions and aggressions have suffered miserable defeats."
    Different languages, at every mass meeting, shout out the common names: "Stalin!" "Mao Zedong!" Every time these two intimate names, like sunshine, like the ocean, like a father, are mentioned, they will surely bring "Hurrah!" "Long live!" Cheers! These two names, symbolizing victory, like a tendon, tightly unite the hearts of millions of youth all over the world!

　　不同的语言，共同的意志
    记世界青联代表团与东北青年联欢
    本报记者  梁田
    从世界青年联盟代表团进入我国国境在东北已访问了五天，各国代表已先后与我国东北青年见了面，传达了世界各国青年与我国青年之间的衷诚的友情的言语。无论他们是什么颜色的皮肤，黑色的或白色的，红色的或棕色的，无论他们是来自东方或西方，冰雪的南北极或炎热的赤道，无论他们说的那一种语言，俄语或法语，英语或西班牙语，他们都发出一个共同的呼声：“青年团结起来，为持久和平、各民族独立和美好的将来而斗争！”
    世界民主青年代表为中国青年带来兄弟般的关注、战斗的敬礼和对新中国胜利的欢呼！他们重视新中国每一个成就，他们把中国的胜利当作自己的胜利，当作和平民主阵营的胜利。在齐齐哈尔的欢迎大会上，世界民主青年联盟总书记布加拉向齐市青年说：“我们对帝国主义侵略有着相等的憎恨，我们对于持久和平有着相同的爱好，但是只有团结的道路才是走向持久和平的道路。你们的热爱的领袖，中国革命胜利的组织者——毛泽东，成为自由世界青年们最亲爱的名字！”
    苏联代表，来自社会主义祖国的优秀的青年和平战士，向哈尔滨和长春两市的青年传达了苏联千百万青年保卫和平的坚决意志，苏联一亿一千万以上的和平签名和无数的和平工作班斯达哈诺夫式的生产竞赛，告诉了全世界青年：我们有雄厚的强大的力量，我们生活在斯大林时代，最后的胜利必属于爱好和平的人民，而决不属于战争贩子！
    向东北各地青年传达了他们昔日的苦难和今天的喜悦的是人民民主国家的青年代表们，保、匈、罗、波、阿尔巴尼亚等国代表在齐齐哈尔、哈尔滨和长春、沈阳等地，均以极度激动而且感激的语言告诉中国青年，苏联红军从旧皇朝和腐朽的法西斯分子手中解放了他们的祖国，他们的幸福的明天，是有最可靠的保证的，因为他们正在全力从事建设，向社会主义的胜利迈进。
    战斗中的西班牙共和国的青年代表的言语，更能使中国青年体会到暴君压迫下人民的苦痛。长春市的青年为西班牙青年的祖国歌唱国际纵队歌，这歌将人们引向一九三五年英勇的马德里保卫战的光辉历史中，和仍在比利牛斯山中巴塞隆那的工厂里战斗着的西班牙人民抗击法西斯的行为里！经过激战的马德里街道上，开遍鲜花的雅拉玛山谷里，不仅有许多优秀的西班牙儿女倒下了，那里也流过苏联人的、法国人的、德国人的、美国人的、还有我们中国人的以及许许多多国家里最杰出的战士的鲜血！西班牙代表向长春青年说：“我们西班牙的人民和青年并没有在从摩洛哥来的野人的镇压下低头，我们仍在英勇地战斗着。从前靠着纳粹起家现在为美帝国主义所豢养的佛朗哥政权，他的集中营和屠刀没有吓倒我们。我们冒着生命的危险将和平宣言贴在街道上，国外西班牙共和国人民已有三十万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名。你们中国青年的胜利，增强我们战斗的信心！”
    “禁止使用原子武器！”这一斯德哥尔摩宣言上代表世界亿万人民的意志的言语，成为各国青年和中国青年共同斗争的目标。世界学联代表在沈阳对中国医科大学数百个欢迎他们的同学说：“这次在布拉格举行的第二届世界学生代表大会，向全世界学生号召，在和平宣言上签名，从战争贩子手里夺下原子武器来，我们相信中国学生会百分之百的响应的。”是的，不仅中国医大是全体师生员工已经签名，而中国绝大多数的学校均已百分之百的签了名。“警告战争贩子！”中国青年学生异口同声地喊出这一口号。
    每一位世青代表都郑重地向中国人民和青年保证，他们对于美国军用飞机侵犯我国领空杀伤我国人民的无耻暴行表示了一致的愤恨。在每一个欢迎会上，在任何一个场合里，他们都向中国人民伸出友爱的支援的手。
    在哈尔滨的招待晚会上，美国代表向哈市青年说：“中国全部国土解放的日期不远了。我看到了中国人民的坚决的意志和伟大的力量。我们美国青年相信，美帝国主义阻挠你们解放台湾的阴谋一定要失败，正像他过去许多次的干涉和侵略均遭受惨败一样。”
    不同的言语，在每一个群众大会上都喊出共同的名字：“斯大林！”“毛泽东！”这两个像阳光、像海洋、像父亲似的亲切的名字每一提起，便一定会招来“乌拉！”“万岁！”的欢呼！这两个象征着胜利的名字，像一条韧带，紧紧地团结着全世界千千万万个青年的心！
