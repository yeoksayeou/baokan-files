　　A Hero from the Nakdong River Front
    ——A Visit with Jeon Jong-hwan, Representative of the Korean Delegation to the World Federation of Democratic Youth
    By Our Correspondent Tan Wenrui
    While the heroic Korean People's Army has liberated more than 90 percent of the country's territory, driving the American imperialist invading army and the remnants of the Lee Seung-man puppet army to the southeastern corner east of the Nakdong River and south of Mount Bohyeon, and is carrying out fierce attacks, the capital of our People's Republic of China has welcomed Jeon Jong-hwan, a Korean hero from the Nakdong River front who has endured many battles. From this hero, we see the Korean people's fighting will against aggression and their firm confidence in victory.

    Jeon Jong-hwan was originally the company commander of the Second Company of the First Battalion of the 18th Special Guard Regiment of the 4th Guards Division of the Korean People's Army. He left the Nakdong River front on August 25th. Three days before his departure, he was promoted to Chief of Staff of the First Battalion. On September 2nd, the anniversary of the founding of North Korea, he was awarded the "First Class National Flag Order" by the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang for his outstanding military achievements, receiving the highest honor of a Korean combat hero.

    This young warrior, only 24 years old, came from a poor family. His father was a hired hand who worked for others for more than 30 years. The family cultivated one mu of land belonging to others. He relied on his mother's odd jobs and the money he earned from gathering firewood to study for eight years while working part-time. Later, he worked as a newspaper delivery boy in another place and as a rice milling worker. He joined the Korean People's Army in 1948.

    Before the Lee Seung-man puppet army of South Korea attacked the 38th parallel, Jeon Jong-hwan's unit was stationed in an area more than 300 miles north of the 38th parallel. On June 26th, he received orders to counterattack the pseudo-National Defense Force's offensive and quickly launched a counter-offensive, breaking through the 38th parallel and advancing to the Yangju County area. Jeon Jong-hwan's company bravely achieved brilliant results in the first battle of Yangju. He recalled the battle with excitement, saying:

    "Our company was deployed on the left flank of the main force. During the offensive, we encountered a battalion of enemy troops. After a fierce battle, we quickly defeated them all. Then, a regiment of enemy troops came to attack the rear of our main force. Because our company had to complete the task of guarding, we bravely resisted with fewer troops against the many, and as a result, we annihilated more than 280 enemies and captured three 180mm cannons and three rocket launchers. In the Battle of Yangju, our regiment surrounded and annihilated more than one division of enemy troops. Regiment Commander Li Xun was awarded the glorious title of hero in this battle."

    After conquering the various strongholds south of the 38th parallel, the People's Army advanced rapidly towards Seoul, the seat of the puppet government. Jeon Jong-hwan's regiment was tasked with leading the advance, approaching the outskirts of Seoul. Near dusk, they fought the enemy for a high mountain on the outskirts of the city. After the battle, Jeon Jong-hwan's company captured this stronghold, repelled three fierce enemy counterattacks, and further occupied another lower high ground held by the enemy. The enemy had no defenses to rely on and fled in panic. Jeon Jong-hwan's company bravely entered Seoul first, capturing a large amount of supplies and weapons, and made great contributions in the battle to liberate Seoul.

    After clearing the remnants of the enemy in Seoul, they cooperated with tank units to cross the Han River and continue to advance south. In the Battle of the Han River, the soldiers of the People's Army defended and attacked at the same time. Once, Jeon Jong-hwan led his company with ammunition exhausted, yet they continued to resist the enemy's counterattack with stones and iron shovels, killing or wounding more than 200 enemy troops. Their bravery in combat is imaginable. After reaching Pyeongtaek, they encountered fierce enemy artillery fire. The soldiers of the Third Battalion bravely charged forward and captured prisoners. When they saw that they were American soldiers, everyone was extremely angry at American imperialism's participation in the Korean civil war. Their morale was boosted a hundredfold, and they continued to advance rapidly, capturing Cheonan and directly threatening the Geum River, which the American invading army claimed was a "natural barrier."

    The Geum River was deep and the bridge was broken. These People's Army soldiers, eager to cross the river, found only a small boat that could hold five people and crossed the river at night. After landing, groups of five immediately established a bridgehead and engaged the enemy in battle. However, only two companies, one of which was the Second Company commanded by Jeon Jong-hwan, had crossed over the night. At dawn, the reinforced enemy launched a fierce attack on the People's Army that had crossed the river, with the cooperation of airplanes and artillery. The People's Army soldiers with strong fighting spirit persevered for a day. After nightfall, reinforcements continued to cross the river, relieving the crisis, while the American army had fled at the news. So, they passed through Nonsan and went straight to Daejeon.

    In the Battle of Daejeon, their regiment was assigned the following tasks: two battalions participated in the main attack, while the First Battalion under Jeon Jong-hwan detoured south of Daejeon to cut off the enemy's retreat. When the main force completed the task of capturing the city, they also inflicted heavy blows on the retreating enemy troops on the Daejeon-Daegu highway, while blocking the enemy troops coming to reinforce from Okcheon, annihilating one to two hundred enemies and capturing more than one hundred vehicles, fifteen armored vehicles, two tanks, and countless cannons. The escaped remnants of the enemy were also annihilated by another People's Army unit in Yeongdong. In the battle to liberate this major defensive area of the American invading army, the enemy troops defending Daejeon were completely annihilated, and Major General Dean, commander of the US 24th Division, was also killed in this battle. Jeon Jong-hwan's company was awarded the honorary title of "Guards Company" for its outstanding contributions in the Battle of Daejeon.

    The People's Army's fighting will not stop until the entire territory is liberated. After liberating Daejeon, the troops continued to advance southeast. Jeon Jong-hwan's unit crossed Geochang and attacked Hapcheon. The enemy attempted to resist stubbornly and engaged in three days of fierce fighting in the mountains, but was eventually defeated. After liberating Hapcheon, their mission was to cross the Nakdong River.

    The task of crossing the river was difficult. However, the warriors who had the fighting experience of the crossing of the Geum River disregarded the enemy's artillery fire and crossed the river near Miryang, engaging the enemy in two encounters in Samnangjin, capturing many cannons. Then they returned north and approached Changnyeong. On the mountains near Changnyeong, Jeon Jong-hwan's company fought fiercely with the enemy, fighting against a large force with a small one. The mountain they were defending was almost completely swept away by the enemy's fierce artillery fire, but the heroic People's Army soldiers used the magical tactic of "defending during the day and attacking at night" to deal with the enemy, satisfying their hunger with captured canned food and supplementing their equipment with captured guns and ammunition, persisting for thirteen days until the main force arrived. Jeon Jong-hwan left the front line after commanding this victorious battle.

    Jeon Jong-hwan fought from the 38th parallel to the banks of the Nakdong River. In every battle, large or small, in the Han River, Daejeon, and Nakdong River campaigns, he demonstrated the most heroic behavior and established outstanding achievements. He is worthy of the "First Class National Flag Order."

    Jeon Jong-hwan is a member of the Korean Democratic Youth League. He pointed out that the members of the Democratic Youth League have made great contributions in this Korean liberation war. Twenty-eight of the thirty-six combat heroes in Korea who have been awarded the title of "Hero" are members of the Democratic Youth League. Less than two weeks after General Kim Il-sung's broadcast to the Korean people in July, more than 700,000 young people requested to join the army, and this number increased to 849,000 in twenty days. Ninety-two percent of them were members of the Democratic Youth League.

    The members of the Korean Democratic Youth League lead the vast Korean youth in participating in and supporting the country's liberation war. Whether on the front line or in the rear, in factories or in the countryside, they play a leading role. Before the war, the Democratic Youth League in northern Korea had more than 1.3 million members; the organizations in the south had to stop their activities due to the reactionary government's cruel suppression, but as soon as Seoul was liberated, the Democratic Youth League was revived. The youth immediately formed front-line support teams to assist in the Battle of the Han River, fearlessly transporting ammunition and rescuing the wounded amidst the hail of bullets. More than 800 young women in Pyongyang joined volunteer medical teams and went to the front line, while more than 300 worked in hospitals for the wounded. Almost all of the young female students in Daejeon participated in rescue work. Young people in other places organized volunteer armies to go to the front line to fight, numbering no less than 400,000.

    Under the leadership of the Democratic Youth League, the youth in the rear actively participate in various support-the-front activities. More than 20,000 people formed "front-line operation teams" to ensure the completion of the task of stepping up production. The operation team of the West Pyongyang Railway Factory proposed extending labor to twelve hours, completing 150 percent of the production task. Another example is the operation team of Factory No. 65 in Pyongyang. Before the war, participants accounted for only 80 percent of the factory's total workforce and could only complete 78 percent of the production task. After the war, all workers participated in the operation team, engaging in selfless labor, eating, sleeping, and resting next to the machines, and as a result, they overfulfilled the production task by 500 percent. Of particular importance to the liberation war was the youth mining operation team composed of more than 10,000 rural youth, which mined five branch mines and overfulfilled the task by 140 percent. In addition, repair teams were organized everywhere to repair transportation and industrial equipment destroyed by enemy aircraft. For example, a repair team composed of more than 4,200 members in Pyongyang recently completed the dangerous task of excavating thirty time bombs planted by American aircraft in the Pyongyang railway station. In addition, they repaired more than 1,600 meters of destroyed railway trunk lines. At the same time, young people in various places launched a surge of donations for weapons. "Youth," "Young Pioneer," and "Student" aircraft are already fighting the fierce enemy in the airspace of their homeland.

    All the people of Korea are fighting against the American invaders, and the youth of Korea are standing at the forefront of the battle. Countless brave young warriors like Jeon Jong-hwan have already sacrificed themselves for the defense of their country, and more heroes are bravely advancing on the blood of their comrades. They will either eliminate the American invaders on their territory or drive them into the sea. Their fight will not stop until one inch of land remains unliberated. (Attached picture)

　　来自洛东江前线的英雄
    ——世界青联代表团朝鲜代表全宗焕访问记
    本报记者  谭文瑞
    当英勇的朝鲜人民军已解放了百分之九十以上的国土，将美国帝国主义侵略军与李承晚傀儡军残余部队赶到洛东江以东，普贤山以南的东南一隅而进行勇猛攻击的时候，我们中华人民共和国的首都迎接了一位来自洛东江前线久经战斗的朝鲜英雄全宗焕。从这一位英雄的身上，我们看到了朝鲜人民反侵略的战斗意志与对胜利的坚定信心。
    全宗焕本来是朝鲜人民军近卫第四师特别近卫第十八团第一营第二连的连长，八月二十五日才离开洛东江前线的，在启程前三天他已升任第一营的参谋长。九月二日朝鲜国庆日在平壤接受了最高人民会议常任委员会因为他建立超卓战功而授予的“一级国旗勋章”，获得朝鲜战斗英雄的最高荣誉。
    这一位年仅二十四岁的青年战士出身于贫苦的家庭，父亲是一个长工，给人扛了三十多年的活。家里种着人家的一亩田地。他就靠母亲做零活和自己打柴所凑得的几个钱半工半读的受过八年的教育。以后在外地当过报差，也当过辗米工人。一九四八年参加了朝鲜人民军。
    在南朝鲜李承晚傀儡军队向三八线进攻以前，全宗焕所属的部队是驻防在三八线以北三百多英里的地区的。六月二十六日接到命令出动迎击伪国防军的进攻，并迅速转入了反攻，突破了三八线进至杨州县地区。全宗焕的一连在首次参加战斗的杨州一役中就英勇地创造了辉煌的战果。他以兴奋的语调追述当时战斗的经过说：
    “我们一连配备在主力的左翼，在进攻中遭遇敌军的一个营，经过猛烈战斗后，很快就将它全部击溃了。跟着敌军的一个团又开来，企图攻击我主力部队后方。我连因为要完成护卫的任务，以少敌众奋勇阻击，结果歼灭了敌人二百八十多名，缴获一百八十厘米的大炮三门，火箭炮三门。在杨州一役，我们的团把敌人一个多师的兵力包围并予歼灭，团长李勋在这次战斗中获得英雄的光荣称号。”
    攻克了三八线以南的各个据点以后，人民军就向着傀儡政府所在地汉城疾进。全宗焕所属的团担任着先头部队进攻的任务，直迫汉城外围，在天快黑的时候与敌人争取城郊的一个高山，全宗焕的一连经过战斗后夺取了这一据点，击退了敌军三次猛烈反扑，并更进一步占领了敌人据守着另一较低的高地。敌人无险可守，狼狈溃逃，全宗焕的一连英勇地首先进入了汉城，缴获大量辎重与武器，在解放汉城的战役中立了大功。
    在汉城肃清残敌后，即与坦克部队配合渡过汉江继续向南推进。在汉江之战中，人民军的战士们一边防御，一边进攻。有一次全宗焕带领的一连弹药用罄，仍继续以石头与铁锹阻击敌人的反扑，也先后杀伤了敌军二百余名，他们作战的英勇可以想见。到平泽后，遭遇敌方猛烈炮轰，第三营的战士勇猛冲锋，捉到俘虏，一看原来是美国兵，大家对美帝国主义参加朝鲜的内战愤怒已极，士气旺盛百倍，继续向前神速推进，克天安而直迫美侵略军扬言是“天然屏障”的锦江。
    锦江水深桥断，他们这一些急于渡江的人民军战士只找到仅能容五个人的一艘小艇，趁着夜里进行渡江。五个人一组登岸后立即建立桥头堡与敌人展开战斗。但一夜中仅渡过去了两个连，其中的一个就是全宗焕指挥的第二连。天亮以后增援的敌人在飞机大炮配合下向已渡江的人民军猛烈攻击，有坚强斗志的人民军战士艰苦坚持了一天，到入夜后，后援部队继续渡江才解了危，而美军已闻风逃跑了。于是他们就过论山而直趋大田。
    在解放大田的战役中，他们的团是这样分配任务的：两个营参加主力进攻的战斗，全宗焕所属的一营则迂回大田南方，截断大田敌人的退路。当主力部队完成了攻城任务的时候，他们也在大田至大邱公路上予后退的敌军以痛击，同时阻击了从沃川来增援的敌军，歼敌一二百名，缴获了汽车一百多辆，装甲车十五辆，坦克两辆，大炮无数。逃掉的残余敌军亦在永同被另外的人民军部队歼灭了。在解放这一个美国侵略军主要防御地的战役中，防守大田的敌军全部被歼，美军第二十四师师长少将迪安也在这次战斗中被击毙。全宗焕的一个连因在大田战斗建立殊勋而获得了“近卫连”的荣誉称号。
    不把全部国土解放，人民军的战斗是不会停止的。解放了大田的部队继续向东南猛进。全宗焕所属的部队越过居昌而攻击峡川，敌人曾图顽抗，在山地中进行了三天激战，卒将敌军击溃，解放了峡川，以后的任务就是渡洛东江了。
    渡江的任务是艰难的，然而有了强渡锦江战斗经验的勇士们不顾敌人的炮火在密阳附近渡过了江，在三浪津地方与敌人发生两次遭遇战，缴获大炮多门。然后回兵北向进迫昌宁。在昌宁附近的山头上，全宗焕的一连与敌军进行了激烈战斗，以寡敌众与敌军对峙，他们据守的山头几乎一草一木都被敌军猛烈炮火扫荡殆尽，而英勇的人民军战士们却利用“白天防守、夜里出击”的神妙战术与敌军周旋，靠缴获的罐头食物充饥，靠缴获的枪械弹药补充装备，坚持了十三天之久，直到主力部队到来。全宗焕就是指挥这次胜利的战斗后离开前线的。
    全宗焕从三八线打到洛东江边，在参加汉江、大田、洛东江各战役的每一次大小战斗中都表现了最英勇的行为，建立了卓越的战绩，他是荣膺“一级国旗勋章”而无愧的。
    全宗焕是一个朝鲜民主青年同盟的盟员。他指出民主青盟的盟员们在这一次朝鲜的解放战争中有极大的贡献。朝鲜三十六位获得“英雄”称号的战斗英雄有二十八位是民主青年同盟的盟员。金日成将军七月间向朝鲜人民广播后不到两周，就有七十多万的青年要求参军，二十天内增到八十四万九千多人。其中有百分之九十二是民主青年同盟盟员。
    朝鲜的民主青年同盟盟员领导着广大的朝鲜青年参加与支援祖国的解放战争，不论在前方或后方，在部队或工厂，在城市或乡村，他们都起着带头的作用。在战争发生以前朝鲜北部的民主青年同盟共有盟员一百三十余万；南部的组织因为反动政府的残酷镇压不得不停止活动，但是汉城一解放民主青年同盟就复活了，青年们立刻组成了前线支援队，协助汉江的战斗，不畏枪林弹雨，艰苦地担任运输弹药与救伤等工作。平壤八百多名女青年参加了志愿救护队开赴前线，另外三百多名在伤兵医院中工作。大田全部的青年女学生几乎全部参加了救护工作。其他地方的青年并组织义勇军开赴前线作战，数目不下四十余万。
    后方的青年在民主青年同盟领导下积极参加各种支前工作。有两万多人组成了“前线作业班”，保证完成加紧生产的任务。西平壤铁路工厂的作业班提出延长至十二小时劳动，完成生产任务百分之一百五十。又如平壤六十五号工厂的作业班，在战争发生前参加者只占全厂人数百分之八十，只能完成生产任务百分之七十八。战争发生后，全体工人都参加了作业班，进行忘我的劳动，吃饭、睡觉、休息都在机器旁边，结果超额完成了生产任务百分之五百。对解放战争有特殊贡献的是由一万多农村青年组成的开矿青年作业班，开采了五个分矿，超额完成任务百分之一百四十。另外各地还组织有抢修队，抢修敌机破坏的交通与工业设备等。如平壤四千二百多名盟员组成的抢修队最近完成了挖掘平壤车站内三十个美机所投的计时炸弹的危险任务。此外他们修复了一千六百多公尺被破坏的铁路干线。同时各地青年展开了捐献武器运动的热潮，一架一架“青年号”、“少年号”、“学生号”的飞机已在他们祖国的领空中与凶恶的敌人战斗了。
    全朝鲜的人民正在对美国侵略者作战，而朝鲜的青年站在战斗的最前列。无数像全宗焕那样勇敢的青年战士已为保卫祖国捐躯了，而更多的英雄正踏着战友们的鲜血奋勇前进，他们不是把美国侵略者在他们的国土上消灭就是把他们驱逐到海里，有一寸土地未获解放，他们的战斗都不会停止的。（附图片）
