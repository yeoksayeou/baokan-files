　　Xinhua News Agency, 7th. According to a Moscow broadcast on the 5th: The *New York Times*' correspondent in Delhi, Trumbull, reported: As the Korean War daily brings new messages of bombing Korean cities and burning Korean villages, the Indian people's resentment towards the United States is growing daily. The reporter continued: The Indian evaluation of the U.S. actions in Korea is that "foreigners' rule in Asian countries will arouse anger towards them. Some people passionately express that Americans should withdraw from Japan, Korea, Indochina, Taiwan, and anywhere else they are stationed in Asia, and let the Asian people solve their own problems." Trumbull pointed out that because the U.S. and France have formed an alliance to "support Bao Dai's rule in Indochina," the U.S.'s "prestige" has plummeted in the eyes of the Indian people.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The U.S. imperialist armed aggression against our country's territory of Taiwan and its attempt to expand the war in Asia have aroused increasing anxiety and dissatisfaction in Indian public opinion. According to the Indian News Service, New Delhi, 1st, many newspapers have published editorials on this.
　　The *National Herald* of August 27 called the U.S. actions an infringement on the authority of the Security Council. The newspaper pointed out that Taiwan is a part of China, and the People's Republic of China "has every right to take it from Chiang Kai-shek." "As long as the U.S. Seventh Fleet continues to pretend to protect Taiwan, the U.S.'s explanation for its adventure in Taiwan will have no persuasive power."
　　The *Amrita Bazar Patrika* of August 31 wrote: "Truman's so-called U.S. intervention to 'neutralize' Taiwan's actions is completely in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, which cannot stand scrutiny." The newspaper continued: "The smoke screen surrounding the legal status of Taiwan should be cleared." Commenting on the publicly acknowledged reason for rescinding MacArthur's statement on the Taiwan issue (said to be "to avoid confusion"), the newspaper concluded: "General MacArthur spoke the truth about the U.S.'s aims in Taiwan."
　　The *Indian News Chronicle* of August 28, discussing the U.S.'s intention to propose placing Taiwan under United Nations trusteeship in order to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, stated that this proposal would make "Asians, especially Indians, feel 'uneasy'." The newspaper felt that this "strategy, which is too obvious to deceive anyone," is tantamount to saying: "The development of any dispute involving China will automatically accuse Beijing of being the aggressor."
　　The *Statesman* of August 30 pointed out the contradictions in the statements made by U.S. government figures, and commented: "It should be reasonable to expect them to remember the words they have said and written (these words have now been heard all over the world and have reached the ears of many people with different ways of thinking)."

　　印人民对美国愤恨日增
    要求美国人自亚洲各地撤退
    印报斥美帝侵台与扩大战争阴谋
    【新华社七日讯】据莫斯科五日广播：《纽约时报》驻德里记者特拉姆布报道：随着朝鲜战争每日带来轰炸朝鲜城市和烧毁朝鲜乡村的新消息，印度人对美国的愤恨也与日俱增。该记者继称：印度人对美国在朝鲜的行动的估价是：“外国人在亚洲国家的统治，将引起对他们的愤怒。有些人热烈的表示，美国人应该撤离日本、朝鲜、印度支那、台湾以及他们驻在亚洲的任何地方，让亚洲人民自己解决自己的问题”。特拉姆布指出：由于美国和法国结成联盟，“支持保大在印度支那的统治”，美国“威信”在印度人的心目中已经一落千丈。
    【新华社七日讯】美帝国主义武装侵略我国领土台湾，并竭力想在亚洲扩大战争的企图，已引起印度舆论日益增加不安与不满。据印度新闻处新德里一日讯，许多报纸都对此发表社论。
    八月二十七日的国民先驱报把美国的行动称为侵犯安理会威权的行为。该报指出：台湾是中国的一部分，中华人民共和国“完全有权利把它从蒋介石手里夺取过来”。“只要美国第七舰队继续假装保护台湾，美国想要为其在台湾的冒险所作的解释就没有说服人的力量。”
    八月三十一日的阿姆立达巴查巴特立加斯报写道：“杜鲁门所谓美国使台湾‘中立化’的干涉行动完全符合联合国宪章精神的说法，是经不起检查的。”该报继称：“笼罩着台湾的法律地位的烟幕应予肃清”。该报在评论撤消麦克阿瑟对台湾问题所发声明的公开承认的理由（据说是“避免造成混乱”）时作出结论称：“麦克阿瑟将军说出了美国对台湾目的的真相”。
    八月二十八日的印度新闻纪事报在论到美国想提出把台湾交与联合国托管以此来阻止中国人民解放台湾时称：这一提案将使“亚洲人特别是印度人感到‘不安’”。该报觉得这种“明显得不能欺骗任何人的策略”，等于说：牵涉中国在内的任何争端的发展，都会自动地把北京诬为侵略者。”
    八月三十日的政治家报指出美国政府人物发表的声明矛盾百出，并评论称：“期望他们记住他们所说过的话和写过的字（这些话和字现在已为全世界所共闻，并已到达许多思想方式不同的人的耳朵里），这应该是合理的事。”
