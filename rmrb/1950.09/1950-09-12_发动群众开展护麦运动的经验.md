Editor's Note: The autumn harvest is about to enter a tense stage. Doing a good job in the autumn harvest and protecting the fruits of farmers' hard work throughout the year is the central task of current rural work. Recently, incidents of sabotaging the autumn harvest have been discovered in various places. We must not be麻痹鬆懈(má bì sōng xiè; negligent and slack) in any way, so as to prevent farmers from suffering unnecessary losses. The mass wheat protection movement launched in various places this summer has had good results. We should build on the basis of wheat protection work, heighten vigilance, and further strengthen autumn protection work. The following introduces the experience of Yuci Special District, Shanxi Province, in launching a mass wheat protection movement for reference in various places.

I. Leaders Attach Importance and Provide Timely Guidance.

　　Leadership's attention and timely inspection and guidance are the basic experience for the victory of the wheat protection movement in Yuci Special District, Shanxi this summer. Before the summer harvest movement began, each county, according to the instructions of the Yuci Prefectural Committee, first adopted expanded cadre meetings and representative meetings from all walks of life. Some also ran armed and public security cadre training classes to conscientiously carry out summer wheat protection work deployment and ideological mobilization, emphasizing that cadres at all levels must pay great attention to the leadership of this work and study specific work methods. Subsequently, county-level cadres from various organs went deep into districts and villages to specifically conduct inspections and assistance to solve problems. The Prefectural Committee constantly carried out supervision and guidance during the movement, so that everyone from top to bottom paid close attention to this work.

II. Deepen Ideological Mobilization and Launch a Mass Wheat Protection Movement.

　　After the cadres arrived in the villages, they first mobilized the masses through various meetings, with the militia as the backbone, to organize the masses to protect the wheat harvest. However, some party members and cadres and many masses, on the one hand, had麻痹(má bì; negligent) thinking and did not pay much attention to wheat protection. At the same time, they disagreed with relying on everyone to protect the summer harvest. They believed that "too many dragons cannot control the water" and "too many people are useless," especially fearing the trouble of delaying work. Some militia even asked to earn food. For example, some said, "Relying on three families, the pot will fall and the stove will break, the work will be delayed, and the wheat will be lost. It is better to hire people and give them some food. If it is lost, we can still hold them accountable." According to this situation, the cadres went deep into the masses to conduct ideological education. On the other hand, they used specific facts of sabotaging the wheat harvest to educate everyone to be more vigilant, overcome麻痹(má bì; negligent) thinking, and stimulate the masses' enthusiasm for wheat protection. At the same time, they used the method of accounting to widely publicize the waste and irrationality of the old field patrol system, combined with recalling the chaotic phenomenon that still existed in hiring people to watch the fields over the years, to make the masses realize that hiring people to patrol the fields would not only increase their burden but also not play a role. For the militia, they specifically pointed out that defending the masses' production is the central task of the militia after the end of the war. In addition, they also pointed out to the masses: Who was the field watching for in the past? Who is the field watching for today? Now that the peasants have翻了身(fān le shēn; turned over), and the land has become their own, only when the peasants are responsible for everyone and everyone watches the field can the sabotage and theft by saboteurs and thieves be eliminated. After such education and mobilization, the masses' thinking was straightened out, the masses' enthusiasm for wheat protection was stimulated, and they agreed with the method of organizing everyone to protect the summer harvest. The militia's thinking of asking for a price was also overcome. On this basis, the village head, branch secretary, armed forces, public security, production, and other departments organized a wheat protection committee (some called it a disaster prevention and wheat protection headquarters), with cadres and militia as the backbone, and voluntarily combined according to geographical neighbors to form wheat protection groups. They combined with production during the day to watch each other, and at noon and night, they divided the area and assigned shifts to patrol in groups. Village cadres conducted inspections at any time. Everyone in the village was responsible, and a mass wheat protection movement was launched. As a result, a relatively good and stable summer harvest order was achieved, and the chaotic situation in the past wheat harvest in Jinzhong Pingchuan was changed, and theft and sabotage incidents were greatly reduced, which was unprecedented in history. The masses reflected, "This year is well rectified. The summer harvest order has not been better in recent years. The problem that has not changed in a lifetime has changed this year."

III. Formulate Wheat Protection Pacts, Educate and Transform Thieves and Loafers

　　In addition to the masses' initiative to carry out field watching and field protection work, by formulating wheat protection pacts, on the one hand, they organized the orderly picking of wheat. At the same time, they implemented a method of combining mass education and supervision to transform and urge thieves and loafers to participate in labor, restricting and reducing the occurrence of chaotic phenomena. For example, in Wencun, Jiexiu, thieves in the village were educated in advance, explaining that stealing other people's labor fruits is a great shame, and only labor is the right way out. As a result, all six well-known thieves in the village not only did not steal during the summer harvest but also actively engaged in labor. Before the summer harvest in Pingyao, education was widely carried out among the masses regarding theft and the past bad habits of搶麥(qiǎng mài;搶麥 refers to a chaotic situation, sometimes involving搶奪qiǎng duó; looting, grabbing or seizing, where people rush to gather fallen wheat grains immediately after the harvest, often leading to disputes). Then, through the formulation of wheat protection pacts, it was stipulated that "picking wheat can only be carried out after harvesting and transporting is completed, and sheep are only allowed to be released into the fields after picking is completed." An organized and orderly method of picking wheat was implemented, combined with the publicity of production policies, to maintain the summer harvest order.

IV. Villages and Villages, Counties and Counties Sign Pacts and Guarantee Each Other.

　　In order to completely eliminate the occurrence of theft and sabotage phenomena, a system of signing pacts between villages and villages and counties and counties was implemented, stipulating inspection systems, mutual assistance, and mutual guarantees. For example, each village in Jiexiu universally signed pacts with each other, proposing not only to guarantee that the thieves in their village would not steal from their village but also could not steal from other villages, supervising and educating each other, and sending people to the junction to connect and check each other every day. Guojiabao in the Third District of Yuci used to have people steal wheat from neighboring villages every summer harvest, but this year, due to the implementation of signing pacts with nearby villages and guaranteeing each other, theft has not occurred again. In addition, the junction area between the Second District of Yuci and Taigu took the initiative to connect and jointly convened a meeting of village armed forces and public security cadres to study specific methods, assisting and cooperating with each other. Not only did few problems occur during the summer harvest, but it also played a certain role in promoting the close relationship between the people of the two places.

V. Investigate and Deal with Problems in a Timely Manner, Educate the Masses, and Warn Bad People.

　　In addition to paying close attention to the actions of saboteurs and actively preventing the occurrence of sabotage incidents, attention was paid to timely investigation and detection of theft or sabotage incidents that had been discovered. After the case was solved, it was dealt with and handled in a timely manner, and after the handling, it was widely publicized in a timely manner, educating the masses and warning other bad elements at the same time. For example, in the wheat protection movement in Pingyao, after the occurrence of sabotage incidents, three cases were promptly solved and dealt with, and timely notification and publicity were carried out, promoting the smooth progress of the wheat protection movement.

　　发动群众开展护麦运动的经验
    山西榆次地委会
    编者按：秋收即将进入紧张阶段。做好秋收工作，保护农民一年辛勤获得的劳动成果，是当前农村工作的中心任务。最近各地已发现有破坏秋收事件，我们不可有任何麻痹松懈，使农民遭到不应有的损失。今夏各地发动群众性的护麦运动，效果很好。我们应在护麦工作的基础上，提高警惕，进一步加强护秋工作。兹介绍山西省榆次专区开展群众性护麦运动的经验，以供各地参考。
    一、领导重视、指导及时。
    领导上重视，及时的检查指导，是今年夏季山西榆次专区护麦运动取得胜利的基本经验。当夏收运动开始前，各县即根据榆次地委的指示，首先通过了扩大干部会、各界代表会，有的并开办了武装，公安干部训练班，认真的进行了夏季护麦工作布置与思想动员，强调提出各级干部必须十分重视这一工作的领导，并研究了具体工作办法。随后并组织了县级各机关干部深入区村，具体进行检查帮助，解决问题。地委在运动中，不断的进行了督促指导，因而上下一致，对这一工作都抓得很紧。
    二、深入思想发动，开展群众性的护麦运动。
    干部到村后，首先通过各种会议，动员群众，以民兵为骨干，把群众组织起来，保护麦收。但有些党员干部和不少群众，一方面存在有麻痹思想，对护麦不很重视。同时更不同意依靠大家来保护夏收。他们认为“龙多不治水”，“人多不顶事”，特别是怕麻烦误工，甚至民兵还要求赚粮食。如有的说“三家依靠，倒了锅灶，工也误了，麦也丢了，不如雇上人出些粮食倒利洒，丢了还能追究责任”。根据这个情况，干部便深入群众，进行思想教育。另一方面，以破坏麦收的具体事实，教育大家提高警惕，克服麻痹思想，启发群众护麦的积极性；同时用算账办法，广泛宣传旧的巡田制度浪费与不合理，结合回忆历年来雇人看田，混乱现象依然存在的事实，让群众认识雇人巡田既加重自己负担，又不起作用。对民兵特别指出保卫群众生产，就是民兵在战争结束后的中心任务。另外又向群众指出：过去看田是为了谁？今天看田是为谁干？现在农民翻了身，土地成了自己的，只有农民大家负责，人人看田，才能消灭破坏分子和小偷的破坏与偷盗现象。经过这样的教育发动，弄通了群众思想，启发了群众护麦的积极性，同意了大家组织起来保护夏收的办法。民兵要求代价的思想也得到克服。在这个基础上，由村长，支书、武装、公安，生产等部门组织了保麦委员会（有的叫防灾护麦指挥部），以干部民兵为骨干，按地邻分片自愿结合，组成护麦小组，白天结合生产互相看守，午间夜间，划分地区按组分工轮流巡查，村干部随时进行检查。全村人人负责，展开群众性的护麦运动，因而取得了较良好安定的夏收秩序，大部地区改变了过去麦收中的混乱状况，偷盗破坏事件大大减少，为晋中平川历来所未有。群众反映说：“今年整顿好了，几年来没有今年夏收秩序好，一辈子没改变了的问题，今年改变了。”
    三、订立护麦公约，教育与改造小偷懒汉
    除群众性的主动进行看田护场工作外，并通过订立护麦公约，一方面组织有秩序的拾麦。同时对小偷懒汉，实行群众性的教育与监督相结合的方法，改造与督促他们参加劳动，限制与减少混乱现象的发生。如介休温村，事先对本村小偷进行了教育，说明偷窃别人劳动果实是极大的耻辱，只有劳动才是正当出路。结果全村六个有名小偷，不但在夏收中没有偷窃行为，而且很积极的从事劳动。平遥在夏收以前针对偷窃和过去的抢麦恶习，在群众中普遍进行了教育，然后又通过了订立护麦公约，规定了“割完运完再进行拾麦，拾完才准到地里放羊”。实行了有组织有秩序的拾麦办法，结合生产政策的宣传，维护了夏收秩序。
    四、村与村、县与县交界地区订立公约，互相保证。
    为了彻底消灭偷盗与破坏现象的发生，实行了村和村、县与县的交界地订立公约，规定检查制度，互相协助，互作保证。如介休各村都普遍的互相订立了公约，提出不但保证本村小偷不偷本村，而且也不能偷外村，各自监督教育，每天派人到交界地接头连系，互相检查。榆次三区郭家堡，过去每逢夏收就有人到邻村偷麦，但今年由于实行了和附近村订立公约，互作保证，偷盗现象再没有发生。又榆次二区与太谷交界地区，主动进行了连系，共同召开了村武装、公安干部会，研究了具体办法，互相间协助配合，夏收中不但很少发生问题，且对密切两地群众关系也起了一定推动作用。
    五、及时追查与处理问题，教育群众，警告坏人。
    除严密注意破坏分子行动，主动防止破坏事件发生外，对已发现之偷盗或破坏事件，注意了及时追查破案，破案后及时处理法办，处理后及时广泛宣传，教育了群众，同时也警告了其他坏分子。如平遥护麦运动中，发生破坏事件后，及时破获与处理了三件，并进行了及时通报宣传，推动了护麦运动顺利进展。
