Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 14th: After Truman signed the Economic Control Act on September 8th, which had been passed by both houses of Congress on the 1st, he immediately issued a series of executive orders on the 9th to establish agencies to implement controls, giving him control over material allocation and wartime economic mobilization. According to a United Press report, Truman has ordered the Departments of Commerce and Interior, and the Interstate Commerce Commission to undertake material control tasks, all under the unified control of the National Security Resources Board, headed by Symington. These agencies have the power to requisition various materials and equipment at any time for military production. Secretary of Commerce Sawyer immediately ordered the establishment of the "National Production Authority" on the 10th, similar to the "War Production Board" that controlled the national economy during the war, and appointed Harrison, chairman of International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, one of the largest monopolies in the United States, as its director, responsible for the allocation of strategic materials and industrial control. On the same day, the Department of Commerce also ordered the restoration of export controls on almost all steel products from September 30th.

Truman also ordered the establishment of a so-called "Economic Stabilization Agency," whose task is to restrict wages and manipulate prices, in coordination with relevant parties, to plan for the danger of inflation that will inevitably be promoted by expanded military production. Under this agency, a so-called "Price Stabilization Bureau" will also be established. Prior to this, after Truman signed the Control Act on the 8th, the Federal Reserve Board immediately issued an order to strictly limit installment purchases.

The above measures show that the US government is pushing the US economy onto the path of a full wartime system. In a speech on the 9th, Truman also admitted: The Economic Control Act has forced the United States "to use comprehensive controls when comprehensive controls have not yet become completely necessary."

　　加紧准备进行侵略战争
    美国实施战时经济体制
    杜鲁门掌握物资分配及经济动员大权
    【新华社十四日讯】华盛顿消息：杜鲁门于九月八日签署国会两院于一日通过的经济管制法案后，即于九日发布一连串行政命令，建立实施管制的机构，掌握物资分配及战争经济动员的大权。据合众社消息，杜鲁门已令商务部，内政部及州际商务委员会分别担任物资管制的任务，而受以薛明顿为首的全国安全资源委员会统一节制。这些机关有权随时征发各种物资及设备，以充军事生产之用。商务部长沙逸随即于十日下令成立类似于大战时期执掌全国经济大权的“战事生产局”的“全国生产管理局”，并任命美国最大垄断企业之一、国际电话与电报公司的董事长哈里逊为局长，负责战略物资的分配和工业管制。商务部同日并已下令，自九月三十日起，恢复对几乎一切钢铁产品的出口管制。
    杜鲁门还命令成立一个所谓“经济稳定机构”，其任务为限制工资与操纵物价，以协同有关各方策划应付扩大军事生产所必将促进的通货膨胀的危险，在这一机构下并将专设一个所谓“物价稳定局”。在此以前，联邦准备局于八日杜鲁门签署管制法案后，迅即发出命令，严格限制分期付款的购买。
    以上各项措施显示美国政府正在将美国经济推上全面战时体制的道路。杜鲁门在九日演说中也自承：经济管制法案曾使美国“不得不在全面管制尚未成为完全必要之时使用全面管制。”
