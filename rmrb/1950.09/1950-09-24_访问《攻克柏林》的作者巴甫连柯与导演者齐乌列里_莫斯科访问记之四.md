Visiting Pavlenko, Author of "The Fall of Berlin," and Chiaureli, the Director
    ——Moscow Visit Notes, Part Four
    Liu Baiyu

　　Visiting Pavlenko in Moscow was a long-held wish of mine. This wish was ignited by his novel "Happiness," a work that seamlessly blended ideological depth with artistic merit and was the first long-form novel to depict the Soviet Union after the war. Similarly, the color film "The Fall of Berlin," of which I only saw the first part screened at the Beijing Hotel, also captivated me. Pavlenko's "Happiness" received the Stalin First Class Literary Prize in 1948, and his film earned the same honor in 1949. However, upon arriving in Moscow, I was disheartened to learn from Soviet friends that Pavlenko frequently resided in the distant Crimean Peninsula. A few days later, after seeing the complete two-part "The Fall of Berlin" at the Metropole Cinema, I was immediately seized by the miracle of this artistic creation. As one review stated, "This is one of the most astonishing phenomena in Soviet film art." After the film's premiere, the Soviet people lauded it highly, and it recently won a special prize at a film competition held in Czechoslovakia. This film opened a brilliant new chapter for progressive cinema worldwide, artistically summarizing the complex historical reality of the war within a single film and achieving unprecedented success. One evening, during a meeting with Comrade Simonov at the editorial office of "Literary Gazette," I again mentioned my desire. He immediately turned from his chair and made a phone call, then turned back to inform me, "Pavlenko is very willing to meet with you." It turned out he had just arrived from Crimea to participate in the Supreme Soviet representative meeting. This news filled me with immense happiness.

　　One afternoon in late June, Pavlenko arranged for us to meet at a Georgian restaurant.

　　We were half an hour late due to a previous visit. His wife was on the phone in the hallway. He himself was seated at one end of the table, looking through "Ogoniok" magazine. Clearly, they had been waiting for us for a long time. Upon meeting, he apologized and said, "Because I'm staying at the meeting place in the Kremlin, I can only entertain you here."

　　Pavlenko is from Leningrad and is fifty-one years old – born, as he put it, in the previous century. He is not very tall, with a broad forehead and wearing nearsighted glasses. His conversation is profound and wise. He is so affable and approachable. After sitting down, he followed the custom and urged us to drink vodka. But I told him that I saw in "Happiness" his description of Crimean wine as being so fragrant, so I would prefer to drink wine. He did not insist, and in fact, only took a shallow sip of black wine himself. Pavlenko was initially introduced to China as a novelist: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, his "Flames of Vengeance" was published, and recently, "Happiness." But he also made special contributions to Soviet film art. He is one of the Soviet Union's most excellent film scriptwriters. Three of his film scripts have received Stalin Prizes, including "The Vow," which was warmly welcomed in China, as well as "Alexander Nevsky" and "The Fall of Berlin." Therefore, the conversation that evening primarily revolved around film-related issues.

　　Speaking of his film scripts, he thought for a moment and said thoughtfully, "I've written six film scripts, but each time it feels like starting anew, so I don't have much experience. Each time, I think for a long time..."

　　As a novelist and film scriptwriter, Pavlenko compared the two different writing styles, saying, "Film scripts are different from novels. Novels can finely depict very small events, but film scripts cannot do this – think about it, you have a lot of big events to tell the audience in at most two hours. If writing a novel is like painting a detailed brush painting, then a film script is like a poster on the wall, drawn with bold strokes. Like a stage set, painted with a broom.

　　"In novels, you can write very long dialogues, characters can talk to each other at length, but in film, you can't use this method to express things. The audience will feel bored by lengthy conversations. You should use short words to express very important meanings."

　　I think one of the most admirable features of Pavlenko's film scripts is his tremendous power to encapsulate an era. If "The Vow" encapsulated the entire era led by Stalin after Lenin's death, "The Fall of Berlin" encapsulated the complex overall situation of the Soviet Patriotic War, from the first day of the war's outbreak to the Battle of Moscow, the Battle of Stalingrad, and finally the capture of Berlin, with the first victorious Soviet red flag raised above the German Reichstag. There is no trace of formalistic arrangement here, but rather a grasp of the basic content of history at once, prominently expressing rich ideological content. In expressing historical events, he created two protagonists to develop the theme: the steelworker Ivanov and the female teacher Rumyantseva. The lives and struggles of the people are interwoven with the entire history, and the battles determine the common destiny of the people. In their collaboration on these two films, Pavlenko and director Chiaureli created the most explicit paradigm of socialist realism in Soviet film art.

　　Therefore, I talked about the issue of how to oppose naturalistic tendencies.

　　He looked at me, very interested in this question. He said, "Yes, we don't need the description of fragmented, trivial events." He spread his two fingers and pointed to the table: "For example, we are eating now. To specifically describe what kind of dishes there are! What kind of wine there is! It's meaningless. What should be written is why we are gathering here, what kind of people are gathering here. Whether a person shaves upwards or downwards, brushes his teeth to the left or to the right, what does that have to do with us? What we want to write about is what kind of person this is.

　　"When I wrote about Stalin in 'The Vow,' the facts were of course not necessarily like that, it was entirely up to how I wrote it. But there is one thing to pay attention to, it is entirely possible for Stalin to meet with a woman from a collective farm, and it is entirely possible for a woman from a collective farm to go to the Kremlin. Stalin's words are not necessarily said like that, but I can imagine how he might say them. The question is whether this is true, whether he could ask this question, and whether I could answer it in that way."

　　Stalin, the great teacher of mankind, the leader of the Soviet people, not only received an ordinary peasant woman in "The Vow," but also drove a tractor in Red Square. In "The Fall of Berlin," Stalin became the main thread, appearing at the beginning and at various key moments. His appearance enhanced the significance of reality. Especially at the end, when the red flag was planted on the German Reichstag after the capture of Berlin, Stalin suddenly descended from the air into Berlin. How thrilling and ecstatic this was for the broad masses of viewers! This is romantic, but it is very realistic. We can imagine that if we were to depict that great victorious moment in the historical reality of the Soviet people without Stalin, it would be completely unnatural, and therefore unrealistic. Just as new tasks are about to fall upon our heads, and when depicting the era of our Chinese people's great struggle, it would be completely unnatural without the leadership of Chairman Mao. How to understand and portray leaders is a difficult task, but it is a major task of revolutionary realism.

　　Pavlenko spoke about this issue in this way: "Regarding writing about leaders, the main thing is not to write about things related to their personal lives, that is not our business. For example, how they eat breakfast, how they shave, whether they wear yellow leather shoes or black leather shoes, this has nothing to do with us. If you write like that, you are actually blurring the essential characteristics of the leader. But when he walks out of his house and meets the masses, that is our business. How we portray it should take into account how the masses will react."

　　At this moment, the door opened and a slightly plump old man walked in. He had a bald head, smiling eyes, and a red flag badge of a deputy to the Supreme Soviet on his chest. This was the director Chiaureli of "The Vow" and "The Fall of Berlin," whom the host had mentioned he had invited. He is one of the Soviet Union's most excellent directors, and he had personally met with Stalin for his film production work. As soon as he arrived, the atmosphere in the room immediately became lively. He first raised his glass and said:

　　"Let's drink to our best friend - Mao Zedong!"

　　A moment later, he suddenly listened to the singing coming from outside the door. He turned around and said, "I believe you will definitely love to hear this!"

　　This was Azeri female singing, simple and melodious, indeed very similar to our northern Chinese folk songs.

　　Soon, Chiaureli spoke about Chairman Mao's poems. He told us: Very coincidentally, Stalin also wrote poems in his youth, (Pavlenko immediately said: Chiaureli is from Stalin's hometown, a Georgian.) He said: To this day, textbooks in the south of the Soviet Union still print such a poem. He immediately recited it at the table:

　　"The sun fills nature,
　　Flowers cover the fields,
　　Knowledge fills the minds of children,
　　You, with your knowledge,
　　Make the motherland feel happy for you."

　　At that time, I could only hastily record the gist of this poem. But Chiaureli's acting ability was so amazing, his every move attracted us. After reading the poem, he immediately stood up and described the banquet held by the Chinese Embassy at the Metropole Hotel. He said: Stalin never attended banquets at foreign embassies. Pavlenko said: "It is said that Stalin even wore a bow tie that day? That was also the first time!" Chiaureli immediately said: That day, the entrance of the Metropole was crowded with people, all buying tickets to see "The Fall of Berlin," no one noticed that Stalin was led inside as soon as he got out of the car. He said: All the members of the Soviet Presidium were there - he stood up and imitated the posture of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, standing at the door and shaking hands one by one. At that time, he looked and thought that everyone was there - why were they still standing at the door? After five minutes, Stalin suddenly appeared, followed by Molotov, Voroshilov, ah, everyone shouted "Hurrah!" Stalin raised his hands, as if saying, "What are you shouting? Be quiet!" This banquet has been widely circulated among the Soviet people like a folk tale. I have heard it many times, but no one has ever been able to tell it so vividly, with such subtle observations, such characterful and realistic performances, and so full of true feelings and love. I thought: Perhaps this great thought will one day appear in his work.

　　Pavlenko spoke of his own war experience: He participated in the war to defend the Soviet regime after the October Revolution, later fought against the Japanese invaders in the Far East, near Vladivostok. In 1939, he participated in the Soviet-Finnish War as a war correspondent for the Red Army's "Valiant Advance Daily." After the outbreak of the Patriotic War, he went to work on the front lines. Finally, he said: - I also went to Berlin with Chiaureli, but this time it was in the film "The Fall of Berlin." This humorous conclusion made everyone at the table burst into laughter.

　　At this time, I asked Chiaureli how he collaborated with Pavlenko.

　　He said, "After our ideas were unified, we talked and talked every day, and then he wrote it."

　　He paused for a moment and continued, "When writing 'The Fall of Berlin' - no matter what period of history was used, we certainly studied a lot of materials and books, for example, about Hitler, about fascism, about Germany, including German and English translations, more than a hundred kinds. It was the same when creating 'The Vow' - we read the resolutions of past Party Congresses, records of every conversation between Stalin and collective farm farmers,... In short, we thoroughly studied the enemy and ourselves before creating the script. When Pavlenko and I were working, the table was always full of these books and materials. Therefore, the historical accuracy, the handling of reality, and the ideological content of the two films 'The Vow' and 'The Fall of Berlin' were not imaginary.

　　"In the two films, whether Stalin took an oath in Red Square, whether Stalin went to Berlin, many people asked us. I replied: He did not actually go, but there were things close to this fact. For example, although Stalin did not go to Berlin the day after the capture of Berlin, he did go there a month later to attend a meeting, and he did meet with the soldiers before the meeting."

　　I asked him, "What sparked the motivation to create 'The Fall of Berlin'?"

　　He asked me rhetorically, "How could you let go of such an idea - the idea of defeating Hitler and capturing Berlin?"

　　"Such a great fact should be expressed not only in film, but also in sculpture, painting, and drama. Pavlenko and I just expressed it in film."

　　When I met Comrade Bolsakov, Minister of the Soviet Film Ministry, he told me: "Director Chiaureli and author Pavlenko spent two years studying all the relevant war materials in detail and creating the script, and then spent a year making the film. All the war scenes were filmed on location, so the filming work went all the way from Moscow to Berlin. The entire cast of the film was selected from the best actors." This shows the importance the Soviet government attached to this film.

　　Finally, I asked Pavlenko if he recorded materials from life?

　　He said, "The relationship between a writer and life is extremely natural, like breathing." He said that he has been a writer for twenty years, that is, a military officer for twenty years, and he has never left the life of real struggle, and finally he contracted lung disease in the war. Therefore, he is very familiar with war. He cited his 1934 novel "In the East," which was the life he personally experienced in the border guards of Vladivostok. At this time, his wife - a Cossack, whose name is written on the title page of "Happiness", H. K. Trelueva, quietly walked to Pavlenko's side. It turned out that she had received a phone call, and her two young sons had found the phone number of the Georgian restaurant in their mother's books, and they asked to come and see the Chinese friends. Soon, they came, a pair of such smart and beautiful children, sitting aside smiling.

　　It was already twelve o'clock at night, and it was time for us to say goodbye. Pavlenko said that after the Supreme Soviet representative meeting was over, he would return to Crimea. He said, "There are gardens, the sea, and sunshine there..." Of course, from "Happiness" we already know that what he loves is not only the sunshine, but also the labor and creation of the Crimean people. He himself is a direct participant and supporter of these labor and creation, where his creative source is located. For the last glass of wine, Pavlenko said this:

　　"Cheers to our new works!"

　　Good, let us wait for the glory of Soviet literature and art again and again!

　　访问《攻克柏林》的作者巴甫连柯与导演者齐乌列里
    ——莫斯科访问记之四
    刘白羽
    到莫斯科访问巴甫连柯，这是我的一个心愿。引起我这心愿的，是他那思想性与艺术性完整地结合着的，第一部表现战后苏联的长篇小说《幸福》；同时，在北京饭店只看见放映上部的五彩电影《攻克柏林》也同样吸引了我。巴甫连柯的《幸福》得到一九四八年斯大林一等文艺奖，而他的电影则获得了一九四九年斯大林一等文艺奖。但到莫斯科后，苏联朋友告诉我：巴甫连柯经常住在遥远的克里米亚半岛，听了以后我是十分失望了。几天后，我在米特罗波尔电影院看到完整的上下两集《攻克柏林》，我立刻为这种艺术创造上的奇迹所抓住了。正如同一篇评论文章中所说：“这是苏维埃电影艺术最惊人现象之一”。电影演出后，苏联人民给以极高评价，最近又获得在捷克举行的电影评赛会的特等奖。这部片子为全世界进步电影展开了新的辉煌的一页，他把庞杂的战争历史现实，艺术地概括在一部电影片内，得到空前的成功。一个夜晚，我们在《文学报》总编辑室会见西蒙诺夫同志，我又谈到我的希望。他立刻从椅子上转过身去打起电话来，然后转回头告我：“巴甫连柯很愿意和你们会见。”原来他是特地从克里米亚刚刚赶来参加最高苏维埃代表会议的，这个消息使我感到幸福极了。
    六月末一个下午，巴甫连柯约我们在一家格鲁吉亚饭店会面。
    我们因为前面一个访问，迟到了半小时。他的夫人正在走廊上打电话。他自己坐在餮桌一端翻看《火星》杂志，显然他们已经等候我们很久了。一见面，他就抱歉地说：“因为住在克里姆林宫开会的地方，所以只好在这里招待你们。”
    巴甫连柯是列宁格勒人，五十一岁，用他自己的话说，是上一个世纪生的。他个子不很高，广阔的前额下带着近视眼镜。他的谈话是精深而智慧的。他是那样和蔼，令人愿意亲近。坐下来，他按照习惯劝我们喝伏特加酒。可是我告诉他，在《幸福》中看见他描写了克里米亚的葡萄酒都是那样芳香，所以我情愿喝葡萄酒了。这样他也就不勉强我们，实际他自己也只浅浅斟了一些黑葡萄酒。巴甫连柯最初是作为一个小说家被介绍到中国来的：抗日战争时期出版了他的《复仇的火焰》，最近出版了他的《幸福》。但他在苏联电影艺术方面还有着特殊贡献。他是苏联最优秀的电影剧作者。他已有三部电影剧作得到斯大林奖金，在中国受到热烈欢迎的《宣誓》就是其中之一，此外还有《亚历山大·聂夫斯基》以及《攻克柏林》。所以这一晚的谈话，主要是谈电影方面的问题。
    谈到他的电影剧作，他想了想，很深刻地说：“我写了六个电影剧本，但每次都像新开始写一样，所以没什么经验。每次，都想得很久，……”
    作为一个小说家，同时是电影剧作家，巴甫连柯比较起两种不同的写法来，他说：“电影剧本与小说不同，小说可以细腻地描写很小的事件，可是电影剧本就不能这样，——你想，最多两个钟点，你有很多很大的事件要告诉给观众。如果说写小说如同画精细的毛笔画，那么电影剧本就像墙上的招贴画，是用粗线条画的。像舞台上的布景，是用扫把画的。
    “在小说里可以写很长的对话，人物可彼此倾谈，在电影里就不能用这方法来表示，观众对于冗长的谈话是会感到烦闷的。应该以简短的话表示出很重要的意思。”
    我觉得巴甫连柯电影剧作中有一个最令人惊羡的特色，就是他那概括时代的巨大力量。如果说《宣誓》概括了列宁逝世后，斯大林所领导的整个时代，《攻克柏林》就概括了复杂的苏联卫国战争的全局，从战争爆发最初一天，到莫斯科城外战役，到斯大林格勒战役，一直到攻克柏林，在德国国会大厅上升起第一面胜利的苏维埃红旗。这里没有丝毫形式主义的排列痕迹，而是一下子就掌握住了历史的基本内容，凸出地表现了丰富的思想性。他在表现历史事件时，创造了两个主角来发展主题，这就是——炼钢工人伊凡诺夫与女教员鲁明采娃。人民的生活、战斗与整个历史交织起来，战斗决定着人们的共同的命运。巴甫连柯与导演齐乌列里，在这两部影片合作上，创造了苏维埃电影艺术中最明确的社会主义现实主义的典范。
    因此我谈到如何反对自然主义倾向问题。
    他望了望我，他对这问题极感兴趣，他说：“是的，我们不需要零零碎碎的细小事件的描写。”他摊开两只手指着餐桌：“比如现在我们吃饭，专门去描写什么样的菜呀！什么样的酒呀！没意义。应该写的是为什么在这里集会，什么样人在这里集会。写一个人刮胡子是向上刮还是向下刮，刷牙是向左刷还是向右刷，这跟我们有什么关系呢？我们要写的是这个人怎么样。
    “我在《宣誓》里写到斯大林，事实当然不一定是那样，完全在我怎样写。不过有一个问题要注意，斯大林接见一个集体农庄的妇女这完全是可能的，一个集体农庄的妇女到克里姆林宫去这也完全是可以发生的。斯大林的话不一定是这样说的，而我可以设想出可以怎样说，问题在于这是不是真实的，他能不能这样问，而我就这样回答。”
    斯大林，伟大的人类导师，苏联人民的领袖，他在《宣誓》中不但接见了一个普通的农妇，而且还在红场开拖拉机。在《攻克柏林》里，斯大林成为主要线索，他在开头及以后各个关键都出现，他的出现提高了现实的意义，特别是在结尾时，当红旗插上德国国会大厅上攻克柏林后，斯大林突然从空中降落柏林，这是多么惊心动魄，多么为广大观众所狂喜！这是浪漫主义的，但是是非常之现实主义的。我们可以设想，如果表现苏联人民历史现实那伟大胜利的一幕，而没有斯大林，那完全是不自然的，因此那也是不现实的。正如同新的任务即将落在我们的头上，表现我们中国人民伟大斗争的时代，没有毛主席的领导那将完全是不自然的一样。如何理解与表现领袖，这是一项艰难的任务，但是是革命现实主义的重大任务。
    巴甫连柯这样谈这个问题：“关于写领袖，主要是不要去写关于他私人生活的事情，那不是我们的事情。比如怎样吃早饭，怎么刮胡子，穿的是黄皮鞋还是黑皮鞋，这与我们无关系。如果那样写，实际上是模糊了领袖的本质的特征。但是他走出家门，遇到群众，这就是我们的事情了。我们怎样去表现，应该考虑到群众会怎样反映。”
    这时门推开了，一个微胖的老人走进来。他有光秃的头，微笑的眼睛，胸襟上佩着苏联最高苏维埃代表的红旗证章。这就是主人刚才说明过，他邀请的《宣誓》与《攻克柏林》的导演齐乌列里。他是苏联最优秀的导演之一，他为了制片工作，曾经与斯大林亲自会谈过。他一到来，室内的空气立刻变得活跃起来了。他首先高举酒杯说：
    “为了我们最好的朋友——毛泽东干杯！”
    一会儿，他突然倾听着门外传来的歌声，他转过身说：“我相信你们一定爱听！”
    这是亚塞尔拜疆的女歌声，单纯而婉转，确实很像我们中国北方的民歌。
    不久，齐乌列里谈起毛主席的诗。他告诉我们：非常的巧，斯大林在年青时代也写过诗，（巴甫连柯马上说：齐乌列里就是斯大林的同乡，格鲁吉亚人。）他说：到现在在苏联南方的教科书里，还印有这样一首诗。他立刻在餐桌旁朗诵起来：
    “太阳照满了大自然，
    花儿盖满了原野，
    知识充满孩子的头脑，
    你，用你的知识
    使祖国对你感到欣快。”
    当时我只能匆匆记下这首诗的大意。但齐乌列里的表演能力是那样惊人，他的一举一动吸引着我们。读完诗后，他立刻站起来，描叙中国大使馆在米特罗波尔饭店举行的宴会。他说：斯大林从未出席过外国使馆宴会。巴甫连柯说：“据说那天斯大林还打了领结？这也是第一次呢！”齐乌列里马上讲：那天米特罗波尔门口挤满人，都是买票看《攻克柏林》的，谁也没发现，斯大林一下车就被引到里面去了。他说：那天苏维埃主席团的人都到齐了，——他站起来模仿着毛主席、周总理的姿态，站在门口，一一握手。他当时看了看，心里想都到齐了，——怎么他们还站在门口？过了五分钟，突然斯大林出现了，后面是莫洛托夫，伏洛希洛夫，啊哈，一下子都叫起来“乌拉！”斯大林举举手，似乎说：“你们叫什么？轻一点！”关于这次宴会，在苏联人民中已经像民间故事一样广泛流传了。我听了多次，但从来没有谁能像他所讲这样绘声绘色，观察那样细微，表演那样有性格，那样现实，充满真情与爱。我想：这一伟大思想，不知何时也许会出现在他的作品里吧。
    巴甫连柯谈到自己的战争经历：他参加过十月革命后的保卫苏维埃政权的战争，后来在远东，海参威一带打过日本侵入者，一九三九年，以红军的《英勇进军报》随军记者资格参加苏芬战争，卫国战争爆发后他到前线工作。最后，他说：——我还同齐乌列里一起到过柏林，不过这次是在《攻克柏林》影片里。这幽默的结语，使整个餐桌上的人都轰然大笑起来。
    这时，我问齐乌列里是怎样和巴甫连柯合作的。
    他说：“我们的思想统一后，天天交谈、交谈，然后他就写成了。”
    他稍一沉思继续说：“写《攻克柏林》时，——不管采用历史那一时期的事情，我们一定研究很多材料与书籍，比如关于希特勒的，关于法西斯的，德国的，其中包括德文、英文译书，在一百种以上。创作《宣誓》时也是如此，——读了历届党代表大会的决议案，斯大林和集体农庄农民的每一次谈话的纪录，……总之我们好好研究了敌人和自己，再创作剧本。在我和巴甫连柯工作的时候，桌上总是满满的放着这些书籍材料。因此《宣誓》与《攻克柏林》两部电影，在历史的正确性上，对现实的处理与作品的思想内容都不是空想出来的。
    “两部影片中，斯大林在不在红场宣誓，斯大林到没有到柏林，很多人都要向我们问起。我回答：事实上没有到，但与这事实接近的事情却是有的。比如斯大林虽然在攻占柏林的次日未到柏林，但过一个月后，他却到那里去开过会，而且会前也确实同战士们见了面。”
    我问他：“怎样引起创作《攻克柏林》的动机呢？”
    他反问我：“你又怎样能放过这样一种思想——打败了希特勒而攻克柏林这一种思想呢？”
    “这样伟大的事实，不但在电影上，在雕塑，在画、在戏剧各方面都应当表现。我和巴甫连柯不过是在电影上表现出来而已。”
    当我会见苏联电影部部长波尔沙可夫同志时，他告诉我：“导演齐乌列里与作者巴甫连柯花了两年时间详细研究所有有关战争材料，创作剧本，然后以一年时间进行拍制。所有战争场面都是到实地去拍制，因此摄制工作从莫斯科一直到柏林。整个片子的演员都挑选了最好的演员。”这说明苏联政府对于这部影片的重视。
    最后我问巴甫连柯，他是否从生活中纪录材料？
    他说：“作家与生活那是极自然的关系，如同呼吸一样。”他说他自己已是二十年的作家，也就是二十年军官，他没离开过现实斗争生活，而且最后他在战争中患了肺病。因此他非常之熟悉战争。他例举他一九三四年的长篇小说《在东方》，那就是他在海参威边防军中所亲身经历的生活。这时，他夫人——哥萨克人，就是《幸福》扉页上写着的，Ｈ·Ｋ·特烈袅娃，悄悄走到巴甫连柯身边。原来她接到电话，两个小儿子从母亲书本里找到格鲁吉亚饭店的电话号码，他们要求来看一看中国朋友。不久，他们来了，是一双那样聪明而美丽的孩子，坐在一旁微笑着。
    已经夜间十二点钟，我们到了告辞的时间了。巴甫连柯说等最高苏维埃代表会议完毕后，他就要回到克里米亚去，他说：“那里有花园、有海、有阳光，……”当然，从《幸福》中我们已经熟知，他爱的不仅是阳光，而是克里米亚人民的劳动与创造，他自己就是这些劳动与创造的直接参与者、支持者，那里有他的创作的泉源。最后一杯酒，巴甫连柯是这样说的：
    “为了我们的新作品干杯！”
    好，让我们等待着苏维埃文学艺术一次再一次的光辉吧！
