Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: Senior US military officers admit that the Korean War has exposed the weaknesses of the US military. The Associated Press reported from Tokyo on the 28th: "Some senior military officers believe that the Korean War has proven that the US Army needs to make fundamental changes in terms of organization, as well as the recruitment and training of soldiers."

The Associated Press quoted a general of the US occupation forces in Japan, admitting the low morale of the US invading soldiers, saying: "They joined the army because they were attracted by advertisements, which particularly emphasized travel and opportunities to learn business, and emphasized a good and safe life and the possibility of receiving a pension before old age." In order to keep soldiers who joined the army under such tempting propaganda with personal desires in the army, the US military taught them to live extravagant and corrupt lives in between sending them abroad for military missions. This American general continued when describing the situation of the troops sent to the Far East: "They have been indulging in the comfortable life of the East, as one anonymous sergeant said: 'They have never been so comfortable'." Because of this, when they were blindly driven to Korea to engage in the war of aggression and asked to risk their lives, "when they found Korean rocks instead of Japanese carpets, they were greatly shaken." This general's opinion was also agreed upon by another young officer, who believed that "the entire conscription system needs to be revised."

The young officer above also complained about the cumbersome and disorganized nature of the US military structure. He talked about how the US military, which relies on mechanical equipment for everything, is clumsy and inflexible in the terrain of Korea. Often, because of overturned vehicles, "traffic would be stopped for at least an hour or longer. This situation, coupled with the number of vehicles needed to move our extremely heavy equipment, you can see why our command headquarters in the rear had to be forced to start retreating while our front lines were still holding on." However, when the "news of the retreat spread to the soldiers, they would naturally think of retreating as well." Therefore, this officer said: "When you feel that there is a possibility of being ordered to retreat every minute, it is difficult to fight stubbornly." The officer attributed this situation, where those in command in the rear did not believe that those fighting in the front could hold on, and those fighting in the front did not believe that those in command in the rear had the determination to fight, to "lack of flexible action."

According to the Associated Press, Brigadier General Munhol, from the 24th Division of the US Army, also agreed with the views of the young officer above. To show that its report was based on solid evidence, the Associated Press reporter specifically cited Munhol's wife's detailed address in the United States.

The US military, with such weaknesses, suffered "particularly depressing losses in personnel and materials" in the two months of the Korean War, according to the Associated Press reporter.

　　美高级军官自供
    美国军事弱点极多
    士兵战志消沉生活奢靡腐化
    【新华社三十一日讯】美国高级军官承认，朝鲜战争暴露了美国军事上的弱点。美联社二十八日自东京报道称：“某些高级军官认为，朝鲜战事证明了：美国陆军在编制方面以及士兵的征募与训练方面，都需要作根本的改变。”
    该社报道美国驻日本占领军的一位将军，承认美国侵略军士兵的战志消沉称：“他们是因为受到广告招徕的宣传而从军的，这种宣传特别强调旅行和学习经商的机会，并强调生活美好安全以及在不到年老时就可以得到养老金。”为了使在这种诱惑性宣传下抱着个人欲望参加军队的士兵，能够留在部队里，美国的军部在派他们到国外担任军事任务中间，教他们过奢靡腐化的生活。这位美国将军在叙述那些被派到远东的军队的情形时继续说道：“他们一直在耽溺于东方的舒服生活，如像一位匿名的军士所说的：‘他们从来没有这样舒服过’”。正因为如此，当着他们盲目地被驱到朝鲜从事侵略战争、要他们卖命的时候，“当他们发觉了朝鲜的岩石而不是日本的地毯的时候，他们就大大地动摇了”。这位将军的意见也得到了另外一位年青校官的同意，认为“整个征兵制度都需要修改”。
    上面这位年青校官还抱怨美国军队机构的笨重和凌乱。他谈到一切要依靠机械装备的美军在朝鲜的地形中如何笨重不灵。常常，因为翻了车，“交通就至少停顿一小时或更久。这种情况，加上移动我们极重装备的部队所需要的车辆的数目，你就可以看出，为什么在我们的前线还在坚持的时候，我们后面的指挥部就得被迫开始撤退”。但是，当撤退的“消息一传到士兵那里，他们自然也就会想到撤退”。因此，这个军官说：“当你感到每一分钟都有奉命撤退的可能时，是很难进行顽强的战斗的。”在后面指挥的不相信在前面作战的能够坚持，在前面作战的不相信在后面指挥的有作战的决心，这种情形，那位军官将之归因于“行动欠灵活”。
    据美联社称，美军第二十四师一位名叫孟诺尔的准将也同意上面这个青年校官的见解，美联社记者为表明其报道根据确凿，还特地举出孟诺尔的妻子在美国的详细住址。
    具备着这样弱点的美军，在两个月的朝鲜战争中，照美联社记者的说法，其“人员和物资的损失是特别令人沮丧的”。
