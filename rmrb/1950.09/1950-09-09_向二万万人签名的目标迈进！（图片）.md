    Under the auspices of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, more than 6,000 representatives from all walks of life in the capital and representatives from various national people's organizations solemnly held the World Peace Declaration Signature Campaign Conference in Zhongshan Park, Beijing on May 14 this year. This movement immediately unfolded enthusiastically in large, medium and small cities and rural areas across the country. As of now, the number of peace signatures nationwide has reached 100,684,748. Judging from these enthusiastic situations, as long as the Chinese people continue to work hard to expand the peace signature campaign to the vast rural areas, the goal of striving for 200 million peace signatures can definitely be achieved.
