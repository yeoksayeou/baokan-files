Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The French people are angrily protesting the Prévost government's fascist actions of mass arrests of foreign democratic figures residing in France. According to a TASS Paris dispatch: Workers in several towns in the departments of Aude, Pyrénées, Loir-et-Cher, and Garonne held protest strikes on the 7th and elected delegations to lodge strong protests with local governments. In the Pyrénées-Orientales, Ain, Ariège, and many other departments, people held protest meetings. In addition, several members of the National Assembly from the department of Ain sent a telegram to the Ministry of the Interior on behalf of 83,000 voters in the department to protest; the National Association of Former French Guerrillas, the League of French Volunteers of the International Brigades, the Franco-Polish Friendship Association, and other democratic groups also denounced the French government's fascist methods and lodged protests.
    French democratic newspapers unanimously condemned the government's fascist actions. *L'Humanité* pointed out that the government's actions were in response to Franco's demands; Franco made the arrest of Spanish Republican elements exiled in France a condition for joining the North Atlantic Treaty. The newspaper emphasized that this is an insult to the Constitution and the French Republic, and is unanimously opposed by all French democrats.
    *Libération* condemned the French government's police actions as "actions of a typical fascist nature." The newspaper emphasized that the so-called Spanish "suspects" stood on the side of the French people during the occupation and fought heroically against Hitler. *Ce Soir* emphasized that the French government's actions are "illegal" because, even according to official gazettes, it is simply impossible to add any solid accusations to the arrested persons. The French reactionaries' slander that the arrested persons are engaged in "espionage" activities is only to cover up the true purpose of all their actions.

　　普利文政府迫害外侨民主人士
    法国人民愤怒抗议
    民主报一致声讨政府法西斯行动
    【新华社十日讯】法国人民愤怒地抗议普利文政府大批搜捕旅法外侨民主人士的法西斯行动。据塔斯社巴黎消息：奥德、培恩、罗特、加隆各省若干城镇的工人们，曾于七日举行了抗议性罢工，并推选代表团向各地政府提出强烈抗议。在东比利牛斯、瑷茵、阿列日及其他许多省份，人民举行了抗议大会。此外，若干瑷茵省的国民议会议员并特代表该省八万三千选民，致电内政部抗议；前法国游击队员全国协会、国际纵队法籍志愿兵联盟、法波友好协会及其他民主团体，亦痛斥法国政府的法西斯手段，并提出抗议。
    法国民主报纸一致声讨政府的法西斯行动。《人道报》指出：政府这一行动，是应佛朗哥的要求；佛朗哥把逮捕流亡在法国的西班牙共和国分子作为参加北大西洋公约的条件。该报强调指出：这是对宪法和法兰西共和国的侮辱，是一切法国民主人士所一致反对的。
    《解放报》斥责法国政府的警察行动，乃是“典型的法西斯性质的行动”。该报着重指出：所谓西班牙“嫌疑犯”在沦陷期间曾站在法国人民一边，英勇地和希特勒作过战。今晚报强调法国政府的行动是“非法的”，因为甚至从官方公报看来，也实在不可能给被捕者加上什么确凿的罪名。法国反动派之诬赖被捕者从事“间谍”活动，只是为了要掩饰其全部行动的真正目的。
