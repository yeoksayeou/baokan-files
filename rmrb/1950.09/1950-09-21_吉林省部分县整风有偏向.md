[Report from Jilin Daily, Jilin City]: In some counties of Jilin Province, deviations have occurred in the rectification campaign because the purpose, requirements, and focus of the rectification are not yet clear. First, the rectification lacks focus and fails to grasp the main current issues. For example, Panshi County started the rectification in various departments such as the County Government Secretariat, Bank, Tax Bureau, Public Security Bureau, County High School, Agricultural Science Department, County Cooperative, Enterprise Section, Grain Company, and Public Grain Warehouse, and first conducted key experiments in the County Hospital and Department Store. As a result, issues related to guiding policies and principles were not resolved. In Jiutai County, it was stipulated that rectification should be conducted within each section every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; cadres at the section chief level and above should conduct research on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays; and twenty-five leading cadres from the entire county should gather on Saturdays to report and exchange experiences. On Mondays, leading comrades should give lectures to all county government cadres on the rectification situation in various departments, and topics such as agricultural production policies, financial and economic work, supply and marketing work, people's congresses, taxation, unified leadership, leadership style, cadre policies, and public security and judicial matters were placed on an equal footing, with key responsible cadres holding two or three meetings each week to study them. In this way, everything was covered, but there was no central focus, which inevitably led to the rectification work becoming a mere formality. Second, the rectification focused on rectifying subordinates but not superiors, and emphasized checking individuals rather than checking work. In Jiutai, Panshi, Dunhua, and other counties, although many problems were found in the Department Store, Grain Company, Tax Bureau, Court, County Enterprise Section, and County Cooperative by the end of August, these were not linked to the leadership of the county. Instead, county government staff members were writing self-criticism notes every day, which caused cadres to take a passive attitude towards rectification. Some cadres in Panshi County even requested job transfers because of the rectification. Some cadres in Dunhua County felt depressed during the rectification. The county leadership did not conduct thorough research on whether the leadership's rectification methods were correct, but simply used criticism and punishment to solve problems. Third, old problems from the past were brought up without analysis or research, and no solutions were proposed. For example, Jiaohe County, since July 15th, combined cultural studies with work inspections, and the problems discovered were only "the Propaganda Department cannot grasp the ideological situation inside and outside the Party," "the Agricultural Science Department's survey figures are inaccurate," and "the Native Produce Company has a purely task-oriented view," etc. The problems discovered in Jiutai County during the rectification were: "The County Party Committee's work has formalism, with more arrangements than inspections," etc. These are all old problems from the past, and also problems that need to be solved in the inspection of leadership work. However, they only stayed on these problems, without conducting in-depth inspections from all aspects, combining its content with the current main work, and seriously studying how to overcome and correct them, resulting in empty talk.

### 吉林省部分县整风有偏向

　　吉林省部分县整风有偏向
    【本报讯】据吉林市吉林日报消息：吉林省部分县份在整风中因为对整风的目的、要求、重点还不明确，发生下列各种偏向：第一、整风没有重点，抓不住当前的主要问题。如磐石县先从县府秘书室、银行、税务局、公安局、县立中学、农业科、县联社、企业科、粮食公司、公粮仓库等各部门开始整风，并首先在县立医院、百货公司作重点试验，结果没有解决有关领导上的方针政策问题。九台县规定每星期一、三、五在各科内整风，二、四、六科长以上干部研究，星期六全县二十五个领导干部集中汇报交流经验，星期一领导同志集中全县机关干部上大课讲各部门整风情况，并把农业生产政策、财经工作、供销工作、人代会、税收、领导一元化及领导作风、干部政策、公安司法等平列起来，由主要负责干部每星期开两三个会研究。这样，样样俱全，没有中心，势必使整风工作流于形式。第二、整下不整上，着重检查个人不着重检查工作。九台、磐石、敦化等县截至八月底，虽在百货公司、粮食公司、税局、法院、县企业科、县联社中检查出很多问题，但没联系到县的领导，只是县府科员天天写反省笔记，因此造成干部对整风抱消极态度；磐石县有的干部甚至因为整风而要求调动工作；敦化县有些部门的干部在整风中感到苦闷，县领导上不很好研究领导整风方法是否对头，只是单纯的用批评、处分来解决问题。第三、把过去的老问题搬出来，不分析不研究，不提解决问题的办法。如蛟河县从七月十五日学文化结合检查工作，所发现的问题只是“宣传部掌握不住党内外思想情况”、“农业科调查数字不确实”、“土产公司有单纯任务观点”等问题；九台县在整风中发现的问题是：“县委工作有形式主义，布置多，检查少”等等。这些都是过去的老问题，也是在检查领导工作中须要解决的问题，但他们只停留在这些问题上，没从各方面进行深刻的检查，把它的内容与当前的主要工作结合起来，认真研究如何克服和纠正的办法，结果形成空谈。
