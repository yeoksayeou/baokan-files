Chahar News: The Chahar Provincial Trade Union concluded its rectification campaign, which began in mid-July and involved studying rectification documents and the Trade Union Law, and conducting criticism and self-criticism to examine the trade union's work from a leadership perspective.
The rectification summary stated that the Chahar Provincial Trade Union's work had achieved results. First, within the past year, workers in all major industries across the province have been basically organized. Under the education and organization of the trade union, production, conservation, and new record creation campaigns were launched, resulting in a general increase in production efficiency. Rationalization proposals and technical improvements from employees have become widespread in major factories and mines. In private enterprises, labor-management relations have begun to normalize. Since May of this year, labor-management consultation meetings have been established in all major industries, enabling many factories and shops on the verge of collapse to maintain production and overcome difficulties, demonstrating the leading role of the working class. Second, in terms of labor protection, the trade union has advised and supervised administrative improvements in safety and hygiene, reducing accidents and casualties. Regarding the relief of unemployed workers, difficulties faced by over 33,000 unemployed workers have been resolved through methods such as resumption of work, work-for-relief programs, and production for self-sufficiency.
However, the shortcomings of the trade union's work are serious. The most significant shortcomings are an unstable stance and a vague ideology, with a severe presence of bureaucracy that does not care about the hardships of workers. Last year, in handling labor-management relations, the trade union did not stand on the side of the working class, but rather mediated between labor and management, sometimes even suppressing the so-called "leftist" sentiments of certain workers from the capitalist perspective. In May of this year, it again simply called on workers in private enterprises to lower wages to overcome temporary difficulties in the adjustment of industry and commerce. After eight workers died consecutively from illness at the Xuanhua White Paper Factory, the provincial trade union did not immediately send anyone to investigate. Although a joint inspection was carried out with the Health Bureau and the Labor Bureau, the problem was not resolved, and three more deaths followed. Similarly, when the government and the Datong Mining Bureau closed small kilns to protect coalfields, the trade union only mentioned the need to pay attention to unemployment when settling workers, but did not seriously address the issue, resulting in over 4,000 workers having no means of livelihood. It was not until the central government issued instructions and workers' opposition became quite strong that relief efforts were initiated. Some child laborers in the Datong coal mine carried over 700 pounds of coal per day and often vomited blood due to overwork, but the trade union did not seriously try to solve this problem. Furthermore, the trade union failed to thoroughly implement the production-oriented policy. Last year, the leadership of the provincial trade union did not have a clear understanding of this, and only generally called on lower-level trade unions without specific guidance. This spring, after the instructions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the inspiration of advanced experiences from the Northeast, trade union cadres began to focus on production and go deep into factories and mines, advancing the production movement in state-owned enterprises. However, the trade union's production-oriented policy has still not been implemented in all grassroots trade union organizations, and many grassroots trade union organizations still neglect leading production. In the production movement, they do not pay attention to product quality and casually waste and consume raw materials, machinery, and workers' physical strength. Last year, in order to welcome "May Day," the Yantongshan Iron Mine voluntarily proposed to work one hour of overtime. The trade union did not consider the workers' health and actually "mobilized" the workers to persist in this for a long time until Taiwan was taken, causing worker dissatisfaction. Again, the leadership of general work involves more deployment and less inspection, more requests for materials, and untimely or even non-existent responses to questions. Due to a lack of scientific and organized leadership, serious clericalism has formed. Work plans are not specific and do not suit the overall situation. They are not good at leveraging the strength of collective organizations. The Standing Committee leadership has not been formally established for a long time, and many things are not done according to regulations. Many members have not paid their membership dues for a long time, and neither profound education nor processing has been carried out. Membership dues revenue and expenditure are not announced to members. They have not seriously studied the instructions of higher authorities, and many things only serve as a megaphone. They are not good at summarizing experience, and many reports are a list of phenomena and figures that cannot explain the problem.
After inspection, preliminary measures to overcome the above shortcomings have been formulated: (1) Improve the leadership of the Party group and the Standing Committee, and establish various formal work systems. (2) Supplement cadres and improve the work of various departments. (3) Go deep into the lower levels in a planned way to conduct investigations and research. Provide specific guidance and assistance to grassroots trade union organizations in production competitions, solve workers' demands, and summarize and promote advanced experiences from practical work. (4) Strengthen theoretical and professional study, carry out criticism and self-criticism, overcome the bureaucratic work style that does not care about the masses, stand firmly on the working class's position, and work actively.

### 察省总工会整风告一段落  立场不稳和官僚主义作风是主要缺点

　　察省总工会整风告一段落
    立场不稳和官僚主义作风是主要缺点
    【本报察哈尔讯】通讯员唐桓报道：察哈尔省总工会自七月中旬开始整风，学习整风文件及工会法，开展批评与自我批评，从领导上检查了工会工作，现已告一段落。
    在整风总结中，说明察省工会工作是有成绩的。首先表现在：一年多以来，全省各主要产业工人基本上已组织起来，在工会的教育和组织下，曾展开了生产节约和创造新纪录运动，生产效率普遍提高；职工的合理化建议，技术改进，在各主要厂矿已带有普遍性。在私营企业里，劳资关系已开始走向正常，由今年五月到现在，各主要行业都建立了劳资协商会议，使许多即将倒闭的厂店得以维持生产，度过困难，显示了工人阶级的领导作用。其次，在劳动保护工作上，工会曾建议及监督行政改进了安全卫生工作，减少了事故与伤亡。对失业工人的救济，经过复工就业、以工代赈、生产自救等办法，解决了三万三千余失业工人的困难。
    但工会工作的缺点是严重的，最主要的缺点是立场不稳、观念模糊，严重的存在着不关心工人疾苦的官僚主义。去年在处理劳资关系上，工会不是站在工人阶级的立场，而是站在劳资之间进行调解，有时甚至站在资本家方面来压制某些工人的所谓“左”的情绪；今年五月，则又单纯的号召私营企业工人降低工资，来克服调整工商业中的暂时困难。宣化白皮厂工人连续病死八名，省总工会知道后并没有立即派人去检查；后虽协同卫生局与劳动局作了检查，问题并未解决，接着又死亡三名。又如政府与大同矿务局为保护煤田，封闭小窑，工会对安置工人，只是提出要注意失业问题，但并未认真处理，致造成四千余工人生活无着。直到中央指示和工人反对情绪相当严重时，才进行救济。大同煤矿童工有的每天背炭七百多斤，常有因劳累过度而吐血，工会亦未认真设法解决。其次，工会对面向生产的方针未能深入贯彻。去年，省总工会的领导上对此认识不明确，对下级工会只是一般地号召，没有具体领导；今春，经过全总的指示及东北先进经验的启发，工会干部开始抓住生产，深入厂矿，使公营企业的生产运动前进了一步。但工会面向生产的方针，仍未能贯彻到各基层工会，有许多基层工会组织仍忽视领导生产。在生产运动中，不注意产品质量，对原料、机器、工人体力随便浪费消耗。烟筒山铁矿去年为迎接“五一”，自动提出加班一小时，工会不考虑工人身体健康，竟“动员”工人长期坚持下去，到打下台湾为止，引起工人不满。再次，对一般工作的领导，则是布置多，检查少，材料要的多，问题答复不及时，甚至有的不答复。由于缺乏科学的有组织的领导，形成严重的事务主义。工作计划不具体，不适合全面情况；不善于发挥集体组织力量，常委会领导长期未正式形成，许多事情不按规章办事；许多会员长期不交会费，既不进行深刻教育，也不进行处理。会费收支不向会员公布。对上级的指示未认真研究，许多事情只起了个传声筒的作用；不善于总结经验，许多报告是现象与数字罗列，不能说明问题。
    经检查后，针对以上缺点已初步订出克服办法：（一）健全党组与常委会的领导，树立各种正轨工作制度。（二）充实干部，健全各部门的工作。（三）有计划地深入下层，进行调查研究。具体指导与协助基层工会组织生产竞赛，解决职工要求，从实际工作中来总结和推广先进经验。（四）加强理论和业务学习，开展批评与自我批评，克服不关心群众的官僚主义作风，站稳工人阶级立场，积极工作。
