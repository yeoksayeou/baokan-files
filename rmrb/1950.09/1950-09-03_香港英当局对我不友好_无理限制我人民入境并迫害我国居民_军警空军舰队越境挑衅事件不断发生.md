Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 1st: For the past four months, the British authorities in Hong Kong have implemented increasingly unreasonable measures to restrict the entry of Chinese people and persecute Chinese residents. British military police, air force, and fleet have constantly provoked across the border, infringing upon our national sovereignty. Since May 1st, when the British government in Hong Kong officially implemented unreasonable measures restricting the entry of Chinese people, they have dispatched police to set up stations at places such as Man Kam To and Lo Wu Station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to inspect travelers going to Hong Kong. They have also built new gun emplacements and barbed wire fences next to the Lo Wu Bridge, using searchlights to illuminate our side at night and deploying tanks for patrols. Travelers to Hong Kong must queue on the Lo Wu Bridge and be subjected to body searches and interrogations by British police. Those deemed not to have the correct "procedures" are not allowed to enter. Travelers must wait five or six hours in exhaustion, enduring sun, rain, and the barbaric treatment of British police. On July 6th, at the bridgehead of Man Kam To, a serious incident occurred where British police continuously opened fire to prevent travelers from entering, injuring three Chinese people, Yang Liugen, Chen Xia, and Su Li, and arresting two travelers. Prior to this incident, on May 27th, Xie Shichang, a teacher at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, attempted to enter Hong Kong via Lo Wu and was threatened by British police with machine guns. Xie turned back immediately, but British police crossed the border and arrested Xie, beating him unconscious four times. He was detained for ten hours before being released. As for incidents of Chinese people being unreasonably beaten and losing property, they happen regularly. In the first half of June alone, according to incomplete statistics, there were more than ten instances of our travelers being severely beaten by British police and their luggage being thrown into the river. On July 23rd, worker Chen Achang was kicked and punched by British police while crossing the Lo Wu Bridge into Hong Kong, injuring his chest and abdomen, and he fainted on the ground.

Following the banning of more than thirty Chinese people's organizations in Hong Kong, the British government has further persecuted Chinese people and progressive organizations in Hong Kong. In June, the British authorities, citing fire safety issues, revoked the registration of Han Wah Middle School. After the school argued its case, it was allowed to register and resume classes. In early July, Mai Yaoquan, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, and Mai Hezhi, chairman of the Kowloon Dockworkers' Union, were suddenly and unreasonably deported by the British government in Hong Kong. In the past six months or so, a total of twenty-one Chinese people, including Lu Dong, the principal of Heung To Middle School, workers, staff, and intellectuals, have been deported. The incident on June 18th, in which union workers on a suburban outing were brutally attacked by Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "disbanded soldiers," resulting in twenty-six workers being injured and their belongings looted, has threatened the safety of life and property of Chinese people in Hong Kong. This group of remnants is sheltered and favored by the British government. After the incident, the British authorities did not punish the perpetrators, nor did they order them to compensate for the losses.

Incidents of British warships, aircraft, and British military police intruding into our territorial waters, airspace, and territory occur frequently. Recent incidents include: On August 17th, a British warship intruded into our territorial waters via Outer Lingding Island and fired more than twenty shells at our People's Liberation Army; from August 2nd to 6th, British aircraft, continuously dispatching two to four planes, intruded into our airspace over Garbage Island, Wanshan Islands, and other places for reconnaissance; on July 27th, five fully armed British soldiers, carrying weapons, machine guns, compasses, and military maps, penetrated two *hua li* (approx. 1 km) deep into our border. In addition, according to incomplete statistics: from early June to early August, British aircraft crossed into our airspace, conducting low-altitude circling and reconnaissance, more than fifty times, totaling more than one hundred aircraft. On July 4th alone, a British reconnaissance plane and a fighter plane flew over the Man Kam To border, circling five times over our station, disturbing our travelers. At the same time, eleven British aircraft in seven batches crossed the border at Huangbeiling. From the end of May to the end of July, there were four incidents of British troops and police crossing the border. Among them, at 3:30 pm on July 16th, two policemen from the British Lok Ma Chau Police Station opened fire at our哨位 (sentry post) at Futian Ferry and continued to observe for half an hour before leaving.

　　香港英当局对我不友好
    无理限制我人民入境并迫害我国居民
    军警空军舰队越境挑衅事件不断发生
    【新华社广州一日电】四个月来，香港英国当局无理限制中国人民入境，迫害中国居民的无理措施，层出不穷，且变本加厉；英国军警、空军、舰队越境挑衅，侵犯我国主权的行为更不断发生。自五月一日香港英国政府正式实施限制中国人民入境的无理措施后，即在文锦渡和广九路罗湖站等处派警设站，检查去港旅客，并在罗湖桥旁新筑炮台、铁丝网，夜晚时以探照灯向我方照射，并出动坦克来往巡逻。赴港旅客入境必须在罗湖桥排队，挨次受英国警察的搜身和盘问。如被认为不合“手续”时，就不许入境。旅客于困倦中必须守候五六小时，备受日晒雨淋和英国警察的野蛮待遇。七月六日在文锦渡桥头，竟发生英国警察为阻止旅客入境，连续开枪，击伤中国人民杨柳根、陈霞、苏梨等三人，并捕去旅客二人的严重事件。在此事件之前，五月二十七日，广州中山大学教员谢诗昌拟经罗湖入港，遭英国警察机枪威吓，谢即转身回来，英国警察竟越界将谢捕去，并四次将谢毒打至晕厥，拘禁十小时后始行释放。至于中国人民被无理殴击和丧失财物的事件，更是经常发生。仅六月上半月不完全统计，我旅客遭英国警察痛殴，行李被抛到河里的即有十余次。七月二十三日工人陈阿昌经罗湖桥入港，为英国警察拳打脚踢，胸部腹部均受伤，晕倒在地。
    继香港三十余中国人民团体被禁止活动之后，英国政府更进一步迫害在港中国人民和进步团体。六月间英国当局借口防火设备问题，取消汉华中学注册，后该校据理力争，始获准注册开课。七月初旬港九工会联合会副理事长麦耀全和九龙船坞劳工联合会主席麦河志竟突然遭受香港英国政府无理递解出境。半年多以来被递解出境的中国人民即有香岛中学校长卢动等工人、职员、知识分子共二十一人。六月十八日发生的旅行郊外的工会工人被蒋匪的所谓“流散军人”凶殴、二十六名工人被打伤、衣物被掠夺事件，使香港中国人民的生命财产安全受到威胁。这批残匪是由英国政府收容和优待的，事件发生以后英国当局并未惩办凶手，亦未令其赔偿损失。
    香港英方的军舰、飞机和英国军警侵入我国领海、领空、领土的事件经常发生。最近发生的有：八月十七日英舰一艘经外伶仃岛侵入我领海，竟向我人民解放军发炮二十余发；八月二日至六日英机连续出动二架至四架，侵入我垃圾岛、万山群岛等地领空侦察；七月二十七日全副武装的英军五名，携带武器、机枪、指南针、军用地图，深入我边界二华里。此外，据不完全统计：自六月初至八月初，英国飞机越入我领空，进行低飞盘旋、侦察者，共五十余次，总计飞机一百余架。其中仅七月四日即有英国侦察机、战斗机各一架飞越文锦渡边界，在我国车站上空盘旋五次，惊扰我旅客。同时，又有英机十一架分七批在黄贝岭越界。五月底至七月底，即发生四次英军、警越界事件。其中七月十六日下午三时半英国勒马洲警察署警察二人在福田渡向我哨位开枪，并继续了望半小时始离去。
