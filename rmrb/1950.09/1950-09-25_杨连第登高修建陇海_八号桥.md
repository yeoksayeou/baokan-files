Yang Lian'di Ascends to Build the Longhai Railway's "Eighth Bridge"
　　Supporting the Liberation of the Great Northwest Requires First Repairing the Eighth Bridge
　　On the Longhai Railway’s Luo (Yang) Tong (Guan) section, amidst the towering mountains west of Guanyintang, stands a nationally renowned high bridge – the Eighth Bridge. The bridge, forty-five meters high, is suspended between two mountains. The mountain terrain is precipitous, and the topography is treacherous, making it the most dangerous engineering project on the Longhai line. This bridge was designed jointly by French and Belgian engineers in 1922 and took four years to build. In 1944, when the Japanese invaders invaded the Central Plains, the Kuomintang army thoroughly destroyed it during their retreat. After the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang, with the personal "assistance" of the American "Engineering Mission," spent two years without repairing the bridge. Later, it was completely destroyed again during the civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek. Only five battered concrete bridge piers remained between the two mountains, standing lonely against the sky like ancient pagodas, with collapsed abutments and destroyed bridge beams. As the People's Liberation Army marched towards Chiang Kai-shek's final lair, it became an urgent task to quickly repair and open the Longhai Railway, a vital transportation artery connecting Central Plains directly to the Northwest, in order to support the Northwest War, liberate the Great Northwest, and build the Great Northwest. To repair the Longhai Railway, the Eighth Bridge had to be repaired first, otherwise, it would be "impossible to fly across." In August 1949, the Bridge Battalion of the First Detachment of the Railway Corps accepted the arduous task of repairing the Eighth Bridge within three months.
　　"Eighth Summit, Eighth Summit, A Slip Means Falling into Pieces"
　　The main difficulty in repairing the Eighth Bridge was working on the piers. There is a local saying: "Eighth Summit, Eighth Summit, a slip means falling into pieces." According to the engineering plan, the five bridge piers, which were of different heights, had to be leveled to the same height. The taller ones had to be cut down, and the shorter ones had to be filled in, before the beams could be laid. The question was how to climb to the top of these piers, which made people dizzy at first glance, to carry out the work. Among the workers who came with the army, there were many skilled scaffolders from Tianjin and Shanghai. The highest some had climbed was a thirty-seven-meter-high chimney, but they had never even seen a forty-five-meter-high structure. The engineering department initially planned to build a cable suspension bridge, attach a pulley, and use a "bucket" to transport people and materials to each pier to work. However, steel cables could not be bought at the time, and the riverbanks on both sides were rocky, making it impossible to drive piles, so the plan fell through. The second method was to build scaffolding around the piers, requiring 20,000 scaffolding poles and 5,000 kilograms of iron wire. At this time, the Luoyang River pontoon bridge was washed away, transportation was interrupted, and materials could not be delivered. Even if there were materials, the wooden scaffolding would be too high, the supporting force would be too small, and it would be easy for accidents to occur. The problem emerged, and experienced engineers felt helpless. The deadline for opening to traffic was imminent, and no time could be wasted. Faced with these difficulties, all comrades did not waver in the slightest. People said: "Difficulties cannot stop the Communist Party. This time, we must fight a beautiful battle." Everyone made plans and resolutions, actively thinking of solutions.
　　Yang Lian'di Builds a "Ladder to Heaven" to Climb to the Top and Repair the Pier
　　Yang Lian'di was one of these outstanding scaffolders. When he first arrived at the site, he saw a piece of iron clamping plate protruding four inches from the pier surface every three to five meters on the pier. He began to think about how to use it to climb up. He proposed the suggestion of "using the iron clamping plate protruding from the pier surface to build a single-sided ladder to climb up" at the "Zhuge Liang Meeting," but some comrades were afraid of falling halfway up. To avoid unnecessary dangers, the leadership was also carefully considering this suggestion. Yang Lian'di insisted on his suggestion on the one hand and patiently explained it to everyone. On the other hand, he worked with the workers at the blacksmith's furnace to research and create a hooked pole for climbing. After careful consideration, the leadership was convinced that Yang Lian'di had been an electrician and a binder and had many years of climbing skills and experience. They quickly approved his experiment.
　　After the experiment, on the morning of September 4th, Yang Lian'di led eighteen skilled climbers and bravely began to climb. He was the first to raise the hooked pole, hook it onto the first piece of iron clamping plate, and climb up agilely. Then, he steadily used his feet to hold the top of the pole and tied the scaffolding poles handed up from below to the iron plates with iron wire. The comrades below also tied the horizontal poles one by one. Yang Lian'di worked steadily and constantly encouraged and took care of others. The ladder rose section by section, and the figures in the air became smaller and smaller. When it was thirty meters above the ground, the iron clamping plates suddenly became sparse, and the distance between them extended to five meters. The cold wind blew over the top of the mountain, and Yang Lian'di swayed back and forth in the high air. Comrades advised him to come down and rest, but he resolutely refused. At one o'clock in the afternoon, the last hook of eighty-two scaffolding poles was attached to the top of the pier, and the victorious red flag fluttered in the wind at a height of forty-five meters. Cheers erupted on and below the bridge. Villagers nearby ran to watch, calling the ladder the "Ladder to Heaven" and the Railway Corps soldiers "divine soldiers."
　　Immediately afterward, the second combat mission was carried out—leveling the bridge piers. The most arduous project was the second pier, which was only three meters wide on top and needed to be cut away twenty-six cubic meters. Using a hammer would take two months, but the task had to be completed in only ten days. The hero Yang Lian'di stepped forward and stood on the front line again, competing to undertake the task. If explosives were used for blasting, it was feared that the bridge pier would be damaged, so he and Captain Pan worked together to study and use the experience of repairing Bridge No. 71 on the Beining Railway. They used local explosives to blast shallow, sloping holes, using cement bag paper as fuse to lift it down piece by piece. As soon as the blasting work started, he devoted himself, day and night, to the small top of the forty-five-meter-high pier, using only a wooden board as a shield. He repeatedly blasted more than a hundred times in rotation. He endured his thirst and did not go down even when he was hungry. He continued to attack. His ears were deafened, and his head was a little dizzy. The leader personally came to persuade him to rest, but he just smiled and declined. The work of cutting cement on the second bridge pier was finally completed ahead of schedule, and Yang Lian'di climbed down with a smile on his face. Everyone surrounded him and said, "Your sweat has filled the second bridge pier!" He said, "It's nothing. Working for ourselves, it is right to shed the last drop of blood."
　　The Eighth Bridge is Repaired Twenty Days Ahead of Schedule
　　After breaking through the two difficulties of climbing and blasting, all commanders and fighters acted, according to the planned program, not distinguishing between day and night, not fearing the wind and rain, tenacious assault work, As a result, the Eighth Bridge, the most dangerous engineering project on the Longhai Railway, was finally successfully repaired and opened to traffic on October 18, twenty days ahead of the scheduled date. The "Climbing Hero" Yang Lian'di thus established indelible achievements in the People's Liberation War.

　　杨连第登高修建陇海“八号桥”
      支援解放大西北首先要修八号桥
    陇海铁路洛（阳）潼（关）段上，观音堂以西的崇山峻岭中间，有一座全国闻名的高桥梁——八号桥。桥高四十五米，横悬在两山中间，山势飞陡，地形险要，是陇海路上最大险工。这座桥是一九二二年由法、比工程师共同设计，费时四年修建起来的。一九四四年日寇入侵中原，国民党军队撤退时把它彻底破坏。日寇投降以后，国民党在美帝“工程使节团”亲自“帮助”下，费时两年，也没把桥修成，以后在蒋匪发动内战中，又遭彻底的破坏。两山中间只剩下五座遍体鳞伤的洋灰桥墩，像千年古塔一样，孤零零的矗立天际，桥台坍塌，桥梁炸毁。当各路解放大军向蒋匪最后巢穴长驱进军的时候，为了支援西北战争，解放大西北，建设大西北，迅速修复贯通中原，直达西北的交通孔道——陇海路，已经是迫不及待的任务，要修陇海路，不先修好八号桥，就是“插翅也难飞过”的。一九四九年八月，铁道兵团第一支队桥梁大队就接受了限期三月修复八号桥的艰巨任务。
      八号顶，八号顶，失手摔成饼
    修复八号桥的主要困难就是墩上作业，当地有句俗语说“八号顶，八号顶，失手摔成饼。”根据工程计划，必须把五个高低不同的桥墩，铲成同一水平，高的铲掉，低的补足，然后架梁。问题就只在于怎样登上这使人一望就要头晕的墩顶上去进行工作。随军工作的工友里面，有不少是从天津、上海来的高明架子工，最高的有人上过三十七米的大烟筒，四十五米高的工程连看都没有看见过。工程部门最初计划是搭钢索吊桥，绑上滑车，用“吊斗”运送人和材料到每个桥墩上工作。当时钢索买不到，桥梁两岸又是石板地基不能打桩，计划落了空。第二个办法是在桥墩四周搭圈架，共需脚手杆两万根，铁丝五千公斤。这时洛河便桥冲毁，交通中断材料来不到，即使有材料，木架太高支撑力小，又易出危险。困难问题出来了，有经验的工程师也感到没办法。通车限期紧迫，日子万万拖不得。在这些困难面前，全体同志丝毫也没有动摇，人们说：“困难挡不住共产党，这回高低要打他个漂亮仗。”大家纷纷订计划下决心，积极主动想办法。
      杨连第架“天梯”爬到顶上整桥墩
    杨连第就是其中一个出色的架子工，他乍到现场时就看见了桥墩上，每隔三——五米就有突出墩面四英寸的铁夹板一块，他就在心里开始琢磨怎样利用它登上去。他在“诸葛亮会议”上提出：“利用突出墩面的铁夹板搭单面云梯登上去”的建议，但有的同志却怕上到半中腰要掉下来，上级为了避免不必要的危险，也在慎重的考虑这一建议。杨连第一面坚持自己的建议，一面耐心的向大家解释，并和铁匠炉的工友们在一起研究，创造出登高使用的带钩杆子。领导上仔细考虑结果，确信杨连第当过电工、绑架工，有多年的登高技术和经验，很快就批准他进行试验。
    杨连第经过试验，九月四日上午，他带着十八位登高能手，英勇的开始登高，他第一个举起带钩杆子，钩住第一块铁夹板，矫健灵活的顺着杆子爬上去。然后稳重的用两脚扣住杆顶，把下面递上来的脚手杆用铁丝绑在铁板上，下面的同志们也随着他把横杆一根一根的绑上去，杨连第同志一面稳重的工作，一面不断的鼓励照顾别人。云梯一节一节地升上去，空中的人影越来越小，到离地三十米的时候，铁夹板突然稀少，相隔的距离竟延长到五米。寒风越过山顶吹过来，杨连第同志悬在高空中来回摇晃，同志们劝他下来休息，都被坚决的拒绝了。到下午一点钟，八十二根脚手杆子就最后一钩搭上了墩顶，胜利的红旗在四十五米的高空中迎风飘扬，桥上桥下腾起一片欢呼。附近的老乡都跑来围着观看，把云梯叫作“天梯”，称铁道兵团战士为“神兵”。
    紧接着就执行第二个战斗任务—整平桥墩。最艰巨的工程是二号墩，墩顶只有三米宽，需要铲掉二十六立方米，用铁锤打要两个月，任务期限只有十天。英雄杨连第又挺身站在第一线，争先承担任务。如用炸药爆破，恐怕炸坏桥墩，他就和潘中队长合力研究，运用抢修北宁路七十一号桥的经验，使用土药爆破，打斜碴的浅眼，用洋灰袋纸当信管，一块一块往下掀。爆破工作一开始，他便奋不顾身、不分昼夜，在四十五米高的狭小墩顶上，只用一块木头板子做掩护，反复轮番爆破百余次，口渴了忍耐着，肚子饿了也不下去，连续突击，耳朵震聋了，头也有些晕眩，首长亲自来劝他休息，他还是笑一笑推辞了。二号桥墩的铲洋灰工程终于提前竣工，杨连第才满面笑容的爬下来，大家围着他说：“二号桥墩上你的汗都流满了！”他说：“没啥，给自己干活，流尽最后一滴血也是应该的。”
      提前二十天修复八号桥
    突破了登高和爆破这两个难关以后，全体指战员都行动起来了，按照预定计划，不分昼夜，不怕风雨，顽强突击工作，结果，这座陇海铁路上最大险工的八号桥，终于在十月十八日按预定计划提前二十天，胜利修复通车了。“登高英雄”杨连第就这样在人民解放战争中，树立了不可磨灭的功绩。
