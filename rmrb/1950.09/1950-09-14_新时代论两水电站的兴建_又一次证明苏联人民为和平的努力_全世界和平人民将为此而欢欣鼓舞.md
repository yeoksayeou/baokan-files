　　New Era Comments on the Construction of Two Hydropower Stations
    Another Proof of the Soviet People's Efforts for Peace - Peace-loving People All Over the World Will Rejoice For This

    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th] According to TASS, the New Era magazine published an editorial in its 36th issue, commenting on the Soviet Council of Ministers' decision to build the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations, stating that the electricity produced by these two hydroelectric power stations will be much greater than the electricity produced by all the power stations in Italy, Switzerland, or Sweden combined. Among the large-scale construction projects carried out in the Soviet Union in the past, none can compare with these two great projects. This is another brilliant proof of the tremendous surge in the creativity of the Soviet people in the post-war period, the rapid progress of Soviet science and technology, and the infinite potential and superiority of the socialist system.

    The editorial continued: The Soviet people feel boundless joy and justifiable pride in these two important decisions. The Soviet people correctly believe that these new engineering designs are an important link in laying the material and technical foundation for a communist society. They provide new proof of the Soviet people's efforts for peace, and all peace-loving people around the world will rejoice for this, and will therefore be more convinced of their strength and enhance their determination to stop wars and thwart the sinister conspiracies of warmongers.

　　新时代论两水电站的兴建
    又一次证明苏联人民为和平的努力  全世界和平人民将为此而欢欣鼓舞
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：三十六期的新时代杂志发表社论，评论苏联部长会议关于建造古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水力发电站的决定称：这两个水力发电站所生产的电力，将要比意大利、瑞士或瑞典的全国一切的动力站所生产的电力大得多。在苏联过去进行的大规模建设工程中，也没有能与这两个伟大的工程相匹敌的。这又一次光辉地证明了战后苏联人民创造力的巨大高涨，苏联科学和技术的迅速进步，和社会主义制度的无限潜力与优越性。
    社论继称：苏联人民对这两个重要决定感到无限的欢欣和正当的骄傲。苏联人民正确地认为，这些新的工程设计是为共产主义社会奠定物质和技术基础的重要环节。它们给苏联人民为和平的努力提供了新的证明，全世界一切爱好和平的人民，都将为此欢欣鼓舞，并将因此更加确信他们的力量，增强他们制止战争和挫败战争贩子的罪恶阴谋的决心。
