According to a report by Shoji Ogata, Secretary of the League for the Defense of Democracy, the actual number of people throughout Japan who have signed the Stockholm Appeal has exceeded five million, with over 1.7 million signatures collected in Tokyo alone.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Despite the brutal suppression by the police, the people of Hiroshima heroically held a rally against war and advocating for peace on the fifth anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. According to a United Press dispatch: On August 6th, the Hiroshima authorities deployed approximately 4,000 police officers, densely stationed in the urban area and the suburbs, to suppress people from holding gatherings. However, the tight security did not deter the peace-loving people, who took advantage of the gaps in the police patrols and gathered approximately 500 people in front of the Fukuya Department Store in Hatchobori (street name) to hold an anti-war and pro-peace rally, shouting slogans in support of the rally. Some people scattered thousands of leaflets from the upper floors of the Fukuya company. After the meeting, the masses immediately gathered again in front of Hiroshima Station, with the number of people increasing to approximately 600, and held another peace rally. After the meeting, a parade was held, with the marching crowd shouting slogans such as "Long live the cooperation between the Japanese and Korean people!"
Xinhua News Agency, 31st: TASS reported on the 29th, citing the "Democratic Japan" newspaper: A conference was recently held in Sapporo to organize a democratic national front in Hokkaido. Representatives from thirty-eight organizations attended the meeting. They decided to establish a democratic national front in order to conduct a resolute struggle against the splitters of the so-called "Democratic Revival League."
The conference adopted the slogan "The Korean question must be resolved by the Korean people."
