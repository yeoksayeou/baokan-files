Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing: After the complete harvest of early rice, farmers in various parts of the Southwest region are now universally harvesting late rice. This year, the early and late rice crops in Southwest China, with the exception of some areas in Guizhou Province where production suffered due to bandit harassment, and a few other areas where there was a slight reduction in yield due to insect pests or excessive rain, generally achieved around 80% of normal years. The Chengdu Plain and other areas even reached 90%.

The good harvest achieved in the newly liberated areas of Southwest China this year is inseparable from the active leadership of the People's Government and the vigorous assistance of the People's Liberation Army. The victories of the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits in recent months have maintained normal social order, allowing farmers to engage in production with peace of mind. During the spring plowing season, the People's Government issued large amounts of agricultural loans to help farmers solve difficulties in production. According to incomplete statistics from the four districts of Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan, more than 47 million jin of grain were loaned out for spring plowing. At the same time, local People's Governments actively led farmers in repairing dikes, ponds, and canals, facilitating farmland irrigation. For example, this year, the Western Sichuan Administrative Office allocated and advanced a total of 7.8 million jin of water conservancy grain, mobilizing more than 100,000 soldiers and civilians to repair more than 3,000 rivers and ditches. Since the beginning of summer, there has been excessive rainfall, and the People's Government has led farmers in preventing floods. More than 20 counties in Western Sichuan have organized flood prevention committees and established mass flood prevention teams. People's Liberation Army troops were stationed at river dams, finally preventing the occurrence of floods. In addition, when insect pests occurred in a few areas, the People's Government immediately mobilized and organized farmers to fight against the pests, greatly reducing the losses caused by the pests and ensuring a good harvest. Now that the new grain is about to enter the market, in order to prevent a sharp drop in grain prices, the Southwest Trade Department is planning to make appropriate purchases to stabilize grain prices and protect the livelihood of farmers.

　　政府积极领导  部队大力协助
    西南各地稻产丰收
    早稻晚稻一般年景均在八成上下  贸易部将作适当收购以稳定粮价
    【本报讯】据新华社重庆讯：西南区各地农民继早稻全部收完后，现正普遍收割晚稻。今年西南早、晚稻除贵州部分地区因受土匪骚扰生产遭受破坏及其他少数地区因虫灾或雨水过多以致稍有减产外，一般年景均在八成上下，川西平原等地且可达到九成。
    西南新解放区今年获得这样的收成，是与人民政府的积极领导、人民解放军的大力协助分不开的。数月来人民解放军剿匪的胜利，维护了正常的社会秩序，使农民能安心进行生产。人民政府在春耕时即发放了大批农贷，帮助农民解决生产上的困难。据川东、川西、川南、川北四个区不完全的统计，共贷出春耕贷粮四千七百余万斤。同时，各地人民政府又积极领导农民整修堰、塘、水渠，便利了农田灌溉。如川西行署今年拨付与代垫水利米共七百八十万斤，动员军民十余万人，整修河渠，水沟达三千余道。入夏以来，雨水过多，人民政府又领导农民防止水患，川西二十多个县都组织了防洪委员会，成立了群众防洪队，人民解放军部队更驻守河坝，终于制止了水灾的发生。此外，当少数地区发生虫灾时，人民政府又立即动员和组织农民与虫害作斗争，大大减轻了虫灾所招致的损失，保证了良好的收成。现新谷登场在即，为防止谷价猛跌，西南贸易部正拟作适当收购，以稳定粮价，保障农民生活。
