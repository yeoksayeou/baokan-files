    Song Chunhua, Who Transformed the Paper Machine
    Introduction to Industrial Representatives at the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Model Workers, and Advanced Producers, Part 2
    Song Chunhua is a worker at the Tianjin Paper Mill. When people mention him, they naturally think of his achievements in transforming Paper Machine No. 1.
    In February of last year, just over a month after the liberation of Tianjin, Song Chunhua, then a temporary worker, enthusiastically put forward his opinions on transforming Machine No. 1, which had been out of service for more than four years. At the beginning, he encountered difficulties from three sides: On the one hand, some technicians believed that if it could not be transformed well during the Kuomintang period, it was unlikely to be transformed well now. Some of them thought, "If you, a mere worker, can do this, what are we, who rely on technology for a living, going to do!" On the other hand, some backward workers felt that Song Chunhua was deliberately "showing off," and some bad elements even made things difficult for him and attacked him. The third difficulty came from his wife, who felt that he was burying himself in the machines all day long, not helping her take care of the children or housework, so she opposed him "messing with those machines."
    Song Chunhua did not lose heart. His courage and perseverance repelled these difficulties from within and without. With the support of the military representative, he carried out half a month of repair and transformation work on the paper machine. On April 11, 1949, Machine No. 1 was restarted, and because it did not require viscous raw materials after the transformation, it could save the cost of raw materials worth 1,000 catties of corn flour every day and night, and save twenty-three workers per shift, creating enormous wealth for the factory.
    For a considerable period after liberation, the leading cadres of the Tianjin Paper Mill had serious bureaucratic work styles. More than a thousand suggestions from workers on reforming the system, improving machines, and saving resources were not resolved in a timely manner, and accidents occurred frequently. At that time, due to the lack of democratic style of the leading cadres, the workers were dissatisfied with the leaders and dared not criticize them. At the first Tianjin Municipal Trade Union Member Representative Congress, Song Chunhua reported these serious problems to Mayor Huang Jing. However, at that time, the leading cadres of the factory still adopted an attitude of dissatisfaction and embarrassment towards Song Chunhua's criticism. Although he encountered some setbacks, Song Chunhua still did not lose heart. What occupied his mind every day was not the leadership's dissatisfaction with him, but how to increase the daily output of Machine No. 1 from seven tons to seven and a half tons.
    During the great competition movement in May of this year, Song Chunhua actively promoted the work of the paper making workshop: persuading those who were unwilling to compete, helping groups to formulate plans, and maximizing the productivity of Machine No. 3, increasing the daily output from eight tons to twenty-two tons at one point, winning the red flag five times in a row, and reducing the paper loss rate of Machine No. 1 from 7% to 5%.
    Glory belongs to the advanced producers. Song Chunhua, who was a temporary worker just over a year ago, has now been promoted to deputy director of the paper making workshop. He is also a standing committee member of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and a first-class model worker in the city. Now, he has been gloriously selected as a representative of Tianjin to attend the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Model Workers, and Advanced Producers. (Reprinted from Tianjin Daily)

### 改造造纸机的宋春化  工农兵劳模大会工业代表介绍之二

　　改造造纸机的宋春化
    工农兵劳模大会工业代表介绍之二
    宋春化是天津造纸厂工人，人们一提到他，自然地便会想起他改造一号造纸机的事迹来。
    去年二月天津解放不过一个多月的时候，作为一个临时工的宋春化，便热情地提出了改造一号机的意见，当时一号机已停车四年多。开始他遇到了三方面的困难：一方面，部分技术人员认为国民党时期改造不好，现在也不见得能改造得好，他们有的这样想：“你这个小工若能干这事，我们这专门靠技术吃饭的还干啥呀！”另一方面，部分落后工人觉得宋春化是故意“显能”，个别坏分子还从中作难，打击他。第三个困难来自他的老婆，老婆觉得他一天到晚埋头于机器中间，不帮助她照顾孩子，照顾家务，因此反对他“搞那机器的玩意”。
    宋春化没有气馁，他的勇气和毅力击退了这些内外袭来的困难。在军代表的支持下，他对造纸机进行了半个月的修理改造工作。一九四九年四月十一日，一号机重新开车了，并且因为改造后不用黏性原料，一天一夜可节省值一千斤玉米面的原料费，每班可以省二十三个工，给工厂创造了巨大的财富。
    天津纸厂的领导干部，于解放后一个相当长的时期内，存在着严重的官僚主义作风。工人提出一千多条关于改革制度，改进机器以及节约的意见，都没有及时解决，事故层出不穷。那时候，由于领导干部缺乏民主作风，工人不满意领导，也不敢批评。在天津第一届工会会员代表大会时，宋春化便向黄敬市长反映了这些严重问题。但是，当时该厂领导干部对宋春化的批评，还采取了不满和为难的态度。虽然遭遇到一些挫折，宋春化仍旧没有气馁，每天盘旋在他脑子里为他念念不忘的，并不是领导上对他不满的问题，而是考虑如何把一号机的日产量由七吨增加到七吨半。
    在今年五月的大竞赛运动中，宋春化积极推动造纸车间的工作：说服不愿意竞赛的人，帮助小组订计划，使三号机发挥了最大的生产力，日产量由八吨一度增至二十二吨，连得五次红旗，一号机的损纸率由百分之七降到百分之五。
    光荣归于生产先进者。一年多以前还是临时工的宋春化，今天已被提升为造纸车间副主任，他还是市总工会的常委，全市的一等模范。现在，他又光荣获选为天津市出席全国劳模代表会议的代表了。（转载自天津日报）
