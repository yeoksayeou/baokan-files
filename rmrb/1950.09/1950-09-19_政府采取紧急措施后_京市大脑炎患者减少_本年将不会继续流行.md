[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Since the encephalitis epidemic broke out in Beijing in mid-August, the Municipal People's Government, with the strong assistance of the Central Ministry of Health, has taken emergency prevention measures. Now the number of patients is decreasing daily; at the same time, due to seasonal changes, it will not continue to be an epidemic this year.

　　When the encephalitis epidemic was at its worst on August 19 this year, there were 24 patients in one day. In view of the increase in patients, the Municipal Health Committee quickly arranged mosquito eradication work. Since the Central Ministry of Health convened an emergency meeting on the prevention of encephalitis on August 29, and the Municipal People's Government convened a propaganda mobilization meeting on August 31, public security police stations, district trade union offices, and youth and women's organizations carried out extensive and in-depth propaganda; the Central Ministry of Health also sent an epidemic prevention team of more than 300 staff members to various districts to assist in the work. The Municipal Construction Bureau, the Sanitation Engineering Bureau, the Civil Affairs Bureau and other units blocked more than 5,000 tree holes in the city. According to the working principle of "promoting organization at all levels, propaganda and education, and key inspections," various districts mobilized health team leaders to mobilize citizens to universally plug tree holes, dump stagnant water in jars and pots, and eradicate mosquitoes and mosquito larvae. The 12th Police Station of the First District completed the work of plugging tree holes and dumping jars and pots in each household within its jurisdiction in one day; the staff of the Central Epidemic Prevention General Team helped citizens work from morning to night. More than 14,000 students from 54 primary schools in the Fourth District and the district's doctors participated in the propaganda work. Through this prevention work, citizens generally had a preliminary understanding of what encephalitis is and how to prevent it, laying a good foundation for next year's prevention work.
