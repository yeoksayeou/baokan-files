　　Introduction of Representatives to the National Congress of Laborers, Peasants and Soldiers
    Li Yonglu, Special Class Labor Hero of Tianjin Railway Bureau
    Li Yonglu has a keen sense for new things. He and his partners were the first to contract Engine No. 1939, achieving excellent results and earning the title of Special Class Labor Hero of the Tianjin Railway Bureau.
    Chief Driver Li Yonglu and his partners drive the MK① No. 1939 locomotive every day, pulling long trains full of cargo, speeding across the fertile fields between Beijing and Tianjin. During their runs, they exceeded three Class A inspections and traveled 150,000 Class A inspection kilometers, setting the highest mileage record for the Tianjin Railway Bureau.
    Li Yonglu was originally an ordinary railway worker. He has been on the railway for more than 20 years, starting from the small job of wiping down trains. Last March, before the Tianjin Railway started implementing the contract system, he heard about the contract system from a People's Liberation Army comrade who had been a driver in the Northeast. So he united with Bai Lianrui, Zhang Jingzhi, and others to take the lead in contracting Engine No. 1939. At first, they were ridiculed by some backward workers in the section, who said this kid was just showing off. But the new system was scientific and reasonable after all. Li Yonglu's Engine No. 1939 contract group constantly overcame difficulties and made steady progress day by day.
    At first, the locomotive was like a mud ball and needed to be wiped clean. Zhou Ximing and Ma Yuhe, who loved cleanliness, were unwilling to do it, so Li Yonglu took the lead in getting under the train to wipe it. But Zhou Ximing and Ma Yuhe could not keep up with everyone's progress. Someone once suggested: "Request the section chief to replace them!" Li Yonglu always shook his head, thinking: "I'll do more myself, explain more to them, and they will slowly improve." From the old hero Li Yong, of the Mao Zedong locomotive, he absorbed the experience of holding criticism meetings, took the lead in self-criticism, and helped each other progress. Every new thing made them feel a new force. At this time, they had traveled more than 7,000 kilometers and received a collective bonus of 20,000 yuan.
    The sense of ownership encouraged people to display their wisdom and talent, and the honor of new heroism inspired everyone. Zhou Ximing and Ma Yuhe also gradually became more progressive and active. From then on, Li Yonglu's contract group became more united. Li Yonglu very carefully paid attention to the improvement of technical speed. When he accepted a shift, he always carefully calculated the maximum mileage of the technical speed. He often went to the engine house to discuss with others how to improve the technical speed, and to check whether the stoker was working hard enough and whether the coal was being wasted. Therefore, in January this year, other locomotives burned seven tons of coal from Fengtai to Tianjin, while they only used 4.5 tons.
    The growth of the Engine No. 1939 contract group came from Li Yonglu's efforts to humbly learn from others and unite and transform the surrounding staff. Li Yonglu's glorious achievements have won the love of the vast number of railway workers. Last November, at the Tianjin Railway Workers' Congress, he was selected as a special-class labor hero and became the banner of locomotives in the entire bureau. From then on, the Li Yonglu movement was launched throughout the entire railway, and thousands of train crews learned from his example, improved their performance, and worked hard for the bright future of their motherland. Li Yonglu's honor has increased day by day along with his achievements. In March this year, he was also selected as a member of the Chinese delegation to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Hungary, representing the Chinese people and expressing sincere friendship to the Hungarian people. He has now been promoted to Deputy Director of Operations of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot.

    Zhang Fa, Leading the Masses Towards a Prosperous Life
    Zhang Fa is a special-class model cadre in Heilongjiang Province and is currently the secretary of the Jian'guo Village Party Branch in Zhaoyuan County. He is deeply loved by the masses for his active leadership in carrying out land reform and promoting production.
    Before the land reform, Jian'guo Village was a notorious flood-stricken village along the Songhua River in Zhaoyuan County, where crops were lost in nine out of ten years. In 1948, out of more than 380 hectares of land in the village, 237 hectares of seeds were lost, and more than 130 houses were flooded. All 755 farmers in the village had nothing to eat or burn and were crowded into 150 houses that had not been flooded, living a difficult and miserable life. The masses had no way to live and wanted to leave this place and find another way out. Some households had no heart to engage in production and sold their horses to exchange for food. Faced with this serious difficulty, Zhang Fa and all the Communist Party members in the village bravely stood at the forefront of production and construction, leading the masses to fight against serious production and living difficulties. Zhang Fa united the party members and the masses, tried to make fishing tools, organized the masses to dig dams to release water to catch fish, and rescued the waterlogged land. The fish were sold for more than 800 million yuan (Northeast currency), exchanged for more than 170 shi of grain, more than 7,000 chi of cloth, 57 cattle and horses, and some farm tools. In the spring of 1949, the difficulty of planting was still great. Not only were people short of food and horses short of feed, but more importantly, there was insufficient horsepower. Out of 387 hectares of land in the village, there were only 50 horses of all sizes. Zhang Fa, relying on his prestige among the masses, rented 41 cattle from other places, but these cattle had never been harnessed and did not know how to plow the land, and all needed to be taught. Zhang Fa patiently learned the methods from Shi Fu, who had experience in teaching cattle to plow the land, learned it and then helped everyone learn. In seven or eight days, all the cattle were taught to pull the plow. Just after plowing the first field, the masses ran out of food, and many people wanted to move again. He mobilized party members to mobilize their wives to go fishing, and promoted more than 80 women in the village to go fishing together, exchanging fish for 27 shi of grain, plus government loans, and persevered in completing three plows and three trips. After hanging up the hoe, in order to eliminate the flood forever, Zhang Fa and all the party members of the branch organized the masses to repair the dam in advance, and repaired an eight-li-long river dam in six days, and dug more than 100 drainage ditches. It rained heavily three days after the repair. The masses reflected: "Zhang Fa has a way to do everything, and it is right to learn from him." In this way, after a year of fighting against various difficulties, they finally won the victory, ensuring the bumper harvest of 479 hectares of land (according to the original 380 hectares of land in the village, there is land that was later increased and reclaimed) for the whole year, and harvested 2,700 shi of grain. After the autumn harvest, he led the masses of the whole village to launch a sideline production campaign, with an income of 1.2 billion yuan, buying 67 horses, 14 cattle, 14 carts, 700 pieces of soybean cakes, and more than 12,000 chi of cloth, an average of 16 chi per person, and also bought 85 new sheepskin jackets, made a new cotton coat and a new cotton quilt for each person, and there was surplus grain in addition to food. This gradually led Jian'guo Village from poverty to prosperity, living a happy life.
    This year, Zhang Fa has again led the masses to reclaim 310 hectares of wasteland. In order to solve the difficulty of housing, 250 new houses were built in the village, and every family has a house to live in. However, when the construction of houses began this spring, the masses did not completely agree. Some felt that it was enough to eat and did not want to do more. Zhang Fa, on the one hand, used the difficulties and hardships of the previous two years to break the masses' complacency, and on the other hand, took the lead in demonstrating. At the beginning of spring, when the ground had just thawed, he ran to the Dianzi once a day to check how it was thawing. When it had just thawed enough to reclaim wasteland, he put on the plow himself to reclaim it. At that time, others said that it could not be reclaimed, but he used the fact that he reclaimed more than one hectare in one day to convince everyone. The next day, 30 plows were sent out in the whole village to reclaim wasteland, and in 13 days, the plan to reclaim 150 hectares was exceeded by one time.
    Because he realized that his leading role was great, since he became a cadre, he has always participated in production and led production, and he has always been the first to do things in various productions, and has always participated in the front of the Xu Bingkun group, so that all kinds of work in the group are done in front of the whole village. The villagers all reflect that: "Zhang Fa is our good leader."
    Zhang Fa summed up his own experience and said: "If you want to live a prosperous life, you must actively produce and engage in sideline production. Cadres must participate in production and do everything first, and they can become as rich as the masses." He is right, now the life of the masses in the whole village has risen, and his life has also risen. He now has 10 hectares of land, four new houses, three large horses, four cattle, and more than a dozen sheep; and he also has surplus grain for three years. There are more than 40 households in the village similar to him. The current Jian'guo Village is "heaven and earth" compared to 1947. This year, the village has a total of 267 cattle and horses, an increase of 222.5 percent compared to before the land reform, and the sown area has reached 871 hectares, an increase of more than 225 percent compared to before the land reform. One-half of the households have surplus grain. Pigs and sheep are walking all over the streets in the village, and chickens and ducks are everywhere. Adults and children are wearing good and neat clothes. There is a winter school in winter and a literacy class in summer, and more than 70 women participate. The villagers all happily say: "Jian'guo Village has changed."

　　工农兵劳模代表会议代表介绍
    天津路局特等功臣李永禄
    李永禄对新鲜事物有锐敏的感觉，他和他的伙伴们第一个包乘了一九三九号机车，做出了很好的成绩，荣膺天津路局的特等功臣。
    李永禄司机长和他的伙伴，每天驾驶着ㄇㄎ①一九三九号机车，拖着满载而绵长的车皮奔驰在京津间富饶的原野上。他们走行中曾超过三个多甲检，走行了十五万甲检公里。创造天津路局的最高走行纪录。
    李永禄原是个平常的铁路工人。从擦车小工作起，在铁路上已有二十多年。去年三月，天津铁路还未开始实行包乘制时，他从一位在东北当过司机的解放军同志那里听到包乘制的办法，于是他团结了白莲瑞、张静之等带头包了一九三九号机车。开始他们受到同段某些落后工友的奚落，说这小子净出“洋相”。可是新的制度毕竟是科学合理的，李永禄领导的一九三九号机车包乘组不断克服着困难，一天天的巩固与进步着。
    起初，机车像个泥蛋，要擦，爱干净的伙伴周希明，马玉鹤不愿意干，李永禄就带头钻到车底去擦。但周希明、马玉鹤总追不上大家的进步。曾有人提议：“请求段长换了他俩吧！”李永禄总是摇头，他想：“自己多干点，多向他们解说，慢慢就会进步的。”由毛泽东号李永老英雄那里，他吸收了开检讨会的经验，带头检讨，彼此互相帮助进步。每一件新鲜事物使他们感到一种新的力量。这时他们走行了七千多公里，得了两万元的集体奖金。
    主人翁思想策励着人们发挥智慧与才能，新的英雄主义的荣誉鼓舞着大家。周希明、马玉鹤也逐渐进步与积极起来。从此李永禄的包乘组团结得更加紧密了，李永禄非常谨慎的注意技术速度的提高，当他接受一次乘务的时候，他总精心的计算技术速度的最高里程，他常到车房去和别人研究如何提高技术速度，检查司炉吃劲不吃劲以及用煤浪费不浪费。因此，今年一月间，别的机车由丰台到天津要烧七吨煤，而他们就只用四．五吨。
    一九三九号机车包乘组的成长，是从李永禄虚心向人学习和团结改造周围工作人员而努力得来的。李永禄的光荣业绩，得到了广大铁路工人的爱戴。去年十一月，天津路局工代大会上他被选为特等功臣，成为全局机车的旗帜。从此全路澎湃的展开了李永禄运动，千百个乘务员学习着他的榜样，提高了自己的成绩，为自己祖国美好的将来而努力。李永禄的荣誉，便随着他的功绩日益提高。今年三月间，又被选为出席庆祝匈牙利五周年中国代表团团员之一，代表中国人民，向匈牙利人民表示了热诚的友谊。现又提升为丰台机务段的运转副主任。

    领导群众走向富裕生活的张发
    张发是黑龙江省的特等模范干部，现任中共肇源县建国村支部书记，因他积极领导农民进行土地改革，搞好生产，很受群众爱戴。
    建国村在土地改革前是肇源县沿松花江边出名的水灾村，种的庄稼十年九不收。一九四八年，全村三百八十多垧地即有二百三十七垧籽粒不见，淹倒房子一百三十多间，全村七百五十五个农民没吃没烧，挤在没被淹着的一百五十间房子里，过着艰难困苦的生活。群众生活没法，都想离开这块地方，别投生路。有的户没心搞生产，卖马换吃粮。面对着这种严重困难，张发和本村中共支部全体党员，便勇敢的站在生产建设的最前面，领导群众向严重的生产和生活困难展开了斗争。张发团结了党员、群众，设法做打鱼工具，组织群众挖坝放水捕鱼，救出涝地。打鱼卖了八亿多元（东北币），换一百七十多石粮，七千多尺布，五十七头牛马和一部分农具。一九四九年春天种地困难还是很大，不光人缺吃粮马缺草料，更重要的是马力不足，全村三百八十七垧地，大小马只有五十匹，张发凭着自己在群众中的威信，从外地租进四十一头牛，可是这些牛都没上过套不会种地，都需要现教。张发耐心的向教牛种地有经验的石富学习办法，学会了再帮助大家学，七、八天的工夫把牛都教会拉套了。刚铲完头遍地，群众吃粮就没有了，很多人又想搬家。他发动党员动员自己的老婆，下水打鱼，推动全村八十多名妇女一齐出动，打鱼换粮二十七石，加上政府贷粮，坚持完成了三铲三趟。挂锄后为永远除掉水灾，张发和支部全体党员同志便提前组织群众修坝，六天修好八里长的江坝，挖了一百多道顺水沟。修好三天后就下了大雨。群众反映：“张发干啥都有办法，跟他学习没错。”这样向各种困难斗争了一年，终于胜利了，保证全年耕种的四百七十九垧地（按全村原有地三百八十垧，这里有后来增加开垦的地）的丰收，打了二千七百石粮。秋收又带起全村群众展开副业生产运动，收入十二亿，买进六十七匹马，十四头牛，十四辆车，七百块豆饼，还买进布一万二千多尺，平均每人十六尺，还买了八十五身新羊皮袄，每人做了一套新棉衣，一床新棉被，除了吃的还有余粮。使建国村逐渐由贫困走向富裕，过着幸福的生活。
    今年张发又领导群众开荒三百一十垧。为解决住房子的困难，全村盖新房子二百五十间，家家都有一座房子住。但是今春开始盖房时群众并不是完全同意的，有的觉着够吃就不想多干了。张发一方面用前二年的困难苦处打破群众自满情绪，一面自己带头示范。春天地刚开化的时候，他就一天一趟跑到甸子检查化的怎样。刚化够能开荒的时候，他自己先套了犁杖去开，当时别人都说不能开，他用一天开出一垧多的事实说服了大家。第二天全村出动三十多付犁杖开荒，十三天的时间超过原来开一百五十垧的计划的一倍。
    由于他体会了自己带头作用大，从当干部以后，一直是参加生产领导生产，在进行各种生产时都是自己先干在头前，一直参加在许秉坤小组打头，使小组各样活都干在全村前面。全村老乡都反映说：“张发是我们好打头的。”
    张发总结自己的经验说：“要想生活富裕，就得积极生产搞副业。当干部的得参加生产，啥事都干在头前，自己就能和群众一样富。”他说的对，现在全村群众的生活上升了，他的生活也上升了。他现在有十垧地，四间新房子，三匹大马，四头牛，十多只羊；还存有三年的余粮。全村和他相仿的有四十多户。现在的建国村和一九四七年比，是“天上地下”。今年全村共有牛、马二百六十七头，比土改前增加百分之二百二十二点五，播种面积达到八百七十一垧，比土改前增加到百分之二百二十五强。有余粮户占二分之一。屯子里猪、羊满街走，鸡、鸭到处有，大人、小孩都穿好很整齐的衣服，冬天有冬学，夏天有识字班，光妇女就有七十多人参加。老乡们都欢乐的说：“建国村变样了。”
