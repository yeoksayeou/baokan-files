　　Electing Delegates to the National Congress of Combat Heroes
    Beijing Garrison Headquarters Holds Meeting of Heroes and Model Workers
    Special-Class Combat Hero Wang Ru Elected, Commander Lü Attends and Delivers Speech
    [By Our Newspaper] The Beijing Garrison Headquarters of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government held a meeting of combat heroes and model workers of the entire headquarters on August 25th and 26th, and elected Special-Class Combat Hero Wang Ru as a delegate to the National Congress of Combat Heroes.
    Prior to the meeting, all units of the headquarters conducted widespread mobilization and deliberation, collecting and compiling the deeds of heroes and model workers. After each unit separately convened a military personnel meeting, twenty-two representatives of combat heroes and model workers were elected to attend the meeting of combat heroes and model workers of the entire headquarters. Eight meritorious personnel with major merits or above were also invited to participate in the meeting. After the heroic and model deeds were reported at the meeting, the group discussed and researched, and proposed five candidates, including the explosives hero and Special-Class Meritorious Personnel Wu Changji, who had established three merits in a row in the Qingfengdian annihilation battle; Special-Class Meritorious Personnel Wang Ru, who won the first merit in the Zhengding liberation battle; Fu Fengxiang, a major meritorious personnel for five counterattacks in the Beihedian defensive battle; Qi Xianyou, a major meritorious personnel in the Haizhou sniper battle; and Song Xinkong, a model worker for guard duty. The delegates present believed that Comrade Wang Ru had outstanding combat achievements, had previously been recognized for merit five times, and was also a model of learning and a model of performing duties. He had also made four minor contributions in guarding the capital, so they unanimously elected him as a delegate to the National Congress of Combat Heroes.
    Commander Lü of the headquarters attended the meeting and delivered a speech, hoping that Comrade Wang Ru would bring the achievements and experiences of the Beijing Garrison Headquarters in defending the capital for more than a year to the National Congress of Combat Heroes, and bring back the instructions of the leaders and the valuable experiences of fraternal units from the conference, and convey them to the entire headquarters to improve work and build the Beijing Garrison Headquarters into a strong and modern guard force to defend the people's capital and protect the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao.
    The combat heroes present spoke in succession, reporting their impressions and gains from participating in the meeting. Some meritorious comrades also reviewed their shortcomings at the meeting, expressing that they would work harder in the future. For example, Special Meritorious Explosives Hero Wu Changji, after reviewing his shortcomings of not loving to study culture, said: "From today onwards, I will resolutely overcome my shortcomings and stand at the forefront in work and study to be a role model for the masses."

　　选举出席全国战斗英雄大会代表
    北京纠察总队举行英模会议
    特等战斗英雄王儒当选，吕司令员亲临致词
    【本报讯】中央人民政府公安部北京纠察总队于八月二十五、二十六两日召开了全总队战斗英雄及工作模范代表会议，选出特等战斗英雄王儒为出席全国战斗英雄大会的代表。
    会前，全总队各单位曾普遍进行动员酝酿，收集并整理了英模事迹。经各单位分别召开军人大会，选出了战斗英雄及工作模范代表二十二人出席全总队的战斗英雄及工作模范代表会议。会议并邀请了大功以上功臣八人参加。会上报告了英雄模范事迹后，经小组讨论研究，提出了五名候选人，包括在清风店大歼灭战中连建三功的爆炸英雄特等功臣武昌继；在解放正定战役中获登城第一功的特等功臣王儒；北河店防御战五次反冲锋大功功臣傅凤祥；海州狙击战大功功臣齐宪友和警卫工作模范宋欣孔。到会代表认为王儒同志战功卓著，以前曾立功五次，而且又是学习模范和执行勤务的模范，在担任警卫首都任务中又立了四小功，因此一致票选他为出席全国战斗英雄大会的代表。
    总队吕司令员曾到会致词，希望王儒同志将纠察总队一年多来卫戍首都的成绩和经验带到全国战斗英雄大会上去，并将大会上各首长的指示和各兄弟部队宝贵的经验带回来，向全总队传达报告，以提高工作，使纠察总队建设成一支强有力的、现代化的警卫部队，捍卫人民首都，保卫中央人民政府和毛主席。
    到会的战斗英雄相继发言，报告参加会议的感想与收获。有的功臣同志并在会上检讨了自己的缺点，表示今后将更加努力。如特功爆炸英雄武昌继在检讨了自己不爱学文化的缺点之后，说：“从今天起，我坚决克服我的缺点，在工作、学习中，都要站到最前面去，做群众的榜样。”
