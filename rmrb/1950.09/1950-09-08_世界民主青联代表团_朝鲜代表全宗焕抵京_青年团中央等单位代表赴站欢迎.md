He said passionately: "The Korean people and youth are currently victoriously advancing to eliminate the American invaders. Although the American imperialists are viciously and barbarously wreaking havoc on the Korean people, the Korean people, with the warm support of the great Soviet Union, China, and peace-loving people all over the world, have full confidence in victory, and are united as one under the banner of the Republic, determined to finally drive the American aggressors out of Korean territory."
