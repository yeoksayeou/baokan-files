The CPC Fushun Municipal Committee Convenes Meeting of Factory and Mine Cadres
Corrects Deviations of Rectification Campaign Lacking Focus and Purpose
Determines Key Issues Such as Inspecting and Consolidating Labor Discipline

[This newspaper's report] In the rectification movement in Fushun City, Northeast China, deviations occurred such as too much content, a lack of focus, and separate rectification campaigns by the Party, government, and labor unions. The CPC Municipal Committee convened a meeting of responsible comrades from various factories and mines to begin correcting these issues. First, the rectification content in various factories and mines was too extensive, failing to grasp the most central issues for enterprises. That is, it failed to focus on how to improve and enhance operation and management, and to inspect and summarize several key tasks. For example, some factories and mines raised seven or eight major issues at once, ranging from the quality of basic construction and costs to Party work and trade union work; some even raised as many as fourteen. Too many issues made it impossible to resolve them. This was a significant deviation in the rectification. Second, some units conducted separate rectification campaigns for the Party, government, and labor unions, each rectifying its own issues, instead of jointly addressing important production problems (such as economic accounting and technical management), and studying how to improve work and how the Party, government, and labor union could cooperate correctly. Instead, the Party and the trade union isolated themselves to rectify how to achieve guarantee and supervision. As a result, the relationship between the Party, government, and labor union became increasingly disconnected. Third, some units confused the work inspection in the rectification with general democratic movements criticizing leaders. Therefore, they replaced the rectification movement, which involves leaders personally inspecting and summarizing work from top to bottom, with a series of various mass meetings to solicit opinions from the masses. Furthermore, in reading documents, some units limited themselves to the basic rectification documents designated by the Northeast Bureau and did not understand the need to add necessary documents directly related to their unit's business (such as decisions and instructions on issues such as economic accounting and technical management in industry). As a result, they fell into general work inspections and summaries. The Municipal Committee decided to take the following measures to correct these issues: (1) In terms of rectification content, based on the specific situation of Fushun City, it was decided to focus on three issues as the main content: The first is to consolidate labor discipline. This is one of the most serious problems at present, and it has seriously harmed the safety and quality and efficiency of production in factories and mines. The second is to inspect the implementation of the economic accounting system in various specific tasks, liquidate the supply mentality, analyze the reasons, and improve work. The third is technical management. This includes the responsibility system, quality, safety, and the unity and correct use of technical personnel. (2) In terms of rectification methods, it was decided that the Party, government, and labor union would rectify together, focusing on several key issues in current economic management to study how to cooperate and how to enable the Party to delve into production and guarantee production. However, when studying their own business, the Party, government, and labor union can still be separated. (3) The idea of confusing rectification with general promotion of democracy was criticized, pointing out that rectification should be led by leading cadres; when necessary, discussion meetings can be organized on a specific issue to absorb mass opinions and help the leadership in rectification. (4) In terms of reading documents, it was decided that when rectifying a certain issue, relevant decisions and instructions should be read as weapons to guide and inspect and summarize work.

　　中共抚顺市委召开厂矿干部会议
    纠正整风无中心无目的偏向
    确定检查巩固劳动纪律等主要问题
    【本报讯】东北抚顺市的整风运动中，发生内容太多、缺乏中心和党政工各自单独整风等偏向，该市中共市委，即召开各厂矿负责同志会议，着手纠正。首先各厂矿整风的内容太多，没有抓住企业中最中心的问题。也就是说没有围绕着如何改进与提高经营管理这一中心问题，来检查总结几项主要工作。如有的厂矿，从基本建设质量，成本到党的工作，工会工作，一下子提了七八个大问题；甚至还有十四个之多的。问题太多，就无法解决。这是整风中一个重要的偏向。其次，若干单位是把党、政、工分开整风，各整各的，不是共同面对生产上的重要问题（如经济核算、技术管理等），从这里来研究如何改进工作及党、政、工如何正确的配合。而是党与工会孤立地去整如何实现保证监督。结果愈整党、政、工的关系愈脱节。再次若干单位，把整风中的工作检查和一般的批评领导的民主运动混淆起来。因此，用一连串的各种各样的群众性的座谈会，征求群众意见，代替了从上到下、领导干部亲自动手来检查和总结工作的整风运动，还有在阅读文件上，若干单位局限于东北局指定的几个基本的整风文件，还不懂得增加上一些和本单位业务有直接关系的必要的文件（如关于工业的经济核算、技术管理等问题的决定，指示等等）。因此，陷入一般化的检查总结工作中。该市市委即决定采取以下几个办法进行纠正：（一）在整风内容上，根据抚顺市具体情况，确定以三个问题为主要内容：第一是巩固劳动纪律。这在目前是最严重的问题之一，它已严重地危害着厂矿的安全与生产的质量和效率。第二是检查经济核算制在各种具体工作中贯彻的情形，清算供给观点，分析原因，改进工作。第三是技术管理。包括责任制、质量、安全及团结与正确的使用技术人员等问题。（二）在整风方法上，决定党、政、工一块整，从目前经济管理的几个主要问题上，研究如何配合，如何使党深入生产，保证生产。但在研究本身业务时，党、政、工还可分开。（三）批判了把整风与一般的发扬民主相混淆的思想，指出整风以领导干部为主；必要时可就某一问题，组织座谈会，吸收群众意见，帮助领导上整风。（四）在阅读文件上，决定整那个问题，即阅读有关的决定指示，以此作为指导与检查总结工作的武器。（中共抚顺市委）
