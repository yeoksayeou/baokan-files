Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: The National Rural Youth Work Conference convened by the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has defined different tasks for the Youth League in old liberated areas, newly liberated areas, and ethnic minority regions. The conference decided that the tasks of the Youth League in old liberated areas are to achieve agricultural production increase plans and carry out cultural and educational work; the tasks of the Youth League in newly liberated areas are to mobilize rural youth to participate in land reform and rent reduction, and fight against local bullies; as for carrying out youth work and establishing the League in ethnic minority regions, a steady and cautious approach should be adopted.

The conference lasted for a total of eleven days and closed on August 31st. The conference listened to the speech by Jiang Nanxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League, at the opening ceremony, the report by Xu Shiping, Minister of the Youth and Agriculture Department of the Central Committee of the League, on youth work in old and new rural areas, and the concluding remarks by Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the League. The conference also invited Li Shucheng, Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, to report on the current agricultural production; Bo Yibo, Deputy Director of the Central Financial and Economic Committee, reported on the issue of cooperatives, and Guo Moruo reported on the campaign to promote the peace signature movement in rural areas. Liao Luyan, Deputy Director of the Policy Research Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report on land reform policies and the classification of class components. The conference mainly resolved the following issues:

	Tasks in Old Liberated Areas: Achieve Agricultural Production Increase Plans and Carry Out Cultural and Educational Work
In the old liberated areas, the primary task of the Youth League is to fight under the leadership of the Party to complete the agricultural production increase plan of the People's Government and the Party. In the production movement, the Youth League must unite the vast number of young people and adults to play an active role in the four tasks of organizing, improving technology, solving supply and marketing, and combining agriculture and sideline occupations. The organization of mutual aid in production must adhere to the principles of voluntariness and equivalent exchange. Generally, youth mutual aid groups should not be organized separately from families. Organization should be combined with improving technology and promoting new farm tools to further improve and consolidate mutual aid groups. At the same time, small-scale, short-term, and temporary mutual aid groups should also be actively organized and led. Youth League organizations should lead and help League members and young people learn agricultural production technology through visits, symposiums, technical research groups, newspapers, and periodicals. League cadres should first learn technology, bring technology to the countryside, and lead League members to achieve results. In order to improve the labor enthusiasm and production achievements of the vast number of young people, the Youth League should mobilize young people to carry out agricultural production competitions through mass methods such as comparing cultivation, comparing technology, and comparing crops. Rewards and promotion should be given to young people's achievements and creations, and various youth labor models should be cultivated and discovered to set examples.

Secondly, the Youth League in the old liberated areas should strive to carry out cultural and educational work in rural areas under the principle of not hindering production and serving production. First of all, it should assist the government in running people's schools and carry out literacy campaigns in rural areas. All Youth League members in rural areas, especially cadres among League members, should actively participate in cultural learning and strive to eliminate illiteracy and semi-literacy among League cadres within two years. This is an important key to improving the League's work in rural areas.

In addition, the Youth League should also care about and help solve the youth's own problems, such as marriage issues and cultural and recreational activities.

	Tasks in Newly Liberated Areas: Fully Mobilize Young Farmers to Participate in Land Reform, Rent Reduction, and Anti-Bully Campaigns
The main task of the Youth League in the newly liberated areas is to fully mobilize young farmers to participate in the struggle for land reform, rent reduction, and anti-bully campaigns together with all farmers. The guiding principle for establishing the League in the new areas should be to establish the League organization under leadership, step by step, and steadily, based on subjective and objective conditions. The League Committee must first prepare and train League cadres. In the steps of establishing the League, first, young farmers should be mobilized to participate in peasant associations and militia, and carry out struggles together with all farmers. Then, the activists who emerge from the movement should be admitted into the League after necessary education, based on consciousness and voluntariness. Then, the organizational strength of the League should be used to further promote the development of the movement.

Regarding carrying out youth work and establishing the League in ethnic minority areas, the conference believed that a steady and cautious approach must be adopted, without being impetuous and mechanically applying the working methods and experience of the Han areas. It is necessary to first train cadres of ethnic minorities and enhance the friendship and unity of young people of all ethnic groups. Then, according to the requirements and level of awareness of the local ethnic minority youth, youth work should be carried out prudently and gradually from urban areas to rural areas. After the conditions for establishing the League are met, the League should be established from points to areas.

Regardless of whether it is a new or old liberated area, the Youth League must play a role in rural work and among young people. It should strengthen the political and ideological education of League members and systematically teach current affairs policies, basic knowledge of the League, and basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This ideological and political education should be carried out in conjunction with actual struggles and work.

According to the situation of the League across the country, the conference believes that improving grassroots organizations is an important part of the current work of the Youth League. In order to give play to the organizational role of the League, League committees at all levels must go deep into the lower levels, face the branches, face the masses; vigorously cultivate leading cores and backbones, so that they can work independently. The conference also called on League committees at all levels, including all cadres of the Youth League, to contact one or more branches in the future. Regarding the issue of leadership, the conference believed that it is necessary to change the past all-encompassing leadership method, which requires certain conditions and a process of transformation. Therefore, at present, the League's regular work and systematic leadership must be gradually established, and it should not be too hasty. First of all, in terms of leadership ideology, it is necessary to recognize that the central work of the government and the Party is the central work of the League, and the work of the League should be subject to the needs of the entire work. League committees at all levels should take the initiative to study the central work of the Party, formulate plans, and submit them to the corresponding Party committee for review and approval. League committees and branch committees at all levels should implement division of labor and responsibility, collective leadership, and regularly maintain certain cadres to handle the work of the League. When the higher authorities issue instructions, they should not only explain what to do, but also explain why to do it and how to do it. After the work is deployed, the leadership should pay attention to the progress of the work, adopt typical demonstrations, and combine points and areas, using radio, newspapers, League publications, and meetings to introduce typical examples and spread experience, so that the work can be continuously improved, advanced, and developed.

　　青年团中央召开全国农村青年工作会议
    确定不同地区的青年工作方针
    并决定加强对团员的政治思想教育、健全基层组织
    【新华社九日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会召开的青年团全国农村青年工作会议，确定了青年团在老区农村和新区农村，以及在少数民族地区的不同的任务。会议决定：老区农村青年团的任务是实现农业增产计划和展开文化教育工作；新区农村青年团的任务是发动农村青年参加土地改革和减租、反恶霸的斗争；至于在少数民族地区开展青年工作和进行建团，则要采取稳重谨慎的方针。
    这个会议总共开了十一天，于八月三十一日闭幕。会议听取了青年团中央副书记蒋南翔在开幕典礼上的讲话，团中央青农部部长许世平关于老区和新区农村青年工作的报告，以及团中央书记冯文彬的结论。会议并曾邀请中央人民政府农业部长李书城作了目前农业生产的报告；中央财经委员会副主任薄一波报告了合作社的问题，郭沫若报告了开展农村中和平签名运动的问题。中共中央政策研究室副主任廖鲁言作了土改政策与划分阶级成份的报告。会议主要解决了以下的问题：
    在老区农村的任务：实现农业增产计划开展文化教育工作
    在老区农村，青年团的首要任务是在党的领导下，为完成人民政府和党的农业增产计划而斗争。青年团在生产运动中，要团结广大青年和成年人一道，在组织起来、提高技术、解决供销、农业和副业相结合四项任务中，发挥团的积极作用。组织生产互助必须坚持自愿和等价交换的原则，一般不应脱离家庭单独组织青年互助组、组织起来要与提高技术、推广新农具相结合，进一步提高与巩固互助组。同时也要积极地组织与领导小型的、短期的、临时的互助组。青年团组织要领导和帮助团员和青年，通过参观、座谈会、技术研究小组、报刊去学习农业生产技术，团的干部首先要学习技术，把技术带下乡去，领导团员做出成绩。为提高广大青年的劳动热忱和生产成绩，青年团要动员青年通过群众性的比耕作、比技术、比庄稼等方式，开展农业生产竞赛。并奖励与推广青年的大小成绩与创造，培养发现各式各样的青年劳动模范，树立榜样。
    其次，老区农村青年团应在不误生产，为生产服务的原则下，努力开展农村的文化教育工作，首先应协助政府办好民校，开展农村的识字运动，所有农村中的青年团员特别是团员中的干部，应该积极参加文化学习，争取在两年之内，首先消灭团内干部中的文盲和半文盲，这是改进团在农村工作的一个重要关键。
    另外，青年的切身问题，如婚姻问题及文化娱乐活动等，青年团也应关心并帮助解决。
    在新区农村的任务：全力发动青年农民参加土改减租反霸
    青年团在新区农村的主要任务是全力发动青年农民与全体农民一道，参加土地改革和减租、反霸的斗争。新区建团方针应是根据主、客观条件，有领导、有步骤地、稳步地建立团的组织。团委首先要准备与训练团的干部。在建团步骤上，首先要发动青年农民参加农会、民兵，和全体农民一道进行斗争，再将运动中涌现出来的积极分子，经过必要的教育，在自觉自愿的基础上吸收入团，然后利用团的组织力量，进一步推动运动向前发展。
    对在少数民族地区开展年青工作与进行建团，会议认为必须采取稳重谨慎的方针，不能急躁，不能机械地搬用汉人地区的工作方式和经验。首先要培养训练少数民族干部，增进各民族青年的友爱团结。然后随着当地少数民族青年的要求和觉悟程度，慎重地、逐步地由城镇到农村开展青年工作。具备建团条件后，再由点到面地进行建团。
    无论新区老区，青年团均要发挥在农村工作中和青年中的作用，均应加强对团员的政治思想教育，有计划地讲授时事政策，团的基本知识和马列主义、毛泽东思想的基本知识。并应结合实际的斗争和工作去进行这种思想政治教育。
    根据全国团的情况，会议认为，健全基层组织是目前青年团工作的重要一环。为了发挥团的组织作用，各级团委必须深入下层，面向支部，面向群众；大力培养领导核心与骨干，使他们能独立地工作。会议并号召各级团委包括所有青年团的干部，今后要联系一个或一个以上的支部。关于领导问题，会议认为，要转变过去一揽子的领导方法，需要具备一定的条件与转变过程。因此，目前须逐步建立团的经常工作与系统领导，不应过急。这首先，在领导思想上要认清政府和党的中心工作就是团的中心工作，团的工作应服从整个工作的需要。各级团委应主动研究党的中心工作，制定计划，提交同级党委审查通过。各级团委与支委要实行分工负责，集体领导，并经常保持一定干部处理团的工作。上级发布指示，不只要说明做什么，而且要说明为什么做与如何做。工作布置下去以后，领导上要注意工作的进展，采取典型示范，点面结合的方法，利用广播、报纸、团刊、会议介绍典型，传播经验，使工作不断提高、前进与发展。
