Shanghai Public Transportation Company's Entire Staff
    Implements Responsibility System for Repairing Buses and Ferries
    Over One Hundred Wooden Buses to be Repaired Before and After National Day
    [This newspaper's report] According to Shanghai's Liberation Daily and News Daily: The employees of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on the company's production achievements over the past year in overcoming the blockade and bombing by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. They also guaranteed to make the October production grand competition a gift for the first National Day. The company's two maintenance depots have successively repaired 95 wooden buses and 48 aluminum buses (some of which were contracted to private factories for repair). It is planned to complete the repair of all 130 wooden buses around National Day. Due to the insufficient number of aluminum buses, they will be repaired in batches. After the ferry workers of the Dongmen Road river-crossing ferry line implemented the responsibility system, other lines are striving to implement the responsibility system as soon as possible, working hard to ensure the company breaks even in order to celebrate National Day. The repair shop even completed the overhaul of Ferry No. 3 ten days ahead of schedule and has now joined the Gaoqiao line. The letter from the company's entire staff to Chairman Mao is as follows:
Dear Chairman Mao:
    The People's Republic of China has been established for one year. Under your wise leadership, our motherland is growing stronger day by day. We have never been able to breathe so freely!
    Shanghai in East China is at the forefront of the anti-blockade. Under the enemy's blockade, our public transportation company has encountered unprecedented difficulties in the past year due to the lack of gasoline and raw materials, resulting in increased costs. In addition, the bandit planes destroyed our electricity, causing industrial and commercial depression and worker unemployment. As a result, operating income has decreased, making it difficult for our company to even maintain itself temporarily, and we have to rely on government subsidies to survive. The imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang want to use this vicious means to strangle us! But we have not yielded, nor have we been intimidated by the enemy. In the past year, our entire staff of more than 2,200 workers has worked together, resolutely fighting against difficulties. According to the central government's unified financial decision, we officially established the company, abandoned the government's monthly subsidies, and replaced the old shift system with new production systems such as the responsibility system and the contracted route system. We scientifically improved labor organization, created white coal substitute combustion furnaces to replace gasoline, and enthusiastically launched a merit competition. Not only did we maintain production, but we also basically achieved break-even and self-sufficiency, establishing the foundation for corporatization. Now we are telling our beloved Chairman Mao about our achievements over the past year:
    (1) Gasoline mileage has increased from an average of 6.5 kilometers per gallon to more than 13.2 kilometers, an increase of more than 100% in fuel saving compared to the original.
    (2) Fuel expenditure was originally 151,000 gallons of oil per month (monthly mileage of 980,000 kilometers, calculated at 6.5 kilometers per gallon), amounting to 6.119 billion yuan. Now, after using white coal, the monthly expenditure is 841 million yuan, and the fuel cost ratio is 7.2704 to 1.
    (3) Monthly operating income has increased from 537,704 real units to 819,199 units.
    (4) The cost per vehicle kilometer has decreased from 1.7632 real units to 0.7719 units.
Chairman Mao! We assure you that we will definitely fight in our posts to strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation, and greet the first National Day with the October production grand competition!
      Respectfully submitted by all workers of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company

    【本报讯】据上海解放日报、新闻日报讯：上海市公共交通公司职工，写信给毛主席，报告该公司一年来在战胜蒋匪帮的封锁、轰炸中的生产成绩，并保证以十月份的生产大竞赛做为第一个国庆日的献礼，该公司的两个保养场，已先后修好木质公共汽车九十五辆，铝质公共汽车四十八辆（其中一部分为包给私营厂家修理）。准备在国庆前后把全部一百三十辆木质车修竣。铝质车因车辆不足，将分批抽调修理。市轮渡职工自东门路对江轮渡线实行负责制后，其他各线均在争取及早实行负责制，为公司努力保本以庆祝国庆。修理厂更提前十天完成了三号轮渡的大修工作，目前且已加入高桥线行驶。该公司全体职工写给毛主席的信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    中华人民共和国成立一周年了，在你的英明领导下，我们的祖国日渐壮大起来，我们从来没有像这样的可以自由呼吸！
    华东区的上海是站在反封锁的最前哨，在敌人的封锁下，一年来我们公共交通公司遭遇到汽油及原、材料缺乏的空前困难，致使成本增高，加上了匪机的摧毁我们的电力，造成了工商业的不景气与工人失业，因此营业收入降低，使我们的企业暂时维持都很困难，不得不赖政府的贴补过日子，帝国主义和蒋匪帮就想用这种毒辣的手段来扼杀我们的！但是我们没有屈服，亦没有被敌人吓倒，一年来我们全体二千二百余工人同心协力，坚决地与困难作斗争，根据中央财经统一的决定，我们正式的成立了公司，放弃了政府逐月的贴补，以新的生产制度——负责制和包线制等代替了旧的轮班制，科学的改善劳动组织，创造了白煤代燃炉，代替了汽油，高度热烈的情绪发动了立功竞赛，不但维持了生产，而且基本上达到保本自给，建立了企业化的基础，现在把我们一年来的成绩告诉给亲爱的毛主席：
    （一）汽油每加仑行驶从六·五公里平均提高到一三·二公里以上，节油量较原来提高了一○○％以上。
    （二）燃料支出原来每月耗油量十五万一千加仑（每月行驶九十八万公里按每加仑六·五公里计）达六十一亿一千九百万元，现在用白煤后，每月支出八亿四千一百万元，燃料成本比例为七·二七○四比一。
    （三）每月营业收入从折实单位五三七、七○四单位提高到八一九、一九九单位。
    （四）每车公里成本从折实单位一·七六三二单位减到○·七七一九单位。
    毛主席！我们向你保证，我们一定在我们的岗位上为争取国家财政经济状况的根本好转而斗争，并以十月份的生产大竞赛来迎接第一个国庆日！
      上海市公共交通公司全体工人敬上
