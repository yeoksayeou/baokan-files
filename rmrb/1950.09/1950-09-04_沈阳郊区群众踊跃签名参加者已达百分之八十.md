[Report]

　　(By our newspaper) Since the end of May, the 12 districts and 462 administrative villages in the suburbs of Shenyang have universally launched the Peace Signature Campaign. Each district has established a branch of the "Committee for the Peace Signature Campaign," composed of responsible cadres from the Party, government, and youth organizations, union chairmen, representatives from middle and primary schools, directors of cultural centers and women's federations, presidents of industry and commerce associations, people's representatives, and model workers. Several propaganda teams, organized by government cadres, school teachers and students, and village cadres, have penetrated the masses to carry out propaganda and set up signature stations to collect peace signatures. In addition to using general propaganda tools such as Yangko teams, radio broadcasts, blackboards, and wall newspapers, propaganda methods included holding resident group meetings and door-to-door visits to break through the old ways of thinking of the villagers, all of which have achieved considerable results. For example, after propaganda and education in Dazhu Third Village in Shaling District, the masses understood the significance of the Peace Signature Campaign. Of the 1,670 people in the village, more than 1,500 consciously signed their names within two hours. Sujiatun District and Shenjingzi District have achieved relatively good results. Some other districts, such as Guanlibao, Zhujiatun, and Cailuobao, were affected by the fact that most of the cadres were participating in training classes at the Agricultural Commission at the time, which affected the progress of the work. According to statistics on June 15, out of the total suburban population of 560,000, only 217,670 people had signed their names. By the end of June, the number of signatories had increased to 348,810.

    In order to continue to vigorously expand the Peace Signature Campaign, publicity has been combined with the "August 1st" and "August 15th" commemorations since this month, and the number of signatories in each district has increased significantly. As of August 25, according to incomplete statistics, the total number of signatories in each district to the peace declaration has reached 390,264, accounting for more than 70% of the total suburban population. Adding the numbers from several districts not included in the calculation, the total will approach or exceed 80%. Now, each district is striving to get more than 80% of the masses to participate in the Peace Signature Campaign.

　　沈阳郊区群众踊跃签名参加者已达百分之八十
    【本报讯】沈阳市市郊十二个区四百六十二个行政村自五月底普遍开始进行和平签名运动，每区分别成立了“保卫和平签名运动委员会”分会，由党政团的负责干部、工会主席及中学完小代表、文化馆及妇联会主任、工商会会长、人民代表、劳动模范等组成，并由机关干部、学校师生及村干等组织若干宣传小组，深入群众进行宣传，设立签名处征集和平签名。宣传方式除利用秧歌队、广播、黑板报、墙报等一般宣传工具外，并采取了召开居民小组会和串门访问等办法，打通老乡们的思想，都收到相当效果。例如沙岭区大祝三村群众经过宣传教育后，认识了和平签名运动的意义，全村人口一千六百七十名，两个钟头内有一千五百多人自觉地签了名。苏家屯区、深井子区的成绩都是比较好的，另外一些如官立堡、祝家屯、财落堡等区则因为当时干部大部分参加农委训练班学习，影响了工作的进行。据六月十五日统计，整个郊区五十六万人口中，仅有二十一万七千六百七十人签了名。到六月底，签名者数目已增至三十四万八千八百一十名。
    为继续大力扩展和平签名运动，本月起又结合着“八一”、“八一五”纪念进行宣传，各区签名人数纷纷增加，截至八月二十五日止，据不完全统计，各区在和平宣言上签名者总数已达三十九万零二百六十四名，占市郊总人口的百分之七十强。加上未计算在内的几个区的数目，将接近百分之八十或超过此数。现在各区正为争取超过百分之八十的群众参加和平签名而努力。
