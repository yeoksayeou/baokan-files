　　Broad Masses of Workers in Beijing
    Compete in Production to Welcome National Day
    [Report from this newspaper] Many factory workers in Beijing have launched production competitions, taking practical actions to welcome the first National Day anniversary.
  General Machinery Factory
    The production competition movement among workers at the Beijing General Machinery Factory has been widely launched before National Day. Since the factory received the tasks of producing "air compressors," "air storage tanks," and "water cranes" in September, the normal production competition has been made possible. After research and deliberation by the trade union, the trade union groups were adjusted, the trade union leadership was strengthened, and the workshop organization and administrative reward and punishment methods were established. Since the start of the competition, the workers' production enthusiasm has greatly increased, and various departments have also closely cooperated. For example, in order to support the competition of the machine workshop, the forging department, which used to make one bent shaft in three days, now completes it in two days; the foundry department has established a nine-person technical research association to improve operating methods, which has reduced the scrap rate from 15% last month to about 10%.
  Machine Second Branch Factory
    The Beijing Machine Second Branch Factory has launched a rationalization competition movement. All workers and staff members of the factory were involved in the competition upsurge, and challenge letters and response letters were posted all over the walls. Because everyone used their brains and came up with ideas, various productions have been improved. For example, before the rationalization proposal competition started for three days (September 6, 7, and 8), the average scrap rate of water wheel castings was: frame 16.6%, large gear 26.5%, small gear 40.7%, chain wheel 43.3%, and lever seat 15.6%. However, in the three days after the launch of the movement (September 9, 10, and 11), the quality of water wheel castings was unprecedentedly improved, and the scrap rate was greatly reduced. For example, the frame dropped to 8.3%, the large gear dropped to 13.7%, the small gear dropped to 19.1%, the chain wheel dropped to 11.1%, and the lever seat dropped to 7.9%. In addition, a total of 127 suggestions were received on production management, of which 34 were related to safety guarantees. At present, the competition movement is being carried out enthusiastically in the factory.
  Telecommunications Bureau
    More than 3,000 telecommunications workers in the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, in order to welcome the first anniversary of National Day, also under the call of the district committee, since mid-August, have successively set off a competition upsurge. The competition slogan is "Reduce user complaints and eliminate errors." Each unit also put forward its own slogan according to its specific situation. For example, Dongying Telegraph Office, since it put forward the competition slogan of "Eliminating accidents and serious errors, reducing minor errors" in mid-August, has not had any serious errors since September, and only two minor errors have occurred. The fourth and fifth telephone sub-bureaus also launched a comprehensive competition on September 1. Among them, the fifth sub-bureau's monthly number of obstacles dropped from almost 5% to only 1.44% of the total number of machines reported by users from September 1 to 15; the troubleshooting team repaired 497 telephone sets in 15 days. Fifteen units under the business section have also launched the "Welcome National Day, improve production efficiency" movement; among them, the debt collection team originally planned to recover 85% of all telephone bills in 11 days, but in fact, by the morning of the seventh day, 100% of all telephone bills had been recovered, and users responded well.
  Clothing Factory
    The Beijing Clothing Factory, just when it was rushing to make winter clothes, started as early as August 24 to carry out propaganda to strive to be a model in rushing to make winter clothes, and prepared to launch a production competition to welcome the Labor Model Conference and National Day. At present, the factory has launched production competitions between groups and classes, challenging each other, and everyone is in high spirits. The eighth class Zhang Junshan group recently made military cadres' clothing, and the output has greatly increased. The standard output is four sets, but in the past three days, it has reached eight and a half sets.
  Private Oriental Paper Mill
    The private Oriental Paper Mill, since the two labor-management consultation meetings convened under the leadership of the Third District Trade Union in late July, the workers' production enthusiasm has been greatly improved. In order to welcome National Day, they have repeatedly and actively initiated the movement to sacrifice Sunday rest to increase production. Since its implementation, not only has it guaranteed the completion of a large number of fixed tasks, but also the quality of the finished products is quite good.
    In addition, the sewing production group in the Fifth District of Beijing launched a 20-day red flag competition movement to welcome National Day.

　　京市广大职工
    迎接国庆竞赛生产
    【本报讯】京市不少工厂职工展开生产竞赛，以实际行动迎接第一个国庆纪念日。
  机械总厂
    北京机械总厂职工生产竞赛运动，在国庆节前普遍展开。该厂自九月份接到要生产“空气压缩机”“贮气罐”“水鹤”诸任务后，已使正常的生产竞赛获得了开展的可能，经工会等研究酝酿，调整了工会小组，加强工会领导，成立了车间组织和行政议定奖惩办法等。自竞赛开始后，工人生产情绪大大提高，各部门亦密切配合。如锻工部为支援机工部的竞赛，以前三天打一弯轴，现在两天就完成了；铸工部成立了九人技术研究会，改进操作方法，已使废品由上月百分之十五降到百分之十左右。
  机器第二分厂
    北京机器第二分厂展开了合理化竞赛运动。全厂工友和职员都卷入了竞赛热潮，挑战书、应战书贴满了墙壁。由于大家开动脑筋，想办法，使各项生产都有了改进。如在合理化建议竞赛开始之前三天（九月六、七、八日）水车铸件的平均报废率是这样：机架百分之十六点六，大牙轮百分之二十六点五，小牙轮百分之四十点七，练子轮百分之四十三点三，杠座百分之十五点六。但在运动开展以后的三天（九、十、十一日）水车的铸件质量空前提高，报废率大为减少。如机架降为百分之八点三，大牙轮降为百分之十三点七，小牙轮百分之十九点一，练子轮百分之十一点一，杠座百分之七点九。另外在生产管理方面的建议，共收到一百二十七条，其中属于安全保障者即达三十四条。目前竞赛运动在该厂正热烈开展中。
  电信局
    北京电信局三千余电信职工，为迎接第一周年国庆，亦在区委员会的号召下，自八月中旬起即先后掀起了竞赛热潮，竞赛口号是“减少用户申告障碍，消灭差错”。各单位并根据具体情况提出自己单位的口号。如东营报房，自八月中旬提出“消灭事故及严重差错，减少小差错”的竞赛口号后，从九月份起至今未出过严重差错，小差错亦仅出过两次。电话四分局和五分局也于九月一日展开了全面性的竞赛，其中五分局每月的障碍数字从差不多百分之五，降到九月一日至十五日间的用户申告障碍数仅有全部机械数的百分之一点四四；查修班在十五天内，就整修了四百九十七户话机。营业科所属的单位，亦已有十五个展开“迎接国庆日，提高生产效率”的运动；其中清欠组原订十一天收回全部电话费的百分之八十五，而实际到第七天早晨即把全部电话费百分之百的收回了，且用户反映良好。
  被服厂
    北京被服厂，正当赶制冬装之际，远在八月二十四日起即着手进行鼓动宣传在赶制冬装中争取做模范，准备以展开生产竞赛来迎接劳模大会与国庆日。目前全厂已展开了组与组、班与班的生产竞赛，互相提出挑战，大家情绪很高。八班张俊山小组，最近做军委干部服，产量大大上升，标准产量是四套，而最近三天却已达到八套半。
  私营东方制纸厂
    私营东方制纸厂，自七月下旬在三区工会领导下，召开了两次劳资协商会议以来，工人生产情绪大为提高，为了迎接国庆，曾一再主动发起牺牲星期日休息的运动，增加生产。实行以来，不但保证完成了大批定活，且所出成品质量亦相当好。
    此外，京市五区缝纫生产组，为迎接国庆，发动了进行二十天的红旗竞赛运动。
