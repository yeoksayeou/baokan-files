　　Guanghua Machinery Factory Discovers Lax Labor Discipline and Disconnected Work During Rectification
    Specific Measures for Establishing a Responsibility System Have Been Drafted
    [Our Dispatch] The rectification movement at the state-owned Guanghua Machinery Factory in Liaodong Province began in early August and is nearing completion at the end of August. From the summary and inspection work, the main problems currently existing in the Guanghua Machinery Factory are that a production responsibility system has not been established, mainly manifested in:
    (1) Disconnection of work between departments. The scope of responsibilities of the inspection section and the production management section is not clear enough. Many semi-finished products made by the production management section's workshops are assembled without inspection; sometimes the inspection section takes the semi-finished products for inspection without going through the workshop, causing the workshop to think the work has not been done and doing it again. The relationship between the supply and marketing section and the production management section and the planning section is also not close. The supply and marketing section often blindly purchases materials without referring to the planning section's "Raw Material Procurement Plan" or checking the inventory, resulting in duplicate purchases of some materials. The production management section often experiences work stoppages due to the untimely supply of materials by the supply and marketing section. On the other hand, the production management section does not know how many finished products the supply and marketing section produces each month, so it cannot conduct planned sales.
    (2) Lax labor discipline and serious loss of tools. Absenteeism is common in the factory, and the absenteeism rate is very high. For example, the highest attendance rate in July was only 86.6%. In the absenteeism rate over the past few months, absenteeism always accounts for more than half. The reason for the high absenteeism is that the factory does not have a clear leave system. Absenteeism is the same as taking leave. Workers think that taking leave is troublesome, so they are willful and absent from work. In addition, it is quite common for workers to talk and laugh during working hours, gather in groups of three or five to chat, and go to wash their hands and wait to get off work before the time is up.
    As for the loss of various appliances and items due to lax management, it happens every month. What is even more serious is that some things are lost so much that they don't even know the number (such as the loss of copper in the foundry). Some more important equipment such as copper tiles, ball bearing tiles, and magnetic steel knives have also been lost; the loss of tools such as adjustable wrenches, files, and taps cannot be counted at all.
    (3) The workshop lacks a fixed system, and accidents occur constantly. The workshop's "Mechanical and Electrical Maintenance System" and "Machine Person Responsible System" have not been established. For many months, only July had no mechanical and electrical accidents. When drawings arrive in the workshop, they are worked on without inspection. Some people even change the drawings without authorization, and after the change, they do not stamp to indicate responsibility. For example, in manufacturing nine seats for wood chippers, each weighing more than 1,500 pounds, eight were cast before it was discovered that the drawings were wrong, resulting in a loss of nearly 200 million yuan.
    (4) Production lacks careful planning. When doing external orders, it is often because it is estimated that the task cannot be completed on time, so it is blindly contracted to private iron factories without a plan, resulting in the phenomenon that the factory has no work to do. For example, the foundry only did four jobs in total in more than ten days in July. Until August, there were still many people who had no small jobs to do. Because some of the finished products made by private iron factories did not meet the specifications, a lot of work was wasted during assembly.
    Based on these problems that have been inspected, Guanghua Machinery Factory has determined several methods for transforming the work:
    First, enrich and improve the organizational structure and clarify the division of labor. In order to overcome the past phenomenon of non-connection between departments and mutual evasion of responsibility, it is determined to take the production management section as the main body and conduct a general division of labor and clarification of work responsibilities. Achieve "everyone has something to do, everything has someone to manage" and strengthen the connection between departments.
    Second, establish an inspection system, including a series of inspections from raw materials to finished products throughout the entire production process. The main purpose is to eliminate defective products. Inspection procedures, records, and inspection marks must be specific, clear, and easy for people to accept. The inspection system must clearly stipulate that: all work-in-process, semi-finished products, and finished products that have not been inspected are not considered to have completed the task. After the draft is drawn up, it must be discussed by all workers to put forward opinions, revisions and supplements, so that workers can consciously and willingly abide by the inspection system.
    Third, vigorously promote the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang group. Through this work, the problems that Guanghua Machinery Factory urgently needs to solve, such as reducing defective products and absenteeism rates, and establishing a responsibility system, will be gradually resolved.

　　光华机械厂整风中发现
    劳动纪律松弛工作脱节
    现已拟出建立责任制的具体办法
    【本报讯】辽东省营光华机械厂的整风运动，自八月初开始，八月末将近结束。从总结检查工作中，暴露出光华机械厂目前存在的主要问题是生产责任制没有建立起来，主要表现在：
    （一）各股间工作脱节。检查股和生产管理股的工作职责范围不够明确。生产管理股各车间作出来的半成品多是没有经过检查就装配上了；有时检查股又没有通过车间就把半成品拿去检查，致使车间以为活还没有做，又做了重份。供销股和生产管理股及计划股的关系也不密切。供销股常是盲目的不根据计划股的“原材料采购计划”来进行采购，也不查看库存材料，致有的材料买了重份。生产管理股因为供销股的材料供给不及时，常发生停工待料的现象。另一方面，生产管理股每个月出了多少成品供销股也不知道，不能作到有计划的推销。
    （二）劳动纪律松懈，丢失工具现象严重。该厂旷工现象普遍，欠勤率很高。如七月份出勤率最高，也仅达到百分之八十六点六。几个月以来的欠勤率中，旷工总是占一半以上。旷工多的原因，是因为该厂没有一个明确的请假制度，旷工和请假一样，工人认为请假麻烦，率性旷工。此外，工人在工作时间说笑打闹，三五成群聚在一处闲聊天，不到点就去洗手等着下班的现象也相当普遍。
    至于因各种器具物品管理不严，而发生丢失的现象每个月都有。更严重的是有的东西丢了多少连数目都不知道（如翻砂间的丢铜）。一些较为重要的器材如：铜瓦、滚珠瓦、磁钢刀等也都丢失过；工具类的东西如活搬子、错刀、丝椎等的丢失则根本不能计数。
    （三）车间无一定制度，事故不断发生。车间的“机电检修制”，“机器专人负责制”等没有建立起来。好多个月以来，仅仅七月份没有发生机电事故。图纸到了车间，不经检查，照着就干。甚至有人还擅自改动图纸，改完了也不盖章表示负责。如制造九个碎木机的座子，每个一千五百多斤，因图纸错了，铸了八个才发现，损失将近二亿元。
    （四）生产缺乏周密的计划。做外部的订货时，往往因为估计到期完不成任务就盲目无计划的包给私人铁工厂，致发生了本工厂没活干的现象。如：翻砂间在七月份十几天中一共只干四件活。直到八月份还有好多人没有小活干。因为有的私人铁工厂做的成品不合规格，在装配时又费了很多工。
    根据检查出来的这些问题，光华机械厂确定了几个改造工作的办法：
    第一、充实和健全组织机构，明确分工。为了克服过去各部间不相衔接以及互相推诿互不负责的现象，确定以生产管理股为主，普遍的进行一次分工及明确工作职责的工作。做到“人有事干，事有人管”，密切各股间的联系。
    第二、建立检查制度，包括从原材料开始到成品整个生产过程的一系列的检查，主要目的是消灭废品。检查手续、记录及检查的标志，必须具体明晰容易使人接受。检查制度上要明确规定出：凡是没有经过检查的在制品、半成品、成品不算完成任务。拟出草案后，须经全体工人讨论，提出意见，修正补充，使工人能自觉自愿的遵守检查制度。
    第三、全力推广马恒昌小组的先进生产经验。通过这一工作，以逐步解决光华机械厂目前急须解决的减少废品和欠勤率、建立责任制度等问题。
