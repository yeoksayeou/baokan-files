Tianjin Railway Factory's Entire Workforce Completes Annual Production Target Ahead of Schedule
[Our Tianjin Dispatch] (Correspondent Liu Lin reports): To welcome the first National Day, the entire workforce of the Tianjin Railway Factory of the Tianjin Railway Bureau has completed the annual production target on September 27th. The entire workforce wrote to Chairman Mao to report this good news. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
　　We, the entire workforce of the Tianjin Railway Factory of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, report to you with great excitement the production situation of completing the annual target in September, as a gift to celebrate the National Day. The Ministry of Railways assigned our factory the task of overhauling 1069.2 freight cars (converted to equivalent large repairs) this year. As of September 27th, we have completed 1072.3 cars, exceeding the target by 0.03%. Other tasks such as cast iron, cast copper, and forged iron have also exceeded the targets set by the Ministry. Increasing production and reducing costs, in car repair alone, we have saved 2.13 million catties of millet by the end of August. We have also implemented a strict inspection system, and various repair rates have generally decreased, and production quality has gradually improved. We have accepted the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and Northeast China. We have initially learned democratic management. Through production competitions, we have launched rationalization proposals and new record creation movements, further stimulating work enthusiasm and creativity. Most importantly, under your banner and the correct leadership of the Party, we have become masters of our own destiny, which is how we achieved such results. We recognize this as the beginning of progress. We are determined to continue our efforts to guarantee more complete and exceed the tasks given by the state. We wish you good health!
　　　　　　Respectfully, The Entire Workforce of the Tianjin Railway Factory of the Tianjin Railway Bureau
　　　　　　September 27th
