　　This is Indeed a "U.S. Problem"
　　Guo Moruo

　　I read a translated version of Simonov's "The Russian Question" three years ago, and it was indeed a good play with educational significance.

　　Its theme is naturally to oppose American imperialism, but it is by no means to oppose the American people. The conspiracy of American imperialists to provoke war has become a reality today. It is in fact "the enemy of one-quarter of the Soviet Union and the enemy of three-quarters of the American people." The author has boundless sympathy for the American people.

　　The protagonist, Smith, is a conscientious liberal. He refused to accept the anti-Soviet instructions from the newspaper owner and chief editor, McPherson, to go to the Soviet Union to spread rumors that the Russians were preparing to invade. As a result, he lost everything in his life and was "not tolerated by the likes of Hearst."

　　But he discovered "Lincoln's America," and he was "planning to start a new life."

　　Through Smith, we can understand: In today's America, how the general conscientious people are being persecuted; in today's America, the so-called freedom of liberals simply does not exist. To win true freedom, one can only "start a new life" and create "Lincoln's America" – that is, "the people's America," "the America of tomorrow."

　　This points out a path for the American people. Unfortunately, this fair play is banned from being performed in the United States. From this alone, we can see how the reactionary American rulers are deceiving the American people and are afraid of the awakening of the American people.

　　But we are fortunate. We can freely appreciate the performance of this play, allowing us to recognize what today's America is, and further distinguish between enemies and friends.

　　The unfree American people are equally worthy of sympathy. Therefore, our intensified opposition to American imperialist aggression is also supporting the American people and helping the creation of "Lincoln's America."

### 这倒是“美国问题”

　　这倒是“美国问题”
    郭沫若
    西蒙诺夫的《俄罗斯问题》，我在三年前读过译本，的确是一部富有教育意义的好剧本。
    它的主题自然是反对美国帝国主义，但决不是反对美国人民。美国帝国主义者阴谋挑拨战争，在今天已经成为事实。它事实上是“四分之一的苏联的敌人，四分之三的美国人民的敌人”。作者对于美国人民是抱有无限同情的。
    主人翁斯密司是有良心的一位自由主义者。他不肯接受报馆老板兼总主笔马菲尔逊的反苏指示，要他到苏联去从事造谣，说俄罗斯人准备侵略，因而失掉了生活上的一切，“不见容于赫斯脱等一班人的美国”。
    但他却发现了“林肯的美国”，他“正打算开始新的生活”。
    通过斯密司，我们可以了解：在今天的美国，一般有良心的人们是受着怎样的迫害；在今天的美国，所谓自由主义者的自由是根本不存在的。要想争取真正的自由，那只好“开始新的生活”，创造“林肯的美国”——也就是“人民的美国”，“明天的美国”。
    这为美国人民指示出了一条路。可惜这个公正的剧本在美国是禁止上演的。单只这一点，我们便可以看出，反动的美国统治者是怎样蒙蔽着美国人民，害怕美国人民的觉悟了。
    但我们是幸福的。我们能够自由地欣赏这个剧本的上演，让我们认识什么是今天的美国，而更进一步分清敌友。
    不自由的美国人民同样是值得同情。因而我们的加紧反对美帝国主义侵略也就是支援了美国人民，帮助了“林肯的美国”的创造。
