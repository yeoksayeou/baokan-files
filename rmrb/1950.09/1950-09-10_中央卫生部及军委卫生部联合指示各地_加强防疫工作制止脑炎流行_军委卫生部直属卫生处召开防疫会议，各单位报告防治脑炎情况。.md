	Strengthen Epidemic Prevention Work and Stop the Spread of Encephalitis
	The General Logistics Department's Directly Subordinate Health Department Holds an Epidemic Prevention Meeting, and Various Units Report on the Situation of Encephalitis Prevention and Treatment.
	[This Newspaper's News] July, August, and September are the epidemic period for epidemic encephalitis. The situation in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places once tended to be serious in August. Thanks to the active efforts of the health departments of local people's governments, the situation began to improve by the end of August. According to incomplete investigations in various places: As of the 7th of this month in Beijing, a total of 310 patients and suspected patients have been discovered, with 102 deaths. From August 2nd to 22nd in Tianjin, 105 patients were discovered, with 27 deaths. In Baoding, Hebei, 5 patients were discovered, with 2 deaths. Nanjing reported 15 cases, Wuxi reported 7 cases, and Chengdu reported 3 cases. In order to stop the spread of the disease, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Health Department of the Military Commission of the Central People's Government jointly issued instructions on preventing epidemic encephalitis on the 1st of this month to the health bureaus and military region health departments of Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, Beijing, Tianjin, and other provinces and cities, the health departments of the East China and Southwest Military and Political Committees, and the health bureaus of Nanjing, Wuxi, Chengdu, and other cities. The instructions require all regions to strengthen epidemic reporting, provide free isolation and treatment for patients, and mobilize the masses to carry out mosquito eradication work to stop the continued spread of encephalitis.
	[This Newspaper's News] In order to respond to the call of the Central and Military Commission Health Departments on preventing epidemic encephalitis, the Directly Subordinate Health Department of the Military Commission Health Department held an epidemic prevention meeting on the 4th. Representatives from more than 30 units, including central and military directly subordinate organs, troops, and schools, attended the meeting, and responsible comrades from the Central and Military Commission Health Departments were invited to participate. Various units reported on the epidemic prevention work of their respective organs: Most units had completed the arrangements for the prevention of epidemic encephalitis in late spring and early summer, and had planned and systematically carried out work such as eliminating mosquitoes and flies and improving environmental sanitation, which had achieved great results. According to investigations by four units, there were a total of 42 encephalitis patients in 1949 and 11 encephalitis patients in 1950 (one of whom was a suspected patient). The above figures show that as long as we organize and everyone takes action to prevent it, epidemic encephalitis is not difficult to eradicate.
	At the meeting, the epidemic prevention team of the Directly Subordinate Health Department reported on the epidemic prevention work carried out in 25 central and military directly subordinate units in the past two months, explaining that to do a good job in epidemic prevention, it is necessary to go deep into various units, discover problems in a timely manner, and solve problems. It is necessary to cooperate with the administrative departments of various organs and troops and mobilize the masses to take concerted action, so as to prevent the spread of epidemic encephalitis and other infectious diseases in a timely manner.
	Finally, Xie Hua, director of the Directly Subordinate Health Department, pointed out that the encephalitis epidemic has not completely stopped recently. According to the investigation by the Municipal Public Health Bureau, 27 encephalitis patients occurred from the 1st to the 4th of this month. Therefore, the focus of the department's epidemic prevention work this month is still on the prevention and treatment of epidemic encephalitis. According to experts, the encephalitis epidemic will stop by the end of September. Therefore, all units should seize the opportunity to further take effective epidemic prevention measures and establish a strict epidemic reporting system to prevent the continued spread of encephalitis.

　　中央卫生部及军委卫生部联合指示各地
    加强防疫工作制止脑炎流行
    军委卫生部直属卫生处召开防疫会议，各单位报告防治脑炎情况。
    【本报讯】七、八、九三个月为流行性脑炎流行期间，北京、天津等地八月间曾一度趋于严重，由于各地人民政府卫生部门的积极努力，至八月底情形已开始好转。根据各地不完全的调查：北京市截至本月七日止，发现患者及疑似患者共三百一十人，死亡一百零二人。天津市自八月二日至二十二日发现患者一百零五人，死亡二十七人。河北保定发现患者五人，死亡二人。南京市曾报告十五例，无锡市报告七例，成都市报告三例。中央人民政府卫生部及中央人民政府军事委员会卫生部为制止该病蔓延，特于本月一日联合向河北、山西、平原、察哈尔、北京、天津等省市卫生局及军区卫生部，华东、西南两军政委员会卫生部，南京、无锡、成都等市卫生局等发出关于防止流行性脑炎的指示，指示各地除加强疫情报告，对患者免费隔离治疗外，必须发动群众进行灭蚊工作，以制止脑炎的继续流行。
    【本报讯】军委卫生部直属卫生处为了响应中央及军委卫生部关于防止流行性脑炎的号召，特于四日召开防疫会议。到会者有中央及军委直属机关、部队、学校等三十余个单位代表，并邀请中央及军委卫生部负责同志参加。由各单位汇报本机关防疫工作情况：大部分单位对于预防流行性脑炎的工作，在春末夏初即已布置完竣，并有计划有步骤的进行了消灭蚊蝇、改善环境卫生等工作，收效很大。根据四个单位的调查，一九四九年脑炎患者共四十二人，一九五○年脑炎患者十一人（其中一人为疑似患者）。以上数字说明：只要我们组织起来，大家动手进行预防，流行性脑炎是不难扑灭的。
    会议上直属卫生处防疫队报告了两个月来赴中央及军委直属二十五个单位进行防疫工作的情况，说明要做好防疫工作，必须深入各单位，及时发现问题，解决问题。必须与各机关、部队行政上配合，动员群众一致行动，这样才能及时防止流行性脑炎及其他传染病的流行。
    最后直属卫生处谢华处长指出：近来脑炎流行仍未完全停止，据市公共卫生局调查，本月一日至四日曾发生脑炎患者二十七人。因此该处本月份防疫工作仍以防治流行性脑炎为中心。据专家谈，九月底脑炎流行就会停止。因此各单位应抓紧时机，进一步采取有效的防疫措施，建立严格的疫情报告制度，以防止脑炎的继续流行。
