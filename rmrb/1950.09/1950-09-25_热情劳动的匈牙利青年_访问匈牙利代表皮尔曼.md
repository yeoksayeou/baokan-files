The nine million three hundred thousand people of Hungary are witnesses to the terrible destruction of the Second World War. Forty-two point two percent of the nation's property was destroyed by the war, and nearly six hundred thousand people lost their lives in the war. Therefore, the people of Hungary particularly hate wars of aggression, and they firmly stand on the side of the camp of peace and democracy. The entire nation, especially the youth, are working day and night to produce, to train themselves to be a more powerful force on the front line of the struggle for world peace. These situations were further confirmed in the conversation with Pirman, the representative of the Hungarian Working Youth League.

How do Hungarian youth gloriously shoulder the great task of rebuilding their motherland? More than five years after the liberation by the Soviet Red Army, the Hungarian people have victoriously completed the "Three-Year Plan" formulated to restore the economy ahead of schedule. In January of this year, they quickly started a new Five-Year Plan. The new Five-Year Plan is to transform an agricultural country into an industrialized country.

Under the leadership of the Workers' Party, the young Hungarian workers are enthusiastically launching a production competition movement. To celebrate the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin, the young workers initiated a production competition to "Commemorate Comrade Stalin's 70th Birthday," which played a significant role in production. For example, young dockworkers Edi Horvath and Gurdan Gok both completed forty times their assigned tasks in the competition. The young workers put forward the slogan: "Engaging in production competition is working in Comrade Stalin's position." Because the workers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm, the three-year plan was completed in two and a half years.

This year, Hungary's production competition is constantly improving in both method and quality. The workers are striving to turn the production competition into a regular movement. In the past, competitions were launched alongside certain festivals. Recently, a competition was held to commemorate the Hungarian Youth League Congress, with 120,000 young workers participating. They proposed to strive for each person to set a long-term production plan for one or two years. In addition, they are also preparing to establish a large number of youth production teams and "youth enterprises."

Comrade Pirman nodded and smiled: We have already experimented with so-called "youth enterprises." This means letting the youth be the masters of the entire enterprise and the staff of various departments. One sewing factory, which is not small in scale, has already been established, and all the work is done by young people. The advantage of "youth enterprises" is that they can increase the sense of responsibility of young workers. Glorious tasks encourage work enthusiasm, and young workers believe that completing tasks is the supreme honor of everyone.

In order to better carry out construction work, the Hungarian people, like other new democratic countries, are constantly learning from the great international friend, the Soviet Union. Outstanding Soviet Stakhanovite workers often visit Hungarian factories to show everyone how to use new experiences. Hungarian workers enthusiastically promote the Soviet Union's construction experience in various fields through lectures and pamphlets, so that production technology is constantly improved.

Hungarian young farmers are also working hard to promote the production competition movement. In agriculture, there are both state-owned farms (or cooperative farms) and private agriculture. In state-owned farms, 14,190 young farmers participated in the grand competition commemorating the Youth Congress this year. Private farmers have also generally responded to the call. During the harvest season, the youth organize themselves and establish work teams to protect the harvest, to prevent sabotage by a small number of special agents who are hostile to people's democracy.

Speaking of the current situation of students, Pirman recalled the situation where children of workers and peasants could not receive education during the reactionary Horthy rule. He said: In the past, the children of workers and peasants had no opportunity to study at all. The tuition fee for one year of university was equivalent to five months' income for a worker. This resulted in the children of workers and peasants accounting for only 3.5% of the total number of students. "Culture" was monopolized by a small number of people, and the rulers wanted to forever ride on the heads of the working people.

After liberation, culture was finally returned to the people. In just a few years, the children of workers, peasants, and working intellectuals have accounted for an overwhelming majority of the total number of students.

Finally, he enthusiastically told the reporter: The friendship between Chinese and Hungarian youth can be concretely expressed in their meetings with each other. Hungarian youth have a deep and militant friendship with Chinese youth. When the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation went to Budapest last year to participate in the Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the Chinese representatives were all moved by the warm reception from the Hungarian youth brothers. Today he is also moved by the friendship of the Chinese brothers. He repeatedly stated: Internationalist friendship cannot be broken or dispersed. (Attached picture)

### 热情劳动的匈牙利青年——访问匈牙利代表皮尔曼

　　热情劳动的匈牙利青年
    ——访问匈牙利代表皮尔曼
    匈牙利九百三十万人民是第二次世界大战惨烈破坏的见证人。整个国家财产百分之四十二·二被战争给毁坏了，将近六十多万人在战争中失掉了生命。因此，匈牙利的人民是特别憎恨侵略战争的，他们坚决站在和平民主阵营这一边。全国人民，特别是青年正在日以继夜的努力生产，以锻炼自己成为争取世界和平阵线上更有力的一员。这些情况在匈牙利劳动青年联盟代表皮尔曼的谈话中，更进一步地得到了证明。
    匈牙利青年们怎样光荣地担负起重建祖国这一伟大的任务呢？在苏联红军解放五年多的匈牙利人民，已经胜利地提前完成了为恢复经济而制订的“三年计划”，今年一月间，他们又迅速地开始了新的五年计划。新五年计划是要把农业国家变成工业化的国家。
    匈牙利的青年工人们在工人党的领导下正火热地展开了生产竞赛运动。为了庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰，青工们发起了“纪念斯大林同志七十寿辰”的生产竞赛，竞赛在生产中起了很大的作用。例如青年码头工人艾迪·霍尔瓦特和古尔丹·戈克，在竞赛中都完成了四十倍的任务。青年工人们提出来：“搞生产竞赛是站在斯大林同志岗位上劳动”的口号。由于工人们发挥了高度的劳动热情，所以两年半就完成了三年的计划。
    今年匈牙利的生产竞赛无论在方法上和质量上都在不断地提高着。工人们正在努力把生产竞赛变成经常化的运动，在过去的竞赛都是伴随着一定的节日开展的。最近举行了一次纪念匈牙利青年联盟代表大会的竞赛，有十二万青年工人参加。他们提出要争取使每一个人都订出一年或两年的长期生产计划。此外还在准备大量成立青年生产队和“青年企业”。
    皮尔曼同志点着头含笑说：我们已经试验着有了所谓“青年企业”了。这就是让青年们作整个企业的主人和各部门的工作人员。已经成立的有一个规模不算小的缝纫工厂，全部工作都由青年来担任。“青年企业”的好处是可以提高青年工人的责任感。光荣的任务鼓舞着工作热情，青工们都认为完成任务是每一个人的无上荣誉。
    为了更好地开展建设工作，匈牙利人民也和其他新民主主义国家一样，正在不断地向伟大的国际友人苏联学习。常常有苏联杰出的工人斯达哈诺夫工作者到匈牙利工厂去参观，实地告诉大家怎样使用新的经验。匈牙利工人们通过演讲和小册子等热烈地推广苏联在各方面的建设经验，使生产技术不断地提高。
    匈牙利青年农民也在努力推行着生产竞赛运动。在农业中，有国营农场（或合作社农场）以及私有农业两种。在国营农场中，今年已有一万四千一百九十个青年农民参加了纪念青代大会的大竞赛。私有的农民也大体响应了号召。在迎接收割的季节，青年们就组织起来，成立保护收成的工作队，以防止少数与人民民主为敌的特务分子的破坏行为。谈到学生的现状，皮尔曼想起了在反动派霍尔弟统治时代工农子弟不能受教育的情形。他说：从前工农子弟根本没有学习的机会，大学生一年的学费相当于一个工人五个月的收入。这样就造成了工农子弟仅占学生总数百分之三·五的结果。“文化”被少数人独占着，统治者想永远骑在劳动人民的头上。
    解放以后，文化终又归还到人民手里来。几年的光景，工人、农民及劳动知识分子子弟已占学生总数中压倒的多数。
    最后他热情地告诉记者：中匈青年间的友情可以具体表现在彼此的会面中。匈牙利青年对中国青年有着深厚的战斗的友情。去年中国民主青年代表团赴匈京参加世界民主青年联盟第二次代表大会时，中国代表们都为匈牙利青年弟兄的热情招待而感动了，今天他也为中国弟兄们的友情所激动了。他一再表示：国际主义的友爱是打不断也冲不散的。（附图片）
