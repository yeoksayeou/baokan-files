　　Anshan Workers Actively Produce
    Improve Quality and Exceed Plans

    [Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 10th] Following the provocative incident involving American aggressor planes, Anshan city workers have been increasing production to strengthen the nation's power. Two trucks at the Anshan Airport that were damaged by American aircraft – one hit in 26 places, the other in 7, with some bullet holes as large as 3 inches in diameter – were repaired overnight by airport workers, and both trucks were back in operation the next morning. The entire airport staff also launched a work competition campaign, vowing to avenge their dead and injured brothers by doing more work.

    Workers at the Liaodong Tussah Silk Textile Factory were filled with indignation after the American planes wreaked havoc, and their production enthusiasm greatly increased. According to statistics from the factory's silk weaving workshop: In the past ten days, production has increased from the standard quota of 29.1 yards per person per day to 32.15 yards. Quality has also improved from the prescribed standard of 80% to 88.4%, with six workers reaching 100%.

    Workers at the state-owned Anshan Machine Factory switched from a two-shift to a three-shift system on the evening of August 27th. Working day and night, they finally completed and exceeded their August task of 61 vertical lathes ahead of schedule. Li Shouyi, the leader of the fifth mutual aid group in the factory's mechanical workshop, produced six gears in four hours on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, increasing work efficiency by more than double. He said, "The American devils killed our people, and we have a lump in our throats. Our workers must work harder to increase the strength of the country."

    In the past ten days, the quality and quantity of products from the state-owned Anshan Paper Mill have also significantly improved. Third-grade products have been eliminated, and output has increased by 4% compared to the ten days before August 27th.

    [Our Newspaper] Since American planes massacred our compatriots, all workers at the state-owned Anshan Paper Mill have been filled with indignation, unanimously believing that even if planes are overhead and bullets are landing nearby, it must not affect their production. On the contrary, they must turn their indignation into strength. The recent production enthusiasm of the workers has fully demonstrated their determination to respond to American imperialism with practical actions. The production volume for the ten days before the enemy plane strafing (before August 27th) was 100%, while for the ten days after August 27th it was 104%; in terms of quality, third-grade products were eliminated in the latter ten days, improving to 0.28%, and absenteeism decreased, with the absenteeism rate accounting for 4.63% of the total number of people in the first ten days, which was reduced to 3.75 in the latter ten days.

　　安东工人积极生产
    提高质量超额完成计划
    【新华社安东十日电】在美国侵略者飞机挑衅事件发生后，安东市工人纷纷增加生产，以增强国家力量。安东机场被美国飞机击坏的两辆卡车——一辆中弹二十六处，另一辆中弹七处，弹穴大者直径达三寸，经机场工人连夜抢修，两辆卡车于翌晨即照常开动。机场全体工人并发起了工作竞赛运动，要以多做工作来为死伤兄弟们复仇。
    辽东柞丝纺织厂工人，在美机肆虐后愤激万分，生产热情大为提高。据该厂织绸间统计：十日来产量已自每日每人平均二十九点一码的定额标准量，提高至三十二点一五码：质量也从规定标准百分之八十提高到百分之八十八点四，其中并有六名工人达到百分之百。
    国营安东机器厂工人们，在上月二十七日晚即将二班制改为三班制。日以继夜地工作，终于提前并超额完成了八月份六十一台立式旋床的任务。该厂机械工场第五互助组组长李守义在本月二日下午，以四小时的时间车出牙轮六个，提高工作效率一倍以上。他说：“美国鬼子打死咱们的人，咱心中老堵着一口气。咱们工人要加紧干活，增加国家的力量。”
    十天来，国营安东造纸厂产品的质量及数量亦均显著提高。产品中的三等品已消灭，产量则较八月二十七日前十天提高了百分之四。
    【本报讯】国营安东造纸厂，自美国飞机残杀我国的同胞后，全体工人愤恨万分，一致认为：虽飞机来在头上，子弹落在身旁，但决不能影响他们生产。相反地，他们要把愤恨变成力量。职工们最近的生产情绪已足证明以实际行动来回答美帝国主义的决心。在敌机来扫射前（八月二十七日前）十天的生产量为百分之一百，二十七日后十天为百分之一百○四强；质量方面，后十天已消灭了三等品，提高为百分之○·二八，欠勤率减少，前十天欠勤率占总人数百分之四·六三，后十天即减为三·七五。（萧田滋）
