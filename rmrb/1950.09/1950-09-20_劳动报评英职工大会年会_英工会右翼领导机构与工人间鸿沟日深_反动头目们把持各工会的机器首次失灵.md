Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 19th: The Labor Daily published an article by Isakov, commenting on the 82nd annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress held in Brighton earlier this month, stating: This meeting showed that the gulf between the right-wing reactionary leadership of British trade unions and the broad masses of workers has deepened, and the outdated machine controlled by reactionary bosses of various British trade union organizations has, for the first time, spun out of control.

During the meeting, the British ruling group mobilized all its forces in an attempt to force the conference to accept "restricting workers' demands" in order to further strengthen the exploitation of the working class and attack their living standards, forcing them to directly bear the heavy burden caused by the Labor government's arms expansion and war preparations under the orders of its American masters. However, despite the Labor government's Prime Minister Attlee's anti-Soviet speech fabricating a "war threat," the hysterical cries of American AFL fascists, and the rabid barking of the bourgeois press, the conspiracies of the Trades Union Congress bosses were resolutely countered. Despite their manipulation and oppression, the motion demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons still received strong support with 1,972,000 votes. At the meeting, representatives openly expressed their indignation at the reactionary leaders' anti-Soviet slanders and condemned the aggressive policies of the US-British imperialist bloc.

The conference rejected the General Council's report on wage restraint and passed a resolution demanding the abolition of the wage freeze and protesting against the government's acquiescence to the continuous rise in profits. This resolution caused panic among the British ruling class, and the Times, the stronghold of finance and industry, worried that workers' demands for increased wages might "threaten the future of the entire economy." Therefore, British capitalists and their Labor Party servants are trying to use various means to undermine the decisions already passed by the conference in order to maintain the original wage freeze policy.

Isakov emphatically pointed out in his conclusion that the lessons of Brighton prove that the propaganda of the imperialist aggressors in Britain has completely failed, that the British people despise the Labor Party's "guns before butter" policy, and that the workers need to liberate themselves from the evil cycle of the arms race and preparations for a new war. The class struggle in Britain is becoming increasingly acute.

    英工会右翼领导机构与工人间鸿沟日深  反动头目们把持各工会的机器首次失灵
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：劳动报刊载伊萨可夫专文，评论本月初在布来屯举行的英国职工大会八十二届年会称：本届会议显示：英国工会右翼反动领导机构与工人大众之间的鸿沟已日益加深，反动头目们把持英国各工会组织的陈旧机器第一次控制失灵。
    开会期间，英国的统治集团曾动员一切力量，企图强迫大会接受“限制工人要求”以进一步加强剥削工人阶级并进攻其生活水准的政策，迫使他们直接承受工党政府在美国主子吩咐下进行扩军备战而造成的沉重负担。然而，会上尽管有工党政府首相艾德礼的捏造“战争威胁”的反苏演说，美国劳联法西斯分子的歇斯的里的叫嚣以及资产阶级报纸的狂吠，职工大会头目们的阴谋仍然遭到坚决的打击。在他们的操纵和压迫之下，要求禁止原子武器的议案还是得到一百九十七万二千票的强力支持。在会上，代表们公开表示了对于反动领导分子反苏谰言的愤慨，并谴责美英帝国主义集团的侵略政策。
    大会拒绝了最高委员会限制工资的报告，并且通过决议，要求废除工资冻结，并抗议政府听任利润不断上升。这一决议引起英国统治阶级的惊恐，金融工业界的堡垒《泰晤士报》忧虑工人增加工资的要求可能“威胁整个经济的前途”。因此，英国资本家及其工党仆从正力图使用种种手段来破坏大会业已通过的决定，以便维持原有的冻结工资政策。
    伊萨可夫在结语中着重指出：布米屯的教训证明帝国主义侵略者在英国的宣传彻底失败，英国人民鄙弃工党“大炮重于牛油”的政策，工人们需要把自己从军备竞赛与准备新战争的邪恶圈子里解放出来。英国的阶级斗争正在日趋尖锐化。
