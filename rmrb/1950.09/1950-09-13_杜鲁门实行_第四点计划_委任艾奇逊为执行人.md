　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 11th: According to the U.S. Information Service in Washington, Truman issued an order on September 8th appointing Secretary of State Acheson as the executor of the so-called "Point Four Program," responsible for implementing this plan of economic plunder against underdeveloped regions in colonies and dependencies.
　　According to Truman's statement, in the initial stage of this program, the method of American "aid" will be to send American "experts" to the countries receiving "aid," and these countries will send "qualified trainees" to the United States for training. Through these "experts" and "training," the economies of so-called "backward areas" will be brought into line with American standards, thereby becoming economically dependent on and subordinate to the United States. When implementing this program, the participating countries will also provide local personnel and additional funding to assist in its implementation.
　　According to the recent bill passed by the U.S. Congress, the first year of activity funding for the "Point Four Program" will be $34.5 million, specifically for use by government departments and "experts" to carry out activities aimed at Americanizing the economic modes and production methods of so-called "backward areas," in order to create favorable conditions for American capitalists to invest in colonies and dump goods.

　　杜鲁门实行“第四点计划”  委任艾奇逊为执行人
    【新华社十一日讯】据美国新闻处华盛顿消息，杜鲁门于九月八日下令委任国务卿艾奇逊为所谓“第四点计划”的执行人，负责实施这一对殖民地和附属国落后地区进行经济掠夺的计划。
    按照杜鲁门在其声明中所说，在这个计划的初步阶段，美国“援助”的方法将是派遣美国“专家”到受“援”的国家去，并由这些国家把“合格的受训人员”送往美国受训，以便通过这种“专家”和“训练”，使所谓“落后地区”的经济合乎美国的规格，从而在经济上依赖和从属于美国。在实行此项计划时，参加此项计划的国家亦将供给本地人员与额外经费，以协助其推行。
    根据美国国会新近通过的法案，“第四点计划”的第一年活动经费将为三千四百五十万美元，专供政府各部门及“专家”等进行使所谓“落后地区”的经济方式和生产方法美国化的活动之用，以便为美国资本家创造殖民投资及倾销商品的有利条件。
