　　How I Wrote "The Russian Question"
    For the Performance of "The Russian Question" in China
    Simonov
    I wrote the play "The Russian Question" after traveling to Japan and the United States. During this trip, which lasted about nine months, I had the opportunity to observe the activities of individual American journalists and the American press as a whole in Japan and the United States. Naturally, even before this trip, I knew about the many indecent methods adopted by the vast majority of reactionary elements in the United States who own American newspapers. I knew that the vast majority of American newspaper editors and journalists were carrying out the instructions of their masters—the financial magnates—prepared to write any slanderous remarks about the Soviet Union, about people's democratic countries, about any progressive phenomena, and about any progressive people in any country in the world for money. But when I came into direct contact with the representatives of the American press, I saw the techniques of slander (if one can put it that way). I not only read their articles slandering the Soviet Union and all progressive people, but I also saw how they did it, how they wrote these articles, how they followed their bosses' commands to change their beliefs, or pretend to change them, how they stirred up trouble, and how easily they confused right and wrong.

    But alongside these mostly shameless people who sold themselves to the American masters—the imperialists—there was a group of honest American journalists. They were not many, but they existed. Unfortunately, there were too few newspapers that could publish their articles, almost none. And even if such newspapers existed, they were printed in very few copies, and the broad American readership could not read them. But such journalists did exist after all. Sometimes they could occasionally appear in major American newspapers. They were able to do so because at that time, the political situation, for some reason, forced the owners of these newspapers to change their appearance, occasionally using the mouths of some journalists to express some somewhat progressive remarks. But once the political situation changed, the necessity for such temporary concealment by the American big newspaper owners disappeared, and they immediately forced every journalist under their control not to write what he had personally witnessed, but to write what was beneficial to them—the reactionaries. If a person who writes articles in the newspaper and whose conscience has not yet been extinguished protests and refuses to sell his pen, unwilling to carry out the reactionary will of his masters, then he is ruthlessly expelled from the newspaper, deprived of everything: money, peace, work, and even the opportunity to survive. What I talk about in "The Russian Question" is one of these people.

    What I talk about in this play is first and foremost an honest person and an honest journalist, the progressive American Smith, who is unwilling to write the book slandering the Soviet Union that he had agreed to write. The ending, how he is framed, deprived of his money, peace, and work—all this is talked about in the play. But the play describes not only Smith alone. It also talks about other representatives of the American press, who may not be bad people in their own nature. Under another system, they might be honest people and honest journalists, but they sell themselves to the reactionaries. In private life, they attempt to express certain principles of morality, friendship, and proper personal relationships, but in work and in social life, they ultimately manifest themselves as a sold-out scoundrel. This contradiction leads them to spiritual decadence, inner conflict, and finally moral and sometimes even physical destruction! I have represented this typical figure, commonly seen among American journalists, in Smith's friend Murphy. At the same time as these two, I also use McPherson and Gould in the play to represent the typical representatives of American newspaper owners. One of them, McPherson, is an old newspaper editor, an unprincipled vulgar person who serves his masters—the big Wall Street tycoons—but at the same time maintains a bit of prudence and appearance. However, once things involve his private interests and his personal gains and losses, he forgets all these things.

    The second one, Gould, is a typical example of a young American fascist, a representative of those who hope to establish a country in the United States that is very similar to fascist Hitler's.

    Let me talk about another character in the play, Jessie—Smith's wife. This woman is a product and a victim of bourgeois society. On the one hand, she is suited to some good feelings, can love, and can even make some small sacrifices. She herself seems to be a good person. On the other hand, because bourgeois society has damaged her, she anticipates that if her lover has no money, if her lover does not occupy an important position in society, she will not be happy with her loved one.

    From the viewpoint of American bourgeois morality, generally speaking, she is an honest woman. Even when her husband Smith goes bankrupt and she leaves him, she still thinks this is her help to him, but this is just a backward bourgeois moral concept.

    From the perspective of our advanced new morality, naturally she is a cowardly and vulgar person. She abandons her husband at the first serious test, at the first difficulty, choosing a luxurious and dissolute life instead of a clean and honest one.

    These are the few words I want to say to Chinese comrades about my play. This play is not an attack on the American people. I respect the protagonist Smith in the play, just as I respect all progressive people in the United States. But unfortunately, what is in power in the United States are the imperialists, the stupid and hateful people who are bought off. It is naturally extremely difficult for an honest person like Smith to live in the United States, and it is almost impossible to work and publicly express progressive ideas in the United States. This is what my play is about. Why do I call it "The Russian Question"? This is because the question of attitude towards the Soviet Union—that is, whether to be friendly to the Soviet Union or to be hostile to the Soviet Union—is a question that can be used to test the beliefs of everyone in the world. All progressive people in the world advocate friendship with the Soviet Union, and all reactionary elements in the world advocate hostility towards the Soviet Union. Therefore, "The Russian Question" is such a question that by raising the question, one can clearly see how the entire world is divided into two camps.

    Finally, I welcome the Chinese comrades—directors and actors—who are going to perform my play. As the author of this play, I am extremely happy and proud that our Chinese friends are interested in this play and are performing it. I sincerely hope that their success and the performance of my play can become one of the manifestations of the cultural ties and friendship between our two great nations' cultural workers, which are so needed and treasured.

　　我怎样写了《俄罗斯问题》
    为《俄罗斯问题》在中国的演出而作
    西蒙诺夫
    《俄罗斯问题》这剧本是我旅行了日本及美国之后写的。在这次为期约九月的旅行中，我有机会在日本和美国观察美国个别记者和美国整个报界的活动。自然，我在此行之前已经知道了拥有美国报纸的极大多数的美国反动分子所采取的许多不体面的方法。我知道：极大多数的美国报馆编辑和记者执行着自己主子——金融巨头——的指令，准备为了金钱而写出关于苏联，关于人民民主国家，关于任何进步现象，以及关于世界上任何国家内任何进步人士的任何诽谤之辞，但是当我直接地接触到美国报界的代表人物之后，我看到了诽谤的技巧（如果可以这样说的话），我不仅读到了他们诽谤苏联和全体进步人士的文章，我并且看到了他们是怎样干的，怎样写这些文章的，怎样遵照头子的指挥而准备变更自己的信念，或者装出变更的样子，怎样拨弄是非，怎样毫不困难地混淆黑白。
    但是与这些卖身投靠美国主子——帝国主义者——的极大多数无耻之徒同时并存着一批正直的美国记者。他们为数不很多，但是是有的。可惜能够刊载他们文章的报纸太少，简直可说差不多没有。况且即使这种报纸是有的话，它们所印份数极少，美国的广泛读者无法读到这些报纸。但是这种记者毕竟是有的。有时偶然他们能在美国的大报纸上露面。他们能够如此是因为那时政治情势由于某种原因使这些报纸的老板不得不改头换面，不时借某些记者之口发表一些多少带有进步性的言论。但是一旦政治情势改变时，美国大报纸老板们那种临时掩饰的必需性，也就消失了，他们就立即强迫供其驱策的每一记者不写他所亲历目睹的，而写对他们——反动分子——有利的东西。如果在报纸上写写文章而良心尚未泯灭的人提出抗议不甘出卖自己的笔杆，不愿执行自己主人的反动意志，则他就残酷无情地被逐出报馆，剥夺他的一切：金钱、安宁、工作、甚至生存的机会。我在《俄罗斯问题》中所说到的就是这些人中之一个。
    我在这剧中讲到的首先是一个正直的人和正直的记者，进步的美国人斯密司，他不愿写作那本约定由他写的诽谤苏联的书籍。其结局如何，如何陷害他，剥夺他的金钱、安宁、工作——关于这一切该剧中已经讲到。但是该剧所描写的不仅是斯密司一人。其中也说到美国报界的其他代表人物，单从他们本性来说可能不是坏人，他们在另一制度之下可能是正直的人和正直的记者，但是他们却卖身投靠反动派。在私生活中他们企图表现道德、友谊、正当的私交的某些原则，但在工作中在社会生活中他们归根结蒂是表现出一个卖身投靠的无赖。这种矛盾把他们导致精神的颓废，内心的冲突，最后是道德的有时甚至是肉体的毁灭！在美国记者中所习见的这种典型人物我把他表现在斯密司的朋友墨尔菲身上。与这两人同时地我在该剧中又用马菲尔逊和古尔特表示出美国报纸老板的典型代表人物。其中之一马菲尔逊是报纸老编辑，一个无原则的庸俗的为自己的主子——华尔街的大富翁——服役的人，但是同时又保持几分慎重和体貌的人，然而一旦事情牵涉到私利和他个人得失之时他把这些统统忘记了。
    其中第二个人古尔特是美国年轻法西斯分子的典型，是那些希望在美国建立非常类似法西斯希特勒式的国家的人们的代表。
    我再来谈一谈剧中的一个角色，杰茜——斯密司的妻子。这女子是资产阶级社会的产物同时又是牺牲品。一方面他适合于若干好的情感，能恋爱，甚至能做些小牺牲，本身似乎是个好人。另一方面由于资产阶级的社会损毁了她，使她预想到，如果她的爱人没有钱的话，她的爱人在社会上没有占着显要地位的话，她与心爱的人在一起是不会幸福的。
    从美国资产阶级道德的观点看来，一般说来她是个正直的女子，甚至在她丈夫斯密司破产当她脱离他的时候还认为这是她对他的帮助，但这也不过是落后的资产阶级的道德观念。
    从我们的先进的新道德看来，自然她是一个懦弱庸俗的人，她在第一次严重考验时，在第一次困难时就离弃了自己的丈夫，不选择清寒洁白的生活而选择奢华淫逸的生活。
    这便是我关于自己的剧本想向中国同志们说的几句话。这剧本不是攻击美国人民的。我尊敬剧中的主角斯密司，正如我尊敬美国所有进步人士一样。但是可惜得很，在美国当权的是帝国主义者，被人收买的愚蠢的可恶的人们。像斯密司这样正直的人在美国生活自然是极艰难的，而在美国工作，公开发表进步思想，差不多是不可能的。我的剧本所写的就是这事。为什么我称它为《俄罗斯问题》呢？这是因为对苏联态度的问题——就是对苏友好还是对苏仇视的问题，这问题是可以用来考验世界上每一人的信念的。世界上全体进步人士是主张对苏友好的，世界上一切反动分子是主张对苏仇视的。因此《俄罗斯问题》是这样的一个问题，即由问题的提出可以很清晰地看到：整个世界是如何分为两个阵营。
    最后我向要排演我这剧本的中国同志们——导演与演员们表示欢迎。我作为这剧本的作者，对我们中国朋友之感兴趣于此剧并排演它，极感高兴和骄傲。我衷心希望他们的成功，并乐闻我这剧本的演出，可以成为我们两大民族如此需要和珍贵的两国文化工作者彼此间的文化联系与友谊的表现之一。
