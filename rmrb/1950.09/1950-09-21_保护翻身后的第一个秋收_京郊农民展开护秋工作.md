　　Protecting the First Autumn Harvest After Liberation
    Farmers in the Suburbs of Beijing Launch Autumn Protection Work
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] To protect the first autumn harvest after liberation and prevent damage and theft of crops, farmers in the suburbs of Beijing have established autumn protection committees in most villages under the leadership of the government since the beginning of autumn, mobilizing and organizing farmers to participate in autumn protection. According to statistics from the 11th, 13th, 14th, and 16th districts, 2,807 autumn protection groups have been formed, with 25,325 group members.
    After the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, farmers have been liberated, and each person has their own land, so they actively participate in autumn protection work. Based on the experience of wheat protection this summer, mobilizing the masses to freely combine and take turns guarding is an effective method of crop protection. Therefore, this autumn, most areas in the suburbs of Beijing have expanded the original wheat protection groups into autumn protection groups, and under the leadership of the Public Security Bureau's police stations, they have formulated a patrol and sentry system, as well as a joint defense system between villages and districts. In general villages, farmers have specifically divided the work, with men watching at night and women and children watching during the day; individual elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed are taken care of so that they do not have to work. Party members, Youth League members, and village cadres are the backbone of the autumn protection organization, and they participate in night patrols. Because autumn protection has become a mass movement with leadership and organization, great achievements have been made, and crop theft cases have been constantly solved. For example, 17 crop theft cases were solved in the western suburbs, and 19 crop theft cases were solved in Mentougou. Farmers are generally satisfied with this method of crop protection. Farmers in Xiaohuangzhuang in the northern suburbs said, "In the past, it cost money to hire people to watch the crops and we were still worried. This year, we don't have to pay grain, and the crops aren't being lost. With everyone working together, no one dares to steal." At the same time, the Public Security Bureau has issued instructions to further combine autumn prevention work with autumn protection work, which has further strengthened public security in the suburbs and laid the foundation for winter prevention in the future.
    A few deviations have also occurred in the autumn protection work in a small number of areas. When the autumn protection was first organized, individual village cadres hired people to watch the crops in order to save trouble, but the masses were not satisfied. This has been corrected after being discovered. In a few areas affected by floods, the autumn crops were submerged, and the urgent demand of the masses was to drain the water to save the crops and prepare to plant wheat. They were not interested in autumn protection at all; however, the village cadres did not proceed from reality and forced crop protection, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Some village cadres abused punishment. For example, in Qikeshu Village in the eastern suburbs, a fifteen-year-old boy named Shi Yonglu was paraded through the streets for stealing an ear of corn; in Pingfang Village, Liu Shizhong was fined five sets of straw raincoats for cutting a stalk of sorghum while cutting grass. The above shortcomings have now been noted and corrected: all flood-affected areas should focus on draining water and planting wheat; crop thieves should be dealt with according to the severity of the crime, with serious offenders sent to court and minor offenders educated and released. Village cadres and autumn protection teams should not arbitrarily tie up, beat, or fine offenders.

　　保护翻身后的第一个秋收
    京郊农民展开护秋工作
    【京市新闻处讯】京郊农民为保护翻身后的第一个秋收，防止庄稼被破坏与偷窃，入秋以来，大部村庄在政府领导下，都先后成立了护秋委员会，发动与组织农民参加护秋。据第十一、十三、十四、十六四个区的统计，已组成护秋组二千八百零七个，有组员二万五千三百二十五人。
    京郊经过土地改革后，农民翻了身，每人都有了自己的土地，因此都积极参加护秋工作。根据今夏护麦的经验，发动群众自由结合，轮流看守是护青的有效方法。因此，今秋京郊大部地区均以原护麦组为基础扩大为护秋组，并在公安局派出所领导下制定了巡逻会哨制度及村与村、区与区的联防制度。一般村庄农民都具体分了工，男人在晚上看，妇女儿童在白天看；对个别老弱孤寡予以照顾，不让他们出工。在护秋组织中，党、团员和村干部是骨干，他们参加晚上的巡逻。由于护秋成为有领导、有组织的群众性运动，现已获得很大成绩，不断破获了偷青案件。如西郊破获了偷青案十七起，门头沟破获了偷青案十九起。农民对这种护青方法普遍感到满意。北郊小黄庄农民说：“往年花钱雇人看青还得惊心，今年不出粮了，庄稼也不丢了，大家齐心就没人敢偷。”同时，公安局已发出指示，使秋防工作与护秋工作进一步结合起来，这便更加强了郊区的治安，为今后冬防奠定了基础。
    少数地区在护秋工作中也曾发生一些偏向。刚组织护秋时，个别村干部为了省事，还是雇人看青，实际上群众并不满意，经发现后已予纠正。少数涝灾地区，秋禾被淹，群众的迫切要求是排水救禾，准备种麦，对护秋根本没有兴趣；而村干部不从实际出发，强迫护青，引起群众不满。有些村干部乱用惩罚，如东郊七棵树村一个十五岁男孩石永禄，因偷了一穗玉米被捆绑游街；平房村刘士忠因割草削了一根甜棒被罚五身蓑衣。以上缺点现已注意纠正：凡涝灾地区均以排水种麦为主；对偷青犯应分别轻重处理，重的送法院，轻的可教育释放，无论村干部及护秋小组，均不得擅自捆打罚扣。
