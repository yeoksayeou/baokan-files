Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The offensive operations of the Philippine People's Liberation Army are continuing. On the night of August 28th, the Philippine People's Liberation Army occupied a village northeast of Clark Air Base, an American air base in the Philippines, and convened a general meeting of all villagers. The city of Casiguran, located on the coast of Luzon, 200 miles north of Manila, was also occupied by the Liberation Army for two days. In recent offensives, the Philippine People's Liberation Army distributed leaflets opposing the Quirino government's dispatch of troops to intervene in Korea and exposing the Quirino government's corruption. Philippine Defense Minister Connelley admitted that the Philippine Liberation Army forces "badly beat the government troops" (United Press).

The large-scale offensive of the Philippine People's Liberation Army has frightened the reactionary groups in the Philippines, causing them to panic internally. The Quirino government held emergency meetings on August 28th and 29th to discuss so-called "measures to prevent a recurrence of the incident." On August 30th, Quirino, at a press conference, exclaimed to all Filipinos to "work together to patch up the holes." He said, "The situation in the Philippines now is like a house on fire." Regarding the attacks by some reactionary congressmen on the military authorities, Quirino said, "Now is not the time to attack or kill the security personnel or firefighters." However, under pressure from congressmen led by Senator Montano, who strongly advocated injecting "new blood" from Army Chief of Staff Castañeda downwards, Quirino finally had to announce the replacement of 24 mid-level officers.

　　菲人民解放军连续胜利
    反动集团内部惊慌失措     
    康利容承认伪军被“打得头青眼肿”
    【新华社一日讯】菲律宾人民解放军的进攻作战，仍在继续进行。八月二十八日夜，菲人民解放军攻占美国在菲空军基地克拉克机场东北的一个村庄，并召集全体村民，举行大会。吕宋岛海岸距马尼拉以北两百英里的加西古朗城，也一度被解放军占领两天。菲人民解放军在最近的多次进攻中，曾散发传单，反对季里诺政府派兵干涉朝鲜，揭发季里诺政府的贪污事迹。菲国防部长康利容承认：菲解放军部队“把政府军打得头青眼肿”（合众社）。
    菲人民解放军的大举出击，吓得菲律宾反动集团内部惊慌失措。季里诺政府于八月二十八、二十九两日连续召开紧急会议，讨论所谓“防止事件重演的措施”。八月三十日，季里诺在记者招待会上，惊呼全菲人民，要“协同弥补破洞”。他说：“现在菲律宾的局势，好像着了火的房子。”对于一些反动议员对军事当局的攻击，季里诺说：“现在不是打击或杀戮警备人员或救火人员的时候。”但在以参议员蒙塔诺为首的国会议员们力主自陆军参谋长卡斯塔尼达以下，应该注入“新血液”的压力下，季里诺终于不得不宣布撤换二十四名中级军官。
