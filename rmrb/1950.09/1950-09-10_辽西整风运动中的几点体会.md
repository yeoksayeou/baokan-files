　　Several Experiences from the Rectification Movement in Western Liaoning
    中共辽西省委 (The CCP Liaoxi Provincial Committee)
    The rectification movement in Liaoxi Province began in mid-July, and is now in the stage of reviewing work, and many important problems have already been discovered. In this period of work, the following experiences have been gained:

    I. The correct rectification guidelines, objectives, and methods must be repeatedly implemented in conjunction with the thinking of cadres. Veteran cadres are accustomed to past rectification methods; new cadres lack a deep understanding of the Party's policies and leadership methods. Therefore, in the rectification process, it is necessary to repeatedly clarify the correct guidelines of this rectification, in conjunction with cadres' ideological misconceptions, concerns, and deviations in work. It must be explained that this rectification is different from past rectifications that focused on individual self-reflection away from work; different from past "democratic meetings" that only focused on listening to some reflections from below; and different from past regular and general reviews and summaries of work. In the rectification, it is also necessary to strictly distinguish between reviewing work, summarizing experiences, analyzing situations, and launching criticism and self-criticism, from simply reviewing work and punishing cadres, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the movement.

    II. It is correct to focus on reviewing work and not statically and isolatedly reading documents, but it is absolutely not possible to relax the study and application of documents because of this. Otherwise, the review of work will lack the necessary weapons, and the thinking of cadres cannot be improved. Especially after a general review of the work has been conducted, in order to grasp the essential problems and conduct a further in-depth review, it is necessary to link the study of relevant policy documents and carry out the study of documents and the review of work in an alternating manner, promoting each other, in order to play a greater role.

    III. It is correct to focus the rectification on leading cadres at the county level and above. In the actual work process, it is necessary to combine the leading backbone with the masses. Mechanically dividing which level of cadres to rectify, thinking that it is not a leadership key and blocking the channels of speech, will lead to the upper level moving while the lower level remains still, failing to give play to the enthusiasm of all cadres, and making the review difficult to be specific and profound. Therefore, in departmental rectification, it should be emphasized that leaders at all levels (such as departments, divisions, sections, and units) should be responsible for conducting reviews. In the review, on the one hand, opinions should be raised to the higher-level leaders, and on the other hand, democracy should be promoted within their own scope to find out the important problems in the leadership of the department, and then summarize and synthesize them in turn. As for general meetings for discussion, they should be decided according to the specific situation, generally not too long, and formalism should be avoided.

    IV. In order to implement the combination of leading backbone and the masses in the rectification and give play to everyone's enthusiasm, in addition to the responsible comrades at all levels setting an example, it is also necessary to give play to the guaranteeing role of the Party branches. According to existing experience, the main responsibilities and activities of the Party branch should be to disseminate and implement the rectification guidelines, explain the rectification guidelines to everyone through Party members and cadres, promptly understand and reflect the ideological trends of cadres, promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism among cadres, and help the leadership to review, research, and improve work methods.

    V. It is correct to be able to discover problems in the rectification and find out their key, but this is only the beginning of solving the problems. What is more important is to find out solutions to the problems and correct them in actual work in a timely manner. Liaoxi has paid attention to this issue from the beginning, so various tasks have been researched and improved.

    VI. Starting with reviewing and summarizing work is an important principle of this rectification. However, it must be combined with the inspection of the responsibility system at appropriate times and occasions, and reviewed in connection with personal style and thinking; otherwise, it is easy to have a painless and superficial phenomenon of just talking and finishing, which is not very helpful to cadres. We have already felt the need for this, but there is no concrete experience yet.

　　辽西整风运动中的几点体会
    中共辽西省委
    辽西省于七月中旬开始整风，现在正在检查工作，并已发现了很多重要问题。在这一段工作中，已取得了如下几点体会：
    一、正确的整风方针、目的与方法，必须结合干部思想反复的贯彻；老干部习惯于过去的整风方法；新干部对党的政策与领导方法缺乏深刻的体会，因而在整风过程中必须结合干部思想上的错误认识、顾虑，及工作中的偏差，反复阐明此次整风的正确方针，说明此次整风与过去离开工作岗位着重个人反省的整风不同；与过去只偏重于听取下面一些反映的“民主会”不同；与过去经常的一般的检查总结工作不同。在整风中并须使检查工作、总结经验、分析情况、展开批评与自我批评与单纯检查工作、处分干部严格加以区别，才能保证运动顺利进行。
    二、以检查工作为主、不静止孤立读文件是对的，但绝不能因此放松了对文件的学习与运用。否则检查工作就缺乏必要的武器，干部思想无法提高。特别是已经对工作进行了一般检查之后，要想抓住本质问题，进一步深入的检查，就必须联系学习有关政策性的文件，并把学习文件与检查工作交叉进行，相互推动，才能发挥更大的作用。
    三、整风重点放在县以上领导干部是正确的。在实际工作进行中，必须使领导骨干与群众相结合。机械地划分整那一级干部，认为不是领导关键而闭塞言路，就会产生上动下不动，不能发挥全体干部的积极性，检查也不易具体深刻。因此，在部门整风中应强调各级领导（如厅、处、科、股）均应负责进行检查。在检查中，一方面对上级领导提意见，另一方面在自己范围内发扬民主，找出本部门领导上的重要问题，然后依次归纳综合。至于大会讨论，应根据具体情形决定，一般不宜过长，且应避免形式主义。
    四、整风中贯彻领导骨干与群众相结合，发挥大家的积极性，除了各级负责同志应以身作则外，还必须发挥支部的保证作用。按照已有的经验，支部主要责任及其活动，应是传播贯彻整风方针，通过党员干部向大家解释整风方针，及时了解并反映干部思想动态，发扬干部批评与自我批评精神，帮助领导上进行检查与研究改进工作办法。
    五、整风中能够发现问题，并找出其关键是对的，但这只能是解决问题的开始，更重要的还是找出解决问题的办法，在实际工作中及时改正。辽西一开始就注意这一问题，因此各种工作已有研究改进。
    六、从检查总结工作入手，这是此次整风的重要原则。但必须在适当的时机和场合，结合责任制的检查，联系个人作风与思想来检查；否则容易有不痛不痒说了就完的现象，对干部帮助不大。这一点我们已感到需要，但尚无具体经验。
