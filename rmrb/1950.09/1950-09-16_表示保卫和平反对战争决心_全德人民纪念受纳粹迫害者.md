Xinhua News Agency, 13th. People from all over the German Democratic Republic and West Germany held mass rallies and demonstrations on September 10, the Memorial Day for Victims of Nazi Persecution. This unanimous national action fully demonstrated the determination of all German people to defend peace, oppose war, and strive for national independence and unity.

According to the German News Agency, tens of thousands of working people in Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, held a memorial meeting on the Longs Garden Square on the 10th, with representatives of fourteen nationalities from all over the world participating. President Pieck of the Republic, speaking to 40,000 workers at a memorial meeting in Schwarzenberg, Saxony, said: "We can only live up to the dead if we concentrate all our strength to strive for the unity of the working class and the unity of the motherland, and resolutely prevent American and British imperialism from plunging mankind into a new great bloody war." Gatherings were also held in other parts of the Republic, and tributes were paid to the martyrs' tombs of those persecuted by the Nazis.

In West Germany, although the occupying authorities issued a ban beforehand, mass memorial meetings and marches were held in Frankfurt, Munich, Darmstadt and other places to protest against imperialism. Demonstrators in Munich angrily opposed the illegal release of Nazi war criminals by the United States and demanded that they be handed over to the German people for retrial. According to Reuters, the widespread commemorative activities of the West German people stated: "Today, commemorative meetings were held in cities, towns and villages throughout West Germany for those who died in Nazi gas chambers or were shot by Hitler's men." This anti-Nazi movement of the German people aroused fear and rage among the rulers of West Germany. Frankfurt police "used batons to disperse a procession that had been banned in advance and arrested ten people" (Reuters). Police in Darmstadt attacked a peaceful rally in the Peace Square, beat participants, and arrested twenty-one democrats and former victims of Nazi persecution.

　　表示保卫和平反对战争决心
    全德人民纪念受纳粹迫害者
    【新华社十三日讯】德意志民主共和国各地人民和德国西部人民，于九月十日受纳粹迫害者纪念日，曾分别举行群众大会及示威游行。这一举国一致的行动，充分显示了全德人民保卫和平、反对战争和争取国家独立与统一的决心。
    据电通社报道：德意志民主共和国首都柏林的数万劳动人民，十日曾在隆斯加登广场举行纪念大会，并有全世界十四种民族的代表们参加。共和国总统皮克在萨克森州的施瓦森堡的纪念会上，向四万劳动群众发表演说说：“我们只有集中一切力量来争取工人阶级的团结和争取祖国的统一，并坚决不准美英帝国主义把人类投入一个新的大血战中，我们才能不辜负死者。”共和国其他各地，也都举行了集会，并向受纳粹迫害者烈士墓致祭。
    在德国西部，虽然占领当局在事前下了禁令。但是在法兰克福、慕尼黑、达姆斯塔德等地都举行了群众性纪念大会和游行，向帝国主义实行了抗议示威。慕尼黑的游行群众愤怒地反对美国非法释放纳粹战犯，要求交予德国人民重审。西德人民广泛的纪念活动，据路透社报道说：“在西德全境各市、镇、村庄内，今日都有为死在纳粹煤气室里或被希特勒手下枪毙的人们举行的纪念会”。德国人民这种反纳粹运动，激起了西德统治者的恐惧与暴怒。法兰克福警察以“棍棒逐散事前禁止游行的队伍，且逮捕十人”（路透社）。达姆斯塔德的警察袭击了和平广场的纪念大会，毒打与会群众，并逮捕了二十一个民主分子和前受纳粹迫害者。
