　　Several Issues in Developing Troop Dance
    Zhao Wenbin
    In the past, the Yangko dance was very popular in the troops, but the twisting and turning was always the same old routine, and everyone could not feel satisfied; moreover, the light and brisk posture of the Yangko dance could not express the heroic spirit of the People's Liberation Army. Later, the Yangko dance was no longer performed, but for a long time, we couldn't come up with anything new to replace it. Around the Spring Festival this year, influenced by other fraternal troops, we boldly explored military dance. The division's cultural troupe created the "Army, Navy, and Air Force Dance"; with the help of students from Hebei Normal College, our physical training team learned the "Unity is Strength" workers' dance; and the various regiments also created seventeen or eighteen production dances, shooting dances, bayonet charge dances, combat dances, etc. There are many problems in these dances, and I am now putting them forward for everyone to study.
    First, the purpose of developing dance in the army: Its purpose is to practice physical movements, enliven emotions, strengthen the concept of collectivism, and cultivate a spirit of unity, tension, liveliness, and joy. Dance itself is an art, therefore, reflecting life is not the same as flatly moving combat, learning, production, etc. over without any processing. If the bayonet charge dance is unchangeably used to practice bayonet charge, the hoeing in the production dance is exactly like farmers hoeing, and the shooting dance must follow the shooting essentials, then I think that would be too rigid. Dance itself needs a certain beauty from life, and troop dance reflects the beauty in the lives of troop soldiers. Therefore, we must never regard operations as dance; or regard the cook's cutting vegetables and steaming buns in daily life as dance. Dance must select those things that can represent the ideological and emotional characteristics of the People's Liberation Army, that can express a typical thing in the life of the People's Liberation Army, and express it through the images of movements such as training, cutting vegetables, and steaming buns, then the purpose of developing military dance will be achieved.
    Some people demand that every dance, like soldiers acting as soldiers in performances, must have a certain "political significance." I think this requirement is inappropriate. For example, in the "Army, Navy, and Air Force Dance," sixteen people act as cavalry, stacked into warships, tanks, and airplanes, with coordinated movements and magnificent and beautiful steps. After seeing it, the audience feels comfortable and happy, which means the dance has produced a positive effect. The production dance reflects the heroic posture of the soldiers' collective labor and the enthusiasm for building the motherland and loving labor. Naturally, vulgar and low-level tastes in dance and things that are not suitable for the emotions of revolutionary soldiers should be completely discarded.
    Some people also advocate that troop dance must be collective dances for entire companies or battalions. They mechanically and one-sidedly understand collectivity and mass participation. I believe that as long as the military dance uses a certain image, it can be danced by three or more people. Because a dance with three or more people can express a life theme, is easy to combine, and easy to achieve uniformity. After all, dance is not gymnastics, but an emotional exercise in extracurricular activities. If it is completely unit-based, with the duty officer leading and directing, and it is not voluntary by the masses, it will limit the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.
    Based on the purpose of our dance, we should select themes from our lives, mobilize soldiers to create together, and dance as long as the soldiers like to see and hear, and can express the heroic posture of the People's Liberation Army. But the image of the theme must be clear. Facts have proved that although the things created by the soldiers are rough, they can be gradually improved through continuous exploration, so that they become a finalized and perfect thing. When we have not yet created a finalized and perfect thing, we should not take a discouraging attitude towards the soldiers' creation, but should help them improve and process it, and give play to their creative wisdom and enthusiasm.
    Second, the issue of dance steps and formation changes: The People's Liberation Army dance should have new steps that represent the style and spirit of the People's Liberation Army. In the past, in several dances, holding guns, reclaiming wasteland, etc., we used the steps of children's dance, which was very uncoordinated, and some were even more constrained than the marching pace on the playground, making the audience uncomfortable for the dancers because their posture was too unnatural. Some used the three-step-one-stop step of folk Yangko dance, but without twisting their hips, it didn't look good either. Only the steps in the cultural troupe's "Army, Navy, and Air Force Dance," when entering the stage, with big strides and swinging arms, were considered better by everyone. We should draw materials from the various lives of our soldiers to create movements and postures. If we can master the techniques, learn some good dance skills and postures from the Soviet Red Army dance and Chinese folk dance, and at the same time use them to express the rich emotions of our soldiers today, that would of course be the best. Changes in formation must be determined according to the content and plot of the performance. Currently, the formula in dance is often two teams at the beginning, then changing to two horizontal rows in the middle, and then a little more complex is two people holding hands, with others drilling through the gaps, and finally stacking arhats, holding up a few words, such as "Do a Good Job in the 1950 Production Campaign," etc. We must break through this simple and rigid style, give play to the soldiers' free creation, and make the steps and formations free to stretch. This is the most important issue at present.
    Third, the issue of dance image and emotion: Dance reflects real life through moving images. Therefore, we must find its steps and postures in the dynamic laws of the dance image, and then through the rich emotions of the dancers, can we achieve the expected effect of the performance. For example, when performing a cavalry dance without the emotion of rushing into battle and engaging in fierce combat, it will not give people a tense combat atmosphere. At the same time, if the emotion is very rich, but the movements are not skilled or the plot within the dance is not understood, it will also not give the audience any deep emotion. Therefore, every movement and posture in the dance should be expressed through a certain ideology and emotion; and every kind of ideology and emotion must be completed by movements and postures.
    Fourth, the issue of musical accompaniment and interlude: A certain company's shooting dance used a harmonica to play children's dance music for accompaniment, the production dance used small gongs and drums for Yangko dance drumbeats, and some used erhu and nanhu for accompaniment, but the results were all uncoordinated. The accompaniment of the dance is to enhance the effect of the rhythm, but in some of our company's dances, the opposite is true. So the soldiers said: "As soon as the instruments sound, it's like twisting Yangko; as soon as the harmonica is blown, it's like a child, and you don't dare to take a big step." In addition, some dances used folk big drums and gongs, and the accompaniment of gongs completely created new points, and the soldiers danced with vigor and harmonious emotions. For example, when throwing a grenade, the "dong" sound of the big drum is just like the explosion of a grenade. After the start of the battle, the war drumbeats in the old opera were used, which was full of combat atmosphere. Some copper gongs and bugles were also good. Although these are still very rough, they are emotionally harmonious, so they are successful. The company has already bought gongs and drums, and we are gradually building them. If accompaniment is not used, the steps are not easy to be uniform. Now some companies use a flute to direct, and the dance steps and formation changes as soon as the flute is blown. The accompaniment is not harmonious with the majestic steps, which destroys the majestic emotions, which is inappropriate.
    Some interludes in the dance are sung while dancing, such as the seventh company singing the "Our Weapons" song in the training dance, and everyone thinks it is good because the movements, music, emotions, and steps are consistent. But most of the dances are sung together after the dance is over, so that the interlude is disconnected from the dance, and the interlude destroys the emotions of the dance. But it is also inappropriate to require every dance to have an interlude and to sing while dancing; at the same time, the current situation in the company cannot do it. I think that whenever it is possible to use an interlude, it must be used, and it is best to be able to sing while dancing. It is difficult for comrades in a company to create songs by themselves. I hope that comrades in the army who are engaged in music will create more songs for the company's dance in the future, which is what our company's dancers urgently welcome.

### 开展部队舞蹈的几个问题

　　开展部队舞蹈的几个问题
    赵文彬
    过去，秧歌舞在部队里很流行，但扭来扭去总是老一套，大家不能感到满足；而且秧歌舞的轻快姿态，也不能表达出人民解放军的雄壮气魄。后来秧歌舞不扭了，但好长时间想不出新的东西来代替它。今年春节前后，在其他兄弟部队影响下，我们大胆地试探了一下军人舞。师文工队创造了“海陆空军舞”；由于河北省师范学院同学的帮助，我们的体育训练队学会了“团结就是力量”的工人舞；各团也创造了十七八个生产舞、射击舞、刺杀舞、战斗舞等。在这些舞蹈中，有着不少问题，现在我把它提出来供大家研究。
    一、军队开展舞蹈的目的问题：它的目的在于练习身体动作，活跃情绪，加强集体观念，培养团结、紧张、活泼、愉快的精神。舞蹈本身是一种艺术，因此，它反映生活不等于把平板的战斗、学习、生产等毫不加工地搬过来。如果刺杀舞一成不变地去练刺杀，生产舞中的锄地就完全像农民锄地，射击舞就要按着射击要领，那我认为这就太死板了。舞蹈本身需要一定生活里的美，部队舞蹈是反映部队战士生活里的美的。因此，绝不能把操作看成舞蹈；或把日常生活里炊事员的切菜，蒸馍都看成舞蹈。舞蹈必须选择那些能代表解放军的思想感情特点的，能表现解放军生活里一种典型的东西，通过操练，切菜，蒸馍等动作的形象而表现出来，那就达到开展军人舞蹈的目的了。
    有的人要求每个舞蹈，必须像兵演兵的演唱一样，都有一定的“政治意义”。我认为这种要求是不适当的。譬如“海陆空军舞”，十六个人当骑兵，叠成军舰、坦克、飞机，动作整齐、步伐雄壮美观，观众看后都感到舒畅愉快，这就是舞蹈产生了积极的作用。生产舞反映了战士们集体劳动的雄姿和建设祖国，热爱劳动的热情。自然，舞蹈中的庸俗低级趣味，不适宜革命军人情感的东西，应当完全摈弃。
    又有人主张部队舞蹈必须是整连整营的集体舞，他们机械地片面地了解集体性与群众性。我认为军人舞蹈，只要通过一定的形象，有三个人以上就可以跳起来。因为三个人以上的舞蹈，它就可以表现一个生活主题，且易结合，容易作到整齐一致。舞蹈毕竟不是体操，而是课外活动中感情的操练。如完全以连营为单位，由值星员带着去指挥，不是群众自觉自愿的，那会限制了群众的积极性和创造性。
    根据我们舞蹈的目的，从我们生活中选择主题，发动战士大家创造，只要是战士们喜闻乐见的，能够表现解放军英姿的，就可以跳起来。但主题的形象必须明确。事实证明战士创造的东西虽然是粗糙的，但在不断的摸索中，就可以逐渐改进，以致使它成为定型的完美的东西。当我们还未创造出定型的完美的东西时，对战士的创造不能采取泼凉水的态度，应当是帮助他们改进加工，发挥他们的创造智慧和积极性。
    二、舞蹈的步法和队形变化问题：解放军舞应有代表解放军风格和气魄的新步法。我们过去在几个舞蹈中，持枪、开荒等都是采用儿童舞的步法，十分不协调，有的比操场的齐步走更加拘束起来，使观众替舞蹈的人难受，因为它的姿态太不自然了。有的采用民间秧歌舞三步一站的步法，但不扭屁股了，看起来也不好。惟有文工队的“海陆空军舞”中的步法，出场时，是以跨大步齐走，两臂甩起来，大家认为比较好。我们应当从我们战士的各种生活中去找取素材，来创造动作和姿态。如果我们能掌握技术，从苏联红军舞中，和中国的民间舞中去摄取某些好的舞术和姿态，同时使用它表现出今天我们战士的丰富感情，那当然是最好的。队形的变化必须根据表演的内容和情节来决定。目前舞蹈中的公式，往往出场是二队，中间变为两个横排，再复杂一点的是两个人拉着手，其他人钻空隙，最后叠罗汉，拿上几个字，例如“搞好五○年大生产”等。我们必须突破这种简单的刻板的样式，发挥战士的自由创造，使步法和队伍能自由伸展。这是当前一个最重大的问题。
    三、舞蹈的形象和感情问题：舞蹈是通过动的形象去反映现实生活的。所以必须把舞蹈的形象在动的规律中去找出它的步法和姿态，然后通过舞蹈者的丰富的感情，才能达到演出上预期的效果。譬如没有临敌冲锋蹈阵紧张战斗的感情而去表演骑兵舞时，那就不会给人以紧张战斗的气氛。同时，如果感情很丰富，而动作上不熟练或体会不到舞蹈内的情节，同样也不会给观众有什么深刻的感动。因此，舞蹈中的每一个动作和姿态，都应是通过一定的思想感情表达出来的；每一种思想感情，也必靠动作和姿态去完成。
    四、音乐的伴奏和插曲问题：某连射击舞用口琴吹儿童舞的曲子伴奏，生产舞用小锣、小鼓的秧歌舞鼓点伴奏，还有的用二胡，南胡伴奏的，但结果都不谐调。舞蹈的伴奏，是为了增强节奏的效果，在我们有些连队的舞蹈都与此相反。所以战士们说：“家伙一响，就像扭秧歌的；一吹口琴，就像小孩一样，步子也不敢迈了。”另外，有的舞蹈，采用了民间大鼓大锣，锣的伴奏完全创造新点，战士舞蹈起来精神振作，感情谐调。譬如投弹时，大鼓“咚”的一声，恰像手榴弹爆炸。作战开始后，用旧戏中的战鼓点，富有战斗气氛。有的铜锣军号也不错。这些虽然还是很粗糙，但在感情上是谐调的，所以它是成功的。连队已有的买了锣鼓，我们正在逐渐建设中。如果不用伴奏，步法不易整齐一致。现在有些连队用口笛指挥，口笛一吹，就跳步伐换队形，伴奏和雄壮的步伐不谐调，破坏了雄壮的感情，是不妥当的。
    舞蹈中的插曲有的是边舞边唱，如七连在练兵舞中唱“我们的武器”歌，动作、音乐、感情、步法一致，大家认为还好。但多数的舞蹈，是在舞蹈完了之后，集合唱个歌，这样使插曲和舞蹈脱节，插曲破坏了舞蹈的情绪。但要求每个舞蹈都有插曲，都边舞边唱也不妥当；同时，目前连队情况也作不到。我认为凡是可能用插曲，必须插曲，又能作到边舞边唱的最好。一个连队的同志自己创造歌曲是困难的。希望部队内从事音乐的同志们，今后多创造为连队舞蹈的歌曲，这是我们连队舞蹈者所迫切欢迎的。
