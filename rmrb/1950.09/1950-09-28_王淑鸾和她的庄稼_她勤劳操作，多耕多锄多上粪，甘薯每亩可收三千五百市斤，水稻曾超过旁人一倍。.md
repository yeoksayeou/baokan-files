　　Wang Shuluan and Her Crops.
    She diligently operates, plows and hoes more, and applies more fertilizer. Her sweet potatoes can yield 3,500 catties per mu, and her rice has once exceeded that of others by one time.
  Developed a good habit of labor since childhood.
    Wang Shuluan from Fujian has been selected as a representative to the National Congress of Labor Heroes of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers because of her careful cultivation, which has increased her yield by more than twice that of ordinary farmers.
    Wang Shuluan is from Huzhu Township, Hui'an County. She lived a hard life since she was a child. At the age of eight, she followed her father to work in the fields; from the age of fifteen, because her father was old and weak, the heavy burden of farming fell on her and her sister. In this way, she developed a good skill in farming since she was a child.
    When she was eighteen years old, Zheng Shuixing, a rich peasant, coveted her ability and forced her to marry him as his daughter-in-law. After entering the family, she suffered abuse from her mother-in-law and husband, not having enough to eat or wear, toiling all day long, and being beaten and scolded became commonplace. On the evening of February 10, 1946, her husband went out to gamble. When he returned home at midnight, he beat her severely because she opened the door a little slowly, and her husband drove her out with a gun. She had to return to her parents' home. In the following two years, because she felt that she had no chance to turn over, she attempted suicide several times but failed.
  Knowing that she wants to turn over, she is more active in production.
    In 1948, Wang Shuluan's awareness was raised under the education of her younger brother (a Communist Party member). She knew that with the Communist Party, the poor would turn over sooner or later. Therefore, she had confidence in production and actively helped the local Party comrades with their work. At the same time, she was more diligent and meticulous in her cultivation than others. For the sweet potato fields, others only plowed once, harrowed once, and perfunctorily prepared the ridges; she plowed and harrowed at least twice, and sifted the soil. The ridge preparation should achieve "smooth ditches and loose soil." This way, water will not accumulate easily, diseases will be reduced, and sweet potatoes will grow quickly. She got up early in the morning every day to go to the fields and returned home to rest when it was dark. Others applied fertilizer only two or three times, each time less than 25 dan of human urine fertilizer per mu; she applied fertilizer at least four times, and each time she applied 40-50 dan per mu. When there was not enough fertilizer, she raised more poultry and livestock such as chickens, ducks, pigs, and sheep to increase barnyard manure. At the same time, she mobilized her younger brother and sister to go up the mountains to pick up wild manure, hoe grass skins, and dig rotten mud from ditches as supplementary fertilizer. Wang Shuluan can also use various fertilizers according to the nature of the soil and crops. For example, when planting sweet potatoes in sandy fields, more rotten mud should be applied; when planting peanuts in yellow soil, more wood ash should be applied, plus a small amount of fine sand. To be more suitable for crop growth.
  Diligent in repairing ditches, turning vines, and sweet potatoes grow strong
    During the sweet potato growing season, after each rain, she would go to turn the vines, repair the ditches, and loosen the soil. When turning the vines, she carefully arranged the vines into a spiral shape and covered the entire ridge surface, so that the sun would not easily harm the potato roots, and the potato vines would not grow loose roots, and the nutrients could be concentrated on the potatoes. No one else has her careful method of turning vines.
    When the sweet potatoes are about to mature, she first watered the ridge surface, and then dug out the more mature sweet potatoes from the cracks. After digging, she immediately added a thin fertilizer or water to allow the smaller sweet potatoes to obtain sufficient space and nutrients for development. The dug-out sweet potatoes can also remedy the summer grain shortage.
    Wang Shuluan is not only good at raising sweet potatoes, but she can also pay attention to selecting and changing seeds. She often goes to buy potato seedlings more than a hundred miles away. When cultivating sweet potato seedlings, she transplants them one more time than others (generally only transplanted once, she transplants twice), so that her sweet potatoes can not only grow faster and stronger, but also solve the difficulty of insufficient potato seedlings. When planting, she can also master the method of crop rotation: plant sweet potatoes in the first season, wheat in the second season, and leguminous crops such as white beans and peanuts in the third season. During the interval between planting crops, she turns the soil after each rain, so that the soil fertility will not be lost, and the land that was originally planted only two seasons is planted with three seasons of crops, and the harvest is much more than that of others.
  Deep plowing and careful cultivation, the yield is more than twice that of others
    When cultivating paddy fields, Wang Shuluan also plows, harrows, and applies fertilizer more often. She pays special attention to the rice paddies. In addition to careful plowing and harrowing, she also chooses the most suitable fertilizer for the growth of rice seedlings, and topdressing often reaches as many as five times, so her rice seedlings are stronger than others, and the roots are placed flat during transplanting, so they grow quickly.
    Due to her careful cultivation, the crops grow better and yield more than others. Her sweet potatoes can produce seven or eight per plant, weighing three or four catties, and the best can produce six or seven catties. Each mu can produce 3,500 catties, which is one to one and a half times more than others. Each mu of rice can produce 350 catties per season (bad fields), and the yield exceeds twice that of others with the same soil quality. The yields of other crops such as peanuts and white beans are also more than 40% higher than others. Farmers in villages within a dozen miles around can recognize which crop is Wang Shuluan's. And people often come to her to learn cultivation methods, and her answer is only one sentence: "My experience is to work diligently, plow more, hoe more, and apply more fertilizer."
  Organizing women has improved production efficiency
    Wang Shuluan is not only a production expert, but she is also very good at organizing other women for production. Since the liberation of Hui'an, she has organized a total of 135 women, 15 children's song and dance teams, 40 women's literacy classes, 12 women's mutual aid groups, and 65 men's labor teams in her township, helping many people change their habits of not working. Therefore, the work efficiency in this year's peanut digging has increased by more than one time. The efficiency of other production and cultivation has also increased.

　　王淑鸾和她的庄稼
    她勤劳操作，多耕多锄多上粪，甘薯每亩可收三千五百市斤，水稻曾超过旁人一倍。
  自小养成了劳动的优良习惯
    福建的王淑鸾由于她的精耕细作、产量比一般农民增加一倍以上。这次被选为出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表。
    王淑鸾，是惠安县互助乡人。从小就过着艰苦的生活。八岁跟着父亲下田耕作；十五岁起，因父亲年老力衰，所有耕作的重担都落在她和姐姐二人身上。她就这样自小锻炼出一身种田的好本领。
    十八岁那年，富农郑水兴贪她能干，强娶她作媳妇。过门后，受尽婆婆和丈夫的虐待，吃不饱、穿不暖、整日操劳，挨打受骂成了家常便饭。一九四六年二月十日的晚上，丈夫出门赌博。午夜返家，因她开门稍慢了一点，就挨了一顿痛打，丈夫并用手枪赶她出门。她只得回娘家。以后的两年中，因她感到自己没有翻身的日子，几曾自杀未成。
  知道要翻身，生产更积极。
    一九四八年，王淑鸾在弟弟（共产党员）教育下，觉悟提高，她知道：有了共产党，穷苦人迟早会翻身的。因此对生产有了信心，并积极地帮助当地党的工作同志工作。同时她在耕作上比旁人勤劳，精细，甘薯田，旁人只犁一次、耙一次、整畦马虎了事；她至少犁、耙两次，并且把泥土筛过。整畦要做到“沟滑土松”。这样才不易积水，减少病害，让甘薯长的快。她每天大清早就起身下田，天黑了才返家休息。旁人上粪只二、三次，每次每亩不到二十五担人尿粪；她至少上四次粪，而每次每亩都要上三、四十担。肥料不足时，她就多养鸡鸭猪羊等家禽家畜，增加厩肥。同时发动小弟小妹上山拾野粪，锄草皮，挖水沟烂泥作补助肥料。王淑鸾还能根据土壤及作物的性质使用各种肥料，如在沙多的田地里种甘薯，应多上烂泥；在黄土地里种花生，就多施草木灰，再加少量细沙。以更适于作物生长。
  勤整沟、翻藤、甘薯长的壮大
    甘薯生长期间，每逢雨后她就去翻藤、整沟、松土，翻藤时很细心地把藤子整理成螺旋形，覆盖在整个畦面，使太阳不易侵害薯根、薯藤也不生松根，养分就可集中于薯上了。她这样仔细翻藤的耕作法旁人是没有的。
    甘薯快成熟了，她就先在畦面浇过水，然后在有裂痕的地方挖出较成熟的甘薯，挖后立刻加一次稀肥或水，使较小的甘薯获得充分发展的地盘与养分。挖出来的甘薯还可以补救夏季粮荒。
    王淑鸾不但善于养种甘薯，她又能注意选种换种。她往往不辞劳苦地跑到百里以外去选购薯苗。培植甘薯苗时，又比别人多移植一次（一般只移植一次，她移植两次），这样她的甘薯，不但可以长的更快更壮，又可解决薯苗不足的困难。种植时，她还能掌握轮种的方法：第一季种甘薯，第二季就种小麦，第三季种白豆、花生等豆科作物。种作物间隔时间内，每逢雨后便翻土，这样使土壤肥力不至受到损失，并将本来只种两季的地，种上了三季作物，收成又比旁人的地多得多。
  深耕细作，产量比人多一倍以上
    耕水田时，王淑鸾同样是多耕多耙多上粪，对秧田更特别注意，除精耕细耙外，还选择最适合于秧苗长大的肥料，上追肥往往达五次之多，所以她的秧苗比人家的茁壮，且移植时放根平，长的快。
    由于她的精耕细作，庄稼都比旁人的长得好，产量多。她的甘薯每株可生七八个，重三、四斤，最好的可产六、七斤。每亩可产三千五百市斤，比旁人多收一倍至一倍半。水稻每亩一季可产三百五十市斤（坏田），产量超过旁人同样地质的田地的一倍。其他作物如花生、白豆等的产量也都比旁人多产百分之四十以上。周围十多里内村庄的农民都认得出那块庄稼是王淑鸾的。并常常有人找上门来向她学习耕作方法，她的答复只有一句：“我的经验就是勤劳操作、多耕多锄多上粪”。
  组织妇女，提高了生产效率
    王淑鸾不但是个生产能手，她对组织其他妇女生产也很有办法。自惠安解放以来，她在本乡一共组织了妇女一百三十五人；儿童歌舞队十五人；妇女识字班四十人；妇女互助组十二人；男子帮工队六十五人；帮助许多人改变不劳动的习惯，因此在今年大家刨花生中，工作效率提高了一倍以上。其他生产耕作效率也有提高。
