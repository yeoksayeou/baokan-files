Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, September 5th: The Canadian Peace Congress has announced that a delegation of Canadian peace advocates will go to Parliament during the parliamentary discussion of the bill to form a special brigade to send to the Korean War, requesting that Parliament support a peaceful negotiated settlement of the Korean question based on Nehru's proposal.

Due to the police arresting and mistreating veterans who were collecting signatures for peace petitions at the National Exhibition in Toronto, the Canadian Peace Congress has urged national democratic organizations to launch a campaign to protest the suppression of peace signature collection.
