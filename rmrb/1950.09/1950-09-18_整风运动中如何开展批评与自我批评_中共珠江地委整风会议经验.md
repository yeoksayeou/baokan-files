How to Conduct Criticism and Self-Criticism in the Rectification Movement
Experiences from the CPC Zhujiang Prefectural Committee Rectification Meeting

The CPC Zhujiang Prefectural Committee, in its rectification meeting, gained preliminary experience on how to conduct criticism and self-criticism in the rectification movement in the new district:

I. The first hurdle is to focus on dispelling cadres’ concerns about launching criticism and self-criticism. Comrades who have long been in underground work and guerrilla warfare environments are not very accustomed to democratic life within the Party. After liberation, work was busy and urgent, and there were few bottom-up work reviews, so there were ideological concerns about criticizing work and leaders from the bottom up. There were three main concerns: first, fear of hurting feelings; second, fear of speaking incorrectly; and third, fear of retaliation from superiors. Therefore, at the beginning of the rectification, the leadership must repeatedly explain the significance of the rectification, call on everyone to "say everything they know and say it without reservation," guarantee "the speaker is not to be blamed, but the listener should take warning," and express "correct mistakes if you have them, and be encouraged if you don't." In particular, responsible cadres should have a full spirit of self-criticism in their work summaries. In the process of inspecting work, the leadership must listen attentively and consider the criticisms raised by everyone, and use various methods to encourage everyone to speak. The attitude of the leading comrades in seriously conducting self-criticism and humbly listening to criticism is the most powerful practical mobilization for launching criticism and self-criticism. The Zhujiang Prefectural Committee rectification meeting, based on the above spirit, dispelled the ideological concerns of a few comrades. Furthermore, because some of the comrades attending the meeting had already participated in the previous two rectification movements, the reviews and criticisms at the meeting were generally serious, sincere, and full of positive and constructive elements.

II. According to the law of motion development, after the ideological concerns about criticism have been eliminated and criticism has been launched, it is necessary to prevent excessive and unrealistic tendencies. This is the second point to correctly launch criticism and ensure the smooth progress of the rectification movement. Leading cadres must guide criticism to the correct path, otherwise the problem cannot be truly solved. After moving from not daring to criticize to launching criticism, one-sided views are likely to occur: some exaggerate shortcomings and obliterate advantages, even only seeing shortcomings and not seeing advantages; some only pursue subjective reasons without considering objective circumstances, thereby pushing all responsibility to the leadership. A few people with low political and ideological levels even nitpick on minor issues. In this case, the leadership is prone to two deviations: first, adopting a rejecting attitude towards criticism. This may be due to insufficient ideological preparation in advance, lack of experience; or the existence of complacency, making it difficult to accept opinions from below and generating anger and confrontational emotions. Second, adopting a laissez-faire attitude towards criticism. Some leading comrades, seeing the great intensity of criticism, are either afraid of hurting the tender shoots of democracy, and keep "letting go," or even reluctantly accept all criticism. Neither of these two deviations can solve the problem. The former will strike a blow at criticism or arouse resentment and bring the meeting to a standstill; the latter will distort the truth and foster unhealthy tendencies. The correct attitude is to put forward the principle of "upholding the truth and correcting mistakes" for everyone to abide by. And advocate the method of specifically analyzing problems, explaining that specific analysis of problems is the most active and powerful criticism. The leadership should summarize the issues, let everyone analyze and discuss them freely, and finally make a correct and appropriate conclusion. That is to say, launching criticism and self-criticism by mobilizing the masses must have strong leadership.

III. Sufficient preparations must be made in terms of ideology, organization, and materials in advance. Especially since this rectification meeting is the first after liberation, many comrades still lack experience, the work tasks are heavy, and time is tight, there is a greater need for full deliberation and preparation. The Zhujiang Prefectural Committee rectification meeting was not prepared enough. This is reflected in: (1) The Standing Committee's review and summary of half a year's work was not thorough enough. (2) No branch was organized in advance to carry out in-depth mobilization ideologically and organizationally, and small groups were only organized during the meeting. (3) Relevant documents on half a year's work, instructions from superiors, and decisions of the prefectural committee were not compiled and printed for everyone to refer to and study, which prolonged the formal meeting time.

IV. In the review and summary work, everyone must be organized to carefully read the documents (major instructions from superiors and decisions of the prefectural committee related to this year's work, and the rectification documents designated by the South China Sub-Bureau), so that criticism and self-criticism can be launched in the spirit of combining theory with practice. In the discussion, it is necessary to oppose the tendency of empiricism, which does not read documents, has no standards and principles, and has its own set of methods; and also to oppose the tendency of dogmatism, which is divorced from reality, randomly attaches labels, and randomly applies facts. It is necessary to advocate the spirit of objectively, comprehensively, and realistically analyzing the situation.

### 整风运动中如何开展批评与自我批评  中共珠江地委整风会议经验

　　整风运动中如何开展批评与自我批评
    中共珠江地委整风会议经验
    中共珠江地委在整风会议中，对于在新区整风运动中如何开展批评与自我批评，获得了初步经验：
    一、第一关要着重打破干部对展开批评与自我批评的顾虑。长期处在地下工作与游击战争的环境的同志们，对党内民主生活不大习惯；解放后工作繁忙紧迫，很少自下而上地进行工作检讨，因之对自下而上地批评工作批评领导，在思想上是有所顾虑的。主要的顾虑有三种：一、怕伤害情面；二、怕自己说得不对；三、怕上级报复。因之领导上在整风开始时，就须反复说明整风意义，号召“知无不言，言无不尽”，保证“言者无罪，闻者足戒”，表示“有则改之，无则加勉”，特别是在负责干部的工作总结中要有充分的自我批评的精神。在检查工作过程中，领导上对大家所提出的批评要虚心地倾听与考虑，并用各种办法鼓励大家发言。而领导同志认真进行自我批评与虚心倾听批评的态度，更是展开批评与自我批评的最有力的实际动员。地委整风会议本上述精神，解除了少数同志的思想顾虑，又因为出席会议的同志中，有些已经参加过前两次的整风运动，因之会议上的检讨批评大都能做到严肃诚恳而富有积极性和建设性。
    二、根据运动发展规律，当对批评的思想顾虑已经消除后，批评已经展开之后，就要防止产生过火、不实事求是的偏向。这是正确展开批评保证整风运动顺利前进的第二点。领导干部必须把批评引导到正确的途径，否则就不能真正的解决问题。从不敢批评到展开批评后，片面的观点是很容易发生的：有的夸大缺点抹煞优点，甚至只见缺点不见优点；有的只追究主观原因而不顾到客观情况，从而将一切责任都推到领导方面。个别政治思想水平低的人甚至在枝节问题上吹毛求疵。在这种情况下，领导上往往容易发生两种偏差：一、对批评采拒绝的态度。这或者是由于事前思想准备不足，缺少经验；或者存在自满情绪因而对下面的意见难以接受而产生气愤与对抗情绪。二、对批评采取自流的态度，有些领导同志看到批评的火力大，或者是怕伤害民主的嫩芽，而一直“放手”，甚至勉强接受一切批评。这两种偏向都是不能解决问题的。前者会打击批评或激起反感而使会议陷于僵局；后者会歪曲真理而助长歪风。正确的态度是提出“坚持真理、修正错误”的原则，使大家共同遵守。并提倡具体分析问题的办法，说明对问题的具体分析是最积极的、有力的批评。领导上要将问题归纳起来，放手让大家分析讨论，最后作出正确而恰当的结论。这就是说，放手发动群众展开批评与自我批评时必须有坚强的领导。
    三、事先必须在思想上、组织上、物质上做好充分准备。尤其是这次整风会议是解放后的第一次，很多同志还缺乏经验，工作任务繁重，时间紧迫的情况下，更需要有充分酝酿和准备。珠江地委整风会的准备是不够的。这表现在：（一）常委对半年工作的检查总结得不够充分。（二）事先没有组织支部，以便从思想上组织上作深入的动员，在会议过程中才组织起小组。（三）有关半年工作的文件、上级指示及地委的决定等没有辑印出来供大家参考研究，使正式会议拖长了时间。
    四、在检查总结工作中，必须组织大家认真阅读文件（与本年度工作有关的主要的上级指示、地委决定，及华南分局指定的整风文件），使得在理论与实际结合的精神下去展开批评与自我批评。在讨论中既要反对不读文件、漫无标准原则、各有一套的经验主义倾向；又要反对脱离实际、乱戴帽子、乱套事实的教条主义倾向。要提倡客观地全面地实事求是地进行分析的精神。
