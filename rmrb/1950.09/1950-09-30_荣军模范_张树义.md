　　Model of Revolutionary Martyr – Zhang Shuyi
    Xin Yi
    Zhang Shuyi is 45 years old this year, and comes from Liangqiangou Village, a natural village in Shankou Village, Lingshou County, Hebei Province. Before 1940, he was a model soldier and combat hero of the Eighth Route Army. He lost both legs in the battle against the national enemy – Japanese imperialism. After retiring, he actively participated in labor and led the villagers to produce, and became a labor hero admired by everyone.

  I. Holding the Ground, Losing Both Legs
    Zhang Shuyi was born into a poor family. A family of more than a dozen people lived by renting land from the landlord Zhou Laoqin. The income from a year of hard work, after paying four dan and two dou of rent to the landlord, only left some melons and vegetables, which was not enough to eat for half a year. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, there was a drought, and no grain was harvested in the fields. The landlord forced them to pay the rent, and in the middle of winter, the whole family was driven out of their five thatched houses. Zhang Shuyi begged from door to door with tears in his eyes. This is how they spent the winter in the wind and snow.
    In 1937, the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out. The Kuomintang army retreated south in a panic, and Zhang Shuyi was caught and sent to Henan to deliver supplies to her husband. At this time, the Eighth Route Army came to Lingshou County, led the people to resist Japan, and implemented rent and interest reduction and reasonable burden. After Zhang Shuyi escaped from Henan, he saw that the family's situation was better than before, so he took his eldest nephew, Jinshan, to join the militia company.
    Soon, the militia company was promoted to a regular army unit under General Nie Rongzhen – the Fourth Regiment. Zhang Shuyi became a well-known machine gunner in this unit.
    In 1940, during the battle of Longquanguan, he lost his legs for the revolution.
    When three or four thousand enemies attacked Longquanguan, he led four machine guns to guard the forward hilltop position. In order to complete the task given to him by the Party, he was determined to live and die with the position. He knew that if his position was lost, the entire battle would be a failure.
    For three days and nights, enemy planes and heavy artillery fiercely bombarded, covering countless infantry charges. In the end, only Zhang Shuyi and a machine gun remained, and finally held the hilltop position. He and his machine gun crushed the enemy's last charge, and the enemy was defeated. But a fierce bombing by enemy planes sent the machine gun flying into the sky. When the battalion commander led reinforcements to rescue Zhang Shuyi from the pit, both of his legs had been blown off below the knees.

  II. "Production is still my old expertise, I will never lie down and let the public support me."
    In April 1941, he returned home with glory and wounds. From then on, he could no longer walk upright. However, this vibrant and indomitable Communist Party member did not see himself as a disabled person. He often said: "As long as I don't die, this half of a person still belongs to the Party and the people. I can't fight anymore, but production is still my old expertise. I will never lie down and let the public support me."
    In May, after a thorough rain, he carried a hoe and climbed the mountain to reclaim wasteland for production. Before joining the army, he was a well-known and capable man in the village, but now he had lost his legs and his body was not as healthy as before, which added a lot of difficulties to him. However, none of this could shake his determination. He knelt on the mountain with difficulty, hoeing the wasteland bit by bit. In the autumn, the wasteland he reclaimed yielded two large stones of grain.
    In winter, Zhang Shuyi took a sickle and rope and climbed the mountain to cut firewood (jujube branches, used for plowing the land). Thorns tore his clothes and pierced his arms, but he did not lose heart. When returning home, he wrapped the thorny branches in burlap bags and carried them on his back. In one winter, he cut a total of forty-two pieces of firewood (fifty pieces each), sold them for four hundred yuan, and exchanged them for a large stone of grain.

  III. Liangqiangou Becomes a No-Man's Land, Zhang Shuyi Persists in Production and Fighting the Enemy
    In 1942, the enemy built a "fortress" on the top of Wenshan, and Liangqiangou became a no-man's land. The village was reduced to scorched earth, people died or fled, Zhang Shuyi did not die, nor did he flee. He crawled on his hands and knees on the mountain opposite the enemy's stronghold. The two-inch thick pads made of shoe soles tied to his knees were as heavy as shackles. In winter, the sores on his legs were frozen black, and hunger and cold ravaged him even more. His unkempt beard and dirty, black, and thin face made it almost impossible for people to recognize him, but his childlike eyes always shone brightly, and his heart was as hard as a rock. For more than two years, he tirelessly fought hunger, cold, enemies, and wild beasts on this mountain. There was no pessimism or disappointment, only courage and an indomitable heart. He never let go of any opportunity to strike at the enemy.
    On a dark winter night, the pale light from the enemy's "fortress" gun holes, the Japanese's wild laughter mixed with women's cries, could be heard as usual. Zhang Shuyi crawled in a pile of grass in a stone cave, tightly holding a fast sickle, monitoring the enemy. On this night, he was finally discovered on this mountain by a liaison officer of the local troops. From then on, his stone cave became the reconnaissance post of the troops. Reconnaissance personnel often came to him at night. He had combat experience and was good at grasping the enemy's routines, and the reconnaissance situation was also the most accurate.
    He led local troops in many guerrilla fights under the enemy's fortress and won many victories. During the siege of the stronghold, he killed enemy sentries and traitors. Once, he lay on his back on the hilltop and shot down three devils and one traitor with a row of shots. As soon as he crawled and rolled away from the hilltop, enemy shells followed closely, and machine guns fired wildly. In the dark night, he crawled around the enemy's fortresses and in the weeds to bury mines. Once, he led the militia to bury twelve mines. Just as dawn was breaking, he was sleeping when there was a loud bang, and a plume of smoke rose from the foot of the mountain, and people and horses shouted. The next morning, he learned from the civilians who had been captured by the enemy that three devils, two traitors, a foreign dog, and a horse had been killed.
    During the enemy's occupation, his land at the foot of the mountain was not barren. At night, he secretly crawled down the mountain to sow seeds, hung an iron bucket around his neck, crawled to deliver water to water the garden, weeded and planted seedlings. And he always finished the work for the families of revolutionary martyrs before doing his own. In winter he cut firewood on the mountain. When the grass and trees sprouted in the spring, he rubbed his clothes green with wild grass and reclaimed wasteland on the hillside.
    In the autumn, after a year of hard work, he harvested three dan of millet, more than three dan of corn, and one dan and three dou of beans from the mountains and the land below. People exclaimed in surprise: "Zhang Shuyi, this half of a person, has become a god!"

  IV. Resolutely Overcoming Difficulties, Leading the Whole Village to Do a Good Job in Production
    In the spring of 1944, after the failure of the Japanese invaders' policy of nibbling away at the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area, the devils on the fortress withdrew. People returned to the village, with no place to live, little firewood and rice, dejected, and unable to muster the energy to engage in production. He distributed the grain he produced to everyone. He said: "Listen to Chairman Mao's words, we must organize ourselves. As long as there are people, organize production, and we will be able to catch our breath in a year. If there are no houses, what are we worried about if we have people and land!"
    At this most difficult juncture, he unhesitatingly stepped forward, took the lead in leading the whole village, organized production, and overcame all difficulties. In the spring, he invited the village cadres of Shankou Village and Nanbeitanzhuang Village to discuss digging a canal. He said: "In order to have a good harvest this year and grow more grain, I invite you to discuss opening this Blue Canal in our three villages, taking the water from the Ci River, which can irrigate a lot of land."
    This canal had not been opened in the past because Shankou Village was upstream and blocked the water first, and Tanzhuang Village was downstream and often could not get water. Therefore, the village cadres of Tanzhuang Village said they were unwilling. He also invited the district cadres to review the past water use problems and stipulated the water use system for the future, and then the canal started construction. Zhang Shuyi was the general commander of the canal project. He took a ruler and crawled from this end to that end, working like everyone else. People were moved and said: "Zhang Shuyi has no legs and feet and is still working like this. Even if the canal is opened, it won't irrigate an acre of his land, isn't it all for us!"
    The plan was to complete a nine-li-long canal in twenty days, but under his leadership, it was completed in seven days. More than 700 mu of dry land was turned into paddy fields.
    When preventing drought and preparing for famine, the whole village had only four animals for more than 40 hectares of land, and people were worried about not being able to plant it. He was the captain of the village's farming team and couldn't sleep all night, thinking of all kinds of ways to organize all the manpower in the village like a big family. Women dug pits, old men sowed seeds, young and strong men carried water, and children leveled the soil. In six days, they completed the sowing of 245 mu of autumn crops. People happily said: "With Zhang Shuyi here, we are not afraid of any difficulties."
    Difficulties did not exist in front of him. He relied on his two hands to work and produce to make a living, and never asked the village for a grain of food or asked anyone to cultivate for him. He organized his whole family to produce, went up the mountain to cut firewood himself, leaving early and returning late, carrying bundles of eighty or ninety kilograms of firewood on his back, crawling backwards down the mountain. The firewood he cut in one winter could not be burned in a year. He couldn't deliver manure to the fields, so he used cloth bags to carry it to the fields like an animal, carrying eighty or ninety kilograms each time. He hung an iron bucket around his neck and crawled to deliver water to plant six mu of corn. He picked seedlings and weeded, and after weeding his own, he silently went to weed for the families of revolutionary martyrs and widows. He helped people with their livelihood, but refused to let people know. After a year of hard work, he achieved a surplus of one-third after paying the rent.
    In the production campaign, he transformed the lazy people in the village. He often said to the village cadres: "Transforming lazy people cannot be rushed, we must patiently persuade and educate them, and we must first solve the difficulties for the lazy people."
    In order to transform Zhang Qingyuan, the biggest lazy man in the village, he sent two dou of corn to Qingyuan's home when there was a shortage of food, solving his difficulties, and he and the cadres repeatedly persuaded him to join the farming team. Zhang Qingyuan really changed for the better, becoming more and more diligent day by day, and his harvest became stronger year by year. His wife met Zhang Shuyi and said: "You saved my family's life, I really can't repay you, I have to kill a pig to thank you for the New Year."
    He is the village's industry, civil affairs, and families of revolutionary martyrs representative. He is busy all day during the day, and has to go to the village office to work at night. If anyone quarrels and gets angry, he has to go to reconcile them. The villagers call him "the peacemaker."
    In January 1946, he was elected as a labor hero at the production conference in the Ji-Jin District. The Ji-Jin Military Region Headquarters, Political Department, and District Party Committee awarded him the honorary title of "Banner of Revolutionary Martyrs" and issued a notice to the whole Party and army to carry out the Zhang Shuyi Movement.
    Last year, he was again elected as a labor hero by the whole village and participated in the joint labor model conference held by Shijiazhuang City and Shijiazhuang Special Zone. He took a rickshaw to visit the whole city. People were surprised to see this hero who had lost his legs. They couldn't believe that a person who had lost his legs and crawled on the ground could do such earth-shattering things.
    This time he was nominated as a representative to attend the National Conference of Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representatives. (Attached picture)

　　荣军模范——张树义
    辛毅
    张树义今年四十五岁，河北省灵寿县山门口村的一个自然村梁前沟村人。一九四○年以前，他是八路军的一个模范战士，战斗英雄。在与民族敌人——日本帝国主义作战中失掉了双腿；退伍后，积极参加劳动，并领导全村群众生产，又成了人人敬仰的劳动英雄。
  一、坚守阵地，失掉双腿
    张树义出生于一个贫苦的家庭。一家十几口人，靠租种地主周老勤的土地过活。一年辛勤劳动所得除缴给地主四石二斗租外，剩下的只有一些瓜菜，不够半年吃用。民国十六年遭了旱灾，地里没有打下粮食，地主逼着要租，就在十冬腊月里，一家老小，从五间草房里被赶出来。张树义含着眼泪沿门乞讨。就这样在风雪里过了一冬。
    一九三七年，爆发了抗日战争。国民党的军队狼狈南撤，张树义被抓到河南去送夫。这时候，八路军来到灵寿县，领导老百姓抗日，实行减租减息，合理负担。张树义从河南逃回来后，见到家里的光景比以前好过了，他就带着大侄子金山参加了民兵连。
    不久，民兵连升编为聂荣臻将军部下的正规兵团——第四团。张树义便在这个部队里成了一个顶有名的机枪射手。
    一九四○年，龙泉关战斗，他为革命断了两条腿。
    当三四千敌人，向龙泉关进攻的时候，他带领四挺机枪，守卫着前哨山头阵地，为了完成党给他的任务抱着与阵地共存亡的决心，他知道他的阵地失落，将会是整个战斗的失败。
    整整三昼夜，敌人的飞机重炮猛烈地轰击，掩护着步兵无数次的冲锋，最后只剩下张树义一个人和一挺机枪，终于守住了山头阵地。他和他的机枪，打垮了敌人的最后一次冲锋，敌人是失败了。但敌机一阵猛烈的投弹，机枪飞上了天空。当营长率领援兵赶到，把张树义从土坑里拖出来时，他的两条腿已被从膝下炸断了。
  二、“生产还是老行家，绝不躺倒让公家来养活。”
    一九四一年四月，他带着光荣和创伤回了家。从此，他已不能直立行走。可是，这位充满生命力，坚强不屈的共产党员，却并不把自己看成是一个残废人。他常说：“只要我不死，这半截人也是党和人民的，打仗不行啦，生产还是老行家，绝不躺倒让公家养活我。”
    五月里下过透雨，他捎着镢头，爬上山去开荒生产了。未参军前，他是村里有名能干的一条好汉子，可是现在他失去了双腿，身体也没有受伤前那样健康，这都给他增加了不少困难。但是，这些都不能动摇他的决心。他艰难地跪在山上，一镢一镢地开着荒。秋天，他所开的荒地打了两大石粮食。
    冬天，张树义又拿上镰刀、绳子爬上山去砍盖条（枣树枝子，耕地时用），荆棘挂破了衣服，刺穿了手臂，他毫不灰心。回家时，把带刺的条子用毛口袋裹起来，背在背上，就回家来。一冬天共砍了四十二付盖条（每付五十根），卖了四百块钱，换了一大石粮食。
  三、梁前沟变成无人区，张树义坚持生产和对敌斗争
    一九四二年，敌人在文山顶上修了“堡垒”，梁前沟变成了无人区，村庄成了一片焦土，人们死的死了，逃的逃了，张树义没有死，也没有逃，他用双手和膝盖爬行在敌人据点对面的山上。捆在膝盖上二寸厚用鞋底做的垫子，沉重的像付脚镣。冬天腿上的疮伤冻的发黑，饥饿和严寒把他摧残的更衰老了。长年不剃的胡须和积满垢污黑瘦的脸，几乎使人们都不认得他了，但，他童年似的眼睛总是亮晶晶的发着光，他的心像岩石样的硬。整整的两年多他在这座山上不疲倦地和饥寒、敌寇、野兽顽强地斗争着。没有悲观和失望，有的是勇敢和一颗坚强不屈的心，他没有放松过任何可以打击敌人的机会。
    在一个漆黑的冬夜，敌人“堡垒”炮眼里透出惨淡的灯光，日本人的狂笑夹着女人的哭声，照例可以听见。张树义爬在石洞的草堆里，紧握着一把飞快的镰刀，监视着敌人。就在这天晚上，他终于被地方部队通讯员在这座山上发现了，从此他的石洞成了部队的侦察据点。晚上常有侦察员来找他。他有战斗经验，善于掌握敌人规律，侦察情况也最确实。
    他领着地方部队在敌人堡垒下打过多次的游击，得过不少胜利。围困据点斗争中，他打死过敌人哨兵和汉奸，有一次他仰卧在山头上一排枪打倒三个鬼子一个汉奸，当他连爬带滚的刚离开山头，敌人炮弹紧跟着就打来了，机枪疯狂地扫射着。黑夜里他爬行着常常出没在敌人堡垒附近的山坡下和野草丛中埋地雷，有一次带领民兵埋好十二个地雷。东方刚发白的时候，他正在睡觉，轰地一声巨响，一股狼烟从山下升起，人喊马叫。第二天早晨他从被敌人抓去的民夫嘴里知道炸死了三个鬼子、两个汉奸，一条洋狗和一匹马。
    敌人盘据时期，他山下的地没有荒。晚上他偷偷爬下山去播种，把铁桶挂在脖子上爬着送水浇园，锄苗检草。并且他总是先做完抗属的再给自己作。冬天在山上打柴。春天草木发了芽，他用野草把身上的衣服擦成绿色，在山坡上开荒。
    秋天，他一年的辛苦，山上山下收获了三石谷子，三石多玉茭子，一石三斗豆子。人们惊奇地说：“张树义这半截人，真成神啦！”
  四、坚决克服困难，领导全村搞好生产
    一九四四年春天，日寇蚕食晋察冀解放区的政策失败后，堡垒上的鬼子撤走了。人们回到村里，没住处，少柴无米，垂头丧气，提不起劲来闹生产，他把自己生产的粮食分借给大家。他说：“听毛主席的话，咱们要组织起来，只要有人在，组织起来生产，有一年功夫咱们就喘过气来了；房子没有了，有人有地愁什么！”
    在这最困艰的关头，他毫不犹疑的挺身而出，带头领导全村，组织生产，克服了一切困难。春天，他把山门口和南北谭庄的村干部，请到一起商量开渠，他说：“为了今年大生产闹的好，多打粮食，我请你们来商量把咱们三个村的这道蓝渠开开，接过慈河水来，能浇好多地。”
    这道渠过去开不成，原因是山门口在上水，先把水卡住了，谭庄在下水，往往浇不到。因此谭庄村干部表示不肯。他又把区干部请来，检讨了过去的使水毛病，规定今后使水制度，这条渠才算开工了。张树义是渠工总指挥，他拿着尺子从这头爬到那头，和大家一样干，人们感动地说：“人家张树义少腿没脚的还这样干，渠开好浇不上他一亩地，还不是为咱哩！”
    计划二十天完成一道九里长的大渠，在他的领导下，七天就完成了。七百多亩旱田变成了水田。
    在防旱备荒的时候，全村四顷多地只有四头牲口，人们愁着种不上。他是全村的拨工队长，整夜的睡不着，想尽了一切办法把全村所有的人力像一个大家庭一样组织起来，妇女刨坑，老头下种，青壮年担水，儿童平土，六天工夫完成二百四十五亩地大秋作物的播种工作。人们高兴地说：“有张树义在，咱什么困难都不怕。”
    困难在他面前是没有的，他凭着两只手劳动生产过光景，从来不向村里要一粒粮食，或叫人代耕。他把全家组织起来生产，自己上山割柴，早出晚归，八九十斤毛柴捆在背上，倒退着由山上往下爬，一冬割的柴，一年烧不完。粪送不到地里去，用布口袋像牲口似的一回一回的往地里驮，每回驮八九十斤。六亩玉茭子，都是把铁桶挂在脖子上，爬行着送水点种。拣苗锄草，锄了自己的又不声不响地去给抗属孤寡锄。他帮人做了营生，也不肯让人知道。一年的辛苦他做到耕三余一。
    在生产运动中，他改造了村里的懒汉，他常对村干部说：“改造懒汉不能性急，要耐心说服教育，还得先给懒汉解决困难。”
    为了改造村里大懒汉张庆元，在青黄不接的时候，他把二斗玉茭子送到庆元家里，给他解决了困难，又和干部们三番五次苦口婆心地劝他参加拨工组。张庆元果然变好了，一天比一天勤快，收成一年比一年强了，他的老婆碰见张树义就说：“你算救了俺一家的命，真是没法报答，过年可得杀口猪谢你。”
    他是村里的实业、民政、抗属代表，白天忙一天，晚上还得去村公所办公，谁家吵架生气，也要他去和解，村里人们都叫他“和事老人”。
    一九四六年一月，冀晋区生产会上他被选为劳动英雄。冀晋军区司令部、政治部和区党委赠送他“荣军旗帜”这个光荣称号，并通报全党全军开展张树义运动。
    去年他又被全村选为劳动英雄，参加了石家庄市与石家庄专区联合召开的劳模大会。他坐着洋车参观了全市，人们，看见这位失去双腿的英雄，都感到吃惊，想不到一个失去双腿在地下爬着行走的人，竟能作出这样惊天动地的事情。
    这次他又被推选为出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表。（附图片）
