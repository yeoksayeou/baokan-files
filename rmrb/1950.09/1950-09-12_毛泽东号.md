Mao Zedong Locomotive (Medium-length serialized story)
    Twenty-three, Meet more often, criticize and self-criticize more

    Guo Shude worked conscientiously on the train, without being careless or sloppy. After his shift, he would find everyone to chat with, broadly soliciting opinions on all aspects of leadership from work and interpersonal relationships. He also agreed with Wang Qingquan and Yang Daofang to constantly exchange information. …In this way, he quickly figured out the temperaments, personalities, work attitudes, family burdens, ideological situations, and relationships of everyone on the train. One day he said to the two young men:
    "In my opinion, the lack of unity on the train in the past was mainly due to the old hero's poor leadership style, and the section's Representative Zhang, the section chief, and the branch secretary did not provide enough specific assistance to the old hero."
    Wang Qingquan said:
    "Driver Shang is hard to deal with, he has skills, he is very proud, and he looks down on everyone."
    Yang Daofang also said:
    "And Zheng Dugong is very naughty and most opposed to the old hero."
    Guo Shude said:
    "What you said is all correct. But I think Old Shang is still very good. People with skills were always a bit arrogant in the past. It is very important to have good driving skills, and since liberation, he has never had an accident while driving, which is not easy. As long as the old hero changes his leadership style, overcomes some of his own shortcomings first, respects him more, and discusses things with him more, this person will become even better. Let's also set a good example in all aspects for him to see, and it won't be difficult to get along with him."
    "What about Old Zheng?"
    "Old Zheng is the same, we must adopt persuasion and education towards him. He trusts Old Shang, and tries to get close to Old Shang to oppose the old hero; as long as Old Shang changes, he will not dare to be naughty, and will follow suit. However," Guo Shude continued, "don't rush, this is not something that can be done in three or two days. And don't be afraid, if there are any difficulties, the three of us will come up with ideas together to overcome them!"
    Yang Daofang was happy and said:
    "As long as you, Driver Guo, lead well, there will be no mistakes."
    Wang Qingquan also said:
    "Driver Guo, you must give more guidance, when it comes to work, I won't fall behind."
    "Relying on me alone won't work," Guo Shude finally said, "We must meet more often, hold more meetings, and have more criticism and self-criticism, and problems will be solved." (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影作
    二十三、多碰头，多批评多检讨
    郭树德在车上，兢兢业业地工作，不大意不马虎。交班下了车，就找大家去闲谈，从工作上、人事关系上，广泛征求对领导上各方面意见。又和王清权、杨道芳规定好，不断交换情况。……这样，很快就把车上各人的脾气、性格、工作态度、家庭负担、思想情况、相互间关系等等摸的差不多。有一天他对两个青年说：
    “依我看，过去车上不团结，主要是老英雄领导方式不好，段上张代表、段长和支部书记他们，对老英雄的具体帮助不够。”
    王清权道：
    “商大车不好闹，有技术，很骄傲，他谁也看不起。”
    杨道芳也说：
    “还有郑笃恭，很调皮，最反对老英雄。”
    郭树德说：
    “你们说得都不错。不过老商这人我看还很好。有技术的人，在过去的时候总有点自大。开车技术要好，这个很要紧，而且从解放到现在，他开车从来没有出过事故，这就不容易。只要老英雄的领导方法改变一下，先克服自己一些缺点，多尊重他，多和他商量，这个人还会变得更好。我们再在各方面做出好榜样让他看看，对他不难闹好。”
    “老郑呢？”
    “老郑也一样，对他要采取说服教育。他信服老商，尽量靠近老商反对老英雄；只要老商转变了，他就不敢调皮，跟着也就会转变的。不过，”郭树德接着说：“不能着急，这不是三天两天就能做到的事情。也不要害怕，有什么困难，咱们三个共同想法克服它！”
    杨道芳高兴了，说：
    “只要你郭大车好好领导，就出不了错。”
    王清权也说：
    “郭大车，你要多指点指点，要说干活，我是落不了后的。”
    “光靠我一个也不行，”郭树德末了说：“咱们要多碰头，多开会，多批评检讨，有了问题就好解决了。”（附图片）
