Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 1st — Commanders and fighters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army have unanimously protested against the American aircraft's aggressive crimes in Northeast China and have unanimously expressed their determination to defeat the provocations of American imperialism and defend the motherland.

Heroes, models, and meritorious personnel from various units who are attending the Hero and Model Congress have held temporary meetings and written letters of determination, guaranteeing to support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's protests and demands against American imperialism with practical actions. Shooting hero Wei Laiguo said, "Any provocation by American imperialism will not deter the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan and defend peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has the confidence and the strength to defeat any act of aggression by American imperialism!" People's meritorious sailor Zhang Qingxu said, "We are determined to step up preparations and quickly liberate Taiwan and every island in our territorial waters."

Dong Xin, a commander of a certain air force unit, warned American imperialism at a symposium, "China's airspace is not allowed to be violated!" A certain anti-aircraft artillery unit stationed in Shanghai wrote to their superiors expressing their determination, "We must step up our technical improvements to ensure the destruction of any American imperialist aircraft that dares to invade our airspace!" Liu Huchen, a female militia hero from the Subei Military Region, said, "We are determined to strengthen the construction of the militia, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and defeat the aggressive acts of American imperialism."

[This newspaper] The soldiers responsible for guarding the rear are protesting the American aggression with anger.

The entire cadre and soldiers of the Second Company of the Guard Battalion of the Twentieth Army stationed in a certain place were extremely indignant after hearing the news of the American planes invading our Northeast airspace, and immediately held a symposium. Everyone unanimously supported Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and firmly stated: We must respond to the shameless provocations of American imperialism with practical actions, and we are determined to intensify our cultural studies, master technology, and more effectively defend against any aggression by imperialism, to defend the motherland and defend world peace.

Comrade Yang Yonghe of the First Company of the First Battalion of the Third Regiment of the Public Security Force, said to his comrades at the branch reelection meeting of the company: "We are the defenders of the people, we are strong revolutionary soldiers, and we have the responsibility to protect the integrity of our territory and the safety of the people's lives and property. We must wage a ruthless struggle against the evil American imperialism and the Chiang bandit gang!" All comrades at the meeting unanimously stated that they firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest and demands, and will actively participate in the peace signature campaign, and express their determination of support with practical actions in all aspects of study, work, and completion of tasks.

Guo Qiting of the Public Security Bureau of the Ministry of Railways wrote to this newspaper, saying: I am willing to contribute my small strength to drive out the aggression of American imperialism. This provocative and brutal act of the American air force in invading Korea has once again exposed the intention of imperialism to expand the war and undermine world peace to the people. In the future, I must do my job well in my own work post, improve my business skills, and continue to publicize the peace signature movement to the broad masses of people. I have now told my whole family that everyone must sign the peace declaration, and guarantee to follow the example of the peace fighters, so that the anger of the people across the country can be transformed into a huge force to smash this outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger.

Yang Hanxin and Liu Chunde of the Second Company of the Second Battalion of the Guard of the North China Aviation Office jointly wrote to this newspaper: After I read the newspaper report of Foreign Minister Zhou's protest against the United States, I knew that the United States had once again provoked us, and I felt extremely angry. We must resolutely fight him and beat him to a bloody pulp. We must recover this blood debt.
