　　The Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has launched wheat exchange and purchasing simultaneously in eight suburban districts to prevent low wheat prices from harming farmers. From the end of June to the end of July, a total of 769,000 jin was completed by the various district branches within one month. When the wheat first came down, merchants took the opportunity to drive down prices, with the wheat price falling from over 130,000 yuan per shi to 105,000 yuan day by day. After the cooperative purchased the wheat, the price has rebounded and remained at around 130,000 yuan per shi. In addition, the suburban branches of the cooperative, in conjunction with the purchase of wheat, also carried out the collection of agricultural loans, and by the end of July, a total of over 324,000 jin of various agricultural loans equivalent to millet had been recovered.
