How Ma Gensheng Leads the Locomotive Crew

　　Among the railways in the Jiangnan area, the No. 1200 locomotive driven by Ma Gensheng's crew of nine is well-known. Ma Gensheng's crew has surpassed two Class A inspections, safely traveling over 90,300 kilometers. In 450 days, they haven't had a single accident, big or small, creating a new record for the Shanghai Railway Bureau, saving approximately 50,000 catties of rice in repair costs, and saving over 126 tons of coal. How were these achievements attained?

　　The energetic Ma Gensheng had long felt that the Communist Party was good, so after liberation, he was extremely happy and took the lead with great enthusiasm! But one person can't run a train alone, right? He needed others to work with him. Several of the firemen and others working with him weren't as dedicated as he was, and he always felt they were slacking off, which made him unhappy. Later, the railway implemented a responsibility system, with nine people responsible for operating one locomotive. Old Ma thought this new method was excellent. Initially, he saw that one fireman in the group wasn't working hard and got angry, criticizing the fireman for being backward; he was even more dissatisfied with another who liked to sleep in. But because Old Ma took the lead, the performance of No. 1200 was still pretty good. The leadership wanted to cultivate them as a model locomotive crew and coordinated with various parties to assist them, asking them to democratically formulate a labor pact. Old Ma was overjoyed when he learned this and worked even harder. He thought the labor pact method was brilliant, and if it was strict, he wouldn't have to worry about the other eight not putting in effort. If anyone lagged behind, he would use the pact to criticize them. One night, he lay in bed, tossing and turning, thinking about how to formulate the pact. He thought about it all night and came up with ten major articles in his mind. The next day, he wrote them on paper and read them aloud in the group, considering it passed. The drivers and firemen didn't say anything at the time, but they were dissatisfied in their hearts, cursing behind his back, "Damn it! What kind of pact is this?" Afterwards, Old Ma stood in a dominant position, telling everyone to wipe the train and learn simple repairs. The eight people then opposed Old Ma and refused to work properly, which really worried him. The poor Old Ma was helpless and complained to the leadership with a long face. After figuring out the root cause, the leadership told Old Ma, "You need to examine yourself. Your leadership style needs to be democratic!..." These words woke Old Ma up from his dream. After going back, he thought it over and admitted that he had "acute illness and his style wasn't democratic enough," resolving to change.

　　First, he convened a group meeting. Old Ma said painfully about his own shortcomings, reviewing that the previous pact was not democratically formulated and that everyone should reformulate it. The eight people were initially very surprised by Old Ma's self-criticism, even thinking he was going crazy, but seeing his serious demeanor, speaking from the heart, they were moved. Thus, the thought of opposing Old Ma was mostly eliminated. After discussion among the nine people, a democratic pact was formulated. But Old Huang, who liked to sleep in, still didn't get up until late in the morning. Old Ma didn't criticize him, but sincerely and patiently persuaded him frequently. When he saw that he got up early one day, he praised him. In this way, Old Huang stopped sleeping in before long and showed his skills. Old Sheng, who loved to gamble, would sneak out to gamble whenever he had time. He had no energy when he climbed onto the train the next day, and everyone was dissatisfied with him. Old Ma advised him several times, but it didn't have much effect. At one group meeting, everyone severely criticized Old Sheng, and Old Ma persuaded him again, which finally woke him up, vowing never to gamble again.

　　Since Old Huang got up early and Old Sheng stopped gambling, the group was very happy. Others with minor shortcomings also corrected themselves automatically, and the nine hearts gradually merged into one. Group work discussions and review meetings were fixed, and everyone shared joys and hardships, helping each other. Two young men would spend their wages without planning and be poor at the end of the month, which made them emotionally unstable, which could cause problems with the train. Old Ma made plans for them, often calculating their accounts, and everyone laughed at Old Ma for becoming a housekeeper.

　　With the nine people united as one, Old Ma's confidence increased, and he used his brainpower on saving coal. He felt that there were shortcomings in burning coal with a coal engine, with uneven coal spreading. You couldn't sprinkle water when using coal, and pulverized coal would escape from the chimney, which was both unsafe and wasteful. He advocated using manual coal feeding, but the fireman objected, saying, "Manual coal feeding is too much for us to handle." Everyone argued for a long time, and finally decided to try it from Changzhou to Shanghai. As a result, three tons of coal were saved (originally eight tons were used, now only five tons were needed). No one in Ma Gensheng's group had anything to say. Some groups had opinions again: "Damn it, you are showing off. If the leadership wants to seal coal engines, we will all suffer because of you." Later, the Railway Bureau issued coal-saving bonuses, and everyone thought this was good, as it could save coal for the country and earn bonuses, so they all followed No. 1200's example of using manual coal feeding. Just at this time, many locomotives had accidents, running through signals, burning axles, and arriving late, etc., emerged one after another. Old Ma often paid attention to these things, bringing back the materials on why the problems occurred and studying them with everyone to prevent his own locomotive from having problems. Every time the locomotive left the depot, even the main screws were tapped with a small hammer to prevent them from loosening. When the locomotive stopped at a station on the way, as long as there were two or three minutes, the crew members would jump down to check the parts. If it was dark and they couldn't see, they would use their noses to smell the locomotive's odor. When the driver drove the locomotive, he tried to avoid spinning the wheels unnecessarily to avoid unnecessary wear and tear on the wheels. When they arrived at the terminal station, as soon as the crew got off the train, they would either wash and wipe the train or hold a group meeting to review the shortcomings of this trip, or help the maintenance crew with repairs, while also learning technology from them.

　　The contributions of the nine workers are inseparable from the locomotive's nanny - the first maintenance crew. The maintenance workers would climb onto the train at any time, carefully inspect it, and often follow the train voluntarily to conduct on-site inspections of the locomotive's running conditions. When the locomotive was about to reach 90,000 kilometers, the entire crew drove with a more responsible spirit, and the maintenance crew also sent one person to follow the train every day. Under everyone's close cooperation and hard work, they successfully and safely traveled 90,000 kilometers in July for Class A inspection. There were no accidents of any kind in 450 days.

　　马根生怎样领导包乘组
    江南几条铁路上，数马根生包乘组九个人驾驶的一二○○号机车叫得响。马根生包乘组已突破了两个甲检，安全行驶了九万零三百多公里，四百五十天中没出一件大小事故，创造上海铁路局的新纪录，节省检修费约值五万余斤大米，还省煤一百二十六吨多。这些成绩是怎样得来的呢？
    活力充沛的马根生，老早就觉得共产党好，所以一解放，他就非常快活，一股劲带头干！可是一个人总不能开着火车跑呀？要别人配搭。和他联合做工的司炉等，有几个没有像他一样卖力，他老是觉得人家耍滑，肚里不快活。后来铁路实行负责制了，九个人负责包开一台车，老马认为这个新办法很好。起初，他看到组内一个司炉，干活不起劲，就生了气，批评司炉落后；另一个好睡懒觉，他更不满意。但终因老马带头干，一二○○号行车成绩还不错。领导上要培养它成为典型机车、各方配合来协助他们，叫他们自己民主的订立劳动公约。老马知道了这些，快活得了不得，工作格外来劲。心想劳动公约这方法妙，订得严格些，不怕八个人不出力了，谁再落后，我就拿起公约来批评谁。一个晚上，他睡在床上，翻来覆去想着怎样订公约，想了一夜，肚子里有了十大条款，第二天写在纸上，在小组里读了一遍，就算通过了。司机司炉们当时没说话，心里却不满，背后骂着说：“妈的！这算啥公约？”老马以后就站在支配地位，叫大家擦车，学习简单的修检。八个人就和老马对立，不肯好好干，这真把他急坏了。苦得老马毫无办法，哭丧着脸向领导上诉苦，领导上摸出病根后，对老马说：“你得检讨一下，领导作风要民主呀！……”这些话，可把老马从梦中提醒。回去后，自己思来想去，承认自己犯了“急性病，作风不够民主”，抱定决心改。
    首先召开了小组会，老马沉痛的说出自己的毛病，检讨了以前公约订的不民主，要大家重订。八个人对老马的自我检讨，起初感到很突然，还认为他发神经病，但看他那一本正经，一句一句话从心里说出，也就被他感动了。于是，和老马闹蹩扭的心思，就消除了一大半。九个人讨论后，民主公约订出来了。但睡懒觉的老黄，还是日高三丈不起床，老马没有批评他，只是诚恳而耐心的经常劝说他。看他有一天起早了，就表扬他，这样，不久之后老黄也不再睡懒觉了，干活本领都拿出来了。爱赌的老盛，一有空，还溜出去赌钱。第二天爬上车，一点精神都没有，大家对他也不满意，老马劝了他几次，效力不大。一次小组会上，大家狠狠的向老盛提出批评，老马再加劝说，这才醒了过来，发誓决不再赌。
    自从老黄起早，老盛不赌后，组里都很愉快。其他有些小毛病的人，也就自动改好了，九颗心逐渐化合为一颗。小组工作讨论和检讨会固定了，大家甘苦共尝，互相援助。有两个小伙子，工钱发下就无计划的用去，月底闹穷病，情绪不好，这很可能使车子出毛病。老马就替他们做出计划，时常为他们算账，大家笑老马做起管家婆来了。
    九个人扭成一团了，老马的信心提高，就在省煤上用脑筋。他感到用煤引擎烧煤有缺点，撒煤不匀，用煤不能洒水，粉煤要从烟囱里逃出来，既不安全又费煤，他主张用人力投煤，司炉却反对说：“人力投煤，我们吃不消。”大家争论了很久，最后决定由常州开到上海，先试一试，结果就省了三吨煤（原用八吨，现在只需五吨），马根生组里，都没话说了。有些组里意见又来了：“妈的，你们出风头，假使领导上要封煤引擎，大家可被你们害苦了。”后来路局发给省煤奖金，大家认为这样要得，既可替国家省煤，又可拿到奖金，都仿效一二○○号用人力投煤了。正当这时，许多火车头出了事，冒进信号、车辆燃轴与晚点到站等，层出不穷。老马经常注意这些，把所以出毛病的材料弄回来，和大家研究，防止自己的机车出毛病。每次机车出库，连主要螺丝都用小榔头敲过，不使有点松动，机车在中途停站时，只要有二、三分钟的时间，乘务员都要跳下来检查机件，如果是黑夜看不到，他们就用鼻子嗅机车的气味。司机驾着火车头时，竭力避免空转，以免车轮作不必要的磨损。到了终点站，几个人一下车，不是洗擦车子，就是开小组会，检讨这次行车时的缺点，或者帮包修组忙，检修车子，同时也跟他们学了技术。
    九个工人的功劳与机车的保姆——第一包修组——是不可分的。包修工友们，随时爬上车子，细心的查看，常义务的跟车子跑，实地考察机车行走情形。当机车快跑到九万公里时，全体乘务员以更加负责的精神来驾驶，包修组也每天派一人跟车，在大家密切合作奋勉下，七月里胜利的安全行走九万甲检公里。四百五十天没出任何事故。
