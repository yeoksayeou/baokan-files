　　Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from TASS and Telepress on the 26th: The Communist Party of Great Britain held a celebration in London's Empress Hall on September 24th to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the CPGB. The event was attended by 9,000 people, and the theme of the meeting was to strive for peace. CPGB General Secretary Pollitt issued a call at the meeting, demanding an understanding between Britain and the Soviet Union to defeat the attempt by U.S. imperialists to plunge the world into a third world war. This call aroused thunderous applause from the masses.
    
    In his speech, Pollitt called on the British people to make every possible effort to overthrow the disastrous policies currently being implemented by the Labour government. He said: The Communist Party of Great Britain calls on all British working people to unite and oppose the extension of conscription, to strive for the withdrawal of British troops from Malaya and Korea back to the country; to strive for the People's Republic of China to join the United Nations; and to strive for Britain to begin new trade negotiations with the Soviet Union, the people's democracies, and China.
    
    Amidst continuous applause, Pollitt continued: The Soviet Union, through its representative to the United Nations, has already put forward the only proposal that can deal with the threat of atomic bombs. If these proposals can be adopted, the threat of war can be eliminated and peace ensured. Pollitt finally called on all workers to pay attention to the fact that "the current attacks and threats against the Party are closely related to them, and the hidden purpose behind them is to lower the living standards of the entire working class."
    
    The meeting read out congratulatory telegrams from the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries. The audience responded with warm applause. The meeting also passed a tribute telegram to Stalin in a warm and enthusiastic atmosphere.
    
    At the celebration, two hundred and fifty-three people applied for membership in the Party.

　　英国共产党成立三十周年
    伦敦九千人举行庆祝大会
    波立特号召击败美帝发动世界大战的企图
    【新华社二十六日讯】综合塔斯社电通社消息：英国共产党于九月二十四日在伦敦女皇大厦举行了纪念英共成立三十周年纪念的庆祝大会。参加者达九千人，大会的主题是争取和平。英共总书记波立特在会上发出号召，要求取得英苏之间的谅解，以击败美国帝国主义者把世界投入第三次大战的企图。这一号召引起了广大群众雷动的掌声。
    波立特在演说中号召英国人民尽一切可能的努力，以推翻目前工党政府所施行的灾难性政策。他说：英国共产党号召全体英国劳动人民团结一起，进行反对延长兵役期限，争取把马来亚及朝鲜的英军撤退回国；争取使中华人民共和国加入联合国；并争取英国与苏联、各人民民主国家及中国开始新的贸易谈判。
    波立特在不断的掌声中继续说：苏联已经由其驻联合国的代表提出唯一可以对付原子弹威胁的提案，如果这些提案能够通过，就可以消除战争的威胁，并确保和平。波立特最后号召全体工人注意“党目前受到的攻击和威胁是与他们休戚相关的，它后面隐藏着的目的就是要降低整个工人阶级的生活水准”。
    大会宣读了苏联、中国与其他各国共产党和工人党的贺电。会众报以热烈的掌声。大会也在热情洋溢中通过了给斯大林的致敬电。
    在庆祝会上有二百五十三个人提出要求入党的申请。
