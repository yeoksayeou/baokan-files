Xinhua News Agency, London, 3rd: Reuter reports: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on August 28 regarding British foreign policy. The statement said: In the current urgent situation, the greatest responsibility of the British working class is to defend peace and national independence, and defeat the deadly policy of the right-wing Labor leaders who have reduced Britain to an appendage of American imperialism. The statement opposes the government's policy of expanding armaments and extending the term of military service at the expense of the people's living standards, and demands the abandonment of the wage freeze policy and reduction of prices. The statement points out that the United States is using the criminal attack on Korea to brew a world war in order to consolidate its tottering colonial rule in Southeast Asia and win world hegemony for American big business.

　　The statement rebukes the Labor Party's support for this policy at home. The statement points out: Because of this, big business and the Conservative Party have become stronger. In the next general election, the Conservative Party hopes to win in an atmosphere of war hysteria. The statement said: In order to prevent the Conservative Party from winning the next general election, and to ensure the victory of the working class, the Communist Party will only put forward a limited number of candidates, and in other constituencies, will advise workers to vote for Labor candidates. At the same time, the Communist Party will urge workers to fight for new and genuine socialist policies and against the reactionary policies of the right-wing Labor Party. The statement calls on workers to "rise up now to fight for the selection of Labor candidates who advocate a policy of peace and defend the interests of the working class."

　　The statement points out that the forces for peace are stronger than the forces for war, "If we, the British people, unite, peace can be guaranteed." The statement concludes: "Although the danger is great, the British labor movement and all member states of the World Peace Congress can still save peace. Peace can and must be maintained."

　　英共发表严正声明
    号召保卫和平与民族独立斥责英政府反动外交政策
    【新华社三日讯】电通社伦敦讯：英国共产党执行委员会于八月二十八日发表关于英国外交政策的声明。声明称：在当前紧急的局势中，英国工人阶级的最大责任是保卫和平与民族独立，击败右翼工党领袖们的使英国沦为美国帝国主义附庸的致命政策。该声明反对政府以人民的生活水准为牺牲品的扩张军备和延长兵役期限的政策，并要求放弃工资冻结政策及减低物价。声明指出：美国正在利用对朝鲜的罪恶攻击，酝酿世界大战，以巩固东南亚摇摇欲坠的殖民统治，为美国大商业争取世界霸权。
    声明斥责工党在国内对这一政策的支持。声明指出：由于这样，大商业和保守党变得强大起来了。在下一次大选中，保守党希图在一种战争歇斯底里的气氛中取得胜利。声明说：为了不使保守党在下次大选中获胜，为了保证工人阶级的胜利，共产党将仅仅提出有限的候选人，在其他选区，将建议工人们投工党候选人的票。同时，共产党将敦促工人们进行斗争，争取新的真正的社会主义政策，反对右翼工党的反动政策。声明号召工人们“现在就起来斗争，争取选定那些主张采取和平政策及保卫工人阶级利益的工党候选人”。
    声明指出：拥护和平的力量比战争力量强大，“假如我们英国人民团结一致，和平是可以保证的。”声明最后说：“虽然危险很大，但英国工人运动及世界和平大会的全体成员国仍然能够拯救和平。和平是能够而且必须保持的。”
