Due to Lack of Organization and Leadership
    Northeast Railway Bureau Rectification Meeting Not Well Held
    Important Problems Not Correctly Resolved
    [This Newspaper News] The Northeast Railway Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a rectification meeting for the main responsible cadres of the various bureaus and old cadres above the section chief level of the organs from August 11th to 15th. This meeting, due to the lack of sufficient preparation beforehand, especially in the steps and methods of checking work, did not first have the leading cadres address the key issues in the work, grasp several basic policies, and conduct prepared and analyzed self-criticism, then hand it over to everyone for discussion; instead, in the absence of clear requirements and sufficient preparation from the leadership, it adopted the method of first developing democracy from below to raise problems to be solved. Therefore, although many problems were exposed at the meeting, and it also involved major issues in the work such as "implementing economic accounting system" and "continuing to earnestly learn from Soviet experience," the entire meeting showed a lack of leadership and organization, so the result was very poor. Cadres who had committed serious mistakes did not examine their own errors, but instead made many opinions dissatisfied with the Party at the meeting; cadres who did not obey the work assignments did not examine their own organizational concepts, but could accuse the leadership of not listening to their opinions in assigning work at the meeting. And these people were given the opportunity to speak first. On the other hand, those who could put forward important opinions on the work were limited by time and stopped from speaking. Therefore, some cadres reflected: "Can't get to the point!" Although the leading comrades finally mobilized to discuss economic accounting and how to learn from the Soviet Union, there were still no good results.
    The following problems were exposed at the meeting: (1) Some cadres were complacent and conservative, emphasizing their own experience, and refused to learn from the Soviet Union under the pretext of "learning from Soviet experience should be combined with reality." The chief of the transportation department is one example. Soviet comrades had invited him several times to study the new shunting method, but he said: "Our old China has had it for a long time." And complained to the superiors: "Not paying attention to Chinese experience." (2) In terms of economic accounting, there were serious waste phenomena in the use of materials, procurement, engineering design, and repairs; because of the lack of quota management and large budgets, the country suffered great losses. (3) In terms of ideological style, there was a serious complacency, and a lack of self-criticism. Some people always used "the situation is not comprehensive" and "not 100% correct" as excuses when criticized, and did not conduct self-examination. There were many disunities and disputes among cadres and between upper and lower departments. In addition, in dealing with cadre issues, the Party committee could not uniformly deploy cadres. In the use of cadres, it either did not pay attention to political conditions at all, or only paid attention to political conditions and not work ability. There was a lack of serious and timely handling of cadres who made mistakes. The Party, government, labor union, and youth league did not work in a consistent pace and each did its own thing, etc. Due to the lack of leadership and organization at the meeting, these problems, especially the problem of learning from the Soviet Union, were not correctly resolved.
    (Editor's note: During this rectification movement, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee successively sent working groups to various places to understand the rectification situation. This news was written based on the report materials of the rectification meeting of the Northeast Railway Party Committee. Although this meeting was held in mid-August, some newspapers reported it at the time. However, it was not pointed out in this report that this rectification meeting had some shortcomings and errors. And these shortcomings and errors are exactly what should be paid attention to when holding rectification meetings in various places. Therefore, it is published for reference in various places.)

　　缺乏组织缺乏领导
    东北铁路局整风会议没开好
    重要问题并未得到正确解决
    【本报讯】中共东北铁路党委会，曾于八月十一日至十五日，召开了各管理局党、政、工、团主要负责干部及机关科长以上老干部整风会议。这个会议，由于事前缺乏充分的准备，特别是在检查工作的步骤与方法上，不是先由领导干部针对着工作中的关键问题，掌握几个基本政策有准备有分析地加以检讨综合后，再交给大家讨论；而是在领导上缺乏明确要求与充分准备的情况下，采用先从下边发扬民主提出问题来解决的办法。因而会上虽然暴露了不少问题，也涉及到“贯彻经济核算制”及“继续切实学习苏联经验”等工作中的主要问题。但整个会议是表现着是缺乏领导缺乏组织的，因此结果很不好。曾犯有严重错误的干部，不检讨自己错误，而是在会上大发表其对党不满的意见；不服从工作分配的干部，不检讨自己的组织观念，而在会上可以指责领导不听取自己意见分配工作。并且这些人都被得到首先发言的机会。另一方面对工作能够提出重要意见的，反为时间所限，而被停止发言。因此有的干部反映：“摸不着边啦！”虽然最后领导同志动员讨论经济核算及如何向苏联学习，但仍无好的结果。
    在会议上暴露了以下几个问题：（一）部分干部自满保守，强调自己经验，借“学习苏联经验要与实际相结合”而拒绝向苏联学习。车务部长即是一例，苏联同志曾几次邀请他去研究新的调车法，但他说：“我们老中华国早就有了”。并且埋怨上级：“不重视中国经验。”（二）经济核算方面，在材料使用、采购、工程设计、修理中都有严重浪费现象；因为缺乏定额管理，做大预算，使国家损失很大。（三）在思想作风上，存在着严重的骄傲自满情绪，缺乏自我批评的空气。有的人被批评时总以“情况不全面”、“不够百分之百的正确”为借口，不进行自我检讨。在干部间、上下部门间闹不团结，纠纷颇多。此外在处理干部问题上，党委不能统一调配干部。在使用干部上，不是根本不注意政治条件，就是只注意政治条件而不注意工作能力。对犯错误的干部缺乏严肃及时的处理。党、政、工、团在工作上步调不够一致，各搞一套等等。由于会议缺乏领导缺乏组织，这些问题，特别是向苏联学习等问题，就未得到正确解决。
    （编者按：中共中央东北局在这次整风运动中，曾先后派出工作组分赴各地了解整风情况。这消息就是根据参加东北铁路党委会整风会议的汇报材料写成的。虽然这个会议是八月中旬召开的，当时个别报纸也作了报道。但并未如这个汇报所指出的，这个整风会议，是存在一些缺点和错误的。而这些缺点与错误，正是各地召开整风会议时所应当注意的。故予以发表，供各地参考。）
