　　Wang Debiao Leads Wangjiaping
    Li Wen
    The era of Chinese peasants being "a sheet of loose sand" is over. If there are still people who underestimate the awareness of Chinese peasants and the power of organization, let them take a look at Wangjiaping in Suide County, Northern Shaanxi!
    In 1947, when the Hu Zongnan bandit army was at the height of its arrogance in attacking the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, burning, killing, looting, and raping women everywhere; this did not scare the people of Northern Shaanxi. When the bandit army scurried to Wangjiaping on July 12, there was not a single person in the entire village. Every cave dwelling was empty. There were no pots. Only piles of ashes remained. The bandit soldiers burned down doors and windows, smashed the tops of the cave dwellings, and dug through almost all of the main road near the village. They still could not find a single grain of food, a blanket, or an item of clothing. It was dark, and although no gunshots were heard, the unyielding village made the bandit army dare not sleep peacefully, gnawing on raw melons out of hunger. The bandit army did not dare to stay long and scurried back to Suide City the next day.
    Wangjiaping is more than a hundred li away from the county seat. After the bandit army scurried away, Wang Debiao returned to the village and told the villagers hiding outside about the bestial behavior of the bandit army he had witnessed. The villagers gritted their teeth and said, "We'll rot the grain rather than let the Hu bandits eat it. We'll rot the clothes rather than let the Hu bandits steal them." "Our army has gone to fight on the outer lines. The Hu bandit army will eventually be wiped out." They also discussed the experiences and lessons learned from the "clearing the fields" (i.e., hiding supplies) in villages occupied by the bandits. They took out the grain and clothing hidden on the roofs of the cave dwellings and near the village, moved them to the fields more than ten li away, buried them well, covered them with soil, and planted crops on top. Village cadres divided the work and led the preparations for war. In case of emergencies, Wang Yingfa, Wang Zengyao, and others organized the women and children to evacuate: one person solved the accommodation problem, one person supplied food and drink, and one person acted as a "guide"; Wang Debiao led the young and strong militiamen as the rearguard, covering the retreat. Villages were in contact with each other, and news was transmitted from village to village as soon as there was enemy activity. Therefore, when the bandit army set out from Suide County on the 11th and scurried to Wangjiaping the next morning, the people had already evacuated before dawn.
    When the People's Liberation Army switched to the counter-offensive and the Hu bandits began to collapse, Wang Debiao once again led the entire village to join the upsurge of supporting the front and supporting the army. They took out grain from the cellars. There were too few pack animals to carry the grain. Teenagers and old men in their fifties and sixties carried dozens of kilograms at a time and rushed to the front line three hundred li away to send them to their own troops.
    The people of Wangjiaping have such strong hatred and love, which is not accidental: Wangjiaping used to be a poor mountain village with thin soil and many stones. The entire village of thirty households cultivated more than 1,200 mu of land, more than 900 mu of which were rented from landlords in other villages; many people owed debts that they could not repay and could not afford grain and rice, relying only on sweet potatoes and melon vegetables to make a living. In 1940, General Wang Zhen drove away the reactionary leader He Shaonan, and a new regime was established. In the rent reduction and interest reduction democratic reform movement, land gradually passed into the hands of the peasants, and the enthusiasm for production was greatly increased. After the great production movement after 1943, cooperation and mutual assistance were developed, farming methods were improved, and the area of cultivated land was expanded. Public granaries and schools were also established. The life of the entire village rapidly improved. In 1946, before the Hu bandits attacked, the village had already achieved a well-fed and well-clothed life. The entire village could harvest more than 340 shi of coarse grains (the income of farmers before the revolution was less than 100 shi), and ordinary farmers not only did not eat chaff vegetables but also had surplus grain. When their comfortable life was destroyed, it aroused their strong resistance.
    The victory of the "clearing the fields" struggle gave Wangjiaping better conditions for healing the wounds of war, but there were many difficulties. The number of livestock was reduced. Of the fourteen donkeys in the village, only two remained. Due to the disturbance of the Hu bandits, the farming was rough and not on time, and the yield of each mu of crops was reduced by more than half. Wang Debiao timely encouraged everyone: "Now that the Hu bandits are gone, we must work harder to produce, make up for the losses of 1947, and restore the production level of 1946." Wang Debiao and activists Wang Jizhou and others studied the situation in the village. The first difficulty to be solved was to increase the number of livestock. However, many people were still worried that buying livestock would increase the burden of supporting the front. He then convened a mass meeting to discuss and stipulate the method of encouraging the purchase of livestock. Wang Debiao himself took the lead in buying a large donkey with others. He knew that Wang Changyan wanted to buy half a cow, and seeing that Changyan and Wang Ji'an got along well, he said to Ji'an: "You have difficulty buying a livestock, and Changyan also wants to buy half a cow. Would it be good for you two to partner up?" Under the leadership and specific organization of Wang Debiao, the entire village added four cows and five donkeys in one year. Debiao also led the discussion on various methods of preventing famine, such as planting summer vegetables, planning to plant 426 mu of summer fields, and using children to plant, which would save more than two shi of black beans compared to sowing. Wang Debiao's mutual aid group made a specific production plan and helped other groups calculate how to exchange labor for farming, extract labor to work short-term jobs, engage in transportation, and increase sideline income. From February 9 to March 28, 1948, in a month and a half, Wang Debiao's group earned 1.9 million yuan (Northwest Farmer Currency), and some groups earned 2 million yuan. At the end of 1948, summarizing the production work, Wangjiaping sowed 1,212 mu of millet, sorghum, and other crops, and planted an additional 171 mu of hemp and 123 mu of potatoes, achieving universal hoeing three times and plowing and harrowing the autumn land twice. The processing of farming increased the yield from an average of less than three dou per mu to six dou, basically restoring the production level before the Hu bandits attacked the border area in 1946.
    With the recovery of production, Wangjiaping, which had once suffered disasters and setbacks, is now booming again. The women's weaving cooperative has been restored. Flowers are bought cheaply, and cloth is sold conveniently. Saving time, women's weaving enthusiasm is even higher. There is a woman named Xu Yulan. In 1949, she and her mother-in-law spun 100 jin of yarn and wove 180 zhang of cloth. The five members of the family put on new clothes and bought a plow cattle. In the year the Hu bandit army was driven away, many people in Wangjiaping developed malaria. Wang Debiao established a medical cooperative and sent people to the county medical supply to buy a batch of special medicines for treating malaria and stomach aches. People saw that the medicines were effective in treating diseases and no longer sought gods and worshiped medicines, reducing the suffering of the masses. The school has also been restored. Elementary school students are active inside and outside the school. Every day, they take literacy cards home and teach their older brothers, sisters-in-law, and mothers to learn useful words such as "spinning wheel" and "cotton." Wang Laiqi, fourteen years old, taught his sister-in-law Gao Xiuying, teaching seriously and learning quickly. In less than half a month, Xiuying recognized dozens of characters, could write her own name, and learned to use the abacus. (Attached picture)

　　王德彪领导的王家坪
    力文
    中国农民“一盘散沙”的时代已经过去了。如果还有人过低估计中国农民的觉悟和组织起来的力量，就让他看看陕北绥德县王家坪吧！
    一九四七年，胡宗南匪军进攻陕甘宁边区的气焰正高，到处烧杀抢掠，奸淫妇女；这并没有吓倒陕北人民。当七月十二日匪军窜到王家坪的时候，全村看不到一个人影，每个窑洞都空空的，锅也没有了，只剩下一堆残灰。匪兵们烧毁门窗，捣烂窑顶，村边的大路几乎掘遍了，依然没有搜索到一粒粮食，一条被子和一件衣服。天黑了，虽然还没听到枪声，不屈的村庄，却使得匪军不敢安然睡觉，饥饿得啃着生瓜。匪军没敢多逗留，第二天便窜回绥德城了。
    王家坪距县城百余里。匪军窜走后，王德彪回村把亲眼看见的匪军兽性行为，告诉隐避在外的村民，村民咬紧牙说：“粮食沤了不让胡匪吃，衣裳沤了，不让胡匪抢走。”“咱们的军队外线作战去了，胡匪军总会被消灭的。”他们还讨论了匪占村庄“坚壁清野”（即掩藏物资）的经验教训，取出隐藏在窑顶上和村附近的粮食、衣服，转移到离村十多里的地里，埋藏好，撒上土，再种上庄稼。村干部分工领导备战。发生情况时，王应法、王曾耀等三人组织婆姨娃娃转移：一个人解决住宿问题，一个人供给吃喝，一个人当“路引”；王德彪领导着年轻力壮的民兵当后卫，掩护撤退。村与村之间都取上联系，一有敌情，村村传送消息。所以，匪军十一日从绥德县城出发，次日上午窜到王家坪的时候，人们早已在拂晓前便转移了。
    当解放军转入反攻，胡匪开始溃退的时候，王德彪又领导全村人民卷入支前拥军的热潮中了。他们从地窖中取出粮食，驮粮的牲口少，十几岁的孩子，五六十岁的老汉，一次背上几十斤，赶到三百里以外的前线，送给自己的队伍。
    王家坪人民有着如此强烈的憎和爱，不是偶然的：王家坪过去本是地薄石多的穷苦山庄，全村三十户人家，种着一千二百多亩地，有九百多亩是租自外村地主的；很多人欠着还不清的账，吃不上粮米，只是靠山药蛋、瓜菜糊口。一九四○年王震将军赶走了反动头子何绍南，新的政权建立了，在减租减息民主改革运动中，土地渐渐转到农民手中，生产情绪大为提高，又经过一九四三年以后的大生产运动，发展合作互助，改进耕作方法，扩大耕地面积，还创办了义仓和学校。全村生活迅速上升。胡匪进攻以前的一九四六年，已达到丰衣足食的地步。全村可收粗粮三百四十余石（革命前农民收入不足百石），一般农户，不仅不吃糠菜，还有余粮。当他们的安乐生活遭到破坏的时候，便激起他们的强烈反抗。
    “坚壁清野”斗争的胜利，使王家坪医治战争创伤，有着较好的条件，但困难是很多的。牲口减少了，全村十四头驴，只剩下两头。由于胡匪扰乱，耕作粗糙不按时，每亩作物产量降低一半以上。王德彪及时的鼓励大家：“现下胡匪走了，要加劲生产，补上一九四七年的损失，恢复一九四六年生产水平。”王德彪和积极分子王继周等研究村中情况，首先要解决的困难是增添牲口。可是，不少人还耽心买了牲口会加重支前负担，他便召开群众会，讨论和规定出鼓励买牲口的出差办法。王德彪自己先和别人伙买了一个大驴，他知道王常延想买半个牛，又看到常延和王继庵两家合得来，便对继庵说：“你买一个牲口有困难，常延也想买半个牛，你俩合伙好吗？”在王德彪带头影响和具体组织下，一年中全村便添了四头牛、五个驴。德彪又领导讨论了多种夏菜等防荒办法，计划种夏田四百二十六亩，用娃娃点种，点种比撒种节省黑豆两石多。王德彪互助组作出具体生产计划，又帮助其他组，计算怎样变工耕作，抽出劳力打短工，搞运输，增加副业收入。从一九四八年二月九日到三月二十八日，个半月的光景，王德彪组挣工赚洋一百九十万元（西北农民币），有的组挣到二百万元。一九四八年底总结生产工作，王家坪播种谷子、高粱等一千二百一十二亩，另外种麻子一百七十一亩，洋芋一百二十三亩，做到普遍锄三遍，二分之一的秋地犁耙两次。耕作的加工使每亩平均不到三斗的产量增至六斗，基本上恢复了一九四六年胡匪进攻边区以前的生产水平。
    随着生产的恢复，一度遭受灾难与挫折的王家坪，又在蒸蒸日上了。妇女纺织合作社恢复了，花买得贱，布卖得方便，省出了工夫，妇女纺织情绪更高了。有个妇女叫徐玉兰，一九四九年和婆婆两个人，纺线一百斤，织成一百八十丈布，一家五口人换上了新衣裳，还买到一个耕牛。赶走胡匪军的那年，王家坪发疟子的人很多，王德彪筹办了医药合作社，派人到县医药社买回一批治疟疾、肚子疼的特效药。人们见药品治病有效，不再求神拜药了，减少了群众的痛苦。学校也恢复了，小学生在校内外活跃起来，每天带着识字牌回家，教自己的哥嫂、妈妈，学会“纺车”“棉花”等应用生字。十四岁的王来起教他嫂高秀英，教的认真，学的灵敏，不到半月工夫，秀英认到几十个生字，自己的名字会写了，还学会打算盘。（附图片）
