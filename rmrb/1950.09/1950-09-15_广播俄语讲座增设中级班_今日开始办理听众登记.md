　　Broadcast Russian Language Lectures Add Intermediate Class
　　Listener Registration Begins Today
　　The first series of broadcast Russian language lectures, jointly organized by the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, started on December 5th of last year and concluded at the end of August this year. In response to the requests of the majority of Friendship Association members and listeners, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station have decided to add an intermediate class starting from the second series, in addition to continuing the beginner's class. Both classes will be taught by Mr. Gong Renfang, and it has been decided to expand the existing tutorial groups that assist listeners in learning Russian and broaden the scope of tutoring.

　　The curriculum of the second series of broadcast Russian language beginner's class will be roughly the same as the first series. Lectures will be given four times a week, one hour each time. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday are evening classes, while Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday are morning classes. The intermediate class curriculum, in principle, will be a step up from the first series of beginner's class. Lectures will be given twice a week, one hour each time, divided into morning and evening classes. Tuesday and Thursday are evening classes, while Wednesday and Friday are morning classes. The preliminary schedule for the morning and evening lectures for the intermediate and beginner's classes is: morning classes from 6:00 to 7:00 AM (or 6:00 to 7:30 AM), and evening classes from 7:00 to 8:00 PM.

　　The broadcast Russian language lectures have decided to start listener registration from September 15th and close on September 30th. All those who plan to participate in the learning can register during this period according to the registration methods below.

　　(1) Registration offices: Branch associations of all levels under the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association (registration forms and registration certificates have been issued to the branch associations of all levels of the Friendship Association; smaller branch associations may not have received them. If there are learners in such units, the branch association of the Friendship Association can send someone to No. 2 Yuhe Bridge, Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, to collect the registration form and registration certificate.) or Beijing People's Broadcasting Station (No. 3 West Chang'an Street).

　　(2) Registration procedures: Register in person at the Friendship Association branch association or at the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station. In addition, you can also send a letter with sufficient return postage to the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association or the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station to register.

　　(3) After registration, you can purchase broadcast Russian language lecture materials at preferential rates (the date of sale and specific preferential measures will be announced separately); you can participate in the broadcast Russian language lecture listener get-togethers or other activities with priority; you can request tutorial assistance with priority (tutorial methods will be announced separately).

　　(4) Matters needing attention: According to past experience, group learning is the best learning method. All organizations, groups, schools, or listeners living nearby should actively organize themselves for group learning as much as possible. This will make it easier to request tutoring or mutual assistance. The person in charge of the study group in the group learning unit can list the number of participants in the group and fill out the registration form clearly at the Friendship Association at all levels.

　　广播俄语讲座增设中级班
    今日开始办理听众登记
    北京市中苏友好协会与北京市人民广播电台合办的第一期广播俄语讲座，从去年十二月五日开始到今年八月底已全部结束。根据广大友协会员和听众的要求，北京市中苏友好协会与京市人民电台决定从第二期开始，除续办初级班外，再增设中级班。两班都由龚人放先生担任讲授，并决定扩大原有辅助听众学习俄文的助学会组织及助学范围。
    第二期广播俄语讲座初级班的课程大致和第一期相同。每周讲课四次，每次一小时。星期一、三、五是晚班，二、四、六是早班。中级班课程原则上是根据第一期初级班的课程提高一步。每周讲课二次，每次一小时，分早晚班，星期二、四是晚班，星期三、五是早班。中级班和初级班的早晚讲课时间初步决定：早班是六点到七点（或六点到七点半），晚班是下午七点到八点。
    广播俄语讲座决定在九月十五日起开始听众登记，到九月三十日截止。所有准备参加学习的人都可在这时期内根据下面的登记办法办理登记。
    （一）登记机关：北京市中苏友好协会所属各级支会（登记表和登记证都已发给各级友协支会，较小的友协支会可能没有发到，如果此种单位有学习者，可由该友协支会派人前往御河桥二号北京市中苏友好协会领取登记表和登记证。）或北京市人民广播电台（西长安街三号）。
    （二）登记手续：亲自在该友协支会或到京市人民电台登记。此外并可用附足回信邮票的信寄给北京市中苏友协宣传部，或北京市人民广播电台办理登记。
    （三）登记后可按优待办法购买广播俄语讲座教材（发卖日期和具体优待办法另行公布）；优先参加广播俄语讲座听众联欢会或其它活动；优先要求助学会助学（助学办法另行公布）。
    （四）注意事项：按过去的经验，集体学习是最好的学习方法，各机关、团体、学校或居住较近的听众应尽可能主动地组织起来集体学习，这样要求助学或互助都方便。集体学习单位可以由学习小组负责人将本组参加学习人数开列名单，到友协各级支会，依照登记表格填写清楚。（陈应楠）
