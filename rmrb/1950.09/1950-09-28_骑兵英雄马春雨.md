　　Cavalry Hero Ma Chunyu
    Mu Lin
    Comrade Ma Chunyu is the deputy political instructor of the Second Company of a certain unit of the Northeast Military Region. He is an outstanding combat hero who has been awarded two special merits, three combat hero medals, one first-class certificate, and nine material rewards. He was born into a tenant farmer's family in Chifeng County, Rehe Province. He begged for food for half a year, herded pigs for a landlord at the age of twelve, and worked as a short-term laborer from the age of thirteen. He joined the People's Liberation Army at the age of twenty-seven, joined the Chinese Communist Party at the age of twenty-eight, and is thirty-two years old this year.
  The Battle to Seize the Hilltop
    In November 1947, Chiang Kai-shek's 92nd Army, 21st Division and 94th Army, 43rd Division, advanced towards Chaoyang. The task of our cavalry division was to insert itself into the enemy's rear and intercept them when they retreated. At that time, Comrade Ma Chunyu was the deputy platoon leader. On the morning of the second day after the start of the battle, the hilltop occupied by our army was captured by enemy reinforcements from Yixian City. The regimental commander ordered the Second Company to resolutely retake the hilltop. Comrade Ma Chunyu, leading three soldiers, charged to the front, braving the enemy's seven or eight machine guns and two 60mm mortars, killing more than twenty enemies and completing the task of retaking the hilltop.
    At this time, the enemy had begun to retreat, and the leading enemy force used a battalion of troops to rush towards our army's position, attempting to open a retreat route. The position of a certain company of our unit was also captured by the enemy. In order to control this road and annihilate the fleeing enemy, the Second Company launched a fierce battle to seize the hilltop. Ma Chunyu, holding his gun like a tiger, charged fiercely, regardless of the artillery shells covering him in dirt, regardless of the bullets flying past him, and regardless of the low-altitude strafing by two planes overhead. Finally, Comrade Ma Chunyu was the first to seize the top of the hill. At this time, the enemy also rushed to about twenty meters from the top of the hill. He stood on the mountain and opened fire on the enemy below, killing five or six enemies. He repelled the enemy, and the entire company followed up, occupied the hilltop, and compressed the enemy on the sandy beach of the Daling River. At this time, our pursuing troops also closely followed from behind. The enemy was attacked from both ends, collapsed, and five or six hundred people were drowned and killed in our pincer attack, and the rest all laid down their weapons.
    After this battle, there followed two days and nights of rapid marching to intercept the enemy's 174th Division fleeing from Yixian County. Comrade Ma Chunyu's platoon served as the vanguard platoon. When they arrived at Yujiazhuang, they encountered the enemy's vanguard platoon, and the two sides immediately engaged in battle. Comrade Ma Chunyu, taking advantage of the moment when an enemy machine gunner was changing ammunition, jumped on his horse and charged into the enemy ranks, slashing at him with his saber; the enemy machine gunner dodged, and he conveniently seized the machine gun and swept it from his horse, killing the enemy in panic and seizing the guns of this enemy platoon, blocking the enemy's retreat. The entire regiment, taking advantage of the enemy's crowding together on the narrow road and unable to deploy their forces, launched an encirclement, annihilating an entire enemy division in just one hour.
  The Achievements of Six People
    In May 1948, Chiang Kai-shek's 13th Army, entrenched in Chengde, prepared to flee. Our cavalry division blocked the enemy at Yingfang, between Luanping and Chengde. At dawn, the First and Second Companies opened fire on the enemy running from Luanping. When attacking Sandao Ridge, because the mountain ridge was too high, it was not easy for horses to go up, so Comrade Ma Chunyu dismounted and led six comrades to charge to the front. After they killed more than twenty enemies, they ran out of bullets. Ma Chunyu mobilized everyone, saying, "The Communist Party's troops, if they don't have bullets, they go and seize them from the enemy's hands!" Under his encouragement, the six people charged forward bravely with hand grenades. When they reached the middle of the mountain, they captured four American-made rifles from the enemy. After occupying Sandao Ridge, they attacked Sidao Ridge and Wudao Ridge. At the end of the battle, the six of them, relying on their bravery and resourcefulness, annihilated 45 enemies and captured 38 guns. Among them, Comrade Ma Chunyu alone killed eight enemies.
  Defending Weifeng Mountain
    In September 1948, during the Jinzhou Campaign, our cavalry division blocked the enemy reinforcements from Guanli to Jinzhou on Weifeng Mountain, northeast of Linxi Pit on the Beining Road. On the third day, two divisions of enemy reinforcements attacked us. A fierce defensive battle began. At this time, Ma Chunyu was guarding a small bald mountain, no more than half a li long and no more than 200 meters high, with eight people. The enemy's earth-shattering artillery fire filled the mountains with thick smoke. Rain-like machine gun bullets flew whistling over their heads like a gale. The soldiers calmly fought back, and the enemy's two charges were repelled. The third time, the enemy used platoon volleys to bombard their positions. When the shells hit the east side, they crawled to the west side; when they hit the west side, they crawled to the east side. Two soldiers' ears were deafened; one soldier's mouth was twisted; Comrade Ma Chunyu's ears were also deafened. Even so, his heart was firm. He knew the importance of defending this small earthen mountain for eliminating the enemy in Jinzhou. Therefore, he was determined to hold the position no matter what! In this way, the enemy's two battalion charges were again repelled by them. When the enemy launched the fifth charge, each person had only two or three bullets left, and the positions of friendly neighbors were also occupied by the enemy. Comrade Ma Chunyu said, "We fight for the people, we live together, and we die together. Everyone load your last bullet, and when the enemy comes within five steps, when I say charge, everyone charge together!" The soldiers picked up some stones and prepared to meet the invading enemy. When they received orders from their superiors to withdraw from the battle, the eight of them had achieved the following results: one day of defense, killing more than 200 enemies.

　　骑兵英雄马春雨
    木林
    马春雨同志是东北军区某部二连副指导员，他是一个立特功二次、获战斗英雄奖章三枚、甲级奖状一张、九次物质奖励的出色的战斗英雄。他生在热河省赤峰县一个雇农的家庭，要了半年饭，十二岁时给地主放猪，从十三岁起给人打短工，二十七岁参加人民解放军，二十八岁参加中国共产党，今年三十二岁。
  抢山头战斗
    一九四七年十一月，蒋匪九十二军二十一师和九十四军四十三师，向朝阳一带进犯。我骑兵师的任务是：插到敌人后方，待敌溃逃时，予以截击。当时马春雨同志任副排长。战斗开始后的第二天早晨，我军占据的山头，被从义县城里出援的敌人攻占。团长命令二连坚决夺回山头。马春雨同志带着三个战士，冲在最前面，冒着敌人七、八挺机枪和两门六○炮的猛击，打死二十多个敌人，完成了夺回山头的任务。
    这时敌人已开始撤退，先头的敌人用一个营的兵力扑向我军阵地，企图打开退路。我某部某连阵地，又被敌攻占了。为了控制这条道路，歼灭逃敌，二连便与敌人展开了激烈的抢山头战斗。马春雨端着枪像猛虎一样，不管炮弹打得满身是土，不管子弹在身边嗖嗖直飞，也不管头上两架飞机的低空扫射，只是一个劲地猛冲。终于，马春雨同志最先抢占了山顶。这时敌人也冲到离山顶约二十米的地方。他站在山上朝着下面敌人就开起枪来，打死了五、六个敌人。他打退了敌人，全连便随着赶上，占领了山头，将敌人压缩在大凌河沙滩上。这时，我追击部队也从后面紧紧追来。敌首尾受敌，溃不成军，在我前后夹击下，淹死和被打死了五、六百人，其余全部放下了武器。
    这个战斗结束后，接着就是两昼夜的急行军，去截击从义县逃跑的敌一七四师。马春雨同志的排担任尖兵排。他们到达余家庄时与敌尖兵排相遇，双方即展开战斗。马春雨同志乘着一个敌机枪射手换梭子的时候，跃马冲入敌阵，向他一刀砍去；敌机枪射手一闪身，他便顺手将机枪夺到手中，在马上扫射起来，杀得敌人惊惶失措而缴了这一排敌人的枪，并阻住了敌人的去路。全团乘敌人在狭窄路上拥挤一团，兵力未能展开的时候，便向敌进行围击，仅一个钟头即歼灭了敌人的一个师。
  六个人的战绩
    一九四八年五月，盘据承德的蒋匪十三军准备逃跑。我骑兵某师在滦平、承德间的营坊将敌阻击。天刚亮时，一、二连与从滦平跑出的敌人开了火。冲击三道岭时，因为山岭太高，马不容易上去，马春雨同志便下了马，带着六个同志冲在最前面。他们打死二十多个敌人后，子弹没有了。马春雨动员大家说：“共产党的队伍，没有子弹就向敌人手里去夺！”在他鼓动下，六个人拿着手榴弹奋勇前冲。他们到了半山腰，就缴了敌人的四挺美式步枪。占领了三道岭后，又往四道岭、五道岭打去。战斗结束时，他们六个人凭着勇猛和机智，歼敌四十五名，缴枪三十八支。其中，马春雨同志一个人打死了八个敌人。
  坚守魏峰山
    一九四八年九月，锦州战役时，我骑兵师在北宁路林西坑东北魏峰山上，阻击由关里增援锦州的敌人。第三天，敌人援兵两个师向我进攻。激烈的坚守战开始了。这时，马春雨带着八个人守在长不过半里、高不过二百米的小秃山上。敌人震天的炮火，炸得山前山后浓烟弥漫。雨一般的机枪子弹，像刮风一样嗖嗖地从他们头上飞过。战士们沉着应战，敌人的两次冲锋，都被打退了。第三次，敌人用排炮向他们阵地轰击。炮弹打在东边，他们就爬在西边；打在西边，他们就爬在东边。两个战士的耳朵被炸聋了；一个战士的嘴被炸歪了；马春雨同志的耳朵也被炸得听不见声音。虽然如此，但他的心是坚定的。他深知坚守这个小土山，对消灭锦州敌人的作用。因此，他下定决心：无论如何，也要守住阵地！这样，敌人两个营的冲锋又被他们打退了。敌人发动第五次冲锋时，每个人只剩下两三颗子弹，友邻的阵地也被敌人占领了。马春雨同志说：“咱们为人民战斗，活就活在一起，死就死在一起。大家把顶门火顶上，敌人来到五步远时，我说冲，大家就一齐冲！”战士们检了一些石头，准备迎击来犯的敌人。在得到上级命令撤出战斗时，他们八个人的战绩是：一天的坚守，打死敌人二百多。（附图片）
