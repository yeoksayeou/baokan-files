　　Xinhua News Agency, Andong, September 26th: Our compatriots who were injured during the U.S. aircraft bombing of Andong on the night of the 22nd of this month are gradually recovering after days of treatment. Wang Shuxin, a worker at the Andong Xinhua Lumber Mill from Wendeng County, Shandong Province, 42 years old, was seriously injured. His left leg was pierced by shrapnel and he was immediately sent to Liaodong Provincial Hospital for compression to stop the bleeding and was injected with a sedative. According to the doctor's examination of the wound, the entry point of the shrapnel was 3.5 cm in diameter and the exit point was 3 cm in diameter. Fortunately, the blood vessels and leg bones were not injured, and he can be discharged from the hospital in two months. Yue Changjiang, a communications soldier from a local garrison unit who was grazed by shrapnel, is from Fuxin County, Liaoxi Province, and is 21 years old. His injury was relatively minor, and after the unit's medical personnel applied medicine and bandaged it, he has continued to work. Pei Aiyu, a resident's infant who was temporarily stunned, is only 40 days old and is the daughter of Pei Zhenzhe, a worker at the Andong Guanghua Cotton Weaving Factory. After the child fainted, her mother, Ms. Pei, immediately took her to the No. 2 Health Station of the Municipal Health Bureau for treatment. After the doctor performed artificial respiration, she recovered in a few minutes.
