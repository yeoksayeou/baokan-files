　　The People's Divine Gunner, Cui Yongfeng

　　Each of his miraculously accurate shells sent the enemy fleeing in disarray. In battle, Cui Yongfeng's artillery displayed unparalleled might, striking at the enemy.

　　"When encountering difficulties, find ways to overcome them!" This is a saying often spoken by the people's gunner, Cui Yongfeng. He is the company commander of the First Company of an artillery regiment in the Fourth Field Army.

　　In the spring of 1946, the Northeast Democratic Allied Army (i.e., the Fourth Field Army)'s 19th Brigade was tasked with blocking the Kuomintang bandit army's attack on Fushun. At that time, Cui Yongfeng was a soldier in the artillery company. Responding to the call from higher authorities, he found two 82mm mortars covered in red rust in the scrap heap of the Benxi Lake Iron Factory. After polishing them with gasoline, these two cannons, in Cui Yongfeng's hands, began to show their might, repelling the enemy with nineteen shells in the Liandaowan battle, and began to perform meritorious service for the people.

　　In the same year, during the battle to defend Siping, a company of the Kuomintang bandit's New First Army was surrounded in Liujiazi, and the mortar company was tasked with blocking a battalion of enemy reinforcements.

　　Cui Yongfeng was already a glorious Communist Party member at this time. He made up his mind and said, "I must fight even better to be worthy of the Party!" However, the entire company had only ten shells left, making it very difficult to complete the task. But Comrade Cui Yongfeng said, "When encountering difficulties, we must find ways to overcome them!" In order to ensure that every shell had an effect, he risked danger to go down the mountain to measure the intervals of several roads the enemy might take and the distances to various targets (because at that time, our army did not have ranging instruments). When he excitedly and confidently returned from the mountain, he said to his comrades, "This time, we are foolproof!"

　　Sure enough, a company of enemies appeared on the small road in the middle. Because the people's gunner, Comrade Cui Yongfeng, was confident, he waited calmly for the enemy to enter the distance he had measured. With a "boom," a shell hit the enemy's vanguard, scaring the enemy into turning around and running, but the second shell hit the enemy's rear. The enemies in the back ran forward, and the enemies in the front ran back, crowding together. The third shell hit right in the middle of the enemy's ranks, killing or wounding more than twenty.

　　The enemy's second charge was defeated by Cui Yongfeng in the same way as the first. The unyielding enemy organized a battalion for the third time, charging in three directions, no longer using the original routes. Cui Yongfeng laughed from above, saying, "No matter what, you can't escape the routes I measured!" He was happy at first, but then he saw that there were only four shells left. If four shells could not repel the enemy, the position would be very dangerous. So he thought, "Overcome the difficulties!" He accurately fired a shell head-on at the enemy that was approaching most closely, disrupting that route of the enemy. Then, he used another shell to disrupt the third route of the enemy. When the enemies frantically converged on the middle route, he fired the last two shells into the enemy crowd. The enemy retreated and did not come up again.

　　The next year, during the battle for Siping, the Red Building they were attacking was made of steel and concrete. The 82mm mortar shells would explode upon hitting the wall and have no effect. At this time, Comrade Cui Yongfeng thought of the Type 97 mortar because the shells had delayed-action fuses, exploding only after entering the building. But another difficulty arose: he had to stand on the roof to aim at the enemy, and the cannon could not be placed on the roof. In order to complete the task assigned by the Party, he braved the enemy's intense gunfire, climbed onto the roof, untied his leggings, tied a small brick to them, making a plumb line. He used the plumb line to aim at the enemy, and then aligned the mortar with this aiming line. After seven shells were fired, the troops charged up, and a battalion of enemies surrendered. After occupying the Red Building, only one cannon hole was seen on the roof of the Red Building. The miracle of seven shells fired from one cannon hole earned Comrade Cui Yongfeng the title of Divine Gunner.

　　Entering the Pass and going south, Cui Yongfeng's artillery displayed unparalleled might everywhere, striking at the enemy. When cooperating with the fraternal troops of the Second Field Army to advance into southern Yunnan, they climbed countless steep mountains. When horses were killed, they carried the cannons on their shoulders. After a difficult march of twenty-eight days, they arrived at Jianshui. In the battle of Lengshuigou, due to the needs of the offensive deployment, the Type 92 infantry gun carried by Comrade Cui Yongfeng had to be fired in a narrow alley. However, the cannon could not be set up in the alley. Comrade Cui Yongfeng braved the enemy's artillery fire and set up the cannon in a house. His target was a building, but a wall blocked the front of the building, the height of the wall and the height of the building differing by only twenty centimeters. It was very difficult to hit such a target with a cannon; if it was aimed too high, the shell would fly over; if it was aimed too low, it would hit the wall, and below the wall were our own troops waiting to charge. The people's gunner, Comrade Cui Yongfeng, could not help but become anxious, but the task awaited him. Finally, with his accurate shooting, he fired three shells in a row, all passing about ten centimeters to the left and right of the wall and hitting the target. When the troops charged up, the enemy surrendered their weapons.

　　In battle, Comrade Cui Yongfeng was always able to overcome difficulties and complete his tasks, and he repeatedly created miracles in battle, making him a people's hero with six great merits, earning him the title of combat hero and receiving the hero's medal. (Attached picture)

　　人民的神炮手崔永峰
    孙景瑞
    他每一发奇迹一样准确的炮弹，打得敌人狼狈奔逃；在战斗中，崔永峰的炮到处显出无比的威风，打击着敌人。
    “遇到艰难想办法克服！”这是人民炮手崔永峰常说的一句话。他是四野某军炮兵团一连的连长。
    一九四六年春，东北民主联军（即第四野战军）十九旅担任了阻击进攻抚顺的蒋匪军。那时，崔永峰在炮兵连里当战士，他响应上级的号召，在本溪湖铁工厂的废品堆里找出两门生满红锈的八二迫击炮，用汽油擦亮了，从此，这两门炮便在崔永峰的手里，初显威风在连道湾战斗，用十九发炮弹击退敌人，为人民开始立功。
    同年，在保卫四平战斗中，蒋匪新一军的一个连被包围在六家子，迫击炮连担任了阻击敌人一个营增援的任务。
    崔永峰这时已经是一个光荣的共产党员，他下了决心说：“我要打得更好，才对的起党！”可是，全连仅有十发炮弹了，完成任务是很艰难的，但崔永峰同志却说：“遇到了困难要想法克服！”他为了每一发炮弹都发生作用，便冒着危险到山下去测量敌人可能通过的几条道的间隔和各种目标的距离（因为那时我军中还没有测距仪器）。当他从山下兴奋而有信心的上山时，他向同志们说：“这回万无一失！”
    果然，敌人一个连从中间的小路上出现了。人民炮手崔永峰同志因为心中有底，便不慌不忙的等待着敌人进入他所量好的距离内。“轰”的一声，一发炮弹打中了敌人的前卫，吓的敌人回头就跑，可是，第二发炮弹又打中了敌人的后尾。后面的敌人往前跑，前面的敌人往后跑，挤成一团。第三发炮弹就正打在敌人队伍的中间，一共杀伤敌人二十多。
    敌人第二次冲锋，和第一次一样地被崔永峰打垮。不死心的敌人，第三次组织了一个营的兵力，分成三路冲来，原先走的路不走了。崔永峰在上面笑着说：“怎么着也没有跑出我测的路！”他先是高兴，可是又一看，炮弹只剩下了四发，四发炮弹打不退敌人，阵地就很危险，于是他想：“克服困难！”便准确地向走得最近的一路敌人迎头打了一炮，把那一路敌人打乱；紧接着，他又把第三路敌人也用一发炮弹打乱，敌人疯狂地向中间一路靠拢时，他把最后两发炮弹都打在敌人群里。敌人退了，再也没上来。
    第二年打四平，因为他们所攻击的红楼是钢骨水泥的，八二迫击炮弹打到墙上就炸，不发生作用。这时，崔永峰同志便想起了九七迫击炮，因为炮弹有延期信管，打进屋里才炸。但困难又来了，他除非站在屋顶上，才能向敌人瞄准，炮又不能上房。他为完成党给予的任务，冒着敌人密集的射击火力，爬上屋顶，解下了绑腿，拴上一块小砖头，使成垂直线，用绑腿向敌人瞄准，再把迫击炮身对准这条瞄准线。当七发炮弹打出去以后，部队便冲上去，一个营的敌人举手投降。当占领了红楼后，却在红楼屋顶上只看到了一个炮洞；七发炮弹从一个炮洞打进去的奇迹，使崔永峰同志获得了神炮手的称号。
    进关、南下，崔永峰的炮到处显出了无比的威风，打击着敌人。当配合二野兄弟部队进军滇南时，爬过无数陡峭的高山，马被摔死了，便用肩扛着炮前进。艰苦行军二十八天，到了建水。在冷水沟战斗中，由于进攻布置的需要。崔永峰同志所携带的九二步兵炮必须在一条狭窄的小巷内射击，可是小巷架不开炮，崔永峰同志便冒敌人炮火，把炮架在屋里。他的射击目标是一所楼房，但是在楼房前却挡着一堵墙，墙高和楼高只差二十生的，用炮打这样的目标，是很困难的，打高了，炮弹飞过去，打低了，打在墙上，墙下却又是自己的部队，等待冲锋。人民炮手崔永峰同志不禁焦急了，可是任务等待着他，终于，用他准确的射击，连打了三发炮弹，都从墙上十生的左右的地方过去击中了目标。当部队冲上去时，敌人缴了枪。
    崔永峰同志在战斗中，每次都能克服困难，完成任务，而且在战斗中屡创奇迹，使他成为六大功的人民功臣，获得了战斗英雄的称号，得到了英雄奖章。（附图片）
