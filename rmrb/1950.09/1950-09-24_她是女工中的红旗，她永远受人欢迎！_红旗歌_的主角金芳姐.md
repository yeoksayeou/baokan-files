　　She is the Red Flag Among Female Workers, She is Always Popular!
　　Sister Jin Fang, the Protagonist of the "Red Flag Song"
　　Xia Jingfan
　　The heroes praised in the "Red Flag Song" have solidified the new production order and new labor discipline. With the great spirit of the working class and active production actions, they have practiced the policy of labor-capital unity and production savings. Therefore, the capitalists are keen to operate and expand equipment, making the Shijiazhuang Daxing Textile Factory appear prosperous. This is a brilliant example of the development of production in private industry under the New Democratic economic system. Who is the standard figure in this brilliant example? That is Comrade Yan Jinfen, the protagonist of the "Red Flag Song," the banner of female workers, a good government committee member, and a good daughter of the Party.
　　Loyal and simple Yan Jinfen has never thought that she is a People's Representative of Shijiazhuang City, a member of the Municipal Government Committee, a member of the Provincial Women's Federation, a member of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Women's Federation, and the secretary of the Party branch and thus has any pride and complacency; on the contrary, these make her more modest. Every day in the spinning room, she helps the workers tirelessly with her hands and mouth, watching the machines, doffing bobbins (she is the deputy leader of the spinning group), and solving work problems. The sisters in the workshop cannot do without her. Wherever she goes, there is laughter; wherever she is transferred away from, there are pouting lips. Whenever she is not on shift, the workers are anxious to ask, "Where did Sister Jinfen go?" Once they heard she was sick, the female workers asked for leave to see her before the end of the shift. When she goes out for a few days of meetings, the workers say, "Without Sister Jinfen, the factory seems to be missing something—" If there are any small disagreements between the sisters, they also say, "Let's wait until Sister Jinfen comes back!" Indeed, when Jinfen is on shift, she helps whoever is too busy; if anyone is a little sick, she immediately does the work for them, or takes them to see a doctor; she cares about the female workers' health and personal issues at any time and place, and sometimes even runs to the sisters' homes to help them solve difficulties. Therefore, workers tell her any problems or opinions. She has become a good example in the factory for solving difficulties and publicizing policies. The female workers praise her, saying, "Jinfen is the red flag among the female workers, she is always popular!" The unity shown in Jinfen is precisely the "united production" resolved by the Shijiazhuang People's Representative Conference.
　　The manager of the private Daxing Yarn Factory said: "This is a situation I have never seen since I started the factory."
　　After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the Daxing Textile Factory resumed production with the help of the People's Government and was managed on behalf of the owners for two years. Last November, it was returned to private ownership, and some degree of discord began to appear in labor-capital interests. In the early days of the return, the factory was very worried, management was lax, and they couldn't let go of the old ways and a set of old management methods; from state-owned to private, the workers' thinking also fluctuated, and some workers said: "In the past, capitalists didn't treat us like human beings, and now we are working for him again?!" They didn't like the pompous manager, and when the manager entered the factory, many female workers focused their eyes on him, breathing through their noses. Some even had the idea of "watch fewer machines, rest more, increase benefits, and save after the contract is signed." Obviously, these are all incorrect. Under this sharp contradiction, the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League of the Daxing Yarn Factory conducted policy education on "developing production and benefiting both labor and capital" for the workers. Although Jinfen didn't think it through for a few days at first, she quickly accepted the tasks of the Party and the trade union, vigorously publicized and explained to the workers, and patiently persuaded and educated anyone who made complaints or said strange things, often staying late after work without resting. When she explained the labor-capital benefit policy to the workers based on her own understanding, she said: "Labor-capital benefit is actually triple benefit. If production is good, both labor and capital benefit, and the country also benefits." She set an example by working tirelessly in the workshop and being more considerate of the workers' lives; therefore, when the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League led all the workers to implement the policy of united production and launched production competitions, Jinfen was a powerful promoter. On the other hand, in the factory management committee (she is one of the members), she advocated democratic management and relied on the workers. In the first competition (March) after the return to private ownership, the capitalist Manager Lu entered the factory for the first time to approach the workers and check the work. Jinfen led him to meet all the model female workers and introduced their model deeds. From then on, Manager Lu often gratefully said to others in his personal experience: "Yan Jinfen has a very high prestige among the masses. After her introduction, the workers really regard me as the manager." He also said proudly: "I also used my brains to approach the workers, and the workers kindly call me manager when they see me. This is really a situation I have never seen since I started the factory."
　　Although Sister Jinfen is only twenty-two years old this year, she has been working at the Daxing Yarn Factory for nearly ten years. Three years ago, as soon as Shijiazhuang was liberated, he excitedly and bravely braved the enemy's bombing and returned to work in the factory. At that time, the factory had been bombed to ruins, and he helped the factory sew door curtains and sort out all the parts without fear of danger and hardship. When the machines were installed, there was a lack of steel rings. At this time, she mobilized the sisters to take out the steel rings they had saved in the past, and took several sisters to the rubble of the bombed "materials station" to look for them, and as a result, they picked out more than twenty boxes of usable steel rings, which allowed the spinning car to continue.
　　Speaking of work, Sister Jinfen is even more respected. Since liberation, she has always been an active leader among the workers. Everyone knows that she is a first-class expert in doffing and piecing yarn. She is always sent to manage the car that is difficult to manage, such as car No. 23, which everyone is unwilling to manage, but she automatically went there, and as a result, she made this car run very smoothly. At the same time, the car she watches is always clean, she immediately pieces the broken ends, never runs the car, doesn't slack off, works diligently, and can help others. Especially after becoming a government committee member and deputy spinning group leader, she still works honestly in the workshop as always. In this way, she invisibly encouraged everyone's production enthusiasm and increased her prestige among the masses. Older workers often say: "We want to learn from our Committee Member Yan." Younger workers say more kindly: "We want to learn from Sister Jinfen."
　　The Party's organizational discipline has gradually solidified with her life and actions. She is one of the people who arrive on time at the government committee. In the Party work, since she has been the secretary of the branch for more than a year, this branch has always been the best one in the factory. In May of this year, she was sick for some time, but she never forgot about the work of the branch. When her sister Xiaoduo (who is the organization member of the same branch as her) went home after work, she often asked about the work of the branch and the ideological situation of Party members and non-Party members. After she recovered from her illness, the first thing she did when she entered the factory was to convene a branch meeting to study the work of the branch.
　　In terms of life, she is more bitter than other female workers. The factory is more than two miles away from home, and there is a mother in her sixties at home who cannot get out of bed due to illness. The two sisters go to work and no one sends food, so they can only eat some dry food; when they get off work, they have to cook for the patient first, and then cook for themselves. She has many meetings to attend, often going to the meeting place after work, which makes it difficult for her to take care of everything. However, she has never told anyone how busy she is and how hard her life is, nor has she been detached from the masses, giving full play to her working-class character and noble qualities.
　　Yan Jinfen pays close attention to her own learning. When she was liberated, she didn't know a single word. In the past two years, she has been able to barely read newspapers and general documents.
　　The red flag is advancing, Jinfen is advancing, and this glorious banner will always shine on the faces of the workers. (Attached picture)

　　她是女工中的红旗，她永远受人欢迎！
    “红旗歌”的主角金芳姐
    夏景凡
    “红旗歌”里赞诵的英雄们，已经把新的生产秩序与新的劳动纪律凝结起来了。他们以工人阶级伟大的胸怀和积极生产的行动，实践了劳资团结、生产节约的方针。因而资方锐意经营，扩充设备，使石家庄大兴纺织厂呈现出一副欣欣向荣的景象。这是新民主主义经济制度中私营工业发展生产的光辉范例。谁是这个光辉范例中的标准人物呢？那就是“红旗歌”里的主角、女工的旗帜、政府的好委员、党的好闺女阎金芬同志。
    忠诚朴实的阎金芬，她从没有以为自己是石家庄市的人民代表、市政府委员、省妇联会委员、市总工会与市妇联会委员以及党的支部书记而有丝毫骄傲与自满；这些，反而使她更虚心，每天在细纱间里更是手不停嘴不闲的帮助工人们看车、落纱（她是细纱副组长）、解决工作上的问题。车间里的姊妹们离不开她。她到哪车上，哪车上哈哈笑；把她打哪车上调走，哪车上就噘起嘴。她一不在班上，工人就急着问：“金芬姐那儿去了？”一次听说她病了，女工们不等到下班，就要求请假去看她。她出去开几天会，工人们就说：“金芬姐不在，厂里就像少了点啥一样——”，姊妹间闹点小意见，也说：“咱等金芬姐回来了再说！”真的，金芬在班上，看谁忙不过来，就去帮助；谁有一点病，就马上替谁做活，或领着去看病；对于女工的身体与切身问题，她随时随地的关心着，有时还跑到姊妹们家去帮助他们解决困难，因此，工人间有什么问题或意见，都对她说。她成了工厂里解决困难和宣传政策的好榜样，女工们称颂她说：“金芬，就是女工中的红旗，她永远受人欢迎！”在金芬身上表现出来的团结，正是石家庄市人民代表会议所决议的“团结生产”。
  私营大兴纱厂经理说：“这是我办工厂以来没有见过的情形。”
    石家庄解放后，大兴纺织厂经人民政府恢复生产，代管两年，去年十一月发还私营，开始出现劳资利益某种程度上的不协调。发还初期，厂方顾虑很大，经营松懈，放不下过去的架子和一套旧的管理方法；由国营转为私营，工人思想上也有些波动，有的工人说：“过去资本家没有把咱当成人，现在又来给他干活了？！”看见大模大样的经理就不顺眼，经理一进厂，许多女工把眼睛集中在他身上，用鼻子出着气。甚至有人存着“少看车、多休息，提高待遇，订了合同再节约”的想法。显然这都是不正确的。在这尖锐的矛盾下，大兴纱厂的党、工、团对工人进行“发展生产、劳资两利”的政策教育，金芬虽然最初也有几天没大想开，但很快的接受了党和工会的任务，大力向工人们宣传解释，看见或听见谁闹情绪说怪话，就去耐心的说服教育，常常弄得下班后很久还不去休息。她根据自己的认识向工人们解释劳资两利政策时说：“劳资两利，实际是三利，把生产闹好了，劳资两利，对国家也有利。”她以身作则的不停的在车间里忙着，对工人的生活更加体贴；所以，党、工、团领导着全体工人贯彻团结生产方针，发动生产竞赛时，金芬是个有力的推动者。另一方面，她在工厂管理委员会（她是委员之一）上，倡导着民主管理，依靠工人。在发还私营后的第一次竞赛（三月）中，资方鲁经理第一次进厂接近工人检查工作，由金芬领着与全体模范女工见面，并介绍了她们的模范事迹。从这以后，鲁经理在亲身体验中常感激的对别人说：“阎金芬在群众里有很高的威信，我这经理经过她的介绍，工人才真正把我当成经理了。”并得意的说：“我也开动了脑筋，去接近工人，工人见我就亲切的叫经理，这真是我办工厂以来没有见过的情形。”
    金芬姐今年虽然才二十二岁，在大兴纱厂已经有了近十年的工龄。三年前，石家庄刚一解放，他就兴奋而勇敢的冒着敌人飞机的轰炸，到厂里复工。当时厂里已经炸的破烂不堪，他不避危险不辞劳苦的帮厂里缝门帘和整理一切零件。机器按好了，缺乏钢丝圈，这时她就动员姊妹们把过去个人存的钢丝圈拿出来，并且带着几个姊妹到被炸毁的“物料站”的砖瓦堆里去寻找，结果拣出了二十多盒能用的钢丝圈，才使细纱车继续开下去。
    说起工作，金芬姐更是受人尊敬，她从解放后，一直是工人中积极的带头人。谁都知道她是落纱接头数一数二的能手。那部车子难管，总是派她去，如二十三号车大家都不愿去管，但她却自动的去了，结果把这部车子使的很顺当。同时，她看的车子总是干干净净的，看见断头马上接，从不跑车，不偷懒，工作踏实，又能帮助别人，尤其当了政府委员及细纱副组长后，仍是始终如一的在车间里老老实实地工作着。这样，无形中就鼓励了大家生产情绪，也增长了她在群众中的威信。年纪大的工人常说：“我们要向我们的阎委员学习。”年纪小的工人更亲切的说：“我们要向金芬姐学习。”
    党的组织纪律性，已经和她的生活与行动逐步凝结起来了。在政府委员会上，她是准时到的一个。党的工作，从她担任支部书记一年多来，这个支部总是厂里最好的一个。今年五月，她病了一些时间，但对支部工作却没有一刻忘记，等她妹妹小朵（是同她一个支部的组织委员）下班回去，经常询问着支部工作和党员、非党员的思想情况，她病好后，进厂的第一件事便是召开支部大会，研究支部工作。
    在生活方面，她比其他女工都要苦些，工厂离家二里多路，家里有个六十多岁因病不能起床的母亲，姐妹两个上了班没人送饭，只能吃点干粮；下班回家，首先得给病人做饭，然后做自己的。她要参加的会很多，常是下了班进会场，使她顾不过来。但是，她从来没对别人表示过自己是如何的忙与生活的艰苦，也没有脱离群众的现象，充分发挥了她那工人阶级的本色与高贵品质。
    阎金芬，对于自己的学习抓的很紧。解放时她不认识一个字，两年多来，报纸和一般文件都能勉强看下来了。
    红旗在前进，金芬在前进，这面光荣的旗帜将永远照耀在工人的脸上。（附图片）
