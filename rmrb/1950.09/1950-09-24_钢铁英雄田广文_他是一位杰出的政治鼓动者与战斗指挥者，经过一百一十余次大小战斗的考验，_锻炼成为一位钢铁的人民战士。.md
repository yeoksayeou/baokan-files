Steel Hero Tian Guangwen
	He is an outstanding political mobilizer and combat commander who, after more than 110 major and minor battles, has become a steel-willed people's warrior.
	Comrade Tian Guangwen was originally a political instructor of a company in a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army. He was the political mobilizer and commander of the Baituhu (White Tiger) Village battle in the famous Jinbei infiltration campaign. He was awarded the Mao Zedong Medal by the Fourth Field Army, and the company led by Tian Guangwen was awarded the honorary title of "White Tiger Company".
	In the autumn offensive of 1948, the final liberation of the Northeast, in order to first capture Jinzhou City, it was necessary to clear the outer strongholds. Our army was ordered to penetrate Jinbei to cut off the connection between the Jinbei enemy and Jinzhou, in order to completely annihilate the Jinbei outer enemy forces. The company led by Tian Guangwen was the "penetration warfare" sharp knife team, and went straight into the enemy's heart - Baituhu Village, four miles away from Jinzhou City. The company was brave and tenacious, fighting the enemy all day long, resisting the enemy's offensive of more than a regiment under the cover of airplanes, artillery and five tanks, repelling the enemy's fifteen charges, and finally sticking to one courtyard and one house. Under the strong political mobilization of Tian Guangwen, all personnel displayed a high degree of fighting spirit for the people, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, and finally repelling the enemy, holding the position, blocking the enemy reinforcements from Jinbei, and effectively ensuring that the friendly neighboring troops completely annihilated the enemy's Provisional 22nd Division in Xuejiatun and Ertun in Jinbei, and finally victoriously captured Jinzhou City.
	At the beginning of the battle, the enemy infantry detoured from the east. Tian Guangwen commanded the troops to wait until the enemy reached about 20 meters away, and a burst of grenades drove the enemy back. Then, five tanks came one after another to attack our army, and six airplanes took turns strafing to cover the enemy's charge into the village. The smoke of gunpowder filled the air. In the artillery fire, the soldiers heard Instructor Tian shouting: "Hit the ones with big brimmed hats (enemy officers), hit the machine gun shooters..." Everyone calmly and bravely shot at the enemy. At noon, the battle became more intense. They retreated to a courtyard. Tian Guangwen said to the company commander: "We are both Party cadres, and we have to put in some effort today!" Then he said to everyone: "Comrades, the situation today is very serious. Although we are not born of the same mother, we are class brothers. Although the enemy is crazy, as long as we concentrate our strength, it doesn't matter." Everyone replied loudly: "Okay, company commander, instructor, don't worry, we will resolutely fight to the end and never give in!" Tian Guangwen's powerful mobilization produced tremendous power among the soldiers.
	Artillery fire fell in the courtyard. Tian Guangwen took advantage of the time when the enemy collapsed, pointed to the enemy's dead bodies and the fleeing enemies, and said: "As long as we are strong, we can defeat the enemy." Then he turned around and said to everyone: "Didn't we submit our volunteer application to the regimental Party committee? We must consolidate our training achievements in actual combat and strive to be a sharp knife company."
	At this time, Comrade Du Guangsheng sacrificed himself on the west wall. Tian painfully covered the martyr's body and said to everyone: "Comrades, we must avenge him!..." and told the Party group leader Wei Baotian: "Organize the Party members to build fortifications to avoid unnecessary losses, and only by holding the position can we be worthy of the Party and the people's cultivation." The enemy's several charges were repelled. Ammunition was running low, and Tian Guangwen proposed the slogan "Every bullet must hit its mark." When the sun was setting in the west, the enemy set fire to the house. At this time, the battle became more difficult. Tian shouted in the smoke: "Communist Party members and revolutionary soldiers! We must withstand the test at this time, open our eyes and monitor the enemy!" At this time, the enemy had already rushed to the base of the wall. Tian Guangwen and five comrades stood up together, and rifle grenades fired together. Tian Guangwen used up his grenades and picked up stones to smash at the enemy, and the enemy ran back again.
	It was dark, and there were even fewer bullets left. There were only 37 people including Company Commander Chen and Instructor Tian and a light machine gun. If they were dispersed, it would be difficult to defend the courtyard, so they retreated to a room. The enemy concentrated fire and frantically shot at the room, and approached the surrounding area of the courtyard. Even the enemy's voices could be heard. Looking at the few bullets left, he felt the situation was very critical. He thought: "I am a Communist Party member, and if I don't persist in the position and eliminate the enemy, it will hinder the entire mission." So he called the company commander: "Old Chen, although we haven't worked together for long, we are both Party cadres, and we will never give in to the enemy until death..." Company Commander Chen said calmly and firmly: "We will never give in until death and we will coexist with the position!" At six o'clock in the afternoon, the enemy's grenades were thrown to the base of the window. Tian Guangwen thought to himself: The moment of life and death has come! So he first burned the documents and application to join the Party in his bag. Everyone also burned the documents. Tian Guangwen then said to everyone: "The situation has reached this point today. I am a Communist Party member and I am ready to fight the enemy to the end!" Everyone said: "Instructor, we must never bow our heads in front of the enemy!" The artillery squad fired the last two shells, destroyed the artillery, and the bugler threw the bugle into the fire. Then everyone burned their gloves, belts, food money, and ration coupons. For five or six minutes, everyone was silent, and Party members and non-Party members were closely united around the company commander and instructor, forming a steel will to fight the enemy to the end to complete the task. Later, Tian Guangwen organized everyone to conduct political shouting at the enemy and sing songs. It was dark, and the gunfire was not intense. The sound of heavy machine guns came from a distance. Everyone shouted happily: "Reinforcements have arrived!" At this time, the enemy had quietly retreated. After three reconnaissance missions, there was no movement, and they immediately organized a breakout. Tian Guangwen said: "If we encounter the enemy when we go out, we must fight to the death. At the same time, there are still many wounded. We are class brothers and we must take them away." After preparing, the company commander was in front and Instructor Tian was in the back, and everyone carried the wounded in the middle. They walked for more than a mile in the dark before successfully meeting up with the main battalion.
	Comrade Tian Guangwen, under the cultivation of the Communist Party, has undergone the test of more than 110 major and minor battles, and has demonstrated the heroic qualities of the people's army. In the great furnace of revolutionary war, he is a veritable steel-willed people's warrior. (Picture attached)

　　钢铁英雄田广文
    他是一位杰出的政治鼓动者与战斗指挥者，经过一百一十余次大小战斗的考验，锻炼成为一位钢铁的人民战士。
    田广文同志原为人民解放军第四野战军某部一连政治指导员，是著名的锦北渗透战中白老虎屯战斗的政治鼓动者与指挥者，荣获第四野战军颁发的毛泽东奖章，田广文所领导的一连荣获“白老虎连”的光荣称号。
    在一九四八年最后解放东北的秋季攻势中，为了首先攻夺锦州城，必须扫清外围据点，我军奉命插入锦北切断锦北敌人与锦州的联系，以便全部歼灭锦北外围敌军。田广文领导的一连即为此“渗透战”的尖刀队，一直插进敌心脏——距锦州城四里的白老虎屯。该连英勇顽强，与敌作战终日，抗击敌人一个团以上兵力在飞机大炮及五辆坦克掩护下的进攻，击退敌人十五次冲锋，最后坚守一院一屋，全体人员在田广文有力的政治鼓动下，发挥了高度为人民而战的战斗精神，予敌重大杀伤，最后将敌击退，守住阵地，阻击锦北增援敌兵，有力的保证了友邻部队全部歼灭锦北薛家屯二屯敌暂编二十二师，最后胜利攻取锦州城。
    战斗开始，敌步兵由东迂回上来，田广文指挥部队等敌人到达约二十米时，一阵手榴弹将敌击回，接着敌人前后来了五辆坦克向我军攻击，六架飞机轮番扫射掩护着敌人向屯内冲锋，炮火硝烟弥漫。战士们在炮火中听到田指导员喊：“打大沿帽子的（敌军官），打机枪射手……”。大家沉着勇敢的向敌群射击。到正午，战斗更加激烈。他们撤到一座院子里，田广文对连长说：“咱俩都是党的干部，今天要出把力啦！”随即又向大家说：“同志们，今天的情况很严重，我们虽不是一母所生，但我们是阶级弟兄，敌人虽然疯狂，只要我们力量集中，没关系。”大家响亮回答：“好，连长、指导员，你放心，坚决干到底，决不屈服！”田广文有力的鼓动在战士中产生了巨大的力量。
    炮火落在院子里，田广文趁着敌垮下去的时间，指着敌人的死尸和狼狈溃逃的敌人说：“只要我们坚强，就能打垮敌人。”又回身向大家说：“我们不是向团党委提出了志愿书吗？我们要在实战中，巩固我们练兵中的成绩，争取做尖刀连。”
    这时西墙上杜广生同志牺牲了，田沉痛地将烈士尸体掩盖，向大家说：“同志们，我们要替他报仇！……”并告诉党小组长魏保田：“组织党员好作工事，避免不必要的损失，坚守住阵地，才对得起党和人民的培养。”敌人数次冲锋都被击退，弹药少了，田广文提出“弹不虚发”的号召。太阳平西时，敌人向屋内点起了大火。这时战斗越加艰苦，田在烟火里喊：“共产党员和革命战士们！要在这时候经得起考验，睁开眼，监视敌人呀！”这时敌人已冲到墙根下。田广文与五位同志一齐立起来，步枪手榴弹一齐开火。田广文将手榴弹用尽，搬起石头向敌人砸，敌人又向后跑去。
    天黑了，子弹更少了，只剩下陈连长、田指导员以下三十七人和一挺轻机枪，如果分散难以守住院子，于是就撤到一间屋子里。敌人集中火力向屋子里疯狂射击，并逼近院子周围，甚至可以听到敌人的说话声。他看着只剩下的几粒子弹，感到情况非常危急，他想：“我是共产党员，不坚持阵地消灭敌人，与整个任务是有妨碍的。”于是招呼连长：“老陈，你我虽在一起工作不久，但同是党的干部，我们至死也不在敌人面前屈服……”。陈连长沉着坚毅的说：“死也不屈服，与阵地共存亡！”下午六点钟，敌人的手榴弹扔到窗根下了。田广文心里想：生死关头的时候到了！于是先把自己图囊中的文件及入党志愿书等烧掉，大家也把文件都烧了，田广文随即向大家说：“今天情况已到这个地步，我是个共产党员，准备和敌人拚到底！”大家说：“指导员，我们决不能在敌人面前低头！”炮班把最后两发炮弹打完了，折毁了炮，司号员将号扔在火堆里，随后大家把手套、皮带、菜金、粮票都烧了，这样五六分钟大家沉默不语，党员和非党员紧密团结在连长和指导员的周围，结成钢铁的意志，为完成任务和敌人拚到底。后来田广文就组织大家对敌进行政治喊话，并唱起歌来。天黑了，枪炮也不激烈了，远处传来重机枪声。大家高兴地喊着：“增援到了！”这时敌人已悄悄撤退，经过三次侦察，没有动静，马上组织突围，田广文说：“出去若遇见敌人可要死拚，同时还有许多伤号，我们是阶级弟兄，一定要把他们带走。”准备好了，连长在前田指导员在后，大家背着伤号在中间，摸着黑走了一里多路，才与主力营胜利会师了。
    田广文同志在共产党的培养下，经过一百十余次的大小战斗考验，表现了人民军队的英雄本色。在革命战争的大熔炉中，他是一位名符其实的钢铁的人民战士。（附图片）
