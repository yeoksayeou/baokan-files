　　Beijing Native Produce Exchange Conference Reaches Consensus:
    Public and Private Sectors Closely Integrated for Marketing and Sales
    Private Native Produce Industry Must Concentrate Capital, Change Business Methods, and Break Conservative Thinking
    [This newspaper’s dispatch] This newspaper correspondent Xiao Disheng reports: The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce convened a Native Produce Exchange Conference last month. Participants included representatives from ten private industries – dried and fresh fruits, paints (partially raw lacquer), paper and stationery, Chinese medicine, mountain products, vegetables, tobacco leaves, seafood, ceramics, and bricks and tiles – as well as representatives from the state-owned Beijing Native Produce Branch Company. The characteristic of Beijing's native produce business in the past, like the characteristics of market consumption, was that most were engaged in retail, and few were engaged in large-scale exchange of native produce materials from distant places. Coupled with the unstable prices during the decade of war, as well as the weaknesses of the native produce industry, such as weak and dispersed capital and poor reputation, the exchange relationship between Beijing and other regions has never recovered since liberation. Beijing's products cannot find their due sales channels, and the goods needed by Beijing cannot be purchased in a timely manner, but can only be bought sporadically in Tianjin and other markets. These goods, after several transfers, increased the cost, making them difficult to sell, resulting in a sluggish business in Beijing's native produce industry. However, since April and May this year, the state-owned native produce company has overcome some difficulties and achieved considerable results in operating native produce and supporting and driving private industry and commerce. For example, Longkou vermicelli produced in Beijing was difficult to export due to the blockade and disruption of various ports by imperialism since liberation, and there were no sales channels. The Beijing vermicelli industry did not operate well and many stopped work. After the Beijing Native Produce Company contacted the Guangzhou Native Produce Company, it exported vermicelli through Guangzhou. In just May, June, and July, the native produce company sold more than 300,000 catties of vermicelli through Guangzhou. Another example is the cool mats produced in Zhejiang, fresh ginger produced in Shandong, and bananas produced in Guangdong. They could not find sales channels locally and were backlogged in the hands of farmers and native produce companies. Some even deteriorated and were lost due to long-term storage. However, the northern market was very in need of them. Private merchants in the two places did not understand the production and sales situation of each other and lacked capital, so the exchange of native produce was always not smooth. The Beijing Native Produce Company contacted private merchants, understood the market needs, and transferred 40,000 cool mats from Hangzhou and nearly 80,000 catties of fresh ginger from Shandong, distributing them to private merchants for consignment sales, opening up sales channels. Now the Native Produce Company is also establishing contracts with the private joint venture of dried and fresh fruits, preparing to use the organizational strength of the state-owned enterprise and the capital and technology of private merchants to purchase bananas from Guangdong on behalf of the company, so that the large amount of special products backlog in the south can find a way out. At this native produce exchange conference, the opinions of various relevant industries were that the Native Produce Company had helped and driven the private merchants' operation, playing a considerable role in how to develop native produce exchange and communication between production and sales. Therefore, the Dried and Fresh Fruit Industry Association, Chinese medicine, paper and stationery industries have further proposed that they hope the state-owned Native Produce Company can provide assistance.
    According to the current situation, there are still some obstacles that need to be removed in order to develop native produce exchange: First, some private merchants still have a waiting and watching attitude and conservative thinking, insufficient understanding of objective favorable conditions, and lack of confidence in overcoming difficulties. Second, some of the business directions cannot keep up with the needs of changing situations. For example, in the past, Beijing agencies and schools used brush pens a lot, and southern paper sold a lot. According to the industry's estimates, before the July 7th Incident, the annual sales were more than 1.9 million knives, but now whether it is printing, agencies or schools, they mostly use fountain pens and pencils, so it is difficult for southern paper sales to restore its old appearance. Some were accustomed to sitting in the city to do retail and wait for opportunities in the situation of rising prices in the past, and rarely studied how to handle long-distance transportation and other laborious transactions. These are obstacles in the exchange of native produce materials. The conference unanimously agreed that only by being honest and expending some effort, in order to meet the current and future needs, changing the old business methods, facing the countryside, directly bringing the vast rural native products to the city, and promoting urban-rural exchange, is the way out. Furthermore, in order to overcome the weaknesses of scattered strength and weak capital, everyone believed that it is necessary to concentrate funds and manpower and try the method of joint operation to carry out larger-scale long-distance material exchange, but it is necessary to prevent dependence and manipulation. In terms of public-private relations, the state-owned company should take the initiative to organize and drive private merchants under the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, and correctly and reasonably grasp the price policy under the circumstances of taking care of the interests of production, transportation, and sales. There should be appropriate regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences. At the same time, in order to develop business in a long-term and broad manner, and to guarantee the interests of both parties, contracts must be signed between the public and private sectors or between the private sectors. When private capital is insufficient, the government may provide loans depending on the specific circumstances.
    In order to maintain close contact in the future, it was also proposed at the meeting that a native produce exchange consultation group with the participation of both public and private parties be established after the meeting to jointly discuss prices, mutual integration, and other issues. In the past, due to insufficient contact, the price difference of some goods was sometimes unreasonable, which affected the operation of private merchants. This is what the state-owned Native Produce Company should often study and grasp in the future. At the same time, it was also proposed at the meeting that both the public and private sectors must pay attention to quality and maintain credibility. In the past, some merchants mixed fakes and impurities, resulting in loss of credibility and affecting business. This situation urgently needs to be overcome in the future.
    Through this conference, the public and private sectors have reached a new unified understanding on the ideas, methods and ways of developing native produce exchange.

　　京土产交流会议取得一致认识
    公私紧密结合进行运销
    私人土产业须集中资力改变经营方法打破保守思想
    【本报讯】本报通讯员萧涤生报道：京市商业局在上月曾召开土产交流会议，参加的有私营干鲜果、颜料（生漆部分）、纸张文教用品、国药、山货、菜业、烟叶、海味、磁业、砖瓦灰等十个行业及国营北京土产分公司代表，研讨目前京市各该业所存在的问题与解决的办法。过去京市土产经营的特点，和市场消费的特点一样，大多是办理零售的多，办理远地大宗土产物资交流的少。加上十几年战争情况下，物价不稳定，以及土产行业资力薄弱分散，信誉不著等等弱点，致解放以来，京市与各地交流关系，始终没有恢复。京市的产品不能找到应有的销路，京市需要的货物，也不能及时买到，只能零星去到天津等市场现买。这些货物，经过几次转手，加大了成本，不易销售，形成京市土产行业的生意萧条。但从今年四、五月份以来，国营土产公司在经营土产，扶持带动私营工商业中，已克服了部分困难，并取得了相当成绩。如北京产的龙口粉丝，由于解放以来各港口在帝国主义封锁扰乱下，出口困难，没有销路，京市粉丝业即营业不好，并很多停工歇业。北京土产公司和广州土产公司取得联系后，取道广州外销，只五、六、七三个月，土产公司经广州市销出粉丝即达三十余万斤。又如浙江产的凉席，山东产的鲜姜，广东产的香蕉，在当地找不到销路，积压在农民和土产公司手中，并有的因长期积存变质损失，可是北方市场上很需要，两地私商产销情况互不了解，资力不足，因之土产交流始终不畅。京市土产公司联系了私商，了解了市场需要，从杭州调运了四万余片凉席，从山东调拨了近八万斤的鲜姜，分配给私商代销，打开了销路。现在土产公司又正在和私营组成的干鲜果联营商建立合同，准备以国营的组织力量，和私商的资力与技术，向广东代购香蕉，可使南方积压的大宗特产找到出路。这次土产交流会议上，各有关行业的意见，对如何开展土产交流，沟通产销关系，都认为土产公司是帮助并带动了私商经营，起了相当大的作用。因此，干鲜果业公会，国药、纸张文教用品等业都进一步提出，希望国营土产公司能够予以帮助。
    根据目前情形，开展土产交流还是有一些障碍须要解除：首先是思想上还有一部分私商存在等待观望以及守旧思想，对客观有利条件认识不足，对克服困难缺乏信心。其次在经营方向上也有的跟不上形势变化的需要，比如过去北京机关学校多用毛笔，南纸销路很大。据该业估计，七七事变前，年销一百九十余万刀，而现在无论印刷，机关学校多用钢笔、铅笔，因此南纸销路很难恢复旧观。还有的过去在物价不断上涨情形下，习惯了坐在城里办零售、等机会，很少去研究办理长途运输等费力的买卖。这些都是开展土产物资交流中的障碍。会议一致认为，只有老老实实，费一把力量，为适合目前及将来需要，改变旧的经营方法，面向农村，直接把广大农村土产带到城市，促进城乡交流，才是出路。再就是为了克服力量分散、资金薄弱的弱点，大家认为当集中资金人力，试行联营的办法，以进行较大宗长途的物资交流，但必须防止依赖思想与操纵的偏向。在公私关系上，国营公司应在公私兼顾的原则下主动组织带动私商，并在照顾产、运、销三方面利益的情形下，正确合理的掌握物价政策，要有适当的地区差价，批发与零售差价。同时为了长久的广泛的开展业务，和保证双方利益，无论公与私或私与私之间都必须订立合同。私人资力不足时，政府视具体情况并可予以贷款。
    为了今后密切联系，会上并提出会后成立公私双方参加的土产交流协商小组，共同协商价格，互相结合等问题。过去因联系不够，有的货物，有时差价不合理，影响了私商的经营，这是今后国营土产公司应经常研究掌握的。同时会上又提出，无论公私都必须注意质量，保持信誉，过去有的商人掺假掺杂，以致失掉信誉影响营业的情况，今后急须克服。
    经过这次会议，公私双方在开展土产交流的思想上、方式方法上都得到了一个新的统一的认识。
