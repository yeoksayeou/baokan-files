*Truth Daily* Correspondent Reports from Pyongyang

[Xinhua News Agency, 31st] TASS Moscow, 28th: *Truth Daily*'s Pyongyang correspondent, Kornylov, reported on the atrocities of the invading U.S. Navy in Korea, stating: The actions of the American pirates blockading the Korean coast have recently intensified. They regularly bombard the coast, subjecting the narrow road leading to the Diamond Mountain sanatoriums and resorts to fire. They bombard fishing villages, slaughtering all living things within their range.

The small village of Buin-ri (transliteration) on the Korean east coast in the 38th parallel area has been completely wiped off the map by American warships. The fishing village that had settled on the Japanese coast not long ago no longer exists. The place where they lived is now a huge cracked gap and cave caused by violent bombardment.

Korean soldiers and sailors defending the maritime border have dealt heavy blows to the invaders. Their battle record includes sinking several American warships, including a cruiser. Many American aircraft protecting the warships were destroyed by the accurate fire of coastal anti-aircraft gunners.

After returning to the airport after sinking an enemy destroyer in the Incheon area, the people's pilots said to their comrades who congratulated them: If we fail to sink the destroyer with our bombs, we will, like the Soviet hero Gastello, rather crash it with our own plane than allow American robbers to kill our children and mothers, our close and beloved ones. These words express the Korean people's selfless feelings of defending their motherland in resistance to American interventionists.

　　封锁朝鲜海岸、专门轰击渔村
    美海盗暴行变本加厉 
    真理报驻平壤记者报道
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：《真理报》驻平壤记者科尔尼洛夫报道侵朝美海军的暴行称：封锁朝鲜海岸的美国海盗们的行动，最近更变本加厉了，他们有规律地轰击海岸，把通往金刚山的疗养院和休养所的一条窄道置于火力之下，他们轰击渔村，屠杀在他们射程以内的一切生物。
    在三八线地区的朝鲜东海岸小村辅仁里（译音），已被美国军舰从地面上整个扫灭。不久以前在日本海岸定居下来的渔民村落，已不复存在。他们居住的地方，现在已是猛烈轰击所造成的巨大裂制罅和洞穴。
    保卫海上边境的朝鲜战士和水手们，给了侵略者以沉重的打击，在他们的战绩上已有击沉包括一艘巡洋舰在内的数艘美国军舰的纪录。很多保护军舰的美国飞机，被海岸上高射炮手的准确炮火击毁。
    人民的飞行员在仁川区击沉敌人的驱逐舰后回到机场，对向他们庆贺的同志们说：倘若我们未能用我们的炸弹将该艘驱逐舰击沉，我们也将要像苏联英雄格斯特罗所曾做过的那样，宁肯用自己的飞机去猛撞它，也决不容许美国强盗们杀死我们的孩子和母亲、我们亲近的和敬爱的人们。这些话表现了朝鲜人民在反抗美国干涉者时忘我地保卫祖国的感情。
