　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th (TASS): The Soviet Council of Ministers has recently issued a decision on the construction of the Turkmen Main Canal, the construction of sluices and power stations along the river, the construction of water supply canals, and afforestation in the canal area. The decision points out that the construction of the Turkmen Main Canal and other measures will ensure the supply of hydroelectric power for industry and agriculture in the region, the irrigation of newly reclaimed cotton-growing areas, and the diversion of water to the southern districts of the West Turkmen Caspian Lowlands, the lower reaches of the Amu Darya River, and the pastures of the Kara-Kum Desert, as well as further development of the livestock feed base.

　　The decision states: From 1951 to 1957, the Turkmen Main Canal (from the Amu Darya River to Krasnovodsk) will be built, and three sluices and three hydroelectric power stations with a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts each will be built on the Amu Darya River at Takhiatash and along the canal, as well as several large reservoirs and other projects. The Turkmen Canal will be 1,100 kilometers long. The river water will be diverted from the Amu Darya River, with a total water volume of 350 to 400 cubic meters per second, which may be increased to 600 cubic meters per second in the future, not including the amount of water flowing into the Caspian Sea.

　　The decision continues: In order to utilize the Turkmen Main Canal and the Takhiatash sluice to divert water to irrigate newly reclaimed cotton-growing areas and develop agriculture and animal husbandry, large irrigation and water supply canals with a total length of 1,200 kilometers will be built. The water-receiving areas include: 500,000 hectares in the southern part of the West Turkmen Caspian Lowlands, 300,000 hectares in the Amu Darya Delta, 500,000 hectares in the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Republic and the northern part of the Turkmen Republic, and 7 million hectares of pasture in the Kara-Kalpak Desert livestock area. In order to implement the above decision, the Council of Ministers has ordered the establishment of the "Central Asian Hydroelectric Power Station Construction Office" this year to handle the construction of the canal, and has instructed the Hydroelectric Power Station Design Bureau to handle the design, investigation, and research work related to the construction, and instructed the Ministry of Cotton Growing, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of State Farms to conduct surveying, design, and construction of various irrigation and water supply canals, carry out water diversion and irrigation work, and draft various measures to develop cotton growing and animal husbandry.

　　The Council of Ministers has decided to provide a large amount of water to various industrial enterprises, railway transportation, and residential areas in West Turkmenistan, and to plant 500,000 hectares of protective forests along the Grand Canal, irrigation canals, and around the irrigated areas of industrial enterprises and residential areas to fix shifting sand. To this end, the relevant industrial ministries are specifically instructed to start designing, surveying, and laying large water pipes, water supply canals, main water pipes, and pumping stations totaling 1,000 kilometers in length, and the Ministry of Forestry is instructed to carry out afforestation work.

　　The Council of Ministers has also instructed the Inland Water Navigation Department to formulate various measures to ensure the development of navigation on the Turkmen Main Canal.

　　和平政策与不可战胜的力量的生动表现
    苏联决定开凿土库曼大运河
    几年后荒漠就要变成丰饶的果园与牧场
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：苏联部长会议顷发布关于开凿土库曼大运河，并沿河修建水闸及发电站，修筑供水渠、以及在运河区造林等工作的决定。决定指出：建造土库曼大运河及其他措施，将确保该地区工业与农业的水电供应和新开垦植棉地区的灌溉，以及引水到西土库曼里海低地南部各区、阿姆河下流和卡拉·库姆沙漠的牧场，并进一步发展牲畜饲料基地。
    决定称：自一九五一——五七年将建筑土库曼大运河（自阿姆河至克伏斯诺伏斯克），并在阿姆河上的塔赫亚·塔什及运河沿岸建造三座水闸和三个发电能力各为十万千瓦的水力发电站，并兴建几个大蓄水池及其他工程。土库曼运河全长一千一百公里。河水自阿姆河导入，总水量为每秒三百五十至四百立方公尺，将来可能增至每秒六百立方公尺，流入里海的水量尚不计在内。
    决定继称：为了利用土库曼大运河及塔赫亚·塔什水闸，以引水灌溉新开垦的植棉地区并发展农业与牧畜业，将开凿全长一千二百公里的大灌溉渠和供水渠。其受水地区包括：西土库曼里海低地南部五十万公顷，阿姆河三角洲三十万公顷，卡拉·卡尔巴克自治共和国及土库曼共和国北部五十万公顷和卡拉·卡尔巴克沙漠牧畜区七百万公顷的土地。部长会议为实现上述决定，已命令在今年成立“中亚水力发电站建设处”，以处理运河的建设事宜，并责成水力发电站设计局处理与建设有关的设计，调查和研究工作，责成植棉部、农业部及国营农场部从事勘测、设计及建筑各灌溉渠与供水渠，进行引水灌溉工作，以及草拟各项措施以发展植棉与牧畜业。
    部长会议决定要大量供水给各工业企业、铁路运输及西土库曼居民区，并将沿大运河、灌溉水渠及在工业企业与居民区的灌溉地区周围，种植五十万公顷的防护林，以使流沙固定。为此，特责成各有关工业部着手设计、勘测和敷设长达一千公里的大水管、供水渠、总水管和泵水站等，并责成林业部进行造林工作。
    部长会议并已责成内河航运部拟定各项办法，以保证土库曼大运河航运的发展。
