Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The American aggressors are intensifying their efforts to use the Lee Seung-man puppet army as cannon fodder after suffering heavy losses in Korea. According to a Kuomintang Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th, MacArthur "has decided to try integrating South Korean soldiers into the U.S. Army for combat" in order to "replenish the shortfall of American soldiers." It is claimed that "at least one division of the U.S. Army has implemented this method."

Furthermore, according to an Associated Press reporter, Lambert, on the 28th, the losses suffered by the Lee Seung-man puppet army in recent battles are no less than those of the U.S. Army. He quoted an American advisor to the Lee Seung-man puppet army's Third Division as saying that the division "has several companies with only forty soldiers left, and one battalion with only four officers. Some South Korean soldiers who were brought in as replacements were sent to the front line after only a few days of training, and therefore do not even know how to load a bullet."

　　美军侵朝损失惨重
    驱使伪军补充缺额
    【新华社一日讯】美国侵略者在朝鲜遭受惨重损失后，正加紧驱使李承晚伪军作替死鬼。据国民党中央社二十四日电称：麦克阿瑟“已决定试行将韩国军人并入美国陆军中作战”，以此“补充美兵的缺额”。据称：“美军至少有一师已实行这种办法。”
    另据美联社记者兰伯特二十八日透露，李承晚伪军在最近战斗中所受到的损失，并不亚于美军。他引李承晚伪军第三师的美国顾问的谈话称：该师“有几连兵只剩下四十人，某营只有四个军官。有些补充进来的南朝鲜兵士，只经数天训练就派到前线，因而连子弹上膛都不会”。
