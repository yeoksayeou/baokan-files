Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: The national flood control work has now entered its final stage. Various regions are about to begin work on closing breaches and draining water. Since September, among the major rivers nationwide, with the exception of the continuous rise of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, the rise and fall of the Yellow River and the Songhua and Liao River systems in the Northeast have been minimal. The Huai River and Yongding River, on the other hand, are declining daily. The water level at the Chongqing Cuntan station of the Yangtze River began to rise on September 3rd, reaching 173.2 meters by the 15th, an increase of 5.63 meters compared to the 3rd. Wanxian experienced two rises in water level on the 3rd and 11th, with the water level on the 15th rising 8.20 meters compared to the 2nd. Yichang, Jianli, and Chenglingji also experienced two rises in water level on September 5th and September 12th. The water level at the Shanzhou station of the Yellow River rose by 0.01 to 0.07 meters during the week from September 8th to 15th. All other stations have been declining. The water level at various stations in the Huai River basin fell by 0.35 to 0.82 meters from September 8th to 15th. The water level of the Grand Canal fell by 0.73 to 1.81 meters during the same period. All rivers in the Luan and Bai River systems outside Hebei Province are trending downwards. With the exception of the lower reaches of the Daqing River and Yongding River, the flood season ended on September 18th. The flood season in the Northeast rivers ended on September 10th, and reporting stations have been withdrawn. All rivers within Jiangxi Province, except for the Yangtze River levees which must remain fortified, have also been withdrawn from defense.

Analyzing the water situation and considering the current season, the national flood control work has entered its final stage; however, rivers such as the Yellow River and Yangtze River still require vigilance against autumn floods. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has issued instructions, requiring flood control organizations at all levels to conduct thorough inspections once again, and to be vigilant against the possible arrival of autumn floods.

The Autumn Equinox in the lunar calendar has arrived, and the sowing of wheat will soon begin in various regions. Therefore, quickly organizing drainage and land reclamation has become an urgent task. Currently, most of the important breaches in Hebei Province, except for some that are left open for flood discharge, have been closed or are actively preparing materials for closure. According to statistics from the end of August, approximately 70% of the flooded farmland has been reclaimed.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 24th: The water level of the entire Northern Jiangsu Canal has fallen below the designated water level for withdrawing defenses, signifying the successful completion of this year's flood control work for the canal. After submitting a request to the East China Flood Control Headquarters and receiving approval, the Northern Jiangsu Flood Control Headquarters issued an order on September 18th to withdraw defenses.

The Northern Jiangsu Canal is over seven hundred li long. During the Kuomintang's rule, due to prolonged neglect, it often breached due to rising waters from the Huai River. In 1931, the eastward flow of Huai River floodwaters caused a major flood disaster in Northern Jiangsu. This spring, while diverting and managing the Yi River, the Northern Jiangsu People's Government aimed to "ensure that the canal dikes would not breach during a flood as large as the one in 1931," and focused on raising and thickening the canal dike sections. This year, the water level of the Huai River exceeded that of 1931, and the Northern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office immediately mobilized in late July to carry out flood control work, launching the vast population along the river to engage in intense flood prevention work. After more than a month of struggle, this year's flood was finally overcome.

Since the beginning of this year, over 200,000 people have been mobilized along the entire canal line to participate in flood control, rescue, dike protection, and dike repair. The engineering work done during the entire flood season, just in earthwork alone, amounted to over 9 million cubic meters. The successful completion of this year's flood control is due to the efforts of the aforementioned People's Government and the vast population, as well as the relatively weak tidal backwater from the sea during the major flood and the absence of storm attacks, which were also objective and advantageous conditions.

　　全国防汛工作进入末期
    苏北运河水位下落胜利撤防
    黄河长江仍须警惕秋汛
    【新华社二十三日讯】目前全国防汛工作已进入末期。各地即将展开堵口排水工作。自九月以来，全国各大江河，除长江、珠江连续上涨外，其余黄河，东北松、辽河系各河涨落幅度甚微。淮河、永定河则日趋下跌。长江重庆寸滩站自九月三日开始上涨，至十五日水位达一七三·二公尺，较三日上涨五·六三公尺。万县三日、十一日两度涨水，十五日水位较二日水位涨八·二零公尺，宜昌、监利、城陵矶九月五日，九月十二日亦两度上涨。黄河陕州站自九月八日至十五日一周间上涨零·零一至零·零七公尺。其他各站则一直下跌。淮河流域各站九月八日至十五日下跌零·三五至零·八二公尺。运河水位同时期则下跌零·七三至一·八一公尺。河北境外滦白河系各河均趋下跌。除大清河、永定河下游外，已于九月十八日下汛。东北各河自九月十日汛期结束，报汛站已撤。江西省境内各河除长江堤防须设防外，亦均已撤防。
    以水情分析及目前季节看来，全国防汛工作已进入末期；但黄河、长江等河流仍须警惕秋汛。黄河水利委员会已于日前发出指示，要求各级防汛机构再次切实进行检查，警惕可能到来的秋汛。
    现农历秋分节已至，各地小麦播种即将开始。因此，迅速组织排水脱地，已成当前紧急任务。目前河北全省重要决口除有的决口留作泄水之外，大部已堵复或积极备料准备堵复。据八月底统计，被淹耕地已脱出百分之七十左右。
    【新华社上海二十四日电】苏北运河全线水位均已降至规定的撤防水位以下，今年运河的防汛工作即告胜利完成。苏北防汛指挥部经呈请华东防汛总指挥部批准后，已于九月十八日下令撤防。
    苏北运河共长七百余里，国民党统治时期，因长久失治，常因淮河涨水引起溃决。一九三一年即因淮河洪水东下，曾造成苏北的大水灾。今春苏北人民政府在导治沂河同时，曾以“确保运堤在一九三一年的大水时不溃决”为目标，有重点地加高培厚了运河堤段。今年七月淮河水位超过了一九三一年，苏北人民行署即于七月下旬紧急动员进行防汛工作，发动了沿河广大人民，展开了紧张的防汛工作。经一个多月的搏斗，终于战胜了今年洪水。
    今年以来运河全线共发动了二十余万群众参加防汛抢险、护堤和修堤。整个汛期所作的工程，仅土方一项即达九十余万公方。今年防汛得以胜利完成，除上述人民政府与广大人民的努力外，大汛期间江潮顶托较轻，亦未发生风暴袭击，也是客观的优越条件。
