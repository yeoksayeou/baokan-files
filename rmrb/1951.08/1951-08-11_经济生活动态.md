    Serious Bureaucratic Style of Some Flower Collection Groups in Lingbao County, Henan

    The patriotic cotton selling and storage campaign in Lingbao County, Henan Province, has achieved considerable success. However, some flower collection groups in the county have serious bureaucratic styles, which deserve attention. For example, the Guozhen District flower collection group, fearing trouble, stopped in-depth publicity and investigation after a period of collection, and simply asked township cadres to "guarantee" that "not even a tael of cotton is left." The township cadres had no choice but to ask the masses to "guarantee." In fact, the masses still had cotton in storage, but because they had made "guarantees" and written "promises," they dared not bring it out. Gao Fuyou, a hired peasant from Sunjiagou, had been growing cotton for five or six years and had accumulated more than 450 catties of cotton. At first, he was unwilling to take it out; after propaganda and education, he raised his awareness and brought more than 100 catties to the flower collection group for the first time. At that time, there were some yellow flowers, and he also put them on top to be weighed. The flower collection group did not check carefully and classified it as third-grade cotton (it should have been classified as medium-grade). When the cotton was turned over, it was found that the bottom was all good cotton, but they did not correct the grade, which made Gao Fuyou so angry that he refused to take out the rest. The flower collection group's adoption of this erroneous approach caused great dissatisfaction among the masses and seriously hindered the further development of the cotton selling and storage campaign. It should be corrected immediately.

            A Rationalization Proposal by Song Baoming Saves Ten Laborers Per Day for Two Shifts

    In the past, the coal chute (a tool for transporting coal) in the 807 coal mining area of the No. 6 well of the Datong Coal Mine was only moved by the night shift. Therefore, the chute of the early shift was close to the coal face, and it was easier for the loaders to load the chute, and the coal output was also higher. However, in the second shift, because the distance between the chute and the coal face increased (by about two meters or more) after the early shift had produced coal, it was necessary to shovel the coal in front of the chute before loading it into the chute. This was time-consuming, labor-intensive, and did not produce much coal. After the trial implementation of charting in this mining area, each shift stopped coal production half an hour earlier, and the remaining time was used to tidy up the working face (the coal mining work area). Song Baoming (a Communist Party member), the leader of the 807 group, had thought in the past: If the early shift could move the chute, it would reduce labor and increase coal output. Now that he saw that there was more than half an hour of idle time, he proposed that the early shift move the chute for the second shift, and the night shift move it more extensively (that is, the early shift helps the second shift prepare the working conditions, and the night shift prepares the working conditions for tomorrow). The leading cadres thought it was feasible. The first day when the chute was moved, it only took ten minutes, and as a result, the second shift overfulfilled its task. After this was done, each group was reduced from 35 people in the past to 30 people now, saving ten laborers per day for two shifts. Now the 805 mining area has also implemented this method, and each group has reduced five people at the same time. A total of four groups have reduced twenty people per day. The wages saved from the twenty people are equivalent to more than 120 points, which are added to the wages of the remaining 120 people, increasing the daily wage of each person by more than one point. Moreover, the output has greatly increased. The creative spirit of Comrade Song Baoming is worthy of praise.

    河南灵宝县部分收花组官僚主义作风严重
    河南灵宝县爱国售棉储棉运动是有相当成绩的。但该县某些收花组存在着严重的官僚主义作风，值得提起警惕。如虢镇区收花组因怕麻烦，在收购了一个时期以后，即不再深入宣传，也不再调查研究，就叫乡干部“具结”，保证“不存一两花”，乡干部只得叫群众“具结”。西王区的收花组则叫群众写“保证书”。事实上群众是还有存棉的，因具了“结”，写了“保证书”，就不敢再拿出来了。孙家沟雇农高福有种了五、六年棉花，积存棉花四百五十多斤，开始时不愿拿出来；经过宣传教育，觉悟提高了，第一次背了一百多斤到收花组。当时还有一些黄花，他也拿来放在上面去过秤。收花组不仔细检查，就订为三等花（本来应订中等）。倒花时发现下面全是好花，也不订正，气得高福有再也不愿拿出其余的来了。收花组采取这种错误的作法，使群众大为不满，严重妨害售储棉运动的进一步开展，应立即纠正。
            宋宝明的一件合理化建议使每天两个班可省十个工
    大同煤矿二矿六号井八○七回采区的煤溜子（运煤的工具）过去只是由晚班移。因之，早班溜子离煤面近，装溜子的不费劲，出的煤也比较多。但到二班时，因早班出煤后，溜子至煤面的距离加长了（约增二公尺多），所以装煤的时候必须先把煤铲到溜子前然后再往溜子里装。这样，又费时间，又费工，又出不多煤。在这次该回采区试行图表制后，每班提前半个钟头停止出煤，剩下时间整理掌子面（采煤工作场所）。八○七大组长宋宝明（共产党员）在过去就想过：如果早班能移溜子的话，就可以减少人工，而且也可以多出煤。现在一看有半点多钟的闲时间，他就提出来早班给二班移溜子，晚班再大移（即早班帮助二班准备工作条件，晚班为明天的工作准备条件）。领导干部认为可以。头一天移溜子的时候，仅十分钟就移好了，结果二班超额完成了任务。这样作了之后，每个组由过去的三十五人减到现在的三十人，每天两个班可省十个工。现在八○五回采区也这样实行了，同时每组都减少了五个人。共计四个组每天减少二十人。节省下二十人的工资折合一百二十多个分，加在剩下的一百二十人的工资里，每人每日的工资提高了一个多分。而且产量大大地增加。像宋宝明同志这种创造的精神是值得表扬的。
