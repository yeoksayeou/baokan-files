　　I Should Not Blindly Support Wu Jindong, Wu Xun's Successor, in "Promoting Education"
　　Ma Jinghan

　　I made the mistake of blindly praising Wu Xun and supporting Wu Jindong, Wu Xun's successor, in "promoting education."

　　In September 1949, the higher authorities assigned me to serve as the Deputy Commissioner of the Liaocheng Special District in Pingyuan Province. In January 1950, Sun Yu and Zhao Dan, carrying a letter of introduction from the Shandong Provincial People's Government, went to Wu Xun's hometown to film exterior shots for the movie "The Story of Wu Xun." At that time, we not only introduced them to the Tangyi County People's Government but also instructed the county's Education Section to assist them. Later, around May or June of that year, Wu Jindong came to the Liaocheng Special Commissioner's Office, and I also wrote an inscription on his donation book. I remember the original words were: "Carry on Mr. Wu Xun's legacy and continue to strive for the development of new democratic education!" At the time, it never occurred to me whether I should use the Special Commissioner's Office's name to introduce Sun Yu to film the movie, or personally write an inscription for Wu Jindong to support his "education promotion" activities. I did not realize that Wu Jindong's purpose in asking me to write an inscription was to get me to help him deceive the masses. I also did not anticipate that Wu Jindong would intentionally place my inscription on the first page of his fundraising book to deceive, confuse, and intimidate the masses. This was my serious political error.

　　Today, I realize that the main reason for making this error was not simply blind action, nor liberalism, but primarily a lack of political awareness, unclear class boundaries, and failure to see the reactionary nature of Wu Xun's "begging for education." This was due to my blurred class consciousness and the political blind action generated under the support of petty-bourgeois individual feelings and old moral concepts.

　　After this period of study, I have indeed received a lot of education. First, I understand the reactionary essence of Wu Xun's "begging for education;" thus, I have a clearer understanding of the seriousness of my mistake in blindly supporting Wu Xun. I must further participate in the study of criticizing "The Story of Wu Xun," and I am determined to continue examining my erroneous thoughts and improve my political level in this study movement.

### 我不该盲目支持武训继承人武金栋的“兴学”

　　我不该盲目支持武训继承人武金栋的“兴学”
    马景汉
    我犯了盲目赞扬武训与支持武训继承人武金栋“兴学”的错误。
    一九四九年九月，上级派我到平原省聊城专区任副专员，一九五○年一月，孙瑜、赵丹拿着山东省人民政府介绍信，去武训家乡摄制《武训传》电影外景。当时我们不但把他们介绍到堂邑县人民政府，并叫该县教育科予以协助。后来大约是在这年的五六月间，武金栋来聊城专署，我又在他的捐款本子上题了词，我记得原文是：“承武训先生遗志，继续为发展新民主主义教育事业而奋斗！”在当时我完全没有想，我是否应该用专署的名义介绍孙瑜去摄制电影，或以个人名义为武金栋题词，支持他捐款“兴学”的行动。我没有认识到武金栋要求我给他题词的目的，是要我去帮助他欺骗群众。我也没有估计到武金栋有意的把我的题词放在他募捐本子的第一页上，用以去欺骗迷惑与吓唬群众。这是我的严重政治错误。
    我今天觉悟到犯这个错误的重要原因，不是单纯的盲目行动，也不是自由主义，主要的是政治觉悟不高，阶级界线不明确，没有看到武训“行乞兴学”的反动本质。这是由于我的阶级意识模糊，而在小资产阶级的个人情感与旧道德观念支持下产生了政治上的盲目行动。
    经过了这一段的学习，我确实受到了不少的教育，首先是懂得武训“行乞兴学”的反动实质；因而，也就更明确认识了自己盲目支持武训错误的严重性。我必须再进一步参加批判《武训传》的学习，决心在这个学习运动中继续检查我的错误思想，提高我的政治水平。
