　　Heighten Vigilance, Resolutely Suppress American Special Agent Spies
　　Zeng Yi
　　The Beijing Military Control Commission has sentenced a major case of American special agent spies plotting an armed rebellion. We are delighted and we resolutely support it.
　　The Chinese people have stood up, shattering the imperialist conspiracy of aggression. We are not only inflicting fatal blows on the enemy on the Korean battlefield, but we have also achieved brilliant victories on the "invisible front."
　　The correct measures of the Beijing Military Control Commission are fully in line with the demands of the Chinese people. Only in this way can we consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship. Chairman Mao once clearly told us: "If the revolutionary people do not learn this method of ruling the counter-revolutionary classes, they will not be able to maintain their power, and their power will be overthrown by internal and external reactionaries, internal and external reactionaries will be restored in China, and the revolutionary people will suffer." How can we be willing for the revolutionary people to suffer? How can people who love the people, love the motherland, and love peace be willing for the revolutionary people to suffer? Therefore, we resolutely support all measures to suppress imperialist special agent spies.
　　Ever since the imperialists invaded China, they have been arbitrarily ruining the Chinese people, exploiting the Chinese people, and massacring the Chinese people without being punished; on the contrary, they were regarded as foreign masters and foreign fathers by those traitorous governments and foreign slaves. Only today is the first time that we are punishing the evildoers who harm the interests of the Chinese people in accordance with our own Chinese laws.
　　From the handling of this issue, we ourselves have also received some education.
　　Imperialism is attempting to undermine the cause of the Chinese people at all times and in all places, and this is its essence. But the Chinese people are wise and good at accepting historical experience. After the October Revolution, how imperialism treated the Soviet Union is still remembered by the people. Therefore, the people are vigilant and do not hold any illusions about imperialism. Wherever its claws reach, we will chop them off; wherever its pig snout reaches, we will smash it.
　　Perhaps some people still harbor some undue sympathy for the dying beast; this is wrong. Tolerance of counter-revolution is cruelty to the people, and it will also cause the revolutionary people to suffer.
　　The hideous face of the imperialists is exposed so clearly. Our people will fight even more strongly. We resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's separate peace with Japan and oppose U.S. imperialism arming Japan.

　　提高警惕，坚决镇压美国特务间谍
    曾毅
    北京市军事管制委员会判处了美国特务间谍阴谋武装暴动的巨大案件。我们欢欣鼓舞，我们坚决拥护。
    中国人民站起来了，粉碎了帝国主义的侵略阴谋。我们不但在朝鲜战场上予敌人以致命的打击，就是在“无形战线”上，也同样取得了辉煌的胜利。
    北京市军事管制委员会的正确措施，是完全符合中国人民要求的。只有如此，才能巩固我们的人民民主专政。毛主席曾经明白地告诉我们：“革命的人民如果不学会这一项对待反革命阶级的统治方法，他们就不能维持政权，他们的政权就会被内外反动派所推翻，内外反动派就会在中国复辟，革命的人民就会遭殃。”我们怎能愿意革命的人民遭殃呢？热爱人民、热爱祖国、热爱和平的人们，怎能愿意革命的人民遭殃呢？所以我们坚决拥护一切镇压帝国主义特务间谍的措施。
    帝国主义者自从侵入中国那一天起，一直是任意糟塌中国人民，剥削中国人民，屠杀中国人民，而不受惩罚的；相反的，却被那些卖国政府和洋奴捧为洋大人，洋爸爸。只有今天才是第一次照着我们中国人民自己的法律来惩办危害中国人民利益的恶徒们。
    从这个问题的处理上，使我们本身也受到了一些教育。
    帝国主义无时无地不在企图破坏中国人民的事业，这是它的本质。但中国人民是智慧的，是善于接受历史经验的。十月革命后，帝国主义如何对待苏联，人民还记忆着。所以人民是警觉的，不对帝国主义抱有任何幻想。它的魔爪伸到哪里，我们就把它斩断在哪里；它的猪嘴伸到哪里，我们就把它敲碎在哪里。
    或许有人对垂死的恶兽还要寄与一些不应该有的怜悯，这是错误的。对反革命的容忍就是对人民的残忍，同样会使革命的人民遭殃。
    帝国主义者的狰狞面目，暴露得如此明显。我们人民将愈加坚强地斗争。我们坚决反对美帝国主义对日单独媾和，反对美帝国主义武装日本。
