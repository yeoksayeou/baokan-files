Should Respect and Cherish the National Flag, National Emblem, and National Anthem

The national flag, national emblem, and national anthem represent the dignity of our great People's Republic of China. Every patriotic person should respect and cherish the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem.

According to readers' letters to this newspaper, some people still lack due attention to respecting and cherishing the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem. The national flags hung in some places do not meet the standards. For example, readers Zou Chunmao from the Ninth District People's Government of Ningxiang County, Hunan, and Zhu Shouqian from Shixia Town, Miyun County, Hebei, wrote that they have found that many national flags made locally do not meet the standards: some are square, some have all five stars in white, and some even have five stars of the same size arranged in the center and four corners of the red background. Some places also have phenomena of misusing the national flag and national flag patterns, such as using the national flag as decorations, curtains, or backdrops, or using the national flag pattern as a trademark. Reader Wu Zhengang from the Xianyou County People's Government in Fujian wrote: a bone-made "poker" sold in the county market has a national flag pattern engraved on one card (readers from Beijing, Hebei, Heilongjiang, and other places also wrote that the "poker" made locally uses the flag of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the hammer and sickle as patterns). Li Fuan, a Young Pioneer from Beijing, pointed out that a photo studio in Beixinqiao, Beijing, uses the national flag and military flag as a photo background. In addition, some stationery stores also alter the national flag pattern and print it on notebooks for sale.

The Central People's Government has explicit regulations regarding the use of the national emblem. The People's Daily editorial on September 20 last year, "Respect the National Emblem, Cherish the National Emblem," also pointed out that "printed materials with the national emblem pattern should not be discarded everywhere." However, some people still do not pay enough attention to this. For example, reader Yang Zhaogeng from Beijing wrote that a comrade in their organization pasted the People's Daily, which published the national emblem pattern, on the wall and arbitrarily damaged the national emblem pattern.

Many readers' letters also pointed out some phenomena of disrespecting the national anthem: for example, some people hum the national anthem as a ditty while walking or playing, and even arbitrarily alter the lyrics of the national anthem in a very unserious manner. Some military bands even arbitrarily play the national anthem or the military song of the People's Liberation Army in wedding and funeral ceremonies.

All of the above situations are extremely bad and intolerable. Our national flag, national emblem, and national anthem all represent the dignity of our country. Seeing the solemn and beautiful national flag and national emblem, and hearing the solemn and majestic national anthem, we can recall the heroic and arduous revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people to win today's victory; we cannot forget the heroic deeds of countless patriotic people and revolutionary martyrs; we seem to see the greatness and abundance of the motherland and its far-reaching and glorious future. Therefore, cherishing and respecting the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem is a manifestation of loving the motherland and is the duty of patriotic people. It is wrong to regard respecting and cherishing the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem as unimportant. Relevant authorities should conduct patriotic education on respecting and cherishing the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem among the people, and formulate specific measures to prevent the occurrence of misuse and abuse of the national flag and national emblem.

We must love and respect the national flag, national emblem, and national anthem, and contribute all our strength to our great and lovely motherland!

### 应该尊敬与爱护国旗国徽国歌

专栏：来信综述

　　应该尊敬与爱护国旗国徽国歌
    国旗、国徽和国歌都代表着我们伟大的中华人民共和国的尊严。每个爱国的人民都应该尊敬和爱护国旗、国徽和国歌。
    根据本报读者来信反映，有一些人对尊敬和爱护国旗、国徽和国歌还缺乏应有的注意。有些地方悬挂的国旗不合标准。如湖南宁乡县第九区人民政府邹春茂和河北密云县石匣镇朱寿先等读者来信说，他们都发现当地有很多国旗制作得不合标准：有的是正方形的，有的五颗星都用白色，还有的竟是五颗同样大小的星分列在红底的中心和四角。有些地方还有滥用国旗和国旗图案的现象，如把国旗作为装饰品、窗帘或幕布等，或把国旗图案用作商标。福建仙游县人民政府读者武振纲来信指出：该县市上出售的一种骨制“扑克牌”中，有一张刻着国旗图案（还有北京、河北、黑龙江等地读者来信指出，当地所制“扑克牌”中有用中国人民解放军军旗及镰刀锤子作图案的）。北京市少年儿童队员李富安指出北京北新桥某照相馆以国旗及军旗作为照相背景。此外，有些文具店还把国旗图案加以纂改印在出售的笔记本上。
    关于国徽使用办法，中央人民政府曾有明文规定。去年九月二十日本报社论《尊敬国徽，爱护国徽》中并指出，“印有国徽图案的印刷品，不要随处抛弃”。但还有些人对此注意不够，如北京市读者杨肇庚来信指出，他们机关中某同志就把公布国徽图案那天的人民日报糊墙，并且任意将国徽图案污损。
    很多读者来信中又指出了一些不尊敬国歌的现象：如有些人在走路、闲玩时把国歌当小调哼唱，甚至还极不严肃地把国歌歌词任意纂改。有些军乐队在婚丧仪式中竟任意吹奏国歌或人民解放军军歌。
    以上这些情况，都是极端恶劣而使人不能容忍的。我们的国旗、国徽和国歌都是代表我们国家的尊严的。看到庄严美丽的国旗、国徽，听到庄严雄伟的国歌，我们就可以回想起中国人民为争取今日的胜利而进行的英勇艰苦的革命斗争；我们就不能忘记无数爱国志士和革命先烈的英勇业迹；我们就像看到祖国的伟大丰饶及其远大光辉的前程。因此，爱护和尊敬国旗、国徽和国歌就是热爱祖国的表现，是爱国人民的义务。一切把尊敬和爱护国旗、国徽和国歌看作无关重要的事情，都是错误的。有关机关应该对人民进行尊敬和爱护国旗、国徽和国歌的爱国主义教育，并订出具体办法以防止滥用、滥作国旗、国徽现象的发生。
    我们要热爱和尊敬国旗、国徽和国歌，并为我们伟大可爱的祖国贡献出一切力量！
