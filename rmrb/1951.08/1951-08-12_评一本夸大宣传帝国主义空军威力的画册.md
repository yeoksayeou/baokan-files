　　Review of a Picture Album Exaggerating the Power of Imperialist Air Forces
　　Tong Ge
　　"Modern Air Force Weapons," one of the Popular Science Illustrated series. Edited by Xue Hongda, written by Xi Wencheng, and illustrated by Ge Xin. Published by Shanghai Popular Science Society. Printed by Shanghai East China Bookstore, published in March 1951.

　　This is an illustrated picture album that exaggerates the power of the air forces of American, British imperialism, and Hitler's Germany. The book contains a total of 33 pages of pictures and text introducing airplanes, of which 19 pages are about American airplanes, 3 pages about British airplanes, 4 pages about Hitler's German airplanes, and 6 pages about Soviet airplanes. There is one page comparing Soviet airplanes with American airplanes. Judging from these quantities, readers will get the impression that the United States has the most types of airplanes. The illustrations provide detailed introductions to American airplanes, such as "the B-36 bomber can carry 84,000 pounds of bombs," and when introducing the B-24 heavy bomber, the airplane in the picture fires artillery in all directions, and giant bombs fall one after another; and when introducing the B-29 heavy bomber, it says: "In addition to carrying nearly 20 tons of bombs, it also carries a large number of bullets and cannon shells." In addition to this, the author also made many exaggerated evaluations of the aircraft of imperialist countries, such as praising the German Junkers bomber by saying, "Germany's victory in the early stage of World War II was due to the large-scale use of this type of bomber," and another picture shows "the Junkers plane in a dive bombing scene." Also, he praised German fighter planes for "excellent weapons, high efficiency, solid structure, and powerful combat power," introduced the American P-39 fighter as "able to exert full power," and the British Mosquito fighter as "having strong combat performance," and so on. Therefore, although there are also some pictures and texts introducing Soviet airplanes, the editors obviously intentionally adopted such untrue comparisons, making readers feel that the author is focusing on describing the power of the imperialist, especially American imperialist, airplanes. The author of this picture album seems to have completely forgotten a fundamental fact, that is, in World War II, Hitler's Germany was defeated by the Soviet Union in all aspects, and the United States and Britain could not help but marvel at the invincible power of the Soviet Union in World War II.

　　This picture album is full of malicious distortions of the facts in comparisons. For example, in the same picture, the American P-38 fighter is shown, marked "maximum speed of 400 miles per hour," while the speed of the Soviet fighter is "360 miles per hour" (page 16). It also indicates that the maximum speed of the American jet bomber is 630 miles per hour (page 44), while the speed of the Soviet jet bomber is only 450 miles per hour and 472 miles per hour. In fact, even American imperialists admit that "Soviet jet aircraft have superior performance," but the author of this book continues to foolishly boast about the superior performance (speed) of American airplanes.

　　Chen Tong, the publisher of "Popular Science Illustrated," made a statement on the last page of the picture album, saying: "Since the CPPCC, in the Common Program, indicated a clear path for publishing, which is national form, scientific content, and mass direction, and accepted Chairman Mao's instruction to 'do a good job in publishing,' it inspired my determination to compile and print this series of books." However, this picture album obviously does not conform to the spirit of the Common Program. The Common Program stipulates that we must eliminate imperialist ideology, but this picture album focuses on promoting the murderous weapons of fascist countries. Therefore, this is a picture album with serious errors, which should be corrected, and it is hoped that the Popular Science Society will re-examine its other "scientific illustrations" for erroneous ideas.

　　评一本夸大宣传帝国主义空军威力的画册
    彤哥
    《现代空军兵器》，大众科学图说之一。薛鸿达主编·席文成撰文·葛辛绘图。上海大众科学社出版。上海华东书店印行，一九五一年三月出版。
    这是一本夸大宣传美、英帝国主义以及希特勒德国的飞机威力的图解画册。全书介绍飞机的图文共三十三页，而介绍美国飞机的就占十九页、英国飞机三页、希特勒德国的飞机四页、苏联飞机六页，以苏联飞机和美国飞机作比较的共一页。从这些数量上来看，就会使读者得出一个印象，以为美国拥有最多种类的飞机。图解对于美国飞机的介绍是详细的，例如说“Ｂ３６轰炸机可以载炸弹八万四千磅”等等，又如介绍Ｂ２４重轰炸机时，图中的飞机向四周发射炮火，巨型炸弹纷纷落下；又如介绍Ｂ２９重轰炸机时说：“除携带近二十吨的炸弹外，并带有大量的枪弹、炮榴弹”。除此而外，作者还做了许多夸大的对帝国主义飞机的评价，例如称赞德国容克轰炸机时说：“第二次世界大战初期，德国取得胜利是大量采用此种轰炸机的”，另一图并画着“容克机在俯冲轰炸的景象”。又如称赞德国战斗机“武器精良，效率高超，结构坚固，作战时威力强大”，介绍美国Ｐ３９驱逐机“能够发出十分的威力”，英国蚊式战斗机“作战性能强”等等，因此虽然也有一些介绍苏联飞机的图和文字，但编绘者显然有意采用了这样不合事实的比较，使读者感到，作者是在着重的描写帝国主义，尤其是美帝国主义的飞机威力。这本画册的作者似乎完全忘记了一个根本的事实，这就是第二次世界大战中，希特勒德国无论在任何方面都被苏联所击败了，而美英各国在第二次大战中也不能不惊叹苏联的无敌力量。
    在这本画册中充满了恶意的歪曲事实的对比。例如在同一画面中画着美国Ｐ３８战斗机，标明“最高速率达每小时四百英里”而苏联战斗机的速率却是“每小时三百六十英里”（第十六页）。又如它标明美国的喷气轰炸机的最高速率是每小时六百三十英里（第四四页），而苏联喷气轰炸机的速率每小时就只是四五○英里和四七二英里。其实，连美帝国主义分子也自供“苏联的喷气式飞机性能优越”，而这本书的作者却继续愚妄地为美国飞机的优越性能（速率）作着无聊的吹嘘。
    《大众科学图说》的出版者陈通曾在画册的末页作了自述，他说：“自从人民政协在共同纲领内，指示了一条明确的出版道路，就是民族的形式，科学的内容，大众的方向，并且接受了毛主席的‘认真作好出版工作’的指示，就启发了我编印本丛书的决心”。但是这本画册显然是不符合共同纲领的精神的。共同纲领中规定要肃清帝国主义的思想，可是这本画册却着重地宣传着法西斯国家的杀人武器。因此这是一本有着严重错误的画册，应当予以纠正，希望大众科学社重新检查其它的“科学图说”有无错误思想。
