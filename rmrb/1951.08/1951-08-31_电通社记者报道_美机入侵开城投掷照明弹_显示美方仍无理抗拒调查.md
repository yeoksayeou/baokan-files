Electric News Agency Reporter Reports:
    U.S. Plane Invades Kaesong and Drops Flares
    Showing the U.S. Side Still Unreasonably Refuses Investigation
    (Xinhua News Agency, August 30th) Electric News Agency reporter Shen Jiantu reported from Kaesong on the 29th: At 2:40 this morning (the 29th), just as Ridgway was about to deliver a broadcast reply, U.S. bombers roared over Kaesong and dropped flares by parachute as a threat. The flare light illuminated the sky, foreshadowing Ridgway's impolite refusal to reinvestigate the Kaesong bombing incident.
    I was awakened by the rumbling of the planes and saw the flares flashing, drifting westward with the wind. People at the conference residence confirmed that the parachute flares were dropped by B-26 bombers directly north of the meeting site, and the planes then circled back in the direction of the flares. People stationed here believe that the continuous violations of the Kaesong neutral zone by American planes after the bombing incident on August 22nd are a threat to bomb Kaesong and stop the peace talks.
    People here believe that Ridgway's refusal to reinvestigate is out of fear of facing the results of a reinvestigation and to cover up the outrageous lies he has spread to the world. Although many reporters and official statements have indicated that the Kaesong delegation is waiting for U.S. liaison officers to reinvestigate, they have not come, and Ridgway's reply this morning is still full of lies.
    Ridgway's categorical refusal to reinvestigate has made it clear to the world that he is deliberately rejecting a sincere suggestion that could break the deadlock. The arrogance of this refusal has reached an extreme level, making it clearly unacceptable, and is a clear indication of the Pentagon's policy - closing all doors to reopening negotiations.

　　电通社记者报道
    美机入侵开城投掷照明弹
    显示美方仍无理抗拒调查
    【新华社三十日讯】电通社记者沈建图二十九日自开城报道：在今（二十九日）晨两点四十分，李奇微快要发表广播答复的时候，美军轰炸机轰鸣在开城上空，并且用降落伞投下了照明弹进行威胁，弹光烛天，预示着李奇微将无礼拒绝重新调查开城轰炸事件的恶兆。
    我被隆隆的机声惊醒，看见照明弹光焰闪闪，随风向西飘荡。会议寓所的人士证实，降落伞照明弹是Ｂ二十六型轰炸机在会议地址正北投下的，以后飞机就朝着照明弹的方向盘旋飞回。驻在这里的人士都认为，在八月二十二日的轰炸事件以后美国飞机连续侵犯开城中立区，是要轰炸开城并使和平谈判停止的威胁。
    这里人士认为，李奇微拒绝重新调查，是害怕面对重新调查的结果，并想掩饰他向全世界所撒的漫天大谎。虽然许多记者与官方声明都表示开城的代表团正在等待美国联络官重新调查，但他们并没有来，而李奇微今晨的答复依然扯谎。
    李奇微断然拒绝重新调查，已使全世界明白看出，他是故意拒绝可能打破僵局的诚恳的建议。这次拒绝的措辞，其蛮横程度已达于极点，显然令人不能接受，这是五角大楼政策的明显的表示——关闭一切重开谈判的大门。
