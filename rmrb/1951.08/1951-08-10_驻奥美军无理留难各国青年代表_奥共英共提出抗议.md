　　Xinhua News Agency, August 8th dispatch from Vienna: The Chairman of the Austrian Communist Party and member of parliament, Mr. Koreny, sent a letter to the Austrian Chancellor Figl and Vice-Chancellor Schärf, protesting the unreasonable obstruction by the American occupation authorities and the Austrian government of nearly two thousand youth representatives from countries such as Britain, France, and Switzerland from traveling to Berlin to participate in the World Youth and Student Peace Festival. Koreny said: These young people are still being blocked in Tyrol and Vorarlberg, and their freedom is being severely violated. This matter is in conflict with Austrian law and the people's ideals of basic democratic rights and freedoms. Not long ago, when warmongers held a fascist demonstration in West Germany under the guise of a "paratrooper gathering," foreign fascists passed through Austria to West Germany without any obstruction. However, violence and harassment are being inflicted on these foreign young people who are going to Berlin to participate in the festival in order to strive for peace and mutual understanding among countries, which cannot but cause particular indignation. Koreny pointed out: The measures taken against young peace fighters not only greatly damaged Austria's international prestige, but also mocked Austria's sovereignty, but the Austrian government has not yet lodged any protest with the US and British occupation authorities. On the contrary, it is urging Austrian officials to participate in this violent act. Koreny finally demanded that the Austrian government immediately protest against this behavior of restricting the freedom of travel of young peace fighters and take all measures to allow the nearly two thousand young people who are currently being harassed in Austria to pass through Austria.
　　
　　Another dispatch: The Deputy Secretary of the British Communist Party, Matthews, also issued a statement on the 5th, protesting against the American occupation authorities in Austria for preventing the British youth delegation from passing through Austria to Berlin to participate in the festival. He also called on every Communist Party member and Communist Youth League member in Britain to lodge a strong protest against this behavior of the American occupation authorities.

　　驻奥美军无理留难各国青年代表
    奥共英共提出抗议
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社维也纳消息：奥地利共产党主席、议员柯伦尼致函奥总理费格尔和副总理谢尔夫，抗议美国占领当局和奥地利政府无理阻挠英国、法国和瑞士等国的青年代表近二千人前往柏林参加世界青年与学生和平联欢节。柯伦尼说：这些青年现在仍然被阻在蒂罗尔和佛拉尔堡，而且他们的自由受到严重的侵犯，这件事情是跟奥地利法律和人民对各种基本民主权利和自由的理想相抵触的。不久前战争贩子们在西德以“跳伞家集会”为名举行法西斯示威的时候，外国法西斯分子曾毫无阻碍地通过奥国往西德去。而对于这些为争取和平和各国间互相谅解而到柏林去参加联欢节的外国青年则施以暴力和横加留难，不能不令人特别感到愤慨。柯伦尼指出：对于各国青年和平战士所采取的措施，不仅大大损害了奥地利的国际威望，而且是对奥地利主权的嘲弄，但奥国政府到现在仍未向美英占领当局提出任何抗议，相反却督促奥国官员参加这种强暴的行为。柯伦尼最后要求奥地利政府立即对此种限制青年和平战士旅行自由的行为提出抗议，并采取一切措施使现在被留难在奥国的近二千青年通过奥地利。
    又讯：英国共产党副书记马修斯亦已于五日发表声明，抗议奥境美国占领当局阻止英国青年代表团路经奥地利前往柏林参加联欢节，他并号召英国的每一个共产党员共产主义青年团员对美国占领当局的此种行为提出强硬的抗议。
