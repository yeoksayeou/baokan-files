　　Pay Attention to the Timeliness of Propaganda Materials
  (I) Comrade Editor:
    The blackboard bulletins in Xuanhua City, Chahar Province, are very untimely in publicizing current affairs. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will correct this immediately.
    Xuanhua City's two most prosperous streets, South Street and Gulou Southkou Street, both have blackboard bulletins. However, until August 13th, these two blackboard bulletins still displayed the news of "Agreement reached on the agenda of the Korean armistice talks." At that time, U.S. imperialism had already put forward unreasonable demands for a military demarcation line, revealing its attitude of sabotaging the armistice talks. The blackboard bulletins, however, did not promptly inform the masses of the new news, which made the masses' understanding lag behind the situation. For example, on August 10th, I asked a resident of the city: "How are the Korean armistice talks going?" He said: "Didn't they already agree on the meeting agenda?"
    It is hoped that the relevant departments in Xuanhua City will pay attention to this issue and correct the shortcomings of untimely propaganda.

  (II) Comrade Editor:
    The Xinhua Bookstore window on Wangfujing Street in Beijing once displayed a statistical table of national donations of airplanes and cannons. The People's Daily published on August 4th that the Southwest Region had donated 190 airplanes; however, until August 10th, the statistical table still showed 161 airplanes. The window of the power bureau charging station in Dongdan Santiao Hutong in Beijing often uses blackboards to write some important news; however, sometimes the content is not updated in a timely manner. For example, the news of the resumption of the Korean armistice talks was published in the August 11th newspaper, but the blackboard still showed the news of the suspension of the armistice talks. In addition, some trolleybuses in Beijing also have blackboard bulletins. As far as I have seen, there are often many outdated news items on them.
    This situation may also exist in other places. Therefore, I hope that everyone will pay attention to the timeliness of propaganda work so that our propaganda work can play a greater role.

### 注意宣传材料的时间性

　　注意宣传材料的时间性
  （一）编辑同志：
    察哈尔省宣化市有些黑板报宣传时事很不及时，希望有关机关即予纠正。
    宣化市最繁华的两条大街，南大街和鼓楼南口街，都设有黑板报。但直到八月十三日，这两个黑板报上还登着“朝鲜停战谈判会议议程达成协议”的消息。那时，美帝国主义已经提出了不合理的军事分界线要求，显露了它破坏停战谈判的态度。但黑板报却没有及时把新的消息告诉群众，就使群众的认识落后于形势，如我在八月十日问该市一个居民：“朝鲜停战谈判怎么样了？”他说：“不是把会议议程都商量好了吗？”
    希望宣化市有关部门注意这个问题，纠正宣传不及时的缺点。

  （二）编辑同志：
    北京王府井大街新华书店橱窗内曾陈设有全国捐献飞机大炮的统计表。八月四日人民日报刊载：西南区捐献飞机已达一百九十架；而直到八月十日，该统计表上还写着一百六十一架。北京东单三条胡同电业局收费处的橱窗内，经常用黑板写着一些重要新闻；但有些时候内容变换得不够及时。如八月十一日的报上已登出朝鲜停战谈判复会的消息，该处黑板上还写着停战谈判停顿的消息。此外，在北京市有些电车上也设有黑板报。据我所见，上面也常常有许多消息是过了时的。
    这种情况，其他地方可能也有。因此，我希望大家注意宣传工作上的时间性，使我们的宣传工作起更大的作用。
