Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 13th: Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, held a meeting of representatives of the people of the old revolutionary base areas and families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary workers from the 10th to the 12th of this month. The meeting focused on reviewing the work of preferential treatment over the past two years. At the meeting, Fu Qiutao, head of the Xiang-E-Gan sub-delegation of the Central People's Government Southern Old Revolutionary Base Area Delegation, conveyed Chairman Mao's cordial concern and instructions to the people of the old revolutionary base areas, praised the county's achievements in preferential treatment work, and emphasized: The restoration of the economic construction of the old revolutionary base areas has only just begun today, and in the future, the economic, cultural, and health construction of the old revolutionary base areas will be restored in a planned and step-by-step manner. We must ensure that the people of the old revolutionary base areas live better lives. The representatives enthusiastically discussed Chairman Mao's instructions, promising to rebuild their homes destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries with their own hands, to complete the donation of a "Pingjiang Old Revolutionary Base Area" fighter plane after the autumn harvest, to actively participate in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, consolidate national defense, and strive for greater glory.

Pingjiang County was a major part of the Xiang-E-Gan old revolutionary base area during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. At that time, land reform was implemented in about two-thirds of the county, and a worker-peasant democratic government was established. After the main force of the Red Army went on the Long March, the people of Pingjiang continued to persist in the revolutionary struggle. Over the past 20 years, more than 120,000 workers and peasants have sacrificed themselves in the county. Even today, many deep valleys and caves are still full of bones. Some places are uninhabited for dozens of miles. There are more than 30,000 households of martyr's families, military families, and workers' families in the county, accounting for 20% of the county's population. Under the long-term devastation and persecution by the Kuomintang reactionaries, their lives are generally very difficult. In the two years since liberation, the People's Government has successively distributed more than 2.5 million catties of rice for preferential treatment, and has focused on helping 16,861 households of martyr's families, military families, and workers' families to solve their living problems. In the rural social reform movement, 314 martyr's families, military families, and workers' families have been trained and promoted to become revolutionary cadres, and more than 300 martyr's families, military families, and workers' families have found employment through introductions. At the same time, the People's Government has also planned to restore Pingjiang's native products. At present, tea gardens have been restored to 70%, papermaking has been restored to 20%, and Pingjiang cloth, which is famous throughout the country, has also been restored to 70%.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 13th: The meeting of representatives of the people of the old revolutionary base areas and families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary workers in Pingjiang County sent a telegram to Chairman Mao. The text of the telegram is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

On August 9th, the Xiang-E-Gan sub-delegation of the Central People's Government Southern Old Revolutionary Base Area Delegation you personally sent arrived in Pingjiang. We convened a meeting of representatives of the people of the old revolutionary base areas and families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, with more than 300 representatives participating, and held a joint celebration with them.

Chairman Mao, we know that you are very concerned about our lives and struggles. Before and after the Great Revolution, when you led us in Hunan to make revolution and the Autumn Harvest Uprising, you gave us strong confidence. Since the Red Army went north to resist Japan, we have persisted in the struggle, and our hearts have always been with the Communist Party. We are confident that with your leadership, we will definitely win, because Mao Zedong is victory!

Chairman Mao, the people of the old revolutionary base areas deeply realize that the longer you and the Red Army leave us, and the more difficult the war, the stronger and more solid our revolutionary feelings become. When we saw the delegation you sent, it was as if we saw you in person. We were extremely happy, and we couldn't help but feel tears wetting our clothes. Among the gifts the delegation gave us were your inscription and commemorative badge. Your inscription calls on us to "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory!" We keep these two sentences in our hearts, as they indicate the goal of our actions. We guarantee to you that we will definitely strive for greater glory in restoring the economic construction of the old revolutionary base areas and in the patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. At present, thanks to the help of the People's Government and the efforts of the broad masses of people, the lives of the people in the Pingjiang old revolutionary base area are guaranteed, and the fields and gardens destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries are beginning to be restored. We have put the relief grain distributed by the government into production and will never rely solely on government relief. We have two hands and are not afraid of any difficulties.

Dear Chairman Mao, we, the people of the old revolutionary base areas, know that today's victory did not come easily. We all clearly realize how much it cost to build today's people's motherland. Therefore, in order to defend the fruits of victory and to love our country, we are actively launching the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, increase production patriotically, and donate airplanes and cannons. We have decided that the donation of a "Pingjiang Old Revolutionary Base Area" fighter plane will be completed after the autumn harvest. We have all signed patriotic covenants. After the meeting, we will also bring your call and your concern for us to all the people of the county and to every household of martyrs, soldiers, and workers. We are determined to implement your call—"Strive for greater glory." We wish
Chairman Mao eternal health and eternal leadership in leading us forward!

Pingjiang Old Revolutionary Base Area People and Representatives of Families of Martyrs, Soldiers, and Workers

　　平江举行老根据地人民及烈军工属代表会议
    中央访问团传达毛主席的关怀和指示
    会议致电毛主席保证执行指示争取更大的光荣
    【新华社长沙十三日电】湖南省平江县在本月十日至十二日举行了老根据地人民及革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命工作人员家属代表会议。会议着重检查了二年来的优抚工作。在会议上，中央人民政府南方老根据地访问团湘鄂赣分团团长傅秋涛传达了毛主席对老根据地人民的亲切关怀和指示，表扬了该县的优抚工作的成绩，并着重指出：恢复老根据地的经济建设，今天还刚刚开始，今后将有计划有步骤地恢复老根据地经济、文化、卫生建设事业，一定要使老根据地人民生活过得更好。代表们热烈地讨论了毛主席的指示，保证用自己的双手，重建被国民党反动派摧毁的家园，保证在秋收后，完成捐献一架“平江老根据地号”战斗机，积极参加抗美援朝，巩固国防，争取更大的光荣。
    平江县为第二次国内革命战争时期湘鄂赣老根据地的主要部分，当时全县约三分之二的地区实行了土地改革，建立了工农民主政权。在红军主力长征后，平江人民仍继续坚持革命斗争。二十多年中，全县牺牲的工农群众达十二万余人，许多深谷山洞中，直至今天尚白骨累累，有些地方数十里路无人烟。全县烈属、军属与工作人员家属达三万多户，占全县人口百分之二十，在国民党反动派长期摧残迫害下，一般生活都很苦。解放二年来，人民政府先后发放了优抚粮二百五十多万斤大米，有重点地帮助一万六千八百六十一户烈属、军属与工作人员家属解决了生活问题。在农村社会改革运动中，有三百一十四位烈属、军属与工作人员家属被培养和提拔成为革命干部，有三百多位烈属、军属、工作人员家属经介绍谋得了职业。同时，人民政府并有计划地恢复平江土产。现茶园恢复了百分之七十，造纸业恢复了百分之二十，驰名全国的平江土布也恢复了百分之七十。
    【新华社长沙十三日电】平江县老根据地人民及革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命工作人员家属代表会议致电毛主席，电文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    八月九日，你亲自派来的中央人民政府南方老根据地访问团湘鄂赣分团到了平江。我们召开了三百多名代表参加的老根据地人民及烈、军、工属代表会，和他们举行联欢。
    毛主席，我们知道你十分关怀我们的生活与斗争。大革命前后，你在湖南领导我们闹革命和秋收起义时，给了我们以坚强的信心。自从红军北上抗日后，我们一直坚持斗争，我们的心一直向着共产党。我们确信：有你的领导，就一定要胜利，因为毛泽东就是胜利！
    毛主席，老根据地的人民深切的体会到：你和红军离开我们愈久，战争愈艰苦，我们的革命感情就愈增强愈牢固。当我们看到你派来的访问团时，就好像看到你本人一样，我们高兴极了，不觉得一颗颗的泪珠打湿了衣襟。访问团送给我们的礼品中，有你的题字和纪念章。你的题词号召我们“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣！”我们把这二句话，记在自己心上，这是指示我们行动的目标。我们向你保证：我们一定要在恢复老根据地的经济建设和在抗美援朝爱国运动中争取更大的光荣。目前由于人民政府的帮助和广大人民的努力，平江老根据地人民的生活有了保障，被国民党反动派破坏了的田园正在开始恢复，我们已把政府发下的救济粮投入了生产，决不单纯依靠政府救济。我们生着两只手，决不怕任何困难。
    亲爱的毛主席，我们老根据地人民知道今天的胜利来之不易。我们都认识得很清楚：今天人民的祖国是用多么大的代价建筑起来的。因此，为了保卫胜利果实，为了热爱祖国，我们积极展开抗美援朝、爱国增产、捐献飞机大炮的运动。我们决定捐献的一架“平江老根据地号”战斗机在秋收后就要完成。我们都订立了爱国公约。开完会后，我们还要把你的号召和你对我们的关怀，带给全县人民和每一户烈、军、工属。我们决定要执行你的号召——“争取更大的光荣”。祝
    毛主席永远健康，永远领导我们前进！
