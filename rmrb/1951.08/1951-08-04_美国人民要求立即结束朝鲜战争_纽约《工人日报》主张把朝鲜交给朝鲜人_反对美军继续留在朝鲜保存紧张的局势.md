　　American People Demand Immediate End to the Korean War
    New York "Daily Worker" Advocates Handing Korea Over to the Koreans
    Opposes Continued Stationing of American Troops in Korea to Preserve Tension
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 3rd dispatch] New York news: The movement demanding an immediate end to the Korean War is developing further within the United States. According to a report in the New York "Daily Worker" on July 29, in Detroit, Hood, the secretary of Local 600 of the United Auto Workers Union at Ford, sent a telegram to President Truman urging an immediate ceasefire in Korea and the cancellation of the "state of war emergency" order. This action by the Ford Company's union was in response to a letter from Sherrill, the chairman of the Labor Peace Conference, to one hundred national union leaders. This letter requested that telegrams or letters be sent to President Truman to support a ceasefire.
    Reverend Upham, the director of the American Peace Crusade, also wrote to Truman, pointing out that the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, which Washington has refused, has now aroused widespread discussion in the United States, reflecting the feelings of the majority of the American people.
    The staff of the University Department of the "American Youth for Progress Association" in New York City urgently requested that Truman do everything possible "to ensure the continuation of the current negotiations and to make them successful in ending the Korean War."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 3rd dispatch] The New York "Daily Worker" editorial on July 27 stated: "When the first step towards a ceasefire in Korea has been agreed upon, we should not forget that the main thing the people must still win is to get our children out of Korea forever. The negotiators from Korea and China have agreed to leave this issue for later discussion, but this does not mean that we at home should also leave this issue for later discussion."
    The "Daily Worker" continued: "Washington's plan to continue to stay in Korea is deeply contrary to American interests, because the purpose of this plan is to preserve the tension in Korea, making a new war in that area inevitable. The military plan to occupy half of Korea indefinitely only means a new attempt to invade and conquer North Korea; it also only means that it will provoke new military action by the Chinese people to defend their vital northeastern border, and at the same time it will generate new MacArthur-style demands for bombing China, thus opening the road to a world war that every sober-minded American seeks to avoid."
    The "Daily Worker" concluded: "The best way to save American lives from future destruction on the distant Asian continent is to hand Korea over to the Koreans and sincerely cooperate with China and the Soviet Union to seek a peaceful solution for the whole of Asia. The best guarantee against a new war is such a peaceful solution and not stationing American troops on the doorstep of other countries' people around the world."

　　美国人民要求立即结束朝鲜战争
    纽约《工人日报》主张把朝鲜交给朝鲜人
    反对美军继续留在朝鲜保存紧张的局势
    【新华社布拉格三日电】纽约消息：要求立即结束朝鲜战争的运动正在美国国内进一步发展着。据纽约《工人日报》七月二十九日报道，在底特律城，联合汽车工人工会福特公司第六百分会秘书胡德曾致电杜鲁门总统，力促立即在朝鲜停火并取消“战时紧急状态”令。福特公司工会的这种行动，是对劳工和平会议主席谢若尔写给全国一百个工会领袖的一封信的响应。这封信要求发电报或写信给杜鲁门总统来支持停火。
    美国和平十字军干事乌法斯牧师也写信给杜鲁门指出：被华盛顿所拒绝的一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题，现已在美国国内引起广泛讨论，这反映了大多数美国人民的心情。
    纽约市“美国进步青年协会”大学部工作人员迫切要求杜鲁门竭尽所能“来保证继续进行现在的谈判，并使之得到成功，以结束朝鲜战争”。
    【新华社布拉格三日电】纽约《工人日报》七月二十七日的社论写道：“当朝鲜停火的第一步措施已获得协议的时候，我们不应忘记，人民仍必须赢得的主要事情是使我们的孩子们永远离开朝鲜。朝鲜和中国的谈判代表已同意把这个问题留待以后讨论，但是这并不就是说我们在国内的人也应把这个问题留待以后讨论。”
    《工人日报》接着说：“华盛顿想继续留在朝鲜的计划是深深地违反美国利益的，因为这个计划的目的在于保存朝鲜的紧张局势，使该地的新战争成为不可避免。无限期地占领半个朝鲜的军事计划只意味着有侵略和征服北朝鲜的新企图；也只意味着会引起中国人民保卫他们至关紧要的东北边境的新的军事行动，同时也会产生新的麦克阿瑟式的轰炸中国的要求，这样就打开了走向每个头脑清醒的美国人所力求避免的世界大战的道路。”
    《工人日报》最后说：“拯救美国人的生命免得将来毁灭在遥远的亚洲大陆上的最好办法，是把朝鲜交给朝鲜人，并诚恳地和中国及苏联合作，以谋得全亚洲的和平解决。预防新战争的最好保证，是这样的和平解决并且不在世界各地其他国家人民的门前驻扎美国军队。”
