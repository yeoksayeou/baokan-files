　　Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Dynamics
　　Nanjing Deepens Patriotic Movement
　　The Nanjing Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Branch announced on August 7th a decision to further promote the patriotic pact and increase production and donations. The decision stipulates: (1) In the future, in addition to arranging work from top to bottom according to the system, the branch must systematically use various forms to directly conduct publicity and education work for grassroots cadres and the people. It will regularly hold meetings of all police station chiefs, household registration officers, civil affairs cadres, and activists among residents in the city to carry out publicity and education on anti-American aggression and patriotic education. (2) Organize publicity and inspection teams for the three major tasks, focusing on factories and rural areas, and conduct spot checks in streets, families, and shops. Combine current affairs propaganda with patriotic education during the inspection process, and submit the inspection results and problems found to the branch for discussion in order to formulate solutions in a timely manner. (3) In addition to organizing publicity and inspection teams to check the signing and revision of patriotic pacts, the decision is to cultivate typical examples among people from all walks of life, from small to large, from point to surface, and systematically organize patriotic pact competitions. (4) The branch will hold a series of meetings (focusing on industrial and commercial households and residents) to study the problems in increasing production and donation work, in order to correct deviations in the movement in a timely manner, assist various systems in overcoming difficulties, and formulate practical working methods.
　　Xi'an Factories Revise Patriotic Pacts
　　From mid-July, the Xi'an Enterprise Party Committee and the Xi'an Federation of Trade Unions inspected the implementation of patriotic pacts in 21 factories and enterprises, and focused on revising and enriching the patriotic pacts. After being educated in the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the political consciousness of workers and staff in factories and enterprises in Xi'an has generally improved. They have successively signed patriotic pacts or production guarantee conditions to challenge the Ma Hengchang Group. According to statistics, workers and staff in 13 trade union systems in the city participated in this movement, which has greatly promoted the enthusiasm of workers and staff for production, strengthened patriotic education, and improved factory management and labor-management relations. However, it was found during the inspection that many of the previous patriotic pacts of the city's workers and staff were ineffective. The main reason is that some leading cadres neglected publicity and education, adopted the method of contracting and signing on behalf of others, and there were too many types of pacts, making it impossible for workers and staff to concentrate on their goals. To this end, the Xi'an Enterprise Party Committee and the Xi'an Federation of Trade Unions are currently focusing on helping the trade unions of various factories to launch studies to revise the pacts, and are conducting deliberation and discussion in groups, merging and revising the original patriotic pacts and guarantee conditions into patriotic competition pacts.
　　Southwest Minority Areas Further Promote Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement
　　The Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement in the minority areas of Southwest China has been further developed. After attending a representative meeting and understanding the significance of the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement, minority representatives in Longli County, Guizhou Province, put forward the slogan "One letter per family, propaganda to everyone." By June 14, the minority people of the county had written 24,623 letters to comfort the Volunteer Army. Minority women in the Dongshan area of Kaiyuan, Yunnan, accused American imperialists of raping seven minority women in a church in the area. This accusation aroused their anger towards American imperialism. A poor peasant woman mobilized 107 people to write letters to the Volunteer Army, asking the Volunteer Army to avenge them. After carrying out current affairs studies, 70% of the students at the Southwest Nationalities Institute requested to go to the Korean front to kill the enemy. Currently, the movement to donate airplanes and artillery is underway in minority areas. Within a few days after the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea General Association issued its call, the people of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang donated more than 140 million yuan.

　　抗美援朝动态
    南京市进一步深入开展爱国运动
    南京市抗美援朝分会于八月七日发布关于进一步推进爱国公约与增产捐献工作的决定。决定规定：（一）今后除按照系统自上而下地布置工作外，分会必须有计划地运用各种形式，直接面向基层干部与人民群众进行宣传教育工作，定期分别举行全市各派出所长、户籍员、民政干事、居民中的积极分子的会议，进行抗美援朝爱国主义的宣传教育。（二）组织三大工作的宣传巡视组，有重点下厂下乡，深入街巷、家庭、商店实行抽查。在检查过程中结合时事宣传进行爱国主义教育，并将检查结果与所发现的问题，提交分会讨论，以便及时订出解决问题的办法。（三）除组织宣传巡视组检查爱国公约订立与修订的情况外，决定在各界人民中均采取培养典型，由小到大，由点到面的办法，有计划地组织爱国公约的竞赛运动。（四）分会将分别召开一系列的会议（重点放在工商业户及居民系统中），研究增产捐献工作中的问题，以便及时纠正运动中的偏向，协助各系统克服困难，并制订切实可行的工作方法。
    西安市各工厂修订爱国公约
    西安市企业党委和西安市总工会，七月中旬起分别在二十一个工厂、企业单位内检查了爱国公约的执行情况，并有重点地展开了修订和充实爱国公约的工作。西安市各工厂、企业单位的职工，经过抗美援朝及镇压反革命运动的教育后，政治觉悟普遍提高，纷纷订立了爱国公约或向马恒昌小组应战的生产保证条件。据统计，全市有十三个工会系统职工，参加了这一运动，对发挥职工的生产热情，加强职工爱国主义教育，改进工厂管理和劳资关系等方面都起了很大的推动作用。但从检查中发现，该市职工过去的爱国公约有许多不起作用。主要原因是：某些领导干部忽视宣传教育，采用包办代订的办法，而公约的种类又太多，使职工的奋斗目标不能集中。为此，西安市企业党委和西安市总工会目前正在有重点地帮助各厂工会发动职工展开修订公约的学习，并以小组为单位进行酝酿、讨论，把原来的爱国公约和保证条件，合并修订为爱国竞赛公约。
    西南少数民族地区进一步开展抗美援朝运动
    西南各少数民族地区的抗美援朝运动，已有进一步的开展。贵州龙里县的少数民族代表在开过代表会议，了解了抗美援朝运动的意义以后，提出了“每家一封信，逢人便宣传”的口号。到六月十四日止，该县少数民族人民已写了二万四千六百二十三封信慰问志愿军。云南开远东山区的少数民族妇女，曾控诉美国帝国主义分子在该地教堂内，奸污七名少数民族妇女的罪行。这个控诉会激起了她们对美帝国主义的愤怒。一位贫农妇女发动了一百零七人写信给志愿军，要求志愿军为她们报仇。西南民族学院在开展时事学习以后，百分之七十的学生要求到朝鲜前线去杀敌。目前，捐献飞机大炮运动已在少数民族地区展开。西康藏族自治区人民，在抗美援朝总会发出号召以后的几天中，即捐献了人民币一亿四千余万元。
