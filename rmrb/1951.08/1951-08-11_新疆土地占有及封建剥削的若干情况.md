　　Several Situations Regarding Land Ownership and Feudal Exploitation in Xinjiang
　　Zheng Guangzhi
　　The agricultural and pastoral laborers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have not only historically suffered from the national oppression of the reactionary ruling class's Great Han chauvinism, but have also long suffered from the extremely cruel oppression and exploitation by local ethnic landlords, princes, heads of thousands and hundreds of households, pastoral owners, and others within their own ethnic groups. This can be clearly seen from Xinjiang's land ownership and its severe land rent exploitation, the extra-economic exploitation of unpaid labor, and the oppression of serfdom and slavery. Since the liberation of Xinjiang, after more than a year of work, the political consciousness and class consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups have been considerably raised. They firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the feudal system will be completely eliminated, allowing them to gain further liberation.

　　Concentration of Land Ownership
　　In the agricultural areas of Xinjiang, commonly known as oases in the desert, land ownership is quite concentrated. Landlords, who account for about five to six percent of the total number of rural households, generally own about fifty percent of the land; in some places, landlords, who account for only two to three percent of the total number of rural households, own as much as eighty to ninety percent, or even one hundred percent of the land, while poor and hired peasants, who account for sixty to seventy percent of the total number of rural households, own no land or very little land. Looking at the entire Xinjiang, the concentration is even more severe in southern Xinjiang than in northern Xinjiang. For example, in Shufu County, landlords occupy fifty percent of the 600,000 mu of arable land; in Cele County, landlords own 220,000 mu of the county's total 300,000 mu of arable land, accounting for more than 73 percent of the county's total land; in Mikeli Village, Yecheng County's eighth district, all 7,600 mu of arable land are owned by seven landlord families, and the remaining 39 households do not own an inch of land. In many counties in southern Xinjiang, there are countless landlords who own thousands or even tens of thousands of mu of land and tens of thousands of livestock. For example, the large landlord Aimalaheqi in Hotan County, with a family of five, owns more than 50,000 mu of land. Although land ownership in northern Xinjiang is more dispersed than in southern Xinjiang, it is extremely unbalanced, and the degree of land concentration is very high in some places. In Yili Da Danmutu Village, 232 out of 310 households in the village own no land, accounting for 74.8 percent of the total number of households; in the seventh township of Ningxi County, landlords, who account for only 1.3 percent of the total number of households in the township, own as much as 90 percent of the land and 67 percent of the livestock. In Kumake Village, Emin County, more than 66 percent of the peasants do not own an inch of land.

　　Severe High Land Rent Exploitation
　　Relying on the large amount of land they own, the landlord class carries out severe high land rent exploitation of the vast number of peasants. The rent generally accounts for more than 50 percent of the harvest, and in some cases as high as 70 to 80 percent. In the event of a poor harvest, the rent actually paid by the peasants often exceeds the actual yield. For example, in a township in the seventh district of Hotan, the poor peasant Rouzimaitieshake rented 2.8 mu of land, and due to a poor harvest last year, only harvested 25 "chengzi" of grain [Note 1], while the rent actually paid was 33 "chengzi", accounting for 124 percent of the harvest. The poor peasant Yimingtuohe said: "I rented 0.7 mu of land from Ari Tahong, with a rent of 9 'chengzi'. Due to lack of fertilizer, I only harvested 3 'chengzi', wasting my efforts and losing 6 'chengzi'." In the "eight kinds of crops" tenant farming system in Shache (the most common and complex tenant farming system in Xinjiang), the rent generally accounts for 75 to 90 percent of the income. - In this type of tenant farming, the landlord usually provides the land and water, as well as part or all of the production materials needed by the tenant (such as seeds, farm tools, and draft animals), and the tenant provides labor and part of the production materials, as well as "Wu Su'er grain" [Note 2] and unpaid labor. The rent for generally fixed rent arrangements is also as high as 80 percent or more. For example, the poor peasant Jiamalibake Shawuer Rouzi in Shache County rented 3.5 mu of land from the landlord Haiheqihan in 1950. The yield was 45 "chengzi", and 20 "chengzi" were paid as rent. Adding the wages for 35 days of compulsory labor (in the past, compulsory labor was two to three days a week, and a total of 35 days were worked in 1950), the landlord actually took 87 percent of the total output. The rent for newly reclaimed wasteland by peasants also accounts for more than 50 percent. For example, in a township in the seventh district of Hotan, eight households, including the poor peasants Mohammati and Shajiwuma, reclaimed 51 mu of wasteland belonging to the landlord Da Aji (everything was provided by the tenants), and two-thirds of the harvested alfalfa (only alfalfa can be grown on newly reclaimed wasteland in southern Xinjiang in the first few years) was paid as rent. Deceiving peasants into reclaiming new wasteland is one of the most vicious exploitative means used by landlords. For example, the landlord Ma Shengwang in Nongguanzhuang, Qiantun County, deceived peasants into reclaiming the wasteland he had seized, and then increased the rent year by year, or forced them to plant bad land, or after the peasants had managed it for several years and turned it into good land, he adopted the method of seizing the tenancy and transferred the land to others at a high rent. Under the threat and oppression of this rent increase, planting bad land, and seizing tenancy, the tenant Ma Zhicai lost 24 shi of seeds in three years.

　　Extra-Economic Exploitation of Unpaid Labor
　　The extra-economic exploitation of unpaid labor is a very common form of exploitation in southern Xinjiang. In southern Xinjiang, the general situation is that peasants rent a small amount of barren land from landlords, and in addition to the men having to work for the landlords for 20 to 25 days a month, the women also have to help with cooking and washing clothes. For example, in a village in Moyu County, all 91 households work for the landlord, and except for 27 households who have purchased very little land and farm tools in the past 13 or 14 years, the remaining 64 households still own nothing. The landlord rents them a small amount of land to cultivate (the land tax is also paid by the peasants), and the remaining land is all cultivated by the peasants of the whole village without compensation; some have been cultivating it for several generations. Another example is in the second township of the second district of Shache, where the landlord Ayup only rented out 20 mu of land to seven tenants in order to exploit a large amount of unpaid labor, leaving a large amount of land to be cultivated entirely by exploiting unpaid labor. The hired peasant Kuwan cultivated 5 mu of his land and had to provide six months of unpaid labor throughout the year. In addition to hiring more than 150 workers, the large landlord Ayiberkehan in Yecheng also ruled 77 serfs. These serfs cultivated a small amount of barren land for him and had to do five days of unpaid labor for him every week. In addition, some landlords often use their usual rogue and bullying methods to force a large number of peasants to work for them for free during the busy farming season. For example, the local bully landlord Imonbek in Moyu County forced a large number of peasants to work for him all day for free like driving sheep, without even giving them food. When the peasants asked him for food, he said: "You bastards haven't accomplished anything, and you still want to eat!" The peasants who were forced to work not only could not eat all day long and could not earn wages, but also suffered his beatings.

　　Oppression of Serfdom and Slavery
　　The working people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang not only suffer from severe rent exploitation and extra-economic exploitation of unpaid labor by the feudal landlord class economically, but also suffer all kinds of insults and abuses politically. In some places, landlords still adopt the exploitative methods of ancient slavery and medieval serfdom to oppress countless working people, making them unable to get enough food and clothing all year round, living a life worse than animals, and often with no guarantee of life. For example, during the grain requisition last autumn in Yutian County, southern Xinjiang, a village with a plantation similar to a slave society was discovered. Among the 72 households in the village, except for the large landlord Anderda, the remaining 71 households lived a slave-like life. Anderda owns all the land, houses, livestock, farm tools, water mills, oil mills, and everything else in the village, and regards all the peasants in the village as his private property. These slaves have nothing, and at the same time, due to the pressure of life, they owe him debts; after working hard for a year, the account shows that it is not enough to pay Anderda's interest. Anderda uses this high-interest usury to tightly bind all the peasants in the village like an iron rope, making them have no freedom of action and always suffering his cruel exploitation. Some peasants who could not bear this exploitation and ran away were caught back by Anderda and subjected to torture, and some lost their lives as a result. When the great local bully Ma Tingxiang in Shanshan County got married, he bought a peasant, Maisimu, to serve his wife, and cut off Maisimu's testicles, making him infertile. Maisimu has lived a slave life for 40 years. The local bully landlord Maimaitierli in Qiemo County ruled more than 100 slaves. These slaves not only often suffered beatings and lost their human rights, but also often suffered inhuman insults. The slaves' daughters were often raped by Maimaitierli at will. Maimaitierli had the "right of the first night" when the slaves got married.
　　The disasters suffered by women among the working people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are even more tragic. They not only suffer from feudal oppression, but also suffer inhuman and barbaric devastation and humiliation such as polygamy and early marriage. The rape of peasant women by local bullies in many places is appalling. For example, the great local bully Imonbek in Moyu County has raped 116 young girls in his 54 years before this year. The wives of his workers cannot go home to sleep without his permission. One night, she went home to sleep, and the next day she was beaten to death by Imonbek, and finally her hair was burned off with a torch. The great local bully Aini in Yili has raped more than 700 women, and 16 young girls have died under his bestial rape. Aini still occupies more than 70 women.

　　People of All Ethnic Groups Firmly Believe: Under the Leadership of the Communist Party, Feudalism Can Be Eliminated!
　　After the liberation of Xinjiang, the common enemy of the people of all ethnic groups—the trinity of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism that weighed on the Chinese people, with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang as its last representative—was overthrown, but the rural feudal forces, which often colluded with imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism to oppress the people, have not been eliminated. They still carry out illegal and cruel oppression and exploitation of the vast number of peasants. Since the liberation of Xinjiang, under the correct policy guidance of the Communist Party, the Xinjiang People's Government, the People's Army, and the people of all ethnic groups have united and carried out many tasks such as suppressing bandits, production, reasonable burden, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and trying out rent reduction. The political consciousness and class consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups have been considerably raised. From many specific examples in the past year, they have realized that only the Communist Party and the People's Government can help them to turn over. In order to obtain their true and complete liberation, they urgently demand to be organized to overthrow landlords and local bullies, carry out the struggle to reduce rent and oppose local bullies, and liberate themselves from the oppression of the feudal class. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang who have awakened have a very high enthusiasm for the struggle to reduce rent and oppose local bullies. For example, when the first township of Hotan County, southern Xinjiang, tried out rent reduction, the peasants of the second township automatically organized to reduce rent from the landlords. In areas where rent reduction trials have been carried out, peasants demand that land reform be implemented as soon as possible. When the Provincial People's Representative Conference opened, peasants and women from all over the country gathered to accuse the crimes of landlords and local bullies, and wrote letters to the Provincial People's Representative Conference, requesting the formulation of rent reduction measures. Because social order has been stabilized, the consciousness of the masses has been considerably raised, the organizations of peasant associations have been established in many places, and a group of local ethnic cadres have emerged and been cultivated, and foreign cadres have a general understanding of the local situation and have established certain connections with the local masses, which has created conditions for carrying out social reform in the vast rural areas. Therefore, when the masses demanded to carry out the struggle to reduce rent and oppose local bullies, the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government accepted this urgent demand of the vast number of peasants, and after discussion and approval by the Provincial People's Representative Conference, decided to mobilize the masses to carry out the struggle to reduce rent and oppose local bullies in the agricultural areas of nine districts with a population of nearly 4 million this winter and next spring. This timely resolution was warmly supported by peasants of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The peasant representatives from all over the country at the Provincial People's Representative Conference unanimously said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, our peasants of all ethnic groups have the confidence to eliminate feudalism thoroughly and step by step!"
　　In order to lead the people to eliminate feudalism step by step, liberate rural productive forces, and help peasants of all ethnic groups turn over, the Party and the People's Government of Xinjiang are training a large number of ethnic cadres in units of special districts and counties, and transferring 10,000 cadres from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang and provincial party and government organs to provide them with short-term training, so that they can become familiar with the relevant policies and strategies, learn how to divide classes and mobilize and organize the masses, draw on the typical experience of the rent reduction trial last autumn, and then send them to various places to participate in and guide this movement. At the same time, due to the unprecedented increase in class consciousness, the vast number of people of all ethnic groups in various places are also uniting more closely to automatically assist the government in exposing counter-revolutionaries and welcome the unprecedented peasant emancipation movement in Xinjiang's history.

　　[Note 1] Chengzi - Uighur called "Karazi", which is a commonly used unit of weight calculation in Xinjiang folk. The weight represented by each place is also different. Kashgar and Aksu generally call "one Karazi" equal to 16 old jin, while in Shache area "one Karazi" is equal to 12 old jin.
　　[Note 2] Wu Su'er grain - This was a burden on religion for peasants in the past. For every stone of grain harvested, one dou of "Wu Su'er grain" had to be handed over, which was later changed to be handed over to educational institutions run by the Uighur or Kazakh cultural associations, but most of it was embezzled by a few people. After the liberation of Xinjiang, the cultural associations of various ethnic groups in various places were taken over by the Xinjiang People's Democratic League.

　　新疆土地占有及封建剥削的若干情况
    郑广智
    新疆各民族的农、牧业劳动人民，不但在历史上长期受着反动统治阶级大汉族主义的民族压迫，而且长期受着当地民族内部的地主、王公、千百户长、牧主等极其残酷的压迫与剥削。这从新疆的土地占有及其严重的地租剥削，无偿劳动的超经济剥削，以及农奴与奴隶制的压榨可以清楚地看出。新疆解放以来，经过一年多的工作，各族人民的政治觉悟与阶级觉悟有了相当的提高，他们深信在共产党领导下，一定能彻底消灭封建制度，使自己获得进一步的解放。
            土地占有的集中
    俗称沙漠中的绿洲的新疆各地农业区，土地占有是相当集中的。占农村总户数百分之五、六的地主，一般均占有百分之五十左右的土地；甚至在某些地方仅占农村总户数百分之二、三的地主，竟占有土地百分之八、九十以至百分之百，而占农村总户数百分之六、七十的贫雇农民却没有土地或很少土地。从全新疆来看，南疆较北疆集中程度尤甚。如疏附全县六十万亩可耕地，地主即占去百分之五十；策勒县全县共有耕地三十万亩，为地主占有者即达二十二万亩，占全县总土地百分之七十三以上；叶城县八区米克力村有耕地七千六百亩全部为七家地主占有，其余三十九户没有分寸土地。在南疆许多县拥有数千亩以至数万亩的土地和数万只牲畜的地主是不胜枚举的，如和阗县大地主艾买拉合齐全家五口人即有土地五万余亩。北疆的土地占有虽较南疆分散，但极不平衡，有些地方土地集中程度也很高。叶伊犁大旦木图村，在全村三百一十户中，就有二百三十二户没有土地，占总户数百分之七十四点八；宁西县第七乡仅占全乡总户数的百分之一点三的地主，占有土地竟达百分之九十，占有牲畜百分之六十七。额敏县库马克村，百分之六十六以上的农民无分寸土地。
            严重的高额地租剥削
    地主阶级依靠其占有的大量土地，对广大农民实行着严重的高额地租剥削，其租额一般占收获量百分之五十以上，有的高达百分之七、八十。遇有歉收时，农民实缴租额常常超过实产量。如和阗七区一乡，贫农肉孜买提沙的克租地二亩八分，去年因歉收只收粮二十五秤子〔注一〕，而实缴租额三十三秤子，为收获量的百分之一百二十四。贫农依明托合说：“我租阿日他洪七分地，租子九秤子，因缺粪只收了三秤子，白费工夫还赔了六秤子。”莎车八样伙种地的租佃形式（这是新疆最普遍最复杂的租佃形式），租额一般占收入百分之七十五至九十。——此种租佃形式，通常是地主除出土地和水外，并供给承租人所需生产资料（如种籽、农具、耕牛等）之一部或全部，佃户出劳力及一部生产资料与出“吾受尔粮”〔注二〕和无偿劳动。一般定租租额也有高达百分之八十以上的。如莎车县贫农加马力八克沙吾尔肉孜，一九五○年租地主海黑其汗三亩半地，产量四十五秤子，出租二十秤子，加上义务劳动三十五天（过去每星期义务劳动两天到三天，一九五○年共出义务劳动三十五天）的工资计算，地主实际上占去总产量的百分之八十七。农民新开的荒地，租额也占百分之五十以上。如和阗七区一乡，贫农莫汗买提、沙加五马等八户，新开地主大阿吉荒地五十一亩（一切均由佃户出），所收苜蓿（南疆新开荒地最初几年只能种苜蓿）三分之二交了租子。骗使农民新开荒地，是地主最毒辣的一种剥削手段。如乾德县农官庄地主马生旺骗使农民把他霸占的荒地开垦后，逐年增加租额，或者强迫带种坏地，或者经过农民经营数年变成好地后，采取夺佃办法将地夺去，另以高租额转租他人。佃户马志才在这种加租、带种坏地、夺佃的威胁压榨下，三年内赔了二十四石种子。
            无偿劳动的超经济剥削
    无偿劳动的超经济剥削，是南疆非常普遍的剥削形式。在南疆一般情形是农民租种地主少量的瘠地，除男人每月须有二十天至二十五天的时间给地主做工外，女人还须帮助做饭洗衣服。如墨玉县一个村子，九十一户人家全部给地主种地，其中除了二十七户在最近十三、四年购买了很少一些土地农具外，其余六十四户直到现在一无所有。地主租给他们以少量土地耕种（田赋粮也由农民出），其余土地全部由全村农民无偿耕种；有的已经耕种了好几辈子。又如莎车二区二乡，地主阿尤普为了剥削大量无偿劳动，仅出租二十亩地即分给七个佃户，留下大量土地全由剥削无偿劳动来耕种。雇农库万种了他五亩地，全年得白出六个月无偿劳动。叶城大地主阿衣伯克汗除雇工一百五十余人外，还统治着七十七个农奴，这些农奴种上他少量瘠地，每礼拜要给他做五天的无偿劳动。此外，有些地主往往以其惯用的无赖恶霸手段，在农忙时强迫大量农民白白给他们做工，如墨玉县恶霸地主伊蒙别克像赶羊似的强迫大量农民整天给他白做工，连饭都不给吃。当农民们向他要求吃饭时，他却说：“你们这些坏蛋什么也没有做成，还要饭吃！”被强迫做工的农民不仅一天到晚吃不上饭，赚不上工资，甚至还有许多人遭受了他的毒打。
            农奴式与奴隶式的压榨
    新疆各族劳动人民，不仅在经济上受着封建地主阶级严重的租额剥削与无偿劳动的超经济剥削，而且在政治上亦受着百般的侮辱和虐待，甚至有些地方的地主至今仍采取古代奴隶制与中世纪农奴制的剥削手段，压榨着无数劳动人民，使他们终年劳动不得温饱，过着牛马不如的生活，甚至往往连生命也毫无保障。如南疆于阗县去秋在征粮时发现一个村子有近似奴隶社会的庄园。该村七十二户人家中，除了大地主安的尔达外，其余七十一户均过着奴隶式的生活。安的尔达占有着全村所有的土地、房屋、牲畜、农具、水磨、油房等等一切，并把全村的农民视作他的私有财产。这些奴隶们既毫无所有，同时又因生活所迫，欠下了他的债；他们辛勤劳动一年，算下账来，还不够付安的尔达的利息。安的尔达以这个高利贷的剥削，像一条铁绳一样，紧紧地束缚住全村所有的农民，使他们毫无行动的自由，永远受着他残酷的剥削。有的农民因不堪忍受这种剥削而逃跑后，被安的尔达抓回去进行非刑拷打，有的因此而丧失了生命。鄯善县大恶霸马廷骧结婚时，买了一个农民麦斯木侍奉他的妻子，将麦的睾丸割去，使他失去生殖能力。麦斯木已过了四十年的奴隶生活。且末县恶霸地主买买提尔里统治着一百多个奴隶。这些奴隶不但经常遭受着毒打，失去了人的权利，而且经常遭受着残无人道的侮辱。奴隶们的姑娘经常遭受买买提尔里的随便奸污。奴隶们结婚时，买买提尔里有“初夜权”。
    新疆各族劳动人民中的妇女所遭受的灾难是更为凄惨的，她们不仅受着封建的压迫，而且遭受着多妻、早婚等残无人道的野蛮的摧残与凌辱。许多地方的恶霸对农民妇女的奸污是十分骇人听闻的。如墨玉县大恶霸伊蒙别克在今年以前的五十四岁中，前后奸污了一百一十六个小姑娘。他的雇工的老婆，不经他允许不能回家睡觉。有天晚上回家睡了，第二天被伊蒙别克打了个死去活来，最后用火把她的头发烧光。伊犁大恶霸艾尼先后奸污妇女七百余人，在他的兽性般的强奸下而死去的幼女即达十六人之多。艾尼至今仍霸占着七十多个女人。
            各族人民深信：在共产党领导下一定能消灭封建！
    新疆解放以后，各族人民的共同敌人——压在中国人民头上的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三位一体的以蒋介石匪帮为其最后代表的国民党反动统治被打倒了，而常常和帝国主义、官僚资本主义勾结在一起压迫人民的农村封建势力还没有消灭，他们依然对广大农民实行着非法残酷的压迫剥削。新疆解放以来，新疆人民政府、人民军队和各族人民在共产党的正确政策指导下，团结一致，进行了剿匪、生产、合理负担、抗美援朝、减租试办等许多工作。各族人民的政治觉悟和阶级觉悟有了相当的提高，他们从一年多的许多具体事例中，认识到只有共产党和人民政府才能帮助他们翻身。他们为求得自己真正的彻底解放，迫切要求组织起来打倒地主恶霸，进行减租反恶霸的斗争，从封建阶级的压榨下解放出来。觉悟了的新疆各族人民，对于减租反恶霸的斗争情绪是非常高涨的，如南疆和阗县第一乡试办减租时，第二乡的农民就自动组织起来向地主进行减租。在经过减租试办的地区，农民要求早日实行土地改革。当省人民代表会议开幕时，各地农民、妇女纷纷集会，控诉地主恶霸的罪行，并写信给省人民代表会议，要求制定减租办法。由于社会秩序已经安定，群众觉悟已相当提高，许多地方农民协会的组织已经建立，各地也已涌现与培养出一批本地的民族干部，外来干部对当地情况也有了一般的了解并与当地群众建立了一定的联系，这就具备了在广大农村进行社会改革的条件。所以，当群众要求进行减租反恶霸的翻身斗争时，中共中央新疆分局和新疆省人民政府就接受了广大农民这一迫切的要求，并经过省人民代表会议讨论通过，确定今冬明春在九个分区近四百万人口的农业区发动群众进行减租反恶霸的斗争。这一适时的决议，获得全新疆各族农民的热烈拥护。省人民代表会议上由各地来的农民代表们一致地说：“在共产党的领导下，我们各族农民都有信心有步骤地彻底消灭封建！”
    新疆的党与人民政府，为了领导人民有步骤的消灭封建、解放农村生产力，帮助各族农民翻身，正在以专区、县为单位训练大量的民族干部，并由驻新疆的人民解放军与省级党政机关抽调一万名干部，加以短期训练，使他们熟悉有关的各种政策与策略，学会划分阶级与发动群众组织群众的方法，吸取去秋试办减租的典型经验，然后派赴各地参加与指导这一运动。同时各地各民族中的广大人民群众，由于阶级觉悟空前提高，亦更加亲密地团结起来，自动协助政府检举反革命分子，迎接新疆历史上规模空前的农民翻身运动。
    〔注一〕秤子——维吾尔语称“卡拉子”，这是新疆民间习用的一种计算重量的单位。各地所表示的重量亦有不同，喀什、阿克苏一般称“一卡拉子”等于十六老斤，莎车区“一卡拉子”则等于十二老斤。
    〔注二〕吾受尔粮——这在过去是农民对于宗教的一种负担，收一石粮食要交一斗“吾受尔粮”，后改交维吾尔或哈萨克文化会举办的教育机关，但大部被少数人贪污。新疆解放后，各地各族的文化会由新疆人民民主同盟接收。
