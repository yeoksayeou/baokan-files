Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 10th. Preferential treatment work in Jiangxi, Hubei, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places has made significant achievements.

　　This year, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government allocated more than 10.02 million catties of grain and 613.2 million yuan to help more than 82,200 impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen solve their living difficulties. This spring, farmers in various places voluntarily organized substitute farming teams to help local families of martyrs and servicemen who lacked labor to cultivate their land. For example, Yiyang County organized 833 substitute farming teams to provide fixed substitute farming for 1,834 households of families of martyrs and servicemen. Farmers also included preferential treatment for families of martyrs and servicemen in their patriotic covenants, regarding it as a concrete patriotic action. Therefore, the cultivated land of substitute farmers reached or exceeded the cultivation level of ordinary farmers. For example, farmers in Lantian Township, Fuliang County, weeded the early rice fields of families of martyrs and servicemen four times and applied fertilizer four times. Chen Shaogui in Baidun Village, the same township, weeded his own early rice fields only four times, but he weeded the early rice fields of the family of the serviceman he was substitute farming for five times. The people's governments of various cities in the province have earnestly helped families of martyrs and servicemen participate in various jobs or production. In the past two years, the people's governments of Nanchang and Jiujiang alone have introduced 764 families of martyrs and servicemen to work in government agencies and various enterprises. The Nanchang Municipal People's Government also specially opened a linen weaving factory and a farm for families of martyrs and servicemen, enabling 397 families of martyrs and servicemen to participate in production. The children of impoverished families of martyrs and servicemen have also had the opportunity to attend school. In addition to the free or reduced tuition fees for them to attend various public primary and secondary schools, the province has also opened five schools for children of families of martyrs and servicemen, providing free admission to children of families of martyrs and servicemen. A total of more than 2,100 children of families of martyrs and servicemen enrolled in the first semester of this year. The Provincial People's Government also plans to open a cultural supplementary school in Nanchang after autumn, equivalent to the level of a secondary school. Respect for families of martyrs and servicemen has become a social norm. Many families of martyrs and servicemen have been elected as representatives to attend people's representative conferences at all levels. Liu Laidi, a model family member of a serviceman in Shanggang Village, Wuyang Township, Ruijin County, has been elected as a representative to the Provincial People's Representative Conference. During the New Year and other festivals, the masses in various places also voluntarily sent gifts to comfort the local families of martyrs and servicemen. In Ruijin County, the doors of more than 1,400 families of martyrs and servicemen are hung with honorary plaques presented by the county people's government.

　　In Hubei Province, during the land reform, farmers automatically distributed better and more land and farm tools to the families of martyrs, servicemen, and staff. Most families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers in Xishui County, in addition to being allocated land closer to their homes, also received enough grain to survive the spring famine. The people's governments in various places paid special attention to the schooling of children from impoverished families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers. In Tonghaikou District, Mianyang County, 50% of the children from families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers have entered schools. They are exempt from tuition fees, and the people's government also helps them with some book fees. Among the students enjoying scholarships in the province's middle schools, the children from families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers account for 10% to 20%. The Education Section of the Jingzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office also paid special attention to organizing out-of-school children of families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers to participate in people's schools. Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea and land reform movements, the broad masses of people have been more concerned about families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers. In many areas, farmers have automatically formulated measures to give preferential treatment to families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers, and included these measures in patriotic covenants.

　　In the past two years, Wuhan City has introduced more than 1,000 impoverished families of martyrs and servicemen to work in various factories, and issued more than 350 million yuan in preferential treatment funds, ensuring the livelihoods of more than 8,000 families of martyrs and servicemen who lacked labor and faced difficulties in life. The city's Bureau of Culture and Education has also stipulated measures to give preferential treatment to children of families of martyrs and servicemen entering schools, enabling more than 2,000 children of families of martyrs and servicemen to attend school free of charge.

　　In the past six months, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government has issued a total of more than 60,000 catties of preferential treatment and subsidy grain to 263 impoverished families of martyrs and servicemen, and has successively established clothing processing factories, laundry factories, sewing factories, etc., to organize impoverished families of martyrs and servicemen to produce in various factories.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th. Achievements have been made in the preferential treatment work in Gansu and northern Shaanxi. In northern Shaanxi, the number of families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers accounts for 15% of the total population. After northern Shaanxi was severely damaged by the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan bandit troops in 1947, their living standards were once lower than those of local middle peasants. In the past two years, thanks to the care and assistance of people's governments at all levels, the Central People's Government has successively allocated 115,000 shi of preferential grain this winter and spring, and mass preferential treatment movements have been launched in various places. Their living standards have now generally reached the level of local middle peasants.

　　In order to thoroughly solve the difficulties of families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers in northern Shaanxi in terms of production and life, the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government have dispatched 166 cadres in batches to assist various places in carrying out preferential treatment work. The working group dispatched last October conducted in-depth inspections of the past preferential treatment work by visiting households and holding seminars. Various places have also preliminarily corrected the tendencies of some cadres neglecting to organize families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers to build their homes and not seriously implementing the contract farming system, and strengthened the leadership of township preferential treatment committees and village preferential treatment groups through county and township people's representative conferences, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, activist conferences, and township and village cadre conferences. This March, various places conducted evaluations of the living conditions and labor force of families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers based on a general survey, reducing the burden on the masses and providing more care for the families that should be given preferential treatment, thus promoting a new mass upsurge of preferential treatment.

　　In the past half year, with the help of the government's allocation of grain to purchase livestock and farm tools, subsidies for insufficient living expenses, and various assistance from the masses, the difficulties of families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers in various parts of northern Shaanxi in terms of life and production have been substantially resolved, so their enthusiasm for production has been particularly high this year. They have generally formulated agricultural and sideline production plans in the spring plowing, expressing their intention to strive to be model families of servicemen and labor models. Many families of servicemen also wrote letters to their children or husbands, telling them about the government and the masses helping them solve difficulties and build their homes, and encouraging them to work actively in their posts.

　　In Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, before July this year, more than 470 families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen had been introduced by the people's government to factories to engage in production or participate in various construction projects. In addition, the government has also allocated 100 public houses for families of martyrs and servicemen who lack housing to live in. The people's governments in various parts of the province regularly distribute relief grain and other items to families of martyrs and servicemen who have no labor force or are impoverished. In Pingliang, Xiahe and other 42 counties alone, more than 294.2 million yuan in subsidies, more than 200 shi of grain, more than 6,600 chickens and sheep, more than 92,000 catties of oil, salt and vegetables, more than 33,000 eggs, and more than 20,000 other items were allocated during the "Support the Army Month" this year. In areas where land reform and rent reduction are implemented, families of martyrs and servicemen generally received preferential treatment when distributing the fruits of struggle. Various places have universally implemented the methods of helping to cultivate, substitute cultivation, and contract cultivation for families of martyrs and servicemen who lack labor or have no labor force, and at the same time stipulated that the output of substitute cultivation shall not be lower than the harvest of ordinary farmers.

　　中南西北部分地区优抚工作获成绩
    尊敬烈军属成为社会风气
    各地组织代耕介绍职业烈军属生活困难初步解决
    【新华社汉口十日电】江西、湖北、武汉、广州等地优抚工作，已有显著成绩。
    江西省人民政府今年曾拨出一千零二十余万斤粮食和六亿一千三百二十余万元人民币，帮助八万二千二百余户贫苦革命烈士家属、军人家属解决了生活上的困难。今年春天，各地农民都自愿组织代耕小组，帮助当地缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属耕种。如弋阳县就组织了八百三十三个代耕小组，固定代耕一千八百三十四户烈属、军属的土地。农民们并将优待烈属、军属工作列入爱国公约，当作爱国的具体行动之一，因此代耕的农田都能达到或超过一般农户的耕作水平。如浮梁县蓝田乡的农民，今年都把烈属、军属的早禾田耘了四遍，下四次肥。该乡柏墩村陈绍贵自己的早禾田只耘了四遍，他代耕的军属的早禾田却耘了五次。该省各城市的人民政府都认真帮助烈属、军属，参加各种工作或生产。仅南昌、九江两市人民政府在过去两年中就介绍了烈属、军属七百六十四人到政府机关和各企业部门工作。南昌市人民政府还专门开办了一个烈属、军属麻织工厂和一个农场，使三百九十七位烈属、军属参加了生产。贫苦烈属、军属的子女也已经得到入学的机会。该省除各公立中、小学已规定免费或减费招收他们上学外，并开办了五个烈属、军属子弟学校，免费招收烈属、军属子女入学。今年上学期入学的烈属、军属子女共有二千一百余名。省人民政府还准备秋后在南昌开办一所相当于中等学校水平的文化补习学校。尊敬烈属、军属已成为社会风气。各地均有不少烈属、军属被选为代表出席各级人民代表会议。瑞金县武阳乡上岗村模范军属刘来娣已被选为省各界人民代表会议代表。每逢过年过节，各地群众还纷纷自动送礼品慰问当地烈属、军属。瑞金县有一千四百余户烈属、军属的住屋大门上都挂了由该县人民政府赠送的光荣匾。
    湖北省各地农民在土地改革中，自动分给烈属、军属和工作人员家属较好较多的土地和农具。浠水县大部烈属、军属、工属除分到较近的土地外，并分到了足够度过春荒的粮食。各地人民政府对贫苦烈属、军属、工属子弟入学问题特别注意。沔阳县通海口区有百分之五十的烈属、军属、工属子弟都进了学校。他们免缴学费，人民政府并帮助他们一部分书籍费。全省中学享受助学金的学生中，烈属、军属、工属的子弟占百分之十至二十。荆州专署教育科并特别注意组织失学的烈属、军属、工属子弟参加民校。抗美援朝、土地改革运动开展以来，广大人民更加关心烈属、军属、工属。很多地区的农民自动订出优待烈属、军属、工属的办法，并把这个办法列入爱国公约。
    武汉市两年来共介绍了一千多位贫苦的烈属、军属到各种工厂去工作，并发出优抚金三亿五千多万元，使八千余位缺乏劳动力而生活困难的烈属、军属在生活上得到保障。该市文教局并规定了优待烈属、军属子弟入学的办法，使二千多名烈属、军属子弟得以免费入学。
    广州市人民政府在今年半年来发给二百六十三户贫苦烈属、军属的优抚补助粮共六万余斤，并已先后成立了被服加工工厂、洗衣工厂、缝衣工厂等，组织贫苦烈属、军属到各工厂去生产。
    【新华社十一日讯】甘肃与陕北地区的优抚工作，已做出成绩。陕北地区烈属、军属、工属人数占总人口的百分之十五。一九四七年陕北遭蒋胡匪军严重破坏后，他们的生活曾一度低于当地中农生活水平。近二年来，由于各级人民政府的关怀与帮助，去冬今春中央人民政府先后拨给十一万五千石优待粮，各地又开展了群众性的优抚运动，他们的生活现在已普遍达到当地中农的水平。
    为彻底解决陕北烈属、军属、工属在生产和生活方面的困难，西北军政委员会和陕西省人民政府曾分批派出一百六十六名干部协助各地进行优抚工作。去年十月派出的工作组，曾以逐户访问，召开座谈会等方式，深入检查了过去优抚工作的情况。各地并通过县、乡人民代表会议，共产党员、青年团员、积极分子会议，乡、村干部会议，初步纠正了某些干部中忽视组织烈属、军属、工属生产建家和不认真执行包耕制度等偏向，加强了对乡优抚委员会和村优待小组的领导。今年三月，各地在普查的基础上对烈属、军属、工属的生活与劳动力进行了评比，减少了群众的负担，使应该受到优待的家属得到了更多的照顾，因此促成了新的群众性的优抚热潮。
    近半年来，陕北各地烈属、军属、工属，在政府拨粮帮助购买牲畜、农具，补助生活不足和群众的各种帮助下，生活和生产方面的困难都得到相当解决，因而今年他们的生产热情特别高涨。他们在春耕中普遍订立了农、副业生产计划，表示要争取当军属模范和劳动模范。许多军属并将政府和群众帮助他们解决困难建立家务的情形，写信告诉给自己的子女或丈夫、并鼓励他们在工作岗位上积极工作。
    甘肃省兰州市在今年七月份以前，即有四百七十多位革命烈士家属与革命军人家属经人民政府介绍，进入工厂从事生产，或参加各项建设工作。此外，政府还拨出一百间公共房屋，给缺乏房子的烈属、军属居住。该省各地人民政府对没有劳动力的和贫苦的烈属、军属，均按期发给救济粮和其他物品。仅平凉、夏河等四十二个县，在今年“拥军月”中就拨发补助费二亿九千四百多万元，粮食二百多石，鸡、羊六千六百多只，油盐与菜蔬九万二千多斤，鸡蛋三万三千多个，及其他物品二万余件。在实行土地改革和减租的地区，在分配斗争果实时，烈属、军属普遍受到优待。各地对缺少劳动力和没有劳动力的烈属、军属，普遍地实行了助耕、代耕和包耕的办法，同时规定代耕的产量不得低于一般农民的收获量。
