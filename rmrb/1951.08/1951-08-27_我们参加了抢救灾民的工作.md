We Participated in the Work of Rescuing Disaster Victims
People's Air Force Soldier Zhao Ruiqing

Our plane landed at Shenyang Airport on August 16th. Just as we were about to leave the airport, we received an order by telephone: to immediately carry out the task of rescuing disaster victims. At that time, although we had not yet eaten, in order to quickly save the lives of tens of thousands of disaster victims, we drove the plane to another airport to load emergency boats without eating. After loading the boats, it was 5:30 PM. At that time, on the way to fly over Kaiyuan, the clouds were very low, and it was still raining. Normally, we could not fly under such conditions. However, in order to save the lives of tens of thousands of compatriots, we resolutely took off. The plane passed through dense clouds, and the wind and rain beat against the glass windows. We nervously judged the flight route, and finally arrived in Kaiyuan at 6:50 PM that day.

In this way, we repeatedly transported boats, clothes, bread and other items from Shenyang and other places to the disaster victims, flying for several days in a row.

On the plane, we saw many compatriots forced by the vast flood to climb trees, squat on houses or mounds. At the same time, we also witnessed the People's Government mobilizing all its forces to rescue the disaster victims and minimize their suffering. In the Kaiyuan County People's Government, we saw rescue workers rushing from Harbin. They cooperated with local cadres to rescue the disaster victims selflessly, sleeping on the floor at night, sometimes without even taking time to eat. Although they were so arduous, they tried their best to take care of our food and accommodation. We carried out Chairman Mao's order to use the plane to rescue disaster victims. From this, we realized even more that the People's Air Force is not only defending the security of the motherland at all times, but also contributing more to the people as much as possible. Because of this, we were loved by local cadres and the masses. Thinking of this, we felt even more honored to be a soldier of the People's Air Force, and at the same time, we felt more responsible. We deeply realized that every second of our flight speed and the items we loaded were closely related to the lives of tens of thousands of people. Therefore, we braved the bad weather to transport materials back and forth. Over the disaster-stricken areas, we tried our best to find all means to fly low and accurately drop the supplies into the hands of the disaster victims. We finally completed this glorious task.

### 我们参加了抢救灾民的工作

　　我们参加了抢救灾民的工作
    人民空军战士  赵瑞清
    我们的飞机在八月十六日降落在沈阳飞机场。正当要离开机场的时候，我们从电话里得到命令：马上去执行抢救灾民的任务。当时，我们虽还未进餐，但为了使几万灾民的生命能够迅速脱险，我们顾不上吃饭就将飞机驾驶到另一机场去装救急船。装好船后，时间已到下午五时半。当时，飞向开原上空的路上，乌云很低，雨还在下，往常在这种情况下是不能飞行的。但是，为了抢救数万同胞的生命，我们毅然地起飞了。飞机穿过浓密的云雾，风雨击打着玻璃窗，我们紧张地判别飞行的路线，终于在当天下午六点五十分到了开原。
    就这样，我们一次又一次地把船只、衣服、面包等物品，由沈阳等地运给灾民，一连飞行了好几天。
    在飞机上，我们看见许多同胞被白茫茫的大水逼得爬在树上，蹲在房子上或土岗上。同时，我们也亲眼见到人民政府已经动员了一切力量来抢救灾民，尽量减少灾民的痛苦。在开原县人民政府里，我们看到由哈尔滨赶来的救灾人员，他们配合当地干部奋不顾身地抢救灾民，夜里就睡在地板上，有时连饭都顾不上吃。他们虽然那样艰苦，却尽量照顾我们的食宿。我们执行着毛主席的命令，把飞机用来抢救灾民，由此我们更认识到人民空军不仅是在时刻捍卫着祖国的安全，还要尽量为人民贡献出更多的力量。正因为这样，所以我们受到了当地干部和群众的爱戴。想到这里，我们就越发感到做一个人民空军战士的光荣，同时也更觉得责任的重大。我们深深体会到，我们每一秒钟的飞行速度和所装载的物品，都是和数万人民的生命密切联系着的。因此，我们冒着恶劣的天气往返运送物资。在受灾地区的上空，我们尽可能寻求一切办法低飞，把物资准确地投到灾民手里。我们终于完成了这一光荣的任务。
