Editor's Note: The Decision on Strengthening Leadership in Capital Construction, issued by the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government on July 18th of this year, summarizes the experience of the Northeast's industrial capital construction leadership work, thoroughly elucidates the significant meaning of industrial capital construction, and, based on the new situation of industrial recovery and development in the Northeast, timely proposes the policy of giving equal importance to production and capital construction. The decision states that to do a good job in capital construction, it is necessary to overcome two ideological tendencies: one is the conservative tendency of not creating conditions for larger-scale modernized capital construction with the most active spirit; the other is the adventurous tendency of blindly launching projects with a reckless attitude. Enterprise leading organs across the country should pay attention to preventing and overcoming these two tendencies. Earnestly studying and learning from the Northeast's experience will enable capital construction work in various regions to avoid many detours.

(I)
The state's capital construction in industry is not merely an economic and technical issue; more importantly, it directly embodies the state's industrial policy and the path of national industrialization. The state stipulates the direction, steps, speed, and scale of industrial development in its industrial capital construction plan, stipulates the proportion of the development of various industries, stipulates the future technological level of industry, stipulates how to utilize national resources, and other major issues related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, both the capital construction plan and the specific implementation of capital construction bear major political responsibility to the state. If, when establishing a new enterprise or restoring and transforming an old enterprise, the political and economic conditions of the region are not considered; the economic rationality is not considered; new technological achievements are not adopted; the maximum possible utilization of national resources is not considered; and the due quality is reduced due to carelessness in the process of capital construction, then not only will it affect current industrial production, but it will also harm the future of industry, placing national industry in an unreasonable state for a long time. Precisely because of this, the issue of capital construction in industry is no less important to the leading organs and leading cadres of enterprises than the issue of production in industry. At the same time, the scope involved in capital construction is broader than the current production issues, and the principal and technical issues that need to be considered and resolved are more complex. It determines the future and path of national economic development; therefore, a serious error in capital construction is often not only an economic waste but often forms a historical error of principle. Therefore, under the overall guidelines and policies of the Party and the state, correctly leading the conduct of capital construction is the most important task of enterprise leading organs and leading cadres in enterprises.

(II)
After the liberation of the Northeast, the first problem we needed to solve in industry was how to restore industrial production in the Northeast on the ruins destroyed by the Kuomintang; how to dispatch a large number of cadres to learn industrial production management at the highest speed; how to transform old enterprises into new people's enterprises; how to turn the working class from slaves of the enterprise into masters of the enterprise; how to transform the old blind pursuit of private profit into planned production to increase the wealth of the national society. In the three years up to now, under the correct leadership of the CCP Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and the CCP Northeast Bureau, we have gradually solved the above-mentioned problems placed before us. During the entire period from the time of taking over industrial production to the present, due to the above reasons and because the capital construction of this period was mostly relatively simple restoration or simple improvement, the leading cadres in the enterprise and the various institutions in the enterprise had to put their main energy into industrial production, had to put the focus of leadership on the current production issues, and the various institutions in the enterprise had to spend most of their time on resolving some urgent matters related to production issues. This was completely necessary and completely correct in the initial period when we took over the enterprises.

However, the situation has now changed significantly. This change is manifested in the Northeast's industry moving from a relatively simple recovery stage to the preparation stage for larger-scale capital construction. If in the past it was a relatively simple restoration or a relatively simple transformation, now a larger-scale restoration and transformation has begun, and preparations have begun for building more new enterprises. Under this circumstance, our design and capital construction strength is even more incompatible with the current tasks and requirements, and lags far behind the objective needs. At the same time, a preliminary necessary system has been established in enterprise production. The change in this situation makes it not only necessary but also possible for us to make timely adjustments to the proportion of "production" and "capital construction" that our enterprise leading organs and leading cadres lead, and to place capital construction and production in equally important positions. We must change the view of attaching importance to production and not to capital construction in leadership, and we must change the view of placing capital construction in a secondary position. Failing to understand and grasp this change in the situation, and taking any hesitant or delaying attitude towards this issue, will cause the most serious errors.

(III)
In the past, leadership organs at all levels have done a lot of work for the progress of capital construction and have achieved many remarkable results, which have enabled rapid growth in industrial production. However, it must be pointed out that in the past, many enterprises had two harmful tendencies in the leadership of capital construction: that is, on the one hand, in the preparation of conditions for long-term capital construction, there was a lack of the most active spirit to first prepare and expand resources, to create material and technical prerequisites with the most active spirit, to cultivate a reserve labor force with the most active spirit, to discover and adopt the most advanced technological level with the most active spirit, to solve the main links and weak links in the construction between enterprises with the most active spirit, to study and explore new potential forces in capital construction with the most active spirit, and to cultivate and expand design capabilities with the most active spirit. That is to say, there was a lack of the most active spirit to create conditions, create a material foundation, and carry out the most necessary preparatory work for larger-scale, higher-speed modernized capital construction. This makes our future large-scale industrial construction lack sufficient objective conditions, which actually delays the speed of future industrial development, and actually forms a conservative tendency towards industrial construction plans. But on the other hand, when many of our enterprises formulated concrete engineering plans for capital construction, they often adopted a reckless attitude, formulating engineering construction plans without necessary procedures such as investigation, research, and design, thus making the concrete engineering plans have an adventurous tendency. Without overcoming these two tendencies in thought and practical measures, capital construction cannot be carried out correctly.

(IV)
In order to ensure that capital construction is carried out on the correct path, and in order to strengthen the leadership of capital construction in a timely manner, the following measures must be taken:

(1) Conduct education on capital construction among cadres. Cadres in enterprises should not only learn how to lead production, but also must learn how to formulate capital construction plans, how to carry out the necessary preparatory work for capital construction, how to lead the specific construction of capital construction, and how to fight against all erroneous tendencies in the ideological field. This education, this learning, must be as widespread and as persistent as the past and present learning of production management. All cadres and workers should be made to understand ideologically the serious political responsibility that capital construction bears to the country, and understand the historical task that capital construction bears. Only by ideologically recognizing the nature and position of future capital construction will it be possible to truly strengthen the leadership of capital construction by leadership organs at all levels.

(2) In the past, leading organs and departments at all levels mostly placed emphasis on production in terms of the use of cadres, time, institutions, and energy. The number of cadres managing production far exceeded the number of capital construction departments, the strength of production institutions far exceeded the strength of capital construction departments, and the time and energy that cadres spent on production far exceeded the time and energy spent on capital construction. Most cadres were willing to do production management work, but unwilling to work in capital construction departments. Problems in production were easily resolved in a timely manner, but problems in capital construction were often not resolved in a timely manner. Leading cadres and departments at all levels have begun to pay great attention to whether production plans are completed, and regularly check them; but they often do not check or do not pay enough attention to whether capital construction plans are completed in a timely manner. This situation must be changed. To this end, the Industrial Department specifically instructs each Bureau Director and Company Manager to take practical measures to strengthen capital construction: (1) The various departments of the Industrial Department, Bureaus, and Companies should place the work of capital construction in an equally important position as production, and strengthen the practical education of various departments serving capital construction. (2) Transfer a batch of capable cadres and technicians from production to supplement the capital construction departments, design departments, and engineering companies. (3) The cadres and graduates of universities and senior vocational schools that are planned to be assigned to various departments and enterprises this year should in principle be used to supplement the shortage of cadres and technicians in capital construction departments, design departments, and engineering companies; those who must be assigned to production departments due to their major should transfer appropriate personnel from production departments to supplement the relevant capital construction departments. (4) The time that each Bureau of Administration spends researching and discussing the capital construction of their unit should not be less than the time spent researching and discussing production issues.

(3) Create and cultivate a reserve force for capital construction with the greatest enthusiasm and creativity, and carry out the preparatory work for the long-term plan of capital construction with the greatest enthusiasm. This includes: (1) Investigation of geological resources; (2) Expansion and strengthening of scientific research institutions; (3) Expansion and strengthening of engineering colleges, senior vocational schools, and training courses run by capital construction offices, design companies, and engineering companies; (4) Cultivation of various types of skilled workers to the greatest extent possible; (5) Maximum possible expansion of design institutions and design technicians, and adopting various effective measures to strengthen the study of design work; (6) According to the scale of construction of each enterprise, expand and cultivate the ability of engineering companies in civil construction and mechanical and electrical installation; (7) Cultivation of translation talents. All the above measures to increase the speed and quality of future capital construction must be regarded as the top priority of leadership organs at all levels. In addition to the responsibility of the main leading cadres at all levels, it is also necessary to designate specialized institutions to be responsible for planning and checking the degree of implementation of the above tasks according to the nature of the work. The funds and investments required for all the above measures should be included in the capital construction plan. As long as we can do this work well, we will prepare a good material foundation for future industrial construction. As long as we do this work well, we will effectively overcome the conservative tendencies that may occur in industrial construction.

(4) In the entire capital construction work, we must oppose the average use of forces. Design, use of funds, preparation and supply of construction materials, construction inspection, etc., should all implement this spirit. In the annual plan of capital construction, as well as in concrete construction, we should seize the main engineering projects and strive with all our strength to complete the main engineering projects. We must overcome the view of using forces equally regardless of major and minor, and timely summarize the experience in capital construction, in order to educate all cadres and workers and increase the ability of capital construction.

(5) All cadres in capital construction departments must deeply understand that capital construction is also a kind of industrial production. Therefore, they should carefully study and learn from the experience of managing production, and apply the basic principles and working methods of how to carry out economic accounting, how to strengthen technical management, cost management, and financial management in production management to capital construction work, in order to strengthen the leadership of capital construction.

(6) All cadres in enterprises, especially cadres in capital construction departments and design departments, must study and implement the following documents and regulations: Summary of Capital Construction in 1950, Provisional Contracting Regulations for Capital Construction Projects, Provisional Management Regulations for the Design of Capital Construction Projects, Several Decisions on Design Work in Capital Construction. As long as we can carry out the specific work of capital construction according to the experience summarized in the above documents, and continue to summarize experience in actual work, we will be able to overcome adventurous tendencies in capital construction projects.

(V)
Each Bureau Director and Company Manager must, within one month after the issuance of this instruction, report to the Industrial Department the specific steps, measures, and specific plans you will take to strengthen capital construction, and the personnel departments at all levels should report to the Personnel Division of the Industrial Department the cadre allocation plan for strengthening capital construction.

　　东北人民政府工业部
    关于加强基本建设领导的决定
    编者按：东北人民政府工业部，在今年七月十八日发布的关于加强基本建设领导的决定，总结了东北工业基本建设领导工作的经验，透彻地阐明了工业基本建设的重大意义，并根据东北工业恢复和发展的新情况，适时地提出了生产与基本建设并重的方针。决定说明了要做好基本建设工作，必须克服两种思想倾向：一种是不以最积极的精神去为更大规模地进行现代化的基本建设创造条件的保守倾向；一种是采取轻率态度盲目举办工程的冒险倾向。这两种倾向，全国各地企业领导机关都应当注意防止和克服。认真研究、学习东北的经验，将会使各地的基本建设工作少走许多弯路。
        （一）
    国家在工业方面的基本建设，不单是经济与技术问题，更重要的意义是它直接体现着国家在工业方面的政策和国家工业化的道路。国家从工业的基本建设计划中规定着工业发展的方针、步骤、速度与规模，规定着各种工业发展的比重，规定着将来工业的技术水平，规定着国家资源的如何运用等等关系于国计民生的重大问题。因此，基本建设计划与基本建设的具体实施，都对国家负有重大的政治责任。如果建立一个新的企业或恢复改造一个旧有企业时，在地区上不考虑政治条件与经济条件；不考虑经济上的合理性；不采取新的技术成就；不考虑到最大可能地运用国家资源；以及在基本建设的过程中由于马虎从事而降低了应有的质量等等；则不仅影响着现实的工业生产，而且也危害着工业的将来，使国家工业在长时期内处于不合理的状态。正因为如此，工业中的基本建设问题，对于企业的领导机关与领导干部，其重要性绝不小于工业中的生产问题。同时，基本建设所涉及的范围比现实的生产问题更加广阔，需要考虑解决的原则问题和技术问题更加错综复杂，它决定着国家经济发展的前途和道路，因此，基本建设中的一个严重错误常常不仅是一个经济上的浪费，而往往形成历史性的原则错误。因此，在党与国家总的方针政策下，正确地领导基本建设的进行，是企业领导机关与企业中的领导干部头等重要的任务。
  （二）
    东北解放后，我们在工业中首先需要解决的问题，是如何在国民党破坏过的废墟上，把东北工业的生产恢复起来；是如何派遣大批干部，以最高的速度学习工业中的生产管理；是如何把旧的企业转变为人民的新企业；是如何使工人阶级从企业的奴隶变为企业的主人；是如何把旧的追求私人利润的盲目生产变为增加国家社会财富的计划生产。到现在为止三年的过程中，我们在中共中央、中央人民政府及中共中央东北局的正确领导下，是逐步地解决着以上摆在面前的一些问题。在接管工业生产当时以至今天以前的整个时期中，由于以上原因以及由于这一时期的基本建设还大都属于比较简单的恢复或简单的改进，因而企业中的领导干部以及企业中的各种机构，不能不把主要的精力放在工业生产方面，不能不把领导的重点放在现实的生产问题上，企业中的各种机构不能不把大部分时间放在解决生产问题的一些迫切事务上。这在我们接管企业开始的一个时期里，是完全必要与完全正确的。
    但是现在情况已显著地有了变化，这种变化表现在东北工业已由比较简单的恢复阶段走向更大规模基本建设的准备阶段。如果过去还是比较简单的恢复或比较简单的改造，则现在已经开始了规模较大的恢复改造，开始了建设更多新企业的准备工作。在这种情况下，我们的设计和基本建设的力量，与当前的任务和要求更加不相适应，而远远落后于客观的需要。同时，企业的生产中也已建立了初步的必要制度。这种情况的变化，使我们不仅有必要而且有可能把我们企业领导机关与领导干部对于领导“生产”与“基本建设”的比重加以及时的调整，把基本建设和生产放在同等重要的地位。必须改变领导上重视生产不重视基本建设的观点，必须改变把基本建设放在次要地位的观点。不了解与掌握这种情况的变化，对于这一问题采取任何犹豫或拖延的态度，都将造成最严重的错误。
  （三）
    过去各级企业领导机构对于基本建设的进行都作了不少工作，而且取得了许多显著成绩，这种成绩使工业生产迅速地增长。但是必须指出，过去许多企业在基本建设的领导上，存在着两种有害的倾向：即一方面对准备长期基本建设的条件上，缺乏以最积极的精神去首先准备与扩大资源，以最积极的精神创造物质前提与技术前提，以最积极的精神培养劳动后备力量，以最积极的精神去发现与采取最先进的技术水平，以最积极的精神去解决企业中与企业之间建设中的主要环节及脆弱环节，以最积极的精神去钻研与发掘基本建设中新的潜在力量，以最积极的精神培养与扩大设计能力，也就是说，缺乏以最积极的精神去为更大规模、更高速度进行现代化基本建设创造条件、创造物质基础、进行最必要的准备工作。这样就使我们将来较大规模的工业建设缺乏充足的客观条件，这样就实际上延缓了将来工业发展的速度，实际上形成了对工业建设计划的保守倾向。但是另一方面，我们许多企业在编制基本建设的具体工程计划时，则又往往采取轻率的态度，不经调查、研究、设计等等必要的程序而制定工程施工计划，这样就使具体的工程计划带有冒险的倾向。不在思想上与实际措施中克服这两种倾向，基本建设即不可能正确地进行。
  （四）
    为了保证基本建设在正确的道路上进行，为了及时地加强基本建设的领导，必须采取以下的措施：
    （一）在干部中进行基本建设的教育。企业中的干部不仅应该学会如何领导生产，而且必须学会如何制定基本建设计划，如何进行基本建设的必要准备工作，如何领导基本建设的具体施工，以及如何在思想领域内向一切错误的倾向做斗争。这种教育、这种学习，必须像过去与现在学习生产管理一样地普及，一样地坚持。应该使所有干部以及职工在思想上了解基本建设对国家所负的严重的政治责任，了解基本建设所负的历史性的任务。只有在思想上认识了今后基本建设的性质和地位，才有可能真正加强各级领导机关对于基本建设的领导力量。
    （二）过去各级领导机关以及各个部门，在干部、时间、机构、精力的使用上大都偏重于生产方面。管理生产的干部大大地超过基本建设部门，生产机构的力量远超过基本建设部门的力量，干部花费于生产方面的时间与精力，远超过花费于基本建设方面的时间与精力。多数干部愿意做生产管理工作，而不愿意到基本建设部门工作。生产中的问题易于及时解决，基本建设中的问题往往得不到及时解决。各级领导干部与各个部门对于生产计划的是否完成，已经开始了大的注意，并经常地加以检查；但对于基本建设计划的是否完成则常常不加及时检查，或不够重视。这一情况必须加以转变。为此，工业部特责成各管理局长、公司经理采取实际加强基本建设的办法：（１）工业部、局、公司各部门应把基本建设方面的工作放在与生产同等重要的地位，加强各部门为基本建设服务的实际教育。（２）从生产中抽调一批得力干部及技术人员补充到基本建设部门、设计部门及工程公司。（３）今年预备分配给各部门各企业的干部及大学、高级职业学校毕业学生，原则上均应补充基本建设部门、设计部门及工程公司干部与技术人员之不足；由于学习的业务关系必须分配到生产部门者，则应从生产部门中调剂出适当的人力补入有关基本建设的部门。（４）各管理局研究讨论本单位基本建设的时间，应不少于研究讨论生产问题的时间。
    （三）以最大的积极性创造性与培养基本建设的后备力量，以最大的积极性进行基本建设长期计划的准备工作。这里包括：（１）地质资源的调查；（２）科学研究机关的扩大加强；（３）工学院、高级职业学校以及基本建设处、设计公司、工程公司所办训练班的扩大与加强；（４）各类技术工人最大可能的培养；（５）设计机构与设计技术人员最大可能的扩充，及采取各种有效办法加强设计工作的学习；（６）根据各企业建设的规模，扩大与培养工程公司的土木建筑和机电安装的能力；（７）翻译人材的培养。所有以上为着增加将来基本建设速度与基本建设质量的措施，必须作为各级领导机关头等重要的工作。除由各级主要领导干部负责外，同时需要按工作的性质，把以上各项工作指定专门机构负责计划及检查其执行程度。所有以上措施所需要的经费与投资应列入基本建设计划。只要能够把这些工作做好，我们就为将来的工业建设准备了良好的物质基础。只要把这些工作做好，我们就会有效地克服工业建设中可能发生的保守倾向。
    （四）在整个基本建设工作中，必须反对平均使用力量。设计、资金使用、建设材料的准备与供应、施工检查等等，都应贯彻这种精神。在基本建设的年度计划中，以及具体施工中，应抓紧主要工程项目，用全力为完成主要工程项目而奋斗。必须克服不分主要次要平均使用力量的观点，并及时地总结基本建设中的经验，以此教育全体干部及职工，增长基本建设的能力。
    （五）所有基本建设部门的干部，必须深刻地了解，基本建设也是一种工业生产，因此应该很好地研究和学习管理生产的经验，把管理生产中如何进行经济核算，如何加强技术管理、成本管理、财务管理等基本的原则和工作方法，运用到基本建设工作中来，以加强对基本建设的领导。
    （六）所有企业中的干部，特别是基本建设部门与设计部门的干部，必须学习和贯彻执行以下几个文件与条例：一九五○年基本建设总结，基本建设工程暂行包工条例，基本建设工程设计暂行管理条例，关于基本建设中设计工作的几项决定。只要我们能够按照以上文件中所总结出的经验，去进行基本建设的具体工作，并继续在实际工作中总结经验，我们就有可能在基本建设工程中克服冒险倾向。
  （五）
    各管理局长、公司经理必须于这项指示发出之后的一个月内，将你们具体实行加强基本建设的步骤、措施及具体计划报告工业部，各级人事部门应将加强基本建设的干部配备计划报告工业部人事处。
