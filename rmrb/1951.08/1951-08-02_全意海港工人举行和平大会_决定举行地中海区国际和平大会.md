Xinhua News Agency, Rome, August 1st: According to TASS, Italian dockworkers held a peace conference in Genoa on July 28th and 29th. 132 representatives of dockworkers from all over Italy participated in the conference. The conference decided to hold a Mediterranean region international peace conference and issued a letter to the people of all Italian ports.

　　Sevasco, a member of the conference preparatory committee, in his report, vehemently denounced the U.S. imperialists for forcibly turning Naples, Livorno, Ancona, and many other ports into bases for launching aggressive wars. He pointed out that the struggle for the freedom and improvement of the economic conditions of the working people is part of the overall struggle for peace.

　　Corona, chairman of the dockworkers' union in Livorno, a port occupied by the U.S. military, announced that 180,000 people in Livorno had signed the Peace Pact Declaration. This is their answer to U.S. military aggression. Other representatives who spoke at the meeting unanimously pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the peace movement and the Peace Pact signature campaign.

　　The conference finally passed a resolution to change the conference presidium into the "Preparatory Committee for the Mediterranean Dockworkers' Peace Committee," responsible for uniting the peace forces of all ports in Italy and preparing for the Mediterranean region international peace conference. The conference also issued a letter to the people of all ports in Italy, calling on them to fight to defend peace and to strive for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers.

    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利全国海港工人于七月二十八、二十九两日在热那亚举行和平大会。参加大会的有全意各海港工人代表一百三十二人。大会决定要举行地中海区国际和平大会，并发表了告意大利各海港人民书。
    大会筹备委员会委员塞瓦斯科在报告中痛斥美帝国主义强行把那不勒斯、里窝那、安科纳及其他许多海港变成发动侵略战争的基地。他指出：争取劳动人民的自由和改善劳动人民经济条件的斗争，是争取和平的总斗争的一部分。
    在美军占领下的里窝那港的码头工人工会主席柯罗纳宣布：里窝那已经有十八万人在和平公约宣言上签了名。这就是他们对美国军事侵略的回答。在会上发言的其他代表都一致指出：必须加强和平运动与和平公约签名运动。
    大会最后通过决议，把大会主席团改成“地中海海港工人和平委员会筹备委员会”，负责团结全意大利各港口的和平力量，并筹备地中海区国际和平大会。大会并发表告意大利各港口人民书，号召他们为保卫和平、为争取五大国缔结和平公约而斗争。
