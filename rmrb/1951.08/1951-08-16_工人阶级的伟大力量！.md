The Great Power of the Working Class!
    Workers at Fengtai Locomotive Depot Strive to Reduce Costs, Saving the Nation Over 1 Billion Yuan in Three Months
    The production and financial plan of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Tianjin Railway Bureau for the second quarter was implemented among the workers, who gained a clear understanding and consciously saved national wealth. After the head of the depot announced the production and financial plan to all workers, various teams began discussions. The workers said, "In the past, when using materials, no one knew how much they cost. Now we have a baseline!" Team A of the First Inspection Workshop formulated a production and financial plan to reduce costs by 15.9% compared to the planned cost. Workers of Team A of the Repair Workshop said, "Team A of the First Inspection Workshop has made a plan, we must catch up!" Workers of Team A of the First Inspection Workshop automatically sought to learn from Team A of the First Inspection Workshop on how to formulate a plan. During the discussions, everyone proposed, "Our support for the Korean War cannot be just lip service, we must show practical action." Workers of Team A of the First Inspection Workshop proposed reducing costs by 15% on the premise of ensuring quality. The Transportation Workshop proposed a production plan to reduce planned costs by 25%. The Riveting Team understood the production and financial plan and felt that twelve people in the team were too many, so they automatically requested the superiors to transfer four people. The superiors, considering the hot weather, only transferred three. The Boiler Washing Team also calculated the accounts and reduced one person from the existing twenty-four. The Independent Team also carefully calculated the accounts and felt that manpower was being wasted. In the past, when repairing locomotives, workers of Team A and Team B of the Repair Workshop had to replace the connecting rod sleeves of the locomotive as soon as they exceeded the limit. Now, they use waste products disassembled from the First Inspection Workshop—worn saddle sleeves—and slightly machine them to replace the connecting rod sleeves. Each connecting rod sleeve averages 250,000 yuan, and they have already saved 14, totaling 3.5 million yuan. Riveting Team production group member Fu Zhenming and welding group member Zheng Helin saw that everyone was reducing costs, and they said anxiously, "Everyone else is taking action, we must do something too!" They found many waste flue pipes in the ditch, so they tried to revive the waste flue pipes. In June, they revived five large flue pipes and one hundred and fifty small flue pipes, saving a total of more than 56 million yuan. In the past, the tinsmithing team turned the zinc filings from the crosshead slippers into blocks and handed them over to the material warehouse. Each block wasted one kilogram. Now, they hand in and receive broken filings, saving 50 kilograms a month, saving 2 million yuan. The lathe team proposed a goal of one hundred days without accidents. The team had three accidents every day in March, while only one accident occurred every day in June. Worker Wang Binggong has not had an accident for seventy-six days.
    Since fuel accounts for 45.98% of the total cost of the depot and 69.22% of the operating cost, the Transportation Workshop proposed saving coal as the main direction of everyone's efforts, and everyone studied the reasons for saving coal on a typical locomotive (No. 1751). Before each departure, locomotive No. 1751 estimated how much coal would be used on this trip; after returning, it checked why coal was saved and why it was wasted. Everyone agreed that the method of locomotive No. 1751 was good. During the discussion, stoker Shi Xianglin reviewed and said, "Why couldn't we do it in the past? It's because we didn't keep accounts. We took a chance. We saved if we saved, and we wasted if we wasted!" Young stoker Meng Zhaohai personally went to the old stoker to study how to save coal, and then returned to his own car to experiment, and as a result, he saved 1.5 tons of coal a day. Since the workers of the Transportation Workshop of the depot knew the importance of saving coal, the depot has also achieved great results in saving coal. From June 1st to June 15th, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive saved coal worth 5.22 million yuan, a reduction of 16.4% compared to the plan. Locomotive No. 1751 saved more than 5.82 million yuan.
    The employees of the depot consciously struggled to reduce costs. The actual cost in April was reduced by 12% compared to the planned cost; in May, it was reduced by 22.5%. After the June settlement, the entire depot saved more than 1 billion yuan in the second quarter. (Xi Neng'an, Peng Cheng, Yu Helin)
    Liu Wuzong Rapid Tunneling Team of Datong Mine Sets New National Tunneling Record
    Due to the rising patriotic enthusiasm of all the workers and the absorption of the advanced production experience of the Ma Liuhai team, the Liu Wuzong multi-hole rapid tunneling team of the No. 302 and No. 504 lanes of the No. 1 Mine of the State-owned Datong Coal Mine has revised the team's patriotic pact, improved the labor organization and drilling and blasting techniques, and production efficiency has been rising. Since July 23, they have continuously created three new highest records.
    The Liu Wuzong tunneling team has a total of twelve people, divided into three shifts for production. Their lane is 3.6 meters wide and 2 meters high. They use electric drills for drilling, and the quota is 7.2 meters. However, in order to support the Korean War with practical actions, they have set a plan to tunnel 350 meters for the whole month and strive to reach 400 meters. Therefore, after creating two new records on July 23 and 29 (tunneling 18.2 meters on July 23 and 20 meters on July 29), they created a new national record of tunneling 23 meters, with an average efficiency of 1.917 meters per worker, on August 1.

    Nanjing Workers Complete Power Transmission Project Across the Yangtze River, Relieving Drainage Difficulties for Farmland on Bagua Island
    Workers from the Nanjing Electric Power Bureau and factories and mines such as the Ma'anshan Mining Bureau completed the Bagua Island power transmission project across the Yangtze River in early July, solving the drainage difficulties for farmland on the island, changing the local situation of "nine years of no harvest in ten years," and creating favorable conditions for increasing agricultural production in the future. After the completion of this project, the farmers of the island held a celebration meeting and wrote letters to the worker brothers who participated in the project, expressing their heartfelt thanks for their help.
    Bagua Island is surrounded by the river on all sides and has low-lying terrain, and is often plagued by inland floods during the summer and autumn. In the past, waterwheels and diesel engines were used for drainage, but they were often ineffective due to machine failures and fuel difficulties, and every year, 15,000 mu of land (one-fourth of the island's farmland) would be flooded. In May of this year, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government decided to build a power transmission project across the river in order to use electric power for drainage and avoid the disasters of previous years. The Nanjing Electric Power Bureau was responsible for all the work such as erecting power lines and installing cables. In order to complete the project as scheduled before the summer flood season and ensure the farmers' autumn harvest, the workers used many sections of cables to connect into a long cable, overcoming the difficulty of temporarily manufacturing long cables. After two months of efforts and two tests, a cable 200 meters longer than the river surface finally passed through the Yangtze River and reached Bagua Island. The cable joints not only did not leak water but also could withstand the huge water pressure at the bottom of the river. The overhead line work was also completed quickly. After the successful erection of the power line across the river, they also received assistance from nine factories such as Yongli Alkali Plant, Ma'anshan Mining Bureau, and Water Plant, which lent 13 motors, and all 11 diesel pumps at the original five drainage stations were converted into electric drainage machines. When installing the motors, the electrical workers worked all night long, and the workers of the Huayi Electrical Manufacturing Plant insisted on working even though their eyes were bloodshot.
    The cross-river power transmission project was completed in early July and immediately started electric drainage. Now the accumulated water in all places has been drained, and green crops are growing everywhere on the island. Even the lowest-lying land that had never yielded grain in the past has grown rice, soybeans, and corn. It is estimated that the farmers on the island will harvest more than 5 million catties of grain every year as a result.

    Overcoming the Difficulties of Hazardous Terrain, the Reconstruction Telecommunications Project of the Baoji-Tianshui Railway is Completed
    The Telecommunications Engineering Team of the Northwest Railway Mainline Engineering Bureau overcame the difficulties of hazardous terrain and completed the telecommunications reconstruction project of the Baoji-Tianshui Railway ahead of schedule.
    The area traversed by the Baoji-Tianshui Railway has dangerous terrain, and most of the line passes through continuous mountain peaks and countless cliffs and precipices, and the roadbed is next to the rapid Wei River. Therefore, in this telecommunications reconstruction project, many power lines had to be erected on uneven rocks or on high and steep mountain waists. In this case, the work of laying lines and erecting poles was very difficult. For example, in the section between Guchuan and Linjiacun, there were mostly steep cliffs, and it was extremely difficult to climb on them. The workers took off their shoes, walked barefoot, tied the power lines to their bodies, and slowly climbed down the steep mountains without any vegetation to climb, holding the lines with one hand and supporting the hillside with the other. The workers on the mountain who were releasing the power lines from the wire-laying vehicle released the power lines little by little. If they were a little negligent and released the lines too fast or loosened them a little, the workers who were pulling the lines down the mountain would fall down the mountain. In this way, the workers finally carefully and tensely overcame the difficulties of laying lines between more than 30 mountain peaks and mountain streams.
    The workers also came up with ways to overcome the difficulties of transporting materials. For example, when encountering a river crossing without a bridge or boat, they used electric poles to make rafts and put the electrical materials on them to transport them across. When encountering steep slopes, they used protruding rocks or large trees on the mountain to install pulleys and pull the poles and other materials up the mountain, which saved labor and avoided the danger of carrying them by manpower.
    In such difficult and dangerous circumstances, due to the engineering team's leaders paying attention to on-site safety and accident prevention work, no casualties occurred in the more than seven months from the start of construction to completion.
    The project was originally scheduled to be completed at the end of July, but it was completed on July 13. During the acceptance inspection, the quality of the project was very good.

　　工人阶级的伟大力量！
    丰台机务段工人努力降低成本  三个月为国家节省十亿元以上
    天津铁路局丰台机务段第二季度生产财务计划贯彻到工人群众中去，工人群众心中有了数，自觉地节省了国家财富。在该段段长向全体工友公布了生产财务计划以后，各小组展开讨论。工人们说：“以往干活用材料，谁也不知多少钱，这回可有个底啦！”甲检乙组工人制订了较计划成本减低百分之十五点九的生产财务计划，包修甲组工人说：“甲检乙组作了计划，咱们要迎头赶上！”甲检甲组工人自动找甲检乙组工人学习怎样订计划。在各组讨论中，大家提出：“咱们抗美援朝不能光用嘴抗，要有实际的表现。”甲检甲组工人提出在保证质量的基础上减低成本百分之十五。运转车间提出了减低计划成本的百分之二十五的生产计划。铆工组了解了生产财务计划，认为本组十二人太多，自动请上级调出四人。上级以天气太热，只调出三人。洗炉组也算了账，从现有二十四人中减去一人。独立组也细细地算了一下账，认为人力也太浪费。包修甲、乙两组工人过去检修机车时，机车所用的连结杆套只要超过限度，就得换新的。现在，他们利用甲检拆下的废品——滑坏的鞍子套，稍加旋削，代替连结杆套。每个连结杆套平均二十五万元，现已节省十四个，共节省三百五十万元。铆工生产组傅振明和熔接组郑荷林看见大家都在减低成本，他们着急地说：“人家都动了，咱们也得干呀！”他们在地沟上发现很多废烟管，于是想办法把废烟管复活。在六月份他们复活了大烟管五根，小烟管一百五十根，共节省五千六百多万元。白铁组过去把十字头滑靴刨下的五金锌末，化成块，交给材料库。化一块，就浪费一公斤。现在改成交碎末、领碎末，一个月少浪费五十公斤，节省了两百万元。旋床组提出了百日无事故的奋斗目标，该组在三月份每天出三件事故，而六月份每天只出一件事故。工人王秉功已有七十六天未出事故。
    由于燃料占全段成本的百分之四十五点九八，占运转成本的百分之六十九点二二。因此，运输车间提出以节煤为大家的主要奋斗方向，大家研究了典型机车（一七五一号）节省用煤的原因。“一七五一号”机车每趟出发前，估计这趟车用煤多少；回来后，检查为什么省了和为什么费了。大家一致认为“一七五一号”机车的办法好。在讨论中，司炉史祥林检讨说：“咱们过去为什么不行呢？就是因为不算账，碰大运，省就省啦，费就费啦！”青年司炉孟昭海亲自去找老司炉研究怎样省煤，然后回到自己车上试验，结果一天省煤一点五吨。自从该段运输车间工人们知道省煤的重要性之后，该段在省煤方面也获得了很大成绩。从六月一日至十五日的十五天中该段“毛泽东号”机车节省价值五百二十二万元的煤，较计划减低百分之十六点四。“一七五一号”机车节省五百八十二万余元。
    该段职工群众自觉地为降低成本而斗争，四月份实际成本较计划成本减低百分之十二；五月份减低百分之二十二点五。六月结算后，全段在第二季度节省十亿元以上。（奚能安、彭城、于鹤林）
    大同矿刘五宗快速掘进组  又创全国最高掘进新纪录
    国营大同煤矿第一矿四号井三○二、五○四巷刘五宗多孔道快速掘进组，由于全组工友们爱国热情的高涨，以及吸取了马六孩组的先进生产经验，重新修订了小组爱国公约，改进了劳动组织和打眼放炮的技术，生产效率一直上升，从七月二十三日起，连续地创造了三次最高新纪录。
    刘五宗掘进组共十二人，分三班生产，他们的巷道是三公尺六宽两公尺高，用电钻打眼，定额是七公尺二十公分。可是他们为了以实际行动抗美援朝，订出全月掘进三百五十公尺争取达到四百公尺的计划。因此，在七月二十三、二十九两日连创两次新纪录之后（七月二十三日掘进十八公尺二十公分，二十九日掘进二十公尺），更于八月一日创造了掘进二十三公尺、每工平均效率一公尺九十一公分七的全国最高新纪录。（马良）
    南京工人完成过江供电工程  解除了八卦洲农田排水困难
    南京市电业局和马鞍山矿务局等厂矿职工于七月初完成八卦洲过江供电工程，解决了该洲农田排水的困难，改变了当地“十年九不生”的情况，为今后农业增产创造了有利条件。当这一工程完成后，全洲农民曾召开庆祝大会，并写信给参加这一工程的工人兄弟，衷心感谢他们的帮助。
    八卦洲四面环江，地势低洼，夏秋期间常常内涝成灾。过去用水车、柴油机排水，常因机器故障和油料困难，作用不大，每年总有一万五千亩田（占全洲田亩的四分之一）被淹。今年五月，南京市人民政府决定兴建过江供电工程，以便使用电力排水，免除历年灾害。架设电线、安装电缆等全部工程由南京市电业局负责。工人们为了争取在夏汛前如期完成这一工程，保证农民的秋收，曾利用许多段电缆接成一条长电缆，克服了临时制造长电缆的困难。经过两个月的努力和两次试验，一条比江面还长二百公尺的电缆，终于穿过大江，通达八卦洲。电缆接头处不但不漏水，且能承受江底的巨大水压力。架线工作也迅速完成。过江电线架设成功后，又得到了永利铔厂、马鞍山矿务局、自来水厂等九个工厂借出十三部马达的援助，把原有五处排水站的十一部柴油抽水机全部改装为电力排水机。在装置马达时，电气工人通宵工作，华义电气制造厂工人把眼睛都熬红了，仍坚持工作。
    过江供电工程于七月初全部完成后，即开始电力排水。现各处积水均已排干，全洲到处长着绿油油的庄稼，连过去从未收过粮食的最洼的田地，也长起了水稻、黄豆、苞米。估计全洲农民每年将因此多收粮食五百余万斤。

    克服了艰险地形的重重困难  宝天铁路改建电讯工程完成
    西北铁路干线工程局电务工程队，克服艰险地形的困难，提前完成宝（鸡）天（水）铁路改建电讯工程。
    宝天铁路经过的地区，地形险恶，线路大部穿过连绵的山峰和无数的悬崖绝壁，路基旁边又是急湍的渭河。因此，在这段电讯的改建工程中，有很多电线要架设在凸凹的岩石上或是又高又陡的山腰上。在这种情况下，放线、立杆工作都是非常困难的，如固川、林家村区间，多是峭严陡壁，在上面爬行都极端困难，工人们就脱了鞋，光着脚，把电线拴在身上，由没有草木可以攀拉的陡立的山上，一手把着线，一手扶着山坡，慢慢向下爬。山上看线车放电线的工人把电线一手一手往下放，假如稍微疏忽一点，把线条放快或放松一些，下山拉线的工人就会坠落山下。就这样，工人们终于小心地、紧张地克服了三十多处山头与山涧之间放线的困难。
    工人们还想出办法，克服了运料的困难。如遇到渡河没有桥没有船的时候，就用电杆作成木筏，把电料放在上面运过去。遇到陡立的山坡，就利用山上的凸石或大树，装上滑车把电杆等材料拉上山去，这样又省力，又免去用人力抬发生危险。
    在这样艰难、危险重重的情况下，由于工程队的领导人员重视现场的保安防险工作，从开工到完工七个多月的时间里，没有发生一次伤亡。
    该工程原定七月底完成，结果在七月十三日就全部完成了。在验收时，工程质量都很良好。
