Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 22nd Urgent Dispatch: Tonight (22nd) at 10:20 PM (Korean time), an enemy aircraft suddenly flew over the Kaesong neutral zone meeting site area, dropping bombs and strafing. Details of the enemy air raid are currently under investigation.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 22nd: On the morning of August 19th, at 5:55 AM, armed personnel of the United Nations forces, who had infiltrated the neutral zone in advance, murdered Yao Qingxiang, platoon leader of our military police, and seriously wounded our soldier Wang Renyuan. After a thorough investigation by both sides, the chief representative of our delegation lodged a serious protest with the other side at 9:30 PM on the same day, demanding severe punishment of the murderers and a complete guarantee that no further incidents violating the neutral zone agreement would occur. However, the chief representative of the United Nations forces delegation did not reply until 10:00 AM on August 21st, stating that "preliminary reports have not confirmed your accusations." Our delegation considered this irresponsible reply completely unsatisfactory and expressed indignation at the other side's attempt to deny the well-established facts.

Less than three hours after the above-mentioned incident of the United Nations forces deliberately violating the neutral zone agreement occurred, we notified the other side to send personnel to jointly investigate the scene. During the investigation at the scene, both sides listened to reports from local residents and our military police personnel, and examined the physical evidence at the scene, all of which fully confirmed that the United Nations forces had indeed illegally infiltrated the neutral zone and shot and killed our comrades Yao and Wang. Colonel Murray, liaison officer of the United Nations forces delegation, admitted the truth of the incident on the spot, as the evidence was irrefutable. Therefore, if the other side had the sincerity to solve the problem, this incident should have been resolved without further investigation, and our reasonable demands should have been accepted, giving us a satisfactory reply. However, two days later, Joy, the chief representative of the United Nations forces delegation, still claimed that he had not received a complete report and did not give a concrete response to our protest. It is clear that they want to delay the speedy resolution of the incident and deny their responsibility for deliberately violating the neutral zone agreement. The attitude of the United Nations forces delegation in delaying and shirking responsibility for this incident stands in stark contrast to our previous responsible attitude in quickly resolving the accidental incident of our guards mistakenly entering the meeting site area in order to ensure the smooth progress of the negotiations. The deliberate violation of the neutral zone agreement by the United Nations forces and their perfunctory attitude in handling this incident, combined with the absurd position taken by the United Nations forces delegation in the meeting to insist on establishing the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone within our positions, which has led to the lack of progress in the armistice negotiations, clearly shows that the United Nations forces are intent on violating the neutral zone agreement and obstructing the negotiations. The reporter learned from reliable sources that if the United Nations forces delegation cannot give our side a satisfactory reply to this issue quickly, our delegation will take further measures.

　　美方蓄意破坏朝鲜停战谈判
    敌机竟轰炸开城会址地区
    美方对其杀害我军事警察事件无耻抵赖
    如不速予满意答复我将采取进一步措施
    【新华社开城二十二日急电】今晚（二十二日）十时二十分（朝鲜时间）有敌机一架突然飞来开城中立区会址地区上空投弹、扫射。敌机空袭详情现正调查中。
    【新华社开城二十二日电】预先潜入中立区之联合国军武装人员，于八月十九日上午五时五十五分，谋杀我方军事警察排长姚庆祥，并重伤我战士王仁元，经过双方调查确凿以后，我方代表团首席代表在当日下午九时三十分，向对方提出严重抗议，要求严惩凶手，并彻底保证不再发生任何违反中立区协议的事件，但联合国军代表团首席代表，迟至八月二十一日上午十时始予答复，并谓“初步报告未证实你方所作指责”。我方代表团对于这种不负责任的答复，认为根本不能满意，对于对方企图否认证据确凿的事实更表示愤慨。
    在上述联合国军故意破坏中立区协议事件发生后，不及三小时，我方即通知对方派员共同至现场调查。双方在出事地点调查中，听取了当地居民及我方军事警察人员的报告，检视了出事地点的物证，均充分证实了联合国军确曾非法潜入中立区，并枪杀及枪伤我姚、王两同志。联合国军代表团联络官穆莱上校，以证据确凿无可辩驳，曾当场承认事件之真实性。因此对方如确有解决问题之诚意，此一事件原已无须再作调查，即应接受我方的合理要求，予我方以满意答复。乃事隔两日，联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃竟犹推说：尚未得到完全报告，对我抗议不作具体答复。显欲拖延事件之迅速解决，及抵赖其蓄意破坏中立区协议之责任。联合国军代表团对于此事件，所采取的拖延与推卸责任的态度，与我方前此对于我方警卫人员误入会址区偶发事件，为使谈判顺利进行，而迅速加以解决的负责态度，适成一完全相反的对照。由联合国军方面这一蓄意破坏中立区协议的会外事件及其对处理此一事件所持之敷衍态度，和联合国军代表团在会议中所采取的坚持将军事分界线与非军事区建立在我方阵地之内的荒谬立场，致使停战谈判迄无进展一事联系观察，可见联合国军方面破坏中立区协议及阻挠谈判之心，实已昭然若揭。记者从可靠方面获悉：如联合国军代表团不能迅速对此一问题给我方以满意答复时，我方代表团将采取进一步措施。
