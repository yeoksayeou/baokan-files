　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 29th: It is reported that General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, in his second protest letter to General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, on the 27th, once again distorted the facts, insisting that our liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, on the morning of August 23rd, while conducting a joint investigation with the opposing liaison officer into the August 22nd incident of United Nations military aircraft bombing the Kaesong neutral zone, clearly refused the opposing liaison officer's request to continue the investigation after dawn and to preserve all evidence at the scene. As the Chief Representative of the United Nations Forces, Vice Admiral Joy, initially fabricated this baseless slander in his report to General Ridgway regarding this matter, and the spokesperson of our delegation’s statement regarding this incident, as well as General Nan Ri’s statement regarding this incident, have thoroughly exposed this clearly malicious slander. However, General Ridgway, disregarding the facts, has once again brought up this slander to cover up the illegal actions of United Nations military aircraft bombing the Kaesong neutral zone. To further clarify the truth of the matter, the reporter visited our liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, who issued the following statement to the reporter:

　　"The United Nations Forces have repeatedly claimed that on the morning of August 23rd, when the liaison officers of both sides jointly investigated the incident of United Nations military aircraft bombing and strafing our delegation's residence, I refused the opposing liaison officer's request to come back to investigate after dawn. This is an utterly shameless lie. Not only did I not refuse the other party's request to come back to investigate after dawn, but I also clearly stated that if the other party felt it necessary to investigate again, we welcomed the other party to investigate again, and the other party could come at any time. During the on-site investigation on the morning of August 23rd, Colonel Kenny, the liaison officer of the United Nations Forces delegation, expressed his unwillingness to conduct the investigation from beginning to end. When our side notified the other side and requested them to immediately send personnel to conduct a joint investigation, the other side's liaison officer excused himself by saying it was late at night and refused to come. Under our side's stern and resolute request, after the investigation began, Colonel Kenny expressed his disdain to continue the investigation as soon as he began to inspect the first bomb crater and shrapnel. After that, every time he inspected a bomb crater, Colonel Kenny showed an impatient attitude and repeatedly urged his assistant, Colonel Mulry, to terminate the inspection. After our side insisted on continuing the investigation, Colonel Kenny excused himself by saying it was raining and suggested coming back to check after dawn. The dialogue between the two sides at that time was as follows:

　　Colonel Kenny: "It's dark and raining, I'll come back and see when it's dawn."

　　Colonel Zhang Chunshan: "We should conduct a detailed investigation now. What's wrong with investigating now? Isn't this enough evidence? Since it's raining, this evidence may change color, it may be washed away by the rain."

　　Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen (our liaison officer): "We may need to take some oil back for analysis."

　　Colonel Kenny: "I will include these issues in my consideration, I will come back to see when it's dawn."

　　Colonel Zhang Chunshan: "Your responsibility is to investigate. I cannot be satisfied with your irresponsible attitude."

　　Colonel Kenny: "We will investigate after dawn."

　　Colonel Zhang Chunshan: "I don't want to lose time, the rain may wash away some evidence."

　　Colonel Kenny: "Steel won't be washed away."

　　Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen: "What about oil?"

　　Colonel Kenny: "Oil won't mix with water."

　　Colonel Zhang Chunshan: "As far as we are concerned, we believe the investigation is over. But if you think it is necessary to investigate again, we welcome you to investigate again. You should notify us by phone in advance for the investigation."

　　This is the final dialogue between the two sides, and this is the entire record of the discussion between the two sides regarding the issue of re-investigation after dawn. I am willing to confront Colonel Kenny about the authenticity of this conversation record. I believe that respecting the facts is the most basic requirement of an honest soldier."

　　我方联络官张春山上校发表声明
    指斥李奇微诬我拒绝复查谰言
    发表关于再行调查的谈话记录向美方联络官对质
    【新华社开城二十九日电】据悉：联合国军总司令李奇微将军，在其今日复朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军，及中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军二十七日第二次抗议书中，再次歪曲事实，硬说我方联络官张春山上校，于八月二十三日清晨，在与对方联络官共同进行调查八月二十二日联合国军军用飞机轰炸开城中立区事件时，曾明白拒绝对方联络官天亮后继续进行调查，及保留一切证据于现场的要求。记者按联合国军首席代表乔埃海军中将在其就此事向李奇微将军作的报告中，初次捏造这个毫无根据的谰言，我代表团发言人关于此次事件的谈话，及南日将军对于此次事件的声明中，已彻底揭穿了这个显然怀有恶意的谰言。但李奇微将军不顾事实，竟又提出这一谰言，为联合国军军用飞机轰炸开城中立区的不法行为作掩护。记者为进一步明了事情的真相，特就此事走访我方联络官张春山上校，承其向记者发表如下声明：
    “联合国军方面一再宣称，八月二十三日早晨，双方联络官共同调查联合国军军用飞机轰炸与扫射我方代表团住所的事件时，我曾拒绝对方联络官在天亮后再来调查的要求，这是彻头彻尾的无耻谎言。我不但没有拒绝对方在天亮后再来调查的要求，并且还明白地声明，如果对方认为有再来调查的必要，我们欢迎对方再来调查，对方尽可随时前来。八月二十三日早晨双方进行实地调查中，联合国军代表团联络官肯尼上校，自始至终就表示不愿意进行调查。当我方通知对方要求立即派员前来共同进行调查时，对方联络官是托辞夜深，不肯前来。在我方严辞坚决要求之下，调查开始后，肯尼上校在刚刚开始检查第一处弹坑和弹片时，就表示不屑于继续调查。此后每视察一处弹坑，肯尼上校都表示不耐烦态度，并且还一再催促他的助手穆莱上校，终止视察。在我方坚持继续调查后，肯尼上校又托辞天雨，主张天亮后再来查看。当时双方的对话如下：
    肯尼上校：“天又黑，又下雨，天亮的时候我再回来看”。
    张春山上校：“我们应该现在就进行详细的调查，现在调查有什么不好呢？难道这些证据还不够吗？既然天雨这些证据就可能变色，它们可能被雨水所冲掉”。
    柴成文中校（我方联络官）：“我们可能要取一些油回去分析一下”。
    肯尼上校：“我将会把这些问题包括在我的考虑之内，天亮时我再回来看”。
    张春山上校：“你的责任就是来调查的，我不能满意你的不负责的态度”。
    肯尼上校：“我们等天亮以后再来调查”。
    张春山上校：“我不愿意失去时间，雨水可能冲去一些证据”。
    肯尼上校：“钢铁是不会被冲去的”。
    柴成文中校：“油呢”？
    肯尼上校：“油是不会与水混合的”。
    张春山上校：“就我们来说，我们认为调查已经结束了。但如果你们认为有必要再来调查，我们欢迎你们再来调查，调查要事先用电话通知我们”。
    这是双方最后的对话，这也是关于天亮后再行调查问题双方讨论的全部记录。我愿就这个谈话记录的真实性，向肯尼上校对质。我以为尊重事实是一个诚实军人的最起码的条件”。
