The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Holds Construction Industry Trade Union Work Conference
Discussing Strengthening Construction Industry Trade Union Work
Proposing Methods such as Implementing Democratic Management and Abolishing Feudal Foremen

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened a construction industry trade union work conference from June 11th to 21st to discuss the issue of strengthening construction industry trade union work. Thirty-six people participated in the meeting, including construction industry trade union workers from major administrative regions and several central cities, as well as administrative responsible cadres from construction enterprises in the North China, East China, and Southwest China administrative regions.

According to reports from various regions, the current construction industry still suffers from serious chaos. Due to lack of organization, planning, leadership, and management, speculative profiteering, shoddy workmanship, perfunctory attitudes, and deceptive practices are prevalent everywhere. This results in poor project quality, significant rework and waste, and substantial losses to the country. A general inspection of construction projects in the Fushun Mining Bureau in the first half of 1950 revealed that more than half had quality problems. In the house contracted by the Datong City Victory Construction Company for the Yanbei Prefectural Committee, bricks in the walls could be pulled out by hand. Furthermore, the rule of foremen, multi-layered subcontracting, and feudal exploitation are also very serious. Some projects are subcontracted up to seven times; the foremen's exploitation accounts for 50% to 70% of the total wages, and the workers only receive 30% to 50% of the wages they should receive.

Due to the fact that local construction trade union organizations focused primarily on establishing production cooperatives when they were first organized, and did not emphasize production, their work lost its focus. Therefore, out of 472,626 construction workers, only 183,309 have joined the trade union so far. Construction trade union organizations have not played their due role in educating workers, improving workers' work attitude, ensuring project quality and timely completion of project tasks, and protecting workers' interests by improving production.

The meeting also introduced some relatively successful experiences from construction trade union organizations in various regions. For example, the China Construction Company Trade Union established an on-site trade union at the Beijing Jiaotong Bank construction site, eliminating intermediate exploitation and solving some of the workers' immediate difficulties. The workers' morale was high, and under the leadership of the on-site trade union, a labor emulation drive was launched, which played a significant role in ensuring project quality and saving resources. When the North China Textile Administration Bureau's state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill was building its factory buildings, an on-site management committee was established due to the promotion of the on-site trade union. The implementation of democratic project evaluation not only improved project quality, but also completed the project six days ahead of schedule.

After ten days of discussion and research, the meeting proposed some methods for reorganizing and reforming the construction industry. For example: the trade union organization, the client (i.e., the owner), and the contracting engineering company should jointly organize an on-site management committee on the construction site to implement democratic management; abolish the foreman system and multi-layered subcontracting system, sign collective contracts, eliminate intermediate exploitation, and enhance the sense of responsibility of employees; gradually standardize the specifications of building materials; and systematically eliminate waste in construction, etc.

The meeting pointed out that in order to effectively reorganize and reform the construction industry, it is first necessary to strengthen construction industry trade union work. The meeting suggested that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions establish a Construction Industry Trade Union Work Committee to prepare for the establishment of a unified construction industry trade union organization, in order to strengthen the leadership of construction industry trade union work nationwide.

Finally, the meeting made a resolution based on the above opinions, which, after being approved by the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, was recommended to the relevant authorities for adoption and implementation.

　　全国总工会召开建筑业工会工作会议
    讨论加强建筑业工会工作
    提出实行民主管理取消封建把头等办法
    中华全国总工会，在六月十一日到二十一日，召开了一次建筑业工会工作会议，讨论加强建筑业工会工作问题。参加会议的，有各大行政区和几个中心城市建筑业工会工作者及华北、华东、西南三大行政区的建筑企业行政负责干部等三十六人。
    据各地代表反映：目前的建筑业，还存在着严重的混乱现象。由于无组织、无计划、无领导、无管理，所以投机倒把、偷工减料、敷衍塞责、欺骗蒙蔽的行为，到处皆是。这就使工程质量甚差，反工浪费很多，给国家带来重大的损失。抚顺矿务局一九五○年上半年的建筑工程，经普遍检查的结果，其中质量有毛病的达半数以上。大同市胜利建筑公司包修的雁北地委的房子，墙上的砖竟可以用手拔出。另一方面，把头统治、层层转包、封建剥削的情况，也非常严重。有的工程转包达七层；把头的剥削，占工资总数的百分之五十到七十，工人实得只占应得工资的百分之三十到五十。
    各地建筑工会组织，由于开始组织工会时，大部分致力于建立生产合作社，没有着重面向生产，工作失掉重心。因此，在四十七万二千六百二十六个建筑工人中，到现在加入工会的只有十八万三千三百零九人。在教育工人、改进工人的劳动态度，保证工程质量和准时完成工程任务，以及从提高生产中来保护工人的利益这几方面，建筑业工会组织都没有发挥它应有的作用。
    会议也介绍了各地建筑业工会组织中一些比较成功的经验。如中国建筑公司工会，在北京交通银行工地成立了现场工会，取消了中间剥削，解决了工人的一些切身困难；工人工作情绪高涨，在现场工会领导下，展开了劳动竞赛，对保证工程质量和节约方面，都起了不小的作用。华北纺织管理局国营天津第一棉纺织厂在修建工房时，由于现场工会的推动，成立了现场管理委员会。实行民主评验工程，不但工程质量提高了，而且提前六天完工。
    会议经过十天的讨论、研究，提出了一些整理与改革建筑业的办法。例如：工会组织与委托者（即业主）、承包工程公司三方面在工地组织现场管理委员会、实行民主管理；废除把头制和层层转包制，订立集体合同，取消中间剥削，提高职工群众的责任感；逐步地统一建筑材料的规格；有步骤地消灭施工的浪费现象等等。
    会议指出：为要切实整理和改革建筑业，首先必须加强建筑业工会工作。会议建议中华全国总工会成立建筑业工会工作委员会，筹备建立统一的建筑业工会组织，以加强全国建筑业工会工作的领导。
    最后，会议根据上述各种意见作出了决议，由中华全国总工会常务委员会批准后，建议有关机关采纳执行。
