At the meeting, after Vice Chairman Zhang Nanxian of the Central South Military and Political Committee and Mayor Wu Defeng of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government delivered send-off speeches, Head of the Visiting Group Xie Juezai delivered a reply. Head Xie stated: "The visiting group will convey the concern of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the people of the whole country for the people of the old revolutionary bases to the people of the old revolutionary bases, and will also certainly convey the concern of the people of Wuhan for the people of the old revolutionary bases to the people of the old revolutionary bases."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 9th. The Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi sub-group of the Central People's Government Southern Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Group arrived in Pingjiang County on the morning of the 9th. Farmers came from thirty miles away to welcome them, bringing rice ears—the fruits of their victory after liberation—as gifts to the visiting group. Along the way, the masses enthusiastically cheered slogans such as "The old Red Army has returned" and "Long live Chairman Mao." The visiting group arrived in Pingjiang County at 1:00 p.m., the place where General Peng Dehuai launched the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. The mood of the welcoming masses was even higher, with firecrackers being set off everywhere. More than 400 representatives of families of martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and families of revolutionary staff members, and more than 40 veteran Red Army soldiers stood at the front of the welcoming ranks. They seemed to see relatives when they saw the representatives of the visiting group, asking questions and expressing special concern for Chairman Mao. The Pingjiang County Democratic Women's Federation, hearing that the visiting group was coming, spent more than two months embroidering a letter to Chairman Mao, embroidered with: "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal health." An old woman named Qi, over 70 years old, brought her child to set off firecrackers to welcome them. She said that she had already received many benefits since liberation and was grateful to Chairman Mao from the bottom of her heart. A family member of a martyr surnamed Zhang took a flower and asked the visiting group to give it to Chairman Mao, saying that after liberation, each member of his family had been allocated more than two mu of land and was living a good life. Chen Zaili, deputy head of the visiting group, spoke to the welcoming masses. When he said "Chairman Mao cares very much about the people of the old revolutionary bases," the masses applauded enthusiastically and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"
