Oppose Waste of Timber, Oppose Indiscriminate Logging!
    Jilin, Heilongjiang and other Provinces Logging and Selling "Local Timber"
    Harms National Forests and Causes Timber Market Chaos
    The People's Governments of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Songjiang, Liaodong and other provinces in Northeast China, proceeding from the perspective of local finance, have been logging and selling "local timber," causing damage to national forests and creating chaos in the timber market. The forests of Northeast China are state-owned and are managed and logged uniformly by the Northeast Forest Industry General Bureau. However, the People's Governments of Heilongjiang and other provinces in Northeast China, citing self-use and the need to solve local people's need for timber, requested and were approved by the Northeast People's Government to log a portion of "local timber." In reality, very little of the "local timber" in all the above-mentioned provinces is used for self-use, and all or most of it is sold to the market to subsidize local financial expenditures. According to incomplete statistics, from 1948 to 1951, the total volume of "local timber" logged by the provinces was 729,000 cubic meters. Among them, Jilin Province accounted for 260,000 cubic meters, Heilongjiang Province for 240,000 cubic meters, and Songjiang Province for 151,000 cubic meters. Except for a small amount used for self-use, most of it was sold on the market. Liaodong Province logged a total of 78,000 cubic meters from 1948 to 1950, and aside from self-use, also sold a portion to the market. This has resulted in the following adverse effects:

    (1) In the logging of timber by the provinces, with the exception of Songjiang, which entrusted all of it to forestry agencies, and Liaodong, which entrusted a portion, the general practice is to hire workers for logging independently. During logging, they use the "shaved head" method, paying no attention to leaving mother trees, not protecting saplings, leaving high stumps, and not clearing the forest, violating the principles of rational logging and causing the loss of national timber resources.

    (2) Since the main purpose of the provinces in logging timber is to sell it for profit, they went to Beijing, Tianjin and other places to promote timber sales from 1949 to 1950. More than 30 units from Jilin, Heilongjiang, Songjiang and other provinces went to Tianjin to promote timber sales. Although they no longer directly promoted sales within the customs after 1950, they still sold timber within the customs through private merchants or relevant agencies. At the same time, the sale of timber by the provinces has become one of the main reasons why certain agencies, troops, and schools within the customs go to the Northeast to purchase timber. In the purchase of timber, some agencies, troops, and schools within the customs collude with timber merchants or take advantage of personal relationships to resell it for huge profits. The result of the provinces' timber sales is chaos in the timber market.

    (3) The local logging areas and the logging areas of forestry agencies are intertwined. Some local governments, due to the temporary urgent need for skilled logging workers, do not hesitate to set wages arbitrarily and hire fixed workers from forestry agencies at high prices. As a result, the workers' morale is unstable, which greatly affects the long-term logging operations of forestry agencies.

    Although the amount of "local timber" logged in Jilin, Heilongjiang and other provinces in Northeast China is not very large, the damage to the forests and the impact on the timber market cannot be ignored. Therefore, the provinces should proceed from the overall interests of national construction, examine their own local financial perspectives, thoroughly implement the policy of the Central People's Government that state-owned forest areas should be logged uniformly by forestry agencies, and stop logging "local timber." The Northeast People's Government should no longer approve the logging of "local timber" in order to eliminate the various adverse effects caused thereby, so that the country's forestry construction work can quickly get on the right track.

　　反对浪费木材，反对滥伐林木！
    吉林黑龙江等省采伐、销售“地方材”
    损害国家森林引起木材市场混乱
    东北黑龙江、吉林、松江、辽东等省人民政府从地方财政观点出发，砍伐及销售“地方材”，使国家森林遭受损害，木材市场发生混乱。东北的森林为国有林，归东北森林工业总局统一经营采伐。但东北黑龙江等省人民政府借口自用及解决地方民需用材，向东北人民政府请准采伐一部分“地方材”。实际上所有上述各省“地方材”的用途，很少是自用，而全部或大部分都是向市场推销，补助地方财政开支。据不完全统计，从一九四八年到一九五一年，各省“地方材”采伐总数为七十二万九千立方公尺。其中吉林省为二十六万立方公尺。黑龙江省为二十四万立方公尺，松江省为十五万一千立方公尺。除少数自用外，大部分都在市场上销售了。辽东省一九四八年到一九五○年共采伐七万八千立方公尺，除自用外，也拿一部分向市场出售。这样，就产生了以下不良影响：
    （一）各省在采伐木材中，除松江以全部、辽东以一部委托林业机关采伐外，一般的都是自行雇工伐木。在采伐时都是用“剃光头”的方法，不注意留母树，不保护幼树，伐根留得很高，不清理林场，违反了合理采伐的原则，造成国家木材资源的损失。
    （二）各省采伐木材的主要目的既是为了销售获利，因此在一九四九年到一九五○年曾到北京、天津等地推销木材。吉林、黑龙江、松江等省到天津推销木材的竟有三十多个单位。一九五○年以后虽不到关内直接推销，但仍有通过私商或有关机关在关内推销的。同时，各省的销售木材已成为引起关内某些机关、部队、学校到东北去购买木材的主要原因之一。关内各机关、部队、学校在购买木材中，有的通过木商，或利用私人关系，互相勾结，辗转贩卖，以获取厚利。各省销售木材的结果，使木材市场发生混乱。
    （三）地方的采伐区与林业机关的采伐区交错。有的地方政府由于暂时急需伐木的技术工人，不惜乱定工资，高价争雇林业机关的固定工人。结果，使工人们的工作情绪不安，大大影响了林业机关长年采伐作业的进行。
    东北吉林、黑龙江等省“地方材”的采伐量虽不算太大，但对森林的损害与对木材市场的影响是不可忽视的。因此，各省应从国家建设的整体利益出发，对自己的地方财政观点进行检查，彻底执行中央人民政府在国有林区由林业机关统一采伐的政策，停止采伐“地方材”。东北人民政府并应不再批准“地方材”的采伐，以消除由此而引起的各种不良影响，使国家的林业建设工作，能很快地走上正轨。
