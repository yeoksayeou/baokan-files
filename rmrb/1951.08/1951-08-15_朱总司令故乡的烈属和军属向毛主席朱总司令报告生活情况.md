To our dear Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

　　We are all poor farmers. Some of our children joined the Red Army in 1933, some secretly ran to Yan'an during the Anti-Japanese War to join the Eighth Route Army, some were conscripted into the Kuomintang army and joined the People's Liberation Army after being liberated in the Liberation War, and some gloriously joined the army after liberation to defend our country. We feel indescribably happy when we celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day of the People's Liberation Army. Looking back, the landlords and puppet township and bao officials exploited and oppressed us so cruelly! They forced us to pay rent and mortgages, and conscripted us, leaving us breathless. The families of Red Army soldiers suffered all kinds of oppression and persecution from the Kuomintang army. After liberation, everything changed. We not only straightened our backs, but also received the unanimous respect of the masses. People come to comfort us during various major and minor festivals. During the Spring Festival, representatives of the People's Government and the masses bring gifts and honorary plaques to offer us New Year greetings. As soon as the district head sees us, he asks: Are there any difficulties in life and production? How is the substitute farming work being done in the village? Have the children in the army sent letters? No one ever asked these questions in the past. When distributing relief grain and agricultural loans, we are always given priority. Those with special difficulties are also given preferential grain. For example, Zhu Liangshi, an old woman who sent two sons to the army, received two preferential grains from the Southwest Military Region, one of 300 catties of rice and one of 270 catties; she also received two preferential grains from the county, each of 80 catties. This is enough for the family to live on. The masses also enthusiastically help us solve our difficulties. When Peng Xianzhong's mother passed away, the neighboring farmers helped with the burial. When Pan Changqing's leg became ill, the substitute farming team helped him weed the fields. Pan Mingyan and Pan Mingzhi, substitute farming team members living in the same courtyard, also helped him carry water. When we lack cattle and farm tools, the masses compete to provide them for us. When we lack fertilizer and seeds, the government gives us priority in lending them to us. Thanks to everyone's help, our crops are growing very well this year. Although we had hail, drought, and insect pests a few months ago, none of these troubled us. Our crops are still planted completely, without any gaps.

　　Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: Thank you for your leadership and education, which has enabled our children to learn many skills in the army. For example, Zhu Xiangnan, the child of Zhu Shulu, was illiterate in the past, but now he can recognize more than a thousand characters. Our children can all write letters home themselves. What a great change! In their letters, they often say that their leaders and comrades care for them like fathers and brothers. They say that they must fight to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, defeat the aggression of American imperialism, and consolidate national defense. We also write letters to urge them to move forward and not to miss home. We will definitely do a good job in farming at home to support them. Now we have universally established patriotic covenants and increased production and donation plans. For example, Zhu Daiyin proposed to donate ten catties of ginned cotton and twenty catties of yellow grain from increased production. His wife, Zhu Wu, also proposed to ensure that she would raise pigs well, work hard to spin yarn, and actively support the front.

　　Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: We guarantee that we will fulfill every article of our patriotic covenant. We will encourage our children to be heroes. We ourselves must also maintain the title of "Glorious Family."

        Respectfully wishing you good health

                All the families of martyrs and military personnel in Linlang Village, Ma'anchang, Yilong County, North Sichuan

　　朱总司令故乡的烈属和军属
    向毛主席朱总司令报告生活情况
    亲爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    我们都是贫苦的农民。我们的子弟有的在一九三三年参加了红军，有的在抗日时期偷偷跑到延安参加了八路军，有的是被蒋匪军抓去当兵而在解放战争中被解放后参加解放军的，有的是解放后为了保家卫国而光荣参军的。在庆祝人民解放军“八一”建军节的时候，我们心中真有说不出的高兴。回想过去地主、伪乡保人员剥削压迫得我们好苦啊！逼租、逼押、拉壮丁，逼得我们气也喘不过来。红军家属更是饱受了蒋匪军的各种欺压迫害。解放后，一切都变了样子了。我们不但伸直了腰，而且受到了广大群众一致的尊敬。各种大小节日，人民都来慰问。春节时，人民政府代表和群众带着礼物和光荣牌，来给我们拜年。区长一看见我们就要问：生活上生产上有没有困难？村上代耕工作做得怎样？军队中的子弟有没有来信？这些在过去谁也没有来问过。发救济粮和农贷时，总是优先照顾我们。特别困难的还给发优待粮。如送了两个儿子参军的朱梁氏老太婆就领到西南军区发的两次优待粮，一次大米三百斤，一次二百七十斤；她又领到县上发的两次优待粮，每次都是八十斤。一家人的生活也就可以过了。群众还热心的帮我们解决困难。彭显忠的母亲去世时，邻近农民就帮助安葬。潘长清脚上生了病，代耕队就帮他把田薅了。同院住的代耕队员潘明雁、潘明志还帮他担水。我们缺牛缺农具，群众争着供给我们用。缺肥料种籽时政府又优先贷给我们。由于大家的帮助，今年我们的庄稼长得很好。虽然前几月这里下过冰雹，遭过天旱，起过虫害，但是这些都没有难着我们。我们的庄稼仍栽插完，没有缺窝。
    毛主席、朱总司令：感谢你们的领导教育，使我们的子弟在军队中学得很多本领。像朱书籙的孩子朱香南，过去一字不识，现在已认得一千多字了。我们的子弟都能亲笔写信回来。这是多大的变化啊！他们在信里常说首长、同志像父兄一样关怀他们。他们说一定要为消灭蒋匪帮，打垮美帝国主义的侵略，巩固国防而奋斗。我们也写信嘱咐他们努力前进，不要念家。家里一定做好庄稼，支援他们。现在我们已普遍订立了爱国公约和增产捐献计划。如朱代印提出要从增产中捐献十斤皮棉、二十斤黄谷。他妻子朱吴氏也提出要保证喂好猪，努力纺纱，积极支援前线。
    毛主席、朱总司令：我们保证我们的爱国公约条条作到。我们要勉励我们的子弟人人当英雄。我们自己也一定要保持住“光荣之家”的称号。
        敬祝   你们身体健康
                川北仪陇县马鞍场琳琅村全体烈、军属敬上
                                       七月二十五日  （新华社）
