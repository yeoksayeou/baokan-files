Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 18th: People of all circles in Northeast China warmly support the Beijing Military Control Commission's severe punishment of American government special agents and spies such as Li Andong and Yamaguchi Ryuichi, who conspired to carry out armed riots, unanimously believing that this is a major victory for the Chinese people in severing the claws of American imperialism's aggression.

Gao Chongmin, Chairman of the Northeast General Branch of the China Democratic League and Vice Chairman and Minister of Justice of the Northeast People's Government, said in a statement: The Chinese people have smashed the openly armed front of American imperialism, and they also have the full strength to completely smash its hidden front. He cited the case in the past where Northeast China uncovered the former U.S. Consulate in Shenyang shielding U.S. spy Sasaki Hirotsuna and others in carrying out espionage activities, as well as the cases where the U.S. spy agency CIC constantly sent special agents to sneak into Northeast China, pointing out: American imperialism's conspiracy to invade Northeast China is carried out simultaneously with open military actions on the Korean battlefield and hidden espionage activities. But facts have proven that American imperialism's saboteurs cannot escape the giant palms of the Chinese people. Ning Wu, Chairman of the Northeast Region Provisional Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that in connection with the recent case in Shenyang of uncovering the counter-revolutionary activities of the French priest Deschamps and other imperialist elements, everyone should be particularly vigilant about the destructive conspiracies of imperialist elements disguised in religious cloaks. Sun Pengxi, Chairman of the Northeast Conference of the Church of Christ in China, said: Madinuo wore the cloak of Catholicism, but secretly hid weapons. This matter should particularly arouse our vigilance. We must continue to carry out the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement to eliminate the imperialist special agents and spies within the church. Zhou Shaoxian, representative of the Shenyang Cultural and Educational Circles Catholic Reform Promotion Committee, believes that the era of imperialism enjoying privileges in China is gone forever. Whoever dares to carry out destructive activities in the people's China, we must severely punish them all according to the law.

People from all walks of life in Shenyang applauded this wise measure of the People's Government. Commanders and fighters of the public security forces stationed in Shenyang, workers in various factories, young students, and the broad masses of citizens expressed extreme indignation at the American government special agents and spies' conspiracy to assassinate Chinese leaders and leaders of the Central People's Government. Everyone unanimously believes that it is necessary to conscientiously promote patriotic covenants, do a good job in preventing traitors and maintaining confidentiality, carry out patriotic labor competitions, and donate more planes and artillery to completely smash the American imperialists' aggressive conspiracies.

In addition, various people's organizations in Northeast China and Shenyang City have issued statements unanimously supporting this just sentence, and called on members of their respective organizations to continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary elements, and completely cut off the claws of imperialism in order to consolidate our great motherland.

　　东北各界人民拥护严惩美国特务间谍
    一致表示要加紧抗美援朝工作粉碎美国侵略阴谋
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】东北各界人民热烈拥护北京市军事管制委员会严厉惩处阴谋进行武装暴动的美国政府特务间谍李安东、山口隆一等，一致认为这是我国人民斩断美帝国主义侵略爪牙的一次重大胜利。
    中国民主同盟东北总支部主任委员、东北人民政府副主席兼司法部部长高崇民发表谈话说：中国人民粉碎了美帝国主义公开武装的战线，也完全有力量彻底粉碎它的隐蔽战线。他例举过去东北破获的前美国驻沈领事馆掩护美国间谍佐佐木弘经等进行特务活动案，及美国间谍机关ＣＩＣ不断派遣特务潜入东北活动等案后，指出：美帝国主义侵略东北的阴谋，是以在朝鲜战场的公开军事行动，和隐蔽的间谍特务活动同时进行。但事实证明，美帝国主义阴谋破坏分子是无法逃出中国人民的巨掌的。中国国民党革命委员会东北区临时工作委员会主任委员宁武说，联系最近沈阳破获的帝国主义分子法籍神甫德尚朴等的反革命活动一案，大家要特别警惕披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子的破坏阴谋。中华基督教会东北大会理事长孙鹏翕说：马迪懦身披天主教外衣，暗中却藏着武器，这件事要特别引起我们的警惕。我们要继续开展三自革新运动，肃清教会内的帝国主义特务间谍分子。沈阳市文教界天主教革新促进委员会代表周绍先认为：帝国主义在中国享有特权的时代已经一去不复返了，谁敢在人民的中国进行破坏活动，我们就要一律依法严厉惩办它。
    沈阳市各阶层人民对人民政府这一英明措施，无不拍手称快。驻沈阳的公安部队的指挥员战斗员，各工厂职工，青年学生和广大市民，对于美国政府特务间谍阴谋暗杀中国元首和中央人民政府各首长，表示万分愤恨。大家一致认为：要认真推行爱国公约做好防奸保密工作，搞好爱国主义劳动竞赛，捐献更多的飞机大炮，来彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    此外，东北和沈阳市的各人民团体均发表声明，一致拥护这一正义的判处，并号召所属各团体的成员继续加强抗美援朝工作，坚决镇压反革命分子，彻底斩断帝国主义魔爪，以巩固我们伟大的祖国。
