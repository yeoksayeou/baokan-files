　　Seen from Small and Medium-Sized Factories in Beijing: We Must Strengthen the Party's Leadership over the Patriotic Compact Movement
    Xu Baolun
    The patriotic compact movement in various medium and small factories in Beijing has promoted both production and learning. Before the establishment of the patriotic compact in the Xin Jian Pharmaceutical Factory, the scrap rate for manufacturing 20cc ampoules of atropine was often between 30% and 50%. Now it has dropped to about 13%. The Li Hua Auto Repair Shop used to overhaul four vehicles per month, but now it overhauls six. After the Zhen Hua Flour Mill established its patriotic compact, it produced more than 2,000 extra bags of flour each month, and the quality improved by 32%. A certain auto repair shop invented, improved, or imitated thirteen kinds of tools within two months. At the same time, work efficiency and labor discipline have also improved to some extent.
    However, there are still many shortcomings in the formulation and implementation of patriotic compacts. This has prevented the patriotic compact movement from achieving results commensurate with the political enthusiasm of the masses, and has led to a certain degree of formalism. These shortcomings are manifested in the following aspects:
    1.  In-depth publicity was not carried out during the formulation and revision process. The masses were not mobilized for full discussion based on the actual situation and problems. In individual factories, there was even a phenomenon of a small number of cadres taking over the process. The Li Xing Kui Iron Factory spent only three evenings, totaling no more than three hours, from conceiving to formally establishing the compact. On the first evening, the trade union asked each worker to write down a few opinions on a piece of paper. On the second evening, a few cadres synthesized the workers' opinions into a factory-wide patriotic compact. On the third evening, they read it to the workers, and it was considered established. When the Cooperative General Society Toothbrush Factory revised its patriotic compact, it neither proposed key points for revision based on the shortcomings found in the implementation process before the revision, nor did it conduct serious publicity. It simply gave a cursory lecture on the publicity points for establishing patriotic compacts issued by the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, and then revised it.
    2.  Lack of regular inspections after establishment. Many small factories do not have inspection systems or fixed inspection organizations and personnel. The Li Hua Auto Repair Shop has never conducted an inspection since the patriotic compact was established. The Zhen Hua Flour Mill has only inspected the implementation of individual patriotic plans twice since it was established in late April, and has never inspected or revised the entire patriotic compact. After the Cooperative General Society Toothbrush Factory established its patriotic compact, it ignored it for two months. It was not until the District Committee arranged for the revision of the patriotic compact in June that it hurriedly conducted an inspection. Although the Xin Jian Pharmaceutical Factory stipulated a weekly inspection system and elected inspectors in each group, it only conducted one inspection in a month and a half. Some inspectors were unwilling or dared not inspect others because they had not played a model role in implementing the patriotic compact themselves.
    3.  Lack of political publicity, criticism, and commendation during the implementation process. According to our investigation in four factories, including the Li Hua Auto Repair Shop, none of the factories had a current affairs report system; nor did any of the factories have systematic publicity about the patriotic compact itself or criticism and commendation regarding the implementation of the patriotic compact. Among them, the Li Hua Auto Repair Shop had only one blackboard bulletin, which did not play a significant role. Only two of the 188 employees in the Xin Jian Pharmaceutical Factory read newspapers. The Zhen Hua Flour Mill had not even told the workers about the Korean armistice negotiations.
    4.  Failure to fully utilize the backbone role of Party members and Youth League members in the formulation, especially in the implementation, process. The Party and Youth League branches of factories such as the Xin Jian Pharmaceutical Factory, Li Hua Auto Repair Shop, Zhen Hua Flour Mill, and Cooperative General Society Toothbrush Factory have never checked how Party members and Youth League members implement the patriotic compacts in Party and Youth League meetings; they have never used criticism and self-criticism to supervise Party members and Youth League members and make them stand at the forefront of the patriotic compact movement. According to rough statistics, only about half of the Party members and Youth League members in the above four factories can play a model and leading role.
    5.  Some factories only established factory-wide patriotic compacts; some factories only formulated plans for individuals to implement the factory-wide patriotic compacts. The former is not easy to implement, and the latter is too fragmented and not easy to inspect each other.
    The reason for the above shortcomings is primarily due to many incorrect understandings in leadership thinking:
    1.  Some comrades believe that: "The patriotic compact is a 'formality,' and it is useless to establish it." The production committee member of the Li Hua Auto Repair Shop trade union said: "The patriotic compact is useless. It doesn't mean you can't produce if you don't establish a patriotic compact." Once, the trade union director asked him to discuss the patriotic compact issue, and he said: "Forget it, forget it, I have other things to do!"
    2.  Some comrades believe that: "The patriotic compact is similar to the production plan. It doesn't matter whether you establish it or not." When we investigated the patriotic compact movement at the Cooperative General Society Toothbrush Factory, we asked the organization committee member of the factory's CCP branch: "Why establish a patriotic compact?" He said: "Establishing a patriotic compact gives us a 'goal'." We then asked: "Doesn't production have a goal if you don't establish a patriotic compact?" He replied: "We didn't have a production plan in the past." So we asked again: "Then, is it okay to establish a production plan but not a patriotic compact?" He said: "I don't know about that."
    3.  Some comrades believe that: "The patriotic compact is good, but it cannot solve major problems." They oppose the patriotic compact to the central task. The Xin Jian Pharmaceutical Factory launched a factory-wide "security inspection" in July, separated from the patriotic compact movement. We asked an administrative person in charge (an old Party member): "Why not combine the 'security inspection' with the inspection of the patriotic compact and further enrich the content of the patriotic compact?" He said: "The patriotic compact is useful for supervising daily production work, but it is not feasible to rely on the patriotic compact to solve problems such as inspecting and maintaining machines and establishing maintenance systems."
    In addition, erroneous understandings such as "The patriotic compact cannot be too specific, otherwise it is not a patriotic compact" and "The patriotic compact is not easy to link with reality" also exist among some cadres.
    These erroneous ideas about the patriotic compact are reflected in the leadership style as relaxation and abandonment of leadership over the patriotic compact movement. Many factory Party branches have not systematically studied the patriotic compact issue; there is no one specifically responsible for leading the patriotic compact movement. After the workers of the Cooperative General Society Toothbrush Factory established the patriotic compact, they saved a lot of toothbrush bristles, but when they asked the trade union to calculate the amount of savings for them, the trade union director said: "Too much trouble, I don't care." As a result, the workers said very discouragedly: "Just implement the patriotic compact with a clear conscience!"
    Leadership lags behind objective requirements, leadership lags behind the masses. This is the fundamental reason for the existence of a certain degree of formalism in the patriotic compact movement.
    Therefore, the district Party committee organization should first conduct an education on the patriotic compact for factory cadres, so that they fully recognize the important role of the patriotic compact in organizing the masses, educating the masses, and promoting production and work; so that they fully recognize that: the patriotic compact is established by the masses themselves, but if it is not led and left to its own devices, it cannot fully play its role. At the same time, we should adopt the method of using key experiences to promote general factories, and help each factory overcome the tendency of formalism in the patriotic compact movement. Only in this way can the patriotic compact movement be greatly advanced.

### 从北京市中小工厂看  必须加强党对爱国公约运动的领导

　　从北京市中小工厂看  必须加强党对爱国公约运动的领导
    徐宝伦
    北京市各中、小工厂的爱国公约运动对生产和学习都起了推动作用。新建制药厂订立爱国公约前制造二十西西大安瓿的报废率经常是百分之三十至百分之五十，现在已降到百分之十三左右。利华汽车修配厂以前每月大修四辆车，现在每月大修六辆。振华面粉厂订立爱国公约以后每月多产两千多袋面，质量提高百分之三十二。某汽车修理厂两个月内发明、改进、仿造十三种工具。同时工作效率和劳动纪律也都有些改进。
    但是，在爱国公约的订立和执行过程中还有许多缺点。这样就使爱国公约运动没有取得和群众政治热情相适应的成绩，并有一定程度的形式主义倾向。这些缺点表现在以下几方面：
    一、订立和修订时没有进行深入的宣传工作，没有根据实际情况和问题发动群众充分讨论，个别工厂甚至有少数干部包办代替的现象。利兴魁铁工厂连酝酿订立和正式订出，只用三个晚上，总共不过三个小时的时间。第一天晚上，工会让每个工友写了一张纸条，提出几点意见；第二天晚上，几个干部把工友们的意见综合成一个全厂爱国公约；第三天晚上，给工友念一遍，就算订出来了。合作总社牙刷工厂修订爱国公约时，既没根据修订前在执行过程中发现的缺点提出修订重点，也没认真地进行宣传，只是把市委宣传部所发的关于订立爱国公约的宣传要点草草地讲一遍，就修订出来了。
    二、订立以后缺乏经常检查。很多小工厂没有检查制度和固定的检查组织、检查人员。利华汽车修配厂订立爱国公约以后从未检查。振华面粉厂由四月下旬订出到现在只检查了两次个人爱国计划的执行情况，对整个爱国公约则从未检查、修订。合作总社牙刷工厂订出爱国公约以后，不闻不问地把它放了两个月，到六月份区委布置修订爱国公约的工作才匆忙地检查了一次。新建制药厂虽然规定了一周一次的检查制度，并在各小组内推选出检查员，但在一个半月内只检查过一次，有些检查员因自己在执行爱国公约中未起模范作用，所以也不愿或不敢检查旁人。
    三、在执行过程中缺乏政治宣传工作和批评、表扬。根据我们在利华汽车修配厂等四个工厂进行调查的结果，没有一个工厂有时事报告制度；也没有一个工厂有关于爱国公约本身的系统宣传或关于执行爱国公约的批评、表扬。其中利华汽车修配厂全厂只有一块黑板报还不大起作用。新建制药厂全厂一百八十八个职工只有两个人读报。振华面粉厂连朝鲜停战谈判的事都没有向工人们讲过。
    四、在订立、特别是执行过程中没有充分发挥党员团员的骨干作用。新建制药厂、利华汽车修配厂、振华面粉厂、合作总社牙刷工厂等工厂党和团的支部从未在党和团的会议上检查党员团员如何执行爱国公约；从来没有用批评、自我批评的方法来监督党员团员，使他们在爱国公约运动中站在最前列。据不精确的统计：在上述四个工厂中能起模范作用和带头作用的党员团员仅占全体党员团员的二分之一。
    五、有的工厂只订了全厂性的爱国公约；有的工厂只订了个人执行全厂性爱国公约的计划。前者不易执行，后者太零散不易互相检查。
    发生以上缺点原因，首先是因为领导思想还有许多不正确的认识：
    一、有些同志认为：“爱国公约是‘形式’，订了也没用处。”利华汽车修配厂工会生产委员说：“爱国公约什么事也不顶，订了爱国公约不生产也不行。”有一次工会主任找他研究爱国公约问题，他说：“算了，算了，我还有旁的事呢！”
    二、有些同志认为：“爱国公约和生产计划差不多，订不订都可以。”在调查合作总社牙刷工厂爱国公约运动时，我们问该厂中共支部组织委员：“为什么要订爱国公约？”他说：“订爱国公约就有个‘目标’了。”我们又问：“不订爱国公约难道生产就没有目标了吗？”他回答：“过去我们没生产计划。”于是，我们又问一句：“那么，订生产计划不订爱国公约行不行呢？”他说：“那我就不知道了。”
    三、有些同志认为：“爱国公约很好，但是解决不了大问题。”把爱国公约和中心工作对立起来。新建制药厂在七月份脱离爱国公约运动进行了一次全厂规模的“保安大检查”，我们问一位行政负责同志（老党员）：“为什么不把‘保安大检查’和检查爱国公约结合起来、进一步充实爱国公约的内容呢？”他说：“爱国公约对督促日常生产工作有用处，但是要靠爱国公约来解决检查保养机器、订立保养制度等问题，就不行了。”
    此外，“爱国公约不能订得太具体，否则就不是爱国公约了。”“爱国公约不好联系实际。”等错误认识在一部分干部中也存在着。
    这些对爱国公约的错误思想，反映到领导作风上就是放松和放弃对爱国公约运动的领导。许多工厂党的支部没有系统研究过爱国公约问题；没有专人负责领导爱国公约运动。合作总社牙刷工厂工友们订立爱国公约以后节省了很多牙刷毛，但是在他们要求工会替他们算一算节约数量时，工会主任却说：“太麻烦，我不管。”因而工友们很灰心地说：“凭良心来执行爱国公约吧！”
    领导落后于客观要求，领导落后于群众。这就是爱国公约运动中存在着一定程度的形式主义倾向的基本原因。
    因此，党的区委组织首先应对工厂干部进行一次关于爱国公约的教育，使他们充分认识到爱国公约在组织群众、教育群众、推动生产和工作方面的重要作用；使他们充分认识到：爱国公约是群众自己订立的，但如果不加领导，任其自流，是不能充分发挥作用的。同时，应采取以重点取得经验推动一般工厂的方法，帮助各厂克服爱国公约运动中的形式主义倾向。只有这样，才能把爱国公约运动大大地向前推进一步。
