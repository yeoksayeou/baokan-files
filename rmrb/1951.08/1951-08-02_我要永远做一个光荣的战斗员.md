　　I want to always be a glorious fighter
　　Female combat hero of the Fourth Field Army Guo Junqing
　　This year's "August 1st" is the 24th anniversary of the founding of the powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army. This is a day of very great significance. Because, if it were not for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's leadership of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese revolution would not have been victorious, and the suffering people of the whole country would not have been able to stand up. But the attainment of this victory was not easy.
　　I joined the People's Liberation Army in the autumn of 1945. At that time, the people's strength was already quite strong, but our struggle with the enemy was still extremely difficult. I remember one night in the winter of 1946, the northwest wind was blowing fiercely, and it was snowing heavily. At that time, I was a cavalry messenger. The cavalry squad leader ordered me and another comrade to deliver the order to "Baiyin Mutu" (place name), sixty miles away, within four hours, and to mobilize the troops to rush back to carry out the mission immediately. I accepted the task assigned by the squad leader and rode my horse through the ravines in the heavy wind and snow, using the light of the snow. The road was rugged and difficult to travel, and bandits were hiding in the mountains. However, when I thought that I was a soldier under the leadership of Mao Zedong, I was not afraid at all. When I arrived at "Baiyin Mutu", I was naturally tired, but the task was successfully completed.
　　At that time, although we were marching towards victory by leaps and bounds, the material conditions were still quite difficult. In winter, we wore sheepskin clothes, which were not very neat. When we encountered wind and snow, we still felt cold. The weapons were not very good, and there was not much ammunition. No one was willing to waste a bullet. However, in the situation that Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale civil war and launched a massive offensive against the liberated areas, in order to defend the fruits of the people's victory, we fearlessly met the enemy and persisted in the armed struggle. Under the correct leadership of the Party, we thought, "There are no difficulties that cannot be overcome!" In fact, we did exactly that. Therefore, we finally defeated the enemy and eliminated the Kuomintang reactionaries.
　　We have won victory, but now American imperialism has come to invade us again, and is also preparing to illegally conclude a peace treaty with Japan, not allowing us to live a happy life; therefore, we must establish a strong and modern national defense army to protect our motherland well. I am determined to always be a fighter of Chairman Mao! (Fourth Field Army News Section)

　　我要永远做一个光荣的战斗员
    第四野战军女战斗英雄  郭俊卿
    今年“八一”是强大的中国人民解放军诞生二十四周年纪念日。这是一个有着非常伟大意义的日子。因为，假使没有共产党和毛主席领导下的中国人民解放军，中国革命便不会胜利，全国受苦受难的老百姓也不能翻身。但这个胜利的获得是不容易的。
    我是一九四五年秋天参加人民解放军的，当时人民的力量已经相当强大了，可是，我们和敌人的斗争仍然万分难苦。我记得在一九四六年冬天的一个夜晚，西北风刮的很厉害，又下着鹅毛大雪。那时候我当骑兵通讯员。骑兵班长命令我同另一位同志在四小时内把命令送到六十里外的“白音木图”（地名）去，调部队马上赶回来执行任务。我接受了班长交给的任务，在大风雪中，借着雪的亮光骑着马在山沟里跑。道路崎岖难行，山里又窝藏着土匪。但是，我一想到我是毛泽东领导下的战士，便一点害怕都没有了。赶到“白音木图”，累自然不用说，但任务是胜利地完成了。
    那时候，我们虽然是大踏步走向胜利，物质条件还是相当困难的。冬天我们穿的是羊皮衣服，也不怎么整齐，遇见刮风下雪，还觉得冷飕飕的，武器不怎么好，弹药也不多，谁也不肯浪费一颗子弹。可是，在蒋介石发动大规模内战向解放区大举进攻的情况下，我们为了保卫人民的胜利果实，奋不顾身地迎击了敌人，坚持了武装斗争。在党的正确领导下，我们想的是：“没有克服不了的困难！”实际上也完全这样作了。所以，我们终于战胜了敌人，消灭了国民党反动派。
    我们是胜利了，可是现在美帝国主义又来侵略我们，还准备非法对日媾和，不让我们过幸福的生活；所以，我们一定要建立一支强大的现代化的国防军，把祖国保卫好。我决心永远作一个毛主席的战斗员！（四野新闻科）
