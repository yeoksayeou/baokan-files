    The Eight Heroes Who Would Rather Die Than Surrender
    By Jiang Ping
    (X) The enemy launched a third offensive with two battalions. The heroes truly achieved one shot per enemy. Li Bingqun and Hou Tianyou threw out the last two anti-tank grenades, and the enemy was blown down. The heroes took the opportunity to move towards the cliff behind them.
    (XI) Soon, the enemy surged up again. The heroes pointed their empty guns at the enemy, and the timid enemy quickly lay down.
    (XII) At this time, behind the heroes was a five-zhang high cliff. Deputy Platoon Leader Li ordered party member Qu Guoling, non-party soldier Hou Tianyou, and Luo Juncheng to provide cover. Then he issued the order: "Volunteer soldiers would rather die than surrender! Comrades, jump!"

    （十）敌人用两个营兵力，发动第三次冲锋。勇士们真是做到了一枪打一个，李秉群和侯天佑扔出了最后两颗反坦克雷，敌人被炸倒了。勇士们就乘机向身后悬崖移动。
    （十一）不久，敌人又涌上来。勇士们端起空枪对准敌人，胆怯的敌人就赶紧卧倒了。
    （十二）这时，勇士们的背后就是五丈高的悬崖。李副排长命令党员瞿过灵、非党战士侯天佑、罗俊成三人担任掩护，然后他发出命令：“志愿军战士宁死不屈！同志们跳啊！”
