The Central Flood Control Headquarters issued instructions on strengthening flood control work to various regions and important river water conservancy and flood control agencies on July 25. The full text of the instructions is as follows:

Since July 3, heavy rains have fallen in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. On the 14th, the water level in Shashi reached a maximum of 43.43 meters, exceeding the danger level by 1.13 meters. The Jingjiang Dike once had a breach due to a badger hole, but it was fortunately repaired before causing a disaster. In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, in southern Anhui and southern Jiangsu provinces, exceptionally heavy rain occurred (rainfall in Anqing reached 416 mm in three days), and some areas experienced flash floods and waterlogging. In the Huai River basin and the Yishu River area in northern Jiangsu, continuous heavy rains also occurred in mid-July. Except for some areas in the Huangchuan and Lu'an prefectures on the south bank of the Huai River, which experienced flash floods and waterlogging, the situation in other areas is relatively stable.

Up to now, although our flood control work has achieved initial victories, according to general rules, the next month or so is the most critical stage of flood control work nationwide. Water conservancy and flood control agencies in various regions and river basins should continue to be vigilant and step up dike inspection and flood control preparations in order to overcome floods and ensure this year's bumper harvest.

(1) For rivers that have experienced or are experiencing rising water levels, such as the Yangtze River, the Pearl River, the Yishu River, and the Huai River basin, all forces should be used to strengthen flood control and overcome floods. At the same time, during the intervals between floods, efforts should be made to inspect and repair dikes and to conduct systematic and organized drainage work in waterlogged areas. Flood control leading organs at all levels should grasp the changes in water conditions, understand the actual situation in various places, and provide timely and specific guidance for these tasks.

(2) Although the water situation in the Yellow River and various rivers in North and Northeast China is currently stable, and there is even drought in some areas, it should be understood that once the flood season begins, there is always the possibility of heavy rain. The above-mentioned regions and river water conservancy agencies should conscientiously check the flood control organizations of the masses and the dikes along the rivers to prevent complacency. For some rivers, such as the Yellow River and the Yongding River, where riverbed alluvial changes are more frequent, because the initial flood volume is not large or the water has not yet risen, and the riverbed has not yet been scoured, local flood control agencies must especially estimate the dangerous situations that may occur when the water rises suddenly, and take strict precautions to ensure safety.

### 中央防汛总指挥部发布防汛指示

　　中央防汛总指挥部发布防汛指示
    中央防汛总指挥部于七月二十五日向各地区及各重要河流水利机构和防汛机构发出关于加强防汛工作的指示。指示全文如下：
    自七月三日起，长江上中下游普降大雨，十四日沙市水位最高达四三点四三公尺，超过危险水位一点一三公尺。荆江大堤曾因獾洞发生漏洞，经抢堵后幸未成灾。长江下游皖南、苏南地区，因遭特大的暴雨（安庆三天降雨量曾达四一六公厘），部分地区曾发生山洪及内涝灾害。淮河流域及苏北沂、沭河区，七月中旬，亦曾发生连续暴雨。除淮河南岸的潢川专区和六安专区的部分地区曾发生山洪及内涝灾害以外，其余各地情况尚平稳。
    截至现在，我们的防汛工作，虽已取得初步胜利，但按一般规律，今后的一个多月内，是全国防汛工作最紧要的阶段，各地区各流域水利机构和防汛机构都应继续提高警惕，加紧堤防检查和防汛准备工作，以期战胜洪水，保障今年的农产丰收。
    （一）曾经一度涨水或正在涨水的河流，如长江、珠江、沂、沭河和淮河流域，应用一切力量加紧防汛、战胜水灾。同时要抓紧洪水间歇期间，检查修补堤防，并对内涝地区进行有系统有领导的排水工作。各级防汛领导机关，对这些工作，要掌握水情的变化，了解各地实际情况，及时进行具体的指导。
    （二）黄河及华北、东北各河，目前水情虽尚平稳，个别地区甚至有干旱现象，但须知既入汛期，随时有发生暴雨的可能，以上地区及流域水利机构应切实检查群众的防汛组织与沿河堤防，以防止麻痹大意。部分河流如黄河、永定河等，河槽冲积变化较多，因初汛水量不大或尚未涨水，河槽尚未冲开，当地防汛机构尤其必须估计到骤然涨水时可能发生的险恶情况，严加防范，以策安全。
