　　Fushun Municipal Government Employee Consumer Cooperative Council and Supervisory Committee Chairmen's Self-Criticism Regarding the Cooperative's Illegal Speculation

    Editor's Note: The facts of the Fushun Municipal People's Government Employee Consumer Cooperative's illegal speculation and the handling of the matter were reported in the Readers' Letters column of this newspaper on August 14th. The following is the self-criticism of the responsible persons of the cooperative's council and supervisory committee.

        From the very beginning of its establishment, the Fushun Municipal Government Employee Consumer Cooperative lacked a clear understanding of policy and failed to grasp the cooperative economic policy. A cooperative is a semi-socialist economy, a mass collective economic organization, but the Municipal People's Government Employee Consumer Cooperative, with the purpose of profit sharing, became a capitalist-style joint-stock store. Because the management policy was determined from a profit-making point of view, serious errors existed in the management methods and the handling of capital profits, all violating policy.

    Under the domination of our erroneous thinking of profit-making and dividend distribution, we made many wrong decisions, such as: First, the original limit was no more than ten shares per person (300,000 yuan per share, then Northeast currency, the same below), which was later increased to thirty shares, allowing a few people to invest a lot of money. Second, all profits were distributed, without retaining funds, welfare funds, etc., completely lacking a perspective of developing collective undertakings. What was particularly serious was that after September 1950, disregarding the provisions of the Cooperative Law, it was decided to continue distributing large dividends.

    Although individual comrades of the council had realized as early as July 1950 that this practice violated policy and had raised corrective opinions, these opinions were not corrected because the majority disagreed. In February 1951, when the superior cooperative decided to order us to suspend business for inspection, we decided without requesting instructions or reporting, to "start over if we made a mistake" and "close the door and withdraw shares." Not only did we fail to learn from the mistake, but we also created a very bad influence among the masses.

    The council did not discuss how to determine the management policy in accordance with the cooperative economic policy and act in accordance with the regulations, and the supervisory committee never inquired about the cooperative's business operations. The council and supervisory committee made illegal resolutions, believing that as long as "money was made and dividends were distributed, it was good." This resulted in the phenomenon of impersonation in the issue of shareholding in the Municipal People's Government Cooperative; in business operations, there were erroneous behaviors such as buying white sugar from state-owned stores and wholesaling it to private merchants, and buying cloth and transporting it to Shenyang for sale. This was completely illegal behavior that violated cooperative policy.

    The main reason for this error was the rampant individualistic erroneous thinking of profit-making and dividend distribution. We did not study or attach importance to policies and laws, and we did not respect or implement the instructions of the superior cooperative. Many comrades in the council had a tendency toward degeneration and corruption, attempting to achieve the goal of personal gain and enjoyment, thus losing their position, abandoning their responsibilities, and failing to recognize the seriousness of being government workers and not implementing government laws and policies. The supervisory committee also lost its position, abandoned its responsibilities, and went along with the tide, so that one mistake led to another, causing undue political losses to the government.

    In short, the illegal acts of the Municipal People's Government Employee Consumer Cooperative should be the sole responsibility of the council and supervisory committee. In addition to making a profound self-criticism, we request that the higher authorities give us the due punishment.

        Supervisory Committee Chairman Wang Jingwu

### 抚顺市政府职工消费合作社理监事会主任  对于该社违法进行投机买卖的检讨

　　抚顺市政府职工消费合作社理监事会主任
    对于该社违法进行投机买卖的检讨
    编者按：抚顺市人民政府职工消费合作社违法进行投机买卖的事实和处理经过，已见本报八月十四日读者来信栏，下面是该社理、监事会负责人的检讨。
        抚顺市人民政府职工消费合作社在成立开始时，对政策方针就不明确，没有掌握合作经济政策。合作社本是半社会主义的经济，是群众性的集体经济组织，而市人民政府职工消费合作社，则以分红为目的，成为资本主义式的合股商店。因为经营方针是从营利观点出发所确定的，所以在经营方式上，以及对资金利润的处理上，都存在违反政策的严重错误。
    我们在营利分红的错误思想支配下，曾做了许多错误的决定，如：一、原定每人不能超过十股（每股三十万元，当时东北币，下同），后增至三十股，使少数人得以投入很多钱。二、将利润全部分掉，不留基金、福利金等，毫无发展集体事业观点。尤其严重的是在一九五○年九月后，竟不顾合作法的规定，决定继续大量分红。
    虽然理事会个别同志于一九五○年七月起，即已认识到如此做法是违反政策的，曾提出纠正意见；但由于多数不同意，结果仍没有得到纠正。一九五一年二月上级社决定令我们停止营业、进行检查时，不经请示报告，擅自决定“错了重来”，“关门抽股”。既不能接受错误的教训，更在群众中造成了很坏的影响。
    理事会没有讨论过如何按合作经济政策确定经营方针并按章办事，而监事会也从未过问合作社经营情况，理、监事会并非法决议，认为只要是“赚了钱，分到红，就是好的”。因此造成了市人民政府合作社在入股问题上的冒名顶替现象；业务经营上有从国营商店买来白糖批发给私商，买布运沈阳出卖等错误行为，这完全是违犯合作政策的非法行为。
    产生此种错误原因，主要是个人主义的营利、分红错误思想作祟。对政策法令不学习，不重视，对上级社指示不尊重，不执行。在理事会中不少同志存在堕落腐化的思想倾向，企图达到个人赚钱享受的目的，因此丧失了立场，放弃了职责，未能认识到身为政府工作人员，不执行政府法令政策的严重性。而监事会也丧失立场，放弃职责，同流合污，以致一错再错，给政府造成不应有的政治损失。
    总之，市人民政府职工消费合作社的非法行为，应由理、监事会负完全责任。除作深刻检讨外，并请求上级给以应有的处分。
        抚顺市人民政府合作社理事会主任  陈建候
            副主任  杜越
        监事会主任  王经五
