　　Overcoming Two Biases in Cotton Purchase and Storage Propaganda

　　In this patriotic cotton selling and storage movement, newspapers in major cotton-producing areas have, since early June, devoted considerable space to propaganda and education on carrying out the patriotic cotton selling and storage movement. This work has played a significant role in raising cotton farmers' awareness and enabling them to understand their correct relationship with the new country.

　　However, some reports in certain newspapers often neglected the political mobilization of cotton farmers, focusing solely on the methods of commercial purchase or resorting to coercive measures.

　　Regarding the neglect of political mobilization and the exclusive promotion of commercial purchasing methods, the Hubei Daily demonstrated such shortcomings in some of its reports. For instance, the report "Suixian Lishan Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Branch Company Actively Purchases Cotton" in the "Economic News" column on page two of the June 5th edition, and the report "How Department Stores Cooperate with Cotton Purchase and Storage Work" in the same column on page two of the June 20th edition, were entirely about the methods of purchasing cotton. These numerous purchasing methods were naturally appropriate and necessary, but the problem was the lack of political mobilization, the failure to combine the supply of materials with political mobilization, and the mere adoption of the same commercial purchasing methods as usual, that is, using a simple "purchasing relationship" to "stimulate" cotton farmers to enthusiastically sell and store cotton. The consequence of such propaganda is that it is difficult to "promote a patriotic movement of selling and storing cotton to resist America, aid Korea, and protect the homeland" (instructions from the CCP Central Committee to all levels of Party committees to ensure the completion of cotton purchase and storage tasks), and it also easily fosters selfish psychology among farmers.

　　On the other hand, some reports in some newspapers, although combining patriotic propaganda, adopted simple and rigid methods, also exhibiting coercive measures. The Hebei Daily, in two news reports, promoted some excessively high slogans. For example, in the news "Party Members, Youth League Members, and Labor Models Play a Pioneer Role" on page three of the June 21st edition, the women's mutual aid group of Cui Xiaoting, a labor model from Beidaliu Village in Lixian County, proposed: "No household should keep a single jin of surplus cotton"; and in the news "Gao Guandou Writes Back to Huang Youfu and Yan Jinfen" on page three of the June 27th edition, it was proposed: "Mobilize cotton farmers not to keep even a single jin of stored cotton." The Changjiang Daily also promoted such slogans twice. In the article "Patriotic Cotton Selling and Storage Craze Among Farmers in Daying Town" excerpted from the Henan Daily on page two of the July 5th edition, there was the slogan: "Kong Xian, a standing committee member of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, also stated at the meeting: 'We must respond to the farmers' challenge of not keeping a single liang of cotton.'" The communication "Selling Cotton, Loving the Country" on page two of the July 20th edition further praised: Farmers in Chenliu County strived to sell and store more cotton, and also "proposed the slogan of not keeping a single liang of stored cotton." The Youth League branch of Liu Tie Village held a meeting and decided: "Implement the slogan of not keeping a single liang."

　　If these slogans are used by Party members, Youth League members, and cadres themselves as examples to lead the way in responding to the call for cotton selling and storage, it is perfectly acceptable; moreover, such a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm is also worthy of praise. However, if used as action slogans to mobilize cotton farmers, it will inevitably foster commandism. It is undoubtedly wrong to blindly promote these excessively high slogans without criticism. The error lies in: not using correct political education methods to enlighten and raise the political awareness of cotton farmers, but replacing the actions of the broad masses with the actions of a few activists. Because it exceeds the level of awareness of the masses and violates the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, it suffers from impatience.

　　Although the above two types of erroneous propaganda manifest themselves in different forms, the root cause of the errors is that they both emphasize one aspect while neglecting the other, and neither has fully or correctly implemented Chairman Mao's instruction that "the serious problem is to educate the peasants." Therefore, they either completely neglect the political mobilization of the peasants or adopt methods that are too simple and rigid.

　　Now that the work of cotton purchase and storage is still in a tense stage, newspapers must continue to strengthen political education for farmers through various practical works. Therefore, how to learn from the experience and lessons of this propaganda, overcome one-sidedness, and correctly implement the instruction that "the serious problem is to educate the peasants" is still a very important issue in the future.

### 克服购棉储棉宣传的两种偏向

　　克服购棉储棉宣传的两种偏向
    在这次爱国售棉储棉运动中，各主要产棉区的报纸从六月初旬起，都以不少的篇幅进行了关于开展爱国售棉储棉运动的宣传教育。这种工作对提高棉农的觉悟程度，使棉农懂得自己和新国家的正确关系，是有很大作用的。
    但是，在某些报纸的某些报道中，却往往忽视了对棉农的政治动员，而单纯宣传了商业收购方法，或强迫命令的方法。
    在忽视政治动员，单纯宣传商业收购方法方面，湖北日报在某些报道中表现了这样的缺点。例如六月五日二版《经济新闻》栏内《随县厉山花纱布支公司，积极收购棉花》的报道，六月二十日二版同一栏内《百货公司怎样配合购棉储棉工作》的报道，满篇谈的都是怎样进行收购棉花的方法。这许多收购方法，自然都是应当的、必要的，但问题在于缺乏政治动员，没有把物资供给与政治动员工作相结合；而仅仅采取了与平时一样的商业收购方法，即以单纯“购买关系”来“刺激”棉农踊跃售储存棉的方法。这样宣传的后果，既难“推动广大棉农开展一个抗美援朝保家卫国的售棉、储棉运动”（中共中央指示各级党委保证完成购棉储棉任务），又易滋长农民的自私心理。
    另一方面，有些报纸的某些报道中，虽结合了爱国主义的宣传，但其所采取的方法，简单、生硬，又表现了强迫命令。河北日报先后在两次新闻报道中，曾将一些过高的口号，进行了宣传。如在六月二十一日第三版“党员团员劳动模范发挥先锋作用”的新闻中，蠡县北大留村劳动模范崔小亭的妇女互助组所提出的：“每家不留一斤余棉”；又如在六月二十七日第三版“高贯斗给黄有富、阎金芬写回信”的新闻中所提出的：“动员棉农一斤存棉也不留”。长江日报也有两次宣传了这样的口号。该报七月五日第二版摘自河南日报的《大营镇农民的爱国售棉储棉热潮》一文中，就有“工商联合会常务委员孔宪也在会上表示：要响应农民‘不留一两棉’的挑战。”的口号；七月二十日第二版《卖棉花，爱国家》的通讯中，更作了进一步的表扬：陈留县的农民都争取多售储棉花，亦“提出不留一两存棉的口号”。刘铁村青年团支部便开会决定：“贯彻一两不留的口号”。
    这些口号如果作为党员、团员、干部自己以身作则，来带头响应售棉储棉号召，是完全可以的；而且，这种高度的爱国热情也是值得表扬的。但是，如果作为动员棉农的行动口号，则势必助长命令主义。对于这种过高的口号不加以批判地盲目宣传，无疑是错误的。其错误在于：不是以正确的政治教育方法，去启发和提高棉农的政治觉悟，而是以少数积极分子的行动代替了广大群众的行动。因为它超过群众的觉悟程度，违反了群众的自愿原则，害了急性病。
    以上两种错误的宣传，虽表现的形式不同，但错误的根源，则都是由于强调这一面，而忽视了另一面，都没有或没有完全正确地贯彻毛主席“严重的问题是教育农民”的指示，因而，不是完全忽视了对农民的政治动员，便是采取了过于简单、生硬的方法。
    现在购棉储棉工作仍在紧张阶段，报纸对农民的政治教育，仍须通过各种实际工作继续加强。因此，如何接受这次宣传的经验教训，克服片面性，正确地贯彻“严重的问题是教育农民”的指示，还是今后一个很重要的问题。
