Beijing Encephalitis Continues to Develop
All Units Should Pay Close Attention to Prevention Work
[This newspaper reported] The epidemic of encephalitis in Beijing is still developing. As of the 28th, there were a total of 377 suspected cases, of which 52 have died. After the Beijing Municipal People's Government issued an emergency notice, the people in all districts of Beijing city launched a concentrated effort to carry out prevention work. Most central and municipal-level agencies, factories, schools, and organizations have attached importance to prevention work, held emergency meetings, and deployed work to eliminate mosquitoes by "turning over pots and jars and blocking tree holes." All districts in the city have conducted general inspections in the past two days.
During this general inspection, it was found that some units still do not pay enough attention to prevention work. Some units have water tanks and basins breeding mosquito larvae, but they do not clean them up. They see mosquitoes flying around everywhere but do not eliminate them. When the District Health Committee goes to inspect, they adopt a perfunctory attitude. This is irresponsible to the public interest and should be severely criticized.
The water tank of the private Wansheng Hospital was full of mosquito larvae. Only when the inspectors were about to arrive did they temporarily spray DDT. The private Minsheng Hospital had many mosquito larvae in empty cans. The Infectious Disease Hospital and the General Hospital of the North China Military Region did not seriously carry out prevention work. The water tanks of Beining Midwifery School and the Red Cross Hospital were full of mosquito larvae. The Beijing Municipal Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Completion Middle School posted many slogans about preventing encephalitis at the school gate and in the yard, but not a single tree hole was blocked, and the mosquito larvae in pots and cans were not cleared. There are four tree holes that have not been blocked at the Municipal Boys' No. 6 Middle School, and there are mosquito larvae in the water tank of the Girls' No. 1 Middle School dormitory. The private Yongxing Chemical Factory in District 1 has not taken any action despite repeated urging by the District Health Committee. The Russian Language Training School and the Cadre School of the People's Bank of China both have tree holes that have not been blocked. These units should immediately take action to do a good job in preventing encephalitis.

　　京市大脑炎仍在发展
    各单位应切实注意预防工作
    【本报讯】北京市流行性脑炎疫情仍在发展。截至二十八日止，疑似病例共有三百七十七人，其中死亡者五十二人。北京市城内各区人民自市人民政府发出紧急通告后，曾突击进行预防工作。中央及市级各机关、工厂学校、团体大都重视预防工作，召开了紧急会议，布置了“翻盆倒罐堵树洞”消灭蚊子的工作。城内各区最近两天分别进行了普遍检查。
    在这次普遍检查中，发现还有一些单位不重视预防工作的现象。有的单位水缸、水盆里滋长着孑孓，却不去清除，看到蚊子到处乱飞不去消灭；区卫生委员会去检查时，采取敷衍态度，这是对群众公共利益不负责任，应该受到严厉批评。
    私立万生医院水缸里长满孑孓，检查人员快去时，才临时打滴滴涕。私立民生医院空罐头盒里有很多孑孓，传染病医院、华北军区总医院都没有认真做预防工作。北宁助产学校、红十字医院的水缸里都长满孑孓。北京市工农速成中学在校门口和院子里贴了很多预防脑炎的标语，可是树洞一个也没有堵；盆、罐里的孑孓也没有清除。市立男六中有四个树洞没有堵，女一中宿舍水缸中有孑孓。一区私营永兴化学工厂，区卫生委员督促了几次也不做。俄文专修学校、中国人民银行干部学校都有树洞没有堵。这些单位应该立即行动起来，做好预防脑炎的工作。
