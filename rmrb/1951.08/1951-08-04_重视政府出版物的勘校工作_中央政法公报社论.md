Editor's Note: The phenomenon of neglecting proofreading in publications exists not only in private publishing houses, but also in the publishing departments of some government agencies. The chaotic situation in the proofreading work of local political gazettes illustrates this point. The reason for this phenomenon is mainly that editors, proofreaders, and even leading comrades have not yet recognized the importance of this work ideologically. They treat their work with an extremely unserious attitude, thus causing serious errors. In order to draw everyone's attention to the work of proofreading, we have reprinted the editorial of the Central Political and Legal Gazette here.

Recently, we only checked two documents published in local political gazettes: the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" and the report by Peng Zhen, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the State Council, to the Central People's Government Committee, "On the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Activities and the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionary Regulations," and found many errors that should not have occurred in proofreading. We believe this is a problem worth reminding everyone to pay attention to.

In the 37 types of local people's government-issued political gazettes that published the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," we found a total of 165 errors of varying degrees that did not match the original text. In the 34 types of political gazettes that published Deputy Director Peng Zhen's "Report on the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Activities and the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionary Regulations," we found a total of 498 errors of varying degrees that did not match the original text, averaging about 15 errors per article. These errors include misprints, omissions, inversions, and confusion of paragraphs and punctuation marks. Particularly serious is the complete alteration of the original meaning of sentences. The following examples show the severity of the errors.

In the 12th issue of the Ningxia Political Gazette, the phrase "life imprisonment" was omitted from the sentencing provision of "ten years or more imprisonment, life imprisonment, or death penalty" in Article 13 of the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries." In the first issue of Volume 3 of the Shanghai Municipal Gazette, the phrase "or life imprisonment" was omitted from the provision in Article 9 of the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" that "those who plot or execute one of the following acts of sabotage or homicide shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment." In the third issue of Volume 2 of the Shaanxi Political Gazette and the seventh and eighth issues of Volume 2 of the Shandong Political Gazette, "ten years or less imprisonment" in Article 4 of the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" was incorrectly printed as "ten years or more imprisonment." In the third issue of Volume 2 of the Southern Anhui Political Gazette, "ten years or less imprisonment" in Article 13 of the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" was incorrectly printed as "ten years or more imprisonment." In the third issue of Volume 2 of the Northern Jiangsu Political Gazette, "plot or execute..." in Article 9 of the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" was incorrectly printed as "plot and execute..."; "those who sincerely repent and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes" in item 2 of Article 14 was incorrectly printed as "those who voluntarily repent and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes"; and "all or part of their property may be confiscated" in Article 17, the word "part" was incorrectly printed as "most." At the same time, in Deputy Director Peng Zhen's report, the important sentence "The severity of the sentence for offenders should be based on the magnitude of their crimes. If their crimes warrant the death penalty, they should be resolutely executed; if their crimes do not warrant the death penalty, they should not be executed. For those who fall between the category of being able to be killed and not being able to be killed, they should also not be killed, only those who deserve to be killed and must be killed, important counter-revolutionaries with solid evidence" omitted the crucial phrases "If their crimes warrant the death penalty, they should be resolutely executed" and "they should also not be killed."

In addition, there are many errors caused by careless proofreading, or they are also serious and should not have occurred. Even a punctuation mark will not be listed in detail. Here, such questions arise:

First, the state's policies and laws, especially such important policies and laws, are published on the important pages of our government's political gazettes. What a serious issue this is! What a serious attitude should be held by the editors, publishers, and government departments in charge of political gazettes? We can imagine even more situations of misrepresentation and passing on errors with such a careless printing mistake. However, the problem is that we have checked many of these political gazettes and have not seen any corrections afterward. We believe that the government's leadership over this kind of political gazette is so laissez-faire and should not be.

Second, some of the errors mentioned above are obviously not simply errors caused by negligent proofreading. What deserves serious attention is that errors such as omitting the four words "life imprisonment" and incorrectly printing the sentencing "ten years or less" as "ten years or more," and confiscating "part" of the property as "most," etc., are modifications of the policy. What caused these errors deserves in-depth investigation!

Third, from this, it can be seen that many comrades regard the so-called proofreading work as an unimportant technical work, and therefore entrust it to some personnel who have no sense of responsibility for their work. This is an incorrect view. It is even more wrong for proofreaders themselves to be unable to fulfill their duties.

Therefore, we hope that the people's governments of all localities will attach importance to this issue and conduct a careful check on the political gazettes they issue. At the same time, we hope that all newspaper and magazine proofreaders will highly develop their sense of responsibility for their work and make ensuring error-free proofreading one of their patriotic pledges.

　　重视政府出版物的勘校工作
    —中央政法公报社论—
    编者按：忽视出版物勘校工作的现象，不仅存在于私营出版社，亦同样存在于某些政府机关的出版部门。各地政报在勘校工作上的紊乱现象便说明了这一点。产生这种现象的原因，主要是由于编者、勘校者以至负责领导工作的同志，还没有从思想上认识到这一工作的重要性，他们用极不严肃的态度来对待自己的工作，因此发生了严重的错误。为了引起大家对勘校工作的重视，我们在这里转载了中央政法公报的社论。
    最近我们仅仅检查了各地政报所刊载的《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》和政务院政治法律委员会彭真副主任向中央人民政府委员会《关于镇压反革命活动和惩治反革命条例问题的报告》两个文件，就发现很多的属于勘校工作上的不应有的错误。我们认为这是值得提醒大家注意的一个问题。
    我们在各地人民政府发行的三十七种政报所刊载的《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》中，共发现与原文不符的大小错误有一百六十五处；而在三十四种政报所刊载的彭真副主任《关于镇压反革命活动和惩治反革命条例问题的报告》中，则共发现与原文不符的大小错误有四百九十八处，平均每篇有错误约十五处之多。这些错误，包括错字、遗漏、倒置、段落和标点符号混乱等的错误；特别严重的，是竟有将原来语句精神完全改变了的。从以下几个例子，可以看到错误的严重程度。
    宁夏政报第十二期上，把《惩治反革命条例》第十三条中的“处十年以上徒刑、无期徒刑或死刑”的量刑规定中，漏掉了“无期徒刑”四字。上海市政公报三卷一期上，把《惩治反革命条例》第九条“策谋或执行下列破坏、杀害行为之一者处死刑或无期徒刑”的规定中，漏掉了“或无期徒刑”五字。陕西政报二卷三期、山东政报二卷七、八期上，均把“惩治反革命条例”第四条中的“处十年以下徒刑”错为“处十年以上徒刑”。皖南政报二卷三期上，把《惩治反革命条例》第十三条中的“处十年以下徒刑”错为“十年以上徒刑”。苏北政报二卷三期上，把《惩治反革命条例》第九条中的“策谋或执行……”错为“策谋与执行……”；将第十四条第二项中的“真诚悔过立功赎罪者”错为“自愿悔过立功赎罪者”；将第十七条中的“并得没收其财产之全部或一部”的“一部”二字错为“大部”二字。同时将彭真副主任报告中“对于罪犯判刑的轻重，应根据其罪恶的大小。如果其罪该杀，即应坚决处刑；如果罪不该杀，即应不杀。对于介乎可杀可不杀之间者，也不要杀，只杀那些该杀和必须杀的人，有确实证据的重要反革命分子。”一段很重要的话，漏掉了“如果其罪该杀，即应坚决处刑”和“也不要杀”两句紧要的话。
    此外，还有许多属于勘校工作马虎造成的错误，或者也是较严重的不应有的错误，那怕是一个标点符号，都不详举例了。这里，就发生这样的问题：
    第一，国家的政策法令，特别是如像这样重要的政策法令，刊载在我们政府的政报重要版面上，这是何等严重的问题，不论政报的编者、发行者、和政府主管部门应持有的何等的严肃态度？如此漫不经心地印错了，以讹传讹的情况我们设想即更多了。然而问题还在于我们检查其中的不少政报，事后并未见有更正，政府对这种政报的领导如此自流放任，我们认为不应该的。
    第二，上述举例那些错误，显然有些似乎不简单是因勘校工作疏忽而发生的错误问题。值得严重注意的，就是如漏掉“无期徒刑”四字及把量刑“十年以下”错为“十年以上”、没收财产“一部”错为“大部”等等，如此修改了政策，究是因何造成这些错误，值得深入检查！
    第三，由此可知所谓勘校工作问题，不少同志把它简单地看做是一种不重要的技术工作，因而委之于一些毫无工作责任心的人员来做，这是不正确的观点；勘校工作者自己如此不能尽职，更是不应该的。
    为此，我们希望各地人民政府对自己发行的政报都能重视这个问题，认真地作一次检查。同时，我们希望一切报刊的勘校工作者，高度发挥自己对工作的负责性，把保证勘校无错误订为自己爱国公约之一。
