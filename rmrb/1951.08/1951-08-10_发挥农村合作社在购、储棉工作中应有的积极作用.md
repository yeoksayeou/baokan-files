In the work of purchasing and storing cotton, cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas have played a significant role. In the cotton purchasing and storage organizations at all levels in cotton-producing provinces such as Hebei and Pingyuan, cooperatives are one of the main components. At the beginning of the movement, many cooperatives in various regions convened member representative meetings and member group meetings to mobilize members to sell and store cotton, and cooperated with relevant departments to select key cooperatives to carry out cotton purchasing and storage demonstration work. These have played a role in promoting the sale and storage of cotton. The Datuan District Cooperative in Nanhui County, Southern Jiangsu, even challenged its brother cooperatives to a competition. As a result, 13,000 members throughout the district sold and stored 266,000 catties of seed cotton within twenty days, exceeding the original purchase target by more than 30%. Due to the promotion of the Datuan District Cooperative, grassroots cooperatives in Nanhui County launched cotton purchasing and storage work, collecting 700,000 catties of cotton in twenty days. The Beiqiao Township Cooperative in Shanghai County, under the leadership of the local Party committee, government, and higher-level cooperatives, purchased 11,000 catties of seed cotton in seven days, more than twice the estimated amount. Under the impetus of Beiqiao Township, Dashu and Yuji townships in the county also sold and stored more than 20,000 catties of seed cotton. Many other cooperatives in various places have played such a role.

However, in the work of purchasing and storing cotton, cooperatives have also made some mistakes and shortcomings. The main ones are the following two:

First, some cooperatives lacked a correct understanding of the work of purchasing and storing cotton, and did not actively and proactively carry out this work, or simply gave up when they encountered some difficulties. Cooperatives in Longyao and Julu counties in Hebei, for example, had not signed cotton purchasing contracts by mid-July due to their inability to reach an agreement with the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company on the issue of agency fees, or because they were afraid of losing money. The Changhe and Yiwu Cooperatives in Yuyao County, Zhejiang, believed that the work of purchasing and storing cotton was the business of the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company and had little to do with the cooperatives. Cooperatives in Jinxi and Suizhong in Liaoxi Province did not establish agency relationships with cotton ginning mills, adopting a passive attitude of "collecting cotton when it is sold." During the cotton purchasing and storage movement, the Changzhi Special District Cooperative in Shanxi even sent personnel to Yuncheng to purchase cotton needed for members' consumption. The director of the Nanpo Cooperative in Xiuwu County, Pingyuan Province, was unaware of the cotton purchasing task in late June and was pushing cotton for sale outside. Some cadres of the cooperative in Shanzhou, Henan Province, who were cooperating with the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company in purchasing cotton, requested to be transferred back to the cooperative in mid-July. They lacked understanding and enthusiasm for this political task.

Some cooperatives, when encountering difficulties in grading techniques, did not actively try to find solutions, but passively relaxed the work of purchasing and storing cotton. This is a relatively common phenomenon. Several cooperatives in the Nantong Special District of Northern Jiangsu dared not boldly purchase cotton because they were downgraded when handing over cotton due to improper grading. In addition, some cooperatives believed that they could not purchase cotton without wheat, and did not actively think of other solutions.

Second, the work of purchasing and storing cotton could not be combined with other businesses of the cooperative, which affected the development of cotton purchasing work. The Shanxi Provincial Cooperative General Society instructed the cooperatives in cotton-producing areas of the province to have all members of the community construction team participate in the cotton purchasing and storage work. However, the Yuncheng Special District Cooperative in the province refused to implement this, believing that it would hinder community construction. Some county cooperatives in the Xingtai Special District of Hebei emphasized that "the current focus should be on tightening up the collection of loans and promoting the sale of fertilizers, red sorghum, and advance purchase of cotton," and did not promptly implement the cotton purchasing and storage work at the grassroots cooperatives. Several district cooperatives in Pingyuan County, Shandong, were also simply busy with other work and abandoned cotton purchasing work. Some responsible cadres of the cooperatives ran to the countryside to simply build communities, while others concentrated their efforts on selling finished products. The Beizhen County Cooperative in Liaoxi Province also emphasized that it was currently pre-purchasing kenaf and did not actively participate in the cotton purchasing and storage work.

Based on the above situation, how should cooperatives play a role in purchasing and storing cotton?

First, at present, with the development of cotton purchasing and storage work in various cotton-producing areas, the quantity and types of materials needed have increased. Therefore, cooperatives should vigorously develop the work of supplying materials to meet the needs of cotton-selling members. In carrying out this work, in addition to actively seeking the assistance of state-owned trading departments, cooperatives should also organize funds and plan to purchase large quantities of materials needed by cotton farmers to make up for the insufficient supply of state-owned trading departments. When the cooperative's own supply capacity is insufficient, it can also adopt a trust business method to accept the entrustment of members and cotton farmers to purchase the required materials on their behalf. This method of combining supply and sales has been implemented in some areas. Cotton collection stations of cooperatives in Changli, Fengnan, Funing and other counties in Tangshan Special District, Hebei Province, sell fertilizer on behalf of local products companies; Enxian, Dingxian and other cooperatives exchange soybean cakes for cotton from cotton farmers; and some cooperatives combine cotton purchasing with the supply of grain, salt, coal, etc. Cooperatives in Anguo, Shenze and other counties in Hebei Province brought industrial products to the countryside to exchange for cotton, which achieved great results and was warmly welcomed by the masses of cotton farmers. The Anyang County Cooperative in Pingyuan Province joined forces with the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company to form a mobile team to go deep into the cotton-producing areas, combining political mobilization with material supply, so that the cotton purchasing work could be carried out rapidly. The Weijiaqiao Cooperative in Shen County, Hebei Province, increased the amount of cotton purchased by bringing goods to the countryside by one time compared to simply waiting for purchases. The Dadi Village Cooperative in the county used to collect only a hundred catties of cotton per market day, but after bringing goods to the countryside, it collected more than 4,000 catties in one day.

Second, we should actively find ways to overcome the weakness of inaccurate grading. To solve the difficulty of lacking technical personnel, in addition to sending business personnel to the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company to learn, there are two other methods worth promoting. One is to hire local experienced cotton farmer representatives with good reputation and impartiality among the masses to participate in the grading work. The other is to cooperate with the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company to organize more cotton collection stations, with the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company responsible for the grading work and the cooperative responsible for other technical work. This division of labor and cooperation can not only solve the difficulty of grading by the cooperative, but also simplify the procedures for the cooperative to hand over cotton to the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company, and can avoid the cooperative and the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company competing for the market with each other.

Third, it is necessary to closely combine with other businesses of the cooperative. In carrying out the cotton purchasing and storage work, the Fengfeng Mining Area Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei actively supplied crude oil residue, black soap, tobacco leaves, etc., based on the urgent needs of members and cotton farmers and the elimination of aphids. Because the cooperative met the needs of members and cotton farmers, coupled with in-depth publicity and mobilization, it purchased more than 193,000 catties of seed cotton in one month, more than doubling the original task. The cotton purchasing and storage work in Zhangzhuang Township, Wuqiao, Shandong, was carried out in conjunction with the advance purchase of cotton, and as a result, both tasks achieved good results.

Since the beginning of August, the insect plague in major cotton-producing areas has been reduced, and they have concentrated their efforts on carrying out cotton purchasing and storage work. Everyone is determined to make a final effort to strive for greater achievements in cotton purchasing and storage. It is hoped that cooperatives in various places will become more active and give full play to their due role in cotton purchasing and storage.

### 发挥农村合作社在购、储棉工作中应有的积极作用

　　发挥农村合作社在购、储棉工作中应有的积极作用
    近宇
    在购棉储棉工作中，各棉产区合作社起了很大作用。河北、平原等省产棉区的各级购棉储棉机构中，合作社是主要组成部分之一。许多地区的合作社在运动之初，即召开了社员代表大会、社员小组会，进行了售棉储棉的动员，并配合各有关部门，选择重点合作社，进行购棉储棉示范工作。这些对售储棉运动都起了推动作用。苏南南汇县大团区合作社并向各兄弟社提出挑战竞赛，结果全区一万三千个社员在二十天内售、储籽棉二十六万六千斤，超过原定收购任务的百分之三十以上。由于大团区合作社的推动，南汇县基层合作社都开展了购棉储棉工作，在二十天内收棉七十万斤。上海县北桥乡合作社在当地党委、政府和上级社领导下，七天内收购籽棉一万一千斤，超过估计数量的二倍。在北桥乡的推动下，该县大树、俞箕两乡也售储籽棉二万多斤。其他各地很多合作社都起了这样的作用。
    但是，在购棉储棉工作中，合作社也曾发生一些错误和缺点。其中主要的有以下两种：
    第一、是部分合作社对购棉储棉工作缺乏正确的认识，没有积极、主动地进行这一工作，或者在碰到一点困难时就不干了。河北隆尧、巨鹿等县合作社，由于在代购手续费问题上不能与花纱布公司取得协议，或是怕赔钱，一直到七月中旬还没有签订代购棉花合同。浙江余姚县长河、义五合作社，则认为购棉储棉工作是花纱布公司的事情，与合作社关系不大。辽西省锦西、绥中等地合作社不和轧花厂建立代购关系，抱着“来卖就收”的消极态度。山西长治专区合作社在购棉储棉运动期间，竟派员到运城为社员收购消费所需的棉花。平原省修武县南坡合作社主任在六月下旬还不知道有购棉任务，而挑着棉花向外推销。河南省陕州合作社配合花纱布公司购棉的干部，在七月中旬就有要求调回合作社去的。他们对这一政治任务缺乏认识，也缺乏热情。
    有些合作社在分级技术发生困难时，不是积极想办法解决，而是消极地放松购棉储棉工作。这是一种比较普遍的现象。苏北南通专区若干合作社因分级不妥，在交花时遭受压级，就不敢大胆收购了。此外，还有的合作社认为没有麦子就不能购棉，不去积极想另外的办法。
    第二，不能把购棉储棉工作与合作社的其他业务结合起来，因而影响了购棉工作的开展。山西省合作总社曾指示该省产棉区合作社建社大队全体人员参加购棉储棉工作。但该省运城专区合作社却认为妨碍建社，拒绝执行。河北邢台专区若干县合作社则强调“目前主要应抓紧收贷和推销肥料、红粮及预购棉花工作”，没有把购棉储棉工作及时贯彻到基层社。山东平原县若干区合作社也是单纯忙于其他工作，放弃了购棉工作，有些社的负责干部跑到乡里去单纯建社，有些社集中力量推销成品。辽西省北镇县合作社也是强调正在预购洋麻，不积极参加购棉储棉工作。
    根据以上情况，合作社应该怎样在购棉储棉中发挥作用呢？
    第一、目前各产棉区随着购棉储棉工作的开展，需要物资的数量与种类都增加了，因此合作社应该大力开展物资供应工作，来满足卖棉的社员的要求。在开展这一工作中，除主动取得国营贸易部门的协助外，合作社还应该组织资金，有计划地大量采购棉农所需物资，以弥补国营贸易部门供应的不足。在合作社本身供应能力不足时，也可以采用信托业务方式，接受社员和棉农的委托，代购所需物资。这种有供有销、供销结合的作法，若干地区已在实行。河北唐山专区的昌黎、丰南、抚宁等县合作社的收棉站代土产公司出售肥田粉；恩县、定县等合作社用豆饼向棉农换购棉花；还有的合作社结合购棉，供应粮食、食盐、煤炭等。河北省安国、深泽等县合作社带工业品下乡，换购棉花，曾取得很大的成绩，并受到棉农群众热烈欢迎，平原安阳县合作社与花纱布公司合组流动小组深入棉区，把政治动员与物资供应结合起来，购棉工作因而得以迅速开展。河北深县魏家桥合作社带货下乡，比单纯坐等收购的数量增加一倍。该县大堤村合作社以前每集只收棉一百多斤，带货下乡后一天就收购了四千多斤。
    第二、应该积极想办法克服分级不准确的弱点。为解决缺乏技术人员的困难，除派遣业务人员向花纱布公司学习外，还有两个办法值得推广。一个是聘请当地有经验同时在群众中有声誉的、为人公正的棉农代表参加分级工作。另一个是配合花纱布公司多组织收棉站，由花纱布公司负责分级工作，合作社负担其他技术工作。这样分工合作，不仅可以解决合作社分级的困难，还可以简化合作社向花纱布公司交花的手续，并可以避免合作社和花纱布公司互争市场。
    第三、要密切结合合作社的其他业务。河北峰峰矿区供销合作社在进行购棉储棉工作中，曾根据社员棉农的迫切要求及除蚜的情况，主动供应黑油渣、黑肥皂、烟叶等。由于该社满足了社员棉农的需要，再加上深入的宣传动员，一个月即收购籽棉十九万三千余斤，超过原任务一倍以上。山东吴桥张庄乡的购棉储棉工作，与预购棉花工作结合进行，结果，两项工作都获得很好的成绩。
    八月初以来，各主要产棉区虫灾已见减轻，纷纷集中力量，进行购棉储棉工作。大家决心经过最后的努力，争取购棉储棉的更大成绩，希望各地合作社更加积极起来，充分发挥在购棉储棉中应有的作用。
