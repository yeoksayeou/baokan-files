    Beijing Municipal People's Government Letter Explains:
    Reinstatement of Workers at Beiyang Paper Mill Resolved
To the Editors:
    Regarding the issue of layoffs at the privately-owned Beiyang Paper Mill in Beijing, which was published in the People's Daily on April 23rd, our bureau has investigated and handled the matter. The factual details are as follows:

    Beiyang Paper Mill officially ceased operations on April 17, 1950, due to sluggish sales and financial difficulties. At that time, in order to overcome the difficulties, the workers proactively consulted with the management, and both parties agreed to reduce wages by 50% for three months, from the beginning of May to the end of July. After the agreement period expired, the factory was still unable to resume operations. Therefore, labor and management consulted again on August 1st. After eight meetings, no agreement was reached. The management finally proposed to keep four workers to guard the factory, and all other twenty-eight workers would be laid off. Based on the actual situation at the time, where the factory genuinely lacked the ability to operate, the workers discussed and agreed to the above proposal. Our bureau, along with the Industry Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Twelfth District Trade Union Office, jointly discussed the matter, and everyone also agreed with the above approach. Regarding the severance pay issue, after several consultations between the two parties and several mediations by our bureau proved ineffective, the matter was finally submitted to the Arbitration Committee, which ruled that the management should pay each person one and a half months' salary as severance pay.

    In November 1950, the factory then sought to resume operations. They first sold a machine and used the funds for the resumption of work (starting with one shift). At that time, fifteen direct production workers were needed. In addition to transferring eight workers from the Hebei General Factory, the management selected seven from the laid-off workers. The representatives of the laid-off workers, in order to take care of the factory's resumption of operations, also agreed to this approach. It was also agreed that in the future, if the factory switched to two or three shifts, the originally laid-off workers would have the right to be reinstated with priority; before all the originally laid-off workers were reinstated, the management could not transfer workers from other places. This year, in March, the factory management violated the previous agreement and transferred another worker from the Tianjin Hebei General Factory, and also hired four temporary workers. They switched to two shifts starting from February 25th of this year, and planned to hire more workers in May to switch to three shifts. The laid-off workers who had not been reinstated learned of the above situation and immediately sent representatives to negotiate with the factory management, demanding full reinstatement, and reported the matter to our bureau. Our bureau criticized the factory management for violating the agreement and obstructing the reinstatement of workers. As a result, the management agreed to reinstate seven more workers. After the second batch of reinstatement issues was resolved, the workers' representatives believed that the conditions for the factory to work three shifts were in place, and that all laid-off workers should be reinstated. After listening to the workers' request for full reinstatement, our bureau immediately conducted an in-depth investigation and study, agreed with the workers' opinion, and prepared to request the factory management to accept all workers for reinstatement. At this point, the People's Daily published a criticism of the factory management for not fulfilling the reinstatement agreement. Our bureau immediately continued to discuss with the factory manager based on the criticism in the newspaper. As a result, the factory stated that it agreed to reinstate all laid-off workers, and the matter was concluded.

    Bai Xiusheng, the agent (manager) of the Beiyang Paper Mill, repeatedly violated the reinstatement agreement signed by the labor and management of the factory. His wrong attitude towards the workers was not accidental. Before liberation, if a worker was "wrong" in the slightest, he would use large-character posters to announce the expulsion of the worker, even saying that the worker was suspected of "secretly colluding with bandits" (referring to the Communist Party) to intimidate progressive workers. After liberation, when the factory laid off workers last year, a dispute arose with the workers. After arbitration, the management mistakenly believed that it had won, and took the opportunity to attack the trade union cadres, attempting to sow discord between the trade union and the government. During the reinstatement process, they obstructed the former laid-off trade union cadres and activists from returning to work. After this criticism, the factory management's erroneous thinking and behavior have now begun to show some understanding and improvement.

    In handling the Beiyang Paper Mill layoff issue, we conducted joint research based on the specific circumstances of the factory at that time and with relevant parties. This handling was still cautious and reasonable. However, our inspection of the factory's resumption of operations was indeed inadequate. It was not until the second batch of reinstatements that we discovered the fact that the management had violated the agreement, which shows that there is still a bureaucratic style in our work that is not responsible enough to the workers. Secondly, we did not pay attention to the reinstatement of trade union cadres, which shows that our understanding of the trade union is insufficient, and we objectively accommodated the management. This is something that should be paid special attention to in future work.

### 北京市人民政府来信说明  北洋造纸厂工人复工问题已经得到解决

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市人民政府来信说明
    北洋造纸厂工人复工问题已经得到解决编辑同志：
    人民日报于四月二十三日刊载北京市私营北洋造纸厂解雇工人问题，业经我局调查处理，现将经过事实说明如下：
    北洋造纸厂一九五○年四月十七日起，因产品滞销，资金周转困难，正式停工。当时为了度过难关，工人主动和资方进行协商，双方同意自五月初至七月底三个月，降低工资百分之五十。协议期满后该厂仍无法开工，于是劳资双方又于八月一日再次进行协商，经过八次会议，协商仍无结果，资方最后提出留四名工人看厂外，其余二十八名工人一律解雇，根据当时该厂确无开工能力的实际情况，经工人讨论研究，同意了以上提议。我局和工业局以及市总工会、十二区工会办事处等单位共同商讨的结果，大家也同意以上办法。遣散费的问题，当时经过双方数次协商和我局数次调解均无效，最后经提交仲裁委员会裁定由资方发给每人一个半月的薪金为遣散费。
    一九五○年十一月，该厂即又设法开工。先出售了一部机器，即将此款用于复工（先开一班），当时需要十五名直接参加生产工人。资方除由河北总厂调来了八名工人外，另由被遣散的工人中选择了七名。被遣散工人代表，为照顾工厂开工起见，也就同意了这个办法。并约定今后工厂改为两班或三班，原被遣散的工人有优先复工的权利；在原被遣散工人未全部得到复工前，资方不得由他处调用工人。今年三月该厂资方不履行前约，由天津河北总厂又调来一个工人，并且还添雇了四个临时工，并于今年二月二十五日起改为两班，并准备另雇工人在五月份改为三班。被解雇未得复工的工人知道了以上情况，即推派代表与该厂资方交涉，要求全部复工，并将此事报告了我局。我局对该厂资方违犯协议，阻拦工人复工的作法，曾给予批评，结果资方又答应再接受七个工人复工。第二批复工问题解决后，工人代表认为该厂三班工作的条件已具备，被解雇的工人应全部复工。我局听取了工人要求全部复工的意见后，当即作了深入的调查研究，同意了工人的意见，并准备要求该厂资方接受全部工人复工。即在此时，人民日报登出了对该厂资方不履行复工协议的批评，我局即根据报上的批评与该厂经理继续进行商谈，结果厂方表示同意被解雇工人全部复工，此事即告结束。
    北洋造纸厂资方代理人（经理）白秀生，几次违反该厂劳资双方订立的复工协议，其对工人的错误态度并不是偶然的。在解放前，工人有一点“不对”，他就用大字通告，开除工人，甚至说工人有“暗通奸匪”（指共产党）嫌疑，来威吓进步工人。解放后，当去年该厂遣散工人时，与工人发生争执，经仲裁后，资方竟错误地认为自己胜利了，就趁机打击工会干部，企图挑拨工会与政府之间的关系。在复工过程中，并阻拦原被遣散的工会干部及积极分子回厂工作。北洋造纸厂资方代理人这种错误的思想行为，经过这次批评后，现已有了初步的认识和改进。
    在处理北洋造纸厂解雇问题上，我们是根据了当时该厂具体情况并和有关方面进行了共同的研究的，这样的处理还是慎重合理的。但是我们对于该厂的复工问题，检查确是不够的，直到第二批复工时，才发现资方违反协议的事实，这说明我们的工作中还存在着对工人不够负责的官僚主义作风。其次，没有注意到工会干部的复工问题，这就说明我们对工会的认识不足，客观上迁就了资方，这是今后工作中应特别注意的。
