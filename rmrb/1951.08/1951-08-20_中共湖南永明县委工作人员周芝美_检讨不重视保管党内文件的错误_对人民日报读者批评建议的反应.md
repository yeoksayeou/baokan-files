Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

　　Zhou Zhibei, Staff Member of the Yongming County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province

    Self-Criticism for Neglecting the Proper Storage of Internal Party Documents

    To the Editorial Comrades:

    I sincerely accept the letter from Comrade Zhang Miansheng and others, published in the People's Daily on July 13th, criticizing my lack of attention to the proper storage of internal Party documents. The occurrence of this matter is due to my own ideological numbness and carelessness, as I believed it was acceptable to leave the documents in the home of a poor peasant. Therefore, when I left, I did not instruct other comrades to take over the safekeeping. This fully demonstrates my lack of a clear understanding of the importance of maintaining secrecy. If this continues to develop, it will lead to very serious consequences. After this criticism, I will definitely heighten my vigilance in the future.

                              Zhou Zhibei
                              Yongming County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

　　中共湖南永明县委工作人员周芝美
    检讨不重视保管党内文件的错误编辑同志：
    七月十三日人民日报发表了张绵盛等同志批评我不注意保管党内文件的信，我诚恳接受这一批评。这件事情的发生是因为我自己思想麻痹大意，认为把文件放在一家贫农家里没有关系。因此，在自己离开时，也没有交待别的同志代为保管。这充分表现我对保守机密的重要认识不清，这样发展下去，将会造成很严重的后果。经过这次批评，今后一定提高警惕。
