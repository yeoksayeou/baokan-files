Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd:

　　The American ruling clique, in order to completely monopolize the markets of its vassal states, is attempting to force Western European countries to sacrifice their own vital interests and cease trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic countries. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a so-called "Battle Act" earlier this month, stipulating that military and economic "aid" be prohibited to countries that export what the U.S. government considers "strategic materials" to the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries. This bill even attempts to restrict the export of all goods outside of "strategic materials," stipulating that any country that refuses to "effectively cooperate" and fails to notify the United States of the supply situation of goods outside the scope directly prohibited by the bill will have its aid suspended.

　　The overbearing policy adopted by the United States has first and foremost severely damaged the interests of its top partner, Great Britain, because if Great Britain does not export goods to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, it will actually be unable to exchange for the grain necessary for the lives of the British people and the raw materials necessary for the survival of British industry. Faced with this vicious threat, British Trade Minister Stokes had to give a speech on the 15th, openly stating that he "rejected the American demand to ban trade with communist countries and attacked the Americans who wanted to order Britain to trade with whom" (Associated Press).

　　Stokes elaborated on Britain's difficult situation, saying that because the sterling area's dollar deficit is deteriorating, in order to avoid financial difficulties, it can no longer increase imports from the dollar area and must obtain grain, timber, and other products from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Taking last year as an example, Britain "imported 690,000 tons of coarse grains from the Soviet bloc, accounting for more than one-third of Britain's total coarse grain imports, and our imports of softwood account for nearly one-quarter of total imports. Cured meat imports account for one-tenth of total imports... These materials are absolutely indispensable to us." Therefore, "while we will certainly not do anything to increase the relative strength of potential enemies, it would be foolish for us to restrict our trade and weaken our own strategic and economic position." Stokes said: "I ask our American friends to recognize that depriving Eastern and Western Europe of each other's resources will not eliminate communism, but will only hinder the economic welfare of both sides, and neither side will gain a relative advantage."

　　The commentator Marinin of the Truth newspaper once pointed out regarding the United States' consistent policy of sabotaging trade between Eastern and Western Europe: Destroying normal economic relations in the world is part of the aggressive policy of American monopoly capitalists, and its purpose is to prepare for a new world war of aggression. This policy greatly increases the difficulties of Great Britain and other Western European countries, whose economic situation is deteriorating.

### 美国强力破坏东西欧贸易  英经济遭受严重打击

　　美国强力破坏东西欧贸易
    英经济遭受严重打击
    【新华社二十二日讯】美国统治集团，为了完全独占其附庸国家的市场，正力图迫使西欧各国牺牲它们切身的利益，停止与苏联及东欧人民民主国家进行贸易。美国众议院于本月初通过了一项所谓“巴特尔法案”，规定禁止以军事和经济“援助”给予那些向苏联及人民民主国家输出照美国政府认为是“战略物资”的国家。这个法案甚至企图限制在“战略物资”以外的所有货物的输出，它规定：任何一国，凡有拒绝“有效合作”，不把关于在该法案所直接禁止的范围以外的货物供应情况通知美国的情事发生，即停止予以援助。
    美国所采取的这种横行霸道的政策，首先严重地打击了它的头号伙计英国的利益，因为英国如果不向苏联与人民民主国家输出货物，实际上就将无法换取英国人民生活所必需的粮食与英国工业生存所必需的原料。在这种凶恶的威胁面前，英国贸易大臣萧克劳斯不得不于十五日发表演说，公然表示“拒绝美国关于禁绝与共产党国家贸易的要求，并攻击那些想要命令英国与谁贸易的美国人”（合众社）。
    萧克劳斯申述英国的困难处境说：由于英镑区的美元赤字正在恶化，为了避免财政上的困难，它不能再增加来自美元区的进口货，它必须自苏联与东欧取得谷物、木材及其他产品。以去年为例，英国“从苏联集团输入六十九万吨粗粮，占英国粗粮全部进口的三分之一以上，我们输入的软性木材几占全部进口的四分之一。输入的腌肉占全部进口的十分之一。……这些物资是我们所决不能缺少的”。因此，“我们固然决不会作任何事来增加潜在的敌人的相对力量，但如果我们限制我们的贸易而削弱我们自己的战略和经济地位，那我们却实在是愚蠢的。”萧克劳斯说：“我请求美国朋友们认清：使东欧与西欧失掉对方的资源，并不能消灭共产主义，而只能妨害双方的经济福利，使任何一方都得不到相对的利益。”
    真理报评论家马里宁曾经就美国一贯地破坏东西欧贸易的政策指出：破坏世界的正常经济关系，是美国垄断资本家侵略政策的一部分，其目的是要准备新的世界侵略战争。这种政策大大地增加了经济情况正在日益恶化中的英国及其他西欧国家的困难。
