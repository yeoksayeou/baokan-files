　　Further Promote the Patriotic Pact Movement
    Various Regions Inspect and Revise Patriotic Pacts
    [Our Newspaper] Currently, many regions are carrying out the work of inspecting and revising patriotic pacts. Hebei Province and Nanjing City universally inspected the implementation of patriotic pacts by various units in June and July. The northeastern provinces, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and many units in Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shandong, Zhejiang, Northern Anhui, Fujian, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Eastern Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, Northern Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Western Kang provinces and regions, as well as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Xi'an, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and other cities, have already or are in the process of inspecting and revising patriotic pacts. For example, major factories and enterprises in Beijing universally launched a movement to inspect and revise patriotic pacts in July. In Heilongjiang Province, five banners and counties, including Guo Hou Banner, have had 5,028 mutual aid teams combine the production increase and donation movement to inspect, revise, or begin formulating patriotic pacts.
    Many regions or units, through this movement of inspecting and revising patriotic pacts, affirmed the achievements of past patriotic pact work, promoted successful experiences, and also discovered serious tendencies of formalism in the movement. They adopted improved measures, enabling the patriotic pact movement to move forward.
    Experiences from various regions have proven that to do a good job in inspecting and revising patriotic pacts, it is first necessary to examine the guiding ideology and leadership style, so that cadres at all levels have a correct understanding of the patriotic pact movement. When the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted an in-depth inspection in June of the situation of workers in major factories and enterprises formulating and implementing patriotic pacts, it found that many workers, including leading cadres, still lacked sufficient understanding of the significance and role of patriotic pacts. They did not combine labor competitions, donations, and all central tasks with patriotic pacts. Many units carried out this work from a purely task-oriented viewpoint. Inspections of six units revealed that some branches had never studied the work of universally formulating patriotic pacts at Party meetings. Because leading cadres did not attach importance to this work, workers were not fully mobilized to deliberate and discuss when formulating patriotic pacts. The content of the pacts was either empty and general or cumbersome and trivial. After the pacts were formulated, they were not inspected, supplemented, or revised. As a result, patriotic pacts in many units were nominal and did not play their due role. In response to this situation, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately instructed Party organizations in various factories to earnestly study important documents on patriotic pacts, include patriotic pact work on the agenda of Party meetings, and mobilize the masses of workers through trade unions in July to universally inspect, revise, or formulate patriotic pacts. Party organizations in various factories generally held meetings to study relevant documents on patriotic pacts and focused on examining the thinking of cadres, which aroused everyone's attention to patriotic pacts. Most factories and mining enterprises have formulated specific plans for mobilizing workers to formulate, inspect, and revise patriotic pacts, starting with strengthening propaganda and education work and having leading organs deeply grasp typical groups to universally launch the movement to inspect and revise patriotic pacts. In this way, the inspection and revision of patriotic pacts can be carried out smoothly in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner. After mid-June, Longsheng County in Guangxi successively held enlarged cadre meetings and meetings of propagandists and reading group representatives at the county and district levels, focusing on inspecting and criticizing the bureaucratic and substitution style of work and formalistic tendencies in the formulation of patriotic pacts, discussing relevant work on patriotic pacts, mobilizing cadres and activists throughout the county to conduct propaganda and education to the masses, and universally launching the work of inspecting and revising patriotic pacts.
    Secondly, it is necessary to launch mass-based inspections. One of the roles of inspecting patriotic pacts is to educate the masses and cadres through inspection, so that they can further understand the political significance of patriotic pacts, so as to promote the patriotic pact movement to move forward. In this inspection, most regions paid attention to mobilizing the masses, but some regions simply adopted a top-down inspection method, and therefore did not receive the expected results. In some places in Xing'an League, Inner Mongolia, inspectors were sent to inspect the implementation of patriotic pacts. The masses, not understanding the significance of inspecting patriotic pacts, hurriedly found the patriotic pacts and posted them on the walls to cope with the "errand." When Yidu County, Shandong, recently universally inspected the implementation of patriotic pacts, seven districts, eleven townships, thirty villages, and thirty-four groups inspected patriotic pacts and adopted the method of mobilizing the masses for evaluation and inspection. That is, the village patriotic pact inspection committee first announced the key inspection items at the villagers' meeting, explaining the significance of the inspection, and then mobilized the masses to conduct evaluation and inspection in the form of self-reporting and public discussion by production team or neighborhood. During the inspection, the masses were very serious, conducting evaluation and comparison item by item and person by person, praising the good and criticizing the bad, thereby promoting the implementation of patriotic pacts. For example, one of the inspection items in Jiangjiaqiao Village was "the millet has been hoeed five times." Before the inspection, many households had not yet done so. However, after the inspection items were announced, the masses completed hoeing all the millet fields five times within two days.
    Third, attention should be paid to discovering good and bad examples of implementing patriotic pacts during the inspection, and appropriate praise and criticism should be given to encourage the masses to move forward. After universally inspecting the implementation of patriotic pacts by the industrial and commercial circles in Chengguan, Qinxian County, Shanxi Province, the Industry and Commerce Federation convened a conference attended by more than 200 industrialists and businessmen from the entire Chengguan, praising 12 people who actively implemented patriotic pacts and giving them the honorary title of "Model of Implementing Pacts." At the same time, it also criticized four industrialists and businessmen who violated patriotic pacts. In this way, everyone's enthusiasm for realizing patriotic pacts was greatly inspired. After the inspection, some people put forward specific conditions to other industrialists and businessmen to initiate competitions, guaranteeing the resolute implementation of patriotic pacts. However, some units only found a lot of shortcomings and problems in the inspection, without affirming achievements based on the actual situation, and finding typical examples of formulating and implementing patriotic pacts better, as a direction to guide everyone forward. In addition, some places discovered shortcomings but did not criticize or correct them, which would affect the enthusiasm of the masses, thus losing the role of inspection work.
    Fourth, supplement and revise patriotic pacts according to different situations, so that patriotic pacts always maintain rich content and always play a driving role in promoting work. Some units have completed certain regulations, and when revising the pacts, they put forward higher requirements. Some units, especially in rural areas, revised according to new situations after completing seasonal work. The patriotic pacts of some units were originally cumbersome, and they were revised to be concise and to the point; the empty ones were revised to be specific, and the conditions that were too high or too low were revised to be practical. When revising patriotic pacts, many units adopted the method of using typical examples to promote the general. For example, the chairman of the Tianjin Vehicle Factory Trade Union of the Tianjin Railway Bureau personally helped the Wang Decai Group, studied the group's situation, and added provisions to improve technology and establish a learning system, which played a demonstration role in the revision of patriotic pacts throughout the factory.
    After inspecting patriotic pacts, various regions have generally formulated regular inspection systems or established fixed inspection organizations to ensure the continuous promotion of the patriotic pact movement.
    As of now, some regions have not yet started inspecting the implementation of patriotic pacts; some regions have conducted inspections, but they are not very thorough. For example, the industrial and commercial circles in Kaifeng City only had the Federation of Industry and Commerce print and distribute inspection forms, and the chairmen or secretaries of the public associations in many industries filled them out casually according to the forms, perfunctorily, which did not play a role at all. This deserves the attention of various regions.

　　进一步推进爱国公约运动
    各地检查修订爱国公约
    【本报讯】目前已有许多地区进行检查、修订爱国公约的工作。河北省和南京市，在六、七月间已普遍检查了一次各单位执行爱国公约的情况；东北各省、内蒙古自治区和山西、察哈尔、绥远、山东、浙江、皖北、福建、苏南、苏北、陕西、甘肃、青海、河南、湖北、湖南、川东、川南、川西、川北、云南、贵州、西康等省区及北京、天津、上海、西安、武汉、广州、重庆等城市的许多单位，都已经或正在检查、修订爱国公约。例如北京市各大工厂企业，在七月份普遍展开了检查、修订爱国公约的运动。黑龙江省郭后旗等五个旗、县已有五千零二十八个互助组结合增产捐献运动，检查、修订或开始订立了爱国公约。
    许多地区或单位，通过这次检查修订爱国公约运动，肯定了过去推行爱国公约工作的成绩，推广了成功的经验，同时也发现了运动中严重的形式主义的偏向，采取了改进的措施，使爱国公约运动向前进了一步。
    各地的经验证明，要做好爱国公约的检查、修订工作，首先必须检查领导思想和领导作风，使各级工作干部对爱国公约运动都有正确的认识。中共北京市委员会在六月份深入检查各较大工厂企业职工订立与执行爱国公约的情况时，发现许多职工包括领导干部在内，还对爱国公约的意义和作用认识不足。他们没有把劳动竞赛、捐献以及一切中心工作与爱国公约相结合，不少单位是从单纯任务观点出发来进行这一工作的。从六个单位的检查中，发现有些支部从未在党的会议上研究过普遍订立爱国公约的工作。由于领导干部不重视这一工作，订立爱国公约时未发动职工充分酝酿讨论，公约的内容或则空泛，或则繁琐；订约以后又未检查与补充修正，因之许多单位的爱国公约有名无实，未发挥应有的作用。针对这种情况，中共北京市委员会即指示各厂党的组织，认真学习关于爱国公约的重要文件，将爱国公约工作列入党的会议议程，并在七月份内通过工会发动职工群众，普遍检查修订或订立爱国公约。各厂党的组织一般都召开了会议，研究了有关爱国公约的文件，并着重检查了干部思想，引起了大家对爱国公约的重视，大部分厂矿单位都制订了关于发动职工订立、检查与修订爱国公约的具体计划，从加强宣传教育工作着手，并由领导机关深入掌握典型小组，以普遍发动检查修订爱国公约的运动。这样，就使爱国公约的检查、修订工作得以有计划、有步骤、有中心地顺利开展。广西龙胜县在六月中旬以后，县、区先后召开了扩大干部会议和宣传员、读报组代表会议，着重检查批判了在订立爱国公约中的包办代替作风和形式主义倾向，讨论了有关爱国公约的工作，发动全县干部与积极分子向群众进行宣传教育，普遍开展了检查修订爱国公约的工作。
    其次，必须发动群众性的检查。检查爱国公约的作用之一，是要通过检查，对群众和干部进行教育，使其进一步认识爱国公约的政治意义，以推动爱国公约运动向前发展。在此次检查中，大部分地区注意了发动群众，但有些地区却单纯地采用了自上而下的检查方法，因而未收到预期的效果。内蒙兴安盟有的地方派检查员检查爱国公约推行情况，群众因未了解检查爱国公约的意义，慌忙找出爱国公约，贴在墙上，应付“差事”。山东益都县最近在普遍检查爱国公约的执行情况时，有七个区、十一个乡、三十个村、三十四个小组检查了爱国公约，并采取了发动群众评比检查的办法。即先由村爱国公约检查委员会把着重检查的项目在村民大会上公布，说明检查的意义，然后发动群众以生产小组或以闾为单位，用自报公议的方式进行评比检查。在检查中，群众非常认真，逐条逐人地进行了评议与对比，表扬了好的，批评了坏的，进而推动了爱国公约的执行。例如蒋家桥村的检查项目中有一条是“谷子锄完五遍”。检查以前，许多户还未做到。但检查项目公布后，群众在两天内便将谷地全部锄完五遍。
    第三，检查中应注意发现执行爱国公约的好坏典型，予以适当的表扬和批评，以鼓励群众前进。山西省沁县工商联合会在普遍检查了城关工商界执行爱国公约情况后，即召开了全城关二百余工商业者参加的大会，会上表扬了积极执行爱国公约的十二人，并给予“执行公约模范”的光荣称号；同时也批评了四户违犯爱国公约的工商业者。这样，大大地启发了大家实现爱国公约的积极性。有的人在检查后向其他工商业者提出具体条件发起竞赛，保证坚决执行爱国公约。但也有某些单位在检查中只发现了一大堆缺点和问题，没有根据实际情况，肯定成绩，并找出订立、执行爱国公约较好的典型，作为引导大家前进的方向。另外，也有的地方发现了缺点而不加以批评、纠正，这些都会影响群众的积极性，因而失去检查工作的作用。
    第四，根据不同情况，补充修正爱国公约，使爱国公约经常保持充实的内容，经常起着推动工作的动力作用。有些单位已经完成某些规定，在修订公约时，便提出了更高的要求；有些单位，特别是在农村，季节性的工作完成后，便根据新的情况进行了修订；某些单位的爱国公约原来内容繁琐，修订得简明扼要了，空洞的修订得具体了，条件过高或过低的，修订得切合实际了。许多单位在修订爱国公约时，均采取了运用典型推动一般的方法。如天津铁路局天津车辆厂工会主席亲自帮助王德才小组，研究了该组情况，补订出改进技术、建立学习制度的条文，对全厂修订爱国公约起了示范作用。
    各地在检查爱国公约之后，一般都订出了经常的检查制度或建立了固定的检查组织，保证不断推动爱国公约运动。
    截至目前为止，仍有部分地区尚未着手检查爱国公约的推行情况；有的地区虽已作了检查，但非常不深入。如开封市工商界只是由工商联印发了检查表格，许多行业的公会主任或书记按表随便填写一下，应付了事，根本没起作用。这值得引起各地注意。
