    Our Great Motherland
    Comrade Guan Chonggui, the Communist Party member who wields the light machine gun, is the deputy squad leader of the seventh squad of the first company of the first battalion of the Huashan unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. On February 4th, while defending the 416th Highland south of Meiyun Pass, he held the position with a light machine gun, repelling three assaults by more than 500 American soldiers, wounding and killing more than 50 American soldiers. When more than a dozen enemy planes strafed wildly, he used his light machine gun to fire at the planes, shooting down a "P-51" enemy plane, earning a special-class merit and two major merits, and was awarded the title of "Combat Hero."
