　　Grasp the Seasonal Price Difference of Cotton to Protect the Interests of Cotton Farmers
    Central Trade Department Stipulates New Cotton Purchase Methods
    Directs Localities to Publicize New Cotton Prices to Cotton Farmers and Promote Farmers' Sales of Stored Old Cotton
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, in order to grasp the seasonal price differences in cotton and protect the interests of cotton farmers, has, based on this year's cotton production situation and taking into account the cotton-grain price ratio at the time of new cotton's entry into the market, stipulated this year's new cotton purchase prices and announced them in advance. These regulations will take effect on September 1st, in order to give farmers with stored old cotton time to sell their stored cotton.

    The new cotton purchase prices for major cotton-producing areas and yarn and cloth production cities are as follows: Unit (Jin 斤, approx. 0.5 kg)
    Shanghai  9500 yuan    Tianjin  9000 yuan
    Qingdao  9000 yuan    Xi'an  8200 yuan
    Hankou  8500 yuan
      The above are all baled prices
    Dezhou  8400 yuan    Jinan  8550 yuan
    Linqing  8250 yuan    Shijiazhuang 8250 yuan
    Baoding  8400 yuan    Beijing  8700 yuan
    Taiyuan  8200 yuan    Xinxiang 8250 yuan
    Zhengzhou 8300 yuan    The above are all loose cotton prices

    Compared with current prices, the new cotton purchase prices are on average 5.14% lower; however, they are 18% higher than last year's cotton purchase price level.

    The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has issued instructions, ordering local trade administrative departments and the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation to publicize the new cotton purchase prices to cotton farmers through newspapers, radio broadcasts, blackboards, and mass meetings. They should explain that the new cotton price stipulated by the state this year is slightly higher than the cotton-grain price ratio stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. At the same time, it should be explained that if farmers with stored cotton sell their stored cotton to the state before September 1st, they can avoid losses after the cotton price drops, and the state can gain control of the cotton in advance to support the needs of the textile industry. This is beneficial to both cotton farmers and the country.

    The instructions also ordered local trade administrative departments to continue to strengthen market management earnestly, organize private factories to jointly purchase, and organize cotton merchants and peddlers to purchase cotton for the state. The state's advance purchases, purchases, and cotton merchants' agency purchases or self-purchases, and private factories' joint purchases, must all be in accordance with the state's unified quality standards and unified prices. Those who disrupt the market by lowering or raising purchase prices should be severely punished.

    The instructions required local trade administrative departments and professional companies at all levels to actively organize the production of handicrafts needed by cotton farmers in order to increase the supply of industrial products. The professional head offices must allocate materials needed by cotton farmers to cotton-producing areas as soon as possible, and the professional companies in cotton-producing areas must also cooperate closely to carry out a chain of operations to prevent price instability caused by excessive投放 in local areas.

　　掌握棉花季节差价保护棉农利益
    中央贸易部规定新棉收购办法 
    指示各地向棉农宣传新棉价格推动农民售储陈棉
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府贸易部为掌握棉花季节差价，保护棉农利益，特根据今年棉花生产情况，照顾新棉上市时的棉粮比价，规定今年新棉收购价格，并预先予以公布。此项规定于九月一日起开始执行，以便给存有陈棉的农民以售储棉花的时间。
    各主要产棉区市场及纱布生产城市新棉收购牌价如下：单位（斤）
    上海    九五○○元    天津    九○○○元
    青岛    九○○○元    西安    八二○○元
    汉口    八五○○元
      以上均为成包价格
    德州    八四○○元    济南    八五五○元
    临清    八二五○元    石庄    八二五○元
    保定    八四○○元    北京    八七○○元
    太原    八二○○元    新乡    八二五○元
    郑州    八三○○元    以上均为散花价格
    新棉收购牌价与目前牌价比较，平均降低百分之五点一四；但较去年棉花收购价格水平却高百分之十八。
    中央人民政府贸易部为此发出指示，责成各地贸易行政部门及中国花纱布公司通过报纸、广播、黑板报及群众大会等，向棉农宣传新棉花收购价格，说明今年国家规定的新棉价格是稍高于中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会规定的棉粮比价的。同时说明，有存棉的农民如在九月一日前把存棉卖给国家，一方面可以避免棉花降价后的损失，另一方面也可以使国家提前掌握棉花，以支持纺织工业生产的需要。这对棉农有利，对国家也有利。
    指示并责成各地贸易行政部门继续认真地加强市场管理，组织私人厂商联购，并组织棉商小贩为国家购棉。国家的预购、收购和棉商的代购或自购、私厂的联购，均必须按照国家规定的统一的质量标准及统一的价格。对于降低或抬价收购扰乱市场者，应给以严格处分。
    指示要求各地贸易行政部门及各级专业公司，必须积极地组织棉农需要的手工业品的生产，以增加工业品供应数量。各专业总公司必须及早向产棉地区调拨棉农需要的物资，各产棉地区的专业公司亦须密切配合，开展连环业务，防止由于局部地区投放较多而引起的物价不稳现象。
