Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th—In the East China region, the livelihood difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, as well as disabled revolutionary soldiers, have generally been resolved. In early this year, according to incomplete statistics, the people of East China donated 5,377,711,000 yuan in Renminbi, more than 800,080 jin of rice, and a large quantity of New Year cakes, vegetables, and daily necessities to the families of martyrs, soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, helping them solve their living difficulties. The people's governments at all levels in East China also allocated 143,930,000 jin of relief grain to impoverished families of martyrs and soldiers during the spring and summer seasons.

In February of this year, the people's governments at all levels in East China universally inspected and summarized the preferential treatment work of the past year, and led the peasant masses in reorganizing the substitute farming organizations. More than 80 percent of the substitute farming organizations in areas such as Shandong, Subei, Northern Anhui, and Southern Anhui have been reorganized, implementing a fixed responsibility system for substitute farming. Areas with better conditions have implemented a contracted output system or a work point system. In many areas, farmers have included substitute farming work in their patriotic pledges.

Each village in Dongliu County, Southern Anhui, has established a preferential treatment work committee, composed of the village head, the director of the farmers' association, and representatives of the families of martyrs and soldiers. Underneath this, inspection teams have been established according to neighborhoods or natural villages to regularly supervise and inspect the work. Because the masses understand that preferential treatment work is a practical action to resist America and aid Korea, and with certain organizational leadership, preferential treatment work in the county has become a mass movement. For example, farmers in the three villages of Baishi, Putang, and Tangxia in the county immediately organized more than 100 people to carry water to irrigate the fields for families of martyrs and soldiers lacking labor when a drought occurred this spring. This year, all of Shandong Province's more than 4 million mu of substitute farming land has been cultivated and weeded in a timely manner. Farmers in some areas have also helped the families of martyrs and soldiers solve the difficulties of lacking means of production. According to a survey of 39 villages in Yexian County, Shandong, during the spring planting season this year, farmers donated 32,516 jin and 1,546 loads of manure, 1,511 jin of fertilizer powder, and 1,572 jin of soybean cake. As a result, 459 families of martyrs and soldiers lacking fertilizer had sufficient fertilizer.

Most of the families of martyrs and soldiers residing in cities have now found employment or have joined production. Since January of this year, more than 3,500 families of martyrs and soldiers in Shanghai have found jobs with the help of the people's government and various people's organizations. By the end of June this year, Nanjing had resolved the employment and livelihood difficulties of families of martyrs and soldiers, accounting for 77.3 percent of the total number of households and 86.4 percent of the total number of people. In addition to continuing to lead and support the original production organizations of families of martyrs and soldiers, the people's governments in cities such as Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, and Qingdao have also helped them organize production institutions such as sack factories, flour mills, cotton weaving mills, knitting mills, and cooperatives. Wuhu City has established a production committee for families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, based on police stations, to organize the families' own strength to carry out various sideline productions. At present, more than half of the police stations in the city have formed soap factories, mosquito incense factories, handicraft production cooperatives (temporarily focusing on making cloth shoes), and production groups for twisting hemp rope, making tofu, and pasting matchboxes. In the Chengzhong police station jurisdiction alone, the number of families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers participating in production accounts for more than 80 percent of the total number of families.

Since the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea issued the "June 1st" three major appeals, various agencies, organizations, and citizens in Nanjing have transformed the festive comfort activities for families of martyrs and soldiers into regular work to assist them in solving practical difficulties. Everyone has made doing a good job in preferential treatment work one of the contents of their patriotic pledges. For example, barbers in the third district of the city have stipulated that they will provide free haircuts twice a month for the families of martyrs, soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers in the vicinity. The boiler industry has printed 90,000 free water tickets (worth 9 million yuan) and distributed them to impoverished families of martyrs and soldiers throughout the city through the Support the Army and Give Preferential Treatment to Families Committee. Residents in the city have established organizations to support the army and give preferential treatment to families based on household sections, regularly conducting comfort work and launching residents to carry out voluntary labor days to carry water, repair houses, etc., for families of martyrs, soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers. More than 47,000 people in the third district of the city participated in the "voluntary labor day" in early last month. In order to solve the problem of school enrollment for the children of families of martyrs and soldiers, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Education Bureau and Civil Affairs Bureau have jointly formulated specific measures to give preferential treatment to the children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers in school enrollment. In order to do a good job in this work, the Shanghai education community has launched teachers and staff in schools throughout the city to determine the preferential treatment quotas for reducing or waiving tuition or school fees for the children of families of martyrs and soldiers, on the premise of not hindering the maintenance of the school and not affecting the living conditions of teachers and staff. At present, the total number of preferential treatment quotas determined by schools throughout the city has greatly exceeded the total number of children of families of martyrs and soldiers who are out of school in the city.

　　华东各地优待烈军属成为经常工作
    订出各种优抚办法并把优抚工作列入爱国公约
    【新华社上海九日电】华东地区的革命烈士和革命军人的家属及革命残废军人的生活上的困难，一般都已得到解决。今年初，据不完全统计，华东各地人民捐献了人民币五十三亿七千七百一十一万元，大米八十万零八千多斤，和大批年糕、菜蔬和日用品，送给烈属、军属和革命残废军人，帮他们解决生活上的困难。华东各地人民政府并在春、夏两季，拨发了一亿四千三百九十三万斤救济粮给贫苦的烈属和军属。
    在今年二月间，华东各地人民政府曾普遍地检查和总结了去年的优抚工作，并领导农民群众整理了代耕组织。山东、苏北、皖北、皖南等地区的代耕组织已有百分之八十以上经过整理，实行了固定专责制的代耕方法。条件较好的地区并实行了包产制或工票制。许多地区的农民把代耕工作列入了爱国公约。
    皖南东流县各村都成立了优抚工作委员会，由村长、农会主任、烈属、军属代表等组成，其下并按闾或自然村成立检查小组经常督促检查。由于群众认识了优抚工作就是抗美援朝的实际行动的道理，并且有一定的组织领导，优抚工作在该县已成为群众性的工作。例如该县白石、浦塘、塘夏三个村的农民，在今春发生旱象时，立即组织了一百多人，替缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属挑水灌田。山东全省四百多万亩代耕土地，今年都及时耕种与修锄。有些地区的农民，还帮助烈属、军属解决了缺乏生产资料的困难。据山东掖县三十九个村的调查，今年春种时，农民捐助了粪肥三万二千五百十六斤又一千五百四十六驮、肥田粉一千五百一十一斤，豆饼一千五百七十二斤，四百五十九户缺乏肥料的烈属、军属因而有了充足的肥料。
    居住在城市中的烈属和军属，现已大部就业或参加了生产。上海市自今年一月以来已有三千五百多名烈属和军属在人民政府及各人民团体帮助下找到了职业。南京市到本年六月底止，解决了就业与生活困难的烈属、军属，已占总户数的百分之七十七点三，总人数的百分之八十六点四。南京、杭州、济南、青岛等城市的人民政府，除继续领导和扶持烈属、军属的原有生产组织外，又帮助他们组织了麻袋厂、面粉厂、棉织厂、针织厂、合作社等生产机构。芜湖市以派出所为单位，成立了烈、军、工属生产委员会，组织家属们本身力量，进行各种副业生产。现在全市已有半数以上的派出所组成了肥皂厂、蚊烟厂、手工业生产社（暂以制布鞋为主），以及搓麻绳、作豆腐、糊火柴盒等生产组。仅城中派出所管区内参加生产的烈、军、工属即占家属总人数的百分之八十以上。
    自抗美援朝总会发出“六一”三大号召以后，南京市各机关团体和市民，已把对烈属、军属的节日性慰问活动，转为经常协助烈属、军属解决实际困难的工作。大家都把做好优抚工作作为爱国公约内容之一。如该市三区的理发工人定出每月替附近的烈属、军属和革命残废军人理发两次。水炉业印发了九万张免费水票（值九百万元）通过拥军优属委员会发给全市贫苦烈属、军属。市内居民以户口段为单位，成立了拥军优属组织，经常进行慰问工作，并发动居民实行义务劳动日，替烈属、军属、革命残废军人挑水、修房屋等。该市三区居民参加上月初旬的“义务劳动日”的就有四万七千多人。为了解决烈属、军属子弟入学问题，上海市人民政府教育局和民政局已经联合订出了优待革命烈士及革命军人子弟入学的具体办法。上海市教育界为做好这项工作，已经发动全市学校的教职员工，在不妨碍学校的维持和不影响教职员工的生活待遇的前提下，认定减免烈、军属子弟学费或学、杂费的优待名额。现全市学校认定优待名额的总数已经大大超过了全市失学的烈属、军属子弟的总人数。
