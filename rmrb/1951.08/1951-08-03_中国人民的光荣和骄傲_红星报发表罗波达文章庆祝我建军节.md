Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd. TASS dispatch: To commemorate the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Red Star Newspaper published an article by Major Roboda on the 1st, entitled "The Glory and Pride of the Chinese People." Roboda pointed out that the People's Liberation Army has gone through a great and glorious combat path since its birth. The entire history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the past 24 years is the history of the heroic achievements of the glorious sons of the Chinese people in striving for the freedom and happiness of the motherland. The Chinese Communist Party founded and led the Chinese People's Liberation Army, winning freedom and independence for the Chinese people. Roboda described in detail the history of the development of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, saying: The lofty goal of the just liberation struggle has inspired the commanders and fighters of the young Chinese Red Army. The conscious revolutionary discipline of the Red Army personnel is the source of strength of this new army. In combat, the fighters of this revolutionary army demonstrated collective heroism, resourcefulness, initiative, and the ability to overcome difficulties and defeat enemies who were superior in number and equipment. After the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the American imperialists launched a civil war in China, intending to use their Kuomintang mercenaries to eliminate the revolutionary army of the Chinese people and turn China into their colony. However, the Chinese People's Liberation Army shattered the enemy's despicable attempt and saved the Chinese people from the danger of being enslaved by foreign imperialists again. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has created eternal glory for itself in the fierce battles with the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

　　Roboda pointed out: The active support given to the People's Liberation Army by the entire Chinese people is the guarantee of its success. The Chinese people regard the People's Liberation Army as the liberator who liberated them from the long-term oppression of the imperialists and feudal landlords. Wherever this glorious army goes, there is peace, happiness and justice. Therefore, the Chinese people support their army with all their strength.

　　Roboda continued: The People's Liberation Army has been tempered into steel in the struggle. Its organization is perfect and its discipline is excellent. It has become a powerful and unassailable force, a fortress of peace and security in China. Leading the Chinese armed forces are long-tested leaders. Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, is the chairman of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government. Zhu De is the commander-in-chief. The People's Liberation Army has established a model of heroism and fearlessness and examples of how to fight in the years of war. Now, under the leadership of these leaders, they are constantly improving their combat training.

　　Roboda finally said: The Chinese people have once and for all shattered the shackles of imperialism and feudal landlords. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is vigilantly guarding the peaceful labor of the Chinese people and the freedom and independence of the People's Republic of China, protecting it from the conspiracies of the imperialists.

　　“中国人民的光荣和骄傲”
    红星报发表罗波达文章庆祝我建军节
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：红星报为纪念中国人民解放军建军二十四周年，于一日发表罗波达少校所作题为《中国人民的光荣和骄傲》的文章。罗波达指出：人民解放军从诞生以来，已经历了伟大而光荣的战斗道路。中国人民解放军二十四年来的全部历史，就是中国人民光荣的儿子为争取祖国的自由和幸福的英雄业迹的历史。中国共产党创立并领导中国人民解放军，为中国人民争取到自由和独立。罗波达详细叙述了中国人民解放军的发展的历史说：正义的解放斗争的崇高目标，曾鼓舞了年青的中国红军的指挥员和战斗员们。红军人员自觉的革命纪律就是这支新军力量的源泉。在战斗当中，这支革命军队的战斗员表现了集体英雄主义、机智、主动和克服困难打败在人数装备上都占优势的敌人的能力。在抗日战争之后，美帝国主义者发动了中国的内战，打算利用他们的国民党雇佣军来消灭中国人民的革命大军，并把中国变成他们的殖民地。但是，中国人民解放军粉碎了敌人的这种卑劣的图谋，拯救中国人民免于再次受外国帝国主义者奴役的危险。中国人民解放军在与帝国主义者及国民党反动派的激烈战斗中，为自己创造了永恒不灭的光荣。
    罗波达指出：全中国人民给予人民解放军的积极支持，就是使它成功的保证。中国人民认为人民解放军是把他们从帝国主义者和封建地主长期压迫下解放出来的解放者。这支光荣的军队到了那里，那里就有了和平、幸福与正义。因此，中国人民以一切力量来支持他们的军队。
    罗波达接着说：人民解放军已在斗争中锻炼成钢。它的组织完善，纪律优良。它已成为一支强大不可轻侮的力量，成为中国的和平与安全的堡垒。率领中国武装部队的是久经锻炼的领袖。中国人民领袖毛泽东是中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会主席。朱德是总司令。人民解放军在战争的年月里已树立了英勇无畏的楷模和如何作战的范例，现在他们正在这些首长的领导下，使他们的战斗训练从不断改进中臻于完善。
    罗波达最后说：中国人民已一劳永逸地打碎了帝国主义和封建地主的枷锁，中国人民解放军正警觉地警卫着中国人民的和平劳动，警卫着中华人民共和国的自由和独立，使它不受帝国主义者阴谋的侵害。
