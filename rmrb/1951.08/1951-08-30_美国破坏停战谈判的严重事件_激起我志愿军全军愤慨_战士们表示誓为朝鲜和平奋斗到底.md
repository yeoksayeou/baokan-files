Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 29th: Our correspondent reports: The US aggressors' invasion of the Kaesong neutral zone, the murder of our platoon leader Yao, the air raid on the Kaesong neutral zone, the attempted assassination of our negotiating representatives, and the offensive launched on the eastern front – this series of grave incidents of deliberate sabotage of the ceasefire talks has aroused extreme indignation throughout the entire Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Soldiers have expressed their resolve to avenge their comrade-in-arms Platoon Leader Yao and to fight to the end for a just peace in Korea.

Combat Hero Guan Chonggui of a certain unit said: "When the negotiations began, we adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the US aggressors. Today, facts have proved that the US has no sincerity for peace and is determined to continue its aggression. If the US aggressors have not forgotten the fact that we once drove them from the Yalu River to south of the Han River, they should realize that the Chinese and Korean People's armies, which have gained practical combat experience and whose technical equipment is constantly being strengthened, have more than enough power to defend peace in Korea!" This combat hero once shot down an enemy plane with fourteen bullets and wiped out more than fifty American devils with a single machine gun in a certain battle. Sun Xitang, a platoon leader of a certain unit who made great contributions in the Fourth Campaign, said: "The American warmongers are simply too lawless. The steeled Chinese and Korean People's armies know how to deal with these mad beasts."

The artillery unit of a certain Volunteer Army unit published a wall newspaper in the shelter to mourn Platoon Leader Yao, and all commanders and fighters swore: If the American bandits insist on fighting, we must cooperate with the infantry to annihilate the American murderers. Anti-aircraft gunners and anti-tank gunners of the Volunteer Army units have formulated their own merit-making plans. The plans stated: If the American bandits want to act recklessly to the end, we will shoot down more enemy planes and destroy more enemy tanks to pay tribute to Platoon Leader Yao, who sacrificed for peace, and other comrades-in-arms who gloriously sacrificed to defend peace.

　　美国破坏停战谈判的严重事件
    激起我志愿军全军愤慨
    战士们表示誓为朝鲜和平奋斗到底
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】本社记者报道：美国侵略者侵犯开城中立区杀害我姚排长，空袭开城中立区，企图谋杀我方谈判代表，并在东线发动攻势，这一连串蓄意破坏停战谈判的严重事件，激起了中国人民志愿军全军上下的极度愤慨。战士们纷纷表示，誓为战友姚排长报仇，誓为争取朝鲜的公正的和平而奋斗到底。
    某部战斗英雄关崇贵说：“谈判开始时，我们就对美国侵略者抱着听其言而观其行的态度。今天，事实证明美国确实没有和平诚意，而是决心侵略到底。如果美国侵略者还没有忘记我们曾经把它们从鸭绿江赶到汉江以南的事实的话，就应该认识到已经取得了实战经验的、技术装备正在不断加强的中朝人民军队，有更充分的力量来捍卫朝鲜的和平！”这位战斗英雄曾在某次战斗中，用十四发子弹击落敌机一架，以一挺机枪消灭五十多个美国鬼子。曾在第四次战役立过大功的某部排长孙喜堂说：“美国战争贩子们简直是太无法无天了。百炼成钢的中朝人民军队是懂得怎样对待这些疯狂的野兽的。”
    志愿军某部炮兵部队在掩蔽部里出刊了追悼姚排长的壁报，全体指战员宣誓：如果美国强盗硬要打下去，我们就一定要协同步兵痛歼美国杀人犯。志愿军各部的高射炮手、反坦克手们纷纷订出了自己的立功计划。计划上面写着：如果美国强盗要蛮干到底，我们就要打下更多的敌机、炸毁更多的敌坦克，来祭奠为和平而牺牲的姚排长和其他为保卫和平而光荣牺牲的战友。
