The Eight Heroes Who Would Rather Die Than Submit
(Picture by Jiang Ping)

(I) The "Special Merit Platoon" of the Iron Battalion of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers created glorious achievements in the battle of annihilation against the British 29th Brigade in late April. In an hour and a half, they destroyed seven enemy tanks, one armored vehicle, and three trucks, killing and wounding more than fifty enemies and capturing fifty-nine alive.

(II) On June 5th, eight warriors of the "Special Merit Platoon," led by Deputy Platoon Leader Li Bingqun, guarded the Fahuadong North Mountain position southwest of Tieyuan. They were to hold these mountain peaks that faced the enemy on two sides and had cliffs on the other two. These eight warriors were: Chinese Communist Party member and Deputy Platoon Leader Li Bingqun, soldiers He Chengyu, Qu Guoling, Cui Xuecai, Zhang Qiuchang, Meng Qingxiu, and non-Party member soldiers Hou Tianyou and Luo Juncheng.

(III) After fighting continuously for several nights, the eight warriors had no rest and accepted a new arduous task. They built fortifications overnight, and just as they sat down to grab a handful of dry fried noodles, the enemy began shelling.

    宁死不屈的八勇士
    江平作
    （一）中国人民志愿军某部钢铁营的“特功排”，在四月下旬痛歼英军二十九旅的战斗中，曾创造了光辉战绩，在一个半钟头内，击毁了敌人坦克七辆、装甲车一辆、汽车三辆，打死打伤敌人五十多，活捉五十九名。
    （二）六月五日“特功排”的八位勇士在副排长李秉群率领下，守卫铁原西南的法化洞北山阵地，他们要据守这两面临敌两面是悬崖的山峰。这八位勇士是：中国共产党员副排长李秉群、战士何成玉、瞿过灵、崔学才、张秋昌、孟庆修、非党员战士侯天佑、罗俊成。
    （三）连续战斗几夜，八勇士没有休息，就接受了新的艰巨的任务。他们连夜赶筑好了工事，刚刚坐下来抓两把干炒面往口里送，敌人就开始炮击了。
