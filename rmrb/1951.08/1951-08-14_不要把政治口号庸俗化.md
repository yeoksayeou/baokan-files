    Do Not Vulgarize Political Slogans
    Editor:
    The Harbin Cigarette Factory recently printed some advertising posters, one of which not only juxtaposed the political slogan "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Protect the Country" with the various cigarette brands produced by the factory, but also juxtaposed it with the business promotional phrases "Fragrant and palatable, renowned throughout the Northeast," making the solemn political slogan vulgar. In the picture, workers and farmers raise their hands holding cigarettes to demonstrate against the warmongers, and next to it is written "Use our 'cigarettes' to give the warmongers a head-on blow." This expression of using cigarette butts to strike the warmongers, apart from stating "Our cigarette factory produces so-and-so brand cigarettes," can only give the viewer a very unserious feeling. It is hoped that manufacturers everywhere, when printing all publicity materials, will not vulgarize political slogans.

### 不要把政治口号庸俗化

    不要把政治口号庸俗化编辑同志：
    哈尔滨制烟厂最近印发了一些广告画，其中有一张不但把“抗美援朝保家卫国”的政治口号和该厂出品的各种卷烟牌子并列，还把“芬芳适口、誉驰东北”的营业宣传语句也并列在一起，使得庄严的政治口号变得庸俗化。画中的工人、农民举起捏着卷烟的手对着战争贩子示威，并在旁边写着“用我们的出品‘卷烟’来给战争贩子们一个迎头痛击”，这种用烟卷头打击战争贩子的表现，除了说明“我们烟厂出品某某牌香烟”外，只能给观者以极不严肃的感觉。希望各地厂商在印发一切宣传品时，不要把政治口号庸俗化。
