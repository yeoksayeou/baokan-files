This article is a report given by Comrade Mao Zedong at the Party Activists Conference in Yan'an, Shaanxi. Mao Zedong's report was delivered in December 1935, following the Central Political Bureau meeting in Yan'an. This meeting criticized the erroneous view within the Party that the Chinese national bourgeoisie could not unite with the Chinese workers and peasants to resist Japan. It decided on the strategy of establishing a united front, making it a crucial central meeting. Based on the Central Committee's resolution, Mao Zedong thoroughly explained the possibility and importance of re-establishing a united front with the national bourgeoisie under the condition of resisting Japan. He emphasized the decisive leadership role of the Communist Party and the Red Army within this united front, pointed out the long-term nature of the Chinese revolution, and criticized the narrow-minded sectarianism and impatience with the revolution that had existed within the Party for a long time—these were the fundamental reasons for the Party and the Red Army suffering severe setbacks during the Second Civil Revolutionary War. At the same time, Mao Zedong reminded the Party of the historical lesson of Chen Duxiu's right opportunism leading the revolution to failure in 1927, pointing out the inevitable trend of Chiang Kai-shek to destroy revolutionary forces. This ensured that the Party could maintain a clear mind in the new environment, avoiding losses in revolutionary forces amidst Chiang Kai-shek's endless deception and numerous armed attacks. In January 1935, the Party Central Committee held an enlarged Political Bureau meeting in Zunyi, Guizhou, establishing a new central leadership with Mao Zedong at the helm, changing the previous left opportunist leadership. However, that meeting was convened during the Long March, so it could only make decisions on the most urgent military issues and organizational matters of the Central Secretariat and the Central Revolutionary Military Commission. After the Red Army reached Shaanxi, the Party Central Committee gained the opportunity to systematically explain political strategy issues. For these political strategy issues, Mao Zedong's report provided the most complete analysis.

**The Current Political Situation**

Comrades! The current political situation has undergone significant changes. Based on these changes, our Party has set its tasks.

What is the current situation like?

The fundamental feature of the current situation is that Japanese imperialism aims to turn China into its colony.

Everyone knows that for nearly a hundred years, China has been a semi-colony jointly ruled by several imperialist countries. Due to the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and the conflicts among imperialist countries, China has managed to maintain a semi-independent status. The First World War once provided Japan with an opportunity to dominate China. However, the Chinese people's resistance against Japanese imperialism and the intervention of other imperialist countries rendered the "Twenty-One Demands" signed by the traitor Yuan Shikai ineffective. The Nine-Power Treaty signed at the Washington Conference in 1922, convened by the United States, returned China to a state of being jointly ruled by several imperialist countries. However, this situation soon changed again. The September 18th Incident in 1931 marked the beginning of the stage where Japan sought to turn China into its colony. Although the scope of Japan's aggression was initially limited to the four northeastern provinces, it gave people the impression that Japanese imperialists might not advance further. Today, things are different. Japanese imperialists have shown their intention to advance into mainland China. They aim to occupy all of China. Recent events in the Hebei Eastern Region and diplomatic negotiations have indicated this direction, threatening the survival of the entire nation. This situation has posed the question of "what to do" for all classes and political factions in China. Resistance? Surrender? Or waver between the two?

Now, let's see how the various classes in China respond to this question.

The Chinese workers and peasants are demanding resistance. The revolution from 1924 to 1927, the land revolution from 1927 to the present, and the anti-Japanese wave since the September 18th Incident in 1931 have proven that the Chinese working class and peasantry are the most resolute forces in the Chinese revolution.

The Chinese petty bourgeoisie also wants resistance. Young students and urban petty bourgeoisie have already launched a massive anti-Japanese movement, haven't they? These petty bourgeoisie elements in China participated in the revolution from 1924 to 1927. Like the peasants, they have an economic position of small production that is irreconcilable with imperialism. Imperialism and Chinese counter-revolutionary forces have inflicted heavy losses on them, causing many to fall into unemployment, bankruptcy, or semi-bankruptcy. Now, they see themselves on the verge of becoming slaves, and resistance is their only way out.

What about the national bourgeoisie, comprador class, and landlord class? What about the Kuomintang? The question is posed before them.

The big landlords, big gentry, big warlords, big officials, and big compradors have already made up their minds. They have been saying and still say: "Any revolution (no matter what kind) is worse than imperialism." They have formed a traitor camp, and in front of them, there is no question of whether to become a slave or not. They have removed the national boundaries, their interests are inseparable from those of imperialism, and their leader is Chiang Kai-shek. This traitor camp is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. Without this group of traitors, Japanese imperialism would not have been able to act so brazenly. They are the running dogs of imperialism.

The national bourgeoisie is a complex issue. This class participated in the revolution from 1924 to 1927 but was later frightened by the revolutionary flames and stood on the side of the enemy, the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The question is, in today's situation, is there a possibility for the national bourgeoisie to change? We believe there is such a possibility. This is because the national bourgeoisie is not the same as the landlord class and the comprador class; there are differences between them. The national bourgeoisie does not have as much feudalism as the landlord class or as much compradorism as the comprador class. Within the national bourgeoisie, there is a part that has more relations with foreign capital and domestic land, which is the right wing of the national bourgeoisie. We will not estimate their possibility of change for now. The question is about those parts that have no such relations or have fewer relations. We believe that under the new environment of colonialism, the attitudes of these parts of the national bourgeoisie may change. The characteristic of this change is their vacillation. On the one hand, they do not like imperialism; on the other hand, they fear the thoroughness of the revolution. They vacillate between the two. This explains why they participated in the revolution during the period from 1924 to 1927 and why they stood on the side of Chiang Kai-shek by the end of this period. What is the difference between this period and the period when Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927? At that time, China was still a semi-colony. Now, it is heading towards being a colony. For nine years, they have abandoned their ally, the working class, and befriended the landlord and comprador classes. What benefits have they gained? They have gained nothing but the bankruptcy or semi-bankruptcy of national industry and commerce. Because of these circumstances, we believe that the attitude of the national bourgeoisie has the possibility of change in today's situation. To what extent will this change occur? The general characteristic is vacillation. However, in certain stages of the struggle, a part of them (the left wing) has the possibility of participating in the struggle. Another part may adopt a neutral attitude from vacillation.

What class interests do Cai Tingyang and others, who led the 19th Route Army, represent? They represent the national bourgeoisie, the upper petty bourgeoisie, the rich peasants, and the small landlords in the countryside. Cai Tingyang and his comrades have not fought to the death with the Red Army? Yet later, they formed an anti-Japanese, anti-Chiang alliance with the Red Army. In Jiangxi, they attacked the Red Army; in Shanghai, they resisted Japanese imperialism; in Fujian, they formed a compromise with the Red Army and opened fire on Chiang Kai-shek. Regardless of what Cai Tingyang and his comrades' future endeavors are, and regardless of how the Fujian People's Government still adheres to the old ways without mobilizing the masses, they have turned the firepower originally aimed at the Red Army to Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, which cannot be said to be beneficial to the revolution. This is a split in the Kuomintang camp. After the September 18th Incident, why can't the environment today create a split in the Kuomintang? Those within our Party who hold such a view are wrong. They say that the entire landlord and bourgeois camp is unified and fixed, and no circumstances can cause it to change. They not only fail to recognize today's serious situation but also forget history.

Let me tell you a bit of history. In 1926 and 1927, when the revolutionary army advanced to Wuhan and even reached Henan, Tang Shengzhi and Feng Yuxiang participated in the revolution. Feng Yuxiang even cooperated with the Communist Party in 1933 in Chahar to establish the Anti-Japanese Allied Army.

Another clear example is the 26th Route Army, which attacked the Jiangxi Red Army together with the 19th Route Army. It did not stage the Ningdu Uprising in December 1931 and become the Red Army? The leaders of the Ningdu Uprising, Zhao Bogeng, Dong Zhen Tang, and others became resolute revolutionary comrades.

Ma Zhanxiang's anti-Japanese actions in the Northeast are also a split within the ruling camp.

All these examples indicate that when the power of Japanese bombs reaches the entire China, when the struggle changes from its normal state and suddenly surges forward, the enemy's camp will split.

Comrades, now let us turn to another point.

If someone uses the political and economic weakness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie to oppose our argument, claiming that the Chinese national bourgeoisie, despite being in a new environment, has not changed its attitude, is this statement correct? I believe it is also incorrect. If the reason for not being able to change is the weakness of the national bourgeoisie, then why did they change their normal state from 1924 to 1927, not just vacillate, but actually participate in the revolution? Did the weakness of the national bourgeoisie become a new problem only later, and not a long-standing problem they were born with? Was it not weak then, and is it weak now? One of the main characteristics of semi-colonial politics and economics is the weakness of the national bourgeoisie. It is precisely because of this that imperialism dares to bully them, and this also determines their characteristic of not liking imperialism. Of course, we do not only deny but also fully acknowledge that it is precisely because of this that imperialism and the landlord-comprador class can easily use some temporary bribes as bait to lure them over, and this also determines their lack of thoroughness in the revolution. However, it cannot be said that in today's situation, they have no differences with the landlord class and the comprador class.

Therefore, we emphasize: In the Kuomintang camp, when the national crisis reaches a critical point, there will be splits. This split is manifested in the vacillation of the national bourgeoisie and in the temporary anti-Japanese figures like Feng Yuxiang, Cai Tingyang, and Ma Zhanxiang. This situation, fundamentally speaking, is unfavorable to the counter-revolution and favorable to the revolution. Due to the imbalance in China's politics and economics and the resulting imbalance in the development of the revolution, the possibility of such splits has increased.

Comrades! The positive aspect of this issue has been discussed. Now let me talk about the negative aspect, that is, the issue of some members of the national bourgeoisie often being good at deceiving the masses. Why? Because among them, apart from those who truly support the people's revolutionary cause, there are many who can appear in the guise of revolutionaries, semi-revolutionaries, or pseudo-revolutionaries for a period, so they simultaneously possess the qualifications to deceive the masses, making it difficult for the masses to recognize their lack of thoroughness and their pretentious falsehood. This increases the responsibility of the Communist Party to criticize allies, expose false revolutionaries, and strive for leadership. If we deny the possibility of vacillation and participation in the revolution by the national bourgeoisie in times of great upheaval, we would also eliminate or at least reduce our Party's task of striving for leadership. Because if the national bourgeoisie is the same as the landlord-comprador class, appearing with the ferocious face of a traitor, the task of striving for leadership can be eliminated or at least reduced.

In the overall analysis of the attitudes of the Chinese landlord-bourgeoisie in times of great upheaval, there is another aspect that should be pointed out: Even within the landlord-comprador class camp, it is not completely unified. This is the result of the semi-colonial environment, that is, the environment where many imperialists are vying for China. When the struggle is directed against Japanese imperialism, the running dogs of the United States and even Britain may follow the light and heavy commands of their masters to secretly fight or openly contend with Japanese imperialists and their running dogs. We will not mention the past frequent occurrences of such dog fights. Now, let's just talk about Hu Hanmin, a Kuomintang politician who was once imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek, who recently also signed the document of our proposed Six-Point Program for Anti-Japanese National Salvation. The warlords of the Guangdong-Guangxi faction, who rely on Hu Hanmin, also formed an opposition to Chiang Kai-shek under the deceptive slogans of "recovering lost territory" and "anti-Japanese and anti-banditry are equally important" (Chiang Kai-shek's is "first anti-banditry, then anti-Japanese"). You see, isn't it a bit strange? It is not strange. This is just a particularly interesting struggle between big dogs, small dogs, full dogs, and hungry dogs, a small gap, and a contradictory itch. However, this struggle, this gap, and this contradiction are useful to the revolutionary people. We should collect all the struggles, gaps, and contradictions within the enemy camp and use them to fight against the current main enemy.

Summarizing this class relationship issue, it is: Based on the fundamental change that Japanese imperialism has invaded mainland China, the mutual relationships between the various classes in China have changed, expanding the strength of the national revolutionary camp and weakening the strength of the national counter-revolutionary camp.

Now let's talk about the situation within the Chinese national revolutionary camp.

First, let's talk about the situation of the Red Army. Comrades, look, for almost a year and a half, the three main forces of the Chinese Red Army have been making a major transfer of positions. From last August, when Comrade Ren Bishi and others led the Sixth Army Corps to the area of Comrade He Long, the transfer began, followed by our transfer in October. This year in March, the Red Army in the Sichuan-Shaanxi border area also began to transfer. These three Red Armies have all abandoned their original positions and moved to new areas. This major transfer has turned the old areas into guerrilla zones. During the transfer, the Red Army itself has been greatly weakened. If we look at this aspect of the overall situation, the enemy has achieved a temporary partial victory, and we have suffered a temporary partial defeat. Is this statement correct? I think it is correct because it is a fact. However, some people say (for example, Zhang Guotao): The Central Red Army has failed. Is this statement correct? No, it is not. Because this is not a fact. Marxists look at problems not only from a partial perspective but also from a holistic perspective. A frog sitting in a well says: "The sky is as big as the well." This is incorrect because the sky is not just as big as the well. If it says: "A part of the sky is as big as the well." This is correct because it conforms to the facts. We say that the Red Army has failed in one aspect (the aspect of maintaining the original positions), but in another aspect (the aspect of completing the Long March plan), it has succeeded. The enemy has succeeded in one aspect (the aspect of occupying our original positions), but in another aspect (the aspect of implementing the "encirclement and suppression" plan), it has failed. This way of saying it is appropriate because we have completed the Long March.

Speaking of the Long March, what is its significance? We say that the Long March is a first in history, the Long March is a declaration, the Long March is a propaganda team, the Long March is a seed-sowing machine. Since Pangu opened the heavens and earth, from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the present, has there ever been such a Long March in history? In twelve months, there were dozens of planes in the sky every day for reconnaissance and bombing, and hundreds of thousands of troops on the ground pursuing and blocking us. On the road, we encountered countless difficulties and dangers, but we moved forward with our two feet, covering more than twenty thousand li and traversing eleven provinces. Has there ever been such a Long March in history? No, there has never been. The Long March is also a declaration. It proclaims to the world that the Red Army is a band of heroes, while imperialists and their running dogs like Chiang Kai-shek are completely useless. The Long March declared the failure of the imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's pursuit and blockade. The Long March is also a propaganda team. It announced to the approximately two hundred million people in eleven provinces that only the path of the Red Army is the path to their liberation. Without this action, how could such a vast number of people know so quickly that there is a great truth called the Red Army in the world? The Long March is also a seed-sowing machine. It scattered many seeds in eleven provinces, which will sprout, grow leaves, bloom, and bear fruit, and there will be a harvest in the future. In summary, the Long March ended with our victory and the enemy's defeat. Who made the Long March a success? It was the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, such a Long March is unimaginable. The Chinese Communist Party, its leadership, its cadres, and its members are not afraid of any hardships. Whoever doubts our ability to lead revolutionary warfare will fall into the mire of opportunism. As soon as the Long March was completed, a new situation began. The battle of Zhirou Town, the brotherly unity of the Central Red Army and the Northwest Red Army, shattered the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's "encirclement" of the Shaanxi-Gansu border area, and performed an inaugural ceremony for the Party Central Committee to place the national revolutionary base in the northwest.

The main forces of the Red Army are like this, but what about the guerrilla warfare in the southern provinces? The guerrilla warfare in the south has suffered some setbacks, but it has not been eliminated. Many parts are recovering, growing, and developing.

In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the workers' struggles are shifting from within the factories to outside the factories, from economic struggles to political struggles. The working class's heroic struggles against Japan and traitors are now brewing deeply, and it seems that the time for an outbreak is not far away.

The peasants' struggles have never stopped. Under the oppression of external disasters, internal difficulties, and natural disasters, the peasants have launched widespread guerrilla warfare, rebellions, and famine riots. The anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare in Northeast China and Hebei Eastern Region is responding to the Japanese imperialists' aggression.

The student movement has developed greatly and will definitely develop even more in the future. But for the student movement to achieve sustainability, to break through the traitors' martial law, police, spies, academic bullies, and Fascist destruction and massacre, it must be combined with the struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers to have a chance.

The vacillation and participation in the anti-Japanese struggle by the national bourgeoisie, rich peasants, and small landlords in the countryside have been mentioned earlier.

Minorities, especially the Inner Mongolian people, are rising up to fight under the direct threat of Japanese imperialism. Their future will merge with the struggles of the people in North China and the activities of the Red Army in the northwest.

All these indicate that the revolutionary forces are transforming from a local to a national scale, gradually shifting from an imbalanced state to a certain balanced state. The current situation is the eve of a great change. The Party's task is to unite the activities of the Red Army with the activities of all workers, peasants, students, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie across the country, forming a unified national revolutionary front.

**United Front of National Unity**

After observing the situation on both the counter-revolutionary and revolutionary sides, we can easily explain the Party's strategic tasks.

What is the Party's fundamental strategic task? It is not anything else but to establish a broad national revolutionary united front.

When the revolutionary situation has changed, the revolutionary strategy and leadership methods must also change accordingly. The task of Japanese imperialism and the traitorous sellouts is to turn China into a colony. Our task is to turn China into an independent, free, and territorially intact country.

Achieving China's independence and freedom is a great task. This requires fighting against foreign imperialism and domestic counter-revolutionary forces. Japanese imperialism has made a ruthless decision to advance. The counter-revolutionary forces of the domestic landlord-comprador class are currently still stronger than the people's revolutionary forces. The task of overthrowing Japanese imperialism and Chinese counter-revolutionary forces is not something that can be accomplished in a day or two; it requires long-term preparation. It is not something that can be accomplished with a little force; it requires the accumulation of powerful forces. The counter-revolutionary forces in China and the world are relatively weaker compared to the past, and the revolutionary forces in China and the world are relatively stronger compared to the past. This is a correct assessment, this is one aspect of the assessment. However, at the same time, we must say that currently, the counter-revolutionary forces in China and the world are temporarily still stronger than the revolutionary forces. This is also a correct assessment, this is another aspect of the assessment. Due to the imbalance in China's political and economic development, the imbalance in the development of the revolution has been produced. The victory of the revolution always starts and develops first in places where the counter-revolutionary forces are relatively weak; while in places where the counter-revolutionary forces are strong, the revolution has not yet started or is developing slowly. This is the situation that the Chinese revolution has encountered in the past long period. In the future, it can be foreseen that in certain stages, the overall situation of the revolution will be more developed, but the imbalanced state will still exist. To transform the imbalanced state into a generally balanced state, it will still take a long time, still require a lot of effort, and still depend on the correctness of the Party's strategic line. If the revolutionary war led by the Soviet Communist Party was completed in three years, then the revolutionary war led by the Chinese Communist Party has already spent a long time in the past, and to finally and thoroughly solve the internal and external counter-revolutionary forces, we still need to prepare to spend an appropriate amount of time. Being overly impatient as in the past is not acceptable. We must propose a good revolutionary strategy, and being stuck in a narrow circle as in the past will not accomplish great things. It is not that China's affairs can only be done slowly; China's affairs must be done bravely. The danger of national extinction does not allow us to be lazy for even a minute. In the future, the speed of revolutionary development will definitely be much faster than in the past because the situation in China and the world is on the eve of a new period of war and revolution. Although this is the case, the Chinese revolutionary war is still a protracted war. The strength of imperialism and the imbalance in the development of the revolution determine this protracted nature. We say that the characteristic of the current situation is the arrival of a new wave of national revolution, China is on the eve of a new national revolution, this is the characteristic of the current revolutionary situation. This is a fact, this is one aspect of the fact. Now we say again, imperialism is still a serious force, the imbalance in the revolutionary forces is a serious flaw, to overthrow the enemy, we must prepare for a protracted war, this is another characteristic of the current revolutionary situation. This is also a fact, this is another aspect of the fact. These two characteristics, these two facts, all come to teach us, requiring us to adapt to the situation, change our strategy, and change the way we mobilize our troops to fight. The current situation requires us to bravely abandon sectarianism, adopt a broad united front, and prevent adventurism. We will not say anything about the relationship between sectarianism and adventurism here, nor will we say anything about the possible dangers of adventurism in the future major situation, we will talk about this later. Here, we only talk about the strategy of the united front and the strategy of sectarianism, which are two completely opposite strategies.

One wants to recruit a large number of troops to surround and annihilate the enemy.

The other relies on lone soldiers to fight hard battles against a strong enemy.

One says, if we do not sufficiently estimate the impact of Japanese imperialism turning China into a colony on the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary lines in China, we cannot sufficiently estimate the possibility of organizing a broad national revolutionary united front. If we do not sufficiently estimate the strengths and weaknesses of Japanese counter-revolutionary forces, Chinese counter-revolutionary forces, and Chinese revolutionary forces, we will not sufficiently estimate the necessity of organizing a broad national revolutionary united front; we will not take decisive measures to break through sectarianism; we will not use the weapon of the united front to organize and unite tens of millions of people and all possible revolutionary allied forces, and attack the most central target, Japanese imperialism and its running dogs, the Chinese traitors; we will not use our strategic weapon to shoot at the most central target at present, but will disperse the target, so that the main enemy is not hit, and even the allied forces are hit by our bullets. This is called not choosing the enemy and wasting ammunition. In this way, we cannot drive the enemy into a narrow and isolated position. In this way, we cannot pull those who were previously enemies but may become allies today from the enemy camp and the enemy line. In this way, we are actually helping the enemy, making the revolution stagnant, isolated, shrinking, declining, and even leading to failure.

The other says, these criticisms are all wrong. The revolutionary forces must be pure and pure again, the revolutionary path must be straight and straight again. Only what is written in the Bible is correct. The national bourgeoisie has been entirely counter-revolutionary forever. We cannot retreat even a step regarding the rich peasants. Regarding the yellow unions, we can only fight to the death. If we shake hands with Cai Tingyang, we must curse him as a counter-revolutionary in the moment of the handshake. Who is not a counter-revolutionary? Who is not a revolutionary? Intellectuals have only three days of revolutionary spirit, recruiting them is dangerous. Therefore, the conclusion: sectarianism is the only magic weapon, the united front is an opportunist strategy.

Comrades, which one is correct, the logic of the united front or the logic of sectarianism? Which one does Marxism-Leninism support? I firmly answer: support the united front, oppose sectarianism. Among people, there are three-year-old children, and three-year-old children have many correct ideas, but they cannot manage the affairs of the world, because they do not understand the logic of the world. Marxism-Leninism opposes infantile diseases in the revolutionary ranks. What those who advocate sectarianist strategies advocate is a set of infantile diseases. The path of revolution, like all activities in the world, is always tortuous, not straight. The revolutionary and counter-revolutionary lines can change, just like everything in the world can change. Japanese imperialism's decision to turn all of China into its colony, and the current serious weaknesses of the Chinese revolutionary forces, these two basic facts are the starting point of the Party's new strategy, that is, the broad united front. Organizing tens of millions of people, mobilizing a vast revolutionary army, is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution. Only with such strength can we defeat Japanese imperialism and the traitorous sellouts, this is a truth that is evident to all. Therefore, only the strategy of the united front is the Marxist-Leninist strategy. The strategy of sectarianism is the strategy of a lone wolf. Sectarianism "drives fish into the deep and birds into the woods," driving "tens of millions" and "vast" to the enemy's side, only earning the enemy's applause. In reality, sectarianism is the loyal servant of Japanese imperialism and the traitorous sellouts. The so-called "purity" and "straightness" of sectarianism are things that Marxism-Leninism slaps in the face, while Japanese imperialism praises them. We must not have sectarianism; we want a national revolutionary united front that will kill Japanese imperialism and the traitorous sellouts.

**People's Republic**

If we say that our past government was a government of the alliance of workers, peasants, and urban petty bourgeoisie, then from now on, it should be changed to include all other classes willing to participate in the national revolution, in addition to workers, peasants, and urban petty bourgeoisie.

At present, the basic task of this government is to resist Japanese imperialism's annexation of China. The composition of this government will expand to a broad scope. Not only those who are only interested in the national revolution but not in the land revolution can participate, but also those who have relations with European and American imperialism, cannot resist European and American imperialism, but can resist Japanese imperialism and its running dogs, as long as they are willing, they can also participate. Therefore, the program of this government should be based on the principle of adapting to the basic task of resisting Japanese imperialism and its running dogs, and appropriately modify our past policies.

Title: The Characteristics of the Present Revolution and the Necessity of Forming a United Front

Page: 1

The distinctive feature of the revolutionary situation today is that we now have a Communist Party that has been tempered through struggle, and a Red Army that has also been tempered through struggle. This is a matter of great importance. If we did not have a tempered Communist Party and Red Army today, we would face immense difficulties. Why? Because there are many traitors and collaborators in China, and they are powerful. They will certainly use every conceivable means to sabotage this united front, using their tactics of coercion, bribery, and manipulation to sow discord, using military force to suppress, and to pick off one by one those forces that are weaker than themselves and willing to break away from the traitors and join us in fighting Japan. If the anti-Japanese government and anti-Japanese army lack the element of the Communist Party and the Red Army, such a situation would be difficult to avoid. The main reason for the failure of the 1927 revolution was the opportunist line within the Communist Party, which did not strive to expand its own forces (the workers' and peasants' movements and the army led by the Communist Party) but relied solely on its temporary ally, the Kuomintang. The result was that imperialism ordered its lackeys, the comprador class, to extend a thousand hands, first pulling Chiang Kai-shek over, then pulling Wang Jingwei over, causing the revolution to fail. At that time, the revolutionary united front had no central pillar, no strong revolutionary armed forces, and was attacked from all sides. The Communist Party had to fight alone and was unable to resist the strategy of imperialism and the Chinese counter-revolutionaries of picking off one by one. At that time, although there was a military force led by He Long and Ye Ting, it was not yet a politically strong army, and the Party was not good at leading it, so it eventually failed. This is a bloody lesson of the failure of the revolution due to the lack of a central revolutionary force. Today, this situation has changed. We now have a strong Communist Party and a strong Red Army, and we have a base area for the Red Army. The Communist Party and the Red Army not only now serve as the initiators of the anti-Japanese national united front but will also certainly become the strong pillars in the future anti-Japanese government and anti-Japanese army, making the policy of sabotage used by Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek against the anti-Japanese national united front unable to achieve its ultimate goal. There is no doubt that Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek will certainly use various tactics of coercion, bribery, and manipulation, and we must be very vigilant.

Of course, we cannot expect every part of the broad forces of the anti-Japanese national united front to be as solid as the Communist Party and the Red Army. In their activities, there will be cases where some bad elements, influenced by the enemy, withdraw from the united front. But we are not afraid of these people leaving. Some bad people influenced by the enemy leave, but some good people influenced by us will join. As long as the Communist Party and the Red Army exist and develop, the anti-Japanese national united front will certainly also exist and develop. This is the leading role of the Communist Party and the Red Army in the national united front. Communist Party members are no longer children; they can handle themselves and can also handle their allies. Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek can use tactics of manipulation to deal with the revolutionary forces, and the Communist Party can also use tactics of manipulation to deal with the counter-revolutionary forces. They can pull away the bad elements from our ranks, and we can certainly pull away the "bad elements" (who are good elements to us) from their ranks. If we can pull more people from their ranks, the enemy's forces will be reduced, and our forces will be expanded. In short, now it is a struggle between two basic forces, and all intermediate forces, if they do not join one side, will join the other. This is a definite principle. And the policy of Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek to destroy and sell out China will inevitably drive many forces to our side, either directly joining the Communist Party and Red Army or forming a united front with the Communist Party and Red Army. As long as our strategy is not sectarian, this goal can be achieved.

Why change the Workers' and Peasants' Republic to the People's Republic?

Our government represents not only the workers and peasants but also the nation. This meaning is already included in the original slogan of the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Republic, because workers and peasants account for 80 to 90 percent of the nation's population. The ten major policies stipulated by the Sixth National Congress of our Party not only represent the interests of workers and peasants but also represent the interests of the nation. However, the current situation requires us to change this slogan to the People's Republic. This is because the situation of Japanese aggression has changed the class relations in China, making it possible for not only the petty bourgeoisie but also the national bourgeoisie to participate in the anti-Japanese struggle.

There is no doubt that the People's Republic does not represent the interests of the opposing classes. On the contrary, the People's Republic is in a position directly opposed to the comprador class, which are the lackeys of imperialism. It does not include these elements in the so-called people. This is the same as Chiang Kai-shek's "National Government of the Republic of China," which only represents the richest of the rich and does not represent the common people, and does not include the common people in the so-called "nation." Eighty to ninety percent of China's population are workers and peasants, so the People's Republic should first represent the interests of workers and peasants. However, the People's Republic, by eliminating the oppression of imperialism, making China free and independent, and eliminating the oppression of landlords, making China free from semi-feudalism, these actions not only benefit workers and peasants but also benefit other people. In summary, the interests of workers, peasants, and other people constitute the interests of the Chinese nation. The comprador class and the landlord class, although they live on Chinese soil, do not care about the interests of the nation, and their interests are in conflict with the interests of the majority. We only exclude these few people and only conflict with these few people, so we have the right to call ourselves representatives of the entire nation.

The interests of the working class are also in conflict with the interests of the national bourgeoisie. To carry out the national revolution, it is necessary to give the vanguard of the national revolution political and economic rights, so that the working class can exert its strength to deal with imperialism and its lackeys, the traitors. However, if the national bourgeoisie participates in the united front against imperialism, then the working class and the national bourgeoisie will have common interests. The People's Republic, in the era of the bourgeois democratic revolution, does not abolish non-imperialist, non-feudal private property, does not confiscate the industries and commerce of the national bourgeoisie, and even encourages the development of these industries and commerce. Any national capitalist, as long as he does not support imperialism and Chinese traitors, we will protect him. In the stage of the democratic revolution, the struggle between labor and capital is limited. The labor laws of the People's Republic protect the interests of workers but do not oppose the enrichment of national capitalists and do not oppose the development of national industries and commerce, because such development is not beneficial to imperialism but beneficial to the Chinese people. From this, it can be seen: the People's Republic represents the interests of all classes that oppose imperialism and feudalism. The government of the People's Republic is based on workers and peasants, while also accommodating other classes that oppose imperialism and feudalism.

Will it be dangerous to let these people participate in the government of the People's Republic? It will not be dangerous. Workers and peasants are the basic masses of this republic. Giving the urban petty bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and other elements who support the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal program the right to speak and act in the government of the People's Republic, and giving them the right to vote and be elected, will not violate the interests of the basic masses of workers and peasants. The important part of our program should protect the interests of the basic masses of workers and peasants. The representatives of the basic masses of workers and peasants in the government of the People's Republic occupy the majority, and the leadership and activities of the Communist Party in this government guarantee that they will not be dangerous to come in. The current stage of the Chinese revolution is still a bourgeois democratic revolution, not a proletarian socialist revolution, which is very clear. Only the counter-revolutionary Trotskyism blindly says that China has completed the bourgeois democratic revolution, and the next revolution is only a socialist revolution. The revolution from 1924 to 1927 was a bourgeois democratic revolution, and this revolution did not succeed but failed. From 1927 to the present, the land revolution we led is also a bourgeois democratic revolution, because the task of the revolution is to oppose imperialism and feudalism, not to oppose capitalism. In the future, for a considerable period, the revolution will still be the same.

The driving force of the revolution is still basically the workers, peasants, and urban petty bourgeoisie, and now it is possible to add a national bourgeoisie.

The transformation of the revolution is a matter for the future. In the future, the democratic revolution will inevitably transform into a socialist revolution. When to transform, it should be based on whether the conditions for transformation are met, and it will take a considerable amount of time. Until the time when all the necessary political and economic conditions are met, and until the time when the transformation is beneficial to the vast majority of the people in the country and not harmful, we should not lightly talk about transformation. To doubt this and hope to transform in a very short time, as some comrades said in the past, that the day the democratic revolution begins to win in important provinces is the day the revolution begins to transform, is wrong. This is because they do not see what kind of political and economic situation China is in, they do not know that China's completion of the democratic revolution is much more difficult than Russia's and requires more time and effort.

International Aid

Finally, we need to talk a bit about the relationship between the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

Since the birth of imperialism, the world has become interconnected, and it is impossible to separate it. We, the Chinese nation, have the spirit to fight to the death with our enemies, the determination to restore the old on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand independently among the nations of the world. However, this does not mean that we do not need international aid; no, international aid is necessary for the revolutionary struggles of all countries and nations in the modern world. The ancients said: "In the Spring and Autumn Period, there were no just wars." Today, imperialism is even more without just wars, only the oppressed nations and oppressed classes have just wars. All the wars of the people of the world rising up against the oppressors are just wars. The February Revolution and the October Revolution in Russia are just wars. The revolutions of the European peoples after World War I are just wars. China's Opium War, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom War, the Boxer Rebellion, the Xinhai Revolution, the Northern Expedition from 1926 to 1927, the land revolution from 1927 to the present, and today's anti-Japanese and anti-traitor war are all just wars. In the current high tide of anti-Japanese resistance in all of China and the high tide of anti-fascism in the world, just wars will spread throughout China and the world. All just wars are mutually supportive, and all unjust wars should be transformed into just wars, this is the line of Leninism. Our anti-Japanese war needs the aid of the people of the world, first of all, the aid of the Soviet people, and they will certainly aid us, because we and they are closely related. In the past period, the revolutionary forces of China and the international revolutionary forces were cut off by Chiang Kai-shek, and in this sense, we were isolated. Now this situation has changed, and it has changed in our favor. In the future, this situation will continue to change in our favor. We will not be isolated. This is a necessary condition for the victory of the Chinese anti-Japanese war and the Chinese revolution.

Annotations:

[1] Yuan Shikai was the leader of the Beiyang warlords at the end of the Qing Dynasty. After the 1911 revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty, he relied on counter-revolutionary military force and the support of imperialism, and also took advantage of the compromising nature of the revolutionary leadership of the bourgeoisie, to seize the presidency and establish the first Beiyang warlord government representing the large landlords and comprador class. In 1915, he wanted to become emperor, and in order to gain the support of Japanese imperialism, he acknowledged Japan's Twenty-One Demands aimed at monopolizing China. In December of the same year, a rebellion against Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor broke out in Yunnan, and it quickly spread to other places. Yuan Shikai died in Beijing in June 1916.

[2] On January 18, 1915, Japanese imperialism presented the Twenty-One Demands to the Yuan Shikai government of China, and on May 7, it presented an ultimatum, setting a 48-hour deadline for a response. The full text of the demands consisted of five parts: the first four parts included the transfer of the rights seized by Germany in Shandong and the demand for additional rights for Japan in Shandong, the right to lease or own land in South Manchuria and Eastern Mongolia, the right to reside, the right to engage in commerce and industry, the exclusive right to build railways and mine minerals, the transformation of the Hanyeping Company into a Sino-Japanese joint venture, and the prohibition of leasing coastal ports and islands to third countries, etc.; the fifth part listed items aimed at seizing the political, financial, police, and military powers to control China, and also sought to seize the right to build important railways between Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong. Yuan Shikai agreed to all but the fifth part, which he stated would be "negotiated later." However, due to the unanimous opposition of the Chinese people, Japan's demands were not implemented.

[3] In November 1921, the U.S. government convened representatives from China, Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Japan, plus the U.S., making a total of nine countries, in Washington for a conference. This was a conference between the U.S. and Japan to compete for hegemony in the Far East. On February 6 of the following year, based on the U.S. so-called "equal opportunities for all countries in China" and "open door policy," the Nine-Power Treaty was signed. The effect of the Nine-Power Treaty was to create a situation where imperialist powers jointly controlled China and, in practice, prepared for U.S. imperialism to monopolize China, to eliminate Japan's plan to monopolize China.

[4] On September 18, 1931, the so-called "Kwantung Army" of Japan stationed in Northeast China attacked Shenyang. At that time, the Chinese army stationed in Shenyang and other places in Northeast China (Northeast Army) received Chiang Kai-shek's order of "absolute non-resistance" and retreated south of the Shanhaiguan Pass, allowing the Japanese army to quickly occupy Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces. The Chinese people habitually refer to this act of aggression by the Japanese invaders as the "September 18 Incident."

[5] The four provinces of Northeast China refer to Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe provinces in the northeastern part of China at that time, roughly corresponding to the six provinces of Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, and Rehe in the current Northeast Administrative Region, as well as most of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. After the September 18 Incident, the Japanese invaders first occupied Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, and in 1933, they also invaded Rehe.

[6] On November 25, 1935, Japan incited the Kuomintang traitor Yin Rugeng to establish a puppet government in 22 counties in eastern Hebei province, named the "East Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Government." This was the East Hebei Incident.

[7] Diplomatic negotiations refer to the negotiations at that time between the Chiang Kai-shek government and the Japanese government regarding the so-called "Konoe Three Principles." The "Konoe Three Principles" were proposed by Konoe Fumimaro, the then Japanese Foreign Minister, and their content was: 1. China to suppress all anti-Japanese movements; 2. Establish Sino-Japanese-Manchurian economic cooperation; 3. Sino-Japanese joint anti-communism. On January 21, 1936, Konoe said in a speech to the Japanese Diet: "The Chinese government has already acknowledged the three principles proposed by the Empire."

[8] When Comrade Mao Zedong made this report, Chiang Kai-shek was continuing his trick of selling out Northeast China and was also selling out North China and continuing to actively fight against the Red Army. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party must expose Chiang Kai-shek's true face as a traitor to the country; and therefore, the anti-Japanese national united front proposed by the Chinese Communist Party at this time did not include Chiang Kai-shek. However, Comrade Mao Zedong already mentioned in this report that the contradictions among the imperialists might cause a split within the camp of the Chinese comprador class. Later, due to the Japanese imperialists' attack on North China, which seriously conflicted with the interests of British and American imperialism, the Chinese Communist Party believed that the Chiang Kai-shek faction, which was closely linked to the interests of British and American imperialism, might change its attitude towards Japan under the orders of its masters, and thus adopted a policy of pressing Chiang Kai-shek to turn to anti-Japanese resistance. In May 1936, the Red Army returned to Shaanxi from Shanxi, directly demanding that the Nationalist Government in Nanjing stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan. In August of the same year, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent another letter to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, proposing to form a united front of the two parties to resist Japan and sent representatives for negotiations. But Chiang Kai-shek still refused the proposal of the Communist Party. It was not until December 1936, when Chiang Kai-shek was detained by the Kuomintang military who advocated uniting with the Communists to resist Japan, that he was forced to accept the Communist Party's demand to stop the civil war and prepare to resist Japan.

[9] Cai Tingkai was a military commander of the Nineteenth Route Army of the Kuomintang, also serving as the deputy commander of the army. The army was originally fighting against the Red Army in Jiangxi and was transferred to Shanghai after the September 18 Incident. At that time, the anti-Japanese high tide in Shanghai and throughout the country had a great impact on the Nineteenth Route Army. On the night of January 28, 1932, the Japanese naval landing forces attacked Shanghai, and the Nineteenth Route Army and the people of Shanghai fought together. However, this war later failed due to the betrayal of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei. Subsequently, the Nineteenth Route Army was sent by Chiang Kai-shek to Fujian to fight against the Red Army. At this time, the leaders of the Nineteenth Route Army gradually realized that fighting against the Red Army was a dead end. In November 1933, the leaders of the Nineteenth Route Army, together with part of the forces of Li Jishen and others within the Kuomintang, openly broke with Chiang Kai-shek. They established the "People's Revolutionary Government of the Republic of China" in Fujian Province and signed an anti-Japanese, anti-Chiang agreement with the Red Army. The Nineteenth Route Army and the Fujian People's Government failed under the pressure of Chiang Kai-shek's military forces. Later, Cai Tingkai and others gradually shifted to a position of cooperation with the Communist Party.

[10] In September 1926, when the revolutionary army of the Northern Expedition reached Wuhan, Feng Yuxiang led his army to announce its withdrawal from the Beiyang warlord system and join the revolution in Suiyuan Province. In early 1927, his army set out from Shaanxi and, together with the Northern Expeditionary Army, attacked Henan Province. After Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei betrayed the revolution in 1927, Feng Yuxiang also participated in the anti-Communist activities, but there was always a conflict of interests between him and the Chiang Kai-shek faction. After the September 18 Incident, he advocated resistance against Japan and, in May 1933, cooperated with the Communist Party to organize the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in Zhangjiakou. Due to the dual pressure of Chiang Kai-shek's forces and the Japanese invaders, this anti-Japanese uprising failed in August. Feng Yuxiang continued to adopt a cooperative stance with the Communist Party in his later years.

[11] The Twenty-Sixth Route Army of the Kuomintang was sent by Chiang Kai-shek to Jiangxi to attack the Red Army. In December 1931, more than ten thousand of its soldiers, led by comrades Zhao Boshen and Dong Zhenxiang, responded to the Communist Party's call to resist Japan and rebelled in Ningdu, Jiangxi, joining the Red Army.

[12] Ma Zhanxiang was originally an officer of the Northeast Army. His troops were stationed in Heilongjiang. When the Japanese invaders advanced from Liaoning to Heilongjiang after the September 18 Incident, his troops put up resistance.

[13] Hu Hanmin was a famous politician of the Kuomintang. He opposed Sun Yat-sen's policy of cooperating with the Communist Party and was a co-conspirator in Chiang Kai-shek's April 12 counter-revolutionary coup in 1927. Later, due to a power struggle with Chiang, he was imprisoned by Chiang. After the September 18 Incident, he was released and went from Nanjing to Guangzhou, inciting the military forces of the Guangdong and Guangxi warlords to form a long-term opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's Nanjing government.

[14] The "Six Great Principles for Anti-Japanese National Salvation" is the "Basic Program for the Chinese People's War Against Japan," proposed by the Chinese Communist Party in 1934 and published with the signatures of Song Qingling and others. The program includes the following items: (1) Full mobilization of the army, navy, and air force to fight against Japan; (2) Full mobilization of the people; (3) Full arming of the people; (4) Seizure of the property of Japanese imperialism and traitors in China to solve the expenses of the anti-Japanese war; (5) Establishment of a National Defense Committee elected by representatives of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants; (6) Alliance with all enemies of Japanese imperialism as friendly forces and establishment of friendly relations with all neutral countries with good intentions.

[15] The Guangdong and Guangxi warlords refer to Chen Jitang of Guangdong, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi of Guangxi.

[16] The Chiang Kai-shek gang calls revolutionary people "bandits" and calls their own actions of attacking and massacring revolutionary people "bandit suppression."

[17] Comrade Ren Bishi, one of the earliest members and organizers of the Chinese Communist Party. Since the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1927, he has been elected as a member of the Central Committee at each party congress. At the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in 1931, he was elected as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. In 1933, Comrade Ren Bishi served as the Secretary of the Hunan-Jiangxi Provincial Committee and the Political Commissar of the Sixth Army Group of the Red Army. After the Sixth Army Group merged with the Second Army Group, Comrade Ren Bishi served as the Political Commissar of the Second and Sixth Army Groups, which formed the Second Front Army. During the early period of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the Director of the Political Department of the Eighth Route Army. In 1940, he participated in the work of the Secretariat of the Central Committee. In 1945, at the First Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, he was elected as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee. He passed away in Beijing on October 27, 1950.

[18] The Sixth Army Group of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was originally stationed in the Hunan-Jiangxi border revolutionary base area. In July 1934, it received the order of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to break through and transfer. In October of the same year, it merged with the Second Army Group led by Comrade He Long in eastern Guizhou, forming the Second Front Army and opening up the revolutionary base area in Hunan-Hubei-Hunan-Guizhou.

[19] In October 1934, the First, Third, and Fifth Army Groups of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (the First Front Army) set out from Longtian and Ningyuan in western Fujian and Yugan in southern Jiangxi, beginning a strategic large-scale transfer. The Red Army passed through Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, Xikang, Gansu, and Shaanxi, a total of eleven provinces, crossing snow-capped mountains all year round, and crossing grasslands where few people have set foot, enduring hardships, breaking through the enemy's repeated encirclement and pursuit, marching continuously for 25,000 li (12,500 kilometers), and finally arrived in the revolutionary base area in northern Shaanxi in October 1935.

[20] The Red Army in the Sichuan-Shaanxi border area, the Fourth Front Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. In March 1935, the Fourth Front Army left the Sichuan-Shaanxi border revolutionary base area and transferred to the border area of Sichuan and Xikang provinces. In June of the same year, it merged with the First Front Army in the western part of Sichuan, forming the left and right two armies to march north, and arrived near Mogu in Songpan in September of the same year. At this time, Zhang Guotao, who was working in the Fourth Front Army, disobeyed the order of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and arbitrarily led the left army to retreat to the minority areas between Sichuan and Tibet, splitting the Red Army. It was not until June 1936 that the Second Front Army broke through from the Hunan-Hubei-Guizhou border area, passing through Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, and arrived in Kangding, Xikang, merging with the Fourth Front Army. The comrades of the Fourth Front Army went against the will of Zhang Guotao and, together with the Second Front Army, made the northward transfer. In November of the same year, the entire Second Front Army and part of the Fourth Front Army arrived in Shaanbei, merging with the First Front Army.

[21] Zhang Guotao, a traitor to the Chinese revolution. He joined the Chinese Communist Party by taking advantage of the revolution. He made many mistakes in the party and committed great crimes. His most notable mistake was in 1935, when he opposed the Red Army's northward march and advocated that the Red Army retreat to the minority areas between Sichuan and Tibet, a defeatist and liquidationist policy, and carried out open anti-party and anti-Central Committee treasonous activities, establishing a false Central Committee, destroying the unity of the party and the Red Army, causing the Fourth Front Army to suffer heavy losses. The Fourth Front Army and its broad cadre, under the patient education of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the party, quickly returned to the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the party and played a glorious role in the subsequent struggle; but Zhang Guotao himself was ultimately beyond redemption and, in the spring of 1938, fled alone from the Shaan-Gan-Ning border area and joined the Kuomintang intelligence group.

[22] The Central Red Army refers to the Red Army that developed in the Jiangxi-Fujian area and was directly led by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the First Front Army.

[23] In July 1935, the Kuomintang army began the third "encirclement and suppression" of the Shaan-Gan revolutionary base area. The Red Army in Shaanbei, the Twenty-Sixth Army, first defeated two enemy brigades on the eastern line, driving the enemy on this line to the east bank of the Yellow River. In September of the same year, the Twenty-Fifth Army, originally in the E-Yu-Hu revolutionary base area, arrived in Shaanbei via Shaanxi and Longdong, merging with the Red Army in Shaanbei and forming the Fifteenth Army Group. The Fifteenth Army Group annihilated most of the 110th Division of the enemy in the battle of Laoyuan Mountain in Gansu, killing its division commander, and soon annihilated four battalions of the 107th Division of the enemy at Yulin Bridge in Gansu. The enemy then reorganized the attack, with Dong Yingbin (a military commander of the Northeast Army) leading five divisions in two routes. The eastern route, one division, advanced north along the road from Luochuan to Fuxian, and the western route, four divisions, advanced from Qingyang and Heshui in Gansu along the Hulu River to the direction of Fuxian in Shaanbei. In October of the same year, the Central Red Army arrived in Shaanbei. In November, the Central Red Army and the Fifteenth Army Group jointly annihilated the 109th Division of the enemy at Zhi Luo Town southwest of Fuxian, and then annihilated a regiment of the 106th Division of the enemy at Heishuisi during the pursuit. In this way, the enemy's third "encirclement and suppression" of the Shaan-Gan base area was thoroughly smashed.

[24] During the transfer of the main forces of the southern Red Army from 1934 to 1935, a part of the guerrilla forces were left behind. These guerrilla forces, in eight provinces, persisted in guerrilla warfare in fourteen areas. These areas are: the Zhejiang South area, the Fujian North area, the Fujian East area, the Jiangxi Northeast area, the Fujian South area, the Fujian West area, the Fujian-Jiangxi border area, the Guangdong-Jiangxi border area, the Hunan South area, the Hunan-Jiangxi border area, the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border area, the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border area, the Henan South Tongbai Mountain area, and the Hainan area of Guangdong Province.

[25] After Japan occupied Northeast China in 1931, the Chinese Communist Party called on the people to take up arms and resist, organizing anti-Japanese guerrilla forces and the Northeast People's Revolutionary Army, and aiding various forms of anti-Japanese volunteer armies. After 1934, all anti-Japanese forces in Northeast China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, were united into the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, with the famous Communist Party member Yang Jingyu as the commander-in-chief, and persisted in the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare in Northeast China for a long time. The anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare in Suide refers to the peasant uprising that occurred in eastern Hebei Province in May 1935.

[26] The revolutionary war led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union refers to the war from 1918 to 1920 in which the Soviet people resisted the armed intervention of Britain, the United States, France, Japan, and other imperialist countries and suppressed the White Guard rebellion.

[27] The nature of the political power and various policies of the People's Republic proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong here were fully realized in the liberated areas led by the Communist Party during the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, the Communist Party was able to lead the people to fight a victorious war against the Japanese invaders in the rear. After the surrender of Japan, the Third Civil War broke out, and with the progress of the war, the liberated areas gradually expanded to the whole of China, thus forming a unified People's Republic of China. The ideal of the People's Republic proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong was realized throughout the country.

[28] At the Sixth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party held in July 1928, the following ten major policies were stipulated: 1. Overthrow the rule of imperialism; 2. Confiscate the enterprises and banks of foreign capital; 3. Unify China and recognize the right of national self-determination; 4. Overthrow the government of the Kuomintang warlords; 5. Establish a government of workers', peasants', and soldiers' congresses; 6. Implement the eight-hour workday, increase wages, unemployment relief, and social insurance, etc.; 7. Confiscate all the land of the landlord class and give the land to the tiller; 8. Improve the living conditions of soldiers, give soldiers land and work; 9. Abolish all taxes imposed by the government, warlords, and local authorities, and implement a unified progressive tax; 10. Unite with the world proletariat and the Soviet Union.

[29] The Trotskyist group was originally a faction in the Russian workers' movement that opposed Leninism, but it later degenerated into a completely counter-revolutionary gang. About the evolution of this traitor group, Comrade Stalin explained in his report to the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1937 as follows: "In the past, seven or eight years ago, Trotskyism was a faction in the working class, although it was an anti-Leninist and therefore extremely erroneous faction, it was still a faction. ... Today's Trotskyism is not a faction in the working class, but a gang of unprincipled, thoughtless, assassins, military saboteurs, spies, and murderers, agents of foreign intelligence." After the failure of the Chinese revolution in 1927, a few Trotskyites also appeared in China. They joined forces with the traitors Chen Duxiu and others and formed a counter-revolutionary small organization in 1929, spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda such as the Kuomintang had completed the bourgeois democratic revolution, and were completely the vile tools of imperialism and the Kuomintang. The Trotskyites in China openly joined the Kuomintang intelligence agencies. After the September 18 Incident, they accepted the order of the Trotskyite bandit "not to obstruct the occupation of China by Japanese imperialism" and cooperated with the Japanese intelligence agencies, receiving subsidies from the Japanese invaders, and engaging in various activities beneficial to the Japanese invaders.

[30] "There are no just wars in the Spring and Autumn Period," from "Mencius." In the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC), the feudal lords of China were constantly fighting each other for power and profit, so Mencius said this.

[31] From 1840 to 1842, Britain, due to the opposition of the Chinese people to the opium trade, used the pretext of protecting trade to send troops to invade China. The Chinese army, under the leadership of Lin Zexu, had put up resistance. At that time, the people of Guangzhou spontaneously organized the "Anti-British Corps," which also dealt a heavy blow to the British invaders.

[32] The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom War was a peasant revolutionary war against the Manchu Qing Dynasty and national oppression that took place in the mid-19th century. In January 1851, the leaders of the revolution, Hong Xiuquan, Yang Xiuqing, and others, rose up in Jintian Village, Guiping County, Guangxi, and declared the establishment of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." In 1852, they marched out of Guangxi, through Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, and captured Nanjing in 1853. Subsequently, a part of the troops marched north from Nanjing and reached the outskirts of Tianjin. However, the Taiping Army did not establish a solid base in the areas it occupied, and after establishing the capital in Nanjing, its leadership made many political and military mistakes, so it could not resist the counter-revolutionary army of the Qing Dynasty and the joint attack of the British, French, and American invaders, and failed in 1864.

[33] The Boxer Rebellion was a spontaneous mass movement of peasants and artisans in northern China in 1900, taking the form of a secret society with mystical beliefs, to resist imperialism. The combined armed forces of eight imperialist countries occupied Beijing and Tianjin and brutally suppressed this movement.

　　论反对日本帝国主义的策略
    （一九三五年十二月二十七日）
    毛泽东
    这是毛泽东同志在陕北瓦窑堡党的活动分子会议上所作的报告。毛泽东同志的这个报告是在一九三五年十二月中共中央政治局瓦窑堡会议之后作的。这一次政治局会议批评了党内那种认为中国民族资产阶级不可能和中国工人农民联合抗日的错误观点，决定了建立民族统一战线的策略，是一次极关重要的中央会议。毛泽东同志根据中央决议在这里充分地说明了和民族资产阶级在抗日的条件下重新建立统一战线的可能性和重要性，着重地指出共产党和红军在这个统一战线中的具有决定意义的领导作用，指出了中国革命的长期性，批判了党内在过去长时期内存在着的狭隘的关门主义和对于革命的急性病——这些是党和红军在第二次国内革命战争时期遭受严重挫折的基本原因。同时，毛泽东同志唤起党内注意一九二七年陈独秀右倾机会主义引导革命归于失败的历史教训，指出了蒋介石必然要破坏革命势力的趋势，这样就保证了后来我党在新环境中能够具有清醒的头脑，在蒋介石的无穷欺骗和很多次的武装袭击中，使革命力量不致遭受损失。一九三五年一月党中央在贵州遵义举行的政治局扩大会议，建立了以毛泽东同志为首的新的中央的领导，改变了过去“左”倾机会主义的领导。但那次会议是在红军长征途中召集的，所以只能够对于当时最迫切的军事问题和中央书记处、中央革命军事委员会的组织问题做了决议。红军长征到达陕北之后，党中央才获得可能去有系统地说明政治策略上的诸问题。对于这类政治策略上的问题，毛泽东同志的这篇报告作了最完整的分析。

            目前政治形势的特点
    同志们！目前的政治形势已经发生了很大的变化。根据这种变化了的形势，我们的党已经规定了自己的任务。
    目前的形势是怎样的呢？
    目前形势的基本特点，就是日本帝国主义要变中国为它的殖民地。
    大家知道，差不多一百年以来，中国是好几个帝国主义国家共同支配的半殖民地的国家。由于中国人民对帝国主义的斗争和帝国主义国家相互间的斗争，使得中国还保存了一种半独立的地位。第一次世界大战曾经在一个时期内给了日本帝国主义以独霸中国的机会。但是中国人民反对日本帝国主义的斗争，以及其他帝国主义国家的干涉，使得经过那时的卖国头子袁世凯〔一〕签了字的对日屈服投降的条约二十一条〔二〕，不得不宣告无效。一九二二年美国召集的华盛顿九国会议签订了一个公约〔三〕，又使中国回复到几个帝国主义国家共同支配的局面。但是没有很久，这种情况又起了变化。一九三一年九月十八日的事变〔四〕，开始了变中国为日本殖民地的阶段。只是日本侵略的范围暂时还限于东北四省〔五〕，就使人们觉得似乎日本帝国主义者不一定再前进了的样子。今天不同了，日本帝国主义者已经显示他们要向中国本部前进了，他们要占领全中国。现在是日本帝国主义要把整个中国从几个帝国主义国家都有份的半殖民地状态改变为日本独占的殖民地状态。最近的冀东事变〔六〕和外交谈判〔七〕，显示了这个方向，威胁到了全国人民的生存。这种情形，就给中国一切阶级和一切政治派别提出了“怎么办”的问题。反抗呢？还是投降呢？或者游移于两者之间呢？
    现在，我们来看一看中国各个阶级怎样来回答这个问题。
    中国的工人和农民都是要求反抗的。一九二四年至一九二七年的革命，一九二七年至现在的土地革命，一九三一年九一八事变以来的反日浪潮，证明中国工人阶级和农民阶级是中国革命的最坚决的力量。
    中国的小资产阶级也是要反抗的。青年学生和城市小资产阶级，现在不是已经发动了一个广大的反日运动么？中国的这些小资产阶级成份曾经参加过一九二四年至一九二七年的革命。和农民一样，他们有同帝国主义势不两立的小生产的经济地位。帝国主义和中国反革命势力，曾经给了他们以重大的损害，使他们中的很多人陷于失业、破产或半破产的境地。现在他们眼看就要当亡国奴了，除了反抗，再没有出路。
    问题摆在民族资产阶级、买办阶级和地主阶级面前，摆在国民党面前，又是怎样的呢？
    大土豪、大劣绅、大军阀、大官僚、大买办们的主意早就打定了。他们过去是、现在仍然是在说：革命（不论什么革命）总比帝国主义坏。他们组成了一个卖国贼营垒，在他们面前没有什么当不当亡国奴的问题，他们已经撤去了民族的界线，他们的利益同帝国主义的利益是不可分离的，他们的总头子就是蒋介石〔八〕。这一卖国贼营垒是中国人民的死敌。假如没有这一群卖国贼，日本帝国主义是不可能放肆到这种田地的。他们是帝国主义的走狗。
    民族资产阶级是一个复杂的问题。这个阶级曾经参加过一九二四年至一九二七年的革命，随后又为这个革命的火焰所吓坏，站到人民的敌人即蒋介石集团那一方面去了。问题是在今天的情况下，民族资产阶级有没有发生变化的可能性呢？我们认为是有这种可能性的。这是因为民族资产阶级同地主阶级、买办阶级不是同一的东西，他们之间是有分别的。民族资产阶级没有地主阶级那样多的封建性，没有买办阶级那样多的买办性。民族资产阶级内部有同外国资本和本国土地关系较多的一部分人，这一部分人是民族资产阶级的右翼，我们暂且不去估计他们的变化的可能性。问题是在没有那些关系或者关系较少的那些部分。我们认为在殖民地化威胁的新环境之下，民族资产阶级的这些部分的态度可能发生变化。这个变化的特点就是他们的动摇。他们一方面不喜欢帝国主义，一方面又怕革命的彻底性，他们在这二者之间动摇着。这就说明，在一九二四年至一九二七年的革命时期他们为什么参加了革命，及到这一时期之末，他们又为什么站到蒋介石方面去了。现在的时期，同一九二七年蒋介石叛变革命的时期有什么分别呢？那时的中国还是一个半殖民地。现在，正在走向殖民地。九年以来，他们抛弃了自己的同盟者工人阶级，和地主买办阶级做朋友，得了什么好处没有呢？没有什么好处，得到的只不过是民族工商业的破产或半破产的境遇。因为这些情况，我们认为民族资产阶级的态度，在今天的时局下，有起变化的可能性。变化的程度怎样呢？总的特点是动摇。但在斗争的某些阶段，他们中间的一部分（左翼）是有参加斗争的可能的。其另一部分，则有由动摇而采取中立态度的可能。
    蔡廷锴等人领导的十九路军〔九〕是代表什么阶级的利益呢？他们是代表着民族资产阶级、上层小资产阶级、乡村的富农和小地主。蔡廷锴们不是同红军打过死仗的吗？可是后来又同红军订立了抗日反蒋同盟。他们在江西，向红军进攻；到了上海，又抵抗日本帝国主义；到了福建，便同红军成立了妥协，向蒋介石开起火来。无论蔡廷锴们将来的事业是什么，无论当时福建人民政府怎样还是守着老一套不去发动民众斗争，但是他们把本来向着红军的火力掉转去向着日本帝国主义和蒋介石，不能不说是有益于革命的行为。这是国民党营垒的破裂。九一八事变以后的环境能够使国民党营垒分裂出这样一部分人，为什么今天的环境反倒不能造成国民党的分裂呢？我们党内持这样一种论点的人是不对的，他们说，整个地主资产阶级的营垒是统一的，固定的，任何情况下也不能使它起变化。他们不但不认识今天的严重环境，并且连历史也忘记了。
    让我再讲一点历史。一九二六年和一九二七年，当着革命军向武汉前进，以至打到武汉、打到河南的时候，发生了唐生智、冯玉祥〔一○〕参加革命的事情。冯玉祥于一九三三年在察哈尔还曾经和共产党一度合作，建立了抗日同盟军。
    再一个明显的例子，就是曾经和十九路军一道进攻江西红军的第二十六路军，不是在一九三一年十二月举行了宁都起义〔一一〕，变成了红军吗？宁都起义的领导者赵博生、董振堂等人成了坚决革命的同志。
    马占山在东三省的抗日行为〔一二〕，也是统治者营垒中的一个分裂。
    所有这些例子都指明：在日本炸弹的威力圈及于全中国的时候，在斗争改变常态而突然以汹涌的阵势向前推进的时候，敌人的营垒是会发生破裂的。
    同志们，现在让我们把问题转到另一点。
    如果有人拿中国民族资产阶级在政治上经济上的软弱性这一点来反对我们的论点，认为中国民族资产阶级虽然处在新环境，还是没有改变态度的可能，这种说法对不对呢？我认为也是不对的。如果不能改变态度的原因，是民族资产阶级的软弱性，那末，一九二四年至一九二七年为什么改变了他们的常态，不是动摇，简直是参加了革命呢？难道民族资产阶级的软弱性是后来才得的新毛病，而不是他们从娘肚子里带出来的老毛病吗？难道今天软弱，那时就不软弱吗？半殖民地的政治和经济的主要特点之一，就是民族资产阶级的软弱性。正是因为这样，帝国主义敢于欺负他们，而这也就规定了他们不喜欢帝国主义的特点。自然，我们不但不否认，并且完全承认，又是因为这一点，帝国主义和地主买办阶级容易拿某种临时的贿赂为钓饵将他们拉了过去，而这也就规定了他们对于革命的不彻底性。可是总不能说，在今天的情况下，他们同地主阶级和买办阶级没有任何的分别。
    所以我们着重地指出：国民党营垒中，在民族危机到了严重关头的时候，是要发生破裂的。这种破裂，表现于民族资产阶级的动摇，表现于冯玉祥、蔡廷锴、马占山等风头一时的抗日人物。这种情况，基本地说来是不利于反革命，而有利于革命的。由于中国政治经济的不平衡，以及由此而生的革命发展的不平衡，增大了这种破裂的可能性。
    同志们！这个问题的正面，已经说完了。让我再来说一说它的反面，那就是民族资产阶级的某些分子常常是欺骗民众的好手这样一个问题。为什么？因为他们中间除了那些真正拥护人民革命事业的人们而外，有许多人在一个时期内能够以革命的或半革命的或假革命的面目出现，所以他们同时就具备着欺骗民众的资格，使得民众不容易认识他们的不彻底性以及装模作样的假相。这就增加了共产党批评同盟者、揭破假革命、争取领导权的责任。如果我们否认民族资产阶级在大震动中有动摇及参加革命的可能性，那也就取消了至少也减低了我们党对于争取领导权的任务。因为，如果民族资产阶级是同地主买办一模一样，以卖国贼的狰狞面孔出现，争取领导权的任务就大可取消，至少也可以减轻了。
    在整个地分析中国地主资产阶级在大震动中的姿态时，还有一个方面应该指出，那就是：即使在地主买办阶级营垒中也不是完全统一的。这是半殖民地的环境，即许多帝国主义争夺中国的环境所造成的。当斗争是向着日本帝国主义的时候，美国以至英国的走狗们是有可能遵着其主人的叱声的轻重，同日本帝国主义者及其走狗暗斗以至明争的。过去这种狗打架的事情多得很，我们不去说它。于今只说被蒋介石禁闭过的国民党政客胡汉民〔一三〕，不久以前也签名于我们所提出的抗日救国六大纲领的文件〔一四〕。胡汉民所依托的两广派军阀〔一五〕，也在所谓“收复失地”和“抗日剿匪〔一六〕并重”（蒋介石的是“先剿匪，后抗日”）的欺骗口号之下，同蒋介石形成了对立。你们看，不是有点奇怪吗？并不奇怪，这不过是大狗小狗饱狗饿狗之间的一点特别有趣的争斗，一个不大不小的缺口，一种又痒又痛的矛盾。但是这点争斗，这个缺口，这种矛盾，对于革命的人民却是有用的。我们要把敌人营垒中间的一切争斗、缺口、矛盾，统统收集起来，作为反对当前主要敌人之用。
    把这个阶级关系问题总起来说，就是：在日本帝国主义打进中国本部来了这一个基本的变化上面，变化了中国各阶级之间的相互关系，扩大了民族革命营垒的势力，减弱了民族反革命营垒的势力。
    现在我们来说中国民族革命营垒里的情形。
    首先是红军的情形。同志们，你们看，差不多一年半以来，中国的三支主力红军都在作阵地的大转移。从去年八月任弼时同志〔一七〕等率领第六军团向贺龙同志的地方开始转移〔一八〕起，接着就是十月开始的我们的转移〔一九〕。今年三月，川陕边区的红军也开始转移〔二○〕。这三支红军，都放弃了原有阵地转移到新地区去。这个大转移，使得旧区域变为游击区。在转移中，红军本身又有很大的削弱。如果我们拿着整个局面中的这一方面来看，敌人是得到了暂时的部分的胜利，我们是遭遇了暂时的部分的失败。这种说法对不对呢？我以为是对的，因为这是事实。但是有人说（例如张国焘〔二一〕）：中央红军〔二二〕失败了。这话对不对呢？不对。因为这不是事实。马克思主义者看问题，不但要看到部分，而且要看到全体。一个虾蟆坐在井里说：“天有一个井大。”这是不对的，因为天不止一个井大。如果它说：“天的某一部分有一个井大。”这是对的，因为合乎事实。我们说，红军在一个方面（保持原有阵地的方面）说来是失败了，在另一个方面（完成长征计划的方面）说来是胜利了。敌人在一个方面（占领我军原有阵地的方面）说来是胜利了，在另一个方面（实行“围剿”“追剿”计划的方面）说来是失败了。这样说才是恰当的，因为我们完成了长征。
    讲到长征，请问有什么意义呢？我们说，长征是历史纪录上的第一次，长征是宣言书，长征是宣传队，长征是播种机。自从盘古开天地，三皇五帝到于今，历史上曾经有过我们这样的长征么？十二个月光阴中间，天上每日几十架飞机侦察轰炸，地下几十万大军围追堵截，路上遇着了说不尽的艰难险阻，我们却开动了每人的两只脚，长驱二万余里，纵横十一个省。请问历史上曾有过我们这样的长征么？没有，从来没有的。长征又是宣言书，它向全世界宣告，红军是英雄好汉，帝国主义者和他们的走狗蒋介石等辈则是完全无用的。长征宣告了帝国主义和蒋介石围追堵截的破产。长征又是宣传队。它向十一个省内大约两万万人民宣布，只有红军的道路，才是解放他们的道路。不因此一举，那么广大的民众怎会如此迅速地知道世界上还有红军这样一篇大道理呢？长征又是播种机。它散布了许多种子在十一个省内，发芽、长叶、开花、结果，将来是会有收获的。总而言之，长征是以我们胜利、敌人失败的结果而告结束。谁使长征胜利的呢？是共产党。没有共产党，这样的长征是不可能设想的。中国共产党，它的领导机关，它的干部，它的党员，是不怕任何艰难困苦的。谁怀疑我们领导革命战争的能力，谁就会陷进机会主义的泥坑里去。长征一完结，新局面就开始。直罗镇一仗，中央红军同西北红军兄弟般的团结，粉碎了卖国贼蒋介石向着陕甘边区的“围剿”〔二三〕，给党中央把全国革命大本营放在西北的任务，举行了一个奠基礼。
    主力红军如此，南方各省的游击战争怎么样呢？南方的游击战争，受到了某些挫折，但是并没有被消灭。许多部分，正在恢复、生长和发展〔二四〕。
    在国民党统治区，工人的斗争正在从厂内向着厂外，从经济斗争向着政治斗争。工人阶级的反日反卖国贼的英勇斗争，现在是在深刻地酝酿着，看样子离爆发的时候已不远了。
    农民的斗争没有停止过。在外祸、内难、再加天灾的压迫之下，农民广泛地发动了游击战争、民变、闹荒等等形态的斗争。东北和冀东的抗日游击战争〔二五〕，正在回答日本帝国主义的进攻。
    学生运动已有极大的发展，将来一定还要有更大的发展。但学生运动要得到持久性，要冲破卖国贼的戒严令，警察、侦探、学棍、法西斯蒂的破坏和屠杀，只有和工人、农民、兵士的斗争配合起来，才有可能。
    民族资产阶级、乡村富农和小地主们的动摇以至参加抗日斗争的可能性，前面已经说过了。
    少数民族，特别是内蒙民族，在日本帝国主义的直接威胁之下，正在起来斗争。其前途，将和华北人民的斗争和红军在西北的活动，汇合在一起。
    所有这些都指明，革命的阵势，是由局部性转变到全国性，由不平衡状态逐渐地转变到某种平衡状态。目前是大变动的前夜。党的任务就是把红军的活动和全国的工人、农民、学生、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级的一切活动汇合起来，成为一个统一的民族革命战线。
            民族统一战线
    观察了反革命和革命两方面的形势以后，我们就容易说明党的策略任务了。
    党的基本的策略任务是什么呢？不是别的，就是建立广泛的民族革命统一战线。
    当着革命的形势已经改变的时候，革命的策略，革命的领导方式，也必须跟着改变。日本帝国主义和汉奸卖国贼的任务，是变中国为殖民地。我们的任务，是变中国为独立、自由和领土完整的国家。
    实现中国的独立自由是一个伟大的任务。这须同外国帝国主义和本国反革命势力作战。日本帝国主义是下了凶横直进的决心的。国内豪绅买办阶级的反革命势力，在目前还是大过人民的革命势力。打倒日本帝国主义和中国反革命势力的事业，不是一天两天可以成功的，必须准备花费长久的时间；不是少少一点力量可以成功的，必须聚积雄厚的力量。中国的和世界的反革命力量是比较过去更加衰弱了，中国的和世界的革命力量是比较过去更加增长了。这是正确的估计，这是一方面的估计。但是同时我们应当说，目前中国的和世界的反革命力量暂时还是大于革命力量。这也是正确的估计，这是又一方面的估计。由于中国政治经济发展的不平衡，产生了革命发展的不平衡。革命的胜利总是从那些反革命势力比较薄弱的地方首先开始，首先发展，首先胜利；而在那些反革命势力雄厚的地方，革命还是没有起来，或者发展得很慢。这是中国革命在过去长时期内已经遇到的情形。在将来，可以想到，在某些阶段里，革命的总的形势是更加发展了，但是不平衡状态还会存在着。要把不平衡的状态变到大体上平衡的状态，还要经过很长的时间，还要花费很大的气力，还要依靠党的策略路线的正确。如果说，苏联共产党领导的革命战争〔二六〕是在三个年头里完结了的话，那么中国共产党领导的革命战争，过去已经花去了很长的时间，而要最后地彻底地解决内外反革命势力，我们还得准备再花一个应有的时间，像过去那样地过分的性急是不行的。还得提出一个很好的革命策略，像过去那样地老在狭小的圈子里打转，是干不出大事情来的。不是说中国的事情只能慢吞吞地去干，中国的事情要勇猛地去干，亡国的危险不容许我们有一分钟的懈怠。今后革命发展的速度，也一定比过去要快得多，因为中国的和世界的局面都是临在战争和革命的新时期了。虽然如此，中国革命战争还是持久战，帝国主义的力量和革命发展的不平衡，规定了这个持久性。我们说，时局的特点，是新的民族革命高潮的到来，中国处在新的全国大革命的前夜，这是现时革命形势的特点。这是事实，这是一方面的事实。现在我们又说，帝国主义还是一个严重的力量，革命力量的不平衡状态是一个严重的缺点，要打倒敌人必须准备作持久战，这是现时革命形势的又一个特点。这也是事实，这是又一方面的事实。这两种特点，这两种事实，都一齐跑来教训我们，要求我们适应情况，改变策略，改变我们调动队伍进行战斗的方式。目前的时局，要求我们勇敢地抛弃关门主义，采取广泛的统一战线，防止冒险主义。不到决战的时机，没有决战的力量，不能冒冒失失地去进行决战。
    这里不来说关门主义和冒险主义的关系，也不来说冒险主义在将来大的时局开展中可能发生的危险性，这点等到将来再说不迟。这里只说统一战线的策略和关门主义的策略，是正相反对的两个不同的策略。
    一个要招收广大的人马，好把敌人包围而消灭之。
    一个则依靠单兵独马，去同强大的敌人打硬仗。
    一个说，如果不足够地估计到日本帝国主义变中国为殖民地的行动能够变动中国革命和反革命的阵线，就不能足够地估计到组织广泛的民族革命统一战线的可能性。如果不足够地估计到日本反革命势力、中国反革命势力和中国革命势力这几方面的强点和弱点，就不会足够地估计到组织广泛的民族革命统一战线的必要性；就不会采取坚决的办法去打破关门主义；就不会拿着统一战线这个武器去组织和团聚千千万万民众和一切可能的革命友军，向着日本帝国主义及其走狗中国卖国贼这个最中心的目标而攻击前进；就不会拿自己的策略武器去射击当前的最中心目标，而把目标分散，以至主要的敌人没有打中，次要的敌人甚至同盟军身上却吃了我们的子弹。这个叫做不会择敌和浪费弹药。这样，就不能把敌人驱逐到狭小的孤立的阵地上去。这样，就不能把敌人营垒中被裹胁的人们，过去是敌人而今日可能做友军的人们，都从敌人营垒中和敌人战线上拉过来。这样，就是在实际上帮助了敌人，而使革命停滞、孤立、缩小、降落，甚至走到失败的道路上去。
    一个则说，这些批评都是不对的。革命的力量是要纯粹又纯粹，革命的道路是要笔直又笔直。圣经上载了的才是对的。民族资产阶级是全部永世反革命了。对于富农，是一步也退让不得。对于黄色工会，只有同它拚命。如果同蔡廷锴握手的话，那必须在握手的瞬间骂他一句反革命。那有猫儿不吃油，那有军阀不是反革命？知识分子只有三天的革命性，招收他们是危险的。因此，结论：关门主义是唯一的法宝，统一战线是机会主义的策略。
    同志们，统一战线的道理和关门主义的道理究竟那一个是对的呢？马克思列宁主义到底赞成那一个呢？我坚决地回答：赞成统一战线，反对关门主义。人中间有三岁小孩子，三岁小孩子有许多道理都是对的，但是不能使他们管天下国家的大事，因为他们还不明白天下国家的道理。马克思列宁主义反对革命队伍中的幼稚病。坚持关门主义策略的人们所主张的，就是一套幼稚病。革命的道路，同世界上一切事物活动的道路一样，总是曲折的，不是笔直的。革命和反革命的阵线可能变动，也同世界上一切事物的可能变动一样。日本帝国主义决定要变全中国为它的殖民地，和中国革命的现时力量还有严重的弱点，这两个基本事实就是党的新策略即广泛的统一战线的出发点。组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。只有这样的力量，才能把日本帝国主义和汉奸卖国贼打垮，这是有目共见的真理。因此，只有统一战线的策略才是马克思列宁主义的策略。关门主义的策略则是孤家寡人的策略。关门主义“为渊驱鱼，为丛驱雀”，把“千千万万”和“浩浩荡荡”都赶到敌人那一边去，只博得敌人的喝采。关门主义在实际上是日本帝国主义和汉奸卖国贼的忠顺的奴仆。关门主义的所谓“纯粹”和“笔直”，是马克思列宁主义向之掌嘴，而日本帝国主义则向之嘉奖的东西。我们一定不要关门主义，我们要的是制日本帝国主义和汉奸卖国贼的死命的民族革命统一战线。
            人民共和国〔二七〕
    如果说，我们过去的政府是工人、农民和城市小资产阶级联盟的政府，那么，从现在起，应当改变为除了工人、农民和城市小资产阶级以外，还要加上一切其他阶级中愿意参加民族革命的分子。
    在目前，这个政府的基本任务是反对日本帝国主义吞并中国。这个政府的成份将扩大到广泛的范围，不但那些只对民族革命有兴趣而对土地革命没有兴趣的人，可以参加，就是那些同欧美帝国主义有关系，不能反对欧美帝国主义，却可以反对日本帝国主义及其走狗的人们，只要他们愿意，也可以参加。因此，这个政府的纲领，应当是以适合于反对日本帝国主义及其走狗这个基本任务为原则，据此以适当地修改我们过去的政策。
    现时革命方面的特点，是有了经过锻炼的共产党，又有了经过锻炼的红军。这是一件极关重要的事。如果现时还没有经过锻炼的共产党和红军，那就将发生极大的困难。为什么？因为中国的汉奸卖国贼是很多的，并且是有力量的，他们必然想出各种法子来破坏这个统一战线，用他们威迫利诱、纵横捭阖的手段来挑拨离间，用兵力来强压，来各个击破那些比较他们小的、愿意离开卖国贼、而同我们联合起来打日本的力量。如果抗日政府抗日军队中缺乏共产党和红军这个要素，这种情形是难于避免的。一九二七年革命的失败，主要的原因就是由于共产党内的机会主义路线，不努力扩大自己的队伍（工农运动和共产党领导的军队），而只依仗其暂时的同盟者国民党。其结果是帝国主义命令它的走狗豪绅买办阶级，伸出千百只手来，首先把蒋介石拉去，然后又把汪精卫拉去，使革命陷于失败。那时的革命统一战线没有中心支柱，没有坚强的革命的武装队伍，四面八方都造起反来，共产党只得孤军作战，无力抵制帝国主义和中国反革命的各个击破的策略。那时虽然有贺龙、叶挺一支军队，但还不是政治上坚强的军队，党又不善于领导它，终归失败了。这是缺乏革命中心力量招致革命失败的血的教训。在今天，这件事起了变化了，坚强的共产党和坚强的红军都已经有了，而且有了红军的根据地。共产党和红军不但在现在充当着抗日民族统一战线的发起人，而且在将来的抗日政府和抗日军队中必然要成为坚强的台柱子，使日本帝国主义者和蒋介石对于抗日民族统一战线所使用的拆台政策，不能达到最后的目的。没有疑义，威迫利诱，纵横捭阖的手段，日本帝国主义者和蒋介石是一定要多方使用的，我们是要十分留神的。
    当然，对于抗日民族统一战线的广泛的队伍，我们不能希望每部分都有如同共产党和红军一样程度的巩固。在他们的活动过程中，有些坏分子因为受了敌人的影响退出统一战线的事情，是会发生的。但是我们不怕这些人退出去。一些坏人受敌人的影响退出去，一些好人却会受我们的影响加进来。只要共产党和红军本身是存在的，发展的，那么，抗日民族统一战线必然也会是存在的，发展的。这就是共产党和红军在民族统一战线中的领导作用。共产党人现在已经不是小孩子了，他们能够善处自己，又能够善处同盟者。日本帝国主义者和蒋介石能够用纵横捭阖的手段来对付革命队伍，共产党也能够用纵横捭阖的手段对付反革命队伍。他们能够拉了我们队伍中的坏分子跑出去，我们当然也能够拉了他们队伍中的“坏分子”（对于我们是好分子）跑过来。假如我们能够从他们队伍中多拉一些人出来，那敌人的队伍就减少了，我们的队伍就扩大了。总之，现在是两个基本势力相斗争，一切中间势力，不附属于那一方面，就附属于这一方面，这是一定的道理。而日本帝国主义者和蒋介石灭亡中国和出卖中国的政策，不能不驱使很多的力量跑到我们方面来，或者径直加入共产党和红军的队伍，或者同共产党和红军结成联合战线。只要我们的策略不是关门主义，这个目的是能够达到的。
    为什么要把工农共和国改变为人民共和国呢？
    我们的政府不但是代表工农的，而且是代表民族的。这个意义，是在工农民主共和国的口号里原来就包括了的，因为工人、农民占了全民族人口的百分之八十至九十。我们党的第六次全国代表大会所规定的十大政纲〔二八〕，不但代表了工农的利益，同时也代表了民族的利益。但是现在的情况，使得我们要把这个口号改变一下，改变为人民共和国。这是因为日本侵略的情况变动了中国的阶级关系，不但小资产阶级，而且民族资产阶级，有了参加抗日斗争的可能性。
    那是没有问题的，人民共和国不代表敌对阶级的利益。相反，人民共和国同帝国主义的走狗豪绅买办阶级是处在正相反对的地位，它不把那些成份放在所谓人民之列。这和蒋介石的“中华民国国民政府”，仅仅代表最大的富翁，并不代表老百姓，并不把老百姓放在所谓“国民”之列，是一样的。中国百分之八十至九十的人口是工人和农民，所以人民共和国应当首先代表工人和农民的利益。但是人民共和国去掉帝国主义的压迫，使中国自由独立，去掉地主的压迫，使中国离开半封建制度，这些事情就不但使工农得了利益，也使其他人民得了利益。总括工农及其他人民的全部利益，就构成了中华民族的利益。买办阶级和地主阶级虽然也住在中国的土地上，可是他们是不顾民族利益的，他们的利益是同多数人的利益相冲突的。我们仅仅离开他们这些少数人，仅仅同他们这些少数人相冲突，所以我们有权利称我们自己是代表全民族。
    工人阶级的利益同民族资产阶级的利益也是有冲突的。要开展民族革命，对于民族革命的先锋队不给以政治上、经济上的权利，不使工人阶级能够拿出力量来对付帝国主义及其走狗卖国贼，是不能成功的。但是民族资产阶级如果参加反对帝国主义的统一战线，那末，工人阶级和民族资产阶级就有了共同的利害关系。人民共和国在资产阶级民主革命的时代并不废除非帝国主义的、非封建主义的私有财产，并不没收民族资产阶级的工商业，而且还鼓励这些工商业的发展。任何民族资本家，只要他不赞助帝国主义和中国卖国贼，我们就要保护他。在民主革命阶段，劳资间的斗争是有限度的。人民共和国的劳动法保护工人的利益，却并不反对民族资本家发财，并不反对民族工商业的发展，因为这种发展不利于帝国主义，而有利于中国人民。由此可知：人民共和国是代表反帝国主义反封建势力的各阶层人民的利益的。人民共和国的政府以工农为主体，同时容纳其他反帝国主义反封建势力的阶级。
    让这些人参加人民共和国的政府，不危险吗？不危险的。工人农民是这个共和国的基本群众。给城市小资产阶级、知识分子及其他拥护反帝反封建纲领的分子以在人民共和国政府中说话做事的权利，给他们以选举权和被选举权，不能违背工农基本群众的利益。我们纲领的重要部分应当保护工农基本群众的利益。工农基本群众的代表在人民共和国政府中占了大多数，共产党在这个政府中的领导和活动，都保证了他们进来不危险。中国革命的现时阶段依然是资产阶级民主主义性质的革命，不是无产阶级社会主义性质的革命，这是十分明显的。只有反革命的托洛茨基主义〔二九〕，才瞎说中国已经完成了资产阶级民主革命，再要革命就只是社会主义的革命了。一九二四年至一九二七年的革命是资产阶级民主主义性质的革命，这次革命没有完成，而是失败了。一九二七年至现在，我们领导的土地革命，也是资产阶级民主主义性质的革命，因为革命的任务是反帝反封建，并不是反资本主义。今后一个相当长时期中的革命还是如此。
    革命的动力，基本上依然是工人、农民和城市小资产阶级，现在则可能增加一个民族资产阶级。
    革命的转变，那是将来的事。在将来，民主主义的革命必然要转变为社会主义的革命。何时转变，应以是否具备了转变的条件为标准，时间会要相当地长。不到具备了政治上经济上一切应有的条件之时，不到转变对于全国最大多数人民有利而不是不利之时，不应当轻易谈转变。怀疑这一点而希望在很短的时间内去转变，如像过去某些同志所谓民主革命在重要省份开始胜利之日，就是革命开始转变之时，是不对的。这是因为他们看不见中国是一个何等样的政治经济情况的国家，他们不知道中国在政治上经济上完成民主革命，较之俄国要困难得多，需要更多的时间和努力。
            国际援助
    最后，需要讲一点中国革命和世界革命的相互关系。
    自从帝国主义这个怪物出世之后，世界的事情就连成一气了，要想割开也不可能了。我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力。但是这不是说我们可以不需要国际援助；不，国际援助对于现代一切国家一切民族的革命斗争都是必要的。古人说：“春秋无义战。”〔三○〕于今帝国主义则更加无义战，只有被压迫民族和被压迫阶级有义战。全世界一切由人民起来反对压迫者的战争，都是义战。俄国的二月革命和十月革命是义战。第一次世界大战后欧洲各国人民的革命是义战。中国的反鸦片战争〔三一〕，太平天国战争〔三二〕，义和团战争〔三三〕，辛亥革命战争〔三四〕，一九二六年至一九二七年的北伐战争，一九二七年至现在的土地革命战争，今天的抗日和讨伐卖国贼的战争，都是义战。在目前的全中国抗日高潮和全世界反法西斯高潮中，义战将遍于全中国，全世界。凡义战都是互相援助的，凡非义战都是应该使之转变成为义战的，这就是列宁主义的路线〔三五〕。我们的抗日战争需要国际人民的援助，首先是苏联人民的援助，他们也一定会援助我们，因为我们和他们是休戚相关的。过去一个时期内，中国革命力量和国际革命力量被蒋介石隔断了，就这点上说，我们是孤立的。现在这种形势已经改变了，变得对我们有利了。今后这种形势还会继续向有利的方面改变。我们不会是孤立的了。这是中国抗日战争和中国革命取得胜利的一个必要的条件。

    〔一〕袁世凯为清朝末年北洋军阀的头子。一九一一年的革命推翻清朝以后，他依靠反革命的武力和帝国主义的支持，又利用当时领导革命的资产阶级的妥协性，篡夺了总统的职位，组织了代表大地主大买办阶级的第一个北洋军阀政府。一九一五年他要做皇帝，因为想取得日本帝国主义的支持，就承认了日本的旨在独占中国的二十一条要求。同年十二月，在云南发生了反对袁世凯称帝的起义，随即在各地得到响应。袁世凯于一九一六年六月死于北京。
    〔二〕一九一五年一月十八日，日本帝国主义向中国袁世凯政府提出二十一条要求，五月七日，提出最后通牒，限四十八小时答复。该要求全文共五号：前四号包括德国在山东所掠夺的权利的移让，并要求增加日本在山东的新权利，日本在南满洲和东蒙的土地租借权或所有权，居住权，工商经营权，建筑铁路和开采矿山的独占权，汉冶萍公司改为中日合办，沿海港湾岛屿概不让与第三国等条款；第五号所列款项则要求攫取统治中国的政治、财政、警察、军事的大权，并欲攫取湖北、江西和广东之间的重要铁路建筑权。袁世凯除对第五号声明“容日后协商”外，都加以承认。但因中国人民一致反对，日本的要求未能实行。
    〔三〕一九二一年十一月，美国政府召集中、英、法、意、比、荷、葡、日八国代表，加上美国共九国，在华盛顿开会。这是一个美国与日本争夺远东霸权的会议。次年二月六日，根据美国所谓“各国在华机会均等”和“中国门户开放”的意见，缔结了九国公约。九国公约的作用，是造成帝国主义列强共同控制中国，并在实际上为美帝国主义独占中国作准备的局面，来打消日本独占中国的计划。
    〔四〕一九三一年九月十八日，日本驻在中国东北境内的所谓“关东军”袭取沈阳。这时中国驻沈阳及东北各地的军队（东北军）接受蒋介石的“绝对不抵抗”的命令，撤退至山海关以南，使日军迅速地占领了辽宁、吉林、黑龙江等省。中国人民习惯上称日寇这次侵略的行动为“九一八事变”。
    〔五〕东北四省指当时中国东北部的辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、热河四省，相当于现在的东北大行政区所属辽东、辽西、吉林、松江、黑龙江、热河六省和内蒙自治区大部。九一八事变后，日本侵略军先占领了辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省，一九三三年又侵占热河。
    〔六〕一九三五年十一月二十五日，日本嗾使国民党汉奸殷汝耕在河北省东部二十二个县，成立傀儡政权，名为“冀东防共自治政府”。是为冀东事变。
    〔七〕外交谈判，指当时蒋介石政府与日本政府所进行的关于所谓“广田三原则”的谈判。“广田三原则”是当时日本外相广田弘毅所提出的所谓“对华三原则”，其内容是：一、中国取缔一切排日运动；二、树立中日“满”经济合作；三、中日共同防共。一九三六年一月二十一日广田在日本议会演说称：“中国政府业已承认帝国所提出之三原则。”
    〔八〕毛泽东同志做这个报告的时候，蒋介石继续其出卖东北的伎俩，正又在出卖华北，并继续积极向红军作战。因此，中国共产党必须尽量揭穿蒋介石这个卖国贼的真面目；也因此，中国共产党在这时提出的抗日民族统一战线还没有包括蒋介石在内。但是毛泽东同志在这个报告内，已经说到了各帝国主义的矛盾可能引起中国地主买办阶级营垒中的分化。后来，由于日本帝国主义在华北的进攻，与英美帝国主义的利益发生了严重的冲突，中国共产党就认为和英美帝国主义利益密切联系的蒋介石集团可能在其主子的命令下改变对日本的态度，因而采取逼迫蒋介石转向抗日的政策。一九三六年五月，红军由山西回师陕北，即直接向南京国民党政府要求停止内战一致抗日。同年八月，中国共产党中央又致国民党中央一封信，要求组织两党共同反日的统一战线，并派遣代表进行谈判。但蒋介石仍然拒绝共产党的主张。直到一九三六年十二月蒋介石被国民党内主张联共抗日的军人所扣留的时候，他才被迫接受共产党关于停止内战准备抗日的要求。
    〔九〕蔡廷锴是国民党第十九路军的一个军长，兼该路军的副总指挥，与陈铭枢蒋光鼐同为该路军的负责人。该路军原来在江西与红军作战，九一八事变后调往上海。那时上海和全国人民抗日的高潮，给了十九路军以很大影响。一九三二年一月二十八日夜，日本海军陆战队向上海攻击，十九路军和上海人民在一起进行了抗战。但是这个战争后来因为蒋介石和汪精卫的出卖而失败。随后，十九路军又被蒋介石调到福建去和红军作战。这时十九路军的领导人物逐渐觉悟到和红军作战乃是没有出路的行为。一九三三年十一月，十九路军将领联合国民党内李济深等的一部分势力，公开宣布与蒋介石破裂。他们在福建省成立“中华共和国人民革命政府”，并与红军成立抗日反蒋的协定。十九路军和福建人民政府在蒋介石的兵力压迫下失败。以后蔡廷锴等人逐步地转入了与共产党合作的立场。
    〔一○〕一九二六年九月，当北伐的革命军攻抵武汉时，冯玉祥率领他的军队在绥远省宣布脱离北洋军阀的系统而参加革命。一九二七年初，其部队由陕西出发，和北伐军会同进攻河南省。一九二七年蒋介石和汪精卫叛变后，冯玉祥亦参与反对共产党的活动，但和蒋介石集团间始终存在着利害冲突。九一八事变后，他赞成抗日，在一九三三年五月间，与共产党合作，在张家口组织民众抗日同盟军。由于蒋介石势力和日本侵略军的双重压迫，这次抗日起义于八月间失败。冯玉祥在晚年继续采取与共产党合作的立场。
    〔一一〕国民党第二十六路军被蒋介石派到江西进攻红军。一九三一年十二月，该路军一万余人在赵博生、董振堂等同志领导下，响应中共抗日号召，于江西宁都起义加入红军。
    〔一二〕马占山原为东北军的军官，他的部队驻在黑龙江。当日本侵略军在九一八事变后由辽宁向黑龙江推进时，该部曾进行抵抗。
    〔一三〕胡汉民为国民党的著名政客，曾反对孙中山与中国共产党合作的政策，是一九二七年蒋介石发动“四一二”反革命政变的同谋者。后因与蒋争夺权利，被蒋监禁。九一八事变后被释放，由南京到广州，策动两广派军阀势力与蒋介石南京政府形成长期对立的局面。
    〔一四〕“抗日救国六大纲领”即“中国人民对日作战基本纲领”，由中国共产党在一九三四年提出，经宋庆龄等签名公布。纲领包括下列各项条款：（一）全体海陆空军总动员对日作战；（二）全体人民总动员；（三）全体人民总武装；（四）没收日本帝国主义在华财产及卖国贼财产以解决抗日战费；（五）成立工农兵学商代表选举出来的全中国民族武装自卫委员会；（六）联合日本帝国主义的一切敌人作友军，与一切守善意中立的国家建立友谊关系。
    〔一五〕两广派军阀指广东的陈济棠、广西的李宗仁、白崇禧等。
    〔一六〕蒋介石匪帮把革命人民叫做“匪”，把他们自己用军队进攻和屠杀革命人民的行为叫做“剿匪”。
    〔一七〕任弼时同志，中国共产党最早的党员和组织家之一。自一九二七年中国共产党第五次全国代表大会后，在党的历次大会上均被选为中央委员，在一九三一年党的六届四中全会上，被选为中央政治局委员。一九三三年时，任弼时同志任湘赣边区省委书记兼红军第六军团政治委员。红六军团与红二军团会合后，任弼时同志担任二、六两军团组成的第二方面军的政治委员。抗日战争初期任八路军总政治部主任。一九四○年参加中共中央书记处工作。一九四五年党的七届一中全会上当选为中央政治局委员和中央书记处书记。一九五○年十月二十七日逝世于北京。
    〔一八〕中国工农红军第六军团原驻湘赣边区根据地，一九三四年七月奉中共中央的命令开始突围转移。同年十月，在贵州东部与贺龙同志率领的红军第二军团会合，组成红军第二方面军，开辟湘鄂川黔的革命根据地。
    〔一九〕一九三四年十月，中国工农红军第一、第三、第五军团（即红军第一方面军），从福建西部的长汀、宁远和江西南部的瑞金雩都等地出发，开始战略性的大转移。红军经过福建、江西、广东、湖南、广西、贵州、四川、云南、西康、甘肃、陕西等十一个省，走过终年积雪的高山，越过人迹罕至的草地，历尽艰苦，击溃敌人多次的围追堵截，连续行军两万五千华里（一万二千五百公里），终于在一九三五年十月，胜利地到达陕西北部的革命根据地。
    〔二○〕川陕边区的红军，即中国工农红军第四方面军。一九三五年三月，第四方面军离开川陕边区根据地，向四川西康两省的边境转移。同年六月，在四川西部的懋功地方与红军第一方面军会合，组织左右两路军北上，于同年九月到达松潘附近毛儿盖一带地区。这时候，在四方面军工作的张国焘违抗中共中央的命令，擅自率领左路军南下，分裂红军。直到一九三六年六月，红军第二方面军由湘鄂川黔边区突围，经湖南、贵州、云南到达西康的甘孜，与四方面军会合。四方面军的同志们违反了张国焘的意志，与第二方面军一起作了北上的转移。同年十一月，第二方面军全体和第四方面军的一部分到达陕北，与红军第一方面军胜利会师。
    〔二一〕张国焘，中国革命的叛徒。早年投机革命，参加中国共产党。他在党内错误极多，造成了极大的罪恶。其最著者为一九三五年反对红军北上，主张红军向四川西藏间少数民族区域退却的失败主义和取消主义，并且进行公开的反党反中央的背叛活动，自立伪中央，破坏党和红军的统一，使红军第四方面军蒙受了重大的损失。红军第四方面军及其广大干部由于毛泽东同志和党中央的耐心教育，迅速地回到了党中央的正确领导之下，并在后来的斗争中起了光荣的作用；但张国焘本人则终于不可救药，于一九三八年春季，只身逃出陕甘宁边区，并投入了国民党特务集团。
    〔二二〕中央红军，指原来在江西福建区域发展起来而由中共中央所直接领导的红军，即红军第一方面军。
    〔二三〕一九三五年七月，国民党军开始对陕甘革命根据地的第三次“围剿”。陕北红军第二十六军先在东线击溃了敌人两个旅，将该线敌人赶到黄河东面。同年九月，原在鄂豫皖根据地的红军第二十五军，经陕南陇东到达陕北，与陕北红军会合，成立红军第十五军团。红十五军团在甘泉劳山战役中消灭敌军一一○师大部，击毙其师长，不久又将敌军一○七师的四个营消灭于甘泉榆林桥。于是敌人重新组织进攻，以董英斌（东北军的一个军长）带五个师分两路进攻，东边一个师沿洛川鄜县大道北上，西边四个师由甘肃的庆阳合水沿葫芦河向陕北鄜县方面前进。同年十月，中央红军到达陕北。十一月，中央红军和红十五军团共同歼灭敌军一○九师于鄜县西南的直罗镇，又于追击中歼灭敌军一○六师一个团于黑水寺。这样就彻底粉碎了敌人对陕甘根据地的第三次“围剿”。
    〔二四〕一九三四至一九三五年间，中国南部红军的主力转移时，曾经留下了一部分游击部队。这些游击部队在八个省份内，坚持了十四个地区的游击战争。这些地区是：浙南地区，闽北地区，闽东地区，赣东北地区，闽南地区，闽西地区，闽赣边地区，粤赣边地区，湘南地区，湘赣边地区，湘鄂赣边地区，鄂豫皖边地区，豫南桐柏山区和广东省的琼崖地区。
    〔二五〕一九三一年日本帝国主义侵占东北以后，中国共产党号召人民武装反抗，组织了抗日游击队和东北人民革命军，援助了各种形式的抗日义勇军。一九三四年后，一切东北抗日的队伍，在中国共产党领导下，组成为统一的东北抗日联军，以著名的共产党员杨靖宇为总指挥，长期坚持了东北的抗日游击战争。冀东的抗日游击战争，系指一九三五年五月发生于河北省东部的一次农民抗日起义。
    〔二六〕苏联共产党领导的革命战争，系指一九一八年至一九二○年苏联人民反对英美法日波等帝国主义的武装干涉和平定白党叛乱的战争。
    〔二七〕毛泽东同志在这里所提出的人民共和国的政权性质及其各项政策，在抗日战争期间，已经在共产党领导下的人民解放区完全实现了。因此，共产党能够在敌后战场领导人民对于日寇进行胜利的战争。在日本投降以后爆发的第三次国内革命战争中，随着战争的进展，人民解放区逐步扩张到了全中国，这样就出现了统一的中华人民共和国。毛泽东同志关于人民共和国的理想，就在全国范围内实现了。
    〔二八〕在一九二八年七月间举行的中国共产党第六次全国代表大会，规定了下列的十大政纲：一、推翻帝国主义的统治；二、没收外国资本的企业和银行；三、统一中国，承认民族自决权；四、推翻军阀国民党的政府；五、建立工农兵代表会议政府；六、实行八小时工作制，增加工资、失业救济与社会保险等；七、没收一切地主阶级的土地，耕地归农；八、改善兵士生活，发给兵士土地和工作；九、取消一切政府军阀地方的捐税，实行统一的累进税；十、联合世界无产阶级和苏联。
    〔二九〕托洛茨基集团，原是俄国工人运动中的一个反对列宁主义的派别，后来堕落成为完全反革命的匪帮。关于这个叛徒集团的演变，斯大林同志于一九三七年在联共中央全会上的报告里，作过如下的说明：“过去，在七八年以前，托洛茨基主义曾是工人阶级中的……政派之一，固然，是一个反列宁主义、因此也就是极端错误的政派，可是，它当时总算是一个政派。……现时的托洛茨基主义，并不是工人阶级中的政派，而是一伙无原则的、无思想的、暗害者、军事破坏者、侦探间谍、杀人凶手的匪帮，是外国侦探机关雇佣的奸细。”在一九二七年中国革命遭受失败之后，中国也出现了少数的托洛茨基分子，他们与陈独秀等叛徒相结合，于一九二九年形成了一个反革命的小组织，散布国民党已经完成了资产阶级民主革命等类的反革命宣传，完全是帝国主义和国民党的反对人民的卑污工具。中国的托洛茨基分子公开参加国民党的特务机关。在九一八事变后，他们接受托洛茨基匪贼的“不阻碍日本帝国占领中国”的指令，与日本特务机关合作，领取日寇的津贴，从事各种有利于日本侵略者的活动。
    〔三○〕“春秋无义战”，语见“孟子”。春秋时代（公元前七二二——四八一年），中国许多封建诸侯相互不间断地进行争权夺利的战争，所以孟子有此说法。
    〔三一〕一八四○年至一八四二年，英国因中国人反对鸦片贸易，借口保护通商，派兵侵略中国，中国军队在林则徐领导下曾经进行了抵抗的战争。那时，广州人民自发地组织了“平英团”，也使英国侵略者受了很大的打击。
    〔三二〕太平天国战争是发生于十九世纪中叶的反对满清封建统治和民族压迫的农民革命战争。一八五一年一月，这次革命的领导者洪秀全、杨秀清等，在广西桂平县的金田村起义，宣布成立“太平天国”。一八五二年出广西，经湖南、湖北、江西、安徽，于一八五三年攻克南京。随后从南京分出一部兵力北上，一直打到天津附近。但太平军在它占领的地方都没有建立起巩固的根据地，建都南京后它的领导集团又犯了许多政治上和军事上的错误，因此不能抵抗清朝的反革命军队和英美法侵略分子的联合进攻，而在一八六四年失败。
    〔三三〕义和团战争，是一九○○年中国北部农民和手工业者群众，采取神秘主义的秘密结社的形态，武装反对帝国主义的广大的自发运动。八个帝国主义国家的联合武装力量占领北京天津，极残酷地镇压了这个运动。
