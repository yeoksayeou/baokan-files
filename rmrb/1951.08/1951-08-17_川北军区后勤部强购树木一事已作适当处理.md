A Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

　　The Logistics Department of the North Sichuan Military Region Has Appropriately Handled the Matter of Forced Purchase of Trees
    Editor:
    After the People's Daily published a reader's letter from Comrade Zan Xinmin on May 17th criticizing our department's Barracks Management Section's work in purchasing trees in Wangcang County, we immediately sent people to Wangcang County to investigate and handle the matter. We are now informing you of the results.
    (1) Comrade Gai Genyou, a procurement officer, because of his weak mass perspective, did not adequately contact local authorities when purchasing trees, lacked a mass viewpoint, did not thoroughly study tree prices beforehand, and was not amiable enough in his attitude towards the masses in his eagerness to complete the task. This caused dissatisfaction and misunderstanding among the masses, which is completely factual.
    (2) The procurement personnel often used the method of "buying green mountains" for procurement, that is, buying everything regardless of size or age. Although rural cadres accompanied them to mark the trees, they did not explain it to the forest owners in person, and this approach was also very inappropriate.
    (3) The reason why the payment for trees was deposited in the farmers' association in Zhanghua Township was because they bought trees from landlords, not because the price of the trees was too low for the farmers' association to distribute the funds.
    (4) Li Puyuan, the leader of the farmers' association, was unwilling to sell some trees suitable for construction. Nan Xijiang of the procurement team said to him, "You cadres should take the lead." Nan Xijiang also said to others, "If Leader Li continues to 'haggle' (meaning to be difficult) with us, we will detain him and send him to Nanchong." Later, Nan repeatedly apologized to the masses and Li Puyuan for these words, but he was unable to eliminate the other party's dissatisfaction.
    Based on the above situation, we have taken the following measures:
    (1) The local government has been assisted in convening a mass meeting to accept the criticisms of the masses regarding the procurement work and to apologize to the masses.
    (2) For those with excessively low tree prices, compensation will be made according to local market prices, but the farmers generally refused to accept the compensation. Compensation has been paid at a discounted rate for the seedlings and houses damaged due to felling and transporting trees.
    (3) The tree funds of more than one million yuan deposited in the Zhanghua Township Commune belong to landlords and temples and have been deposited in the bank by the township commune.
    (4) In addition to making self-criticisms, Comrades Gai Genyou and Nan Xijiang have been reported to higher authorities for disciplinary action.

### 川北军区后勤部强购树木一事已作适当处理

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　川北军区后勤部强购树木一事已作适当处理
    编辑同志：
    五月十七日人民日报读者来信栏发表了读者昝新民同志对我部营房管理科在旺苍县采购树木工作的批评后，我们当即派人前往旺苍县调查处理，现在将处理结果告诉你们。
    （一）采购员盖根有同志，因为群众观点不强，在采购树木时与地方机关联系不够，缺乏群众观点，事先未很好研究树木的价格，为了急于完成任务，对待群众的态度不够和霭，因此引起了群众的不满和误会，这完全是事实。
    （二）采购人员常常用“买青山”的方式进行采购，即不分大小老幼一齐买。虽然有农村干部随同号树，但是没有向林主当面说明，这样的作法也很不适当。
    （三）在张华乡购树时，将价款存在农会，那是因为买了地主的树。并不是因为树价太低使农会发不出树款。
    （四）农会组长李蒲元有几棵适合建筑需要的树不愿出卖，采购组南西江对他说：“你们干部应该起带头作用。”南西江并曾向其他人谈：“如果李组长再和我们‘扯筋’（闹蹩扭之意），我们就把他扣起来送到南充去。”后来南为这几句话曾数次向群众及李蒲元作检讨道歉，但一直没有能消除对方的不满。
    根据以上情况，我们已作了如下的处理：
    （一）由当地政府帮助召开群众大会，接受群众对采购工作的批评并向群众道歉。
    （二）树价过低者，照当地市价补给，但农民们一般都拒绝了接受补偿。对于因伐运树木而毁坏的青苗和房屋，已折价赔偿。
    （三）存在张华乡公所的树款一百余万元，系地主，寺庙的树款，已由乡公所存入银行。
    （四）盖根有、南西江两同志除作了自我检讨以外，并已报请上级机关予以处分。
