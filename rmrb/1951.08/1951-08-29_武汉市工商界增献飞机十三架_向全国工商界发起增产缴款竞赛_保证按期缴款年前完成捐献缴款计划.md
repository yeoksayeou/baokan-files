Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 28th: The Wuhan business community has launched a production increase and donation payment competition to the national business community. The city's business community guarantees to pay the donation amount for the previous month before the 10th of each month, and to complete the donation plan by the end of December.

The number of aircraft to be donated by the Wuhan business community has increased from thirty to forty-three, and RMB 9.72 billion has been paid. The city's business community's donation campaign is being carried out under the general guideline of increasing production and improving management. For example, private cloth shops such as Dacheng, Guoda, and Qianxiangyi Hengji, as well as Ruichang Hardware, are carrying out production increase and donation campaigns through further improvement of labor-management relations and improvement of business operations. Dacheng Cloth Store changed the sales ratio of popular goods to high-end goods from three to two to two to one, and Guoda Cloth Store reduced the total purchase amount of silk and woolen fabrics from 15% to 12%, and increased cotton textiles from 65% to 68%. Due to planned operations geared towards the working class and peasants, the turnover has greatly increased, increasing the ability to donate. Qianxiangyi Hengji Cloth Store also organized a rural service team to promote industrial products to the countryside. Therefore, the store completed its original quota of 1.6 billion yuan, which was scheduled to be completed by the end of August, twenty days ahead of schedule on August 10.

In order to ensure the completion of the production increase and donation plan as scheduled, the Wuhan Municipal All-Circles Patriotic Production Increase and Donation Weapons Committee's Federation of Industry and Commerce branch convened a representative conference on August 23rd and 24th to promote the above donation methods and called on all industries to universally formulate production increase and donation plans. The representatives unanimously passed a friendly payment competition to the national business community and sent a salute telegram to Chairman Mao.

　　武汉市工商界增献飞机十三架
    向全国工商界发起增产缴款竞赛
    保证按期缴款年前完成捐献缴款计划
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】武汉市工商界向全国工商界发起增产捐献缴款竞赛。该市工商界保证每月十日以前缴清上月的捐款数额，到十二月底全部完成捐献计划。
    武汉市工商界决定捐献飞机的数目，已由三十架增加到四十三架，现已缴款人民币九十七亿二千余万元。该市工商界的捐献运动是在增加生产、改善经营的总方针下开展起来的。例如私营大成、国大、谦祥益衡记等布店及瑞昌五金号等，都从进一步改善劳资关系和改善营业的努力中开展增产捐献运动。大成布店把大众货物和高贵货物的营业额从三比二改为二比一，国大布店把绸缎呢绒的总购货额的百分之十五降到百分之十二，棉织品从百分之六十五提高到百分之六十八。由于经营有计划地面向工农大众，所以营业额大大提高，增加捐献的能力。谦祥益衡记布店并组织下乡活动服务队，向农村推销工业品。因此该店原计划八月底完成的十六亿定额，已在八月十日提前二十天完成。
    武汉市各界爱国增产捐献武器委员会工商联分会为保证如期完成增产捐献计划，于八月二十三、二十四日召开代表大会，推广上述捐献办法，号召各行业普遍订立增产捐献计划。到会代表一致通过向全国工商界作友谊的缴款竞赛，并电毛主席致敬。
