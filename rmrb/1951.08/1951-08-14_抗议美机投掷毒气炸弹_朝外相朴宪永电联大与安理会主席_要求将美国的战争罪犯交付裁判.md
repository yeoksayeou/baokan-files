Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 13th: During the Korean armistice talks, American aggressor aircraft have not only intensified their indiscriminate bombing of peaceful Korean towns and villages, but recently have committed new crimes by repeatedly dropping poison gas bombs during bombing raids. In response, Korean Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong sent a cable to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the President of the Security Council on the 11th, protesting this new atrocity by the American aggressors. The cable begins:

　　“American interventionists are intensifying their bestial bombing and naval artillery shelling during the armistice negotiations, but they have not achieved their expected goals. Recently, in order to threaten the Korean people and weaken their heroic resistance, they have actually used poison gas in the war.

　　“At 16:30 on August 1st, American planes dropped two 300-kilogram bombs filled with poison gas on Yenan City. As a result, three soldiers and forty residents were immediately poisoned, nine of whom are in serious condition. Symptoms of poisoning include fever, tearing, coughing, and vomiting.

　　“At 6:30 on August 7th, American planes dropped bombs filled with poison gas over the Dounanshan (transliteration) and Suidao (transliteration) highlands occupied by the Korean People's Army. Eight of the twenty-two poisoned soldiers died.

　　“The Americans have also used bombs filled with poison gas against the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on other battlefields."

　　The cable points out: "The use of poison gas by American commanders in the war of aggression against Korea is a new crime in violation of international law. The systematic creation of new atrocities by the American aggressors during the armistice negotiations exposes the attitude of the American aggressors towards the restoration of peace in Korea."

　　The cable states: "As is well known, the American aggressors are using the name of the United Nations to cover up their crimes of aggression against Korea. All eighteen countries that have sent troops to Korea at the request of the United States are accomplices in this crime. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea opposes the continuous atrocities committed by the interventionists, especially the use of poison gas, and therefore has decided to lodge a protest, and at the same time demands that the United Nations and other member states participating in the intervention in Korea resolutely sever their relations with crimes against human conscience and security, and withdraw their own troops from Korea; and demands that the American war criminals be brought to justice."

　　抗议美机投掷毒气炸弹
    朝外相朴宪永电联大与安理会主席
    要求将美国的战争罪犯交付裁判
    【新华社平壤十三日电】在朝鲜停战谈判期间，美国侵略军的飞机不仅加紧对朝鲜和平城乡滥肆轰炸，最近竟又制造新的罪行，在轰炸时一再投掷毒气炸弹。朝鲜外务相朴宪永为此特于十一日致电联合国大会主席与安理会主席，抗议美国侵略者这一新的暴行。电文首称：
    美国干涉者在停战谈判期间变本加厉地进行野兽般的轰炸和舰炮射击，但它并未达到预期的目的。最近，它为了威胁朝鲜人民，削弱朝鲜人民的英雄抗战，竟在战争中使用毒气。
    八月一日十六时三十分，美机在延安市投掷了装有毒气的三百公斤炸弹两颗。结果，军人三名和居民四十名当即中毒，其中九名情况严重。中毒的征候是发烧、流泪、咳嗽和呕吐。
    八月七日六时三十分，美机在朝鲜人民军所占领的斗南山（译音）、水岛（译音）高地上空投掷了装有毒气的炸弹。在二十二名中毒的军人中有八名死亡。
    美国人在其他战场上也对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军使用了装有毒气的炸弹。
    电文指出：美国司令官们在侵略朝鲜的战争中使用毒气，这是违反国际法的新罪行。美国侵略者在停战谈判进行期间有计划地制造新暴行，暴露出美国侵略者对恢复朝鲜和平一事所抱的态度。
    电文称：如所周知，美国侵略者是利用联合国的名义来掩盖它侵略朝鲜的罪行的，凡是依照美国的要求派军队到朝鲜来的十八个国家，都是这种罪行的帮凶。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府反对干涉者所不断制造的暴行，特别是使用毒气的暴行，因此特决定提出抗议，同时要求联合国及其他参加干涉朝鲜的会员国，坚决打断它们与反对人类良心和安全的罪行的关系，从朝鲜撤回它们自己的军队；并要求将美国的战争罪犯交付裁判。
