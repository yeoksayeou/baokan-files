　　Reading "Biography of the Patriotic Poet Du Fu"
       Yang Gang
    Written by Feng Zhi, serialized in "New Observer" magazine, Volume 2, Issues 1 through 12

    China is a country with a great cultural tradition and a rich artistic heritage. However, no matter how many brilliant works there have been in poetry, novels, drama, painting, sculpture, and so on, and no matter how many magnificent figures have stood out in these fields, we have very little understanding of the history of these figures. The cultural history of old China does not leave behind a decent biography of writers and artists to make it easy for us to understand how these great men, under such difficult and arduous objective conditions, radiated the eternal light of the Chinese nation for the motherland and the people. What the feudal rulers sought was not culture, but offerings; not creation, but enjoyment. This is the main reason why the lives of creators were submerged. Secondly, in old China, scientific thought and scientific research methods could not develop, so that Chinese biographical research, like Chinese cultural history, could not be carried out, and often degenerated into a semi-true and semi-false path of collecting stories and compiling impressions. This is also a reason why the study of Chinese writer biographies is not flourishing. As for these so-called biographies, it goes without saying that their standpoint is to praise or criticize based on the likes and dislikes of the feudal ruling class.

    Mr. Feng Zhi's "Biography of the Patriotic Poet Du Fu," published in Volume 2 of "New Observer," although not yet the most detailed and ideal, should be said to be the first good book among the existing Chinese writer biographies. First of all, it stands on the position of the people and uses scientific methods to find clues from the poet's own poems, from the works of Du Fu's contemporaries, and from fragmentary and chaotic records, and produces results through meticulous research. Regarding Du Fu's life experience, from his lonely birth to his desolate death, there is nothing that is not based on evidence. What kind of era events his poems reflect, and what kind of thoughts and feelings he reflects, have all been clarified by Mr. Feng Zhi's meticulous research. People who have not read "Biography of the Patriotic Poet Du Fu" generally do not easily know that Du Fu drifted in his later years, homeless, and could only spend the last year or so of his old age, illness, poverty, and hardship on a boat on the water. They would not know how cruel the feudal ruling class treated our greatest poet. Moreover, due to the contempt and neglect of the poet, some records of the ruling class actually said that his death was due to eating beef and white wine in Leiyang. This slander caused some inappropriate views on Du Fu among later generations. Based on Du Fu's poems, Yuan Zhen's epitaph, and the records of Du Fu's descendants, Feng Zhi finally concluded that Du Fu died of illness on that small boat that had carried him for more than a year in the winter of 770 AD, at the lower reaches of the Xiang River, not in Leiyang. In this way, the controversy about Du Fu's death for more than a thousand years has been resolved.

    Regarding his creation, this biography tells us that "The Ballad of the Army Carts" is Du Fu's first poem to speak for the people. It says: "With the appearance of 'The Ballad of the Army Carts,' the territory of his poems expanded, and inside appeared the people of the Tang Dynasty who were exploited and driven like chickens and dogs." From this, we know that Du Fu, a son of the feudal class from a so-called "family of generations of officials," did not simply sing for the people based on his kindness and talent. Like ordinary wealthy children, he spent half his life traveling around with fine clothes and horses. It was not until he was trapped in Chang'an for ten years, experiencing hunger, cold, and humiliation, that real life educated him, and he opened his eyes and saw the people. The suffering of the people became the source of his poetry. Therefore, the ten years of life in Chang'an was a key to Du Fu's creative life.

    The biography written by Mr. Feng Zhi not only draws scientific conclusions about Du Fu's life, but also, through the study of Du Fu's poems, paints the flesh and blood of the historical era. The social appearance of the time, the suffering of the people; the civil and military figures of the time, such as Fang Guan and Yan Wu; various domestic wars of the time, including warlord wars, and even the dances, music, and paintings of the time, all have vivid, sometimes detailed, narratives, which enable us to see many things that the New and Old Tang Books have overlooked. One of the most painful eras in Chinese history can be vividly unfolded before us like a picture, becoming a record of the people. The author's research methods and writing methods not only open up new paths for biographical writing, but even provide referential methods for Chinese historians to study and judge history from the perspective of the people, and open up the boundaries of their research scope. Even in the study of ancient history, people can also apply Chairman Mao's instruction on the necessity of conducting investigations and research, and widely discover the footprints of history from the materials spoken and done by the characters of the time in poems, novels, stories, notes, paintings, and so on.

    × × ×

    Du Fu left behind one thousand three or four hundred poems, the theme range of which is very wide. It touches on history, society, military politics, country, individuals, characters, art, mountains, rivers, grass, trees, insects, fish, birds, and animals. He is the Chinese poet with the richest theme content. As Mr. Feng pointed out, the characteristic of Du Fu's poems in terms of content is that they are closely centered on the reality of social and political life. In addition to the poems directly depicting the lives of the people, such as "Three Officials," "Three Separations," and "Northern Expedition," which Mr. Feng specially emphasized and recommended, even some of his poems expressing personal feelings and comparing himself with ancient people, such as "Visiting the Temple of the First Ruler" and the poems about Yu Xin in "Remembering Ancient Sites," are all based on the feelings of worrying about the country and the people and lamenting his own uselessness to the times, and are far from a trivial and humble self-intoxication. This enthusiasm for loving the country and the people runs through his life, and many of his poems quoted by Feng Zhi prove this point. Even the "Eight Elegies" and "Various Generals," which Mr. Feng does not particularly approve of, and even the eight "Autumn Thoughts," which are all music from beginning to end and use many symbolic words, are all filled with realistic content. Just reading the sixth of "Autumn Thoughts" is enough to fully understand:

    Qutang Gorge mouth, Qujiang head, Ten thousand miles of wind and smoke connect with the autumn sky.
    Flower Calyx Wall connects with the imperial aura, Hibiscus Garden enters the border worries.
    Pearl curtains and embroidered pillars surround yellow cranes, Brocade cables and ivory masts raise white gulls.
    Looking back, the place of singing and dancing is pitiful, Qinzhong has been the capital of emperors since ancient times.

    There have also been some poets in Chinese history who have written some poems that accuse and satirize their times, but directly satirizing the emperor like this poem by Du Fu, as well as the other poems quoted in this biography, are rare. His consistent realism, starting from loving the country and the people, made him unable to not see that the main people responsible for the disasters of the country and the people were those emperors. Even the so-called loyalty and love for the ruler that he learned from Confucian education could not make him not speak to these rulers.

    Despite the fact that Du Fu's poems are all-encompassing and artistically charming, "Biography of the Patriotic Poet Du Fu" grasps the main spirit and key of Du Fu, and affirms the poet's patriotism and his love for the people. The author's judgment is fully appropriate for the poet, and has great educational significance for us to analyze and understand historical figures. Here is a preliminary attempt on how to accept literary heritage, especially the literary works of intellectuals in old China. With the exception of a few people, the intellectual writers of old China were almost all connected to the feudal ruling class by blood, and their ideological content was roughly within the scope of Confucianism and Taoism, with some mixed Buddhist ideas. They more or less needed to serve the ruling dynasty in order to live. This is one aspect of their belonging to the camp of the exploiting class. But on the other hand, they could not help but come into contact with the pain of the people, and when they came into contact with it, they could not help but develop thoughts and feelings. At the same time, and most importantly, they themselves could not help but be exploited and oppressed by the ruling dynasty. They were both exploiters and exploited. This contradiction is often manifested as the two-sidedness of their poems, one side being the desire to advance and become officials, and the other side being the deep feelings of pain and unreasonableness towards reality, some of which are expressed as accusations, and most of which adopt an attitude of escape. Du Fu also has this two-sidedness. In this book, Feng Zhi rightly points out the two-sidedness contained in Du Fu's poems, but at the same time, based on the main and consistent aspect of the poems concerning the suffering of the people and the disasters of the country, he affirms that he is a great poet who loves the country and the people. This is correct.

        × × ×

    One shortcoming of this book is that it says too little about Du Fu's position and role in the artistic history of Chinese poetry. What exactly is the position of this great poet who loves the country and the people in the tradition of Chinese poetry, and what kind of role does he play? What did he inherit in our poetry tradition, and what did he develop? Due to space limitations or other reasons, the author may have intentionally put it down. However, from the perspective of the need to study and understand Du Fu and study and understand the history of Chinese poetry, we cannot but hope that the author of this book and other authors will make up for this deficiency.

### 读“爱国诗人杜甫传”

　　读“爱国诗人杜甫传”
       杨刚
    冯至著，连载于“新观察”杂志第二卷第一期至第十二期
    中国是一个有伟大文化传统和丰富艺术遗产的国家。但是，不管是在诗歌、小说、戏曲、绘画、雕刻等等方面曾经有过多少光辉灿烂的作品，不管在这些方面曾经站立着一些怎样光芒万丈的人物，我们对于这些人物的历史却很少认识。旧中国的文化史上没有留下一本像样的文学家艺术家的传记让我们容易了解这些伟人是在怎样艰苦困难的客观条件之下，为祖国为人民放射中华民族的永不消褪的光芒。封建统治者所讲求的不是文化，而是供奉；不是创造，而是享受。这是创作家的生活被淹灭的主要原因。其次，在旧中国，科学思想与科学的研究方法不能发展，使中国的传记研究跟中国的文化史一样，不能开展，往往流于捃拾故事，编凑印象的半真半假之途。这也是中国作家传记之学不振的一个原因。至于这些所谓传记，其立言的观点，是以封建统治阶级的好恶为褒贬就更不必说了。
    冯至先生在《新观察》第二卷发表的《爱国诗人杜甫传》，虽然还不能说是最详尽的最理想的，却应该说是已有的中国作家传记中的第一本好书。它首先是站在人民的立场上用科学的方法从诗人自己的诗篇中，从杜甫同时代人的著作之中，从片断的，杂乱的记载之中，寻找线索，缜密研究而产生的结果。关于杜甫一生的经历，从孤苦的出生起，到凄凉的死亡止，没有一事不是有凭有据的。他所有的诗篇反映了何种时代事件，反映了他自己何种思想感情都被冯至先生用精细的研究弄得清清楚楚。没读“爱国诗人杜甫传”的人一般都不容易知道杜甫晚年漂流，无家可归，只能在水上船中度去他最后一年多老病穷困的生活。他们不会知道封建统治阶级对待我们最伟大的诗人是何等的残酷。并且由于对诗人的轻蔑和忽视，统治阶级的有些记载竟把他的死说成是由于在耒阳吃牛肉白酒胀死的。这种诬蔑使后人对杜甫发生了一些不适当的看法。冯至根据杜甫的诗，元稹的墓志以及杜甫子孙的记载，最后断定杜甫是在公历七七○年冬天病死于那条载着他漂流了一年多的小船上，地点是湘江下游而不是耒阳。这样千多年来关于杜甫的死的争论是解决了。
    关于他的创作方面，这本传记告诉我们《兵车行》是杜甫第一首替人民说话的诗。它说：“随着《兵车行》的出现，他的诗的国土扩大了，里边出现了唐代被剥削，被驱使得像鸡犬一样的人民。”从此，我们知道杜甫这个出身于所谓“世代簪缨”之家的封建阶级的子弟并不是单纯凭着他的好心和天才来为人民歌唱的。他像一般富贵子弟一样，裘马遨游过了半生。直到困于长安十年，感受饥寒和屈辱，现实生活教育了他，他才睁开眼睛，看见了人民。人民的苦难才变成了他诗歌的源泉。因此，长安十年的生活对于杜甫的创作生活是一个关键。
    冯至先生所作的这本传记，不但是把杜甫这个人物的一生下了科学的定论，并且经由对杜甫诗歌的研究，绘出了历史时代的血肉。当时社会的面貌，人民的苦难；当时的文武人物如房琯严武等；当时各种规模的国内战争包括军阀战争，甚至当时的舞蹈，音乐，绘画都有生动的，有时是详细的叙述，这使我们能够看到新旧唐书所忽略了的许多东西。中国历史上最痛苦的时代之一就能够生动活泼像一幅图画似地展开在我们面前，成为人民的记录。作者的研究方法与写作方法不但是为传记写作开辟了新路，甚至对于中国史学界从人民的立场来研究和判断历史，都提供了值得参考的方法，打开了他们研究范围的疆界。就是在古代历史的钻研方面，人们也能够适用毛主席关于必须作调查研究的指示，广泛的从诗歌，小说，故事，笔记绘画等等当时人物所言所行的材料中去发现历史的脚迹。

    杜甫所留下来的诗有一千三四百首，其主题范围非常之广，它触及到历史社会，军事政治，国家个人，人物艺术，山川草木，虫鱼鸟兽。他是中国诗人之中主题内容最丰富的一个。如冯先生所指出的，杜甫诗在内容上的特点，就是紧紧地围绕着社会政治生活的现实。除了冯先生所特别着重推荐的“三吏”“三别”“北征”等直接写人民生活的诗篇之外，就是他的一些抒写个人，借古人以况自己的诗篇如《谒先主庙》，如咏怀古迹中关于庾信的诗，也都是从忧国忧民，痛惜自己于时无补的感情出发，而远不是一种琐细卑微的自我陶醉。这种爱国家爱人民的热情贯穿他的一生，冯至所引证的他的许多诗篇证明了这一点。就是冯先生所不大赞成的“八哀诗”，“诸将”，甚至连从头至尾都是音乐，而且运用了许多象征性词藻的“秋兴”八首，也莫不充溢着现实的内容。只消一读“秋兴”第六首，就可以充分领会：
    瞿塘峡口曲江头  万里风烟接素秋
    花萼夹城通御气  芙蓉小苑入边愁
    珠帘绣柱围黄鹄  锦缆牙樯起白鸥
    回首可怜歌舞地  秦中自古帝王州
    中国历史上也有一些诗人写过一些控诉和讽喻他们的时代的诗，但是直接讽刺皇帝像杜甫这一首诗以及这本传记中所引用过的其他几首诗所表现的，都是不多。他一贯地从爱国家爱人民出发的现实主义使他不能不看到国家和人民的灾难的主要负责者就是那些皇帝们。即使他从儒家教育得来的所谓忠厚爱君之道也不能使他对这些统治者不说话。
    尽管杜甫的诗包罗万象，艺术迷人，“爱国诗人杜甫传”却抓紧了杜甫的主要精神，主要关键之所在，肯定诗人的爱国主义及其对人民的热爱。作者的这个论断对于诗人是充分恰当，对于我们分析和了解历史上的人物方面，是有很大的教育意义的。对于如何接受文学遗产，特别是旧中国知识分子的文学作品，这里有了一个初步的尝试。旧中国的知识分子作家，除了少数人而外，几几乎全是和封建统治阶级有血肉渊源，其思想内容大致不出儒道两家的范围，有的杂些佛教思想。他们或多或少都需要为统治王朝服务以求生活下去。这是他们属于剥削阶级阵营的一方面。但是另一方面，他们又不能不接触人民的痛苦，接触了就不能不发生思想和感情。同时，最重要的是他们自己也不能不受统治王朝的剥削和压迫。他们一面是剥削者，一面又是被剥削者。这种矛盾常常表现为他们的诗的两面性，一面是急于求进身做官的欲望，另一面是对现实的痛苦与不合理的深沉感触，有的发为控诉，多数则采取了逃避态度。杜甫也是有这样的两面性的。冯至在这本著作里正当地指出了杜甫的诗里所包涵的两面性，但同时根据诗中主要的，一贯的关心人民痛苦与国家灾难的一方面，肯定他是爱国家爱人民的伟大诗人。这是正确的。
        ×    ×    ×
    本书的一点缺点，是对杜甫在中国诗的艺术史上的地位和作用，说得太少。这个爱国家爱人民的大诗人在中国诗的传统里面究竟占了怎样一个地位，起着怎样一种作用呢？他在我们的诗传统中继承了一些什么，发挥了一些什么呢？由于篇幅的限制，或是其他原因，可能作者是有意把它放下来了的。但是从研究和了解杜甫研究和了解中国诗史的需要来说，我们即不能不希望本书的作者和其他作者来弥补这个欠缺。
