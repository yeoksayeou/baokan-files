　　Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Dynamics
            New Look of Welfare Work in Northeast China
    Since the launch of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the welfare work in various parts of Northeast China has taken on a new look due to the importance attached by leaders at all levels and the improvement of the masses' political awareness. In rural areas, in order to improve the efficiency of substitute farming and ensure output, the system of fixed and dedicated contract farming has been generally implemented in various places, and on this basis, the method of signing substitute farming contracts has been further strengthened and promoted. In particular, with the improvement and increase of production mutual aid groups, the number of contract farming groups has increased unprecedentedly. For example, in Acheng, Songjiang, there were 1,690 mutual aid groups last year, which increased sharply to 2,398 groups this year; in Shuangcheng, Hulan, Wuchang and other counties, more than 90% of the mutual aid groups are engaged in contract farming. These all specifically demonstrate the mutual aid significance of substitute farming, and have a positive effect on developing production and leading the families of martyrs and soldiers from participating in mutual aid group production to self-sufficiency and then to a prosperous life. In cities, various localities have vigorously organized and introduced production and employment for the families of martyrs and soldiers through municipal and district people's representative conferences, forums for civil affairs cadres in urban areas, and support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-families committees. For example, in Shenyang, the four districts organized more than 20 large and small factories for clothing, knitting, etc. in half a year, employing more than 350 family members of martyrs and soldiers. They also used military family agency stores, chemical factories, and other profitable ventures to support the sideline businesses of the families of martyrs and soldiers, increasing the income of more than 230 families of martyrs and soldiers. Due to the care of the government and the masses and their active participation in production, the living standards of the families of martyrs and soldiers in Northeast China have rapidly increased, and their social status has also been greatly improved.
    After the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea issued three major appeals, people's organizations in Northeast China made specific arrangements, and people from all walks of life responded enthusiastically. In order to further improve the welfare work on this basis, governments at all levels organized a major inspection of the welfare work, and a mass movement was formed from "June 1st" to "August 1st" in both urban and rural areas. In Tai'an County, Heilongjiang Province alone, 120 cadres were organized to inspect the substitute farming work in the entire county. Yu Yifu, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government, personally led 50 cadres to conduct inspections in Qiqihar City. Governments at all levels in Northeast China and the broad masses of people attach great importance to this inspection movement of welfare work, and are prepared to solve the problems discovered in the inspection as soon as possible, and plan to generally rectify the organization of the support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-families committees around "August 1st", in order to mobilize and consolidate the people's enthusiasm for welfare, and more effectively improve the lives and social status of the families of martyrs and soldiers.
            Shaanxi Province Organizes Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Propaganda Team
    During the period from April to June, the leading organs of Shaanxi Province organized several cadres from provincial-level organs and groups to form the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Propaganda Team twice, touring various counties and cities to carry out propaganda and inspection work for the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement. The first task of the team was mainly to promote the "May 1st" demonstration and propaganda movement; the second task was mainly to inspect the situation of the "May 1st" propaganda movement. When the propaganda team toured various places to carry out propaganda and inspection, it carried propaganda vehicles, movies, photos, popular readings, leaflets and other propaganda tools, and adopted methods such as train propaganda, meetings, symposiums, movie screenings, broadcasting, photo exhibitions, distribution of leaflets and readings, chats, storytelling, teaching songs and other literary and artistic forms to carry out propaganda in cooperation with the local propaganda forces, and conducted investigations in rural areas to understand the rural propaganda situation. The Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Propaganda Team of Shaanxi Province played a considerable role in promoting the propaganda work of the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea in various parts of the province. This method is worth adopting in various places.
            Guangzhou's Donation Movement Achieves Considerable Results
    Since the launch of the patriotic increase production and donation movement in Guangzhou, it has achieved considerable results. In the first 20 days of the donation movement, cadres of various agencies in the city alone donated more than 11 billion yuan, housewives donated nearly 3 billion yuan, workers donated more than 5 billion yuan, and the industrial and commercial circles also decided to donate more than 40 billion yuan. In this donation movement, people from all walks of life in Guangzhou showed their patriotic enthusiasm. The industrial and commercial circles have made progress compared with previous donations, especially after listening to the reports of the returning representatives of the volunteers, some said that they would be sorry for the volunteers if they did not work hard to donate. Guangzhou's production increase and donation movement is still developing and is expected to achieve greater results.
    Guangzhou also has some shortcomings in carrying out the donation movement. The first is that it has not carried out patriotic ideological education universally and deeply in the movement, so that everyone can donate completely on the basis of self-consciousness and voluntariness. The second is that it is not closely combined with increasing production and improving management, and the number of people who have formulated production increase and donation plans is still not large, and a mass production increase and donation movement has not yet been formed. These shortcomings have already attracted the attention of Guangzhou's leaders.

　　抗美援朝动态
            东北优抚工作的新面貌
    东北各地的优抚工作，自开展抗美援朝运动以来，由于各级领导机关的重视和群众政治觉悟的提高，出现了新的面貌。在农村中，为了提高代耕效率，保证产量，各地普遍实行了固定专责的包耕制，并在此基础上进一步加强与推广了订代耕合同的办法。尤其是伴随着生产互助组的提高与增加，包耕组空前增多。如松江阿城去年有一千六百九十个互助组，今年激增至二千三百九十八个组；双城、呼兰、五常等县互助组包耕的占百分之九十以上。这些都具体地表现了代耕的互助意义，对发展生产与带动烈属军属由参加互助组生产自给进而走上生活富裕，有着积极作用。在城市中，各地通过市、区人民代表会议、城区民政干部座谈会、拥军优属委员会等，大力组织、介绍烈属军属生产就业。如沈阳市四个区半年内共组织了被服、针织等大小工厂二十余处，收容三百五十多名烈属军属生产就业，并以军属代理店、化学厂等营利扶植烈、军属家庭副业，使二百三十多户烈属军属增加了收入。东北各地烈属军属由于政府和群众的照顾及自己积极参加生产，生活水平迅速上升，社会地位也大为提高。
    抗美援朝总会发出三大号召后，东北各人民团体又作了具体布置，各界人民群起响应。各级政府为在此基础上进一步提高优抚工作，即组织了优抚工作的大检查，从“六一”到“八一”，无论城市和农村都形成了群众运动。仅黑龙江泰安一县，即组织了一百二十名干部检查全县代耕工作。黑龙江省人民政府主席于毅夫亲率五十名干部在齐齐哈尔市检查。东北各级政府及广大群众对这次优抚工作的检查运动，都十分重视，准备尽速解决在检查中所发现的问题，并计划在“八一”前后普遍把各地拥军优属委员会的组织整顿起来，用以发动和巩固人民的优抚热情，更有效地提高烈属军属的生活和社会地位。
            陕西省组抗美援朝宣传团
    陕西省领导机关在四月至六月期间，曾由省级各机关团体抽调若干干部两次组织抗美援朝宣传团，巡行各县、市进行抗美援朝运动的宣传检查工作。该团第一次主要是推动“五一”示威宣传运动；第二次主要是检查“五一”宣传运动情况。宣传团在巡行各地进行宣传检查时，携带了宣传车、电影、照片、通俗读物、传单等宣传工具，采取了列车宣传，集会，座谈，放映电影，播音，照片展览，散发传单、读物，拉话，说快板，教歌曲及其他文艺形式进行宣传，配合了当地宣传力量，开展工作，深入农村作了调查，了解了农村宣传情况。陕西省抗美援朝宣传团对推动该省各地开展抗美援朝的宣传工作起了相当作用。这种方式值得各地采取。
            广州市的捐献运动获相当成绩
    爱国增产捐献运动在广州市开展以来，业已获得相当成绩。在捐献运动开展的头二十天内，仅全市各机关干部就捐献了一百一十多亿元，家庭妇女捐了近三十亿，工人捐了五十多亿，工商界也决定要捐到四百多亿元。在这次捐献运动当中，广州市各阶层人民都表现了爱国的热情。工商界比过去历次捐献的表现都有进步，尤其是当他们听了志愿军归国代表的报告后，有的表示不努力捐献就对不住志愿军。广州市的增产捐献运动还在继续发展，估计将会获得更大的成绩。
    广州市在开展捐献运动中也还有些缺点，第一就是没有在运动中普遍深入地进行爱国主义的思想教育，使每个人都完全在自觉自愿的基础上捐献。第二就是没有密切与增加生产、改善经营等相结合，现已订出增产捐献计划的为数还不多，还未形成群众性的增产捐献运动。这些缺点已经引起广州市领导方面的注意。
