Editor's Note: The construction of the Shijiazhuang Sugar Factory failed due to subjectivist problems in the leadership's thinking. Comrade Chen Guangyu, the factory director, has conscientiously summarized the lessons of this construction work and has begun to identify the correct policy for building the factory. This is a strong guarantee for the factory to do a good job in future construction work. We hope that responsible comrades in charge of capital construction in various factories, mines, and municipal construction departments can also seriously summarize the capital construction work they are responsible for; such a summary is of great educational significance for the staff of factories and mines nationwide.

　　In the spring of 1949, the New China Economic Construction Company (hereinafter referred to as the Economic Construction Company) established a sugar factory in Shijiazhuang. Because of our insufficient understanding of the basic principles of scientific capital construction—design before construction—we adopted the erroneous policy of designing and constructing simultaneously. For two years, we operated without profit and suffered losses. After reading the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee's notice on strictly inspecting capital construction and the People's Daily's discussion on capital construction issues, I am willing to summarize the capital construction work of the sugar factory with a learning attitude, accept past lessons, and do a good job in the future.

　　The Motivation and Basis for Building the Sugar Factory

　　In October 1948, after the liberation of Jinan, responsible comrades from the Economic Construction Company and the Agricultural College of North China University (hereinafter referred to as the Agricultural College) went to Jinan to visit industry. In the courtyard of the Huangtai Alcohol Factory, they saw some sugar-making machines that were eroded by wind and rain and incomplete. These old machines used to process 500 tons of sugar beets per day. In the past, we used manual sugar making in the mountain gullies of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, which had been blockaded by the enemy for a long time, to overcome the difficulty of sugar shortages. At this time, seeing these machines, we were very envious. We wanted to use these old machines to build a mechanized sugar factory capable of processing 50 tons of sugar beets per day, to restore and develop the country's industry and to solve the problem of sugar supply for the people. This idea was approved by the relevant leading organs in East China. So we transported these machines to Shijiazhuang to set up a factory, because at that time we thought that Shijiazhuang had coal, iron, land, convenient transportation, and was suitable for running industry.

　　In March 1949, the Economic Construction Company and the Agricultural College held a meeting to decide on cooperation in running the sugar factory. The main contents of the cooperation were: the Agricultural College was responsible for sugar beet cultivation and for factory design and sugar-making technology, and the sugar factory would serve as an internship factory for the Agricultural College; the Economic Construction Company was responsible for raising funds and factory management. Cadres of the Economic Construction Company could go to the Agricultural College to learn scientific knowledge, and the Agricultural College could help the Economic Construction Company train cadres. At that time, it was decided to start production in November 1949. That is to say, a sugar factory had to be built in just six months. After this hasty and eager-to-achieve-success policy was determined, 700 mu of sugar beets were planted in April. In May, while preparing to build the factory building, we happened to encounter the closure of the Shijiazhuang Coking Branch, so we purchased and pieced together the site of the Coking Branch, received nearly a hundred workers, and began to build the factory. In early June, we began to transport machines from Shandong. At this time, we discovered that only about 20 percent of the machines from Shandong could be used for the entire sugar factory. The remaining 80 percent needed to be manufactured from scratch.

　　Work Situation in the Past Two Years

　　(1) Losses of 400 Million Yuan in 1949

　　The Agricultural College, responsible for solving engineering technology, only sent half an engineer (who had to lecture in the mechanical engineering department of the college for half the time) to design the factory. This engineer lacked theoretical knowledge of sugar-making machinery and had no practical experience in designing sugar factories. In addition, the project was complex, so he could only think one step and take one step. During construction, rework, backfilling, and waiting for materials often occurred, affecting the morale of workers and wasting manpower and materials. After starting work in January 1950, many problems occurred, such as:

　　1.　The design of the horizontal maceration tank was incorrect, and the sugar beet pulp could not get out once it went in. Sheet metal from gasoline drums was used as a partition; when the machine vibrated, the partition fell off, and work was often stopped for repairs, affecting production.

　　2.　The condenser was installed on the ground (actually it should be raised more than eleven meters above the ground), and the steam could not condense into water, so it could not evaporate the sugar water.

　　3.　The cold water pool, built of bricks, was built above the ground without calculating the water pressure. After being filled with water, the pool collapsed!

　　4.　The amount of steam used was not calculated, and the steam was insufficient, so we temporarily borrowed a locomotive from the railway locomotive depot to supply steam.

　　5.　The well water from the two-inch water pump was not enough for the entire factory, so we had to use the wastewater from the power plant.

　　6.　Because we were busy rushing to work, the pipes connecting the various parts of the manufactured machines leaked steam and water, consuming steam and losing sugar water.

　　As a result of this blind and chaotic work, the sugar production rate was only 40 percent of the total plan, the sugar extraction rate was only 4 percent, and the loss was about 400 million yuan in RMB.

　　(2) Losses of 1.5 Billion Yuan in 1950

　　After summarizing the work in 1949 in March 1950, it was believed that the sugar factory should continue to be repaired, but the following work must be carried out:

　　1.　Establish a design committee to be specifically responsible for machine modification and design work. Add three technical design personnel to strengthen technical design.

　　2.　In order to reduce costs, the daily processing volume of 50 tons of sugar beets must be increased to 150 tons.

　　3.　Add machine house equipment, boilers, water wells, and water pools.

　　4.　Cancel the horizontal immersion tank and change it to a vertical immersion tank.

　　5.　Visit and learn from the advanced experience of sugar factories in Northeast China.

　　6.　Work under the guidance of the Ministry of Food Industry.

　　In the spring of 1950, another 4,000 mu of sugar beets were planted, and it was planned to start production in November. After we visited the sugar factories in Northeast China in April, we started to transform the machines in May. The machines and housing equipment to be changed and newly built accounted for 80 percent of the original equipment. After the preliminary plan for the project design was determined, local construction was carried out without detailed design. In September, the wind pack was test-driven, and due to design errors, the steel plate used was too thin and there were no tie rods. Violations of technical regulations in operation resulted in a tragic explosion, killing one technician, one skilled worker, and injuring five others. The factory fell into chaos. After inspection and handling by the higher-level leading organs, the installation project continued. At that time, we saw that the sugar beets were about to be harvested, but less than half of the machines had been completed. Only then did we realize that the scheduled project progress plan had made a subjectivist error. The entire project was estimated to be too easy, and the time required for each stage of accessories, installation, insulation, and test driving was neglected. In order to save the sugar beets from rotting and loss, we specially requested Mr. Tian, the chief engineer who had experience in restoring sugar factories from Harbin, and ten other engineers to come to the factory to assist in the rush repair. After Mr. Tian arrived at the factory, he saw that the situation was urgent and it was impossible to carry out the design. He could only install the original design and decided to transform it after the sugar was made. With the help of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal People's Government, and the Economic Construction Company's General and Branch Companies, more than 200 workers from more than a dozen public and private iron factories in Beijing and Shijiazhuang were mobilized to rush repairs and started work in the second half of January 1951. However, due to the poor design of the machines and the sugar beets being stored for too long and suffering serious damage, the sugar extraction rate was still only 4 percent, and the total output was still only 40 percent of the original production plan. The loss in 1950 amounted to 1.5 billion yuan in RMB.

　　Lessons from Failure

　　(1) Our policy of building a sugar factory in Shijiazhuang was fundamentally wrong. The error lies in simply starting from the needs of the country and the people, without considering whether the subjective and objective conditions are available.

　　After two years of practice, we have explored that the construction of a modern mechanized sugar factory must have the following basic conditions:

　　1.　The natural conditions of the factory area, such as soil, climate, rainfall, and day and night temperature differences, are suitable for the growth of sugar beets. The land area is sufficient, and the cost of sugar beets is not high.

　　2.　There is no problem with water sources.

　　3.　Transportation is convenient.

　　4.　Fuel supply is convenient.

　　5.　The quality of limestone must be good.

　　6.　The factory building is strong and practical. (Because sugar-making machines are very bulky, attention must be paid to the land's load-bearing capacity and vibration force.)

　　Now let's look at the conditions of the Shijiazhuang Sugar Factory!

　　Before deciding to build the sugar factory, we did not conduct any investigation or research on the above situation. Two years of experience have told us that although Shijiazhuang City is suitable for general industrial requirements in terms of transportation, fuel, and limestone, it does not have the basic conditions for establishing a sugar factory. The natural conditions in Shijiazhuang are not suitable for the growth of sugar beets: there is little rain in May, June, and July, which is prone to insect disasters; there is a lot of rain in August and September, which is prone to diseases, and the sugar beet roots and hearts rot, especially the leaves are almost completely rotten, and when new leaves grow again, sugar is lost; in October, due to too much rain, they only grow in volume and do not grow in sugar. The sugar content of sugar beets cannot only not be concentrated, but also diluted by rainwater. Generally, sugar beets grow very large, but the sugar content is not as high as in Northeast China. In 1949, the sugar beets we planted had an average sugar content of 13.5 percent; in 1950, the average was only 10 percent, while the sugar beets in Northeast China contained about 15 percent sugar.

　　Shijiazhuang is a cotton-producing area, and the People's Government calls for a large increase in cotton production. Promoting sugar beets will compete with cotton for land, which is in conflict with the policy of increasing cotton production. At the same time, it will inevitably increase the price of sugar beets. In Shijiazhuang, 1,000 yuan can only buy six catties of sugar beets; in Northeast China, you can buy about ten catties. The raw material of sugar beets accounts for a major proportion of the cost of sugar, which is a condition that should be considered first when building a factory. At the same time, sugar beets are a rotation crop, and you must have more than three times the land area to rotate them, which is a major difficulty in terms of land area.

　　The Shijiazhuang Sugar Factory does not rely on rivers, and production must use well water. Using more well water will inevitably increase costs. Without relying on rivers, the discharge of wastewater and waste residue will also become a problem.

　　In addition, the factory building also has major problems. As mentioned earlier, sugar factories need to build very strong factory buildings, but we used warehouses for storing cotton. Installing machines in such a factory building is like cutting your feet to fit the shoes. It is not the factory building that matches the machines, but the machines that adapt to the house. The result of the adaptation is to build houses on the roof and add walls outside, but the foundation of the wall is only three feet deep, and there is water everywhere. Because each department has pipes connected, many holes have been dug in the wall to pass the pipes. When the machine vibrates, the walls are out of shape and cracked.

　　(2) Our reliance on the Agricultural College to solve technical problems was also wrong. The error lies in starting construction hastily without correct design.

　　Sugar factories include several complex production departments such as agriculture, machinery, electrical engineering, thermal power, chemical engineering, sugar making, and civil engineering construction. Sufficient theoretical knowledge, rich experience, and a sufficient number of technical personnel must work together to carry out design work. We adopted the method of cooperating with the Agricultural College and having the Agricultural College solve technical problems. However, the Agricultural College only sent one engineer with no experience in designing sugar factories to design the sugar factory, and this one engineer still had to lecture at the Agricultural College for half the time. This approach seems very absurd today. We ourselves do not understand technology, and blindly rely on the Agricultural College to solve technical problems. The problems cannot be solved. This is something that our leading comrades should review. Although we had a preliminary understanding that we must solve technical problems in the second year, the understanding was not deep enough. Under the condition of a great shortage of technical personnel, we only invited three engineers (in fact, their experience was also very insufficient) and wanted to succeed by chance. Our thinking has not yet escaped blindness. For such a huge renovation plan, we did not correctly calculate whether we were technically sure, how much manpower was needed, how long it would take, and how much funding was needed. We listened to the opinions of the technical personnel and made a decision lightly. The technical personnel had no grasp of the project design and treated the factory as a laboratory. For example, the horizontal immersion tank, there is no such machine in China, and there are no detailed design drawings in foreign reference books, but we rashly adopted it. This is an irresponsible attitude towards the people's property and is also worth deep reflection.

　　(3) Planting sugar beets first and making machines later is the third error. The error lies in being eager to achieve success.

　　It takes three to four years from the design to the start of production of a sugar factory. During this period, it is necessary to test-plant sugar beets in a planned way, design and construct in a planned way (including manufacturing, installing machines, building houses), use funds and order machine materials in a planned way, and train technical personnel and skilled workers in a planned way. With sufficient preparation, we can ensure smooth production. At the end of 1948 and the beginning of 1949, we had no factory base, no factory buildings, no sufficient water and electrical equipment and machine equipment, and no technical strength; under the conditions that Tianjin and Beijing were about to be liberated and Shanghai had not yet been liberated, and the purchase of equipment and materials was very difficult, we first planted sugar beets (once sugar beets are planted, they must be put into production in the same year, otherwise they will rot and be damaged), and attempted to build a sugar factory in half a year. We just did it at that time. Now thinking about it, it's really chilling, it's too risky!

　　(4) No budget for funds, request as needed; no plan for procurement, running around everywhere.

　　The use of factory funds had no plan. Temporary funds were requested temporarily, which affected the overall capital allocation plan of the company. In terms of procurement, electrical materials and hardware materials were purchased batch after batch, and it was not known how much to buy. We ran around everywhere in Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing, and Northeast China. For some things, such as steam valves, steam pipes, and electric switches, the same specifications were purchased three or four times. Due to the urgent need, some of the things that were bought back were not up to specifications, and some were too expensive, which wasted a lot of manpower and financial resources.

　　(5) Blindly trust private manufacturers.

　　The machines used for sugar making, such as centrifuges, vertical water pumps, and boilers, could not be manufactured by ourselves and had to be ordered from other places. Private manufacturers failed to complete the delivery quality and time according to the plan, which also increased our many difficulties. For example, the four-steam bag circulating water tube boiler that we ordered from Shanghai Sifang Iron Factory through the introduction of the East China Industrial Department was determined to generate 14,000 pounds of steam per hour, but the efficiency could not meet the standard, and production was often stopped due to insufficient steam during sugar making. The coal feeder broke down before it even started working. The four separators ordered from Harbin Yuexin Iron Factory not only exceeded the delivery date by nearly two months, but also could not operate normally due to insufficient horsepower. These things have taught us: in the future, we must have preparation time for ordering goods, and do not plan to use them as soon as they are taken. We must have time to test the machine's performance and repair it, otherwise it will cause difficulties.

　　Our ideological understanding

　　We were not prepared for building a sugar factory in Shijiazhuang, and there was an extremely serious blindness. We did not conduct investigation and research, did not formulate a detailed plan, did not design before construction, and did not even seriously consider how much force was needed to organize a modern mechanized sugar factory, what conditions were needed, and what problems needed to be solved. We only blindly believed some people's claim that "we are absolutely sure of the technology." It was truly blind and ignorant to the extreme!

　　Chairman Mao said: Science is learned honestly. Our cooperation with the Agricultural College to run the sugar factory was blindly adventurous, not seeking truth from facts, and not proceeding from reality. It was unscientific, dishonest, and imprudent. This is the guerrilla style brought from the countryside, operating industry in a handicraft way, that is, narrow empiricism. We made the mistake of unconditional optimism and also contracted the acute illness of being eager to achieve success by chance. Due to this erroneous thinking, we also did a very poor job in factory management democratization and enterprise management. We were busy dealing with temporary affairs all day long, trembling and fearing accidents, losing sight of the other, and being passive everywhere. We could not spare time to study theory. This way, we could not accept new things and summarize experience well. Until this spring, we were still planning to plant sugar beets again and prepare for production. Under the unanimous call to renovate machines and build new factory buildings, after Mr. Tian's calculation, we knew that the task could not be completed within a year, so we decided not to plant sugar beets this year (only for experimental purposes) and stop production. The Economic Construction Company and the Ministry of Light Industry also instructed us to conduct investigation and research for three or four months, and then re-examine and decide on the policy of the sugar factory. After receiving this instruction, we went to Guangzhou and sugar factories in Northeast China to conduct on-the-spot inspections and study the issue of factory construction. This inspired us to open up our narrow circles, accept experience from all aspects, and study and determine the future construction policy of the sugar factory, and reported to the Central Ministry of Light Industry and the Economic Construction Company.

　　In the past two years, all the workers, technicians, and administrative cadres of our factory have made the greatest efforts to complete the task. We worked day and night, trying every means to overcome difficulties, such as: insufficient steam, borrowed locomotives from the railway locomotive depot to supply steam; insufficient water volume, used wastewater from the power plant, etc. But the result was powerless and things went against our wishes. This shows that no matter how good your starting point for running a factory is, and no matter how high your enthusiasm is, if you make the mistake of subjectivism, the result will only be failure. Chairman Mao has taught us in On Practice: "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to obtain the expected results, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice." "After failing, people also learn lessons from failure, correct their thinking to suit the laws of the external world, and people can turn failure into victory." The general manager and deputy general manager of our company also often cited the failure of the sugar factory as a painful lesson in cadre meetings and work summaries, conducting self-criticism and review, and calling on all cadres of the company to accept this experience and lesson. We gradually made some corrections in our subsequent actions.

　　After accepting the lessons of the past, we will use them to guide our future factory construction work to compensate for the previous serious losses. However, due to the limitations of personal ideological level, the understanding of the lessons of the sugar factory is not deep and comprehensive enough. This is only a preliminary review. I sincerely ask comrades for criticism and correction.

　　主观主义必然造成恶果
    ——石家庄糖厂建厂失败给我的教训
    石家庄糖厂厂长  陈光宇
    编者按：石家庄糖厂建厂工作由于领导思想上存在着主观主义的毛病而归于失败。该厂厂长陈光宇同志认真地总结了这次建厂工作的教训，开始找出了建设该厂的正确方针，这就是该厂今后做好建厂工作的有力保证。我们希望各地厂矿及市政建设部门的负责同志，都能这样认真地把自己负责的基本建设工作加以总结；这种总结，对于全国各厂矿工作人员有重要的教育意义。
    一九四九年春，新中国经济建设公司（以下简称经建公司），在石家庄成立了一个制糖厂。由于我们对科学的基本建设方针——先设计后施工认识不足，采取了一面设计一面施工的错误方针，两年来经营无利，反遭亏累。读了政务院财政经济委员会关于严格检查基本建设的通知及人民日报刊登的对于基本建设问题的讨论以后，我愿以学习的态度来总结制糖厂的基本建设工作，接受过去的教训，做好今后的工作。
    办糖厂的动机和根据
    一九四八年十月济南解放后，经建公司与华北大学农学院（以下简称农学院）负责同志往济南参观工业。在黄台酒精厂的院子里，看到一部分被风雨剥蚀、残缺不全的制糖机器。这破旧机器过去是每天处理五百吨甜菜的。过去，我们在敌人长期封锁的陕甘宁边区的山沟里，曾用手工制糖来克服食糖缺乏的困难。这时，见到了这些机器，非常羡慕。很想利用这些旧机器，建设一个每天处理五十吨甜菜的机械化糖厂，为国家恢复发展工业，为人民解决食糖供给问题。这个意见得到了华东有关领导机关的同意。我们就把这部分机器运到石家庄来设厂，因为当时想着石家庄有煤、有铁、有地，交通便利，是适合于办工业的。
    一九四九年三月，经建公司与农学院开会决定分工合作办糖厂。分工合作的主要内容是：农学院负责甜菜栽培，负责设厂与制糖技术，糖厂就作为农学院的实习工厂；经建公司负责筹拨资金及工厂管理。经建公司的干部可以到农学院去学习科学知识，农学院可以帮助经建公司培养干部。当时决定于一九四九年十一月开工生产。即是说：只用半年时间就要办起一个糖厂来。这一急于求成的方针确定以后，四月份就种下了七百亩甜菜。五月份正准备建筑厂房时，恰遇石家庄炼焦分厂结束，我们便购买和凑合了炼焦分厂的厂址，接收了近百名工友，开始进行建厂。六月初开始从山东搬运机器。这时，才发现山东的机器能够使用的仅占整个糖厂机器的百分之二十左右。其余百分之八十需要从新赶工制造。
    两年来的工作情况
    （一）一九四九年亏损四亿元
    负责解决工程技术的农学院只派来了半个工程师（他一半时间要给该院机械系讲课）来设计工厂。这位工程师缺乏制糖机械的理论知识，更没有设计糖厂的实际经验。加以工程复杂，就只能想一步、做一步。在施工中经常发生返工背料与停工待料的情形，影响工人情绪，浪费人力物力。在一九五○年一月开工后发生了许多问题，如：
    １，卧式浸丝罐设计错误，甜菜丝进去了出不来。用汽油桶铁皮做隔板；机器一震动，隔板就掉了，经常停工修理，影响生产。
    ２，凝结器装在地面上（实际应升高地平十一公尺以上），蒸汽无法凝结成水，不能起蒸发糖水的作用。
    ３，用砖砌的冷水池子，建筑在地面之上，没有计算水的压力，盛满水后，水池子坍掉了！
    ４，使用蒸汽量没有计算，蒸汽不够，临时借用了铁路机务段的火车头来供给蒸汽。
    ５，二英寸水泵的井水，不够全厂使用，不得已使用了发电厂的废水。
    ６，因忙于赶工，制造出来的机器各连接部分的管子泄汽漏水，消耗蒸汽，损失糖水。
    这样盲目乱干的结果，产糖率仅占总计划的百分之四十，出糖率仅达百分之四，亏损了人民币约四亿元。
    （二）一九五○年亏损十五亿元
    一九五○年三月总结了一九四九年的工作后，认为糖厂应该继续修复，但必须进行下列工作：
    １，成立设计委员会，专门负责机器改装设计工作。增加技术设计人员三名，加强技术设计。
    ２，为了减低成本，必须把每天处理五十吨甜菜的生产量扩大至一百五十吨。
    ３，添加机器房屋设备、汽锅、水井、水池子。
    ４，把卧式浸丝罐取消，改成立式浸丝罐。
    ５，到东北糖厂参观学习东北先进经验。
    ６，在食品工业部指导下进行工作。
    一九五○年春又种了四千亩甜菜，计划十一月开工生产。四月我们参观东北糖厂回来后，五月就着手进行改造机器工作。要改变与新建的机器及房屋设备，占原设备百分之八十。在工程设计定出了初步计划后，没有详细设计，就进行局部施工。九月份风包试车，因设计错误，所用钢板太薄，又无拉条，操作上违反了技术规程，发生了爆炸惨案，死技师一人、技工一人，伤五人，工厂陷于混乱状态。经上级领导机关组织检查、处理以后，又继续进行安装工程。当时眼看着甜菜即将收获，而机器尚未完成半数。这才发现所定工程进度计划，犯了主观主义的错误。对整个工程估计得太容易，忽视了配件、安装、保温、试车等每个阶段都需要较长的时间。为挽救甜菜不致遭受腐烂损失，我们特向哈尔滨市请恢复糖厂有经验的田总工程师等十位工程师，来厂协助抢修。田总工程师到厂后，看到情况紧急，已无法进行设计，只能把原设计的安装起来，决定在制完糖后再进行改造。在中共石家庄市委、市人民政府及经建公司总、分公司帮助下，动员了北京、石家庄市十余家公私营铁工厂的二百名工人来厂抢修，于一九五一年一月下半月开工。但是，因机器设计不良，甜菜保存过久而遭受严重损坏，出糖率仍仅达百分之四，总产量也仍然只占原生产计划的百分之四十。一九五○年亏损人民币达十五亿元。
    失败中的教训
    （一）我们在石家庄办糖厂的方针根本就是错误的。错误在于单纯从国家与人民需要出发，而未考虑主观客观的条件是否具备。
    经过两年的实践，我们摸索到建设现代机械化的糖厂必须具备下列各种基本条件：
    １，建厂地区的自然条件如土壤、气候、雨量、昼夜温差等，适合甜菜的生长。土地面积充分，甜菜成本不高。
    ２，水源没有问题。
    ３，交通便利。
    ４，燃料供给方便。
    ５，石灰石的质量要好。
    ６，厂房建筑坚固实用。（因为制糖机器非常笨重，必须注意土地耐压力与震动力。）
    现在我们再来看石家庄糖厂的条件吧！
    我们在决定办糖厂以前，并未对上述情况作调查研究。两年的经验告诉我们，石家庄市虽然在交通、燃料、石灰石方面尚适合于一般工业要求，但并不具备建立糖厂的基本条件。石家庄的自然条件不适合甜菜生长：五、六、七月少雨，易生虫灾；八、九月雨多，易生病害，甜菜根与心发生腐烂，特别是叶子差不多全部烂光，重长新叶子时，又损失了糖分；十月间，又因雨多而光长体积不长糖分，甜菜糖分不仅不能浓缩并且被雨水冲淡了。一般的甜菜个子长的很大，含糖量却没有东北的高。一九四九年我们种的甜菜，平均含糖量为百分之十三点五；一九五○年平均仅为百分之十，而东北的甜菜则含糖百分之十五左右。
    石家庄是产棉区，人民政府号召大量增产棉花。推广甜菜，就要与棉花争地，对于增产棉花政策是有抵触的。同时也势必提高甜菜价格。在石家庄一千元仅买甜菜六斤；在东北则可买到十斤左右。而甜菜这一原料在糖的成本中是占主要比重的，这是建厂时应该首先考虑的一个条件。同时，甜菜是轮作作物，必须要有三倍以上的土地才能轮作过来，在土地面积上又是一个大的困难。
    石家庄糖厂没有依靠河流，生产必须使用井水。多用井水势必增加成本。不依靠河流，废水废粕的排泄也成问题。
    另外，厂房也有很大问题。前面说过，糖厂需要建筑很坚固的厂房，而我们利用的是装棉花的库房。在这样的厂房安装机器，等于削足适履，不是厂房配合机器，而是机器迁就房子。迁就的结果是房上架房，墙外加墙，而墙基仅有三尺深，又到处有水。因各部门都有管子连接，就在墙上挖了许多通管子的窟窿，机器一震动，墙壁有走了样的，有裂了缝的。
    （二）我们依靠农学院解决技术问题也是错误的。错误在于没有正确的设计就仓促施工。
    糖厂包括农业、机械、电机、热力、化工、制糖、土木建筑等数种复杂的生产部门，必须有充分的理论知识、丰富经验与足够数量的技术人员通力合作，始能进行设计工作。我们采取了与农学院合作由农学院解决技术问题的办法。但农学院派来设计糖厂的只有一个没有设计糖厂经验的工程师，而这一个工程师却还有一半时间要在农学院讲课。这种作法，今天看来是非常荒唐的。我们自己不懂技术，盲目地依靠农学院解决技术问题，问题不能解决，这是我们的领导同志应该检讨的。第二年我们虽然已经初步认识到必须解决技术问题，但认识还不够深刻。在技术人员非常缺乏的条件下，只请到了三个工程师（实际上他们的经验也很不够），就想侥幸成功。我们的思想还是没有脱出盲目性的。对于这样庞大的改修计划，技术上是否确有把握，需要多少人力，多长时间，多少资金，没有正确计算，听信了技术人员意见，便轻率地作出决定。而技术人员对于工程设计并没有把握，把工厂当作实验室。如卧式浸丝罐，在中国没有这样的机器，外国的参考书也没有详细设计图，而我们竟冒然采用。这是对人民财产不负责的态度，也值得深刻检讨。
    （三）先种甜菜，后做机器，是第三个错误。错误在于急于求成。
    建设糖厂从设计到开工生产，必须要有三年到四年的时间才能完成。这期间需要有计划地试种甜菜，有计划地设计施工（包括制造，安装机器，盖房子），有计划地使用资金、定购机器材料，有计划地培养技术人员与技术工人等。有了充分准备，才能保证顺利生产。我们在一九四八年底一九四九年初，没有厂基厂房，没有足够的水电设备和机器设备，没有技术力量；在当时平津将解放上海尚未解放，器材采购非常困难的条件下，竟先种下了甜菜（甜菜种下了就非在当年开工生产不可，否则就会腐烂损坏），企图在半年时间内建设起一个糖厂。我们当时居然说干就干。现在想到这儿，真是不寒而慄，实在太冒险了！
    （四）资金无预算，随用随要；采购无计划，到处奔跑。
    工厂资金使用无计划，临时用款临时要，影响了整个公司的资金调拨计划。在采购方面，电气材料和五金器材，买了一批又一批，不知究竟要买多少。在天津、上海、北京、东北到处奔跑。有的东西，如汽门、汽管、电闸，同样的规格就有买三、四次的。由于急用，买回来的东西，有的不合规格，有的价钱太大，损失不少人力和财力。
    （五）盲目相信私营厂商。
    制糖所用的机器，如离心机，立式水泵，锅炉等，自己无力制造，必须要向外埠定购。私营厂商对交货质量和时间不能按计划完成，也增加了我们许多困难。例如：我们经华东工业部介绍在上海四方铁工厂定做的四汽包循环水管锅炉，决定每小时发生蒸汽一万四千磅，结果效率不能达到标准，在制糖中经常因蒸汽不够而停工。送煤机还未开工就坏掉了。哈尔滨悦?铁工厂定做的四个分离机，不仅超过交货日期近两个月，还因马力不足使机器不能正常运转。这些事情教训了我们：今后定货必须有预备时间，不要打算拿来就可使用，要有试验机器效能与修理的时间，否则就会造成困难。
    我们的思想认识
    在石家庄办糖厂，我们的思想是没有准备的，是存在着极端严重的盲目性的。我们没有进行调查研究，没有制订详细计划，没有设计先行施工，甚至对于创办一个现代机械化的糖厂需要组织多少力量、需要具备何种条件、需要解决什么问题，根本没有认真考虑。我们只轻信了某些人“技术上绝对有把握”的说法。真是盲目无知，达于极点！
    毛主席说：科学是老实学。我们与农学院合办糖厂，盲目冒险，不实事求是，不从实际出发，是违反科学的，是不老实不慎重的。这是从农村中带来的游击作风，以手工业方式经营工业，也就是狭隘的经验主义。我们犯了无条件乐观主义的错误，又犯了急于求成侥幸成功的急性病。由于这种错误的思想，使我们在工厂管理民主化和经营企业化方面也做得很差。我们整天忙于应付临时事务，提心吊胆生怕发生事故，顾此失彼，处处被动，更抽不出时间学习理论。这样就不能很好地接受新鲜事物，总结经验。直至今年春天，我们还在计划再种甜菜，准备生产。在大家一致提出改修机器，新建厂房的呼声下，经过田总工程师的计算，知道一年内不能完成任务，我们才决定本年不种甜菜，（仅作试验）停止生产。经建公司与轻工业部又指示我们，要我们用三、四个月的时间，进行调查研究后，从新审查和决定糖厂的方针。我们接到了这个指示以后，即到广州、东北各糖厂去实地考查，研究建厂问题。这样就启发我们打开狭小的圈子，接受各方面的经验，研究确定了糖厂今后建设的方针，并向中央轻工业部及经建公司作了报告。
    两年来，我厂全体工人、技术人员、行政干部为完成任务，作了最大的努力。我们日以继夜地工作，想一切办法克服困难，如：蒸汽不够借用了铁路机务段的火车头来供汽；水量不足，利用发电厂的废水等等。但结果是力不从心，事与愿违。这说明了：不管你办厂的出发点如何好，积极性如何高，若是犯了主观主义的毛病，结果就只有失败。毛主席在实践论中已经教导我们：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。”“人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利。”本公司总经理和副总经理，在干部会议上，在工作总结中，也经常引糖厂的失败为惨痛的教训，进行自我批评与检讨，号召全公司干部，接受这次经验教训。我们在后来的行动中逐渐地有了若干改正。
    我们在接受了过去的经验教训以后，将用以指导我们今后的建厂工作，以补偿前此的严重损失。但由于个人思想水平的限制，对糖厂教训的认识，尚不够深刻与全面。这只是初步的检讨。我诚恳地要求同志们批评、指正。
