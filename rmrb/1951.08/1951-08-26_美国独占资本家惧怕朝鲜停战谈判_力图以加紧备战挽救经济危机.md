　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 19th (TASS): The United States is currently intensifying its arms expansion movement. In recent weeks, the Department of Defense and other government agencies have indicated that they want to prevent "shrinking" of military production and have called for accelerating arms expansion. "Business Week" reported that the government is trying to obtain an additional $15 billion in military appropriations in addition to the $70 billion guaranteed by various bills currently being discussed in Congress.

　　The argument used to justify the arms expansion movement is often that the United States is facing a serious threat and should guard against it, etc. However, exclusive reports in bourgeois newspapers for limited readership have a more sober discussion, revealing the more real reasons for this war hysteria in Washington. First, an arms expansion program at the current level cannot prevent the "shrinkage" of several daily necessities industries. Second, the government fears that correcting this situation could put it in a disadvantageous position in next year's presidential election. The first reason is the most serious.

　　Despite spending billions of dollars to artificially maintain the U.S. economy and expand Wall Street profits, the crisis of overproduction still threatens several industrial sectors, which have had to reduce production. The industrial production index published by the Federal Reserve, which fell from 223 points in May to 215 points in July, reflects this trend. The total value of goods accumulated in the hands of industrialists and commercial companies increased from $54.2 billion in June 1950 to $70.4 billion in June 1951. Along with the increase in inventory, retail trade decreased. "The National City Bank of New York" bulletin wrote: "Because trade continued to stagnate in July, industrialists are even more eager to take firm measures to overcome difficulties, more willing to limit production, hoping to eliminate the phenomenon of excessive inventory. The shrinkage of production has expanded to the textile, footwear, and furniture industries. At the same time, except for hardware, the wholesale prices of all other items continue to fall..." The "Journal of Commerce" also came to the conclusion, pointing out: "In many industrial sectors, in order to prevent further oversupply in the market, the production of durable consumer goods has been drastically reduced." "New York Times" reporter Raskin published a series of articles on the military production program. In one article, he wrote: "What worries manufacturers and companies that distribute goods now is not so much the lack of goods, but how to sell the existing goods. The demand for televisions is so small that industrialists cannot sell their goods. Many brands of cars can be bought at prices lower than the official price. A similar situation exists in almost all industrial sectors." As a result of the reduction in production, unemployment has recently increased. On August 16, the Department of Labor released data stating that the number of non-agricultural workers decreased by 200,000 from mid-June to mid-July. Unemployment has increased in industries that produce consumer goods, especially in the manufacture of radios, televisions, refrigerators, and household appliances. According to available materials, this production "shrinkage" continued in August. On August 16, the Association of American Railroads reported that railway freight transport in the week ending the 16th decreased by 4.5 percent compared with the same period last year. According to the Federal Reserve, department store trade in the four weeks ending August 11 decreased by 11 percent compared with the same month last year, when consumers were frantically buying goods as a result of the Korean War.

　　Whenever the U.S. economy encounters difficulties, the Truman administration adopts a frequently used method: increasing military appropriations. The U.S. ruling clique believes this is a panacea for overcoming economic and political difficulties.

　　Some time ago, "Business Week" happily wrote that the arms production program is "the best way to automatically guarantee profitable industries. Military orders will be completed without harming civilian industries. Whenever civilian production is reduced, fortunately, military purchases will compensate for it." However, this expectation of "Business Week" has not proven to be correct. The possibility of a Korean armistice makes industrialists fear that a ceasefire would require further reductions in the extensive and burdensome arms expansion program. According to "The National City Bank of New York" bulletin, just as many industrial sectors have already experienced shutdowns, the suggestion of a Korean ceasefire has intensified the anxiety among entrepreneurs. The government once again considers expanding military orders and strengthening pressure on Congress to grant new military appropriations as its way out.

　　"New York Times" reporter Raskin wrote about the arms expansion program for this fiscal year: government officials "resolutely decided to eliminate the phenomenon of being 30 percent behind in producing weapons for the military and determined to reduce civilian production." In fact, there is no "lag" in the production of weapons, or rather, this "lag" is fabricated by government officials to justify new military orders. Despite the reduction in civilian production, military industries are growing rapidly, bringing huge profits to merchants of death.

　　According to Porter, a financial observer for the "New York Post," the U.S. economy has "transformed from a civilian economy to a semi-militarized economy." According to Truman's recent economic message to Congress, military spending this year is $35 billion (at an annual spending rate), almost double last year's level and 50 percent higher than half a year ago. This cost is expected to increase to more than $50 billion by the end of this year, and to nearly $65 billion by 1952. The portion of the national economy moving onto a war footing has increased from about 6 percent in June last year to nearly 11 percent in June this year. By next year, it will reach 20 percent. According to "Business Week," nearly 11 percent of steel production, 20 percent of copper production, and 30 percent of aluminum production are now directly used for war purposes.

　　"New York Times" reporter Raskin wrote that, in addition to the many military enterprises that entrepreneurs are privately establishing, the government has resumed operating 278 factories established during World War II and is also trying to put 66 factories into operation. Companies such as "General Motors," "Chrysler," and "Ford" may have difficulty producing buses because they can easily accept billions of dollars in orders to manufacture tanks, airplanes, rocket launchers, and other weapons. Military orders for "General Motors" alone have reached nearly $4 billion. "Chrysler" and "Ford" have each received approximately $1 billion in military orders. Raskin pointed out that enterprises in northern New Jersey have accepted $400 million in military orders. He wrote: "This is like injecting a stimulant into companies that produce televisions and radio equipment, textiles, and other items—companies whose production has gradually decreased due to overproduction and weak demand." The profits of some small companies producing daily necessities have decreased slightly, while the profits of large companies have increased more and more, although various industrial sectors have shown a "shrinkage" since this spring. According to "The National City Bank of New York" bulletin, despite the increase in taxes, the total profit of 455 industrial companies in the first half of this year still reached $2,448,645,000, an increase of 3 percent compared with the first half of last year. The profits of companies that manufacture railway equipment (currently mainly producing weapons) increased by 71 percent, and the profits of companies that produce other metal products and oil pipes increased by 43 percent.

　　The report released by the Federal Trade Commission earlier this week clearly shows the prosperity of large companies. The report said that in 1940, the profit from investment in the automobile industry, after deducting all possible expenses and taxes, was 17.3 percent, which increased to 31.7 percent in 1950. During the same period, the profits of chemical companies increased from 14.4 percent to 23.7 percent, the profits of rayon companies increased from 8.6 percent to 17.9 percent, and the profits of oil companies increased from 6.7 percent to 14.3 percent.

　　The decision issued by the Office of Price Stabilization last month to increase the prices of machine tools clearly shows the attitude of the government in dealing with the issue of profits. For many weeks, government officials have been complaining that the production of machine tools is the "weakness" of the arms expansion program, which slows down the production speed of airplanes and other weapons. Despite the demand for machine tools, according to "The Wall Street Journal," machine tool entrepreneurs refused to accept $250 million in orders because the prices set by the government were "too low." Although the 24 large companies producing machine tools and machine equipment reported that their net profit in the second quarter of this year increased by 23 percent compared with the first quarter and 38.5 percent compared with the second quarter of last year, machine tool entrepreneurs were still dissatisfied. When workers in these companies went on strike demanding higher wages, the government accused them of disrupting the "defense program." However, when entrepreneurs "strike," the Office of Price Stabilization does not accuse them and instead issued a decision to increase the price of machine tools, which will be paid by the government but ultimately by the working masses.

　　Some journalists shamelessly admit that election campaigns are an important factor in expanding military production. It was the same "New York Times" reporter Raskin who wrote that the arms expansion program aims to invigorate the economy, and in view of the upcoming elections, the government is trying to avoid "an endless crisis characterized by unemployment and destruction of industrial stability." However, even if new and continuous military orders can temporarily give the economy a new stimulus and increase the Democratic Party's hopes for electoral victory, there are still many things in the economic situation that make the U.S. ruling group uneasy. They ask, what will happen to the U.S. economy two years later, when the military program is completed and armories and military warehouses are filled with weapons? "The Journal of Commerce" expresses full confidence in the near future, but it writes: "Another question is: when the defense effort is completed and we can return to the production of civilian goods, what will we do with our expanded production capacity? ...Regarding this, I think it is really worth worrying about in advance." Cabell, who served as a U.S. Senator for many years and is now the publisher of the widely circulated "Capper's Farmer" magazine for farmers, also expressed anxiety. In the August issue of the magazine, Cabell published an editorial entitled "Is the War Economy So Prevalent That We Fear Peace?" In the article, he expressed concern about the future of an economy dependent on war preparations. Cabell wrote: "I don't like to be in a state of fear and anxiety all the time, but that's exactly what I'm in now. In my opinion, I have enough reason to worry about the future. I find that when we are likely to be involved in a war soon, the stock market prices rise. On the other hand, when there is a possibility of establishing peace, stock market prices fall. Does this mean that our inextricable relationship with the war economy has reached the point of fearing peace? Does this mean that, according to our leaders, we should either have a war economy or an economy based on the terror of the eve of war to maintain our questionable so-called prosperity?"

　　美国独占资本家惧怕朝鲜停战谈判
    力图以加紧备战挽救经济危机
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约十九日讯：美国目前正日益加紧扩充军备运动。最近几周，国防部及其他政府机构都表示要防止军备生产“缩减”，并要求加速扩充军备。“商业周刊”报道说：除去国会现正讨论的各种法案所保证的七百亿美元以外，政府正努力获得追加军事拨款一百五十亿美元。
    用以为扩充军备运动辩解的说法，时常就是什么美国受到严重的威胁，应该防备这种威胁等等。但供给有限读者阅读的资产阶级报纸专号却有比较清醒的论述，那上面说出了造成华盛顿这种战争歇斯底里的较真实的原因。第一、按照目前水平进行的扩充军备计划是不能防止若干日用品工业部门的“萎缩”的。第二、政府害怕把这种情况纠正过来的话，政府在明年的总统选举中就可能处于不利的地位。最严重的是第一个原因。
    尽管为了人工维持美国经济及扩大华尔街利润而支出亿万美元，可是生产过剩的危机仍然威胁着若干工业部门，这些工业部门不得不缩减生产。联邦准备局所发表的工业生产指数由五月的二二三点降到了七月的二一五点，就表现了这种趋向。积压在工业家及商业公司手中的商品总值，由一九五○年六月的五百四十二亿美元增加到一九五一年六月的七百零四亿美元。与存货增加同时，零售贸易减少了。“纽约花旗银行”公报写道：“因为贸易在七月份继续停滞，工业家们就更想采取坚决措施来克服困难，更想限制生产，希望消除存货过多的现象。生产的萎缩已扩大到纺织业、制鞋业和家具业。同时，除五金外，其余所有物品的批发价格均继续下跌。……”《商务日报》也得出了这样的结论，该报指出：“在许多工业部门，为了防止市场上进一步的供过于求的现象，便把能够长久使用的消费品的生产急剧地削减了。”《纽约时报》记者拉斯金连续发表文章论述军事生产计划。他在一篇文章中写道：“使各业厂商及起分配商品作用的公司不安的，现在主要地不是缺乏商品，而是怎样把现有的商品卖出去。对电视机的需求是那样的少，工业家不能把他们的商品销售出去。有许多牌子的汽车都可以以低于官价的价钱买到。几乎所有的工业部门都存在着与此类似的状况。”由于缩减生产的结果，最近失业增加了。八月十六日，劳工部发表的材料说：非农业工人的数目由六月中旬到七月中旬减少了二十万人。在生产消费品特别是在制造无线电收音机、电视机、冷藏器和家用器具的工业中，失业增加了。据现有材料，这种生产“缩减”在八月份仍在继续中。八月十六日美国铁路协会报道：铁路货运在十六日以前的一周中与去年同期相较减少了百分之四点五。据联邦准备局的材料，在八月十一日以前的四周中百货商店的贸易额，与由于朝鲜战争的结果消费者疯狂购买商品的去年同月相较，减少了百分之十一。
    每逢美国经济遇到难关的时候，杜鲁门政府便采取屡经使用的手段——增加军事拨款，美国统治集团认为这是克服经济与政治难关的万灵药。
    若干时间以前，“商业周刊”高兴地写道：军火生产计划是“自动地给工业保证有利可图的最妙的手段。军事订货将在不损害民用工业的程度上来完成。每逢民用品生产削减的时候，所幸都有军事方面的购买来抵补”。可是，“商业周刊”的这个预期并没有证明是正确的。在朝鲜停战的可能性，使工业家们害怕停火会更需要削减广泛的、负担沉重的扩充军备计划。据“纽约花旗银行”公报说，正当许多工业部门已经发生了倒闭现象的时候，关于朝鲜停火的建议使弥漫在企业家中间的忐忑情绪更厉害了。政府再度认为扩大军事订货和加强对国会的压力以使其给予新的军事拨款，是它的出路。
    “纽约时报”记者拉斯金论到本财政年度的扩充军备计划时写道：政府官员“断然决定消灭在为军队生产武器方面落后百分之三十的现象，而确定把民用生产缩减”。实际上，在生产武器方面并没有什么“落后”，或者说，这个“落后”是政府官员为了辩解新的军事订货而捏造出来的。尽管民用品生产缩减，军事工业却在迅速增长，给死亡贩子带来巨大利润。
    据“纽约邮报”的金融观察家波特尔说，美国的经济已经“从民用经济转变为半军事化的经济了”。根据杜鲁门最近致国会的经济咨文，本年军费为三百五十亿美元（按指开支年率），差不多为去年水平的两倍，并比半年以前的水平增加了百分之五十。本年年底这笔费用预料将增加到五百多亿美元，而到一九五二年将增加到差不多六百五十亿元的水平。国民经济中转上战争轨道的部分大约从去年六月的百分之六左右增加到今年六月的将近百分之十一。到明年，将达到百分之二十。根据“商业周刊”的材料：有将近百分之十一的钢产量、百分之二十的铜产量与百分之三十的铝产量现在已直接用于战争的目的。
    “纽约时报”的记者拉斯金写道，除了企业家私人正在建立的许多军事企业外，政府已恢复了在第二次世界大战时期建立的二百七十八家工厂的经营，并且还正在设法使六十六家工厂开工。“通用汽车公司”、“克莱斯勒”与“福特”等公司可能很难出产公共汽车了，因为它们可以毫不困难地接受制造坦克、飞机、火箭炮与其他武器的数十亿美元定货。仅“通用汽车公司”一家的军事定货就差不多达到了四十亿美元。“克莱斯勒”公司与“福特”公司各约得到了十亿美元的军事定货。拉斯金指出，新泽西州北部的企业接受了四亿美元的军事定货。他写道：“这对于出产电视机与无线电器材、纺织品以及其他物品的公司——这些公司的生产由于生产过剩与需求疲弱而逐渐减少——来说，好象是注射了一针刺激剂一样。”一些出产日用品的小公司的利润有些减少，而大公司的利润则越来越多，虽然自今年春季以来，各种工业部门都呈现“缩减”的现象。根据“纽约花旗银行”公报的材料，尽管税收增加了，今年上半年四百五十五家工业公司的总利润仍达二十四亿四千八百六十四万五千美元，比去年上半年增加了百分之三。制造铁路设备的公司（目前主要是生产武器）的利润增加了百分之七十一，出产其他金属品与油管的公司的利润增加了百分之四十三。
    联邦商务委员会本周初发表的报告表明大公司的繁荣。报告说，在一九四○年，汽车工业投资所获利润，扣除一切可能的费用与税收后，为百分之十七点三，在一九五○年增加到百分之三十一点七。在同一时期，化学公司利润从百分之十四点四增加到百分之二十三点七，人造丝公司的利润从百分之八点六增加到百分之十七点九，石油公司的利润从百分之六点七增加到百分之十四点三。
    物价稳定局上月份发表的关于提高工作母机价格的决定，就明白地表现了政府在处理利润问题上抱怎样的态度。许多周以来，政府官员一直抱怨说，工作母机的生产是扩充军备计划的“弱点”，它使飞机与其他武器的生产的速度缓慢下来。尽管有对工作母机的需求，但是据“华尔街日报”写道，工作母机企业家拒绝接受二亿五千万美元的定货，因为政府规定的价格“太低”。虽然出产工作母机与机器设备的二十四家大公司报告在本年第二季度它们获得的纯利比第一季度增加了百分之二十三，比去年第二季度增加了百分之三十八点五，可是，工作母机企业家仍然表示不满。当这些公司所属企业的工人举行罢工要求提高工资时，政府便给他们加上破坏“国防计划”的罪名。可是，当企业家“罢工”时，物价稳定局却不指责他们，而且颁布了关于提高工作母机价格的决定，这笔款将由政府付出，但归根到底还是要由劳动大众付出的。
    一些新闻记者无耻地承认，竞选运动是扩大军事生产的重要因素。还是那位“纽约时报”的记者拉斯金写道，扩充军备计划是旨在活泼经济，鉴于行将来临的选举，政府企图避免“以失业与破坏工业稳定局面为特色的连绵不绝的危机”。然而，即使新的源源不绝的军事定货能够暂时给经济以新的刺激，并增加民主党对选举胜利的希望，可是在经济情势方面还有很多使美国统治集团不安的地方。他们发问道，两年以后，当军事计划完成，军火库和军用仓库充满武器的时候，美国经济会发生怎样的情形呢？“商务日报”对最近将来的前景表示满有信心，但是它写道：“另外一个问题就是：当防御努力完成了，我们又可以回到民用物品生产的时候，我们已扩大了的生产能力将怎样办。……关于这一点，我想倒是真正值得预先忧虑呢。”曾任美国参议员多年，现在是为农场主出版的销路很广的“凯伯尔农场主”杂志的发行人凯伯尔也表示焦虑。凯伯尔在该杂志八月号中发表了一篇以“战争经济是不是已非常普遍，致使我们害怕和平呢？”为题的社论。在该文中，他对取决于战争准备的经济的将来表示忧虑。凯伯尔写道：“我不喜欢老是处在恐惧与不安的状态中，然而我现在却正是陷在这种状态里。在我看来，我有足够的理由为将来担忧。我发现，当我们有可能很快地卷入战争里的时候，交易所的股票行情就上涨了。而另一方面，当有可能建立和平时，股票行情便跌落了。这是不是说，我们同战争经济所结的不解之缘已经达到害怕和平的地步呢？这是不是说，照我们的领导者的意见，我们应该不是拥有战争经济，就是拥有以战争前夕的恐怖为基础的经济，来维持我们成问题的所谓繁荣呢？”
