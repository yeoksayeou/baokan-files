    Shandong Province Rongcheng County People's Court: Correcting the Bad Work Style of Being Detached from the Masses

    To the Editor:
    The Rongcheng County People's Court in Shandong Province has corrected the bureaucratic work style of its cadres being detached from the masses, and the work has made preliminary improvements.
    In the past, the bureaucratic work style of the Rongcheng County People's Court cadres was extremely serious. They regarded people coming to the court to request solutions to problems as troublesome. Some people even mistakenly believed: "There are too many people coming to the court to ask for solutions to problems, if we aren't bureaucratic, we won't be able to finish the work." When the court was busy, many comrades often drove away the masses who came to the court to ask for solutions without asking the reason. When some comrades were in a bad mood, they would not respond even after the masses asked them several times. They adopted an attitude of ignoring letters from the masses urging them to solve problems. The masses were very dissatisfied with the court.
    In May of this year, in order to correct this bad situation, the court leadership, led by Deputy Dean Zhang Yuan, organized all cadres to study. Many comrades examined their thoughts from their work and painfully pointed out that this past work style was a manifestation of the reactionary ruling class's ideology. Leading cadres also reviewed their past bad work style of not paying attention to the opinions of the masses. Everyone pledged to study hard, establish the idea of serving the people, and correct the past bureaucratic attitude. It was also decided to publicize the results of this examination on the blackboard newspaper at the gate of the court, and to set up an opinion box to widely solicit opinions from the masses in order to promote criticism of the court's work by the masses. In addition, some specific measures for handling the opinions of the masses were formulated.
    After this examination, the work style of the court cadres has greatly changed. In handling cases, the investigation and research work has been strengthened. They have also corrected the work style of just staying in the office and have begun to conduct circuit trials in various districts. In May, the court cadres went to various districts to handle 89 cases. The masses' feedback on the court has also improved. Many people said: "Now you don't have to get angry when you go to court!" "The court also sends people here to solve problems for us, and they are afraid that we will delay our work, they really think about us carefully."

    山东省荣城县人民法院  纠正脱离群众的恶劣作风编辑同志：
    山东省荣城县人民法院纠正了该院干部脱离群众的官僚主义作风，工作已经有了初步改进。
    过去荣城县人民法院干部的官僚主义作风是极其严重的。他们把人民来法院要求解决问题看作是麻烦事。有些人甚至错误地认为：“到法院来要求解决问题的人太多，不官僚主义，就干不完。”该院很多同志在工作忙时，就往往不问情由，把来院要求解决问题的群众逼出去。有些同志在自己不高兴时，群众来问事，连问好几声也不答理。他们对于催促解决问题的群众来信，采取置之不理的态度。群众对该院非常不满。
    今年五月，该院领导上为了纠正这种不良情况，就由副院长张远同志领导全体干部进行了学习。很多同志从工作中检查了自己的思想，沉痛地指出过去这种作风是反动统治阶级思想的表现。领导干部也对过去不重视群众意见的不良作风作了检讨。大家保证努力学习，树立为人民服务的思想，纠正过去的官僚主义态度。还决定把这次检查结果在法院门口黑板报上公布，并设立意见箱，广为吸收群众意见，以推动群众对法院工作展开批评。此外，并订出了处理群众意见的一些具体办法。
    经过这次检查后，该院干部工作作风已大有转变。在处理案件中，加强了调查研究工作。他们还纠正了只是呆在机关里的作风，开始到各区作巡回审判。五月份该院干部分头到各区处理了八十九件案件。群众对该院的反映也好了。很多人说：“现在到法院去可不再受气了！”“法院还派人到咱们这里来为我们解决问题，怕我们误工，真为我们想的周到。”
