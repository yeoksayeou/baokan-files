Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 18th: According to TASS, the National Committee of the American Progressive Party is scheduled to hold a meeting in Minneapolis on August 18th and 19th to determine the 1952 election plan. On the eve of the meeting, the party chairman, Benson, urged Truman to accept the Soviet proposal to convene a five-power conference. Benson's statement said: Truman attacked the peddlers of terror and hatred on the 14th. Two weeks ago, he also spoke out against hysteria in Detroit. If Truman truly wants to stop this hysteria, then he should order Ridgway to conclude an armistice agreement on the 38th parallel in Korea, as Acheson and Collins had agreed. It was only recently that Acheson and Collins declared the 38th parallel to be a victory. Now, American children are dying in battle. Why is Ridgway insisting on drawing the line thirty miles north of the 38th parallel, thereby obstructing the armistice negotiations?

Benson said: "As long as Truman allows this meaningless war in Korea to continue, as long as he allows international relations to become increasingly tense - in fact, he is encouraging international relations to become tense - then he will be infected with the plague of McCarthy and McCarran (two reactionary senators in the United States). I can say, and must say, that he will be infected with the plague of peddlers of terror and hatred in his own federal prosecutors' offices. If he truly wants the United States to maintain its basic freedoms, then he should seek peace in Korea, stop the persecution of communists at home that he himself has instigated, and curb the peddlers of terror in his own government, who create new terror with every new military appropriation. If he truly wants to maintain America's freedoms, he should agree to the five-power conference proposed in the letter from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to ease international tensions. With the tense atmosphere of war relieved, Truman can eradicate the intolerable behavior of McCarthy and McCarran, as well as the terrifying remarks of Mr. Truman's own generals and federal prosecutors."

Benson concluded: "The President said in Detroit that actions speak louder than words. So, let us see some actions for peace and freedom, so that you can restrain the peddlers of terror and hatred and keep them in their place."

　　美国进步党主席宾逊
    赞成召开五大国会议
    反对美政府阻碍朝鲜停战谈判
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约十八日讯：美国进步党全国委员会定于八月十八、十九两日在明尼阿波利斯举行会议，以决定一九五二年的竞选计划。该党主席宾逊在会议前夕要求杜鲁门接受苏联提出的关于召开五大国会议的建议。宾逊的声明说：杜鲁门在十四日攻击恐怖贩子和仇恨贩子。两星期以前他在底特律也发言反对歇斯底里。如果杜鲁门真正希望制止这种歇斯底里，那么，他就应该命令李奇微照艾奇逊与柯林斯所曾同意的那样缔结在朝鲜三八线上休战的协定。还只是不久以前，艾奇逊与柯林斯曾宣布三八线即是胜利，现在，美国的孩儿们正在战死，为什么让李奇微坚持要在三八线以北三十英里处划线而阻碍休战谈判呢？
    宾逊说：“只要杜鲁门让这个没有意义的战争在朝鲜继续下去，只要他听任国际关系日趋紧张——事实上他在鼓励国际关系趋于紧张——，则他将传染上麦克锡与麦卡伦（是美国的两个反动参议员）的瘟疫，我可以说，并且要传染上他自己的联邦检察官中的恐怖贩子与仇恨贩子的瘟疫。如果他真正希望美国保持它的基本自由，那他就应该在朝鲜谋取和平，在国内中止他自己指使的迫害共产党的事件，遏制他自己政府中的恐怖贩子们，这些人以每一笔新的军事拨款来制造新的恐怖。如果他真正希望保持美国的各项自由，他就应该同意召开苏联最高苏维埃的信中所建议的五大国会议来缓和国际上的紧张关系。解除了战争的紧张空气，杜鲁门才能根除麦克锡与麦卡伦的令人不能忍受的行为以及杜鲁门先生自己的将军们和联邦检察官们的恐怖言论。”
    宾逊最后说：“总统在底特律说，行动比空谈更有力。那么，让我们看一些争取和平与自由的行动，那样，你才能制止恐怖贩子和仇恨贩子，使之安分守己。”
