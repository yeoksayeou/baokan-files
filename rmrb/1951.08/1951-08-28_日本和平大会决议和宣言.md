　　Resolutions and Declarations of the Japan Peace Conference

　　The conference passed several resolutions and declarations. The "Resolution Requesting the Five Great Powers to Conclude a Peace Pact" stated: "We support the declaration of the First Session of the World Peace Council and request the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Great Britain, and France to conclude a peace pact. To date, approximately 5.2 million Japanese have signed the World Peace Council's declaration. We will increasingly expand this movement."

　　The "Resolution on Concluding an Overall Peace Treaty and Opposing the Rearmament of Japan" stated: "More than 4.6 million Japanese people have expressed their support for concluding an overall peace treaty and opposing the rearmament of Japan. We, representing these millions of people, demand the immediate conclusion of an overall peace treaty in accordance with international agreements. After the conclusion of the treaty, all occupying forces must withdraw from Japan, and no foreign country should station troops or possess military bases in Japan."

　　The conference also passed a resolution on the Japanese peace treaty. The resolution emphasized: "We oppose the American-made draft treaty and the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. We oppose the Yoshida government signing a treaty regardless of the opinions of the Japanese people, and oppose Yoshida as a representative to the San Francisco conference. A separate treaty and military agreement are not in accordance with the spirit of the Potsdam Proclamation, violate the Japanese Constitution and the independence of Japan, and constitute a threat to world peace. We demand that a foreign ministers' conference of the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China be convened to draft the treaty, and that a conference attended by all countries that fought against Japan be convened."

　　"We oppose the rearmament of Japan and demand the conclusion of a fair treaty that ensures Japan's independence."

　　Another resolution requested the Japanese Diet and the Yoshida government to urge the five great powers to conclude a peace pact and to convene a four-country conference on the Japanese peace treaty.

　　The resolution called for measures to be taken to disband the police reserve force, prohibit the development of Japanese war industries, convert Japanese industries to the production of civilian goods, abolish the budget for the rearmament of Japan, take steps to prevent price increases and tax increases, and take measures to pass laws to protect peace, prohibit war propaganda; cooperate with other countries to prohibit the production of atomic bombs, bacteria, chemical, biological, and radioactive weapons, reduce armaments by one-third or one-half, and establish a supervisory system for disarmament; respect Korean independence; restore normal trade relations and exchange cultural achievements; launch a peace movement, and cease actions opposing this movement.

　　The conference passed a decision requesting the heads of government of the five countries to respond to the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, to strive for the conclusion of an overall peace treaty with Japan and not to rearm Japan; to cancel the San Francisco conference aimed at concluding a separate treaty and a U.S.-Japan military agreement, to support the disarmament recommendations passed by the Warsaw Peace Congress, and to strive for the success of the Korean armistice negotiations.

　　The conference passed a letter to the people of Asian countries, which stated: "We Japanese peace fighters congratulate the Asian nations on gaining independence and liberation from imperialist rule, and we believe that this is a great contribution to the cause of world peace. The Japanese people strongly oppose the use of Japanese youth as mercenaries to wage war against the people of Asian countries."

　　The conference also passed a letter to peace-loving people of all countries in the world, which guaranteed to "continue efforts to unite the Japanese people in the struggle to defend peace."

　　The conference passed a letter to the Japanese people, which stated: "We believe that the Japanese people, the first in the world to suffer the devastation of the atomic bomb, should appeal to the world for peace. We call on all Japanese people to sign the declaration requesting the five great powers to conclude a peace pact, and to express the will of the nation by demanding the conclusion of an overall peace treaty and opposing a separate treaty."

　　The conference finally passed a declaration calling for a national peace day to be held on September 1 as a symbol of the Japanese people's protest against the American-made draft treaty with Japan.

    大会通过告日本人民书，其中说：“我们认为，世界上第一个遭到原子弹浩劫的日本人民应该为了和平向世界呼吁。我们号召日本全体人民在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签名，并以要求缔结全面对日和约与反对单独和约来表示民族的意愿。”
    大会最后通过宣言，号召在九月一日举行全国和平日，作为日本人民抗议美制对日和约草案的象征。
