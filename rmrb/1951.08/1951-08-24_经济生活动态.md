　　Economic Life Trends
　　Inviting Farmers to Visit Cities is a Good Way to Educate Farmers
　　The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee invited more than 800 agricultural labor models and farmer representatives from the six provinces of the Central South region to Wuhan to visit the Central South Region's Special Local Products Exhibition and Exchange Conference and some factories. The representatives, totaling 390 people, were sent from Zhengzhou, Huangchuan, Huaiyang, Luoyang, Xinyang, Xuchang, Shanzhou, Chenliu, Shangqiu, and Nanyang Special Districts in Henan, and Xiaogan, Huanggang, Yichang, Jingzhou, Daye, Yunyang, and Xiangyang Special Districts in Hubei. After arriving in Wuhan, they began visiting the Central South Region's Special Local Products Exhibition and Exchange Conference, the Hubei Provincial Agricultural Tool Manufacturing Plant, Wuhan Jiji Hydroelectric Company, Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, and other larger factories from the 6th of this month. This approach helps farmers recognize the greatness of the motherland, strengthens their understanding that the working class is the leading class and that industry leads agriculture, and enables them to recognize the vast prospects of industry, agriculture, and sideline production. At the same time, it also allows for understanding the changes in rural productivity and purchasing power from the farmer representatives, as well as the farmers' demand for industrial products. This is a good way to educate farmers and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance.
　　China-Soviet Civil Aviation Company Launches International Through Transport
　　China-Soviet Civil Aviation Company recently established through transport relations with the Soviet Civil Aviation Administration. From now on, passengers or goods traveling from Beijing to the Soviet Union or various People's Democratic countries in Eastern Europe, after obtaining permission from the relevant departments of the Central People's Government, can complete the procedures at the company to reach or be transported to their destination. The through transport has been implemented since August 20th. This will undoubtedly make transportation between our country and the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries in Eastern Europe more convenient, and further promote the exchange of materials and culture between them.

    邀请农民到城市参观是教育农民的好办法
    中南军政委员会财政经济委员会邀请中南区六省农业劳动模范和农民代表八百多人到武汉市参观中南区土特产展览交流大会和部分工厂。由河南郑州、潢川、淮阳、洛阳、信阳、许昌、陕州、陈留、商邱、南阳各专区和湖北孝感、黄冈、宜昌、荆州、大冶、郧阳、襄阳各专区派出的代表三百九十人，到达武汉市后，从本月六日起开始参观中南区土特产展览交流大会和湖北省农具制造厂、武汉市既济水电公司、武汉市第一纱厂等较大的工厂。这样做可以帮助农民认识祖国的伟大，加强农民对工人阶级是领导阶级和工业领导农业的认识，使农民认识工农业和副业生产的广大前途。同时，也可以从农民代表了解农村生产力和购买力变化的情况，了解农民对工业品的需求。这是教育农民和加强工农联盟的一个好办法。
  中苏民用航空公司举办国际联运
    中苏民用航空公司最近与苏联民用航空局建立了联运关系。今后由北京到苏联或东欧各人民民主国家的乘客或货物，经中央人民政府有关部门许可后，到该公司办理手续即可到达或运到目的地。联运已自八月二十日起开始实行。这无疑地将使我国和苏联及东欧各人民民主国家之间的交通更加便利，更能促进相互间的物资交流和文化交流。
