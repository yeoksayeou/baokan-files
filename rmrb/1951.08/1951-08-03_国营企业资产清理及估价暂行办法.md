　　Provisional Measures for State-Owned Enterprise Asset Inventory and Valuation

　　Article 1: In accordance with the "Decision on Inventorying Assets and Verifying Funds of State-Owned Enterprises," these measures are formulated to effectively grasp the asset situation of state-owned enterprises, so as to correctly calculate and verify the fixed assets and working capital of enterprises.

　　Article 2: All national state-owned enterprises shall, in accordance with the provisions of these measures, conduct a comprehensive inventory of all existing assets as of the end of June 1951; and revalue them, using Renminbi as the calculation standard.

　　I. State-owned enterprises whose total asset quantities are accurate and clear shall conduct a review. If the asset quantities are still inaccurate, a new inventory and arrangement shall be carried out.

　　II. State-owned enterprises whose original book value and valuation standards of assets are consistent with the principles stipulated in these measures shall conduct a review. If the original book value and valuation standards of assets are largely or partially inconsistent with the principles stipulated in these measures, all or part of the assets shall be revalued immediately.

　　Article 3: The existing assets mentioned in the preceding article include the on-book assets and all off-book assets of the enterprise units, but the following two types of assets shall be handled separately:

　　I. According to the regulations of the National Warehouse Material Inventory and Allocation Committee, materials under the custody of the warehouse of the General Administration of Materials Management of the Central Ministry of Finance shall not be inventoried by the enterprise units. However, the inventory materials that have been determined to be turned over to the central government but are still under the custody of the enterprise unit’s warehouse shall still be inventoried by the enterprise unit. Except for the materials that the Planning Bureau of this committee has determined must be retained, the remaining custodial materials shall be separately formulated into sales plans and payments shall be made to the Ministry of Finance in installments. For those that have been used and sold, the funds shall be immediately remitted to the Central Ministry of Finance.

　　II. The capital construction projects and equipment for the year 1951 (including unfinished projects in 1950, which have been approved as additional capital construction projects in 1951) shall be strictly distinguished from the existing working capital and fixed assets of the enterprise, and shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work Procedures" and shall not be inventoried or valued. Completed projects in 1950, regardless of whether a final account has been prepared, shall be revalued and included in the assets.

　　Article 4: The standards and scope for the division of fixed assets and working capital of national state-owned enterprises are determined according to the following principles:

　　I. Those belonging to fixed assets include:

　　Including production houses, buildings, power equipment, transmission equipment, production machinery and equipment, tools and appliances used in production, transportation vehicles, furniture and supplies, reserve fixed assets, investment in land, fixed assets for agricultural and sideline production, fixed assets for sales and supply, residential buildings and ancillary buildings, cultural and life facilities and health care fixed assets, etc. (See annex for details)

　　II. Those belonging to working capital include:

　　Including raw materials and main materials, purchased semi-finished products, auxiliary materials, fuel, work-in-progress, finished products, spare parts for miscellaneous repairs, packaging materials, low-value and consumable items, prepayments, accounts receivable, cash on hand, etc.

　　III. Under any of the following circumstances, it shall be included in working capital:

　　(1) Assets with a service life of less than one year and fragile items (such as glassware, etc.), regardless of value, shall be included in working capital.

　　(2) Items with a service life of more than one year and a unit value of less than RMB 1 million shall be included in working capital. This type of item shall be amortized into costs in installments according to its service life, and replacement shall be carried out from the amortization. (The central competent departments may, within the prescribed limit, formulate the division limit standards for each department in combination with the specific conditions of the enterprise, and attach the variety, unit and value data of low-value products, and submit them to the National Asset Verification Committee for record.)

　　Article 5: The valuation of fixed assets of national state-owned enterprises shall be based on the "replacement complete value" at the end of June 1951. The so-called replacement complete value refers to the replacement cost of obtaining the asset in a brand-new state under the current conditions, including invoice price, taxes, commissions, and transportation and miscellaneous expenses.

　　I. If it is a fixed asset of construction, the construction cost under the current conditions shall be its replacement cost; including design fees, construction preparation work fees (construction costs of temporary workshops, warehouses, railway special lines, etc., minus the proceeds from the sale of the materials after completion), the value of the entire construction project, the purchase of equipment and the expenses for repairing individual defects after the completion of the project.

　　II. If it is a fixed asset of machine installation, the installation cost under the current conditions shall be its replacement cost; including invoice price, taxes, commissions, inspection fees, transportation fees and installation fees.

　　III. Various major repair expenses of fixed assets shall be offset by the major repair depreciation fund, and shall not be calculated as an increase in the book value of fixed assets.

　　IV. Worn-out and damaged fixed assets that have become invalid shall be valued at the estimated possible selling price.

　　Article 6: In order to correctly calculate the value and depreciation of fixed assets and establish and implement the responsibility system, the enterprise unit shall mainly re-identify the service life based on the degree of newness, capacity and use of the fixed assets (if calculated by ton-kilometer, the service ton-kilometer should be identified).

　　I. Identify the actual remaining service life and determine its total durable life based on its unworn actual degree, that is, the actual percentage of undepreciated value. The total durable life minus the remaining service life is the used life.

　　II. For the identification of the service life of machines, for continuous operations such as smelting, mining, power generation, and machinery such as textiles, papermaking, and rubber, 24 hours of work per day and night shall prevail, and 16 hours shall prevail for tool machines (mother machines). The number of working hours per day and night for machinery in other enterprise departments shall be uniformly stipulated by the central competent department and submitted to the National Asset Verification Committee for record.

　　Article 7: Fixed assets that have suffered major damage due to war or other special reasons, but are still usable in production, may be temporarily valued at the residual value after deducting the amount of damage from the replacement complete value before the government appropriates funds for repairs. The so-called amount of damage refers to the total value of the damaged part (non-worn depreciation part); when calculating, the total damage rate (the sum of each percentage) should be obtained first according to the degree of damage (percentage) of each component of the asset, and then multiplied by the replacement safety value to obtain it.

　　Article 8: Valuation of land:

　　I. For land such as mines, forests, ponds, oil fields, salt fields, farmland, pastures, railways, and highways of state-owned enterprises, unless otherwise stipulated by special operating enterprises, if they were originally purchased after the government took over or have gone through financial procedures as investors, the actual investment amount or the original book amount shall be the land value. The rest will not be valued for the time being, and its ground works shall be valued and included in the construction assets.

　　II. For the base of houses and its affiliated land, if it was originally purchased after the government took over or its original value has been listed in the account, the original book amount shall be the land value; for those that have not been valued, the valuation shall be carried out uniformly; the valuation standard shall be the land price estimated by the local land administration agency (if there is no land administration agency, the local people's government).

　　III. Land is not amortized for depreciation, but the enterprise unit shall make a separate record of the quantity and use of all land for future reference and submit it in a list.

　　Article 9: For fixed assets such as houses, land, and constructions whose property rights have not been determined, the relevant enterprise units shall quickly consult with the people's governments at all levels to resolve them, and the enterprise that obtains the property rights shall conduct valuation to determine the funds. If the property rights are difficult to determine before the asset inventory and valuation, the user unit shall temporarily value them and list them as custodial assets with undetermined property rights, and then formally handle them after the property rights are determined.

　　Article 10: The valuation of working capital of national state-owned enterprises shall also be based on the replacement cost at the end of June 1951, that is, including current price, taxes, commissions, and purchase transportation and miscellaneous expenses. The valuation principles are as follows:

　　I. Raw materials, materials, auxiliary materials, fuel, etc., shall be valued at replacement cost.

　　II. Self-made products shall be valued at actual cost. Purchased commodities and semi-finished products shall be valued at replacement cost.

　　III. Work-in-progress shall be valued at actual cost, or at the proportion of work-in-progress to product cost.

　　IV. Accounts receivable, advance payments, etc. shall be listed according to the balance listed in the account.

　　V. Waste products and waste materials shall be valued at the estimated possible selling price.

　　Article 11: Public bonds, securities, etc., with market prices shall be listed at market prices. Those without market prices shall be valued according to the actual situation. Real discount public bonds shall be listed at the listed price.

　　Article 12: In the asset valuation work of national state-owned enterprises, regarding the price standards at the end of June for fixed assets and working capital, except for self-made products and work-in-progress that are valued at actual cost, each competent department shall, based on the actual situation, combine the following methods to organize technical, financial, experts and knowledgeable personnel to jointly and properly evaluate:

　　I. Public price, listed price, trade contract price or domestic and foreign market information;

　　II. Selling price or construction cost of state-owned and public enterprises;

　　III. Market price of the local or nearby area;

　　IV. The ratio price of the same type of asset according to different specifications or brands;

　　V. Valued according to the original book value of the asset converted by the price index.

　　Article 13: Each department shall formulate unified price standards for major machinery and equipment and submit them to the National Asset Verification Committee for record. For the valuation of other fixed and working capital, the price standards of enterprises across the country shall be reviewed to avoid being too high or too low.

　　Article 14: National state-owned enterprises shall also sort out various liabilities as of the end of June 1951 and report them together.

　　Article 15: After the assets of each enterprise are revalued, if the revaluation and the original book amount have a cost difference or a premium difference, they shall be listed in the asset account and the depreciation reserve and the asset inventory and valuation difference account respectively for adjustment. After final approval, they shall be transferred to government funds.

　　Article 16: National state-owned enterprises shall compile a list of all assets and liabilities in accordance with the prescribed reports and based on the actual figures at the end of June 1951. The warehouse director, chief accountant, and department heads of each enterprise unit shall be responsible for signing, and then the asset verification committees at all levels shall review and compile them level by level, and be responsible for signing before reporting to the National Asset Verification Committee.

　　Article 17: The central competent departments and the asset verification committees of the major administrative regions may, in accordance with the provisions of these measures, combine the actual situation of their affiliated enterprises to uniformly formulate specific supplementary implementation measures and submit them to the National Asset Verification Committee for record.

　　Article 18: These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

    第一条根据《关于国营企业清理资产核定资金的决定》，为切实掌握国营企业的资产情况，以便正确计算并核定企业的固定资金与流动资金，特制定本办法。
    第二条  全国国营企业，应一律依照本办法的规定，对截至一九五一年六月底的实有资产，全部进行清理；并概以人民币为计算本位，重行估价。
    一、各国营企业，其全部资产数量确已正确清楚者，进行复核。如其资产数量仍不正确者，则重行清点整理。
    二、各国营企业，其资产原帐面价值和估价标准，确与本办法的规定原则相符者，进行复核。其资产原帐面价值和估价标准，如大部或一部与本办法的规定原则不符者，则其资产的全部或一部，应即重行估价。
    第三条  前条所称的实有资产，包括企业单位的帐面资产和所有帐外资产，但下列两项资产，应分别处理：
    一、按全国仓库物资清理调配委员会规定，属于中央财政部物资管理总局仓库保管的物资，企业单位不作清理，但已确定上缴中央现仍由企业单位仓库负责代管的清仓物资，企业单位仍应予以清理，除本委计划局确定必须保留的物资外，其余代管物资，应分别订出销售计划，分期向财政部交款，其已使用及出卖者，应即将款项解缴中央财政部。
    二、属于一九五一年度的基本建设工程与器材（包括一九五○年未完工程，经批准列作一九五一年追加基本建设工程），应与企业现有的流动资产和固定资产严格划分，按照《基本建设工作程序暂行办法》的规定办理，不予清理估价，属于一九五○年已完工程，不论是否编造决算，应一律重行估价，列入资产。
    第四条  全国国营企业固定资产与流动资产划分的标准和范围，确定原则如下：
    一、属于固定资产者：
    包括生产用房屋、建筑物、动力设备，传导设备、生产机器设备、工具和生产上应用的器具、运输工具、家具用品、预备固定资产，对土地的投资，农产和副业用固定资产销货和供应用固定资产，住宅和附属建筑物，文化生活设施用和卫生保健用固定资产等项。（详见附件）
    二、属于流动资产者：
    包括原料和主要材料、购入半成品、辅助材料、燃料、在制品、成品、零星修理用的备品、包装器材、低值和易耗品、预付款、应收帐款、库存现金等项。
    三、凡具有下列情形者，应列入流动资产：
    （１）资产的效用期间在一年以下者和易碎物品（如玻璃器具等），不论价值多寡，一律列入流动资产。
    （２）物品的效用期间在一年以上，单位价值在人民币一百万元以下者，应列入流动资产。此种物品按其使用期限，分期摊入成本，从摊提中进行重置。（中央各主管部可在此规定限额内，结合企业具体情况，拟定各该部划分限额标准，并附列为低值品的品种，单位和价值资料，报送全国核资委员会备案。）
    第五条  全国国营企业，固定资产的估价，应以一九五一年六月底的“重置完全价值”为标准。所称重置完全价值，系指按在目前条件下，获得该项资产崭新状态的重置成本，包括发票正价、税捐、佣金及运杂费等。
    一、如为建筑的固定资产，则以其在目前条件下的建筑费为其重置成本；包括设计费用、建筑准备工作费用（临时工舍、仓库、铁道专用线等的建造费用，减去完工后变卖该项物资所得的款项）、全部建筑工程价值、购置设备和工程完成后对个别缺点修整等支出。
    二、如为机器按装的固定资产，则以其在目前条件下的设置费为其重置成本；包括发票正价、税捐、佣金、检验费、运输费和按装费等。
    三、固定资产的各项大修费用，由大修理折旧款项抵补，不得作为增加固定资产的帐面价值计算。
    四、用坏和损坏已失效用的固定资产，按估计可能出售的价格估列。
    第六条  为正确计算固定资产的价值和折旧，并建立与贯彻责任制；企业单位主要应根据固定资产的新旧程度、能力和使用情况等，重新鉴定使用年限（如按吨公里计算者，应鉴定使用吨公里）。
    一、鉴定确实尚可使用年限，并根据其未磨损实际程度，即未折旧实际成数（百分比），确定其全部耐用年限，全部耐用年限减去尚可使用年限即为已使用年限。
    二、对机器使用年限的鉴定，在冶炼、矿山、发电等连续性作业的机械和纺织、造纸、橡胶等机械，以一昼夜工作二十四小时为准，工具机械（母机）则以十六小时为准。其他各企业部门的机械，一昼夜以若干工作小时为准，由中央主管部统一规定，报送全国核资委员会备案。
    第七条  因战争或其他特殊原因遭受重大破坏，但在生产上仍可使用的固定资产，在未经政府拨款修复以前，可暂按重置完全价值减除破损额后的余值估价。所称破损额，系指破损部分（非磨损的折旧部分）的总价值；计算时，应先按资产各组成部分的破损程度（百分比）求得总破损率（各百分比之和），然后乘重置安全价值即得。
    第八条  土地的估价：
    一、国营企业的矿山、森林、池塘、油田、盐田、农田、牧场、铁路、公路等土地除特殊经营的企业另作规定者外，如原系人民政府接管后投资购入或已经办理财务手续作为投资者，则按实际投资额或原帐面额为土地价值。其余暂不估价，其地面工程应估价列入营造物资产内。
    二、房屋基地及其附属土地，如原系人民政府接管后投资购入或其原已估价列帐者，即以原帐面额为土地价值；其未估价者，应一律进行估价；估价标准以当地地政机关（如无地政机关以当地人民政府）所估定的地价为标准。
    三、土地不摊提折旧，但企业单位应将所有全部土地的数量及其使用情况，另作记录备查，并列册上报。
    第九条  房屋土地营造物等固定资产，其产权有未确定者，应迅速由有关企业单位并与各级人民政府会商解决，由获得产权之企业进行估价以便确定资金。如产权在清产估价前实难确定者，由使用单位暂行估价，列为产权未定的代管资产，俟产权确定后再作正式处理。
    第十条  全国国营企业，流动资产的估价，亦应以一九五一年六月底的重置成本为标准，即包括现价、税捐、佣金及采购运杂费等。估价原则如下：
    一、原料、材料、辅助材料、燃料等，按重置成本估价。
    二、自制产品，按实际成本估价。购入商品和半成品，按重置成本估价。
    三、在制品按实际成本，或按在制品占产品成本比例估价。
    四、应收帐款、预付款项等，按帐列结余额计列。
    五、废品、废料，按估计可能出售的价格估价。
    第十一条  公债、有价证券等，有时价者，按时价估列。无时价者，按实际情形酌量估价。折实公债，按牌价估列。
    第十二条  全国国营企业，在资产估价工作中，关于固定资产和流动资产的六月底价格标准，除自制产品和在制品按实际成本估列者外，由各主管部根据实际情况，结合下列办法，组织技术、财务、专家和了解情况之人员，共同妥善评定：
    一、公价、牌价、贸易合同价或国内外行情资料；
    二、国公营企业的售价或造价；
    三、当地或临近地区的市价；
    四、根据规格或牌号不同的同种资产的比价；
    五、按资产原帐面价值，以物价指数换算估列。
    第十三条  各部门应将主要机器设备，订出统一价格标准，报送全国核资委员会备案。对其他固定及流动资产的估价，应将全国各地企业的价格标准进行审定，以免偏高偏低。
    第十四条  全国国营企业，对截至一九五一年六月底的各项负债，亦应分别整理，一并上报。
    第十五条  各企业资产经重估价后，如重估价与原帐面额发生耗价或溢价差额时，应分别列入资产帐户与折旧准备及清产估价差额科目，予以调整。经最后核准后，结转政府资金。
    第十六条  全国国营企业，应将全部资产与负债，按照规定表报，根据一九五一年六月底的实有数字编造清册，先由各该企业单位的仓库主任、会计主任、部门首长负责签字，再由各级主管核资委员会逐级审核汇编，并负责签字后，层报全国核资委员会。
    第十七条  各中央主管部及大行政区核资委员会，得根据本办法的规定，结合所属企业的实际情况，统一拟定具体实施补充办法，报送全国核资委员会备案。
    第十八条  本办法自颁布之日施行。
