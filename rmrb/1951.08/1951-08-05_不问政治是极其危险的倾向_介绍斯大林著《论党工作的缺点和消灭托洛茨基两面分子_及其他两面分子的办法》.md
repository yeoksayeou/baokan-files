　　Not Paying Attention to Politics Is an Extremely Dangerous Tendency
    —Introducing Stalin’s “On the Deficiencies in Party Work and Measures for Liquidating the Trotskyite and Other Double-Dealers”

    The People’s Publishing House has recently published a classic work – Stalin’s report and concluding remarks at the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) held in March 1937: “On the Deficiencies in Party Work and Measures for Liquidating the Trotskyite and Other Double-Dealers.” This report marked the stage of the Soviet Union's exterminatory struggle against Trotskyites and other double-dealers. The Soviet Union, since the October Revolution, had waged a cruel struggle against hidden foreign spies and domestic traitors, lasting for twenty years. It was not until 1937 that this struggle achieved a complete victory. Obviously, without such a long-term struggle, there would have been no consolidated socialist economic construction and national defense, and no victory in the anti-fascist war. In this report, Stalin emphasized the importance of strengthening the political vigilance of the entire Communist Party, and it was the implementation of this instruction that guaranteed and consolidated the victory in the struggle against hidden enemies.

    Stalin first analyzed the characteristics of the struggle in 1937. In particular, he analyzed the way Trotskyites and other double-dealers carried out sabotage at that time. Stalin warned everyone: do not forget the "very important fact" that the Soviet Union was under capitalist encirclement. “Capitalist encirclement means that there is one country, the Soviet Union, which has established a socialist system within its borders; in addition, there are many countries, namely bourgeois countries, which continue to live in a capitalist way and surround the Soviet Union, waiting for an opportunity to attack it, crush it, or at least damage its power and weaken it.” He also pointed out the historical facts that capitalist countries also engaged in various espionage and military sabotage against each other, and then asked: "Why should the attitude of bourgeois countries towards the Soviet socialist country be more moderate and friendly than their attitude towards their bourgeois counterparts? Why should these countries send fewer spies, assassins, military saboteurs, and murderers to the Soviet Union's rear than they send to the rear of their bourgeois counterparts? Where did you get this view from? From a Marxist point of view, isn't it more correct to assume that bourgeois countries send twice or even three times as many assassins, spies, military saboteurs, and murderers to the Soviet Union's rear as they send to the rear of any bourgeois country?”

    Stalin pointed out: After a long struggle with Trotskyism, "Trotskyism and Trotskyites have undergone major changes during this period, and this evolution has fundamentally changed the face of Trotskyism." Stalin said: The Trotskyism of the past was a reactionary political faction that attempted to influence the working masses with its reactionary program; the Trotskyites of today are no longer a political faction, because their program has completely bankrupted. The work of Trotskyites has completely become the work of spies and assassins employed by imperialism. Therefore, the working method of the Trotskyite gang is not to openly publicize their views, but on the contrary, to obliterate their views, "to bow down and flatteringly praise the views of their enemies, and to ruin their own views with hypocrisy and affectation." Stalin severely criticized the tendency to lose vigilance against such disguised saboteurs.

    Stalin said: Why have many comrades forgotten the main facts mentioned above regarding the domestic and international situation? Why are they so bad at detecting sabotage and military destruction? Why are they so careless, amicable, and naive that they often help foreign spies seize certain important positions themselves? Stalin believed that the problem lies in "victory, like everything else in the world, has its dark side."

    “The problem is that our party comrades in recent years have completely devoted themselves to economic work, they are extremely intoxicated with economic victories, and precisely because they are intoxicated with all this, they have forgotten everything else, and they have abandoned everything else.”

    “The problem is that precisely because they are intoxicated with economic victories, they think that economic work includes everything. And they simply do not pay attention to such things as the Soviet Union's international environment, capitalist encirclement, strengthening the party's political work, fighting against sabotage, etc., considering all these things to be of secondary importance or even tertiary importance."

    “...The danger arising from victory, the danger arising from achievements. Yes, yes, comrades, it is the danger arising from victory, from achievements. This danger lies in the fact that people with little political experience and not much insight, when they encounter such a victorious environment of successive victories, step-by-step success, and repeated over-fulfillment of plans, develop a sense of indifference and complacency, this victorious environment creates an atmosphere of boasting about victories and congratulating each other, and boasting about victories and congratulating each other hurts the sense of right and wrong and paralyzes political sensitivity, this victorious environment makes people relax and prompts them to rest easy."

    In order to eliminate these shortcomings in work, Stalin said:

    "First of all, we must shift the attention of our party comrades in this or that organ who are entangled in 'routine affairs' to the major political issues at home and abroad."

    "We must raise our party's political work to the proper level, and make the political education and Bolshevik training of party, Soviet, and economic work cadres as the primary task."

    "We must explain to our party comrades that the significance of economic victory is undoubtedly extremely great, and we will continue to seek this victory day by day and year by year in the future, but economic victory cannot include all the undertakings of our socialist construction without omission."

    "It must be explained that economic victory itself, and its consolidation and durability, completely depend on the victory of the party's organizational work and the party's political work; without this condition, economic victory will be something built on sand."

    Stalin said: "To carry out sabotage and assassination, you don't need a large number of people. To build the Dnieper project, you need tens of thousands of workers. But to blow up this project, maybe at most a few dozen people are needed. To win a war, you may need several army corps of Red Army soldiers. But to sabotage this victory on the front line, it only takes a few spies in a certain military department, or even in a certain division department, who can steal the combat plan and hand it over to the enemy army. To build a large railway bridge, you need thousands of people. But to blow up this bridge, you only need a few people." Such is the danger of not paying attention to politics and losing political vigilance.

    See how Stalin emphasized the importance of cadres' ability to distinguish directions politically: "I think that if we can, if we are good at training our party cadres ideologically from the bottom up and politically tempering them, so that they can freely identify directions in the domestic and international environment, if we are good at creating them into fully mature Leninists and Marxists, so that they can solve the problem of national leadership without making serious mistakes, then we will solve nine-tenths of all our tasks."

    Although the scope of the Chinese people's democratic united front is broad, and the revolutionary unity of the various democratic classes is consolidated, there is also a small number of extremely reactionary elements who are unwilling to lose their power to oppress the people and are carrying out crazy destruction of the new China. At the same time, most of the newly joined cadres still lack the necessary political experience, and some old cadres, in the environment of victory, are gradually breeding the numb thought of not paying attention to politics, which gives the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of. The tragic events caused by this are not few. Therefore, Stalin's criticism of neglecting cadres' political education and neglecting political vigilance is worthy of our warning. At the same time, as Stalin said, raising the Marxist-Leninist political level of cadres is not only the key to solving the problem of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, but also the key to solving "all tasks." From this, it can be seen how serious a dangerous tendency it is to not pay attention to politics.

　　不问政治是极其危险的倾向
    ——介绍斯大林著《论党工作的缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子
    及其他两面分子的办法》
    长冬
    人民出版社最近出版了一本经典著作——斯大林在一九三七年三月举行的联共（布）中央委员会全会上的报告和结束语：《论党工作的缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法》。这个报告，标志了苏联对托洛茨基等两面分子斗争的消灭性的阶段。苏联自十月革命后，和暗藏的外国间谍及本国叛徒所进行的残酷斗争，历时达二十年。至一九三七年，这个斗争才取得了彻底的胜利。显然地，如果不曾进行这样的长期斗争，就不会有巩固的社会主义经济建设和国防建设，就不会有反法西斯战争的胜利。斯大林在这个报告中，强调指出加强联共全党的政治警觉性的重要，正是这一指示的贯彻执行，才保证了和巩固了对暗藏的敌人的斗争的胜利。
    斯大林首先分析了一九三七年这一时期的斗争特点。特别是他分析了当时托洛茨基等两面分子进行破坏的方式。斯大林警告大家：不要忘记苏联是处在资本主义包围下的这个“很重要的事实”。“资本主义的包围——这就是说，有一个国家，即苏联，在自己境内建立了社会主义制度；此外还有许多国家，即资产阶级国家，继续着资本主义的生活方式，并包围着苏联，正在等待时机，以便进攻它，粉碎它，或者至少要毁损它的威力并削弱它。”他又指出了就是资本主义国家相互之间，也进行着种种间谍和军事破坏的历史事实，然后反问道：“为什么资产阶级国家对苏维埃社会主义国家的态度应当比它们对自己同类的资产阶级国家的态度更为温和与更为友好呢？为什么这些国家派遣到苏联后方来的间谍、暗害者、军事破坏者和杀人凶手应当比它们派遣到自己同类的资产阶级国家后方去的少些呢？你们这个看法是从什么地方得来的呢？设想资产阶级国家所派遣到苏联后方来的暗害者、间谍、军事破坏者和杀人凶手比它们派遣到任何一个资产阶级国家后方去的应当多两倍甚至三倍，这从马克思主义观点看来不是更正确些吗？”
    斯大林指出：经过了和托洛茨基主义的长期斗争之后，“托洛茨基主义和托洛茨基分子在这一时期中有了重大的演变，这个演变根本改变了托洛茨基主义的面貌”。斯大林说：过去的托洛茨基主义是一个反动的政派，它企图用自己反动的纲领来影响工人群众；现在的托洛茨基分子则已经不是什么政派，因为它的政纲已经根本破产了。托洛茨基分子的工作，完全变成帝国主义雇用的间谍和暗杀犯的工作。因此，托洛茨基匪帮的工作方式，就不是公开宣传自己的观点，相反，是抹杀自己的观点，“卑躬屈膝和阿谀逢迎地颂扬自己敌人的观点，用假仁假义和装腔作势的手法来糟蹋他们自己的观点。”斯大林严厉批评了对于这种伪装的暗害分子失掉警觉的倾向。
    斯大林说：为什么许多同志忘记了上述国内外状况方面的主要事实呢？为什么如此不善于察觉暗害与军事破坏的行为呢？为什么如此漫不经心、一团和气、天真幼稚，至于往往自己帮助了外国奸细窃占某些重要职位呢？斯大林认为：这问题就在于“胜利也和世界上一切事物一样有其阴暗的方面”。
    “问题是在于：我们党的同志在最近几年来完全埋头于经济工作，他们极端迷醉于经济上的胜利，而且正因为迷醉于这全部事情，就忘记了其他的一切事情，就抛弃了其他的一切事情。”
    “问题是在于：正因为他们迷醉于经济上的胜利，就以为经济工作包括一切。而对于这样的事情，如苏联的国际环境，资本主义的包围，加强党的政治工作，与暗害勾当作斗争等等，就简直不加以注意，认为这一切都是次等重要或甚至三等重要的事情。”
    “……因胜利而发生的危险，因成绩而发生的危险。是的，是的，同志们，是因胜利、因成绩而发生的危险。这种危险是在于：政治经验很少和见识不很多的人们，一遇到节节胜利、步步成功、一再超过完成计划的这种胜利环境，便产生漫不关心和自满自足的情绪，这种胜利环境便造成炫耀胜利和相互恭贺的气氛，而炫耀胜利与互相恭贺就伤害是非之感和麻痹政治嗅觉，这种胜利环境使人们松懈起来，并促使他们高枕无忧。”
    为了消灭这种工作中的缺点，斯大林说：
    “首先必须把这个或那个机关中纠缠于‘日常事务’的我们党的同志的注意力转到国际和国内的大的政治问题上去。”
    “必须把我们党的政治工作提到应有的高度，把党的、苏维埃的和经济工作的干部的政治教育和布尔什维克锻炼作为首要的任务。”
    “必须向我们党的同志说明：经济胜利的意义不容争辩地是极其伟大的，我们今后仍将日复一日、年复一年地来求得这种胜利，然而经济胜利却不能把我们社会主义建设的全部事业包括无遗。”
    “必须说明：经济胜利本身及其巩固性和持久性，完完全全依靠于党的组织工作和党的政治工作的胜利；如果没有这个条件，经济胜利就会是建筑在沙岸上的东西。”
    斯大林说：“要实行捣乱和暗害，并不需要大批的人。要建筑德涅泊尔工程，就需要成万的工人。但要炸毁这一工程，也许至多需要几十个人。要在战争期间打胜仗，可能需要几个兵团的红军战士。但要在前线上破坏这一胜利，却只要在某个军部、甚至只要在某个师部内有几个能偷出作战计划来交给敌军的间谍就够了。要建筑一座大的铁路桥梁，就需要几千人。但要炸毁这座桥梁，却只需要几个人就够了。”不问政治、失掉政治上的警惕的危险性就是如此。
    请看斯大林是何等强调干部在政治上辨别方向的能力的重要：“我以为：如果我们能够、如果我们善于把我们党的干部自下而上地在思想上加以训练并且在政治上加以锻炼，使得他们能够在国内外环境中自由地识别方向，如果我们善于把他们造成完全成熟的列宁主义者、马克思主义者，使他们能够解决国家领导问题而不犯严重错误，那末我们便把我们的一切任务解决十分之九了。”
    虽然中国人民民主主义的统一战线范围是广大的，各民主阶级的革命的团结是巩固的。但也有一小部分极端反动的分子，不甘心于失掉他们压迫人民的权势，对新中国进行着疯狂的破坏。同时，多数新参加工作的干部还缺少必要的政治经验，一部分老干部在胜利的环境中，也逐渐滋生着不问政治的麻木思想，这就给予敌人以可乘之隙。由此而引致的惨痛事件是不少的。因此，斯大林对于忽视干部政治教育、忽视政治上的警惕的批评，是值得我们警诫的。同时，如斯大林所说，提高干部的马克思、列宁主义的政治水平，并不止是解决镇压反革命问题的关键，而且是解决“一切任务”的关键。由此可见：不问政治是多么严重的危险倾向。
