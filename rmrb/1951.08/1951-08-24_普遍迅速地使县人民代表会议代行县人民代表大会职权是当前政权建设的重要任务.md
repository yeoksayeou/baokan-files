Universally and Rapidly Enabling County People's Representative Meetings to Exercise the Functions and Powers of County People's Congresses is an Important Task in Current Regime Construction
(Li Youyi, Teaching Assistant, Department of Law, Peking University)
(I)
　　On April 24th of this year, the Government Administration Council, in its "Instructions on the Work of Building the People's Democratic Regime," proposed: "People's representative meetings at the county and city levels that have not yet exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress should actively create conditions to quickly exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress." On May 11th, Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Government Administration Council, in his report on "The Situation and Current Tasks of Political and Legal Work," also proposed: "Except for governments below the county level in areas where land reform has not yet been carried out and those with other special circumstances, conditions should be created as soon as possible so that people's representative meetings can exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress within this year." It can be seen that universally and rapidly enabling county people's representative meetings to exercise the functions and powers of county people's congresses has already become an urgent and important task for the current national regime construction, especially in the North China region.
　　The presentation of this serious political task is based entirely on the objective situation and fully conforms to the requirements of the objective situation. This objective situation is: At present, the country is facing the preparatory work for large-scale economic construction, which requires a strong regime to lead and guarantee it; especially after the education of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the awareness and organization of the broad masses of people have been unprecedentedly improved, requiring the strengthening of democratic political life, and requiring the people's representative meetings, as an organizational form for exercising their own state power, to be more widely and closely connected with the masses of the people in terms of organizational foundation, and to gradually make it complete in organizational form, that is to say, requiring the people's representative meetings to quickly exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress.
　　However, in reality, our work in building the people's democratic regime lags behind the development of the objective situation. Judging solely from the situation of exercising powers, according to statistics in March of this year, among the 1,961 counties nationwide that had held people's representative meetings, only 90 counties had already exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress (another 23 counties had held People's Congresses); according to recent statistics, among the 331 counties in North China, only 20 counties had already exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress or convened a People's Congress.
(II)
　　For county people's representative meetings to universally and rapidly exercise the functions and powers of county people's congresses, judging from the general situation in various parts of North China and the experience of several counties, the basic problem is not a matter of conditions, but a matter of the ideological understanding of the cadres. If ideological problems are not resolved, people will not actively create conditions and strive to quickly exercise their powers; even if they do exercise them, it will only be a formality and not a reality.
　　The situation we saw in Chahar this time was like this.
　　Yanggao County proposed "convening a county-wide, universally elected People's Congress" at the first representative meeting in 1949, but later it was "changed to be held during the slack farming season because it was the spring plowing season." But up to now, the representative meeting has been held seven times, and it has not yet exercised its powers. The reason for this is that the initial proposal was a draft drawn up by the higher authorities on behalf of the county, and the county simply did not understand what a People's Congress was. It had a great deal of blindness. After that, the higher authorities did not urge it, so it was put aside and no longer considered.
　　Xuanhua and Tianzhen counties had considered the issue of exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress. Tianzhen believed that the masses were not aware enough, the representatives were not well elected, and the district and village regimes were not sound enough to exercise their powers; Xuanhua felt that it was difficult to equip the government committee members and had no experience, so they did not know how to exercise their powers.
　　In short, the reasons for not exercising powers are: first, there is a lack of a developmental perspective on regime construction, the remnants of closed-doorism have not been overcome, and there is no recognition that the fundamental task of regime construction is to mobilize the broad masses of people to manage the affairs of the country and their own affairs. Moreover, they are accustomed to the old simple methods of leadership and work, and are not good at or willing to consult with people's representatives from all walks of life and carry out work together. The second is that they are bound by bourgeois "formal" democracy and narrow experience. They believe that exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress must involve a large set of formalities and must take a lot of time, therefore, it must be "changed to be carried out during the slack farming season." In addition, the higher authorities do not supervise and inspect the issue of exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress enough, and there are too few specific instructions, which makes the lower levels have nothing to follow. This is one situation.
　　There is also another situation: the people's representative meetings in Zhangbei and Huailai counties respectively exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress in March and September of last year. They gave the people a very deep impression and had a great impact. For example, after Wang Guilan, a labor model in Huailai, was elected as a government committee member, the masses in the seventh district reflected: "Even a child bride can be a government committee member, this is really the People's Government!" After Shi Ruyu from the industrial and commercial circles was elected as a government committee member, he felt that "under the People's Government, businessmen also have a place," and actively assisted the government in completing tax collection; after the Mongolian representatives in Zhangbei were elected as government committee members and the director of the Civil Affairs Section, ethnic relations quickly improved. It can be seen that as long as the powers are actually exercised, there are benefits. However, due to the county leaders' insufficient understanding of the basic system of the People's Representative Meeting, and insufficient attention to the positive role played by exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress, instead of consciously consolidating the further developed democratic system, they feel that it adds trouble and is a burden. The county head of Huailai County said: "It is really uncomfortable to hold a representative meeting!" The county government committee has only been convened twice from its establishment to the present. They completely regard exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress as a task assigned by the higher authorities, and after the election is over, it is considered finished. Even the election only cares about form and not substance. After Huailai elected the government committee members, Deputy Commissioner Wang asked twelve representatives about the election results. One labor model had the strongest memory and forgot two people; one public security officer circled every other name on the list of candidates; the other ten people circled one after another from the beginning to the end, or circled one after another from the end to the beginning. They were not clear about who they had elected. As for what other powers should be exercised, they had not considered it. When asked, even the county head was not very clear.
　　The common understanding of the county heads of Zhangbei and Huailai counties is: except for electing the county head and government committee members, there is no difference before and after exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress.
　　The reason why the exercise of powers becomes a formality and does not play its due role is actually the same as the reason for not exercising powers. They are both influenced by closed-doorism and formalism, thinking that once the ceremony is performed, everything is fine, and they are unwilling to hand over power to the People's Representative Meeting and make it the highest authority in the county.
(III)
　　According to the current situation in North China, military operations in various places have long ended, and land reform has been implemented in all areas except Suiyuan. People from all walks of life generally have their own organizations, can produce their own representatives, and elect their own governments. In particular, many old revolutionary base areas established people's democratic regimes as early as the War of Resistance Against Japan. Over the past ten years, they have undergone fierce revolutionary struggles and have been greatly consolidated and developed. Therefore, generally speaking, the objective conditions for exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress have been fully met. There is no reason to add conditions, raise standards, and deliberately restrict the people from exercising the democratic rights they have gained from arduous struggles!
　　However, according to the experience of Huailai and Zhangbei counties, in order to make the People's Representative Meeting actually, rather than formally, exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress, it is also necessary to solve the ideological problems of the leading cadres, understand the basic system of the People's Representative Meeting, and understand the necessity, significance, and specific content of exercising powers; and on this basis, in accordance with the provisions of national laws and regulations, hold good People's Representative Meetings from all walks of life, and make it a genuine organ for the people to exercise their own state power, rather than simply a place for the government to arrange work or a bridge between the government and the people. Then, further exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress. Otherwise, as mentioned above, even if the powers are exercised, the expected results cannot be achieved. But it should also be noted that, like other work, exercising powers is a process that must be gradually learned in movement, in practice, and in experimentation. Do not hope to achieve success in one fell swoop, otherwise, it is also an unrealistic requirement.
　　It should be emphasized here that the first and central issue of exercising powers is still elections. Only when the elections are well organized can other work have a reliable foundation. How can elections be well organized? There is not much systematic experience yet. Generally speaking, we should strive for the breadth of the representatives, taking into account the regions, all classes, all groups, all ethnic groups, and women, etc. The representatives of government agencies should be appropriately reduced. The methods for producing representatives should adopt a variety of mixed methods, such as direct elections, indirect elections, recommendations, and negotiated invitations, according to the specific circumstances. The election methods should also be based on the actual situation, adopting methods that are familiar to the masses, convenient for the people, and also solemn. In short, they should be able to concentrate the will of the people so that they can elect the people they are willing to elect. Full publicity and deliberation should be carried out in advance, and democracy should be freely promoted. Any acts of taking over, substituting, or coercive orders should be prohibited. The conditions for universal suffrage are generally not yet mature and should not be blindly adopted.
　　In the county people's government committee, people from all walks of life who are representative and capable should be widely absorbed to participate in order to expand the democratic foundation and the strength of joint work. According to what we saw in Chahar, it is very beneficial for county heads, deputy county heads, and government committee members to have certain local representatives elected to connect with the masses and go deep into the work. But there are difficulties in doing so. In addition to the difficulty in finding suitable candidates, living conditions are also a serious problem. In fact, when considering candidates, some counties often reluctantly give up because they are burdened by family life. This cannot be said to be a loss. In this regard, the Central People's Government should also properly plan remedial measures, appropriately taking care of their family life, and should not treat them entirely as general supply-system cadres or low-salary cadres.
　　In short, enabling county people's representative meetings to exercise the functions and powers of county people's congresses is an important political task for the current national regime construction, especially in North China. In order to complete this task, we must overcome all obstacles and difficulties!
　　The fundamental problem of the revolution is the problem of political power, and the work of regime construction is the foundation for carrying out all work. We must push forward the regime construction of the whole country and North China on the existing foundation!

### 普遍迅速地使县人民代表会议代行县人民代表大会职权是当前政权建设的重要任务

　　普遍迅速地使县人民代表会议代行县人民代表大会职权是当前政权建设的重要任务
    （北京大学法律系助教李由义）
  （一）
    今年四月二十四日，政务院在“关于人民民主政权建设工作的指示”中曾提出：“凡尚未代行人民代表大会职权的县、市各界人民代表会议，应积极创造条件，以便迅速代行人民代表大会的职权。”五月十一日，政务院政法委员会彭真副主任在“关于政法工作的情况和目前任务”的报告中又提出：“除尚未进行土地改革地区的县以下政府及有其他特殊情形者外，均应尽速创造条件，于本年内使人民代表会议代行人民代表大会的职权。”可见普遍地迅速地使县人民代表会议代行县人民代表大会职权，业已成为当前全国，特别是华北区政权建设迫切的重要任务。
    这一严重政治任务的提出，是完全有客观形势的根据并完全符合于客观形势的要求的。这个客观形势就是：目前全国正面临着大规模经济建设的准备工作，要求有强大的政权来领导和保障；特别是广大人民经过了抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命运动的教育，觉悟性和组织性都空前提高，要求加强民主的政治生活，要求作为行使自己国家政权的组织形式的人民代表会议，在组织基础上更广泛更密切地联系人民群众，在组织形式上也逐步地使它完备起来，也就是说，要求使人民代表会议迅速代行人民代表大会的职权。
    但是，在实际上，我们人民民主政权建设的工作，是落后于客观形势的发展的。单从代行职权情况来看，根据今年三月间的统计，在全国一九六一个开过各界人民代表会议的县中，已经代行人民代表大会职权的仅九○个县，（另有二十三个县开过人民代表大会）；根据最近统计，在华北三三一个县中，已经代行人民代表大会职权或召开人民代表大会的，仅二十个县。
  （二）
    各县人民代表会议普遍、迅速代行人民代表大会职权，就华北各地一般情况和若干县已有经验来说，基本不是条件问题，而是干部的思想认识问题。思想问题不加解决，就不会去积极创造条件，争取迅速代行；纵然代行，也会只是形式而不是实际的。
    我们这回在察哈尔所看到的情形就是如此。
    阳高县在一九四九年第一次代表会上就提出“召开全县的普选的人民代表大会”，后因“正值春耕，改在农闲季节进行”。但到现在，代表会议已经开过七次，尚未代行职权。究其原因，开始提出是上级代替县里拟定的草案，县里根本闹不清楚什么是人民代表大会。带有很大的盲目性。之后，上级不催，也就置诸脑后不再考虑了。
    宣化、天镇两县曾考虑过代行人民代表大会职权问题。天镇认为群众觉悟不够，代表没有选好，区村政权还不健全，不能代行；宣化则感政府委员人选很难配备，又无经验，不知怎样代行。
    总之，未代行的原因，一是对政权建设缺乏发展的观点，关门主义的残余没有克服，没有认识政权建设的根本任务就是发动广大人民群众管理国家的和自己的事务。而且习惯于老一套简单的领导方法和工作方法，不善于也不愿意与各界人民代表商量事情，共同进行工作。二是受资产阶级“形式”民主和狭隘经验的束缚。以为代行人民代表大会职权就必须搞一大套形式，必须化费许多时间，因此，必须“改在农闲季节进行”。此外，上级对代行人民代表大会职权问题，督促检查不够，具体指示太少，也使下边无所遵循。这是一种情况。
    还有一种情况：张北、怀来两县的人民代表会议分别在去年三月和九月代行了人民代表大会的职权。给予人民的印象都很深，影响都很大。例如怀来劳动模范王桂兰当选为政府委员后，七区群众反映：“童养媳也能当政府委员，真是人民政府了！”工商界史如玉当选为政府委员后，感到“在人民政府下，商人也有地位”，积极协助政府完成税收；张北蒙民代表被选为政府委员和民政科长后，民族关系迅速好转。可见只要切实代行职权，就有好处。但由于县的领导对于人民代表会议这一国家基本制度认识不足，对于代行人民代表大会职权所产生的积极作用重视不够，因而不是有意识地使进一步发展了的民主制度巩固下来，反而觉得增加麻烦，是个负担。怀来县县长说：“开代表会，实在很不舒服！”该县政府委员会从成立到现在也只召集过两次。他们对于代行人民代表大会职权，完全当作上级交下来的任务去完成，闹过选举，就算了事。就是选举，也只管形式，不问实质。怀来选举政府委员之后，王副专员找了十二个代表问选举结果，其中一劳动模范记性最强，忘记了两个人；一公安员是按着候选人名单隔一个圈一个；其余十人，有从头向后一个挨一个圈的，有从后向前一个挨一个圈的，到底选了谁，全记不清楚。至于还有那些职权应该代行，就没有考虑过，问起来，连县长都不甚了然。
    张北、怀来两县县长共同的认识是：除了选举县长和政府委员，代行人民代表大会职权前后没有什么区别。
    代行流于形式，不起应有作用，其原因与不代行实际上是一致的，都是受了关门主义和形式主义的影响，以为行过仪式，就算万事大吉，不肯把权力交给人民代表会议，使它成为全县的最高权力机关。
  （三）
    按照华北目前情况，各地军事行动早已结束，土地改革除绥远外均已实行，各界人民已普遍地有自己的组织，能够产生自己的代表，选举自己的政府。特别是许多革命的老根据地，远在抗日战争时期，就建立起人民民主政权，十余年来，经过激烈的革命斗争，且有很大的巩固和发展。因此，一般说来，代行人民代表大会职权的客观条件，已经完全具备。没有任何理由添加条件，提高标准，故意限制人民行使从艰苦斗争中得来的民主权利！
    但根据怀来、张北两县的经验，要使人民代表会议实际地而不是形式地代行人民代表大会的职权，还须解决领导干部的思想问题，认识人民代表会议这一国家基本制度，认识代行职权的必要、意义和具体内容；并在这样的基础上，按照国家法令规定，开好各界人民代表会议，使它成为名符其实的人民行使自己国家权力的机关，而不单纯是政府布置工作的场所或政府与人民间的桥梁。然后，再进一步代行人民代表大会职权。否则，如上所述，即使代行，也不能收到预期的效果。但也应该注意这样一个问题，即和其他工作一样，代行职权也是一个过程，必须在运动中、在实践中、在试验中逐步学会，不要希望一举功成，否则，也是不现实的要求。
    这里应该着重指出，代行职权首先的和中心的问题还是选举。选举办好了，其他工作才有可靠的基础。选举怎样才能办好？还没有很多有系统的经验。大体说来，应该力求代表的广泛性，既照顾地域，又照顾各阶层、各团体、各民族和妇女等各方面，政府机关代表应适当减少。代表产生方法应按具体情况，采取直接选举、间接选举、推选和协商邀请等多种多样的混合的方法。选举方式亦应根据实际情况，采取群众所熟悉的、便利于人民的、而又是严肃的方式，总之应该能够集中人民意志，使得他们能够选出自己所乐意选举的人来。事先应经充分宣传酝酿，放手发扬民主，任何包办代替强迫命令的行为应加禁止。普选条件一般尚未成熟，不应盲目采行。
    在县人民政府委员会中，应广泛吸收各方面的有代表性的有能力的人物来参加，以便扩大民主基础和共同工作的力量。根据我们在察哈尔所看到的情况，县长、副县长和政府委员中有一定的本地代表人物当选，对于联系群众，深入工作都有很大好处。但这样做，困难是有的，除了妥当人选不易物色外，生活待遇也是一个严重问题。事实上，有些县在考虑人选时，往往因他们为家庭生活所累而忍痛割爱。这不能不说是一个损失。对此，中央人民政府也应妥筹补救办法，适当照顾他们的家庭生活，不应全按一般供给制干部或低薪制干部待遇。
    总之，使县人民代表会议代行县人民代表大会职权是当前全国的特别是华北的政权建设的重要政治任务，为了完成这个任务，必须克服一切的障碍和困难！
    革命的根本问题是政权问题，政权建设工作又是开展一切工作的基础，我们必须使全国的和华北的政权建设在现有的基础上推进一步！
