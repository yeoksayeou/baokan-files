　　The United States Persists in Unreasonable Demands
    Attempting to Seize North Korean Tungsten and Manganese Mines
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch] The aim of the unreasonable demand made by the US representative at the Kaesong armistice talks to draw the military demarcation line north of the 38th parallel is to enable American monopoly capitalists and arms manufacturers to seize the tungsten and manganese mines in the area north of the 38th parallel. According to a dispatch from the Domei News Agency in Tokyo on the 21st, sources close to the US headquarters in Tokyo said that the US attitude at the Kaesong ceasefire talks is closely related to the trip to Korea by Kingsley, the American head of the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency.
    It is reported that before leaving for Busan, Kingsley had a long talk with General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the US Far East Command. During the meeting, he told Ridgway the instructions given to him by Wilson, Director of the US Defense Mobilization Agency. Kingsley said that Wilson had ordered him to investigate whether it was possible to utilize South Korea's raw materials and cheap labor resources to meet the large US industrial demand for Korean manganese and tungsten.
    Kingsley told Ridgway that American industrialists were extremely interested in the United Nations forces remaining in the area north of the 38th parallel because that is where the tungsten and manganese mines are located. Kingsley emphasized that not only Wilson, but also Grace, chairman of Bethlehem Steel, and Fairless, general manager of US Steel, believed that from the standpoint of US military production, obtaining these minerals would be the greatest victory. In this regard, Kingsley also mentioned MacArthur's views. Newspapers around the world have previously reported that MacArthur himself was very interested in exploiting North Korea's tungsten mines.
    In the end of the meeting, Kingsley told Ridgway that the State Department and President Truman fully supported Wilson's opinion: the United States troops must keep the North Korean tungsten mines in their hands at all costs.

### 美国坚持蛮横无理要求  竟图侵占朝鲜钨矿锰矿

　　美国坚持蛮横无理要求
    竟图侵占朝鲜钨矿锰矿
    【新华社讯】美国代表在开城停战谈判会议上坚持将军事分界线划在三八线以北的蛮横无理的要求，目的之一是要为美国独占资本家和军火制造商侵占三八线以北地区的钨矿和锰矿。据电通社东京二十一日电：接近东京美国总部的人士说，美国在开城停火会谈中的态度和联合国朝鲜复兴机构的美国总负责人金斯莱的朝鲜之行，有着密切的关系。
    据悉，金斯莱在动身前往釜山之前，与美国驻远东总司令李奇微作过一次长时间的会谈。在会谈中，他把美国国防动员署署长威尔生给他的训令告诉了李奇微。金斯莱说，威尔生曾命令他调查，是否有可能利用南朝鲜的原料与廉价劳工资源，以满足美国工业对于朝鲜的锰和钨的大量需要。
    金斯莱告李奇微说，美国工业人士对于联合国部队留在三八线以北地区一事极感兴趣，因为那里是钨矿和锰矿的所在地。金斯莱着重说明，不仅威尔生，而且“伯利恒钢铁公司”董事长葛雷斯、“美国钢铁公司”总经理费尔勒斯都认为，由美国军备生产的观点看来，取得这些矿藏可算是最大的胜利。关于这一点，金斯莱也提到了麦克阿瑟的看法，全世界报纸以前已经报道过，麦克阿瑟个人对于开采北朝鲜的钨矿很感兴趣。
    金斯莱在会谈中最后告诉李奇微，国务院和杜鲁门总统完全支持威尔生的意见：美国部队必须不惜一切代价把北朝鲜的钨矿留在手里。
