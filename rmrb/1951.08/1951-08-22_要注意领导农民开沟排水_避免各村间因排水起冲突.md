To the Editors:

Currently, with the rainy season upon us, it is crucial for district and township people's governments in areas prone to flooding to prioritize the planned and organized leadership of the masses in ditch digging and drainage. During a recent inspection of summer grain requisition work in rural areas, I encountered the following incident:

In mid-July, Xuzhou experienced two consecutive days of rain. After the rain, farmers Meng Zhaohua and Liu Zhensheng from Huji Village, Yian Township, in the suburbs, dug a two-foot-wide ditch on their land for drainage. However, the water had to flow westward through farmer Meng Guanglun's soybean field to be discharged, which they had not discussed beforehand. When they started to drain the water, Meng Guanglun refused to allow the water to flow through his land, so he reported to the village chief of Wangji Village. Wangji Village claimed that Huji Village was flooding their land and immediately dispatched more than twenty militiamen and thirty to forty farmers with guns, shovels, picks and other tools in a rage to Huji Village to arrest Meng Zhaohua, firing two shots as a warning. Fortunately, Huji Village immediately sent someone to Wangji Village to mediate, and the dispute was resolved peacefully.

On July 26th, I went to the Xiao County People's Government, and the county chief and others had gone to handle a case of people being beaten to death in a drainage conflict. It is reported that the incident occurred in Wucong Village. The cause of the incident was a conflict between the masses in Wangzhai District and Taolou District over digging ditches for drainage, resulting in a total of six people killed and injured on both sides (reportedly four dead and two injured). From the above incidents, it is clear that the leadership organs in some areas should attach great importance to leading the masses in ditch digging and drainage. They should educate the masses well about unity and mutual assistance and appropriately resolve the problems in their drainage efforts.

### 要注意领导农民开沟排水  避免各村间因排水起冲突

　　要注意领导农民开沟排水  避免各村间因排水起冲突
    编辑同志：
    目前雨季来临，在易受水灾的地区，有计划有组织地领导群众开沟排水是各区、乡人民政府不容忽视的工作。最近我到农村检查夏征工作时，曾发现这样的事件：
    徐州地区在七月中旬曾经连下了两天雨，郊区义安乡胡集村农民孟昭华和刘振升等在下雨之后，在自己地上扒了一道二尺宽的沟来排水。但是这地里的水须往西经过农民孟广伦的豆地才能排出去，事先他们并没有商议。等到排水时，孟广伦不同意水从他的地里流过，于是他就去报告了王集村的村长。王集村说胡集村放水淹他们的地，当时就派了二十多个民兵和三、四十个农民拿着枪和锨、钁等工具怒气冲冲地到胡集村把孟昭华捉去，并放了两枪示威。幸亏胡集村马上派人到王集村去调解，这件纠纷才得到了和平解决。
    七月二十六日我去到萧县人民政府，县长等都去处理为排水冲突打死人的案件了。听说，肇事地点在吴从村。肇事原因是王寨区与陶楼区群众扒沟排水发生冲突，结果双方共打死打伤六人（据谈死四人、伤二人）。从以上事件看，某些地区的领导机关，对于领导群众扒沟排水的事情，应该十分看重；应好好对群众进行团结互助的教育，并适当解决其排水中的问题。
