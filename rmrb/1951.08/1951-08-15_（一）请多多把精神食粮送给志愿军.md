(I) Please Send More Spiritual Food to the Volunteer Army

This issue of the journal publishes excerpts from a letter from the Volunteer Army Postal Distribution Section to the Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters. The letter states that the Volunteer Army units all hope that the people of the motherland can donate more picture-story books with correct content and easy-to-understand periodicals and pamphlets. We believe that this urgent request of the Volunteer Army should be satisfied.

According to reports received by this association, until recently, the Volunteer Army still did not receive sufficient spiritual food. Several months ago, this association began subscribing to 12,000 copies of the People's Daily to be sent to the front lines, but this quantity is far from enough for distribution to the Volunteer Army units. This association also purchased and donated 78 types of books (including picture-story books and other pamphlets) on resisting America and aiding Korea through the Xinhua Bookstore, but there were only 10,000 sets of each type. In addition, comrades from various regions and circles have also sent some books and periodicals to the Volunteer Army, but on the one hand, the quantity is still insufficient, and on the other hand, some of the donated books and periodicals are not entirely appropriate in content, some have content that is too deep and not suitable for the cultural level of the Volunteer Army soldiers, and some have incorrect content. Due to the unsatisfactory supply of spiritual food, coupled with the fact that the front line now has the possibility of spending more time on military training and learning, improving the supply of spiritual food to the Volunteer Army has become even more urgent.

According to verbal statements made recently by Volunteer Army postal personnel in Beijing, in addition to the People's Daily and general picture-story books and other pamphlets with correct and popular content, the following periodicals are suitable for the needs of the front line, and people from various regions and circles can refer to them when subscribing to periodicals for the Volunteer Army:

　　Picture-Story Book Pictorial, bi-monthly, published in Beijing, distributed by Xinhua Bookstore, 1,500 yuan per issue, 18,000 yuan for half a year;

　　Current Affairs Handbook, bi-monthly, published in Beijing, distributed by Xinhua Bookstore, 700 yuan per issue, 8,400 yuan for half a year;

　　Learning Elementary Edition, bi-monthly, published in Beijing, distributed by China Book Company, 1,400 yuan per issue, 16,800 yuan for half a year;

　　Resist America and Aid Korea Special Issue (single volume), weekly, distributed by the post office, 400 yuan per issue, 10,000 yuan for half a year (25 issues).

　　In addition, the "Study," "People's Weekly," "World Knowledge," "New Observer," "Literary Gazette," and "Xinhua Monthly" published in Beijing are also needed by the Volunteer Army cadres and soldiers with higher cultural levels, and can also be subscribed to and donated to the front.

### （一）请多多把精神食粮送给志愿军

　　（一）请多多把精神食粮送给志愿军
    本期本刊摘要发表了志愿军军邮发行股给新华书店总店的一封信。信中说：志愿军各部队都希望祖国人民能够多多赠送内容正确的连环图画和通俗易懂的期刊和小册子。我们认为，志愿军的这种迫切要求是应该予以满足的。
    根据本会所得到的报告，直到最近，志愿军仍然得不到充足的精神食粮。数月前，本会即开始订赠一万二千份人民日报送到前方去，但这个数量，远不够志愿军各单位分配。本会又曾经由新华书店购赠抗美援朝书籍（包括连环画及其他小册子）七十八种，但每种也只有一万套。此外，各地各界同胞也给志愿军寄赠了一些书刊，但一方面是数量仍嫌不足，另方面是有些赠送的书刊，内容不尽适当，有些是内容太深了，不适合志愿军战士们的文化水平，有些是内容不正确的。由于精神食粮供应状况的不能令人满意，再加上现时前线有了可能用更多时间来进行练兵和学习，改善对志愿军精神食粮的供应工作，就更加成为迫切需要了。
    根据志愿军邮局人员最近来北京所作的口头陈述，除人民日报以及一般内容正确而通俗的连环画及其他小册子外，期刊方面适合前线需要的有以下各种，各地各界人民订赠期刊给志愿军时可以参考：
    连环画报，半月刊，北京出版，新华书店发行，每期一千五百元，半年一万八千元；
    时事手册，半月刊，北京出版，新华书店发行，每期七百元，半年八千四百元；
    学习初级版，半月刊，北京出版，中国图书公司发行，每期一千四百元，半年一万六千八百元；
    抗美援朝专刊（单行本），周刊，邮局发行，每期四百元，半年（二十五期）一万元。
    此外，北京出版的《学习》、《人民周报》、《世界知识》、《新观察》、《文艺报》、《新华月报》等，志愿军的干部和文化水平较高的战士也是需要的，也可以订来赠送前方。
