Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 14th: Our front-line reporter reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, defending their positions, continue to inflict serious blows on the U.S. and Lee gangster troops who are constantly invading during the ceasefire negotiations. From the 1st to the 5th of this month, in addition to continuing indiscriminate bombing and strafing by the air force, the American aggressors also directed their ground forces to launch frequent attacks in areas north of Changdan near Kaesong, north of Gorampo-ri, and west of and north of Yeoncheon, east of Kimhwa, northwest of Yanggu, and northwest of Ganseong. However, they were met with increasingly strong resistance from the Korean and Chinese People's forces. In the area east of Kimhwa, fierce battles occurred almost every day. In order to seize the position, the U.S. and Lee armies suffered heavy casualties, but still forced their soldiers to launch repeated attacks; our defending troops carried out heroic and resourceful operations, so that the enemy not only could not steadily occupy the position, but also suffered heavy losses. In the second battle of counterattacking the highlands south of Black Cloud Ridge, a certain unit annihilated more than 230 enemies, while suffering only 35 casualties. In the five days from the 1st to the 5th, the Korean and Chinese People's forces annihilated a total of more than 2,000 enemies on the entire front. Most of them were American aggressor troops; in addition, 21 enemy planes were shot down or damaged over the front and rear.

　　美李匪军在停战谈判期间仍不断进犯
    中朝人民部队续歼敌二千余
    【新华社朝鲜前线十四日电】本社前线记者报道：扼守阵地的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，继续给予在停战谈判期间不断进犯的美、李匪军以严重打击。从本月一日到五日，美国侵略者除继续以空军滥施轰炸扫射外，并指挥其地面部队在靠近开城的长湍以北、高浪浦里以北地区及涟川以北以西、金化以东、杨口西北、杆城西北等地区发动频繁的攻击，但都遭到了朝、中人民部队的愈来愈强的抗击。在金化以东地区，差不多每日都有激烈的战斗发生。美、李军为夺取阵地，虽遭受重大伤亡，仍迫使其士兵进行反复攻击；我守军则进行英勇而机智的作战，使敌人不但不能稳占阵地，而且还遭受惨重损失。某部在反击黑云吐岭以南高地的二次战斗中，即歼敌二百三十余人，而自己仅伤亡三十五人。在一日至五日的五天中，朝、中人民部队在全线共计歼敌二千余人。其中大部分是美国侵略军；另外并在前线和后方上空击落、击伤了敌机二十一架。
