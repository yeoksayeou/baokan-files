Economic Life Trends

    The phenomenon of not being responsible for workers' lives is intolerable!
    Two incidents occurred in Beijing on August 15th due to rain causing worker's sheds to collapse, resulting in deaths and injuries. At the second construction zone of the China Construction Company in the western suburbs, a worker's shed collapsed due to rain, killing four carpenters and injuring thirteen. In the eastern suburbs, a temporary worker's shed built by Xingye Construction Factory for constructing the "Eastern Suburbs Flour Mill" also collapsed due to rain, injuring three workers. After the incident of the collapse of the brick and tile kiln factory of Yongmao Construction Company in the northern suburbs, after this newspaper criticized Yongmao Company for that incident, and after the Beijing Municipal People's Government dealt with that incident sternly, these two incidents happened again in one day not long after. This is really not supposed to happen and should be considered a great misfortune! Such irresponsibility for the lives of workers is intolerable! Relevant parties should severely punish those responsible for these two incidents. All government departments, factories, construction companies, etc. should pay close attention to this, and carefully inspect all dangerous buildings and temporary worker's sheds. If there are any dangers, effective measures should be taken immediately to avoid causing loss of life and property to the people.

    Prepare well for the acquisition of new cotton
    The new cotton will soon be harvested. In order for the yarn mills to resume full operation as soon as possible, it is necessary to make preparations for the acquisition of new cotton in a timely manner. The Shandong Provincial Finance and Economics Committee specifically convened a meeting of relevant departments to make thorough arrangements for this work. They analyzed the favorable and unfavorable conditions for this year's new cotton acquisition work based on the information reported by various regions; then, based on these conditions, they formulated specific methods for carrying out the preparatory work, determined to make full use of favorable conditions to overcome unfavorable conditions. In this way, on the one hand, the confidence of cadres in the acquisition of new cotton can be enhanced, and on the other hand, everyone will not become blindly optimistic when they see the new cotton coming onto the market soon, and then become pessimistic and helpless when encountering difficulties. Shandong Province's method of arranging work is scientific, and the specific methods formulated are also practical and feasible. As long as cadres at all levels give full play to their work enthusiasm and are good at grasping and promoting favorable conditions to overcome difficulties, the acquisition of new cotton will achieve good results.

    对工人生命不负责的现象是不能容忍的！
    北京市八月十五日因雨造成工棚倒塌而砸死、砸伤工人事件两起。西郊中国建筑公司第二工区工棚因雨倒塌，砸死木工四名，砸伤木工十三名。东郊兴业营造厂为承造“东郊面粉厂”厂房而建的临时工棚也因雨倒塌，砸伤工人三名。在永茂建筑公司北郊砖瓦窑厂房塌砸死工人事件之后，在本报对永茂公司的那次事件提出了批评之后，在北京市人民政府对那次事件作了严正的处理之后，没有多久，又在一天之中发生了这两个事件，实在是不应该的，应认为是很大的不幸！对于工人的生命如此不负责任，实在是不能容忍的！有关方面应对这两个事件的负责人员予以严厉处分。各机关、工厂、建筑公司等都应对这严加注意，对各危险建筑及临时工棚等加以认真检查，有危险的应即采取有效措施，以免造成人民生命财产的损失。
    做好收购新棉的准备工作
    新棉花不久以后就要开始收获了。为了使纱厂早日全部开工，及时做好收购新棉的准备工作是很必要的。山东省财政经济委员会专门召集了有关各部门开会，对这个工作作了周密的部署。他们根据各地汇报的情况，分析了今年新棉收购工作的有利条件和不利条件；然后又根据这些条件，订出了进行准备工作的具体办法，决心充分利用有利的条件去战胜不利的条件。这样，一方面可以增强干部对于收购新棉工作的信心，一方面可以使大家不至于看到新棉快上市了就盲目乐观起来，碰到困难时又会悲观失望束手无策。山东省这种布置工作的方法是科学的，订出的具体办法也是切实可行的，只要各级干部发挥高度的工作积极性，善于掌握和发扬有利条件去克服困难，新棉收购工作就会做出好的成绩。
