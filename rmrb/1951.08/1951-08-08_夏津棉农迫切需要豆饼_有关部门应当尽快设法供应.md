    Xiajin Cotton Farmers Urgently Need Bean Cake
    Relevant Departments Should Find Ways to Supply it Quickly
    It is now the season for topdressing cotton fields, and the masses urgently need bean cake. Some cotton farmers go to the cooperative to ask for bean cake, or request to withdraw the cotton that has been deposited in the cooperative in order to exchange it for bean cake on the market. Private merchants in Xiajin, Hebei, take the opportunity to raise the price of bean cake to 697 yuan per catty. Because of the lack of bean cake, the cooperatives cannot meet the needs of the masses in a timely manner, and the masses have to be exploited by private merchants. This situation has become a common phenomenon in the county, and there is an urgent need to find a solution to this problem.

    夏津棉农迫切需要豆饼
    有关部门应当尽快设法供应
    目前正当棉田追肥时期，群众迫切需要豆饼。有的棉农到社要求豆饼，或要求退出已存入合作社的棉花，到市场换豆饼。河北夏津私商乘机将豆饼价格提高到每斤六百九十七元。而合作社因缺乏豆饼，不能及时满足群众要求，群众不得不受私商盘剥。此种情况，已成为该县普遍现象，急需设法解决这个问题。
