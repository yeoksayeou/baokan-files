　　Self-Criticism Regarding Erroneous Propaganda of Party History
    Hebei Daily Editorial Department
    The article "The Communist Party of China is the Savior of the Chinese People," a propagandist's speech material published on page three of the June 18th issue of this newspaper (Hebei Daily), contained serious errors in its propaganda of the glorious struggle history of the Communist Party of China. These errors are mainly manifested in the following three aspects:

    First, the article omits the entire revolutionary historical stage of the Party from 1921 to 1927 in its overview of the thirty-year struggle history of the Communist Party of China. The article states in its overview of the Party's history: "Speaking only of the major ones, there were three major revolutions. The first was the Ten-Year Agrarian Revolutionary War, during which the Communist Party of China created the first most conscious and disciplined people's revolutionary army in Chinese history, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (the predecessor of the current People's Liberation Army), established the first revolutionary regime in Chinese history, and also led the national patriotic movement. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it led the Chinese people to defeat Japanese imperialism. In the three years of the War of Liberation, it led the Chinese people to annihilate eight million Kuomintang bandit troops, overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and establish our own people's country, the People's Republic of China. It achieved the great unity of all ethnic groups and the great unification of the country, implemented land reform, developed production, improved people's lives, and made our China a first-class powerful country in the world." Here, there is no mention of the First Revolutionary Civil War in China from 1921 to 1927. In the same paragraph, the terms "Ten-Year Agrarian Revolutionary War" and "Three-Year War of Liberation" are also incomplete; the correct and complete terms for these two periods of revolutionary war should be "Second Revolutionary Civil War" and "Third Revolutionary Civil War."

    Also, when explaining the harm caused to the Chinese people by the rule of imperialism in China, the third paragraph of the article states: "As soon as the Communist Party of China was established, it was determined to first remove the two major mountains weighing on the heads of the Chinese working people—imperialism and feudalism..." This statement is incomplete and incorrect. Because the two major enemies, imperialism and feudalism, are not only "mountains" weighing on the heads of the Chinese working people, but also "mountains" weighing on the heads of all Chinese people. The petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie in China also suffered from the oppression of these two reactionary forces.

    The explanation of the reasons for the victory of the Chinese revolution is also extremely incomplete and contains major errors. The article states in the fifth paragraph when referring to the reasons for China's victory: "This is because the Communist Party of China is the party of the most progressive and revolutionary class—the working class, and it is a party armed with Marxism-Leninism. Especially after the Communist Party of China had the wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese revolution steadily moved towards victory. ...Another reason for the victory of the Chinese revolution is that the Communist Party of China has thousands upon thousands of seasoned and strong cadres, and millions of outstanding party members who are loyal to the people's cause." Here, the revolutionary united front led by the Party with workers and peasants as the backbone, and the revolutionary armed struggle led by the Party, these important factors in the victory of the Chinese revolution, are not mentioned. The sentence "...since the Communist Party had the wise leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese revolution steadily moved towards victory" is also incomplete. Because the history of the Party proves that it was "after the leading position of Comrade Mao Zedong in the Central Committee and the whole Party was established" (Hu Qiaomu: Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China) that the Chinese revolution has been steadily moving towards victory.

    The above three are the main errors, and there are many other errors in wording and content in other places. For example, the last paragraph of the article says: "We must continue to follow Chairman Mao's instructions and move forward from victory to victory, towards socialist society, towards communist society." However, the current New Democratic society is not mentioned at all, obliterating the most important transitional stage in the development of Chinese society, which is obviously an error in principle.

    After the criticism of this article in the "Cultural Life" column of the People's Daily on July 18th and the suggestions from readers' letters, we made a detailed examination of the article and found that this propagandist's speech material had serious political errors, which caused readers to have many confused concepts and erroneous understandings of the Party's history.

    The reason for the occurrence of the above-mentioned serious errors is mainly that the editorial department of this newspaper did not treat the propaganda of the Party's history as an extremely serious and conscientious task, and did not carefully and repeatedly study it, but acted rashly. In handling the manuscript of Comrade Luo Su, the author of this article, we were extremely negligent. The publication was rushed, and there was a lack of careful deliberation and consideration. The review of the manuscript and the page proofs was careless, resulting in this oversight.

    In the future, we are determined to learn from this lesson, strengthen the study of important documents related to the history of the Party, improve our political and ideological level, and work with a highly responsible attitude, seriously and cautiously, to eliminate principled errors in newspaper propaganda.

　　关于错误宣传党史的检讨
    河北日报编辑部
    本报（河北日报）六月十八日三版刊登的《中国共产党是中国人民的救星》一篇宣传员讲话材料，对中国共产党光荣斗争历史的宣传，是有着严重的错误的，主要表现在以下三方面：
    首先，该文在概述中国共产党三十年斗争历史中，把党在一九二一年到一九二七年的整个革命历史阶段的经过给抹煞了。该文概述党的历史说：“光说大的就有三次大革命，第一个是十年土地革命战争，中国共产党创立了咱们中国历史上第一支最有觉悟最有纪律的人民革命军队工农红军（就是现在的人民解放军的前身），建立了咱中国历史上第一个革命政权，还领导了全国的爱国运动。抗战八年，又领导中国人民打败了日本帝国主义。三年解放战争，领导中国人民，歼灭了国民党匪军八百万，推翻了国民党的反动统治，建立了咱人民自己的国家中华人民共和国。实现了各民族人民大团结和全国大统一，实行了土地改革，发展了生产，改善了人民生活，使咱中国成了世界上第一流的大强国。”这里，对党在一九二一年到一九二七年中国第一次国内革命战争一字未提。同一段中“十年土地革命战争”及“三年解放战争”的提法，也是不完满的；对这两个时期的革命战争，正确、完满的提法应是“第二次国内革命战争”及“第三次国内革命战争”。
    还有，该文第三段说明帝国主义在中国的统治给予中国人民的危害时，说：“中国共产党一建立，就立志要首先铲掉压在咱中国劳动人民头上的两座大山——帝国主义和封建主义………”这种说法是不全面、不正确的。因为帝国主义封建主义这两大敌人，不仅是压在中国劳动人民头上的“大山”，而是压在全中国人民的头上的“大山”。中国的小资产阶级和民族资产阶级也同样受着这两种反动势力的压迫。
    在说明中国革命胜利的原因时，也是极不全面并有很大错误的。该文在第五段说到中国胜利的原因时说：“这是因为中国共产党是最进步最革命的阶级——工人阶级的政党，是用马克思列宁主义武装起来的政党。特别是中国共产党有了英明的领袖毛泽东主席以后，中国革命就稳步的走向了胜利。……中国革命取得胜利的另一个原因是，中国共产党有成千成万久经锻炼的坚强干部，有数百万忠实于人民事业的优秀党员。”这里，对党领导下的以工人、农民为骨干的革命统一战线和党领导下的革命武装斗争，这些中国革命胜利的重要因素，却未曾提到。这其中的“……自从共产党有了英明的领袖毛泽东主席以后，中国革命就稳步的走向了胜利”一句话，也是不完全的。因为党的历史证明是“确立了毛泽东同志在中央和全党的领导地位”（胡乔木：中国共产党三十年）之后，中国革命才一直走向胜利的。
    以上三处是主要的错误，其他地方在词句上、内容上都还有许多错误。如该文最后一段说：“咱们还要按照毛主席的指示接着走下去，从胜利走向胜利，走向社会主义社会、走向共产主义社会”。而对于今天的新民主主义社会一字未提，抹煞了中国社会发展最重要的一个过渡阶段，这显然是原则上的错误。
    经过人民日报七月十八日，在《文化生活》栏对该文的批评和读者来信的提示，我们才对该文做了详细检查，发觉这篇宣传员讲话材料存在着严重的政治性的错误，给读者造成很多对党的历史的糊涂观念和错误认识。
    发生上述严重错误的原因，主要是本报编辑部没有把宣传党的历史当作一件极其严肃认真的工作，没有仔细的反复的研究，而草率从事。在处理该文作者洛苏同志的稿件时，是极其疏忽大意的。发稿仓促，缺乏精细推敲考虑。审查稿件和大样时，粗心大意，致发生了这一漏洞。
    今后我们决接受这一教训，加强对党的历史有关的重要文件的学习，提高我们的政治、思想水平，并以高度负责的态度，严肃谨慎的工作，杜绝报纸在宣传上的原则错误。
