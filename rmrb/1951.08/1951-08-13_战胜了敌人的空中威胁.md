　　Vanquishing the Enemy's Air Threat
    Du Gao
    Anyone who has spent a considerable amount of time in the Korean battlefield, or who has traveled the long transportation lines, will deeply realize that the American aggressors' boasted "air superiority" is not worth a mention. The Chinese and Korean People's fighters have always despised the enemy's so-called "air superiority" and have overcome the threat of enemy aircraft with their unparalleled bravery. The enemy's indiscriminate bombing is not only of little use in actual combat, but cannot even hinder the smooth flow of our transportation lines.
    Since the start of the Korean armistice negotiations, the American aggressors have bombed Korean peaceful cities and villages even more frantically. In Dingzhou alone, more than a thousand civilian houses were destroyed. Enemy aircraft dropped more than two hundred time bombs at once on the ruins of Sariwon, and the green rice fields turned into a sea of fire. Children helping their mothers work in the fields were killed by enemy aircraft strafing; the roads were full of new bomb craters, and bridges were bombed every day. Every night, enemy aircraft set up so-called "air blockade lines" on the highways, dropping many flares with parachutes, vainly attempting to cut off our army's rear transportation lines. However, the Chinese and Korean people are constantly vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies. The people in the rear of Korea are supporting the front line with selfless labor, ensuring the smooth flow of roads and the timely repair of bridges. On all roads, one can see thousands of women carrying babies on their backs and sand on their heads, using their hands to pave the roads damaged by enemy bombing; wherever there are craters, they automatically repair them. Chinese and Korean laborers concentrate their efforts on repairing bridges. All roads and bridges that were bombed by enemy aircraft during the day are unobstructed at night, and hundreds and thousands of vehicles speed along the transportation lines, sending large quantities of supplies from the rear to the soldiers at the front. The so-called "air superiority" boasted by the American aggressors becomes so insignificant in the face of the power of the Chinese and Korean people that it cannot hinder the advance of vehicles in the slightest. Every night, on the dark highways, hundreds of Korean women and children greet the cars as they pass through small villages, inviting them to drink water and rest. Children climb onto the driver's platform and sing songs such as "The East is Red" happily with the drivers.
    The automobile drivers active on the transportation lines are full of confidence in victory. A young driver named Gao Zhizhong touched his car solemnly and said to me: "My car has run more than 10,000 kilometers in Korea, and there has never been an accident. The planes can't even touch its skin. Today is my 102nd time going to the front." I asked, "Isn't it dangerous to drive at night without lights because you can't see the road clearly?" He smiled, looked at his companion Li Liangxiang, and then said to me: "It's like walking in your own yard. Don't we know where there are thresholds and where there are bricks? We know the Korean roads like the back of our hands."
    There was a motorcade that created amazing results in the war. In the eight months of transportation work, they constantly fought with enemy aircraft. Under the day and night "blockade" of American aircraft bombing, forty-four drivers drove twenty-two trucks back and forth to the front and rear, without a single accident, without a single casualty, and without a single damaged vehicle. The drivers happily and confidently completed their tasks. Li Liangxiang just came back from the front yesterday in his car. Six enemy planes chased him along the way, but failed to hit his car. Today he is going to the front again. Li Chunfa leaned out of the car and said that he had not slept for ten nights. I asked him if the enemy bombing had increased the difficulty of the work. He said: "When I first arrived in Korea last winter, I felt that the enemy planes had many tricks. At that time, it was mainly because we had no experience, the weather was cold, and the roads were slippery, which did cause some difficulties; now we have figured out the enemy planes' routines, and we are familiar with the roads, so it doesn't matter how many enemy planes there are!" Gao Zhizhong also said: "It's really strange, when I first arrived in Korea, I couldn't see without lights. Now it's like walking in the daytime without lights."
    Isn't it the American aggressors' illusion to illuminate the roads with flares in order to find targets? But this is just the enemy's illusion.
    Lu Yonglu, who has been awarded two merits, said: "We have experience, he throws his flares, we go our way, we don't care about each other, the more lights he hangs, the clearer we can see. Sometimes the flares dropped by enemy planes stretch for fifteen miles along the way, and it takes a quarter of an hour to extinguish. With the light of these ten minutes, we can accelerate and drive twenty or thirty miles!" I asked him: "Won't the planes find you? Won't they strafe?" Liu Kegang, a young assistant from another car, rushed to say: "When I first arrived in Korea, I felt a little awkward when I saw flares for the first time. Now I understand that when the plane throws a flare, it can't see clearly on the plane either, the enemy's eyes are blurred, and the plane has to go around a big circle to find the target; at this time, you just rush forward, and by the time he is settled, I have already rushed to a very, very distant place!"
    These heroic automobile driver comrades are creating world-shaking heroic achievements for the peace of the motherland and the world! Li Liangxiang said: "We are fighting for peace, and we must win peace. If the American devils think that bombs can scare us, then they are dreaming. Our cars are hundreds of times more powerful than their planes!"
    This is only one side of the story. Another fact is that on the roadsides in Korea, you can see the wreckage of American planes shot down by the Chinese and Korean People's fighters everywhere. The heads of the planes are buried in the soil, with their gray tails sticking up; and more of them crash into the rocks, breaking into pieces....
    On the front and rear of Korea, the Chinese and Korean People's fighters and the Korean people have not only overcome the threat of enemy aircraft bombing, but are also crushing the enemy's so-called "air superiority" with heroic fighting.

### 战胜了敌人的空中威胁

　　战胜了敌人的空中威胁
    杜高
    任何一个人，只要他在朝鲜战地有相当时间，只要他在辽远的运输线上来往过，他就会深刻地认识到美国侵略者吹嘘的所谓“空中优势”是不值一顾的。中朝人民战士从来就渺视敌人的所谓“空中优势”，并且以他们无比的英勇战胜着敌机的威胁。敌机的狂轰滥炸，不但在实际的战斗中作用不大，甚至不能阻碍我们运输线的畅通。
    朝鲜停战谈判开始以后，美国侵略者更加疯狂地轰炸朝鲜和平城乡。单是定州一个地方的民房，就被炸毁一千多间。敌机在沙里院的废墟上，一次就扔下二百多枚定时炸弹，绿盈盈的稻田变成了一片火海。在田里帮助妈妈做活的孩子，被敌机扫射而死；公路上布满了新的弹坑，桥梁天天遭受着轰炸。每天晚上敌机在公路上布置着所谓“空中封锁线”，用降落伞投下许多照明弹，妄想切断我军后方交通线。但是，中朝人民时刻都在警惕着敌人的阴谋。朝鲜后方的人民，正以忘我的劳动支援前线，保证了道路的畅通和桥梁的适时修复。在一切道路上，都可以看到成千的妇女们，背上背着婴孩，头上顶着沙土，用双手铺平了敌炸坏的道路；那里出现了弹坑，她们就自动地修补好。中朝民工则集中力量抢修桥梁。一切在白天被敌机炸坏的道路与桥梁，到夜间便畅通无阻，成百成千部的车辆在运输线上飞驰，从后方把大批的供应品送给前线的战士们。美国侵略者所夸耀的所谓“空中优势”，在中朝人民力量面前，变得那样的渺小，以致不能丝毫阻止车辆的前进。每天晚上，在黑暗的公路上，汽车每经过一个小村子，都有上百个朝鲜妇女和孩子在招呼他们喝水和休息。孩子们爬到司机台上和司机们一起愉快地唱着《东方红》等歌曲。
    活跃在运输线上的汽车司机同志们对胜利满怀信心。一个年青的司机高志忠摸着他的车子严肃地对我说：“我这部车子，在朝鲜跑了一万多公里了，一回事故都没有出，飞机连它的皮也碰不着。今天是我第一百○二次上前方了。”我问：“夜晚开车，不打灯，看不清路不危险吗？”他笑了，望一望他的同伴李良相，然后对我说：“就好比在自家院子里走路一样，那儿有门槛那儿有砖头还不清楚？朝鲜的道儿我们都摸得烂熟了。”
    有一个汽车队，在战争中创造了惊人的成绩，他们在八个月的运输工作中，不断和敌机搏斗。在美国飞机狂轰滥炸的日夜“封锁”下，四十四个司机同志驾驶着二十二部大卡车奔驰在前方和后方，没有出过一次事故，没有过一个伤亡，一部车子也没有损坏。司机同志们愉快地满怀信心地完成着任务。李良相昨天才开着车子从前方回来，沿路六架敌机向他追击，但始终未能打着他的车子。今天他又要到前方去。李春发从车里伸出头来说，他已经十夜没有睡觉了。我问他敌机的轰炸是不是增加了工作的困难，他说：“去年冬天刚到朝鲜的时候，还觉得敌机花样不少，那时候主要是我们没有经验，天又冷，路又滑，确有些困难；现在敌机的路数都被我们摸熟了，路也熟了，敌机再多也不碍事！”高志忠也说：“真是怪事，刚到朝鲜的时候，不打灯硬是看不见，现在不打灯就好像白天走路一样。”
    美国侵略者不是幻想借照明弹把道路照亮，以便找寻目标？可是这仅仅是敌人的幻想。
    立过两次功的吕永禄说：“我们有经验啦，他扔他的照明弹，我们走我们的，谁也不管谁，他的灯挂得越多，我们走起路来越看得清楚。有时敌机扔下的照明弹沿途长达十五里，要一刻钟才熄灭，借这十多分钟的亮，我们加足劲儿可以赶二三十里路！”我问他：“飞机不会发现你么？不扫射么？”另一部车上的年青助手柳克刚抢着说：“刚到朝鲜的时候，头一回见了照明弹心里有点别扭。现在可闹清啦，飞机一扔照明弹，飞机上面也看不真，敌人的眼睛也花了，飞机要绕一个大圈子才找得着目标；这时候，你只管冲好了，等他定了神，我已经冲到老远老远的地方去了！”
    这些英雄的汽车司机同志们，为了祖国和世界的和平，创造着震撼世界的英雄业迹！李良相说：“我们是为和平来打仗的，一定要把和平打到手。如果美国鬼子以为炸弹可以吓唬我们，那才是梦想哩，我们的汽车比他的飞机要厉害几百倍！”
    这还仅仅是事实的一面。另一种事实是：在朝鲜的道旁，到处都可以见到被中朝人民战士击落的美国飞机的残骸，飞机的脑袋埋葬在土里，翘起那个灰色的尾巴；并且有更多的撞在山岩上，粉身碎骨……。
    在朝鲜的前线和后方，中朝人民战士和朝鲜人民不但战胜了敌机狂轰滥炸的威胁，而且正以英勇的战斗在粉碎着敌人的所谓“空中优势”。
