Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th. This reporter learned from the headquarters at the Korean front that the United Nations Command delegation still had not arrived at Kaesong on August 6th, so the Korean armistice negotiation meeting could not be held.

　　After General Ridgway, Commander of the United Nations forces, raised the issue of our side's guard personnel violating the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement on August 5th, Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai, in order to prevent the negotiation meeting from being hindered by such occasional trivial incidents, replied via radio broadcast at 7:00 AM (Korean time) on August 6th, guaranteeing that accidental incidents of our guard troops violating the Neutral Zone Agreement would not occur again, and requested the other side's delegation to come to Kaesong for the meeting immediately. Our delegation also transmitted a written reply through liaison officers to the United Nations Command delegation at 8:00 AM on the 6th. However, the United Nations Command delegation has not yet responded and has not come to Kaesong for the meeting, with the result that the world-renowned armistice negotiation meeting could not be held on the morning of August 6th.

　　美方代表仍未来开城
    停战谈判会议昨又未能举行
    【新华社平壤六日电】本社记者由朝鲜前线总部获悉：八月六日联合国军代表团仍未来开城，朝鲜停战谈判会议因此未能举行。
    八月五日联合国军总司令李奇微将军，提出我方警卫人员违反开城中立区协议的事件以后，金日成将军与彭德怀将军为了使谈判会议不致因这类偶发的枝节事件而受到阻碍，已在八月六日上午七时（朝鲜时间）通过广播答复，保证我方警卫部队不再发生违反中立区协议的偶然事件，并请对方代表团即来开城赴会。我方代表团又在六日上午八时将书面复文通过双方联络官转交联合国军代表团。但联合国军代表团方面至今尚无答复，亦未前来开城赴会，以致举世瞩目的停战谈判会议在八月六日晨未能举行。
