    Editor's Note: It is highly necessary for the CPC Ding County Local Committee to focus on inspecting the ideological state of affairs of Party branches in government offices. On the basis of this inspection, they helped the branches formulate plans to strengthen ideological leadership for Party members and cadres, closely integrating the Party's ideological and political work with the specific work of each Party member. This experience can be used as a reference for other regions.

    On July 3rd, the CPC Ding County Local Committee inspected the Party organizations of the Ding County Special District Telecommunications Bureau and the Ding County Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, discovering that many Party members and cadres seriously exhibited a tendency to disregard politics. The Local Committee also urged the Party branch of the Telecommunications Bureau to conduct a self-criticism and formulate a plan to strengthen ideological and political leadership for Party members and cadres in the future.

    Through the patriotic education of resisting America and aiding Korea over the past eight months, the political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of Party members and cadres in these two units have been significantly improved, and there have been many improvements in their work. However, many Party members and cadres still disregard politics, do not pay attention to current political events, and do not conscientiously study relevant political documents. As a result, they have an unclear understanding of the main policies currently being implemented and the major political events that are occurring, or they are completely unaware of them.

    During the Local Committee's inspection of the Party organization of the Ding County Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, it was found that out of 27 Party members and cadres, 20 did not know about the policy of combining suppression of counter-revolutionaries with leniency, or the policy of "sentencing to death with a two-year reprieve, forced labor, to observe the effect." At that time, the patriotic cotton selling and storage movement was a major political task of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, but some cadres did not understand its significance. Ma Tongying, an accounting trainee at the company, even unilaterally believed that the patriotic cotton selling and storage movement was only for the benefit of the peasants by giving them interest; she knew nothing about its great significance for national economic construction and the lives of the military and civilians. In May, the United Nations, under the manipulation of American imperialism, illegally passed an "embargo" against China and North Korea. More than two-thirds of the cadres in the company were unaware of this event. Before July 1st, the propaganda tasks assigned by the Ding County Local Committee to the company's Party branch were not completed according to plan.

    Due to the leadership's neglect of ideological and political leadership, some Party members and staff of the Ding County Special District Telecommunications Bureau also seriously exhibited a tendency to disregard politics. The bureau subscribed to a total of twelve copies of the People's Daily, Hebei Daily, Workers' Daily, and Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Newspaper, but half of the people did not read them; the personnel in the engineering team also did not read newspapers. They mistakenly believed that enterprise departments have little to do with politics, and that it is enough to complete the tasks. Some personnel, starting from personal interests, believed that "you can't get by without technology, you can't get by without culture, but it doesn't matter if you don't have politics." Therefore, they were very active in attending cultural classes every day, but when studying political documents on Mondays and Saturdays, they were careless. This tendency to disregard politics seriously harmed the further development of the bureau's work. For example, Cao Hengshun, a fourth-class line worker, said: "I earn this little millet, so I do this little millet's worth of work." During this inspection, the comrades of the bureau's Party branch first conducted a self-criticism of the above situation, believing that this was mainly due to the branch's neglect of ideological and political leadership, failure to pay attention to correcting the incorrect understanding of some personnel, and failure to improve their political awareness. For example, in carrying out the patriotic production competition, the branch only paid attention to achievements and figures, and did not pay attention to strengthening the political education of Party members, and rarely carried out communist education for them, resulting in a rather thin political atmosphere in the government office.

    After self-criticism, the Party branch of the Ding County Special District Telecommunications Bureau has formulated a plan to strengthen ideological and political leadership in the future based on the bureau's situation. First, conduct an inspection in conjunction with the current study of the Party's history to help everyone improve their understanding and formulate ways to overcome the tendency to disregard politics. Second, regularly pay attention to the ideological and political leadership of all personnel, designate special personnel to be responsible, rectify the work of propaganda personnel, organize reading groups, and establish a system of political study inspections and tests. The Party branch, the Communist Youth League branch, the trade union, and the administration will jointly formulate a plan to strengthen the political education of all personnel. Third, closely integrate political education with the overall work of the bureau. At present, it is necessary to seize the time to inspect and revise the patriotic pact, carry out criticism and self-criticism, so that all personnel actively participate in political activities, in order to continuously improve their ideological and political level and work efficiency.

### 中共定县地方委员会  重点检查机关支部思想状况  督促制订加强思想领导的计划

    中共定县地方委员会
    重点检查机关支部思想状况
    督促制订加强思想领导的计划
    编者按：中共定县地委会重点检查机关支部思想状况是很必要的。他们在检查的基础上帮助支部制订了对党员、干部加强思想领导的计划，使党的思想政治工作同每个党员的具体业务密切结合起来，这个经验可供各地参考。
    中共定县地方委员会在七月三日对定县专区电信局、中国花纱布公司定县分公司党组织进行检查，发现很多党员和干部严重地存在着不问政治的倾向。地委并督促该电信局党的支部做了检讨，订出了今后对党员、干部加强思想政治领导的计划。
    经过过去八个月的抗美援朝爱国主义教育，该两单位的党员、干部的政治认识和爱国热情已有显著提高，在工作上有了不少改进。可是有不少党员和干部，却不问政治，不关心当前的政治事件，不认真学习有关的政治文件，因此他们对当前实施的主要政策和发生的重大政治事件认识不清，或根本不知道。
    地委检查中国花纱布公司定县分公司党组织时，发现在二十七个党员和干部中，有二十人对镇压反革命和宽大相结合的政策，以及“判处死刑，缓期二年，强迫劳动，以观后效”的政策都不知道。当时开展爱国售棉储棉运动，是花纱布公司的重大政治任务，可是有的干部竟不了解其重大意义。该公司会计练习生马同英，对为什么开展爱国售棉储棉运动，竟片面地认为是给农民生利息；对关系着国家经济建设和军民生活的伟大意义一无所知。五月间，联合国在美帝国主义操纵下非法通过了对中朝两国的“禁运案”，对这一事件，该公司有三分之二以上的干部都不知道。在“七一”前，定县地委分配给该公司党支部的宣传任务，也没有按照计划完成。
    由于领导上忽视思想政治领导，定县专区电信局有些党员和职员同样也严重存在着不问政治的倾向。该局订有人民日报、河北日报、工人日报、邮电工人报共十二份，可是有一半人不看；工程队的人员也不看报纸。他们错误地认为：企业部门和政治没有多大关系，只要完成任务就行。有的人员从个人利益出发，认为“没有技术吃不开，没有文化吃不开，没有政治不要紧”，因此，每天上文化课时都很积极，可是当星期一、星期六学习政治文件时，都马马虎虎。这种不问政治的倾向，严重地危害了该局工作的进一步开展。如四等机线员曹恒顺说：“我挣这点小米就作这点小米的工作。”该局党的支部同志在这次检查中，对上述情况首先做了自我检讨，认为这主要是支部忽视思想政治领导、没注意纠正某些人员的不正确认识和提高他们的政治觉悟所致。如在开展爱国主义生产竞赛中，支部只注意成绩和数字，没有注意加强对党员的政治教育，也很少对他们进行共产主义的教育，致使有的党员不注意研究政治问题。这样就形成了机关政治空气相当稀薄的现象。
    定县专区电信局党的支部，经过检讨以后，已根据本局情况订出今后加强思想政治领导的计划。第一，结合目前学习党的历史进行一次检查，帮助每个人提高认识，订出克服不问政治倾向的办法。第二，经常注意对全体人员的思想政治领导，指定专人负责；并整顿宣传员工作，组织读报组，建立政治学习的检查和测验制度。党支部、团支部、工会和行政共同拟定加强全体人员政治教育的计划。第三，把政治教育和全局的业务工作密切结合起来。目前要抓紧时间检查修订爱国公约，开展批评与自我批评，使全体人员积极参加政治活动，以不断提高自己的思想政治水平和工作效率。
