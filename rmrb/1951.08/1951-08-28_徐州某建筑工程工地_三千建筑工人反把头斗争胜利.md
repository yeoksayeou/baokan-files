    Three Thousand Construction Workers in Xuzhou Achieve Victory in Struggle Against Foremen
    Under the leadership of the Xuzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, workers at a construction site of the East China Construction Engineering Company in Xuzhou, from April to June, overthrew the feudal foremen, settled wage accounts, and improved the workers' level of consciousness and work enthusiasm.
    This project was contracted out by the Xuzhou Branch of Shandong Construction Engineering Company in October last year. However, instead of undertaking the work themselves, the company adopted a method of subcontracting layer upon layer (the company contracted the project and subcontracted it to private construction firms, who in turn subcontracted it to many foremen). This gave the foremen a good opportunity to exploit the workers. There were more than thirty ways in which the foremen exploited the workers. Regarding wages: for example, the company stipulated that the wage for each cubic meter of stone from Kaiming Mountain was 30 catties of millet, but the workers actually only received 23 to 25 catties; the company stipulated that the wage for each cubic meter of stone from the dark tunnels was 60 catties of millet, but the workers actually only received 52 catties. The "Xinmin Construction Firm" (nominally a "construction firm," but actually a foreman) alone exploited the workers for 300,000 catties of millet from this project. The workers' meals were all managed by the foremen, who inflated the price of grain and calculated weight at 14 taels per catty, thus making a profit of more than 10,000 yuan per bag of flour. It was originally agreed with the workers that they would eat coarse grain at 3 catties of millet per day, but at the end of the month, 4 catties were deducted. The foremen received tool fees, management fees, medical fees, and cooking utensil fees from the branch company, but not only did they not disclose the expenditure accounts to the workers, but they also deceived the workers and demanded another copy from them; for the lamp oil fee alone, 4.95 million yuan was deducted from the workers in one tunnel. The wages of the supervisors hired by the foremen, in addition to scolding the workers, also had to be borne by the workers. Some foremen, in order to place their relatives and friends, arbitrarily added the title of "group leader" and demanded 16,000 yuan per day from the workers as "management fees." Some workers had all their wages for fifty days deducted in this way. Some worked for more than two months and only received 40,000 yuan in wages. Many workers did not even have travel expenses to return home during the Spring Festival this year, and some apprentices were so hungry that they had to pull up wheat seedlings to fill their stomachs. The workers could no longer bear it, and elected representatives to ask the foremen for wages, but the foremen expelled these more than ten workers together on charges of being "reactionary elements" and "troublemakers."
    The foremen also paid no attention to the workers' safety. According to statistics, from mid-November last year to the end of March this year, a total of 29 accidents occurred, resulting in 5 deaths, 10 serious injuries, and 15 minor injuries. The government had given them serious instructions that the safety of the workers must be guaranteed. This instruction did not arouse their attention at all. They did not take any active measures to prevent accidents, but simply secretly sent the workers away and were done with it when casualties occurred. When worker Liu Zhankui's eyes were injured by an explosion, the foremen secretly sent him home and did not provide any further treatment. If workers became ill, they were not given treatment, and were even immediately driven away.
    In April, the workers jointly complained to the Xuzhou Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau about the foremen's criminal facts. The Xuzhou Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, together with the Xuzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, immediately sent cadres to investigate and deal with the matter. Under the leadership of the trade union, the workers launched a struggle against the foremen. First, the workers in two tunnels accused the "Xinmin Construction Firm" of its crimes, inspiring more than 3,000 workers in other tunnels to speak out. After convening representative meetings and general worker meetings, it was calculated that 684,300 catties of millet had been exploited from the workers. Nine foremen with serious crimes have been sent to the court for legal processing. Other smaller foremen have been given education to let them repent and start anew. This method of separate treatment has had a great educational effect on the foremen. For example, Sun Huailan, the foreman who contracted a certain project, automatically went to the trade union to return all the money he had exploited from the workers after hearing the news about the struggle against the foremen.
    After dealing with the foremen and returning the workers' rightful wages, the workers' enthusiasm quickly rose, and they were willing to do a good job in production. Worker representative Zhao Yukun and others proposed at the representative meeting: "We must strive to complete the project ahead of schedule to resist US aggression and aid Korea." At the same time, the workers donated 20,000 catties of millet to buy planes and cannons. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the workers spontaneously reported several counter-revolutionary elements.
    After overthrowing the foremen, some new systems were established on the construction site, and safety equipment was strengthened. The workers consciously abide by these systems.

### 徐州某建筑工程工地  三千建筑工人反把头斗争胜利

　　徐州某建筑工程工地
    三千建筑工人反把头斗争胜利
    徐州市总工会领导着华东某建筑工程工地的工人，在四月到六月份，反掉了封建把头，清算了工资账目，提高了工人的觉悟程度和工作积极性。
    这项工程，是去年十月间由山东建筑工程公司徐州分公司承包修建的。但该公司承包后不是自己来作，而采取了层层转包办法（公司包下工程，转包给私人营造厂，营造厂再转包给许多包工把头），这就给了把头们一个剥削工人的好机会。把头们剥削工人的方式有三十多种。在工资方面：例如开明山的石头，公司规定每方工资小米三十斤，但工人实际只领到二十三斤到二十五斤；开暗洞的石头，公司规定每方工资小米六十斤，工人实际只得五十二斤；只“新民营造厂”（名为“营造厂”，实际是把头）单从这一次工程中，就剥削了工人三十万斤小米。工人伙食统由把头来办，把头把粮食价钱以贱算贵，分量以十四两算一斤，这样每袋面粉就可以赚工人一万多元。原给工人说妥吃粗粮每天小米三斤，但到月终算账时，硬扣了四斤。把头从分公司领了工具费、管理费、医药费、炊具费，开支账目不但不向工人公开，反欺瞒工人，跟工人再要一份；只灯油费一项，一个洞内，就扣了工人四百九十五万元。把头们雇的监工人员，辱骂工人不算，他们的工资也要叫工人负担。有的把头为了安插自己的亲友，随便加个“组长”的名义，向工人每天要一万六千元“管理费”。有的工人五十天工资全被这样扣光。有的干了两个多月，只得到四万元工资。许多工人在今年春节时连回家路费都没有，有的小工饿得没法，只得拔麦苗来充饥，工人忍无可忍，选出代表去向把头要工资，把头便把这十多个工人用“反动分子”、“捣蛋”等罪名一齐开除。
    把头对工人安全问题也毫不注意。据统计：从去年十一月中旬到今年三月底，总共发生了事故二十九次，死五人、重伤十人、轻伤十五人。政府曾向他们严重指示：必须要保障工人安全。这个指示，丝毫也没有引起他们的重视。他们没有采取什么积极的办法防止，只是再发生了伤亡事故时，瞒着政府偷偷把工人打发走了完事。工人刘占魁眼睛被炸伤，把头们就偷着把他送回家，再不管医治。工人病了，也不给治疗，甚至马上被赶走。
    工人们四月份联名向徐州市人民政府劳动局控告了把头们的罪恶事实。徐州市人民政府劳动局联合了徐州市总工会马上派干部去调查处理，工人在工会的领导下，掀起了反把头斗争。首先有两个山洞的工人控诉了“新民营造厂”的罪恶，启发其他洞的三千多工人也起来讲话。召开了代表会和全体工人大会后，清算出被剥削的工资米六十八万四千三百多斤小米。九名罪恶重大的把头，已被送到法院依法处理。别的小把头，都给以教育，让他们悔过自新。这种分别处理的办法，对把头的教育作用很大。如承包某工程的把头孙怀兰，听到反把头的消息后，自动到工会把剥削工人的款子全部退还工人。
    处理了把头，退还了工人应得的工资，工人热情就很快高涨起来，愿意搞好生产。工人代表赵玉坤等在代表会上提出：“我们要努力提前完成工程任务来抗美援朝”，同时，工人们又捐出了两万斤小米来买飞机大炮。在镇压反革命运动中，工人自动检举了几个反革命分子。
    斗倒把头后，工地上建立起一些新的制度，并加强了工地的安全设备，工人们都自觉地遵守这些制度。
