　　Q: How should the families of counter-revolutionaries be treated?

　　A: The People's Government suppresses counter-revolutionaries by punishing only the counter-revolutionary criminals themselves. The families of counter-revolutionaries, as long as they have not participated in counter-revolutionary activities and can abide by government laws and decrees, will never be implicated or discriminated against. However, if the family members of counter-revolutionaries also directly participated in counter-revolutionary activities, then they themselves are also counter-revolutionaries, and the government must punish them according to the regulations for the punishment of counter-revolutionaries with the crimes they deserve.

　　Specifically, regarding the families of counter-revolutionaries, we should treat them differently according to their attitude towards the suppression of counter-revolutionary movement.

　　Many family members of counter-revolutionaries have adopted a correct attitude in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement, that is, they reported and accused their counter-revolutionary relatives with the spirit of placing righteousness above family loyalty. Therefore, they have been warmly welcomed and supported by the government and the people.

　　However, there are still some family members of counter-revolutionaries who do not understand the greater good and express "unwillingness" about the suppression of their counter-revolutionary relatives. They unreasonably pester and cry to the government, and some even instigate relatives, friends, and neighbors to sign joint guarantees, demanding that the government release their counter-revolutionary relatives. These family members of counter-revolutionaries did not report their counter-revolutionary relatives to the government, and the government has been lenient by not pursuing the matter; but now they still do not sever ties with the counter-revolutionaries, which makes it easy for them to be used by the counter-revolutionaries and completely lose the position of the Chinese people. The government does not give up on educating these people; they should also accept the government's education well, sever ties with the counter-revolutionaries without hesitation, and change their wrong attitude.

　　In addition, a very small number of family members of counter-revolutionaries have been found in various places to be stubbornly unrepentant, hostile to the people, and engaging in retaliatory and destructive activities. These people themselves are already counter-revolutionaries, and the government will severely punish them according to the regulations for the punishment of counter-revolutionaries. Everyone has the right to monitor and report such counter-revolutionaries so that their counter-revolutionary conspiracies will not succeed.

　　Finally, it must be pointed out that the vast majority of counter-revolutionaries suppressed in this vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries are those who have been floating on the surface of society and riding on the backs of the people for a long time; there are still many special agents and spies of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and other counter-revolutionaries who remain to be wiped out. The families of these counter-revolutionaries should, in the spirit of placing righteousness above family loyalty, quickly report them to the government. Otherwise, the whole family may be dragged down by the counter-revolutionaries.

　　Regarding the handling of the property of counter-revolutionary criminals and the livelihood of the families of counter-revolutionaries, Article 17 of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries" stipulates: "Those who commit crimes under these regulations may be deprived of their political rights and may have all or part of their property confiscated." The "Regulations on Confiscation of Property of Counter-Revolutionary Criminals" recently promulgated by the Government Administration Council specifically stipulates that when confiscating all the property of counter-revolutionary criminals, "production materials and living materials should be appropriately retained for family members living together who have not actively participated in counter-revolutionary activities so that they can maintain their lives." "The property of family members who do not live with them or the property owned by individual family members who live with them shall not be confiscated." "The property of poor counter-revolutionary criminals shall not be confiscated," etc., giving a way out for the families of counter-revolutionaries who have not actively participated in counter-revolutionary activities. However, the families of counter-revolutionaries must actively engage in production and change their past parasitic life of relying on counter-revolutionaries for support.

### 怎样对待反革命分子的家属？

　　怎样对待反革命分子的家属？
    问：怎样对待反革命分子的家属？
    答：人民政府镇压反革命，只是惩办反革命罪犯本人。反革命分子的家属，只要他们没有参加反革命活动，并能遵守政府法令，就决不株连和歧视。但如果反革命分子的家属也直接参加了反革命活动，那么其本身也是反革命分子，政府就得按惩治反革命条例治以应得的罪。
    具体说来，对于反革命分子的家属，我们应该根据他们对镇压反革命运动的态度，给以不同对待。
    不少反革命分子的家属，在镇压反革命运动中，采取了正确的态度，即以大义灭亲的精神检举、控告了他们的反革命亲属，因之他们已经受到政府和人民的热情欢迎与赞助。
    但是还有一些反革命分子的家属，不明大义，对其反革命亲属的被镇压表示“不甘心”。他们无理地向政府纠缠、哭闹，有的甚至煽动亲友邻闾签名联保，要求政府释放他们的反革命亲属。这些反革命分子的家属未向政府检举其反革命亲属，政府未加追究，已属宽大；而现在他们仍不与反革命分子断绝联系，这样，就很容易被反革命分子利用，而完全丧失中国人民的立场。政府是不放弃对这些人的教育的；他们也应该很好地接受政府的教育，毫不犹豫地割断和反革命分子的联系，改变自己的错误态度。
    此外，各地也发现有极少数反革命分子的家属，表现顽固不化，与人民为敌，进行报复破坏活动。这些人本身已经是反革命分子了，政府将根据惩治反革命条例，予以严惩。对于这样的反革命分子，人人有权监视、检举，不让他们的反革命阴谋得逞。
    最后还必须指出，这次大张旗鼓镇压反革命，已被镇压的大部是浮在社会上面、历来就爬在人民头上作恶的反革命分子；还有不少帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮的特务间谍及其他反革命分子，有待于我们继续肃清。这些反革命分子的家属，应该以大义灭亲的精神，赶快向政府检举。否则，一家人都有可能被反革命分子拖下去的危险。
    关于反革命罪犯的财产处理及反革命分子家属的生活问题，“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”第十七条规定：“犯本条例之罪者，得剥夺其政治权利，并得没收其财产之全部或一部。”最近政务院颁布的“关于没收反革命罪犯财产的规定”中并具体规定了没收反革命罪犯全部财产时，“对其共同生活而未积极参预反革命活动的家属，应酌留生产资料与生活资料，使能维持生活。”“对于不与其共同生活的家属之财产或与其共同生活的家属个人所有之财产，均不予没收。”“反革命罪犯之贫穷者，其财产不予没收。”等条款，给未积极参预反革命活动的反革命分子的家属以生活出路。但反革命分子的家属必须积极从事生产，改变过去依靠反革命分子来赡养的寄生生活。
