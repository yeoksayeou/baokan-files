Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 31st - On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day of the People's Liberation Army, combat heroes and model workers of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army enthusiastically wrote letters to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to pay their respects, and to report on the achievements made in the past year in carrying out the glorious tasks of coastal defense, bandit suppression, and building a regular and modern national defense army. Those who wrote letters included combat heroes Wang Lihe, Zhang Xiuliang, Zhang Chunli, Wang Liansheng, Dai Xianyun, Liu Yurui, who attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes, model air force mechanic Chi Shaohua, model navy worker Sui Shude, tank hero Shen Xu, artillery hero Wang Gongyi, engineer hero Ni Fu, model worker of political organs Zhuang Xinyi, etc.

In a letter, Shen Xu, the company commander of the "Zhu De" tank driver and tank hero, described the hard work and practice they had put in to learn tank technology. He organized all the soldiers in the company to teach and learn from each other, guaranteeing instruction and study, and regardless of the scorching heat, severe cold, wind, frost, rain, and snow, he climbed on the tanks to memorize the machine parts and study driving techniques. Within three months, all the soldiers in his company had generally mastered the complex tank combat technology, won the glorious title of National Training Excellent Company, and two model mutual assistance groups emerged, and twenty-one comrades were commended for their merits. He himself was also credited with second-class merit. Combat model Chi Shaohua reported how he, from an army scout with little literacy, had initially mastered the repair technology of aircraft through hard study. He said: "My cultural level is low and I lack scientific knowledge, so learning was really difficult at first. But I am a Communist Party member, I have perseverance. If others learn it once, I will learn it three or four times until I understand it. I finally, like other comrades, have initially mastered modern military technology." Liu Yurui, the company commander of a certain coastal defense unit, reported that the company he led had worked with fraternal units over the past year, regardless of day and night and without avoiding cold and heat, to build coastal defense works and learn various combat techniques, guarding the great motherland's coastal defense day and night. He said: "Every soldier in the company guarantees to me: 'Company commander, don't worry, if the enemy dares to invade, we will make sure they can't return.' Dear Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu! The soldiers' guarantee to me is also a guarantee to you." Combat hero Dai Xianyun reported that the battalion he led, together with fraternal units, overcame various difficulties and completely eliminated more than 1,000 bandits in the junction area of Gutian, Jian'ou, and Nanping counties in Fujian Province within three months.

The heroes and models also deeply reviewed the shortcomings that still existed in their thinking and work in their letters, and reported their future work plans and progress plans. They unanimously stated that they would not be arrogant or rash, and would continue to work hard to create more brilliant achievements in the future tasks of building a modern national defense army, defending the motherland, and defending Eastern and world peace, and lead out more new heroes and models.
