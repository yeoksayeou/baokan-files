  Heo Heon's Brief Biography
    On June 11, 1885, Heo Heon was born in a civil servant's family in Sangubok District, Myeongcheon County, Hamgyeongbuk-do, Korea. From his youth, he studied law and participated in the anti-Japanese national liberation movement very early on. After the March 1st Movement in 1919, the Japanese imperialists arrested and tried thirty-three patriotic figures. Heo Heon, as a lawyer, defended the thirty-three patriotic figures in the Japanese court, arguing that striving for national liberation was the legitimate right of the Korean people. In 1927, in the Japanese court's trial of one hundred and one Korean communists, he ruthlessly exposed the aggressive crimes of Japanese imperialism; in the same year, he organized the Singanhoe to unite the patriotic forces of the country for the anti-Japanese struggle, served as the chairman, and strengthened the Korean anti-Japanese national united front. In 1930, he was arrested by the Japanese imperialists for the Singanhoe incident and the Gwangju student incident and imprisoned for three years. After his release, he continued the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle despite all kinds of persecution by the Japanese imperialists, and was therefore imprisoned again. After the liberation of Korea on August 15, 1945, he organized and led the struggle against American imperialist colonial policies and the traitorous policies of the Syngman Rhee gang in South Korea. After the establishment of the South Korean Workers' Party, he served as the chairman, uniting all patriotic and democratic forces in South Korea, and stubbornly persisted in the struggle for the unification and independence of the motherland, regardless of the persecution by the American and Rhee gangs. After the national election in 1948, he was elected Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly. After the establishment of the Fatherland Unification Democratic Front, he was elected Chairman of the Presidium. In the same year, he was appointed President of Kim Il-sung University. In 1949, he was elected a member of the Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. Heo Heon held several important positions concurrently, and tirelessly struggled for the unification and independence of Korea. He made great contributions to the cultivation of national cadres and the development of national culture. In this just war against American aggression, he actively traveled to the front lines and various places in the rear, sparing no effort to fight, despite his old age and weak health, and finally gave his precious life.
