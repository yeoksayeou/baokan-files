　　The just verdict of the Beijing Military Control Commission's military court on the case of American government special agents and spies plotting armed rebellion has been warmly supported by people from all walks of life in Beijing. The broad masses of the people unanimously believe that this is a great victory for the Chinese people in combating imperialist conspiracies. Many factories held discussions on this matter. More than 800 workers at the Beijing Railway Bureau's rolling stock inspection section held group discussions on the 18th, expressing their heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the public security personnel. Workers from the Beijing Waterworks Company's East Water Plant, including Yu Xiang-sheng and 52 others, held a forum and said that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government can the destructive activities of imperialist special agents and spies be severely suppressed. Students from the Electric Power Bureau's electrician training class requested the government to commend the public security personnel who cracked the case. The workers were extremely resentful of the sinister conspiracies of the imperialist special agents and spies and, from this case, further recognized the hideous face of American imperialism. Workers at the People's Printing Factory were very angry when they saw the Tiananmen Square drawings surveyed by the spy Ryuichi Yamaguchi in the newspaper. Employees of the Beijing Post Office said: These spies wanted to harm our leaders; they deserve to be cut into a thousand pieces! Ma Lin-jun, a worker at the Beijing General Machinery Factory, also said that we should not only be vigilant ourselves but also regularly publicize the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to our relatives and neighbors.
　　The person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation issued a statement saying: "We women of Beijing raise both hands in support of the government's wise and correct measures." And expressed: "We, the million women of Beijing, must heighten our vigilance and assist the government in doing a good job in public security and defense work, so that these counter-revolutionary criminals have nowhere to hide. We must continue to carry out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and fight against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and defend our great motherland."
　　Teachers and students of various universities and colleges in the capital were extremely excited after learning the news of the execution of American special agents and spies, Anton Li and Ryuichi Yamaguchi. Zhang Jing-yue, Dean of Peking University, said: In the past, when imperialist elements committed crimes in China, the reactionary government's laws could not punish them. Now it's different; those who deserve the death penalty are sentenced to death. This is an encouragement and education to us, increasing our strength and confidence in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. On the afternoon of the 18th, the Tsinghua University Trade Union held a forum on this matter, attended by more than 40 professors. Everyone unanimously believed that the execution of American special agents and spies could only be done in the people's China. This is a concrete manifestation of the Chinese people standing up and another great victory for the Chinese people. Students throughout the school also conducted casual talks. Teachers and students from Normal University, Northern Jiaotong University, Beijing Railway College, North China University of Technology, Fu Jen Catholic University and other schools were filled with love for the government and hatred for the enemy in their talks about the execution of Anton Li and Ryuichi Yamaguchi. Students from the North China University of Technology said: Although special agents and spies are cunning, they will eventually escape the people's grasp. We cannot be paralyzed, and we must better assist the government in eliminating counter-revolutionary elements in the future. All the students of Beijing Municipal Fourth Middle School wrote a letter to Mayor Peng Zhen saying: We thank the Communist Party, we thank Chairman Mao, and we thank our People's Government.
　　The North Church District Catholic Renewal Committee of the Fifth District of Beijing, on behalf of more than 3,000 Catholics in the entire district, issued a statement supporting the government's correct measures in executing and sentencing American special agents and spies, and expressed its determination to sever ties with imperialism and eliminate imperialist elements in the church.
