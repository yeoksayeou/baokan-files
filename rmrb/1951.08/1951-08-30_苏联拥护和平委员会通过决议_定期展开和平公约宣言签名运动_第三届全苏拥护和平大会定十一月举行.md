Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 29th: The Soviet Peace Committee held a plenary session in Moscow on the 28th. Attending the meeting were prominent figures in science, art, and literature, Stakhanovite workers, collective farmers, social leaders, and religious representatives. After a heated discussion, the meeting unanimously decided to launch a signature campaign across the country in September for the declaration on a peace pact between the five major powers, and to hold the Third All-Soviet Peace Conference in November.

　　Soviet Peace Committee Vice-Chairman and renowned writer Ilya Ehrenburg delivered a report at the meeting, describing the situation of various countries supporting the World Peace Council's declaration. Ehrenburg suggested that the Soviet Peace Committee respond to the World Peace Council's declaration and called on all Soviet citizens to sign the declaration. He said: People all over the world know that the signatures of Soviet people carry a lot of weight, and their signature lists will make the instigators of a new war think twice. We must always remember Stalin's words: "If the people of all countries take on the cause of defending peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated." Ehrenburg said: We must join hands with peace-loving people all over the world to defend the cause of peace to the end, and we must force the war-mongers to retreat.

　　Ehrenburg's suggestion was warmly supported by all members of the Soviet Peace Committee.

　　Writer Mikhail Sholokhov said: Soviet workers are engaged in the greatest construction project in history for the benefit and happiness of the people. We have seen the severe suffering caused by war, and we have seen the blood of our relatives soak the soil of our motherland. We are gathered here today to sincerely call on the Soviet people and all upright people in the world to say to the war-mongers: "No war!" Sholokhov emphasized that the people of all countries are determined to stop the atrocities committed by the American and British aggressors against the unarmed women and children of Korea, and the barbarous bombing of cities and villages. All rational and upright people vehemently oppose the conspiracies of the enemies of mankind. The Soviet people demand the conclusion of a peace pact between the five major powers and wholeheartedly support the Soviet government's proposal, first put forward, on maintaining peace, ensuring international security, and concluding a peace pact.

　　Academician Bykov, a famous scientist, said: Soviet scientists serve the cause of peace, progress, and prosperity, so we firmly oppose war and fully support the proposal to launch a signature campaign for the World Peace Council's declaration throughout the country.

　　Sakha, a steelworker at the Magnitogorsk "Stalin" United Factory, emphasized: The Soviet people will sign the peace pact declaration as unanimously as they signed the Stockholm Appeal, and will strive to produce and support their signatures with practical actions.

　　Prokhorov, chairman of the "Red October" Collective Farm in Kirov Oblast, said: The farmers of our collective farm want me to speak on their behalf: We need lasting and solid peace, we resolutely demand peace from those who wield weapons, we demand an immediate end to the Korean War and demand that the American aggressors withdraw from Korea, and we demand the immediate conclusion of a peace pact between the five major powers.

　　Nikolai, Archbishop of Krutitsy and Kolomna, a member of the Soviet Peace Committee, renowned writer Konstantin Fedin, and Korabelnikova, a famous female worker at the Moscow "Paris Commune" factory, also delivered speeches at the meeting, unanimously supporting the conclusion of a peace pact between the five major powers.

　　The resolution unanimously adopted by the plenary session of the Soviet Peace Committee is as follows:

　　The plenary session of the Soviet Peace Committee unanimously supports the World Peace Council's declaration calling for a peace pact between the five major powers - the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union. This declaration expresses the will and desire of peace-loving people of all countries and has won the wholehearted approval of the Soviet people; the Soviet people care about solid and lasting peace and are prepared to defend the cause of just peace and international friendship to the end.

　　The constantly growing threat of another war has led increasingly large masses in all countries to rise up and resolutely fight to maintain peace. Nearly 450 million signatures have already been collected in countries around the world for the World Peace Council's declaration, which proves the indomitable will of the people of all countries to prevent war and maintain world peace.

　　The plenary session of the Soviet Peace Committee believes that it is necessary to start collecting signatures in the Soviet Union from September 1951 for the World Peace Council's declaration calling for a peace pact between the five major powers, and calls on all Soviet people to sign this declaration.

　　The Soviet Peace Committee is fully confident that all Soviet people will respond to this call and thereby demonstrate their willingness to spare no effort to defend the cause of peace and international security under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party; the Soviet people will once again express their boundless loyalty to Comrade Stalin - the greatest banner of peace.

　　All members of the plenary session of the Soviet Peace Committee signed the declaration on a peace pact between the five major powers.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 29th: All Moscow newspapers prominently published on the front page on the 29th the Soviet Peace Committee's resolution on launching a signature campaign for the declaration on a peace pact between the five major powers and holding the Third All-Soviet Peace Conference. The newspapers published the full text of the World Peace Council's declaration and published editorials unanimously supporting the launch of the signature campaign for the peace pact declaration.

　　苏联拥护和平委员会通过决议
    定期展开和平公约宣言签名运动
    第三届全苏拥护和平大会定十一月举行
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联拥护和平委员会于二十八日在莫斯科举行全体会议。参加会议的有著名的科学、艺术和文学工作者、斯塔哈诺夫式工人、集体农民、社会领袖和宗教代表。会议经热烈讨论后，一致决定：九月间在全国展开五大国缔结和平公约宣言的签名运动，并在十一月间举行第三届全苏拥护和平大会。
    苏联拥护和平委员会副主席、著名作家爱伦堡在会上作了报告，叙述世界各国拥护世界和平理事会宣言的情况。爱伦堡建议苏联拥护和平委员会响应世界和平理事会的宣言，并且号召苏联全体公民在宣言上签名。他说：全世界人民都知道，苏联人的签名有着很重的份量，他们的签名单会使新战争煽动者三思而后行。我们要经常记住斯大林的话：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”爱伦堡说：我们要和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，把和平事业保卫到底，我们要强迫战争贩子们退却。
    爱伦堡的建议获到了苏联拥护和平委员会全体委员的热烈拥护。
    作家萧洛霍夫说：苏联的工人们为了人民的利益和幸福，正在进行历史上最伟大的建设工程。我们曾经看到战争所造成的严重苦难，我们曾经看到亲人们的鲜血浸透了祖国的土地。我们今天聚集在这里，衷心地号召苏联人民和全世界正直人民对战争贩子说：“不许战争！”萧洛霍夫强调说：全世界各国人民都决心制止美英侵略者对朝鲜手无寸铁的妇女儿童所施的暴行，和对城市村庄的野蛮轰炸。一切有理性的正直的人们，都猛烈反对人类敌人的阴谋。苏联人民要求缔结五大国和平公约并且衷心拥护苏联政府首先提出的关于维护和平、确保国际安全和缔结和平公约的主张。
    著名科学家比科夫院士说：苏联科学家是服务于和平、进步和繁荣的事业的，因此，我们坚决地反对战争，完全拥护在全国开展世界和平理事会宣言签名运动的建议。
    马格尼托哥尔斯克“斯大林”联合工厂炼钢工人萨哈强调说：苏联人民将象在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名一样，一致在和平公约宣言上签名，并将努力生产，以实际行动来支持他们的签名。
    基洛夫州“红十月”集体农场主席普罗索罗夫说：我们集体农场的农民要我代表他们说话：我们需要持久和稳固的和平，我们坚决地向那些挥舞着武器的人们要求和平，我们要求立刻停止朝鲜战争并要求美国侵略者退出朝鲜，我们要求立即缔结五大国和平公约。
    苏联拥护和平委员会委员、克鲁提齐与科洛姆纳教区大主教尼古拉，著名作家费定，莫斯科“巴黎公社”工厂著名女工科拉贝尔尼科娃等人都在会上发表了演说，一致拥护五大国缔结和平公约。
    苏联拥护和平委员会全体会议一致通过的决议如下：
    苏联拥护和平委员会全体会议一致拥护世界和平理事会要求五大国——美国、英国、法国、中国、苏联——缔结和平公约的宣言。这个宣言表达了各国爱好和平人民的意志和愿望，获得了苏联人民全心全意的赞同；苏联人民关心稳固与持久的和平，并且准备维护正义的和平事业与国际友谊到底。
    另一次战争的威胁不断增长，这使一切国家日益广大的群众起来为维护和平而坚决斗争。在世界各国已经为世界和平理事会的宣言征集了近四亿五千万人的签名，这证明了各国人民有防止战争与维护世界和平事业的不屈不挠的意志。
    苏联拥护和平委员会全体会议认为必须自一九五一年九月开始在苏联为世界和平理事会要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言征集签名，并号召全体苏联人民在这个宣言上签名。
    苏联拥护和平委员会完全相信：全体苏联人民将响应这个号召，并从而证明他们愿意不遗余力地在列宁斯大林党的领导下保卫和平事业与国际安全；苏联人民将再度表示他们对斯大林同志——最伟大的和平旗手——有着无限的忠诚。
    苏联拥护和平委员会全体委员都在五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签了名。
