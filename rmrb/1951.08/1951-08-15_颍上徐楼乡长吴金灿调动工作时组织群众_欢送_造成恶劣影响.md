Wu Jincan, the head of Xulou Township in Nan Zhao District, Yingshang County, Northern Anhui, was recently transferred to a new job. When he left Xulou Township on the morning of July 17th, he actually "organized" more than two hundred people, a band, and a yangko dance team to "send him off" from the Xulou Township government to Dong Daodianzi in Gengpeng (a round trip of more than forty li). When Township Head Wu passed through Gengpeng Street, he was followed by militiamen with guns and a large crowd of well-wishers. Many people in Gengpeng Street reflected, "This township head is so 'powerful,' almost like a Kuomintang official!" Now is the busy farming season, and more than two hundred people could have hoed at least five hundred mu of soybeans in one day. Wu Jincan actually made the masses delay production to "see him off." This is an extreme lack of a mass perspective. Comrade Wu Jincan should seriously examine himself ideologically.

　　颍上徐楼乡长吴金灿调动工作时组织群众“欢送”造成恶劣影响
    皖北颍上县南照区徐楼乡乡长吴金灿同志最近调动工作。他在七月十七日上午离开徐楼乡时，竟“组织”二百多个群众和乐队、秧歌队等由徐楼乡政府“欢送”他到耿棚东导店孜（往返四十余里）。当吴乡长经过耿棚街时，后面跟着持枪护送的民兵和大队欢送群众。耿棚街很多群众反映：“这个乡长多‘威风’，和国民党的官差不多！”现在正是农忙的时候，二百余群众一天至少可锄五百亩黄豆，吴金灿竟让群众耽误生产来“欢送”他。这是极端缺乏群众观点的表现。吴金灿同志应该认真从思想上进行检讨。
