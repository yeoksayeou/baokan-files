    Suggestion to Create Literary Works Based on Historical Investigation Materials of Wu Xun

    To the Editors:

    The "Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" published in the People's Daily over the past few days has completely resolved the various erroneous understandings that many of us previously had due to being misled by the spirit of Wu Xun. It is more convincing and more problem-solving than many articles published in the past, which is very satisfying.

    Now we have the following request: we hope to re-film a movie based on this investigation, with the peasant revolution of that time as the theme. The reason is that many working people who have watched the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" have been more or less negatively influenced. Although the investigation has been published in the newspaper today, working people may not necessarily understand it. Therefore, we put forward this suggestion.

    In addition, we suggest that the People's Publishing House quickly compile popular comic books based on the investigation to help the broad masses of people understand the historical truth of Wu Xun and eliminate the confused thoughts left in people's minds by all erroneous works of "The Life of Wu Xun."

                                                Li Weiqing Yang Sijin

    To the Editors:

    I was very happy to read the "Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" in the newspaper recently. This article exposed the true face of Wu Xun and educated some people with erroneous thoughts. Personnel from schools, organizations, and groups across the country have launched discussions on "The Life of Wu Xun," initially clarifying some incorrect understandings. However, many people who have seen the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" may not have participated in in-depth discussions, and their minds still have some incorrect ideas and confused notions more or less. I suggest that the literary and art circles use these investigation materials to create dramas, novels, poems, and comic books based on the historical background and characters of the time to educate everyone.

    To the Editors:

    The publication of the "Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" meets the urgent needs of the current society. It not only solves everyone's ideological problems but also points out the correct direction for literary writers to portray historical figures. I believe that literary and art workers will adopt this valuable material and compile it into dramas, novels, and comic strips. I hope that relevant agencies and organizations will conduct this work in a planned and guided manner.

### 建议根据武训历史调查材料编写文艺作品

专栏：读者来信

    建议根据武训历史调查材料编写文艺作品编辑同志：
    人民日报连日发表的“武训历史调查记”，完全解决了我们许多人过去被武训精神所迷惑而产生的种种错误认识，它比起过去发表的许多文章更有说服力，更能解决问题，很令人满意。
    现在我们有这样一个要求：希望根据这个调查记重新拍摄一部以当时的农民革命为题材的电影。理由是过去有许多劳动人民看了“武训传”电影以后，或多或少受到一些坏影响，今天报上虽然发表了调查记，但劳动人民不一定看得懂，因此，我们提出了这个建议。
    另外，我们建议人民出版社赶快根据调查记编制通俗的连环图画，帮助广大的人民了解武训的历史真相，扫清“武训传”一切错误著作留给人们的混乱思想。
                                                李唯清  杨思进编辑同志：
    最近我从报上读到了“武训历史调查记”，很是高兴。这篇文章揭穿了武训的真面目，教育了某些存在着错误思想的人们。全国各学校、机关、团体的人员曾经展开过对“武训传”的讨论，初步地澄清了某些不正确的认识。可是，曾经看过“武训传”电影的人，恐怕有许多人并没有参加深入的讨论，他们的思想中或多或少的还存在着某些不正确的想法和糊涂观念。我建议文艺界利用这些调查的材料，创作以当时历史背景和人物为题材的戏剧、小说、诗歌、连环图画，以教育大家。
                                         唐山人民检察署  卞中编辑同志：
    “武训历史调查记”的发表，是合乎当前社会的迫切需要的，它不仅解决了大家的思想问题，而且给文艺作家们指出了描写历史人物的正确方向。我相信文艺工作者会采用这个宝贵的素材，编成戏剧、小说和连环画。我希望有关机关团体有计划有领导地进行这个工作。
