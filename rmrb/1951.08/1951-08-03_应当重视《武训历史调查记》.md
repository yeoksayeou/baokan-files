　　Should Attach Importance to "The Investigation of Wu Xun's History"
    Editor:
    The "Investigation of Wu Xun's History" continuously published by the People's Daily since July 23rd has enabled us to have a deeper understanding of Wu Xun, who is "unworthy of emulation," and is of great help in clarifying confused ideas. Many comrades in our organization are very actively studying this document. However, some comrades still do not pay enough attention to it. They think this is "splitting hairs," "wasting space," "why make such a big fuss about a Wu Xun?" "Even a photo of the gate of a landlord's house that Wu Xun often went to is published, what's the point of that!"
    I think this view is incorrect. As the People's Daily editorial pointed out on May 20th: The criticism of Wu Xun and "The Story of Wu Xun" is a fundamental ideological issue. Everyone can improve their ideological level from this discussion.
    Therefore, I think everyone should continue to study "The Investigation of Wu Xun's History" in depth and correctly understand the reactionary essence of Wu Xun.

### 应当重视《武训历史调查记》

　　应当重视《武训历史调查记》
    编辑同志：
    人民日报自七月二十三日以来连续发表的《武训历史调查记》使我们对“不足为训”的武训，有了更深刻的认识，对于澄清混乱思想帮助很大。我们机关内的许多同志，大都非常积极地钻研学习这个文件。但也有部分同志，对此还不够重视。他们认为这是“钻牛角尖”，“浪费篇幅”，“对于一个武训还要这样大张旗鼓来搞吗？”“连武训常去的一个地主家的大门的照片，都刊登出来，这有什么意思！”
    我认为这种看法是不对的。正如五月二十日人民日报社论指出：对武训和《武训传》的批判，是一个带有根本性质的思想问题。大家都可以从这次讨论中，提高自己的思想水平。
    因此，我认为大家都应该继续深入学习《武训历史调查记》，正确地认识武训的反动本质。
