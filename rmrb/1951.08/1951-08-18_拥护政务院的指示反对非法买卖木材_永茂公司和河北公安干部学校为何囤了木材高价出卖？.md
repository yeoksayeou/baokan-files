    Supporting the State Council's Directive Against Illegal Timber Trading:
    Why Did Yongmao Company and Hebei Public Security Cadre School Hoard Timber and Sell it at High Prices?

To the Editor:

    I am a worker in a construction company and strongly support the State Council's "Directive on Saving Timber." I believe this directive is very timely. This year, the phenomenon of state-owned enterprises, government agencies, and schools illegally buying and selling timber to extract high profits is indeed very serious. For example, the Beijing branch of the China Construction Company urgently needed timber due to numerous projects. In order to complete its tasks, it bought two thousand cubic meters of timber from Yongmao Company on July 20th. Grade A timber cost 2.2 million yuan per cubic meter, and even Grade C timber cost 780,000 yuan.

    The Beijing branch of the China Construction Company also bought 291 cubic meters of timber, six to eight meters long, from the Hebei Public Security Cadre School, at a price of 2.85 million yuan per cubic meter (this timber is currently at the New Beijing Sawmill).

    It is understood that the above two units are not legally designated departments for managing building materials, yet they have so much timber to sell. However, the China Equipment Company, which supplies building materials, has no timber available.

    Timber prices have been pushed too high by those illegally trading timber, which greatly affects construction costs. I hope that the Construction Steering Committee and other relevant authorities will promptly conduct a thorough investigation and handle this issue.

                                                    Dong Wenxing

    拥护政务院的指示反对非法买卖木材
    永茂公司和河北公安干部学校为何囤了木材高价出卖？编辑同志：
    我是建筑公司的一个工作者，对政务院颁布的《关于节约木材的指示》非常拥护，我认为这个指示是很切合时宜的。今年公营企业、机关、学校非法买卖木材攫取高额利润的现象的确很严重。例如：中国建筑公司北京分公司因为工程多，急需木料。为了完成任务，曾于七月二十日向永茂公司买到二千立方公尺木料，甲种木料每立方公尺价达二百二十万元，丙等的还七十八万元。
    中国建筑公司北京分公司还曾向河北公安干部学校买到六公尺到八公尺长的木材二百九十一立方公尺，每立方公尺价达二百八十五万元（该项木料现在还在新北京电锯厂）。
    据了解，上述两单位并不是法定的经营建筑器材的部门，却存有这么多木料出卖。但是供应建筑器材的中国器材公司反倒没有木料。
    木材价格被非法买卖木材者提得太高了，这影响建筑成本很大，希望建筑指导委员会和其他有关机关迅速彻查处理这个问题。
