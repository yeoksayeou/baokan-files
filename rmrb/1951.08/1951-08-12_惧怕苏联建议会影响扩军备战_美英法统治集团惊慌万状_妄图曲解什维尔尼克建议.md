　　Fearing Soviet Proposals Would Affect Arms Expansion and War Preparations
    US, British, and French Ruling Groups Panic, Attempting to Distort Shvernik's Suggestions
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 11th] Shvernik's letter to Truman and the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR have greatly alarmed the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France. They are doing everything possible to minimize the international significance of this matter and deliberately distort the truth, resorting once again to their old tune of accusing these two documents of being "Communist propaganda."

    According to TASS: To counter Shvernik's reply to Truman, the U.S. State Department issued a lengthy official statement to the press on August 7th, attempting to distort the motives behind the Soviet proposals. The State Department's statement rejected the proposal to conclude a five-power peace pact with clumsy excuses, saying that with the United Nations and its Charter in existence, concluding such a pact is superfluous.

    The U.S. State Department's statement and the American press have carefully avoided expressing opinions on the main points of Shvernik's reply and the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. They did not answer the question of what "peace-loving motives" the U.S. government has been using to consistently reject the Soviet government's proposal to conclude a five-power peace pact. They also remained silent on the facts listed in the Soviet resolution regarding American discrimination against the Soviet Union, and on the fact that some of these discriminatory measures were implemented after the U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution of both houses. They also remained silent on the undeniable evidence stated in the Soviet resolution that it is precisely "the American authorities who have adopted discriminatory policies towards the Soviet Union, erecting artificial barriers to prevent free communication between the Soviet Union and the American people, isolating our two countries from each other."

    At the same time, the American newspapers close to the American ruling groups could not conceal their alarm caused by the publication of Shvernik's reply and the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The American ruling groups believe that these two documents are a "peace offensive" that will harm the wealthy tycoons who are enriching themselves through the arms expansion movement. The *Wall Street Journal* stated very frankly that the initial reaction of U.S. officials to Shvernik's reply and the Soviet Supreme Soviet resolution was that they must be rejected immediately. The newspaper said that there is no doubt that the Soviet Union's expression this time is part of Washington's so-called new "peace offensive." The success of this "peace offensive" would relax America's war preparations, thereby reducing the profits of the war industry.

    *The New York Times* also unintentionally revealed why the American ruling groups oppose the conclusion of a peace pact. The newspaper wrote that the peace pact "would tie the hands and feet of Western countries" and would "hinder their obligation and desire to use force to suppress acts of aggression." In other words, a peace pact would hinder American imperialists from arming and launching aggression.

    A spokesman for the British Foreign Office issued a hostile statement at a press conference regarding the two important Soviet peace documents.

    The British bourgeois newspapers did not allow the British people to fully know about Shvernik's reply to Truman and the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Only *The Manchester Guardian* published the full text of the two documents. Most bourgeois newspapers focused on reporting the statement of the U.S. State Department spokesman rejecting the Soviet proposal to conclude a five-power peace pact. Reuters commentator Matthews Stanwhite admitted that the British ruling group was alarmed by the Soviet Union's "peace offensive." Matthews said that the West will not be in a hurry to accept the Soviet Union's recent proposal to convene a five-power conference to discuss world peace. *The Times* expressed the concerns of British officials, who worry that Shvernik's reply will receive widespread support from the British people and others in Western Europe. The newspaper said: "Western countries must learn a lesson about their actions. Many people in many countries are almost hopelessly looking for a way out of the endless deadlock, and they quickly think that such a proposal (such as a five-power peace pact) is such a way out."

    Following the example of the United States and Britain, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a similar statement on Shvernik's letter. The French semi-official *Le Monde* published a commentary saying that it is impossible to conclude a five-power peace pact because there are still differences between the Soviet Union and Western countries. In addition to *Le Monde*, other newspapers of the reactionary camp, such as *Paris Presse*, *Radical*, *Franc-Tireur*, *Le Peuple*, and *Le Figaro*, all echoed the U.S. State Department's statement in unison.

　　惧怕苏联建议会影响扩军备战
    美英法统治集团惊慌万状  妄图曲解什维尔尼克建议
    【新华社十一日讯】什维尔尼克致杜鲁门的信和苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议，使美英法三国的统治集团甚为慌张，他们竭力设法缩小此事的国际意义，并故意歪曲真相，再度求助于他们的老调，诬指这两个文件是“共产党宣传”。
    据塔斯社消息：美国国务院为了对付什维尔尼克致杜鲁门的复信，特于八月七日向报界发表了冗长的正式声明，企图曲解苏联建议的动机。国务院的声明以笨拙的借口拒绝缔结五大国和平公约的建议，它说：既有联合国及其宪章存在，缔结这种公约是多余的。
    美国国务院的声明和美国各报，都小心地避免对什维尔尼克的复信和最高苏维埃主席团的决议的主旨表示意见。它们对于美国政府根据什么“爱好和平的动机”一直拒绝苏联政府提出的关于缔结五大国和平公约的建议的问题，没有答复。对于苏联决议所列举的关于美国歧视苏联的一些事实，以及对于若干这种歧视措施是在美国国会通过了参众两院共同决议后施行的这一事实，也保持缄默。对于苏联决议中所说的恰恰正是“美国权力机关对苏联采取了歧视政策，并树立人为的障壁，阻止苏联与美国人民自由交际，把我们两国隔离开来”的这样无容置辩的证据，它们也保持缄默。
    同时，接近美国统治集团的美国报纸掩盖不住由于发表了什维尔尼克的复信和苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议所引起的惊惶。美国统治集团认为这两个文件，是一个会损害那些正在靠扩张军备运动来肥己的豪门巨富的“和平攻势”。《华尔街日报》很直率的说：美国官方对什维尔尼克的复信和最高苏维埃的决议的最初反应是：必须立即予以拒绝。该报说，毫无疑问，苏联这次的表示，是华盛顿所说的新的“和平攻势”的一部分。这个“和平攻势”的成功，会使美国的战争准备松弛，从而减少战争工业的利润。
    《纽约时报》也违反本意地暴露了美国统治集团为什么反对缔结和平公约的理由。该报写道，和平公约“将把西方国家的手脚束缚起来”，会“阻碍他们使用武力镇压侵略行为的义务与心愿。”换句话说，就是和平公约将妨碍美国帝国主义者进行武装与发动侵略。
    英国外交部的发言人在记者招待会上就苏联这两个重要和平文件发表了敌视性的声明。
    英国的资产阶级报纸不让英国人民充分知道什维尔尼克致杜鲁门的复信和苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议。只有《曼彻斯特卫报》刊载了两个文件的全文。大多数资产阶级报纸都集中篇幅报道美国国务院发言人拒绝苏联提出的缔结五大国和平公约的建议的声明。路透社评论员马休斯坦白承认，英国统治集团因苏联的“和平攻势”而感到惊恐。马休斯说，西方将不急于接受苏联最近提出的召开五大国会议讨论世界和平的建议。《泰晤士报》表达了英国官方人士的忧虑，他们忧虑什维尔尼克的复信会得到英国人民和西欧其他人士的普遍支持。该报说：“西方国家必须吸取关于他们的行动的教训。许多国家的许多人民几乎无望地在寻找脱离无穷尽的僵局的出路，他们很快地就想到，这种建议（如五大国和平公约）就是这样的出路。”
    学着美国和英国的榜样，法国外交部发言人就什维尔尼克的信发表了类似的声明。法国半官方的《世界报》发表评论说，缔结五大国和平公约是不可能的，因为苏联和西方国家之间还存在着分歧。除了《世界报》之外，其他反动阵营的报纸，如《巴黎新闻》、《急进报》、《义勇军报》、《人民报》和《费加罗报》等都众口同声地附和美国国务院的声明。
