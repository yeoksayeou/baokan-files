As pointed out in the "Notice on Implementing the Production Increase Donation Plan and Paying Donations on Schedule" issued by this newspaper on the 21st, the national people's patriotic donation movement has achieved great success. The main tasks at present are to conscientiously implement the production increase donation plan, pay donations on schedule, and overcome the shortcomings and biases that have already occurred in the movement, so as to consolidate and expand the achievements already made. Generally speaking, the leading organs in most parts of the country have grasped the leadership of this donation movement tightly, and the development of the movement is generally sound. However, there are also some places where the movement is lagging behind, and a few places have some shortcomings and biases, which must be overcome. This article specifically discusses the coercive tendencies that have occurred in individual places, hoping to arouse widespread attention in various places.

According to a report in the New Hunan Daily on August 20, serious coercive phenomena exist in the donation movement in some villages in Hunan. Some village cadres do not use ideological education and organizational methods to mobilize the masses, but use challenge assignments to pursue figures. The letters of challenge are drafted by a few cadres or the township government, stating that each person guarantees to donate a certain amount of money, and each village then assigns it to the masses accordingly. Some districts and villages assign donations based on an average per mu of land, stipulating that the masses must pledge to increase production by 20 catties per mu of paddy field and 2 catties per mu of cotton field. Some districts stipulate that each person "must donate at least five dou of grain." Some cadres even put pressure on the masses who have not yet pledged to donate by saying they "do not love the motherland." These erroneous practices exist to varying degrees not only in Hunan Province but also in some places in other provinces and regions.

The reason for the occurrence of coercive phenomena is that, on the one hand, some lower-level work cadres have long had a coercive working style and do not understand or are not good at using propaganda and education methods to enlighten the masses to promote work; and the more important reason is that the leading organs in some places, especially the leading organs in some cities, counties, and districts, do not understand that the key to carrying out the donation movement is to do a good job in propaganda and education and to do a good job in organizing increased production. They are satisfied with "many instructions have been issued" and "experiences are introduced in the newspaper every day," mistakenly believing that the patriotic donation movement "has no problems," so they do not seriously educate village cadres, organize cadres to study hard, so as to understand the significance of the donation movement, and learn to use propaganda and education methods to enlighten the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, and guide this enthusiasm to increase production and increase income. On the contrary, some county and district leading organs themselves treat and deploy the donation movement as grain collection and tax collection work, or allow village cadres to blindly pursue donation figures regardless of the actual situation, and even some district-level leading organs directly preside over such challenges.

The higher-level leading organs in the relevant areas have already paid attention to the above-mentioned tendency of forced assignment, and some have taken resolute steps to correct it. According to the current materials, this tendency is only an isolated phenomenon, but it must be resolutely corrected and prevented, otherwise it will not achieve the entire purpose of supporting the front, consolidating national defense, educating the masses, and promoting national construction, but will cause difficulties for the people and even give counter-revolutionaries the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, causing us political losses.

The key to overcoming coercion in the donation movement is to systematically and from top to bottom do a good job in propaganda and education, and first of all, do a good job in educating work cadres and activists. To this end, leading organs in various places should send people to go deep into the lower levels to conduct an inspection to see if there is any coercion, so as to correct it in time. Those who have not yet discovered this tendency should also pay attention to prevention. Of course, opposing forced assignments or disguised forced assignments does not mean relaxing the leadership and promotion of the work of increasing production and donation and letting the movement take its own course; on the contrary, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the movement, and the most important thing is to strengthen the patriotic propaganda and education work for the people and the propaganda and education work for increasing production and donation, so as to achieve the expected goals of this patriotic donation movement.

### 巩固捐献运动的成绩，克服运动中的强迫命令偏向

　　巩固捐献运动的成绩，克服运动中的强迫命令偏向
    正如本会二十一日“关于执行增产捐献计划、按期缴纳捐款的通知”中所指出：全国人民的爱国捐献运动已经获得伟大的成绩，目前的主要任务就是要认真执行增产捐献计划、按期缴纳捐款，并克服运动中所已经发生的缺点和偏向，借以巩固和扩大已经取得的成绩。一般说，全国大部分地方的领导机关对于这次捐献运动的领导是抓得紧的，运动的发展一般是健全的。但是也有一些地方，存在着运动的落后状况，并有少数地方，发生了一些缺点和偏向，这是必须加以克服的。本文特别谈一下已经在个别地方发生了的强迫命令偏向，希望引起各地普遍注意。
    据新湖南报八月二十日报道：湖南若干乡村的捐献运动，存在着严重的强迫命令现象，有些乡村干部不用进行思想教育和组织增产的方法来发动群众，却用挑战摊派的方法来追求数字。而挑战书又是由少数干部或乡政府拟定的，写明每人保证捐款若干，各村便据此向群众摊派。有的区村则按地亩平均摊派，规定群众须按稻田每亩增产二十斤，棉田每亩增产二斤认捐。有的区规定每人“起码捐五斗谷”。有的干部甚至以“不爱祖国”来对尚未认捐的群众实施压力。这些错误的作法，不仅在湖南省，在其他省区的若干地方也是程度不同地存在着。
    发生强迫命令现象的原因，一方面是由于若干下层工作干部长期存在着强迫命令作风，不懂得或不善于用宣传教育、启发群众自觉的方法来推动工作；而更主要的原因是有些地方的领导机关，特别是有些市、县、区的领导机关不了解开展捐献运动的关键是做好宣传教育工作，做好增产的组织工作。他们满足于“指示已经发了不少”，“报上天天介绍经验”，错误地认为爱国捐献运动“已经没有什么问题了”，因而不去认真教育乡村干部，组织干部好好学习，以便认识捐献运动的意义，并学会用宣传教育的方法来启发群众的爱国热情，并将这种热情引向增加生产、增加收入的方向上去。相反地，甚至有些县、区领导机关本身就把捐献运动当作是收粮、收税工作来看待、布置，或者听任乡村干部不顾实际情况地进行单纯追求捐献数字的盲目挑战，甚至有某些区级领导机关，竟直接主持这种挑战。
    上述强迫摊派的偏向，现在各有关地区的上级领导机关都已经加以注意，有的并已采取坚决步骤加以纠正。根据现在的材料来看，这种偏向只是个别的现象，但无疑是必须坚决纠正和防止的，否则就不能达到支援前线、巩固国防、教育群众和推动国家建设的全部目的，反而造成人民群众的困难，甚至给予反革命分子以造谣破坏的机会，使我们在政治上遭受损失。
    克服捐献运动中的强迫命令的关键，是有系统地、由上而下地做好宣传教育工作，首先要做好对工作干部和积极分子的教育工作。为此，各地领导机关都应该派人深入下层作一次检查，看看有没有强迫命令的现象，以便及时地加以纠正。尚未发现这种偏向的，也应注意预防。当然，反对强迫摊派或变相强迫摊派，并不是放松增产捐献工作的领导与推动工作，听任运动的自流；相反地，必须加强对运动的领导，最主要的是要加强对人民群众的爱国主义的宣传教育工作和增产捐献的宣传教育工作，这样才能达到这次爱国捐献运动的预期目的。
