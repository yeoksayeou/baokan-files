　　Critique of Speculative Publications from Speculative Publishers
　　Long Gong

　　Currently, there are some speculative publishers and also some muddle-headed "authors," and therefore, there are also many speculative and muddle-headed "works" being published. If you ask what abilities these publishers and "authors" possess, it's difficult to answer. It seems that copying and pasting is their only skill—unfortunately, they don't even copy well, and they paste haphazardly. These "works" often claim to be "Marxist-Leninist"—why claim to be Marxist-Leninist? Probably to deliberately mess up Marxism-Leninism!

　　The "Elementary Course in Social Science," published by Xinchao Bookstore in July this year, is such a ridiculous "work." To criticize the theoretical errors of such a work is superfluous. Let's just give a few examples to see its level of common sense:

　　"Marx divided the development of capitalism into two stages, the socialist stage and the communist stage." (Page 101) "The 'democratic countries' that are both bourgeois dictatorships, such as Britain and the United States, the United States and France, Britain, the United States, and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe like Poland and Czechoslovakia, also have essential differences." (Page 76)

　　What kind of "work" is this! A "course" of over a hundred thousand words cannot clarify issues that even primary school students can understand. Isn't this too absurd?

　　"This kind of dictatorship (referring to the people's democratic dictatorship of New Democracy) is to deal with the exploiting classes who do not work for a living." (Page 93) Rich peasants "exploit the surplus value created by hired laborers. Therefore, rich peasants also carry feudal exploitation." (Page 38) Clearly, this author does not understand what is meant by exploitation or feudal exploitation.

　　"Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the dual nature and two-faced policy of the Chinese bourgeoisie, and the characteristic of Chinese society being small at both ends and large in the middle, thus determining the position of the middle forces." (Page 44) Perhaps the author is also unclear about how many people there are in China; otherwise, why would they see the bourgeoisie, which accounts for a small portion of the population, as the "large middle"?

　　"Chairman Mao put forward the correct strategic policy of using the weak to defeat the strong, turning passivity into initiative, using dispersion against concentration, and using the countryside against the cities (encircling the cities from the countryside)." (Page 115) From what kind of military book did the author derive this strange conclusion? What kind of strategic policy is "turning passivity into initiative"? The statement "using dispersion against concentration" is also one-sided. This is again the author copying incompletely!

　　"He (referring to Chairman Mao) said to those impatient advocates of the withering away of the state: 'Don't you want to eliminate state power?'..." (Page 103) Here the book is copied backward; it copied the meaning of people asking Chairman Mao into Chairman Mao asking people.

　　There is such a sentence: "The metal tool era transitioned from the stone age to the metal tool era." (Page 12) How strange it is that such incomprehensible text appears in a work called a "course"!

　　"The Republic of China in name and in fact" (Page 91, sub-heading) – So it turns out that we are still the "Republic of China," isn't this utterly absurd?

　　We should issue a serious warning to such "authors" and "publishers": Please do not wildly distort social science and national policy and unscrupulously deceive readers for the sake of meager royalties and profits!

　　Editor's note: Xinchao Bookstore, located at No. 107 Wangfujing Street, Beijing, is a typical speculative publishing institution. Many of the books it publishes are hastily pieced together. For example, "History of the French Imperialist Invasion of China" written by Ling Dating and published by the bookstore in May is the work of an ignorant copier. The materials collected in "History of the New Democratic Revolution (Learning Materials)" edited by Wei Can and published in July are almost 90% copied from the "Reference Materials on the History of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution" published by the Commercial Press in early April of this year. It is essentially the same book published twice. Publishing administrative agencies should intervene in such publishers who only know how to seek profit and harm readers, and legitimate publishers should be ashamed to associate with them.

　　评投机出版商的投机出版物
    龙恭
    现在有个别投机出版商，也有一些糊涂“著作人”，因此，就还有不少投机、糊涂“著作物”出版。要问这些出版商和“著作人”有什么本领，那是很难回答出来的。似乎抄抄剪剪是他们唯一的本领——可惜，连抄也抄得不妙，剪也剪得凌乱。这些“著作”常常号称“马列主义”的——为什么要号称马列主义呢？大概是决心要把马列主义搅得乱七八糟吧！
    新潮书店在今年七月出版的“社会科学初级教程”就是这样一本可笑的“著作”。要批评这样的著作的理论错误，那是多余的事。我们且举几个例，看它的常识程度如何吧：
    “马克思把资本主义的发展分成二个阶段，社会主义阶段及共产主义阶段。”（一○一页）“同是资产阶级专政的‘民主国家’，英国和美国，美国和法国，英、美和现在东欧的新民主主义波兰、捷克等国，也有本质上的差别。”（七六页）
    这是什么“著作”啊！一本洋洋十几万字的“教程”弄不清小学生也能弄得清的问题，这不是太过于荒谬的事情吗？
    “这种独裁专政（按指新民主主义的人民民主专政）是对付不劳而获的剥削阶级。”（九三页）富农“剥削雇工所创造的剩余价值。所以富农也带有封建剥削。”（三八页）显然，这位作者是不懂得什么叫做剥削或封建剥削的。
    “毛泽东同志指出中国资产阶级的两重性和他的两面政策，中国社会两头小中间大的特点，确定了中间势力的地位。”（四四页）大约作者对于中国有多少人口也是不清楚的，不然，为什么把占人口少数的资产阶级看成了“中间大”呢？
    “毛主席提出了以弱敌强，以被动对主动，以分散对集中，以农村对城市（农村包围城市）的正确的战略方针。”（一一五页）作者是从那一种军事书中得出这种奇怪的结论来的？“以被动对主动”这是什么战略方针呢？“以分散对集中”的说法也是片面的，这又是作者抄书抄得不完全的！
    “他（按指毛主席）对那些急性的国家消灭论者说道：‘你们不是要消灭国家权力吗？’……”（一○三页）这里是把书抄反了，它把人家问毛主席的语意抄成毛主席问人家的语意了。
    有这样的一句话：“金属工具时代由石器过渡到金属工具时代。”（十二页）这种不通的文字出现在一本称为“教程”的著作中，是多么奇怪的事！
    “名符其实的中华民国”（九一页小标题）——原来我们现在竟还是“中华民国”，这不是荒谬透顶了吗？
    我们应该向这样的“著作家”和“出版家”提出郑重的警告：请不要为了区区的稿费和利润而狂妄地歪曲社会科学和国家政策，而肆无忌惮地欺骗读者！
    编者按：新潮书店开设在北京王府井大街一○七号，是一个典型的投机出版机构，所出的书很多是草率拼凑而成的。例如该店五月出版、凌大挺著的“法帝侵华史”就是一本无知的抄书匠的作品；七月出版、维灿编的“新民主主义革命的历史（学习资料）”所收集的材料，差不多有百分之九十以上都是转抄商务印书馆本年四月初版的“中国新民主主义革命史参考资料”，实际上是一书两印。对于这样只知牟利、贻害读者的出版商，出版行政机构应该加以干涉，正当的出版家应该耻与为伍。
