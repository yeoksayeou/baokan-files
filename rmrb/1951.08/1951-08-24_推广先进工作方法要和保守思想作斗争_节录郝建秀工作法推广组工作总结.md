The Promotion of Advanced Working Methods Must Struggle Against Conservative Thinking
    ——Excerpts from the Work Summary of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method Promotion Group

In order to enable the majority of fine yarn workers to master the Hao Jianxiu work method and transform advanced experience into the wealth of the masses, the Qingdao Textile Union and the Textile Management Branch organized the Hao Jianxiu Work Method Promotion Group to carry out promotion work in various factories. As of now, all fine yarn operators in Qingdao have basically learned the Hao Jianxiu work method, and have achieved the following results:

    (1) The rate of roller lapping has been reduced. Calculated by factory, it has generally been reduced by about 30% to 51%.

    (2) An unprecedented technical learning upsurge has been created among Qingdao textile workers. The Hao Jianxiu work method is not only being learned by fine yarn workers, but has now been extended to every production department in the textile factory.

    (3) Because Comrade Hao Jianxiu is good at humbly learning from others' experiences, the Hao Jianxiu work method has been developed through this promotion work, such as absorbing the roving piecing method and the non-spindle tube piecing method from Factory No. 1.

In short, the development of this movement has comprehensively advanced the fine yarn work in Qingdao and yielded a relatively complete fine yarn operation method.

  The Ideological Struggle Between the New and the Old

The promotion work did not proceed smoothly; the promotion process was an ideological struggle between the new and the old. In the early stage of promotion, the following three main incorrect ideological understandings arose among the workers:

    The first type of person had excessively high expectations of Hao Jianxiu, believing that Hao Jianxiu's operation method must be outstanding in every aspect, a legendary figure who was diligent and quick. After watching Hao Jianxiu's performance, they felt disappointed because the movements were not surprising. How could it reduce roller lapping? They believed that only a good machine and easy work could reduce roller lapping, and human effort was useless.

    The second type of person believed that the Hao Jianxiu work method was still just about "three diligences and three quicks," simply adding more effort; and seeing that Hao Jianxiu combined several tasks, they thought that only young people could learn such intensive work. "I am old, I can't run fast, I can't learn."

    The third type of person was self-important old technical workers with conservatism. They started making noise as soon as they watched Hao Jianxiu's performance, specifically looking for shortcomings, such as lumps in the piecing and broken ends. They also shouted, "Still need her to teach us? My seniority is greater than her age, and I can do better than her even using my toes."

Among the cadres, some said that Hao Jianxiu was only good at allocating time, and other movements were exaggerated in the summary. Some people worried that the Hao Jianxiu work method would not work in factories with poor conditions and many breaks; it would work on warp yarn frames but not on weft yarn frames, etc.

After understanding the above ideological situations, various methods were used to clear these ideological obstacles and dispel these ideological concerns. Individual talks were conducted with those who were unconvinced, and meetings were also convened to call on people to voluntarily participate in learning, and it was pointed out that a humble attitude was necessary to experience the benefits of the Hao Jianxiu work method. In this way, the confrontational thinking was basically eliminated. In addition, the method of apprenticeship was used to ask Hao Jianxiu to learn humbly. For example, Tan Yufang, an old worker at the State-owned Qingdao No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, was unconvinced at first, saying that Hao Jianxiu's piecing was large and had feathered yarn. Hao Jianxiu went to learn from her. Tan Yufang was moved to see that Hao Jianxiu was learning so humbly, and she also humbly learned from Hao Jianxiu. At the next discussion meeting, she spoke about the advantages of the Hao Jianxiu work method and said what was in her heart: "I ran uselessly for more than 20 years. It's much better after learning the Hao Jianxiu work method, and the work is much easier than before." Because of the learning experiences of these old workers, others were more confident in learning. The other ideological situations were also dispelled by facts. Because whoever learned the Hao Jianxiu work method would reduce roller lapping, and the factories with more roller lapping reduced the most; for example, Factory No. 5 used to produce five or six pounds of roller lapping, but now it only produces about one pound. Not only was roller lapping reduced, but labor was also reduced; for example, after the apprentice workers of the State-owned Qingdao No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory learned the method, they generally asked to look after more spindles. Zhang Yuanfeng used to look after 300 spindles, but now she looks after 420 spindles, and the roller lapping is still less than one pound. Facts speak louder than words, and the masses have experienced the superiority of the Hao Jianxiu work method in practice.

  Consolidate Achievements and Move Forward Continuously!

The Hao Jianxiu work method has been promoted rapidly in various cotton textile factories in Qingdao, and the results have also been very great. Now all aspects have attached importance to this issue, which is very good. However, some people are worried that promotion is easy but consolidation is difficult, which is indeed worth noting. In order to consolidate and achieve further development, the following points must be paid attention to:

    (1) The promotion should be in-depth and specific, because after truly understanding the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu work method and being able to master and apply it, not only is roller lapping reduced, but also the labor intensity is reduced, which is also beneficial to oneself. How can it not be implemented? The reason for not being able to consolidate is that the benefits of the Hao Jianxiu work method have not been realized. Therefore, in the promotion process, it must be in-depth and specific, and all formalism and task viewpoints must be opposed. According to the results of the inspections by various factories, some factories have not promoted it in depth, so some workers have only learned Hao Jianxiu's "take the board never leave the hand" and patrolling, which is not enough.

    (2) Whether it can be consolidated depends on whether the leading cadres continue to pay attention to it. Do not regard learning the Hao Jianxiu work method as a simple task, that it is over after learning it. A system should be established for regular inspections.

    (3) Dropping old baggage and mutual distrust, removing pride and the "only praise, no criticism" style, these thoughts are all obstacles to progress. Comrade Hao Jianxiu never rests on her laurels, and is willing to humbly learn from others, concentrating every bit of good experience into her own work method, such as learning the non-spindle tube piecing method and the roving piecing method in Factory No. 1. Therefore, the Hao Jianxiu work method is a focal point of various creations. We should learn from this spirit of Hao Jianxiu, so that the work will not remain at the original level.

　　推广先进工作方法要和保守思想作斗争
    ——节录郝建秀工作法推广组工作总结
    为了要使郝建秀工作法为广大细纱工人掌握，使先进经验变成为广大群众的财富，青岛纺织工会和纺织管理分局组织了郝建秀工作法推广组，至各厂进行推广工作。截至目前止，青岛的全部细纱值车工基本上已经学会了郝建秀工作法。并获得了如下的成绩：
    （一）降低了皮辊花率，以厂为单位计算，一般的都降低了百分之三十至百分之五十一左右。
    （二）造成了青岛纺织工人前所未有的技术学习高潮。郝建秀工作法不仅仅是细纱工人在学习，现在已扩展至纺织厂中的每一个生产部门。
    （三）由于郝建秀同志善于虚心学习别人的经验，通过这一推广工作，发展了郝建秀工作法，如吸取了一厂粗纱接头捻接法、不拔管接头的方法等。
    总之，这一运动的开展，使青岛的细纱工作全面推进了一步，得出一个比较完整的细纱操作法。
  新与旧的思想斗争过程
    推广工作并不是一帆风顺进行的，推广过程就是一个新与旧之间的思想斗争过程。在推广初期，工人中就产生了以下主要的三种不正确的思想认识：
    第一种人对郝建秀有着过高的要求，认为郝建秀的操作方法一定样样特出，三勤三快行走如飞的传奇式人物。一看郝建秀表演后，动作并不出奇，怎么能少出皮辊花呢？就大失所望，认为还是车好使、活好作才能减少皮辊花，人力是没有办法的。
    第二种人认为郝建秀工作法还是“三勤三快”，多加一把力就行了；又看见郝建秀把几项工作结合起来搞，认为这样紧张的工作只是年青人能学，“俺老了，跑不动，不能学。”
    第三种人是自高自大带着保守性的老技术工人，刚看郝建秀表演就吵闹起来，专找缺点；什么接头有疙瘩，接空头等等，又叫喧着：“还要叫她来教咱，咱工龄还要比她年纪大，用咱的脚指头来作也要比她好。”
    在干部中有的说郝建秀只是分配时间好，其他动作是总结上夸大。有些人顾虑到郝建秀工作法在条件差、断头多的厂中行不通；在经纱车上能行，纬纱车上就不可以等等。
    在了解了以上几种思想情况后，就应用了各种方式来扫清这些思想障碍和解除这些思想顾虑。对不服气的人进行了个别谈话，又召集会议，号召自觉自愿地参加学习，并指出了要以虚心的态度才能体验到郝建秀工作法的好处。这样，基本上消灭了对抗思想。此外又通过拜师方式叫郝建秀虚心学习。如国营青岛第一棉纺织厂老工人谭玉芳开始时不服气，说郝建秀接头大，有羽毛纱。郝建秀就去向她学习。谭玉芳看到郝建秀是这样地虚心学习，因而感动了她也虚心向郝建秀学习。在下次讨论会上，她就说出了郝建秀工作法的优点来，讲出了心眼里的话：“俺跑了二十多年的冤枉腿，学了郝建秀工作法后可好了，工作比以前轻松的多了。”由于老工人的这些学习体会，使其他人更增加了学习的信心。其他几种思想情况，也都被事实打消了。因为谁学习了郝建秀工作法，谁就少出皮辊花，皮辊花愈是多的厂，降低得愈多；如五厂过去皮辊花出五、六磅，现在只一磅左右了。不仅降低了皮辊花，又减少了劳动力；如国营青岛第二棉纺织厂的养成工学习后，普遍要求多看锭子，张元凤过去看三百锭，现在看四百二十锭，皮辊花还出不到一磅。事实胜于雄辩，群众从实践中体会到了郝建秀工作法的优越性。
  巩固成果，不断前进！
    郝建秀工作法在青岛各棉纺织厂推广得很快，并且收效亦很大，现在各方面都已重视了这一个问题，这是很好的。但是有人担心着推广容易巩固难，这的确是很值得注意的。为了要巩固与取得进一步的发展，就必须注意下列的几点：
    （一）在推广中要深入具体，因为在真正领会郝建秀工作法的基本精神和能掌握运用后，不仅减少了反辊花，同时减轻了劳动强度，对自己亦有好处，怎么会不执行下去呢？不能巩固的原因是没有领会到郝建秀工作法的好处。所以在推广过程中，必须深入具体，反对一切形式主义和任务观点。根据各厂检查的结果，有些厂就是因为没有深入的推广，因此尚有些工人只学了郝建秀的“拉板不离手”及巡回，这是不够的。
    （二）是否能巩固下去，要看领导干部是否重视下去。不要把学习郝建秀工作法看成为一个单纯的任务，学会了就完了。应建立制度，经常检查。
    （三）丢掉老包袱及互相不服气，去掉骄傲和“只能表扬、不能批评”的作风，这些思想都是进步中的阻力。郝建秀同志就是从不自满、肯虚心的向人家学习、把人家一点一滴的好经验集中到她自己的工作法中，如在一厂学会了不拔管接头、粗纱捻接法等。所以，郝建秀工作法是各种创作的集中点。应当学习郝建秀的这种精神，才不致使工作停留于原有的水平上。
