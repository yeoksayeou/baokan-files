　　Seventh Anniversary of Romania's Liberation
　　Vasili Luga, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party
    August 23, 1951, marks the seventh anniversary of the liberation of Romania by the glorious Soviet army, celebrated by the working people of the Romanian People's Republic. Seven years ago today, the invincible Soviet army crushed the bandit troops of Hitler and Antonescu on the Kishinev-Iasi front and advanced towards our capital, Bucharest. In Bucharest, the democratic forces led by the Romanian Communist Party overthrew the Antonescu fascist dictatorship, withdrew Romania from the criminal Hitler war, and completed a historically significant action. This was a decisive turning point in Romania's history. It enabled the complete revival and independence of the Romanian nation, liberating the working people from the oppression of the bourgeois landlords. After the glorious Soviet army expelled the Hitler bandits, it entered Romania and became the liberator of the Romanian people. The Soviet army not only rescued the Romanian people from the quagmire into which they had fallen under the rule of the landlords, bourgeoisie, right-wing Social Democrats, and the Antonescu fascist clique, but also helped the Romanian people consolidate their national and social liberation, fully assisted us in building a new life, suppressed the revival of fascist bandits, and realized the people's democratic system. The Soviet Union's generous attitude towards Romania and all countries ravaged by fascist Germany, even towards defeated Germany itself, is a great manifestation of the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin regarding new types of national relations.
    In the seven years since liberation, through the struggle and efforts of the alliance of workers and peasants under the leadership of the Communist Party, and through the great political unity under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, Romania has won one victory after another in political, economic, and social aspects.
    Based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, Romania signed treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, sufficient to guarantee Romania's national independence and peaceful economic and cultural development. This made it possible to end Romania's dependence on Western countries, eliminate Romania's backwardness in economy and industry, and establish various prerequisites for building a socialist economy and carrying out a cultural revolution. Due to this new type of cooperation between large and small countries – a product of the great October Socialist Revolution – Romania is no longer isolated and no longer exploited by foreign capital.
    In these seven years, thanks to the efforts and struggles of the working people in urban and rural areas and all progressive elements who are enthusiastic about building a people's democratic system and loyal to building socialism, the relations between the Romanian nation and all other nationalities in the country have also undergone fundamental changes. In the Romanian People's Republic, all people, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or belief, are guaranteed equal rights by the Constitution. Disrespect for non-Romanian nationalities and a sense of superiority among the Romanian nation are prohibited by law. Stalin's principle of developing culture that is national in form and socialist in content is fully implemented in our country. The state allocates huge sums of money to establish the economic foundation of society and develop the economy and culture of those areas that were backward and impoverished under reactionary rule. This investment guarantees the economic prosperity of all minority areas, develops and improves their living standards, cultural levels, and develops their inherent dialects and languages. To promote the cultural development of minority nationalities, the state has allocated subsidies for 3,530 schools at all levels. The people of the whole country are united in the struggle to defend and expand the fruits of victory. More than 11 million people have signed the World Peace Council's declaration advocating a peace pact among the five major powers, which proves that the Romanian people wholeheartedly defend peace and build socialism.
    The past seven years have also been a process of arduous struggle, in which we defeated the reactionaries who served Anglo-American imperialism and attempted to undermine our country's economic revival and national independence. For example, our country has suffered consecutive droughts in the past few years. The imperialists and their running dogs in Romania attempted to use the hunger and famine caused by the drought to make the Romanian people sacrifice freedom in exchange for a little bread. The Romanian working people ruthlessly cracked down on the conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad. In 1948, the remaining bourgeois landlords were driven out of the government, and the royal rule was abolished, which initially created the various necessary conditions for the arduous revival of finance and economy, large-scale socialist construction, and the improvement of the living and cultural standards of the working people. It has only been three years since the nationalization of all basic means of production such as industrial production, transportation, mines, forests, banks, insurance companies, etc., and only two years since the implementation of planned economy. Thanks to the enthusiasm of the working people in building socialist industry, the industrial products produced by the planned economy implemented in just two years have increased by 2.4 times compared with 1948, and its effectiveness exceeds all the progress made in the 25 years under the rule of the bourgeois landlords. We can already produce our own oil industry equipment, machine tools, bearings, generators, ocean-going ships and inland river vessels, and electrical technology industrial equipment. In the three years since the nationalization of oil mines, oil production has increased and progressed rapidly year by year. The production volume in 1951 has greatly exceeded the amount stipulated in the economic plan.
    The steel industry, whose output is gradually increasing, is undergoing successful construction. The first five-year plan that started this year stipulates the establishment of a new iron and steel center. The chemical industry, coking ovens, cement plants, and building material enterprises are also under construction. The light industry of consumer goods is striding forward. In order to increase the output of iron sand and other metals, coal, and various resources, large-scale surveys have been carried out to prepare for mining during the five-year plan.
    Other huge construction plans, such as the excavation of the Danube-Black Sea Canal and the construction of the Lenin Power Station, have also made significant progress, at a speed unprecedented in our country's history. In addition to other effects, the above plans can irrigate millions of hectares of fields and completely transform the economy of backward areas. During this period of the five-year plan, it is also stipulated to build two railways, the railway from Umesti to Libajni, and the railway from Saba to Bisho. The "Mars Building," the most beautiful and modern building in Romania – a printing and publishing center – is also under construction. As a result of the widespread adoption of Soviet work experience and methods, productivity has steadily increased, and production costs have gradually decreased, which has greatly improved the living standards and cultural standards of our working people, and also gradually increased our funds for developing the economy and culture. It is precisely the full assistance of the Soviet Union, on the basis of economic cooperation, that enables us to obtain a large number of modern machines, industrial equipment, and raw materials, which has made the development of our socialist industry so rapid today.
    In the seven years since our country's liberation, the lives of the working peasants have undergone major changes. New types of farms – collective farms and state farms – have been realized. The first batch of collective farms has reached 1,069 in two years. This major achievement enables the working peasants living in the old-style rural areas to transition to the life of socialist rural areas. The state distributes land to poor peasants, and also provides assistance to peasants through loans, seed loans, and increased prices of agricultural products. Furthermore, due to the state's measures to restrict rich peasants, the poor peasants in the countryside have all risen to the level of middle peasants.
    Through the nationwide network of consumer cooperatives – socialist consumer cooperatives with 5.305 million members – peasants not only obtain more industrial products, but also sell their agricultural products without being subjected to intermediate exploitation and speculation. This year's bumper harvest guarantees a further improvement in the living standards of the peasants, and also guarantees the cities and workers' districts a rich supply of food.
    Significant achievements have also been made in improving the culture of the working people. In 1951, the state budget alone allocated 48.4 billion lei for designated national education and culture expenditures, an increase of 28 percent over last year.
    The greater our achievements, the more jealous our class enemies become. They constantly attempt to carry out sabotage to harm our country's socialist construction, and organize disturbances, assassinations, and send spies, etc. Enemies are organizing imperialism and its running dogs, including the fascist Tito clique, to interfere with us. Therefore, an important task for us is to raise vigilance everywhere, whether in industrial and agricultural enterprises, in government agencies, or in construction sites, and strengthen the discipline of the state, the party, and labor. Our people, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, are devoting all their efforts to the construction of the massive five-year plan, in order to lay the economic foundation of socialism. We want peace, and we have no intention of aggression. We recognize the dangerous situation in which the imperialist countries, disregarding the failure of the war of aggression in Korea, are attempting to provoke another new armed conflict. Our people are actively strengthening the struggle for peace, and are determined to complete the entire year's production plan for 1951 in eleven months to ensure a happy and fulfilling life for the people.

　　罗马尼亚解放七周年
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记  华西里·卢加
    一九五一年八月二十三日，罗马尼亚人民共和国的劳动人民庆祝光荣的苏联军队解放罗马尼亚七周年纪念日。七年前的今天，无敌的苏联军队在基斯纽——雅西前线粉碎了希特勒和安东尼斯古的匪军，向我们的京城——布加勒斯特推进，在布加勒斯特，以罗马尼亚共产党为首的民主力量推翻了安东尼斯古法西斯独裁统治，使罗马尼亚退出罪恶的希特勒战争，完成了具有历史意义的行动。这是罗马尼亚的历史上一个有决定性的转捩点。它使罗马尼亚民族完全复兴和独立，使劳动人民从资产阶级大地主的压迫中获得解放。光荣的苏军驱逐了希特勒匪帮之后，进入罗马尼亚，成为罗马尼亚人民的解放者。苏军不但把业已堕入大地主资产阶级、右翼社会民主党人和安东尼斯古法西斯统治集团的泥淖中的罗马尼亚人民拯救出来，而且接着又帮助罗马尼亚人民巩固这已经实现了的民族的和社会的解放，全力协助我们建设新的生活，抑止法西斯匪帮的复活，实现人民民主制度。苏联对于罗马尼亚以及一切受法西斯德国所蹂躏的国家，甚至对战败的德国本身的慷慨的态度，是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林关于新型民族关系思想的伟大表现。
    在解放以来的七年中，经过共产党领导下的工农群众的联盟的奋斗和努力，经过罗马尼亚工人党领导下的政治上的大团结，罗马尼亚在政治上、经济上和社会上各方面赢得一次又一次的胜利。
    基于无产阶级国际主义的原则，罗马尼亚和苏联签订了友好互助的条约，并与其他各人民民主国家签订了足以保证罗马尼亚的民族独立与和平发展经济文化的条约。这就有可能终止罗马尼亚对西方国家的依赖，扫除罗马尼亚在经济和工业方面的落后，并树立建设社会主义经济和进行文化革命的各种先决条件。由于这种大国和小国间的新型的合作关系——伟大的十月社会主义革命的产物，罗马尼亚再也不是孤立的，再也不受外国资本的剥削了。
    这七年中，由于为城乡劳动人民和一切热心于建设人民民主制度并忠实于建设社会主义的前进分子的努力和奋斗，罗马尼亚民族和国内其他一切民族的关系也起了根本的变化。在罗马尼亚人民共和国里，一切人民，不分种族、性别和信仰，均由宪法保证其享受平等的权利。对非罗马尼亚民族的轻视和罗马尼亚民族的优越感，均由法律予以禁止。斯大林的以民族为形式以社会主义为内容的发展文化的原则，我国充分付诸实行。国家指拨巨额资金，以建立社会的经济基础和发展那些在反动统治时候陷于落后和穷困的地方的经济和文化。此项投资保证一切少数民族地区的经济的繁荣，发展并提高其生活水平、文化水平以及发展其固有的方言文字。为促进少数民族的文化的发展，国家拨款补助各级学校三千五百三十所。在保卫和扩大胜利的果实的奋斗方面，全国人民团结一致。在今年世界和平理事会的拥护五大国缔结和平公约宣言上签名者达一千一百多万人，足证罗马尼亚人民是全心全意保卫和平与建设社会主义。
    过去七年同时也是一个艰苦奋斗的过程，我们战胜了服务于英美帝国主义并企图破坏我国经济复兴和民族独立的反动派。例如：我国在过去若干年中连续遭受旱灾。帝国主义者及其在罗马尼亚国内的走狗们企图利用亢旱所引起的饥饿和灾荒使罗马尼亚人民牺牲自由换取一点面包。罗马尼亚劳动人民无情地打击了国内外敌人的阴谋。一九四八年，把残存的资产阶级大地主分子逐出了政府，取消了皇室统治，始为财政经济的复兴和大规模社会主义的建设以及提高劳动人民的生活和文化水平艰辛地创造了各种必要条件。一切工业生产、运输、矿坑、森林、银行、保险公司等等基本的生产手段的国有化，迄今仅及三年，而实行计划经济则仅有二年。由于劳动人民建设社会主义工业的热诚，使短短二个年头中所推行的计划经济所产生的工业品，较一九四八年增加二·四倍，其成效超过资产阶级大地主所统治的二十五年中所有的进步。我们已经可以生产本国的采油工业设备、工作母机、轴承、发电机、海洋大船和内河航船、电气技术工业设备。油矿国有化以后的三个年头中，油产已经增加，并且逐年猛进，一九五一年的生产量已经大大超过经济计划所规定的额数。
    产量正在逐步增长的钢铁工业正在进行成功的建设。今年开始的第一个五年计划，规定建立一个新的冶铁中心。化学工业、炼焦炉、水泥厂和建筑材料企业亦均在建设之中。消费品的轻工业正迈步前进。为增加铁沙以及其他金属、煤和各种资源的产量，已经进行大规模的测勘，准备在五年计划中着手开采。
    其他巨大的建设计划，如开凿多瑙河至黑海的运河和建设列宁电力站，也有显著进展，其速度在我国历史中是前未曾有的。上述计划除其他效用外，尚可以灌溉数百万公顷的田园，可以完全转变落后地区的经济。在五年计划这个期间内，尚规定修筑二条铁路，巫麦斯蒂到利巴金尼的铁路，和沙巴到比萧的铁路。作为罗马尼亚一座最美丽和现代化的建筑物的“火星大厦”——印刷和出版中心——也在建筑之中，由于广泛采用苏联的工作经验和方法的结果，生产率稳步提高，生产费逐渐下降，使我国劳动人民的生活水准文化水准大大改善，也使我国用于发展经济和文化的资金逐渐增加。正是苏联全力的协助，在经济合作的基础上，使我们获得大量的现代化的机器、工业设备和原料，我国社会主义工业的发展，才有今日这样迅速。
    我国解放后这七年中，劳动农民的生活起了重大的变化。新型的农场——集体农庄和国家农场已经实现。第一批的集体农庄在二年之内已达一千零六十九处，此项重大成就，使生活于旧式农村的劳动农民过渡到社会主义的农村的生活。国家把土地分配给贫农，又用贷款、贷种子和提高农产品价格等方式给予农民以协助，更由于国家采取限制富农的措施，农村中的贫农均已上升至中农水平。
    通过全国规模的消费合作社网——社员人数达五百三十万五千的社会主义的消费合作社，不但使农民获得更多的工业品，而且使他们不受中间剥削和投机的损失而出售其农产品。本年的丰收，保证农民生活水准的再度提高，又保证城市和工人区获得丰美的粮食。
    至于提高劳动人民的文化方面亦有显著的成就。一九五一年国家预算仅就指定的国民教育和文化的经费而言，即达四百八十四亿列伊，较去年增加百分之二十八。
    我们的成就越大，阶级敌人也越嫉妒我们。他们经常地企图进行破坏，以危害我国社会主义的建设，并组织捣乱、暗杀和派遣间谍等等。敌人正在组织帝国主义及其走狗包括法西斯铁托集团在内，向我们进行干涉。因此我们的一项重要的任务，即是无论在工业农业的企业里，在政府机关里，在建筑工场里，处处要提高警惕，加强国家、党和劳动的纪律。我国人民，在罗马尼亚工人党领导之下，正倾全力于庞大的五年计划的建设，以求奠定社会主义的经济基础。我们要和平，我们没有任何侵略的企图。我们认清了帝国主义国家不顾在朝鲜侵略战争的失败而企图挑拨另一次新的武装冲突的危险局面。我国人民正积极加强争取和平的斗争，并决心以十一个月来完成一九五一年全年的生产计划，保证人民获得幸福和美满的生活。
