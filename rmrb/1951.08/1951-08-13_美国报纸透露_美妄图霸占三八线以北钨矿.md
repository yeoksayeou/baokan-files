US Newspaper Reveals
    US Attempting to Seize Tungsten Mines North of the 38th Parallel

    (Xinhua News Agency, August 11th) American newspapers revealed that one of the reasons why the U.S. government refuses to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line is that the U.S. covets the rich tungsten mines north of the 38th parallel. According to a TASS dispatch from New York on August 8th, citing a report in the "Daily Mirror": "Without Korean tungsten, the United States would not be able to manufacture enough jet engines and armor-piercing shells, and more importantly, it would not be able to meet the needs of atomic energy." The report continued: "The land occupied by Ridgway's troops north of the 38th parallel is rich in undeveloped tungsten deposits. This is one of the reasons why Ridgway is taking such a firm stance. The largest tungsten mine in the Free World (referring to the imperialist camp) is Sangdong, less than sixty miles south of the 38th parallel. Tungsten is now in short supply. We are shipping a lot of mining equipment to Korea to start work on the Sangdong mine and many mines scattered north of the 38th parallel. To meet civilian needs, our country is still short two million pounds of tungsten. Usually our country needs nearly fourteen million pounds of tungsten annually."

    "New York Post" reporter Alan also made the same revelation. He said that the inside story of the stalemate in the armistice negotiations is that Wall Street is determined to continue occupying the North Korean territory it now occupies and is already developing North Korean tungsten mines. Alan said: "The North Korean tungsten mines now under U.S. control are the richest deposits in the world outside of China... Within five days of these tungsten mines being occupied, their ore sands were shipped to the United States." Alan quoted U.S. Ordnance Bureau Director Small as saying that congressional leaders believed in a "secret meeting" that "it is very important that we control this area occupied by our soldiers in order to obtain the rich tungsten mines there."

### 美国报纸透露  美妄图霸占三八线以北钨矿

　　美国报纸透露
    美妄图霸占三八线以北钨矿
    【新华社十一日讯】美国报纸透露：美国政府之所以拒绝以三八线作为双方军事分界线，其中原因之一，是美国觊觎三八线以北的丰富的钨矿。据塔斯社纽约八日电引《每日镜报》的报道称：“没有朝鲜的钨，美国就无法制造足够的喷气式发动机与穿甲弹，更重要的是无法满足原子能方面的需要。”该报继称：“李奇微军队在三八线以北所占领的土地，拥有丰富的尚未开发的钨矿富藏。李奇微为什么要采取这样坚定的态度，这就是原因之一。自由世界（按指帝国主义阵营）最大的钨矿是三八线以南不到六十英里的桑洞。现在钨很感缺乏。我们运往朝鲜许多矿山设备，以便开始桑洞矿山及散布在三八线以北的许多矿山的工作。要满足民用需求，我国还缺少二百万磅钨。通常我国每年需要近一千四百万磅的钨。”
    《纽约邮报》记者艾伦也作了同样的透露。他说：休战谈判僵局的内幕，是华尔街决心继续占领它现在所占领的北朝鲜领土，并已经在开发北朝鲜的钨矿。艾伦说：“现在在美国控制下的北朝鲜钨矿，是世界上除中国以外的最丰富的矿藏……在这些钨矿被占领后五天之内，它们的矿沙就被运往美国了。”艾伦引用美国军火局局长斯摩尔的话说，国会领袖们在“秘密会议”上认为：“我们一定要控制我们士兵所占领的这块地方，以便取得那里的丰富的钨矿，这是非常重要的。”
