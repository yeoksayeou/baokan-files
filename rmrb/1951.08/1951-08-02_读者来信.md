            Answers to Several Questions Regarding this Year's Agricultural Tax
    Editor's Note: Since the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council promulgated the "Instructions on Agricultural Tax Collection Work for 1951" and the Central People's Government's Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Implementation Outline for Agricultural Tax Land Survey and Production Determination Work," many readers have written to raise many questions about the 1951 agricultural tax, which are now answered separately as follows:
    Q: What is "levying according to the rate"? How can "levying according to the rate" be achieved? Since the tax rate is "adapted to local conditions," is it not necessary to strictly levy according to the rate?
    A: "Levying according to the rate" means calculating the amount of tax payable by each household according to the tax rate stipulated by the tax law and collecting it accordingly. For example, the North China Region's Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax stipulate that each "burden mu" should be levied 21 jin of millet per year. Therefore, for each taxpayer household, the tax should be levied uniformly at a rate of 21 jin per burden mu. In some areas, the province and county both compile budgets based on the tax rate and the estimated yield per mu. However, because it does not match the actual yield per mu in each village, the result of implementation is that some villages levy 15 jin per burden mu, some levy 20 jin per burden mu, and some levy 30 jin, which is not considered levying according to the rate.
    How can we achieve levying according to the rate? First, we must abolish the old method of the county assigning "tasks" to the district and the district assigning "tasks" to the village, so as to avoid lower-level cadres subordinating the tax rate to the task, forming the bias of "dead task, flexible tax rate." Second, we must vigorously conduct land surveys and production determination, which is the basis for implementing levying according to the rate. Third, there must be a set of technical work to guarantee it. It is best for the entire county or district to centrally calculate the tax payable by each farmer household, and the county people's government should fill out and issue tax payment notices to each household. Fourth, while levying according to the rate, we must correctly implement the policy of tax reduction and exemption, and strive to achieve tax reduction and exemption according to law.
    The "adaptation to local conditions" of the tax rate is to take into account the economic characteristics of different regions and better implement the policy of reasonable burden; it does not mean that grain collection staff can arbitrarily change the tax rate. The Central People's Government's Government Administration Council stipulated in the "Instructions on Agricultural Tax Collection Work for 1951": "People's governments at all levels must strictly levy according to the tax rate approved by the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, and shall not freely increase or decrease it." Therefore, it is wrong to think that since the tax rate is adapted to local conditions, it is not necessary to strictly levy according to the rate.
    Q: Is it in line with the people's government's burden policy that the burden surface (the percentage of the tax-paying population in the agricultural population) is close to or reaches 100% after land reform?
    A: Before land reform, some farmers had little or no land, and their agricultural income was below the starting point for taxation, so they were exempt from agricultural tax; after land reform, farmers were allocated land, their income increased, and the income of most farmers reached above the exemption point, so they should naturally pay taxes according to law. In this way, the rural burden surface will inevitably expand. According to the survey materials of 46 townships (villages) in 15 counties of 6 provinces in East China and Central South, after land reform, the tax-paying population will reach 99.2% of the agricultural population. This shows that the burden surface after land reform will generally be close to 100%, which is an inevitable result. Since everyone has land to cultivate and income, everyone should pay taxes to supply the needs of national construction. Judging from the facts of the past few years, farmers' income has gradually increased and their living standards have gradually improved since liberation, and the agricultural tax burden surface has also expanded accordingly. The expansion of the burden surface after land reform is inevitable and in line with the interests of the broad masses of the people. Of course, newly emancipated households still have difficulties in production, and some are not yet accustomed to paying taxes. Therefore, this year's education and persuasion work for new taxpayers is of particular importance. This kind of publicity work should be extensive and in-depth, but also sincere and patient. It is also wrong for individual comrades to have the idea of not wanting to expand the burden surface and not wanting to persuade farmers.
    Q: Why does Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Agricultural Tax Collection Work for 1951" stipulate: "The agricultural tax on leased land and tenant land shall be levied separately according to the respective income of the lessor and tenant, and may be levied according to their agreement if there is a prior agreement. The income from leased land and the income from tenant land shall be calculated as 100 jin for 100 jin, and no additional or reduced calculation shall be made"?
    A: After land reform, there are not many remaining old landlord-tenant relationships. The lessors are mainly the families of martyrs, soldiers, and staff members without labor force, mostly elderly, weak, orphaned, or widowed households, or households with other occupations. Therefore, they cannot be regarded as the feudal exploitation of landlords. The landlord-tenant relationship after land reform has changed from the relationship between farmers and landlords to the internal relationship between farmers. Moreover, many landlord-tenant relationships have the nature of mutual assistance in production. Therefore, it is not necessary to add or reduce the rental income and tenant farming income (adding means calculating 100 jin of rental income as 120 jin, and reducing means calculating 100 jin of tenant farming income as 80 jin), but should be levied according to the respective income. However, if both parties have other agreements, they can be levied according to the agreement. For example, if both parties agree in advance that the agricultural tax will be paid in full by the lessor or in full by the lessee, the government will register and collect the tax from the lessor or lessee according to their agreement. This is beneficial to the production and unity of farmers, and at the same time, the calculation method is much simpler.
    Q: Why does Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Agricultural Tax Collection Work for 1951" stipulate: "For poor farmers with one or two people who are allocated more land than one or two people in accordance with the provisions of the Land Reform Law, when calculating agricultural tax, one-person households shall be calculated as two people for agricultural population, and two-person households shall be calculated as three people for agricultural population, in order to take care of them"?
    A: Article 13, Paragraph 1 of the Land Reform Law stipulates: "Poor farmers with only one or two people who have labor force may be allocated more land than one or two people when the land conditions in their township permit." It is necessary for the people's government to take care of single poor hired farmers in this way, but the agricultural tax stipulates that "agricultural income is calculated progressively based on the average per capita," which inevitably causes concerns for single people who are generally "empty-handed" and lack means of production. Therefore, when calculating the progressive rate for these households, one person can be calculated as two people, and two people can be calculated as three people for the agricultural population. This kind of care is necessary and reasonable.
    Q: The Government Administration Council's instructions on the work of collecting public grain in the summer of 1951 stipulate: "The proportion of public grain collected in summer and autumn...shall be determined according to the actual proportion of summer and autumn yields in the total annual yield in each region." What is the specific calculation method?
    A: The agricultural tax is calculated once a year and collected in summer and autumn. In order to balance the burden in summer and autumn, and to overcome the past phenomenon of less collection in summer and more collection in autumn (or more collection in summer and less collection in autumn), and to reduce the difficulties of the masses in paying taxes, the collection ratio in summer and autumn should generally be determined according to the ratio of the normal annual yield in summer and autumn to the normal annual yield. The calculation method and formula for the amount of tax payable in summer are as follows:
    (1) First, calculate the amount of tax payable by the household for the whole year according to the population, land, normal annual yield, and the agricultural tax rate in the area. The formula is:
    Total annual agricultural income of the household × Total annual tax rate payable by the household = Total annual tax payable by the household (Formula I)
    (2) According to the area of summer crops and the normal annual yield per mu of summer crops in the local area, calculate the summer yield, and then divide it by the total annual normal annual yield to obtain the proportion of summer yield in the total annual yield, which is the proportion of summer collection in the total annual collection. This proportion should generally be determined by the township as a unit (individual households in the township with particularly low summer harvests can be given individual consideration). The formula is:
    Local summer yield ÷ Local total annual yield = Local proportion of summer collection in the total annual collection (Formula II)
    (3) Multiply the percentage of summer collection in the total annual collection by the total annual tax payable to obtain the amount of tax payable in summer. The formula is:
    Total annual tax payable by the household × Local proportion of summer collection in the total annual collection = Amount of summer tax payable by the household (Formula III)
    (4) Subtract the amount of summer tax from the total annual tax payable to obtain the amount of autumn tax payable.
    The above is the general principle. If the summer harvest is small in some areas and the vast majority of farmers rely on it to survive the famine, the amount of summer collection can be appropriately reduced; if the summer harvest is large in some areas and the people have enough to eat, more can be collected. Secondly, if there is a poor harvest or a particularly good harvest in summer, the amount of summer collection may be appropriately reduced or increased.
    Q: Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the Central Ministry of Finance's "Implementation Outline for Agricultural Tax Land Survey and Production Determination Work" stipulates: "After the land yield is fixed, it will no longer be changed except for changes in natural conditions and other regulations stipulated by laws and regulations." What do the so-called "changes in natural conditions" and "other regulations stipulated by laws and regulations" refer to?
    A: "Changes in natural conditions" refer to changes in the natural conditions of the land due to reasons such as water erosion and sand pressure. "Other regulations stipulated by laws and regulations" refer to: (1) Those who have cultivated wasteland for the full tax-free period. For example, the wasteland reclaimed in a county in 1951 is legally tax-free for four years. The county announced the fixed yield in 1952, and when the tax-free period expires in 1954, the yield of this land should be filled in the land register and the household register. (2) Those who have improved the land by building water conservancy projects or other methods to reach the year of revising the yield. For example, a county in 1951 dug canals with self-raised funds and turned dry land into paddy fields, and legally levied taxes according to the yield of dry land for five years. The county announced the fixed yield in 1952. In 1955, the paddy field should no longer be levied according to the yield of dry land, but should be changed to the yield of paddy field. (3) Others explicitly stipulated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. After the land yield is fixed, it shall not be changed except for the above-mentioned special circumstances.

            We Cannot Relax Our Vigilance Against the Painful Lessons Because of Objective Difficulties
            ——Opinions on Comrade Xiao Cheng's Letter
    To the Editor:
    The several opinions raised by Comrade Xiao Cheng cannot but be said to be shortcomings in the implementation of the country's overall construction plan. However, the mistakes we have made in basic construction projects are not caused by these few shortcomings. The opinions expressed by many engineers and readers focus on criticizing the bad practice of "not being able to cook rice well even with rice" and shifting the blame to "objective reasons" when mistakes are made.
    Generally speaking, the main thing we are afraid of in today's basic construction work is not being slow, but making mistakes. For example, when the Third Paper Mill in Northeast China installed tap water pipes, it should have used 12-inch pipes, but because they didn't have them, they impatiently replaced them with 10-inch pipes, and as a result, they had to be removed and 12-inch pipes installed again. What problems can such "speed" solve? And many of the engineering errors discovered today belong to this type. It also happens that the cadres who review the budget have no on-site experience, and therefore approve the wrong budget. But if you really use the "iron materials" that have been unreasonably reduced and are not enough in fact, that is because the "employment concept" is at work. If you did not do this, and responsibly reported to the superiors that the iron materials were indeed not enough, the mistake could still be avoided. Therefore, we can say that a poorly approved budget, insufficient funds, and delayed project progress should not cause technical errors in the project.
    Almost every job is not easy to do at present. However, because most comrades can fight against difficulties at all times and in all places, most of the work is done fairly satisfactorily. According to the current situation in our country, is it necessary and possible to establish a huge equipment supply organization when carrying out basic construction in key areas only is another question. The phenomenon that Comrade Xiao Cheng said that "some equipment did not arrive at the work place according to the planned date in the middle of the work, and everyone sat and waited" is partly individual and partly may not be due to insufficient prior contact. If the prior contact is sufficient and the plan is well-thought-out, and the construction date is not determined behind closed doors, this phenomenon may not be avoided. In any case, as long as it does not cause the project to collapse, be destroyed, or be reworked, that is not what we should particularly emphasize today. As for equipment manufacturers failing to deliver on time, it is easier to solve. In the past, many agencies crowded into large cities to purchase or order goods, and many things went wrong. Later, after the local government unified control of procurement, the situation improved. Facts have proved that relying on the local government can eliminate losses such as being deceived and delayed delivery.
    In short, the points raised by Comrade Xiao Cheng are not the root causes of errors in basic construction projects. There are difficulties, but we cannot relax our vigilance against some painful experiences in the past because of difficulties! The articles of Comrades Dai Nianci, Li Yizhi, and Chen Jiagui are completely correct in attitude. We must first examine our past mistakes from the essence and from our own aspects.

            关于今年农业税若干问题的解答
    编者按：自中央人民政府政务院颁布《关于一九五一年农业税收工作的指示》，和中央人民政府财政部颁布《农业税查田定产工作实施纲要》之后，许多读者来信，提出了不少关于一九五一年农业税的问题，现在分别解答如下：
    问：什么是“依率计征”？怎样才能做到“依率计征”？税率既“因地制宜”，是否可以不必严格依率计征？
    答：“依率计征”，就是按照税法规定的税率计算各户的应纳税额，来进行征收。例如华北区农业税暂行条例上规定，每“负担亩”每年征收小米二十一市斤，那么，对于每个纳税户，就应一律按一负担亩二十一斤的税率征收。有些地区在省和县都是按税率和估计的田亩产量编造概算。但由于与各村实际的田亩产量不符，所以执行的结果，有的村每负担亩征收十五斤，有的村一负担亩征收二十斤，有的三十斤，就不算依率计征了。
    怎样才能做到依率计征呢？第一，要废止县对区、区对村分配“任务”的老办法，以免下级干部以税率屈从任务，形成“死任务活税率”的偏向。第二，要大力查田订产，这是实行依率计征的基础。第三，要有一套技术工作做保证，最好全县或全区集中计算各个农户的应征税额，并由县人民政府对户填发纳税通知书。第四，在依率计征的同时，要正确贯彻减免政策，争取做到依法减免。
    税率的“因地制宜”，是为了照顾不同地区的经济特征，更好地贯彻合理负担政策；并不是说，征粮工作人员可以随意变更税率。中央人民政府政务院关于一九五一年农业税收工作指示中规定：“各级人民政府必须严格依照中央人民政府政务院核准的税率计征，不得自由增加或减少”。因此，认为税率既因地制宜，便可不必严格依率的想法，是不对的。
    问：土地改革后负担面（纳税人口占农业人口的百分比）接近或达到百分之百，是否符合人民政府的负担政策？
    答：土地改革前，有些农民没有或仅有很少的土地，农业收入在起征点以下，所以免纳农业税；土地改革后，农民分得土地，收入增多了，绝大部分农户的收入都达到免征点以上，自然应当依法纳税。这样，农村负担面必然要扩大。据华东、中南六省十五县四十六乡（村）的调查材料看，土地改革后，纳税人口将达到农业人口的百分之九十九点二。这说明，土地改革后负担面一般的将接近百分之百，是必然的结果。既然大家有地种，有收益，大家就应当纳税，好供应国家建设的需要。从几年来的事实看，解放以后农民收入逐步增加，生活逐步提高，农业税负担面也就随之扩大。土地改革后负担面的扩大是必然的，是符合广大人民的利益的。当然，新翻身户在生产上仍有困难，有的对纳税尚不大习惯，因此，今年对新纳税户的教育说服工作，便有特别重要意义。这种宣传工作，既要广泛深入，又要恳切耐心。个别同志有不愿扩大负担面、不愿去说服农民的想法，也是不对的。
    问：政务院关于一九五一年农业税收工作的指示第三条第二项，为什么规定：“出租地和佃耕地的农业税，按业佃双方各自收入，分别依率计征，事先有协议者得依其协议计征。出租地收入和佃耕地收入，一百斤均作一百斤计算，不再加成或减成”？
    答：土地改革后，残存的旧租佃关系已经不多，出租者主要是无劳动力的烈士、军人和工作人员的家属，多系老弱孤寡户，或兼其他职业的户，因此不能视同地主的封建剥削。土地改革后的租佃关系已由农民与地主间的关系变为农民间内部的关系了。而且，很多租佃关系带有生产互助的性质。因此，出租收入和佃耕收入即不必加成或减成（加成即出租收入一百斤作一百二十斤计算，减成即佃耕收入一百斤作八十斤计算）而应按各自收入分别依率计征。但如双方另有协议的，则可依协议计征。例如双方事先约定农业税由出租人全部交纳或由承租人全部交纳，政府就依其约定向出租人或承租人登记征收。这样对农民的生产和团结，都是有利的，同时，计算方法也简便多了。
    问：政务院“关于一九五一年农业税收工作的指示”第三条第三项，为什么规定：“凡依照土地改革法的规定，一口人或两口人的贫苦农户分得多于一口人或两口人的土地，在计算农业税时，一口人的农户得按两口人计算农业人口，两口人的农户得按三口人计算农业人口，以资照顾”？
    答：土地改革法第十三条第一款规定：“只有一口人或两口人而有劳动力的贫苦农民，在本乡土地条件允许时，得分给多于一口人或两口人的土地”。人民政府对单身贫雇农这样照顾是必要的，但农业税规定“按每人平均农业收入累进计征”，却使一般“家底空虚”，缺乏生产资料，刚刚翻身的单身汉难免不发生顾虑。因此，对这些户在计算累进率时，一口人可按二口人，二口人可按三口人计算农业人口。这种照顾，是必要的，合理的。
    问：政务院关于一九五一年夏季征收公粮工作的指示中规定：“夏秋两季征收公粮数额比例……根据各该地区夏、秋产量各占全年产量的实际比例拟定”，具体的计算方法是怎样的？
    答：农业税是规定全年一次计算，分夏、秋两季征收的。为使夏秋两季负担平衡，并克服过去夏征少，秋征多（或夏征多、秋征少）的现象，减少群众纳税的困难，夏秋的征收比例一般应按夏秋常年应产量占全年常年应产量的比例来确定。夏征应纳税额的计算方法和公式如下：
    （１）首先根据人口、土地、常年应产量及各该地区的农业税税率计算出该户全年应纳税额，其公式是：
    本户全年农业收入×本户全年应纳税率＝本户全年应纳税额（公式Ⅰ）
    （２）根据当地夏季作物面积及每亩夏季作物常年应产量，求出夏季产量，再以全年的常年应产量除之，得出夏季产量占全年产量的比例，也就是夏征占全年征收额的比例。这种比例一般以乡为单位确定为宜（乡之内个别户夏收特少者，可予个别照顾）其公式是：
    当地夏季产量÷当地全年产量＝当地夏征占全年征收比例（公式Ⅱ）
    （３）以夏征占全年征收额的百分比乘全年应纳税额，即得夏征应纳税额，其公式是：
    本户全年应纳税额×当地夏征占全年征收额比例＝本户夏征税额（公式Ⅲ）
    （４）全年应纳税额减去夏征税额即为秋征税额。
    上述是一般原则。如某些地区夏收较少，广大农民赖以度荒者，可酌减夏季征收额；某些地区夏收较多，人民吃用有余，也可以多征一些。其次，如夏季歉收或特别丰收时，亦得酌情减少和增加夏征的数额。
    问：中央财政部“农业税查田定产工作实施纲要”第二条第三款规定“土地产量固定后，除因自然条件变化及法令另有规定者外，不再变更。”其中所谓“自然条件变化”和“法令另有规定”是指什么说的？
    答：“自然条件变化”是指因水冲沙压等原因而使土地自然条件发生变化。“法令另有规定者”是指：（一）垦种荒地已满免税年限者。例如某县在一九五一年开垦的生荒，依法免税四年。该县在一九五二年宣布固定产量，到一九五四年免税期满时应将此地产量填入土地清册和分户清册。（二）因兴修水利或以其他方法改良土地已达改订产量年限者。例如某县在一九五一年以自筹资力开凿水渠，变旱地为水田，依法在五年内仍按旱地产量计征。该县一九五二年宣布固定产量，到一九五五年时，该水田即不应再按旱田产量计征，而应改按水田产量计征。（三）其他经中央人民政府政务院明令规定者。土地产量固定后，除有上述特殊情况者外，不得变更。
            不能因为有客观困难就不接受惨痛的教训
            ——对萧成同志的信的意见编辑同志：
    萧成同志所提出的几点意见，就国家的全面建设计划的实施上，不能不说是缺点。但是，我们在基本建设工程上所已发生的错误，却并不就是这几个缺点造成的。许多工程师和读者们发表的意见，着重指摘的是“有了米还做不好饭”，批评的是有了错误就推卸给“客观原因”的坏作风。
    就一般情形来说，我们今天的基本建设工作主要的还不是怕慢，而是怕错误。像东北第三造纸厂按装自来水管，应用十二英寸管，因为没有，就迫不及待地以十英寸管来代替，结果还是得撤了再装十二英寸管。这样的“快”，能解决什么问题呢？而今天所发现的工程错误，就有很多是属于这一类型的。审核预算的干部没有现场经验，因而批错了预算，也是有的。但如果你真正用无理核减了而事实上不够用的“铁料”来施工，那就是由于“雇佣观点”在作祟。假若你没有这样做，负责地向上级提出铁料确是不够用，错误还是可以不发生的。因此，我们可以说：预算批不好，经费拨不下，迟缓了工程的进行，但它不应当使工程在技术上发生错误。
    目前每一件工作差不多都不能得心应手。但是，由于大部分同志都能时时处处跟困难作斗争，所以绝大部分的工作都做得还算满意。根据我们国家当前的情况，仅仅在重点地进行基本建设的时候，是不是有建立庞大的器材供应机构的必要和可能，是另外的问题。萧成同志所说“干到中途有些器材未依照计划日期到达工作场所，大家坐以待之”的现象，一方面是个别的，一方面也未必不是由于事前联系不够密切所致。如果事前联系够，计划周到，不是关着门定出施工日期，这种现象未始不可以避免。无论如何，只要它不致使工程坍塌、毁弃或返工，那还不是我们今天所应该特别强调的事情。至于器材厂商不按时交货，更容易解决。过去有许多机关拥挤在大都市采购或定货，出了好多事情。后来经当地政府统一管制采办后，情形就好转了。事实证明依靠当地政府是可以消灭受骗和交货误时之类损失的。
    总之，萧成同志所提出的几点，都不是使基本建设工程发生错误的根本原因。困难是有的，但我们不能因为有困难而对过去的一些惨痛经验放松警惕！戴念慈、李一之和陈家珖诸同志的文章，在态度上是完全正确的。我们必须先从本质上和自己方面来检讨我们过去的错误。
