　　Do Not Misuse Terms Only Understood by a Small Circle of People

    In its editorial entitled "Correctly Use the Language of the Motherland, and Strive for the Purity and Health of the Language!", the People's Daily criticized the bad phenomenon of some people "deliberately 'creating' various terms that only a small circle of people can understand," which is very necessary. I will now tell you about a troublesome matter caused by a person writing a letter of introduction who misused a term "only understood by a small circle of people."

    On July 15th, Comrade Li Chunshan, who was coming to Shenyang from Jilin for the first time, came to our Northeast Federation of Trade Unions to inquire about the address of the "Shenyang Supply and Marketing Cooperative." According to him, he had asked many places after getting off the train in Shenyang, but he could not find the address of the "Shenyang Supply and Marketing Cooperative." Because there are many "Supply and Marketing Cooperatives" in Shenyang, our colleagues in the office could not answer him either. Later, he took out a letter of introduction. We took a look and realized that the Jiangnan Chemical Factory of Jilin Province had sent him to Shenyang to attend a meeting, introducing him to the "Shenyang Supply and Marketing Cooperative" for accommodation and meals; so we made several phone calls on his behalf to the organization preparing for the meeting to inquire, but still could not find out. Finally, a comrade speculated: "He was sent by a state-owned factory in Jilin Province, maybe he was introduced to some supply and marketing cooperative of Jilin Province in Shenyang!" As a result, we found the phone number of the "Jilin Provincial State-Owned Industry Shenyang Supply and Marketing Cooperative" in the telephone directory. After inquiring by phone, we learned that the "Shenyang Supply and Marketing Cooperative" mentioned in the letter of introduction was indeed the "Jilin Provincial State-Owned Industry Shenyang Supply and Marketing Cooperative," and Comrade Li Chunshan finally found the place for accommodation and meals.

    I hope this example will draw everyone's attention, so that when writing letters or articles, we will no longer use terms that only a small circle of people can understand, so as to avoid many unnecessary troubles.

### 不要乱用仅仅一个小圈子里面的人才能懂得的名词

　　不要乱用仅仅一个小圈子里面的人才能懂得的名词
    人民日报在以“正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！”为题的社论里，批判了某些人“故意‘创造’一些仅仅一个小圈子里面的人才能懂得的各种词”的不良现象，这是十分必要的。我现在告诉你们一件写介绍信的人乱用“仅仅一个小圈子里面的人才能懂得”的名词，而引起很多麻烦的事情。
    七月十五日，有一位从吉林初次来沈阳的李春山同志到我们东北总工会询问“沈阳供销处”的地址。据他说，他在沈阳下火车后曾问了很多地方，但总没有问到“沈阳供销处”的地址。因为在沈阳的“供销处”很多，我们机关的同志也无法答复他。后来，他拿出一封介绍信。我们一看，原来是吉林省营江南化工厂派他到沈阳来参加一个会议，介绍他到“沈阳供销处”食宿的；就代他打了好几个电话给筹备该会议的机关询问，结果还是问不到。最后有一个同志推测说：“他是吉林省营工厂派来的，可能是介绍他到吉林省在沈阳的什么供销处去吧！”结果，我们在电话本上找到了“吉林省公营工业沈阳供销处”的电话。经过电话询问，知道介绍信中所说的“沈阳供销处”确是“吉林省公营工业沈阳供销处”，李春山同志才算找到了食宿的处所。
    希望这个例子能引起大家的注意，在写信、写文章时不再用仅仅一个小圈子里面的人才能懂得的名词，以免发生很多不必要的麻烦。
