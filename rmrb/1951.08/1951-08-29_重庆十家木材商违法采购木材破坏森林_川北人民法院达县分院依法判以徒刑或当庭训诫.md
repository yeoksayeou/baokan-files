　　Ten Timber Merchants in Chongqing Illegally Procure Timber and Destroy Forests
    Dazhou Branch of the North Sichuan People's Court Sentences Them to Imprisonment or Admonishes Them in Court According to Law

    The ten timber factories in Chongqing City, namely, Private Minye, Minguang, Minxie, Minliang, Minfeng, Minyong, Mintong, Minli, Minwei, and Jufu, illegally purchased timber in Xuanhan County, North Sichuan, and colluded with landlords to steal forest timber, which caused the masses of farmers to fell trees indiscriminately, resulting in severe damage to the forests. The Dazhou Branch of the North Sichuan People's Court has sentenced them according to law.

    Xuanhan County, North Sichuan, has dense forests and abundant timber resources, which have long been the target of Chongqing timber merchants. Wang Zhiyuan, the person in charge of the Minye Timber Factory, took a letter of introduction from the forestry authority of the North Sichuan Administrative Office to the Xuanhan County People's Government on December 21, 1950, to apply for logging registration. The county issued a letter of introduction and designated logging areas, stating that the district and township governments concerned must survey the forest area before issuing a logging permit. However, Wang Zhiyuan did not comply with the regulations. Instead, he went to the Chenshou District, a non-designated area, and colluded with Chen Quanwu, chairman of the 14th branch of the Qingxi Township Farmers Association in that district, to instigate Chen to use his position to deceive farmers into felling trees, which Wang then purchased. Wang also went to other non-designated areas, such as the southeast township of Chenshou Town and the Donglin Township of Tiansheng District, to collude with landlords Fei Mushan, Wang Xuanchu, Zhu Zhou, and others, and openly stole timber. As the land reform had not yet been carried out in the county, the farmers saw the landlords felling and selling large quantities of timber and, not knowing the truth, followed suit and competed to fell trees. As a result, the county's forests suffered great losses.

    Subsequently, nine other timber factories in Chongqing, including Minguang and Minfeng, also rushed to Xuanhan County after hearing the news and illegally purchased timber one after another. They relied on landlords and used local small timber dealers as pawns. Without registering with the government first, they cut down all the forests completely. Landlords in Shihuang, Jinshi, Chixi, Nanba, Qingxi, and other townships in Xuanhan County took the opportunity to destroy the forests, with the degree of destruction exceeding 80 percent in all cases. All the green hills near the rivers and convenient for transportation have been completely turned into barren slopes. This seriously infringed upon the fruits of victory that farmers should have obtained after their liberation and caused incalculable losses to the long-term interests of the people. According to preliminary statistics from the county's Agriculture and Forestry Section, the amount of forest felled from December 1950 to mid-March of this year has exceeded the total felling volume in the four years before liberation. It is estimated that more than 200,000 trees were cut down.

    The Xuanhan County People's Government issued a notice on November 15, 1950, strictly prohibiting the destruction of forests. On February 25 this year, the county's Agriculture and Forestry Section also notified all districts to stop felling and purchasing. On March 4, timber merchants engaged in purchasing were urged to register with the county People's Government. Although the timber merchants registered one after another, they did not stop purchasing. On March 9, the county's Agriculture and Forestry Section again notified all districts and townships, strictly prohibiting all indiscriminate felling, purchasing, and transportation of timber, and freezing the bank deposits of timber merchants in Xuanhan County. Only then did the timber merchants have to stop their illegal activities. At this time, seeing the seriousness of the situation, the Xuanhan County People's Government sent six cadres and invited thirty students from Xuanhan Normal School to conduct in-depth investigations in various townships. (Editor's note: This method of mobilizing students to do investigative work for the government is not good and should not be done again in the future.) After the investigation, the materials were submitted to the County People's Court, which filed a public prosecution. Finally, on June 18, the Dazhou Branch of the North Sichuan People's Court rendered a judgment. In addition to properly handling the illegally purchased timber, Wang Zhiyuan, the person in charge of the private Minye Timber Factory, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for illegally purchasing timber and causing serious damage to the country's forest resources. Chen Quanwu, the village Farmers' Association chairman who committed dereliction of duty, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and fined. Most of the other illegal timber merchants were admonished in court. The illegal landlords who stole and sold timber will be investigated and dealt with separately by the Xuanhan People's Court after the price has been recovered.

    In its judgment, the Dazhou Branch of the North Sichuan People's Court particularly refuted the incorrect arguments repeatedly emphasized by the timber merchants, such as "cash transactions, freedom of trade." New Democratic law only protects legitimate public and private trade. Article 37 of the Common Program clearly stipulates: "...Freedom of domestic trade shall be implemented within the framework of the unified national economic plan, but speculative commerce that disrupts the market must be strictly prohibited...." Moreover, the timber merchants illegally felled and purchased timber in various places without going through legal procedures, which not only directly violated trade policy but also violated Article 34 of the Common Program regarding "protecting forests and developing forestry in a planned way" and Article 33 of the Land Reform Law regarding "before the completion of land reform...all illegal...felling of trees is strictly prohibited...." Therefore, the timber merchants must not use "freedom of trade" as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities.

　　重庆十家木材商违法采购木材破坏森林
    川北人民法院达县分院依法判以徒刑或当庭训诫
    重庆市私营民业、民光、民协、民良、民风、民用、民同、民力、民伟、聚福十家木材厂在川北宣汉县违法采购木材，并勾结地主盗伐森林，由此引起农民群众的滥伐，使森林遭受了严重破坏。川北人民法院达县分院已依法予以判决。
    川北宣汉县森林茂密，盛产木材，久为重庆木商注意的目标。民业木厂负责人汪志远于一九五○年十二月二十一日，拿川北行署林业主管机关的介绍信，到宣汉县人民政府申请登记采伐。当经该县发给介绍信，并指定采伐地区，说明须会同当地区、乡政府查勘林区后，再行核发采伐证。但汪志远并未遵守规定，而擅自到非指定地区的城守区，与该区清溪乡农民协会十四分会主席陈全五互相勾结，唆使陈利用其职权，欺骗农民，砍伐林木，由汪收购。汪又到其它非指定地区，如城守镇东南乡、天生区东林乡等地，勾结地主费木山、王玄初、朱周氏等，公然盗伐。由于该县尚未进行土地改革，农民看见地主大量砍伐林木出卖，不明真相，也相继起来竞相砍伐。因而使该县森林遭到很大损失。
    嗣后，重庆民光、民风等九家木厂也闻风赶到宣汉县，相继违法采购。他们依靠地主，利用当地小木贩作爪牙，都不先到政府登记，就把所有的森林都砍个干净。宣汉县士黄、金石、赤溪、南坝、清溪等乡地主遂乘机破坏森林，破坏程度都在百分之八十以上。所有靠近河道和运输较方便的青山，已完全变成童秃不毛的荒坡。这就严重地侵犯了农民翻身后应得的胜利果实；使人民长远利益遭到难以估量的损失。据该县农林科初步统计：自一九五○年十二月至今年三月中旬，森林被采伐的数量，已超过解放前四年间的总采伐量。估计被砍树木在二十万棵以上。
    宣汉县人民政府曾于一九五○年十一月十五日布告严禁破坏森林；该县农林科在今年二月二十五日又通知各区制止砍伐购买；三月四日，促令进行收购的木商向该县人民政府办理登记手续。各木商虽陆续登记，但并未停止采购。三月九日，该县农林科再次通知各区、乡，严令禁止一切滥伐、收购及运输木料行为；同时冻结各木商在宣汉县的银行存款。这样一来，各木商才不得不停止他们的非法活动。这时，宣汉县人民政府见事态严重，就派出干部六人，邀请宣汉师范学校学生三十人，分别深入各乡调查。（编者按：这种动员学生为政府做调查工作的办法是不好的，今后不应该再这样做。）调查后把各项材料交县人民法院，提起公诉。最后，于六月十八日，由川北人民法院达县分院予以判决，除对违法采购的木材予以适当处理外，对私营民业木厂负责人汪志远违法采购木材，使国家森林资源受到严重损失，判处有期徒刑一年。违法渎职的村农民协会主席陈全五判处有期徒刑一年，并科以罚金。其余如违法木商大多予以当庭训诫。盗卖木材的不法地主，除追缴其价款外，由宣汉人民法院查明后，另案处理。
    川北人民法院达县分院的判决书中，特别着重地批驳了该木商等屡次强调的“现款交易，贸易自由”等不正确论据。新民主主义的法律只保障合法的公私贸易。共同纲领第三十七条中明确地规定：“……在国家统一的经济计划内实行国内贸易的自由，但对于扰乱市场的投机商业必须严格取缔。……”况且，该木商等未经合法手续，即在各地滥伐采购，不仅直接破坏贸易政策，而且也违反共同纲领第三十四条关于“保护森林，并有计划的发展林业”，以及土地改革法第三十三条关于“在土地改革完成以前……严禁一切非法的……砍伐树木……”等规定。因此，各木商决不能以“贸易自由”为借口，推卸其罪责。
