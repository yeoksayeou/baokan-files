Leading Organs Not Serious and Responsible, Survey and Design Careless
　　Chaobai River Niumutun Diversion Channel Entrance Project Was Washed Away
　　North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau Has Conducted Inspections and Made Self-Criticism

　　The Niumutun Diversion Channel Entrance Project on the Jidong Chaobai River suffered partial damage to the diversion channel entrance (gate) project due to the lack of attention from leading cadres and careless survey and design during last year's floods and this spring's thaw.
　　The Chaobai River Niumutun Diversion Channel Entrance Project is one of the seven important projects in the Chaobai River Downstream Regulation Project organized by the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau in 1950. This project can divert 700 cubic meters per second of water from the Chaobai River above Niumutun into the Bei Canal, in order to reduce the water volume in the new Chaobai River channel. The project was completed on July 3, last year. On July 13, floodwaters passed through, and the situation was good. On July 19, the water flow increased sharply, and eddies formed upstream of the entrance, scouring a deep pool, endangering the upstream apron (a structure to prevent scouring of the entrance) and the foundation of the revetment, causing most of the concrete apron (5 meters wide) in front of the upstream sheet piles and the wire cage-filled brick apron (5 meters wide) to subside. On August 3, after a torrential rain, the river water rose sharply, and a section of the revetment upstream of the east guide dike subsided again. After the thaw in the spring of 1951, a section of the upstream of the west guide dike developed horizontal cracks due to foundation settlement. Although this project played a certain role in flood diversion and protection during the 1950 flood season, it had to be repaired in 1951 due to the collapse of some of the project, causing economic losses to the state. (The original labor and material costs for the damaged part of the project were approximately 400,000 jin of millet.)
　　The North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau has conducted inspections and self-criticism on this project, and believes that the reasons for the partial damage to the Niumutun Diversion Channel Entrance Project are as follows:
　　1. The upstream diversion channel was not widened at the junction with the entrance to form a gradual transition channel. The original channel was too narrow, about 27 meters, and the flow was steep and rapid during the initial rise of the floodwaters. The entrance guide dike was about 70 meters wide, and the flood flow suddenly widened, thus forming eddies, scouring a deep pool upstream of the entrance. The soil beneath the apron upstream of the sheet piles and the revetment slope of the guide dike was scoured into holes, and the upper structures consequently subsided.
　　2. The location of the entrance was at the original breach, and the upstream and downstream diversion channels were not regulated. The downstream flow direction was relatively straight, but the upstream main flow was diagonally inclined towards the middle of the east guide dike, causing this section of the revetment to bear too much force.
　　3. The apron upstream of the sheet piles was constructed of concrete. During the flood, the soil beneath was scoured into holes, and the upper concrete inevitably subsided. If this section of the apron had been constructed with soft materials such as wire cage-filled bricks, it would have folded down as a whole under the same flood conditions, without hindering the safety of the apron.
　　4. The foundation of the revetment slope in the middle of the east and west guide dikes was not pile-driven, because the soil was considered quite solid during construction. In fact, during the 1950 flood, the east guide dike was exposed to the flow, and some of the foundation soil was washed away, causing the revetment slope foot to sink, and the brick slope to subside accordingly. The revetment slope in the middle of the west guide dike did not have any problems during the 1950 flood season, but during the thaw in the spring of 1951, the foundation foot moved, and cracks were found in the brick slope.
　　Since the project had the above four shortcomings, it suffered partial damage after being tested by the flood. The main reasons for these shortcomings are:
　　1. The leading cadres were not serious and responsible for this project. In 1950, the leading cadres of the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau focused most of their efforts and time on considering the new channel and the East Diversion Channel project, and felt that the entrance project was small in scope and simple in nature, and never conducted in-depth inspections during the survey, design, and construction.
　　2. The survey and design work was careless. The collection of data for the entrance project was insufficient during the survey and measurement. Some plans were based solely on indoor inferences, without thorough research, and the situation was underestimated. For example, during the survey and measurement of the entrance project, no investigation was made on the annual flow conditions of the original diversion channel at the entrance, whether eddies occurred, the degree of scouring, and the geological structure of the riverbed, and no further understanding was gained by going deep into the masses. The planning ignored the gradual transition channel upstream, so that eddies occurred when the flood flowed into the entrance, scouring the foundation. The design also lacked a correct estimate of the hard concrete apron foundation upstream.
　　3. There was a purely task-oriented view in the construction. In order to complete the project before the flood season, no attention was paid to raising problems and actively finding solutions during construction. For example, water pits remained upstream during construction, but no attention was paid to them. After the completion of the entrance, the upstream diversion channel was not regulated to straighten the flow direction, and the oversights in planning and design were not promptly raised and corrected.
　　The above errors caused losses in the project and increased the state's financial expenditure. The North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau has made self-criticism on this.

　　领导机关不够认真负责·勘查设计粗枝大叶
    潮白河牛牧屯引河口门部分工程被冲毁
    华北水利工程局已进行检查并作检讨
    冀东潮白河牛牧屯引河口工程，由于领导干部不够重视，勘查设计粗枝大叶，去年洪水和今春解冻时，引河口门（闸门）工程被冲毁一部。
    潮白河牛牧屯引河口工程是一九五○年华北水利工程局所举办的潮白河下游整理工程中七项重要工程之一。这一工程可以将潮白河牛牧屯以上的流水，分出七百秒公方，经引河泄入北运河，以减少潮白河新河道的水量。工程于去年七月三日完工。七月十三日涨水流过，经过情形良好。七月十九日流水大增，口门上游发生漩溜，淘成深潭，危及上游海漫（防止口门被冲刷的建筑）及护岸基础，使上游板桩前的混凝土海漫（宽五公尺）及铅丝笼装砖的海漫（宽五公尺）大部沉陷。八月三日暴雨，河水大涨，东导水堤上游一段护岸又下沉。一九五一年春天解冻以后，西导水堤上游一段因基础沉陷，发生横向裂纹。这项工程一九五○年汛期时虽然曾经发生了一定的分洪保障作用，但是因为部分工程的坍塌，一九五一年则必须进行修补，造成国家经济上的损失。（该项工程损坏部分原用工费约四十万斤小米。）
    华北水利工程局对此项工程已进行检查和检讨，认为造成牛牧屯引河口门工程局部损毁的原因有如下几点：
    一、上游引河与口门接连处未开挖展宽做成渐变河槽。原河槽过窄，约有二十七公尺，涨水初期波陡流急，而入口门导水堤约宽七十公尺，洪流骤然放宽，因而形成漩溜，在口门上游淘成深潭。板桩上游的海漫和导水堤护坡的基土被冲刷成穴，上部建筑因而随之下沉。
    二、口门位置在原缺口处，上下游引河未加整理，对下游流向尚称直顺，对上游则大溜（河水的主流）斜趋东导水堤中部，致此段护坡过于吃力。
    三、板桩上游的海漫系用混凝土建筑。洪水时，基土被冲刷成穴，上部混凝土自必沉陷。此段海漫若用软料如铅丝笼装砖等构造，遇同样洪水则一体下折，对于海漫安全，并无妨碍。
    四、东西导水堤中部护坡基础未打基桩，因为施工时感到土质相当坚实。实际上一九五○年洪水时东导水堤靠流，即有部分基土被冲走，护坡基脚陷落，砖坡乃随之下沉。西导水堤中部护坡，一九五○年汛期虽未发生问题，但一九五一年春解冻时，基脚走动，砖坡发现裂纹。
    工程既然存在着以上四种缺点，所以一经洪水考验，即发生局部损坏。造成这些缺点的主要原因是：
    一、领导干部对这个工程不够认真负责。一九五○年潮白河的七项工程，华北水利工程局领导干部大部力量和时间放在考虑新河道和东引河工程上，觉得口门工程范围较小，性质单纯，在勘查设计和施工期间从未进行深入检查。
    二、勘查设计工作粗枝大叶。勘查测量时对口门工程的资料搜集得不够。作计划时有些仅以室内推断的现象作为依据，而没有缜密研究，对情况也估计不足。如口门工程勘查测量时，对于原有引河在口门处每年过水情况如何，有无漩溜现象发生，及其淘刷程度以及河床地质构造等，均未加调查，更未能深入群众做进一步的了解。规划时忽略了上游的渐变河槽，以致洪水流入口门便发生漩溜，淘刷了基础。设计时对上游硬性混凝土海漫基础也缺乏正确估计。
    三、施工中有单纯任务观点。为着要在汛期前把工程赶完，施工中就没有注意提出问题并主动地想办法解决。如施工时上游尚留有水坑，但亦未加注意研究。口门完成后，并没有把上游引河加以整理以顺流势，对于在规划设计上疏忽之点，未能及时提出加以改正。
    由于以上的错误而造成工程上的损失，增加了国家财政的开支。华北水利工程局对此已作检讨。      （中央水利部通讯组）
