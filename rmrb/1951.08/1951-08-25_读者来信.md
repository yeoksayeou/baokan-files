　　The Newly Built Warehouse of the Zhejiang Provincial Company of China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation Is Completely Unsuitable, Causing Huge Losses to National Assets
　　Editor:
　　The grain warehouse built by the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation in a certain area in 1950 suffered a significant loss of state assets due to inadequate planning, blind construction, lack of post-construction inspection, and failure to research and accept public opinion. After completion, the entire project was unusable. The warehouse project was designed by the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation, reported to the higher authorities for record, and then entrusted to the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Company for construction and contract signing. It officially started construction on March 6 this year. Except for auxiliary projects, it has been basically completed. The housing portion, originally planned for 594.73 million yuan for 60 rooms, has exceeded the original plan in labor and expenses upon completion. According to the plan, the average capacity per room was over 166,000 catties, but only 90,000 catties were stored after the start of the purchase. At 5:00 PM on August 6, two rooms collapsed, and another room collapsed at 9:00 AM on the 7th. Most of the other warehouses have not stored grain, and the stored grain is creaking. Some only store 70,000 catties, and the "sleeper beams" are broken. The entire project is unusable. The loss from the collapse of the houses, the damage to the grain (bagged), and the transportation alone is 30 million yuan. Remedial reconstruction in the future will not only result in a major loss of 100 million yuan to national assets but also delay the time and affect the storage task of large-scale purchases after the new grain is on the market.
　　The reasons for the damage are: First, the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation did not conduct thorough planning. Although it had consulted with the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Company for design, and it was reviewed and approved by the Warehouse Construction Supervision Team of the East China Trade Department (stationed at the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation), when deciding on the five or six design drawings, they did not delve into the load-bearing capacity of the "horizontal bracing" and "sleeper beams" of the foundation, but simply considered which one was "cheaper" and which one could be "completed quickly," without considering the actual effect, and started construction rashly, which ultimately led to the collapse. Second, the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Company contracted the construction task of the plan, which means it agreed with and supported the original plan. Sheng Jiankang, the chief construction engineer, claimed: "I never took out the drawings to study and check the design problems afterward." Thus, they neither rejected the construction of unreasonable plans nor conducted inspections, and did not propose any suggestions for improving the original design based on objective conditions. What is particularly serious is their lack of concern for government decrees. The "Notice on Strictly Inspecting the Design of Basic Construction Projects" issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on June 19 required the entire country to complete discussions and inspections by the end of July. However, neither party conducted discussions or inspections. Third, they did not follow the mass line and did not adopt the opinions of the workers. After the construction, workers such as Chen Xiaojia raised concerns about the insufficient load-bearing capacity of the "sleeper beams" and "horizontal bracing" and suggested making "ground coir walls." However, the engineers of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Company and the personnel in charge of supervision failed to study and propose suggestions for improving the original plan to the higher authorities when encountering new situations.
　　This fully illustrates the irresponsible attitude of the relevant personnel in design and construction, who have taken a perfunctory approach to basic construction, causing significant losses to national assets.
　　On August 8, the East China Branch of the Basic Construction Engineering Department of the Central Trade Department has sent engineers to inspect the site with the design and construction engineers of the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation and the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Company, together with the relevant local authorities, and initially discussed remedial measures. The grain from the collapsed portion was rescued by the morning of August 9 and is now being reported for processing.

　　The Suiyang Branch of the Mudanjiang Forest Industry Bureau of the Northeast Region Is Irresponsible for National Timber Resources
　　Signing Contracts Without Supervision Leads to Rampant Logging
　　Editor:
　　According to Wang Shiqing, the head of the Forest Administration Section of Dongning County: In March last year, the Suiyang Branch of the Mudanjiang Forest Industry Bureau of the Northeast Region signed a contract with Zhang, a resident of Hebei Village, Second District, Dongning County, to fell 15,000 cart pillar logs. At the time of signing the contract, the dimensions of the cart pillar logs were not clearly specified, and technical personnel were not sent to the site for guidance afterward, allowing them to cut down trees blindly and indiscriminately. As a result, many of the felled trees did not meet the specifications for cart pillar logs. More than 30,000 trees were felled, but only 15,000 were usable. This experience and lesson has not yet attracted the attention of the bureau's leading cadres. In February this year, the bureau signed a contract with Shahezi Village, Seventh District, to fell 15,000 railroad ties (oak trees), still adopting the same approach, and still allowing the villagers to enter the mountains and cut down trees indiscriminately without following specifications. The stumps were left very high, generally exceeding 30 centimeters, and even up to 90 centimeters. The treetop wood was also not reasonably utilized and was thrown all over the mountains. These two times totaled a loss of more than 1,000 cubic meters of timber, equivalent to more than 300 million yuan in Renminbi. The bureau's bad attitude of not caring for and being irresponsible for the national forest has caused undue losses to the forest. The bureau should receive due punishment.

　　The Bankrupt Fallacy of the Advocates of Wu Xun
　　The article "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" proves that Wu Xun was a historical sinner who faithfully served the landlord class. The fallacy of the advocates of Wu Xun cannot but be bankrupt in the face of such ironclad facts; those who held a skeptical attitude toward the criticism of Wu Xun will no longer have any doubts!
　　Facts prove that the era in which Wu Xun lived was precisely the era when the peasant revolutionary movement was developing vigorously. According to the section "Song Jing Poetry, the Local Peasant Revolutionary Leader Contemporaneous with Wu Xun" in the investigation, more than 60 people from Wang Erzhai Village, which is very close to Wu Xun's hometown, participated in the Black Flag Army, the peasant revolutionary force at the time, and almost all adults participated. This shows that Wu Xun had nothing to do with the revolutionary movement at the time, and the path he chose was a counter-revolutionary path.
　　From the sections on Wu Xun's land exploitation and usury, it can be seen that Wu Xun's exploitation of the peasants was extremely cruel, and he obtained the privileges granted by the reactionary rulers at the time. Why would the reactionary rulers give him privileges? Precisely because his actions were directly beneficial to the reactionary rulers. This can be fully proven by the fact that the students of "Chongxian Yishu" were mostly landlords, and later became Xiucai, Tongsheng, Juren, and so on.
　　From the fact that Wu Xun worshiped many so-called "godmothers" and the young widow gave birth to "small bean curd," it can be seen to what extent Wu Xun's behavior was despicable and shameless.
　　Li Shizhao said that Wu Xun was "a pioneer of the oppressed peasant class," and Sun Yu said that Wu Xun "established free schools for poor children" and "served the people."
　　Facts speak louder than words, and these fallacies cannot but be completely bankrupt in the face of ironclad facts.

　　"A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" Reveals the Truth About Wu Xun's "Education"
　　Editor:
　　Wu Xun, the man and his deeds, has been further confirmed by "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun."
　　Regarding the problem of "The Story of Wu Xun", I have always had this view: "Wu Xun is indeed not worth learning from, let alone praising, but his motivation for promoting education is at least good." The reason is that we cannot use "Marxism-Leninism" to measure historical figures today. It was not until I read "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" that I realized that Wu Xun was a traitor to the working people.
　　Especially after reading the historical facts of his "education," I thoroughly understood. I learned that his "education" was just a stepping stone to climb to the throne of the ruling class, not for poor children at all.
　　Why did I have this wrong understanding before? It was precisely because I failed to analyze and study the problem using Marxism-Leninism, and mechanically separated the motive from the effect; on the other hand, it also shows the confusion in my thinking. I am a person who has received normal education, but my estimation of the role of education in society is insufficient; in the past, I thought that education alone could transform that cannibalistic society. I didn't understand at all that education has class nature. I will strengthen my learning and improve myself in the future.

　　中国粮食公司浙江省公司新建仓库
    全部不适用使国家资财遭受巨大损失
    编辑同志：
    中国粮食公司浙江省公司在某地所建一九五○年度粮食仓库，由于事前设计不周密，盲目施工，事后没有检查，又不研究和接受群众意见，完工后工程全部不适用，造成国家资财重大损失。该仓库工程由中国粮食公司浙江省公司设计，呈报上级备案后，委托浙江省建筑公司承办并订立合同，在今年三月六日正式开工。现在除附属工程外已基本完工。房屋部分六十间原计划五亿九千四百七十三万元，完工时人工与经费已超出原计划。按照计划平均每间容量为十六万六千余斤，开始收购后，才放九万斤。于八月六日下午五时就倒塌二间，七日上午九时又倒塌一间。其他大部分仓库未储粮，已储粮的在轧轧作响，有的仅储粮七万斤，“磉板”已破碎，工程全部不适用。仅房屋倒塌，粮食损坏（袋装）及搬运，损失即三千万元。今后补救改建，不但国家资财遭受一亿元重大损失；而且耽误了时间，影响新谷登场后大量收购的储藏任务。
    检查损坏原因：一、主要是中国粮食公司浙江省公司没有周密设计。虽曾会同浙江省建筑公司设计，并经华东贸易部建仓督导组（驻中国粮食公司浙江省公司办公）审阅同意，但五、六个设计图样集中决定时，没有从设计中钻研基础部分的“横架斜撑”“磉板”荷重力如何，而是单纯考虑那一个“省钱”、那一个能“速成”，不问实效，贸然施工，终至倒塌。二、浙江省建筑公司承包了该计划的施工任务，就是表示对原计划的同意和支持。施工主任工程师盛建康自称：“事后从未拿出图研究检查设计问题。”这样既不拒绝不合理计划的施工，更不作检查，没有根据客观情况对原设计提出改进的建议。特别严重的是不关心政府法令。六月十九日政务院财政经济委员会“关于严格检查基本建设工程设计的通知”，通令全国应在七月底讨论和检查完成。但双方从未进行讨论与检查。三、不走群众路线，对工人意见不采纳。在施工后，工人陈小加等对“磉板”“横架”荷重不够问题曾提出意见，建议做“地砻墙”。但当时浙江省建筑公司工程师及负责监工人员未能在遇到新的情况时进行研究和向上级提出改进原计划的建议。
    这充分说明了设计和施工的有关人员不负责任的态度，对基本建设是采取了草率从事，使国家资财遭受重大损失。
    八月八日，中央贸易部基本建设工程处华东分处已派工程师与中国粮食公司浙江省公司、浙江省建筑公司的设计、施工工程师会同当地有关机关检查，并初步讨论了补救办法，倒塌部分的粮食已于八月九日上午抢救完毕，现在正呈报处理中。

　　牡丹江森林工业管理局绥阳分局对国家木材资源不负责任
    订了合同不监督放任滥伐
    编辑同志：
    据东宁县林政科长王世卿谈：东北牡丹江森林工业管理局绥阳分局于去年三月间与东宁县第二区河北村张某订立采伐车立柱一万五千根的一份合同。在订立合同当时，既没有把车立柱的尺寸交代明确，嗣后也没有派技术人员到现场进行指导，随他们的便盲目滥砍。结果，伐下的木材，多不合乎车立柱的规格要求。砍了三万多根，只有一万五千根合用。这次的经验教训，还没有引起该局领导干部的重视。在今年二月间，该局与第七区沙河子村订立采伐枕木（柞树）一万五千根的合同，仍然采取同样方式，仍然放任该村农民入山不按规格地滥砍，伐根留得很高，普遍超过三十公分以上，甚有到九十公分的。梢头木也没有合理利用，扔得满山遍野。这两次共约损失木材一千立方公尺以上，折合人民币三亿多元。该局这种对国家森林不加爱护不负责任的恶劣态度，使森林遭受了不应有的损失。该局应受到应得的处分。

　　武训宣传者的谬论破产了
    《武训历史调查记》一文，证明了武训是一个忠实为地主阶级服务的历史罪人。武训宣传者的谬论，不能不在这种铁的事实面前破产了；那些对批评武训抱着怀疑态度的人们再也不会有什么怀疑了吧！
    事实证明：武训所处的时代正是农民革命运动轰轰烈烈发展的时代。据该调查记“和武训同时的当地农民革命领袖宋景诗”一节所载，离武训故乡很近的王二砦村即有六十多人参加了当时农民革命队伍黑旗军，差不多所有壮年人都参加了。这说明了：武训对当时的革命运动丝毫没有关系，他所选择的道路是反革命的道路。
    从武训的土地剥削与高利贷剥削二节中可以看出，武训对农民的剥削是极为残酷的，他取得了当时反动统治者所给予的特权。反动统治者为什么会给他的特权呢？正是因为他的行动直接对反动统治者有利。这从“崇贤义塾”学生的成份大部分是地主，而后来都成了秀才、童生、举人等事实，就可以充分证明。
    从武训拜了许多所谓“干娘”，青年寡妇生出了“小豆沫”的事实，可以见到武训为人的下流，已经到了何等卑鄙无耻的程度。
    李士钊说：武训是“被压迫农民阶级的先觉者”，孙瑜说武训“为穷孩子们兴办义学”、“为人民服务”。
    事实胜于雄辩，这些谬论，在铁的事实的面前不能不完全破产了。

　　《武训历史调查记》揭露了武训“兴学”的真相
    编辑同志：
    武训其人其事，已由《武训历史调查记》进一步证实了。
    对《武训传》问题，我一直有着这样的看法：“武训的确是不足为训的，更不值得歌颂，可是，他的兴学动机至少还是好的”。理由是我们今天不能用“马列主义”的尺去衡量历史人物。直到看了《武训历史调查记》之后，我才认识到：武训是一个劳动人民的叛徒。
    特别是看了他“兴学”的那段史实，才不折不扣地明白了。我了解到他的“兴学”不过是借此作进身之阶，爬上统治阶级的宝座，绝非为了穷孩子。
    我以前为什么会有这种错误认识呢？正是由于我未能用马列主义去分析研究问题的结果，将动机与效果机械地分来看；另一方面也说明了我思想的混乱。我是一个受过师范教育的人，可是，对教育在社会上所起的作用估计是不足的；过去，我认为单凭教育就可以改造那吃人的社会。丝毫不懂得教育是有阶级性的。我今后要加强学习，提高自己。
