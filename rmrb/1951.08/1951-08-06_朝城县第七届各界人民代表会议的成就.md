Achievements of the Seventh Session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in Chaocheng County
    Lin Hong
    Editor's Note: The Seventh Session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in Chaocheng County, Pingyuan Province, has already exercised the functions and powers of the County People's Congress. Through this conference, the will of the people of the county was concentrated, and the patriotic production increase movement was vigorously promoted. This fact fully proves that holding good people's representative conferences can unite the broad masses of the people around the people's government and form a powerful and unified force to complete the various construction tasks of our country. At present, the people's representative conferences in many places have formalism; or they hold so-called "one-package" meetings, where the number of cadres attending exceeds the number of representatives by several times, essentially becoming cadre meetings that simply accept work tasks, reducing the due powers of the people's representative conferences; there are even phenomena of opposing people's representative conferences to central work, or using the excuse of being busy with work to not hold people's representative conferences. These are all erroneous ideas that ignore the people's democratic regime and should be promptly checked and corrected.
    Chaocheng County, Pingyuan Province, is an old liberated area. The people's political consciousness is relatively high, and they have basically formed an organized force. Therefore, the seventh session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles held in the county on April 15 has exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress. At the meeting, the county head and members of the government committee were elected, and resolutions were passed to further carry out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and the patriotic production increase movement in the county. Although this meeting still had some shortcomings, such as insufficient discussion of proposals and failure to handle individual resolutions seriously after the meeting, the meeting further promoted democracy and closely united the people of the county under the banner of patriotism, making significant achievements in the patriotic production increase movement and other central tasks.
    The county's leadership attached great importance to the convening of this meeting and began preparations more than a month in advance. First, county and district cadres were organized to study documents on the construction of the democratic regime, and then teachers and students were organized to go deep into the countryside to conduct extensive publicity to the masses, focusing on explaining the nature of the people's representative conference, its relationship with the people, the issues to be resolved at this People's Representatives Conference of All Circles, and how to elect representatives and submit proposals. This enabled cadres and the people to recognize the significance and importance of this meeting. In the election of representatives, the county conscientiously implemented the provisions of the "Organizational Rules for People's Representatives Conferences of All Circles in the County," allocating representative quotas with workers and peasants as the main body, while also appropriately taking care of people from all walks of life. The election of representatives was based on the actual situation, adopting a combination of direct election, indirect election, recommendation, and invitation. For example, occupational representatives from institutions, the education sector, and representatives from areas with concentrated residents were directly elected by voters; administrative villages composed of several natural villages, where the masses lived scattered, had voters from each natural village elect candidates, and then mutually recommend formal representatives. More than 80% of the representatives elected by the people at this conference were elected by the people. This made the representatives' scope and representativeness more adequate, the people's response was good, and it was an important reason for the success of this conference. In addition, the meeting promoted the spirit of democratic consultation and paid attention to the education and improvement of the representatives. The preparatory committee of the meeting was based on the standing committee of the previous People's Representatives Conference of All Circles, inviting representative figures from all walks of life to expand and form a joint responsibility for the various preparations for the meeting. The list of the presidium of the meeting was also submitted to the meeting for approval after full consultation and revision. Therefore, it included representatives from all aspects, enabling the opinions of the representatives to be reflected in a timely manner, which played a great role in the success of the meeting. During the meeting, patriotic education was also carried out for the representatives, organizing them to discuss current affairs issues, hold forums, recall and compare their lives before and after liberation, and denounce the crimes of the United States in arming Japan, greatly improving the political consciousness of the representatives. Because the county adopted these correct measures, the various agendas of the meeting could be successfully passed, playing a good educational role for all representatives and cadres, inspiring their enthusiasm, so the various resolutions of the meeting could be smoothly implemented.
    After the closing of the meeting, all the representatives, with a serious and responsible spirit, separately convened mass meetings or representative meetings in their regions or industries to conduct extensive and in-depth dissemination and publicity. Many representatives took the lead in using their own practical actions to mobilize and organize the people to implement the various resolutions of the meeting. For example, Liu Youliang, a representative from Taoyuan Village, after conveying the message at the mass meeting of the whole village, immediately took the lead in weeding seedlings and planting cotton, and mobilized the masses to dig two wells. Li Chunzhi, a female labor model representative, organized 36 women to carry water to plant cotton, led 31 women to weed more than 100 mu of wheat fields, mobilized 80% of the households in the village to select wheat seeds, and also cultivated many female activists in the work. Chen Shutian, a representative from the business community, mobilized merchants to prepay taxes. At the same time, the county and district people's governments also separately convened district and village cadre meetings, and the village governments convened village people's representative meetings to formulate specific measures for implementing the resolutions of the meeting. The county people's government sent a large number of cadres to assist various villages in carrying out drought resistance and cotton planting work.
    Under the active efforts of all representatives and cadres at all levels, a wave of patriotism quickly swept the county. According to the investigation of the county's leading departments, as of mid-June, the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea has basically been made known to every household, and the proportion of adults who have a relatively clear understanding of the reasons for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea has reached 80% among adult men and 50% among adult women. Among the 363 natural villages in the county, 209 have signed patriotic covenants. Among the 107 schools, 102 have signed patriotic covenants. Other organizations such as the Communist Youth League at all levels and women's federations have also mostly signed patriotic covenants. Driven by such a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, the county's patriotic production increase movement and various other tasks have achieved remarkable results. For example, the county's drought resistance and cotton planting plan, as decided by the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles, was to complete 30,000 mu in ten days. As a result, more than 35,000 mu were watered and planted in eight or nine days, exceeding the plan. In order to resist drought and sow, the county originally planned to dig 300 wells before the wheat harvest, but after publicity and mobilization, it increased to 432, and 301 were completed before the wheat harvest. Significant achievements have also been made in lending waterwheels and selecting improved varieties. As of June 5, the county's cotton had been weeded three times, and some had been weeded four times. Millet, sorghum, and other crops had also been weeded one to three times. In terms of tax revenue, the county's first quarter business tax was paid in full in three days, and 130 merchants prepaid more than 64 million yuan in taxes. People from all walks of life actively assisted the people's government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, successfully banning reactionary secret societies such as Yiguandao, and controlling lawless landlords and other lawless elements, which played a great role in consolidating social order and safeguarding production and construction. For example, in April, there were 41 cases of rumor-mongering, assassination, and arson in the county, while in May, there were only six cases of landlord reversal and theft. As a result of the conscientious guarding by the militia and self-defense forces, the wheat harvest order in the county this year was extremely good.
    Because Chaocheng County held the Seventh Session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles well, it has further improved the political awareness of the masses and inspired their enthusiasm. Therefore, it has achieved these remarkable results in production and construction and various tasks, which fully proves the great function of this basic system of our national regime.

　　朝城县第七届各界人民代表会议的成就
    林洪
    编者按：平原省朝城县的第七届各界人民代表会议，已代行了县人民代表大会的职权。经过这一会议，集中了全县人民的意志，强有力地推动了爱国丰产运动。这一事实充分证明：开好人民代表会议，就能够把广大人民团结在人民政府的周围，形成强大统一的力量，去完成我们国家的各项建设任务。目前许多地方的人民代表会议，存在着形式主义；或者召开所谓一揽子会议，列席干部超过出席代表数倍，实质上变成了单纯地接受工作任务的干部会议，减低了人民代表会议应有的职权；甚至仍有把人民代表会议与中心工作对立，或借口工作忙，而不召开人民代表会议的现象。这都是忽视人民民主政权的错误思想，应该迅速检查纠正。
    平原省朝城县是老解放区。群众的政治觉悟较高，基本上已形成有组织的力量。因此该县于四月十五日所举行的第七届各界人民代表会议，已代行了人民代表大会的职权。在会上选举了县长和政府委员会委员，通过了在全县进一步开展抗美援朝运动、镇压反革命运动和爱国丰产运动的决议。这次会议虽然还有一些缺点，如提案的讨论不够充分，会后个别决议案的处理不够认真，但会议进一步发扬了民主，在爱国主义的旗帜下，把全县人民紧密地团结起来，使爱国丰产运动等项中心工作获得显著成绩。
    该县领导部门对于这次会议的召开很重视，会前一个多月就开始了准备工作。先组织县、区干部学习民主政权建设的文件，然后又组织教员学生深入农村，向群众作了广泛的宣传，着重说明人民代表会议的性质，它和人民的关系，此次各界人民代表会议所要解决的问题，以及怎样选举代表和提出提案等。这样就使得干部和人民认识到此次会议的意义和重要性。在代表的选举上，该县认真地执行了“县各界人民代表会议组织通则”的规定，代表名额的分配以工人和农民为主体，同时又适当地照顾了各阶层人民。代表的选举，则视实际情况，混合采用直接选举、间接选举、推选和邀请四种办法。如机关、教育界等职业代表和居民集中的区域代表，由选民直接选举；几个自然村合成的行政村，群众居住分散，则由每一自然村的选民选出候选人，然后再互相推选正式代表。该县此次会议由人民选举的代表已达总数的百分之八十以上。这样就使代表的广泛性和代表性都比较充分，群众的反映良好，是此次会议开好的一个重要原因。此外，会议还发扬了民主协商的精神，注意了对代表的教育和提高。会议的筹备委员会，是以上次各界人民代表会议常务委员会为基础，邀请各界代表人物扩大组成，共同负责会议的各项准备工作，会议的主席团名单，也是经过充分协商修改后，才交会议通过的。因此它包括了各方面的代表人物，使代表的意见能及时反映上来，对于开好会议起了很大作用。会议期间，又向代表进行了爱国主义教育，组织他们讨论、座谈当前的时事问题，回忆对比了解放前后的生活，控诉了美国武装日本的罪行，大大地提高了代表的政治觉悟。因为该县采取了这些正确的措施，使会议的各项议程能够顺利通过，对全体代表和干部起了良好的教育作用，启发了他们的积极性，因而会议的各项议决案能够顺利贯彻执行。
    会议闭幕后，全体代表以认真负责的精神，分别召开本区域或本行本界的群众会或代表会，进行了广泛深入的传达和宣传，许多代表并带头以自己的实际行动，来动员组织人民实现会议的各项决议。如桃园村代表刘友亮在全村群众会上传达后，立即带头锄苗、种棉，并发动群众打了两眼井。妇女劳动模范代表李春芝，组织了三十六个妇女挑水点种棉花，带领三十一个妇女锄麦田一百多亩，发动全村百分之八十的户作了小麦选种，并且还在工作中培养了许多妇女积极分子。工商界代表陈书田，发动商人预交税款。与此同时，该县县区人民政府也分别召开了区村干部会议，村政府召开了村人民代表会议，制定了贯彻会议决议的具体办法。县人民政府派出大批干部，协助各村进行抗旱植棉工作。
    在全体代表和各级干部的积极努力下，该县迅速地掀起了爱国主义的热潮。截至六月中旬为止，根据该县领导部门的调查，抗美援朝运动已基本上作到了家喻户晓，对于抗美援朝的道理了解得比较清楚的，在成年男子中已达百分之八十，成年妇女中达百分之五十。全县三百六十三个自然村，已有二百零九个订立了爱国公约。一百零七个学校中已有一百零二个订立了爱国公约。其他如青年团各级组织和妇女会等，也大部订立了爱国公约。在这样高度的爱国热情推动下，该县的爱国丰产运动和各项工作已获得显著成绩。如全县的抗旱植棉计划，各界人民代表会议的决议，是在十天内完成三万亩，结果在八、九天内就挑水点种了三万五千多亩，超额完成了计划。为了抗旱下种，全县原计划在麦收前打井三百眼，经宣传动员后增至四百三十二眼，麦收前已打成三百零一眼。在贷放水车和挑选优良品种方面也获得显著成绩。到六月五日为止，全县的棉花已普遍锄过三遍，有的锄过四遍，谷子、高粱等也锄过一至三遍。在税收工作方面，全县第一季的营业税三天就缴齐了，并有一百三十户商户预缴税款六千四百多万元。各界人民均积极协助人民政府镇压反革命，胜利地取缔了一贯道等反动会道门，管制了不法地主和其他不法分子，对于巩固社会秩序和保卫生产建设起了很大作用。如该县四月份发生造谣、暗杀和纵火等案件四十一起，而五月份则仅发生地主倒算和偷盗案六起。由于民兵和自卫队认真看守的结果，该县今年的麦收秩序极为良好。
    朝城县因为开好了第七届各界人民代表会议，已经进一步提高了群众的政治觉悟，启发了群众的积极性，因而在生产建设和各项工作上获得这些显著的成绩，这就充分证明了我们国家政权这一基本制度的伟大功能。
