Southwest Industrial Department Steel Administration Bureau and related departments
Inspect the basic construction of the 101 Steel Plant

The basic construction of the Chongqing 101 Steel Plant over the past year has overcome some difficulties and made some achievements, which has played a role in improving production; however, there are serious problems in the work. In order to thoroughly understand the basic construction situation of the plant, the Industrial Department, Steel Administration Bureau, Finance Department and other relevant departments of the Southwest Military and Political Committee sent cadres to form an inspection team to inspect the plant. The preliminary inspection results are now described as follows:

Large-scale and unrealistic plan.

The basic construction plan of the plant is large-scale and unrealistic. The plant has blindly and rashly prepared plans time and time again, first from small to large, then from large to small, and then from small to large again. It has never carefully considered how it should be practical in accordance with the subjective and objective conditions and development trends. For example, the plan submitted by the plant in May 1950 included 73 projects. When the plant put forward this plan, it did not distinguish between priorities, nor did it correctly estimate the subjective conditions. After the plan was made, no efforts were organized to complete it. Few of the projects in the plan are practical and urgently needed, and only 40 percent have been started; only a little over 11 percent of those started have been completed. In July of the same year, the plant put forward a second plan, adding 59 construction projects. This plan was not approved by the highest competent authority, and there were no funds or manpower. Among the 59 construction projects, 18 have been started; 5 have been completed, 2 of which are not urgently needed; 2 have been started and then stopped, one of which has accumulated 2.1 billion yuan of funds due to poor design; and 8 are under construction. In August of the same year, the plant put forward a third plan. Although this plan removed unrealistic projects, it added 44 new and very fragmented projects, making the plan larger and extending the completion period. At the same time, the plan was still not approved by the highest competent authority, so there were no funds, and only three projects were started; two of which were stopped because they were not needed. The 1951 plan was indeed more streamlined than the previous plans, with only two new projects added and many old projects removed, but there are still 103 items. This proves that the plant's leading cadres have not learned from the lessons of the past year and still have not considered whether this huge plan is necessary and whether there is the strength to complete it.

When formulating the basic construction plan, the plant did not fully consider the relevant issues. For example, the construction of two new open-hearth furnaces, together with the existing two open-hearth furnaces, will produce at least × tons of steel per year, requiring × tons of steelmaking raw materials. However, when formulating the plan, it was not considered where these raw materials would come from. Other issues such as high costs, product types and sales were not mentioned in the various plans.

The formulation of the plan was not handled in accordance with the prescribed work procedures. The person in charge of the plan did not study the prescribed basic construction work procedures and did not understand the meaning and content of the plan outline, preliminary design and technical design. Although the numbers specified on the form have been filled in, many important explanations have been omitted, and the real difficulties and shortcomings have not been stated. The preliminary design should have been prepared before the annual plan was prepared, but it has not been produced yet. The remaining technical design, design work plan, and construction work plan cannot be sent out until now, and there is no more accurate estimate of when the project will be completed.

Rough design and repeated errors.

In the plant's 1951 plan, some projects only listed the drawing work of the equipment itself, but the overall picture and interrelationships of these projects were not designed, which caused many errors. For example, there is only one steel heating furnace, but two steel pushers were made, wasting 100 million yuan of funds. A certain department's project only listed a few machines, but there were no installation layout drawings. The factory building has not yet been designed, and it is not known where the machines will be placed, so they can only be placed in the open air, accumulating 270 million yuan of funds. The sewer system was not designed as a whole, only the total culvert numbers were listed, but the drainage capacity was not enough, and the factory building has been flooded repeatedly. The site of the open-hearth furnace was not designed correctly and changed twice, wasting more than 60 million yuan in excavation costs.

Most of the plant's projects were started hastily with only partial and rough designs, resulting in many errors and changes. Last year, the furnace was built, and it was only then discovered that there was no chimney. For the first floor slab of a certain factory building, it was only after the steel bar formwork was made that it was discovered that the belt hole had been forgotten, and the drawings were revised again. The design is rough and superficial, and no serious investigation and research is carried out, which causes waste. For example, when determining the location of a certain machine room, no careful survey was conducted in advance, and construction was started rashly using old pre-Liberation drawings. After excavating 1,300 cubic meters of earth and stone and driving more than 60 fir piles, it was discovered that the soil was soft and not suitable for a car house, and another location had to be selected. The types and quantities of equipment required for steel rail straightening work were not calculated and considered, and construction was decided, but later it was stopped due to manufacturing difficulties and the surplus capacity of straightening equipment, resulting in a loss of about 200 million yuan. Other product waste caused by irresponsible design personnel is even more difficult to list.

Careless construction and waste of materials.

Due to lack of careful consideration by the Planning Section of the plant, many projects that should have been done were not done; projects that should not have been done were done; some projects were urgently needed, but after construction started, they were in a state of semi-paralysis due to lack of manpower. When purchasing machinery and materials, the specifications were often not specified in advance or the purpose was not assigned, so they were not suitable after purchase. For example, a certain purchase of steel plates bought one and a half times more two-point steel plates, but did not buy three-point steel plates, so two two-point steel plates were stacked and used as three-point steel plates, resulting in a loss of hundreds of millions of yuan in labor and materials. A certain machine material was bought more than 50 percent more than needed, accumulating more than 2 billion yuan of funds. Because too much of a certain material was purchased and not stored properly, it was corroded by water, causing damage worth about 48 million yuan. Because local construction was carried out without a complete design, some machines could not be installed after they were manufactured, and some machines were not suitable after they were manufactured, accumulating a lot of funds. The lack of necessary systems in construction and the phenomenon of shoddy work have also occurred a lot, and rework is often necessary.

In the construction process, the lack of coordination between basic construction work and production work also affected the efficiency of basic construction. The Basic Construction Department of the plant never signed contracts when ordering goods from the Manufacturing Department, and the Manufacturing Department did not guarantee the delivery date to the Basic Construction Department because it was busy with production. The completed or half-completed parts were not properly kept, and they were allowed to rust in the open air or even be lost. When foreign parts were delivered to the workshops, the workshops were unwilling to take responsibility for safekeeping. Some were trapped in mud and gravel, and some were picked up as scrap iron. The upper water pan of three gas furnaces in a certain department was dismantled by other departments for other purposes, and now another set has to be made. There are also some parts that the plant is unwilling to make and pushes to outside private factories, but no one checks them.

Leadership lets things go.

The reasons for the above problems in the basic construction work of the 101 Steel Plant, in addition to the lack of experience, insufficient manpower, and insufficient inspection by the leading organs, are mainly that the leading cadres of the plant have neglected the basic construction work and have not recognized the great significance of basic construction. Of the five main responsible cadres of the plant, only one is in charge of basic construction, and he is also responsible for leading the overall work, and in fact, he rarely spends time on basic construction matters. Therefore, many problems in basic construction cannot be solved in time. The basic construction agency has weak strength. There are many assistant engineers and above in the production department, but the leading cadres of the plant are reluctant to transfer cadres from the production department to strengthen the work of the basic construction department. When preparing the 1951 plan, the leadership let things go, did not actively organize forces, and did not strengthen leadership. The opinions put forward by the various production departments were included in the plan regardless of their importance or whether they were correct. This is the main reason why the construction projects are complicated and chaotic. After the plan was prepared, it was hastily reported to the higher authorities without review. The leadership did not try to resolve the contradictions between the Basic Construction Department and the production departments. It is only natural that this will lead to the failure of the basic construction plan.

The leading cadres of the Southwest Steel Administration Bureau and the plant, on the one hand, are unwilling to work hard to lead the basic construction work of the 101 Plant, and on the other hand, they have ideas such as "get on the horse and run" and "do it first and then talk about it." They only see the urgent needs of production, but do not consider that basic construction is a long-term plan. Under the guidance of these ideas, a series of facts that violate the basic construction procedures have occurred.

The leading cadres of the plant are satisfied with the achievements and are unwilling to face up to or even forgive the shortcomings. They adopt a liberal attitude towards the shortcomings in their work, and therefore cannot quickly improve the situation of basic construction work.

### 西南工业部钢铁管理局等有关部门  检查一零一钢铁厂基本建设

　　西南工业部钢铁管理局等有关部门
    检查一零一钢铁厂基本建设
    重庆一零一钢铁厂一年以来的基本建设，克服了若干困难，做出了一些成绩，对提高生产起了作用；但工作中存在着严重的问题。为彻底了解该厂基本建设情况，西南军政委员会工业部、钢铁管理局、财政部等有关部门派出干部，组织检查组前往该厂检查。现在把初步检查结果分述如下：
    计划庞大，不切实际。
    该厂基本建设计划庞大不切实际。该厂曾盲目地轻率地一次一次编拟计划，先由小而大，继由大而小，后又由小而大，始终没有按照主客观条件及发展的趋势，慎重考虑究竟应该如何才切合实际。如一九五○年五月该厂所提的计划包括工程七十三项。该厂提出这个计划时没有分别轻重缓急，也没有正确地估计主观条件。计划订出后又没有组织力量求其完成。计划的项目中切合实用而又急需的很少，动工者占百分之四十；动工而能完成者仅占百分之十一强。同年七月，该厂提出第二个计划，又添了五十九个工程项目。这个计划未经最高主管机关批准，没有经费，也没有力量。五十九个工程项目中，已动工的十八项；已完工的五项，其中二项并不急需；已动工而又停工的二项，其中一项因未设计好而积压了资金二十一亿元；正在施工的八项。同年八月，该厂又提了第三个计划。在这个计划中虽然去掉了不切实际的项目，但是又添了四十四个新的，很零碎的项目，使计划更大，完成期限拖得更长。同时计划仍然未经最高主管机关批准，以致没有经费，只动工三项；其中两项又因为不需要而停工。一九五一年度的计划是比前几次的计划确是紧缩了些，新的项目只添了两个，旧的项目去了很多，但还有一百零三项。这证明该厂领导干部并没有接受过去一年中的教训，仍然没有考虑到这个庞大的计划是否需要，有无完成的力量。
    该厂制定基本建设计划时，对有关问题没有充分地考虑。如新建两座平炉，连同旧有的两座平炉，每年最少产钢×吨，需要炼钢原料×吨。在制定计划时，却没考虑这些原料从那里来。其他关于成本过高、产品种类及销售等问题，各项计划上也都没有提到。
    计划的编制没有按规定的工作程序办理。主管计划的人，对于规定的基本建设工作程序未加学习，对于计划大纲，初步设计和技术设计的意义和内容不够了解。虽然表格上规定的数字已填了，但很多重要的说明都漏掉了，真正的困难和缺点都没有说出来。初步设计在编制年度计划以前就应该拟好了，但到现在还拿不出来。其余技术设计，设计工作计划，施工工作计划，直到现在还不能送出，连工程什么时候完工也没有较确实的估计。
    设计粗糙，错误迭出。
    该厂在一九五一年度计划里，有些工程只列举设备本身的制图工作，而这些工程的全貌和相互关系却没有设计，因而引起很多错误。如烘钢炉只有一座，推钢机却做了两座，浪费资金一亿元。某部的工程只列了几项机器，而没有安装布置图。厂房至今尚未设计，机器不知放在什么地方，只好露天，积压资金两亿七千万元。下水道系统没有整个设计，只列出了总涵洞数字，但排泄水量不够，厂房曾屡被水淹。平炉厂址没有正确设计，变动两次，浪费开土石方的费用六千余万元。
    该厂大部分工程是只有部分粗糙的设计便仓促动工，以致错误和变动甚多。去年烘炉造好了，才发现没有烟囱。某厂房第一层楼板，等钢筋箱板都做好了，才发现忘了开皮带孔，又重新绘图修正。设计粗枝大叶，不认真进行调查研究，引起浪费。如确定某机器房地点时，事先未仔细勘察，利用解放前旧图草率动工。开了土石方一千三百方，打杉木桩六十多根后，才发现土质松软，不适于做车房，要另行选择地点。钢轨压直工作所需设备的种类和数量，未经计算和考虑，便决定开工，以后因制造上的困难和压直设备的能力已有富余而停工，损失约二亿元。其他因设计人员不负责任而造成的产品浪费更难一一列举。
    施工草率，材料浪费。
    该厂计划科由于没有经过周密考虑，很多应该做的工程没有做；不应该做的却做了；有的工程需要很急迫，开工后却又因缺乏人力，陷于半停顿状态。购买机器材料时常常事先没有开好规格或派定用途，以致买来后不合需要。如某次购买钢板，二分钢板多买了一倍半，三分钢板却没有买，结果把两张二分钢板叠起来当三分的用，人工材料损失共数亿元。某一机器材料买的超过需要百分之五十，积压资金二十余亿元。某种材料因买的过多，储藏得不好，被水浸蚀损坏约值四千八百万元。因为未经全部设计即行局部施工，有些机器制好了无法安装，有的机器制好了不合用，积压了许多资金。在施工上缺乏必要的制度，粗制滥造的现象也发生了很多，往往必须返工。
    在施工过程中，基本建设工作与生产工作不协调也影响了基本建设的效率。该厂基本建设处向制造部订货，从未签订合同，制造部因忙于生产，对基本建设处交货日期也不予保证。已经做好的或做好一半的机件也不好好保管，任其露天生锈，甚至遗失。外来的机件交到各工场，各工场也不肯负责保管，有的陷在污泥碎石中，有的被当作废铁捡走。某部三座煤气炉的上水盘，被别部门拆作别用，现在又要另做一套。还有些机件本厂不肯做，推到外面私营工厂做，但也无人检查。
    领导方面放任自流。
    一○一钢铁厂在基本建设工作中发生以上问题的原因，除经验缺乏、人力不足、领导机关检查不够等以外，主要是该厂领导干部忽视了基本建设工作，未认识基本建设的重大意义。该厂五个主要负责干部，只有一人领导基本建设，而且还要负责领导全面工作，实际上很少时间过问基本建设的事情。因此基本建设中的许多问题，都不能及时解决基本建设机构力量薄弱，生产部门助理工程师以上人员不少，该厂领导干部却舍不得从生产部门抽调干部加强基本建设部门工作。在编制一九五一年度计划时，领导上放任自流，不积极组织力量，不加强领导。各生产部门提出的意见，不分轻重缓急，也不看它正确与否，一律列入计划。工程项目繁杂零乱的主要原因就在这里。计划编好后，又不加以审核就草率转报上级。该厂基本建设处与生产部门的矛盾，领导上也不设法解决。这样使基本建设计划落空，是很自然的事情。
    西南钢铁管理局和该厂的领导干部，一方面不肯用力领导一○一厂的基本建设工作，一方面却存在着“骑上马就要跑”、“做了再说”等思想，只看到生产上的急需，而不考虑基本建设是百年大计。在这些思想指导下，就发生了一系列的违犯基本建设程序的事实。
    该厂领导干部满足于成绩的一面，而不肯正视甚至原谅缺点的一面，对工作中的缺点采取自由主义的态度，因而不能迅速改善基本建设工作的情况。
