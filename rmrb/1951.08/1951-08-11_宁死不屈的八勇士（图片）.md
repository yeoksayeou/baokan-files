    The Eight Brave Men Who Would Rather Die Than Surrender
    Made by Jiang Ping
    (Seven) The enemy, as usual, launched another round of artillery fire. The brave men quickly loaded their bullets, calmly sat in their fortifications, and discussed their plans to increase their merits.
    (Eight) The enemies pressed on from both sides again. Facing the enemy's attack from both flanks, the deputy platoon leader ordered his comrades to fire together when the enemy approached within twenty meters. The enemy surrounded them from three sides. Communist Party member He Chengyu jumped out of the fortifications, holding a machine gun to strike the enemy pressing in from the northwest. The remaining brave men met the enemies climbing up from other directions; the enemy did not rush up but was shot down halfway up the mountain.
    (Nine) The brave men took the opportunity to check their ammunition. None of the eight men had more than fifteen bullets, and there were only a few grenades left. Deputy Platoon Leader Li Bingqun solemnly said to his comrades: "There are not many bullets left, one bullet must take down one enemy! When we run out, we will jump off the cliff! The great Volunteer Army soldiers would rather die than surrender!"

    （七）敌人照例地又打了一阵炮。勇士们迅速装好子弹，镇静地坐在工事里，大家一面吸烟，一面谈着自己功上加功的计划。
    （八）两面的敌人又压上来了。面对着敌人的夹击，副排长命令战友，等敌人接近二十公尺时一齐开火。敌人从三面包围上来，共产党员何成玉跳出工事，端着机枪打击从西北面压过来的敌人，其余的勇士迎击从其他方向爬上来的敌人；敌人没有冲上来，被打在半山腰。
    （九）勇士们乘机检查一下弹药，八个人中没有一个人超过十五粒子弹，手榴弹也只有几颗了。李秉群副排长严肃地对战友们说：“子弹不多了，一个子弹要打倒一个敌人！打完了我们就跳崖！伟大的志愿军战士是宁死不屈的！”
