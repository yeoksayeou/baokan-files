Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok: After the Thai reactionary government's barbaric measure of "banning" mail to China was temporarily shelved due to widespread opposition from overseas Chinese, it began illegally inspecting letters between overseas Chinese and their homeland on August 4th under the "pretext" of "preventing overseas Chinese from discussing politics with their hometowns." A batch of family letters from overseas Chinese, forwarded from Hong Kong to Thailand on the 8th of this month, has been detained by the Bangkok Central Post Office and must be translated into Thai for inspection. A batch of letters mailed from Bangkok to China was also detained for inspection on the same day. Mong Ratchawong Kamphong Thongtheng, secretary to the Director-General of the Thai Post Office, revealed on the 9th that inspectors will redact or cut out sentences in overseas Chinese letters involving political matters or withhold them from delivery; and when there is suspicion about letters mailed from Thailand to China, they will be handed over to the police for investigation into the sender's activities.

Prior to this, Nai Bapachon, Assistant Minister of Transportation of Thailand, publicly announced on July 12th the implementation of a postal "embargo" against New China, which aroused righteous indignation among the vast number of overseas Chinese in Thailand. Therefore, the Thai Ministry of Transportation issued a notice on August 1st denying this and resorted to the method of illegally inspecting letters from overseas Chinese. This action by the Thai government, which infringes on the legitimate rights and interests of our compatriots to freedom of communication and is hostile to New China, continues to arouse the angry opposition of the 3.5 million of our compatriots residing in Thailand.

　　泰反动政府开始检查华侨邮件
    严重侵犯我华侨合法权益
    【新华社讯】曼谷消息：泰国反动政府“禁运”寄往中国邮件的横蛮措施在广大华侨反对下暂时搁置后，又以“防止华侨与家乡谈论政治”的“理由”，从八月四日开始非法检查华侨与祖国来往的信件。本月八日由香港转递到泰国的华侨家信一批，已由曼谷中央邮政局扣留，要一一译成泰文加以检查。从曼谷寄往中国的一批信件，亦在同一天被扣留检查。泰国邮政厅厅长秘书蒙叻差旺堪碰·通滕于九日透露：检查员将涂掉或剪掉华侨信件中涉及政治范围的语句或扣留不发；而对从泰国寄往中国的信件有所怀疑时，将把它送交警察以便侦查发信人的行动。
    在此以前，泰国交通部助理部长乃巴束曾在七月十二日公开宣布对新中国实施邮政“禁运”，引起旅泰广大华侨的义愤。因此，泰国交通部又在八月一日发出布告加以否认，并转而采取非法检查华侨信件的办法。泰国政府这种侵犯我国侨胞通信自由的合法权益，敌视新中国的行动，正继续激起侨居泰国的我国三百五十万侨胞的愤怒反对。
