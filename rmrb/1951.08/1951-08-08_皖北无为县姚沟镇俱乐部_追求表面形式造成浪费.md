    Yao溝 Town Club in Wuwei County, Northern Anhui,
    Pursues Superficial Forms, Leading to Waste
    The Yao溝 Town Club in Yao溝 District, Wuwei County, Northern Anhui, exhibits serious extravagance and waste. We hope that relevant authorities will promptly inspect and correct this.
    The Yao溝 Town Club was established in the autumn of 1949. The club staff has consistently failed to prioritize making the club a center for mass cultural and recreational activities, or using the club to conduct propaganda and education for the broad masses. Instead, they have focused solely on the superficial appearance. For example, in order to emphasize extravagance, they sent people to Wuhu City to make more than fifty club badges, costing approximately 500,000 yuan. During this year's "May Day," they performed a naval dance and made new white naval uniforms. During "June 1st" Children's Day, they felt that the waist drum team's clothes, which had been made at different times, were not fancy enough, so they made brand new clothes. The masses are very dissatisfied with this extravagance and waste, and some have commented, "This club is a den of loafers."
    The expenses of the town club are determined by a few cadres who "discuss" and then apportion them to the town's various merchants (some individual cadres also contribute money). For example, during "May Day," the town's Chamber of Commerce collected 20% of the spring business tax as club funds (a portion of which was used to pay the salaries of three teachers at the town's primary school), totaling approximately 6,000,000 yuan. For "June 1st," the town's Chamber of Commerce again collected more than 6,000,000 yuan from various merchants. This practice is also incorrect.
    I believe that at a time when the people of the entire country are increasing production and donating airplanes and cannons for the cause of resisting America and aiding Korea, such extravagance and waste by this club is completely wrong. The Yao溝 District People's Government and the Yao溝 District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which are stationed in the town, turn a blind eye to this problem, which is an irresponsible attitude towards the people. I hope that relevant authorities will conduct an inspection of this matter and guide the club to improve its work so that it can better serve the masses.

### 皖北无为县姚沟镇俱乐部  追求表面形式造成浪费

    皖北无为县姚沟镇俱乐部
    追求表面形式造成浪费
    皖北无为县姚沟区姚沟镇俱乐部有着严重的铺张浪费现象，希望有关机关即予检查纠正。
    姚沟镇俱乐部是一九四九年秋天成立的。俱乐部工作人员一直不重视怎样使俱乐部成为群众文化娱乐活动的中心和通过俱乐部向广大群众进行宣传教育的工作，却专门追求形式的漂亮。如他们为了讲究排场，派人到芜湖市去作了俱乐部证章五十多枚，约费钱五十万元。在今年“五一”时他们跳海军舞，现作的白色海军制服。在“六一”儿童节时，他们认为腰鼓队的衣服是陆续作的，穿着不够讲究，又作了崭新的衣服。群众对他们这种铺张浪费的行为很不满意，有的就反映说：“这个俱乐部是二流子场所。”
    该镇俱乐部的费用，是由少数干部“研究”后向该镇各商号摊派的（个别干部也有出钱的）。如“五一”时，该镇商会就按照春季营业税额附收百分之二十作俱乐部经费（内中有一部分作该镇小学三位教师的工资），共收了六百万元左右；“六一”该镇商会又向各商号收了六百余万元。这种做法也是不对的。
    我认为，在全国人民正为抗美援朝而增加生产捐献飞机大炮的时候，该俱乐部这样铺张浪费，是完全错误的。姚沟区人民政府及中共姚沟区委员会驻在该镇，对这个问题熟视无睹，也是对人民不负责任的态度。希望有关机关对此进行检查，并指导该俱乐部改进工作，使他们更好地为群众服务。
