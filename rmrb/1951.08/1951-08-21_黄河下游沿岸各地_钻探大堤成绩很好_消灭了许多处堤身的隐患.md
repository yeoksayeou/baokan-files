　　Various Areas Along the Lower Reaches of the Yellow River
    Good Results from Drilling Dikes
    Many Hidden Dangers in the Dike Body Eliminated
    Since late June, the flood control agencies of Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, under the leadership of the Yellow River Flood Control Committee, have successively mobilized more than 2,000 technicians and riveters, combined with a large number of local laborers, to conduct drilling work to inspect dikes and eliminate hidden dangers in the dike body (that is, using iron drills or iron pliers to insert into the dike body for drilling, and then pouring water into the drilled hole. If the water seeps quickly, it proves that the dike body is not solid or has holes). Henan Province started drilling work on June 25 and basically completed it by the end of July. A total of 170 kilometers of dikes were drilled, with a total of more than 1.92 million holes drilled, discovering more than 5,200 caves and excavating and filling 27,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Pingyuan and Shandong provinces are still carrying out this work. Before carrying out this work, the masses in various areas along the river had insufficient understanding of the drilling work to inspect the dikes. For example, they said, "The dikes are built so well, and the dams are so solid, how can they open up?" But after this period of drilling work, cadres and the masses have a new understanding. For example, in the Kaifeng section of Henan, everyone did not pay much attention to this work before drilling. During drilling, 1,985 holes were drilled in a 37-kilometer-long section of the dike, some of which had a diameter of 7 cun to 1 meter. In the old confluence of Ba Jiubao in the Zhongmu section, it was found that the internal caves and cracks of the dike body were like lotus roots. On the dike within 100 meters of Fujiawo, Zhang Pan, and Mazhuang in Shandong, 53 badger holes were found, and the dike was like a hornet's nest. In the Chenqiao section of Fengqiu in Pingyuan Province, an extra-large badger hole was also drilled, with five branches and six prongs in the hole, and there were signs that half of the dike had been flooded in 1949. After focusing on drilling and discovering the above-mentioned serious hidden dangers, the contempt for drilling work and the paralyzing thoughts of the masses and cadres along the river have been changed. In the future, we should also widely publicize and promote this experience of drilling dikes, eliminate the hidden dangers that are invisible on the surface of the dike body, and lay a solid foundation for overcoming floods.

　　黄河下游沿岸各地
    钻探大堤成绩很好
    消灭了许多处堤身的隐患
    自六月下旬以来，黄河下游河南、平原、山东三省的防汛机关，在黄河防汛委员会领导下，已先后动员技工、铆工二千余人，结合当地广大民工，投入检查堤防、消灭堤身隐患的钻探工作（即以铁钻或铁钳等器械插入堤身钻探，然后在钻成的洞里灌水，如果水渗漏很快，即证明该处堤身不固或有洞穴）。河南省从六月二十五日开始进行钻探工作，至七月底已基本完工。计经钻探的堤身共长一百七十公里，共钻眼一百九十二万多个，发现洞穴五千二百余处，挖填土方两万七千公方。平原、山东两省目前仍在进行这一工作。各地在开展这一工作前，沿河各地群众对检查堤防进行钻探工作认识是不足的。如说：“大堤修的这么好，坝修的这么结实，那里还会开口子？”但经过这一段钻探工作，干部和群众均有了新的认识。如河南开封段在钻探前大家对这一工作很不重视，钻探时在三十七公里长的一段堤上就钻探出了一千九百八十五个洞，其中有的洞直径竟达七公寸至一公尺。在中牟段八九堡老合龙处发现堤身内部洞穴、裂缝如藕孔一般。山东傅家窝及张潘、马庄一百公尺内的大堤上发现五十三个獾洞，大堤好像蚂蜂窝。平原省封邱陈桥段还钻探出特大獾洞，洞中分五股六槎，并有迹象表明一九四九年半个大堤都灌进了水。经过重点钻探并发现上述严重隐患后，转变了沿河群众和干部的轻视钻探工作和麻痹思想。今后还应普遍宣传推广这种钻探大堤的经验，消灭堤身表面上看不见的祸害，为战胜洪水打下坚固基础。
