　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd. The Tibetan People's Regiment of the Kangding Military Subdistrict, Xikang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, was officially established on August 1st, Army Day, by order. All commanders and fighters of the regiment felt infinite honor and excitement, and wrote a letter to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, expressing their determination to study hard and be good soldiers. The letter stated: "We, the comrades of the Tibetan People's Regiment, hereby swear to you and the people of the whole country that we will continue to expand and consolidate this armed force of the Tibetan people themselves, making it the backbone of the people's armed forces for the future construction of the Tibetan Autonomous Region. We will resolutely eliminate special agents and bandits in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, protect the interests of the Tibetan people, defend the motherland, and strive to learn military affairs, politics, and culture, improve our political consciousness, learn all the systems and traditions of the People's Liberation Army, conscientiously implement all policies and decrees under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and actively participate in various production and construction undertakings in the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Every comrade is willing to be your good soldier."

　　Note: This armed force of the Tibetan people was organized with the help of the People's Liberation Army at the request of all representatives of all ethnic groups in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province at the People's Representatives Conference last November. After more than half a year of military and political education, the political level of all commanders and fighters has been greatly improved. They unanimously requested to be formally incorporated into the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, the Xikang Military Region issued an order to formally incorporate the unit into the Tibetan People's Regiment of the Kangding Military Subdistrict.
