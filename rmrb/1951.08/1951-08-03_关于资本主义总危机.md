　　On the General Crisis of Capitalism
    A. Leontiev

    Editor's note: Two readers of the Soviet newspaper "Pravda," I. Paiypkin and M. Vasilyev (Snovosubkov City, Bryansk Province), wrote to the newspaper asking: What is the general crisis of capitalism? This article by Leontiev is the answer to this question.

    The period of the general crisis of capitalism is the entire era of the demise of the capitalist system and the victory of the new socialist system. There is a comprehensive and profound analysis of the general crisis of capitalism in the works of Lenin and Stalin. The works included in Volumes 12 and 13 of Stalin's Collected Works contain particularly important principles explaining the general crisis of capitalism.

    Comrade Stalin, in creatively developing Lenin's doctrine on imperialism and summarizing new historical experience, created the theory of the general crisis of capitalism, revealing its essence and characteristics.

    Comrade Stalin gave a classic definition of the essence of the general crisis of capitalism in his report to the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1930. When explaining the characteristics of the world economic crisis that began in 1929, Comrade Stalin said:

    "The current economic crisis is expanding on the basis of the general crisis of capitalism, which occurred during the period of the imperialist war, eroding the foundations of capitalism and promoting the arrival of the economic crisis.

    What does this mean?

    First, it means that the imperialist war and its consequences have strengthened the decay of capitalism and destroyed the balance of capitalism, meaning that we are now in an era of wars and revolutions, meaning that capitalism is no longer a unique and all-encompassing world economic system, meaning that besides the capitalist economic system, there is also a socialist system that is growing and prospering, opposing the capitalist system, demonstrating the decay of capitalism by its very existence, and shaking its foundations.

    Secondly, it means that the imperialist war and the victory of the Soviet revolution have shaken the foundations of imperialism in the colonies and dependent countries, meaning that the prestige of imperialism in these countries has been undermined, meaning that it can no longer rule these countries as before.

    Thirdly, it means that during the war and post-war periods, young domestic capitalism has emerged and grown in the colonies and dependent countries, and this capitalism is successfully competing with the old capitalist countries in the market, making the struggle for sales markets more acute and complicated.

    Finally, it means that the war has left a heavy legacy for the majority of capitalist countries, namely the existence of enterprises with production capacity that cannot be fully utilized and the existence of tens of millions of unemployed people, who have changed from a reserve army to a standing army of the unemployed. This situation had already created many difficulties for capitalism before this economic crisis, and it has complicated matters even more during the crisis." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Vol. 12, pp. 246-247)

    From this, it can be seen that in the era of the general crisis of capitalism, all the contradictions of capitalist society are extremely intensified. The division of the world into two opposing systems, capitalist and socialist, is the basic feature of the general crisis of capitalism.

    After the Second World War, the characteristic of the development of imperialism lies in the further deepening and sharpening of the general crisis of capitalism.

    Lenin creatively developed Marxism under new historical conditions and made a profound analysis of imperialism, considering it to be the highest stage of capitalism. He pointed out that imperialism is decaying and dying capitalism, the eve of socialist revolution. Lenin discovered the law of uneven economic and political development of capitalism in the era of imperialism and came to a brilliant conclusion: the victory of socialism is possible first in a single capitalist country.

    The new and complete theory of socialist revolution created by Lenin and developed by Stalin unfolded the revolutionary prospects for the proletariat in individual countries and promoted their initiative in the cause of attacking the bourgeoisie in their own countries. Lenin and Stalin's theory that socialism can be victorious in one country enriched Marxism and raised the question of the nature of the demise of capitalism in a concrete and practical form. The period of the demise of the capitalist system (i.e., the successive separation of individual countries from the capitalist system due to socialist revolutions) is also the era of the general crisis of capitalism.

    The factors of the general crisis of capitalism accumulated along with the growth of various contradictions in the monopoly stage of capitalism. The First World War of 1914-1918 was a destructive outbreak of these contradictions. Comrade Stalin said in his historically significant speech on February 9, 1946: "Marxists have repeatedly said that the capitalist world economic system contains the factors of general crisis and military conflict..." (Stalin: "Speech at the Second Voters' Meeting in the Stalin Electoral District of Moscow City," Chinese edition, p. 17)

    The war of 1914-1918 showed that the development of modern world capitalism is not smooth and balanced, but through multiple crises and wars caused by the imperialist struggle to re-divide the world that has already been divided.

    Comrade Stalin wrote: "The war was a reflection of the general crisis of capitalism, and the war itself aggravated this crisis, weakening world capitalism. The Russian workers and the Bolshevik Party were the first in the world to successfully utilize the weakness of capitalism, break through the imperialist front, overthrow the Tsar, and establish the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies." ("A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)". Chinese edition, p. 224)

    The Great October Socialist Revolution marked the fundamental transformation in the history of mankind from the old capitalist world to the new socialist world. This revolution broke through the front of world imperialism, enabling the proletariat to seize power in a major capitalist country, thus opening up the era of proletarian revolution in imperialist countries. At the same time, the October Revolution struck the rear of imperialism and shook its rule in the colonies and dependent countries. Thus, it opened up the era of colonial revolution led by the proletariat in the world's oppressed countries.

    The world's first socialist country, by the very fact of its existence, revolutionized the world. It united the proletarians of capitalist countries and the oppressed people of colonies and dependent countries into a revolutionary united front against imperialism.

    The separation of a large country from the world imperialist system gave the entire capitalism a fatal wound that could never be healed. Comrade Stalin pointed out that under the conditions of the general crisis, "capitalism, whether in the basic countries or in the colonies and dependent countries, has no and cannot have the kind of strength and stability it had before the Great War and the October Revolution..." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Vol. 13, p. 285 or "Problems of Leninism," Chinese edition, p. 564)

    The era of capitalist "stability" is over. The era of the demise of capitalism has arrived.

    The victory of Soviet socialism has in fact proved to the world the false fabrications of bourgeois polemicists who say that the division of society into exploiters and the exploited is inevitable, and that the exploited seem to be indispensable to the exploiters. It proves that capitalism is not the only possible form of social existence, and that the working class can lead the national economy and the entire social life without the bourgeoisie and against the bourgeoisie.

    The division of the world into two camps – the capitalist camp and the socialist camp, the coexistence and struggle of the two systems, has already acquired decisive significance in world history.

    Lenin and Stalin taught us that the peaceful coexistence of the two systems is entirely possible.

    The Soviet people firmly believe in the superiority of the socialist system, which is higher than the capitalist system. They advocate the peaceful coexistence of the two systems and advocate peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism in the economic field. The historical competition between the socialist system and the capitalist system at every stage increasingly demonstrates the advantages of socialism, showing that socialism is the most progressive and highest social system compared to the declining capitalist system.

    The characteristic of the general crisis of capitalism lies in the deepening of the decay of the capitalist system.

    Comrade Stalin, in defining the basic contradiction of monopoly capitalism, pointed out: "From an economic point of view, the disputes and military conflicts between the various capitalist groups today, like the struggle between the proletariat and the capitalist class, are based on the conflict between the current productive forces and the national and imperialist scope of the development of this productive force, as well as the forms of capitalist possession. The scope of imperialism and the forms of capitalism suppress the productive forces and prevent them from developing." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Vol. 5, pp. 109-110)

    The basic contradictions of capitalism – between productive forces and production relations, between the public nature of production and the private capitalist form of possession, between labor and capital – make it impossible for capitalism to achieve stability. In the period of 1924-1929, capitalism experienced a period of temporary and partial stability, when the "theoreticians" of the Second International and the Trotsky-Bukharin renegades insisted that the capitalist crisis had ended and the era of capitalist prosperity had arrived.

    Comrade Stalin, in exposing the enemies of the working class, irrefutably proved that the stability of capitalism has a temporary, partial, and unstable nature. Stalin pointed out: "...The general and fundamental crisis of capitalism caused by the victory of the October Revolution and the separation of the Soviet Union from the world capitalist system has not only not been eliminated, but on the contrary, has been deepening, shaking the very foundation of the existence of world capitalism." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Vol. 10, p. 285)

    In 1927, Comrade Stalin pointed out in his report to the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) that the deepest and most acute crisis of world capitalism is growing out of the stability of capitalism. This crisis breeds new wars and threatens the existence of any kind of stability.

    The course of history has fully confirmed this brilliant scientific prediction. At the end of 1929, an economic crisis broke out, which was the deepest and most acute of all the crises that had shaken the capitalist system. This crisis most powerfully hit the major capitalist country – the United States. It raged in various capitalist countries for four years, bringing disaster and bankruptcy to millions of workers. The economic crisis of 1929-1933 intensified the contradictions of the capitalist system to an unprecedented degree and ended the temporary stability of capitalism.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out that under the conditions of the general crisis of capitalism, periodic crises of overproduction become more frequent, the role of these crises becomes more destructive, and the intervals between the two crises become shorter.

    After the end of the economic crisis of 1929-1933, Comrade Stalin gave a Marxist explanation of the new economic phenomenon – the special depression following this crisis: this depression will not lead to a new upsurge and prosperity of industry as before. Everyone knows that a new economic crisis began again in 1937.

    Under the conditions of the general crisis of capitalism, the strengthening of capitalist decay is prominently manifested in the significant slowdown in the economic development speed of capitalist countries, and during the long period of crises and depressions, there has been an absolute reduction in output. For twenty-five years (from 1913 to 1938), the industries of the major capitalist countries continued to remain around the 1913 level, exceeding this level by a total of only 20% to 30%.

    The decay of the capitalist economic system is particularly significant when compared with the great economic victories of Soviet socialism. In 1940, the output of Soviet large-scale industry increased almost twenty times compared with the 1913 level.

    The following table of industrial output changes over the past twenty years provides a concrete idea of the fundamental differences in the economic development of the two systems:

      1929    1933    1937  1946  1949
Soviet Union    100      201.6    428.9  466.4  862.0
United States    100      64.9      102.7  154.5  159.5
United Kingdom    100      86.1      123.7  111.2  142.0
France    100     77.4      81.7    69.0    90.3

    In 1934, at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Comrade Stalin said when discussing the economic development of capitalist countries and the Soviet Union, "...In this storm of economic shocks and military-political disasters, the Soviet Union stands firm, continuing its cause of socialist construction and fighting for peace." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Vol. 13, p. 283 or "Problems of Leninism," Chinese edition, p. 563)

    The subsequent course of historical development confirmed this economic law revealed by Comrade Stalin. It is enough to recall the following facts: In the summary of the implementation of the first post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan, the output of Soviet industry in 1950 increased by 73% compared with the pre-war level of 1940, although the Soviet national economy had suffered huge losses due to the war and enemy occupation. The industrial output of the major modern capitalist country – the United States – in 1950 was much lower than the level of 1943, although military orders increased greatly and a blatant arms race was underway.

    Stalin's works pointed out the characteristics of the capitalist economy under the conditions of the general crisis of capitalism, "At this time, the industry of capitalist countries inherited an inheritance from the imperialist war that could never be shaken off, namely the phenomenon that the production capacity of enterprises could not be fully utilized and the phenomenon of tens of millions of unemployed people." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Vol. 13, p. 285 or "Problems of Leninism," Chinese edition, p. 565)

    The existence of enterprises with production capacity that cannot be fully utilized and the existence of tens of millions of unemployed people (these unemployed people have changed from a reserve army of unemployed to a standing army of unemployed) are the consequences of the following factors: the scope of capitalist exploitation has shrunk due to Russia's separation from the imperialist system, the imperialist positions in the colonies and dependent countries have been destroyed, and the domestic markets of capitalist countries have shrunk due to the further strengthening of the absolute and relative impoverishment of the working masses.

    Under the conditions of the general crisis of capitalism, one of the most prominent features of the strengthened capitalist decay is the unprecedented growth of the parasitic nature of the exploiting classes and the bourgeois state, that is, the growth of the unproductive expenses of the bourgeoisie and its parasites, the growth of militarism and the arms race, and the expansion of the scope of unproductive labor by reducing the scope of productive labor. The increasing parasitic expenditure is realized by strengthening the exploitation of the working masses, which leads to the reduction of the demand within the ability of the working masses to pay.

    During the interwar period between the two world wars, one-third to one-half of the production capacity of the industries of the basic capitalist countries could not be utilized for many years, and the situation was even worse in some sectors. After the Second World War, the United States massively eliminated production capacity, especially in those sectors that worked for peaceful needs. These sectors suffered huge underloads.

    Under the conditions of the general crisis of capitalism, millions of laborers have become redundant not only during economic crises, but also during inter-crisis periods. In the years between the First and Second World Wars, one-quarter to one-third of all workers in countries like Britain and Germany were unemployed. In the years after the Second World War, such a situation could also be seen in the United States, where the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed fluctuated between ten million and twenty million in the post-war years. According to the calculations of American bourgeois statistician E. Lubin (which are undoubtedly reduced), as a result of unemployment, the United States lost 43 million man-years (note) in just nine years (from 1929 to 1938), and the loss of wages from 1930 to 1936 was equal to a huge amount – 120 billion US dollars. This is how brutally the capitalist system wastes the main social productive forces.

    In the period of the general crisis of capitalism, what happens at the same time as the decay of the economy is the strengthening of reaction in the political aspect. The transformation from bourgeois democracy to reaction, and the domination of reaction in all social and political life, is the characteristic of imperialism. The reactionary nature of bourgeois rule is expressed more clearly and takes the most heinous forms. Fascism is the most tyrannical form of rampant reaction.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out that fascism is a product of the general crisis of capitalism, a blatant terrorist dictatorship of the most aggressive elements of financial capital.

    Comrade Stalin said at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "...Not only should the victory of fascism in Germany be seen as a sign of the weakness of the working class and the result of the social democratic party's betrayal of the working class by cleaning up for fascism. It must also be seen as a sign of the weakness of the bourgeoisie, which shows that the bourgeoisie can no longer exercise rule by the old parliamentary and bourgeois democratic methods, and therefore they have to adopt terrorist management methods in domestic policy; it shows that the bourgeoisie can no longer find a way out of the status quo with peaceful foreign policy, and therefore they have to adopt a policy of war." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Vol. 13, pp. 293-294 or "Problems of Leninism," Chinese edition, p. 572)

    Comrade Stalin's exposure of the bandit nature of fascism was of great significance to the victory of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War. Armed with Stalin's invincible science, the Soviet people eliminated the main sources of fascism in Europe and Asia, thus saving human civilization from the fascist bandits.

    The most disastrous manifestation of the various contradictions of the capitalist system is the most destructive imperialist war that bets on the survival of the people. Comrade Stalin said: "Capitalism in the stage of imperialism is a system that considers war to be a legal method of resolving international contradictions, which is legal in essence, though not in law."

    The entire course of historical events in the general crisis of capitalism has confirmed this estimate. The twenty years between the First and Second World Wars were filled with constant armed conflicts and wars of various sizes.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out that the Second World War, like the First World War, was the inevitable result of the development of world economic and political forces on the basis of modern monopoly capitalism. The first crisis in the capitalist world economic system produced the First World War, and the second crisis produced the Second World War.

    The crisis of the capitalist world economic system is a violent destruction of the state of equilibrium within the world capitalist system.

    Comrade Stalin instructed in his speech on February 9, 1946: "Originally, the imbalance in the development of various capitalist countries usually leads to the violent destruction of the state of equilibrium within the capitalist world system after a considerable period of time, and those capitalist countries that believe that they do not have sufficient raw material producing areas and sales markets usually attempt to change the status quo and re-divide the 'spheres of influence' by means of force in order to benefit themselves. The result is the division of the capitalist world into two opposing camps, and they wage war against each other." (Stalin: "Speech at the Second Voters' Meeting in the Stalin Electoral District of Moscow City," Chinese edition, pp. 17-18)

    Comrade Stalin's exposition of the principle of the crisis of the capitalist world economic system further enriched Marxist economic theory and historical science.

    The Second World War, like the First World War, resulted in the absolute weakening of capitalism. The relationship of the balance of power between the two camps (the imperialist camp and the democratic anti-imperialist camp) has undergone a fundamental change in favor of socialism. The power of the Soviet Union has grown, and its prestige on the international stage has greatly increased. The summary of the implementation of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan again proved to the world the great superiority of the socialist economic system, which is particularly significant against the backdrop of the further decay of the capitalist economy.

    The victory of people's democracy in many countries in Central and Southeastern Europe, the historically significant victory of the great Chinese people over the forces of imperialism and feudal reaction, and the establishment of the peace-loving German Democratic Republic opened up new and huge cracks in the world imperialist system.

    The Second World War was a consequence of the law of uneven economic and political development of capitalist countries in the era of imperialism, and it further sharpened this imbalance, resulting in the further strengthening of the instability of the entire imperialist system.

    Even during the interwar period between the two major wars, American imperialism was the main financial exploiter of all nationalities. After the Second World War, American imperialism, which became even fatter by the bloodshed and sacrifice of millions of people, not only became the fortress of world reaction, the main oppressor of all nationalities, and the basic embodiment of the danger of war, but also became the most important source of corruption in the entire imperialist system. The economic and political expansion of American imperialism is bound to cause the sharpening of various contradictions within the capitalist camp and the growth of popular resistance.

    The insane arms race in the United States and Western European countries in the North Atlantic aggressive alliance has created a wartime inflationary situation, which is bound to lead to new economic shocks. The militarization of the capitalist economy has caused the increasing decline in the living standards of the masses, the rise in prices and the reduction of real wages, the increase in the number of unemployed due to the shrinking of peaceful production sectors, and the sharpening of the raw material problem and the struggle for raw material producing areas. The one-sided development of the military industrial sector has put capitalist countries in front of an insurmountable contradiction and is preparing for a new economic crisis.

    As a result of the Second World War, the crisis of the imperialist colonial system has intensified unprecedentedly. The great victory of the Chinese people is a clear proof of the change in the relationship of the balance of power between the imperialist camp and the anti-imperialist camp on the international stage, and it has opened a new page in the history of the Asian nationalities oppressed by the imperialists. The liberation struggles of the people of Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaya and Burma, the upsurge of the anti-imperialist struggle in many countries in the Near East and Middle East, and in the African colonies, the growth of progressive forces in various dependent countries in Latin America – all of this shows that the imperialist colonial rear is currently disintegrating.

    The internal and external economic and political contradictions of capitalism have reached extreme intensification. The imperialist bourgeoisie is finding a way out by attacking the living rights of workers, fascistizing the state system, and launching a new world war.

    The worker movements in various capitalist countries and the national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries have gained increasingly wide-ranging scale. Leading the proletarian movement in capitalist countries are the growing and strengthening communist parties armed with Marxist-Leninist theory. Under the leadership of the communist parties, the unity of the working class fighting against capitalist slavery and for peace, democracy and socialism is becoming increasingly strengthened.

    The bourgeoisie is using the traitors of the right-wing social parties in the struggle to maintain its rule. These traitors, under the cover of the rhetoric of democracy and socialism, try to conceal the bandit nature of imperialist policy. The right-wing socialists betray the interests of the working masses and carry out the dirtiest orders of the capitalist monopoly groups. They betray the national interests of all nationalities and advocate abandoning national sovereignty and succumbing to aggressive American imperialism. The capitalist lackeys of the right-wing socialists attempt to save the dying bourgeois system with the deceptive rhetoric of democracy and socialism. The right-wing socialists pander to their imperialist masters, slander the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and all progressive forces. They serve the dark schemes of fascistizing the political life of capitalist countries and preparing a new world war.

    The massive plans for a new world war drawn up by the American and British imperialists have been met with increasing resistance from millions of people around the world. A belief is growing among millions of good people in the world: if all nationalities take the cause of maintaining peace into their own hands and defend peace to the end, then peace will be maintained and consolidated.

### 关于资本主义总危机

　　关于资本主义总危机
    阿·列昂节夫
    编者按：苏联《真理报》的读者伊·派普金和马·瓦西里叶夫（布良斯克省斯诺沃寿布科夫城）二人曾致函该报，问：什么是资本主义总危机？列昂节夫的此文，即是解答这个问题的。
    资本主义总危机的时期是资本主义制度灭亡和新的社会主义制度胜利的整个时代。在列宁与斯大林的著作中有对于资本主义总危机的全面而深刻的分析。在斯大林全集第十二卷和第十三卷所收入的一些作品内，包含有说明资本主义总危机的特别重要的原理。
    斯大林同志在创造性地发展列宁关于帝国主义的学说，概括新的历史经验时，创立了资本主义总危机的理论，揭示了它的实质和特点。
    斯大林同志一九三○年在联共（布）第十六次代表大会上的报告中，给资本主义总危机的实质下了一个经典的定义。斯大林同志在说明开始于一九二九年的世界经济危机的特点时，曾说道：
    “目前的经济危机是在资本主义总危机的基础上扩展起来的，这种总危机还在帝国主义战争时期就已经发生了，它侵蚀着资本主义的基础，并促进了经济危机的到来。
    这表示什么呢？
    首先，这就是表示，帝国主义战争及其后果加强了资本主义的腐朽，并破坏了资本主义的平衡，表示我们现在正处在战争和革命的时代，表示资本主义已经不是一种唯一的和包罗一切的世界经济体系，表示现时除资本主义经济体系外，还有社会主义的体系存在，这种社会主义的体系正在成长、繁荣，与资本主义体系相对立，以自己存在的事实本身表明资本主义的腐朽，并动摇着它的基础。
    其次，这就是表示，帝国主义战争和苏联革命的胜利动摇了帝国主义在殖民地和附属国的基础，表示帝国主义在这些国家里的威信已被破坏，表示它在这些国家里再不能照旧统治下去了。
    再次，这就是表示，战争时期和战后时期在殖民地和附属国内，出现了并成长了自己本国的年青的资本主义，这种资本主义在市场上与老资本主义国家顺利地竞争，使争夺销售市场的斗争更加尖锐而复杂起来。
    最后，这就是表示，战争给多数资本主义国家留下了沉重的遗产，即是企业中生产能力经常不能全部利用和数千万人失业现象的存在，这些失业者已由后备军变成了失业常备军，这种情形还在此次经济危机以前，就给资本主义造成了很多困难，而在危机时期，就使事情更加复杂起来了。”（斯大林全集，俄文版，第十二卷，第二四六——二四七页）
    由此可见，在资本主义总危机的时代，资本主义社会的一切矛盾极端加剧起来。世界之分裂为资本主义的与社会主义的两个对立体系，乃是资本主义总危机的基本特征。
    在第二次世界战争以后，帝国主义发展的特点就在于资本主义总危机的更进一步的深刻化和尖锐化。
              ×                ×                ×
    列宁在新的历史条件下创造性地发展了马克思主义，对帝国主义作了一个深刻的分析，认为它是资本主义的最高阶段，他指明帝国主义是腐朽、垂死的资本主义，是社会主义革命的前夜。列宁发现了帝国主义时代资本主义经济政治发展的不平衡规律，并得出了一个天才的结论：社会主义首先在单独一个资本主义国家内的胜利是可能的。
    列宁所创立、斯大林所向前发展了的新的完备的社会主义革命论，在个别国家无产阶级面前展开了革命的前途，发扬了他们在向本国资产阶级进击的事业中的主动性。列宁、斯大林的社会主义可能在一个国家内胜利的理论，丰富了马克思主义，以具体而实际的形式提出了资本主义灭亡的性质的问题。资本主义体系灭亡（即个别国家由于社会主义革命而相续脱离资本主义体系）的时期，也就是资本主义总危机的时代。
    资本主义总危机的因素是随着资本主义垄断阶段各种矛盾的增长而一道积聚起来的。一九一四——一九一八年第一次世界战争就是这些矛盾的毁灭性的爆发。斯大林同志在其一九四六年二月九日具有历史意义的演说中说道：“马克思主义者屡次说过，资本主义的世界经济体系，包藏有总危机和军事冲突的因素……”（斯大林：“在莫斯科城斯大林选区两次选民大会上的演说。”，中文版，第十七页）
    一九一四——一九一八年的战争表明了，现代世界资本主义的发展，并不是顺利而平衡地进行的，而是通过多次危机和战祸进行的，这些危机和战祸是因帝国主义为重新分割已被瓜分完毕的世界的斗争而引起的。
    斯大林同志写道：“战争原是资本主义总危机的反映，而战争本身又加剧了这个危机，削弱了世界资本主义。俄国工人和布尔什维克党在世界上最先顺利地利用了资本主义的弱点，冲破了帝国主义战线，推翻了沙皇，并建立了工兵代表苏维埃。”（“联共（布）党史简明教程”。中文版，第二二四页）
    伟大的十月社会主义革命表明了全世界人类史中由资本主义旧世界进到社会主义新世界的根本转变。这个革命冲破了世界帝国主义的战线，使无产阶级在一个最大的资本主义国家内掌握了政权，因而开辟了帝国主义国家内无产阶级革命的时代。同时十月革命打击了帝国主义的后方，震撼了它在各殖民地与附属国内的统治。因而它开辟了世界被压迫国家内在无产阶级领导下进行殖民地革命的时代。
    世界上第一个社会主义国家以自己存在的事实本身，使世界革命化起来，它把资本主义各国的无产者和殖民地、附属国的被压迫人民团结成为一个反对帝国主义的革命统一战线。
    一个极大国家的脱离世界帝国主义体系，给了整个资本主义一个永远再不能治好的致命伤。斯大林同志指示说，在总危机的条件下，“资本主义无论在各基本国家或在各殖民地与附属国家内，都已没有而且也不能有它在大战和十月革命以前所有过的那种力量和稳固性了……。”（斯大林全集，俄文版，第十三卷，第二八五页或“列宁主义问题”，中文版，第五六四页）
    资本主义“稳固”的纪元已经过去了。资本主义灭亡的纪元已经到来了。
    苏联社会主义的胜利在事实上向全世界证明了资产阶级论客们说什么社会分成为剥削者与被剥削者是不可避免的，说什么被剥削者似乎非有剥削者不行这些捏造的虚伪。证明了：资本主义不是社会存在唯一可能的形式，工人阶级能够不要资产阶级并反对着资产阶级来领导国民经济和全部社会生活。
    世界之分裂为两个阵营——资本主义阵营与社会主义阵营，两个体系的共存和斗争，在世界史上已经获得了决定的意义。
    列宁与斯大林教导我们说，两个体系的和平共存是完全可能的。
    苏联人民坚信较资本主义制度为高的社会主义制度的优越性，他们主张两个体系的和平共存，主张社会主义与资本主义在经济方面进行和平竞赛。社会主义体系与资本主义体系之间在每一个阶段上的历史性的竞赛，愈益显著地表明了社会主义的各种优点，表明了社会主义较之衰颓的资本主义体系，乃是最进步和最高的社会制度。
    资本主义总危机的特点就在于资本主义体系的腐朽性之日益加深。
    斯大林同志在给垄断资本主义的基本矛盾下定义时，指示说：“从经济观点看来，今日各资本主义集团彼此之间的争执与军事冲突，正像无产阶级与资本家阶级的斗争一样，其基础就是目前生产力与这个生产力发展的民族的和帝国主义的范围之间以及与资本主义占有形式之间的冲突。帝国主义的范围与资本主义的形式压抑着生产力、不让它发展起来。”（斯大林全集，俄文版，第五卷，第一○九——一一○页）
    资本主义的基本矛盾——生产力与生产关系之间，生产的公共性质与私人资本主义占有形式之间、劳资之间——使资本主义不可能得到稳定。在一九二四——一九二九年的时期，资本主义曾经历了一个暂时的局部的稳定时期，那时第二国际的“理论家们”和托洛茨基—布哈林辈叛卖者们硬说，资本主义危机已经结束了，资本主义繁荣的纪元已经到来了。
    斯大林同志在揭露工人阶级的敌人时，曾无可反驳地证明了，资本主义的稳定具有暂时的、局部的、不牢固的性质。斯大林指示说：“……由于十月革命的胜利和苏联之脱离世界资本主义体系而造成的资本主义的一般的和基本的危机，不仅没有被消除，而且相反的，却日益加深起来，动摇着世界资本主义存在的基础本身。”（斯大林全集，俄文版，第十卷，第二八五页）
    一九二七年，斯大林同志在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上的报告中指出，由资本主义的稳定中正在增长起世界资本主义的最深刻和最尖锐的危机，这种危机孕育着新的战争并威胁着任何一种稳定的存在。
    历史的进程完全证实了这一天才的科学预见。一九二九年底，曾爆发了经济危机，这次危机在一切曾经震动资本主义体系的危机中，是最深刻和最尖锐的一次。这次危机最有力地打击了资本主义的主要国家——美国。它在各资本主义国家里猖獗了四年，给千百万劳动者带来灾难和破产。一九二九——一九三三年的经济危机使资本主义体系的矛盾空前未有地加剧起来，结束了资本主义的暂时稳定。
    斯大林同志指明了，在资本主义总危机的条件下，周期性的生产过剩危机日益频繁，这些危机的作用变得更具有无比的破坏性，两次危机间的间歇期变得更短了。
    在一九二九——一九三三年的经济危机结束以后，斯大林同志对于新的经济现象——继这次危机而来的特种萧条，作了一个马克思主义的说明：这种萧条不会像从前一样，引向工业的新的高涨和繁荣。大家都知道，在一九三七年又开始了新的经济危机。
    在资本主义总危机的条件下，资本主义腐朽的加强突出地表现在资本主义各国经济发展速度的显著缓慢上，并且在危机和萧条的长久时期内，发生了出产量的绝对缩减。二十五年来（从一九一三年到一九三八年），各主要资本主义国家里的工业都是继续留在一九一三年水平左右，共总不过超过这个水平百分之二○到百分之三○而已。
    资本主义经济体系的腐朽情形，和苏联社会主义的伟大的经济上的胜利比较一下，就表现得特别显著了。一九四○年，苏联大工业产量比一九一三年水平几乎增加到二十倍。
    下面一个二十年来工业产量变动表，对于两个体系经济发展的根本区别，提供了一个具体的观念：
      一九二九年    一九三三年    一九三七年  一九四六年  一九四九年苏联    一○○      二○一·六    四二八·九  四六六·四
  八六二·○美国    一○○      六四·九      一○二·七  一五四·五
  一五九·五英国    一○○      八六·一      一二三·七  一一一·二  一四二·○法国    一○○  
    七七·四      八一·七    六九·○    九○·三
    一九三四年在联共（布）第十七次代表大会上，斯大林同志在论述资本主义各国和苏联的经济发展时说，“……在这种经济震动和军事政治灾变的狂风大浪中，苏联却似中流砥柱，巍然屹立，继续进行其社会主义建设并为维护和平而奋斗的事业。”（斯大林全集，俄文版，第十三卷，第二八三页或“列宁主义问题”，中文版，第五六三页）
    后来历史发展的进程证实了斯大林同志所揭示的这个经济规律。只要回想一下以下的事实就够了：第一个战后斯大林五年计划执行总结中，苏联工业一九五○年的出产额比战前一九四○年的水平增加了百分之七十三，虽然苏联国民经济由于战争和敌人的占领而遭受过巨大的损失。而现代资本主义主要国家——美国的一九五○年的工业产量，却大大低于一九四三年的水平，虽然军事定货大大增加并进行着肆无忌惮的军备竞赛。
    斯大林的著作中，曾经指明了资本主义总危机条件下资本主义经济的特点，“此时资本主义各国工业由帝国主义战争方面承受了一种再也无法摆脱的遗产，即企业中生产能力经常不能全部利用和数千万人失业的现象。”（斯大林全集，俄文版，第十三卷，第二八五页或“列宁主义问题”，中文版，第五六五页）
    企业中生产能力经常不能全部利用和数千万人失业现象的存在（这些失业者已由失业后备军变成了失业常备军），是下列一些因素所造成的后果：资本主义剥削范围由于俄国之脱离帝国主义体系而缩小，帝国主义在殖民地与附属国内阵地的被破坏，以及资本主义各国国内市场由于劳动群众绝对与相对贫困化的进一步加强而缩小。
    在资本主义总危机的条件下，业经加强的资本主义腐朽性的最显著的特征之一，就是：剥削阶级和资产阶级国家的寄生性之空前未有的增长，即资产阶级及其寄生虫非生产费用的增长、军国主义和军备竞赛的增长、以及靠缩小生产劳动范围来扩大非生产劳动范围等。日益增长的寄生开支是靠加强对劳动群众的剥削来实现的，这就引起劳动群众支付能力所及的需求的缩减。
    在两次世界战争的间歇期内，各基本资本主义国家的工业，有三分之一到二分之一的生产能力在许多年内不能被利用，而若干部门的情形更其厉害。在第二次世界战争以后，美国曾大规模地消灭生产能力，特别在那些为和平需要而工作的部门里面。这些部门感受着巨大的负荷不足。
    在资本主义总危机的条件下，千百万劳动力，不仅在经济危机时期内成了多余的，而且在危机的间歇期内也成了多余的。在第一次与第二次世界战争之间的诸年内，像英国与德国这样的国家里，全体工人的四分之一到三分之一都是没有工作的。在第二次世界战争以后的诸年内，这样的情形在美国也可以看得到，在那里，战后几年间失业与半失业的人数摇摆于一千万到二千万之间。根据美国资产阶级统计学家依·留宾的计算（无疑地是缩小了的），由于失业的结果，仅在九年内（从一九二九年到一九三八年为止），美国就失去了四千三百万人年（注），而一九三○年至一九三六年工资的损失，等于一个庞大的数额——一千二百亿美元。资本主义制度就是这样残暴地浪费着主要的社会生产力的。
    在资本主义总危机的时期内，与经济的腐朽同时发生的，是政治方面反动的加强。由资产阶级的民主转变为反动，以及反动在一切社会政治生活方面的统治，就是帝国主义的特点。资产阶级统治的反动性质表现得更明确，采取了最可恶的形式。法西斯主义就是反动猖獗的最横暴的形式。
    斯大林同志指明了，法西斯主义是资本主义总危机的产物，是财政资本最具侵略性的分子的公开的恐怖专政。
    斯大林同志在联共（布）第十七次代表大会上说：“……不仅要把法西斯主义在德国的胜利看作是工人阶级力量软弱的征候和替法西斯主义当清道夫的社会民主党叛变工人阶级的结果。同时还须把它看作是资产阶级力量软弱的征候，它表明资产阶级已不能用旧的国会制的和资产阶级民主制的方法来实行统治了，因之，他们不得不在对内政策上采用恐怖主义的管理方法；它表明资产阶级再不能用和平对外政策来找到摆脱现状的出路了，因之他们不得不采用战争的政策。”（斯大林全集，俄文版，第十三卷，第二九三——二九四页或“列宁主义问题”，中文版，第五七二页）
    斯大林同志之对法西斯主义强盗本性的揭露，对于苏联人民在伟大卫国战争中的胜利，是具有巨大意义的。为斯大林的战无不胜的科学所武装起来的苏联人民，消灭了欧、亚两洲法西斯主义的主要策源地，因而从法西斯主义匪徒之下挽救了人类文明。
    资本主义体系各种矛盾的最具灾难性的表现，就是拿人民的生存作孤注一掷的最具破坏性的帝国主义战争。斯大林同志说：“帝国主义阶段上的资本主义乃是这样一种制度，它认为战争是解决国际矛盾的合法方法，这种方法虽不是在法律上，但是在实质上是合法的。”
    资本主义总危机时期的历史事件的全部进程证实了这一估计。第一次与第二次世界战争之间的二十年曾充满了不断的武装冲突和各种规模的战争。
    斯大林同志指明了，第二次世界战争，也如同第一次世界战争一样，乃是现代垄断资本主义基础上的世界经济与政治力量发展的必然结果，资本主义世界经济体系第一次危机的结果产生了第一次世界战争，而第二次危机的结果便产生了第二次世界战争。
    资本主义世界经济体系的危机是世界资本主义体系内部均势状态的猛烈破坏。
    斯大林同志在一九四六年二月九日的演说中指示说：“原来，各资本主义国家发展的不平衡性，通常是经过相当时期便要引起世界资本主义体系内部均势状态的猛烈破坏，并且那些认为自己没有充分原料产地和销售市场的资本主义国家，通常是企图用武力的手段来改变现状，重新分割“势力范围”，以求有利于己。结果便是资本主义世界之分裂为两个敌对阵营，而互相进行战争。”（斯大林：“在莫斯科城斯大林选区两次选民大会上的演说”，中文版，第十七——十八页）
    斯大林同志所阐明的关于资本主义世界经济体系危机的原理，进一步丰富了马克思主义的经济理论和历史科学。
    第二次世界战争，如同第一次世界战争一样，其后果是资本主义的绝对削弱。两个阵营（帝国主义阵营与民主的反帝国主义阵营）之间的力量对比关系，发生了有利于社会主义的根本变化。苏联的威力增长了，它在国际舞台上的威信大大增高了。战后斯大林五年计划执行的总结又向全世界证明了社会主义经济体系的伟大优越性，这种优越性在资本主义经济进一步腐朽的衬托下表现得特别显著。
    中欧与东南欧许多国家里人民民主的胜利，伟大的中国人民对于帝国主义势力及封建反动势力的具有历史意义的胜利，以及爱好和平的德意志民主共和国的成立，在世界帝国主义体系上打开了新的巨大裂口。
    第二次世界战争乃是帝国主义时代资本主义各国经济政治发展不平衡规律发生作用之后果，它又引起了这一不平衡性的进一步尖锐化，结果全部帝国主义体系的不稳定性更其加强了。
    还在两次大战之间的时期内，美帝国主义就是各族人民的主要的财政剥削者。第二次世界战争以后，靠千百万人流血和牺牲生命而更其肥胖起来的美帝国主义，不仅成了世界反动的堡垒，各族人民的主要压迫者，战争危险的基本体现者，而且也成了全部帝国主义体系腐败的最重要的策源地。美帝国主义的经济与政治的扩张，必然要造成资本主义阵营内各种矛盾的尖锐化和人民大众反抗的增长。
    美国以及北大西洋侵略联盟内西欧各国的疯狂的军备竞赛，造成战时通货膨胀的情势，这种情势必然要引向新的经济震动。资本主义经济的军国主义化引起群众生活水平的日益低落、物价的上涨和实际工资的降低、由于和平生产部门的缩小而引起失业人数的增加、以及原料问题和为争夺原料产地而斗争的尖锐化。军事工业部门的片面发展使资本主义各国处于不可解决的矛盾之前并准备着新的经济危机。
    由于第二次世界战争的结果，帝国主义的殖民地体系的危机空前加剧起来了。中国人民的伟大胜利，乃是国际舞台上帝国主义阵营和反帝国主义阵营之间力量对比关系变化的明显证明，它揭开了受帝国主义者压迫的亚洲各族人民历史上的新的一页。越南、印度尼西亚、马来亚和缅甸人民的解放斗争，近东与中东许多国家内以及非洲殖民地内的反帝国主义斗争的高涨，拉丁美洲各附属国内进步力量的增长——所有这一切表明帝国主义的殖民地后方目前正在分崩离析。
    资本主义的内部的及外部的经济政治的矛盾达到了极端的尖锐化。帝国主义资产阶级正以向劳动者生活权利的进攻、国家制度的法西斯化和发动新的世界战争来找寻出路。
    各资本主义国家的工人运动和殖民地、半殖民地的民族解放运动获得了日益广泛的规模。领导资本主义国家内无产阶级运动的，是以马克思列宁主义理论武装起来的日益成长和壮大的共产党。在共产党的领导下，为反对资本主义奴隶制和争取和平、民主与社会主义而斗争的工人阶级的统一变得日益强固起来。
    资产阶级在为了保持自己统治的斗争中利用着右翼社会党的叛徒们，这些叛徒在民主与社会主义词藻的掩饰下，力图隐瞒帝国主义政策的强盗实质。右翼社会党人背叛劳动群众的利益，执行着资本主义垄断集团的最肮脏的命令。他们背叛各族人民的民族利益，鼓吹放弃国家主权和屈从侵略的美帝国主义。右翼社会党的资本主义走狗们企图用民主与社会主义的欺人鬼话来挽救垂死的资产阶级制度。右翼社会党人逢迎他们的帝国主义主子们，诽谤苏联、人民民主国家和一切进步力量。他们效劳于资本主义国家政治生活法西斯化和准备新的世界战争的黑暗勾当。
    美、英帝国主义者所拟定的新的世界战争的庞大计划，遭到全世界千百万人的日益加强的反抗。在世界各国千百万善良人们中间，正在增长着一个信念：如果各族人民把保持和平的事业掌握在自己手中，并将和平捍卫到底，那末和平就会保持和巩固。
