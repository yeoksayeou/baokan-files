　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th. Hong Kong's industry and commerce have suffered a great crisis under the so-called "embargo" by U.S. imperialism and the dumping of American-financed Japanese goods. The phenomenon of production contraction, factory closures, and worker unemployment in Hong Kong due to the U.S. "embargo" causing a lack of industrial raw materials has become extremely serious. The Hong Kong Labour Office, in its recently published gazette, admitted that due to "a great shortage of certain raw materials" and Hong Kong industrial products having "high prices and a lack of sales," Hong Kong industry has fallen into recession, and the number of unemployed workers has reached 24,500. According to statistics from Hong Kong trade unions, most of Hong Kong's textile industry is now shut down or partially shut down, with more than 10,000 workers unemployed. Of more than 110 underwear factories, only three are partially open, with more than 4,000 workers unemployed. The rubber industry has more than 5,000 workers unemployed or partially unemployed. Enamelware production has been reduced by nearly half, and a large number of workers are unemployed. Recently, hardware manufacturing has also seen continuous factory closures, with more than 1,000 workers unemployed. Hong Kong trade unions pointed out that Hong Kong industry is rapidly declining, not only because of the U.S. imperialism's "embargo" but also because of the large-scale dumping of Japanese goods controlled by American capital in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong, which is hitting Hong Kong's industry and commerce. According to statistics for the first half of this year, Hong Kong's trade deficit with Japan was 25 million U.S. dollars, and Japanese goods' competition in Hong Kong is forcing many British goods to be sold at reduced prices. Many shops in Hong Kong are holding "liquidation sales" in preparation for closing down.

　　在美国“禁运”和日货倾销打击下
    香港经济危机严重
     工厂纷纷停闭失业工人数目激增
    【新华社广州二十七日电】在美帝国主义所谓“禁运”和美资日货倾销打击下的香港工商业已遭到极大的危机。香港因美国“禁运”致缺乏工业原料而产生的生产萎缩、工厂停闭、工人失业的现象现已极为严重。香港劳工处在最近发表的公报中承认：由于“若干原料大为缺市”和香港工业品“价格昂贵，销埸缺乏”，香港工业陷于萧条，失业工人已达二万四千五百人。据香港工会方面统计，现在香港的纺织业已大部停工或半停工，失业工人超过一万人。内衣业一百一十余家工厂现在半开工者仅有三家，失业工人达四千余人。树胶业已有五千余工人失业或半失业。搪瓷业生产已减缩将近一半，大批工人失业。五金制造业最近也不断有工厂停闭，失业工人已达千余人。香港工会指出：香港工业正在迅速地衰落，除了美帝国主义“禁运”外，还由于美国资本控制下的日本货物在东南亚和香港大量倾销，打击香港工商业。据今年上半年统计，香港对日贸易入超为二千五百万美元，日货在香港的竞争迫使许多英国货要降价出售。在香港的许多商店都在“清盘拍卖”，准备歇业。
