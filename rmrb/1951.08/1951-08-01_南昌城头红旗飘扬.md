　　Red Flag Flying Over Nanchang
　　After the spring of 1927, the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, openly betrayed the revolution and colluded with imperialism and feudal forces, carrying out large-scale, extremely savage and cruel massacres of Chinese Communists, revolutionary workers, peasants, and intellectuals. The whole country was suddenly plunged into darkness.
　　However, in the face of the extremely cruel massacres by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Chinese Communists and the revolutionary people of China, except for those who were passive and wavering, were not intimidated. At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong and many other leading comrades of the Party always adhered to the correct revolutionary line, resolutely supported the peasant revolution, and advocated establishing workers' and peasants' revolutionary armed forces to oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' attack on the revolution. They continued to hold high the banner of revolution and led the Chinese people to launch a heroic struggle.
　　At this moment, on August 1, 1927, a major event occurred in Nanchang, Jiangxi. Communists Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Ye Ting, He Long, and other comrades led a part of the Northern Expeditionary Army under the influence of the Communist Party and launched an uprising. This is the famous Nanchang Uprising. The troops participating in the uprising included the Ninth Army led by Comrade Zhu De, the Twentieth Army led by Comrade He Long, the Eleventh Army led by Comrade Ye Ting, and a part of the Fourth Army, totaling more than 30,000 people. The uprising was launched at one o'clock in the morning on August 1, attacking the Kuomintang reactionary army Zhu Peide's Third Army. From the beginning to the end of the battle, it took only three hours to completely eliminate the counter-revolutionary army in Nanchang.
　　The Nanchang Uprising was the beginning of the Chinese Communist Party's independent creation of people's armed forces.
　　After the Nanchang Uprising, many uprisings broke out one after another under the call of the Party. In mid-August, there were peasant uprisings in Puqi, Xianning, Chongyang, and other places in Hubei. In September, peasants, workers, and a part of the Northern Expeditionary Army in various counties on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, held the famous Autumn Harvest Uprising, which once occupied the area of Pingjiang, Liuyang, Pingxiang, Liling, and Zhuzhou. In October, peasants in Haifeng and Lufeng, Guangdong, under the leadership of Comrade Peng Pai, launched an uprising, occupied the county towns of Haifeng and Lufeng, and formed a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army of more than 10,000 people. In December, workers and revolutionary troops in Guangzhou launched an uprising. The armed forces formed in these uprisings were the foundation of the later Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, which is also the earliest foundation of the current Chinese People's Liberation Army.
　　In the history of creating the Chinese People's Army, the meeting of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhu De in Jinggangshan was the most important key. In October 1927, Comrade Mao Zedong led the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army of the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan to the Jinggangshan area on the border of Jiangxi and Hunan, where he established a workers' and peasants' democratic government, led peasants to distribute land, and began to establish the first revolutionary base area. The Nanchang Uprising troops, due to lack of experience in leadership, did not quickly integrate with the peasant movement in Jiangxi, and withdrew from Nanchang on August 5, heading for Guangdong. Under the pressure of the superior forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the uprising army suffered setbacks in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas of Guangdong. Therefore, a part of the troops transferred to Haifeng and Lufeng and joined forces with the local uprising peasant armed forces; another part, under the leadership of Comrade Zhu De, retreated to Jiangxi, transferred to Hunan, launched the Hunan peasant uprising, and expanded the troops. In April 1928, this troop, under the leadership of Comrades Zhu De, Chen Yi, Lin Biao, etc., went to Jinggangshan and joined forces with the troops led by Comrade Mao Zedong, forming the Fourth Army of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. This meeting combined an uprising force with a force that grew out of the mass struggle and, under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, gradually formed a new type of people's army most closely connected with the people. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought, this army quickly created its own set of strategies and tactics and formed its own complete set of army-building principles and systems. Because this army was under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought from its very beginning, it was able to continuously overcome various errors, withstand serious setbacks, and overcome all difficulties in more than 20 years of arduous struggle, growing from small to large and from weak to strong, becoming an invincible force.
　　After the Jinggangshan meeting, the Red Army's strength was strengthened, and the revolutionary base area centered on Jiangxi gradually expanded and consolidated. The Second Civil Revolutionary War in China, that is, the Land Revolution War, has since developed more vigorously.

　　南昌城头红旗飘扬
    一九二七年的春天以后，国民党反动派，以蒋介石为首，公开叛变了革命，与帝国主义、封建势力勾结在一起，对中国共产党人、革命的工人、农民和知识分子，实行了大规模的极其野蛮残酷的屠杀，全国顿时陷于暗无天日的状态。
    但是，在国民党反动派极端残酷的屠杀面前，除了消极动摇分子以外的中国共产党人和中国革命的人民并没有被吓倒。当时，毛泽东同志，以及其他许多党的领导同志始终坚持正确的革命路线，坚决拥护农民革命，主张建立工农革命武装，来反对国民党反动派对革命的进攻。他们继续高举革命的大旗，领导中国人民展开英勇的战斗。
    就在这时，在一九二七年八月一日，江西南昌城发生了一件大事。共产党人周恩来、朱德、叶挺、贺龙等同志，率领在共产党影响下的一部分北伐军，举行了起义。这就是有名的南昌起义。参加起义的部队，有朱德同志领导的第九军，贺龙同志领导的第二十军，叶挺同志领导的第十一军和第四军一部，共有三万多人。起义在八月一日的早晨一点钟发动，向国民党反动军队朱培德第三军进攻，从开始到战斗结束，仅仅三小时，就把南昌反革命军队完全消灭。
    南昌起义，是中国共产党独立创造人民武装的开始。
    南昌起义以后，在党的号召下，接连地爆发了很多起义。八月中旬，有湖北蒲圻、咸宁、崇阳等地农民的起义。九月，湖南、江西边境各县农民、工人和一部分北伐军，在毛泽东同志领导下，举行著名的秋收起义，这次起义曾经占领了平江、浏阳、萍乡、醴陵、株州一带。十月，广东海丰、陆丰农民，在彭湃同志领导下起义，占领了海丰、陆丰等县城，组成了一万多人的工农红军。十二月，广州市工人和革命军队举行了起义。在这些起义当中组成的武装部队，就是以后工农红军的基础，也就是现在中国人民解放军的最早的基础。
    在创立中国人民军队的历史当中，毛泽东同志和朱德同志在井冈山的会师，是最重要的关键。一九二七年十月，毛泽东同志率领湖南秋收起义的工农革命军，到达江西、湖南边界的井冈山地区，在那里建立了工农民主政权，领导农民分配土地，着手建立第一个革命根据地。南昌起义的部队，由于领导方面缺乏经验，没有很快与江西的农民运动结合，于八月五日退出南昌，向广东出发，在国民党反动派优势力量的压迫下，起义军在广东的潮州汕头地区遭受了挫折。于是，一部分转进到海丰、陆丰，与当地起义农民武装会合；另一部分在朱德同志领导下，退到江西，转入湖南，发动了湖南农民起义，扩大了部队，到一九二八年四月，这支部队在朱德、陈毅、林彪等同志率领下，到井冈山和毛泽东同志领导的部队会师，成立了工农红军第四军。这次会师，使一个起义部队和一个从群众斗争中生长起来的部队结合起来，并得到毛泽东同志的直接领导，就逐渐形成了一支新型的与人民联系最密切的人民的军队。这支军队在毛泽东同志的军事思想指导下，很快就创造出自己一套战略、战术，形成自己整套建军原则和制度。这支军队因为从它一开始产生就在毛泽东同志军事思想直接领导下，所以在二十多年的艰苦斗争中，能够不断克服各种错误，能经得起严重挫折，战胜了一切困难，从小到大，从弱到强，成为无敌的力量。
    井冈山会师以后，红军力量加强了，以江西为中心的革命根据地也逐步扩大和巩固。中国的第二次国内革命战争，也就是土地革命战争，从此更加蓬勃发展起来。（据总政新闻处稿，略有修改。）
