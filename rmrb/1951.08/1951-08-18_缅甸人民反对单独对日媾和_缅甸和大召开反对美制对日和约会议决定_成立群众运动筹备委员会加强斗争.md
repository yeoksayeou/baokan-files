　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Rangoon: The Burmese World Peace Congress invited representatives from more than 20 units, including the Burmese Labor-Farmer Party, People's Party, People's Peace Front, Dobama Asiayone, and workers, farmers, students, and women's groups, to a meeting on the 12th to discuss the issue of opposing the US-made Japanese peace treaty. The meeting was chaired by Thakin Lwin, Chairman of the Burmese Labor-Farmer Party. Thakin Lwin stated: All political parties and mass organizations that represent the interests of the people should now rise up to lead the people in opposing the US imperialists' conspiracy to conclude a separate peace with Japan. U Ba Swe, a member of the Central Committee of the Labor-Farmer Party, pointed out in his speech: The purpose of the US imperialists' separate peace with Japan is to rearm Japan to invade Asia and undermine world peace. The Burmese people, who have suffered deeply from the Japanese invaders, should resolutely rise up to oppose it.

　　U Ohn Dan, leader of the People's Front, and other party representatives then spoke successively, unanimously denouncing the US imperialists' conspiracy to conclude a separate peace with Japan.

　　The meeting finally decided to hold an enlarged meeting of various parties on the 15th to discuss the establishment of a preparatory committee for a mass movement against the US-made Japanese peace treaty. This committee will lead the Burmese people in the struggle against the US separate peace with Japan.
