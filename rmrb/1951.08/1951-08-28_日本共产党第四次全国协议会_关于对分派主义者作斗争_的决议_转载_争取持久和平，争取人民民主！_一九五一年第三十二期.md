　　The March 21st issue of the "Party Activity Guidelines" newspaper published in Tokyo carried the "Resolution on the Struggle Against Factionalists" passed by the Fourth National Congress of the Japanese Communist Party held in February this year. The full text is as follows:

　　"To complete the important and difficult tasks of our Party at present, the ideological and organizational unity of the entire Party is needed more than ever today. Without the iron-like Bolshevik discipline and rock-solid unity, the Party, as the vanguard of the working class, cannot unite the entire nation, cannot serve the people, and cannot advance the struggle against imperialism and traitors who plunge all mankind into the flames of war.

　　At this juncture, we can no longer tolerate all factionalists who internally undermine the unity of the Party and the people, and objectively help the national enemy, to continue to remain within our Party's ranks. After more than a year of arduous struggle last year, our Party and the working class have made great progress and growth. In the fierce class struggle and national struggle, the factionalists have exposed their nature in front of the masses, they have become isolated, and the hostile elements have finally clearly revealed their essence as spies.

　　Therefore, this important National Congress, equivalent to the Party Congress, unanimously decided to issue a final warning to all factionalists still remaining in the Party, as well as the middle elements who are in contact with them, demanding that they conduct thorough self-criticism and obey Party discipline. The Provisional Central Guidance Department is entrusted to take decisive measures against those who do not obey this resolution.

　　This is a class decision based on revolutionary tasks and practice. This decision will become a new starting point for arming the Party with Marxism, Leninism, and Stalinism and strengthening the Party in the future."

　　The resolution of the Fourth National Congress of the Japanese Communist Party – "On the Struggle Against Factionalists" – will undoubtedly play a significant role in strengthening and unifying the Party's ranks.

　　Maintaining the unity and discipline of the Party is the most basic obligation of all Communist Party members. Because the issue of Party unity and discipline is a matter of the Party's life and death.

　　Precisely for this reason, the factional actions of a portion of Communist Party members who disregard the interests of the Party, violate Party discipline, and undermine Party unity can only benefit the Japanese and American reactionaries. The enemies of the Japanese people are wholeheartedly hoping that the Communist Party will be weakened due to internal struggles and lose the possibility of leading the Japanese people's struggle for liberation.

　　As is well known, if there is no unity, no solidarity, and no iron discipline within the Party, and if various factionalists and splitters are allowed to move freely within the Party, then the Party cannot fulfill its lofty tasks to the people, and its activities will not have any success.

　　Of course, among the opposition, there are also many honest people who, due to a lack of understanding of the complex domestic political situation, have become victims of agitators, spies, and cunning adventurers sent by enemy special service agencies into the Party to deliberately sabotage the Party. The resolution of the National Congress is written for these honest but misguided Party members. Resolutely implementing this resolution will help unite and consolidate the Japanese Communist Party, which is selflessly fighting for the liberation of Japan from American occupation and rule.

　　日本共产党第四次全国协议会“关于对分派主义者作斗争”的决议
    转载“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五一年第三十二期
    东京出版的三月二十一日《党活动指针》报刊载了今年二月召开的日本共产党第四次全国协议会所通过的“关于对分派主义者作斗争”的决议，其全文如下：
    “为了完成我党目前重大与困难的任务，今天比任何时期更需要全党在思想上和组织上的统一。如果没有钢铁般的布尔什维克的纪律以及岩石般的坚固团结，作为工人阶级先锋队的党就不能统一全民族、不能为人民服务，不能使反对帝国主义和卖国贼将全人类投入战争火焰的斗争向前发展。
    在此时机，我们不能再容忍自内部破坏党和人民的团结、客观上帮助民族敌人的一切分派主义者继续留在我党阵营内。经过去年一年多的艰苦斗争，我党和工人阶级有了巨大发展与成长。在激烈的阶级斗争以及民族斗争中，分派主义者在群众面前已暴露其本质，他们已经孤立，敌意的分子终于明显地表露出其奸细的实质。
    因此，相当于党代表大会的本届重要的全国协议会一致决议，向尚留在党内的一切分派主义者，以及和他们有联系的中间分子发出最后的劝告，要求他们进行彻底的自我批评并服从党的纪律。委托临时中央指导部对不服从本决议的分子，采取断然措置。
    这是以革命的任务和实践为基础的阶级的决定。这个决定将成为今后以马克思、列宁、斯大林主义来武装党以及加强党的新出发点。”

    日本共产党第四次全国协议会的决议——“关于对分派主义者作斗争”——无疑地将在加强和统一党的阵营上，发生重大的作用。
    保持党的统一和纪律是所有共产党员最基本的义务。因为党的统一和纪律的问题，是党的生死存亡的问题。
    正因如此，一部分不顾党的利益、违反党的纪律、破坏党的统一的共产党员的分派行动，只能有利于日本和美国反动派。日本人民的敌人一心期望着，共产党由于内部斗争而削弱，而丧失领导日本人民的解放斗争的可能性。
    如所周知，如果党内没有统一、没有团结、没有铁的纪律，如果在党内允许各种分派主义者和分裂分子自由活动，那么党对人民就不能完成其崇高的任务，它的活动就不会有任何成功。
    当然在反对派中间，也有不少诚实的人们，他们由于不了解国内复杂的政治形势，而做了敌人特务机关派进党内故意破坏党的煽动者、奸细以及狡猾的冒险家的牺牲品。全国协议会的决议是针对这些诚实的但走错道路的党员们所写的。坚决执行这一决议，将有助于为了从美国占领统治下解放日本而忘我地斗争的日本共产党的团结和巩固。
