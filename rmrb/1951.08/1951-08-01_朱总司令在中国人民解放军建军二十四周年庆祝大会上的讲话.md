Comrades!

It has been twenty-four years since the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927. In these twenty-odd years, the Chinese people, relying on their own army, have fought against domestic and foreign enemies, promoted the cause of national independence and people's democracy, and finally overthrew the rule of imperialism and domestic reactionary forces in China, liberated the entire mainland, and won the great victory of the people's revolutionary war. This army itself has also grown from a small number of people at the beginning of the uprising to the current powerful force. This is the result of the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the result of the bloodshed and sacrifice of countless revolutionary martyrs, the result of the heroic struggle of all comrades, the result of the enthusiastic support and joint struggle of all revolutionary classes and ethnic groups across the country, and the result of the sympathy and assistance of Soviet friends and progressive people around the world. The great victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war and the development and growth of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are worthy of our deep celebration.

The People's Liberation War has been won, but we still have serious tasks. The Chinese people's enemy, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang and American imperialism, still occupy our Taiwan and have not given up their conspiracy to instigate special agent bandit activities against China and armed landings on the coast. American imperialism not only barbarously and unreasonably directly controls our Taiwan with armed forces, invaded our neighbor North Korea, and at one point advanced to the Yalu River. The American air force, until recently, has continued to carry out provocations in our Northeast China. British and American imperialism tore up international agreements and prepared to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan, absurdly depriving the People's Republic of China of the right to participate in the formulation of the treaty. American aggressors are actively arming Japan and plan to occupy Japan and southern Korea for a long time. American imperialism has repeatedly and publicly stated that it will continue to be enemies with the Chinese people and undermine the new people's democratic China. At present, ceasefire negotiations are being held between the two sides in the Korean War. If a ceasefire is achieved and there is a possibility of a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, that is naturally our consistent hope. We love peace and we demand peace in all of Asia and the world. However, we must not forget that the imperialist countries are still unwilling to make peace. American imperialism is actively preparing for a new world war of aggression in both Asia and Europe, and is still invading Korea and Chinese Taiwan. We must strive to strengthen the combat power of the People's Liberation Army, consolidate our national defense, and fight to recover Taiwan and defend the motherland.

We, the Chinese people, already have rich experience in conducting political and military struggles against imperialism and domestic reactionaries, and we must continue to increase this experience. We have a fundamental experience, that is, to deal with armed aggressors and domestic armed counter-revolutionaries, we must rely on the people's strong armed struggle forces. As long as armed aggressors and armed counter-revolutionaries exist for one day, our people's armed forces cannot be separated from the responsibility of safeguarding the people's interests for a single day.

In order to shoulder the historical task of defending the motherland and opposing imperialist aggression, the Chinese People's Liberation Army must build various services, strengthen modern technical equipment, strengthen combat training, and strengthen combat effectiveness.

Commanders, fighters, and staff at all posts of the People's Liberation Army should have a thorough understanding of imperialism and the highest vigilance, have infinite enthusiasm for defending the motherland and the people's rights and interests, have a high degree of revolutionary heroism to dedicate themselves to the just cause of the people, and have the spirit of hard struggle that is not afraid of any difficulties and can be determined to overcome difficulties, thereby maintaining a high fighting will frequently and firmly. This requires continuing to carry out political education in depth from top to bottom throughout the army, and constantly improving the level of political awareness of all personnel in the army. The high morale and excellent political qualities of the People's Liberation Army have always been a fundamental factor in defeating any enemy.

Our army now has a certain amount of new equipment and has formed various services, and we will continue to strengthen these services. The People's Liberation Army will transition from a purely army, and basically relying on infantry combat, to land, sea and air forces with various modern technical equipment, which can carry out joint operations of various services in resisting enemy aggression. This is a major historical transformation in our military history. In order to smoothly complete this transformation, our troops must actively study and improve their technology, and commanders at all levels must learn to master and use new equipment and new services. The whole army should develop an upsurge in learning and improving technology. The experience of the Chinese People's Volunteers proves that the Chinese People's Army is capable of quickly completing this transformation.

On the basis of its existing glorious traditions, on the basis of strong political and military qualities and experience in building and fighting the army, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will continue to carry forward its glorious traditions, learn advanced Soviet military science, and will surely continue to strengthen the national defense of our great motherland and strengthen the forces for defending peace. I hope that all comrades in the army will work together under the leadership of Chairman Mao and with the assistance of the broad masses of the people.

Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
Long live the organizers and leaders of the Chinese People's Liberation Army - the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao!
Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　朱总司令在中国人民解放军建军二十四周年庆祝大会上的讲话
    同志们！
    从一九二七年八月一日南昌起义到现在，已经有二十四年了。在这二十几年当中，中国人民依靠自己的军队，同国内外敌人作战，推动民族独立和人民民主事业向前发展，终于推翻了帝国主义和国内反动势力在中国的统治，解放了全国大陆，获得了人民革命战争的伟大胜利。这支军队本身，也从开始起义时期的少数人，发展成为现在的强大部队。这是中国共产党、毛主席正确领导的结果，是无数革命先烈流血牺牲的结果，是全体同志英勇奋斗的结果，是全国各革命阶级、各族人民热烈支援、共同奋斗的结果，是苏联友人和世界进步人民予以同情援助的结果。中国人民革命战争的伟大胜利，中国人民解放军的发展壮大，值得我们深深庆祝。
    人民解放战争已经胜利了，但是我们还有严重的任务。中国人民的敌人蒋介石残余匪帮和美国帝国主义，还占住我们的台湾，还没有放弃策动对中国的特务土匪活动和在沿海武装登陆的阴谋。美国帝国主义不但野蛮无理地用武装部队直接控制了我们的台湾，侵入了我们的邻邦朝鲜，并且曾经一度进到鸭绿江边。美国的空军直至最近，还在继续不断地在我国东北境内实行挑衅。美英帝国主义撕毁国际协议，准备对日本实行片面媾和，荒谬地剥夺中华人民共和国参加制订和约的权利。美国侵略者积极武装日本，并且打算长期占领日本和朝鲜南部。美国帝国主义再三地公然表示要继续与中国人民为敌，破坏人民民主的新中国。目前朝鲜战争双方正在举行停战谈判。如果停战实现，有了和平解决朝鲜问题的可能性，那自然是我们一向的希望。我们是热爱和平的，我们要求全亚洲和全世界的和平。但是，我们切不可忘记帝国主义国家至今仍然不愿意和平。美国帝国主义无论在亚洲和欧洲都在积极准备新的世界侵略战争，还在侵略着朝鲜和中国的台湾。我们必须努力加强人民解放军的战斗力量，巩固我们的国防，为收复台湾和捍卫祖国而奋斗。
    我们中国人民，已经有了对帝国主义与国内反动派进行政治斗争和军事斗争的丰富经验，我们还必须继续增长这些经验。我们有一项根本性质的经验，就是对付武装的侵略者和国内的武装反革命，必须依靠人民的坚强的武装斗争力量。只要武装的侵略者和武装的反革命存在一天，我们人民的武装力量就一天也不能够脱开保卫人民利益的职责。
    中国人民解放军为了负起保卫祖国和反对帝国主义侵略的历史任务，必须建设各个兵种，加强现代技术装备，加强作战训练，加强战斗力。
    人民解放军的指挥员、战斗员和各个岗位的工作人员，都应该有对于帝国主义的透彻认识和最高的警惕，有保卫祖国和人民权益的无限热忱，有为正义的人民事业而献身的高度革命英雄主义，有不怕任何困难而能决心克服困难的艰苦奋斗的精神，由此经常巩固地保持着高度的战斗意志。这就需要在全军中，继续由上而下深入地进行政治教育，不断地提高全军人员的政治觉悟水平。人民解放军的高昂的士气和优良的政治素质，始终是战胜任何敌人的一个根本因素。
    我们的军队现在已经有了一定数量的新式装备，已经组成了各个兵种，我们将要继续加强这些兵种。人民解放军将要由过去单纯的陆军，而且基本上是依靠步兵作战，过渡到具有各种现代技术装备的陆海空军，可以在抵抗敌人侵略时进行各兵种的联合作战。这在我们的建军史上，是一次大的历史性的转变。为了顺利地完成这个转变，我们的部队必须积极地学习和提高技术，各级指挥员必须学会善于掌握和使用新装备、新兵种。全军应该发展一个学习和提高技术的热潮。中国人民志愿军的经验证明，中国的人民军队是能够迅速地完成这个转变的。
    中国人民解放军在既有的光荣传统的基础之上，在坚强的政治素养、军事素养和建军作战经验的基础之上，继续发扬光荣传统，学习苏联先进的军事科学，将必能不断地加强我们伟大祖国的国防力量，加强捍卫和平事业的力量。希望全军同志在毛主席领导之下，在广大人民协助之下，一致努力。
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民解放军的组织者、领导者——中国共产党和毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
