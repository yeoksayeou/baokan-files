　　Resolution on Women's Propaganda and Education Work

　　Passed on July 31, 1951, at the First Propaganda and Education Work Conference of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, approved by the Standing Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation.

　　(1) Women's propaganda and education work is a crucial and indispensable part of women's work. All levels of the Democratic Women's Federation (hereinafter referred to as the Women's Federation) and its member organizations must use the full strength of the federation and mobilize all possible forces to carry it out.

　　(2) The target of women's mass propaganda and education work should include all women, with a focus on working women from the working class, peasantry, and petty bourgeoisie. In cities, the focus should be on female workers, female staff, workers' families, staff families, and other working women (including housewives) from the laboring and petty bourgeoisie. In rural areas, the focus should be on peasant women participating in major or auxiliary agricultural labor (including housework). Given that the vast majority of women in the country are currently engaged in housework and lack organization and education, or have no organization and education, the Women's Federation should use more effort to work among them, organize them, educate them, raise their political awareness, enable them to learn culture and production technology, enable them to participate in social activities and participate in production labor as much as possible.

　　(3) The content of propaganda and education work among women should include: (1) General political education. This includes education on current events and policies, New Democracy, patriotism and internationalism, and the long-term vision of socialism and communism. When conducting these educations, it is necessary to closely integrate them with the central work of the time and place, and to connect them with the ideological characteristics and personal issues of women. (2) Education on women's issues. It is necessary to publicize to women the principle that they must participate in labor production and political and social activities in order to achieve complete liberation; at the same time, education on special issues such as the Marriage Law, family democracy, maternal and child hygiene, and children's welfare should be carried out in conjunction. (3) Cultural education and technical education. The main tasks are to help illiterate women become literate, help educated women improve on their existing foundations, and help women lacking skills learn skills so that they have the conditions to participate in labor production and social work.

　　(4) Because many women are illiterate and have low cultural levels, propaganda and education among women must focus on popular content and forms. Oral propaganda should use the language of the masses as much as possible. Literary and artistic propaganda should adopt forms of expression that the masses can understand. Written propaganda should be large in font, contain many pictures, and be story-like, so that women with a slight education can easily understand it, and illiterate women can also understand it when listening. The content of these three types of propaganda must be in line with women's actual lives and related to women's personal issues, so that women can easily accept it. Among them, oral propaganda and literary and artistic propaganda are particularly welcomed by the broad masses of women and are most effective, and attention should be paid to their widespread adoption in the future.

　　(5) Women's propaganda and education work includes publicizing women's issues to women and all sectors of society, and publicizing issues of all sectors to women. Therefore, this is work that the Women's Federation should do, and it is also work that all sectors of society should do. The Women's Federation must promote joint action by all parties through publicity and through some necessary organizations and steps. It is necessary to open up the situation and be good at promoting all parties (including the Communist Party Committee, relevant departments of the People's Government, and people's organizations) to carry out women's propaganda and education work through various organizations (such as various representative meetings, various forums, literacy classes, reading groups, winter schools, civil schools, various learning organizations, etc.), using various propaganda tools (such as newspapers, magazines, pictorials, radio stations, news agencies, publishing houses, etc.) and various opportunities (such as various exhibitions, gatherings, cultural and entertainment venues, etc.). The Women's Federation should actively reflect the ideological situation of women to all parties, provide propaganda materials, and make requests, suggestions, and criticisms; and realize the responsibilities of inspection, supervision, and suggestion through female representatives participating in people's congresses and female cadres at all levels of government, especially female cadres in supervisory agencies and all opinion organs. Only in this way can women's propaganda and education work be more widely carried out.

　　(6) In view of the fact that feudal ideas and customs that hinder women's progress still exist in society and among women themselves, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological criticism work of women's propaganda and education work. It is necessary to oppose feudal ideas and customs that bind women, break the restrictions on women in many aspects, and strengthen ideological education on equality between men and women, so that women can be liberated ideologically and participate in labor production more smoothly in practice. In the past, the ideological criticism work in women's propaganda and education work was very weak. We have not boldly criticized the ideas and behaviors in society that discriminate against, restrict, or even persecute women, and the behaviors that violate the government's policies and laws on equality between men and women; we have also lacked criticism of women's own feudal ideas. This shows that the ideological and combative nature of women's propaganda and education work is very poor. In the future, we must attach importance to and vigorously carry out ideological criticism work, break the erroneous view that "women can't do anything," and establish the idea that women can do everything. At the same time, we should actively commend and encourage exemplary cases in society where equality between men and women is implemented and women's legitimate interests are protected, and women who dare to correctly struggle against old ideas.

　　For the thousands of marriage cases in various places that have resulted in women's deaths and injuries, it is necessary to focus on publicity and urge the courts to thoroughly investigate and ensure that every criminal receives due punishment.

　　(7) In the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the political awareness of the broad masses of women has been somewhat improved, and they urgently demand to learn culture and need a large number of popular readings. To this end, women's federations above the provincial and municipal levels must closely contact the local publishing industry, reflect women's demands, provide materials and suggestions, and negotiate to participate in the design of popular readings, and promote the publishing industry to supply various popular readings and textbooks suitable for women as much as possible.

　　The publishing work of the Women's Federation system should be oriented towards the masses and develop in the direction of popularization. It should plan to compile popular readings suitable for working women. The All-China Women's Federation should compile publicity materials on major events, as well as popular books on women's issues, theory, women's movement policies, women's movement history, and international women's movements, and improve the monthly magazine "New China Women" to make it more popular. The Women's Federation of the major administrative regions should compile popular readings or supplementary teaching materials suitable for workers and peasants, and the published periodicals should clarify their targets and guidelines to be popular and easy to understand. Provincial Women's Federations should make every effort to use local newspapers and periodicals to publicize women's issues and, in principle, should not publish regular periodicals. Women's Federations in large cities can publish popular publications aimed at female workers, professional women, and housewives.

　　(8) To improve the leadership of propaganda and education work. (1) Women's federations at all levels should conduct propaganda work throughout the federation, and all departments must break the idea of departmentalism. The Standing Committee meetings or ministerial meetings of the Women's Federation should regularly discuss propaganda and education work. All departments of the Women's Federation should actively promote their own business and conduct propaganda and education to the masses they regularly contact. The Propaganda and Education Department should organize various departments to conduct propaganda together. When conducting propaganda for political movements and central work, the Propaganda and Education Department should jointly discuss the propaganda plan with various departments, make unified arrangements through the Standing Committee meeting or the ministerial meeting, divide labor and cooperate, and check and summarize on time. (2) Promoting successful experiences is an important leadership method. Women's federations at all levels should regularly understand and study the problems in their work, and can adopt more circulation methods to promote successful experiences in a timely manner, so that the content and methods of women's propaganda and education work can be continuously improved and enriched. (3) Women's federations above the provincial and municipal levels should hold propaganda and education work conferences regularly to summarize experiences and solve problems in their work. The timing of the conference will be determined by the women's federations at all levels as needed.

　　(9) To continue to popularize and deepen the patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and implement the three calls of the General Association for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea. Establishing patriotic pacts is one of the main ways for the broad masses of people to carry out long-term self-education. This work should be carried out under the unified leadership of the local Anti-American Aid Korea Association. The patriotic pact should be initiated by women to establish it jointly with men in the same unit, according to the unit of work, study, and life. The scope should be small (such as workshops, production groups, study groups, courtyards, alleys, families, etc.), and it must be established through democratic discussion, consciously and voluntarily. The text should be popular, concise and easy to remember, and the content should be practical and feasible, and it can be checked on time. Attention should be paid to correcting and preventing the tendency of formalism. Women's federations should regularly understand the participation of women in the establishment and implementation of patriotic pacts, promote successful experiences, and use patriotic pacts as an important form of patriotic education for women. Women's federations must strengthen their leadership so that women who lack organization and education participate in the establishment and implementation of patriotic pacts, and continue to improve their political awareness through patriotic pacts.

　　(10) Women's propaganda and education work is a long-term and arduous task. Women's work cadres must go deep into the masses, not indulge in empty talk, be realistic and pragmatic, and do their work well. At the same time, they must strengthen the study of on-the-job cadres, establish and adhere to a study system, learn theory, business, current affairs policies, and various knowledge, and especially need to study women's issues. Only by learning diligently and assiduously, and humbly learning from the masses, can we continuously improve our theoretical, policy, and business levels, get rid of the work style of being busy with routine matters, catch up with the needs of practical work, and better serve the masses of women. On the other hand, we must pay attention to selecting on-the-job cadres and activists from the masses to participate in various learning organizations in a step-by-step manner.

　　全国妇联举行第一次宣传教育工作会议
    通过关于妇女宣传教育工作的决议
    全国民主妇女联合会第一次宣传教育工作会议已于七月三十一日闭幕。出席会议的代表有中央直属省市、大行政区直属市及各省民主妇女联合会、各民主妇女团体的宣传工作负责人共九十七名。全国妇联在京常执委、各部负责人也出席了这个会议，中国共产党中央宣传部及中央人民政府的有关部门均派人出席指导。彭真同志并向大会作了政治报告，胡乔木同志作了有关妇女宣传工作的报告。
    会上由全国民主妇联宣传教育部副部长胡耐秋作了妇女宣传教育工作几个问题的报告，由各地区妇联作了妇女宣教工作的典型报告，并经过讨论，最后由邓颖超副主席作总结。会议通过了关于妇女宣传教育工作的重要决议。决议全文如下：
    关于妇女宣传教育工作的决议
    一九五一年七月三十一日在全国民主妇联第一次宣传教育工作会议上通过，经中华全国民主妇女联合会常务委员会批准。
    （一）妇女宣传教育工作是妇女工作中一个最主要的不可缺少的部分。各级民主妇女联合会（以下简称妇联）及各会员团体必须用全会的力量并动员一切可能动员的力量去进行。
    （二）妇女群众宣传教育工作的对象，应包括全体妇女，而以工、农、小资产阶级的劳动妇女为主。在城市中，应以女工、女职员、工人家属、职员家属，以及其他劳动者和小资产阶级的劳动妇女（包括家庭劳动妇女）为主。在农村中，应以参加农业主要劳动或辅助劳动（包括家庭劳动）的农民妇女为主。鉴于目前全国妇女的绝大多数是从事家庭劳动而缺少组织和教育，或没有任何组织和教育，因此，妇联应当用更多的力量在她们中间进行工作，组织她们，教育她们，提高她们的政治觉悟，使她们学习文化和生产技术，使她们能够参加社会活动并尽可能参加生产劳动。
    （三）在妇女群众中进行宣传教育工作的内容，应包括：（１）一般的政治教育。即时事政策教育，新民主主义教育，爱国主义与国际主义的教育，和社会主义与共产主义的远景教育。进行这些教育时，都应当密切结合当时当地的中心工作，联系妇女的思想特点和切身问题。（２）妇女问题教育。要向妇女宣传必须参加劳动生产和政治、社会活动才能获得完全解放的道理；同时，要结合进行婚姻法、家庭民主、妇婴卫生、儿童福利等特殊问题的教育。（３）文化教育和技术教育。主要的是帮助不识字的妇女识字，有文化的妇女在原有基础上提高，帮助缺少技术的妇女学习技术，使她们具备参加劳动生产和社会工作的条件。
    （四）由于妇女群众中文盲多，文化水平不高，因此在妇女群众中进行宣传教育必须着重用通俗化的内容和形式。口头宣传要多用群众的语汇。文艺宣传要采用群众能看得懂的表现形式。文字宣传要字大、图多、带故事性，使略有文化的妇女容易看得懂，不识字的妇女也能听得懂。这三种宣传的内容都要切合妇女的实际生活，联系妇女的切身问题，才能使妇女群众容易接受。其中尤以口头宣传和文艺宣传，为广大妇女群众所欢迎，效力最大，今后应注意广泛采用。
    （五）妇女宣传教育工作，包括向妇女及社会各方面宣传妇女问题和向妇女宣传各方面的问题。因此，这是妇联应做的工作，也是社会各方面应做的工作。妇联必须通过宣传，通过一些必要的组织和步骤，推动各方面共同进行。必须打开局面，善于推动各方面（包括共产党党委、人民政府的有关部门和人民团体），经过各种组织（例如各种代表会议、各种座谈会、识字班、读报组、冬学、民校、各种学习组织等），运用各种宣传工具（例如报纸、杂志、画刊、广播电台、通讯社、出版社等）和各种机会（如各种展览会、集会、文化娱乐场所等）来进行妇女宣传教育工作。妇联应该主动向各方面反映妇女的思想情况，提供宣传材料，提出要求、建议与批评；并通过参加人民代表会议的女代表及各级政府的女干部，尤其是监察机关的女干部以及一切舆论机关来实现检查、监督、建议的职责。这样才能使妇女宣传教育工作更广泛地展开。
    （六）鉴于社会上和妇女本身还存在着阻碍妇女前进的封建思想和习俗，因此必须加强妇女宣传教育工作的思想批判工作。必须反对束缚妇女的封建思想和习俗，打破在许多方面对妇女的限制，加强男女平等的思想教育，使妇女从思想上得到解放，才能从实际上更顺利地参加劳动生产。过去妇女宣传教育工作中的思想批判工作是非常薄弱的。我们对社会上歧视、束缚甚至迫害妇女的思想和行为，以及违抗政府的男女平等政策法令的行为，没有大胆地进行批判；对妇女本身的封建思想也缺少批评。这说明妇女宣传教育工作的思想性、战斗性很差。今后，必须重视和大力展开思想批判工作，打破认为“妇女一切不行”的错误观点，树立妇女一切可做的思想。同时，对社会上实行男女平等，保障妇女合法利益的模范事例，和勇于向旧思想正确地作斗争的妇女，应积极表扬和鼓励。
    对于各地造成妇女死伤的千百件婚姻案件，务必着重宣传，督促法院彻底追究，务使每个犯罪者都受到应有的惩办。
    （七）在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动中，广大妇女群众的政治觉悟已有一些提高，迫切要求学习文化，并需要大量的通俗读物。为此省市以上妇联必须和当地出版界密切联系，反映妇女的要求，提供材料和建议，并商定参加通俗读物的设计工作，以及推动出版界尽可能供应适合妇女的各种通俗读物和课本。
    妇联系统的出版工作，应面向群众，向通俗化的方向发展，有计划地编写适合劳动妇女的通俗读物。全国妇联应编写重大事件的宣传资料，以及有关妇女问题理论、妇运政策、妇运史料和国际妇运等通俗书籍，并改进《新中国妇女》月刊，使其通俗化。大行政区妇联应编写适合工农妇女的通俗读物或补充教材，已出版的刊物，应明确对象和方针，做到通俗易懂。省妇联应尽量运用当地报纸和刊物宣传妇女问题，原则上规定不出定期刊物。大城市妇联，可出版以女工、职业妇女和家庭劳动妇女为对象的通俗刊物。
    （八）要改进宣传教育工作的领导。（１）各级妇联应全会做宣传工作，各部门必须打破本位主义的思想。妇联的常委会议或部长会议应经常讨论宣传教育工作。妇联各部应主动宣传本部门的业务，并对经常联系的群众进行宣传教育。宣传教育部应组织各部共同进行宣传。在进行政治运动和中心工作的宣传时，宣传教育部应和各部共同商定宣传计划，经过常委会议或部长会议统一布置，分工合作，按时检查总结。（２）推广成功的经验是重要的领导方法。各级妇联应经常了解并研究工作中的问题，可多采用通报的方法以便及时推广成功的经验，使妇女宣传教育工作的内容和方法，不断改进和丰富。（３）省市以上妇联应定期召开宣传教育工作会议，总结经验，解决工作中的问题。召开会议时间依需要由各级妇联自行决定。
    （九）要继续普及深入抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，贯彻抗美援朝总会的三项号召。订立爱国公约是广大人民进行长期自我教育的主要方式之一。这项工作，应在各地抗美援朝会统一领导下进行。订立爱国公约，应发动妇女按工作、学习、生活的单位与同单位的男子共同订立。范围要小（如车间、生产小组、学习小组、大院、里弄、家庭等），必需经过民主讨论，自觉自愿的订立，文字要通俗，简明易记，内容要切实可行，并可按时检查，应注意纠正和防止形式主义的偏向。妇联应经常了解妇女参加订立和执行爱国公约的情况，推广成功的经验，把爱国公约作为对妇女进行爱国主义教育的重要形式。妇联必须加强领导，使那些缺少组织和教育的妇女参加订立和执行爱国公约，通过爱国公约，继续提高她们的政治觉悟。
    （十）妇女宣传教育工作是一种长期的艰巨的工作。妇女工作干部必须深入群众，不尚空谈，实事求是，作好工作。同时必须加强在职干部的学习，建立与坚持学习制度，学习理论、业务、时事政策和各种知识，尤其需要研习妇女问题。只有认真地学，刻苦地学，并虚心地向群众学习，才能不断提高理论、政策和业务水平，摆脱事务主义的作风，赶上实际工作的需要，更好地为妇女群众服务。另一方面必须注意有步骤地选送在职干部与群众中的积极分子，参加各种学习的组织。
