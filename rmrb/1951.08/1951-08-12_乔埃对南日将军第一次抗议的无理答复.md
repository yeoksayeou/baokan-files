　　Joye's Unreasonable Reply to General Nam Il's First Protest
    General Joye's reply to General Nam Il's first protest is as follows: "Your letter has been received. Your accusation in the letter that one of your vehicles was attacked by air in Sipyong-ni - about twenty-five miles northeast of Kaesong - is completely unfounded. On July 8th, Colonel Kinney, Chief Liaison Officer of the United Nations Command, verbally notified Colonel Chang, your Chief Liaison Officer, that vehicles serving your delegation in Kaesong could be free from attack if you notified the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces of the route and time of these vehicles in advance and painted clearly identifiable white markings on these vehicles. In addition, Colonel Kinney, Chief Liaison Officer of the United Nations Command, also gave Colonel Chang, the Communist Chief Liaison Officer, a written notice identical to the aforementioned verbal notice. I now quote a passage from Colonel Kinney's notice to the Communist Liaison Officer on July 8th:
    'Communist motorcades with white cross markings will not be attacked by United Nations forces when traveling to and from Kaesong according to the time and route notified to the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces.'
    Later, you did notify the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces of the time and route of your motorcade to Kaesong on July 9th, indicating that you understood the necessity of notification. Furthermore, on July 21st, Colonel Kinney again notified Colonel Chang that notifying the time and route of your vehicles traveling between Pyongyang and Kaesong was a necessary condition for avoiding attack. Colonel Chang said that it was difficult to issue such notices every time, which again indicates that he understood the necessity of issuing notices. Colonel Kinney later notified Colonel Chang a third time that without such notification, immunity from attack could not be guaranteed. You are, of course, aware that your liaison station in Kaesong and the United Nations Command south of the Imjin River are in constant contact.
    I note that the location of the attack you mentioned is quite far east of the main road between Pyongyang and Kaesong. This situation makes me suspect that your troops are abusing the white markings for purposes other than serving your delegation.
    As for Colonel Chang's report to Colonel Kinney on August 8th regarding the incident that occurred in Panmunjom on August 7th, I note that you delayed the report by more than twenty-four hours. Therefore, a timely investigation is impossible. However, I am now giving this matter due consideration.
                                                  Joye"

### 乔埃对南日将军第一次抗议的无理答复

　　乔埃对南日将军第一次抗议的无理答复
    按乔埃将军对南日将军第一次抗议的答复如下：“你们的来信收到了。你们在信里指责说你方的一辆车辆在市边里——开城东北二十五英里左右——遭受空袭，这种指责是完全不能成立的。七月八日，联合国军司令部首席联络官肯尼上校曾口头通知你方首席联络官张上校说，为在开城的你方代表团服务的车辆可以不受袭击，如果你方事前把这些车辆的通行路线和时间通知联合国军总司令，并在这些车辆上涂绘清晰可辨的白色标志的话。此外，联合国军司令部首席联络官肯尼上校还给了共产党首席联络官张上校与上述口头通知内容相同的书面通知，现在我引用肯尼上校在七月八日送给张上校的致共产党联络官通知书中的一段话：
    ‘涂有白十字标志的共产党汽车队按照通知联合国军司令官的时间和路线往返于开城途中，可以不受联合国军队的袭击。’
    后来你方确曾把你方汽车队在七月九日前往开城的时间和路线通知联合国军总司令，这表示你方了解通知的必要性。此外，七月二十一日，肯尼上校又通知张上校说，通知你方车辆在平壤和开城之间驶行的时间和路线是不受袭击的必要条件。张上校说很难每次发出这种通知，这又表示他了解有必要发出通知。肯尼上校后来第三次通知张上校说，如果没有这种通知，免受袭击是不能保证的。你方当然知道在开城的你方联络站和在临津江以南的联合国军司令部是经常保持联络的。
    我注意到你们所说的袭击地点是在平壤与开城之间的主要公路以东相当远的地方。这种情况使我怀疑你方军队是否滥用白色标志以达到为你方代表团服务以外的目的。
    至于张上校于八月八日向肯尼上校报告八月七日在板门店发生的事件，我注意到你方耽搁了二十四小时以上才发出这个报告。因此无法进行及时的调查。但是我现在正在对这个问题作适当的考虑。
                                                  乔埃”
