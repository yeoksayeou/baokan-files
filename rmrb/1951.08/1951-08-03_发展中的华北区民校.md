            Development Status

    Thanks to the winter literacy campaign combined with patriotic education for resisting America and aiding Korea, people's schools in the North China region have greatly developed. According to incomplete statistics, there are 18,417 people's schools in Pingyuan Province, with more than 678,680 students, accounting for approximately 86 percent of the total number of winter schools and 83 percent of the total number of students, an increase of about one-fold compared to last year (people's schools). In Hebei Province, there are over 713,400 students in people's schools, representing 69 percent of the number of students in winter schools last year, an increase of about one and a half times compared to last year (people's schools). Shanxi Province currently has 12,212 people's schools. According to statistics from 20 counties and one city in the province, the number of enrolled students has reached 124,194 (Taiyuan City has 96 people's schools, more than four times the number of winter schools last year). Furthermore, according to statistics from seven counties in the Yanbei Special District of Chahar Province, 1,079 winter schools have been transformed into people's schools, with more than 49,000 students, exceeding the original plan by 4,000 students.

            Several Characteristics of This Year's Development of People's Schools

    First, this year, a steady development policy has been adopted. Generally, people's schools are more standardized than last year. Students participate in learning voluntarily. Tests were conducted at the beginning of the semester, and students were divided into grades and classes according to their proficiency. Necessary systems were established (such as testing, leave requests, make-up classes, and transfers). At the same time, inspired by patriotic education for resisting America and aiding Korea, the masses actively participated in learning, making the scale of some people's schools exceed that of winter schools, and they formulated learning pacts and launched learning competitions.

    Second, leading comrades at all levels conducted timely inspections and guidance, and established a system of commendation and criticism, preventing the past phenomena of being vigorous at the beginning but slack later on. In order to transform winter schools into people's schools, full ideological mobilization was carried out beforehand, and comparisons were made from individuals to groups, models were elected, and achievements were summarized. Some used the method of "cultural bitterness" to enhance the political awareness and enthusiasm for cultural learning among the masses. Many people's school students have formulated long-term learning plans, preparing to enter worker-peasant elementary schools and worker-peasant secondary schools in the future. Many villages have also built new classrooms and added desks, chairs, and chandeliers.

    Third, people's schools combined resisting America and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries to carry out patriotic education, inspiring the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, it further promoted the consolidation and development of people's schools. For example, Zhao Bi Village in Lingqiu County, Chahar Province, originally had no winter school. After the education of resisting America and aiding Korea, two people's schools, one for men and one for women, were established, with 443 people regularly participating in learning. Another example is that the number of people's schools in the Xinxiang Special District of Pingyuan Province exceeded the number of winter schools, which was also the result of the movement to resist America and aid Korea and patriotic education.

    Fourth, when winter schools were transformed into people's schools, leading comrades grasped the characteristics of the production season and appropriately changed the organizational form and leadership methods. After democratic discussion, the study time for groups was also stipulated. Some areas (such as Xinhe Village in Wutai County, Shanxi Province) have developed specific plans for combining year-round learning with production, unifying learning and production, so as to ensure that neither production nor learning is neglected. This has ensured the consolidation and development of people's schools.

            Issues That Should Be Paid Attention to in the Future

    In the future, people's schools should seek development in consolidation and strive to persist for a long time. Therefore, first of all, it is necessary to improve the quality of teachers. For example, in the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province, the level of mass teachers is not high, with those below the primary school level accounting for 80 percent. In Pinggu County, Hebei Province, out of 195 winter schools, there are only three mass teachers, and the others are concurrently held by primary school teachers. If this continues, it will affect the persistence and consolidation of people's schools. The solution is to organize volunteer teachers, learn first and then teach, learn while teaching; or try to establish transmission stations, designate special personnel (such as the principal of the people's school or the central principal, etc.) to help them, and continuously conduct inspections. It is also possible to use the slack farming season to conduct centralized training to gradually improve their teaching level and further implement the policy of "people teaching people."

    In some areas (old revolutionary base areas), people's schools have persisted in learning for the past two years, and some have completed four volumes of people's school textbooks. For example, in Shen County, Pingyuan Province, 800 students have reached the level of primary school graduation, and in Anyang Special District, approximately 8,000 people have completed four volumes of people's school textbooks. According to statistics from five counties in the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province, more than 7,400 students have graduated, accounting for 5.43 percent of the number of enrolled students. Therefore, the original people's schools can no longer meet their requirements, and it is not suitable for them to transfer to elementary or higher primary schools. How to enable them to continue learning is a problem that should be addressed. In areas with concentrated populations, full-time teachers can be set up to form higher primary school classes, or classes or groups can be attached to primary schools to conduct education separately.

    Although leaders in various regions have paid more attention to the implementation of the policy of prioritizing the learning of village cadres and activists, some regions have still not earnestly implemented it, which needs to be corrected urgently. For example, according to statistics from four counties in the Shijiazhuang Special District of Hebei Province, out of 28,120 village cadres and activists, only 2,191 participated in learning, accounting for 7.8 percent of the number of people who should be learning. Because they cannot take the lead in learning, it has affected the development and consolidation of local people's schools. Therefore, leaders at all levels should specifically help village cadres and activists solve the difficulties of having a lot of work, many meetings, and many concurrent positions, so that they have the opportunity to participate in learning.

　　发展中的华北区民校
    华江
            发展情况
    华北区民校由于在去年冬学运动的基础上结合了抗美援朝爱国主义教育，有了很大的发展。据不完全统计：平原已有民校一万八千四百一十七处；学员有六十七万八千六百八十余人，约占冬学总数的百分之八十六和总人数的百分之八十三，较去年增加了约一倍（民校）。河北省民校学员有七十一万三千四百余人，为去年冬学人数的百分之六十九，较去年约增加一倍半以上（民校）。山西省现有民校一万二千二百一十二处。据该省二十个县一个市的统计：入学人数达十二万四千一百九十四人（太原市有民校九十六处，为去年冬学数的四倍以上）。另据察哈尔雁北专区七个县的统计，冬学转为民校者共一千零七十九处，学员四万九千多人，超过原计划四千人。
            今年民校发展的几个特点
    第一，今年采取了稳步发展的方针。一般民校均较去年正规。学员自愿参加学习。开学时进行了测验，按程度分了年级、班次，建立了必要的制度（如测验、请假、补课、转学等）。同时在抗美援朝爱国主义教育的鼓舞下，群众积极参加学习，使部分民校的规模超过了冬学，并且制定了学习公约和展开了学习竞赛。
    第二，各级领导同志及时进行了检查、辅导，建立了通报表扬和批评的制度，防止了过去前紧后松、虎头蛇尾的现象。为了使冬学转为民校，事前曾作了充分的思想动员，由个人到小组进行了评比，选举模范，总结成绩。有的用“文化诉苦”的方式，提高了群众的政治觉悟和文化学习的积极性。有不少民校学员，订定长期的学习计划，准备将来进入工农速成小学和工农速成中学。还有不少村庄修盖新教室，添制桌椅、吊灯等。
    第三，民校结合抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动，进行了爱国主义教育，启发了群众的爱国热情。因而，更推动了民校的巩固和发展。例如察哈尔灵邱县赵壁村原来没有冬学，经过抗美援朝爱国主义的教育之后，建立了男女两处民校，经常参加学习的有四百四十三人；又如平原新乡专区民校数所以超过了冬学数，也是抗美援朝运动和爱国教育的结果。
    第四，在冬学转民校时，领导同志掌握了生产季节的特点，适当地变换了组织形式和领导方法。经过民主讨论以后，又规定了小组的学习时间。某些地区（如山西省五台县新河村）的学员订出常年学习与生产相结合的具体计划，将学习与生产统一起来，作到生产学习两不误。这样就保证了民校的巩固与发展。
            今后应注意的问题
    今后民校应该在巩固中求发展，争取长期坚持下去，因此，首先要提高教师质量。例如山西长治专区群众教师的程度都不高，在初小以下者占百分之八十；河北平谷县一百九十五处冬学，只有三个群众教师，其他皆由小学教师兼任。长此下去，将影响民校的坚持与巩固。解决办法，可组织义务教员，先学后教，边学边教；或试办传授站，指定专人（如民校总校长或中心校长等）帮助他们，并不断进行检查。还可以利用农闲进行集中训练，逐步提高其教学水平，进一步贯彻“民教民”的方针。
    部分地区民校（老区）近两年来，一直坚持学习，有的已教完民校四册课本。如平原省莘县有八百个学员已达到初小毕业程度，安阳专区约有八千人学完了民校四册课本。又据山西省长治专区五个县统计，毕业学员七千四百余人，占入学人数的百分之五点四三等，因此原有民校已不能满足他们的要求，如转入小学或高小学习，亦不适合他们的情况。如何使他们能继续学习，这个问题应予注意解决。人数集中的地区，可另设专职教员成立高小班，或在小学内附设班或组，单独进行教育。
    在贯彻执行村干部积极分子重点学习的方针上，各地领导同志虽较前重视，但有些地区仍没有认真执行，亟须纠正。如据河北省石家庄专区四个县的统计，二万八千一百二十个村干部和积极分子，仅有二千一百九十一人参加学习，占应学习的人数的百分之七点八。由于他们不能带头学习，影响了当地民校的发展和巩固。因此，各级领导同志应具体地帮助村干部和积极分子解决他们工作多、会议多、兼职多的困难，以便他们有参加学习的机会。
