To the Editor of the People's Daily:

The People's Daily published Comrade Guo Maowen's letter on June 22nd. This letter pointed out the facts that the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region contracted important projects to private merchants, causing workers to be illegally exploited by contractors and foremen. After seeing this letter, we immediately began to investigate and study the matter. The results of the investigation and study are explained below.

(I) The Facts of Contractor Exploitation

    1.  The matter of the private Rongju Construction Factory in Shijiazhuang contracting the mountain cave project at a certain construction site and then subcontracting it to foreman Cui Yushan is as follows: Cui Yushan is a rogue specializing in speculation and exploitation, engaging in eating, drinking, gambling, and prostitution. He used to run a teahouse in Shijiazhuang and hire singing women. When Cui Yushan contracted the project from Rongju Construction Factory, the wage was 42 jin of rice per cubic meter, but only 25 jin were issued to the workers. Cui also diverted the wage money for speculative trading, or used it for eating, drinking, gambling, and prostitution, resulting in a total of more than 4,000 jin of rice in arrears to more than 30 workers, including Sun Zhenhai. This matter was later handled by the Shijiazhuang People's Court. According to the investigation, the outstanding wages have been paid off.

    2.  The private Xinzhong Construction Factory in Shijiazhuang also had the fact of subcontracting and exploitation after contracting the mountain cave project. Han Zili, the manager of Xinzhong Construction Factory, was a landlord who had been struggled against in Pingshan County, and Shao Hongsen, the deputy manager, was a merchant from Shijiazhuang. They had neither capital nor technical experience. When contracting the mountain cave project, they pre-borrowed one-fifth of the project funds according to the contract. Not only did the contractor not use the pre-borrowed funds for the project, but they diverted part of the pre-borrowed funds to compensate for their losses in contracting housing projects in Gaocheng. Moreover, because the contractor was completely ignorant of the mountain cave project, hundreds of workers could not produce stone, and expenses were wasted greatly, resulting in arrears of more than 100,000 jin of millet to the construction site; and a lot of wages were owed to the workers. Because disputes between the contractor and the workers arose frequently, the workers' enthusiasm for production was low, and the project could not be completed on time. Seeing this serious situation, the construction site took back the project and directly led the workers to work, and filed a complaint against Han Zili and others with the Pinding County People's Court. The court had sealed up all the property of Han and Shao in order to repay the workers' wages and the construction site's debts (but Han took the opportunity to abscond when he was released on bail by the Shijiazhuang court, so this matter has not been concluded yet). Han Zili and others adopted feudal and cruel exploitation of the workers in the contracted project. Hao Li'an, the supervisor hired by Han Zili, was a lazy loafer who had a very bad influence among the workers, and he also owed the workers wages. When Han Zili went to Laiyuan to find workers, he first found foremen Shen Hai, Wang Qian, Luan Mu and others. At that time, it was stated that the wages could be calculated by the cubic meter or by the day. If calculated by the cubic meter, the wage was more than 30 jin of rice per cubic meter; if calculated by the day, it was 8 to 12 jin per worker per day. The workers thought it was acceptable, so more than 300 people came. After the start of work, due to the lack of technical guidance, the stone work completed by each worker every day was barely enough to eat. Under this circumstance, most of the workers sold their luggage one after another, and even begged for food to go home. After returning home, the workers filed a complaint with the local people's government and the Shijiazhuang court. This matter has not been resolved until now.

(II) Main Mistakes Existing in the Construction Site

    1.  The viewpoint of relying on workers is not clear, and there is no strict supervision of contractors, so that contractors can take advantage of loopholes. At the beginning of the project, the construction site first relied on contractors and organized workers through feudal overseers, so that the feudal overseer system and feudal exploitation became legal existence. Under such circumstances, the workers were heavily exploited, did not receive the wages they deserved, and did not receive the necessary technical guidance, which caused damage to the project construction. Later, after the leaders of the construction site discovered this serious problem, they re-elected the group leaders and implemented a democratic scoring system for the workers directly led by the construction site; however, for the workers in the entire work area, these tasks were not done well enough. However, when dealing with the dispute between the workers in Laiyuan and Han Zili, the construction site did not solve this problem from the perspective of opposing the exploitation of contractors and feudal overseers.

    2.  Lack of detailed investigation and research on projects and contractors. For example, a large amount of money was advanced to some fraudulent contractors. After the contractor Han Zili owed the construction site more than 100,000 jin of millet, he absconded. As a result, the scheduled tasks could not be completed, causing great losses to the country and the workers.

    3.  In the past, our department's leadership over the construction site was not thorough enough, and we should also bear certain responsibilities. In the future, we will strengthen leadership and inspection of the construction site. And clearly instruct the construction site to earnestly organize and educate workers, carry out the struggle against the exploitation of contractors and feudal overseers at all levels, and rely on the masses of workers to do a good job in the project.

### 华北军区后勤运输部政治部  关于某项工程中所发生纠纷的检查与答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　华北军区后勤运输部政治部
    关于某项工程中所发生纠纷的检查与答复编辑同志：
    六月二十二日人民日报发表了郭茂文同志的信，这封信里指出华北军区后勤部将重要工程包给私商，使工人受到包商包工头非法剥削等等事实。我们见到这封信后，即开始进行调查研究，现将调查研究的结果说明如下。
  （一）包商剥削的事实经过
    一、石家庄私营荣聚建筑工厂承包某地施工所山洞工程后，又转包给工头崔玉山的事情是这样的：崔玉山是一个专事投机剥削，吃、喝、嫖、玩的流氓，曾在石家庄开茶馆，并包用卖唱女人。崔玉山向荣聚建筑工厂承包工程时，工资米每方四十二斤，但发给工人时，每方只有二十五斤。崔并将工资款移作投机买卖，或用于吃、喝、嫖、玩，结果共拖欠下工人孙振海等三十多人的工资米共四千多斤。此事后来交由石家庄人民法院处理，据查所欠工资已还清。
    二、石家庄私营新中建筑工厂承包山洞工程后，也确有转包剥削的事实。新中建筑工厂经理韩自立是平山县的一个被斗地主，副经理邵鸿森是石家庄的商人，他们既没有资本，又没有技术经验。此次承包山洞工程时，按合同曾预借五分之一的工款，该包商不但没有预先拿出资本来用于承包工程，反而将此项预借款的一部分移作补偿他们在藁城承包房屋工程的亏欠。而且该包商因为对山洞工程根本外行，数百工人作不出石方，开支浪费很大，结果亏欠施工所小米十万斤以上；拖欠工人工资也很多。因为包商与工人之间屡起纠纷，工人生产情绪低落，工程不能按时完成。施工所见此严重情况，曾将工程收回，直接领导工人工作，并向平定县人民法院对韩自立等提出控告，法院已将韩、邵全部财产查封，以便偿还工人工资与施工所欠款（但韩由石家庄法院取保出院变款之际竟乘机潜逃，所以此事尚未了结）。韩自立等在承包工程中对工人采取着封建性的残酷剥削，韩自立雇用的监工员郝礼安，是个好吃懒做的二流子，在工人中影响很坏，并拖欠了工人的工资。韩自立到涞源找工人时，先找到工头沈海、王谦、栾木等人，当时说明工资按方按日计算均可，按方计算，每方工价米三十余斤，按日计算，每日每工八至十二斤。工人认为可以，即来了三百多人。开工后，因为缺乏技术指导，每个工人每天所完成的石方工价，仅勉强够吃饭之用。在此情况下，大部工人遂相继变卖行李，甚至讨饭回家。工人回家后，即向当地人民政府及石家庄法院提出控告，直到现在此事尚未解决。
  （二）施工所存在的主要错误
    一、依靠工人的观点不明确，对包商也没有严格的监督，以致使包商有机可乘。工程开始时，施工所首先就是依靠了包商，通过封建把头去组织工人，使封建把头制度和封建剥削竟变为合法的存在。在这种情况下，工人们受到重重剥削，得不到应有的工资，而且得不到必要的技术指导，使工程建筑受到损失。后来施工所领导上发现这一严重的问题后，对施工所直接领导的工人，曾改选了小组长，实行了民主评分制度；但对全工区的工人来说，这些工作做得很不够。但施工所在处理涞源工人与韩自立的纠纷时，也没有从反对包商和封建包工头的剥削上去解决这个问题。
    二、对工程与包商缺乏详细调查研究。如对一些骗人的包商，竟预支给大量款项，包商韩自立欠下施工所小米十万多斤以后，竟潜逃。结果不能完成预定任务，使国家和工人都受到很大损失。
    三、过去本部对施工所的领导不够深入，也应负一定责任。今后我们要对施工所加强领导和检查。并明确指示施工所应认真组织教育工人，开展反对包商和封建把头层层剥削的斗争，依靠工人群众做好工程。
