　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 26th: The famous Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet, who participated in the Berlin World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace as a guest of honor, spoke to a reporter from this agency on the 16th about the impact of the victory of the Chinese revolution on the Turkish people. He said: "The entire Turkish people have been paying attention to the struggle of the Chinese people with extreme admiration and expectation. The workers, peasants, and progressive intellectuals of Turkey regard the struggle of the Chinese people as their own struggle for national liberation and independence, and for happiness and peace. It is precisely for this reason that the Turkish people enthusiastically read the poems and articles by me and other Turkish progressive writers praising the heroic struggle of the Chinese people. Even in prison, we were equally concerned about the situation in China. We risked great danger to listen to radio broadcasts. We often listened to news about China from Radio Moscow. In recent years, because I have been imprisoned for more than ten years, my health has deteriorated, but the news from New China has given me new strength and encouragement."

    When talking about his impression of the Chinese youth delegation participating in the festival, Hikmet said: "Thirty years ago, I met some young Chinese comrades in Moscow. Now, at the Berlin festival, I have met Chinese youth again. I am very excited to see that they are so happy and full of spirit. This is because they are representatives of the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved their national independence, are fighting for their happiness, and are giving righteous assistance to the peace-loving Korean people who are engaged in the struggle for liberation. Youths from all countries and nations welcome Chinese youth with deep admiration, because they know that Chinese youth are a powerful fighting force in the invincible ranks of peace."

　　中国人民革命胜利鼓舞了土耳其人民
    希克梅特畅谈对新中国的热爱
    【新华社柏林二十六日电】以荣誉来宾资格参加柏林和平联欢节的土耳其著名诗人希克梅特，于十六日对本社记者畅谈中国革命胜利对土耳其人民的影响，他说：“土耳其全体人民经常以极度钦佩和期望的心情注意着中国人民的斗争。土耳其的工人、农民和进步知识分子把中国人民的斗争，看成他们自己争取民族解放与独立、争取幸福与和平的斗争。正因为这个缘故，土耳其人民热烈地阅读着我和其他土耳其进步作家歌颂中国人民英雄斗争的诗篇和文章。即使在牢狱里，我们也同样关怀着中国的情况。我们曾冒着极大的危险收听无线电广播。我们经常收听莫斯科电台关于中国的消息。近年来，我因为被监禁了十多年，健康状况愈来愈坏了，但是从新中国传来的消息却给我以新的力量和鼓舞。”
    希克梅特在谈到他对参加联欢节的中国青年代表团的印象时，说：“三十年前我曾在莫斯科认识过一些年青的中国同志。现在，在柏林的联欢节大会上，我再次遇见了中国的青年。我怀着极大的兴奋看到他们是那样快乐，精神那样饱满。这是因为他们是中国人民的代表。中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，已取得了他们的民族独立，正在为他们的幸福而奋斗，并且正给进行解放斗争的爱好和平的朝鲜人民以正义的援助。各国和各民族的青年都怀着深深钦佩的心情欢迎中国青年，因为他们知道：中国青年是不可战胜的和平队伍当中一支强大的战斗力量。”
