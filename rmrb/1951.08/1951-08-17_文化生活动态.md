    People's Literature Publishing House Begins Publishing Books and Periodicals

    The state-owned People's Literature Publishing House was established in Beijing in March of this year. It is jointly led by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government. The president of the publishing house is the writer Feng Xuefeng. The publishing house's editorial policy will focus on modern literature, followed by Chinese folk literature, classical literature, and foreign literature. Regarding modern literature, the focus will be on publishing several series, such as the "Chinese People's Literature and Art Series" and the "Literary Construction Series." In addition, excellent works from local publishing units will be selected for reprinting, with special attention paid to selecting and printing popular literature works. Furthermore, there will be a planned and step-by-step publication of Chinese classical works or foreign masterpieces. In the area of foreign literature, the focus is currently on the works of progressive writers from the Soviet Union, new democratic countries, and capitalist countries. The first priority is the editing and publishing of the "Soviet Literature and Art Series," which will be jointly undertaken by the publishing house and the Times Publishing House. Famous works that have been published in the past by Sanlian or Xinhua Bookstore, such as "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "The Young Guard," will be re-examined and republished.

    Regarding the publication of several collections of writings, the publishing house has also formulated a plan, which includes "The Collection of Qu Qiubai's Writings," a total of four volumes and 1.5 million words, which can be published before the end of the year. The editing and publishing of Lu Xun's works are being led by the publishing house. Some single editions will be printed this year. The work of annotating Lu Xun's works has already begun, but the books will not be published until next year. Another important task of the People's Literature Publishing House is to prepare to establish a special organization for translating Gorky's works this winter or next spring, to systematically review, revise, or re-translate them. The magazines currently published by the publishing house include: "Literary Gazette," "People's Literature," "Liberation Army Literature and Art," "Talk and Sing," and "Folk Literature Collection."

    The publishing house has recently published new books such as "Gratifying Memories" (by Xu Guangping) and "For a Happy Tomorrow" (by Bai Lang), and more than ten other titles.

    The People's Literature Publishing House plans to publish a total of about 100 books this year. In general, the books and periodicals published by the publishing house in the future will be carefully reviewed and meticulously proofread; whether in terms of content or layout, they will be as error-free as possible and become more complete publications. The establishment and work of this publishing institution will greatly promote the development of the national literary publishing industry.

    Qu Junong's Self-Criticism on the "Popular Education Association"

    The Chongqing Dagong Bao published Qu Junong's "Self-Criticism and My Understanding of the 'Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement'" in two days, July 30 and 31, exposing the reactionary essence of the "Popular Education Promotion Association" and Yan Yangchu and the beginning and end of their collusion with American imperialism. The author wrote: "The Popular Education Association initially promoted the work of eliminating illiteracy throughout the country, and later used Ding County, Hebei Province as an experimental area. When the Popular Education Association first arrived in Ding County (Editor's note: The Popular Education Association moved to Ding County from Beijing in 1923), it would not have been possible without the 'permission' of the 'gentry,' that is, the feudal landlord class. If it had not been 'welcomed' by the Zhu family and others in Ding County, it would not have been able to go to Ding County casually. Not long after the Popular Education Association started working in Ding County, Yan Yangchu went to the United States for the first time to raise funds. This was the beginning of his collusion with American imperialism, that is, the beginning of American imperialism's use of the Popular Education Association." According to the author, "The funding of the Popular Education Association... later mainly came from 'donations' in the United States and 'subsidies' from several foundations. For example, Yan Yangchu promoted that the rural health work in Ding County was a 'contribution' of the Popular Education Association, and most of this funding came from the American imperialist 'Milbank Foundation.' Yan Yangchu invited many Americans to visit Ding County to raise funds. When staff members encountered American imperialist 'figures' coming to Ding County, they entertained them and were very busy, making people suspect whether they were working to raise funds or raising funds for work." Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, American organizations that "subsidized" the work of the Popular Education Association also included the "Standard Oil Foundation." The work locations, budget allocations, and personnel arrangements of the institutions affiliated with the Popular Education Association were controlled by Gann, the vice president of this "Standard Oil Foundation," and Grant, the representative of the foundation in China. "The research and investigation materials and practical work materials must of course be reported to them." In 1942, Yan Yangchu went to the United States and actually organized a "Sino-American Committee" of the Popular Education Association in the United States and registered it in New York. The members were Mrs. Roosevelt, Pearl Buck, Stowe, Douglas, Ruth Lamsen, Wallace, Taft, Hochin, etc. (there were also a few Chinese involved). During the same period, Yan Yangchu also requested "subsidies" from the American "United China Relief." After 1945, American imperialism formulated an "education plan" to control China through conspiracy and designated Yan Yangchu as one of the members of the "National Social Education Committee" to implement this plan. In 1948, Yan Yangchu was still active in the United States, trying to get money from "US aid" to run "rural construction." Therefore, he submitted a "memorandum" to Marshall, Truman, Stuart, Douglas, and some reactionary members of the US Congress, "saying that the failure of the Kuomintang reactionary regime was the result of military failure and the cause was the loss of popular support. To win back the lost popular support, communism must be stopped. To form a so-called 'social front' to assist the military, attention must be paid to social construction and rural construction. The content of so-called rural construction is the education, livelihood, health, and autonomy aspects that the Popular Education Association has done. There must be several demonstration centers to train talents. The organization is a 'Sino-American Joint Committee.' This committee is 'independent' and 'non-political.' The funding is requested from 'US aid.'" Prominent American reactionaries such as J. Lossing Buck and Pulitzer were in favor of Yan Yangchu's plan. Later, the US Congress passed a resolution to allocate one-tenth of the 270 million US dollars of "US aid" as "Chinese rural reconstruction funding," which was also supervised by the executors of the US Economic Cooperation Administration. Soon, the pseudo "China Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee" was established, and the Popular Education Association continued to receive "subsidies" from this institution.

    In the early years of the Popular Education Association in Ding County, it not only failed to gain the support of the peasants, but also encountered opposition from some "local forces." However, Yan Yangchu quickly obtained the consent of the Chiang Kai-shek government to designate Ding County as an "experimental county," and compromised with "local forces," and carried out "rural construction" entirely under the protection of landlords. After 1939, Yan Yangchu ran the "Rural Construction College" (Zhang Qun was the chairman of the board) and "experimental areas" in Sichuan, and the Popular Education Association became further a official institution of the reactionary government.

    Qu Junong was an important member of the Popular Education Association. Although his self-criticism excessively emphasized the influence of the objective environment on him, some of the revelations he made about the "Popular Education Association" can make the world more clearly understand the truth about a group of "reformists" led by Yan Yangchu relying on imperialism and feudal forces.

    瞿菊农自我检讨中的“平教会”
    重庆大公报七月三十日和三十一日两天发表了瞿菊农的《自我检讨及我对于“中华平民教育促进会”的认识》一文，揭露了“平民教育促进会”和晏阳初的反动本质及勾结美帝国主义的始末。作者写道：“平教会起初在全国各地推行扫除文盲的工作，后来才以河北省定县为实验区。平教会之初到定县（编者按：平教会系于一九二三年从北京迁定县），若得不到‘士绅’，亦即封建势力地主阶级的‘许可’，是不可能的。若不是得到定县朱家等的‘欢迎’，是不能随便到定县去的。平教会到定县工作不久，晏阳初即初次到美国募捐款子，这是他开始勾结美帝国主义，亦即是美帝国主义利用平教会的开始。”据作者说，“平教会的经费…………，后来主要的来源靠在美国的‘捐款’与若干基金会的‘补助’。例如晏阳初宣传说定县乡村卫生工作是平教会的一个‘贡献’，这笔经费即大部出自美帝国主义‘米而板基金会’。晏阳初为募捐，找了许多美国人到定县参观。工作人员遇到美帝国主义的‘人物’来定县就应酬招待，忙个不了，使人怀疑是为募捐而工作，还是为工作而募捐。”在抗战以前，给平教会的工作以“补助”的美国团体还有“煤油大王基金会。”平教会所属机构的工作地点、预算分配及人事安排都由这个“煤油大王基金会”的副会长甘恩及该会驻华代表格兰脱操纵，“研究调查与实际工作的材料当然要报告他们”。一九四二年，晏阳初到美国去，居然在美国组织了一个平教会的“中美委员会”，并且在纽约办了登记手续。委员是罗斯福夫人，赛珍珠、斯委勃，道格拉斯，鲁思兰须勤，华莱士，塔夫脱，霍勤等（也有几个中国人参与）。在同一期间，晏阳初也向美国“援华救济联合会”要到“补助”。一九四五年以后，美帝国主义制订了一个阴谋控制中国的“教育计划”，并且指定晏阳初为执行此计划的“全国社会教育委员会”的委员之一。一九四八年晏阳初还在美国活动，想从“美援”中争一笔钱办“乡村建设”，他因此向马歇尔、杜鲁门、司徒雷登、道格拉斯以及美国国会一部分反动议员提出了一个“备忘录”，“说国民党反动政权之失败，军事失败是果，失去民心是因。要争回已失的人心，才能制止共产主义。要形成所谓‘社会阵线’来辅助军事，要注重社会建设，农村建设。所谓农村建设的内容，即是平教会所做的教育、生计、卫生、自治各方面。要有若干示范的中心，要训练人才。组织上是一个‘中美联合委员会’。这个委员会是‘独立’的、‘非政治’的。经费则请求‘美援’。”美国著名反动分子周以德和蒲立德等都赞成晏阳初的计划。后来美国国会通过从二亿七千万元的“美援”中拨出十分之一作为“中国农村复兴拨款”，亦归美国经济合作总署的执行人监管。不久便成立了伪“中国农村复兴联合委员会”，平教会即从这个机构继续请得“补助”。
    平教会在定县的最初几年，本来不仅得不到农民的拥护，也受到一部分“地方势力”的反对。但是晏阳初很快得到蒋介石政府的同意，把定县划为“实验县”，并与“地方势力”妥协，完全在地主卵翼下进行“农村建设”。一九三九年以后，晏阳初在四川办“乡村建设学院”（张群任董事长）及“实验区”，平教会就更进一步成为反动政府的官方机构了。
    瞿菊农是平教会的重要分子。他的检讨虽然过多地强调了客观环境对他的影响，但是这个检讨对“平教会”所作的一些揭露，可以使世人更清楚地认识以晏阳初为首的一派“改良主义者”依附帝国主义和封建势力的真相。
