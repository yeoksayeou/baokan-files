		Party Propaganda Network in the Northwest Region

　　Over the past six months, the Northwest region has established 1,809 report speakers and 12,491 propagandists (excluding Xinjiang Province). Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Xi'an have established them more universally. Ningxia adopted the approach of selecting a typical district in each county and a typical township in each district for pilot implementation, and then promoting it throughout the province. Currently, about two-thirds of the townships in 14 counties and 2 cities in the province have established propaganda networks, with a total of 1,823 propagandists and 144 report speakers at the provincial and county levels. More than 50 propagandists have also been established in provincial-level agencies and some factories. More than half of the counties and cities have held training classes for propagandists.

　　Facts from areas where propaganda networks have been established prove that report speakers and propagandists have played a significant role in publicizing the Party's policies and raising the political awareness of the masses. In Xi'an, 88 report speakers at the city and district levels delivered 349 reports to cadres and the masses on Party history, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, welcoming the "May 1st" patriotic demonstration, the workers' labor insurance regulations, and mobilizing students to join military cadre schools, with a total audience of 220,000. In Gansu's Wuwei sub-region and Wuwei county, report speakers have also delivered 224 reports to the masses in five months, with an audience of 100,000.

　　Many tasks have proceeded more smoothly after being publicized by report speakers and propagandists. In Xi'an, propagandists conducted patriotic production education in factories, and the workers' production enthusiasm soared. As a result, 37 factories completed their production tasks ahead of schedule and exceeded their targets. In Tongguan County, Shaanxi, thanks to the propagandists' in-depth publicity of the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries, the masses in the second district and fourth township exposed the habitual bandit Zhang Zhirang and his three brothers. Wan Shanfu, a bandit leader from Tongguan, was also captured by the masses from Jingyang. In Qinghai Province, in the work of mobilizing the masses to regulate grain supplies, the work progressed smoothly in areas where the propagandists carried out in-depth publicity. The awareness of the masses has also improved accordingly.

　　Party committees in areas where propaganda networks have been established have conducted preliminary education and training for report speakers and propagandists, gradually making them an important bridge connecting the Party and the people. Xi'an's leadership of report speakers is more specific, not only formulating key points for reports but also urging the hosting units to liaise with the report speakers. After the reports, the hosting units organize discussions. They also issue work inspection cards for report speakers to understand their work situation and the various ideological trends of the masses. In order to provide regular guidance for the work of propagandists and provide publicity materials, Chang'an, Hua County, Tongguan, Nanzheng and other places in Shaanxi have held propagandist conferences, propagandist representative conferences, and short-term training classes for propagandists to explain policies and current affairs, impart publicity methods, specifically inspect work, make plans, assign tasks, and exchange experiences. The Propaganda Department of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Xinjiang Branch published the "Propagandist Handbook." The Xi'an Municipal Party Committee founded the "Propagandist Newspaper," and provincial newspapers opened propagandist columns to guide the activities of propagandists and provide them with various publicity materials.

　　In areas where propagandists have been widely established, propaganda work has begun to become routine. In Yinchuan City, Ningxia, 140 propagandists have led and participated in reading groups. Major propaganda tools such as blackboards, reading groups, loudspeakers, Yangko teams, and amateur theater troupes in some counties and cities, such as Zhongwei and Zhongning, have been largely mastered and led by propagandists. In some areas with more propagandists, propaganda work targets have been fixed to deliver news and publicize policies to the masses at any time. Propagandists in Xi'an have also begun to conduct regular and systematic publicity among the masses in the city through more than 400 reading groups, 362 amateur schools, and 519 blackboards. Now, many propagandists feel that the work is specific and there is something to do.

　　The establishment of propaganda networks has begun to be combined with the establishment of various mass propaganda organizations. During the reorganization of the propaganda network in January of this year, various places, according to the decision of the Party Central Committee, compiled unqualified propagandists into propaganda groups or current affairs study groups and established and expanded mass propaganda organizations through diverse forms of propaganda and propaganda tools. A total of 20,500 reading groups have been established in Shaanxi Province, with more than 320,000 people participating in the reading groups. Tongguan County, Shaanxi Province, has done a better job in this regard. In the county with 36 townships and a population of 60,000, in addition to establishing 135 propagandists, more than 400 mass activists were also absorbed to participate in propaganda work. According to the total population of the county, an average of one propagandist per 100 people is regularly engaged in propaganda work. Under the personal participation or leadership of these propagandists, 306 reading groups have been organized, 231 blackboards have been published; 20 folk music classes are being reformed, and most of them can now sing new songs and perform new operas; 106 Yangko teams have been developed; small libraries and sales stations for popular books and periodicals have been established. In particular, loudspeakers have been set up and earthen movies (slides) have been created to promptly publicize current events, policies, and central work to the masses. Earthen movies are shown almost every night in Tongguan City, and propaganda reports from loudspeakers can be heard every day, which is very popular among the masses.

　　However, the establishment of propaganda networks in the Northwest region is still not universal, and the vast rural areas have not yet been widely established. According to the population of 26 million in the Northwest, there is only one propagandist per 2,000 people on average. Taking Shaanxi Province, which has more than 7,000 propagandists, as an example, most of them are in agencies, factories, and schools above the district level, and some are just a formality. There are more Party members and League members in the old revolutionary base areas of northern Shaanxi, but there are very few propagandists.

### 西北区党的宣传网

　　西北区党的宣传网
    西北全区半年来已建立报告员一千八百零九名，宣传员一万二千四百九十一名（缺新疆省），其中以陕西、宁夏和西安市建立得比较普遍。宁夏是采取每县选择一个区，每区选择一个乡典型试办，然后向全省推广。现全省十四个县、两个市约有三分之二的乡已建立宣传网，共有宣传员一千八百二十三名，省、县级报告员一百四十四名，省级机关和部分工厂也已建立宣传员五十多名。并有半数以上的县、市开办过宣传员训练班。
    从已建立宣传网地区的事实证明，报告员、宣传员在宣传党的政策，提高群众政治觉悟等方面起了很大的作用。西安市市、区两级八十八个报告员，三个月中，就党史、镇压反革命、迎接“五一”爱国大示威、工人劳动保险条例、动员学生参加军干校等问题，共向干部和群众做了三百四十九次报告，听众有二十二万。甘肃武威分区级和武威县级报告员，五个月来，也向群众作了二百二十四次报告，听众达十万人。
    许多工作经过报告员、宣传员宣传后，进行时都比较顺利。西安市宣传员对工厂进行了爱国主义生产教育，各厂工人生产情绪高涨，结果就有三十七个工厂提前超额完成了生产任务。陕西潼关县，由于宣传员深入地宣传了惩治反革命条例，二区四乡群众便检举出惯匪张志让三兄弟。潼关土匪头子万善福，也被群众从泾阳捕捉回来。青海省在发动群众调剂口粮等工作中，凡是经过宣传员深入宣传的地方，工作就顺利展开。群众觉悟也就随着提高。
    已建立宣传网的地区的党委，都对报告员、宣传员进行了初步教育和培养工作，使他们逐渐成为联系党和人民群众的重要桥梁。西安市对报告员的领导较为具体，不仅制订报告要点，并且督促主持单位同报告员联络，报告后，又让主持单位组织讨论；并制发报告员工作检查卡片，了解报告员工作情况和群众的各种思想动态。为了对宣传员工作进行经常指导并供给宣传资料，陕西长安、华县、潼关、南郑等地曾分别召开过宣传员大会、宣传员代表会、宣传员短期训练班，讲解政策时事，传授宣传方法，具体检查工作，订计划，分配任务，交流经验。中共中央西北局宣传部和新疆分局出版了“宣传员手册”，西安市委创办《宣传员报》，各省级报纸均辟宣传员专栏，个别县并印发宣传资料，以指导宣传员活动与供给他们各种宣传资料。
    目前已普遍建立宣传员的地区，宣传工作已开始走向经常化。宁夏银川市一百零四十名宣传员都领导和参加了读报组。中卫、中宁等部分县、市的主要宣传工具如黑板报、读报组、广播筒、秧歌队、业余剧团等，已大部分为宣传员所掌握和领导。个别县宣传员较多的地区都已固定了宣传工作对象，随时向群众传递消息，宣传政策。西安市宣传员也通过四百多个读报组、三百六十二所业余学校和五百一十九块黑板报，开始经常有系统地在本市群众中进行宣传，现在，许多宣传员都感到工作具体，有事可做。
    建立宣传网同建立各种群众宣传组织的工作开始结合起来。今年一月开始整顿宣传网过程中，各地曾根据党中央的决定，把不够条件的宣传员编为宣传小组或时事学习小组，并通过多样宣传形式和宣传工具，建立和扩大了群众性的宣传组织。陕西全省现已建立读报组两万零五百个，有三十二万多人参加了读报组。在这方面作得较好的是陕西省潼关县。全县三十六个乡，六万人口，除建立了一百三十五名宣传员外，而且把四百多个群众积极分子也吸收参加了宣传工作。按照全县总人口来比较，平均每一百个人中就有一个宣传员经常在进行宣传工作。在这些宣传员亲自参加或领导之下，全县已组织了三百零六个读报组，出版二百三十一块黑板报；二十个民间音乐班正在进行改造，现大部分已能唱新曲子，演新戏；又发展了一百零六个秧歌队；举办了小型图书馆和推行通俗书刊的代销站。特别是设立了广播筒，创造了土电影（幻灯），把时事、政策和中心工作及时向群众进行宣传。潼关城内几乎夜夜演土电影，天天可以听到广播筒的宣传报告，群众很欢迎。
    但是西北区建立宣传网的工作还是很不普遍的，广大的农村仍然未广泛建立起来。按照西北两千六百万人口计算。现平均两千人中仅有一个宣传员。就拿有七千多宣传员的陕西省来说，多半在区以上机关、工厂、学校中，有些还只是一个形式。陕北老区党员和团员较多，可是宣传员却很少。
