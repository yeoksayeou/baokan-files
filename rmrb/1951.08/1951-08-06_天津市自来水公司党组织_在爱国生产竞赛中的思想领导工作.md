　　The grassroots organization of the Communist Party in the Tianjin Waterworks Company paid attention to ideological leadership in the patriotic production campaign, ensuring the smooth development of the patriotic production campaign and creating many new records.
　　At the beginning of the patriotic production campaign in the Tianjin Waterworks Company, although the workers had high enthusiasm for production, there were still some misconceptions about the patriotic production campaign. For example, several old technicians in the repair shop said, "Just focus on working hard, why compete to be a model?" Many workers also held the idea of "more rewards, more production." In short, many workers lacked a correct understanding of patriotism and collectivism. The Waterworks Company Party Organization analyzed and studied these erroneous ideas, recognizing that these ideas would trivialize the patriotic production campaign. It decided to strengthen ideological education for all employees to eliminate these erroneous ideas and establish correct concepts of the patriotic production campaign.
　　First, ideological education was conducted among all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and propagandists; then, they were used to carry out extensive publicity and mobilization work among all employees. Patriotic education and socialist education were carried out for Party members. The Communist Youth League held a forum for League members and carried out collective heroism education, reading Korean dispatches such as "Who are the most beloved people?" and "Young people, make your youth more beautiful!" and discussed what proletarian heroism is. This forum was very educational for the League members, and some people said with emotion afterwards, "If we don't work hard in production and study, we will really let down the volunteers who are defending the motherland." At the same time, a special meeting of propagandists was also held (the company has sixty propagandists), focusing on analyzing and criticizing the vulgar propaganda of "more rewards, more production," and proposed that "every newsletter, every cartoon, and every broadcast should have appropriate political content." The propagandists were called upon to strengthen their political study and at least read newspapers and "propaganda manuals." In this way, Party members, League members, and propagandists began to carry out extensive publicity and mobilization work among employees.
　　Secondly, political quizzes were conducted among employees to promote political study. Quiz questions were issued in response to the employees' ideological situation. Before the quiz, everyone was asked to prepare. Finally, based on the quiz results, answers were provided to the employees; and the employees were organized to discuss, so that the employees clearly recognized the political significance of the patriotic production campaign from this quiz and clarified their goals. Workers at the river water plant said, "After this quiz, I understood the meaning of the patriotic production campaign."
　　Thirdly, political mobilization was carried out frequently. At the beginning of the patriotic production campaign, it was proposed that carrying out the patriotic production campaign was to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, defeat American imperialism, and build our great motherland. Therefore, the labor enthusiasm of the workers was inspired. In early June, a reporting group was organized to report the production achievements of Red May to Tianjin Mayor Huang Jing and Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Huang Huoqing. After the reporting group returned to the factory, they conveyed Mayor Huang Jing's instructions to everyone, which further encouraged everyone's patriotic production campaign enthusiasm. After the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea issued the three major calls, an increase production and donation campaign was launched, and the patriotic competition covenant was revised. On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, employees were mobilized to use their increased production as a gift to the Chinese Communist Party. This further improved the political consciousness of the workers, and they proposed rationalization proposals for improving technology, improving operation methods, and improving labor organization.
　　At the same time, the past tendency of lacking political content in propaganda work was overcome. In order to strengthen current affairs education for employees, worker reading groups were generally established throughout the company. Some workers felt that "not reading the newspaper is like missing something." In addition, small newspapers and bulletins were published, and the broadcasting station also paid attention to broadcasting propaganda with political content; propaganda methods with political and ideological content were created.
　　Because the company's Party organization paid attention to ideological leadership in the patriotic production campaign, improved the political consciousness of employees, and guaranteed the victory of the patriotic production campaign, in June alone, all employees created sixteen new records and reduced costs by five percent.

　　天津市自来水公司党组织
    在爱国生产竞赛中的思想领导工作
    中共天津市企业党委会
    天津市自来水公司共产党的基层组织，在爱国生产竞赛运动中注意思想领导，保证了爱国生产竞赛运动顺利展开，并创造许多新纪录。
    天津市自来水公司爱国生产竞赛运动开始时，虽然职工的生产热情很高，但是对爱国生产竞赛还是存在着一些错误的认识。例如修理场的几个老技术工人说：“埋头干活就算了，何必竞赛当模范。”又有很多职工抱着“多得奖，多生产”的思想。总之，有很多职工对爱国主义及集体主义还缺乏正确的认识。自来水公司党组织对于这些错误思想进行了分析研究，认识了这些思想会使爱国生产竞赛流于庸俗化，决定对全体职工加强思想教育，以消除这些错误思想，使大家树立起正确的爱国生产竞赛观念。
    首先在全体共产党员、青年团员及宣传员中进行思想教育；再通过他们向全体职工进行广泛的宣传鼓动工作。对党员进行了爱国主义教育、社会主义教育。对青年团举办了团员座谈会，进行了集体英雄主义教育，朗读“谁是最可爱的人”、“年轻人，让你的青春更美丽吧！”等朝鲜通讯，并座谈什么是无产阶级的英雄主义。这个座谈会对团员们有很大的教育意义，事后有些人很感动地说：“我们再不好好生产、学习，实在对不起保卫祖国的志愿军。”同时又专门召开了宣传员会议（该公司有宣传员六十名），着重分析批判了“多得奖金、多生产”的庸俗宣传，并提出要作到“每一篇通讯、每一幅漫画、每一次广播都要有适当的政治内容”。号召宣传员要加强自己的政治学习，至少要读报纸及“宣传手册”。这样，党员、团员及宣传员就开始向职工展开了广泛的宣传鼓动工作。
    其次，在职工中进行政治测验，以推动职工的政治学习。针对职工的思想情况出了测验题。测验之前，先叫大家准备。最后又根据测验结果，向职工作了解答；并组织职工讨论，使职工从这次测验中，明确认识了爱国生产竞赛的政治意义，弄清了自己的奋斗目标。河水厂的工人说：“经过这次测验，我把爱国生产竞赛的意思搞清楚了。”
    再次，就是经常地进行政治鼓动。爱国生产竞赛一开始，就提出了开展爱国生产竞赛运动是为了支援中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军，打败美帝国主义，建设我们伟大的祖国。因此启发了职工的劳动热情。六月初又组织了报喜团，向天津市黄敬市长、天津市总工会黄火青主席报告红五月生产成绩。报喜团回厂后，又把黄敬市长的指示传达给大家，更鼓舞了大家的爱国生产竞赛热情。在抗美援朝总会发出三大号召后，又展开增产捐献运动，修订爱国竞赛公约。在中国共产党成立三十周年时，又发动职工以自己的增产作为给中国共产党的献礼。这样更提高了工人的政治觉悟，他们纷纷提出改进技术、改进操作方法及改进劳动组织的合理化建议。
    同时克服了过去宣传工作中缺乏政治内容的偏向。为了加强对职工的时事教育，全公司普遍建立了工人读报小组。有些工人感到“不读报就像缺了什么似的”。此外又出版了小报、快报，广播台也注意了播送富有政治内容的宣传；创造了有政治性思想性的宣传方式。
    由于该公司党组织注意了爱国生产竞赛运动中的思想领导，提高了职工的政治觉悟，保证了爱国生产竞赛运动的胜利，只六月份，全体职工即创造了十六项新纪录，成本降低百分之五。
