Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: According to a TASS dispatch from Warsaw: Polish newspapers all prominently published the correspondence between Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and U.S. President Truman on the 9th. Both *People's Tribune* and *Warsaw Life* published editorials commenting on it.

　　The *People's Tribune* editorial stated that the resounding call for peace once again emanated from Moscow. The resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and Shvernik's reply to Truman outlined specific and effective ways to improve U.S.-Soviet relations and pointed out the path to strengthen and consolidate international peace. This path is to conclude a peace pact among the five major powers. The Soviet resolution on concluding a peace pact among the five major powers once again proved the Soviet government's consistent policy of international peace and friendship, which not only conforms to the interests and aspirations of the Soviet people engaged in great communist construction, but also conforms to the interests and aspirations of people worldwide, including the American people. The U.S. government knows the true sentiments of the people of various countries and the majority of the American people, therefore, it constantly lies, describing its policy as a policy of peace. But what matters in politics is not words, but actions. And actions unambiguously prove that the U.S. government not only undermined the policy of peace in the past, but is now intensifying preparations for war every day and advancing along the path of aggression and armed adventurism. These facts have completely refuted the verbal declarations in Truman's letter, and it is impossible to cover them up. The Polish people wholeheartedly support the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, believing that this is another major contribution of the Soviet Union to the cause of consolidating peace.

　　The *Warsaw Life* editorial said: The simple, clear, and sincere reply of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR reveals the real reasons for the current international tense situation and summarizes the ways to strengthen peace. The Korean War, which has cost the lives of many young Americans, has made the American people aware of the consequences of the policy of aggression. The wall of lies and anti-Soviet slander that tries to hide the truth from the American people has begun to crumble. The resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet seriously undermines the foundation of this lie.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: According to TASS: Newspapers in Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania have all published the exchange of letters between Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and U.S. President Truman, and published commentaries.

　　Czechoslovakia's *Red Right* published an editorial entitled "Irrefutable Proof," saying: By comparing these two letters, one can reach the answer of who advocates peace and who advocates war. The American document is just empty talk, while the Soviet document is facts and specific suggestions. The Soviet document is a huge help to the struggle of the people of all countries for peace. These documents also expose the essence of American policy, which intends to use general empty words to cover up the policy of preparing to launch a major war, and its actual purpose is to turn the people into tools of the policy of aggression. The editorial concludes by saying: The Czechoslovak people have learned to identify friends and enemies not based on words but based on actions. The Czech people have learned from experience the essence of American policy, and they will unite more closely under Stalin's banner of peace.

　　Romania's *Spark* said: The resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR tore off the masks of Truman and other warmongers, and explained that behind the "peace initiative" lies the imperialist policy of war preparations. *Free Romania* said: Truman, the defender of the interests of the American magnates, only needs to talk about peace, and he confuses the American government's policy of aggression with the American people's desire for peace, which is provocative.

　　Hungary's *Free People's Daily* said: It is the greatest shamelessness for Truman to mention the American people when explaining the origin of his policy or the policy of Congress. They say that the Soviet Union hinders the approach of the Soviet people and the American people, which is a blatant lie. The American letter was written by those who openly clamor for war on other occasions. The people of the world have every reason to believe that this letter shows that the aggressive forces want to deceive the people of all countries.

　　Bulgaria's *Fatherland Front* said: Shvernik's specific proposals on practically establishing international friendly relations to strengthen peace are a new weapon for peace defenders.

　　Albania's *People's Voice* published an editorial, pointing out that today the whole world sees that it is not Soviet troops but American, British, and French troops that are waging wars in Korea and Vietnam. Progressive humanity, concerned about peace, demands that the words in Truman's letter and the resolution of the U.S. Congress be consistent with actions, and should not be empty declarations intended to deceive the people of all countries.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: Shvernik's reply to Truman, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet have aroused enthusiastic responses among progressive public opinion and progressive people in Western European capitalist countries.

　　According to TASS: The Italian newspaper *Unità* published the full text of the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR under the title "The Great Action of the Soviet Union in the Movement to Defend World Peace." *Avanti!* and *Paese Sera* also published the Soviet resolution with large headlines, emphasizing the international significance of this resolution, and stating that the proposal to conclude a peace pact among the five major powers will be supported by people all over the world.

　　*Unità* reported that the Italian working people warmly welcomed the proposal to conclude a peace pact among the five major powers put forward in the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Grand rallies were held in many industrial enterprises in Livorno, Dalmine, and other cities, and resolutions were passed at the meetings to support the Soviet proposal. The Italian working people unanimously demanded that the parliament and the government take steps to implement this resolution.

　　The French newspaper *L'Humanité* emphasized that the proposal of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR is concrete evidence of the Soviet policy of peace, and it is also concrete evidence of the Soviet government's efforts to strengthen peace and cooperation among countries. *Ce Soir* published the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR under the huge title "The Soviet Union Proposes to Sign a Peace Pact Among the Five Major Powers to Strengthen Peace."

　　The British *Daily Worker* published the full text of the two Soviet documents and published an editorial saying that the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR "is the most meaningful step in the Soviet Union's struggle for world peace." The newspaper criticized the British Foreign Office and the U.S. State Department for hastily rejecting the Soviet proposal to conclude a peace pact among the five major powers, saying: "The people of Western capitalist countries are somewhat tired of those officials and politicians whose only diplomatic means is to declare that any peaceful expression of the Soviet Union is a trick. The fact is that the Western countries do not want to hold any meetings at this stage. There is a danger of a devastating atomic world war in this policy. One thing is very clear: the Soviet Union is willing to hold peace talks immediately."

　　Unlike the official representatives and ruling groups of the United Kingdom, Maurice, General Secretary of the non-warfare organization "Peace Pledge Union," and Bailey, a member of the Quaker delegation that recently visited the Soviet Union, welcomed Shvernik's letter to Truman. Maurice demanded that Britain and the United States quickly issue approving replies.

　　各国人民拥护什维尔尼克的建议
    赞成缔结和平公约巩固国际和平
    谴责杜鲁门政府扩军备战违背全世界人民愿望
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社华沙讯：波兰各报均于九日以显著地位刊登了苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克和美国总统杜鲁门往来的信件。《人民论坛报》和《华沙生活报》均发表社论加以评述。
    《人民论坛报》的社论说，响彻云霄的和平呼声再度从莫斯科发出来了。苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议案和什维尔尼克给杜鲁门的复信，概述了改善美苏关系的具体有效的道路，并指出加强和巩固国际和平的道路。这条道路就是缔结五大国和平公约。苏联关于缔结五大国和平公约的决议案，再度证明了苏联政府一贯推行国际和平友好的政策，这个政策不仅符合从事伟大共产主义建设的苏联人民的利益和愿望，而且也符合全世界人民包括美国人民在内的利益和愿望。美国政府知道各国人民和美国大多数人民的真实情绪，因此，不断撒谎，把它所推行的政策说成和平政策。但是在政治中起作用的不是言论，而是行动。而行动毫不含混地证明：美国政府不仅在过去破坏和平政策，而且现在每天都在加紧准备战争，并且沿着侵略与武装冒险的道路前进。这些事实已把杜鲁门信中的口头宣言驳斥得体无完肤，想要掩盖这些事实是不可能的。波兰人民衷心拥护苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议案，认为这是苏联对巩固和平事业的又一重大贡献。”
    《华沙生活报》的社论说：苏联最高苏维埃主席团的简单、明了而诚挚的答复，揭示了现在国际紧张形势的真正原因，并且概括地叙述了加强和平的途径。使美国许多青年丧失性命的朝鲜战争，已经使得美国人民了解到侵略政策的下场了。想在美国人民面前掩盖真实情况的谎话，和反苏谰言的墙壁，已摇摇欲倒。苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议严重地摧毁了这种谎话的基础。
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社讯：捷、罗、匈、保、阿尔巴尼亚各国报纸，都发表了苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克和美国总统杜鲁门互换的信件，并发表评论。
    捷克斯洛伐克的《红色权利报》发表题为《无可辩驳的证明》的社论说：将这两封信加以比较，就可以得出答案，是谁主张和平，谁主张战争。美国的文件只是一些空话，而苏联的文件则是事实和具体的建议。苏联的文件对于各国人民争取和平的斗争是一个巨大的帮助。这些文件也暴露了美国政策的要旨，它打算用一般的空言来遮掩准备发动大战的政策，其实际目的便是要把人民变为侵略政策的工具。社论最后说：捷克斯洛伐克人民已经学会了不是根据言论而是根据行动来识别朋友和仇敌，捷克人民已经从经验中认识到美国政策的本质，他们将愈加紧密地团结在斯大林的和平旗帜之下。
    罗马尼亚的《火花报》说：苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议撕破了杜鲁门和其他战争贩子的假面具，说明在“和平倡议”背后藏着帝国主义的备战政策。《自由罗马尼亚报》说：美国豪门利益的卫士杜鲁门所需要的只是空谈和平，他把美国政府的侵略政策和美国人民争取和平的愿望混为一谈，是具有挑拨意义的。
    匈牙利的《自由人民报》说：杜鲁门在说明他的政策或国会政策的由来时提到美国人民，是最大的无耻。他们说苏联阻碍苏联人民和美国人民的接近，是睁着眼撒谎。美国的信件是那些在别的场合公然叫嚣战争的人们写的，世界人民有一切理由相信这封信表明侵略势力想欺骗各国人民。
    保加利亚的《祖国阵线报》说：什维尔尼克的关于实际建立国际友好关系以加强和平的具体建议，是给予和平保卫者的新武器。
    阿尔巴尼亚的《人民之声报》发表社论，指出今天全世界都看到在朝鲜、越南进行战争的，不是苏联军队而是美英法的军队。关心和平的进步人类都要求杜鲁门的信和美国国会的决议中所说的话，要与行动相符合，而不应是意图欺骗各国人民的空洞宣言。
    【新华社十一日讯】苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克给杜鲁门的复信及最高苏维埃主席团的决议，在西欧资本主义国家进步舆论与进步人民中引起热烈的反应。
    据塔斯社消息：意大利《团结报》以《苏联在保卫世界和平运动中的伟大行动》为题登载了苏联最高苏维埃主席团决议的全文。《前进报》及《国家报》，也以大标题刊载了苏联的决议，强调这项决议在国际上的重要意义，并称，缔结五大国和平公约的建议，将受到全世界人民的支持。
    《团结报》报道了意大利劳动人民热烈欢迎苏联最高苏维埃主席团决议里提出的缔结五大国和平公约建议的情形。在里窝那、大兰多及其他城市的许多工业企业里，都举行了盛大的集会，会上通过决议，支持苏联的这项建议。意大利的劳动人民一致要求议会及政府采取步骤，以实现这项决议。
    法国《人道报》强调指出，苏联最高苏维埃主席团的建议，是苏联和平政策的具体证据，也是苏联政府为加强和平及各国间的合作的努力的具体证据。《今晚报》用《苏联建议签订五大国和平公约，以加强和平》的巨大的标题，发表了苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议案。
    英国《工人日报》刊载了苏联两个文件的全文，并发表社论说，苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议，“是苏联在争取世界和平的斗争中最有意义的一步”。该报抨击英国外交部与美国国务院慌忙拒绝苏联提出的缔结五大国和平公约建议的态度说：“西方资本主义国家的人民，对于那些唯一的外交手段便是宣布苏联的任何一个和平的表示都是诡计的官员与政客，已有些厌烦了。事实是，西方国家不希望在目前阶段举行任何会议。这个政策中存在着毁灭性的原子世界大战的危险。有一件事是非常清楚的：苏联愿意立即举行和平谈判。”
    和英国官方的及统治集团的代表不同，非战主义团体“和平保障同盟”总书记莫里斯和最近访苏的教友派代表团团员贝利都欢迎什维尔尼克致杜鲁门的信。莫里斯要求英国和美国迅速发出赞成的答复。
