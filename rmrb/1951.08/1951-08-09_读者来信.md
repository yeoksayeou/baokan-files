　　　　　Harbin Factories
　　　　　Constantly Experience Reworking and Waste in Capital Construction
Editor:
　　Since June, the People's Daily has continuously reported on the losses caused by starting construction without proper design, and has published a special editorial. I believe this is sounding an alarm to those who are irresponsible in capital construction and do not care about the wealth of the motherland. Now, based on what I know, I would like to offer a few opinions.
　　First, I believe the issue of "construction is impossible without a correct design" is very important and also a serious problem in some units. For example, when the Harbin Sugar Factory was building a workers' club, they started digging the foundation before the design was finalized. After two days of digging, they said the direction had changed, so they had to change it. After construction began, the on-site supervisor and workers did not know how many floors there would be. After the building was completed, when the film projector was installed, the light shone on the ceiling, so they had to tear it down and rebuild it. The factory forgot to design the toilet and smoking room because they were designing and building at the same time. All this shows that construction is impossible without a correct engineering design.
　　Second, I believe that the leadership's irresponsibility, lack of in-depth investigation at the grassroots level, and bureaucratic style of not conducting inspections will not only lead to the absence of correct engineering design, but also cause problems even if there is an engineering design. For example, when the Harbin Sugar Factory was building family dormitories, the on-site person in charge thought it was the main building, so all the sand needed for the project was placed where the main building was supposed to be. But then it was decided to change it to the side building, but no one was informed, so it cost more than 200 workdays to move the sand again. Can this be attributed to a lack of business management or late budget approval?
　　Based on the above situation, I believe that if leading cadres go deep into the grassroots and pay attention to engineering design, errors in capital construction can be avoided or reduced. I have discussed this understanding with the workers, and they also believe that the opinions put forward by Comrade Chen Yougong are simply emphasizing objective reasons and making excuses for mistakes.
　　Regarding manufacturers not fulfilling contracts and failing to deliver goods by the dates stipulated in the contracts, I believe we should first examine whether we have fulfilled our responsibilities when signing the contracts, whether we understand the manufacturer's production capacity, and whether the contract stipulates quality standards and penalty rules for non-compliance with the contract. For example, in the case of the Harbin Waterworks manufacturing a 350 kVA (capacity unit of electrical equipment) transformer, the comrade in charge of signing the contract did not consider the factory's production capacity and technical conditions, only thinking that they were old friends they used to know and that it was a factory set up by someone who had left the factory. Therefore, the contract only guaranteed a lifespan of three years (generally it should be more than ten years). They also did not check the progress of the project on a regular basis. Fifty billion yuan had been spent, but only 2.9 billion yuan of materials had been purchased, and the project had not yet started. Another example is the contract signed by the Public Utilities Company's Automobile Factory and the repair shop under the company's leadership. They only thought that they were all under the leadership of the same company, so who could cheat whom? Therefore, the contract only stipulated the quantity and the delivery date for the first quarter, but did not stipulate quality standards. As a result, there were many defective products, causing work stoppages and material shortages. The Industrial Company's Woolen Mill improved the workers' hygiene equipment and manufactured cotton washing machines, but because it was given to a factory they knew, they only talked about it verbally. As a result, the semi-finished product exceeded the price, so they had to stop doing it, which not only tied up funds but also affected the completion of the workers' hygiene equipment on schedule. Can such situations be said to be caused by manufacturers not fulfilling contracts and preventing construction from proceeding? The external influence has a certain role in the development of everything, but the internal factor that determines the change of things is the internal factor, and capital construction is no exception. In short, I believe that we, as financial and economic workers, should treat mistakes with an honest attitude.

　　　　It is necessary to correct the bad habit of not keeping meeting times
　　(1)
　　At present, there is a serious phenomenon in various places of not keeping meeting times and not being fully prepared before meetings. For example, on June 3rd, the representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea held a report meeting in the auditorium of the Ministry of Trade. The ticket stated that it would start at 1 p.m., but it was actually delayed until 2 p.m. On July 1st, a conference convened by the China Native Produce Company clearly stated on the ticket that it would start "punctually" at 7:30 a.m., but at 7:30 a.m. there was no one in the venue. At 7:55 a.m., the convening unit came to tidy up the venue, and the meeting did not officially begin until after 9 a.m.
　　There are countless examples of this kind of thing. It is really a serious bad habit that should be taken seriously by the leading organs. The several examples cited above have caused a great waste of time. Taking the conference convened by the China Native Produce Company as an example, it was delayed by one and a half hours. If we calculate that there were 1,000 attendees, then 1,500 hours were wasted. In the third example cited, "3,000 people wasted 3,000 hours." This is such a serious loss! Therefore, it is necessary to recognize the importance of cherishing time ideologically in order to further correct this bad habit of not keeping meeting times.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Reader Li Jiahe
　　(2)
　　On the morning of the 25th of this month, nearly 600 people from various organs and schools in Gaoyou City (organized) listened to a current affairs report on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The notice was for 6 o'clock, but it did not start until 6:43, causing a loss of everyone's valuable time, and thus a significant loss to work.
　　On the same day, the Gaoyou County People's Government convened a summer health committee meeting. The notice was for 2 p.m., but it was delayed until 5 p.m. Only two-thirds of the attendees were present (21 were notified, but only 14 attended). Most of the participants arrived very early, but the hosts (Zhang Tingyou, director of the health center, and Wang Chang'an, chief of the civil affairs section) did not arrive at the venue on time, not arriving until 3:40 p.m., which weakened the participants' sense of time and mistakenly believed that "meetings will not be on time."
　　We believe that not keeping time is not only an old phenomenon but also a bad phenomenon that cannot be allowed to exist in today's new society. This kind of meeting where others arrive first has a very serious selfish ideology and is an old, decadent, and bad style. We hope that in the future, meeting participants, especially those who host the meetings, should take the lead by example and attach importance to it ideologically. They should strengthen their sense of punctuality and not regard this issue as a "minor matter in life." They should fully recognize the value of time and eliminate the phenomenon of not keeping time for meetings.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Shen Junzhi, Gaoyou County People's Government
　　Editor's note: Readers Li Jiahe and Shen Junzhi have raised the issue of not keeping meeting times and wasting everyone's time. This is something that should be given great attention by everyone because the loss it causes to work is significant.
　　Due to the existence of this bad style, over time, some people have even mistakenly developed the idea that "it's better to let people wait than to wait in vain by arriving early" or "it's better to arrive at the right time than to arrive early." In particular, some meeting hosts turn a blind eye to this, or even do it themselves, which has a worse impact.
　　It must be pointed out that the habit of not keeping meeting times is bad and reflects the laissez-faire, selfish, and self-interested attitudes of small producers and old intellectuals. It has nothing in common with our noble virtue of "not only cherishing our own time but also being good at cherishing the time of others." Therefore, local organs and organizations should wage a relentless struggle against this bad style that harms public interests at any time.
　　The Qingdao Handling Workers’ Poisoning Accident Has Been Effectively Prevented After Criticism and Self-Examination
Editor:
　　In the eleven months before May of this year, more than 360 workers in Qingdao were poisoned due to repeated lack of precautions when handling toxic substances. In response to the criticisms made by the masses in the Shandong Dazhong Daily, Beijing Workers’ Daily, and Beijing People’s Daily, the Qingdao Handling Company has made strict self-examinations, strengthened safety equipment, and stipulated safety systems. The situation has greatly improved. In May and June, a total of 215 handling operations involving toxic substances were carried out without a single case of poisoning. However, because the trains and freight yards were not disinfected after loading and transporting toxic substances, workers were subsequently poisoned four times when handling non-toxic substances in the same areas.
　　The Qingdao Handling Workers’ Union Committee and the Handling Company have learned from the lessons of the handling workers’ poisoning incidents, and have thoroughly self-examined and criticized the ideology of not relying on the working class among the cadres, such as some people regarding workers as coolies, believing that workers are backward, and being indifferent to the health and life and death issues of workers. The Handling Company conducted safety education for workers, and also purchased more than 1,000 pieces of various anti-toxic equipment such as gas masks, anti-toxic gloves, long rubber boots, goggles, masks, and face shields, and organized a dedicated handling team for handling toxic substances. The Handling Company has also stipulated the following system for handling toxic substances: (1) All toxic substances shall be handled by the Handling Company. Other workers and state-owned and private enterprises shall not handle them without authorization. (2) Before handling goods, the cargo owner must indicate the name, nature, and whether the goods are toxic on the cargo notice. Otherwise, the Handling Company may refuse to handle them. (3) Cargo owners who do not comply with the regulations for handling toxic substances and handling workers who violate discipline shall be given strict criticism and punishment in a timely manner. In addition, it is also recommended that the Qingdao Customs, Port Authority, and railway transportation departments disinfect trains, ships, and freight yards after loading and transporting toxic substances.

            哈尔滨部分工厂
            在基本建设工作中不断发生返工浪费编辑同志：
    人民日报从六月以来，连续报道了没有正确设计就施工而造成的损失，并专门发表了社论，我认为这是向基本建设中不负责任的、对祖国财富不关心的人敲警钟。现在就我所知道的情况，发表几点意见。
    首先，我认为“没有正确的设计就不可能施工”的问题，是非常重要的，而且也是目前某些单位存在较严重的问题。如哈尔滨制糖厂，修建工人俱乐部时，还未设计好就动工挖地基，挖了二天又说方向变了，只好改变；建设开始以后，现场监工员和工人不知是几层，楼已盖成，安上电影机，电光射在天棚上，只好拆掉重新做。该厂修建俱乐部由于一面设计一面动工，结果忘了设计便所及吸烟室。这都说明了没有正确工程设计，是不可能施工的。
    其次，我认为领导上不负责任不深入下层、不检查的官僚主义，不但会促使没有正确工程设计，而且即便有工程设计也会产生毛病。如哈尔滨制糖厂修建家属宿舍时，现场负责人以为是正房，所以将工程所需的沙子，完全拉在正房需要的地方。但又决定改为厢房也未告诉大家，结果又花了二百多工把沙子搬了家。诸如此类，能说是不懂业务管理或预算批迟了吗？
    根据以上情况，我认为领导干部深入下层，重视工程设计，基本建设上的错误是可以不发生或少发生的。这种认识我曾经与工人交谈过，他们也认为陈有功同志所提出的意见，是单纯强调客观原因，是替犯错误找借口。
    关于厂商不执行合同，未能按合同规定的日期交货，我认为首先应检查我们签订合同时尽到责任了没有，是否了解该厂商的生产力，合同中有没有规定质量标准及不执行合同时的罚款规则等项。如哈尔滨市自来水厂制造三百五十千伏安（电气设备的容量单位）的变压器，事前担任订合同的同志，不考虑该加工厂的生产能力技术条件，只认为反正是过去认识的老朋友，又是本厂出去的人开设的工厂，因之合同中规定只保证三年的寿命（一般需十年以上）。平日又不去检查工程进度情况，款项已支五十亿元，只买了二十九亿元材料，工程尚未动工。又如公用事业公司汽车厂与该公司领导的修造厂签订合同，只认为都是一个公司领导，谁还能欺骗谁，所以合同中只规定数量及一季度交货日期，并未订质量标准，结果废品很多，造成停工待料。实业公司毛织厂改进工人卫生设备制造洗棉机，但因为是交给认识的工厂做，只口头上讲了一下，结果制成半成品就超过了价格，只好不做，不但积压了资金，而且影响了工人卫生设备按期完成。诸如此类，能说是厂商不执行合同而造成施工不能进行吗？一切事物的发展外部的影响有他一定的作用，但决定事物变化的是内在因素，基本建设也不例外。总之我认为：我们作财经工作的应以老实的态度对待错误。

            应纠正不遵守会议时间的恶劣作风
    （一）
    现在各地严重存在着开会不守时间和会前未有充分准备的现象。例如：六月三日，中国人民赴朝慰问团代表，在贸易部礼堂召开报告大会，票上印的是下午一点开，实际是延迟到二点才开。七月一日，中国土产公司召开的一个大会，票上印的很清楚是上午七点半“准时开会”，可是七点半会场一人亦无，七点五十五分召集单位才来整理会场，九点多钟会才正式开始。
    这一类的例子举不胜举，实在是一种严重的恶劣习惯，应引起各领导机关的重视。像前所举的几个例子都造成很大的时间浪费，以中国土产公司所召开的大会来说，竟延迟到一个半小时，到会者以一千人计算吧，就浪费了一千五百小时，而所举第三例子中“全场三千人就浪费了三千小时”，这是多么严重的损失！所以必须从思想上认识珍惜时间的重要性，以便进一步纠正这种不遵守开会时间的恶劣习惯。
                      读者  李嘉禾
    （二）
    本月二十五日上午高邮城各机关、学校（有组织的）将近六百人左右在听取关于抗美援朝的时事报告，通知是六点，结果六点四十三分才开始，使大家宝贵的时间遭受损失，因之工作也遭受了重大损失。
    同日，高邮县人民政府召开夏令卫生委员会，通知是下午二时开会，结果拖到五点才开，出席人数仅三分之二（通知二十一人，实到十四人）。与会人员大都到得很早，而主持人（卫生院院长张廷猷、民政科科长王长安）却不准时到达会场，到三点四十分才到会场，因而减弱了与会者的时间观念，并错误地认为“开会不会准时的”。
    我们认为不遵守时间不但是一种老现象，而且是一种坏现象，在今天新社会里不能允许存在的。这种开会让别人先到有很严重的自私自利思想，是一种旧的腐朽的恶劣作风，希望今后开会人员特别是主持会议的人更应以身作则，从思想上重视起来，应加强守时观念，不能把这个问题看成是“生活上的小节”。应充分地认识时间宝贵，把不遵守时间开会的现象消灭。
      高邮县人民政府  沈俊芝
    编者按：读者李嘉禾、沈俊芝提出了开会不遵守时间、造成大家时间浪费的问题。这是应引起每一个人的高度注意的，因为它给工作造成的损失是重大的。
    由于这种不良作风的存在，时间长了，甚至有些人竟错误地产生了“早到会白等人，不如让人等”，或“到的早，不如到的巧”的想法。特别是某些会议的主持人对此熟视无睹，甚至自己也这样作，影响是更坏的。
    必须指出：不遵守会议时间的作风，是恶劣的，是小生产者、旧知识分子自由散漫、自私自利的反映。它与我们“不仅珍惜自己的时间，而且也善于珍惜别人的时间”的高尚品德毫无共同之点。因此，各地机关、团体，就应该随时向这种为害公共利益的坏作风进行不留情的斗争。
  青岛搬运工人中毒事故经过批评检讨已作有效防止编辑同志：
    青岛市在今年五月以前的十一个月中，因屡次搬运毒性物品时缺乏防备，曾有三百六十余工人中毒。对此，接连经山东大众日报、北京工人日报、北京人民日报发表了群众的批评后，青岛市搬运公司已作了严格检讨，加强了安全设备，规定了安全制度，情况已有很大改进，在五、六两月份中，共搬运毒性物品二百一十五次，未发生一次中毒的事情；但因列车、货场在装运毒性物品后未进行消毒，致使工人随后在该处搬运非毒性物品时，四次发生中毒。
    青岛市搬运工会委员会和搬运公司，接受了搬运工人中毒的教训，曾在干部中深入检讨和批判了不依靠工人阶级的思想，如某些人把工人看作苦力，认为工人落后，对工人的健康和生死问题漠不关心等。搬运公司向工人进行了安全教育，同时购置了防毒面具、防毒手套、长筒胶皮鞋、风镜、口罩和面罩等各种防毒器材一千余件，并组织了专门搬运毒性物品的搬运队。对搬运毒性物品，搬运公司并规定了以下制度：（一）一切毒性物品均由搬运公司负责搬运，其他工人和国营、私营企业不得擅自搬运。（二）货主在搬运货物之前，必须在货物通知单上写明货物的名称、性质、是否毒性物品，不然，搬运公司可以拒绝搬运。（三）对不遵守搬运毒性物品规定的货主及违犯纪律的搬运工人，要及时给以严格的批评及处分。此外，并建议青岛海关、港务局及铁路运输部门，列车、船只、货场在装运毒性物品后，应进行消毒。
