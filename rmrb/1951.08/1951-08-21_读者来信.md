Reader Letters

    My Erroneous Views Were Indeed Reversed After Reading "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun"
    Editor Comrades:
    After reading "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," my erroneous views of Wu Xun were indeed reversed. In the past, when studying "The Life of Wu Xun" and the Wu Xun problem, I always felt that Wu Xun's behavior of "begging to establish schools," regardless of its consequences, was motivated by good intentions. Also, Wu Xun, as portrayed in the film, seemed to have some revolutionary spirit, not an utterly reactionary and villainous scoundrel. Therefore, although I read many articles criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun" and Wu Xun, I still held prejudices in my mind, wanting to forgive him. It is difficult to correct such prejudices without concrete facts to prove them wrong.
    "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" tells me with facts that Wu Xun was a loyal lackey of the feudal rulers, a large landlord, a big usurer, a big rogue, a big swindler, and a lecher. What is there in his behavior that is worth praising and worshiping? On the contrary, what is there in his behavior that is not counter-revolutionary and anti-people?
    In addition, I also learned about a revolutionary leader—Song Jingshi, the leader of the Black Flag Army. Although his revolutionary struggle failed, his great will and deeds are deeply imprinted in my mind.
    Song Jingshi and Wu Xun are a good contrast. In the same region and at the same time, one led the peasants to raise the banner of uprising to resist the oppression of feudal forces, while the other kowtowed and bowed to the landlord class. This makes me even more despise Wu Xun. I strongly agree with some comrades' suggestions to shoot a movie and draw comic strips about "Song Jingshi and Wu Xun," because using these two tools to educate the masses can have a greater effect, allowing people to clearly see that Song Jingshi and Wu Xun represent two different classes at that time, and their actions represent two different paths. Thus, people can recognize who is revolutionary and who is counter-revolutionary, who is worthy of our praise and who should be spurned and overthrown. Wang Chongyi

    After Reading "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," I Recognized Wu Xun's Ugly Image
    Editor Comrades:
    I greedily finished reading "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" and felt that many articles discussing the Wu Xun problem published in newspapers and magazines are not as effective as this one in solving the problem.
    After reading "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," the image of Wu Xun in my mind has completely changed, utterly changed. The skinny and lonely Wu Xun who looked somewhat like Ah Q, whom I saw in some picture books, and the Wu Xun played by Zhao Dan in the movie who was "one bag, one bowl, covered in dust," have completely disappeared. Another image appeared before my eyes: a scowling, fleshy-faced, raggedly dressed, loudly begging wretch, with "a face this wide and a waist as thick as a cutting board." I have seen such evil beggars. Wu Xun sleeping at the entrance of the state official's office to collect debts from Zhang, the yamen runner, and singing, "Whoever tries to cheat me, Wu Qi, will bring misfortune to their old and young. They will get sores first, then get sick, and their family will die and be wiped out." Isn't this the behavior of an evil beggar? It's just that ordinary evil beggars don't carry a sign of "establishing righteous schools" like Wu Xun, who climbed into the yamen and the "houses of officials and gentry" and colluded with bureaucrats and landlords!
    After reading "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," I also felt that Wu Xun is not a "miracle" at all, let alone a "remarkable beggar of all time," but a completely genuine rogue. The propagandists of Wu Xun say that Wu Xun is a "laboring people" or a "reformist," which is all lies.
    I also feel that Marxism-Leninism is too great. Under the brilliant light of Marxism-Leninism, Wu Xun's rogue nature has finally been thoroughly exposed. In the future, I must link theory with practice, study Marxism-Leninism hard, and improve my level.

    Newspapers Should Seriously Handle Letters from the People to Chairman Mao
    Editor Comrades:
    Around the celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, people from all walks of life in Shanghai wrote letters to Chairman Mao to express their congratulations and respect. In addition to the letters directly sent to Chairman Mao, Shanghai newspapers also received 1,809 letters. The people who wrote these letters included combat heroes, model workers, activists in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, emancipated peasants after land reform, representatives of literature and art, science and technology, industrialists and businessmen, as well as young students, housewives, and children... In their letters, they reported their achievements in production, work, and study.
    Shanghai newspapers have generally handled these letters responsibly. In addition to selecting and publishing 103 representative letters, most of them were forwarded to the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. However, in the inspection of these "July 1st" letters, it was found that individual newspapers did not handle these letters quickly enough and lacked due attention. They were only sent to the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China after being urged by relevant departments. Take the Liberation Daily as an example; they treated these letters as ordinary letters and did not assign a specific person to be responsible for them. In order to improve this work, the newspaper formulated the following measures: (1) Assign a specific person to be responsible for separate registration; (2) Handle them in a timely manner; (3) Summarize regularly, raise problems, and report to the editorial board. This method is worth promoting and introducing.

    "Editor's Note" is an Important Method to Strengthen the Guidance of Newspapers
    Editor Comrades:
    The method of writing "Editor's Note" in newspapers and magazines is worth advocating and promoting. Because the "Editor's Note" can not only help readers understand the main content of an article but also strengthen the guidance of the newspaper. People's Daily, Shanghai Liberation Daily, Shanghai "New Education," "Northern Jiangsu Education," Beijing "Literary Gazette," and other newspapers and magazines, because they write more "Notes," are of great help to readers. For example, the article "The Importance and Principles of Acupuncture Therapy" (author: Zhu Lian), published in People's Daily on February 17 this year, was a specialized topic that was relatively difficult to understand, but because an "Note" was added, readers knew the significance, source, and background of the author, which attracted more attention from readers. This proves that the role of the "Note" is very important. However, some newspapers and magazines do not do a good job in "Note" work, or even do not use "Notes" at all. I suggest that newspapers and magazines in various places must add "Notes" when publishing more important articles in order to strengthen the guidance of the newspaper.

    A Serious Struggle Must Be Launched to Eliminate Pornographic Toxins in Old Literature and Art
    Editor's Note: After this newspaper published Comrade Beifeng's criticism of Liu Yong's "Eliminating Pornographic Toxins in Old Literature and Art" in the Xinmin Evening News on the 19th, we received a review from the General Editorial Office of the Xinmin Evening News and Liu Yong. The General Editorial Office of the Xinmin Evening News stated that it "will correct the mistakes and do a good job"; Liu Yong stated that he "initially realized the mistakes." Due to the small space in this column, the full text of the two letters will not be published. At the same time, we have successively received criticisms from Wang Chun, Xiao Li, Yao Shibing, Yin Chunmin, Ma Jun, Chen Min, Pei Fang, Gao Shaodong, and eight others on the erroneous text of Liu Yong published in the Xinmin Evening News. These criticisms are correct. We believe that this issue is not worth discussing further. Here, we will only select and publish Comrade Wang Chun's letter.
              Editor Comrades:
    The "Literary Criticism" column of the Beijing Xinmin Evening News on August 18 published Liu Yong's article "Eliminating Pornographic Toxins in Old Literature and Art." He copied an entire half-page of extremely obscene ditties and tried his best to provide the readers with their directory. I believe that such actions, which raise the banner of "progress" but actually do despicable and harmful things, are intolerable. I don't think this can be explained as due to the author's low political awareness, nor can it be explained as simply for the sake of earning some manuscript fees. This is a heinous reactionary behavior.
    The Xinmin Evening News has many readers in Beijing. The editors of the newspaper are irresponsible for allowing such works to be published, and even call it "literary criticism" and print it as a special issue. I think it is a shameful and appalling phenomenon.
    I hope your newspaper will publicly publish this letter to draw the attention of relevant parties.
        Wang Chun

专栏：读者来信

    读者来信
    读了《武训历史调查记》  我的错误看法确实扭转了编辑同志：
    读了《武训历史调查记》后，我对武训的错误看法才确确实实地扭转过来了。过去，我在学习《武训传》和武训问题的时候，总觉得武训“行乞兴学”的行为，不论它的后果怎样，动机总是好的，同时，在电影里表现出来的武训，多少也还有点革命性，并不是具有极端反动思想和行为的坏蛋。所以，我虽然读了许多批判《武训传》和武训的文章，但思想上还是存在着原谅他的偏见。这种偏见，如果没有具体事实来证明是很难纠正过来的。
    《武训历史调查记》用事实告诉了我，武训是封建统治者的忠实走狗、大地主、大债主、大流氓、大骗子、淫棍。他的行为，那一点值得我们歌颂和崇拜？相反地，他的行为，那一点不是反革命、反人民的？
    另外，我还认识了一个革命领袖——黑旗军领袖宋景诗，虽然他的革命斗争遭到了失败，但他伟大的意志和事迹，深深的印入了我的脑海。
    宋景诗和武训正是一个很好的对比，在同一地区、同一时期，一个是领导农民竖起义旗，反抗封建势力的压迫，而另一个却向地主阶级磕头、跪拜，这样，使我对武训更加鄙视，我很赞同有些同志关于拍摄《宋景诗和武训》的电影和绘制连环图画的建议，因为用这两种工具来对广大群众施行教育，更能有很大的效果，让人们清楚地看到宋景诗和武训是代表着当时两个不同的阶级，他们的行动正代表着两条不同的道路。从而认识到：谁是革命的，谁是反革命的，谁值得我们歌颂，谁应该被唾弃、打倒。  王崇一
    读了《武训历史调查记》我认清了武训的丑恶形象编辑同志：
    我贪婪地读完了《武训历史调查记》，觉得报刊上所发表的很多讨论武训问题的文章，都不如这一篇能解决问题。
    读完了《武训历史调查记》，武训在我脑筋里面的形象完全变了，彻底变了。从前在什么画传上看到过的那个瘦瘠伶仃，有些像阿Ｑ的武训，和电影里面赵丹饰演的那个“一囊一钵、仆仆风尘”的武训完全消逝了。我眼前幻出了另一个形象：一个横眉怒目，满脸横肉，身穿破衣，从事强讨的大叫化，“脸有这么宽，腰像案板那样粗”。这样的恶叫化我是见过的。武训睡在州官衙门口向张衙役讨账，和口里唱：“谁要把我武七坑，老的少的不安生。先长疮，后生病，人亡家破死个净。”不正是一个恶叫化的行为吗？只是普通的恶叫化没有掮上一块“兴义学”的招牌，不像武训爬进衙门和“大夫第”里面，和官僚地主结成了一伙罢了！
    读了《武训历史调查记》，我又感到：武训根本不是什么“奇迹”。更不是什么“千古奇丐”，而是一个完全道地的流氓。武训的宣传者们说武训是“劳动人民”，或者是“改良主义者”，这都是假话。
    我还觉得：马克思列宁主义太伟大了。武训的流氓本质，在马克思列宁主义的光辉照耀之下，终于彻底地暴露无遗。今后我一定要联系实际，努力学习马克思列宁主义，提高自己的水平。

    报纸应认真处理人民群众写给毛主席的信编辑同志：
    在庆祝中国共产党诞生三十周年前后，上海各界人民纷纷写信给毛主席，表示祝贺和敬意。他们除直接寄给毛主席的信以外，上海各报还收到一千八百零九封。写这些信的人，有战斗英雄、劳动模范、镇压反革命运动中的积极分子，有土地改革后的翻身农民、文学艺术、科学技术界的代表人物，有工商业家，也有青年学生、家庭妇女和少年儿童……。他们在信中报告了自己的生产、工作、学习的成绩。
    上海各报对于这些信件的处理，一般都是认真负责的。它们除选登了一百零三封有代表性的信以外，绝大部分都转送中共中央办公厅。但在检查这次“七一”来信的过程中，发现个别的报纸对此项信件的处理是不够迅速的，缺乏应有的重视。经有关部门催促以后，才寄送中共中央办公厅。就以解放日报来说，它们就是把这些信当作一般信件处理，也没有专人负责。该报为改进这一工作，曾订出了如下办法：（一）设专人负责，单独登记；（二）及时处理；（三）定期总结，提出问题，并向编委会汇报。这个办法，是颇值得推广与介绍的。

    “编者按语”是加强报纸的指导性的重要方法编辑同志：
    报纸、杂志写“编者按语”的方法，是值得提倡和推广的。因为“编者按语”既可以帮助读者了解某一篇文章的主要内容，又加强了报纸的指导性。人民日报、上海解放日报、上海《新教育》、《苏北教育》、北京《文艺报》等报刊，因“按语”写得比较多，对读者的帮助就很大。例如今年二月十七日人民日报刊登的《针灸疗法的重要性及其原理》（作者朱琏）一文，本是一篇专门性的论题，比较难懂，但因为加了“按语”，使读者知道了该文的意义、来源和作者的背景，就更能引起读者的注意。这就证明“按语”的作用是很大的。但有一些报纸、杂志的“按语”工作做得不够好，甚或根本不用“按语”。我建议各地的报纸和杂志，在刊载较重要的文章时，编者一定要加“按语”，以加强报纸的指导性。

    为清除旧文艺中的色情毒素要展开严肃的斗争
    编者按：本报于十九日发表了北风同志对流涌在新民报所作的《清除旧文艺中的色情毒素》一文的批评后，我们收到了新民报总编室和流涌的检讨。新民报总编室表示“会改正错误，搞好工作的”；流涌表示“初步认识了错误”。因本栏篇幅太小，不登两封信的全文了。同时，我们又连续收到王春、萧离、姚石冰、殷纯忞、马俊、晨民、佩芳、高绍东等八人对新民报发表流涌的这一错误文字的批评。这些批评都是正确的。我们认为这个问题不值得多展开讨论，在这里只选登王春同志的来信。
              编辑同志：
    八月十八日的北京新民报《文艺批评》专栏刊登流涌的《清除旧文艺中的色情毒素》一文。他把极猥亵的臭小调抄了整整半版，还把它们的目录尽量开给读者。像这种打起“进步”招牌，实际上在做卑鄙害人的事情的行动，我认为是不可忍受的。我认为这不可能解释为由于作者政治认识低，也不可能解释为单是为弄几文稿费。这是一种可恶的反动行为。
    新民报在北京市民中有不少读者，该报编者不负责任，对这样作品容其出版，还名之曰《文艺批评》，印成专刊，我觉得是可耻的与骇人听闻的现象。
    我希望贵报公开发表这封信，以引起有关方面的注意。
        王春
