　　China's Youth Delegation to the Festival Holds Joint Celebration with Youth Representatives from Twenty-Two European, American, and Australian Countries
    Representatives from Various Countries Give Speeches Guaranteeing Eternal Friendship with Chinese Youth
    【Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 15th】The Chinese youth delegation participating in the World Youth Festival held a joint celebration on the 13th at the Berlin Electrical Equipment Factory building with youth representatives from twenty-two countries in Europe, America, and Australia. More than 600 youth representatives from France, the United States, Britain, Canada, Italy, Spain, Greece, Denmark, the Netherlands, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Austria, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries attended. Feng Wenbin, head of the Chinese youth delegation, said in his speech: The common aspiration for peace unites the youth of the world. The victory won by the Chinese youth and the entire Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong is inseparable from world peace. The Chinese people are simultaneously fighting for peace in national construction and on the front lines of resisting America and aiding Korea. Feng Wenbin concluded: When you return home, please convey the Chinese people's and Chinese youth's desire for peace to the people of your countries.
    The French representative, who spoke first, said: The working people and youth of France unreservedly support the proposal put forward by the People's Republic of China for a peaceful settlement of the Korean War. The French youth extend fraternal greetings to the Chinese youth.
    The American youth representative said: "American youth believe that this gathering with Chinese youth is of historical significance. Although American youth are being forced to fight alongside Chinese youth on the Korean front, this celebration shows the common will of American and Chinese youth to defend peace. The American people and youth have a better understanding of the true meaning of the Korean War. The Chinese people are helping the American people in their struggle for peace through their just struggle in Korea. We guarantee that we will not be deceived by any slander the American government is conducting against the People's Republic of China, and we guarantee that American youth will be eternally friendly to Chinese youth." Then, a black youth read a letter sent back from the Korean front on June 9, stating that American soldiers in Korea did not want to fight against Chinese youth.
    A British youth representative paid tribute to the Chinese youth on behalf of the 1,300 British youth and students participating in the festival. He said: "Despite imperialist propaganda, we, the British people and British youth, are expressing our friendship to the Chinese people in every way. In recent months, a vigorous movement for peace with China has unfolded. Many British youth are demanding the conclusion of a five-power peace pact."
    In their speeches, the Italian and Spanish youth representatives expressed their willingness to strengthen friendship with Chinese youth in order to carry out the struggle against American imperialism and for national independence.
    The celebration proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The Chinese youth delegation exchanged gifts with youth representatives from various countries, and finally there was a performance of artistic programs.
