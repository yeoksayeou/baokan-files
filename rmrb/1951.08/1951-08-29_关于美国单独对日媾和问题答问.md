Questions and Answers Concerning the US's Separate Peace Treaty with Japan

(Question) What is the main purpose of the US's separate peace treaty with Japan?

(Answer) The US has unilaterally decided to convene the so-called "San Francisco Peace Conference" on September 4th, preparing to sign a separate peace treaty based on the so-called "Definitive Text of the Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" published by the US and British governments on August 15th (this "definitive text" is essentially the same as the "Revised Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" published by the US and Britain on July 12th), implementing a separate peace treaty with Japan. This action by the US is illegal. The central purpose of the US's separate peace treaty with Japan is to attempt, in an open and "legal" form, to let Japan rearm itself without restraint, and to use Japan as a tool for launching new wars, in preparation for expanding aggression in Asia.

The US plans to sign the "US-Japan Military Agreement," the "US-Australia-New Zealand Security Treaty," and the "US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty" at the same time as signing the separate peace treaty with Japan, using the false pretexts of "security" and "peace" to tightly bind the countries of the Pacific to the US's war chariot. The US will use the "Peace Treaty with Japan" and the "US-Japan Military Agreement" to finally pull Japan into the "Pacific Pact" aggressive bloc, making Japan the core force of the Pacific aggression alliance and the main tool for the US to launch new wars of aggression in the East. This sinister plot of the US can be clearly seen from the "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" it has published.

(Question) Why is the US-British separate peace treaty draft illegal? What kind of treaty is it?

(Answer) The US-British draft peace treaty with Japan completely violates all international agreements concerning the Japan issue in its preparation process and content. The US government not only violated the provisions of the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942, regarding not concluding a separate peace with enemy countries, but also violated the principle of the Potsdam Agreement stipulating that the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Five Great Powers should prepare the peace treaty. The US government, in secret collusion with the British government, monopolized the preparation of the peace treaty, while excluding most of the countries that fought against Japan, especially our country and the Soviet Union, which played a decisive role in the struggle to defeat Japan, from the preparation of the peace treaty. The so-called "San Francisco Conference" unilaterally convened by the US even excluded the People's Republic of China, which had resisted Japan the longest and contributed the most. These illegal measures by the US are intolerable to the Chinese people and must be resolutely opposed.

From the main content of the US-British separate peace treaty draft with Japan, we know that the essence of this treaty is a treaty preparing for a new war, not a peace treaty. First, on the territorial issue, the US completely violated the provisions of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, attempting to annex China's sacred territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and also added clauses in this draft and the so-called "definitive text" published for the last time, attempting to encroach on China's territory of the Xisha Islands and Nansha Islands. At the same time, the US is also attempting to infringe upon the Soviet Union's sovereignty over the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin. The US is even plotting to plunder Japanese islands such as the Ryukyu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, Nishinoshima, the Volcano Islands, Okinotori Island, and Minamitori Island in the name of "trusteeship." Second, the US-made draft peace treaty with Japan does not contain clauses prohibiting the revival of Japanese militarism and restricting Japanese armaments. On the contrary, it expresses its intention to step up the arming of Japan. In the "Security" chapter of the draft peace treaty, Japan is allowed to participate in "collective security agreements" (i.e., aggressive blocs) in the name of "self-defense," stipulating that Japan "endeavor to assist" actions taken by the so-called United Nations. This means that the US will use Japan to carry out new wars of aggression. The US will occupy military bases in Japan, station troops there for a long time, and use Japan's manpower and material resources to serve its future wars of aggression according to the "US-Japan Military Agreement." Third, the US-made draft does not contain political clauses guaranteeing the democratic rights of the Japanese people; economically, the US is plotting to completely control Japan's economy, accelerate arms production, and make Japan a military arsenal for the US to invade the Far East. For the Japanese people, the US-British separate peace treaty draft with Japan is a contract of national subjugation and betrayal. This treaty will bring the disaster of a new war to the Japanese people.

(Question) What role will the Soviet Union play in participating in the San Francisco Conference? What is the attitude of Asian countries towards the US-British separate peace treaty draft?

(Answer) The Soviet Union's decision to send a delegation to participate in the San Francisco Conference and to submit the Soviet government's proposals on the peace treaty with Japan will seriously undermine the US's conspiracy to manipulate the conclusion of a separate peace treaty. The Soviet Union has always insisted on concluding a fair, reasonable, and comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. The US and its satellite countries are very worried that the Soviet Union will put forward such proposals at the San Francisco Conference. They are afraid that the result of the Soviet Union's speaking out for justice may "cause the set of machinery painstakingly pieced together by Dulles (referring to the San Francisco Conference manipulated by the US) to disintegrate" (Agence France-Presse). The US group has therefore expressed panic. After the Soviet Union announced its participation in the San Francisco Conference, Dulles arrogantly announced on August 15th that the US-made draft peace treaty was a "definitive draft agreement" that "countries participating in the San Francisco Conference must not change," and that they were invited only "to sign the draft agreement." This shows that the US is planning to use despicable means to restrict the Soviet Union's right to speak, attempting to obstruct the Soviet Union and other countries from putting forward proposals for concluding a fair and reasonable comprehensive peace treaty with Japan at the conference.

The US-British separate peace treaty draft with Japan has aroused widespread opposition from the people of Asian countries, and has also dissatisfied the governments of many Asian countries. The Indian government has suggested that Taiwan should be returned to China in accordance with the Cairo Declaration; that the provision for foreign troops to be stationed in Japan should be abandoned because it undermines Japanese sovereignty; and that the proposal to "trustee" the Ryukyu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands should also be abandoned. Because these suggestions were rejected by the US, the Indian government has refused to attend the San Francisco Conference. According to a Reuters telegram on the 19th, the Burmese government has also decided not to attend the San Francisco Conference. The Indonesian government sent a note to the United States suggesting that the clauses recognizing Japanese sovereignty should be restored; that it hoped to obtain fair and just compensation; and that it should support the wishes of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union to participate in the San Francisco Conference. Even the Philippine government has put forward the opinion that it should receive compensation from Japan. However, the US government has brazenly rejected most of the opinions put forward by these countries, which fairly reflect the demands of the people of those countries, and has only hypocritically made some verbal revisions in the "definitive draft" in an attempt to muddle through.

(Question) Our Chinese people resolutely oppose the US imperialists' conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan. What are our main tasks today?

(Answer) The US government, ignoring the legitimate rights of the governments and peoples of China and the Soviet Union, as well as the peoples of all countries, is attempting to monopolize the peace treaty with Japan single-handedly in order to achieve its aggressive goals. This shameless act of US imperialism has been widely and resolutely opposed. In the struggle surrounding the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, hundreds of millions of people in Asia and around the world stand on our side.

We know that the most decisive factor is not the treaty of imperialism, but the power of the people. The US-made peace treaty with Japan is a treaty preparing for war, a treaty that is hostile to the people of China and the Soviet Union, the people of Asia, the people of Japan, and the people of all countries. The US imperialism's determination to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan is also a determination to be hostile to the people of all countries. The more thoroughly this sinister face of US imperialism is exposed, the more isolated it will become, and the more and more opposition its conspiracy to arm Japan to invade Asia will encounter.

We Chinese people love peace, and we bravely shoulder the great responsibility of defending peace and security in Asia. Our volunteers are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield, heavily striking the American aggressors. More than 330 million of our Chinese people have voted against the US arming Japan. We Chinese people are soberly and persistently defending peace in the Far East. We Chinese people defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries fully supported by the United States in the past. Today, we have united to become a powerful force, and we also have the powerful Soviet Union as our ally. Therefore, we must have the power to defeat the United States' arrogant plan to use Japan to attack China. In order to oppose the US's separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearming of Japan to invade China and Asia, the most important task for our people throughout the country is to further implement the three major calls of the General Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, to further improve the political and ideological level of the people throughout the country, and to do our best to strengthen our national defense forces. Only by strengthening the actual struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea can the American aggressors be more severely hit; only with a consolidated and strong national defense force can we defend our country and people, and can we guarantee peace in Asia.

### 关于美国单独对日媾和问题答问

　　关于美国单独对日媾和问题答问
    （问）美国单独对日媾和的主要目的是什么？
    （答）美国片面决定将于九月四日召集所谓“旧金山对日和会”，准备根据美英两国政府于八月十五日公布的所谓“对日和约草案定本”（这个“定本”和美英七月十二日公布的“对日和约修正草案”本质上完全相同）签订单独对日和约，实行单独对日媾和。美国这种行动是非法的。美国单独对日媾和的中心目的，就是企图用公开与“合法”的形式，放手重新武装日本，利用日本充当它发动新战争的工具，以准备扩大在亚洲的侵略。
    美国打算在签订单独对日和约时，同时签订“美日军事协定”、“美、澳、新三国安全条约”和“美菲联防条约”，以“安全”与“和平”的虚伪借口，将太平洋各国家紧紧缚在美国的兵车上。美国将利用“对日和约”和“美日军事协定”，最后把日本拉进“太平洋公约”侵略集团中去，使日本成为太平洋侵略同盟的核心力量，成为美国在东方发动新的侵略战争的主要工具。美国这一罪恶阴谋从它公布的“对日和约草案”中可以清楚地看出来。
    （问）美英单独对日和约草案为什么是非法的？它是什么性质的条约？
    （答）美英对日和约草案在准备程序上和内容上完全破坏了一切有关日本问题的国际协议。美国政府不仅违反了一九四二年一月一日的联合国宣言关于不得与敌国单独媾和的规定，而且违反了波茨坦协定规定的由五大国外长会议准备和约工作的原则。美国政府与英国政府私下勾结，包办和约准备工作，而排斥大多数对日作战国家，尤其是在打败日本的斗争中起决定作用的我国和苏联于和约准备工作之外，而由美国片面召集的所谓“旧金山和会”，也竟将抗日最久、出力最多的中华人民共和国排斥在外。美国这些非法措施是我们中国人民不能容忍而且必须坚决反对的。
    我们从美英单独对日和约草案的主要内容上看，就知道这个条约的实质是一个准备新战争的条约，而不是什么和平条约。第一、在领土问题上，美国完全破坏了开罗宣言和波茨坦公告的规定，企图并吞我国的神圣领土台湾和澎湖列岛，而且又在这个草案和最后一次公布的所谓“定案”中加上了企图侵犯我国领土西沙群岛和南威岛的条款。同时，美国并企图侵犯苏联对千岛群岛和南库页岛的主权。美国更阴谋以“托管”的名义，掠夺琉球群岛、小笠原群岛、西之岛、琉璜群岛、冲之鸟岛和南鸟岛等日本的岛屿。第二、在美制对日和约草案中没有禁止日本军国主义复活与限制日本武装的条款。相反地，却表示要加紧武装日本。在和约草案的“安全”一章中，允许日本在“自卫”的名义下，参加“集体安全协定”（即侵略集团），规定日本“尽力协助”所谓联合国采取的行动。这就意味着美国将利用日本来进行新的侵略战争。美国将根据“美日军事协定”占用日本的军事基地、长期驻留军队，并利用日本的人力和物力，为它的未来的侵略战争服务。第三、美制草案中没有保障日本人民民主权利的政治条款；在经济上，美国阴谋全部控制日本的经济，加速军火生产，使日本成为美国侵略远东的兵工厂。对于日本人民来说，美英单独对日和约草案，就是日本人民的亡国的卖身契约。这个条约，将给日本人民带来新战争的灾祸。
    （问）苏联参加旧金山会议将起什么作用？亚洲各国对美英单独和约草案的态度如何？
    （答）苏联决定派遣代表团参加旧金山会议，并将提出苏联政府关于对日和约的建议，这将严重地打击美国操纵缔结单独对日和约的阴谋计划。苏联一向坚持应缔结一个公平合理的全面的对日和约。美国和它的仆从国家非常担心苏联在旧金山会议上提出这样的建议。他们害怕苏联仗义执言的结果，可能“使杜勒斯苦心拼凑好的一套机器（指美国摆布的旧金山会议）分崩离析”（法新社），美国集团已因此表示慌乱。在苏联宣布参加旧金山会议后，杜勒斯即于八月十五日横蛮地宣布：美制和约草案是“参加旧金山会议的国家不得予以更改”的“绝对的草约定案”，它们被邀请，仅是“要它们在草约上签字”。这说明美国正打算用卑劣的手段限制苏联的发言权，妄图阻挠苏联和其他国家在和会上提出缔结公平合理的全面对日和约的建议。
    美英单独对日和约草案已引起亚洲各国人民的普遍反对，而且也使许多亚洲国家的政府不满。印度政府曾建议台湾应根据开罗宣言归还中国；外国军队驻扎日本的规定应予放弃，因为这损害日本主权；“托管”琉球群岛与小笠原群岛的建议也应放弃。由于这些建议被美国所拒绝，印度政府已拒绝出席旧金山会议。另据路透社十九日电讯报道，缅甸政府也已决定不出席旧金山会议。印尼政府照会美国，建议应恢复承认日本主权的条款；希望获得公平而正当的赔偿；应支持中华人民共和国和苏联参加旧金山会议的愿望。甚至就是菲律宾政府也提出了应获得日本的赔偿的意见。然而，美国政府对这些国家提出的相当反映了各该国人民的要求的意见的大部分都予以悍然拒绝，只是假惺惺地在“草案定本”中作了一些词句上的修正，以图敷衍了事。
    （问）我们中国人民是坚决反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和的阴谋的，今天我们主要的任务是什么呢？
    （答）美国政府无视中苏两国政府和人民以及各国人民的合法权利，妄图一手遮天包办对日和约，达到它的侵略目的，美帝国主义这一无耻行动已遭到广泛和坚决的反对。在围绕对日和约这一问题的斗争中，亿万亚洲的和世界各国的人民是站在我们一边的。
    我们知道，最具有决定性因素的并不是帝国主义的一纸条约而是人民的力量。美制对日和约是准备战争的条约，是与中苏两国人民、亚洲人民、日本人民以及世界各国人民为敌的条约，美帝国主义决心签订单独对日和约，也就是决心与各国人民为敌。美帝国主义这一凶恶面目暴露得愈彻底，它便愈孤立，它武装日本侵略亚洲的阴谋计划便会遭到愈来愈大的反对。
    我们中国人民是爱好和平的，并且我们勇敢地担负着保卫亚洲和平与安全的伟大责任。我们的志愿军在朝鲜战场上与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，沉重地打击着美国侵略者。我们中国人民有三亿三千万以上的人民投票反对美国武装日本。我们中国人民清醒地而且坚持不渝地捍卫着远东的和平。我们中国人民在过去打败了日本帝国主义和美国所全力支持的国民党反动派，在今天我们已经团结起来成为强大的力量，而且我们又有强大的苏联作为我们的同盟国，因此，我们一定有力量打败美国利用日本进攻中国的狂妄计划。为着反对美国单独对日媾和、重新武装日本侵略中国和亚洲，我们全国人民最重要的任务，就是要进一步执行抗美援朝总会的三大号召，使全国人民在政治思想方面更提高一步，并用全力增强我们的国防力量。只有加强抗美援朝的实际斗争，才能使美国侵略者受到更大的打击；只有有了巩固的强大的国防力量，才能捍卫我们的国家和人民，才能保障亚洲的和平。
