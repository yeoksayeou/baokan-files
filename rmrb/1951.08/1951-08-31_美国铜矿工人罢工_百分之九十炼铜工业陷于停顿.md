　　US Copper Miners Strike
    Ninety Percent of Copper Smelting Industry Shut Down
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 29th dispatch from New York] 58,000 American copper miners began a strike on August 27th to protest the capitalists' refusal to meet the workers' demands for increased wages, improved pensions, and paid holiday wages. The International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, which is leading the copper miners' strike, announced that the strike will not stop unless the capitalists accept the workers' demands.
    Currently, ninety percent of the copper smelting industry in the United States has been shut down. According to US newspapers, the strike may spread to other enterprises of major mining and smelting companies. Clark, the president of the Mine Workers Union, which has 80,000 members, recently denounced the major companies for flatly rejecting the workers' demands while they themselves are obtaining huge profits by exploiting the workers.
    This copper miners' strike has greatly shaken the US government. According to the Associated Press, US Department of Defense officials admitted: "This strike has hit the weakest point in the mobilization movement because copper is the scarcest of the major metals." At the same time, "the strike has also affected the production of zinc, lead, and silver."

### 美国铜矿工人罢工  百分之九十炼铜工业陷于停顿

　　美国铜矿工人罢工
    百分之九十炼铜工业陷于停顿
    【新华社二十九日讯】纽约消息：五万八千名美国铜矿工人已自八月二十七日起开始罢工，抗议资方拒绝工人提出的增加工资、提高养老金、假期工资照付的要求。领导铜矿工人罢工的国际开采冶炼工人工会方面宣布：除非资方接受工人的要求，罢工将决不停止。
    目前，美国全国百分之九十的炼铜工业已陷于停顿，据美国报纸猜测：罢工还可能蔓延到各大矿冶公司的其他企业中去。拥有八万名会员的矿业工人工会主席克拉克日前曾痛斥各大公司断然拒绝工人们的要求，它们自己却由于剥削工人而获得巨额利润。
    这次铜矿工人的罢工，使美国官方大为震动。据合众社透露，美国防部官员供认：“这次罢工正好打中了动员运动中最弱的一点，因为铜是主要金属中最稀少的一种。”同时，“罢工也影响了锌、铅和银的生产。”
