Xinhua News Agency Report: Shanghai, various locations in the Central South Region, Nanchong City in the North Sichuan Region, Hejian County in Hebei Province, and other local people's governments are actively relying on the people to clear counter-revolutionary cases.

The Shanghai Municipal People's Court, with the assistance of the broad masses of the people, processed 2,069 counter-revolutionary criminals in batches in just half a month. In dealing with these counter-revolutionaries, the anti-revolutionary case review committees in various districts and the anti-counter-revolutionary committees in basic units mobilized citizens to provide criminal materials and evidence of counter-revolutionaries, and to offer opinions on sentencing for the reference of public security and judicial organs. The anti-counter-revolutionary committees of basic units in the North Railway Station District held mass meetings to discuss counter-revolutionary cases sent by public security and judicial organs. In some places, the masses provided many supplementary materials on the crimes of counter-revolutionaries. For example, Chu Jinpeng, the captain of the bandit "People's Self-Defense Model Brigade," tried to quibble during interrogation. However, at a mass meeting to discuss this case, Wu Jiafeng, who had served as Chu's orderly, specifically provided evidence of Chu's crimes and assisted public security personnel in searching out Chu's privately hidden guns and counter-revolutionary documents, making it impossible for Chu to deny the charges.

The people's governments of six large and medium-sized cities, including Wuhan, Guangzhou, Kaifeng, and Guilin in the Central South Region, and sixteen counties, including Chaling County in Hunan Province and Lanfeng County in Henan Province, had cleared 7,598 pending cases by the beginning of July. The main method for clearing pending cases in various places was to rely on the broad masses of the people for joint review. In cities, enlarged meetings of the Pending Case Clearing Committees were held, and in rural areas, meetings of district and township people's representatives were held. At the meetings, the heads of the people's governments first explained the significance and policies of clearing pending cases, and then handed over the list of criminals and materials on their crimes to the committee members or representatives for joint review, who would put forward opinions on how to handle the cases, and finally, report them to the relevant authorities for approval. Hengyang Prefecture in Hunan Province and Chao'an and Shantou in Guangdong Province adopted the above methods and processed 5,856 counter-revolutionary criminals in a short period of time. When dealing with pending cases, Zunqiao and Tieshan Districts in Shangrao County, Jiangxi Province, convened meetings at the district, township, and village levels, absorbing more than 33,000 people's representatives and activists to participate, and preliminarily completed the handling of pending cases in the two districts within eight days. In clearing pending cases, various places implemented the policy of combining suppression with leniency. For example, when Hengyang Prefecture relied on the people to handle 4,532 counter-revolutionary criminals, in addition to sentencing some to death and imprisonment, 3,117 people who had committed minor crimes and showed repentance and meritorious service were released. Six provinces in the Central South Region, as well as large and medium-sized cities such as Wuhan, Guangzhou, Kaifeng, and Guilin, and most prefectures and counties have established pending case clearing committees. Moreover, in order to ensure the rapid and smooth completion of the work of clearing pending cases, in addition to the four work groups sent by the Central People's Government to the Central South Region, the Central South Administrative Region organized 26 work groups at the first level, and Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other places organized 32 work groups and inspection groups to go to various places to carry out their work.

The Nanchong Municipal People's Government in the North Sichuan Region mobilized the broad masses of the people to assist in clearing counter-revolutionary cases. First, the municipal people's government printed and distributed the materials of 40 criminals who had been reviewed by the city's Counter-Revolutionary Case Review Committee and their preliminary handling opinions, together with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," to various residents' groups and various organs, organizations, schools, factories, etc., asking people from all walks of life to discuss them separately and put forward opinions on sentencing. At the same time, publicity was carried out through blackboard newspapers, rooftop broadcasts, and leaflets. Within two days, 84 night schools and 1,100 residents' groups with nearly 60,000 residents in the city held discussion meetings. The Municipal Public Security Bureau then convened symposiums for security representatives from all walks of life and symposiums for family members of counter-revolutionaries, organizing them to discuss separately, explaining the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries to the family members of counter-revolutionaries, eliminating their concerns, and calling on them to draw a clear line between themselves and the enemy and assist the government in handling counter-revolutionary cases. People from all walks of life were extremely serious in the discussions. After discussing the crimes of these counter-revolutionaries, they wrote more than 3,000 letters of accusation to the municipal people's government, demanding that the government resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries. The Nanchong Municipal People's Government made appropriate revisions to the handling of certain cases based on the opinions of people from all walks of life, and then submitted them to the Nanchong Municipal People's Representatives' Consultative Committee for case-by-case review, and submitted them to the North Sichuan People's Administrative Office for approval. After being approved by the Administrative Office, the Municipal People's Court convened a public trial of more than 20,000 people and sentenced 40 counter-revolutionary criminals to death, imprisonment, or release under supervision.

When cleaning up counter-revolutionary cases, the public security and judicial organs of Hejian County and Tong County in Hebei Province carried case files to the countryside and mobilized the masses to evaluate cases and determine sentences, so that the work of clearing pending cases was completed quickly and correctly. After studying the situation of pending counter-revolutionary cases in the county, the Hejian County Counter-Revolutionary Case Trial Committee decided to first carry out the clearing in the Second District. Small-scale meetings of mass representatives were convened, and the heads of victimized households were invited to participate, leading the masses to review the crimes of the defendants and asking the masses to supplement and put forward opinions on handling the cases. As a result, all cases were judged correctly. For example, Yang Chunfeng, a counter-revolutionary criminal in Xiliuzhuang, was originally prepared for release, but after representatives from the village and family members of the victims presented more detailed materials on his crimes, he was re-sentenced. In the case of Liu Shulin, a counter-revolutionary element in Laolinzhuang, the family members of the victim proved that the shooting was accidental, and he was given a lighter sentence. Thanks to the active help of the masses, the work team closed 16 cases a day. The pending cases in the entire district were cleared in three days. The People's Judicial Organs of Tong County submitted 38 counter-revolutionary criminals to more than 7,000 residents in 22 villages and 4 streets for case evaluation and sentencing. The working cadres first reported the case and the sentencing standards, and then everyone discussed in groups. As a result of the residents' discussion, the original death sentences of 14 people remained unchanged, death sentences with a two-year reprieve and forced labor to see how they would behave were changed from 5 to 1 executed immediately; of the 10 people sentenced to imprisonment, 2 were changed to death sentences, 2 were changed to death sentences with a two-year reprieve, and 1 was released; and of the 9 people originally planned for release, 1 was changed to imprisonment. These changes were more correct and reasonable than the original sentences.

The Yangliuqing Town People's Government in Hebei Province invited people's representatives from all walks of life to form a case-clearing committee to investigate, study, interrogate, and sentence counter-revolutionary criminals, quickly cleared the pending counter-revolutionary cases, and accurately reflected the policy of combining suppression and leniency in the judgments. In ten days, the case-clearing committee cleared a total of 47 cases. The initial trial results were: 2 people were sentenced to death, 2 people were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, and the rest were sentenced to imprisonment or released under supervision.

The above-mentioned reliance on the masses to clear counter-revolutionary cases in various places was not only rapid but also accurate, and was supported and praised by the broad masses of the people. The people of Nanchong City in the North Sichuan Region praised it, saying: "It is truly accurate in killing, correct in imprisoning, appropriate in releasing, and quick in handling." The people of Hejian and Tong Counties in Hebei Province said: "The government has given us great power, and we must be cautious, make fair judgments, and neither let one go nor kill one by mistake." The people's representatives who participated in the case-clearing work in various places were very active and further recognized the essence of the people's democratic regime, and jointly felt that the people had indeed become the masters of the country. Even many counter-revolutionary elements under supervision honestly confessed their guilt to the people, expressing their willingness to reform themselves through labor under the government's supervision and the people's supervision.

　　上海和中南区等地许多城市与县份
    依靠群众积极清理反革命案件
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上海市、中南区各地及川北区南充市、河北省河间县等地人民政府，积极依靠人民群众清理反革命案件。
    上海市人民法院在短短半个月内，在广大人民的协助下，分批处理了两千零六十九名反革命罪犯。在处理这些反革命分子时，全市各区反革命案件审查委员会和各基层单位的肃清反革命委员会，都发动市民群众提供反革命分子的犯罪材料与证据，并提出处刑的意见，以供公安、司法机关参考。北站区各基层单位肃清反革命委员会，曾分别召开群众大会，逐件讨论由公安、司法机关送来的反革命案件。有些地方群众对反革命分子的罪行提出了很多的补充材料。如匪“民众自卫模范大队”中队长褚匪金鹏，在审讯时多方狡辩。但在群众会上讨论这一案件时，曾当过褚匪勤务兵的吴家峰就具体地提供了褚匪的犯罪证据，并协助公安人员搜出了褚匪私藏的枪支和反革命证件，使褚匪无法狡赖。
    中南区武汉、广州、开封、桂林等六个大、中城市和湖南省茶陵、河南省兰封等十六个县的人民政府，截至七月初止，已清理积案七千五百九十八件。各地清理积案的主要方法，是依靠广大人民群众共同审查。在城市里，举行清理积案委员会扩大会议，在农村里举行区、乡人民代表会议。会上，人民政府负责人首先说明清理积案的意义和政策，然后把罪犯名单和罪行材料交给委员或代表，由大家共同审查，提出处理意见，最后，逐级呈报有关机关批核。湖南衡阳专区和广东省潮安、汕头等地采取上述办法，在短期内就处理了五千八百五十六名反革命罪犯。江西省上饶县尊桥、铁山两区在处理积案时，召开了区、乡、村各级会议，吸收了三万三千多人民代表与积极分子参加，八天内就把两个区内的积案初步处理完毕。各地在清理积案时，执行了镇压与宽大相结合的政策。如衡阳专区依靠人民群众处理四千五百三十二名反革命犯时，除判处死刑及徒刑的以外，释放了罪轻、有悔过立功表现的三千一百一十七人。中南六个省及武汉、广州、开封、桂林等大、中城市与大部分的专区和县都分别成立了清理积案委员会。而且，为了保证清理积案工作迅速、顺利地完成，除中央人民政府派到中南的四个工作组外，中南大行政区一级组织二十六个工作组，河南、湖北、湖南、广东、广西等地组织了三十二个工作组与检查组，分赴各地进行工作。
    川北区南充市人民政府发动广大人民协助清理反革命案件。首先，该市人民政府将已经该市处理反革命案件审查委员会审查过的四十名案犯的材料和初步处理意见，连同“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”一并印发给各居民小组和各机关、团体、学校、工厂等，请各界人民分别讨论和提出处刑意见。同时，并利用黑板报、屋顶广播和传单等方式进行宣传。两日之内，全市就有八十四个夜校和一千一百个居民小组近六万居民开了讨论会。该市公安局接着又召开了各界治安代表座谈会和反革命分子家属座谈会，分别组织他们讨论，并向反革命分子家属解释镇压反革命的政策，消除其顾虑，号召他们与反革命分子划清敌我界线，协助政府处理反革命案件。各界人民在讨论中极为认真，在讨论了这些反革命分子的罪行后，一共写了三千多封控诉书给市人民政府，要求政府坚决镇压反革命。南充市人民政府根据各界人民的意见，对某些案犯的处理办法作了适当修正，然后送交该市各界人民代表会议协商委员会逐案审查，并呈请川北人民行政公署批准。经行署批准后，该市人民法庭召开了二万余人的公审大会分别宣判四十名反革命罪犯的死刑、徒刑或释放管制。
    河北省河间县和通县的公安、司法机关，在清理反革命案件时，携带案卷下乡，发动群众评案量刑，使清理积案工作迅速而正确地完成。河间县反革命案件审判委员会在研究了该县反革命积案的情况后，决定先在第二区进行清理。分别召开了小型的群众代表会议，并邀请受害户户主参加，领导群众对各案犯的罪行进行审查，请群众补充和提出处理意见，结果各案都判得很正确。如西刘庄反革命案犯杨春峰，原准备释放，经该村代表和被害人家属提出更详细的罪行材料后，又重新量刑。老林庄反革命分子刘树林的人命案，经被害人家属证明是枪走火误伤，又从轻处刑。由于群众的积极帮助，工作组一天结案十六件。全区积案三天便清理完毕。通县人民司法机关曾将三十八名反革命案犯，分别提交二十二个村和四条街的七千多居民群众评案量刑。工作干部首先报告了案情和量刑标准，然后大家分组讨论。经居民群众讨论结果，原判死刑的十四名未变，判处死刑，缓期二年，强迫劳动，以观后效的五名中有一名改为立即执行；判处徒刑的十名中有二名改判死刑，二名改判死刑缓期二年，一名释放；原拟释放的九名中有一名改判徒刑。这些改变都较原判正确合理。
    河北省杨柳青镇人民政府邀请各界人民代表组成清案委员会，对反革命案犯进行调查研究、审讯、量刑等工作，迅速清理了反革命积案，并在判决中准确地体现了镇压与宽大相结合的政策。十天中，清案委员会共清理了四十七件案件。初步审判结果，计判处死刑的二名，判处死刑缓期二年的二名，其余分别判处徒刑或释放后予以管制。
    上述各地依靠人民群众清理反革命案件，不仅迅速，而且准确，得到了广大人民的拥护和称赞。川北区南充市的人民称赞说：真是杀得准、关得对、放得该、办得快。河北河间、通县两县的人民说：政府把大权交给咱们，咱们必须谨慎，以理公断，不能错放一个，也不能错杀一个。各地参加清案工作的人民代表都非常积极，并且进一步认识了人民民主政权的本质，共同感到人民确实成了国家的主人。就是许多被管制的反革命分子，也老老实实向人民悔过，表示愿在政府的管制和人民的监督下，从劳动中改造自己。
