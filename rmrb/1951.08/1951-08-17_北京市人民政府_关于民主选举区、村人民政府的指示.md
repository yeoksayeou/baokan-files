The Beijing Municipal People's Government
Instructions Regarding the Democratic Election of District and Village People's Governments

The following is the full text of the instructions from the Beijing Municipal People's Government regarding the democratic election of district and village people's governments:

Based on the resolution of the First Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference regarding the eight work guidelines for this year, which stipulates that all district and village people's governments in the city should implement democratic elections, we conducted experiments in the suburbs during the first half of the year and achieved successful experiences.

In this experiment, one district people's government and eighty-five village people's governments were elected. Because we boldly mobilized the masses and relied on the masses during the election, and after the masses fully deliberated and repeatedly discussed, great achievements were made. Many truly good cadres were re-elected, while cadres who were considered bad by the people, such as those who violated the law, neglected their duties, had poor work styles, or were irresponsible, were voted out. Among the village cadres in the eighty-five villages, about one-third were not re-elected, which greatly improved the leadership composition of the village governments. This has made the relationship between the people and the government closer. The work efficiency of the cadres has also significantly improved. Based on the above experience, in order to further build people's democratic power, it is necessary to fully promote democracy and universally elect district and village people's governments. To this end, the Joint Meeting of the Consultative Committee of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference and the Municipal People's Government Committee on August 11 decided to issue the following instructions:

1.  All district and village people's governments in the urban and suburban areas of the city, except those that have already been elected, must complete democratic elections in the second half of this year. The district people's government committees should, based on the specific conditions of each district, elect a district head, deputy district head, and a total of eleven to fifteen members. In districts with a large number of ethnic minorities, ethnic minorities should occupy an appropriate number of seats in the district people's government committee.

    (1) In order to align the terms of office of the representatives of the people from all walks of life in the urban districts with the terms of office of the representatives of the people from all walks of life in the city, so as to facilitate elections and facilitate closer contact and integration between the city and districts in the deployment and conduct of work, the terms of office of the representatives of the First Session of the People's Representatives Conference of all districts in the urban area shall be extended uniformly to the end of 1951. However, if individual representative-producing units need to replace their representatives, they may consult with the district consultative committee to replace them. If necessary, the number of members of the district consultative committee may also be appropriately increased, but the total number shall not exceed nineteen. The Fourth Session of the First People's Representatives Conference of each district in the urban area will be convened in August and will exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress to elect the district people's government.

    (2) The election work of the district and village people's governments in the suburbs should be completed around the autumn harvest.

2.  The key to doing a good job in the election lies in in-depth publicity, boldly mobilizing the masses, and conducting full deliberation. The list of candidates should be proposed by the electors after deliberation and discussion, and should not be monopolized or interfered with. The district head, members of the district people's government, village head, and members of the village people's government who are elected shall be approved by the Municipal People's Government, except for those found to be deprived of political rights. The village head and members of the village people's government shall be approved by the district people's government in charge of the area and reported to the Municipal People's Government for record.

　　北京市人民政府
    关于民主选举区、村人民政府的指示
    北京市人民政府关于民主选举区、村人民政府的指示，全文如下：
    根据北京市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议关于今年八项工作方针中全市的区、村人民政府一律实行民主选举的决议，上半年我们先在郊区做了试验，取得了成功的经验。
    这次试验，选举了一个区人民政府和八十五个村人民政府。由于进行选举时放手发动群众、依靠群众，经过群众充分酝酿与反复讨论，所以收到很大成绩。许多确实好的干部，均连选连任；而人民认为不好的干部，如违法失职，作风不好或工作不负责任的，则被选掉了。八十五个村的村干部，落选的约占总数的三分之一，这就大大地改善了村政权的领导成分。因而使人民和政府的关系更加密切了。干部的工作效率也显著提高了。根据以上经验，为了进一步建设人民民主政权，必须充分发扬民主，普遍选举区、村人民政府，为此，经八月十一日本市第三届各界人民代表会议协商委员会和市人民政府委员会联席会议讨论决定，特作如下指示：
    一、全市城区和郊区的区村人民政府，除已由选举产生者外，今年下半年必须一律完成民主选举，各区人民政府委员会，根据各区具体情况，选举区长、副区长及委员共十一人至十五人组成之。居民中少数民族较多之区，在区人民政府委员会中，少数民族应占适当名额。
    （一）为使城区各区各界人民代表会议代表任期和市各界人民代表会议代表任期一致，以便于进行选举，便于市与区在工作的布置和进行上，更能密切地联系与结合，城区各区第一届各界人民代表会议代表任期一律延长至一九五一年年终，但个别代表产生单位，如需要更换其代表，可与区协商委员会商定更换之。各区协商委员会委员名额，如有必要，亦可适当增加，但总数不得超过十九名。城区各区第一届第四次各界人民代表会议即在八月份内召开，并代行人民代表大会职权，选举区人民政府。
    （二）郊区区、村人民政府选举工作，在秋收前后完成。
    二、做好选举的关键，在于深入宣传，放手发动群众，进行充分酝酿。候选人名单，应由选举人酝酿讨论提出，不得包办或干涉。选出来的区长、区人民政府委员、村长、村人民政府委员，除发现有应剥夺政治权利者外，区长、区人民政府委员，本府即一律予以批准。村长、村人民政府委员，则由该管区人民政府予以批准，并报本府备案。
