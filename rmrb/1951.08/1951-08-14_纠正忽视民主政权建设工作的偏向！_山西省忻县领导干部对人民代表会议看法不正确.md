　　Correct the tendency to neglect the construction of democratic power!
　　Leaders and cadres of Xin County, Shanxi Province, hold incorrect views on People's Representative Conferences
　　Leaders and cadres of Xin County, Shanxi Province, do not attach importance to the construction of democratic power. Cadres at all levels generally hold many incorrect views on People's Representative Conferences, and the People's Representative Conferences have failed to give full play to their role.
　　The county began the construction of democratic power in 1949 and has successively convened four county People's Representative Conferences and fifteen sessions of the Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference, and has generally convened village People's Representative Conferences. This has achieved certain results in strengthening the ties between the people's government and the masses, strengthening the unity of people of all strata, completing production tasks, and educating cadres to change their style of work. However, because the county's leading cadres have not conducted sufficient ideological education for cadres on the work of building political power, and they themselves rarely study documents on building political power, most cadres still do not realize that the People's Representative Conference and the People's Congress are the basic system of our national power. Many cadres do not even know what the People's Representative Conference is. The most common phenomenon is that most villages improperly use village people's representatives, and convene people's representatives to deploy work at every turn. Some people's representatives are blamed by village cadres if they fail to complete their tasks. This erroneous understanding of the nature of people's representatives also exists among some district cadres. For example, when a work team in District One was handling the election of representatives in Beizhao Village, some district cadres said to people: "The responsibilities of a representative are the same as those of a village head." Because cadres generally have these erroneous understandings, they despise the convening of People's Representative Conferences. At each meeting of the Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference, most of those who were absent were cadres in office. When the Fourth People's Representative Conference was held, the head of District One was elected as a representative, but after registering, he did not know where the list of representatives and proposals for District One were, and the lists of representatives and proposals for other districts were also incomplete. As a result, there were only 219 names on the list of 260 representatives in the county. At the Third People's Representative Conference, various county-level agencies submitted lists of cadres to attend the meeting as observers, but none of them attended; by the Fourth People's Representative Conference, the agencies did not even have lists of observers.
　　Because cadres at all levels in the county generally despise the People's Representative Conference, there are the following serious shortcomings in the construction of democratic power:
　　First, some central tasks have not been discussed by the People's Representative Conference. For example, the county's land reform review work is a mass movement to thoroughly eliminate the feudal land system in rural areas, and it is also a good opportunity to educate the masses on the people's democratic dictatorship and mobilize the masses to build their own political power; however, the county's representative conference has neither discussed this major task, nor have most of the work teams taken this into account. In 123 administrative villages, only eight had reports on the work of building democratic power. Therefore, after the land reform review work was completed, the village People's Representative Conference system was simply established.
　　Second, the phenomenon of monopolizing elections is widespread. County and district agencies rarely contact representatives in ordinary times, and do not pay attention to their education and training. The representatives of many villages are designated by the village cadres, or they are formally elected, forming a phenomenon of making up the numbers. For example, Ma Guangtong is a representative of Douhuai Village and Liushi Village in District Six, but the village cadres did not pass through Liushi Village, nor did they decide after an election. The head of the county's education section, fearing that teacher Zhang Chaokang would delay education work if he became a representative, proposed at the Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference that he not be invited as a special representative. Some of the main responsible cadres in the district also hold a simplistic view of poor and lower-middle peasants, believing that poor and lower-middle peasants should account for two-thirds of the representatives to the village People's Representative Conference, while middle peasants can only account for one-third. Because the representatives were not produced through democratic elections, coupled with the dominance of these erroneous ideas, neither the county nor the village People's Representative Conference's representatives and the breadth of their representation have been well-studied. Therefore, the masses do not attach importance to the People's Representative Conference, and the representatives themselves believe that they have been captured to be a "figurehead." Although the county has held four People's Representative Conferences, the relevant departments have rarely analyzed and studied how many representatives can truly play a role.
　　Third, the collection of proposals and the handling of resolutions are not serious enough. For example, when the Fourth County People's Representative Conference was convened, some district cadres did not distribute the proposal forms to the villages. The resolutions of each People's Representative Conference are routinely handed over to various departments for handling, without seriously checking the implementation, forming a phenomenon of hastily checking the resolutions of the previous meeting before the next meeting is convened. Therefore, the county leadership has never grasped the situation of the various departments' implementation of the resolutions. For example, when the county convened the Fourth People's Representative Conference, it did not seriously check the implementation of the matters entrusted to the government by the previous meeting, nor did it explain it to the conference. Although this meeting was held not long ago, most of the cadres in the relevant departments have long forgotten how many resolutions there were.
　　The existence of the above shortcomings has prevented the county's People's Representative Conferences from giving full play to their role. Some people even regard the village cadres as "baojia heads," and the administrative commandism and violations of law and discipline by many village cadres still exist seriously.

### 纠正忽视民主政权建设工作的偏向！  山西省忻县领导干部对人民代表会议看法不正确

　　纠正忽视民主政权建设工作的偏向！
    山西省忻县领导干部对人民代表会议看法不正确
    山西省忻县领导干部不重视民主政权的建设工作，各级干部普遍存在着对人民代表会议的许多不正确的看法，人民代表会议未能充分发挥作用。
    该县自一九四九年就开始了民主政权的建设工作，已先后召开了四次县各界人民代表会议和十五次各界人民代表会议常务委员会，普遍召开了村人民代表会议。这对于密切人民政府和群众的联系，加强各阶层人民的团结，完成生产任务，以及教育干部转变作风等方面是获得一定成绩的。但因该县领导干部对建政工作，未向干部进行充分的思想教育，自己对建政的文件亦很少学习，大部分干部至今没有认识到，人民代表会议和人民代表大会是我们国家政权的基本制度。许多干部甚至还不知道各界人民代表会议是什么机关。最普遍的现象是大部分村庄不恰当地使用村人民代表，动辄召集人民代表开会布置工作，有些人民代表没有完成任务时，就要受到村干部的责备。这种对人民代表的性质的错误认识，同样存在于某些区干部中。如一区工作组在北赵村办理代表选举工作时，有些区干部对人说：“代表的责任和闾长一样。”由于干部中间普遍有这些错误的认识，他们便轻视各界人民代表会议的召开。每次各界人民代表会议常务委员会开会，缺席的多数是在职的干部代表。在举行第四次各界人民代表会议时，一区区长当选代表，但他在报到以后，还不知道一区的代表名单和提案在什么地方，其他区的代表名单和提案也是残缺不全。结果全县二百六十名代表只有二百一十九名的名单。在第三次各界人民代表会议时，县级各机关送交了列席会议的干部名单，但都没有出席；到第四次各界人民代表会议时，各机关连列席的名单也没有了。
    因为该县各级干部普遍轻视人民代表会议，在民主政权的建设上就存在着以下几个严重缺点：
    第一、有些中心工作没有经过人民代表会议的讨论。如该县的土地改革复查工作，是一个在农村中彻底消灭封建土地制度的群众运动，也是向群众进行人民民主专政教育和发动群众建设自己的政权的好机会；但该县代表会既未讨论过这一重大任务，大部分工作组也都忽略了这一点，在一百二十三个行政村中，只有八个有过民主政权建设工作的报告。因此，在土地改革复查工作结束后，又单纯地去建立村人民代表会议制度。
    第二、包办选举的现象普遍存在，县、区各机关平常也很少和代表联系，不注意对他们的教育和培养。许多村庄的代表是村干部指定的，或者形式地选举一下，形成凑数的现象。如马光同是六区的豆槐村和六石村的代表，但是村干部没有通过六石村，也没有经选举就决定了。该县教育科长怕教员张超康当了代表耽误教育工作，就在各界人民代表会议常务委员会上，提出不请他当特邀代表。有些区的主要负责干部还有单纯的贫雇农观点，认为村人民代表会议的代表，贫雇农应占三分之二，中农只能占三分之一。由于代表的产生没有经过民主选举，再加上这些错误思想的支配，无论是县、村人民代表会议的代表情况和其代表的广泛性，都没有很好地研究过。因此，群众也就不重视人民代表会议，代表本人也认为是人家捉他的“大头”。虽然该县已开过四次各界人民代表会议，但究竟有多少代表真正能起作用，有关部门很少作过分析研究。
    第三、对于提案的收集和决议的处理不够认真。如召开第四次县各界人民代表会议时，有的区干部没有把提案纸发到各村。每次各界人民代表会议的决议照例地交各部门办理，而不认真检查执行情况，形成下次会议召开前才草率地检查上次会议决议的现象，因而各部门执行决议案的情况如何，县的领导上始终没有掌握。如该县召集第四次各界人民代表会议时，就没有认真检查上次会议交政府办理事项的执行情形，也没向大会作交代。这次会议虽然刚开过不久，但决议案究竟有几条，有关部门的大部分干部早忘记了。
    以上缺点的存在，使该县各界人民代表会议未能充分发挥作用，有的群众甚至还把村干部当做“保甲长”，不少村干部的行政命令作风和违法乱纪的事情仍然严重存在。
