　　(I) Another Test of the U.S. Government's Sincerity for Peace
    On August 6th, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted a resolution in response to the letter from the U.S. Congress to the Soviet people in June of this year. In the resolution, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR once again suggested that the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers – the United States, Britain, China, France, and the Soviet Union – is the most important step in maintaining international peace and security. This once again demonstrates the unwavering efforts of the Soviet government for world peace and friendship among all nations.
    The U.S. Congress's letter to the Soviet people was issued against the background of a widespread increase in the American people's desire for peace. The American people have seen the Truman administration's policy of aggressive war increasingly adding to their poverty and suffering, and leading them deeper and deeper into the abyss of disaster. They demanded an end to this evil policy and called for improving the current tense international relations, especially improving the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. Even some within the American bourgeoisie, along with the continuous failures of the Truman administration's aggressive war policy worldwide and the serious consequences it has incurred, have become dissatisfied and doubtful. It was under these circumstances that the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives passed a joint resolution in June (i.e., the letter to the Soviet people), on the one hand blaming the current tense international situation on the fabricated so-called "barriers" created by the Soviet Union; on the other hand, declaring that the United States is willing to resolve the differences between the United States and the Soviet Union and is willing to promote world peace.
    In its resolution, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet refuted the absurdity of the so-called Soviet "artificial barriers." The resolution pointed out: "Soviet foreign policy has not imposed any obstacles to harmony between the Soviet people and the American people and the peoples of other countries, nor has it imposed any obstacles to establishing commercial, trade, and friendly relations with these countries." The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet also listed many convincing facts to prove that it is not the Soviet Union but the U.S. government that has erected artificial barriers between the United States and the Soviet Union, placing U.S.-Soviet relations in an abnormal state.
    The U.S. Congress's resolution declared that the United States is willing to resolve U.S.-Soviet differences and promote world peace, but what the U.S. government has done since the end of World War II, and what it is doing now, is completely contrary to what the resolution declares. In fact, for the past six years, the U.S. government has pursued not a policy of peace but a policy of war, not strengthening friendly relations between countries but creating mutual hostility, not maintaining world peace but undermining world peace. The U.S. government authorities are attempting to conquer the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democracies by force in order to achieve their aggressive aim of enslaving all the people of the world. To this end, the U.S. government has implemented a massive military buildup at home, putting the United States on a war footing; in the West, it has organized the aggressive North Atlantic military alliance, rearming West Germany, and recently intensified its efforts to organize a European aggressive army, even planning to include the fascist Franco government in the North Atlantic bloc; in the East, it has launched an aggressive war in Korea, invaded our country's Taiwan, supported the Kuomintang bandit gang, rearmed Japan, and established a network of military bases around our country. The heads of the U.S. government, many members of Congress, and the bourgeois press have done their utmost to slander and defame the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, create an atmosphere of war, and drive the American people and the countries subservient to the United States to serve its aggressive war policy. These measures by the U.S. government constitute a serious threat to world peace and are the root cause of the current international tension. From these facts, one cannot help but conclude that the U.S. authorities' verbal statements are contrary to their actual actions.
    Despite the fact that the U.S. authorities have pursued a policy of aggressive war in the past and are doing so now, the Soviet government still made a sincere reply since the U.S. Congress expressed its desire for peace. It is well known that the Soviet government has consistently pursued the Leninist-Stalinist policy of peace and has been committed to the cause of maintaining world peace since its founding. At various international conferences after the war, the Soviet government repeatedly put forward proposals to eliminate the danger of war, promote friendly relations between countries, and maintain world peace, and has waged an unyielding struggle to defend the cause of world peace. In its resolution of August 6, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet welcomed the U.S. Congress's statement in its letter to the Soviet people regarding efforts to improve U.S.-Soviet relations and strengthen peace, and considered that "a more important step in improving U.S.-Soviet relations and strengthening peace among all nations is the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, which other countries committed to strengthening peace can also join."
    The Soviet Union's proposal for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact will undoubtedly be supported by all peace-loving people around the world. The 475 million people of the People's Republic of China warmly support the Soviet proposal. The people of our country have consistently supported the signing of a peace pact by the five major powers, and more than 343 million people in our country have signed in support of concluding a peace pact by the five major powers. The five major powers of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France occupy a pivotal position in the world. If the five major powers are determined to maintain peace, peace can be consolidated. In the past two years, the Soviet Union has twice proposed the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, once on September 23, 1949, at the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and again on September 20, 1950, at the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, but both times it was rejected by the hypocritical "majority" group headed by the United States. The United Nations, due to being forcibly controlled by U.S. imperialism, due to disregarding the interests and will of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the countries of Asia, which together account for more than half of humanity, and due to unreasonably refusing the participation of the People's Republic of China, has repeatedly proven that it is not an instrument of peace. Today, only a peace pact of the five major powers can definitively guarantee human peace, and anyone who insists on opposing the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers can only be someone who wants war. This is as clear as the sun at noon. Since U.S. President Truman and the U.S. Congress have declared their willingness to strengthen international peace, then they should accept the Soviet proposal, they should agree to the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, and agree to disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the establishment of international control. If the U.S. government rejects these proposals, then it proves that the U.S. authorities only want peace in words but war in reality. This is a real test of the U.S. government's peace rhetoric.

### （一）美国政府和平诚意的又一次考验

　　（一）美国政府和平诚意的又一次考验
    八月六日，苏联最高苏维埃主席团通过了一项决议，作为对美国国会今年六月间致苏联人民书的答复。苏联最高苏维埃主席团在决议案中再度建议：美、英、中、法、苏五大国缔结和平公约，是维护国际和平与安全的最重要的步骤。这再一次表明，苏联政府坚定不渝地为世界和平与各国间的友好而努力。
    美国国会致苏联人民书是在美国人民要求和平的情绪普遍增长的情况下发出的。美国人民眼看见杜鲁门政府的侵略战争政策日益加重他们的贫困和痛苦，日益把他们引进灾难的深渊。他们要求结束这种罪恶政策，要求改善目前紧张的国际关系，特别要求改善美国对苏联的关系。甚至美国资产阶级中的一部分人，也随着杜鲁门政府的侵略战争政策在世界范围内不断的失败并招致严重的恶果，发生不满和怀疑。就是在这样的情况下，美国参院和众院在六月间通过联合决议（即致苏联人民书），一方面将目前紧张的国际局势归咎于虚构的所谓苏联所造成的“障壁”；另一方面又扬言美国愿意解决美苏间的分歧，愿意促进世界和平。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团在决议中驳斥了所谓苏联“人工障壁”的无稽。决议指出：“苏联外交政策对于苏联人民和美国人民以及其他各国人民的和睦方面，并没有加以任何阻碍，并且对于在和这些国家建立商务、贸易与友好关系方面，也没有加以任何阻碍。”苏联最高苏维埃主席团并列举令人信服的许多事实，证明在美苏间树立人为障壁、使美苏关系处于不正常状态的，不是苏联而是美国政府。
    美国国会的决议声言美国愿意解决美苏分歧和促进世界和平，但是美国政府在第二次世界大战结束以来的所作所为，以及它现在的所作所为，完全与决议所声言的相反。事实上，六年来美国政府所奉行的不是和平政策而是战争政策，不是加强各国友好关系而是制造各国互相仇视，不是维护世界和平而是破坏世界和平。美国政府当局企图用武力征服苏联、中国以及各人民民主国家，以遂其奴役全世界人民的侵略目的。为此，美国政府在国内实行庞大的军备计划，把美国导入战争轨道上去；在西方组织侵略性的北大西洋军事联盟，重新武装西德，最近更变本加厉地组织欧洲侵略军，甚至策划把法西斯佛朗哥政府也网罗在北大西洋集团中；在东方发动侵略朝鲜战争，侵略我国台湾，支持国民党匪帮，重新武装日本，并在邻近我国周围建立军事基地网。美国政府首脑、许多国会议员以及资产阶级报纸，对以苏联为首的和平民主阵营极尽污蔑、诽谤之能事，制造战争空气，驱使美国人民以及美国仆从国家为其侵略战争政策服务。美国政府的这些措施，构成了对世界和平的严重威胁，也是目前国际间紧张局势的根源。从这些事实看来，人们不能不认为美国当局口头上的声明和它的实际行动是相反的。
    尽管美国当局过去和现在都执行侵略战争的政策，但美国国会既然表示了和平的愿望，苏联政府就仍然作了恳切的答复。人们都知道，苏联政府一贯奉行列宁斯大林的和平政策，从立国到现在一直致力于维护世界和平的事业。在战后历次国际会议上，苏联政府再三提出消弭战争危险、促进各国友好关系、维护世界和平的建议，并为保卫世界和平事业而进行不折不挠的斗争。苏联最高苏维埃主席团在八月六日的决议中，欢迎美国国会在致苏联人民书中关于设法改善美苏关系和加强和平的声言，并认为在改善美苏关系及加强各国人民间的和平方面，“更为重要的步骤是五大国缔结和平公约，其他致力于加强和平的国家也可以参加”。
    苏联的这一五大国缔结和平公约的建议，无疑获得全世界爱好和平人民的支持。中华人民共和国的四亿七千五百万人民，热烈拥护苏联的建议。我国人民一贯赞同五大国签订和平公约，我国已有三亿四千三百余万人签名拥护缔结五大国和平公约。中苏英美法五大国在世界上占有举足轻重的地位，五大国决心维护和平，和平就能够巩固。在过去两年中，苏联曾两度提出五大国缔结和平公约的建议，一次是一九四九年九月二十三日在第四届联合国大会上，另一次是在一九五○年九月二十日第五届联合国大会上，但两次都被以美国为首的虚伪的“多数”集团拒绝了。联合国由于被美帝国主义强横地控制着，由于漠视苏联、东欧和亚洲的共占人类半数以上的各国人民的利益和意志，并且无理地拒绝中华人民共和国的参加，已经再三证明它不是和平的工具。在今天，只有五大国的和平公约才能确定地保障人类的和平，而任何坚持反对在五大国之间缔结和平公约的人就只能是要求战争的人，这已是和白天的太阳一样地明显了。美国总统杜鲁门和美国国会既然声言愿意加强国际和平，那末他们就应该接受苏联的建议，就应该赞同五大国缔结和平公约，赞同裁减军备、禁止原子武器并建立国际管制。如果美国政府拒绝这些建议，那就证明美国当局只是口头上要和平，实际上要战争。这是对美国政府和平言词的真正考验。
