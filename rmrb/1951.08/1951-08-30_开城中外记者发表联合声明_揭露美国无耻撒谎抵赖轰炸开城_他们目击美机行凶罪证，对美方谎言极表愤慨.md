Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 29th: The Dagong Bao reporter Zhu Qiping, the French Ce Soir reporter Béchade, and the British Daily Worker reporter Alan Winnington, who are in Kaesong covering the news of the Korean armistice talks, issued a joint statement on the 28th, exposing the shameless lies issued by the American side regarding the American aircraft bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone on August 22nd. The full text of the statement is as follows:

We, the undersigned reporters from Shanghai, Chongqing and Hong Kong Dagong Bao, London Daily Worker, and Paris Ce Soir, are extremely indignant at the outrageous lies told by the United States regarding the Kaesong bombing incident on August 22nd, and therefore issue the following joint statement:

We were less than two hundred yards from where the bombs fell. We were within a few feet of Colonel Kenney and Colonel Murray when they conducted their so-called "investigation." The notes taken at the time are still in our hands. We can absolutely prove that the official factual report issued by the Korean and Chinese side is true, and we are determined to expose the extremely casual attitude of the American side towards this entire incident, as well as their reckless insults. Merely repeating their words cannot express their unbearable attitude towards the Korean and Chinese side, nor can it express the extreme patience of the Korean and Chinese side.

Approximately three hours after the bombing, Kenney arrived in Kaesong. The Korean and Chinese side told him that aircraft had bombed the conference area and shrapnel had hit General Nam Il's jeep, and that the aircraft later strafed the delegation's residence with machine guns. Kenney immediately began to ask many questions in a very hostile manner. "What were the results of the bombing? How many aircraft were there? Who saw the aircraft? Are there any witnesses?" Colonel Zhang Chunshan replied, "You will see clearly when the investigation is conducted. Everyone here (referring to approximately thirty journalists and delegation members) saw it with their own eyes." Kenney instructed his assistant to note: no one knows how many aircraft or how many bombs there were. Then everyone left in jeeps. About ninety yards from the uninhabited United Nations residence, there was a shallow crater with a ruptured gasoline bomb casing next to it. There was also solidified gasoline splashed around. Colonel Zhang Chunshan said, "What is this?" Kenney mockingly said, "That's a bomb? It could very well be something else." He did not pick it up to look at it. He refused to approach it or look at the crater, and just said, "I've seen enough. I've dropped many bombs myself. That's nothing." He called his translator and said to him, "Tell them. Tell them. If this is what they want to show us, I'm impatient – very impatient." The above occurred within minutes of the start of the investigation. Then we walked about two hundred yards along the hillside from the delegation headquarters. At that time, only six craters were found in the dark. Upon reaching the place where the tail of the bomb was first seen buried in the mud, Kenney immediately said without even approaching it, "That's not a bomb, nor is it anything from a bomb." Colonel Zhang Chunshan asked, "If it's not a bomb, what is it? How did it get there?" Kenney said, "You should know more about it than I do." Then he turned his face and said in an extremely sarcastic and rude tone to the people standing next to him (most of whom had relatives killed by American bombs), "Has anyone here seen the scene after the American aircraft bombed?" No one answered. Ten steps away from us, near a rock embedded with shrapnel, we saw another crater. Kenney refused to approach it to investigate, and just said, "There's nothing there. Let's go back, Jim." (This was said to Colonel Murray). Murray murmured, "We'd better take a look." We approached the second crater, and Kenney fell behind. He was asked to come closer and take a look, but he said, "No! I've seen enough." Colonel Zhang Chunshan said, "We request that you continue this investigation." Kenney shouted, "You what? Who gives you the right to request? You have no right to request anything." While Murray was looking, Kenney kept saying, "Okay, Jim, let's go back." There were three more craters and bomb tails nearby, but Kenney refused to look.

Back at the conference location, Colonel Zhang lodged the strongest verbal protest and said, "Tomorrow's meeting is cancelled." Kenney asked "What meeting?" Colonel Zhang replied, "All meetings" (meaning the liaison officer meeting and the subcommittee meeting scheduled for August 23rd). Kenney said, "I will convey your ridiculous protest," and left.

At this time, some more gasoline bombs were found, and the Korean and Chinese liaison officers chased after the American personnel. The American personnel returned after raising many objections about the rain and darkness. At this time, the photographers and some journalists, thinking that the investigation would no longer continue, had already returned. Kenney was obviously relieved when handling the second gasoline bomb (identical to the first) because no one was taking pictures. There was a bad smell at the sites of the burned solidified gasoline, the burned grass, and the unburned solidified gasoline. Kenney turned over a bent piece of metal and said, "It has flat rivets on it – not our stuff." We then met the Chinese soldier performing police duties. He saw the aircraft, and saw and heard the gasoline bombs fall. Kenney began to quickly interrogate him: "Did you see the aircraft?" The soldier gestured with his hand and said, "I saw it. It came from this direction." Kenney asked, "How many engines?" The soldier replied, "I couldn't see, but I saw two lights." Kenney asked, "Were the lights on the aircraft on before or after the bombing?" The soldier replied, "I saw the lights before the bombing." Kenney turned to his assistant and told him to note: "A soldier said he saw the aircraft turn on its lights before bombing." At this point, Ce Soir reporter Béchade interjected and said, "Colonel, the soldier said he saw two lights, not that he saw the aircraft turn on its lights. It could have been the aircraft's exhaust, or it could have been the bomb bay." Kenney said, "Sir, I'm not talking to you. Don't interfere." Then he turned his back to the soldier and stopped questioning the only witness he had spoken to, and then walked away arrogantly. Béchade followed him and said, "Colonel, this is a deliberate distortion. The soldier said he saw two lights, not that he saw the lights turned on." Kenney said, "Shut up, or I'll order you to leave this place. You have no right to be here." Béchade said, "As a journalist, I have every right to be here, and I am a witness to the bombing." Kenney called Colonel Zhang and shone a flashlight on Béchade, saying, "Colonel, you want this person to leave this place. This person I'm shining the flashlight on." When Colonel Zhang asked Béchade if he had committed any illegal acts, Kenney demanded that all reporters leave immediately. He said, "I've told you before, it's impossible to conduct an investigation when there are reporters present." When Colonel Zhang asked him what he was really opposed to, Kenney strode away, saying, "I'm going back. I'll bring our own reporters back tomorrow." At this time, Murray was examining some unburned solidified gasoline that was still gelatinous. Kenney called him back and again demanded that the investigation be conducted when American reporters could be present. Both sides agreed: in order to continue the investigation, the reporters had to leave this place, and Kenney finally agreed to continue the investigation. Our eyewitness account ends here. We later learned that Kenney saw another piece of evidence, and then refused to continue the investigation because it was too dark, and both sides agreed to bring American reporters the next day. We heard that the agreed-upon method was that Kenney would call to say when he would come. But he has not called until today.

In his report, Kenney said that there was no evidence of solidified gasoline bomb shrapnel, that the bomb tail was "something from an American aircraft or a rocket tail," that Colonel Zhang demanded that all negotiations be stopped "from now on," and that Colonel Zhang refused to conduct any further investigation, in addition to other minor lies. Signatories to this statement: Zhu Qiping, former war correspondent with the US military in the Pacific region, Dagong Bao reporter; Béchade, former war correspondent with the US military in the Pacific region, Ce Soir reporter; Alan Winnington, former London air raid monitor, Daily Worker correspondent in China, military reporter in Korea (signed)

　　开城中外记者发表联合声明
    揭露美国无耻撒谎抵赖轰炸开城
    他们目击美机行凶罪证，对美方谎言极表愤慨
    【新华社开城二十九日电】在开城采访朝鲜停战谈判会议新闻的大公报记者朱启平、法国今晚报记者贝却敌、英国工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿，于二十八日发表联合声明，揭露美国方面关于美国飞机八月二十二日轰炸开城中立区事件所发出的无耻谎言。声明全文如下：
    我们在这里签名的上海、重庆与香港大公报记者，伦敦工人日报记者和巴黎今晚报记者对于美国关于八月二十二日轰炸开城事件所撒的弥天大谎极为愤慨，因此特发表联合声明如下：
    我们离炸弹落下的地方不到两百码远。当肯尼上校和穆莱上校进行所谓“调查”的时候，我们离他们不到几英尺远。当时记下的笔记还在我们手中。我们绝对可以证明朝中方面发表的正式事实报告是确实的，我们决心揭露美方对待这整个事件的极端轻率的态度，以及他们放肆的侮辱行为。仅仅把他们的话重述出来，还不能够表达出他们对待朝中方面的令人不能忍受的态度，也不能够表达出朝中方面的极度忍耐。
    飞机投弹后约三小时，肯尼到达开城，朝中方面告诉他说：有飞机轰炸会议区，弹片落在南日将军的吉普车上，后来飞机又用机枪扫射代表住宅。肯尼立即开始以非常敌意的态度反问许多问题。“轰炸的结果怎么样？有多少架飞机？有谁看见飞机？有人证没有？”张春山上校回答说：“进行调查的时候你就会清楚了。这里的每一个人（指约三十个新闻记者和代表团人员）都亲眼看见的。”肯尼指示他的助手记下：没有人知道有多少架飞机或多少个炸弹。于是大家坐了吉普车离开。在距离没有人居住的联合国寓所约九十码的地方，有一个浅弹坑，旁边有一个破裂的汽油弹弹壳。周围还溅有凝固汽油。张春山上校说：“这是什么？”肯尼嘲弄着说：“那是炸弹？那很可能是别的什么东西。”他并没有把那个东西拿起来看。他拒绝走近去，也不肯看看那个弹坑，他只是说：“我看够了。我亲自投过许多炸弹。那算不了什么。”他把他的翻译官叫来，向他说：“告诉他们。告诉他们。如果这就是他们要指给我们看的东西，我真不耐烦了——很不耐烦。”以上这些是发生在开始调查后几分钟之内的事。然后我们从代表团总部沿山坡走了约两百码。那时候在黑夜里只发现了六个弹坑。到达第一次见到炸弹弹尾埋在泥中的地方，肯尼还没有走近去马上就说：“那不是炸弹，也不是炸弹上的任何东西。”张春山上校问：“不是炸弹是什么？它怎么会跑到那里去？”肯尼说：“你应该比我更知道一些。”随着他转过脸去用极为讥刺和粗暴的口吻向站在旁边的人（这些人中大半都有亲属被美国炸弹杀害的）说：“这里有没有人看见过美机轰炸后的情形？”没有人回答。离开我们十步远的地方，在一块上面嵌着弹片的岩石附近，我们又看见一个弹坑；肯尼不肯跑近去察看，只是说：“什么东西都没有。让我们回去吧，吉姆。”（这是对穆莱上校说的）。穆莱喃喃地说：“我们最好看看。”我们走近第二个弹坑，肯尼掉在后面。人家请他跑近些看看，可是他说：“不！我看够了。”张春山上校说：“我们要求你继续进行这个调查。”肯尼大声叫道：“你什么？谁给你要求的权利？你没有权利要求任何事情。”当穆莱看着的时候，肯尼不断地说：“好了，吉姆，让我们回去吧。”在附近还有三个弹坑和炸弹弹尾，肯尼不肯看。
    回到会议地点，张上校提出了最强硬的口头抗议，并且说：“明天的会议取消了。”肯尼问“什么会议”，张上校答道：“一切会议”（意思是说联络官会议以及定于八月二十三日召开的小组委员会会议）。肯尼说：“我将转达你的荒谬可笑的抗议”，便走了。
    在这时候，又发现了一些汽油弹，朝鲜和中国的联络官便追上美方人员，美方人员在关于下雨和天黑提出了许多次的反对意见之后回来了。这个时候，摄影记者和一些新闻记者以为调查不再继续进行，已经回去了。肯尼在处理第二个汽油弹（与第一个相同）时，因为没有人摄照片，显然感到放心。燃烧过的凝固汽油，燃烧过的草地，以及没有燃烧的凝固汽油的地点都有臭味。肯尼把一件弯曲的金属片翻过来说，“上头有平铆钉——不是我们的东西”。我们接着会见了执行警察职务的中国兵士。他看到了飞机，看见了并且听到了汽油弹落下来。肯尼开始迅速盘问：“你看见飞机吗？”兵士用手比划说：“看见的。它从这个方向飞来。”肯尼问：“几个引擎？”士兵答道：“我看不见，但我看见两道光。”肯尼问：“飞机上的光是在投弹以前还是以后亮的？”士兵答道：“我在投弹以前看见光。”肯尼就转向助手，叫他记下：“一个兵士说，他看见飞机在投弹以前开灯。”这时，今晚报记者贝却敌插进来说：“上校，这个士兵是说他看见两道光，不是说他看见飞机把灯开亮。那可能是飞机排的气，也可能是炸弹舱。”肯尼说：“老兄，我不是和你说话。你别管这件事。”接着，他就扭转身，背向士兵，不再询问这个他曾经谈过话的唯一的一个见证人，跟着就傲然走开了。贝却敌跟着走过去说：“上校，这是故意歪曲。那个士兵是说他看见两道光，而不是说看见把灯开亮”。肯尼说：“你住嘴，不然我就命令你离开这个地方。你没有权利在这里。”贝却敌说：“作为一个记者，我完全有权利在这里，而且我是轰炸的见证人。”肯尼招呼张上校，并用手电筒照着贝却敌说：“上校，你要这个人离开这个地方。我用手电筒照着的这个人。”当张上校询问贝却敌是否犯有任何违法行为时，肯尼要求全体记者马上走开。他说：“我以前已对你说过，当跟前有记者的时候，进行调查是不可能的。”当张上校询问他真正反对的是什么事情的时候，肯尼却高视阔步地走开，他说：“我要回去了。我明天带我们自己的记者回来。”这时，穆莱在查看一些仍然是胶状的未燃烧的凝固汽油。肯尼叫他回来，并再度要求到美国记者能够在场时再进行调查。双方同意：为了继续进行调查，要记者离开这个地方，肯尼终于同意继续进行调查。我们亲眼看到的情况的叙述就到此为止。我们稍后得知，肯尼又看到一件证据，后来就拒绝继续进行调查，因为天太黑，双方同意第二天带美国记者来。我们听说，双方协议的办法是，肯尼将打电话来说明他在什么时候来。但直到今天他一直没有来电话。
    肯尼在他的报告中说，没有凝固汽油弹弹片的证据，弹尾是“美国飞机上的东西或火箭弹尾”，说张上校要求“从现在起”停止一切谈判，又说张上校拒绝再进行调查，此外还说了其他一些次要的谎话。本声明签名人：前太平洋地区美军随军记者、大公报记者朱启平，前太平洋地区美军随军记者、今晚报记者贝却敌，前伦敦空袭监视队员、工人日报驻中国记者、驻朝鲜军事记者阿兰·魏宁顿（签字）
