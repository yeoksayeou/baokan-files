　　The Gannan Southwestern People's Paper Mill successfully completed the experiment of using bamboo pulp instead of wood pulp for machine-made paper after more than a year of efforts by all its employees. Bamboo pulp was originally one of China's papermaking raw materials, but it has always only been used for the handicraft production of native paper. Better quality machine-made paper mostly required wood pulp or a combination of wood pulp. Now, the factory can use 100% bamboo pulp to produce newsprint, writing paper, and various high-quality papers. After testing, the color and tensile strength of the paper made from this bamboo pulp meet the standards and are not inferior to paper made from wood pulp. The factory's achievement has been commended by the Central South Region and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, and has attracted attention from various places. At the Native Products Exhibition held in Shanghai, many paper mills in Shanghai have signed contracts with Jiangxi and other places to purchase large quantities of bamboo pulp.

　　The success of the factory in making paper from bamboo pulp provides new experience for China's papermaking industry and opens up infinitely broad prospects. In the past, the raw materials for China's machine-made paper mostly depended on imported wood pulp. After the imperialists imposed an "economic blockade" on our country, wood pulp became difficult to obtain. Self-made grass pulp and reed pulp are too expensive. The biggest advantage of bamboo pulp is that it is easy to cultivate bamboo branches. It can be used after one or two years, unlike wood, which needs to be cultivated for thirty or forty years before it can be pulped. China's bamboo production ranks first in the world, and the producing areas are widely distributed. The potential output of bamboo pulp is very large and inexhaustible. This achievement in papermaking industrial raw materials is a powerful counterattack against the imperialist "blockade."

　　The success of the factory in making paper from bamboo pulp has also solved the sales problem for the main sideline products of more than 40,000 farmers in southern Jiangxi. The mountainous areas of southern Jiangxi are rich in bamboo, and making bamboo pulp is the main sideline production of farmers. According to preliminary investigations, the annual output of bamboo pulp in southern Jiangxi is 12,000 tons. In Shangyou County alone, 15,000 people depend on making bamboo pulp for a living. This situation also shows that the restoration and development of industrial production creates preconditions for the development of agricultural production.

　　Today, when wood is relatively scarce, the successful use of bamboo pulp instead of wood pulp by the Gannan Southwestern People's Paper Mill is a model in industrial raw material research and creation, and its significance is significant.

　　赣西南人民造纸厂用竹浆代替木浆成功
    可节约大量木材并为数万农民的副业生产解决了销路问题
    赣西南人民造纸厂全体职工经过一年多的努力，成功地完成了以竹浆代替木浆用于机器造纸的实验。竹浆本来也是我国造纸原料之一，但历来只用于手工业制造土纸，质料较好的机器造纸大都需用木浆或搭配木浆。现在该厂已能用百分之百的竹浆制成新闻纸、道林纸以及各种上等质料的纸了。经检验，这种竹浆制成的纸色泽与拉力都合规格，并不亚于木浆制成的纸。该厂这一成就，得到了中南区和江西省人民政府的嘉许，并且引起了各地的重视。在上海市举行的土产展览会中，上海许多造纸厂已与江西等地签订了购买大量竹浆的合同。
    该厂竹浆造纸的成功，给新中国造纸工业提供了新的经验，开辟了无限广阔的前途。过去我国机器造纸原料，大部依赖国外进口的木浆。自帝国主义对我国实行“经济封锁”后，木浆一度发生困难。自制草浆、苇浆等成本太高。竹浆的最大优点是培植竹枝容易。一、二年后就能采用，不像木材培植后需经三、四十年才能制浆。我国产竹数量居世界第一，产区分布极广，竹浆的潜在产量很大，是取之不尽用之不竭的。造纸工业原料上的这一成就，是对帝国主义的“封锁”的一个有力的回击。
    该厂竹浆造纸的成功，同时给赣南四万余农民的主要副业生产品解决了销路问题。赣南山地盛产竹类，制造竹浆是农民主要副业生产。据初步调查，赣南竹浆年产量达一万二千吨，仅上犹一县依制竹浆为生者就有一万五千人。这一情况同时说明工业生产的恢复与发展，给农业生产的发展创造了前提条件。
    在木材比较缺乏的今天，赣西南人民造纸厂以竹浆代替木浆成功，是工业原料研究创造方面的一个范例，它的意义是重大的。
