　　The People Respect the Mother of Revolutionary Martyrs
    In the glorious city of Nanchang lives a mother who is respected by the people. She is Mother Fang, the mother of the martyr Fang Zhimin, one of the founders of the old revolutionary base areas and the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. After the Central People's Government Southern Old Revolutionary Base Area Visiting Group arrived in Nanchang, head of the group Xie Juezai, deputy heads Zheng Shaowen and Li Buxin, deputy secretary-general Yan Baohang, and others, accompanied by Shao Shiping, chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, Fang Zhichun, vice chairman, and Yang Shangkui, deputy secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, visited her on the 12th of this month. Group leader Xie personally hung a commemorative medal bearing Chairman Mao's portrait on her.
    Mother Fang did not originally live here. After liberation, Comrade Chen Zhengren, secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Shao Shiping, chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, brought her from her hometown of Yiyang to Nanchang. People respect Mother Fang as they would their own mother. Fang, the division commander of a certain division of the People's Liberation Army, went to the Yiyang area in the summer of 1949 and invited Mother Fang to the division headquarters for meals and theatrical performances after liberation. Division Commander Fang said to her: "My surname is also Fang, you are my mother."
    During the years of cruel persecution by the Kuomintang bandit gangs before liberation, the people always respected and cared for Mother Fang. During the counter-"encirclement and suppression" campaigns and after the main force of the Red Army went north to resist Japan, Mother Fang and other people from the old revolutionary base areas moved to the deep mountains. After the Red Army and the Red Guerrillas seized grain in combat, they would definitely distribute a portion to them. Later, after they came down from the mountains, the Red Guerrillas continued to provide for them. The Kuomintang bandit gangs kept a very close watch on Mother Fang, but the enemy could not ultimately sever the close ties between the masses and Mother Fang. The people of the old revolutionary base area devised various ways to help Mother Fang. One of her nephews, Xu Zhuwang, sent seven loads of grain to Mother Fang through a barber. Mother Fang's house was burned down thirteen times by the bandit gangs, and each time it was rebuilt with the help of the masses. In this way, the people and Mother Fang persevered together until liberation.
    After arriving in Nanchang, Mother Fang continued to live a simple and frugal life. She grows some chili peppers, pumpkins and other vegetables herself, and also raises a few hens. Mother Fang is illiterate, but she is very concerned about national affairs and often asks people to read the newspaper to her. After the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, she became even more concerned about the development of the war situation. She said: "We must not allow the imperialists to invade us again."
    When Group Leader Xie Juezai visited her, he greeted her and wished her good health. Mother Fang also expressed her desire to go to Beijing to see her beloved leader, Chairman Mao. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　人民尊敬革命烈士的母亲
    新华社记者  沈琮
    在光辉的南昌城里住着一位被人民所尊敬的母亲，她是中国老革命根据地和中国工农红军的创建者之一——方志敏烈士的母亲方老太太。中央人民政府南方老根据地访问团到达南昌后，谢觉哉团长、郑绍文、李步新副团长、阎宝航副秘书长等，偕同江西省人民政府邵式平主席、方志纯副主席和中共江西省委副书记杨尚奎等于本月十二日前去访问了她。谢团长亲手替她挂上了镌有毛主席肖像的纪念章。
    方老太太原来是不住在这里的。在解放以后，中共江西省委书记陈正人同志和江西省人民政府邵式平主席把她从弋阳的故乡接来南昌。人们像尊敬自己的母亲一样尊敬方老太太。人民解放军某师的方师长，在一九四九年夏进军赣东北解放了弋阳地区之后，就去接方老太太到师部来吃饭看戏。方师长对她说：“我也姓方，你就是我的母亲。”
    在解放前被国民党匪帮残酷迫害的岁月里，人民始终尊敬和爱护着方老太太。反“围剿”中和红军主力北上抗日以后，方老太太和其他老根据地人民转移到深山中。红军和红色游击队在作战中缴获了粮食之后，必定分一部分给他们。以后他们下了山，红色游击队还不断去接济他们。国民党匪帮对方老太太监视非常严密，但是敌人终究无法隔绝人民群众和方老太太的紧密联系。老根据地人民想出种种方法接济方老太太。她的一位外甥许祝旺就通过一个理发匠给方老太太前后送去七担谷。方老太太的住房被匪帮烧毁了十三次，每次被烧毁后，都在群众帮助下重建起来。就这样，人民和方老太太一起坚持到解放。
    方老太太到南昌以后，依然过着朴素节俭的生活。她自己种着一点辣椒、南瓜等蔬菜，还喂着几只母鸡。方老太太不识字，可是她非常关心国家大事，时常请人家读报。在美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以后，她更是关心着战局的发展。她说：“可不能再让帝国主义来侵略我们。”
    谢觉哉团长去访问她的时候，一见面就祝颂她老人家的健康；方老太太并将应邀到北京去见见自己热爱的领袖——毛主席。（新华社）
