    Fushun Municipal People's Government Agency Cooperative
    Illegally Engages in Speculation
    The Municipal People's Government Has Handled it Correctly
    Editor's Note: In May of this year, we received a letter from the Labor Insurance Department of the Fushun Coal Mine Trade Union, in which they exposed the Fushun Municipal People's Government Agency Staff Consumer Cooperative for violating cooperative regulations, aiming for profit, and problems with profit distribution. This is a fundamental issue that changes the nature of the cooperative. At the same time, this matter also reflects the growth of capitalist ideology among certain cadres of the Fushun Municipal People's Government. After receiving this letter, we forwarded it to the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for investigation. It has now been proven that the allegations in the letter are completely factual. The Fushun Municipal People's Government has taken correct action on this matter. The following is a summary of the Fushun Municipal People's Government's investigation and handling of this matter:

Editor:
    We have received your letter exposing and criticizing the Fushun Municipal People's Government Agency Staff Consumer Cooperative for illegal operations. The Fushun Municipal People's Government has investigated and dealt with this matter. The following is a summary of the Fushun Municipal People's Government's understanding and decision on this matter.

    I. The Fushun Municipal People's Government Agency Staff Consumer Cooperative was established in November 1949. According to the self-criticism of Du Yue, the deputy director of the cooperative's board of directors, the purpose of the cooperative's establishment was "mainly to make profits to solve the difficulties of cadres." Therefore, the cooperative's operation was entirely based on making money and distributing profits. From the beginning, it became a capitalist-type joint-stock store, not a cooperative.

    The cooperative frequently used the name of the cooperative to purchase goods in short supply on the market (such as cloth, sugar, etc.) from department stores or grain companies and wholesale them to private merchants. It then used the cash obtained to buy cheaper goods in Shenyang and sell them on the market. For example, in January 1950, the cooperative bought 1,000 kilograms of sugar from the department store and wholesaled it to private sugar houses. In May, it bought 15 bolts of white cotton cloth and wholesaled it to private merchants. In September, it transported 15 bolts of blue floral Da Ni (a type of woolen fabric) to Shenyang and sold them to private merchants, and used the cash obtained to engage in speculative trading on the market. In the six months from June to December of last year, for sugar alone, a total of 38,333 kilograms were purchased from department stores, with about 80 percent wholesaled to private merchants and only 20 percent retailed by the cooperative's store. Because the cooperative consistently engaged in speculation and profiteering, the capital turnover was often between four and seven times per month. The monthly turnover reached a maximum of 5.6 billion (then Northeast currency, the same below) and was often above 2 billion. Therefore, the cooperative made a large profit. All of this shows that the cooperative's operation completely violated cooperative regulations.

    II. Since the cooperative's operation aimed at pursuing profits, a few cadres with hedonistic thoughts engaged in a large number of speculative activities in the cooperative. For example, Zheng Fengxin, the deputy director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, not only invested 9 million yuan in his own name (300,000 yuan per share, for a total of 30 shares. The Fushun Municipal Cooperative Headquarters had stipulated that each member should not exceed 20 shares, but the cooperative's board of directors and supervisors arbitrarily changed the headquarters' instructions and allowed each person to join 30 shares.), but also invested 12 million yuan under the false names of Zheng Fenghai and Xiang Junyan; Guo Wenquan, the director of the Planning Committee, invested 6 million yuan in his own name and 6 million yuan under the name of Gao Fengming; Liu Zhe, the former director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau, invested 56.1 million yuan under the names of his parents and children. As a result, a very small number of people occupied most of the cooperative's funds and profits. After the central government announced the Cooperative Law, the Fushun Municipal Cooperative Headquarters revised its past instructions on the distribution of dividends on cooperative shares in accordance with the central government's regulations (that is, according to the Cooperative Law, only 15 percent of the net profit can be used for the distribution of dividends on shares). When Liu Zhe, Zheng Fengxin, Guo Wenquan, and others saw that the cooperative's profits were small, they demanded the withdrawal of their shares. Huang Bin, the director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, even questioned the director of the headquarters about the small amount of dividends.

    III. From its establishment to October 1950, the cooperative distributed dividends eight times, totaling more than 1.19 billion yuan. The average dividend per share was 1,049,300 yuan. Dividends accounted for 89 percent of the total net profit. Before the central government announced the Cooperative Law, the Fushun Municipal Cooperative Headquarters had instructed that 50 percent of the net profit in 1949 should be distributed as dividends, 40 percent should be used as public accumulation fund, and 3 percent should be used as member reward fund. After the central government clearly instructed in July 1950, the headquarters immediately instructed to implement Article 17 of the draft Cooperative Law promulgated by the central government: "The public accumulation fund shall not be less than 60 percent; the public welfare fund shall not exceed 10 percent; 10 percent shall be paid to the higher-level cooperative development fund; and the dividend on shares shall not exceed 15 percent." However, until October 1950, the cooperative still did not implement the provisions of the Cooperative Law, but distributed all the dividends to the members according to the original method; until February of this year, it continued to demand the distribution of more than 216 million yuan in stored dividends (which was not distributed due to the headquarters' firm prohibition).

    IV. Regarding the above events, the Fushun Municipal People's Government has submitted a request to the Northeast People's Government for approval and has decided to handle it as follows:

    (1) Based on the above circumstances, the cooperative has ceased to be a cooperative, so it has been decided to dissolve it. The Fushun Municipal People's Government Staff Consumer Cooperative should be reorganized in accordance with the Cooperative Law and the Cooperative Organization Charter.

    (2) The existing profit of more than 216 million yuan, as well as the dividends obtained from the illegally invested shares of Guo Wenquan, Zheng Fengxin, Liu Zhe, and others, shall be recovered and transferred to the Fushun Municipal Cooperative Headquarters as the cooperative development fund.

    (3) The board of directors and supervisors of the cooperative violated the instructions of the higher authorities and made decisions without authorization. They should make a self-criticism and publish it in the newspaper.

    (4) The mistake of a small number of cadres investing under false names should be criticized and submitted to the People's Supervision Committee for disciplinary action.

    (5) The municipal government leadership failed to promptly check and correct the errors of the cooperative. In addition to making a self-criticism, it should also report to the Northeast People's Government for handling.

    抚顺市人民政府机关合作社
    违法进行投机买卖
    该市人民政府已作正确处理
    编者按：今年五月间，我们接到抚顺市煤矿总工会劳动保险部的一封来信，在这封信里，他们揭发了抚顺市人民政府机关职工消费合作社违反合作社规章，以营利为目的，以及分红上的一些问题。这是一个改变了合作社性质的原则问题。同时，这件事也反映了抚顺市人民政府某些干部中滋生着资本主义思想。我们接到这封来信以后，即转请中共抚顺市委会进行调查，现证明来信揭发的完全是事实，对此，抚顺市人民政府已作了正确的处理。以下是抚顺市人民政府对这件事调查处理的情况：编辑同志：
    你们寄来关于揭露与批评抚顺市人民政府机关职工消费合作社违法经营的信收到了，此事已经抚顺市人民政府进行调查并作了处理。下面是抚顺市人民政府关于这件事的情况了解和处理决定的摘要。
    一、抚顺市人民政府机关职工消费合作社于一九四九年十一月成立，据该社理事会副主任杜越检讨说：该社成立的目的“主要是为了营利以解决干部困难。”因此，该社的经营完全是从赚钱分红出发，一开始就成为资本主义性质的合股商店，而不是什么合作社。
    该社经常利用合作社名义到百货公司或粮食公司买来市场感到缺乏的货物（如布匹，砂糖等）批发给私商，再以换来之现金到沈阳买回便宜货物，向市场推销。如：一九五○年一月该社从百货公司买来砂糖一千斤，批发给私营糖房，五月间买来白洋布十五匹，批发给私商，九月间又将十五匹青花达呢运到沈阳卖给私商，并用换来的现金在市场上进行投机买卖。去年六月至十二月这半年之内，单单是砂糖一项，总计由百货公司买进三万八千三百三十三斤，批发给私商者约占百分之八十，本社门市零售只占百分之二十。由于该社一贯投机取巧，资金周转每月常在四次至七次之间，一个月的营业额最多到过五十六亿（当时的东北币，以下同）以上，经常情况下也在二十亿以上，因此该社获利很大。这些都说明了该社的经营完全违反了合作社法规。
    二、该社的经营既以追逐利润为目的，少数有着享受思想的干部，就在该社进行了大量的投机行为，如：工商局副局长郑凤信除以自己名字入股九百万元（每股三十万元，共为三十股。抚顺市合作总社曾规定每个社员不得超过二十股，而该社理监事会竟擅自变动总社指示，准许每人可加入三十股。）以外，又以假名郑凤海、项俊岩入股一千二百万元；计划委员会处长郭文泉以自己名字入股六百万元，并假借高凤鸣之名入股六百万元；原文化处处长刘哲以其父母小孩等六个人的名字，入股五千六百一十万元。这样一来，很少数的人就占去了合作社资金和利润的大部分。中央公布合作社法以后，抚顺市合作总社曾根据中央的规定更改了该社过去有关合作社股金分红的指示（即按合作社法规定：只能以纯利的百分之十五用作股金分红），刘哲、郑凤信、郭文泉等人一看合作社利小了，就要求抽回股金。民政局局长黄滨并曾为了少分红的事去质问了总社的主任。
    三、该社自成立到一九五○年十月止，八次共分出红利十一亿九千万元以上。平均每股分红一百零四万九千三百元。分红占纯利总额的百分之八十九。在中央未公布合作社法以前，抚顺市合作总社对一九四九年纯益处理，曾经指示以百分之五十分红，百分之四十作为公积金，百分之三为社员奖励金。从一九五○年七月中央明确指示后，总社即指示按照中央公布的合作社法草案第十七条“公积金不得少于百分之六十；公益金不超过百分之十；缴纳上级合作事业建设基金百分之十；股金分红不超过百分之十五”执行。但该社至一九五○年十月仍不执行合作社法的规定，而以原办法将全部红利分给社员；直到今年二月止，还继续要求分配存储的红利二亿一千六百多万元（由于总社坚决制止故未分）。
    四、对以上事件，抚顺市人民政府已呈请东北人民政府批准，决定作如下处理：
    （一）根据上述情况，该社已不成为合作社，故决定解散。抚顺市人民政府职工消费合作社应根据合作社法及合作社组织章程另行组织。
    （二）现存的二亿一千六百多万元的盈利，以及郭文泉、郑凤信、刘哲等人非法投进的股金所分得的红利等一律追回，拨缴抚顺市合作总社作为合作事业基金。
    （三）该社的理、监事会违背上级指示擅作决定，应作检讨并在报上公布。
    （四）少数干部假名入股的错误，除责其检讨外，并提交人民监察委员会给以纪律处分。
    （五）市人民政府领导上对该社错误未予及时检查纠正，除应检讨外，并报请东北人民政府处理。
