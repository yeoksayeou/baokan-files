Xinhua News Agency, August 28th Dispatch from New York by TASS: The Soviet delegation to the San Francisco conference arrived in New York on the ship "Queen Elizabeth" on the 27th. The head of the delegation, Gromyko, made the following statement to reporters:

"The Soviet delegation has come to attend the San Francisco conference to participate in the review of a very important issue, namely the treaty of peace with Japan. As the Soviet government has previously stated, the Soviet delegation will put forward its own proposals for the treaty of peace with Japan. Naturally, these proposals will be announced at the San Francisco conference.

"We hope that these proposals will receive the support of all countries that truly endorse a treaty of peace with Japan that will lay the foundation for the establishment of normal relations between Japan and other countries (especially those countries that have suffered the most from Japanese aggression), and thereby lay the foundation for lasting peace in the Far East."

    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：苏联派来参加旧金山会议的代表团乘“伊利萨白皇后”号轮船于二十七日到达纽约。代表团团长葛罗米柯对记者发表谈话如下：
    “苏联代表团前来出席旧金山会议，是要参加审议一项极为重要的问题，即对日和约问题。正如苏联政府曾经声明过的，苏联代表团将提出自己对于对日和约的建议。自然，这些建议将在旧金山会议上予以宣布。
    “我们希望这些建议获得一切真正赞同这样一种对日和约的国家的支持，这种和约会奠定日本与其他国家（特别是受日本侵略之害最重的国家）建立正常关系的基础，并从而奠定远东持久和平的基础。”
