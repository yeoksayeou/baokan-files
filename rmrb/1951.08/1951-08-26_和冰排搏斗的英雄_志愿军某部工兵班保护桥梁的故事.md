(Sixteen) Although it was getting dark, more and more soldiers continued to jump onto the rafts and fight the ice floes. They inherited the heroic spirit of Comrade Wang Shirong's sacrifice, disregarding the cold and forgetting their fatigue, fighting to complete the arduous task. At this time, the sound of explosions and the cracking of ice reverberated on both banks. In the face of the soldiers' courage and wisdom, the power of nature seemed even smaller.

(Seventeen) Finally, the engineering soldiers not only protected the original bridge, but also added a new bridge. Trucks and carts transporting supplies to the front line continued to roll forward on the two bridges. These are the wheels of historical progress, the wheels that Wang Shirong and other Communist Party members led the way in pushing forward, wheels that no one can stop. (End)

    和冰排搏斗的英雄
    ——志愿军某部工兵班保护桥梁的故事

    （十六）天气虽然黑下来了，但是更多的战士又继续不断地跳上木筏，和冰块搏斗。他们继承着王世荣同志英勇牺牲的精神，不顾寒冷，忘记了疲困，为完成艰巨的事业而斗争。此时，爆炸声、冰块的破裂声，震荡着两岸。在战士们的勇敢和智慧面前，大自然的力量显得更其渺小了。
    （十七）最后，工兵战士们不仅保护了原来的大桥，并且还添了一座新桥。向前线运送给养的汽车、大车不断的在两座桥上滚滚前进。这是历史前进的车轮，是王世荣和其他共产党员带头推动前进的车轮，这是谁也阻止不住的车轮。（完）
