　　French Communist "L'Humanité" Points Out:
    The United States Creates Difficulties to Make Negotiations Fail
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 8th] The French Communist Party's organ, "L'Humanité," commented on the Korean armistice negotiations on the 6th, pointing out: "The new difficulties created by the Americans in the Kaesong negotiations were planned by them long ago." "L'Humanité" cited a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on August 4th, which said: Ridgway is preparing for a showdown and has no intention of continuing negotiations on the buffer zone issue. Therefore, "L'Humanité" said: "Obviously, the Americans have been systematically looking for excuses, even the most trivial ones."
    "L'Humanité" added: "The Supreme Command of the People's Army is patiently seeking an agreement. The Americans, however, have adopted a stubborn attitude, creating difficulties in an attempt to make the negotiations fail. The contrast between these two attitudes is clear to everyone."
    "L'Humanité" pointed out the United States' repeated attempts to sabotage the negotiations, saying: "The rulers in Washington are afraid of peace. The speeches of many political figures have revealed this. Wilson, Acheson, and Truman have successively delivered speeches, openly expressing their fear that the great desire for peace caused by the start of the Korean armistice negotiations would affect their war preparations."
    Finally, "L'Humanité" called on: "The people must intensify their activities to strive for peace, to thwart their conspiracies, just as they forced them to start negotiations a month ago, to force them to agree to an armistice."

　　法共《人道报》指出：
    美国制造困难图使谈判失败
    【新华社布拉格八日电】法国共产党机关报《人道报》六日在评论朝鲜停战谈判时指出：“美国人在开城谈判中制造的新的困难，是他们早就预先策划的。”《人道报》援用了路透社东京八月四日的一条电讯，其中说：李奇微正在准备摊牌，而且他已无意再继续谈判缓冲地带的问题了。因此，《人道报》说：“显然，美国人一直在有计划地找寻借口，甚至是最琐细的借口。”
    《人道报》又说：“人民军最高司令部是耐心地寻求协议的。而美国人却采取顽固的态度，制造困难企图使谈判失败。这两种态度的对比是谁都看得清楚的。”
    《人道报》指出美国三番五次地破坏谈判的企图说：“华盛顿的统治者们害怕和平。许多政界人物的谈话都透露了这一点。威尔生、艾奇逊、杜鲁门相继发表演说，公开表示害怕因朝鲜停战谈判开始而引起的巨大的和平愿望会影响他们的备战事业。”
    最后，《人道报》号召：“人民必须加紧争取和平的活动，来挫败他们的阴谋，就像一个月前迫使他们开始谈判一样，迫使他们同意停战。”
