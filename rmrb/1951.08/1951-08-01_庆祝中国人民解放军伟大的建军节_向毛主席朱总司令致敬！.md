　　Celebrating the Great Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Paying Respects to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!
　　　　Always the glorious "Model Company" in twenty-two years of combat
　　　　-- A letter from all commanders and fighters of the "Red Ninth Company"

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

Our company was formed in 1929 from part of the armed uprising led by Comrade Cheng Zihua in Daye County, Hubei. It started as a guerrilla unit and was later reorganized into the Sixth Company of the 12th Regiment of the 4th Division of the Red Third Army Corps. Now it is the Ninth Company of the ×× Regiment of the ×× Division of the People's Liberation Army. Although the designation has changed several times, it retains its glorious history, and people always affectionately and habitually call us the "Red Ninth Company."

For twenty-two years, the "Red Ninth Company" has always stood at the forefront of the Chinese people's revolutionary war. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, it participated in two attacks on Changsha and five counter-encirclement campaigns. During the 25,000-li Long March, the Red Ninth Company was one of the units that completed the task of protecting the central leaders and the entire army in crossing the Wujiang River and the Dadu River. At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Red Ninth Company advanced behind enemy lines and participated in the Pingxingguan Great Battle, annihilating a brigade of the Japanese Invader Itagaki Division. In the Liangshan battle to open up the Huxi base area, our army annihilated a Japanese battalion, and the Red Ninth Company was the assault company in this battle. During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, after participating in the battle, it marched to the frontier and fought in Jin, Chahar, Rehe, and Suiyuan, participating in the battles to defend Chengde and Zhangjiakou. After returning to Hebei, Shandong, and Henan in 1947, it launched offensives on the Longhai Line and swept through the battles in northern Henan. It then followed Liu and Deng's army across the Yellow River, made a thousand-li leap into the Dabie Mountains, made contributions to opening up the Dabie Mountains and liberating the Central Plains in many battles, and the great Huaihai Battle. In 1949, millions of troops crossed the Yangtze River, and the Red Ninth Company was one of the first assault companies to land. After crossing the river, it participated in the battles to liberate Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang, and later marched into the Great Southwest to participate in the battles to liberate Shaping and Chengdu. After that, it returned to Guizhou and successfully completed the tasks of suppressing bandits and mobilizing the masses in one year.

Twenty-two years of uninterrupted combat, under your teachings, we have not only learned guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare, but also learned siege warfare, and become a combat team that can defend and attack, and master the art of war.

We are also a working team that closely connects with the masses and is good at mobilizing and organizing the masses. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we mobilized the masses to persist in the struggle in the Huxi base area. In the most difficult years, each person could only eat seven liang of black beans a day, and had to save one liang to help the victims. In 1950, when carrying out the task of suppressing bandits and consolidating political power in Renhuai County, Guizhou, we successfully opened up the work of two districts within a year, organized 26,000 members of the Farmers' Association, 1,800 children's team members, established 2,400 joint defense self-defense teams, and more than 3,000 militiamen. We also helped the masses carry 16,000 dan of water, 1,300 dan of manure, and harvested and transplanted 300 mu of rice in our spare time.

We have suffered casualties in combat, but due to the attention to preserving and cultivating backbones, a large number of new members have been replenished, and they can still inherit all the traditions of the Red Ninth Company. We not only pay attention to the political level and work ability of existing cadres, but also pay attention to selecting outstanding elements from the soldiers. Over the past twenty-two years, a large number of outstanding military and political cadres have emerged. Since 1947, 98 cadres above the platoon level have been transferred from our company. Therefore, the Red Ninth Company is also known as the "Cadre Training Instructor Team."

For twenty-two years, the Red Ninth Company has always been praised as a "Model Company." Since 1947 alone, it has won 15 collective merits, 15 honorary banners, and 15 model squads and platoons, and 108 combat heroes and model workers have emerged successively.

We have achieved the above achievements mainly by carrying out work in accordance with Chairman Mao's military building thought, giving play to the core role of the Communist Party branch in the company, grasping the proletarian ideological education and the education of the tradition of honor in the army, carrying forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, paying attention to cultivating cadres in a timely manner, promoting democracy, caring for soldiers, and achieving unity between officers and soldiers, and unity from top to bottom. On the occasion of commemorating the 24th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, we swear to you: We must prevent complacency, maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of the "Red Ninth Company." We must work harder to study and build ourselves into a modernized national defense force, vigilantly defend national defense, and be ready to serve the motherland at any time!

Respectfully wish you
Good health!

Respectfully, all commanders and fighters of the Red Ninth Company

　　　　We are stepping up training on the southern coastal defense line of the motherland to improve our skills and defend the border
　　　　-- A letter from the "Tashan Hero Regiment" of the Fourth Field Army

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

The great Army Day is coming. On the occasion of commemorating the 24th anniversary of the birth of our army, all comrades of our "Tashan Hero Regiment" extend our cordial and high respects to you and report to you on our work.

In the Northeast Liberation Campaign in 1948, under the wise leadership of the Party and you, after six days and nights of bloody battle, we blocked the ten divisions of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, which was personally commanded by the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek to reinforce Jinzhou and attempted to save the fate of the Northeast Chiang bandit army, before the Tashan position, and shattered the joint sea and air offensive of the Chiang bandits, creating the Tashan Blockade Battle, which was famous at home and abroad. Therefore, we were awarded the glorious title of "Tashan Hero Regiment." Since then, we immediately entered the customs to liberate Pingjin, and were personally reviewed by you in Beijing. In the spring of 1949, we accepted your order to advance, crossed the Yellow River, crossed the Yangtze River, made a thousand-li Long March, and swept away the remnants of the Chiang and Bai bandits entrenched in the Central South continent. After a year of continuous marching and combat, we finally arrived at the coast of the South China Sea of the motherland.

After the liberation of the entire Central South China, since May last year, we have also followed your instructions and carried out the glorious task of suppressing bandits and defending the coastal defense.

In order to complete the task of suppressing bandits, in the five months from May to September last year, we annihilated 3,819 bandits and seized 5,312 guns; the whole regiment organized nine work teams with more than 350 comrades to mobilize the masses in 24 townships, transformed 185 village regimes, and established 175 village farmers' associations, laying a solid foundation for the land reform in the驻地 [zhù dì - garrison location].

In the patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, we recognized that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, especially the U.S. imperialism's aggressive war in Korea, the occupation of our Taiwan and the conspiracy to rearm Japan, which aroused our unparalleled indignation. The soldiers said in unison: "The Communist Party led us to shed blood and sweat to establish a new China. We must resolutely defend peace and not let the motherland return to the dark days of the past!"

On the ideological basis of defending the motherland and defending peace, we launched a large-scale military training, which has significantly improved the military skills of the entire regiment. In the training, revolutionary heroism was generally carried forward, and hundreds of military training heroes and many model squads and platoons emerged. The soldiers said: "Our skills have improved. If U.S. imperialism dares to invade us, we guarantee to eliminate them with one shot each!"

Now, U.S. imperialism, under the heavy blow of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the opposition of peace-loving people all over the world, has had to accept the Korean armistice negotiations; we will never relax our fighting spirit because of the peace talks. As long as imperialism exists in the world, we must hold the weapons in our hands tightly to defend the motherland and world peace!

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu: In the past, under your wise leadership, we went from victory to victory. We will always follow you and advance victoriously!

Respectfully wish you
Good health

　　　　Bring the fighting spirit of defending Langya Mountain to the place where the motherland needs it!
　　　　-- A letter from Comrade Ge Zhenlin, one of the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

I am one of the five warriors who defended Langya Mountain. My name is Ge Zhenlin, and I am currently working in the Public Security Corps of the Hunan Military Region. As we welcome the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, recalling the battle ten years ago is like yesterday. Langya Mountain is the gateway to the eastern front of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. In the autumn of 1941, the Japanese invaders launched a large-scale "mopping-up" operation against Langya Mountain. Under the personal command of Regiment Commander Qiu Wei, comrades of our regiment launched a counter-"mopping-up" struggle and won a brilliant victory.

At dawn on September 25, the Japanese devils concentrated 3,000 troops and launched an attack on us from nine directions simultaneously. Our regimental headquarters was located on Qipantuo, the summit of Langya Mountain. Regiment Commander Qiu ordered our company commander to take two platoons to cover the transfer of the main force of the entire regiment, retreat in order to advance, and annihilate the enemy. After our two platoons successfully completed the cover task, in order to cover the retreat of these two platoons again, our party group leader Ma Baolin was the first to shout: "I will cover!" Immediately afterwards, Song Xueyi, Hu Fucai, Hu Delin, and I all said: "We will follow you!"

The two platoons safely withdrew under the leadership of the company commander; at this time, the Japanese devils' artillery fire was pouring down on us like heavy rain mixed with hailstones. Wherever we five retreated, the enemy's artillery fire followed. Finally, Ma Baolin directed us to retreat to a cliff that no one had ever reached. The Japanese devils wanted to climb up, but before we could shoot, eight of them had already fallen to their deaths. The devils were not willing to give up and climbed up again; at this critical moment, I knew that a Communist Party member should not be afraid of sacrifice and take the lead in killing the enemy, so I encouraged my comrades and said: "We are Chairman Mao's soldiers, we must fight resolutely, and kill one for every one that comes!" In this way, we repelled three enemy assaults in a row.

When the enemy launched the fourth assault, we only had five grenades left in our hands. We used four grenades to repel the enemy, and the last one was tightly held in Ma Baolin's hand. Our ammunition was exhausted, with enemies on three sides and a cliff on the other, what should we do? At that time, Ma Baolin called out: "We would rather die than be captured!" I immediately responded: "Yes! Chairman Mao's soldiers can only fight to the end resolutely, we must not surrender, it is the most glorious thing to sacrifice for the motherland and the people!" So, we smashed our guns, and the five of us jumped off the cliff at the same time.

Song Xueyi and I were caught by tree branches and did not die; the next day, we safely returned to the troops and participated in the counter-"mopping-up" operation.

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu: Now when I think back to those difficult and arduous days, who gave us the greatest courage? Who led us to today's great victory? It is the Communist Party and you!

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and you, we defeated the Japanese invaders, drove away the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and expelled imperialism. Just as the destroyed factories had just begun to smoke again, and the fields that had been bombed into craters everywhere had just been planted with crops, and the people across the country were moving towards a peaceful and happy life, U.S. imperialism came again to invade our territory of Taiwan and our neighboring country of Korea, and rearmed Japan and illegally prepared to make a separate peace with Japan, seriously infringing upon our country's sacred right to conclude a treaty with Japan, and endangering our country's security. Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu: I resolutely oppose this aggressive behavior of U.S. imperialism, so I guarantee to you: I will always be a warrior who defends the motherland and defends peace, and bring the fighting spirit of defending Langya Mountain to the place where the motherland needs it!

Respectfully wish you
Good health
Ge Zhenlin, a warrior who defended Langya Mountain

　　　　Be a hero in battle, and a model in study
　　　　Determined to be a good soldier with both cultural and military skills
　　　　-- A letter from Comrade Wang Yushan, a combat hero of a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

On the eve of the 24th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, I am writing this letter to greet you and report on my current situation.

Since I was wounded in the bandit suppression in Zhouwu Village, northeast of Qinzhou, Guangdong, I have been deeply moved by the care and love shown to me by leaders at all levels. After more than four months of careful treatment at Wuhan Army Hospital, my injured left arm has now fully recovered.

After I returned to the troops, welcome rallies were held five times. Leaders at all levels called on all comrades to learn from my patriotism and revolutionary heroism, and to launch a meritorious service campaign. After three days of discussion by the entire unit, many companies have also checked the meritorious service campaign, and many squads, platoons, and individuals have formulated detailed and specific plans for meritorious service. The regiment I was in once convened a forum of 42 combat heroes from the entire regiment, and everyone unanimously expressed that they must maintain the glory of combat heroes and carry forward this glory. My comrades-in-arms in the "Crossing the Sea Hero Company," who won the honor of "Crossing the Sea Hero Company" in the Hainan Island Campaign, discussed it even more enthusiastically, and everyone swore under the red banner of the "Crossing the Sea Hero Company": "We must train our skills well and defend the motherland!"

Now, I am studying in the cultural team of the师教导队 [shī jiào dǎo duì - division training unit], and Comrade Xiao Guodong, who won the title of shooting hero for defending Height 105 with me in the Hainan Island Campaign, is also here. He is my old comrade-in-arms and also one of our thirteen warriors. The two of us have jointly made up our minds: "Under the education of the Party, we are heroes in battle, and we must also be models in study!" I personally feel that the effort I have made for the people is still very small, so I am determined to strengthen my study, make great achievements again, and be your good soldier with both cultural and military skills!

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu: Whenever the motherland needs me, I will respond to your call, and I am always preparing to defend the motherland and defend peace!

Respectfully
Greetings
Wang Yushan

(Note: Wang Yushan is one of the thirteen warriors of a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army who tenaciously defended Height 105 in the Hainan Island Campaign. Later, he was seriously wounded but did not leave the front line in the bandit suppression in Zhouwu Village, northeast of Qinzhou, and became a Matrosov-type people's hero by using his back to block the enemy's machine gun eye.)

　　　　We are stationed on the frontier of the motherland
　　　　Always vigilant against imperialist aggressive conspiracies
　　　　-- A letter from the "Zhang Yingcai Steel营 [yíng - battalion]" guarding the southwestern border

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

In the spring of 1950, we were ordered to advance to the southwestern border of the motherland. Under your wise instructions and calls, for the past year we have been fighting heroically day and night to defend the motherland's border and build national defense, and have achieved many successes.

Under the方針 [fāng zhēn - policy] of "Unite with fraternal nationalities, jointly consolidate and build national defense," we have eliminated bandits and initially mobilized and organized the masses. We often cleared bandits in the dangerous mountains and primitive forests filled with瘴雾 [zhàng wù - miasma], regardless of dangers. There was a time when the troops could only eat a small amount of corn and thin porridge or some wild vegetables every day, and could not take off their clothes to sleep day and night. Usually, the comrades would rather go barefoot and save their straw sandals for bandit clearing. The comrades overcame all difficulties and finally eliminated these bandits used by the U.S. and Chiang reactionaries to undermine our national defense construction.

In order to unite the fraternal nationalities, we extensively publicized the民族政策 [mín zú zhèng cè - nationality policy]. The soldiers also automatically used their allowances to buy items such as tobacco, sauce, and salt that the fraternal nationalities needed most and gave them to them. In the gaps between bandit clearing, we also helped them transplant seedlings, carry water, push mills, carry manure, and even cut their hair. We did whatever work they needed. Through all these activities, we eliminated the historical隔阂 [gé hé - estrangement] caused by大汉族主义 [dà hàn zú zhǔ yì - Han chauvinism] between nationalities, and established a brotherly relationship and a close relationship with the fraternal nationalities on the border. They said everywhere, "Chairman Mao's troops have come, and we have finally seen the light of day. We have been oppressed for generations, and today we can finally see the end of it."

The fraternal nationalities border compatriots have deeply realized from their personal experiences that the People's Liberation Army is their own army and actively help us. They led the troops, sent letters, organized stretcher teams, and took care of the wounded in bandit clearing. Many old grandmothers with white hair climbed the hills in the rain to deliver food to the soldiers on guard. In a bandit clearing, men and women, old and young of the fraternal nationalities took sickles and土枪 [tǔ qiāng - home-made guns], and cooperated with the troops to surround the bandits from various hills and capture more than 400 bandits alive.

After a year of arduous combat, our entire营 [yíng - battalion] has残灭 [cán miè - destroyed] a total of 2,451 bandits and helped various fraternal nationalities establish their own people's armed forces. Now, the bandits on the border have been basically eliminated, and the beautiful border of the motherland has been further consolidated. On the hills, in the villages, and along the roads, there are fraternal nationalities militia哨岗 [shào gǎng - sentry posts] everywhere. They cherish the happiness that Chairman Mao has given them, and are therefore very vigilant against any destructive activities by bandits and特务 [tè wù - secret agents].

Under the education of the Party, our "Steel营 [yíng - battalion]" has experienced countless battles and is now more determined to guard the border of the motherland, always be vigilant against imperialist conspiracies of aggression, resolutely strike at any enemy who dares to invade the motherland, and complete the sacred task entrusted to us by you and the people of the whole country. We will fight to the end for the safety and happiness of the people of the motherland and for the defense of lasting peace in the East and the world.

"Zhang Yingcai Steel营 [yíng - battalion]"

(Note: Zhang Yingcai is a combat hero of the People's Liberation Army. The营 [yíng - battalion] he commanded was awarded the title of "Steel营 [yíng - battalion]" for its meritorious service in the Huaihai Campaign. The "Zhang Yingcai Steel营 [yíng - battalion]" began to take on the task of guarding the southwestern border a year ago. This letter was written by them before the "August 1st" Army Day.)

　　　　Our gunboats on the ocean of the motherland
　　　　Defeated the enemy and guaranteed the safety of transportation
　　　　-- A letter from all commanders and fighters of the "Sea Hero Boat"

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

The 24th anniversary of the founding of the army is coming soon. We would like to report to you the deeds of how our gunboats defeated the enemy on the ocean of the motherland.

On the morning of June 24, our boat and three friendly boats were tasked with escorting to Haimen. When we sailed to the Toumen Mountain sea area outside Haimen, we discovered four enemy机轮 [jī lún - motor vessels]. Our boat immediately went full speed ahead and rushed up. Due to our boat's sudden attack, the enemy ships fled in panic. Under the command and encouragement of艇长 [tǐng zhǎng - boat commander] Yang Yue and指导员 [zhǐ dǎo yuán - political instructor] Chen Lifu, our boat went full speed ahead and chased quickly, and bombarded the enemy ships with fierce and accurate炮火 [pào huǒ - artillery fire]. The enemy ships concentrated their火力 [huǒ lì - firepower] in an attempt to resist stubbornly. At this time, the enemy on Toumen Mountain was only 100 meters to 300 meters away from us, and also joined in shooting at us. Although our boat was completely trapped in the火网 [huǒ wǎng - web of fire], five of the thirteen people on the boat were wounded; however, the comrades were not afraid at all, and the comrades in the engine room who could leave the machines also came to the deck to fight. We fired at the enemy accurately and fiercely, and finally set the enemy ships on fire.

During the battle, Liu Heming was wounded in the head and passed out, but continued to fight after waking up. 指导员 [zhǐ dǎo yuán - political instructor] Chen Lifu had not eaten well for three days due to illness, but still led everyone to fight bravely. Communist Party member Wang Weifu was wounded four times, but still insisted on fighting until the end of the battle. Cook Chen Jintang served as a shooter in the battle and was shot through the stomach by a bullet; the comrades helped him into the cabin, but he still sat up and asked to fight again. Zhou Yizhong, the舵手 [duò shǒu - helmsman] comrade, insisted on舵 [duò - steering] for eleven hours. The comrades in the engine room were red-eyed and pale due to the stuffy heat and tense work, and persisted until the end of the battle. Our lone boat fought fiercely with four bandit ships for 20 minutes and damaged one enemy motor vessel. At this time, the gunboats behind us caught up, and the enemy ships fled in a hurry. Our boat and our brother boats chased directly to the vicinity of Yijiangshan and sank another large enemy motor vessel.

In this battle, we打击 [dǎ jī - struck a blow to] the enemy and guaranteed the safety of transportation, so the base leader named our boat the "Sea Hero Boat". Before this "August 1" Army Day, we would like to express to you that we must continue to work hard, improve our skills, resolutely eliminate the enemies on the ocean of the motherland, and consolidate the coastal defense of the motherland.

All commanders and fighters of the "Sea Hero Boat" of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy

　　　　We have been on the Korean front for more than eight months
　　　　More than a thousand operations have been done very well
　　　　-- A letter from Comrade Li Landing

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

As the 24th anniversary of the founding of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army is approaching, I would like to extend to you the warmest and most sublime greetings, and wish you good health.

Last November, we voluntarily organized a surgical team to go to the Korean front. Over the past eight months, we have carried forward the excellent tradition of health work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and have performed more than 1,200 major and minor operations in the front-line hospitals and volunteer combat troops. Because of our careful and serious work, the results of the operations have been very good, and there has never been an accident. We have tried to widely replace inhalation general anesthesia with intravenous general anesthesia. This method not only allows the wounded to wake up quickly, but also has no pain after waking up. The wounded and sick soldiers are very satisfied with us, and they feel happy when they see us. All kinds of staff in our surgical team are also very united. We also used the gaps in our work to conduct various professional education for the medical workers who were originally in the front. However, we will never be complacent about all this, and we must continue to work hard at all times to do our work better.

Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu: The comrades of I and the surgical team always miss you, especially when the environment is tense and the work is difficult, as long as we think of you, we will have more strength. Even in the ice and snow, we will feel hot all over. Whenever I encounter difficult problems to deal with and feel that I am too young and lack experience, I have the courage when I think of you. Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu: The wounded comrades also miss you very much. There was a wounded soldier whose hand muscles were frozen to death. That morning he looked at his hands hopefully and said: "It would be good if Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu knew, it would be good if Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu were healthy." I told him that Chairman Mao would know, and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu were healthy, and he smiled happily.

I feel honored that we can stand on the front line of defending the motherland, defending the East and world peace. Every operation we complete and the diagnosis, treatment, or care of every wounded soldier is a contribution to defending peace and打击 [dǎ jī - striking a blow to] U.S. imperialism. Although the environment is tense and the work is busy, and some comrades have become ill as a result, our work efficiency is improving day by day, and our combat will is becoming stronger day by day. All of us in the volunteer surgical team have unanimously expressed that we will stand on the front line of peace without slackening, and be ready to give aggressors a serious blow at any time. In order to defend the motherland and world peace, I will definitely dedicate myself with infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause of serving the wounded and sick soldiers.
Li Landing

(Note: Model medical worker Comrade Li Landing is currently the captain of the Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Volunteer Surgical Team of Shanghai Military Medical University and has recently returned from Korea.)

　　庆祝中国人民解放军伟大的建军节  向毛主席朱总司令致敬！
            在二十二年来战斗生活中
            始终是光荣的“模范连队”
            ——“红九连”全体指战员的信敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    我们这个连队是一九二九年，由程子华同志在湖北大冶县率领起义的武装的一部分组成的，开始是一支游击队，后来改编为红三军团四师十二团第六连，现在是人民解放军××师×团第九连，虽然番号几经变更，但因为它保有光荣的历史，人们总亲切习惯地称我们为“红九连”。
    二十二年来，“红九连”始终站在中国人民革命战争的最前线。第二次国内革命战争时期，参加了两次攻打长沙，五次反围剿的战役，在两万五千里长征途中，红九连是完成了掩护中央首长和全军抢渡乌江天险与大渡河任务的连队之一。抗日战争开始，红九连挺进敌后，参加了歼灭日寇坂垣师团一个旅团的平型关大歼灭战。在开辟湖西根据地的梁山战斗中，我军歼灭日寇一个大队，红九连是这个战斗的突击连，第三次国内革命战争时期，参加战役后，又远征塞外，转战晋、察、热、绥，参加保卫承德，张家口等战役。一九四七年回师冀、鲁、豫后，投入了出击陇海，扫荡豫北各战役。继又随刘邓大军渡黄河，千里跃进大别山立过战功，参加了开辟大别山区和解放中原的多次战役，和伟大的淮海战役。一九四九年百万大军渡长江，红九连是最先登岸的先头连队之一。过江后，参加解放江西、福建、浙江的战役，后来又进军大西南参加了解放沙坪、成都的战斗。此后回师贵州，一年中胜利完成剿匪和发动群众的任务。
    二十二年来无间断的战斗，在你们教养下，我们不但学会了游击战，运动战，而且学会了攻坚战，成为一支能守能攻，掌握战争艺术的战斗队。
    我们又是一支密切联系群众，善于鼓动和组织群众的工作队。抗日战争中我们发动群众坚持了湖西根据地的斗争，在最艰苦的岁月里，每人一天只能吃七两黑豆，还要节约一两救济灾民。一九五○年在贵州仁怀县执行剿匪与巩固政权的任务，一年内利用空隙，胜利开辟了两个区的工作，组织起农民协会会员两万六千人，儿童队员一千八百人，建立联防自卫队二千四百人，和三千多民兵，我们又在紧张工作之余，帮助群众挑水一万六千担，担粪一千三百担，割稻，插秧三百亩。
    我们在战斗中，不断有伤亡，但由于注意保存和培养骨干，使大批新成员补充进来后，仍能继承红九连的一切传统作风，我们不仅注意现有干部政治水平和工作能力，而且注意选拔战士中的优秀分子，二十二年来曾有大批优秀的军政干部。自一九四七年以来，我们连里调出排以上干部九十八人，因此，红九连又被誉为“培养干部教导队”。
    二十二年来，红九连始终被誉为“模范连队”，仅一九四七年至今，立了十五次集体功，荣获奖旗十五面，先后出现模范班、排十五个，战斗英雄和模范工作者一百零八名。
    我们能获得以上成绩，主要是按照毛主席的建军思想，进行了工作，发挥了连队里共产党支部的核心作用，抓紧了部队无产阶级的思想教育和荣誉的传统教育，发扬了人民解放军的光荣传统，及时注意培养干部，发扬民主，爱护战士，达到官兵团结，上下一致。在纪念“八一”建军节二十四周年的今天我们向您宣誓：我们一定防止骄傲自满情绪，保持与发扬“红九连”的光荣传统。我们一定要更加努力学习，把自己建设成为一支现代化的国防军，警惕地保卫国防，随时准备为祖国效劳！
        敬祝
    身体健康！
                                    红九连全体指战员敬上
            我们在祖国的南部海防线上
            加紧练兵提高本领保卫边疆
            ——四野“塔山英雄团”的信亲爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    伟大的建军节来了，我们“塔山英雄团”全体同志在纪念我军诞生二十四周年的节日，向您致以亲切崇高的敬礼，并向您报告我们的工作。
    一九四八年东北解放战斗中，我们在党和您的英明领导下，经六昼夜血战，将匪首蒋介石亲自指挥下的增援锦州、企图挽救东北蒋匪军命运的十个师兵力阻击在塔山阵地之前，并粉碎了蒋匪的海、空联合进攻，创造了名震中外的塔山阻击战，因此我们荣获了“塔山英雄团”的光荣称号。自此以后，我们就紧接着进关解放平津，并在北京荣获您的亲自检阅。一九四九年春天，我们又接受了您的进军命令，渡黄河，过长江，千里长征，横扫盘踞在中南大陆的蒋白残匪，经一年的连续行军作战，一直进抵祖国南海滨。
    中南全境解放后，自去年五月以来，我们又遵照着您的指示，执行了剿匪、保卫海防的光荣任务。
    在为完成剿匪任务中，我们在去年五月到九月的五个月中，歼灭了三千八百十九名土匪，缴获了五千三百十二枝枪；全团组织了有三百五十多名同志参加的九个工作队，发动了二十四个乡的群众，改造了一百八十五个村政权，建立了一百七十五个村的农会，为驻地打下了进行土地改革的巩固基础。
    在爱国主义的抗美援朝教育中，我们认清了美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，特别是美帝国主义在朝鲜发动的侵略战争，侵占我国台湾和重新武装日本的阴谋，更激起了我们无比的愤恨，战士们异口同声地说：“共产党领导我们流血流汗建立了新中国，我们要坚决保卫和平，不能再让祖国回到过去的黑暗日子！”
    在保卫祖国、保卫和平的思想基础上，我们展开了军事大练兵，使全团的军事技术有了显著的提高。在练兵中普遍发扬了革命英雄主义，出现数百名练兵功臣和许多模范班、排单位。战士们说：“我们本领提高了，假如美帝国主义敢来侵犯我们，保证一枪一个将它消灭光！”
    现在，美帝国主义在遭受到朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的沉重打击之下，和全世界爱好和平人民的反对下，不得已接受了朝鲜停战谈判；我们决不因和谈而松懈斗志，只要世界上帝国主义存在一天，我们就一定要握紧手中的武器，保卫祖国和世界和平！
    亲爱的毛主席、朱总司令：我们过去在您的英明领导下，从胜利走向了胜利，我们仍将永远跟随着您胜利前进！
            敬祝您们
    身体健康

                           “塔山英雄团”全体指战员敬上
            把坚守狼牙山的战斗精神
            带到祖国所需要的地方去！
            ——狼牙山五壮士之一葛振林同志的信敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    我是坚守狼牙山的五个战士当中的一个，叫葛振林，现在湖南军区公安总队工作。当我们迎接中国人民解放军建军节二十四周年的时候，回忆起十年前的战斗，就好像在昨天一样。狼牙山是晋察冀边区东线的大门。一九四一年秋天，日寇向狼牙山进行大“扫荡”，我们团的同志在邱蔚团长亲自指挥下，展开了反“扫荡”斗争，并获得了辉煌的胜利。
    九月二十五日拂晓，日本鬼子集中了三千兵力，分九路同时出动向我们进犯。我们团部正设在狼牙山山顶的棋盘陀上，邱团长命令我们连长带两个班掩护全团主力部队转移，以退为进，歼灭敌人。当我们两个班胜利完成掩护任务以后，为了再掩护这两个班的撤退，我们的党小组长马保林头一个喊出：“我打掩护！”紧接着，宋学义、胡福才、胡德林和我都一齐说：“我们跟着你！”
    两个班在连长的领导下安全的撤走了；这时，日本鬼子的炮火像大雨夹着冰雹似的向我们打来，我们五个人撤到那里，敌人的炮火跟到那里。最后，马保林指挥我们撤退到一个从没有人到过的悬崖上。日本鬼子想爬上来，还没等我们开枪，就已经跌死了八个。鬼子死不甘心，又向上爬；在这紧急关头，我知道一个共产党员应该不怕牺牲，带头杀敌，于是我就鼓励同志们说：“我们是毛主席的战士，要坚决打，来一个打死一个！”就是这样，我们接连打退了敌人三次冲锋。
    在敌人发起第四次冲锋的时候，我们的手里只剩下五颗手榴弹了，我们用四颗手榴弹打退了敌人，最后那颗紧握在马保林手里。弹药打光了，三面是敌人，一面是悬崖，怎么办呢？当时，马保林号召说：“宁死也不当俘虏！”我立刻响应说：“对！毛主席的战士只有坚决战斗到底，不能投降，为祖国，为人民牺牲是最光荣的！”于是，我们砸坏了枪枝，五个人同时跳下悬崖去。
    我和宋学义被树枝挂住，没有死；第二天，安全地回到了部队，参加了反“扫荡”作战。
    敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：现在我回想起来，在那艰难困苦的日子里，是谁给了我们以最大的勇敢呢？是谁领导着我们走向今天的伟大胜利呢？是共产党和您！
    在共产党和您的领导下，我们打败了日寇，赶走了蒋介石匪帮，驱逐了帝国主义。正当被毁坏了的工厂刚刚冒起烟来，被炸成遍地弹坑的田野刚刚种上庄稼，全国人民走向和平幸福的生活时，美帝国主义又来侵略我们的领土台湾和邻邦朝鲜，并重新武装日本和非法的准备单独对日媾和，严重地侵犯了我国对日缔结和约的神圣权利，危害了我国的安全。毛主席、朱总司令：我坚决反对美帝国主义这种侵略行为，因此我向您保证：永远做一个保卫祖国，保卫和平的战士，把坚守狼牙山的战斗精神带到祖国需要的地方去！
            敬祝
    身体健康

            打仗是英雄，学习要做模范
            决心做个文武双全的好战士
            ——四野某部战斗英雄王玉山同志的信敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    当人民解放军建军二十四周年纪念节前夕，我写这封信向您问候，并报告我现在的情况。
    我自从在广东省钦州东北的周屋村剿匪负伤后，各级首长对我的关心和爱护使我非常感动。在经过武汉陆军医院四个多月的细心治疗，现在我受伤的左臂已经完全痊愈。
    我回到部队后，光是欢迎大会就开了五次。各级首长号召全体同志学习我的爱国主义和革命英雄主义精神，开展立功运动。全部队经过三天讨论，并且有许多连队已检查了立功运动，很多班、排和个人都订立了详细具体的立功计划。我所在的团曾召集全团四十二名战斗英雄举行座谈会，大家一致表示一定要保持战斗英雄的光荣并发扬光大这个光荣。我所在的在海南岛战役中荣获“渡海英雄连”的战友们，讨论的更为热烈，大家并在“渡海英雄连”那面大红旗下宣誓：“一定练好本领，保卫祖国！”
    现在，我正在师教导队的文化队学习，海南岛战役中同我一起坚守一○五高地荣获射击英雄称号的萧国栋同志也在这里，他是我的老战友，也是我们十三勇士之一，我俩共同下了决心：“在党的教育下，咱们打仗是英雄，学习也一定要做模范！”我自己觉得为人民出的力还很小，所以我决心加强学习，再立大功，做您的一个文武双全的好战士！
    敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：祖国什么时候需要我，我就什么时候响应您的号召，我随时都在为保卫祖国、保卫和平而准备着！
        敬礼
    健康
                                                    王玉山
    （按：王玉山是第四野战军某部海南岛战役中顽强坚守一○五高地的十三勇士之一，后来在钦州东北的周屋村剿匪中负重伤不下火线，并以背堵住敌人机枪眼而成为马特洛索夫型的人民英雄。）
            我们坚守在祖国的边疆
            时刻警惕帝国主义侵略阴谋
            ——守卫在西南边疆的“张英才钢铁营”的信亲爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    一九五○年春，我们奉命挺进到祖国西南边疆。在您们的英明指示和号召下，一年来我们日夜为保卫祖国边疆，建设国防，进行着英勇的斗争，并已获得了不少成绩。
    我们在“团结兄弟民族，共同巩固、建设国防”的方针下，消灭了土匪，并初步发动和组织了群众。我们经常在瘴雾弥漫的深山和原始森林里，不避艰险地清剿土匪。有一个时期，部队每天只能吃到少许苞谷和稀饭，或吃些野菜，昼夜不能脱衣服睡觉。平时，同志们宁愿赤脚，把草鞋留到清剿土匪的时候穿。同志们克服了一切困难，终于消灭了这些美、蒋反动派用来破坏我们国防建设的土匪。
    为了团结兄弟民族，我们深入广泛地宣传了民族政策。战士们并自动用自己的津贴费，买了兄弟民族最需要的烟、酱、盐巴等物品送给他们。在剿匪空隙中间，我们还帮助他们插秧、担水、推磨、担粪，甚至给他们剃头，不管那样活我们都干。通过这一切活动，我们消除了历史上大汉族主义所造成的民族之间的隔阂，和边疆的兄弟民族建立了手足般的感情和血肉相连的关系。他们到处说：“毛主席的队伍来了，我们才见了青天。我们祖祖辈辈受欺压，今天可熬到头了。”
    边疆的兄弟民族同胞从他们亲身经历中，深深认识到了人民解放军是他们自己的军队，就积极帮助我们。他们在剿匪中给部队带路、送信，组织担架队，看护伤员。许多白发苍苍的老大妈，冒雨爬到山岗上给放哨的战士送饭吃。在一次剿匪中，兄弟民族男女老少拿着镰刀、土枪，配合部队从各个山岗上包围土匪，活捉了土匪四百多名。
    经过一年来的艰苦作战，我们全营共残灭土匪两千四百五十一名，并帮助各兄弟民族建立了自己的人民武装。现在，边疆的股匪已基本肃清了，美丽的祖国边疆已更加巩固。在山岗上、村落里、道路旁，到处都站着兄弟民族的民兵岗哨。他们非常珍贵毛主席给他们的幸福，因而非常警惕地严防土匪特务的任何破坏活动。
    我们“钢铁营”在党的教养下，经历过无数次战斗锻炼，现在更有决心坚守在祖国的边疆，时刻警惕着帝国主义的侵略阴谋，坚决打击任何敢于进犯祖国的敌人，完成你和全国人民交予我们的神圣任务。我们要为祖国人民的安全和幸福，为保卫东方和世界持久和平而战斗到底。
                                     “张英才钢铁营”
    （按张英才是人民解放军的战斗英雄，他所指挥的一个营，在淮海战役中因作战有功，荣获“钢铁营”的称号。“张英才钢铁营”在一年前开始担负了守卫西南边疆的任务，这封信是他们在“八一”建军节前写来的。）
            我们的炮艇在祖国的海洋上
            战胜了敌人保证了运输安全
            ——“海上英雄艇”全体指战员的信敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    建军二十四周年纪念日即将来到了。我们特向您们报告我们的炮艇在祖国海洋上怎样战胜了敌人的事迹。
    六月二十四日早晨，我艇与三艘友艇担任护送任务前往海门。当我们驶至海门外的头门山海面时，发现敌人四条机轮。我艇当即开足马力猛冲上去。由于我艇突然猛袭，敌船即仓皇逃窜。在艇长杨岳、指导员陈立富的指挥与鼓舞下，我艇开足马力急速直追，并用猛烈而准确的炮火轰击敌船。敌船集中火力企图顽抗。此时，头门山上的敌人距我只一百多公尺至三百公尺，也加入向我射击。虽然我艇完全陷入火网，艇上十三个人有五个负伤；但同志们毫无畏惧，轮机舱内能离开机器的同志亦到舱面来作战。我们准确而猛烈地向敌人射击，终于把敌船打得起火了。
    在战斗中，刘鹤鸣头部受伤晕过去了，醒来后仍然继续战斗。指导员陈立富因病已三天未很好吃饭，仍带领大家奋勇作战。共产党员王维福四度负伤，仍然坚持作战到战斗结束。炊事员陈金堂在战斗中担任射手，被子弹射穿了肚皮；同志们把他扶进舱里，他仍坐起来要求再战。操舵员周益忠同志坚持操舵十一小时。轮机舱内的同志因机舱闷热，工作紧张，熬红了眼，脸也发白了，一直坚持到战斗结束。我们孤艇与四只匪船激战二十分钟，打坏了敌机轮一艘。这时我们后面的炮艇赶上了，敌船慌忙逃窜。我艇与兄弟艇直追到一江山附近，又击沉了敌大机轮一艘。
    这次战斗中，我们打击了敌人，保证了运输的安全，基地首长因此命名我艇为“海上英雄艇”。值此“八一”建军节之前，我们向您们表示：今后一定要继续努力，提高技术，坚决肃清祖国海洋上的敌人，巩固祖国的海防。
        中国人民解放军海军  “海上英雄艇”全体指战员
            我们在朝鲜前线八个多月
            一千多次手术都做得很好
            ——李蓝丁同志的信敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    在伟大的中国人民解放军建军二十四周年纪念日即将来临的时候，我谨向您们致以最热烈的和最崇高的敬礼，并祝您们身体健康。
    我们于去年十一月自愿组织了手术队赴朝鲜前线。八个多月来，我们发扬了中国人民解放军的优良的卫生工作传统，在前线医院和志愿军战斗部队中施行了大小一千二百多次手术。由于我们的工作仔细、认真，动手术的结果都很良好，没有发生过一次事故。我们尽量广泛地以静脉全身麻醉代替了吸入全身麻醉。用这种办法使伤员们不但苏醒快，而且苏醒后没有痛苦。伤病员对我们表示很满意，他们见到了我们就感到愉快。我们手术队里各种工作人员之间也很团结。我们并利用了工作空隙，对原在前方的医务工作同志们进行了各种业务教育。但是，对这一切我们决不自满，今后一定还要时刻努力，把工作做得更好。
    毛主席、朱总司令：我和手术队的同志们时刻想念着您们，尤其是在环境紧张、工作困难的时候，只要一想起您们就更有力量。即使是在冰天雪地里也会满身发热。我每当遇到难于处理的问题而又感到自己太年轻、缺乏经验时，想起了你们就有了勇气。毛主席、朱总司令：伤员同志也同样想念着您们。有一个伤员，两手的肌肉已冻死了。那天早上他满怀着希望，看着双手说：“只要毛主席、朱总司令知道就好了，只要毛主席、朱总司令身体健康就好了。”我告诉他，毛主席会知道的，毛主席、朱总司令身体是健康的，他就高兴地笑了。
    我感到光荣的，是我们能够站在保卫祖国、保卫东方和世界和平的前线上。我们每一次手术的完成以及对每一个伤员的诊治或护理，都是对捍卫和平、打击美帝国主义的贡献。虽然环境紧张，工作忙，有的同志因而生病，但是我们的工作效率却一天天在提高，我们的战斗意志也一天比一天更加坚强。我们全体志愿手术队同志一致表示绝不松懈地站在和平战线上，准备随时给予侵略者以严重打击。为了保卫祖国和世界和平，我一定无限忠诚地献身于为伤病员服务的革命事业。		 李蓝丁
