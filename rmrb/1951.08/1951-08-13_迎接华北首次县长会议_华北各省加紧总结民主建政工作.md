To welcome the convocation of the first North China County Magistrate Conference, the People's Governments of all provinces, municipalities, special districts, and counties in the North China region have begun preparatory work. Cadres are now being organized to study relevant documents and instructions on democratic political power construction, and materials on People's Representative Conferences and preferential treatment work are being collected, studied, and organized.

The Hebei Provincial People's Government has issued instructions requiring cadres of local People's Governments to conscientiously study the documents on democratic political power construction stipulated by the North China Affairs Department, review their work in light of reality, and focus on examining the understanding of cadres and people's representatives regarding democratic political construction work. The Provincial People's Government emphasized in its instructions that commissioners and county magistrates should personally summarize the local democratic political power construction work, focusing on studying typical examples. It also stipulated that higher-level governments should assist lower-level governments in carrying out this work, with the province directly assisting one or two counties to thoroughly summarize their experiences. The Pingyuan Provincial People's Government is currently rushing to compile summaries of the conferences of people from all walks of life convened by counties in the province this spring, the conferences of people's representatives from all walks of life in counties exercising the functions of the County People's Congress, and the province's summary of preferential treatment work for the first half of the year. Cadres of People's Governments above the county level in the province are studying documents on democratic political power construction work, examining and summarizing their work. After receiving the notice regarding the convocation of the first North China County Magistrate Conference, the Chahar Provincial People's Government made a decision at its administrative meeting that, in addition to the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs immediately starting to organize materials on democratic political power construction work, it would also send cadres down to investigate and research, and decided to select responsible cadres from Yanggao, Huailai, Xuanhua, Zhangbei, Longguan, Yingxian, and Hunyuan counties to report to the Provincial People's Government on the situation of democratic political construction and preferential treatment work. The Yanbei Special Commissioner's Office of the province has sent the head of the Civil Affairs Section and three others to Shanyin, Shuoxian, and Hunyuan to collect materials on democratic political construction. Wang Shiying, Vice Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, and Zhang Junxuan, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, have separately gone to Linfen, Yuncheng, Changzhi and other places to convey the spirit of convening the first North China County Magistrate Conference and collect materials on democratic political construction.
