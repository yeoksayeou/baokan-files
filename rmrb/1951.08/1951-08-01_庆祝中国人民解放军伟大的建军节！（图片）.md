    Celebrate the great Founding Anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
    August 1st is the 24th anniversary of the glorious and great Chinese People's Liberation Army. After the failure of the Chinese Revolution in 1927 due to the betrayal of the Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to preserve the fruits of the revolution and uphold the Chinese Revolution, the Chinese Communist Party, led primarily by Comrades Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, He Long, and Ye Ting, led more than 30,000 soldiers of the Northern Expedition Army under the Party's influence to launch the Nanchang Uprising on August 1st. This army later joined forces with the troops of the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Comrade Mao Zedong in Jinggang Mountain, and formally established the Fourth Army of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.

    In the autumn of 1927, after the failure of the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan, Chairman Mao led the uprising troops to the Jinggang Mountain area on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi to establish a base. After the troops arrived in Sanwan, they began to reorganize into a regiment. After arriving in the Jinggang Mountain area, they established a revolutionary base and began a new stage of revolutionary struggle.

    The New Fourth Army opened up large anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines both north and south of the Yangtze River, leading the people in the War of Resistance Against Japan. At the end of 1942, the Japanese invaders "swept" the anti-Japanese base area in northern Jiangsu with an army of 100,000, which was completely crushed by our New Fourth Army. This is the scene of the New Fourth Army fighting against the enemy.
    On July 8, 1937, the day after Japanese imperialism launched its war of aggression, the Chinese Communist Party issued its Ten Major Programs for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation, calling on all Chinese people to unite, establish an anti-Japanese national united front, and resolutely resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism. On September 8, 1937, the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army went to the front line of the War of Resistance Against Japan in North China. In the Battle of Pingxingguan, it wiped out more than 3,000 enemy soldiers from the most elite Itagaki Division of the Japanese invaders and destroyed more than 100 enemy vehicles. This victory greatly dealt a blow to the ferocity of the Japanese invaders, stabilized the national war situation, and laid the foundation for the belief that the people of the whole country would win the War of Resistance.

    The Liaoshen Campaign began on September 12, 1948, and ended on November 2. In this campaign, 472,000 bandits of the Kuomintang army were completely annihilated, the entire Northeast was liberated, and the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves in the war underwent a fundamental change, accelerating the victory of the People's Liberation War.
    This is the scene on October 9th when the artillery of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army lined up thousands of cannons, waiting for the signal to launch a general attack, preparing to attack Jinzhou. The Huaihai Campaign began on November 7, 1948, when the Second and Third Field Armies of the People's Liberation Army jointly attacked about 500,000 enemy soldiers from 50 divisions (later increased to 66 divisions) of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army concentrated in the Xuzhou area. This campaign ended completely on January 10, 1949, completely annihilating five elite army corps and fifty-six divisions, totaling 555,000 bandits of Chiang Kai-shek. This enabled the People's Liberation Army to quickly complete preparations for a million-strong army to cross the Yangtze River. The reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, which had bloodily suppressed the Chinese people for 30 years, was thus declared dead.

    On June 25, 1950, the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea and brought the flames of war to the Yalu and Tumen Rivers on the border between China and North Korea, directly and seriously threatening our country's security. Therefore, the Chinese people widely demanded to participate in the Chinese People's Volunteers in a voluntary action to support the Korean people and fight for the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, defending our homes, and defending our country. This is the scene of the Chinese People's Volunteers crossing the Yalu River to rescue the Korean people and pursue the enemy. (Oil painting by Dong Xiwen)
    On January 30, 1949, Beijing was peacefully liberated, and 250,000 Kuomintang troops stationed in the city accepted peaceful reorganization. This is the scene of the citizens warmly welcoming the People's Liberation Army into the city.

    八月一日是光荣伟大的中国人民解放军建军二十四周年纪念。一九二七年中国的大革命因为国民党反动派的叛变而遭受失败以後，中国共产党为了保持革命的胜利果实，坚持中国革命，首先由周恩来、朱德、贺龙、叶挺等同志率领在党影响下的北伐军三万多人，於八月一日在南昌武装起义，这支军队後来和毛泽东同志所领导的秋收起义的队伍，在井冈山会合，正式成立了工农红军第四军。

    一九二七年秋天，湖南秋收起义失败後，毛主席领导起义的队伍，转向湘赣边界的井冈山区域建立根据地。队伍到达三湾後，着手改编为一个团，到达井冈山区建立了革命根据地，开始了革命斗争的新阶段。

    新四军在长江南北敌後开辟了大块抗日根据地，领导人民进行抗日战争。一九四二年底，日寇以十万大军“扫荡”苏北抗日根据地被我新四军彻底粉碎。这是新四军对敌进行战斗的情形。
    一九三七年七月八日，日本帝国主义发动侵略战争的第二天，中国共产党即发表抗战救国十大纲领，号召全中国人民团结起来，建立抗日民族统一战线，坚决抵抗日本帝国主义的侵略。一九三七年九月八路军一一五师开赴华北抗日前线，平型关一战，即消灭了日寇最精锐的板垣师团三千馀人，击毁敌汽车一百馀辆。这一胜利，大大地打击了日寇的凶焰，稳定了全国战局，奠定了全国人民抗战必胜的信念。
    这是平型关大捷时的战场情形。		（油画·金浪、曹思明作）
    辽沈战役开始於一九四八年九月十二日，至十一月二日结束。这次战役全歼国民党匪军四十七万二千馀人，解放了全东北，使得在战争中敌我力量的对比起了根本变化，加速了人民解放战争的胜利。
    这是十月九日人民解放军第四野战军炮兵排列着千百门大炮，等待总攻信号，准备向锦州发动攻击时的情形。淮海战役是在一九四八年十一月七日开始的，人民解放军第二、第三野战军联合向集中徐州地区之蒋匪军在关内的精锐部队五十个师（以後续增为六十六个师）约五十多万人进攻。这次战役於一九四九年一月十日全部结束，全歼蒋匪精锐五个军团，五十六个师五十五万五千多人。使得人民解放军迅速地完成了百万雄师下江南的准备。血腥镇压中国人民达三十年之久的蒋介石反动政府从此宣告灭亡。

    一九五○年六月二十五日美国帝国主义者发动了侵朝战争，并将战火烧向中朝边界的鸭绿江、图们江边，直接严重地威胁我国的安全。因此，中国人民广泛地要求以志愿的行动参加中国人民志愿军支援朝鲜人民，为抗美援朝，保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。这是中国人民志愿军跨过鸭绿江救援朝鲜人民追击敌人的情形。		（油画·董希文作）
    一九四九年一月三十日，北京和平解放，驻在城内的国民党军共二十五万人接受和平改编。这是市民热烈欢迎人民解放军入城的情形。
