　　Era Publishing House Specializes in Publishing Soviet Literature and Art Books and Periodicals
　　The Era Publishing House, which has a glorious history of struggle in the publishing industry, was reorganized into a state-owned enterprise in our country at the end of May. It specializes in publishing literature and art books and periodicals related to the Soviet Union, and will gradually develop into a larger-scale foreign literature and art publishing institution. The "Era" magazine published by the publishing house, in order to adapt to the new direction of the publishing house's business, has decided to change to a translation publication that mainly introduces Soviet literature and art, and also covers the literature and art of new democratic countries and progressive literature and art in Europe and the United States. The magazine has published its final issue on its tenth anniversary (August 20), and will be completely transformed into a literary translation publication, tentatively named "World Literature". The Era Publishing House was established in August 1941, originally operated by Soviet friends, and changed to private operation in our country after the liberation of Shanghai. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, in addition to publishing the "Era" weekly, the publishing house also published the English "Daily War News" and the Chinese "Soviet Literature and Art" and other publications; during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, it published the "Era Daily" and so on. Over the past ten years, the publishing house has waged a tenacious struggle against Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Since its establishment, it has published more than 360 kinds of books, mainly Soviet literature and art works and discussions; followed by the introduction of Soviet political, economic and construction experience, etc. These good foundations will enable it to play a greater role in the publishing industry in the future.
　　"People's Education" Volume 3, Issue 4 Publishes Editorial
　　Emphasizing that the Study of "On Practice" Should Be Combined with Reality
　　"People's Education", in order to launch and strengthen the "On Practice" learning movement among educators across the country, published an editorial in Volume 3, Issue 2, and held an essay contest on "On Practice" in Volume 3, Issue 3. At present, this movement has been responded to by educators across the country. The magazine published an editorial entitled "The Study of 'On Practice' Should Be Closely Integrated with Reality" in Volume 3, Issue 4, published on August 1, further discussing the method of studying "On Practice". The editorial pointed out: "The basic viewpoint of 'On Practice' runs through all of Chairman Mao's works, and also runs through the vivid work he guides. In today's great movements and work led by the People's Government, explanations can be found everywhere. …Therefore, in studying "On Practice", in addition to reading "On Practice" and other works by Chairman Mao and Marxist-Leninist works, we must also contact and participate in the current actual life in many ways." The editorial emphasized the relationship between studying "On Practice" and the current educational construction, explaining that "it is wrong if we only satisfy ourselves with studying books, or satisfy ourselves with doing a little criticism work on paper, without paying attention to the practice of the whole country and the practice of the entire educational construction." The editorial criticized some shortcomings of educators in self-criticism in the past year, such as emptiness… lack of specific analysis, etc. It also pointed out that in the past year, "the criticism work in the education sector has been very insufficient, and the main shortcoming lies in the fact that the criticism is not sufficiently combined with practice, and the firepower is not concentrated on things that are having a real and significant impact on the current education work." The editorial requires that "all those who participate in the study of "On Practice" must earnestly remove the above-mentioned problems in self-criticism and criticism work".

    时代出版社专门出版苏联文艺书刊
    在出版界曾经有过光荣斗争历史的时代出版社，已于五月底改组为我国公营企业，专门出版有关苏联的文艺书刊，并将逐步发展为规模更大的外国文学艺术出版机构。该社出版的《时代》杂志，为了适应该社业务的新的方针，决定改为以介绍苏联文艺为主、旁及新民主主义国家的文艺与欧美进步文艺的翻译刊物。该刊已在它十周年纪念时（八月二十日）出版终刊号，以后完全改变为文艺翻译刊物，暂定名为《世界文学》。时代出版社成立于一九四一年八月，原为苏联友人经营，上海解放后改为我国私人经营。在日本占领上海期间，该社除出版《时代》周刊外，还出版英文《每日战讯》、中文的《苏联文艺》等刊物；国民党反动派统治时期，曾出版《时代日报》等。十年来，该出版社曾对日本帝国主义和国民党反动派进行过顽强的斗争。自它成立以来，共出版书籍三百六十余种，以苏联文学艺术作品和论述为主；其次是介绍苏联政治经济和建设经验等，这些良好的基础，将使它在今后出版事业发挥更大的作用。
  《人民教育》三卷四期发表社论
  强调学习《实践论》要联系实际
    《人民教育》为在全国教育工作者中展开与加强《实践论》学习运动，曾在三卷二期上发表社论，并在三卷三期上举办关于《实践论》的征文。目前这个运动已得到全国教育工作者的响应。该杂志特在八月一日出版的三卷四期上发表题为“学习《实践论》要密切联系实际”的社论，进一步论述了学习《实践论》的方法。社论指出：“《实践论》的基本观点是贯串于毛主席的一切著作中，也贯串在他所指导的活生生的工作中，在今天人民政府所领导的各项伟大运动和工作中，到处都可找到说明。……所以学习《实践论》，除阅读《实践论》及毛主席的其他著作，马列主义的著作外，也要多方面接触和参加当前实际的生活。”社论强调学习《实践论》与当前教育建设的关系，说明“如果只满足于学习书本，或满足于做一点纸上的批评工作，而不注意整个的国家的实践，整个教育建设的实践，那是错误的。”社论批评了一年来教育工作者在自我批评上的某些缺点，例如空洞……缺乏具体分析等等。又指出一年来“教育界的批评工作是做得十分不够的，其主要的缺点是在于批评和实际结合不够，没有集中火力于对当前教育工作正起着实际重大影响的东西。”社论要求“一切参加《实践论》学习的人，在自我批评和批评工作中，切实去掉以上所举的那些毛病”。
