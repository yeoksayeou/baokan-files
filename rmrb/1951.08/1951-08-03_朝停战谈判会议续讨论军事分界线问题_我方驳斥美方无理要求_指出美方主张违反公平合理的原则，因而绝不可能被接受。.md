Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd—This reporter has learned from the headquarters on the Korean front that the seventeenth meeting of the Korean armistice talks was held on August 2nd at 10:00 AM (Korean time) and ended at 11:20 AM. On the issue of determining the military demarcation line for the establishment of a demilitarized zone, a significant gap remains between the opinions of the two sides. General Nam Il, the chief representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, repeatedly stated that any attempt to oppose the fair and reasonable proposal of using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, by boasting about the effectiveness of naval and air force bombing and emphasizing the need to establish a so-called military defense line, and attempting to push the military demarcation line deep into our positions, is inconsistent with the military realities on the Korean battlefield, violates the principles of fairness and reasonableness, and is not conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and therefore can never be accepted.

The eighteenth meeting is scheduled to be held on August 3rd at 10:00 AM.

　　朝停战谈判会议续讨论军事分界线问题
    我方驳斥美方无理要求
    指出美方主张违反公平合理的原则，因而绝不可能被接受。
    【新华社平壤二日电】本社记者自朝鲜前线总部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议第十七次会议在八月二日上午十时（朝鲜时间）举行，十一时二十分结束。在确定双方军事分界线以建立非军事区的问题上，双方的意见之间，依然存在着极大的距离。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军，反复说明，任何夸耀海、空军狂轰乱炸的效能，强调建立所谓军事防御线的必要，以反对将三八线作为双方军事分界线的公平合理的方案，而企图将军事分界线深入我方阵地的要求，都是不合乎朝鲜战场上的军事实际，违反了公平合理的原则，不利于朝鲜问题的和平解决，因而是绝不可能被接受的。
    第十八次会议定于八月三日上午十时举行。
