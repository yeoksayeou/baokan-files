    A Family Letter
    By Liang Yulong
    (4) At the market square of Liujie Township, big red posters of good news are pasted, and the house is filled with gifts from various organizations. This is the greatest happy event that our ancestors for three generations have never experienced! Son, you must not forget the people's love for us!
     (5) The winter before last, the People's Liberation Army came to our township and helped us reduce rent and overthrow the local bullies. Now, land will be distributed soon. Our village has already established a Farmers' Association and a People's Armed Self-Defense Force. Your three older brothers are all members of the Farmers' Association. Your eldest sister-in-law is also the leader of the women's group!
    (6) Our entire village has calculated the fruits of victory from the landlords' hands as two hundred and ninety-two *shi* of rice. The bastard landlords Liu Shijie, Tian Maoqing, and Zhou Guangtai, who used to oppress us, have all been shot.

    一封家信

    （四）柳街乡的场口，贴着大红喜报，家里摆满了各机关送来的礼物。这是我们祖宗三代从来没有过的大喜事！娃娃，你切不能忘了人民对我们的爱护啊！
     （五）前年冬天，解放军来到我们乡上，帮助我们减了租，斗垮了恶霸。现在跟着就要分田了。我们村里已经成立起农民协会和人民武装自卫队。你三个哥哥都是农民协会会员。你大嫂还是妇女小组长咧！
    （六）我们全村从地主手里算回胜利果实二百九十二石大米，过去欺压过我们的恶霸地主刘士杰、田茂清、周光泰这些龟儿子都被枪毙了。
