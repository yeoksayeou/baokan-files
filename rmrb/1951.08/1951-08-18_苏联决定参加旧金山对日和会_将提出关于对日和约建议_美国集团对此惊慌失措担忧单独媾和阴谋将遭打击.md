Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: TASS Moscow, August 17th: On July 20th of this year, American Ambassador to Moscow, Kirk, and British Ambassador Kelly delivered a note to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, inviting the Soviet government to participate in the peace treaty conference on Japan to be convened by the American government in San Francisco on September 4th of this year. The ambassadors also presented a draft peace treaty with Japan on behalf of the governments of the United States and Great Britain.

On August 12th, the Soviet government notified the US government that it would send a delegation to the San Francisco conference and would submit the Soviet government's proposals for a peace treaty with Japan.

The Soviet government also announced the list of Soviet representatives to the conference: Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko (head of the delegation), Soviet Ambassador to the United States Panyushkin, Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Zarubin, and member of the special committee of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Golunsky.

Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: The Soviet Union's decision to participate in the San Francisco Peace Conference on Japan has caused panic in the United States and its satellite countries. They are extremely worried that the Soviet Union's participation in the conference will severely strike the US-manipulated plot to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan.

According to an AFP report from Washington, the United States "expressed surprise" at the Soviet Union's decision to participate in the San Francisco conference, and "commotion" broke out in Washington. Although the United States outwardly invited the Soviet Union to participate in the conference, in reality, its heart was "no longer expecting the Soviet Union to accept the invitation to attend the San Francisco conference at this time." The United States is worried that the Soviet Union's participation in the conference may "disintegrate this set of machinery painstakingly pieced together by Dulles (referring to the San Francisco conference manipulated by the United States)."

Great Britain and France, which followed the US policy of a separate peace with Japan, also showed the same panicked emotions as their American master. According to AFP, British political figures "expressed fear" about the Soviet Union's decision to participate in the San Francisco conference, and they are worried that this step by the Soviet Union will strike the imperialist bloc's plan to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and will promote the world people's peace movement. The French political circles were "excited" by the Soviet Union's decision, and they are worried that the Soviet Union's action "may at least delay the progress of American world policy," especially the implementation of the plan to revive Japanese militarism.

The Yoshida reactionary government of Japan, which colluded with the United States, was especially panicked. According to an AFP dispatch from Tokyo on the 14th, the news of the Soviet Union's announcement of its participation in the San Francisco conference "surprised and disturbed Japanese officials." "Japanese government officials" feared that the Soviet Union would propose a draft treaty that would benefit the Japanese people, thus putting the Yoshida government "in a difficult position." Because "the provisions on territory and military bases in the US draft are extremely unpopular in Japan," and the Japanese people suspect that the US-made peace treaty with Japan, which is to be signed in San Francisco, is "really a peace treaty."

The panic-stricken US government is attempting to use despicable means to limit the Soviet Union's right to speak at the San Francisco conference, attempting to obstruct the Soviet Union's efforts to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. Truman's representative Dulles announced arrogantly and unreasonably at a press conference on the 15th that the US-made draft treaty was an "absolutely final draft," and "the countries participating in the San Francisco conference must not change it," and they were invited only "to sign the draft treaty." This foreshadows that the United States will do its best to obstruct the Soviet Union and other countries from putting forward fair and reasonable proposals on the peace treaty with Japan at the San Francisco conference.

However, the US and British imperialists cannot help but have some doubts about the effectiveness of their conspiracy on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. They are very worried that if the United States insists on its current domineering attitude, the Soviet Union and Asian countries will refuse to sign the US-made draft treaty. The French Foreign Ministry-affiliated newspaper Le Monde worried on the 14th: "The fact that China, the main enemy of Japan, is not participating in the conference is already worrying about the future. If other Asian countries also refuse to participate in the signing, then one would have to conclude that a treaty concerning Far Eastern countries and especially concerning various issues in the Far East region is only attended by countries from other continents (such as the United States, Australia, Britain, France, etc.)."

### 苏联决定参加旧金山对日和会  将提出关于对日和约建议  美国集团对此惊慌失措担忧单独媾和阴谋将遭打击

　　苏联决定参加旧金山对日和会
    将提出关于对日和约建议       
    美国集团对此惊慌失措担忧单独媾和阴谋将遭打击
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：今年七月二十日，美国驻莫斯科大使寇克与英国大使凯莱以照会一件递交苏联外交部，邀请苏联政府参加美国政府将于今年九月四日在旧金山召开的对日和约会议。该大使等并代表美、英两国政府提出对日和约草案。
    八月十二日，苏联政府通知美国政府说：它将派遣代表团参加旧金山会议，并将提出苏联政府关于对日和约的建议。
    苏联政府并宣布苏联参加和会的代表名单如下：苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯（代表团团长）、苏联驻美大使潘友新、苏联驻英大使查鲁宾、苏联外交部专门委员会委员戈伦斯基。
    【新华社十七日讯】苏联决定参加旧金山对日和约会议的措施，在美国及其仆从国家中引起了一片惊慌。它们极其担心苏联参加会议，将严重地打击美国操纵缔结单独对日和约的阴谋计划。
    据法新社华盛顿消息透露，美国对苏联决定参加旧金山会议“表示惊奇”，华盛顿发生“骚动”。美国当初虽然表面上邀请苏联参加会议，而实际上其内心是“不再期望苏联在此刻接受出席旧金山会议的邀请”。美国担心：苏联参加会议，可能“使杜勒斯苦心拼凑好的这一套机器（按指美国摆布的旧金山会议）分崩离析”。
    追随美国单独对日媾和政策的英法两国，也表现出与其美国主子相同的惊惶情绪。据法新社透露，英国政界人士对苏联决定参加旧金山会议“表示恐惧”，他们担忧苏联这一步骤将打击帝国主义集团缔结对日单独和约的计划，并将推进世界人民的和平运动。法国政界则因苏联的决定“引起了激动”，他们担忧苏联这一行动“至少可能是延误美国世界政策的进展”，特别是复活日本军国主义计划的实行。
    与美国狼狈为奸的日本吉田反动政府，尤其是惊慌失措。据法新社东京十四日电透露，苏联宣布参加旧金山会议的消息，“使日本官方感到惊讶不安”。“日本政府人士”恐惧：苏联将提出一个有利于日本人民的和约草案，从而使吉田政府“处在一个困难的地位”。因为，“美国草案中关于领土和军事基地的条款在日本国内极不得人心”，日本人民怀疑准备在旧金山签订的美制对日和约究竟“是否是和约”。
    惶恐不安的美国政府，正企图以卑劣的手段限制苏联在旧金山会议中的发言权，妄图阻挠苏联为缔结全面对日和约的努力。杜鲁门的代表杜勒斯于十五日在招待记者会上横蛮无理地宣布：美制和约草案是“绝对的草约定案”，“参加旧金山会议的国家不得予以更改”，它们之被邀请，仅是“要它们在草约上签字”。这预示：美国将竭力阻挠苏联及其他国家在旧金山会议上提出公正的、合理的关于对日和约的建议。
    但是，美英帝国主义者对于它们在对日和约问题上的这种奸计的效果如何，已不能不有所怀疑。它们非常担心：如果美国坚持其目前的专横态度，苏联和亚洲各国将拒绝在美制的和约草案上签字。接近法国外交部的报纸世界报十四日忧虑地说：“作为日本主要敌方的中国不参加和会的事，已经叫人为前途担忧了。如果亚洲其他国家也拒绝参加签约，那就叫人得出这样一种说法，即一项关于远东国家而且特别是关于远东地区各项问题的条约，却仅有其他大陆的国家（如美、澳、英、法等）参加了。”
