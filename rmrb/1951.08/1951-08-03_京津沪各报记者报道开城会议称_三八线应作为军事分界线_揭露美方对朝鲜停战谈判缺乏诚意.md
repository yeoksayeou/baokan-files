    Three-Eighth Line Should Be the Military Demarcation Line
    Exposing the Lack of Sincerity of the U.S. Side in the Korean Armistice Negotiations
    【Xinhua News Agency, 2nd】According to a report from Kaesong, Korea, by Tianjin Progressive Daily reporter Pan Jingyuan on July 31st: The Korean armistice negotiations are still centered on the issue of the military demarcation line. At the same time, U.S. imperialism is mobilizing "public opinion" outside the meeting, with senators, newspapers, and broadcasters clamoring to set the demarcation line at the Korean waistline from Pyongyang to Wonsan, and "people" marching in Seoul clamoring to set the demarcation line at the Yalu River. In this狂妄 propaganda, U.S. imperialism is obviously attempting to抹煞 the fact that the war in the past seven months of this year has often been conducted north and south of the 38th parallel, and that the western front is still south of the 38th parallel and the eastern front is north of the 38th parallel. At the same time, the enemy is strengthening naval and air force activities and increasing troop strength during the armistice negotiations. For example, a United Press dispatch on July 25th reported the news that a large number of enemy tanks, vehicles, and troops were advancing north along the highway. Even most of the foreign journalists believe that a ceasefire at the 38th parallel is reasonable. A Canadian journalist said: The British and Canadians all believe that the demarcation line should be on the 38th parallel, and north of the 38th parallel is unreasonable.
    【Xinhua News Agency, 2nd】According to a report from Kaesong, Korea, by Beijing Guangming Daily reporter Sun Chengpei on July 29th: The issue of the military demarcation line has been discussed continuously for four times from the 26th to the 29th, but no result has been achieved due to the U.S. side's unreasonable refusal to use the 38th parallel as the demarcation line. Since the beginning of the negotiations, the U.S. side has not shown its sincerity with facts, while our side has fully demonstrated its sincerity in striving for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue on the Kaesong neutral zone and the agenda issue. At the same time, Van Fleet (Note: Commander of the Eighth U.S. Army invading Korea) repeatedly emphasized that he is unwilling to stop military operations before an agreement is reached. Enemy planes fly over Kaesong every day, and the sound of shelling by U.S. and Rhee troops can be heard clearly. However, when reporters talked with U.S. soldiers outside the meeting room, they all expressed their willingness to return home after an early ceasefire, and pointed out that bombing only destroys and massacres innocent civilians and has no decisive effect on the military. None of the U.S. soldiers who talked to reporters opposed a ceasefire on the 38th parallel.
    【Xinhua News Agency, 2nd】According to a report from Kaesong, Korea, by Shanghai Ta Kung Pao special correspondent Zhu Qiping on July 28th: After the resumption of the Korean armistice negotiations on July 25th, the meeting continued on the 26th and the agenda was adopted. At this point, the initial stage of the meeting can be said to have come to an end. The discussion will now touch on substantive issues. The first issue to be discussed is the military demarcation line and the establishment of a demilitarized zone. The U.S. side seems to be inclined to forcibly occupy its current positions, which is extremely unreasonable. Because the basis for the Kaesong negotiations is the proposal by the U.S. side to our side for a meeting based on Malik's speech, and with our consent. Malik's speech clearly stated that both sides should withdraw their troops a little from the "38th parallel." If the U.S. side wants to forcibly occupy the area north of the "38th parallel," it is obviously a violation of the starting point of the negotiations and shows no sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean War, which will inevitably be unanimously opposed by peace-loving people all over the world. During the negotiations, the Chinese and North Korean representatives repeatedly expressed their sincerity for peace, but the success or failure of future meetings depends entirely on whether the other side has sincerity.

    三八线应作为军事分界线
    揭露美方对朝鲜停战谈判缺乏诚意
    【新华社二日讯】据天津进步日报记者潘静远七月三十一日自朝鲜开城报道：朝鲜停战谈判仍旧围绕着军事分界线问题进行。美帝国主义同时在会外动员“民意”，由参议员、报纸、广播员叫嚣将分界线设在平壤到元山一线的朝鲜蜂腰部，并由汉城游行的“民众”叫嚣把分界线设在鸭绿江。在这种狂妄的宣传中，美帝国主义显然企图抹煞今年七个月战争经常在三八线南北进行，并且现在仍然是西线在三八线在南、东线在三八线以北进行的事实。同时敌人在停战谈判时正在加强海空军活动和增加兵力。例如合众社七月二十五日电就报道了敌人的大量坦克、汽车和部队沿公路北进的消息。即使是对方大部分新闻记者，也认为三八线停战是合理的。一个加拿大记者说：英国人和加拿大人都认为分界线应在三八线上，在三八线以北是不合理的。
    【新华社二日讯】据北京光明日报记者孙承佩七月二十九日自朝鲜开城报道：军事分界线问题自二十六日迄二十九日已连续讨论四次，因美方无理地拒绝以三八线为分界线，仍无结果。自谈判开始以来，美方尚未以事实表现其诚意，而我方则已在开城中立区及议程问题上充分表现争取和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意。与此同时，范佛利特（按：侵朝美军第八军军长）反复强调，在协议达成之前，不愿停止军事行动。开城上空每日有敌机飞过，美李军窜扰的炮声清晰可闻。但记者在会议室外与美军士兵交谈时，他们都愿意早日停战回国，并指出轰炸只是破坏和屠杀无辜平民，对军事并无决定作用。与记者交谈的美军士兵，没有一个人反对在三八线上停战。
    【新华社二日讯】据上海大公报特派记者朱启平七月二十八日自朝鲜开城报道：朝鲜停战谈判会议七月二十五日续开后，二十六日继续举行，通过议程，会议至此，初步阶段可谓告一段落。今后讨论即接触实质问题。首先要讨论的是军事分界线、建立非军事区域问题。美方似倾向于强占目前所据阵地，这是极端不合理的。因为开城谈判的基础是美方由于马立克讲演的建议，向我方提议举行会议，而经我方同意的。马立克的讲演中，既明白提出双方军队自“三八线”撤退一点，美方如欲强占“三八线”以北地域，显然是违反了谈判的出发基础，对和平解决朝鲜战争毫无诚意，必遭全世界爱好和平人民的一致反对。谈判中，中朝代表一再表示和平诚意，但今后会议的成败，全看对方有无诚意。
