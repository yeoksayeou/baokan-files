    Reply Regarding the Question of "China's World Firsts"
    Editor,
    We are very grateful for reading Comrade Tu Kang's article "Critique of China's World Firsts" published in your newspaper on July 29th. This small column has also received attention from your newspaper before. Our purpose in publishing "China's World Firsts" is to promote the spirit of patriotism; the motive is here, and the purpose of the publicity is also here. Initially, there were not many topics in mind. After publishing several topics, it aroused great attention from readers. They used "China's World Firsts" as discussion material and inspired many scholars and experts to contribute to our newspaper. So far, we have received 2,765 articles in this regard. Without this encouragement and support, we would not be able to continue publishing it. However, we did not do this work well. Comrade Tu Kang's criticism is completely correct. Although we have done our best to consult experts and carefully review the manuscripts, our knowledge is limited after all, and we are not up to the task, and shortcomings are exposed everywhere. First of all, is the name problem. The standard we selected for "World First" is measured by China's largest, earliest, most, best, or unique. Because the standard is too broad, many things can be included in the topic, and some "firsts" cannot be highlighted significantly. On the other hand, great historical figures and events are limited by the "first," making it difficult to compare and include them. We are aware of these problems and have decided on the following solutions: (1) We plan to end this column in the near future after publishing the more important subjects. (2) We will use what has already been published in the newspaper as a draft, solicit everyone's opinions, and ask experts for advice. We plan to remove the inappropriate parts, and after final evaluation and revision, we will publish a book titled "China's World Firsts."
    Due to Comrade Tu Kang's criticism, we would like to inform your newspaper of our handling of this issue, and at the same time, we hope to solicit the opinions of the majority of readers through your newspaper to determine what is acceptable and what is not. As for the wording and content, we are also willing to accept criticism and make corrections one by one in the final publication.
    We are also paying attention to the modern and political materials mentioned by Comrade Tu Kang. Some are being prepared, and some, such as the 25,000-li Long March and the peasant revolution, have already been published. Attached for your information.
                                                Ta Kung Pao Editorial Department

### 大公报编辑部  关于“中国的世界第一”问题的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　大公报编辑部
    关于“中国的世界第一”问题的答复
    编辑同志：
    读了你报七月二十九日所载屠康同志评“中国的世界第一”一文，我们很感激。这个小专栏，以前也曾受到你报的注意。我们登载“中国的世界第一”，目的是为了发扬爱国主义精神；动机在此，宣传的目的也在此。最初想到的题目不多，刊出若干题以后，引起读者极大注意，他们纷纷以“中国的世界第一”为谈论资料；同时激发了许多学者专家，为本报撰稿。到现在为止，我们共收到这方面的稿件达二千七百六十五篇。没有这些鼓励和支持，我们不可能继续刊载下去。不过我们对这工作没有做好。屠康同志的批评完全正确。虽然我们曾尽了努力，向专家请教，认真审阅稿件，但毕竟我们的知识有限，力不从心，缺点处处暴露。首先是名称问题，我们所选的“世界第一”标准，是以中国最大、最先、最多、最好或独有为衡量。因为标准太过广泛，众多事物可以入题，有些“第一”就不能显著突出了。另方面，历史上伟大的人物与事件，又为“第一”所限，无从比较，难于列进去。我们知道这些毛病，并已决定改正的办法：（一）准备在最近期内将比较重要的题材登出后，就结束这个专栏。（二）将已在报上登载的作为初稿，征求大家的意见，请专家指教，打算剔去不合适的部分，经过最后评定修正，再行出版一册“中国的世界第一”。
    由于屠康同志的批评，我们愿将对于这个问题的处理情况告诉你报，同时希望通过你报征求广大读者的意见，决定那些要得，那些要不得。至于文字、内容方面，我们也愿意接受批评，在最后出版时一一加以改正。
    屠康同志所提关于现代的和政治方面的材料，我们也在注意，有些正在准备中，有些如二万五千里长征和农民革命，已经登出了。附告。
                                                大公报编辑部
