Clear up materials, verify funds, oppose waste!
　　Many units have a local perspective that undervalues materials work.
    Serious waste of materials in the national railway system.
    Materials departments and production departments should closely integrate to strengthen the overall concept.
    There is extremely serious waste in the national railway system in the use of materials. This phenomenon is clearly a stumbling block to the implementation of economic accounting in the People's Railways. Last year, the task of supplying materials to the railway system was basically completed under a "stopgap" situation. The plans of some production departments were not only not timely, but also frequently changed because they were sometimes incorrect. The material supply departments were irresponsibly "responsive to every request" from the production departments, fearing to bear the responsibility for "work stoppage due to lack of materials." Therefore, the material application forms submitted by the production departments were not carefully reviewed. The material application forms for production and maintenance this year have not yet been fully submitted. This makes it impossible to prepare a national supply plan. The production departments submit material application forms sporadically, and the supply departments have to supply materials at any time. Although the national railway inventory of materials was checked last year, the understanding of the specifications, uses, and expiration dates of the materials is still vague. The inventory material report is shelved and has become a thing of the past. Deployment work cannot be carried out in depth. For example, the Beitongpu Railway urgently needs steel rails, but the production units of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau have accumulated more than 12,000, and no one knows about it. This situation completely destroys the planning and initiative of material supply work. The current requirement for material supply departments to implement economic accounting is to supply materials more accurately. If the supply plan cannot be established, economic accounting will also fail.

            Inconsistent material consumption quotas, large differences between units
    Standardization of material specifications and reasonable material consumption quotas are prerequisites for doing a good job in material supply. Up to now, the material specifications used by various railway bureaus are extremely inconsistent, with a wide variety of sizes and patterns. For example, the cold-cast wheel blueprint design submitted by the locomotive department was not up to specifications. After the material department handed it over to the Shanghai Cold-Cast Wheel Factory, the dimensions were repeatedly changed. The wheels accepted by the locomotive department were allocated to the Shanghai Railway Bureau, but the bureau considered them to be unsatisfactory and refused to use them. The difference in material consumption quotas between units is very surprising. For example, the Tangshan Railway Factory used 900 kilograms of copper blocks and 100 kilograms of tin blocks for overhauling a 夂Т locomotive; while the Changxindian Railway Factory only used 400 kilograms of copper blocks and 60 kilograms of tin blocks. The Tangshan Railway Factory used 217 kilograms of raw iron for rebuilding each棚车, while the Sifang Railway Factory only used 16 kilograms, a difference of as much as 14 times. The relevant authorities have not paid enough attention to this chaotic phenomenon, and have failed to study and formulate more practical and unified quotas based on the actual situation on the spot, thus making it impossible for the material supply department to start when preparing the supply plan.

            The national railway backlog of materials is as much as one-half of this year's material supply task.
    Increasing the turnover rate of materials and saving working capital are the goals of material supply workers. However, according to statistics, in 1950, the materials that were frequently backlogged in the supply factory warehouses in the national railways accounted for more than one-half of this year's material supply task. And two-fifths of these stocks are obsolete materials. Some of these obsolete materials were left over from the Japanese puppet and Kuomintang periods and have not been processed until now; some are so-called "new obsolete materials."
    The main reasons for the emergence of new obsolete materials are, first, demanding more materials without asking for actual needs, or even demanding what is not needed, resulting in "preparing more and using less" or "preparing but not using." Another situation is "supplying what is not needed" or "supplying what is not suitable," forming "preparing but not using." The Changxindian Railway Factory wanted eight tons of spring steel in the first and second quarters of this year, but reduced it to six tons after the annual material application was submitted. The factory received 237 tons of steel ingots, which were not used at all, and requested to return them. The Baonan Bridge project of the Tianjin Railway Bureau required more than 14,000 bags of cement, but only more than 2,000 bags were actually used. The original budget for the pile wood used in the Eighteen Datai Ditch project of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau was 900, but the bureau actually demanded 1,900, and actually used 300. The bureau also received dozens of tons of steel bars, but did not use one ton. After the project was completed, the bureau returned more than 40 carloads of materials.
    Secondly, the supply system ideology of the personnel in the supply department has not been eliminated, and the idea of completing more supply tasks with less money has not been established. Therefore, when there is money, they buy materials, but they do not ask whether these materials are actually needed. Therefore, they purchase every month when there is money, leaving useful funds dead in the material warehouse. In the third quarter of last year, the Jinan Materials Office purchased a large amount of materials and stored them without using them.
    Some are that the material supply is out of sync with the project progress. When the materials are delivered, the project has been completed, so these materials have become obsolete. For example, more than 1,600 lead wire porcelain tubes and 283 iron tubes stored in the Shanghai Materials Factory were originally prepared for the construction of the Shanghai Building of the bureau. Because the delivery was slightly late, they were not used. In addition, in commonly used materials, the varieties are extremely unbalanced. For example, square iron and cast steel fittings can be used for five or six years, while some major materials are not enough for one month. These phenomena fully illustrate the serious situation of material fund backlog and waste.
    In addition, some material backlogs are due to the conservative thinking of some technical personnel, or they prefer to use foreign goods. For example, the cutting allowance of the casting waste material of a certain factory is more than one-third of the weight of the finished product on average due to the use of ancient models. Because the blanks of the Shanghai Qishuyan Railway Factory were too large, more than 50 tons of copper powder were accumulated, and it is still increasing. They have not been utilized until now, and the goods are discarded on the ground and allowed to oxidize and dissipate. The Shanghai Railway Bureau has a large number of old files stored and not used, and bought a large number of foreign-made new files.

            Serious corruption in the material supply department
    Corruption in the material supply department is also very serious. Li Ronghai, a driver of the Tianjin Materials Factory, stole and sold 24.5 gallons of gasoline, and the Tianjin Railway Bureau Materials Factory collectively embezzled, and were all expelled. Zhu Junming, a purchasing agent of the Zhengzhou Materials Office stationed in Shanghai, accepted bribes from merchants. Shao Yuanheng, of the Materials Section of the Hangzhou Railway Sub-bureau, embezzled 6 million yuan for purchasing 5,000 horizontal bracing timbers. Wang Yiqin, deputy director of the Jinan Railway Bureau, embezzled and accepted bribes of 9 million yuan, and Zhang Zhongxiu, director of the department, and five others accepted bribes of 8.2 million yuan from merchants. They have all been punished according to the severity of the circumstances and sent to the court for legal handling. In addition, there are also five or six more serious cases of corruption by purchasing personnel in the production department. This legacy of the old society directly damages the interests of the people's country and must not be allowed to continue to happen.

            Some leading cadres do not pay attention to materials work
    Everyone does not pay attention to materials work. The Shanghai Railway Bureau built an office building, and the Qishuyan Railway Factory built an auditorium that can accommodate more than 4,000 people, while allowing iron plates and iron pipes to be piled in the open, exposed to the sun and rain, and rusted. Some material cadres have a wrong understanding of material supply work; they say: "Materials work is clerical work." Some say: "Materials work is serving people." They are not interested in materials work. In order to do a good job in material supply, it is necessary to require that the importance of materials and material supply work be recognized from the leadership, strengthen the political education of material workers, care about their work, and conduct timely inspections. This is the ideological understanding problem that needs to be solved first.

            Some units lack an overall concept
    It is necessary to establish an overall concept in the use of materials. Some production units believe that the quality of domestic carbon rods and iron sandpaper is low and the cost is high, which does not meet the requirements of economic accounting, but they do not know that only by promoting the use of domestic goods can the output of domestic goods be increased and the quality improved. Under this noble spirit of patriotism, what does it matter if the production cost of a small unit is temporarily affected (in fact, it is not always the case)? Some factories are unwilling to manufacture parts themselves, because they think that the parts are too fragmented, thankless, and it is easier to show achievements and get factory reward funds by repairing large things. Some units require that the surplus materials be transported away quickly after the funds are verified, and are unwilling to manage them on behalf of others, because they think that management is troublesome and occupies the warehouse in vain; but they do not know that the national universal fund verification and a large number of surplus materials are handed over to the central government. If the original management units are unwilling to use the original warehouses to manage them on behalf of the government, then the government will have to invest a lot of money to build centralized warehouses. This will waste manpower and financial resources. Now the government is calling for verifying funds and implementing economic accounting. If the understanding of the overall concept is not clear, it will inevitably damage the interests of the people's country.

            Direction of efforts in the future
    In the future, material workers must solve the following problems in their thinking in order to do a good job in material work.
    First of all, we must strictly implement the system: The implementation of our new management methods for material work requires all material personnel to eliminate departmentalism and establish a high degree of overall concept. Without this overall concept, our material work will encounter great difficulties.
    Secondly, the material department should closely integrate with the production department. The first step requirement for doing a good job in material supply is to master advanced consumption quotas and material standardization. To achieve this requirement, we must obtain the full understanding and strong assistance of the production department, and rely on the efforts of the production department. That is to say, the production department and the material supply department are closely related and share weal and woe. Only under close cooperation and mutual supervision can we improve supply efficiency and complete production tasks.
    Third, make full use of obsolete materials and waste materials, and try to avoid the occurrence of new obsolete materials. Therefore, attaching importance to the utilization of obsolete materials and waste materials is a political task, establishing the idea of utilizing obsolete materials and waste materials, and establishing reward methods for utilizing obsolete materials and waste materials, in order to stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of workers in utilizing obsolete materials and waste materials.

    清理资材，核定资金，反对浪费！
　　许多单位存在局部观点轻视材料工作
    全国铁路材料浪费现象严重
    材料部门和生产部门应密切结合加强整体观念
    全国铁路系统在运用材料方面有着极其严重的浪费现象。这种现象显然是人民铁路推行经济核算制的绊脚石。去年铁路系统供应材料的任务，基本上是在一种“水来土掩”的状况之下完成的。有的生产部门的计划不仅不及时，而且因为有时不正确而时常变更。材料供应部门对于生产部门的要求是不负责任的“有求必应”，唯恐担负起“停工待料”的责任。因此对生产部门提出的用料申请书，未作精细的审核。今年生产维修用料申请书，到现在还没有完全提出。这样就使得全国供应计划无法编制。生产部门零零星星地提出用料申请书，供应部门只好随时供应材料。去年虽然清点了全国铁路库存材料，但对于材料的规格、用途和使用期限的了解仍然是模糊的。库存材料的报告束置高阁，成了明日黄花。调配工作也不能深入展开。例如北同蒲线急需钢轨，而郑州铁路局各生产单位却积压了一万二千多根，没有人知道。这种情况整个地破坏了材料供应工作的计划性和主动性。现在要求材料供应部门实行经济核算制，是为了更精确地供应材料。如果供应计划不能确立，经济核算也就会落空。
            材料消费定额不一，各单位间相差很大
    材料规格的标准化和合理的材料消费定额，是做好材料供应工作的先决条件。到目前为止，各铁路局用料规格极不一致，尺寸花样繁多。例如机务主管部门提出的冷铸车轮蓝图设计不合规格，由材料部门交给上海冷铸车轮厂以后，一再变更尺寸。机务主管部门验收的车轮，拨给上海铁路局，该局认为不合要求，拒不使用。各单位材料消费定额的相差是非常惊人的。例如唐山铁路工厂大修夂Т机车一台，用铜块九百公斤，锡块一百公斤；而长辛店铁路工厂仅用铜块四百公斤，锡块六十公斤。唐山铁路工厂重造棚车，每辆用元铁二百一十七公斤，四方铁路工厂只用十六公斤，相差竟达十四倍之多。对于这种混乱现象，有关主管部门不够注意，未能根据现场实际情况，加以研究做出比较实用统一定额，因而使得材料供应部门在编制供应计划时，无法下手。
            全国铁路积压材料竟达今年材料供应任务的二分之一
    提高材料周转速度，节省流动资金，是材料供应工作者的努力目标。但据统计，一九五○年全国铁路经常积压在供应厂库内的存料，竟达今年材料供应任务的二分之一以上。而在这些存料中有二分之一为呆废料，这些呆料一部分是日伪和国民党时期所遗留的至今没有处理；一部分是所谓“新呆料”。
    产生新呆料的主要原因，第一是多要材料，而不问实际需要，甚至所要非所需，结果变成了“备多用少”或“备而不用”。另外还有一种情况是“供非所需”或“供不合需”形成“备而无用”。长辛店铁路工厂在今年第一、二季，要元弹簧钢八吨，但至全年用料申请书提出后，却减为六吨。该厂领了钢锭二百三十七吨，完全没有用，又要求退出。天津铁路局的保南桥工程，要洋灰一万四千余袋，但实用只二千余袋。张家口铁路分局十八台大沟工程所用桩木的原预算为九百根，但该局却实要了一千九百根，实用三百根。该局还领了几十吨钢筋，没有用一吨。该局工程结束后，退料四十余车。
    其次是供应部门人员的供给制思想没有铲除，以很少钱完成更多的供应任务的思想没有树立，因而有了钱，就买材料，却不问这些材料究竟是否需要。因而每月有钱，每月进行采购，把有用的资金都搁死在材料仓库里。去年第三季度济南材料处就购了大批材料，存着不用。
    有些是材料供应与工程进度脱节。材料运到时，工程却已完成，因而这些材料成了呆料。如上海材料厂积存的引线瓷管一千六百余根，铁管二八三根原来是准备作为修建该局上海大楼用的。因交货稍迟，没有被用上。此外，在常用料里面，品种极不平衡。如方铁和铸钢配件，可敷用五六年，而有些主要材料却不敷一个月之用。这些现象充分地说明了材料资金积压和浪费的严重情况。
    此外，还有些材料的积压是某些技术人员有守旧思想，或喜欢用外国货，如某厂铸件荒料由于运用古老模型的结果，其切削留量平均达成品重量的三分之一以上。上海戚墅堰铁路工厂因毛坯太大，积存铜末五十余吨，还不断增加，至今未能利用，货弃于地任之氧化散失。上海铁路局存有大批旧锉不用，买了大批外国制的新锉。
            材料供应部门贪污现象严重
    在材料供应部门的贪污腐化行为也是很严重的。天津材料厂司机李荣海等盗卖汽油二四点五加仑，天津铁路局材料厂集体贪污，均受开除处分。郑州材料处驻沪采购员朱俊明接受商人贿赂。杭州铁路分局材料科邵元衡采购横担木五千根贪污六百万元。济南铁路局副处长王益钦贪污受贿九百万元，主任课员张锺秀等五人接受商人贿赂八百二十万元，均已依情节轻重分别惩处，并送交法院法办。此外生产部门采购人员的贪污案较严重的也有五、六起。这种旧社会的遗毒，直接损害了人民国家的利益，是决不容许继续发生的。
            有些领导干部不重视材料工作
    大家对于材料工作是不重视的，上海铁路局修建办公大楼，戚墅堰铁路工厂盖了一个容纳四千多人的大礼堂，而让铁板铁管露天堆置，日晒夜露，长了铁锈，有些材料干部对材料供应工作还有一种错误的认识；他们说：“材料工作是事务工作。”有的说：“材料工作是侍候人的。”他们对材料工作没有兴趣。为了搞好材料供应工作，必须要求从领导上起认识到材料和材料供应工作的重要性，加强材料工作人员的政治教育，关心他们的工作，及时进行检查。这是目前首先要解决的一个思想认识问题。
            有些单位缺乏整体观念
    必须在材料运用上，树立起整体观念。有些生产单位认为国产炭精棒和铁砂皮质量低，成本高，不合经济核算的要求，但不知只有提倡使用国货，国货产量才能增加，质量才能提高。在这一崇高的爱国主义的精神之下，一个小单位的生产成本暂时受些影响（事实上还不都是如此）又算得什么？有些工厂不愿自制配件，认为配件太零碎，吃力不讨好，不如修大东西容易表现成绩，容易得到工厂奖励基金。有的单位在核定资金以后，要求把剩余材料赶快运走，不肯代管，认为管理费事，虚占仓库；但不知全国普遍核定资金，大量剩余材料上缴中央，如果原经管单位都不肯利用原有仓库予以代管，那么政府就得要大量投资兴建集中仓库。这样要浪费人力和财力。现在政府号召核定资金，实行经济核算，如果对整体观念问题认识不清，势必损害人民国家的利益。
            今后努力的方向
    今后材料工作者必须在思想上解决下面几个问题，才能做好材料工作。
    首先必须严格执行制度：我们材料工作的新的管理办法的执行，首先需要全体材料人员清除本位主义思想，树立高度的整体观念，没有这个整体观念，我们的材料工作将发生极大的困难。
    其次，材料部门应与生产部门密切地打成一片。做好材料供应工作的第一步要求，是掌握先进的消费定额和材料标准化。达成这个要求，必须取得生产部门的充分了解和有力的协助，并依靠生产部门的努力。这就是说生产部门与材料供应部门是血肉相关，甘苦与共的。只有在紧密合作，相互督促之下，才能提高供应效率，完成生产任务。
    第三，充分利用呆料废料，尽量避免新呆料的发生。因而重视利用呆废料是一桩政治任务，树立利用呆废料思想，并建立利用呆废料的奖励办法，以便激起工人利用呆废料的积极性和创造性。
