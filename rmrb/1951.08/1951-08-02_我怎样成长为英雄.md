　　How I Grew to Be a Hero
　　Combat Hero of the Fourth Field Army Zhao Xingyuan
　　Today, on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, it is beneficial to recall my own short history. Over the past ten years, I have fought from Shandong to Northeast China, from the Songhua River to Hainan Island. I have been awarded two special merits, six major merits, and seven minor merits in combat and work, and have received titles such as Model Youth Captain, Model Political Work Cadre, All-Round Meritorious Person, and Combat Hero. But why was I able to achieve these results in combat and work, and be selected as a hero, model, and meritorious person? Why was I able to transform from an uneducated farm boy into a mid-level commander in the People's Liberation Army? First and foremost, I must thank the Communist Party for nurturing and educating me. The Party taught me that poverty is not predetermined, but is due to the existence of classes and exploitation. This gave me a preliminary understanding of revolutionary principles. Joining the Communist Party further enabled me to gradually grow and improve.

　　I clearly remember that when I first fought the Japanese devils in Laiwu, Shandong, I was only sixteen years old. The battle was fierce, and both the platoon leader and squad leader were killed. It was my first time on the battlefield, and I was somewhat timid, but I firmly remembered what the Party group leader had told me on weekdays: "Communist Party members should be brave in combat, charge ahead, and retreat last." Although I had not yet joined the Party at that time, I felt that being a Party member was glorious and that I should learn from Party members. His words gave me strength, and I charged at the very front of the company, wounded a Japanese devil, and seized a bayonet and a steel helmet from him. After the battle, the superiors praised me as a "little hero," and I felt that this was the greatest glory and happiness of my life.

　　In the autumn of 1942, the Japanese devils carried out a "mopping-up" operation in Shandong. I was a platoon leader at that time, suffering from malignant malaria, but the situation was urgent, and I needed to lead this platoon behind enemy lines to fight guerrilla warfare. Before leaving, Shen Ping, the branch secretary of the battalion, shook my hand and said, "Zhao Xingyuan, the Party has entrusted the team to you. I wish you success in completing the task and returning victoriously." Thus, I led a platoon to maneuver with the enemy, sometimes going into the mountains, sometimes going hungry, and also lecturing the soldiers and answering questions. Later, my malaria became more and more severe, almost making it impossible for me to work. However, as soon as I thought of the entrustment that Comrade Shen Ping, the branch secretary of the battalion, had given me before leaving, and thought that a Communist Party member should overcome difficulties and not be subdued by them, I immediately woke up from my stupor and insisted on commanding the battle and carrying out work. By the day the counter-mopping-up operation ended and we met up with the brigade, my body was so weak that I was lying on a stretcher unable to move, but I felt happy and excited because I had once again accepted the Party's test, I had completed the task, and I had not allowed the Party's strength to suffer losses!

　　In 1946, when I became a political instructor, I lacked working methods and only knew how to bury myself in my work alone. I often strained my eyes from working too hard, but the work still didn't go well. Later, in order to cultivate and improve me, the Party admitted me to the division's political work conference. At that meeting, I learned for the first time what the mass line working method was. The secretary of the division's Party committee said, "Methods must be found among the masses, the masses are the teachers." This greatly enlightened me. After that, I consulted with everyone on everything, and also created some mass line working methods, which completely changed the face of the company's work and made it a model company for the entire division. On the other hand, the division also often admitted me to the meetings of battalion-level cadres, which broadened my horizons in political work and helped me find the way. At the same time, the superior Party organization also frequently helped me summarize my work, so that I could constantly improve. Therefore, in a very short period of time, I, who originally did not know how to work, was elected as a model political work cadre of the division.

　　When I first started fighting, I relied only on bravery and didn't understand tactics much, so the effect of the battles was not great. But under the leadership of the Party and the education of Chairman Mao's military thought, I have won victories in every battle.

　　In the winter of 1948, during the battle for the Peishui Pool on the outskirts of Jinzhou, the enemy fiercely counterattacked my battalion with aircraft, artillery, tanks, and superior infantry. At the height of the battle, the enemy infantry charged to the eaves of our houses, only a wall away from us, and grenades could be thrown directly into the house, with casualties every minute. We persisted for ten hours, and only five comrades in the entire battalion were not wounded. Finally, I led five soldiers to launch a counterattack in coordination with fraternal units, and captured the enemy's strongly fortified Peishui Pool, opening the door for the attack on Jinzhou. In this battle, what supported and encouraged us to persevere to the end was what Commander Lin Biao told us: "The fighting style that the people's army should have is to be able to attack and defend, and to be brave, tenacious, and resolutely unyielding." On another occasion, in the battle of Bailian City on Hainan Island, I applied Commander Lin's bayonet tactics, boldly inserting a platoon into the heart of the enemy, blocking the enemy's retreat. Subsequently, under the rapid attack of the entire battalion, we annihilated an enemy army headquarters and three regiments. Because the enemy's command headquarters was eliminated, the four enemy divisions that were stubbornly resisting in front collapsed, creating favorable conditions for the liberation of Hainan Island.

　　In this way, the Party gave me courage and ability, so that I could defeat the enemy in every battle and overcome difficulties in every task. For more than ten years, the army has become my home, and the Party is my mother. A child who is not cared for by his mother cannot grow well, so I look forward to every test the Party gives me. I am happy to be able to complete every task the Party gives me, and I will answer the Party and the people's cultivation and education of me by completing even greater tasks. Now, I guarantee that I will not be arrogant or complacent, and will continue to contribute everything I have to strengthen our national defense forces and defend the cause of peace in the motherland and the world.

### 我怎样成长为英雄

　　我怎样成长为英雄
    第四野战军战斗英雄  赵兴元
    今天，在中国人民解放军建军节二十四周年的时候，来回忆一下自己暂短的历史是有好处的。十多年来，我从山东打到东北，从松花江打到海南岛。我在战斗和工作上立了两个特功、六个大功、七个小功，并获得了模范青年队长、模范政治工作干部、全面功臣及战斗英雄等称号。但是，为什么我能够在战斗和工作中获得这些成绩，并被选为英雄、模范和功臣呢？为什么能从一个没有知识的农家小孩子锻炼成一个人民解放军的中级指挥员呢？首先要感谢的是共产党对我的培养和教育。党教导我说：人穷不是命定的，是因为有阶级有剥削。这使我初步懂得了革命道理。参加共产党后，更使我逐渐成长提高。
    我清楚地记得，第一次在山东莱芜和日本鬼子作战的时候，我还只有十六岁。战斗很激烈，排长和班长都牺牲了。我第一次上战场，有些胆怯，但心里却牢牢记着平日党小组长对我讲的话：“共产党员应该作战勇敢，要冲锋在前，退却在后。”虽然那时我还没有入党，却感到作一个党员是光荣的，应当向党员学习。他的话就使我产生了力量，我冲在全连的最前面，打伤了一个日本鬼子，从他手里夺了一把刺刀，一顶钢盔。战斗结束后，上级表扬我是“小英雄”，我感到这是我生平第一次最大的光荣和快乐。
    一九四二年秋天，日本鬼子对山东进行“扫荡”。我那时是排长，正患恶性疟疾，但情况很急，我需要带这一排人到敌后打游击。临走时，营的分支书记沈平同志握着我的手说：“赵兴元，党把队伍交给你了，祝你完成任务胜利回来。”这样，我就带着一排人和敌人周旋，有时钻山，有时饿肚子，还要给战士讲课，解答问题。后来，我的疟疾愈来愈重，几乎使我不能工作。但是我一想起营分支书记沈平同志临别时对我的托付，又想到一个共产党员应该战胜困难而不为困难所屈服，就立刻从昏迷中急醒过来，坚持指挥作战和进行工作。等到反扫荡结束，我们和大队会合的那一天，我的身体已经哀弱到躺在担架上不能动了，但心里却是愉快和兴奋，因为我再次接受了党给我的考验，我完成了任务，我没有使党的力量受到损失！
    一九四六年我当指导员时，缺少工作办法，只知道自己一人埋头干，常因工作过累熬红了眼睛，但工作仍搞不好。后来党为了培养我，提高我，吸收我参加师的政治工作会议。在那次会议上，我第一次知道了什么叫群众路线的工作方法。师党委书记说：“办法要到群众中去找，群众就是老师。”这大大启发了我。以后，有事我就找大家一起商量，并且也创造了一些群众路线的工作方法，使连队工作的面目完全改变了，成为全师的模范连队。另一方面师在召开营一级干部会议时，也常吸收我参加，这样，就使我在政治工作方面打开了眼界，摸着了门路。同时，上级党又经常帮助我总结工作，使我能不断地提高。因此，在很短的时期中，我这个原先不懂得怎样工作的人，却被选为师的模范政治工作干部了。
    最初打仗时，我只凭勇敢，不大懂得战术，所以作战的效果也就不大。但在党的领导下，在毛主席的军事思想教育下，使我在历次战斗中获得了胜利。
    一九四八年冬季锦州外围配水池战斗中，当时敌人以飞机、大炮、坦克及优势步兵向我一营猛烈反击。战斗最激烈时，敌人的步兵冲到我方屋詹下，与我们只有一墙之隔，手榴弹可以直接投到屋内，每一分钟都有伤亡。我们一直坚持了十小时，全营只剩下五个同志没有负伤。最后，我带着五个战士在兄弟部队配合下发起反攻，夺下了敌人强固的设防地点配水池，为进攻锦州打开了大门。在这个战斗中，支持与鼓舞我们坚持到底的就是林彪司令员告诉我们的话：“人民军队所应具有的战斗作风是攻得下，守得住，英勇顽强坚决不屈。”另一次在海南岛白莲市战斗中，我应用了林司令员的尖刀战术，以一个排的兵力大胆插入敌人心脏，堵住了敌人退路，随后在全营的迅速攻击下，歼灭敌人一个军部指挥所和三个团。由于敌人的指挥首脑被消灭，使正在前方顽抗的敌人四个师溃退下来，为解放海南岛创造了有利条件。
    这样，党给了我勇气，也给了我本领，使我能在每一次战斗中都战胜敌人，在每一件工作上都能克服困难。十多年来，军队成了我的家，党就是我的母亲。一个没有母亲关怀照顾的小孩是长不好的，因此我期待着党给我的每一次考验，我以能够完成党给我的每一件任务而愉快，并以完成更大的任务来回答党和人民对我的培养和教育。现在，我保证不骄不傲，继续为加强我们的国防力量和保卫祖国与世界和平事业而贡献出自己的一切。（四野新闻科）
