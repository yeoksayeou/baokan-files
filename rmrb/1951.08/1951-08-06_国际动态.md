　　International Developments
    Unwilling to Serve as Cannon Fodder for Aggression
　　A U.S. Army sergeant named Ford, stationed in Vienna, Austria, deserted from his U.S. infantry regiment at the end of July. Before deserting, Ford told his comrades that he was going to be sent to Korea. The fear of being sent to Korea to die has become one of the main reasons for the desertion of many U.S. officers and soldiers stationed in Austria.
　　The American warmongers are eager to expand their aggression, but many soldiers are unwilling to give their lives for this unpopular war. This is a weakness that the American aggressors cannot overcome.

　　British Mothers Can No Longer Endure It
　　When the British Minister of Defense, Shinwell, gave a speech at a Labor Party meeting in Scotland on July 28, two British women threw eggs at him. One of them shouted: "Shinwell, what a conscientious objector you are! You have sent my son to fight." Because of this, the two women were arrested by the police.
　　Shinwell's criminal actions of following the U.S. imperialist war policy and trying his best to provide cannon fodder for aggression have made the mothers of British children unable to endure it any longer. The atrocities of the arrest will only arouse greater anger among the broad masses of British women.

　　Shameful Baton Policy
　　Wachter (the West German representative), a member of the International Democratic Women's Federation's "Investigation Team on Atrocities Committed by U.S. Troops in Korea," was recently arrested in Freiburg-im-Breisgau, West Germany, by the Bonn puppet government. This was because she was going to tell everyone the truth about what she saw in Korea at a conference hosted by the German Democratic Women's Federation. Mrs. Dans, the director of the South Baden branch of the German Democratic Women's Federation, was also arrested with her.
　　U.S. imperialism and its running dog Adenauer want to use brutal means to prevent the people from knowing the monstrous crimes committed by the U.S. and British aggressors in Korea, but the bloody facts of the aggressors in Korea cannot be concealed by any despicable means.

    不愿充当侵略炮灰
    驻在奥地利首都维也纳的一个美军军曹福尔，在七月底从他所属的美国步兵团中逃亡。在逃亡之前，福尔曾对他的同伴说，他将要被派到朝鲜去。害怕被派到朝鲜去送死，已经成为驻奥许多美军官兵逃亡的主要原因之一了。
    美国战争贩子们亟图扩大进行侵略，但许多士兵却不愿为这个不得人心的战争卖命，这是美国侵略者力不从心永远无法克服的弱点。
            英国母亲忍无可忍了
    英国国防大臣辛威尔七月二十八日在苏格兰某地的工党会议上演说时，有两个英国妇女向他投掷鸡蛋。其中一个喊道：“辛威尔，你好一个有良心的反对兵役的人！你已把我的儿子派去作战了。”因为这样，两个妇女都被警察逮捕了去。
    辛威尔追随美帝国主义战争政策，尽力提供侵略炮灰的罪恶行动，已经使英国孩子的母亲们忍无可忍了，逮捕的暴行只有激起英国广大妇女的更加愤怒。
            可耻的警棒政策
    国际民主妇联“侵朝美军暴行调查团”的团员瓦赫特（西德代表），最近在西德的夫赖堡——布赖斯高城被波恩傀儡政府逮捕。因为她在一个由德国民主妇联所主持的大会上，要把在朝鲜所看到的一切真相告诉大家，与她同时被捕的还有德国民主妇联南巴登分会理事丹斯夫人。
    美帝国主义与它的走狗阿登纳，想用横蛮的手段来阻止人民知道美、英侵略者在朝鲜所犯的滔天罪行，但是侵略者在朝鲜的血的事实，是使用任何卑劣手段也掩盖不了的。
