Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 19th: General Nam Il sent a letter of protest to Admiral Joy, the full text of which is as follows:

To: Vice Admiral Joy, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command:

　　At 05:55 hours on the morning of August 19th, nine of our military police, led by Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang, who were performing guard duties in the Kaesong Neutral Zone in accordance with the agreement, were patrolling eastwards from the highlands north of Songgok-ri, southwest of Panmunjom, when they were attacked by approximately 30 armed personnel from your side who had illegally entered the Neutral Zone and ambushed near Songgok-ri. Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang and soldier Wang Renyuan were seriously wounded on the spot. Your personnel then fired two more shots into the forehead of our military police platoon leader Yao Qingxiang, who was already seriously wounded, resulting in the death of Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang. Our delegation liaison officer notified your liaison officer at 08:30 hours, requesting that your side immediately send personnel to conduct a joint investigation. An on-the-spot investigation was immediately conducted jointly by the liaison officers of both sides. Local residents, our police personnel, and the physical evidence at the scene of the incident fully confirmed the truth of the above facts. Since both sides reached the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement, your side has repeatedly violated the agreement. Your aircraft have continuously intruded into the airspace over the Neutral Zone, repeatedly strafing the supply vehicles of our delegation. Your armed personnel have frequently fired into the Neutral Zone. We have repeatedly protested, but your side has never given a satisfactory reply. On July 17th, I called your attention to the incident of your armed personnel firing into Panmunjom within the Neutral Zone. On August 7th, the incident of your armed personnel firing into Panmunjom again was brought to your serious attention, and a protest was lodged with you, but you repeatedly deliberately shirked responsibility and have never provided a satisfactory reply. This serious incident, in which your armed personnel illegally entered the Neutral Zone, taking advantage of the fact that our military police were performing police duties without making any combat preparations, and shot and seriously wounded our military police platoon leader Yao Qingxiang and soldier Wang Renyuan, who were faithfully implementing the Neutral Zone Agreement, is the culmination of your side's lawless acts of disregarding the agreement that both sides should jointly abide by and consistently sabotaging the Neutral Zone Agreement. I must point out the seriousness of this incident of your side's violation of the Neutral Zone Agreement. We have consistently believed that the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement should be observed by both sides to ensure its implementation, but the facts prove that your side is constantly undermining this agreement, which should be jointly observed by both sides. We have consistently believed that if any violation of the Neutral Zone Agreement occurs on either side, it should be resolved through protests, investigations, consultations, and other methods to facilitate the progress of the armistice negotiations, but the facts prove that your side has consistently rejected all our efforts to seek ways to resolve your side's violations of the agreement. This incident is the inevitable result of your side's consistent policy of violating the agreement and refusing to resolve problems in a reasonable manner, and this is intolerable. I lodge a serious protest with you and firmly demand that you: (1) Severely punish the culprits on your side who shot and killed our military police platoon leader Yao Qingxiang and seriously wounded soldier Wang Renyuan. (2) Thoroughly guarantee that your side will not commit any further incidents that violate the Neutral Zone Agreement. I demand that you give me a satisfactory reply immediately.

　　美方武装人员违反协议袭击中立区
    南日将军向乔埃严重抗议
    痛斥美方一贯破坏协议，坚决要求惩凶并保证不再发生同类事件。
    【新华社开城十九日电】南日将军致乔埃抗议书，全文如下：联合国军首席代表乔埃海军中将：
    八月十九日上午五时五十五分，根据协议担任开城中立区警卫任务的我方军事警察九人，由排长姚庆祥率领，沿板门店西南之松谷里以北高地向东巡逻时，为你方非法进入中立区并预先埋伏在松谷里附近的武装人员约三十余人所袭击，排长姚庆祥、战士王仁元当场受重伤，你方人员更进而向已负重伤之我军事警察排长姚庆祥前额上连发两枪，排长姚庆祥因而牺牲。我方代表团联络官在八时三十分通知你方联络官，要求你方立即派员共同进行调查。当即由双方联络官共同进行实地调查，当地居民与我方警察人员以及出事地点的物证，都充分地证实了以上事实的真实性。自从双方达成开城中立区协议以来，你方一再破坏协议，你方飞机不断侵入中立区上空，一再扫射我方代表团的供应车辆，你方武装人员经常向中立区射击，我方屡提抗议，你方从未给与满意答复。七月十七日我曾就你方武装人员向中立区内板门店射击事，提请你的注意。八月七日你方武装人员再度向板门店射击事，又曾提请你方的严重的注意，并向你提出抗议，而你一再故意推卸责任，始终没有提出满意的答复。此次你方武装人员非法进入中立区，乘我方军事警察执行警察任务未作任何作战准备之便，枪杀和重伤我忠实执行中立区协议的军事警察排长姚庆祥和战士王仁元的严重事情，实是你方目无双方应该共同遵守的协议，一贯破坏中立区协议的不法事件的最高峰。我必须指出：此次你方破坏中立区协议的事件的严重性。我们一贯认为开城中立区的协议，应该得到双方的遵守，才能保证实现，但事实证明你方是在不断破坏这个应有双方共同遵守的协议。我们一贯认为任何一方如有违反中立区协议事件发生，应该经由抗议、调查、协商等办法解决，以利于停战谈判之进行，但事实证明你方却一直拒绝我方寻求办法以解决你方破坏协议事件的一切努力。此次事件是你方一贯破坏协议，并拒绝用合理办法解决问题的政策的必然结果，而这是不可容忍的。我向你提出严重抗议并坚决要求你：（一）严惩你方枪杀我军事警察排长姚庆祥及重伤战士王仁元的凶手。（二）彻底保证你方不再发生违反中立区协议的任何事件。我要求你立即给我满意答复。
