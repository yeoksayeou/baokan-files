Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 29th: A special correspondent of this agency reported on the situation in Kaesong after the U.S. air raid, saying: Since the U.S. perpetrators bombed and strafed the conference site in order to murder our negotiating representatives, the first and most obvious reaction in the minds of the people of Kaesong is: air raids are threatening them again. This city, which was designated as a neutral zone during the armistice negotiations, was brightly lit every night before August 22, but from the night of August 23, it was once again shrouded in the black of air defense.

Kaesong is a city with more than 12,000 households. Since the beginning of the war, the U.S. aggressors' air force, like in the destruction of other peaceful cities in Korea, had destroyed more than half of the houses in this ancient capital. As late as four days before the preparatory meeting for the armistice negotiations, on July 4, three U.S. planes flew to Kaesong to attack, completely destroying more than 50 houses in Yunhe-ri and Baiyun-dong in the eastern suburbs. Afterwards, although U.S. planes still intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone from time to time, people always thought: U.S. planes would not be so despicable as to carry out air raids on the neutral zone.

The events of the night of August 22 educated the people of Kaesong, making them more clearly aware of the rogue face of U.S. imperialism. Since the start of the armistice negotiations, the population of Kaesong has increased from 20,000 to more than 30,000. People who returned to their homes picked up wooden boards, sheet metal, and iron nails from the ruins, and worked busily to build houses. Now people are evacuating the city one after another and have stopped building. The bustling market that had recovered during the armistice negotiations has also begun to become deserted. All the people staying in the city are busily repairing air-raid shelters, evacuating supplies and equipment, and preparing to deal with enemy attacks at any time. The bombs dropped by U.S. military aircraft in the Kaesong conference area threaten the peace and security of the Kaesong neutral zone. The people of Kaesong smelled the smell of gunpowder again.

Since the beginning of the armistice negotiations, the people of Kaesong have been watching the development of the conference with a longing for peace, hoping for its success. However, when the first U.S. helicopter landed in Kaesong, the people of Kaesong heard the cries coming from Seoul: "Attack to the Yalu River and completely realize the victory of the Northern Expedition." During the armistice negotiations, the people of Kaesong also heard the voices boasting of "air and sea superiority" full of murderous intent, the sound of U.S. and Rhee bandit warships bombarding both sides of the Richeng River, the sound of U.S. and Rhee air force bombings, the sound of U.S. planes buzzing through the sky over Kaesong, and the sound of gunshots from the repeated provocations of the U.S. and Rhee bandit troops at Panmunjom, east of Kaesong. All of this kept the people of Kaesong highly vigilant. Since the provocative incident of the U.S. plane bombing Kaesong on the night of August 22, the people of Kaesong have been telling each other: "The American devils are determined to sabotage the armistice negotiations."

The people of Kaesong, like all the Korean people, harbor deep hatred for the enemies of peace. Since the beginning of the armistice negotiations, American reporters who came to Kaesong have tried to lure Kaesong children with canned food and candy to take shots. The children of Kaesong ruthlessly rejected this temptation, picked up the candy, and threw it back at the other party contemptuously and angrily. The children are like this, and the adults are even more so. When an American reporter wanted to photograph a group of Koreans, a young man walked over, slapped him hard, kicked him, and sternly warned him: "You are not allowed to do this!" This young man will never forget the scar left on his own face. In a bombing, a gasoline bomb dropped by a U.S. plane burned his cheeks. In addition, an elderly old woman, when an American reporter visited her, said to that American reporter: "Get out! You are not worthy to talk to me!" This is the heroic image of the fighting people of Kaesong. This is a manifestation of the strong national self-esteem of the Korean people. The people of Kaesong inherit their glorious tradition and resolutely fight for the freedom of their motherland. Recently, workers, young people, and students in Kaesong City have been running to the Municipal Committee of the Workers' Party every day, asking for permission to go to northern Korea. A young female teacher named Park Ji-nam resolutely joined the Korean People's Army. She said: "For the independence and peace of the motherland, I am determined to dedicate myself completely to the motherland."

　　开城人民痛恨美国破坏谈判
    坚决表示要为争取祖国自由而奋斗
    【新华社开城二十九日电】本社特派记者报道开城在美机轰炸后的情形称：自从美国行凶者为谋害我方谈判代表在会议地址上空轰炸、扫射以后，开城人民意识中第一个最明显的反应就是：空袭又在威胁着他们了。这个在停战谈判期间被划为中立区的城市，在八月二十二日以前，每夜灯火辉煌，而从二十三日晚起，重又披上了防空的黑衣。
    开城是一个有着一万二千多户居民的城市。战争开始以后，美国侵略者的空军像毁灭朝鲜其他和平城市一样，将这个古都的房屋破坏过半。直到举行停战谈判会议预备会议的前四天，即七月四日，还曾有三架美国飞机飞到开城来袭击，将东郊云鹤里、白云洞五十余户房屋全部炸毁。以后，美国飞机虽然仍不时侵入开城中立区上空，但人们总想着：美国飞机还不至于干出空袭中立区的卑鄙勾当来。
    八月二十二日夜晚的事件教育了开城人民，使他们更清楚地认识了美帝国主义的流氓面目。从停战谈判开始以来，开城的人口从两万人增加到三万余人。重返家园的人们从废墟上捡出木板、洋铁皮、铁钉，忙碌地修建房屋。现在人们纷纷撤离市区，停止了修筑。停战谈判期间恢复起来的热闹的市集，现在也开始冷落了。所有留住在市区的人们正在紧张地修理防空洞，疏散物资、器具，准备随时应付敌人的袭击。美国军用飞机在开城会议地区投掷的炸弹，威胁着开城中立区的和平与安全。开城人民又闻到了火药的气息。
    停战谈判开始以来，开城人们怀着渴望和平的心情，睁大着眼睛，注视着会议的发展，期待着会议的成功。但是，当美国的第一架直升飞机在开城降落的时候，开城人民就听到了从汉城传来的叫嚣：“打到鸭绿江边，彻底实现北伐的胜利。”在停战谈判期间，开城人民又听到杀气腾腾地夸耀“海空优势”的声音，听到美李匪军舰艇向礼成江两岸轰击的炮声和美李空军的轰炸声，听到美机从开城市空嗡嗡飞过的马达声和美李匪军在开城以东板门店一再挑衅所发出的枪声。这一切，都使开城人民保持着高度的警觉。从八月二十二日晚美机轰炸开城的挑衅事件发生以后，开城人民便互相告诉着：“美国鬼子决心破坏停战谈判了。”
    开城人民同全朝鲜人民一样，对和平的敌人怀着深刻的仇恨。停战谈判开始以来，来到开城的美国记者曾经想用罐头和糖果引诱开城儿童，摄取镜头。开城的儿童无情地拒绝了这种引诱，拾起糖果，轻蔑地同时又是愤怒地抛回对方。儿童们是如此，成人们更是如此。当一个美国记者要拍摄一群朝鲜人的时候，有一个青年人走过去，狠狠地打了他一记耳光，踢了他一脚，并且严厉地警告他说：“不准你这样做！”这个青年人永远不能忘记留在他自己脸上的创痕，在一次轰炸中，美国飞机投掷的汽油弹曾经烧坏了他的脸腮。另外有一位年迈的老妇在一个美国记者访问她时，对那个美国记者说：“滚开！你不配跟我讲话！”这就是战斗的开城人民的英雄形象。这是朝鲜人民强烈的民族自尊心的表现。开城人民继承着自己光荣的传统，为着争取祖国的自由而坚决奋斗。最近，开城市每天都有工人、青年、学生跑到劳动党市委员会去，请求允许他们到朝鲜北部去。有一个名叫朴姬南的青年女教师毅然参加了朝鲜人民军。她说：“为了祖国的独立与和平，我决心把自己完全献给祖国。”
