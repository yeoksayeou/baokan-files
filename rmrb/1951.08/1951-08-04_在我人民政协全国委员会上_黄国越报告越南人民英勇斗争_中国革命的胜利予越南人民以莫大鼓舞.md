　　[Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference invited Huang Guoyue, head of the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China, on the 2nd to report on the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people. More than 800 representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations, including Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, Zhang Hanfu, Mei Gongbin, Huang Qixiang, Zhang Jiongbo, and Zhu Zaoguan, participated.

　　Amidst warm applause, Comrade Huang Guoyue began his report. He first introduced the situation of the Vietnamese people's heroic resistance against the French aggressors over the past five years. He said that in the winter of 1946, the French imperialists launched a colonial war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At the beginning of the war, the French army quickly occupied major cities such as Saigon, Hanoi, and Haiphong. However, soon, under the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese army and people, the French invading army was forced to be confined to major cities, forming a situation of dispersed forces, thus changing the situation. In October 1947, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated 6,000 enemies in a battle in North Vietnam, which ended the defensive phase of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against France.

　　Since the French imperialists were unable to launch large-scale offensives, after the war entered a stalemate, they turned to actively carrying out national and religious division work and establishing the Bao Dai puppet regime. At this time, President Ho Chi Minh put forward the slogan of training soldiers and making meritorious deeds, calling on the Vietnamese people to universally launch guerrilla warfare. Under this slogan, the Vietnamese people constantly attacked the enemy and continuously expanded and consolidated the liberated areas. In September 1950, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated a large number of enemies along the Gaoping and Lang Son lines in North Vietnam, and then successively won several battles in central North Vietnam, coastal areas, and the Red River Delta, thus changing the military situation in North Vietnam, the base of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance. From the beginning of the war to the present, the Vietnamese People's Army has annihilated 175,000 French troops. Now, the Vietnamese people are actively preparing for a general counter-offensive.

　　Comrade Huang Guoyue then introduced the achievements of the Vietnamese people in politics, economy, and culture. He emphasized that since the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930, the Vietnamese people's revolutionary movement has always been led by the proletariat. The Labor Party, founded in February this year with Marxist-Leninist theory as its guiding principle, has won the support of the vast majority of the Vietnamese people. In March of this year, Vietnam's two united front organizations, the "Viet Minh" and the "Viet Lien," officially merged to form the Vietnam National United Front. This has further strengthened the unity of the Vietnamese people. At the same time, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia have also established a united national united front organization among the three countries.

　　Comrade Huang finally emphasized that the Vietnamese people's national liberation struggle is closely linked with the worldwide struggle to defend peace and democracy. He said that the victory of the Chinese revolution has given the Vietnamese people tremendous encouragement and greatly strengthened the Vietnamese people's confidence in achieving the final victory of the war of resistance.

　　在我人民政协全国委员会上
    黄国越报告越南人民英勇斗争
    中国革命的胜利予越南人民以莫大鼓舞
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会于二日邀请越南人民访华代表团团长黄国越报告越南人民英勇抗战的情形。参加者有各民主党派和人民团体的代表沈钧儒、马叙伦、章汉夫、梅龚彬、黄琪翔、张炯伯、朱早观等八百余人。
    黄国越团长在热烈的掌声中，开始报告。他首先介绍了五年来越南人民英勇地抗击法国侵略者的情形。他说，一九四六年冬，法国帝国主义者对越南民主共和国发动了殖民战争。在战争开始时，法军很快地占领了西贡、河内、海防等大城市。但是不久，法国侵略军在越南军民的英勇抵抗下，即被迫困守于大城市中，形成兵力分散，因而使形势发生变化。一九四七年十月，越南人民军在北越一次战役中歼敌人六千，这一战役结束了越南人民抗法战争的防御阶段。
    法帝国主义者由于无力发动大规模进攻，在战争进入了相持状态后便转而积极进行民族和宗教的分化工作，建立保大傀儡政权。这时，胡志明主席提出了练兵立功的口号，号召越南人民普遍发动游击战争。在这一口号下，越南人民不断地打击敌人，不断地扩大和巩固解放区。一九五○年九月，越南人民军在北越高平和谅山一线歼灭了大量的敌人，接着又在北越中部、沿海地区及红河三角洲连续打了几次胜仗，因而改变了越南人民抗战的基地——北越的军事形势。从战争开始到现在，越南人民军已歼灭法军十七万五千人。现在，越南人民正在积极准备总反攻。
    黄国越团长接着介绍越南人民在政治、经济和文化方面的成就。他着重指出：从一九三○年东洋共产党成立起，越南人民的革命运动一直是由无产阶级领导的。今年二月成立的以马列主义理论为指导原则的劳动党，获得了越南广大人民的拥护。今年三月，越南的两个统一战线组织“越盟”和“越联”正式合并，成立越南国民联合战线。这更加加强了越南人民的团结。同时，越南和老挝，柬埔寨，也建立了三个国家间的联合民族统一战线组织。
    黄团长最后强调：越南人民的民族解放斗争和全世界保卫和平民主的斗争是紧密地连在一起的。他说：中国革命的胜利给了越南人民以莫大的鼓舞，大大地加强了越南人民取得抗战最后胜利的信心。
