    Drawing up Patriotic Production Plans to Challenge Li Shunda's Mutual Aid Team
      Artwork by Li Qun
    Editor's Note: Comrade Li Qun's woodcut reflects the enthusiastic patriotic production movement currently underway in our country's rural areas. The image of the working people depicted by the author is accurate. Not many woodcut works have appeared in the past two years. Woodcut artists should fully utilize the characteristics of this art form to reflect the new struggles and lives of the broad masses of people.

    订爱国丰产计划向李顺达互助组应战
      力群作
    编者按：力群同志的这幅木刻，反映了当前我国农村中进行着的热烈的爱国主义丰产运动。作者所表现的劳动人民的形象是正确的。两年来木刻作品出现的不多，木刻艺术家应该充分发挥这种艺术的特点，多多反映广大人民的新的斗争和生活。
