Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th. Prominent Indian figures, political leaders, and writers have condemned the US's separate peace treaty with Japan and its aggressive plot to rearm Japan.

　　Basu, a Communist member of the Legislative Assembly of West Bengal, said: "The Indian people can never tolerate this vicious conspiracy of American imperialism. Any threat in any part of Asia, especially any threat to India's friendly neighbor—the new People's China—is of deep concern to us. The Indian people oppose the rearming of Japan, oppose foreign interference in Japan's internal affairs, and advocate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Japan. India advocates the signing of a genuine peace treaty with Japan by all countries that participated in the war against Japan, and opposes bilateral treaty methods. We will strive to achieve these demands for our own benefit, and stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Asian countries and the Soviet Union. Our demand to American imperialism is: 'Hands off Asia' and 'No separate peace treaty with the Japanese rulers'."

　　Mrs. Aruna Asaf Ali, a leader of the Left Wing Socialist Party, said: "Indian public opinion believes that the unilateral agreement between the US government and the Japanese rulers is completely untenable and will be opposed." She listed the reasons for opposition as follows: (1) This agreement disregards the opinions of Asian countries; (2) It means turning the Japanese archipelago into a huge base for the United States to destroy Asian freedom; (3) It means launching a war in Asia.

　　Romesh Thapar, editor-in-chief of the Bombay English weekly *Crossroads*, stated: "The Indian people demand a just peace treaty with Japan." He said: The revival of Japanese militarism with the help of American monopoly capital is the greatest threat to peace and progress in Asia. He said: The Indian people hate the enemies of Asian freedom—American imperialism. Even the US Embassy's own official estimates consider that 80 percent of the Indian people are "anti-American." This is because the United States today is seen as the demon of war. He pointed out: "Militarist Japan must not rise again, and the American aggressors will be thwarted. Today's Asia is not yesterday's Asia. The new Chinese giant, under the wise leadership of Mao Zedong, maintains close friendship and alliance with the great and invincible Soviet Union, which is enough to guarantee that peace will triumph over war."

　　Dr. Mulk Raj Anand, a famous Indian novelist and author of world-renowned works such as *Coolie* and *Untouchable*, said: "The attempt by the United States to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan is the inevitable result of the reactionary policy of American imperialists in the Far East and Southeast Asia. I view with suspicion the prospect of the Dulles-MacArthur 'War Treaty' disrupting peace in Asia. The Indian people cannot but oppose this provocative action by the warmongers against their future."

　　Professor Mukerjee, author of *India's Struggle for Freedom* and Secretary-General of the West Bengal "Society for Soviet Friendship," said: "It is very clear that American warmongers are planning to revive Japanese militarism, using a loaded pistol aimed directly at the heart of India's great neighbor—the People's Republic of China—and colluding with reactionaries to form an aggressive political and military alliance against the surging tide of progressive and democratic forces throughout Asia. The ugly face of American imperialism cannot be concealed. The Indian people are vehemently opposed to being dragged into the warmongers' conspiracy net. It is becoming increasingly clear, and the Indian people are recognizing it more clearly day by day, that the reason why American warmongers are proposing to conclude a unilateral agreement with the Japanese ruling class is nothing more than to use the people of Asia (including the Japanese people) as cannon fodder for American imperialism. Therefore, India condemns the extremely insidious attempt by the United States to rearm Japan and use Japan as a pawn in American imperialism's gamble."

### 印度著名人士发表谈话  反对美国武装日本

　　印度著名人士发表谈话
    反对美国武装日本
    【新华社新德里七日电】印度著名人士、政治领袖及作家，谴责美国单独对日媾和与反对重新武装日本的侵略阴谋。
    西孟加拉省立法议会共产党议员巴苏说：“印度人民决不能容忍美帝国主义的这个恶毒的阴谋。亚洲任何地方的任何威胁，特别是对印度的友邻——新生的人民中国——的任何威胁，都与我们有深切关系。印度人民反对重新武装日本，反对外国干涉日本内政，主张一切外国军队撤出日本。印度主张由一切参加对日战争的国家签订真正的对日和约，反对双边条约的办法。我们将为了我们本身利益争取实现这些要求，并且与亚洲各国人民及苏联并肩站在一起。我们对美帝国主义的要求是：‘不许干涉亚洲’，‘不许与日本统治者缔结单独和约’。”
    左翼社会党人的领袖阿鲁娜·阿萨夫·阿里夫人说：“关于美国政府与日本统治者的片面协定，印度的舆论认为它完全不能成立，并将加以反对。”她列举反对的理由如下：（一）这种协定无视亚洲各国的意见；（二）它意味着把日本群岛变成美国用来毁灭亚洲自由的庞大基地；（三）它意味着在亚洲发动战争。
    孟买英文《十字路》周刊总编辑罗米什·塔巴尔表示：“印度人民要求公正的对日和约”。他说：日本军国主义在美国垄断资本帮助下复活，是对亚洲和平与进步的最大威胁。他说：印度人民痛恨亚洲自由的敌人——美帝国主义。甚至美国驻印度大使馆自己的官方估计也认为：印度人民中有百分之八十是“反美”的。这是因为今日的美国已被视为战争的恶魔。他指出：“军国主义的日本不能再起，美国侵略者将要碰壁。今天的亚洲已经不是昨天的亚洲了。新中国巨人在英明的毛泽东的领导下，与伟大的不可战胜的苏联保持亲密的友谊和联盟，这就足以保证和平将战胜战争。”
    著名印度小说家、世界名著《苦力》、《贱民》等书的作者莫尔克·拉吉·安纳达博士说：“美国要签订单独对日和约的企图，是美帝国主义者在远东和东南亚的反动政策的必然结果。我以猜疑的眼光看待扰乱亚洲和平的杜勒斯—麦克阿瑟《战争条约》的前景。印度人民不能不反对战争贩子的这种向他们前途挑衅的行动。”
    《印度为自由而斗争》一书的作者、西孟加拉“苏联之友”社秘书长慕寇吉教授说：“十分明显，美国战争贩子正在计划复活日本的军国主义，用一支上了膛的手枪直接瞄准印度的伟大友邻——中华人民共和国——的心脏，并且纠合反动分子成立侵略性的政治军事联盟，反对整个亚洲的进步民主力量澎湃的潮流。美帝国主义的丑恶面目是掩盖不住的。印度人民无比激愤地反对把他们拖入战争贩子的阴谋的罗网中。事实愈来愈明显，印度人民也一天比一天更清楚地认识到：美国战争贩子之所以建议与日本统治阶级缔结片面的协定，无非想利用亚洲人民（包括日本人民）替美帝国主义当炮灰。因此，印度斥责美国要想重新武装日本、在美帝国主义的赌局中利用日本作为走卒的十分阴险的企图。”
