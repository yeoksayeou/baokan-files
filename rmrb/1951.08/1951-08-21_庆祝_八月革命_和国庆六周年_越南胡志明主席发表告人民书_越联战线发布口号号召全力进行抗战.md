Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 19th: To celebrate the sixth anniversary of the Vietnamese August Revolution and Vietnamese National Day (August 19th and September 2nd), Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued an open letter to the people. Chairman Ho Chi Minh first paid tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the resistance war, expressed condolences to the honored soldiers and families of the martyrs, and expressed respect to the people of all strata who actively participated in the resistance war.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh expressed his gratitude to the French people and all democracy-loving people in the world who warmly supported the Vietnamese people.

After describing the various atrocities of the French aggressors and the great achievements made by the Vietnamese people in military, political, diplomatic, economic, and cultural fields over the past six years, Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on the Vietnamese people to continue their efforts to fight for true independence and unity. Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out that the closer the enemy gets to its demise, the more frantic and cruel it will become. Therefore, the Vietnamese people must never be complacent or underestimate the enemy. The Vietnamese people should more enthusiastically launch competitions to kill the enemy and perform meritorious deeds and competitions to increase production.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh concluded by pointing out that because the Vietnamese people's war of liberation is a just war, because the Vietnamese people are united as one, and because Vietnam is supported by all democratic people in the world, Vietnam's long-term resistance war will surely be victorious.

	8.	Annihilate the French colonial army! Defeat the American interventionists!
	9.	Long live the independence and unity of Vietnam!
	10. Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!
