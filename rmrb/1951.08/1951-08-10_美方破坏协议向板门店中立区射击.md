Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 8th (Delayed): On the morning of August 7th at 10:45 AM, an incident occurred in the Kaesong area in which US armed personnel violated the Kaesong neutral zone agreement by shooting at the Panmunjom neutral zone. This is the second incident of US armed personnel shooting at the neutral zone in the Panmunjom area. The first similar incident occurred on July 16th at 5:40 PM, and General Nan Ri brought it to the attention of US representative Joy and requested an investigation at the negotiating meeting on July 17th.

Panmunjom is located east of Kaesong, at the eastern edge of the Kaesong neutral zone. In Ridgway's notice to Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai on July 13th regarding the establishment of Kaesong as a neutral zone, it was suggested that the "eastern side of the Kaesong neutral zone be bounded by Panmunjom, the current contact point of our forces," which was agreed to by our side. The US side's continuous acts of shooting at the Panmunjom neutral zone clearly constitute a deliberate violation of the Kaesong neutral zone agreement.

Our liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, was instructed to notify the US liaison officer, Colonel Kinney, in writing at 2:30 PM (Korean time) on August 8th regarding the US armed shooting incident on the 7th, and to bring it to the serious attention of the US side.

The content of our liaison officer's notice to the US liaison officer is as follows:

"At 10:45 AM on August 7th, over forty of your armed personnel proceeded along the road towards the bridge 500 meters from Panmunjom, and upon reaching the vicinity of the bridge, fired light machine guns at the Panmunjom neutral zone. At 11:00 AM, six of the aforementioned forty-plus personnel (one of whom was carrying a handgun, the others carrying automatic rifles and carbines) crossed the bridge and arrived at a point just over 200 meters from Panmunjom, firing at our unarmed personnel in the Panmunjom neutral zone. At the same time, light and heavy machine guns east of the bridge continued to fire at the neutral zone. Automatic rifles and carbines fired over sixty rounds, and the light machine guns fired one burst (thirty rounds). Your side frequently shoots at Panmunjom from Gan'am-dong and the mountains north and south, 1000 meters northeast of Panmunjom, and there is bullet evidence to prove this. The above situation occurred again yesterday. I am instructed by our chief representative to bring the above situation to your serious attention."

　　美方破坏协议向板门店中立区射击
    【新华社开城八日电】（迟到）：八月七日上午十时四十五分，发生了开城以东地区美方武装人员破坏开城中立区协议向板门店中立区射击事件。这是在板门店地方所发生的美方武装人员向中立区射击的第二次事件。第一次同样事件发生在七月十六日下午五时四十分，南日将军曾在七月十七日谈判会议上提请美方代表乔埃注意和调查。
    板门店在开城以东，为开城中立区的东部边缘。七月十三日李奇微给金日成和彭德怀两将军的关于划开城为中立区等问题的通知中，即建议开城“中立区的东面以我们的部队目前的接触地点板门店为界”，当经我方同意。美方连续向中立区板门店射击的行为，显系蓄意破坏开城中立区的协议。
    我方联络官张春山上校已奉命于八日下午二时半（朝鲜时间）将七日的美方武装射击情况书面通知美方联络官肯尼上校，提请美方严重注意。
    我方联络官给美方联络官的通知内容如下：
    “八月七日上午十时四十五分，你方武装人员四十余人沿公路向距板门店五百公尺之大桥前进行至大桥附近时，以轻机枪向板门店中立区射击。十一时，上述四十余人中有六人（内一人手持短枪，其余携自动步枪与卡宾式冲锋枪）越过大桥抵达距板门店二百余公尺处，向板门店中立区我方徒手人员射击。同时桥东的轻重机枪也继续向中立区射击。自动步枪与卡宾枪射击共六十余发，轻机枪射击一梭子（为三十发）。你方经常在甘岩洞、板门店东北一千公尺处之南北山上向板门店射击，均有子弹为证。昨日更发生以上情况，我奉我方首席代表之命，将上述情况提请你方严重注意。”
