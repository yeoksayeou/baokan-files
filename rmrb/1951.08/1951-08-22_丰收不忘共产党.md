　　Never Forget the Communist Party in a Year of Bumper Harvests
    Editor:
    The counties of Nanxian, Huarong, Anxiang, and Changde in the lakeside area of Hunan Province have achieved bumper harvests this year. Since late July, the vast number of farmers in the lakeside counties have begun harvesting early rice. The early rice harvest is very good, with an average yield of over 400 jin per mu. The late rice that is about to be harvested is also expected to be a bumper harvest. Farmers in Nanxian said, "This year, each ear of late rice has more than 220 grains, truly a rare good harvest in many years."
    The farmers all recognize that their bumper harvests are inseparable from the wise leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. They say, "If it were not for the People's Government helping us solve the difficulties of fertilizer, livestock power, and seeds, and repairing the dikes, where would we get this year's bumper harvest?" They propose a guarantee: "Never forget the Communist Party in a year of bumper harvests. We must continue to increase production, do a good job of land reclamation, and make donations and other contributions to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, defend the motherland, and strive to defeat the American wolves as soon as possible." In mid-August, the farmers had already finished harvesting the early rice and were joyfully putting away their winnowing baskets, reed mats, and sickles, preparing to harvest the late rice. One-third of the fields in Anxiang County have already been planted with late rice seedlings.

　　丰收不忘共产党
    编辑同志：
    湖南滨湖地区的南县、华容、安乡、常德等县今年农产丰收。从七月下旬起，滨湖各县广大农民就开始收割早谷。早谷的收成很好，每亩产量平均在四百斤以上。即将收割的粒谷也可得到丰收。南县的农民们说：“今年粒谷每穗谷子有二百二十多粒，真是多少年来难见的好收成。”
    农民们都认识他们得到丰收是和共产党、人民政府的英明领导分不开的。他们说：“要不是人民政府帮助我们解决肥料、畜力、种子的困难，把堤垸修好，那里有今年的丰收。”他们提出保证：“丰收不忘共产党。一定要继续提高生产，做好代耕、捐献等抗美援朝的工作，保卫祖国，争取提早打败美国野心狼。”八月中农民们已经收完了早谷，正喜气洋洋地安置扮桶、围席、镰刀，准备收割粒谷。安乡县有三分之一的田并已经插上了晚秧。
