Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 23rd: The "Labor News" published on the 21st an article by Professor Edes titled "Japanese Remilitarization Brings Hunger and Poverty to the Laboring People." The author points out that as a result of the U.S. imperialists and their Japanese puppets promoting the remilitarization of Japan, the enormous military expenditure burden falls on the shoulders of the Japanese people. Unemployment, hunger, and poverty among the masses are becoming increasingly severe. This year, the occupation costs will exceed 100 billion yen. Under the guise of "public utility expenses," more than 110 billion yen has already been allocated.

Edes continued: The country has fallen into the quagmire of inflation. The amount of paper money in circulation has increased by 116 times compared to before the war, resulting in rising prices. In the first eight months of the Korean War, the prices of food and basic necessities almost doubled, and rents increased by 1.5 times.

Despite the continuous rise in prices, previous maximum wage restrictions still exist. The current maximum wage is only half of the pre-war level.

Harsh labor conditions have emerged in arms factories, where workers must work hard for 12 to 14 hours. In some factories, they sometimes have to work non-stop for 24 hours. In war enterprises, five hours of overtime work has become commonplace and is unpaid. Intolerable labor and semi-starvation living conditions have led to an increase in the disease rate.

Edes then wrote: The U.S. occupying authorities are deliberately supporting the war industry and stifling civilian production, resulting in a continuous increase in the number of unemployed. According to the United Press, there are approximately 18 million fully or partially unemployed people in Japan, accounting for 45 percent of the country's working-age population. 360,000 unemployed families—a total of 1.18 million people—live in small huts exposed to wind, rain, and cold.

The poor have to sell their blood at a price of 200 public centimeters per dollar to supply the wounded soldiers of the intervention army in Korea. Unemployed poor peasants have to sell their children. Many people are unable to survive in difficult material conditions and commit suicide in anger.

Edes concluded by pointing out that more and more people are protesting against the evil policies of the current Japanese rulers. Recently, almost all industrial sectors have been hit by strikes. Workers demand the restoration of the eight-hour workday and increased wages. They oppose the rising cost of living, unaffordable taxes, and suppression of democratic freedoms. The movement against remilitarization and against the conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Japan is becoming more and more popular. Japanese trade unions and various democratic organizations firmly advocate the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with the participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

### 日劳动人民生活困苦  最高工资仅及战前水平一半，贫民被迫出卖儿女

　　日劳动人民生活困苦
    最高工资仅及战前水平一半，贫民被迫出卖儿女
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：《劳动报》二十一日刊载埃德斯教授所作题为“日本重新军国主义化给劳动人民带来饥饿与贫困”一文。作者指出：由于美帝国主义者及其日本傀儡促使日本重新军国主义化的结果，巨大的军费负担落到日本人民肩上。人民大众的失业、饥饿和贫困愈来愈厉害。在今年，占领费用将超过一千亿日元。在“公用事业费”的假名义下，已拨出一千一百亿日元以上。
    埃德斯接着说：这个国家已陷入通货膨胀的泥沼。纸币流通额比战前增加一百一十六倍，从而造成了物价上涨。在朝鲜战争的头八个月中，食品和基本必需品的价格几乎上涨一倍，房租上涨一·五倍。
    尽管物价不断上涨，以前的最高工资限制仍然存在。目前最高工资只及战前水平的一半。
    军火工厂里出现了艰苦的劳动状况，那里的工人必须辛苦工作十二小时至十四小时，在有些工厂，有时必须不停工作二十四小时。在战争企业中，五小时的额外工作已成为常例，而且得不到工资。无法忍受的劳动和半饥饿生活状况，使疾病率增高。
    埃德斯接着写道：美国占领当局有意扶植战争工业，扼杀民用生产，结果使失业人数不断增加。据《联合通讯》说，日本的完全失业或部分失业的人约有一千八百万，占全国有劳动能力的人口的百分之四十五。有三十六万户失业的家庭——共有一百十八万人——住在饱受风吹雨打和寒冷侵袭的小屋里。
    穷人不得不以一美元二百公分的价格出卖自己的血，供给在朝鲜的干涉军的伤兵之用。失业的贫农不得不卖掉自己的儿女。许多人在艰苦的物质环境下难以为生，愤而自杀。
    埃德斯在结语中指出：抗议目前日本的统治者的罪恶政策的民众愈来愈多。最近几乎所有工业部门都受到罢工的打击。工人要求恢复每日八小时工作制和增加工资。他们反对日益增高的生活费用、无法负担的赋税和压制民主自由的行为。反对重新军国主义化、反对缔结单独对日和约的运动一天比一天普及。日本工会和各民主团体坚决主张缔结有苏联和中华人民共和国参加的全面和约。
