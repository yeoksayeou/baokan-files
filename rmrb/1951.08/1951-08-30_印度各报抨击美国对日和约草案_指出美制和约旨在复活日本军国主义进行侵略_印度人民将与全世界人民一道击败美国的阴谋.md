Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 29th: Indian newspapers have been publishing commentaries opposing the U.S. aggressive plot regarding the draft peace treaty with Japan, denouncing the U.S. for excluding China from participating in the treaty, and pointing out the significance of India's refusal to attend the San Francisco conference.

The Bombay English newspaper, *The Free Press Journal*, published an editorial on the 27th titled "A Fraud," stating, "The current peace treaty with Japan is an act of provocation. This treaty is a deceptive thing for the Japanese and Asian people."

The Lucknow Hindi weekly, *Naya Daur* (New Dawn), called on its readers in its August 20th issue to hold rallies and marches and pass resolutions to defeat the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism against the People's Republic of China and Asian peace.

The Calcutta Bengali newspaper, *Swadhinata* (Freedom), published an editorial titled "Defeat the U.S. Plot in Japan," stating, "Let all the people of India shout out their fearless determination against the draft war treaty! Let the Indian people express sincere messages of peace and the wishes of the Indian people through rallies, demonstrations, resolutions, and mass signature campaigns against this treaty! Let the Indian people and the people of the world tear up the illegal votes cast by the lackeys of the U.S. and British war-mongers at the San Francisco conference and vote for laying the foundation for a genuine peace in Japan!"

The New Delhi English daily, *The Indian News Chronicle*, wrote on the 25th: "India obviously cannot participate in such a peace settlement with Japan, because this would only make Japan an appendage of the U.S. in any future war, and would not give Japan a reasonable and lasting future peace."

The newspapers clearly pointed out that the U.S. draft is not a draft for peace, but a draft to prepare for new aggression by Japanese militarism as an ally of the U.S. ruling clique. The newspapers strongly condemned the U.S. note stating that the treaty could not be discussed at the San Francisco conference, and that participants must sign on the dotted line drawn by U.S. rulers.

For example, the Bombay weekly, *Crossroads*, published an editorial on the 24th titled "Don't Talk, Just Sign," stating, "Despite the opposition of most countries that suffered from Japanese terror during the last war, the main purpose of the treaty is still to restore Japanese militarism." "This treaty is not only used to hinder Japan's freedom and peaceful development, but it is also enough to make Japan a base for aggression against the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and to undermine the independence of all Asian countries." The editorial condemned the U.S. for acting arbitrarily, saying: "The shamelessness and arrogance of the United States have truly reached their extreme."

The Hyderabad Urdu daily, *Paigham* (The Message), wrote on the 24th: "The eyes of the Americans are fixed on Asia today. They realize that the victory of the Chinese revolution has almost swept away the influence of the United States in the Far East. In Korea, the United States has had to face defeat. But despite these shameful failures, the United States is still trying to dominate the whole of Asia. This explains why the United States is establishing military bases everywhere and constantly sending special envoys and arbitrators to Asian countries. This explains why the United States wants to make Japan its military base in the Far East, why it wants to attack China after completely controlling Japan, and undermine the democratic movements in other parts of Asia. This explains why the draft peace treaty with Japan stipulates that the U.S. troops are allowed to continue to stay in Japan and that the plan to rearm Japan continues."

The newspapers unanimously indignantly pointed out the conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists to exclude the People's Republic of China from participating in the discussions on the peace treaty with Japan.

*The Free Press Journal's* editorial on the 27th wrote: "The Soviet Union, India, and other Southeast Asian countries hope that Beijing can send representatives to attend the San Francisco conference. The United States firmly opposed this suggestion. In this way, the Chinese people, who fought against Japan for the longest time and suffered the most from Japanese militarism, are excluded and cannot participate in the conference." The editorial said: "This is an unreasonable decision." The editorial pointed out: "This exposes the fraudulent nature of the treaty to be signed in San Francisco. Since China does not participate in the conference, and India does not participate in the discussions, the draft treaty can only be regarded as the United States forcing its conditions on the Asian people. The United States originally hoped that India could at least participate in the conference to make the conference look like something. India is unwilling to comply with the United States. India cannot abandon its determination to judge every issue from the perspective of right and wrong in order to gain the favor of the United States, and whether the favor of the United States is beneficial to India is doubtful. Therefore, India has reserved its right to discuss the Japanese issue at a later stage. India has also maintained its good faith with New China."

The New Delhi English daily, *The Indian News Chronicle*, wrote on the 25th: "India has consistently believed over the past two years that there will be no stability or progress in Southeast Asia unless New China is not only formally recognized, but also given the important position it deserves in dealing with Southeast Asian issues. A peace settlement with Japan that excludes New China cannot consolidate peaceful relations; on the contrary, it will only increase tension."

The Delhi Urdu daily, *Tez* (Vigor), wrote on the 27th: "India has made it clear that any peace treaty with Japan without China's participation is meaningless. The United States has ignored India's opinion. Therefore, India has refused to participate in the conference held to sign the peace treaty with Japan."

### 印度各报抨击美国对日和约草案  指出美制和约旨在复活日本军国主义进行侵略  印度人民将与全世界人民一道击败美国的阴谋

　　印度各报抨击美国对日和约草案
    指出美制和约旨在复活日本军国主义进行侵略
    印度人民将与全世界人民一道击败美国的阴谋
    【新华社新德里二十九日电】印度各地报纸纷纷发表评论，反对美国对日和约草案的侵略阴谋，斥责美国排斥中国参加对日和约，并指出印度拒绝参加旧金山会议的意义。
    孟买英文报纸《自由新闻》于二十七日以《骗局》为题发表社论说：“现在这样的对日和约是一种挑衅行为。这种和约是欺骗日本和亚洲人民的东西。”
    勒克瑙印地文《新黎明周刊》于二十日号召它的读者举行集会和游行，并通过决议，以击败美帝国主义对中华人民共和国和亚洲和平的阴谋。
    加尔各答孟加拉文报纸《自由报》以《击败美国在日本的阴谋》为题发表社论说：“让全印度人民喊出他们反对战争条约草案的大无畏的决心吧！让印度人民通过集会、示威、决议和反对这个条约的群众签名运动来表示诚恳的和平信息和印度人民的愿望吧！让印度人民和全世界人民一道撕毁美英战争贩子的仆从在旧金山会议上投的不合法的票，并为奠定日本的真正和平而投票吧！”
    新德里英文日报《印度新闻纪事报》二十五日写道：“印度显然不能参加这种对日媾和，因为这只会使日本在将来的任何战争中不能不成为美国的附庸，而不能给日本以将有合理的持久前途的和平。”
    各报明白指出美国的草案不是媾和的草案，而是准备让日本军国主义以美国统治集团的盟友的资格，进行新侵略的战争草案。各报严词指责美国照会中所说的不能在旧金山会议上讨论和约，参加的人必须在美国统治者画的虚线上签字一节。
    例如，孟买《十字路》周刊于二十四日以《不要说话，只用签字》为题发表社论说：“尽管在上次大战中受到日本恐怖手段摧残的大多数国家表示反对，和约的主旨仍然是恢复日本军国主义。”“这个和约不但用来阻碍日本的自由与和平发展，而且足以使日本成为侵略中华人民共和国和苏联，并破坏一切亚洲国家的独立的基地。”社论斥责美国一意孤行说：“美国的厚颜和蛮横真是到了极点。”
    海得拉巴邦乌尔都文日报《传信报》二十四日写道：“美国人的眼睛今天钉在亚洲身上。他们认识到：中国革命的胜利差不多已把美国在远东的势力影响一扫而空。在朝鲜，美国不得不面临失败。但是尽管受到这些可耻的失败，美国仍在竭力想统治整个亚洲。这就说明为什么美国在各个地方建立军事基地，并不断派遣特使和仲裁人到亚洲各国。这就说明为什么美国想要使日本成为它在远东的军事基地，为什么它想在完全控制了日本之后进攻中国，并破坏亚洲其他地方的民主运动。这就说明为什么对日和约草案中规定允许美国军队继续留驻日本和重新武装日本的计划继续进行。”
    各报一致愤慨指出美帝国主义者排除中华人民共和国参加对日和约讨论的阴谋。
    《自由新闻》二十七日的社论写道：“苏联、印度及东南亚其他国家希望北京能派有代表出席旧金山会议。美国坚决反对这个建议。这样一来，与日本作战最久受日本军国主义的害最深的中国人民，受到排斥，不能参加和会。”社论说：“这是一个蛮横无理的决定。”社论指出：“这暴露了将要在旧金山签字的和约的欺诈性。既然中国不参加和会，印度也不参加讨论，和约草案只能算是美国把它的条件强迫亚洲人民接受。美国原希望印度至少能参加一下和会，使得和会象个样子。印度不愿意依从美国。印度不能为了获得美国的好感而放弃它从是非的观点判断每一问题的决心，而美国的好感对于印度是不是有益处还是可疑的。所以印度保留了它在以后的阶段讨论日本问题的权利。印度也与新中国保持了信义。”
    新德里英文日报《印度新闻纪事报》二十五日写道：“印度在过去两年来一贯认为，除非新中国不仅得到正式的承认，而且还给它以在处理东南亚问题上所应有的重要地位，否则东南亚是不会有稳定或进步的。新中国被排斥在外的对日媾和，并不能巩固和平的关系；正相反，它只有增加紧张。”
    德里乌尔都文日报《活力报》于二十七日写道：“印度已经明白指出：没有中国参加，任何对日和约都是毫无意义的。美国无视印度的这个意见。因此印度拒绝参加为签订对日和约而举行的和会。”
