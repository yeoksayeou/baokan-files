　　Hunan Xinhua Red Tea Factory and Hunan Tea Company
    Certain Responsible Cadres Illegally Harbor Landlords
    Local Leading Organs Should Immediately Conduct Rigorous Handling
    A Letter from the People's Government of the Twelfth District of Xinhua County:
    Comrade Editor:
    The leadership style of the Xinhua Red Tea Factory, affiliated with the Hunan Provincial Company of the China Tea Company, exhibits a serious tendency to be divorced from the masses. The factory has successively experienced incidents such as harboring landlords, encroaching on houses and property distributed to farmers, and insulting family members of revolutionary soldiers. We will now summarize the details of these matters, hoping that relevant parties will conduct rigorous handling.
    (1) Harboring landlords. Chen He'ang, a local tyrant and landlord in Yangmu Zhou Township, Xinhua County, served as the manager of a tea industry cooperative under the reactionary forces in the past, embezzling over 200 *shi* of farmers' shares. While serving as a primary school principal, he completely destroyed the school equipment and seized the farmers' pedestrian road. After the liberation of the area, Chen He'ang, the local tyrant and landlord, wormed his way into the Xinhua Red Tea Factory and became the head of the factory's business section. Local farmers have repeatedly demanded the settling of accounts for Chen He'ang's crimes; however, in February of this year, the factory transferred Chen He'ang to work in a tea factory far away.
    (2) Encroaching on the fruits of the Farmers' Association. Last year, the Farmers' Association of Yangmu Zhou Township in our district stored the belongings of fugitive landlords in the house of the big landlord Zeng Xianke, and affixed a seal of the Yangmu Zhou Township Farmers' Association. Without the consent of the Farmers' Association, the Xinhua Red Tea Factory secretly removed the seal. They moved some of the Farmers' Association's collection of leather suitcases and equipment in a scattered and disorderly manner; some disappeared, and some were distributed to the rooms of the factory staff members' families.
    (3) Insulting family members of revolutionary soldiers. On May 15th of this year, the mother of revolutionary soldier Liu Chunshan from Yangmu Zhou Township (a poor peasant, over sixty years old), wanted to earn some rice to survive by picking tea because her family had no rice to cook. When she took the tea-picking certificate to the tea factory, Lian Guanwu, a family member of factory employee Fan Chengyu, cursed loudly, saying, "You old thing, you can't pick tea at all!" and immediately ordered the armed guards to drag the revolutionary soldier's family member to the ground, leaving her unable to breathe.
    These acts of infringement on the interests of farmers by the Xinhua Red Tea Factory have aroused the dissatisfaction of the farmers in Yangmu Zhou Township. Chen Houssheng, the chairman of the Yangmu Zhou Township Farmers' Association, has repeatedly criticized the factory; however, the factory has not only failed to examine itself and humbly accept the opinions of the masses, but has also refused to do so. Fan Jinghuang, the head of the factory's personnel section, said with a threatening tone, "Our factory is full of county-level cadres, and the purchasing station personnel are all district-level cadres. Only the prefectural committee can manage us; your Farmers' Association is not qualified to give us opinions." In order to restrict criticism, the factory staff indicated that they would prohibit rural cadres from entering the factory.
             People's Government of the Twelfth District of Xinhua County, Hunan
    The Investigation and Opinions of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shaoyang Prefectural Committee of the CPC on the Incident (Summary) Comrade Editor:
    Regarding the Xinhua Red Tea Factory's employment of landlord elements and other issues, we would like to inform you of the situation we have learned from our investigation and our opinions.
    (1) The issue of harboring landlords. Chen He'ang is indeed a middle landlord and has engaged in tyrannical behavior. He went to the Xinhua Red Tea Factory in April last year as the head of the business section; in October last year, the Hunan Provincial Company of the China Tea Company transferred him to work at the Changsha Tea Factory. In February of this year, farmers requested the Xinhua Red Tea Factory to hand Chen He'ang over to the farmers for handling. In June, Chu Yuheng, the manager of the Hunan Provincial Company of the China Tea Company, obtained the consent of Ma Shoushan, the secretary of the Twelfth District Committee of the CPC in Xinhua County, to temporarily not transfer Chen back, so as not to affect the tea factory's business. Therefore, it does not constitute a harboring fact. However, in the thinking of the leading comrades of the tea factory, they did not take an active attitude of support and assistance towards the farmers' demands for struggle, as described in the letter.
    (2) The issue of encroaching on the fruits of the farmers. The statement in the letter is indeed a fact. In July of last year, Zhou Jingmin, the deputy director of the factory, moved his family members into the house of a fugitive landlord sealed up by the Farmers' Association without the permission of the Farmers' Association, and occupied some of the furniture. When the tea factory rented this house from the Farmers' Association in March of this year, all four rooms upstairs were piled with furniture. The tea factory used the excuse that "they had urged the Farmers' Association to move several times but it had not moved" (the Farmers' Association is also responsible for delaying the move), and in late March, factory director Wang Kun privately removed the Farmers' Association's seal and moved his family members in, occupying all the furniture in the house. After this incident occurred, the Farmers' Association raised its opinion to the tea factory, and the tea factory issued an IOU to the Farmers' Association.
    (3) The issue of insulting military dependents. Both the military dependent herself and Lian Guanwu, a staff member of the tea factory, were at fault. Liu Chunshan's mother, the revolutionary soldier, brought her granddaughter-in-law into the factory to pick tea and asked to move her seat from the dark place to the bright place. The guard Dai Qianwan asked them to leave because she changed her tea-picking seat and also discovered that they only had one tea-picking certificate for the two of them. Lian Guanwu, who was responsible for managing the tea-picking area, persuaded Liu Chunshan's mother to leave the area without success, and then hinted to comrade Dai Qianwan to drag her out.
    The Xinhua Red Tea Factory and the Yangmu Zhou Township Farmers' Association have had disputes with each other and have accused each other. In addition to the People's Government of the Twelfth District of Xinhua County raising these opinions to the tea factory, the tea factory also accused the Yangmu Zhou Township Farmers' Association to our office. In fact, both sides are at fault, and both sides must be responsible. The People's Government of the Twelfth District of Xinhua County did not conduct an in-depth investigation and only listened to the reflections of the township cadres and the Farmers' Association, which is inappropriate.
          Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shaoyang Prefectural Committee of the CPC
    Editor's Note: The investigation materials of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shaoyang Prefectural Committee of the CPC prove that the disclosure by the People's Government of the Twelfth District of Xinhua County and the local Yangmu Zhou Township Farmers' Association of the illegal and erroneous behavior of some cadres of the Xinhua Red Tea Factory are basically facts. However, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shaoyang Prefectural Committee of the CPC believes that this is a dispute between the two sides, "both sides are at fault, and both sides should be responsible"; obviously, this conclusion is wrong.
    First of all, we believe that the Xinhua Red Tea Factory has actually played a role in harboring the landlord Chen He'ang. The factory's unprincipled appointment of the landlord Chen He'ang as the head of the business section, and the subsequent perfunctory actions taken on this issue to appease the masses, all illustrate this point. Of course, according to the materials of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shaoyang Prefectural Committee of the CPC, Chu Yuheng, the manager of the Hunan Provincial Tea Company, and Ma Shoushan, the secretary of the Twelfth District Committee of the CPC in Xinhua County, are both largely responsible for this matter.
    Secondly, Wang Kun and Zhou Jingmin, the persons in charge of the Xinhua Red Tea Factory, arbitrarily occupied and forcibly rented the surplus houses of the landlords confiscated by the farmers without consulting the Farmers' Association, as well as the furniture confiscated with the houses, all of which violated the interests of the masses. It is correct for the Farmers' Association to raise its opinion to the tea factory.
    Thirdly, Lian Guanwu, an employee of the Xinhua Red Tea Factory, and the on-duty security personnel of the factory at the time, forcibly dragged the mother of the revolutionary soldier Liu Chunshan, who was picking tea, out of the factory. Their attitude was very bad and clearly wrong. The so-called "ineffective persuasion" cannot be used as an excuse for this bad attitude.
    The above facts show that some staff members of the Xinhua Red Tea Factory did not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves on the issue of dealing with the landlord Chen He'ang; they adopted an extremely bad attitude of coercion and command towards the masses. The People's Government of the Twelfth District of Xinhua County and the local Yangmu Zhou Township Farmers' Association are completely correct in criticizing and accusing the Xinhua Red Tea Factory's bad style and illegal behavior in order to implement government decrees and protect the interests of the masses. It is hoped that the Shaoyang Special Office and the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shaoyang Prefectural Committee of the CPC will further study this incident and conduct rigorous handling.

### 湖南新化红茶厂及湖南茶叶公司  某些负责干部竟违法包庇地主  当地领导机关应即进行严正处理

　　湖南新化红茶厂及湖南茶叶公司
    某些负责干部竟违法包庇地主
    当地领导机关应即进行严正处理
    新化县第十二区人民政府的来信编辑同志：
    中国茶叶公司湖南省公司所属新化红茶厂的领导作风上存在着严重脱离群众的倾向，在该厂曾先后发生了包庇地主、侵占农民分得的房产财物，及侮辱革命军人家属等事件。现在将这些事情的经过摘要说明如下，希望有关方面进行严正处理。
    （一）包庇地主。新化县杨木洲乡恶霸地主陈鹤昂，过去在反动派手下当过茶业合作社经理，吞吃农民股本二百多石。他在当小学校长时，又把校具完全破坏，并霸占农民的行人大路。该地解放后，恶霸地主陈鹤昂即钻进新化红茶厂，当了该厂的业务股长。当地农民几次要求清算陈鹤昂的罪恶；但在今年二月间，该厂却把陈鹤昂调到很远的茶厂去工作。
    （二）侵占农会果实。我区杨木洲乡农会曾于去年把逃亡地主的东西，收藏在大地主曾显科屋内，并贴有杨木洲乡农会的封条。新化红茶厂不经农会同意，不知在什么时候就把封条撕掉了。他们并把农会收藏的一些皮箱、器具，搬得七零八落，有的就不见了，有的就分散到该厂职员眷属的房间里去了。
    （三）侮辱革命军人家属。今年五月十五日，杨木洲乡革命军人刘春山的母亲（贫农，年纪六十多岁），因家里没米煮饭，想靠拣茶赚点米来度日，当她拿了采茶证走到茶厂时，茶厂职员范承毓的眷属练冠吾开口大骂说：“你这老家伙根本就拣不得茶！”并马上指挥武装卫兵把这个革命军人家属拖倒在地上，连气都透不过来。
    新化红茶厂所发生的这些侵犯农民利益的事情，引起了杨木洲乡农民的不满。杨木洲乡农会主席陈厚生曾几次对该厂提出批评；但该厂不但不检讨自己，虚心接受群众的意见，反而表示拒绝。该厂人事股长范景煌，带着威胁的口吻说：“我们厂内都是县级干部，收购站人员都是区级干部，只有地委才能管得我们，你们农会没有资格向我们提意见。”为了限制批评，该厂职员就表示要禁止乡村干部入厂。
             湖南新化县第十二区人民政府
  中共邵阳地委纪律检查委员会对事件的调查及意见（摘要）编辑同志：
    关于新化红茶厂任用地主分子等问题，现将我们调查所了解的情况和意见告诉你们。
    （一）包庇地主问题。陈鹤昂确系一个中等地主，并有恶霸行为。去年四月他到新化红茶厂任业务股长；去年十月，中国茶叶公司湖南省公司将他调至长沙茶厂工作。今年二月农民要求新化红茶厂将陈鹤昂交农民处理。六月，中国茶叶公司湖南省公司经理褚玉衡取得中共新化县第十二区委员会书记马寿山的同意，暂不将陈调回，以免影响茶厂业务。因此，不成为包庇事实。但在该茶厂领导同志的思想上，对农民的斗争要求，确实是来信所述没有采取积极支持与协助的态度。
    （二）侵占农民果实问题。来信所述，确系事实。去年七月间，该厂副厂长周靖民未经农会允许，私自将眷属搬进被农会查封的逃亡地主屋内居住，并占用了一部分家具。今年三月，茶厂向农会租用这所房子时，楼上四间房子都堆有家具。茶厂以“催促过农会几次未搬”为借口（农会拖延未搬也得负责），即于三月底由该厂厂长王坤私自启去农会的封条，将眷属搬进，并占用了这屋内的全套家具。这件事发生后，农会向茶厂提出意见，茶厂向农会开具了借条。
    （三）侮辱军属问题。军属本人与茶厂工作人员练冠吾两方都有错误。革命军人刘春山母亲携带她的孙媳妇进场拣茶，并要求将座位从黑处移到亮处。护厂战士戴前万因她调换拣茶座位，同时又发现她们两人只有一个拣茶证，所以就要她们出去。负责管理拣茶场的练冠吾劝说刘春山的母亲出场无效，即暗示戴前万同志将她拖了出去。
    新化红茶厂与杨木洲乡农会互闹纠纷，互相控告。除新化县十二区人民政府向茶厂提出了这些意见之外，茶厂方面也曾向我处控告过杨木洲乡农会。实际上两方都有错误，两方都得负责。新化县十二区人民政府未深入调查，单听取乡干部和农会一方面的反映，这是不妥当的。
          中共邵阳地委纪律检查委员会
    编者按：中共邵阳地委纪律检查委员会的调查材料，证明了新化县十二区人民政府及当地杨木洲乡农会所揭发新化红茶厂的一些干部的违法及错误行为，基本上都是事实。但是，中共邵阳地委纪律检查委员会，却认为这是两方互闹纠纷，“两方都有错误，两方都应负责”；很明显，这个结论是错了的。
    首先，我们认为，新化红茶厂对待地主陈鹤昂，实际上是起了包庇作用。该厂无原则地任用地主陈鹤昂为业务股长，以及以后在这个问题上所采取的敷衍搪塞群众的行动，都说明了这一点。当然，按中共邵阳地委纪律检查委员会的材料，湖南省茶叶公司经理褚玉衡以及中共新化县第十二区委员会书记马寿山，对这件事都负有重要责任。
    其次，新化红茶厂的负责人王坤、周靖民，不征求农会同意，随便私自占用以及强租强借农民所没收的地主多余房屋、以及随房没收的家具等物，都是侵犯了群众利益的。农会向茶厂提出意见，是正确的。
    第三，新化红茶厂职员练冠吾及该厂当时值班警卫人员，强拖拣茶者——革命军人刘春山的母亲出厂，态度十分恶劣，显然是错误的。所谓“解劝无效”，并不能成为这种恶劣态度的借口。
    以上事实说明：新化红茶厂的某些工作人员，在对待地主陈鹤昂这个问题上，是敌我不分的；对待群众是采取了极端恶劣的强迫命令的态度的。新化县第十二区人民政府及当地杨木洲乡农会，为了贯彻政府法令、保护群众利益，对新化红茶厂的恶劣作风、违法行为进行批评、控告，是完全正确的。希望邵阳专署及中共邵阳地委纪律检查委员会，进一步研究这个事件，并进行严正处理。
