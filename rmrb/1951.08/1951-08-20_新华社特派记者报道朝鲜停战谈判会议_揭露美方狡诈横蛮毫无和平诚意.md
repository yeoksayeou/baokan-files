　　Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Reports on Korean Armistice Talks
    Exposing US Cunning, Tyranny, and Complete Lack of Sincerity for Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 19th] This agency's special correspondent reports: The Korean armistice talks in the past few days have not made any progress due to the US negotiating representatives' stubborn insistence on the unreasonable demand to establish the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone north of the 38th parallel, deep within our positions. The US representatives' statements at the meeting clearly demonstrate the US side's cunning, tyranny, and complete lack of sincerity for peace.

    More than a week ago, after we exposed to the world the US side's arrogant demands regarding the military demarcation line, the US side, in a panic, refused to attend the meeting on the pretext of delaying the negotiations and re-arranging its conspiracy plan. After the armistice talks resumed on August 10, the US representatives repeatedly vaguely stated at the meeting that "the United Nations Command's suggestion is that the military demarcation line should be based on the current battle line," and that they were "willing to discuss the proposed adjustments." At the meeting on the 12th, our representative sternly accused the US representatives of attempting to conceal the truth of the US proposal and deceive the people of the world, and demanded a direct answer from the US side.

    The US representatives' subsequent statements completely exposed the US side's true face of playing tricks and deception.

    General Nam Il questioned the US side: Why did the United Nations Command's communique on August 10 say that the United Nations Command's suggestion was based on the combat area, while in fact the military demarcation line in this suggestion was clearly within the defensive line of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers? US representative Joy replied at the meeting on the 13th: "The words in the communique are correct. The communique did not say that the possible military demarcation line is consistent with the battle line. The communique said that the possible military demarcation line is within the battle line area. This distinction is very obvious. You say that this demarcation line is within your battle line, which is also correct." Joy also said: "Whenever you use terms like 'based on the battle line' or 'based on the current battle line,' you do not understand the meaning of this term. The correct meaning of this term is 'based on the current combat positions and the overall military situation,' or 'based on the current combat positions and the entire actual military situation.'" This clearly shows that the US side is playing with words in an attempt to deceive world opinion. Joy revealed what he was playing with words for when he continued to explain the meaning of what he said above. He said: "I have never wanted to hide the fact that the military demarcation line of the demilitarized zone proposed by our side is north of the current ground combat position." "In simple terms, our side believes that the current combat position should be the starting position. We then determine the demilitarized zone and the military demarcation line it causes to advance northward, to ensure that our defensive positions have sufficient depth."

    From these words, people can clearly see that the US side's so-called military demarcation line "based on the current battle line" is to establish the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone within our positions; the US side's so-called "adjustment" is the "adjustment" within this area delineated by the US side, that is, the "adjustment" within our positions. The US side's purpose in playing with word games is to conceal its arrogant demand to force the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw north, in order to further plunder 12,000 square kilometers of Korean territory.

    In order to achieve this aggressive demand, the US side does not hesitate to use its unique "military logic" to defend itself. In the past few days, the US representatives have used this "military logic" at the meeting to such a confused extent that contradictions abound, further exposing the US side's tyranny.

    People know that one of the reasons the US side gave for demanding the establishment of the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone in our positions north of the 38th parallel was that the United Nations Command has naval and air force superiority and should therefore be compensated on the ground. This "military logic" has been sternly refuted by our representative. Our side pointed out that the reason why the US military can maintain the current battle line is the result of the joint operations of all its land, sea, and air military forces, and there is no "independent" naval and air force superiority. After this "military logic" was exposed, the US representatives hurriedly patched up this "military logic." On the one hand, the US representatives still repeated that the US side has naval and air force superiority and should be compensated; on the other hand, they said that once the armistice is realized, the US side will not be able to use this naval and air force superiority, so the Chinese and Korean armies are superior to the US ground forces, so the US side should also be compensated. US representative Joy's statements at the meetings on the 14th and 15th were based on this absurd "military logic."

    Joy said: "The current battle line position of the United Nations ground forces is caused by the action of our ground forces combined with a part of our naval and air force. The rest of our naval and air force strength is used for other military missions, which has an indirect and temporarily invisible effect on the position of the ground battle line. I am referring here specifically to our air strikes against your important military industries, against your rear training areas and training institutions, and against your transportation hubs and routes." Joy divided the US naval and air force superiority into two parts, namely, tactical bombing and strategic bombing. Joy especially emphasized strategic bombing, and he unscrupulously flaunted the US side's indiscriminate bombing in the meeting. He said: "Your railway and highway systems are constantly subjected to United Nations air strikes, and the United Nations Navy does not allow you to use the ocean, blockading your coastal roads. Your personnel, supplies, and equipment are often likely to be destroyed on the way to the front line." Joy attempted to use this strategic bombing to scare the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, to force the Chinese and Korean People's Armies to submit to the US side's unreasonable demand to establish the military demarcation line in our positions.

    But Joy could not justify himself. People all over the world know that: First, without the "superiority" of the US Navy and Air Force, the US military would have been unable to maintain the current battle line, and we would have liberated the whole of Korea long ago. Second, even with the support of the Navy and Air Force, the US military still had to retreat to the southeast corner of Korea in August last year, and still had to retreat south of the Han River in January this year. It can be seen that the US Navy and Air Force not only cannot push the current battle line north, but also cannot prevent it from retreating south. Third, the US Navy and Air Force's indiscriminate bombing of peaceful residents in North Korea is only a crime that should be judged by international justice. If this inhumane massacre of peaceful residents should be "compensated," then shouldn't Hitler be given the greatest "compensation"?

    Joy also said: "During the armistice, the naval and air forces of the United Nations Command will cease their activities, thus giving you time to restore and gather the offensive potential of your ground forces without material interference. With this new force, you will be able to quickly overwhelm the United Nations ground forces, which you say are only barely, temporarily, and insecurely holding the current positions." Joy said arrogantly based on this "logic": "The United Nations recognizes this increasing ability of yours, so it must ensure that its ground positions during the armistice are sufficient to offset the benefits you gain from the withdrawal of our naval and air forces." That is to say, the US side believes that the US military is weaker than the Chinese and Korean armies after the armistice is realized, so the military demarcation line should be drawn north of the 38th parallel, deep within our positions.

    People see an absurd "logic" here: regardless of whether I have an advantage or a disadvantage, anyway, I want you to "compensate." This is the US side's tyrannical and unreasonable attitude regarding the establishment of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. If according to this "logic" of the US side, our side can fully demand that the military demarcation line be established on the Han River, because our quite powerful air force and mechanized troops have not been fully used on the battlefield; our side can also fully demand that the military demarcation line be established on the Nakdong River, because in the vast area south of the Han River, Korean people's guerrillas are fighting; our side can even demand that the military demarcation line be drawn far to the south outside the Korean Peninsula, because once the US naval and air forces still remain in these places, they can attack northern Korea and even Chinese territory north of the Yalu River.

    Joy issued a statement on the 18th saying: "The primary task of every military commander is to ensure the safety of his troops at all times. This is an extremely important and inescapable obligation that every military commander must not neglect." "We have a sacred duty to our soldiers to ensure their maximum safety during the armistice." "We must maintain defensive positions." If this argument can be used to defend the US side's aggressive demand to occupy positions in northern Korea, then isn't this argument even more able to prove that our side's demand that the US land, air, and naval forces must all retreat to the south of the Korean Peninsula is reasonable? Obviously, why shouldn't the army of invaded Korea be guaranteed the maximum degree of safety? Why shouldn't invaded Korea maintain defensive positions on Korean soil, while the US invading army has the nerve to come to northern Korea to demand "defensive positions"? However, our representatives did not do so, because our side believes that the current balance of all military forces on both sides of the Korean battlefield is tending toward equilibrium on the 38th parallel, and the 38th parallel is the fairest and most reasonable military demarcation line. The US side's demand to establish the military demarcation line in our positions under the pretext that the US military should have sufficient defensive positions after the armistice, in addition to deliberately slandering our side as "aggression," this "logic" is untenable. Ridgway, as the commander-in-chief of the United Nations Command, slapped himself in the face in his conversation on the 14th. On the one hand, he said that the US side should have a "defensible" line in Korea, on the other hand, he said: in the event of a breakdown in the armistice negotiations, once the Chinese and Korean People's Armies launch an offensive, it is impossible for the US side "not to lose land at the outset," and he emphasized that "land is always secondary." This means that even in the case where the US side is still constantly using its so-called "naval and air force superiority," even if the defensive line currently held by the US military is "a defensible line" as Ridgway said, Ridgway has no assurance that he will not be defeated and retreat. Therefore, the fact is very clear that the US side's so-called "based on the current battle line" and "to ensure that the US military has a defensible line" is only an attempt to seize 12,000 square kilometers of Korean land at the negotiating table in Kaesong that it cannot currently obtain on the battlefield with all its land, sea, and air forces.

    None of the US side's "military logic" can justify the US side's aggressive policy, nor can it conceal the US side's tyrannical unreasonableness and extremely arrogant demand to establish the military demarcation line in our positions north of the 38th parallel. Because the US side has consistently insisted on this demand, the discussion on the issue of the military demarcation line at the Korean armistice talks since July 27 has made no progress. Although the two sides have now agreed to establish a joint group to discuss the establishment of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, if the US side still stubbornly insists on its unreasonable and predatory demands and refuses our fair and reasonable plan, an agreement is still impossible.

　　新华社特派记者报道朝鲜停战谈判会议
    揭露美方狡诈横蛮毫无和平诚意
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者报道：几天来的朝鲜停战谈判会议，由于美方谈判代表固执地坚持将军事分界线和非军事地区建立在三八线以北深入我方阵地内的无理要求，仍未获得任何进展。美方代表在会上的发言，明白地显示了美方狡诈、横蛮，毫无和平诚意。
    一个多星期以前，当我方向全世界揭露了美方关于军事分界线的狂妄主张之后，美方于慌乱之余，借故拒绝出席会议，以拖延谈判，并重新布置其阴谋计划。在停战谈判于八月十日恢复以后，美方代表就一再在会上含糊其词地说什么“联合国军的建议是军事分界线应以目前战线为基础”，并说什么“愿意讨论建议中的调整”。我方代表曾在十二日的会议上，严词指责美方代表的所为旨在蒙蔽美方建议的真相，欺骗世界人民，并要求美方作正面答复。
    美方代表在后来的发言，完全暴露了美方玩弄手段、欺骗狡诈的真面目。
    南日将军曾质问美方说：为什么八月十日联合国军的公报说联合国军的建议是以作战地区为基础，而实际上这个建议中的军事分界线显然是在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军防守的战线以内呢？美方代表乔埃在十三日的会议上回答说：“公报里的话是正确的。公报并没有说可能的军事分界线是和战线一致的。公报说，可能的军事分界线是在战线地区以内。这种分别是十分明显的。你们说这道分界线是在你方战线以内也是正确的。”乔埃又说：“每当你用‘以战线为基础’或‘以目前战线为基础’这种词句时，你没有了解这个词句。这个词句的正确涵义是‘以目前的作战阵地和全面军事情况为基础’，或者是‘以目前作战阵地和整个实际军事情况为基础’。”这就明显地表明美方正玩弄文字，企图蒙蔽世界舆论。乔埃在继续解释他上面所说的话的意义时，露出了他玩弄文字为的是什么。他说：“我从来没有想隐瞒我方所提出的非军事地区的军事分界线是在目前地面战斗阵地以北。”“用简单的话来说，我方认为目前战斗阵地应为开始的阵地。我们然后确定非军事地区和它所引起的向北方推进的军事分界线，以保证我方防御阵地有充分的深度。”
    人们从这些话中可以清楚地看到：美方的所谓军事分界线“以目前战线为基础”，就是要把军事分界线和非军事地区建立在我方阵地内；美方所谓“调整”，就是在美方所划定的这个地区内的“调整”，亦即在我方阵地以内的“调整”。美方之所以玩弄文字把戏，其目的在于掩饰其强令朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军向北撤退，以达到进一步掠夺一万二千方公里朝鲜领土的狂妄要求。
    美方为达到这种侵略性的要求，不惜以其特有的“军事逻辑”来辩解。几天来美方代表在会议上运用这种“军事逻辑”已达到如此混乱，以致矛盾百出，越发暴露美方的横蛮。
    人们知道，美方为要求把军事分界线和非军事地区建立在三八线以北我方阵地内，曾举出其理由之一是联合国军拥有海空军优势，因此应在地面上得到补偿。这种“军事逻辑”曾受到我方代表的严正驳斥。我方指出：美军之所以能够保持现有战线，是其陆海空军全部军事力量联合作战的结果，并没有什么“独立的”海空军优势。当这个“军事逻辑”被戳破后，美方代表又慌忙为这种“军事逻辑”作缀补。美方代表一方面依然重复美方有海空军优势，应得到补偿；另一方面又说一旦停战后美方就不能使用这种海空军优势，因而中朝军队就比美方地面部队占优势，所以美方也应得到补偿。美方代表乔埃在十四日和十五日会议上的发言，就是根据这种荒谬的“军事逻辑”的。
    乔埃说：“目前联合国地面部队的战线位置，是由我方的地面部队结合我们一部分海空军的行动而造成的。我们其余的海空军力量用于别的军事任务，对于地面战线的位置有着间接和暂时看不出来的效果。我这里特别指的是我们对你们重要的军事工业、对你们后方的训练地区和训练机构、对你们的交通运输中心和路线的空中袭击。”乔埃就是这样的把美方的海空军优势分为两部分，即一部分是战术轰炸，另一部分是战略轰炸。乔埃特别强调战略轰炸，他肆无惮忌地在会议中炫耀美方的狂轰滥炸。他说：“你们的铁路和公路系统经常地受到联合国的空中袭击，联合国的海军不许你们利用海洋，封锁了你们沿海的道路。你们的人员、供应和装备在开赴前线途中经常有被毁灭的可能。”乔埃企图用这种战略轰炸来吓唬中朝人民军队，要中朝人民军队屈从美方关于把军事分界线确立在我方阵地内的无理要求。
    但是乔埃是不能自圆其说的。全世界的人们都知道：第一，没有美国海空军的“优势”，美军早已不能维持目前的战线了，我方早已解放全朝鲜了。第二，即令依靠了海空军的撑持，美国军队在去年八月仍然不能不退到朝鲜的东南角，在今年一月仍然不能不退到汉江以南。由此可见美国海空军不但不能把目前的战线往北推，而且也不能阻止它向南退。第三，美国海空军对朝鲜北部和平居民的狂轰滥炸，只是一种应当受到国际正义裁判的罪行。如果这种对于和平居民的无人性的屠杀还应该得到“补偿”，那么希特勒不是应该得到最大的“补偿”了吗？
    乔埃又说：“在停战期间，联合国军的海空部队将停止他们的活动，因而使你们有时间来恢复和集结你方地面部队的进攻潜力，而不受到物质上的干涉。你方有了这种新的兵力之后，就能够迅速压倒你们所说的只是勉强、暂时而且不稳固地守着目前阵地的联合国军的地面部队。”乔埃就根据这种“逻辑”，专横地说：“联合国认识到你们这种日渐增加的能力，因此必须保证在停战期间它的地面阵地足以抵消由于我们的海空军撤退而使你们获得的利益。”这就是说，美方认为停战实现后美军比中朝军队弱，因此要求军事分界线应划在三八线以北深入我方阵地内。
    人们从这里看到一种荒诞的“逻辑”：不管我优势也罢，劣势也罢，反正我要你“补偿”。这就是美方关于建立军事分界线和非军事区的横蛮无理的态度。如果按照美方这种“逻辑”，我方尽可以要求把军事分界线建立在汉江，因为我方相当强大的空军和机械化部队尚未充分使用在战场上；我方也尽可以要求把军事分界线建立在洛东江，因为在汉江以南的广大地区内，有朝鲜人民游击队在作战；我方甚至可以要求把军事分界线划在朝鲜半岛以外的南方很远的地方，因为美国的海空军一旦仍然留在这些地方，就可以对朝鲜北部甚至鸭绿江以北中国领土进行袭击。
    乔埃在十八日发表声明说：“每一个军事指挥官的首要任务就是时时刻刻保证他的军队的安全。这是每一个军事指挥官决不可忽视的异常重要的责无旁贷的义务。”“我们对我们的战士有神圣的义务使他们在停战期间得到最大程度的安全。”“我们必须保持防御阵地。”如果这种论证居然能够用来辩护美方占领朝鲜北部阵地的侵略要求的话，那么，这种论证不是更能够用来证明我方要求美国陆空海军必须一起退到朝鲜半岛以南是合理的吗？很明显，为什么被侵略的朝鲜的军队不应该得到最大程度的安全的保证？为什么被侵略的朝鲜不应该在朝鲜的土地上保持防御阵地，而美国侵略军反而有脸皮到朝鲜北部来要求“防御阵地”？但是，我方代表并没有这样做，因为我方认为目前朝鲜战场上双方全部军事力量在三八线上趋于平衡，三八线是最公平合理的军事分界线。美方以停战后美军应有充分的防御阵地为借口而要求把军事分界线建立在我方阵地内，除了蓄意污蔑我方为“侵略”外，这种“逻辑”是站不住脚的。作为联合国军总司令的李奇微在十四日的谈话中就自己打自己的嘴巴。他一方面说美方要求在朝鲜应有一条“能够防守的”防线，另一方面又说：在停战谈判破裂的情况下，一旦中朝人民军队发动攻势，美方“一上来不失掉土地”是不可能的，他着重说“土地始终是次要的”。这就是说，即使在美方仍然在不断使用其所谓“海空军优势”的情况下，即使美军现时据守的防线如李奇微所说的是“一条可防守的线”，李奇微也没有把握说不会败退。因此，事实很明显，美方所谓“以目前战线为基础”、“要保证美军有一条可以防守的线”，其用意仅仅是企图在开城谈判会议的桌子上攫取它目前用全部陆海空军力量在战场上不能获得的一万二千平方公里的朝鲜土地。
    美方的所有“军事逻辑”，丝毫也不能为美方的侵略政策辩解，丝毫也不能掩饰美方的横蛮无理、狂妄绝顶的把军事分界线建立在三八线以北深入我方阵地内的要求。由于美方一直坚持这个要求，朝鲜停战谈判会议自七月二十七日以来关于军事分界线问题的讨论，即毫无进展。目前双方虽已同意成立一联合小组来讨论建立军事分界线和非军事地区问题，但是，如果美方仍固执其无理的掠夺性的要求，拒绝我方的公平合理的方案，协议仍然是不可能的。
