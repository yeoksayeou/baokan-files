[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee and the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee held a joint meeting on the 11th, presided over by Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Municipal Consultative Committee. The main agenda of the meeting was to discuss and decide on issues such as extending the term of office of the representatives of the First People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the urban districts of the city, the election of the People's Governments of the districts in the city, and the handling of counter-revolutionary cases.

The meeting first discussed the issue of extending the term of office of the representatives of the First People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the urban districts and the issue of electing the district people's governments. Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu explained: The First People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in the urban districts of the city were convened successively from May to September last year. The trial implementation has been very successful and should be institutionalized. According to regulations, the term of office of the representatives is one year. Some should have been re-elected earlier, and some will soon need to be re-elected. However, since it is to be institutionalized, the time for convening meetings in each district in the same city needs to be consistent. Secondly, it is best to hold the elections for the Municipal and District People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in the same period in the future, which will be of great benefit to the people and the work of the two levels of representative conferences. Based on these two reasons, we are asking everyone to discuss extending the term of office of the representatives of the First People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in the urban districts to December this year, and then re-elect the representatives at that time. Chairman Peng Zhen then pointed out: Having the elections for the Municipal and District People's Representative Conferences of All Circles at the same time can allow the people to raise their hands several times in one election meeting and elect several types of representatives separately. This saves the people's time and energy, improves the government's work efficiency, and does not harm the people's democratic system. Fixing all elections to be held in one period, and ensuring they are held at that time, allows both the people and the government to have a plan. This is also a strong guarantee for the institutionalization of the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles. At the meeting, Municipal Consultative Committee members Zhang Hongshun, Feng Peizhi, Zeng Zhaolun, Fu Huating, Gu Qizong, and others spoke successively, unanimously agreeing with Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu's report and Chairman Peng Zhen's opinions.

After discussion, the meeting decided that the term of office of the representatives of the First People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in the urban districts would be extended to December this year. In the future, the representatives of the Municipal and District People's Representative Conferences of All Circles will be elected simultaneously every December. The meeting also authorized the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in the urban and suburban districts to immediately exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congresses of All Circles and elect the District People's Governments. It was also stipulated that the District People's Governments of all urban districts must be elected by August.

Subsequently, Feng Jiping, Deputy Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, reported on the recent situation of clearing up counter-revolutionary cases. Deputy Director Feng said: Since the end of May, the Public Security Bureau has cleared up another 434 cases. The focus of the clearing was on those with heinous crimes who must be sentenced to death or imprisonment. The vast majority of these cases that we have tried and closed have been consulted with the people separately. The opinions of the masses and our original judgments are largely consistent, and many materials have been supplemented and corrected. Now, our Public Security Bureau has brought these case files and preliminary handling opinions to the joint meeting for everyone to discuss. Municipal Government Committee members Zheng Yun, Li Guorui, and Municipal Consultative Committee members Chen Mingde, Xu Deheng, and others expressed their opinions, praising the work achievements of the capital's public security personnel and agreeing with the methods and steps taken by the Public Security Bureau in handling counter-revolutionary cases. Committee member Li Guorui and others also suggested that the Municipal People's Government commend and reward these meritorious public security personnel. Chairman Peng Zhen, in his summary, expressed his agreement with everyone's opinions. The specific methods for commendation and reward will be decided after the Municipal People's Government studies them.

Finally, the attending consultative committee members and government committee members were divided into eight groups to review more than 400 counter-revolutionary case files separately. After careful review and discussion, everyone agreed with the Public Security Bureau's handling of counter-revolutionary cases in the vast majority of cases. After exchanging views on individual cases, it was decided to hand them over to the Public Security Bureau for further study and handling.

　　京市协商委员会和政府委员会昨举行联席会议
    授权城、郊各区各界人民代表会议选举区人民政府
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市第三届各界人民代表会议协商委员会和北京市人民政府委员会，十一日举行联席会议，由市协商委员会主席彭真主持。会议主要议题是：讨论和决定关于本市城区各区第一届各界人民代表会议代表延长任期；关于本市各区人民政府的选举和关于处理反革命案件等问题。
    会议首先讨论关于城区各区第一届各界人民代表会议代表任期延长的问题和关于选举区人民政府的问题。张友渔副市长说明：本市城区各区第一届各界人民代表会议是分别在去年五月到九月先后召开的，试行到现在，成绩很好，应该把它制度化。按照规定：代表的任期是一年；有的早应该改选了，有的很快也就该改选。但是，既然要制度化，在同一个市里，各区召开会议的时间就需要一致起来才好。其次，今后市、区两级各界人民代表会议的选举，最好能在同一时期举行，对于人民和两级代表会议的工作会有很多好处。根据这两个理由，我们提请大家讨论，把城区各区第一届各界人民代表会议的代表任期一律延长到今年十二月，到那时候，再改选代表。彭真主席接着指出：选举市、区两级各界人民代表会议代表的时间一致，可以使人民在一个选举会上，先后举几次手，就分别选出了几种代表。这样，既节约了人民的时间和精力，提高了政府的工作效率，又不会伤损人民的民主制度。把所有的选举，固定在一个时期举行，到时候就一定举行。这样，使人民和政府，都好有个计划；对于各界人民代表会议的制度化，也是一种有力的保证。会上，市协商委员会委员张鸿舜、冯佩之、曾昭抡、傅华亭、古奇踪等相继发言，一致同意张友渔副市长的报告和彭真主席的意见。
    经过讨论，会议即决定：城区各区第一届各界人民代表会议的代表任期，一律延长到今年十二月。以后，在每年十二月，同时选举市、区两级各界人民代表会议的代表。会议还授权城、郊各区各界人民代表会议，立即代行各界人民代表大会职权，选举区人民政府；并规定城区各区的区人民政府，一律在八月份以内选举出来。
    接着由市公安局冯基平副局长报告最近清理反革命案件的情况。冯副局长说：从五月底到现在，公安局又清理出四百三十四案。清理的步骤是着重罪大恶极，须判处死刑和徒刑的。我们审讯结案的这些案件，绝大部分已经分别向人民征询了意见。群众的意见和我们的原判，绝大部分是一致的；而且还补充和校正了很多材料。现在，我们公安局把这些案卷和初步处理意见，都带到联席会上来了，请大家讨论。市人民政府委员会委员郑芸、李国瑞、市协商委员会委员陈铭德、许德珩等纷纷发表意见，称赞首都公安人员的工作成绩，同意公安局处理反革命案件的方法和步骤。李国瑞委员等并建议市人民政府表扬和嘉奖这些有功的公安工作人员。彭真主席在总结时，表示同意大家的意见。关于表扬和嘉奖的具体办法，交市人民政府研究后决定。
    最后，到会的协商委员和政府委员分成八个小组，分别审查了反革命案卷四百多份。经过认真审查讨论，大家对公安局处理反革命的意见，绝大部分是同意的；个别的案件，经大家交换意见后，决定交公安局再加研究处理。
