The Southwest region has completed its cotton advance purchase program, exceeding the planned amount by fifty percent. In the vast rural areas of the Southwest, cooperatives have not yet been established, so the advance purchase work was carried out by local people's governments in conjunction with the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation. Starting in June this year, local people's governments and the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation organized work teams to go deep into the countryside to conduct advance purchases. The China National Grain Corporation and the China National General Merchandise Corporation also transferred large quantities of grain, fertilizer, salt, and industrial products to cotton-producing areas to supply farmers. After understanding the rationale behind advance cotton sales, cotton farmers in various places enthusiastically sold their cotton to the state in advance. Guanghan County in western Sichuan originally planned to purchase 200,000 jin of cotton in advance, but one district in the county exceeded 200,000 jin in advance sales. When cotton farmers in Luhe and Dongyue Townships, famous cotton-producing areas in northern Sichuan's Shehong County, sold cotton in advance, they resolutely refused the down payment from the people's government, saying, "The people's government provided us with rations, seeds, and fertilizer for growing cotton, and also guided us in improving techniques and preventing pests. How could we ask for any down payment now?" Ethnic minority cotton farmers in the Southwest region also enthusiastically sold cotton to the state in advance, with ethnic minorities in the Pu'er Special Zone of Yunnan selling more than 7,000 dan of cotton in advance. Currently, farmers in various cotton-producing areas in the Southwest are launching campaigns to add fertilizer, control pests, and remove weeds, and they are also ensuring that they will grow cotton well so that they can deliver good cotton to the state in the future.

　　西南预购棉花完成
    超过计划百分之五十
    西南区预购棉花工作已经完成，预购量超过计划百分之五十。西南区广大农村尚未建立合作社，预购工作是由各地人民政府与中国花纱布公司进行的。今年六月份起，各地人民政府与中国花纱布公司便组织工作队深入农村进行预购。中国粮食公司、中国百货公司也调运大量粮食、肥料、食盐及工业品到产棉地区供应农民。各地棉农在了解了预售棉花的道理后，都踊跃地把棉花预售给国家。川西广汉县原计划预购棉花二十万斤，但该县一个区预售的棉花即超过二十万斤。川北著名产棉区射洪县陆合、东岳两乡棉农预售棉花时，坚决不要人民政府的定金，他们说：“我们种棉花，人民政府贷给口粮、种籽、肥料，还指导我们改进技术，防治害虫，现在我们那能要啥定金。”西南区少数民族棉农也踊跃预售棉花给国家，云南普洱专区少数民族预售的棉花达七千多担。现在西南各产棉区农民正展开加肥、治虫、除草运动，并保证一定把棉花种好，将来可以交好棉给国家。
