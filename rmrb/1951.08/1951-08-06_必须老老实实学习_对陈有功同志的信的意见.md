　　Must Learn Honestly
    ——Opinions on Comrade Chen Yougong's Letter
    Recently, our entire Preparation Office has been studying the People's Daily editorial of June 16, "Construction is Impossible Without Engineering Design," and various communications regarding the serious losses caused by blind construction without correct engineering design. These materials have had a great educational effect on us.
    Most comrades oppose Comrade Chen Yougong's views, but a few seem to agree with him. If this kind of thinking is not corrected immediately, we will suffer repeated defeats in basic construction work. In other words, the people's property will continue to suffer even more severe losses.
    Where exactly is Comrade Chen Yougong wrong?
    I think Comrade Chen Yougong has complacency, which will make us prisoners of the enemy ideologically and cause great losses to the people's revolutionary cause. Criticism and self-criticism are one of the important characteristics that distinguish the Communist Party from other political parties. Chairman Mao said that we have only completed the first step of the Long March. Comrade Chen Yougong seems to have forgotten this sentence. He began to tolerate shortcomings, thinking "we are enough." Shouldn't we expose this kind of muddled thinking? Comrade Chen Yougong also believes that "none of the leading cadres in various enterprises are not subjectively striving to do a good job in basic construction." But more importantly, Comrade Chen Yougong failed to notice that it is "being responsible to the people." Only looking at the motive and not the effect violates the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Being responsible cannot rely solely on good intentions, but must act according to the actual situation, consider the overall situation, act according to the rules, postpone preparations that are not mature, and rather not do things that are not certain. If you do it, do it well and carry it through to the end. The Central Committee's decision on basic construction investment requires us to be more responsible. We have many shortcomings in this regard, often being clueless and calculating insufficiently, resulting in waste of state and people's property!
    In our basic construction work, there are difficulties. As the People's Daily editorial pointed out: "Of course, with the existing conditions of our country, it is not without difficulties to carry out careful engineering design. We should admit that we still lack experience in basic construction, and there is a great lack of design personnel." But the question is how do we overcome these difficulties. A person armed with Marxism-Leninism will find all kinds of ways to go from darkness to light, from failure to victory.
    When Chairman Mao led the main force of the Red Army to northern Shaanxi in October 1935, the only industry in northern Shaanxi was a repair shop with dozens of people. By 1937, there were clothing, printing, papermaking, and oil pressing factories, with a total of more than 600 employees. In the autumn and winter of 1938, the Border Region Refugee Textile Factory and leather, papermaking, clothing, farm tool, and Eighth Route Army pharmaceutical factories were successively established. In 1939, Xinhua Chemical Plant, Guanghua Pharmaceutical Factory, and other textile, oil pressing, ceramics, and coal mining factories were successively established. In 1942, the number of factories had increased to 62, with 3,991 employees. By 1944, the number of factories in the entire border area had increased to 101, and the number of employees had increased to more than 12,000. Under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the entire Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region not only crushed countless attacks and blockades by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, but also transformed the poor and traffic-obstructed northern Shaanxi into a region with huge development in industrial economy. Comrade Chen Yougong, please think about how much more difficult our current situation is than that of the border area?
    "The budget is not approved enough, and the approval is slow." This is indeed the fact. This money belongs to the people. Shouldn't we be careful about the people's property? Taking our factory as an example, the controlled figures are more than 20 billion less than the budget. Are we not going to build the factory because of this? No, we must build it, and we must build it well. We can build it step by step according to priorities. As long as we can start construction, the output and quality will not be affected. For example, the workshops must be built well, and the auditorium can be built next year. Originally, we wanted two sets of cooling equipment, but we can get one set first, and temporarily change the rolling windows to rope-pulled windows, etc. I think it is also possible.
    "Lack of cadres" is also a fact. The Northwest Region feels even more difficulties in this regard. But can we just reach out to the higher authorities? Of course not, we mainly have to rely on ourselves to train. Here, leading cadres should be reminded to pay attention to whether we have fully exerted the power of the existing cadres and whether we have regularly educated them to study more in their work. The comrades who designed the factory in Beijing from February 1st to April 15th this year revised the machine layout diagram many times. The slogan they put forward at the time was "We have little experience, and we are willing to be primary school students." Even so, we inevitably have rework in small places (such as the position of machine anchor bolts). How about construction without correct design or without design at all?
    I remember when the factory was built in April this year, because there were no supervisors, the leading comrades felt that "such a large project cannot be without a construction engineer!" "If the superiors do not send us capable people, we will not be responsible if something goes wrong in the future!" At that time, two mud and wood workers with more than 20 years of experience, Li Yuanhao and Wang Changren, were dealt with, but the leadership seemed to despise them. Finally, they were reluctantly sent there. Facts have proved that they played a great role there. In addition to the opinions put forward verbally, there were 60 larger opinions put forward in writing, of which 42 were adopted and 18 were not adopted due to objective difficulties.
    In short, I think Comrade Chen Yougong's views are wrong. But why do these mistakes occur? "The important thing is to learn." Obviously, Comrade Chen Yougong's learning spirit is extremely insufficient. The People's Daily editorial pointed out that we should learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Comrade Chen Qing pointed out that we should learn the "Provisional Procedures for Basic Construction Work" issued by the Central Financial and Economic Commission and the State Council's decisions and instructions on this issue. This is absolutely necessary. I also hope that Comrade Chen Yougong will study the history of the Party well and see how the Chinese Communists overcame all difficulties in 30 years of arduous struggle and achieved today's brilliant victory!

### 必须老老实实学习——对陈有功同志的信的意见

　　必须老老实实学习
    ——对陈有功同志的信的意见
    近来我们全筹建处正在学习六月十六日人民日报“没有工程设计就不可能施工”的社论，及关于由于没有正确的工程设计就盲目施工，以致造成严重损失的各个通讯，这些材料对我们起了很大的教育作用。
    对陈有功同志的意见，绝大部分同志是反对的，但少数同志却好像赞同他的意见。这种思想若不即时纠正，就会使我们在基本建设工作中连吃败仗。换句话说，就会使人民的财产，继续遭受更惨重的损失。
    陈有功同志到底错在那里呢？
    我觉得陈有功同志有自满情绪，这种情绪会使我们在思想上，当了敌人的俘虏，使人民革命事业遭受很大的损失。批评与自我批评，是共产党区别于其他政党的重要标志之一。毛主席说，我们现在只不过像万里长征走完了第一步，陈有功同志似乎把这句话忘了。他开始对缺点容忍起来，他认为“我们够了”，难道我们对这种糊涂思想，不应当予以揭发吗？陈有功同志又认为“各企业间的领导干部，没有一个不是在主观上努力要把基本建设工作做好的”。但是更重要的，陈有功同志却没有注意到，那就是“对人民负责”，只看动机，不问效果，这是与马克思列宁主义的原则有所违背的。所谓负责，不能只凭一片好心肠，而必须按照实际情况办事，顾全大局，按规矩办事，准备不成熟的缓办，无把握的，宁可不办，要办就办好，办到底。中央关于基本建设投资的决定就是要求我们更负责。我们在这方面缺点是不少的，常常心中无数，计算不够，结果浪费国家人民财产！
    在我们基本建设工作中，困难是有的。正如人民日报的社论中所指出的：“当然，以我们国家现有的条件，进行周密的工程设计，不是没有困难的。我们应该承认：我们在基本建设方面还缺乏经验，设计工作人员还非常缺乏。”但问题是我们如何去克服这些困难。一个为马克思列宁主义武装起来的人，他会想尽各种办法，由黑暗走向光明，由失败走向胜利。
    一九三五年十月，毛主席率领红军主力到达陕北时，陕北仅有的工业是几十个人的修械所。到一九三七年，即有了被服、印刷、造纸、榨油等厂，全部职工已达六百余人。一九三八年秋冬之际，又相继创办了边区难民纺织厂及皮革、造纸、被服、农具及八路军制药厂等。一九三九年，又相继创办了新华化学厂、光华制药厂及其他纺织、榨油、陶瓷、采煤等工厂。一九四二年，工厂已增加到六十二个，职工已达三千九百九十一人。一九四四年全边区的工厂已增加到一百零一个，职工增到一万二千余。在党中央毛主席的直接领导之下，全陕甘宁边区的人民，不但粉碎了日本帝国主义及国民党反动派无数次的进攻及封锁，而且把贫瘠的、交通阻塞的陕北，变成在工业经济上有着巨大发展的地区。请陈有功同志想一想，我们现在的困难到底比边区能多多少呢？
    “预算批不够，批的慢”，这的确是事实。这些钱是人民的钱，难道对人民的财产不应当仔细吗？就以我们的工厂来说，控制数字比预算少二百多亿，难道我们就不办工厂了吗？不是的，我们一定要办，并且一定要办好，我们可以按轻重缓急逐步建设，只要能开工，产量质量上不受影响就行了，如场房一定要盖好，大礼堂等明年再盖，冷风装置本来要两套，但先弄一套，摇窗暂时改为绳拉的窗子等，我想也可以的。
    “干部缺”，这的确也是事实，西北区在这一方面更感到困难多端。但是光伸手向上级要能行吗？当然不行，主要还得靠自己去训练。在这里更要提醒领导干部注意的，就是在现有干部中，我们是否充分发挥了他们的力量？是否经常地教育他们要在工作中多方钻研？今年二月一日至四月十五日本厂在北京设计的同志，曾经把机器排列图修改过许多次。他们当时提出的口号是“我们经验少，甘当小学生”。就这样，我们在小的地方（如机器地脚螺丝位置），还难免有返工现象。何况是没有正确的设计或根本就没有设计而施工的呢？
    记得今年四月间建厂时，因为没有监工人员，领导同志觉得“这么大的工程，没有建筑工程师可不行啊！”“上级不给我们派得力人，将来出了事我们可负不了责任啊！”当时处理有两个二十多年经验的泥木工，李元浩和王长忍，但领导上却似乎轻视他们，最后没办法，才勉强把他们派去了。事实证明，他们在那里发挥很大的作用。除口头提出的意见不计外，以书面提出的较大的意见就有六十条，其中四十二条被采纳，十八条因客观困难未被采用。
    总之，陈有功同志的意见，我认为是错了。但为什么会产生这些错误呢？“重要的问题在于学习。”很显然，陈有功同志的学习精神是极其不够的。人民日报的社论中指出，我们应当学习苏联的先进经验，陈青同志指出应当学习中央财政经济委员会颁发的“基本建设工作程序暂行办法”及政务院对这一问题的决定和指示，这是完全必要的。我还希望陈有功同志很好地学习一下党史，看看中国共产党人怎样在三十年的艰苦斗争中，排除万难，取得了今天的辉煌胜利！
