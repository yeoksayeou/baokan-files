Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 3)
    Lü Shuxiang　Zhu Dexi
            Sixth Section  "Duiyu" and "Guanyu" ("Regarding" and "About")
    The usage of "Duiyu".  Part of the usage of "Duiyu" evolved from the literary Chinese character "Yu," so sometimes only the character "Yu" is used. Sometimes the meaning of the character "Dui" is particularly prominent, so only the character "Dui" is used. But the most common form is still "Duiyu."
    To analyze the usage of "Duiyu," we can first look at which word in the sentence the phrase "Duiyu..." is related to. Sometimes, this phrase is an adjunct to a noun, for example:
    (1) It is an organic acid, and its nutritional value to humans has not yet been determined. (Book)
    "Duiyu ren" ("to humans") is an adjunct to "nutritional value." Sometimes, it is an adjunct to an adjective, or it is related to an adjective that is not next to it. For example:
    (2) This is a situation that is beneficial to us and very unfavorable to imperialism.
    (3) For China, combat works are still more important now. (Lu) In (2), "Duiyu women" ("to us") is an adjunct to "beneficial," and "Duiyu diguo zhuyi" ("to imperialism") is an adjunct to "unfavorable." In (3), "Duiyu Zhongguo" ("to China") is related to "important."
    The most common is that the phrase "Duiyu..." is an adjunct to a verb. Here there is an important distinction. In some sentences, the verb does not govern the object of "Duiyu," for example:
    (4) We will never yield to any fierce enemy. (Mao)
    (5) There are also such people who have no enthusiasm for the cause of the people and take a cold, detached attitude towards the struggle and victory of the people and their vanguard. (Mao) In (4), "yield" is intransitive and does not govern "enemy." The verbs "have no" and "take" in (5) each have their own object; "have no" does not govern "cause," and "take" does not govern "struggle" and "victory." The following sentence is different:
    (6) It is not a shame, but an honor, to not understand one's own history at all, or to understand very little. (Mao) "History" is the object of "Duiyu," but it is also the object of "understand" in meaning. Understand what? Understand one's own history, right? Comparing it with (4), it is obviously different. "Not yield" is only "not yield to the enemy," not "not yield the enemy." This distinction is very important, as it divides sentences using "Duiyu" into two types. The first type is where the object is exclusively governed by "Duiyu," including various formats from (1) to (5). The second type is represented by (6), where the object of "Duiyu" is jointly governed by another verb. In addition, like
    (7) Both sides should forgive each other and each make correct self-criticism of themselves. (Mao) This type of sentence formally belongs to the first type, but in terms of meaning, it can be classified into the second type: "oneself" is still the object of "criticism," even though the latter has been transformed into a noun.
    Not "Duiyu". In the first type of sentence, what we should pay attention to is: is it most appropriate to use "Duiyu" here? The meaning expressed by "Duiyu" is indeed very broad, but it is not without limits. In sentences like the following, "Duiyu" should not be used; there are more appropriate verbs or conjunctions that can be used.
    (8) Every student's level of political understanding has improved a lot. (Written)
    (9) Let the American military commanders try to find an explanation for the "mysterious retreat riddle" of the Chinese and Korean People's Army. (Periodical)
    (10) Therefore, they regard some women's legitimate and reasonable divorce demands as "unruly," "jumping ship," "changing jobs," and "too naughty." (Newspaper)
    (11) When using pneumatic picks for the first time, the mechanical and electrical workers did not cooperate well with the pick operators, and the picks broke down and could not be repaired in time. (Newspaper)
    (12) The single-season late rice can save more than 6,000 kilograms of grain every year, which has played a great role in reducing costs and increasing the country's wealth. (Periodical) More appropriate would be: to in (8), for in (9), as in (10), with, and in (11), in...on in (12). The following four sentences with "Duiyu...shang" etc. are all unidiomatic mixed forms:
    (13) In the use of loans, it is necessary to invest them in the most important areas and the most needed agricultural tools in a timely and effective manner. (Newspaper)
    (14) The Northeast People's Government has made significant achievements in all aspects of draft animals, breeding, epidemic prevention, mechanized farming, water conservancy construction, and agricultural education. (Periodical)
    (15) The above points, from the perspective of translators, may be some technical issues. (Periodical)
    (16) The strategic position of Korea is very important for the US imperialist's attempt to invade China. (Periodical) The "Duiyu" in the first three sentences should be changed to "Zai" ("in"), and the last sentence should be changed to "Cong" ("from") or "Jiu" ("regarding"). From adding "shang," "fangmian," "kanlai," "laishuo," etc. after "Duiyu," we can say that the author has guessed right half the time. But why not use "Zai," "Cong," "Jiu" in front? It has to be said that they have been too fond of "Duiyu."
    Unnecessary "Duiyu".  Now we will talk about the second type of using "Duiyu." The function of "Duiyu" here is really to move the object forward, similar to the function of the word "Ba." For example:
    (17) We must study the history of our motherland well.
    (18) We must study the history of our motherland well. The structure of these two sentences is very similar, but the meaning of the two sentences is different. Using the word "Ba" indicates a behavior with a result (studying "well"); using "Duiyu" does not have this meaning. Using "Duiyu," the position of "the history of our motherland" is more important; using the word "Ba," it is not so obvious. In sentences using "Duiyu," the pronoun "ta" ("him/her/it") can be used after the verb to refer to the object, such as:
    (19) For those who are willing to cooperate with us, looking down on them or even excluding them. (Mao) This is not possible in sentences using the word "Ba."
    Since the structure of sentences using "Duiyu" is not as strict as sentences using the word "Ba," it is not as easy to judge when to use it and when not to use it as it is with sentences using "Ba." Generally speaking, using "Duiyu" to move the object forward is to highlight the object, either because it is important in itself, or because it needs to be distinguished from other things (such as when listing several items), and sometimes because it is too long. Measuring it against this standard, it is not necessary to use "Duiyu" in the following sentences:
    (20) Recently, due to our poor business, we are unable to afford the telephone bill and have decided to remove the telephone. (Newspaper)
    (21) The study and teaching of past history are much easier than the understanding of living society; the study of the history of new democracy is much easier than the creation of the history of new democracy. (Newspaper)
    (22) Because what US imperialism is carrying out is a war of aggression to slaughter, destroy, and enslave the people of Korea and China; what we are carrying out is a just war to defend peace, independence, and liberation. (Newspaper)
    (23) He can grasp the principles in handling problems. (Periodical)
    (24) This is because in work, he is distracted by one thing and loses sight of another, and cannot grasp the key of each work. (Periodical) Letting the object restore its inherent position (after the verb), such as changing (20) to "unable to afford the telephone bill," seems simpler and more natural. This distinction is most significant in example (21). "Studying and teaching past history is much easier than understanding living society; studying the history of new democracy is much easier than creating the history of new democracy," isn't it easier to read and easier to understand? (22) As long as you compare the two clauses before and after, you will know whether it is better to use "Duiyu" or not to use it. (23) "Handling" has been transformed into a noun, which is also unnecessary. "He handles problems and can grasp the principles," is better than the original in every way. (24) You can simply say "cannot grasp the main key of each work"; if you want to use "Duiyu," it should also be "cannot grasp the main key for each work." In the following two sentences, it is not necessary to use "Duiyu," nor is it necessary to move the object:
    (25) We must also constantly improve our own Chinese literacy. (Periodical)
    (26) We must be careful about recruiting new staff. (Letter) There are also some other sentences:
    (27) According to the general situation, after the liberation of the city, the workers will have grievances, and the personnel with bad work styles will definitely be criticized and educated by the masses. (Periodical)
    (28) Because reference books are used for checking at any time, if they are not convenient to check, then not only will the efficiency of librarians engaged in reference work be reduced, but also our young readers will waste time learning culture. (Manuscript) The "Duiyu" in them is added before the subject of the main verb, so these sentences are not even formally structured. This is not only an inappropriate use of words, but also a more serious mistake. If you want to use "Duiyu" in the first two sentences, (26) should say "...the masses will definitely criticize," and (27) should say "...will reduce their efficiency...will waste their time."
    Who "Duiyu" whom.  This is another question about the usage of "Duiyu." In many sentences, the subject and object of "Duiyu" are reversed. For example:
    (29) The history from 1944 to 1948 is quite familiar to us. (Written)
    (30) Here, he learned chemistry, biology, especially animal husbandry, which he was particularly interested in. (Newspaper)
    (31) Today, for middle-aged and older British people, the days when they could eat half a dozen eggs and bite into large steaks every day are just sweet memories. (Periodical)
    (32) ...Although this also involved some sacrifices for the Soviet Union and gave some benefits to foreign capital. (Newspaper) Literally, it is not that people are familiar with history but that history is familiar with people, not that people are interested in animal husbandry but that animal husbandry is interested in people, and what has become a sweet memory is not the past days but middle-aged and older British people, and it is not the Soviet Union that has made sacrifices but others. This is certainly not the original intention of these authors. Then, it should be said like this: (29) We are quite familiar with the history of...; (30) especially animal husbandry, which he is most interested in; (31) For...British people, the past...days are just sweet memories; (32) Although the Soviet Union has also made some sacrifices in this regard.
    The position of "Duiyu...".  The phrase "Duiyu..." can be placed before the subject or after the subject. This difference is sometimes very important. Here are three sentences:
    (33) Mathematics seems to be particularly difficult for me to understand. (Written)
    (34) We are very admiring of Comrade Chen's willingness to frankly reveal this kind of mistake, so that our subordinate bureau can raise its vigilance, this precious spirit. (Letter)
    (35) When we commemorate Lenin, let us review Comrade Lenin's instructions on the trade union issue. This is to improve the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism of Chinese trade union workers on trade union issues, so as to strengthen our consciousness in trade union work, overcome its blindness, and improve the theoretical level of our trade union work by one step, so as to avoid us taking more detours. This is what we should do when commemorating Lenin. (Newspaper) (33) Obviously commits the mistake of reversing the subject and object in the previous section, but if you move "Duiyu wo" ("to me") to the front of "Mathematics," this sentence will make sense. (34) The object of "Duiyu" has a very long adjunct, which separates "we" and "very admirable" so far that it is very difficult to read and the meaning is easy to confuse. If you move "we" after "spirit," the problem will be solved. (35) After a "Duiyu," the main verb is not seen, which becomes an incomplete sentence. This is also because the object of "Duiyu" is lengthened, and the author also forgot that there was a "Duiyu" in front. If the author did not say the word "this" at the beginning, he would definitely remember to end this phrase in the appropriate place, then "this," and then give it a predicate, such as "will be of great help." (There are many problems with this sentence, which will not be discussed in detail.)
    According to our observation, there are really too many "Duiyu" in today's general articles, at least half of them are used inappropriately or unnecessarily. It is like licorice in Chinese medicine and penicillin in Western medicine, which can be used everywhere. When a sentence has not yet decided how to say it, first give it a "Duiyu," anyway, it can't be wrong - isn't this very convenient? I didn't expect that there is no panacea in language. If a word can really be applied everywhere, it will become meaningless. I hope "Duiyu" does not go down this road.
    "Guanyu" and "Duiyu".  "Guanyu" and "Duiyu" should be different, and in fact, there are indeed some sentences that will not be confused. For example:
    (36) We have heard a lot about how the American imperialists usually oppress the black people in their country. (Periodical)
    (37) Regarding the disappearance of Professor Fei Gong, there were various legends at the beginning. (Periodical)
    (38) Regarding this issue, you can refer to... (Book) No one would use "Duiyu" instead of "Guanyu" in these three sentences. But like the following two sentences that appear in the same article:
    (39) In fact, this book does not have a sufficiently complete description of these two important issues. (Newspaper)
    (40) In the first chapter, the content of the new culture and the differentiation of the cultural united front are described too briefly. (Newspaper)
    The author uses "Dui" in one sentence and "Guanyu" in another sentence. It seems that it can also be reversed. I can't see any difference. For example, this sentence:
    (41) The scope of revolutionary cultural relics has been clearly stipulated in the order issued by the State Council to solicit revolutionary cultural relics. (Periodical) Should "Duiyu" or "Guanyu" be used? Or none of them? In short, according to the current usage, "Guanyu" and "Duiyu" cannot be completely distinguished in some sentences.
    Unnecessary "Guanyu", not "Guanyu".  Like "Duiyu", the "Guanyu" in some sentences is unnecessary or even impossible. For example:
    (42) Regarding the above two courses, the content is quite rich, and they are all helpful to practice. (Written)
    (43) Regarding this point, after the land reform, everyone has a legitimate production career, which may gradually decrease, and even disappear. (Periodical)
    (44) In the Beijing Research Office, the losses in terms of instruments are the most. (Periodical) (42) and (43) both put a "Guanyu" in front of the subject, so these two sentences have no subject. Removing "Guanyu" makes the sentence structure complete and the meaning is not lost at all. ("This point" in example (43) should be changed to "this situation.") (44) Using "Guanyu" in connection with "fangmian" is not as common as the word "Zai" ("in"); and in this sentence, it is not needed at all.
    There are also some sentences in which "Guanyu", like some other "Duiyu", should be replaced by more appropriate words, such as:
    (45) Regarding the books that discuss the eve of World War II, I think the following three books are worth reading. (Newspaper) This sentence should not use "Guanyu," but should use "in...".

                                        (End of this section, the entire article is not finished)

　　语法、修辞讲话（第三讲）
    吕叔湘　朱德熙
            第六段  对于、关于
    “对于”的用法。  “对于”的用法，一部分是从文言的“于”字脱化出来的，所以有时候就只用一个“于”字。有时候“对”字的意思特别显著，又就只用一个“对”字。但是最普通的形式还是“对于”。
    分析“对于”的用法，可以先看“对于……”这个短语跟句子里哪一个词关联。有时候，这个短语是名词的附加语，例如：
    （一）它是一种有机酸，对于人的营养价值还没有能确定。（书）
    “对于人”是“营养价值”的附加语。有时候，它是一个形容词的附加语，或是跟一个跟它不在一块的形容词关联。例如：
    （二）这是对于我们有利而对于帝国主义非常不利的形势。
    （三）对于中国，现在也还是战斗的作品更为紧要。（鲁）（二）的“对于我们”是“有利”的附加语，“对于帝国主义”是“不利”的附加语。（三）的“对于中国”跟“紧要”关联。
    最常见的是“对于……”这个短语做动词的附加语。这里有一个重要的区别。有些句子里，那个动词管不着“对于”的宾语，例如：
    （四）对于无论什么凶恶的敌人我们决不屈服。（毛）
    （五）也有这样的一种人，他们对于人民的事业，并无热情，对于人民及其先锋队的战斗和胜利，抱着冷眼旁观的态度。（毛）（四）“屈服”是不及物的，管不着“敌人”。（五）的动词“无”和“抱”各有自己的宾语，“无”管不着“事业”，“抱”管不着“战斗”和“胜利”。底下这一句就不同了：
    （六）对于自己的历史一点不懂，或懂得很少，不以为耻，反以为荣。（毛）“历史”是“对于”的宾语，可是在意义上也是“懂”的宾语。懂什么？懂自己的历史，不是吗？拿（四）来比较，就显然不同。“不屈服”只是“对敌人”不屈服，不是“不屈服敌人”。这个区别是很重要的，它把用“对于”的句子分成两个类型。第一个类型是宾语专门让“对于”管着的，包括从（一）到（五）各种格式。第二个类型是（六）所代表的、“对于”的宾语有别的动词共管的。另外，像
    （七）应该双方互相原谅，而各对自己作正确的自我批评。（毛）这一类句子，形式上属于第一类型，但以意义而论可以归入第二类型：“自己”仍然是“批评”的对象，虽然后者已经转成名词。
    不是“对于”。在第一类句子里头，要留心的是：在这里，是否用“对于”最恰当。“对于”所表示的意思的确很广泛，可是也不是漫无限制。像底下这些句子里就不该用“对于”，另有更恰当的动词或连接词可用。
    （八）每个同学对于政治认识的水平都提高了不少。（作）
    （九）让美国军事指挥官们试图对中朝人民军的“神秘撤退的哑谜”找寻解释吧。（期）
    （十）因此他们对某些妇女的正当合理的离婚要求看成是“不规矩”，是“跳圈”“跳槽”，是“太调皮了”。（报）
    （十一）在最初使用风镐时，机电工人对风镐手配合得不好，风镐坏了不能及时修理。（报）
    （十二）单方洋一场每年就要节省粮食六千多斤，对于减低成本增加国家的财富起了很大的作用。（期）更恰当的是：（八）的，（九）给，（十）把，（十一）和，跟，（十二）在……上。下面这四句的“对于……上”等等都是不合习惯的混合形式：
    （十三）对贷款的运用上，要及时有效地投到最重要的地区、最需要的农具上去。（报）
    （十四）东北人民政府对于耕畜、繁殖、防疫、机耕、水利建设、农业教育各方面都有显著的成绩。（期）
    （十五）上面几点，对于翻译工作者看来，也许是些技术问题。（期）
    （十六）朝鲜的战略地位，对于美帝侵略中国的企图来说，是十分重要的。（期）前三句的“对于”都应该改做“在”，后一句的应该改做“从”或“就”。从“对于”后面加用“上”“方面”“看来”“来说”等等看来，我们可以说作者已经猜对了一半。可是前面为什么不用“在”“从”“就”呢？不能不说是对于“对于”未免偏爱了。
    不必“对于”。  现在要谈一谈用“对于”的第二个类型。这里面的“对于”的作用实在是把宾语提前，跟“把”字的作用是类似的。例如：
    （十七）我们对于祖国的历史要好好学习。
    （十八）我们要把祖国的历史学习好。这两句的构造十分相似，可是两句的意思不同。用“把”字，表示一种有结果的行为（学习“好”）；用“对于”，没有这个意思。用“对于”，“祖国的历史”的地位更加重要；用“把”字，没有这样明显。用“对于”的句子，动词后面可以用“他”来复指宾语，如：
    （十九）对于愿意和我们合作的人，看不起他，甚至排斥他。（毛）用“把”字的句子就不能了。
    用“对于”的句子的结构既然没有用“把”字的句子那么严，什么时候该用，什么时候不必用，就不像用“把”的句子那么容易判断。大概说，用“对于”把宾语提前，为的是要让宾语突出，或是因为它本身重要，或是因为要跟别的事物区别（如列举几项的时候），还有时候是因为它太长。拿这个标准来衡量，下面这些句子里都不必用“对于”：
    （二十）近因我们营业不振，对电话费无力负担，决定将电话机拆除。（报）
    （二一）对于过去历史的研究与教学，比对于活的社会的认识，要容易的多；对于新民主主义的历史研究，比对于新民主主义的历史创造，要容易的多。（报）
    （二二）因为美帝国主义所进行的是对朝中两国人民屠杀、摧毁与奴役的侵略战争；我们所进行的是保卫和平、独立与解放的正义战争。（报）
    （二三）他对问题的处理能掌握原则。（期）
    （二四）这是工作当中顾此失彼，对每一个工作的主要关键不能抓住的缘故。（期）让宾语恢复它固有的位置（动词之后），如（二十）改做“无力负担电话费”，就显得简洁些，也自然些。这个分别，（二一）例最为显著。“研究与教学过去的历史，比认识活的社会，要容易得多；研究新民主主义的历史，比创造新民主主义的历史，要容易得多，”这不是念起来顺口得多，听起来容易懂得多吗？（二二）只要比较一下前后两个分句，就会知道还是用“对于”好些，还是不用好些。（二三）“处理”已经转成名词，这也是不必要的，“他处理问题能掌握原则，”从哪方面看来都比原来好。（二四）尽可以说“不能抓住每一个工作的主要关键”；如果要用“对于”，也应该是“对于每一个工作不能抓住主要关键”。下面这两句，不必用“对于”，也不必挪动宾语：
    （二五）我们对自己的中文修养也要不断提高。（期）
    （二六）我们对于录用新人员必须要慎重。（信）另外有一些句子：
    （二七）据一般情形，城市解放之后，工人就有诉苦运动，对于有坏作风的人员，一定受到群众的批评教育。（期）
    （二八）因为工具书要随时用来检查的，如其在检查上不方便，那末不但对于从事参考工作的图书馆人员要减低效率，对于我们青年读者学习文化，尤将浪费时间。（稿）那里面的“对于”是加在主要动词的主语前头的，因此这些句子连形式上也不成格局。这就不仅是用字失当，而是一种更严重的错误了。前两句如果要用“对于”，（二六）应该说“……群众一定会批评”，（二七）应该说“……要减低他们的效率……要浪费他们的时间”。
    谁“对于”谁。  这是关于“对于”的用法的另一个问题。许多句子里把“对于”的主体和客体弄颠倒了。例如：
    （二九）一九四四年到一九四八年的历史，对于我们都是相当熟悉的。（作）
    （三十）在这里，他学到了化学、生物、特别是对他有特别兴趣的畜牧学。（报）
    （三一）今天中年以上的英国人，对于过去的每天可以吃半打鸡蛋、大块地啃着牛排的日子，只是甜蜜的记忆了。（期）
    （三二）……虽然这对苏联也是有过一些牺牲，给了外国资本一些好处。（报）照字面看，不是人熟悉历史而是历史熟悉人，不是人对畜牧学有兴趣而是畜牧学对人有兴趣，成为甜蜜的记忆的不是过去的日子而是中年以上的英国人，有过牺牲的不是苏联而是别人。这当然不是这几位作者的本意。那末，应该这样说：（二九）我们对于……的历史都是相当熟悉的；（三十）特别是他最感兴趣的畜牧学；（三一）对于……英国人，过去……的日子只是甜蜜的记忆了；（三二）虽然苏联在这上头也有过一些牺牲。
    “对于……”的位置。  “对于……”这个短语可以放在主语之前，也可以放在主语之后。这个差别有时候很有关系。这里有三个句子：
    （三三）数学对于我好像是分外难于了解。（作）
    （三四）我们对于陈同志肯率直的揭发这种错误、使我们的属局可以提高警惕、这种宝贵的精神是非常感佩的。（信）
    （三五）当我们纪念列宁的时候，让我们来温习一下列宁同志关于职工会问题的训示。这对于提高中国工会工作者的对于工会问题的马列主义的理论水平，借以加强我们在工会工作中的自觉性，克服其盲目性，把我们工会工作的理论水平提高一步，以免我们走更多的弯路。这就是我们纪念列宁时候应该作的事。（报）（三三）显然犯了上一节主客颠倒的毛病，可是如果把“对于我”挪在“数学”前头去，这一句就讲得通了。（三四）“对于”的宾语有很长的附加语，把“我们”和“非常感佩”隔得老远的，念起来很吃力，意思也容易糊涂。如果把“我们”挪到“精神”后头，问题就解决了。（三五）一个“对于”之后，不见主要动词，成了个不完全的句子。这也是因为“对于”的宾语一拉长，作者也忘了前面有个“对于”了。如果作者不把“这”字说在头里，他一定会记得在适当地方结束这个短语，然后“这”，然后给它一个谓语，例如“是会有很大的帮助的”。（这一句的毛病很多，不去详细讨论。）
    照我们的观察，现在的一般文章里的“对于”实在太多了，至少有一半是用得不恰当，或是不必要。仿佛是中药里的甘草，西药里的盘尼西林，哪儿都用得上似的。一句话该怎么说，还没有拿定主意的时候，先给它来个“对于”，反正错不了——这不很方便吗？没想到语言里头没有万应灵丹，如果一个词真能到处应用，一定会变成毫无意义。希望“对于”不至于走上这条路。
    “关于”和“对于”。  “关于”和“对于”应该有分别，事实上也的确有好些句子是不会混用的。例如：
    （三六）关于美帝国主义者平常怎样压迫它国内的黑人，我们已经听到很多了。（期）
    （三七）关于费巩教授的失踪，当初有种种传说。（期）
    （三八）关于这个问题，可以参考……（书）这三句是决不会有人不用“关于”而用“对于”的。但是像底下出现在同一篇文章里的两句：
    （三九）实际上，对这两个重要问题，本书并没有足够完备的叙述。（报）
    （四十）而在第一章内，关于新文化的内容及文化统一战线的分化，则叙述得过于简略。（报）
    作者在一句里用“对”，在另一句里用“关于”。好像倒个过儿也可以。看不出有什么分别。又如这一句：
    （四一）对于革命文物的范围，在政务院所颁布征集革命文物命令中已经规定得很清楚。（期）究竟该用“对于”呢，还是该用“关于”？还是一个都不同？总之，以现在的用例而论，“关于”和“对于”在某些句子里还不能完全分清。
    不必“关于”、不是“关于”。  跟“对于”一样，有些句子里的“关于”是不必要的，甚至是不能有的。例如：
    （四二）关于以上两门课程，内容都是相当丰富的，而且都是于实际有帮助的。（作）
    （四三）关于这一点，在土改之后，每一个人有了正当的生产事业，可能逐渐减少，以至于绝迹。（期）
    （四四）北京研究室里，关于仪器方面的损失最多。（期）（四二）和（四三）都在主语前面安上个“关于”，于是这两句就没有主语了。把“关于”去掉，句子结构完整了，意义也毫无损失。（四三例的“这一点”应该改做“这种情形”。）（四四）用“关于”和“方面”联系，不及“在”字普通；而在这一句里，根本就不需要。
    又有些句子里的“关于”，也跟另一些“对于”一样，是应该用更恰当的词语来替代的，如：
    （四五）关于论及第二次世界大战前夕的书籍，我认为以下三书值得一读。（报）这句不该用“关于”，该用“在……中”。
                                        （本段完，全文未完）
