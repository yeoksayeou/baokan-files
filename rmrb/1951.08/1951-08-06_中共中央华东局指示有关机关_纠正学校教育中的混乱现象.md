The chaotic phenomena in school education discovered in the Southwest region also exist in large quantities in the East China region, and in some areas the severity even exceeds that of the Southwest region. Judging from the existing materials from Fujian, Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and northern Anhui, students are often arbitrarily pulled to participate in crash work, or mobilized to participate in welcoming parties, send-off parties, and venue arrangements, or asked to beat waist drums to send off collectively tax-paying merchants and collectively grain-delivering farmers. Some county and district party and government organs emphasize: "Central work overrides everything." They believe that education cadres are mobile cadres, and arbitrarily draw educational staff, even to the point of causing schools to collapse. In terms of school leadership, there is a serious phenomenon of multiple leadership; administrative departments, trade unions, student federations, Party committees, Communist Youth League committees, women's federations, as well as the Resist America, Aid Korea Association and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, often each arrange their own agenda, resulting in students and teachers having many positions, many meetings, and many social activities. As a result, the better the student, the worse their grades become; the more progressive the teacher, the more positions and meetings they have, and the worse they teach. Moreover, this seriously affects the physical health of students and teachers. The situation of arbitrarily recruiting or mobilizing students in school is also very common. Although strictly prohibited by Party organizations and administrative leading organs, individual units still secretly mobilize students at schools. Some even knowingly recruit students who are already in school, but deliberately pretend not to know, or even send people to persuade the school to approve students' withdrawal from school, which is an extremely bad practice. In addition, the arbitrary occupation of school buildings is also very serious in some areas, which affects the recovery and development of education. All the above-mentioned situations have seriously damaged the planned and organized nature of the people's education cause and greatly affected the normal development of school education. This shows that some cadres hold a narrow-minded ideology of only caring about themselves and disregarding the overall situation, and a seriously irresponsible attitude towards the people's education cause. The CCP Central Committee East China Bureau has instructed relevant leading organs to conduct in-depth inspections and strict corrections of this erroneous phenomenon.

　　中共中央华东局指示有关机关
    纠正学校教育中的混乱现象
    西南地区所发现的学校教育中的混乱现象，在华东地区也大量存在，有的地区其严重情况甚至超过西南地区。仅据已有的福建、浙江、皖南、皖北等地的材料看来，也时常发生随便拉学生参加突击工作，或动员学生参加欢迎会、欢送会、布置会场，或叫学生打着腰鼓欢送集体缴税的商人和集体纳粮的农民。部分县区党政机关强调：“中心工作压倒一切”。认为教育干部是机动干部，而随便乱抽教育工作人员，甚至使学校垮了台。学校领导上则存在严重的多头现象，行政、工会、学联、党团、妇联以及抗美援朝会、中苏友好协会等，往往各自布置一套，形成学校师生职务多、会议多、社会活动多，结果弄得愈是好学生功课愈坏；愈是进步教员职务、会议愈多，功课也就越来越教不好。而且严重影响了学生和教员的身体健康。任意招考或动员在校学生的情况也很多，虽经党的组织及行政领导机关严格禁止，但仍有个别单位私下到学校动员学生。更有明知招来的是在校学生，却故意装作不知道，或竟派人劝说学校批准学生退学等极端恶劣的作风。此外，随便占用学校房舍，在有的地区也很严重，致影响教育的恢复与发展。以上种种情形都严重破坏了人民教育事业的计划性与组织性，大大影响了学校教育的正常发展。这说明了部分干部对于学校教育工作，抱着只顾自己，不顾全局的狭隘思想和对人民教育事业严重的不负责任态度。中共中央华东局已指示有关领导机关，对于这种错误现象进行深入的检查和严格的纠正。
