    Anti-Corruption Study Conducted by All Employees of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation, Shijiazhuang Branch
    After reading the report in the newspaper about the corruption and dereliction of duty by cadres of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation, Tangshan Branch, which caused huge losses to state property, all the employees of our China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation, Shijiazhuang Branch, divided into groups to discuss it. All the employees made ideological self-examinations and exposed some erroneous thoughts in the discussion. For example, some business cadres believed that accepting invitations and gifts from private merchants in the past was nothing; and some cadres, when going out for inspection work, over-reported one day's "subsidy" for field work when submitting their accounts, thinking it did not matter. After this study, everyone agreed that the above behaviors were completely wrong, and over-reporting field work subsidies was an act of corruption. Everyone agreed that we must strengthen our study, raise our political awareness, and prevent such corrupt thoughts from eroding us.
    Through the study, everyone clearly recognized the reasons for the corruption incident at the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation, Tangshan Branch, which was that those cadres had politically degenerated and lost the position of revolutionary workers. The main ideological source of this error was individualism; in order to seek personal gain, they forgot about revolutionary interests and committed all kinds of illegal and undisciplined acts. In addition, the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism in the company was very lacking. Many comrades could not uphold the truth and correct mistakes; they did not conduct serious struggles against illegal and derelict personnel, but instead adopted a tolerant and concealing attitude. This incident has caused undue losses to national materials and the government's prestige. We fully support the handling of this matter by the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Supervision Committee of the Hebei Provincial People's Government.
    In order to do our work well and oppose corruption, we guarantee to do the following in the future:
    1. Strengthen political and professional study. Oppose the tendency to only value business and not pay attention to politics. Grain storage guarantees timely inspection, not a single grain goes bad, and accounts are always consistent with goods.
    2. Master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and establish the idea of running the enterprise well.
    3. Stand firm and resist private merchants' invitations and other temptations. Conduct strict inspections during grain processing. Resolutely fight against corruption.

### 中国粮食公司石家庄分公司  全体职工进行反贪污学习

　　中国粮食公司石家庄分公司  全体职工进行反贪污学习
    我们中国粮食公司石家庄分公司全体职工看了报上所载中国粮食公司唐山分公司干部贪污失职、使国家财产受到巨大损失的稿件后，就分成小组对此进行讨论。职工们都从思想上作了检查，在讨论中暴露了一些错误思想。如个别业务工作干部认为过去接受私商的邀宴、礼物算不了什么；还有一些干部出去检查工作，回来报账时多报一天外出工作“补助费”，竟认为没有关系。经过这次学习，大家一致认为上述行为是完全错误的，多报外出工作补助费，就是贪污行为。大家一致认为必须加强学习，提高政治觉悟，防止此类腐化思想来侵蚀自己。
    经过学习，大家明确地认识了中国粮食公司唐山分公司贪污事件的原因，是那些干部在政治上已经蜕化，丧失了革命工作者的立场。这种错误的主要思想根源就是个人主义；他们为了贪图个人利益就忘掉了革命利益，而做出种种违法乱纪的事情来。此外，该公司批评与自我批评的空气是十分缺乏的。很多同志不能坚持真理，修正错误；对违法失职人员不进行严肃的斗争，反而采取容忍、掩饰的态度。这个事件，已经使国家资材和政府威信受到不应有的损失。我们完全拥护中共河北省委员会纪律检查委员会和河北省人民政府人民监察委员会的处理。
    为了做好我们的工作，反对贪污，我们保证今后做到以下几点：
    一，加强政治、业务学习。反对只重业务、不问政治的倾向。粮食保管保证及时检查，不坏一粒粮，账货经常相符。
    二，掌握批评与自我批评的武器，树立搞好企业的思想。
    三，站稳立场，不受私商请客及其他引诱。在粮食加工中严格进行检查。坚决和贪污行为做斗争。
