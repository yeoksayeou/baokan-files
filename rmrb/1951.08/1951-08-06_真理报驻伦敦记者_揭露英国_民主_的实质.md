Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 2nd, TASS dispatch:

　　The *Pravda* published a dispatch from its London correspondent, Mayevsky, entitled "Facts Expose the Truth." He cited several examples to illustrate what the notorious Labour Party's "freedom" actually amounts to. Mayevsky wrote that as a result of the arms expansion movement, the more British workers have to tighten their belts, the more reactionary the order created by the Labour government domestically becomes—the more British newspapers and radio stations are forced to praise "British democracy" and slander the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Recently, the British Central Office of Information published a commentary on the new Soviet magazine "News." The author of this commentary, using shameless fabrications as the main argument, said that the Soviet Union has, no more and no less, territorial ambitions and claims to…the Indian Ocean!

　　Mayevsky emphasized that it is not difficult to understand that the masters of British newspapers need all these lies in order to divert their readers' attention from the situation in Britain and to shift the responsibility for the arms expansion movement and the preparation for war onto the Soviet Union.

　　Those who determine British policy are afraid of the true situation in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. This truth is being carefully concealed from the British people. Therefore, British newspapers do not mention at all that the Soviet people have brilliantly completed the First Stalin Post-War Five-Year Plan, and they also "failed to notice" the repeated price reductions of food and industrial products in the Soviet Union.

　　True reports about life in the Soviet Union published in British democratic publications by people who have visited the Soviet Union are always attacked by reactionary newspapers.

　　The persecution of peace fighters by the British Labour authorities also convincingly illustrates the nature of the so-called British "freedom" and bourgeois "democracy."

　　Mayevsky continued that the British bourgeois newspapers say that British citizens are free to travel abroad and report back. Recently, the British authorities have provided another example of this Labour Party "democracy." They rudely seized the passport issued by the Foreign Office to the famous scientist Dr. Bo Ho-pu, who was to accompany the delegation of the British-Soviet Friendship Association to the Soviet Union, and prohibited him from going abroad.

　　Mayevsky pointed out that there is no doubt that more Soviet people will come to visit Britain in the future, because they are not coming for the special "hospitality" of the Labour authorities.

　　Mayevsky mentioned that near the end of 1950, several members of the Soviet delegation who attended the Sheffield World Peace Congress were refused British visas, the director Gerasimov was refused entry, and so on.

　　Mayevsky concluded by writing: British newspapers willingly devote much space to warmongers, and slavishly publish calls for the persecution of people with progressive ideas. A few days ago, a Captain Hopper in North Birmingham openly asked why... an atomic bomb was not dropped on Moscow tomorrow. At the same time, Smithers, a Conservative Member of Parliament, even demanded that the Most Reverend Hewlett Johnson, Dean of Canterbury, be tried and publicly hanged - an International Stalin Peace Prize laureate, so respected by all progressive mankind.

### 真理报驻伦敦记者  揭露英国“民主”的实质

　　真理报驻伦敦记者
    揭露英国“民主”的实质
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二日电：真理报刊载该报驻伦敦记者马耶夫斯基的通讯，题为“事实揭穿真相”。他举出若干例子说明声名狼籍的工党的“自由”实际上是些什么东西。马耶夫斯基写道，由于扩张军备运动的结果，英国劳动者越要束紧他们的腰带，工党政府在国内造成的秩序就越反动——英国报纸和电台就越强要赞扬“英国的民主”和诽谤苏联与人民民主国家。最近英国中央宣传处对苏联出版的新杂志“新闻”发表了评论。这篇评论的作者，用无耻的捏造作为主要的论据，说苏联不多不少对……印度洋有领土野心和领土要求！
    马耶夫斯基强调说，不难了解，英国报纸的主子需要这一切谎言，以便转移他们的读者对英国国内情况的注意，想把进行扩张军备运动和准备战争的责任转嫁到苏联身上。
    决定英国政策的人害怕苏联及各人民民主国家的真实情况。这种真实情况正被他们仔细地掩盖起来不让英国人民知道。因此，英国报纸完全不谈苏联人民已光辉地完成了第一个斯大林战后五年计划，它也“未注意到”苏联的粮食和工业品屡次减价等事实。
    访问过苏联的人士在英国民主刊物上发表的关于苏联生活的真实报道，总是要遭受反动报纸的攻击。
    和平战士遭受英国工党当局的迫害一事也令人信服地说明了所谓英国的“自由”和资产阶级“民主”的性质。
    马耶夫斯基继续说，英国资产阶级报纸说，英国公民能够自由地赴国外旅行并回国报告。最近英国当局又提供了一个这种工党“民主”的例子。他们粗暴地夺去了外交部发给要随英苏友好协会代表团赴苏联的著名科学家柏贺浦博士的护照，并且禁止他出国。
    马耶夫斯基指出，没有疑问，将来会有更多的苏联人民来访问英国，因为他们并不是为工党当局的特殊“款待”而来的。
    马耶夫斯基提起，一九五○年快到年底的时候，出席设菲尔德世界和平大会的苏联代表团一行多人被拒绝发给英国签证，导演格拉西莫夫被拒绝入境，等等。
    马耶夫斯基在结语中写道：英国报纸甘心情愿地把许多篇幅给予战争贩子们，奴颜婢膝地刊载要求迫害具有进步思想的人民的叫嚣。几天以前，北明翰有一个名叫霍柏的上尉公开问道，为什么………明天不在莫斯科投原子弹。同时议会保守党议员斯米塞斯竟要求审判并当众绞死一切进步人类所如此尊敬的国际斯大林和平奖金获得者、坎特伯雷副主教约翰逊。
