Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: Paris Dispatch: Fifty-five days after the French general election and thirty-two days after the resignation of the Queuille government, the French ruling clique, after experiencing an unprecedentedly long government crisis in French history, barely managed to produce René Pleven, the leader of the "Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance" and the Deputy Prime Minister of the previous government, who formed a government on August 11.

　　Pleven was praised by the "New York Herald Tribune" as "one of the most enthusiastic fighters for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Schuman Plan, and for the establishment of a European army." He was entrusted by French President Auriol on the 3rd to carry out the task of forming a cabinet. In the process of forming the cabinet, Pleven traveled around extensively, trying to win over the heads of various reactionary parties to support him, but made little progress. Later, it was only because the United States issued a warning to the French reactionary parties about the protracted French government crisis that Pleven was fortunate enough to obtain the support of 391 votes in the National Assembly and gained "trust"; then, after three days of fierce wrangling, he put together the core members of his cabinet.

　　However, although Pleven has formed a new cabinet, the internal contradictions of the French ruling clique, which have deepened due to the failure of the general election, have become more public. Although the Socialist Party and the Popular Republican Movement voted in the National Assembly in favor of Pleven's cabinet formation, they both stated that this approval was conditional. And the Socialist Party has decided not to participate in the Pleven government. This makes the foundation of the Pleven government even weaker than that of the Queuille government before the general election. The reason why the Socialist Party is playing this deceptive trick is precisely because, in the face of the angry French people, the Socialist Party no longer dares to openly share the responsibility with the Pleven government for implementing anti-people policies.

　　In view of this situation, even the United States has to admit that the Pleven government's future is bleak. An Associated Press dispatch from Paris on the 8th admitted that the Socialist Party's failure to participate in the government will make "Pleven's task difficult. Such an arrangement often creates an unstable government." An AP dispatch from Paris on the 11th also said that "this decision" of the Socialist Party not to participate in the government "is expected to shorten the life of the new cabinet."

　　法政府危机延续三十余天后
    普利文勉强拼凑成新政府
    法统治集团内部矛盾更趋公开
    【新华社十三日讯】巴黎消息：在法国大选举行五十五天，葛义政府辞职三十二天之后，法国统治集团经历了法国历史上空前长时间的政府危机，才勉强推出“民主社会抵抗联盟”的魁首，上届政府副总理普利文，在八月十一日组成了政府。
    普利文被《纽约先驱论坛报》捧为“拥护北大西洋公约与舒曼计划，拥护成立欧洲军的最起劲的战士之一”。他是在三日奉法国总统阿里奥尔之命进行组阁活动的。普利文在组阁活动过程中，多方奔走，拉拢各反动党派头子为他撑腰，但进展甚微。后来只是因为美国就法国政府危机之旷日持久对法国各反动党派发出了警告，普利文才侥幸在国民议会里获得三百九十一票的支持，取得了“信任”；然后又经过三天的激烈争吵，才拼凑起自己内阁的班底。
    但是，普利文虽然组成了新阁，法国统治集团由于大选失败而加深的内部矛盾已更趋公开。社会党和人民共和党虽然在国民议会投票赞成普利文组阁，但都表示这一赞成是有条件的。并且社会党已决定不参加普利文政府。这样就使得普利文政府的基础，甚至比大选以前的葛义政府还要脆弱。而社会党之所以玩弄这一手骗人的把戏，又正好说明了在愤怒的法国人民面前，社会党已不敢公开与普利文政府共同分担推行反人民政策的责任。
    鉴于这种情况，甚至连美国方面也不得不承认普利文政府前途暗淡。美联社巴黎八日电承认：社会党不参加政府将使“普利文的任务变得困难。这样一种安排常常会造成一个不安定的政府”。该社巴黎十一日电又说，社会党不参加政府的“这个决定预料将缩短新内阁的寿命”。
