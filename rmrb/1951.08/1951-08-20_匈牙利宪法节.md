　　Hungarian Constitution Day
    Dr. Éric Molnár, Minister of Justice of the Hungarian People's Republic, Member of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party
    The Hungarian working people are celebrating the second anniversary of their Constitution Day amidst the escalating imperialist aggression and the growing strength of the peace camp led by the Soviet Union. On August 20, 1949, the Hungarian people's first written constitution was adopted by the parliament. This is the fundamental law of the Hungarian People's Republic, which consolidates the achievements made by our people since the liberation of our country by the Soviet Union up to that time, and at the same time points out the prospects for further development. The Constitution of the Hungarian people embodies the will to defend peace. This fundamental law consolidates the power of the working people and points out the way to solve various problems of the Hungarian nation.
    What had not been achieved in the past thousands of years was achieved by the Hungarian People's Democratic government within five years of liberation, following the Soviet experience and under the leadership of the communist party – the Hungarian Working People's Party. The introduction of the Constitution points out that due to the Soviet Union's world-historic victory, the Hungarian people were liberated from the shackles of German fascists and the anti-people state power of domestic landlords and capitalists. The Soviet Union made it possible for our country to move towards socialism along the path of people's democracy, and since then, the Soviet Union has helped the Hungarian working people in all aspects with its fraternal assistance and rich experience in socialist construction.
    The Constitution states that Hungary is a People's Republic, a state of workers and working peasants under the leadership of the working class. In this country, the basis of the social system is labor, and all power belongs to the working people. The Hungarian People's Republic fights against all systems of exploitation of man by man. The basic parts of the means of production are in the hands of the working people's state or in cooperatives, and the working people are thoroughly building a socialist economic system.
    The Constitution states that underground resources, mines and large industrial enterprises, means of transport and transportation, state-owned farms, irrigation stations and machine tractor stations belong to the state and society. Foreign trade and wholesale trade are also controlled by state organs, and the state shall at least supervise all other commercial circulation.
    The Constitution guarantees the land ownership of working peasants. The Constitution also supports the development of peasants towards the socialist road.
    The Constitution recognizes and protects property acquired through labor, and the Constitution also guarantees the right of inheritance. Of course, private property and private initiatives should not harm public interests.
    Our Constitution declares that serving the cause of socialist construction with one's own labor is the right and glorious duty of every citizen. The basis of labor remuneration is the socialist principle: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his work."
    According to the Constitution, the highest organ of state power is the parliament, and the highest organ of state administration is the Council of Ministers. Members of parliament are elected every four years on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot. Every citizen with the right to vote can be elected as a representative. Every Hungarian citizen, regardless of gender, has the right to vote as long as they reach the legal age, except for enemies of the people and the mentally ill.
    The local organs of state power are the local conferences, and their representatives are also elected by the working people in the manner and conditions prescribed when electing members of parliament.
    Every Hungarian citizen has the right to work and be remunerated for their labor, the right to rest, the right to education, and the right to enjoy subsidies in accordance with social insurance. Citizens of the Hungarian People's Republic are equal before the law. Women enjoy equal rights with men. Marriage and family are protected by law. The Hungarian People's Republic is very concerned about the development of youth and supports scientific work serving the interests of the people. The Constitution guarantees freedom of belief, speech, publication, assembly and association, and guarantees the right of asylum for foreign citizens who are persecuted for engaging in democratic activities. Defending the motherland and the property of the working people is the basic duty of Hungarian citizens.
    The Hungarian people are aware of the importance of the Constitution, doing everything possible to achieve the tasks defined in the Constitution and enjoy the rights defined in the Constitution. The achievements of domestic labor construction are expressed by the achievements of the Three-Year Plan and the Five-Year Plan. At the end of 1949, seven months ahead of schedule, the Hungarian working people not only completed but also overfulfilled the Three-Year Plan. Thus, the Five-Year Plan – the first plan for socialist construction – began on January 1, 1950.
    The elimination of unemployment; the improvement of the living standards of workers; the training of tens of thousands of students in colleges and universities; and the fact that many young people and women have become advanced producers in the past two years all prove that the articles of the Constitution have become a reality. In the past two years, Hungary's development and some international events have better proved that the overall struggle of the world's workers for freedom and socialism is solid and unified. The political, economic and cultural agreements signed by Hungary with the Soviet Union, People's China, and various people's democratic countries, and close cooperation with them, are helping this overall struggle. The struggle of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers against American aggression has become the cause of the Hungarian people themselves. The Hungarian working people are using every opportunity and possibility to express their militant solidarity with the great Chinese people and the Korean people, who are standing at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle.
    Our people will resolutely strike at all offensives of the imperialists and their spies in our country – whether they are Trotskyites, right-wing social democrats, representatives of the reactionary ruling class, or the reactionary church. Not long ago, the trial of Glatz and the unity of the Hungarian working people in opposing these American spies who attempted to turn back the wheel of history were evidence of the Hungarian people's political growth. The labor competition launched throughout the country to celebrate August 20 also proves this.

### 匈牙利宪法节

　　匈牙利宪法节
    匈牙利人民共和国政府司法部长匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会委员  埃里克·莫尔那尔博士
    匈牙利劳动人民，在帝国主义侵略加剧和以苏联为首的和平阵营力量增长的形势下，来庆祝自己宪法节的二周年。一九四九年八月二十日，匈牙利人民的第一个成文宪法由议会通过了。这是匈牙利人民共和国的根本大法，它巩固了从苏联解放我国后迄当时为止我国人民所达到的成就，同时指出进一步发展的远景。匈牙利人民的宪法体现着保卫和平的意志。这一根本大法巩固了劳动人民的政权，并为匈牙利民族各种问题的解决指出了道路。
    过去数千年都未能实现的事，由匈牙利人民民主政权依照着苏联的经验，在共产主义者的政党——匈牙利劳动人民党领导之下，于解放后的五年之内实现了。在宪法的引言中指出，由于苏联的全世界历史性的胜利，匈牙利人民从德国法西斯和国内地主、大资本家反人民的国家政权的羁绊下解放了出来。苏联使我国有可能沿着人民民主的道路向社会主义迈进，从那时起，苏联就以它的兄弟般的援助和社会主义建设的丰富经验，在各方面帮助匈牙利的劳动人民。
    宪法说，匈牙利是人民共和国，是工人和劳动农民在工人阶级领导下的国家。在这个国家中，社会制度的基础是劳动，同时全部权力都属于劳动人民。匈牙利人民共和国为反对一切人剥削人的制度而斗争。生产资料的基本部分在劳动人民的国家的手中或在合作社手中，劳动人民彻底建设着社会主义的经济制度。
    宪法说，地下蕴藏、矿山和大工业企业，交通和运输工具，国营农场，灌溉机站和机器拖拉机站，都属于国家与社会。国外贸易及批发贸易也由国家机关掌握，而其余一切商业流通，国家至少要实行监督。
    宪法保证劳动农民的土地所有权。宪法同时支持农民向社会主义道路上的发展。
    宪法承认和保护以劳力获得的财产，宪法并保障继承权。当然，私有财产和私人倡议不应该损害公共利益。
    我们的宪法宣称，以自己的劳动服务于社会主义建设事业，是每个公民的权利和光荣的义务。劳动报酬的基础是社会主义的这一原则：“各尽所能，按劳取酬。”
    依照宪法，国家权力的最高机关是议会，而国家管理的最高机关为部长会议。议会议员，在普遍、平等和直接选举权的基础上，由秘密投票法每四年选举一次。每一个有选举权的公民均可被选为代表。每一个匈牙利公民，不分性别，只要达到法定年龄都有选举权。人民公敌和精神病患者除外。
    国家权力的地方机关为地方会议，其代表也是由劳动人民像选举议会议员时所规定的方法与条件选举出来的。
    每一个匈牙利公民均有劳动权并按其劳动给予报酬，公民有休息权、受教育权以及按照社会保险享受津贴的权利。匈牙利人民共和国的公民在法律面前一律平等。妇女享有与男子平等的权利。婚姻与家庭受法律的保护。匈牙利人民共和国非常关切青年的发展并支持为人民利益服务的科学工作。宪法保证信仰、言论、出版、集会与结社的自由，同时保证因进行民主活动而被迫害的外国公民的避难权。保卫祖国和劳动人民的财产，则是匈牙利公民的基本义务。
    匈牙利人民意识到宪法的重要性，尽一切力量争取实现宪法中所确定的任务并享用宪法中所确定的权利。国内劳动建设的成就由三年计划和五年计划的成就表示了出来。一九四九年底，在原定日期的前七个月，匈牙利劳动人民不仅完成而且还超额完成了三年计划。于是从一九五○年一月一日就开始执行五年计划——社会主义建设的第一个计划。
    失业现象的消灭；劳动者生活水平的提高；高等学校和大学中培养着数万学生；许多青年和妇女，在过去两年中都成为生产先进者；这一切都证明宪法的各条都已成为现实。近二年来，匈牙利的发展和一些国际事件，更好地证明，全世界劳动者争取自由与社会主义的总斗争是坚固而统一的。匈牙利与苏联、人民中国和各人民民主国家所签订的政治、经济和文化方面的协定以及与它们密切合作，都帮助着这个总斗争。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军反对美国侵略的斗争，已成为匈牙利人民的本身事业。匈牙利劳动人民利用一切机会和可能，表示着与站在反帝国主义斗争前线的伟大的中国人民和朝鲜人民的战斗的团结。
    我国人民将坚决打击帝国主义者及其在我国的间谍的一切进攻——不论他们是托洛茨基分子、右翼社会民主党人、反动统治阶级或反动教会的代表。不久以前，对格拉兹的审讯和匈牙利劳动人民在反对这些企图倒转历史车轮的美国间谍时的团结一致，便是匈牙利人民政治成长的证据。全国为庆祝八月二十日所展开的劳动竞赛，也证明了这一点。
