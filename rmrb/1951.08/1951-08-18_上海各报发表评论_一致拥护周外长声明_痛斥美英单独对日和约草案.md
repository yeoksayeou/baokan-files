Xinhua News Agency Report: Shanghai's Xinwen Ribao and Dagong Bao have both published commentaries, warmly endorsing the statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government on the 15th regarding the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference.

    Shanghai Xinwen Ribao's commentary said: Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn and powerful statement is an exercise of the legitimate right to speak by the major country in the war against Japan that fought the longest, sacrificed the most, and contributed the most; it represents the just voice of the billion people of Asia who have suffered from Japanese imperialism. It has the mighty Sino-Soviet alliance as its backing; it gains the support of peace-loving people around the world. Whoever dares to disregard this statement and act willfully will be met with a bloody nose.

    Shanghai Dagong Bao's commentary said: The content of the US-UK "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" is utterly absurd. It is entirely for the sake of the United States' exclusive occupation of Japan as a military base and the rearmament of Japan to prepare for new wars. This is not only illegal but also completely sinful, and it is absolutely intolerable to us. Foreign Minister Zhou pointed out: "In reality, this is a treaty preparing for a new war, not a genuine peace treaty." This assertion is irrefutable. The commentary concluded: The steps of US imperialism in preparing for a new war are becoming increasingly urgent. All Chinese people must heighten their vigilance, unite all peace-loving people in Asia and even the world, and strive to crush all war conspiracies of US imperialism.

　　上海各报发表评论
    一致拥护周外长声明
    痛斥美英单独对日和约草案
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上海新闻日报、大公报均发表评论，热烈拥护中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长于十五日发表的关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的声明。
    上海新闻日报评论说：周外长发表的严正而有力的声明，是行使着奋斗最久、牺牲最大、贡献最多的对日作战主要国家的合法的发言权；是代表着受过日本帝国主义侵略的十亿亚洲人民的正义的声音。它有强大无比的中苏同盟作后盾；它获得全世界爱好和平人民的支持。谁敢漠视这个声明，而一意孤行，谁就会碰得头破血流。
    上海大公报评论说：美英《对日和约草案》的内容，荒谬绝伦。它完全是为了美国独占日本为军事基地，并重新武装日本以准备新的战争，这不但非法，且完全是罪恶的，是我们所绝对不能容忍的。周外长指出：“实际上这是一个准备新的战争的条约，并非真正的和平条约。”这一论断，是无可辩驳的。评论最后说：美帝国主义准备新的战争的步骤愈来愈急了，全中国人民必须提高警惕，团结全亚洲以至全世界爱好和平的人民，为粉碎美帝国主义的一切战争阴谋而奋斗。
