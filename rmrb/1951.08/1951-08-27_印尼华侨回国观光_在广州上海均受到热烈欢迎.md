This was followed by a speech by Song Zhongquan, head of the Indonesian Overseas Chinese Sightseeing Group. He said: The 2.5 million overseas Chinese in Indonesia love their motherland and are eager to return to see the new face of the people's motherland. We are returning to the motherland with the love of all the overseas Chinese in Indonesia, and we must convey the care of the people of the motherland and the great progress of the motherland to every overseas Chinese.
During their stay in Guangzhou, the sightseeing group visited factories, schools, and the new rural areas in the suburbs after the completion of land reform. They also held discussions with model workers from factories and emancipated peasants from the suburbs. The sightseeing group members were deeply moved by the warm welcome from people from all walks of life. They said, "In the past, when we returned to China, we were subjected to extortion and bullying wherever we went; now we are warmly welcomed and cared for everywhere, and we truly feel the warmth of the motherland."
