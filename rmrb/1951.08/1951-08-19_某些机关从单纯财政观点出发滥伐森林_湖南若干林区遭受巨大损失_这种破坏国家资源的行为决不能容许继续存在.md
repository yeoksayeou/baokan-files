Oppose Waste of Timber, Oppose Indiscriminate Logging!

　　Certain Organizations, Proceeding from a Purely Financial Viewpoint, Indiscriminately Log Forests
    Hunan Province Suffers Huge Losses in Several Forest Areas
    Such Behavior that Destroys National Resources Must Not Be Allowed to Continue
    The Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau and certain local government cadres hold a purely financial viewpoint and do not care about the rational felling and utilization of forests, causing forest damage and huge losses to the country.

    The Provincial Forestry Bureau Uses Forest Wood to Earn High Profits
    Increased the Costs of National Industrial and Mining Enterprises
    Reduced Farmers' Interest in Afforestation and Forest Protection
    In March of this year, the Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau signed a contract with the Central South China Wood Supply Station of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, stipulating a price of 360,000 yuan per cubic meter of wood delivered at Dahebian. If delivered to the railway station, an additional 60,000 yuan for transportation would be added, totaling 420,000 yuan per cubic meter of wood. The Forestry Bureau immediately assigned this "task" to the Chenzhou Forest Area Management Office in the form of contracted felling and procurement, distributing it to various districts and villages. However, the mountain price, felling and processing wages, and land and water transportation costs added up to at least 145,000 yuan per cubic meter. In this way, the Forestry Bureau obtained a profit of more than 100% per cubic meter of wood. Later, because various places were unable to complete the task on schedule, the Forestry Bureau signed a contract with the Cooperation Section of the Linxiang County People's Government for 150,000 pit props (equivalent to approximately 6,000 cubic meters) at a price of 220,000 yuan per cubic meter, with the Cooperation Section of the Linxiang County People's Government responsible for delivering them to the Ministry of Fuel Industry. The County Cooperation Section then posted a price to purchase from the masses. The masses delivered the pit props to the railway station, where the County Cooperation Section directly handed them over to the Central South China Wood Supply Station of the Ministry of Fuel Industry. The Ministry of Fuel Industry paid 420,000 yuan per cubic meter of pit props, while the masses received less than 220,000 yuan (the Cooperation Section also charged a 5% fee), and the Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau, without handling a single pit prop or even seeing one, earned 200,000 yuan per cubic meter. The masses felled their own timber, which they had managed for decades, peeled it, made it into pit props, and carried it on their shoulders for miles or even dozens of miles to the railway station for delivery. If the specifications met the requirements and passed inspection, they received less than 220,000 yuan per cubic meter. If the specifications did not meet the requirements, the Ministry of Fuel Industry would not accept them, and they could only be sold as firewood, earning only 500 to 1,000 yuan per piece. Because the mountain price paid to farmers for the purchase of wood was too low, it affected their interest in afforestation and forest protection. With this method of procurement, it is very difficult to expect farmers to engage in afforestation and forest protection. On the other hand, although the allocated price is formally lower than the market price (the market price is unreasonable), because the forest owner, the farmer, receives very little income, the profit earned by the Forestry Bureau is very large. This is equivalent to making money from the farmers and state-owned enterprises. In fact, this not only affects the income of farmers, but also increases the costs of national industrial and mining enterprises, which is detrimental to national economic construction.

    Shaoyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office Uses Timber for Trading
    Violates Forestry Policies by Unauthorized Large-Scale Felling
    Forces Low-Price Purchases and High-Price Resales
    The Shaoyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Hunan Province more blatantly uses timber for business, illegally felling and purchasing timber, causing serious losses to the country. At a meeting of the Hunan Provincial Finance and Economics Committee in early June, in order to resolve disputes between local governments and forestry agencies, it was decided that local governments should sell all existing timber to the Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau at a fixed price. At that time, the Deputy Commissioner of the Shaoyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office proposed at the meeting that the Shaoyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office had 30,000 liang of existing timber (each liang is generally converted to 1.2 to 1.6 cubic meters) and was willing to sell it to the Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau.

    On June 16, the Deputy Commissioner reached an agreement with the Director of the Forestry Bureau to sell 30,000 liang of timber to the Forestry Bureau at a price of 700,000 yuan per liang. It was also stipulated that at least 25,000 liang should be delivered before the end of this year, barring special circumstances, and the remaining 5,000 liang should be fully delivered by the end of April 1952 at the latest.

    After returning to Shaoyang, the Deputy Commissioner immediately froze and detained all timber in the prefecture, including timber felled by the Dongkou Forestry Station of the Forestry Bureau, forcibly purchasing it at a low price and then reselling it to the Forestry Bureau at a high price. In order to complete this "task," the Shaoyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, in addition to purchasing, also arranged for various counties to carry out felling.

    The numbers for purchase and felling assigned by the Shaoyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office to lower levels was 40,000 liang, which was 10,000 liang more than the task sold to the Forestry Bureau. The Finance and Economics Committee of the Prefectural Commissioner's Office assigned the task to various counties, requiring them to report the quantity of timber already purchased and still available for purchase before the end of October of this year, and requiring all counties to conduct in-depth surveys in forest areas and formulate felling plans. The task assigned to Wugang County was 10,000 liang. In addition to carrying out purchases, felling has also been arranged. As a result, order in the forest area is disrupted, and the forestry station is unable to control it.

    The above facts show that the Shaoyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office initially did not have 30,000 liang of existing timber, but first agreed with the Forestry Bureau and then tried every means to obtain timber in order to satisfy the purpose of making money. This unauthorized felling and unauthorized purchase of timber is a serious violation of forestry policies; taking timber as a business is even more wrong.

    Huitong County People's Government Blindly Fells Timber
    Seriously Damages Forests, Wastes National Resources
    Infringes on Farmers' Interests, Arousing Public Dissatisfaction
    In order to solve local financial problems, the Huitong County People's Government in Hunan Province mobilized the masses to fell timber in the county, seriously damaging forests and infringing on farmers' interests.

    In April of this year, the Huitong County People's Government sent cadres to the county's First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Districts to mobilize the masses to fell large quantities of timber. Most of the trees felled were privately owned, but the forest owners were not paid mountain prices. In addition, the timber confiscated from landlords, despots, and bandits by the Qinglangping Township Farmers' Association was transported away without compensation, forcing farmers to raft them to Hongjiang. The Guangping Forestry Station sent cadres to investigate this matter several times, but the county repeatedly denied that there was any felling of timber. It was not until June, when the Xiangxi Administrative Office convened an expanded forestry meeting and decided that all timber felled by various counties should be sold to the Provincial Forestry Bureau at a fixed price, that the county handed over 80,000 fir timber strips felled this year.

    In order to expand its financial resources, the Huitong County People's Government, without the approval of the forestry authorities, arbitrarily felled timber, violating the instructions of the Government Administration Council. The county, solely to meet local financial needs, did not pay attention to whether it was damaging the forest in the felling process. As a result, some of the timber felled was unusable young trees, the forest was damaged, and national resources were wasted. As for the uncompensated felling of privately owned timber, it not only infringes on private property rights and dampens the enthusiasm of private afforestation, but also infringes on the fruits of victory of the emancipated farmers, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the farmers.

    The leading organs of Central South China and Hunan Province have begun to correct the above-mentioned acts that violate the policies and laws of the Government Administration Council regarding timber. In order to effectively prevent and stop the waste of national timber resources, the struggle against this illegal behavior must be resolutely carried out to the end!

　　某些机关从单纯财政观点出发滥伐森林
    湖南若干林区遭受巨大损失
    这种破坏国家资源的行为决不能容许继续存在
    湖南省林业局及某些地方政府干部存在着单纯财政观点，不关心森林的合理采伐利用，使森林遭受破坏，造成国家的巨大损失。
    省林业局利用林木赚取高利
    提高了国家工矿企业的成本
    减低了农民造林护林的兴趣
    湖南省林业局于今年三月与中央燃料工业部中南区木材供应总站订立了合同，规定以每立方公尺木材三十六万元的价格在大河边交货，若运至火车站交货则另加运费六万元，每立方公尺木材合计四十二万元。林业局当即把这“任务”用包工采伐与收购方式布置在郴州林区管理处，分配到各区村去。可是，山价、砍伐制材工资及水陆运费等合计起来，有少至每立方公尺十四万五千多元的。这样，林业局每立方公尺木材就获得百分之百以上的利润。后来因各地都不能如期完成任务，于是林业局又向临湘县人民政府合作科以每立方公尺二十二万元的价格订了十五万根坑木的合同（约合六千立方公尺），由临湘县人民政府合作科负责交给燃料工业部。县合作科于是挂出牌价，向群众收购。群众送至火车站，由县合作科直接交给中央燃料工业部中南区木材供应总站。每立方公尺的坑木，燃料工业部出的价格是四十二万元，群众所得到的不到二十二万元（合作科还要从中收百分之五的费用），而湖南省林业局并没有经手一根坑木，连坑木的面也没见，就每立方公尺赚二十万元。群众砍伐自己经营了数十年的林木，剥了皮，制成坑木，再用双肩抬到几里甚至几十里以外的火车站上交货。若规格符合，验得上，所得到的是每立方公尺不到二十二万元，若规格不符，燃料工业部不收，则只有卖作柴火，每根仅得到五百元至一千多元。由于收购木材时给农民山价过低，影响了农民对于造林护林的兴趣。用这种收购方式，再要希望农民去造林与护林，那是很困难的。另一方面，在调拨价上形式上虽然低于市价（市价是不合理的），但因为实际上森林所有者农民收入部分极少，林业局所赚利润部分是很大的。这等于从农民及国家企业部门赚钱。这样实际上不但影响农民的收益，而且也提高了国家工矿企业的成本，不利于国家经济建设。
    邵阳专署拿木材作买卖
    违反林业政策擅自大量采伐
    强迫以低价收买以高价转卖
    湖南省邵阳专署更明显地拿木材作生意，违法采伐和收购木材，造成国家严重损失。今年六月初，湖南省财政经济委员会会议上，为解决地方政府与林业机关的纠纷，曾决定由地方政府将所有的陈木作价卖给湖南省林业局。当时邵阳专署副专员在会上提出，邵阳专署有陈木三万两（按每两码通常折合一·二——一·六立方公尺），愿意卖给湖南省林业局。
    六月十六日该副专员与林业局局长取得协议，以每两木材作价七十万元，将三万两木材卖给林业局。并规定在今年年底以前，如无特殊情况，最少交二万五千两，其余五千两，最迟在一九五二年四月底以前全数交清。
    该副专员回到邵阳后，即将该专区内所有的木材，连同林业局洞口林业所采伐的木材，完全冻结扣留，强以低价收买，然后以高价转卖林业局。邵阳专署为完成这个“任务”，除收购外，还布置了各县进行采伐。
    邵阳专署向下布置的收购与采伐数字是四万两，比卖给林业局的任务还要多出一万两。该专署财政经济委员会将任务分配到各县，限各县于今年十月底以前，将已经收购的以及还可以收购的木材数量汇报，并要求各县深入林区调查，作出采伐计划。武冈县分配的任务是一万两，除进行收购外，已布置了采伐。因此林区秩序紊乱，林业所无法掌握。
    上列事实说明了邵阳专署最初并没有陈木三万两，而是先答应了林业局，再来多方设法，打尽主意，取得木材，以满足赚钱的目的。这种对木材的擅自采伐与擅自收购，已是严重违反林业政策的行为；拿木材作生意，更是错误。
    会同县人民政府盲目砍伐林木
    严重破坏森林浪费国家资源
    侵犯农民利益引起群众不满
    湖南省会同县人民政府为了解决地方财政问题，在该县境内发动群众砍伐木材，严重破坏了森林，并侵犯农民利益。
    会同县人民政府于今年四月间即派干部到该县所属第一、四、五、六区发动群众，大量砍伐木材。所砍树木大部为私人所有，但对林主却不付山价。此外又无偿地将清郎坪乡农会没收地主恶霸和土匪的木材运走，强迫农民代为扎牌流放到洪江。广平林业所对此事曾数次派干部前往调查，但该县竟一再否认有砍伐木材的事情。一直到六月间，湘西行署召开扩大林业会议，决定各县所砍伐之木材，一律作价售予省林业局后，该县才交出今年砍伐的杉木条子八万根。
    会同县人民政府为了扩大财源，未经林业机关批准，擅自砍伐木材，违反了政务院的指示，该县单纯为了满足地方财政需要，故未注意在砍伐中是破坏森林，以致所砍伐的木材中，有一部分木材是不合用的幼小树木，森林遭到破坏，浪费了国家的资源。至于无偿砍伐私有林木，不但侵犯了私有权，打击了私人造林的积极性，而且侵犯了翻身农民的胜利果实，引起农民普遍不满。
    对于以上这些违犯政务院关于木材的政策法令的行为，中南区及湖南省领导机关已开始进行纠正。为了有效地防止和制止对国家木材资源的浪费，必须把反对这种犯法行为的斗争坚决进行到底！
