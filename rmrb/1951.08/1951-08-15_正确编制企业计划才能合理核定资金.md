Clearing Assets, Verifying Funds, Opposing Waste!

　　Correctly Compiling Enterprise Plans is the Key to Reasonably Verifying Funds
Central Heavy Industry Department Office Deputy Director Cui Zhong

According to the decision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, state-owned enterprises nationwide have begun the work of clearing assets and verifying funds. This work is of epoch-making significance for the improvement of the management of state-owned enterprises, and we should make sufficient efforts to do it well.

The directly subordinate factories and mines in the North China region of the Central Heavy Industry Department carried out the work of fund verification in May and June [Note]. Based on the results of the work, we affirmed a basic experience: the verification of funds must be closely combined with the compilation of enterprise plans; or, only by correctly compiling enterprise plans can we reasonably verify funds—especially working capital.

The enterprise plan is a concrete plan for all the production and economic activities of the enterprise, which includes the working capital required to complete a certain production task. Fixed assets must also be verified according to the enterprise plan. The enterprise plan is compiled by the enterprise according to the production tasks stipulated by the state. The process of compiling the plan is also the process of calculating the amount of funds required. Therefore, the key to verifying funds lies in the enterprise.

Clearing assets (including inventory, valuation, and registration procedures) is the basis for verifying funds, and one of the preparatory steps for verifying funds. The product plan in the enterprise plan is the basis for verifying funds. Therefore, the preparation work for compiling the plan and the compilation of the product plan are also preparatory steps for verifying funds. These two preparatory steps for verifying funds can be carried out simultaneously in the enterprise. Both clearing assets and compiling plans are quite complex and detailed tasks, both of which take several months. The former can be presided over by the accounting department and the supply department, while the latter is presided over by the planning department. Enterprises that have not yet established planning departments must be established quickly. If it is indeed difficult to establish them in a short period of time, the production management department can temporarily handle it, but a dedicated person should also be designated to be responsible.

In the verification of funds, the verification of fixed assets is relatively easy, and the verification of working capital is relatively difficult. Whether the fund verification is reasonable or not, the key to the former mainly lies in whether the valuation is correct, and the key to the latter mainly lies in whether the unit consumption quota of the product is reasonable and whether the various reserve quotas are practical. Therefore, as a process of verification work, the former has a simpler problem, while the latter has a more complex problem. To make this work go smoothly, attention must be paid to two aspects: one is to overcome ideological obstacles and establish an overall concept; the other is to grasp the important key in the work.

            I. On the Verification of Fixed Assets

Article 7 of the "Provisional Measures for Verifying Funds of State-Owned Enterprises" issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council stipulates that the principle for verifying fixed assets is that "the minimum necessary fixed assets (including the reserve part for this year) should be calculated according to the production tasks given by the state in 1951, according to the production organization, equipment capacity, and in combination with technical and economic quotas. This asset is listed as a used fixed asset, and all unused and fixed assets that are not needed by the unit at all should be listed as separate asset subjects, and detailed inventories should be made separately, and reported level by level to the superior."

Some people think that fixed assets should not be changed every year, that is, they should be increased if the task is larger, and vice versa. Therefore, they think that the above principle is not very appropriate. This view is inappropriate and does not conform to the current actual situation of enterprises. The fixed assets currently held by state-owned enterprises generally have the above three types, namely, those that are used, those that are not used, and those that are not needed at all. Everyone has no objection to dividing out the fixed assets that are not needed at all and handing them over to the state for disposal. There are different opinions on dividing out the temporarily unused fixed assets and not treating them as the fixed assets of the enterprise. Some comrades are afraid that the state will take it away (referring to what can be taken away), which will hinder the development of the enterprise. This consideration is unnecessary. Because, if the unused fixed assets are also listed as the fixed assets of the enterprise, depreciation fees and major repair funds must be withdrawn as usual, which will increase the product cost and hinder the operation of the enterprise. Moreover, the state generally does not take away unused fixed assets, except when it is necessary to meet the needs of another plan. Even if it is taken away, it conforms to the overall plan of the country and should be obeyed.

The basis for verifying fixed assets is the production task of the enterprise. What needs to be explained here is that the enterprise's product plan may differ from the state's original annual production task (that is, the production control figures) (generally higher than the production control figures). The enterprise compiles its own plan according to the production control figures stipulated by the state (the so-called state-stipulated control figures are actually proposed by the enterprise and approved level by level). The plan can exceed the control figures (but it is not allowed to be lower than the control figures except with special permission). The approval of the plan also means that the enterprise's production task is finally determined. At present, some enterprises may not have compiled a plan according to this procedure, and may think that the verification of fixed assets is only based on the state's original production task. If this is done, there may be a reduction in the fixed assets being used in enterprises where production efficiency has been improved, and this situation is generally not appropriate (this is only done when production must be restricted). Therefore, enterprises should compile a product plan according to the production capacity already achieved, and after being approved by the state, use it as the basis for verifying fixed assets.

Verifying fixed assets will inevitably divide out a batch of unused fixed assets (surplus production equipment, unfinished or completed but not put into production construction projects, etc.). Unused fixed assets do not accrue depreciation and major repair funds, but they must be maintained. Therefore, the source of maintenance expenses should be stipulated in a timely manner. Our approach is for the enterprise to compile a maintenance plan, which is approved by the state and allocated funds. This issue is of great importance, and failure to determine it in advance will cause losses to these assets.

            II. On the Verification of Working Capital

The verification of working capital is the main part of the verification of enterprise funds, and it is also a difficult part to do. The comrades in the enterprise should be required to grasp it seriously and responsibly. Calculating the required amount of working capital through the compilation of enterprise plans is a formal working procedure. Our central task of deploying directly subordinate enterprises in May and June was "compiling plans and verifying funds." Here are a few key points we have learned in this work:

            1. Formulate working capital control figures for each enterprise

It is beneficial for the superior authorities (administration bureaus and the Ministry of Industry) to stipulate a working capital control figure for subordinate enterprises before carrying out fund verification. How should the control figure be stipulated? ① Based on the enterprise's 1950 final accounts, find out the turnover of working capital last year; ② Based on the estimate of this year's production plan and supply and marketing situation, find out the approximate turnover rate of working capital. Divide the total cost of the whole year's products by this turnover rate to get the approximate amount of working capital needed. The benefit of proposing a working capital control figure from top to bottom is that both the enterprise and its leading authorities have a rough idea, and it can be regarded as a maximum limit to prevent excessive deviations from occurring. The enterprise's attitude towards the control figure should be to strive for a reduction that meets the actual needs during the calculation process, and should not be to "make up the number." "Making up enough numbers" or striving for more should be opposed.

            2. Vigorously carry out the preparation work for compiling enterprise plans

The enterprise plan consists of the following plans: product plan, labor plan, raw material supply plan, cost plan, product sales plan, basic construction plan, and financial plan. The product plan is the basis of the enterprise plan. The preparation work should focus on the following aspects:

    1. Determine the main quotas. ① Quotas for product categories, quantity and quality. The production task stipulated by the state for the enterprise is currently only the main product of the enterprise. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the state only stipulates the production task of pig iron; and the plant's products are diverse. The products that leave the factory are pig iron castings, coking by-products, etc., and the products required by the enterprise itself are coke, electricity, etc. The quantity and quality quotas of all products must be determined before compiling the plan, and approved by the superior as the basis for the entire plan. ② The consumption quota of main raw materials should be carefully reviewed and approved by the superior. ③ The consumption quota of auxiliary materials should also be fully considered in advance to prevent omissions or being too unrealistic. ④ Personnel quota, raw material reserve quota, product work-in-progress and semi-finished product quota, etc., should be fully studied in advance.

    2. Collect and sort out various basic data and compile annex tables. The enterprise's planning department (or the production management department if there is no planning department) should systematically organize all departments to fully prepare before starting to compile the plan. The main task is to sort out the original records and basic data of each workshop, and the improvement data of advanced workers and technical departments in the workshop, and compile various annex tables required for the plan. Otherwise, it is difficult to compile the labor plan and cost plan.

    3. Establish a unified leadership responsibility organization. Compiling a plan is a very large organizational work, and there must be a unified leadership organization to serve as the core for comprehensive consideration and overall control, so that the work can be carried out in an orderly manner. Therefore, the planning department should take overall charge, combine with accounting, supply and marketing, labor (or personnel) and other work departments and personnel in each workshop, and divide the work to cooperate. Otherwise, delays and waiting for work may occur, or several departments will compile their own plans, resulting in inconsistent figures, wasting energy, and inevitably rework.

    4. Carry out ideological education on economic accounting system among all employees; and mobilize the masses to participate in the preparation work of compiling the plan. The quantity and quality of products, and various consumption quotas must be discussed by the masses to have practical significance, and the collection of various data must also rely on the masses.

            3. Pay attention to overcoming various ideological obstacles

In the work of compiling plans and verifying funds, some ideological obstacles will be encountered. This thinking is basically a tendency of departmentalism. The People's Daily editorial on July 30 pointed out that "ideological struggle should be launched in the verification of funds," which is very correct. According to our experience, this ideological obstacle is expressed in different forms, mainly in the three aspects of supply, production, and sales.

In the production aspect: attention should be paid to preventing and overcoming the conservative tendency in determining the consumption quota of raw materials and the personnel quota. From workshop workers to enterprise leaders, they are generally clear and positive in their thinking on increasing output and ensuring quality. However, the requirements for various consumption quotas and personnel are generally inclined to be relaxed (that is, adopting the safest figures). They think that this can ensure the completion of the cost plan without danger, and can foresee the possibility of reducing costs, so that employees can obtain a certain amount of over-cost plan rewards. The essence of this way of thinking is to some extent to oppose the interests of the state and the interests of the enterprise to the interests of the individual, so it should be opposed. The correct principle for determining these quotas should be to adopt "average advanced quotas." Enterprise leaders must ensure that the planned cost does not exceed the realized actual cost. If there is a tendency to relax the quota, this possibility will arise.

In the supply aspect: attention should be paid to preventing and overcoming the tendency to relax the reserve quota of various raw materials. This way of thinking mainly occurs among enterprise leaders and supply workers and workshop staff. The specific content is the "insurance" thinking of "allowing a large margin for safety" and "preparing for drought and famine." The specific manifestations are: a general requirement for an insurance reserve period, and extending the duration of the insurance period; in addition, the purchase interval and transportation time are longer than the actual situation. The result is an increase in the reserve quota. The purpose of this tendency is to ensure production. There are historical roots for this way of thinking, such as the blockade during the war in the past, the fluctuation of prices, and the impact of railway transportation on the normal supply of enterprises due to urgent military needs. The irregular material supply system in enterprises and the lack of planning are the direct causes of this tendency. Regarding the control of this aspect, we believe that: ① The principle of realistic calculation should be grasped; there should be an appropriate insurance amount, but there is no need for additional insurance. ② One should not over-accommodate certain unreasonable facts currently existing in the enterprise, but should actively improve and strengthen the planning of supply work. ③ In procurement work, the importance of the contract system should be emphasized, and efforts should be made to guarantee supply by contract as much as possible.

In the sales aspect: attention should be paid to preventing and overcoming the tendency to relax the product inventory quota. The fact that products were stockpiled in the past has become one of the issues that enterprises are most concerned about after the verification of funds. In order to avoid inflexible capital turnover, the requirement to increase the product quota is understandable. However, the sales situation cannot be based entirely on the past, but should be mainly based on the current situation. Enterprises should take the initiative to open up sales channels. Additional planned inventory is of no benefit to the enterprise. In order to properly control this issue, the enterprise's leading authorities should provide the enterprise with the necessary guarantee of the sales plan.

From the ideological obstacles that may occur in the above three aspects of supply, production, and sales, it can be seen that the policy of "combining supply, production, and sales with a developmental perspective" has not yet been reflected in actual actions. And this policy is what all state-owned enterprises and their leading authorities should strive to implement.

In the verification of working capital, the tendency of departmentalism may occur in all aspects, and the above points are only a part of them. The key to overcoming this tendency mainly lies in the leading comrades of the relevant departments of the enterprise. The starting point of these comrades is naturally to ensure the safe production of the enterprise without threat, but it should be understood that more working capital is of no benefit to the enterprise. With more money, the enterprise will naturally store more materials it needs, and will not put the cash away. For example, an enterprise stored too much coal. If the old coal cannot be used up, the new coal will naturally not be used. As a result, the coal self-ignited after being stored for a long time! But it still has to be used. This shows that storing too much is like always eating leftovers, which is not beneficial. Not only that, this approach hinders the enterprise from giving full play to its initiative, increases management difficulties, and easily causes material losses. Therefore, asking for more funds is harmful and useless to the enterprise. Asking for more funds is also of no benefit to the state. This approach does not take care of the overall interests enough. Therefore, in the work of verifying funds, we must attach importance to overcoming ideological obstacles in order to complete the work satisfactorily. All enterprises should take ensuring enterprise production and saving funds for the country as the overall policy. Saving funds is of extremely great significance to the country's economic construction, and we regard it as a glorious task and strive to complete it in the best possible way.

It should be pointed out that the remnants of the "hoarding mentality" still remain in some staff members of the enterprise. In the later period of Kuomintang rule, it caused more than ten years of hyperinflation. At that time, all bureaucratic capital enterprises used "hoarding and speculation" as a way to make exorbitant profits, thus forming a social mentality and style of hoarding. Some of the staff members who used to work in bureaucratic capital enterprises and are now staff members of people's enterprises have not completely eliminated this thinking. "Speculation" is naturally impossible, but "hoarding" still feels necessary. Reflected in the work, it becomes a factor that causes stockpiling; for the verification of funds, it is also easy to have a tendency to ask for more money.

            4. Several major issues that superiors should help and solve

    1. Quickly stipulate the method for extracting factory bonuses. Some state-owned enterprises in North China will implement the economic accounting system from the second half of this year; general enterprises will also start implementing it from next year after the verification of funds. How to extract the factory bonus fund is an issue that all employees of the enterprise hope to determine quickly. In order to encourage the production enthusiasm of employees and consolidate confidence in the implementation of the economic accounting system, we feel that the scope and ratio of bonus extraction should be slightly relaxed in the first year; however, attention should also be paid to the problems of next year and the future, that is, to prevent the bonus from being inappropriately lower than this year in proportion.

    2. Bank credit should cooperate with the development of enterprise production to ensure that the working capital of the enterprise does not encounter difficulties due to increased production. The state can only verify the working capital of enterprises once a year. It is very likely that enterprises will encounter a shortage of funds due to production exceeding the plan in the process of operation in the future. The state banks should stipulate measures to actively provide assistance to enterprises.

    3. Help enterprises deal with the situation of stagnant funds in a timely manner to ensure that all of its due funds are put into production and operation. At present, the state of working capital in various enterprises is unreasonable, and the general manifestation is stockpiling. The formation of this phenomenon has its historical reasons. It was like this when it was taken over, and it has not been fundamentally changed so far. There are long-term stockpiled cold materials, waste materials, defective products, unqualified finished products and finished products. After the verification of funds, it still needs to go through a process of change in order to make the reserves of various materials in the enterprise conform to the plan. We must strive to shorten this process. In order to help enterprises deal with the situation of having too much of this and too little of that in their assets, we have organized a special agency to be responsible for allocation and sales; this work should be gradually carried out during the process of clearing assets.

    ★                      ★                        ★

All state-owned enterprises have made extremely remarkable achievements in democratic reform (of course, referring to the taken-over bureaucratic enterprises) and in developing production, and improving management has become a major task for these enterprises. Our principle is to implement the economic accounting system. In this regard, state-owned enterprises in the Northeast region have accumulated a lot of experience, which will help enterprises that have not yet implemented it to shorten the process of exploration. Clearing assets and verifying funds is the first step in implementing the economic accounting system. Therefore, we should recognize that this work is of epoch-making significance for improving the operation and management of enterprises, and do it well with sufficient efforts.

    [Note] The assets of the directly subordinate factories and mines of the Central Heavy Industry Department were inventoried three times and valued twice in 1949 and 1950. With the consent of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council this year, we carried out fund verification on this basis, with necessary reorganization and key adjustments to unreasonable valuations, so we were able to start as early as May.

### 正确编制企业计划才能合理核定资金

　　正确编制企业计划才能合理核定资金
    中央重工业部办公厅副主任  崔中
    全国国营企业已按照政务院财政经济委员会的决定，开始了清理资产和核定资金的工作。这件工作对于国营企业在经营管理上的改进有着划时期的意义，我们应当以足够的努力把它做好。
    中央重工业部华北区直属厂矿，在五、六两月内进行了核定资金的工作〔注〕。根据工作的结果，我们肯定了一条基本经验，就是核定资金必须与编制企业计划密切结合；或者说只有正确地编制了企业计划，才能够合理地核定资金——尤其是流动资金。
    企业计划，是企业的全部生产活动与经济活动的具体方案，其中就包含了完成一定生产任务所需要的流动资金。固定资金也必须根据企业计划进行核定。企业计划由企业根据国家规定的生产任务编制。编制计划的过程，同时就是计算资金需要量的过程。因之，核定资金的关键在企业。
    清理资产（包括清点、估价和登记等程序）是核定资金的基础，也就是核定资金的准备步骤之一。企业计划中的产品计划则是核定资金的根据。因之，编制计划的准备工作和产品计划的编制也是核定资金的准备步骤。这两项核定资金的准备步骤，在企业中可以同时进行。清理资产和编制计划都是相当复杂和细致的工作，都须花费数月的时间。前者可由会计部门和供应部门主持办理，后者则由计划部门主持办理。尚未建立计划工作部门的企业，必须迅速建立。若确有困难短时尚不能建立者，则可暂由生产管理部门办，但亦应指定专人负责。
    核定资金中，固定资金的核定比较易办，流动资金的核定比较难办。资金核定能否合理，前者的关键主要在于估价是否正确，后者的关键主要在于产品单位消耗定额是否合理及各项储备定额是否切合实际。因之，作为核定工作的过程，前者问题较单纯，后者问题较复杂。要使这一工作顺利进行，必须注意两个方面：其一是克服思想障碍，树立整体观念；其二是掌握住工作中的重要关键。
            一，关于固定资金的核定
    政务院财政经济委员会发布的“国营企业核定资金暂行办法”第七条，规定了核定固定资金的原则是“应根据一九五一年度国家所给予的生产任务，按生产组织，设备能力，结合技术经济定额，计算最低必须保有的固定资产（包括本年度备用部分），此项资产列为使用的固定资产，凡未使用及本单位根本不需用的固定资产，应另列资产科目，分别造具详细清册，逐级审核汇报上级”。
    有人以为固定资产不宜年年变动，即任务大了就增加，反之即减少。因之，他们认为上述原则不甚妥当。这一看法是不妥当的，不切合企业的目前实际情况。国营企业目前所保有的固定资产一般有上述三种，即已使用的、未使用的和根本不需用的。把根本不需用的划分出来，缴给国家处理，大家都无意见。对于把暂时未使用的也划分出来，不做为企业的固定资产，则有不同意见。有的同志惟恐国家把它提走（指能够提走的）有碍本企业的发展。这种考虑是不必要的。因为，如果把未使用的也列为企业的固定资产，则须照例提存折旧费和大修理基金，这就增加了产品成本，妨害企业的经营。而且国家对于未使用的固定资产，除必需满足另一个计划的需要之外，一般是不提走的。纵然提走，也是合乎国家的整个计划的，应该服从。
    核定固定资金的根据，是企业的生产任务。这里要说明的是企业的产品计划可能与国家原定的年度生产任务（即生产控制数字）有出入（一般是高于生产控制数字）。企业根据国家规定的生产控制数字（所谓国家规定控制数字，事实上也是由企业提出，经逐级核准），编制自己的计划。计划可以超过控制数字（但除特别许可外不准低于控制数字）。计划批准，也即是最后确定了企业的生产任务。目前有的企业可能尚未按照这个程序编制计划，可能以为核定固定资金只是根据国家原定的生产任务。如果这样办，在生产效能已经提高的企业里，就有发生核减正在使用的固定资产的可能，而这种情形一般说是不适宜的（只有在必须限产时才这样办）。因之，企业应当按照已经达到的生产能力编制产品计划，经国家批准，并以它作为核定固定资金的根据。
    核定固定资产，势将划分出一批未使用的固定资产（多余的生产装备，未完工或已完工而未投入生产的建筑工程等等）。未使用固定资产既不提存折旧和大修理基金，但必须维护。因之，应当及时规定维护费用的来源。我们的办法是由企业编制维护计划，由国家批准并拨款。这一问题关系甚大，不在事先确定，将使这类资产遭受损失。
            二，关于流动资金的核定
    核定流动资金，是核定企业资金的主要部分，也是难作的部分，应要求企业的同志认真和负责地掌握。通过编制企业计划来计算流动资金的需要量，是正规的工作程序。我们布置直属企业在五、六两月份的中心工作就是“编制计划和核定资金”。兹将我们在这一工作中体会到的几个要点介绍于下：
            一，制定各企业流动资金控制数字
    由上级机关（管理局与工业部）对所属企业在进行核定资金之前先规定一个流动资金控制数字，是有好处的。控制数字怎样规定呢？①根据该企业一九五○年决算，找出去年流动资金的周转情况；②根据今年的生产计划和供销情况的估计，找出流动资金的大概的周转率。以此周转率除全年产品总成本，即得出需要流动资金的约数。自上而下地提出一个流动资金控制数字的好处，是使企业及其领导机关都有一个大概的底子，并且可视为一个最高的限额，以防止发生过大的偏差。企业对于控制数字的态度，应是在计算过程中力求切合实际需要的降低，而不应当是“凑数”。“凑够算数”或力争多要是应当反对的。
            二，大力进行编制企业计划的准备工作
    企业计划由下列各计划构成：产品计划，劳动计划，原材料供应计划，成本计划，产品销售计划，基本建设计划，财务计划。产品计划是企业计划的基础。准备工作应注重以下几个方面：
    １、确定主要定额。①产品品类、数量与质量定额。国家对企业规定的生产任务，目前还只是该企业的主产品。譬如石景山钢铁厂，国家只是规定生铁的生产任务；而该厂的产品则是多样的，作为出厂产品除生铁外还有生铁铸品，炼焦副产品等，为本企业需用的产品则有焦炭、电力等等。所有产品，均需在编制计划之前确定其数量和质量的定额，经上级批准作为全部计划的根据。②主要原材料的消耗定额，应认真审定，并经上级批准。③辅助材料消耗定额亦应事先充分考虑，以防遗漏，或过于不切合实际。④人员定额，原材料储备定额，产品在制品半制品定额等，均需事前充分研究。
    ２、搜集整理各种基本资料，编制附表。企业的计划部门（尚无计划部门者应由生产管理部门负责）应在着手编制计划之前有系统地组织各部门充分准备。主要是整理各车间的原始纪录基层资料，和车间先进职工及技术部门的改进资料，并编制出计划需用的各种附表。否则，劳动计划与成本计划等是很难编制的。
    ３、建立统一领导的责任组织。编制计划是一个很大的组织工作，必须有统一的领导组织，以作为考虑全面、掌握全盘的核心，才能使工作有条不紊。因此，应由计划部门通盘主持，结合会计、供销、劳动（或人事）等工作部门及各车间人员，分工配合进行。不然，就会发生拖延与停工待料的现象，或几个部门各编各的计划，结果数字不对头，徒费精力，势必返工。
    ４、在全体职工中进行经济核算制的思想教育；并发动群众参加编制计划的各项准备工作。产品数量质量、各种消耗定额均需经过群众讨论才有现实意义，各项资料的收集也必须依靠群众进行。
            三，注意克服各种思想障碍
    在编制计划和核定资金工作中，会遇到某些思想障碍。这种思想基本上是本位主义倾向。人民日报七月三十日社论指出“核定资金要展开思想斗争”是非常正确的。根据我们的经验，这种思想障碍分别以不同形式表现出来，主要地表现在供、产、销三个方面。
    在产的方面：要注意防止和克服在确定原材料消耗定额与人员定额上的保守倾向。从车间职工到企业的负责同志，对于提高产量和保证质量，在思想上一般还是明确的和积极的。但对于各项消耗定额和人员的要求，则一般是倾向放宽的（即采用最保险的数字），他们以为这样才可以保证无危险地完成成本计划，并且能够预见降低成本的可能，从而使职工获得一定数量的超成本计划奖励。这种思想倾向的实质，是在某种程度上把国家利益和企业利益与个人利益对立起来的看法，因之是应当反对的。对于确定这些定额的正确原则，应是采取“平均先进定额”。企业领导同志务必掌握不使计划成本超过已实现的实际成本。如果有放宽定额的倾向，就会产生这种可能性。
    在供的方面：要注意防止和克服放宽各项原材料储备定额的倾向。这种思想倾向主要发生在企业的领导同志和供应工作与车间工作人员中。其具体内容即是“宽打窄用”和“防旱备荒”的“保险”思想。具体表现是：普遍要求保险储备期，并延长保险期的时间；另外，则对采购间隔时间和运输时间较实际情况延长。其结果则是加大了储备定额。这种倾向的目的是为了保证生产。产生这种思想倾向是有历史根源的，譬如过去战争时期的封锁，物价的波动，铁路运输因军事急需而影响企业的正常供应等等。企业中材料供应制度的不正规，缺乏计划性，则是促成这种倾向的直接原因。对于这一方面的掌握，我们认为应当：①掌握实事求是的计算的原则；需要有适当的保险额，但不必要额外的保险。②不能过分迁就企业中目前存在的某些不合理事实，而应以积极改进的态度，加强供应工作的计划性。③在采购工作上要强调合同制的重要，尽量争取以合同保证供应。
    在销的方面：要注意防止和克服放宽产品库存定额的倾向。过去产品积压的事实，在核定资金之后就成为企业最关心的问题之一。为了避免资金周转不灵，因而表现增大产品定额的要求是可以理解的。但销售情况不可以完全以过去为根据，而主要应以现实情况为根据。企业应当主动打开销路。额外的计划积存量对企业并无益处。为了适当掌握这一问题，企业的领导机关要给予企业以必要的销售计划的保证。
    从上述供、产、销三个方面可能发生的思想障碍，可以看出是“以发展的观点结合供、产、销”的方针尚未在实际行动中体现出来。而这一方针正是一切国营企业及其领导机关应当努力执行的。
    在核定流动资金中，本位主义的倾向，是可能发生在各个方面的，上列诸点只是其中的一部分。克服这种倾向的关键，主要在于企业的各有关部门的领导同志。这些同志的出发点自然都是为了企业不受胁威地安全生产，但应当了解，流动资金多了对企业并无好处。钱多了，自然多积存企业需用的物资，不会把现款存放起来。如某企业，存储了过多的煤。旧煤用不完，新煤自然不能用。结果，煤存日久而自燃了！但仍不得不用。这说明多积存好像总吃剩饭一样是没有好处的。不仅如此，这种做法是妨碍企业发挥积极性的，并且增加管理上的困难，和易于造成物资的损失。因之，多要资金对企业有害无益。多要资金对国家也无好处。这样做法，是不够照顾整体利益的。因之，在核定资金工作中必须重视克服思想障碍，才能把工作圆满完成。所有企业均应以保证企业生产、为国家节约资金为总的方针。节约资金，对于国家的经济建设有着极其重大的意义，我们视为一项光荣的任务，力求最好地完成。
    应当指出，“囤积思想”的残余尚存留在企业的某些工作人员中。在国民党统治的后期，曾造成了十余年的恶性通货膨胀。在那时，所有的官僚资本企业都以“囤积居奇”为牟取暴利的办法，从而形成了社会性的囤积的思想和作风。过去在官僚资本企业工作而今天已成为人民企业的工作人员中，有的人还未彻底肃清这种思想。“居奇”自然不可能，而“囤积”则还觉得需要。反映在工作中，就成为造成积压的因素；对于核定资金，则同样容易发生多要钱的倾向。
            四，上级应帮助和解决的几个主要问题
    １、迅速规定工厂奖金提取办法。华北某些国营企业自今年下半年起即实行经济核算制；一般企业在核定资金之后，从明年起亦将开始实行。如何提取工厂奖励基金，是企业全体职工希望迅速确定的问题。为了鼓励职工的生产热情及巩固对实行经济核算制的信心，我们觉得在第一年对于规定奖金提取的范围与比额似应略加放宽；但亦应注意到明年以及今后的问题，即防止今后奖金在比例上不宜低于今年。
    ２、银行信贷应配合企业生产的发展，以保证企业的流动资金不因生产提高而发生困难。国家对企业的流动资金只能一年核定一次，企业在经营过程中因生产超过计划而发生资金不足的情况，在今后是十分可能的，国家银行应规定办法主动给企业以援助。
    ３、及时帮助企业处理资金呆滞情况，以保证它应有的资金额全部投入生产和经营。目前各企业流动资金的状况是不合理的，一般的表现是积压。这种现象的形成有其历史的原因，接管时就是如此，至今还未基本上改变。有长期积压的冷料、废料、废品、不合格的成品以及成品。在核定资金之后，还需要经过一个变化过程，才能使企业各项物资的储备符合计划。这个过程必须力争缩短。我们为了帮助企业处理资产上此多彼少的情况，组织了专门的机构负责调拨与销售；此项工作在清理资产的过程中即应逐步展开。

    所有国营企业，在民主改革上（当然是指接收的官僚企业）、在发展生产上都已做出了极其显著的成绩，改进经营就成为这些企业重大任务。我们的原则是实行经济核算制。在这方面，东北区国营企业已有了不少的经验，将可帮助尚未实行的企业缩短摸索的过程。清理资产和核定资金是实行经济核算制的第一步。因之，我们应当认识这一工作对改进企业的经营管理有着划时期的意义，以足够的努力把它做好。
    〔注〕中央重工业部直属厂矿的资产，在一九四九年和一九五○年进行了三次清点和两次估价。今年经政务院财政经济委员会的同意，即以此为基础，加以必要的整理和重点调整不合理的估价，即进行核定资金，所以能提早于五月份开始。
