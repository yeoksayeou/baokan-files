　　Elderly Workers and Peasants in Pingjiang, Hunan, Recall the Autumn Harvest Uprising
Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, is one of the birthplaces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, many elderly workers and peasants in the county who participated in the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927 held a symposium in Jiayi Town, the former site of the New Fourth Army's liaison office in Pingjiang twelve years ago. They recalled the history of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and the later New Fourth Army relying on the masses to carry out heroic revolutionary struggles.

　　Pan Dusheng, an old paper industry worker who participated in the workers' and peasants' guerrilla forces at the time, said: "In September 1927, the people of Pingjiang held the 'Autumn Harvest Uprising.' At that time, Comrade Luo Nachuan and others started with three and a half guns. Taking paper industry workers as the backbone, they took advantage of the opportunity of the Northern and Southern warlords' melee to seize the enemy's guns with their bare hands to arm themselves, expanding the ranks to more than one hundred guns. In February 1928, a meeting of Communist Party activists was held in Jiayi Town, and the Pingjiang-Xiangyin-Yueyang Guerrilla Headquarters, headed by Comrade Luo Nachuan, was established to uniformly command armed actions in various places. This was one of the foundations for establishing the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi revolutionary base area and creating the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army."

　　Old peasant Deng Meisheng also talked about General Peng Dehuai's leadership of uprisings in Pingjiang, Liuyang, and other places. In March 1928, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Guards and guerrillas attacked Pingjiang City, but were unsuccessful. In July, General Peng Dehuai led uprisings in Pingjiang, Liuyang, and other places, rekindling the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers and peasants. Tens of thousands of young workers and peasants joined the uprising troops, which quickly grew into the Fifth Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Tu Jinggao, a peasant who had worked as an orderly in the Fifth Army headquarters at the time, said: "At that time, General Peng Dehuai wore a set of gray uniforms just like the soldiers. He had a black-maned horse, but he rarely rode it himself, always letting the wounded and sick soldiers ride it. When fighting, he always stood at the front, and everyone said he was a 'lone hero.'" He Xianbin, a veteran who left the Red Army due to injury, told a story about a battle at the time: In 1929, a regiment of the reactionary Zhu Yaohua bandit troops invaded the Red Army base area, and the masses sent a message to the Red Army overnight. Based on the intelligence from the masses, the Red Army annihilated the enemy in a surprise attack of one hundred and eighty miles in one day and one night. Many enemies were disarmed and still confused. They said, "Did you fly down from the sky?" The Red Army soldiers laughed and said, "We didn't come from the sky, we came from the masses."

　　Old man Yang Longxing, who had persisted in the struggle with the old Red Army soldiers for many years, recalled the arduous struggle at the time: "If there are iron men in the world, they are the old Red Army soldiers. When they had no houses to live in, they built caves; when they had no food to eat, they found more than twenty kinds of edible wild vegetables and tree roots; when they had no salt, they cut wild honey; when they had no guns, they looked for the enemy." Old man Yang used a proverb to describe the Red Army's bravery and high morale at the time: "The bandit army (referring to the Kuomintang bandit army) can only escape if dried fish can be raised alive."

　　In 1937, the Red Army guerrillas who had persisted in the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi revolutionary base area for a long time after the main force's Long March, and who had been tempered and tested, were reorganized into the First Regiment of the First Detachment of the New Fourth Army under Chairman Mao's call for "united resistance against Japan." After concentrated rectification and training in Jiayi Township, Pingjiang, Comrade Fu Qiutao led them to southern Anhui to fight against Japan. The people attending the symposium looked at the anti-Japanese slogans left by the New Fourth Army on the walls of the meeting place and at the newly built martyrs' tomb in front of the door, and they all remembered the "Pingjiang Massacre" created here by the Kuomintang bandits on June 12, 1939, and the heroic sacrifices of martyrs such as Tu Zhengkun and Luo Ziming. They felt very angry. Jiang Juzong, a young peasant, held up the large cleaver left by his father before his sacrifice and said, "The martyrs' blood was not shed in vain. Our spears and cleavers have now become airplanes and cannons, and our guerrillas have become the invincible People's Liberation Army. We have the strength to avenge the martyrs."

　　He Guang, a representative of the peasants in Jiayi Township, said: "Since Pingjiang's liberation two years ago, the lives of our emancipated peasants have been getting better day by day. This is all thanks to the blood and flesh of the old Red Army and Liberation Army soldiers. We guarantee to complete the township's plan to increase the production and donation of more than 60,000 catties of rice, purchase airplanes and cannons, strengthen national defense, and defend our happy life. In order to welcome the 24th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, we must also do a good job in farming for the families of soldiers and resolutely suppress all lurking counter-revolutionaries to repay Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the old Red Army for their kindness."

### 湖南平江年老工人和农民回忆秋收起义

　　湖南平江年老工人和农民回忆秋收起义
    湖南平江县是中国人民解放军的发源地之一。该县许多参加过一九二七年秋收起义的年老的工人和农民，“八一”节前夕在十二年前新四军驻平江通讯处的所在地嘉义镇举行座谈会，回忆当年中国工农红军和后来的新四军依靠群众进行英勇的革命斗争的历史。
    参加过当时的工农游击队的老纸业工人潘度生说：“一九二七年九月，平江人民举行‘秋收起义’，那时罗纳川等同志是用三枝半枪起家的。他们以纸业工人为骨干，利用南北军阀混战时机，赤手空拳夺取敌人的枪枝，武装自己，使队伍壮大到有一百多枝枪。一九二八年二月，在嘉义镇举行了一个共产党员活动分子会议，成立了以罗纳川同志为首的平（江）湘（阴）岳（阳）游击司令部，统一指挥各地武装行动。这就是以后建立湘鄂赣根据地、创造中国工农红军的基础之一。”
    老农民邓美盛也谈了当年彭德怀将军领导平江、浏阳等地起义的情形。一九二八年三月，工农赤卫队和游击队进攻平江城，没有成功。七月间，彭德怀将军领导平江、浏阳等地的起义，重新发动了工农群众的革命热情，成千成万个青年工人和农民参加了起义部队，这些起义的部队很快壮大为中国工农红军第五军。当时曾在第五军军部做过勤务员的农民涂镜高说：“那时彭德怀将军跟士兵一样穿一套灰制服。他有一匹黑鬃马，自己很少骑，总是给伤病员骑。打起仗来，他总是站在最前面，大家都说他是个‘独胆英雄’。”因为负伤而脱离红军的老战士何贤斌谈了一个当时的战斗故事：一九二九年反动派朱耀华匪部一团人进犯红军根据地，群众漏夜送信给红军。红军根据群众的情报，以一天一夜一百八十里的奔袭，全歼了敌人。许多敌人被缴了枪还莫名其妙，他们说：“你们从天上飞来的？”红军战士笑着说：“我们不是从天上来的，是从群众中来的。”
    曾经和老红军战士在一起坚持多年斗争的杨龙兴老汉，回忆当年的艰苦斗争说：“假如世界上有钢铁人，那就是老红军战士。他们没屋住，打岩洞；没饭吃，找了二十多种可吃的野菜和树根；没食盐，割野蜂蜜；没枪，找敌人。”杨老汉用一句谚语形容当时红军的英勇和高昂的士气说：“匪军（指国民党匪军）逃得脱，除非干鱼养得活。”
    一九三七年，在主力长征后长期坚持湘鄂赣根据地、经过千锤百炼的红军游击队，在毛主席“一致抗日”的号召下，改编为新四军第一支队第一团，在平江嘉义乡集中整训后，由傅秋涛同志率领，开赴皖南抗日。参加座谈会的人看着会场墙壁上当年新四军留下的抗日标语，望着门前新修好的烈士墓，都想起了一九三九年六月十二日国民党匪帮在这里制造的“平江惨案”，想起了壮烈牺牲的涂正坤、罗梓铭等烈士。他们心里非常愤怒。青年农民江菊宗高擎着他父亲牺牲前留下的大劈刀说：“烈士们的鲜血没白流。我们的梭标、劈刀如今变成了飞机、大炮，我们的游击队变成了无敌于天下的人民解放军。我们有力量为烈士们报仇。”
    嘉义乡农民代表贺光说：“平江解放两年以来，我们翻身农民的光景一天比一天好。这都是老红军和解放军战士用血肉换来的。我们保证完成全乡六万多斤稻谷的增产捐献计划，购买飞机大炮，加强国防，保卫我们的幸福生活。为了迎接人民解放军建军二十四周年，我们还要切实做好代耕工作，坚决镇压一切潜伏的反革命分子，来报答毛主席、共产党和老红军的恩情。”（新华社）
