Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill deeply expands democratic reform
Strengthens internal unity of the working class
Prepares necessary conditions for further improving production

Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, in its democratic reform movement, eliminated feudal remnants and strengthened the internal unity of the working class, laying the foundation for the factory to further improve production. On the basis of the victorious mass suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the factory launched a democratic reform movement. On May 5th, it began a democratic struggle against feudal reactionary elements, abolished the universally hated "foreman" system, and carried out labor insurance card registration work on June 14th. Through this work, the working masses ideologically distinguished between ourselves and the enemy, and purified their ranks. At this time, the workers unanimously raised the demand to improve production, but there were still some difficulties in truly and deeply improving production. The corrupt system accumulated over many years by the old enterprise, especially the reactionary elements and feudal foremen and other dark forces, created regional factions, seriously hindering the unity of the workers, so production management was very chaotic, and the relationship between employees was very abnormal. If these situations are not improved, many difficulties will still be encountered in production in the future.

In the democratic struggle against feudalism, some problems within the working class were also examined. For example, the relationship between workers and administrative leaders, the relationship between workers and the trade union, the relationship between workers and staff, the relationship between workers and workers, as well as the workers' work attitude and the administrative management system, etc. In the struggle against feudal reactionary elements, in order to concentrate forces to strike at the enemy and avoid confusing the target of struggle and our own camp, these problems were not resolved. After the feudal reactionary elements were fought against, it was necessary to carry out democratic unity work within the working class in order to solve these problems.

The central slogan of democratic unity put forward by the factory leadership is: "All workers and staff throughout the factory promote the attitude of masters of their own affairs, do a good job in democratic unity; reform the old system, establish a new system; reform the old organization, establish a new organization; reform the old thinking, establish a new thinking."

When carrying out democratic unity, everyone discussed the reasons for past disunity and disagreements, and the result proved that many of them were caused by being deceived by feudal foremen in the past. For example, when Class A and Class B handed over shifts, everyone secretly stole each other's working hours. As a result, their own yarn increased, while others' yarn decreased. So the workers turned against each other, while the foremen laughed secretly. In the past, workers not only couldn't get enough to eat but were also subjected to anger everywhere, resulting in quarrels with their own brothers and sisters. The twenty-third group of the No.2 Fine Yarn Class of the North Plant, due to the feudal foreman spreading rumors that "everyone looks down on the twenty-third group," therefore, no matter which model group put forward a challenge, they "unanimously did not respond" and even maliciously attacked them. This time everyone figured it out. They said: Wuhan has been liberated, the factory has been liberated, but everyone's thinking has not been liberated, and their work attitude is almost the same as before liberation. This situation cannot be justified today. Special agents, bullies, feudal foremen, some were shot, some were locked up, some were under surveillance... there is no one in the factory to oppress the workers anymore; workers have their own trade unions, enjoy labor insurance benefits, and can learn culture. Since they are the masters of the country and the masters of the factory, why not actively produce? The entire twenty-third group passed a plan: "Learn from labor models!" They explained this transformation as "ideological liberation."

Like all old enterprises, the relationship between staff and workers in the First Cotton Mill was also antagonistic before liberation. A few staff members oppressed the workers, despised labor, and looked down on the workers. One female worker said: "At that time, workers didn't know whether they could enter the factory tomorrow after working today, and they didn't know if they would have the next meal after eating this meal, so how could they have the heart to produce? But when the staff saw the workers idling, they glared and cursed." After liberation, the staff could no longer use the old methods to manage production, but they didn't know new management methods, so many people complained and said: "The current workers are not obedient." Therefore, some staff members adopted an irresponsible attitude of "doing things carelessly and getting by."

In the democratic unity movement, the workers examined the production losses caused by the staff's irresponsibility. In the past, when workers encountered problems in production, they would look for the administrator to solve them, but the administrator would say that it was the responsibility of the workshop director. When the workers looked for the workshop director, the workshop director would say that it was the administrator's business. As a result, no one cared. This time, the workers' opinions to the staff were generally to ask the staff to "take care of things."

At first, the staff had concerns about carrying out criticism. They thought: Would they be criticized in front of the masses, would they "lose face," and would their "prestige be swept away"? The workers of the South Factory raised opinions to Xia Qinghai (Communist Party member), the director of the small workshop of the contracting department. Xia Qinghai sincerely made a self-criticism, and the workers applauded. As a result, Xia Qinghai's prestige was not only not "swept away," but even improved. After the meeting, the workers still looked for him to talk about work and discuss problems.

After listening humbly to the opinions of the masses, the staff member Hu Wenfan made his own review. The next day, when he entered the workshop, the situation was very different from usual, and the workers greeted him with smiles. He felt intimately that: to improve production, the relationship between staff and workers must be improved.

When discussing how to improve production, the focus was on the production management system. Everyone raised many criticisms of administrative management, the main ones being the bureaucratic work style of administrative leaders, only arranging without checking, tasks not being implemented, and lower-level situations being difficult to reach the higher levels.

On May 20th, the factory convened a factory-wide congress of trade union member representatives and re-elected the trade union committee. The workers were very cautious from the election of representatives. They said: "We can't be like in the past anymore. In the past, when electing representatives, a clap of hands and a raise of hands was enough. As a result, even special agents were elected as committee members, and everyone suffered." When a workshop was carrying out elections, a situation arose where the cadres nominated and asked the workers to vote for approval. Some people cast "blank votes" on the spot. Afterwards, the masses were dissatisfied and criticized: "Elections must be democratic, and cadres cannot force them!" This election proved that the working masses already understood that the trade union was their own.

After the factory launched the democratic unity movement, it strengthened the unity between workers and trade unions, and between staff and workers. This prepared the necessary conditions for the factory to further improve production. In fact, production work has improved during the factory's suppression of counter-revolutionaries and democratic reform movement. In the past, the factory had to reduce production by 10% during the plum rain season in April every year. This year, the workers' enthusiasm for labor was enhanced, and production not only did not decrease, but also increased by 1.5%. Now, the factory's accidents and waste have also been reduced. The Qinghua room of the North Plant, which used to have three or four accidents every month, has completely eliminated accidents in May and early June of this year. The waste rate of the yarn-reeling room of the North Plant has also been reduced by 60%.

　　武汉第一纱厂深入展开民主改革
    加强了工人阶级内部的团结
    为进一步搞好生产准备了必要条件
    武汉市第一纱厂在民主改革运动中清除了封建残余势力，加强了工人阶级内部的团结，为该厂进一步搞好生产打下了基础。该厂在群众性的镇压反革命的胜利基础上，展开了民主改革运动。于五月五日开始展开反对封建反动分子的民主斗争，取消了人人痛恨的“头佬”（把头）制度，在六月十四日进行了劳动保险卡片登记工作。通过这一工作，工人群众在思想上分清了敌我，纯洁了自己的队伍。这时，工人们一致提出了搞好生产的要求，但真正深入一步地提高生产，还存在着一些困难。旧企业所多年积留下来的腐败制度，特别是反革命分子和封建头佬等黑暗势力制造地域帮派，严重地阻碍了工人的团结，所以生产管理非常紊乱，职工关系很不正常。这些情形如不加以改善，则今后在生产上仍会遇到不少困难。
    在反对封建的民主斗争中，还曾检查到工人阶级内部的一些问题。比方工人与行政领导的关系，工人与工会的关系，工人与职员的关系，工人与工人的关系，以及工人的劳动态度和行政管理制度等。在斗争封建反动分子的时候，为了集中力量打击敌人，避免混乱斗争目标和自己的阵营，所以没有解决这些问题。当斗争了封建反动分子之后，就必须在工人阶级内部展开民主团结的工作，以便解决这些问题。
    该厂领导上提出民主团结的中心口号是：“全厂工人职员发扬主人翁态度，搞好民主团结；改革旧制度，建立新制度；改革旧组织，建立新组织；改革旧思想，建立新思想。”
    在进行民主团结时，大家讨论了过去不团结、闹意见的原因，结果证明许多都是过去被封建头佬欺骗而闹成的。如甲乙班交班时，大家互相偷占对方的工时，结果自己的纱多了，别人的纱少了，于是工人自己敌对起来，头佬却暗地里笑了。过去，工人不但吃不饱饭还到处受气，蹩了一肚子火，结果弄得和自己兄弟姊妹也吵嘴呕气。北厂细纱乙班二十三组，由于封建头佬造谣说“谁都瞧不起二十三组”，因之该组无论见到那个模范小组提出挑战，都“一致不响应”，且加以恶意打击。这一回大家想通了。他们说：武汉解放了，工厂解放了，然而大家的思想还没有解放，劳动态度还和解放以前差不多，这种情况，今天怎么也说不过去了。特务、恶霸、封建把头、有的枪毙了，有的关了起来，有的在管制……，厂里再没有人欺压工人了；工人有自己的工会，享受了劳动保险待遇，可以学文化。自己既是国家的主人，又是工厂的主人，为什么不积极生产呢？二十三组全体通过了一项计划：“向劳动模范学习！”她们把这个转变解释为“思想翻身”。
    像所有旧企业一样，第一纱厂的职员和工人关系，在解放前也是对立的，少数职员欺压过工人，轻视劳动，瞧不起工人。一位女工说：“那时工人今天做工不知明天能不能进厂，吃了上顿不知有无下顿，那里还有心生产，但是职员看到工人磨洋工，便鼓起眼睛骂。”解放以后，职员在管理生产上，再用旧的一套行不通了，可是新的管理方法又不会，于是不少人发牢骚说：“现在的工人不服管了。”所以有些职员采取了不负责任的“马虎了事，得过且过”的态度。
    在民主团结运动中，工人们检查了由于职员不负责任所造成生产上的损失。过去工人遇到生产中的问题，找管理员解决，管理员说归车间主任管。工人找车间主任时，车间主任却说这是管理员的事。结果是大家不管。这次工人对职员所提的意见，普遍是要求职员要“管事”。
    最初，职员们对开展批评是有顾虑的。他们想：会不会在群众面前被批评，会“刮了面子”，“威信扫地”？南厂工人对承包部小车间主任夏清海（共产党员）提了意见，夏清海诚恳地作了自我检讨，工人拍手欢迎。结果夏清海的威信不但没有“扫地”，倒更提高了。散了会工人还找他谈工作，商量问题。
    职员胡文范在虚心倾听了群众意见后，自己进行了检讨。第二天他一进车间，情形就和往常大不相同，工人见了他笑眯眯地打招呼了。他亲切地感受到了：想搞好生产，职员和工人关系是必须改善的。
    在讨论如何提高生产的问题时，焦点集中在生产管理制度上。大家对行政管理提出许多批评，其中主要的是行政领导的官僚主义作风，只布置不检查，任务不能贯彻，下情难以上达。
    五月二十日该厂召开了全厂工会会员代表大会，改选了工会委员会。工人从选举代表起就十分慎重，他们说：“再不能像过去一样了。过去选代表，巴掌一拍、手一举就算了。结果把特务都选举成什么委员，大家都吃了苦头。”有一个车间在进行选举时，发生了干部提名请工人投票通过的情形，有些人当场投了“白票”，事后群众纷纷不满，提出批评：“选举要民主，干部不能强迫呀！”这次选举，证明了工人群众已懂得工会是自己的了。
    该厂展开了民主团结运动以后，加强了工人和工会、职员和工人之间的团结。这样就给该厂进一步搞好生产准备了必要的条件。事实上，在该厂镇压反革命和民主改革运动中，生产工作已有进步。过去该厂在每年黄梅季节的四月份内都要降低产量百分之十，今年四月工人的劳动积极性提高了，产量不仅未降低，还提高了百分之一点五。现在该厂的事故和浪费的现象也减少了。过去每月都有三、四次事故的该厂北厂清花间，在今年五月和六月上旬都已完全消灭了事故。该厂北厂摇纱间的回丝率也降低了百分之六十。
