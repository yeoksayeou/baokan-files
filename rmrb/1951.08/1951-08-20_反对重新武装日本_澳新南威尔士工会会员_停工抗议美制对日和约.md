　　Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 19th. TASS, Sydney, 18th: All union members in many cities in New South Wales, following the instructions of the union council, have stopped work to commemorate those who sacrificed in the War of Resistance Against Japan and to protest the American draft of the Japanese peace treaty. All members of the Wharf Labourers' Federation stood in silence for ten minutes.
　　*The Tribune* writes: During the Patriotic Protest Movement week, the people of all Australia are increasingly concerned about the terms of the Japanese "peace" treaty manipulated by the United States. General Bennett, commander of the Australian army in Malaya during the war, expressed the deep feelings of Australia in Adelaide. He said at the Veterans' League Congress: "Rearming Japan is foolish." The New South Wales Veterans' League held a congress in Sydney this week, and the delegates put forward many motions against the rearmament of Japan.
　　Another major event this week was the start of the vote on "Do you agree with the rearmament of Japan?", with ballots issued by the Committee Against the Rearmament of Japan. The Miners' Federation began voting this week. Another proof of the growing mass movement in Australia against the rearmament of Japan is the intensification of the campaign to collect signatures on the "No Japanese Armament" petition.

　　反对重新武装日本  澳新南威尔士工会会员  停工抗议美制对日和约
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社悉尼十八日讯：新南威尔士许多城市的所有工会会员都按照工会理事会的指令停止工作，纪念那些在抗日战争中牺牲的人们，并抗议美国对日和约草案。码头工人联合会的全体会员都起立静默十分钟。
    《论坛报》写道：在爱国抗议运动周中，全澳大利亚的人民对美国所操纵的日本“和平”条约的条款日益关心。战时马来亚澳军司令贝奈特将军在阿德雷德说出了澳大利亚的深刻的感觉，他在退伍军人联盟代表大会上说：重新武装日本就是愚蠢。新南威尔士退伍军人联盟本周在悉尼举行代表大会，代表们提出了许多反对日本重新武装的议案。
    本周的另一件大事是开始举行“你是否赞成重新武装日本”的投票，票是由反对重新武装日本委员会发出的。矿工联合会本周开始投票。澳大利亚反对日本重新武装的群众运动日益增长的另一证明是：征集在“不准日本武装”请愿书上签名的运动加紧了。
