Strengthen the Struggle to Defend World Peace
    – A Record of the World Peace Council Executive Bureau Helsinki Meeting –

　　From July 20th to 23rd of this year, the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council held its second meeting (the first Executive Bureau meeting after the Council's full meeting was held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, in May of this year) in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, since the Berlin World Peace Council plenary session. After four days of intense work, multiple studies and discussions in the general meeting, committees..., the conference had great gains. The first item on the agenda was "The Response and Goals of the Peace Pact Movement," with a report given personally by the Chairman of the World Peace Council, Joliot-Curie. The meeting discussed the progress of the movement to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact in various countries around the world under the current international situation, stipulated the future work guidelines and steps, and made a general resolution - calling on men and women of all countries around the world to strengthen the struggle to defend peace. The second item on the agenda of the meeting was the issue of convening the next plenary session of the World Peace Council. The third item on the agenda was about various international conferences. Secondly, the organizational and political issues of the World Peace Council Secretariat's work were discussed.

    This meeting attracted the attention of democratic and progressive people around the world, because, as the general resolution of the meeting stated: "All men and women, the people of all countries are equally concerned about peace." All people and all countries and nations around the world are very concerned about the cause of peace, because this cause is now in a dangerous state and needs to be defended. The struggle for peace still needs to be strengthened.

    The broad masses of people around the world support lasting and long-term peace and oppose the threat of a new world war. This movement is constantly developing and strengthening. More and more people from all walks of life and with different political views and religious beliefs in all countries around the world are joining this struggle day by day, opposing the attempt by the US-British imperialist bloc to incite a third world war. All ordinary people and all peace-loving people are vigilantly watching the conspiracies of the warmongers. They all understand that "the international situation has become more complicated in recent months." That is to say, more tense.

    The British and American imperialist bloc is now openly and blatantly preparing for a new world war. The American aggressors in Korea are now, on the one hand, being forced by the public opinion of the world and the doomed failure of the war of aggression, and have to start negotiations for an armistice; but on the other hand, they continue to carry out barbaric bombing and slaughter of the peaceful Korean people. Warmongers are creating disturbances everywhere in Europe and other parts of Asia. The rearmament of Germany and Japan is being carried out more intensively. Regular armies are being organized and navies and air forces are being restored in West Germany and Japan. The so-called "declaration ending the state of war with Germany" issued by the US, British, and French groups deepened the division of Germany and accelerated the rearmament of Germany and the restoration of the German fascist army.

    As an integral part of the policy of aggression, the US government is preparing to make a separate peace with Japan. This is a measure taken by the US imperialists and Japanese revanchists to collude against peace and against the interests of all peoples, including the Japanese people. This is to make Japanese militarism the basic ally of the US aggressors in Asia and turn Japan into a US military base and colony.

    The arms race among the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty is now accelerating even more. Weapons of mass destruction are being manufactured at an accelerated pace. From Truman's recent semi-annual economic report, it can be seen that the US military budget will increase by another 50 percent in the past six months. US imperialists are establishing military bases all over the globe.

    All of this is clearly seen by the people of all countries. Therefore, they are raising their vigilance and working harder for the movement to defend peace. Therefore, the resolution of the Helsinki Conference stated: "This situation shows that if we do not want to fall into the abyss, there is still a great deal to be done."

    The specific action of the peace movement in various countries is still to continue to strive for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers. This movement has now been launched in fifty-eight countries around the world. The success of the movement proves that the declaration of the World Peace Council has won the hearts of the people. The signature movement to demand the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers is being carried out enthusiastically in various people's democratic countries, capitalist countries, and colonies and dependencies. Among these countries, our People's Republic of China undoubtedly has the largest number of signatures on this declaration - 343,808,541. This number makes peace-loving people extremely excited. The signature movement in Asian and Latin American countries has achieved results. Heroic Korea has more than seven million signatures. India recently convened the second All-India Peace Congress in Bombay, supporting an armistice in Korea, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and allowing the Korean people to solve their own problems. More than one million people in India have signed the petition demanding the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers. Indonesia has 350,000 people. Last year, 140,000 people in Thailand signed the Stockholm Declaration. Regardless of government oppression, the peace movement in Thailand is now developing day by day. The movement to defend peace in Burma is also very active. Approximately one million people have signed the declaration demanding the conclusion of peace pacts by the five great powers in Argentina, 500,000 in Brazil, and 500,000 in Cuba. The peace movements in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Iran, the Netherlands, and Denmark have made significant progress. Six million people in France have signed the World Peace Council Declaration, and eight million in Italy. (Editor's note: The number of signatures in the aforementioned countries were statistics during the Helsinki Conference)

    The peace movement is booming in countries all over the world. But this is not satisfactory. World Peace Council Chairman Joliot-Curie said at the Helsinki Conference that this important and serious movement must be carried through to the end. In order to achieve this great goal, all people who support peace are required to continue to work hard.

    Based on Professor Joliot-Curie's report and the speeches and discussions of the representatives of various countries attending the meeting, the Executive Bureau of the Helsinki Conference made a general resolution, calling on all good people in the world to work harder for the movement to defend peace. The Executive Bureau called on people to fight for the implementation of an armistice in Korea, believing that this is a victory for the will of the people of the world to adhere to peace, advocate negotiations, and oppose the use of force to resolve international disputes. But it also believes that "this is only the first stage in the struggle for peace." The main task of the people of all countries is still to continue to strive for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers. Because "at present, negotiations between the five major powers have become the only way to resolve existing differences." The resolution also pointed out that a peace pact "could not only eliminate the direct danger of the outbreak of war, but also could establish lasting peace."

    This general resolution points out that the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, first, can restore the United Nations to its original mission as an organization for international cooperation. Second, it can implement universal, gradual, simultaneous, and supervised disarmament. It not only prohibits the arms race, but also prohibits and strictly controls atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and greatly reduces the armies and armaments of major countries. Third, the conclusion of a peace pact can "establish and develop normal economic relations and cultural ties between different countries."

    The people of all countries and nations know that "if they want to avoid catastrophe, they must unite their will to defend peace, regardless of their differences, so that the cause of peace will be saved."

    This resolution proves once again the great significance of Stalin's interview with a reporter from Pravda in February of this year:

    "If the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated."

    The Helsinki Conference decided to convene a plenary session of the World Peace Council on October 10th of this year. At that plenary session, very important issues concerning the defense of world peace will be discussed. At that time, peace fighters from all over the world - all members of the World Peace Council - will gather together again to discuss the issue of greatest concern to all mankind - the issue of fighting for survival and opposing death.

    The Executive Bureau of the Helsinki Conference also decided on the issues of various international conferences, global and regional peace conferences, and international conferences in various sectors. One of the most important is the International Economic Conference.

    Since the World Peace Council decided to convene an International Economic Conference, people from all walks of life in countries around the world have warmly welcomed it. People from business and society in various countries have exchanged opinions many times to organize the international preparatory committee for this conference. This committee will collect and reflect the various opinions and interests of all people from all walks of life who are preparing to participate in the International Economic Conference, and will be responsible for distributing invitations and deciding on issues related to the agenda and conference work.

    The Executive Bureau has received many letters stating that people from various economic sectors, engineering and technical personnel, trade unions, and cooperatives in countries such as the United Kingdom, China, the United States, France, India, Italy, Poland, and Brazil will participate in the conference.

    In addition, the Executive Bureau is very satisfied with the suggestion of the representative of the Soviet Peace Committee to hold this International Economic Conference in Moscow. Famous Soviet economists, representatives of industry, trade, cooperatives, and trade unions have declared their willingness to participate in this international conference, preparing to work with representatives from various countries to study specific methods to overcome obstacles and difficulties in normal relations between countries and to improve people's living standards.

    The Executive Bureau agreed with the suggestions of people from all walks of life in various countries that this international conference should be held before the end of this year, and the specific date will be determined by the International Preparatory Committee.

    This decision can promote normal economic exchanges between countries and improve people's lives, so it will make a huge contribution to the cause of peace.

    The participation of the People's Republic of China in this conference has aroused great interest in various countries. In order to oppose the economic manipulation of US imperialism and the illegal decision of the United Nations to "embargo" China, I think that our country's business community, trade unions, cooperatives, engineering and technical personnel, and economists will strongly welcome this International Economic Conference.

    Promoting normal economic and cultural relations between countries is a major step towards the cause of peace.

    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have united, organized, and resolutely stood in the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. We will definitely continue to work hard to defend peace in the Far East and the world, to defend the independence of the motherland, and to build our own peaceful and happy life to the end!

　　加强保卫世界和平的斗争
    ——记世界和平理事会执行局赫尔辛基会议——
    本年七月二十日到二十三日，世界和平理事会执行局在芬兰首都赫尔辛基举行了自从柏林世界和平理事会全体会议以后的第二次会议（理事会全会后的第一次执行局会议是今年五月间在丹麦首都哥本哈根开会的）。这次会议经过四天紧张的工作，大会、委员会……多番的研究和讨论，有很大的收获。会议的第一个议题便是“和平公约运动的回响与目标”，由世界和平理事会主席约里奥——居里亲自作了报告。会议研讨了在现今的国际形势下，在世界各国开展的要求五大国缔结和平公约运动的进程，规定了今后工作的方针、步骤，作出了总的决议——向全世界各国男男女女号召加强保卫和平斗争。会议的第二个议程是关于召开下次世界和平理事会全体会议的问题。第三个议程为关于各种国际会议的问题。其次又讨论了世界和平理事会书记处的工作等等组织的政治的问题。
    这次会议引起了全世界民主进步人类的注意，因为正如会议的总决议所说：“所有的男人和女人，所有国家的人民都同样关心和平。”全世界一切人们，一切国家、民族都非常关心着和平事业，是因为这个事业现在处在危险的状态里，它需要保卫。为和平的斗争还需要加强。
    世界广大人民群众赞成持久的和长期的和平，反对新的世界大战的威胁，这个运动是在不断地发展着和加强着。全世界各国所有各阶层的人们，所有各种政治见解不同和宗教信仰不同的人们，一天比一天多地都加入了这个斗争，反对美英帝国主义集团煽起第三次世界大战的企图。一切普通的人们，一切爱好和平的人民都十分警惕地注视着战争贩子们的阴谋。他们都了解到，“最近几个月来国际形势变得更为复杂了。”就是说，更为紧张了。
    英美帝国主义集团现在是公开地、明目张胆地准备着新的世界大战。在朝鲜的美国侵略者，现在一面被世界人民公意所逼迫，和侵略战争的注定了的失败，不得不开始谈判停战；但一面仍继续向朝鲜和平人民进行野蛮的轰炸和屠杀。战争贩子在欧洲和亚洲其他地方到处寻衅。重新武装德国和日本更加紧地在进行着。在西德和日本正在组织正规军队，恢复海军和空军。美、英、法集团发表的所谓“结束对德战争状态”那个虚伪的宣言，更加深了德国的分裂，加速着德国的再武装和恢复德国的法西斯军队。
    作为侵略政策的组成部分的，是美国政府准备对日单独媾和。这是美帝国主义者和日本的报复主义者勾结起来，反对和平，反对一切人民包括日本人民在内的利益的措施。这是叫日本军国主义作美国侵略者在亚洲的基本同盟者，并且把日本变为美国的军事基地和殖民地。
    北大西洋公约各国的军备竞赛现在是更为加快了。大量杀人的武器在加紧制造着。从最近杜鲁门的半年经济报告中，可以看出在最近半年内美国的军事预算又将增加了百分之五十。美帝国主义者正在地球各处建立军事基地。
    所有这些都是世界各国人民所清楚看见的。因此他们提高自己的警惕，更加努力于保卫和平的运动。因此赫尔辛基会议的决议说：“这种形势表明：假如我们不愿陷入深渊，还有非常多的事情要做。”
    世界各国和平运动具体的行动，现在仍然是继续为要求五大国缔结和平公约而奋斗。全世界现在已在五十八个国家里开展了这个运动。运动的成功，证明世界和平理事会宣言是获得人心的。要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名运动已经在各人民民主国家、各资本主义国家以及各殖民地和附属国热烈地进行着。在这些国家里面，我们中华人民共和国在这个宣言上签名的无疑地是人数最多的——三四三、八○八、五四一人。这个数目字使得爱好和平的人们兴奋万分。在亚洲和拉丁美洲各国的签名运动都有成绩。英雄的朝鲜已有七百万人以上的签名。印度不久以前在孟买召开了第二届全印和平大会的会议，赞成朝鲜停战，从朝鲜撤退外国军队，让朝鲜人民自己解决自己的问题。印度人民在要求缔结五大国和平公约上的签名人有了一百万以上。印尼有三十五万人。泰国去年有十四万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名，不顾政府压迫，泰国的和平运动现在正日益发展。缅甸保卫和平的运动也大有声色。在要求缔结五大强和平公约的宣言上签了名的，阿根廷有了约一百万人，巴西——五十万人，古巴——五十万人。在英国、美国、坎拿大、伊朗、荷兰、丹麦……这些国家的和平运动都有显著的进步。法国人民在世界和平理事会宣言上签名的有了六百万人，意大利有八百万人。（编者按：上述各国签名人数，系赫尔辛基会议期间所统计）
    和平运动在世界各国是蒸蒸日上了。但是这还不能令人满意。世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里在赫尔辛基会议上说，这个重要而严肃的运动要进行到底，为了达到这个伟大的目标，要求一切拥护和平的人们继续地紧张地努力工作。
    根据约里奥—居里教授的报告和到会各国代表的发言与讨论，执行局赫尔辛基会议作出了总的决议，号召世界所有善良的人们更加努力于保卫和平的运动。执行局号召人们为实行在朝鲜停战而奋斗，认为这是世界人民坚持和平、主张谈判、反对武力解决国际争端这个意志的胜利。但同时也认为“这只是争取和平斗争的第一阶段”。各国人民主要的任务仍在于为缔结五大国和平公约而继续努力奋斗。因为“目前五大国举行谈判就成为解决现存分歧的唯一办法。”决议又指出，和平公约“不仅可能消灭战争爆发的直接危险，而且可能建立持久的和平。”
    这个总决议指出，五大国和平公约的缔结，第一，可以使联合国回复到原来的国际合作的组织的使命。第二，可以实行普遍的、逐步的、同时进行的并且有监督的裁军。不仅禁止军备竞赛，并且禁止和严格管制原子武器及其他大规模杀人的武器，和大量裁减各大国的军队和军备。第三，和平公约的缔结，可以“建立与发展不同国家间正常的经济关系与文化联系。”
    各国家各民族的人民都知道：“如果他们要免于浩劫，他们就要不问他们中间有何分歧，而把他们保卫和平的意志统一起来，这样，和平的事业就会得救。”
    这一决议一次又一次地证明斯大林今年二月间对真理报记者谈话的伟大意义：
    “如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”
    赫尔辛基会议决定了在本年十月十日召开世界和平理事会全会。在那个全会上将讨论关于保卫世界和平的非常重要的问题，那时全世界的和平斗士——世界和平理事会的全体理事们又将汇集于一堂，为全人类最关切的问题——争生存、反死亡的问题而谋虑。
    执行局赫尔辛基会议又决定了各种国际会议的问题，全球各区域的和平会议以及各部门的国际性会议。其中最重要的一个是国际经济会议。
    自从世界和平理事会决定召开国际经济会议以后，世界各国各界人士热烈欢迎。各国的实业界和社会人士多次地交换了意见，要组织这会议的国际筹备委员会。这个委员会将收集、反映所有准备参加国际经济会议的各界人们的各种意见和各方面的利益、负责分发请柬并决定有关议程与会议工作的问题。
    执行局得到许多信件，知道在英、中、美、法、印度、意大利、波兰、巴西，比利时等国将有经济各部门人士、工程技术界人员、工会及合作社等代表来参加会议。
    此外，执行局非常满意苏联拥护和平委员会代表建议在莫斯科召开这个国际经济会议、苏联著名的经济学家、工业、贸易、合作社和工会的代表已经宣称愿意参加这个国际会议，准备和各国代表们共同工作，研究具体方法，以克服各国之间的正常关系的障碍与困难，和提高人民的生活水平。
    执行局同意各国各界人士的建议，这个国际会议在今年年底以前召开，具体日期由国际筹备委员会决定。
    这一决定可以促进各国间正常的经济交流，改善人民生活，因此对和平事业将有巨大的贡献。
    中华人民共和国能参加这个会议，引起各国很大的兴趣。为了反对美国帝国主义在经济上的操纵，反对联合国对中国“禁运”的非法决定，我想我国的实业界、工会、合作社、工程技术界人士、经济学家们是会极力欢迎这个国际经济会议的。
    促进各国间经济的和文化的正常的关系是致力于和平事业的重大的步骤。
    中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，团结起来，组织起来，坚决地站在以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营里，一定再接再厉地为保卫远东及世界的和平，为保卫祖国的独立，建设自己和平、幸福的生活而奋斗到底！
