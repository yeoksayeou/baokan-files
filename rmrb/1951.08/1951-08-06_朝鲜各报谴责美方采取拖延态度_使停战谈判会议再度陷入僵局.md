    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 4th: The Korean newspapers published reports from the Korean Central News Agency on the developments of the Kaesong talks.

    The report stated that the U.S. side's position in discussing the second agenda item—namely, the demarcation of a military demarcation line and the establishment of a demilitarized zone—has once again brought the armistice negotiations to a standstill.

    The U.S. side has exhausted all methods to delay the negotiations, threatening and coercing the other party to accept their will, and they are attempting to use this means to pass their proposals. Although the issue of demarcating a military demarcation line along the 38th parallel is explicitly stipulated in the universally known Malik proposal, which is endorsed by all peace-loving countries, U.S. representative Joy refused to discuss this issue and demanded that the demarcation line be drawn far to the north of the 38th parallel. Therefore, the U.S. side is attempting to carve out a considerable area from northern Korea.

    This shameless demand of the U.S. side for Korean territory once again proves that the U.S. side does not want a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. The United States' efforts to seize foreign land once again prove that the American rulers are against the realization of peace in Korea. If the Kaesong talks break down due to the position held by the U.S. side, the U.S. side should be responsible for all the consequences.

    The "Democratic Korea" newspaper expressed the attitude of the Korean people towards the Kaesong talks in an editorial on August 3rd. The editorial was titled: "The withdrawal of both armies from the 38th parallel - this is the unwavering demand of the Korean people." The editorial said that the U.S. side's refusal to demarcate the military demarcation line along the 38th parallel once again proves that the U.S. ruling clique does not want peace in Korea. The Korean people believe that a ceasefire and the withdrawal of both armies from the 38th parallel are the first steps towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Any conspiracy by the United States to violate this principle will never succeed.

### 朝鲜各报谴责美方采取拖延态度  使停战谈判会议再度陷入僵局

　　朝鲜各报谴责美方采取拖延态度
    使停战谈判会议再度陷入僵局
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社平壤四日电：朝鲜各报刊载朝鲜中央通讯社对开城会谈发展情况的报道。
    报道说：由于美方在讨论第二项议程——即划定军事分界线和建立非军事区的问题上所采取的立场，已使停火谈判再一次陷入僵局。
    美方想尽各种方法来拖延谈判，威胁和强迫对方接受他们的意志，他们企图用这种手段来通过他们的建议。沿三八线划定军事分界线的问题，虽然是一切爱好和平的国家所赞同的、人人皆知的马立克建议中所明文规定的，但是美方代表乔埃却拒绝讨论这个问题，即要求在三八线以北很远的地方划定分界线。因此，美方是企图把一块相当大的地区从朝鲜北部分割出去。
    美方对朝鲜领土的这种无耻要求，又一次证明了美方不要和平解决朝鲜问题。美国努力要抢夺外国土地，再一次证明了美国统治者反对在朝鲜实现和平。如果开城谈判由于美方所持的立场而宣告破裂的话，美方应对一切后果负责。
    《民主朝鲜》报在八月三日的社论中表明朝鲜人民对开城谈判的态度。社论标题是：“——双方军队撤离三八线——这是朝鲜人民坚定不移的要求”。社论说：美方拒绝沿三八线划定军事分界线的原则，再一次证明了美国统治集团不要朝鲜获得和平。朝鲜人民认为停火和双方军队撤离三八线是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一个步骤。美国想要违背这个原则的任何阴谋，都决不能得逞。
