Xinhua News Agency, August 31st Dispatch from Jakarta: The Indonesian Communist Party issued a statement on July 27th, severely criticizing the US draft peace treaty with Japan. The statement said: The entire draft treaty violates various international treaties also signed by the United States, such as the Cairo, Potsdam, and Yalta agreements. This treaty was not drafted by the foreign ministers' conference of the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and the United Kingdom, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned agreements. According to the provisions of the draft treaty, China, which made the greatest contribution in the war to defeat Japanese fascism, is excluded from the peace treaty with Japan. The draft treaty also fails to guarantee the eradication of Japanese militarism and the restoration of democracy, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned agreements. It is very clear that if a separate peace treaty with Japan is signed without the participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, Indonesia will once again become a victim of Japanese militarism under the direction of American fascism.
　　
The statement opposes Indonesia's participation in the so-called "Peace Conference with Japan" unilaterally decided by the United States to be held in San Francisco.
　
Xinhua News Agency, August 31st Dispatch from The Hague, TASS: The movement to collect signatures for the Peace Pact Declaration is progressing smoothly in Indonesia. Over 431,000 people have already signed. In many cities and villages in Indonesia, all adults have signed the declaration demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. For example, 19,827 adults in Ambarawa City, Java, have signed the declaration; 22,171 people in Molifen City have signed.

　　印尼共产党发表声明
    抨击美国单独对日和约草案
    印尼四十三万以上人民已参加和平公约宣言签名
    【新华社三十一日讯】雅加达消息：印尼共产党在七月二十七日发表声明，严厉抨击美国的对日和约草案。声明说：整个和约草案都违犯了也有美国签字的各种国际条约，例如开罗、波茨坦与雅尔塔各项协定。这种和约不是根据上述各种协定的规定，由美、苏、中、英外长会议草成的。根据和约草案的规定，在打败日本法西斯主义的战争中作了最伟大贡献的中国被排除了在对日和约之外。和约草案也未根据上述各种协定的规定，保证肃清日本的军国主义与恢复民主。很显然，假若没有苏联与中华人民共和国的参加而签订了单独对日和约，印尼又要第二次成为在美国法西斯主义指使下的日本军国主义的牺牲者。
    声明反对印尼参加美国片面决定在旧金山召开的所谓“对日和会”。
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社海牙三十日电，雅加达消息：印尼为和平公约宣言征集签名的运动正在顺利进行中。参加签名的已有四十三万一千人。印尼有许多城市和乡村，全体成年人都在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签了名。例如，爪哇安马巴拉哇城的成年人一万九千八百二十七人都已在宣言上签名；茉莉芬城有二万二千一百七十一人签了名。
