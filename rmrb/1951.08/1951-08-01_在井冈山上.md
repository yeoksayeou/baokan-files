　　On Jinggang Mountain
　　After the failure of the Chinese revolution in 1927, Chairman Mao led the Autumn Harvest Uprising and formed a revolutionary armed force in the border area of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. After continuous hard battles, Chairman Mao led this troop to the Jinggang Mountain area and established the initial revolutionary base area.
　　Why go to the mountains? Because under the revolutionary situation at that time, Chairman Mao believed that it was not the time to attack, but the time to retreat. It was necessary to organize the retreat well, find a foothold, establish a base area, and preserve the revolutionary forces.
　　Why go to Jinggang Mountain? This is because Jinggang Mountain is located between the counties of Suichuan, Ninggang, Yongxin, and Lianhua in Jiangxi, and Chaling and Lingxian in Hunan, with a circumference of more than 500 li. It is surrounded by high mountains on all sides, making it very dangerous and easy for combat and defense. There is also a plain on the mountain, surrounded by nineteen markets, with five wells (wells meaning villages) in the middle: Upper, Middle, Lower, Big, and Small. The surrounding area is full of rice paddies and abundant produce. The peasants in the surrounding counties have been influenced by the revolution and are highly aware. It was because of the dangerous terrain, abundant produce, and good mass conditions that Chairman Mao chose Jinggang Mountain to establish a base area. …
　　The most significant event on Jinggang Mountain, and also an event of great significance in the creative period of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, was the meeting of Commander-in-Chief Zhu with Chairman Mao on Jinggang Mountain in April 1928. Commander-in-Chief Zhu brought three main regiments. After merging with Chairman Mao, the Fourth Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was established, consisting of three divisions and six regiments, with a total of more than 10,000 people. The commander was Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the party representative was Chairman Mao. From then on, these two merged armed forces, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, embarked on the correct path and developed. And the names of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu have been closely linked in the history of the Chinese revolution for a long time.
　　Life on Jinggang Mountain for the Red Army was very hard. There were many forests and clear streams on the mountain, so firewood and water were not a problem. The problem was grain, oil, and salt. Therefore, it was decided to prepare three months' worth of grain. At that time, the troops went down the mountain to carry grain in the morning and returned in the evening, going up and down the mountain every day, which was very interesting. The mountain was winding and overlapping, and every day people only saw people climbing up and down one after another, like snakes. At that time, Commander-in-Chief Zhu was already forty years old, and he personally cut a carrying pole in the woods, wrote "Zhu De Ji" (Zhu De's mark) on it, and personally carried it, sometimes two or three times a day. The Red Army soldiers were extremely excited to see that their commander was as hardworking as they were, and everyone worked even harder. At that time, there was a lot of gold in the army. When it snowed heavily, there was no other way but to use gold to buy cotton, but not everyone could have cotton clothes to wear. Some people still only wore single clothes, and if they didn't have cloth shoes, they wore straw sandals or went barefoot. The mountain was very high. The mountains in the southern provinces were often around 3,000 meters high, and there it was almost 4,000 meters high. There was often fog on the mountain, and supplies were very difficult. Initially, the counter-revolutionaries were far away, and the surrounding hundreds of miles were within the scope of the Red Army. Later, when the situation became serious, the Red Army was on the top of the mountain, and the enemy was at the foot of the mountain, and they could hear each other talking and singing. When the situation was tight, the Red Army ate pumpkins when they had no vegetables. In 1928, the Red Army was besieged several times, and everyone ate melons every day, meal after meal, living on melons. At that time, the troops did not have blankets, and they covered themselves with grass. Each person had a bundle of rice straw, covered it at night, and covered it with a door panel outside. When the door was opened, the whole room was full of grass, and people did not know anyone was there. When someone walked in, the sleeping person would shout because they were stepping on their head. But even in such difficult circumstances, because the officers and soldiers were fighting for the revolutionary cause and for the interests of the working people, they were politically equal, there was democracy within the army, the economy was completely open, everyone lived together, worked together, and fought against the enemy together, and they were very energetic.
　　The Red Army's fine tradition is inseparable from Chairman Mao's military building thought. Taking the task of doing mass work as an example, it was there from the beginning. Initially, there was a Workers' and Peasants' Movement Committee in the troops, which was the predecessor of the political department. In addition to the political education of the troops themselves, they also had to do mass work. In 1928, revolutionary regimes and local armed forces were established in six or seven counties near Jinggang Mountain. Land and grain were distributed, 600 catties per person. Farmers' associations, Young Pioneers, and Children's Corps were established, making a lively scene. The counter-revolutionary government officials in various counties fled to the big cities, and the power of the people was extremely great. In 1928, during the New Year, the masses had a song saying: "Happy New Year, Happy New Year, this year is not the same as in previous years, we want to capture Xiao Jia Bi alive, we want to eliminate Luo Puquan. Happy New Year, Happy New Year, you take the axe and I take the sickle, hold high the red flag and hold a grand meeting, fight the local tyrants and divide the land." (Note: Xiao Jiabi and Luo Puquan were both heads of the local militia whom the masses hated. Xiao Jiabi had already been captured alive by the PLA bandit suppression troops the year before and executed by firing squad after a public trial by the masses.) From these songs, one can imagine how close the relationship between the Red Army and the masses was at that time.
　　The Red Army relied on the people of Jinggang Mountain and the surrounding areas to defeat the enemy's several encirclements of the Jinggang Mountain base area. Soon after the Red Army arrived at Jinggang Mountain, the Eighth Army of the Kuomintang army in Hunan followed and chased into the mountains. The enemy had one army, while the Red Army had only one regiment at that time, actually only seven companies. Chairman Mao came up with a solution and put forward the slogan: "Concentrate on fighting, disperse to do mass work." On the one hand, he left two companies to guard Huangyangjie Ridge and fought hard with the enemy's main force for three days and nights, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The enemy never crossed Huangyangjie Ridge. On the other hand, he sent two companies to detour to the enemy's rear and cut off the enemy's transportation and supplies. The enemy was attacked from both the front and the rear and was forced to retreat. The Red Army preserved itself and drove away the enemy. This was the famous first counter-encirclement of Jinggang Mountain. This victory enabled the Red Army to temporarily gain a foothold in the Jinggang Mountain base area. Later, after Commander-in-Chief Zhu went up the mountain, the number of people increased and the military prestige greatly increased. In the summer of 1928, the Kuomintang armies of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces jointly launched an encirclement. The Red Army concentrated its forces and annihilated two of its regiments. The remaining enemies retreated in a panic, and another complete victory was won in the second counter-encirclement. Soon, Comrade Peng Dehuai led the troops who had revolted in Pingjiang, Hunan, to join them. The Kuomintang armies of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces launched a third encirclement. At that time, the leading organs decided to use Jinggang Mountain as a restraint, and the troops turned to the enemy's rear to expand the guerrilla warfare. Therefore, a strategic transfer was adopted. Comrade Peng Dehuai guarded the mountain, and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu launched the first Long March. That was on a day in December 1928 when it snowed heavily. There were 2,500 people, two main regiments, and one secondary regiment. The purpose was to pass through southern Jiangxi and go to eastern Jiangxi to establish a base area. When they arrived at Dayu, they were unexpectedly attacked by the enemy and suffered a defeat. However, because the troops had strong political work and strong leadership, they were able to unite and not disperse. At that time, they had to walk 140 li day and night, 30 days of forced march, getting up at 12 o'clock every night and walking until dark the next day before resting. They did this every day, and after getting up, they announced the order and left. But no one fell behind, and many wounded soldiers followed the troops. Because the enemy was chasing very closely, the Red Army launched a counterattack and completely defeated three regiments of the enemy, seizing more than 1,000 guns and capturing 2,000 people. The Red Army finally spread the seeds of revolution to the four provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi, and guerrilla groups were established everywhere. A single spark can start a prairie fire, and it can never be extinguished.
　　Chairman Mao established a base area in Jinggang Mountain, guiding the revolution to first develop in the countryside, take the road of armed struggle, and develop from one base area to establishing multiple and large base areas. This was a great turning point in the history of the Chinese revolution. Without the arduous struggle of Jinggang Mountain at that time, there would be no subsequent land revolution movement, and there would be no People's Liberation Army today; the history of the People's Liberation Army would start here as the first chapter. However, it was not easy to persist in this struggle at that time. At that time, there was a type of so-called "cancellationist" element who advocated not engaging in armed struggle and not making revolution. They retreated and fled automatically, and even ridiculed the Red Army, saying: "You Mao Zedong lives on the top of Jinggang Mountain, the special committee lives on the mountainside, and the district committee lives at the foot of the mountain. You are the first to know when the wind and rain come. What do you know about the world situation? What are you talking about revolution?" They could not see the future of the revolution. The Red Army had to oppose not only this kind of escapism, but also another kind of desperate sentiment that existed in the troops at that time, believing that the countryside was not very useful and that they should attack big cities. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Red Army opposed these two tendencies and successfully persisted in the struggle of Jinggang Mountain and launched the Second Domestic Revolutionary War.

　　在井冈山上
    一九二七年中国革命失败以后，毛主席便在湖南、江西边境一带地区，领导秋收起义，组成了革命武装。在连续的苦战以后，毛主席带领这支部队到了井冈山地区，建立了最初的革命根据地。
    为什么要上山呢？因为在当时革命形势之下，毛主席认为不是进攻的时候，而是退却的时候，应该很好地组织退却，找个立脚的地方，建立根据地，保存革命力量。
    为什么要上井冈山呢？这是因为井冈山在江西的遂川、宁冈、永新、莲花和湖南的茶陵、酃县等县之间，周围五百多里，四面都是高山，非常险要，便于作战防守。山上还有一片平地，周围有十九个集市，中间有上、中、下、大、小五个井（井就是村庄的意思），山周围都是稻田，出产丰富。周围各县的农民，受过革命的影响，觉悟程度很高。就是由于地形险要，出产丰富，群众条件好，所以毛主席选定井冈山建立根据地。……
    在井冈山上，最有意义的一件大事，也是中国人民解放军创造时期有极大意义的一件大事，就是朱总司令在一九二八年四月，上井冈山和毛主席会师。朱总司令带来了三个主力团，和毛主席会合后，成立了中国工农红军第四军，共编成三师六个团，人数有一万多。军长就是朱总司令，党代表就是毛主席。从此，这两支合而为一的武装部队，就在毛主席朱总司令的领导之下，走上正确的道路，发展起来。而毛主席和朱总司令的名字，在中国革命史上，便长期联系在一起。
    红军在井冈山上，是十分艰苦的。山上有很多的树林，有很清的涧水，所以柴水都不成问题，成问题的是粮食和油盐，于是决定要准备好三个月的粮。那时候队伍早上下山背粮，晚上回来，天天下山上山，情形很有趣。山是弯弯曲曲重重叠叠的，每天只看到一个个接连着爬上爬下，像蛇一样。当时朱总司令已经四十岁了，也亲自到树林里砍了一条扁担，上面写了“朱德记”三个字，亲自来挑，有时一天来回挑两三次。红军士兵看见自己的军长和他们一样的不辞辛苦，兴奋极了，大家干的更起劲了。当时部队里面金子比较多，到落大雪了没有办法，拿金子掉棉花，可是不能每人都有棉衣穿，有的还只穿单衣，没有布鞋要穿草鞋或者打赤脚。那个山很高，南方各省的山常常是在三千米达左右高，那儿就差不多有四千米达高，山上经常下雾，给养非常困难。最初反革命还隔的远，附近几百里路都是红军的范围，到以后一个时候形势严重起来了，红军在山头，敌人在山下，讲话唱歌都听到。形势紧的时候，红军没有菜吃就吃南瓜。一九二八年红军几次被围，大家就是天天吃瓜，顿顿吃瓜，以瓜度日，当时部队没有毯子，盖的是卧草，每人一捆禾草，晚上把禾草盖起来，外面遮一块门板，门打开满屋都是卧草，不知有人，一走进去，睡觉的就会叫起来，因为踏在头上了。可是就在这样艰苦困难的时候，由于官兵是为了革命事业奋斗，为劳动人民的利益而战，在政治上一律平等，军队内部讲民主，经济彻底公开，大家一块生活，一块劳动，一同对敌人作战，精神非常饱满。
    红军的优良传统，是和毛主席的建军思想分不开的。拿做群众工作这个任务来说，也是一开始就有了的。当初部队中有工农运动委员会，就是政治部的前身，除了部队本身的政治教育以外，还要做群众工作。一九二八年，井冈山附近的六七个县都建立了革命政权和地方武装，分过田，分过谷子，一个人六百斤，成立农民协会、少先队、儿童团，闹得热火朝天。各县的反革命政府官吏，都往大城镇逃跑，人民的力量大极了。一九二八年过新年，群众有一支歌子说：“过新年，过新年，今年不比往常年，要活捉萧家壁，要消灭罗普泉。过新年，过新年，你拿斧子我拿镰，高举红旗开大会，打了土豪分了田。”（按：萧家壁、罗普泉都是群众痛恨的民团团长，萧匪已经在前年被解放军剿匪部队活捉。经群众公审枪决。）从上面这些歌子，可以想见当时红军同群众的关系，是多么密切。
    红军就是依靠了井冈山和四围地区的人民，打垮了敌人几次对于井冈山根据地的围攻。红军刚到井冈山不久，湖南国民党军第八军便跟踪追进山来。敌人一个军，红军当时只有一个团，实际只有七个连。毛主席想了办法，提出：“集中打仗，分散作群众工作”的口号，一面自己留下两个连扼守黄洋界岭，同敌人主力苦战三昼夜，给敌人重大杀伤，敌人始终未能越过黄洋界岭；一面又派两个连迂回至敌人背后，截断敌人的运输给养。敌人背腹受敌，被迫退去，红军保存了自己，驱逐了敌人。这便是有名的井冈山第一次反围攻。这次胜利，使红军在井冈山根据地暂时站稳了脚根。后来朱总司令上山后，人数增多，军威大振。一九二八年夏季湖南、江西两省国民党军队联合来围攻，红军集中兵力，歼灭了它两个团，残敌狼狈退去，又取得了第二次反围攻的完全胜利。不久，彭德怀同志率领在湖南平江起义的部队，前来会合。湖南、江西、广东三省国民党军队又举行第三次围攻。当时领导机关决定以井冈山作为牵制，部队转入敌人后方，扩大游击战争，于是采取了战略上的转移，以彭德怀同志守山，毛主席和朱总司令举行第一次长征。那是在一九二八年十二月落大雪的一天出发的，有二千五百人，两个主力团、一个次要团，目的是要经过江西南部进到江西东部建立根据地。到了大庾，受到敌人意外袭击，遭受失败。但是，由于部队政治工作强，领导强，所以能够团结不散。当时一天一晚要走一百四十里路，三十天强行军，每天晚上十二点钟起床，一直走到第二天天黑才休息。每天照例如此，起床之后宣布命令就走。可是没有人掉队，许多伤兵都跟上了队伍。由于敌人追得很紧，红军来了一个反攻，把敌人三个团完全打垮，缴了一千多条枪，俘虏两千人。红军终于把革命种子散布到了福建、广东、湖南、江西四省，以后各地都搞起了游击队。星星之火，可以燎原，是再也扑不灭了。
    毛主席在井冈山建立根据地，引导革命首先在乡村发展，走武装斗争的道路，从一块根据地发展到建立多块和大块根据地，这是中国革命史上伟大的转折。如果没有当时井冈山的艰苦斗争，就没有以后的土地革命运动，就没有今天的人民解放军；人民解放军的历史，就从这里为开宗明义的第一章。可是，当时要坚持这一斗争，也是不容易的，当时有一类主张不要武装斗争，不要革命的所谓“取消派”分子，自动退却逃跑了，还讥笑红军说：“你们毛泽东住在井冈山顶，特委住在山腰，区委住在山脚，刮风下雨首先知道，晓得什么世界形势，谈什么革命。”他们看不见革命的前途。红军不仅要反对这种逃跑主义，同时也要反对当时部队中存在着的另一种拚命主义情绪，认为乡村没多大用处，要攻大城市。红军在毛主席领导下，反对了这两种倾向，才成功地坚持了井冈山的斗争，展开了第二次国内革命战争。（据总政新闻处稿，略有修改。）
