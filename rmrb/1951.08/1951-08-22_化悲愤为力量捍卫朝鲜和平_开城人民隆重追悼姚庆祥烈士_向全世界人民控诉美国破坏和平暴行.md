Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 21st: The people of all circles in Kaesong City held a solemn memorial meeting on the morning of the 20th to mourn Yao Qingxiang, the platoon leader who gloriously sacrificed his life while performing the military police duties in the Kaesong Neutral Zone. Representatives from all circles of the people of Kaesong City and the military police force of the Kaesong Neutral Zone attended the memorial meeting. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation, headed by General Nam Il, and foreign journalists who came to Kaesong to cover the armistice negotiations also attended the memorial meeting. The venue was filled with wreaths from various institutions and organizations and the citizens of Kaesong City, as well as elegiac couplets written in Chinese and Korean.
    The memorial meeting was held in a solemn and sorrowful atmosphere. Kim Jeon-hoe, the representative of the Kaesong City Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, served as the chairman of the meeting. He said: "Martyr Yao Qingxiang was murdered by the US and Syngman Rhee bandit troops while guarding the Kaesong Neutral Zone and protecting the safety of the armistice negotiation conference. We must accuse the US imperialism of sabotaging peace to the people of the world!" Then, Yuan Fusheng, the head of the Kaesong military police force, reported on Martyr Yao Qingxiang's contributions to the cause of defending peace during his lifetime and the details of his martyrdom while implementing the Kaesong Neutral Zone agreement. All participants were deeply moved by the glorious martyrdom of Martyr Yao.
    Gao Mingyuan, the deputy squad leader whose left foot was shot in the US and Syngman Rhee bandit troops' attack on August 19th, said indignantly at the meeting: "We have always faithfully abided by the agreement while performing military police duties in the Kaesong Neutral Zone. When the enemy shot at us, we didn't shoot back. When the enemy came, we retreated a little. We did this for the peace of Korea and the peace of the world; however, our patience is limited. If the enemy stubbornly persists and wants to break the peace talks, we are prepared to more resolutely fight back against the enemy. We resolutely demand that the enemy admit its mistakes, apologize, and guarantee that the same incident will not happen again in the future."
    General Deng Hua, the representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Armistice Negotiation Delegation, and General Lee Sang-cho, the representative of the Korean People's Army Armistice Negotiation Delegation, spoke at the meeting successively. (Full text of the speech will be issued separately)
    Park Bong-chun, the representative of the people of Kaesong City, swore indignantly in front of the portrait of Martyr Yao: "We will never let your blood be shed in vain. Our people in the city must unite more closely around the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, support the heroic Korean and Chinese soldiers, and strive for the lasting peace of the motherland!" Kim Joon-gap, the representative of the Korean People's Army, said: "Platoon Leader Yao! Rest in peace! We thousands upon thousands of Korean and Chinese soldiers who defend peace will follow your footsteps and continue to struggle for the cause of peace. We must complete the cause you have not completed!" Qiao Wanfeng, the deputy company commander of the company where Martyr Yao Qingxiang served, said: "The enemy's repeated provocative actions in the Kaesong Neutral Zone make all the soldiers in our company clearly realize that the enemy will not automatically abandon its policy of aggression. If US imperialism continues to act recklessly and breaks the peace talks, they should bear all the responsibility."
    The memorial meeting ended at about 2:00 pm. After the meeting, representatives from all walks of life in Kaesong City went to Zinan Mountain in Kaesong urban area to bury Martyr Yao Qingxiang.

　　化悲愤为力量捍卫朝鲜和平
    开城人民隆重追悼姚庆祥烈士
    向全世界人民控诉美国破坏和平暴行
    【新华社开城二十一日电】开城市各界人民于二十日上午举行隆重追悼会，追悼为执行开城中立区军事警察任务光荣殉职的姚庆祥排长。参加追悼会的有开城市各界人民代表和开城中立区的军事警察部队。以南日将军为首的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军朝鲜停战谈判代表团和来开城采访停战谈判的各国记者，也参加了追悼会。会场周围布满了各机关团体和开城市民送来的花圈和以中、朝两国文字书写的挽联。
    追悼会在肃穆、悲愤的气氛中进行。朝鲜劳动党开城市委员会代表金典会担任大会主席，他说：“姚庆祥烈士是为警戒开城中立区和为了保护停战谈判会议的安全而被美、李匪军杀害的。我们要向全世界人民控诉美帝国主义破坏和平的暴行！”接着，由开城军事警察部队负责人袁福生报告姚庆祥烈士生前对保卫和平事业的贡献以及他为了执行开城中立区协议而殉难的经过。全体与会者都为姚烈士光荣殉难的事迹所深深地感动。
    在美、李匪军八月十九日袭击事件中左脚被枪伤的副班长高明远在会上激愤地说：“我们在开城中立区担任军事警察任务，一贯忠实地遵守协定。敌人向我们打枪，我们不回枪。敌人来了，我们就退后一些。我们这样做是为了朝鲜的和平和世界的和平；但是，我们的忍耐是有限度的，如果敌人顽固到底，要使和谈破裂，我们就准备更坚决地迎击敌人。我们坚决要求敌人认错赔礼，保证今后再不发生同样事件。”
    中国人民志愿军停战谈判代表邓华将军和朝鲜人民军停战谈判代表李相朝将军，相继在会上讲话。（讲话全文另发）
    开城市人民代表朴逢春在姚烈士遗像前激愤地宣誓说：“我们决不会使你的血白流。我们全市人民一定要更加紧密地团结在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的周围，支援英勇的朝、中战士，为争取祖国的持久和平而奋斗！”朝鲜人民军代表金俊甲说：“姚排长！你安息吧！我们千千万万捍卫和平的朝、中战士，将踏着你的血迹，继续为和平事业奋斗前进。我们一定要完成你未竟的事业！”姚庆祥烈士生前所在连队副连长乔万风说：“敌人一再向开城中立区进行挑衅的行为，使我们全连战士都清楚地认识到：敌人是不会自动放弃它的侵略政策的。如果美帝国主义继续横行，使和谈破裂，他们应该负全部责任。”
    追悼会于下午二时许结束。会后，开城市各界人民代表并赴开城市区子男山，安葬姚庆祥烈士。
