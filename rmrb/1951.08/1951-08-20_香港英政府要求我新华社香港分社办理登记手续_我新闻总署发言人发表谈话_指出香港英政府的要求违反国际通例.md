(Xinhua News Agency, August 19th) The Hong Kong British Government's Registrar of Newspapers of the Chinese Civil Affairs Department, Mr. Dodd, sent a letter to the Hong Kong branch of this agency on August 2nd, requesting it to complete registration procedures. A reporter interviewed a spokesperson from the Central People's Government's News Administration on this matter, who provided the following statement:

It is reported that Dodd, the Registrar of Newspapers of the Chinese Civil Affairs Department of the British Hong Kong Government, sent a letter on August 2nd to the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency, the national news agency of the People's Republic of China, requesting the branch to complete registration procedures. Xinhua News Agency is the national news agency of the People's Republic of China, and the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency is a part of our national news agency. According to international practice, it is not subject to the laws and regulations of the local government and therefore does not need to register. This Administration has instructed the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency to notify the Chinese Civil Affairs Department of the British Hong Kong Government of this point.
