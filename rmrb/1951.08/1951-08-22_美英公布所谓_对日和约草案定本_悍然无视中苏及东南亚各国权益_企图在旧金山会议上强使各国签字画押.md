　　Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: The US and UK governments announced on the 15th the so-called "definitive draft of the peace treaty with Japan." This definitive version is the one that the US-UK bloc is attempting to force countries to sign at the San Francisco conference starting on September 4th—a unilateral and illegal peace treaty with Japan.

　　This so-called "definitive draft," released for the third time, is essentially the same as the "draft peace treaty with Japan" released on July 12th, and even the "initial draft" of the same in early April, with no changes. This "definitive draft" disregards the opinions of the Chinese and Soviet governments in their repeated statements on concluding a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan. It also disregards the opinions of the governments of India, Indonesia, Burma, and other Southeast Asian countries on the US-UK "draft peace treaty with Japan." It persists in violating relevant international agreements, excluding China's inalienable rights regarding the peace treaty with Japan, infringing upon the rights and interests of China, the Soviet Union, and other countries that fought against Japan, and seeking to make Japan a tool of American aggression and a colony in the Far East. When the "revised draft" was published in July, Dulles, the main drafter of the draft, stated that the United States hoped that "the newly independent countries of Asia will be willing to participate in such a treaty as we have drafted." One of the main intentions of the United States in publishing and distributing this draft is to try to induce countries such as India, Indonesia, and Burma to accept the US-made draft.

　　After receiving the draft, the governments of India and other countries successively put forward their opinions. According to a Reuters dispatch from New Delhi on August 10th, "India's suggestion is that Taiwan should be returned to China in accordance with the Cairo Declaration, because the future of the island affects the stability of the Far East situation; the specific provisions for bilateral or multilateral negotiations for the purpose of stationing foreign troops should be abandoned because it impairs Japanese sovereignty; the proposal for the trusteeship of Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands should also be abandoned for the same reason." The Indonesian government formally sent a note to the United States on August 6th, putting forward the Indonesian government's opinions. The main opinions are: restoring the clause recognizing Japanese sovereignty; "hoping to obtain fair and just compensation"; "giving the countries attending the San Francisco conference an opportunity to discuss the final text and exchange views on this text"; "if the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union are willing to participate in the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, the Indonesian government believes that such a desire should be supported." On the Burmese side, according to the Associated Press, the Burmese government notified the US government in writing on July 23rd that "any treaty without provisions for reparations will not be agreed to by Burma." The Philippines has also repeatedly advocated that Japan should pay compensation.

　　Although these countries' governments have put forward their opinions, most of them have been brazenly rejected by the United States. The US government has only made some verbal modifications in the "definitive draft" in an attempt to muddle through. A Reuters dispatch from London on the 15th frankly admitted: "The definitive draft" "essentially retains the main direction of the draft drawn up by US representative Dulles and British Foreign Secretary Morrison earlier this summer." An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 15th also admitted that the "definitive draft" shows that "the UK and US have made few concessions to Asia's criticism of the draft treaty, except for agreeing to Indonesia's request for a clearer provision of Japanese sovereignty."

　　In fact, although the "definitive draft" restored the clause on recognizing Japanese sovereignty in order to perfunctorily meet the requirements of Indonesia and other countries, this clause is only an irony of Japanese sovereignty because the entire "definitive draft" thoroughly undermines Japanese sovereignty.

　　The "definitive draft" made some verbal "embellishments" in terms of compensation clauses, but basically still obliterates the rights of those countries that have suffered great losses due to Japanese aggression to demand reasonable compensation from Japan. The Associated Press admitted: "The new draft attempts to slightly satisfy the compensation demands of Burma, the Philippines, and Indonesia, so it stipulates Japan's moral responsibility in somewhat stricter terms, but in reality, the method has not changed." The wording of the so-called "methods of paying compensation" "has minor changes in each section, but the content has not changed."

　　Apart from the above sections, the "definitive draft of the peace treaty with Japan" has not only no changes in content compared with the "revised draft," but even very few changes in wording.

### 美英公布所谓“对日和约草案定本”  悍然无视中苏及东南亚各国权益  企图在旧金山会议上强使各国签字画押

　　美英公布所谓“对日和约草案定本”
    悍然无视中苏及东南亚各国权益
    企图在旧金山会议上强使各国签字画押
    【新华社二十一日讯】美英两国政府在十五日公布了所谓“对日和约草案定本”。这个定本就是美英集团企图在九月四日开始的旧金山会议中，强使各国在上面签字画押的片面的、非法的对日和约。
    这个第三次公布的所谓“对日和约草案定本”，与七月十二日公布的“对日和约草案”，以至四月初公布的该草案“初稿”，本质上完全一样，并无改变。这一“草案定本”无视中国与苏联两国政府历次声明中关于缔结全面的公正的对日和约的意见，也无视印度、印尼、缅甸等东南亚各国政府对美英“对日和约草案”所提出的意见，仍然坚持破坏各项有关国际协议，排除中国关于对日和约的不容抹煞权利，侵犯中、苏及其他对日作战国家的权益，并要使日本成为美国在远东的侵略工具与殖民地。在七月间“修正草案”公布时，草案的主要起草人杜勒斯即表示：美国希望“亚洲的新独立国将愿意参与我们所拟定的这样的和约”。美国公布与散发该草案的主要用意之一，就是企图诱迫印度、印尼、缅甸等国接受美制草案。
    印度等国政府，在接到该草案后，先后提出了它们的意见。据路透社新德里八月十日讯，“印度的建议是：台湾应根据开罗宣言归还中国，因为该岛的前途影响到远东形势的稳定；关于为了驻扎外国军队而进行双方或多边谈判的具体规定应予放弃，因为它损害日本主权；关于托管琉球与小笠原群岛的建议也应以同样理由予以放弃”。印尼政府在八月六日正式照会美国，提出印尼政府的意见。主要的意见是：恢复承认日本主权的条款；“希望取得公平而正当的赔偿”；“使出席旧金山会议的国家有机会讨论最后条文，并就这项条文交换意见”；“如果中华人民共和国和苏联愿意参加缔结对日和约，印尼政府认为：应该支持这样的愿望”。缅甸方面，据美联社透露，缅甸政府在七月二十三日书面通知美国政府说：“任何没有偿付赔款规定的和约，都不能得到缅甸的同意”。菲律宾也再三主张日本应该支付赔偿。
    虽然这些国家政府都提出了它们的意见，但是，其中大部分都为美国悍然拒绝。美国政府在“草案定本”中只作了一些词句上的修改，以图敷衍了事。路透社伦敦十五日电坦率地承认：“草案定本”“对美国代表杜勒斯和英国外交大臣莫里逊今年初夏所拟定的草案的主要方针本质上保留未变”。合众社华盛顿十五日电也承认：“草案定本”表明，“英美除了同意印尼提出的更明白地规定日本主权的要求外，对于亚洲对和约草案的批评很少让步”。
    事实上，虽然“草案定本”为了敷衍印尼等国的要求，恢复了关于承认日本主权的条款。但是，由于整个“草案定本”彻底地破坏了日本的主权，所以这一条款只不过是对日本主权的讽刺。
    “草案定本”在赔偿条款方面作了一些辞句上的“润色”，基本上依然抹煞那些曾因日本侵略而遭受很大损失的国家要求日本合理赔偿的权利。合众社承认：“新草案企图稍稍满足缅甸、菲律宾和印尼的赔偿要求，因此它以多少比较严格些的措词来规定日本的道义责任，但实际上办法并未改变。”有关所谓“支付赔偿方法”的“各节的措辞有次要的改变，但内容并无改变”。
    除了上述各节以外，“对日和约草案定本”和“修正草案”比较起来，不仅内容无何变动，甚至在文字都很少变动。
