　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Reports:
　　The U.S. is Playing Tricks to Achieve Aggressive Aims

　　[Our Newspaper Dispatch] A Xinhua News Agency special correspondent reports: Because the U.S. side's representatives still insist on their absurd demand to demarcate the military demarcation line within our positions, the Korean armistice talks are still making no progress.
　　What are the reasons for the U.S. side deliberately creating a stalemate in the negotiation process? At least one of the reasons is that the U.S. representatives are not pursuing peace, but the "face" of American "victory". The U.S. authorities are worried that once they accept our fair and reasonable proposals for ending the war and peacefully resolving the Korean issue, the U.S. will lose prestige among its puppet countries. Take the issue of using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line as an example. Before Malik proposed armistice negotiations, American military and political leaders such as Marshall, Bradley, and Acheson had successively stated that an armistice could be achieved at the 38th parallel, and they believed that this was an American "victory". Acheson even believed that an armistice at the 38th parallel would be a "victorious end" to the Korean War after Malik's proposal. However, when our chief representative General Nam Il formally proposed using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line at the first meeting of the Kaesong negotiations, the U.S. side argued unreasonably that it could not be accepted, and that acceptance would be equivalent to an American "failure". Here, in addition to attempting to expand its aggression through negotiations, the U.S. authorities are also attempting to use negotiations to expand the influence of their "victory" in the aggressive camp, that is, pursuing "face". A U.S. Department of Defense spokesman said on July 31 that the U.S. refused to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line based on two important factors, one of which was that the U.S. military "retreating to the 38th parallel would be described by the Communists as a failure of the United Nations." The Washington Star, which is close to the State Department, stated even more clearly in its August 2nd editorial. The newspaper advocated that the U.S. should not "give an inch" on the issue of the military demarcation line, one of the reasons being that "the Communists will gain a propaganda victory from the armistice at the 38th parallel, which will enable them to describe the United States as a paper tiger." Recently, after we exposed the U.S. attempt to establish a military demarcation line north of the 38th parallel deep within our positions, it is reported that the U.S. representatives vaguely said at the meeting something about being "willing to discuss possible adjustments to the UN's proposed demilitarized zone." However, according to an Associated Press reporter on the 11th from Washington, U.S. officials believe that this adjustment is "an adjustment within the scope of possibly saving face." The result of the U.S. insisting on this paradoxical position is that it refuses to stop the Korean War under fair and reasonable conditions. An Associated Press reporter in Tokyo explained the attitude of the U.S. authorities on the 7th by saying: "They want to take full advantage of their advantages, but they are unwilling to suffer defeat on the propaganda front. They are unwilling to end the war if the ceasefire is in favor of the Communist side."
　　All indications show that the U.S. side is not sincerely treating the Kaesong armistice negotiations, but is playing various political tricks to achieve their ulterior motives of aggression. An International News Service correspondent in Tokyo revealed the opinion of Tokyo "Allied diplomats" on the 6th that the U.S. feels that "it can launch a diplomatic offensive against the Communists." It is very clear that the U.S. representatives' methods will not win "face" for the U.S., but will only completely expose their aggressive nature to the people of the world.

### 新华社记者报道  美方玩弄把戏图达到侵略目的

    美方玩弄把戏图达到侵略目的
    【本报讯】新华社特派记者报道：由于美方代表依然坚持其在我方阵地内划定军事分界线的荒谬要求，朝鲜停战谈判会议仍无进展。
    美方在谈判过程中故意制造僵局的原因是什么呢？至少原因之一是：美国代表所追求的不是和平，而是美国的“胜利”的面子。美国当局顾虑一旦接受我方关于结束战争及和平解决朝鲜问题的公正合理的建议，就会使美国在其仆从国家中丧失威信。拿以三八线作为军事分界线这一问题来说，美国的军政首脑马歇尔、布莱德雷、艾奇逊等在马立克倡议谈判停战之前，都曾先后表示可以在三八线实现停战，并且认为这是美国的“胜利”。艾奇逊甚至在马立克倡议后仍然认为在三八线停战就是朝鲜战争的“胜利结束”。但是，当我方首席代表南日将军在开城谈判的第一次会议上正式提出以三八线为军事分界线后，美方就强词夺理地认为不可以接受了，就认为接受了就等于美国的“失败”了。在这里，美国当局除了企图利用谈判扩大侵略外，还企图利用谈判扩大自己在侵略阵营中的“胜利”的影响，也就是追逐着“面子”。美国国防部发言人七月三十一日发表谈话说，美国拒绝以三八线为军事分界线是根据两个重要因素，其一就是美军“撤退到三八线将被共产党说成是联合国的失败”。接近国务院的华盛顿明星报在八月二日的社论中说得更明白。该报主张在军事分界线问题上美国应“寸步不让”，理由之一是“共产党将从三八线的停战中获得宣传胜利，这个停战将使他们能够把美国说成是一个纸老虎”。最近，当我方揭露了美方企图在三八线以北深入我方阵地内建立军事分界线后，据悉美方代表便在会议上含糊其词地说什么“愿意讨论对联合国拟议中的非军事区作可能的调整”。但是，据美联社记者十一日自华盛顿报道，美国官员们认为这种调整是“在可能挽回面子的范围内调整”。美国坚持这种悖谬立场的结果，就是拒绝在公正合理的条件下停止朝鲜战争。美联社驻东京记者七日解释美国当局的态度时说：“他们想要充分利用他们的优势，同时又不愿在宣传战线上遭到失败。他们不愿结束战争，如果停火对共产党方面有利的话。”
    种种迹象表明，美方并不是真心诚意地对待开城停战谈判，而是玩弄各种政治把戏，以达到他们不可告人的侵略目的。美国的国际新闻社驻东京记者六日透露的东京“盟国外交家”的意见认为：美国觉得“很可以向共产党展开外交攻势”。很显然，美国代表的手段，决不能为美国赢得“面子”，而只能把自己的侵略成性的面目彻底地暴露在世界人民之前。
