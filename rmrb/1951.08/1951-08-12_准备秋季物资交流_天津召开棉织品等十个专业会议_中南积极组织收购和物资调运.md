　　Preparing for Autumn Material Exchange
    Tianjin Holds Ten Specialized Conferences on Cotton Fabrics, etc.
    Central South Actively Organizes Procurement and Material Transfer
    The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Financial and Economic Committee's Urban and Rural Material Exchange Guidance Committee, in the three months from the end of April to the end of July, successively convened ten specialized conferences on cotton fabrics, agricultural tools, etc., making necessary preparations for the large-scale material exchange this autumn after the bumper agricultural harvest.
    Representatives from the industrial and commercial administrative departments of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, relevant private industrial and commercial sectors, state-owned trading companies, and the North China Cooperative Freight Station participated in the various specialized production and sales conferences. Relevant departments and industrial and commercial organizations of other local governments were also invited to send representatives to attend. At each specialized conference, the production, transportation, and sales parties jointly studied the production and sales of relevant commodities. Each industry formulated business plans for the next year or half-year based on its own operating capacity and the increased social purchasing power this year. Public-private, industrial-commercial, and Tianjin-external business relationships were established, and large-scale purchase and sale contracts and agreements were signed. For example, the contracts and agreements signed at the cotton fabric specialized conference were worth over 200 billion yuan, enough for the industry to produce for two to two and a half months. At the general merchandise specialized conference, the purchase and sale agreement figures for enamel basins and spittoons signed between the lead industry and the state-owned Tianjin Department Store also corresponded to the industry's output for one and a half to two months.
    The specialized conferences found that the main obstacles to the development of general private small factories and handicrafts were scattered organization, backward production equipment and technology, and conservative management methods. Therefore, the specialized conferences decided to require scattered small factories, workshops, and handicraftsmen to organize, strengthen joint operations, and establish joint factories. After the specialized conferences, industries such as knitting and cotton weaving have begun to organize the "Tianjin Dyeing Company," specializing in the processing and packaging of towels, socks, etc., to standardize the specifications and quality of products from various small factories. The machinery industry has also begun to establish "demonstration factories" to master advanced production equipment and technology, manufacture more standard tools, and lead the industry to improve production. The eighteen manual knitting factories in the 11th District have organized a cooperative factory and have accepted a commission from the state-owned department store to process 2,000 dozen socks. One hundred and three hemp rope households have organized a joint venture cooperative and are establishing a hemp factory. In addition, some factories in each industry have linked production processes, and some industries have established joint production and sales organizations among factories and merchants in the same industry.
    At the various specialized conferences, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government provided specific guidance on the production and operation of private industry and commerce. State-owned trading companies grasped the production and sales of commodities and carried out a large number of commissioned processing orders, which enabled some industries with light production and sales in the summer to maintain production.

    After the new rice and local products in the Central South region are harvested one after another, the huge purchasing power of the peasants will begin to flood into the market from August. State-owned trading companies in the Central South region are now actively preparing to supply the peasants with large quantities of materials. According to the decision of the Conference of Directors of Industry and Commerce Bureaus of the People's Governments of the provinces and cities in the Central South Region, convened by the Trade Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee not long ago, the focus of trade work in the region in the second half of the year is to purchase grain and local products and supply industrial products and daily necessities. The sales volume of cotton yarn by state-owned trading companies in the Central South region in the second half of this year will increase by 86 percent compared with the actual sales volume in the second half of last year, cloth by 115 percent, general merchandise by 361 percent, and edible oil by 256 percent. State-owned grain companies in various parts of the Central South region are now busily repairing and building grain storage warehouses, and are trying to increase the number of grain quality inspection staff and add moisture-proof tools and packaging materials. State-owned grain companies in Henan, Guangdong, and other provinces have begun to purchase large quantities of wheat and early rice. The cotton yarn and cloth transferred from outside the region to the textile factories in the region by the state-owned cotton yarn and fabric companies in the Central South region are being concentrated along transportation lines and major sales areas. In order to ensure military and civilian needs, supply the needs of urban reproduction industry production, and prevent commercial speculation, the People's Governments of Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and other cities in Henan Province have strengthened the management of the cotton yarn market. The state-owned department stores in the Central South region plan to purchase industrial products and handicrafts in the region (excluding those transferred from outside the region) through commissioned processing and ordering methods in the second half of this year, which will increase sixfold compared with the second half of last year.
    In order to complete the huge procurement and supply tasks after this autumn, state-owned trading companies in the Central South region have decided to establish more trade organizations in various counties; in counties without state-owned trading company organizations, they will widely dispatch mobile procurement teams and sales teams to penetrate into the primary markets.
    Editor's note: In the Central South region, due to the completion of land reform in more than half of the region's population, more than 90 percent of local and special products are sold, and the wheat and early rice harvests are abundant, the purchasing power of the peasants has greatly increased. In Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, where land reform was completed a year and a half ago, 40 percent of the former poor peasants have risen to the status of middle peasants.

　　准备秋季物资交流
    天津召开棉织品等十个专业会议
    中南积极组织收购和物资调运
    天津市人民政府财政经济委员会城乡物资交流指导委员会，从四月底到七月底三个月内，先后召开了棉织品、农具等十个专业会议，为农产丰收后的今秋物资大交流作了必要准备。
    参加各个专业产销会议的有天津市人民政府的工商行政部门，各有关私营工、商行业、国营贸易公司、华北合作货栈的代表；外地人民政府有关部门和工商团体，也应邀派代表列席。各个专业会议上，产、运、销三方共同研究了有关商品的产销情况。各行业都根据本身经营能力和今年提高的社会购买力，制订了今后一年或半年的业务计划。公私、工商、天津和外地间都建立了业务关系，订立了大批购销合同、协议。如棉织品专业会议上所订的合同、协议，即值二千多亿元，足够该业生产两月至两个半月。在百货专业会议上，生铅业与国营天津百货公司所订面盆、痰盂的购销协议数字，也相当该业一个半月至两个月的产量。
    在专业会议上发现了一般私营小工厂和手工业发展中的主要障碍是机构分散，生产设备和技术落后，经营管理方法保守。因此，各专业会议决定要求分散的小工厂、作坊和手工业者组织起来，加强联营，建立联合工厂。专业会议后，针织、棉织等行业已着手组织“天津漂染公司”，专作毛巾、袜子等的加工、整装工作，统一各小厂产品的规格、质量。机器工业也开始建立“示范工厂”，掌握先进生产设备和技术，制造比较标准的工具，领导同业改进生产。第十一区的十八家手工针织厂，已组织合作工厂一所，并已接受国营百货公司的委托加工袜子二千打。麻绳业一百零三户已组织联营社，且正在建立一处制麻工厂。此外，各行业中的有些工厂还把生产程序衔结起来，有的行业在同业厂、商间建立了联产、联销的组织。
    在各个专业会议上，天津市人民政府对私营工、商业的生产经营作了具体指导；国营贸易公司掌握了商品产销情况，进行了大量委托加工订货，这使一些夏季产、销清淡的行业维持了生产。（新华社）
    中南区的新稻和土产陆续收获后，农民的巨大购买力将从八月起开始涌入市场。中南区国营贸易公司现正积极准备供应农民的大批物资。根据中南军政委员会贸易部不久前召开的中南区各省、市人民政府工商厅、局长会议的决定，下半年全区贸易工作重点是收购粮食、土产和供应工业品和日用品。中南区国营贸易公司今年下半年棉纱销售量将比去年下半年实销量增加百分之八十六，布匹增加百分之一百一十五，百货增加百分之三百六十一，食油增加百分之二百五十六。中南区各地国营粮食公司现正紧张地修补和建筑储粮仓库，并正设法增加粮质化验工作人员和增设防湿工具和包装器材等。河南、广东等省国营粮食公司已开始大量收购小麦、早稻。中南区国营花纱布公司从区外调拨给区内各纺织工厂加工的棉纱、布匹，正向交通线和主要销地源源集中。为了保证军需、民用，供应城市复制工业生产的需要，防止商业投机现象的发生，河南省郑州、开封等市人民政府已加强棉纱市场管理。中南区国营百货公司今年下半年计划在区内以委托加工、订货办法采购的工业品和手工业品（区外调拨的不计），将比去年下半年增加六倍。
    为了完成今年秋后巨大的收购、供应任务，中南区各国营贸易公司决定在各县增设贸易机构；没有国营贸易公司机构的县份，将广泛派出流动收购小组和推销小组，深入初级市场。
    按：中南区由于全区半数以上人口的地区已经完成土地改革，百分之九十以上的土、特产销出，以及小麦和早稻丰收，农民购买力大为提高。一年半前就已完成了土地改革的河南省许昌专区，过去的贫农已有百分之四十上升为中农。
