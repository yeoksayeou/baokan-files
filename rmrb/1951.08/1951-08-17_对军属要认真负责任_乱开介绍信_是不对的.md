    Be Seriously Responsible for Military Dependents; “Randomly Issuing Letters of Introduction” is Wrong

To the Editor:

    I am writing to tell you about a case of irresponsibility towards a military dependent.

    Zhang Xuehong (female), a military dependent, is from Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, and lives on Xiangdong Street, Xiangdong District of the county. Because of financial difficulties, she requested the government to introduce her to a job. The People's Government of the street did not try to solve her employment problem, but irresponsibly issued a letter of introduction on July 3rd, asking her to find a solution with the Beijing Municipal People's Government. On July 5th, when Zhang Xuehong arrived in Wuhan, she ran out of travel expenses and asked the Wuhan Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau for relief. The Wuhan Municipal People's Government did not investigate and approved a subsidy of 60,000 yuan to allow her to come to Beijing. As a result, Zhang Xuehong brought her children and traveled thousands of miles to Beijing; however, because there were many difficulties in Beijing, after the relevant departments warmly comforted and explained the situation to her, they issued enough travel expenses for her to return to her hometown.

    I believe that it is a good phenomenon that military dependents request job introductions, and the local People's Government should try to solve the problem as much as possible. However, the above-mentioned irresponsible practice of randomly issuing letters of introduction and introducing military dependents to distant places thousands of miles away not only fails to solve the problems of military dependents, but also creates some waste for the country due to futile round trips. It is hoped that the relevant departments in Pingxiang County and the Wuhan Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau will review their "shirking responsibility" attitude towards military dependents, and it is hoped that similar situations will not occur in other regions.

                                                      Wei Min

### 对军属要认真负责任  “乱开介绍信”是不对的

    对军属要认真负责任  “乱开介绍信”是不对的编辑同志：
    我告诉你们一件对军属不负责任的事情。
    军属张学鸿（女），江西省萍乡县人，住该县湘东区湘东街。她因为生活困难，要求政府介绍职业。该街人民政府不设法代她解决职业问题，却不负责任地在七月三日开了介绍信让她到北京市人民政府想办法。七月五日，张学鸿到武汉时，因为路费用完了，就到武汉市人民政府民政局请求救济，武汉市人民政府也不加以审查，就补助她六万元，让她到北京来。于是张学鸿就带了子女、不远千里来到北京；结果因为在北京也有很多困难，经主管部门热情安慰解释，给她发足路费后，她又返回原籍。
    我认为：军属要求介绍职业，这是很好的现象，当地人民政府应尽可能地设法解决。但上述这种不负责任地乱开介绍信件、把军属介绍到数千里外远地的做法，不但不能解决军属的问题，徒劳往返，也给国家造成了一些浪费。希望萍乡县有关部门和武汉市民政局对军属“推出了事”的工作态度进行检讨，并希望其他地区不要发生类似情况。
                                                      魏民
