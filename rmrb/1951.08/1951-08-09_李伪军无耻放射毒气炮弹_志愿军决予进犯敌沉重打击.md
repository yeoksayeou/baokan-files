　　Li Pseudo-Army Shamelessly Employs Poison Gas Shells
　　  The Volunteer Army Resolves to Deal a Heavy Blow to the Invading Enemy
    【Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 7th】The Li Seung-man pseudo-army, coordinating with the American aggressor troops in their offensive north of Hwacheon, disregarded international law and shamefully fired poison gas shells at the 734 Height defended by the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on June 27th at noon. This type of shell was fired from a 60mm mortar, and after exploding, it emitted thick yellow-black smoke. Twenty-seven of our soldiers were poisoned on the spot, two of whom died.
    The shameless crime of the Li pseudo-army, following the American aggressor troops in using poison gas shells, has aroused great anger among the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army. They have vowed to inflict even heavier blows on the invading enemy.

　　李伪军无耻放射毒气炮弹
　　  志愿军决予进犯敌沉重打击
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】配合美国侵略军向华川以北冒犯之李承晚伪军，竟不顾国际公法，曾于六月二十七日中午向中国人民志愿军某部第五连守卫的七三四高地施射毒气炮弹。该种炮弹用六○炮射出，爆炸后冒黄黑色浓烟。我军当场有战士二十七人中毒，其中有二人牺牲。
    李伪军继美国侵略军之后使用毒气弹的无耻罪行，已激起志愿军指挥员和战斗员们的极大愤怒。他们立誓要给进犯的敌人以更沉重的打击。
