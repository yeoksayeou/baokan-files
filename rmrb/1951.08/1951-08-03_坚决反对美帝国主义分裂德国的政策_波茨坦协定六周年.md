　　Resolutely Oppose the U.S. Imperialist Policy of Splitting Germany
    —The Sixth Anniversary of the Potsdam Agreement
    Zhang Qihua
    Six years have passed today since the Soviet, American, and British governments signed the Potsdam Agreement on August 3, 1945. The main content of the Potsdam Agreement is the articles concerning the correct resolution of the German question after the war. Because of the aggression of militarist Germany, which had caused two world wars in the past half-century, a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany would be an important guarantee for maintaining peace in Europe and the world. Therefore, after defeating fascist Germany in World War II, the leaders of the wartime allies jointly formulated a program for eliminating German militarism and fascism and realizing a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany—the Potsdam Agreement—to consolidate peace in Europe and the world. In the six years from the signing of the Potsdam Agreement to the present, on the one hand, the Soviet government has been unswervingly implementing the terms of the Potsdam Agreement and striving for its thorough realization; on the other hand, the U.S. and British imperialists have deliberately split Germany, conspired to create wars, and violently undermined the solemn terms of the Potsdam Agreement they signed, thereby creating today's tense situation in Europe.
    The Soviet government has waged persistent struggles to thoroughly implement the Potsdam Agreement and establish a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany. At the London Foreign Ministers Conference in November-December 1947, the Warsaw Eight-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference in June 1948, the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference in May-June 1949, the Prague Eight-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference in October 1950, and the Four-Nation Foreign Ministers Assistant Conference in March-June of this year, the Soviet government has repeatedly put forward proposals and suggestions on implementing the elimination of German militarism and concluding a just peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible. From November of last year to February of this year, the Soviet government repeatedly sent notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, exposing their conspiracy to step up the arming of West Germany, and proposed convening a Four-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the implementation of the Potsdam Conference on the elimination of German militarism; and separately sent notes to the British and French governments, condemning them for violating the Potsdam Agreement and the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet treaties by preparing to conclude a military alliance with the West German puppet government. The Soviet Union's position and propositions have been warmly supported by the German people and the people of Europe and the world.
    In the six years since the war, the U.S. imperialists and their British and French lackeys have consistently pursued a war policy of splitting Germany, reviving German militarism, re-establishing German aggressive armed forces, and plotting to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries of Europe. They convened the London U.S., British, and French Foreign Ministers Conference and the Six-Nation Conference (in addition to the above three countries plus the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) and the New York Three-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference, illegally and unilaterally making a series of German policies that violated the Potsdam Agreement. They merged the occupation zones of the three countries, promulgated the so-called "Occupation Statute," implemented a separate currency "reform," fostered the divided Adenauer puppet government, restored the war economic production capacity of the Rhineland and Ruhr areas, released and re-used fascist Nazi elements and arms dealers and war criminals such as Krupp, suppressed the peace and democratic movements of the West German people, revived and equipped the West German army, in order to drive the German people to serve as cannon fodder for their aggressive wars.
    Especially since the Three-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference held in New York last September, the steps taken by the United States, Britain, and France to rearm West Germany militarily and economically have become more open and accelerated. Since the occupation by the United States, Britain, and France, they have created German mercenary troops with various names in West Germany, such as "Labor Battalions," "Defense Battalions," "Border Defense Battalions," "Industrial Police Battalions," etc. At present, they are unscrupulously preparing to establish so-called regular troops. The Bonn puppet government announced in April this year that West Germany would be divided into twelve military districts, and recruited new soldiers and established officer training schools. This government has also drafted a so-called "Armed Forces Law," formulating a plan to implement universal conscription in West Germany. Under the command of the American occupiers, this revived Nazi army will participate in the so-called European "Unified Army" and will serve as the main force in this Atlantic Group's European invasion army under the command of Eisenhower.
    Economically, West Germany is also increasingly on the path of war. West German industry is turning to arms production under the planning of the United States. The United States uses the "Schuman Plan" coal and steel joint venture as a chain to list West Germany's war industry on the U.S. war plan, so that West Germany becomes its arsenal in Europe. According to official statistics from the Bonn "government," the production index of West Germany's basic industries (steel, coal, etc.) that constitute the basis of arms production reached 120 percent of the 1936 monthly average in 1950, and the automobile industry (actually the armored vehicle industry) even reached 150 percent of 1936. At the same time, however, the production of daily necessities has not yet reached the pre-war level.
    The Soviet Union's faithful implementation of the Potsdam Agreement and the U.S., British, and French policies of preparing for war in Germany have profoundly educated the German people, greatly increased their awareness, and made them increasingly determined to embark on the road of struggling for the independence, democracy, and unification of their country. The German Democratic Republic was established in October 1949. The solemn terms of the Potsdam Agreement on eliminating German militarism and enabling the German people to rebuild their new lives on a democratic and peaceful basis have been fully realized in the Soviet-occupied eastern Germany. Thanks to the active support of the Soviet military occupation authorities and the Soviet government, this part of Germany has achieved fundamental reforms in political and economic life. A new democratic regime has been established. As a result of land reform, about 7,000 Junker landlords' 2,167,000 hectares of land were confiscated and distributed to 545,000 peasant, farm laborer, and immigrant families. Because the democratic government confiscated the industrial and enterprise properties of monopoly capitalists and Nazi war criminals and returned them to the state and the people, the power of monopoly capital has been fundamentally eliminated, and the conditions for building a peaceful industry of the people's own have been created on the basis of economic planning. The two-year economic plan for 1949-1950 was completed in one and a half years. The people's lives have generally been significantly improved, and the real income of the working people has greatly increased due to wage increases and price reductions. Since November 1948, state-owned stores have made seven major price cuts, reducing the price of food by 82.5 percent and the price of industrial products by 73.3 percent. Food consumption in 1950 was 150 percent higher than in 1948. Democratic reforms have also been implemented in schools, the bourgeois educational monopoly has been broken, and specialized schools have opened their doors to children of workers and peasants.
    In West Germany, due to the violation of the Potsdam Agreement by the occupying powers of the United States, Britain, and France, and the implementation of a policy of preparing for war to revive German militarism, the West German people are increasingly falling into the abyss of darkness and poverty. The working people of West Germany are the first to suffer from the disasters of the war preparation policy, namely higher occupation fees, higher taxes, higher prices, and a decline in living standards. In West Germany, the price of bread has risen by 50 percent in the past two years, the price of beef has risen by 104 percent, the prices of rent, water, and electricity have been increasing, and the prices of industrial products lacking due to the expansion of armaments have risen even more due to hoarding and speculation. The amount of taxes in 1951 exceeded one-third of that in 1950. The people's democratic rights have been completely deprived. Democratic newspapers are often confiscated and sealed up. Democratic parties and groups are subject to threats and intimidation. Peaceful marches are violently dispersed, and peace fighters are thrown into prison.
    Such two different realities of life and two different national futures cannot but arouse the awakening and struggle of the German people. The people of the German Democratic Republic are actively engaged in the construction of the new country with selfless spirit, and the entire German people are fighting heroically for a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany. The letter written by German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl to the Bonn "government" on December 30 last year, proposing to start negotiations with West Germany to establish an all-German constitutional conference, and the appeal made by the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to the Bonn Federal Assembly in February this year, have become the program of struggle for the entire German people. Adenauer and the Bonn parliament's unreasonable rejection of this proposal and appeal has aroused even greater anger among the German people and has further strengthened the struggle against the United States' rearmament of West Germany and the division of Germany. In January of this year, a conference attended by 1,700 representatives from all walks of life in Germany was held in Essen, the center of the Ruhr area in West Germany, to oppose remilitarization. The Central Committee of Germany Against Remilitarization was established in Düsseldorf, Rhine-Westphalia, in accordance with the resolution of the Essen Peace Congress, demanding a popular vote on opposing remilitarization and striving to conclude a peace treaty with Germany in 1951. In the Democratic Republic of Germany, the people's vote ended victoriously on June 5. Of the 13,581,099 valid votes, 95.98 percent opposed the rearmament of West Germany and demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany this year. In West Germany, the people's voting movement is continuing to unfold despite the suppression and prohibition of the Adenauer government. More than 90 percent of the West German people who participated in the vote have expressed their firm will to oppose remilitarization. There is no doubt that with the support of the Soviet Union and the people of all countries, the just struggle of the German people will finally defeat and bury the U.S. and British imperialist group's evil war policy of splitting Germany and achieve victory.
    The U.S., British, and French imperialists unreasonably rejected the Soviet representative's proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible and implement the Potsdam Agreement, and after rudely destroying the Four-Nation Foreign Ministers Assistant Conference, recently, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the governments of more than 40 countries, including Britain, France, Italy, Canada, and Mexico, unilaterally announced on July 9 "the end of the state of war with Germany." The United States also wrote a letter to Congress on July 9 by Truman, requesting the passage of a resolution "ending the state of war with Germany." The purpose of the U.S. and British imperialist group's so-called "end of the state of war with Germany" is to prolong the division of Germany, create another excuse to delay the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany as much as possible, and, while insisting on the division of Germany and obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, make West Germany "detach" from its current enemy status to these countries, so that it can join the North Atlantic aggressive group as an "equal" "ally," so that the United States can more freely arm West Germany.
    This step taken by U.S. imperialism and supported by the British and French governments has once again seriously violated the Potsdam Agreement. In order to speed up the pace of war preparations and attempt to put together that European unified invasion army, which still exists only on paper, as soon as possible, U.S. imperialism has to try to find ways to accelerate the establishment of the German aggressive army as the main force. However, the powerful force of the German and European people demanding peace has created great difficulties for U.S. imperialism's sinister conspiracy to arm West Germany and build an invasion army. U.S. imperialism, in the face of opposition from the entire German people and the European people, is attempting to rely on the defeated remnants of Nazism to launch a new world war. The German people and the European people must step up their struggle, completely smash the U.S. imperialist war plan, and strive to thoroughly implement the solemn terms of the Potsdam Agreement!

　　坚决反对美帝国主义分裂德国的政策
    ——波茨坦协定六周年
    张其华
    一九四五年八月三日，苏、美、英三国政府签定波茨坦协定，到今天已经六年了。波茨坦协定的主要内容，是关于正确解决战后德国问题的条款。由于军国主义的德国的侵略，在过去的半个世纪中，曾引起了两次世界大战，所以一个和平、民主、统一的德国将是维护欧洲和世界和平的重要保障。因此，在第二次世界大战击败了法西斯德国以后，战时盟国的领袖共同制定了肃清德国军国主义和法西斯主义，实现和平、民主、统一的德国的纲领——波茨坦协定，以巩固欧洲和世界的和平。从波茨坦协定签定到今天的六年中，一方面是苏联政府信守不渝地执行着波茨坦协定的条款，并为其彻底实现而奋斗；另一方面则是美、英帝国主义者蓄意分裂德国，阴谋制造战争，横暴地破坏了他们亲手签订的波茨坦协定的庄严条款，并从而造成了今天欧洲的紧张局势。
    苏联政府为彻底实现波茨坦协定，建立和平、民主、统一的德国，曾进行了坚持不懈的斗争。在一九四七年十一月——十二月的伦敦外长会议、一九四八年六月的华沙八国外长会议、一九四九年五月——六月的巴黎外长会议、一九五○年十月的布拉格八国外长会议，及今年三月——六月的四国外长助理会议上，苏联政府曾一再提出关于实行肃清德国的军国主义并尽速签定公正的对德和约的主张和建议。从去年十一月到今年二月间，苏联政府又数度照会美、英、法三国政府，揭露它们加紧武装西德的阴谋，并建议召开四国外长会议讨论波茨坦会议关于肃清德国军国主义的协定的实施问题；并分别照会英、法两国政府，斥责它们违反波茨坦协定和英苏、法苏条约准备与西德傀儡政府缔结军事同盟。苏联的这种立场和主张，得到了德国人民以及欧洲和全世界人民的热烈拥护。
    美帝国主义及其英、法仆从，在战后的六年中，一贯奉行分裂德国、复活德国军国主义、重新建立德国侵略武装、阴谋进攻苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家的战争政策。他们曾召开了伦敦美、英、法三国外长会议和六国会议（除上述三国之外加上荷、比、卢）及纽约三国外长会议，非法地、片面地做出了一系列的违反波茨坦协定的对德政策。它们合并了三国的占领区，颁布了所谓“占领法规”，施行了单独的货币“改革”，扶植起分裂的阿登纳傀儡政府，恢复莱茵和鲁尔区的战争经济生产能力，释放并起用法西斯纳粹分子和军火商人战争罪犯克虏伯等，镇压西德人民的和平运动和民主运动，复活和装备西德军队，以便驱使德国人民充当其侵略战争的炮灰。
    特别是自去年九月在纽约召开三国外长会议以来，美、英、法三国在军事上和经济上重新武装西德的步骤就更为公开和加速了。自从美、英、法占领以来，它们在西德制造出带有各种各样名目的德国雇佣兵部队，如“劳动大队”、“防卫大队”、“边防大队”、“工业警察大队”等等，目前则正在肆无忌惮地准备建立所谓正规部队。波恩傀儡政府今年四月已经宣布把西德分为十二个军区，并征募新兵和设立军官训练学校。这个政府还草拟了所谓“武装部队法”，制订在西德实行普遍征兵的计划。在美国占领者的指挥下，这支复活的纳粹军队将参加所谓欧洲“统一军”，并将在艾森豪威尔统率下的这支大西洋集团欧洲侵略军中充当主力。
    在经济上，西德也日益走上战争的轨道。西德的工业正在美国的策划下转向军备生产，美国以“舒曼计划”的煤钢联营这一条锁链，将西德的战争工业列在美国的战争计划上，以便使西德变为它在欧洲的兵工厂。根据波恩“政府”的官方统计，西德构成军备生产的基础工业（钢煤等），其生产指数在一九五○年每月平均产量已经达到一九三六年的百分之一百二十，自动车工业（实际就是装甲车工业）竟达到一九三六年的百分之一百五十。但同时，民用必需品的生产却连战前的水平也还远没有达到。
    苏联对波茨坦协定的忠实执行和美、英、法在德国的备战政策，深刻地教育了德国人民，大大提高了他们的觉悟，并使他们日益坚决地走上为争取自己国家的独立、民主、统一而斗争的道路。一九四九年十月德意志民主共和国成立了。波茨坦协定关于肃清德国军国主义并使德国人民在民主与和平的基础上重新建立新生活的庄严条款，已在苏占区的东部德国充分实现。由于苏军占领机构和苏联政府的积极支持，德国的这一部分达到了政治生活和经济生活的基本改造。新的民主政权建立了。土地改革的结果，没收了七千左右容克地主所据有的二百一十六万七千公顷的土地，分给了五十四万五千农民、雇农和移民家庭。由于民主政府没收了独占资本家和纳粹战犯的工业和企业财产，归于国家和人民所有，独占资本的势力已被根本肃清，并且在经济计划的基础上创立了建设一个人民自己的和平工业的条件。一九四九——一九五○年的二年经济计划以一年半的时间就完成了。人民的生活普遍地得到显著的改善，劳动人民的实际收入，因工资的增加和物价的减低而大大地提高。从一九四八年十一月以来国营商店七次大减价，使食物的价格降低了百分之八十二·五，工业品的价格降低了百分之七十三·三。一九五○年的食物消费量已高于一九四八年百分之一百五十。学校也实行了民主改革，资产阶级的教育独占被打破了，专门学校为工农子弟开了大门。
    在西德，由于美、英、法三国占领者违反波茨坦协定，执行了复活德国军国主义的备战政策，而使西德人民日益陷入黑暗贫困的深渊。西德劳动人民首先遭受了备战政策的灾害，即更高的占领费、更高的捐税、更高的物价和生活水平的下降。西德两年来面包的价格上涨了百分之五十，牛肉上涨了百分之一百零四，房租、水电等价格日益提高，因扩张军备而缺乏的工业用品由于居奇投机，价格更形上升。一九五一年的捐税额又超过了一九五○年的三分之一。人民民主权利被剥夺殆尽。民主报纸经常被没收和查封。民主党派和团体都要受到威胁恫吓。争取和平的游行都被凶暴地驱散，和平战士被投入狱中。
    这样的两种不同的实际生活状况和两种不同的国家前途，不能不激起德国人民的觉醒和斗争。德意志民主共和国的人民正以忘我的精神积极从事新国家的建设，全德国人民正在为争取和平、民主、统一的德国而英勇斗争。德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在去年十二月三十日，为建议与西德开始商谈建立全德立宪会议而写给波恩“政府”的信，和今年二月德意志民主共和国人民议会致波恩联邦议会的呼吁，已经成为全德人民的斗争纲领。阿登纳和波恩议会对这建议和呼吁的无理拒绝，愈益引起了德国人民的巨大愤怒，并更加强了反对美国重新武装西德和分裂德国的斗争。今年一月在西德鲁尔区的中心埃森城内即召开了一个由德国各阶层人民一千七百位代表参加的反对重新军国主义化的大会。在莱茵——威斯特伐利亚州的杜塞尔多夫城成立了德国反对重新军国主义化中央委员会，按照埃森和平代表大会的决议，要求举行关于反对重新军国主义化并争取在一九五一年内缔结对德和约的人民投票。在民主德国，人民投票已于六月五日胜利结束。在一千三百五十八万一千零九十九张有效票中，百分之九十五点九八的人，是反对重新武装西德与要求在今年内缔结对德和约的。在西德，人民投票运动不顾阿登纳政府的镇压与禁止，仍在继续展开。百分之九十以上参加投票的西德人民，已表明了他们反对重新军国主义化的坚决意志。毫无疑问，在苏联和各国人民的支援下，德国人民的正义斗争必将最后击败和埋葬美英帝国主义集团分裂德国的罪恶战争政策而取得胜利。
    美、英、法帝国主义无理地拒绝苏联代表关于尽早缔结对德和约实行波茨坦协定的提议，而粗暴地破坏了四国外长助理会议之后，最近，在美帝国主义指使之下，英国、法国、意大利、加拿大、墨西哥等四十余个国家的政府，于七月九日起，片面地宣告“结束对德战争状态”。美国亦于七月九日由杜鲁门写信给国会，要求通过决议“结束对德战争状态”。美英帝国主义集团的所谓“结束对德战争状态”的目的，就在于要延长德国的分裂，制造另一个借口来尽可能地拖延缔结对德和约，并在坚持分裂德国和阻挠缔结对德和约的情况下，使西德“脱离”目前对这些国家所处的敌国地位，以作为这些国家“平等的”“盟友”而加入北大西洋侵略集团，以便美国可以更加放手地武装西德。
    美国帝国主义所采取而为英、法政府所支持的这一步骤，又一次严重地破坏了波茨坦协定。为了加紧战争准备的步伐，企图早日拼凑起那支至今还在纸上的欧洲统一侵略军，美帝国主义就不得不试寻办法以加速建立作为主力的德国侵略军队。但是，德国及欧洲人民要求和平的强大力量，给美帝国主义武装西德和建立侵略军的罪恶阴谋造成了极大的困难。美帝国主义在全德人民和欧洲人民的反对下，企图依靠失败了的纳粹残余势力而发动新的世界战争，德国人民和欧洲人民必须加紧斗争，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的战争计划，争取彻底实现波茨坦协定的庄严条款！
