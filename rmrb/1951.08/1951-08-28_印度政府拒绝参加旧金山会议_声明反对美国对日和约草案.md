Xinhua News Agency, August 27th:
　　The Indian Chargé d'Affaires in the United States, Kebal Ram, delivered a note to John Foster Dulles, Special Representative of President Truman responsible for drafting the peace treaty with Japan, on August 23, declaring that the Indian government opposes the US draft peace treaty with Japan and refuses to attend the San Francisco Conference.
    Prior to this, the United States had distributed its draft peace treaty with Japan to the Indian government in mid-July and "invited" the Indian government to attend the San Francisco Conference and sign the draft. On July 30, the Indian government submitted suggestions regarding the peace treaty with Japan to the US government, advocating the return of Taiwan to China, the return of the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin to the Soviet Union, and opposing the continued stationing of US troops in Japan and the "trusteeship" of the Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands after the peace treaty. However, the US government completely disregarded India's suggestions in its note responding to India's suggestions and in the final draft of the peace treaty with Japan published on August 15. As a result, the Indian government decided not to attend the San Francisco Conference.
    According to a United Press report from Washington on August 26, the original text of Kebal Ram's note to Dulles is as follows:
    Dear Ambassador:
    I wish to convey to you the Indian government's note in response to your government's notification inviting our country to attend the conference on the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, which will be held in San Francisco on September 4, 1951.
    I. The Indian government is pleased and grateful to inform you that the United States government's response to the Indian government's suggestions regarding the peace treaty with Japan, submitted in the note of July 30, 1951, has been received. The Indian government fully appreciates the United States government's consideration of its views and wishes to assure the United States government that this response was drafted in a spirit of candor and friendship towards the United States government and the American people.
    II. In the course of the various negotiations between the two governments on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, the Indian government has consistently emphasized two basic objectives: (1) The terms of the peace treaty should give Japan a glorious, equal, and satisfactory position in the family of free nations. (2) These terms should be drafted in such a way that all countries, especially those with a vested interest in maintaining a stable peace in the Far East, will sooner or later sign the treaty. After careful consideration, the Indian government has come to the conclusion that the treaty fails to meet either of these criteria in many respects.
    III. Condition 1. A. It is perfectly natural for Japan to hope to fully restore its sovereignty over territories where local residents have historical ties with the Japanese people and which were not acquired from other countries through aggression. The Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands fully meet these conditions. However, the treaty suggests that they should continue to be subject to US legislative and administrative control until the US government requests and obtains trusteeship of these islands. The Indian government believes that this approach will only become a source of dissatisfaction for a large segment of the Japanese people and inevitably contains the seeds of future disputes and possible conflicts in the Far East.
    B. The Indian government recognizes that, as an independent country, Japan has the right to conclude security defense agreements in accordance with Article 5 of the treaty. No one can reasonably object if Japan exercises this right to conclude defense agreements with friendly countries. However, the Japanese government should exercise this right only when Japan becomes a truly independent country. The provision in the treaty that the current occupying forces will continue to remain in Japan as part of this defense agreement will inevitably create the impression that this agreement is not a decision made by Japan as an independent country, fully enjoying its freedom. This will not only affect the Japanese people, but also a large part of the people of Asia, and the impact will inevitably be extremely unfortunate.
    IV. Condition 2. As stated earlier, the Indian government attaches extreme importance to the provision in the treaty for the return of the island of Taiwan to China. The timing and manner of this return may be subjects for further negotiation. However, in the Indian government's view, it is neither just nor wise to disregard past international agreements in a document that attempts to regulate the relations between Japan and all the governments that fought against it in the last war, and to leave the future of the island undetermined. The same reasoning also applies to the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin.
    V. For the above reasons, the Indian government regrets to decide that they cannot participate in this treaty. They sincerely hope that lasting peace will come to the Far East, and for this purpose, will continue to cooperate with the government of the United States and the governments of other countries in ways that are consistent with the principles on which their foreign policy is based. As a first step, they intend to end the state of war between them and Japan as soon as it can be implemented and establish formal diplomatic relations with that country.
    VI. The United States government has announced that at the conference in San Francisco to consider the draft peace treaty with Japan, although participating countries are free to express their views on the treaty, there is no room for discussion at the meeting. India feels that the views on the treaty expressed in this reply are sufficient to indicate their attitude towards the conference. They intend to submit this reply to their parliament, which is meeting on August 27, and if the United States does not object. Once this document is published, it can be submitted to the San Francisco Conference for reference, and the Indian government will be happy if the United States government, as the host of the conference, is willing to circulate this reply to the member states. Because the Indian government cannot sign the treaty for the aforementioned reasons, they believe that it is not necessary to send representatives to attend the conference.
    VII. The Indian government wishes to know whether the United States government objects to notifying our parliament of this reply on Monday, August 27, 1951.
    Please accept the highest respects.
          Kebal Ram
          Chargé d'Affaires

### 印度政府拒绝参加旧金山会议  声明反对美国对日和约草案

　　印度政府拒绝参加旧金山会议
    声明反对美国对日和约草案
    【新华社二十七日讯】印度驻美国临时代办克巴兰尼，于八月二十三日致负责制订对日和约草案的杜鲁门特别代表杜勒斯照会一件，声明印度政府反对美国对日和约草案，并拒绝参加旧金山会议。
    在此以前美国曾于七月中旬将其对日和约草案分发给印度政府，并“邀请”印度政府出席旧金山会议，签署该项草案。印度政府在七月三十日向美国政府提出了关于对日和约的建议，主张台湾归还中国，千岛群岛与库页岛南部归还苏联，并反对美国在媾和后继续驻军日本和“托管”琉球与小笠原群岛等。但是，美国政府在其答复印度建议的照会与八月十五日公布的对日和约草案定本中，完全无视印度的建议。至此，印度政府决定不参加旧金山会议。
    据合众社华盛顿二十六日讯，克巴兰尼致杜勒斯的照会原文如下：
    亲爱的大使先生：
    我愿向你转交印度政府的照会，答复贵国政府邀请我国参加一九五一年九月四日在旧金山召开的签订对日和约会议的通知。
    一、印度政府荣幸地并且感谢地通知你：美国政府对印度政府在一九五一年七月三十日的照会中提出的关于对日和约的建议的答复已经收到了。印度政府充分感谢美国政府考虑它的意见，并愿向美国政府保证：这个答复是根据坦白诚恳和对美国政府与美国人民友好的精神拟定的。
    二、在两国政府就对日和约问题举行的历次谈判中，印度政府一直强调两个基本的目标：（一）对日和约的条款应该给日本以在自由国家大家庭中的光荣、平等与满意的地位。（二）这些条款应该拟订得使所有国家，特别是那些与维持远东的稳固和平有利害关系的国家早晚都在和约上签字。印度政府经过深思熟虑后得出一个结论，即和约在许多方面都不能满足这两项准绳的任何一项。
    三、条件一。甲、日本希望充分恢复它对那些当地居民与日本本国人民有历史血缘关系并且不是用侵略手段从其他国家取得的领土的主权，是十分自然的。琉球与小笠原群岛充分符合这些条件。但是和约建议：在美国政府要求并且取得这些岛屿的托管权之前，它们应继续受美国的立法与行政管制。印度政府认为这种办法只会成为使很大部分日本人民不满的根源，一定包含着远东未来纠纷与可能的冲突的种子。
    乙、印度政府承认，作为一个自主国，日本有权按照和约第五条的规定缔结安全防御协定。如果日本行使这个权利与友好国家缔结防御协定，没有人能有理由来加以反对。但是日本政府应该在日本成为真正的自主国时再行使这个权利。和约中规定目前的占领军继续留驻日本作为这种防御协定的一部分的条款，一定会产生一种印象，使人感到：这种协定并不是日本作为一个自主国，充分享有它的自由而作的决定。这一点不仅影响日本人民，而且影响亚洲的很大部分人民，这种影响必然是极不幸的。
    四、条件二。前已声明，印度政府极端重视条约中规定将台湾岛归还中国。这种归还的时间和方式或许可以是另外的谈判的题目。但是把一项企图规定日本和在上次战争中对它作战的一切政府之间的关系的文件中的过去的国际协议置之不顾，而对该岛的前途不加确定，在印度政府看来，是既不公正又非得策。同样的理由也适用于千岛群岛与南库页岛。
    五、由于上述理由，印度政府遗憾地决定他们不能参加这项条约。他们诚恳希望持久和平将降临远东，并且为了这个目的，将采取他们可以采取的符合于他们外交政策所依据之原则的方式继续与美国政府及其他国家的政府合作。作为第一步，他们打算在一旦可以实行时即尽速结束他们和日本之间的战争状态并与该国建立正式的外交关系。
    六、美国政府已宣布，在旧金山召开的考虑对日和约草案的会议上，虽然参加国家可以自由陈述它们对和约的意见，但会上并无商讨的余地，印度觉得在这个复文中所陈述的印度对和约的意见，足可表明他们对会议的态度。他们打算把这个复文提交八月二十七日正在开会的他们的议会，如果美国不反对的话。这一文件一旦公布，即可提交旧金山会议参考，如果美国政府作为该会议的东主愿将这个复文交各会员国传阅，印度政府将很高兴。因为前述理由印度政府不能签订和约，因此他们认为没有必要派代表参加该会议。
    七、印度政府愿意知道美国政府是否反对将这个复文在一九五一年八月二十七日星期一通知我们议会。
    谨致最高敬意。
          临时代办克巴兰尼
