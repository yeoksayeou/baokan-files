　　A Volunteer Soldier's Letter
    To all comrades attending Military Cadre School:

    I remember in late January of this year, when we were heroically resisting the advancing American invading army north of the Han River, a message came from our distant motherland—young workers and students across the country were enthusiastically joining the Military Cadre School. Comrades, I cannot express how warmly this news was received in our unit. Many comrades jumped for joy. That day, I was lying in a snow trench, the artillery fire in front of me still roaring, enemy planes circling wildly overhead, but I couldn't hear any of it. I read and reread the People's Daily, which had been transported to us with great difficulty. Every word, every sentence, seemed ten times more intimate than usual. Comrades, you don't know how long it had been since we had seen a newspaper from our motherland. Once we went abroad to fight, we were chasing after the enemy, and for several months we hadn't had enough spiritual nourishment. Once we saw the newspaper, it was as if we saw our motherland, as if we saw the people of our motherland. The news of the comrades' first participation in the Military Cadre School was seen in it. I happily went everywhere to "broadcast" it. The comrades cheered and said, "Let the American big noses come! Let's see how many heads you have!"

    Similarly, today I read more news about comrades stepping onto the glorious posts of defending the motherland. Your actions have once again given us great encouragement and strengthened our determination to kill the enemy. Comrades, you are the outstanding sons and daughters of New China, the new soldiers of the Mao Zedong era! You have maintained and carried forward the revolutionary tradition of Chinese youth, and you have already answered the solemn call of the motherland and the people with practical actions. Your high patriotic enthusiasm shows that China's revolutionary force is strong, inexhaustible and inexhaustible.

    Comrades, your great actions have inspired millions of sons and daughters of the motherland fighting the American invading army on the Korean front. With your support, they will advance more bravely. I hope you study hard, and after graduation, stand on glorious posts, defend our great motherland and people, and defend peace in the Far East and the world. If the enemy dares to invade us, we will wipe them out completely.

    Comrades! Work hard! Let our generation of young people shine with infinite brilliance in the glorious Mao Zedong era!
        With
    High revolutionary salute!
                     Soldier Tu Shouchun, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
                  July 20th, on the Korean Front

　　志愿军来信
    给参加军事干部学校的同学们
    参加军事干部学校的全体同学们：
    记得在今年的元月下旬，我们正在汉江南岸英勇地抗击着向北冒险进犯的美国侵略军的时候，一个消息从辽远的祖国传来了——全国青年工人、学生，正踊跃地参加军事干部学校。同学们，我无法告诉你们这个消息在我们部队里引起了多么热烈的反应。好多同志高兴得跳起来了。那一天，我正仰卧在一条雪沟里，前面的炮声隆隆未绝，敌机在我们的头上瞎转，但我听不到这一切，我把经过了若干困难才运输到我们手上的人民日报读了又读，上面的每一个字，每一句话，看来比平时要亲切十倍。同学们，你们不知道，我们有多久没有看见过祖国的报纸了。一出国作战，就在追歼敌人，好几个月没有得到足够的精神食粮。一旦看到了报纸，真好象看见了我们的祖国，看见了祖国的人民一样。同学们第一次参加军事干部学校的消息，就是在这上面看见的。我高兴地到处去“广播”。同志们都欢呼着说：“美国大鼻子们来吧！看你们究竟有多少脑袋？”
    同样地，今天我又读到了更多的同学们走上了保卫祖国光荣岗位的消息。你们的行动，再一次给了我们以极大的鼓励，加强了我们杀敌的决心。同学们，你们是新中国的优秀的儿女，是毛泽东时代的新战士！你们保持并发扬了中国青年的革命传统，你们已经用实际行动响亮地回答了祖国与人民的庄严号召。你们高度的爱国热情，表明了中国的革命力量是雄厚无比的，是取之不尽，用之不竭的。
    同学们，你们伟大的行动已经鼓舞了千百万在朝鲜前线与美国侵略军作战的祖国儿女。他们将在你们的支持下，更勇敢地前进。希望你们好好学习，毕业后，站在光荣的岗位上，保卫我们伟大的祖国与人民，保卫远东与世界的和平。如果敌人敢于侵犯我们，我们就要把它消灭干净。
    同学们！努力吧！让我们这一代的青年，在光辉的毛泽东时代发出万丈光芒吧！
        此致
    崇高的革命敬礼！
                     中国人民志愿军某部战士涂寿春
                  七月二十日于朝鲜前线
