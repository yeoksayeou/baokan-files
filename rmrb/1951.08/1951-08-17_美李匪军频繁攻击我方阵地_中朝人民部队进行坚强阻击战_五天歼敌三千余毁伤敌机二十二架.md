Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 16th—Our front-line reporter reports: While the U.S. side obstructs the Korean armistice talks, the U.S. invading army and the Li pseudo-army continue to launch frequent attacks on our positions. From August 6th to 10th, the U.S. and Li armies launched continuous attacks ranging from dozens to a battalion of men in areas north and northwest of Lianchuan on the western front, north and east of Jinhua, north of Huachuan, and north of Yangkou and Lin'e on the eastern front. In the eastern front area, the U.S. and Li armies, in coordination with tanks and artillery, launched attacks on certain targets as many as ten times a day. These attacks occurred repeatedly as the U.S. side blatantly obstructed the armistice negotiations, thus arousing the boundless anger of the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. In the above-mentioned areas, they repelled and inflicted casualties on the invading enemy with a more resolute blocking war. On August 10th, a certain unit holding a certain height north of Lin'e bravely repelled eleven fierce attacks by a battalion of the Li pseudo-army, killing or wounding more than 130 of them. On the same day, the unit repelled continuous fierce attacks by another battalion of the Li pseudo-army on another height, killing or wounding more than 80 of them. A certain unit holding a certain height east of Jinhua continuously repelled several attacks by a U.S. company on the 9th and 10th, killing or wounding more than 100 enemies. According to statistics, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies annihilated more than 3,000 enemies in the five days from August 6th to 10th, of which more than 1,700 were U.S. soldiers. In addition, they destroyed nine enemy tanks and six vehicles. In these five days, the anti-aircraft artillery units shot down or damaged a total of 22 enemy aircraft in the skies above the front and rear.

    中朝人民部队进行坚强阻击战     
    五天歼敌三千余毁伤敌机二十二架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十六日电】本社前线记者报道：与美方阻挠朝鲜停战谈判会议的同时，美国侵略军和李伪军继续向我阵地进行频繁的攻击。从八月六日到十日，美、李军在西线的涟川以北及西北，金化以东以北，华川以北，和东线的杨口、麟蹄以北等地区，发动了数十人到一营人的连续攻击。在东线地区，美、李军在战车和炮兵的配合下，对某个目标的攻击每日有多至十次以上者。这种攻击行动一再发生在美方露骨地阻挠停战谈判之际，因而更激起了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军指挥员、战斗员们的无比愤怒。他们在上述地区以更坚强的阻击战，打退和杀伤进犯的敌人。八月十日，坚守在麟蹄以北某高地的某部，奋勇击退李伪军一个营的十一次猛攻，并杀伤其一百三十多名。该部并于同日在另一高地击退李伪军另一个营的连续猛攻，并杀伤其八十多名。坚守在金化以东某高地的某部，于九、十两日连续击退美军一个连的多次攻击，并杀伤敌百余名。据统计，中朝人民军队在八月六日至十日的五天中，共计歼敌三千多名，其中美军占一千七百多人，另外，并击毁敌战车九辆，汽车六辆。在这五天中，对空射击部队在前线与后方的上空共计击落、击伤敌机二十二架。
