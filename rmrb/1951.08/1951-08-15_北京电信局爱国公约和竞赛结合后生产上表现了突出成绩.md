Bring together patriotic pledges and labor competitions!

　　Outstanding Production Achievements After Combining Patriotic Pledges and Competition in the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau
    Editor:
    Since July, when the employees of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau combined patriotic pledges with labor competitions, they have made significant achievements in production.
    The patriotic pledges of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau were established after extensive patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea was conducted in April, and the political consciousness of the employees was generally enhanced. Initially, the content of the group pledges was mostly empty political slogans, and the promotion of production was not significant. Many groups participating in labor competitions felt deeply that the power could not be concentrated if the patriotic pledges were not combined with the labor competitions. Therefore, at the end of May, the trade union focused on cultivating two advanced groups, such as Liang Qinghua's, to combine their patriotic pledges with labor competitions.
    In July, the advanced group experience of combining patriotic pledges with labor competitions was promoted, and the employees' patriotic collective heroism and work enthusiasm greatly increased. For example, by the end of July, the Municipal Telephone Office had cancelled 455 non-compliant user accounts, increased the number of guided paging calls to more than 62,000, and developed 257 shared telephone lines. These achievements alone increased the state's monthly income by approximately 60 million yuan.
    Why could such achievements be made after combining patriotic pledges and labor competitions? This is because the combination made the political goals of the competition clearer, and all units regarded completing the competition conditions as concrete actions to resist America, aid Korea, and consolidate national defense. Employees often encouraged each other with "To be patriotic is to do a good job." This corrected some of the championship mentality that existed in past labor competitions. At the same time, this made patriotic education more frequent and concrete, effectively promoting current work. Many things that were impossible in the past have now become possible. Workers in the Vehicle Dispatch Room of the Supply Section actively studied technology and learned to repair cars themselves. Recently, when the axle tiles were damaged, the employees learned sand casting and made the axle tiles themselves. In the past, repairing each car outside cost more than 10 million yuan. Now, repairing them ourselves, it is estimated that four cars would only cost 4 million yuan. These phenomena had never occurred when patriotic pledges and labor competitions were not combined.

### 北京电信局爱国公约和竞赛结合后生产上表现了突出成绩

　　北京电信局爱国公约和竞赛结合后生产上表现了突出成绩
    编辑同志：
    北京电信局职工，从七月份把爱国公约与劳动竞赛结合起来以后，在生产上已经有了显著的成绩。
    北京电信局的爱国公约，是在四月份广泛进行抗美援朝爱国主义教育后，职工政治觉悟普遍提高的基础上陆续订立起来的。开始时，小组公约的内容大部分是比较空洞的政治口号，对生产的推动作用也不显著。很多参加劳动竞赛的小组更深深感到：爱国公约和劳动竞赛不结合起来力量就不能集中。因此，工会在五月底重点培养了梁庆华等两个先进小组，使他们把爱国公约和劳动竞赛结合起来。
    七月份，推广了爱国公约结合劳动竞赛的先进小组经验，职工的爱国集体英雄主义和工作积极性大大提高。如：市电话处到七月底取缔种类不符用户达四百五十五户，指导传呼电话次数增加到六万二千多次，发展合用电话二百五十七号。这些成绩就使国家每月增加收入约六千余万元。
    为什么爱国公约和劳动竞赛结合以后能够取得这样的成绩呢？这是由于两者相结合，使竞赛的政治目标更加明确，各单位都把完成竞赛条件作为抗美援朝、巩固国防的具体行动。职工们经常以“爱国就要搞好工作”来互相勉励。这样就纠正了过去劳动竞赛中存在的某些锦标主义的思想。同时，这样也就使爱国主义教育成为经常的、具体的，有力地推动了当前工作。很多过去不可能做到的事，现在成为可能了。供应科配车室工人积极钻研技术，学会了自己修理汽车。最近轴瓦坏了，职工自己学习翻砂，自己制出轴瓦。以前在外面修理汽车每辆要一千多万元，现在自己修，估计四辆车有四百万元就够了。这些现象都是爱国公约和劳动竞赛没有结合起来的时候所没有过的。
