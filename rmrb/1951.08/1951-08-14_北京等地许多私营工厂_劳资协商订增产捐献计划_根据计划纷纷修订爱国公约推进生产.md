[Report from this newspaper] Many small and medium-sized private factories in Beijing, as well as the Qixin Cement Factory in Tangshan, the Tianxing Casting Pot Factory in Shijiazhuang, and others, are implementing a method of having workers and capitalists negotiate and establish production increase and donation plans to launch a donation of weapons movement.

Of the more than 400 small and medium-sized private factories in Beijing, nearly half have trade union organizations leading workers in consultations with capitalists, initially formulating six-month patriotic production increase and donation plans. It is estimated that the value of production can be increased by more than 38 billion yuan within six months. Many factory trade unions have conducted patriotic education for workers, mobilizing the masses to think of various ways to increase production, and then consulting with capitalists to establish contracts and determine goals. The trade union of the China Science Company Glass Factory, based on patriotic education, mobilized employees to improve production. After active research by the workers, fuel alone can save more than 10 million yuan in coal consumption in half a year. The grass-roots committee of the Yihe Paper Mill trade union, based on the opinions discussed by each group, studied the factory's machine efficiency and improved operating methods, and initially drafted a daily production plan. Then, after consulting with the capitalists, it was stipulated that the daily production quota of paper would be 85 reams, and each ream of paper exceeding the quota would be rewarded with five kilograms of millet. After both parties agreed, a contract was signed. The trade union also mobilized workers to discuss the goals of increasing production and donation methods, planning to overproduce by 8% every day and donate 58% of the bonus from the excess production. It is estimated that 7,000 kilograms of millet can be donated within half a year. To achieve this plan, the workers established a shift handover system. The trade union established a core group to lead production, specializing in studying some issues of improving production. Many factories combined patriotic production increases and donations to revise patriotic pledges and launch competitions. Trade union organizations such as the Gongji Material Factory, Yihe Paper Factory, Dahua Pottery Company Factory, and China Science Company Factory mobilized workers to check and revise the patriotic pledges when ordering patriotic production increase and donation plans, and initially corrected the shortcomings of the empty content of the patriotic pledges, included the donation plan in the patriotic pledge, and carried out competition activities based on groups. So far, the production of the Yihe Paper Mill has exceeded the quota by 20%, and the daily consumption of waste products has dropped from 1,050 kilograms to 350 kilograms, exceeding the specified goal in the donation plan.

Labor and management of the Tangshan Qixin Cement Factory enthusiastically responded to the call of the General Association for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea and actively participated in the donation of airplanes and cannons movement. Many employees requested to donate one day's work per month, donating 360 million yuan by the end of the year; in addition, the employees also donated more than 100 million yuan in cash. The factory's capitalists (including Tianjin General Company of Qixin Cement Company) also decided to donate three fighter jets and one anti-aircraft gun. In the donation movement, all factory employees, in order to support the patriotic actions of the capitalists, proposed to "persist in the patriotic labor competition," and the capitalists also proposed to "strive to improve business management." On this basis, the Qixin Cement Factory Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed to the factory to increase the production plan for the second half of the year by 29%. This suggestion has been adopted by the factory's capitalists and has received the active support of the trade union. All factory employees are working hard to implement this plan in conjunction with the inspection and revision of the patriotic pledge movement.

The Shijiazhuang Tianxing Casting Pot Factory, a private factory in Hebei Province, revised its patriotic pledge and formulated a production increase and donation plan for the second half of the year. Labor and management agreed: 15 tons of iron pots will be produced in six months, and 8,000 kilograms of coke will be saved. The capitalists will donate at least 4.38 million yuan in excess profits; employees will donate 1.314 million yuan in bonuses. In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, labor and management of the Tianxing Casting Pot Factory had signed a patriotic pledge and established a labor-management consultation meeting based on the patriotic pledge. Since May 28, a patriotic labor competition has been launched. During the competition, 886.5 jin of large pots and 3,235.4 jin of small pots were overproduced, and 2,975.5 jin of coke were saved. A total of 3,075,560 yuan in excess profits were obtained. In mid-July, labor and management, combined with the labor competition in June, inspected the previous patriotic pledge and formulated a production increase and donation plan for the second half of the year. The factory originally planned to produce 260 tons of iron pots throughout the year, and 110 tons had been produced in the first half of the year, with 150 tons remaining in the second half of the year. In order to produce more and donate more, all factory employees decided that in addition to ensuring the completion of the quota of 2,800 jin of iron pots per day, they would also increase the production of iron pots by 250 jin and save 65 jin of coke. It is calculated that within six months, 15 tons of iron pots can be overproduced, and 8,000 kilograms of coke can be saved. Calculated at an average profit of 420 yuan per jin of iron pot and 250 yuan per jin of coke, the income can be increased by 14.6 million yuan. 10% of this increased income will be used as workers' welfare funds, 30% will be used as bonuses, and the factory will receive an excess profit of 8.76 million yuan. The capitalists proposed to donate at least 50% (4.38 million yuan) to airplanes and cannons, and the employees proposed to donate 30% (1.314 million yuan) of the excess bonus to purchase "Shijiazhuang Workers" airplanes. In the plan, the workers put forward specific methods to improve technology and increase production. The capitalists also proposed to guarantee the expansion of sales channels, supply raw materials, and improve workers' food and sanitation conditions to protect workers' health. Labor and management also revised the patriotic pledge based on this plan. It is stipulated that it will be implemented from July 19 and checked every half month.

　　北京等地许多私营工厂
    劳资协商订增产捐献计划
    根据计划纷纷修订爱国公约推进生产
    【本报讯】北京市许多中小型私营工厂及唐山启新洋灰工厂、石家庄市私营天兴铸锅厂等，实行职工与资方协商订立增产捐献计划的办法，开展捐献武器运动。
    北京市四百余家中小型私营工厂，已有将近半数工厂的工会组织领导职工与资方协商，初步订出了半年的爱国增产捐献计划，估计半年内可增加生产价值三百八十余亿元。许多工厂的工会对工人进行了爱国主义的教育，发动群众想各种增加生产的办法，然后与资方协商，订立合同，确定奋斗目标。中华科学公司玻璃工厂工会在爱国主义教育的基础上，发动职工改进生产，经工人积极研究后，仅燃料一项，半年即可减省煤耗值千余万元。义和造纸厂工会基层委员会，依各小组讨论的意见，研究了该厂机器效能与改进操作方法等问题之后，初步拟具了每日生产计划，然后与资方协商，规定每日产纸定额为八十五令，超过定额的产量，每令纸奖励小米五斤，经双方同意，签订了合同。工会又发动工人讨论了增产的目标和捐献办法，计划每日超额生产百分之八，从超额奖金中捐献百分之五十八，预计半年内可捐献七千斤小米。为了实现此一计划，工人们建立了交接班制度；工会成立了领导生产的核心小组，专门研究改进生产的一些问题。不少工厂结合爱国增产捐献，修订爱国公约，展开竞赛。公记料器工厂、义和造纸工厂、大华窑业公司工厂和中华科学公司工厂等的工会组织，在订爱国增产捐献计划时，都发动工人检查修订了爱国公约，初步纠正了爱国公约内容空洞的缺点，把捐献计划列入爱国公约，并以小组为基础，开展了竞赛运动。到目前为止，义和造纸厂生产已超过定额百分之二十，每天因废品的消耗由一千零五十斤下降到三百五十斤，超过了捐献计划中的规定目标。
    唐山启新洋灰厂劳资双方，热烈响应抗美援朝总会的号召，踊跃参加了捐献飞机大炮运动。不少职工要求每月献工一天，到年底捐献三亿六千万元；另外，职工们还捐献了现款一亿余元。工厂的资方（包括启新洋灰公司天津总公司）也决定捐献战斗机三架和高射炮一门。在捐献运动中，全厂职工为支持资方的爱国行动，提出要“坚持爱国主义劳动竞赛”，资方也提出“努力改善经营管理”。在此基础上，中共启新洋灰厂工厂党委会向该厂提出了将下半年生产计划提高百分之二十九的建议。这一建议已为该厂的资方采纳，并获得工会的积极支持。全厂职工正结合检查、修订爱国公约运动，为实现这一计划而努力。
    河北省石家庄市私营天兴铸锅厂修订了爱国公约，订出了下半年的增产捐献计划。劳资双方协议：六个月增产铁锅十五吨，节省焦炭八千斤。资方至少捐献超额利润四百三十八万元；职工捐献奖金一百三十一万四千元。天兴铸锅厂劳资双方在抗美援朝运动中，曾订立爱国公约，并根据爱国公约成立了劳资协商会议，从五月二十八日起展开了爱国主义劳动竞赛。在竞赛期间，超额生产大锅八百八十六斤半，小锅三千二百三十五斤四两，节省了焦炭二千九百七十五点五斤。共获超额利润三百零七万五千五百六十元。七月中旬，劳资双方结合六月份劳动竞赛，检查了前次订的爱国公约，订出了下半年的增产捐献计划。该厂原来计划全年生产二百六十吨铁锅，前半年已生产了一百一十吨，下半年还有一百五十吨。全厂职工为了要多生产多捐献，决定每日除保证完成定额二千八百斤铁锅生产外，还要增产铁锅二百五十斤，并节省焦炭六十五斤。计算在六个月内，能超额生产铁锅十五吨，节省焦炭八千斤。以每斤铁锅平均利润四百二十元、焦炭每斤二百五十元计算，可增加收入一千四百六十万元。此项增加的收入，以百分之十作为工人的福利金，百分之三十为奖励金，厂方可得超额利润八百七十六万元，资方提出至少以百分之五十（四百三十八万元）捐献飞机大炮，职工则提出捐献所得超额奖金的百分之三十（一百三十一万四千元）为购买“石家庄工人号”飞机之用。在计划中，工人们提出了改进技术、提高生产的具体办法；资方也提出：保证开展销路，供给原料，并改善工人伙食和卫生条件，以保障工人的健康。劳资双方并根据此一计划，修订了爱国公约。规定自七月十九日起实行，每半月检查一次。
