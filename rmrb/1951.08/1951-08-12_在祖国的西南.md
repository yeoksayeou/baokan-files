	In the Southwest of the Motherland
	Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Representatives Ji Bingqian, Li Weiying, Zhang Fu
	In two and a half months, we passed through more than sixty cities in the four provinces of Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, and Guizhou, traveled more than 20,000 li, and contacted more than four million people (including more than one hundred fraternal ethnic groups). Every inch of land we passed through and every person we met left a deep impression on us.
	On the highway from Chengdu to Mianyang, it was crowded with chicken carts and large carts carrying grain everywhere. On both sides of the road were the most fertile black soil fields, full of lush green rice seedlings. Each mu of land here yields more than 1,000 jin of rice. After rent reduction and deposit refunds, the farmers' enthusiasm for production is particularly high. Yongfeng Township in Guanghan County originally harvested three dou per mu, now increased to nine dou, and they plan to increase it by another two dou next year.
	In southern Sichuan, we specially visited the salt wells in Zigong City. The worker brothers used machines to pump brine from the salt wells, which are more than 300 feet deep, and sent it through bamboo pipes directly to the stoves for boiling salt (part of the salt boiling here uses natural gas as fuel, just strike a match). The salt produced is all white refined salt, which can be used not only for consumption but also for refining dozens of chemical products. On the road leading to the salt field, there are very thick bamboo tubes for transporting brine. We were surprised why iron pipes were not used. According to the worker brothers, the brine will undergo chemical changes (rusting) when it passes through iron pipes. Many experts have come here and praised our ancestors who learned how to use bamboo utensils more than a thousand years ago. We are very excited to see such rich treasures in our motherland, but according to the workers, the salt-producing areas are not limited to Zigong. In Jianyang area near Chengdu, the salt reserves there are even richer.
	From Zigong to Neijiang, only more than sixty li apart, is another different place, a large sugar-producing area, with an annual output of more than 120 million kilograms, which is sold to all parts of the country. Han Commissioner of the Neijiang Special Office told us that the area of land planted with sugarcane has increased this year. At the same time, due to the wide sales of sugar and the increase in sugar prices, the lives of sugarcane farmers have also improved.
	We think that there is no place richer than Sichuan. Before going to Guizhou, we always thought that Guizhou was a relatively poor area in the country. In the past, some people said that Guizhou was: "No three feet of flat land, no three cents of silver for people." But when we arrived in Guizhou, the first impression we got was that the roads were particularly flat, and the car could travel 40 kilometers per hour. It takes only two days to reach Guiyang from Chongqing by car. There are many primitive forests in the south and northwest of Guizhou Province, all of which are large trees that one or two people cannot hug.
	In Huangping, we also visited a village after the land reform (Wuliqiao Village). This day happened to be the Dragon Boat Festival, and we walked into the house of a hired peasant named Pan. His whole family was eating breakfast. In the past, May was the time to go out to beg for food. Today, they are eating rice and made a chicken for the festival. He excitedly told us: "In the past, we were poor here. The Kuomintang reactionaries and landlords forced us to have no food to eat. Now Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have given us houses and land, and we can eat rice today."
	In Guizhou, the province is very rich in minerals. It has the largest reserves of aluminum that can be used to make aircraft materials in the country, and there are many tungsten, iron, and anthracite coal. Recently, many new mines have been discovered. For example, on the mountain north of Zunyi, a kind of stone has been found, which is as hard as steel and can withstand high heat. Because there are many mountains in Guizhou, there are also many minerals. At the same time, there is also a lot of power here. Many places can use hydropower to generate electricity. There is a world-famous waterfall in Anshun.
	In Yunnan, the stones of Dali, the copper of Huize, the tin of Gejiu, and the gold of Jinsha River are all famous in the country. In southern Yunnan, the climate is warm, and there are many tropical plants, such as pineapple, banana, plantain, coffee, and cotton trees. There is also a quinine tree. The common people can boil water with the leaves to treat malaria. In the Pu'er area, rice can be planted twice a year. While this piece of land is transplanting seedlings, another piece is harvesting grain. One year's harvest can be eaten for five or six years. The famous Pu'er tea is all over the mountains, and the common people can go to the mountains to pick it at will in their spare time. There are countless kinds of plants in Yunnan Province. Have you heard of a kind of rhododendron? There are more than 800 kinds of rhododendrons in Yunnan. Anyone who collects plant specimens likes to go to Yunnan. There are tropical plants, temperate plants, and cold-zone plants here.
	How rich our motherland is, how lovely our motherland is. Every inch of land is worth boasting about. How happy and proud we are to grow up on such land!
	The people who grow up on this land are even more diligent and brave. In the rural areas of Sichuan, it is difficult to find a piece of wasteland. Many ridges of rice fields are also planted with corn. In addition to agricultural production, there are also many sideline productions. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the Kuomintang reactionaries failed to build for decades, has now been built by us. The Datianwan Square in Chongqing was originally a mountain, but now it has been built into a square that can accommodate more than 100,000 people. How great is the power of the working people! What surprised us the most was the people's armed forces in the Southwest, hundreds of thousands or millions of peasant self-defense forces, and tens of thousands of female self-defense members. It was the first time we saw so many female militia members in the country. In western Sichuan, we met Huang Chuanxiu, a female militia hero who captured six bandit leaders and seized two machine guns. On the border of Yunnan, we saw female joint defense members on sentry duty with Canadian pistols. In order to defend the fruits of victory and defend the land they had turned over, thousands of peasants demanded to go to Korea to join the Volunteer Army. The peasants of Sancha Township in Dayi County, western Sichuan, raised carbines and machine guns to swear to us that they would resolutely be the backing of the Volunteer Army and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to the forefront of defending peace.
	The people of the Southwest love peace very much. When the Miao women presented gifts to us, they said: "We shed tears when we think of the tragic days in the past." Resolutely defend our good days, and resolutely oppose the aggression of American imperialism. This is the angry cry of the 70 million people in the Southwest. The people of the Southwest will never forget the blood debt of American imperialism: in Kunming, American soldiers raped our sisters on the street, killed our brothers in Xinjin, Sichuan, and used ethnic minority children for target practice in Huangping County, Guizhou...
	Blood debts must be paid with blood! The people of the Southwest demanded to join the army everywhere. Wives sent their husbands to join the army, and mothers sent their sons to join the army; they loved their husbands and sons, but they loved their motherland even more. The people of all ethnic groups in the Southwest know that today's life is due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, and they love Chairman Mao even more狂热ly. Every time we went to a place and met a person, he (she) always asked Chairman Mao first, and he (she) regarded "Chairman Mao's health" as his (her) greatest happiness. The ethnic minorities in Guizhou said of the government's policies and decrees: "This is what Chairman Mao said, it is not wrong, Chairman Mao is doing things for the people." They call government workers "Chairman Mao's people," and they call the People's Liberation Army "Chairman Mao's soldiers."
	In order to love the motherland and love Chairman Mao, the 70 million people of all ethnic groups in the Southwest are closely united, like one person; and closely united with the people of the whole country, like a family. This is an incomparably strong force. How lovely our people are! From the Northwest to the Southwest, we deeply feel that every inch of our land is lovely, and every ethnic group is lovely, which makes us more determined in our will and determination to defend the motherland and defend world peace.
	When we left the Southwest with a heart of love for the people of the Southwest, the people of all ethnic groups repeatedly told us: "Take our hearts to Korea and tell them to the comrades of the Volunteer Army!" Dear compatriots, we will never fail your entrustment. We remember: The red silk flag of "Glory Belongs to the Volunteer Army" presented by all the teachers and students of Chongqing University, with a heart printed inside, with each person's name signed inside. We remember what Wang Ruofeng, a woman from Wanxian, said when she gave us the gold commemorative medal she received when she gave birth to her first child: "Protect our children." We remember: In northern Sichuan, the sixty-year-old Ms. Yin put on her reading glasses and, together with twenty-two women, spent three days and three nights embroidering portraits of Chairman Mao and General Kim Il-sung for us. We remember: the words of the military families everywhere: "Tell my good children to eliminate the American bandits for us, make more meritorious deeds and send good news home." We also remember: the worker brothers everywhere, increasing production as a gift to welcome us; the business community everywhere welcomes us with paying taxes enthusiastically. We also saw the people of the whole Southwest enthusiastically donating airplanes and artillery. We will never forget the love and precious entrustment of the people of the Southwest to the Volunteer Army. We will bring the deep feelings of the 70 million people of the Southwest who love the motherland, love Chairman Mao, and love the Volunteer Army, to the comrades on the front line in Korea. We will bring all the great achievements and firm determination of the people of the Southwest to resist US aggression and aid Korea to Korea. We will also tell every comrade about the care for the families of the Volunteer Army in various parts of the Southwest, so that everyone can eliminate the American aggressors and their accomplices more bravely without any worries, to answer the love of the people of the Southwest.

　　在祖国的西南
    中国人民志愿军归国代表  嵇炳前  李维英  张甫
    我们在两个半月的时间里，经过了四川、西康、云南、贵州四省的六十多个城市，走了两万多里路，接触了四百多万人民（其中包括了一百多种兄弟民族）。我们每走过一寸土地，见到每一个人民，总给我们留下一种深刻的印象。
    在从成都到绵阳去的公路上，到处都挤满了载运粮食的鸡公车和大车。公路两旁，尽是最肥沃的黑土田，长满了碧绿的稻秧。这里每一亩地要打一千多斤稻子，在减租退押以后，农民生产情绪特别高，广汉县永丰乡原来每亩地的收获量是三斗，现在增加到九斗，明年他们还准备再增产二斗。
    在川南，我们特地参观了自贡市盐井，工人弟兄们把卤水从三百多英尺深的盐井里用机器吸上来，通过竹管子一直送到烧盐的锅灶内去熬盐（这里熬盐有一部分是利用天然的瓦斯做燃料，只要擦一根火柴就行了）。熬出的盐都是洁白的精盐，除了可供食用之外，还可提炼几十种化学用品。在通往盐场周围的路上，到处都是很粗的输送卤水用的竹筒筒，我们奇怪，为什么不用铁管呢？据工人弟兄谈，卤水通过铁管就会起化学变化（生锈），很多专家来过这里，都特别赞美我们的祖先，远在一千多年前，就学会了怎样使用竹器了。我们很兴奋地看到祖国有这样丰富的宝藏，但据工人谈，产盐的地方还不止自贡，在成都附近的简阳一带，那里盐的蕴藏量还要丰富得多。
    从自贡到内江，只隔六十多里路，又是一个不同的地方，是大量的产糖区，每年产量达一万万二千多万公斤，运销国内各地。内江专署韩专员告诉我们，今年种甘蔗的土地面积更增加了，同时，由于糖的销路广，糖价提高，蔗农的生活也改善了。
    我们想，再没有比四川更富有的地方了。在到贵州以前，我们总认为贵州是全国比较穷的地区。过去有人说贵州是：“地无三尺平，人无三分银。”但是到了贵州，首先给我们的印象，是公路修的特别平坦，汽车一小时可走四十公里，由重庆到贵阳，坐汽车两天就可到达。贵州省南部和西北部，有很多原始森林，都是一两个人抱不过来的大树。
    我们在黄平还参观了一个土地改革后的村子（五里桥寨）。这天正是端午节，我们走到一个姓潘的雇农家里，他们全家正在吃早饭。往年在五月间正是出外讨荒的时候，今天，他们却正在吃大米饭，还做了一只鸡子过节。他激动地告诉我们：“以前我们这里是穷，国民党反动派和地主逼得我们没有饭吃，现在毛主席共产党给我们分了房子分了地，我们今天能吃上大米饭了。”
    在贵州，全省的矿产非常丰富，有全国埋藏量最多的可制飞机原料的铝，有很多钨、铁，还有无烟煤。最近，又发现了很多新的矿。例如，在遵义以北的山上，发现有一种石头，坚硬如钢，能耐高热。正因为贵州山多，矿产也就多，同时，这里还有很大的动力，很多地方可以用水力来发电，在安顺有世界驰名的大瀑布。
    在云南，大理的石，会泽的铜，个旧的锡，金沙江的金子，那是全国有名的。在云南的南部，气候温暖，有很多的热带植物，例如菠萝、香蕉、芭蕉、咖啡、棉花树等，还有一种奎宁树，老百姓用树叶子熬水就可以治疟疾。在普洱区，一年可以种两次稻谷，这块田插秧，另一块正在收谷子，一年的收成可以吃五、六年。有名的普洱茶，满山都是，老百姓在空闲的时候，随意到山里去采。云南全省各种植物是数不清的，你听说有一种杜鹃花么？在云南杜鹃花就有八百多种，凡是收集植物标本的人都喜欢到云南。这里有热带植物、温带植物、还有寒带植物。
    我们的祖国是多么的丰富，我们的祖国是多么的可爱。每一寸土地都值得我们夸耀，我们生长在这样的土地上，是多么幸福和骄傲！
    生长在这土地上的人民更是勤劳勇敢的，在四川的农村中，很难找出一块荒废的土地，很多稻田的埂埂上，还种上了苞谷，农业生产以外还加上很多副业生产。几十年来国民党反动派没有修成的成渝铁路，我们现在已经修筑了。重庆的大田湾广场，原来是一座山，现在已修成了能容十多万人的广场。劳动人民的力量是多么伟大呀！最使得我们惊奇的，是西南的人民武装，几十万几百万的农民自卫队，还有成千成万女自卫队员，我们在全国还是第一次看到这样多的女民兵。在川西，我们会见了一个人抓了六个匪首、缴了两挺机枪的女民兵英雄黄传秀。在云南的边疆上，我们又看到带着加拿大手枪站哨的女联防队员。为了保卫胜利果实，保卫翻身土地，成千成万的农民要求到朝鲜去参加志愿军。川西大邑县三岔乡农民向我们举起卡宾枪、机关枪宣誓，坚决做志愿军的后盾，随时准备响应祖国的号召，走上保卫和平的最前线。
    西南人民是酷爱和平的，苗胞妇女在向我们献礼的时候说：“一想到过去悲惨的日子，我们就掉泪。”坚决保卫我们的好日子，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略，这是全西南七千万人民愤怒的呼声。西南人民永远忘不了美帝国主义的血债：在昆明，美军曾在大街上强奸过我们的姊妹，在四川的新津杀死过我们的兄弟，在贵州的黄平县拿少数民族的小娃娃来打靶……。
    血债要用血来还！西南人民到处要求参军。妻子送丈夫去参军，母亲送儿子去参军；她们爱自己的丈夫和儿子，可是，她们更爱祖国。西南各族人民知道今天的日子是由于毛主席英明领导得来的，他们更狂热的爱护毛主席。我们每到一个地方，每碰见一个人，他（她）们总是先问毛主席，他（她）把“毛主席健康”作为自己的最大的快乐。贵州少数民族对政府的政策法令，都说：“这是毛主席说的话，没有错的，毛主席是给人民办事的。”他们把政府工作人员称为“毛主席的人”，他们称解放军是“毛主席的战士”。
    为了爱祖国，为了爱毛主席，西南各民族七千多万人民紧紧团结在一起，像一个人；和全国人民紧紧团结在一起，像一家人。这是无比坚强的力量。我们的人民是多么可爱啊！我们从西北到西南来，使我们深切地感到，我们每一寸土地都是可爱的，每一族人民都是可爱的，这样就使我们更加坚定了我们保卫祖国和保卫世界和平的意志与决心。
    当我们抱着一颗热爱西南人民的心离开西南的时候，各族人民都是再三的嘱咐我们：“把我们的心带到朝鲜去，告诉给志愿军的同志们！”亲爱的同胞们，我们决不辜负你们的嘱咐。我们记得：重庆大学全体师生献的一幅“光荣属于志愿军”的大红绸旗，里面印着一颗心，心内签着每个人的名字。我们记得万县妇女王若峰把生第一个孩子时的金质纪念章送给我们的时候所说的话：“保卫我们的孩子。”我们记得：在川北，六十多岁的尹老太太戴上老花眼镜和二十二位妇女，花了三天三夜，为我们绣制毛主席和金日成将军的像。我们记得：各地军属们讲的话：“告诉我的好孩子，给我们狠狠地消灭美国强盗，多立功寄喜报回家来。”我们更记得：各地工人弟兄，以增加生产作为欢迎我们的献礼；各地工商界以踊跃纳税欢迎我们。我们更看到全西南人民热烈地捐献飞机和大炮。我们决不忘记西南人民对志愿军的热爱和珍贵的嘱咐，我们要把西南七千万人民热爱祖国，热爱毛主席，热爱志愿军的深厚的感情，全部的带给朝鲜前线的同志们，我们要把西南人民抗美援朝的伟大成就和坚强的决心全部带到朝鲜去，我们更要把西南各地的对志愿军家属的照顾告诉每一个同志，使大家毫无顾虑地更勇敢地消灭美国侵略者及其帮凶们，来回答西南人民的热爱。
