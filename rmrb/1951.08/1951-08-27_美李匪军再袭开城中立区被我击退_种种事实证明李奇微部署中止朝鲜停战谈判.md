　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 26th: Our special correspondent reports: After Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai sent a protest letter to Ridgway at 23:00 on the 23rd regarding the bombing of the Kaesong meeting site by U.S. aircraft, our side did not receive Ridgway's reply until 11:00 am on the 25th. This arrogant and unreasonable reply was delivered to our liaison officer at Panmunjom by a liaison officer from the Syngman Rhee army named Li Shurong. In the past, the U.S. side sent American liaison officers to contact our side regarding negotiation matters and deliver documents, but this time they sent a liaison officer from the Syngman Rhee army, which is noteworthy. Secondly, the other side's liaison officer brought a group of reporters with him, busy taking pictures. Bringing so many reporters to deliver a letter is also a first, which is also noteworthy.
　　Following the intrusion of U.S. and Li gangster troops into the Panmunjom neutral zone on the 19th of this month, where they killed our platoon leader Yao Qingxiang, on the morning of the 25th, another 21 armed personnel in plainclothes from the U.S. and Li gangster troops, carrying automatic rifles and carbines, invaded Baitianli near Panmunjom, again attempting to kill our military police patrol personnel. Fortunately, they were discovered by our side and retaliated against. The U.S. and Li gangster troops in plainclothes immediately fled to the southeast. On the afternoon of the 25th, seven U.S. aircraft successively intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone twice, flying from northwest to southeast.
　　Yesterday, fierce bombing sounds from the Ryesong River direction and shelling sounds from U.S. and Li gangster warships could be clearly heard in Kaesong. According to a large number of refugees who fled from southeast of Panmunjom to Kaesong, the U.S. and Li gangster troops have recently been looting grain and capturing young men everywhere in the occupied areas of Changdan County and Kaepung County, and clamoring to "enter Kaesong in five days."
　　Observing the above facts in connection with Ridgway's arrogant and unreasonable reply, it can be seen that Ridgway has made arrangements to suspend the Korean armistice talks.

　　美李匪军再袭开城中立区被我击退
    种种事实证明李奇微部署中止朝鲜停战谈判
    【新华社开城二十六日电】本社特派记者报道：金日成、彭德怀两将军于二十三日二十三时发出对美机轰炸开城会址地区事件给李奇微的抗议信后，我方于二十五日上午十一时始收到李奇微的复信。这封蛮横无理的复信，是由李承晚军的一个名叫李树荣的联络官在板门店送给我方联络官的。过去，美方对于与我方接洽有关谈判事宜与递送文件时均派美籍联络官，而此次则派了李承晚军的联络官来，这是值得玩味的。其次，对方联络官来时，还带来了一批记者，忙着摄取照片。递送信件跟来这么多记者，也是头一次，这又是值得玩味的。
    继本月十九日美、李匪军侵入板门店中立区杀害我姚庆祥排长之后，二十五日晨，又有美、李匪军便衣武装人员二十一人携带自动步枪、卡宾枪，侵入我板门店附近的白田里，再次图谋杀害我方军事警察巡逻人员。幸被我方发现，予以回击。美、李匪军便衣武装人员旋即向东南逃去。二十五日午后，先后又有美机七架，两度侵入开城中立区上空，由西北向东南飞去。
    昨日开城可以清晰地听到从礼成江方向传来的猛烈的轰炸声和从美、李匪军舰艇上发出的炮击声。据从板门店东南逃来开城的大批难民告记者称：美、李匪军最近在长湍县和开丰县占领区到处抢劫粮食和抓捕壮丁，并扬言“五天要打进开城”。
    以上种种事实与李奇微蛮横无理的复信联系起来观察，可知李奇微已经作了中止朝鲜停战谈判的部署。
