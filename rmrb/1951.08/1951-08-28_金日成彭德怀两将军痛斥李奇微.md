Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 27th:

The U.S. Side Spits Blood and Tries to Escape Responsibility for Murdering Our Delegation

Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai Sternly Condemn Ridgway

Reiterate that the U.S. Side Must Seriously Address This Provocative Incident for Negotiations to Continue

Demand Ridgway Send Liaison Officers to Kaesong for Re-Investigation and Publish the Full Text of Bilateral Correspondence

The full text of the reply from General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to Ridgway's letter of the 25th is as follows:

General Ridgway:

Your letter of August 25th has been received.

In this letter, you not only deny the serious provocative act of your aircraft illegally intruding into the neutral zone of Kaesong on the night of August 22nd, targeting the residence of our delegation for bombing and strafing, and unreasonably refuse to deal with this incident in a serious and responsible manner; but you also spit blood and slanderously accuse our side of "fabricating" this incident in an attempt to escape the serious responsibility that your side should bear for this incident. We are completely dissatisfied with your reply.

Since the beginning of the Kaesong armistice negotiations, our side has consistently adopted a serious and responsible attitude and the principle of equal treatment to handle any incident arising from violations and breaches of the Kaesong neutral zone agreement by either your side or our side, in order to facilitate the progress of the armistice negotiations. The entire record of such issues in the Kaesong negotiations irrefutably proves this. Furthermore, we have published the full text of the bilateral correspondence on such issues, in order to allow the people to understand the full picture and truth of the incidents. And what about your side? Regarding such issues, any violations and breaches of the Kaesong neutral zone agreement that belong to your side, after our side brought them to your attention or protested to your side, you either denied them or failed to address them. Even after the incident on August 19th, when your armed personnel illegally entered the Kaesong neutral zone and attacked our military police, although liaison officers from both sides conducted an on-site investigation and confirmed from local residents that this was an ambush by South Korean troops wearing military uniforms who had intruded, your chief delegate, General Joy, still denied it, saying that this was the "automatic" behavior of so-called "citizens of the Republic of Korea" in our area, for which your side was not responsible; and in your reply, you even said that this was a "malicious lie completely without factual basis." Have you not seen the fact of the ambush mentioned by General Joy in his reply to General Nam Il on August 23rd? May I ask: can South Korean troops be excluded from the United Nations forces? What is the responsibility of General Paik Sun-yup, the South Korean representative in the United Nations Command delegation? What is the essential difference between the so-called "citizens of the Republic of Korea" wearing military uniforms, taking up arms, and intruding into the neutral zone, and the South Korean troops? If the United Nations Command cannot control and is not responsible for these South Korean troops, then how can your delegation represent all the armed forces under the United Nations Command to conduct armistice negotiations?

Your attitude of distorting facts, denying everything, reversing right and wrong, and contradicting yourself is manifested in the events of the night of August 22nd, and has reached the point of perfection. Your reply, first of all, slanderously accuses our side of "fabricating" this incident, "which is not even worth a reply in itself." Your arbitrary attitude is enough to prove that this incident was premeditated by your side, so you have adopted the method of denying everything and spitting blood to escape the serious responsibility that you cannot deny in the face of ironclad facts. No wonder your liaison officer initially made excuses not to come to Kaesong for investigation when he first heard of the incident, and later, when he arrived at the scene, he said that such explosion marks and shrapnel were not worth looking at, and claimed that it was inconvenient to investigate at night and that he would come again for re-investigation during the day, but by the daytime of August 23rd, your chief delegate, General Joy, had already impatiently rushed to publish a report denying everything and accusing us of "fabrication," while your liaison officer did not come again for re-investigation, but repeatedly said that our side refused re-investigation. All this is because your side had this premeditation, so after the incident occurred, you were eager to get rid of and deny this responsibility, and did not dare to face reality, is it not obvious?

Facts speak louder than words. Regarding the bombing and strafing by your aircraft intruding into the Kaesong neutral zone on the night of August 22nd, although you disregarded the facts in your reply and said it was a "malicious lie completely without factual basis," the fragments of the bombs dropped by your aircraft, the craters they created, the cracks in the rocks they shattered, and the scorched areas are still preserved in their original state near the residence of our delegation in the Kaesong meeting area, and the residents of the Kaesong area can also testify to the real situation of the bombing and strafing by your aircraft that night. Unless you are determined to break the negotiations and prevent your delegation, liaison officers, and even journalists from coming to Kaesong again, can your side escape this examination of reality? As for our side, we neither refused your side to come again for re-investigation during the day on the night of August 22nd, nor do we still expect your side to come for re-investigation. As long as you come into contact with the actual scene of the bombed area in Kaesong, you can see who is the maker of this provocative incident, and who issues absurd and ridiculous lies without relying on facts.

Not only that, even based on the report by your General Joy, which has already been published, regarding the distortion of facts by your liaison officer, your side cannot deny the fact that the bomb fragments and bombing traces that your liaison officer saw with his own eyes were caused by aircraft bombing, and the radar reconnaissance report of your Fifth Air Force proves that there was an aircraft west of Kaesong at 21:30 on August 22nd. Of course, it is not easy to identify the aircraft detected by radar, but on what basis did your General Joy and liaison officer arbitrarily say that it was not a United Nations aircraft, but our aircraft murdering our own delegation? This kind of denial and slander has reached such an astonishing and ridiculous level. In your reply, in addition to repeating their opinions, you also deny that other incidents, if not "manufactured" by our side, are also "actions by irregular forces with which you have no open or secret connection whatsoever," but can you deny that the South Korean troops in the August 19th incident, if not directly related to the United Nations Command, are openly or secretly related to the South Korean military command? Can you say that the aircraft on the night of August 22nd were also irregular South Korean aircraft?

Your side's attitude of distorting facts, denying everything, reversing right and wrong, and contradicting yourself regarding the undeniable provocative act of the United Nations aircraft illegally intruding into the Kaesong neutral zone to carry out bombing and strafing makes it difficult for people not to suspect that your side's purpose is to create incidents, sabotage negotiations, and not bear the responsibility for the breakdown of negotiations, but this responsibility will not fall on our side, because our side has always taken a realistic, fair and reasonable attitude to ensure the progress of the armistice negotiations. Only when your military aircraft destroyed the neutral zone and targeted our delegation for murder did our delegation be forced to announce a suspension of the meeting, pending your side's responsible handling of this incident.

We now once again propose to you: your side must seriously and responsibly handle this serious provocative incident, and then the armistice negotiations can be guaranteed and continue to seek a fair and reasonable armistice agreement. At the same time, we request you to order your liaison officer to come to the Kaesong area immediately to conduct a re-investigation with our liaison officer on the incident that occurred on the night of August 22nd when your military aircraft bombed near the residence of our delegation, in order to prove once again the complete truth of our protest.

In order to enable the people of the world to understand the full picture and truth of the incident, we ask you to publish the full text of the correspondence between you and us, as we have done, and allow your various news agencies to send it out in full and newspapers everywhere to publish it in full.

We await your reply.

Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army

Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers

### 金日成彭德怀两将军痛斥李奇微

　　美方含血喷人图逃脱谋杀我代表团罪责
    金日成彭德怀两将军痛斥李奇微
    再次指出美方必须认真处理这一挑衅事件谈判才能继续
    要李奇微派联络官来开城复查并发表双方往来文电全文
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军对李奇微二十五日回信的答复，全文如下：李奇微将军：
    你八月二十五日的回信收到了。
    在这封信上，你不仅抵赖八月二十二日夜你方飞机非法侵入开城中立区上空，以我方代表团住所为目标，施行轰炸和扫射的严重挑衅行为，并无理拒绝对于此次事件作认真负责的处理；而且还含血喷人，诬称此次事件为我方所“制造”，以图逃脱你方对于此次事件所应负的严重责任。我们对于你这个答复，是完全不能认为满意的。
    自从开城停战谈判开始以来，我方就一直采取认真负责的态度和平等对待的原则，去处理你我双方中任何一方因违反和破坏开城中立区协议而产生的事件以利停战谈判的进行。在开城谈判中关于这类问题的全部记录，不可动摇地证明了这一点。并且关于这类问题的双方来往文电，我方都曾全文发表，为的是让人民明了事件的全貌和真相。而你们方面呢？凡是关于这类问题，其违反和破坏开城中立区协议的行为属于你方者，经我方提请你方注意或向你方提出抗议，你方不是予以否认，就是不予处理，甚至在八月十九日你方武装人员非法进入开城中立区袭击我方军事警察事件发生后，虽经双方联络官到现场调查，并从当地居民中证实了这是穿着军衣的南朝鲜部队侵入进来的伏击，但你方首席代表乔埃将军尚抵赖说，这是所谓“大韩民国公民”在我方地区内的“自动”行为，你方不负责任；而你在这次回信中竟说这是“完全没有事实根据的恶毒谎言”。难道你没有看到乔埃将军在八月二十三日给我方南日将军复信中提到的伏击事实么？试问：南朝鲜部队可以从联合国军队中除外么？联合国军代表团中南朝鲜代表白善烨将军的责任何在？穿着军衣、拿起武器、侵入中立区的所谓“大韩民国公民”的队伍与南朝鲜部队有何本质上的不同？如果联合国军司令部对于这些南朝鲜部队竟无法控制和不负责任，那么，你方代表团何以能代表包括他们在内的一切联合国军所属的武装力量来进行停战谈判呢？
    你方这种歪曲事实、抵赖一切、颠倒是非和自相矛盾的态度，表现在八月二十二日夜间的事件上，更发展到登峰造极的程度。你的复信，首先就诬蔑这次事件是我方“制造的，其本身就不值一复”。你这种武断态度正足以证明这次事件是你方的预谋，所以采取抵赖一切，含血喷人的办法，来逃避在铁的事实面前你方无可抵赖的严重责任。无怪你方联络官在开始听到发生这次事件时，即先托辞不肯前来开城调查，后来到了现场，又表示这样的爆炸痕迹和弹片不值得一看，并诿称黑夜不便调查，等到白天再来复查，可是到了八月二十三日白天你方首席代表乔埃将军已迫不及待地抢先发表了抵赖一切、诬我“捏造”的报告，而你方联络官却并不再来复查，反而再三说是我方拒绝复查。这一切，都是由于你方有此预谋，所以在事件发生后才急于摆脱和抵赖这个责任，而不敢面对现实，难道还不明显么？
    事实胜于雄辩，八月二十二日夜间你方飞机侵入开城中立区的轰炸和扫射，尽管你在复信中不顾事实地说它是“完全没有事实根据的恶毒谎言”，但是你方飞机投下的炸弹碎片及其炸成的土坑，炸破的岩石裂痕，烧焦的地方都还在开城会址区我方代表团住所附近原状未动地保存着，开城地区的居民也能证明当夜你方飞机轰炸和扫射的真实情况，除非你方决心破裂谈判，不让你方代表团、联络官乃至新闻记者再来开城，否则，你方能够逃避这个现实的审查么？至于我们方面，在八月二十二日夜间既未拒绝你方白天再来复查，现在也仍然期待你方前来复查。只要接触到开城被炸地区的现场实际，就可看出：谁是这次挑衅事件的制造者，谁不根据事实而武断地发出荒谬绝伦的谎言。
    不仅如此，即就你方乔埃将军所已发表的你方联络官歪曲事实的报告来说，你方也不能否认你方联络官所亲眼看见的炸弹碎片和被炸痕迹是飞机轰炸造成的这个事实，而你方第五航空队雷达侦察的报告却正好证明八月二十二日二十一时三十分在开城以西有过一架飞机出现。当然，雷达侦察出的飞机是不易识别的，但你方乔埃将军和联络官有何根据武断地说它不是联合国军的飞机，而是我方的飞机谋杀自己的代表团呢？这种抵赖和诬蔑，竟达到如此惊人而又荒谬可笑的程度。在你的复信中，除了重复他们的意见外，你也抵赖其他事件如果不是我方“制造”，也是与你方“没有一丝一毫公开的或秘密的关系的非正规队伍的行动”，但你能否认八月十九日事件中的南朝鲜部队如果不是与联合国军司令部直接发生关系，也是与南朝鲜军司令部发生公开的或秘密的关系么？你能说八月二十二日夜间的飞机也是南朝鲜的非正规飞机么？
    你方此次对于联合国军飞机非法侵入开城中立区施行轰炸和扫射之无可抵赖的挑衅行为，竟采取如此歪曲事实、抵赖一切、颠倒是非和自相矛盾的态度，很难使人不怀疑你方的目的是在制造事件，破坏谈判而又不担负谈判破裂的责任，但是这个责任落不到我们方面，因为我们方面历来是以实事求是、公平合理的态度来保证停战谈判的进行的，只有当你方军用飞机破坏了中立区并以我方代表团为其谋杀的目标的时候，我方代表团才被迫地宣告停会，以待你方对此事件作负责的处理。
    我们现在再一次向你提出：你方必须认真负责地处理这一严重的挑衅事件，然后停战谈判才能得到保证，继续进行，以寻求公平合理停战协议。同时，我们向你要求，你应命令你方联络官即来开城地区与我方联络官对于八月二十二日夜间所发生的你方军用飞机轰炸我方代表团住所附近的事件进行一次复查，以再一次证明我们抗议的全部真实性。
    为使全世界人民能够明了事件的全貌和真相，我们要求你，能和我方一样，将你我双方来往的文电全文发表，并容许你方各新闻通讯社全文发出和各地报纸全文登载。
    我们等待你的回答。
        朝鲜人民军最高司令官  金日成
        中国人民志愿军司令员  彭德怀
              一九五一年八月二十七日
