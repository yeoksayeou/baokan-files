　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from Paris: The Plevin government, which barely came to power 55 days after the French general election, is currently facing many difficulties that must be resolved but cannot be resolved. One of them is the issue of prices and wages caused by the war preparation policy.

    As a result of the French government's frenzied war preparations, excessive currency issuance, arbitrary tax increases, reduction of peaceful industrial production, and deliberate increase in prices, the rise in prices in France since the war has been alarming. From the beginning of 1947 to July 1950, food prices rose by 100 percent, daily industrial product prices rose by 240 percent, and rents increased by 350 percent. From July 1950 to March of this year, the cost of living in France increased by 20 percent; and the price level on June 16th rose by 11.7 percent compared to March. After the French general election, prices continued to soar. According to "L'Humanité," in the first week of July alone, eggs, vegetables, etc., rose by 11 to 35 percent. According to the French General Confederation of Labor, prices in mid-July were 17 percent higher than in mid-January.

    Under such circumstances of continuously rising prices, the fruits of the strike struggles of the French working people in March and April—wage increases of 11.5 to 15 percent—had long been completely swallowed up. Currently, the real wages of the French working people are even 35 percent lower than in 1914, and only a little over 49 percent of the pre-war 1938 level. The percentage of wage income of the French working people in the national income has also decreased from 45 percent in 1938 to below 34 percent in 1950; while the percentage of profits of the big capitalists in the national income has soared from 29 percent to 50.5 percent during the same period.

    The French working people, with their glorious tradition of struggle, will never tolerate this continuous attack on their living standards. The call for stabilizing prices and raising wages is currently resounding throughout France. Therefore, the wage and price problem in France, like the financial crisis, has exhausted the French ruling clique's brains and left them at a loss. They originally placed their hope for solving the difficult problem of prices and wages on the June 17th general election. "Le Parisien Libéré" once said: "It seems that the government and parliament cannot find a way to curb prices unless they hold an early election." However, although the general election was held early, even the right-wing Socialist Party's "Le Populaire" had to admit: "In the new parliament, many economic and social difficulties will still exist." The French reactionaries, from the right-wing Socialist Party to the Gaullist elements, are all extremely terrified by this. The head of the right-wing Socialist Party, Mollet, said worriedly immediately after the election: "If the new parliament and the new government cannot cope with the real problems such as the purchasing power of workers, it will not last long." De Gaulle's "Le Pays" also lamented: "This summer we have to deal with well-known difficulties. These difficulties are: the budget deficit, rising prices, and the wage issue has delayed the rearmament."

　　法政府疯狂备战引起物价高涨
    法国工人普遍要求提高工资
    反动统治集团一致感到非常恐惧
    【新华社十三日讯】巴黎消息：在法国大选后五十五天才勉强上台的普利文政府，目前要碰到许多必须解决而无法解决的困难。其中之一，就是备战政策所引起的关于物价与工资的问题。
    由于法国政府要疯狂备战而滥发通货、任意增税、削减和平工业生产和故意提高物价的结果，战后以来法国物价上涨的情形是惊人的。从一九四七年初到一九五○年七月，食物价格上涨了百分之百，日用工业品价格上涨了百分之二百四十，房租则提高了百分之三百五十。从一九五○年七月到今年三月，法国生活费用增加了百分之二十；而六月十六日的物价又比三月份上涨了百分之十一点七。在法国大选后，物价仍然继续猛涨。据《人道报》报道，仅在七月的第一周，鸡蛋、菜蔬等就涨价百分之十一至百分之三十五不等。据法国总工会估计，七月中旬的物价已比一月中上涨了百分之十七。
    在这种物价不断高涨的情形下，今年三、四月间法国劳动人民罢工斗争的果实——工资增加百分之十一点五至十五，就早已被吞没得干干净净。目前，法国劳动人民的实际工资甚至比一九一四年还要低百分之三十五，而只有战前一九三八年的百分之四十九强。法国劳动人民的工资收入在国民收入中的百分比，也已经从一九三八年的百分之四十五降至一九五○年的百分之三十四以下；而大资本家的利润在国民收入中的百分比，在同一时期却从百分之二十九激增至百分之五十点五。
    有着光荣斗争传统的法国劳动人民是绝不会容忍这种对他们的生活水平的不断进攻的，要求平抑物价，提高工资的呼声，目前已响遍了法国。因此，法国的工资与物价问题已经和财政危机问题同样使得法国统治集团伤尽脑筋而一筹莫展。他们原来也曾把解决物价与工资这个难题的希望寄托在六月十七日的大选上，《解放了的巴黎人报》就曾说过：“似乎政府和议会都找不出抑制物价的方法来，除非提前选举。”但是，大选虽然提前举行了，结果却连右翼社会党的《人民报》都不得不承认：“在新议会中，目前许多经济与社会方面的困难还要存在。”从右翼社会党到戴高乐分子的法国反动派对此一致感到非常恐惧。右翼社会党的头子摩勒在大选刚一结束后就忧心忡忡地说：“假如新议会和新政府不能应付真正的问题如工人购买力问题的话，是不会长久的。”戴高乐的《今晨报》也悲叹道：“今年夏天要应付尽人皆知的困难。这些困难就是：预算赤字、物价上涨和工资问题延缓了整军。”
