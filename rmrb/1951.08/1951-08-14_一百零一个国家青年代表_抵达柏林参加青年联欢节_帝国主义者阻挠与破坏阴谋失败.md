Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 13th: Numerous youth representatives from various countries are continuing to overcome all difficulties to arrive in Berlin to participate in the World Youth and Student Festival for Peace. World Federation of Democratic Youth Secretary and Executive Bureau Member of the International Festival Committee, Basel, listed the numbers of representatives from various countries participating in the festival at a press conference on the 11th, explaining the scale of the festival. Basel said: There are already 22,000 youth representatives representing 101 countries who have arrived in Berlin to participate in the festival. There are another 3,000 people on their way to Berlin. Two thousand people were blocked in Austria by the US occupying forces. No matter how the governments of the American and British blocs try to prevent young people from coming to Berlin, there are still 3,000 people coming from France, 1,000 from Britain, and 60 from the United States. It is expected that another 60 American representatives will come to participate in the festival. The Italian Gasperi government prohibited Italian youth from going abroad to participate in the festival, but in response to this ban, the Italian youth expanded the original delegation of only 1,000 people and sent 1,300 people to participate in the festival.
　　The representatives of Latin American countries encountered great difficulties. But there are still 105 representatives from Brazil who have arrived in Berlin, 40 representatives from Argentina, 24 representatives from Cuba, and 28 representatives from Colombia.
　　Asian and African countries have also sent large-scale delegations to Berlin. There are 84 representatives from India, 89 representatives from Indonesia, 47 representatives from Nigeria, 119 representatives from Iran, 141 representatives from Lebanon, and many representatives from other countries.
　　Basel finally said: The reason why the festival can attract such a wide range of young people to participate and make them so enthusiastic is because the festival has the noble purpose of fighting for world peace and international friendship.

　　一百零一个国家青年代表  抵达柏林参加青年联欢节
    帝国主义者阻挠与破坏阴谋失败
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：为数众多的各国青年代表，正继续冲破一切困难到达柏林参加世界青年与学生和平联欢节。世界民主青年联盟书记、联欢节国际委员会执行局委员巴塞尔于十一日在记者招待会上列举参加联欢节的各国代表的数字，说明联欢节的规模。巴塞尔说：业已到达柏林参加联欢节的，共有代表着一百零一个国家的青年代表两万两千人。正在来柏林途中的还有三千人。在奥地利被美国占领军当局所阻的有两千人。不管美英集团的各国政府怎样企图阻止青年到柏林来，但仍然有三千人从法国来，一千人从英国来，六十人从美国来，预料还有美国代表六十人要来参加联欢节。意大利加斯贝利政府禁止意大利青年出国参加联欢节，但作为对这一禁令的答复，意大利青年扩大了原来只有一千人的代表团，派遣了一千三百人来参加联欢节。
    拉丁美洲各国的代表们遇到了很大的困难。但是已经到了柏林的仍有巴西代表一百零五人。阿根廷代表四十人，古巴代表二十四人，哥伦比亚代表二十八人。
    亚洲和非洲各国也都派了大规模的代表团来到柏林。印度代表有八十四人，印尼代表八十九人，尼日利亚代表四十七人，伊朗代表一百一十九人，黎巴嫩代表一百四十一人，以及其他国家的代表多人。
    巴塞尔最后说：联欢节之所以能够吸引这样广大的青年参加，并使他们情绪这样热烈，就是因为联欢节具有为世界和平及国际友好而斗争的崇高的目的。
