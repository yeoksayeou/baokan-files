　　To the Editor:
　　Regarding the matter of a certain barber in our county forcing other barbers to organize a joint operation, as published in the People's Daily on June 20th, we hereby report the following situation:
　　Yu Chunshan, the director of the fifth village peasant association in Huayuan Town, the first district of our county, was originally a barber. In early December 1950, he initiated the organization of a barber cooperative. When some barbers were unwilling to join, he used his position as director of the peasant association to threaten them into joining. He also enjoyed a portion of the wages earned by the workers. In March 1951, the industry and commerce section of our county and the local district people's government discovered that this cooperative was an unreasonable organization and immediately notified them to dissolve it. Yu Chunshan was also removed from the peasant association. After that, the original workers of this cooperative reorganized themselves and established a joint barber association. The workers also newly elected a director of the joint association. This June, because business was poor, the joint association dissolved itself. Yu Chunshan was able to threaten barbers into setting up a cooperative and collecting a portion of their wages because we failed to deal with it promptly, for which we should be held responsible.

　　永绥县花垣镇强迫组织的理发合作社已解散了
    编辑同志：
    六月二十日人民日报刊载我县某地理发工人强迫其他理发工人组织联营一事，现将此事经过情况报告如下：
    我县第一区花垣镇第五村农会主任喻春山原系理发工人，他在一九五○年十二月上旬发起组织理发工人合作社，一部分理发工人不愿参加，他就凭借农会主任之职权威胁他们参加。自己并坐享工人所得工钱的一部分。一九五一年三月我县工商科及当地区人民政府发现这个合作社是一个不合理的组织，当时就通知他们撤销了。喻春山也被清出了农会。此后，这个合作社原有的工人们就自行改组成立理发联营社。工人们并新选了联营社主任。今年六月因为联营社生意不好，联营社也就自行解散了。喻春山得以威胁理发工人搞起合作社，并坐收工人的一部分工资，我们未能及时处理，这是我们应负责任的。
