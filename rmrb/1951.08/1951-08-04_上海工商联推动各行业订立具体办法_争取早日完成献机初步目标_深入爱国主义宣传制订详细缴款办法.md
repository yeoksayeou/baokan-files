The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce Promotes the Formulation of Specific Methods in Various Industries
    Strive for Early Completion of the Preliminary Goal of Donating Aircraft
    Deepens Patriotic Propaganda and Formulates Detailed Payment Methods

    [Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, in order to actively promote the formulation of specific methods for patriotic donations in various industries and strive for the early completion of the preliminary goal of donating 270 aircraft, held a second enlarged joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members on July 27th. The meeting passed a resolution to establish the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles' Resist-US, Aid-Korea Branch, and after heated discussions, unanimously approved the "Measures for Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles on How to Complete the Preliminary Goal of Donating 270 Aircraft."

    The measures first pointed out that some industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai have developed two main deviations in the donation movement: First, they excessively emphasize the spontaneity and voluntariness of the donation movement and regard increased production and economization as the sole source of donations; second, they view donations as an assigned task, neglecting the essence of Resist-US, Aid-Korea. The measures, addressing these two deviations, pointed out: The so-called spontaneity and voluntariness must be built on the basis of understanding the spirit of the new patriotism. The attitude of using spontaneity and voluntariness as a slogan to evade one's due responsibilities without this understanding should be criticized and corrected. At the same time, it was explained that increased production and economization are only one of the specific methods of donation, and this method can further improve production and consolidate the foundation for financial and economic construction. However, this is by no means the only method of donation. The industrial and commercial circles should also donate by contributing a part or all of their surplus and by donating a portion of their original sufficient capital. As for regarding donations as an assigned task, it would treat this movement like the previous apportioned donations, which would have very serious political consequences and must be corrected.

    Therefore, the measures put forward several points that must be paid attention to in doing a good job in donation work:

    (1) To more deeply and widely publicize the significance of Resist-US, Aid-Korea, thereby raising political awareness and promoting the spirit of patriotism.

    (2) Donations must adhere to the principle of combining increased production and economization, and must be contributed from a part or all of the surplus, and donations from those with sufficient capital are welcome.

    (3) In formulating donation plans, it is first necessary to effectively implement the quota movement. The standard of the quota should be raised one step on the original basis according to the actual situation of each factory. Through labor-capital consultation, specific plans for fixed quantity, fixed materials, and fixed quality should be formulated and implemented effectively. The capitalists should contribute part or all of the increased income as donations. The excess profits obtained beyond the quota standard should also be discussed with labor and capital to determine the amount of donation, and part of the profits should be used to provide welfare for employees, while establishing a reward system to encourage production and clearly establish the idea of relying on the working class to ensure the completion of the plan.

    (4) Payment methods should be formulated. All industries should formulate detailed payment plans to facilitate the bank's arrangement of collection work. Each industry should make payments at least once a month, and although the amount of each payment does not have to be rigidly stipulated, it should not be crowded at the end of the period to avoid affecting capital turnover and price fluctuations.

　　上海工商联推动各行业订立具体办法
    争取早日完成献机初步目标
    深入爱国主义宣传制订详细缴款办法
    【本报讯】上海市工商业联合会为了积极推动各行各业订出爱国捐献的具体办法，争取早日完成捐献二百七十架飞机的初步目标，于七月二十七日举行第二次执监委员扩大联席会议。会上通过了成立上海市工商界抗美援朝支会的议案，并在热烈讨论后，一致通过《上海市工商界如何完成捐献二百七十架飞机的初步目标办法》。
    该办法首先指出上海市有部分工商业者，在捐献运动中发生了两种主要偏向：一、过分强调了捐献运动的自发自愿性，和单纯地以增产节约所得作为捐献；二、把捐献看作一项分配任务的工作，忽视了抗美援朝的本质。该办法针对这两种偏向指出：所谓自发自愿必须建筑在对新爱国主义精神的认识基础上，没有这一认识，而用自发自愿作为口号来规避自己应尽的责任的态度，应予以批评和纠正。同时，并说明增产节约只是捐献具体办法之一，通过这一办法，能使生产提高一步，能使财经建设发展的基础更加巩固；但这决不是唯一的捐献办法，工商界还要用自盈余中提出一部分或全部，和原有足够资力的捐出一部分的办法来捐献。至于把捐献看作分配任务，就会把这一运动，看作如同过去的摊派捐款，对于政治上所生的影响是十分严重的，也必须纠正。
    因此，该办法提出了做好捐献工作必须注意的几点：
    （一）更深入地广泛地宣传抗美援朝的意义，从而提高政治认识，发扬爱国主义精神。
    （二）捐献须掌握结合增产节约的原则，必须从盈余中提出一部或全部和欢迎有足够资力者捐献。
    （三）制订捐献计划，首先要切实推行定额运动。定额的标准应根据各厂实际情况，在原有的基础上提高一步，通过劳资协商，从而订立定量定料定质的具体计划，切实执行。增加的收入，资方应提出一部或全部作为捐献。超过定额标准所得的超额利润，亦应通过劳资协商，提出捐献数额，并得以利润的一部分为职工办福利工作，同时建立奖励制度，以鼓励生产，明确树立依靠工人阶级的思想以保证计划的完成。
    （四）应该订出缴款办法。各行各业，应将缴款计划详细订出，以便银行安排收款工作。各业每月至少要缴款一次，每期的数额，虽然不必硬性规定，但不要挤在期末，以免影响资金周转和物价波动。（上海大公报）
