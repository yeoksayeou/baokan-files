　　Zhang Yunxi's Letter to Friends in the Peking Opera Circle
Editor's Note: Mr. Zhang Yunxi is a famous martial artist in the Peking Opera circle, deputy head of the Second Troupe of the Peking Opera Experimental Work Troupe of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera, and a member of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Youth Federation. This time, as a Chinese classical dance actor, he participated in the Chinese delegation to attend the "3rd World Youth and Students for Peace Festival" held in Berlin. This is a letter he sent to his friends in the Peking Opera circle in Beijing from Manchuria on his way abroad. Zhang Chunhua mentioned in the letter is a famous martial arts clown, and Bai Dengyun is a famous drummer. This time, he went abroad with him to participate in the performance of Chinese classical dance.

Dear Comrades:

　　Comrades Zhang Chunhua, Bai Dengyun, and I left the people's capital on July 16 and set off for Berlin. Because we were busy preparing for work, we did not have time to say goodbye to all the comrades, so I wrote this letter to bid you farewell temporarily.

　　Before leaving Beijing, we concentrated our studies in the China Youth Art Troupe. The collective life during this period was very pleasant; the care of the leaders and the love between comrades made me deeply feel the warmth of the revolutionary family. I lived with many well-known artists, and gained a lot of new knowledge in daily friendly conversations. After watching several previews before going abroad, I deeply felt that our national art has made rapid progress. It powerfully expresses the healthy and happy mood of the victorious Chinese people, and expresses the diligence, bravery, wisdom and other noble qualities of the Chinese people in various great struggles. This was the first time I heard the magnificent and激昂 melody of the "Yellow River Cantata." Various amazing performances in acrobatics are extremely rich and wonderful. These all demonstrate the great achievements of our national art and the creative spirit of the Chinese people. Although our Peking Opera is a part of national art, it has considerable achievements in art and is worth cherishing and caring for. However, compared with various new arts and folk arts, it appears politically weak and powerless. Therefore, I sincerely hope to the comrades in the Peking Opera circle: We should humbly learn from new art and folk art, and use new blood to enrich and develop our Peking Opera, so that our Peking Opera can gain new life, better reflect reality, and better play the role of patriotic education!

　　This time we are going abroad as representatives of the great Chinese people, and we feel unparalleled glory. In the old society, no matter how great the achievements of artists were in art, they had no status in society and often suffered intolerable bullying and humiliation. Today, thanks to the victory of the Chinese revolution, our artists have turned over. Not only are we respected as we should be at home, but we can also represent Chinese youth and Chinese art on the world stage and participate in international performances. This is an unprecedented honor for us! Several of us think this way: How did we get such glory? Undoubtedly, this glory was given to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. When drinking water, think of the source. We can only serve the people wholeheartedly to repay the Communist Party and the people! Repay the grace of Chairman Mao!

　　Recalling when I first joined the revolutionary camp, because my technical baggage was too heavy and my political understanding was vague, I often thought about personal interests, and my thoughts were always wavering. I lacked a clear understanding and firm belief in the cause of Peking Opera and the future of artists. Although the leaders repeatedly instructed that this was a correct direction and the future was bright. But at that time, my will was always not firm. As facts proved, the leaders' words were gradually being realized one by one, and my confused ideas were gradually corrected, as if I had awakened from a dream. I clearly realized that it is an unparalleled honor to be able to participate in the national theater! Under the cultivation of the People's Government, art can be done better and progress can be made faster. There is a bright future to move forward under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party! It is absolutely undesirable to haggle over how much personal income is (in fact, the income in the national theater is enough to maintain the living standards of ordinary people), only look at the present and not the future, so that you are unwilling to participate in the national theater, or even if you participate, you cannot work with peace of mind. The result is that you suffer. Now it seems that this idea in the past was completely wrong.

　　At the same time, because I had guild ideas, for a period of time, I regarded the national theater as just a circle for a few of us to move around in, and I was unwilling to make great efforts to expand and improve our team. I often proceeded from personal interests and was worried about gains and losses. I feel very ashamed when I think about it! This time I participated in the delegation to the overseas performance, and I felt that my artistic accomplishment was not enough, and that our strength was still very weak. We should greatly strengthen the lineup of actors in the national theater. We should welcome outstanding actor comrades to actively participate in the work of the national theater and strive to build the national theater!

　　This time to Berlin to participate in the "3rd World Youth and Students for Peace Festival", the purpose is to carry out cultural exchanges with fraternal countries, and to observe and learn from the advanced socialist country, the Soviet Union. Before departure, the leaders instructed that this trip abroad is a glorious and arduous combat mission, and the spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield should be used to complete this mission. Comrades! Please rest assured that for the glory of the motherland and for the glory of the Peking Opera circle, we guarantee that no matter what difficult conditions we encounter, we will complete this glorious and arduous combat mission with full spirit, earnestly and seriously! We hold a meeting every day after going abroad to review our lives. We always remember the instructions of the responsible comrades of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera: "When you encounter difficulties or feel tired, you should think more about the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, think about the great motherland and the people, and think about how heavy and glorious a task you are shouldering!"

　　Dear comrades! In order to strive for greater honor for the opera world, we should continuously strive for larger-scale overseas performances. As long as we do things according to the policy of serving the people, are not conservative, dare to create, humbly absorb opinions, give play to the spirit of collectivism, and combine research and experimentation, I believe that the development of Chinese opera must be colorful and everlasting! Comrades! Let us unite under the bright banner of Mao Zedong and strive forward!

### 张云溪给京剧界朋友们的一封信

　　张云溪给京剧界朋友们的一封信
    编者按：张云溪先生是京剧界的名武生，是中国戏曲研究院京剧实验工作团第二团副团长、北京市民主青年联合会委员。这次他以中国古典舞蹈演员身份，参加中国代表团，出席在柏林举行的“第三届世界青年学生和平联欢节”。这是他在出国途中，自满洲里寄给北京市京剧界朋友们的一封信。信中提到的张椿华是名武丑，白登云是名鼓师，这次和他一齐出国参加中国古典舞蹈的演出。亲爱的同志们：
    我和张椿华、白登云同志等已于七月十六日离开了人民的首都，向柏林进发了。因为忙于准备工作，不及向同志们一一辞行，特写此信向大家暂时告别。
    离开北京前，我们曾在中国青年文艺工作团集中学习。这期间的集体生活，过得非常愉快；首长们的关怀，同志间的友爱，使我深深感到革命大家庭的温暖。我和许多知名的艺术家生活在一起，在日常亲切的交谈中，增长了不少新的知识。看了几次出国前的预演，我深深感到我们民族艺术有了突飞猛进的发展，它有力地表现着胜利了的中国人民的健康、愉快的心情，表现着中国人民在各种伟大斗争中的勤劳、勇敢、智慧等高贵品质。《黄河大合唱》那种雄壮激昂的调子，我还是第一次听到。杂技中各种惊人表演，异常丰富精彩。这些，都表现了我们民族艺术的伟大成就，都表现了中国人民的创造精神。我们的京剧虽是民族艺术的一部分，在艺术上有着相当的成就，值得我们珍视与爱护，但与各种新艺术和民间艺术比较起来，就显得政治上软弱无力。因此，我向京剧界同志们诚恳地希望：我们应该虚心地向新艺术和民间艺术学习，以新的血液来充实和发展我们的京剧，使我们的京剧获得新的生命，更好地反映现实，更好地发挥爱国主义的教育作用！
    我们这次是以伟大的中国人民代表的资格出国的，我们感到无上的光荣。在旧社会里，艺术家们不管在艺术上有多大的成就，在社会上都没有地位，时常遭受难以容忍的欺凌污辱。今天，由于中国革命的胜利，我们艺人翻了身，不但在国内受到应有的尊重，而且还能够代表中国青年，代表中国艺术走上世界舞台，参加国际表演，这是我们空前未有的光荣！我们几个人都是这样想：我们怎样得到这样的光荣呢？无疑的，这光荣是共产党和毛主席给我们的，饮水思源，我们只有全心全意为人民服务来报答共产党和人民！报答毛主席的恩惠！
    回忆刚参加革命阵营时，由于我的技术包袱太重，政治认识模糊，时常在为个人利益着想，思想上总是动摇，对于京剧事业和艺人前途缺乏明确的认识和坚定的信念。虽然首长们一再指示这是一个正确的方向，前途是光明的。但是那时的我，意志总不坚定，经事实证明，首长们的话，一句一句的都在逐步实现了，我那种糊涂观念也渐渐被纠正过来了，好象从迷梦中清醒过来了。我明确地认识到：能够参加国家剧团，是无上的光荣！在人民政府的培养下，才能更好地搞好艺术，更快地进步。在中国共产党领导下前进，才有光明！斤斤计较个人的收入多少（其实在国家剧团的收入，足可以维持一般人以上的生活水平），只看现在不看将来，以致不肯参加国家剧团，或者虽然参加了却不能安心工作下去，是最要不得的，结果是自己吃亏。现在看来，过去这想法是完全错了。
    同时，由于我存在着行会观念，有一个时期，我把国家剧团看成只是我们少数几个人活动的圈子，不愿意用大力扩大和健全我们的队伍。我往往是从个人利益出发，患得患失，想起来非常惭愧！我这次参加了出国演出的代表团，才感到自己在艺术修养上还很不够，才感到我们的力量还十分单薄。我们还应该大大加强国家剧团的演员阵容，我们应该欢迎优秀的演员同志们踊跃地参加国家剧团的工作，为建设国家剧团而奋斗！
    这次到柏林参加“第三届世界青年学生和平联欢节”，目的是与兄弟国家作文化交流，并向先进的社会主义国家苏联观摩学习。在出发前，首长们指示说：这次出国是一个光荣的、艰巨的战斗任务，要以朝鲜战场上人民志愿军的精神，来完成这次的任务。同志们！请你们放心，我们为了祖国的光荣，为了京剧界的光荣，我们保证无论在任何困难条件下，一定要精神饱满地、认真严肃地，去完成这次光荣的、艰巨的战斗任务！我们出国后每天开一次会，检讨生活，我们时刻记着中国戏曲研究院负责同志的指示：“当你们遇到困难或者发生疲倦情绪的时候，更要想到共产党和毛主席，想到伟大的祖国和人民，想到你们肩负着多么沉重而光荣的任务！”
    亲爱的同志们！我们为了争取戏曲界更大的荣誉，应该接连不断地争取更大规模的出国演出，只要我们照着为人民服务的方针做去，不保守，敢创造，虚心吸取意见，发挥集体主义精神，研究与实验结合，我相信，中国戏曲的发展，一定是万紫千红，永久不衰的！同志们！我们大家团结在毛泽东光辉的旗帜下努力前进吧！
