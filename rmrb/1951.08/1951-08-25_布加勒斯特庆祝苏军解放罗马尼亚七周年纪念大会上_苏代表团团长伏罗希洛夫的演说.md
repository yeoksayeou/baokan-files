Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 23rd: TASS reports: Marshal Voroshilov, head of the Soviet government delegation, delivered a speech at the Bucharest rally celebrating the seventh anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Romania. The following is a summary:

Comrades! On this seventh anniversary of Romania's liberation from fascist enslavement, the Soviet delegation, on behalf of the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, on behalf of the Soviet people and the Soviet armed forces, and on behalf of the great Stalin himself, extends to you and all the Romanian people warm greetings and heartfelt congratulations.

Seven years ago, the Soviet army's successive brilliant victories over the fascist German bandits enabled the Romanian people, under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party, to forever break the chains of fascist dictatorship, overthrow the domestic Antonescu royalist fascist dictatorship, and gain liberation.

The Romanian working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party, maintained fraternal cooperation with the working peasants, united all progressive elements, became the leading force of the Romanian people and the creator of the new social system, and established the new Romanian People's Republic.

The Romanian people's struggle for freedom and independence and for laying the foundations of socialism was carried out under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party. In a short period, it has laid a solid foundation for socialism throughout the country, transforming Romania into a truly people's state.

The Romanian People's Republic has implemented a planned national economy system. As a result, Romania's industrial production has doubled in the past two years, greatly exceeding the highest pre-war level.

The Romanian working peasants, who, together with the working class, act as the pillars of the new state, actively support the government and the Workers' Party and strive to carry out the socialist transformation of the country.

The achievements of the Romanian people in national culture, science, and art are great. They have restored and awakened the creativity of the people, and restored valuable cultural undertakings that were neglected and trampled under the rule of the bourgeoisie and landlords.

Comrades! At the beginning of this year, the working people of the Romanian People's Republic enthusiastically began to implement the first five-year economic plan and the ten-year national electrification plan. Your republic's five-year plan is a huge plan for laying the economic foundation for socialism.

The implementation of the five-year plan in the first six months has given us reason to expect that, due to the labor enthusiasm of the Romanian working people and the development of socialist labor methods, the plan for the first year, and even the entire five-year plan, will inevitably be completed.

The friendship between our two peoples is permanent and has a long history. Seven years ago, this friendship gained a new political and social foundation. This foundation is the common struggle of our two peoples for peace, democracy, and socialism.

For fifteen years, international relations have been particularly tense. World imperialism has now become more rampant and more barbaric. This is understandable. Capitalism has entered the most difficult stage since its rise. It is in distress, in a state of nervous breakdown, trying to "climb a wall," from which Hitler rolled down and met a shameful end.

Comrades! The friendship between the Romanian people and the Soviet Union and other countries will gradually develop and grow stronger. The Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between our two countries vividly demonstrates the mutual understanding and close ties between our two countries.

These new relations, which have formed between the Soviet and Romanian peoples in the past few years, are unprecedented in history and can be said to be a new model for relations between peoples and between countries. These relations are based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, the foreign policy of Lenin-Stalin. The starting point of these principles of international relations is the recognition of the complete equality of all countries and nations, large and small. These principles are strengthened by the fraternal mutual assistance of all countries under the victorious banner of Lenin and Stalin, carrying out a common struggle for the realization of socialism and for the bright future of mankind.

The unwavering principles of proletarian internationalism stand in stark contrast to the modern bourgeois aggressive imperialism and the bestial ideas of nationalism that determine the relations between countries in the imperialist camp. The relationship between the United States and its "allies" can be compared to the relationship between a fat and arrogant master and poor and downcast servants, with the master being arrogant because of gold and power, and the servants willingly serving the master and willing to engage in any despicable behavior. The open plunder and brazen exploitation of the national wealth of the Marshallized countries by American monopoly capitalists - this is an example and result of this relationship.

The fate of Yugoslavia today is tragic. The rulers of that country sold out their extremely kind and honest people, betrayed the camp of socialism and democracy, and turned to the camp of capital and the darkest reaction. The despicable lackeys of Anglo-American imperialism—Tito, Kardelj, Ranković, and their ilk—restored the capitalist system in Yugoslavia; after gradually abolishing the democratic fruits of the Yugoslav people, the Tito clique, for the pleasure and benefit of their foreign masters, implemented a bloody fascist rule. But the Tito clique's barbaric atrocities and terror against the Yugoslav people, and their blatant betrayal of the interests and blood of the Yugoslav people - these will not last long. The people of all nationalities in Yugoslavia will find a way to end the Tito fascist regime and will find a way to liberate their suffering motherland.

Comrades! Under the current circumstances, when the unity of the proletariat and the cooperation of all socialist and democratic forces are becoming increasingly consolidated, the closer unity, friendship, and brotherhood of the Romanian People's Republic and all people's democratic countries with the Soviet Union are of paramount importance to the cause of peace and socialism. The Anglo-American imperialist bloc has embarked on the path of greatly expanding its armaments and has even taken direct aggressive actions against free peoples. This can be seen from the bloody intervention of Anglo-American aggressors and murderers in Korea. The unprecedented atrocities committed by the US-British aggressors in Korea are unparalleled in their barbarity and cruelty in history. Mr. MacArthur, Mr. Ridgway, and other shameless Anglo-American military experts, if you are so "brave" to carry out your aerial "strategies" and "tactics" against unarmed, homeless children, women, and old people in Pyongyang and other cities and villages of heroic Korea, then you are in trouble.

But the wolf-like imperialist beasts are not satisfied with this open plunder in the Far East. They spare no effort to hinder the communist construction of the Soviet Union, to undermine China's construction of a new life, and to harm the people's democratic countries. However, imperialism's endless delusions in this regard are limited by their own weak capabilities.

Under these circumstances, all peace-loving nations, especially those countries that are fighting for peace, must be as vigilant as possible in order to avoid and stop war and to defend and maintain peace. We must never forget the words of the great Lenin: "The bourgeoisie is always ready to use any barbaric means, brutal actions, and crimes to defend the dying capitalist system of enslavement." The great Stalin pointed out: "The people of all countries in the world do not want to suffer the poverty caused by the disaster of war. They are fighting with perseverance to consolidate peace and security."

A vivid example of this is the international movement calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact. The recent report issued by the World Peace Council's press office on the progress of the signature campaign for the declaration calling for the conclusion of a peace pact once again proves that the powerful movement of our time—the people of all countries around the world demanding peace, demanding the strengthening of the camp of peace-loving peoples and countries, and demanding the prevention of another world war—is invincible.

The forces of peace are growing stronger day by day. The mighty Soviet state—the bastion of peace and security for all countries—stands at the forefront of this unprecedented struggle. The people's democratic countries are firmly and sincerely defending the cause of peace.

Comrades! For seven years, the Romanian people, under the leadership of their Workers' Party, have been moving forward along the correct path of strengthening fraternal relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and have been fighting alongside us for peace and for socialism.

The Soviet delegation would like to reiterate its sincere wish that the Romanian people, government, and Workers' Party will achieve even greater victories in the work of building a socialist society and in the struggle for true peace throughout the world.

(When Voroshilov finished his speech, the audience erupted in thunderous applause that lasted for a long time. The entire audience stood up and shouted cheers for Stalin, the great friend of the Romanian people and the people of all countries around the world.)

　　布加勒斯特庆祝苏军解放罗马尼亚七周年纪念大会上
    苏代表团团长伏罗希洛夫的演说
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特二十三日讯：苏联政府代表团团长伏罗希洛夫元帅在布加勒斯特庆祝苏军解放罗马尼亚七周年纪念大会上发表演说，摘要如下：
    同志们！值此罗马尼亚解脱法西斯奴役的七周年纪念日，苏联代表团谨代表苏联政府和苏联共产党中央委员会，代表苏联人民及苏联武装部队，并代表伟大的斯大林本人，向你们及罗马尼亚全体人民热烈致敬并衷心祝贺。
    七年以前，苏联军队对法西斯德国匪帮的接二连三的光辉胜利，使罗马尼亚人民能在他们光荣的共产党的领导下，永远挣断了法西斯独裁的锁链，推翻了国内安东尼斯古的保皇法西斯独裁政权而获得解放。
    在共产党领导下的罗马尼亚工人阶级与劳动农民保持兄弟般的合作，团结了一切进步分子，成为罗马尼亚人民的领导力量和新社会制度的创建者，创立了新的罗马尼亚人民共和国。
    罗马尼亚人民争取自由和独立及奠定社会主义基础的斗争，是在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下进行的。在短短时期内，已在全国奠定了社会主义的坚固基础，把罗马尼亚变成了真正的人民国家。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国实行了国民经济计划制度。因此，罗马尼亚工业生产量在过去两年内就增加了一倍，大大地超过了战前的最高水平。
    与工人阶级一道充当新国家的支柱的罗马尼亚劳动农民，积极地支持政府和工人党，努力进行国家的社会主义改造工作。
    罗马尼亚人民在民族文化、科学和艺术方面所获得的成就是伟大的。他们恢复了，并且唤醒了人民中的创造力，并且恢复了在资产阶级和地主统治下受到忽视和践踏的宝贵文化事业。
    同志们！在今年年初，罗马尼亚人民共和国的劳动人民热情鼓舞地开始执行第一个五年经济计划和十年全国电气化计划。你们共和国的五年计划是为社会主义奠定经济基础的巨大计划。
    头六个月执行五年计划的情形已使我们有理由期望，由于罗马尼亚劳动人民的劳动热情和社会主义劳动方式的发展，第一年的计划，以至全部五年计划，都必然能够完成。
    我们两国人民间的友好是永久不变而且有着悠久的历史的。七年前这种友谊获得了新的政治与社会基础。这个基础就是我们两国人民争取和平、民主与社会主义的共同斗争。
    十五年来，国际关系上发生了特别紧张的形势。世界帝国主义现在已经变得更加猖狂、更加野蛮了。这是可以理解的。资本主义已经进入它得势以来最困难的阶段。它正处在苦恼中，正处在神经错乱中，想“爬上一道墙”，希特勒就是从这里滚下去而遭到可耻覆灭的。
    同志们！罗马尼亚人民与苏联及其他国家人民间的友谊，一定会逐步发展与壮大。我们两国间的友好合作互助条约生动地证明了我们两国的相互了解与密切联系。
    苏联人民和罗马尼亚人民之间在过去几年来所形成的这种新关系是历史上从所未有的，可以说是各国人民间及各个国家间的关系的新的典范。这些关系的基础是无产阶级国际主义的原则，是列宁——斯大林的外交政策。这些国际关系的原则的出发点是承认一切大大小小的国家和民族完全平等。由于各国在列宁和斯大林的胜利旗帜下，兄弟般互助，为实现社会主义、为争取人类的光明前途进行共同的斗争，这些原则是加强了。
    无产阶级国际主义的坚定不移的原则，和那些决定帝国主义阵营各国关系的现代资产阶级侵略性的帝国主义和民族主义的兽性思想，恰好构成鲜明的对照。美国和它的“盟国”的关系可以用肥头大耳的主人和贫穷潦倒的食客的关系来比拟，主人因有黄金与权势而骄横自大，食客则甘愿替主人服务，愿意从事任何卑鄙的行为。美国垄断资本家公开的掠夺、放肆的剥削马歇尔化各国的国家财富——这就是这种关系的例子和结果。
    今日的南斯拉夫的命运是悲惨的。那个国家的统治者出卖了他们极善良、极诚实的人民，背叛了社会主义与民主的阵营而投向了资本与最黑暗的反动的阵营。英美帝国主义者的可鄙的走狗——铁托、卡德尔、兰科维奇及其同伙在南斯拉夫恢复了资本主义制度；在逐渐取消了南斯拉夫人民的民主果实以后，为了它们外国主子的欢心及利益，铁托匪帮又实行了血腥的法西斯统治。但是铁托匪帮对南斯拉夫人民的野蛮暴行与恐怖，明目张胆地出卖南斯拉夫人民的利益与鲜血——这些都不会太长久的。南斯拉夫各族人民会找到方法结束铁托的法西斯政权，会找到方法解放它们受尽苦难的祖国的。
    同志们！在目前的情况下，当无产阶级的团结及所有社会主义与民主力量的合作日趋巩固的时候，罗马尼亚人民共和国及所有的人民民主国家与苏联的更紧密的团结、友好及兄弟之谊，对和平事业及社会主义事业，是有莫大重要性的。英美的帝国主义国家集团已经走上了大事扩张军备的道路，并且已经进而采取了直接侵略自由人民的行动。这从英美侵略者和杀人犯在朝鲜的血腥干涉可以看出。美英侵略者在朝鲜所做出的前所未闻的暴行，其野蛮与残酷程度在历史上实属空前未有。麦克阿瑟先生们、李奇微先生们与其他厚颜无耻的英美军事专家先生们，如果你们那样“勇猛地”向平壤以及英雄的朝鲜的其他城市与村庄的手无寸铁无家可归的小孩、妇女和老年人施展你们的空中“战略”和“战术”的话，那么你们的事情就糟糕了。
    但是，豺狼般的帝国主义野兽并不满足于在远东的这种公开掠夺。他们不惜用一切方法来阻止苏联的共产主义建设，来破坏中国建设新生活，来危害各人民民主国家。但是，帝国主义在这方面漫无止境的妄想却受到了他们自己的薄弱的能力的限制。
    在这种情形下，一切爱好和平的民族，特别是正在为争取和平而斗争的国家必须尽量提高它们的警觉性，以便避免和制止战争并保卫和维护和平。我们一刻也不能忘记伟大的列宁的话：“资产阶级随时准备用任何野蛮手段、残暴行动和罪恶来保卫垂死的资本主义奴役制度。”伟大的斯大林指出：“世界各国人民都不愿遭受战争灾祸所引起的贫困。他们正在百折不挠地为巩固和平和安全而战斗。”
    这方面的生动的例子就是国际间要求五大国缔结和平公约的运动。世界和平理事会新闻处最近发表的关于要求缔结和平公约的宣言的征集签名运动进展情形的报告，再度证明我们这个时代的强大的运动——全世界各国人民要求和平，要求加强爱好和平的人民与国家的阵营，要求阻止另一次世界大战火的运动——是不可战胜的。
    和平的力量正在一天一天地壮大着、加强着。强大的苏维埃国家——一切国家的和平与安全的堡垒——站在这个史无前例的斗争的最前列。人民民主国家在坚决地真诚地保卫着和平事业。
    同志们！七年来，罗马尼亚人民在他们的工人党的领导之下一直沿着加强与苏联和人民民主国家的兄弟关系的正确道路向前迈进，并一直和我们一起为和平，为社会主义而斗争。
    苏联代表团谨再三衷诚地预祝罗马尼亚人民、政府和工人党在建设社会主义社会的工作中，在争取全世界真正和平的斗争中获得更大的胜利。
    （伏罗希洛夫演说结束时，全场掌声雷动，历久不息，到会者全体起立，为罗马尼亚人民和全世界各国人民的伟大友人斯大林而发出的欢呼声响遍全场。）
