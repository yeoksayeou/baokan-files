　　U.S. Worker's Daily and Belgian Red Flag Expose U.S. Tricks to Delay Armistice Negotiations
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 10th: New York's "Worker's Daily" published an editorial on August 6th, commenting on the U.S. side's behavior of not attending the meeting under the pretext of an accidental incident in which some of our guard personnel mistakenly entered the Kaesong conference area, saying: "The Pentagon's negotiators are carrying out provocations one after another to sabotage the negotiations or cause them to break down."
　　The newspaper continued: "What we see here is that the purpose of the Pentagon's diplomacy is to prolong the ceasefire as much as possible, inserting obstacles, each larger than the last, into the negotiations to make a solution difficult, if not impossible. We see a despicable diplomacy that is clearly afraid of peace, because peace would 'ease' the profitable tension that plagues the world."
　　The newspaper pointed out: "But there are powerful forces at work in the world, and Washington-Pentagon leadership's diplomacy of expanding the war must take these forces into account, even though it is extremely unwilling to do so. If Washington breaks off the negotiations, it will fall into an isolation among good people such as even the Nazi barbarians of Hitler's Foreign Ministry did not encounter. Not many people in the world will not know who is to blame for prolonging the misery in Korea. Let Washington try every trick it has, the people will know the truth. The people of France, Britain, Italy, the entire Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the socialist countries will all know this trick. And the American people will not believe it either."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 10th: The Belgian Communist Party's "Red Flag" wrote in its August 6th editorial: "Ridgway's excuse for stopping the Kaesong negotiations is clearly irrelevant. This excuse was chosen inappropriately, because the guards on the Chinese and Korean side accidentally entered the neutral zone, while U.S. fighter planes have never stopped flying over the neutral zone."
　　"What happened before this successor to MacArthur clamored loudly and stopped the negotiations proves that it was an excuse," the Red Flag said, "because Ridgway even demanded that the ceasefire demarcation line be drawn between the current front line and the Yalu River." The Red Flag added: "Thus, we can understand what the U.S. demands are, and what the real meaning of the excuses put forward to sabotage the so-called peace negotiations is."
　　The Red Flag continued: "Due to the U.S. obstruction, Korea and China, for the sake of peace, have agreed to remove the issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the agenda. Perhaps the United States... thinks that Korea and China are making concessions out of fear. Then they are deceiving themselves! The cannibals controlled by Truman and Acheson have completely misread the true situation. Asians and Westerners are now meeting at the conference table for the first time as equals, and this equal status was earned by the Korean people with the aid of the Chinese people in resisting barbaric Western imperialism. The Korean people and the Chinese people support the peace demanded by the people. But if the fighting continues, then the United States and its accomplices will bear a terrible responsibility and will have to pay the price for their crimes."

### 美国工人日报和比利时红旗报  揭露美方拖延停战谈判诡计

    揭露美方拖延停战谈判诡计
    【新华社布拉格十日电】纽约《工人日报》于八月六日发表社论，评论美方借口我方部分警卫人员误入开城会议地区的偶发事件而不出席会议的行为说：五角大楼的谈判代表接二连三地进行挑衅，以破坏谈判，或使谈判破裂。”
    该报接着说：我们在这里看到了五角大楼外交的目的就是尽可能长期地不停火，把一个比一个大的障碍插进谈判来，使解决即使不是不可能，也变得很困难。我们看到了一种明显地害怕和平的卑劣的外交，因为和平会“缓和”那祸及全世界的、有巨利可图的紧张局势。
    该报指出：“但是，世界上却有强有力的力量在起作用，华盛顿—五角大楼领导方面的扩大战争的外交，必须把这些力量考虑在内，虽然它极端不愿这样做。如果华盛顿使谈判破裂，它将在善良的人类中间陷于连希特勒外交部的纳粹蛮人也没有遇到过的孤立状态。世界上不会有很多人会不知道延长朝鲜的惨况的罪过是谁。让华盛顿试试它的每一个诡计吧，人民是会知道真相的。法国、英国、意大利、整个亚洲、拉丁美洲、非洲、以及社会主义国家的人民，他们都会知道这种诡计。而且美国人民也不会相信的。”
    【新华社布拉格十日电】比利时共产党的《红旗报》在八月六日的社论中写道：李奇微停止开城谈判的借口显然是无关紧要的。这个借口选择得很不恰当，因为中朝方面的守卫人员是偶然误入中立区的，而美国战斗机却从来没停止在中立区的上空飞行。
    《红旗报》说：“在这位麦克阿瑟后继人大肆叫嚣而使谈判停止以前所发生的事情，可以证明那是一种借口。”因为李奇微甚至曾要求在目前战线和鸭绿江之间划定停战分界线。《红旗报》又说：“这样我们就可以明白美国的要求是什么，和为破坏所谓和平谈判而提出的借口的真正意义又是什么。”
    《红旗报》接着说：“由于美国的刁难，朝鲜和中国为了和平，已经答应从议程上撤销撤退一切外国军队的问题。也许美国……会认为朝鲜和中国是因为害怕而让步吧。那他们就是在自己骗自己！杜鲁门和艾奇逊左右的吃人生番们把真实情况完全看错了。亚洲人和西方人现在是第一次以平等的身份在会议桌前见面，而这种平等地位是朝鲜人民在中国人民援助之下抗击野蛮的西方帝国主义而得来的。朝鲜人民与中国人民是拥护人民所要求的和平的。但是，如果还要打下去的话，那么，美国及其帮凶们就要担负可怕的责任，并且要付出代价来抵偿他们的罪恶。”
