　　U.S. and Canadian Progressive Newspapers Criticize U.S.-Made Treaty Conspiracy to Expand Asian Aggression
    The New York "Daily Worker" published a commentary by John Pittman on the 20th, stating that the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan is, in essence, an aggressive alliance between Wall Street imperialism and resurrected Japanese imperialism. Efforts to implement this treaty will only exacerbate all existing struggles in Asia, expand the conflict in Asia, and further isolate the American people.
    He said: The Chinese people fought against Japanese imperialism longer than any other nation and suffered more from the savage atrocities of Japanese imperialism than any other nation, and destroyed most of the Japanese imperialist war-making capabilities. They cannot accept this draft. The Soviet Union, which has been invaded by the Kwantung Army several times, cannot accept this draft either.
    The Canadian Forum published an article on July 27 stating: The U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan must be completely rejected. Canada must reject this treaty. The article pointed out: "The American imperialists are clearly calculating: Japan has a population of 80 million, and they may be able to scrape together many divisions of cannon fodder. The total failure of their crazy plans to use the two puppets Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee has not taught them a great lesson."

    美制和约阴谋扩大亚洲侵略
    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】纽约“工人日报”在二十日发表约翰·皮特曼的评论说：美国对日和约草案骨子里是华尔街帝国主义与复活的日本帝国主义的侵略联盟，实行这个和约的努力，结果只会加剧亚洲现有的一切斗争，扩大亚洲的冲突，进一步孤立美国人民。
    他说：中国人民对日本帝国主义作战，时间比任何其他国家人民都长，遭受日本帝国主义的野蛮暴行比任何其他国家人民都多，并且击毁了日本帝国主义的大部分作战能力，他们不能接受这个草案。数度遭到关东军侵略的苏联也不能接受这个草案。
    七月二十七日的加拿大论坛报发表一篇专文说：对美国对日和约草案必须彻底地拒斥。加拿大必须拒绝这个和约。该文指出：“美帝国主义者显然在盘算：日本有八千万人口，他们也许可以搜罗许多师炮灰。他们利用蒋介石与李承晚这两个傀儡的疯狂计划的全盘失败，并没有使他们得到很大教训。”
