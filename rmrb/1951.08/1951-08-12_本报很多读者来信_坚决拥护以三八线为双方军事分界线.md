　　(I) To the Editors:
    The American imperialists, violating the principles of fairness and reason, refuse our principle of taking the 38th Parallel as the military demarcation line, creating a stalemate in an attempt to sabotage the armistice negotiations. This fills us with immense anger.
    Since the beginning of the armistice negotiations, our side has fully demonstrated our sincerity in striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on the issues of the neutral zone and the agenda. Conversely, during the negotiations, American imperialist aircraft have intensified their indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities in the rear of Korea, and have even repeatedly provoked us over the skies of Northeast China. Provocative offensives by the navy and army have also been constantly occurring. These facts fully expose the ugly face of American imperialism's lack of sincerity for peace.
    The Chinese people love peace, and we resolutely support General Nam Il's reasonable proposal to take the 38th Parallel as the military demarcation line. We will never accept the unreasonable demands of American imperialism.

            (II) To the Editors:
    The People's Daily has been reporting for days about American imperialism unreasonably creating a stalemate and attempting to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations. I felt an irrepressible anger after reading it!
    American imperialism refuses our reasonable proposal to take the 38th Parallel as the military demarcation line, and makes absurd demands on us,妄图企图 to penetrate deeply into our positions to establish "defensive positions" in preparation for a war of aggression. This kind of gangster behavior is intolerable to our peace-loving people!
    The indiscriminate bombing by the American imperialist air force in Korea and the provocative offensives by the navy and army, all this will not intimidate the Chinese and Korean people. The Chinese and Korean people eagerly desire peace, but will never accept any unreasonable demands. The Chinese and Korean people know how to use their own strength to strive for peace and defend peace!
    All the people of China must actively increase production, rapidly complete the task of donating airplanes, cannons, tanks and other weapons, consolidate national defense, and do all anti-American and aid-Korea work well. We will certainly be able to defeat any aggressor, defend our victorious achievements and world peace.

            (III) To the Editors:
    Seeing the arrogant and barbaric attitude of American imperialism in the Korean armistice negotiations in the newspaper, I felt extreme indignation.
    Taking the 38th Parallel as the military demarcation line is not only the basis for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, but also in line with the actual situation on the Korean battlefield at this stage. People all over the world, including the American people and even soldiers, unanimously believe that this is reasonable. Even U.S. Secretary of State Acheson has repeatedly admitted the rationality of taking the 38th Parallel as the military demarcation line. American imperialism now unreasonably proposes to extend the military demarcation line northward beyond the 38th Parallel into our territory. This fully exposes its lack of sincerity for peace.
    During the negotiations, the American imperialist air force and navy continue to cruelly slaughter the peaceful residents of Korea. American imperialist ground forces have also repeatedly invaded our territory. In the preparatory meetings, our side made the necessary concessions in order to strive for peace. American imperialism believes that its tricks of threats and deception have worked, fantasizing about taking advantage of the armistice, and using this to cover up its guilt for launching the war of aggression in the first place. We want to tell American imperialism: the Chinese and Korean people will not be deceived or intimidated! If you refuse to accept the fair and reasonable proposal of taking the 38th Parallel as the military demarcation line, you will surely reap the bitter fruit. All the Chinese people must strengthen all anti-American and aid-Korea work and complete the task of donating airplanes and cannons. Consolidate national defense and defend world peace. We resolutely support the fair and reasonable proposal of taking the 38th Parallel as the military demarcation line, and support this just proposition with practical actions.

### 本报很多读者来信  坚决拥护以三八线为双方军事分界线

专栏：读者来信

　　本报很多读者来信  坚决拥护以三八线为双方军事分界线
            （一）编辑同志：
    美帝国主义违背公平合理原则，拒绝我方以三八线为双方军事分界线的原则，以制造僵局，企图破坏停战谈判。这使我们感到无比的愤怒。
    自停战谈判开始以来，我方在中立区问题及议程问题上，已充分表现了争取和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意。相反的，在谈判期间，美帝国主义的飞机却变本加厉地滥炸朝鲜后方和平城市，甚至多次到我国东北上空挑衅，海陆军的挑拨性的进攻也经常不断。这些事实充分暴露美帝国主义缺乏和平诚意的丑恶面目。
    中国人民是热爱和平的，我们坚决拥护南日将军提出的以三八线为双方军事分界线的合理建议。美帝国主义的无理要求，我们绝不能接受。

            （二）编辑同志：
    人民日报连日揭露了美帝国主义无理制造僵局，企图破坏朝鲜停战谈判的报道。我看了感到难以抑止的愤怒！
    美帝国主义拒绝我方以三八线为双方军事分界线的合理建议，向我方提出荒谬绝伦的要求，妄图深入我方阵地建立准备侵略战争的“防御阵地”。这种流氓行径，是我们爱好和平的人民所不能容忍的！
    美帝国主义空军在朝鲜的乱轰滥炸和陆海军的挑衅进攻，这一切都不会吓倒中朝人民。中朝人民是热望和平的，但绝不能接受任何无理的要求。中朝人民是懂得怎样用自己的力量去争取和平，保卫和平的！
    全中国的人民，一定要积极增加生产，迅速完成捐献飞机、大炮、坦克等武器的任务，巩固国防，并做好一切抗美援朝的工作。我们一定能够打败任何侵略者，保卫自己的胜利果实和世界和平。

            （三）编辑同志：
    在报纸上看到朝鲜停战谈判中，美帝国主义那种狂妄蛮横的态度，我感到极度的愤恨。
    以三八线为军事分界线，这不但是和平解决朝鲜问题的基础，而且也符合现阶段朝鲜战场上的实际情况。全世界的人民，包括美国人民乃至士兵在内，都一致认为这是合理的。就连美国国务卿艾奇逊也曾经再三承认以三八线为军事分界线的合理。美帝国主义现在竟又无理地提出要把军事分界线向三八线以北深入我方地区之内，这充分暴露它是缺乏和平诚意的。
    在谈判进行中，美帝国主义的空军和海军仍不断残酷地屠杀着朝鲜的和平居民。美帝国主义地上部队也一再向我方进扰。在预备会议中，我方为争取和平，曾作了必要的让步。美帝国主义竟认为它威胁欺诈的伎俩发生了作用，幻想着利用停战捡便宜，更借此掩盖他最早发动侵略战争的罪责。我们要告诉美帝国主义：中朝人民是不会被欺骗、被吓倒的！如果你拒绝接受公平合理的以三八线为军事分界线的建议，必将自食苦果。全中国人民一定要加强一切抗美援朝工作，完成捐献飞机大炮的任务。来巩固国防，保卫世界和平。我们坚决拥护以三八线为双方军事分界线的公平合理的建议，并以实际行动来支持这个正义的主张。
