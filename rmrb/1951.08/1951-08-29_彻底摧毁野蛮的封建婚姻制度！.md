　　Completely Destroy the Barbaric Feudal Marriage System!
　　Anji County, Zhejiang Province
　　Marriage Law Not Well Publicized and Implemented
　　Anji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Has Begun Rectification
　　Anji County, Zhejiang Province, did not publicize and implement the Marriage Law well. The phenomenon of village cadres supporting the feudal marriage system and suppressing women's freedom of marriage is very serious. The Anji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has begun to rectify this.
　　The Anji County Democratic Women's Federation convened a county-wide women's representative conference on August 10th to review the implementation of the Marriage Law. According to the representatives, the majority of the masses have not received education on the Marriage Law; 86% of the 125 women representatives this time did not understand the content of the Marriage Law. Furthermore, many village cadres and cadres of the Women's Federation not only cannot implement the Marriage Law well, but instead support the feudal marriage system and suppress freedom of marriage. For example, a child bride in Ma'an Village had a poor relationship with her husband, and both parties agreed to a divorce. The village cadres criticized the woman and did not allow them to divorce. Li Fushan of Yangdian Village often beat and scolded his wife. The woman could not bear the abuse and requested a divorce. The village and township cadres criticized the woman instead. For example, the township head actually said, "If you two don't get along, you can sleep separately, eat separately, and live separately; but you cannot divorce." Many women who suffered under the feudal marriage system and demanded liberation were also criticized by the Women's Federation. For example, Cao Fengmei (female, 19 years old) of Xiaoshi Fourth Village was forced into marriage with Wu Shanbao by her parents. After marriage, the two parties had a poor relationship and often quarreled and fought. Cao Fengmei made two requests for divorce, both of which were criticized by the Women's Federation. The second time (early August), the Women's Federation even forced her to confess her "mistakes" and guarantee that she would not request a divorce again. Feeling that there was no way out, she hanged herself on August 11th but was discovered and rescued. Tong Xingzhen, a child bride in Lujia Village, was forced to marry at the age of fourteen and was beaten and scolded by her husband and mother-in-law every day. She joined the Women's Federation but dared not attend meetings; if she attended a meeting, she dared not go home for dinner. The Women's Federation instead thought she was acting like a hoodlum by not going home for dinner and expelled her.
　　Based on the above situation, the Anji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has conducted a preliminary review and believes that the leadership should bear the main responsibility for this. First of all, the County Committee did not seriously study and implement the Marriage Law and the Central Committee's notice to the entire Party on ensuring the implementation of the Marriage Law. The County Committee did not conduct specific research and arrangements on how to publicize and implement the Marriage Law, and did not educate cadres on the Marriage Law. Therefore, many cadres themselves do not understand the Marriage Law, let alone publicize and implement it. Now, the Anji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has called on all cadres in the county to seriously study the Marriage Law and vigorously publicize it to the masses so that the Marriage Law can be implemented.

　　Case of Forced Marriage Leading to Death
　　Local Government Should Swiftly Punish Criminals According to Law Editor:
　　I am telling you about a case of feudal marriage leading to death.
　　Cheng Erying, a girl from Yangcundian Township, Second District, Lingling County, Hunan Province, is only fourteen years old this year. Her mother arranged a marriage for her last year, wanting her to get married. Although Erying did not agree, she finally got married on December 19th last year under her mother's coercion. After marriage, she was often abused by her mother-in-law, Zhou Shihua, and was beaten and scolded every day. On July 15th this year, she ran back to her parents' home because she couldn't bear the beatings and scoldings. At her parents' home, she heard the publicity of the Marriage Law, knew that the government guaranteed freedom of marriage for men and women, and opposed parents' arranged marriages, so she resolutely refused to return to her husband's house. At the end of July, her husband's family repeatedly forced her to go back, and her mother also beat and scolded her every day, wanting her to return to her husband's house. Under the pressure from both sides, Erying went to the women's cadre, Comrade Wang Shulan, to appeal. Wang Shulan educated her mother several times. But her mother did not listen and still forced her to return to her husband's house. Erying had no way to think and hanged herself on July 31st, but was discovered and rescued by others. But her mother forced her even harder, and on August 1st, she tied Erying up and wanted to send her back. At that time, Erying said, "I would rather jump into the river and die than go back." Therefore, she was not sent away that day. The next day, her mother forced her to go back again. Erying committed suicide by jumping into the river on the way back home.
　　Editor: The Marriage Law has long stipulated and announced the abolition of the feudal marriage system of arranged and forced marriages and the unreasonable phenomenon of early marriage. But even now, there are still cases of feudal marriage leading to death. This is a serious problem. I suggest that the local government severely punish the criminals who forced Cheng Erying to death according to law, and through this specific fact, expose the crimes of the feudal marriage system, widely publicize and resolutely implement the Marriage Law.

　　Shen Fating, Militia Captain of Shendian Village, Cao County
　　Kidnapping and Beating Women to Suppress Divorce
　　County and District Governments Should Not Ignore This Editor:
　　Shen Fating, militia captain of Shendian Village, Tenth District, Cao County, Pingyuan Province, violated the Marriage Law, used matchmakers to deceive women into marriage, suppressed women's freedom of divorce, and violated human rights by beating the masses. The Cao County People's Government has not properly dealt with his illegal behavior.
　　Shen Fating used Li Chunyang and Shen Qixun, two villagers, as matchmakers to deceive the daughter of Zhu Zhao of Zhudian Village, Fifth District, Kaocheng County, Henan Province (adjacent to Cao County), into marrying him. After they got married on July 15th (without registering with the District People's Government), the woman discovered that she had been deceived and fled back to her parents' home, wanting to divorce Shen Fating. On the evening of July 21st, Shen Fating led eight militiamen from the village, carrying four guns, to Zhudian Village. He ordered four militiamen to guard outside the village with guns, and he led four militiamen to the woman's home, where they kidnapped the woman and her mother, Zhu Zhao. The woman's cousin, Zhao Shuangxi, found out and rushed to stop them, but he was also tied up by Shen Fating. After arriving at Shendian Village, Shen Fating hung the three of them in the village's eastern temple courtyard, severely tortured them, and threatened the woman to agree to live with him, and also demanded that Zhu Zhao and Zhao Shuangxi guarantee this. Under Shen Fating's coercion, the three of them had no choice but to agree.
　　On July 22nd, Shen Fating released Zhu Zhao and Zhao Shuangxi, and he himself led four militiamen to take the woman to the Tenth District People's Government of Cao County to complete the marriage registration procedures. On the way, Shen Fating also threatened the woman, saying, "After arriving at the district government, if you dare to say that you don't agree to marry me, I will beat you to death on the road back." After arriving at the district government, the woman was so scared that she dared not speak. The district government thought that Shen Fating was the militia captain and there would be no problem, so they did not inquire in detail and confusedly allowed them to register.
　　After returning, the woman tried to report the matter to the Fifth District People's Government of Kaocheng County. After investigation, the Fifth District People's Government of Kaocheng County sent a letter to the Tenth District People's Government of Cao County, asking them to handle the matter. However, the Tenth District People's Government of Cao County ignored it. The Fifth District People's Government of Kaocheng County sent another letter to inquire about the matter for the second time, and they then handed the matter over to the Cao County People's Government for handling. After interrogation and examination of the injuries of the woman, Zhu Zhao, and Zhao Shuangxi, the county's judicial section ruled that the woman and Shen Fating should divorce. However, they did not pursue Shen Fating's illegal behavior of violating the Marriage Law and infringing on human rights.
　　I believe that Shen Fating, as the militia captain, actually did such illegal and undisciplined things and should be severely punished. The Cao County People's Government and the Fifth District People's Government of the county have taken a lenient attitude towards his serious illegal behavior, which is very wrong. I hope they can face this matter squarely and deal with it quickly and seriously.

　　Luan Jizhou and other Village Cadres of Hongkou Village, Muping County
　　Interfered with Freedom of Marriage, Forcing Death
　　People's Government Has Imposed Legal Sanctions Editor:
　　Regarding the case of village cadres interfering with freedom of marriage and forcing death in Hongkou Village, our county, as published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on July 25th, after the Muping County Democratic Women's Federation filed a complaint, the County People's Court and the People's Procuratorate jointly sent personnel to investigate and clarify the case, and it has been completed. Now I will tell you about the process and results.
　　Yang Shuhu (male, 25 years old) and Yang Xianling (female, 20 years old) are collateral relatives beyond the fifth generation. They developed feelings in study and production and wanted to get married. This spring, Yang Xianling's mother, without Yang Xianling's consent, arranged a marriage for her with someone else. Yang Xianling often discussed this with Yang Shuhu, and once stayed overnight at Yang Shuhu's house for two nights with her younger siblings, and stayed overnight at Yang Shuhu's house alone for two nights. The village militia captain, Yang Xiuding, learned of this and discussed it with the militia instructor, Luan Jizhou. Luan Jizhou advocated mobilizing the militia to struggle against Yang Shuhu; Luan's wife also proposed to mobilize women to struggle against Yang Xianling. Yang Xiuding, after seeking the consent of Qu Ridong, the district armed cadre, convened a militia meeting on the evening of June 25th to struggle against Yang Shuhu. On the evening of June 27th, Yang Pijuan, the secretary of the village's Youth League branch, gathered young women again to struggle against Yang Xianling. After they were struggled against, Yang Xianling's mother was afraid of "losing face" and agreed to Yang Shuhu and Yang Xianling getting married. So the two of them went to the district government to register; but at that time, the district civil affairs cadre was not there, and they could not register. Later, Yang Xianling's father discussed with the civil affairs assistant, Huang Baoxu. Huang Baoxu did not resolve the matter at that time, only saying that he would talk about it when he had time. Therefore, Yang Xianling felt that there was no way out and hanged herself on July 9th.
　　According to the unanimous reflection of the deceased's family and the masses, the main responsibility for this matter should be borne by Luan Jizhou. Luan Jizhou had previously asked someone to persuade Yang Xianling to marry his son last autumn, but was rejected by Yang Xianling. Therefore, he held a grudge and often wanted revenge. For example, Yang Xianling's father was disabled and did not stand guard or cultivate land for others in the past; but since Yang Xianling rejected Luan Jizhou's marriage proposal, Luan Jizhou asked him to stand guard and cultivate land for others. He was also actively promoting this struggle against Yang Shuhu and Yang Xianling.
　　Based on the above situation, the County People's Government and the People's Court have made the following decisions and judgments: Luan Jizhou used private revenge, interfered with freedom of marriage, and forced death, and should bear the main responsibility for the case. He was given administrative punishment of dismissal; the court sentenced the offender to eight years of imprisonment. Yang Xiuding, the militia captain, had convened a struggle meeting once and prompted Yang Pijuan to convene a struggle meeting once, and should also bear certain responsibility for Yang Xianling's death; but this action was dominated by Luan Jizhou's malicious intent, so he was given a lighter punishment of dismissal; the court sentenced him to one year of imprisonment with a one-year reprieve. Yang Pijuan, the secretary of the village's Youth League branch, is a student of only sixteen years old with no work experience, and this action was completely dominated by Luan Jizhou, so she was only given criticism and education. Qu Ridong, as a district cadre, violated government decrees and blindly agreed to the struggle, which was a principled error. It is recommended that the military sub-district give him appropriate punishment. Huang Baoxu, the district civil affairs assistant, is currently acting as the district head, ignored the illegal events of village cadres, and did not report to the higher-level government after Yang Xianling's death, and was given the punishment of dismissal.

　　彻底摧毁野蛮的封建婚姻制度！
    浙江省安吉县
    婚姻法没有很好宣传贯彻
    中共安吉县委已进行纠正
    浙江省安吉县没有很好宣传贯彻婚姻法。乡村干部支持封建婚姻制度，压制妇女婚姻自由的现象很严重。中共安吉县委员会对此已进行纠正。
    安吉县民主妇女联合会在八月十日召开的全县妇女代表会议中，检查了婚姻法贯彻情况。根据代表们反映，群众大部没有受到婚姻法的教育；这次一百二十五个妇女代表，就有百分之八十六不了解婚姻法的内容。而很多乡村干部、妇女联合会的干部不但不能很好执行婚姻法，反而支持封建婚姻制度，压制婚姻自由。如马鞍村某童养媳与其夫感情不好，双方同意离婚。村干部竟批评女方，不许他们离婚。杨店村李夫山经常打骂妻子，女方不堪虐待，要求离婚。村、乡干部反而批评女方。如乡长竟说：“你俩感情不合，可以分开睡、分开吃、分开过；但不能离婚。”很多身受封建婚姻制度痛苦而要求解放的妇女，也曾受到妇女联合会的批评。例如小市四村曹凤美（女，十九岁），由父母包办与吴山保结婚。婚后双方感情不好，时常吵嘴、打架。曹凤美两次提出离婚要求，均被妇女联合会批评。第二次（八月初）妇女联合会并强迫她坦白“错误”，保证不再要求离婚。她回去觉得没有出路，就在八月十一日上吊自杀，幸被发觉获救。鲁家村童养媳童兴珍，十四岁就被迫结了婚，天天受丈夫婆婆打骂。她参加妇女联合会，但不敢开会；参加了会议就不敢回家吃饭。妇女联合会反认为她不回家吃饭，是学二流子，竟把她开除了。
    中共安吉县委员会根据以上情况，作了初步检查，认为领导上对此应负主要责任。首先，县委对婚姻法及中共中央关于保证执行婚姻法给全党的通知，没有认真研究和执行。县委对怎样宣传和贯彻婚姻法没有进行具体研究与布置，并未对干部进行婚姻法的教育。因此，很多干部自己都不了解婚姻法，更不能宣传并执行婚姻法了。现中共安吉县委员会已号召全县干部认真学习婚姻法，并向群众大力进行宣传，使婚姻法能够贯彻实施。

  湖南零陵县杨村甸乡
  发生包办婚姻逼死人命案
  当地政府应迅速依法惩办罪犯编辑同志：
    我告诉你们一件封建婚姻害死人的事情。
    湖南省零陵县二区杨村甸乡女孩子成娥英，今年才十四岁。她妈在去年就为她说妥亲事，要她结婚。娥英虽然不同意，但在她妈强迫下，终于在去年十二月十九日结了婚。结婚后，她经常受到婆婆周时花的虐待，天天挨打受骂。今年七月十五日，她因为受不了打骂，就逃回娘家。在娘家，她听到了婚姻法的宣传，知道政府保障男女婚姻自由，反对父母包办婚姻，就坚决不回婆家。七月底，她婆家再三强迫她回去，她妈也天天打骂她要她回婆家去。娥英在两头逼迫之下，就去找妇女干部王淑兰同志申诉。王淑兰对她妈进行了几次教育。但她妈不听，还是逼迫她回婆家去。娥英无法可想，就在七月三十一日上吊自杀，幸被旁人发觉而获救。但她妈反而逼得她更加紧了，在八月一日将娥英捆起来要送她回去。当时娥英说：“我跳河死了也不回去。”因而这天未送成。第二天，她妈又强迫她回去。娥英在被迫归家途中，就跳河自杀了。
    编辑同志：婚姻法早已明文规定宣布废除包办强迫的封建婚姻制度和早婚的不合理现象。但到现在，竟仍发生封建婚姻逼死人命的事情。这是一个严重的问题。我建议当地政府依法严办逼死成娥英的罪犯，并通过这件具体事实，揭露封建婚姻制度的罪恶，广泛宣传并坚决贯彻婚姻法。

  曹县沈店村民兵大队长
  绑架吊打妇女压制离婚
  县区政府不应置之不理编辑同志：
    平原省曹县十区沈店村民兵大队长沈法亭违犯婚姻法，利用媒人骗婚，压制妇女离婚自由；并侵犯人权，吊打群众。曹县人民政府对他这种违法行为没有正确处理。
    沈法亭利用同村李春阳、沈起训两人做媒，欺骗河南省考城县（与曹县接壤）第五区朱店村朱赵氏的女儿和他结婚。七月十五日他们结婚（未向区人民政府登记）后，女方发觉受骗，就逃回娘家，要和沈法亭离婚。七月二十一日晚上，沈法亭带领该村民兵八人，持枪四枝前往朱店村。他叫四个民兵持枪守在村外，自己带领四个民兵到女方家里，把女方及她的母亲朱赵氏架走。女方的表兄赵双喜知道了，赶上去阻止，也被沈法亭捆走。到沈店村后，沈法亭把他们三人吊在村东庙院内，严刑拷打，威胁女方答应跟他过日子，并要朱赵氏、赵双喜作保证。在沈法亭胁迫下，他们三人无法，只得应允。
    七月二十二日，沈法亭把朱赵氏、赵双喜放了，自己领了四个民兵带女方到曹县第十区人民政府去补行结婚登记手续。在路上，沈法亭还威胁女方说：“到区政府后，你如敢说不同意和我结婚，回去我就在路上打死你。”到区政府后，女方害怕得不敢说话。该区政府认为沈法亭是民兵大队长，不会有什么问题，也不详细询问，糊里糊涂让他们登记了。
    回来后，女方就设法向考城县第五区人民政府告发这件事。考城县第五区人民政府经过调查，就给曹县第十区人民政府去信，请他们处理这件事。但曹县第十区人民政府竟置之不理。考城县第五区人民政府第二次又去信询问这事，他们才把这事交曹县人民政府处理。该县司法科经过审讯，并检查了女方及朱赵氏、赵双喜三人的伤势，就判决女方和沈法亭离婚。但他们对沈法亭违犯婚姻法和侵犯人权的非法行为却不加追究。
    我认为，沈法亭身为民兵大队长，而竟做出这种违法乱纪的事，应该受到严厉惩处，曹县人民政府和该县第五区人民政府对他这种严重违法行为采取了纵容的态度，是十分错误的。希望他们能够正视这件事，迅速认真处理。

  牟平县洪口村村干部栾吉洲等
  干涉婚姻自由逼死人命
  人民政府已予法律制裁编辑同志：
    七月二十五日人民日报“读者来信”栏所载我县洪口村村干部干涉婚姻自由，逼死人命一案，经我县民主妇女联合会提出控诉后，由县人民法院、人民检察署共同派员深入了解，弄明案情，已处理完毕。现将经过情况及处理结果告诉你们。
    杨书胡（男，二十五岁）和杨宪令（女，二十岁）是五代以外的旁系亲属。他们在学习和生产中发生感情，便想结婚。今春，杨宪令的母亲未经杨宪令同意，就代她和人订了婚。杨宪令为此经常和杨书胡商议，并曾与其弟妹共同在杨书胡家寄宿两夜，独自在杨书胡家寄宿两夜。村民兵队长杨秀丁知道了，便与民兵指导员栾吉洲商量。栾吉洲主张发动民兵斗争杨书胡；栾妻并提出要发动妇女斗争杨宪令。杨秀丁征求区武装干事曲日东同意后，在六月二十五日晚召开民兵会斗争了杨书胡。六月二十七日晚，该村青年团支部书记杨丕娟又召集青年妇女，斗争杨宪令。他们两人被斗争后，杨宪令的母亲怕“丢人”，便同意杨书胡和杨宪令结婚。于是他们二人便到区政府去登记；但当时区民政干事不在，未能登记。后来杨宪令的父亲找民政助理员黄保绪商议。黄保绪当时未解决此事，只说有空再说。因此，杨宪令感到毫无出路，于七月九日自缢而死。
    根据死者家属及群众一致反映，这件事情的主要责任应由栾吉洲负。栾吉洲在去年秋曾托人动员杨宪令和他的儿子结婚，被杨宪令拒绝。因此他怀恨在心，经常想报复。如杨宪令父亲是残废，过去不站岗、不代耕；但自杨宪令拒绝了栾吉洲的求婚之后，栾吉洲就要他站岗、代耕。这次斗争杨书胡、杨宪令，也是他积极推动的。
    根据以上情况，县人民政府及人民法院已作出如下决定和判决：栾吉洲因私报复，干涉婚姻自由，逼死人命，对该案应负主要责任，行政上给以撤职处分；法院判处该犯有期徒刑八年。民兵队长杨秀丁曾召开斗争会一次，并促使杨丕娟召开斗争会一次，对杨宪令之死亦应负一定责任；但他这次行动系受栾吉洲恶意支配，故从轻给予撤职处分；法院判处有期徒刑一年，缓刑一年。村青年团支部书记杨丕娟是一个年仅十六岁的学生，没有工作经验，这次行动完全受栾吉洲的支配，所以仅予以批评教育。曲日东身为区干部，违反政府法令，盲目同意斗争，实系原则错误，建议军分区给以适当处分。区民政助理员黄保绪现代理区长工作，对村干部违法事件置之不理，在杨宪令死后也不向上级政府报告，予以撤职处分。
