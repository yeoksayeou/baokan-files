Reaction to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

    The July 7th issue of the People's Daily published criticisms of our various shortcomings in the design of the Jinan Flour Mill project. We have conducted a self-criticism based on these criticisms. The facts and results of the self-criticism are listed below:

    In July 1950, the Flour Company commissioned us to build the entire Jinan Flour Mill project. After completing the design work on August 20th, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry decided to assign the construction part of the project to the Shanxi Construction Company. Therefore, we were only responsible for the design part of this project.

    The design of this project involved the reconstruction of an old factory. The original factory buildings had completely collapsed, and most of the old foundations were difficult to inspect because they were planted with crops. New wells near the construction site had a water level approximately four meters below ground level. There was also no accumulated water in nearby trenches and the basement behind the flour milling building. The design focused on the flour milling building (utilizing the old foundation), with other rooms arranged around this building according to the work sequence. The dimensions and locations of these rooms did not match the old building sites. At the time, we considered that while utilizing the old foundations would save a small amount of construction costs in the short term, it would hinder future production efficiency. Therefore, after discussing it with the Flour Company, we decided to abandon the old foundations and build according to the new plan.

    Based on the aforementioned facts, our main errors in the design work were twofold: First, we relied on general surveys only, without geological exploration, which was a serious error of empiricism. Second, the drawings for the five-story flour milling building only included the main parts, according to customary practice, leaving the minor parts to be drawn during construction. Later, because we were not involved in the construction, we neglected this. This was a manifestation of insufficient sense of responsibility. Furthermore, the flour milling building was originally based on the length of the old foundation, but the first draft of the floor plan was off by the thickness of a wall. This was corrected during the second resurvey. This was a manifestation of carelessness in the surveying work.

    In addition, there are two points that need to be explained: First, the original design of the dormitory did not hinder the laying of the railway. The Grain Company later changed the original plan for the convenience of transportation. Second, the cause of the water found under the foundation, according to the investigation, may be due to continuous rainy weather during construction, poor drainage on the construction site, or a broken water tap inside the factory. No one managed it before construction, and it leaked water day and night.

To the Editor:

    The July 7th issue of the People's Daily, on the second page, published a report titled "Taiyuan and Shanxi Construction Companies' Sloppy and Careless Design and Construction Lead to Repeated Abandonment and Reworking of the Jinan Flour Mill Construction Project." This criticism is entirely correct. We have accepted the criticism and conducted an inspection. The results of the inspection are as follows:

    On October 20th last year, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Industry assigned us the task of completing the construction of the Jinan Flour Mill. By the end of December, we had successively allocated 3.48 million catties of millet in funding. This funding included the cost of purchasing materials. However, we did not seize the time to purchase materials, delaying it until March of this year to buy the large timbers for the flour milling building. By then, the price of materials had already increased. When purchasing materials, we also did not pay enough attention to quality. For example, some of the willow wood we bought back was too wet, and the buildings constructed with it were not sturdy.

    The main reason for the rework during the construction of the flour milling building was that we simply relied on experience and only wanted to save money. We saw that the foundations of the old building were built with lime mortar, so we did not follow the original design specifications (the original design specified using cement, lime, and mortar). Instead, we simply wanted to save funds, without considering the quality of the project, and without contacting the Flour Company, we changed to using lime mortar for the foundation. As a result, the rework caused a loss of more than 38,000 catties of millet. In terms of materials, we lacked preliminary inspection. When the second floor of the building was about to be beamed, we discovered that some of the wood could not be used. Because we had to repurchase, we suspended work for 20 days, prolonging the construction time.

    Through this inspection, we have deeply realized that in construction projects, we must overcome the shortcomings of simply relying on experience and simply calculating profits and losses. At the same time, we must strengthen the inspection system during construction. Only in this way can we do a good job in construction.

    In order to make all employees pay attention to basic construction work, establish a humble and responsible attitude towards the people, and improve their professional and political level, we have collected the documents published by the People's Daily related to basic construction and the interim procedures for basic construction work issued by the Central Finance and Economics Committee, and mobilized all employees of the company and various factories and construction teams to study. Through this study, we will inspect all the projects we have done in the past one by one, and formulate measures to improve work and overcome shortcomings. The study is currently underway.

          Wang Zhengping, concurrently Manager of Shanxi Provincial Construction Company

    Editor's Note: When the Shanxi Provincial Construction Company was building the flour milling building for the Flour Company, in order to save funds, it arbitrarily changed the cement, lime, and mortar foundation specified in the design to lime mortar, which caused rework and waste. This practice of simply pursuing the profits of the unit, regardless of the safety of the building, is extremely wrong. This shows that the company has been infected with the reactionary ideas of the bourgeoisie in its management policy. This self-criticism report is not deep enough in its examination of this issue. It is hoped that the company can thoroughly criticize this issue from the perspective of leadership ideology during the study.

### 太原建筑公司及山西省建筑公司  对晋南面粉厂修建工程中一再返工浪费的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批语建议的反应

　　太原建筑公司及山西省建筑公司
    对晋南面粉厂修建工程中一再返工浪费的检讨编辑同志：
    七月七日人民日报上登载了我们在设计晋南面粉厂工程中的各种缺点，我们已根据此项批评进行了检讨。兹将事实经过与检讨结果列后：
    一九五○年七月间，面粉公司委托我们建筑晋南面粉厂全部工程。至八月二十日完成设计工作后，因山西省工业厅决定将工程施工部分交由山西建筑公司承做，所以我们对此工程只负责了设计部分。
    此项工程设计系旧厂重建，原有厂房已完全塌毁，多数旧基上因种了田禾而不易考察。工地附近有新筑水井者，水位约在地平四公尺以下，附近战壕内及制粉楼后面的地下室，亦无积水。设计时以制粉楼为主（利用旧基），其他各房即环绕此楼，按工作次序布置。这些房的尺寸、位置与旧有房址均不相符。当时曾考虑到如利用旧基，目前固然可节省一小部分建筑费用，但对于将来的生产效率，却会发生妨碍。因此，就与面粉公司研究决定，放弃利用旧基而按新计划建筑。
    根据前列事实研究，我们设计工作中，主要错误有两点：第一，设计前只凭了一般调查，没有地质探测，这是经验主义的严重错误。第二，五层制粉楼的图样，只依照惯例绘了主要部分，留下次要部分准备在施工期间边做边绘。后来因我们未参与施工，所以就疏忽了。这是责任心不够的表现。又，制粉楼本系利用旧基的长度，但在第一次绘出平面图时，却差了一道墙厚的长度，经第二次复勘时得到纠正。这是勘测工作中粗枝大叶的表现。
    此外尚有两点须要解释一下：一、原设计宿舍时，并不妨碍铺设铁路，后来粮食公司为运输方便才改变了原计划。二、地基下面发现水的原因，据勘查研究，可能是因为施工时连日阴雨，工地出水不畅，或者是厂内自来水龙头破坏，施工前无人管理，昼夜出水所致。
              太原建筑公司经理  张铁山
              副经理  田霁亭编辑同志：
    七月七日人民日报第二版刊载了“太原、山西两建筑公司设计潦草随便施工，晋南面粉厂修建工程一再弃工、返工”的报道。这个批评是完全正确的。我们接受了批评，进行了检查。检查结果如下：
    去年十月二十日，山西省人民政府工业厅把建筑晋南面粉厂的任务交给我们负责完成。到十二月底已陆续拨交三百四十八万斤小米的资金。这批资金包括购买材料费。但我们没有抓紧时间购买材料，直拖到今年三月份才把制粉楼用的大料买回来。但是材料已经涨价。在购买材料时，我们也没有很好地注意质量。比如买回的一部分杨柳木太湿，建筑起来的房子不结实。
    在建筑制粉大楼时，发生返工的主要原因，是我们单纯凭经验办事和单纯为省钱的结果。我们看到旧有的大楼是用白灰砂浆砌的根基，就没有按照原设计规定施工（原设计规定用洋灰白灰和砂浆），而只单纯为了节省资金，没有考虑工程质量，又没有和面粉厂联系，就改用白灰砂浆砌根基。结果造成返工，损失了小米三万八千多斤。在材料方面，预先缺乏检查，等到二层大楼要上梁时，才发现有的木料不能用。因为要重新购买，就停工二十天，拖长了工程时间。
    这次检查，我们深刻地认识到，在建筑工程中，必须克服单纯依靠经验办事和单纯计算盈亏的缺点，同时，在施工中必须加强检查制度。只有这样，才能作好建筑工作。
    为了使全体职工重视基本建设工作，树立虚心的为人民负责的态度，提高业务水平和政治水平。我们收集了人民日报发表的有关基本建设的文件及中央财政经济委员会颁发的基本建设工作程序暂行办法等，动员公司及各厂、各工程队全体职工进行学习。通过这次学习对以往所作工程一一进行检查，并订出改进工作克服缺点的办法来。现在学习正在进行。
          山西省建筑公司兼经理  王正平
    编者按：山西省建筑公司在建筑面粉公司的制粉大楼时，为了节省资金，竟擅自将设计中规定的洋灰白灰砂浆根基改为白灰砂浆，以致造成返工浪费。这种单纯追逐本单位的利润，不顾建筑物安全的作法是十分错误的。这说明该公司在经营方针上已沾染上了资产阶级的反动思想。这个检查报告，对这一问题的检讨是不够深刻的。希望该公司在学习中，能认真地从领导思想上把这个问题加以彻底批判。
