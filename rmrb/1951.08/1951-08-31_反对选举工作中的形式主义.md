Opposing Formalism in Election Work
    Lou Bangyan, Professor of Political Science, Peking University

A fundamental task in establishing a people's democratic government is to convene people's representative conferences at all levels and in all sectors across the country. Only with the full development of the people's democratic government can the country's industrialization be guaranteed, and the country's industrialization is the basic condition for advancing the new democratic revolution. Up to now, most regions have convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life, thereby making the connection between the government and the people closer, and greatly improving the people's sense of responsibility to the country. We recently went to Hebei Province to see the situation of political construction, and we feel that the construction of the people's democratic government has basically been successful, but some areas still have a tendency to neglect the work of political construction, and there is still serious formalism. I think it is necessary to point this out.

In some places in the old liberated areas of North China, because land reform was completed relatively early and revolutionary order had already been established, some cadres believed that building a people's democratic government on this basis could take a more "advanced" organizational form than in other places. The specific manifestation of this was implementing "universal suffrage" and formally convening people's congresses. In theory, implementing "universal suffrage" is certainly more progressive than implementing other election methods, and convening people's congresses is certainly more democratic than convening people's representative conferences. But the problem is that progress or lack of progress, democracy or lack of democracy, must not be measured so abstractly. Because adopting an impractical election method, even if it is theoretically more progressive than other election methods, it still does not help the work of political construction; similarly, we do not generally oppose people's congresses, and people's representative conferences will inevitably transition to people's congresses, but if we only put up a sign of "People's Congress" without paying attention to the actual content of the work, it is at most a formal embellishment of political construction. All of these are essentially influenced by bourgeois "formal" democracy and must be opposed.

The idea of formalism in the work of political construction, as specifically manifested in the vigorous "universal suffrage," is the most obvious typical example. Some local cadres do not seem to have fully noticed that Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi emphasized at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing: "The electoral method of 'universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot' cannot and should not be adopted all at once in China's current situation." They found some specious grounds and eagerly wanted to take a step forward in practice than other places, so they unconsciously were bound by the formalism of the old democracy, and the result was what Vice Chairman Liu said, "It gives the people many unnecessary troubles, damages the enthusiasm of the people, and in practice cannot make the people's congress elected in this way have more representative nature of the people, and therefore cannot use this method to make today's people's regime more democratic and more closely connected with the people." This fully illustrates the actual situation in some places. An'guo County, Hebei Province, in order to convene a people's congress, started to handle "universal suffrage" from July 1949, and did not completely elect the representatives until February 1950, which took seven months. This is really building a government for the sake of building a government, and electing for the sake of electing. In order to carry out "universal suffrage," the people universally and extensively delayed their daily production work. Isn't this "giving the people many unnecessary troubles"? According to the leading comrades of the special district, it was very laborious to do so. The masses' enthusiasm was high at the beginning, but gradually decreased. In fact, the people of An'guo County did not demand "universal suffrage." As a result, only a quarter of the voters in some villages participated in the election. In this situation, isn't it "damaging the enthusiasm of the people"? For some people who should be given special consideration, such as an appropriate number of women representatives, minority representatives, or even ordinary rich peasants in rural areas, it is not possible to achieve the goal through "universal suffrage." Therefore, isn't "universal suffrage" not necessarily able to "make today's people's regime more democratic and more closely connected with the people"? Therefore, without a doubt, demanding the implementation of the election method of "universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot" in China's current situation is an impractical formalistic approach. This kind of "formal" democracy is caused by the mischief of old democratic ideas, and at the same time, individual places also contain elements of vanguardism.

Based on the situation where "universal suffrage" has been implemented and people's congresses have been convened in some places, strictly speaking, it is still questionable whether what is implemented is "universal suffrage" and whether what is convened can be called a true "people's congress." For example, the result of An'guo County's implementation of "universal suffrage" is that not all representatives were elected by secret ballot according to the population ratio after the electoral districts were delineated. Among the 240 representatives, there were 16 representatives elected and sent by the organs. At the same time, although the secret ballot method was implemented in most electoral districts, some electoral districts implemented the open hand-raising election method. For example, the results of "universal suffrage" in Shijiazhuang City and Baoding City are that the representatives are mainly produced by professional groups, supplemented by regional representatives. Shijiazhuang City also added invited representatives. It can be seen from these examples that many cadres have not yet understood what the election method of "universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot" is. They ignore the actual situation that most people in China are still illiterate, have no election experience, and are not very concerned about elections for the time being, but they are more interested in the form of "universal suffrage" such as registering voters, dividing electoral districts, counting votes, and opening votes, and attempt to win an advanced name of "People's Congress." This is not a pragmatic approach, but in fact restricts the democratic political life of the people. The masses' reaction is that they do not want to engage in "universal suffrage." The masses only have a vague understanding of the fact that the people's representative conferences of all walks of life exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress, and of course they will not pay much attention to the sign of the "People's Congress."

Some people emphasize the form of democracy to the extent that it is opposed to the essence of democracy, thinking that in the old liberated areas, the essence of democracy has a solid foundation, and in the future, efforts should be devoted to a more complete form of democracy. This isolated view of the form of democracy can easily treat the work of building a people's democratic government simply as decorating the facade, hanging up signs, and holding ceremonies. It is true that the people in the old liberated areas have a relatively high political consciousness, but it is also certain that the democratic life of the people must continue to be cultivated, enriched, and consolidated. The correct approach should be to earnestly convene people's representative conferences in a widespread way, so that it becomes the basic system of our country, "so that this system can become a systematic, regular, and consolidated system of our country from the bottom to the top as quickly as possible." Such a complex work cannot and should not be an isolated and simple "democratic form," otherwise it would be vulgarizing the work of political construction to a certain extent.

Nevertheless, the experience of some counties and cities in carrying out "universal suffrage" and convening people's congresses is still very valuable for the entire work of political construction. It tells us that, according to the current actual situation in China, doing so has not enriched the content of the people's democratic political life; it tells us that, in order to promote the construction of the people's democratic government, the primary issue at present is to enable the people's representative conferences of all walks of life to quickly exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress; it tells us that, in the work of political construction, as in any other work, we must oppose all formalism and the remaining elements of vanguardism in a certain sense.

Facts have proved that the common people are not "afraid of trouble," and what they approve of are all simple and easy methods; as for some cadres who believe that not implementing "universal suffrage" is "taking a step backward," this is precisely the ideological concern that they should overcome. Blindly advancing without regard to objective conditions will inevitably run into obstacles. If you have advanced when you shouldn't have, only by taking a step back can you continue to advance in the correct direction of development.

### 反对选举工作中的形式主义

　　反对选举工作中的形式主义
    北京大学政治系教授  楼邦彦
    人民民主建政的一项基本工作，就是普遍在各地召开各级的各界人民代表会议。只有在人民民主政权得到充分发展以后，国家的工业化才有了保障，而国家的工业化是新民主主义革命得能往前推进的基本条件。直到现在，绝大部分地区都已召开过各界人民代表会议，因而使政府与人民的联系更加密切，人民对国家的责任心也大大提高。我们最近到河北省去看了一下建政的情况，觉得人民民主政权的建设工作基本上是有成绩的，但有些地区还存在着忽视政权建设工作的偏向，还存在着严重的形式主义，我认为有必要加以指出。
    华北老解放区的有些地方，由于土地改革完成得比较早，革命秩序也早已建立起来，有的干部就认为在这样的基础上建设人民民主政权，可以采取比其他地方更“前进一步”的组织形式，其具体表现就是实行“普选”，并形式地召开人民代表大会。在理论上，实行“普选”当然比实行其他选举方式要来得进步，召开人民代表大会也当然比召开各界人民代表会议要来得民主。但问题是：进步还是不进步、民主还是不民主，绝不能那样抽象地来衡量。因为采取一种不切实际的选举方式，即使它在理论上比其他选举方式更要进步，它还是无补于政权建设工作；同样的，我们并不一般地反对人民代表大会，而且人民代表会议势将过渡到人民代表大会，但是，如果仅仅挂上一块“人民代表大会”的牌子，如果不注意实际工作内容，它至多也只是在形式上点缀了政权建设。所有这些，在实质上是受了资产阶级“形式”民主的影响，需加以反对。
    政权建设工作中的形式主义思想，具体表现在轰轰烈烈地搞“普选”，是最明显的典型例子。有些地方的干部，似乎还未十分注意到刘少奇副主席在北京市第三届人民代表会议上所强调指出的：“‘普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票’的选举方式，在中国目前的情况下还不能因而也不应该一下采用。”他们找出了些似是而非的根据，急急乎想在做法上比别处前进一步，于是不知不觉地受了旧民主主义那一套形式主义办法的束缚，其结果就是刘副主席所说的，“它给人民许多不必要的麻烦，损害人民的积极性，在实际上并不能使这样选举产生的人民代表大会具有更多的代表人民的性质，因而也就不能用这种办法使今天的人民政权更加民主化，更加密切地联系人民。”这完全说明了有些地方的实际情况。河北省安国县为了要召开人民代表大会，从一九四九年七月起办理“普选”，直到一九五○年二月才把代表完全选出，前后花了七个月功夫，这真是为建政而建政、为选举而选举了。为了搞“普选”，使人民普遍而大量地耽误日常的生产工作，这岂非“给人民许多不必要的麻烦”？据专区的领导同志表示，那样做实在是十分费劲，群众起初情绪高，逐渐就低落了，实际上安国县人民并不要求“普选”，结果有些村子仅有四分之一选民参加了选举；像这种情况，岂非“损害人民的积极性”？又如对于有些人理应特别加以照顾，如适当数量的妇女代表、少数民族代表或竟至农村中的普通富农等，都不是通过“普选”所能够达到目的，所以说，搞了“普选”，岂非并不一定能“使今天的人民政权更加民主化，更加密切地联系人民”？因此，毫无疑问，要求在中国的目前情况下实行“普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票”的选举方式，是脱离实际的形式主义的做法。这种“形式”民主乃是由于旧民主主义思想作祟所致，同时个别地方还含有先锋主义的因素。
    根据在若干地方曾经实行过“普选”并召开了人民代表大会的情况来看，严格地说，究竟实行的是不是“普选”，召开的能不能被称作名符其实的“人民代表大会”，还是很成问题的。例如安国县实行“普选”的结果，全体代表并不都是在划定选区后，按人口比例一律用无记名投票的办法选举产生，在二百四十个代表中，包括十六个由机关选派的代表，同时，在大部分选区内，虽然实行了无记名投票的办法，也有一部分选区则实行公开的举手选举办法。又如石家庄市和保定市实行“普选”的结果，代表主要还是由职业团体产生，而辅之以区域代表，石家庄市并且还外加聘请的代表。从这些实例中可以看出，目前还有不少干部对于什么是“普遍、平等、直接、无记名投票”的选举方式还没有弄清楚，他们不顾中国大多数人民还不识字、还没有选举经验、暂时还不甚关心选举等实际情况，却对于登记选民、划分选区、检票、开票等“普选”的形式发生较浓厚的兴趣，企图争得一个先进的“人民代表大会”的名义。这不是实事求是的搞法，实际上反而限制了人民群众的民主政治生活。群众的反映是不想搞“普选”，群众连各界人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权一点尚只有模糊的认识，当然对于“人民代表大会”的牌子就不会十分在意。
    有些人把民主形式强调到和民主实质相对立的程度，以为在老解放区，民主实质已确具基础，今后应致力于更完备的民主形式。这种把民主形式孤立起来的看法，很容易会把人民民主政权建设工作单纯当作粉饰门面、挂上招牌、举行仪式一类工作看待。老解放区人民的政治觉悟比较高，这是事实，但是人民的民主生活还必须继续加以培养、丰富与巩固，这也是可以肯定的。正确的做法，应是普遍地把人民代表会议认真开好，使其成为我们国家的基本制度，“使这种制度尽可能迅速地成为我们国家从下至上的系统的经常的巩固的制度”。像这样一件复杂的工作，不能也不应该是可以孤立起来的单纯的“民主形式”，不然就是把政权建设工作在一定意义上庸俗化了。
    虽然如此，有些县市的搞“普选”和召开人民代表大会的经验，对于整个政权建设工作还是很可宝贵的。它告诉我们，根据目前中国的实际情况，这样做并没有充实人民的民主政治生活的内容；它告诉我们，要推进人民民主政权的建设工作，目前首要的问题是在于使各界人民代表会议迅速地代行人民代表大会的职权；它告诉我们，在政权建设工作中，像在任何其他工作中一样，必须反对一切的形式主义以及某种意义上的先锋主义思想残余。
    事实证明，老百姓并不是“不怕麻烦”，他们所赞成的是一切简便易行的办法；至于有些干部认为不实行“普选”就是“走回头路”，这正是他们应该克服的思想顾虑。不顾客观条件、盲目地前进的作法必然会碰壁，如果不该前进而前进了，只有肯后退一步，才有可能按照正确的发展方向不断前进。
