Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent's Commentary on the Kaesong Meeting:
	The 38th Parallel is a Fair and Reasonable Demarcation Line
	The US side's preposterous demand to establish a military demarcation line deep within our territory north of the 38th parallel has brought the meeting to a standstill.
[Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 8th] A special correspondent of this agency commented on the Kaesong meeting: The Korean armistice negotiation meeting was suspended for another day due to the US side's representatives not coming to Kaesong without reason. Three days ago, Ridgway used the accidental incident of some of our armed security personnel mistakenly entering the meeting area to interrupt the meeting for one day. However, after Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai satisfactorily replied to Ridgway's letter on August 6, Ridgway did not send a reply to our side until 2:30 p.m. yesterday (7th), but still did not determine a date for resumption. The US representatives' action of refusing to come to Kaesong for the meeting makes people around the world fundamentally doubt the US side's sincerity in the armistice negotiations.
	The purpose of holding the Korean armistice negotiation meeting is to solve the most acute problem in the world today - ending the bloodshed in Korea. Peace-loving people all over the world are watching Kaesong, hoping for the success of this solemn meeting. However, the negotiation meeting has been held for almost a month, and there have been no other practical gains except for reaching an agreement on the meeting agenda. In the discussion of the basic condition for realizing an armistice in Korea, namely, establishing a military demarcation line for both sides to establish a demilitarized zone, the meeting has been stalled because the US representatives resolutely refused to take the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, and preposterously proposed to establish the military demarcation line in the area deep within our area north of the 38th parallel.
	At the negotiation meeting, our representatives patiently and reasonably explained that taking the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line for both sides to establish a demilitarized zone is fair, reasonable, in line with the current military reality, and in line with the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world. However, the US representatives took the opposite attitude and put forward absurd and preposterous proposals. They also played the trick of intimidation inside and outside the meeting against the Chinese and Korean people and our representatives, vigorously promoting military force and boasting of the advantages of the naval and air forces. The great Chinese and Korean people have never been intimidated and threatened by imperialism; the powerful Chinese and Korean People's Army has never been intimidated by the imperialist naval and air forces. The Chinese and Korean people and the Chinese and Korean People's Army have defeated the US aggressor troops with light weapons in thirteen months of fighting, and have annihilated more than 270,000 enemy troops in the past nine months alone. The Chinese and Korean People's Army is one of the world's leading and powerful land forces. They also have a powerful artillery force that has not yet been used and a fairly powerful people's air force. Such a powerful army is invincible in the face of any enemy. The Chinese and Korean people love peace and resolutely advocate a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Therefore, they did not, like the US representatives, rely on their powerful army and demand "compensation" on the military demarcation line issue. Our side still fairly and reasonably proposed that the armies of both sides withdraw from the 38th parallel to establish a demilitarized zone. However, the US side's refusal to take the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line and its attempt to establish the military demarcation line deep within our area north of the 38th parallel is precisely an unjust action that prevents the negotiations from proceeding smoothly, the war from stopping quickly, and Korea from restoring peace as soon as possible. In the process of discussing the establishment of a military demarcation line and the establishment of a demilitarized zone, it has become clear which side has genuine sincerity for peace and which side is attempting to use the negotiations to obtain things that cannot be obtained by force and prepare for another war.
	Our representatives have made concessions on trivial issues such as reporters' interviews and the designation of Kaesong as a neutral zone, and on removing the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from the agenda, and have made earnest replies and guarantees on the issue of some security personnel mistakenly entering the meeting area. All of this shows our sincere desire to end the Korean War and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. This desire is also the common demand of peace-loving people all over the world. However, the US representatives have been making unreasonable demands on a series of trivial issues, delaying the progress of the meeting, and insisting on their absurd and preposterous proposal to establish a military demarcation line deep within our territory north of the 38th parallel, calling it "establishing a defensive position" and "ensuring the safety of troops." At the armistice negotiation meeting held for the sake of seeking peace, they never forget the war. During the negotiation period, the army continues to harass and attack, and the naval and air forces are also stepping up their indiscriminate bombing. People all over the world demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, but the United States is forcing its puppet countries to continue to send troops to reinforce Korea. According to the July 30 issue of the American magazine Time, since the start of the Korean armistice negotiations, the United States has transferred the 116th Bombardment Group of the Air Force, the aircraft carrier Essex, two cruisers, and some destroyers, which originally belonged to the "European" army, to Korea to destroy Korean cities and towns and kill peaceful residents. These facts show that the US side has not abandoned its plan to fight again even during the negotiation process. If one side still does not give up the plan to fight again in the armistice negotiation meeting, the negotiation meeting can never be successfully achieved.
	Due to the Soviet people's and the Chinese and Korean people's insistence on a policy of peace, and due to the peaceful wishes of the vast majority of mankind in the world, the US government accepted Malik's proposal and was willing to hold Korean armistice negotiations. However, at the Korean armistice negotiation meeting, the two sides of the policy of striving for an armistice in Korea and striving for peace in Korea and the policy of aggressive war still have to carry out a sharp and resolute struggle. This is manifested in the Chinese and Korean people's insistence on establishing the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line for both sides to establish a demilitarized zone; at the same time, they insist on opposing the establishment of a military demarcation line on the current front line, and even more resolutely oppose the absurd and preposterous proposal to move the military demarcation line deep into the area north of the current front line.

　　新华社特派记者对开城会议述评
    三八线是公平合理的分界线
    美方提出在三八线以北深入我方阵地内建立军事分界线的狂妄要求，使会议陷于停顿状态。
    【新华社开城八日电】本社特派记者对开城会议的述评：朝鲜停战谈判会议因美方代表无故不来开城而又停开一天。三天前李奇微曾借口我方部分武装警卫人员误入会议地区的偶发事件而使会议中断一天；但在八月六日金日成、彭德怀两将军圆满地答复李奇微的来信以后，直到昨天（七日）午后二时半，李奇微才有复信送给我方，可是仍未确定复会日期。美方代表借故不来开城开会的行动，使全世界人民要从根本上怀疑美方对停战谈判的诚意。
    举行朝鲜停战谈判会议的目的是要解决目前世界上最尖锐的问题——结束朝鲜境内的流血冲突。全世界爱好和平的人民都瞩望着开城，期望这一庄严会议的成功。但是谈判会议举行瞬将一月，除会议议程达成协议外，会议再未有其他实际的收获。在作为实现朝鲜境内停战的基本条件即确立双方军事分界线以建立非军事区问题的讨论中，由于美方代表坚决拒绝以三八线为军事分界线，而狂妄地提出将军事分界线建立在三八线以北深入我方地区以内的荒谬提案，使会议陷于停滞状态。
    在谈判会议上，我方代表以耐心和说理的态度阐明以三八线为双方军事分界线建立非军事区的公平合理，适合目前军事实际和符合于全世界和平人民的愿望。但是美方代表却采取了相反的态度，提出了荒谬狂妄的提案。他们并在会内和会外对中朝人民和我方代表玩弄了恫吓的手法，大肆宣传武力，夸耀海空军优势。伟大的中朝人民从来不会被帝国主义的恫吓和威胁所吓退；强大的中朝人民军队从来也不会被帝国主义的海空军所吓退。中朝人民及中朝人民军队在十三个月的战斗中曾经用轻武器就打败了美国侵略军队，仅在最近九个月中即歼灭敌军二十七万余人。中朝人民军队是世界上有数的头等强大的陆军。他们也已经有了一支尚未使用的强大炮兵部队和一支相当强大的人民空军。这样强大的军队，在任何敌人面前都是不可战胜的。中朝人民酷爱和平，坚决主张和平解决朝鲜问题，因此他们并没有像美方代表所做的那种自恃有强大的陆军，而在军事分界线问题上要求取得“补偿”，我方仍只是公平合理地提出双方军队撤离三八线建立非军事区。而美方拒绝以三八线为军事分界线，并妄图把军事分界线建立在深入三八线以北我方地区之内，正是使谈判不能顺利进行、战争不能迅速停止，也是使朝鲜不能早日恢复和平的非正义行动。在讨论确立军事分界线、建立非军事区问题的过程中，已经明显地表明了那一方是具有真正的和平的诚意，那一方又是企图利用和谈采取武力所不能取得的东西和准备再战。
    我方代表在记者采访、划开城为中立区等枝节问题，和在把撤离外国军队问题从议程上撤消等方面均作了让步，并在部分警卫人员误入会议地区问题上作了恳切答复和保证。这一切都说明了我方对结束朝鲜战争、和平解决朝鲜问题的真诚愿望。这种愿望同时亦是全世界和平人民的共同要求。而美方代表却以一连串枝节问题无理取闹，阻延会议的进行，并且坚持其提出的在三八线以北深入我方阵地以内建立军事分界线的荒谬狂妄的提案，而美其名曰“建立防御阵地”、“保证部队安全”；在为了谋取和平而举行的停战谈判会议上念念不忘战争，在谈判期中陆军仍继续窜扰进攻，海空军也加紧狂轰滥炸；全世界人民要求撤退在朝鲜的外国军队，美国却强迫其仆从国家继续派兵增援朝鲜。据七月三十日美国时代周刊透露：自朝鲜停战谈判开始后，美国又已将原属“欧洲”军的空军第一百一十六轰炸机大队、海军航空母舰伊塞克斯号、两艘巡洋舰和一些驱逐舰增调到朝鲜来，毁灭朝鲜城乡和杀害和平居民。这些事实说明美方即使在谈判过程中也并未放弃再战的打算。在停战谈判会议中如果有一方仍不放弃再战的打算，就决不能使谈判会议顺利达到成功。
    由于苏联人民和中朝人民坚持和平政策，由于全世界绝大多数人类的和平愿望，美国政府接受了马立克的建议，愿意举行朝鲜停战谈判。但在朝鲜停战谈判会议上，争取朝鲜停战、争取朝鲜和平的政策与侵略的战争政策两方，仍不得不进行着尖锐的坚决的斗争，这表现在中朝人民坚持确立三八线为双方军事分界线以建立非军事区的公平合理的主张；同时又坚持反对在目前战线建立军事分界线，更坚决反对将军事分界线深入目前战线以北的荒谬狂妄的提案。
