A Good Example of Serving the Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel
—A Record of the Long-Term Labor Service Team of the Chengdu Hardware and Electrical Appliance Industry
Li Pu

On June 8th, the day before the Dragon Boat Festival, thirty-six mobile vendors from the Chengdu hardware and electrical appliance industry, in front of the image of the people's leader Chairman Mao, raised their right hands and solemnly swore: "We will not bow our heads to any difficulties, we must do a good job in serving the families of martyrs and military personnel!"

June 9th was the Dragon Boat Festival. These thirty-six people visited and comforted fifty-five families of martyrs and military personnel, presenting them with zongzi, salted eggs, preserved eggs, big red flowers, and letters of sympathy. The families of the martyrs and military personnel were delighted by their earnest condolences.

From June 10th onwards, a strong force dedicated to serving the families of martyrs and military personnel appeared on the Dongyu Riverbank Street every afternoon. They carried two team flags, wore armbands, and held firewood knives, sometimes carrying water, sometimes chopping wood, asking about the families of military personnel like relatives. An old lady in her sixties said to a little student wearing a red scarf: "Since the Communist Party came, everything has changed. I have lived for so many years and have never seen so many good people. They don't take money, they just work, and they even ask if you are doing it right!"

On the morning of June 12th, it was raining heavily. Suddenly a child came to the labor service team, saying that his mother had suddenly become seriously ill and asked the labor service team to find a solution. No one in the labor service team knew how to treat illnesses, but they immediately sent someone to ask a doctor in the rain, curing the illness of Chen Suzhen, a member of a military family. Another afternoon, when the service team visited the families of military personnel Fu Huijiao and Yang Baosen, they found that the drain behind their house was blocked due to long-term neglect. The labor service team immediately mobilized and cleared the sewage and debris from the more than ten-zhang-long and one-chi-deep drain, and paved the drain smoothly. They also helped the 70-year-old Mr. Tang Huating (whose eldest grandson is fighting in Korea) carry potatoes. Mr. Tang's family was very grateful and said: "Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao do we feel the glory of being family members of revolutionary soldiers!"

In the past twenty days, the labor service team has carried a total of one hundred and nineteen loads of water for the families of martyrs and military personnel, chopped thirty-two bundles of firewood, and carried potatoes five times... These things seem trivial and ordinary, but they have solved many difficulties in the daily lives of the families of martyrs and military personnel.

How did the labor service team get started? The best answer is: their political awareness has been unprecedentedly enhanced. They listened to the report of Ji Bingqian, a representative of the returning volunteers from Korea, and studied the newsletter "Who is the Most Beloved Person," further recognizing the loveliness of the motherland, the loveliness of the great people's leader Chairman Mao, and the loveliness of the Chinese Communist Party. In order to better exert their strength, they formed this labor service team.

How does the labor service team work? The thirty-six of them are divided into seven groups, rotating once a week for two hours each time; this does not hinder their own business. Their working method is: setting up a service station in the place where they gather to study, with one person on duty every day, waiting for notifications from the families of martyrs and military personnel. In addition, the duty group sets off to visit various families from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day. The group leader keeps a diary every day, writing down what has been done and explaining what needs to be done to the next group clearly, and reporting matters that cannot be done (such as economic issues, production issues) to the Hardware and Electrical Appliance Guild, and then relaying them to relevant units. In order to continuously improve the work, a work inspection meeting is held every two weeks, and representatives are sent to attend the study meeting of the families of martyrs and military personnel every week to listen to opinions.

Under the influence of the labor service team, another sixteen members of the old metal group joined this service team on July 1st, thus their preferential treatment work was extended to the twenty-two families of martyrs and military personnel in the Huangcheng Police Station. On the same day, the mobile members of the glass group of the hardware and electrical appliance industry also swore an oath in front of the statue of Chairman Mao and established another labor team to serve the families of martyrs and military personnel.

The Chengdu Hardware and Electrical Appliance Industry Labor Service Team is a good example of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and military personnel. Due to their hard work, they have aroused the attention and praise of the broad masses of the people, and they are learning from them. However, the members of the labor service team are not proud of this. They said: "What does this count for! Caring for the families of martyrs and military personnel is like caring for our own relatives; for the sacrificed martyrs and for the soldiers defending the motherland, how can we not do a good job in preferential treatment work for a long time!"

　　为烈属军属服务的好榜样
    ——记成都市五金电器业的长期劳动服务队
    李朴
    六月八日，端阳节的前一天，成都市五金电器业的三十六个流动小贩，在人民领袖毛主席的像前，高举起右手，齐声发出庄严的誓言：“我们不向任何困难低头，一定把为烈军属劳动服务的工作搞好！”
    六月九日是端阳节，这三十六个人对五十五户烈军属一一进行了慰问，馈送粽子、咸蛋、皮蛋、大红花和慰问信。烈军属们都为他们殷切的慰问而欢欣。
    从六月十日起，东御河沿街一带每天下午出现了一支为烈军属服务的劲旅。他们打着两面队旗，佩着袖章，拿着柴刀，一会儿挑水，一会儿劈柴，好像亲人似的向军属们问长道短。一个六十多岁的老太太对一个围着红领巾的小学生说：“共产党来了，啥子都变了样，我活了这么大岁数，还没有见过这样多的好人，不拿钱光做事，还要问你做得对不对！”
    六月十二日的清晨，天下着大雨，忽然一个小孩来到劳动服务队，说他的妈妈突然得了急病，请劳动服务队想办法。劳动服务队是没人会看病的，但他们立即派人冒雨去请医生，治好了军属陈素贞的病。另一天的下午，当服务队访问到军属傅慧教、杨宝森时，发现他们屋后的阴沟因久未掏挖，堵塞了水道。劳动服务队立即动员起来，把十多丈长、一尺多深的阴沟里的污泥杂物掏挖干净，又把阴沟铺修平展。他们又帮助七十岁的老人唐华庭（他的长孙在朝鲜作战）挑洋芋。唐老先生一家人都非常感激，说：“只有在毛主席领导下，我们才感到做革命军人家属的光荣！”
    二十天来，劳动服务队共为烈军属挑水一百一十九担，劈柴三十二捆，担洋芋五次……。这些事情看来是琐碎而平常的，但这却为烈属军属解决了日常生活上的不少困难。
    劳动服务队是怎样搞起来的？最好的答案是：他们的政治觉悟空前地提高了。他们听取了志愿军归国代表嵇炳前的报告，学习了“谁是最可爱的人”的通讯，进一步认识到祖国的可爱，伟大的人民领袖毛主席的可爱，中国共产党的可爱。他们为更好地发挥自己的力量，成立了这个劳动服务队。
    劳动服务队是怎样进行工作的？他们三十六个人分成七组，每周轮一次，每次两小时；这并不妨碍他们自己的营业。他们的工作方法是：在集中学习的地方设立一个服务站，每天有一人值日，等候烈军属的通知。另外，每天下午五时至七时，值日小组便出发到各家访问。小组长每天记日记，把已做的事写下来，待做的事向下一组交代清楚，不能做的事（如经济问题、生产问题）反映给五金电器公会，再转告有关单位。为了不断改进工作，每两周举行一次工作检查会，每周并派代表参加烈军属的学习会，听取意见。
    在劳动服务队的影响下，旧金属组另外的十六位会员，于七月一日参加了这个服务队，因此，他们的优抚工作便推广到皇城派出所的二十二家烈军属。在同一个日子里，五金电器业玻璃组的流动会员，也在毛主席像下宣了誓，成立了另一支为烈军属服务的劳动队。
    成都市五金电器业劳动服务队，是优待烈军属的一个好榜样。由于他们的努力工作，已引起了广大人民的重视和赞扬，并向他们学习。但是，劳动服务队的队员们并不因此而骄傲起来，他们说：“这算得什么！爱护烈属军属就是爱护自己的亲人；为了牺牲的烈士，为了捍卫祖国的战士，我们怎能不长期搞好优抚工作呢！”
