　　The New Face of the Jinggang Mountains, the Old Revolutionary Base Area

　　The people of the Jinggang Mountains are actively rebuilding their homeland, which was destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits.
　　The Jinggang Mountains are located on the border of Jiangxi and Hunan. Within the surrounding eighty-odd li of undulating mountains, there are twenty-seven villages of various sizes, with a total of seven hundred and four households. In 1928, when the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army left here to expand the revolutionary base areas in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian, the Kuomintang bandits carried out cruel burning and killing against the people of the Jinggang Mountains.
　　After liberation, the People's Liberation Army quickly wiped out the bandits in the area, and the people of the Jinggang Mountains, under the leadership of the People's Government, carried out restoration and construction work. The People's Government successively distributed 50,000 jin of relief grain and 20,000 jin of agricultural loan grain. After the land reform was implemented in the entire area this spring, every household drew up patriotic production increase plans, bought nineteen head of cattle, and reclaimed 268 mu of farmland that had been barren for twenty years. Now, the late rice seedlings in the entire area are already more than three feet tall, swaying greenly in the wind. Older farmers say, "These are the best rice seedlings we've seen in twenty-one years!"
　　The reporter visited Dajing Village in the Jinggang Mountains. This is a beautiful mountain village, surrounded by mountains. At the foot of the mountains, which are covered with trees, there are sparsely scattered twenty-five peasant households. The villagers told us that when Chairman Mao lived here in 1928, there were more than sixty households in the village, and several large brick houses. Later, most of them were burned down by the "white dogs" (referring to the Kuomintang troops). Now, we can still see piles of burnt, earthen-yellow mud wall ruins. The village originally had about 700 mu of farmland, and the rice harvested was enough for the people of two villages to eat. Later, in order to avoid the "white dogs'" killings and conscription, they fled to other places, so a large amount of land was deserted. Since then, only twenty-odd households have remained in the village, and each family is short of half a year's food. The farmers have had to dig fern roots and bitter herbs to fill their stomachs.
　　After liberation, the farmers of Dajing Village have forever ended their miserable and impoverished lives. Last year, the village produced more than 7,000 jin of grain than before liberation. This year, the People's Government has also distributed more than 5,000 jin of relief grain. In addition to sideline production, no one is eating fern roots and bitter herbs this year. They are full of confidence in a future of abundant food and clothing. Labor model Zou Guizhang led us to see a large rice paddy in the southwest of the village, planted with late rice. He said, "When the 'white dogs' were here, this field was barren for twenty years, and the branches in the field had grown to be over ten feet tall. This spring, the men and women of the village worked together to dig up the big trees, turn over the field, and build a ditch next to the mountain to divert mountain water to irrigate the field. Now it has become good farmland." This year, Dajing Village has opened up more than forty mu of cultivated wasteland. They plan to reclaim all the more than 200 mu of barren land within three years, and with careful cultivation, Dajing Village will no longer have to buy grain from the foot of the mountain. Zou Guizhang's family opened up five mu of wasteland this year and planted seventeen mu of paddy fields. Each mu of field was fertilized with an average of 3,000 jin of cow dung and 200 jin of turf. Now they are weeding the second time and plan to add another 200 jin of cow dung, so that each mu can produce fifty or sixty jin more grain than last year, and next year they will not be short of food. He plans to rebuild a new house in no more than two years at the latest. He excitedly told the reporter, "When you come to see us again in two years, we will no longer be living in wooden sheds!"
　　The people of the Jinggang Mountains, whose lives have been initially improved, are enthusiastically demanding to study culture. Five primary schools and sixteen night schools have been opened in the area. There are more than 230 adult students in the night schools. Because the Jinggang Mountains lack kerosene, they burn pine resin and bamboo strips and read newspapers and learn to read under the blazing light every night. The Suichuan County People's Government is building a Mao Zedong Primary School in Ciping Village. It is expected that when school opens this autumn, it can enroll sixty or seventy peasant children for free.
　　The people of the Jinggang Mountains, who suffered the burning and killing of the Kuomintang bandits, all love the motherland and their own army. Last autumn, the people of the Jinggang Mountains paid all their public grain in seven days. The farmland of the thirty-seven revolutionary martyr families and revolutionary soldier families in the area who lacked labor has been voluntarily cultivated by the farmers. During the land reform, 161 young and middle-aged farmers joined the militia. After the Suichuan County Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea suggested that the people of the county increase production and donate a "Jinggang Mountain" fighter plane, the people of the Jinggang Mountains responded even more enthusiastically. They have already pledged more than 42 million yuan, and they plan to strive to complete the entire donation plan by September by increasing sideline production.

### 革命故乡井冈山区的新面貌

　　革命故乡井冈山区的新面貌
    新华社记者  金凯  岳革新
    井冈山区人民正积极重建曾被国民党匪帮毁灭了的家园。
    井冈山区位于江西、湖南边界，在周围约八十多里起伏的山峦里有二十七个大小山村，共有七百零四户人家。一九二八年中国工农红军离开这里向赣南、闽西地区扩展革命根据地时，国民党匪帮对井冈山区人民实行了残酷的烧杀。
    解放以后，人民解放军迅速肃清了境内土匪，井冈山区人民在人民政府领导下进行了恢复和建设的工作。人民政府先后发放了五万斤救济粮和二万斤农业贷款粮。全区在今年春天实行土地改革以后，家家都订立了爱国增产计划，共买进十九条耕牛，开垦了已经荒芜二十年的二百六十八亩农田。现在全区晚稻禾已长得有三尺多高，绿油油地随风飘荡。老年农民说：“这是二十一年来没有见过的好禾苗！”
    记者访问了井冈山区的大井村。这是一个秀丽的山村，四周环山，长满了树木的山脚，疏疏落落地居住着二十五户农民。村里农民告诉我们：一九二八年毛主席在这里住的时候，全村有六十余户人家，还有好几幢砖墙大屋，以后被白狗子（指国民党匪军）大部烧毁了，现在还可以见到一堆堆被烧毁了的土黄色的泥墙残址。全村本来有七百亩左右农田，收的稻谷够两村人民的食用。以后因为要躲避白狗子的残杀、抓丁，他们纷纷逃往异乡，因此大批的土地荒芜了。从那时起，全村只剩下二十几户人家，每家都缺半年口粮，农民们只得挖掘蕨根，苦荠充饥。
    解放后，大井村的农民永远结束了悲惨贫穷的日子。去年全村就比解放前多打七千多斤粮食。今年人民政府又发放了五千多斤救济粮，再加上副业生产，今年就没有人吃蕨根苦荠了。他们对未来丰衣足食的生活都充满着信心。劳动模范邹贵章领着我们去看村西南一大片长着晚禾的稻田，他说：“白狗子在时，这块田荒了二十年，田里的树枝都已长得有丈把高。今年春天，村里男女一齐动手，挖掘了大树，翻了田，又在山旁修起一条水沟，引下山水灌田，现在已成为良田了。”大井村今年开了四十多亩熟荒田，他们计划在三年内要将荒芜的二百余亩田全部开垦出来，再加精耕细作，大井村就再不用到山下买粮食吃了。邹贵章一家今年就开了五亩荒，种了十七亩稻田，每亩田平均下了牛粪三千斤，草皮二百斤，现在正在耘第二次禾，还准备再补下两百斤牛粪，这样每亩可以比去年多打五、六十斤粮，明年可以不缺口粮。他计划着最迟不过两年，就要重建新屋。他兴奋地和记者说：“两年以后你们再来看时，我们就已经不住在木棚子里了。”
    生活得到初步改善的井冈山人民，热烈地要求学习文化。全区已开办了五个小学校和十六个夜校。夜校共有成年学生二百三十余人。井冈山区因为缺少灯油，他们就烧着松脂竹片，每天晚上在熊熊的火光下读报认字。遂川县人民政府正在茨坪村新筑一所毛泽东小学校，预计今年秋天开学时，可以免费招收六、七十个农民子弟入学。
    曾经惨遭国民党匪帮烧杀的井冈山人民，个个都热爱祖国，热爱自己的军队。去年秋天，井冈山区人民在七天中就全部交齐了公粮。全区缺乏劳动力的三十七户革命烈士家属和革命军人家属土地都已有农民们自愿代耕。土地改革时有一百六十一个青壮年农民参加了民兵。遂川县抗美援朝分会建议全县人民增产捐献“井冈山号”战斗机以后，井冈山区人民更热烈地响应，他们已认捐了四千二百余万元，他们计划从增加副业生产中争取在九月前完成全部捐献计划。
