Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: The United States is currently directing the West German puppet government to intensify the work of forming West German mercenary troops under the guise of recruiting so-called "border troops" and "riot police."

According to a report by the Telepress Agency: The Bonn "government" recently appointed former Hitler general and organizer of the Nazi "Black Reichswehr," Matzky, as the commander of the "border troops." At the same time, it has begun to forcibly recruit "border police" in various parts of West Germany.

The so-called "border troops" are, in fact, the future West German regular army, which will be directly commanded by Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Aggressor Forces. Its own central command organization, the so-called "Border Troops Command," was established in Bonn in June and is, in fact, the headquarters of the future West German regular army.

However, the Bonn "government's" recruitment of "border police" in various parts of West Germany has not been smooth, which proves that the West German youth mostly oppose remilitarization and refuse to be cannon fodder for the American aggressors. According to a report by the Telepress Agency, the Bonn "government" has decided to transfer many traffic police to the "border troops" because the number of applicants is so small. In the Hanover area, many young traffic police officers have already been ordered to transfer to the "border police."

### 美国正指使西德傀儡政府  加紧编组所谓“边防部队”

　　美国正指使西德傀儡政府
    加紧编组所谓“边防部队”
    【本报讯】据新华社二日讯：美国目前正指挥西德傀儡政府，在所谓召募“边防部队”、“应变警察”等伪装下，加紧进行编组西德雇佣军的工作。
    据电通社报道：波恩“政府”最近已任命前希特勒将领、纳粹“黑色国防军”的组织者马茨基为“边防部队”司令；同时，并已开始在西德各地强迫征募“边防警察”。
    所谓“边防部队”，实际上就是未来的西德正规军，它将直接交由北大西洋侵略军总司令艾森豪威尔指挥。它自己的中央指挥机构，即所谓“边防部队指挥所”，已于六月间在波恩成立，它实际上就是未来西德正规军的司令部。
    但是，波恩“政府”在西德各地召募“边防警察”的结果却很不顺利，这证明了西德青年大都反对重新军国主义化拒绝替美国侵略者当炮灰。据电通社报道：波恩“政府”已决定把许多交通警察调到“边防部队”中去，因为应募的人数寥寥。在汉诺威一带的许多年青的交通警察已经因此奉命调作“边境警察”。
