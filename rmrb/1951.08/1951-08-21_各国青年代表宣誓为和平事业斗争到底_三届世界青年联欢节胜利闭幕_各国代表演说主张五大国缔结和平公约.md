Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 20th: The Third World Youth and Students Festival for Peace concluded on the 19th with a closing ceremony. Youth representatives from 104 countries summarized the achievements of the two-week-long international gathering of peace-loving youth representatives. They bid farewell to each other with enthusiasm and pledged to do everything in their power, even sacrifice their lives, to fight for the sacred cause of peace.

The closing ceremony was held in Marx-Engels Square. The flags of various countries were hung on the stage, decorated with flowers. At 4:00 PM, youth representatives from various countries participating in the festival marched from Kantian Street and held a two-hour demonstration parade in the democratic district of Berlin, before entering the venue. Leading the procession were youth delegations from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Hundreds of thousands of Berlin citizens crowded the streets to watch the solemn procession of the youth peace envoys from various countries and enthusiastically cheered "Friendship."

At 7:00 PM, President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic, Prime Minister Grotewohl, Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht, World Federation of Democratic Youth President Billinguer, International Union of Students President Groman, World Peace Council Secretary-General Laffead, Soviet Union Lenin Communist Youth League Central Committee Secretary Mikhailov, and Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee Chairman Kozimasov, among others, took to the stage amidst warm applause.

International Union of Students President Groman delivered the closing remarks, pointing out that the Third World Youth and Students Festival for Peace demonstrated the determination of youth from various countries to defend world peace and their achievements in culture and sports. Subsequently, World Peace Council Secretary-General Laffead addressed the conference, first pointing out the great achievements of the festival and the rising tide of the world peace movement, and emphasizing the importance of the five major powers concluding a peace pact to prevent war.

Mikhailov spoke amidst enthusiastic cheers, saying: The World Youth and Students Festival most powerfully demonstrated the youth's desire for peace and their determination to oppose war. The Soviet youth, raised under the education of Stalin, repeatedly proved their loyalty to internationalism, friendship between people of all countries, and peace. The Soviet youth will continue to maintain their glory and fulfill their obligations in the struggle for peace and the happiness of youth.

Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, delivered a speech at the conference.

American youth representative Silver spoke at the meeting, saying: The American youth representatives overcame various obstacles to participate in the festival and express their determination to fight for the maintenance of world peace together with youth from various countries. American youth know the responsibility that the American people bear in the struggle to maintain peace. We assure the participants of the festival and all young peace defenders that after we return home, we must do our best to strive for the victory of the cause of peace.

British youth representative Boclay and French youth representative Ducourant also delivered speeches. They both expressed that this peace festival, which united youth representatives from more than 100 countries, gave them new strength. British youth and French youth will fight more resolutely for peace and more actively collect signatures for the declaration demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact.

Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic addressed the conference, saying: During the festival, German youth and the German people have had the opportunity to express to the world how enthusiastically peace-loving Germany is fighting for peace and how resolutely it is protesting against the rearmament of West Germany. No German will ever again oppose any peace-loving nation, and no German will ever again oppose the Soviet Union. This festival has brought greater strength to the world peace camp, and the movement demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact will be launched more widely. German youth wholeheartedly support the world peace movement, because the liberation of their motherland depends entirely on the success of this movement.

World Federation of Democratic Youth President Billinguer finally read the oath of the participants of the World Youth and Students Peace Festival. Youth representatives from various countries raised their right hands and solemnly repeated three times after Billinguer: "We swear!"

The music of the World Democratic Youth March followed, and everyone in the audience sang along with the music. Magnificent fireworks were lit up at the venue. The two-week-long World Youth and Students Peace Festival concluded victoriously. (See pictures)

    三届世界青年联欢节胜利闭幕
    各国代表演说主张五大国缔结和平公约
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节于十九日举行闭幕大会。来自一百零四个国家的青年代表们总结了两星期来爱和平的青年代表的国际大会的成就，他们热情地道别，并互相保证要尽一切力量，不惜以自己的生命为神圣的和平事业而斗争。
    闭幕大会在马克思、恩格斯广场举行，主席台上悬挂着世界各国的国旗，并饰以鲜花。下午四点钟，参加联欢节的各国青年代表从堪蒂昂街出发，在柏林民主区举行两小时的示威游行，然后进入会场。走在最前面的是苏联、中华人民共和国、法国、英国和美国的青年代表团，成千成万的柏林市民都挤到街头，参观各国青年和平使者们的庄严行列，并热情地向他们欢呼“友好”。
    七时正，德意志民主共和国总统皮克、总理格罗提渥和副总理乌布利希、世界民主青年联盟主席比林格尔、国际学生联合会主席格罗曼、世界和平理事会总书记拉斐德、苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记米哈依洛夫和苏联青年反法西斯委员会主席科齐马索夫等在热烈的掌声中登上荣誉讲台。
    国际学生联合会主席格罗曼致闭会词，指出第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节表明了各国青年保卫世界和平的决心，也表明了青年们在文化和体育各方面的成就。接着，世界和平理事会总书记拉斐德向大会讲话，他首先指出联欢节的巨大成就及世界和平运动的高涨，并强调五大国缔结和平公约以阻止战争的重要性。
    米哈依洛夫在热烈的欢呼声中讲话，他说：世界青年与学生联欢节最有力地表明了青年对和平的热望与反对战争的决心。在斯大林教养下成长的苏联青年再三地证明了他们对国际主义、对各国人民间的友好及和平的忠诚。苏联青年将继续保持他们的光荣，履行他们在争取和平及青年的幸福的斗争中的义务。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬在会上发表了演说。
    美国青年代表希尔佛在会上发言说：美国青年代表克服了种种的障碍来参加联欢节，和各国青年一道表示他们为维护世界和平而斗争的决心。美国青年知道，美国人民在维护和平斗争中所负有的责任。我们向参加联欢节的人们和全体青年和平保卫者保证：我们回国以后，一定要竭尽全力争取和平事业的胜利。
    英国青年代表波克莱和法国青年代表杜科朗都发表了演说。他们都表示这次团结了一百多个国家的青年代表的和平联欢节给了他们新的力量，英国青年和法国青年将更坚决地为争取和平而斗争，更积极地为要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言征集签名。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥向大会致词说：在联欢节期间，德国青年和德国人民已有机会向全世界表示爱好和平的德国是如何热烈地为和平而斗争，如何坚决地抗议重新武装西德。没有一个德国人再会去反对任何一个爱好和平的民族，没有一个德国人再会反对苏联。这次联欢节给世界和平阵营带来了更大的力量，要求五大国缔结和平公约的运动将更为广泛地展开。德国青年全心全意地支持世界和平运动，因为他们的祖国能获得解放全靠这一运动的成功。
    世界民主青年联盟主席比林格尔最后宣读了世界青年与学生和平联欢节参加者的誓词。各国青年代表都举起右手，随着比林格尔庄严地重复三次：“我们宣誓！”
    世界民主青年进行曲的乐声跟着响起来，全场的人们都跟着音乐声齐声歌唱，会场上燃起壮丽的焰火，历时两周的世界青年与学生和平联欢节至此胜利结束。（附图片）
