Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, TASS dispatch on August 7th: Tokyo News: Japanese unions are firmly opposed to the US-made separate peace treaty draft with Japan and demand the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty.

　　The Executive Committee of the All-Japan Industrial Unions Council issued a statement, which emphasized: The US-made separate peace treaty draft with Japan "not only completely fails to meet the demands of the Japanese working people, but also completely fails to meet the demands of all Japanese people. It threatens world peace and endangers the independence of Japan." The statement said: "We absolutely cannot accept it because that 'draft' is unilaterally formulated and violates the Potsdam Proclamation and many international agreements. It only benefits one side and makes a comprehensive peace treaty impossible."

　　The National Chemical Industry Union also opposed a separate peace treaty "because it arbitrarily violates international agreements, obstructs China and the Soviet Union from signing this treaty, and stipulates the stationing of troops and the establishment of bases in Japan." The union pointed out in a statement: "This 'treaty' does not recognize the integrity of Japanese sovereignty; it paves the way for the establishment of a Japanese mercenary army to serve foreign countries." The union demanded the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty this year with the participation of the Soviet Union and China, and the immediate convening of a meeting of the four major foreign ministers.

　　The organ of the Tokyo Automobile Transportation Workers' Union, "Toka Labor," believes that the US-made separate peace treaty draft carries ominous omens.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 7th, delayed dispatch from Tokyo: Japan's largest progressive farmers' organization, the Japan Farmers' Association, held its third Central Committee meeting in Tokyo on May 27th and 28th. Fifty-four central committee members from twenty-two prefectures attended. The meeting passed a resolution stating: All Japanese farmers and all members of the Japan Farmers' Association unanimously oppose war and are determined to defend peace. We demand: (1) China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom convene a meeting to realize a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan within this year; (2) China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France conclude a peace pact to maintain and strengthen world peace. The resolution stated: The Japan Farmers' Association will strengthen all activities to promote the realization of these two demands.

　　The meeting also resolved to oppose the suppression of progressive newspapers and magazines and protested the "Matsukawa Incident." The meeting discussed the activities and reorganization direction of the Japan Farmers' Association and decided to hold the Fifth National Congress in Kyoto in late August this year.

　　日本各工会发表声明主张全面媾和
    坚决反对美制对日和约草案
    日本农民协会决议保卫和平要求全面和约
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社七日讯：东京消息：日本各工会坚决反对美制单独对日和约草案，并要求缔结全面和约。
    全日本产业别工会会议执行委员会发表了一项声明，其中着重指出：美制单独对日和约草案“不仅完全不符合日本劳动人民的要求，而且也完全不符合全体日本人民的要求。它威胁世界和平并危害日本的独立。”声明说：“我们完全不能接受它，因为那个‘草案’是片面拟订的，并且违反波茨坦公告和许多国际协定。它只对一方面有利并使全面和约成为不可能。”
    全国化学产业工会也反对单独媾和，“因为它专横地破坏了国际间的协定，阻挠中国和苏联签订这个和约，并规定在日本驻扎军队和建立基地。”该工会在声明中指出：“这个‘和约’并不承认日本主权的完整；它为建立日本雇佣军队替外国服务，铺平道路。”该工会要求今年在苏联和中国的参加下缔结全面和约，并立即召开四大国外长会议。
    东京汽车运送工会的机关报《东货劳动》认为美制单独对日和约草案带着不祥的预兆。
    【新华社七日讯】东京迟到消息：日本最大的进步农民组织——日本农民协会，在五月二十七、二十八两日在东京举行第三届中央委员会。出席者有来自二十二个道、府、县的中央委员五十四人。会议通过决议说：日本全体农民和日本农民协会全体会员一致反对战争，决心保卫和平。我们要求：（一）中、苏、美、英四国召开会议，在本年内实现全面对日媾和；（二）中、苏、美、英、法五大国缔结和平公约，以维护并加强世界和平。决议说：日本农民协会将加强一切活动，促进这两项要求的实现。
    会议并决议反对镇压进步报刊，抗议“松川事件”。会议讨论了日本农民协会的活动与改组方针问题，并决定于今年八月下旬在京都举行第五届全国代表大会。
