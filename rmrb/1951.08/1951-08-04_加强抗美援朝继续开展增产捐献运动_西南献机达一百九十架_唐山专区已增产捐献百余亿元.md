　　Strengthen the Resistance Against America and Aid Korea, Continue to Carry Out the Production Increase and Donation Movement
    Southwest Donates 190 Aircraft
    Tangshan Prefecture Has Increased Production and Donated Over 10 Billion Yuan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] The people of the Southwest region are continuing to develop the movement to donate airplanes and cannons. According to statistics up to the 28th of last month, the people of the entire region have initiated and decided to donate 190 aircraft, as well as 16 cannons and 11 anti-aircraft guns. The donation figures for various places are as follows: Chongqing City, 39 aircraft; Eastern Sichuan Region, 36 aircraft, 1 cannon; Southern Sichuan Region, 30 aircraft, 7 cannons, 4 anti-aircraft guns; Western Sichuan Region, 26 aircraft, 7 cannons, 4 anti-aircraft guns; Northern Sichuan Region, 27 aircraft, 1 cannon, 2 anti-aircraft guns; Guizhou Province, 12 aircraft; Xikang Province, 3 aircraft, 1 anti-aircraft gun; Kunming City (Yunnan Province) business community, 8 aircraft donated, women's community, 1 aircraft donated. In addition, there are four aircraft such as the region-wide "Southwest Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Aircraft" and "Southwest People's Film Aircraft".
    However, up to now, the development of the production increase and donation movement in the Southwest region is still uneven. Northern Sichuan Region and Western Sichuan Region and other places have fully and vigorously launched the movement. The "Nanchong City Aircraft" donation plan in Northern Sichuan has been fully completed, and the city's donation and pledge figures have reached over 1.52 billion yuan. Farmers in Lezhi County, Northern Sichuan, have pledged over 1.7 billion yuan. The donation movement in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces is just beginning and needs to be vigorously promoted.
    [Reported by this newspaper] Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province, has carried out in-depth propaganda and education work, enabling the production increase and donation movement to be smoothly and universally launched. According to statistics up to the 15th of last month, the people of the entire prefecture have donated over 10.76229 billion yuan for aircraft and cannons. Workers, farmers, industrialists and businessmen, government cadres, teachers, and students in various places have held meetings and formulated patriotic donation plans. In towns, all industrialists and businessmen have participated in the donation movement. Statistics from 1,554 large and small businesses in six counties, including Fengnan and Changli, show that they have donated over 430.3 million yuan based on improving operations and increasing income. In rural areas, except for a few mountainous and waterfront areas, almost every village has launched a production increase and donation movement. The broad masses of farmers put forward the slogan "Hoe cotton eight times, hoe large fields four times, increase production, and complete donations."
    In carrying out the production increase and donation movement, Tangshan Prefecture conducted in-depth publicity and mobilization work. In June, all thirteen counties in the region, except for Linyu County, held Resistance Against America and Aid Korea representative meetings under the personal chairmanship of the Secretary of the CCP County Committee and Director of the Resistance Against America and Aid Korea Branch. The prefecture also held a regional Resistance Against America and Aid Korea representative meeting. A total of 1,439 representatives participated in these meetings, generally activists in the Resistance Against America and Aid Korea movement. Through these meetings, the patriotic enthusiasm of the activists was guided onto the correct track. They conscientiously and responsibly examined and criticized the hasty emotions and the practice of not combining with production increase that were displayed in the early stage of the donation movement, and corrected the phenomena of coercion and commandism that had occurred in individual areas. In addition, they also corrected some representatives' incorrect understanding of the donation movement. The Resistance Against America and Aid Korea representative meetings of the prefecture and various counties discussed and determined the guidelines, methods, and steps for carrying out the donation movement, formulated patriotic donation plans for the prefecture and various counties, and clearly proposed that to do a good job in donation work, it is necessary to first do a good job in publicity and education work. After these meetings, after mobilizing the activists, the counties mobilized all cadres and various propaganda forces to widely carry out publicity and education work on production increase and donation to the people of all walks of life. Seven hundred reporters and more than 21,000 propagandists participated in this movement. (Ping Quan)

　　加强抗美援朝继续开展增产捐献运动
    西南献机达一百九十架
    唐山专区已增产捐献百余亿元
    【新华社重庆三日电】西南区人民捐献飞机大炮的运动正在继续发展。据截至上月二十八日止的统计，全区人民发起和决定捐献的飞机已达一百九十架，另外还有大炮十六门、高射炮十一门。各地捐献数字计为：重庆市飞机三十九架；川东区飞机三十六架、大炮一门；川南区飞机三十架、大炮七门、高射炮四门；川西区飞机二十六架、大炮七门、高射炮四门；川北区飞机二十七架、大炮一门、高射炮二门；贵州省飞机十二架；西康省飞机三架、高射炮一门；云南省昆明市工商界捐飞机八架、妇女界捐飞机一架。此外，尚有全区性的“西南邮电职工号”、“西南人民电影号”等飞机四架。
    但是，截至目前为止，西南区增产捐献运动的发展还是不平衡的。川北区、川西区等地已全面蓬勃展开。川北“南充市号”飞机捐献计划已全部完成，全市捐献及认捐数字已达十五亿二千多万元；川北乐至县农民已认捐十七亿余元。而云南、贵州两省的捐献运动还正在开始，尚待大力推进。
    【本报讯】河北省唐山专区深入进行宣传教育工作，使增产捐献运动得以顺利地普遍开展。截至上月十五日统计，全专区人民捐献飞机大炮款项已达一百零七亿六千二百二十九万余元。各地工人、农民、工商业者、机关干部、教职员和学生，都纷纷举行了会议，订出了爱国捐献计划。在城镇中，所有工商业者都投入了捐献运动。仅就丰南、昌黎等六个县的一千五百五十四户大小商号统计，他们在改善经营、增加收入的基础上，即捐献了四亿三千零三十万余元。在农村中，除个别的山区和水乡以外，几乎是村村都开展了增产捐献运动。广大农民提出了“棉花锄八遍，大田锄四遍，增加生产，完成捐献”的口号。
    在开展增产捐献运动中，唐山专区进行了深入的宣传动员工作。六月份，全区十三个县，除临榆县外，都在中共县委书记兼抗美援朝分会主任亲自主持下，召开了抗美援朝代表会议，专区也召开了全区的抗美援朝代表会议。参加这些会议的共有代表一千四百三十九人，一般都是抗美援朝运动中的积极分子。通过这些会议，把积极分子的爱国热情引导到正确的轨道上去。他们在会议上认真负责地检查、批判了捐献运动初期所表现的急躁情绪和不与增产相结合的作法，纠正了个别地区曾发生的强迫命令现象。另外也纠正了某些代表对捐献运动的不正确的认识。专区与各县的抗美援朝代表会议，都讨论和确定了开展捐献运动的方针、方法和步骤，制订了专区与各县的爱国捐献计划，并明确提出作好捐献工作，必须首先作好宣传教育工作。经过这些会议，发动了积极分子之后，各县又动员了所有的干部和各种宣传力量，向各界人民广泛展开了关于增产捐献的宣传教育工作。七百名报告员和二万一千多名宣传员，都参加了这一运动。（平权）
