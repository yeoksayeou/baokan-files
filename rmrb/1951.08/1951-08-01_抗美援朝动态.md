            Old Artists from Beijing and Shanghai Opera Circles Hold Charity Performances to Donate Airplanes and Cannons
    Veteran artists from the Beijing and Shanghai opera circles have successively held charity performances to donate airplanes and cannons. Over twenty veteran artists from the capital's opera circles, including Wang Yaoqing and Shang Heyu, held a meeting on June 8th. All of them were over sixty years old and had been away from the stage for more than ten to twenty years, but in order to donate airplanes and cannons, they unanimously decided to request to participate in the charity performances. Shang Heyu said: "Don't look at me being eighty years old, I must participate in the charity performance and donate airplanes to defend the country." Some people shaved off their cherished beards for the sake of the charity performances. They successively held two joint charity performances on June 17th and July 29th at the Dazhong Theater outside Qianmen.
    Veteran artists from the Shanghai opera circles also held charity performances for three days on July 16th, 17th, and 18th, earning 179.45 million yuan, all of which was donated to purchase airplanes. In the successive charity performances, the veteran artists demonstrated a high degree of patriotism. Xu Hongkui, 78, and Guo Diexian, 74, both took to the stage to perform. Xiao Lanying (female), 67, had not been on stage for 26 years and needed two people to support her when moving, but after she got on stage, supported by patriotic enthusiasm, she sang and acted very earnestly. She said: My participation in the charity performance is on the one hand to do my part for the people and donate airplanes and cannons; on the other hand, it is also to thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for liberating me from the oppression of the old society.
            Further Improve Preferential Treatment Work, East China Region Forms Visiting Group
    On July 25th, the East China Greater Administrative Region formed a visiting group composed of representatives from various agencies and people's organizations, which went to old liberated areas in Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui where the families of martyrs and soldiers were relatively concentrated, to visit the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, to express condolences to the wounded and sick, and to inspect local preferential treatment and medical work. In order to promote the further improvement of preferential treatment work in various parts of the region, the East China Military and Political Committee issued in mid-July the "Decision on Conducting a General Inspection of Preferential Treatment and Medical Work on the 'August 1st' Army Day," stipulating that around the "August 1st" Army Day, the people's governments of each province (region) should be responsible for initiating the formation of visiting groups composed of party, government, and military agencies, people's organizations, and democratic figures from all walks of life, to go to various places under their jurisdiction in a focused manner, to visit the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers, to express condolences to the wounded and sick, and to systematically inspect preferential treatment and medical work once.
