　　[News report] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Soviet newspaper "Red Star" recently published an article by Sarding entitled "The Filipino People Continue to Struggle." Sarding wrote: The Filipino working people suffer the oppression of American monopoly capital groups on the one hand, and the oppression of their own bourgeoisie and feudal landlords on the other. They are living an unbearable life of suffering. As a result of American rule, in the Philippines, a country with a population of less than 20 million, approximately three million workers are unemployed. The continuous rise in the prices of consumer goods, wage cuts, and unprecedented inflation have plunged the masses into poverty and famine. Manufacturers and handicraft workers in small factories are unable to compete with imported American goods and have gone bankrupt one after another. In the countryside, landlords collect rents accounting for more than 60 percent of the harvest. American colonists have turned the Philippines into a police state. All the basic rights of the people have been deprived.

　　Sarding then wrote: The People's Liberation Army of the Philippines is conducting armed struggle against the American colonists and their running dogs in the Philippines. The Filipino patriots have set their goals: to drive the American troops out of the country, to abolish the unequal treaties imposed by the US, and to implement progressive reforms throughout the country. The broad masses of the people throughout the country are united under these slogans. The People's Liberation Army has not only gained the support of the working class, agricultural laborers, and landless peasants, but also the growing support of intellectuals and the petty bourgeoisie. The weapons used by the People's Liberation Army units include modern weapons such as Thompson submachine guns, machine guns, and grenade launchers. Over the years, they have not only steadily controlled vast areas of Luzon Island, but have also been fighting successfully in almost the entire Philippines. The reactionary newspapers now have to admit that the mobile tactics of the People's Liberation Army units have inflicted blows on the government troops.

　　Sarding pointed out: Facing the heroic struggle of the Filipino people, the American imperialists are panic-stricken. The Philippine authorities have declared martial law throughout the country. The Philippine Senate is drafting a bill to execute those who join the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, the most unscrupulous terrorist methods are used to deal with democratic groups and patriots, first and foremost the Communist Party. Thousands of people have been arrested and held in concentration camps. However, the American reactionary newspapers have had to admit that the American colonists and their running dogs are encountering increasing resistance from all strata of the Filipino people who have risen up to fight for independence. Strikes are sweeping across the country. Recently, oil workers in Manila and thousands of workers in the Amak area sugarcane plantations have gone on strike. Armed uprisings by peasants are becoming more and more frequent.

　　Sarding concluded: No matter how desperately the colonists and their running dogs struggle, the Filipino people are continuing to fight for national freedom and national independence.

　　反对美菲反动派的奴役和压迫
    菲律宾人民英勇斗争
    人民解放军获得广大人民支持
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：苏联《红星报》最近发表萨丁所作的《菲律宾人民继续斗争》一文。萨丁写道：菲律宾的劳动人民一方面受美国垄断资本集团的压迫，一方面又受本国资产阶级和封建地主的压迫。他们正过着不堪忍受的苦难生活。由于美国人统治的结果，人口不到二千万的菲律宾，约有三百万工人失业。消费品价格的不断上涨，工资的削减和空前未有的通货膨胀，已使人民群众陷于赤贫和饥馑中。小型制造厂的厂商和手工业工人们，无力和进口的美国货竞争，都纷纷破产了。在乡村中，地主所收租金，占收获的百分之六十以上。美国殖民者们已把菲律宾变成了警察国家。人民的一切基本权利都被剥夺了。
    萨丁接着写道：菲律宾人民解放军进行着武装斗争，以反对美国殖民者及其在菲律宾的走狗们。菲律宾的爱国分子确定了目标：要把美军逐出国境，要废除美国的不平等条约，要在全国实施进步的改革。全国广大人民在这些口号下团结起来了。人民解放军不仅获得了工人阶级、农业劳动者和没有土地的农民的拥护，而且也获得了知识分子和小资产阶级的日益增长的支持。人民解放军部队使用的武器是汤姆枪、机枪和掷弹筒等现代武器。几年来他们不仅稳定地控制吕宋岛广大地区，而且差不多在菲律宾全境都进行着顺利的战斗。反动报纸现在也不得不承认：菲律宾人民解放军部队的机动战术，已使政府军受到打击。
    萨丁指出：面对着菲律宾人民的英勇斗争，美国帝国主义者们惊惶失措了。菲律宾当局已在全国宣布戒严。菲律宾参院正在拟订一项法案，要把参加解放军的人处死刑。同时，用最肆无忌惮的恐怖手段来对付民主团体和爱国分子，首先就是共产党。好几千人民被逮捕，被关在集中营里。然而，美国反动报纸不得不承认：美国殖民者和他们的走狗们遭遇到已经起来争取独立的菲律宾各阶层人民日益增强的抵抗。罢工运动遍及全国各地。最近马尼拉石油工人和阿马克地区甘蔗园的几千工人已举行罢工。农民们的武装暴动愈来愈频繁了。
    萨丁最后说：不论殖民者及其走狗们怎么样拚命挣扎，菲律宾人民正在继续为民族的自由与国家的独立而斗争。
