The Korean armistice talks, which began on July 10, have now been suspended due to the frantic provocations of the American side.

At 5:55 AM on August 19, the American invading army sent a small team to sneak into the Kaesong neutral zone and murdered Yao Qingxiang, the platoon leader of our military police in charge of patrolling, and seriously injured our soldier Wang Renyuan. Regarding the American side's act of murder, General Nam Il, the chief representative of our delegation, lodged a serious protest with Joy on August 19. However, before this incident was resolved, at 22:20 on August 22, the American invading army sent another plane to invade the airspace over the Kaesong conference site area and bombed and strafed the area near our delegation's dormitory.

This is an act of baseness and barbarism unprecedented in the history of diplomacy. Generals Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, lodged a serious protest with Ridgway on August 23 and announced the suspension of the Korean peace talks pending a satisfactory response from the American side.

Ridgway's response to the August 22nd incident, as well as Joy's response to the August 19th incident, were as base and barbaric as the murders they orchestrated. They dared to declare both incidents to be "fabrications" by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers aimed at breaking up the negotiations. Obviously, the resumption of negotiations is inconceivable until the American side changes this base and barbaric attitude.

The American imperialists' meanness and filth in front of the people of the East have reached their peak this time. This is an important lesson for the people of Korea, China, all of Asia, and the whole world.

People have of course long known that the US imperialists are aggressors. But there are all kinds of aggressors. Some aggressors, after expressing their willingness to negotiate peace, can temporarily stop their aggression and reach a truce agreement with their opponents. The American aggressors are not this kind of people. They still want to continue to expand their aggression in the negotiations, demanding to forcibly occupy more Korean territory, but they call this "defending themselves" and proving they have "sincere peace"!

From this, people know that American aggressors are arrogant in negotiations. But there are all kinds of arrogant people. Some people are openly arrogant, but disdain to use despicable and vulgar means to assassinate their opponents. The American bullies are not this kind of people. They not only secretly murdered the brave guardians of the Kaesong neutral zone they themselves demanded, but also attempted to assassinate the representatives who were formally negotiating with them from the air at night!

From this, people know that the American murderers are not soldiers and diplomats, but just a gang of bandits. But there are all kinds of bandits. Some bandits openly admit their bandit behavior after being verified and try to prove that those behaviors are justified. The American murderers are not this kind of people. After carrying out the murder, they did not try to prove that they were justified, but instead tried to prove that there was no murder at all, or that it was a murder by someone they didn't know, or that the murdered person murdered themselves!

This is the strategy adopted by the American delegation regarding the murder incidents of August 19 and August 22. They refused to conduct a serious investigation, refused to admit the facts obtained from the investigation, and refused to allow news reporters to go to the scene of the incident to observe. The American murderers fell into extreme confusion because of lying. On August 20, Nacos, a spokesman for the US delegation, said that the attack on the 19th "may have been done by North Korean guerrillas." On the 21st, the US military headquarters announced that "it is possible that this shooting incident was ordered by politically motivated plainclothes men." On the 22nd, Joy's reply said: "The United Nations Command cannot control or be responsible for the citizens of the Republic of Korea who automatically take up arms to resist invaders." Regarding the bombing on the 22nd, the US military headquarters said in a press release on the 23rd: US military liaison officers believe that the caves at the bombing site in the Kaesong neutral zone "may have indeed been caused by a Communist plane first dropping small canisters of napalm and small explosive canisters such as grenades, and then adding metal fragments from the plane." The US "Fifth Air Force reported that at 21:30 a plane of unknown nationality was detected by radar west of Kaesong." Truman said on the 23rd: "It is unclear whether any enemy planes were present. It is highly doubtful whether any bombing ever occurred." Ridgway's reply on the 23rd did not mention the caves on the ground, the napalm bombs, or the planes of unknown nationality at all, and only said that the entire incident "has been unreservedly condemned as a malicious lie completely without factual basis." This time, because of "observing leniency," he did not say that it was created by "plainclothes" planes that were "uncontrollable"!

In fact, all these lies of the American murderers are in vain. Haven't the big American tycoons and generals already openly declared their impatience with the Korean negotiations? Haven't they already openly declared that continued tension and continued war are in their interests?

In any case, the extreme ferocity and shamelessness of the American murderers will surely educate the people of Korea and China, as well as all the people in Asia and the world who hope for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War. The American government is the most despicable and barbaric government in the world today. It is strangling the armistice talks. It is determined to continue fighting against the people of Korea and China. The people of Korea and China must step up preparations to crush any new offensive by the American side and use even greater strength to force the American aggressors to accept a just peace.

### 美国的谋杀者给世界的教训

　　美国的谋杀者给世界的教训
    七月十日开始的朝鲜停战谈判，现在已因美国方面的疯狂挑衅而停顿了。
    八月十九日上午五时五十五分，美国侵略军派出它的一个小队伍潜入开城中立区，谋杀了担任巡逻的我方军事警察排长姚庆祥，重伤了我方战士王仁元。对于美国方面的谋杀行为，我方代表团首席代表南日将军在八月十九日向乔埃提出了严重抗议。但是在这次事件还未解决的时候，在八月二十二日二十二时二十分，美国侵略军又派出一架飞机，侵入开城会址区上空，轰炸和扫射我方谈判代表团宿舍附近地区。
    这是外交史上没有前例的卑鄙和野蛮的行为。朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在八月二十三日向李奇微提出严重抗议，并宣告朝鲜和平谈判会议的停会，以待美国方面令人满意的答复。
    李奇微对于八月二十二日事件的答复，以及乔埃对八月十九日事件的答复，和他们所布置的谋杀一样地卑鄙和野蛮。他们竟敢宣布两次事件都是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的旨在破裂谈判的“捏造”。很明显，在美国方面改变这种卑鄙野蛮的态度以前，谈判的恢复是不可能设想的。
    美国帝国主义在东方人民面前所表现的卑鄙龌龊，在这一次是登峰造极了。这无论对于朝鲜、中国、全亚洲和全世界的人民，都是重要的教训。
    人们当然早已知道，美帝国主义者是侵略者。但是有种种的侵略者。有一种侵略者在表示了愿意谈判和平以后，可以一时停止侵略，和对手达成停战协议。美国侵略者不是这种人。他们在谈判中仍然要继续扩张侵略，要求强占更多的朝鲜的土地，而他们却叫这是为着“防御自己”，并且为着证明他们有“和平诚意”！
    人们由此知道，美国侵略者在谈判中是蛮横的。但是也有种种蛮横的人。有一种人是公开蛮横的，却不屑于使用卑鄙的下流手段来暗害他的对手。美国的蛮横者不是这种人。他们不但在暗地里谋杀了他们自己所要求的开城中立区的忠勇的守护者，而且企图在夜间从空中谋杀正式和他们谈判的代表！
    人们由此知道，美国的谋杀者们并非是什么军人和外交家，而只是一伙盗匪。但是也有种种的盗匪。有一种盗匪在被证实以后就公然承认自己的盗匪行为，并且力图证明那些行为是有理由的。美国的谋杀者们不是这种人。他们在实行谋杀以后，并不力图证明自己是有理由的，却反而力图证明根本没有什么谋杀，或者是他们所不知道的某种人的谋杀，或者是被谋杀者自己谋杀自己！
    美国代表团关于八月十九日和八月二十二日的谋杀事件所采取的策略就是这样的。他们拒绝认真地调查，拒绝承认调查所得的事实，拒绝允许新闻记者前往出事地点观察。美国的谋杀者们因为说谎而陷于极端的混乱。八月二十日，美国代表团发言人纳科斯说，十九日的袭击“可能是北朝鲜游击队干的。”二十一日美军总部的公布说，“有可能这一射击事件是在政治上受人指使的便衣队奉令制造的”。二十二日，乔埃的复文说：“联合国司令部对于大韩民国的公民自动拿起武器抵抗入侵者，无法控制，也不负责任。”对于二十二日的轰炸，美军总部在二十三日公报说：美军联络官认为开城中立区被炸地点的洞窟“可能真是一架共产党飞机先投小筒凝固汽油弹和手榴弹之类的小炸药筒，然后再添盖飞机上的金属碎片所造成的”。美国“第五航空队报告在二十一时三十分在开城以西用雷达侦察出一架国籍不明的飞机”。杜鲁门二十三日说：“是否有任何敌机在场不清楚。究竟是否发生过任何轰炸也极可怀疑。”李奇微二十三日的复文根本不提地上的洞窟、汽油弹和国籍不明的飞机了，只说是全部事件“已被毫无保留地斥为完全没有事实根据的恶毒谎言”。他这次因为“遵守恕道”，竟没有说那是“无法控制”的“便衣”飞机制造的！
    其实美国的谋杀者的这一切谎骗都是白费心机。难道美国的大财主们和将军们不是早已公开宣布了他们对于朝鲜谈判的不耐烦吗？难道他们不是早已公开宣布了继续紧张状态和继续战争对他们的利益吗？
    无论如何，美国谋杀者的穷凶极恶和下流无耻，一定能够教育朝鲜和中国的人民，以及全亚洲和全世界的希望朝鲜战争和平解决的人们。美国政府是今天全世界最卑鄙最野蛮的政府。它是在绞杀停战谈判。它决心跟朝鲜和中国人民继续作战。朝鲜和中国的人民必须加紧准备粉碎美国方面的任何的新进攻，并用更强大的力量来迫使美国侵略者接受公正的和平。
