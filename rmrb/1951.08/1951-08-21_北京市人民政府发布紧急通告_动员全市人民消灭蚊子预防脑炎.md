[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] To prevent epidemic encephalitis, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has issued the following emergency notice:

    Epidemic encephalitis has occurred in the city. According to a report from the Bureau of Public Health, as of August 18, there were a total of 126 suspected cases. After identification by a special committee, 63 cases were clinically confirmed, including 4 cured, 36 currently under treatment, and 23 deaths.

    Encephalitis is currently in its epidemic period, with August and September being the peak season. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, so eliminating mosquitoes and eliminating mosquito breeding sites, especially eliminating accumulated rainwater where *Aedes albopictus* breed, is the main way to prevent encephalitis. It is hoped that all agencies, factories, schools, and households will do this work well. Specific measures are hereby stipulated as follows:

    1. All broken vats, jars, and other containers that accumulate rainwater and cannot be used should be completely removed.
    2. Containers that can accumulate rainwater should be turned upside down or have their water completely changed every five days.
    3. Water tanks, including those for fire safety, both indoors and outdoors, should have their water changed every five days.
    4. Lotus pots should be stocked with fish or have their water completely changed every five days.
    5. All households, agencies, and units should thoroughly check for places where water is stored and mosquito larvae are growing, and remove them.
    6. Public water tanks for fire safety should have their water completely changed every five days and must not contain mosquito larvae. This work is the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau.
    7. Ceramic ware businesses, soy sauce shops, dyeing shops, and other businesses with a large number of vats and containers should consult with their trade associations to cover or turn them upside down. This work is the responsibility of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the district governments to promote and inspect.

    The water in all kinds of water-accumulating containers mentioned above must be changed within three days, and thereafter every first and fifth day of the month.

    8. Inspect tree holes and fill them:
    （1）Trees in parks, the Forbidden City, temples, etc., are the responsibility of the park management committee and the Palace Museum and other responsible units.
    （2）Trees along roads and rivers are the responsibility of the Bureau of Construction and the Bureau of Sanitation Engineering.
    （3）Agencies, organizations, schools, factories, etc., are the responsibility of their respective units.
    （4）Each household is responsible for its own area, supervised by the health team leader.

    In order to do this work well, each district Public Security Sub-bureau and each police station should effectively assist the district health committees in urging health commissioners and health team leaders to mobilize the masses for universal and in-depth inspection. In addition, each Public Security Sub-bureau and police station should conduct inspections every five days during the encephalitis epidemic. If anyone is found not complying with the regulations, the Public Security Sub-bureau shall impose penalties as appropriate.

    If any suspicious symptoms are found, the patient should be immediately sent to the district health center for referral to an infectious disease hospital.

    It is hoped that all units and people from all walks of life will conscientiously and responsibly implement the above regulations. This concerns the safety of citizens' lives.

        Hereby notified.

        Mayor Peng Zhen
        Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu
                        Wu Han
