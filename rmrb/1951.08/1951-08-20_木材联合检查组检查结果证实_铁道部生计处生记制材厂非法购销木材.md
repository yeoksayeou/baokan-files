　　Joint Timber Inspection Group's Findings Confirm:
    Railway Ministry's Livelihood Department's Shengji Lumber Mill Illegally Purchased and Sold Timber
    The Joint Timber Inspection Group has conducted an inspection into the illegal purchase and sale of timber by the Shengji Lumber Mill, which is under the Livelihood Department of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government. Preliminary inspection results confirm that the mill indeed engaged in illegal timber trading, inflated timber prices, and profited handsomely.

    The Shengji Lumber Mill's business scope was originally limited to lumber processing. However, the mill engaged in large-scale timber trading. From August 1950 to July 1951, the mill purchased a total of 6,324 cubic meters of red pine logs and 71 cubic meters of finished red pine lumber. During this period, the mill sold 771 cubic meters of red pine logs and 203 cubic meters of finished red pine lumber to various agencies, public enterprises, and schools within the railway system; it sold 1,194 cubic meters of red pine logs and 1,005 cubic meters of finished red pine lumber to private merchants. (The higher sales figures for finished red pine lumber compared to the purchase figures are due to the sale of some red pine logs after processing.)

    The mill generally sold timber at prices higher than the official rates. For example, the average purchase price of red pine logs was 700,000 yuan per cubic meter (including freight and miscellaneous expenses), while the average selling price was 1,325,000 yuan. The average purchase price of finished red pine lumber was 1,000,000 yuan per cubic meter, while the average selling price was 1,669,000 yuan. As a result, the mill made a net profit of approximately 800 million yuan from August 1950 to June of this year.

    The majority of the mill's timber was illegally purchased from Northeast China through private merchants, while the rest was directly purchased by mill personnel stationed in the Northeast. This was a complete violation of the notification issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government on January 6th of last year, prohibiting departments and enterprises within the customs region from purchasing timber in the Northeast. Furthermore, the mill exploited its transportation advantages, using the name of the Livelihood Department of the Central Railway Ministry to request 73 railway cars for private merchants in the Northeast on two occasions. At the same time, it colluded with private merchants to speculate and profiteer, providing them with advance payments of 50% or even the full amount of the goods.

    In addition, the Livelihood Department extracted 2,169 cubic meters of red pine logs from the timber purchased by the Shengji Lumber Mill from the Northeast. The department controlled this timber at an average price of 700,000 yuan per cubic meter (including freight and miscellaneous expenses) and then sold 485 cubic meters to the Shengji Lumber Mill for 1,270,000 yuan per cubic meter, making a profit of over 270 million yuan in one transaction. It also sold 1,500 cubic meters to the Construction Engineering Department of the General Affairs Office of the ministry at a price of 1,200,000 yuan per cubic meter, earning another 750 million yuan or so. Furthermore, the Construction Engineering Department of the General Affairs Office sold 1,500 cubic meters to the Tieji Sawmill. The original purchase price was an average of 1,690,000 yuan per cubic meter, and the selling price was an average of 2,050,000 yuan per cubic meter, making a profit of 360,000 yuan per cubic meter in one transaction, for a total profit of over 500 million yuan. The above facts prove that the Livelihood Department and the Construction Engineering Department of the General Affairs Office also engaged in illegal profiteering.

　　木材联合检查组检查结果证实
    铁道部生计处生记制材厂非法购销木材
    中央人民政府铁道部生计处所属生记制材厂非法购销木材，木材联合检查组已进行检查。据初步检查结果证实：该厂确有违法经营木材生意、高抬木材价格，获取厚利的事实。
    生记制材厂营业范围，原为加工制材。但该厂却大量买卖木材。该厂从一九五○年八月至一九五一年七月共购进红松原木六千三百二十四立方公尺，红松成材七十一立方公尺。在这一时期，该厂已售与铁道部系统内各机关及公营企业机关学校的红松原木有七百七十一立方公尺，红松成材有二百零三立方公尺；售与私商红松原木有一千一百九十四立方公尺，红松成材一千零五立方公尺。（按上述红松成材的出卖数字比购入红松成材的数字多，是因为有一部分红松原木经过加工后被卖出。）
    该厂木材一般都是高于牌价出售。如红松原木每一立方公尺购入价格平均为七十万元（运价和杂费均包括在内），而出售的平均价格则为一百三十二万五千元。红松成材每一立方公尺购入价格平均为一百万元，而售出则平均为一百六十六万九千元。因此，该厂自一九五○年八月至今年六月，共获纯利约八亿元。
    该厂木材的来源，大部是非法通过私商自东北购来的，另一部分则是该厂派员常驻东北直接采购的。这完全违背了中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会去年一月六日发出的关内各部门及所属企业今后不得在东北采购木材的通知。而且该厂利用本身运输上的便利，以中央铁道部生计处的名义，代私商在东北两次索要车皮七十三辆。同时，有的预付私商货款百分之五十，甚至全部付货款，勾结私商投机牟利。
    此外，生计处在所属生记制材厂从东北共购进数内又抽出红松原木二千一百六十九立方公尺为该处掌握，价格平均每立方公尺七十万元（包括运杂费），而后又售与生记制材厂四百八十五立方公尺，每立方公尺价一百二十七万元，一转手间盈利两亿七千多万元；又售与该部总务处建筑工程处一千五百立方公尺，每立方公尺价格一百二十万元，又赚七亿五千万元左右。另外，总务处建筑工程处曾售与铁记锯木厂一千五百立方公尺，原进价平均每立方公尺一百六十九万元，售价平均每立方公尺价二○五万，一转手间每立方公尺赚了三十六万元，共获利五亿余元。从以上事实证明：生计处与总务处建筑工程处亦有违法牟利的行为。
