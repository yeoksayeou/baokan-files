　　On "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl"
        Ai Qing
    Recently, I have seen several performances of "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" and also read some of the scripts and stories of "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" published after liberation. The treatment of this myth in these works can be roughly divided into three categories:

    One category involves very little or no modification at all. During performances, they still adopt a farcical and amusing attitude to cater to the backward tastes of urban petty citizens, using "mechanical sets" as advertisements, engaging in some light and magic tricks, real cows and birds, and even some erotic lines. I heard that some even showed movies of fairies bathing, and a scene of selling popsicles was performed on stage. This kind of performance is the least serious, and the image of the characters is also caricatured. I once saw a performance at the North China Theater, with a very fat actress playing the Cowherd. This actress was a famous star, with a white and round face, gold teeth, silk clothes, and a gold-flowered black fan in hand. Sometimes she wore a raincoat made of green silk thread, followed by a page leading a real cow onto the stage, like a young master herding cattle; the Cowherd pretended to be naive, sometimes crying, sometimes laughing. Several ugly male clowns dressed as women were added to the fairy troupe, acting coquettishly.

    Another category involves significant modifications or complete rewrites, adding many new plots or completely reconstructing new plots, using the myth to reflect reality, combining it with the current domestic and international situation, land reform, the struggle against local bullies, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, resistance against America and aid to Korea, and the defense of world peace, and so on. This category accounts for the largest number. I have read several scripts that completely abandon the original myths and legends, relying entirely on each individual's creative ability to create anew. Ling He and Ye Jiang's "The Seven-Skill Marriage" published in Wuhan is entirely about human affairs. Although there was a dream of going to heaven, what was seen were also familiar people on earth; in the end, the Wang landlord was overthrown, and the Cowherd and Weaver Girl were reunited. The "East China People's Opera Series" has two scripts on this subject: Xu Jin's Yue opera "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl," which writes about the story of the Ming Dynasty, ending with a peasant uprising. Mo Yiping's Pu opera "The Begging for Skills Picture" also completely writes about human affairs, ending with a riot. In the "Popular Folk Readings," Yao Xin's "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl," in prose style, writes about the story of the Yellow Turban Uprising in the Han Dynasty, ending with a public trial of the Golden Arhat. These works stiffly mix many modern people's concepts and modern people's language, making some shocking remarks. In Yang Shaoxuan's script, the old yellow cow even sang Lu Xun's poem "Fiercely browed, I coolly face a thousand pointing fingers, Head-bowed, I willingly serve as a humble ox to the children"; when the villagers drive away the elders, they say "Your old ways are no longer needed now," "Your old superstition must be overthrown now," and so on; the plot also runs through the struggle between the peace dove and the owl, using it to reflect the current international relations, ending with "The Cowherd herds cattle on the hillside, the Weaver Girl is skilled at weaving, weaving a net in the sky and on the ground, catching the owl to gain peace." The most serious development of this tendency can be exemplified by the "Dazhong Peking Opera Troupe" in Wuxi performing "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" introduced in the second issue of the third volume of the Shanghai New Opera Report. The plot of this play can no longer find the original myth's thread and has completely become something else.

    ... Old Man Zhengli is the Old Man of Truth: his big abacus can calculate "past and future" based on scientific principles; he is refining sickles and axes in the stove on the mountain; he teaches the Cowherd and Weaver Girl to work, gives them tools, and promotes labor creating the world; he also uses the ox to symbolize tractors, and the magpie to represent peace birds, integrating the study of social development history, the stem borer control campaign, opposition to American imperialist aggression, and land reform propaganda into it. In terms of technique, it is quite similar to the Soviet film "The Magic Treasure Box". One dance even adopts the steps of the "Red Army Dance".

    The Green Leaf Island and Red Cloud Island in the play symbolize Taiwan and Korea. The Demon King is Truman. The gods under the rule of the Demon King, Tan Ge (prototype stink bug) is a tank, Fei Zhi (prototype cat-owl head) is an airplane, Hao Yue (prototype rocket) is gunpowder, Du Chong (prototype poisonous insect) is plague, Huang Bao (prototype ingot) is gold yuan, Qiu Neng is the atomic bomb, Ma Sui (prototype poisonous snake) is education, and Hu Mei (prototype fox) is diplomacy. These gods are full of food and leisurely. Finally, under the unity, awakening and resistance of the working people, they are all wiped out.

    There is also a category that adopts a more cautious attitude in dealing with this subject, generally retaining the spirit of the original myth. This type accounts for the smallest number. In Beijing, I have only seen the performance by the "Capital Experimental Pingju Troupe." Although it still has many shortcomings, I think this performance is more serious. The "Guangxi Opera" newspaper published the writing process of Qin Si's "The Legend of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" in its nineteenth issue. He advocates retaining the original myth's plot as much as possible. I have not seen the performance, so I will not discuss it here.

    The myth of "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" is one of the best literary creations of the Chinese people and a valuable legacy of our nation. Many poets throughout the ages have written poems on this subject. The history of this myth, as recorded in writing, is already more than two thousand years old. The region where this myth is spread covers the entire country. Although this myth has undergone some evolution, and the plots told in various places are not exactly the same, it can be roughly divided into two types:

    1. The Weaver Girl is the seventh (or ninth, according to one account) granddaughter of the Heavenly Emperor, weaving cloud brocade heavenly clothes on the east side of the Milky Way. The Cowherd takes care of cattle on the west side of the Milky Way. Both are diligent, and the Heavenly Emperor loves them, allowing them to marry. After marriage, they become greedy for ease and pleasure, abandoning labor. The Heavenly Emperor is angry and separates them, with the Milky Way in between, ordering crows to tell them to meet once every seven days. Because the crow conveyed the wrong message, saying once every July 7th.

    2. The Weaver Girl is the granddaughter of the Queen Mother of the West, weaving clouds in the sky. The Cowherd is a cowherd in the human world, abused by his brother and sister-in-law. One day, the cow tells him that the Weaver Girl and other fairies are going to bathe in the Milky Way, and asks him to take a fairy dress. When the Weaver Girl is looking for clothes, he goes to return it to her and asks her to marry him, and she will definitely agree. The Cowherd does as he is told. After the Weaver Girl marries the Cowherd, she gives birth to a son and a daughter. The Queen Mother of the West finds out and takes the Weaver Girl back. The Cow tells the Cowherd that he can put its skin on his body and chase him into the sky. When the Cowherd carries two children and chases into the sky, the Queen Mother of the West pulls out her hairpin and draws it behind the Weaver Girl, and it becomes the Milky Way, separating the couple. But they often weep across the river, touching the Queen Mother of the West, so she allows them to meet once every July 7th. When they meet, magpies form a bridge. Therefore, the myth of "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" is also known as "The Heavenly River Match," "The Milky Way Meeting," "The Seven-Skill Marriage," "The Begging for Skills Picture," and "The Magpie Bridge Meeting."

    Although the plots of these two myths are different, they are both based on the changes in the celestial phenomena of ancient people, combined with the plots in their own lives. From these two legends, I prefer the second legend. The plot generated by the first legend is entirely arranged by the Heavenly Emperor, and it also reflects that love and labor are contradictory. Therefore, there is first the Heavenly Emperor's "gift" and then the Heavenly Emperor's punishment. The second legend reflects the Chinese ancient working people's yearning for a happy life and the democratic concept of married life, but due to the limitations of the social system, it is impossible to achieve it perfectly. The obstruction of the Queen Mother of the West symbolizes the oppression of the Chinese feudal patriarchal society. This legend is an extremely beautiful poem of imagination, simple and healthy, so it can penetrate people's hearts for such a long time.

    Cherishing and sorting out such myths to make them more beautiful is one of the tasks of literary and artistic workers. Such myths can be expressed in various forms. But when rewriting, I hope you pay attention to the following points:

    1. Treat folk legends seriously, and retain as many beautiful plots as possible in the original legends, and do not destroy the pure imagination of the myth. Cherishing our nation's folk legends and the myths that have long been circulating among the people is a manifestation of our patriotic spirit and a mass viewpoint. Every nation has its own myths and legends. These myths and legends are combinations of the concepts of natural phenomena, life experiences, labor, love, and struggle of the ancestors of various nations. Many myths strongly reveal our ancestors' desire and will for a happy life. Many myths reflect the contradictions between two forces: man and god, man and demon, and the contradictions between good and evil in the world. These contradictions are the contradictions of class society. Sometimes people win, sometimes people fail, sometimes virtue wins, sometimes sin wins, sometimes it is reconciliation and compromise, which constitutes comedy and tragedy. When we adapt or rewrite, we must first study the evolution of these myths and grasp their basic spirit. We oppose the style of dealing with folk legends in a frivolous attitude, and oppose the barbaric act of arbitrarily slaughtering an originally beautiful myth.

    2. When rewriting, we must clarify the theme, and emphasize the three basic concepts of labor, love, and anti-feudalism. Restore the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl to their original appearance as working people. Some plays portray the Weaver Girl as a sentimental lady from a wealthy family, and the Cowherd as a fool. Some plays portray the Cowherd as a scholar. For example, in one script, the Cowherd sings when he comes on stage: "The autumn scenery is like a painting, white clouds fly, the willow waves hear the oriole, stepping on the green hoof, the shepherd boy sitting on the back of the ox, singing the slanting sun with a short flute." These are distortions of the working people. The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl should be hardworking, brave, and full of ideals, otherwise, how can they create life according to their own will: one who dares to defy the power of the Queen Mother of the West, and one who dares to marry a celestial fairy? And when the Weaver Girl is summoned back to heaven, how dare the Cowherd chase into the sky?

    3. Although myths are generated based on reality, they are not entirely reality. They are endowed with more imagination than reality. If these imaginations are removed, or reality is inappropriately emphasized, the simple and innocent beauty of the myth will be lost. Some people, when rewriting myths, are constrained by the truth of details and ignore the basic concepts of the ancient people who created these myths. They fabricate many plots and stiffly mix these plots into them, making the original myth's thread completely blurred. They like to use the mouth of any character to express some alarming so-called "philosophies." Myths are products of human infancy. Although they are simple and even do not conform to the common sense of natural science, they often express the class contradictions of ancient society in the most essential way and convey the living wishes of the ancient people. Therefore, they are basically true, scientific, and moving. To measure myths with ordinary scientific common sense will only result in condemning all myths to death. From the perspective of natural science, there is no such thing as the "Milky Way." This "Milky Way" is composed of countless stars, and the two stars, the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, will not meet once a year. The distance between them is at least tens of thousands of light-years. But in the creation of our ancestors, the Queen Mother of the West's silver hairpin became the Milky Way, and the magpies built a bridge so that the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl could meet! What a bold imagination!

    We must respect these imaginations and then rationally solve the conflicting parts (it is said that the Weaver Girl bathes in the Milky Way, so there was originally the Milky Way, and later the Queen Mother of the West drew a Milky Way, isn't there two Milky Ways?). Make the original plot more humane, and the addition of plots must also be based on these imaginations. If many of the original imaginations are changed, then you might as well write other myths.

    4. We are not generally opposed to innuendo. We oppose many so-called "metaphors" that are completely unrelated to historical facts and the plots of the original legends and are arbitrarily far-fetched. Symbolism is a very important part of literary expression techniques, but some authors create many so-called "metaphors" out of thin air. The author himself may be painstakingly conceiving, but the audience will only feel baffled. In one script, marrying a cart to an ox is used to "innuendo" the combination of production tools and exchange tools, which is very puzzling.

    Some people, when writing historical dramas and mythological dramas, want to "borrow the past to satirize the present," re-fabricating the plot of historical events according to current needs, or using the mouths of historical figures to express modern people's theories, or adding a little "innuendo" at the end. At the beginning of this year, I saw Jing Guoxue's play of "Investiture of the Gods", "Jiang Ziya and Nezha", which was full of gods and monsters. In the end, Jiang Ziya fought with Shen Gongbao, and Shen Gongbao turned into a paper tiger falling from the sky and being exposed, thus "piercing the paper tiger," which was said to be related to resisting America and aiding Korea. We say that literary and artistic work must reflect reality and must be connected with practice, but some people understand this meaning as simplified and vulgarized. They think that connecting with reality is just putting the central tasks of each period into the work like pasting slogans, completely regardless of what time, place, and event the work is writing about. Therefore, the Zhou Wenwang era is also written as resisting America and aiding Korea. In fact, the new continent of the Americas had not yet been discovered at that time!

    Some people completely take a negative attitude towards myths, and some people think that myths are superstition. This view is wrong. Myths and superstitions are easily confused, but we must distinguish them. What we oppose are those religious superstitions that promote karma and use the cruel punishments of the underworld and the eerie and terrifying ghosts to suppress people's rebellious psychology; but this does not mean that we want to eliminate imagination. Religious superstition conducts reactionary education to the people, while good myths inspire people's rational imagination and place ideals in life. Of course, myths are often mixed with superstitious elements. When rewriting, we must be good at distinguishing them and removing the superstitious elements. In the performance of "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl", the cow god uses "enlightenment" to make the Cowherd suddenly find himself in the family of a wealthy gentleman; after the Cowherd separates from his brother and sister-in-law, his brother and sister-in-law's house is burned by heavenly fire. These are parts that encourage people to completely rely on the gods for rewards and punishments and have a strong superstitious color. If they are deleted, it will not only not damage the original myth, but will only make this legend more reasonable, simpler, healthier, and more beautiful.

    In short, "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" is a myth familiar and loved by the Chinese people. We hope that a more complete script will appear in the future.

　　谈《牛郎织女》
        艾青
    最近我看了《牛郎织女》的几种演出，也读了一些解放后出版的《牛郎织女》的剧本和故事。这些作品对这个神话的处理，大约可以分为三类：
    一类是修改得很少，或者是完全没有修改，演出时，还是采取打诨凑趣的态度，迎合城市小市民的落后趣味，以“机关布景”为广告，搞一些灯光斗法，真牛真鸟，还有色情的台词等等。听说有的甚至放映仙女沐浴的电影，舞台上出演了卖冰棍的场面。这种演出，是最不严肃的，人物的形象也是丑化了的。我曾看见华北戏院的演出，以一个很胖的女演员饰牛郎，这个演员是名角，白胖的圆脸，镶了金牙，绸质的衣服，手拿金花黑扇，有时披上用绿丝线结成的蓑衣，身后随一琴童牵真牛上场，好像一个公子在放牛；牛郎装天真，忽哭，忽笑。仙女阵里加进好几个男扮女装的丑旦，忸怩作态。
    另一类是经过很大的修改，或是全部重写，增加许多情节，或是重新构造新的情节，借神话影射现实，结合目前国内外形势，土地改革，反恶霸斗争，镇压反革命，抗美援朝，保卫世界和平等等。这一类占数目最多。我曾看了几种剧本，这些剧本，把原来的神话传说一脚踢开，完全凭各人自己的构思能力来重新创造。武汉出版的凌鹤、叶江的《七巧姻缘》写的完全是人间的事，虽曾一梦到天上，所见也是地上的熟人；最后斗倒了王大户，牛郎织女团圆。“华东人民戏曲丛书”有两种关于这个题材的剧本：徐进的越剧《牛郎织女》，写明朝的故事，以农民起义为结尾。墨遗萍的蒲戏《乞巧图》，也完全写人间的事，以暴动为结尾。“民间通俗读物”中，姚昕的《牛郎织女》，散文体裁，写汉朝黄巾起义时的故事，以群众公审金罗汉为结尾。这些作品，十分生硬地掺杂了许多现代人的观念和现代人的语言，发一些惊人的议论。杨绍萱的剧本里，老黄牛竟唱了鲁迅的诗“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”；当村民赶走长老时说“你那老一套，现在用不着”，“你这个老迷信，现在要打倒”之类的话；剧情里，也贯穿了和平鸽和鸱枭之争，用以影射目前的国际关系，最后是以“牛郎放牛在山坡，织女手巧能穿梭，织就天罗和地网，捉住鸱枭得平和”为结尾。这种倾向发展得最厉害的，可以上海新戏曲报第三卷第二期所介绍的无锡“大众京剧社”演出的《牛郎织女》为例。这个剧的情节，已找不到原有神话的线索，完全成了另外一个东西了。
    …………郑里老人是真理老人：他的大算盘可以算出“过去未来”，乃是根据了科学法则；他在山上煮炉修炼的是镰刀斧头；他教牛郎织女劳动，送给他们工具，宣传劳动创造世界；还用耕牛象征拖拉机、耕鹊代表和平鸟等，将社会发展史的学习，治螟运动，反对美帝侵略、土地改革宣传这许多内容，都缝在里面了。在手法上则颇有模仿苏联电影《宝盒仙笛》之处。有一场舞蹈还采用了“红军舞”的步姿。
    戏里的绿叶岛和红云岛，又象征台湾、朝鲜。魔王则是杜鲁门。魔王治下的神仙谭格（原形臭虫）是坦克、费志（原形猫鹰头）是飞机、郝约（原形火箭）是火药、杜崇（原形毒虫）是瘟疫、黄宝（原形元宝）是金元，裘能是原子弹、麻岁（原形毒蛇）是教育、胡眉（原形狐狸）是外交。这些神仙们饱食终日，优哉游哉。终于在劳动人民的团结、觉醒和反抗下，全部消灭。…
    还有一类是采取比较慎重的态度处理这个题材的，大体上保留了原有神话的精神。这一种占数量最少，在北京我只看见过“首都实验评剧团”的演出，尽管他还存在许多缺点，这种演出，我认为是比较认真的。《广西戏曲》报十九期发表了秦似的《牛郎织女传》的写作经过，他是主张尽可能保留原有的神话的情节的，不曾看到演出，这里不谈。
    《牛郎织女》的神话，是中国人民的最好的文学创造之一，是我们民族的宝贵的遗产。历代许多诗人，都曾经为这个题材写过诗。这个神话的历史，就文字所记载，也已经有两千多年了。这个神话流布的地域，遍及全国。这个神话，虽然经过一些演变，各地所说的情节也不完全一样，但大体上可以分成两种：
    一、织女是天帝的第七个（一说第九个）孙女，在天河东面织云锦天衣，牛郎在天河西面看牛，两人都很勤勉，天帝爱怜他们，让他们结婚，婚后两人贪图逸乐，荒弃劳动，天帝发怒，使之分开，中间隔天河，命乌鸦去告诉他们七天见面一次，由于乌鸦传错了话，说成每年七月七日见面一次。
    二、织女是王母娘娘的外孙女，在天上织云彩，牛郎是人间的一个看牛郎，受兄嫂虐待，一天牛告诉他织女和别的仙女要到银河沐浴，叫他去取一件仙衣，织女找衣服的时候，他去还给她，并要求她和他结婚，她一定会答应，牛郎就照样做了。织女和牛郎结婚后，生一男一女。王母娘娘知道了，把织女捉回去，牛告诉了牛郎，他可以把它的皮披在身上，追到天上去。等牛郎挑了两个小孩追到天上时，王母娘娘拔下发簪在织女后面一划，就成天河，把这一对夫妻隔开了，但他们常常隔河相望啼泣，感动了王母娘娘，于是允许他们每年七月七日相会一次。相会时，由喜鹊架成桥。故《牛郎织女》的神话亦名《天河配》、《银河会》、《七巧姻缘》、《乞巧图》、《鹊桥相会》。
    这两种神话，情节虽然不同，但都是根据古代人民对于天上的星象的变化，结合了自己生活上的情节所产生的。从这两种传说看，我是比较喜欢第二种传说的。第一种传说所产生的情节，完全是天帝的安排，又反映了爱情和劳动是矛盾的，因此先有天帝的“恩赐”，后有天帝的惩罚。第二种传说，反映了中国古代的劳动人民对于幸福生活的渴望，对于婚姻生活的民主观念，但由于社会制度的限制，不可能美满的实现。王母娘娘的阻碍，象征中国封建宗法社会的压迫。这个传说，是一首极美的想像的诗，纯朴而又健康，所以它能如此久远地深入人心。
    爱惜这类神话并给以整理，使之更丰美，是文艺工作者的任务之一。像这一类神话，可以用各种形式去表现。但在改写的时候，希望能注意几点：
    一、严肃的对待民间传说，尽可能地保留原有传说中美丽的情节，不要破坏神话的纯朴的想像。爱惜我们民族的民间传说，爱惜长期流传在人民群众中的神话，是我们爱国主义精神的表现，也是一种群众观点。各个民族都有自己的神话传说，这些神话传说，是各民族的祖先对自然现象、人生经验、劳动、爱情、斗争的一些观念的组合。许多神话里，强烈地流露了我们祖先对于幸福生活的愿望和意志。许多神话里，都反映两种势力的矛盾：人和神，人和恶魔，以及人间的善与恶的矛盾，这些矛盾，就是阶级社会的矛盾。有的是人胜利了，有的是人失败了，有的德行胜利了，有的是罪恶胜利了，有的是调和妥协了，就构成喜剧和悲剧。当我们改编或是重写的时候，必须首先研究这些神话的演变，掌握它的基本精神。我们反对那种以轻率的态度处理民间传说的作风，反对把一个原来很美丽的神话加以任意宰割的野蛮行为。
    二、改写的时候必须把主题思想明确起来，把劳动、爱情、反封建这三种基本的观念强调起来。把牛郎和织女回复到劳动人民的本来面目。有的戏把织女写成像大家闺秀一样的多愁善感，把牛郎写成一个傻瓜。有的戏又把牛郎写成像一个书生，例如一个剧本里，牛郎上场时竟唱：“秋光如画白云飞，柳浪闻莺踏翠蹄，荷笠牧童牛背坐，无腔短笛唱斜晖。”这些都是一种对劳动人民的歪曲。牛郎和织女应该是勤劳、勇敢、富有理想，不然的话，他们怎能按照自己的意志创造生活：一个敢于违抗王母娘娘的权力，一个敢于和天仙女结婚？而当织女被召回天上去时，牛郎又怎么敢于追到天上去呢？
    三、神话虽然根据现实产生，但它并不完全是现实，它比现实赋有更多想像，假如把这些想像抽掉，或是不适当地强调现实，都会丧失神话的纯朴和天真的美。有人改写神话时，拘泥于细节的真实，忽略了创造这些神话的古代人民的基本观念。他们杜撰许多情节，把这些情节生硬地掺和在里面，使原有神话的线索完全模糊了，他们喜欢借任何一个人物的嘴，来发表一些危言耸听的所谓“哲理”。神话是人类幼年期的产物，它们虽然简单，甚至不合乎自然科学的常识，但它们常常是最本质地表现了古代社会的阶级矛盾，传达了古代人民的生活愿望，因此基本上是真实的、科学的、动人的。以普通的科学常识来衡量神话，结果只会把所有的神话都判处死刑。从自然科学的见地来说，既没有所谓“天河”，这条“天河”是由数不清的恒星所构成，牛郎和织女这两颗星也不会每年见一次面，它们之间的距离，至少有一万光年以上。但在我们祖先的创造里，王母娘娘的银簪一划而成天河，喜鹊搭桥使牛郎织女能见面！这是多么大胆的想像！
    我们必须尊重这些想像，再把它们互相抵触的部分，加以合理的解决（传说织女在银河洗澡，这样原来就有银河，后来又由王母娘娘划了一条银河，不是有两条银河了么？）使原有的情节更合乎人情，增添情节，也必须根据这些想像。假如把原有的许多想像都改变了，那就不妨另外写别的神话。
    四、我们不是一般地反对影射，我们反对完全不根据历史事实和原有传说的情节，随便加以牵强附会的许多所谓“暗喻”。象征，是文学表现手法的很重要的一个部分，但有些作者却凭空制造许多所谓“暗喻”，作者本人可能是煞费苦心，但观众看了只会感到莫名其妙。有一个剧本里，以牛车和牛结婚来“暗喻”生产工具和交换工具的结合，这是很令人费解的。
    有些人一写历史剧和神话剧，就想“借古喻今”，根据现在的需要，把历史事件的情节给以重新编造，或是借历史人物的嘴发表现代人的理论，或是在结尾上加添一点“暗喻”之类。今年年初，我曾看过景孤血写的封神榜的戏《姜子牙与哪叱》，全剧充满神怪魔法，最后姜子牙和申公豹斗争，申公豹变成一只纸老虎从天而降，被人戳穿，这样就是“戳穿纸老虎”，听说和抗美援朝有了联系。我们说文艺工作必须反映现实，必须连系实际，有的人把这个意思，理解成简单化、庸俗化了。他们以为连系实际，只是把每个时期的中心任务，像贴标语似的放到作品里去，完全不管那个作品写的是什么时间、地点、事件，因此把周文王时代也写成抗美援朝，实际上那时美洲新大陆还没有被发现呢！
    有的人对神话完全采取否定的态度，有的人以为神话就是迷信，这种看法是错误的。神话与迷信很容易混淆，但我们又必须把它们区别开来。我们所反对的，是那些鼓吹因果报应，以阴曹地府的酷刑，和阴森恐怖的鬼魅，来镇压人民反抗心理的宗教迷信；但这并不等于说我们要取消了想像。宗教迷信向人民进行反动教育，而好的神话则是启发人民合理的想像，对生活寄托以理想。当然，神话里常常掺杂了迷信的成分，在改写的时候要善于区别它们，把迷信的成分去掉。《牛郎织女》的演出里，牛神使用“点化术”，牛郎突然置身在豪绅家庭；牛郎和兄嫂分家后，兄嫂家里遭天火焚烧，这些是鼓励人完全依靠神来奖罚的，带有浓厚迷信色彩的部分，假如把它们删去，不但不会损害原有的神话，只会使这个传说更合理更单纯，更健康，也是更美。
    总之，《牛郎织女》是中国人民所熟悉与喜爱的神话，我们希望将来有比较完整的剧本出现。
