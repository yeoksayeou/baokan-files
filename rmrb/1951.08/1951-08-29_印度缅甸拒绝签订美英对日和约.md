　　India and Burma Refuse to Sign US-UK Treaty with Japan

The Indian government has notified the United States government, declaring its refusal to sign the draft final version of the US-UK prepared treaty with Japan, and therefore also refuses to attend the conference convened by the United States in San Francisco on September 4 to sign such a treaty with Japan. Prior to this, the Burmese government had announced its refusal to attend the San Francisco conference.

Regarding the US-UK governments' proposed draft final version of the treaty with Japan, which violates international agreements and prepares for new wars, and the San Francisco conference convened by the US government, which abandons international obligations and excludes the People's Republic of China, among the countries that oppose such a treaty with Japan, there may be two attitudes: one is to participate in the conference, put forward their own proposals for a treaty with Japan, and fight for this proposal; the other is to refuse to sign such a treaty, and therefore refuse to attend such a conference. The former is the attitude adopted by countries such as the Soviet Union, and the latter is the attitude adopted by countries such as India and Burma. Both attitudes are welcomed by the Chinese people.

The wise decisions of the Indian and Burmese governments undoubtedly reflect the will of the Asian people on the issue of peace with Japan, and will undoubtedly be welcomed by the people of all Asian countries.

In its note to the United States on August 23, the Indian government justly criticized the unreasonableness of the draft treaty with Japan unilaterally formulated by the United States. The note pointed out that the US draft deprives Japan of its sovereignty over the Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands, and stipulates that US occupation forces will continue to be stationed in Japan as part of Japan's concluded "defense agreements," thus violating Japan's legitimate rights and interests, and violating the desire of most Asian people for independence and autonomy. The US draft refuses to stipulate the return of Taiwan to China, and refuses to stipulate the return of the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin to the Soviet Union, thus violating the legitimate rights and interests of China and the Soviet Union, and directly violating the international agreements signed by the United States during World War II. No one can refute these accusations by the Indian government.

The imperialist governments of the United States and Britain once believed that they could disregard the will of the people of all countries who participated in the war against Japanese aggression, disregard the will of the people of all countries closely related to Japan, and arbitrarily create a peace conference with Japan and a treaty with Japan to force the people of all countries to accept. The actions of India and Burma, like the actions of the Soviet Union and China, prove that the era when these imperialist governments could do whatever they want is over.

Obviously, the shameless curses of the US imperialist spokesmen against the Indian note do not indicate their strength, but their isolation and helplessness. The US and British imperialists will, of course, use mechanical methods to order their American and European puppets, as well as Asian puppets such as Bao Dai, to "pass" their unmodifiable draft treaty, and veto the just treaty with Japan proposals that the Soviet Union will put forward, but they still cannot salvage their tragic failure in front of the whole world. Justice is not on their side, and this cannot be concealed at all.

The three most populous countries in the world stand against the US-UK draft treaty with Japan, and the total population of these three countries exceeds one billion. The people of Asia bravely oppose the Western imperialist bullies for the benefit of Asia, including Japan's interests. These two facts are of great significance. These two facts prove that the new direction of human history cannot be reversed by a few overbearing thugs. Even if the US-UK imperialists' treaty with Japan is signed, it will not bring them much, but will only bring greater anti-imperialist anger from the people of all countries.

### 印度缅甸拒绝签订美英对日和约

　　印度缅甸拒绝签订美英对日和约
    印度政府已经照会美国政府，声明拒绝签订美英两国所准备的对日和约草案定稿，因而也拒绝出席九月四日美国在旧金山召开的签订这样一个对日和约的会议。在这以前，缅甸政府已宣布了拒绝出席旧金山会议。
    对待美英两国政府所提出的破坏国际协定和准备新的战争的对日和约草案定稿与美国政府所召开的背弃国际义务而将中华人民共和国排斥在外的旧金山会议，在反对这样一个对日和约的国家中，本来可能有两种态度：一种是参加会议提出自己的对日和约建议并为此建议而奋斗；一种是拒绝签订这样一个和约，因而也就拒绝出席这样一个会议。前者是苏联等国家所采取的态度，后者是印度、缅甸等国家所采取的态度。这两种态度都是中国人民所欢迎的。
    印度政府和缅甸政府的明智的决定，无疑地反映了亚洲人民在对日媾和问题上的意志，无疑地将受到亚洲各国人民的欢迎。
    印度政府在八月二十三日给美国的照会中，公正地指责了美国所一手制订的对日和约草案的不合理。这个照会指明：美国的草案剥夺日本对于琉球和小笠原群岛的主权，又规定美国占领军将继续留驻日本作为日本缔结的“防御协定”的一部分，因此是违反日本的正当权益，并且是违反亚洲大部分人民要求独立自主的愿望的。美国的草案拒绝规定将台湾归还中国，拒绝规定将千岛群岛和南库页岛归与苏联，因此是违反中国和苏联的正当权益，并且是直接违反第二次世界大战期间美国所签订的国际协议的。印度政府的这些指责，任何人也不能加以辩驳。
    美国和英国的帝国主义政府曾经以为，它们可以不尊重参加反对日本侵略的各国人民的意志，不尊重与日本有密切关系的各国人民的意志，就可以专横地造出一个对日和会和一个对日和约来强迫各国人民接受。印度和缅甸的行动，跟苏联和中国的行动一样，证明这些帝国主义政府为所欲为的时代已经过去了。
    很明显，美国帝国主义代言人们对于印度照会的无耻的咒骂，不是表示他们的有力，而是表示他们的孤立无援。美英帝国主义者们当然会用机械的方法，命令他们的美洲、欧洲的傀儡以及保大之流的亚洲傀儡“通过”他们的不许修改的和约草案定本，而否决苏联所将提出的公正的对日和约建议，但是他们仍然无法挽救他们在全世界面前的悲惨失败。正义不在他们一方面，这是完全不能掩饰的了。
    世界上三个人口最多的国家站在反对美英对日和约草案的立场上，这三个国家的人口总数超过十万万。亚洲的人民勇敢地为包括日本利益在内的亚洲的利益而反对西方的帝国主义恶霸。这两个事实有极重大的意义。这两个事实证明人类历史的新方向不是少数逞强的暴徒所能够扭转的。美英帝国主义者的对日和约即使签订了，也不能使他们多得什么东西，而只能得到各国人民的更大的反帝国主义的愤怒。
