Explanation:
　　(1) Takashi Yamaguchi, acting as a special agent and spy for the US government, plotted to shell the Tiananmen review stand during the National Day celebration on October 1, 1950. Yamaguchi measured the terrain of Tiananmen in advance, drew a map, and marked the indicators for shooting at the Tiananmen review stand. This is the original draft drawn by Yamaguchi, and the original drawing has been sent to the US Occupation Army Headquarters in Tokyo.
　　(2) A letter from David Barrett, the commander of US government spies, to Li An-tung, dated November 29, 1949. The letter invites Li An-tung and Takashi Yamaguchi to meet at his place in West Biao Bei Hutong and praises Li An-tung for providing valuable intelligence. The letter reads:
　　Dear Tony:
　　Please come with Takashi Yamaguchi to my place in West Biao Bei Hutong for lunch at 12:45 PM on December 2nd. Mr. Colbert has accepted the invitation to come.
　　To save time and trouble, I will not send a separate invitation to Takashi Yamaguchi, please forgive me.
　　I am uneasy about you sending a child to deliver classified materials to me. Do you think this is okay? If someone takes a letter from your child, it will cause great trouble for both of us.
　　These materials are extremely valuable, and I am very happy to receive them.
　　Sincerely,
　　David
　　Enclosed is a check, please give it to Katherine.
　　(3) Li An-tung's letter of service to the US government's espionage agency. This is the draft of the letter he wrote to Colonel David Barrett on November 11, 1948. The letter reads:
　　Dear Colonel Barrett:
　　From our exchange of political views over the years, I believe you can attest to the consistency of my anti-communist stance.
　　The problem of communism has now become a matter of universal importance, to the point that it may need to be resolved by war. Today, the anti-communist world looks to the United States for leadership, and I am willing to serve the United States with all my strength.
　　I would be grateful if you could forward this letter to the relevant authorities for consideration. Thank you in advance, dear Colonel Barrett.
　　Your faithful,
　　Li An-tung
　　(4) A letter from David Barrett, the commander of US government spies, to Li An-tung. The letter reads:
　　Tony: Be sure to burn these after you are done with them. I don't want anyone outside of your family, especially your servants, to know that you have these.
　　The import rules will be sent to you immediately.
　　Sincerely,
　　David

美国特务间谍阴谋暴动的罪证
      说明：
    （一）充当美国政府特务间谍的山口隆一阴谋于一九五○年十月一日我国国庆大典时炮击天安门检阅台。山口隆一事前测量天安门的形势，绘制成图，并划出射击天安门检阅台的指标。这是山口隆一所绘的原稿，正图已寄往东京美国占领军总部。
    （二）美国政府间谍的指挥者包瑞德在一九四九年十一月二十九日写给李安东的信。信中是邀请李安东和山口隆一到西裱褙胡同见面，并且称赞李安东供给他的情报材料很有价值。信中说：亲爱的汤尼：
    请你和山口隆一于十二月二日十二点四十五分到西裱褙胡同我处午餐。柯乐柏先生已接受邀请前来。
    为了节省时间和麻烦，我不另给山口隆一请帖，请他原谅我。
    你派小孩子送分类材料给我，我很不安，你觉得这样可以吗？万一有人将一封信从你的小孩子那里拿去，就会给我们两个人惹下天大的麻烦。
    这些材料极有价值，我非常高兴得到他。
                          诚恳的

    现在共产主义问题，已经成为一个具有普遍重要性的问题，以至可能需要以战争来解决。今天反共世界均向美国寻求领导，我很愿意为美国全力效劳。
    如蒙将这封信转交主管当局予以考虑，我将感激不尽。预先谢谢你，亲爱的包瑞德上校。
                          你的忠实的

                                诚恳地
