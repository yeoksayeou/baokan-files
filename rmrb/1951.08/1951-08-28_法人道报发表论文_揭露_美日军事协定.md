　　Xinhua News Agency, August 27th, TASS, Paris, August 26th: *L'Humanité* published an article entitled "The Significance of the U.S.-Japan Military Agreement," stating: According to reliable sources in the United States, the U.S. Department of Defense and the State Department are currently drafting a bilateral U.S.-Japan military agreement, which the United States hopes to sign simultaneously with the peace treaty with Japan.

　　This agreement will apparently include the following points: First, U.S. ground forces, naval forces, and air forces will be stationed indefinitely in and around Japan. These forces will consist of the current occupying forces stationed in Japan (including naval and air forces). U.S. military personnel will enjoy extraterritorial rights. The cost of maintaining the U.S. garrison will be shared equally by Japan and the United States. Second, the Japanese government will hand over both permanent and non-permanent military bases to the United States for use. The bases will be handed over to the United States for use for twenty to twenty-five years, and this period can be extended with the consent of both parties. Third, the United States will enjoy the following rights: The United States will enjoy sovereignty, construction rights, and surveying rights in the base locations. The United States has complete freedom of action around the base, rights of surveying and construction; ground forces can move freely; warships and aircraft also enjoy freedom of action in Japanese territorial waters and airspace; the United States can freely transport war materials and equipment without paying customs duties and other taxes; for military purposes, the United States has the right to use seaports, airports, railways, highways, and arsenals, as well as to conduct military reconnaissance, including reconnaissance of the coast, surveying terrain, aerial photography, and measuring waterways.

　　In addition, the U.S.-Japan military agreement will include several secret special clauses. The aforementioned person specifically pointed out that one of the clauses stipulates that after the signing of the peace treaty, the Japanese government should closely cooperate with the U.S. government in all aspects of military, political, and economic activities in the Far East.

　　In addition, when necessary, Japan must establish at least thirty infantry divisions for the United States, and put Japan's naval and air forces and its entire war industry potential at the disposal of the United States. There is also a secret clause stipulating that Japan's military policy will be subject to the instructions and manipulation of the U.S. Command. In order to avoid causing dissatisfaction among the Japanese people, the U.S. Occupation Forces Command in Japan will be moved from Tokyo to Yokohama and renamed the U.S. Forces Japan Command.

　　法人道报发表论文  揭露“美日军事协定”
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十六日讯：《人道报》以《美日军事协定的意义》为题发表论文说：据可靠的美国人士消息称：美国国防部和国务院目前正在拟定美日双边军事协定，美国希望这个协定能与对日和约同时签订。
    这个协定显然将包括下列各点：第一，美国的地面部队、海军和空军将无限期地驻在日本和日本附近的地方。这些军队将由目前驻在日本的占领军（包括海军及空军在内）组成。美国军人将享受治外法权。维持美国驻军的费用将由日美两国平均负担。第二，日本政府将把永久性的和非永久性的两种军事基地交给美国使用。基地将交给美国使用二十年至二十五年，这个期限经双方同意后仍能予以延长。第三，美国将享有下列几种权利：美国在基地所在地享有主权、建筑和勘测权。在基地周围美国有完全自由行动，勘测和建筑的权利；地面部队可以自由活动；军舰和飞机在日本领海、领空也享有自由活动的权利；美国并可以自由运输战争物资及装备而不必缴纳关税和其他捐税；为了军事的目的，美国有使用海港、机场、铁路、公路和兵工厂以及进行军事侦察的权利，包括侦察海岸、测量地势、空中摄影，和测量水路等权利。
    此外，美日军事协定将包括若干秘密的特别条款。上述人士特别指出：其中一项条款规定日本政府在签订和约以后，应与美国政府在远东的一切军事、政治和经济活动各方面密切合作。
    另外，在必要的时候日本必须为美国建立至少三十个步兵师，并且把日本的海军和空军以及它的整个战争工业的潜力交给美国使用。还有一项秘密条款，规定日本的军事政策将受美国司令部的指示和操纵。为了避免引起日本人民的不满起见，美国驻日占领军司令部将从东京移至横滨，并将改名为驻日美军司令部。
