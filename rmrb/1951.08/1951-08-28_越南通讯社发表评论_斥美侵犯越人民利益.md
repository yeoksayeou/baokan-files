Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, the Vietnam News Agency published a commentary on the 24th stating that the French colonialists and the Bảo Đại puppet have absolutely no right to represent the Vietnamese people in discussing the so-called "peace treaty with Japan."

The commentary said: The US imperialists recently notified the Bảo Đại puppet, agreeing to Bảo Đại puppet sending representatives to San Francisco to sign their so-called "peace treaty with Japan." The US imperialists have once again shamelessly sold out the interests of the Asian people who shed blood in the struggle to defeat Japanese fascism.

Everyone knows that the Bảo Đại clique, which has now become a puppet of the French and US imperialists, used to be a running dog of Japanese fascism. They helped the Japanese oppress and exploit the Vietnamese people and suppress the Vietnamese people's liberation movement. Bảo Đại—known throughout the world as "the emperor picked up from the garbage heap"—represents only a small group of traitors and their French and US imperialist masters.

The US imperialists' allowing the Bảo Đại puppet to send representatives to the San Francisco conference is a shameless infringement on the interests of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people fought heroically against Japanese fascism when the French colonialists, headed by de Gaulle, and the Bảo Đại puppet cooperated closely with the Japanese. The US imperialists also showed their vicious intention to turn Vietnam into a military base for aggression against the People's Republic of China. The representatives of the French colonialists and the Bảo Đại puppet who participated in the San Francisco conference will not only sign the illegal "peace treaty" with Japan drafted by the warmonger Dulles, but also accept the orders of the US imperialists to intensify the transformation of Indochina into a war base in the Far East.

The Vietnamese people denounce them and will fight to the end to smash the aggressive conspiracies of the French and US imperialists. The Vietnamese people warmly support Foreign Minister Hoàng Minh Giám's statement of July 20, 1951, regarding the peace treaty with Japan. Only the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the legitimate representative of the Vietnamese people, and the French colonialists and the Bảo Đại puppet have absolutely no right to speak on behalf of the Vietnamese people in discussions on the peace treaty with Japan.

　　越南通讯社发表评论
    斥美侵犯越人民利益
    【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯。越南通讯社于二十四日发表评论声明：法国殖民者与保大傀儡绝对无权代表越南人民讨论所谓“对日和约”。
    评论说：美帝国主义者最近通知保大傀儡，同意保大傀儡派遣代表到旧金山签订他们所谓的“对日和约”。美帝国主义者又一次无耻地出卖了在击败日本法西斯主义的斗争中流过鲜血的亚洲人民的利益。
    每一个人都知道，现在成了法、美帝国主义者傀儡的保大集团，曾经做过日本法西斯的走狗，他们曾帮助日本人压迫与剥削越南人民，并镇压越南人民的解放运动。保大——全世界都知道他是“从垃圾堆里捡起来的皇帝”——只代表一小撮的卖国贼和他们的法美帝国主义者主子。
    美帝国主义者允许保大傀儡派遣代表参加旧金山会议，是无耻地侵犯了越南人民的利益。当以戴古为首的法国殖民者与保大傀儡与日本人密切合作的时候，越南人民曾向日本法西斯英勇战斗。美帝国主义者还表现了想把越南变为侵略中华人民共和国军事基地的恶毒用心。法国殖民者与保大傀儡参加旧金山会议的代表，不仅要签订非法的由战争贩子杜勒斯起草的对日“和约”，而且还要接受美帝国主义者的命令，加紧把印度支那变为远东的战争基地。
    越南人民痛斥他们，并将为粉碎法、美帝国主义者的侵略阴谋而斗争到底。越南人民热烈拥护黄明鉴外长一九五一年七月二十日关于对日和约的声明，唯有越南民主共和国政府才是越南人民的合法代表，而法国殖民者与保大傀儡绝对无权代表越南人民在讨论对日和约上发言。
