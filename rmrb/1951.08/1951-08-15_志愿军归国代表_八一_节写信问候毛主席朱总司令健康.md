　　Volunteer Army Returning Representatives Write Letter on "August 1st" Army Day to Greet Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Wishing Them Good Health
　　Respected Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
　　We extend our warm congratulations on the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and send our regards to you, wishing you good health.
　　Under the help and guidance of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, we have carried out propaganda work for resisting America and aiding Korea. During the propaganda process, we saw the widespread development of the motherland's movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, and we saw the brilliant achievements made by the movement.
　　In the movement to resist America and aid Korea, all democratic parties and fraternal ethnic groups, under the banner of Chairman Mao, showed unprecedented solidarity and contributed everything to resist America and aid Korea. The working class, in order to support the front lines, launched a patriotic production competition, creating new production records. The vast rural areas successfully completed land reform, and the peasants launched a bumper harvest movement. A large number of young intellectuals joined military cadre schools, adding new strength to the motherland's national defense construction. Merchants also launched a movement to donate airplanes and cannons, completing tax tasks ahead of schedule. Many children became little heroes in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries by capturing spies. The religious community also participated in the vigorous marches and demonstrations to resist America and aid Korea. The people on the grasslands and borders of the motherland also set off a patriotic upsurge, responding to all the calls of the motherland. This is the victory of the Party's leadership, and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The in-depth development of the movement to resist America and aid Korea has united the people as never before, which is the combat force for winning the war and defending world peace.
　　The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has learned the heroic behavior of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in being loyal to the motherland. The support of the people of the motherland has further encouraged us. We must convey the situation of the motherland to the front lines, continue to fight for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, for the defense of the motherland and world peace, and strive for the final victory in resisting America and aiding Korea.
　　Respectfully wishing
　　You good health!
　　Volunteer Army Returning Representatives: Chai Chuanruo, Ji Bingqian, Gao Chao, Wang Yougen, Dong Lefu, Li Weiying, Wang Jianhun, Li Jitao, Zhang Fu, Dou Shaoyi.

　　志愿军归国代表“八一”节写信问候毛主席朱总司令健康
    敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    我们以热烈的心情祝贺中国人民解放军建军二十四周年，并问候您们的健康。
    我们在中国人民抗美援朝总会的帮助与指导之下，进行了抗美援朝的宣传工作。在宣传过程中，我们看到祖国的抗美援朝保家卫国运动的广泛展开，看到了运动所取得的辉煌成就。
    在抗美援朝运动中，各民主党派、兄弟民族在毛主席的旗帜下，更表现了空前的巩固团结，并为抗美援朝贡献出一切。工人阶级为了支援前线，掀起了爱国主义生产竞赛的热潮，创造了新的生产纪录。广大农村胜利完成了土地改革，农民们开展了丰产运动。青年知识分子大批参加军事干部学校，使祖国的国防建设增加了新的力量。商人们也开展了捐献飞机大炮的运动，提早完成税收任务。许多小孩子在镇压反革命运动中捉特务当了小英雄。宗教界也参加了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝游行示威。祖国的草原上和边疆上的人民也都掀起爱国的热潮，响应祖国的一切号召。这是党领导的胜利，是毛主席思想的伟大胜利。抗美援朝运动的深入开展，使人民空前团结了，这是取得战争胜利，保卫世界和平的战斗力量。
    中国人民志愿军学习了中国人民解放军忠于祖国的英雄行为。祖国人民的支援更加鼓舞了我们。我们一定要把祖国的情形转告前线，为争取和平解决朝鲜问题，为保卫祖国与世界和平继续战斗，争取抗美援朝的最后胜利。
        敬祝
    您们身体健康！
