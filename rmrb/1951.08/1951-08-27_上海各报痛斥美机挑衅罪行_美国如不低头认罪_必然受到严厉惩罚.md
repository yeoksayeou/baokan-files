Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 25th: Shanghai's Xinwen Ribao, Dagong Bao, and Wenhui Bao published commentaries on the 24th, unanimously denouncing the United States aircraft's treacherous and shameless act of bombing and strafing the Kaesong neutral zone meeting site, and issuing a stern warning to U.S. imperialism.

　　Xinwen Ribao's editorial, titled "Our Patience is Limited!" said: The U.S. aircraft are now going a step further and singling out the Kaesong meeting site as a target for bombing and strafing, attempting to assassinate our delegation, which proves 100% that the U.S. side has no regard for the neutral zone and is deliberately seeking provocation and challenges. We can no longer tolerate the U.S. side's rogue and shameless attitude. The editorial said: "We must warn the U.S. side: Do not mistake our sincere desire for peaceful negotiations for weakness and vulnerability. The Chinese and Korean people are already filled with righteous indignation at the U.S. side's arrogant demands regarding the military demarcation line, and the shameless atrocities of destroying the Kaesong neutral zone and injuring our military police. Our patience cannot be unlimited. The U.S. side must clearly understand: We are actively striving for peace, but we are by no means begging for peace from U.S. imperialists; if we cannot achieve peace through negotiations, we understand and are capable of continuing to win peace through the struggle against aggression."

　　Dagong Bao's editorial pointed out: The ferocious and shameless behavior of U.S. imperialism is unprecedented in world history. This is a serious challenge to the Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world! If the American robbers do not admit their guilt and sincerely repent, they will inevitably be severely punished!

　　Wenhui Bao's editorial said: This act of U.S. imperialism shows that it is deliberately sabotaging the negotiations, which is a blatant challenge to peace! The newspaper pointed out: "The Chinese and Korean people are prepared and confident. If the U.S. imperialists dare to quibble and prevaricate, we will take practical actions to curb this shameless provocation against peace!"

　　上海各报痛斥美机挑衅罪行
    美国如不低头认罪
    必然受到严厉惩罚
    【新华社上海二十五日电】上海新闻日报、大公报、文汇报二十四日发表评论，一致痛斥美国飞机轰炸扫射开城中立区会址地区的背信弃义的无耻行为，并向美帝国主义提出严重警告。
    新闻日报社评题为：“我们的忍耐是有限度的！”社评说：美国飞机现在竟进一步挑选开城会址区作为投弹扫射的目标，企图杀害我方代表团，这更百分之百地证明美方目无中立区，蓄意寻衅挑战。对于美方这种无赖无耻的态度，我方实属忍无可忍。社评说：“我们必须警告美方：不要错把我方耐心谈判停战的诚意认为软弱可欺，中朝人民对于美方关于军事分界线的狂妄要求，破坏开城中立区杀伤我军事警察的无耻暴行，已经义愤填膺，我方的忍耐不能是没有限度的。美方要认识清楚：我方是积极争取和平，而绝不是向美帝国主义者乞求和平；如果我们不能经过谈判而争得和平，我们是懂得和能够继续用反侵略的斗争来赢得和平的。”
    大公报社评指出：美帝国主义这种凶恶无耻的行为，是世界历史所未有的。这是对中朝人民以及世界爱好和平人民的严重挑战！美国强盗若不低头认罪，若不诚心改过，必然要受到严厉的惩罚！
    文汇报社论说：美帝国主义这一行为说明了它蓄意破坏谈判，这是对和平的公然的挑战！该报指出：“中朝人民是有准备、有信心的，如果美帝国主义者胆敢狡赖巧饰，我们将以实际行动来遏止这种无耻的、对和平的挑衅行为！”
