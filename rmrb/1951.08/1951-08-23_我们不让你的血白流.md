We Will Not Let Your Blood Be Shed in Vain
    By our reporter, Lu Chaoqi

　　In Kaesong, the Chinese and Korean people and soldiers, filled with grief and indignation, mourned Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang, who was murdered by the American and Syngman Rhee bandit troops.

　　Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang was an outstanding fighter for peace, having earned three military merits on the Korean front. He was murdered by the American and Syngman Rhee bandit troops who were sabotaging the Kaesong neutral zone while he was on guard duty in the Kaesong neutral zone. On the morning of August 19, as Platoon Leader Yao and Deputy Platoon Leader Li Jinglin led a squad patrolling eastward along the ridge of Zengshandong, Songgok-ri, and Balsan-ri, they were suddenly attacked by dozens of American and Syngman Rhee bandit troops who had illegally entered the neutral zone and ambushed them in the forests of the high ground near the mountain road between Songgok-ri and Balsan-ri. He and soldier Wang Renyuan were both seriously wounded in the left leg by bullets. Wang Renyuan endured the pain and crawled into a pile of firewood. Soldier Ge Wenju ran to Platoon Leader Yao, wanting to carry him back. Platoon Leader Yao, fearing that the soldier would be injured, waved his hand and said to him, "Don't worry about me, hide quickly, the enemy's fire is very dense..." At this time, the enemy rushed to Platoon Leader Yao, shooting him twice in the forehead, killing him, and stealing his pistol, pen, watch, diary, and the shoes on his feet.

　　The news of Platoon Leader Yao's heroic sacrifice for the cause of peace aroused infinite grief and indignation among the people and soldiers of Kaesong. On the afternoon of the 19th, when our delegation, General Xie Fang and General Li Xiangchao, went to pay their respects to the remains of martyr Yao Qingxiang, soldier Ge Wenju said indignantly: "We saw very clearly that the enemy's formation in the charge was very dense. At the closest point, they were only seven or eight meters away from us. If we had counterattacked, my submachine gun alone could have taken out at least half of them. To be honest, if it weren't for striving for peace in Asia, we wouldn't have let a single one of them escape." When our volunteer soldiers are fighting the enemy, one of them can repel the attack of many enemies; but when they are carrying out the task of military police in the Kaesong neutral zone, they did not counterattack when the enemy attacked the neutral zone; in order to ensure the smooth progress of the peace talks, they tolerated it. However, when Platoon Leader Yao's body was brought back, the soldiers in the platoon were all so saddened that they shed tears. Many local farmers also cried. Some people did not eat for half a day to express their mourning for the martyr and their protest against the American and Syngman Rhee bandit troops.

　　The morning of August 20. People from all walks of life in Kaesong City held a memorial meeting for Martyr Yao Qingxiang. Representatives of workers, students, women, and the military police forces of China and Korea came to pay their respects to the martyr with flowers and elegies. Park Bong-chun, a representative of the people from all walks of life in Kaesong City, swore to the martyr: "We will not let your blood be shed in vain. We will work more actively, work hard to produce, support the Chinese and Korean People's Forces, and strive for the realization of peace in Korea." A primary school teacher, Liang Fanji, said: "The Kaesong Conference has been going on for more than a month, and American imperialism has no sincerity at all. Yesterday, the American and Syngman Rhee bandit troops broke into the neutral zone again and killed our Platoon Leader Yao. Every Kaesong person is very angry. This morning, in order to mourn Platoon Leader Yao, I went everywhere to find flowers. There were two big flowers blooming in an old lady's yard. I said to the old lady: I am looking for two flowers to dedicate to Platoon Leader Yao, who sacrificed for peace. She said: Pick them and dedicate them to Platoon Leader Yao, and also express my condolences to him. She also said that she would contribute her strength in the future to support the People's Army and the Volunteer Army. This is the will of our Korean people to love peace and defend peace."

　　我们不让你的血白流
    本报记者  陆超琪
    在开城的中、朝军民满怀悲愤的心情，哀悼遭美李匪军杀害的姚庆祥排长。
    姚庆祥排长是一个出色的和平斗士，在朝鲜前线曾经立过了三次战功。他是在担任开城中立区警卫任务时，被破坏开城中立区的美李匪军杀害的。八月十九日早晨，正当姚排长和李景林副排长率领一个班沿着甑山洞、松谷里、钵山里山岭向东巡逻，行至松谷里与钵山里之间山道附近的高地西坡时，突然遭到非法侵入中立区埋伏在该高地丛林中的数十名美李匪军的袭击。他和战士王仁元两人的左腿中弹负重伤。王仁元忍着痛楚，爬到柴草堆中。战士葛文举跑到姚排长跟前，想把他背回来。姚排长深怕这位战士受伤，摆着手对他说：“不要管我，你快隐蔽起来，敌人的火力很密……”这时，敌军冲到姚排长跟前，向他前额一连射击两枪，将他杀死，并且抢走了他的手枪、钢笔、手表、日记本和脚上的鞋子。
    姚排长为和平事业而壮烈牺牲的消息，引起开城军民无限悲愤。十九日下午，当我方代表团解方将军及李相朝将军亲赴姚庆祥烈士遗体停放处致哀时，战士葛文举愤慨地说：“我们看得清清楚楚，敌人冲锋的队形很密，最近的时候，离我们只有七八米远。如果还击，光是我那只冲锋枪，至少也干掉它一半。老实说，要不是为了争取亚洲和平，管叫敌人一个也跑不掉。”我们的志愿军战士在和敌人作战时，他们一个人可以击退多数敌人的进攻；但在担任开城中立区的军事警察任务时，在敌人袭击中立区时，他们并没有还击；为了使和平谈判能顺利进行，他们忍让了。但是，当着姚排长的遗体运回来的时候，排上的战士们都难过得流下泪来。当地许多农民也哭起来了。有的人半天没有吃饭，以表示他们对烈士的哀悼与对美李匪军的抗议。
    八月二十日上午。开城市各界人民，集会追悼姚庆祥烈士。工人、学生、妇女和中朝军事警察部队的代表，手持鲜花和挽词，来到烈士灵前致敬。开城市各界人民代表朴逢春向烈士宣誓：“我们不让你的血白流，我们要更加积极工作，努力生产，支援中朝人民部队，为实现朝鲜和平而奋斗。”一位小学教员梁范技说：“开城会议已开了一个多月，美帝国主义一点没有诚意。在昨天美李匪军又闯进中立区，杀害了我们的姚排长。每一个开城人都很气愤。今天早晨为了追悼姚排长，我到处去找鲜花，有一家老太太的院子里正开着两朵大鲜花。我对老太太说：我正要找两朵花献给为和平而牺牲的姚排长。她说：你摘去献给姚排长吧，也表示我对他的哀悼。她还说，以后要贡献自己的力量，支援人民军和志愿军，这就是我们朝鲜人民热爱和平保卫和平的意志”。（附图片）
