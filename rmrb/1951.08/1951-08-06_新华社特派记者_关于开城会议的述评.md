　　Commentary on the Kaesong Meeting
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th] This agency's special correspondent's commentary on the Kaesong meeting: Since July 26th, the Korean armistice negotiation meeting has remained stuck on the discussion of establishing a military demarcation line and establishing a demilitarized zone. According to authoritative sources: on the one hand, the US side's representatives unreasonably rejected our side's reasonable proposal to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line between the two sides; on the other hand, they absurdly proposed to establish the military demarcation line north of the 38th parallel, ahead of the US military's current battle line, and deep within our military's positions. The absurd and unreasonable demand made by the US side's representatives is almost unbelievable to the general public. According to information obtained by this reporter from relevant sources: if this military demarcation line proposed by the US side were adopted, our side would have to withdraw 30 to 60 kilometers north from the current battle line east of the Imjin River, giving up approximately 3,500 square kilometers of territory; west of the Imjin River, our side would have to withdraw 2,000 to 3,000 square kilometers. Our side's representatives advocate establishing a fair and reasonable military demarcation line based on fair and reasonable principles, resolutely opposing any US demand to establish a military demarcation line north of the 38th parallel, and even more resolutely opposing establishing a military demarcation line on the current battle line, let alone this absurd and unreasonable demand that is far north of the current battle line. It is said that the US side's representatives made such an absurd demand based on two reasons: one is that the US side relies on its superior naval and air forces, and if its naval and air forces are to withdraw from the air and sea of North Korea, then it must obtain compensation when demarcating the demilitarized zone on land; the other is to establish good defensive positions on favorable terrain to ensure the safety of the troops and prevent the occurrence of "aggression." These absurd and untenable reasons of the US side's representatives have been sternly refuted by our side's representatives. At the same time, our side's representatives have repeatedly clarified that it is fair, reasonable, and feasible to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, and solemnly pointed out that if the US side's representatives have the sincerity to negotiate, they should consider accepting this fair and reasonable proposal.
　　At the beginning of this armistice negotiation, both sides expressed their sincere desire for peace. Therefore, when discussing the military demarcation line for the armistice, both sides should proceed based on the principles that are both in line with the current military reality and conducive to the final peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The proposal of our side's representatives to insist on using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line between the two sides is serious and based on the above-mentioned principles; while the absurd demands made by the US side do not conform to the current military reality and lack a sincere goodwill for peace.
　　The current actual situation on the Korean battlefield is that the battle lines of both sides fluctuate in the north and south of the 38th parallel, and the military forces of both sides are close to equilibrium near the 38th parallel. This military force is the sum of all forces, including the naval and air forces. However, the US side's representatives ignore this military reality and unilaterally emphasize that its naval and air forces are independent and decisive military forces. Therefore, they propose to calculate this force when demarcating the demilitarized zone on land and to obtain additional compensation. Anyone with a little military knowledge knows that the theory of treating the naval and air forces as independent military forces has long been bankrupt. This has been proven by modern war history and irrefutably proven by the thirteen-month-long Korean War. If the naval and air forces could play a decisive role as an independent military force, then why didn't the United States achieve victory when it first sent its naval and air forces to participate in the Korean War at the beginning of the war last year, and why did it have to send ground troops to rescue them later? Since the US military had superior naval and air forces, why did it retreat to the Nakdong River in the early stage of the war, and later retreat from the Yalu River all the way south to the south of the Han River? MacArthur, who was dismissed from his post due to defeat, has helplessly admitted that "air support can only be used as an auxiliary force, and not as a decisive force." "The navy's bombardment capability is also narrowly limited to the borders of the coast and cannot reach the main battlefield." It is precisely because the US military is using such an auxiliary force, and the Chinese and Korean People's Armies have not yet used this auxiliary force, that the US-ROK forces can barely temporarily maintain this unstable battle line in some areas north of the 38th parallel. If the US military could not even use this auxiliary force, or if the Korean and Chinese People's Armies also used this auxiliary force, then even this unstable battle line of the US-ROK forces would vanish. What should be pointed out is that the power of the naval and air forces boasted by the US side's representatives has little practical effect in military terms, but it has had a great effect on destroying peaceful towns and villages in Korea and killing Korean women and children. The indiscriminate bombing of towns and villages in northern Korea by the US Air Force since July 10th is a recent new bloody crime. The US side's representatives participating in the armistice negotiations in Kaesong have shamelessly regarded this most brutal and barbaric criminal act of the US naval and air forces as a military force worthy of their boasting, and absurdly and shamelessly used it as a basis for coercing our side to accept their arrogant demands. This is not only resolutely opposed by the Korean and Chinese people, but also unanimously opposed by peace-loving people all over the world.
　　People know that the meeting currently being held in Kaesong is a solemn Korean armistice negotiation meeting, and both sides should only consider how to stop the war, stop the bloodshed, and be conducive to the attainment of peace in Korea. Our side's representatives correctly believe that the withdrawal of armed forces from the 38th parallel and the establishment of a demilitarized zone is the foundation for achieving an armistice in Korea. Malik put forward this peace proposal and believed that this price was not too high to ensure peace in Korea. The Chinese and Korean people 100% support this proposal, and the representatives of our side participating in the armistice negotiations also faithfully respect this principle. But the US side's representatives are thinking about how to establish advantageous and good "defensive" positions. For this, they also want to choose their "defensive" positions north of the 38th parallel, deep within our military's area. American aggressors are accustomed to establishing their own "defensive" lines on the territory of other countries. The word "defense" is a synonym for aggression to American aggressors, which is known to all. Therefore, people should expose this conspiracy of the US side's representatives. It attempts to use the armistice negotiations to obtain positions that cannot be obtained by force and to plan for renewed war. The US side's representatives use the excuse of ensuring the safety of troops to cover up its aggressive essence. They shamelessly describe their own aggressive conspiracy as preventing the occurrence of "aggression." Who exactly is the aggressor? Is it the Chinese and Korean people defending their homeland who are invading the United States, or is it the US government that sends troops thousands of miles away to invade other countries' territories and disrupt the peaceful lives of its people that is invading China and Korea? This simplest fact cannot be changed by the American representatives who attempt to confuse black and white. Recently, the US side has stated that it does not agree to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line. It is said that this is again a "political" issue. As everyone knows, the 38th parallel is by no means the boundary line of Korean territory. The 38th parallel is a military demarcation line drawn by the Soviet and American troops during the war against Japan in order to carry out military tasks. Therefore, it is naturally beyond reproach to use it as a military demarcation line during the Korean armistice. The reason why the US side wants to raise this shield of "political issues that cannot be discussed" again is to try to force our side to yield to their arrogant and unreasonable demands. The Chinese and Korean people have always advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Our side's representatives have made concessions on the issues of reporters' interviews, neutral zones, and troop withdrawals. The American aggressors, who have tasted the sweetness, regard our side's sincerity for peace as weakness and forbearance, and thus become more and more greedy, even making absurd and unreasonable territorial demands. That is a big mistake. This wishful thinking of the US side's representatives will only fail, and their policy of lacking sincerity and delaying time in the negotiations will inevitably arouse strong opposition from people all over the world, and will also arouse greater dissatisfaction among the US-ROK soldiers on the front lines. According to incomplete statistics, since July 10th, nearly 10,000 more US-ROK soldiers have become futile victims in the offensive. The US-ROK soldiers are eagerly hoping to stop the war and return to their homes, while the US side's representatives sitting at the Kaesong meeting on behalf of Washington still have war in mind and have not yet shown concrete sincerity for peace.

    关于开城会议的述评
    【新华社开城五日电】本社特派记者对开城会议的述评：从七月二十六日以来，朝鲜停战谈判会议还一直停留在关于确立军事分界线建立非军事区问题的讨论上。据权威方面消息：美方代表一方面无理地拒绝了我方以三八线为双方军事分界线的合理建议，另一方面又荒谬地提出要把军事分界线建立在三八线以北，美军目前战线前面，深入我军阵地以内。美方代表所提出的这项荒唐无理的要求几乎为一般人所不能置信。据记者从有关方面获悉：如果依据美方这条军事分界线，将使我方在临津江以东，从现在战线向北撤退三十至六十公里，即放弃约三千五百方公里的地区；在临津江以西，我方要退出二千至三千方公里。我方代表主张以公平合理的原则确立双方军事分界线，既坚决反对美方任何在三八线以北建立军事分界线的要求，更坚决反对在目前战线建立军事分界线，更何况尚远在目前战线以北的这个荒唐无理的要求。据说：美方代表之提出如此荒唐的要求是根据两个理由：一个是美方自恃海空军占优势，如果要它的海空军从朝鲜北部的空中和海上撤退，那就要在陆上划分非军事区时取得补偿；另一个要在有利的地形上建立良好的防御阵地，以保证部队的安全，和防止“侵略”的发生。美方代表这些荒唐无稽的理由已受到我方代表的严正驳斥，同时我方代表又再三阐明以三八线作为军事分界线的公平合理切实可行，并郑重指出：美方代表如有和谈诚意，就应当考虑接受这个公平合理的建议。
    在这次停战谈判的开初，双方都表示要有真诚和平的愿望，因此，在讨论停战的军事分界线时，双方就应当根据既合于目前军事实际、又利于最后和平解决朝鲜问题的原则来进行。我方代表所坚持主张的以三八线为双方军事分界线的建议，即是认真的、从上述原则出发的；而美方所提出的荒唐要求，既不合乎目前军事实际，又缺乏对和平的真诚善意。
    目前朝鲜战场的实际情况，是双方的战线流动于三八线南北地区，双方的军事力量在三八线附近接近于平衡，而这种军事力量是一切力量的总和，其中也包括了海空军的力量。美方代表却漠视这个军事实际，片面地强调它的海空军是独立的有决定性的军事力量，因此提出在陆地上划分非军事地区时要把这个力量计算进去，要取得额外的补偿。凡是略有军事常识的人都知道，把海空军作为独立的军事力量的理论是早已破产了的。这是为现代战史所证明、也为十三个月的朝鲜战争所无可置辩地证明了的。假如海空军是可以起决定作用的独立的军事力量，那末，去年朝鲜战争开始时，美国首先派了海空军参战，为什么没有取得胜利，后来又非派陆军去援救不行呢？美军既然有了优势的海空军，为什么在战争初期退到了洛东江，后来又从鸭绿江边一直退到了汉江以南呢？因战败而被撤职的麦克阿瑟，已经无可奈何地承认：空军的支援“只能作为一个辅助的力量，而不能作为一个具有决定性的力量”。“海军的轰击能力也仅狭隘的限于海岸的边界，不能达到主要的战场上”。正是因为在美国的陆军使用着这样的一个辅助的力量，而中朝人民军队尚未使用这个辅助力量的情况下美李军在三八线以北部分地区才能勉强地暂时地保持住目前这一条不稳固的战线。假如美军连这个辅助力量都使用不上了，或者是朝中人民军队也使用了这个辅助力量，那么，美李军就连这条不稳固的战线也就化为乌有了。更应该指出的是：美方代表所吹嘘的海空军的威力，在军事上实际并无多大作用，只是在对毁灭朝鲜和平城镇和杀害朝鲜妇女、儿童上却有了极大的效果。自七月十日以来，美国空军对朝鲜北部城乡的滥施轰炸，正是最近的一个新的血腥罪行。在开城参加停战谈判的美方代表却把美国海空军这种最残暴、最野蛮的罪恶行为当成值得自己夸耀的军事力量，并且荒谬无耻地以之作为要挟我方接受其狂妄要求的根据，这不仅是为朝中人民所坚决反对，且为世界爱好和平的人民所一致反对。
    人们知道，目前在开城举行的会议是庄严的朝鲜停战谈判会议，双方只应考虑如何使战争停下来，停止流血，有利于朝鲜和平的获得。我方代表正确地认为：双方武装部队撤离三八线，建立非军事区，就是实现朝鲜停战的基础。马立克提出了这个和平建议，并认为为了确保朝鲜的和平，这代价不算太高。中朝人民百分之百地拥护这个建议，我方参加停战谈判的代表也忠实地尊重这个原则。但美方代表想的却是如何建立有利的良好的“防御”阵地。为了这，还要把它的“防御”阵地选择在三八线以北，深入我军地区之内。美国侵略者是惯于把自己的“防御”线建立在别国的领土之上，“防御”这两个字对美国侵略者说来，正是侵略的代名词，这乃是举世皆知的。因此，人们就应当揭破美方代表的这个阴谋，它企图利用停战谈判取得武力所不能得到的阵地，并为再战而作打算。美方代表以保证部队安全作为借口，掩盖其侵略实质。他们并厚颜无耻地把自己的这种侵略阴谋说成是为了防止“侵略”的发生。究竟谁是侵略者呢？是保卫祖国的中国人民和朝鲜人民侵略了美国，还是出兵几千英里外侵略别国领土、破坏其人民的和平生活的美国政府侵略了中国和朝鲜？这个最简单的事实，是企图混淆黑白的美国代表所不能改变的。最近，美国方面声明不同意以三八线作为军事分界线。据说因为这又是“政治”问题。尽人皆知：三八线决非朝鲜领土的分界线，三八线乃是对日作战中苏军和美军为了执行军事任务而划定的军事分界线，因此，目前作为朝鲜停战期间的军事分界线，自然也是无可非议的。美国方面之所以又要抬出这块“政治问题决不能讨论”的挡箭牌，是妄想迫使我方对他们狂妄无理的要求让步。中朝人民一贯主张和平解决朝鲜问题，我方代表曾在记者采访及中立区问题和撤兵问题上作了让步。尝到了甜头的美国侵略者把我方这种和平诚意视为软弱忍让，因而得寸进尺，贪得无厌，竟至提出荒唐无理的领土要求，那就是大错特错了。美方代表的这种妄想只会落空，而他们在谈判中缺乏诚意，拖延时间的政策，必将引起全世界人民的强烈反对，也将引起前线上美李军士兵的更大不满。据不完全统计，自七月十日以来，美李军又有近万人在进攻中作了无谓的牺牲品。美李军的士兵们迫切地希望停止战争回到自己的家园去，而代表华盛顿坐在开城会议席上的美方代表还是念念不忘战争，对和平尚未拿出具体的诚意。
