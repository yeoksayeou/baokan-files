The Propaganda Department of the Liaodong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a province-wide propaganda meeting from July 15th to 22nd. The meeting reviewed the patriotic pact movement in the province and formulated a plan to promote the movement universally and deeply. The results of the review and the future plans are summarized below for reference by other regions.

Currently, people of all social strata in Liaodong Province have established many patriotic pacts. Some regions and units have created relatively good patriotic pacts, which have greatly promoted various tasks. However, on a province-wide scale, the promotion of patriotic pacts is not universal or balanced. It is more common in cities and industrial and mining areas, and weaker in rural areas. Although some areas have promoted patriotic pacts, they have not been effective because the leadership has not paid enough attention and lacks specific guidance. Some areas have completely ignored the work of promoting patriotic pacts. The reasons for this deviation are mainly: (1) The leading organs in some places have simply regarded the promotion of patriotic pacts as a routine administrative task, resulting in a phenomenon where a few cadres and activists take over and do everything, and the masses do not know what a patriotic pact is. (2) The phenomenon of "copying mechanically" without starting from reality is relatively common. For example, the Anshan Municipal Government, a non-production department, proposed "insisting on production" in its patriotic pact. Some units have no religious believers at all, but they also included the "Three-Self Reform Movement" in their patriotic pacts. Some pacts are empty in content, have unclear requirements, and lack a time frame. Some pacts have too many clauses and list all unimportant details. For example, the pact of the Second Complete Primary School in Liaoyang City has a total of five articles and forty-four clauses, even including "must sing the national anthem when raising the flag." (3) The content of the patriotic pacts is not sufficiently integrated with the immediate interests of the masses, and in-depth ideological education is neglected, so that the masses cannot fully realize that the establishment of patriotic pacts is beneficial to the country and to individuals; instead, they only emphasize the various obligations that citizens should fulfill. Therefore, the masses respond: establishing patriotic pacts is a "public matter," and it is impossible not to do it, so they adopt a perfunctory attitude. (4) The scope of establishing patriotic pacts is too large. Most of them are comprehensive patriotic pacts established by large units. Specific patriotic pacts have not been established in grassroots units, let alone group patriotic pacts or individual plans to guarantee the implementation of patriotic pacts. (5) There is a lack of a regular inspection system, and no one cares about the pacts after they are established.

In order to overcome the deviations in the patriotic pact movement and promote its universal and in-depth development, the following key points for future work are proposed: (1) Enhance the political understanding of cadres at all levels regarding the promotion of patriotic pacts, so that they deeply understand that patriotic pacts are an important form of constantly promoting political and production movements and uniting people from all walks of life in common activities, and an important method of mobilizing, educating, and contacting the masses. All important tasks should be included in the patriotic pacts and carried out through the form of patriotic pacts. (2) Do a good job in patriotic education for the people, explain the meaning and methods of establishing patriotic pacts, and enlighten their political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm, so that they deeply realize the benefits of establishing patriotic pacts for themselves, and thus consciously and voluntarily participate in the movement to establish patriotic pacts. When establishing patriotic pacts, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, and conduct prior deliberation and discussion among the masses to correct and prevent the tendency of coercion and commandism and doing everything on behalf of the masses. (3) The establishment of patriotic pacts must proceed from reality, grasp the different characteristics of each region and each class of people, and be specific according to the actual situation of each industry and profession. At the same time, it is necessary to link it with the immediate interests of the masses. The clauses of the pact should be simple and clear, and the main tasks to be done and the main problems to be solved in a certain period should be included, so that each clause can be implemented. (4) The scope of the pact should be small, and group and family patriotic pacts should be established, or individual plans to guarantee the implementation of patriotic pacts should be established to ensure the realization of the patriotic pacts. (5) Patriotic pacts should be time-sensitive and should be continuously supplemented and revised according to different situations. Generally, they can be established by season. (6) After the patriotic pacts are established, the grassroots Resist America, Aid Korea Association should be responsible for timely inspection and regular summary, and the inspection should be combined with revision, so that the patriotic pacts can continuously obtain new content with the development of the work. (7) Strengthen leadership in promoting patriotic pacts. The variety of patriotic pacts will inevitably disperse the energy of the masses and should be merged. All people's organizations and administrative departments should act in coordination, and generally check the establishment and implementation of patriotic pacts in all parts of the province in August, commend models, promote successful experiences, overcome shortcomings, promote the backward, and universally promote the patriotic pact movement.

### 辽东省推行爱国公约的情况和问题

　　辽东省推行爱国公约的情况和问题
    中共辽东省委宣传部在七月十五日到二十二日召开了一次全省的宣传会议，检查了该省的爱国公约运动，制订了普遍深入开展这一运动的计划。现将检查的结果和今后的计划摘要发表如下，以供各地参考。
    目前，辽东省各阶层人民已经订立了不少的爱国公约。其中有的地区和单位的爱国公约订得比较好，对各项工作起了很大的推动作用。但就全省范围来说，爱国公约的推行还是不普遍、不平衡的。城市和工矿区较普遍，农村较差。有的地区虽然推行了爱国公约，但由于领导上不够重视，缺乏具体的领导，很多爱国公约不起作用。有的地区根本忽视推行爱国公约的工作。产生这种偏向的原因，主要是：（一）某些地方的领导机关把推行爱国公约单纯地当成一件事务工作，因而发生了少数干部和积极分子包办代替的现象，群众不知道什么是爱国公约。（二）不从实际出发，“照着葫芦画瓢”的现象较为普遍。如非生产部门的安东市政府机关，爱国公约中提出“坚持生产”，有的单位根本没有宗教信徒，却把“三自革新运动”也订在爱国公约之内。有的公约内容空洞，要求不明确，没有时间性。有的公约条款多，把一切无关紧要的枝节问题都列上。如辽阳市第二完全小学的公约，共五款四十四条，连“升旗时一定要唱国歌”等都订在公约内。（三）爱国公约的内容与群众的切身利益结合不够，忽视向人民群众进行深入的思想教育，致使群众不能充分认识到订立爱国公约对国家对个人都有好处；而只单纯强调国民的各项应尽的义务。所以群众反应：订爱国公约是“公事”，不订不行，因而采取应付态度。（四）订立爱国公约的范围太大，大多数是以大单位订立综合性的爱国公约，没有在基层单位中订立具体的爱国公约，更没有订立小组爱国公约或个人保证执行爱国公约的计划。（五）缺乏经常的检查制度，公约订立以后即无人过问。
    为着克服爱国公约运动中的偏向，使这一运动普遍深入发展，提出今后的工作要点是：（一）提高各级干部对推行爱国公约的政治认识，使他们深刻了解爱国公约是经常推动政治运动、生产运动不断前进与团结各阶层人民共同活动的一种重要形式，是发动、教育与联系群众的重要方法。一切重要工作均列入爱国公约，通过爱国公约形式来进行。（二）做好对人民群众的爱国教育，说明订爱国公约的意义和方法，启发他们的政治觉悟和爱国热情，使之深刻认识订爱国公约对自己的好处，从而自觉自愿地参加订立爱国公约的运动。订立爱国公约时，必须充分发动群众，事先经过群众酝酿讨论，纠正和防止强迫命令和包办代替的倾向。（三）订立爱国公约必须从实际出发，掌握各地区和各阶层人民的不同特点，根据各界各业的实际情况而具体化，同时要联系群众的切身利益。公约条文要简单、明确，把在一定时期内要做的主要工作和要解决的主要问题订上去，做到条条都能贯彻执行。（四）订约的范围要小，应订立小组和家庭的爱国公约或订立个人保证执行爱国公约的计划，以保证爱国公约的实现。（五）爱国公约应该是有时间性的，应根据不同的情况不断地加以补充和修正。一般可按季节来订立。（六）爱国公约订立后，应由基层抗美援朝会负责及时检查与定期总结，把检查与修订结合起来，使爱国公约随着工作的发展而不断地获得新的内容。（七）推行爱国公约要加强领导。爱国公约种类繁多必将分散群众的精力，应加以合并。各人民团体和行政主管部门应协同动作，在八月份内普遍检查一次全省各地爱国公约订立和执行的情况，表扬模范，推广成功经验，克服缺点，推动落后，把爱国公约运动普遍地推行起来。
