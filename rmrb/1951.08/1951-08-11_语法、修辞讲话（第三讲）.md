Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 3)
    Lü Shuxiang Zhu Dexi
    Section 4: Quantity, Comparison

    "两" (liǎng, two) and "二" (èr, two). "两" and "二" refer to the same number. Generally, "两" is used, but "二" is sometimes used before units of measurement. Now, it is often seen that "二" is used where "两" should be used, such as:

    (1) The two sanatoriums of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions officially opened in Hangzhou yesterday. (Newspaper, large headline)

    (2) Our home visits started at two o'clock in the afternoon. (Work)

    These two authors cannot be unaware that "两" should be used here, but they deliberately violate the rule simply because the character "两" has many strokes, while "二" has only two. Seeking temporary convenience and destroying language habits is not advisable.

    "每" (měi, every) and "各" (gè, each) are not equivalent to "所有" (suǒyǒu, all). "每" and "各" actually include all individuals, but they have different starting points from "所有" or "一切" (yīqiè, everything) and are not equal. The following two sentences should use "所有":

    (3) Every expert and staff member participating in the work cooperated tirelessly and achieved good results. (Journal)

    (4) The Resist America, Aid Korea movement of the East China people swept through every city and village. (Journal)

    At the same time, (3) has an extra "着" (zhe, indicates continuing action), and "席卷" (xíjuǎn, sweep) in (4) is also inappropriate. One can only say "普及" (pǔjí, popularized) or "掀动" (xiāndòng, stirred up).

    The usage of the word "比" (bǐ, compare). When comparing two things, the word "比" cannot always be used. It is only used when distinguishing between high and low, such as "This village is bigger than that one." When things are equal, similar, or different, "比" is not used. These three sentences are wrong:

    (5) The number of books lost each month is almost equal to, and sometimes even exceeds, the number of books purchased each month. (Work)

    (6) Furthermore, in fact, very few textbooks and teachers can make the latter cycle significantly different from the previous cycle. (Journal)

    (7) Production conditions have changed and improved compared to the past due to the overall improvement of the economic situation. (Draft)

    (5) and (6) should use "和" (hé, and) or "跟" (gēn, with). (7) can simply say "生产条件跟着整个经济情势的好转而好转 (Production conditions improve along with the overall improvement of the economic situation)", which already implies "跟过去不同 (different from the past)". In the following two sentences, the word "比" can only be used if other parts are modified to match:

    (8) These news items are more exciting than the last, and make people feel more and more... (Newspaper)

    (9) The scale of this project exceeds the total of the spring repair budgets of the Kuomintang in 1929, 30, 31, 34, and 35 by more than double. (Education)

    The "地" (de, adverbial particle) in (8) is unnecessary, and a "更" (gèng, even more) should be added below so that "比" has a landing point. In (9), since "比" is used above, one can only say "大 (big)" below, not "超过 (exceed)"; or the word "超过" can be moved to the position of "比", which also works. (The word "了" (le, completion particle) is redundant; "规模 (scale)" cannot be compared with "总数 (total number)", and should be changed to "费用 (cost)").

    Increase and decrease. When talking about increase and decrease, exceeding and falling short, problems often arise. For example:

    (10) There is a female production team leader named Gu Monova, whose monthly work exceeds the planned target by 45% to 130%. (Journal)

    (11) In the first four months of this year, the soybean cakes supplied by the cooperative exceeded 2.5 times the total supply of last year. (Newspaper)

    (12) The original output was only 200 tons per day. After accepting this new experience, the daily output can reach more than 350 tons, an increase of 175%. (Draft)

    (10) says that the production team leader's work only exceeded the planned target by 45%, which means that what was completed was less than half of the plan? What is there to praise? Obviously, there is an extra "的" (de, possessive particle) here. The exceeding portion is 45%. The presence or absence of this "的" makes a big difference! (11) is what makes it impossible to determine the correct meaning. If there is a "的", then it is 2.5 to 1; but it is very likely that this "的" is used incorrectly, so it would be 3.5 to 1. The problem with (12) is the opposite. There is a missing "到" (dào, to) under "提高 (increase)", because 350 to 200 is exactly 175 to 100. If it increased by 175%, it would be 275 to 100, and there should be 550 tons. But rather than saying "提高到百分之一百七十五 (increase to 175%)", it is easier to understand to say "提高了百分之七十五 (increased by 75%)". Furthermore, "提高百分之七十五 (increased by 75%)" is more colloquial than "提高四分之三 (increased by three-quarters)". Except in specialized treatises, if possible, it is best not to use hundreds of percent but to use multiples.

    Secondly, when talking about decrease, one can only say decrease by a fraction, not decrease by multiples. Only when talking about large numbers can multiples be used. The following three sentences all make this mistake:

    (13) The workers in the casting shop reduced the furnace opening time by one-fold, from once every ten days to once every five days. (Journal)

    (14) The total number of injury leaves in the whole month decreased by 300% compared to June last year (the month before the cold repair), and sick leaves decreased by 500%. (Journal)

    (15) The peace camp headed by China and the Soviet Union has a population of over 800 million... Compared with the total population of only 300 million in the twelve countries of the US-British imperialist aggressor group, imperialism is short by 1.5 times. (Journal)

    (13) should be "缩短一半 (shortened by half)". (14)'s "减少百分之三百……之五百 (decrease by 300%...500%)" is especially difficult to understand. In fact, it is "减少四分之三 (decrease by three-quarters)" and "减少六分之五 (decrease by five-sixths)". Following on from the above, "...比较，多了一倍半 (…compared to, more by 1.5 times)" in (15) was originally very good, but for some reason it was reversed to say "帝国主义差了一倍半 (imperialism is short by 1.5 times)", which makes it both awkward and difficult to understand. (At least the words "阵营 (camp)" must be added after "帝国主义 (imperialism)").

            Section 5: 着 (zhe), 了 (le)

    "着" (zhe) indicates the continuation of an action. Adding "着" after a verb indicates that the action is in progress. Therefore, actions that cannot be sustained cannot use "着". For example, when a person enters a room, they enter it all at once and cannot say "进着屋子 (enter-ing the room)". The "着" in these two sentences is redundant:

    (1) Some cadres are taking an indifferent attitude towards the implementation of the Marriage Law. (Newspaper)

    (2) The organization and work of the Yanbei Survey Team fully demonstrates this new direction and new style. (Journal)

    If it hasn't been adopted, it hasn't been adopted. Once it has been adopted, it is "采取了 (adopted)", and it cannot be constantly "采取着 (adopt-ing)". (The author probably means "抱着 (holding)"). "表现 (demonstrate)" is also like this. It demonstrates all at once, and there is no need to "表现着 (demonstrate-ing)". You can add "了 (le)", but it is not necessary.

    Secondly, if the verb itself contains the meaning of continuation, there is no need to use "着". For example, "爱 (ài, love)", "恨 (hèn, hate)", "害怕 (hàipà, fear)", "拥护 (yōnghù, support)" are not things that pass quickly, so we do not say "爱着 (love-ing)", "拥护着 (support-ing)", etc. "需要 (xūyào, need)", "企图 (qǐtú, attempt)" are also like this, so the "着" in the following two sentences is redundant:

    (3) There are also many great plans and schemes that need our labor and knowledge. (Newspaper)

    (4) This shows that the landlord class is still unwilling to give up and is still attempting to stand on the people's heads again. (Newspaper)

    (3) is not complete in meaning and should add "来完成 (to complete)". The two most typical verbs of this type are "是 (shì, is)" and "有 (yǒu, have)". No one uses "是着 (is-ing)" yet, but "有着 (have-ing)" is flying all over the place. Examples are readily available. Let's take a few: "有着各种各样的店铺 (having all kinds of shops)" (Journal), "有着积极克服困难的精神 (having the spirit of actively overcoming difficulties)" (Journal), "大都有着自己的兴家计划 (mostly having their own plans to build their families)" (Journal). Please think about what use these "着" are. In short, only actions that can be continued or not can use the word "着" to indicate continuation. And not every continuing action must be added with "着". If you do not want to emphasize this continuity, you do not need to add "着", for example: "他在里头写信，你在这里等一等 (He is writing a letter inside, you wait here for a while)".

    "了" (le) indicates the end of an action. Most actions can end, so there are very few verbs that cannot add "了". Only those verbs mentioned at the end of the previous section, whose actions cannot end in the short term, so we do not say "爱了他 (loved him)" (but can say "爱上了他 (fell in love with him)", or "爱了他三年 (loved him for three years)") or "需要了劳力 (needed labor)". On the other hand, if the verb itself contains the meaning of ending, there is no need to add "了", as in the following two sentences:

    (5) It tasked the party committees and party groups at all levels to help with this work. (Journal)

    (6) All mine staff must participate, including administrative, party, and labor movement cadres. (Journal)

    "责成 (tasked)" has already tasked, and "包括 (included)" has already included.

    The meaning of ending cannot use "着". Since the word "着" indicates the continuation of an action, then if the action has ended, you naturally can't add "着" anymore. Some verb structures have the meaning of ending, such as certain two-character verbs, where the second character indicates the result of the first character, like the examples below:

    (7) It fully illustrates that there are no insurmountable difficulties in the face of the working class. (Draft)

    (8) We must engage in construction in all aspects, to create the necessary conditions for agricultural collectivization, and to pave the way for the brilliant tomorrow of hundreds of millions of farmers.

    Because "说 (shuō, say)" leads to "明 (míng, illustrate)", and "铺 (pū, pave)" leads to "平 (píng, smooth)", they all have the meaning of ending, so you can't add "着". (7) can add "了", or not. (8) cannot add "着" or "了", because although the verb "铺平 (pave smooth)" is ending, the action here has not yet been realized.

    In sentences using "把 (bǎ, direct object marker)" and "被 (bèi, passive marker)", the verbs below generally indicate completed actions, so they often add "了", and generally (but not absolutely) cannot add "着". The second "着" in the following sentence is not allowed:

    (9) Because he came with many democratic figures, he was also being treated and stayed at the Beijing Hotel. (Journal)

    The context can also determine whether an action is over. The following two sentences have ended:

    (10) He answered the questions of the villagers with action. (Newspaper)

    (11) Republican Senator George Aiken of Vermont estimates that there are more than 10 million Americans who cannot afford enough food to support their families. (Translation)

    (10) should be "回答了 (answered)". (11) is "估计 (estimate)" or "估计过 (estimated)".

    "能 (néng, can)", "可 (kě, can)", etc. are not followed by "着" and "了". Verbs after verbs like "能 (néng, can)", "会 (huì, will)", "可以 (kěyǐ, can)", "应该 (yīnggāi, should)" represent an action that has not yet been realized, with no continuation or ending, so there can be no "着" or "了". The "着" and "了" in the following sentences should be removed:

    (12) Reasoning and complaining are the most powerful methods of struggle, which can not only severely strike the landlords, but also enlighten the class consciousness of the masses. (Draft)

    (13) Of course, if Mr. Tao was wrong in this matter, it is not enough to cover up all the glory of Mr. Tao. (Newspaper)

    (14) This is also enough to destroy the integrity and systematic research of underground ancient cultural relics and hinder the scientific and purposeful excavation work in progress. (Journal)

    (15) Secondly, avoid repeated translations of a certain book to avoid wasting manpower. (Journal)

    The "着" in the following two sentences is also unnecessary:

    (16) Every corner of the school is filled with joy and cheers, preparing to welcome and entertain our friends. (Work)

    (17) Chinese workers have begun to live a good life. (Journal, title)

    (16) Since it is still being prepared, it has not yet been realized. (17) The action has just begun, and cannot be in progress at the same time.

    "着" and "了" and some adverbs. Some adverbs related to time can determine whether "着" and "了" are used or not. The "着" and "了" in the following sentences are used incorrectly (the first "着" in examples 23, and the first "了" in examples 20 and 24 are correct).

    (18) Will gradually step into our country's mountains and rivers, ravaging our people. (Letter)

    (19) A significant point is that the profits of hoarding goods can never抵得过(dǐ dé guò, offset) the loss of interest expenses, and eventually, they will still suffer losses in the price of goods. (Journal)

    (20) At present, the people of the whole country have been忍无可忍(rěn wú kě rěn, reached the limit of tolerance) for the crazy acts of aggression by US imperialism and are掀起了(xiān qǐ le, starting) a movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect the family, and defend the country. (Journal)

    (21) In the past hundred years, wars have been constantly occurring in China. (Work)

    (22) Pleasant songs are broadcast from the train from time to time. (Newspaper)

    (23) The entire East is undergoing dramatic turmoil, with struggles more intense than ever in a century. (Journal)

    (24) In the past, the Nanjing Museum, like other museums, was a decoration for the reactionary ruling class and did not play a role in educating and enlightening the masses. (Journal)

    "将要 (jiāngyào, will)" and "还要 (háiyào, still want)" refer to future things, and cannot be "着 (zhe)" or "了 (le)". "正在 (zhèngzài, is in the process of)" can be followed by "着 (zhe)", but not "了 (le)". (But example 20 has the word "起 (qǐ, start)", which cannot be followed by "着 (zhe)".) "不断 (bùduàn, constantly)" and "不时 (bùshí, from time to time)" seem to go well with the word "着 (zhe)" (that's what the authors of these two sentences thought), but they don't. "不断 (bùduàn, constantly)" and "不时 (bùshí, from time to time)" both mean one time after another, which is intermittent, not continuous. In the last two examples, since the things haven't happened, how can we talk about continuation and ending. After "没有 (méiyǒu, have not)", usually use "过 (guò, experience)".

    "着" and "了" appear at the same time. In the following four sentences, "着" and "了" appear at the same time:

    (25) US imperialism is gradually pushing the war of aggression against Korea towards our country's borders, seriously threatening our peaceful and happy life. (Journal)

    (26) Looking at you, you must have something on your mind. (Work)

    (27) They were all warmly welcomed by the Soviet people and visited the socialist construction of the Soviet Union. (Newspaper)

    (28) Eliminating and is eliminating the influence of imperialism in China. (Newspaper)

    (25) "着了 (zhele)" combined does not make sense, so "了 (le)" should be removed and "着 (zhe)" should be kept. (26)'s "了 (le)" is a modal particle, but the modal particle after the word "着 (zhe)" is generally "呢 (ne)" not "了 (le)". The "有着 (yǒuzhe, have-ing)" in this sentence is completely wrong, so you can only say "一定有什么心事 (must have something on your mind)". (27) has two clauses in parallel, one uses "着 (zhe)" and one uses "了 (le)", which is not coordinated. "受着 (shòuzhe, receiving)" should be changed to "受到了 (shòudào le, received)". (28) imitates the emerging sentence structure without considering the logic, making it self-contradictory: since it has already "肃清了 (sùqīng le, eliminated)", where is there anything left to "肃清着 (sùqīngzhe, eliminate-ing)"?

    To summarize in one sentence, "着 (zhe)" and "了 (le)", do not use them unless necessary. Now these two words are used too liberally, especially the word "着 (zhe)". Chairman Mao used only four "着 (zhe)" in his 8,000-word "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship", but in someone's article, a paragraph of less than 1,500 words used sixteen "着 (zhe)", of which only four were necessary. The word "了 (le)" is less jarring because it originally had some flexibility and could often be used or not, but it should also be streamlined.

　　语法、修辞讲话（第三讲）
    吕叔湘　朱德熙
    第四段  数量、比较
    “两”和“二”。“两”和“二”指同一个数目，平常都用“两”，只有度量衡单位之前有时候用“二”。现在常常看见该用“两”的地方用“二”，如：
    （一）上海总工会的二个休养所昨天在杭州正式开幕了。（报，大字标题）
    （二）我们的家庭访问是从下午二点钟开始的。（作）这两位作者不会不知道这里该用“两”，然而明知故犯，只因为“两”字笔画多，“二”字只两笔。贪图一时的小方便，破坏语言的习惯，这是不足取的。
    “每”和“各”不等于“所有”。“每”和“各”实际包括一切个体，但是和“所有”或“一切”的出发点不同，不能相等。下面这两句都应该用“所有”：
    （三）每位参加工作的专家和工作人员都不辞劳瘁的通力合作着，有了很好的成绩。（期）
    （四）华东人民的抗美援朝运动席卷了每一城市和乡村。（期）同时，（三）多了一个“着”，（四）的“席卷”也不合适，只能说“普及”或“掀动”。
    “比”字的用法。比较两样东西，不一定都能用“比”字，只有分高下的时候才用“比”，如“这个村子比那个大”。相等的时候，相同或不同的时候，都不用“比”。这三句是错的：
    （五）每月所丢书的数目比每月所购入书的数目几乎相等，有时还要超过。（作）
    （六）并且事实上所有课本和教师都很少能够使后一个循环比前一个循环有什么显著的区别。（期）
    （七）生产条件，由于整个经济情势开始好转，比过去起了变化，有了好转。（稿）（五）和（六）用“和”或“跟”。（七）只要说“生产条件跟着整个经济情势的好转而好转”，“跟过去不同”的意思已经在内了。底下这两句用“比”字就得在别的地方修改一下，才能配合：
    （八）这些消息一次比一次地令人兴奋，一次比一次地令人感到……（报）
    （九）这一个工程的规模，比国民党在一九二九、三○、三一、三四、三五年这五年的春修预算的总数超过了一倍以上。（教）
    （八）的“地”字不需要，倒是应该在底下加个“更”字，“比”字才有着落。（九）上面既用“比”，下面只能说“大”，不能用“超过”；或是把“超过”挪在“比”字的地位上，也成。（“了”字多余；“规模”也不能跟“总数”比较，应该改做“费用”。）
    增加和减少。说到增加和减少、超过和不及，也常常会出毛病。例如：
    （十）有个叫古莫诺瓦的女生产队长，她每个月的工作都要超过预定计划的百分之四十五到百分之一百三十。（期）
    （十一）今年头四个月合作社供给的豆饼超过去年全年供应量的两倍半。（报）
    （十二）原来的产量只有每天二百吨，接受了这个新经验之后，每天能生产三百五十多吨，提高了百分之一百七十五。（稿）（十）说这个生产队长的工作只超过预定计划的百分之四十五，那不是所完成的还不到计划的一半吗？有什么值得表扬的呢？这里显然多了个“的”字，是超过的部分有百分之四十五。这个“的”字的出入可大啦！（十一）就是因此使人不能决定正确的意思。如果有“的”字，那是二点五比一；可是很可能这个“的”字是用错的，那末就是三点五比一。（十二）的毛病刚相反。“提高”底下少个“到”字，因为三百五十比二百正是一百七十五比一百。如果提高了百分之一百七十五，就是二百七十五比一百，应该有五百五十吨了。可是与其说“提高到百分之一百七十五”，又不如说“提高了百分之七十五”容易懂些。更进一步，“提高百分之七十五”又不如“提高四分之三”更通俗。除了在专门论著里头，如果可能，最好不用百分之几百几十而用几点几倍。
    其次，说到减少，只能说减少几分之几，不能说减少几倍。只有往大里说才能用倍数。下面三句都犯这个毛病：
    （十三）铸型场的工人们把开炉时间缩短一倍，由从前十天开一炉改为五天开一炉。（期）
    （十四）全月伤假较去年六月（冷修前的一月）减少百分之三百，病假减少百分之五百。（期）
    （十五）以中苏为首的和平阵营共有八亿多人口……这与美英帝国主义侵略集团的十二个国家总共不过三亿人口比较，帝国主义差了一倍半。（期）（十三）应该是“缩短一半”。（十四）的“减少百分之三百……之五百”尤其叫人难懂，其实是“减少四分之三”和“减少六分之五”。（十五）顺着上面说下来，“……比较，多了一倍半”本来很好，不知为什么又颠倒过来说“帝国主义差了一倍半”，弄得既不顺，又难懂。（“帝国主义”底下至少也得加“阵营”二字。）
            第五段  着、了
    “着”表示行为的持续。在动词后头加“着”字，表示这个行为在持续之中。因此不能持续的行为就不能用“着”，例如一个人进屋子，一下子就进来了，就不能说“进着屋子”。像这两句里的“着”就是多余的：
    （一）对婚姻法的贯彻执行，部分干部采取着漠不关心的态度。（报）
    （二）雁北勘查团的组织与工作，便充分的表现着这种新的方向与新的作风。（期）没有采取的时候是没有采取，已经采取就是“采取了”，不能老在那里“采取着”。（作者的意思也许是“抱着”。）“表现”也是这样，一下子就表现出来了，用不着“表现着”；可以加“了”字，但也不是非加不可。
    其次，动词本身含有持续的意思，也就不必用“着”。例如“爱”“恨”“害怕”“拥护”这些，都不是一下子就过去的，我们就不说“爱着”“拥护着”等等。“需要”“企图”这些也都是这样，所以下面这两句里的“着”字是多余的：
    （三）还有许多伟大的计划和方案需要着我们的劳力和知识。（报）
    （四）这说明了地主阶级直到现在还不死心，还企图着再站在人民头上。（报）
    （三）的意思没完全，应加“来完成”。这类动词里头最典型的两个是“是”和“有”。现在还没有人用“是着”，可是“有着”已经满天飞了。例子俯拾即是，姑且举几个：“有着各种各样的店铺”（期），“有着积极克服困难的精神”（期），“大都有着自己的兴家计划”（期）。请大家想一想，这些“着”字要它有什么用？总之，只有可持续可不持续的行为，才需要用“着”字表示持续。而且不是每逢持续的行为就一定非加“着”不可。如果你不要强调这个持续性，就不必加“着”，例如：“他在里头写信，你在这里等一等。”
    “了”表示行为的结束。大多数行为都是能结束的，所以很少动词不能加“了”。只有上一节最后所说那些动词，它们所表示的行为是短期内不能结束的，所以我们不说“爱了他”（但可以“爱上了他”，或“爱了他三年”）或“需要了劳力”。在另一方面，如果动词本身含有结束的意思，也就不必加“了”，像底下这两句就是：
    （五）责成了各级党委和党组帮助这个工作。（期）
    （六）凡是矿上工作人员都须参加，包括了行政、党、工运的干部。（期）“责成”就已经责成了，“包括”就已经包括了。
    有结束的意思不能用“着”。“着”字既然是表示行为的持续，那末如果行为已经结束，自然不能再加“着”。有些格式里的动词是有结束的意思的，例如某些个两个字的动词，第二个字表示第一个字的结果，像底下的例子：
    （七）充分说明着在工人阶级面前没有不可战胜的困难。（稿）
    （八）我们要从事各方面的建设，来创造农业集体化的必要的条件，来为几万万农民的灿烂的明天铺平着道路。因“说”而“明”，因“铺”而“平”，都有结束的意思，就不能加“着”。（七）可以加“了”，也可以不加。（八）不能加“着”也不能加“了”，因为“铺平”这个动词虽然是结束性的，这里这个行为可还没有实现。
    用“把”和用“被”的句子，下面的动词大率表示结束了的行为，所以常常加“了”，而一般地（但不是绝对地）不能加“着”。下面这一句的第二个“着”是不能有的：  （九）因为是随着许多民主人士一块儿来的，所以也被招待着住在北京饭店。（期）
    上下文也能决定某一行为是否结束，下面这两句就是结束了的：
    （十）他用行动回答着老乡们的问题。（报）
    （十一）威尔满州共和党参议员乔治安根估计着，买不起足够食物来维持他们家属的美国人，总在一千万以上。（译）（十）应该是“回答了”。（十一）是“估计”或“估计过”。
    “能”“可”等等之后不用“着”和“了”。“能”“会”“可以”“应该”这些动词后头的动词代表一种还没有实现的行为，无所谓持续，也无所谓结束，所以不能有“着”或“了”。底下这些句子里的“着”和“了”都应该去掉：
    （十二）说理诉苦是最有力的斗争方法，既可以沉痛的打击了地主，更可以启发群众的阶级觉悟。（稿）
    （十三）自然，如果陶先生在这件事上错了，那并不足以掩盖了陶先生的全部的光辉。（报）
    （十四）这也足以破坏地下的古代文物的完整和有系统的研究，阻碍着科学的、有目的的发掘工作的进行。（期）
    （十五）其次要避免某一本书的重复翻译，以免浪费了人力。（期）下面这两句的“着”也用不上：
    （十六）学校里每个角落里都是喜悦和欢呼，准备迎接着招待着我们的朋友。（作）
    （十七）中国工人开始过着美好的日子。（期，标题）
    （十六）既然还在准备，当然还没有实现。（十七）行为刚才开始，就不能同时已在持续。
    “着”和“了”和某些副词。有些跟时间有关的副词能决定“着”和“了”的用或不用。底下这些句子里的“着”和“了”都用错了（二三例的第一个“着”、二十例和二四例的第一个“了”不错）。
    （十八）将要一步一步的踏进我国的山河，糟蹋着我国的人民。（信）
    （十九）显著的一点便是囤货的利益决抵不过利息支出的损失，最后在货价上还要吃了亏。（期）
    （二十）目前，全国人民对美帝国主义疯狂的侵略暴行已忍无可忍了，正在掀起了抗美援朝保家卫国运动。（期）
    （二一）近百年来，中国不断发生着战争。（作）
    （二二）火车上不时地播送着悦耳的歌曲。（报）
    （二三）整个的东方剧烈的动荡着，一世纪以来从没有这样强烈地斗争着。（期）
    （二四）过去南京博物院和其他的博物院一样，是给反动统治阶级作了点缀品，并没有起了教育群众，启发群众的作用。（期）“将要”和“还要”指未来的事情，既不能“着”也不能“了”。“正在”之后可以用“着”，不能用“了”。（但二十例有“起”字，即不能再加“着”。）“不断”和“不时”似乎跟“着”字配合得很好（这两句的作者就这样想），其实不然。“不断”和“不时”都表示一次又一次，是断断续续的，不是持续的。最后两例，既然事情没有发生，怎么说得上持续和结束。“没有”之后，照例用“过”。
    “着”和“了”同时出现。下面这四句里，“着”和“了”同时出现：
    （二五）美帝将侵朝战争逐步推向我国边境，严重地威胁着了我们和平幸福生活。（期）
    （二六）你这个样子，一定有着什么心事了。（作）
    （二七）他们都受着苏联人民热烈的款待，参观了苏联的社会主义建设。（报）
    （二八）在中国境内肃清了并正在肃清着帝国主义的影响。（报）（二五）“着了”合用，讲不通，应该去“了”留“着”。（二六）的“了”是语气词，但是“着”字后面的语气词通例用“呢”不用“了”。这句的“有着”根本不对，所以只能说“一定有什么心事”。（二七）并列两个分句，一用“着”，一用“了”，不协调，应该把“受着”改做“受到了”。（二八）模仿新兴句法而没有顾到逻辑，弄得自相矛盾：既然已经“肃清了”，哪里还有东西可供“肃清着”呢？
    总结一句话，“着”和“了”，非必要的时候不要用。现在这两个字都用的太滥，尤其是“着”字。毛主席在八千多字的“论人民民主专政”里只用了四个“着”字，可是有人的一篇文章里，不到一千五百字的一段就用了十六个“着”字，其中只有四个是需要的。“了”字因为本来有点弹性，往往可以不用也可以用，所以还不太刺耳，不过也应该精简些。
