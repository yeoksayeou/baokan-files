    Churchill's "Grievances"
    The warmonger Churchill attacked the Labour government's Middle East policy in the British Parliament. He said that the difficulties Britain is currently experiencing in Iran and Egypt are due to the decline in British prestige caused by Britain's withdrawal from India.
    The warmonger Churchill's "grievances" will "develop" further, because the vast people of Iran, Egypt, and India not only have never looked up to Britain's "prestige" in the slightest, but are also determined to kick out the British aggression forces.
            The Conspiracy of the American and Italian Reactionaries
    Instigated by the United States, the reactionary Italian government has recently formally proposed to the United States, Britain, and France to revise the peace treaty with Italy. This is an important conspiracy by American imperialism to further expand Italy's war preparations. The aim is to abolish the clause in the treaty stipulating that the Italian army shall not exceed 250,000 men, so as to let the Italian rulers provide more cannon fodder for the American war of aggression. As for the Italian reactionaries, they vainly attempt to use the revision of the treaty to incite the chauvinistic sentiments of the Italian people and maintain their precarious rule. But the wishful thinking of the American and Italian reactionaries will not succeed, because the Italian people neither want to be cannon fodder, nor will they be deceived by the likes of De Gasperi.

    邱吉尔的“怨愤”
    战争贩子邱吉尔在英国议会中攻击工党政府的中东政策。他说：英国目前在伊朗与埃及所遭受的困难，是由于英国自印度撤退一事所引起的英国威望的低落。
    战争贩子邱吉尔的“怨愤”还会有“发展”的，因为伊朗、埃及和印度的广大人民不仅一向丝毫看不起英国的“威望”，而且决心要把英国侵略势力一脚踢出去。
            美意反动派的阴谋
    意大利反动政府在美国授意下，最近已正式向美、英、法三国提出修改对意和约的要求，这是美帝国主义企图进一步扩大意大利备战规模的一个重要阴谋，目的是要废除和约中规定意大利军队不得超过二十五万人的条款，以便放手叫意大利统治者为美国侵略战争提供更多的炮灰。而对意大利反动派来说，则妄图利用修改和约煽动意大利人民的沙文主义情绪，维系自己摇摇欲坠的统治。但是美意反动派的如意算盘是打不成的，因为意大利人民既不愿当炮灰，也决不会被加斯贝利之流所骗。
