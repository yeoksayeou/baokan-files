    Heroes Fighting Ice Floes
    —The Story of an Engineering Platoon of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Protecting a Bridge
    By Hou Yimin and Hong Bo

    (I) In March and April of this year, at a certain crossing in Korea, the ice on the river began to melt, and huge ice floes crashed down the river like an avalanche. The bridge spanning the river was on the verge of collapse. The engineering unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, responsible for protecting the bridge, had to blast the ice near the bridge piers into small pieces. This was an extremely difficult and dangerous task.

    (II) At this critical moment, Wang Shirong, the Communist Party member and platoon leader of the engineering platoon, unhesitatingly proposed, "We must blow up the ice floes and repair the bridge to ensure that the supplies to the front lines are not disrupted in any way." Inspired by Wang Shirong's heroism, the other eight soldiers also wrote letters of determination.

    (III) After the entire platoon was ready, Wang Shirong left a letter for the Party branch, guaranteeing that they would resolutely complete the task, and handed over his only 12,000 RMB to the branch as his last Party membership dues in case he was sacrificed.

    和冰排搏斗的英雄
    ——志愿军某部工兵班保护桥梁的故事
    侯逸民 洪波作
    （一）今年三、四月间，朝鲜的某渡口，冰河开始溶化，大冰块山崩地裂般地顺着河流冲了下来。横跨江上的大桥，眼看抵挡不住了。担任保卫桥梁的志愿军某部必须把桥墩附近的水排炸成碎块。这是一个万分艰巨和危险的任务。
    （二）在万分危急的关头，工兵班班长共产党员王世荣毫不犹豫地提出：“我们一定要炸碎冰块抢修桥梁，不让前线的给养发生任何困难。”在王世荣的英雄气概鼓舞下，另外八位战士也都写了决心书。
    （三）全班准备妥当后，王世荣给党的支部留下一封信，保证坚决完成任务，并且把自己仅有的一万二千元人民币交给支部，如果牺牲了，就作为最后一次党费。
