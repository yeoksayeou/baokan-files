The Central-South Industrial Department Begins Inspection of Capital Construction
Major Waste in Capital Construction in 1950

In 1950, the capital construction projects of some state-owned factories and mines in the Central-South region suffered serious waste due to blind construction. Although corrections were made this year, the phenomena of inadequate design or failure to follow plans still exist. The Central-South Industrial Department and its subordinate professional bureaus have organized inspections according to the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council.

The capital construction projects of state-owned factories and mines in the Central-South region include newly built, planned construction, and restoration and expansion of equipment capacity. In most of these projects, there was no design before and after construction, or the design was inadequate, or the design was not well checked. As a result, some projects were forced to stop halfway, some were improperly constructed, and some were revised and rebuilt several times, resulting in huge waste of state property. Among them, the mining projects of non-ferrous metals and coal underground mines were particularly blindly implemented. The construction project of the Qiannan Dajishan Concentrator of the Jiangxi Branch of the Central-South Non-Ferrous Metals Administration Bureau was not only slow in progress, but the supply of ore was only one-fifth of the efficiency of the concentrator. The newly built workshops in Dajishan lacked inspection, and one was blown down by a strong wind. During the project, wood was transported by truck not according to needs but according to the size of the truck, so 30% of it could not be used after it was transported to the construction site. In terms of coal mines, the Xiejiatang New Well project of the Xiangjiang Coal Mine was forced to stop due to high water and soft stone, resulting in excessive mining costs. After the construction of the Xinda Well project of the Pingxiang Coal Mine, the Xinda Well Yanzicao West Main Tunnel was flooded by old mine water, killing 19 workers, and all the machinery and equipment were submerged, stopping work for two and a half months, with a loss of 1.4 billion RMB. Hunan Zhongxiang, Yongshao, Huxiang and other mines were also forced to close down one after another after they started construction, with losses reaching 300 million RMB.

Phenomena such as changing project plans, rework and reconstruction, and not proceeding according to plans, resulting in stockpiling of funds, occur from time to time. The construction of the Nanchang Power Plant should have started last year; due to repeated changes in direction, it only started this year; but due to inadequate design, the construction time must be extended, and it cannot generate electricity as scheduled by the end of this year. The construction project of a certain open hearth furnace of a certain Iron and Steel Company in Central-South did not have a general layout, and the rework waste was also very serious. A certain textile factory accumulated five-sixths of its capital construction funds last year; Zhengzhou Power Plant also stockpiled a large amount of funds due to the purchase of too many materials in capital construction; non-ferrous metal mines also stockpiled one-third of its capital construction funds last year. A newly built zinc smelting plant of a certain lead-zinc mine had to be rebuilt due to improper design, so the completion date had to be postponed from the end of this year to March or June next year.

What are the reasons for the blind construction of the above-mentioned capital construction projects of factories and mines, resulting in huge waste? Some working comrades believe that it is difficult to be precise because they have taken over the mess of the bureaucratic capital of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the difficulties are great. Some working comrades also believe that on the basis of this mess, there are few cadres and few engineering personnel, and the tasks are heavy, so they can only rush to construct, resulting in waste. In fact, the real reason is: some working comrades came from the army or local work and are relatively unfamiliar with industry; and the idea of the supply system has not been eliminated, so they have a more serious purely task-oriented view, and they want engineering personnel to design and construct based solely on subjective wishes. Some even started construction without the approval of higher authorities, resulting in losses. There is also the idea of "just wanting money" and "the more money the better," which has resulted in the loss of stockpiling large amounts of funds. They do not know how to investigate and research, and they are not good at following the mass line. For example, the Nanchang Power Plant project, although the workers raised objections, they did not pay attention to them or adopt them, resulting in repeated mistakes.

In terms of engineering personnel, most of them hold the employment view of "the superiors manage the plan, we manage the project," acting according to old data and old plans, and designing based on American and British textbook theories, so they cannot meet the actual situation of the mineral deposits, nor can they make the design accurate. For example, the Xiejiatang New Well project of Xiangjiang Coal Mine, the Xinda Well project of Pingxiang Coal Mine, and the Dajishan Concentrator project were all designed and constructed based on the old data and old plans during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. For example, the design of a certain open hearth furnace project of a certain Iron and Steel Company was copied from two books, so there was no general layout, and it was only discovered by the workers after construction.

Now, the Central-South Industrial Department and its subordinate professional bureaus have organized inspection teams to inspect various places. The factories and mines they want to inspect are Pingxiang Coal Mine, a certain Iron and Steel Company, the main factories and mines of non-ferrous metals in Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, Zhengzhou and Nanchang Power Plants, Hanyang Textile Factory and Wuhan First Textile Company, etc. Their inspection goals are mainly: "blind construction without design" and "capital construction without a plan." At the same time, they also inspect design quality, project progress, whether capital construction meets production needs, and material supply.

### 中南工业部开始检查基本建设  一九五零年的基本建设浪费很大

　　中南工业部开始检查基本建设
    一九五零年的基本建设浪费很大
    中南区某些国营工厂矿山的基本建设工程，在一九五○年中，因为盲目施工，浪费严重。今年虽经纠正，但设计不周，或不按计划进行的现象，仍然存在。中南工业部及其所属各专业局，已根据政务院财政经济委员会的指示，组织检查。
    中南区各国营工厂矿山的基本建设工程，有新建的，有准备建设的，也有恢复和增加设备能力的。这些工程中的大多数，在施工前后，或者没有设计，或者设计不周，或者既设计不周又未很好检查，因而有的工程中途被迫停顿，有的修建不当，有的几次修正，返工重修，造成了国家财产的巨大浪费。其中有色金属和煤的地下矿藏的开采工程，盲目性特别严重。中南有色金属管理总局所属江西分局虔南大吉山选矿厂的建设工程，不仅工程进行迟缓，而且矿石的供应，只及选矿机效能的五分之一。大吉山新建工房，缺乏检查，竟因刮大风吹倒了一所。工程进行中，用汽车运木料，不是按需要而是按汽车大小下料，因而运到工地后，有百分之三十不能用。煤矿方面，湘江煤矿谢家塘新井工程，因水大石软，开采成本过高，中途被迫停工。萍乡煤矿新大井工程施工后，新大井砚子槽西大巷即遭老窿水淹，死工人十九人，机器设备都被淹没，中途停工两个半月，损失人民币达十四亿元。湖南中湘、永邵、湖湘等矿，也在开工后被迫相继停办，损失亦达三亿元。
    变更工程计划，返工重修，以及不按照计划进行，积压资金等现象，时有发生。南昌电厂的工程，去年应该动工；由于多次变更方针，到今年才施工；但又因设计不周，工程时间又须拖长，今年底还不能如期发电。中南某钢铁公司某号平炉的建设工程，没有总图，返工浪费也很严重。某纺织厂去年积压基本建设资金六分之五未用；郑州电厂在基本建设中也因多购了材料，积压了大量资金；有色金属矿厂方面也在去年积压了基本建设资金的三分之一。某铅锌矿新建炼锌厂，因为设计不当，又要重新改建，以致完工日期要由今年年底拖延到明年三月或是六月。
    上述各工厂矿山基本建设工程的盲目施工，造成巨大浪费，原因究竟是什么呢？有些工作同志认为是接收了国民党反动派官僚资本的烂摊子，困难大，不容易搞精确。有些工作同志又认为是在这烂摊子的基础上，干部少，工程人员少，而任务重，因之只能匆忙施工，造成了浪费。其实，真正的原因是：某些工作同志出身于部队或地方工作，初搞工业，比较生疏；而且供给制的思想尚未清除，因而有比较严重的单纯任务观点，只凭主观愿望，就要工程人员设计施工。有的竟未经上级机关批准即行动工，以致造成损失。还有“只要钱”、“钱越多越好”的思想，造成了积压大批资金的损失。他们不知道调查研究，不善于走群众路线，如南昌电厂工程，虽有工人群众提了意见，也不重视、不采纳，因而一误再误。
    在工程人员方面，大多是抱着“上级管计划，我们管工程”的雇佣观点，凭旧资料、旧计划行事，凭美国英国书本理论设计，以致不能符合矿藏的实际情况，也不能使设计精确。如湘江煤矿谢家塘新井工程、萍乡新大井工程、大吉山选矿厂工程，都是凭借国民党反动统治时的旧资料、旧计划进行设计施工的。如某钢铁公司的某号平炉工程设计，则是从两本书上抄下来的，所以没有总图，施工后才被工人们发现。
    现在，中南工业部及其所属各专业局已经组织检查组至各地检查。他们要检查的工厂矿山是萍乡煤矿，某钢铁公司，江西、湖南、广东、广西的有色金属的主要厂矿，郑州和南昌电厂，汉阳纺织厂和武汉第一纺织公司等。他们的检查目标，主要是：“没有设计而盲目施工”，“没有计划而进行基本建设”。同时也检查设计质量、工程进度、基本建设是否配合生产需要和材料供应。
