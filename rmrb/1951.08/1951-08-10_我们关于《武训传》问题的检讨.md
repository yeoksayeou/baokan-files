　　Our Self-Criticism on the Issue of "The Life of Wu Xun"
　　Liaocheng Prefectural Cultural and Educational Section
　　Wu Xun was a native of our district's Tangyi County. In the past, from the Manchu Dynasty to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, they all greatly praised him, and the puppet Japanese regime even called him the "Saint of Beggars." These reactionary rulers attempted to use him to anesthetize the people in order to maintain their reactionary rule. This led many people to have a wrong understanding of Wu Xun, especially in the education sector, where the influence was even deeper. Due to our low political and ideological levels, we also unconsciously blindly supported and promoted Wu Xun and the "Spirit of Wu Xun," losing the people's standpoint and committing serious errors of political principle.

　　First, regarding the production of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," we played a partial role in assisting. I remember on January 24, 1950, Sun Yu, Zhao Dan, Gao Heng and others came to Liaocheng with letters of introduction from the Shandong Provincial People's Government to negotiate. We wrote them letters of introduction and instructed the Education Section of the Tangyi County People's Government to assist in the production and interview of Wu Xun's deeds.

　　Secondly, last summer, Wu Xun's successor, Wu Jindong, was introduced by the Tangyi County People's Government to our department, talking about continuing to promote the spirit of Wu Xun and raising funds to establish another Wu Xun primary school. At that time, we explained to him: "The current People's Government advocates universal education, and the development of schools has exceeded several times that of the Kuomintang reactionary period. You don't need to raise funds to run schools anymore. You can actively participate in production." However, after his firm request, we blindly agreed to him, deciding to designate a public primary school in Guan County as Wu Xun Primary School, and soliciting the opinions of the Guan County Education Section. Later, after further study, considering that there was already a provincial Wu Xun Normal School, it was not necessary to establish another Wu Xun primary school, and the plan was stopped before construction. At the same time, Wu Jindong wanted to go to the Provincial People's Government to meet Chairman Chao Zhep and Director Wang, asking us to introduce him, and we blindly issued a letter of introduction. Nearly a year passed without us realizing that this was a serious mistake, nor did we further study what kind of person Wu Xun was. It was not until the *People's Daily* issued a call for criticism of Wu Xun that our region organized study and discussion. In the process of learning, we realized the seriousness of this mistake, recognizing that Wu Xun's reactionary essence and the more that the "Spirit of Wu Xun" was expanded, the more it would corrode our revolutionary combat effectiveness. Only then did we realize that what the broad masses of people should promote is the revolutionary spirit of Song Jingshi, the leader of the working people of Tangyi, and not any "Spirit of Wu Xun."

　　In the past, we blindly and uncritically promoted Wu Xun, echoed others' opinions, and lost the people's standpoint. This is a serious error. In the future, we must thoroughly clarify Wu Xun's thought, strengthen our study of this issue; and determine that the entire region will organize teachers from various schools in July and August to conduct studies criticizing Wu Xun, and conduct self-examination in connection with personal thoughts to raise awareness; eliminate Wu Xun's thought, and prevent the recurrence of similar Wu Xun thought. At the same time, the Tangyi County People's Government is ordered to educate Wu Jindong (who has been stopped from his fundraising activities for schools) so that he can undergo labor reform by actively participating in production; and it is proposed that all those in our district who have praised Wu Xun (orally and in writing) must make public self-criticisms. We must use this study movement to draw a clear line of ideological demarcation, strengthen revolutionary combat effectiveness, and improve work ability.

　　我们关于《武训传》问题的检讨
    聊城专区文教科
    武训是我区堂邑县人，过去自满清皇朝以至蒋介石匪帮，都曾大大地赞扬过他，日伪统治也称他为“丐圣”。这些反动统治者企图利用他来麻醉人民，以保持他们的反动统治。这就使很多人对武训发生了错误的认识。特别在教育界中，受其影响更深。我们由于政治水平、思想水平不高，也不自觉地盲目支持、宣传了武训和“武训精神”，失掉了人民的立场，犯了严重的政治原则性的错误。
    首先是关于电影《武训传》的摄制，我们曾起了部分的协助作用。记得在一九五○年一月二十四日，孙瑜、赵丹、高衡等人持山东省人民政府的介绍信来聊城接洽，我们给他们写了介绍信，并责成堂邑县人民政府教育科协助进行摄制、采访有关武训的事迹。
    其次是在去年夏天，武训的继承人武金栋，由堂邑县人民政府介绍来本科，谈及继续发扬武训精神，再募捐建立武训小学一处。当时我们给他解释：“现人民政府提倡普及教育，学校发展已超过国民党反动时期几倍，不用你再募捐办学了。你可以积极地参加生产。”但经他坚决要求，我们就盲目地答应了他，确定在冠县划公立小学一处，改为武训小学，并征求冠县教育科意见；后又研究既有省立武训师范，不须要再建立一处武训小学，停止未建。同时，武金栋要到省人民政府去见晁哲甫主席、王厅长，要求我们介绍，我们也就盲目地开了介绍信。这事过了将近一年的时间，我们也没发觉这是一个严重的错误，也没进一步研究武训到底是个什么人物。及至《人民日报》提出对武训批判的号召后，我们地区才组织了学习讨论。在学习过程中，我们认识到这一错误的严重性，认识到武训的反动本质，“武训精神”越扩大，就越会腐蚀我们革命的战斗力；才认识到广大人民所要发扬的，应该是堂邑劳动人民领袖宋景诗的革命精神，而不是什么“武训精神”。
    我们过去是盲目地毫无分析地宣扬了武训，人云亦云，失掉了人民的立场，这是严重的错误行为。今后我们要彻底地澄清武训思想，加强我们对这一问题的学习；并确定全区于七、八月份组织各校教员，进行批判武训的学习，并结合个人思想进行检查，提高认识；肃清武训思想，杜绝类似武训思想的再来侵袭。同时，令堂邑县人民政府对武金栋（已停止其募捐兴学活动）进行教育，使他从积极参加生产中进行劳动改造；并提出我区凡歌颂过武训（口头及文字）的人，都必须作公开的检讨。我们要通过这次学习运动，划清思想界线，加强革命的战斗性，提高工作能力。
