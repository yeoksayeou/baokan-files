　　越南人民军在承天省
    歼法军一千缴获甚多
    【新华社十七日讯】据越南通讯社迟到消息：越南人民军于七月二十六日在中越承天省击溃了法军三个营，歼灭法军约一千人。那一天，当向该省省会南方十公里的富荣县前进的法军在沿途抢掠时，人民军出其不意地发动猛攻。敌军仓皇溃逃。人民军计击毙敌军四百七十人，击伤敌军三百九十人，俘虏九十人。俘虏中有法军的一个副营长堤普安少校。据不完全的统计，人民军缴获的武器有迫击炮两门、机枪二十挺、卡宾枪四支、步枪七十支、电台一部和大量弹药。这是承天省人民军于今年三月十一日在该省北部地区歼灭敌军二千人后获得的第二次大胜利。
    八月六日，越南人民军地方部队在中越南部昆嵩省拔除了法军据点康龙（译音），歼灭该处全部敌守军一个连以上，缴获其全部武器。康龙是法军的一个战略据点，该处法军经常威胁着广义省西部和广安省西南部。
    越南中部广安省的人民军地方部队、民兵和游击队，现正积极参加拔除法军碉堡的战斗。
