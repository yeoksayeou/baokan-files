　　The Yellow River's Middle Reaches Experience a Surge in Floodwaters
    Flood Control Headquarters Issues Urgent Notice
    Downstream Areas Mobilize Tensely to Guard Dikes
    In recent days, the Yellow River's middle reaches have experienced a surge in floodwaters. People along the lower reaches of the Yellow River are now closely monitoring flood changes and intensifying their efforts to guard the dikes.
    In the Yulin area of Shaanxi Province, which belongs to the Wuding River basin, a tributary of the Yellow River, torrential rain fell suddenly from midnight on the 14th to the morning of the 15th, reaching 162.2 millimeters, causing a sharp rise in floodwaters in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. On the 15th, the water level of the Yellow River at Longmen in Shanxi Province rose sharply by six meters, exceeding the water level of the Yellow River at that location in any previous year. The maximum flow rate reached 25,000 cubic meters per second. Consequently, the riverbank of the Yellow River in that area has collapsed significantly recently. At 11:30 PM on the 16th, the Yellow River flood peak reached Shanzhou, with a flow rate of 8,600 cubic meters per second, and the water level exceeded the highest flood level in July 1949 by four centimeters. According to a report from the Yellow River Huayuankou hydrological station at 8:00 PM on the 17th, when the flood peak reached Huayuankou, the flow rate was 7,980 cubic meters per second, and the water level was close to the highest flood level in July 1949. Currently, the water level of the Yellow River at Huayuankou continues to rise.
    Based on the above situation, the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters has issued an urgent notice to the flood control headquarters of Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, as well as the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, urging them to intensify the protection of the dikes in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The masses on both banks of the river in the lower reaches of the Yellow River have now been mobilized urgently. Flood control personnel at each dike section have gone on duty to inspect. Fixed personnel have been assigned to guard dike sections that are not strong enough. Residents within five li of the river and the rescue teams of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission are currently intensifying the preparation of flood control materials and tools, ready to be dispatched at any time.

　　黄河中游洪水猛涨
    防汛总指挥部发出紧急通知
    下游沿岸紧张动员守护堤防
    近数日来，黄河中游洪水猛涨，黄河下游沿岸人民现正严密注意洪水变化，加紧守护堤防。
    属于黄河支流无定河流域的陕西省榆林地区，本月十四日午夜到十五日上午突降暴雨达一六二点二公厘，致使黄河中游洪水猛涨。十五日，黄河在山西龙门的水位骤然上涨六公尺，超过该处黄河以往任何一年的水位，其最大流量曾达到二万五千秒立方公尺。因此，该处黄河的河岸最近坍塌甚多。十六日晚十一时三十分黄河洪峰到达陕州，当时陕州的流量为八千六百秒立方公尺，水位超过该处一九四九年七月份最高洪水位四公分。据十七日晚八时黄河花园口水文站报告，洪峰到达花园口时，花园口流量为七千九百八十秒公方，水位已与该处黄河一九四九年七月份的最高洪水位相近。目前，花园口黄河水位仍在继续上涨。
    根据以上情况，黄河防汛总指挥部已经紧急通知黄河下游的河南、平原、山东三省防汛指挥部和黄河河务局，要他们加紧守护黄河下游的堤防。黄河下游沿河两岸的群众现在也已紧张地动员起来，各堤段的防汛员都已经上堤巡查。堤身不够坚固的堤段，现均设有固定人员把守。沿河五里以内的群众和黄河水利委员会的抢险队目前正在加紧准备防汛物料和工具，准备随时出动。
