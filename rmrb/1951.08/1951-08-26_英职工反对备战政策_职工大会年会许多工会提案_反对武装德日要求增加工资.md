Xinhua News Agency, London, 25th. – The British Trades Union Congress (TUC) will hold its 83rd annual meeting in Blackpool from September 3rd to 7th. The complete agenda for this year's annual meeting was announced on the 21st. Despite the manipulation and suppression by right-wing trade union leaders, many of the union proposals included in the agenda still reflect the profound dissatisfaction of the broad masses of British workers with the Labour government's disastrous policy of war preparations.

　　The Chemical Workers' Union, the Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen, the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, the Foundry Workers' Union, and others have put forward proposals criticizing the Labour government's policy of expanding armaments, opposing the rearmament of Germany and Japan, and protesting against the conclusion of an alliance with Franco's Spain. The Foundry Workers' Union also demanded that the United States be prevented from interfering in British trade policy.

　　In the entire agenda of the annual meeting, proposals calling for the restriction of profits and the prevention of price increases occupy a prominent position. Demands for wage increases are also widely reflected in various proposals. In fact, national trade unions across Britain have now put forward demands for wage increases. Even the National Union of Transport and General Workers and the National Union of Municipal and General Workers, which have always been controlled by reactionary scabs, supported a resolution demanding an increase of one pound per week in wages at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions on the 15th.

　　However, the General Council of the TUC, which is controlled by right-wing trade union leaders, continues to support the Labour government's policy of betraying the interests of the working class, regardless of the demands of its eight million members. In its annual report published on the 20th, the General Council unconditionally accepted the Labour government's massive arms expansion plan and war preparation deployments that seriously damage the living standards of British workers.

　　Commenting on the upcoming TUC annual meeting, the London "Daily Worker" pointed out: "There is unanimous dissatisfaction with the unrestricted rise in profits and prices," "It would be extremely foolish if the government and the TUC General Council ignore this and act against this irresistible wave of opposition."

　　英职工反对备战政策
    职工大会年会许多工会提案
    反对武装德日要求增加工资
    【新华社二十五日讯】伦敦讯：英国职工大会将于九月三日到七日在布拉克浦举行第八十三届年会。本届年会的全部议程已于二十一日公布。尽管有右翼工会头子们的操纵和压制，议程中所包括的许多工会的提案，仍然反映出广大英国工人群众对于工党政府灾难性的备战政策的深刻不满。
    化学工人工会、机器和造船业设计师协会、建筑工人工会、翻砂工人工会等都提出提案，抨击工党政府的扩张军备政策，反对重新武装德国和日本，抗议与佛朗哥西班牙缔结同盟。翻砂工人工会并要求制止美国干涉英国贸易政策。
    在年会的全部议程中，要求限制利润和制止物价上涨的提案，占据显著的地位。增加工资的要求也广泛地反映在各个提案中。事实上，英国全国各工会目前都已提出增加工资的要求。甚至一向为反动工贼所控制的全国最大的运输与普通工人工会以及全国市政与普通工人工会，也在十五日举行的英国造船与机器工会联合会的年会中，支持要求增加每周工资一英镑的决议案。
    然而，为右翼工会头子所把持的职工大会最高委员会，却不顾八百万会员的要求，仍在支持工党政府叛卖工人阶级利益的政策。最高委员会在二十日发表的年度报告中，毫无异议地接受了工党政府庞大的扩军计划和严重损害英国工人生活水平的备战部署。
    伦敦“工人日报”在评论即将到来的职工大会年会时指出：“人们对于利润和物价的毫无限制的上涨一致感到不满”，“如果政府和职工大会最高委员会对此不予注意，并且不顾这种势不可当的反对情绪而行事，那就是极端愚蠢的。”
