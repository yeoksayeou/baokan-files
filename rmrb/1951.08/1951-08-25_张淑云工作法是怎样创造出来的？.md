In the patriotic emulation campaign, the broad masses of workers in Tianjin demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and competed to create various advanced working methods, hoping to make greater contributions to the motherland. The working method of "concentrating advantages and universally promoting" created by Zhang Shuyun, a female worker at the Tianjin Hengda Tobacco Factory, was produced under the encouragement of this patriotic enthusiasm.

Zhang Shuyun is a female worker in the factory's middle packaging department, a Communist Party member, and a special-class labor model in the city. In May of this year, after the municipal government issued the regulations for evaluating labor models, she thought: Since joining the Communist Party, the Party has continuously educated me: As a labor model, it is not only important to produce well myself, but more importantly, to be able to unite everyone to improve production together. But how can this requirement be achieved? The group system has been established, and everyone's labor intensity has been utilized almost to the maximum. To increase output further, it is necessary to improve operating methods. How to improve? She repeatedly considered this issue. Later, she thought: Besides herself, there are two other people in the middle packaging department who wrap cigarettes the fastest: Feng Wenzhen and Jiao Guizhi. She wraps quickly because she grabs cigarettes faster than others; what is the reason they wrap quickly? She decided to find out the reason.

She used every spare moment to observe and compare the working methods of Feng Wenzhen and Jiao Guizhi. As a result, she found that they each had their own characteristics in the small movements of wrapping cigarettes and were much faster than others. Feng Wenzhen's advantage was that when covering the tin foil corners, both thumbs and index fingers moved simultaneously. Jiao Guizhi's advantage was that when loading cigarettes, she first loaded one corner of the tin foil package into the box, and then quickly loaded it in with a twist of her hand. When others were loading one box, she had already finished loading two boxes. This, combined with Zhang Shuyun's own cigarette grabbing method, was almost the entire operating process of the middle packaging department. She thought, "If these three advantages are combined and put into one person, how much would efficiency increase!" After figuring this out, she jumped up with joy and immediately went to the chairman of the trade union, put forward her opinion, and received the full support of the trade union chairman.

Zhang Shuyun's activity of creating advanced working methods started with mobilizing Feng Wenzhen and Jiao Guizhi to make their techniques public.

She used the lunch break to talk to Feng Wenzhen, and waited for her at the factory gate to go home together when the spare-time school was over. The two gradually became familiar. Zhang Shuyun said to her, "There are not many people in our department who wrap more than 2,000 packs. I think your corner covering method is the fastest. If you can teach everyone, the output of our department will definitely increase." Seeing that she did not express any opposition, Zhang Shuyun continued, "I am planning to organize a technical research group and invite the workers in our department who produce well to be teachers. Will you give everyone a lecture on the corner covering method?" After her mobilization, Feng Wenzhen agreed. What about Jiao Guizhi? Her output has always been the highest in the middle packaging department and she is a labor model in the factory; however, she doesn't like to approach people and goes home after work. It is somewhat difficult to get her to make her technology public. However, Zhang Shuyun patiently talked to her again and again, "Labor models should take the lead and unite everyone to improve production together." Gradually, Jiao Guizhi's mind opened up, and she said, "Shuyun, you are right, I will join the technical research group!" Later, with the help of the trade union, Zhang Shuyun mobilized twelve activists and organized the technical research group.

On June 20, the technical research group was established. Zhang Shuyun and the other two each spent one hour a day taking turns to teach everyone new operating methods. Everyone studied very enthusiastically. After two days, Zhang Shuyun remembered that the entire operating process of the middle packaging department included four actions: grabbing cigarettes, covering corners, loading cigarettes, and closing the lid. There were good methods for the first three, but closing the lid was not good enough. They began to pay attention to everyone's lid closing method within the technical research group, and as a result, they found that Yu Guilan closed the lid the fastest. Her advantage is that the index finger brings the tin foil and the middle finger brings the box lid, and the two actions are done together, which saves exactly half the time compared to others doing it in two steps. After research, everyone began to learn Yu Guilan's "lid closing method." With the support of the trade union and the administration, the work of the research group proceeded smoothly. The administrative side provided tin foil, cigarettes, boxes, and other materials for them to practice. After eleven days, the workers in the research group learned the new operating methods. Some workers began to show new performance in production. For example, Wang Shuqin used to pack a maximum of 2,200 packs, but after learning the new operating method, she increased it to 2,400 packs and later reached 2,600 packs. Zhang Shuyun's confidence was even higher at this time. She wanted to expand this research group so that every worker would learn this "excellent operating method," so she went to the chairman of the trade union to explain her plan. The chairman of the trade union enthusiastically encouraged her and told her that this method of concentrating advantages is in line with the characteristics of the Soviet Kovalev working method.

After the chairman of the trade union, the factory director, and the Communist Party branch secretary studied the matter at a meeting, they believed that this working method was very valuable and should be widely promoted. Therefore, the factory director sent technicians to go deep into the workshop to help the technical research group measure working hours. The research results proved that this new operating method was indeed superior to any other individual's working method. Therefore, the trade union issued a call, mobilizing all workers in the factory to learn this advanced working method, and determined that it would be fully implemented in the middle packaging department and selectively implemented in other departments.

Although the method was good, not everyone was willing to learn it at the beginning. Zhang Shuyun wondered what the reason was. She convened a meeting of the technical research group to study the matter, and as a result, she found that other workers had concerns. Some workers with relatively skilled techniques had daily output that was "better than the bottom, but not as good as the top," and they felt that they could not always compare with the high achievers. Some said, "If we learn it, and don't learn it well, we will earn tens of thousands less a month!" Others started learning with great enthusiasm, but after a few days, their output did not increase, and they lost heart. Some used the new operating method in the morning, but changed back to the old way in the afternoon, fearing that they would produce less. As for the workers who originally had very low output, they actively participated in learning. For these workers with concerns, Zhang Shuyun and Feng Wenzhen, Jiao Guizhi and others, with the help of the trade union, carried out publicity and explanation separately. The trade union used all the publicity tools in the factory, such as wall newspapers and radio broadcasts. They repeatedly explained to the workers, "Even if the output decreases slightly, it is only a short-term thing. Once you are proficient, you will produce more, which is good for the country and for yourself." At the same time, Zhang Shuyun used concrete examples to educate everyone. For example, Zhang Xiaofeng and Zhao Peizhong packed three to four hundred packs less each day when they started learning, but they persisted in learning, and now they have increased their output by one hundred packs compared to the original. Wang Jiwen, whose output decreased when he started learning, was encouraged by their influence and is now completely proficient, increasing his output by four hundred packs compared to before. After using concrete practical examples for publicity and education, a large number of workers participated in the learning. There are now 187 people participating in the learning in the middle packaging department, and more than 50% of the workers have increased their output. Among them, three people have increased their average daily output by 400 packs, and seventy-three people have increased their output by 100 to 300 packs, while Zhang Shuyun, Feng Wenzhen, and others have all created the highest record of 2,600 packs.

　　张淑云工作法是怎样创造出来的？
    新华社记者  孟帆
    在爱国竞赛公约运动中，天津市广大职工表现了高度的爱国主义精神，竞先创造各种先进工作方法，希望对祖国有更多贡献。天津恒大烟草厂女工张淑云所创造的“集中优点、普遍推广”的工作方法，就是在这种爱国热情的鼓舞下产生的。
    张淑云是该厂中包部女工，共产党员，市特等劳动模范。今年五月，市人民政府发布评选劳动模范条例后，她想：自从加入共产党后，党就不断地教育自己：作为一个劳动模范不仅自己要生产好，重要的是能够团结大伙儿一齐把生产搞好。但是怎样才能实现这一要求呢？小组的制度都建立起来了，每个人的劳动强度也发挥得差不多了，再要提高产量就非改进操作方法不可。怎么改进呢？她反复地考虑这个问题。后来想到：在中包部包烟最快的除她自己外，还有冯文贞、焦桂枝两个人。自己包得快是因为抓烟比别人快；她们包得快是什么原因呢？她决定要找出这个道理来。
    她每天利用空隙，出来进去地观察、比较着冯文贞、焦桂枝两个人的工作法。结果发现她们在包烟的细小动作上都有特点，都比别人快得多。冯文贞的优点是在掩锡纸折角的时候，两个手的拇指和食指同时动作。焦桂枝的优点是在装烟的时候，把锡纸包的一角先装入盒内，然后用手一扭就很快地装进去，别人装一盒时，她已装完两盒。这样再加上张淑云自己的抓烟法，差不多就是中包部的全部操作过程了。她想：“如果把这三个优点合并起来，放在一个人身上，那效率不定提高多少呢！”她想通了以后，高兴得跳起来，马上去找工会主席，提出了她的意见，并且得到了工会主席的全力支持。
    张淑云创造先进工作法的活动，先从动员冯文贞和焦桂枝公开技术开始。
    她利用中午休息的时间去找冯文贞谈，业余学校放学的时候，在工厂门口等着她一同回家。两个人逐渐熟了。张淑云就对她说：“咱们部里包二千包以上的人不多，我看你的掩角法最快，要能教给大家，我们部里的产量一定会提高。”张淑云看她没有表示反对，又接下去说：“我正想组织一个技术研究组，请咱们部的生产好的工人当老师，你给大家讲掩角法，行不行？”经过她的动员，冯文贞同意了。焦桂枝呢？她的产量一向是在中包部数第一，是厂里的劳动模范；可是她不大爱接近人，下了班就回家。想叫她把技术公开是有些困难的。但是张淑云耐心地一次又一次地跟她谈：“劳动模范应该起带头作用，团结大家一齐搞好生产。”慢慢地焦桂枝的脑筋开了窍，她说：“淑云，你说得对，我加入技术研究组好了！”以后，张淑云又在工会的帮助下，动员了十二个积极分子，把技术研究组组织了起来。
    六月二十日，技术研究组开始成立了。张淑云等三个人每天抽出一小时轮流给大家讲新的操作法。大家学得很起劲。过了两天，张淑云想起：中包部全部操作过程包括四个动作：抓烟、掩角、装烟、盖盖。前三个好的方法都有了，可是盖盖还不行。她们就开始在技术研究组内注意每个人的盖盖方法，结果发现于桂兰盖盖最快。她的优点是由食指带锡纸，中指带盒盖，两个动作一齐作好，比别人分两次做恰恰节省一半时间。经过研究大家便开始学习于桂兰的“盖盖法”。在工会和行政的支持下，研究组的工作进行得很顺利。行政方面拿出锡纸、纸烟、盒子等材料让她们练习。经过十一天，研究组工人都学会了新的操作方法。有的工人开始在生产上有了新的表现。如王淑琴过去最多包两千二百包，学会新操作法后，提高到两千四百包，后来达到两千六百包。张淑云这时信心更高了。她想扩大这个研究组，让每个工人都会这种“优良操作法”，于是他去找工会主席，说明了自己的打算。工会主席热情地鼓励了她，并且告诉她说：这种集中优点的方法，和苏联郭瓦廖夫工作法的特点正相符合。
    工会主席，厂长与共产党支部书记在碰头会上研究后，认为这个工作法很有价值，应该广泛推行。于是厂长派技术人员深入车间帮助技术研究小组测量工时，研究结果证明这个新操作方法确实比其他任何个人的工作法优越。于是工会发出号召，动员全厂工人来学习这个先进工作方法，确定中包部全面推行，其他各部重点试行。
    方法虽好，开始时并不是每个人都愿意学习。张淑云想这是什么原因呢？她召开了技术研究组会议研究，结果发现是其他工人有顾虑。一部分技术相当熟练的工人的日常产量都是“比上不足，比下有余”的，他们觉得不能老和高的比。有的说：“学吧，学不好一个月就少挣几万！”还有的是开始学时劲头很大，几天过去了产量没增加，就泄劲了。有的是上午用新的操作法，下午又改了老样，怕少出活。至于原来产量很低的工人们，都积极参加学习。对于这些有顾虑的工人，张淑云和冯文贞、焦桂枝等几个人在工会帮助下，分别进行了宣传解释。工会把全厂的壁报、广播等一切宣传工具都利用起来。反复向工人们说明：“即使产量有些降低也是短时期的事情，一旦熟练了就会多出活，对国家、对自己都有好处。”同时张淑云利用具体事例来教育大家。如张小凤、赵佩忠开始学习时每天少包三、四百包，但是他们坚持学习，现在已经比原来的产量增加了一百包。开始学习时降低了产量的王继文在他们的影响下鼓起勇气，现在已经完全熟练，产量较前提高了四百包。经过用具体的实际事例进行宣传教育，大批工人才参加了学习。中包部现在参加学习的已有一百八十七人，其中已有百分之五十以上的工人提高了产量。其中平均每天增加产量四百包的有三个人，一百包到三百包的有七十三个人，而张淑云、冯文贞等都创造了两千六百包的最高纪录。
