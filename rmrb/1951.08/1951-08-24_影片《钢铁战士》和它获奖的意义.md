　　The Film "Steel Soldier" and the Significance of its Award
       Huang Gang
    "Steel Soldier" has won an award. At this annual international film festival, other films from our country that simultaneously received special honorary awards include the feature film "The White Haired Girl," the documentary "The Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities," and the director of "New Heroes and Heroines," Shi Dongshan. In 1950, the film "Daughters of China" from the People's Republic of China already won the fourth prize—the Freedom Struggle Award—at this international film festival. This year, "Steel Soldier" won the Peace Prize—the second prize at the Sixth International Film Festival.

    This fact demonstrates that the people's film art of the new China under the literary and artistic line of Mao Zedong has emerged and appeared on the world film stage; it demonstrates that our country's people's film industry has made full progress over the past year; it demonstrates that our country's progressive films, once appearing in the world's progressive film camp headed by Soviet films, become an important force on the cultural front fighting for peace, democracy, and progress. The awards of these films from our country also reflect the important position of our young republic in the international arena.

    Why was our country's film "Steel Soldier" able to receive such an honor?

    As early as June, before "Steel Soldier" was screened in Moscow, the Soviet Film Administration held a meeting to discuss this film. On June 26, Belyavsky published a review of this film in the "Soviet Art Newspaper," titled "Loyalty Produces Heroism." The author pointed out that Steel Soldier "tells a moving story of fortitude and heroism born of loyalty. The film teaches people to maintain and promote the glorious traditions of the Chinese people in the liberation struggle, and to teach the people to resolutely defend the happiness won through struggle with the spirit of loyalty to the cause of freedom, and not to allow any imperialist infringement." I believe this is a good analysis of the theme of "Steel Soldier" and also states the most important reason why this film can win the Peace Prize.

    Because, for the people of the whole world today, what "Steel Soldier" narrates is not ordinary people or ordinary things; what it narrates is the story of ordinary commanders and fighters, yet great and just warriors and communists, in the heroic troops and world-renowned troops—the Chinese People's Liberation Army; what it depicts is the story of the loyal sons and daughters of our great motherland, armed soldiers and conscious people being tested on the battlefield, in court, and in prison; therefore, what the film reveals is a question of essence. Comrade Mao Zedong once said the following in "On Coalition Government" regarding the purpose of our people's army:

    “To stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve them wholeheartedly; this is the sole purpose of this army.”

    “Under this purpose, this army has the spirit of advancing bravely, it must overwhelm all enemies and never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult and arduous the circumstances, as long as one person remains, that person must continue to fight.”

    The film "Steel Soldier" depicts precisely such people. The protagonists in the film all encounter difficult and arduous situations where only they are left. The enemy then threatens them: "Surrender, bow your heads, you have been captured!" But our heroes answer with action: "Never! Victory is not on your side! We will never surrender! To serve the people to the end and be loyal to the Communist Party to the end, this is our established purpose! Rather die than surrender, this is our nature!" This film, through the true performance of the actors, succinctly conveys the essence of the people's army and the soldiers, and the conclusion of Comrade Mao Zedong quoted earlier.

    Once this question of essence is revealed by a work of art through living images, it truly reflects the powerful strength of our People's Liberation Army fighting for peace and reflects a source of victory for people fighting for a just cause; therefore, it cannot but enhance the strong will of hundreds of millions of people in the world in their struggle today. This is where our film "Steel Soldier" deserves to win the Peace Prize without shame.

    However, if someone else thinks that "Steel Soldier" won the award only because of the honor of the victory of the struggle of the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, or if they separate the obvious artistic progress of the film from its correct thematic intent, this is undoubtedly incorrect. Belyavsky's review in the "Soviet Art Newspaper" is very fair. It begins by saying: "This film, both in terms of the reality of the theme and the artistic treatment of the theme, is a realistic, sincere, and simple work that is close to and understood by millions of viewers." In the eyes of our Chinese audience, this film has an engaging narrative and outstanding popularity. The writers and directors placed the fate of the heroic protagonists before the people and audiences who care about them, while at the same time making all of this a logical, educational, and especially popular treatment. This enabled the author to basically approach and grasp the fundamental principles of realism, and the director's simple artistic style was given full play. The typicality and narrative of the subject matter (which was given by the original script), and the director's simple, intimate, and easy-to-understand style, are the primary reasons why "Steel Soldier" is artistically welcomed by a wide audience.

    Secondly, the war scenes described in the film with the language of cinema have great success. Belyavsky's review correctly points out that the first half of the film vividly tells the audience: "How great the glorious soldiers are in the cause of liberating the motherland... How pure and courageous their hearts are! From the point of view of film technique, these positive episodes are handled very well... Several battle scenes intersperse close-ups of individual combat stages in panoramic views, making full use of the expressive power of the film. The pictures of each shot, the tension of the action, the clarity of the sense of rhythm, and the expression of the atmosphere of the event, all remind us of some beautiful battle scenes in Soviet films; this is also where "Steel Soldier" succeeds." These advantages are worthy of our attention and study, and should continue to be preserved and promoted in future military films; and we believe that the success of this part of the content and expression methods is closely related to the director's and his collaborators' familiarity with military life and their true love for our troops.

    The third advantage of "Steel Soldier" in artistically expressing the theme is the appropriate handling and performance of several main images and main actors. Especially the performance of the young actor Comrade Sun Yu; other positive characters are also more suitable for the situation in military struggle.

    Because of the above circumstances, the representatives of the film industry from the 18 participating countries unanimously believed after watching "Steel Soldier" that this film fully demonstrated the progress of China's film industry over the past year compared with the Chinese films that participated in the competition last year.

    The above are the main advantages or achievements of "Steel Soldier" in terms of ideological art. But it also has some shortcomings.

    One of the more significant shortcomings that still exists in the film "Steel Soldier" is that the creators do not have the power to use high-level ideas and typical images to implement or develop their thematic intentions in all its pages. The depiction of the Kuomintang reactionaries seems a bit redundant, and even feels weak. That is to say, although the film's ideological art showed a gratifying simple style and some images with profound ideological character when describing the People's Liberation Army, there are still some impurities in the aspect of life material, and in my opinion, the impurities in this creative material are due to the certain ideological restrictions encountered by the creators at that time in reflecting the struggle life. For example, the enemy described in the film is not shaped from a fundamentally characteristic situation; the introduction and interjection of the enemy's situation at that time are also far-fetched or schematic; also, when the enemy interrogates Platoon Leader Zhang, the ideological power of our side (this power can arouse the inner trembling of the enemy) is not strong enough, and the ideological advantage of our side is not clear enough in the interrogation; on the contrary, in those occasions, the authors mostly only resort to generally used torture scenes and some externally terrifying shots to conquer the audience, and attempt to strengthen the effect of the film by this. These cannot be called better methods. In all places similar to this nature, our authors still need to seek improvement in both the arming of Marxism-Leninism theory and the practice of life and creation in the future.

    The second shortcoming is that the characters' personalities are still underdeveloped. Some characters still lack a clear personality, especially the enemy officers, whose images lack distinction. These shortcomings are worthy of our attention in future creative work.

    In addition, one shortcoming in the film's music is that the scene of our army being surrounded on a moonlit night did not use an optimistic and profound tone, and the background music inappropriately rendered a sad and gloomy mood, which is not good.

    The existence of these shortcomings is extremely natural, and can be gradually overcome in future creations. Nor did it obscure the basic brilliance of this film.

    The primary significance of the award-winning film "Steel Soldier" is that it powerfully provides a clear example of the rapid growth of the new force in China's film industry under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought. Our congratulations to "Steel Soldier" and other Chinese entries competing in the international film festival are congratulations to the victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line; it is yet another fact that illustrates the great power of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in terms of ideological guidance.

    Another significance of the award of "Steel Soldier" is that it specifically proves the gradual increase in the ability of our country's film workers to reflect our country's military struggle life and the heroic image of the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army, which is the main tool of the Chinese people's revolution, and its nurturers and organizers—the Communist Party of China's thirty years of rich, diverse, and victorious struggle life—urgently awaits our literary and artistic and film workers to make multi-faceted and more successful reflections.

### 影片《钢铁战士》和它获奖的意义

　　影片《钢铁战士》和它获奖的意义
       黄钢
    《钢铁战士》得奖了。在这一年一度的国际电影赛会上，我国参加比赛的影片同时获有特别荣誉奖的，还有故事片《白毛女》、纪录片《中国民族大团结》，以及《新儿女英雄传》的导演史东山等。一九五○年，我中华人民共和国已有影片《中华女儿》在这国际电影节上获得了第四奖——自由斗争奖。今年，《钢铁战士》是荣获和平奖——即六届国际电影赛会的第二奖。
    这个事实，说明了在毛泽东文艺路线下的新中国的人民电影艺术，已经脱颖而出，出现在世界影坛之上；说明了我国人民电影事业，一年来获得了充分的进展；说明了我国的进步电影，一旦出现在以苏联电影为首的世界进步电影阵营中，它就在文化战线上成为为和平、民主与进步而斗争的重要力量。我国这些影片的得奖，同时也反映出我们年青的共和国在国际上的重要地位。
    为什么我国的影片《钢铁战士》能获得这样的荣誉呢？
    早在今年六月当《钢铁战士》在莫斯科放映之前，苏联电影事业部曾集会讨论了这部影片，六月二十六日，白里亚夫斯基在《苏联艺术报》上发表了对这部影片的评论，题名是《忠贞产生了英勇》，作者指出：钢铁战士“叙述了一个由于忠贞而产生了刚毅英勇的令人感动的故事。影片教导人们去保持和发扬中国人民在解放斗争中的光荣传统，以忠实于自由事业的精神来教导人民坚决地保卫斗争得来的幸福，不容任何帝国主义者的侵犯。”我认为，这是对于《钢铁战士》的主题思想的一个好分析，并且也说出了这部影片能获得和平奖的最主要原因。
    因为，对于今天全世界的人民说来，《钢铁战士》所叙述的不是普通的人物，和普通的事情；它所叙述的，是英雄的部队、举世闻名的部队——中国人民解放军中普通的指战员、然而又是伟大的、正义的斗士、共产党员的故事；它所描写的，是我们伟大祖国忠实的儿女，武装的战士和觉悟的人民在战场上、在法庭上、在监狱中受考验的故事；因此影片所揭示的，就是有关本质的问题。毛泽东同志在《论联合政府》中，曾这样说到我们人民的军队的宗旨：
    “紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，这就是这个军队的唯一宗旨。”
    “在这个宗旨下面，这个军队具有一往直前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还存在一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”
    影片《钢铁战士》所描写的正是这样的人。片中的主角们都遇到了只剩下他一个人的艰难困苦情况。敌人那时对他们威胁道：“你们投降吧，低头吧，你们已经被俘虏了！”但是我们的英雄们用行动回答说：“决不！胜利决不在你们那一边！我们是决不会投降的！为人民服务到底、对共产党忠诚到底，这就是我们既定的宗旨！宁死不屈，这就是我们的本性！”这部影片，就是通过了演员的真实表演，将人民军队与战士的这种本质，将前面所引用的毛泽东同志的论断，扼要地传达出来了。
    这种本质的问题，一经过艺术作品通过了生活形象来加以揭露，就真实地反映出我人民解放军为和平而斗争的雄厚力量，就反映出为正义事业而斗争的人们的一个胜利的源泉；因此，它就不得不增强了今天亿万世界人民在斗争中的坚强意志力。这就是我们的影片《钢铁战士》荣获和平奖而毫无愧色的地方。
    但是，假如另有人认为《钢铁战士》获奖，仅因为是我国人民与人民解放军斗争胜利的荣誉所致，或是把该片艺术上显然的进展与它正确的主题意图分开来看，这无疑的是不正确的。《苏联艺术报》上白里亚夫斯基的评论非常之公允，它开头就说：“这部影片不论在主题的现实性上或是对主题的艺术处理上，都是一部现实主义的，真挚朴实的，是接近千百万观众并为他们所理解的作品。”在我们中国观众看来，这部影片有着引人的故事性与杰出的通俗性。编导者把英雄主角的命运，放在关怀他们的人民观众面前，同时又将这一切，作了合乎逻辑的、能够教育人的、特别是非常通俗化的处理。这就使作者从基本上接近和掌握了现实主义的根本原则，使得导演者朴实的艺术风格，得到了充分的发挥。题材的典型性和故事性（这是原剧本的基础所给予的），和导演风格的朴实、亲切、和易懂，是《钢铁战士》在艺术上能够使广泛的观众欢迎的首要原因。
    其次一点，就是影片中用电影的语言所描述的战争情节，有着很大的成功。白里亚夫斯基的评论正确地指出影片的前半部生动地告诉了观众：“光荣的战士们在解放祖国的事业中是如何伟大……他们的心灵是多么纯洁，多么果敢啊！如就电影技巧的观点来评价，这几个正面的插曲是处理得非常完善的。……几个战斗场面在全景中穿插个别战斗阶段的特写镜头，充分利用了电影的表现能力。各个镜头的画面，动作的紧张，节奏感的明确以及事件气氛的表达，在在都使我们回忆起苏联影片一些美好的战斗场面；这也是《钢铁战士》成功的地方。”这些优点，很值得我们注意和学习，应在将来的军事影片中继续保存和发扬；而我们认为这一部分内容与表达方法的成功，是与导演人和他的合作者对于军事生活的熟悉，及他们对于我们部队的真实热爱，有着密切联系的。
    《钢铁战士》从艺术上表达主题思想的第三个优点是若干主要形象与主要演员处理与表演的适当。特别是年幼演员孙羽同志的表演；其它正面人物，也比较适合于在军事斗争中的情况。
    就是因为以上这些情况，所以与会的十八个国家的电影界代表，在看了《钢铁战士》后一致认为：这部影片和去年参加比赛的中国电影相比，充分说明了一年来中国电影事业的进展。
    上面就是《钢铁战士》影片思想艺术方面主要的优点或成就。但它也还有一些缺点。
    《钢铁战士》影片仍然存在着的一个较显著的缺点，是创作者们没有力量在它的一切篇幅中，用高度的思想和典型的形象去贯彻或发挥他们的主题意图。描写国民党反动派的时候，显得有些累赘，甚至觉得软弱无力。这就是说，影片的思想艺术上虽然在描写解放军这方面时出现了可喜的朴实的风格，和某些具有深刻思想性的形象，但还存在着一部分或另一方面生活材料方面的杂质，这种创作材料中的杂质，在我看来，是由于创作者在反映斗争生活方面当时是遇有一定的思想限制所产生的。例如影片中所描写的敌人，不是从具有根本性质的场合去塑造形象；当时敌我形势的介绍及插写，也都牵强或图式化；还有在敌人审讯张排长时，表现出来的我方思想威力（这种威力是能够引起敌人内心的战栗的）还不够强，我方在思想上的优势，在审讯中还不够显明；相反的，在那些场合，作者们还多半只是借助于一般惯用的酷刑场面，以及一些外形恐怖的镜头来征服观众，并企图以此来加强影片的效果。这些都不能称之为较好的方法。所有类似这一种性质的地方，我们的作者今后仍需要在马列主义理论的武装和生活、创作实践双方面去求得提高。
    第二个缺点是人物的性格还欠发展。有些人物还缺乏明确的个性，特别是敌人军官，他们的形象缺乏区别。这些缺点，是值得我们在今后的创作工作中注意的。
    此外，这部电影音乐中的一个缺点，是在我军被包围的月夜一场没有运用一种乐观深沉的基调，背景乐曲在这里不适当地渲染了一种忧伤阴暗的情绪，这是不好的。
    这些缺点的存在，是极其自然，而且在将来创作中是可以逐步克服的。也没有把这部影片的基本光辉之处掩盖起来。
    《钢铁战士》影片获奖的首要意义，是它有力地提供了我国电影界新生力量在毛主席文艺思想指导下迅速成长的鲜明例证。我们祝贺《钢铁战士》及我国其它等等在国际电影节上参加竞赛的胜利，就是祝贺毛泽东文艺路线的胜利；就是一次又一次的事实又说明了毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”在思想指导方面的巨大力量。
    《钢铁战士》的获奖的又一意义，又是具体地证明了我国的电影工作者反映我国军事斗争生活与人民解放军英雄形象能力的逐步增长。作为中国人民革命主要工具的人民解放军，以及它的哺育者与组织者——中国共产党三十年来丰富多样与胜利的斗争生活，迫切地等待我们文学艺术与电影工作者去作出多方面的、更为成功的反映。
