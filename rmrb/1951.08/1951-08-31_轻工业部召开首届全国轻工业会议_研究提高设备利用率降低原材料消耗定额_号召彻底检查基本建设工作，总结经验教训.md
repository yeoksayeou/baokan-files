　　The Central Ministry of Light Industry convened the first National Light Industry Conference from August 9th to 22nd. This conference gained an understanding of the current basic situation of light industry nationwide, determined the current tasks of light industry and the production policies for various major light industries, drafted a plan for the 1952 production control figures for various major light industries by region, reviewed and summarized the experiences and lessons in capital construction work, proposed the priorities and principles for future capital construction, and put forward several suggestions on some issues related to light industry production and construction.
    Wang Xinyuan, Vice Minister of Light Industry, pointed out in the conference summary: Over the past two years, national light industry has gone through a stage of recovery and adjustment, rapidly recovering production from overcoming difficulties, and has seen some development. The increase in rural purchasing power after the land reform, the development of material exchange between urban and rural areas, and the progress of national economic construction have opened up broad avenues for the future recovery and development of light industry. However, in most major light industries, due to the supply, production, and sales not yet being fully coordinated and balanced, except for industries such as paper making, sugar refining, and automobile tires, the equipment utilization rate is still very low, and urgently needs to be improved.
    Based on the principle of developing production by developing supply and sales, the conference meticulously studied the possibility of leveraging production capacity and increasing equipment utilization rates, and drafted the 1952 production control figures for major products of various major public and private light industries nationwide. Except for individual products, this figure is greatly higher than the estimated output for 1951.
    The conference pointed out: For the stable development of light industry in the future, it is necessary to concentrate efforts to ensure the supply of raw materials. We should cooperate with relevant departments of agriculture, forestry, trade, and heavy industry to increase the production of raw material crops, chemical raw materials, hardware, and other materials necessary for light industry, encourage innovation and invention, and promote substitutes. At the same time, we must vigorously promote the conservation of raw materials and reduce the consumption quotas for various raw materials.
    The conference discussed the direction and priorities for the future development of national light industry, especially local industry, and believed that it is necessary to expand the scope of light industry development and produce a greater variety of products to meet the needs of all parties. For example, raw material industries, especially raw material industries that previously relied on foreign imports, agricultural, local, and special product processing industries, cultural and educational supplies, and daily necessities industries, etc., can be planned and constructed by various regions after in-depth investigation and research, based on local resources, market conditions, and technical conditions.
    The conference examined the capital construction work in various regions, pointed out the achievements and shortcomings, and called on everyone to thoroughly examine, make up for the shortcomings, sum up experiences and lessons, and continuously improve and strengthen this work.
    Based on the current situation and needs of light industry, the conference separately discussed issues related to processing orders, the production and sales relationship between state-owned industries and trade departments, the supply of raw materials for light industry, the organization and leadership of handicraft production, and the training of cadres, and provided the results of the discussion to relevant parties for reference and implementation.
    A total of 249 representatives attended and participated in the conference, including representatives from the relevant commissions, ministries, administrations, and banks of the Central People's Government, representatives from the financial and economic committees and industrial departments of the major administrative regions, and representatives from the industrial bureaus and industry and commerce bureaus of key provinces and cities with relatively developed light industries. During the conference, Bo Yibo and Li Fuchun, both vice chairmen of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, gave instructions.
    At the closing ceremony, all representatives sent a special telegram to express their gratitude to Chairman Mao's correct leadership and the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

　　轻工业部召开首届全国轻工业会议
    研究提高设备利用率降低原材料消耗定额
    号召彻底检查基本建设工作，总结经验教训
    中央轻工业部自八月九日至二十二日召开了首届全国轻工业会议。这次会议了解了目前全国轻工业的基本情况，确定了目前轻工业的任务和各种主要轻工业的生产方针，拟订了一九五二年各种主要轻工业分区生产控制数字的草案，检讨并总结了基本建设工作中的经验和教训，提出了今后进行基本建设的重点和原则，并对有关轻工业生产建设的一些问题，提出了若干建议。
    轻工业部副部长王新元在会议总结中指出：两年来，全国轻工业经过了恢复和调整的阶段，从克服困难中迅速恢复了生产，并有了部分的发展。土地改革后农村购买力的提高，城乡物资交流的开展以及国家经济建设的进行，已经给轻工业今后的恢复和发展开辟了广阔的道路。但在目前各种主要轻工业中，由于供、产、销还没有完全配合平衡，除了造纸、制糖、汽车轮胎等工业外，大部分设备利用率还很低，亟待提高。
    会议根据从发展供、销来发展生产的方针，缜密研究了发挥生产能力，提高设备利用率的可能性，拟订了全国公私营主要轻工业各主要产品一九五二年的生产控制数字，除了个别产品外，这个数字较之一九五一年预计产量已大大提高。
    会议指出：为了轻工业今后的稳固发展，必须集中力量保证原材料的供应，应与农林、贸易、重工业等有关部门相配合，增加生产轻工业所必需的原料作物和化工原料、五金器材等，奖励创造发明并推广代用品，同时更要厉行原材料的节约，降低各种原材料消耗定额。
    会议讨论了全国轻工业，特别是地方工业今后发展的方向和重点，认为必须扩大轻工业发展的范围，生产更多种类的产品，以供应各方面的需要。诸如原材料工业，特别是过去依赖国外进口的原材料工业，农、土、特产的加工工业，文教用品及日用品工业等，各地可以经过深入的调查研究，根据当地的资源、市场情况、技术条件等，有计划地进行建设。
    会议检查了各地区的基本建设工作，指出了成绩和缺点，并号召大家彻底检查，弥补缺点，总结经验教训，不断地改进与加强这一工作。
    根据轻工业当前的情况及其需要，会议分别讨论了有关加工订货、国营工业和贸易部门之间的产销关系、轻工业原材料的供应、手工业生产的组织和领导、干部培养等问题，并将讨论结果提供有关方面参考和执行。
    出席和列席这次会议的代表共有二百四十九人，包括中央人民政府各有关委、部、署、行的代表，各大行政区财政经济委员会、工业部的代表及轻工业比较发达的重点省、市工业厅、工商局的代表等。在会议中，政务院财政经济委员会薄一波、李富春两位副主任曾作了指示。
    在闭幕会上，全体代表为了感谢毛主席的正确领导和人民志愿军的英勇作战，特电致敬。
