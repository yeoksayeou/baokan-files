　　*People's Daily* Commentary on the Closing of the Festival
    Youth of All Countries Unite in Friendship, Determined to Safeguard World Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th] TASS, Moscow: The *People's Daily* published an editorial on the 20th entitled "The Unity and Friendship of Young Peace Fighters," commenting on the closing of the Third World Youth and Student Festival. The editorial said that the movement of the people to consolidate a lasting and enduring peace has developed into a powerful force. The movement against the danger of another world war prepared by the US-British imperialist bloc is attracting more and more people from broader strata and more fighters to its ranks every day. The Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival is a vivid demonstration of the increasingly strong unity of peace fighters. The world's youth has shown all mankind their will to fight against the imperialist warmongers and their determination to do their best to defend peace. This festival has once again shown that police persecution, reactionary oppression, and the conspiracies of the imperialist right-wing socialist lackeys cannot break the courage and perseverance of the peace fighters, nor can they shake the determination of peace-loving people of all countries to safeguard peace. The youth participating in the festival, representing all democratic youth, declared to the world: the younger generation is determined to safeguard peace, and the younger generation is unwilling to be cannon fodder to carry out the adventurous plans of the US-British ambitious men who attempt to dominate the world.
    The editorial quoted the oath unanimously adopted by the youth representatives, pointing out that the fiery words of this oath not only expressed the indomitable will of young men and women to strive for peace, but also expressed the indomitable will of ordinary people all over the world to strive for peace. The broad masses of the people have fully realized that in order to avoid the danger of another world war, all good people must take active and resolute action. The great significance of the World Youth Festival lies first of all in the fact that it once again vividly demonstrates the growing unity and genuine friendship of young peace fighters. The idea of fighting for peace united all the youth representatives from various countries participating in the festival into one family.
    The editorial emphasized that the duty of peace fighters is to do their best to spread the propaganda of lasting peace and friendship among nations, to oppose the propaganda of hatred of mankind by the imperialist warmongers. Now, it is of utmost importance to expand the propaganda movement for safeguarding peace in order to expose the criminal conspiracies of the warmongers. The Soviet Union's consistent struggle for peace, freedom, and the independence of all nations is receiving increasing support from peace-loving people in all countries. The young peace fighters' realization of their oath of allegiance to peace, which they passed during the Berlin Festival, is their great contribution to strengthening world peace and international friendship.

　　真理报评联欢节闭幕
    各国青年团结友好  决心维护世界和平
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十日真理报发表题为《青年和平斗士们的团结和友好》的社论，评论第三届世界青年与学生联欢节闭幕。社论说。人民群众争取巩固而持久的和平的运动，已经发展成强大的力量。反对美英帝国主义集团所准备的再一次世界大战的危险的运动，一天天吸引了更广大阶层的人民和更多的战士到自己队伍里来。第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节是和平斗士们的力量愈益坚强的团结的生动的表现。世界青年向全人类表明了他们为反对帝国主义战争贩子们而斗争的意志和尽力保卫和平的决心。这一届联欢节再一次表明：警察的迫害、反动派的压迫、帝国主义的右翼社会党奴才们的阴谋，都不能击破和平斗士们的勇气和坚毅精神，也不能动摇爱好和平的各国人民维护和平的决心。参加联欢节的青年代表所有民主青年向全世界宣告：青年一代决心维护和平，青年一代决不愿当炮灰，去执行妄图称霸世界的美英野心家的冒险计划。
    社论引述青年代表一致通过的誓词，指出这一誓词的烈火一般的词句不仅表达了青年男女争取和平的不屈不挠的意志，而且表达了全世界普通人民争取和平的不屈不挠的意志。广大的人民群众都已充分认识到，为了避免另一次世界大战的危险，全体善良人民必须采取积极而坚决的行动。世界青年联欢节的重大意义首先在于：它再度生动地表明了青年和平斗士们日益增长的团结和真正的友好。为和平而斗争的思想把所有参加联欢节的各国青年代表团结成了一家人。
    社论强调说：和平斗士们的职责是要尽力展开关于国际间持久和平和友好的宣传，来反对帝国主义战争贩子们仇恨人类的宣传。现在，扩大维护和平的宣传运动以揭露战争贩子们的罪恶阴谋，是绝顶重要的。苏联为争取和平、自由与各民族的独立而进行的始终不渝的斗争，日益得到爱好和平的各国人民愈来愈大的支持。青年和平斗士们实现他们在柏林联欢节期间所通过的忠于和平的誓词，就是他们对加强世界和平和国际友好的重大的贡献。
