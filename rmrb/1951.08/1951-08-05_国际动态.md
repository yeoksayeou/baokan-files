    New Tricks of the Marshall Plan
    The "Marshall Plan Administration" recently announced that American "aid" will be given directly to enterprises in Marshallized countries, without going through their governments. The purpose of this decision by American imperialism is to further increase the dependence of the economies of Western European countries on American imperialists, eliminate enterprises that can compete with it, and obtain a market for dumping its goods; at the same time, it will make the production of various countries conform to the American policy of war preparations. In this way, the so-called "Marshallized countries" have become completely synonymous with "American colonies."
            Oppose American Rule in France
    The French reactionary government has basely supplied several French air force bases, including the air force base in Martinry near Chateauroux, for American use. The French pilots who served at Martinry Airport held a protest demonstration when they left Chateauroux, opposing American rule in France. The demonstrators shouted slogans: "Americans go home!" "We are being expelled now, but we will come back."
    American aggression against France and the French reactionary government's treasonous crimes have aroused deep anger among the French people. The French people who love their country will surely be able to drive out the American occupiers.

    马歇尔计划的新花样
    “马歇尔计划总署”最近宣布：美国的“援助”将直接给马歇尔化国家的企业，而不经过它们的政府。美国帝国主义这个决定的目的，在于进一步增加西欧国家经济对美帝国主义者的从属性，消灭能够和它竞争的企业，为它自己取得倾销货物的市场；同时使各国生产符合美国的备战政策。这样一来，所谓“马歇尔化国家”已彻头彻尾是“美国殖民地”的代名词了。
            反对美国统治法国
    法国反动政府卑鄙地将沙托卢附近马丁里地方的空军基地包括在内的法国若干空军基地供给美国使用。在马丁里飞机场服务的法国飞行员们，离别沙托卢时曾举行抗议性的示威，反对美国统治法国。示威者高呼口号：“美国人滚回美国去！”“我们现在被逐出，但是我们还要回来。”
    美国对法国的侵略和法国反动政府的卖国罪行，已激起了法国人民深刻的愤怒。热爱自己祖国的法国人民是一定能够把美国占领者驱逐出去的。
