The Telecommunications Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Reviews Its Mistake in Recruiting Employed Personnel

Comrade Editor:

Regarding the criticism from the Xi'an Mining Bureau regarding our bureau's personnel section "not to solicit cadres through personal connections," published in the Readers' Letters column of the People's Daily on June 24th, our bureau's personnel section has made the following self-criticism:

“(1) Circumstances: Our bureau published recruitment advertisements in March, and many employed personnel applied at that time, including Yang Shiheng (previously mistakenly written as Yang Shiheng in this newspaper). We considered that we should not employ already employed personnel, so we wrote to Yang Shiheng explaining that we could not employ him. Later, Yang wrote back, saying that the original organization had allowed him to leave his position, requesting that we consider his application. Soon after he wrote again to inquire. On April 16th, we replied, raising three questions (namely, the nature of the work, location, and salary), and asked him to obtain proof to come to Beijing. Yang Shiheng reported to Beijing in mid-May, but he did not have a departure certificate from the Xi'an Mining Bureau. He said that he needed a few days to obtain it due to procedures and time constraints, so we wrote to the Xi'an Mining Bureau to inquire about the process. At the same time, because the exchange of letters would take time, we gave him a trial period. It wasn't until the newspaper forwarded the criticism from the Xi'an Mining Bureau in early June that we learned that Yang Shiheng's claim that the original organization allowed him to leave his position was false.

(2) Our self-criticism: From the process of employing Yang Shiheng, it is clear that we made a mistake. According to correct organizational principles, when Yang Shiheng wrote to say that he had obtained the consent of his original organization to leave, we should have contacted the Xi'an Mining Bureau first to ascertain the truth. We should not have directly raised questions with Yang Shiheng without going through the organization, which greatly increased the difficulty of the Mining Bureau's cadre work. Secondly, when Yang Shiheng reported to Beijing, since he did not have a departure certificate, we should have immediately inquired with the Xi'an Mining Bureau before deciding whether to employ him or not. We should not have lightly believed his words, let alone given him a trial period for the sake of "saving time on exchanging letters" (although it was stated at the time that the trial period would be terminated at any time if there were no formal departure procedures). From the errors in the above handling, it shows that our overall concept is insufficient, and we did not deeply realize the consequences of employing already employed personnel. We did not follow correct organizational procedures, and we did not contact the original organization in advance, but instead made private contact with Yang Shiheng, disrupting work steps and increasing difficulties for the work of other units. In addition to accepting the lessons of this error and improving our future work, we request that the higher authorities give us the punishment we deserve.”

Our bureau's usual inspection and education of the personnel section were insufficient, and we did not help them grasp the correct principles in this recruitment work, which shows that we need to strengthen inspection and improve the policy and ideological level of our cadres in our work. An administrative warning has been given to the personnel responsible for recruitment in our bureau. Yang Shiheng's trial period was terminated on June 15th.

Tsinghua University Has Corrected the Mistake of Individual Professors Privately Recruiting Graduates

Comrade Editor:

The People's Daily published a letter from students Li Zhi and others in the "Readers' Letters" column on July 4th, which made a serious criticism of the behavior of professors in individual departments of our school in introducing jobs for students. We believe this criticism is very good. This situation has been quickly corrected since the establishment of the Graduate Employment Allocation Committee on June 12th. The professors involved in this matter have all made written or oral self-criticisms; students who had previously accepted private employment have also declared their withdrawal, expressing their obedience to unified allocation. Now 100% of our school's graduates have obeyed the government's unified allocation.

Tsinghua University Graduate Employment Allocation Committee

Editor's Note: Tsinghua University had already taken note of the need to correct the behavior of individual professors in the school who were privately recruiting graduates before the publication of the letter of criticism in this newspaper, which is very good. When this newspaper published the letter of criticism, it did not check whether these situations had already been corrected, which was our oversight. We believe that the erroneous behavior of violating the government's unified allocation of university graduates is not an isolated case; although some of these erroneous behaviors have been corrected, they have already caused a negative impact. Therefore, it is still necessary to criticize this erroneous behavior. We hope that other organs and schools mentioned in the letter of criticism will also conduct self-examination on this matter, so that this situation will not happen again in the future.

　　对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    中央重工业部电信工业局检讨招用在职人员的错误编辑同志：
    人民日报六月二十四日读者来信栏刊登西安矿务局对本局人事科“不应通过私人关系拉拢干部”的批评，本局人事科已作如下检讨：
    “（一）经过情形：本局在三月间曾登报招考工作人员，当时就有不少在职人员前来报名，阳世垣（前次本报误为阳世恒）也是其中的一个。我们当时也考虑到不应录用在职人员，就写信给阳世垣，说明我们不能录用。后来阳又来信，说原组织已经允许其离职，要求我们考虑，不久并又来信催询。我们就在四月十六日复信给他，并提出三个问题（即工作性质，地点，和工资问题），并要他取得证明来京。五月中阳世垣来京报到，并没有西安矿务局的离职证件，他说因手续及时间关系须过几天才可取得，我们就写信给西安矿务局询问经过，同时因信件往返费时，就先予试用，直到报社六月初转来西安矿务局的批评后，才知道阳世垣所说原组织允许其离职的事是假的。
    （二）我们的检讨：从录用阳世垣的经过看，我们显然是有错误的。按照正确的组织原则，当阳世垣来信说已得原组织同意离职时，就应该先和西安矿务局取得联系，询明真相，不应不通过组织，直接和阳世垣提出问题，使矿务局对干部工作上增加很大的困难。其次，当阳世垣来京报到时，既未持有离职证件，就应该立刻向西安矿务局询问清楚，再决定录用与否，不应轻信他的话，更不应为了“信件往返费时”，就先予试用（虽然当时声明如无正式离职手续，随时停止试用）。从以上处理上的错误看，说明了我们整体观念不够，没有深刻地认识到录用在职人员所引起的后果；我们没有按照正确的组织手续办事，没有事先和原机关取得联系，就和阳世垣私人接洽，紊乱了工作步骤，给别的单位的工作增加了困难。我们除了接受此次错误的经验教训，改进今后的工作外，并请求上级给予应有的处分。”
    本局平时对人事科检查和教育不够，没有帮助他们在这次招考人员的工作中掌握正确的原则，说明我们在工作上需要加强检查，提高干部的政策思想水平。对本局人事科负责招考工作的人员，行政上已决定给以警告处分。对阳世垣已于六月十五日停止试用。

     清华大学已经纠正个别教授私自招聘毕业生的错误行为编辑同志：
    七月四日人民日报《读者来信》栏发表了立之等同学的来信，对我校个别系的教授们替同学介绍工作的行为提出了严正的批评。我们认为，这种批评是很好的。这种情形，在六月十二日我校协助毕业生工作分配委员会成立以后，就已经迅速地纠正了。与此事有关的教授都已作了书面或口头的自我批评；以前曾接受私自洽聘的同学也已声明撤销，表示服从统一分配。现在我校毕业生已经百分之百服从政府统一分配了。
                      清华大学协助毕业生工作分配委员会
    编者按：清华大学在本报发表批评信以前，已经注意纠正了该校个别教授私自洽聘毕业生的行为，这是很好的。本报在发表批评信时，没有查清楚这些情况是否已经纠正，这是我们的疏忽。我们认为：违反政府统筹分配高等学校毕业生的错误行为，并不是个别性的；这些错误行为有的虽已纠正，但已经造成了不好的影响。因此，对这种错误行为提出批评，还是必要的。希望批评信中指出的其他机关学校，对此也进行检讨，使这种情况今后不再发生。
