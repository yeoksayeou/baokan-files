　　A Happy Old Age
　　——A Visit to Five Elderly Military Dependents in Xinxiang City
　　Lei Sha
　　In Xinxiang City, Pingyuan Province, there are five military dependents over the age of sixty who are now living happily in the Production and Welfare Home.
　　Around noon before "August 1st" (Army Day), I visited them.
　　Stepping into the gate of the Welfare Home gives one a sense of tranquility. The courtyard is spacious, with elegant, white rooms on both sides. I thought that the elderly would like this kind of environment, and my idea was proven correct by the director's conversation. He said, "The elderly are very satisfied with this place."
　　Through the director's introduction, I got to know these five elderly people. At this time, they were sitting in the courtyard enjoying the cool air. Each person was wearing new blue cloth clothes and holding a fan. From their rosy, smiling faces, one could see the happiness of their lives. Grandpa Xu Quan, who is seventy years old, told me, "I'm enjoying my old age! There's really nothing to say about our lives." Indeed, their lives are very good. They have a rich variety of food for every meal. Three people share a room, and the new quilts and sheets are all supplied by the government.
　　Their spiritual lives are also pleasant. The Welfare Home has a recreation room with chess, picture books… Recently, a radio was added. Every time before meals or before going to bed at night, everyone sits in the courtyard listening to the radio. Grandma Wang said, "The radio is really good. With it, we can hear songs, operas, and news from all over the world every day. The good days we're living now are better than we ever dreamed of." She also told me, "The Welfare Home has built fifty new rooms outside the city, and we will be moving soon." As she spoke, she giggled, a genuine laugh from the bottom of her heart.
　　In addition, they have also established a system for life and study, reading the newspaper every other day, holding a life meeting every seven days, taking a bath every two weeks, and getting a haircut once a month.
　　Living in such an environment, new ideas are gradually growing in the elderly. Grandma Wang said, "The government takes such good care of us, I've become a member of the country too! Although I'm old, I can't just sit around and do nothing, and I want my children to work hard." Now they raise ducks, pigs, and sheep themselves. Before "August 1st," everyone wrote letters to their children. In his letter to his son, Grandpa Xu Quan said, "Now I am being raised by the country, and you have also become a son of the country. Although truce talks are currently underway in Korea, I hope you will not be complacent. I want you to forever defend peace and defend our good life."

　　幸福的晚年
    ——访新乡市的五位老年军属
    雷沙
    平原省新乡市有五位年过六十高龄的军属，现在生产教养院幸福地过着他们的晚年。
    “八一”前夕的一个中午，我去访问了他们。
    踏进教养院的大门，使人有一种幽静的感觉，宽阔的院落，两旁是洁白雅致的房间。我想，这种环境是老人所喜爱的，从院长的谈话中，证明我的想法没有错。他说：“老人对这个地方太满意了。”
    经院长的介绍，我认识了这五位老人。这时他们正坐在院中乘凉，每个人身着新蓝布衣，手拿扇子，从那红润微笑的脸上，可以看出他们生活的幸福。七十岁的许泉老大爷告诉我：“老了，倒享福啦！提起我们的生活来，真是没说的。”的确，他们的生活很好，每日三餐都有丰富的食品。三个人住一间房，新的被子和床单都是由政府供给的。
    他们在精神生活上也是愉快的。教养院设有娱乐室，里面有象棋、画报……。最近又添了收音机。每到吃饭或晚上睡觉前，大家便坐在院子里收听广播。王老大娘说：“收音机真好，有了它，每天能听到唱歌，唱戏和各地的消息，现在过的真是作梦也没想到的好日子。”她还告诉我：“教养院在城外盖了五十间新房，不久我们就要搬家了。”说着，她咯咯地笑了起来，这是心底的真实的笑。
    另外，他们还建立了生活、学习制度，隔一天读一次报，七天开一次生活会，两星期洗一次澡，一月理一次发。
    生活在这样环境里的老人，新的思想在逐渐成长。王大娘说：“政府照顾得太好了，俺也成了国家的人啦！虽然老了也不能清吃坐穿，更要叫自己的孩子好好干。”现在他们自己喂养鸭子、猪、羊。“八一”前每个人都给自己的孩子写了信。许泉老大爷在给他儿子的信中说：“现在我由国家养着，你也成为国家的儿子了。现在朝鲜虽正在进行停战谈判，希望你不要麻痹。我要你永远保卫和平，保卫我们的好日子。”
