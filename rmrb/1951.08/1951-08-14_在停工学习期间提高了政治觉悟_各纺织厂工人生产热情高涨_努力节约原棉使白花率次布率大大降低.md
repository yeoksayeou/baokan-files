Workers in various cotton textile factories, which had temporarily suspended work due to a shortage of raw cotton, have successively resumed work. During the work stoppage, hundreds of thousands of textile workers engaged in political and technical studies; now, they have投入 themselves into production with even greater enthusiasm. They are determined to make the greatest efforts to ensure the conservation of raw materials and reduce costs in order to supply the clothing needs of the military and civilians nationwide with cotton yarn and cloth.

	Rich Gains During the Study Period
	Cotton textile factories in various locations organized workers to study during the work stoppage.

	The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, during this period of work stoppage and production reduction for textile workers, organized a lecturer group of seventy key responsible cadres at the municipal level, headed by Comrade Huang Jing, to go to the six cotton textile factories under the North China Textile Administration Bureau and the three private yarn factories, Hengyuan, Beiyang, and Dasheng, to conduct a month of political education for 16,000 workers. After this political study, the vast majority of textile workers gained a relatively systematic basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, understood what class and class struggle are all about, knew the relationship between the Communist Party and the working class, and recognized the happy communist future. The workers understood that the working class is glorious and that their daily labor has great significance, so they consciously stepped up their study of culture and technology, intensified production, and demanded frequent political study. Some workers who were previously considered backward transformed greatly during the study. For example, Zhao Wenlan, a female worker at the Hengyuan Yarn Factory, was not active in production in the past, slacking off and sleeping, thinking, "Now that the workers are masters, shouldn't they be allowed to sleep?" No one could persuade her. After this study, she became aware and voluntarily went to the trade union to say, "I am ashamed. It was as if I didn't exist in the workers' ranks in the past. From now on, I will definitely produce well!" She donated three months of production bonuses to purchase airplanes and cannons and also participated in an after-work school. Female workers with children at the state-owned Tianjin Fourth Cotton Textile Factory said, "Before the study, I thought I would just live one day at a time; now I know that we mothers have hope, and our children will be even happier in the future." "Now I understand the reason for production. From now on, we must change the way the Fourth Factory works!" Elderly technical workers also eliminated conservative ideas. For example, the master craftsmen in the Gao Xiurong and Dong Yanbin groups at the Hengyuan Yarn Factory said, "In the past, we only knew that we were working, and we would put in one point of effort for every penny we were paid; now we know that our production is for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and building the country, and also for improving our lives. To reach socialism quickly, we guarantee to teach one or two loom operators to repair machines within six months." According to statistics from the state-owned Tianjin Fourth Cotton Textile Factory, after the study, those who were relatively backward in production and politics and transformed into active participants accounted for 33.82 percent of the total number of people who studied. In general, after this political study, the class consciousness of the textile workers was raised, laying the foundation for future production work, trade union work, and regular political education work.

	In Shanghai, 120,000 workers participated in the study. Under the unified leadership of the "Work Stoppage Study Committee" jointly organized by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and other units, the workers used methods such as recollection, comparison, and denunciation, combined with the work of registering labor insurance cards, to conduct their studies. After studying, many workers realized that the suffering they had endured in the past was inflicted by imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and feudal forces. Therefore, they pledged to step up production, fulfill their donation plans, and strengthen the effort to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Female loom operators at the state-owned Shanghai Eighth Cotton Textile Factory who used to operate eight to sixteen looms now demanded to operate twenty to twenty-four looms. Some female workers who could originally weave forty-nine yards of cloth now confidently said, "We will weave more than fifty yards of cloth every day, and donate the extra wages to buy airplanes and cannons!" Mechanics who were responsible for repairing eighty-four machines in the past now said with confidence, "We guarantee that one person will be responsible for one hundred and sixty-eight machines!"

	The state-owned Shijiazhuang Textile Company and the private Dazheng Textile Factory in Shijiazhuang City basically completed their study plans by the time they resumed work. After studying the history of the Party, the employees of the Shijiazhuang Textile Company further recognized the glory and greatness of the Communist Party of China. The employees became closer to the Communist Party and strengthened the close unity of all employees. The Shijiazhuang Textile Company also focused on organizing technical studies, using practical teaching methods of disassembling and assembling machines, to help workers understand the machine structure and principles and improve the technical level of new workers, in light of the large number of new workers. Workers in Wuhan, Xi'an, Qingdao, and other places participated in political, cultural, and technical studies in conjunction with the registration of labor insurance cards and the democratic reform movement. After this study, the political awareness of the employees was generally raised a step further.

	During the work stoppage, maintenance workers in each factory completed the machine maintenance plan ahead of schedule. Machines in Shanghai factories, which had not been thoroughly overhauled for more than ten years, all underwent an unprecedented major turnaround during this work stoppage period. More than 90% of the factories completed the maintenance plan before resuming work, and working hours were generally shortened. The maintenance workers in the roving frame, wire, and coarse yarn workshops of the state-owned Shanghai Eighth Cotton Textile Factory completed the maintenance project nine days ahead of schedule. The combing maintenance work of the third spinning department of the state-owned Shanghai Seventeenth Cotton Textile Factory was also completed half a month ahead of schedule. In addition, the workers in the cleaning room of the private Qixin Yarn Factory also completed the maintenance task of 324 workdays in 216 workdays.

	A New Atmosphere After Resuming Work

	Now, yarn factories in various locations have successively resumed work. Workers' enthusiasm for production has increased a step further than in the past. Textile workers in Shanghai, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and other places have successively concluded workshop contact contracts or patriotic competition covenants, preparing to further improve production. Textile workers in various places have expressed their gratitude to their farmer brothers for their support, and are determined to conserve raw materials, reduce costs, and produce strong and durable yarn and cloth to repay the help of their farmer brothers. On the first day after resuming work, the white cotton waste at the private Yong'an No. 1 Factory dropped from 200-300 pounds per day to more than 60 pounds. The return waste in the wire workshop of Shenxin No. 6 Factory used to be more than 1,600 pounds per shift, but now it has also dropped to more than 200 pounds per shift. The second-class cloth rate of the state-owned Shanghai Tenth Cotton Textile Factory also dropped from 12.3% before the work stoppage to 3.18% after resuming work. The coarse yarn ends at the private Yong'an Yarn Factory used to be more than 200 pounds per day, but now they are only 50 pounds; in the past, coarse yarn tubes were replaced when there were still twenty or thirty coils of ends, but now they are replaced only when the yarn is completely used.

	After resuming work, the workers of the state-owned cotton factories and the private Hengyuan, Beiyang, and Dasheng yarn factories in Tianjin City have launched a new patriotic production upsurge. When the workers of the Beiyang Yarn Factory heard that work would resume on the 27th, everyone automatically requested to enter the factory on the 26th to happily sweep the floor and inspect the machines, and quickly started all the machines on the 27th. The operating workers in the third weaving workshop of the state-owned Tianjin First Cotton Textile Factory have successively requested to increase the number of looms they watch over. Some workers who could originally watch over sixteen looms can now watch over twenty looms. The work plans of the North China Textile Administration Bureau and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union for August and September both require that each factory widely promote new working methods to improve quality and establish and consolidate the production responsibility system. After resuming work, each factory has made great achievements in promoting new working methods. Sun Guilan of the state-owned Tianjin Second Cotton Textile Factory learned and applied the Kovalev working method, and learned from the nearby workshop the experience of using a mirror to check for hairy yarn ends and that the card head should not exceed two inches. She also found out the experience of Fu Huazhen in splicing quickly, Zhang Guizhen in hanging circles quickly, Sun Guilan in winding ends quickly, and Tian Xiulan in starting ends quickly within her team. After mutual learning, the return waste and defective yarn were greatly reduced, and the cleaning work method has made new progress. In the fine yarn workshop of the private Beiyang Yarn Factory, with the driving force of the Han Shumin team, the one-wrap starting method was widely promoted within a week, and the experience of using a mirror to check for hairy ends of the state-owned Tianjin Second Cotton Textile Factory was widely learned. In the past, each team would produce an average of twenty or thirty hairy ends a day. After promoting the experience of checking for hairy ends with a mirror, each team produces an average of only two or three, and some teams do not produce any hairy ends at all. At the same time, some backward teams and workers have also undergone significant changes after studying. For example, the Wei Suzhen team in the preparation room of the Hengyuan Yarn Factory did not produce well in the past. After resuming work this time, in order to reduce the amount of return waste from sizing, they took the initiative to solicit opinions from sizing workers and correct their shortcomings, and became active in production. Yu Shuzhen, a loom operator in the cloth workshop, used to watch only two looms and sometimes only wove eight yards of cloth on the night shift. After resuming work this time, she switched to watching six looms and wove more yards of cloth than before.

	After resuming work, all the workers of the Xi'an Dahua Yarn Factory signed a patriotic competition covenant and worked hard to save cotton. In the past, cotton that was pulled in by the cartload was thrown around on the ground, but now they are especially careful to pick it up. The small yarn ends in the reeling room are reeled cleanly, and no weft yarn is left in the cloth factory. The roller waste and oil waste in the fine yarn room have also been reduced. Therefore, the amount of cotton used per piece of yarn at the factory has now been reduced from 448 catties to about 420 catties.

	In addition, all the workers of the Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory, all the workers of the Xi'an Dahua Yarn Factory, the model worker Luo Shufang of the Jinan Renfeng Yarn Factory, Zhao Yuying of the Chengda Yarn Factory, and the female worker Wang Qinxian of the Kaifeng Tiantong Yarn Factory in Henan, and others wrote letters to their farmer brothers, guaranteeing to reduce waste, save labor, reduce the cost of cloth, and supply farmer brothers to improve their lives. They also hoped that their farmer brothers would demonstrate the spirit of hard struggle and support for the front line that they had shown in the past during the Liberation War, vigorously produce and plant more cotton, so that factories could operate regularly, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, develop production, and jointly build our new country.

　　在停工学习期间提高了政治觉悟
    各纺织厂工人生产热情高涨
    努力节约原棉使白花率次布率大大降低
    各地因原棉缺乏而暂时停工的棉纺织工厂已先后复工。数十万纺织工人，在停工期间进行了政治和技术学习；现在，他们已以更高的生产热情投入生产。他们决心以最大的努力，保证节约原料，降低成本，以棉纱棉布供应全国军民衣着的需要。
            学习期间的丰富收获
    各地棉纺织厂停工期间，都组织工人进行了学习。
    中国共产党天津市委员会在这次纺织工人停工减产期间，组织了以黄敬同志为首的市级主要负责干部七十人的讲师团，分头到华北纺织管理局所属六个棉纺织厂及私营恒源、北洋、达生三纱厂，向一万六千工人进行了一个月的政治教育。绝大多数纺织工人经过这次政治学习，得到了马克思列宁主义的较为系统的基本知识，懂得了阶级和阶级斗争是怎么一回事，知道了共产党和工人阶级的关系，认识了幸福的共产主义前途。工人们明白了工人阶级是光荣的，每天的劳动是有伟大意义的，就自觉地加紧学习文化、技术，加紧生产，并要求经常学习政治。有些过去被认为是落后的工人，在学习中转变了，进步很大。如恒源纱厂女工赵文兰过去生产不积极，偷懒睡觉，认为：“工人当了主人还不让睡觉吗？”谁劝她也不行。经过这次学习，她觉悟了，自动到工会去说：“我惭愧，过去工人队伍里就像没有我这个人，今后我一定好好生产！”她捐献了三个月的生产奖金购买飞机大炮，还参加了业余学校。国营天津第四棉纺织厂有小孩的女工说：“没学习以前，认为活一天混一天；现在知道作妈妈的有了指望，孩子将来更幸福了。”“现在我才明白了生产的道理，今后非让我们四厂工作变了样不可！”老年的技术工人，也消除了保守思想；如恒源纱厂高秀蓉、董妍斌小组的老师傅们说：“过去我们只知道自己是干活的，多给一分钱多出一分力；现在知道我们生产是为了抗美援朝建设国家，也是为了改善生活。为了赶快走到社会主义，我们向车间保证六个月教会一两个挡车工修机。”据国营天津第四棉纺织厂统计，经过学习，原来在生产上和政治上比较落后而转变为积极的，占全厂学习人数的百分之三三·八二。总起来说，经过这次政治学习，纺织工人的阶级觉悟提高了，为今后生产工作、工会工作及经常的政治教育工作打下了基础。
    上海有十二万工人参加学习。工人们在该市总工会等单位联合组织的“停工学习委员会”统一领导下，曾用回忆、对比、控诉等方式，结合劳动保险卡片登记工作进行了学习。不少工人经过学习后都认识了自己过去所受的痛苦是帝国主义、国民党反动派和封建势力给的，因此保证加紧生产，完成捐献计划，加强抗美援朝力量。国营上海第八棉纺织厂的挡车女工们过去挡八部到十六部车子的现在都要求挡二十部到二十四部。有的女工原来能织布四十九码，现在她们有信心的说：“每天织布超过五十码，超过的工钱捐献飞机大炮！”担任修理的机匠过去每人只能负责八十四台，现在拍着胸说：“保证一个人负责一百六十八台！”
    石家庄市国营石家庄纺织公司和私营大兴纺织厂到复工时基本上完成了学习计划。石家庄纺织公司职工经过学习党史，进一步认识了中国共产党的光荣和伟大，职工们更靠近了共产党，更加强了全体职工的亲密团结。石家庄纺织公司并根据新工人多的情况，着重组织了技术学习，用拆装机器的实际教学方法，使工人们了解了机器构造原理，提高了新工人的技术水平。武汉、西安、青岛等地工人都结合劳动保险卡片的登记和民主改革运动，参加了政治、文化、技术等方面的学习。经过这次学习，职工们政治觉悟普遍提高了一步。
    各厂停工期间，保全工人都提前完成了机器的检修计划。十余年来都未曾彻底进行检修的上海各厂机器都在此次停工期间全部空前大翻身，百分之九十以上的工厂都在复工前夕完成了检修计划，并普遍缩短了工时。国营上海第八棉纺织厂的清花、钢丝、粗纱等车间保全工人都提前九天完成了检修工程。国营上海第十七棉纺织厂第三纺部的梳棉保全工作亦提前半月完成了任务。此外私营启新纱厂清花间的工人们也以二百一十六个工的时间完成了三百二十四个工的检修任务。
            复工以后的崭新气象
    现在，各地纱厂均已先后复工。工人生产积极性比过去又提高了一步。上海、天津、石家庄等地纺织工人们纷纷订立了车间联系合同或爱国竞赛公约，准备进一步来把生产搞好。各地纺织工人纷纷表示感谢农民兄弟对他们的支援，决心以节约原料和减低成本，生产结实耐用的纱和布，来回答农民兄弟的帮助。上海私营永安一厂复工后的第一天白花衣即由以前的每天二、三百磅降到六十多磅。申新六厂钢丝间过去每班出回花达一千六百多磅，现在每班回花也都降到了二百多磅。国营上海第十棉纺织厂的次布率也由停工前的百分之十二点三降低到复工后的百分之三点一八。私营永安纱厂过去粗纱头每天有二百多磅，现在只有五十磅；过去粗纱筒管上还有二三十圈头时，就换掉了，现在做得光光的才换好纱。
    天津市国营棉纺各厂及私营恒源、北洋、达生三纱厂的工人，在复工以后，掀起了新的爱国主义生产热潮。北洋纱厂工人听说二十七日开工，大家就自动要求二十六日进厂，愉快地扫地、检查机器，二十七日就很快地将车全部开齐。国营天津第一棉纺织厂第三织布场运转工人，纷纷要求增加看车的台数，有的工人原来能看十六台织布机，现在能看二十台了。八、九月份华北纺织管理局及中国纺织工会天津市委员会的工作计划，都是要求各厂广泛推行新工作法，以提高质量，建立和巩固生产责任制。开工后，各厂在推行新工作法上，已经有了很大成绩。国营天津第二棉纺织厂孙桂兰，学习了郭瓦廖夫工作法，加以应用，从旁的车间学会了用镜子照毛脚纱、卡头不超过二英寸等经验；并在本组内，找出傅华珍接头快，张桂珍挂圈快，孙桂兰绕头快，田秀兰生头快的经验，经过互相学习，使回花、坏纱大为减少，清洁工作法有了新的进展。私营北洋纱厂细纱间，通过韩淑敏小组的带动，在一个星期以内，普遍推行了一绕生头法，并普遍学会了国营天津第二棉纺织厂用镜子照毛脚的经验。过去每组一天平均要出二、三十个毛脚纱，推广照毛脚纱的经验以后，每组平均一天只出两、三个，有些组一个毛脚纱也没有。同时，有些过去落后的小组和工友，经过学习，也有显著的转变。如恒源纱厂准备间魏素珍小组过去不好好生产，这次开工以后，为使浆纱少出回丝，主动向浆纱工人征求意见，改正缺点，生产上积极起来。布场挡车工于淑珍，过去只看两台车，有时夜班只织八码布；这次开工后改看六台车，织的码数比以前还多。
    西安大华纱厂复工后全厂工人们都订了爱国竞赛公约，努力节省用棉。以前一车一车拉进来的棉花满地乱扔，现在都特别小心地把它拾起来。摇纱间的小纱脚摇的干干净净，布厂的纬纱也都一点不留，细纱间的皮辊花、油花也减少了，因此，现在该厂每件纱的用棉量已由四百四十八斤降低到了四百二十斤左右。
    此外，石家庄大兴纱厂全体工人、西安大华纱厂全体工人、济南仁丰纱厂劳动模范骆淑芳、成大纱厂赵玉英、河南开封天同纱厂女工王琴仙等。纷纷写信给农民兄弟，除保证减少浪费，节约人工，使布的成本减低，供给农民兄弟改善他们生活外，并希望农民兄弟也拿出过去解放战争中艰苦奋斗支援前线的精神，大力生产，多种棉花，使工厂能经常开工，巩固工农联盟，发展生产，共同建设我们的新国家。
