　　Since the Xinhua Bookstore at all levels nationwide launched the campaign to collect books and periodicals for the Chinese People's Volunteers in February this year, it has achieved great success. As of August 17th, the number of books and periodicals donated by people across the country has exceeded 5.5 million. These books and periodicals have been successively transported to the Korean front, where they have been warmly welcomed by our volunteer soldiers, playing a significant role in boosting their morale and improving their cultural level. Most Xinhua Bookstore branches at all levels have attached importance to this work and have been able to promote the book collection campaign with great enthusiasm. For example, the East China region has collected more than 2.3 million books and periodicals, including more than 300,000 books and periodicals collected in Nanjing alone, and mobilized the masses to subscribe to more than 40,000 periodicals. In addition to collecting more than 1 million books and periodicals, the Northeast region also undertook the arduous task of reviewing books and periodicals from various places and summarizing and transferring them. The Beijing branch of Xinhua Bookstore alone collected more than 360,000 books and periodicals. However, there are also individual areas that have not carried out this work very well, and individual Xinhua Bookstores do not pay enough attention to it. For example, the Hebei branch only collected more than 1,000 books and periodicals, and the Pingyuan branch only collected more than 100 books and periodicals. In order to further carry out the work of collecting books and periodicals for the volunteer army, the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore headquarters issued a notice to the national branches on August 17th as follows:
　　(1) The period from September 1st to the end of December will be the time for the second phase of the book collection campaign. (2) Each branch must maintain close contact with the local party and government leading organs and the Resist America and Aid Korea sub-committees, and jointly study specific methods for organizing and mobilizing the masses, so as to widely carry out the campaign. (3) Strengthen publicity work. (4) In order to make the content of the collected books and periodicals suitable for the needs of the front-line soldiers, the general and sub-branches in various places should pay attention to recommending appropriate books and periodicals to people from all walks of life. (5) The books and periodicals collected by the branches in various places should first be sent to the superior branch, and then be submitted to the headquarters for review before being sent to the Northeast General Branch. (6) The books and periodicals collected in the first phase that have not yet been shipped must be quickly shipped to the Northeast General Branch for forwarding to the front.

　　新华书店的募集书刊运动获得很大成绩
    全国各级新华书店自今年二月发起为中国人民志愿军募集书刊运动以来，已获得很大成绩。截至八月十七日止，全国各地人民捐赠的书刊已在五百五十万册以上。这些书刊陆续运到朝鲜前线后，受到我志愿军战士们的热烈欢迎，对鼓舞他们的战斗情绪和提高他们的文化水平都起了很大的作用。新华书店各级店大部分重视了这一工作，都能以高度的热情推进募书运动。如华东区已募集了二百三十余万册书刊，其中南京一地即募到书刊三十余万册，并发动群众订赠期刊四万多份；东北区除募集了一百余万册书刊外，并担负了复查各地书刊和汇总转运的繁重任务；新华书店北京分店一处即募集书刊达三十六万余册。但也有个别地区还没有很好地开展这一工作，个别新华书店也不够重视。如河北分店只募集了一千多册书刊，平原分店只募集了一百多册书刊。北京新华书店总店为了进一步开展为志愿军募集书刊的工作，八月十七日向全国各级分店发出通知如下：
    （一）自九月一日起到十二月底止为第二期募书运动时间。（二）各级店必须与当地党政领导机关及抗美援朝分会密切联系，共同研究如何组织和发动群众的具体办法，以期运动能够广泛开展。（三）加强宣传工作。（四）为使募集书刊的内容适合前线战士的需要，各地总分店应注意向各界人民推荐适当的书刊。（五）各地支店募集的书刊先寄交上级分店，由分店汇交总店审查后再寄至东北总分店。（六）第一期募集的书刊尚未运出的，必须迅速运往东北总分店汇转前方。
