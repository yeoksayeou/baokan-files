Xinhua News Agency, London, 17th: According to TASS, London, 15th: The British "Daily Worker" sternly criticized the unreasonable demands made by the US side regarding the military demarcation line in the Korean armistice negotiations. The newspaper wrote: This is an absurd plan deliberately intended to sabotage the ceasefire negotiations, and it is a brazen denial of the entire spirit of the ceasefire negotiations.

　　In his suggestion in June, Malik proposed taking the 38th Parallel as the basis for a ceasefire; and everyone accepted this idea. Before the negotiations, Acheson said that the 38th Parallel was a reasonable demarcation line. Just a few days ago, the British Lord Chancellor Jowitt, representing the Labor government, declared that the 38th Parallel was clearly a truce demarcation line.

　　The newspaper then attacked the attitude of the US representatives, and pointed out: If this attitude is insisted upon, the result will inevitably be the continuation and expansion of the war.

　　The newspaper finally called on the British people to launch a massive mass movement to force the British government to publicly oppose the US demands and insist on a ceasefire on the 38th Parallel.

　　英《工人日报》评军事分界线问题
    号召人民坚持在三八线停火
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：英国《工人日报》严词斥责美方在朝鲜停战谈判中所提出的关于军事分界线的无理要求。该报写道：这是蓄意要破坏停火谈判的荒谬方案，这是对停火谈判的整个精神的厚颜无耻的否定。
    马立克在六月间的建议中，提议以三八线为停火的基础；并且大家都接受了这种意见。在谈判以前，艾奇逊说过，三八线是合理的分界线。仅仅在几天以前，英国司法大臣约维特还代表工党政府声明三八线是明明白白的一条休战分界线。
    该报继而抨击美方代表的态度，并指出：如果坚持这种态度，其结果必然是战争的继续和扩大。
    该报最后号召英国人民展开巨大的群众运动，迫使英国政府公开反对美国的要求，并坚持在三八线上停火。
