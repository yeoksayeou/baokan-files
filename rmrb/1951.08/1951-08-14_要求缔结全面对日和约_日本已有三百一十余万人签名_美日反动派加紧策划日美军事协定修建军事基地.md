　　Demanding the Conclusion of a Comprehensive Peace Treaty with Japan
    More Than Three Million One Hundred Thousand People in Japan Have Signed
    U.S.-Japan Reactionaries Intensify Planning of U.S.-Japan Military Agreement and Construction of Military Bases
    Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: TASS, August 12th: The Japanese newspaper "World Peace News" reported: By the end of July, 2,126,300 signatures had been collected in Japan for the World Peace Council's declaration demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with the five major powers. Among them, Tokyo had 900,000, Hyogo Prefecture had 216,399, Osaka Prefecture had 171,480, Fukuoka Prefecture had 154,787, and Kanagawa Prefecture had 130,825.
    According to "Peace Treaty News": As of July 25th, 3,157,850 people in Japan had signed a petition demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: TASS, August 11th: According to Tokyo sources, while the U.S. authorities are hurriedly accelerating a separate peace treaty with Japan, they are also intensifying activities to turn Japan into an American military bridgehead. Currently, the U.S. Command and Japanese authorities are actively preparing to conclude a U.S.-Japan military agreement, so that the agreement can be signed simultaneously with the separate peace treaty with Japan that the U.S. is planning.
    According to Tokyo democrats, U.S. Secretary of Defense Marshall and other U.S. military representatives who recently visited Japan paid special attention to the issue of signing a U.S.-Japan military agreement, especially the establishment of U.S. military bases. Another reason the U.S. occupation authorities are hastily establishing U.S. garrison camps on the Japanese islands is that they can now use Japanese occupation fees to carry out this project. The specific locations for implementing this plan have been designated in Hokkaido and northern Honshu, where the U.S. 45th and 40th Divisions are stationed. They will continue to be stationed there after the separate peace treaty. Large-scale projects are currently underway to expand the military bases and barracks in Makomanai and Chitose (both in Hokkaido). More than 10 billion yen has been allocated for these projects. Large quantities of U.S. military equipment, including tanks and aircraft, are being transported to Hokkaido.
    Large-scale military projects are also being constructed in Sendai, Hachinohe, and Kami-machi (northern Honshu), where the U.S. 40th Division is stationed. Old airports are being repaired, and new airports are being built. Among the most important are the airports in Chitose, Yakumo (both in Hokkaido), Misawa, Ichinoseki (both in northern Honshu), Tachikawa, Yokota, Johnson, Atsugi (all near Tokyo), Miho (Shimane Prefecture), and Itazuke (Fukuoka Prefecture). The large airport in the Fujisawa area of Kanagawa Prefecture has recently been repaired. Radio equipment has been installed in several locations in Hokkaido and northern Honshu.
    The naval bases, mainly Yokosuka and Sasebo, have largely completed their repair work. Sasebo Port is now the main supply base for the U.S. intervention army in Korea. The weapons and ammunition stored in the port have reached their maximum capacity and often have to be placed on school playgrounds. Anti-aircraft guns are erected on the hills surrounding Sasebo. The port is practically under martial law. The U.S. authorities brutally suppress even the slightest protest from the Japanese people.
    Moreover, the Americans have recently intensified the construction and repair of strategic highways and the expansion of the most important railway stations. All the expenses required for these military preparations weigh heavily on the shoulders of the Japanese people, forcing them to take money and turn their country into an American military base.

　　要求缔结全面对日和约
    日本已有三百一十余万人签名
    美日反动派加紧策划日美军事协定修建军事基地
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社十二日讯：日本《世界和平报》报道说：到七月底为止，在日本为世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言征集了二百十二万六千三百人的签名。其中，东京有九十万人，兵库县有二十一万六千三百九十九人，大阪府有十七万一千四百八十人，福冈县有十五万四千七百八十七人，神奈川县有十三万零八百二十五人。
    据《讲和新闻报》消息：到七月二十五日为止，在日本签名要求缔结全面对日和约的有三百十五万七千八百五十人。
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社十一日讯：据东京消息，美国当局一方面正在匆匆忙忙地加速单独对日媾和；同时，还在加紧活动，要把日本变成美国的军事桥头阵地。现在，美国司令部和日本当局正在积极准备缔结日美军事协定，以便该协定能与美国正在策划的单独对日和约同时签订。
    据东京民主人士指出：最近以前到过日本的美国国防部长马歇尔与美国其他军事代表们，他们特别注意签订日美军事协定的问题，尤其是建立美国军事基地的问题。美国占领当局正在日本岛屿上匆促地建立美国屯兵场的另一个原因是：他们现在可以利用日本占领费来进行这种工程。实行这个计划的具体地点已规定在北海道和本州的北部，那里驻扎着美军第四十五师和第四十师。在单独媾和后，他们仍将继续驻扎下去。现在正在进行大规模的工程，扩大真驹内和千岁两地（均在北海道）的军事基地和兵营。为了这些工程，已拨款一百亿日元以上。大批的美国军备，包括坦克和飞机在内，正在运往北海道。
    在仙台、八户和神町（本州北部）这些驻扎着美军第四十师的地方，也在建造着大规模的军事工程。旧机场在修复中，新机场在建筑中。其中最重要的是在千岁、八云（均在北海道），三泽、一关（均在本州北部），立川、横田、约翰逊、厚木（均在东京附近），三保（译音）（岛根县）和板付（福冈县）等地的机场。神奈川县藤泽（译音）地区的大机场最近已经修复了。北海道和本州北部有若干地点都装置了电台的设备。
    海军基地主要是横须贺和佐世保，它们的修复工程，许多已告完成。佐世保港现在是美国在朝鲜的干涉军的主要的供应基地，在该港储存的武器和军火已经达到最大的数量，甚至经常必须放在学校的操场里。在佐世保周围的山岗上架着高射炮。该港实际上已进入戒严状态。日本人民只要有一点抗议，美国当局就予以残酷的镇压。
    不仅如此，最近美国人还在加紧建筑并修复战略公路，扩大最重要的火车站等。这些军事准备工程所需要的一切费用，沉重地压在日本人民的肩上，迫使他们拿出钱来把他们的国家变成美国的军事基地。
