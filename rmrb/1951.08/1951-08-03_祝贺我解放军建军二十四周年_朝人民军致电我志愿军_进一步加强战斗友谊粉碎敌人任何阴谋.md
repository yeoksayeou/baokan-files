　　The entire officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army sent a telegram to all commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Volunteers on August 1st, warmly congratulating the "August 1st" Army Day. The telegram is as follows:

Comrade Commanders and Combatants of the Chinese People's Volunteers!

On the occasion of the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the true armed force of the Chinese people, we, the entire officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, extend our warm congratulations to all commanders and combatants of the heroic Chinese People’s Volunteers.

The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army is the first workers' and peasants' revolutionary armed forces in the long history of China. Under the correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and its leader Chairman Mao Zedong, it has grown and strengthened over the past twenty-four years in the arduous and fierce struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionary bandit gang and foreign invaders.

The Chinese people, with the powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army, overthrew the domestic reactionary rule and foreign invaders, and created a new, free, and powerful People's Republic of China, achieving the world-significant victory of the Chinese People's Revolution .

Today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is not only consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship at the domestic level, preventing foreign aggression, and protecting the Chinese people, but also has become a bastion of peace and security in Asia at the international level.

The glorious fighting experience of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army has strengthened the victorious confidence of the Korean people, who are engaged in fierce struggles with the American armed interventionists to defend the unification, independence, freedom, and honor of their motherland, and has further inspired our fighting spirit.

When the frenzied offensive of the American aggressors temporarily put the Korean people's fatherland liberation war in a difficult environment, and China's security was directly threatened, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people formed the Chinese People's Volunteers, holding high the banner of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Defending the Home, and Defending the Country," and enthusiastically came to the Korean battlefield, establishing heroic and great achievements and a glorious fighting record in the battle against the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese people -- the American aggressors and their lackeys.

The arrival of the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield immediately brought about tremendous changes in our country's military and political situation.

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in close coordination, launched a counter-offensive, inflicting annihilating blows on the enemy who had once invaded north of the Chongchon River, causing heavy losses to the enemy's manpower and combat equipment.

As a result, the enemy faced the fate of collapse on the entire front. The American aggressor army suffered a disastrous defeat unprecedented in its war history and was driven far away by us.

Today, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with our People's Army, are displaying unparalleled heroism and courageous dedication in the battle to eliminate the American imperialist aggressor army, smashing the American imperialists' aggressive plan to enslave our country, and laying the foundation for final victory.

We, the entire officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, will never forget the combat assistance given to us by the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers during our country's difficult times. Their heroic and great contributions and combat achievements in our country's liberation war will be forever recorded in our country's history.

Although the cunning and brutal American aggressors have suffered heavy blows and defeats in the Korean War, they have not yet learned the lessons they deserve. They have not abandoned their aggressive ambitions, and continue to oppose the withdrawal of foreign troops to ensure a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, openly attempting to station their armed intervention forces in Korea indefinitely.

But this will not work. The Korean People's Army will further strengthen the friendship and solidarity formed in blood in the struggle against the common enemy—the American imperialist armed interventionists—with the Chinese People's Volunteers, and will surely shatter any enemy conspiracy.

Finally, for the happiness of the Korean and Chinese people, and for the peace and security of Asia and the world, we wish you and all commanders and combatants of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army more glorious combat victories and new achievements!

The entire officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army
August 1, 1951

　　祝贺我解放军建军二十四周年
    朝人民军致电我志愿军
    进一步加强战斗友谊粉碎敌人任何阴谋
    【新华社平壤二日电】朝鲜人民军全体官兵于八月一日致电中国人民志愿军全体指挥员战斗员，热烈祝贺“八一”建军节。电文如下：中国人民志愿军全体指挥员战斗员同志们！
    值此中国人民的真正武装力量——英雄的中国人民解放军建军二十四周年之际，我们朝鲜人民军全体官兵，谨向英勇的中国人民志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员致以热烈的祝贺。
    英雄的中国人民解放军是在悠久的中国历史上头一次出现的工农革命军队。它是在伟大的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东主席的正确领导下，二十四年来在反对蒋介石国民党反动匪帮和外国侵略者的艰苦而激烈的斗争过程中成长壮大起来的。
    有强大的中国人民解放军的中国人民，打倒了国内反动统治和外国侵略者，创建了崭新的、自由的、强大的中华人民共和国，取得了中国人民革命的有世界意义的胜利。
    今天中国人民解放军不仅正在国内巩固着人民民主专政，防止着外国侵略，保卫着中国人民，而且在国际上它也已成为亚洲和平安全的堡垒。
    英雄的中国人民解放军的光荣斗争经验，加强了为保卫自己祖国的统一、独立、自由、荣誉而和美国武装干涉者展开着激烈斗争的朝鲜人民的胜利信心，更加鼓舞着我们的斗志。
    当美国侵略者的疯狂进攻使我们朝鲜人民的祖国解放战争暂时处于困难环境，而中国的安全直接受到威胁的时候，中国人民的优秀儿女，就组成了中国人民志愿军，高举着“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的旗帜，踊跃地来到朝鲜战场，在反抗朝、中两国人民的共同仇敌——美国侵略者及其走狗的战斗中，建立了英雄的伟大功勋和光辉的斗争业绩。
    兄弟般的中国人民志愿军来到朝鲜战场后，立刻使我国的军事、政治形势发生了巨大的转变。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在紧密的协同作战下，转入反攻，给予一度进犯到清川江以北的敌人以歼灭性的打击，使敌人的有生力量和战斗器材遭到重大损失。
    其结果，敌人在整个战线上面临溃败的命运，美国侵略军遭到其战争史上未曾有过的惨败，而被我们驱逐到很远的地方去了。
    今天，中国人民志愿军和我们人民军一起，在消灭美帝国主义侵略军的战斗中，发挥着无比的英雄主义和勇敢献身精神，粉碎了美帝国主义者妄图奴役我国的侵略计划，奠定了最后胜利的基础。
    我们朝鲜人民军全体官兵，永远不会忘记兄弟般的中国人民志愿军在我国严重的时期所给予我们的战斗帮助。他们在我国解放战争中建立的英雄的伟大功勋和战斗业绩，将永垂于我国的史册。
    狡猾而又残暴的美国侵略者，在朝鲜战争中虽然遭到沉重的打击和失败，但它还未取得应有的教训，依然没有放弃其侵略企图，且继续反对着撤退外国军队以保障和平解决朝鲜问题，而公开企图将其武装干涉军无限期地驻留在朝鲜。
    但这是不行的。朝鲜人民军将进一步加强和中国人民志愿军在反抗共同仇敌——美帝国主义武装干涉者的斗争中以鲜血结成的友谊团结，一定要粉碎敌人的任何阴谋。
    最后，为了朝、中两国人民的幸福，为了亚洲与全世界的和平安全，谨祝你们和英雄的中国人民解放军全体指挥员和战斗员取得更光辉的战斗胜利和新的成果！
      朝鲜人民军全体官兵
        一九五一年八月一日
