To the Editor:

We believe that the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau's attitude of not paying attention to and delaying the promotion of the advanced experiences of the Zhang Yichang team in the chemical industry system is very wrong.

The Zhang Yichang team of a state-owned chemical factory in Northeast China has maintained excellent production performance since the beginning of 1950. They have created many advanced experiences. Zhang Yichang has been elected as a labor model in Shenyang twice and has attended the Shenyang Labor Model Representative Conference twice.

Therefore, in March of this year, we (the Shenyang Chemical Industry Trade Union) discussed with the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau Party Committee and prepared to promote this advanced experience through the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau. Subsequently, four comrades from the National Chemical Industry Trade Union assisted in summarizing the experiences of the Zhang Yichang team in half a month. On April 10th, we, together with comrades from the Chemical Industry Bureau Party Committee, Wang Mengzhong, Minister of the Organization Department of the Northeast Chemical Industry Trade Union, reporters from the Shenyang Daily, and Zhang Zhen, Director of the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau, studied the results. Director Zhang believed that the spring safety inspection was underway at the time, and the promotion of advanced experiences should be carried out in the second half of the month.

On April 27th, we invited the factory director of the chemical factory, comrades from the Chemical Industry Bureau Party Committee, Liu Keming, Minister of the Production Department of the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, and others to study with the Chemical Industry Bureau on how to promote advanced experiences. Secretary-General Yang of the Chemical Industry Bureau participated in this meeting. During the discussion, the Chemical Industry Bureau raised the issue that they did not understand the situation of the Zhang Yichang team. Therefore, it was decided to further study and organize the experience of the Zhang Yichang team to make it more systematic and clear, and it was decided to convene a preparatory meeting on May 7th to study and deploy the promotion in May.

According to the meeting resolution, we further organized the experience of the Zhang Yichang team. A preparatory meeting was officially convened on May 7th, and it was decided to deploy the promotion. At that time, all parties attached great importance to this matter. In addition to the responsible comrades from the Party, government, and trade union of the chemical industry system, there were also Director Xu of the Shenyang Daily, Minister Liu Keming of the Production Department of the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, comrades from the Production Department of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, and reporters from the Northeast Daily and Radio Station. It was decided at the meeting that the promotion of the advanced experience of the Zhang Yichang team should be combined with the spring safety inspection. The Chemical Industry Bureau would convene a cadre meeting of about 250 people (with broad representation) on May 14th to mobilize. A promotion committee was established during the meeting, with Yang Zhen, Secretary-General of the Chemical Industry Bureau, as the director, and Gao Ping, Chairman of the Northeast Chemical Industry Trade Union, and Pan Keming, Chairman of the Shenyang Chemical Industry Trade Union, as deputy directors. The meeting also decided that the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau and the Northeast Chemical Industry Trade Union should notify the administrative departments of each chemical factory separately and call on all employees to learn from the advanced experience of the Zhang Yichang team.

After the meeting, the Shenyang Chemical Industry Trade Union immediately made arrangements at the Production and Wage Committee, and the trade union cadres of each factory began to learn from the advanced experience of the Zhang Yichang team. However, the Chemical Industry Bureau was slow to issue notices to the factories. We repeatedly inquired, but Secretary-General Yang of the Chemical Industry Bureau said, "This matter should be handled with caution, let's postpone it!"

It was not until June 1st that the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions instructed us on the promotion of the advanced experience of the Zhang Yichang team, saying that we should "conduct further research with the Northeast Chemical Industry Trade Union Committee and the Chemical Industry Bureau, and after reaching a consensus, we should promote it vigorously." According to this instruction, we contacted the Northeast Chemical Industry Trade Union and the Chemical Industry Bureau again. On June 5th, the second preparatory meeting was held in the Chemical Industry Bureau. Zhang Dingyi, Deputy Director of the Chemical Industry Bureau, and Yang Zhen, Secretary-General, also attended. At the meeting, it was once again determined to combine the quality inspection and promotion in Shenyang. The Chemical Industry Bureau would convene a cadre meeting of each factory in Shenyang to mobilize. At this time, the Chemical Industry Bureau raised the issue that they did not understand the situation of the Zhang Yichang team, and asked the factory director of the chemical factory, the Party Committee of the Chemical Industry Bureau, and the Chairman of the Shenyang Chemical Industry Trade Union to re-examine and stamp the materials to show responsibility, and then the Chemical Industry Bureau would send them to the Northeast Industrial Department for approval. After doing so, the Northeast Industrial Department approved the promotion on June 25th. However, the Chemical Industry Bureau was still passive and procrastinating on this matter. They were also slow to inform us of the approval from the Industrial Department.

On June 29th, we received a letter from Gao Ping, Chairman of the Northeast Chemical Industry Trade Union, regarding the promotion of the advanced experience of the Zhang Yichang team, saying that "the Chemical Industry Bureau has tentatively designated Jiang Yang to be responsible, and the Trade Union will be responsible by Sun Chao, and a decision will be made after further research." From March, we have been asking the administrative side to cooperate in promoting this experience, and by the end of June, it was still "a decision will be made after further research." At this point, the promotion committee was no longer effective, and the person in charge of this work in the bureau was pushed by the director to Secretary-General Yang Zhen, and Secretary-General Yang Zhen pushed it to a cadre who was not primarily responsible. We felt that this was outrageous, so we actively contacted the Northeast Chemical Industry Trade Union again. Chairman Gao Ping replied that after discussing with Secretary-General Yang Zhen of the Chemical Industry Bureau, it was decided to raise the issue of promoting the advanced experience of the Zhang Yichang team at the recent joint meeting of factory directors convened by the Chemical Industry Bureau, and asked us to prepare opinions and present them at the meeting. Although Comrade Gao Ping asked us to prepare opinions, the Chemical Industry Bureau believed that our association was a local trade union and could not participate in their meetings. Now the joint meeting of factory directors has ended, and the promotion of the advanced experience of the Zhang Yichang team is still not mentioned. We believe that the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau says it supports the trade union and agrees to promote the advanced experience of the Zhang Yichang team in words, but in reality, it does not pay attention to it and delays in dealing with it. We believe that it is very wrong for the Northeast Chemical Industry Bureau to treat the advanced experience of the workers with such an attitude.

### 东北工业部化学工业局  为何不积极推广先进经验？

    东北工业部化学工业局
    为何不积极推广先进经验？编辑同志：
    我们认为东北化学工业局对推广化工系统中张义昌小组的先进经验一直表现不重视和拖延应付的态度是非常错误的。
    国营东北某化工厂张义昌小组自一九五○年初以来，一直保持优异的生产成绩，他们曾创造了不少先进经验。张义昌曾两次当选为沈阳市的劳动模范，并两次出席沈阳市劳动模范代表会议。
    因此，在今年三月，我们（沈阳市化学工会）就和东北化学工业局党委讨论，准备通过东北化学工业局推广这一先进经验。此后并由全国化学工会的四位同志协助，用半个月的时间总结了张义昌小组的经验。我们在四月十日会同化学工业局党委的同志、东北化学工会组织部王孟忠部长、沈阳日报社记者等和东北化学工业局张珍局长研究结果，张局长认为当时正进行春季保安大检查，推广先进经验应放在下半月进行。
    到四月二十七日，我们又邀请了化工厂厂长、化学工业局党委的同志及沈阳市总工会生产部长刘克明同志等，和化学工业局研究如何进行推广先进经验的工作。化学工业局由杨秘书长参加这次会议，讨论中间，化学工业局又提出不了解张义昌小组的情况，因此又决定将张义昌小组的经验进一步研究整理，使其更加系统明确，并决定在五月七日召开筹备会研究布置，五月份一定推广。
    我们根据会议决议，进一步整理了张义昌小组的经验。五月七日正式召开了筹备会，决定布置推广。当时各方面对这事很重视，到会的除了化学工业系统的党、政、工负责同志外，还有沈阳日报社徐社长、沈阳市总工会生产部刘克明部长、东北总工会生产部的同志，及东北日报、广播电台的记者。会上决定推广张义昌小组先进经验和春季保安大检查结合进行，由化学工业局在五月十四日召开二百五十人左右的干部会（有广泛代表性的），进行动员；会中并成立了推广委员会，由化学工业局杨真秘书长任主任，东北化学工会主席高屏同志和沈阳市化学工会主席潘克明同志任副主任；会上还决定由东北化学工业局、东北化学工会分别通知各化学工厂行政方面，号召全体职工学习张义昌小组的先进经验。
    会后，沈阳市化学工会随即在生产工资委员会上作了布置，各厂工会干部即开始学习张义昌小组的先进经验。但是，在化学工业局方面，却迟迟不给各厂下通知，我们一再追问，化学工业局杨秘书长却说：“这件事要慎重一些，往后拖一拖吧！”
    直到六月一日，东北总工会对推广张义昌小组先进经验的事指示我们，要“与东北化学工会委员会和化学工业局作更进一步的研究，取得一致意见后，要大张旗鼓地推广。”根据这一指示，我们又与东北化学工会和化学工业局联系，六月五日，在化学工业局召开了第二次筹备会议。化学工业局张定一副局长、杨真秘书长也都参加了。会上再次确定结合质量大检查在沈阳市推广，由化学工业局召开沈阳各厂干部会，进行动员。而此时化学工业局又提出不了解张义昌小组的情况，要化学工厂厂长、化学工业局党委、沈阳市化学工会主席把材料重新审查、盖章以示负责，然后由化学工业局送东北工业部请求批准。这样作了之后，东北工业部在六月二十五日批准同意推广。但，化学工业局对这事还是消极、拖拉。对工业部批准的事也是迟迟不告诉我们。
    六月二十九日，我们接到东北化学工会高屏主席对推广张义昌小组先进经验的事，说“化学工业局暂定由江扬负责，本会由孙超负责，研究后再作决定”。从三月我们就要求行政方面配合推广这一经验，到六月末还是“研究后再作决定”。至此，推广委员会也不生效了，局里对这个工作的负责人由局长出面推到杨真秘书长身上，杨真秘书长又推到一个不负主要责任的干部身上。我们感到这太不像话了，就又积极和东北化学工会联系，高屏主席又复信说，他和化学工业局秘书长杨真商谈结果，决定在最近化学工业局召开的厂长联席会上提出来讨论推广，并要我们准备意见，在会上提出。高屏同志虽叫我们准备意见，但化学工业局认为我会系地方工会，不能参加他们这样的会议。现在厂长联席会已开完了，对推广张义昌小组先进经验的事仍然是一字未提。我们认为东北化学工业局对推广张义昌小组先进经验，口头说支持工会，同意推广，实际是不加重视，拖延应付。我们认为东北化学工业局用这样的态度来对待职工的先进经验是非常错误的。
