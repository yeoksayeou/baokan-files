Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 30th: On August 28th, the United Nations Command Headquarters Press Bureau issued an official document. In this document, the press bureau, while addressing the well-founded accusations made by General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai in their August 27th reply to General Ridgway regarding the United Nations forces' repeated violations of the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement, dared not publish the full text of the righteous reply from Generals Kim and Peng, so that the world could understand the full picture of their reply. On the other hand, the press bureau distorted facts, obscured the truth, and attempted to escape and shirk responsibility for the United Nations forces' repeated violations of the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement. This is an extremely unserious and irresponsible behavior. The spokesman for the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in order to clarify the truth of the matter to the world, hereby issues a statement refuting the aforementioned official document published by the United Nations Command Press Bureau. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　The United Nations Command Headquarters Press Bureau, in order to confuse the public and conceal the truth, deliberately exaggerated and distorted issues in its document released on August 28th, such as the matter of journalists visiting the conference site area and our military police mistakenly entering the conference site area during the Kaesong negotiations, as well as the issue of the United Nations delegation having only one person and the delegation's car being occasionally detained by our military police for a few minutes. In fact, these issues have already been reasonably resolved by our side with a serious and responsible attitude, the principle of equal treatment, and a position favorable to the armistice negotiations, and the United Nations side has already expressed satisfaction with these resolutions. While exaggerating and distorting these issues that are no longer problematic, the press bureau is doing everything in its power to fabricate rumors and slanders regarding the serious incidents of United Nations armed personnel illegally entering the neutral zone on August 19th, murdering our military police platoon leader Yao Qingxiang and seriously wounding soldier Wang Renyuan, as well as the bombing and strafing of our delegation's residence by United Nations aircraft on August 22nd, murdering members of our delegation, in an attempt to escape and deny the major responsibility they should bear.

　　Regarding the murder of Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang, our chief representative, General Nam Il, in his detailed report issued on August 28th, has already used irrefutable witness testimony and physical evidence to eloquently prove that this murder was an illegal act committed by troops belonging to the United Nations forces. Even United Nations liaison officer Lieutenant Colonel Murray, during the joint investigation by liaison officers from both sides, and General Joye, the chief representative of the United Nations delegation, in his reply to General Nam Il, the chief representative of our delegation, could not deny this fact. However, afterwards, the United Nations side not only did not accept our reasonable demand for severe punishment of the murderers and a thorough guarantee that no more violations of the neutral zone would occur, as proposed by our side regarding this incident of violating the Neutral Zone Agreement and murdering our military police who were performing their duties in accordance with the agreement, but instead published lies through its press bureau to shirk responsibility, claiming that the "Republic of Korea" troops who carried out the murder on that day, wearing uniforms, taking up arms, and entering the neutral zone, were not under the military command and control of the United Nations forces. Not only that, but the press bureau even said, devoid of conscience, that our military police did not resist, as if they deserved to die. However, the villagers at the scene of the incident clearly testified during the joint investigation that the armed personnel who murdered Yao Qingxiang had entered the neutral zone from outside the neutral zone, and after the murder, fled back to outside the neutral zone from the neutral zone. This proves that these armed personnel who wore uniforms, took up arms, and entered the neutral zone to murder Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang were armed personnel under the control of the United Nations forces. These armed personnel illegally sneaked into the neutral zone from the United Nations forces' area several kilometers away; if they had not had the cover and support of the United Nations forces, these armed personnel would have been eliminated long ago. The crux of the matter is not that our military police, who were only carrying police weapons, failed to eliminate them, but that the United Nations forces were protecting these armed personnel. And doesn't the United Nations forces' protection of these armed personnel prove that these armed personnel are part of the United Nations forces?

　　Regarding the United Nations military aircraft's air raid on the Kaesong Neutral Zone on the night of August 22nd, the United Nations Command Headquarters Press Bureau also attempted to deny in its official document that the military aircraft that dropped the bombs were United Nations military aircraft, and even falsely accused that this incident was manufactured by our personnel. In order to prove this slander, the press bureau did not hesitate to distort the facts and reverse right and wrong, insisting that our liaison officer had refused the United Nations liaison officer's request to come again during the daytime to investigate. However, coincidentally, the radar reconnaissance report of the United Nations forces' Fifth Air Force exactly proved that an unidentified aircraft had appeared west of Kaesong when the bombing and strafing occurred. And since this unidentified aircraft was unidentified, how could it be identified as our aircraft? Isn't this an admission of guilt?

　　To say that the bombing and strafing of our delegation's residence by this aircraft was done by our personnel is simply insane nonsense. First of all, it is impossible to imagine sacrificing one's own delegation for any purpose. We can assert that no one in the world, except for the conscienceless American generals, would dare to imagine such a thing. Secondly, judging from the specific circumstances of the United Nations military aircraft's bombing this time, the vast majority of the bombs dropped landed only one or two hundred meters from our delegation's residence. Anyone with a little knowledge of aerial bombing knows that it is almost impossible to control one's bombing so that it only lands two or three hundred meters from the target, but never hits the target. Therefore, unless the purpose is to murder one's own delegation members, it is impossible to imagine arranging a bombing in advance that only drops bombs so close to one's own delegation's residence, but not with the purpose of hitting it.

　　In fact, this kind of insane slander cannot deceive anyone. On the contrary, the more the United Nations side promotes this slander, the more it proves that this illegal and serious provocative act aimed at murdering our delegation was done by the United Nations forces themselves. The physical evidence preserved intact at the scene, and all the residents of Kaesong City as witnesses, prove that the military aircraft that carried out the murderous bombing and strafing targeting our delegation's residence in our Kaesong Neutral Zone on the night of August 22nd were military aircraft of the United Nations side. And what can most finally prove this point is the United Nations side's rogue attitude of persistently refusing to reinvestigate this matter to this day. In order to prove the correctness of their rogue attitude of refusing to reinvestigate, the United Nations side fabricated a large number of unfounded slanders. It was clear that our side agreed, and their liaison officer also agreed to come again on the 23rd to reinvestigate, but they reversed right and wrong, saying that our side refused them to come again during the daytime of August 23rd to reinvestigate. It was clear that our delegation spokesman again declared on August 26th that they were waiting for them to come again to reinvestigate, but they erased the facts and said that our side did not express its agreement to their reinvestigation again until such a late period as August 27th. Yes, on August 27th, Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai, in order to seek a reasonable solution to the problem, did express for the third time clearly that they requested them to conduct another investigation. But at this time, the United Nations side said it was too late, and reinvestigation was no longer meaningful.

　　Thus, everyone, look at the facts: As soon as the incident occurred, we asked them to come and conduct a joint investigation immediately. Their liaison officer came, but was extremely impatient to conduct a serious and responsible investigation, saying that it was inconvenient to investigate at night and that they would come the next day during the daytime. We agreed, but the next day during the daytime, they not only did not come, but also turned around and said that we refused them to come. Please investigate immediately; they used the excuse that they could not come to the meeting at night. Then come during the daytime; we agreed, and they also agreed to come, but they still did not come to investigate. It's too early to do it, then can it be done a little later? Still not. We asked them to come twice on the 26th and 27th, but they refused to come again. What did they say? It's too late, it's meaningless to come.

　　To put it bluntly, the purpose of this incoherent document issued by the United Nations Command Headquarters Press Bureau on the 28th is to evade the series of righteous and sharp questions raised by our Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai to General Ridgway on the 27th by spreading some absurd lies, and the focus is to find an excuse for their refusal to reinvestigate this serious incident. What excuse did they find? They said that the evidence that their liaison officer saw on the night of the 22nd was originally fabricated by our side and was untrustworthy. After these days, we can probably fabricate more credible evidence, so they cannot come to reinvestigate. I now want to ask the officials of that press bureau, why are you so confident that the evidence we have preserved is something we fabricated, and yet you dare not come to reinvestigate? Is it really impossible to distinguish between fabricated things and real things in your country? Forget it! Your attitude of refusing to reinvestigate no matter what only proves that the physical evidence and witness testimony of the incident are sufficient to fully prove that you are the unadulterated perpetrators of the August 22nd incident, and therefore you dare not come to Kaesong to face the crimes you have committed!

　　朝鲜人民军最高司令部
    中国人民志愿军司令部发言人发表谈话 
    驳斥美方无耻蒙蔽谋杀事件真相
    美方歪曲事实拒绝复查只能证明其作贼心虚
    【新华社平壤三十日电】八月二十八日联合国军总司令部新闻局发表一个官方文件。在这个文件中，该新闻局虽然涉及金日成将军与彭德怀将军八月二十七日致李奇微将军的复文中，对联合国军一再破坏开城中立区协议事件所作的有理有据的指责，但又不敢将金彭两将军义正词严的复文全文发表，使世人能明了金彭两将军复文的全貌。另一方面该新闻局却歪曲事实，蒙蔽真相，企图逃脱和推卸联合国军一再破坏开城中立区协议的责任。这是一种极其不严肃和不负责任的行为。朝鲜人民军最高司令部及中国人民志愿军司令部发言人为了使世人明了事件的真相，特就上述联合国军新闻局公布的此一官方文件，发表声明，加以驳斥。声明全文如下：
    联合国军总司令部新闻局，为了淆乱世人视听，掩盖事实真相，在其八月二十八日公布的文件中，故意夸大和歪曲在开城谈判期间新闻记者到会址区采访及我方军事警察误入会址区的问题，以及联合国军代表团仅使一人及代表团坐车一辆偶然有一次被我方军事警察留阻几分钟的问题，其实这些问题都已有我方采取认真负责的态度和平等对待的原则以及有利停战谈判的立场加以合理处理，而且联合国军方面也已对于这些处理表示满意了。该新闻局一方面夸大和歪曲这些早已不成问题的问题，另一方面对八月十九日联合国军武装人员非法侵入中立区，谋杀我军事警察排长姚庆祥及重伤战士王仁元，以及八月二十二日联合国军飞机轰炸和扫射我方代表团住所，谋杀我代表团人员的严重事件，却尽其造谣与诬蔑之能事，企图逃脱与抵赖其所应负的重大责任。
    关于姚庆祥排长被杀事件，我方首席代表南日将军在其八月二十八日发表的详细报告中，已经用铁的人证与物证，雄辩地证实了这一谋杀事件是联合国军所属部队所作的非法勾当。就是联合国方面联络官穆莱上校在双方联络官共同调查时及联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃将军在给我方代表团首席代表南日将军的复信中，也都不能否认这一事实。但是事后，联合国军方面非仅不接受我方对这一破坏中立区协议、谋杀我方按照协议执行任务的军事警察事件而提出的严惩凶手及彻底保证不再发生违反中立区的任何事件的合理要求，反而通过它的新闻局发表推诿责任的谎言，说什么当日实行谋杀的穿着军装、拿起武器、侵入中立区的“大韩民国”部队，不在联合国军军事指挥及控制之下。不但如此，该新闻局更丧天害理地说我方军事警察未加抵抗，似乎是死有应得。但是出事地点的村民却在双方调查时，明白证实了谋杀姚庆祥的武装人员，是从中立区外侵入中立区的，而且在谋杀以后，又从中立区逃回到中立区以外去了。这是证明这些穿着军装拿起武器侵入中立区来谋杀姚庆祥排长的武装人员，就是在联合国军控制之下的武装人员。这些武装人员，是从几公里以外的联合国军地区内非法潜入中立区的，假使没有联合国军的掩护和支持，这些武装人员早就被消灭了。问题的重心不在于仅持有警察武器的我方军事警察未能消灭他们，而在于联合国军对于这批武装人员的包庇。而联合国军对于这批武装人员的包庇，不正证明这些武装人员是联合国军的一部分吗？
    对于联合国军军用飞机八月二十二日夜空袭开城中立区的事件，联合国军总部新闻局也在他们发表的官方文件中，企图抵赖投掷炸弹的军用飞机是联合国军的军用飞机，甚至诬指这个事件是我方人员所制造。为了证明这个诬蔑，该新闻局不惜歪曲事实颠倒是非，硬说我方联络官曾拒绝联合国军联络官白昼再来调查。然而事有凑巧，联合国军所属第五航空队的雷达侦察报告，又恰好证实在发生轰炸与扫射时曾有一架未经识别的飞机出现在开城以西。而这一架未经识别的飞机，既是未经识别的，又何以能识别出它是我方的飞机？这难道不是此地无银二百两的不打自招吗？
    说这一架飞机轰炸与扫射我方代表团住所一事，是我方人员所为，那简直是丧心病狂的胡说。首先就不可能设想一种为了任何目的而不惜谋杀自己的代表团的事。我们可以断定，全世界除了丧尽天良的美国将军们以外，是没有一个人敢于如此设想的。其次，从此次联合国军军用飞机投弹的具体情形看，这些投下的炸弹中的绝大部分落在离我代表团住所不过一、二百公尺附近的地方。任何一个稍有空军轰炸常识的人，都知道要控制自己的投弹只落在离目的地二、三百公尺的地方，而却绝不命中目的地的轰炸，几乎是完全不可能的事。因此，若不是以谋杀自己的代表团人员为目的，这种只投弹于离自己的代表团住所如此近的地方，但又不以命中它为目的，而事先布置轰炸，这是不可能设想的。
    其实，这种丧心病狂的诬蔑，是骗不了任何人的。相反，联合国军方面愈宣传这种诬蔑，就愈更证明这个以谋杀我方代表团为目的的不法的严重的挑衅行为，正是联合国军自己干的。原状不动地被保存在现场的物证，和作为人证的开城市的全体居民，证明八月二十二日夜以我开城中立区内我方代表团住所为目标进行谋杀性的轰炸与扫射的军用飞机，是联合国军方面的军用飞机。而最能最后证明这一点的，则是联合国军方面一直到现在还在坚持着的拒绝对此事进行复查的无赖态度。为了证明他们这种拒绝复查的无赖态度之正确，联合国军方面捏造了一大堆毫无根据的谰言。分明是我方同意，他们的联络官也答应了二十三日再来复查，但他们确颠倒是非，说我方拒绝他们于八月二十三日白天再来复查。分明是我方代表团发言人于八月二十六日即又再度声明等待他们再来复查，但他们却抹煞事实说：我方一直到八月二十七日那样迟的时期才又再次表示同意他们复查。是的，在八月二十七日，金日成最高司令官和彭德怀司令员，为了求得问题的合理解决，确是第三次地明确地表示要求他们再来进行调查。但是到了此时，联合国军方面又说太迟了，复查已经没有任何意义了。
    这样，大家看事实吧：事件一发生，我们要求他们来立即共同进行调查。他们的联络官来了，就极不耐烦作认真负责的调查，说是黑夜不便调查，要第二天白天来。我们答应了，但第二天白天他们不仅没有来，而且反咬一口说我们拒绝他们来。请他们立即调查，他们借口黑夜不能来开会，那么白天来吧，我们同意了，他们也答应来了，但他们仍然不来调查。早了不干，迟一点可以干了吧？还是不然。我们二十六日，二十七日两次要求他们来，但他们又拒绝来了。说什么呢？太迟了，来了没有意义。
    揭穿了说，二十八日联合国军总司令部新闻局发表的这篇语无伦次的文件，其目的，就是在用散布些无稽的谎言，逃避我金日成最高司令官和彭德怀司令员二十七日向李奇微将军提出的一系列的义正词严的尖锐问题，而其重心则为他们拒绝对此次严重事件进行复查找借口。他们找着个什么借口呢？他们说，原来二十二日夜间他们联络官所看到的证据，本来就是我方伪造的不足信的东西，过了这些天，我们大概可以伪造出更能取信的证据来了，因此他们不能来复查了。我现在倒要问问那个新闻局的官员们，何以你们如此有信心说，我们保存下来的证据是我们伪造的东西，而又不敢前来复查呢？难道在你们的国家里，伪造的东西和实在的东西，真是没有区别吗？算了吧！你们这种无论如何都拒绝复查的态度，只证明事件的物证和人证，足以充分证实你们是八月二十二日事件的不折不扣的制造者，因而不敢前来开城面对你们所制造的罪行！
