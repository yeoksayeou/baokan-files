To the Editor:

    After Beijing's Third District promoted support for the army and preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, the people's respect and assistance for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers has further increased. Liu Bai, a military family member living at No. 27, Lane 7, Section 4 of this district, fell ill. Her neighbors, the Ma Shufang mother and daughter, automatically helped her buy medicine, boil it, light the stove, and cook. They also helped her collect the preferential treatment grain for military families. Sun Ping, a military family member, returned from the hospital after giving birth and did not have a house to live in. The district office helped her find a house in the civilian residences of Section 18. Guan Cheng, a resident in the same courtyard as Sun Ping, automatically lent her a bed board, Xiao Yang lent her a stove, and He Jiang, the women's representative of the lane, sent her bowls, chopsticks, and other utensils. With everyone's help, Sun Ping immediately had a warm new home.

    On the second day of the establishment of the Section 9 Veterans Affairs Committee branch, the committee members used a pushcart with a small red flag to transport preferential treatment grain to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. They said, "Those who receive preferential treatment grain from the government generally lack labor, so we should help in this way." The families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers were very happy. Some old ladies said, "Let's not talk about how much money we save, this is truly an honor!" Under the Veterans Affairs Committee, this section also established a "Youth Mobile Team" to regularly serve the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who lack labor.

    北京第三区经过拥军优属宣传  群众更加敬爱烈属军属了编辑同志：
    北京市第三区经过拥军优属宣传以后，群众对于革命烈士家属和革命军人家属的尊敬和帮助更见增加了。本区第四段七条胡同二十七号军属刘白氏生了病，同院的邻居马淑芳母女就自动帮助她买药熬药，点炉子做饭，又代她去领了军属优待粮。军属孙平刚从医院生了孩子回来，没有房子住，区公所帮助她在十八段平民住宅找好了房子。孙平刚同院的住户关程氏自动借给铺板，萧杨氏借给炉子，本胡同妇女代表何蒋氏又给她送去碗筷等用具。在大家帮助之下，孙平刚马上有了一个温暖的新屋。
    第九段优抚委员支会成立的第二天，委员们就用一辆排子车，上面插着小红旗，去给烈属军属运送优待粮。他们说：“要政府发优待粮的一般都缺少劳动力，我们应该这样帮助。”烈军属高兴得很，有的老太太说：“省多少钱先不用说，这真是光荣了！”该段在优抚委员会下面，还建立了“青年流动小组”，准备经常为缺乏劳动力的烈属军属服务。
