　　Remembering the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising
　　He Long
　　The "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising is the day the Chinese People's Army – its predecessors being the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and now the Chinese People's Liberation Army – was born. In China, the emergence of an army completely under the leadership of the Communist Party, wholeheartedly fighting for the cause of the people's liberation, has propelled the Chinese revolutionary struggle into a new historical period. This is because in China, the enemies of the revolution – foreign imperialist aggressors and their running dogs, the Chinese feudal and comprador rulers – are exceptionally powerful enemies. If the Chinese people do not arm themselves to fight against the enemy, they cannot achieve victory and liberation. Therefore, the main form of the Chinese revolution, as Comrade Stalin said in "The Prospects of the Chinese Revolution," can only be "armed revolution against armed counter-revolution." Without the people's armed forces, without a revolutionary army, the people have nothing. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in "The Communists," without armed struggle, there would be no status for the Chinese people, no status for the proletariat, no victory for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution. It is precisely because our Party and our Party's talented and brilliant leader, Chairman Mao, have increasingly deeply recognized the importance of armed struggle and creating a revolutionary army from the summary of revolutionary experiences, and have personally led, educated, cultivated, and built this army from the day it was born, that it has developed and grown stronger in the arduous and heroic struggle of the past twenty-four years, through the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, under the extremely difficult conditions of fighting against powerful enemies, and finally defeated imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, achieving victory on a national scale and opening up broad avenues for the completion of new democratic construction and entry into socialism.

　　Today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has become a powerful and invincible army, with sufficient strength to defend the security of our people's motherland and to defend peace in the Far East and the world. It is the happiness and glory of the Chinese people to have such an army that wholeheartedly serves the people and is armed with patriotism and internationalism. This is the glory of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. However, in the face of constant attacks from powerful enemies, creating and building such a people's army, making it grow from small to large and from weak to strong, has been a very difficult and tortuous path. The most fundamental factor why we have been able to continuously overcome serious difficulties and achieve great victories is that our army, from the day it was born, has had the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, gives us endless fighting courage and strength to overcome difficulties. The military thought that Mao Zedong demonstrated in the revolutionary war constitutes a complete military line guiding the Chinese revolutionary war toward victory. Studying Mao Zedong's military line, like studying his political line, is an important current lesson for every commander and fighter of the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, commemorating the August 1st Army Day of the Nanchang Uprising, and understanding Chairman Mao's military thought from the memories of the creation and development history of our people's army, so that our army building and national defense construction can be developed and improved more rapidly, is of great practical significance for us today.

　　The "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising was when the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, armed themselves to give a powerful counterattack to the betrayal of the Kuomintang reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek who had surrendered to imperialism, and raised the bright banner of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, resolutely carrying out armed struggle. This was a victory of Mao Zedong Thought over Chen Duxiu's right-wing opportunism. I remember on the eve of the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising, the internal and external situation was extremely urgent. Chiang Kai-shek launched a counter-revolutionary coup and massacre in Shanghai on April 12th; a counter-revolutionary coup and massacre also occurred in Changsha on May 21st; and the Kuomintang in Wuhan also openly betrayed the revolution on July 15th. At that time, the opportunist leading group of the Chinese Communist Party, represented by Chen Duxiu, at such a critical juncture, not only did not resolutely launch mass struggles to promote the development of the revolutionary movement and counterattack the attacks of counter-revolutionaries, but on the contrary, adopted a shameful policy of surrender to the counter-revolution, daring not develop the peasant struggle and daring not arm the workers and peasants. This facilitated the counter-revolution's attack on the revolutionary masses, causing the failure of the First Domestic Revolutionary War. And Comrade Mao Zedong at that time strongly advocated boldly mobilizing and arming the workers and peasants. The more resolute the revolutionaries, the more they can stop the counter-revolution's attack and end the vacillation of the middle-of-the-roaders. On the basis of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, independently took up arms for the first time and launched a powerful counterattack against the counter-revolution. This led to the outbreak of the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising, and the accompanying peasant uprisings in Hubei, the Autumn Harvest Armed Uprising in Hunan personally led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the peasant uprisings in Haifeng and Lufeng in Guangdong, the December Uprising in Guangzhou, and the Hunan Uprising led by Comrade Zhu De. The armies produced in these uprisings formed the earliest Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, which later developed into the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the current Chinese People's Liberation Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan.

　　Now, looking back, the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising was only the beginning of our Party's understanding of armed struggle. Regarding Chairman Mao's thought on armed struggle, such as the essence of armed struggle in China being a peasant war, the revolutionary army should combine with the workers' and peasants' mass movement, develop workers' and peasants' armed forces, and create rural revolutionary base areas to accumulate and strengthen its own strength in order to achieve the goal of eliminating the enemy. Regarding the above basic issues in the Chinese revolutionary armed struggle, we either did not understand or understood very superficially at that time. After the Nanchang Uprising, the issue of where the army should go was not correctly resolved. At that time, the peasant movement in the two lakes and Jiangxi, especially in Hunan, was very high. The uprising army should have combined with the peasant movement in Xiang and Gan, created revolutionary base areas, and insisted on long-term guerrilla warfare to strengthen itself and eliminate the enemy. However, our thinking and understanding of creating revolutionary base areas and carrying out long-term guerrilla warfare were very weak at that time, so the Nanchang Uprising army did not combine with the peasant movement in Xiang and Gan, but marched south towards Guangdong. At the same time, it lacked specific action guidelines suitable for the local conditions at that time. In the long march, the troops themselves did not well establish political work. In addition, the enemy's strength was objectively strong, and the subjective guidance lacked experience. Therefore, most of the Nanchang Uprising troops suffered losses, and only a portion of the force was retained to join forces with the workers' and peasants' armed forces of the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Chairman Mao in Jinggangshan, before the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was formally established.

　　The revolutionary army must combine with the peasant movement, implement land reform to mobilize the broad masses of peasants, create revolutionary base areas, insist on long-term guerrilla warfare, and use the revolutionary countryside to encircle the counter-revolutionary cities and finally capture the cities. In army building, the people's army must establish a strong leadership with the Party as the core, with strong political work and strict mass discipline, and implement people's war relying on the masses. In the guidance of war, it is necessary to implement a strategic war of attrition and tactical quick decisions, dispersing troops to mobilize the masses in peacetime, and concentrating superior forces to encircle and annihilate the enemy in wartime. This correct line guiding the Chinese revolutionary war was not completely and ingeniously resolved by Comrade Mao Zedong until the Jinggangshan meeting and the subsequent revolutionary wars. In the struggles of the past twenty years, it is precisely because of the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct ideological line that the revolutionary forces have been developed and strengthened, to the point of achieving national victory. When we firmly implemented Chairman Mao's correct ideological line in that period and in that region, the revolutionary struggle there was developed, the base area was consolidated and expanded, and the army was also developed and consolidated. And whenever we deviated from Chairman Mao's correct line, whether we embarked on the path of left-leaning opportunism or right-leaning opportunism, the revolutionary forces would suffer losses, or the revolutionary struggle would lead to failure. When I recall the revolutionary struggle in the Xiang-E-Xi base area during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, this experience is very painful and profound. At that time, our understanding and experience of Chairman Mao's political line and military line were very insufficient. Due to the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, the base area was expanding and developing day by day, and the Red Army reached 80,000 at its largest. We and other comrades who created the Xiang-E-Xi base area could only receive fragmented news of the struggle in the central base area, from which to understand and learn Chairman Mao's thoughts and experiences on how to lead guerrilla warfare, build revolutionary base areas, and build the army. Although this period was very immature, we learned and experienced certain parts of Chairman Mao's military thought from actual struggle, which enabled the revolutionary struggle in the base area to be widely carried out. But at this time, due to the errors of the left-leaning opportunist line, the young Red Army was required to attack the central cities defended by powerful enemies, causing the Red Army to move away from the base area and detach from the mass struggle in the base area. As a result, the base area shrank, and the Red Army also suffered losses.

　　However, later we relied on the local Party and the masses to continue to mobilize the masses, organize workers' and peasants' armed forces, and the revolution developed again, the base area was restored, and the Red Army was expanded again. Subsequently, under the erroneous guidance of another opportunist line, we opposed guerrilla warfare and fought positional warfare with the enemy, consuming our strength, and at the same time, we mistakenly carried out so-called "suppression of counter-revolutionaries," which harmed and weakened ourselves. In this way, the damage to the revolution was very serious. From the lessons of failure, we gradually experienced Chairman Mao's thoughts and corrected the erroneous left-leaning opportunist line, and we were able to develop again. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, because we resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's strategic policy of "developing independent and autonomous guerrilla warfare, but not relaxing mobile warfare under favorable conditions," our various anti-Japanese democratic base areas have greatly developed. The more profoundly that area understood and the more resolutely and thoroughly it implemented it, the greater its development and victory. Conversely, if that area did not understand Chairman Mao's strategic policy enough, or if there were deviations in its implementation, its development and victory would be greatly limited, and even the revolution would suffer some unnecessary losses. After the Kuomintang withdrew from Wuhan in 1938, especially from 1941 to 1943, due to the passive observation of the Kuomintang's front battlefield, the Japanese invaders launched large-scale return offensives behind enemy lines and carried out repeated and cruel "encirclement and suppression," and a large number of Kuomintang troops surrendered to the enemy and coordinated with the Japanese invaders to attack us. In addition, the droughts and insect plagues in North China added to our great difficulties. The base area shrank, and the army was reduced. At this most difficult juncture, Chairman Mao pointed out new struggle guidelines and methods, implemented the struggle of unified leadership of military, political, economic, and cultural affairs, and organized armed work teams to compete with the enemy for points and areas. Because our various regions resolutely and actively implemented this struggle, achieved victory in this struggle, and survived the most difficult period from 1942 to 1943, the various anti-Japanese base areas were developed again, and our army was expanded and improved. This can be said to be an important key to winning the War of Resistance Against Japan, and even winning the Third Domestic Revolutionary War. In the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, Chairman Mao further highly developed the rich experience of long-term armed struggle in the past, put forward the strategic policy of focusing on mobile warfare, concentrating superior forces, and annihilating the enemy's living forces, and clearly stipulated the ten major military principles for winning the war, which played a decisive role in guiding the Third Domestic Revolutionary War toward victory.

　　Since the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising twenty-four years ago, the history of our people's army building and struggle has made us deeply realize that the history of the development and construction of our army and the history of the victory of armed struggle are the history of the development and victory of Chairman Mao's military thought and military line. As a participant in the Nanchang Uprising, in the past twenty-four years, relying on Chairman Mao's teachings and the experience of actual struggle, I have increasingly deeply and clearly recognized the important position of armed struggle in the Chinese revolutionary struggle. I have realized how to build a people's army that is wholeheartedly dedicated to the complete liberation of the Chinese people and fights tirelessly with the Party's leadership as the core. I have learned the flexible strategic and tactical principles of the people's army that conducts victorious struggles. However, in order to understand Chairman Mao's entire military thought and line, and integrate it into the current great cause of national defense construction and national defense army building, we should also intensify our efforts to study with the attitude of elementary school students. Therefore, let us work together with all the commanders and fighters of the army to study and implement Chairman Mao's political and military line, establish the idea of always being a fighting team, closely rely on the masses, be conscientious and meticulous, prevent arrogance and complacency, so as to accelerate the construction of a regular, modernized national defense army, liberate Taiwan, implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, eliminate bandits and special agents, consolidate national defense, and strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship. And with a high degree of internationalism, defend peace in the Far East and the world. This is our glorious combat mission to commemorate the August 1st Army Day.

　　回忆“八一”南昌起义
    贺龙
    “八一”南昌起义，是中国人民军队——它的前身是中国工农红军、八路军、新四军、现在的中国人民解放军——诞生的日子。在中国，自从出现了一支完全在共产党领导之下全心全意为人民的解放事业而战斗的军队，就将中国革命的斗争推进到一个新的历史时期。因为在中国，革命的敌人外国帝国主义侵略者，和它的走狗中国封建、买办统治者，这是异常强大的敌人。中国人民如果不武装起来去和敌人进行斗争，就不能得到胜利和解放。所以，中国革命的主要形式，正如斯大林同志在《论中国革命的前途》一文中所说的，只能是“武装的革命反对武装的反革命”。没有人民的武装，没有革命的军队，就没有人民的一切。也正如毛泽东同志在《共产党人发刊词》中所说的，离开了武装斗争，就没有中国人民的地位，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有共产党的胜利，就没有革命的胜利。正是由于我们党和我们党天才英明的领袖毛主席从总结革命的经验中日益深刻地认识了武装斗争与创立革命军队的重要性，从这支军队诞生之日起，就亲自领导、教育、培养、建设这支军队，使得它在二十四年的艰苦而英勇的斗争中，经过了第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争，在和强大的敌人作战极端困难的条件下，发展壮大起来，终于战胜了帝国主义和它的走狗国民党反动派，取得了全国范围的胜利，并为完成新民主主义建设及进入社会主义开辟了广阔的道路。
    今天，中国人民解放军已经成为一支强大无敌的军队，它有足够的力量来保卫我们人民祖国的安全和保卫远东与世界的和平。中国人民有了这样一支全心全意为人民服务，以爱国主义和国际主义精神所武装起来的军队，这是中国人民的幸福与光荣。这是中国共产党和毛主席的光荣。但是，在强大敌人不断进攻的面前，创造与建设这样一支人民的军队，使它从小到大，从弱到强，是经历了一条非常困难曲折的道路的。我们所以能够不断克服严重的困难而取得伟大的胜利，在许多因素中最基本的因素，就是我们的军队从诞生之日起，就有共产党和毛主席朱总司令的英明领导。以马克思列宁主义与中国革命具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想，给我们以无穷尽的战斗勇气与克服困难的力量。毛泽东同志在革命战争中所发挥的军事思想，构成了指导中国革命战争走向胜利完整的军事路线。学习毛泽东的军事路线，和学习他的政治路线一样，是我们每一个人民解放军指战员当前重要的课程。所以，我们纪念南昌起义的八一建军节，从我们人民军队创立和它发展历史的回忆中，来体会毛主席的军事思想，使我们的军队建设和国防建设，得到更迅速地发展和提高，今天对于我们是有着非常重大实际意义的。
    “八一”南昌起义，是中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，武装起来给以蒋介石为首的投降帝国主义的国民党反动派的叛变以有力反击，高举起中国革命斗争鲜明的旗帜，坚决进行武装斗争。这是毛泽东思想与陈独秀右派机会主义斗争的胜利。记得“八一”南昌起义的前夜，内外情况是异常紧急的，蒋介石在四月十二日就在上海举行了反革命的政变与屠杀；五月二十一日长沙又发生了反革命的政变与屠杀；七月十五日武汉的国民党也公开地叛变了革命。而当时中国共产党以陈独秀为代表的机会主义领导集团，在这样紧急的关头，不但没有坚决地去发动群众的斗争以推进革命运动的发展，去回击反革命分子的进攻；相反的，对于反革命却采取了可耻的投降政策，不敢发展农民斗争，不敢武装工农。这样就便利了反革命对革命群众的进攻，使第一次国内革命战争遭受了失败。而毛泽东同志，当时是极力主张放手发动和武装工农群众的。革命者越坚决，越可以制止反革命的进攻，与中止中间派的动摇。在毛泽东同志这样的思想基础上，中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，第一次独立地拿起了武器，向反革命进行有力的还击。这样就爆发了“八一”南昌起义，和相随而来的湖北农民起义，毛泽东同志亲自领导的湖南农民的秋收武装起义，广东海、陆丰的农民起义，广州的十二月起义，以及朱德同志所领导的湖南起义。在这些起义中所产生的军队，就组成了最早的中国工农红军，后来又发展成为抗日时期的八路军、新四军和现在的中国人民解放军。
    现在回想起来，“八一”南昌起义仅是我们党认识武装斗争的开始。对于毛主席的武装斗争的思想，例如在中国的武装斗争实质上是农民战争，革命军队应与工农群众运动相结合，发展工农武装，创立农村的革命根据地，以积蓄壮大自己的力量，去达到消灭敌人的目的，对于上述中国革命武装斗争中的基本问题，我们当时还是不了解或了解得十分浮浅的。南昌起义之后，军队往那里去的问题，没有得到正确的解决。当时两湖、江西，特别是湖南的农民运动是很高涨的，起义的军队应当与湘、赣的农民运动相结合，创造革命根据地，坚持长期的游击战争，从中来壮大自己、消灭敌人。而我们当时对于创造革命根据地与进行长期游击战争的思想与认识十分微弱，所以南昌起义的军队没有与湘、赣的农民运动相结合，而南下向广东进发。同时又缺乏适合当时当地情况的具体行动方针，在长途的进军中，部队本身没有很好地建立政治工作，加上在客观上敌人的力量强大，而主观上的指导又缺乏经验，因而南昌起义的部队大部遭受损失，仅保留了一部分力量与毛主席所领导的秋收起义的工农武装在井冈山会师，才正式成立了中国工农红军。
    革命军队必须与农民运动相结合，实行土地革命以发动广大农民群众，创造革命根据地，坚持长期的游击战争，以革命的农村包围反革命的城市而最后夺取城市。在军队建设上，人民军队必须建立以党为核心的坚强的领导，与坚强的政治工作和严格的群众纪律，实行依靠群众的人民战争。在战争的指导上，必须实行战略的持久战和战役的速决战，平时分兵以发动群众，战时集中优势兵力以包围迂回和歼灭敌人。指导中国革命战争的这条正确路线，直到井冈山会师，以及以后的革命战争中，才为毛泽东同志天才而完整地解决了。在二十多年来的斗争中，正是由于毛主席这条正确思想路线的指导，革命的力量才得到发展壮大，以至于取得了全国的胜利。当着我们在那一个时期及那一个地区坚决执行毛主席正确思想路线的时候，那里的革命斗争就得到发展，根据地就能够巩固扩大，军队也就得到发展和巩固。而凡是离开了毛主席正确路线的时候，不管是走上了左倾机会主义或者是右倾机会主义的道路，都会使革命力量遭受损失，或使革命斗争走向失败。当我回忆第二次国内革命战争时期的湘鄂西根据地革命斗争的时候，这个体会是十分沉痛和深刻的。当时我们对于毛主席的政治路线和军事路线是了解体会很不够的。由于群众革命情绪的高涨，根据地是一天天扩大发展了，红军发展到最大的时候曾达到八万人。我们和创造湘鄂西根据地的其他同志们，仅能零碎地得到中央根据地斗争的消息，从中来体会与学习毛主席如何领导游击战争，建设革命根据地与建设军队的思想和经验。这期间虽然十分幼稚，但是我们从实际斗争中学习与体会到毛主席军事思想的某些部分，才使革命根据地的斗争获得了广泛的开展。但是正在这时由于左倾机会主义路线的错误，要当时年幼的红军进攻有强大敌人防御的中心城市，使红军远离根据地，脱离了根据地群众斗争的配合，结果根据地缩小了，红军也遭受到损失。
    但是后来我们又依靠了当地的党和群众，继续发动群众，组织工农武装，革命又发展起来了，根据地又恢复了，红军又扩大了。继而在另一种机会主义路线的错误指导下，反对游击战争，而和敌人打阵地战，拚消耗，同时错误地进行所谓“肃反”而伤害与削弱了自己。这样，给予革命的损害又是十分严重的。从失败的教训中，逐步体验了毛主席的思想，纠正了左倾机会主义的错误路线，我们又才得到了发展。抗日战争中，由于我们坚决执行了毛主席“开展独立自主的游击战，但不放松有利条件下的运动战”的战略方针，我们各个抗日民主根据地都得到了很大发展。而那个地区体会得更深刻，实行得更坚决彻底，则它的发展与胜利更大。反之，那个地区对于毛主席这个战略方针体会得不够，或者是执行上有偏差，则它的发展和胜利就受到很大的限制，甚至使革命遭遇某些不应有的损失。一九三八年国民党退出武汉以后，特别是一九四一年到一九四三年，由于国民党正面战场的消极观战，日寇大举回师敌后进行反复残酷的“清剿”“扫荡”，大批国民党军队投敌，配合日寇向我进攻。加上华北的水旱虫灾，使我们增加了极大的困难。根据地缩小了，军队减少了。在这最困难的关头，毛主席又指出了新的斗争方针与方法，执行军事、政治、经济、文化一元化领导的斗争，组织武装工作队与敌人进行点与面的争夺。由于我们各个地区坚决积极地执行了这一斗争，取得了这一斗争的胜利，度过一九四二年到一九四三年最困难时期，各个抗日根据地又得到了发展，我们军队又得到了扩大与提高。这对于争取抗日战争的胜利，甚至争取第三次国内革命战争的胜利，都可以说是一个重要的关键。在第三次国内革命战争中，毛主席更高度发展了过去长期武装斗争的丰富经验，提出了以运动战为主，集中优势兵力，歼灭敌人有生力量的作战方针，明确地规定了争取战争胜利的十大军事原则，对于指导第三次国内革命战争走向胜利起了决定性的作用。
    自“八一”南昌起义二十四年以来，我们人民军队建军和斗争的历史，使我们极其深刻地体会到：我们军队建设发展的历史，武装斗争胜利的历史，就是毛主席军事思想、军事路线发展和胜利的历史。作为一个南昌起义的参加者，二十四年来依靠着毛主席的教导和实际斗争的体会，使我日益深刻明确地认识了武装斗争在中国革命斗争中的重要地位。体会到以党的领导为核心如何去建设一支全心全意为中国人民彻底解放而奋战不息的人民军队。学习到进行胜利斗争的人民军队灵活的战略战术。但是要体会毛主席的全部军事思想和路线，并把它融会贯通于当前伟大的国防建设事业与国防军建设中去，我们还应当以小学生的态度去加紧努力学习，因此，和全军指战员同志们共同努力来学习与贯彻执行毛主席政治军事路线，树立永远是战斗队的思想，紧密依靠群众，兢兢业业，防止骄傲与自满，以加速建设正规化、现代化的国防军，解放台湾，贯彻执行和平解放西藏办法协议，肃清土匪特务，巩固祖国国防，与加强人民民主专政。并以高度的国际主义精神保卫远东与世界的和平，这是我们纪念八一建军节光荣的战斗任务。
