Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 14th: This reporter learned from the Korean Front Headquarters: The twenty-fourth meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations was held at 10:00 AM (Korean time) on August 14th and ended at 12:45 PM. The twenty-fifth meeting is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on August 15th.

General Nam Il, the chief representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, once again refuted the other side's boasting of the independent superiority of their naval and air forces at the twenty-fourth meeting. He condemned their absurd and arrogant plan to use the pretext of establishing defensive positions to insist on pushing the entire military demarcation line and demilitarized zone north of the 38th parallel and into our positions. General Nam Il pointed out that although the other side constantly claimed that their plan could be adjusted at any time and that they were willing to discuss any plan based on the existing battle lines and military situation, their statements at the meeting repeatedly confirmed that their so-called adjustment of the military demarcation line was an adjustment within our positions north of the 38th parallel. Their so-called plan based on the existing battle lines and military situation was simply a plan to insist on pushing the entire military demarcation line and demilitarized zone north of the 38th parallel and deep into our positions. General Nam Il declared that as long as the other side insists on its absurd and arrogant plan and refuses to discuss our fair and reasonable plan of using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, the deadlock in the meeting will not be broken. If the other side is truly sincere in breaking the deadlock and negotiating an armistice, they must first fundamentally abandon their absurd and arrogant plan for the military demarcation line.

　　南日将军再斥美方狂妄要求
    中外记者继续揭露美方对谈判无诚意
    【新华社平壤十四日电】本社记者由朝鲜前线总部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议第二十四次会议在八月十四日上午十时举行（朝鲜时间），十二时四十五分结束。第二十五次会议，定于八月十五日上午十时举行。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军，在第二十四次会议上再度驳斥对方夸炫海空军的独立优势，借口建立防御阵地，而坚持将军事分界线与非军事区全部推进至三八线以北我方阵地之内的荒谬狂妄方案。南日将军指出：对方虽然不断声称对方方案是随时可以调整的，并愿讨论任何一个以现有战线和军事形势为基础的方案，但实际上对方在会议上的发言，一再证实其所谓调整军事分界线是在三八线以北我方阵地之内的调整。其所谓以现有战线和军事形势为基础的方案，只是坚持将军事分界线及非军事区全部推进至三八线以北深入我方阵地之内的方案。南日将军声明：只要对方一日坚持其荒谬狂妄方案而拒绝讨论我方以三八线为军事分界线的公平合理的方案，则会议的僵局将一日不能打开。如对方确有打开僵局谈判停战的诚意，则必须首先根本放弃其荒谬狂妄的军事分界线方案。
