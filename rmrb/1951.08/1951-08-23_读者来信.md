　　Support the People's Government's Severe Punishment of American Secret Agents and Spies
    Salute to the Personnel of the Beijing Public Security Organs

    Editor's Note: Since this newspaper published the news of the Beijing Military Control Commission Military Law Department's verdict on the case of American secret agents and spies plotting an armed rebellion on August 18, we have received 51 letters from six organizations and 83 readers as of the 20th. These letters unanimously support the government's correct measures. In addition to the three letters published on the 19th, we are selecting seven more for publication today:

    (I) Editor Comrades:

    We wholeheartedly support the verdict of the Beijing Military Control Commission Military Law Department on the case of American secret agents and spies plotting an armed rebellion.

    This case has aroused our extreme hatred and anger towards American imperialism. The heinous enemy is attempting to assassinate the leaders beloved by the Chinese people, which the Chinese people will never tolerate! From this despicable and vicious plot, we have further recognized the hideous face of the Chinese people's irreconcilable and ferocious enemy - American imperialism. American imperialism has invaded China for more than a hundred years, and finally suffered a shameful defeat in the face of the Chinese people. However, the imperialists are not reconciled to their failure. In addition to launching aggressive wars madly, they are also plotting to organize armed rebellions on our mainland. The Chinese people must resist America and aid Korea, defeat imperialist aggression, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, and cut off the claws of imperialism invading China, and never allow them to talk nonsense and act recklessly on our liberated, free and sacred land.

    The cracking of this case is a major victory on our invisible front. Therefore, we salute the public security personnel who solved the case!

    Let the imperialist elements tremble in front of the Chinese people who have stood up! Look, this is the fate of American secret agents and spies!

    This incident has deeply educated us, strengthened our hatred for American imperialism, and raised our vigilance. We must wage a serious and resolute struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries to defend our victory.

    (II) Editor Comrades:

    After reading the news of the Beijing Military Control Commission Military Law Department's verdict on the case of American secret agents and spies plotting an armed rebellion, my hatred for imperialism has increased. This verdict by the government is fully in line with the interests of all the Chinese people. At the same time, it warned the imperialists: The great Chinese people are inviolable!

    The great Chinese Communist Party, leading the Chinese people, after thirty years of arduous struggle, finally defeated the reactionary rule at home, expelled the imperialist aggressive forces in China, and achieved today's great victory. However, the imperialists are not reconciled to their failure. The evil American secret agents and spies such as Li Andong, under the instruction of their masters, collected intelligence and planned armed rebellions in our country. They even妄想 to炮轰 Tiananmen Square and assassinate our people's leaders on last year's National Day. Such criminal actions are intolerable to the Chinese people! This case makes the Chinese people more clearly aware that American imperialism is the Chinese people's irreconcilable enemy! The Chinese people will continue to heighten vigilance, resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries, and strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, giving American imperialism an even greater blow!

    (III) Editor Comrades:

    We are young people of ethnic minorities. In the past, we ethnic minorities, like our Han compatriots, suffered the ravages and persecution of imperialism. The disasters they brought us are countless. We deeply remember this hatred!

    The People's Government sentenced American secret agents and spies for plotting a rebellion and executed the American spy Li Andong and Yamaguchi Ryuichi. This correct measure is fully in line with the people's wishes. This shows that the Chinese people who have stood up are sacred and inviolable. If any imperialist elements dare to sabotage our motherland, we will definitely be able to completely eliminate them!

    We firmly support the government's wise measure. In the future, we must be more vigilant to prevent the activities of secret agents.

    (IV)

    American secret agents and spies Li Andong and Yamaguchi Ryuichi were sentenced to death by the Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission. The government's handling of this is completely correct. From the conspiracies of bandits Li Andong, Yamaguchi Ryuichi, etc., we can deeply see that American imperialism is deliberately hostile to the Chinese people. However, no matter how insidious and vicious it is, the Chinese people are fully capable of smashing its conspiracies. The shameful end of the two criminals, Li Andong and Yamaguchi Ryuichi, represents the inevitable end of all invaders. The Chinese people must heighten vigilance, continue to struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, and consolidate our victory.

    (V) Editor Comrades:

    On the afternoon of the 17th, we personally saw two foreign secret agents and spies being escorted to the execution ground on both sides of Wangfujing Street. We felt extremely happy!

    Under the policy of national betrayal and capitulation of the reactionary rulers in the past hundred years, imperialist elements flaunted their power in China and arbitrarily oppressed the Chinese people. Only today, in the people's democratic dictatorship, can the Chinese people truly hold their heads high. Our government resolutely suppresses counter-revolutionaries, which fully represents the will of the Chinese people. Any imperialist elements who dare to harm our revolutionary cause cannot escape the severe sanctions of the people!

    The soldiers of the mighty People's Public Security Forces escorted the two secret agents and spies to the execution ground. We cheered and rejoiced, and the American secret agents and spies could not lift their heads. Let them repay their sins with shameful dirty blood! Let all American imperialist secret agents and spies tremble! Let them hear our angry roar: "Down with American imperialism!" "Resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries!"

    (VI) Editor Comrades:

    The verdict of the Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission on the American secret agents and spies is fully in line with the demands and wishes of the people. The execution of the American secret agents is really a matter of great joy to the people.

    The Chinese people love their motherland and their leader Chairman Mao. We will never allow the claws of imperialism to reach into our country, and we will never allow any aggression from imperialism. Imperialist elements are plotting to assassinate the leaders of the Chinese people; however, in today's people's China, the vicious and shameless conspiracies of imperialism can never succeed. The bandits will never escape the people's dragnet.

    The confessions and actions of American secret agents and spies Li Andong and Yamaguchi Ryuichi once again tell us: the United States has become the homeland of fascist bandits, and has become the mortal enemy of the people all over the world. Li Andong was a loyal bandit of Fascist founder Mussolini, and Yamaguchi Ryuichi was also a fascist bandit with a long history, and now their new master is American imperialism. And American imperialism, like the Hitler bandits, will surely be destroyed in the people's righteous sea of fire.

    The Chinese people who have stood up must unite closely under the banner of Mao Zedong, strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, heighten vigilance, and smash all the conspiracies of imperialism!

    (VII) Editor Comrades:

    When I saw the news that the Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission sentenced the American secret agents and spies Li Andong and Yamaguchi Ryuichi to death for plotting an armed rebellion, I felt both happy and resentful. What makes me happy is that these imperialist elements have once again suffered a shameful defeat in the face of the powerful Chinese people. The cracking of this major case once again warns the imperialists: the Chinese people are inviolable, and we have the power to smash all the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism. What makes me resentful is that the American imperialist elements are really audacious and dare to plot to assassinate our most beloved leaders and the heads of the Central People's Government. Such vile and sinful behavior is intolerable to us. The Chinese people have already given these extremely sinful imperialist elements the punishment they deserve.

    From this case, the Chinese people have further recognized that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. They are scheming against our great motherland every day,妄想 to drag the Chinese people back to the semi-colonial era where American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek could arbitrarily slaughter us. This case explains an ironclad truth to the Chinese people: If we want to defend our great motherland, defend our free and happy life, and create a better future, we must resolutely fight against imperialism. All the Chinese people must learn the patriotism of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea and the comrades of the public security organs in the rear, and take practical actions to defend our great motherland, be vigilant and strike against any "challenges" of American imperialism to the Chinese people.

    In order to more effectively educate the people, I suggest that the public security department publicly display the materials of this case.

    Finally, I pay the highest respect to all the comrades of the Beijing Public Security Organs who guard Chairman Mao and our capital!

　　Leading Cadres of the State-owned Huangxun District Farm
    Should Broadly Absorb Workers' Opinions and Conscientiously Inspect and Improve Work

    Editor Comrades:

    I want to tell you about some situations in the administrative leadership of the state-owned Huangfan District Farm, such as arbitrarily dismissing workers and not paying attention to workers' opinions, so that you can help the factory urge them to pay attention to improvement.

    Nie Xingkuan was originally a driver in the factory, and later transferred to the repair shop as a mechanical custodian, and was a member of the Communist Youth League. The reason for his dismissal was this: a group of internship workers from the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization School came to the factory, and when they were about to leave, they raised some opinions on the administrative leadership of the farm. Nie Xingkuan reflected these opinions. Instead of studying these opinions and checking and improving the work, the factory's leadership dismissed Nie Xingkuan, who reflected the opinions, which is very wrong. Initially, the factory headquarters notified Nie Xingkuan to bring his luggage to the factory headquarters for reassignment. After Nie arrived at the factory headquarters, the leading comrades said again: "Your leg is not good, which hinders your work, now you go home." Nie Xingkuan's leg was injured during work, and he walked with a bit of a limp, which did not hinder the work too much, and it would be fine after a few days of rest (it has now been healed), so he was unwilling to go home. However, the factory's leadership insisted on their own opinions, and Nie Xingkuan had no choice but to go home. The workers were all very dissatisfied with this incident.

    The bureaucratic style of the factory's leadership is also quite serious. The workers often raise opinions, asking the factory's leadership to regularly go to the work areas to inspect the work, but they never go. Once, the Fifth Work Team sent a comrade from the Fugou County farming area to the factory headquarters (in Xihua County) to collect machine parts. When he arrived, he could not find the person in charge. He asked the factory director for a note, but the factory director told him to go to the repair shop. The repair shop told him to go to the finance section, but the warehouse director was not at home. The comrade from the Fifth Work Team ran around for three days, but the parts were still not received. This wastes manpower and delays work. When workers raise opinions at meetings, the leading comrades say, "The meeting is adjourned today, and we will meet again tomorrow." In short, they do not accept the correct opinions of the workers and do not solve the problems existing in the work and among the workers.

　　拥护人民政府严惩美国特务间谍
    向北京公安机关人员致敬
    编者按：自本报八月十八日刊载了北京市军事管制委员会军法处判决美国特务间谍阴谋武装暴动案的新闻后，到二十日为止，我们已收到六个团体和八十三位读者的来信五十一封。这些来信一致拥护政府的正确措施。除于十九日已刊登三封外，今天再选刊七封于后：
    （一）编辑同志：
    北京市军事管制委员会军法处判决美国特务间谍阴谋武装暴动案，我们万分拥护。
    这一案件引起了我们对美帝国主义的极端痛恨和愤怒。万恶的敌人企图杀害我们中国人民热爱的领袖，这是中国人民决不能容忍的！从这个卑鄙毒辣的阴谋里，我们更进一步地认识了中国人民不共戴天的凶恶敌人——美帝国主义的狰狞面貌。美帝国主义侵略中国一百多年，最后在中国人民面前终于遭到了可耻的失败。但帝国主义是不甘心它们的失败的。它们除了疯狂地发动侵略战争外，又阴谋在我国大陆上组织武装暴动。中国人民一定要抗美援朝，打败帝国主义的侵略；并要坚决镇压反革命，斩断帝国主义侵略中国的魔爪，绝不允许它们在我们解放了的自由神圣的国土上乱说乱动。
    这一案件的破获，是我们在无形战线上的重大胜利。因此，我们向破获案件的公安人员致敬！
    让帝国主义分子在我们站起来的中国人民面前发抖吧！看吧，这就是美国特务间谍的下场！
    这件事情深深地教育了我们，加强了我们对美帝国主义的仇恨，提高了我们的警惕。我们要为保卫我们的胜利，和内外反动派作严肃的坚决斗争。

      桂华珠  盛贵云  曹奉仁  马骥铮
    （二）编辑同志：
    读了北京市军事管制委员会军法处判决美国特务间谍阴谋武装暴动的消息，我增加了对帝国主义的痛恨。政府这一判决，是完全符合全中国人民利益的。同时警告了帝国主义者：伟大的中国人民是不可侵犯的！
    伟大的中国共产党领导着中国人民，经过三十年的艰苦奋斗，终于打垮了国内的反动统治，驱逐了帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，取得了今天的伟大胜利。可是，帝国主义是不甘心它们的失败的。万恶的美国特务间谍李安东等，就在它们主子的指使下，在我国搜集情报，策划武装暴动。它们竟妄想在去年国庆节炮轰天安门，谋杀我人民领袖。这种罪恶行动是我们中国人民决不能容忍的！这个案件使中国人民更清楚地认识：美帝国主义是中国人民不共戴天的死敌！中国人民将继续提高警惕，坚决镇压一切反革命分子，并加强抗美援朝运动，给美帝国主义以更大的打击！
      中国人民解放军装甲兵某部  吴刚基
    （三）编辑同志：
    我们是少数民族的青年。在过去，我们少数民族人民和汉族同胞一样，受到帝国主义的蹂躏与迫害。它们给我们的灾难是数不清的。我们深深记得这个仇恨！
    人民政府判决了美国特务间谍阴谋暴动案，枪决了美国间谍李安东和山口隆一。这个正确的措施，完全符合于人民的愿望。这说明：站起来了的中国人民是神圣不可侵犯的。假如任何帝国主义分子敢来破坏我们祖国，我们一定能够彻底消灭它！
    我们坚决拥护政府这个英明的措施。今后并更要提高警惕，防止特务分子的活动。

    美国特务间谍李安东、山口隆一，被北京市军事管制委员会军法处判处死刑了。政府这种处理是完全正确的。从匪徒李安东、山口隆一等的阴谋中，我们可以深刻的看到美帝国主义是蓄意与中国人民为敌的。但是，无论它是如何阴险毒辣，中国人民是完全有力量粉碎它的阴谋的。李安东、山口隆一两个罪犯可耻的下场，正代表了所有侵略者的必然下场。中国人民一定要提高警惕，继续和国内外反动派斗争，坚决镇压反革命，巩固我们的胜利。

    （五）编辑同志：
    十七日下午我们在王府井大街两旁，亲眼看到两名外藉特务间谍被押赴刑场，我们感到痛快万分！
    在过去一百多年来的反动统治者的媚外政策下，帝国主义分子在中国耀武扬威，任意鱼肉中国人民。只有在今天，在人民民主专政的今天，中国人民才真正扬眉吐气了。我们的政府坚决镇压反革命，这完全代表中国人民的意志。任何帝国主义分子敢来危害我们的革命事业，它们就不能逃脱人民的严厉制裁！
    威武的人民公安部队的战士，将两名特务间谍押赴刑场。我们鼓舞欢呼，美国特务间谍分子抬不起头来。让他们用可耻的污血偿还他们的罪孽吧！让一切美帝国主义的特务间谍浑身发抖吧！让他们听到我们的愤怒的吼声：“打倒美帝国主义！”“坚决镇压反革命！”

    （六）编辑同志：
    北京市军事管理委员会军法处对于美国特务间谍的判决是完全符合人民的要求和愿望的。美国特务的伏法真是一件大快人心的事情。
    中国人民热爱自己的祖国和自己的领袖毛主席。我们绝不容许帝国主义的魔爪伸到我们的国度里来，我们绝不容许帝国主义的任何侵犯。帝国主义分子阴谋杀害中国人民的领袖；但是，在今天人民的中国，帝国主义毒辣无耻的阴谋是决不能得逞的。匪徒们决逃不脱人民的天罗地网。
    美国特务间谍李安东与山口隆一的口供和行为又一次告诉我们：美国已成为法西斯匪徒们的祖国，已成为全世界人民的死敌。李安东是法西斯创始人墨索里尼的忠实匪徒，山口隆一也是一个有很长历史的法西斯匪徒，现在他们的新主子就是美帝国主义。而美帝国主义，正像希特勒匪徒们一样，必将毁灭在人民的正义的火海里。
    站起来了的中国人民一定要紧紧团结在毛泽东的旗帜之下，加强抗美援朝工作，坚决镇压反革命，提高警惕，粉碎帝国主义的一切阴谋！
        中国人民大学  徐京安
    （七）编辑同志：
    我看到北京市军事管制委员会军法处判决阴谋武装暴动的美国特务间谍分子李安东、山口隆一死刑的消息时，心中又高兴又愤恨。使我高兴的是：这些帝国主义分子在强大的中国人民面前又一次遭到可耻的失败。这一重大案件的破获，再一次警告了帝国主义者：中国人民是不可侵犯的，我们有力量粉碎帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计。使我愤恨的是：美帝国主义分子真是胆大包天，竟敢阴谋刺杀我们最亲爱的领袖和中央人民政府各位首长。这种卑劣的罪恶行为是我们不能容忍的。中国人民已经给这些罪大恶极的帝国主义分子以应得的惩处。
    中国人民从这个案件中进一步认识了美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌。他们天天都在暗算我们伟大的祖国，妄想把中国人民仍旧拖回可以让美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石任意宰割的半殖民地时代。这个案件向中国人民说明一个铁的道理：要想保卫我们伟大祖国，保卫我们自由幸福生活，并创造更美好的将来，我们必须坚决和帝国主义作斗争。全中国人民都要学习在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军和后方公安机关同志们的爱国主义精神，以实际行动保卫我们伟大的祖国，警惕和打击美帝国主义对中国人民的任何“挑战”。
    为了更有效地教育人民，我建议公安部门将这个案件的材料公开展览。
    最后，敬向警卫着毛主席和我们首都的北京公安机关全体同志致最崇高的敬礼！

　　国营黄讯区农场领导干部
    应广泛吸收工人意见  切实检查并改进工作
    编辑同志：
    我想告诉你们关于国营黄泛区农场行政领导方面有随便开除工人，不重视工人意见的一些情况，以便你们帮助该厂促使他们注意改进。
    聂兴宽原是该场驾驶员，后又调到修配厂当机械保管员，是个青年团员。他被开除的原因是这样的：北京机耕学校曾来了一批实习工人，这批工人临走时，对农场行政领导上提了一些意见。聂兴宽反映了这些意见。该厂领导上不是研究这些意见，检查改进工作，而是开除了反映意见的聂兴宽，这是非常错误的。最初，该场场本部通知聂兴宽携带行李到场本部另行分配工作。聂到场本部以后，领导同志又说：“你的腿不好，对工作有妨碍，现在你回家吧。”聂兴宽的腿是工作中碰伤的，走路有些跛，并不太妨碍工作，而且只要休养几天就会好的（现在已经养好了），因此他不愿回家。但该场领导上坚持自己的意见，聂兴宽无法，只得回家。工人们对这件事都很不满意。
    该场领导方面的官僚主义作风也是相当严重的。工人们常常提意见，要场的领导方面经常到各工作区检查工作，但是他们总是不去。有一次第五工作队派一个同志从扶沟县耕作区到场部（在西华县）去领机器零件，到时找不到负责人，找场长开条子，场长叫找修配厂，修配厂又叫找财务股，结果仓库主任又不在家。第五工作队这个同志，一直跑了三天，东西还没有领到。这样既浪费人力，又耽误工作。开会时，工人提意见，领导同志就说，“今天散会，明天再开。”总之是不接受工人的正确意见，不解决工作中以及工人中存在的问题。
