　　Profound Friendship Between Chinese and German Youth
    My Youth Delegation Received Many Gifts from German Youth
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 18th] During the World Youth Festival, the Chinese Youth Delegation received hundreds of gifts from youth throughout Germany. Every day, youth and workers from schools, factories, and organizations in the German Democratic Republic bring various meticulously crafted items to the residence of the Chinese Youth Delegation. In addition to flags, pictures, and books, the gifts also include various machine models, instruments, parts, carvings, porcelain, and glassware. On the morning of August 18th, workers from the Bavarian Motor Works personally drove a brand-new ambulance to pay their respects to the Chinese youth and donated the vehicle to the Chinese People's Volunteers. The world-renowned Zeiss Ikon factory sent a set of astronomical instruments to the Chinese Youth Delegation. The factory had manufactured two sets of astronomical instruments before Stalin's 70th birthday; one set was presented to Stalin as a birthday gift, and the other had been stored until now and was given to the Chinese youth to express the deep friendship of the German youth for the victorious Chinese youth and people.
    In addition: Xiao San, member of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council and Chinese poet, arrived here yesterday by train from Prague. The International Committee of the Festival invited him to participate in the closing ceremony of the festival as an honorary guest.
