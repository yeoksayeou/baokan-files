Tangshan Yongxingzhai Shoe Store Manager Abuses Apprentices
    Local Government Should Immediately Investigate and Deal With It
    To the Editor:
    Li Wanchuan, manager of the Tangshan Yongxingzhai Shoe Store, still uses barbaric methods from the feudal society to treat apprentices. Li Wanchuan's illegal behavior should be sanctioned by the people's law.
    After Shi Yongcun became an apprentice at the Yongxingzhai Shoe Store in 1949, Li Wanchuan did not teach him any skills but instead told him to pick coal at Pengzi Mountain and cook and do chores. Later, he asked him to mend worn-out shoes in front of the store. Shi Yongcun got up at five o'clock every morning and could not sleep until eleven o'clock at the earliest. Sometimes, because of the heavy workload, he had to work until three o'clock in the morning. Because of such long working hours without rest, he often suffered from sore back and legs.
    Shi Yongcun worked very hard at mending worn-out shoes, and he could do more than 20,000 yuan worth of business every day, but in the nearly two years that he had been at Yongxingzhai, he had only received 20,000 yuan and a few tattered clothes. In the winter, his hands and feet were chapped from working outside. He became ill in the first month of this year, and no one cared about him. Because of such severe abuse, his health is very poor.
    Li Wanchuan also prevented Shi Yongcun from joining the trade union, saying, "Even if I don't let you join, it won't kill you!" Since October 1949, Li Wanchuan has beaten Shi Yongcun six times. The most recent beating injured Shi Yongcun's eye. After the trade union learned of this, it reported the matter to the Public Security Bureau, which gave Li Wanchuan a warning and provided Shi Yongcun with medicine to treat his eyes. After Shi Yongcun returned to the store, Li Wanchuan's daughter scolded him and tore off the medicated cloth that had just been applied to Shi Yongcun's eyes. On one occasion, Shi Yongcun was beaten after returning to the store after enlisting in the army (he was not approved because he was too small), and Li Wanchuan even said, "Your mother and your brother were both killed as Eighth Route Army soldiers (they were killed by landlords), and you still want to be a soldier!" When Li Wanchuan abused his apprentice, his daughter, son-in-law, and wife often helped him. We hope that the local people's government will promptly investigate and sanction Li Wanchuan's serious violation of human rights and abuse of apprentices.

### 唐山永兴斋鞋店经理虐待学徒  当地政府应即予以调查处理

　　唐山永兴斋鞋店经理虐待学徒
    当地政府应即予以调查处理
    编辑同志：
    唐山永兴斋鞋店经理李万川，仍然采取了封建社会野蛮残暴的办法对待学徒。李万川这种违法行为应该受到人民法律的制裁。
    该店学徒史永存一九四九年到永兴斋鞋店当学徒后，李万川并不教给他技术而叫他去到砰子山拾煤，作饭打杂，后来又叫他在门前缝补破鞋。史永存每天早上五点起床，最早也要到晚上十一点才能睡觉，有时因为活忙，就要干到夜间三点多。因为这样长的工作时间没有休息，所以常常累得腰酸腿痛。
    史永存缝破鞋很用心，每天可以做两万多块钱的生意，但是他到永兴斋将近二年了，一共只拿到两万元和几件破烂不堪的衣服。冬天在门外做活，手脚都冻裂了口子。今年正月得了一场病，也没人过问。因为受到这样严重的摧残，所以他的身体很坏。
    李万川并阻止史永存加入工会，说：“就是不叫你入会，这也死不了人！”自一九四九年十月以来，李万川曾六次毒打史永存。最近一次毒打，竟把史永存的眼打伤了，工会知道了这件事，曾报由公安局派出所给李万川以警告，并给史永存上药治眼睛。史永存回店以后，李万川的女儿竟大骂，并将刚给史永存眼睛敷上的药布撕掉。有一次史永存因报名要求参军（身体太小没有被批准）回店后受到毒打，李万川还说：“你妈、你哥都是当八路军被杀死的（是被地主杀死的），你还要去当兵！”在李万川虐待学徒的时候，他的女儿、女婿和老婆常常是帮凶。我们希望当地人民政府对李万川这样严重的侵犯人权、虐待学徒的行为，迅速予以调查并给予制裁。
