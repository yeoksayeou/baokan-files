(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Warsaw - The Supreme Military Tribunal in Warsaw began on July 31st the trial of the leading members of a spy and sabotage organization operating within the Polish army. The activities of this criminal organization were directed and financed by the imperialist central intelligence agencies in Washington and London. The defendants in the case include: General Tatzar, former chief of the Operations Department of the National Army (referring to the Polish fascist underground organization during World War II), and later deputy minister of the so-called "London Headquarters" headed by Kopanski; Colonel Utnik, chief of the Sixth Department (sabotage department) of the "London Headquarters"; Colonel Novitsky, an intelligence officer of the deputy minister of the "London Headquarters"; General Guilman, former deputy chief of the Second Department of the National Army Headquarters; General Krzemier; General Moser; Colonel Julitzky; Major Roman; and Third Lieutenant Vasek.

The indictment in the case stated that all of these defendants were originally officers of the old Poland. From 1945 to 1950, under the command of imperialist countries and their intelligence agencies, they engaged in criminal espionage and sabotage activities within the Polish army. The defendants intended to have the imperialists carve off Poland's western territories and incorporate these lands into a new Hitlerite Germany, and turn the rest of Poland into a colony of the imperialists. However, because our army is the people's army and a reliable pillar of the Polish state power, the criminals' activities encountered many difficulties.

The indictment continued: The defendants' criminal espionage and sabotage activities were inseparable from the Polish bourgeoisie's traitorous policies. In 1939, the Polish bourgeoisie abandoned the Polish people to the fascist invaders, and then, under the instigation and assistance of Anglo-American imperialism, colluded with the Hitlerite occupation forces to oppose the Polish national liberation movement. After most of Polish territory was liberated by the Soviet army, the Polish Committee of National Liberation was established in the liberated areas of Poland. The Polish people rose with great enthusiasm to fight alongside the Soviet army against the invaders. In order to oppose the genuine liberation of the Polish people, the London exile group secretly instructed the launching of the Warsaw Uprising. This uprising caused terrible disasters for the Polish people, and countless people sacrificed their lives. After the failure of the uprising and other sabotage activities, the London exile group prepared in advance a large-scale plan to oppose the people's government and the Soviet army.

In February 1944, the Polish exiled "government" in London, on the advice of Sosnkowski, decided to establish illegal military and civil institutions to carry out hostile activities against the people's government, the Polish army, and the Soviet army that liberated Poland. Later, even more detailed instructions were drafted according to a "Nee" plan for sabotage and espionage.

Defendant Tatzar, the chief of the Operations Department of the National Army Headquarters, and his confidant, defendant Krzemier, were engaged in formulating detailed plans from 1943 to 1944. At that time, they decided to let Krzemier join the Polish army after Poland's liberation, plotting to seize control of the army.

In April 1944, defendant Tatzar flew from Poland to London on a special plane. In June of the same year, he and Mikolajczyk together told senior representatives of the American imperialist group and Churchill about their plan to oppose People's Poland. This plan was agreed upon by Churchill and the Americans, and in the second half of July 1944, the Americans provided ten million US dollars as funding for the implementation of this plan.

The British government at that time was bound by a military alliance with the Soviet Union and was very worried that its support for these sabotage activities in the Soviet and Polish armies would be exposed. Therefore, British Foreign Secretary Eden told Polish Ambassador Rachinski and defendant Tatzar through Lieutenant Colonel Perkins on January 16, 1945, that the British government agreed to maintain contact with Poland, but this activity must be carried out in secret. For this purpose, the Polish exiled headquarters in London specially organized a secret guidance center "Hell," which was funded, directed, and controlled by the British intelligence agency, and the British representative was Lieutenant Colonel Perkins. In May 1945, the various central stations of the spy and sabotage organization engaged in conspiracy activities in European countries were all placed under the jurisdiction of "Hell." These central stations secretly sent agents, spies, and secret agents to Poland, and also sent large sums of money to support underground criminal activities. In 1945, the leading organs of "Hell" and some organizations engaged in sabotage activities in Polish state institutions and the army established contact. One of those organizations was the sabotage center established by defendants Krzemier, Guilman, and Gurobska.

After the attempt to seize power by force, incited by the United States and Britain, suffered a major failure, Mikolajczyk returned to Poland to carry out activities. Various reactionary groups gave Mikolajczyk various support. They attempted to undermine the people's trust in the people's government by means of assassination and sabotage, and to create the necessary conditions for Mikolajczyk to win the election. The "Hell" leadership sent a special group, including Tatzar, Utnik, and Novitsky. They paid special attention to activities in the army, because gaining control of the army would give Mikolajczyk a powerful trump card.

The funds for these sabotage activities carried out by the defendants were paid from the ten million US dollars received from the American government. This money was not only brought to Poland by the agents of the sabotage organization themselves, but also by the head of the American diplomatic mission, Hankey. The British and French embassies in Poland often relayed intelligence for this spy and sabotage organization. The imperialists tried their best to pave the way for Mikolajczyk to come to power, they spied for information, carried out sabotage activities, funded and commanded armed bandits, and opposed People's Poland, but Mikolajczyk's conspiracy activities finally suffered a shameful failure.

The defendants had hoped to obtain support from right-wing elements of the Polish Socialist Party and other parties, mainly the right-wing nationalist group within the Polish Workers' Party. Based on this, the leading members of this criminal group strengthened their connection with the former Deputy Minister of National Defense, Spychalski. Krzemier, Guilman, Moser, Gurobska and others were all assigned by Spychalski to important positions in the central institutions of the Polish army. Spychalski also used deception to get the above-mentioned defendants to receive general-level ranks. As a result of the Polish Workers' Party clearing the right-wing nationalist group in the leadership in 1948, the hopes that this criminal spy sabotage organization had placed on those right-wing nationalist groups completely fell through. This situation forced it to change its original strategy and formulate new methods of activity. At this stage, its activities focused on espionage. However, it did not give up opportunities for political sabotage. In the autumn of 1949, defendants Tatzar, Utnik, and Novitsky returned to Poland with new orders from London. The instructions ordered them to continue espionage and sabotage activities against the Polish and Soviet armies, and to strengthen ties with the British and American embassies for espionage activities. These new orders constituted the basis for further criminal activities that continued until the defendants were arrested.

The indictment concluded: The spy sabotage organization of Tatzar and his accomplices was an agency of Anglo-American intelligence agencies. It caused great damage to Poland. When Spychalski was active in the Polish army, the defendants extensively used his assistance and support, causing significant losses to the armed forces of the people's state. Their political conspiracy was to establish a fascist regime completely subservient to Anglo-American imperialists, the same as Yugoslavia. They calculated the possibility of a special form of Titoism succeeding in Poland. Their sinister plans have been exposed. Their criminal activities against the Polish people and their armed forces have been curbed. The traitors have been brought to trial.

　　波兰审讯在波军中进行破坏的美英间谍
    严厉打击了英美帝国主义间谍机关的罪恶计划
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：华沙最高军事法庭于七月三十一日起开始审讯在波兰军队中进行活动的间谍与破坏组织的首要分子。这个犯罪组织的活动是受华盛顿和伦敦的帝国主义中央情报机关的指导和资助的。本案被告有：塔达尔准将，是前国家军（按系第二次大战中波兰法西斯地下组织）总部行动处处长，后为以科潘斯基为首的所谓“伦敦总部”的副部长；乌德尼克上校，是“伦敦总部”第六处（阴谋破坏处）处长；诺维茨基上校，是“伦敦总部”副部长的特务官；吉尔曼准将，是前国家军总部第二处副处长；克赤迈尔准将；摩塞将军；朱利茨基上校；罗曼少校；瓦塞克三级上尉。
    本案的起诉书指出：所有这些被告原来都是旧波兰的军官。在一九四五年到一九五○年期间，他们在帝国主义国家及其情报机关的指挥下，在波兰军队中进行犯罪的间谍和阴谋破坏活动。被告等打算使帝国主义割去波兰的西部领土，把这些土地并入一个新的希特勒式的德国，并把其余的波兰领土变成帝国主义者的殖民地。但是，由于我国军队是人民的军队，是波兰国家政权的可靠的支柱，所以罪犯们的这种活动遭遇到许多困难。
    起诉书接着指出：被告等的犯罪的间谍和阴谋破坏活动，是和波兰资产阶级的卖国政策分不开的。波兰资产阶级在一九三九年把波兰人民委弃给法西斯侵略者，接着就在英美帝国主义的煽动与帮助下，勾结希特勒占领军，反对波兰的民族解放运动。波兰领土大部被苏军解放后，波兰的解放区成立了波兰民族解放委员会。波兰人民以巨大的热情奋起与苏军并肩对侵略者进行斗争。为了反对波兰人民的真正解放，伦敦流亡集团暗地指示发动华沙暴动。这次暴动使波兰人民遭到了可怕的灾难，无数人牺牲了性命。在暴动及其他阴谋破坏活动遭受失败后，伦敦流亡集团事先准备了此后的大规模反对人民政权和苏军的计划。
    一九四四年二月，在伦敦的波兰流亡“政府”根据索森考斯基的建议，决定成立非法的军事和民政机构，对人民政权、波兰军队及解放波兰的苏军进行敌对活动。以后，又根据一个进行阴谋破坏和间谍活动的“尼耶”计划草拟出更为详尽的指示。
    被告国家军总部行动处处长塔达尔和他的心腹、被告克赤迈尔，在一九四三年到一九四四年间从事制订详尽计划。那时他们决定让克赤迈尔在波兰解放之后参加波兰军队，阴谋夺取军队的控制权。
    一九四四年四月，被告塔达尔乘专机从波兰飞往伦敦。同年六月，他和米柯拉兹科一道，把他们反对人民波兰的计划告诉美帝国主义集团的高级代表和邱吉尔。这个计划得到邱吉尔和美国人的同意，就在一九四四年七月下半月，美国人拿出了一千万美元供作为实现这个计划的经费。
    英国政府当时受着与苏联军事同盟的约束，很担心它对这些在苏军和波军中的阴谋破坏活动的支持会被揭穿。因此，英国外交大臣艾登在一九四五年一月十六日通过柏金斯中校告诉波兰大使拉勤斯基和被告塔达尔说，英国政府同意和波兰国内保持联系，但这种活动必须秘密地进行。为此目的，伦敦的波兰流亡总部特别组织了一个秘密的指导中心“赫尔”，这个机构受英国谍报机关的资助、指导和控制，英国方面的代表是柏金斯中校。一九四五年五月，在欧洲各国进行阴谋活动的该间谍与破坏组织的各中心站，都交由“赫尔”来管辖。这些中心站秘密派遣特务、奸细和间谍到波兰来，也送大批款项支持地下的犯罪活动。一九四五年“赫尔”的领导机关和一些在波兰国家机构及军队中进行阴谋破坏活动的组织建立了联系。那些组织中有一个是由被告克赤迈尔、吉尔曼和古罗柏斯加所建立的阴谋破坏中心站。
    在英美两国鼓动用武力夺取政权的企图遭受到大失败之后，米柯拉兹科回到波兰进行活动。各反动团体给米柯拉兹科以各种支援。他们企图用暗杀与阴谋破坏的办法来破坏人民大众对人民政权的信任，并为米柯拉兹科在选举中获得胜利创造必要的条件。“赫尔”领导机构派遣了特别小组，组员中就有塔达尔、乌德尼克和诺维茨基。他们特别注重在军队方面的活动，因为夺得军队就会使米柯拉兹科得到强有力的王牌。
    被告等进行这些破坏活动的经费，是由从美国政府领到的一千万美元中支付的。这些钱不仅由该阴谋破坏组织的特务自己带到波兰来，美国的外交官汉基处长也曾给他们带钱到波兰来。英法两国的驻波兰大使馆则经常为这个间谍破坏组织传递谍报。帝国主义者竭力想为米柯拉兹科铺平上台执政的道路，他们刺探情报，进行破坏活动，资助并指挥武装匪徒，反对人民波兰，但米柯拉兹科的阴谋活动终于遭到可耻的失败。
    被告等曾期望从波兰社会党和其他政党的右翼分子，主要是波兰工人党内的右翼民族主义集团获得支援。根据这一点，这一个罪犯集团的首要分子就加强他们和前国防部副部长斯培查尔斯基的联系。克赤迈尔、吉尔曼、摩塞和古罗柏斯加等，都由斯培查尔斯基派在波兰军中央机构中担任重要职务。斯培查尔斯基并利用欺骗手段使上述各被告得到将级的官阶。由于一九四八年波兰工人党清除领导机构中的右翼民族主义集团，结果这一罪恶的间谍破坏组织所寄托在那些右翼民族主义集团上面的希望便完全落空了。这种情况迫使它改变原有策略，拟定新的活动方法。在这一阶段，它的活动便集中于间谍工作。然而它并不放弃进行政治破坏的机会。一九四九年秋天，被告塔达尔、乌德尼克、诺维茨基携带着伦敦的新命令回到波兰。该指示命令他们继续对波兰军和苏军进行间谍破坏活动，并加强和英美大使馆的联系，以进行间谍活动。这些新命令便构成了后来一直延续到被告等被捕之日为止的进一步罪恶活动的基础。
    起诉书最后说：塔达尔及其同谋犯的间谍破坏组织，就是英美情报机关的一个代理机构。它使波兰蒙受很大的损害。当斯培查尔斯基在波兰军中活动的时候，被告们曾广泛利用他的援助和支持，使人民国家的武装部队遭到了重大的损失。他们的政治阴谋是想建立一个和南斯拉夫相同的完全臣服于英美帝国主义者的法西斯政权。他们盘算特种形式的铁托主义在波兰获胜的可能性。他们的罪恶计划已被揭露了。他们反对波兰人民及其武装部队的罪恶活动已被遏止了。卖国贼们已经交付审判。
