    Reader's Letters
    In-depth Study of Chairman Mao's "On Practice"
    Editor:
    Since the publication of Chairman Mao's great work "On Practice," cadres in various departments of our country and the academic community have conducted preliminary studies and research on "On Practice," and some articles on learning experiences have appeared in newspapers and magazines. However, on the whole, we have done poorly in this area. The national cultural and ideological circles have not given sufficient importance to this classic work by Chairman Mao.
    The publication of "On Practice" is a major event for the Chinese people. As the People's Daily editorial pointed out on January 29, "Comrade Mao Zedong's 'On Practice' has fulfilled a critical and revolutionary task in ideology, which is not limited to having great significance for our Party, but also has great significance for all the people of our country." Because this work "is the crystallization of the Chinese working class's long-term struggle in thought, a completely new revolution in Chinese philosophy." "Its significance is universal and permanent. It is equally important to Marxists-Leninists in all countries of the world and is a great contribution." "The re-publication of this work itself is a major event in the Marxist theoretical circle and should lead to a new theoretical upsurge in China."
    However, for such an important work, although our cultural and academic circles have held many symposiums and discussions, and published some explanatory articles, the actual achievements are still not satisfactory. Some people only regard the study of "On Practice" as a timely task and feel that continuing to do so now seems somewhat "outdated"; others simply repeat and explain the words and sentences in "On Practice" on paper. This shows that many comrades still do not understand the significance and value of "On Practice," nor do they understand the guiding significance of "On Practice" for us.
    The "People's Education" Volume 3, Issue 3, formulated a research scope and organized an "On Practice" essay contest, and in Volume 3, Issue 4, called on educators to combine the study of "On Practice" with the current educational construction work. I think this is a good thing. I hope that other cultural and scientific departments can also carry out the study of "On Practice" more widely and deeply to improve our work.

    Learning Chairman Mao's Method of Observing Things and the Style of Contacting the Masses
    Editor:
    Studying Chairman Mao's "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" and "Pay Attention to Economic Problems" has given me a deeper understanding that Chairman Mao is a master of correctly grasping the Marxist-Leninist method of observation and analysis, and is a model of a revolutionary optimist who has always had a strong belief in the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause.
    First, in "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," published in 1930, Chairman Mao made a brilliant analysis of the political situation in China at that time: "Although the subjective forces of the Chinese revolution are weak now, all the organizations of the reactionary ruling classes (political power, armed forces, parties, etc.) based on China's backward and fragile socio-economic organization are also weak." Therefore, he drew the genius conclusion for the revolutionary subjective forces that were "weak" at that time: "...it not only possesses the possibility of development in the Chinese environment, but simply possesses the inevitability of development..." After 1930, the subjective forces of the Chinese revolution developed day by day until they became an invincible and powerful force to seize power. This fact proves the complete correctness of this conclusion and highlights Chairman Mao's genius foresight.
    Secondly, in the article "Pay Attention to Economic Problems," Chairman Mao said: "Comrades, what is the real bastion of iron? It is the masses, the millions of people who wholeheartedly support the revolution. This is the real bastion of iron, which no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries. Unite millions of people around the revolutionary government, develop our revolutionary war, and we can eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, we can seize the whole of China." This is a voice of contempt for the enemy and a firm belief that our revolutionary cause will surely win.
    From these historical documents of Chairman Mao, I feel more deeply that as a revolutionary, we must be good at grasping rich materials for meticulous scientific analysis, that is, we must grasp the essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, otherwise we will make mistakes. Also, in our work, we must rely on the masses and develop a work style of contacting and trusting the masses. Otherwise, we will accomplish nothing. We should also learn Chairman Mao's revolutionary optimistic attitude, and even if the environment is difficult, we must have the confidence to overcome difficulties.
                  A Reader

    Learning Chairman Mao's Method of Class Analysis
    Editor:
    On August 3rd, I made a study plan, an important part of which is to carefully study Chairman Mao's great works published successively in the People's Daily, to further understand the history of our Party's struggle over the past 30 years, to strengthen my position, and to better exert my strength in the construction of the motherland's national defense.
    After reading several articles, I realized that each of Chairman Mao's works was written to solve specific problems in each historical period, and I also clarified the truth that "Marxism-Leninism is not a dogma but a guide to action"; and I learned that the reason why the Chinese revolution was able to overcome erroneous ideological tendencies at every dangerous and critical moment, and enable the Party to maintain a clear mind in a complex and dangerous environment, and finally win today's brilliant victory, is inseparable from Chairman Mao's many works.
    For example, after the CPC Wayaobao Conference in 1935, in his article "On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism," Chairman Mao analyzed the attitude of the national bourgeoisie when facing a major enemy: "We believe that under the new environment of colonial threat, the attitude of these sections of the national bourgeoisie may change. The characteristic of this change is their vacillation.... What is the difference between the current period and the period of Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution in 1927? At that time, China was still a semi-colony. Now, it is moving towards a colony. For nine years, they have abandoned their ally, the working class... what they have gained is only the bankruptcy or semi-bankruptcy of national industry and commerce. Because of these circumstances, we believe that the attitude of the national bourgeoisie has the possibility of change in the current situation." That is to say, the national bourgeoisie had the possibility of participating in the anti-Japanese war at this time. Chairman Mao also cited Cai Tingkai, who represented the interests of the national bourgeoisie, as an example. He had fought a deadly battle against the Red Army, and later signed an anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang alliance with the Red Army, which proved the reason why the national bourgeoisie could participate in the revolution at that time.
    From the above conclusions of Chairman Mao, we can see that Chairman Mao not only brilliantly analyzed the class essence of the national bourgeoisie, but also grasped the possibility of the national bourgeoisie participating in the revolution under new historical conditions, and criticized the mistake of some comrades in the Party who denied that the national bourgeoisie could participate in the revolution, making them realize the importance of establishing a broad anti-Japanese national united front. Therefore, if we want to learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and be a true Marxist, we must first learn such a method of class analysis and grasp the changing new conditions to carry out our revolutionary work.

    Coal Industry Building Materials Company Beijing Branch
    Entrusting a Large Number of Good Timber to Private Merchants for Sale
    But Failing to Supply the Needs of Basic Construction
    Editor:
    On August 17, the State Council issued instructions on saving timber, and at the same time established a timber inspection team to start inspections. In addition to wholeheartedly supporting and earnestly implementing these instructions, I would like to offer some opinions on the supply of timber by the Beijing Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, and ask the timber inspection team to consider them.
    When the Housing Overall Allocation Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government assigned engineering tasks this year, it stipulated that all timber should be supplied by the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company. However, the quality of the timber sold by the Beijing Branch of the company was very poor, only 40% was usable, and none of it could be used as scaffolding material. In order to ensure the quality of basic construction projects, we had to purchase good timber from Beijing Yongmao Construction Company and Hebei Public Security Cadre School at prices higher than the listed price (which has been published in the reader's letter column of the People's Daily on the 18th of this month). This caused direct losses to our company, and the property of the state and the people was also damaged. Therefore, we suspect: why does the Beijing Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company not have good timber, while the Hebei Public Security Cadre School sells good timber? I hope the timber inspection team will quickly check and deal with this.
    At the same time, we initially believed that the Beijing Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company could supply timber for basic construction. However, the timber sold by the company was all bad timber. In order to ensure the quality of the project, we requested to be sold good timber. The comrades of the company said: "This is the timber, if you don't want this, there is nothing else." However, later when we were looking for timber in the market, we found a large number of good timber from the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company in the private "Deji Trading Firm", which was said to be sold on behalf of the company, and the price was very high. For example, in the first half of June this year, 1,000 cubic meters of timber were sold to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. At that time, the highest listed price of the materials company was 1.8 million yuan per cubic meter, while the price sold by the "Deji Trading Firm" was 2.2 million yuan per cubic meter. Therefore, we suspect again: why does the Beijing Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company put good timber in the private "Deji Trading Firm" for high-priced sales, and put bad timber in the company and say "there is nothing else"? Is this violating government laws and regulations? I also hope the inspection team will quickly check this.

    Fuyang Public Hongxing Printing Factory
    Should Not Seize Illegal Profits
    Editor:
    The Hongxing Printing Factory in Fuyang, Northern Anhui (led by the Fuyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office), was established in May this year. The factory had not yet completed all its tools and equipment, so it rashly undertook to print the summer grain collection tickets of 79 reams of paper for each county on behalf of the prefectural commissioner's office. However, the collection tickets are time-sensitive. Since the Hongxing Printing Factory had no production capacity at that time, it had to transfer the production to private printing factories. In this way, between the transfer, the Hongxing Printing Factory actually asked each private merchant to extract one-half of the net profit from this production. The private households felt that the profit from printing the collection tickets was not large to begin with, and if half of it was extracted, it would be too uneconomical. Therefore, after another negotiation, it was decided to extract only one-third of the net profit for the Hongxing Printing Factory. In this way, the Hongxing Printing Factory distributed the production of the collection tickets of 79 reams of paper it had received to five private printing factories for printing. Between the receipt and distribution, the Hongxing Printing Factory actually obtained one-third of the net profit without paying a penny of cost. This matter, on the surface, was agreed upon by the private merchants, but behind the scenes, the private merchants were still very dissatisfied.
    I think it is wrong for the Hongxing Printing Factory to use its public position to obtain illegal profits. Therefore, I hope the relevant parties will conduct inspections and research.
                Dai Xianwu
    Editor's Note: Since the Fuyang Public Hongxing Printing Factory is a production unit, it should obtain legitimate profits from production to develop the factory. It is obviously wrong for the factory to contract the government's orders and then subcontract them to private merchants to make profits. We believe that the local government that ordered the collection tickets is actually suffering losses from this. In this regard, we hope the local government will conduct inspections and corrections.

    深入学习毛主席的《实践论》编辑同志：
    自从毛主席的伟大著作《实践论》发表以来，我们国家各部门的工作干部和学术界虽然已对《实践论》进行了初步的学习和研究，报章杂志上也出现了一些关于《实践论》的学习心得的文章，但整个说来，我们在这一方面还是做得很差的。全国文化思想界对毛主席这一经典的著作还没有予以足够的重视。
    《实践论》的发表对于中国人民说来是一件大事。正如一月二十九日人民日报社论所指出的：“毛泽东同志的‘实践论’，在思想上所履行的批判的革命的任务，不限在对于我们党有极伟大的意义，同时是对于我们全国人民有极伟大的意义。”因为这部著作“是中国工人阶级长期战斗在思想上的结晶品，是中国哲学界一个全新的革命。”“它的意义乃是普遍性的，永久性的。它对于世界各国的马克思列宁主义者来说，同样地是有很重要的意义的，是一个伟大的贡献。”“这个著作本身的重新发表，就是马克思主义理论界的一件大事，应该引出中国的一个理论新高潮。”
    但是，对于一篇这样重要的著作，我们的文化界学术界虽然开了许多座谈会、讨论会，发表了一些阐述的文章，但实际成绩还是不能令人满意的。有人只把学习《实践论》当作一件应时的工作，感到现在再继续做，似乎有些“过时”了；也有人只是在纸面上把《实践论》中的字句重复叙述一下，解说一下。这说明了不少同志还不了解《实践论》的意义和价值，不了解《实践论》对我们的指导意义。
    《人民教育》三卷三期曾拟定了一个研究范围，举办《实践论》征文，又在三卷四期上号召教育工作者把《实践论》的学习和当前的教育建设工作结合起来。我觉得这样做是很好的。我希望其他的文化科学部门也能更广泛更深入地展开《实践论》学习，以改进我们的工作。

    学习毛主席观察事物的方法与联系群众的作风编辑同志：
    我学习了毛主席的《星星之火，可以燎原》《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这两个文件，使我更深刻体会到毛主席是正确掌握马克思列宁主义的观察分析方法的能手，是对中国人民革命事业从来就有着坚强的胜利信心的革命乐观主义者的典范。
    第一，一九三○年发表的《星星之火，可以燎原》，毛主席对当时中国的政治形势，作了英明的分析《现在中国革命的主观力量虽然弱，但是立足于中国落后的脆弱的社会经济组织之上的反动统治阶级的一切组织（政权、武装、党派等）也是弱的”。从而得出对于在当时“虽然弱”的革命的主观力量的天才的论断“……它在中国的环境里不仅是具备了发展的可能性，简直是具备了发展的必然性……”在一九三○年以后，中国革命的主观力量日益发展，直至成为夺取政权的不可战胜的强大力量。这个事实，证明了这一论断的完全正确，突出地表现了毛主席天才的预见力。
    其次，在《关于群众生活，注意工作方法》一文中，毛主席曾这样说：“同志们，真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。在革命政府的周围团结起千百万群众来，发展我们的革命战争，我们就能消灭一切反革命，我们就能夺取全中国。”这是蔑视敌人，坚信自己的革命事业一定会胜利的声音。
    从毛主席这些历史性的文献中，我更深的感觉到作为一个革命者，要善于掌握丰富的材料作缜密的科学分析，也就是要掌握马克思列宁主义与毛泽东思想的实质，否则就会犯错误。又在工作时，我们必须依靠群众；养成联系群众、相信群众的工作作风。否则，就将一事无成。我们还应该学习毛主席的革命的乐观主义的态度，即使环境再艰苦，我们也要有信心克服困难。
                  一读者
    学习毛主席的阶级分析方法编辑同志：
    八月三日我订了学习计划，其中重要的一部分就是要认真钻研人民日报陆续发表的毛主席的伟大著作，进一步了解我们党三十年来的斗争历史，坚定自己的立场，在祖国的国防建设中更好地发挥自己的力量。
    我读过几篇论文之后，认识到毛主席的每一著作都是为了解决各个历史时期的每一具体问题而写的，也更明确了“马列主义不是教条而是行动的指南”这条真理；并了解到中国革命在每个危险紧急关头之所以能够克服错误的思想倾向，使党在复杂险恶环境中保持清醒头脑，终于赢得了今天的辉煌胜利，都是与毛主席的许多著作分不开的。
    如一九三五年中共瓦窑堡会议后，毛主席在《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》一文中，分析民族资产阶级在大敌当前的态度时说：“我们认为在殖民地化威胁的新环境之下，民族资产阶级的这些部分的态度可能发生变化。这个变化的特点就是他们的动摇。……现在的时期同一九二七年蒋介石叛变革命的时期有什么分别呢？那时的中国还是一个半殖民地。现在，正在走向殖民地。九年以来，他们抛弃了自己的同盟者工人阶级……得到的只不过是民族工商业的破产或半破产的境遇。因为这些情况，我们认为民族资产阶级的态度，在今天的时局下，有起变化的可能性。”这就是说，民族资产阶级这时有参加抗日的可能。毛主席又举出了代表民族资产阶级利益的蔡廷锴为例。他曾向红军打过死仗，后来又与红军订立抗日反蒋同盟，这就证明了民族资产阶级在当时可以参加革命的理由。
    从以上毛主席的论断中，我们看到了毛主席不仅精辟地分析了民族资产阶级的阶级本质，而且掌握了新的历史条件下民族资产阶级参加革命的可能性，批判了党内某些同志否认民族资产阶级有可能参加革命的错误，使他们认识到广泛地建立抗日民族统一战线的重要。因此，我们要想学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，做个真正的马克思主义者，必须首先学习这样的阶级分析方法，掌握变化中的新的条件，来进行我们的革命工作。

    煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司
    把大批好木料委托私商出售
    却不好好供应基本建设需要编辑同志：
    八月十七日政务院发布了关于节约木材的指示，同时又成立木材检查组开始检查，我除竭诚拥护和认真执行这一指示外，对于中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司有关供应木料方面的事，愿提出一点意见，请木材检查组考虑。
    本年中央人民政府政务院房屋统筹分配委员会分配工程任务时，规定所有木料统由中国煤业建筑器材公司负责供应。但该公司北京分公司出售的木料质量很坏，只有百分之四十可用，而且都不能用作架子材料。我们为了保证基本建设工程的质量，就不得不以高于牌价的价格向北京永茂建筑公司和河北公安干部学校购买好木料（已在本月十八日人民日报读者来信栏发表）。这样使我们公司直接受到损失，国家和人民的财产也同样受了损失。因此，我们就怀疑：中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司为什么没有好木料，而河北公安干部学校却出售好木料？希望木料检查组迅速检查处理。
    同时，我们开始很相信中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司能够供应基本建设的木料。可是该公司出售的木料都是坏木料。我们为保证工程质量曾要求售给好木料，该公司同志说：“就是这个木料，不要这个，没有别的。”可是后来我们在市场上寻木料时，找到私营“德记贸易商行”放有中国煤业建筑器材公司大批好木料，据说是为该公司代销，价格非常高。如今年六月上半月售给石景山钢铁厂木料一千立方公尺，当时器材公司的牌价最高是每立方公尺一百八十万元，而“德记贸易商行”出售的价格却是每一立方公尺二百二十万元。因此我们又怀疑：中国煤业建筑器材公司北京分公司为什么把好木料放在私营“德记贸易商行”高价出售，而把坏木料放在公司里，并且说“没有别的”？这是否违犯政府法令？也希望检查组迅速检查。

    阜阳公营红星印刷厂
    不应攫取非法利润编辑同志：
    皖北阜阳公营（阜阳专署领导）红星印刷厂，今年五月份成立。该厂一切工具设备还没有完成，就冒然承印专署代各县印制七十九令纸的夏征串票。但是串票是有时间性的，红星印刷厂当时既无生产能力，就不得不把这项生产转让给私营印刷厂。就这样转手之间，红星印刷厂竟要求各私营商户，在这项生产的纯利中抽出二分之一。私营户觉得印串票利润本来不大，如再被抽取一半，实在太不合算。因此经过再次协商，决定只从纯利中抽出三分之一给红星印刷厂。就这样，红星印刷厂把接收的七十九令纸的串票生产分给了五家私营印刷厂分别承印。红星印刷厂在一收一出之间，竟不费分文成本，而得到了三分之一纯利。这件事情，表面上是经私营商户同意了的，但是在背地里，私营商户仍然很不满意。
    我认为红星印刷厂利用公营地位去获得非法利润的做法是不对的。因此希望有关方面进行检查和研究。
                戴显武
    编者按：阜阳公营红星印刷厂，既是一个生产单位，就应从生产中取得合法利润，发展该厂。该厂承包政府的订货，再转包给私商从中取利，显然是错误的。我们认为阜阳红星印刷厂这样做，实际受损失的是订印串票的当地政府。对此，望当地政府进行检查与纠正。
