Comrades,

The Vietnamese People's Delegation to China is honored to participate in this celebration of the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. On behalf of the Vietnamese People's Army and the Vietnamese people, I warmly congratulate the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the brilliant victories it has achieved under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

For twenty-four years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has displayed its heroic fighting will throughout the country, resulting in the annihilation of millions of reactionary troops of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and thereby clearing away the remaining forces of the US-British imperialist bloc, the common enemy of all oppressed nations, in China.

Comrades, the Vietnamese people have deeply understood the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought and have drawn many valuable lessons from the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people are closely united and actively engaged in an armed struggle for liberation against the aggressors. The broad unity of the entire Vietnamese people is the source of strength for the Vietnamese People's armed forces. Since its establishment in 1941, this army has brought the glorious victory of the August Revolution of 1945 to the Vietnamese people, and today it is tirelessly fighting against the invasion of French colonialists and American imperialist interventionists.

In order to accomplish our liberation cause, the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army are constantly learning more valuable experiences from the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

To express the Vietnamese people's admiration for the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we respectfully present two banners to Commander-in-Chief Zhu and the Chinese People's Liberation Army as a memento.

Standing in the world camp of peace and democracy, alongside the great Soviet army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army have even greater confidence in their own victory, in the victory of all oppressed nations, and in the victory of the world camp of peace and democracy.

We wish the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the education of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, to gloriously fulfill the sacred task of defending China and world peace.

Long live the fighting spirit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
Long live the friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese people!
Long live Chairman Mao!

　　在首都庆祝建军节大会上
    越南人民访华代表团黄国越团长的颂词
    各位同志：
    越南人民访华代表团这次很荣幸地参加中国人民解放军建军二十四周年庆祝大会，我谨代表越南人民军与越南人民热烈庆祝中国人民解放军在毛主席与朱总司令英明的领导下所获得的辉煌的胜利。
    二十四年来，中国人民解放军在全国范围内发挥他们的英勇的战斗意志，结果是把蒋介石匪帮几百万的反动军队歼灭，并从而肃清了各被压迫民族的公敌——美英帝国主义集团在中国的残余力量。
    各位同志：越南人民已深刻地体会到毛泽东思想的伟大，并从中国人民和中国人民解放军中吸取了许多宝贵的经验。在胡志明主席的领导下，越南人民正紧密地团结起来，积极地进行着反对侵略者而自求解放的武装斗争。越南全国人民广泛的团结，是越南人民武装的力量的泉源。这支军队自一九四一年建立之日起，就已为越南人民带来了一九四五年八月革命辉煌的胜利，今天正强烈地为反对法殖民主义者和美帝国主义干涉者的侵掠而不懈地战斗着。
    为完成我们的解放事业，越南人民和越南人民军正在不断地向中国人民和中国人民解放军学习更多的宝贵经验。
    为表示越南人民对中国人民解放军战士的敬仰，我们谨将锦旗两面赠与朱总司令和中国人民解放军作为纪念。
    站在世界和平民主阵营里，站在伟大的苏联军队和中国人民解放军的旁边，越南人民和越南人民军对自己的胜利，对各被压迫民族的胜利以及世界和平民主阵营的胜利更深具信心。
    我们谨祝中国人民解放军在中国共产党、毛主席和朱总司令的教育下，光荣地完成保卫中国及世界和平的神圣的任务。
    中国人民解放军的战斗精神万岁！
    越中人民友谊万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
