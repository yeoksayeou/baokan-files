    Learning Chairman Mao's Class Analysis Method and Correcting One's Standpoint and Viewpoint
To the Editors:
    After recently reading Chairman Mao's article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," I have two main takeaways:
    (1) The class analysis method is a sharp weapon for understanding all things. Although I usually study Marxist-Leninist books constantly, my understanding is not always deep. When I encounter relatively complex real-world problems, I often don't know where to start and cannot analyze them effectively. If I force myself to analyze, I am prone to making mistakes. As for the reasons for these errors, the main issue for me is a vague stance and viewpoint, which prevents me from directly judging things. After studying Chairman Mao's class analysis method, I realized that the fundamental approach to solving problems is to start with class analysis.
    (2) In Chairman Mao's outstanding work, he points out the loyal and reliable allies of the Chinese proletariat revolution. During the Great Revolution, just as Chiang Kai-shek "organized an anti-communist, anti-Soviet conspiracy, taking advantage of pretexts he himself created to attack the position of the Communist Party in the army and in the leadership organs of the Kuomintang" (Hu Qiaomu, "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party"), and the "two kinds of opportunism, headed by Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao, both felt their strength was insufficient and did not know where to find strength, where to obtain broad allies" (Annotation by the Editorial Committee of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"), Chairman Mao "pointed out that the broadest and most loyal ally of the Chinese proletariat was the peasantry, thus solving the most important ally problem in the Chinese revolution." (Ibid.) Thus, "Comrade Mao Zedong opposed both Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunism, which only saw the bourgeoisie and the Kuomintang and did not see the peasantry, and Zhang Guotao's left-leaning opportunism, which only saw the workers and did not see the peasantry." (Hu Qiaomu, "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party")

    学习毛主席的阶级分析方法  端正自己的立场观点编辑同志：
    最近我读了毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》一文，我有两点体会：
    （一）阶级分析方法，是认识一切事物的锐利武器。我平日虽然也不断地学习马克思列宁主义的书籍，但了解总不深刻，一遇到比较复杂的现实问题，往往便无从下手，分析不开；勉强分析，就会发生错误。至于错误的原因，在我主要就是立场、观点模糊，因而对事物不能直截了当地加以判断。学习了毛主席的阶级分析方法以后，才知道解决问题的根本方法，只有从阶级分析入手。
    （二）在毛主席这篇杰出的著作里，指出了中国无产阶级革命的忠实可靠的同盟军。在大革命时期中，正当蒋介石“组织了反共反苏的阴谋，利用他自己所制造的借口打击共产党在军队中和国民党领导机关中的地位”（胡乔木：《中国共产党的三十年》）、而以陈独秀和张国焘为首的“两种机会主义都感觉自己力量不足，而不知道到何处去寻找力量，到何处去取得广大的同盟军”（《毛泽东选集出版委员会》按语）的时候，毛主席则“指出中国无产阶级的最广大和最忠实的同盟军是农民，这样就解决了中国革命中的最主要的同盟军问题。”（同上）这样，“毛泽东同志就既反对了陈独秀的只看见资产阶级和国民党而看不见农民的右倾机会主义，也反对了张国焘的只看见工人而看不见农民的左倾机会主义。”（胡乔木：《中国共产党的三十年》）
