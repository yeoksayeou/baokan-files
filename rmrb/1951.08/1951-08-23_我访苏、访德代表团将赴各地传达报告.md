　　Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The Chinese-Soviet Friendship Association delegation to the Soviet Union to attend the "May Day" celebrations and the Chinese People's delegation to the "Sino-German Friendship Month" will soon give reports in major cities across the country. The Chinese People's National Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea and the All-China Federation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have jointly issued a notice instructing the local sub-committees to Resist America and Aid Korea and the branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to ensure the work of delivering the reports is done well.
　　The notice stipulates that the major administrative regions should jointly determine the report plans for their respective regions by the major administrative regions' sub-committees to Resist America and Aid Korea and the branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The Southwest and Northwest major administrative regions, as well as certain organs and troops, which did not send representatives to the delegation this time, will have representatives sent by the central organs to deliver the reports. It is best to convene report meetings for workers, students, cadres, and troops separately, so that the reporters can focus on delivering content closely related to the audience according to their needs.
　　It is understood that the Chinese-Soviet Friendship Association delegation to the Soviet Union to attend the "May Day" celebrations departed for the Soviet Union on April 16th and has now returned to China in batches. Some of the representatives also organized to participate in the "Sino-German Friendship Month" delegation and went to Berlin to participate in the "Sino-German Friendship Month" which began on June 8th.

    通知规定以大行政区为单位，由各大行政区抗美援朝总分会及中苏友好协会总分会共同商定各该区的传达计划。此次未派代表参加代表团的西南、西北大行政区以及某些机关、部队，由中央各机关派出的代表前往传达。传达报告会最好能分别召集工人、学生、干部、部队等，以便报告人能根据听众要求着重传达与听众有密切关系的内容。
    按中苏友好协会赴苏参加“五一”节观礼代表团是四月十六日启程赴苏的，现已先后返国。其中一部分代表并曾组织参加“德中友好月”代表团，赴柏林参加了六月八日开始举行的“德中友好月”。
