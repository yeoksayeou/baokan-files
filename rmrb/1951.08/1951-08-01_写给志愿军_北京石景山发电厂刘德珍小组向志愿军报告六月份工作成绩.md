　　Letter to the Volunteer Army
    The Liu Dezhen Group of the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant Reports on Work Achievements in June to the Volunteer Army
    Dear Volunteer Army Comrades:
    In order to support your just struggle and to build our motherland, our group actively responded to the call of the China Peace Committee and formulated and revised the Patriotic Pact, and promoted the launch of a patriotic safety, increased production, and donation campaign throughout the plant. Article 5 of our Patriotic Pact stipulates that we report our work achievements to you every month. Now, we will report to you on the implementation of the Patriotic Pact in June.
    In June, the state assigned us the task of overhauling a certain generator. In this combat-oriented work, we encountered many difficulties, but whenever we thought of your heroic battles, we felt a hundred times more energetic. In this way, we overcame the difficulties, fully implemented the Patriotic Pact, and overfulfilled the task.
    Dear Volunteer Army Comrades! The quality of our overhaul this time reached 100 percent, and there was not a single piece of rework. After this overhaul, the vibration of the generator was reduced by 40 percent. This provides a greater guarantee for the safety of electricity use in the people's capital. In this month, we put forward seven reasonable suggestions; we overfulfilled the plan stipulated in the Patriotic Pact to save 2,000 catties of millet for the country every month. In terms of learning, 100 percent of our group participated in Party class studies; the average score of the group in technical studies reached 74 points. Our group leader, Comrade Liu Dezhen, a national model worker, suggested changing from a one-shift system to a day and night shift system in order to complete the work task ahead of schedule. He often leads the work in both day and night shifts. In this way, the important work of finding the center during the inspection was completed ahead of schedule.
    Dear Volunteer Army Comrades! In order to support you, in addition to the increased production efforts mentioned above, we have also decided to contribute one day of work per month. Comrade Zhang Xueyi of our group suffered from back pain due to overwork, but when he thought of your heroic behavior of fighting without leaving the front line with injuries, he also stayed at his post despite his illness.
    We read about your heroic deeds in the newspapers every day. On July 2nd, we read the news that the Korean front was about to hold armistice negotiations. We know that this is the result of your and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side and giving the enemy a heavy blow. However, we will never relax our work in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea because of this. We know that the U.S. imperialists are inherently vicious, and they are still trying every means to obstruct and delay the Korean armistice negotiations; moreover, they are still obstructing our liberation of Taiwan, and they also want to arm Japan and West Germany. Therefore, we are determined to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, continue to thoroughly implement the Patriotic Pact, and continue to work hard to consolidate and develop national defense construction and economic construction.

　　写给志愿军
    北京石景山发电厂刘德珍小组向志愿军报告六月份工作成绩
    亲爱的志愿军同志们：
    我们小组为了支援你们的正义的战斗，为了建设我们的祖国，积极响应抗美援朝总会的号召，订立并修订了爱国公约，并带动全厂展开了爱国安全增产捐献竞赛。我们爱国公约的第五条规定：每月向你们报告工作成绩。现在，我们就把六月份执行爱国公约的情况向你们报告一下。
    六月份国家给我们的任务是大修某号发电机，在这个战斗性的工作中，我们遇到过很多困难，但是一想起了你们的英勇战斗，我们就感到精神百倍。这样，我们就战胜了困难，全部实现了爱国公约，并超额完成了任务。
    亲爱的志愿军同志们！我们这次大修，工作质量达到了百分之百，没有出过一件反工活。经过这次检修，发电机震动程度降低了百分之四十。这就使人民首都用电的安全有了更大的保证。在这一月中，我们提出了七件合理化建议；超额完成了爱国公约中所规定每月为国家节省二千斤小米的计划。在学习上，我们全组百分之百参加了党课学习；技术学习的成绩全组平均达到七十四分。我们的组长——全国劳动模范刘德珍同志，为了提前完成工作任务，建议改一班制为白天、前夜两班制。他经常在日夜两班领导工作。这样，就使检查当中的找中心的重要工作，提前完成了。
    亲爱的志愿军同志们！为了支援你们，我们除了上面所说的努力增产以外，我们还决定每月献工一天。我们组的张学义同志，因劳累而腰痛，但他想到了你们带伤不下火线的英勇行为，他也就带病不离工场。
    我们每天从报纸上读到你们的英雄事迹。七月二日那一天，我们读到了朝鲜前线将要举行停战谈判的消息，我们知道这是你们和朝鲜人民军并肩战斗给予了敌人沉重打击的结果。但是我们决不因此而丝毫松懈抗美援朝的工作。我们知道美帝国主义者是凶恶成性的，它们还在千方百计阻挠和拖延朝鲜的停战谈判；而且它们还在阻挠我们解放台湾，他们还要武装日本和西德。因此我们决心加强抗美援朝的工作，继续深入贯彻爱国公约，为巩固与发展国防建设和经济建设而继续努力。
