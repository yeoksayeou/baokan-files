To the Editors:

The publication of "A Record of the Investigation into the History of Wu Xun" not only clearly depicts Wu Xun's ugly image, but also further proves the correctness of the People's Daily editorial "Attention Should Be Paid to the Discussion of the Film <The Life of Wu Xun>" two months ago regarding Wu Xun, providing us with a scientific model for historical research and ideological criticism.

Since the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" began, many newspapers and periodicals, especially the People's Daily, have continuously exposed Wu Xun's life and the truth about his establishment of "free schools," awakening many people who had been trapped in Wu Xun's delusion for a long time. For example, the description of the struggle history of the peasant revolutionary leader Song Jingshi powerfully refutes the fallacy of those who advocate the "limitation of historical conditions," and even more powerfully refutes Sun Yu's deception of "one civil, one military." From this, we deeply realize that when evaluating historical figures and events, collecting information is important, but using what standpoint and views to analyze this information is even more important.

In the past, almost all records of Wu Xun's deeds were glorifications from the standpoint of the reactionary ruling class. However, in the hands of the people, due to analysis from the standpoint of the people and the viewpoint of historical materialism, the opposite conclusion is reached. In 1927, Chairman Mao pointed out in his "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" that at that time, in the city of Changsha, people heard talk of peasant rebellion in the countryside everywhere, which was truly "terrible." Where did this argument come from? It turned out to be from "the middle and upper strata of society to the right wing of the Kuomintang." This argument even made "even very revolutionary people, oppressed by the city-wide clamor of that 'terrible' faction, close their eyes and think about the situation in the countryside, and become discouraged, unable to deny this word 'terrible.'" But in Chairman Mao's view, what the peasants were doing at that time was precisely "what Mr. Sun Yat-sen had been striving for in the national revolution for forty years, but had not achieved." Chairman Mao said: "This is a miraculous achievement that has not been accomplished in forty years or even thousands of years. This is very good. There is absolutely nothing 'terrible,' and it is absolutely not 'terrible.'" It is clear that the same thing, two standpoints, two views, will inevitably lead to two conclusions. The reason why so many people blindly worshiped Wu Xun in the past was partly due to being oppressed by the arguments of Wu Xun's glorifiers. Those who have not fully awakened after reading the articles criticizing Wu Xun should wake up after reading "A Record of the Investigation into the History of Wu Xun."

Sun Yu, the screenwriter and director of "The Life of Wu Xun," did conduct on-the-spot investigations of Wu Xun's deeds, but what was the result of the investigation? Due to the wrong standpoint and views, the result of the investigation was still "Wu Xun stood firm on the class position," "established free schools for poor children," and "served the masses of the people." Zhao Dan, in the investigation experience, when he saw that kind of "vulgar air of being obsessed with fame and fortune, a lazy good-for-nothing who used begging to run schools as a cover, almost lost even the most basic smell of a farmer" (Zhao Dan: "How I Played Wu Xun"), he thought it was just "one generation is not as good as the previous one," and "would harm the temperament of the real Wu Xun," and did not realize that Wu Xun himself was a worthless slave. Thus, it can be seen that the most fundamental issue is the issue of standpoint and views. Therefore, we should not only learn the investigation methods of "A Record of the Investigation into the History of Wu Xun," but also learn its standpoint and views for discerning things.

### 学习“武训历史调查团”的立场、观点和方法

　　学习“武训历史调查团”的立场、观点和方法编辑同志：
    《武训历史调查记》的发表，不但清楚地刻划出武训的丑恶形相，而且更进一步证明了两个多月前人民日报社论《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》对武训所下论断的正确，给我们提供了一个科学的历史研究和思想批判工作的范例。
    电影《武训传》的批判展开以后，许多报刊，特别是人民日报，连续揭露了武训的一生事迹及其兴办“义学”的真相，使许多长时间坠入武训迷魂阵的人都清醒过来了。如文中关于农民革命领袖宋景诗的斗争史实的描述，就有力地驳斥了“历史条件限制”论者的谬说，更有力地驳斥了孙瑜“一文一武”的欺骗。从这里我们深刻体会到：对历史人物及事件的评价，收集情况资料固然是重要的，但用什么立场、观点来分析这些情况却是更重要的。
    过去关于武训事迹的记载几乎全部是站在反动统治阶级的立场上加以歌颂的，而到了人民的手里，由于用人民的立场与历史唯物主义的观点加以分析，就得出相反的结论。一九二七年毛主席在“湖南农民运动考察报告”中曾经指出，当时在长沙城里，街头巷尾都听到人们谈农民在乡下造反，真是“糟得很”。这种议论是从何而来的呢？原来是“从中层以上社会至国民党右派”来的。这种议论竟至使得“即使是很革命的人罢，受了那班‘糟得很’派的满城风雨的议论所压迫，他闭眼一想乡村的情况，也就气馁起来，没有法子否认这‘糟’字。”但在毛主席看来：当时农民所做的正是“孙中山先生致力国民革命凡四十年，所要做而没有做到的事”。毛主席说：“这是四十年乃至几千年未曾成就过的奇勋。这是好得很。完全没有什么‘糟’，完全不是什么‘糟得很’。”足见同样的事，两个立场，两种观点，必然得出两种结论。武训过去之所以有如此众多的人盲目崇拜他，有的也是由于受了武训歌颂者议论的压迫，这些被压迫者，如果读了批判武训的文章还没有完全苏醒过来，那末，读了《武训历史调查记》后，是应该清醒过来了。
    《武训传》的编导者孙瑜，对武训的事迹并非没有进行过实地的调查，但调查又怎么样呢？由于立场、观点不对头，调查的结果还是“武训站稳了阶级立场”、“为穷孩子兴办义学”、“为人民大众服务”。赵丹在调查体验中，当他看到了那种“其为名利熏心的庸俗气，借行乞兴学为幌子的不事劳动的二流子，几乎连最起码的庄稼人的气味都失掉了”（赵丹：“我怎样演武训”）的时候，还以为只是“一代不如一代”，“会伤害了真正武训的气质的”，而没有认识到武训本人就是一钱不值的奴才。由此可见最根本的问题是立场、观点的问题。因此，我们不仅要学习《武训历史调查记》的调查方法，还要学习它鉴别事物的立场和观点。
