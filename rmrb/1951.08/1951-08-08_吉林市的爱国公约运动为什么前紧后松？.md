　　Why Did the Patriotic Pact Movement in Jilin City Start Strong but End Weak?
　　The Communist Party of China Jilin City Committee
　　Since the beginning of April, people from all walks of life in Jilin City have widely launched a movement to establish patriotic pacts. According to statistics from early June, a total of 1,847 patriotic pacts were established in the city. These patriotic pacts were mostly established by workshops, groups, classes, bureaus, residential groups, and industries. The number of people participating in the pacts accounted for 80% of the city's population.

　　During the signing of the pacts, the Propaganda Department of the CPC Jilin City Committee organized reporters and propagandists to conduct publicity and reports on the establishment of patriotic pacts to the people of the city by district, and also held amateur training classes for propaganda cadres in streets and small and medium-sized factories to educate cadres and promote this work. In early June, the city's leading organs sampled the implementation of patriotic pacts in some units. In mid-June, the city held a meeting of representatives for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, focusing on discussing the significance of the patriotic pact movement and the methods for inspecting and revising patriotic pacts. Subsequently, the work of inspecting and revising patriotic pacts was widely carried out. By late July, the city had completed the inspection.

　　According to the inspection results of various units, the patriotic pacts signed by the people of the city played a significant role in consolidating the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, raising the political consciousness of the masses, and promoting the progress of various tasks in the initial stage. The role of the patriotic pacts in various units was particularly significant in the production competition to welcome "May Day," the "May Day" parade, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. However, after "May Day," not many units were able to persist in implementing the patriotic pacts.

　　Why couldn't they persist in implementing them? One of the reasons is that the publicity and education work during the signing of the pacts was not done enough. Most of the patriotic pacts were not formulated after full deliberation and discussion by the masses, but were drafted by cadres from top to bottom and submitted to everyone for approval. The inspection found that many masses and cadres still did not understand why patriotic pacts should be signed. The chairman of the Fourth Workshop Trade Union of a certain factory said: "The above shouted, and the below did it. We didn't know what was going on in our hearts, and we didn't explain it clearly to the workers. Everyone just put together a few articles." Although this type of patriotic pact played some role in calling for action at the time of signing, it failed to make the masses consciously persist in implementing it. Many units did not check the implementation of the pact after signing it to correct the shortcomings in the pact and gradually improve it. Some units ignored the patriotic pact after it was signed, and the leading cadres also forgot what the pact contained. Some people reacted: "We were very enthusiastic at the beginning, but after a few days, we saw that no one cared, so we slackened off, and later we forgot about the patriotic pact."

　　In addition, when some units signed patriotic pacts, although they also mobilized the masses to discuss them, everyone's understanding of the patriotic pacts was not clear. They did not know how to focus on their own business, connect with the current political tasks, find out the main problems of their units, study solutions, and then put forward specific goals as the main content of the patriotic pacts. Instead, everyone arbitrarily put together some articles. The patriotic pacts formulated in this way were either abstract and empty, or very cumbersome, difficult to implement and impossible to check.

　　Why did these problems arise? The main reason is that the main leading cadres of various units generally did not pay attention to political work and opposed business work to political work. Some leading cadres simply did not care about the political movement of establishing patriotic pacts.

　　In contrast, the leading cadres of some units regarded the patriotic pact as one of the best forms of educating and organizing the masses, as a system to promote the central work, and conducted education in combination with specific work, leading the masses to formulate practical and specific patriotic pacts. They also paid close attention to inspection during implementation. The patriotic pacts in these units played a huge role. It can be seen that in promoting the patriotic pact movement, the most important issue is whether the leading cadres have a correct understanding of the patriotic pacts and whether they seriously lead this work. To solve this problem, we must first correct their bias of not paying attention to political work.

　　吉林市的爱国公约运动为什么前紧后松？
    中共吉林市委员会
    吉林市各阶层人民，从四月初开始，普遍开展订立爱国公约的运动。据六月初统计，全市共订立了一千八百四十七份爱国公约。这些爱国公约，多是以车间、小组、班级、局处、居民组、行业为单位订立的。参加订约的人数，占全市人口的百分之八十。
    在订约时，中共吉林市委宣传部曾组织报告员、宣传员，分区向全市人民进行了有关订立爱国公约的宣传、报告，并举办了街道的和中小工厂的宣传干部业余轮训班，以教育干部，推动这一工作。六月初，该市领导机关曾抽查了一部分单位执行爱国公约的情况；六月中旬，全市召开抗美援朝代表会议，着重研讨爱国公约运动的意义和检查、修订爱国公约的办法。接着，便普遍展开了检查、修订爱国公约的工作，到七月下旬，全市已检查完毕。
    根据各单位检查的结果来看，全市人民所订爱国公约，在开始阶段，对巩固群众爱国热情、提高群众政治觉悟、推动各项工作前进都起了重大作用。在迎接“五一”的生产竞赛、“五一”大游行、镇压反革命等运动中，各单位爱国公约所起的作用尤为显著。但是，“五一”节以后，能够坚持执行爱国公约的单位就不多了。
    为什么不能坚持执行呢？原因之一是订约时的宣传教育工作做得不够，大多数爱国公约不是经过群众充分地酝酿讨论后订出来的，而是自上而下地由干部拟定条文，交大家通过的。检查中发现，许多群众与干部还不明了为什么要订爱国公约。某厂第四车间工会主席说：“上面一喊，下边就干。心里不摸底，也没给工友讲清楚，大家凑几条就算了。”这一类的爱国公约，虽然在订约当时也曾或多或少地起了一些号召作用，但未能使群众自觉地坚持执行。许多单位在订约之后，都没有检查其执行情况，以改正公约中的缺点，逐步提高。有的单位在订出爱国公约之后，就置之不理了，领导干部也忘记了公约有些什么内容。有的群众反应：“开始时我们情绪很高，过了几天看见没有人管，也就松劲了，以后又都忘记了爱国公约那回事。”
    另外，有的单位在订爱国公约时，虽然也发动群众讨论了，但大家对爱国公约的认识不明确，不知道围绕自己的业务，联系当前的政治任务，找出本单位的主要问题，研求解决办法，然后提出具体的奋斗目标，作为爱国公约的主要内容，而是由大家随意凑一些条文。这样订出的爱国公约，有的抽象空洞，有的十分繁琐，不易执行也无法检查。
    为什么产生上述这些问题呢？主要是因为各单位的主要领导干部普遍地不重视政治工作，把业务工作和政治工作对立起来的缘故。有的领导干部根本就不关心订立爱国公约这一政治运动。
    与此相反，有的单位的领导干部，把爱国公约当作教育和组织群众的最好形式之一，当作推动中心工作的一种制度，结合具体工作进行了教育，领导群众订出了切实、具体的爱国公约，执行中又抓紧检查，这些单位的爱国公约都发挥了极大的作用。这里可以看出，在推行爱国公约运动中，最重要的问题是在于领导干部是否对爱国公约有正确的认识，是否认真地去领导这一工作。要解决这一问题，首先就必须纠正他们不重视政治工作的偏向。
