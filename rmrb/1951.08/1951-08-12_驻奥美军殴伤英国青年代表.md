Xinhua News Agency, London, August 8th (TASS): Bush, the chairman of the British Workers' Music Association who led a large choir to Berlin to participate in the World Youth and Students for Peace Festival, was obstructed by U.S. occupying forces in Austria. He telephoned the British Workers' Music Association in London to report the barbaric actions of the American troops against the British representatives. He said: When the train from Innsbruck to Salzburg arrived at the border of the American occupation zone, a group of American officers and soldiers boarded the train for inspection. Among all the passengers going to Linz, anyone with a ticket but without a special pass was brutally dragged off the train by three or four soldiers. Soon, three piles of people gathered along the railway line, each pile surrounded by several American soldiers. The train then successively brought many French and British representatives, and the total number of people detained on the railway line eventually reached about one hundred and thirty. They were guarded, without water or food all night, and anyone who made any demands of the guards was often cursed with the most vile language. They were not allowed to call the British consulate. They ordered the youths to board the train and return to Innsbruck. The youths refused. As the youths were forced to stand on the railway tracks with bayonets, a train rushed towards them, injuring two girls. A doctor among those detained wanted to provide first aid but was stopped by the U.S. military. Later, thirty American soldiers fixed bayonets and drove the representatives into the carriages. Several representatives were stabbed by bayonets, and one representative was beaten with a rifle butt, leaving five wounds near his eyes.
    The British Workers' Music Association has sent a letter to the American Embassy to protest and demand compensation for the youth representatives who were beaten by the U.S. military. At the same time, the association also wrote to Attlee and Morrison, requesting the British government to protest against this matter.

　　驻奥美军殴伤英国青年代表
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社伦敦八日讯：率领一个大合唱团去柏林参加世界青年与学生和平联欢节的英国工人音乐协会主席布许，在奥地利被美占领军所阻。他打电话向伦敦英国工人音乐协会报告了美国军队对英国代表们的野蛮行动。他说：当从音斯布鲁克到萨尔斯堡的火车抵达美国占领区边境时，一群美国军官和士兵登车检查。所有去林嗣的旅客中，凡是有车票而没有特别通行证的。每人都被三、四个士兵野蛮地拖下车去。铁路线上不久便聚了三堆人，每一堆人都由几个美国士兵包围着。火车随后又陆续带来了许多英法代表，被截留在铁路上的人最后共有一百三十人左右。他们被监视着，一整夜没有水喝，也没有食物，谁要是向监视的士兵有什么要求，往往被他们用最下流的话痛骂一顿。他们不许代表向英国领事馆打电话。他们叫青年们上火车，折回音斯布鲁克。青年们拒绝了。当青年们被刺刀迫着站在铁路上时，一列火车冲了过来，轧伤了两个女孩子，这些被拘留的人当中有一个医生想去救护，但被美军制止。后来，三十名美国士兵上起刺刀，把代表们赶到车厢里去。好几个代表被刺刀刺伤了，一个代表被枪托殴打，眼睛附近留下了五处伤痕。
    英国工人音乐协会已致函美国大使馆提出抗议，并要求对被美军殴伤的青年代表给予赔偿。该会同时并写信给艾德礼和莫里逊，要求英国政府对此事提出抗议。
