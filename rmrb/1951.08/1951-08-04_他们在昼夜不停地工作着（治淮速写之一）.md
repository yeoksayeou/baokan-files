The Huai River is one of the most disaster-prone rivers in Chinese history. According to incomplete records, from 246 BC to 1948 AD, the Huai River experienced 979 major floods.

In 1938, the Kuomintang reactionary government breached the southern levee of the Yellow River at Huayuankou, causing the Yellow River to flood into the Huai River, resulting in more than ten years of "major disasters in heavy rain, minor disasters in light rain" in the Huai River basin, causing serious disasters to millions of people along the Huai River. In order to relieve the suffering of the people along the Huai River, the Central People's Government issued instructions last year to fundamentally control the Huai River, and allocated hundreds of millions of catties of grain for the Huai River project, mobilizing more than two million people to participate in the great Huai River control project in order to fundamentally control the Huai River.

This is the construction situation of the Runheji Sluice Dam project. Thirty to forty thousand workers and cadres are working day and night to complete the project before the flood season. (Attached picture)

    他们在昼夜不停地工作着（治淮速写之一）
    邓澍  顾群作
    淮河是中国历史上多灾的河流之一。根据不完全的记载，从纪元前二四六年到纪元後一九四八年的两千余年间，淮河曾发生较大的水灾九百七十九次。
    一九三八年，国民党反动政府在花园口掘开黄河南堤，黄河水泛侵入淮河，以致造成十余年来淮河流域“大雨大灾、小雨小灾”的现象。使沿淮千百万人民遭到严重灾难。中央人民政府为了解除沿淮人民的痛苦，于去年发出根治淮河的指示，并批拨数亿斤治淮工粮，动员二百余万人参加了伟大的治淮工程，以求根治淮河。
    这是润河集闸霸工程施工情形。三、四万工人和干部正在日夜不停地工作着，争取在汛期以前竣工。（附图片）
