    Readers' Letters

    To the Editor:
    Whether a Party newspaper values readers' letters and contributions is an important yardstick for measuring the quality of the newspaper's mass work. Because only by relying on the masses can the newspaper gain vitality. The Shanghai Liberation Daily has shortcomings in its mass work. In the "Literary" section, issue No. 46 of May 26th, the article "Wu Xun and "The Story of Wu Xun" (Part 1)" written by Comrade Xue Wei actually quoted erroneous material from Zhang Mosheng's "Biography of Wu Xun, the Beggar." Because of this, I wrote three letters to the Liberation Daily editorial department between early June and mid-July inquiring about this matter. However, the result was not even a single response. Furthermore, on June 25th, I sent the newspaper an article about the competitive purchasing and panic buying in the rapeseed market in the Chaohu area, the abnormal rise in prices, and the gradual decline in specifications, which would have been helpful for improving work if published when summer crops were being harvested. However, the newspaper did not inform me of the final disposition of the manuscript.

专栏：读者来信

    报社应重视读者来信编辑同志：
    党报对读者来信来稿是否重视，是测量报纸群众工作好坏的一个重要标尺。因为报纸只有依靠了它，才能使报纸取得生命力。上海解放日报在群众工作上是有缺点的。该报五月二十六日第四十六期《文艺》上，雪苇同志所写的《武训和〈武训传〉（上）》一文竟引用了张默生《义丐武训传》的错误材料。为此，我曾在六月上旬到七月中旬，先后写过三封信给解放日报编辑部询问这事。可是，结果连一点回音也没有。又如六月二十五日，我曾寄给该报一篇关于巢湖区菜籽市场争购、抢购，价格畸形上升与规格逐渐下降的稿件，这在夏季农作物登场的时候刊出，对工作的改进是有帮助的。可是，该报没有把对该稿的最后处理结果告诉我。
