　　Electric power industry has greatly developed over the past year. In 1950, the electricity consumption of the national state-owned power industry (referring to the state-owned power industry directly under the Ministry of Fuel Industry and entrusted to major administrative regions for management, excluding statistics from provincial and municipal power industries) increased by 46.9% compared to 1949; the planned electricity consumption for 1951 was to increase by 21.6% compared to 1950; the actual situation in the past six months proves that the actual electricity consumption will inevitably exceed this plan.

　　How to meet this constantly growing demand? Some people believe that only by massively increasing power generation and supply equipment can the problem be solved. Of course, to meet the needs of China's future industrial development, it is impossible not to increase power equipment. However, this is by no means the most important issue for the people's electric power industry at present, nor is it the fundamental policy in the operation of the people's electric power industry. The direction of the people's electric power industry should be: constantly and fully improving efficiency, conserving electricity, and ensuring a safe, sufficient, and inexpensive power supply required for industrial production with certain reasonable equipment. The most important issue at present is to fully utilize the capacity of existing equipment and to fully improve the electricity usage situation. It is clearly unreasonable to freeze and waste a large amount of existing equipment on the one hand, while unilaterally emphasizing adding equipment to increase power on the other.

　　Is the latent potential of China's electric power industry large or not? It should be said that it is still quite large. China's electric power industry, under the rule of the reactionary government for a long time, had always had very poor operating conditions, very low production efficiency, and very unreasonable electricity usage. For example, in the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan areas, the highest equipment utilization rate before liberation was only 37.4% in 1948. In the same year, the power lost in transmission lines and used for self-consumption in the same areas accounted for 40.54% of the total power generated, and the waste among users was even impossible to calculate. In the old electric power management thinking in China, these long-standing unreasonable phenomena were regarded as unchangeable facts. They could not see that the latent potential of the electric power industry could be further developed, and they thought that increasing equipment was the only way to improve power supply capacity. This backward and conservative thinking still exists quite seriously even after liberation. Since liberation, the national electric power industry has made some improvements in this regard. For example, in the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan areas, compared with 1948, the utilization rate in 1950 increased by 14.8%, and the line losses and self-consumption of electricity decreased by 44%. Nationwide state-owned power industry, compared with 1949, the utilization rate in 1950 increased by 13.7%, and the line losses and self-consumption of electricity decreased by 30.8%. However, the situation is still not good, and it is still far from the required standard. Although the utilization rate of the national state-owned power industry in 1950 increased significantly compared with 1949, the overall utilization rate only reached 29.7%; although the line losses and self-consumption of electricity in 1950 decreased significantly compared with 1949, they still accounted for 25% of the total power generated. We might as well use the standards of the Soviet electric power industry to measure our electric power industry: the equipment utilization rate of the Soviet electric power industry in 1950 was 70%, more than twice as high as ours; line losses and self-consumption of electricity accounted for 12% of the total power generated, less than half of ours. Naturally, we do not yet have some of the conditions of the Soviet electric power industry; but there is no doubt that China's electric power industry still has great latent potential that has not been tapped.

　　Judging from the utilization of existing power equipment nationwide and the use of electricity at the present stage, the most correct way to ensure a safe, sufficient, and inexpensive power supply is to fully utilize the existing equipment and maximize the latent potential; first and foremost, it should be to realistically improve technical standards, improve management methods, increase production efficiency, and conserve electricity consumption. Based on the current situation, if the utilization rate of national power equipment is increased to 50%, line losses and self-consumption of electricity are reduced to 18%, and user electricity consumption is saved by 15%, the national power supply capacity can be increased by one time that of 1950. This can save a large investment needed for millions of kilowatts of electricity; and it can take effect quickly, unlike the considerable time required to add new equipment.

　　Can this requirement be met? As long as everyone works hard, it is entirely possible.

　　For this purpose, the following things need to be done to fully utilize the capacity of power generation and supply equipment:

　　(1) All power industries nationwide, whether state-owned, private, or self-supplied power plants, must conduct regular, thorough, planned, and comprehensive overhaul work without exception. At present, more than 20% (hundreds of thousands of kilowatts) of the capacity of the national state-owned, private, and self-supplied power generation equipment is frozen due to years of disrepair and inability to cooperate with each other, and cannot be brought into play. Among them, the frozen capacity of the state-owned part accounts for 16% of the total capacity, and the frozen capacity of provincial, municipal, private, and some units' self-supplied power plants accounts for 28.5% of the total capacity. This is only the situation of power generation equipment. If we add the mismatch of power supply equipment that already exists in many areas, the power that can be supplied to users will be further discounted. This serious situation cannot be allowed to continue. The state-owned power industry has made many efforts in this regard in 1950, reducing the frozen capacity from 33% in 1949 to 16% in 1950. This work should be carried out in various power industries across the country in the future.

　　(2) We must do a good job in the unified dispatch of power generation and supply in regions or cities. According to the statistics of several major cities, the peak load of their total electricity consumption is within the range of one-third to three-quarters of the total equipment capacity. Because the power plants of various enterprises in the same city or region are not jointly used under unified dispatch, but are used under divided conditions, some power plants (especially those self-supplied by some units) have a considerable amount of excess capacity; while some power plants (mainly state-owned) have to restrict the opening of users. In 1950, some regions, such as the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan areas, under the leadership of local governments and state-owned power plants, began the work of unified power dispatch and achieved results, breaking the previous situation of division. However, some areas, although there is an urgent need to do so, have never done this work well. The main reason is that there is still departmentalism among the leading cadres in these enterprises (mainly referring to enterprises with power equipment that exceeds their own needs), emphasizing their own convenience and lacking a sense of responsibility for the country's overall economic work. The result of doing so not only harms the overall interests and wastes the country's resources, but also their own safe power generation and supply cannot be better guaranteed. How to do a good job in the unified dispatch of power generation and supply in regions or cities is a very important issue that should be resolved as soon as possible in the future.

　　(3) We must do a good job in adjusting the load to balance the load in each period. According to the statistics of several major cities and power grids, in 1950, their annual load factor was 66% at the highest and 35% at the lowest, and most of them were around 50%, with a very low average. This phenomenon shows that we have a large part of latent power that cannot be fully utilized due to the load being too high or too low at times. As long as we implement an appropriate load adjustment system, these latent power can be brought into play. At the end of 1950, under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, the Tianjin Power Supply Bureau piloted the load adjustment work of several large factories, balancing the weekly load, so that the Tianjin area could have 5% more supply capacity every day. This example shows that the work of adjusting the load should not only be done well, but also can be done well. Assuming that the peak load remains unchanged, if we can increase the national average load factor by 10%, the power supply capacity of the power industry will increase by 10%.

　　In terms of reducing losses and reducing waste, the following things need to be done:

　　(1) The national power industry should reduce self-consumption of electricity and line losses to the minimum. In 1950, thanks to the efforts of the national state-owned power industry employees, 323 million kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved compared with 1949. If calculated based on the equipment utilization rate of the same year, it is equivalent to adding a power plant with a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts. This achievement is commendable. This work has not been vigorously promoted in the power industry system outside of state-owned enterprises; the existing achievements of state-owned power enterprises also need to be further improved. It is necessary to fully mobilize workers, rely on workers, further increase the enthusiasm of the masses of workers, and strive to ensure that every kilowatt-hour of electricity is not wasted.

　　(2) Electricity users should enhance their sense of responsibility to the entire national people's economy, and in the production process, from management and technology, strictly implement economy, reduce waste, and use every kilowatt-hour of electricity in the most economical and reasonable way, saving every kilowatt-hour of electricity that can be saved, and supplying the needs of other departments and the development of production in this department. It should be understood that saving one kilowatt-hour of electricity means more investment in economic construction; wasting one kilowatt-hour of electricity means more losses in economic construction. According to the current data of various enterprise departments, the average electricity consumption per 20-count yarn in the textile industry in various regions ranges from 170 to 220 kilowatt-hours, with a difference of 30%; the electricity consumption for producing one ton of pig iron ranges from 3 to 51 kilowatt-hours, and that for open-hearth steel ranges from 19 to 31 kilowatt-hours, with even greater differences. Some of these are due to different equipment conditions, but mainly because of the unreasonable use of electricity. In the Tianjin area, due to the mismatch between the electric motors used by users and their load conditions, the power factor in Tianjin drops below 0.6 during the day, invisibly reducing the power supply capacity of the power generation and supply system by 25% and increasing the line losses by 70%, which is a very serious situation. Electricity users across the country have the responsibility to strive to reduce the waste of electricity; electricity industry workers have the responsibility to assist and supervise users in doing this work well. No neglect or underestimation should be given to this work. The amount saved by each user every day may not be that large, but it is quite considerable when accumulated. After implementing a policy of high economy for many years, the Soviet electric power industry continued its unremitting efforts in this regard, saving 150 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and 970 million kilocalories of heat throughout 1950. This is worth learning from.

　　The above practices are the correct policies for the operation of the people's electric power industry. One of the main sources of capital for the people's economic construction is to increase the internal capital accumulation of industry. Stalin emphasized in his speech at the conference of economic workers in June 1931 ("New Environment and New Tasks of Economic Construction"): In order to accelerate the capital accumulation of the national economy, "it is necessary to eliminate waste, make the most of the resources within the industry, implement and consolidate economic accounting in all our enterprises, systematically reduce costs, and strengthen internal accumulation in all, without exception, industrial sectors." This principle is completely suitable for China's current economic construction.

　　The nature of the above-mentioned work is to transform the old electric power industry into the people's new electric power industry, and to change the relationship between the old society's electric power industry and users into the relationship between the new society's electric power industry and users. This is a huge change. In the process of this change, a serious ideological struggle must be carried out with conservative ideas, local viewpoints, and anarchic conditions based on the correct principles of the operation of the people's enterprises. This is a major event that is directly related to the main electricity supply required for the country's economic construction in the next few years. This work will encounter considerable difficulties; but it must be done well, and it must be done well. Electricity industry employees across the country, industrial and other employees engaged in economic work, should fully recognize the great political and economic significance of this work, actively participate in this struggle, and strive to complete the tasks assigned by the state. The state-owned power industry has made considerable achievements in this regard in the past, and will continue to consolidate and expand existing achievements in the future; the power industries operated by provinces and cities, private power industries, and self-supplied power industries of some units have generally not carried out this work, and should now begin to promote it rapidly. Leading cadres of Party committees and People's Governments at all levels should attach importance to this work, and lead and supervise this work with appropriate forces, so that the latent potential of the people's electric power industry can be rapidly and fully developed, and the main electricity supply for the country's economic construction in the next few years can be effectively guaranteed.

### 充分发挥潜在能力是人民电业的经营方针

　　充分发挥潜在能力是人民电业的经营方针
    电力工业一年来有很大的发展。全国国营电业（指中央燃料工业部直属及委托各大行政区代管的国营电业，省营、市营电业数字未统计在内）供电系统内一九五○年用电量比一九四九年增加了百分之四十六点九；一九五一年用电量原计划比一九五○年增加百分之二十一点六；半年来实际情况证明实际用电量必然会超过这个计划。
    怎样来满足这不断增长的要求呢？有些人认为，只有大量增加发电供电的设备，才能解决。当然，要满足中国将来工业大发展的需要，不增加电力设备，是不可能的。但是，这决不是目前人民电业最主要的问题，也不是人民电业经营上的根本方针。人民电业经营的方向，应该是：不断地充分地提高效能，节约用电，以一定的合理的设备保证工业生产所需要的安全的足够的廉价的电源。目前最主要的问题，是把现有设备能力充分发挥出来，是把电力使用情况充分加以改善。一方面让大量现有的设备冻结着浪费着，而另一方面却片面地强调增添设备来增加电力，这显然是不合理的。
    中国电力工业的潜在能力大不大呢？应当说，还是很大的。我国的电力事业，过去长时期在反动政权统治下，经营情况一向很坏，生产效能一向很低，用电情况一向不合理。例如：北京、天津、唐山地区解放前设备利用率最高的一年一九四八年，利用率只有百分之三十七点四。同年，同上地区已经发出的电力在线路损失和自用电力方面就占去全部发电量的百分之四十点五四，用户中的浪费更无法计算。在中国旧的电业经营思想上，就把这种长期存在的不合理的现象认为是不可改变的事实，看不到电业的潜在能力是可以更多发挥出来的，就以为要提高供电能力只有增加设备。这种落后的守旧的思想，到解放以后仍然相当严重地存在着。解放以来，全国电业在这方面已有了一些改善。例如，北京、天津、唐山地区的电业，一九五○年和一九四八年比较，利用率提高了百分之十四点八，线路损失和自用电减少了百分之四十四。全国国营电业，一九五○年和一九四九年比较，利用率提高了百分之十三点七，线路损失和自用电减少了百分之三十点八。但情况仍然是不好的，距离应有的要求还相差很远。全国国营电业一九五○年的利用率虽然比一九四九年提高了不少，整个的利用率也才只达到百分之二十九点七；一九五○年的线路损失与自用电虽然比一九四九年降低了不少，但也还占全部发电量的百分之二十五。我们不妨拿苏联电业的尺度来量一量我们的电业：苏联一九五○年电业设备利用率是百分之七十，比我们高一倍以上；线路损失和自用电占全部发电量的百分之十二，比我们少一半还多。自然，苏联电业的某些条件我们还没有；但我国电力工业还有很大的潜在能力没有发挥出来，却是毫无疑问的。
    就全国现有电业设备的利用情况和目前时期电力的使用情况来看，保证安全的足够的廉价的电力供应的最正确的办法，是充分利用已有的设备，把潜在能力发挥到可能的最大限度；首先应该是实事求是地提高技术标准，改进管理方法，提高生产效能，节约电力消耗。根据目前的情况，如果把全国电业设备的利用率提高到百分之五十，线路损失和自用电降低到百分之十八，用户用电节约百分之十五，就可以使全国电力供应能力比一九五○年提高一倍。这样就可以节省成百万千瓦电力所需的大笔投资；并且很快就可以见效，不像新增加设备要等相当长的时间。
    这个要求能不能办到呢？只要大家努力，是完全可以办得到的。
    为着这个目的，在充分发挥发电供电设备能力方面，有以下几件事情要做：
    （一）全国电业，无论国营、私营或自用电厂，要无例外地进行定期的、彻底的、有计划的、全面的检修工作。目前全国国营、私营及自备发电设备的容量中，还有百分之二十以上（数十万千瓦）的容量，由于设备年久失修、不能互相配合等原因冻结着，不能发挥出来。其中，国营部分被冻结的容量占全部容量的百分之十六，省营、市营、私营及若干单位自备电厂，被冻结的容量占全部容量的百分之二十八点五。这还只是说的发电设备的情况。如果加上许多地区已经存在的供电设备不配合的情况，可能供给用户的电力，就要再打一个折扣。这种严重情况，不能让它继续存在下去了。国营电业一九五○年在这方面已作了许多努力，使冻结的容量由一九四九年的百分之三十三降到一九五○年的百分之十六。这一工作今后要在全国范围内各种电业中展开。
    （二）要做好地区或城市的发电供电统一调度工作。根据几个大城市的统计，它们的全部用电的最高负荷都在全部设备容量的三分之一到四分之三的范围以内。由于同一城市或地区的各个企业的电厂不是在统一的调度下联合使用，而是在分割的条件下使用，所以有些电厂（特别是某些单位自备的），有相当大量的超过需要的容量；而有些电厂（主要是国营的），反而不得不限制用户的开放。一九五○年，有些地区，如北京、天津、唐山地区，在地方政府、国营电厂的领导下，已经开始了电力统一调度的工作，并且得到了成效，打破了以往的分割的局面。但是，有些地区虽然有这样做的迫切的需要，却始终没有做好这个工作。主要的原因是，在这些企业（主要是指备有超过自己需要的容量的电力设备的企业）中的领导干部中间还存在着本位思想，强调本身的方便，缺乏对国家整个经济工作的责任感。这样做的结果，不仅危害了整体利益，浪费了国家的资源，而且它们本身的安全发电供电也得不到更好的保证。如何做好地区或城市的发电供电统一调度工作，是一个很重要的问题，今后应该尽快地解决。
    （三）要做好负荷的调整工作，使每一时期的负荷趋于平衡。根据几个大城市和电力网的统计，一九五○年它们的年负荷率最高的是百分之六十六，低的是百分之三十五，大部都是在百分之五十左右，平均数是很低的。这现象说明：我们有很大的一部分潜在力量，由于负荷有时太高，有时太低，不能充分地利用。只要我们实行适当的负荷调整制度，这些潜在力量就可以发挥出来。一九五○年年底，天津电业局在天津市财政经济委员会领导下试行了几个大工厂的负荷调整工作，对每周的负荷加以平衡，就使天津地区每天可以多出供应能力百分之五。这个例子，说明调整负荷的工作不但是应该做好，而且是能够做好的。假定最高负荷不变，我们能够把全国的平均负荷率提高百分之十，这样，电业的供应能力就提高了百分之十。
    在减少损失减少浪费方面，有以下几件事情要做：
    （一）全国电业要把自用电和线路损失降低到最低限度。一九五○年，由于全国国营电业职工的努力，与一九四九年比较，节省了电力三亿二万三千度。如果拿同年的设备利用率计算，相当于增添了一个十万千瓦容量的电厂。这个成绩是值得称赞的。这个工作在国营以外的电业系统中还没有有力地推动起来；国营电业已有的成绩也还需要进一步地提高。要充分发动工人，依靠工人，更加提高工人群众的积极性，争取使每一度电都不浪费。
    （二）电力的用户要提高对全部国家人民经济的责任感，在生产过程中，从管理上、技术上，厉行节约，减少浪费，最经济地、最合理地使用每一度电力，节省出来每一度可以节省的电力，供应其他部门以及本部门发展生产的需要。要了解，节省一度电力，就是使经济建设多一部分投资；浪费一度电力，就是使经济建设多一部分损失。根据目前各企业部门的资料，各地纺织工业每一件折二十支纱的地区平均电力消耗量是从一百七十度到二百二十度，上下相差百分之三十；生产每一吨生铁的电力消耗量是从三度到五十一度，平炉钢是十九度到三十一度，上下相差更大。其中有些是因为设备条件不同，但是主要地是因为电力使用的不合理。天津地区，由于用户使用的电动机和它的负荷情况不配合，使天津电力因数在白天降到零点六以下，无形中减低了发电供电系统供应能力的百分之二十五，加大了线路损失的百分之七十，情形很严重。全国的电力使用者，是有责任努力减少电力的浪费的；电业的工作人员是有责任协助与监督用户们做好这个工作的。对这方面的工作，不可有一点忽视或轻视。每个用户每天节约的量也许并不多么大，但积累起来也是相当可观的。苏联电业在实行了多年的高度节约政策之后，由于在这方面继续不懈地努力，一九五○年全年还节省了一亿五千万度电力，九亿七千万大卡的热量。这是值得我们学习的。
    以上这些做法，才是人民电业经营上的正确方针。人民经济建设的资本的主要来源之一就是提高工业内部的资金积累。斯大林一九三一年六月在经济工作人员会议上的演说（《新的环境和新的经济建设任务》）中曾强调指出：要想加速国民经济的资金积累，“就要消灭浪费现象，尽量动用工业内部的资源，在我们所有一切企业内施行并巩固经济核算制，有系统地减低成本费，在所有一切而无例外的工业部门里加强工业内部的积累。”这个原则，对于目前我国的经济建设是完全适合的。
    以上这些工作的性质，乃是把旧电业改造为人民的新电业，是把旧社会电业与用户的关系改变为新社会的电业与用户的关系。这是一个巨大的变革，在这变革的过程中，必然要以人民企业经营的正确原则与保守思想、局部观点、无政府状态进行严肃的思想斗争。这是与今后数年内国家经济建设所需的主要电力供应有直接关系的一件大事。这个工作会遇到相当大的困难；但是必须做好，而且一定能够做好。全国电业职工、各工业及其他从事经济工作的职工，要充分认识这工作在政治上经济上的重大意义，积极参加这个斗争，努力完成国家所给予的任务。国营电业过去在这方面已做出相当大的成绩，今后还要巩固与扩大已有的成绩；各省市经营的、私营的及有些单位自备的电业，一般地还没有进行这个工作，现在应当迅速开始推行。各级党委、人民政府领导干部，应该重视这个工作，以适当的力量领导、监督这个工作，使人民电业的潜在能力能够迅速地充分地发挥出来，使国家经济建设今后数年内主要的电力供应得到确实的保证。
