　　To the Editor:

　　Recently, we received a "Introduction to Guangdong Native Products," compiled and printed by the South China Materials Exchange Guidance Committee. In the section "Relevant Import and Export Laws and Regulations" of this book, they reprinted the "Customs Law of the People's Republic of China." After careful reading, I found that this "Customs Law" has been completely changed. The editor only reprinted Articles 20 to 145 of the Customs Law, deleting all the words "Part," "Chapter," and "Article," and treating the original Article 20 as "1.," followed by sequential numbering. More seriously, they even deleted the original Articles 114 and 119, merged Article 120 into Article 118, and rewrote the article numbers cited in the Customs Law according to the sequence in this book. Moreover, they arbitrarily added or deleted words in several places. In addition, they did not specify the issuing authority and date, which could easily lead people to misunderstand that in addition to the "Provisional Customs Law of the People's Republic of China" promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, there is another "Provisional Customs Law of the People's Republic of China." We believe that this kind of bad phenomenon of arbitrarily deleting national laws and regulations is very harmful and hope that this matter can be made public to attract the attention of the publishing industry. At the same time, we request the South China Materials Exchange Guidance Committee to correct and conduct a review.

### 华南物资交流指导委员会  不应任意把国家法令删节

　　华南物资交流指导委员会  不应任意把国家法令删节
    编辑同志：
    最近我们收到一本华南物资交流指导委员会编印的“广东土特产介绍”。在这本书的“有关出进口法令条例”这一栏内，他们翻印了“中华人民共和国海关法”。仔细阅读以后，我发现这部“海关法”已面目全非。编者只翻印了海关法第二十条至第一四五条，把篇、章、条的字样全删去，把原来的第二十条作为“一、”，以下就依次排列；更严重的是竟把原第一一四条、第一一九条都删去，把第一二○条并入第一一八条，把海关法条文中所引叙的条文数字也照这本书的排列次序改写，而且，还在好几个地方任意添减文字。此外也没有写明颁布的机关和年月日，这样，就很易使人误解，以为除了中央人民政府政务院颁布的“中华人民共和国暂行海关法”外，还有另外一部“中华人民共和国暂行海关法”。我们认为这种任意删节国家法令的恶劣现象是非常有害的，希望能将这件事加以公布，以引起出版界的注意；同时，我们要求华南物资交流指导委员会更正并进行检讨。
