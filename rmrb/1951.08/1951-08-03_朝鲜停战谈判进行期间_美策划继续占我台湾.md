Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: According to a Telepress correspondent's dispatch from Washington on July 30th: It is learned from reliable sources that, with Korea in negotiations for an armistice, the United States' top decision-making body, the "National Security Council," has been discussing the measures the United States should take regarding Taiwan for the past few days. Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Bradley, presented a report at the meeting stating that the Chiefs of Staff had discussed the possible consequences after any peaceful resolution of the Korean War, and they believed that the US Seventh Fleet must continue to hold Taiwan.

Bradley also said that American political and military figures unanimously believed that Taiwan must remain in the hands of the United States as an important base in the Far East. He stated that the United States had "successfully" used the Korean War to "isolate" Taiwan from mainland China with the Seventh Fleet, making it possible for the United States to increase its military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and send a large military delegation headed by Chase to train and control the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army.

Bradley also said that if the Seventh Fleet leaves the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan will be liberated, and it will be inconvenient for the United States to intervene again; keeping the Seventh Fleet there would allow the United States to interpret it as an "attack on American troops" and carry out armed intervention when the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberates Taiwan.

　　朝鲜停战谈判进行期间
    美策划继续占我台湾
    【新华社二日讯】据电通社记者七月三十日自华盛顿发出的消息称：自可靠方面得知，由于朝鲜已在谈判停战，美国最高决策机构“国家安全委员会”过去几日来一直在讨论美国对台湾应采取的措施。美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷在会上提出报告说，各参谋长已经讨论过在朝鲜战争获得任何和平解决的办法之后可能发生的后果，他们认为美国第七舰队必须继续把持台湾。
    布莱德雷并说，美国政界和军界人士一致相信，台湾必须留在美国手中，作为远东的一个重要基地。他表示，美国已经“成功地”利用朝鲜战争来把第七舰队使台湾与中国大陆“隔离”，这使得美国有可能增加它对蒋介石匪帮的军事援助，并派以蔡斯为首的庞大军事代表团训练和控制蒋介石匪军。
    布莱德雷又说，假若第七舰队离开台湾海峡，台湾就会被解放，美国再要干涉就不方便；把第七舰队留在那里，则当中国人民解放军解放台湾时，美国就可把它解释为“对美国军队的进攻”而进行武装干涉。
