Xinhua News Agency, London, August 10th: According to a dispatch from Dentsu News Agency in London on August 7th: Just as the United States government is demanding that Asian countries abandon all claims for reparations from Japan, the United States itself is extracting large amounts of money and materials from Japan, and using this to finance Japan's rearmament. Dentsu News Agency has learned that the British Foreign Office representative in Tokyo, in a report to the Ministry on the issue of "hidden reparations," revealed the above situation.

The information received by the British Foreign Office from Tokyo explains why the United States does not want Japan to dismantle war factories or allocate reparations. The U.S. occupation headquarters in Japan has unlimited access to all of Japan's gold and silver wealth, which is worth over $200 million. Ridgway's headquarters is using a considerable amount of this money to finance Japanese factories that manufacture military equipment, weapons, and ammunition for the U.S. military in Korea.

The Foreign Office documents show that in the first half of July alone, the U.S. military headquarters allocated a large sum of money from this wealth to several Tokyo munitions factories belonging to the "Mitsubishi" company. The U.S. military also allocated large amounts of funds from this "fund" to the following companies: "Naka-Nippon Heavy Industries Co." (manufacturing incendiary bombs), "Misaki Dockyard" (shipbuilding), and "Asano Shipbuilding" (manufacturing landing craft and aircraft carrier parts).

In the early stages of the Korean War, under MacArthur's orders, more than 80 factories originally designated for dismantling or manufacturing peacetime goods for reparations were instead used to manufacture weapons for the U.S. military in Korea and the Japanese police. The weapons produced in these factories were considered by the Americans as part of the reparations provided, and therefore were not paid for.

For example, the metal factory of "Mizuho (transliteration) Metal Company" manufactured automobile parts, boat motors, and electrical equipment for reparations last year. Now, the company supplies the U.S. military with medium and large tanks, and receives nothing in return.

The "Showa" Aircraft Factory in Mitaka manufactures 100 spare fuel tanks and bomb fuses for U.S. military aircraft every day as part of reparations. "Shibaura" Company supplies equipment for the Okinawa power plant to the U.S. military without compensation, and provides telegraph and telephone equipment for the U.S. troops stationed in Hokkaido, Japan.

### 美国为扶植日战争工业竟要各国放弃赔偿要求  许多日本工厂为侵朝美军制造武器

　　美国为扶植日战争工业竟要各国放弃赔偿要求
    许多日本工厂为侵朝美军制造武器
    【新华社十日讯】据电通社伦敦七日讯：正当美国政府要求亚洲各国放弃对日本赔偿的一切要求时，美国自己却从日本搜刮大量金钱和物资，并以此来资助日本的重新武装。电通社获悉：英国外交部驻东京代表在向该部提出关于“隐蔽的赔偿”问题报告时，透露了上述情况。
    英国外交部从东京接获的情报说明了美国为什么不要日本拆卸战争工厂，也不要日本拨付赔偿。驻日美国占领军总部可以无限制地处理日本的全部金银财富，这笔财富的价值总值超过二亿美元。李奇微总部以其中相当数量的金钱用来资助为在朝鲜的美军制造军用装备、武器和军火的日本工厂。
    外交部的文件显示：仅在本年七月份的上半月中，美军总部就从这笔财富中拨付了大批的金钱给隶属于“三菱”公司的几个东京的军火工厂。美军还从这笔“基金”中拨付大量款项给下列几个公司：“中日本重工业公司”（制造燃烧弹），“三崎船坞”（造船）和“浅野造船”（制造登陆艇和航空母舰零件）。
    在朝鲜战争的初期，根据麦克阿瑟的命令，原先规定拆卸或制造和平时期物品以供赔偿之用的工厂八十多家，改为替在朝鲜的美军和日本警察制造武器。在这些工厂中所生产的武器，被美国人认为是提供赔偿的一部分，因此并不付代价。
    例如“水尾（译音）金属公司”的金属工厂，去年曾制造汽车零件、船艇的摩托和电器装备作为赔偿。现在，该公司供给美军中型和大型的坦克，并且得不到任何代价。
    在三鹰地方的“昭和”飞机工厂，每天为美军制造飞机上所用预备油箱一百只和炸弹的导火线，作为赔偿的一部分。“芝浦”公司无代价地向美军供应冲绳岛发电厂的装备，并为美国驻在日本北海道的军队提供电报和电话的设备。
