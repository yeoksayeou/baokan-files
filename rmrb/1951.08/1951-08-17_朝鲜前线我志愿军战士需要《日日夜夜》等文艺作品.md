Reader's Letters

    To the Editorial Staff:
    There are several books needed on the Korean battlefield that cannot be purchased domestically right now. We hope publishers can quickly reprint them and supply them to Volunteer Army soldiers in large quantities. We also hope they can be printed in pocket editions. The titles of these books are:
    "Days and Nights" (complete translation)
    "Fear and Fortitude" (complete translation and rewritten version)
    "Maturity" (by Konstantin Simonov)
    And other literary works related to war.

                                  Volunteer Army Soldier on the Korean Front, Feng Rongsen

    朝鲜前线我志愿军战士需要《日日夜夜》等文艺作品编辑同志：
    朝鲜战场需要几种书，国内现在买不到，我们希望出版家能迅速翻印，大量供应志愿军部队战士阅读，并希能印成袖珍本。这些书名是：
    《日日夜夜》（全译本）
    《恐惧与无畏》（全译本和改写本）
    《成熟》（西蒙诺夫著）
    及其他有关战争的文艺作品。
