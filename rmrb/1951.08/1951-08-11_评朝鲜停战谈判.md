　　On the Korean Armistice Negotiations

The Korean armistice negotiations, which began on July 10, have taken a month. It has also been two weeks since the negotiations entered substantive discussions. In the negotiations, the U.S. side initially delayed the meeting on the pretext of the reporter issue, then refused to include the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea on the agenda, then refused to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, and then delayed the meeting again on the pretext of an accidental incident in which our guard troops mistakenly entered the conference site area. Facts have proven that the U.S. side has absolutely no sincerity in achieving a swift armistice in Korea.

The main dispute in the Korean armistice negotiations now is the issue of the military demarcation line between the two sides. Our position on the issue of the military demarcation line between the two sides is very clear: that is, the 38th parallel north latitude should be used as the military demarcation line between the two sides, and on this basis, a demilitarized zone of ten kilometers should be extended to the north and south, and the troops of both sides should be withdrawn outside the demilitarized zone. This proposition of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army not only represents the common will of the people of China and Korea, but also represents the common will of all kind people in the world who are willing to stop the Korean War.

The rationality of using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line is very obvious. (1) The 38th parallel was the original military demarcation line before the outbreak of the war caused by the invasion of the north by the Li Chengwan army. (2) The reason why the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea to assist the Korean people in combat was precisely because the U.S. invading army crossed the 38th parallel. (3) The basis of this negotiation is the suggestion made by the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, regarding the withdrawal of both sides from the 38th parallel. (4) In the course of more than a year of war, the troops of both sides have alternately entered the south and north of the 38th parallel three times, indicating that the 38th parallel fairly reflects the comparison of the military strength of the two sides. Moreover, in terms of the seven months of this year, the time our side entered the south of the 38th parallel twice was longer, and the area occupied was larger, and both times the enemy was completely driven south of the 38th parallel; the time the enemy entered the north of the 38th parallel twice was shorter, and the area occupied was smaller, and neither time was our army able to completely leave the south of the 38th parallel. (5) Even in terms of the current military position, which is not enough to reflect the comparison of the strength of the two sides, the length occupied by our side on the 38th parallel is roughly equal to the length occupied by the enemy on the 38th parallel, and the area occupied by our side south of the 38th parallel is not much different from the area occupied by the enemy north of the 38th parallel.

In fact, the rationality of using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line is so obvious that even the United States and other parties cannot but admit it for a long time. For example, in this year alone, as early as March 12, the then commander of the U.S. Eighth Army and current U.S. commander-in-chief Ridgway had already widely publicized that his highest ideal for the Korean War was to end it at the 38th parallel. Ridgway's argument was affirmed by U.S. Secretary of Defense Marshall when he testified in Congress on May 10. On May 22, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Bradley also believed in his testimony in Congress that it was necessary to prepare to end the Korean War at the 38th parallel. On May 28, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins also declared in his testimony in Congress that a ceasefire plan based on the 38th parallel should be accepted. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson stated to congressmen and reporters on June 2 and June 26 that the United States would agree to a ceasefire at the 38th parallel. As everyone knows, Acheson's second statement was after Malik's proposal. Agence France-Presse quoted Acheson as saying: "Acheson said that from a military point of view, a ceasefire at the 38th parallel is acceptable. When asked whether the 'successful conclusion' of the Korean War would be considered if the communist forces withdrew north of the 38th parallel, he replied yes." We need not list the opinions of American public opinion and American soldiers in Korea, their enthusiastic support for using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line is well known. We can fully understand from the remarks of these American military and political leaders alone that the U.S. government not only has absolutely no reason to deny the rationality of the 38th parallel, but also, no matter what kind of repeated changes have occurred in the Korean War this year, the U.S. government has absolutely no basis to believe that their military strength (of course, the combined strength of the army, navy, and air force) can maintain the position north of the 38th parallel; this is the only reason why Americans repeatedly call the use of the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line a "victory" or a "great victory."

But after the Korean armistice negotiations began, the U.S. tone suddenly changed. On July 13, Acheson suddenly and inexplicably explained the 38th parallel, which the United States agreed to as the military demarcation line, as "referring to the area where the United Nations forces are located." In the negotiation meeting, the actual plan proposed by the U.S. representative went even further than Acheson's remarks, absurdly demanding that a new military demarcation line be drawn 18 to 50 kilometers north of the existing front line of the two sides. To insist on this unreasonable demand of the United States, Joy spent the entire ten days from the tenth meeting to the nineteenth meeting arguing, fabricating various untenable "reasons" in the debate (for example, saying that the "strength" of the U.S. navy and air force's frenzied bombing must be "compensated" on the land demarcation line, and that the United States must be north of the 38th parallel to "defend" itself, etc.), and in order to make it clear, it marked out detailed maps and also, through the "News Education Bureau" of Ridgway's headquarters in Tokyo, publicly announced the U.S. position on July 31 and August 4 in the name of so-called "background materials." But a strange event then occurred. On August 3, Associated Press reporter Higson declared: "There is no evidence to prove that the United Nations forces' representatives have requested the establishment of a demarcation line north of the front line actually held by the United Nations forces." On August 4, United Nations forces official spokesman Nakos stated: "It would be completely wrong to guess that the United Nations is asking to establish any demarcation line deep into North Korea," "I believe this is a serious mistake, the most absurd guess." On August 6, the press office of Ridgway's headquarters issued another statement to "quell rumors," declaring that the demarcation line requested by the United States was roughly the current front line. Even the United Press International Tokyo dispatch on the 6th could not help but describe that this statement was "in fact completely contrary to the press releases issued to the editors of Japanese newspapers by another department of headquarters as background material."

This is the attitude of American military and political leaders towards negotiations. From March to June, they said that the 38th parallel as a demarcation line was acceptable and should be accepted and was a "huge victory." From July to August 4, they said that the 38th parallel was unacceptable, "any question of both sides withdrawing from the 38th parallel is absurd," and the "strength" of the navy and air force's frenzied bombing must be "compensated" on the land demarcation line, so the demarcation line should be north of the existing front line. On the same day, August 4, the same Ridgway headquarters said again that saying that the demarcation line should be north of the existing front line was a "rumor," a "serious mistake," and the "most absurd guess."

People all over the world, please see! The policy of deception and blackmail - this is the "sincerity" of the United States.

The soldiers of the United States, Britain, and other countries on the battlefield were ecstatic when they heard Malik's ceasefire proposal and the reply of Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai agreeing to negotiations. Ridgway said in his telegram to Generals Kim and Peng on July 3: "Because an agreement on ceasefire terms must be reached before a ceasefire, delaying the start of the meeting and reaching an agreement will prolong the war and increase losses." How much this sounds like something said by someone who wants to end the war! But what is the reality? The policy pursued by Ridgway is deception, blackmail, and deliberate delays and stalemates. This fact is now admitted even by the Americans themselves. Associated Press reporter Bradshaw explained the U.S. stalemate policy in Tokyo on the 7th: "They want to take full advantage of their advantages, while not wanting to be defeated on the propaganda front. They do not want to end the war, if a ceasefire is in favor of the communist side."

The U.S. government either believes in its imagined "advantage" in a megalomaniacal way. The delay policy of the American representatives in the negotiations seems to be merely to avoid the rainy season, so as to avoid being counterattacked and to prepare for a new offensive. But the more important reason is not in this aspect. The more important reason is that the U.S. government believes that it must maintain a state of tension in order to pass the $66.5 billion military budget bill, the $10 billion tax increase bill, and the $8.5 billion "mutual security program" "foreign aid" bill in the upcoming Congress that will close in mid-September, in order to force Britain, France, and other countries to sign a unilateral peace treaty with Japan together with the United States, which is aimed at arming Japan and the long-term occupation of Japan by the United States, and in order to ensure that American big capitalists continue to make a fortune in their activities of preparing for a new world war. The U.S. government fears peace. The Wall Street Journal recently said bluntly: "Due to the threat of peace, the profits from large-scale hoarding of materials may be lost." Marshall testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July 27 that Malik's proposal for peace in Korea "has very seriously affected our defense (?) plan." He said: "I cannot imagine that the American people would react to a Soviet statement in this way." United Press International Tokyo dispatch on June 25 said: "As long as the flames of war in Korea do not stop for a day, most countries in the Pacific will agree to a peace treaty with Japan that does not restrict Japan's rearmament. Once the Korean War ceases, their deep-rooted distrust of Japan will cause them to propose amendments that bind Japan." Because of all this, Marshall predicted as early as July 18 that negotiations on the Korean War would take more than six weeks, and later on July 30, he predicted that negotiations would still not have results in the next six weeks.

Contrary to the American warmongers, the Chinese people and the Korean people are willing to have peace, we are not afraid of peace, so we hope that the negotiations can quickly reach a ceasefire result on a fair and reasonable basis. But if the United States deliberately wants to make the negotiations fail and the war continue, then we are not afraid to continue the just war of resistance against aggression. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have full preparation and confidence in this regard. The distress of American imperialists is that although the war is profitable for them, they have already suffered enough lessons of war in Korea. They will never have the hope of victory on the Korean battlefield. American warmongers should understand that what cannot be obtained on the battlefield cannot be obtained in the negotiation hall. Deception, blackmail, delay, and stalemate, none of this can solve the problem. To solve the problem, we must abandon all this and show an honest attitude, so that the negotiations can make smoother progress than before.

### 评朝鲜停战谈判

　　评朝鲜停战谈判
    七月十日开始的朝鲜停战谈判，已经费去了一个月的时间。从谈判进入实质问题的讨论，也已经有两个星期。美国方面在谈判中始则借口记者问题延会，再则拒绝将外国军队撤出朝鲜问题列入议程，三则拒绝以三八线为双方军事分界线，四则借口我方警卫部队误入会址区的偶然事件而再度延会。事实证明，美国方面完全没有在朝鲜迅速实现停战的诚意。
    现在朝鲜停战谈判中的主要争执是双方军事分界线问题。关于双方军事分界线问题，我方的立场是十分明确的，这就是：以北纬三十八度线为双方军事分界，以此为基础向南北各伸张十公里为非军事区，双方军队都撤至非军事区以外。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的这个主张，不但代表了全中国全朝鲜的人民的共同意志，而且也代表了全世界愿意停止朝鲜战争的善良人们的共同意志。
    以三八线为军事分界线的合理是十分明显的。（一）三八线是李承晚军向北侵犯引起战争爆发前的原有的军事分界线。（二）中国人民志愿军之所以进入朝鲜援助朝鲜人民作战，正是因为美国侵略军越过了三八线。（三）这次谈判的基础，正是苏联驻联合国代表马立克关于双方撤离三八线的建议。（四）在一年多的战争中，双方军队曾经轮流地进入三八线以南和以北各三次，表明三八线是相当地反映着双方军事力量的对比的。而且，就今年的七个月来说，我方两次进入三八线以南的时间长，占的面积大，两次都把敌军完全赶过三八线以南；敌方两次进入三八线以北的时间短，占的面积小，两次都没有能使我方的军队完全离开三八线以南。（五）即以不足以反映双方力量对比的目前军事位置来说，我方在三八线上所占长度与敌方在三八线上所占长度大略相等，我方在三八线以南所占面积比敌方在三八线以北所占面积也相差无几。
    事实上，以三八线为双方军事分界线是这样合理，甚至美国各方在长期间也不能不承认。举例来说，只以今年而论，还在三月十二日，当时的美国第八军军长现任美军总司令李奇微就已大肆宣传他对于朝鲜战争的最高理想是在三八线上结束。李奇微的这个论点，在五月十日又由美国国防部长马歇尔在国会作证时加以肯定。五月二十二日，美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷在国会作证时，也认为必须准备在三八线上结束朝鲜战争。五月二十八日，美国陆军参谋长柯林斯在国会作证时，同样宣称应当接受以三八线为基础的停战方案。美国国务卿艾奇逊在六月二日和六月二十六日，对议员们和记者们先后声明美国将同意在三八线实现停战。大家知道，艾奇逊的第二次声明是在马立克的建议以后。法新社记述艾奇逊的谈话说：“艾奇逊表示，从军事观点来看，在三八线停火是可以接受的。有人问他说：共军撤到三八线以北是否算是朝鲜战争的‘胜利结束’，他回答是的。”我们无须再列举美国社会舆论和美国在朝鲜士兵的意见，他们对于以三八线为军事分界线的热烈拥护是人所共知的。我们只从美国这些军政首脑的言论中，就已经可以充分了解：美国政府不但完全没有理由否认三八线的合理，而且无论今年的朝鲜战争发生了一些怎样的反复变化，美国政府也完全没有根据相信他们的军事力量（当然是陆空海军的综合力量）可以保持三八线以北的阵地；这就是美国人再三把以三八线为军事分界称为“胜利”或“巨大胜利”的唯一原因。
    但是朝鲜停战谈判一开始以后，美国的腔调忽然变了。在七月十三日，艾奇逊忽然把美国同意作为军事分界线的三八线莫名其妙地解释为“指联合国部队所在的一带地区”。而在谈判会议上，美方代表所实际提出的方案比艾奇逊的谈话更进一步，荒谬地要求在现有双方战线以北十八公里至五十公里地方划一条新的军事分界线。乔埃为了坚持美国的这个无理要求，耗费了从第十次会议到第十九次会议的整十天的光阴来辩论，在辩论中捏造了种种不能成立的“理由”（例如说美国海空军的狂轰滥炸的“力量”必须在陆地分界线上得到“补偿”，美国必须在三八线以北才能“防御”自己等等），并且为了使人明了无误，一面标出了详细的地图，一面又经过东京的李奇微总部的“新闻教育局”以所谓“背景材料”的名义在七月三十一日和八月四日把美国的主张加以公开宣布。但是奇异的事件随即发生了。八月三日，美联社记者尤松宣称：“没有证据足以证明联合国军代表曾要求在联合国军实际据守的阵线以北建立分界线。”八月四日，联合国军官方发言人纳科斯声明：“猜测联合国要求建立任何深入北朝鲜的分界线将是完全错误的”，“我相信这是严重的错误，是最荒唐的猜想”。八月六日，李奇微总部的新闻处又发表“平息谣传”的声明，宣称美国所要求的分界线大致是现在的战线。甚至美国国新社东京六日电也不能不描写这次声明“事实上与总部另一部门作为背景材料发给日本报纸编辑的新闻稿截然相反”。
    这就是美国军政首脑对待谈判的态度。在由三月至六月间说，三八线作为分界线是可以接受应当接受的，是“巨大的胜利”。在七月直至八月四日说，三八线是不可以接受的，“双方都自三八线撤退的任何问题是荒谬的”，海空军的狂轰滥炸的“力量”必须在陆地分界线上得到“补偿”，因此分界线应当在现有战线以北。在同一个八月四日同一个李奇微总部又说，说分界线应当在现有战线以北的是“谣传”，是“严重的错误”和“最荒唐的猜想”。
    全世界的人们请看吧！欺骗和讹诈的政策——这就是美国的“诚意”。
    战场上的美英等国士兵曾经因为听到马立克的停战建议和金日成彭德怀两将军同意谈判的答复而欢欣若狂。李奇微在七月三日给金彭两将军的电文中说：“因为在停战之前须先就停战条款取得协议，所以延迟开始会晤和达成协议，将延长战事和增加损失。”这多像一个希望结束战争的人所说的话呀！但是事实上怎样呢？李奇微所奉行的政策，却是欺骗，讹诈，却是故意拖延和制造僵局。这个事实，现在连美国人自己也承认了。美联社记者勃雷德萧七日在东京解释美国的僵局政策道：“他们想要充分利用他们的优势，同时又不愿意在宣传战线上遭到失败。他们不愿结束战争，如果停火对共方有利的话。”
    美国政府或者是自大狂式地相信自己幻想中的“优势”。美国代表在谈判中的拖延政策，很像只是为着躲过雨季，以免受到反攻和准备新的进攻。但是更重要的原因，却不在这一方面。更重要的原因，是美国政府认为必须保持紧张状态，才便于在这次的将于九月中闭会的国会中通过六百六十五亿美元的军事预算案，增税一百亿美元的法案，“援外”八十五亿美元的“共同安全计划”法案，才便于强迫英法等国和美国在一起在最近签订片面的以武装日本和美国长期占领日本为目的的对日和约，才便于保证美国大资本家们继续在准备新的世界战争的活动中大发其战争财。美国政府恐惧和平。华尔街日报在不久以前曾露骨地说：“由于和平的威胁，大规模囤积物资所得的利润可能丧失。”马歇尔在七月二十七日在参院外委会作证时说：马立克关于朝鲜和平的建议“已非常严重地影响了我国防御（？）计划”。他说：“美国人民对苏联一个声明竟有这种反应，这是我所不能想像的。”合众社东京六月二十五日电说：“只要朝鲜战火一天不停，大多数太平洋国家就会赞成不限制日本重新武装的对日和约。一旦朝鲜停战，它们对日本根深蒂固的不信任，就会使他们提出束缚日本的修正案。”正因为这一切，马歇尔还在七月十八日就预料朝鲜战争的谈判需时六星期以上，后来在七月三十日，他又预料在今后六个星期中谈判还是不会有结果。
    和美国的战争贩子们相反，中国人民和朝鲜人民是愿意和平的，我们不害怕和平，所以我们希望谈判能够在公平合理的基础上，迅速达到停战的结果。但是如果美国故意要使谈判失败，使战争继续，那末，我们也不害怕继续进行抵抗侵略的正义战争。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在这一方面具有充分的准备和信心。美国帝国主义者的苦恼是：尽管战争对他们是有利可图的，但是在朝鲜，他们却已经受饱了战争的教训。他们永远没有在朝鲜战场上胜利的希望。美国战争贩子们应当懂得：在战场上得不到的东西，在谈判的会场上也不可能得到。欺骗，讹诈，拖延，僵局，这一切都是不能解决问题的。要想解决问题，就必须放弃这一切，拿出老老实实的态度来，使谈判得到比以前顺利的进展。
