Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 24th: TASS, New York, August 24th—On August 23rd, I.F. Stone in the "Compass Daily" criticized the lack of integrity of the representatives of the so-called "United Nations Forces in Korea" headquarters in the Kaesong negotiations. Stone said that just as the representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers expressed their willingness to compromise on the issue of establishing a neutral zone, the "United Nations Forces" launched an offensive on August 19th after firing the most intense artillery barrage since the start of the war. Furthermore, in the early morning of the same day, a team of armed personnel attacked a North Korean patrol in the Kaesong neutral zone, killing the patrol leader and injuring a soldier.

Stone wrote that Ridgway's response slandered the Communists, making it seem as if they were sniping at their own patrols, and rejected their accusations. This response is a new manifestation of bad faith. This is the attitude of those who attempt to cover up the crimes of themselves and their accomplices.

We can only conclude that the ambush and the new offensive are proof of reckless actions taken to immediately sabotage the negotiations when they show signs of smooth completion.

　　美国《指南针日报》载文抨击美方破坏谈判没有信义
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十四日电：八月二十三日，斯通在《指南针日报》抨击所谓“朝鲜联合国军”司令部代表在开城谈判中所采取的没有信义的态度。斯通说，正当朝鲜人民军和中国志愿军的代表们表示愿意在建立中立区问题上妥协时，“联合国军”于八月十九日在发射了战争开始以来的最猛烈炮火后发动攻势，并且在同日侵晨，一队武装人员袭击北朝鲜军队在开城中立区内的巡逻队，击毙了巡逻队长并击伤了一名兵士。
    斯通写道，李奇微的答复诬蔑共产党，把事情说成是好像他们自己狙击他们自己的巡逻队一样，并且对他们的控诉加以拒绝，这一答复是不顾信义的新的表现。这是那些企图掩盖他们自己和他们同伙的罪行的人们的态度。
    我们只能得出这样的结论：埋兵的狙击以及新的攻势都是要在谈判有顺利完成的迹象时便立刻加以破坏的轻率行动的证明。
