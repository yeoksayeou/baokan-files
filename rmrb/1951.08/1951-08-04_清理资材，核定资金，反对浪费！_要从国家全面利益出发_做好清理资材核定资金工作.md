　　Clean Up Assets, Verify Funds, Oppose Waste!
    Start from the Overall Interests of the Country, Do a Good Job in Cleaning Up Assets and Verifying Funds
    Liu Zaisheng, Director of the North China Textile Administration

    The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council issued a decision in June this year, instructing all state-owned enterprises across the country to do a good job in cleaning up assets and verifying funds before the end of this year. Here, I want to use the development of the business management of the state-owned factories in Tianjin under the North China Textile Administration to illustrate the necessity of this work.

            Pre-Liberation Enterprises Were Bureaucratic Capitalist Enterprises

    The state-owned factories in Tianjin under the North China Textile Administration were the largest bureaucratic capitalist enterprises in Tianjin during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The agents of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie in the enterprises sought excessive profits by manipulating the market and exploiting workers. At that time, there was no definite number of fixed assets and working capital in each factory; there were no institutional restrictions on the use of funds; and corruption and waste were naturally rampant.

            The Nature of Enterprises Has Fundamentally Changed Since Liberation

    After liberation, the nature of the enterprises underwent fundamental changes. Relying on the conscious labor of the vast number of workers, on the one hand, production rapidly exceeded the levels during the Japanese occupation and Kuomintang rule through production competitions; on the other hand, an anti-waste movement was launched, assets were inventoried and registered, and a unified management system for mechanical and electrical materials (materials such as parts and oils consumed in the process of manufacturing machine products) and a pre-budget and final accounting system for cash expenditures were established. At this time, the business management was processing-oriented and centralized, that is, the North China Textile Administration signed processing contracts with the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company based on fixed exchange ratios of raw cotton and yarn and cloth, and fixed processing fees. The products of each factory were uniformly handed over to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company by the Administration, and raw cotton was supplied to the Administration by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, and uniformly distributed to each factory by the Administration. In terms of mechanical and electrical materials and other expenses, the Administration uniformly controlled them through a pre-budget and final accounting system. This business management system yielded some gains when the local economic situation was not stable enough and the general factory managers were not familiar enough with the business. For example, the signing of processing contracts allowed factory managers to focus on production management; the unified management of mechanical and electrical materials and the establishment of a pre-budget and final accounting system gave us a preliminary understanding of the storage, use, and cash revenue and expenditure of mechanical and electrical materials, and reduced the accumulation and waste of funds to some extent.

            The Development of Production Requires Further Improvement of the System

    However, with the development of production, the current business management system has obviously become an obstacle to further improvement of production. Because the assets and funds occupied by the factory have nothing to do with the factory manager, and because the factory's profit and loss have nothing to do with the factory itself, the factory management cadres have neglected business management. Therefore, the efficiency of factory equipment cannot be fully utilized, and the phenomenon of working capital accumulation and waste is still very serious.

            The Efficiency of Factory Equipment Cannot Be Fully Utilized

    In terms of fixed assets, because only a general inventory and registration were carried out in the past, and no careful verification was carried out based on the efficiency of the equipment, the production potential of the factory could not be further exploited. For example, the number of revolutions of machines often varies greatly in the same workshop and the same type of machine. But no one cares about this phenomenon. The stoppage rate of machines is also often very high. The efficiency of the looms in some factories is less than 93%, while it can actually reach more than 95%. Stoppages in the workshop also occur frequently. From April 20 to 24, the roving workshop of Tianjin State-owned Cotton Spinning Factory No. 2 stopped 167 times.

            The Phenomenon of Working Capital Accumulation and Waste Is Serious

    The phenomenon of working capital accumulation and waste is very serious. Under the processing-oriented business management system, the supply of raw cotton and the amount of inventory have nothing to do with the factory's working capital. Therefore, factory managers do not pay attention to saving raw materials, which account for about 90% of the cost; they also do not pay attention to reducing the accumulation of raw materials and semi-finished products. Therefore, the phenomenon of raw materials and semi-finished product accumulation and waste continues to occur in various factories. In the past, the accumulation of semi-finished products in some factories often reached tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of pounds. In the spring of this year, due to insufficient water content in the original yarn, the monthly yarn loss was as high as 12 pieces. Secondly, in terms of mechanical and electrical materials, due to unified management, factories tend to use good products when using mechanical and electrical materials. Although there are many low-quality mechanical and electrical materials in stock, they are unwilling to use them and want to buy new ones. Some factories have the idea of "being generous in budgeting and strict in using," trying to increase the budget as much as possible and accumulating materials in case of emergency. For example, only 700 hook knives are needed every month, but the budget is for 2,000, and the actual inventory is still 2,000. The red bricks purchased in 1949 were not officially used until 1951. As a result, a large number of stagnant materials were piled up in the warehouse; after being piled up for a long time, some became waste materials. At present, most of the materials in stock are cold materials (although they were cleaned up last year, they were not processed and handed over), and it is estimated that the total value accounts for about one-half of the entire working capital of mechanical and electrical materials. The monthly consumption of mechanical and electrical materials in some factories is less than one-tenth of the total stock. From this, it can be seen how serious the accumulation of funds is. In the past, Tianjin State-owned Cotton Spinning Factory No. 2 had such a thing: the budget for office expenses was more than 90 million yuan, and the approved amount was more than 30 million yuan; but in fact, the factory's warehouse had a large number of office supplies available. At present, although the factories have been able to spend according to the monetary revenue and expenditure plan, the plan is still often made for "getting money." At the end of the month, if there is any surplus, they always try to find ways to spend it. Therefore, the phenomenon of waste in the use of cash is still serious.

    Not long ago, when we were studying how the textile machinery factory could operate independently, we found that the factory often accumulated materials worth 28 billion yuan from January to April this year, of which cold materials accounted for about 9 billion yuan. The total stock is enough for 14 months. The factory also often accumulated more than 15 billion yuan of semi-finished products.

            These Wasteful Phenomena Must Be Thoroughly Corrected

    From the facts listed above, although we cannot fully see the total amount of accumulated and wasted working capital, we can already see that this accumulation and waste has caused great losses to the country.

    At present, the country needs factories to accelerate their internal accumulation, and needs to concentrate a large amount of funds to engage in national-scale economic construction and national defense construction. Although the potential capacity of our factories has been initially developed, we still need to rely on all employees to fully utilize the efficiency of the equipment to seek a higher level of production. The phenomenon of wasting state assets must be thoroughly corrected. In order to correct this phenomenon, we must first seriously, not perfunctorily, do a good job in cleaning up assets and verifying funds.

    Starting from the overall interests of the country, carefully calculating and striving to maximize the utilization rate of existing equipment, and minimizing the amount and turnover rate of working capital, so that the country can transfer surplus equipment and funds to useful places, this will not only pave the way for the implementation of economic accounting in factories, but also will surely enable the country's economic construction and national defense construction to be better developed.

　　清理资材，核定资金，反对浪费！
    要从国家全面利益出发
    做好清理资材核定资金工作
    华北纺织管理局局长  刘再生
    政务院财政经济委员会今年六月发布了一个决定，指示全国国营企业要在今年年底以前，作好清理资产核定资金工作。在这里，我要就华北纺织管理局天津各国营工厂经营管理的发展情况，来说明这个工作的必要性。
            解放前是官僚资本主义企业
    华北纺织管理局天津各国营工厂，在国民党反动统治时期，是天津市最大的官僚资本主义企业。官僚资产阶级在企业中的代理人，以操纵市场和压榨工人的手段，来谋取超额的利润。当时，各厂到底有多少固定资产、多少流动资金，完全没有一个确实数目；资金的使用没有任何制度的限制；贪污浪费现象自然是不在话下。
            解放后企业性质根本改变了
    解放以后，企业性质有了根本的变化。依靠广大职工自觉的劳动，一方面，通过生产竞赛，使生产迅速超过了日寇和国民党统治时期的水平；一方面，开展了反浪费运动，进行了资产的清点和登记，建立了机物料（在机器制造产品的过程中所消耗的零件、油类等物资）统一管理制度和现金开支的预决算制度。在这个时候，经营管理是加工性的、集中性的，即按固定的原棉、纱布的交换比例，和固定的加工费用，华北纺织管理局与花纱布公司订立了加工合同。各厂产品由管理局统一缴给花纱布公司，原棉由花纱布公司供给管理局，由局统一分配各厂。在机物料及其他开支上，则是以预决算制度的方式，由局统一掌握。这种经营管理制度，在当地经济情况还不够稳定，和一般工厂管理者对业务还不够熟悉的时候，是有一些收获的。比如加工合同的订立，使工厂管理者得以专心管理生产；机物料的统一管理和预决算制度的建立，使我们心中对机物料的储存、使用情况和现金收支情况，初步地有了数，并且在某种程度上减少了资金的积压和浪费。
            生产的发展要求制度更加改进
    但是，随着生产的发展，目前这样的经营管理制度已显然地成为生产进一步提高的障碍。由于工厂占有的资产和资金与工厂管理者不发生什么关系，由于工厂经营的盈亏与工厂本身没有关系，这样就使得工厂管理干部忽视了经营管理。因此，工厂的设备效能不能充分发挥，流动资金积压与浪费的现象也仍然很严重。
            工厂设备效能不能充分发挥
    在固定资产方面，由于过去只一般地进行了清点和登记，而没有根据设备效能仔细地进行核定，因此使工厂的生产潜力不能得到进一步的发挥。比如机器的回转数，在同一车间同一类型的机器中，往往上下相差很多。但这种现象却没有人过问。机器的休止率也往往很大，有的厂布机的效能尚不足百分之九十三，实际可达百分之九十五以上。车间内停车现象也经常发生，在四月二十至二十四日，天津国营棉纺二厂粗纱间即停车一百六十七次。
            流动资金积压浪费现象严重
    流动资金积压与浪费的现象是非常严重的。在加工性的经营管理制度下，原棉的供应以及库存数量的多少，与工厂的流动资金不发生关系，因此工厂管理者对于占成本百分之九十左右的原料的节约，未加重视；对于减少原料和在制品的积压，也不重视。因而各厂原料、在制品积压与浪费的现象就不断出现。过去有的厂在制品的积压往往达数万磅以至十几万磅以上。今年春季，由于原纱含水不足，每月亏纱达十二件之多。其次，在机物料方面，由于统一管理，厂内在使用机物料时，争用好货。虽然库存很多质量较差的机物料，却不愿用，而要重新购买。有的工厂有着“宽打窄用”的思想，尽量增加预算，积存物料，以备万一。如钩刀每月只需七百把，却预算为二千把，实际库存仍有两千把。一九四九年购买的红砖，到一九五一年才正式使用。这样，就使仓库堆积大批呆滞材料；堆积久了，有些就成为废料。目前库存材料中大部为冷料（去年虽曾清理过，但未处理上缴），估计总值约占整个机物料流动资金的二分之一左右。有些工厂机物料的每月用量不足总存量的十分之一。由此可见，资金的积压是多么的严重。过去天津国营棉纺二厂曾有这样的事：办公用费预算为九千多万元，核准为三千多万元；但实际上，该厂库内却存有大批办公用具可用。目前各厂虽已作到按货币收支计划开支，但计划仍常常是为“领钱”而作。月底有些余款，总是竭力设法支用。因此，在现金使用上的浪费现象，仍然是严重的。
    不久以前，我们在研究纺织机械厂如何独立经营时，发现该厂今年一至四月间经常积压价值二百八十亿元的材料，其中冷料约合九十亿元。总存量足够十四个月用。该厂积压在制品，也经常在一百五十亿以上。
            这些浪费现象必须彻底纠正
    从以上所列举的事实来看，虽然我们还不能完全看出关于积压与浪费流动资金的总数，但已可看到这种积压与浪费现象已经使国家遭受了很大损失。
    目前，国家正需要工厂加速其内部积累，需要集中大量资金去从事全国规模的经济建设与国防建设。我们工厂的潜在能力虽已初步发挥，但还需要依靠全体职工充分发挥设备效能，以寻求更高的生产水平。浪费国家资财的现象，必须彻底纠正。为了纠正这种现象，首先就必须认真地而不是敷衍地，作好清理资产与核定资金的工作。
    从国家全面利益出发，精打细算，力求发挥现有设备的利用率，尽量把流动资金的数额与周转率减至最小限度，使国家把多余的设备和资金转用到有用的地方，这不仅将为工厂实行经济核算制铺平道路，而且必将使全国的经济建设和国防建设得到更好的发展。
