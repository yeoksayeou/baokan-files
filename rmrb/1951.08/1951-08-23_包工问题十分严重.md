Title: The Problem of Contracting Out is Very Serious

　　The problem of contracting out in capital construction is one of the major problems in the current national economic construction. In constructing a new factory, construction engineering accounts for about one-half, and general construction is basically construction engineering. This shows that more than half of the state's total investment in capital construction is used in construction, and currently, construction engineering mainly relies on free contracting. Therefore, if there are problems in contracting out, it will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the completion of capital construction tasks.

  I. There are rather serious problems in the current contracting out.

　　According to an investigation report on the capital construction of a factory last year, there are serious unreasonable situations in contracting out. More than 95 percent of the factory's entire construction project relies on external contracting, and the contractors include state-owned construction companies, private construction companies, and large and small contractors and feudal foremen. The problems are as follows:

　　1. Contractors generally seek only profit, disregarding the quality of the project.

　　The state is making great efforts to carry out construction, but it has not yet mastered sufficient construction forces, and it has not even concentrated and effectively managed private construction enterprises. As a result, private construction companies, design companies, etc., have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. Many state organs are also establishing construction companies, some of which are their responsibility and should be done, while others are for "organ production." Most private construction industries still follow the bad habits of the old society, engaging in speculation and trickery, and only seeking profit. Some state-owned companies, aiming at "production," naturally also prioritize "making money first." As such, there is no guarantee of project quality. When contracting projects, competition is fierce, leading to extreme chaos in the construction industry.

　　2. Layer-by-layer subcontracting, speculation, and profiteering.

　　"Subcontracting" is a bad habit of the old society, even becoming a system, and it is still being followed. Subcontracting once or twice is considered normal, with some going up to three or five times. Private merchants do this as usual, without needing to give examples, and some state-owned companies also do this. For example, a state-owned company contracted an earthwork project at a certain factory for 12 jin of millet per cubic meter, and subcontracted it to a certain foreman for 2.5 jin of millet per cubic meter. Another example is that a hospital project of the same factory contracted by a state-owned company was subcontracted to small contractors Li and Xin, and the company deducted 13 percent of the original contract price.

　　3. Feudal foremen super-economically exploit construction workers.

　　The above-mentioned subcontracting is essentially a disguised foreman system. When it is contracted to a veritable foreman, another deduction is made, so the wages received by the workers are actually very little. After receiving their wages (and even receiving wages is not timely), workers still have to give "gifts" to the foreman, otherwise they will have no work to do.

　　4. Unscrupulous means, bribery becomes commonplace.

　　Since there is a great profit to be made from contracting projects, and there is free competition (in the form of bidding), large and small contractors, and even some state-owned companies, go to great lengths to curry favor in order to secure the contract. Treating people to dinner is nothing, giving gifts and borrowing money (which is actually giving without expecting repayment) are also common occurrences. There are even those who use gambling as a means of disguised bribery, with wins and losses in the hundreds of thousands. If the contractor loses, they pay; if they win, they don't accept, and the other party is only responsible for the wins and not the losses. Some staff members who were originally of poor quality were bought off, and some individual veteran cadres also degenerated due to temptation. As a result, the project is contracted to those who offer bribes, and the contract price is also raised. A certain contractor said triumphantly, "This time the contract price is good. So-and-so is capable and a good person!"

　　Contractors with the above behaviors all adopt the methods of cutting corners and changing materials to achieve their profit-making goals. In the above-mentioned hospital project, for example, only the four sides were laid when laying the foundation, and the four corners were not, resulting in uneven softness and hardness of the foundation. Inferior and small materials were used instead of good and large materials, such as using bad bricks instead of good bricks, and five-inch wood instead of seven-inch wood, etc. There are also phenomena such as increasing brick seams when砌墙 (qi qiang) and incomplete grouting. The specific bad consequences are wasting state materials and threatening the safety of capital construction.

  II. The main reasons for the formation of the problem

　　We believe that the reasons for the above phenomena are mainly in two aspects: system and ideology.

　　System aspect: First, the continuation of the old system: (1) The bidding system is a capitalist system, a system of free competition. Since it is free competition, whoever has more tricks can get the contract, leading to all kinds of malpractices, and it is not necessarily the one who can really do the job well who gets the contract. Many of our comrades lack experience in this regard and are easily deceived. This system promotes the chaotic establishment of companies, creating blindness in the development of the construction industry. (2) The subcontracting system is a direct cause of cutting corners and reducing project quality. Since there is layer-by-layer subcontracting, each layer must be able to make money. All layers above the bottom layer rely on speculation and profiteering, while the bottom layer can only make money by cutting corners and exploiting workers. Second, we lack sound working systems, such as a responsibility system for supervisors and a material management system (some projects are contracted out with materials provided by the contractor, in which case the contractor does not reduce materials, but uses large materials for small purposes and wastes materials very seriously), giving contractors opportunities to take advantage of loopholes.

　　Ideological aspect: Many private companies and contractors basically still have the ideology and style of the old society. They have not yet realized how they should treat the affairs of the people's country in the new democratic society. Some state-owned companies (that is, state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature) also value making money over tasks, indicating that the backward ideology of the bourgeoisie has invaded some state-owned enterprises, losing their due leadership role over private enterprises. In addition, a small number of cadres have unhealthy thoughts and unstable principles, leading to being seduced by contractors, which in essence helps the illegal activities of contractors.

  III. Suggestions for improvement

　　1. Organize the construction industry.

　　According to the proportion of investment used by the construction industry, and its impact and role in national economic construction, a department should be established within the Central People's Government to organize construction enterprises, unify guidance for their work, and manage the following main businesses: (1) Manage building materials (except for metal materials), industrial plans and policies, and unified quality standards and specifications. (2) Lead state-owned construction enterprises, and consider reorganizing existing decentralized state-owned construction companies into a systematic state-owned construction company (headquarters and branch companies), which can be under dual leadership (central construction department and local government), and fix its capital equipment and personnel. (3) Appropriately organize private construction enterprises, control and guide their business activities through task allocation, and review their operational capabilities. Those who engage in speculation and profiteering without operational capabilities should be banned. (4) Train technical personnel in a planned way. (5) Gradually formulate standard designs.

　　2. Gradually abolish the bidding system and adopt the task allocation system.

　　Start with state-owned construction enterprises first. And take construction areas (such as industrial and mining areas and large cities) as units, and the local construction enterprise management agency (or the local state-owned construction company), in conjunction with various capital construction departments, should uniformly plan the annual construction task allocation plan, and organize various private companies to complete it accordingly, to ensure their reasonable profits.

　　3. Abolish the subcontracting system.

　　After the above measures, the evil habit of subcontracting has been restricted, but it must be explicitly abolished. Anyone who undertakes a project must have the ability to complete the project and is not allowed to subcontract. If one company does not have enough ability, it should jointly undertake the project. "Subcontracting" should be listed as an illegal act.

　　4. Gradually stabilize construction workers.

　　This is a way to eliminate the foreman system organizationally. The capital construction department of a certain ministry has already started in this direction and has achieved results. For example, properly organize workers, pay wages directly, ensure they have work to do, and appropriately take care of their welfare. In this way, foremen have no opportunities to take advantage of, and some have already left on their own, and the enthusiasm of workers has been greatly improved. With the stabilization of workers, trade union organizations can also be soundly established. According to the total amount of national construction and future development, it is very necessary to take steps to fix workers. Otherwise, this construction army will continue to be in an unorganized state and subject to super-economic exploitation, which makes it impossible to rely on the working class in the construction industry.

　　The above points are suggestions for long-term solutions to the problem, which need to be started in a timely manner and should not be delayed any longer. However, this work is a huge organizational work and cannot be completed in the short term. In order to strive for greater guarantees for construction projects during the transition period, the following points should be noted:

　　1. Set a good contracting contract and strictly fulfill the contract. Some of our comrades do not pay enough attention to the role of the contract, and regard the review and signing of the contract as a general responsibility procedure, without making good use of this weapon. Therefore, the requirements for the content of the contract are not strict enough, which gives unscrupulous contractors an opportunity to take advantage of loopholes. For example, some contracts lack specific guarantees for quality. The so-called "no leaks in three years, no collapse in five years, and a 20-year guarantee" is actually empty talk, and there are no specific solutions to problems. The lack of seriousness of the contract is one of the reasons for contractors cutting corners. This is mainly because we do not have enough experience. We should study and summarize the existing experience to improve future work.

　　2. Strengthen the training of supervisory personnel, and improve the supervisory system and various responsibility systems. "Supervision" is an important link to ensure project quality. Supervisory personnel need to have a high degree of responsibility and necessary engineering knowledge. Some comrades are very hardworking and have good work results, while some comrades are very responsible but not very good at discovering problems, and are sometimes deceived. It is recommended that departments that continue to carry out construction seize the gap this winter, organize necessary training, summarize past practical work, and improve their knowledge. At the same time, improve the supervisory responsibility system, material management system, and work reporting and inspection system, and project acceptance system, etc.

　　3. Focus on inspecting and sanctioning illegal merchants who take bribes to eliminate bad practices. Appropriate measures should also be taken to deal with and educate individual corrupt cadres.

　　The construction enterprise is one of the important departments of the country and should be quickly mastered to ensure that national construction suffers less or no losses.

　　包工问题十分严重
        陈志军
    基本建设中的包工问题，是目前国家经济建设中的重大问题之一。建设一个新工厂，建筑工程要占二分之一左右，而一般性的建设，则基本上是建筑工程。这说明国家对基本建设的全部投资，有半数以上是用在建筑方面的，而目前进行建筑工程还主要靠自由包工。因此，如果包工中有问题，无疑将对基本建设任务的完成发生重大影响。
  一、目前包工中有相当严重的问题
    根据去年某工厂基本建设的调查报告，包工中有严重的不合理情况。该厂全部建筑工程，百分之九十五以上靠外包工，包工者有公营建筑公司，私营建筑公司以及大小包商和封建把头。问题有以下几点：
    １、包工者普遍地惟利是图，不顾工程质量。
    国家正用大力进行建设，但尚未掌握足够的进行建筑的力量，即对私营的建筑企业亦未能集中和有效的管理，因之，私营的建筑公司，设计公司等如雨后春笋般应时而生。而不少国家机关也在成立建筑公司了，有的是职责所在，应当办，有的则是为了“机关生产”。许多私营建筑业，大抵还沿袭着旧社会的恶习，投机取巧，惟利是图，而某些公营公司，既以“生产”为目的，自然也就以“赚钱第一”。如此，对工程的质量就无保障。在承包工程时，你争我夺把建筑业弄得极为混乱。
    ２、层层转包，投机倒把。
    “转包”，是旧社会的恶习，甚至成为制度，目前依然沿袭。转包一次两次者视为平常，有多至三次五次者。私商是照例这样办的，不必例举，而有的公营公司也这样办了，例如：某公营公司，以每方工资十二斤小米包到某厂一项土方工程，而以每方二斤半小米转包给某包工头。另如公营某公司包到同一工厂的医院工程，转包给小包商李某和辛某，该公司抽去原包价的百分之十三。
    ３、封建把头，超经济地剥削着建筑工人。
    上述转包，实质上是变相的把头制，等到包到名符其实的把头手里，自然又克扣一次，于是发到工人手里的工资实在无几了。工人领了工资（领工资也不是及时的），还得给包工头送“礼”，不然，就没活干。
    ４、不择手段，贿赂成风。
    承包工程，既然有大利可图，且可自由竞争（方式即投标），于是大小包商以至某些公营公司，就大事拉拢以谋包成。请客吃饭不算什么，送东西，借钱（有借无还其实是送），也是平常的事情，竟至有以赌钱办法而变相行贿者，输赢百十万，包商输则给钱，赢了不收，对方则管赢不管输。有些原来品质就不好的工作人员被收买了，而个别老干部也因诱惑而蜕化，于是工程包给行贿者了，而且包价也提高了，包商某人洋洋自得说“这回包价不错，某人能干，是好人！”
    有上述行为的包工者，都采取偷工减料与换料的办法达其赚钱目的，上述医院工程，即有：打地基时只打四边，四角未打，致地基软硬不一。以劣料小料代好料大料，如以坏砖代好砖，五寸木料代七寸木料等等。砌墙加大砖缝，灌浆不满等现象。其具体恶果则是浪费国家的资材，威胁基本建设的安全。
  二、问题形成的主要原因
    形成上述现象的原因，我们认为主要是制度和思想两个方面。
    制度方面：首先是旧制度的沿袭：（一）投标制，是资本主义的制度，是自由竞争的制度。既是自由竞赛，谁的办法多谁就能包到手，流弊百出，而不一定是谁真能做好才由谁包，我们许多同志对此尚缺乏经验易受其欺骗。这一制度促成乱设公司，造成建筑业发展的盲目性。（二）转包制，是造成偷工减料，降低工程质量的直接原因。既然层层转包，必是层层均可赚钱，末层以上各层靠投机倒把，而最末一层则只有靠偷工减料和剥削工人来赚钱了。其次我们缺乏健全的工作制度。如监工责任制度及材料管理制度（有的工程是包工自料，这时包工者却不是减料了，而是大料小用，与多要少用，浪费甚为严重），使包者有机可乘。
    思想方面。许多私营公司和包商，基本上还是旧社会的思想和作风，他们还没有认识到在新民主主义社会中，应当怎样对待人民国家的事情。有的公营公司（即是社会主义性质的国家企业）也不重任务而重赚钱，说明资产阶级的落后思想已侵入某些国家企业中，失掉自己对私营企业应有的领导作用。另有少数干部，思想不够健康，掌握原则不稳，致被包商引诱，其结果是在实质上助长了包商的不法活动。
  三、对改进的建议
    １、把建筑业组织起来。
    按照建筑业使用投资的比重，及对国家经济建设的影响和作用，应当在中央人民政府内设立一个部门，把建筑企业组织起来，统一指导其工作，并可掌管以下主要业务：（一）掌管建筑材料（金属材料可除外），工业之计划与方针，及统一质量标准和规格。（二）领导公营建筑企业，并考虑以现有分散的公营建筑公司为基础，加以组织调整，组成系统的公营建筑公司（总公司和分公司），此类企业可受双重领导（中央建筑部门和当地政府），固定其资本设备和人员。（三）把私营建筑企业加以适当的组织，通过任务分配来控制和指导其业务活动，并审定其作业能力，凡属无作业实力而进行投机倒把行为者应予取缔。（四）有计划地培养技术人员。（五）逐步制定标准设计。
    ２、逐步废除投标制，采用任务分配制。
    首先从公营建筑企业做起。并以建设地区（如工矿区和大城市）为单位，由当地建筑企业管理机构（或即由当地公营建筑公司），结合各基本建设部门，统一规划年度建筑任务的分配方案，据此组织各私营公司完成，保证其合理的利润。
    ３、废除转包制。
    在上述措施后，转包恶习已受限制，但还须明令取消，凡承受一项工程者必需有完成该项工程之能力，不准转包，一家能力不足则联合承办，“转包”应列为非法之行为。
    ４、建筑工人逐步固定化。
    这是在组织上消除把头制的办法。某部基本建设部门已开始了这个方向，并已获得成绩。如把工人适当的组织，直接发工资，保证他们有工做，适当照顾其福利。如此，把头无机可乘，有的已经自己溜了，而工人的积极性已大大提高。随着工人的固定化，工会组织也才能健全和建立。按照国家建设的总量及今后的发展，十分必要采取固定工人的步骤了，否则这一支建设大军将继续处于无组织状态之中，并受着超经济的剥削，这就不可能在建筑业中依靠工人阶级。
    以上几点是属于长久性解决问题的意见，需要及时着手而不宜再迟。但此项工作是一巨大的组织工作，非短期内所能完成。为了在过渡期间，争取对建筑工程的更大保证，以下几点应当注意：
    １．定好包工合同，严格履行合同。我们有些同志对合同的作用还不够重视，对合同的审查和签署，视为一般履行的责任手续，没有很好运用这个武器，因而对合同内容的要求不够严格，这就给不法包商以可乘之机。例如，有的合同中对质量缺乏具体的保证，所谓“三年不漏，五年不塌，保固二十年”，其实是空话，而且出了问题，也没有具体的处理办法。合同的不够严肃，是包商偷工减料的一个原因。这一点主要由于我们经验还不多，应就已有的经验加以研究和总结，以改进今后工作。
    ２．加强训练监工人员，健全监工制度及各种责任制度。“监工”是保证工程质量的重要环节。监工人员需要有高度的负责态度，及必要的工程知识。有些同志是很努力而且工作成绩很好，有些同志虽然很负责但却不太会发现问题，有时即被蒙蔽。建议在继续进行建设的部门抓紧今冬空隙，组织必要的训练，就过去的实际工作加以总结，并提高其知识，同时健全监工责任制度，材料管理制度，及工作的汇报与检查制度和工程验收制度等。
    ３．对采取行贿的不法商人，应予重点检查和制裁，以杜绝恶风。对于个别腐化的干部亦应适当处理和进行教育。
    建筑企业，是国家重要部门之一，应当迅速掌握起来，保证国家建设少受以至不受损失。
