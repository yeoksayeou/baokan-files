Hasty Start Due to Impatience, Lack of Economic Accounting System
Liaodong Province Suffered Significant Waste in Capital Construction Last Year
This Year, the Provincial Department of Industry Has Learned Its Lesson and is Proceeding Cautiously

The capital construction of state-owned enterprises in Liaodong Province in 1950, under the direct leadership of the Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Government, developed some resources and prepared conditions for production in 1951 due to the correct policies and timely guidance. However, due to a lack of experience, the initial compilation of the 1950 capital construction plan did not involve meticulous consideration and research into various necessary conditions, but rather stemmed from a subjective desire to rapidly develop various factories and mines. As a result, the capital construction work had a significant degree of blindness and risk-taking, leading to many shortcomings and errors. These shortcomings and errors are manifested in the following aspects:

	Construction Started Lightly Without Considering Various Specific Issues in Capital Construction

Many factories and mines did not adequately consider new equipment, changes in ore deposits, technical conditions, funding sources, material supply, and organizational capacity before starting construction. There was a subjective desire to complete many capital construction projects in a short period, resulting in many projects not being completed on schedule and a large amount of capital being tied up. Several major capital construction projects in 1950 were not completed on schedule. The Jiaoziyu Talc Mine project of the Haicheng Mine was originally planned to be completed in March, but due to water in the vertical shaft, the plan was revised, and the complete drainage equipment was not completed until August. Due to repeated rework during machine installation, it did not officially start drainage until November 28, affecting talc production. The Railway Zishi Mian Mine was delayed by three months, and the Qinggouzi Mine was delayed by two months in completing all the asbestos fiber separation equipment projects. Due to the equipment not being completed on schedule, 10,000 tons of raw ore were accumulated by the end of 1950.

	Rough Design and Surveying, Even Construction Before Design, Resulting in Rework and Waste

The vast majority of capital construction projects in Liaodong Province in 1950 were not carried out in accordance with the procedures stipulated by the state. Many projects lacked detailed design and construction charts, and many projects were "construction before design" or "excavating transport tunnels before surveying." The waste from this is incalculable.

The Weishahe, Tongyuanbao, and Huangdi asbestos mines all began building transport tunnels without thorough prior surveys, without knowing the quality of the asbestos, its use value, and transportation conditions. The Weishahe Mine took only three months from geological exploration to construction and production. Due to the poor quality of the raw asbestos fiber and lack of sales, work was forced to stop midway. Tongyuanbao and Huangdi were also forced to stop work one after another for the same reason. When the Yantai Coal Mine was opened, the exploration work was insufficient, and there were no past detailed geological maps. After half a year of opening the Dayu Pit, it was discovered that there were many faults, making it difficult to mine, and it was forced to stop work at the end of the year (with an investment of more than 7 billion). In addition, construction was carried out blindly before the production policy was determined. The newly opened Dongqi Pit was forced to stop construction after seven months of building transport tunnels because it was determined that coal production should be reduced. The Asbestos Factory built a large factory building of more than 2,500 square meters without determining what products to produce. After the construction was completed, it was still unknown what machines to install and what products to produce.

	Slack Supervision and Inspection, Poor Engineering Quality

Another result of the leading cadres' eagerness for quick results was slack supervision and inspection. There was a lack of quality standards, supervision systems, project acceptance methods, and material receipt procedures during the project's progress. Many factories and mines considered it "all is well" after contracting the project to a civil engineering company, believing that "whether the task is completed is the responsibility of the civil engineering company." The civil engineering company, on the other hand, simply pursued profits and did not adequately recognize the important significance of capital construction, resulting in poor quality of many projects and significant waste. For example, the roof of the newly built factory building in the Asbestos Factory was tiled without applying mud. The Qinggouzi Mine factory building was crooked, and the roof leaked. The walls of the foundry workshop of the Machinery Factory were built crooked and had to be reworked. The capital construction departments of factories and mines did not understand technology, lacked experience, and did not supervise, inspect, and accept the projects well. Some construction supervisors raised objections, and the contractors considered it "nitpicking" and "finding fault," resulting in a conflict between the contractors and the supervisory personnel of the capital construction departments of the factories and mines.

The lack of technical personnel for construction and supervision in civil engineering companies was also a reason for poor engineering quality, rework, and waste. Some site supervisors also had to manage material receipt and issuance, and even clerks were in charge of supervision.

	Lack of Economic Accounting in Capital Construction

Capital construction belongs to state investment, with neither the task of turning over profits and depreciation, nor a strict cost supervision system. Although most factories and mines have capital construction institutions, they lack statistics, accounting, and record-keeping personnel, coupled with inaccurate designs and incomplete plans. The "actual reimbursement" supply system is still quite common.

Without an accurate record-keeping and statistical system, it is impossible to obtain accurate project costs and labor and material quotas. The pre-budget and final account system has not been well implemented. Many factories and mines are "overestimating and underutilizing," or "using the money for soy sauce to buy vinegar." For example, when the Mining Company needed to build a small building, fearing that the budget would not be approved, they included this expense in the investment amount for the magnesite crushing plant's capital construction. Some factories and mines reported expenses that could not be reimbursed for production in the capital construction expenses. Waste occurred in the project, and it was reported and reimbursed as is, disrupting the budget. Waste in raw material supply was also significant. For example, the red bricks required for the capital construction project of the Qinggouzi Mine could have been solved locally, but due to a lack of investigation and research, the civil engineering company was entrusted to purchase them and transport them from Tonghua to the site, wasting a total of 220 million. The construction of the factory building of the Xisan Factory was suspended for more than 20 days due to the lack of wood processing and supply.

Because of the lack of record-keeping and statistical systems and strict material receipt and issuance systems and custody procedures, the consumption of bricks, tiles, wood, and stone, and the use of labor, are unclear. Unit project quotas, labor efficiency, and project costs cannot be calculated. This is also one of the important lessons in capital construction in 1950.

	Learning Lessons and Cautiously Determining This Year's Policy

The Liaodong Provincial Department of Industry has learned from the lessons of the capital construction work in 1950 and paid attention to the following issues in the capital construction project in 1951:

First, based on the investment capacity and production needs of Liaodong Province, priorities were determined, and the capital construction policy was carefully determined: In order to ensure project quality and avoid rework and waste, this year's capital construction must be carried out according to design charts, and the erroneous practices of "construction before design" and "excavating transport tunnels before surveying" must be resolutely corrected.

Secondly, the responsibility system must be thoroughly implemented, and the contract system must be strengthened. In capital construction, project progress, project quality, and raw material supply must be the responsibility of certain departments and specific personnel. Factories and mines must sign contracts with contractors, specifying quality standards, supervision tasks, project acceptance, inspection methods, and so on in the contract.

Thirdly, factories and mines and engineering companies must thoroughly implement the economic accounting system in capital construction. Determine the funding of the engineering company, formulate and implement quota management and various cost plans, and determine reasonable profit rates and design fees.

### 急于求成草率动工，没有经济核算制度  辽东省去年基本建设浪费很大  今年该省工业厅已接受教训慎重从事

　　急于求成草率动工，没有经济核算制度
    辽东省去年基本建设浪费很大
    今年该省工业厅已接受教训慎重从事
    辽东省省营企业一九五○年的基本建设，在中共省委和省人民政府直接领导下，由于方针正确、指导及时，开发了一些资源，为一九五一年的生产准备了条件。但是由于缺乏经验，编制一九五○年基本建设计划之初，没有缜密地考虑与研究各种必要的条件，只是从热心于各厂矿发展的主观愿望出发，因而基本建设工作带有很大的盲目性和冒险性，发生了许多缺点和错误。这些缺点和错误表现在以下各方面：
    没有考虑基本建设中的各种具体问题就轻易动工
    许多厂矿企业在动工修建前，没有很好地考虑新增设备、矿床变化、技术条件、资金来源、材料供应与组织能力等，主观要求在很短期间搞好很多基本建设工程，以致许多工程不能如期完成，积压了大量资金。一九五○年基本建设工程较大的几项都没按期完成。海矿的窖子峪滑石矿井工程，原计划三月完成，后因竖井出水，修改计划，到八月尚未把全部排水设备搞好。由于安装机器多次返工，一直拖到十一月二十八日才开始正式排水，影响了滑石的生产。铁路子石绵矿延迟了三个月，青沟子矿延迟了二个月才把解绵设备工程全部做完。由于设备没有按期完成，以致一九五○年底积压原石一万吨。
            设计勘查粗糙甚至先施工后设计，造成返工浪费
    辽东省一九五○年绝大部分的基本建设工程，没有按照国家规定的程序来进行。许多工程缺乏设计施工详细图表，许多工程是“先施工后设计”，或者是先建筑送道（运输的巷道）后测量。这样的浪费是难以计算的。
    苇纱河、通远堡、荒地等石绵矿都是事前没有周密的勘查，不知道石绵质量的好坏、使用价值及交通运输条件，即行建筑送道。苇纱河矿，从地质勘查到施工生产仅三个月，由于原绵质量差，没有销路，中途被迫停工。通远堡、荒地也以同样原因先后被迫停工。烟台煤矿在开坑时，由于没有探矿，勘查工作不够，没有过去的地质详图，大玉坑开坑半年后发现断层多，不易开采，年底被迫停工（已投资七十多亿）。另外，生产方针尚未确定，就盲目进行建设，新开的东七坑，因确定煤炭减产，建筑送道七个月，被迫停开。石绵厂还没有确定生产什么产品，就建筑了二千五百余平方公尺的大厂房，建筑完了还不知道要按装什么机器，生产什么产品。
            监工检查不严，工程质量低劣
    领导干部急于求成的另一个结果是监工检查不严，工程进行中缺少质量标准、监工制度、工程验收办法、物料领收等手续。许多厂矿将工程包给土木公司后便认为“万事大吉”，“完不完成任务是土木公司的事”。而土木公司则单纯追逐利润，对基本建设的重要意义认识不足，以致许多工程质量低劣，浪费很大。如石绵厂新建的厂房，房顶不抹泥就上瓦。青沟子矿厂房歪斜，房盖漏雨。机械厂翻砂厂房的墙修歪了，不得不返工。厂矿的基本建设部门不懂技术，缺乏经验，又不很好地监工、检查、验收。有些工程监工员提出意见，施工者认为是“找岔子”、“挑毛病”，结果，施工者与厂矿基本建设部门的监工人员形成对立。
    土木公司缺乏施工、监工的技术人员，也是造成工程质量低劣返工浪费的原因。有些现厂监工人员还要代管材料收发，甚至有事务员代管监工的。
            基本建设中缺乏经济核算
    基本建设属于国家投资，既无上缴利润和折旧任务，又缺乏成本的严格监督制度。大部厂矿虽设有基本建设机构，但缺乏统计、会计、记录人员，加上设计不准确、计划不周密；“实报实销”的供给制作法还相当普遍。
    没有准确的记录统计制度，就不可能得出准确的工程成本和工料定额。预决算制度也没有很好地贯彻。很多厂矿是“宽打窄用”，“买酱油的钱打了醋”。如矿业公司需要建筑一座小楼，怕批不准预算，竟把这笔费用打在苦土粉碎厂的基本建设的投资额里。有的厂矿把生产上不能报销的款项放在基本建设费用里报销。工程中发生了浪费，就实报实销，打乱预算。原材料供应上的浪费也很大。如青沟子矿基本建设工程所需红砖，本来在当地可以解决，但因缺乏调查研究，委托土木公司代买，从通化运到现场，共浪费二亿二千万元。细三厂建厂房时因木料加工供应不上，中途停工二十多天。
    因为缺乏记录统计制度和严格的物料收发制度和保管手续，砖、瓦、木石的消耗和人工的使用，都弄不清用到什么地方了。单位工程定额、人工效率、工程成本更无法计算。这也是一九五○年基本建设中的重要教训之一。
            接受教训慎重确定今年方针
    辽东省工业厅接受了一九五○年基本建设工作的教训，在一九五一年的基本建设工程中，注意了以下问题：
    首先根据辽东省投资力量和生产需要，分出轻重缓急，慎重确定基本建设方针：为了保证工程质量避免返工浪费，今年的基本建设必须按设计图表施工，坚决纠正“先施工，后设计”，“先送道后测量”的错误作法。
    其次，要彻底实行责任制，加强合同制。在基本建设中工程进度、工程质量、原材料供应等，都须有一定部门和专人负责。厂矿与施工者必须签订合同，在合同中规定质量标准，监工任务，工程验收，检查办法等。
    第三、厂矿与工程公司在基本建设上必须贯彻实行经济核算制。确定工程公司资金，制定与实行定额管理和各种成本计划，确定合理利润率和设计费。
