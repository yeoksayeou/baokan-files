Promote Economic Prosperity in Minority Areas: Southwest China Establishes State Trading Agencies
    State-owned trading sectors in Southwest China are actively carrying out trade in ethnic minority regions to boost economic growth. As of now, 184 state-owned trading agencies and over 100 consignment stores have been established, with 274 ethnic minority cadres joining the state-owned trading companies.

    In conducting trade with ethnic minorities, state-owned trading departments in Southwest China have vigorously promoted local and special products from these regions while actively supplying essential goods. The sales channels for native products from ethnic minority areas have now opened up. For instance, around 90% of the local and special products from the Yi areas in Southern Sichuan have been sold. State-owned trading companies have also made every effort to purchase many items that had been stockpiled for years. The prices of local and special products in various ethnic minority regions have generally been appropriately increased. The prices of some fast-selling goods have even exceeded the highest levels during the Anti-Japanese War. The favorable treatment in purchasing and pricing by state-owned trading companies has stimulated production in various ethnic minority regions. Last year, the amount of wool transported from Tibetan areas in Xikang to the interior more than doubled compared to 1949 before liberation. Some ethnic minority regions that previously widely cultivated opium have now switched to growing crops and local specialty products.

    In order to overcome the transportation difficulties of goods in ethnic minority regions, the people's governments at all levels in Southwest China have built many highways and post roads in ethnic minority areas over the past year, such as the highway from Guanxian to Maoxian in Western Sichuan, the highway from Yibin to Tangba (under Junlian County) in Southern Sichuan, and the road from Pingwu to Jiangyou in Northern Sichuan. The people's governments of Xikang, Guizhou, Southern Sichuan and other places have made full use of navigable rivers. The Guizhou Provincial People's Government organized postal transportation, renovated the main roads throughout the province, and formed a transportation network extending to various ethnic minority areas. The Yunnan Provincial People's Government has universally organized packhorses in the ethnic minority mountainous areas.

    In addition, trade departments in various parts of Southwest China have begun to assist people of all ethnic groups in establishing primary markets. The Guizhou Provincial People's Government has also guided the people of all ethnic groups in establishing cooperatives.

    With the development of trade, the lives of ethnic minorities in Southwest China have improved initially. According to statistics from the Industry and Commerce Department of the Southern Sichuan People's Administrative Office, from January to May this year alone, the daily-use industrial products sold to the Yi areas from Leibo, Mabian, and Ebian counties have reached the average annual level of goods sold during the Anti-Japanese War. The supply of salt to ethnic minorities in Guizhou and Yunnan and the supply of tea to Tibetans in Xikang have now been resolved.

Northwest Ethnic Minority Areas Send Mobile Trade Teams Deep into Pastoral Areas
    Trade work in ethnic minority areas of Northwest China has gradually been spreading into herding regions and tents. The ethnic minority areas of Northwest China are vast and sparsely populated, and many places do not yet have the conditions for establishing markets. It takes many days for herders to travel to and from urban markets for trading. In order to develop trade in pastoral areas, state-owned trading companies in Ashan, Yili, Tacheng, Yanqi, and other places in Xinjiang Province organized more than 60 mobile trade teams last autumn to conduct transactions deep in herders' tents. This year, state-owned trading companies in other regions of the province and in Qinghai Province, as well as Wuwei and Dunhuang in Gansu Province, have adopted this method more widely. The Guoluo area trade team organized by the Dulan County state-owned trading company in Qinghai Province sent more than 500 yaks at one time, carrying daily necessities worth more than 300,000 catties of wool. Since the start of mobile trade work in ethnic minority areas, the business of state-owned trading companies has developed rapidly. In the first half of this year, the Qinghai Provincial Trading Company has completed 55% of its annual purchase plan and more than 58% of its sales target. The mobile trade team sent by the Wuwei Trading Company in Gansu Province has completed its annual plan for purchasing hides and skins.

    At the same time, state-owned trading companies in various places have mostly jointly organized mobile trade teams with private merchants, or have signed contracts with private merchants, entrusting them to organize trade teams independently. State-owned trading companies hold forums before private merchants depart to help them understand the ethnic policies of the people's government, stipulate reasonable prices, and give private merchants reasonable profits. In this way, state-owned trading companies have united private merchants, reduced the exploitation of ethnic minorities by private merchants, and promoted ethnic unity. In some places, the mobile trade teams have also cooperated with the people's government's tax and medical and health work, with great results.

    In some places with relatively good economic conditions, the activities of the mobile trade teams of state-owned trading companies have directly promoted the establishment of markets. In Tumuxiuke in the third district of Wensu County, Xinjiang Province, the previously deserted place has become a trading center due to the many transactions conducted by the mobile trade team sent by the county's trading company. Every time the trade team arrives, herders within dozens of miles ride horses to trade. A fixed market has now been established in the area.

Guangxi Province Organizes Mobile Purchasing and Marketing Groups to Go Deep into Remote Ethnic Minority Areas
    Guangxi Province has established trade organizations in remote areas inhabited by ethnic minorities and has organized mobile purchasing and marketing groups to supply them with the materials they lack most, such as salt, matches, needles, thread, and homespun cloth. At the same time, their production income has increased rapidly. For example, in the past, each dan (a unit of dry measure) of tea oil in Shaliu Village, Liujiangzhai could only be exchanged for 80 catties of salt or one strand of cotton yarn. After the purchasing and marketing group arrived, it could be exchanged for 300 catties of salt or three strands of cotton yarn. In Tian Dong Qiliwei, 16 catties of rice used to be exchanged for 1 catty of salt, but after the purchasing and marketing group arrived, 2,000-3,000 yuan could buy 1 catty of salt. In Jinxiu Yao Mountain, 1 catty of shiitake mushrooms used to be exchanged for 2.5 catties of salt or 3 packages of matches, but after the trade company expanded its business, it could be exchanged for 4 catties of salt or 4 packages of matches.

    From this, it can be seen that only when the work of material exchange is done well can the economic life of ethnic minorities be improved. Only today, when the people hold power, can ethnic minorities establish free and equal trade relations with all parts of the country.

　　改善少数民族的经济生活！
  西南各少数民族地区大量建立国营贸易机构
    西南区国营贸易部门积极开展少数民族地区的贸易工作，以促进少数民族地区生产的发展。到目前为止，西南各少数民族地区已建立了一百八十四个国营贸易机构，一百多个代销店，并吸收了二百七十四名少数民族干部参加国营贸易公司的工作。
    西南各地国营贸易部门在开展少数民族贸易工作中，曾大力推销少数民族地区的土、特产品，积极供应必需品。少数民族地区土产销路现已打开。如川南区彝民区土、特产，百分之九十左右已经销出。许多积压了多年的物品，国营贸易公司也都尽可能收购。各少数民族地区的土、特产价格，一般都已适当提高。部分畅销货且已超过抗日战争时期的最高水平。国营贸易公司在收购和价格上的照顾，刺激了各少数民族地区的生产。西康藏民地区去年输往内地的羊毛，比解放前一九四九年增加一倍以上。过去遍种鸦片的一些少数民族地区，现已纷纷改种农作物和土、特产。
    西南区各地人民政府为了克服少数民族地区物资调运的交通困难，一年多来在少数民族地区修筑了许多公路和驿道，如川西灌县到茂县的公路、川南宜宾到塘坝（筠连县属）的公路、川北平武到江油的大道等。西康、贵州、川南等地人民政府，对各地能够通航的河道都已加以利用。贵州省人民政府组织了驿运，整修了全省大道，组成了深入各少数民族地区的交通网。云南省人民政府在少数民族山区普遍进行了驮马的组织工作。
    此外，西南各地贸易部门并已开始协助各族人民建立初级市场。贵州省人民政府并指导各族人民建立了合作社。
    随着贸易工作的开展，西南区少数民族的生活已经初步改善。据川南人民行政公署工商厅统计，从今年一月到五月，仅从雷波、马边、峨边三县销往彝民地区的日用工业品，已达抗日战争期间每年销进物品平均总值的水平。贵州、云南少数民族的食盐和西康藏民的茶叶供应问题，现在都已解决。

  西北少数民族地区流动贸易队深入牧区
    西北少数民族地区贸易工作已逐渐在深入牧区帐篷展开。西北少数民族地区地广人稀，很多地方还没有具备建立集市的条件，牧民到城镇集市交易，往返要很多天。为发展牧区贸易，新疆省阿山、伊犁、塔城、焉耆等地国营贸易公司去秋曾组织六十多个流动贸易小组，深入牧民帐棚交易。今年该省其他地区和青海省、甘肃省武威、敦煌等地国营贸易公司，更广泛采用了这个办法。青海省都兰县国营贸易公司组织的果洛区贸易队，一次就派出牦牛五百多头，驮载的日用品折值羊毛三十多万斤。少数民族地区流动贸易工作开展以来，国营贸易公司的业务迅速发展。今年上半年，青海省贸易公司已完成全年收购计划的百分之五十五，完成推销任务百分之五十八以上；甘肃省武威贸易公司派出的流动贸易小组收购皮张已完成全年计划。
    同时，各地国营贸易公司大都联合私商共同组织流动贸易组，或者和私商订立合同，委托他们单独组织贸易队。国营贸易公司在私商出发前召开座谈会，帮助私商了解人民政府的民族政策，规定合理价格，给私商以合理利润。这样，国营贸易公司团结了私商，减轻了私商对少数民族的剥削，促进了民族团结。有些地方的流动贸易小组还和人民政府的税收、医药卫生工作配合进行，收效很大。
    有些经济条件比较好的地方，国营贸易公司流动贸易组的活动直接促成了集市的建立。新疆省温宿县第三区吐木休克，由于该县贸易公司派出的流动贸易组到该地进行了多次交易，冷落的地方变成了交易中心。每次贸易小组一到，几十里内的牧民都骑马赶来交易。该地现已设立了固定集市。

  广西省组织流动购销组深入少数民族偏僻地区
    广西省在少数民族的偏僻地区，设立了贸易机构，并组织了流动购销组，供应他们最感缺乏的盐、火柴、针、线、土布等物资，同时使得他们的生产收入迅速提高。如榴江寨沙圩过去每担茶油仅换盐八十斤或棉纱一股，自购销组到后，就可换盐三百斤或棉纱三股了；田东七里圩以前十六斤米换一斤盐，购销组到后，二、三千元就能买到一斤盐了；金秀徭山冬菇一斤从前换盐二斤半或火柴三包，自贸易公司展开业务后，就可换盐四斤或火柴四包了。
    由此可见，只有物资交流工作作好了，少数民族的经济生活才能提高一步。也只有在人民掌握政权的今天，少数民族才能和全国各地建立自由的平等的贸易关系。
