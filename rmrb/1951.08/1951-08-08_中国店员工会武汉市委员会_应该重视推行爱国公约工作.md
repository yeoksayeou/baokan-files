To the Editor:

The widespread promotion of patriotic pacts is an extremely important political task for the people of the whole country today. However, the leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of our Chinese Store Employees' Union does not attach enough importance to this matter.

Around the "May 1st" Labor Day, the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions issued a draft of the city's workers' patriotic pact and instructed it to be distributed to grassroots trade unions for discussion. Later, the Store Employees' Union drafted a city-wide store employees' patriotic pact. At that time, the Standing Committee casually discussed it and printed it for distribution to the grassroots trade unions; however, it did not specifically study how to organize forces to deeply mobilize city store employees to discuss and study this patriotic pact. Therefore, after the draft of the patriotic pact was distributed, there was little response. Only one or two grassroots trade unions in the city offered opinions, and the Municipal Store Employees' Union Committee did not pay attention to inspection, so the matter ended without a conclusion.

In mid-May, Comrade Li Ziyi, Minister of Culture and Education of the Store Employees' Union Committee, returned from a meeting in Beijing and actively proposed the importance of the patriotic pact to the leadership. At that time, cadres of the organization were launching the "Loyalty and Honesty Movement," and the matter of the patriotic pact was put aside again. It was not until June 1st, after the China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association issued a call to promote patriotic pacts, that Comrade Li Ziyi proposed it again to the leading comrades. Comrade Zhang Xuezhong, Chairman of the Committee, said: "The establishment of patriotic pacts should be focused on key areas." But until mid-July, the Standing Committee had neither researched nor discussed, nor organized cadres to go deep into the lower levels to provide specific assistance. It only dispatched two cadres from the Culture and Education Department to inspect the situation of two stores' employees in establishing patriotic pacts. The Wuhan Municipal Store Employees' Union's leadership's neglect of the work of promoting patriotic pacts is very wrong, and it is hoped that they will quickly correct it and earnestly lead the city's store employees in establishing patriotic pacts.

### 中国店员工会武汉市委员会  应该重视推行爱国公约工作

   中国店员工会武汉市委员会
   应该重视推行爱国公约工作编辑同志：
    普遍推行爱国公约是今天全国人民极为重要的一项政治任务。但是我们中国店员工会武汉市委员会领导上对这件事却很不重视。
    “五一”劳动节前后，武汉市总工会就发下来全市工人爱国公约的草案，并指示把这个公约草案发到各基层工会讨论。后来，店员工会又起草了一个全市店员爱国公约草案。当时常委会随便讨论了一下，就印发到各基层工会；却没有具体研究如何组织力量，深入发动全市店员讨论研究这个爱国公约。因此，爱国公约草案发下去后，很少反应，全市只有一两个基层工会提了意见，而市店员工会委员会也未注意检查，这件事情就此没有下文了。
    五月中，店员工会委员会文教部长李子仪同志自北京开会回来后，就积极向领导上提出爱国公约的重要性，当时机关干部正展开忠诚老实运动，爱国公约的事又被搁下了。直到六月一日中国人民抗美援朝总会发出推行爱国公约的号召后，李子仪同志又向领导同志提出，委员会主席张学忠同志说：“订立爱国公约应该有重点地搞。”但直到七月中旬，常委会既未研究讨论，亦未组织干部深入下层具体帮助进行，只是由文教部派出两个干部，去检查两家商店店员订立爱国公约的情形。武汉市店员工会领导上如此忽视推行爱国公约的工作是非常错误的，希望他们迅速改正，认真领导全市店员订立爱国公约。
