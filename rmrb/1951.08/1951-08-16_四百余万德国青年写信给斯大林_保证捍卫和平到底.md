Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 15th. According to TASS, Over four million, one hundred and fourteen thousand, five hundred and thirty-nine German youths jointly signed a letter to Marshal Stalin, reporting to him that over one million German youths had gathered in Berlin to hold the Youth Peace Fighters' Congress against rearmament and for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951. The letter guarantees that German youth will defend peace to the end.

The letter lists the various efforts made by German youth to defend peace during the preparation for the Third World Youth and Students Peace Festival. The letter states: During the preparation for the festival, the Free German Youth League launched a "Salute to the Great Stalin" campaign to develop new members. In this movement, 390,583 young men and women and teenagers joined the Free German Youth League and the Young Pioneers; 1,056,998 young people studied "Foundations of Leninism" and have already applied what they have learned to their daily propaganda work. The youth in the state-owned industrial and agricultural sectors of Democratic Germany overfulfilled the plan by 6,200,9195 workdays in this movement, making a significant contribution to the completion of the Five-Year Plan.

The letter points out that the youth of West Germany, together with all progressive forces in West Germany, are fighting shoulder to shoulder for peace, against American imperialism and resurgent German imperialism, and against McCloy, Adenauer, and Schumacher's use of German youth as cannon fodder for aggressive wars. Although the Bonn "government" has adopted persecutory measures such as banning the activities of the Free German Youth, the progressive youth of West Germany still stand at the forefront of the struggle. The letter says: "The serious situation of the entry of American and British troops into West Germany and the open adoption of remilitarization measures by the imperialist forces compels us to redouble our efforts to eliminate the danger of war and ensure peace."

The letter to Stalin concludes: "Dear Joseph Stalin, we assure you that under the leadership of the German Socialist Unity Party, the vanguard of the German people, and under the leadership of our beloved President Wilhelm Pieck, we are determined to defend peace to the end!"

　　四百余万德国青年写信给斯大林
    保证捍卫和平到底
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林十四日讯：四百一十四万五千八百三十九个德国青年共同署名写了一封信给斯大林大元帅，向他报告：一百余万德国青年已齐集柏林，举行了反对重新武装和争取在一九五一年缔结对德和约的青年和平战士大会。信中保证：德国青年将保卫和平到底。
    信中列举德国青年在筹备第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节期间为保卫和平而作的种种努力，该信说：自由德国青年联盟在准备联欢节期间，发动了“向伟大的斯大林致敬”的发展新盟员运动。在这个运动中，有三十九万零五百八十三名男女青年和少年参加了自由德国青年联盟和少年先锋队；有一百零五万六千九百九十八个青年学习了“论列宁主义基础”，并且已经把他们所学到的知识实际应用到他们所正在进行的日常的宣传鼓动工作中。民主德国国营工业和农业部门中的青年，在这次运动中超额完成了六百二十万零九千一百九十五个工作日的计划，对完成五年计划作了巨大的贡献。
    信中指出：西德的青年和西德的一切进步力量在一起，正在并肩地为争取和平，反对美帝国主义和死灰复燃的德帝国主义，反对麦克洛埃、阿登纳和舒马赫利用德国青年充当侵略战争的炮灰而斗争，虽然波恩“政府”采取了禁止自由德国青年活动这种迫害手段，但是，西德的进步青年仍然站在斗争的前列。信中说：“美英军队进入西德和帝国主义力量公然采取重新军国主义化措施的严重局面，迫使我们不得不加倍努力，来消灭战争危险并确保和平。”
    给斯大林的信最后说：“亲爱的约瑟夫·斯大林，我们向你保证，我们在德国人民的先锋队、德国统一社会党的领导下，在我们敬爱的威廉·皮克总统的领导下，决心保卫和平到底！”
