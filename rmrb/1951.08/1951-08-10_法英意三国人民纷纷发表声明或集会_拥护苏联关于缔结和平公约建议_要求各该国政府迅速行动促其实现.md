　　The people of France, Britain, and Italy have issued statements or held gatherings in support of the Soviet Union's proposal for a peace pact.
Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The people of France, Britain, and Italy have expressed their support for the Soviet Union's proposal, put forward by Nikolai Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, in his reply to US President Truman, regarding a peace pact among the five major powers. According to a report from Teletype News Agency: The French Peace Council issued a statement on the 8th, saying: "The issue of a five-power peace pact has been raised among governments. Today, France is on the front lines of the Cold War and is in danger of becoming a major battlefield in a world war. It should play a decisive role in facilitating these negotiations. The French government should make a significant contribution to the cause of peace, which is closely related to our national interests, in these negotiations."
    The secretary of the British pacifist organization "Peace Pledge Union," Maurice, commented on Shvernik's proposal on the evening of the 7th, saying: "Rejecting Shvernik's proposal is to make war inevitable. I hope this proposal can be realized immediately, and I hope that Britain and the United States will quickly respond with agreement to the Soviet proposal." Burley, the head of the British Quaker delegation that recently visited the Soviet Union, also issued a statement supporting Shvernik's peace proposal.
    Working people throughout Italy have held gatherings to express their support for Shvernik's proposal. Workers at the "Ansaldo" shipyard in Livorno have passed a resolution demanding that the parliament take swift action to realize the Soviet peace proposal. Residents of Grand Lanardo City, after hearing the radio broadcast of Shvernik's proposal, held a mass meeting in the square, and within an hour, 1,200 people signed the World Peace Council's declaration on a five-power peace pact. Workers at the city's arsenal, naval shipyard, and "San Giorgio" machinery factory also held grand gatherings in support of Shvernik's peace proposal.

　　法英意三国人民纷纷发表声明或集会
    拥护苏联关于缔结和平公约建议
    要求各该国政府迅速行动促其实现
    【新华社九日讯】法、英、意三国人民拥护苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克给美国总统杜鲁门的复信中提出的关于五大国缔结和平公约的建议。据电通社消息：法国和平理事会于八日发表声明说：“缔结五大国和平公约的问题已经在政府之间提出来了。今天法国是冷战中的前哨，而且有成为世界大战中主要战场的危险。它应该在促成这个谈判中起决定的作用。法国政府在这次谈判中应对和我们民族利益有非常密切关系的和平事业作重大的贡献。”
    英国非战主义团体“和平保障同盟”秘书莫里斯于七日晚发表谈话，评论什维尔尼克的建议说：“如果拒绝什维尔尼克的建议，就是要使战争不可避免。我希望这项建议能够立刻实现，并希望英美两国对苏联的建议迅速作出同意的答复。”最近访问苏联的英国教友派代表团团长伯莱，也发表声明拥护什维尔尼克的和平建议。
    意大利各地劳动人民纷纷举行集会，表示拥护什维尔尼克的建议。里窝那“安莎尔多”造船厂工人已通过决议，要求议会迅速采取行动以实现苏联的和平建议。大兰多城的居民在听到电台广播什维尔尼克的建议后，就在广场上举行群众大会，在一小时内就有一千二百人在世界和平理事会关于五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签了名。这个城市的兵工厂、海军造船厂和“圣·乔治”机械厂的工人也举行了盛大集会，拥护什维尔尼克的和平建议。
