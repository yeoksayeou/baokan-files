Shandong Huimin Prefecture
Excessive Concurrent Positions of Village-Level Cadres Affect Production
Relevant Leading Organs Should Immediately Find Ways to Correct This

To the Editor:

    According to my understanding in Huimin Prefecture, Shandong, the phenomenon of excessive concurrent positions held by grassroots cadres of the Communist Youth League is very serious, which affects their production and learning. The relevant organs should immediately find ways to correct this situation.

    Chen Xiurong (female), secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in Zhaolou Village, Chenhu District, Boxing County, also serves as a member of the Communist Youth League township general branch, director of the village entertainment committee, member of the Party branch, member of the cooperative, member of the production committee, director of the Women's Federation, and leader of the textile group. She was also elected as a representative to the county's People's Congress, Party Congress, Communist Youth League Congress, Youth Congress, and Women's Congress. In Guan Yan Village, Yanfang District of the same county, two Communist Youth League branch members hold six and five positions, respectively. It is a common phenomenon for Communist Youth League branch secretaries and some members to hold two or three positions concurrently. Some Communist Youth League cadres sometimes attend meetings for more than 20 days a month, which seriously affects production. Many parents are very dissatisfied with this.

    This situation of excessive concurrent positions is also very detrimental to the work. Some Communist Youth League members hold many jobs, but they cannot do any of them well. Some counties and districts have proposed to solve this problem, but it has not been resolved so far. The main reason is that some leading cadres have erroneous departmentalism; they all say that these cadres belong to their own organizations and no one wants to let them go.

    I suggest that the relevant local leading organs pay attention to this problem and be determined to solve it.

    Editor's Note: The phenomenon of excessive concurrent positions of village-level cadres in Huimin Prefecture, Shandong, affecting production and work is indeed serious. The reason for this phenomenon is certainly related to the departmentalism of some cadres; however, this phenomenon is mainly due to the local leading organs neglecting the training and promotion of cadres. Therefore, the local leading organs should strengthen the education of the masses and promote cadres in practical work.

　　山东惠民专区
    村级干部兼职过多影响生产
    有关领导机关应即设法纠正编辑同志：
    据我在山东惠民专区了解，当地青年团的基层干部兼职过多的现象很严重，因而影响了他们的生产和学习。这种情况，有关机关应即设法纠正。
    博兴县陈户区赵楼村青年团支部书记陈秀荣（女），身兼青年团乡总支委员、村文娱委员会主任、党支部委员、合作社委员、生产委员会委员、妇联主任、纺织组长等职，并被选为县各界人民代表会议、党代表会议、团代表会议、青年代表会议、妇女代表会议的代表，同县阎坊区关阎村二个团支部委员，一个身兼六职，一个身兼五职。团支部书记和某些委员身兼二、三职是很普遍的现象。有些团的干部，有时一个月开二十多天会议，严重地影响了生产。很多家长对此很不满意。
    这种兼职过多的情况，对工作也是非常不利的。有些团员兼了很多工作，反而那一件工作也做不好。有的县、区曾提出要解决这个问题，但至今仍没解决。其主要原因是某些领导干部有着错误的本位思想，他们都说这些干部是属本组织的，谁也不愿放。
    我建议当地有关领导机关重视这个问题，并下决心把它解决。

    编者按：山东惠民专区村级干部兼职过多，影响生产，影响工作的现象，确实是严重的。所以造成这种现象，固然和某些干部的本位思想有关系；但此种现象主要的是由于当地领导机关忽视培养、提拔干部所致。因此，当地领导机关要加强对群众的教育，在实际工作中提拔干部。
