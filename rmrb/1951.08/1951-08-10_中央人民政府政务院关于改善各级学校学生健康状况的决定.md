The current state of poor health among students at all levels of schools across the country is quite serious. In many schools, students' physical health has been affected due to excessive homework, too many extracurricular activities, inadequate food management, and insufficient attention to hygiene. This situation must be changed. It should be pointed out that improving students' physical health is one of the major tasks to ensure that students complete their learning tasks and cultivate modern youth with strong physiques. The education administrative departments of people's governments at all levels and the faculty and staff of schools at all levels must pay serious attention to this issue, immediately correct the thinking of neglecting students' health and the irresponsible attitude towards students' health, and effectively improve the health of students at all levels of schools. To this end, the following decisions are made:

	I. Adjust the daily learning and living time of students:
	1. The daily class and self-study time of students (including experiments in colleges and universities and secondary schools): colleges and universities and senior secondary schools shall not exceed nine hours; junior secondary schools shall not exceed eight hours; and senior grades of primary schools shall not exceed six hours (including breaks between classes).
	2. The daily sleep time of students: colleges and universities are stipulated to have eight hours; secondary schools, nine hours; and primary schools, ten hours. Increase nap time appropriately in summer.
	3. The daily sports, entertainment activities or productive labor time of students: in addition to physical education classes and morning exercises or recess activities, the principle is one hour to one and a half hours. Boarding students can reduce it appropriately. When students engage in productive labor, they should avoid excessive physical labor.

	II. Reduce the burden of students' academic studies and extracurricular activities:
	1. Schools at all levels should follow the regulations of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government to delete repetitive and unnecessary courses and teaching materials, and improve teaching methods. Teachers should focus on classroom teaching, explain clearly so that students understand thoroughly; do more exercises in the classroom, do not give students too much homework and unnecessary difficult exercises; do not deliberately give obscure test questions during exams; and unify and reasonably allocate time for experiments, self-study and other extracurricular assignments. Teachers of all subjects should complete and teach the courses well within the allocated time, and correct and prevent any tendencies such as initiating any rushes, competitions, or forcing the pace.
	2. Students should regard learning as their primary task. Therefore, schools at all levels should reasonably guide students' extracurricular activities, effectively reduce the number and time of meetings, and appropriately allocate time for various extracurricular activities. When students participate in mass parades, attention should be paid to their physical strength. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government should, in conjunction with the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Students' Federation, formulate practical and effective specific measures to reduce students' extracurricular activities inside and outside the school, and limit the time students spend attending community meetings, not exceeding three hours per week per person in colleges and universities and senior secondary schools; not exceeding two hours per week per person in junior secondary schools; and not exceeding one and a half hours per week per person in primary schools. The meeting time for persons in charge of the community shall not exceed twice the above regulations. Administrative aspects of schools at all levels and relevant parties such as the Youth League and the Student Union should abide by these regulations and measures, and schedule the daily agenda of various meetings and community activities on a monthly basis, which shall be passed by the principal's meeting and strictly implemented as a system, and should be regularly checked by the school's administrative aspects, the Youth League, and the Student Union. Student community meetings should be fully prepared, and some meetings can be held jointly. Schools at all levels must resolutely overcome the tendency of multiple leadership and overlapping organizations in school community activities. Students who work in student communities should hold one position per person in principle, and those who must hold concurrent positions can only hold two positions at most.

	III. Improve school hygiene work:
	The education administrative departments of people's governments of each province, city, and county should, together with the hygiene administrative departments at the same level, the education trade union, the Youth League, the Student Federation, and representatives of local medical institutions, organize a school health guidance committee to be responsible for guiding, improving, and inspecting the health work of schools at all levels in the local area. Each school should set up a health committee or appropriate personnel to be responsible for actively improving school hygiene and medical work, carry out health education in a planned manner, and develop good hygiene habits. All colleges and universities and secondary schools with female students should set up female counselors or designate appropriate female teachers to be responsible for guiding the health work of female students. Primary schools and kindergartens should especially establish close contact with parents to improve their attention to the health of their children. When schools recruit new students, they must pay attention to physical examinations. Those who suffer from serious infectious diseases should be restricted from entering school. Currently, schools in major cities should try to hold key physical examinations for students every spring and summer; if serious chronic infectious disease patients are found, they should be advised to suspend school for recuperation, and even minor patients should pay attention to prevent infection. Schools at all levels should guide students to correct shortcomings and hold regular vaccinations and injections.

	IV. Pay attention to sports and entertainment activities:
	Schools at all levels should effectively improve physical education teaching, enrich sports and entertainment equipment as much as possible, and strengthen students' physical exercise. In addition to morning exercises and recess activities, students should be organized to participate extensively in sports and entertainment activities; however, the activity methods should be diverse to suit the different ages, genders, and physical conditions of students, and prevent the tendency of "championshipism" and excessive exercise that harms health. Secondary schools and above should appropriately use holidays to organize collective field activities. Localities can hold sports meets according to local conditions, and promote individual or group health competitions to promote attention to students' sports problems in all aspects.

	V. Improve student food management methods:
	The administrative aspects of schools at all levels should be effectively responsible for student food management work, and should not completely delegate it to students themselves; attention should be paid to the education of management personnel, preventing the phenomenon of corruption and waste and correcting habits of not paying attention to hygiene; practical and feasible methods should be studied to improve students' food and drinking water according to the necessary conditions for nutrition and the local food situation; and establish contact with student families to help parents pay attention to their children's nutrition.

	VI. The allocation of school funds should appropriately take care of the needs of health work:
	The assessment of people's scholarships in schools at all levels should mainly take care of students with economic difficulties. The allocated funds for people's scholarships are absolutely not allowed to be used for other purposes. In the allocation of teaching and administrative expenses in schools at all levels, attention should be paid to supplementing school sports, entertainment, hygiene, and medical equipment; and organize school teachers, students, and staff to improve the school's sanitary environment by themselves.

The education administrative departments of people's governments at all levels should abide by the above-mentioned regulations, urge and guide schools at all levels under their jurisdiction to formulate plans and implementation measures to improve the health of students according to the conditions of cities or villages and the different conditions of schools, strictly implement them, and conduct regular inspections; school health work should be used as one of the main items for school performance evaluation, and timely commendations, rewards or criticisms should be given according to the merits of the results. At the end of each semester, schools at all levels and education administrative departments of people's governments at all levels should make a special report on the health of students and the handling process to the higher authorities.

　　中央人民政府政务院关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定
    中央人民政府政务院于六日命令公布一九五一年七月十三日政务院第九十三次政务会议通过的“关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定”，全文如下：
    目前全国各级学校的学生健康不良的状况，颇为严重。许多学校由于功课过重，社团活动过多，加以伙食管理不尽得法，卫生工作注意不够，致影响了学生的身体健康。这种情况必须加以改变。应该指出：增进学生身体健康，乃是保证学生完成学习任务，并培养出有强健体魄的现代青年的重大任务之一。各级人民政府教育行政部门及各级学校教职员必须严肃注意这一问题，立即纠正忽视学生健康的思想和对学生健康不负责任的态度，切实改善各级学校的学生健康状况。为此特作如下决定：
            一、调整学生日常学习及生活的时间：
    １、学生每日上课、自习（包括高等学校及中等学校的实验）时间：高等学校及高级中等学校不得超过九小时；初级中等学校不得超过八小时；小学高年级不得超过六小时（均包括课间休息时间在内）。
    ２、学生每日睡眠时间：规定高等学校八小时；中等学校九小时；小学十小时。夏季酌量增加午睡时间。
    ３、学生每日体育、娱乐活动或生产劳动时间：除体育课及晨操或课间活动外，以一小时至一小时半为原则。通学生可酌量减少。学生从事生产劳动时，应避免过重的体力劳动。
            二、减轻学生课业学习与社团活动的负担：
    １、各级学校应遵照中央人民政府教育部的规定，删除重复的、不需要的课程与教材内容，改进教学方法。教师授课应以课堂教学为主，要讲得明白，使学生了解透彻；要多在课堂内演习题，不要给学生过多的课外习题及不必要的困难习题；考试时也不要故意出深僻的试题；要统一合理地分配实验、自习等课外作业的时间。各科教师应在分配时间内将课程教完、教好，并纠正和防止发动任何的突击、竞赛、硬赶进度等偏向。
    ２、学生以学习为自己主要的任务。因此，各级学校应合理地辅导学生的社团活动，切实地减少会议的次数与时间，并适当地分配各种社团活动的时间。学生参加群众游行时，应注意他们的体力。中央人民政府教育部应会同中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会及全国学生联合会，定出切实有效的具体办法，减少学生校内校外的社团活动，并限制学生参加社团会议的时间，在高等学校及高级中等学校每人每周不超过三小时；在初级中等学校每人每周不超过二小时；在小学每人每周不超过一小时半。社团负责人的开会时间不得超过上述规定的一倍。各级学校行政方面及青年团、学生会等有关方面，应遵照这些规定和办法，按月排定各种会议及社团活动的日程，由校长召开会议通过，作为一种制度，严格执行，并应由学校行政方面、青年团、学生会会同定期检查。学生社团的会议应有充分准备，有些会议可以联合召开。各级学校必须坚决克服学校社团活动的多头领导和组织重叠的偏向。担任学生社团工作的学生以一人一职为原则，不得已必须兼职者亦只能以担任两种职务为限。
            三、改进学校卫生工作：
    各省、市、县人民政府教育行政部门应会同同级卫生行政部门、教育工会、青年团、学生联合会及当地医疗机关的代表，组织学校保健指导委员会，负责指导、改进及检查当地各级学校的保健工作。各级学校内设保健委员会或适当人员，负责积极改善学校卫生及医疗工作，有计划地进行卫生教育，养成良好的卫生习惯。凡有女生的高等学校及中等学校，应设女教导员或指定适当的女教师负责指导女生的保健工作。小学和幼稚园尤应与家长取得密切联系，提高他们对子女健康的注意。学校招考新生时，必须注意体格检查。凡患有重传染病者，应限制其入学。目前在各大城市的学校应尽可能设法于每年春夏间举行学生体格的重点检查；发现有严重的慢性传染病患者，应劝令其休学疗养，轻微患者亦应注意防止传染。各级学校应指导学生进行缺点矫治，定期举行预防接种及注射。
            四、注重体育、娱乐活动：
    各级学校应切实改进体育教学，尽可能地充实体育娱乐的设备，加强学生体格的锻炼。除晨操及课间活动外，应组织学生普遍参加体育运动及娱乐活动；但活动方法应多种多样，以适应学生不同的年龄、性别、和身体状况，并防止“锦标主义”及运动过度损害健康的偏向。中等以上学校应适当地利用假期组织集体的野外活动。各地可根据当地情况举行运动会，提倡个人或团体的健康比赛，以促进各方面对学生体育问题的重视。
            五、改善学生伙食管理办法：
    各级学校行政方面对学生伙食管理工作应切实负责，不得完全推给学生自己管理；应注意对管理人员的教育，防止贪污、浪费的现象及改正不注意卫生的习惯；应根据营养必需的条件和当地食物状况，研究切实可行的办法来改善学生的伙食和饮水；并与学生家庭建立联系，协助家长注意子女的营养。
            六、学校经费的支配，应适当地照顾保健工作的需要：
    各级学校人民助学金的评定，主要应照顾经济困难的学生。额定的人民助学金的经费，绝对不准挪作别用。各级学校教学行政费的分配，应注意补充学校体育、娱乐、卫生、医药设备；并组织学校师生员工自己动手，改善学校卫生环境。
    各级人民政府教育行政部门，应遵照上述各项规定，督促指导所属各级学校，根据城市或乡村的条件及学校的不同情况，订出改善学生健康状况的计划及实施办法，严格执行，并定期进行检查；应将学校保健工作，作为对学校考绩的主要项目之一，并按成绩优劣，及时予以表扬、奖励或指责。各级学校、各级人民政府教育行政部门，于学期终了时，应将学生健康状况及处理经过向上级作专题报告。
