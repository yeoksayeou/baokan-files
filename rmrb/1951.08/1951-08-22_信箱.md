    Question: Is it worth promoting the method of labor and management signing "Production Increase Donation Contracts" or "Patriotic Production Increase Donation Pledges" in the donation movement? Will it create coercion of one party by the other and blur the labor-management relationship?
    Answer: During the donation movement, workers (shop assistants) in many enterprises and units in many places have signed "Labor-Management Production Increase Donation Contracts" or "Labor-Management Patriotic Production Increase Donation Pledges" with the capitalists. This practice is worth promoting. Local experiences have proven that in order to promote the development of the donation movement in the industrial and commercial circles and integrate their donation movement with the movement to increase production, improve management, and increase income, it is necessary to adopt the method of labor-management consultation, and the results of the consultation should be fixed in the form of "Labor-Management Production Increase Donation Contracts" or "Labor-Management Patriotic Production Increase Donation Pledges." Some industrialists and businessmen do not consult with workers (shop assistants) when formulating production increase donation plans, or unilaterally formulate excessively high plans for increasing production and increasing income, which has proven to be unworkable. However, when formulating donation methods, both labor and management should adopt a democratic and equal approach to consult with each other. At the same time, it is best for both parties to separately stipulate a portion of their respective increased production income for donation (in addition to donating increased production income, industrialists and businessmen can also voluntarily donate a portion of normal profits, and workers can also voluntarily donate their wages for one Sunday overtime each month or a portion thereof). The above-mentioned production increase donation plan or pledge can become part of the patriotic pledge separately formulated by labor and management, but it cannot replace the patriotic pledge (because the patriotic pledge has other content, and labor and management should generally formulate it separately), nor is it equivalent to a general labor contract. As long as this is the case, the signing of these contracts or pledges will not cause coercion of one party by the other or be detrimental to any party, nor will it blur the labor-management relationship, and will become a driving force for promoting the development of the patriotic donation movement of both parties.

    问：在捐献运动中劳资双方签订“增产捐献合同”或“爱国增产捐献公约”的办法是否值得提倡，是否会造成一方对另方的强迫和模糊劳资关系？
    答：在捐献运动期间，许多地方许多企业单位的工人（店员）已与资方订立“劳资增产捐献合同”或“劳资双方爱国增产捐献公约”，这种做法是值得提倡的。各地经验证明，要推动工商界捐献运动的发展，并使他们的捐献运动与增加生产、改善经营、增加收入的运动结合起来，就必须采取劳资协商的办法，并且应该用“劳资增产捐献合同”或“劳资双方爱国增产捐献公约”之类的形式把协商的结果固定起来。有的工商业家订立增产捐献计划时，不与工人（店员）协商，或者片面地订出过高的增加生产和增加收入的计划，事实证明是行不通的。但在规定捐献办法时，劳资双方都应该采取民主的、平等的方式来与对方协商，同时双方最好分开规定各自捐献增产所得的一部分（除捐献增产所得外，工商业家尚可自愿捐献正常盈利的一部分，工人尚可自愿捐献每月一次星期日加班的工资或其一部分）。上述增产捐献计划或公约，可以成为劳资双方各自订立的爱国公约的一部分，但不能代替爱国公约（因为爱国公约还有其他内容，劳资双方一般也应分开订立），也不等于一般的劳资合同。只要如此，这些合同或公约的订立，就不会造成一方对另一方的强迫或对任何一方面不利，也不会模糊劳资关系，而且将会成为推动双方爱国捐献运动发展的动力。
