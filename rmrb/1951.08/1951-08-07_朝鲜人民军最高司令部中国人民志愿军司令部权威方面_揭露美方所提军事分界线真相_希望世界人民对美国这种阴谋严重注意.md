　　[Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th] What exactly is the specific content of the military demarcation line proposal put forward by the US side at the Korean armistice talks? This is a question of concern to the whole world. Recently, the US side has repeatedly claimed that their military demarcation line proposal is based on the existing battle line, and the press office of Ridgway's headquarters issued a so-called "refutation" today, claiming that the statement that the US side demanded the establishment of a demarcation line north of the existing battle line was a "rumor." However, the Tokyo "Allied" headquarters openly stated twice on July 31st and August 4th that the military demarcation line proposed by the US was between their so-called air and sea front, the Yalu River, the Tumen River, and the existing land battle line. Therefore, the truth has become a question. As for the proposal of the Sino-Korean delegation to take the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, it is known to the world. In order for the people of the world to objectively judge the merits of the proposals of both sides on the military demarcation line, the reporter specially interviewed the authoritative sources of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the truth about the military demarcation line proposal of the US side. According to reports: The military demarcation line proposal put forward by the US side is in line with the plan revealed twice by the Tokyo "Allied Headquarters." The so-called statement that the US military demarcation line proposal is based on the existing battle line is completely inconsistent with the facts. The US military demarcation line proposal was put forward as part of its demilitarized zone plan. The location of its military demarcation line is within our front lines, far ahead of the existing battle line north of the 38th parallel, that is, from Xio-ri (10 kilometers northwest of Kosong) on the east coast, southwest to Changdo-ri (10 kilometers north of Kumhwa), then west to Dosudae (10 kilometers north of Pyonggang), then southwest to Jotan-ri (4 kilometers northwest of Kimchon), to Daechon-ri (33 kilometers west of Kimchon), southwest to Gyoengdong (17 kilometers southeast of Haeju), and then south to the line of the west coast. The southern and northern edges of the demilitarized zone they proposed are two lines extending 10 miles south and north from this line as the center line. Based on the military demarcation line of this plan, the current US positions are pushed forward 18 to 31 kilometers north of the Imjin River, and in the area west of the Imjin River, the depth of its advance is as much as 50 kilometers. The total area of its advanced area east and west of the Imjin River is more than 7,400 square kilometers. According to the principle of fairness and rationality, the area south of this military demarcation line should be delineated from the US positions, and the US deliberately confuses the southern edge of this demilitarized zone with the military demarcation line in an attempt to confuse the public, but this cannot deceive people. Even with the southern edge of this demilitarized zone as the standard, east of the Imjin River, they also pushed their current positions forward by 5 to 15 kilometers; while west of the Imjin River, they simply have no existing positions, but they also delineated a large area as their positions after the truce. In this way, based on the southern edge of this demilitarized zone, they have also advanced by more than 3,200 square kilometers. According to the US proposal, the US front line after the truce (that is, the southern edge of the demilitarized zone) should advance more than 3,200 square kilometers from the existing battle line; and according to the same plan, our front line after the truce (that is, the northern edge of the demilitarized zone) must retreat 38 to 53 kilometers from the existing positions east of the Imjin River, and about 68 kilometers west of the Imjin River, a total retreat of more than 12,000 square kilometers.
　　After learning about the US military demarcation line proposal, the reporter believes that it is absolutely necessary to publicize the truth of this absurd and arrogant proposal to all fair people in the world. Everyone knows that the reason why the Korean War has a basis for stopping is because the military forces of the belligerent parties are actually in a state of balance at the present stage, and the people of the world are so eager to stop the Korean War first on a fair and reasonable basis, so there is a general call to stop the Korean War at the 38th parallel, so there is Malik's just proposal to call on both sides to withdraw from the 38th parallel to stop the Korean War, so there is the premise for the Kaesong talks to be held this time. However, the US side, under the pretext of its unfounded air and sea superiority, put forward such an absurd and arrogant proposal, which makes people wonder whether the US side is sincere in agreeing to hold armistice talks, or whether it is only using this to deceive world public opinion, deceive the people and soldiers of the United States and other countries participating in the war of aggression against Korea, and deceive those governments that were originally coerced into participating in the aggression and now desire to end the war, and in fact intend to make the talks fail, so as to continue its unjust and adventurous war of interference in Korea, which is opposed by the people of the world. All peace-loving people in the world should pay serious attention to this conspiracy of the US authorities.

　　朝鲜人民军最高司令部中国人民志愿军司令部权威方面
    揭露美方所提军事分界线真相
    希望世界人民对美国这种阴谋严重注意
    【新华社平壤六日电】美国方面在朝鲜停战谈判会议上所提出的军事分界线方案的具体内容到底是怎么回事？这是全世界关心的问题。美方日来忽然一再宣称他们的军事分界线方案就是以现有战线为标准的方案，李奇微总部新闻处并于今日发表了所谓“辟谣”的声明，宣称关于美方要求在现有战线以北建立分界线的说法是“谣传”。但东京“盟军”总部却在七月三十一日、八月四日两次公开表示美方提议的军事分界线是在他们所谓海空前线鸭绿江、图们江与现有陆地战线之间。因此真相究竟如何，就成为疑问了。至于中朝代表团所提出的以三八线为军事分界线的方案是举世皆知的。为使世界人民得以客观地评判双方关于军事分界线提案的是非起见，记者特就美方所提军事分界线方案的真相访问朝鲜人民军最高司令部暨中国人民志愿军司令部权威方面。据告：美方所提军事分界线方案是符合于东京“盟军总部”所两次透露的方案的。所谓美方军事分界线提案乃是以现有战线为标准的说法，却是完全不合事实的。美方军事分界线的方案是作为他的非军事区方案的一个组成部分提出来的。其军事分界线位置在三八线北现有战线很远前方的我方阵地之内，即从东海岸西峨里（高城北偏西十公里）起，向西南至昌道里（金城北十公里），再向西至道修岱（平康北十公里），再向西南至猪滩里（金川西北四公里），至大庆里（金川西三十三公里），向西南至桥项洞（海州东南十七公里），再向南直至西海岸一线。其所提非军事地区的南缘和北缘，则为以此线为中线向南向北各伸出十英里的两线。以此方案的军事分界线为准，美方目前阵地在临津江以东向北推进十八至三十一公里之远，在临津江以西地区其推进之深度竟至五十公里。其在临津江东西推进地区之总面积为七千四百余平方公里。而根据公平合理的原则，这个军事分界线以南的地区是应该由美方阵地中划出的，美方故意将这个非军事区的南缘与军事分界线混为一谈，以图混淆视听，但这是骗不了人的。即以这个非军事区的南缘而论，在临津江以东他们也把他们的目前阵地向北推进五至十五公里；而在临津江以西他们根本就没有什么现有阵地，但也划出了大块面积作为他们休战后的阵地。这样，以这个非军事区的南缘为准，他们也向前推进了三千二百余平方公里。根据美方提案，休战后的美方前线（即非军事区的南缘），应该从现有战线向前推进三千二百余平方公里；而根据同一方案，休战后的我方前线（即非军事区的北缘），在临津江以东则须从现有阵地后撤三十八至五十三公里，在临津江以西后撤约六十八公里，共退出约一万二千余平方公里。
    记者于获悉美方军事分界线方案以后，认为完全有必要把这个荒谬狂妄的提案的真相公之于全世界一切公正的人士之前。谁都知道朝鲜战争之所以有停止下来的基础，就是因为实际上交战双方的军事力量在现阶段中是处于平衡状态之下，而全世界人民又如此迫切地要求在公平合理的基础上，首先停止朝鲜战争，因此才有在三八线上停止朝鲜战争的普遍呼声，因此才有马立克号召双方撤离三八线以停止朝鲜战争的公正提议，因此才有这次开城谈判得以举行的前提。但美方竟以其莫须有的海空军优势为借口提出如此荒谬狂妄的方案，这就使人不能不怀疑美方同意举行停战谈判是否具有诚意，抑系仅为借此蒙蔽世界舆论，欺骗美国及其他参加侵略朝鲜战争国家的人民、士兵，并且欺骗那些原被胁迫参加侵略现在渴望结束战争的国家的政府，而实际上则有意使谈判失败，以便继续进行其为全世界人民所反对的干涉朝鲜的不义的冒险战争。全世界一切爱好和平的人民对于美国当局的这种阴谋，应当严重注意。
