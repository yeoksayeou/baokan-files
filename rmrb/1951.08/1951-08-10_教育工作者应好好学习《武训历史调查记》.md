　　Educators Should Diligently Study "The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun"
    Editor:
    After reading "The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," I further realized that all schools cannot be separated from politics; all reactionary ruling class schools have always served the interests of their own class.

    The three schools established by Wu Xun are examples of reactionary feudal ruling class schools.

    "The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" clearly tells us: "The nature of the three schools run by Wu Xun was the same; they were all schools for landlords and merchants." For example, the "Chongxian Free School" in Liulin Town, Tangyi County, "did not have a primary class at all in the first seven years (1888-1894), only a classics class. And the students in the classics class were mostly from 'good families' (landlords), and the rest were also rich peasants or merchants, without a single middle peasant, let alone poor or hired peasants." Although this "free school" established a primary class for a time between 1895 and 1898, "even among the primary class students, there were very few children of poor farmers." According to Han Zhuling, a middle peasant who studied in the primary class in 1895 but dropped out after being beaten for not being able to afford holiday gifts, of the fifteen students he could remember in that class, "only one was a poor peasant, three were middle peasants, and one was an outsider selling baked cakes, considered working people; the rest were merchants and relatively wealthy families in Liulin Town."

    If the student composition of "Chongxian Free School" was as described above, then what about its teaching content and teacher qualifications? In the classics class, "they studied books such as the Book of Poetry, the Book of Documents, the Book of Changes, the Book of Rites, the Spring and Autumn Annals, and the Zuo Zhuan." "The qualifications of teachers were also very high; they had to be Jinshi (successful candidates in the highest imperial examinations), Juren (recommended men), or Bagong (tribute students)."

    From this, it can be seen that reactionary ruling class schools are established for the children of their own class. Wu Xun's schools were like this, and all other schools run by the exploiting classes are no different. Some people say that "schools have no class nature" and that "schools established by the exploiting classes also have 'benefits' for the working people," which is not worth refuting.

    Wu Xun and the Wu Xun propagandists shouted "for the poor children" with every breath, which is exactly the same as the "national" nature of schools promoted by all reactionary ruling classes! When the ruling class controls the main means of production and the poor people have no clothes or food, the so-called "for the poor," "national," and "education has no class nature" are nothing but deceptive words! Facts have proved that Wu Xun's three schools were all controlled by reactionary politics and did not escape the influence of politics in the slightest. Those who blindly and isolatedly regard education as noble should diligently study "The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" and further criticize our educational thinking as a result.

### 教育工作者应好好学习《武训历史调查记》

　　教育工作者应好好学习《武训历史调查记》
    编辑同志：
    读过了《武训历史调查记》，我进一步地认识到：一切学校都不能离开政治；一切反动的统治阶级的学校从来都是为其本阶级的利益而服务的。
    武训所兴办的三所学校，就是反动封建统治阶级学校的例子。
    《武训历史调查记》明白地告诉我们：武训所办的“三所学校的性质是一样的，都是为地主和商人办的学校。”例如，堂邑县柳林镇的“崇贤义塾”，“在头七年（一八八八年—一八九四年），根本没有蒙班，只有经班。而经班的学生，大多数都是‘好户’（地主），其余也是富农或商人，没有一个中农，更不要说贫雇农了。”这所“义塾”，虽然在一八九五年—一八九八年一度设立了蒙班，但“就是蒙班学生中贫苦农民的子弟也很少。”据一八九五年曾在蒙班读过书，后因送不起节礼挨打而退学的中农韩祝龄说，他所能记起的那一班十五个学生中，“只有一个贫农，三个中农和一个卖火烧的外来户，算是劳动人民；其余都是柳林镇上的商人和比较有钱的人家。”
    “崇贤义塾”的学生成份既如上述，那么，其教学内容及教师身份又是怎样呢？在经班中，“读的是诗、书、易、礼、春秋、左传等书”。“教师的资格也很高，须要进士、举人或拔贡才行”。
    由此可知，反动的统治阶级的学校是为其本阶级的子女而设立的。武训的学校如此，其他一切剥削阶级所办的学校亦无不如此。有的人说，“学校是没有阶级性的”，“剥削阶级设立的学校对劳动人民也有‘好处’”，这是不值得一驳的。
    武训及武训宣传者口口声声所嚷的“为了穷苦孩子”，与一切反动统治阶级所宣传的学校的“全民”性质如出一辄！当统治阶级掌握主要的生产资料，穷苦人民无衣无食的时候，所谓“为贫寒”“全民”“教育没有阶级性”等说法，都不过是骗人的词句而已！事实证明：武训三所学校都受着反动政治所支配，丝毫也没有逃出政治的影响。那些盲目地孤立地以教育为清高的人，应好好学习《武训历史调查记》，并由此进一步批判我们的教育思想才对。
