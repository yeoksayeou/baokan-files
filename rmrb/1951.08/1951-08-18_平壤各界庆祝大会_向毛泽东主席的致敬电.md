Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 17th: Pyongyang City's celebratory meeting for the 6th anniversary of the liberation of Korea, "August 15th," sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao Zedong. The text of the telegram is as follows:

Great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, who sincerely aids the Korean people:

Today, as the Korean people are waging a great Fatherland Liberation War to defend the freedom and independence of their fatherland, we celebrate the 6th anniversary of the Soviet army's liberation of Korea, the national holiday of "August 15th." We extend our warm gratitude and congratulations to you, our respected leader.

The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of the sons and daughters of the great Chinese people, share common ideals and aspirations with our People's Army for peace, freedom, and national prosperity. In the just war against the common enemy, the American imperialist aggressors, they have displayed unparalleled tenacity and heroism, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, gloriously defending our country's independence and freedom, and making enormous contributions to the cause of safeguarding peace and security in Asia and the world.

The Korean people will never forget the enormous support given to us by you and the Chinese people under your leadership. The Korean people will never forget the great achievements of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers in their heroic struggle on our country's soil. We will pass on our affection and respect for you and the Chinese people to our descendants.

To celebrate the 6th anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation of Korea, we, the Korean people, are determined to further strengthen the friendship forged in blood between the peoples of Korea and China, persist in resisting the aggression of the common enemy, American imperialism, on our country's soil, and fight to defend the freedom and independence of both countries and to safeguard peace in the Far East.

We believe that the American imperialists' aggressive plans are bound to fail, because we are fighting for justice and have the enthusiastic support of all peace-loving people and the international democratic camp, led by the great Soviet people.

For the more brilliant victory of the great Chinese people, for the eternal friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China, and for peace in the Far East, we respectfully wish you boundless longevity.
