Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 2nd: A commentary by our agency's reporter on the Kaesong Conference in the past week:

　　The Korean armistice negotiations have entered the discussion of substantive issues for the seventh day. Due to the US side's unreasonable refusal to establish the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line for both sides to establish a demilitarized zone, the seven-day meeting has made no progress. Recalling the universally welcomed radio speech by the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, on June 23, he pointed out that the withdrawal of troops from the 38th parallel by both belligerent parties to achieve an armistice and ceasefire was the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. He believed that taking this step was possible "as long as there is a sincere desire to end the bloodshed in Korea." Indeed, whether the United States has a sincere desire in the armistice negotiations is now facing a strict test. It is universally known that the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have fully demonstrated their sincere goodwill towards the armistice negotiations during the discussion of the agenda. Our side's insistence on establishing the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line for both sides to establish a demilitarized zone is a further expression of our side's sincere desire to end the Korean War and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. This demand is also the common demand of the vast majority of humanity around the world. Obviously, the proposal to establish the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line for both sides to establish a demilitarized zone is the basis for both sides agreeing to hold armistice negotiations this time. This most fundamental condition is fair and reasonable to both sides, and undoubtedly feasible as long as both sides have the sincerity to cease hostilities. To understand this, we might as well review and analyze the Korean war situation. People know that the war has been going on for thirteen months. In the first six months of the war, one of the belligerent parties once pushed the front line to the Nakdong River at the southern end of the peninsula, and later the other side also advanced north to the Yalu River. However, since January of this year, the war has been taking place in the area north and south of the 38th parallel. In the seven months of operations this year, the Korean and Chinese People's forces have twice entered and exited the 38th parallel, and only after the Korean and Chinese People's armies completed their combat missions and took the initiative to withdraw north did the US and Rhee forces cross the 38th parallel twice. In these seven months, our army was south of the 38th parallel for five months, and the US and Rhee forces were north of the 38th parallel for two months. At present, the belligerent parties each occupy some areas north and south of the 38th parallel. The Korean and Chinese People's armies control an area south of the 38th parallel, from Ongjin Peninsula in the west, passing through Kaesong in the east to Neumuri, north of Jangdan, about 130 kilometers. The US and Rhee forces temporarily occupy an area north of the 38th parallel, from Gorampo-ri in the west to Maryeon-ri, north of Ganseong on the east coast, about 140 kilometers. The length of the areas occupied by both sides is almost equal. Therefore, the 38th parallel precisely reflects the current military situation, and also reflects the relative balance of military forces between the two sides. Then, isn't it extremely fair for both sides to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, withdraw from the 38th parallel, and establish a demilitarized zone north and south of the 38th parallel? Since the war started at the 38th parallel, isn't it extremely reasonable to restore the 38th parallel now that the war is over? The US and British press have reported the opinions of some warmongers in the United States, saying that the 38th parallel is a geographical line of latitude, not a military line. It is true that the 38th parallel is a geographical line of latitude, but it is also the most appropriate military demarcation line. This is the armistice line determined by the current military situation and the current contrast in military strength between the two sides. Despite having superior naval and air forces, the US military is currently unable and unwilling to push the front line further north. The Korean and Chinese People's armies have not considered pushing the military demarcation line back to the Nakdong River at all during the armistice talks. Because what the Korean and Chinese People's armies are concerned about is how to end the Korean War as soon as possible and satisfy the peace aspirations of the people and the US and Rhee soldiers. The Korean and Chinese People's armies insist on the proposal to establish the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line and establish a demilitarized zone to achieve a ceasefire and truce. The US and British press also reported the US opinion, saying that the 38th parallel has no military significance and is not conducive to the US defense. If that's the case, then comparatively, this disadvantage is even more serious for the peace-loving Korean people. The fact is obvious that the peace-loving Korean people will never attack others first, and will only be forced to fight back when others attack. Since the United States accepted Malik's proposal and is willing to hold peace talks, but resolutely refuses to use the 38th parallel as the ceasefire demarcation line on the grounds of a non-military line, then people will inevitably suspect whether the US representative is negotiating for peace in Korea, or just taking a breather to fight again? This question must be answered by the US representative in the meeting with their concrete actions.

　　There is a sign that deserves the vigilance and attention of people all over the world. People know that Kaesong was designated as a temporary neutral zone during the peace talks at the suggestion of the US representative. However, from July 10, when the Kaesong armistice negotiations were held, to the 29th, 14 incidents of intrusions have continuously occurred in the periphery of the Kaesong neutral zone, along the line thirty li southeast, due south and southwest of Kaesong by the US and Rhee forces. US air force groups also frequently flew over Kaesong and reconnaissance bombed and strafed peaceful villages around the neutral zone. From July 25th, US and Rhee naval vessels at the entrance of the Han River on the west coast bombarded peaceful villages in the areas of Bonghwari, Dangdupo-ri, and Baima Mountain day and night, with the sound of artillery fire constantly audible in Kaesong. The US aggressor army is vainly attempting to exert "pressure" on the Kaesong armistice negotiations with their boasted naval and air force superiority. The US military's naval and air force "power" has never been able to scare the Korean and Chinese people. Their stupid and clumsy practice reveals their attitude towards the current armistice negotiations.

　　美方无理拒绝以三八线为军事分界线，值得全世界人民注视和警惕。
    ——新华社记者评述开城会议一周来毫无进展
    【新华社开城二日电】本社记者对最近一周开城会议的述评：
    朝鲜停战谈判会议进入议程实质问题的讨论，已经第七天了。由于美方代表无理拒绝确定三八线为双方军事分界线以建立非军事区，以致七天的会议毫无进展。回忆苏联驻联合国代表马立克在六月二十三日的受到全世界欢迎的广播演说中，曾指明交战双方把军队撤离三八线以实现停战与休战，是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一个步骤。他认为采取这种步骤是可能的，“只要有结束朝鲜境内的流血冲突的真诚愿望”。确是如此，美国在停战谈判中究竟是否具有真诚愿望，现在就遇到了严格的考验了。举世周知，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团已经在讨论会议议程的阶段中，充分地表示了自己对停战谈判的真诚善意。我方代表坚持确立三八线为双方军事分界线以建立非军事区的要求，又是我方对结束朝鲜战争和平解决朝鲜问题的真诚愿望的进一步表示。这种要求，同时也是全世界绝大多数人类的共同要求。很明显的，确立三八线为双方军事分界线以建立非军事区这个主张，是这次双方同意举行停战谈判的基础。这种最根本的条件，对双方是公平合理的，只要双方具有停战的诚意，无疑地也是切实可行的。为了明了这一点，我们不妨回顾和分析一下朝鲜战局。人们都知道战争已经进行了十三个月，在战争头六个月中，交战的一方曾将战线推进到半岛南端的洛东江，后来另一方面也向北推进到鸭绿江。但是从今年的一月起，战争便在三八线南北地区进行。朝、中人民部队在今年七个月的作战中，曾两度进出于三八线，而在朝、中人民军队完成作战任务主动向北撤离以后，美、李军才得以两度越过三八线。在这七个月中，我军有五个月在三八线南，美李军有两个月在三八线北。目前交战双方在三八线南北各占有若干地方。朝、中人民军队控制了三八线以南西起瓮津半岛，东经开城以迄长湍以北讷木里的地区，约一百三十余公里。美、李军则暂时占领了三八线以北西起高浪浦里以迄东海岸杆城以北马连里的地区，约一百四十余公里。双方所占的地区长度几乎相等。因此三八线正是反映了目前军事情势的一条线，也是反映了目前双方军事力量的相对的平衡的一条线。那末双方以三八线为军事分界线，从三八线撤离，依三八线向南北划建一非军事区，不是极其公平的吗？战争既起于三八线，现在战争结束仍然恢复三八线，这不是极其合理的吗？美、英的新闻界曾报道美国某些好战分子的意见，说三八线是一条纬度的地理线，不是一条军事线。不错，三八线是一条纬度的地理线，但它也是一条最适当的军事分界线，这是目前的军事情势和目前双方军事力量对比所决定的停战线。美军尽管拥有优势海、空军，目前却已经不能也不敢把战线再推向北面。朝、中人民军队在停战会议中，则根本没有考虑把军事分界线再推到洛东江。因为朝、中人民军队所关心的是如何早日结束朝鲜战争，满足和平人民和美、李军士兵对和平的愿望。朝、中人民军队坚持主张以三八线为双方军事分界线建立非军事区，实现停火休战。美、英新闻界又报道美国的意见，说三八线是毫无军事意义的，不利于美方防守的。如果这么说，那么比较起来，这种不利对爱好和平的朝鲜人民是更严重些的。事实很明显，爱好和平的朝鲜人民决不会首先去进攻别人，只在别人打来的时候才被迫起来回击。美国既然接受马立克的建议，愿意举行和平谈判，但却又以非军事线的理由，坚决拒绝以三八线为休战分界线，那末人们就势必怀疑美国代表是为了朝鲜和平来谈判的呢，还是为了喘口气歇歇再打呢？这个问题，是要由美国代表在会议中用自己的具体行动来回答的。
    有一种征候值得全世界人民警惕和注视。人们知道，开城在和谈期间，在美方代表的提议下，被划为暂时的中立区。但是从七月十日开城停战谈判举行以来，到二十九日止，在开城中立区的外围，美李军向开城东南、正南、西南三十华里一线，已连续发生十四次窜扰事件。美国的空军机群也不时从开城上空掠过，并在中立区周围和平村庄上空侦察炸射。从七月二十五日起，在西海岸汉江入口处的美、李海军舰艇，日夜向我烽火里、堂头浦里，白马山一带和平村庄轰击，炮声日夜不断，在开城清晰可闻。美国侵略军正妄想用他们所吹嘘的海、空军优势，对开城停战谈判施以“压力”。美军的海、空军“威力”从来也不可能吓倒朝、中人民，他们这种愚蠢而拙劣的做法，正揭示了他们对目前停战谈判所抱的态度。
