Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th. The New York "Daily Worker" in an editorial on August 1st, once again refuted the demands made by the Americans at the Kaesong talks regarding the military demarcation line, believing that "they have already kicked aside Malik's original proposal which allowed the negotiations to begin." The editorial pointed out: on the one hand, new demands of a military-aggressive nature are being made in the ceasefire negotiations, and highly provocative military actions are being taken against Korea, "at the same time, at home, political warnings are widely circulating that a ceasefire would be a 'terrible failure' for the Pentagon."

The editorial also stated: "Speculators fear that peace will cause prices to fall. Anti-communist experts fear that peace will make it more difficult for them to stifle the rights of freedom stipulated in the Constitution. Generals fear that peace will reduce their massive 'defense' spending, which amounts to billions. But the United States can use peace to prevent our soldiers from being killed, lower prices, and restore our dwindling democratic freedoms." The editorial called on "the American people to take swift action to stop sabotaging the Korean ceasefire negotiations and demand peace!"

    斥美政府提出侵略性要求
    【新华社布拉格九日电】纽约《工人日报》在八月一日的社论中，再一次驳斥美国人在开城谈判中提出的关于军事分界线的要求，认为“他们已经一脚踢开使谈判得以开始的马立克原先的建议。”社论指出：一方面，在停火谈判中提出具有军事侵略性质的新要求，并对朝鲜采取极富挑衅性的军事行动，“同时，在国内，关于停火将是五角大楼‘可怕的失败’的政治警告”正在广泛地流传着。
    社论又称：“投机家害怕和平会使物价下降。反共专家害怕和平会使他们更难扼杀宪法中规定的自由权利。将军们害怕和平会使他们的数目庞大的以数十亿计的‘防务’费用减少。但是，美国可以用和平来使我们的士兵不再被打死，使物价下降，并且恢复我们的日趋凋零的民主自由。”社论号召“美国人民迅速行动起来，阻止破坏朝鲜停火谈判，并且要求和平吧！”
