　　Kaifeng City Wenxing Furniture Store Manager
    Should Not Prevent Apprentices from Joining the Trade Union
    To the Editor:
    There are three apprentices in the Wenxing Furniture Store at No. 14, North Three Sage Temple Gate, Kaifeng City. The store manager, Li Wende, often beats and scolds them and prevents them from joining the trade union.
    Apprentices' lives should be properly addressed, but the apprentices at Wenxing Store, some of whom have worked for two years, even have to pay for their own haircuts. An apprentice named Zhao asked the manager for money for a haircut and was dismissed without cause. The apprentice, Zhao, disagreed and brought the matter to the trade union. Li Wende came up with another plan. He said to Zhao: "It's wheat season now, go home and help with the wheat harvest, and I'll call you back after the wheat season." Li Wende tricked the apprentice away in this way, without giving him a penny. Now that the wheat season is over, Li Wende sent Zhao a letter telling him not to come back.
    I believe that the actions of Li Wende, the manager of Wenxing Furniture Store, in preventing apprentices from joining the trade union and arbitrarily deceiving apprentices are unacceptable. I hope that the relevant local authorities will investigate and deal with this matter.

Editor's note:
    Recently, we have received a series of letters exposing and accusing the owners of certain shops and workshops of mistreating apprentices. The letters point out that the owners of these shops and workshops are taking various measures to infringe on the legitimate rights of apprentices: they arbitrarily extend the working hours of apprentices, some reaching more than eighteen hours per day; the lives of apprentices are extremely poor, and they do not make the necessary improvements; they restrict workers from joining trade unions; and even, with extremely barbaric attitudes, beat and scold apprentices. This kind of feudal oppression of apprentices is absolutely not allowed to exist in a new democratic society, and illegal shop and workshop owners should be punished by law.

### 开封市文兴家具铺经理  不应阻止学徒加入工会

　　开封市文兴家具铺经理
    不应阻止学徒加入工会
    编辑同志：
    开封市北三圣庙门十四号文兴家具铺有三个学徒，该号经理李文德常常打骂他们，并阻止他们参加工会。
    对学徒的生活，本来是应适当解决的，可是文兴号的学徒，有的已工作了二年，连理发钱还得自己出。有一个姓赵的学徒，他曾向经理要钱理发，因此遭到无故解雇。姓赵的学徒不同意，把这件事提到工会。李文德就另想了一套办法，他对赵说：“现在已到麦季，你回家帮助收麦吧，过了麦季再去叫你回来。”李文德就这样地把这个学徒骗走了，连一个钱也没给。现在麦期已过，李文德又给赵捎信，告诉他不要回来了。
    我认为文兴家具铺经理李文德，如此阻止学徒参加工会，并任意骗走学徒事情，是不应有的现象，希望当地有关机关调查处理。

    最近我们陆续接到一些关于揭发控诉某些商店、作坊主人虐待学徒的来信。来信中指出，这些商店、作坊的主人，采取各种办法，侵犯学徒的合法权：他们任意延长学徒的工作时间，有的每日竟达十八小时以上；学徒的生活恶劣到极点，而他们并不加以必要的改善；他们限制工人参加工会；甚至，以极野蛮的态度，打骂学徒。这种对学徒的封建压迫，在新民主主义的社会，是绝不容许存在的，违法的商店、作坊主人，应受到法律制裁。
