Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, August 1st Dispatch: The Vietnamese Labor Party's newspaper "People's Weekly" published an editorial entitled "Hail the Chinese People's Liberation Army" to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on August 1st. The editorial began by saying, "Today, August 1st, the Vietnamese military and people extend their friendly greetings to the Chinese People's Liberation Army celebrating its 24th anniversary. The reason why the Chinese revolution has won a great victory is that China has a truly revolutionary party that masters Marxist-Leninist theory - the Chinese Communist Party, a broad and powerful national united front, and a revolutionary army of the people - an army that masters correct strategies and tactics, and is brave and decisive."

The editorial, after outlining the glorious history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for twenty-four years, said: "Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, after twenty-four years of long and arduous struggle, shattered the world's largest feudal regime and drove out the most arrogant American imperialism in the world. The reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army has won such a brilliant victory is that it has the leadership and education of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhu De, it has correct policies and strategies in line with Marxism-Leninism, it has close internal unity, it has close ties and strong unity with the people, and it is fully supported by the people. It has a very strict conscious discipline and a high degree of fighting spirit that does not stop until victory."

The editorial further stated: "At present, the Chinese People's Volunteers, who are fighting heroically for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, are inheriting the heroic tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army."

The editorial concluded: "Like the Chinese people, we, the Vietnamese people, are also engaged in a long and arduous battle. We also have a truly revolutionary party - the Vietnamese Labor Party, a solid national united front - the Vietnamese National United Front, a heroic army - our regular People's Army, as well as our local People's Army, militia, and guerrillas; we have the leadership and education of President Ho Chi Minh and the command of General Vo Nguyen Giap. We are also learning from the valuable experience and determination of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. That is why our war of liberation will also surely win victory."

　　越南“人民周刊”发表社论
    赞扬我军伟大胜利
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社北越一日电：越南劳动党机关报“人民周报”以“欢呼中国人民解放军”为题发表社论，纪念中国人民解放军“八一”建军二十四周年。社论开头说：“今天八月一日，越南军民向庆祝建军二十四周年的中国人民解放军致以友谊的敬礼。中国革命所以赢得伟大的胜利，是因为中国有一个掌握马列主义理论的、真正革命的党——中国共产党，有一个广泛而有力的民族统一战线，有一支人民的革命军队——一支掌握正确的战略与战术的、英勇果敢的军队。”
    社论在概述中国人民解放军二十四年的光荣历史后说：“中国人民解放军在中国共产党与毛泽东主席的领导下，经过二十四年的长期而艰苦的斗争，粉碎了世界最大的封建政权，驱逐了世界上最傲慢的美帝国主义。中国人民解放军所以赢得这种辉煌的胜利，是因为它有毛泽东同志和朱德同志的领导与教育，它有符合于马列主义的正确的政策与战略，它的内部密切团结，它与人民有密切的联系与坚强的团结，并受到人民的充分拥护。它有非常严格的自觉的纪律，和非到胜利不止的高度的战斗精神。”
    社论进一步说：“目前在为抗美援朝而英勇战斗的中国人民志愿军，正继承着中国人民解放军的英勇传统。”
    社论结语说：“象中国人民一样，我们越南人民也在进行持久而艰苦的战斗。我们也有一个真正革命的党——越南劳动党，一个坚固的民族统一战线——越南国民联合战线，一支英勇的军队——我们的正规人民军，以及我们的地方人民军、民兵与游击队；我们有胡志明主席的领导与教育，武元甲将军的指挥。我们也在学习中国人民解放军的宝贵经验与决心。这就是为什么我们的解放战争也一定会赢得胜利的原因。”
