Reflections on the Case of the U.S. Government's Espionage Plot for Riots in Beijing
    Luo Longji
    I am not at all surprised by the news published in yesterday's (August 18th) newspaper regarding the U.S. imperialist special agent's espionage plot for riots in Beijing. Because the nature of imperialism is precisely such a thing. "Imperialist robber" is a commonly used and practical term. There is a reason for adding the word "robber" after "imperialism." This is using a popular term to explain the essence of imperialism. Ordinary robbers are individual or small gang thugs; imperialism is a large-scale collective cooperative thug with the state as the organizational unit. Are we surprised when we hear that a certain robber has killed and looted? We are not only not surprised, but we also think it is inevitable. We would only be surprised to hear of a robber who doesn't kill or rob. Imperialism survives by aggression. The only method of aggression is killing. It's just that the method of killing is different. Breeding puppets to kill the people of other countries; using bandit special agents to kill the people of other countries; launching wars to kill the people of other countries, these are the frequent tricks of imperialists.
    The U.S. imperialist government cannot conceal its plot to murder. Otherwise, what would Truman, Acheson, Marshall, Eisenhower, Bradley, and this large group of people be busy with day and night? The more than 50 billion U.S. dollars in military spending recently passed by the U.S. Congress is for the expense of killing people. This is of course mainly the cost of launching a world war, and it of course also includes the expenses of dispatching special agents and spies to plot riots and assassinations in other countries. Therefore, in other countries, especially in independent, autonomous, peace-loving, and democratic countries, imperialists will continue to plot destruction and sabotage.
    Despite Marshal Stalin's sincere statement that "the two systems of socialism and capitalism can coexist," imperialists think differently. In the future world, there can be no fascism where there is democracy, and there can be no war where there is peace. In the eyes of imperialists, true democracy is their true enemy; true peace is their true opponent. Imperialism is cultivated with human blood and survives by killing. There will never be imperialism that does not engage in war, espionage, or plots of riots and assassinations.
    The United States today is the typical imperialist in the world. The civilization represented by U.S. imperialism is the life of underground gangsters in large cities like New York and Chicago. In cities like New York and Chicago, it is common to see robbers using armored vehicles and machine guns to kill and rob in broad daylight. U.S. imperialists dream of bringing their special skills and unique techniques to Tiananmen Square in the capital of our People's Republic of China to perform, in order to achieve their conspiracy of destruction. This was discovered by our people's public security organs. This of course gave the imperialists a serious blow and lesson, making them realize that there is absolutely no hope of succeeding in such a despicable and shameless trick in today's New China.
    The case of the U.S. imperialist government's espionage plot for riots cracked in Beijing this time confirms the U.S. imperialists' perverse actions and exhaustion. The puppet show of using the Chiang bandit reactionary regime has long collapsed. The war of aggression against Korea has also been severely hit by the Chinese and Korean people. The New Democratic New China is becoming stronger day by day. The world war in the dreams of U.S. imperialists is restricted by the great peace power of the people of the world and cannot be launched immediately at risk. In this embarrassing situation, U.S. imperialists then engage in these tricks of espionage, banditry, and plotting riots. Perverse actions precisely illustrate his exhaustion. This is precisely a symptom of the collapse and death of imperialism.
    These words do not mean that the Chinese people should not be more vigilant against U.S. imperialists in the future. U.S. imperialists will of course continue to engage in their final struggle today. He has openly supported the Chiang bandits in Taiwan with a large amount of money and weapons. He has openly announced that he will support and instigate the sabotage of the remaining bandits and thieves within China. He has determined to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan on September 4 to implement armed Japan. In the future, the reactionary forces in Washington, Tokyo, and Taiwan will be a trinity to make trouble for the People's Republic of China, which we can imagine. Therefore, the Chinese people's vigilance must be increased, and the Chinese people's work against special agents must be intensified, which is also a matter of course. Any conspiracy of U.S. imperialists cannot get a chance to succeed in New China. The fact that the Chinese People's Military and Public Security Organs cracked the Li An-tung case this time has clearly confirmed this.
    This time, the Chinese people's public security organs have dealt with the U.S. imperialists' espionage conspiracy so vigilantly and quickly, and our people's military courts and people's procuratorial organs have handled this case so legally, reasonably, fairly, and correctly. This is indeed a matter of great joy for the entire Chinese people. We express our deep respect and gratitude to the personnel responsible for leading and working in these organs.

　　关于美国政府间谍在北京阴谋暴动案的感想
    罗隆基
    我看到昨天（八月十八）报纸所发表的美帝国主义者特务间谍在北京阴谋暴动案这个消息，我一点不诧异。因为帝国主义的本质就是这样一种东西。“帝国主义强盗”这是一个通用的而且适合实际的名词。“帝国主义”底下加上“强盗”两个字是有道理的。这是用个通俗的名词说明帝国主义的本质。通常的强盗是个人或小伙的暴徒；帝国主义是以国家为组织单位的大规模集体合作的暴徒。平常我们听到某某强盗杀人掠货，我们觉得奇怪吗？我们不止不奇怪，并且认为事所必然。只有听到不杀人不行劫的强盗，我们才觉得奇怪。帝国主义是靠侵略而生存的。侵略的唯一方法是杀人。只是杀人的方式不同罢了。豢蓄傀儡杀害别国的人民；利用匪特间谍杀害别国的人民；发动战争杀害别国的人民，这是帝国主义者经常的勾当。
    美帝国主义者的政府对图谋杀人这事是无法隐讳的。不然，则杜鲁门、艾奇逊、马歇尔、艾森豪威尔、布莱德雷这一大批人彻日彻夜地忙些什么？最近美国国会通过的五百多亿美元的军费就是杀人的用费。这主要当然是发动世界战争的费用，这里当然亦包括着派遣特务间谍在别的国家图谋暴动实行暗杀的开支。所以帝国主义者在别的国家，特别在独立自主爱和平行民主的国家，他们是要继续不断地阴谋摧毁破坏的。
    尽管斯大林大元帅诚恳地说“社会主义和资本主义这两种制度可以共存”，但帝国主义者的想法是不同的。今后的世界，有民主就不可能有法西斯，有和平就不能有战争。在帝国主义者看来，真民主就是他们的真仇人；真和平就是他们的真对头。帝国主义靠人血培养，靠杀人生存。世界上决不会有不搞战争，不搞间谍，不搞阴谋暴动暗杀这类把戏的帝国主义。
    美国今天是世界上典型的帝国主义者，代表美帝国主义的文明是纽约和芝加哥这类大城中的地下帮匪们的生活。在纽约和芝加哥这些城市中，在光天化日之下，强盗们用装甲车机关枪杀人劫货是经常见到的事。美帝国主义者梦想把他们的特长绝技搬到我们中华人民共和国首都的天安门来表演，以达其破坏的阴谋。这却为我们人民的公安机关破获了。这当然给帝国主义者一个严重的打击和教训，使他们知道这类卑鄙无耻的勾当在今天的新中国是绝对没有侥幸成功的希望的。
    这次北京破获的美帝国主义政府的间谍阴谋暴动案，证实了美帝国主义者的倒行逆施的日暮途穷。利用蒋匪反动政权的傀儡把戏早已垮台了。发动侵略朝鲜的战争又已经受到了中朝人民的惨重打击。新民主主义的新中国一天比一天更强大起来了。美帝国主义者梦想中的世界战争，他受制于世界人民伟大和平力量已不能冒险立即发动了。美帝国主义者在此窘迫情况下，于是就来搞这些间谍匪特阴谋暴动的把戏。倒行逆施正说明他的日暮途穷。这正是帝国主义崩溃死亡的症象。
    这些话不是说我们中国人民今后对美帝国主义者不要提高警惕。美帝国主义者今天当然还要从事最后挣扎。他已公开的用大量金钱和武器支持台湾蒋匪。他已公开宣布要支持并鼓动中国境内残余土匪盗贼的捣乱行为。他已确定于九月四日签订单独对日和约以实行武装日本。今后华盛顿，东京和台湾的反动力量是三位一体地来向中华人民共和国捣乱，这是我们可以想像得到的。因此，中国人民的警惕更要提高，中国人民反对特务的工作更要加紧，这亦是当然的事。美帝国主义者任何阴谋诡计，不能在新中国得到侥幸成功的机会，这次中国人民军事和公安机关破获李安东案已明显地证实了。
    这次，中国人民的公安机关对美帝国主义者的间谍阴谋应付得这般机警迅速，而我们人民的军事法庭和人民检察机关对这案件又处理得这般合法合理公平正确，这的确是全中国人民值得忻慰的事。对这些机关负责领导和工作的人员，我们人民深表敬佩和感谢。
