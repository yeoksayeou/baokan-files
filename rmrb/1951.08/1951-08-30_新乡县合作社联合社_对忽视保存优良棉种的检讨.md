Response to criticisms and suggestions from People's Daily readers:

To the Editor:

Li Qingxuan's comments published in the People's Daily reader's letters column on June 16th, regarding "Xinxiang County United Cooperative should improve cotton purchasing work and preserve the superior cotton seeds in the superior seed management areas," are basically correct, and we accept them. We now explain our investigation and improvement of this matter as follows:

This year, our county has a large target for purchasing ginned cotton. Although the superior cooperative had instructed us to purchase seed cotton in the superior cotton management areas to ensure the promotion of superior seeds, we did not earnestly implement this instruction. The reasons are:

First, there is a serious single-minded task-oriented viewpoint in our purchasing work. At the beginning of the pre-purchase, we also proposed to order seed cotton in the superior cotton management areas; however, later, because the cotton farmers were not accustomed to selling seed cotton, and in addition, they suffered losses from selling seed cotton last year, the cotton farmers had some concerns, and it was relatively difficult to pre-purchase seed cotton. We were just afraid of not completing the task, so we did not deeply publicize the policies and break through the thinking of the cotton farmers; instead, we followed the masses and became the tail of the masses.

Second, we did not deeply study the instructions of the superior cooperative, and there was a laissez-faire attitude. The National Cooperative and the Provincial United Cooperative clearly instructed that seed cotton should be pre-purchased in the superior cotton management areas. However, we only focused on completing the task and did not carefully study why the superior cooperative wanted to pre-purchase seed cotton in the superior cotton management areas; therefore, we deviated from the instructions of the superior cooperative and arbitrarily came up with a set of methods. This shows that our policy viewpoint is not strong.

Since seeing the criticism in the newspaper, we have conducted an inspection of the pre-purchase work at the cooperative affairs meeting and studied methods to correct the neglect of the preservation of superior cotton seeds. On July 19th, we convened a joint meeting of village cooperative directors, member representatives, and cotton farmer representatives in the superior cotton management area to explain the significance of pre-purchasing seed cotton. The county cooperative also formulated specific solutions based on the cotton farmers' concerns reflected by everyone.

Comrade Li Qingxuan's letter stated: The Xinxiang Prefectural Cotton Improvement Agency had studied this matter with our cooperative, and said that Director Ren Yun of our cooperative believed that there was no certainty in the ginning outturn when purchasing seed cotton, and that the masses were not accustomed to it, etc. This is not consistent with the facts, and the Cotton Improvement Agency did not discuss this matter with Director Ren Yun of our cooperative.

### 新乡县合作社联合社  对忽视保存优良棉种的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　新乡县合作社联合社
    对忽视保存优良棉种的检讨编辑同志：
    人民日报六月十六日读者来信栏内登载的李青轩同志对“新乡县联社应改进收棉工作，保存良种管理区的优良棉种”的意见，基本上是正确的，我们表示接受。今将我们对此事的检查及改进情况说明如下：
    今年我县预购皮棉的任务较大，上级合作社虽然曾指示在良棉管理区要预购籽棉，以保证良种的推广，但我们却没有认真执行这一指示。其原因是：
    一、我们的收购工作中存在着严重的单纯任务观点。在开始预购时，也曾提出要在良棉管理区订购籽棉；但后来因为棉农不习惯售籽棉，又加上去年售籽棉吃了亏，棉农有些顾虑，预购籽棉比较困难。我们只是怕完不成任务，所以就没有深入地宣传政策，打通棉农思想；而是跟群众跑，作了群众的尾巴。
    二、对上级合作社指示没有深入研究，存在着自由主义的思想。全国合作总社及省联社曾明文指示，在良棉管理区要预购籽棉。但我们只顾完成任务，没有很好地研究上级社为啥要在良棉管理区预购籽棉；因而脱离了上级社指示，自己随便想了一套作法。这说明了我们政策观点不强。
    我们自看到报纸上的批评后，即在社务会议上对预购工作作了检查，并研究了纠正忽视优良棉种保存工作的方法。七月十九日我们召开了良棉管理区村社主任、社员代表、棉农代表联席会，说明预购籽棉的意义。县社又根据大家反映的棉农思想顾虑情况，定出了具体解决办法。
    李青轩同志的信里说：新乡专署棉业改进社曾与我社研究过这件事，并说我社任云主任认为收购籽棉衣分没把握，而且群众不习惯等等，这与事实不符，棉业改进社并未和我社任云主任谈过此事。
