　　Catholic Believers in Various Districts of Beijing Gather and Sign Petitions
    Demanding the Expulsion of the Spy, Archbishop Liberio Antonelli, from China
    Exposing Archbishop Liberio Antonelli’s Despicable Crimes of Undermining the Patriotic Reform Movement of Catholic Believers

    [Our Newspaper's Report] In the past few days, Catholic believers in various districts and churches in Beijing have been gathering and signing petitions demanding the expulsion of the imperialist elements and spies within the Catholic Church, specifically Archbishop Liberio Antonelli, from China.

    Archbishop Liberio Antonelli, the Papal Nuncio to China, is an imperialist element concealed within the Catholic Church. He not only directs the imperialist lackeys to engage in espionage and sabotage activities harmful to the People's Republic of China under the guise of Catholicism, but also uses every despicable and shameless means to obstruct and undermine the patriotic reform movement of Catholic believers. After the Catholic believers in Nanjing exposed Archbishop Liberio Antonelli's crimes in July of this year, the broad masses of patriotic Catholic believers in Beijing expressed great anger towards Archbishop Liberio Antonelli in various gatherings. On the 17th of this month, the Beijing Military Control Commission's Military Tribunal sentenced a case of American special agent spies plotting an armed rebellion, in which the third criminal, Fr. Martinucci, was Archbishop Liberio Antonelli's representative in Beijing. Fr. Martinucci consistently used Catholicism as a cover to collude with the Japanese invading army and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, not only engaging in espionage activities, but also organizing armed plainclothes teams in Yi County to harass the Liberated Areas. In Beijing, he conducted espionage activities for the American government and hid military weapons for Li An-dong, who served as an American government special agent spy and plotted an armed rebellion. Fr. Martinucci's crimes were heinous, and he has been sentenced to life imprisonment by the Military Control Commission's Military Tribunal. The patriotic Catholic believers in Beijing, upon seeing that this major counter-revolutionary criminal was Archbishop Liberio Antonelli's representative in Beijing, felt deeply grieved and extremely resentful, believing that Archbishop Liberio Antonelli and Fr. Martinucci, these imperialist elements, were the dregs who were destroying the Catholic Church and were enemies of all the Chinese people, as well as public enemies of the Catholic believers. Therefore, in recent days, patriotic believers in various districts in urban and suburban Beijing have been continuously holding meetings to denounce Archbishop Liberio Antonelli's crimes and launching a signature campaign, unanimously demanding that the government severely punish the imperialist element Archbishop Liberio Antonelli according to the law or permanently expel him from China. As of yesterday, the vast number of patriotic Catholic believers from more than twenty Catholic churches in various districts in urban and suburban Beijing had signed petitions demanding the expulsion of Archbishop Liberio Antonelli, reaching several thousand people. Thirteen reform小组 leaders from Fu Jen Catholic University held a symposium, at which they unanimously voted to firmly demand that the government expel Archbishop Liberio Antonelli from the country. Shi Degui, a believer from the Second District, said in the meeting: "We must immediately expel Archbishop Liberio Antonelli from the country, not even for a moment longer." Believers from the Fourth District expressed indignantly: "Archbishop Liberio Antonelli's actions in China are simply not missionary work, we must resolutely expel him." Dong Zhongfeng, a believer from the Eighth District, said at the meeting: "We cannot leave even one imperialist element like Archbishop Liberio Antonelli, who is an enemy of the Chinese people; they must all get out of China." "Archbishop Liberio Antonelli is the dregs of the Catholic Church, and the Chinese Catholic believers will never allow him to exist in China." They denounced Archbishop Liberio Antonelli for obstructing and undermining the patriotic reform movement of Catholic believers and slandering the reform movement as "schism" and "destruction of the church." Enlightened believers said, "Now the facts prove that it is Archbishop Liberio Antonelli and Fr. Martinucci, these dregs of the Catholic Church, who are causing schism and destroying the church. Because they teach us Chinese believers to split from the entire Chinese people, not allowing us to love China, but telling us to love their imperialism." The movement to expel Archbishop Liberio Antonelli by Catholic believers in various churches is being widely carried out throughout the city and has now reached a climax.

    揭发黎培里破坏天主教徒爱国革新运动卑鄙罪行
    【本报讯】北京市各区各天主教堂的教徒，这几天正在纷纷集会，签名要求驱逐天主教中的帝国主义分子和间谍黎培里出中国。
    罗马教廷驻华公使黎培里，是掩藏在天主教中的帝国主义分子，他不仅指挥帝国主义的走狗在天主教的外衣下进行危害中华人民共和国的间谍破坏活动，而且使用一切卑劣无耻的手段阻挠与破坏天主教徒的爱国革新运动。南京的天主教徒在今年七月揭发黎培里的罪行之后，北京天主教的广大爱国教徒即曾在各种集会中对黎培里表示极大的愤怒；本月十七日北京市军事管制委员会军法处判决美国特务间谍阴谋武装暴动案，其中第三名罪犯马迪懦，就是黎培里的驻北京代表，马迪懦一向以天主教为掩护先后勾结日本侵略军和蒋介石匪帮，不仅进行间谍活动，而且在易县组织武装便衣队，侵扰解放区，在北京为美国政府进行间谍活动，并为充当美国政府特务间谍、阴谋武装暴动的李安东隐藏军火武器，马迪懦罪大恶极，已被军管会军法处判处无期徒刑。北京市的爱国天主教徒看到这个重大的反革命罪犯，就是黎培里的驻北京代表，莫不痛心疾首，愤恨非常，认为黎培里和马迪懦这些帝国主义分子，正是破坏天主教的败类，是全中国人民的敌人，同时是天主教徒的公敌。因此连日以来，北京城郊各区的爱国教徒不断地举行会议，控诉黎培里的罪恶，并发动签名，一致要求政府对帝国主义分子黎培里依法予以严惩或永远驱逐其出中国。截至昨日为止，北京市城郊各区二十多个天主教教堂广大的爱国教徒，签名要求驱逐黎培里的已达数千人。辅仁大学十三个革新小组长召开座谈会，在会上全体一致表决，坚决要求政府驱逐黎培里出境，二区教徒史德桂在会议中说：“我们要立刻把黎培里驱逐出境，一会儿也不要留”。四区教徒们愤激地表示：“黎培里在中国的这些行为，根本就不是传教，我们一定要坚决把他驱逐出去”，八区教徒董仲峰在会上说：“像黎培里这样与中国人民为敌的帝国主义分子，一个也不能留，都要让他们滚出中国去”。“黎培里是天主教的败类，中国的天主教徒决不能容许他在中国存在”。他们控诉黎培里阻挠破坏天主教的爱国革新运动，并诬蔑革新运动是“裂教”“灭教”，觉悟的教徒们说“现在事实证明，裂教灭教的就是黎培里和马迪懦这批天主教的败类。因为他们教我们中国教徒和全中国人民分裂，不叫我们爱中国，叫我们去爱他们帝国主义。”各堂的天主教徒驱逐黎培里的运动正在全市广泛开展，目前已达到高潮状态。
