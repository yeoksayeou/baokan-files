　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th—This reporter has learned from the Korean Front Headquarters: The 25th meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations began at 10:00 AM (Korean time) on August 15th and ended at 11:40 AM. The 26th meeting is scheduled to be held at 12:00 AM on August 16th.

　　In the 25th meeting, no progress was made on the second item on the agenda, namely, the issue of establishing a military demarcation line to create a demilitarized zone. General Nam Il, chief representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, sternly criticized the other party's error of isolating tactical bombing from strategic bombing, and pointed out: Whether tactical bombing or strategic bombing, the result is ultimately manifested in the operations of the ground forces. The reason why the other side can barely maintain its existing positions temporarily—is solely dependent on the full military effectiveness of the naval and air force's indiscriminate bombing. The only effectiveness not reflected in the existing positions is the indiscriminate bombing of peaceful Korean residents and towns by the other side's naval and air forces, but this effectiveness is not any military effectiveness, but a sheer manifestation of brutality. Those who have committed such heinous crimes in Korea have no reason to shamelessly demand compensation based on such brutality.

　　General Nam Il reiterated that, in order to prevent the meeting from stalling and to enter into the discussion of other items on the agenda as soon as possible, the other party should fundamentally abandon its absurd and arrogant plan and reconsider and accept our fair and reasonable plan of taking the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line.

　　美国海空军狂轰滥炸只能对朝鲜和平居民施行残暴
    南日将军痛斥美方厚颜无耻要求
    为使会议免于停顿再度建议美方重新考虑我方方案
    【新华社平壤十五日电】本社记者自朝鲜前线总部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议第二十五次会议在八月十五日上午十时（朝鲜时间）开始，十一时四十分结束。第二十六次会议定于八月十六日上午十二时举行。
    第二十五次会议中对于议程的第二项确立双方军事分界线以建立非军事地区问题，仍未获得任何进展。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军严词指斥对方将战术轰炸与战略轰炸孤立起来看待的错误，并指出：无论战术轰炸或战略轰炸，其结果都是最后地表现于地面部队的作战的。对方的所以能够勉强暂时维持着现有阵地——也只是依赖了海空军狂轰滥炸的全部军事效能。唯一没有表现在现有阵地上的效能是对方海空军对于朝鲜和平居民与城镇的狂轰滥炸，但这种效能却不是任何军事效能，而是不折不扣的施行残暴的效能。在朝鲜犯下如此滔天罪恶者，更没有任何理由根据这种残暴厚颜要求补偿。
    南日将军再度建议，为了使会议免于停顿，早日进入议程中其他各项的讨论，对方应根本放弃其荒谬狂妄的方案，而重新考虑并接受我方以三八线为军事分界线的公平合理的方案。
