Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd - Since the Tianjin Military Control Commission issued an order on July 13th to ban the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary," 1,873 "members" have declared their withdrawal from the "Legion" (including 13 foreigners); 349 "officers" of the "Legion of Mary" at the branch level and above have registered with the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau (including 9 foreigners), and 23 "spiritual directors" have registered (including 6 foreigners); 21 "army flags" and more than 660 kinds of reactionary pamphlets have been handed over. From these incomplete registration materials alone, it has been found that as many as 64 people in the "Legion of Mary" have the identities of spies, members of reactionary secret societies, and traitors. These materials further confirm the fact that the "Legion of Mary" is engaged in counter-revolutionary activities.

The vast number of Catholics and the majority of "members" and "officers" in the "Legion of Mary" in Tianjin actively support the government's correct measures to ban the "Legion of Mary." They have come forward to expose the crimes of the "Legion of Mary," and have expressed deep remorse for their past participation in this reactionary organization. Sun JiaShan, the secretary of a branch of the Second District Committee of the "Legion of Mary," voluntarily handed over the list of 33 "members" and "officers" of the branch, three reactionary documents, and one handbook when registering, and reported the important members of five branches. Some "members" not only confessed themselves, but also helped others. For example, after declaring her withdrawal from the "Legion," "member" Wang Ling immediately mobilized Chen Huizhen, the president of the "Bitter Sea Heart" branch, to register with the government. Some corrected their mistakes of underreporting their status and concealing the truth. For example, Chen Bingxiu, Chen Suzhen, and others who declared their withdrawal from the "Legion" were able to consciously state that they were "officers" after education and requested re-registration.

However, as of today, there are still a very small number of people who have not declared their withdrawal from the "Legion" or registered with the government. The Municipal Public Security Bureau is currently reviewing and handling the matter. Certain imperialist elements and their individual loyal lackeys are still plotting sabotage, creating rumors, and inciting trouble. They not only prevent others from registering, but also continue to attempt to hide within the Catholic Church to carry out criminal activities against the Chinese people. The People's Government will severely punish these incorrigible imperialist elements and counter-revolutionaries.

　　天津近二千“圣母军团员”退出反动组织
    交出的证件充分暴露“圣母军”的反革命罪行
    【新华社天津二日电】自天津市军事管制委员会于七月十三日明令取缔反动组织“圣母军”以来，声明退“团”的“团员”已有一千八百七十三人（内有外籍十三人）；向市人民政府公安局进行登记的“圣母军”支会以上“职员”有三百四十九人（内有外籍九人），登记的“指导司铎”有二十三人（内有外籍六人）；交出“军旗”二十一面，各种反动小册子六百六十余册。仅从这些不完整的登记材料中，已查明“圣母军”中具有特务、反动会道门分子、汉奸等身份者即达六十四人。这些材料并进一步证实了“圣母军”从事反革命活动的事实。
    天津市广大天主教徒和“圣母军”中绝大多数的“团员”和“职员”，都积极拥护政府取缔“圣母军”的正确措施，他们纷纷起来揭露“圣母军”的罪恶；对于他们自己曾参加这一反动组织的错误行为，都表示深切悔恨。“圣母军”第二区会某支会秘书孙家珊在登记时，自动交出该支会三十三名“团员”、“职员”的名册、反动证件三件、手册一本，并检举了五个支会的重要分子。有的“团员”不但自己坦白，而且还帮助别人，如“团员”王玲在声明退“团”以后，立即动员“苦海之心”支会会长陈惠珍向政府登记。有的改正了低报身份，隐瞒真实情况的错误。如声明退“团”的陈炳秀、陈素珍等，经过教育后，均能自觉地说出自己是“职员”，请求重新登记。
    但截至今天，尚有极少数分子还没有声明退“团”或向政府办理登记，市公安局正审查处理中。某些帝国主义分子及其个别忠实走狗仍图阴谋破坏，造谣煽动。他们不仅阻止别人登记，并仍企图继续隐蔽在天主教内进行反对中国人民的罪恶活动。对于这些怙恶不悛的帝国主义分子和反革命分子，人民政府将予以严厉惩办。
