    Yi Compatriots Love People's Films

To the Editor:

    Our film education work team from the Political Department of the Xikang Military Region showed the film "The Victory of the Chinese People" to Yi compatriots in Zhaojue, Liangshan area, and it was warmly welcomed by the Yi compatriots.

    April 16th was the opening day of the Zhaojue Yi Autonomous Region People's Representative Conference. Our film education work team screened the film "The Victory of the Chinese People" for five days during the conference. The Yi compatriots were extremely happy and enthusiastically came to see the film. Many Yi people living within thirty to fifty *li* locked their doors and came with their whole families to watch the film, and many Yi people traveled three or four days over mountains and rivers to get to Zhaojue. Before each screening, we explained the content of the film in the Yi language, so the effect was very good. After watching the film, the Yi compatriots loved Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party even more, and had a clearer understanding of the vastness and richness of the motherland. When Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, the whole audience burst into thunderous applause and shouted the slogan "Chairman Mao, *Wa Ku* (Long Live)!"

    彝族同胞热爱人民电影编辑同志：
    我们西康军区政治部电影教育工作队在凉山地区的昭觉为彝族同胞放映了电影《中国人民的胜利》，受到了彝族同胞的热烈欢迎。
    四月十六日，是昭觉彝族自治区各界人民代表会议开幕的日子。我们电影教育工作队就在会议期间放映电影《中国人民的胜利》五天。彝族同胞们高兴极了，都热情地赶来看电影。住在三、五十里以内的彝胞，很多把家里的门锁上后全家人都来看电影，还有不少彝胞爬山涉水走了三四天赶到昭觉来。每次放映前，我们都用彝语说明电影内容，因此收效很好。彝胞们看了电影后，都更加热爱毛主席、中国共产党，更加认清了祖国的辽阔富饶。当毛主席在银幕上出现时，全场掌声雷鸣，并且响起了“毛主席哇库（万岁）！”的口号声。
