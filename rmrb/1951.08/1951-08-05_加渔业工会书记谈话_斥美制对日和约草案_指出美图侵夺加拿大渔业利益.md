Xinhua News Agency, Prague dispatch: According to a Vancouver dispatch in the July 30th issue of the *Canadian Tribune*: Stevens, the secretary of the United Fishermen and Allied Workers' Union, denounced the US-drafted "Peace Treaty" with Japan as "completely betraying Canadian fisheries interests." He said: Canada should reject this treaty. Stevens said: There is ample evidence that Japanese industrialists plan to collude with American industrialists in a "shameless attempt to control Pacific fisheries and thus monopolize the world's supply of salmon." Stevens added: Kobayashi, formerly a representative of Mitsui, has suggested to American industrialists a plan to control the world salmon market. This suggestion advocated a jointly funded investment plan, which Kobayashi said would ultimately mean that "the world market's supply of canned salmon would have to rely on the US-Japan salmon industry." Stevens said that while making suggestions to American industrialists, Japan also enticingly told them that maintaining the wages of Japanese cannery workers and fishermen at the level of slave labor could eliminate competition. Stevens also said: "This means that after the treaty is signed, we will have no guarantee of peace and security in the Pacific."

　　加渔业工会书记谈话
    斥美制对日和约草案
    指出美图侵夺加拿大渔业利益
    【新华社讯】布拉格消息：据七月三十日《加拿大论坛报》温哥华消息：渔民与同业工人统一工会书记斯蒂文斯，斥责美国对日“和约”草案“完全出卖了加拿大渔业利益”。他说：加拿大应该拒绝这个和约。斯蒂文斯说：有许多证据可以证明日本工业家计划与美国工业家勾结在一起，“无耻地企图控制太平洋渔业，并从而垄断世界上鲑鱼的供应”。斯蒂文斯又说：过去曾为三井公司代表的小林已向美国工业家建议控制世界鲑鱼市场的计划。这个建议主张对一个计划联合投资，据小林说：这个计划最后将意味着“世界市场在罐头鲑鱼的供应上将不得不依靠美日鲑鱼工业”。斯蒂文斯说：日本在向美国工业家提出建议的同时，并引诱地告诉他们说，使日本罐头业工人及渔民的工资保持在奴隶劳工的水平，就可以消灭竞争。斯蒂文斯还说：“这意味着：在签订和约以后，我们在太平洋上将没有和平与安全的保证。”
