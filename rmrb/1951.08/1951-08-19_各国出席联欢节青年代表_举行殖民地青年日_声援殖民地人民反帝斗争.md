Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Youth representatives from various countries attending the World Youth and Students for Peace Festival held Colonial Youth Day on the 16th, expressing the support of peace-loving youth around the world for the heroic struggle of the people of colonial and dependent countries against imperialism and for freedom and independence. According to a TASS dispatch from Berlin: Youths from thirty colonial and dependent countries in Asia, Africa, and other regions held a youth conference of colonial and dependent countries in Treptow Park. Thousands of German youths were invited to attend the conference. Billinguer, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, delivered an opening speech, expressing his greetings to the representatives present.

Subsequently, representatives of Asian and African youth delivered speeches successively. At the end of each speech, they called for a resolute struggle to defend peace and oppose imperialist aggression.

At the end of the conference, all participants enthusiastically adopted a letter to the youth of the world. The letter to the youth of the world stated: The youth of colonial and dependent countries who are struggling for peace and national independence have united. We believe that every nation has the basic right to national independence. Any nation that oppresses another nation and carries out colonial oppression and colonial wars against the people endangers the foundation of peace. Therefore, we demand an immediate end to the Korean War and the withdrawal of all foreign troops. We pay tribute to the heroic Korean youth. The letter to the youth of the world continued: Imperialism can never again use the youth of colonial and dependent countries as cannon fodder. The youth of colonial and dependent countries will never allow war-mongers to interfere in their territory and the resources of their country. The letter to the youth of the world finally called on the youth of the world to strengthen their ranks, unite all peace-loving youth, and fight for the conclusion of a peace treaty between the five major powers, for national independence, justice, peace, and equality.

    声援殖民地人民反帝斗争
    【新华社十八日讯】参加世界青年与学生和平联欢节的各国青年代表，于十六日举行殖民地青年日，表示了全世界爱好和平的青年声援殖民地和附属国人民反对帝国主义、争取自由独立的英勇斗争。据塔斯社柏林讯：来自亚洲、非洲等地的三十个殖民地和附属国的青年，在特列泡公园举行了殖民地和附属国的青年大会。数千德国青年应邀参加了大会。世界民主青年联盟主席比林格尔致开幕词，向到会的代表们致意。
    接着，亚洲青年和非洲青年的代表相继发表演说。每一个人在结束发言时，都号召为保卫和平、为反对帝国主义侵略而坚决斗争。
    大会结束时，全体与会者热烈地通过了告全世界青年书。告全世界青年书说：正在为争取和平与民族独立而斗争的殖民地附属国的青年已经团结起来了。我们认为：每一个民族都有民族独立的基本权利。凡是一个民族压迫另一个民族，对人民实施殖民压迫和殖民战争，都是危及和平的基础的，因此我们要求立即停止朝鲜战争并撤退一切外国军队。我们向英勇的朝鲜青年致敬。告全世界青年书接着说：帝国主义绝不可能再利用殖民地和附属国的青年们去充当炮灰了。殖民地和附属国的青年绝不容许战争贩子们染指于他们的国土和他们本国的资源。告全世界青年书最后号召全世界的青年紧密自己的队伍，把全体爱好和平的青年团结起来，为争取五大国缔结和平公约，为争取民族独立、正义和平等而斗争。
