Having Successfully Completed the Summer Patriotic Production Increase Competition Plan
    Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team Formulates Autumn Production Plan
    Challenging National Labor Models and Mutual Aid Teams, Suggesting Further Development of the Autumn Patriotic Production Competition.
    The Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team has now completed the Summer Patriotic Production Increase Competition Plan and, on the 16th of this month, wrote to national labor models and mutual aid teams, proposing to further develop the autumn patriotic production competition.
    From mid-June to August 12, the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team cultivated all autumn fields three times, ensuring the soil was loose and free of weeds. They also used improved weeding hoes, hollow hoes, and wide-blade hoes to weed 61.9 percent of the autumn field area (originally planned for 50 percent), thereby increasing the efficiency of cultivation by 30 percent compared to previous years, and shortening the time by seven days. The amount of top dressing per mu of autumn field exceeded the original plan by 4.7 percent, and 29 jin of asphalt was used to reduce the occurrence of underground pests. At the end of June, the team discovered that a small number of potato seedlings had 28-spotted ladybugs on them. They immediately organized eight women to catch them for four days, and finally eliminated all the pests. A small number of diseased plants of major autumn field crops such as corn and millet affected by head smut and white blight have also been removed and burned. In order to further increase yields, the entire team conducted a detasseling and seed selection experiment on one mu of land when the corn was tasseling and silking. Now the various crops of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team are growing vigorously, promising a good harvest. The corn planted by the whole team has already finished flowering and is bearing fruit, with green leaves and thick stalks, the tallest being nine chi. The millet has also headed, and the stalks are all over five chi high.
    After completing the summer production plan, the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team wrote to national labor models and mutual aid teams to further propose the development of the autumn patriotic production competition. The original letter is as follows: Brothers of labor models and mutual aid teams in various places!
    Since our team completed the summer seedling protection and after summing up the evaluation, the patriotic labor enthusiasm of the whole team is even higher. Now the various autumn crops in the fields have finished flowering and are bearing fruit, and autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and autumn plowing are about to begin. Autumn production is very complex and busy. In order to ensure that the fruits of a year of hard work can be harvested satisfactorily and to better support the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front, we must start early to ensure that the autumn harvest is good, the seeds are selected well, and that the wheat planting and autumn plowing, which are related to next year's large-scale production, are done well. Therefore, we hereby propose to you to further launch the autumn patriotic production competition.
    Our team's autumn harvest, autumn plowing (the whole team's autumn crops account for 89 percent of the total cultivated area), and wheat planting plans are as follows:
    (1) Before and during the autumn harvest, we must always prevent natural disasters such as wind, frost, and flooding, as well as wild animals in the mountains and forests. Young and middle-aged team members should organize autumn protection teams with the militia and patrol in shifts at night to strictly prevent sabotage by bad elements.
    (2) After the autumn crops are ripe, we must ensure that major crops such as corn and millet are harvested within 15 days, ensuring that the ground is clean and the threshing ground is clear, and that the grain is dried and winnowed.
    (3) Select and retain 500 jin of excellent varieties such as "Golden Queen" corn and Da Huang millet. In addition to supplying the team's needs for next year's production, a portion will be exchanged and promoted with mutual aid teams in nearby villages. The whole team must conduct single harvesting, single threshing, and single storage according to the seed selection standards in advance, so that the purity of excellent varieties reaches 100 percent and the uniformity reaches 90 percent or more. The grading of hemp must meet the national procurement specifications.
    (4) Immediately after the autumn harvest, conduct evaluation and summarization, evaluate and reward the model team members in the team, and at the same time promote the completion of the evaluation and summarization work of each team in the village.
    (5) After the agricultural tax (public grain) is levied, the whole team decided to pay all of it within one day, and deliver good and clean grain.
    (6) Plow all autumn fields as they are harvested, and generally plow 1.5 times.
    (7) Before sowing all wheat fields (accounting for 11 percent of the total cultivated area), plow, rake, and harrow a total of five times, apply 100 dan of fertilizer per mu of wheat field, sow all excellent varieties, and disinfect the seeds before sowing.
    (8) Do a good job of代耕 work to help the families of martyrs and soldiers.
    (9) Thin out 30 mu of forest in the autumn (pruning and thinning), and afforest 40 mu.
    (10) Compost 2,940 dan of artemisia fertilizer.
    In order to realize the above plan, we must first adhere to the political, current affairs, and cultural learning system, and continue to strengthen patriotic production education. Secondly, we must not miss the farming season, achieve unified planning and scientific division of labor for the whole team, and give full play to the efficiency of all labor, livestock, and various farm implements. Work such as wheat planting, forest management, afforestation, and composting artemisia fertilizer is planned to be completed before the autumn harvest. All necessary large and small farm implements for the autumn harvest, field roads, threshing grounds, and labor and livestock allocation preparations will be completed ten days before the autumn harvest. Five days before the start of the autumn harvest, the technical team will go to the fields to evaluate all the excellent varieties.
    What are your plans? We hope to get your reply to our suggestion!

### 李顺达互助组订出秋季生产计划

　　夏季爱国丰产竞赛计划胜利完成后
    李顺达互助组订出秋季生产计划
    向全国劳动模范和互助组挑战，建议进一步开展秋季爱国主义生产竞赛。
    李顺达互助组现已完成了夏季爱国丰产竞赛计划，并于本月十六日写信给全国劳动模范和互助组，提出进一步开展秋季爱国主义生产竞赛。
    李顺达互助组自六月中旬起至八月十二日，已将全部秋田中耕三次，做到草尽土松。他们并在百分之六十一点九的秋田面积上（原计划百分之五十）使用改良耘锄、空心锄和宽板锄锄草，中耕效率因此较往年提高了百分之三十，时间也比往年缩短七天。每亩秋田上的追肥量超过原计划百分之四点七，并使用柏油二十九斤，减少了地下害虫的发生。六月底，该组发现有少数山药蛋幼苗上长有二十八星瓢虫，当即组织了八个妇女捕捉了四天，终于将害虫全部消灭。少数发生黑穗病、白发病的玉蜀黍、谷子等主要秋田作物的病株亦已拔除烧毁。为了进一步提高产量，当玉蜀黍扬花抽穗时，全组曾在一亩地上进行去雄选种的试验。现在李顺达互助组的各种作物长得很茂盛，可望丰收。全组所种的玉蜀黍已经花谢结实，叶绿秆粗，最高的有九尺。谷子也已出穗，秆高都在五尺以上。
    李顺达互助组在完成了夏季生产计划以后，又写信向全国劳动模范和互助组进一步提出开展秋季爱国主义生产竞赛，原信如下：各地劳动模范和互助组的兄弟们！
    我们组自完成夏季保苗和经过总结评比后，全组的爱国劳动热情更高了。现在田里的各种秋禾已经花谢结实，就要开始秋收、种麦和秋耕等工作了。秋季生产是很复杂繁忙的，为了使辛勤劳动一年的果实，能够圆满收获，更好地支援我们在朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军，我们必须及早动手，保证把秋收收好，种籽选好，并做好关系明年大生产的种麦和秋耕工作。因此我们特向你们提出进一步展开秋季爱国主义生产竞赛。
    我们全组的秋收、秋耕（全组秋禾占总耕地面积的百分之八十九）和种麦计划如下：
    （一）秋收以前和秋收期中，要时刻防治风、霜、涝等自然灾害和山林野兽。青壮年组员要与民兵共同组织护秋小组，夜间分班巡逻，严防坏分子破坏。
    （二）秋禾成熟后，要保证玉蜀黍、谷子等主要作物在十五天内收藏完毕，作到地净场光，粮食要晒干扬净。
    （三）选留“金皇后”玉蜀黍、大黄谷子等优良品种五百斤，除供给全组明年生产的需用外，并以其中一部分与附近村的互助组调换推广。全组要事先按照选种的标准，进行单割、单打、单藏，使优良品种的纯度达到百分之百，整齐度达到百分之九十以上。大麻分等要做到合乎国家收购的规格。
    （四）秋收后立即进行评比总结，评选并奖励组内的模范组员，同时推动全村各组完成评比总结工作。
    （五）开征农业税（公粮）后，全组决定一天内全部交清，并交又好又干净的粮。
    （六）全部秋田随收、随耕，并且要普遍犁一点五遍。
    （七）全部麦田（占总耕地面积的百分之十一）播种前作到耕、耙、耪共五遍，每亩麦田施肥一百担，全部播种优良品种，下种前种籽要经过杀菌消毒。
    （八）做好帮助烈士及军人家属的代耕工作。
    （九）秋季整林（修枝间伐）三十亩，造林四十亩。
    （十）沤蒿肥二千九百四十担。
    为了实现上述计划，我们首先要坚持政治、时事、文化的学习制度，继续加强爱国丰产教育。其次要不误农时，做到全组统一计划，科学分工，发扬全部劳畜力和各种农具的效能。种麦、整林、造林、沤蒿肥等工作，计划在秋收以前全部做完。一切秋收必需的大小农具，田间道路，打秋场和劳畜力调配等准备工作，在秋收前十天完成。在开始秋收前五天，技术小组要到田间把全部优良品种评选完毕。
    你们的计划怎样？我们的这个建议，希望能得到你们的回答！
