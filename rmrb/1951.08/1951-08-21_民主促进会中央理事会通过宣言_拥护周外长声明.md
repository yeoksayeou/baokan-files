　　The China Association for Promoting Democracy Central Council Passes Declaration
    Endorsing Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Third Session of the Third Central Council of the China Association for Promoting Democracy passed a declaration endorsing Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference. The full text of the declaration is as follows:
    The United States will convene the so-called San Francisco Conference on September 4th, preparing to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan based on the one-sided "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" by the US and British governments. Our Central People's Government Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued a solemn statement on August 15th, pointing out that the "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" proposed by the US and British governments "is a draft that fundamentally cannot be accepted due to its violation of international agreements," and that "the San Francisco Conference is also a conference that fundamentally cannot be recognized due to its betrayal of international obligations." All council members attending the Third Session of the Third Central Council of the China Association for Promoting Democracy fully endorse this solemn and just declaration representing the 475 million people of the People's Republic of China!
    This time, the US imperialists, in collusion with the British imperialists, have arbitrarily drafted a peace treaty with Japan and convened the so-called San Francisco Conference, which is fundamentally unreasonable. We, the Chinese people, who fought against Japan for the longest time, suffered the greatest losses, and made the greatest contributions, are instead not allowed to participate in the preparation and signing of the peace treaty. This so-called San Francisco Conference is a completely absurd measure! As for the so-called "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan," whether in its preparation process or content, it intolerably violates important international agreements such as the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942, the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation and Agreement, and the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy towards Japan after surrender. The Central People's Government and the people of the whole country have repeatedly and resolutely opposed the US government's tyrannical actions of violating and undermining international agreements. In this statement, Foreign Minister Zhou further sternly criticized them based on the articles and specific facts of the "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" announced by the US and British governments, exposing their intention to harm the interests of the Allied countries that fought against Japan and the Japanese people, antagonize China and the Soviet Union, threaten the Asian people, and undermine peace in the Far East.
    As Foreign Minister Zhou stated in his declaration: "In this draft treaty, the US government and its vassal states are only pursuing one central goal, which is to rearm Japan in order to continue and expand the war of aggression in Asia and to intensify preparations for a new world war." The Chinese people absolutely cannot recognize the "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" proposed by the US and British governments, and absolutely cannot recognize any decisions made by the "San Francisco Conference" monopolized by US imperialism.
    We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and advocate convening a comprehensive peace conference including representatives of all countries that participated in the war against Japan with their armies. We, all members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, vow to fight to the end for the conclusion of a truly peaceful, comprehensive, and just peace treaty with Japan!

　　民主促进会中央理事会通过宣言
    拥护周外长声明
    【本报讯】中国民主促进会第三届第三次中央理事会通过拥护周恩来外长关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的声明的宣言。宣言原文如下：
    美国将于九月四日召集所谓旧金山会议，准备根据美英两国政府片面的《对日和约草案》，签订单独对日和约。我中央人民政府周恩来外交部长已于八月十五日发表了严正的声明，指出美英两国政府所提出的《对日和约草案》，“是一件破坏国际协定基本上不能被接受的草案”，而“旧金山会议也是一个背弃国际义务基本上不能被承认的会议”。我们出席中国民主促进会第三届第三次中央理事会的全体理事，完全拥护周外长这个代表中华人民共和国四亿七千五百万人民的庄严的正义的宣告！
    这次美国帝国主义会同英国帝国主义擅自拟定对日和约的草案和召开所谓旧金山会议，根本是没有道理的。我们对日作战最久，损失最大，贡献最多的中国人民反不得参加和约的准备和签订，这所谓旧金山会议完全是荒谬绝伦的举措！至于所谓“对日和约草案”，无论在它的准备程序上或内容上，都不可容忍地破坏了一九四二年一月一日的联合国宣言、开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告和协定以及远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策等重要的国际协定。对于美国政府违背和破坏国际协定的横暴行动，我中央人民政府和全国人民曾一再坚决反对，周外长在这次声明中，更根据这次美英两国政府所公布的“对日和约草案”的条文和具体事实，加以严斥，揭穿其损害对日作战的盟国及日本人民的利益，敌视中苏两国，威胁亚洲人民，破坏远东和平的意图。
    诚如周外长在声明中所说：“美国政府及其附庸国家在这个和约草案中，只追求一个中心目标，即是重新武装日本，以便继续和扩大在亚洲的侵略战争，并加紧准备新的世界战争”。中国人民绝对不能承认美英两国政府所提出的“对日和约草案”，绝对不能承认由美国帝国主义垄断的“旧金山会议”所作的一切决定。
    我们坚决拥护周外长的声明，主张召开包括曾以军队参加对日战争的一切国家的代表的全面的和会。我们中国民主促进会全体会员，誓为缔结真正和平的全面的公正的对日和约而奋斗到底！
