　　Hangzhou’s Worker Consciousness Improved After Democratic Reform Movement
    "Pour Out Grievances, Redress Wrongs, Overthrow the Local Tyrants; Hold Your Heads High, Stand Tall, Do a Good Job in Production!"
    In the democratic reform movement, factories in Hangzhou mobilized the worker masses, and the political consciousness of the masses was generally improved, and they consciously demanded to do a good job in production.
    After suppressing the counter-revolutionary movement, factories in Hangzhou then launched a struggle against feudal bullies, and the broad masses of workers truly felt their political status in the new society. Zhang Qihua, a female worker at Hangjiang Yarn Factory, said in her self-composed liberation song: "Today we are truly liberated, Chairman Mao's kindness is remembered in our hearts," "The spinning frame hums loudly, the sisters beside the frame are full of joy, overthrowing the bullies is true liberation, and we are happily busy with production." Workers at the First Yarn Factory said in a small tune accusing "the Meng family's half of the sky": "Pour out grievances, redress wrongs, overthrow the bullies; hold your heads high, stand tall, do a good job in production!" Workers at Huafeng Paper Mill said: "Our workers are united and powerful, and finally we have overthrown these bullies!" Many staff members also said: "Relying on big names is no longer effective, we can only rely on the Communist Party, strive for progress, and do a good job in production." Some representatives of private factory owners were also very happy. For example, Qi Zuquan, the manager of Chang'an Yarn Factory, said: "I didn't know there were these bad people in the factory before, and many tasks assigned to the engineering department were always impossible to complete. Now that the bad elements have been overthrown, work will be easier to handle in the future."
    In the past, there were many factions and disputes in various factories, but now everyone demands unity and mutual assistance. For example, in the past, the foremen and field workers of the Waterworks were not united, and the field workers had disagreements between the southern and northern factions, all of which were provoked by special agents and bullies. After the accusation meeting exposed the conspiracies of the special agents and bullies, everyone united. Workers demanded progress, demonstrating the improvement of worker consciousness. Seventeen young people from Hangjiang Yarn Factory requested to join the Communist Youth League after the accusation meeting. Female worker Lu Xiaofeng said: "After attending the accusation meeting, I feel that I am progressing every hour, every moment. In the past, I couldn't listen to the words of the Communist Party, but now every word is pleasing to the ear." Some workers used to require the team leader to invite them to meetings, but now they can attend meetings automatically; in the past, they rarely spoke at meetings, but now they speak freely at meetings. For example, Shou Awu, a worker at the First Yarn Factory, said: "In the past, I was afraid of the living阎王 (Yánwáng, King of Hell), and I didn't dare to speak at group meetings, but today I want to tell the truth." Han Fengzhen, a 43-year-old female worker, grabbed people and asked them to tell her something about politics. Due to the improvement of political consciousness, workers consciously demanded to do a good job in production. Now the production efficiency of various factories has generally improved. For example, workers at Hangjiang Yarn Factory reflected: "After driving out the bullies, we will no longer do sloppy work in production." The factory's production efficiency in May increased from 94.5% in April to 96.4%, and the average spindle draft of 21-count yarn in May reached 0.911 pounds, exceeding the factory's historical highest record of 0.881 pounds during the plum rain season by 3.4%. Workers at Zhejiang Iron Factory also said: "The overthrow of the bad element Qian Datian has liberated the repair shop. From now on, we must do a good job in production." The factory's attendance rate in May increased from 96.5% in March to 98.2%, and the total production volume of the seventh group of the machine fitter workshop in May increased by 3.5% compared to April. It used to take five hours to turn a 1-3/8 inch ground shaft, but now it only takes three hours, increasing efficiency by 40%; workers also voluntarily proposed to eliminate defective products. Before the suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement, the Waterworks dug less than four meters of ditch per worker per day, installed 5.45 meters of pipe per worker, and backfilled less than ten meters per worker. After suppressing counter-revolutionaries and launching the struggle against bullies, the average ditch digging was more than seven meters per worker, the average pipe installation was 14.56 meters per worker, and the average backfilling was 22.6 meters per worker, increasing work efficiency by more than one time. After the struggle against bullies at Huafeng Paper Mill, the workers' production enthusiasm was also very high. The 24-hour output of Manure paper at the factory's first plant increased from 30 tons to 34 tons, an increase of 13.3%. In the past, the second plant had many defective cigarette papers, but now there are basically none. The 24-hour output of cigarette paper at the third plant increased from 1,100 rolls to 1,350 rolls, an increase of 22.7%, and the factory saved more than one billion yuan in May.

　　杭州开展民主改革运动后工人觉悟提高
    “吐苦水，伸冤气，斗倒恶霸；抬起头，挺起胸，搞好生产！”
    杭州市各工厂在民主改革运动中发动了工人群众，群众政治觉悟普遍提高，自觉地要求搞好生产。
    杭州市各工厂经过镇压反革命运动以后，接着又对封建恶霸开展了斗争，广大工人群众才真正感到自己在新社会的政治地位了。杭江纱厂女工张琦华在自己编的翻身歌里说：“今朝我们真解放，毛主席恩情记心上”，“细纱车，轰轰响，车边姊妹喜洋洋，斗倒恶霸真解放，欢天喜地生产忙”。第一纱厂工人在控诉“孟家半爿天”的小调中说：“吐苦水，伸冤气，斗倒恶霸；抬起头，挺起胸，搞好生产！”华丰造纸厂工人说：“我们工人团结有力量，到底把这些恶霸打下去了！”很多职员也说：“再靠牌头吃不开了，只有靠着共产党，努力求进步，把生产做好。”有些私营工厂的资方代理人也很高兴。如长安纱厂的经理祁祖铨说：“以前不晓得厂里有这些坏人，不少工作交到工务方面总是办不通。现在斗倒了坏分子，今后工作好办了。”
    过去各厂帮派多，是非多，现在大家要求团结互助。如自来水厂过去管工和场工不团结，场工中南派北派闹意见，都是特务、恶霸挑拨的，控诉大会把特务、恶霸的阴谋揭发后，大家团结起来了。工人们要求进步，表现了工人觉悟的提高。杭江纱厂在控诉会后有十七个青年要求参加青年团。女工陆小凤说：“开过控诉会，才觉着自己是一个钟头赶一个钟头的在进步，从前共产党的话听不进，现在句句中听。”有些工人过去开会要组长请，现在开会能自动到；过去开会发言很少，现在开会有说有讲。如第一纱厂工人寿阿五说：“过去怕活阎王，开小组会不敢说话，我今朝要讲真心话了。”四十三岁的女工韩凤珍拉住人就要求讲点政治给她听听。由于政治觉悟提高，工人都自觉地要求搞好生产。现在各厂的生产效率已普遍提高。如杭江纱厂的工人反映：“赶出恶霸后，我们生产可不再拆烂污了。”该厂五月份的生产效率已从四月份的百分之九十四点五提高到百分之九十六点四，二十一支纱五月份平均锭扯已达到零点九一一磅，超过该厂历史上黄梅季节最高纪录零点八八一磅的百分之三点四。浙江铁工厂的工人也说：“打倒了坏分子钱达天，就解放了修车场。今后我们一定要好好搞生产。”该厂五月份的出勤率已从三月份的百分之九十六点五提高到百分之九十八点二，机钳工场第七小组五月份总生产量比四月份提高百分之三点五。车一又八分之三英寸地轴，过去车一支要五小时，现在只要三小时，效率提高了百分之四十；工人并自动提出要消灭废品。自来水厂在镇压反革命运动以前，每天挖沟每工不到四公尺，安管每工五点四五公尺，回土每工不到十公尺。在镇压反革命和展开反恶霸斗争以后，挖沟每工平均七公尺多，安管每工平均十四点五六公尺，回土每工平均二十二点六公尺，工作效率提高一倍多。华丰造纸厂在斗争了恶霸以后，工人的生产情绪也很高。该厂一厂马粪纸二十四小时的产量从三十吨提高到三十四吨，增加百分之十三点三。该厂二厂过去卷烟纸的废品很多，现在基本上没有了。三厂卷烟纸二十四小时的产量从一千一百卷提高到一千三百五十卷，增加百分之二十二点七，该厂五月份节约了十亿多元。
