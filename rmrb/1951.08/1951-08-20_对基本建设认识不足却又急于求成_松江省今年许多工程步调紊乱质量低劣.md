Lacking understanding of basic construction yet eager to achieve quick results
Many projects in Songjiang Province this year are disorganized and of poor quality
The basic construction work in Songjiang Province, Northeast China, in 1951, has resulted in serious problems such as disorganized pace and poor project quality due to the leadership's insufficient understanding of basic construction work and eagerness for quick success.

Poor Planning and Inadequate Design Lead to Negative Consequences
Among the units that have already started construction, there are serious problems such as crude planning and design errors. For example, in the projects of the Forestry Industry Bureau, 70% of the work has been completed, but the plan is still being changed; the technical design is not up to standard, there is no expansion force in the heating system, and there are no small indoor equipment, which are being added temporarily. The boiler room of Northeast Agricultural College started construction with only a partial sketch; the foundation trench for the auditorium project was dug in September of last year, but the construction drawings completed are still less than one-fifth, which is the most prominent example of starting construction while still planning; even the project is completed, but the plan drawing has not yet arrived, and the plan is often changed. Some units transported materials according to the original plan, but the design was changed, so the materials did not meet the specifications, resulting in waste. The Biological Museum and Chemical Museum projects are 80% complete, but the staircase drawings are not yet available. The walls, cellars, and windows on the two wings of the facade, and other projects that have been started, are all changing back and forth. In the first project of the Machinery Factory, the wall was built, and then it was discovered that there were no stairs, so it had to be torn down and rebuilt. When the Electrical Engineering Factory No. 4 was building a factory in Suihua, the materials and auxiliary equipment were ready, but it was discovered that there were earthquake cracks in the foundation that were not suitable for building a factory, so it was moved to another place to build the factory. The material configuration map in the factory changed three times, and the materials were transported three times. The Rubber Factory did not construct according to the design, and even inserted the gable of the kitchen window into the chimney. 22% of the 127 dormitories have been completed, and when inspected, it was found that rework was generally required, otherwise, unavoidable fires would occur.

Poor Raw Material Allocation and Significant Waste
The allocation of raw materials is not timely, and some of the quality is poor. Firewood from Jiamusi has to be transported to Jilin, while wood from Jilin is also being transferred to Jiamusi. 10% of the raw wood allocated to the Northeast Second Textile Factory is rotten material, and 30% is bent and unusable. The loss of wood after processing at the Electrical Engineering Factory No. 6 is 45%. The raw wood allocated from the Northeast First Textile Factory was damaged when it was unloaded from the train and was not allocated according to specifications and quality. The Electrical Engineering Factory No. 4 used good materials for ash box panels and inferior materials for doors and windows. 35% of the bricks purchased by the Northeast Second Textile Factory cannot be used for factory building construction, and the bricks are of uneven size. The bricks from the brick kiln jointly operated by the Mudanjiang Rubber Factory and private individuals are all "off-grade bricks" and cannot be used for building factory buildings.

The use and storage of materials do not conform to the principles of economic accounting. There is wood everywhere on the construction site of the Forestry Industry Bureau project; wood of one to two feet is used for burning; heating panels are placed in the courtyard; no one cares about the broken cement bags, and there is cement everywhere. The cement pile of the Rubber Factory is outside and piled very high, compacting the cement. The sugar factory club should have built a wall two and a half bricks thick, but it was built four bricks thick; a 1:3:6 concrete should have been used, but a 1:2:4 concrete was used; the steel bars used were too thick, wasting raw materials.

Insufficient Preparation, Hasty Start
The main reason for the above situation is the lack of understanding of basic construction work and the failure to attach importance to and do a good job in preparation. The basic construction in Songjiang Province this year generally started later. Ideologically, they think: "This year is better than last year." "It's impossible not to have problems." Under the guidance of this kind of thinking, some units did not seriously treat the plan, and the plans made did not meet the requirements and were reworked repeatedly. For example, the plan of the Northeast Second Textile Factory was reworked twice, and the original plan was to start construction in mid-May, but it was postponed to mid-July. However, construction projects are seasonal and must be rushed to repair and remedy in the third quarter, so they had to start construction in a hurry, resulting in chaos in the project. There are also some units that, after the plan is approved, the materials are not yet ready, and the allocation is not timely, which affects the project. Such as state-owned grain warehouses in various places. Secondly, there is parochialism. They only care about completing their own tasks, regardless of government decrees. The Northeast People's Government had already promulgated a decree on March 29 this year, but it did not attract the attention of various construction units. Many units have not been able to seriously implement it or have not implemented it at all. In particular, state-owned and public-owned enterprise companies and cooperatives are particularly serious. For example, the construction workers' cooperative undertakes a certain project. Since construction began on June 1, it has been employing an average of about 250 workers every day (more than 280 were counted on July 2). Only 30% of them are members of the cooperative, and 70% are non-members; and these workers have not been allocated by the government, and they are all privately recruited by the two cooperatives in Nangang District and Xinyang District. In the competition to recruit workers, they also raise wages to achieve their goals, so that some workers have a daily wage of 50,000 yuan, which is more than one and a half times the local government's prescribed wage quota. This not only completely failed to implement government decrees, but also seriously affected the mobility of workers, directly causing losses to the project.

### 对基本建设认识不足却又急于求成    松江省今年许多工程步调紊乱质量低劣

　　对基本建设认识不足却又急于求成
    松江省今年许多工程步调紊乱质量低劣
    东北松江省一九五一年的基本建设工作，由于领导上对基本建设工作认识不足，而又急于求成，以致造成步调紊乱、工程质量低劣等严重现象。
    计划粗糙设计不周造成恶果
    在已开工的单位里，表现了计划粗糙和设计错误等严重现象。如森林工业局的工程，已进行了百分之七十，但计划还在变更；技术设计不合规格，暖气没有涨力，室内小设备没有，临时现添。东北农学院锅炉房仅有部分草图就动工；大礼堂工程在去年九月份即挖好底槽，到现在施工图作出的还不够五分之一，这是一面开工一面计划的最突出的例子；甚至工程已完了，而计划图还未到手，并且时常变更计划。有的单位按原订计划运来了材料，但设计变更了，以致材料不合乎规格，造成浪费。生物馆和化学馆工程已完成了百分之八十，但楼梯图还没有。正面两翼的墙、地窖、窗户等已初步动工的工程，都跟着变来变去。机械工厂第一所工程把墙砌起后，才发现没有楼梯，不得不拆掉再修楼梯。电工四厂在绥化建厂，材料及附属设备已经准备好了，打地基时发现有地震裂痕不适于建厂，于是又迁到别处建厂，场内材料配置图变了三次，材料运搬三次。橡胶厂不按设计施工，甚至将厨房窗户马头插在烟囱内，一百二十七栋宿舍已完成百分之二十二，检查时发现了，普遍返了工，否则将会造成不可避免的火灾。
    原材料调拨不灵，浪费很大
    原材料调拨不及时，有的质量不好。佳木斯的木柴、要往吉林运，而吉林的木材也调往佳木斯。东北第二纺织厂调拨的原木，有百分之十是腐朽材料，弯曲不能用的有百分之三十。电工六厂木材加工后损失百分之四十五。东北第一纺织厂拨来的原木卸火车时就坏了，不按规格质量拨。电工四厂把好材料作了灰盒板，次等材料作了门窗。东北第二纺织厂买的砖有百分之三十五不能用于厂房修建，砖的大小不齐。牡丹江市橡胶厂与私人合营的砖窑，尽是“等外砖”，不能用于修建厂房。
    对材料的使用和保管，不合经济核算制的原则。森林工业局工程现场的木头到处都是；用一尺到二尺的木头烧火；暖气片放在院里；洋灰袋子破了没有人管，到处都是洋灰。橡胶厂的洋灰垛在外边，并且堆的很高，把洋灰压实了。糖厂俱乐部应修两砖半厚的墙，而修成四砖厚；应用一比三比六的混凝土，结果用一比二比四的混凝土；用的铁筋太粗，浪费了原材料。
    准备不足，仓促开工
    所以发生上述情况，主要原因是对基本建设工作认识不足，没有重视与做好准备工作。松江省今年的基本建设普遍地开工晚了一些。思想上认为：“今年比去年好了。”“不可能没有毛病。”在这样的思想指导下，有些单位没严肃地对待计划，做的计划不合乎要求，一再返工。如东北第二纺织厂的计划就返了两次工，原预定五月中旬开工，延至七月中旬才开工。但建筑工程是有季节性的，必须要在第三季抢修补救，只好仓促开工，造成工程进行中紊乱现象。还有一些单位等计划批下后，材料还未准备好，调拨又不及时，致影响工程。如各地国营的粮食仓库等。其次是本位主义思想。他们是只顾完成自己的任务，不管政府法令。东北人民政府在今年三月二十九日早已颁布了法令，但并未引起各个施工单位的重视。有很多单位现在还没有能认真执行或根本没有执行。特别是国营公营企业公司及合作社等单位尤为严重。如建筑工人合作社承做某工程，从六月一日开始动工到现在，平均每天占用工人二百五十名左右（七月二日统计二百八十多人）其中社员仅占百分之三十，非社员却占百分之七十；而这些工人全未经政府调配，都是通过南岗区、新阳区两合作社私自招工的。在彼此争招工人中，又以互相抬高工资来达到目的，致有的工人每日有五万元的工资，超过当地政府规定的工资定额一倍半。这不仅完全没有执行政府法令，而且也严重地影响了工人的流动，直接造成对工程的损失。
