　　Purge American Imperialist Secret Agents
    Mao Yisheng
    The judgment by the Military Tribunal of the Beijing Military Control Commission on the case of the American government's secret agent spies plotting armed rebellion is a correct measure that fully meets the demands of the Chinese people.

    This case proves the consistent conspiracy of American imperialism to invade and undermine our country, and its vicious means of being an enemy of the Chinese people. The cracking of this case once again proves that the public security organs of the People's Government are indeed doing as the broad masses of the people require, making all secret agent spies have nowhere to hide and no way to move on the invisible front, and being subjected to the solemn sanctions of the law under conclusive evidence; this group of international spies has committed many evils on Chinese soil, and today, in the capital of New China, they bow their heads and confess their crimes. During the period of resisting America, aiding Korea, and suppressing the counter-revolution, the judgment of this case is of great significance.

    American imperialism advertises itself as "civilized" and "friendly" to China, but the ironclad evidence proves that it is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people. It uses all despicable and insidious means to harm our people's democratic country and plot to murder the leaders of our People's Government. This greatly increases the Chinese people's anger and hatred towards American imperialism.

    We have already completely recognized the essence and true face of American imperialism. We must be extra vigilant against the activities of American secret agent spies and strengthen our opposition to American aggression. In this resolute struggle, the great Chinese people will surely have the strength to achieve a complete victory!

　　肃清美帝国主义特务分子

    北京市军事管制委员会军法处对于美国政府特务间谍阴谋武装暴动案的判决，是完全符合中国人民要求的正确措施。
    这一案件，证明了美帝国主义一贯的力图侵略与破坏我国的阴谋，和与中国人民为敌的毒辣手段。这一案件的破获，又一次证明了人民政府公安机关，确是作到如广大人民所要求的在无形战线上使一切特务间谍分子无处藏身，无法活动，而在罪证昭彰之下，受到法律的严正制裁；这一群国际间谍，曾在中国土地上，作恶多端，今天，在新中国的首都，低头供认所犯罪行。当兹抗美援朝及镇压反革命运动期间，这个案件的判决意义实为重大。
    美帝国主义自己宣传为“文明”，并对中国“友好”，然而铁的证据恰恰证明它是中国人民的死敌。它卑鄙无耻地用一切险毒手段，从事危害我人民民主国家，并且策划谋害我人民政府的首长。这就更大大地增加了中国人民对美帝国主义的愤怒与仇恨。
    美帝国主义的本质及其真面目，我们早已完全认识清楚了，我们要格外提高对美国特务间谍活动的警惕，并加强反对美国侵略。在这一坚决斗争中，伟大的中国人民，一定有力量取得彻底的胜利！
