An Example of Integrating Cotton Procurement and Storage with Other Central Tasks
    ——The Integration of Cotton Procurement and Storage with Production and Flood Prevention in Xinmin Township, Rudong County, Northern Jiangsu

Xinmin Township, in the Judong District of Rudong County (a newly established county, east of Rugao) in the cotton-producing area of northern Jiangsu, has seen its cotton farmers sell and store the vast majority of their stored cotton to the state, thanks to the integration of cotton procurement and storage with production and flood prevention. The cotton selling and storage work in Xinmin Township did not go smoothly at the beginning. At that time, in addition to selling and storing cotton, the township's farmers were rushing to repair the large sluice gate to guard against the major floods in July. At the same time, "weeding in June to catch the sun," production could not be relaxed. With the three major tasks squeezed together, the township and village cadres and Communist Party branch members felt it was difficult to handle, and only made some general appeals for cotton selling and storage in some mass meetings. Xue Fengzhang, the secretary of the Xinmin Township Communist Party Branch, once reviewed, saying: "At that time, the masses were busy with production, and it was not easy to hold meetings, so I had to stand on the bank of the field and wave and shout: 'Sell cotton if you have cotton!' But in my heart, I thought, if they don't sell it today, the cotton farmers will sell it sooner or later." On June 17, the Judong District Communist Party Committee held an enlarged meeting, calling on Communist Party members in various townships to treat cotton procurement and storage as an urgent task and combine it with production and flood prevention work. After the meeting, the Xinmin Township Communist Party Branch immediately coordinated with the township government to convene a joint meeting of village cadres, Communist Youth League members, cotton farmer representatives, and women representatives to carefully study the methods of integrating the three major tasks, and assigned cadres separately. In the following days, the township cadres held villagers' meetings in the evening, or the main village cadres and propagandists went to various village schools and literacy classes to carry out patriotic cotton selling propaganda. All Party and League members and cotton farmer representatives also mobilized two or three cotton storage households each, or two or three people jointly mobilized one cotton storage household to sell cotton. Then, the township cadres widely launched patriotic cotton selling and storage propaganda. When the laborers repairing the gate rested under the shade, the Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members enlightened everyone to recall the pain of the Japanese devils and reactionaries destroying water conservancy in the past, causing floods throughout the township and eating bran and grass, as well as the good times of the bumper cotton harvest in 1950 under the leadership of the People's Government in repairing gates and opening rivers. In this way, the political consciousness of the laborers was raised. Many laborers who repaired the sluice returned to the village after completing their work and became active activists in selling and storing cotton. More than 170 land tilling teams and more than 20 production mutual aid teams in the township, under the mobilization of Party and League members, also became propaganda and mobilization teams for patriotic cotton selling. For example, the land tilling team composed of Lu Yimin, Zhou Xiaoxing, and Wang Chengzhu in Xiaonan Village organized everyone to chat while helping the military family member Shen Zhixin with weeding, so that everyone realized that land tilling was for the front, and selling cotton was also to ensure the clothing of the military and civilians and support the front. As a result, in addition to selling all the stored cotton, the three also mobilized the military family member Shen Zhixin to sell all the stored cotton to the state. The members of the Ni Peilan women's mutual aid group in Henan Village, while resting from weeding, talked about three catties of lint for one foot of cloth before liberation, and one catty of lint for three feet of cloth now; before liberation, only men wore some factory cloth, and now women also wear factory cloth. After such a chat, everyone realized that women should actively mobilize cotton farmers to sell patriotic cotton. Among the twelve members of the group, seven or eight had stored cotton at home. After their mobilization, they all sold it to the state. In addition, literacy classes and primary schools in various villages also participated in the cotton selling propaganda work. Students of Dingbei Village Primary School, using half a day of vacation time, mobilized their parents to sell 300 catties of stored cotton.
    After the cotton selling work in Xinmin Township was launched, in order to solve the contradiction between sending flowers and production time, in addition to each household with more stored cotton going to sell it themselves, people with less stored cotton were organized to entrust others to sell it on their behalf. As of July 10, more than 400 cotton storage households in the township had sold and stored most of the stored cotton (a total of more than 20,000 catties of lint) to the state. The originally scheduled sluice repair project was also approaching completion at the same time. The cotton fields have been generally weeded twice. One-third of the more than 1,020 mu of cultivated land of 176 military families in the township has been weeded three times.

　　购棉储棉和其他中心工作结合的范例
    ——苏北如东县新民乡购棉储棉工作和生产防汛结合
    苏北产棉区如东县（新设县，在如皋以东）掘东区新民乡，由于把购棉储棉工作和生产、防汛工作结合进行，全乡棉农已把绝大部分存棉售储给国家。新民乡的售棉储棉工作，开始时并不顺利。当时，除了售棉储棉外，该乡农民正在赶修大水闸，提防七月大汛，同时，“六月里锄草赶日头”，生产也不能松劲。三大工作挤在一起，乡、村干部和中共支部委员都感到不好办，只是在一些群众会议中作些售棉储棉的一般号召。该乡中共支部书记薛凤章曾检讨说：“当时群众忙生产，开会不好开，只好站在田岸上招招手喊：‘有棉花卖棉花去呵！’但自己心里却想，今天不卖，棉农早晚都要卖的。”六月十七日，掘东区中共区委召开了扩大会，号召各乡共产党员把购棉、储棉工作当做紧急任务，和生产、防汛工作相结合进行。会后，中共新民乡支部立即协同乡政府召开了乡村干部、青年团员、棉农代表、妇女代表的联席会议，认真研究了三大工作结合进行的办法，同时分别配备了干部。以后几天，该乡干部们就在晚间召开村民大会，或由乡村主要干部和宣传员到各村民校、识字班去进行爱国售棉宣传。全体党、团员和棉农代表也每人动员两、三家存棉户，或由二、三人共同动员一家存棉户售棉。接着，该乡干部又广泛展开爱国售棉、储棉宣传。修闸的民工们在凉棚下休息时，中共党员和青年团员就启发大家回忆过去日本鬼子与反动派破坏水利，使全乡遭水灾，吃麸皮、草头的痛苦以及近年来人民政府领导修闸开河，使一九五零年棉花丰收的好光景。这样，提高了民工们的政治觉悟。许多修水闸民工完工回村后，都成了售棉储棉的积极分子。全乡一百七十多个代耕组和二十多个生产互助组，在党、团员的发动下，也成了爱国售棉的宣传动员小组。如校南村由陆益民、周效兴、王成祖三人组成的代耕组，在帮助军属沈志新锄草时组织大家漫谈，使大家认识代耕是为了前方，售棉也是为的保证军民衣着，支援前方。结果，三人除出售全部存棉外，还动员军属沈志新把全部存棉卖给了国家。和南村倪培兰妇女互助组组员们，在伴工锄草休息时，谈到了解放前三斤皮棉一尺布，现在一斤皮棉三尺布；解放前只有男人穿点厂布，现在妇女也穿起厂布了。经过这样漫谈，大家认识到妇女应当积极动员棉农卖爱国棉。全组十二个组员中，有七、八个人的家里有存棉。经她们动员后，都全部卖给了国家。此外，各村识字班和小学校也都参加了售棉宣传工作，丁北村小学校学生，利用半天休假时间，就动员家长们卖出了存棉三百斤。
    新民乡售棉工作开展后，为了解决送花和生产时间的矛盾，除存棉较多的各家自己去卖以外，存棉少的人家就有组织地托人代卖。到七月十日为止，全乡四百多家存棉户已把绝大部分存棉（共二万多斤皮棉）售、储给国家。原定修闸工程也同时接近完成。棉田已普遍锄草两遍。全乡一百七十六户军属的一千零二十多亩耕地，三分之一已锄草三遍。
