Following the Struggle Against Feudal Remnants and the Democratic Solidarity Movement
	Wuhan Yuhua Yarn Factory Workers United to Improve Production
	Overcoming Capitalists' Concerns and Attracting Them to Actively Participate in Democratic Reform
	The democratic reform movement in Wuhan's privately-owned Yuhua Yarn Factory, after undergoing the two stages of democratic struggle and democratic solidarity, entered the democratic construction stage in early August and is currently drafting a plan for adjusting personnel and organizational structure throughout the factory.
	Yuhua Yarn Factory has a history of thirty years. The old management system of the factory relied on feudal headmen to rule the workers. After liberation, this feudal control system still existed, and the suffering of the workers from oppression and exploitation was not alleviated, so it was difficult to give full play to their enthusiasm for production, and the true equal, democratic, mutually beneficial, and contractual labor-capital relations could not be normalized. On the one hand, the status of the workers did not change, and on the other hand, the capitalists pushed the responsibility for production and wages to the trade union. In early April of this year, the factory launched a campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries; in May, a democratic reform movement against feudalism was launched. Under the correct leadership of the factory's CCP branch and trade union committee, the workers, through accusations, denunciations, and struggles, and through labor-capital consultations, suppressed a group of counter-revolutionaries, overthrew a group of feudal remnants, and abolished the feudal headman system, which significantly improved production morale.
	Gradually Alleviating the Concerns of the Capitalists
	At the beginning of the movement, the capitalists were full of worries, fearing that the workers' struggle against feudal remnants would involve them; they also feared that the democratic reform movement would seriously affect production and reduce operating profits. Therefore, the factory's CCP branch repeatedly discussed with the capitalists to explain the policy of democratic reform to them. The factory's CCP branch invited representatives of the capitalists to participate in every conference to struggle against feudal reactionaries. At these meetings, the workers not only accused the feudal reactionaries of oppressing and exploiting the workers, but also exposed the crimes of the feudal reactionaries in sabotaging machines and disrupting production. For example, the workers in the factory's steel wire workshop revealed at a struggle meeting that Zhou Ming, a Kuomintang secret agent who had been appointed as the factory's gatekeeper before liberation for his meritorious service in suppressing strikes, had conspired to blow up the steel wire workshop, which was known as the factory's lifeline, after liberation. Zhang Jinshan, a feudal remnant in the workshop, had mixed small leather pieces into cotton rolls after liberation to damage the steel wire car. Yu Chengli, a feudal headman who had close ties with secret agents and had no technical skills, deliberately wrapped only 350 pounds of new needle cloth when contracting the steel wire car, when he should have wrapped 400 pounds, causing most of the steel wire car needle cloth, which could have been used for fifteen years, to be damaged beyond repair in less than a year, and the factory almost completely shut down as a result. After the workers overthrew Yu Chengli, they quickly unloaded and re-wrapped all the steel wire car needle cloth, rescuing eighty-four new steel wire needle cloth, so that the losses caused by Yu Chengli's sabotage did not continue. The explanations of the CCP branch and the above facts made the capitalists realize the necessity of the democratic reform movement and began to change their "hands-off" attitude, supporting and supporting the movement in all aspects. In the movement, the capitalists accepted the workers' demands to dismiss certain feudal headmen and gang leaders from the factory, abolish the feudal headman system, and establish a production team leader system, and selected a group of workers supported by the workers to serve as production team leaders.
	In order to further eliminate the concerns of the capitalists and the estrangement between employees and workers, in mid-July, a democratic symposium with representatives from both labor and capital and a democratic solidarity symposium with representatives from workers and employees were held, bringing the movement into the stage of democratic solidarity. At the labor-capital democratic symposium, representatives from both labor and capital talked about their understanding of democratic solidarity, expressing their determination to actively promote democratic solidarity, improve labor-capital relations, and improve production. Huang Bao'e, director of the factory, said: "In the old society, there were many phenomena of disunity between workers in different shifts and workshops, and between workers and employees; our factory was also undemocratic in production management, and the organizational structure was also set up to accommodate individuals. Therefore, it is very necessary to promote democratic solidarity." Wan Yuqi, deputy director of the factory, said: "I used to be high and mighty, rarely contacting workers, and not paying attention to their feedback, thinking I knew it all. I hope to hear many specific opinions in this democratic solidarity stage, so that I can strive to correct them." Worker representatives also spoke enthusiastically, unanimously expressing their desire to put forward opinions and work hard to improve production.
	Moving Towards Unity Through Criticism and Self-Criticism
	After freeing themselves from the heavy shackles, the workers exerted their political and productive enthusiasm. Previously, due to the oppression of feudal reactionaries, the workers' work morale was low, but now they feel, "It's really glorious to be a worker!" In the past, when the capitalists exchanged good cotton for bad cotton when processing for the Huasha Cloth Company, they watched without saying anything, but now they criticize the capitalists for such illegal acts and submit them to the government for handling. In the past, when it came to learning or meetings, they were always late or even hid. Now, when the bell rings, no one is late. The workers also criticized individual members of the factory's CCP branch who had impure components and backward thinking. The branch has accepted the workers' opinions and expelled these people from the party. The workers also suggested to the branch that they should solicit the opinions of the workers when recruiting party members in the future.
	Among the opinions put forward by the workers in the democratic solidarity stage, 80% were related to production, with the most opinions on the production responsibility system. In the past, workers in the steel wire and drawing frame departments of the factory did not care about each other in production and had many opinions at the same time. In the democratic solidarity movement, everyone conducted criticism and self-criticism. Worker Zhong Huanying said: "In the past, when I was working, I didn't care when I saw that other people's machines were in bad condition. I only wanted to do my own work well and produce more. I must correct this in the future. We can only improve production by helping each other." Afterwards, the steel wire and drawing frame departments signed a contact contract. The workers in the roving maintenance department of the factory were divided because they were squeezed and instigated by counter-revolutionaries and feudal remnants, so fourteen people had fourteen minds. After the anti-feudal struggle, their enthusiasm for production increased, and they became united with each other. Chen Changhe, a car washing worker who had always been considered backward, also became active. He said: "In the past, I didn't like to work because the bad guys were on top of us." Xiao Zhonghuan, an old technical worker who never liked to talk, also became active and became a trade union group leader. In the democratic solidarity movement, they also seriously carried out criticism and self-criticism, and truly united ideologically. The flat car team and the car washing team also established mutual aid groups, and when there were difficulties in their work, everyone helped each other to solve them. The workers' opinions to the capitalists were compiled and sent to the capitalists for consideration. Then, a labor-capital consultation meeting was held, combining the inspection of the implementation of the Trade Union Law, the Provisional Regulations on Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, the Labor-Capital Collective Contract, and the Labor-Capital Consultation Meeting Agreement, and gradually solving and answering the demands and questions raised by the workers.
	Production Has Been Rising Throughout the Movement
	In the democratic reform movement, the labor productivity of the workers in the Yuhua Yarn Factory has not declined, but has gradually increased. The 20-hour spindle draft in April was 0.946 pounds, which increased to 0.948 pounds in May and 0.951 pounds in June. The amount of cotton used per yarn has been reduced from 420 kilograms to 412 kilograms. In the past, it took six people in the roving maintenance department's flat car team twelve days to flatten a roving machine, but now it only takes seven days. In the past, it took six people in the car washing team three hours to wash a car, but now it only takes five people two and a half hours. Shen Guiying, a labor model in the factory, after learning Hao Jianxiu's new operation method, found that the average return of flowers from 400 spindles in seven hours was only about 0.8 pounds, while in the past it was 1.65 pounds on average in ten hours. Now the roving workers in the spinning room are actively learning Hao Jianxiu's working method.
	Capitalists Recognize the Necessity of Democratic Reform
	When the factory entered the democratic construction stage after going through the two stages of democratic struggle and democratic solidarity, Wan Yuqi, deputy director of the factory, wrote an article entitled "Industrialists and Businessmen Should Support and Participate in the Democratic Reform Movement," which was published in the Dagang Daily on August 11th, and Huang Bao'e, director of the factory, also wrote an article entitled "My Understanding of the Democratic Reform Movement," which was published in the Yangtze River Daily on August 18th. They both stated that private enterprises must carry out democratic reforms in order to improve their business and develop production. Wan Yuqi's article said: "In order to develop production and increase production, old enterprises must be transformed into new enterprises. To achieve this goal, it is even more necessary to go through the democratic reform movement. Because only through the democratic reform movement can the workers' enthusiasm for production be improved, and there is a foundation for doing a good job in production. Therefore, the democratic reform movement is the common requirement and common need of both labor and capital." Therefore, they both told industrialists and businessmen: "There is no need to doubt, we should provide all efforts and strive to favorably unfold and accelerate the completion of this movement. For the development of our own business, we should not only be satisfied with supporting this movement as bystanders, but also strive to support and actually participate in this movement, and should actively improve the personnel lineup, rectify the organizational structure, enrich production equipment, and rely on the workers to run our factories well." Encouraged by the workers' enthusiasm for labor, the capitalists of the factory are actively improving their operations. In addition to increasing production equipment, they are also starting to build dormitories for workers and gradually improve employee benefits. (Report from our Wuhan reporter station)

　　经过反封建残余的斗争和民主团结运动
    武汉裕华纱厂职工团结生产提高
    打破资方顾虑吸引他们积极参加民主改革
    武汉市私营裕华纱厂的民主改革运动，经过了民主斗争和民主团结两个阶段以后，已于八月上旬进入了民主建设阶段，正在草拟全厂调整人事和组织机构的方案。
    裕华纱厂已有三十年的历史。该厂旧的管理制度是依靠封建头佬统治工人。解放后，这种封建把持制度依然存在，工人群众被压迫和剥削的痛苦仍未解除，因而生产积极性难以发挥，工人与资方的真正平等、民主、两利、契约的劳资关系也不能正常。一方面工人地位没有改变，另方面资方把生产和工资等问题推给工会去负责。今年四月初，该厂开展了镇压反革命运动；五月间，掀起了反封建的民主改革运动。工人们在该厂中共支部和工会委员会的正确领导下，经过控诉、检举和斗争，通过劳资协商，镇压了一批反革命分子，斗倒了一批封建残余分子，废除了封建头佬制度，生产情绪显著提高。
  逐步解除了资方的顾虑
    在运动开始时，资方顾虑重重，害怕工人群众反对封建残余的斗争会牵连到自己；还怕民主改革运动会严重影响生产，降低经营利润。因此，该厂中共支部曾多次和资方商谈，向他们解释民主改革的政策。在每一次斗争封建反动分子的大会上，该厂中共支部都邀请了资方代表参加。在这些会上工人群众不仅控诉封建反动分子压迫、剥削工人的罪恶，而且揭发了封建反动分子破坏机器、破坏生产的罪行。如该厂钢丝车间工人群众在斗争会上曾揭发：解放前因镇压罢工有功而被任命为该厂门卫长的军统特务周明，解放后曾阴谋炸毁号称该厂命根子的钢丝车间。该车间封建残余分子张金山在解放后，曾用小皮块掺入棉卷，来破坏钢丝车。与特务分子往来密切的毫无技术的封建头佬余承立，曾在承包钢丝车时，故意把应缠四百磅的新针布只缠三百五十磅，使该厂绝大部分能用十五年的钢丝车针布上车不到一年即损坏得不堪收拾，该厂因而几乎全部停工。工人们在斗倒余承立后，很快就把所有钢丝车针布卸下重包，抢救了八十四台新钢丝针布，使余承立的破坏所造成的损失没有继续下去。中共支部的解释和上述这些事实使资方认识到民主改革运动的必要性，开始转变了“袖手旁观”的态度，从各方面赞助和支持这一运动。在运动中，资方接受了工人们提出的开除某些封建头佬、帮会头子出厂和废除封建头佬制和建立生产小组长制的要求，并且选拔了一批为工人群众所拥护的工人担任生产小组长。
    为了进一步消除资方的顾虑以及职员和工人的隔阂，七月中旬，召开了劳资双方代表参加的民主座谈会和工人和职员代表参加的民主团结座谈会，使运动进入民主团结阶段。在劳资民主座谈会上，劳资双方代表都谈出了各自对民主团结的认识，表示决心积极搞好民主团结工作，改善劳资关系，改进生产。该厂厂长黄葆锷说：“在旧社会里，班与班、车间与车间的工人之间、工人与职员之间，存在着很多不团结的现象；我们厂方在生产管理上也不民主，组织机构也是因人设事。因此，搞好民主团结，是很必要的。”副厂长万毓琦说：“平时我高高在上，和工人很少接触，不注意工人的反映，自以为是。希望在这次民主团结阶段中，能听到很多具体意见，好力求改正。”工人代表们也踊跃发言，一致表示要好好提出意见，努力搞好生产。
  经过批评与自我批评走向团结
    工人们在解除了自己身上的重重束缚之后，发挥了政治的和生产的积极性。以前，工人们由于受着封建反动分子的压迫，劳动情绪低落，现在感到：“作一个工人真光荣！”从前，当资方给花纱布公司加工用坏棉花换好棉花时，他们看着不讲，现在他们对资方这类违法事实提出批评，并提交政府处理。从前一说要学习或开会，总是迟迟不到，甚至躲藏起来。现在铃声一响，没有一个迟到。对于该厂中共支部新吸收的个别成分不纯、思想落后的党员，工人们也提出批评，支部已接受工人们的意见，开除了这些人的党籍。工人们并向支部建议，以后吸收党员时应征求一下工人们的意见。
    在民主团结阶段，工人们提出的意见中，百分之八十是有关生产方面的，其中以生产责任制方面的意见为最多。该厂钢丝和并条两部工人，过去在生产上互不关心，同时也有许多意见。在民主团结运动中，大家都进行了批评与自我批评，工人钟焕英说：“以前我干活时，看见别人的车子开了花，也不管，只想自己做好，多出些活。我今后一定要改正。大家互相帮助才能搞好生产。”其后，钢丝、并条两部就订立了联系合同。该厂粗纱保全部工人，因为被反革命分子和封建残余分子压榨和挑拨，所以十四个人十四条心。经过反封建斗争，他们生产积极性提高了，相互之间团结了。过去一向被认为是落后的洗车工人陈昌和，也积极起来了。他说：“过去我不喜欢做事，就是因为坏蛋们压在我们的头上。”一向最不喜欢说话的老技术工人萧忠焕也积极了，并且当了工会小组长。他们在民主团结运动中，又认真地展开了批评和自我批评，真正从思想上团结起来了。平车组和洗车组还建立了互助小组，工作上有困难时，大家就互相帮助解决。工人们向资方提出的意见，经过整理后，送给资方考虑。接着，又召开了劳资协商会议，结合检查执行工会法，私营工商业暂行条例，劳资集体合同和劳资协商会协议案等情形，逐步解决和解答工人所提出的要求和问题。
  在运动中生产一直上升
    裕华纱厂的工人们，在民主改革运动中，劳动生产率不但没有低落，而且已逐渐提高。四月份的二十小时锭扯是零点九四六磅，五月份增加到零点九四八磅，六月份又增加到零点九五一磅。每件纱的用棉量已由四百二十斤降到四百一十二斤。该厂粗纱保全部平车组六个人，过去平一台粗纱机要十二天才能平好，现在只要七天就能完成了。洗车组过去六个人洗一台车子要三小时，现在五个人只要两小时半就行了。该厂劳动模范沈桂英，在学习了郝建秀新的操作法后，看四百锭子七小时平均回花量只有零点八磅左右，过去是十小时平均一点六五磅。现在细纱间值车工都正积极学习郝建秀工作法。
  资方认识了民主改革的必要
    当该厂经过民主斗争和民主团结两个阶段，转入民主建设阶段的时候，该厂副厂长万毓琦写了一篇《工商业家应该支持和参加民主改革运动》，在八月十一日《大刚报》上发表，厂长黄葆锷也写了《我对于民主改革运动的认识》一文，在八月十八日的长江日报上发表。他们都说明了：私营企业要改进业务，发展生产，必须进行民主改革。万毓琦副厂长的文章中说：“为了发展生产，增加生产，旧企业必须改造为新企业。要达到这一目的，经过民主改革运动更是必要的。因为只有通过民主改革运动，工人生产积极性才可提高，搞好生产才有基础。所以民主改革运动是劳资双方共同的要求，共同的需要。”因此，他们两人都告诉工商业者：“毫无疑虑的必要，应当提供一切的努力，为有利展开与加速完成这一运动而奋斗。我们为了本身业务的发展，不应该仅仅以旁观者的态度赞助这运动为满足，而且要尽力支持和实际参加这一运动，应主动地健全人事阵容，整顿组织机构，充实生产设备，依靠工人群众办好我们的工厂。”该厂资方在工人们的劳动热情鼓舞下，正积极改善经营。除了增加生产设备以外，并开始给工人建筑宿舍，逐步增进职工福利。（本报武汉记者站）
