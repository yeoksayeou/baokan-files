            Competition or No Competition, That Makes All the Difference!
    In Yushu County, Jilin Province, leading organs seized the opportunity in mid-June, after farmers across the county had completed their first round of hoeing and weeding, to launch a general summer hoeing appraisal campaign among the county's two thousand mutual aid teams and individual farmers. The appraisal covered six aspects: comparing the enthusiasm for patriotic labor, comparing the number of hoeing and weeding rounds, comparing the thoroughness of hoeing and weeding, comparing the achievements in plowing on behalf of the families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, comparing women's participation in summer hoeing, and comparing the amount of additional fertilizer applied. At the same time, it called on farmers across the county to conduct appraisals as they worked. The method of appraising during the evenings after daytime labor and appraising each task as it was completed saved time, was specific and detailed, and was easy to sustain.
    During the appraisal, not only were the differences in farming techniques among the mutual aid teams and individual farming households identified, but also the conservative thinking of many farmers was broken, changing their past belief that "whether there is competition or not, it's all the same work," and motivating them to participate in the high-yield competition. As for the villages and settlements with previously excellent production achievements, they worked even harder in the appraisal and achieved even better results.
    Another advantage of appraising as you go is the ability to revise the high-yield plan at any time according to the progress of production and to add new content in a timely manner.
            The Power Generated from Labor Insurance
    Workers in the coal mining team of the First Coal Mine in Agan Town, Gansu, launched a safe production competition to celebrate the implementation of labor insurance. In April and May, not only were there no accidents, but the coal output also increased by 80% compared to the past. This shows that when workers truly understand the consistency between increasing production for the country and their own interests, and engage in production with the attitude of masters, they can unleash tremendous potential that was not previously demonstrated.

            竞赛不竞赛，就是不一样！
    吉林省榆树县，领导机关在六月中旬趁全县农民完成头遍铲趟的机会，发动全县二千个互助组和一般农民，普遍进行夏锄的评比工作。评比内容有六项，即：比爱国劳动积极性，比铲趟遍数，比铲趟细致，比为烈士家属、革命军人家属代耕的成绩，比妇女参加夏锄，比追肥多少。同时号召全县农民随做随评。采取白天劳动晚上评比、做一样评比一样的办法，使评比既省时间，又很具体细致，并容易坚持下来。
    在评比中，不仅分出了各互助组和各农户农作技术的高低不同，并打破了许多农民的保守思想，改变了他们过去认为“竞赛不竞赛，还不是一样干”的思想，推动他们参加了丰产竞赛。至于原来生产成绩优良的村屯，在评比中更加努力，成绩更好。
    随做随评的另一好处是能根据生产的进度，随时修正丰产计划，及时增加新的内容。
            从劳动保险中产生的力量
    甘肃阿干镇第一煤矿的采煤组职工，为庆祝劳动保险的实行，曾展开安全生产竞赛，四、五月份不但没有发生事故，并且采煤量还比过去提高了百分之八十。这说明了，工人确实明白了为国家增加生产和自己的利益的一致性的时候，以主人翁的姿态从事生产的时候，能够发挥出以前没有表现出来的巨大的潜力。
