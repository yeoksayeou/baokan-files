　　Li Lanting and Her Surgical Team on the Korean Front
　　Liming

　　One morning, this reporter visited Comrade Li Lanting, the captain of the Shanghai Military Medical University volunteer surgical team, who had just returned from Korea. I learned about her and the work of the volunteer surgical team she led on the Korean front.

　　A few days after this volunteer surgical team left Shanghai, they arrived at a city on the Yalu River. There, they saw the flames of war burning across the Yalu River and heard the roar of American aerial bandits dumping tons of steel onto Korean soil. Strong anger burned in the hearts of Li Lanting and her companions. At the same time, looking back at our motherland, with its countless chimneys puffing smoke and people living peacefully, they further realized: "To defend the security of our motherland, we must use our practical actions to drive the American invaders out of Korea!" They crossed the Yalu River, rushed to the front, and took on the task of rescuing the wounded and healing the sick.

　　They visited the Hungarian volunteer medical team and the Korean People's Army hospital. They were deeply moved by the lofty internationalist spirit of the comrades of the Hungarian volunteer medical team from a distant fraternal country. The Korean comrades working intensely in a Korean People's Army hospital further inspired their patriotic zeal to dedicate everything to the motherland. And among the soldiers and wounded of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army they contacted, they constantly received profound education. They once vowed: "For the motherland, for world peace, we will spare no sacrifice and loyally dedicate everything we have!"

　　During the tense days of battle, they worked day and night. Li Lanting worked alongside everyone, inspecting the wounds of the injured, arranging surgeries, organizing X-ray examinations, setting up operating rooms and pharmacies, organizing stretchers, and sometimes personally administering anesthesia and performing complex surgeries on the seriously wounded. Under Li Lanting's scientific division of labor and strict organizational leadership, the volunteer surgical team achieved extremely high efficiency, enabling the wounded to recover quickly and return to the front lines. In just under eight months, they performed more than 1,200 various complex surgeries without a single accident.

　　All the comrades of the volunteer surgical team worked with selfless spirit.

　　Attending surgeon Zhang Zhong insisted on working as usual despite suffering from severe diarrhea. Dr. Wang Haoran suffered from stomach problems, but he still took charge of the medical care of more than a hundred wounded and frequently participated in surgeries. Nurse Dai Suyu became a caring nanny to the wounded in the ward. Before dawn, she would run to the ward, and she would not return to rest until all the patients were quietly asleep. In addition to doing all the nursing work, she would cut the patients' nails, wipe them down, and read newspapers to them whenever she had time. The wounded said, "Nurse Dai takes care of us better than our own sisters."

　　In days when the cold wind howled and the snow flew in sub-zero temperatures of thirty degrees below zero, the doctors, nurses, and staff of the volunteer surgical team often persisted at their posts until late at night, and then got up again to work before dawn.

　　On the Korean front, Li Lanting and her volunteer surgical team, like every Chinese and Korean soldier and every Korean citizen, were engaged in a heroic and arduous struggle against the vicious enemy.

　　Li Lanting quickly learned how to deal with enemy air raids and ground artillery blockades in various situations. Once, when they were traveling by car to a certain place on the front, they had to pass through a 30-mile blockade zone controlled by enemy naval warships. She repeatedly mobilized everyone, telling them about the weaknesses of enemy nighttime shooting and how to deal with them. When the car entered the enemy warships' blockade circle, it encountered enemy warships firing. Li Lanting and all the comrades calmly guided the driver. Although the enemy warships' searchlights frantically searched and shells exploded one after another around the car, their car, under the command of Comrade Li Lanting, successfully rushed out of this 30-mile-long dangerous zone.

　　On the Korean front, in order to prevent the loss of medicines, Li Lanting personally led everyone to dig air-raid shelters in the frozen ground wherever they went, hiding the medicines and equipment inside. Surgeries that could not be performed during the day were rescheduled to be performed at night. Sometimes, even when enemy planes were circling above them, they still worked calmly.

　　The severe destruction and devastation of Korea by the American aggressor bandits made the work of the surgical team much more difficult. At the front, they had only one operating room set up on the ground. The rest of the people had to work in damp underground bunkers. There were no tables, chairs, or formal sterilization equipment. Sometimes, even bandages were lacking due to transportation difficulties. But all this could not stop their work. They came up with various ways to overcome the difficulties: they made anesthesia masks out of lead wire; they made tables, chairs, and oxygen frames out of wooden boards, and cut down large trees in the mountains to make saline solution stands; they made siphon hand washers out of iron plates and lead wire; they tore up their own quilts, disinfected them, and used them instead of bandages; when performing surgeries, the covers of the gas lamps were almost burned to ashes, but they still tried to use them for two or three more days, sometimes even using gas lamps, candles, or combining everyone's flashlights to replace the gas lamps. When personnel were insufficient, one person took on the work of four people: anesthesia, listening to the heart, taking the pulse, and watching the clock. In order to reduce the pain caused to the wounded by anesthesia, they created a method of intravenous anesthesia. In order to avoid enlarging the wound when finding shrapnel during surgery, they first used X-rays to locate the shrapnel before cutting. During tense days, they often performed four or five major surgeries or seven or eight minor surgeries in one night. In order to ensure that the wounded received timely treatment, some comrades stood by the roadside on cold days with heavy snow, examining the wounded coming down from the front and keeping the seriously wounded for treatment. In order to reduce the suffering of the wounded from bumps, they leveled the uneven road by themselves.

　　The lives of the volunteer surgical team and the people fighting on the Korean front were very difficult. They often lived in damp air-raid shelters, filling their stomachs with frozen potatoes and dry fried noodles. But they were very happy and worked with great enthusiasm. In their spare time, they also conducted professional and current affairs studies in the air-raid shelters and held various cultural and recreational evenings.

　　What power enabled them to do this? Li Lanting said: "When we encounter hardships and difficulties, we think of our great people's leader Chairman Mao and our beloved compatriots, and of the people all over the world who support us. Then we feel that our hardships and difficulties are glorious, and we have the strength, and we are filled with confidence in victory."

　　李蓝丁和她的手术队在朝鲜前线
    黎明
    一个上午，记者访问了刚从朝鲜归来的上海军医大学志愿手术队队长李蓝丁同志。了解了她和她所领导的志愿手术队在朝鲜前线工作的情形。
    他们这一个志愿手术队离开上海几天以后，到达了鸭绿江边的一个城市，在那里看见鸭绿江对岸燃烧着的战火，听到美国空中强盗把成吨的钢铁倾掷在朝鲜土地上所发出的巨响，李蓝丁和她的同伴们，每个人的心中都烧起了强烈的怒火。同时，回头看看我们的祖国无数的烟囱在突突的冒烟，人民和平地生活着。他们因此而更进一步地认清了：“要保卫我们祖国的安全，只有用我们的实际行动，把美国侵略者赶出朝鲜去！”他们跨过了鸭绿江，奔向前方，担当起救死扶伤的任务。
    他们曾经参观了匈牙利志愿医疗队和朝鲜人民军的医院。他们深深地为来自遥远的兄弟国家的匈牙利志愿医疗队同志们崇高的国际主义精神所感动。在朝鲜人民军某医院里紧张工作的朝鲜同志们，更激发了他们的把自己的一切献给祖国的爱国主义的热忱。而在他们所接触的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的战士和伤员中间，他们不断地受着深刻的教育。他们曾经发誓：“为了祖国，为了世界和平，我们不惜任何牺牲，忠诚地献出我们的一切！”
    在紧张的战斗的日子里，他们日日夜夜地工作着，李蓝丁和大家一起忙碌着，她们检查伤员的伤口，要布置手术的进行，要组织Ｘ光的检验，布置手术室、药房，组织担架，有时还要亲自给重伤员进行麻醉和施行复杂手术。在李蓝丁的科学的分工和严密的组织领导下，志愿手术队发挥了极高的效能，使伤员们迅速恢复健康，重回前线。在仅仅不足八个月的时间里，他们进行了各种复杂手术一千二百多次，并且没有发生过一次事故。
    志愿手术队的全体同志，都以忘我的精神从事工作。
    外科主治医师张忠大夫在患着严重的腹泻的情形下，仍坚持照常工作。王浩然大夫患着胃病，但是他依旧负责一百多伤员的医疗工作，而且还经常地参加做手术。护士戴素玉在病房里成了伤员亲切的褓姆，天不亮她就跑到病房里，晚上要在病员都安静地入睡以后，她才回去休息。每天她除了做好一切护理工作外，有了时间便给伤员剪指甲、擦洗、读报。伤员们说：“戴护士照顾我们比亲姐妹还要好。”
    在寒风呼啸、大雪纷飞的零下三十度的日子里，志愿手术队的大夫、护士、工作人员，经常在每个人的工作岗位上坚持到深夜，而天不亮就又起来工作了。
    在朝鲜前线，李蓝丁与她的志愿手术队，和每一个在朝鲜前线的中、朝人民战士，每一个朝鲜人民一样，与穷凶极恶的敌人进行着英勇而艰苦的搏斗。
    李蓝丁迅速地学会了在各种情况下对付敌人的空中袭击和地面上炮火封锁的方法。有一次，当他们乘汽车往前线某地的时候，要经过敌人海上兵舰三十里地的封锁地带，她反复地向大家动员，告诉大家敌人夜间射击的弱点和怎样对付它们的办法。当汽车进入到敌舰的封锁圈时，遭遇到敌舰的射击，李蓝丁和所有的同志沉着地指引着驾驶员，虽然敌舰的探照灯疯狂地搜索，炮弹一发紧接着一发在汽车周围爆炸。他们的车子在李蓝丁同志的指挥下，胜利地冲出了这三十里长的危险地带。
    在朝鲜前线，为了不使药品受到损失，每到一地，李蓝丁便亲自率领大家一齐动手，在冰冻的土地上挖防空洞，把药品器材藏在里面。白天不能施行手术，就改到晚上进行。有时敌机在他们上空盘旋，他们仍然镇静地工作。
    美国侵略强盗对朝鲜的严重的摧残和破坏，使手术队的工作增加了许多困难。在前线，他们只有一个手术房设在地面上，其余的人都要在潮湿的地洞内工作，没有桌子、椅子，没有各种正规的消毒设备，有时连绷带也因运输困难而缺乏，但是这一切都不能阻止他们的工作。他们想出了各种方法来克服困难：他们用铅丝做成麻醉口罩；用木板钉成桌子、椅子和氧气架子，自己到大山上锯下大树制成盐水架子；用铁板、铅丝等做成虹吸洗手器；撕破自己的被单，消毒以后代替绷带；进行手术时，没有罩子的煤气灯泡已快烧成灰烬了，但是还要争取用上三两天，有时甚至用瓦斯灯、洋蜡，或者把大家的手电筒集合起来代替煤气灯。人员不够分配，一个人担任麻醉、听心脏、按脉搏、看表四个人的工作。为了减轻伤员因麻醉而增加的痛苦，便创造了用静脉麻醉的办法。为了避免开刀时找不到弹片而扩大伤口，便先经Ｘ光透视，找出弹片的所在，然后再开刀。在紧张的日子里，他们往往一夜要进行四、五个重伤手术或七、八个轻伤手术。为了使伤员能得到及时的治疗，有的同志在大雪纷飞的寒冷日子里，站在公路边，检查着从前线下来的伤员，把重伤员留下进行治疗。为了使伤员少受颠簸的痛苦，他们自己动手把高低不平的大道铺平。
    志愿手术队和在朝鲜前线战斗着的人们一样，生活是很艰苦的。他们常常居住在阴湿的防空洞里，用冻硬的马铃薯和干炒面充饥。但是他们却非常愉快，工作热情很高。他们空暇的时候并且在防空洞里进行业务学习和时事学习，举行各种文娱晚会。
    什么力量能使他们如此呢？李蓝丁说：“当我们在遇到艰苦和困难时，我们就想到了我们伟大的人民领袖毛主席和亲爱的祖国同胞，想到支持我们的全世界人民，于是我们就感到我们的艰苦和困难是光荣的，我们也就有了力量，我们就充满着胜利的信心。”
