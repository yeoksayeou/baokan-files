　　Chahar Province and City Organs Inspect Party History Study
    The Propaganda Department of the CCP Chahar Provincial Committee
    Editor's note: The purpose of studying Party history is to enable every party member and the masses to understand the experience of the Chinese working class and its political party in leading the broad masses of peasants and other democratic forces in the struggle for New Democracy; to study the experience of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong in fighting against various opportunist ideas and the enemies of the people in various complex historical environments; to become familiar with the laws of social development in China; and to further strengthen the understanding of the Chinese Communist Party and communism, and enhance confidence in the cause of the Chinese revolution and construction. Some cadres in the organs of Chahar Province and City do not have a deep understanding of this point. Therefore, instead of helping to solve some fundamental questions raised by party members and cadres in their studies, they consider them as "splitting hairs" and "jokes," and suppress the questions. This approach is a manifestation of a lack of ideological leadership. Party organizations in various localities should pay attention to this when leading the study of Party history.
    In early August, the Party Committee of the Chahar Provincial People's Government and the Zhangjiakou Municipal Party Committee inspected the Party history study and existing problems in more than 20 subordinate units. Most units conducted Party history study in a planned manner according to the instructions of the CCP Chahar Provincial Committee. Currently, most units have completed "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party," some are conducting question-and-answer sessions and tests, and some have begun studying "Mao Zedong Thought is the Integration of Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese Revolution" and other "July 1st" commemorative essays. This Party history study has not only involved a large number of participants, but has also yielded greater gains than the study of Chinese history. Many comrades have clarified many issues. This is because most party members and non-party cadres are eager to become familiar with the glorious, great, and correct history of the Party, and to understand specifically how Chairman Mao combined Marxist-Leninist theory with the actual conditions of the Chinese revolution in various revolutionary periods, developed Marxism-Leninism, and led the Chinese revolution to great victory. Veteran cadres also deeply realized that only by systematically studying Party history can they improve their theoretical level, correctly grasp policies, and do their work well. Therefore, they carefully read documents and earnestly discussed them. The leading cadres of some units regarded leading the study of Party history as an important task, personally making mobilization reports, conducting inspections, and organizing cadres with higher levels to participate in the study to answer difficult questions. This is a good aspect of this Party history study.
    On the other hand, from this Party history study, we can see that many leading organs lack experience in ideological leadership, and many very important ideological problems have not been resolved. Most party members and non-party cadres feel that self-study is difficult. Some people say: "When I open the book, I seem to understand everything; when I close the book, everything is vague." Therefore, there is a general demand for leading comrades to give systematic reports, but most units have not done a good job of organizing forces to meet the learning requirements of cadres and to solve various ideological problems raised by party members and the masses in a planned way. During the study, some people mentioned that the reason for the failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War was because Sun Yat-sen died. Others asked, "Who exactly led the Great Revolution?" Some people think that "Left" is better than "Right," "Left" is just revolution gone too far, and "Right" is capitulationism. Some people asked, "Why is it one of the advantages and characteristics of the Chinese revolution that revolutionary armed forces oppose counter-revolutionary armed forces?" Some leading cadres did not solve these problems, but instead criticized them as "splitting hairs" and "making jokes," and rejected these important ideological problems. Of course, selecting a group of instructors who can guide the study and answer questions is not an easy task. But the problem does not lie here. The main thing is that the leadership (first of all, the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee) did not sufficiently estimate this study and did not make enough preparations. Taking the study instructors as an example, there were more than 1,700 cadres participating in the study in 25 large units of the provincial government, but only four units had study instructors. The general branch of the Industry Department sent a cadre with a very low level of education to study at the Party history teacher training class.
    Secondly, there is another serious shortcoming in this Party history study, that is, some units only focused on studying the First and Second Revolutionary Civil War periods, studied the Anti-Japanese War period perfunctorily, and neglected the Third Revolutionary Civil War period and the construction period of the People's Republic; they also did not focus on studying the basic experience of the past thirty years. This kind of study actually cuts off the entire revolutionary history of the Party. In this way, it is impossible to understand the Party's entire experience in struggle, and it is impossible to understand Chairman Mao's major contributions to the Party and the people in various historical periods. It is necessary to focus on studying the Second Revolutionary Civil War period, but there are still some major historical issues that the Central Committee has already made conclusions on, but we still have confused ideas and need to clarify them in this study. It would be wrong to think that "we have participated in the struggles of the last three historical periods and generally know about them," so there is no need to study them carefully. Units that have studied in this way should also pay attention to studying the Party's last three historical periods when studying "Mao Zedong Thought is the Integration of Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese Revolution," and finally make one or two supplementary reports to gain a systematic understanding of Party history.
    In the study in August, we should pay attention to solving the above-mentioned ideological problems. Criticize wrong understandings and clarify confused ideas. Some individual units have studied Party history better because they have done a better job in study guidance and paid attention to solving ideological problems. In the study, we must connect with our own thoughts. Is there a range for connecting with thoughts? Yes, it should mainly be placed on criticizing and clarifying various confused and wrong understandings of the Chinese revolutionary struggle experience and Mao Zedong Thought, in order to guide everyone to correctly understand the basic ideas and viewpoints contained in the book.
    The method of "answering questions" is a better way of self-study. It can exercise self-study ability, independently understand the basic ideas in the book, and consolidate what has been learned. But the role of "answering questions" should not be exaggerated, and the role of other learning methods should not be ignored. Holding prepared discussions, giving reports, and answering questions in a centralized manner are all good learning methods.

### 察哈尔省市机关检查党史学习

　　察哈尔省市机关检查党史学习
    中共察哈尔省委宣传部
    编者按：学习党史的目的，在于使每个党员及群众了解中国工人阶级及其政党领导广大农民和其他民主力量，为新民主主义而奋斗的经验；研究党和毛泽东同志在各种复杂的历史环境中同各种机会主义思想进行斗争，同人民敌人进行斗争的经验；熟习中国社会发展的规律；进一步加强对中国共产党和共产主义的认识，增强对中国革命事业和建设事业的信心。对于这一点，察哈尔省、市机关少数干部是认识得不深刻的，因此对于党员、干部在学习中提出的一些带根本性质的问题，不但不予帮助解决，反而认为是“钻牛角尖”“说笑话”，把问题压制下去了。这种作法就是缺乏思想领导的表现。各地党组织在领导党史学习时，应引起注意。
    八月初，中共察哈尔省人民政府党委会、张家口市委宣传部，检查了所属二十多单位党史学习情况和存在的问题。各单位对党史学习大部是按照中共察哈尔省委指示有计划地进行的。现在，大部分单位已学完《中国共产党的三十年》，有的正在进行答题、测验；有的已开始学习《毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义与中国革命的结合》和其它“七一”纪念论文。这次党史学习，不仅参加的人数多，而且收获也比中国历史的学习要大，许多同志明确了很多问题。这因为多数党员和非党干部，都迫切要求熟悉党的光荣、伟大、正确的历史，要求具体了解毛主席在各个革命时期，怎样把马克思列宁主义理论和中国革命实际结合起来，发展了马克思列宁主义，领导中国革命取得了伟大的胜利。老干部并深刻地认识到只有系统地学习党史，才能提高自己的理论水平，正确掌握政策，作好工作。因此，他们精心阅读文件，认真讨论。有些单位的领导干部，把领导学习党史当做一件重要工作，亲自作动员报告，进行检查，组织水平较高的干部参加学习，解答疑难问题。这是此次党史学习好的一方面。
    另一方面，从这次党史学习中，我们可以看到许多领导机关是缺乏思想领导的经验的，许多很重要的思想问题没有得到解决。大多数党员和非党干部，感到自学吃力。有些人说：“搬开书本，好像啥也懂；合上书本，啥也模模糊糊。”所以，普遍要求领导同志作有系统的报告，可是大部分单位并没有很好地组织力量，去满足干部的学习要求，有计划地来解决党员、群众在学习中所提出的各种思想问题。学习中有人提到第一次国内革命战争失败的原因是因为孙中山死掉了。又有人提出“大革命”究竟是谁领导的？有人认为：“左”倾比“右”倾好一些，“左”倾只是革命过了火，“右”倾是投降主义。有人提出“为什么革命的武装反对反革命的武装，是中国革命的优点和特点之一呢？”对于这些问题某些领导干部不去解决，反而批评这是“钻牛角尖”、“说笑话”，把这些重要的思想问题打回去了。当然，挑选一批能够指导学习、解答问题的指导员并不是一件容易的事情。但问题还不在这里，主要的是领导上（首先是省委宣传部）对这次学习估计不够，准备不足。就以学习指导员说，省府二十五个大单位，有一千七百多个干部参加学习，只有四个单位有学习指导员。工业厅总支派了一个文化程度很低的干部去党史教员训练班学习。
    其次，这次党史学习中，还有一个严重的缺点，就是有些单位只着重学了第一、第二次国内革命战争时期，潦草地学了抗日战争时期，忽略了第三次国内革命战争时期和人民共和国的建设时期；对于三十年基本经验，也没有着重学习。这种学法，实际上是把党的整个革命历史割裂开来。这就不可能了解党的全部斗争经验，不可能了解毛主席在各个历史时期对党和人民的重大贡献。着重学第二次国内革命战争时期是必要的，但还有若干重大历史问题中央虽已作了结论，但我们仍有糊涂观念，需要在这次学习中弄清楚的。如果认为“我们参加过后三个历史时期的斗争，一般是知道的”，就不必再仔细的去学习，那是错误的。这样学过的单位，在学习《毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义与中国革命的结合》的时候，还要注意学习党的后三个历史时期，最后补作一、两次报告，以求对党史有系统的了解。
    在八月份的学习中就要注意解决上述的一些思想问题。批判错误的认识，澄清糊涂观念。个别单位对党史学的较好，就因为在学习指导方面做得较好，注意解决思想问题。在学习中要联系自己思想。联系思想有没有范围？有的，主要应该放在批判和澄清对中国革命斗争经验和毛泽东思想的各种糊涂的错误的认识上，以引导大家正确理解书中所包含的基本思想和观点。
    “作答题”的办法是一种较好的自学方式。可以锻炼自学能力，独立理解书中的基本思想，巩固所学到的东西。但不应该夸大“作答题”的作用，忽视了其他学习方法的作用。有准备的开讨论会、作报告、集中解答问题等，都是很好的学习方法。
