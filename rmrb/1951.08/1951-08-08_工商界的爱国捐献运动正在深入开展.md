The patriotic donation movement is deepening in industrial and commercial circles.
　　Currently, the patriotic donation movement in industrial and commercial circles is deepening. In many places, industrialists and businessmen have already started paying their first batch of donations. For example, the industrial and commercial circles in Shenyang City have completed the first batch of donations for ten fighter planes, paying 15.2 billion yuan; the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin City paid more than 11 billion yuan. In Suzhou City, the industrial and commercial circles collectively paid the first installment of 3 billion yuan in late July. In small cities, the industrial and commercial circles in Yuci, Shanxi Province, have paid more than 625 million yuan, and the industrial and commercial circles in Suining County, northern Sichuan, paid 222.5 million yuan for the June donation for the "Suining" fighter plane. Many industrial and commercial households or industries are implementing their donation plans in a step-by-step manner. For example, the first and second joint venture groups of 28 private financial firms in Shanghai have paid more than 1 billion yuan according to plan; the gunny sack industry in Nanjing paid the first installment of more than 10 million yuan at the end of July, according to the method of donating in installments every six months.

　　In order to ensure the practical completion of the donation plans proposed by industrial and commercial circles, the federations of industry and commerce in many cities have deeply led various industries and industrial and commercial households in formulating specific patriotic donation plans. For example, the donation plans initially formulated by industrialists and businessmen in Shenyang City were mostly general clauses such as "increasing production," "accelerating capital turnover," and "improving management"; some industries did not undergo sufficient deliberation, and the proposed donation targets were unrealistic. The Shenyang Federation of Industry and Commerce convened the chairmen of various industries to form a donation committee of industrial and commercial circles, conducted investigations and studies on 64 industries, and helped industries that had not formulated donation plans to propose donation targets and revise inappropriate ones. For example, the brokers' association initially proposed a plan to donate 12 million yuan in six months without fully deliberating with all members. After the specific assistance of the production increase and donation committee, publicity and education were carried out among the members, and after deliberation, it was raised to 120 million yuan. The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association first selected three types of pharmaceutical factories, namely Xinyi, Kefa, and Meiyou, representing large, medium, and small sizes, and studied that the ratio of increased production profit to turnover of the three factories was about 3%, so it initially proposed that the pharmaceutical industry contribute 3% of the turnover each month as a donation figure. Then it was passed by the executive and supervisory committee and brought to the member groups for discussion. After deliberation and mobilization in various groups, a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members and group leaders was held to formally pass it. In this way, the donation target of the pharmaceutical industry was determined - calculated at 45 billion yuan of monthly turnover, one plane can be donated each month. Each member factory then formulates its own specific donation plan based on this figure.

　　The donation plans of many industrial and commercial industries and industrial and commercial households are closely integrated with business operations, and are formulated based on improving management, increasing production, and increasing income; this makes the donation movement contribute to promoting the development of industry and commerce, and expands the strength for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. For example, the Shanghai Cement Plant, after labor-capital consultation, decided to overproduce 600 tons of cement per month and donate the profits obtained. The cotton textile industry has formulated donation plans to improve quality, reduce costs, reduce the rate of defective cloth, and save cotton, electricity, and office expenses. The cigarette industry participates in the joint purchase of tobacco leaves, and donates the part saved from purchasing raw materials from individual purchases to joint purchases, which amounts to 1.6 billion yuan per month. The cooked water industry plans to jointly purchase and centrally transport fuel, which can save 230 to 40 million yuan per month to donate to purchase airplanes and cannons. Industrialists and businessmen in many places have come up with ways to expand sales in order to increase income. For example, the Hangzhou silk weaving industry decided to open up sales channels to the Soviet Union and new democratic countries in terms of export sales, and at the same time establish a specification system to open up the domestic sales situation. The members of the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association decided to carry out technical mutual assistance in order to generally open up the sales of medicines. Chengde Daxing Iron Factory and nearby local product departments, rural cooperatives, etc. signed contracts to expand the scope of promotion.

　　In addition to donating from increasing production and saving, many industrialists and businessmen also contribute a portion of their existing surplus. For example, Shanghai Xinhua, China Industrial, China General Commerce, Siming, and Jianye five joint state-private banks and general management offices decided to donate nine airplanes within the year. The donation methods they formulated are: (1) Donate three airplanes in one lump sum, taken from the surplus in the first half of the year. (2) Donate three airplanes in installments, taken from the surplus in the second half of the year, and donate equally over six months. (3) Donate three airplanes in installments through increased production, and donate in installments from the net profit of increased production in the second half of the year. The standard for increased production donation is based on the net profit rate of each bank in May, and the increase from July onwards will be used as a donation, and all those exceeding the donation target will also be donated. Now, the unit has donated the first batch of three airplanes.

　　In the donation movement, workers and shop assistants in many factories and stores have helped the capitalists to come up with ways to improve management and save expenses, and have taken practical actions to ensure the realization of the patriotic donation plan. For example, after hearing the call of the Federation of Industry and Commerce to increase production and save donations, the members of the Hangzhou long-distance bus industry were not confident at first, believing that the previous savings had reached a "saturation point," and now it is the summer off-season, and there is no way to increase income. However, after consultation with the employees, each company decided to organize vehicles and car bodies in batches during the off-season to welcome the peak month in business after the autumn harvest, and decided to save 3% in the direct driving cost per kilometer of each car (including tires, fuel, and materials). The value of these savings, together with the donation figures of the capital agents, can be donated by the entire industry for a total of 250 million yuan.

　　In order to consolidate the achievements of the patriotic donation movement, many industrialists and businessmen have incorporated the donation plan into the patriotic pact. In many towns and cities such as Shenyang, Shanghai, Bengbu, and Guanxian County in western Sichuan, the industrial and commercial circles have combined the current inspection and revision of the patriotic pact movement, and gradually formulated donation plans from industry to household, and incorporated it into the patriotic pact. In this way, the donation plan is fixed in the form of clauses in the patriotic pact, and the patriotic pact is enriched with specific content.

### 工商界的爱国捐献运动正在深入开展

　　工商界的爱国捐献运动正在深入开展
    目前，工商界的爱国捐献运动正在深入开展。许多地方的工商业者已开始缴纳第一批捐款。如沈阳市工商界已经完成第一批十架战斗机的捐献计划，缴纳了一百五十二亿元；天津市工商界缴纳了一百一十多亿元。苏州市工商界在七月下旬集体缴纳了第一期捐款三十亿元。在小城市，山西榆次工商界已缴纳六亿二千五百多万元，川北遂宁县工商界缴纳了“遂宁号”战斗机的六月份捐款二亿二千五百万元。许多工商户或行业，都在有步骤地实现着捐献计划。如上海市私营金融业第一、第二联营集团二十八家行庄已按计划缴纳捐款十亿余元；南京市麻袋业按照半年捐献分批缴纳的办法，在七月底缴纳了第一期捐款一千多万元。
    为使工商界已提出的捐献计划能切实完成，许多城市的工商联合会组织已深入领导各行业及工商户拟订具体的爱国捐献计划。如沈阳市工商业者最初订立的捐献计划，多是笼统的“增加生产”、“加速资金周转”、“改善经营”等条文；有些行业没有经过充分酝酿，提出的捐献目标不切实际。沈阳市工商联合会召集各行业理事长组成工商界捐献委员会，对六十四个行业进行了调查研究，帮助没有订出捐献计划的行业提出捐献目标，不合适的进行修改。如经纪人同业公会第一次未经全体会员充分酝酿，就提出半年捐献一千二百万元的计划。经过增产捐献委员会具体帮助，在会员中进行宣传教育，酝酿成熟之后，提高到一亿两千万元。上海市制药工业同业公会首先选择了信谊、科发、美优等大、中、小三种类型的制药工厂，研究了三个厂半年增产所得利润与营业额的比例都是百分之三左右，因而初步提出制药业每月提出营业额百分之三作为捐献数字。然后在执监委员会上通过，又带到会员小组中讨论。经过各小组酝酿动员后，又召开执监委员和小组长联席会议正式通过。这样就确定了制药业的捐献目标——以每月四百五十亿营业额计算，每月即可捐献一架飞机。各会员厂家再根据这数字拟订本单位具体的捐献计划。
    许多工商行业和工商户的捐献计划是与经营业务密切结合，从改善经营、增加生产、增加收入出发订立的；这就使捐献运动有助于促进工商业的发展，为抗美援朝扩大了力量。如上海水泥厂经过劳资协商，决定每月超额生产六百吨水泥，捐献所得利润。棉纺业订出了提高品质、降低成本、减少次布率、节约用棉、用电及事务费用的捐献计划。卷烟业全业参加烟叶联购，把由单独购买到联购原料所节省的部分捐献，每月即有十六亿元。熟水业计划联购和集中运输燃料，每月可以省出二亿三四千万元捐献出来购买飞机大炮。许多地方工商业者想出了推广销路的办法，以增加收入。如杭州丝织业决定在外销上开辟苏联及新民主主义国家的销路，同时建立规格制度，打开内销局面。上海市制药业公会各会员厂决定进行技术互助，以求普遍打开药品销路。承德市大兴铁厂和附近各土产部门、农村合作社等订立了合同，以扩大推销范围。
    许多工商业者除了从增产、节约出发进行捐献以外，还从已有盈余中提出一部分来捐献。如上海新华、中国实业、中国通商、四明、建业五家公私合营银行及总管理处，决定在年内捐献飞机九架。他们制订的捐献办法是：（一）一次捐献飞机三架，从上半年度盈余中提出。（二）分期捐献飞机三架，从下半年度盈余中提出，分六个月平均捐献。（三）分期增产捐献飞机三架，以下半年度增产纯益额分期捐献。增产捐献标准以各行处五月份纯益率为计算基数，自七月份起以其增加额作为捐献，超出捐献目标者亦全部捐献。现在，该单位已经捐献了第一批三架飞机。
    在捐献运动中，许多厂店的工人、店员，帮助资方想出了改善经营、节约开支的办法，并以实际行动来保证爱国捐献计划的实现。如杭州长途汽车业各会员在初听到工商联的增产节约捐献的号召后，信心不高，认为过去的节约已达“饱和点”，现在又正值夏季淡月，增加收入也没有办法。但各公司经过与职工协商的结果，决定乘淡月内分批整理车辆车身，以迎接秋收后业务上的旺月，并决定在每辆汽车每公里直接行车成本（包括轮胎、燃料、材料）内节约百分之三。这些节约的价值，连同资方代理人捐献数字在内，全业共可捐献二亿五千万元。
    为了巩固爱国捐献运动的成果，许多工商业者已把捐献计划订入爱国公约。沈阳、上海、蚌埠、川西灌县等许多城镇工商界结合了当前正在推行的检查、修订爱国公约运动，逐步拟订由行业到户的捐献计划，并把它订入爱国公约。这样就把捐献计划用条文形式在爱国公约上固定下来，又使爱国公约有了具体内容而充实起来。
