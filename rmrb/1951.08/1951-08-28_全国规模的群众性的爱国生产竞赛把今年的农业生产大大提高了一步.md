　　The nationwide mass patriotic production competition has greatly improved this year's agricultural production.
    The patriotic production competition movement in the vast rural areas of the country continues to flourish. This nationwide mass production competition movement has greatly improved this year's agricultural production.

  Over 4,000 Mutual Aid Teams Have Accepted the Challenge from Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team
    Up to now, 4,184 mutual aid teams and 2,700 model workers in thirty provinces and regions across the country have accepted the challenge from the Li Shunda mutual aid team. At the same time, various regions are using the method of "chain competition" to carry out production competitions between villages, teams, and households within their respective areas. This has made the scale of this year's production competition movement unprecedentedly large. The regional competition movements in the old liberated areas of Northeast and North China have developed most extensively and deeply. In Heilongjiang Province, more than 33,000 mutual aid teams have participated in the summer hoeing competition. In Daming County, Hebei Province alone, more than 14,500 mutual aid teams and 180,000 individual farmers have joined the regional production competition movement. In addition, the wheat-producing areas also launched seasonal production competitions such as summer harvesting and summer selection. This competition was initiated by 47 mutual aid teams in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, and was enthusiastically responded to by 8,458 mutual aid teams in various wheat-producing areas. This movement promoted the early completion of summer harvesting and summer selection work in various places.
    After the spring plowing and spring planting, many regions conducted mass inspections and summaries of the production competition movement. Immediately following, on the basis of the spring production competition, the summer production competition movement was further launched. Recently, the Li Shunda mutual aid team launched the autumn production competition movement to the whole country, so that the movement can be sustained and continuously improved.

  Combining Farmers' Patriotic Enthusiasm with Their Desire to Become Prosperous
    This year's patriotic production competition movement was launched on the basis of conducting patriotic ideological education among the broad masses of peasants, combining the peasants' patriotic enthusiasm with their desire to become prosperous. The state's unified plan and requirements for agricultural production have now become the basis and goal for the mutual aid teams, model workers, and individual farmers participating in the production competition to formulate specific production increase plans. This year, the national plan for planting industrial raw material crops and the plan for planting commercial grain crops in some areas have not only been successfully completed, but many areas have exceeded the original plan. This year, the planting area of crops such as wheat, cotton, jute, and tobacco in Northeast China has exceeded the plan. Although Hebei Province was under severe spring drought this year, the cotton planting area also exceeded the original plan. After the arrival of summer, farmers in various places carried out competitions to ensure the growth of various crops and ensure a bumper harvest. Farmers participating in the competition played an active leading role in the struggle to eliminate pests, prevent drought and waterlogging, making these struggles achieve great victories.

  Improving Agricultural Technology in the Competition
    In the competition, farmers in various places generally demanded to improve and improve agricultural technology. The mutual teaching and mutual learning of agricultural technology has become a mass movement in various places. Many farmers also set up their own "small farms" and "high-yield fields" to specialize in the study of farming techniques. Many rural areas have established or strengthened technical research associations. Therefore, in this year's spring plowing and spring planting, farmers have generally carried out deep plowing and careful cultivation, increased fertilizer application, selected improved varieties, and disinfected seeds. The demand for improved varieties, chemical fertilizers, and new agricultural implements has been felt to be in short supply in various places. This year, the number of cultivations in the national autumn fields and the area of topdressing have also increased compared with previous years. Taking the Northeast as an example, the number of hoeing passes in the autumn fields in the region has increased by one pass compared with last year, and the depth has increased by half an inch to one inch. According to preliminary statistics from fifteen counties in North Manchuria, where there has never been a habit of applying topdressing, more than 700,000 mu of autumn fields were topdressed this year. Farmers participating in the competition in various parts of South Manchuria applied fertilizer twice to the autumn fields.

  The Competition Makes the Mutual Aid Teams More Solid and Developed
    The competition movement consolidated and further developed the mutual aid organizations. The phenomenon of disintegration of many mutual aid teams in the old areas has disappeared. This year, the number of year-round mutual aid teams in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, increased by 78% compared with last year. The number of year-round mutual aid teams in Guancheng County, Pingyuan Province, has increased from 679 to 881. According to the statistics of four districts in Qinglong County, Rehe Province: there were only 1,103 mutual aid teams before spring plowing, and it developed to 2,353 teams during summer hoeing; the labor force participating in the mutual aid teams increased from more than 5,600 people before spring plowing to more than 11,000 people. The mutual aid organizations in new areas such as Shaanxi and Henan have developed greatly. According to the statistics of Jia County, Henan Province alone, the mutual aid teams have developed to more than 4,000.
    Now that the busy season of autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn plowing is approaching, many regional leading organs and the broad masses of farmers are nervously inspecting and evaluating the patriotic production competition movement in the first half of the year, summarizing the good experiences and good methods in the past competition movement, and preparing to better carry out the autumn production competition movement.

### 全国规模的群众性的爱国生产竞赛把今年的农业生产大大提高了一步

　　全国规模的群众性的爱国生产竞赛把今年的农业生产大大提高了一步
    全国广大农村中的爱国生产竞赛运动继续蓬勃地开展着，这一全国规模的群众性的生产竞赛运动，大大提高了今年的农业生产。
  已有四千多个互助组向李顺达互助组应战
    到目前为止，全国已有三十个省区的四千一百八十四个互助组和二千七百个劳动模范向李顺达互助组应战。同时，各地区又用“连环竞赛”的方法，在本地区进行着村与村、组与组、户与户的生产竞赛。这就使今年的生产竞赛运动的规模空前巨大。东北和华北老解放区的地区性的竞赛运动，发展得最为广泛和深入。黑龙江省参加夏锄竞赛的互助组，已达三万三千多个；河北省仅大名一个县就有一万四千五百多个互助组，和十八万单干农民，投入了地区性的生产竞赛运动。此外，各产麦区还开展了夏收夏选等季节性的生产竞赛。这一竞赛是由陕西省兴平县的四十七个互助组发起的，曾得到各产麦区八千四百五十八个互助组的热烈响应。这一运动推动各地的夏收夏选工作提前完成。
    许多地区在春耕、春种结束后，曾对生产竞赛运动进行了群众性的检查和总结。紧接着又在春季生产竞赛的基础上，进一步开展了夏季生产竞赛运动。最近李顺达互助组又向全国发起秋季生产竞赛运动，这样就使运动得以持久不懈，步步提高。
  把农民群众爱国热忱和发家要求结合起来
    今年的爱国生产竞赛运动，是在向广大农民进行了爱国主义思想教育的基础上开展起来的，它将农民的爱国热忱和发家要求结合起来。国家对农业生产的统一计划和要求，现在已成为参加生产竞赛的互助组、劳动模范和单干农民制订具体增产计划的依据和奋斗目标。今年全国种植工业原料作物，和部分地区种植商品粮食作物的计划不仅已顺利完成，且有不少地区超过了原订的计划。东北今年小麦、棉花、洋麻、烟草等作物的种植面积，都超过了计划。河北省今年虽在严重的春旱之下，植棉面积也超过原来的计划。夏季到来后，各地农民又为保证各种作物成长，保证丰收而进行竞赛。参加竞赛的农民，在除治害虫、防旱防涝的斗争中，起了积极的带头作用，使这些斗争取得了伟大的胜利。
  在竞赛中改进农业技术
    竞赛中，各地农民普遍要求提高和改进农业技术。农业技术的互教互学已成为各地的群众性的运动。许多农民还自设“小农场”、“丰产地”，来专门研究农作技术。不少农村建立或加强了技术研究会。因而，在今年的春耕、春种中，农民进行深耕细作、增施肥料、选种优良品种和种籽消毒已经相当普遍。各地的优良品种、化学肥料和新式农具已感供不应求。今年全国秋田中耕遍数和施追肥面积也比往年增加。以东北为例，该区秋田铲趟的遍数，少的比去年增加了一遍，多的增加了四遍，而且比去年深半寸到一寸。向来没有施追肥习惯的北满，据十五个县的初步统计，今年有七十多万亩秋田上了追肥。南满各地凡参加竞赛的农民，都为秋田追了两次肥。
  竞赛使互助组更加巩固发展
    竞赛运动巩固并进一步发展了互助组织。老区许多互助组的涣散现象已经没有了。山西省武乡县今年的常年互助组，比去年增加了百分之七十八。平原省观城县的常年互助组，已由六百七十九个增加到八百八十一个。据热河省青龙县四个区的统计：春耕前仅有一千一百零三个互助组，夏锄时就发展到两千三百五十三组；参加互助组的劳动力，由春耕前的五千六百余人增至一万一千余人。陕西、河南等新区互助组织有很大发展，仅据河南郏县的统计，互助组已发展到四千多个。
    现在，秋收、秋种、秋耕的农忙季节快要到了，很多地区领导机关和广大农民，都在紧张地检查和评比前半年的爱国生产竞赛运动，总结过去竞赛运动中的好经验和好办法，准备更好地开展秋季生产竞赛运动。
