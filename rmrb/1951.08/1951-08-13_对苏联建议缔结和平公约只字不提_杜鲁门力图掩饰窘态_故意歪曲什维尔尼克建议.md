Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 11th TASS: U.S. President Truman said at a press conference that he was particularly interested in the section of Shvernik's letter stating that the Soviet government does not in any way hinder the contact between the Soviet people and the people of other countries.

Truman made no mention of the Soviet proposal to conclude a peace pact among the five major powers; nor did he mention the facts cited in the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR regarding the discriminatory measures taken by the United States against the Soviet Union. He said that the Soviet reply had been published in the United States. However, everyone knows that, in stark contrast to the Soviet press's full publication of the correspondence and resolutions between the two countries, the vast majority of American newspapers only published tendentious summaries of the Soviet reply, and completely failed to mention the specific facts listed in the Soviet document exposing the discriminatory policies of the U.S. government.

Truman said that he did not believe there was sufficient reason to expect the Soviet reply to ease tensions.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 10th TASS: The exchange of letters between U.S. President Truman and N.M. Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, has attracted great attention in the United States.

It should be pointed out that U.S. State Department officials have attacked Soviet newspapers for not publishing the U.S. Congress's resolution on relations between the American and Soviet peoples and Truman's letter. However, in the United States, only less than one percent of the people knew the contents of these two documents before Shvernik's reply was published.

Apparently not considering the Congressional resolution to be of any serious significance, no American newspaper ever published the full text of the resolution. The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune only published summaries of the resolution in inconspicuous locations; other New York newspapers and newspapers in other major cities did not mention it at all.

Later, the White House released Truman's letter to Shvernik, dated July 7, and the American newspapers gave it the same treatment. Only The Washington Post published the full text. The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune only published simple summaries. The New York World-Telegram and The Sun, the New York Post, and The Baltimore Sun did not publish a single word.

State newspapers paid even less attention to these documents.

Now, the full text of Shvernik's reply has not only been published in The New York Times, but also in Washington newspapers. The Washington Star, The Washington Daily News, and The Washington Post are clearly following the instructions of the State Department, namely: American newspapers should make a propaganda show of being "willing" to publish Soviet opinions.

　　对苏联建议缔结和平公约只字不提
    杜鲁门力图掩饰窘态
    故意歪曲什维尔尼克建议
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十一日讯：美国总统杜鲁门在记者招待会上说：他对于什维尔尼克信中所说苏联政府并不以任何方式阻碍苏联人民与其他国家人民的交往一节，特别感到兴趣。
    杜鲁门对于苏联要求缔结五大国和平公约的建议，只字不提；他也没有提到苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议中所举出的关于美国对苏联所采取的歧视措施的事实。他说：苏联的复文已在美国公布。但是大家都知道，与苏联报刊全文刊载两国间来往函件和决议的情况截然不同，绝大多数的美国报纸只是别有用心地披露了苏联复函的摘要，而对于苏联文件中所列举的、揭露美国政府歧视政策的具体事实却完全没有提到。
    杜鲁门说：他认为没有充分的根据来期望苏联的复函会消除局势的紧张状态。
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社纽约十日讯：美国总统杜鲁门与苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克交换信件一事，在美国已经引起极大的注意。
    应当指出，美国国务院官员曾攻击苏联报纸没有发表美国国会关于美苏两国人民间的关系的决议与杜鲁门的信件。但是，在美国国内，大约只有不到百分之一的人民，在什维尔尼克的答复发表以前知道这两个文件的内容。
    显然是由于并不认为国会决议有何严重意义，所以没有一家美国报纸曾经刊登该决议的全文。《纽约时报》与《纽约先驱论坛报》仅在不显著的地位刊载了这个决议的摘要；其他纽约报纸与其他大城市的报纸甚至只字未提。
    后来白宫发表了杜鲁门七月七日致什维尔尼克的信件，美国报纸也给予了同样的待遇。只有《华盛顿邮报》刊登了全文。《纽约时报》与《纽约先驱论坛报》只刊载了简单的摘要。《纽约世界电讯太阳报》、《纽约邮报》与《巴尔的摩太阳报》等连一个字也没有刊登。
    各州报纸对这些文件更不重视。
    现在，什维尔尼克的答复全文不仅刊登在《纽约时报》上，华盛顿各报也都予以刊载。《华盛顿明星报》、《华盛顿新闻报》与《华盛顿邮报》显然是遵奉国务院的指示，即：美国报纸要作“愿意”发表苏联意见的宣传性的表示。
