Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Military Region, Deng Baoshan, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, and Sun Zuobin, Deputy Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, were all present to provide guidance.

    In his speech, Secretary Xi Zhongxun pointed out: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, all ethnic groups in the Northwest region have achieved great unity on the basis of national equality. The task for the future is to continue to consolidate and develop this great unity, and strive for the common development and progress of all ethnic groups in political, economic, cultural and other aspects. At present, the large-scale training of ethnic minority cadres is to create the most basic condition – the condition of cadres – for the complete liberation of all ethnic minorities and for the common development and progress of all ethnic groups. This is an urgent task for local Communist Party organizations and people's governments, and it is also a long-term goal of the Northwest Nationalities Institute.
