　　U.S. Official News Agencies and Newspapers Shamelessly Clamor to Create an Atmosphere for the U.S. to Sabotage Negotiations and Continue the War of Aggression
　　[Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd] U.S. official news agencies are creating an atmosphere for the U.S. to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations and continue the war of aggression. The United States Information Service, under the U.S. State Department, said on August 16th in summarizing U.S. comments on the Korean armistice negotiations: "As the stalemate continues, more observers have talked about another approach: If the Communists refuse to compromise, resume the war." The United States Information Service cited many U.S. comments on suspending the Kaesong talks and resuming large-scale war. The San Francisco Chronicle made no secret of the U.S. unwillingness to continue negotiations, let alone reach an agreement. The newspaper said: The United States "continuing the Kaesong discussions may be more harmful than interrupting them." The Washington Star clamored for the Chinese and Korean sides to succumb to the U.S.'s unreasonable demands regarding the military demarcation line and said unscrupulously: "If the enemy (referring to the Chinese and Korean sides) does not make concessions on this point in the Kaesong meeting, the problem may have to be resolved by resuming large-scale warfare, which may soon expand into the kind of war advocated by General MacArthur." U.S. radio commentator Eid even more blatantly stated: "The Kaesong talks have reached a point where our military commanders in Korea are openly talking about resuming full-scale warfare." In fact, Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. invading Korean army, declared on the 14th that the U.S. military "couldn't bear it anymore" and "would like to show their skills." United Press International Vice President Bartholomew, after meeting with Ridgway and Van Fleet on the 11th, also telegraphed from Tokyo: "The conclusion reached after talks with senior United Nations authorities here and in Korea is that unless the Communists suddenly change their minds, the situation may continue to deteriorate, leading to large-scale warfare on the front again." That is to say, unless the Chinese and Korean sides accept the U.S.'s unreasonable demand to draw the military demarcation line north of the 38th parallel within the positions of the Chinese and Korean troops, the U.S. will launch a large-scale war. Bartholomew also revealed the U.S. conspiracy to expand the war. He said: "If the Kaesong talks break down immediately or gradually, the scope of the war may change. Responsible commanders frankly admit that it is impossible to achieve a complete military victory in Korea by using the current United Nations forces on the battlefield to drive out the communists and consolidate Korea. If sufficient additional troops are to be brought in to win the war, then Washington and the capitals of the United Nations countries must change their perceptions of the tactical situation, and they must allow attacks across the Yalu River on what General MacArthur called the Manchurian 'privileged sanctuary'." These signs indicate that what the United States is currently concerned about is not stopping the Korean War, but continuing the war, and is willing to undermine the armistice negotiations and carry out new military adventures. However, people can expect that whether this is blackmail or intimidation, or a determination to launch military adventures, the only result waiting for the U.S. aggressors is more disastrous defeat.

### 美国官方新闻机关和报纸无耻叫嚣  为美方破坏谈判继续侵略战争制造空气

　　美国官方新闻机关和报纸无耻叫嚣
    为美方破坏谈判继续侵略战争制造空气
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国官方新闻机关正为美方破坏朝鲜停战谈判、继续进行侵略战争制造空气。美国国务院所属美国新闻处八月十六日在综述美国关于朝鲜停战谈判的评论时就说：“随着僵局的继续，更多的观察家谈到了另一个办法，即：如果共产党拒绝妥协，就重新开始战争。”美国新闻处援引了美国许多关于中止开城谈判、恢复大规模战争的评论。旧金山纪事报就毫不讳言美方不愿继续谈判，更不用说达成协议。该报说：美国“继续开城讨论可能比中断开城讨论害处还要大”。华盛顿明星报叫嚣要中朝方面屈从美方关于军事分界线的无理要求，并肆无忌惮地说：“如果敌人（按指中朝方面）在开城会议中在这一点上不作让步，问题很可能须要以恢复大规模战争的方法予以解决，这种大规模战争可能很快地扩大为麦克阿瑟将军所主张的那种战争。”美国广播评论员艾德更明目张胆地说：“开城会谈已经到了这样一个境地，以致我们在朝鲜的军事司令官们在公开谈论恢复全面规模战争的问题了。”事实上美国侵朝军战地司令范佛里特于十四日就扬言美军“已经忍耐不住”，“很喜欢好好显显身手”。而合众社副社长巴塞罗缪在与李奇微和范佛里特会谈后于十一日亦自东京发电说：“与此间和朝鲜的联合国高级当局会谈后所得的结论是：除非共产党突然改变主意，否则，局势可能不断恶化，以致在战线上再度发生大规模战争。”这就是说，除非中朝方面接受美方关于把军事分界线划在三八线以北中朝军队阵地内的无理要求，否则美方就要发动大规模战争。巴塞罗缪并透露了美方扩大战争的阴谋。他说：“如果开城谈判立即破裂或逐渐破裂，战争的范围可能有所改变。负责的司令官坦白地承认，用联合国目前在战场上的部队来驱出共军和巩固朝鲜的方法，在朝鲜是不能达成军事的全胜局面的。如果要调来充分的更多的部队以赢得战争胜利，那末华盛顿和联合国各国首都方面对于战术形势的观念就必须有所改变，他们就必须允许跨过鸭绿江对麦克阿瑟将军所称的满洲‘特权庇护所’加以袭击。”这些迹象表明，美国目前所关心的不是停止朝鲜战争，而是继续战争，不惜破坏停战谈判，进行新的军事冒险。然而，人们可以预计，不论这是敲诈恫吓也罢，执意发动军事冒险也罢，等待美国侵略者的结果只有一个，就是更加惨重的失败。
