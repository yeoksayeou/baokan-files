Why Don't the Eulogizers of Wu Xun Investigate Wu Xun's Reactionary Crimes?

To the Editors:

I was deeply moved after reading the "Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" published in your newspaper consecutively from July 23rd to 28th, even though I have only read it once. The merit of this article lies in its vivid exposure based on the accounts of people who personally witnessed Wu Xun and suffered from his oppression and exploitation. This investigation has further clarified the reactionary stance of the Wu Xun propagandists. Some Wu Xun propagandists have also investigated in Wu Xun's hometown in Shandong and experienced life there. Why didn't they discover these materials and experience this real life? The main reason is that whether they are investigating materials or experiencing life, they always look at things from a reactionary standpoint. Therefore, what they see will never be the things of the working people. Of course, they cannot see the essence of Wu Xun as a big rogue, a big creditor, and a big landlord.

The first section of "Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" vividly narrates in detail the story of Song JingShi, the local peasant revolutionary leader who was Wu Xun's contemporary, thus thoroughly debunking the nonsense of Wu Xun's eulogizers about Wu Xun being "limited by specific historical conditions."

Other sections: Wu Xun's character, the nature of Wu Xun's schools... etc., also make those kind-hearted people who have been influenced by Wu Xun's propagandists no longer think that Wu Xun's "promoting education" and "asceticism" are always good.

These are my initial thoughts after reading it once.

Reader, Li Wen

### 武训歌颂者为什么不调查武训的反动劣迹？

     武训歌颂者为什么不调查武训的反动劣迹？编辑同志：
    上月二十三日到二十八日贵报连续发表的《武训历史调查记》，我虽然还只读了第一遍，但已非常感动。这篇文章的好处，就是从现在还亲眼见过武训、受过武训压迫剥削的人来作活生生的揭露。这一回的调查，使我更加明确了武训宣传者所站的反动立场了。有些武训宣传者，他们也曾到山东武训的家乡调查过，体验过生活，他们为什么竟未发现这些材料和体验到这些真实的生活呢？那主要是他们不论调查材料也罢，体验生活也罢，总是站在反动的立场上去看事物，因而所看到的东西，绝不会是劳动人民的东西。当然也就看不出武训这个大流氓、大债主、大地主的本质。
    《武训历史调查记》第一节，详细地生动地叙述了和武训同时的当地农民革命领袖宋景诗，由此彻底拆穿了武训歌颂者们所谓武训受“具体历史条件限制”的鬼话。
    其他各节：武训的为人，武训学校的性质……等，也使得那些受了武训宣传者影响的一些好心肠的人不再认为武训“兴学”“苦行”这一点总是好的了。
    这是我读了第一遍后的一点感想。
