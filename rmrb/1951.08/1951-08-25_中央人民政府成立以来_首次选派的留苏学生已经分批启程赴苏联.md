    首次选派的留苏学生已经分批启程赴苏联
    【新华社二十四日讯】我中央人民政府成立以来首次派赴苏联留学学生，已于本月十三、十九两日分批离京出国。
    中央人民政府教育部为着适应国家建设需要，培养专门人才，经与有关部门会商，并呈请政务院批准，决定选派在职干部及一部分大学生、中学毕业生赴苏联留学，学习苏联先进科学技术与文化知识。此次留学生中大部分是具有长期革命斗争历史的革命知识分子，学习范围包括理、工、农、医、师范教育及法政交通建设等。在赴苏留学生中，有进大学学习者，有进研究院深造者。
    行前曾在车站举行欢送会，到会欢送的有各有关部门首长和代表、苏联朋友及学生们的亲友。中央人民政府教育部副部长曾昭抡曾在会上致欢送词，勉励出国学生学好本领，建设祖国。会后，全体留学生在热烈的掌声中，登车启程。
