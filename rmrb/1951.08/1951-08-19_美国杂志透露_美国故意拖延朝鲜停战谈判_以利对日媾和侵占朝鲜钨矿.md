    U.S. Deliberately Delayed Korean Armistice Talks to Facilitate the Treaty with Japan and Seize Korean Tungsten Mines
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 15th] The recent two issues of the American magazine *Newsweek* revealed that the United States deliberately delayed the Korean armistice negotiations for the sake of diplomatic interests and strategic raw material resources. The August 13th issue of *Newsweek* stated: Dragging out the negotiations "is, in a diplomatic sense, in the West's favor. This is especially true regarding the Japanese peace treaty. As the armistice talks are delayed, more and more countries will accept the invitation to sign the treaty in San Francisco next month." The August 6th issue of *Newsweek* said: State Department officials know that if the armistice talks were to reach a conclusion sooner, then "after the armistice agreement is concluded, before the scheduled date of the San Francisco Peace Conference on Japan, September 4th, American diplomacy would encounter a decisive test."

    The August 13th issue of *Newsweek* also revealed that the desire to seize Korea's tungsten mines is "an important reason" why the United States insists on opposing the establishment of a ceasefire line along the 38th parallel in the Kaesong talks. The magazine said: "In this disputed area, there are large tungsten mines. At one point, Korea was a major supplier of this important metal, which is indispensable for manufacturing machine tools, electronic equipment, and jet engines. Currently, the shortage of tungsten is weakening the U.S. defense plan."

    美国故意拖延朝鲜停战谈判  以利对日媾和侵占朝鲜钨矿
    【新华社布拉格十五日电】最近两期的美国《新闻周刊》透露美国为了外交上的利益和战略原料资源而故意拖延朝鲜停战谈判。八月十三日的《新闻周刊》说：把谈判拖延下去，“在外交意义上说来，时间是对西方有利的。在对日和约问题上，尤其是如此。随着停战谈判的拖延，接受下月到旧金山签订和约的邀请的国家会越来越多。”八月六日的《新闻周刊》说：国务院官员们知道，如果停战谈判早日获致结果，那么，“在停战协议缔结以后，在旧金山对日和会的预定会期九月四日以前，美国外交会遇到一次决定性的考验”。
    八月十三日的《新闻周刊》还透露，要占有朝鲜的钨矿是美国在开城会谈中坚持反对沿三八线建立停战线的“一个重要理由”。该杂志说：“在这个双方所争的地区中有很大的钨矿。在某一点说来朝鲜是这一种制造工作母机、电子设备、和喷气式发动机所不可或缺的重要金属的主要供应国。目前，钨的奇缺正使美国防御计划松弛下来。”
