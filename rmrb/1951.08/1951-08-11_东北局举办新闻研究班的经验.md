Party Life

　　The Northeast Bureau held its first journalism study class from April 5th to July 10th. Its purpose was mainly to provide rotational training for cadres at the level of group leaders (or editorial board members) from various newspapers, studying the nature and tasks of newspaper work. Three months of study proved that rotational training is an important way to improve the ideological level of working journalists.

　　This is not only because newspaper workers often cannot be extensively detached for specialized study due to their work, but also because, according to the requirements of propaganda work, there is an urgent need to study the main problems existing in current newspaper work and to exchange experiences among the newspapers in order to improve cadres' understanding and ideological level of newspaper work.

　　To achieve this goal, seventeen group leader-level cadres from sixteen newspapers were selected to participate in the study. The content of the study, in addition to everyone reporting on the situation and problems of their respective newspapers at the beginning, mainly included studying "On Practice," rectifying writing style, popularization, and strengthening the ideological content of newspapers. The study method was based on self-study, supplemented by reports and discussions. When studying the issue of popularization, a week was also spent conducting surveys in factories and rural areas (targeting newspaper readers).

　　The study class's focus on the main problems existing in current newspaper work – understanding the nature and tasks of newspaper work – is why the study was relatively fruitful. These fruits can be summarized as follows:

　　First, it improved the understanding of newspaper work. Most comrades in the past did not have a deep understanding of the nature and tasks of newspapers, and many did not even understand that newspaper work is ideological work; they did not understand the essence of popularization and ideological content in newspapers. For example, Comrade Han Huafu, a member of the editorial board of the Heilongjiang Daily, wrote in his study心得 [xinde - insights gained through study or experience]: "I have been doing news work for more than five years, but how could I not even know what the nature and tasks of our newspapers are? Yes, I still don't know, or at least I don't know thoroughly, knowing what it is but not why it is. After studying, I have initially realized this, and found the way to do newspaper work well, and strengthened my confidence."

　　Second, it improved everyone's understanding of study. Many comrades used to think that poor study was mainly due to being busy with work. After studying, they realized that being busy and chaotic at work was not the cause of poor study, but the result of poor study. They ideologically recognized the truth taught by Chairman Mao that "the important thing is to be good at learning," and felt that they had suffered in the past from not studying seriously and not being good at learning; from ideological laziness; from reading without seeking thorough understanding and not paying attention to application. In short, they began to clarify the relationship between study and work, corrected their attitude towards study, and felt the necessity of strengthening study. Comrade Lü Xuexi, deputy editor-in-chief of the Lüda People's Daily, wrote in his study心得: "Because of my long-term lack of effort in learning, I often make mistakes in understanding problems and lack foresight in my work, so my work becomes passive; over time, I feel that the difficulties in my work are becoming more and more insurmountable, and I feel distressed and lack confidence in my work. ... I have gained a deeper understanding in this study of how to persevere in learning in the future."

　　Third, it improved everyone's political consciousness. Some comrades had many relatively serious problems in terms of ideology, work style, and Party spirit, but for a long time they did not adequately recognize the seriousness and harm of these problems, and lacked the necessary spirit of self-criticism. After this study, they began to improve their political consciousness, gained a relatively deep understanding of their problems, and laid a better foundation for further tempering and transforming themselves. For example, Comrade Sun Yuankun, the group leader of the Liaodong Mass Daily, wrote in his study心得: "This study made me correctly understand myself. In the past, although I knew that my level was low and my awareness was not high, I always thought that I was not bad. ... After this study, I have taken a step forward in my ideological and organizational cultivation. Looking back, I found that I am not as good as I thought in the past, I am too far behind, and many of the ideas I had in the past are wrong."

　　Fourth, it made everyone more clear about the direction of their efforts and learned working methods. Everyone further realized that strengthening ideological leadership, conscientiously implementing the decisions and instructions of higher authorities, doing a good job in mass work, and conducting investigation and research are very important for improving the entire newspaper work; clarifying that strengthening the popularization and ideological content of newspapers is the fundamental task of current newspaper work. For transforming themselves, everyone not only had a relatively deep understanding of their problems, but also more consciously realized the importance of strengthening criticism and self-criticism, strictly carrying out self-education, conscientiously transforming their ideology, thinking methods, and work style, and developing a spirit of diligence and hard work. For example, Comrade Meng He, director of the general editorial office of the Inner Mongolia Daily (Eastern Edition), wrote in his study心得: "My understanding of how to improve myself and do a good job has become clearer than before; thus, I have strengthened my confidence in my work and know what aspects I should work towards."

　　Although this journalism study class achieved many gains, it still had shortcomings. Due to the limited manpower of the Northeast Bureau's newspaper and magazine office, the lack of experience in running such study classes, and the uneven level of the students, the leadership was not deep and specific enough; on the student side, individual comrades lacked specific analysis and criticism of their own thoughts and work, and did not summarize their experiences well.

　　The experiences and lessons learned from holding this journalism study class are:

　　First, it is very necessary to conduct planned rotational training of key members of various newspapers, which is of great benefit to enlivening and improving the work of the editorial departments of various newspapers. Initially, many newspapers did not understand the purpose and significance of this study class, and were reluctant to send capable cadres to study, and some even delayed coming. After individual mobilization and urging, the newspapers began to take this matter more seriously, and the number of students increased from twelve to seventeen. This shows that in order to achieve the purpose of running a study class, it is necessary to mobilize the newspapers to carefully select and send capable cadres to study.

　　Second, before the start of each study period, the situation of each newspaper should be reported first; this can not only help the leading organs understand the situation, but also enable the participants to familiarize themselves with the situation and lay the foundation for joint research. During the study period, it is encouraged that everyone should inform their respective newspapers of their study心得 at any time by writing letters. This is not only a way to connect with reality, but also a way to promote the improvement of work in various newspapers in a timely manner through everyone's writing letters. Facts have proved that this method is very effective. Many newspapers attach great importance to these letters. Some newspapers post them, some read them out at meetings, and some organize comrades to discuss them in a timely manner. This has indeed played a certain role in improving work.

　　Third, in terms of study content, do not be greedy for more, and should focus on studying several major issues. When necessary, the study plan should be changed according to the new situation. For example, after studying "On Practice" and rectifying writing style in this period, the study plan was promptly changed according to the spirit of the Popular Newspaper and Magazine Conference and the National Propaganda Conference convened by the Central Propaganda Department, focusing on studying the popularization and ideological content of newspapers. But in any case, it is necessary to focus on solving the main problems in ideological understanding, and should not put the main energy on technical issues. Only in this way can we achieve the purpose of improving the fundamental understanding and political consciousness of newspaper workers. In order to achieve this goal, it is also necessary to constantly and patiently and sharply criticize the erroneous views of attaching importance to technology and neglecting politics, attaching importance to "practice" and neglecting theory, which exist in the minds of many newspaper workers; and be good at helping everyone correctly understand the relationship between theory and practice, and between knowing and doing through specific issues. Experience has proved that studying Chairman Mao's "On Practice" first is of great enlightenment and help to everyone.

　　Finally, strengthening ideological leadership, conscientiously carrying out criticism and self-criticism, improving everyone's understanding of the standards of Party members and the cultivation that Party newspaper workers should have, and launching ideological struggles against various incorrect views are not only very practical and vivid study content, but also the basic guarantee for running the study class well. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to earnestly strengthen the work of the study class Party branch. The fact that this study class has achieved greater gains is extremely related to the fact that the administration and the branch particularly paid attention to grasping ideological leadership.

### 东北局举办新闻研究班的经验

　　东北局举办新闻研究班的经验
    东北局宣传部从四月五日至七月十日，曾举办了第一期新闻研究班。其目的主要是轮训各报组长（或编委）一级的干部，研究报纸工作的性质和任务。经过三个月的学习，证明轮训是提高在职新闻干部思想水平的一个重要方式。
    这不仅因为报纸工作者常因工作关系，不能被大量地抽调进行专门的学习，而且根据宣传工作的要求，急需研究当前报纸工作中所存在的主要问题，并交流各报的经验，以提高干部对报纸工作的认识和思想水平。
    为达到这个目的，这次研究班共抽调了十六个报社的十七个组长级的干部，来参加学习。学习的内容，除开始时由大家汇报各报情况和问题外，主要是学习《实践论》、整顿文风、通俗化和加强报纸的思想性等四个问题。在学习方法上，则是以自学为主，报告与讨论为辅。研究通俗化问题时，并曾以一周的时间到工厂、农村进行了调查（对象是报纸的读者）。
    这次研究班的学习，正因为抓住了当前报纸工作中存在的主要问题——对报纸工作的性质和任务的认识，所以学习的收获也比较大。概括起来有以下四点：
    第一，提高了对报纸工作的认识。大多数同志过去对报纸的性质与任务，认识得不深刻，甚至许多人不了解报纸工作是思想工作；不了解报纸通俗化与思想性问题的实质。例如黑龙江日报的编委韩化夫同志在其学习心得中写道：“做新闻工作已经五年多了，难道连我们报纸的性质与任务是什么还不知道吗？是的，还不知道，或者说至少是知道得不彻底，知其然而不知其所以然。经过学习之后，我初步认识到了这一点，并且找到了做好报纸工作的门径，增强了自己的信心。”
    第二，提高了大家对学习的认识。许多同志过去认为学习差主要是由于工作忙的缘故，经过学习之后，才意识到工作忙乱不是学习差的原因，而是学习差的结果。从思想上认识了毛主席所教导我们的“重要问题在善于学习”的真理，并且感到过去吃了不认真学习和不善于学习的亏；吃了思想懒惰的亏；吃了读书不求甚解和不注意运用的亏。总之，开始明确了学习与工作的关系，端正了学习态度，深感有加强学习之必要。旅大人民日报副总编辑吕雪熙同志在其学习心得中写道：“由于自己长时期的不努力学习，认识问题时常出偏差，对工作缺乏远见，这样工作也就被动了；久而久之，也就感到工作中的困难越来越无法克服，对工作感到苦闷，缺乏信心。……如何使自己今后坚持学习，我在这次学习中有了较深刻的体会。”
    第三，提高了大家的政治觉悟。有些同志在思想、作风和党性等方面，虽然存在不少比较严重的毛病，但长期没有足够认识这些问题的严重性和危害性，并缺乏应有的自我批评精神。经过这次学习之后，开始提高了政治觉悟，比较深刻地认识了自己的毛病，并为进一步锻炼与改造自己，打下一个较好的基础。例如《辽东大众报》的组长孙元坤同志在其学习心得中写道：“这次学习使我正确地认识了自己。以往虽说我也知道自己水平低，觉悟不高，但总认为自己还不错。……经过这次学习，我从思想上组织修养上提高了一步。我回顾了一下，发现自己并不是像过去想的那样，自己差得太远了，而且以往那些想法，很多是不对头的。”
    第四，使大家更加明确了努力的方向，学习了工作方法。大家都进一步认识到加强思想领导、认真贯彻上级决定和指示、做好群众工作、调查研究等问题，对于改进整个报纸工作是很重要的；弄清了加强报纸通俗化与思想性，是当前报纸工作的根本任务。对改造自己来说，大家不仅比较深刻地认识了自己的毛病，并且也比较自觉地认识到加强批评与自我批评、严格进行自我教育、认真改造自己的思想意识、思想方法和作风、养成勤学苦干精神等问题的重要。如内蒙古日报（东部版）的总编室主任蒙和同志在其学习心得中写道：“我对怎样才能提高自己，把工作搞好，认识较前更加明确了；因而加强了工作信心，并知道应该向那方面努力了。”
    这次新闻研究班虽然取得不少收获，但还是有缺点的。由于东北局报刊处的人力有限，又缺乏办这种研究班的经验，以及学员的水平不齐等等原因，所以在领导方面还不够深入和具体；在学员方面，个别同志对自己的思想和工作缺乏具体的分析、批判，没有很好地总结自己的经验。
    这次举办新闻研究班的经验教训是：
    首先，有计划地轮训各报骨干分子，是非常必要的，这对活跃与提高各报编辑部的工作，大有好处。最初许多报社不了解这一研究班的目的与意义，舍不得选派得力干部前来学习，甚至有的迟迟不来。经过个别动员与督促，各报才比较认真地对待这件事情，学习人数遂由十二人增至十七人。这说明要达到办研究班的目的，必须动员各报认真选派得力干部前来学习。
    其次，每期开始学习之前，应先汇报各报情况；这不仅可以帮助领导机关了解情况，并使参加学习的人也能互相熟悉一下情况，打下共同研究的基础。在学习期间，提倡大家随时将学习心得写信告知所属报社，这不仅是一种联系实际的方式，并且通过大家写信，也可以及时推动各报改进工作。事实证明，这种方式是很有效果的，许多报社十分重视这种信件，有的报社把它张贴，有的在会议上宣读，有的及时组织同志们讨论。这对改进工作确实起了一定的作用。
    再次，在学习内容上，不要贪多，应集中学习几个主要问题。必要时学习计划应根据新的情况加以改变，如这期学过《实践论》与整顿文风之后，即及时根据中央宣传部所召集的通俗报刊会议与全国宣传会议的精神，改变学习计划，集中研究报纸的通俗化与思想性。但无论如何必须抓紧解决思想认识上的主要问题，而不应把主要精力放在技术问题上。只有这样才能达到提高报纸工作者的根本认识，提高政治觉悟的目的。为了达到这一目的，还须不断地耐心地尖锐地批判存在于许多报纸工作者思想中的轻政治、重技术，轻理论、“重实际”等错误观点；并要善于通过具体问题帮助大家正确地认识理论与实践、知与行的关系。经验证明，先学习毛主席的《实践论》，对大家的启发和帮助是很大的。
    最后，加强思想领导，认真开展批评与自我批评，提高大家对党员标准和党报工作者应有的修养的认识，和对各种不正确的观点展开思想斗争，不仅是非常实际和生动的学习内容，并且也是办好研究班的基本保证。为了达到这一目的，必须认真加强研究班党支部的工作。这一期研究班能得到较大的收获，是和行政上与分支部特别注意抓紧思想领导有极大的关系。
