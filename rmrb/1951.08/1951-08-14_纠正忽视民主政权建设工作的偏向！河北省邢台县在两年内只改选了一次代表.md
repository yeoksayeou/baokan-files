    Correct the Tendency to Neglect the Construction of Democratic Power!
  　Xingtai County, Hebei Province, Only Re-elected Representatives Once in Two Years
    Leading cadres in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, disregard the construction of democratic power, and the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the county has become a mere formality.
    Xingtai County and Xingtai Town were merged at the end of last year. Since 1949, the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the county has been held six times, the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the town has been held five times, and one meeting has been held after the county and town merged. In the early stage of democratic construction, the county and town held a People's Representative Conference of All Circles about every two months, but as time went on, the time interval between them became longer and longer. The interval between the meeting after the county and town merged and the previous meeting was as long as half a year, and each meeting was worse than the previous one. In the initial stage of holding the People's Representative Conference of All Circles, the representatives would first solicit opinions from the masses, and after the meeting was closed, they would organize the representatives to go back to convey them; but as time went on, there was less and less preparation, and the last People's Representative Conference of All Circles was hastily convened without even knowing who the representatives were.
    In a period of about two years, the representatives of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the county were only re-elected once, and the representatives of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the town were never re-elected. Therefore, the number of representatives after the merger of the county and town has decreased significantly. The first People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the county had 500 representatives, and the second had only 250; the representatives of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the town decreased from 150 at the beginning to 90. One of the reasons for the decrease in the number of representatives is that some people have died and some have left, and the county has not held by-elections. When the County People's Representative Conference of All Circles was held after the merger of the county and town, some representatives asked for leave, some representatives found substitutes, and some sons replaced their fathers. This is completely different from the solemn atmosphere when the People's Representative Conference of All Circles was first held, and such a People's Representative Conference will certainly not be effective.
    There are several reasons why the county and town People's Representative Conferences of All Circles have become like this:
    First, the leading cadres of the county and town have a simple utilitarian view of the People's Representative Conference. They convene it when the higher authorities assign tasks, and don't convene it when there are no tasks. Because the main purpose of the meeting is to arrange work, many cadres attend, which actually turns it into a cadre meeting. For example, the County People's Representative Conference of All Circles convened last year to arrange the summer grain requisition task had only 200 representatives, but about 600 people attended. As a result, only cadres spoke at the meeting, and representatives did not participate, forming a situation in which the guest overwhelmed the host. However, the leading cadres of the county and town still felt that the People's Representative Conference of All Circles could not replace the cadre meeting; after it was held, they had to convene another cadre meeting to arrange work, so they mistakenly thought that this was "a blind man wearing glasses, adding an extra layer," and gradually became indifferent to convening the People's Representative Conference of All Circles. The representatives also felt disheartened and disappointed, because each meeting brought a set of tasks, and after returning, they could not pass the village cadres' hurdle and could not complete them well.
    Second, cadres have privileged ideas and undemocratic work styles. After ordinary people are elected as representatives, they feel honored, but some cadres who are elected as representatives are unwilling to sit in the representative seats, do not abide by the meeting rules, are late and leave early, and show special treatment everywhere. Speaking at the meeting is like lecturing, and representatives are criticized casually. For example, a district cadre once criticized a representative at a group discussion, saying that his "speech was incorrect," and a cadre in the county casually criticized a capitalist representative for being "selfish." This dampened the enthusiasm of the representatives and made it impossible to hold the meeting well. The reason why some cadres in the county do not respect the representatives is mainly because they mistakenly believe: "You (referring to the representatives) are the masses, and I am a cadre."
    Third, the handling of proposals is not serious enough, and the interests of all circles of the people are not taken into account. Although the central topics of each People's Representative Conference of All Circles convened in the county and town can be combined with the demands of the masses, some representatives always feel that they cannot solve their own problems, so they think that it is "a meeting for others."

### 纠正忽视民主政权建设工作的偏向！河北省邢台县在两年内只改选了一次代表

    纠正忽视民主政权建设工作的偏向！
  　河北省邢台县在两年内只改选了一次代表
    河北省邢台县领导干部轻视民主政权的建设工作，县各界人民代表会议流于形式。
    邢台县和邢台镇是在去年年底合并的。自一九四九年以来，县各界人民代表会议开过六次，镇各界人民代表会议开过五次，县、镇合并后开过一次。开始民主建政的初期，县、镇都是大约两个月召开一次各界人民代表会议，但越往后，中间间隔的时间越长，县镇合并后的一次会议距离上次会议竟达半年之久，而且一次会议开得不如一次。在最初举行各界人民代表会议时，先由代表征求群众意见，会议闭幕后又组织代表回去传达了；但越往后越无准备，最后召开的一次各界人民代表会议更是临时抓来就开，连那些人是代表都搞不清。
    在大约两年的时间内，该县各界人民代表会议的代表只改选过一次，镇各界人民代表会议的代表则始终没有改选过，因此县镇合并后代表的数目已显著减少。县第一届各界人民代表会议的代表是五百人，第二届就只有二百五十人；镇各界人民代表会议的代表则由开始时的一百五十人减少到九十人。代表减少的原因之一，是有些人已经死了，有些人已经离开了，而该县也没有补选。县镇合并后召开县各界人民代表会议时，有代表请假不来的，有代表找人顶替的，有儿子代替父亲的。这一些与刚开始举行各界人民代表会议时的严肃气氛已完全不一样，这样的人民代表会议当然不会发生作用。
    该县的县、镇各界人民代表会议所以开成这样，有下面几个原因：
    第一、县、镇的领导干部对人民代表会议存有单纯使用观点，上级交下任务就召开，没有就不开。因为会议的主要目的是布置工作，列席的干部就相当多，实际变成了干部会。如去年为了布置夏征任务召开的县各界人民代表会议，代表只有二百人，列席的就约有六百人。结果会议中只见干部发言，不见代表活动，形成喧宾夺主的现象。不过该县、镇的领导干部仍然觉得各界人民代表会议不能代替干部会；开过了，还得再召集干部会布置工作，因而错误地认为这是“瞎子带眼镜，外加一层”，对于召开各界人民代表会议也就逐渐冷淡下来。而代表也感到灰心失望，因为开一次会带一套任务，回去后又过不了村干部的关，不能很好完成。
    第二、干部有特权思想，作风不民主。一般群众当选代表后觉得光荣，而有些干部当了代表，则不愿意往代表席位上坐，也不遵守会场规则，迟到早退，处处表现特殊。在会上发言就好像是训话，并且随便批评代表。如一个区干部就曾经在小组讨论会上批评某位代表，说他“发言不正确”，县里一位干部更随便批评一个资本家代表“自私自利”。这样就打击了代表的积极性，使会议无法开好。该县有些干部之所以不尊重代表，主要是他们错误地认为：“你（指代表）是群众，我是干部。”
    第三、提案处理不够认真，没有照顾到各界人民的利益。该县、镇每次召开的各界人民代表会议，虽然中心议题多能与群众的要求相结合；但有些代表却总觉得不能解决本身问题，因此认为是“给别人开会”。
