　　Since the Kaesong Armistice Negotiations,
    US Planes Have Continuously Bombed Residential Areas of Pyongyang
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 23rd] (TASS dispatch from Pyongyang, August 22nd) US planes continue to bomb Pyongyang. They fly over the city almost every day to drop bombs and strafe, dropping more than 600 bombs in the past three days. Time bombs explode daily.
    Park Keun-shik, Vice-Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, denounced the atrocities of the US planes bombing Pyongyang, saying that since the start of the Kaesong peace talks, US planes have intensified their barbaric air raids. For example, in the forty days from June 1st to the start of the Kaesong negotiations (July 10th), US planes ravaged Pyongyang more than 80 times; in the subsequent forty-one days (from July 11th to August 20th), the number of times US planes ravaged Pyongyang increased to 250 times, and the number of bombs dropped also increased accordingly. In the past month alone, more than 4,000 heavy bombs have been dropped on the city.
    The purpose of these barbaric air raids by US air pirates on Pyongyang and other cities in northern Korea is to kill civilians and destroy homes. The air raids on Pyongyang prove this. For example, on August 14th, US fighter planes flew low and strafed the most densely populated areas of the city in clear skies. The bombs dropped by the US air fortresses all fell in the most densely populated central area of the city - the city's commercial district. This indiscriminate bombing has turned entire blocks of houses on the streets into rubble. In Pyongyang, a city without a single military target, US planes destroyed more than 5,000 homes, killed more than 4,000 residents, and injured more than 2,500 residents between July 10th and August 20th.
    Park Keun-shik said: All this is enough to prove that the purpose of the US interventionists' air raids on Korean cities - especially Pyongyang - is to intimidate the people and make the Korean people submit. While ravaging Pyongyang and slaughtering women, children, and the elderly, the US aggressors are spreading rumors that there are military targets in the city to justify their atrocities. For example, the Tokyo radio station of Ridgway broadcast a communiqué from the United Nations Command saying that 500 bombs were dropped on Pyongyang's military warehouses on the night of August 1st to before dawn on August 2nd. This communiqué is a lie, because there are no military targets in Pyongyang. The fact is that more than 150 residents were killed or injured and 188 residents' houses were destroyed due to the indiscriminate bombing of the city by the US that night from the clouds.
    This is the truth about the US planes' ravaging of cities and villages in northern Korea, which they are trying their best to prevent world public opinion from knowing. The people of Pyongyang are deeply indignant at the barbaric acts of the US air pirates in harming residents, and they demand that the criminals who planned and carried out these atrocities be punished.

### 开城停战谈判以来  美机连炸平壤居民区

　　开城停战谈判以来
    美机连炸平壤居民区
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社平壤二十二日讯：美国飞机继续轰炸平壤。它们几乎天天飞到这个城市上空来投炸弹和扫射，在过去三天中就投了六百多枚炸弹。每天都有定时炸弹爆炸。
    平壤市人民委员会副委员长朴根植（译音）斥责美国飞机滥炸平壤的暴行说，从开城和谈开始以来，美国飞机特别加紧进行野蛮的空袭。例如在从六月一日至开城谈判开始（七月十日）四十天当中，美国飞机前来平壤肆虐八十多次；而在后来的四十一天（从七月十一日至八月二十日）当中，美国飞机前来平壤肆虐次数增加到二百五十次，投弹数目也跟着增加。在最近一个月当中，单是对这个城市投的巨型炸弹就有四千多枚。
    美国空中强盗对平壤以及朝鲜北部其他城市进行这一切野蛮的空袭的目的，是在于杀害老百姓和破坏住宅。对平壤进行的空袭证明了这一点。例如在八月十四日，美国战斗机在晴朗的天空中低飞扫射市内人口最密集的地区。美国空中堡垒所投的炸弹都落在市内人口最密集的中心区——市内商业区。这种滥炸已使街道上的整片房屋成为一片瓦砾。在平壤这个连一个军事目标也没有的城市，美国飞机在七月十日至八月二十日这段时间中，摧毁了住宅五千多栋，杀死居民四千多人，杀伤居民二千五百多人。
    朴根植说：这一切足以证明美国干涉者空袭朝鲜城市——特别是平壤——是为了恐吓老百姓，使朝鲜人民屈膝。美国侵略者一面对平壤肆虐，残杀妇女、儿童和老年人；一面造谣说市内有军事目标，来为他们的暴行辩解。例如李奇微的东京电台广播联合国军司令部的公报说，在八月一日晚间至八月二日黎明以前向平壤军事仓库投了五百枚炸弹。这个公报是谎话，因为平壤并没有军事目标，事实是由于美国在那一夜晚在云层上空对这个城市滥施轰炸，居民一百五十多人遭到伤亡，居民的房屋一百八十八栋被炸毁。
    这就是美国飞机对朝鲜北部城市和村庄肆虐而又竭力想不让全世界舆论界知道的真相。平壤人民对美国空中强盗残害居民的野蛮行为深感愤慨，他们要求惩罚计划和执行这种暴行的罪犯。
