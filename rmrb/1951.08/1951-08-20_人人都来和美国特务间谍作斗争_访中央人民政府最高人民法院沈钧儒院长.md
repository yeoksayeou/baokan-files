　　Everyone Come and Fight Against American Special Agents and Spies
    ——Interview with Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government
    Zhu Bo
    Regarding the verdict by the Military Tribunal of the Beijing Military Control Commission on the case of American special agents and spies plotting an armed rebellion, the reporter interviewed Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government.
    When the reporter entered President Shen's office, he was reviewing the Beijing newspapers of the day. He said indignantly, "The Chinese people cannot tolerate the American imperialists' so brazen attempt to harm our country's leaders by using their special agents and spies."
    President Shen pointed to the People's Daily of the day and said: From the indictment of the Beijing People's Procuratorate and the verdict of the Military Tribunal of the Military Control Commission, we can clearly see that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. Before liberation, it took in all the remnants of fascism and engaged in espionage activities to undermine the Chinese people's liberation cause; after liberation, it instructed the heinous spies such as Li An-tung and Yamaguchi Ryuichi to lurk down by various means, waiting for the opportunity to plot riots; and prepared weapons such as mortars in advance, secretly measured the situation of Tiananmen Square, and drew drawings of shooting Tiananmen Square, plotting to shell Tiananmen Square on National Day. This huge conspiracy case hostile to the Chinese people makes the Chinese people clearly realize that if we do not eliminate those extremely sinful special agent and spy elements with the United States as their background, the Chinese people will not have peace. It is absolutely necessary to impose due punishment on these special agents and spies in accordance with the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries."
    All counter-revolutionaries are hostile to the people. President Shen deeply experienced this issue from his many years of struggle. He recalled what the famous warmonger Marshall said to him in Chongqing in the past: "Looking at Soviet democracy from the perspective of Americans (should be read as American imperialism), it is not considered democracy." Similarly, another American warmonger, Wedemeyer, also said to him in Shanghai: "The revolution of the Chinese Communist Party has brought very dangerous ideas." When President Shen recalled these imperialist elements, he pointed to Yamaguchi Ryuichi's confession and said: "Look, Yamaguchi Ryuichi's confession says: 'I have a hostile attitude towards the Soviet Communist Party, and I am equally hostile to the Chinese Communist Party.' The tone of these imperialist spy elements is completely consistent, they are all against the people, which is no different from the counter-revolutionary elements in our country." Then President Shen very familiarly turned to Stalin's talk with the foreign workers' delegation on November 5, 1927, and pointed to one of the paragraphs and said: Let's see what Stalin said about this issue: "...Our internal enemies are not an isolated thing, they have thousands of ties with the capitalists of various countries..." Isn't the specific situation in our country also like this? The conspiracy activities carried out by American spies such as Li An-tung and Yamaguchi Ryuichi are coordinated with the conspiracy activities of domestic counter-revolutionary elements.
    Finally, when the reporter asked President Shen, "What is the significance of today's verdict on the case of American spies plotting an armed rebellion in the current situation of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea?" President Shen said: This question is very clear. This is another great victory won in the struggle against U.S. aggression and defending our national security. It is of the same nature as the victory won by the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front. The special agent and spy elements of American imperialism are indispensable vanguards in launching aggressive wars. Therefore, our crackdown on the conspiracy activities of American spies is a direct blow to the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism.
    President Shen repeatedly stated that in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, this great victory should be used to educate the people of the whole country and announced to the people of the world, so that the people of the whole country and the world can more deeply understand the hideous face of American imperialism, so that the people of the whole country can act more actively, carry forward the heroic spirit and wisdom shown in the past in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and be vigilant at all times against the conspiracy activities of American spies, and strive to thoroughly eliminate the hidden American special agent and spy elements.

　　人人都来和美国特务间谍作斗争
    ——访中央人民政府最高人民法院沈钧儒院长
    朱波
    记者就北京市军事管制委员会军法处判决美国特务间谍阴谋武装暴动案，访问了中央人民政府最高人民法院沈钧儒院长。
    当记者走进沈院长的办公室时，他正在翻阅当日北京市各报。他愤愤地说：“美帝国主义利用其特务间谍，如此狂妄地企图谋害我国元首的阴谋事件，中国人民是不能容忍的。”
    沈院长指着当天的人民日报说：从北京市人民检察署的起诉书，及军事管制委员会军法处的判决书中，我们可以清楚地看到，美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌。在解放前，它就收容了一切法西斯残余，从事间谍活动，破坏中国人民解放事业；解放以后，它又指使李安东、山口隆一等万恶的间谍，用各种方法潜伏下来，等待时机，阴谋暴动；并且预先就自备了迫击炮等武器，秘密测量了天安门形势，绘制射击天安门的图样，阴谋于国庆日炮击天安门。这种敌视中国人民的巨大的阴谋案，使中国人民清楚地认识到，如果不肃清那些罪大恶极的以美国为背景的特务间谍分子，中国人民将不得安宁。对于这些特务间谍分子，根据“惩治反革命条例”，处以应得之罪，是完全必要的。
    一切反革命分子都是敌视人民的。沈院长从自己许多年的斗争中，深深地体验到这一问题，他回忆了过去在重庆时，著名战争贩子马歇尔对他说的一句话：“以美国人（应读为美帝国主义）的眼光看苏联的民主，就认为不是民主。”同样，另一个美国战争贩子魏德迈，在上海时也对他说过：“中国共产党的革命，带来了非常危险的思想。”沈院长回忆到这些帝国主义分子时，他指着山口隆一的口供说：“你看，山口隆一的口供说：‘我有仇视苏联共产党的思想，对中国共产党也同样敌对。’这些帝国主义间谍分子的口吻是完全一致的，都是反对人民的，这和我国内部的反革命分子是没有两样的。”接着沈院长非常熟习地翻出斯大林在一九二七年十一月五日与外国工人代表团的谈话，指着其中的一段说：看一看斯大林对这个问题怎样说的吧：“……我们内部的敌人并不是一个孤立的东西，他们与各国的资本家有千丝万缕的联系……。”我国的具体情况不也是这样吗？像美国间谍李安东、山口隆一等所进行的阴谋活动，和国内反革命分子的阴谋活动，是相互配合的。
    最后，记者以“今天判决美国间谍阴谋武装暴动案在目前抗美援朝斗争形势中有什么意义，”来询问沈院长时，沈院长说：这个问题很明显，这是在反对美国侵略、保卫我们祖国安全的斗争中，所获得的又一次伟大胜利，这和英勇的中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线所得的胜利，其性质是一样的。美帝国主义的特务间谍分子是其发动侵略战争中不可缺少的先头部队，因此，我们打击了美国间谍的阴谋活动，也就是直接打击了美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    沈院长一再表示，要巩固人民民主专政，应该把这一巨大的胜利，用来教育全国人民，并向全世界人民宣布，让全国及全世界人民都能更深刻地认识美帝国主义的狰狞面目，使全国人民更积极地行动起来，发扬过去在镇压反革命运动中所表现的英勇精神与智慧，时时刻刻警惕美国间谍的阴谋活动，为彻底肃清暗藏的美国特务间谍分子而努力。
