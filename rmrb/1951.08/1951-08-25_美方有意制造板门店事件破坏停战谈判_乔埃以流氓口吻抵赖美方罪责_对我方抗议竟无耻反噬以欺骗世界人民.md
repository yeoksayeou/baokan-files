　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 24th: This reporter reports: The absurd reply made by Joy, the chief representative of the United Nations Command delegation, on August 22nd to the serious protest made by our chief representative, General Nan Ri, on August 19th, and the vicious slanders spread by the US side to quibble about the murder of our military police personnel, have aroused great anger among people from all walks of life here, who believe that this is a powerful proof that the US side intends to sabotage the negotiations.
　　At 5:55 a.m. on August 19th, armed personnel of the United Nations Command, who had sneaked into the neutral zone in advance, suddenly attacked nine of our military police officers who were on patrol duty near Songgok-ri, southwest of Panmunjom, killing Yao Qingxiang, the platoon leader of our military police, and seriously wounding Wang Renyuan, a soldier of our side. Less than three hours after this incident occurred, our side notified the other side to send personnel to the scene for a joint investigation. During the investigation, both sides listened to the reports of local residents and our military police personnel, and examined various physical evidence, which fully confirmed the truth of this illegal sneak attack. If the US side had the slightest sincerity, it should have given a satisfactory reply to the fair demands put forward in General Nan Ri's serious protest on the 19th in the face of irrefutable ironclad evidence, namely: severely punish the murderers and guarantee that no more incidents violating the neutral zone agreement will occur.
　　However, the US side, which is deliberately sabotaging the negotiations, has adopted a shameless and quibbling attitude towards such a serious incident, and fabricated vicious slanders in an attempt to cover up the sky with one hand and counterattack our side. Two days after General Nan Ri lodged a serious protest, Joy put forward the first simple reply on August 21st. In this reply, Joy, on the one hand, claimed that he had not yet received a "detailed investigation report" on the incident of sabotaging the neutral zone, and on the other hand, arbitrarily asserted: "The preliminary report has not proved that your protest is in line with the facts." Joy's reply shows that the US side decided from the beginning to adopt a quibbling attitude. Joy's quibbling attitude was further confirmed in the report issued by the US side on the same day (21st) regarding the incident of violating the neutral zone. This report, using the excuse that it could not prove that "some of the attackers were wearing steel helmets - the standard equipment of all United Nations regular forces," asserted that the "identity" of the attackers could not be determined, in an attempt to create a "basis" for the US side's formal denial in the future. Not only that, but what is especially vile and despicable is that this report also foolishly and viciously attempted to shift the responsibility for the murder of our military police personnel by US armed personnel to our side. The report said: "It is possible that this shooting incident was carried out by a politically instigated plainclothes team on orders, with the purpose of creating a tense atmosphere sufficient to cause the current military armistice conference to break down." And the day before this report was published, Nakos, a spokesman for the United Nations Command delegation, shamelessly issued a slander saying: This attack "may have been carried out by North Korean guerrillas," and North Korea "believes that they should continue their war against South Korea." This clumsy trick of the US side, which attempts to sow discord between the Chinese and Korean people and cry "stop thief!" will never be able to deceive the truth about the US side's repeated sabotage of the neutral zone. This trick can only be spurned by all just people in the world and arouse the greatest anger of the Chinese and Korean people.
　　On August 22nd, Joy sent a formal reply to General Nan Ri's protest. In this reply, he still completely denied the US side's guilt in this armed sabotage of the neutral zone and similar incidents on July 16th and August 7th. Regarding the US side's sabotage of the neutral zone on August 19th, Joy also attached a lengthy appendix. In the appendix, although Joy had to admit that "the time and circumstances of the patrol being attacked are the same as those reported to you by your liaison officer (according to General Nan Ri)," he still insisted that "the identity of the attackers could not be determined, only that they were a group of armed personnel," using the excuse that the attackers "some were wearing uniforms," "some were wearing plain clothes," and "no one was seen wearing a steel helmet," and therefore he could not be responsible. Joy has not and cannot provide any convincing evidence as to why this "group of armed personnel" does not belong to the United Nations Command. Joy's excuse of the attackers' clothing to shirk the US side's guilt is extremely absurd. Because, since the US side "judged" that this group of armed personnel was "ordered to create" the incident, could they not be "ordered" not to wear steel helmets, and some be "ordered" to change into plain clothes?
　　Joy also said shamelessly in the reply: "It is entirely your responsibility to control the guerrillas in the neutral zone." "You should be entirely responsible for the failure to maintain order in the neutral zone." Joy attempted to completely shirk the US side's responsibility for this crime with such an unreasonable "argument." According to Joy's "argument," no matter whether the attackers are US troops or not, whether they are the Li Seung-man puppet army or not, in any case, the Korean and Chinese sides should be responsible, and it has nothing to do with the US side. This is completely the tone of a Chicago-style gangster. Joy's "argument" not only attempts to deny the US side's responsibility for this crime, but also opens the back door for the US side to continue to violate the neutral zone agreement in the future. Joy completely revealed this conspiracy in the appendix to the reply. Although the US side had previously talked nonsense that this attack was "carried out by North Korean guerrillas" before this note, a "citizen of the Republic of Korea" was brought up in this appendix. Joy said in the appendix: "The United Nations Command cannot control or be responsible for citizens in the Republic of Korea area occupied by your army automatically taking up arms to resist an invader." As everyone knows, the so-called "citizens of the Republic of Korea" are 100% docile lackeys of the American aggressors. Joy's remarks not only refute that the "United Nations Command" is the chief instigator of this attack, but also show that the US side is determined to continue to violate the neutral zone in the future, continue to kill our personnel, and make negotiations impossible. All peace-loving people in the world must see through this treacherous plan of the US side and thoroughly expose it.

　　美方有意制造板门店事件破坏停战谈判
    乔埃以流氓口吻抵赖美方罪责
    对我方抗议竟无耻反噬以欺骗世界人民
    【新华社开城二十四日电】本报记者报道：联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃八月二十二日对我方首席代表南日将军十九日提出的严重抗议的荒谬答复以及美方为狡赖谋杀我方军事警察人员所散布的恶毒诽谤，在此间各界人士中激起极大的愤怒，认为这正是美方有意破坏谈判的一个有力佐证。
    八月十九日上午五时五十五分，预先潜入中立区的联合国军武装人员，在板门店西南的松谷里附近，突然袭击我方担任巡逻任务的军事警察九人，打死我方军事警察排长姚庆祥，重伤我方战士王仁元。在这一事件发生后不及三小时，我方即通知对方派员共同至现场调查。双方在调查中，听取了当地居民及我方军事警察人员的报告，检验了各种物证，完全证实了这一非法偷袭事件的真相。如果美方稍具诚意，理应在不可辩驳的铁证面前，对南日将军十九日严重抗议中所提出的公允要求，给以满意的答复，即：严惩凶手，保证不再发生任何违反中立区协议的事件。
    但是，蓄意破坏谈判的美方，对于这样严重的事件，却采取了无耻狡赖的态度，并制造了恶毒的诽谤，企图一手遮天，反噬我方。在南日将军提出严重抗议之后，隔了两天，乔埃才于八月二十一日提出第一个简单的答复。在这个答复中，乔埃一方面扬言他还未收到关于破坏中立区事件的“详细调查报告”，另方面却武断地肯定：“初步报告未证明你方的抗议合乎事实。”乔埃这个答复表明：美方一开始就决定了采取狡赖的态度。乔埃的狡赖态度，在美方于同日（二十一日）发表的关于违反中立区事件的报告中，得到了进一步的证实。这个报告借口无法证明“袭击者中有人头戴钢盔——一切联合国正规部队的标准装备”，断言袭击者的“身份”无法判明，企图以此来为美方今后的正式抵赖，制造“根据”。不仅如此，尤其下流可鄙的是，这个报告还愚蠢而又恶毒地企图把美方武装人员杀害我方军事警察人员的责任，转嫁到我方身上。该报告说：“有可能这一射击事件是在政治上受人指使的便衣队奉令制造的，目的是造成一种足以促使目前的军事停战会议破裂的紧张空气。”而在这报告发表的前一天，联合国军代表团发言人纳科斯即无耻地发出诽谤说：这次袭击“可能是北朝鲜游击队干的”，北朝鲜“认为应该把他们对南朝鲜的战争继续下去”。美方这种妄图挑拨中朝人民团结、做贼喊贼的笨拙伎俩，决不能蒙蔽美方一再破坏中立区事件的真相。它这种伎俩只能受到全世界一切公正人士的唾弃，激起中、朝两国人民的最大愤怒。
    八月二十二日，乔埃送来了对南日将军抗议的正式复文。他在这一复文中仍然完全抵赖美方在这次武装破坏中立区事件以及美方在七月十六日、八月七日类似事件上的罪责。关于美方八月十九日破坏中立区的事件，乔埃并附来了一个冗长的附件。乔埃在附件中，虽然不得不承认“巡逻队被攻击的时间与情况和你（按指南日将军）的联络员向你报告的一样”，但仍然借口袭击者“有些人身穿制服”、“一部分穿便衣”、“未看到有人戴钢盔”等等，硬说“袭击者身份未能判定，仅知他们是一群武装人员”，因而他不能负责。乔埃对于这“一群武装人员”何以不属于联合国军，没有也决不可能提出任何令人信服的证据。乔埃以袭击者的衣着为借口来推卸美方罪责，是极端荒唐的。因为，美方既然“判断”这群武装人员是“奉令制造”事件的，难道他们不能“奉令”不戴钢盔，一部分“奉令”换上便衣吗？
    乔埃在复文中还无耻地说：“控制中立区内的游击队完全是你们的责任。”“在中立区内未能维持秩序的责任完全应由你们负。”乔埃企图以这样横蛮无理的“论据”来完全推卸美方对此次罪行的责任。根据乔埃这种“论据”，不论袭击者是美军也罢、不是美军也罢，是李承晚伪军也罢、不是李承晚伪军也罢，反正都要由朝、中方面负责，与美方毫不相干。这完全是芝加哥式流氓的口吻。乔埃这种“论据”，不仅企图抵赖美方此次罪行的责任，而且为美方今后继续破坏中立区的协议，开辟了后门。乔埃在复文的附件中就完全透露了这个阴谋。尽管在这次照会之前美方曾胡说什么这次袭击是“北朝鲜游击队干的”，但在这个附件中却又扯出了一个“大韩民国公民”来。乔埃在附件中说：“联合国司令部对于在你方军队占领下的大韩民国地区内的公民自动拿起武器抵抗一个入侵者，无法控制，也不负责任。”尽人皆知，所谓“大韩民国公民”乃是美国侵略者百分之百的驯服走狗。乔埃的这段话，不仅反证“联合国司令部”是这次袭击事件的主谋者，而且还表明美方决心在今后还要继续破坏中立区，继续杀害我方人员，使谈判根本无法进行。全世界一切爱好和平的人们必须洞察美方的这种奸计，并予以彻底的揭露。
