Recommending the "Defend Peace" Magazine
    Lin Chao

    The "Defend Peace" magazine is a specialized publication discussing issues of concern to the people of the world regarding the defense of peace, according to the resolutions of the first meeting of the World Peace Council in Berlin. Pierre Cot, leader of the French Progressive Party and member of the World Peace Council, serves as the president of the magazine, with French writer Claude Morgan as the editor-in-chief, and Chinese writer Mao Dun as one of the magazine's advisors. The inaugural issue was published in June, and the Chinese version translated by the China Peace Committee has also been published. This is a very lively and interesting magazine, worthy of everyone's reading.

    The main content of the inaugural issue is a discussion on the peaceful coexistence of two systems. In addition to the editorial "Peaceful Coexistence of Two Systems and the Five-Power Pact" written by Pierre Cot, participants in this discussion include Oscar Lange, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Polish Parliament, Luigi Gedda, member of the Italian Christian Democratic Party, Soviet writer Ehrenburg, Branting, member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, Nobel Prize winner Gabriela Mistral, Mrs. Blum, member of the Belgian Socialist Party, and Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government of China, among many others. Their discussions are all based on facts and filled with sincere emotion, making the articles very infectious and not at all boring to read.

    This issue also includes several newsletters, which are also some very interesting literary works. From them, one can see how strongly the people all over the world love peace and how extremely they hate the imperialist conspiracy to launch wars of aggression, based on their own past experiences.

    The magazine also has three small columns: "Chess," "Sports," and "Cuisine from Four Continents." This issue's "Chess" column published an introduction to Soviet chess by Soviet international chess grandmaster Smyslov and Panov. Future issues will continuously publish chess skills and competition news. The "Sports" column reported on sports activities in Paris, Italy, Hungary, and other places. "Cuisine from Four Continents" introduced the preparation method of Valencia rice, etc. in the United States. These things may seem like trivial matters unrelated to the serious issue of "defending peaceful coexistence," but in reality, they are indispensable components of our peaceful life. People who love such a peaceful life will naturally oppose the imperialist war policy and the bloodthirsty warmongers. Treating these things as part of the magazine's content is enough to vividly show the world's people's desire to love a peaceful life.

　　向大家推荐《保卫和平》杂志
    林朝
    《保卫和平》杂志是根据柏林世界和平理事会第一届会议的决议出版的专门讨论世界人民所关心的保卫和平问题的杂志。法国进步党领袖、世界和平理事会理事皮尔·戈特充任该杂志的社长，总编辑是法国作家克罗德·摩尔岗，我国作家茅盾也是该杂志顾问之一。该刊创刊号已于六月出版，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会翻译的中文本也已出版。这是编辑得非常活泼有趣的一种杂志，值得大家都来阅读。
    创刊号的主要内容是关于两种制度和平共处的问题的讨论。除了皮尔·戈特所写的社论《两种制度和平共处与五大国公约》以外，参加这一讨论的尚有波兰国会外交委员会主席奥斯加·朗格，意大利基督民主党议员易吉诺·乔尔达尼，苏联作家爱伦堡，瑞典社会民主党议员勃兰亭，诺贝尔文学奖金获得者加贝里尔拉·米士特拉，比利时社会党议员布伦姆夫人，及我国中央人民政府副主席宋庆龄等许多人。他们的讨论都是从事实出发的，笔下充满了真挚的感情，因而文章很有感染力，读起来一点也不令人感觉枯燥。
    这一期还有好几篇通讯，这些通讯也是一些写得很有趣的文学作品，从它们里边可以看出全世界不管那里的人民都多么强烈地爱好和平，并根据他们过去已有的切身经验而极端憎恶帝国主义发动侵略战争的阴谋。
    该刊还有《奕棋》《体育》及《四大洲烹调法》三个小栏。这一期的《奕棋》栏发表了苏联的国际奕棋大圣手史米斯洛夫及巴诺夫的介绍苏联奕棋的文章，以后各期将连续刊载棋法及比赛消息等。《体育》栏报道了巴黎、意大利、匈牙利等地的体育活动。《四大洲烹调法》介绍了美国瓦棱西的闷饭等的做法。这些东西猛然看起来似乎是和“保卫和平共处”这样一个严肃的大问题不相关的一些琐事，但实际上这正是我们的和平生活的一些不可缺少的组成部分。爱好这样的和平生活的人，自然就要反对帝国主义的战争政策，反对嗜血的战争贩子们。把这些东西当作杂志的一部分内容，正足以生动地显示出世界人民爱好和平生活的意愿。
