　　Korean Culture Cannot Be Destroyed

　　The houses of countless schools in northern Korea have been destroyed by the "air superiority" of the American invading army, but the cultural life of the Korean people can never be destroyed.

　　After "August 15th," the education cause in northern Korea developed by leaps and bounds. For example, in Lianchuan, a small county town, there were seven middle schools. Today, the school buildings have been bombed into ruins by American planes, and even the rural primary schools located in remote mountain gullies are difficult to escape. Some thatched classrooms have been riddled with holes, and some have been burned to ashes. However, despite this, the American bandits' poisonous plot to turn Korea into a "desert" has failed; even in places not far from the front line, outstanding Korean sons and daughters are still persisting in the educational cause of spreading advanced human culture.

　　The areas of Ichon and Chorwon are the places where the American bandits have caused the most damage. Many teachers and students have resolutely joined the People's Army, while the teachers and students who remain continue to persevere in their posts under extremely difficult conditions. Under the leadership of the Korean People's Government, they merged several middle schools into a "People's Teacher Training Institute."

　　When the reporter entered this wartime school, although he could not see magnificent school buildings, flat sports fields, and libraries full of books, he saw the vigorous teaching life of teachers and students. Wooden signs for study rooms were hung at the entrances of a row of caves, which were also the dormitories for teachers and students. A large shelter was filled with tables and chairs, which was their classroom. Under a large tree were several tables and chairs with some books and newspapers on them, which was the principal's office and their library. The students were reading theoretical books and newspapers reporting the victories of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. The teachers and students of this school often dig up wild vegetables for meals, saving money to buy paper. They use American airplane machine gun bullet casings as ink bottles and pine soot as ink. They also engage in productive labor in their spare time, and have now planted 2,000 pyeong of rice, so that they can eat the fruits of their labor this autumn.

　　Although the "school buildings" of this school are temporary, their teaching is still regular. There are five classes every day, and the subjects studied include national language, geography, history, chemistry, algebra, educational practice, and political and current affairs studies. When the reporter visited them, it happened to be after class, but they did not rest, but seized this gap, sitting under a lush green shade of trees and in the grass, concentrating on listening to the teachers' explanations of current affairs. The teachers and students, who have been tempered by the war, fully realize the importance of their teaching tasks. Xu Zhenshu, who taught at the Chorwon Normal School with her husband before the war, her husband joined the People's Army when the war broke out, and she, like everyone else, harbored unparalleled hatred for the enemy. She said to the reporter: If the American bandits kill one of our teachers, we will train ten teachers. We want to let the flowers of Korean people's education bloom more brilliantly in the hard days of war! The reporter saw three other teachers leaning on crutches to attend classes, they were patients who had not yet recovered. Their mood was the same as that of the female teacher. Zhang Rongyu, a female student whose two older brothers had joined the People's Army, hoped to become a model people's teacher in the future.

　　The same is true in other parts of northern Korea. Countless Korean schools have been destroyed by American airplanes in crazy bombing, but countless schools have been rebuilt in the war. In these schools, thousands of teachers and students who hate the enemy, love their motherland, and love culture are being cultivated.

### 朝鲜的文化是摧毁不了的

　　朝鲜的文化是摧毁不了的
    新华社记者  王玉章
    朝鲜北部无数学校的屋舍被美国侵略军的“空军优势”所摧毁了，可是朝鲜人民的文化生活是永远不可摧毁的。
    在“八·一五”后，朝鲜北部的教育事业飞跃似地发展起来。譬如在涟川这座不大的县城里，就有七所中学。今天这些学校的校舍都已被美国飞机炸成了废墟，就连座落在偏僻的山沟里的乡村小学也难以幸免。几座茅草盖的课堂有的被打得七穿八洞，有的被烧成一片灰烬。但是，尽管如此，美国强盗要把朝鲜变成“沙漠”的毒谋还是失败了；即使在离前线不远的地方，优秀的朝鲜儿女们还是在坚持着传播人类先进文化的教育事业。
    伊川、铁原一带，是美国强盗破坏得最凶的地方。有许多教员和学生已毅然参加了人民军，而留下来的教师和学生们，就继续在极其坚苦的情况下，坚持自己的岗位。他们在朝鲜人民政府的领导下，把好几所中学合并成为一个“人民教员养成所”。
    当记者走进这一所战时学校时，虽然看不见巍峨的校舍，平坦的体育场和藏书累累的图书馆，但看到了师生们生气蓬勃的教学生活。在一排岩洞口上挂着自习室的木牌，这里也就是师生们的宿舍。在一个大的掩蔽部里摆满了桌椅，这就是他们的课堂。在一棵大树下有几张桌椅，上面放着一些书报，这就是校长的办公室和他们的图书馆。学生们正在那里阅读着理论书籍和刊登着朝、中人民军队捷报的报纸。这个学校的师生们经常挖些野菜下饭，省下钱来买纸张。他们用美国飞机的机枪子弹壳作墨水瓶，用松烟作墨水。他们并且利用课余时间从事生产劳动，现在已经种上了两千坪的稻子，今年秋收时就可以吃上自己的劳动果实了。
    这个学校的“校舍”虽然是临时性的，可是他们的教学还是正规的。每天有五堂课，学习的科目有国文、地理、历史、化学、代数、教育实习和政治、时事学习等。记者访问他们时，正碰上下课，但他们没有休息，而抓住这一空隙，坐在一片翠绿的树荫下与草丛中聚精会神地听教师们讲解时事。经过了战争锻炼的教员和学生，都充分认识到自己教学任务的重大。战前同丈夫一起在铁原师范教书的许贞淑，她的丈夫已在战争爆发时参加人民军，她跟所有的人一样，怀着对敌人的无比仇恨。她这样对记者说：美国强盗杀死我们一个教员，我们就要培养出十个教员。我们要让朝鲜人民教育的花朵在艰苦的战争日子里开得更灿烂！记者看到另外三个教员扶着拐杖上课，他们是尚未痊愈的病人。他们的心情是跟那位女教员一样的。另一位两个哥哥都参加了人民军的女学生张荣玉，希望自己将来做一个模范人民教员。
    朝鲜北部其他地方也都是这样，无数个朝鲜学校在美国飞机狂炸下毁灭了，可是无数学校又在战争中重建起来。在这些学校里正培养着千万个仇恨敌人热爱祖国热爱文化的教员和学生。
