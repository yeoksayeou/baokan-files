　　Further Improve National Budget Final Account Work
　　The Provisional Regulations on National Budget Final Accounts have been officially promulgated by the Government Administration Council. These regulations stipulate the procedures, scope, and powers of governments at all levels and their subordinate organs in compiling and reviewing budgets and final accounts; they also stipulate that if governments at all levels and their subordinate organs fail to compile budgets and final accounts on time, the financial organs may refuse to allocate funds or suspend their next installment of funds. These regulations will not only play a significant role in strengthening unified financial management and decentralized responsibility, but will also have a positive effect on promoting national economic and cultural construction. This is a further development of our national financial management system and a major administrative measure recently decided by our Central People's Government.
　　Over the past year, governments at all levels have shown great achievements in implementing the budget and final account system. The vast majority of government organs have been able to submit budgets and final accounts as required. The phenomenon of not submitting budgets has been greatly reduced. Taking the compilation of the general final accounts of governments and organs at all levels in 1950 as an example, all major administrative regions and provinces and cities had submitted them to the central government by late July. Provinces and cities such as Pingyuan and Beijing submitted them to the Central Ministry of Finance in March; except for a few units, the vast majority of central-level organs have submitted their annual final accounts to the Central Ministry of Finance, and some regions and departments, such as the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, the East China Military and Administrative Committee, and the Central Ministry of Railways, have compiled relatively good final accounts. Most of the local people's governments, financial organs, and enterprise departments, after the final accounts were completed, have paid attention to the financial management of enterprises, and they have realized the significant role of financial supervision in promoting the planning of construction work. For example, the year-end surplus of funds in 1950 was originally estimated to be over 1,500 billion yuan nationwide, but after preliminary statistics from the final accounts, it reached over 2,000 billion yuan. Some enterprise departments, due to the re-assessment of profits after implementing final accounts, exceeded the original planned profits by more than two times. Also, in terms of investment, some inappropriate expenditures and unnecessary losses were discovered due to the final accounts. This shows that the financial budget and final account system is a very important task for our national construction plan and financial management.
　　However, it must be pointed out that, up to now, some staff members of some organs still do not have a sufficient understanding of the budget and final account system. They often ask the financial organs for money without going through budget procedures, and if they are refused, they think that this is making things difficult for them. Some organs and departments no longer submit expense accounts to the financial departments after receiving the funds; some spend the funds they receive outside the scope of their planned expenditure, but make other expenditures instead, and some even use funds for operating expenses to purchase cars and furniture; individual organs and enterprise departments also have the phenomenon of spending first and then requesting reimbursement, and some enterprise departments also add construction costs to the cost and increase the sales price. All of the above are contrary to the requirements of our national budget and final account system. The reasons for this phenomenon are mainly that the following three incorrect understandings still exist among some staff members:
　　First, they believe that the task is urgent and the situation changes greatly, so there is no time to compile a budget, and therefore they think that there is no need to make this requirement too strict. Yes, in our work, in some special issues, there are situations where there is no time to compile a budget according to the regulations. However, this type of situation is very rare and should not be used as an excuse to violate the budget system. We know that for any project appropriation or operating expense expenditure, a budget should and must be compiled in advance in its project construction plan and business plan; only in this way can there be good engineering design and the project can be carried out step by step. Otherwise, if a budget is not compiled in advance, and an appropriation is demanded in an emergency, it will inevitably cause confusion and loss. According to the provisions of the pre-final account regulations promulgated this time, the requirements for the budget and final account compilation time and compilation procedures are very broad; Article 19 of Chapter 3 of the regulations stipulates: "If the budget has not been established at the beginning of the year,... the expenses of each organ may be borrowed according to the budget payment amount in December of the previous year." Article 28 of Chapter 4 stipulates: "If the income and expenditure situation is special and monthly accounting cannot be compiled, with the consent of the financial organ at the same level, quarterly accounting may be compiled." Obviously, this takes into account the actual situation. Under the circumstances that some special circumstances have been taken care of, if the spending organ still does not compile a budget or final account, this is an irresponsible attitude towards the country, and the financial organ should unreservedly implement the regulations of refusing to allocate funds and suspending the next installment of funds.
　　Second, some people think that the pre-final account system is a kind of restraint, and they advocate that only political guarantees are needed. These comrades do not understand the essence of the revolutionary system. The system is for restraint, and only relying on the restraint of the revolutionary system can there be a standard for testing the work. Is it possible to arbitrarily order large plans and ask for large sums of funds without considering the overall financial, material, and human resources? Obviously not. If this practice is approved, it will cause a great waste of financial, material, and human resources, and will make the country's entire construction fall into a state of no planning. Of course, we need political guarantees for all our work, but political guarantees are not empty words, but must have specific content. Only empty political guarantees, without organization, without work order, will lead to chaos in the work. Therefore, the specific performance of a politically strong person in financial work is to conscientiously implement the national financial system. The "political guarantee" that does not require a system itself violates the principles of politics.
　　Third, some people believe that the higher-ups are lenient and take care of the actual situation, while the lower-levels are strict and the procedures are cumbersome. Therefore, they often directly ask senior responsible comrades to approve slips for receiving funds without going through the budget preparation procedures. Although this phenomenon is not serious at present, it is not completely absent. It should be pointed out that this phenomenon is very harmful to the establishment of a regularized national system. Because the implementation of the national financial system not only requires the staff who specifically implement the system to do it, but also mainly relies on the adherence of senior responsible cadres. Some lower-level staff members may sometimes overemphasize the system, but the way to correct it should be to let them do more investigation, more research, and start more from reality, but they must never replace or abandon the commonly observed system with the irregular method of approving slips, which will only make things worse. Last year, the funds arbitrarily approved by senior responsible cadres in some places accounted for about 5% of the total budget of the region, which caused great difficulties in the annual final accounts, and the financial department was unable to control income and expenditure, thus forming a very passive situation in the work of the government in the region. Originally, budget review is a serious task, which not only relates to the country's financial plan, but also relates to the country's construction plan. For such a serious task, it should be serious and meticulous. We should resolutely oppose the practice of replacing budget review with a simple method of approving slips.
　　Our country is entering a period of economic recovery and development and consolidating national defense. Strengthening the country's financial planning is an indispensable and important task. After the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations on Budget Final Accounts, there must also be a series of organizational work and regular inspection work. Strict struggle should be launched against all phenomena that violate the financial system. Lenin said at the All-Russia Finance Conference in May 1918: "Do not forget that if we do not achieve success in financial policy, any thorough reforms we make are bound to fail. The success or failure of the great cause of socialist social transformation that we are planning depends on this." This lesson is worth our deep understanding.

### 把国家预算决算工作提高一步

　　把国家预算决算工作提高一步
    国家预算决算暂行条例，业经政务院正式公布了。这个条例，规定了各级人民政府及其所属机关之编造审核预算决算的程序、范围和职权；规定了各级人民政府及其所属机关如不按时编造预算决算，财政机关得拒绝拨款或停发其下期经费。这个条例不仅在加强财政统一管理和分级负责方面有重大的作用，而且在促进国家经济文化建设上，也将发生积极的效果。这是我们国家财政管理制度进一步的发展，也是我们中央人民政府最近决定的一个重大行政措施。
    一年多来，各级人民政府在贯彻执行预算决算的制度上，表现了很大成绩，绝大多数的政府机关已能按规定编送预算和编报决算。不送预算的现象已大大减少。仅就一九五○年度各级人民政府和各机关的总决算编造来看，各大行政区和省市迄七月下旬，均已全部送到中央，平原北京等省市三月份就送到中央财政部；中央一级除少数单位外，绝大多数的机关，已把年度决算送到中央财政部，而且有些地区和部门，如西南军政委员会、华东军政委员会和中央铁道部的决算是编得比较好的。大多数的地方人民政府、财政机关和企业部门，经过决算后，已引起对企业财务管理的注意，他们认识到财政监督对于促进建设工作的计划性方面的重大作用。例如，一九五零年经费的年终节余，原估计全国有一万五千余亿元，经过决算初步统计，已达二万数千亿元。某些企业部门，由于实行决算重新核定了利润，结果超过原定计划利润达二倍以上。又如，在投资方面，也因决算发现了好些不适当的开支，以及不应有的损失。这说明了财政的预算决算制度，对我们国家建设计划和财政管理，是一件很重要的工作。
    但必须指出，直到目前为止，还有一些机关的工作人员，对预算决算制度，认识不够。他们往往不经过预算手续，伸手就向财政机关要钱，如果受到拒绝就认为这是和他们为难。有的机关部门在领款之后，不再向财政部门报销；有的是把领去的款项，不在自己规定的计划范围内开支，而是做了其他的支出，甚至还有把事业费款项，购买了汽车家具；个别机关和企业部门还有先开支然后要求报销的现象，有些企业部门还有在成本上另外摊加建设费用，增大推销价格的。以上种种都是和我们国家预决算制度的要求相反的。产生这种现象的原因，主要是在某些工作人员中间还存在有以下三种不正确的认识：
    第一，他们认为任务紧急，情况变化很大，来不及编造预算，因而认为不必太过严格地作此要求。是的，在我们工作中，在某些特殊问题上，是有来不及按规定编造预算的情况。但这类情况是很少的，不应拿来做为违反预算制度的借口。我们知道，任何一项工程拨款或事业费开支，在其工程建设计划和事业计划上，是应该而且必须事先编造预算的；只有这样，才能有好的工程设计，才能有步骤地进行工程，否则，事前不编造预算，到了紧急时候硬要拨款，必然造成混乱和损失。根据这次颁布的预决算条例的规定，对于预决算编造时间和编制程序上的要求，都是很宽的；条例第三章第十九条所规定：“如在年度开始，预算尚未成立，……各机关之经费，得按照上年度十二月份预算支付数借支。”第四章第二十八条规定：“如收支情况特殊，不能按月编报月份计算者，经同级财政机关之同意，得按季编造季度计算。”显而易见，这是照顾到实际情况的，在某些特殊情况已有照顾的情形下，而开支机关仍然不编造预算，编制决算，这就是对国家不负责任的态度，财政机关即应毫不留情地执行拒绝拨款和停拨下期经费的规定。
    第二、有些人认为预决算制度是一种束缚，他们主张只要政治保证就行。这些同志不了解革命制度的本质。制度就是为了约束的，只有依靠革命制度的约束，工作才有检验的标准。可以不可以不考虑全面财力、物力、人力，随意订大计划，要大宗的经费呢？显然是不可以的。如果批准这种做法，就会造成财力、物力、人力的大浪费，就会使国家的整个建设陷于无计划的状态。我们进行各项工作，固然需要有政治保证，但政治保证不是空话，而要有具体内容。只有空喊的政治保证，不要组织，不要工作秩序，就会招致工作的混乱。所以一个政治上坚强的人，他在财政工作上的具体表现，就是认真贯彻国家的财政制度。不要制度的“政治保证”，本身就违反政治的原则。
    第三，有些人认为，上边宽，照顾实际；下边紧，手续烦琐，因之往往不经编造预算手续，即直接要求高级负责同志批条子领款。这种现象，虽在目前不算严重，但也不是完全没有。应该指出，这种现象，对于建立正规化的国家制度，是有很大妨害的。因为贯彻执行国家的财政制度，不仅要具体执行制度的工作人员去做，主要的还要靠高级负责干部的坚持。某些下级工作人员有时会有过分强调制度的一面，但改正的办法，应该是让他们多调查，多研究，多从实际出发，但决不能以不正规的批条子的办法来替代或废弃共同遵守的制度，这样就反而会治丝愈乱。去年某些地方的高级负责干部，随意批条子开支的款项，竟达该区总预算的百分之五左右，以致年度决算时感到很大困难，财政上亦无法掌握收支，因而形成该区政府工作上十分被动的局面。本来审核预算是一个严肃的工作，它不仅关系国家的财政计划，而且也关系国家的建设计划，对这样的严肃的工作，应该是认真的，丝毫不苟的。我们应该坚决反对那种以简单的批条子方式，代替预算审核的作法。
    我们国家正在进入恢复和发展经济与巩固国防的时期，加强国家的财政计划性，是一项必不可少的重要任务。预算决算暂行条例颁布以后，还必须有一系列的组织工作与经常的检查工作，对一切违反财政制度的现象，应展开严格的斗争。列宁在一九一八年五月全俄财政会议上讲过：“不要忘记，假如我们在财政政策方面没有成绩，我们任何彻底的改革，都必然要失败。我们所计划的社会主义的社会改造的伟大事业的成败，实系于此。”这个教训，值得我们深刻体会。
