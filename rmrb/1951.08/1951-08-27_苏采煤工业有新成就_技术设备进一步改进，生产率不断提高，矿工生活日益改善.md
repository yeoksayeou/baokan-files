　　New Achievements in Soviet Coal Mining Industry
    Further Improvements in Technology and Equipment, Continuous Increase in Productivity, and Daily Improvement in Miners' Lives
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th] According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow: The 26th is Soviet Miner's Day. On the eve of the festival, the Soviet Minister of Coal Industry, Zasyadko, told TASS reporters about the achievements of the Soviet coal industry: Soviet coal miners have completed 100.3 percent of this year's first half production plan. The coal output of the Donets and Eastern coal regions has greatly increased compared to pre-war levels, and the output of the Moscow coal region has increased several times. The technical equipment of the Soviet coal industry is the best in the world. Now, coal mining, coal cutting, tunnel transportation, and coal loading have been fully mechanized. Remote control has been implemented for various machines and equipment in the mines. This allows thousands of miners to have ample time to gradually improve their production technology. In the past two years, the productivity of coal mining combines has increased by nearly 60 percent. This machine can also be used to mine 60-centimeter thin coal seams and steep coal seams. In order to make fuller use of powerful coal mining equipment, Soviet coal mining areas have gradually and universally adopted a more advanced form of labor organization—a one-day-one-cycle production system, which has greatly increased production. For example, more than 40 percent of coal mines in the Donets coal region have adopted this system, which has increased coal production by nearly 40 percent, increased labor productivity by more than 20 percent, and greatly reduced production costs.
    Zasyadko then pointed out: The Soviet government attaches great importance to the labor of miners. More than 200 engineers, designers, and coal miners in the coal industry sector have won the Stalin Prize, 150 advanced workers have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, and more than 95,000 miners have received various medals and awards for their outstanding achievements over the years. Since 1947, the Soviet government has allocated 3 billion rubles as service allowances for miners. The living conditions of miners are constantly improving. During the post-war five-year plan, the state built apartment houses with a ground area of 6.5 million square meters for miners. Miners in various places have also received long-term loans from the state and built 73,000 private houses. The Soviet mining cities and residential areas have nearly 700 cultural palaces and clubs, more than 250 cultural and recreational parks, 580 cinemas, and 830 libraries with millions of books. In order to improve the medical equipment for miners, 23 hospitals, 15 clinics, and 53 pharmacies were opened between 1949 and 1950 alone. This year, tens of thousands of miners have been recuperating in resort areas, and 140,000 miners' children have spent their summer vacation in 256 Young Pioneer camps. Nine hundred and ten kindergartens accommodate more than 50,000 miners' children.
    Zasyadko concluded by saying: Soviet coal miners are actively putting forward socialist production guarantees to celebrate their festival. They have decided to overproduce hundreds of thousands of tons of coal before the end of this year, further improve the level of mechanization of work, improve the organization of labor, and accelerate capital construction. They deeply know that producing one ton of coal more than planned will contribute more to the cause of world peace.

### 苏采煤工业有新成就  技术设备进一步改进，生产率不断提高，矿工生活日益改善

　　苏采煤工业有新成就
    技术设备进一步改进，生产率不断提高，矿工生活日益改善
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十六日是苏联矿工节。苏联煤业部长扎霞迪科在节日前夕，对塔斯社记者谈苏联煤业的成就说：苏联采煤工人已完成了今年上半年生产计划的百分之一○○点三。顿尼兹和东部煤区的煤产量已比战前大为增加，莫斯科煤区的产量增加了数倍。苏联煤业的技术设备居于世界的首位。现在，掘煤、切煤、坑道运煤、煤炭装车等工作已充分机械化。矿场的各种机器和设备已实行了远距离的操纵。这就使得成千上万的矿工有充分的时间去逐步提高生产技术。两年来，采煤联合机的生产率差不多提高了百分之六十。这种机器还可以用来挖掘六十公分的薄煤层和陡峭煤层。为了更充分地使用强大的采煤设备，苏联各煤矿区已逐渐普遍地采用了更高级的劳动组织形式——一昼夜一循环的生产制度，生产量已大为增加。例如，顿尼兹煤区就有百分之四十以上的煤场采用了这种制度，煤产量差不多增加了百分之四十，劳动生产率提高了百分之二十以上，生产成本已大大地降低。
    扎霞迪科接着指出：苏联政府非常重视矿工的劳动。煤业部门有二百多个工程师、设计师和采煤工人荣获斯大林奖金，一百五十个先进工人荣膺社会主义劳动英雄的称号，九万五千多个矿工由于多年来成绩卓著获得了各种勋章和奖章。一九四七年以来，苏联政府已拨了三十亿卢布作为矿工的服务津贴。矿工的生活条件正在不断改善着，在战后五年计划期间，国家共为矿工建造了地面面积六百五十万平方公尺的公寓房屋。各地矿工还得到国家的长期贷款，建筑了七万三千幢私人住宅。苏联的矿工城市和居民区共有将近七百座文化宫与俱乐部、二百五十多个文化与休息公园、五百八十间电影院和藏书数百万册的八百三十所图书馆。为了改善矿工的医疗设备，仅在一九四九年到一九五○年间，就开设了二十三所医院、十五所诊疗所和五十三间药房。今年已有数万矿工在休养地区休养，十四万矿工子弟在二百五十六个少年先锋营过暑假。九百一十所幼稚园收容着五万多矿工儿童。
    扎霞迪科最后说：苏联煤业工人为了庆祝他们的节日，正纷纷提出社会主义的生产保证。他们已决定在今年年底以前超计划生产数十万吨煤，并进一步提高工作机械化水平，改善劳动的组织和加速进行基本建设。他们深深地知道，超计划多生产一吨煤，就对世界和平事业多一分贡献。
