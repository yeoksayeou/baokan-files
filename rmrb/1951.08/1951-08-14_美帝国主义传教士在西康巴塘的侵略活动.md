　　The Aggressive Activities of American Imperialist Missionaries in Batang, Xikang
    Chuan Fang, Xin Ke
    Batang has always been the political, economic, and cultural center of Central and Southern Xikang. Imperialism attempted to use it as one of the bases for invading the Xikang-Tibetan Plateau. As early as 1903, two French priests, under the orders of the Vatican and the French government, entered Batang and forcibly purchased dozens of acres of land, intending to begin their aggression. However, their barbaric behavior angered the people of Batang, and they were driven out.

    In 1904, just as British imperialism dispatched an invasion force led by Younghusband to capture Lhasa, Tibet, American imperialist pawns, the pastors Ogden and Shelter, arrived in Batang. They carried an official document from Zhao Erfeng, the Sichuan Governor-General of the Qing government, to Wang Lingde, the Batang military grain administrator. This document ordered the transfer of 55 acres of land on the north bank of the Batang River to the two pastors for "missionary" purposes. Thirsting for this land, American imperialism extended its pig snout into the garden of the Xikang-Tibetan Plateau through the corrupt ruling class of the Qing Dynasty. The American pastors forcibly occupied this Chinese territory for an annual rent of 170 Tibetan silver dollars (each Tibetan silver dollar is currently worth about 700 RMB) and a term of 39 years. The pastors built 20 houses on this Chinese territory, surrounded by high walls, neither paying taxes nor subject to the jurisdiction of Chinese government laws, resembling a "concession." After the American pastors gained a foothold in Batang, they seized another 104 acres of land through trickery and coercion within a few years, becoming the largest landowners in Batang. The aggressive forces of American imperialism thus continued to expand. More than 30 American pastors, including Duncan, Bellew, Peterson, and McLeod, came to Batang one after another. These envoys from the "gold dollar empire" across the Pacific were dispersed to the countryside to "preach" and "practice medicine." But their hypocrisy could not deceive the people of Batang. An old leather worker, Ge Rangaxi, said that he had seen this group of American pastors and imperialists from other countries organize "alpine expeditions" or "tour groups" several times, going around surveying and mapping, some going to Qinghai, and some crossing the Jinsha River to the remote mountains of the Ningjing Mountains. It is very obvious that this group of imperialists was carrying out aggressive activities under the guise of "preaching." A church member, Xie Fuhou, said that after the American pastor Duncan returned to the United States in 1935, he became an advisor to the U.S. Department of the Army for the study of Tibetan issues. After the end of World War II, he followed MacArthur to Tokyo and helped MacArthur formulate policies for the invasion of the Far East.

    Men and women over the age of 50 in Batang deeply remember the disasters inflicted on them by the American missionary Ogden. In April 1920, a group of foreign bandits attacked Batang. The people of Batang rose up to defend themselves and bravely repelled the invaders. The American imperialist Ogden was afraid that the strength of the people of Batang would grow, so he incited the brutal Batang warlord commander Yang Dexi to massacre the people. The warlord, following his instructions, immediately ordered the army to fire on the people, resulting in the deaths of seven innocent people, the burning of 68 houses, and the looting of property of the entire city. The people of Batang will never forget this unprecedented tragedy directed by this American imperialist.

    This American pastor also openly interfered in China's internal affairs. In 1918, Ogden, "representing" the Sichuan warlords, participated in the "Ningjing Treaty" negotiations between the Lhasa authorities and the Sichuan army. Also participating in this negotiation was the British Deputy Consul in Ningjing, Densiman. A British diplomat and an American pastor "mediated" the internal strife of the Chinese local authorities into a diplomatic dispute between the two countries, and signed thirteen "peace agreements," dividing the counties of Western Xikang west of the Jinsha River into the Tibetan region.

    During the American economic depression in 1932, the American pastors in Batang returned to their country one after another. A few years later, many new pastors came. Among them, Pastor Baker from California brought a pistol, a two-way radio transceiver, and a radio. He had "close friendship" with the British spy Ford in Qamdo and often went to Qamdo for "travel."

    When the People's Liberation Army liberated the Sichuan area, and the underground fire of the Batang people welcoming liberation was burning fiercely, this group of American imperialists hurriedly fled Batang, which they had operated for 40 years. Pastor Baker abandoned the apple trees in the "concession" and fled to India with two small bags of gold. In a letter he sent to Ford on March 13, 1950, he was full of hostility towards the Chinese people. He wrote: "A few days before we left Ba'an, the Communist youth (referring to the Eastern Tibet Democratic Youth League) searched my house and confiscated the radio. They declared that they would march into Lhasa and take over Tibet. I pray to God that they will not succeed!" The British pastor Bell, a faithful lackey of American imperialism, attempted to incite the Tibetan army after fleeing Batang, but he was captured by the uprising Tibetan army and handed over to the People's Liberation Army.

    After this group of American imperialists fled to India, they did not give up and still dreamed of making a comeback. Last November, Christians in Batang received a letter from the American imperialist Baker from West Sisar, India. He shamelessly said: "If the situation improves quickly, we will be able to return to Tibet."

    However, the dreams of American imperialist elements like Baker cannot be realized. The Tibetan people, who have suffered from imperialist oppression, have stood up and returned to the embrace of the great motherland. They will never allow foreign aggressors to extend their claws into our sacred territory again.

### 美帝国主义传教士在西康巴塘的侵略活动

　　美帝国主义传教士在西康巴塘的侵略活动
    传方　辛可
    巴塘一向是康中和康南的政治、经济、文化中心，帝国主义企图把它当作侵略康藏高原的基地之一。早在一九○三年，便有两个法国神父奉梵蒂冈和法国政府的命令进入巴塘，在巴塘强买了几十亩土地，想开始他们的侵略活动。但是他们的蛮横行为激怒了巴塘人民，被巴塘人民驱逐出来。
    一九○四年，正当英帝国主义派遣荣赫鹏率领侵略军攻陷西藏拉萨时，美帝国主义的爪牙、牧师奥格登和晓尔腾来到了巴塘。他们带着满清政府的四川总督赵尔丰给巴塘军粮府王令得的公文，这个公文命令把巴塘河南岸架炮顶的五十五亩土地交给两个牧师作“传教”之用。垂涎万分的美帝国主义便这样通过腐败的满清统治阶级，将它的猪鼻子伸进了康藏高原的花园。美国牧师们以年租一百七十个藏洋（每个藏洋现约值人民币七百元）和三十九年的期限强占了这块中国领土。牧师们在这块中国领土上造起二十间房子，四周筑起高大的围墙，既不完粮纳税，也不受中国政府法令的管辖，俨然像“租界”一样。美国牧师在巴塘站稳后，几年之间又巧取豪夺地霸占了一百零四亩土地，成为巴塘最大的地主。美帝国主义的侵略势力就这样不断地扩大，先后来到巴塘的美国牧师有邓肯、贝尔义、皮德生、麦克劳德等三十多人。这些远自太平洋彼岸的“金圆帝国”来的使者，都分散到四乡去“传教”和“行医”。但是他们的伪善是骗不过巴塘人民的眼睛的。老皮革工人格让阿西说：他曾几次看到这批美国牧师和其他国家的帝国主义分子组织什么“高山探险队”或“旅行团”，四出调查测绘地图，有的上青海去，也有的渡过金沙江到宁静山脉的荒山里去。这批帝国主义分子以“传教”为名进行侵略活动，是十分明显的了。教徒谢副候说：美国牧师邓肯于一九三五年回到美国以后，便当了美国陆军部研究西藏问题的顾问。第二次世界大战结束以后，他又随麦克阿瑟到达东京，帮助麦克阿瑟制订侵略远东的政策。
    巴塘五十岁以上的男女都深深地记着美国传教士奥格登给予他们的灾难。一九二零年四月间，有一股外来土匪进攻巴塘，巴塘人民起而自卫，奋勇击退了侵犯者。美帝国主义分子奥格登害怕巴塘人民的力量壮大起来，于是他便教唆残暴的巴塘军阀统领杨德锡残杀人民。这个军阀照着他的吩咐，立即命令军队向人民开火，结果七个无辜人民被杀死，六十八间民房被烧毁，全城人民财物被抢一空。巴塘人民永远忘不了这个美帝国主义分子所导演的空前惨剧。
    这个美国牧师还曾经公开地干涉中国内政。一九一八年，奥格登“代表”四川军阀，参加了拉萨当局与川军之间的“宁静条约”的谈判，参加这次谈判的还有英国驻宁静副领事邓西曼。一个英国外交官，一个美国牧师，把中国地方当局的内争“调解”成两国的外交纠纷，订了十三条“和议”，将金沙江以西的西康各县划归西藏地区。
    在一九三二年美国经济恐慌时期，巴塘的美国牧师相继归国。几年后，又有许多新牧师来到。其中，从加里福尼亚州来的培克牧师，还带来了一支手枪，一部收发报两用无线电机和一架收音机。他与昌都的英国间谍福特有着“密切的交谊”，时常到昌都去“旅行”。
    当人民解放军解放了四川地区，巴塘人民迎接解放的地下烈火熊熊地燃烧起来的时候，这批美帝国主义分子慌张地逃开了经营四十年的巴塘。培克牧师抛掉了“租界”内的苹果树，携带了两小袋黄金逃往印度。他在一九五○年三月十三日给福特的信中，充满了对于中国人民的敌意。他写着：“我们离开巴安前几天，共产党的青年（指东藏民主青年同盟）到我家搜查，并把无线电没收。他们大言要进军拉萨，接收西藏，我祈祷上帝愿他们做不到！”美帝国主义的忠实走狗、英国牧师贝尔在逃离巴塘以后，还企图去煽动藏军，但是他被起义的藏军捕获，交给了人民解放军。
    这批美帝国主义分子逃到印度以后，他们并没有死心，还幻想卷土重来。去年十一月间，巴塘的基督教徒收到美帝国主义分子培克从印度西萨寄来的信，他厚颜无耻地说：“假如情况很快好转，我们就能回到西藏来了。”
    可是，培克之流的美帝国主义分子的梦想是无法实现的。受尽帝国主义压迫的藏族人民已经站了起来，回到伟大祖国的怀抱里来，他们将永远不会容许外国侵略分子再把他们的蹄爪伸进我们神圣的国土。
