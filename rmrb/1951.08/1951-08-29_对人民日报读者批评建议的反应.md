Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to the People's Daily

    Explanation of the Renovation of Substandard Water Conservancy Projects by the Water Conservancy Engineering Office of Xuancheng Prefecture, Southern Anhui
    To the Editor:
    We have read the letter from comrades Ma Zijiu and two others published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on June 19, criticizing that "many water conservancy projects in Xuancheng Prefecture, Southern Anhui, are substandard." We now explain the facts as follows: In the winter of last year and the spring of this year, Xuancheng Prefecture, in conjunction with the mass movements of land reform and resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, launched large-scale construction and repair of dikes, ponds, dams, culverts, revetments, and other water conservancy projects in various places, based on mobilizing and relying on the masses. Through the concerted efforts of cadres at all levels and the masses, overcoming various difficulties in material and natural conditions, the planned progress of all projects was basically completed. A total of more than 3,460,000 workdays were mobilized, 110 dikes and embankments were repaired, totaling 1,266 kilometers in length, and 4,275,500 cubic meters of earthwork were completed. In addition, 22,561 large and small ponds and dams were built, benefiting more than 1,131,000 mu of farmland. However, due to the lack of technical cadres, and the fact that leading cadres in individual areas relaxed supervision and inspection of water conservancy projects due to the heavy task of land reform, some projects were of substandard quality. At the end of April, the Prefectural Water Conservancy Engineering Office dispatched a working group to cooperate with the Southern Anhui Water Conservancy Bureau to conduct focused inspections and acceptance in various counties, and promptly urged the local leading cadres to mobilize the masses to carry out repairs and renovations for individual substandard projects. From June 17 to 29, the Xiongbao section of the Yijiang dike in Nanling mobilized 3,243 laborers in 12 days, completed more than 2,700 cubic meters of repair earthwork, added more than 300 soil bulls, and built more than 300 meters of clay-covered embankments, two-thirds of a meter wide, outside the original dike slope foot to ensure that the dike foot would not seep or collapse. The Taifeng dike began renovation in early June. Now all the large clods have been broken and compacted, the dangerous internal slopes have been built with earth supports and two platforms, and 671 soil bulls have been added. During heavy rains in late June, the Xialindu dike mobilized more than 4,000 laborers to the dike to reinforce the dangerous sections. Now each steep gate of the dike has 50 cubic meters of reserve soil piled up, and the dangerous sections have been filled with earth supports (each earth support has more than 200 cubic meters of soil), and more than 10,000 soil bulls have been piled up throughout the dike. Other dikes such as Shanglindu, Dongqilian, Xiqilian, and Silian basically completed renovation projects in early July, greatly improving the quality of the dike projects. Dikes in Xuancheng, Changxing, and Taibao were also repaired. After such repairs and renovations, the shortcomings of individual substandard sections of water conservancy projects throughout the region have been remedied.
    The opinions raised by Comrade Ma Zijiu and others in their letter to the People's Daily in mid-June were based on the shortcomings listed in the summary report of the spring work acceptance of the Prefectural Water Conservancy Engineering Office. They did not mention the plans for timely remediation, the completed repairs, or the overall quality of the project. We believe that this is a shortcoming of the original draft.

    Editor's Note: According to a letter from Comrade Ma Zijiu, the original draft was indeed written based on the acceptance report of the Water Conservancy Engineering Office of Xuancheng Prefecture at that time. He saw that the flood season had arrived and that repairing substandard water conservancy projects was a very important matter, so he only pointed out the substandard parts of the project, without introducing the completed repairs or the comprehensive situation of repairs that were being or would be carried out. On this point, we agree with the Water Conservancy Engineering Office that it is inappropriate not to introduce the completed repairs or the repairs that will be carried out.

    Self-Criticism for Neglecting Democratic Management and Labor Protection
    To the Editor:
    Regarding the criticism of the work of Tianjin Sanitary Material Factory and the serious shortcomings in myself published in the People's Daily on May 16, I now make the following self-criticism:
    It is true that democratization of factory management has not been done well enough, and the idea of relying on the working class to run the factory well is not clear. Only one staff and worker representative conference was held in 1951. Although the factory management committee has met several times, it has not been held on schedule. I have rarely gone deep into the lower levels and workshops. Although there are some objective reasons, there are problems with my thinking. For example, I think that we can complete the tasks without holding management committee meetings, and that holding management committee meetings is a waste of time. I think that our factory produces extremely different varieties, and the representatives of each workshop on the management committee do not understand each other's situations, and each department is in its own line, so it is difficult to discuss specific production issues. The above ideas are wrong and should be corrected in the future.
    When making decisions, I often start from subjective wishes. For example, the implementation of piece-rate wages in the glass department is a good system, and our starting point is also to improve production; but we lack investigation and research and do not understand that this system is not yet feasible at the time. In addition, I often insist on my own opinions at meetings, which is also dominated by conceited ideas.
    We do not care enough about the welfare of the workers. Although we have done some work in this area in the past two years, such as the construction of dormitories, the installation of tap water pipes, the renovation of old dormitories, and the expansion of the clinic; but we rarely consulted with the masses, and the bathhouse and large canteen urgently requested by the workers have not been resolved.
    Our administration has not provided enough assistance to the work of the trade union because I mistakenly believe that the trade union and the administration are opposed to each other, and that the trade union only adds some difficulties to the administration and does not help the administration solve any problems. Therefore, I have alienated the trade union. In the future, I should actively help the trade union to work so that everyone can be well united.

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    皖南宣城专署水利工程处
    对不合标准的水利工程翻修情况的说明编辑同志：
    六月十九日人民日报读者来信栏刊登的马子久等三同志批评皖南宣城专区“许多水利工程不合标准”的来信读到了，现将事实经过说明如下：宣城专区在去年冬季和今年春季结合土地改革与抗美援朝等群众运动，在发动群众依靠群众的基础上，对各地圩堤、塘坝、涵闸、护岸等水利工程，曾开展了规模巨大的兴建与补修。经各级干部与群众同心协力，克服了物质与自然条件上的种种困难，基本上完成了全部工程预订进度。先后共动员了三百四十六万多个工，修复了一百十处堤圩，全长一千二百六十六公里，完成土方四百二十七万五千余公方。另外，兴修大小塘坝共二万二千五百六十一处，受益田亩达一百一十三万一千余亩。但是由于技术干部的缺乏，及个别地区的领导干部因土地改革任务繁重，放松了对水利工程的督促检查，以致有一部分工程，质量不合标准。专署水利工程处在四月底即派出工作组配合皖南水利局赴各县作了有重点的检查验收，对个别不合标准的工程及时督促该地领导干部发动群众进行补修翻修。南陵弋江熊宝段圩堤，自六月十七日到二十九日，十二天内，动员民工三千二百四十三人，完成补修土方二千七百多方，增堆土牛三百多个，并在原堤坡脚外以粘土筑好包淤三百多公尺，宽达三分之二公尺，保证了堤脚不致渗漏倾坍。太丰圩自六月初开始翻修，现大土块已全部打碎砸实，险工内坡已筑好土撑和二台子，并增筑土牛六百七十一个。下林都圩在六月下旬下大雨期间，曾发动了四千多民工上堤培修了险工地段，现该圩各个陡门都堆好了五十公方预备土，险工地段都挑了土撑（每个土撑二百多方土），并在全圩堆好土牛一万多个。其他如上林都、东七连、西七连、四连等圩在七月初即已基本上完成翻修工程，大大提高了圩堤工程质量。宣城、长兴、太保等圩也同样进行了补修。全区各处水利工程，经过这样的补修翻修，个别地段工程不合标准的缺点，已得到了补救。
    马子久等同志六月中旬给人民日报的信中所提出的意见，是根据专署水利工程处春工验收总结报告中所列举的缺点而提出的，对于及时补救的计划、已补修的情况以及全面工程质量的情况都没有谈到，我们认为这是原稿的一个缺点。
          皖南宣城专署水利工程处  庞锡田、王奇
    编者按：据马子久同志来信说，原稿确系根据当时宣城专署水利工程处的验收报告写的，他当时看到汛期已至，补修不合标准的水利工程是一件很重要的事，所以只指出了工程中的不合标准处，而没有介绍已补修或正将补修等全面情况。对于这一点，我们同意水利工程处的意见，不介绍已补修或将补修的情况是不妥当的。
    天津卫生材料厂厂长段勋令
    对忽视民主管理与劳动保护的检讨编辑同志：
    人民日报五月十六日刊载批评天津卫生材料厂工作及本人存在严重缺点的事，现作如下的检讨：
    工厂管理民主化作得不够，依靠工人阶级办好工厂的思想不明确是确实的。一九五一年只召开了一次职工代表会，工厂管理委员会虽开过数次，但没有作到按期召开。深入下层与车间较少，客观上虽有些原因，但我的思想是有毛病的。如认为不开管委会也能完成任务，开管委会反而费时间；认为我们的工厂生产品种极不相同，管委会各车间代表彼此均不了解情况，各部各为一行，生产具体问题难以讨论；以上这些思想是错误的，今后应当改正。
    在决定事情时，常常从主观愿望出发。如玻璃部实行计件工资，这个制度是好的，我们出发点也是为搞好生产；但我们缺乏调查研究，不了解这个制度在当时还实行不通。另外如在会议上遇有问题，往往坚持己见，这也是自高自大的思想支配着自己。
    对工人的福利，我们是关心不够的。二年来在这方面虽然也作了一些工作，如宿舍的建筑、自来水管的安置、旧宿舍改修、诊疗所的扩充等；但很少与群众商量，工人迫切要求的澡塘及大的食堂均未解决。
    我厂行政上对工会工作帮助不够，原因是：我错误地认为工会与行政对立，工会只是给行政增加了些困难，没有帮助行政解决什么问题。因此，疏远了工会。今后应该积极地帮助工会工作，大家才能很好团结起来。
