Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 23rd—The sequence of events regarding the US aircraft bombing and strafing of the Kaesong conference site is as follows: At 10:20 PM on August 22nd, a US aircraft intruded into the airspace above the Kaesong conference site, circling at low altitude two or three times, and then dropped bombs. The bombs identified so far include: one incendiary bomb, which landed about two to three hundred meters from the conference venue and about eight hundred meters northeast of our delegation's residence, immediately igniting the sorghum in that area. Additionally, three bombs landed on a mountain about two hundred meters northwest of our delegation's residence. After dropping the bombs, the US aircraft also strafed the northern area of our delegation's residence with a burst of machine gun fire. This perfidious and shameless atrocity on the part of the United States has aroused great indignation among the members of our delegation, foreign and Chinese journalists in Kaesong, and the people of the Kaesong area. This incident is more serious than the provocative act of the US-Lee army invading the Kaesong neutral zone on August 19th and attacking our patrol team near Panmunjom. It also more clearly exposes the conspiracy of US imperialism to deliberately disrupt the Kaesong negotiations. Our side will lodge a serious protest regarding this incident.

　　美机轰炸扫射开城会址区经过
    【新华社开城二十三日电】美国飞机轰炸扫射开城会址区经过如下：二十二日晚十时二十分，美国飞机一架，侵入开城会址区上空，低空盘旋两三圈，随即投掷炸弹。已查明的炸弹有：汽油弹一枚，落于离会场约二三百米，离我方代表团住所东北约八百米地方，该地高粱当即着火燃烧。另炸弹三枚，落于离我方代表团住所西北约二百米山上。美国飞机在投弹后，又用机枪在我方代表团住所北方扫射子弹一梭。美国方面的这次背信弃义的无耻暴行，引起了我方代表团人员开城的中外记者和开城地区人民的极大愤慨。这次事件比八月十九日美李军侵入开城中立区，在板门店附近袭击我方巡逻队的挑衅行为，更为严重，也更清楚地暴露了美帝国主义蓄意破坏开城谈判的阴谋。我方即将就此事件提出严重抗议。
