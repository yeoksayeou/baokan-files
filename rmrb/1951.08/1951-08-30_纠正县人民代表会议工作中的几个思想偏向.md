　　Correcting Several Ideological Deviations in the Work of the County People's Representative Conference
    In preparation for convening county magistrate conferences, various places in North China are currently studying documents related to the construction of democratic government and reviewing their work in light of reality. Other parts of the country are also conducting similar studies and reviews, or are preparing to do so. This is absolutely necessary.
    Our New Democratic government, in the past, due to the limitations of historical conditions and the war environment, although its organizational form and democratic system were not yet very complete, in its democratic essence, it has always been the most advanced and democratic government in Chinese history. After the national liberation, our government construction has undergone new developments, especially the convening of people's representative conferences at all levels, which has yielded rich experience; the people have also made great creations and achievements in exercising state power, which cannot be ignored.
    However, in the process of our work's progress, we must constantly check and criticize any shortcomings and errors. Because we deeply understand that correctly carrying out criticism and self-criticism is the driving force for our work's progress; and political complacency and vulgar liberalism will stifle the progress of the revolutionary cause. At present, some places in North China that have not held county people's representative conferences well have already summarized their experiences, made preliminary reviews, and begun to recognize their shortcomings. This is good. In addition, some counties have held good people's representative conferences. However, there are still some places where the people's representative conferences were not held well, and no serious review has yet been conducted, which is not right. The leading organs and leading cadres in these places often excuse themselves by citing certain objective difficulties; they often only circle around superficial phenomena and minor issues; some put forward some seemingly correct but actually wrong reasons, hindering the essential recognition and review of major shortcomings. This phenomenon must continue to be corrected.
    What are the main ideological obstacles that have prevented some counties from holding good people's representative conferences?
    "There is too much central work, pressing too tightly, making us unable to take care of government construction (referring to holding good people's representative conferences)." This is one saying. This is a wrong statement that opposes people's representative conferences to other central work. Indeed, various tasks are very tense. Precisely because of this, it is even more necessary to discuss, deploy, promote, and complete various central tasks through the people's representative conferences. Whoever envisions that the people's representative conferences can not focus on handling central work, but are "holding people's representative conferences for the sake of holding people's representative conferences," then this is an erroneous idea that is divorced from reality and opposed to government work, and this idea has always been resolutely opposed by us. Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi instructed us: People's representative conferences at all levels "should be convened on schedule, and should be convened even more when 'there is too much work,' in order to mobilize more people and unite the activists among the people to do these so-called too much work separately." "We must make people's representative conferences at all levels become the central link in all work and all activities of the people's governments at all levels." (Speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing Municipality). Doesn't this clearly point out that the more central work there is, the more necessary it is to strengthen the role of the government; the more central work there is, the more substantial the content of the people's representative conferences should be, and the better they should be held? The good experiences of Jiyuan and Chaocheng in Pingyuan Province, and Yushe and Jincheng in Shanxi Province, which have been published in this newspaper recently, all prove that people's representative conferences can be held well completely through central work; and that when people's representative conferences are held well, central work can be completed more smoothly. Isn't this an ironclad fact?
    Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi also told us: "Some government workers are not very willing to convene people's representative conferences. They are accustomed to a few people doing everything, and are not accustomed to consulting with the people's representatives to handle affairs." This is the crux of the current problem. Some of our comrades are actually unwilling to convene or convene people's representative conferences on schedule, and are unwilling to seriously establish the basic system of the state. They do not understand that the people's representative conference is an organizational form and working method that is particularly conducive to promoting democracy in a guided manner and is not conducive to implementing all-inclusive arrangements; "doing everything" will definitely make it difficult to hold it well, and will make it "worse each time."
    "Holding cadre meetings can also complete tasks, and people's representative conferences are not as simple as cadre meetings." This sentence has some "truth." Our cadres are loyal servants of the people. Whether in terms of their contribution to the revolution or their level of consciousness, especially their spirit of selfless work, they are in no way inferior to the people's representatives. Cadres and people's representatives are both glorious, and there should be no discrimination against them. When the war was at its most difficult stage, and the environment we were in made it difficult to convene people's representative conferences frequently, we used the form of cadre meetings to complete various tasks. In that case, it was relatively simple. Even today, cadre meetings are still an important and indispensable form. It should not be generally said that cadre meetings and people's representative conferences, which one is important and which one is not. Cadre meetings are always necessary, and even with people's representative conferences, cadre meetings are still needed. However, no matter which aspect it is from, the opinion that cadre meetings are held and there is no need to hold people's representative conferences is completely wrong. Chairman Mao said: "All important work of the people's government should be submitted to the people's representative conference for discussion and decision." We must do this correctly, otherwise it is wrong. So, why do some of our comrades particularly emphasize cadre meetings and not emphasize people's representative conferences? Why do they actually turn some people's representative conferences into ordinary cadre meetings? Why do they actually change the nature of some people's representative conferences as organs of power? Here, although there are many objective reasons, the main reason is subjective, that is, some leading comrades are accustomed to the simplified working methods and old routines developed in the long and cruel war environment, and are accustomed to "I say and you obey," "deciding without discussion." Although these comrades are wholeheartedly serving the people as "long-term workers," they do not like the "master" to "issue orders," "criticize and supervise," and add "constraints" to them. They want to turn the people's representative conferences into ordinary cadre meetings in practice, which shows that they actually believe in their minds that state power belongs to the people conditionally, that government cadres do not listen to the people's representative organs, that is, the organs of power, and do not respect the authority of the people's representative conferences to exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress, but reduce the people's democratic power to the status of "leadership bestowing." It is true that, according to the organizational principle of democratic centralism, the people's government and the people's representative conference are an inseparable whole of the people's democratic government; the people's representatives are also cadres of the state and the people, and the people's government has every reason to require the people's representatives to assist the government in its work, and the people's representatives also have the obligation to accept the leadership of the government. However, the problem lies in simply giving tasks without respecting its power, not letting it solemnly discuss and decide on major issues, but only letting it implement the tasks given; even simply "using" the people's representatives without paying attention to promoting their political enthusiasm, thus weakening the people's representatives' sense of ownership; therefore, the people's representative organs simply become the government's assistants, neglecting their due powers. This is what we should resolutely oppose.
    "The affairs of the country are also the affairs of the people; wanting things is also for the people." This is another saying. That's right! Our country is the country of the people, and everything that the government "takes from the people" is still "used for the people," that is, for the people. But our leadership must be and can only be from the masses and back to the masses. It is absolutely necessary for the people's representative conferences to discuss state affairs and important matters related to the vital interests of all the people, such as production and taxation, and no one has any reason to oppose it. But since this is the case, can we do everything by command? No! When deploying state tasks, it is absolutely necessary to fully discuss and negotiate with the people's representatives, so that state affairs truly become the people's own affairs, and to adopt a democratic mass line leadership style. However, some comrades say that "there is not enough time and there is no time to negotiate." May I ask if there are really so many urgent matters that there is no time to negotiate? May I ask if fewer lengthy reports can be made at the meeting so that everyone has more time to negotiate and deliberate? Some leading comrades lack sufficient ideological leadership and political leadership in handling state affairs, and have not adopted the mass line. They do not care about the common and specific requirements of the people's daily lives, and oppose state affairs to the affairs of the people. This is obviously wrong. One of the main shortcomings of many county people's representative conferences at present is that they do not care about the people's daily lives and are indifferent to handling the people's own affairs, so that the number of proposals from the people is decreasing day by day in many counties. Some of this decrease has reasonable reasons. For example, if the village and district people's representative conferences are sound, the minor problems at the county people's representative conferences will naturally decrease; some prominent problems have been solved, and some demands and opinions of the masses have been correctly concentrated by the leadership, so the proposals will naturally decrease; or the central work such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries is particularly prominent, and other matters will be diluted. However, in many places at present, the decrease in proposals is not due to these reasons. The main reason is still that the leadership is irresponsible and perfunctory in handling proposals, which makes the people and their representatives feel that "speaking is useless," thus seriously affecting their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for the people's representative conferences. This is a serious defect that cannot be ignored.
    "Only afraid of criticism from above, not afraid of complaints from below." This idea certainly has its objective historical reasons, but the main reason is that cadres do not understand the unity of being responsible to the leading organs and directly responsible to the people. And some comrades are arrogant and meritorious, thinking that "we fought the world" and "we can do everything." Therefore, they do not respect the people's representatives. In some villages, cadres and representatives compare qualifications and merits. Some cadres are very dissatisfied and say: "Whoever wears the red strip, whoever eats the steamed bun, whoever goes to work." This kind of thinking is reflected in the work of the people's representative conferences, and it often leads to excessively high conditions for the people's representatives, and they take care of the results of the representative elections on behalf of the people because they are "afraid of being impure"; they are not good at uniting people from all walks of life to carry out work together. As for the people's representatives, if any are found to be incompetent, the people should replace them at any time, which is completely right.
    The existence of current ideological deviations is the real reason why many county people's representative conferences are not held well. Therefore, to strengthen the construction of the people's democratic government, to improve the people's representative conferences and improve the leadership of the people's governments at all levels, we must carry out an irreconcilable struggle against these erroneous ideological deviations, so that the people's representative conferences truly become the fundamental system of our country.

### 纠正县人民代表会议工作中的几个思想偏向

　　纠正县人民代表会议工作中的几个思想偏向
    华北各地为准备召开县长会议，目前正在学习有关民主政权建设的文件，联系实际，检查工作。全国其他地方，也有同样进行学习和检讨的，有的正在准备这样做。这是十分必需的。
    我们新民主主义的政权，在过去时期，由于历史条件和战争环境的限制，它的组织形式和民主制度虽然还不很完备，但在民主实质上，它从来就是中国历史上最先进最民主的政权。全国解放后，我们的政权建设有了新的发展，特别是召开各级人民代表会议，已有丰富的经验；人民群众在行使国家政权中也有了伟大的创造和成就，这些都是不能忽视的。
    但是，我们在工作前进的过程中，对于任何缺点和错误，必须随时加以检查和批评。因为我们深深懂得正确地开展批评和自我批评是我们工作前进的动力；而政治上的麻痹自满情绪和庸俗的自由主义倾向是会窒息革命事业的前进的。目前，华北的一些没有开好县人民代表会议的地方，有的已经总结了经验，初步地进行了检讨，开始认识自己的缺点。这是好的。另外有一些县的人民代表会议是开得好的。可是，还有些地方，人民代表会议既开得不好，又还没有认真检讨，这是不对的。这些地方的领导机关和领导干部，往往借口某些客观的困难，来原谅自己；往往只在表面现象与枝节问题上兜圈子；有的提出一些似是而非的理由，障碍着对于主要缺点的本质的认识和检讨，这种现象必须继续加以纠正。
    究竟有那些主要的思想障碍，使一些县的人民代表会议没有开好呢？
    “中心工作太多，压的太紧，使我们顾不上建政（指开好人民代表会议）。”这是一种说法。这是把人民代表会议和其他各种中心工作对立的错误的说法。的确，各种工作是十分紧张的。正因为这样就更需要通过人民代表会议，来讨论、布置、推动与完成各种中心工作。谁要是设想人民代表会议可以不着重去处理中心工作，而是“为了开人民代表会议而开人民代表会议”，那末这就是脱离实际的与政府工作对立的一种错误想法，这种想法从来是我们坚决反对的。刘少奇副主席指示我们：各级人民代表会议“应按期召开，‘工作太多’更应召开，以便动员更多的人民和团结人民中的积极分子把这些所谓太多的工作分头地去做好。”“要使各级人民代表会议成为各级人民政府一切工作和一切活动的中心环节。”（在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话）。这不是极明白地指出中心工作多，就更需要加强政权的作用；中心工作越多，人民代表会议的内容应当更充实，应当开得更好吗？最近本报先后发表的平原省济源、朝城，山西省榆社、晋城等县的良好经验，都证明通过中心工作完全能够开好人民代表会议；而人民代表会议开得好，中心工作便可以完成得更加顺利，难道这不是铁的事实吗？
    刘少奇副主席还告诉过我们：“有些政府工作人员是不大愿意召开人民代表会议的，他们习惯于少数人包办一切，而不习惯于和人民的代表商量办事。”这就是目前问题的所在。我们有些同志实际上是不愿意召开或不按期召开人民代表会议，不肯认真去建立国家的基本制度。他们不了解人民代表会议是一种特别有利于有领导地发扬民主而不利于实行包办的组织形式和工作方式；“包办”了它就一定开不好，就“一次不如一次”。
    “开干部会一样能完成任务，人民代表会议不如干部会简便。”这句话是有部分的“真理”的。我们的干部是人民的忠实的勤务员。他们无论在其对革命的贡献或觉悟的程度，特别是他们的忘我工作精神等方面，比起人民代表来，都是毫无愧色的。干部和人民代表都是光荣的，不应该对他们有所歧视。当着战争处在最困难的阶段，我们所处的环境难以经常召开人民代表会议的时候，我们曾用干部会的形式完成过各种任务，在那样情况下，它是比较简便的。就是在今天这样情况下，干部会也还是重要的不可缺少的一种形式。不应笼统地说干部会议和人民代表会议那一个重要那一个不重要。干部会议永远是必需的，有了人民代表会议同样还需要有干部会。但是，不论从那一方面来说，认为开了干部会就不需要开人民代表会议的意见却是完全错误的。毛主席说：“人民政府的一切重要工作都应交人民代表会议讨论，并作出决定。”我们必须这样做才对，不然就是错误的。那末，我们有些同志为什么特别强调干部会而不强调人民代表会议呢？他们为什么把有些人民代表会议实际上开成了普通的干部会呢？为什么把有些人民代表会议实际上改变了它的权力机关的性质呢？在这里，固然有很多客观原因，但最主要的是主观原因，即有一部分领导同志，习惯于在长期残酷的战争环境中所养成的简单化的工作方式，老一套，并习惯于“我说你服”，“决而不议”。这些同志虽然忠心耿耿地给人民当“长工”，然而他们却不喜欢“主人”对他们“发号施令”，“批评监督”，加以“约束”。他们要把人民代表会议在实际上变成普通的干部会，这就说明他们在思想上实际认为国家政权属于人民是有条件的，不是政府干部听命于人民的代表机关即权力机关，不尊重人民代表会议所代行的代表大会职权，而是将人民的民主权力降低到“领导赐予”的地位。不错，按照民主集中制的组织原则，人民政府和人民代表会议，两者是人民民主政权不可分割的整体；人民的代表也是国家的和人民的干部，人民的政府完全有理由要求人民的代表协助政府进行工作，而人民的代表也有接受政府领导的义务。但是，问题却在于单纯给任务而不尊重它的权力，遇到重大问题，不让它来郑重讨论与决定，而只让它来执行被给予的任务；甚至于单纯“使用”人民代表，而不注意发扬他们的政治积极性，因此便削弱了人民代表的主人翁感觉；因此人民的代表机关便单纯地变成了政府的助手，忽视了它应有的职权。这就是我们所应该坚决反对的。
    “国家的事务也就是人民的事务；要东西也是为了人民。”这又是一种说法。不错！我们的国家是人民的国家，政府所有“取之于民”的都仍“用之于民”，即为了人民。但是我们的领导必须是也只能是从群众中来到群众中去。人民代表会议讨论国家事务，讨论生产、税收等与全体人民切身利益有关的重要事项，是十分必需的，任何人都没有理由加以反对。但是既然如此，我们是否就可以一切用命令行事呢？不能！在布置国家的任务时，必须和人民代表充分地讨论协商，使国家事务真正变成人民自己的事务，采取民主的群众路线的领导方式，这是绝对必要的。可是，有些同志却说“时间不够用，来不及协商”。试问真有那么多的紧急的事务而都来不及协商吗？试问在会议上就不可以少作些长篇的报告而让大家有更多时间来进行协商与酝酿吗？有些领导同志处理国家事务，缺乏充分的思想领导和政治领导，没有采取群众路线，他们不关心人民日常生活的共同要求和具体要求，将国家的事务与人民的事务对立起来。这显然是不对的。目前许多县人民代表会议的主要缺点之一，就是不关心人民的日常生活，对于处理人民自己的事务表示冷淡，以致不少县份来自人民群众的提案，日益减少。这种减少，有的是有合理的原因的。如村、区人民代表会议健全了，县人民代表会议上细小问题自然减少；有些突出的问题已经解决了，有些群众的要求和意见，已被领导上正确地集中起来了，因而提案就自然减少了；或者镇压反革命等中心工作特别突出，其他事项就被冲淡了。但是，目前有很多地方，提案的减少并不是由于这些原故，其主要原因仍在于领导上对于提案处理不负责任，敷衍了事，致使人民和他们的代表感到“说话不顶事”，因而严重地影响他们对于人民代表会议的积极性和责任心。这是不能坐视的严重缺陷。
    “只怕上边批评，不怕下边埋怨。”这种想法固然有其客观的历史的原因，但主要的是干部不了解对领导机关负责和直接对人民群众负责的统一性。并有一部分同志骄傲居功，认为“天下是我们打的”，“没有我们办不了事”。因而，他们不尊重人民代表。有些村庄，干部和代表比资格、比功劳。有些干部很不满地说：“谁带红条，谁吃馍馍，谁去作工作。”这种思想反映在人民代表会议工作中，就往往会把人民代表的条件提得过高，对于代表选举的结果因为“害怕不纯洁”而包办代替；不善于团结各界人民共同进行工作。至于在人民代表中，如果发现有不称职的，人民随时加以撤换，则是完全应该的。
    目前思想偏向的存在，是很多县的人民代表会议所以开不好的真实原因。因此，要加强人民民主政权的建设，要健全人民代表会议并改进各级人民政府的领导工作，就必须和这些错误的思想偏向进行不调和的斗争，使人民代表会议真正成为我们国家的根本制度。
