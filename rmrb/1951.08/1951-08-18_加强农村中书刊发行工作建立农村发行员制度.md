    Strengthening Book and Magazine Distribution in Rural Areas and Establishing a Rural Distributor System

    Editor:

    The suggestion made by Comrade Yang Li in the "Reader's Letter" column on July 20th, regarding "Establishing a rural distributor system to strengthen book and magazine distribution in rural areas," is very correct and valuable.

    Xinhua Bookstore has already achieved some success in organizing rural distributors (or salesmen) in the past. Facts have proven that this is a good way to penetrate rural areas and strengthen rural distribution work. Rural salesmen are often more familiar with the needs of the masses and more deeply involved with them than our bookstore staff. It is a pity that this working method has not been promoted throughout the country. Recently, according to a report from our Central and Southern General Branch, the Nanyang branch in Henan Province piloted the rural salesman method, and within two months, nine rural salesmen distributed 24,210 books and magazines, worth over 34 million yuan, which was warmly welcomed by the farmers. The performance of these nine rural salesmen exceeded that of many Xinhua Bookstore branches, and their level of in-depth work is unmatched by an ordinary branch. Based on this preliminary experience, the Central and Southern General Branch has formulated specific measures regarding the selection, training, management, and compensation of rural salesmen, and has called on the entire region to implement them universally.

    Comrade Yang Li's suggestion has further strengthened our determination to promote this working method. In order to organize rural salesmen (which can be divided into two types, professional and amateur) in a more planned and widespread manner, we intend to compile the successful experiences and specific methods of Nanyang and other regions for promotion throughout the entire system.

                                                Xinhua Bookstore General Branch

### 加强农村中书刊发行工作建立农村发行员制度

专栏：读者来信

    加强农村中书刊发行工作建立农村发行员制度编辑同志：
    七月二十日读者来信栏杨力同志向我们提出“建立农村发行员制度，加强农村中书刊发行工作”的建议，是十分正确和宝贵的。
    新华书店在组织农村发行员（或称推销员）方面，过去已经略有成绩。事实证明，它是深入农村加强农村发行工作的一种很好的方法。农村推销员往往比我们书店工作人员更熟悉群众的要求，更深入群众。可惜这种工作方法还没有能推广到全国各地。最近据我店中南总分店报告，河南南阳支店试行农村推销员办法，在两个月内九个农村推销员发行了书刊二万四千二百一十册，价值三千四百余万元，得到农民热烈的欢迎。九个农村推销员的成绩，超过许多新华书店支店的成绩，至于他们工作深入的程度，更非一个普通的支店所能比较了。中南总分店根据这个初步经验，拟订了关于农村推销员的选择、培养、管理、待遇等具体的办法，并号召全区普遍实行。
    杨力同志的建议，更加强了我们推广这种工作方法的决心。为了更有计划，更广泛的组织农村推销员（可以分有职业的和业余的两种），我们拟整理南阳及各地的成功经验及具体办法，向全店推广。
                                                新华书店总店
