Title: In the U.S.-British So-Called "Definitive Draft of the Peace Treaty with Japan," the U.S. Conspiracy to Infringe Upon Our Sovereignty Over Taiwan, Nanwei Island, and Other Islands is Exposed. The Chinese People Will Absolutely Not Tolerate This Robber Behavior of the United States.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: The U.S. imperialists' ambition to conspire to infringe upon China's sacred territorial sovereignty is completely exposed in the U.S.-British "definitive draft of the peace treaty with Japan." The "definitive draft" not only infringes upon China's territorial sovereignty over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands but also infringes upon China's territorial sovereignty over Nanwei Island and the Xisha Islands. The Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate this malicious conspiracy of U.S. and British imperialism.
　　Section B of Article 2 (entitled "Territory") of Chapter 2 of the "definitive draft" stipulates: "Japan renounces all rights, titles, and claims to Taiwan and the Penghu Islands." Section F of the same article stipulates: "Japan renounces all rights, titles, and claims to Nanwei Island and the Xisha Islands." However, the "definitive draft" deliberately avoids mentioning the issue of the ownership of these islands, which belong to China's territorial sovereignty. Everyone knows that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, which the U.S. and British governments participated in and signed, explicitly stipulated that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands should be returned to China. Nanwei Island and the Xisha Islands have always been Chinese territory. Although they were once occupied by Japan during the Anti-Japanese War, they were fully taken over by China after Japan's surrender.
　　When the United States distributed the initial draft of the U.S. "draft peace treaty with Japan" to various countries in late March, United Press reporter Brines reported from Tokyo on March 31st that Dulles stated in a speech at Whittier College in California on March 31st that the U.S. draft deliberately did not determine the status of "this large island (referring to Taiwan) on the flank of the U.S. Pacific defense line." Brines revealed that the reason the United States did this was to attempt "not to let the island fall into the hands of Red China." This revelation by Brines has been completely confirmed by the statements made by Marshall and Acheson in their testimony before the U.S. Congress in May and June of this year. Marshall openly declared: "The established policy of the United States is not to hand over Taiwan to Communist China." Acheson stated that the United States "has an obligation to use military force to achieve this result." Obviously, the U.S.-made "definitive draft" deliberately does not determine the ownership of Taiwan in order to "legalize" the U.S. government's robbery of our Taiwan.
　　The conspiracy of the U.S.-made "definitive draft" to infringe upon our sacred territorial sovereignty over Nanwei Island and the Xisha Islands further exposes the U.S. government's hostility towards the people of our country. Everyone knows that the draft peace treaty with Japan, first published by the U.S. government in early April this year, did not contain the aforementioned Section F of Article 2. However, the U.S.-British "draft peace treaty with Japan" published on July 12th added this clause. After the publication of this draft, the French Foreign Ministry spokesman said unscrupulously on July 20th that the U.S.-British "draft peace treaty conforms to the views of the French government, especially regarding the territorial clauses," and that they "affirm France's sovereignty over Nanwei Island and the Xisha Islands." This absurd and preposterous statement by the French Foreign Ministry, attempting to infringe upon China's territorial sovereignty, is naturally the result of secret deals between the U.S. and France. When warmonger Dulles was in Paris in mid-June, inducing France to participate in a separate peace treaty with Japan, Dulles offered France some bait in exchange for France's support for the U.S.-made draft peace treaty with Japan. Clearly, the U.S. government, in its secret dealings with the French government, has already treated China's sacred territory as pocket money to be privately bartered, colluding with the French government and jointly plotting to occupy our country's Nanwei Island and the Xisha Islands.

### 在美英所谓“对日和约草案定本”中  暴露美国阴谋侵犯我台湾南威等岛主权  中国人民绝对不能容忍美国这种强盗行为

　　在美英所谓“对日和约草案定本”中
    暴露美国阴谋侵犯我台湾南威等岛主权
    中国人民绝对不能容忍美国这种强盗行为
    【新华社二十二日讯】美帝国主义阴谋侵犯中国的神圣领土主权的野心，在美英“对日和约草案定本”中，完全暴露无遗。“草案定本”不仅侵犯中国的台湾和澎湖列岛的领土主权，并且侵犯中国的南威岛和西沙群岛的领土主权。美、英帝国主义的这一恶毒的阴谋，中国人民绝对不能予以容忍。
    “草案定本”第二章（“领土”）第二条乙款规定：“日本放弃对台湾及澎湖列岛的一切权利、权利根据与要求。”同条己款规定：“日本放弃对南威岛及西沙群岛的一切权利、权利根据与要求。”但是，对于这些属于中国领土主权的岛屿的归属问题，“草案定本”却故意避而不提。大家知道，美英两国曾经参加签字的开罗宣言和波茨坦公告，都曾明确地规定台湾和澎湖列岛归还中国。南威岛和西沙群岛向来是中国的领土，抗日战争时期，虽一度被日本侵占，但日本投降后，它们已为中国所全部接收。
    当美国在三月下旬向各国散发美国“对日和约草案”的初稿时，美联社记者布林斯于三月三十一日自东京发出电讯说：杜勒斯于三月三十一日在加利福尼亚州魏蒂尔学院发表演说时表示：美国草案对“在美国太平洋防线侧翼的这个大岛（按指台湾）的地位故意不予确定”。布林斯透露，美国所以如此，是企图“不让该岛落到赤色中国手里”。布林斯这一透露，已为马歇尔与艾奇逊今年五、六月间在美国国会作证的发言所完全证实。马歇尔公然宣告：“美国的既定政策是不把台湾交给共产党中国。”艾奇逊则声言美国“有义务使用军事力量以达到这个结果”。显然地，美制“草案定本”故意不确定台湾的归属，是要使美国政府侵占我国台湾的强盗行为“合法化”。
    美制“草案定本”侵犯我国南威岛和西沙群岛神圣的领土主权的阴谋，尤足暴露美国政府对我国人民的敌视。大家知道，美国政府今年四月初第一次公布的对日和约草案，其中并无上述第二条己款的规定。但今年七月十二日公布的美英“对日和约草案”，却增加了这一款。在这一草案公布后，法国外交部发言人在七月二十日即肆无忌惮地说：美英“和约草案是符合法国政府的见解的，特别是关于领土的条款”，它们“确定了法国对南威岛和西沙群岛的主权”。法国外交部这一荒唐悖谬、妄图侵犯中国领土主权的狂妄发言，自然是美、法两国秘密交易的结果。当六月中旬战争贩子杜勒斯在巴黎诱迫法国参加单独对日和约时，杜勒斯曾向法国提出若干诱饵以换取法国对美制对日和约草案的支持。显然地，美国政府在与法国政府的秘密交易中，是已把中国的神圣领土，当作零用钱来私相授受，并与法国政府狼狈为奸，共同阴谋侵占我国的南威岛和西沙群岛。
