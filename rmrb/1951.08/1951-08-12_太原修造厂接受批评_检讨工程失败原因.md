To the Editors:

Your newspaper's publication of Comrade He Luren's criticism of the errors in our plant's new forging workshop construction project is consistent with the facts. In addition to thanking and accepting Comrade He Luren's criticism, we offer the following review of the errors in our plant's design and construction:

The construction of the forging workshop began in August of last year. Due to a lack of thorough research and design work, geological drilling, and soil load testing before construction, we rushed into construction. As a result, we discovered an air-raid shelter and a layer of ash and slag while digging the foundation, which forced us to deepen some of the concrete column foundations and wall foundations. For example, column foundations in the ash and slag area were deepened by 2.15 meters compared to the original design, and the air-raid shelter area was deepened by 3.35 meters, which increased construction costs and delayed the completion date. Furthermore, due to insufficient engineering design, there were many changes made during the construction process. For example, the engineering of the two rooms in the northeast corner of the forging workshop was changed after construction, increasing reinforced concrete and deepening and thickening the wind bracing wall foundation, which caused chaos in the construction schedule. In particular, the factory building construction was not integrated with the installation of machinery, which added many difficulties to the subsequent installation of mechanical equipment. For example, the height from the ground level of the forging workshop to the fish belly of the overhead crane is 6.8 meters, while the height of the five-ton steam hammer is 7.22 meters, which hinders future installation work.

The creation of this situation is due to the subjective idealism and bureaucratic work style of our leadership cadres at all levels, coupled with the hired-hand mentality and perfunctory work attitude of the engineering designers. These are the main reasons for the many wastes in the forging workshop project. In addition to conducting a preliminary review, and according to the People's Daily editorial of June 16th, and focusing on the materials published in the People's Daily regarding Comrade Chen Yougong's erroneous thinking and other criticisms of the failures of basic construction work, we organized study and discussion, and further examined our basic construction work in 1951, laying a correct ideological foundation for future basic construction work.

### 太原修造厂接受批评  检讨工程失败原因

　　太原修造厂接受批评  检讨工程失败原因
    编辑同志：
    贵报刊载何路仁同志批评我厂新建锻工房工程的错误，是符合事实的。我们除了感谢和接受何路仁同志的批评以外，并将我厂设计和施工方面的错误检讨如下：
    锻工房的建筑工程，是去年八月开工的。由于施工前未做周密的研究、设计工作、地层钻探及土质荷重试验等工作，就急于施工，以致在挖地基时发现了防空洞一处，和部分灰渣层，因而不得不将部分混凝土柱基及墙基加深。如柱基在灰渣处，较原设计加深二点一五公尺，发现防空洞处，加深三点三五公尺，因此增加工程造价，延迟了完工日期。更因工程设计不够周密，在施工期间，随做随改的情形很多。如锻工房东北角两间房子的工程，施工后，改变了原设计，增加钢筋混凝土，加深加厚风撑墙基，以致施工时间发生紊乱现象。尤其厂房建筑，不结合机械之安装，以致使以后的机械设备安装工程增加了很多困难。例如锻工房地平至高车鱼肚为六点八公尺，而五吨蒸汽锤之高为七点二二公尺，妨碍将来之安装工程。
    这种情况的造成，是由于我们各级领导干部存在着主观主义思想和官僚主义作风，再加上工程设计人员的雇佣观念，和敷衍草率的工作态度，是造成锻工房工程许多浪费的主要原因。我们除了进行初步检讨以外，并根据六月十六日人民日报社论，针对着人民日报所载对于陈有功同志的错误思想及其他批评基本建设工作的失败的材料，组织了学习和讨论，并进而检查了我们一九五一年的基本建设工作，为今后进行基本建设工作打下了正确的思想基础。
