　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th—Following the serious incident on August 19th in which the American and Rhee bandit troops illegally intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone near Panmunjom and ambushed our patrol personnel, our delegation representatives General Li Xiangchao and General Xie Fang personally visited the resting place of the remains of Martyr Yao Qingxiang near Panmunjom at around 2:00 PM that same day to express their condolences. The comrades-in-arms of Martyr Yao, from the company he belonged to before his death, bitterly accused the American and Rhee armies of their crimes of sabotaging the armistice negotiations and destroying the neutral zone. The two generals delivered speeches after paying their respects to Martyr Yao. Korean People's Army representative General Li Xiangchao said, "Martyr Yao Qingxiang, who gloriously sacrificed himself to defend peace in Korea, will forever live in the hearts of the Korean people. The incident in which the American and Rhee armies violated the neutral zone agreement, sabotaged the armistice negotiations, and attacked our patrol personnel will not only arouse greater hatred of the Korean and Chinese people towards American imperialism, but will also inevitably arouse unparalleled anger from the people of the world." Chinese People's Volunteer Army representative General Xie Fang also said in his speech, "Martyr Yao Qingxiang sacrificed himself while standing on the peaceful front line of defending the Kaesong armistice negotiations. His noble quality of sacrificing his life for peace will surely inspire the firm determination of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to defend peace." Subsequently, Qiao Wanfeng, the deputy company commander of Martyr Yao's company, spoke, expressing his boundless indignation at the martyrdom of his excellent comrade-in-arms. He said: Platoon Leader Yao sacrificed himself to protect the safety of the Kaesong neutral zone. We must follow in the footsteps of the martyr, strive harder to achieve a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and fight to the end to defend world peace.
                Note: Martyr Yao Qingxiang was of worker origin, a member of the Communist Party of China, and twenty-two years old this year, from Yaojiazhuang, Ninth District, Jidong County, Shandong Province (a newly established county east of Jinan). Martyr Yao joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army in October 1945 and served as a communication soldier, squad leader, and other positions. Last year, when our people organized the Volunteer Army to Resist America and Aid Korea and Defend Our Homes and Country, Martyr Yao also signed up to join the Volunteer Army. In his work and battles, he was consistently active, responsible, dedicated, and courageous. He has been commended three times and was an outstanding junior commander in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　我方代表亲赴板门店附近
    向姚庆祥烈士致哀
    连队战士悲愤控诉美李军罪行
    【新华社开城二十日电】八月十九日美李匪军非法侵入开城中立区板门店附近，突袭我方巡逻人员的严重事件发生后，我方代表团代表李相朝、解方两将军即于当天下午二时许亲赴板门店附近的姚排长庆祥烈士遗体停放处致哀。姚烈士生前所在连队的战友们纷纷向他们悲愤地控诉美李军破坏停战谈判破坏中立区的罪行。两将军向姚烈士致哀后曾发表讲话。朝鲜人民军代表李相朝将军说：“为保卫朝鲜和平而光荣殉难的姚庆祥烈士，将永远活在朝鲜人民的心里。美李军违犯中立区协议，破坏停战谈判，向我方巡逻人员袭击的事件，不仅激起朝中人民对美帝国主义更大的仇恨，并一定要激起全世界人民无比的愤怒。”中国人民志愿军代表解方将军也在讲话中说：“姚庆祥烈士是站在保卫开城停战谈判的和平前哨上牺牲的。他这种为了和平而献出自己生命的高贵品质，一定会激励中国人民志愿军捍卫和平的坚强决心。”接着，姚烈士所在连队的副连长乔万风讲话，他对自己优秀战友的殉难表示无限的愤慨。他说：姚排长是为保卫开城中立区的安全而牺牲的。我们要踏着烈士的血迹，用更大的努力争取和平解决朝鲜问题，为保卫世界和平而奋斗到底。
                按：姚庆祥烈士系工人出身，中国共产党党员，今年二十二岁，山东省济东县（在济南东部为新设县）九区姚家庄人。姚烈士于一九四五年十月参加中国人民解放军，历任通讯员、班长等职。去年，我国人民组织抗美援朝保家卫国志愿军时，姚烈士又报名参加志愿军。他在工作与战斗中，一贯积极负责，埋头苦干，英勇坚强，先后曾立功三次，是中国人民志愿军中一个优秀的初级指挥员。
