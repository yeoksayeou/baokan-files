Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 3rd (TASS dispatch): U.S. Communist Party Chairman Foster and National Committee member Flynn, representing the U.S. Communist Party National Committee, issued a letter to the American people, calling on the American people to stop the reactionary forces' attack on democratic rights, and to fight for the abolition of the reactionary Smith Act and the defense of the Bill of Rights.

The letter to the people first pointed out that the illegal actions of the U.S. authorities in persecuting progressive forces are due to the fear of the American monopoly capital of the people and the people's desire for peace. What monopoly capital fears is what the people can do. Peace can be won. The Bill of Rights can be saved. The people can and will be victorious in this struggle.

However, the letter to the people reminded people not to underestimate the seriousness of the current situation, pointing out that anti-communist hysteria, loyalty investigations, the McCarran Act, the intensified oppression of black people, and the recent barbaric arrests and arbitrary deprivation of constitutional rights show that the United States is facing a real and obvious danger of fascism and war, and the country has reached a decisive moment. The letter to the people said: If the American people think that the authorities' actions are only aimed at the Communists, then they are making the biggest historical mistake. If the people of the whole country do not rise up to stop it now, this behavior will develop and expand until it envelops the whole country.

The letter to the people called on all Americans to rise up to stop the terror, to oppose the traitors who are preparing to eliminate the Bill of Rights and drag the American people into war. The letter to the people said: By doing so, the American people will not only save their own democratic rights, but also expand their democratic rights.

The letter to the people especially called on trade union members and black people to organize and fight against the Smith Act and defend constitutional rights, and demanded that all Americans organize committees and delegations to defend the Bill of Rights, demanding that the government stop illegal arrests in order to safeguard the Bill of Rights.

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: In coordination with the currently intensified war preparations, the U.S. government has begun to take openly unconstitutional judicial persecution against communists and progressives.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court unreasonably ruled that the Smith Act was not unconstitutional, and ruled to uphold the judgment made by the New York Federal Court against the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party under this completely unconstitutional fascist law, the U.S. judicial authorities and secret police have more and more openly used brutal and unreasonable means to launch a larger-scale persecution. Following the arrest of the second batch of 17 U.S. Communist Party cadres on June 20 (with another four being hunted), and the arrest of the third batch of 11 U.S. Communist Party cadres on July 26, the U.S. judicial authorities arrested the fourth batch of five U.S. Communist Party cadres in New York, Cleveland, and Baltimore on August 7, namely: Roy Wood, Rosie Blueben, Philip Frankfield, and Frankfield's wife, Regina Meyer.

From this frenzied persecution of the Communist Party, it can be seen that the U.S. government has completely undermined the constitutional rights of the American people. When the U.S. judicial authorities arrested the third batch of U.S. Communist Party cadres, the U.S. judicial authorities did not even file a formal indictment in advance. The FBI agents even broke into the inner room without even a formal warrant, and openly said to the arrested person who protested that there was no need for a warrant anymore, because they were arrested under the Smith Act! In this way, the U.S. government directly violated the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which stipulates that no search or arrest shall be made without a valid warrant, and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which stipulates that no citizen shall be deprived of liberty without due process of law.

In order to facilitate the conviction of the arrested and put them in jail, the U.S. courts again violated the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which stipulates that no innocent person shall be forced to confess their guilt, forced the defendant to answer questions that were unfavorable to him; violated the Sixth Amendment, which stipulates that the defendant should be given evidence favorable to him; and violated the Eighth Amendment, which stipulates that excessive bail should not be imposed, ruling that the defendant's bail should be as high as 100,000 US dollars per person.

One of the nine "crimes" brought against the defendants in the indictment announced by the U.S. judicial authorities after the third batch of 11 U.S. Communist Party cadres were arrested and imprisoned was "publishing, disseminating, and encouraging the publication and dissemination of" so-called "books, essays, magazines, and newspapers" that incite or advocate "overthrowing the government." In other words, it was because they promoted socialism and ideas of peace and democracy. In this way, the entire Bill of Rights has been destroyed without a trace. The democratic freedom of all the American people is now facing the most serious threat.

　　反对杜鲁门政府法西斯迫害
    美共号召人民保卫民主权利
    美反动当局竟又逮捕美共干部五人
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社纽约三日讯，美国共产党主席福斯特及全国委员会委员佛林代表美共全国委员会发表告美国人民书，号召美国人民制止反动派对民主权利的进攻，并为废除反动的史密斯法和保卫权利法案而斗争。
    告人民书首先指出：美国当局迫害进步力量的非法行为，是由于美国垄断资本恐惧人民及人民要求和平的意志。垄断资本恐惧的便是人民能够做到的事。和平是可以争取的。权利法案是可以挽救的。人民在这个斗争中是可以胜利也必将胜利的。
    但是，告人民书提醒不可小看目前情况的严重性，指出反共的歇斯底里、忠诚调查、麦卡伦法、对黑人的加紧压迫以及新近发生的蛮横的逮捕与任意剥夺宪法权利的事情，说明美国面临着现实而明显的法西斯主义与战争的危险，国家已到了决定性的关头。告人民书说：如果美国人认为当局的这种行为只是对付共产党人的，那就犯了最大的历史性错误。如果现在全国人民不奋起制止，这种行为便要发展扩大，直到笼罩全国为止。
    告人民书号召全体美国人起来制止恐怖，反对准备消灭权利法案并把美国人民拖进战争的叛逆分子。告人民书说：美国人民这样做，不仅将挽救自己的民主权利，而且还将扩大自己的民主权利。
    告人民书特别号召工会会员及黑种人民组织起来，为反对史密斯法、保卫宪法权利而斗争，并要求全体美国人组织保卫权利法案的委员会和代表团，要求政府制止非法逮捕，以维护权利法案。
    【新华社八日讯】配合着目前加紧进行的备战活动，美国政府已开始对共产党及进步人士采取了公然破坏宪法的司法迫害。
    自从美国最高法院无理地判定史密斯法为并不违宪，并裁决维持纽约联邦法院根据这个完全违反宪法的法西斯法律对美国共产党十一位领袖所作的判决之后，美国司法当局和秘密警察就愈来愈公开地以横蛮无理的手段展开了更大规模的迫害。继六月二十日逮捕第二批美共干部十七人（另有四人在搜捕中），于七月二十六日逮捕第三批美共干部十一人之后，美国司法当局又于八月七日在纽约、克利夫兰、巴尔的摩三地逮捕了第四批美共干部五人，即：罗伊·伍德，罗西·布鲁本，菲力浦·法兰菲尔德，法兰菲尔德夫人丽锦娜·梅耶。
    从对共产党进行的这种疯狂迫害中，可以看出美国政府已完全破坏了美国人民的宪法权利。美国司法当局在逮捕第三批美共干部时，美国司法当局事先甚至没有提出公诉状，联邦调查局的特务甚至连形式上的拘票都不带，破门直入内室，并公然向提出抗议的被捕者说，再用不着拘票了，因为他们是根据史密斯法逮捕的！这样，美国政府就直接破坏了规定非有合格令状不得进行搜查和拘捕的宪法第四条修正案，以及规定非经正当法律程序不得剥夺公民自由的宪法第五条修正案。
    为了便于将被捕者定罪，并把他们下狱，美国法院又破坏了宪法第五条修正案关于不得强迫任何无辜的人招供罪状的规定，强迫被告回答不利于自己的问题；破坏规定应使被告得到有利于他的见证的第六条修正案；并违反规定不得判处过高保释金的第八条修正案，判定了被告的保释金最高竟达一个人十万美元的数目。
    美国司法当局在把第三批十一名美共干部逮捕并下狱了以后才公布的公诉状，对被告提出的九条“罪”名之一，就是“出版、传播及鼓励出版和传播那些教唆或主张”所谓“推翻政府”的阴谋的“书籍、论文、杂志、报纸”。也就是说因为他们宣传了社会主义与和平民主的思想。这样，全部权利法案已被破坏无遗。全美国人民的民主自由现在已受到了最严重的威胁。
