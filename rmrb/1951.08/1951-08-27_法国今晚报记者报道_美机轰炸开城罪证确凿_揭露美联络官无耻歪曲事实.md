　　Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Paris "Tonight" newspaper reporter, Be Que-di, filed a dispatch from Kaesong on the 24th, reporting on the conclusive evidence of the US bombing of the Kaesong conference area and exposing the shameless behavior of the US liaison officer in deliberately distorting the facts.
    Be Que-di said that at the location of the six bomb craters, there were tail fins of American bombs, about six inches long and two inches wide. These bombs were identical to the American fragmentation bombs I saw during my two-plus years of service in the US Army Air Forces and Naval Air Forces during the Pacific War. Around these locations, the ground was covered with small metal fragments, each about four to five centimeters long and two centimeters thick. There were markings on a piece of the skin of a napalm bomb. There were purple letters printed on it, with a purple line one-third of the way from the top. The skin was marked with "Incendiary AN4343MFG 1945 REWKD TAD 1950" and so on. The second piece of napalm bomb skin also had the same text, with the number four-three-four-three. The black gasoline foam, which was in a semi-liquid state when the US liaison officer Kenny was present, has now turned into asphalt blocks and smells a bit like burnt rubber. Each bomb burned the grass and dense shrubs within a five-meter radius. This is why Kenny refused to conduct an investigation, and when I raised a few points for him to pay attention to, he ordered me to leave the area. He rarely approached within ten feet of the evidence, always asking, "Is this what you want me to see? Let's go back immediately." His pretentious attitude was clearly rehearsed and instructed beforehand.
    Today, I spoke with Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier Liu Youzhi (transliteration), who was the soldier whose evidence Kenny tried to make people disbelieve. Kenny quoted him as saying that the airplane's headlights were on. Liu Youzhi told me: when the plane initially approached, the red and green lights on the wingtips were on, but the lights were turned off before dropping the bombs. Kenny's report said that the bomb tail fins were rocket tail fins, and that the incendiary bombs were not American. Joye's reply implied: that the plane might be a "Communist plane." There were ten witnesses in Kaesong, but Kenny refused to examine the evidence or talk to the witnesses. He only spoke to one soldier, but even this time, he intentionally distorted what his own interpreter translated. If Kenny could see bomb tail fins as rocket tail fins, bomb craters as hand grenade craters, and not recognize American incendiary bombs, then we are even more convinced that he did so either intentionally to deceive or that his behavior was more like a cunning lawyer than an Air Force colonel, even though he was wearing an Air Force colonel's uniform. As for the so-called Communist plane dropping bombs and firing, we have to ask, how could an air force that claims to have air superiority all the way to the Yalu River allow a single "enemy plane" to fly over an area five miles from its front line? Kenny's biggest lie is that he reported to Joye that Colonel Zhang announced that the talks would be stopped forever. My notes at the time show that Colonel Zhang only said that the talks would be stopped on Thursday.

    美机轰炸开城罪证确凿
    揭露美联络官无耻歪曲事实
    【新华社二十六日讯】法国巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌二十四日发自开城的消息报道了美机轰炸开城会议地区的罪证，并揭露了美方联络官故意歪曲事实的无耻行为。
    贝却敌说，在六个弹坑的地方，有美国炸弹的尾翅，长约六英寸，宽约二英寸。这些炸弹和我在太平洋战争时在美国陆军空军与海军空军服务两年多所看到的美国杀伤弹一模一样。在这些地方的周围，遍地都是长四、五糎、宽厚各二糎的小块金属碎片。在一块凝固汽油弹的弹皮上有一些标志。上面印有紫色的字母，在距顶端三分之一的地方有一道紫色的线。弹皮上有着Incendiary AN4343MFG 1945 REWKD TAD 1950等字样。第二块凝固汽油弹弹皮上也有同样的文字，号数是四三四三。当美方联络官肯尼在场时，黑色的汽油泡沫是半液体状态的，现在已变成了柏油块的样子，闻起来有点像烧焦的橡皮。每个炸弹将五公尺半径周围的草和浓密的灌木都烧焦了。以上是肯尼为什么拒绝进行调查，并在我提出几点请他注意的时候，他命令我离开那个地区的原因。他很少走近到距离证据十英尺以内的地方，总是问道：“你们要我看的就是这些吗？让我们立刻回去吧。”他的装模作样的态度，显然是预先演习过并获得训示的。
    今天我与中国志愿军战士刘友治（译音）谈话，他就是肯尼力图使人不相信他提供的证据的那个战士。肯尼曾引他的话说，那个飞机的前灯是亮着的。刘友治对我说：飞机最初飞近的时候，机翼尖端的红绿灯是亮的，但是在投炸弹之前灯就关了。肯尼的报告说炸弹尾翅是火箭尾翅，又说燃烧弹不是美国的。乔埃的答复暗示：那架飞机也许是“共产党的飞机”。开城有成十名见证人，肯尼却拒绝审查证据，也不肯和目击者谈话。他只和一个战士说过话，但是这一次，他甚至把他自己的通译员所翻译的，也有意加以歪曲。如果肯尼竟能把炸弹尾翅看成火箭尾翅，把炸弹坑看成手榴弹弹穴，认不得美国的燃烧弹，那么，我们就更加相信：他所以这样作，如果不是有意欺骗，就是他的行径更像一个狡猾的讼棍，而不是一个空军上校，虽然他穿着空军上校的制服。至于所谓是共方飞机投弹和开枪，我们就要问，一支自称握有直到鸭绿江边制空权的空军，怎么可能允许单独一架“敌机”飞临距它的前线五英里的地区的上空呢？肯尼最大的撒谎，就是他向乔埃报告说：张上校宣告会谈永远停止。我当时所记的笔记却表明，张上校只说星期四会谈停止。
