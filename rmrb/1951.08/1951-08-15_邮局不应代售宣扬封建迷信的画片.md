　　Post Offices Should Not Sell Picture Cards Promoting Feudal Superstition

　　On July 4th, I went to the Zhuyetang market town and saw a peddler selling pictures, all of which were feudal superstitious images such as "Qilin Bringing a Son." According to this peddler, he purchased them from the post office. I believe that today's culture and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and should not continue to promote and praise this kind of feudal superstitious thinking. This has too great an impact on the people. I think that in addition to the relevant departments taking appropriate steps to stop the publication and distribution of such poisonous picture cards, post offices should also pay attention to the political and ideological content when purchasing newspapers and periodicals. This is a responsible attitude towards the people.

　　邮局不应代售宣扬封建迷信的画片
    七月四日我到竹叶塘集镇上去，看见一个小贩在卖画，卖的尽是“麒麟送子”等内容封建迷信的画片。据这个小贩说，他是由邮局代购的。我觉得今天的文化艺术应该为工农兵服务，不应该继续宣扬与歌颂这种封建迷信思想。这对人民的影响太大了。我觉得除有关部门应采取适当步骤制止这种有毒害内容画片的出版和发行之外，邮局代购书报也应该注意它的政治思想内容。这样，才是对人民负责的态度。
