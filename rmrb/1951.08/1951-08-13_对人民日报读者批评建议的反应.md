Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to People's Daily

    The Newly Built Road from South Xiaojie to Gongmenkou in Beijing Suffers from Cracks and Subsidence
    The Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau Made a Self-Criticism and Decided to Send Workers to Repair It

Comrades Editors:

    We have received the letter you forwarded from a reader criticizing our bureau's road construction work. The road from Xizhimen South Xiaojie to Gongmenkou is one of the simple cobblestone roads planned and built in 1950 to improve the dirt roads in the hutongs. It is only six centimeters thick and was built at a low cost. Due to insufficient rolling power at the time, its completion was delayed until this year. Shortly after the road was opened to traffic, potholes and water accumulation were discovered. At that time, our bureau notified the construction department to conduct an inspection. After receiving the letter of criticism you forwarded on June 29, we again convened relevant units for further inspection. The shortcomings we exhibited in the construction of this road were insufficient planning and inaccurate estimates of the traffic volume at the time and in the short term. We only considered saving money and neglected durability. At the same time, we only considered the needs of transportation and underestimated the drainage problem, resulting in a decision to use the road surface slope for drainage without adequate sewer facilities. However, because the road is too long, the accumulated water cannot be completely drained, which makes the road surface more susceptible to damage. This shows that our poor road construction work has already had a very negative political impact on the masses. We sincerely accept the criticism from the masses and will strive to improve our future work. Our bureau has decided to send workers to repair this section of the road and strengthen its future maintenance.

            Attached is the original letter of criticism:

Comrades Editors:

    The road from Xizhimen South Xiaojie to Fuchengmen Gongmenkou has only been completed for two months, but there are already potholes in many places. Especially after the recent heavy rain, some parts of the road are already muddy. The masses feel it is a great pity to see the road damaged so soon after it was built. Everyone hopes that the Construction Bureau will repair this road and pay attention to the quality of the project when building roads in the future.

         The Hebei Daily Editorial Department's Self-Criticism for Publishing the Article "What Ethnic Minorities are There in China"

Comrades Editors:

    The People's Daily published a letter in the "Readers' Letters" column on July 22 criticizing the article "What Ethnic Minorities are There in China" published in the "Cultural Palace" column of our newspaper on July 8. As pointed out in the letter, this is an intolerable error. The reason for this error is mainly that the editor of "Cultural Palace" lacked a serious and conscientious work attitude when selecting and publishing the manuscript; and the comrades at all levels responsible for reviewing the manuscript and proofs did not carefully review them. At the same time, this error occurred after your newspaper's "Book Review" section criticized the erroneous publication of this article by "Chahar Education," which is even more inexcusable. After discovering this error, we realized that it was a serious political error that insulted our minority brothers and sisters. In order to correct this error, we have made a public self-criticism in the "Cultural Palace" column of our newspaper on July 15, and corrected the erroneous parts of the original text. The occurrence of this error has made us deeply aware of the importance of further strengthening the political and ideological leadership of the editorial staff and establishing a high sense of responsibility in our work. We will work hard in the above two aspects in the future to prevent similar errors from happening again.

            The Yawei Stenography School's Self-Criticism of the Errors in the Regulations and Explanations

Comrades Editors:

    The People's Daily published a letter in the "Readers' Letters" column on July 19 from Comrade Lou Zhenling criticizing the offensive language in the school's regulations and explanations, pointing out that the phrase "If, in the unlikely event, prices fluctuate" in "A Letter to Those Aspiring to Learn Stenography" in the school's regulations and explanations is extremely inappropriate. This criticism is very correct and beneficial. The school's regulations and explanations were adapted after the liberation of Shanghai, when prices were still subject to some fluctuations; however, since March of last year, thanks to the correct measures of the Central People's Government, national prices have been basically stabilized. We did not correctly recognize the negative impact caused by this sentence, and when we partially adapted the regulations and explanations again in December 1950, we did not conduct a comprehensive inspection and timely revision. This is a manifestation of our ideological paralysis and careless work. Before the People's Daily raised this criticism, we had already discovered this error and have already corrected it in the recently adapted and printed regulations and explanations.

            The Self-Criticism of Wu Junling, a Distributor at the Manzhouli Post Office, for Delaying a Reader's Newspaper Subscription

Comrades Editors:

    The matter of Comrade Mao Chun Chang, a reader in Manzhouli, subscribing to the Northeast Daily and delaying the date of reading the newspaper (the original criticism was published in the People's Daily on March 14) was mainly caused by my personal lack of enthusiasm to serve readers and my fear of trouble. Comrade Mao came to our office on February 19 to subscribe to the Northeast Daily, and he should have been able to start reading the newspaper on March 10; however, because my fear of trouble was at work, I thought that our office's subscription numbers for March had already been reported to the Hailar Command Bureau on February 15. At the same time, I also thought that the Northeast Daily was mainly focused on consolidation and did not require development, and in addition, I had collected newspaper fees from Comrade Mao Chun Chang's home several times in the past, and I felt that collecting fees was a bit difficult, so I did not immediately accept the subscription.

    Comrade Mao Chun Chang's criticism has made me realize my mistakes, and I will definitely serve readers enthusiastically in the future and ensure that I do not make similar mistakes again.

### 对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    北京市南小街至宫门口新修马路发生陷裂
    市人民政府建设局作了检讨并决定派工修整编辑同志：
    你们转来读者对我局修路工作的批评信一封收到。西直门南小街至宫门口一路，是一九五○年度为改善胡同土路而计划修筑的简易卵石路之一。厚仅六公分。造价低廉。因为当时碾力不足，所以推延到今年才完工。该路修竣后开放不久，即发现有坑坎和积水现象，当时我局曾通知施工部门进行检查。六月二十九日接到你们转来的批评信后，我们又召集有关单位继续进行检查。我们在修筑这条路的工作中所表现的缺点，是计划不够，对于当时以及短期间可能发展的交通量情况估计不确，只是为了省钱而忽视了耐久。同时我们仅考虑到交通需要情况，对于排水问题估计不足，结果决定利用路面坡度排水，而没有完善的下水道设备。但因该路过长，积水却无法全部排除，这样便使路面更易于破坏。这说明因为我们的修路工作做得不好，已在群众中造成了很不好的政治影响。我们诚恳地接受群众的批评，一定努力改进今后的工作。对于这一段路，我局已决定派工修理并加强今后的护养工作。
                                           北京市人民政府建设局
            附原批评信一件编辑同志：
    由西直门南小街至阜成门宫门口这条路才修好两个月，但有很多地方已经有了坑洼，特别是这次下过大雨之后，路上有些地方已经是泥泞不堪了。群众看到这条路刚修好就坏了，觉得很可惜。大家希望建设局对这条路进行一番整修，并且今后修路时注意到工程质量问题。

         河北日报编辑部对发表《中国有那些少数民族》一文的检讨编辑同志：
    人民日报七月二十二日《读者来信》栏发表了对本报七月八日“文化宫”栏所载《中国有那些少数民族》一文的批评信。如同来信所指出的，这是一个不能容忍的错误。我们发生这一错误的原因，主要是“文化宫”编者在选发稿件时缺乏严肃认真的工作态度；各级负责审稿的同志，对编出的稿件及大样没有仔细审阅。同时，这一错误发生在贵报“书报评论”版对“察哈尔教育”错误地刊登该文进行了批评之后，这就更加不应该的了。我们在发觉这一错误后，认识到这是一个严重地侮辱了少数兄弟民族的政治性错误。为了纠正这一错误，我们已在七月十五日本报“文化宫”栏作了公开的检讨，并对原文的错误部分作了修正。这次错误的发生，使我们深刻地认识到进一步加强编辑部人员政治思想领导的重要，树立高度的工作责任心的重要。我们今后将从以上两方面努力，以使类似错误不再发生。

            亚伟速记学校对章则说明书中的错误的检讨编辑同志：
    七月十九日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊出娄振岭同志对本校章则说明书中有恶劣语句的批评信，指出本校章则说明书“给有志学习速记的一封信”里“如果万一物价波动”这句话是极不妥当的。这个批评，是非常正确和有益的。本校章则说明书改编于上海解放以后，当时物价尚有部分波动；但自去年三月以来，由于中央人民政府的正确措施，全国物价已经基本稳定。我们没有正确认识到这句话所引起的恶劣影响，在一九五○年十二月再度局部改编章则说明书时，没有全面检查，及时修改。这是我们思想麻痹和工作粗枝大叶的表现。在人民日报提出批评以前，我们已经发觉这种错误，并已经在最近改编印出的章则说明书中改正了。

            满洲里邮局发行员吴俊玲对延误读者订报的检讨编辑同志：
    满洲里读者毛春昌向本局订阅东北日报迟误了看报日期的事（原批评刊载三月十四日人民日报），主要是由于我个人缺乏为读者服务的热情和怕麻烦所引起的。毛同志是二月十九日到本局订阅东北日报，本来可以在三月十日开始看到报纸；但是因为我的怕麻烦的思想作怪，我认为本局三月份订销报数，已于二月十五日报到海拉尔指挥局了，同时我又想到东北日报是以巩固为主并不要求发展，再加上我过去到毛春昌同志家中收过几次报费，感到收费有些困难，所以就没有即时接受订阅。
    经过毛春昌同志的批评，使我认识了自己的错误，今后一定为读者热诚服务，保证不再犯类似的错误。
