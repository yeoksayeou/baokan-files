Notice Regarding Commemoration Measures for the September 3rd Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan

In order to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the September 3rd Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the local branches of this association should immediately contact the local People's Political Consultative Conference or the Standing Committee of the People's Congress, democratic party organizations, people's organizations, and representatives from all walks of life, to hold representative cadre or mass celebration meetings and various lecture meetings and forums with thousands of people on September 2nd (Sunday) or 3rd. All national newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and other propaganda and educational institutions should, on and around September 3rd, conduct publicity on the glorious history of the Chinese people achieving victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the assistance of the Soviet army in liberating Northeast China. The content of the publicity should focus on opposing the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan, rearming Japan, continuing to invade Korea and our territory of Taiwan, and undermining the Kaesong talks. It should also continue to enhance the fraternal friendship of the Chinese people with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, continue to increase the Chinese people's confidence in the victory of the anti-imperialist struggle, and continue to strengthen the Chinese people's righteous struggle to resist America and aid Korea.

Appendix: Key Points for Propaganda on the September 3rd Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan This Year

	I. The War of Resistance Against Japan ended with the defeat of Japanese imperialism. This is a great transformation from failure to victory in the Chinese people's anti-imperialist struggle over the past century.

	The reason why the Chinese people were able to win the War of Resistance Against Japan is because the Chinese people already had the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, united together, developed the People's Liberation Army and the People's Liberation Zones, and effectively shattered the Japanese imperialists' invasion plans and the American imperialists' lackey, the Kuomintang reactionaries' surrender and division plans. It was also because the Chinese people received the long-term spiritual and material support from the Soviet Union and the great assistance of the final dispatch of troops to liberate Northeast China and eliminate the Japanese Kwantung Army.

	The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, are an invincible force.

	II. The defeat of Japan was mainly due to the efforts of the Chinese people and the Soviet Union.

	China was the country that fought against Japan the earliest, for the longest time, and resisted the most enemies. The Chinese people began to resist Japanese aggression as early as the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, and began the nationwide War of Resistance Against Japan from the "July 7th Incident" in 1937. Of the more than three million Japanese army soldiers, the Chinese army and civilians resisted or contained more than two-thirds, that is, more than two million. The Chinese People's Liberation Army (the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army at that time) and the People's Guerrilla were the main force in the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they resisted 65 percent of the Japanese troops and 95 percent of the puppet troops in China, and eliminated more than 1.3 million Japanese and puppet troops.

	In August 1945, the Soviet Union sent troops to Northeast China and eliminated the elite Kwantung Army of the Japanese army, which determined the fate of Japan and forced Japan to surrender. From the very beginning of China's war against Japan, the Soviet Union provided active and substantial assistance. Even during the Soviet-German War, the Soviet Union still maintained forty divisions on the border of Northeast China to contain Japanese forces.

	In contrast to the Soviet Union, the American and British imperialists did their best to seek compromise with Japan before December 1941, and the United States provided Japan with a large amount of strategic raw materials. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, although the United States and Britain were forced to fight against Japan, they were never active. It was not until the Soviet Union sent troops to Northeast China and achieved great victories that the United States hastily used atomic bombs to make a show of force and seize the fruits of victory, ending the war under conditions favorable to American imperialism and Japanese aggressive forces. On the Chinese battlefield, the United States provided a large amount of assistance to the Kuomintang, which was passively resisting Japan but actively opposing the Communist Party and the people. After Japan surrendered, it sent troops to land in China, not to oppose Japanese aggression, but to enslave the Chinese people.

	III. American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people today.

	After Japan surrendered, American imperialism replaced the position of Japanese imperialism and attempted to turn China into an American colony. For this purpose, the American government provided a large amount of assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang to launch a war against the Chinese people.

	After the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, American imperialism continued to be hostile to China. The American government continued to support Chiang Kai-shek, the enemy of the Chinese people, and directly carried out various sabotage activities in China. The United States sent armed forces to occupy China's Taiwan. The United States launched a large-scale attack on China's friendly neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with the aim of preparing to invade China. The United States rearmed Japan with the aim of preparing to invade China and other Asian countries, and excluded China from participating in the peace conference with Japan.

	IV. The Chinese people have the power to defeat the American invasion plan.

	The Chinese people must resolutely oppose the American aggression against China and Korea, resolutely oppose the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan, and continue to strengthen the struggle to resist America and aid Korea. In this struggle, we will surely be able to achieve victory, because China is completely different from the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan. China has become a powerful and unified people's democratic country, and has formed a solid alliance of friendship and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union, while imperialism is becoming more and more isolated and weaker day by day in the world. The United States occupies Japan and turns Japan into its own colony and a base for aggression against Asia. This cannot but arouse the resistance of the Japanese people and the people of Asian countries against American imperialism. The United States' sabotage of the Kaesong talks and the convening of a unilateral peace conference with Japan demonstrate the viciousness of American imperialism. However, the Chinese and Korean people will step up their struggle and unite with the people of all countries in the world to crush the crazy aggression of the United States and achieve final victory.

　　中国人民抗美援朝总会
    关于九月三日抗日战争胜利日纪念办法的通知
    为纪念九月三日抗日战争胜利六周年纪念日，本会各地分会应即联络各地各界人民代表会议协商委员会或各界人民代表会议常务委员会、各民主党派组织、各人民团体和各界代表人物，在九月二日（星期日）或三日，举行数千人的代表性质的干部或群众庆祝会和各种演讲会、座谈会。全国各报纸、杂志、广播电台和其他宣传教育机构，应在九月三日及其前后，进行关于中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在苏联军队解放东北的援助下，取得抗日战争胜利的光荣历史的宣传。宣传内容应着重反对美国单独对日媾和、重新武装日本、继续侵略朝鲜和我国领土台湾、破坏开城谈判这一切事实，继续增进全国人民对于苏联和人民民主国家的兄弟友谊，继续提高全国人民对于反帝国主义斗争的胜利信心，继续加强全国人民关于抗美援朝的正义斗争。
      中国人民抗美援朝总会  一九五一年八月三十日
  附：今年九月三日抗日战争胜利日的宣传要点
    一、抗日战争以日本帝国主义的失败而结束，这是近百年来中国人民的反帝国主义斗争由失败走到胜利的伟大转变。
    中国人民所以能够取得抗日战争的胜利，是因为中国人民已经有了中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导而团结起来，发展了人民解放军和人民解放区，有效地打破了日本帝国主义的侵略计划和美帝国主义走狗国民党反动派的投降分裂计划，是因为中国人民得到了苏联在精神上与物质上的长期支援和最后出兵解放东北、消灭日本关东军的伟大援助。
    在中国共产党领导下，在苏联援助下的中国人民，是不可战胜的力量。
    二、打败日本主要是中国人民和苏联的功劳。
    中国是对日作战最早、作战时间最长、抗击敌人最多的国家。中国人民从一九三一年“九一八事变”起就开始抵抗日本侵略，从一九三七年“七七事变”起就开始了全国的抗日战争。在日本陆军三百多万人中，中国军民抗击了或牵制了三分之二以上即二百多万人。中国人民解放军（当时的八路军和新四军）和人民游击队，是中国抗日战争的主力。他们在抗日战争中抗击了在中国的日军百分之六十五和伪军百分之九十五，消灭了日伪军一百三十多万人。
    苏联在一九四五年八月出兵东北，消灭日本陆军中精锐的关东军，决定了日本的命运，迫使日本投降。中国对日抗战一开始，苏联就给以积极、大量的援助。即在苏德战争时期，苏联仍在中国东北边境保持着四十个师以牵制日本的兵力。
    与苏联相反，美英帝国主义，在一九四一年十二月以前竭力寻求对日妥协，美国并以大量的战略原料援助日本。在一九四一年十二月日本袭击珍珠港事件发生后，美英虽已被迫对日作战，但是始终不积极，直到苏联出兵东北获得巨大胜利后，美国才匆忙地以投掷原子弹来虚张声势地夺取胜利的果实，使战争在有利于美帝国主义和日本侵略势力的条件下结束。在中国战场上，美国曾大量援助消极抗日，积极反共反人民的国民党，并在日本投降后派兵到中国登陆，其目的不是反对日本侵略，而是为了奴役中国人民。
    三、美帝国主义是今天中国人民的死敌。
    日本投降后，美帝国主义代替了日本帝国主义的地位，企图把中国变为美国的殖民地，为着这个目的，美国政府大量地援助了蒋介石国民党发动反对中国人民的内战。
    中国人民解放战争胜利以后，美帝国主义继续敌视中国。美国政府继续支持中国人民公敌蒋介石，并直接在中国进行各种破坏活动。美国派遣武装力量霸占了中国的台湾。美国以准备侵略中国为目的大举进攻中国友好邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。美国以准备侵略中国和其他亚洲国家为目的而重新武装日本，并排斥中国参加对日和会。
    四、中国人民有力量战胜美国的侵略计划。
    中国人民要坚决反对美国对于中国和朝鲜的侵略，坚决反对美国单独对日媾和，继续加强抗美援朝的斗争。在这斗争中我们一定能够得到胜利，因为中国已经和抗日战争时期完全不同，中国已经成为强大的统一的人民民主国家，并且与苏联结成了巩固的友好互助同盟，而帝国主义在世界上却一天比一天孤立，一天比一天衰弱。美国占领着日本，把日本变为自己的殖民地和侵略亚洲的基地，这不能不唤起日本人民和亚洲各国人民对美帝国主义的反抗。美国破坏开城谈判和召集片面的对日和会，表示了美帝国主义的穷凶极恶。但是中朝人民加紧斗争，并且和世界各国人民联合一致，一定能够粉碎美国的疯狂侵略，得到最后胜利。
