　　Resolutely Eliminate Feudal Ideas that Discriminate Against Women!
    Many Readers of This Newspaper Sent Letters Criticizing Lin Hong's Opinion
    Editor's Note: On August 1st, the "Reader's Letters" column of this newspaper published reader Lin Hong's letter opposing the "Notice on Abolishing the Provision of 'Not Accepting Pregnant Women' in the Recruitment of Staff and Trainees" issued by the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government, as well as the All-China Democratic Women's Federation's reply to Lin Hong. As of August 26th, we have received letters from six organizations and two hundred and seventy readers, expressing their opinions on this matter; everyone unanimously supports the notice of the Ministry of Personnel, agrees with the reply of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and has criticized Lin Hong's opinion. What is published in this column today is a part of the incoming letters.
  (1) Comrade Editor:
    After reading Lin Hong's letter and the All-China Women's Federation's reply in the "Reader's Letters" column of the August 1st People's Daily, the comrades of this association conducted discussions. We unanimously and firmly support the "Notice on Abolishing the Provision of 'Not Accepting Pregnant Women' in the Recruitment of Staff and Trainees" issued by the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government, and agree with the reply of the All-China Women's Federation. We believe that Lin Hong's opinion is completely wrong.
    The revolutionary cause of the Chinese people has achieved great victory, and the people of the whole country are working hard to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and carry out national construction, in order to strive for the future of socialism and communism, thereby liberating all mankind and the whole society. Women account for half of the population, and to liberate society, women must be liberated. The key to women's liberation lies in women's equal participation with men in labor production and political and social activities. Therefore, anyone who advocates social liberation and truly respects and protects women will inevitably encourage and help women (including pregnant women) to participate in production labor and various work and studies. Only those with feudal remnant ideas that discriminate against women will (regardless of any pretext) take the opposite attitude.
    Women giving birth to children is a contribution to society. The rest before and after childbirth for women in production and work positions is a treatment she deserves, and is by no means a loss to any agency or department or a waste of national funds. Agencies and organizations under the leadership of the people's democratic regime only have the obligation to welcome and care for pregnant women, and have no right to discriminate against or reject them. Married young and middle-aged women will always have children. Whether pregnancy and childbirth occur during the application process, or while studying or working, is just a matter of timing. There has never been a case of rejecting pregnant women when recruiting staff or trainees, while being able to adopt a truly welcoming and helpful attitude towards pregnant women who are already employed or studying.
    Facts have proved that women can work during the rest of their pregnancy, except for two months before and after childbirth. Appropriate work and labor not only does not hinder the health of pregnant women, but also helps the health of pregnant women and the development of the fetus. Using "respect for women and protection of women" as a "reason" to reject pregnant women is obviously unfounded.
    Lin Hong does not treat the issue of recruiting pregnant women from the perspective of social liberation and women's liberation, nor from the social significance of women having children, and opposes the temporary and partial interests of individual institutions and schools to the long-term interests of society. Despite the fact that he is using the banner of "respecting women and protecting women," the essence of his opinion reflects feudal remnant ideology and a one-sided and narrow way of thinking.
    We hope that all agencies and organizations in Beijing (especially female cadres) will launch discussions on this issue, and through this discussion, assist the personnel departments of each agency and organization to seriously examine their attitude towards pregnant women, in order to further clarify feudal remnant ideas and ensure the implementation of this notice from the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government.
        Beijing Democratic Women's Federation
  (2) Comrade Editor:
    After reading reader Lin Hong's opinion on the issue of not accepting pregnant women and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation's reply in the "Reader's Letters" column of the August 1st People's Daily, our Beijing Women's Friendship Association's study groups attached great importance to this issue and organized discussions separately. On August 7th, more than 30 cadres above the group leader level of this association conducted a forum on this issue. Everyone unanimously believed that Lin Hong's opinion was completely wrong.
    Lin Hong said: We should specifically understand equality between men and women from the differences between men and women. We know that there is no difference between men and women except for physiological differences. And children are our country's most valuable assets. Women giving birth to children is undoubtedly a great contribution to the country. If women are deprived of the right to participate in learning or work on the grounds of pregnancy, it is obviously contrary to the principle of equality between men and women.
    Lin Hong believes that recruiting pregnant women to participate in work or study is equivalent to recruiting a staff member or trainee in vain, which will waste state expenditure. This only sees the small interests of one's own work department, while ignoring the serious consequences of "not accepting pregnant women." Chinese women have made great contributions to the revolutionary cause; women must actively participate in the construction of the motherland. The political consciousness of the women's masses in New China has been greatly improved. They are unwilling to live a parasitic life and are eager to study and work, to serve the people, and to strive for their own liberation. If pregnancy is seen as an obstacle for women to participate in work and study, it is equivalent to saying that marriage will inevitably hinder women's progress, because women will always become pregnant after marriage. This is obviously absurd.
    Women's liberation is a sign of social liberation. Without the participation of women, who account for half of humanity, the liberation cause of all mankind cannot be successfully completed. Therefore, "not accepting pregnant women" hinders women's progress and will have serious consequences. Lin Hong actually considers the unreasonable provision of "not accepting pregnant women" as a way to respect and protect women, which is a serious mistake.

    The "Notice on Abolishing the Provision of 'Not Accepting Pregnant Women' in the Recruitment of Staff and Trainees" issued by the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government is one of the important measures to implement Article 6 of the Common Program, which is to abolish the feudal system that binds women. Reader Lin Hong's opinion is completely wrong. In addition to agreeing with the All-China Democratic Women's Federation's reply to Lin Hong, I have a few additional comments.
    Lin Hong believes that equality between men and women should be specifically understood from the differences between men and women. Men and women have physiological differences, and women's childbearing is precisely where the difference lies. Women's childbearing is a contribution to society. Can they therefore be deprived of their political, economic, cultural, and social rights, and still talk about equality between men and women? On the contrary, only by giving pregnant women and childbirth the due protection (as stipulated in the labor insurance regulations and the Ministry of Personnel's notice) can we truly "specifically understand equality between men and women" from the "differences between men and women."
    Lin Hong puts forward the "short time distance from discovering pregnancy to needing rest" as a reason to defend "not accepting pregnant women." This reason is untenable. Generally speaking, mothers only need to rest for fifty-six to sixty days before and after childbirth, and can work and study as usual at other times. For example, female workers in factories work as usual except for the fifty-six days of maternity leave. The Soviet Union is a country that pays special attention to the protection of mothers, and maternity leave is only seventy-seven days; moreover, Soviet law stipulates that anyone who refuses to employ women or reduces women's wages on the grounds of pregnancy shall be held criminally liable.
    Is recruiting pregnant women in institutions and schools "equivalent to recruiting a staff member in vain" or "letting her study for a period of time in vain," and thus wasting the "legitimate expenditure" of "national funds"? Not at all. The "interruption" during the leave period of pregnant women in study or work can be compensated for in various ways. In the era of the people being masters of their own affairs, the money spent by the state to protect pregnant women is a legitimate expenditure. Therefore, I believe that it is not the Ministry of Personnel's notice that should be cancelled, but rather Lin Hong's discriminatory view of women that must be eliminated.

  (4) Comrade Editor:
    After seeing reader Lin Hong's letter, I realized that I also had similar wrong ideas in the past. Now I will combine criticizing my past wrong understandings and express some opinions on this issue.
    I work in the personnel department of a cultural and educational institution. After seeing the "Notice on Abolishing the Provision of 'Not Accepting Pregnant Women' in the Recruitment of Staff and Trainees" issued by the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government, I couldn't quite understand it ideologically. Like Lin Hong, I also thought that absorbing pregnant women to work would be equivalent to recruiting a staff member in vain during this period? And "not accepting pregnant women" is not only beneficial to work, but also takes care of the legitimate expenditure of national funds. And I also mistakenly thought: The Ministry of Personnel abolished the provision of "not accepting pregnant women," but when we recruit staff, we allow pregnant women to take the exam, but do not hire them. This both "does not violate the policy" and achieves the purpose of "not accepting pregnant women."
    I conducted an inspection on this issue and found that this idea of mine is a manifestation of feudal remnant ideas that discriminate against women, and has very deep social roots. I was born in a landlord family. I was pampered and spoiled by my parents since I was a child, and neither of my two older sisters were "valued" as much as I was. I also often saw relatives and neighbors say "great joy" when they gave birth to boys, and held a lively "reception and acceptance of gifts"; they felt unhappy when they gave birth to girls, and some fierce mothers-in-law would scold their daughters-in-law for being "useless." Later, when I went to school, I was also subjected to some feudal education. All of these created my deeply ingrained feudal ideas of belittling women. After liberation, I joined the work force, and under the education of the Party and the People's Government, I made great progress and gloriously joined the Communist Youth League. But this feudal consciousness of belittling women has not been criticized. So I did not understand the Ministry of Personnel's notice to abolish the provision of "not accepting pregnant women" at the beginning. Now I realize that this idea is extremely wrong and must be cleared away. I guarantee to conscientiously implement this notice.

### 坚决肃清歧视妇女的封建思想！本报很多读者来信批判林红的意见

专栏：读者来信

　　坚决肃清歧视妇女的封建思想！
    本报很多读者来信批判林红的意见
    编者按：八月一日，本报读者来信栏发表了读者林红反对中央人民政府人事部“关于废除招考工作人员及学员时‘不收孕妇’规定的通知”的来信以及中华全国民主妇女联合会对林红的答复。到八月二十六日为止，我们已收到六个团体和二百七十个读者来信，对这件事发表意见；大家一致拥护人事部的通知，同意中华全国民主妇女联合会的答复，并对林红的意见进行了批判。今天本栏所登的是来信中的一部分。
  （一）编辑同志：
    读了八月一日人民日报《读者来信》栏林红的来信和全国妇联的答复后，本会同志曾进行了讨论。我们一致坚决拥护中央人民政府人事部“关于废除招考工作人员及学员时‘不收孕妇’规定的通知”，并同意全国妇联的答复。我们认为：林红的意见，是完全错误的。
    中国人民的革命事业已取得伟大的胜利，全国人民正在为巩固人民民主专政，进行国家建设而努力，以争取社会主义与共产主义的前途，从而解放全人类，全社会。妇女占人口的一半，要解放社会必须解放妇女。而妇女解放的关键在于妇女与男子平等地参加劳动生产和政治、社会活动。因此，凡是主张社会解放并真正尊重妇女、保护妇女的人，必然鼓励和帮助妇女（包括孕妇）参加生产劳动以及各种工作和学习。只有有着歧视妇女的封建残余思想的人，才会（不管在任何借口之下）采取相反的态度。
    妇女生孩子是对社会的贡献。在生产和工作岗位上的妇女生孩子前后的休息，是她应得的待遇，而决不是任何机关部门的损失或国家经费的浪费。在人民民主政权领导下的机关和团体，对于怀孕妇女只有欢迎、照顾的义务，没有歧视、拒绝的权利。已婚的青壮年妇女总是要生孩子的。在投考时，或在学习、工作岗位上怀孕、生孩子是一个问题，不同的只是时间先后而已。未有在招考工作人员或学员时拒收孕妇，而能对在职在学的孕妇采取真正欢迎和帮助的态度的。
    事实证明：妇女除在生产前后两个月需要休息外，其余怀孕时期是可以工作的。适当的工作和劳动，不但不妨碍孕妇健康，却正有助于孕妇的健康和胎儿的发育。拿“尊重妇女和保护妇女”作为拒收孕妇的“理由”，显然是没有根据的。
    林红不从社会解放与妇女解放出发，不从妇女生小孩的社会意义出发，来对待招收孕妇的问题，并且把个别机关学校暂时的、局部的利益和社会的长远利益对立起来。尽管他打的是“尊重妇女、保护妇女”的招牌，但实质上他的意见是反映了封建残余的思想意识和片面狭隘的思想方法。
    我们希望北京市各机关团体（特别是女干部）对这问题展开讨论，并通过这次讨论，协助各该机关团体的人事部门认真检查对待孕妇的态度，以便进一步澄清封建残余思想，保证中央人民政府人事部这一通知的贯彻实现。
        北京市民主妇女联合会
  （二）编辑同志：
    读了八月一日人民日报《读者来信》栏所载读者林红关于不收孕妇问题的意见，及中华全国民主妇女联合会的答复后，我们北京妇女联谊会各学习小组都很重视这个问题，分别组织了讨论。八月七日，本会小组长以上干部三十余人，对这问题进行了座谈。大家一致认为林红的意见是完全错误的。
    林红说：应该从男女的差别上来具体认识男女平等。我们知道，男女除了生理上的差别外，再没有任何差别。而孩子是我们国家最宝贵的财产。妇女生孩子无疑是对国家的巨大贡献。若以妇女怀孕为理由，而剥夺妇女参加学习或工作的权利，显然是有背于男女平等的原则。
    林红认为招收孕妇参加工作或学习，就等于白招收了一个工作人员或学员，会浪费国家的开支。这是只看到了本工作部门一点小利益，而忽略了“不收孕妇”的严重恶果。中国妇女在革命事业中曾经有很大的贡献；祖国建设事业中，还必须妇女积极参加。新中国的妇女群众政治觉悟已大大提高，不愿再过寄生生活，都迫切地要求学习和工作，要求为人民服务，并争取自己的解放。如果把怀孕看成为妇女参加工作和学习的障碍，那就等于说结婚势必妨碍妇女进步，因为妇女在结婚后总是要怀孕的。这显然是荒谬的。
    妇女解放是社会解放的标志，没有占人类半数的妇女参加斗争，全人类的解放事业是不能胜利完成的。因此，“不收孕妇”是阻碍妇女进步的，会造成严重的后果。林红竟将“不收孕妇”这一不合理的规定认为是为了尊重妇女、保护妇女，这是一个严重的错误。

    中央人民政府人事部“关于废除招考工作人员及学员时‘不收孕妇’规定的通知”，是实现共同纲领第六条废除束缚妇女的封建制度的重要措施之一。读者林红的意见是完全错误的。我除了同意中华全国民主妇女联合会对林红的答复外，还有几点补充意见。
    林红认为应从男女的差别上来具体认识男女平等。男女有生理上的差别，而妇女生育正是差别之所在。妇女生育是对社会的贡献，难道因此而剥夺其在政治上、经济上、文化上以及社会生活各方面的权利，还谈得上男女平等吗？相反，只有对妇女的怀孕和生育给予应有的保护（如劳动保险条例及人事部通知中所规定的），才是真正“从男女差别”上来具体认识男女平等。
    林红提出“发觉怀孕到需要静养这时间距离很短”作理由为“不收孕妇”辩护，这理由是不能成立的。一般说，产妇在生产前后只需要休息五十六天到六十天，此外时间，一样可以工作学习。如工厂女工除五十六天产假外，都是照常工作。苏联是对保护母亲特别注意的国家，产假也仅有七十七天；而且苏联法律规定：凡以怀孕为理由，而拒绝雇佣妇女工作，或以同样理由减低妇女工资的人，应负刑事责任。
    机关学校中招收了孕妇，是不是“等于白招收了一个工作人员”或“让她白学了一段”，因而浪费“国家经费”的“正当开支”呢？丝毫都不是。孕妇在学习或工作中休假期间中的“间歇”，是可以用各种办法来弥补的。在人民当家作主的时代，国家为保护孕妇而支出的钱，是正当开支。因此，我认为：不是人事部的通知要取消，而恰恰是林红这种歧视妇女的观点必须肃清。

  （四）编辑同志：
    看到读者林红来信后，我发觉自己过去也有着类似的错误思想。现在我结合批判自己过去的错误认识，对这一问题发表一些意见。
    我在一个文教机关里做人事工作。看到中央人民政府人事部“关于废除招收工作人员及学员时‘不收孕妇’规定的通知”后，我思想上有些打不通。我也像林红一样，认为吸收孕妇来工作，岂不是等于在这一时期内白招收了一个工作人员？而“不收孕妇”，不但对工作有利，而且也照顾到国家经费的正当开支。并且我还错误地想过：人事部废除了“不收孕妇”规定，但我们在招收工作人员时准孕妇考试，但不予录取，这既“不违犯政策”，也达到了“不收孕妇”的目的。
    我针对这一问题进行了一次检查，发觉自己这种想法是歧视妇女的封建残余思想的表现，并且是有很深的社会根源的。我出生在一个地主家庭里，从小被父母宠爱，娇生惯养，而两个姐姐都没有像我那样受“重视”。我还经常见到亲戚邻居生男孩时就说是“大喜”，而且“待客纳礼”热闹一番；生了女孩就觉得不高兴，有些厉害的婆婆还要骂媳妇“没用”。后来上学读书时，又受到一些封建教育，这些都造成自己根深蒂固的轻视妇女的封建思想。解放后，我参加了工作，在党及人民政府的教育下，有了很大的进步，并且光荣地参加了青年团。但这种轻视妇女的封建意识仍没有受到批判。所以我对人事部废除“不收孕妇”规定的通知，开始是不了解的。现在我认识到这想法是极端错误的，必须清除。我保证认真执行这个通知。
