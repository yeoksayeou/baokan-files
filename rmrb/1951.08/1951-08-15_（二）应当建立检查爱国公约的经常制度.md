　　(II) A Regular System for Inspecting Patriotic Pledges Should Be Established

　　Various localities are currently inspecting patriotic pledges. This inspection is highly necessary to understand the implementation of patriotic pledges and to summarize the experiences of the patriotic pledge movement. Using the method of signing patriotic pledges to mobilize and organize the masses to actively carry out various patriotic tasks is a long-term task for our country, so the inspection of patriotic pledges must also be carried out regularly. Existing experience has proven that regular inspections are the key to ensuring the complete realization of patriotic pledges. In this inspection of patriotic pledges in various localities, it was discovered that many patriotic pledges were merely formalities and did not play a role. One of the reasons for this formalism is the lack of regular leadership and inspection of patriotic pledges, which has led to the patriotic pledge movement becoming a laissez-faire state.

　　In order to conduct regular inspections of patriotic pledges, it is necessary to establish permanent leadership cores. In all units that have signed patriotic pledges, such as factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, streets, and rural areas, as well as in workshops, production teams, and study groups in factories, departments in institutions, departments or classes and groups in schools, and even in individual families and other production and work units, leaders should be selected to establish this permanent leadership core. In places where there are sub- or branch committees of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, these sub- or branch committees can be responsible for leading and inspecting the work of patriotic pledges. The grassroots organizations of the Communist Party, the Communist Youth League, trade unions, and peasant associations in various units must actively participate in this leadership and inspection work. The June 1st notice of the National Resist America, Aid Korea Headquarters stipulated that a nationwide inspection of patriotic pledges will be held again in January next year. However, smaller units that have signed pledges should conduct more inspections, preferably once a month. The results of the inspection should be announced to the masses, the good ones praised, and the bad ones criticized. If, during the inspection, it is found that the content of the patriotic pledge is impractical, or if the actual situation has changed, the content of the patriotic pledge should be appropriately revised to make it easier to implement.

　　In the past, many places have established regular inspection systems for patriotic pledges, and these inspection systems have played a positive role in ensuring the realization of patriotic pledges. For example, the Jiang'an section of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's trade union has established a system of inspecting patriotic pledges twice a month, and also conducts spot checks. The results of the inspections are announced on blackboards and big-character posters. The delivery group of the Tianjin Postal Administration has established a "Personal Work Registration Card" system for inspecting patriotic pledges, where each person fills in the number of jobs they have completed, errors, etc., on the card every day, and holds a review meeting once a week based on the card. The He Yongzhang team of the Nanjing Radio Factory created a "Five-Person Promotion and Inspection Team" to carry out division of labor and inspection of the implementation of patriotic pledges. The Xixiang Hutong in Beijing implemented a "Resist America, Aid Korea Day" system, that is, gathering once every Saturday evening to inspect patriotic pledges and carry out patriotic propaganda and education work such as talking about current affairs and reading newspapers. These methods can be referenced by various localities.

　　（二）应当建立检查爱国公约的经常制度
    各地现在都在检查爱国公约。为着了解爱国公约的执行情形，总结爱国公约运动的经验，这种检查是十分必要的。以订立爱国公约的方式，去发动和组织人民群众积极地进行各项爱国工作，这是我们国家的一件长期性的工作，所以对爱国公约的检查也必须经常地进行。已有的经验证明，经常地进行检查，这是保证爱国公约能够完满实现的关键。这次各地在检查爱国公约中，发现不少爱国公约徒具形式，不起作用。产生这种形式主义现象的原因之一，就是对爱国公约缺乏经常的领导和检查，以致使爱国公约运动形成自流状态。
    为了经常进行对爱国公约的检查，就必须建立经常的领导核心。在所有订立爱国公约的单位，如工厂、企业、机关、学校、街道以及农村，工厂中的各个车间、生产组、学习组，机关中的各工作部门，学校中的各院系或班、组，以至各个家庭和其他各种生产、工作单位中，都应选出领导人，建立这种经常的领导核心。在有抗美援朝分、支会的地方，可由这些分、支会负担领导和检查爱国公约的工作。各单位的共产党、青年团、工会以及农会的基层组织都必须积极参加这种领导及检查工作。抗美援朝总会六月一日通知中已规定对爱国公约的全国范围的大检查将于明年一月再举行一次。但订约的小单位应该更多地进行检查，最好能每月检查一次。检查的结果应向群众公布，好的表扬，坏的批评。在检查中如发现爱国公约的内容有不切实际的地方，或在实际情况已有变化的情形下，应适当地修订爱国公约的内容，使它更便于实行。
    在过去一个时候，有不少地方已建立起对爱国公约的经常检查制度，这些检查制度，对于保证爱国公约的实现都起了积极作用。例如郑州铁路局江岸段工会已建立了对爱国公约每月两次的检查制度，此外并进行抽查，检查的结果都在黑板报及大字报上公布。天津邮政管理局投递组已建立了检查爱国公约的“个人工作登记卡片”制度，每人每天把自己作业的数量、差错等填在卡片上，每周根据卡片开检讨会一次。南京市有线电厂贺咏璋小组，创立了“五人推动检查小组”，对爱国公约执行情况实行分工检查。北京市的西巷胡同实行了“抗美援朝日”制度，即在每个星期六晚上集会一次，检查爱国公约，并进行讲时事、读报等爱国主义的宣传教育工作。这些办法，各地都可参考。
