　　Overcoming Formalism in the Patriotic Pact Movement
　　Pan Lin
    Currently, many production, work, and study units and families in some regions have established patriotic pacts. For example, about 80% of factories, rural areas, government offices, and schools in Hebei Province have established patriotic pacts. Regarding the number of people from all walks of life in cities who have established patriotic pacts: in Beijing, it accounts for about 70% of the city's population; in Nanjing, 60%; in Qingdao, 60% to 70%; in Ganzhou and Shangrao, 90%; and in two districts of Xi'an, the number of signatories accounts for about 85% of the total population. The number of rural residents who have established patriotic pacts: in several special districts of Fujian, it accounts for 60% of the rural areas in the district; in Fuyang County, northern Anhui, 70%; in Cangshan County, Shandong, 70%; in Xi'an County, eastern Liaoning, 80%; in Tongliao County, Inner Mongolia, 60% to 70%; and in Chang'an County, Shaanxi, 64%. Regarding the establishment of family patriotic pacts: Xinxing Township in Guanghan County, western Sichuan, accounts for over 90% of the households in the township; Fuyu Township in the suburbs of Fuzhou, 95%; and the third district of Jinning County, Yunnan, reaches 100%. In Nanchong City, northern Sichuan, it accounts for 95% of the city's residents' households; residents of seven lanes in Derun Road, Tilanqiao District, Shanghai, have universally established family patriotic pacts. From these figures, it can be seen that the patriotic pact movement has been launched among the majority of the people in some regions. In many places and units, the patriotic pacts have been established relatively well, playing a significant role in promoting production, learning, and work.
    However, on the other hand, the results of inspections of patriotic pacts in many regions have proven that in many places, this movement has not been universally launched, and many regions and units that have already established patriotic pacts still have serious problems of formalism. For example, 40% to 50% of workers in Shanghai's industrial systems have not yet established patriotic pacts; of those who have, taking the employee union system as an example, out of 950 patriotic pacts that were inspected, 600 were empty and not specific. In the Northeast's Lushun-Dalian Municipality, an inspection of sixteen units (including factories, seaports, urban districts, etc.)' patriotic pacts revealed that the pacts of thirteen units were empty. The Huanggu Tun Inspection Section of Shenyang City found that all the patriotic pacts of the section's four workshops and twenty-three production groups were ineffective. In Heilongjiang's Zhaodong, five of the seven state-owned factories' patriotic pacts were nominal and merely for show. In Baiquan Village, Changping County, Hebei, 70% of the farmers' patriotic pacts were empty in content, and the remaining 30% were not implemented. In the patriotic pacts of fifty-one villages in the second, fourth, and fifth districts of Huanren County, eastern Liaoning, about 73% were ineffective. The patriotic pacts of residents in the fourth district of Wuhan City were generally ineffective. Similar situations exist in many other regions. This shows that the phenomenon of formalism in the patriotic pact movement is quite serious.
    All ineffective patriotic pacts can be roughly categorized into the following three types:
    The first type: The content of the pacts is unrealistic, blindly copying and transferring without adapting to local conditions, making them impossible to implement. For example, a bus station in Xianghe County, Hebei, posted the patriotic pact of the medical field on its door; a barbershop and a coffin shop in Lutai Town also wrote "develop production and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas" on their patriotic pacts; a certain vendor in Yangliuqing Town, who did not plant cotton at all, also wrote "guarantee six hoeings of cotton fields"; some villages in Ninghe County without any workers wrote "workers launch production competitions"; and villages without military dependents wrote "guarantee that the land of military dependents will not be barren." The Second Complete Primary School in Daye, Hubei, even included clauses in its pact such as "guarantee to pay taxes on time and not falsely report capital." The Beitang Railway Station in Tianjin has never signed a collective contract, but its pact included the clause "implement collective contracts." Similar phenomena also exist in some units in Shanxi, Shanghai, Nanjing, southern Jiangsu, western Liaoning, and Qinghai.
    The second type: The content of the pacts only vaguely stipulates some general political slogans without linking them to the specific work of the masses in the contracting units, thus making it impossible to implement them concretely. For example, the patriotic pact of a train crew under the Tianjin Locomotive Depot of the Tianjin Railway Union consists only of clauses such as responding to the call of higher authorities, abiding by revolutionary order, and supporting government decrees. The patriotic pacts of workers at the Yangxin Chengguan Wharf in Hubei, apart from the clause "uphold wharf order," are all about "supporting the World Peace Council" and "opposing US imperialism with practical actions." On the other hand, some patriotic pacts only contain production content without any political content, which is also incorrect. The patriotic pacts of farmers in Shiji Township, Chu County, northern Anhui, are mostly trivial family matters such as pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese, without any political content. Patriotic pacts of this type are numerous.
    The third type: There are too many clauses and the content is too complicated, making it impossible for the signatories to remember them, thus making it impossible to guarantee their implementation. For example, the patriotic pact in Shawa Township, Echeng, Hubei, had as many as forty-one clauses of various sizes. The masses reflected: "Remembering this clause, forgetting that clause, it's really verbose." Some groups in the East Third Pit of Taixin Coal Mine in Xi'an included everything from the dormitory to the mine entrance, going to and from work, studying, paying membership fees, and carrying safety lamps in their pacts. Workers said: "There are too many conditions and no central goal." Some classes in Guangya Middle School in Guangzhou even had as many as fifty or sixty patriotic pact clauses.
    According to inspections in various regions, the main reasons for the above shortcomings are that some leading organs and working cadres do not fully understand the political significance of patriotic pacts, and thus adopt a perfunctory attitude towards the patriotic pact movement. Some cadres, due to a lack of mass perspective, do not mobilize the masses and rely on the masses' consciousness to establish patriotic pacts, but instead adopt the methods of paternalistic substitution and coercion to promote the patriotic pact movement.
    According to the experience gained in this inspection in various regions, the following three points are worth noting in order to correct and prevent the problem of formalism in patriotic pacts:
    First, the establishment, implementation, inspection, and revision of patriotic pacts must be based on in-depth patriotic ideological education so that working cadres, activists among the masses, and all signatories understand the meaning and method of establishing patriotic pacts. Yutai Inn Alley in Tianjin has provided good experience in this regard. In the past, the patriotic pacts established by residents of Yutai Inn Alley were not effectively implemented because there was no sufficient publicity and education, and everyone was unclear about the usefulness of the pacts and did not know how to establish them. The initial patriotic pacts were either established by activists on behalf of others or copied from each other. During the inspection of patriotic pacts in July, the Anti-US and Aid-Korea sub-branch of the district first convened a forum of activists to make them understand the significance of establishing patriotic pacts and how to establish them. After the activists returned, they convened a neighborhood meeting to explain that establishing patriotic pacts is beneficial to both the country and individuals; and further pointed out: Establishing a patriotic pact is to set a specific patriotic action goal for oneself. The reason why it was not well implemented in the past was because it was not specific enough. In the future, it must be established in a solid and realistic manner, and what is said must be done. After the neighborhood meeting, a review meeting was held in groups based on courtyards. At the meeting, many people reviewed their patriotic pacts. Li, an old lady in her sixties, said: "In the past, I didn't understand what a pact was, but now I finally have a little understanding." Everyone felt during the discussion that to make the patriotic pacts practical and concrete and to ensure their implementation, it was necessary to go back and discuss them with everyone in the family and not be paternalistic. After such a series of publicity and discussions, the pacts of each family were revised to be more specific. For example, "supporting world peace" was changed to "saving expenses and guaranteeing monthly donations to buy planes and cannons"; some changed "supporting the government's suppression of counter-revolutionaries" to "investigating rumors and not hiding bad people."
    Second, in terms of the method of establishing and revising patriotic pacts, the content of the patriotic pacts must be determined with a focus on grassroots production units, work, study, and living units, or households. During this inspection, it was found in various regions that many patriotic pacts established with a larger scope as the unit were relatively empty. For example, the common patriotic pact adopted by the entire village of Xixu Village, Yancheng, northern Jiangsu, was found in this inspection to have played a certain role, but its content was mostly generalized slogans and could not suit the specific circumstances of each household, resulting in some clauses being unfulfilled. The patriotic pacts established by the entire village of Xianfeng Village, Tongliao, Inner Mongolia, based on mutual aid groups, citizen groups, and administrative groups, were relatively specific, so their effect was also great, greatly promoting donations of planes and cannons and preferential treatment work.
    Third, after a patriotic pact is established, leaders must be selected and a regular inspection system must be established to ensure its implementation. In this regard, various regions have some good experiences. For example, the inspection system of the First Branch of the Northeast Chemical Tannery is: in the workshop, the inspection team consists of propagandists, technicians, team leaders, and worker representatives of the group, and conducts inspections and evaluations once a week. The factory side is composed of the inspection committee composed of cadres of the CCP committee and administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, and regularly conducts spot checks. Summarize and publicize the implementation of the patriotic pacts of each workshop once a month, and conduct rewards and criticisms. Some factories in Nanjing designate two inspectors to be responsible for statistics, supervision, and inspection; some residential sections in the city mobilize the masses to inspect each other, record good and bad examples at any time, hold regular meetings, and report to the inspection committee to see which group implements the pact best. This also plays a certain supervisory role. Only by conducting regular inspections can the implementation of the patriotic pact be guaranteed.

　　克服爱国公约运动中的形式主义
    潘林
    目前，有些地区已有许多生产、工作、学习的单位和家庭订立了爱国公约。例如：河北全省约有百分之八十的工厂、农村、机关、学校订立了爱国公约。城市各界人民订立爱国公约的人数，北京市约占全市人口的百分之七十，南京市占百分之六十，青岛市占百分之六十到七十，赣州市、上饶市均占百分之九十，西安市两个区的统计，订约者约占全部人口百分之八十五。乡村居民订立爱国公约的人数，福建若干专区均占本区乡村百分之六十，皖北阜阳县占本县乡村百分之七十，山东苍山县占百分之七十，辽东西安县占百分之八十，内蒙通辽县占百分之六十到七十，陕西长安县占百分之六十四。订立家庭爱国公约的：川西广汉县新兴乡占该乡户数百分之九十以上，福州市郊复屿乡占百分之九十五，云南晋宁县第三区达百分之百。川北南充市占该市居民户数的百分之九十五，上海市提篮桥区内德润路七条里弄的居民普遍订了家庭爱国公约。从这些数字上可以看出，爱国公约运动在若干地区的大部分人民群众中已经展开了。有不少地方及单位的爱国公约订立得比较好，对生产、学习、工作等都起了很大的推动作用。
    但是另一方面许多地区检查爱国公约的结果证明：在许多地方这一运动还没有普遍展开，而且不少地区和单位已经订立的爱国公约还存在着严重的形式主义的毛病。例如：上海各产业系统的工人，还有百分之四十到五十尚未订立爱国公约；已经订的，举店员工会系统为例，九百五十个受了检查的爱国公约，内容空洞而不具体的就有六百个。东北旅大市检查十六个单位（包括工厂、海港、市区等）的爱国公约，发现有十三个单位的公约是空洞的。沈阳市皇姑屯检车段全段四个车间、二十三个生产小组的爱国公约全部不起作用。黑龙江肇东七个国营工厂的爱国公约有五个工厂是有名无实、徒具形式的。河北昌平县柏泉庄农民的爱国公约有百分之七十内容空洞，其余百分之三十也没有执行。辽东桓仁县二、四、五三个区五十一个村的爱国公约中约有百分之七十三不起作用。武汉市第四区居民的爱国公约普遍不起作用。其他许多地区也有类似情况。这说明了爱国公约运动中的形式主义现象是相当严重的。
    所有不起作用的爱国公约，概括起来大致有以下三种类型：
    第一种：公约内容不切实际，盲目地硬搬硬套、照抄照转，根本不能执行。如河北香河县一个汽车站把医药界的爱国公约贴在自己门上，芦台镇理发店、棺材铺的爱国公约上也写着“发展生产，沟通城乡物资交流”，杨柳青镇某商贩根本没有种棉花，也写着“保证棉田锄六遍”，宁河县某些没有工人的村庄，写着“工人开展生产竞赛”，没有军属的村，写着“保证军属土地不荒”。湖北大冶八区第二完全小学竟在公约上订出“保证按期缴税，不虚报资本”的条文。天津北塘车站从来没有订过集体合同，而公约中竟订出“贯彻集体合同”的条文。山西、上海、南京、苏南、辽西、青海等地区某些单位也有类似的现象。
    第二种：公约内容只空洞地规定一些一般性的政治口号，而没有使与订约单位群众的具体业务结合起来，因此而无法具体执行。如天津铁路工会所属天津机务段某包车组的爱国公约，都是些响应上级号召、遵守革命秩序、拥护政府法令等条文。湖北阳新城关码头工人订立的爱国公约中，除“拥护码头秩序”一条外，其余都是“拥护和平理事会”、“以实际行动反对美帝国主义”等。另一方面，有些爱国公约又只有生产内容，而无政治内容，这也是不对的。皖北滁县施集乡农民的爱国公约大都是家庭琐事，如猪、鸡、鸭、鹅等，没有一点政治内容。属于这一类型的爱国公约为数很多。
    第三种：条文太多，内容复杂，订约者记不住，因此当然无法保证执行。如湖北鄂城沙窝乡的爱国公约大大小小订了四十一条。群众反映说：“记住这条忘记了那条，真啰嗦。”西安市泰信煤矿东三坑部分小组把从宿舍到入井，上下班，学习，交会费，带安全灯等都订在公约内。工友说：“条件太多，没中心目标。”广州市广雅中学有些班的爱国公约竟多至五、六十条。
    根据各地检查，产生以上缺点的主要原因，是某些领导机关和工作干部对于爱国公约的政治意义认识不足，因而对爱国公约运动采取了敷衍的态度。有些干部由于缺乏群众观点，不去发动群众，依靠群众的自觉去订立爱国公约，反而采取包办代替和强迫命令的方式去推行爱国公约运动。
    根据各地在这次检查中所获得的经验，要纠正和防止爱国公约中的形式主义的毛病，下面这三点是值得注意的：
    第一，爱国公约的订立，执行和检查修订，必须以深入的爱国主义的思想教育为基础，使工作干部、群众中的积极分子和所有订约者都明了订立爱国公约的意义和方法。天津市玉泰栈胡同在这方面提供了很好的经验。玉泰栈胡同居民过去订的爱国公约，因为没有经过充分的宣传教育，大家弄不清公约有什么用，也不知道怎样订，开始所订的爱国公约，有的是积极分子代订的，有的是互相抄袭的，因而使全胡同三十六户的爱国公约都不能很好地贯彻执行。七月间检查爱国公约时，该区抗美援朝支分会首先召集了积极分子座谈会，使他们都了解订爱国公约的意义和怎样订法。积极分子回去后，就召开了全胡同的片会，说明爱国公约对国家对个人都有好处；并进一步指出：订立爱国公约是为自己立下一个爱国的具体行动目标，过去订了没有很好执行，是因为不具体，今后一定要订得实实在在，说到做到。片会结束，接着就以院为单位分组开检讨会。会上，很多人对自己的爱国公约都作了检查。六十多岁的李老太太说：“过去咱就不明嘛是公约，这才算有点底了。”大家在讨论时都感到要把爱国公约订得切实体具，并保证做到，需要回去和家里的每一个人讨论，不能包办。经过这样一系列的宣传讨论，各家的公约都修改得比较具体了。如“拥护世界和平”都改成“节省用费，保证每月捐钱购买飞机大炮”；有的把“拥护政府镇压反革命”改成“听了谣言要追根，不藏坏人”。
    第二，在订立、修正爱国公约的方法上，必须以基层生产单位，工作、学习、生活单位或户为重点来确定爱国公约的内容。各地在这次检查中发现有许多以较大范围为单位订立的爱国公约都比较空洞。如苏北盐城西徐村全村通过共同的爱国公约，在这次检查时发现虽然也起了一定的作用，但内容多属一般化的口号，不能适合每户的具体情况，致使有些条文落了空。内蒙通辽先锋村全村以互助组、公民组、行政组为单位订立的爱国公约，因比较具体，所以作用也就大，对捐献飞机大炮和优抚工作都起了很大的推动作用。
    第三，爱国公约订立后，必须选出领导人，建立经常的检查制度，才能保证执行。在这方面，各地都有一些好经验。例如东北化学制革厂一分厂的检查制度是：在车间，由宣传员、技师、班组长、小组工人代表组成检查小组，每周进行一次检查、评定。厂方即由中共党委和行政、工会、青年团的干部组成检查委员会，经常进行抽查。每月总结和公布一次各车间执行爱国公约的情况，并进行奖励和批评。南京市有的工厂小组推定两位检查员经常负责统计、督促和检查工作；该市有的居民段发动群众互相检查，把好坏例子随时记下，定期开会，向检查委员会汇报，看那个组执行公约最好。这样也起了一定的督促作用。只有经常进行检查，才能保证爱国公约的贯彻执行。
