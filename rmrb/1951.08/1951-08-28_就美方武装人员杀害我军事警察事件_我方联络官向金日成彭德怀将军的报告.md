Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 27th.

　　On the morning of August 19th, more than 30 armed personnel of the United Nations forces illegally infiltrated the Kaesong Neutral Zone. At 5:55 AM, near the crossroads between Songgok-ri and Bapsan-ri, they ambushed our military police, who were patrolling the area in accordance with the agreement, murdering Yao Qingxiang, the platoon leader of our military police, and seriously injuring soldier Wang Renyuan. On the same day, General Nam Il, the chief representative of our delegation, after conducting an on-site investigation with the liaison officers of both sides, lodged a serious protest with General Joy, the chief representative of the United Nations forces delegation, demanding severe punishment of the murderers and a complete guarantee that no further incidents violating the Neutral Zone Agreement would occur. However, in his reply to General Nam Il on August 22nd, General Joy deleted the details of the liaison officers' investigation, attempting to shirk the inescapable responsibility of the United Nations forces for this serious incident. On August 27th, the headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers published the detailed report of our liaison officer to Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai, forwarded by General Nam Il, regarding the murder of our military police by armed personnel of the United Nations forces on August 19th. The full text of the report is as follows:

　　(1) Sequence of Events: On the morning of August 19th, nine of our military police, led by platoon leader Yao Qingxiang, who were responsible for guarding the Kaesong Neutral Zone in accordance with the agreement, patrolled eastward along the high ground southwest of Panmunjom's Jeungsan-dong to the north of Songgok-ri. At 5:55 AM, when they reached the high ground between Songgok-ri and Bapsan-ri, they were attacked by more than 30 armed personnel of the United Nations forces, who had illegally entered the Neutral Zone and were lying in ambush approximately 50 meters south, disguised in the bushes. Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang and soldier Wang Renyuan of our military police were shot in the upper part of their left legs and seriously wounded. The armed personnel of the United Nations forces then proceeded to fire two shots into the forehead of the already seriously wounded military police platoon leader Yao Qingxiang, murdering him, and then retreated towards the United Nations forces' front line in Baekdong-eum-ri.

　　(2) From 9:00 AM to 12:50 PM on August 19th, Colonel Zhang Chunshan and Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen, our liaison officers, accompanied by Colonel Murray, liaison officer of the United Nations forces delegation, conducted an on-site investigation report. Our side notified the liaison officer of the United Nations forces delegation of this incident at 8:30 AM on August 19th and requested the other party to send personnel to conduct a joint and immediate investigation. At 9:00 AM sharp, Colonel Murray, the liaison officer of the United Nations forces delegation, arrived near the Panmun Bridge with two translators and met with Colonel Zhang Chunshan and Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen, our liaison officers. In order to intercept the armed personnel of the United Nations forces who were retreating towards the United Nations forces' front line, our side requested to first go to Bapsan-ri and Baekdong-eum-ri for investigation and then return to the scene of the incident for investigation. After the other party agreed, they immediately set off for Bapsan-ri. When they arrived at the eastern entrance of Bapsan-ri, they met two children in the field. Colonel Murray asked the children if they had heard gunshots this morning, and the children replied that they had heard gunshots. When they arrived at the entrance of Baekdong-eum-ri village, they met two more children who were holding rifle and carbine shell casings and bullet clips (all American-made) that they had picked up. We asked them for them, and the liaison officers of both sides examined them and smelled a strong smell of gunpowder on the shell casings. There were still traces of smoke inside the casings, which proved that they had been fired not long ago (the shell casings and bullet clips are all kept by our side). In Baekdong-eum-ri village, Colonel Murray questioned a lame resident (male) and an old man named Kim, both of whom said that they had heard gunshots in the morning, in the cornfield at the western end of Bap Village. Colonel Murray also questioned a young woman, who said that she heard gunshots around the time when she was eating breakfast in broad daylight, and that not long before the liaison officers arrived, she saw about 200 yards away that a Republic of Korea (ROK) army unit passed by, wearing military uniforms and crossing the northern ridge of Baekdong-eum-ri to the east. She also said that ROK army units often came and went here, and sometimes they ate in a small house south of where she was standing. The two sides then agreed to go to Songgok-ri for investigation, first to see the body of Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang, who had died in the morning. There was a bullet hole in the upper part of the left thigh of the body, and two red bullet holes in the center of the forehead, slightly to the right. Later, they went to see the wounded soldier Wang Renyuan, who could not speak due to serious injuries and excessive blood loss, but answered questions with gestures, indicating that the attackers fired many shots. Then, at the suggestion of Colonel Murray, the original patrol team, excluding one dead and one wounded, guided the liaison officers of both sides in their original formation along the original route towards the scene of the incident, describing the situation at that time. According to Deputy Platoon Leader Li Jinglin, when he arrived on the hillside between Songgok-ri and Bapsan-ri at 5:55 AM, he saw enemies in the bushes about 50 meters to his south. He first spotted a person in civilian clothes, wearing a white top and black pants. He then saw five, six, seven, or eight enemies in an instant. He hid behind a haystack and went around. Then he discovered more than ten people lying in ambush in the jungle and immediately firing at him. He did not carry weapons and was the only one in front, so he did not have time to see clearly and rolled and hid in a small pit down the slope. At this time, the enemy fired fiercely and approached him, so he retreated. Soldier Ge Wenju was with Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang. According to him, when the gunshots rang out, Platoon Leader Yao was shot in the leg and could not walk. Ge tried to carry Yao on his back, but could not. Yao ordered Ge to hide quickly because the gunshots were very close, so Ge detoured and hid. Our police personnel returned to the area after the enemy left and found that Platoon Leader Yao had been shot twice in the forehead and died. The wounded soldier Wang Renyuan crawled and hid in the haystack himself and was not discovered, so he was spared. The liaison officers of both sides inspected the two pools of blood at the place where Platoon Leader Yao was killed, and the broken branches of camouflage trees and the shell casings (all made in the United States) left in the bushes where the armed personnel of the United Nations forces were ambushed. At this time, the liaison officer of the other side asked Deputy Platoon Leader Li whether he had clearly seen what unit the attackers were and what clothes they were wearing. Deputy Platoon Leader Li replied that the shooting was very dense at the time, so he could not look up and could not see clearly, but apart from one person in civilian clothes, they were wearing clothes of your color. At this point, the liaison officer of the other side said that he had no other questions to ask. After our police personnel withdrew, our side explained that after this investigation, it was completely clear that the United Nations forces side had violated the Neutral Zone Agreement. Since the Neutral Zone Agreement was reached, incidents of the United Nations forces violating the Neutral Zone Agreement have occurred constantly. On July 16th and August 7th, your side repeatedly fired at the Neutral Zone, and we have protested to your side, but your side has adopted a delaying and irresponsible attitude towards these incidents, resulting in the situation developing so seriously. Today's incident has been investigated in three aspects: first, the investigation and talks with our military police force, and seeing the dead bodies and wounded; second, the on-site investigation at the scene of the incident; third, the residents were questioned in Baekdong-eum-ri, the place where your side invaded the Neutral Zone, especially a woman who said very clearly that she heard gunshots and saw the ROK army retreat, and clearly pointed out that the ROK army often operated in this area, which clearly shows that your side often violates the agreement. Today's incident is a serious incident in which the United Nations forces intentionally violated the agreement and attacked the Neutral Zone. I, on behalf of our chief representative, lodged a serious protest to your side and declared that we reserve the right to demand a solution to this incident. Colonel Murray admitted that the evidence of the incident was indeed clear, that our Neutral Zone patrol team was clearly ambushed. He admitted that there were no shell casings or bullet clips from our side in all the shell casings and bullet clips found, but on the contrary, they were all made in the United States. He also admitted that the woman in Baekdong-eum-ri testified that she saw the retreating attackers were ROK army units. At this point, the two sides decided to return separately and not investigate further. The time was 12:50 PM.

　　In fact, the United Nations forces cavalry division often violates the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement, intruding into the Neutral Zone and operating in the Bapsan-ri and Baekdong-eum-ri areas near Panmunjom, harassing residents. This is something that everyone in the area can prove. Regarding the attack on August 19th, in addition to those who have been questioned during the on-site investigation by the liaison officers of both sides mentioned above, there are still many residents who can provide supporting evidence, which will not be elaborated on here.

　　就美方武装人员杀害我军事警察事件
    我方联络官向金日成彭德怀将军的报告
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】八月十九日清晨联合国军武装人员三十余人，非法潜入开城中立区，并于五时五十五分，在松谷里与钵山里之间岔道附近，伏击我方根据协议在该地巡逻的军事警察，谋害了我方军事警察排长姚庆祥，并重伤战士王仁元。当日我方代表团首席代表南日将军在双方联络官共同进行了实地调查以后，向联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃将军提出严重抗议，要求严惩凶手，并彻底保证不再发生违反中立区协议的任何事件。但乔埃将军在八月二十二日致南日将军的复函中竟删改联络官的调查经过，企图推卸联合国军对于这一严重事件的无可逃避的责任。八月二十七日朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军总部发表了南日将军转呈金日成最高司令官与彭德怀司令员的我方联络官对于八月十九日联合国军武装人员谋害我方军事警察的详细报告。报告全文如下：
    （一）事实经过：八月十九日清晨，根据协议担任开城中立区警卫任务的我方军事警察九人由排长姚庆祥率领，沿板门店西南甑山洞至松谷里以北的高地向东巡逻，于五时五十五分行至松谷里与钵山里之间的高地时，遭到非法侵入中立区而预先埋伏在南方五十公尺左右伪装树丛中的三十余名联合国军的武装人员的袭击。我方军事警察姚庆祥排长、与王仁元战士的左腿上部中弹负重伤。联合国军武装人员更进而向已负重伤的军事警察排长姚庆祥前额上连发两枪，谋杀了姚庆祥，然后向白冬音里联合国军战线方向后撤。
    （二）八月十九日九时至十二时五十分，我方联络官张春山上校与柴成文中校偕同联合国军代表团联络官穆莱上校实地调查报告。我方于八月十九日八时半将此事件通知联合国军代表团联络官，并要求对方派员前来共同立即进行调查。九时正，联合国军代表团联络官穆莱上校携带翻译二人来板门桥附近，与我方联络官张春山上校与柴成文中校相会。我方为追截向联合国军战线方向后撤的联合国军武装人员，要求先赴钵山里与白冬音里调查，然后折回出事地点进行调查。经过对方同意后，遂即向钵山里出发。乃到达钵山里东口时，在田间遇两小孩，穆莱上校问小孩今晨听见枪声没有，小孩答听到枪声。到达白冬音里村口时，又遇两小孩，手中持有拾得的步枪及卡宾枪子弹壳及子弹铗（均美制）。我们向其索来，双方联络官加以检视，嗅得子弹壳火药味甚浓，壳内犹有烟痕，可证明确为射击后未久（弹壳与弹铗均由我方保存）。在白冬音里村内，穆莱上校曾询问一跛足的居民（男性）与金姓老者均谓在早晨听见枪声、在靶村西头包谷地里。穆莱上校又向一年青妇女询问，据称在天大亮吃早饭时分，听到枪声，并在联络官到场以前不久，看到约二百码以外有李承晚国防军部队通过，穿的军衣，向东越过白冬音里北边山脊而去。伊并称这里经常有李承晚国防军部队来往，有时即在她所站处南边的一所小屋里吃饭。双方继同意折赴松谷里调查，首先看早晨牺牲的排长姚庆祥尸身。尸身左大腿有枪眼一处，前额正中偏右红枪眼两处。后又往看受伤的战士王仁元，王因伤重流血过多，不能说话，但用手势答复问题，说明袭击者放枪甚多。然后经穆莱上校提议，由原来之巡逻队除去死伤各一人外，以原队形沿原路线引导双方联络官向出事地点前进，一路叙述当时情况。据副排长李景林述称：他于五时五十五分，刚到松谷里与钵山里间山坡上时，即发现在其南方五十公尺左右树丛里有敌人，首先发现便衣一名，上身衣白，下着黑裤，瞬即发现五、六名至七、八名敌人，他即躲在草堆后绕行而前，旋又发现十余人卧伏丛林中，并立即向他射击。他未带武器，且只一人在前，不暇细看，即滚躲至坡下小坑内。此时敌人射击剧烈，并向其接近，他即后退。战士葛文举系与姚庆祥排长在一起，据称枪声一响时，姚排长腿部即中弹不能行走，葛试背姚却背不动。姚以枪声甚紧，命令葛速去隐蔽，葛遂绕道隐避。我方警察人员于敌走后返回该地，发现姚排长额上被加击两枪死去，受伤战士王仁元则自己爬躲在草堆中，未被发现，得以幸免。双方联络官检视了姚排长牺牲处的两堆血迹，与联合国军武装人员埋伏处树丛中破伪装树枝与所遗弹壳（均系美国制）。是时对方联络官讯问李副排长是否看清袭击者是何部队，穿何服装。李副排长答，当时射击甚密，不能抬头，无法看得清楚，但除便衣一人以外，穿的是你们这种颜色的服装。至此，对方联络官表示已没有其他问题要问。我方警察人员退开后，我方说明经过此次调查，事情完全清楚是联合国军方面破坏中立区的协议。自中立区协议达成后，不断发生联合国军违反中立区协议事件，七月十六日与八月七日，你方曾一再向中立区射击，我们曾向你方提出抗议，但你方对这种事件采取了拖延敷衍和不负责的态度，以致事态发展得这样严重。今天的事件已经过三个方面的调查：一是对我方军事警察部队的调查和谈话，及看了死尸和伤员。二是在事件发生地点进行了实地调查。三是在你方侵入中立区地点白冬音里询问了居民，特别是有位妇女说得很清楚，她听见了枪声，看见李承晚国防军撤退，并且明确指出李承晚国防军经常在该地区活动，这明显地说明了你方经常违反协议。今天的事件是联合国军方面有意违反协议向中立区进攻的严重事件，我代表我方首席代表对此向你方提出严重抗议，并声明保留对此事件提出解决要求的权利。穆莱上校承认发生的事件证据确实，显然是我方中立区巡逻队中了伏击，他承认在所有发现的弹壳、弹铗中没有任何我方的弹壳、弹铗，而相反都是美国制的。他也承认白冬音里的那位妇女作证说，她亲眼看见撤退的袭击者是李承晚国防军的部队。至此，双方决定分头返回不再调查，是时为十二时五十分。
    事实上联合国军骑兵师经常破坏开城中立区协议，侵入中立区板门店附近钵山里与白冬音里一带活动，骚扰居民，这是该地区居民人人可以证明的。关于八月十九日袭击事件，除上述双方联络官实地调查时已询问者外，亦尚有很多居民可以提出证明材料，现不赘述。
