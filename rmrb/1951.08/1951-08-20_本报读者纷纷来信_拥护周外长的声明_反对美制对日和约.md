　　Our Readers Write in Succession
　　Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou’s Statement; Opposing the U.S.-Made Peace Treaty with Japan
　　Editor's Note: On August 16th, this newspaper published Foreign Minister Zhou’s statement regarding the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference. On the 17th, we received twelve letters from readers Yang Hegao, Yu Zuomin, the first-year reading group of the History Department of the Normal University, Zhu Lei, Zhang Ping, Wang Xianwen, Li Jingtiao, Ding Shanfu, Ye Fimu, Lian Xiang, Yi Shui, Xu Guoping, and employees of the Beijing Telegraph Bureau, unanimously supporting Foreign Minister Zhou’s statement and opposing the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan. We are now publishing five of them below:
　　　　　　(I) To the Editor:
　　Having read the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan, I am extremely indignant. The Chinese people waged a long and arduous struggle in resisting and defeating Japanese imperialism, suffering incalculable losses in life and property. Yet, this so-called "draft peace treaty" excludes the People’s Republic of China from the Allied nations that fought against Japan. The U.S. imperialism's unconscionable and absurd act is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.
　　Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are Chinese territory, and no one can deny this. However, the "draft peace treaty" only stipulates that "Japan renounces all rights, titles and claims to Taiwan and the Penghu Islands." It makes no mention of the issue of the sovereignty of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. The U.S. imperialism's attempt to occupy Taiwan for a long time is well known, and this conspiracy is fully exposed in the "draft peace treaty." Let me tell the U.S. imperialist elements that the Chinese people, who have stood up, have enough strength to liberate Taiwan and defend all the territory of the motherland! China's territory belongs to the Chinese people; you shouldn't even dream of getting a single advantage!
　　The "draft peace treaty" thoroughly exposes the U.S.'s intention to openly and "legally" occupy Japan and accelerate the rearmament of Japan as a tool for invading Asia and launching new wars. People all over the world must oppose this "draft peace treaty" that prepares for new wars!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yang Hegao, Student of the Department of Political Science, Peking University
　　　　　　(II) To the Editor:
　　The U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan, simultaneously announced in Washington and London on July 12th, once again blatantly demonstrates that U.S. and British imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is determined to be the enemy of the Chinese people. First of all, the preparation and drafting of this so-called "draft peace treaty with Japan" is entirely dominated by the U.S. government, excluding and depriving the People's Republic of China of its legitimate status in the preparation, drafting, and signing of the peace treaty with Japan, which is intolerable to the Chinese people. Secondly, in the territorial clauses, U.S. imperialism, in addition to its usual ambiguous wording on the sovereignty of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, also basely and shamelessly raised the issue of the sovereignty of the Xisha Islands and Nansha Islands, attempting to steal these islands of our country in an unclear manner. Most intolerable is that U.S. imperialism attempts to obliterate the great contribution of the great Chinese people in the War of Resistance Against Japan, arrogantly intending to delete the historical facts of the Chinese people's independent and arduous struggle from September 18, 1931, to December 7, 1941, especially from July 7, 1937, to December 7, 1941, from the entire history of the war against Japan. This is simply resorting to any means, reaching the point of absurdity. This U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan, which is hostile to the Chinese people and betrays the interests of the people of Asian countries and the Japanese people, is absolutely unacceptable to us. The Chinese people firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou’s solemn statement issued on August 15th, expressing the firm will and just stand of the 475 million Chinese people. In the eyes of our Chinese people, this U.S.-made peace treaty is like a piece of waste paper and is completely invalid.

　　　　　　(III) To the Editor:
　　On August 15th, our Foreign Minister Zhou issued a statement on the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference, pointing out that "the draft peace treaty with Japan proposed by the U.S. and British governments is a draft that undermines international agreements and is fundamentally unacceptable," and that "the San Francisco Conference is also a conference that betrays international obligations and is fundamentally unrecognisable." This solemn statement fully meets the demands of the 475 million people of the People's Republic of China and also meets the demands of peace-loving people all over the world.
　　The U.S.-British peace treaty with Japan fully exposes its consistent conspiracy to arm Japan and its hostile attitude towards the peace camp, especially towards China and the Soviet Union. We unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou’s solemn and just statement and are determined to fight U.S. imperialism to the end with practical actions.

　　　　　　(IV) To the Editor:
　　U.S. and British imperialists attempt to deceive the whole world. In their separate “draft peace treaty with Japan,” they openly exclude the People’s Republic of China from the Allied nations that fought against Japan, tamper with the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and use ambiguous wording regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, the Xisha Islands, and the Nansha Islands. Their "draft peace treaty with Japan" accurately portrays the hideous and shameless faces of the imperialists. Everyone knows that the War of Resistance Against Japan began in China. Shenyang and Lugouqiao are Chinese territories, where Japan launched its wars of aggression in 1931 and 1937. The Chinese people cannot forget our enormous sacrifices in the War of Resistance Against Japan. According to the available data, in Jiangxi Province alone, the population casualty count was 504,450 during the eight years of the war. In Nanchang City alone, the property loss was 391,874 buildings, accounting for 77.9% of the original houses before the war. The Chinese people fought the Japanese imperialists for the longest time and made the greatest contribution to defeating Japanese imperialism. Therefore, we have the most legitimate right to speak and participate in the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. The Chinese people cannot tolerate the U.S. and British imperialists' attempt to sign a separate "peace treaty with Japan" that excludes the People's Republic of China and prepares to launch a new war. We must use practical actions to express our angry protest. We must strengthen the work of donating airplanes and cannons, promoting patriotic pledges, and giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. We must increase production and consolidate national defense to respond to the shameless separate "peace treaty" with Japan by U.S. and British imperialism. We support Foreign Minister Zhou’s statement: "The draft peace treaty with Japan proposed by the U.S. and British governments is a draft that undermines international agreements and is fundamentally unacceptable," and "the San Francisco Conference is also a conference that betrays international obligations and is fundamentally unrecognisable."

　　　　　　(V) To the Editor:
　　Foreign Minister Zhou’s statement on August 15th, "Regarding the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference," pointed out: "The draft peace treaty with Japan proposed by the U.S. and British governments is a draft that undermines international agreements and is fundamentally unacceptable," and "the San Francisco Conference is also a conference that betrays international obligations and is fundamentally unrecognisable." This represents the will and demands of the 475 million people of China. We fully support it.
　　Our Chinese people have undergone the longest and most arduous struggle in resisting and defeating Japanese imperialism, sacrificing the most and contributing the most. Therefore, we have the most legitimate right to speak and participate in the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. However, the U.S. and British governments have arbitrarily tampered with the history of the War of Resistance Against Japan and openly excluded the People’s Republic of China from the preparation for the peace treaty with Japan and from the Allied nations that fought against Japan. This hostile and illegal barbaric act against the Chinese people is absolutely intolerable to us and will be resolutely opposed to the end.
　　In the content of the U.S.-British "draft peace treaty with Japan" and the actions of the so-called "San Francisco Conference" to be held, in addition to the naked exposure of the U.S. imperialism’s firm attitude of being the enemy of the Chinese people, we can clearly see that "the U.S. government and its vassals are blatantly pursuing a central goal: rearming Japan, organizing a new Pacific aggressive group, expanding the war of aggression in Asia, and actively preparing for a new world war." Therefore, they completely disregard the proposals of China, the Soviet Union, and other countries that advocate a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and resolutely implement their war policy. This is not only hostile to China and the Soviet Union, endangering the security of Asian and Australian countries, but also a great disaster for the Japanese nation and the Japanese people!
　　The entire Chinese people must support Foreign Minister Zhou’s solemn statement with practical actions and firmly advocate convening a comprehensive peace conference participated by all Allied nations that fought against Japan. We resolutely oppose the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan and resolutely oppose rearming Japan! We must resolutely fight to the end for the conclusion of a truly peaceful and comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

专栏：读者来信

　　本报读者纷纷来信
    拥护周外长的声明  反对美制对日和约
    编者按：八月十六日，本报发表了周外长关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的声明。十七日，我们就收到杨鹤皋、余作民、师范大学历史系一年级读报组、朱磊、张苹、王宪文、李经桃、丁善甫、叶菲木、连祥、易水、许国萍、北京电信局电报处职工读者来信十二封，一致拥护周外长的声明，反对美英对日和约草案。现将其中五封刊登于后：
            （一）编辑同志：
    看到了美英对日的和约草案，我气愤极了。中国人民在抵抗和击败日本帝国主义的战争中，作了长期艰苦的斗争，生命财产的损失不可数计。而这个所谓“和约草案”却把中华人民共和国排除于对日作战盟国之外。美帝国主义这种昧尽天良、荒谬绝伦的勾当是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    台湾和澎湖列岛是中国的领土，谁也不能否认，“和约草案”中却只规定“日本放弃对台湾及澎湖列岛的一切权利、权利根据与要求”。而关于台湾和澎湖列岛的归属问题却只字不提。美帝国主义企图长期侵占台湾的诡计是人所共知的，而在“和约草案”中又把这个阴谋暴露无遗。告诉美帝国主义分子们，站起来了的中国人民有足够力量解放台湾，保卫祖国的一切领土！中国的领土是中国人民的，你们休想讨得半点便宜！
    “和约草案”彻头彻尾地暴露了美国只想把占领日本公开“合法”化、加速重新武装日本，作为侵略亚洲、发动新战争的工具。这种准备新战争的“和约草案”，全世界人民都要反对它！
                              北京大学政治系学生  杨鹤皋
            （二）编辑同志：
    七月十二日在华盛顿和伦敦同时公布的美英对日和约草案，再一次露骨地说明美英帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，是死心塌地地与中国人民为敌的。首先，这个所谓“对日和约草案”的准备、拟制，完全是美国政府一手独揽，排斥并剥夺了我中华人民共和国在对日和约的准备、拟制以及签订过程中的合法地位，这是中国人民不能容忍的。其次，在领土条款内，美帝国主义除了照例地对台湾和澎湖列岛的归属问题含混其词以外，还卑鄙无赖地提出了西沙群岛和南威岛的归属问题，企图把我国的这些岛屿不明不白地劫为己有。令人最不能容忍的是，美帝国主义企图抹煞伟大的中国人民在抗日战争中的伟大贡献，狂妄地打算把一九三一年九月十八日至一九四一年十二月七日，特别是一九三七年七月七日至一九四一年十二月七日，这一段中国人民独力艰苦奋斗的史实从整个的对日战争的历史中删去。这简直是不择手段到了荒谬绝顶的地步。这一敌视中国人民、出卖亚洲各国人民以及日本人民的利益的美制对日和约，我们是绝对不能接受的。中国人民坚决拥护周外长在八月十五日发表的，表达了四亿七千五百万中国人民的坚强意志与正义立场的庄严声明。在我们中国人民看来，这一美制对日和约如同一张废纸一样，是完全无效的。

            （三）编辑同志：
    八月十五日我周外长发表关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的声明，指出“美英两国政府所提出的对日和约草案是一件破坏国际协定基本上不能被接受的草案”，“旧金山会议也是一个背弃国际义务基本上不能被承认的会议”。这一庄严的声明完全符合中华人民共和国四亿七千五百万人民的要求，也符合全世界爱好和平人民的要求。
    美英对日和约完全暴露他一贯武装日本的阴谋和对和平阵营，尤其是对中国和苏联的敌视态度。我们一致拥护周外长这一庄严正义的声明，并坚决以实际行动与美帝国主义斗争到底。

            （四）编辑同志：
    美英帝国主义者企图一手掩尽天下人耳目，在其单独“对日和约草案”中，竟公然把中华人民共和国排除于对日作战盟国之外，篡改了抗日战争的时期，并对台湾、澎湖列岛以及西沙群岛、南威岛的归属问题含混其词。他们的这个“对日和约草案”确切地绘出了帝国主义者狰狞无耻的嘴脸。人人都知道，抗日战争是从中国开始的。沈阳、芦沟桥是中国的土地，是日本在一九三一年，一九三七年发动侵略战争的地点。中国人民不能忘记我们在抗日战争中的巨大牺牲。就手边的资料来看，仅江西一省在抗战八年中人口伤亡数就是五十万四千四百五十人；南昌一市抗战中房产损失三十九万一千八百七十四栋，占战前原有房屋百分之七十七点九。而中国人民和日本帝国主义作战的时间也最久，对击败日本帝国主义的贡献也最大。因此，在对日和约问题上，我们是最有合法权利的发言者和参加者。美英帝国主义企图签订排斥中华人民共和国、准备发动新战争的单独“对日和约”，中国人民是不能容忍的。我们要以实际行动来表示我们愤怒的抗议。我们要加强捐献飞机大炮、推行爱国公约和优待烈军属等抗美援朝工作，增加生产，巩固国防，来回答美英帝国主义无耻的单独对日“和约”。我们拥护周外长的声明：“美英两国政府所提出的对日和约草案是一件破坏国际协定基本上不能被接受的草案”，“旧金山会议也是一个背弃国际义务基本上不能被承认的会议”。

            （五）编辑同志：
    周外长在八月十五日发表的“关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的声明”指出：“美英两国政府所提出的对日和约草案是一件破坏国际协定基本上不能被接受的草案”，“旧金山会议也是一个背弃国际义务基本上不能被承认的会议”。这代表了全中国四亿七千五百万人民的意志和要求。我们完全拥护。
    我们中国人民在抵抗和击败日本帝国主义的战争中，经过了最长期的艰苦斗争，牺牲最大，贡献最多。因此，我们在对日和约问题上是最有合法权利的发言者和参加者。而美英政府竟擅自篡改抗日战争历史，公然排除我中华人民共和国于对日和约的准备工作之外和我们参加对日作战的盟国之外。这种敌视中国人民的非法蛮横行为，是我们绝对不能容忍并将坚决反对到底的。
    在美英“对日和约草案”的内容上和将要召开的所谓“旧金山会议”的行动中，除了赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义坚决与中国人民为敌的态度以外，我们更可以清楚地看到“美国政府及其附庸露骨地追求一个中心目标：重新武装日本，组织新的太平洋侵略集团，扩大在亚洲的侵略战争，并积极准备新的世界战争”。因此，它们完全不顾中苏两国及其他赞成对日全面和约的主张，坚决执行其战争政策。这不仅是敌视中、苏两国，危害亚洲澳洲各国的安全，而且也将是日本国家民族和日本人民的大灾难！
    全中国人民要以实际行动拥护周外长的庄严声明，坚决主张召开所有对日战争盟国参加制订的全面和会。我们坚决反对美英对日和约草案，坚决反对重新武装日本！我们要坚决为缔结真正和平的全面的对日和约而斗争到底。
