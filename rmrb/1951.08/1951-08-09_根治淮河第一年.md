The First Year of Radically Controlling the Huai River

The completion of the first year of the Huai River radical control project is a miracle in the history of Chinese water conservancy construction.

From the winter of 1950 to around July 1951, approximately eight months, the project completed the Runheji Flood Diversion Sluice Gate, capable of controlling more than 7.2 billion cubic meters of floodwater from the Huai River's main stream. It also completed the Shimantan Valley Reservoir, capable of irrigating 90,000 mu of farmland, and earthwork projects such as dike restoration, dredging, and ditching, totaling 195 million cubic meters. If this earth were used to build a wall one meter high and one meter wide, its length would reach 200,000 kilometers, enough to encircle the Earth's equator five times.

How was this miracle created? Upon the successful completion of the project, the people of the Huai River basin concluded: "Without the Communist Party, the Huai River could not be tamed!"

Yes, without the leadership of the Communist Party, it would be unimaginable to complete such a challenging Huai River control project. Regarding the Huai River control policy, the State Council of the Central People's Government clearly put forward the principle of "combining storage and discharge" last October. The main focus of the People's Government in water management is on how to utilize water. It aims not only to eradicate water disasters but also to develop water conservancy, laying the foundation for large-scale economic construction in the future. The Kuomintang reactionary rulers chanted "Guiding the Huai" for twenty years, but never thought of building "flood storage projects" to develop the Huai River's water resources. In the past, under the rule of feudal forces, irreconcilable conflicts of interest existed among the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River basin, making it impossible to propose a Huai River control policy that took into account all three regions. Today, under the unified leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the upper, middle, and lower reaches are closely cooperating, and historical contradictions that were impossible to resolve are easily solved. In terms of project funding, the Kuomintang only spent more than 700 million jin of grain in nearly twenty years of chanting about Huai River control, and most of it was embezzled by the reactionary rulers. Today, the funds used by the People's Government for the first year of Huai River control far exceed this amount. In terms of mobilizing manpower, the three provinces of Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu along the Huai River mobilized a total of three million laborers last winter and this spring, and more than 16,000 water conservancy experts, engineers, and various technical personnel from all over the country went to participate in the Huai River control. This is also unprecedented in Chinese history. To ensure the timely supply of equipment and materials needed for the project, the Huai River Control Committee sent thousands of working cadres to organize a huge transportation network along the land and water transportation lines, and set up hundreds of transshipment stations. Local railway bureaus also guaranteed priority transportation of Huai River control equipment, and almost all ships on the Huai River were organized to serve the Huai River control. In northern Anhui alone, more than 8,000 large and small ships and more than 7,400 vehicles were mobilized to transport Huai River control equipment, with 60,000 boatmen and more than 900,000 land transport laborers participating. This huge transportation network transported 2 billion jin of Huai River control materials from Northeast China outside the customs, the southern coast, the Shandong Peninsula, and the central plains to the Huai River control construction site.

From beginning to end, the Huai River control project received active support from the people all over the country. Whatever was needed, was provided. For example, the thousands of technical workers who built the Shimantan Reservoir and the Runheji Diversion Sluice Gate came from large and small cities such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, Zhengzhou, and Kaifeng. The Runheji Diversion Sluice Gate construction site was short of stonemasons. The Huai River Control Committee asked the Shandong Provincial People's Government for assistance. In less than ten days, 1,600 stonemasons gathered and rushed to Runheji. The diversion sluice gate project required 20,000 cubic meters of yellow sand. The Jiashan County People's Government in northern Anhui immediately organized a large number of laborers, led by responsible cadres of the county People's Government, and delivered 20,000 cubic meters of yellow sand to the construction site on schedule within thirty-five days. The Huai River control laborers needed a large number of doctors to help with epidemic prevention and treatment. The Central People's Government and East China and Central South China immediately sent seven medical teams, together with the existing local doctors, to form a team of white-clad warriors of more than 3,000 people.

During the project, countless difficulties were overcome by adopting the advanced experience and methods of the Soviet Union. If the old technical viewpoints and working methods had been followed, the first phase of the Huai River control project would not only have been impossible to complete in a short period of time, but it would have been impossible to complete at all. The Runheji Diversion Sluice Gate is the most obvious example.

It was very difficult to build a huge sluice gate 1,300 meters wide and 200 meters long, and it had to be completed in just three months. According to the old method, such a large sluice gate would require at least 12,000 foundation piles and 10,000 square meters of sheet piles, and piling alone would take half a year. Moreover, the sheet piles had to be American pitch pine, and the gates had to be produced in London, England. However, we solved this problem by adopting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Soviet experts introduced a new design method, and the entire project did not require a single foundation pile; at the same time, no sheet piles were driven. We used the clay from the opposite bank of the Huai River to lay an impermeable clay layer, replacing the American pitch pine; the huge gates were also manufactured in the factories of the Shanghai people themselves. Various difficulties in specific construction, such as quicksand and springs found under the fixed riverbed, were also resolved under the specific guidance of Soviet experts. These were unimaginable in the past reactionary ruling era. In the past, during the Kuomintang rule, the Yangzhuang movable dam in northern Jiangsu took twenty-two months to complete; the Shaobo ship lock, which was several times smaller than the Runheji Diversion Sluice Gate, took eighteen months to complete. The gate of the above project was much smaller and simpler than the current gate of the Runheji Diversion Sluice Gate (only 10 meters wide and non-powered opening and closing), but in the past it was manufactured by British manufacturers.

During the construction of the first year of the Huai River control project, thanks to the correct leadership of the People's Government and the encouragement of the national enthusiasm for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, millions of workers, laborers, and project personnel gave full play to their high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in their work, ensuring the completion of the project as scheduled. The workers and laborers who built the Runheji Diversion Sluice Gate worked day and night under the slogan of "racing against the flood." The hardware workers from Shanghai who installed the gates persisted in working all day long in the scorching heat of more than 100 degrees and in the continuous rain. The crane workers, in cooperation with the technicians, installed the oil pressure cylinders on the gates, initially installing one in three hours, and later increasing to three in one hour. The riveters initially needed twelve hours to rivet about 10,000 rivets on a gate, but later only needed five hours. In the arduous Suihe River dredging project, 300,000 laborers carried out an unyielding struggle against the sand and gravel soil and groundwater. The sand and gravel soil was as small as an egg and as large as a boulder, as hard as iron, and many laborers still persisted in working even though their hands were worn with hard and thick calluses and their feet were scratched and bleeding. In order to drain the groundwater, they used more than 400 waterwheels and more than 4,000 bamboo buckets day and night to drain water on the 60-li plain river section. ...

There is no need to list more examples. The above facts have shown that the miracle of the first year of the Huai River control was created by three million workers, laborers, technicians, and cadres under the determination of Chairman Mao to "build the Huai River well," under the unified leadership of the Communist Party and the people's governments at all levels, with the help of advanced Soviet experience, and with the support of the people of the whole country, with unparalleled labor enthusiasm and wisdom.

From the Huai River control project, people can specifically see the infinitely beautiful prospects of the new China.

　　根治淮河第一年
    根治淮河第一年工程的完成，在中国水利建设史上是一个奇迹。
    在一九五○年冬至一九五一年七月前后约八个月中，共计完成了可控制淮河干流七十二亿多立方公尺洪水的润河集蓄洪分水闸，完成了可灌溉九万亩耕地的石漫滩山谷水库，完成了复堤、疏浚、沟洫等土方工程一亿九千五百万公方。如果把这些土筑成高、宽各一公尺的土墙，其长度达二十万公里，可环绕地球赤道五周。
    这个奇迹是怎样创造出来的呢？在工程胜利完成时，淮河流域的人民作了这样的结论：“没有共产党，淮河治不好！”
    是的，如果没有共产党的领导，要完成如此艰巨的治淮工程是不可想像的。在治淮方针上，去年十月中央人民政府政务院明确提出了“蓄泄兼筹”的方针。人民政府领导治水的主要着眼点是如何利用水。不仅要根除水患，而且要发展水利，为将来大规模的经济建设奠定基础。而国民党反动统治者高唱“导淮”二十年，却根本没有想到过建造“蓄洪工程”，以发展淮河水利。从前在封建势力统治下，淮河流域上、中、下游地区向来存在着难以调解的利害矛盾，根本不可能提出一个上、中、下游互相兼顾的治淮方针。今天在毛主席和中央人民政府的统一领导下，上、中、下游地区密切合作，历史上无法解决的矛盾问题，都迎刃而解。在工程经费上，国民党高唱治淮近二十年中仅用去七亿多斤粮食，而其中绝大部分又均为反动统治者所贪污中饱。今天，人民政府用于治淮第一年的经费即远超过此数。在人力的动员上，河南、皖北、苏北三个沿淮河省区去冬今春动员的民工即共达三百万人，全国各地前往参加治淮的水利专家、工程师以及各种技术人员共一万六千多人，这也是中国史无前例的。为了保证工程所需器材物资的及时供应，治淮委员会派出数千名工作干部在水陆交通线上组织了庞大的运输网，设立了数百个转运站；各地铁路局也保证要优先运输治淮器材，淮河的船只几乎全部组织起来为治淮服务。仅皖北一区动员来运输治淮器材的大小船只就有八千多只，大小车辆七千四百多辆，参加的船工有六万人，陆运民工有九十多万人。这一庞大运输网使二十亿斤的治淮物资，从关外的东北和南方的海边，以及山东半岛和中原腹地源源运到治淮工地上。
    从开始到结束，治淮工程都得到全国各地人民的积极支援。要什么，有什么。如建造石漫滩水库和润河集分水闸的成千上万的技术工人，就是来自上海、杭州、南京、无锡、郑州、开封等大小城市的。润河集分水闸工地上缺少石工，治淮委员会请山东省人民政府帮助解决，不到十天，一千六百名石工即集中赶到了润河集。分水闸工程需用二万公方黄沙，皖北嘉山县人民政府立即组织了大批民工，由县人民政府的负责干部亲自领导，在三十五天内就将二万公方黄沙按期送到了工地。治淮民工需要大批医生帮助防疫治病，中央人民政府和华东、中南等地立即派来了七个医疗大队，配合当地原有的医生，组成了一个三千多人的白衣战士队伍。
    在工程中由于接受了苏联的先进的经验和方法，无数的困难都被战胜了。如果按照旧的技术观点和工作方法来作，治淮第一期的工程不仅不可能在短期内完成，而且根本不可能完成。润河集分水闸就是一个最明显的例子。
    要建造一座一千三百公尺宽，二百公尺长的巨大水闸，而且一定要在短短的三个月内完成，这是非常困难的。按照老的作法，像这样大的水闸，至少要打一万二千根基桩和一万平方公尺的板桩，仅仅打桩就得打半年。而且板桩还必须是美国的洋松，闸门必须是英国伦敦的出品。但是，我们接受苏联的先进经验解决了这个问题。苏联专家介绍了一种新的设计方法，整个工程一根基桩都不用；同时不打板桩。我们用淮河对岸的粘土铺设成不透水的粘土层，代替了美国洋松；巨大的闸门，也在上海人民自己的工厂里制造了出来。具体施工中的各种困难，如固定河槽下面发现流沙、泉眼，也在苏联专家的具体指导下，得到解决。这些都是在过去反动统治时代不可想像的事情。过去在国民党统治时代，苏北的杨庄活动坝，做了二十二个月才完成；小于润河集分水闸数倍的邵伯船闸，做了十八个月才完成。上项工程的闸门，比现在润河集分水闸的闸门小得多，简单得多（仅宽十公尺，且非动力启闭），但过去却是依靠英国厂商制造的。
    治淮第一年工程施工过程中，由于人民政府的正确领导和全国抗美援朝热情的鼓舞，数百万工人、民工和工程人员们在工作中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，保证了工程的如期完成。修建润河集分水闸的工人和民工在“与洪水赛跑”的口号下日夜突击工作。来自上海的装闸门的五金工人，在一百多度的酷暑下和连绵的阴雨里，整日坚持工作。起重工人在技工配合下，装置闸门上的油压筒，起初三小时装一个，后来提高到一小时装三个。铆钉工人开始要以十二小时才能钉好一扇闸门上一万左右的铆钉，以后只需要五个钟头。艰巨的濉河疏浚工程，三十万民工和砂礓土、地下水进行了不屈的斗争。砂礓土小如鸡蛋，大如巨石，坚硬得像铁块一样，许多民工虽然手上被磨出又硬又厚的茧皮，脚被擦破流血，仍然坚持工作。为了排除地下水，他们在六十里平地开河的工段上，用四百多辆水车，四千多个笆斗日夜不停地排水。……
    用不着列举更多的例子了。上述事实已说明了治淮第一年的奇迹，是三百万工人、民工、技术工人和干部们在毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的决心下，在共产党和各级人民政府的统一领导下，在苏联先进经验的帮助下，在全国人民的支援下，用无比的劳动热情与智慧创造出来的。
    从治淮工程中，人们可以具体地看到新中国的无限美好的远景。
