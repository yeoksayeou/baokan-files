Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th—Overseas Chinese in Pyongyang enthusiastically responded to the call of the China Resist-America Aid-Korea General Association, actively donating money to purchase planes and cannons to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. As of the end of July, the Overseas Chinese in Pyongyang had donated 7,838,900 North Korean won. The 115 Overseas Chinese farming households in Linwon District, West Pyongyang, donated 2,324,000 North Korean won. The Overseas Chinese farmers of Daetoling, South Pyongyang, donated 1,657,900 North Korean won. Yu Fangde, an Overseas Chinese farmer from Ganhung-ri, West Pyongyang, said during the donation: "The American devils frantically bomb us during the ceasefire negotiations. Take our Ganhung-ri, for example. In July, more than 200 people were killed or injured by the American robbers. It is very doubtful whether the Americans have any sincerity for peace. We must intensify our production and support the front line; we cannot relax in the slightest."

    【新华社平壤四日电】平壤市华侨热烈响应祖国抗美援朝总会的号召，踊跃捐款，购买飞机大炮，支援中国人民志愿军。截至七月底，平壤市华侨已捐献了朝币七百八十三万八千九百元。西平壤林原区的华侨农民一百一十五户，捐献了朝币二百三十二万四千元。南平壤大驼岭的华侨农民捐献了朝币一百六十五万七千九百元。西平壤坎兴里的华侨农民于芳德在捐款时说：美国鬼子在停战谈判期中疯狂地轰炸我们，拿我们坎兴里来说，在七月中，就被美国强盗炸死、炸伤二百多人。美国人有没有和平诚意，很成疑问。咱们加紧生产、支援前线的工作，丝毫也不能放松。
