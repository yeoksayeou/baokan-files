　　To the Editor:

    The Tanggu Private Yongli Chemical Industry Company's factories, due to crude safety and sanitary equipment, have seriously affected the workers' safety and health. In terms of safety equipment, some workshops (buildings) in the factory have long exceeded their insurance period. The building beams, floors, and other ancillary equipment are all rotten or dilapidated. Platforms on the seventh and eighth floors have no railings, and workers perform their work on them. Some boilers have also exceeded their service life and have the potential for explosion at any time. The ventilation equipment in the workshops is also very poor, and the odors of dust, ammonia, and magnesium carbonate are difficult to remove, causing many workers to suffer from lung diseases and bronchitis. The indoor temperature is extremely high, generally above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, and workers often faint during summer work. Many pieces of equipment that are easy to provide are not provided by the capitalists. For example, the drying room has 120 workers, who should all wear masks to work, but the capitalists only issue 40 masks per month. Most workers have to breathe the foul-smelling air with their mouths open. The alkali powder in the drying room irritates the eyes, but the capitalists do not issue glasses, so many workers get eye diseases. When repairing machines, there is also a lack of necessary equipment. For example, in the power room, when repairing hot machines, the capitalists do not issue aprons and gloves to protect the body, so workers have to wrap their hands with their own things before working. The workers who repair the carbonic acid wells do not have gas masks, so they have to hold their breath to work in the wells, but they have to come up to breathe air again after a while, otherwise they will be poisoned.

    Due to the above circumstances, the Yongli factory had two major accidents from November of last year to March of this year. One was when worker Gao Yushan had a leg mangled by a machine; the other was when technician Wei Yunchang had an arm mangled. Statistics for March, April, and May of this year show that the factory averaged about 100 people suffering from bronchitis, and more than 110 people suffering from conjunctivitis, and between 300 and 400 people with skin injuries each month.

    Regarding the above situation, the factory union formally proposed suggestions for improving safety and sanitary equipment to the capitalists at labor-management consultation meetings, but most of them were rejected by the factory director or delayed. Once, the workers in the power room asked the factory director to issue gloves, but were unreasonably refused. He said, "We haven't issued them for decades, and we don't need them now." We believe that this situation of neglecting workers' safety and health urgently needs to be corrected.

    安全卫生设备简陋  严重影响工人健康
    编辑同志：
    塘沽私营永利化学工业公司所属工厂，由于安全卫生设备的简陋，已严重影响了工人的生命安全和健康。在安全设备方面，该厂某些车间（楼房）早已超过保险期，楼梁、地板及其他的附属设备，都已腐朽或是破烂不堪；七、八层楼上的平台，没有栏杆，工人就在上面进行工作；有的锅炉也已经超过了使用期限，随时都有爆炸的可能性。车间通气设备也很差，灰尘、阿母尼亚、炭酸镁的气味难于排出，使不少工人患有肺病和支气管炎，室内温度奇高，夏季一般在华氏一百度以上，工人在夏天工作时常常昏倒。有许多设备是很容易做到的，资方也不备置。如干燥室有一百二十名工人，按理都应戴上口罩才能工作，但资方每月只发给四十个口罩，大部分工人只好张口呼吸恶臭空气，干燥室的碱粉刺激眼睛，资方也不发给眼镜，许多工人因此得了眼病。在修理机器时，也没有必要的一些设备。像动力室，在修理滚烫的机器时，资方并不发给防护身体的围裙和手套，工人只好用自己的东西把手包起来再去工作。修理炭酸井的工人，没有防毒面具，他们只好别住气下井工作，但不一会儿就要重新上来呼吸空气，否则就会中毒。
    由于上述的一些情况，永利工厂自去年十一月至今年三月曾发生两次重大事故，一次是工人高玉善被机器绞去了一只腿；一次是技术员魏云昌被绞去了一条手臂。今年三、四、五三个月统计，全厂平均每月有一百人左右患支气管炎，一百数十人患结膜病，皮肤外伤则在三、四百人之间。
    上述情况，该厂工会曾在劳资协商会议上，向资方正式提出改进安全和卫生设备的建议，但大都被该厂厂长拒绝，或者是拖延不办。动力室工人有一次要求厂长发给手套，却被无理拒绝。并说：“过去几十年都没有发过，现在也不需要。”我们认为这种忽视工人生命安全和健康的情况，亟待纠正。
