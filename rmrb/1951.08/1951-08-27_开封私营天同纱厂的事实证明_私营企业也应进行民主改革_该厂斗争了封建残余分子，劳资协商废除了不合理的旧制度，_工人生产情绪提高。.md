The facts of the private Tian Tong Yarn Factory in Kaifeng prove that
	Private enterprises should also undergo democratic reform
	The factory fought against feudal remnants, labor-management consultation abolished unreasonable old systems, and workers' production enthusiasm increased.
	In the democratic reform movement, the private Tian Tong Yarn Factory in Kaifeng fully mobilized the worker masses, carried out grievance airing, raised the workers' awareness, fought against feudal reactionary elements, and after joint consultations between labor and management, abolished unreasonable old systems, paving a new path for future production.
	Before the democratic reform, various tasks in the factory could not be carried out, labor-management disputes frequently occurred, and workers were not united. Although cadres from the higher-level trade union or other relevant units often came to the factory to assist in the work, they could not solve any specific problems. Some cadres believed: "The workers of Tian Tong are backward and disunited, only making trouble." Some believed that "The trade union of Tian Tong Factory is not effective, cannot represent the interests of all workers, and cannot educate and improve workers." In short, everyone felt that "the problem is complex and the work is difficult." During the Resist America and Aid Korea movement, the Kaifeng Municipal Trade Union work team came to the factory to work and heard the workers say: "The superiors only come to understand the situation but do not solve the problem." The worker Li Heting said to the work team cadres: "Comrades, don't leave, solve the unreasonable things in our factory properly!" The work team cadre asked him: "What are the unreasonable things?" He coughed and said: "Good people dare not speak!" Based on this situation, the work team believed that the main reason was that there were still feudal remnants in the factory directly oppressing the workers and dividing the workers' unity. Therefore, it was necessary to fully mobilize the workers and thoroughly carry out democratic reform. The work team, through the factory trade union, mobilized the workers to study Resist America and Aid Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and carried out political education targeting the suffering the workers had experienced in the past, asking everyone: "What suffering have we endured?", "Who gave us the suffering?", "Are we willing to continue to suffer?"... and other questions, and asked the workers to discuss them. In addition, the work team comrades criticized the working style of simply blaming the masses for being backward and not going deep into the masses. After enlightenment and education, the workers broke their concerns and began to air their grievances.
	In the accusations, those feudal remnants who were still oppressing the workers in the factory were exposed. For example, the female worker Qian Rendi was initially unwilling to air her grievances, fearing that it would be useless, but after the trade union cadres talked to her, she broke her concerns and aired the oppression she had suffered in the factory, and boldly revealed how the female foreman Jiang Wenqin deducted their wages, abused and insulted the female workers.
	Then many workers stood up to air their grievances, and those who aired their grievances automatically mobilized others to do so. The male worker Xu Yaoliang said: "Let's speak out! This time we must thoroughly turn ourselves over!" The mood was very high. Seventy percent of the workers in the factory aired their grievances in the group, and the workers in each group automatically requested to hold an accusation meeting.
	The accusation meeting was held eleven times in a row, and seventy-three employees in the factory made accusations at the meeting. When they accused the crimes of the four feudal remnants, Yan Qiheng, She Wenhong, Shen Yaotang, and Jiang Wenqin, the female worker Wang Ruiying pointed to the foreman Jiang Wenqin and said: "You hit us with a big wooden pole, and forced us to join your 'gathering', collect our membership fees, and buy gold bracelets to make rings." The female worker Chu Xiuying accused the hooligan She Wenhong of consistently molesting female workers and provoking the relationship between workers. In January last year, when the factory owner had difficulties in capital turnover and issued wages with loans, She Wenhong provoked the situation, inciting ordinary workers with low wages to demand the same wages as technicians, causing ordinary workers and technicians to conflict and fight. In the accusations, the workers revealed the crimes of the bad foreman Shen Yaotang. Shen Yaotang even seduced a female worker after liberation; when the trade union was re-elected, he incited the workers to elect this one and not that one; he also exploited the wages of the worker Huang Jingen. The workers also revealed the criminal facts of the bad element Yan Qiheng arbitrarily raising and lowering workers' wages and unjustifiably dismissing Zhang Huiqin, forcing Zhang Huiqin to almost commit suicide.
	After fighting against bad elements in this way, the factory changed the previous phenomenon of disunity between employees and between workers. The workers all said: "We were used by bad elements in the past, and we will no longer be fooled into making opinions."
	Then, the factory convened a labor-management consultation meeting in early July. After this period of facts, the capitalist broke the concerns of being fought against, and completely agreed with the workers' opinions; and also said: "These people have done so many bad things in the factory, this is also our negligence in management."
	Liu Changyuan, the director of the factory affairs, and Hu Cuiying, who had beaten and scolded people, and five other people who were reported in the accusations were also given appropriate punishments according to the severity of their cases.
	In the struggle against feudalism, the workers reflected that many systems were unreasonable. After discussion at the employee representative meeting, everyone unanimously proposed the opinion of reforming the old system: (1) Abolish the management method of beating and scolding workers; (2) Abolish the foreman system and establish a workshop foreman system (must be those who have technology, are supported by the masses, nominated by the trade union, negotiated by labor and management, and appointed by the capitalist); (3) The capitalist shall not arbitrarily increase, decrease, delay, or deduct wages, and any changes must be negotiated by labor and management; (4) The capitalist shall not arbitrarily recruit and dismiss employees, and when recruiting and dismissing employees due to production needs, they must act in accordance with the Trade Union Law; (5) Abolish the reward system, implement the small weekly rest system, and wages will be paid during the vacation period; (6) Overtime work shall not exceed three days per month, and when it exceeds, it must be approved by the trade union and the labor bureau; (7) Gradually implement a piece-rate wage system based on the principle of pay according to work. These opinions were all passed by the employee representative meeting, and after consultation between labor and management, the systems that should be abolished were abolished, and the opinions that should be implemented were implemented.
	The workers' awareness was also continuously improved during the movement. Some workers automatically reviewed their past shortcomings of liking to scold people and not producing well at group meetings. After the factory resumed production (after being shut down for a month and a half due to lack of raw cotton), the workers were particularly enthusiastic about production, and the production enthusiasm was generally improved. Peng Huimin and He Guoqin were unwilling to rest even when they were sick. The capitalist agent said happily: "In the beginning, I was afraid that democratic reform would affect production and that I would be fought against. But in a short process, all concerns were broken. Facts have proved that democratic reform has opened up a new path for Tian Tong Yarn Factory to strengthen labor-management unity and improve production." The experience of the factory in implementing democratic reform proves that private enterprises must also implement democratic reform.

　　开封私营天同纱厂的事实证明
    私营企业也应进行民主改革
    该厂斗争了封建残余分子，劳资协商废除了不合理的旧制度，工人生产情绪提高。
    河南开封私营天同纱厂在民主改革运动中，充分发动工人群众，进行诉苦，提高了工人的觉悟，并斗争了封建反动分子，劳资双方共同协商，废除不合理的旧制度，为今后生产开辟了新的道路。
    在民主改革之前，该厂各种工作都开展不起来，劳资双方经常发生纠纷，工人也不团结。虽然上级工会或其他有关单位的干部经常来该厂协助工作，但解决不了什么具体问题。有些干部认为：“天同工人落后，不团结光闹问题。”有的认为“天同厂的工会不起作用，不能代表全体工人利益，不能教育和提高工人。”总之，大家一致感觉“问题复杂，工作难搞”。在抗美援朝运动中，开封市工会工作组至该厂工作，听到工人们说：“上级只来了解情况，不给解决问题。”工人李鹤亭对工作组干部说：“你们工作同志别走，很好地解决一下我厂不合理的事情！”工作组干部反问他：“到底有那些不合理的事？”他咳了一声说：“好人那敢说话！？”根据这种情况，工作组认为主要是厂中还有封建残余势力直接压迫着工人，并分化工人的团结。因此，必须充分发动工人，彻底进行民主改革。工作组就通过该厂工会，发动工人进行了抗美援朝和镇压反革命的学习，针对工人过去所受的苦难进行政治教育，向大家提出“我们受过什么苦”，“谁给我们的苦”，“我们还愿意继续受苦吗？”……等问题，要工人们进行讨论。另外，工作组同志批判了单纯责备群众落后，不深入群众的工作作风。经过启发教育，工人打破顾虑，开始诉苦。
    在控诉中就连带地揭发了那些依然在厂内压迫工人的封建残余分子。例如女工钱仁弟，最初不愿诉苦，怕诉出来不顶事，经过工会干部和她谈话，她打破顾虑，诉了自己在厂中所受的压迫，又大胆揭发了女把头姜文琴怎样克扣她们的工资，虐打和辱骂女工。
    接着就有很多工人起来诉苦，诉苦的人也自动地去动员别人诉苦。男工许耀良说：“诉吧！这一次非彻底翻身不可！”情绪非常高涨。该厂百分之七十的工人在小组内都诉了苦，各组工人自动要求开控诉大会。
    控诉大会一连开了十一次，全厂有七十三个职工在大会上进行了控诉。当他们诉说到封建残余分子严其恒、佘文鸿、沈耀堂、姜文琴等四人的罪恶时，女工汪瑞英，指着把头姜文琴说：“你用大木杆打我们，还强迫我们加入你的‘聚会’，收我们的会钱，买金镯打戒指。”女工储秀英控诉流氓佘文鸿一贯调戏女工，挑拨工人间的关系。去年一月间，该厂资方因为资金周转不开，贷款发放工资，佘文鸿就从中挑拨，煽动工资少的普通工要求和技工拿一样多的工资，因而使得普通工和技术工互相冲突，打起架来。工人们在控诉中揭发了坏领班沈耀堂的罪恶。沈耀堂在解放后还诱奸一个女工；改选工会时，他煽动工人选这个不要选那个；他还剥削过工人黄金根的工资。工人们还揭发了坏分子严其恒随便升降工人工资以及无理解雇张惠琴，逼得张惠琴几乎自杀等罪恶事实。
    经过这样地斗争坏分子之后，该厂改变了以前职工之间和工人之间互不团结的现象。工人们都说：“我们从前受了坏分子的利用，以后不再上当闹意见了。”
    接着，该厂就在七月初召开劳资协商会议。资方经过这一段事实，打破了怕斗到自己身上的顾虑，完全同意工人的意见；并且还说：“这些人在工厂里做了这么多的坏事，这也是我们管理上的疏忽。”
    在控诉中检举出来的该厂事务主任刘昌源和打骂过人的胡翠英等五人，也分别轻重给予适当的处分。
    在反封建的斗争中，工人们反映出很多制度不合理。在职工代表会议上进行了讨论后，大家一致提出改革旧制度的意见：（一）废除打骂工人的管理方法；（二）废除工头制，建立车间领班制（必须是有技术，群众拥护者，工会提名，劳资协商和资方任命的人任领班）；（三）资方不得随便增加、降低、缓发或扣除工资，如有变动必须经过劳资协商；（四）资方不得随便招雇和解雇职工，如因生产需要招雇解雇职工时必须按照工会法办事；（五）废除赏工制度，执行小礼拜制，休假期间工资照发；（六）每月加工加点不超过三天，超过时须经工会同意、劳动局批准；（七）以按劳付酬原则逐步实行计件工资制。这些意见均经职工代表会议通过，劳资双方协商，该废除的制度就废除，该实行的意见就实行。
    工人们在运动中觉悟也不断提高，有些工人在小组会上自动地检讨自己过去爱骂人不好好生产的缺点。工厂复工生产后（因原棉缺乏停工一个半月），工人们生产分外起劲，生产情绪普遍提高。彭慧敏、何国琴有病也不愿休息。资方代理人高兴地说：“刚开始时，害怕民主改革会影响生产，怕斗争到自己。但是短短的过程中，一切顾虑都打破了。事实证明，民主改革给天同纱厂加强劳资团结搞好生产开辟了一条新的道路。”该厂实行民主改革的经验，证明了私营企业也必须实行民主改革。
