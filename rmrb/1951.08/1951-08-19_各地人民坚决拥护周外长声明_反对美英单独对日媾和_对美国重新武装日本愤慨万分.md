Xinhua News Agency, 18th: People across the country firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement of August 15, opposing the US and British imperialists' separate peace treaty with Japan.

The local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Shanghai have all issued written opinions. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang warned: If the US and British imperialists dare to disregard our Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement and continue their acts of aggression, they will surely reap the bitter fruit! The Shanghai Municipal Democratic Women's Federation pointed out in its statement: This year, on March 8th, more than 300,000 women in Shanghai participated in a demonstration against the US arming of Japan, which fully demonstrated the determination of Shanghai women to oppose the aggressors. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, representing one million workers, declared: Workers are determined to oppose the US imperialists' separate peace treaty with Japan through practical actions such as deeply developing the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, implementing the patriotic convention, and completing the production increase and donation plan. Farmers in the suburbs stated that they would better complete land reform and achieve production increase plans. Business circles pledged to complete the patriotic donation plan of 270 airplanes.

After seeing the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan, people from all walks of life in Nanjing were filled with indignation. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement saying: Our city's workers firmly oppose the US imperialists' conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan! The statements of the Farmers' Association and the Democratic Women's Federation all solemnly stated: We must not forget the hatred of the Japanese invaders who massacred 300,000 of our elders, brothers, and sisters in Nanjing in 1937, and we absolutely cannot tolerate the US imperialists re-arming Japan!

People from all over Southern Jiangsu also raised solemn protests against the US's separate peace treaty with Japan. The person in charge of the Wuxi Textile Industry Association said: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese invaders looted more than 174,000 spindles and more than 8,000 silk reeling machines from Wuxi, severely ravaging the textile industry. Do we still want this catastrophe to happen again? No, all the people in the industrial and commercial circles in Southern Jiangsu cannot allow the re-arming of the Japanese aggressors! A citizen named Zou Xingzuo, who had been stabbed seven times by the Japanese invaders and became blind, immediately asked someone to write a letter to the Southern Jiangsu Daily after hearing Foreign Minister Zhou's statement in the reading group, saying: I firmly oppose the US imperialists re-arming Japan. I will never forget my enemies!

Cheng Qian, Chairman of the Hunan Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, said in a written statement: The people of Hunan pledge to continue to implement the three major movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries in practical actions to support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and strive for the realization of a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan.

The people of Shenyang, who had long suffered from the persecution of the Japanese invaders, expressed extreme indignation when they heard that the US and British imperialists were attempting to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan. Guo Guilan, a model worker in a factory in the city, said: "More than 100 female workers in our workshop have been beaten by Japanese devils. We will never allow the United States to use any tricks to help Japanese fascists revive!" Sun Ping, Secretary-General of the Shenyang Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, who participated in the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army, said: "China has sacrificed the most, suffered the greatest losses, and contributed the most in the War of Resistance Against Japan. We will never recognize a peace treaty with Japan without the participation of the Chinese people!"

The eight people's organizations of Chahar Province jointly issued a statement saying: "We have suffered from the Japanese devils for more than ten years. The great massacres created by the Japanese invaders in Tianzhen, Yangyuan and other places, the 'no-man's land' created in Longguan, Chicheng, Sihai, Yanqing and other areas, the 'ten-thousand-people pit' that persecuted workers in the Pangjiabao mine, and other countless blood debts are forever remembered in the hearts of the Chinese people. We firmly oppose this heinous act of the US and British imperialists in concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan and attempting to re-arm Japan!"

People from all walks of life in Shandong, Shanxi, Henan and other provinces have also expressed their support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and firmly opposed the conspiracy of the US and British imperialists to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan.

[Reported by this newspaper] The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, representing literary and art workers across the country, firmly supports the "Statement on the US-UK Draft Peace Treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference" issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on August 15, saying: We are even more convinced that this statement will be warmly supported by the Chinese and Soviet people, the Asian people, and the people of the world. We cannot accept the one-sided draft peace treaty with Japan announced by the US government! The conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and re-arm Japan will surely be shattered! The people of China and the Soviet Union, the Japanese people, the Asian people, and all peace-loving people in the world will unite and work together until the realization of a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan!

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Xiruo and 35 other professors of Tsinghua University recently issued a statement on the issue of the US and British governments unilaterally formulating a draft peace treaty with Japan and preparing to convene the San Francisco Conference, saying: "With incomparable anger, we lodge the most serious protest against this betrayal of international obligations and arrogant and absurd act by the US and British imperialists." "We formally declare that we firmly oppose this unilateral draft peace treaty with Japan formulated by the US and British imperialists, and we will never recognize any decision made at the so-called San Francisco Conference that excludes the People's Republic of China." The statement said: Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on August 15 correctly represents the will of the Chinese people, "We pledge to support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement with practical actions, continue to expand and deepen the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea and defend our homes and country, and resolutely carry out the struggle to liberate Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other unliberated Chinese territories. We will unite with the people of the Soviet Union, the people of Asia, including the Japanese people, and strive to conclude a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible." The signatories to the above statement are Zhang Xiruo, Jin Yuelin, Chen Daisun, Zhou Peiyuan, Zhang Zigao, Zhuang Qianding, Pan Guangdan, Li Guangtian, Liu Xianzhou, Zhang Wei, Hua Luogeng, Deng Yizhe, Feng Youlan, Yu Guanying, Wu Zuxiang, Pu Jiangqing, Lv Shuxiang, Yang Yezhi, Sheng Chenghua, Shao Xunzheng, Lei Haizong, Sun Yutang, Ding Zeliang, Zhao Fangxiong, Yu Ruihuang, Huang Ziqing, Shen Tong, Chen Tiqiang, Xiao Jiakui, Wu Jingchao, Xia Zhenhuan, Chu Zhongrui, Cao Benxi, Hou Xianglin, Shen Yuan, Liang Sicheng, and 36 others.

Students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Northern Jiaotong University, Beijing Railway College and other schools expressed infinite anger after seeing the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan. Many departments of Tsinghua University held discussions, and the students unanimously expressed their support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and opposed the US-UK separate peace treaty with Japan.

The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a statement saying: The industrial and commercial circles of the capital unanimously and wholeheartedly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. The statement said: "We believe that the conspiracy of the US and Britain to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and convene the San Francisco Conference is a completely shameless act of tearing up international agreements, and when combined with a series of delaying, blackmailing, and intimidating behaviors shown by US imperialism in the Korean peace talks, it precisely shows that the US imperialist policy of aggression and aggressive actions are still continuing without any cessation. In particular, it even more nakedly reflects the attitude, actions, and conspiracy of US and British imperialism to be hostile to the Chinese people. This fact is worthy of our attention and vigilance." The statement continued: In addition to firmly supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, the industrial and commercial circles of our capital will work harder to deepen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, especially to realize the three major appeals of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Branch, and directly and indirectly consolidate and strengthen the strength of national defense in order to smash the aggressive conspiracy of the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism.
