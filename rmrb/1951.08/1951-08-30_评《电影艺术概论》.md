　　Review of "An Outline of Film Art"
       Li Qing
    Gu Zhongyi, published by Qunyi Publishing House (May 1950)
    Gu Zhongyi's "An Outline of Film Art" is an erroneous book on film art theory. It contains a tendency to worship the decadent film art of Britain and the United States.
    In the "Preface" and "Conclusion," the author repeatedly states that he only discusses the technical aspects of film in this book, and does not discuss the political content, social function, and other issues of film. This attitude is fundamentally wrong. It is inconceivable that in writing a book on film art theory, the author can fail to emphasize the political tasks undertaken by film art, can remain completely silent about the political purpose and content of art, and simply discuss "techniques." It is precisely because of this that the content of this book is deeply mired in the quagmire of political and ideological errors.
    According to the author, "This book is based on Pudovkin's 'Film Technique,' Ernest Lindgren's 'The Art of the Film,' and Roger Manvell's 'Film,' plus a little practical experience I have gained in the studio and in the developing, printing, and editing rooms over the years." The author also specifically stated: "Among them, the chapters, sections, theories, and examples are mostly based on Lindgren's 'The Art of the Film,' because Lindgren is the most progressive among British film theorists, and this book was published in 1948, which is relatively new and complete." Therefore, the author does not hesitate to use almost two-thirds of the space to introduce "the great American director Griffith" and "the famous British films 'Brief Encounter' and 'Dead of Night'," as well as "famous actors Paul Muni, Garbo..." etc., and to "report in detail on the organizational overview, organization methods, and production process of American film companies...", kowtowing to Hollywood's film art that serves imperialism. The broad masses of the Chinese people have already abandoned this kind of art, but our author "discusses" it with relish!
    We are not opposed to learning from foreign things (including the enemy's things), and we need to learn from foreign progressive things to enrich ourselves. Chairman Mao has long told us: "...We must never refuse to learn from the ancients and foreigners, even the things of the feudal class and the bourgeoisie must be learned. But this is only for reference and not for substitution, and it must never be substituted. In literature and art, the uncritical hard copying, imitation, and substitution of the dead and foreigners are the most unpromising and most harmful literary dogmatism and artistic dogmatism, and are of the same nature as dogmatism in military, political, philosophical, and economic affairs." But what is being transported in this book? It not only introduces nothing about the film art of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries in the last one or two decades, but also, apart from "the great director Griffith," what is brought over from the "most progressive" "Lindgren's 'The Art of the Film'" are only some "strange beds," "detective novel 'The Brotosski Case'," "The Adventures of Talullu," "Lonely Villa," and so on. Is this also what we need?
    The author does not understand the essence of the people's art. He is enthusiastic about what "human nature" is, what "the truth of life" is. He quoted some words from Pudovkin, but he could not thoroughly explain it; he also quoted many bourgeois "artists," but did not criticize them at all—how could he criticize them? What occupies the author's mind is precisely a set of bourgeois views on art. The reason why the author's "discussion" is full of many contradictions is precisely because he has simply put together some revolutionary artistic theories and reactionary artistic theories and listed them together.
    "Art is just creating some kind of meaningful expression of the whole from the scattered fragments of life." "...Film not only tells stories, but also seeks to get to the bottom of things, to explore the depths of the story, to explore human nature, to explore motives." "Artists—poets, painters, novelists, sculptors, composers—have always liked to work alone, not with others and do not need to cooperate closely with others..." "Apart from the Soviet Union, the most developed film industry in the world is the United States. However, all American films are privately owned..." etc., all illustrate the author's superficiality in political and artistic thought and the errors in his standpoint and views.
    This book also has a bad tendency, that is, to unnecessarily annotate English after some common translated nouns that general readers can understand. For example, when the author mentions Pudovkin's film "Mother," he writes "Mother" after it; after "Kerensky Government," he annotates "Kerensky Government." What is the need for this?
    We should oppose this book that spreads erroneous artistic ideas, and also oppose this irresponsible writing attitude and careless publishing style.

### 评《电影艺术概论》

　　评《电影艺术概论》
       李青
    顾仲彝著  群益出版社刊行（一九五○年五月）
    顾仲彝著的《电影艺术概论》，是一本错误的电影艺术理论书。它含有崇拜英美腐朽电影艺术的倾向。
    在《序》和《结论》中，作者一再说明他在本书中只谈电影技术方面的问题，而不谈电影的政治内容、社会作用等等问题。这个态度就是根本错误的。不能设想，写一本关于电影艺术理论的书籍，作者可以不着重提出由电影艺术所担负的政治任务，可以绝口不谈艺术的政治目的与内容，而单纯地去论列“技巧”。正是因为这样，这本书的内容就深陷在政治思想错误的泥淖里。
    据作者说，“这本书是根据普特甫金的《电影技术》、厄纳斯脱·林葛伦的《电影艺术》和罗哲尔·孟佛儿的《电影》三书，再加上我几年来在摄影场上和洗印剪接间里摸索得来的一点实际经验，而写成的。”作者还特别申明说：“其中分章分段、理论和举例，大部分是根据林葛伦的《电影艺术》，因为林葛伦在英国电影理论家中是比较最进步的一个，并且这本书是一九四八年才出版，比较的最新最完备。”因此，作者不惜以几乎三分之二的篇幅去介绍“美国大导演格列斐斯”和“英国名片《相见恨晚》与《七重心》”，以及“名演员保罗茂尼、嘉宝……”等等，并且把“美国电影公司的组织概况、组织方法、以及制片过程，作一详尽的报道……”，拜倒在好莱坞的为帝国主义服务的电影艺术之下。广大的中国人民已经唾弃了这种艺术，而我们的作者却“论述”得津津有味！
    我们不反对学习外国的东西（包括敌人的东西在内），而且我们需要学习外国的进步的东西来丰富我们自己。毛主席早就告诉我们说：“……我们决不可拒绝借鉴古人与外国人，那怕是封建阶级与资产阶级的东西也必须借鉴。但这仅仅是借鉴而不是替代，这是决不能替代的。文学艺术中对于死人与外国人的毫无批判的硬搬、模仿与替代，乃是最没有出息的最害人的文学教条主义与艺术教条主义，和军事上政治上哲学上经济学上的教条主义的性质是一样的。”可是在这本书里所搬运过来的是些什么呢？它不但对近一、二十年来苏联及其他人民民主国家的电影艺术毫无介绍，而从“最进步的”“林葛伦的《电影艺术》”里所搬过来的，除了“大导演格列斐斯”之外，也只是一些“古怪的床”、“侦探小说《百劳特斯基案》”、《陶列的冒险》、《孤独的别墅》等等之类的东西。难道这也是我们需要的东西么？
    作者不懂得什么是人民的艺术的本质。他热中于什么“人性”，什么“人生的真理”。他引用了普特甫金的一些词句，但却不能彻底解释它；他也引用了许多资产阶级“艺术家”的话，却没有加以丝毫的批判——他怎么去批判呢？占据着作者的头脑的，正是一套资产阶级的艺术观。作者在他的《论述》中所以充满了许多矛盾，正是因为他把一些革命的艺术理论和反动的艺术理论，生硬地加到一起，罗列起来罢了。
    “艺术就是把人生的零散片断创造出某种整体的有意义的表达而已。”“……电影不仅讲故事，并且要寻根究底，发掘到故事的深奥之处，发掘人性，发掘动机。”“艺术家——诗人、画家、小说家、雕刻家、作曲家——一向都喜欢单独工作，不和人家也不需要和人家作密切的合作……”“除了苏联以外，世界上电影事业最发达的要算美国了。不过美国的电影全部是民营的……”等等，都说明了作者政治和艺术思想的肤浅和立场观点的错误。
    这本书还有一种不良倾向，那就是在一些常见的一般读者都能懂的翻译名词后面不必要地注上英文，例如作者在提到普特甫金导演的《母亲》时，后面要写上个“Mother”，在《克伦斯基政府》后面，要注上“Kerensky Goverment”，究竟，这有什么必要呢？
    我们应该反对这本散布错误艺术思想的书，也反对这种不负责任的著作态度和轻率的出版作风。
