Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 21st: The full text of General Li Xiangchao, the representative of the Korean People's Army, at the memorial meeting for Martyr Yao Qingxiang held by people from all walks of life in Kaesong City, is as follows:

　　Yao Qingxiang, platoon leader of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, an outstanding son of the great Chinese people and a beloved comrade-in-arms of the Korean people, sacrificed his life on a hillside near Panmunjom in the Kaesong neutral zone. The American aggressors violated the agreement they had announced to the people of the world, invaded the Kaesong neutral zone, and took the precious life of Platoon Leader Yao, who was loyal to his mission.

　　The enemy's intentions are insidious, and the enemy's actions are ugly. We express our utmost anger at this!

　　The cause to which Comrade Yao Qingxiang dedicated himself is just, and the purpose of the common struggle of the Chinese and Korean people is legitimate, and therefore it is bound to be victorious. Comrade Yao Qingxiang's blood will not be shed in vain, and we will never let Comrade Yao Qingxiang's blood be shed in vain. The brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, forged with blood, will be even more consolidated. The great united strength of the Chinese and Korean people is invincible to any enemy!

　　The Korean armistice talks currently being held in Kaesong are a continuation of the solemn struggle against the aggressive war policies of the American and British aggressors. The enemy is ferocious and cunning, and we have no illusions about the enemy. The delegation of our Korean and Chinese People's Armies is fighting to achieve our common goals and strengthen world peace.

　　The bloody incident in which the enemy killed Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang clearly exposed their attitude towards the armistice talks. Comrade Yao Qingxiang's death exposed the enemy's mask regarding the armistice talks to the world. Peace-loving people all over the world will unanimously condemn the enemy's crimes.

　　Comrade Yao Qingxiang! On behalf of the armistice negotiation delegation, I assure you: Our Chinese and Korean people will definitely complete the cause you failed to complete and avenge you!

　　As a comrade and comrade-in-arms, I express my heartfelt condolences to you! Rest in peace, Comrade Yao Qingxiang!

　　李相朝将军讲话
    保证完成烈士遗志为烈士报仇
    【新华社开城二十一日电】朝鲜人民军代表李相朝将军在开城市各界追悼姚庆祥烈士大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    伟大中国人民的优秀子弟、朝鲜人民亲爱的战友、中国人民志愿军的姚庆祥排长在开城中立区板门店附近的一处山坡上牺牲了，美国侵略者违反了向全世界人民所宣布的协议，侵犯了开城中立区，夺取了忠实于自己任务的姚排长的宝贵生命。
    敌人的企图是阴险的，敌人的行动是丑恶的。我们对此表示十二万分的愤怒！
    姚庆祥同志所献身的事业是正义的，朝中两国人民共同斗争的目的是正当的，因此是必胜的。姚庆祥同志的血不会白流，我们也决不会让姚庆祥同志的血白流，以血结成的朝中两国人民的兄弟般的友谊，将更加巩固。朝中两国人民伟大团结的力量，是任何敌人所不能战胜的！
    现在正在开城举行的朝鲜停战谈判，是反对美英侵略者侵略战争政策庄严斗争的继续。敌人是凶恶而狡猾的，我们对敌人没有任何幻想。我们朝中人民军队的代表团正在为完成我们共同的目标及加强世界和平而斗争着。
    敌人杀害姚庆祥排长的流血事件，明显地暴露了他们对停战谈判的态度。姚庆祥同志的死，向全世界揭下了敌人对停战谈判的假面具，全世界爱好和平的人民将一致痛斥敌人的罪行。
    姚庆祥同志！我代表停战谈判代表团向你保证：我们朝中两国人民一定要完成你所未能完成的事业并替你报仇！
    我以同志和战友的资格向你致衷心的哀悼！安息吧！姚庆祥同志！
