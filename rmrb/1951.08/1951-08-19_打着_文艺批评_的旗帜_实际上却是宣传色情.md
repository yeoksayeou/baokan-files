    Flying the banner of "literary criticism"
    But actually promoting pornography
    Editor:
    The twelfth issue of *Xinmin Bao*'s "Literary Criticism" (August 18th), used nearly half of its space to publish an article by Liu Yong entitled "Eliminating Pornographic Toxins in Old Literature." The author listed a large number of appalling examples of so-called "pornographic toxins in old literature" but did not propose any ways to eliminate them. This article is extremely vile and vulgar. I do not understand why the *Xinmin Bao*'s "Literary Criticism" supplement can tolerate such a vulgar author, flying the banner of "literary criticism," yet actually promoting pornographic things?!
    Pornographic old ballads and drum lyrics should be resolutely banned by the relevant departments, and should definitely not be promoted and introduced like Liu Yong did.
    *Xinmin Bao*'s "Literary Criticism" published this article and placed it as the first one, which proves that the editor-in-chief of the publication also takes the same attitude as Liu Yong. This fact shows that the newspaper's editorial department still lacks the necessary responsible attitude towards readers and still lacks sufficient awareness of the seriousness of propaganda work.
                                             Běifēng

### 打着“文艺批评”的旗帜  实际上却是宣传色情

    打着“文艺批评”的旗帜
    实际上却是宣传色情编辑同志：
    新民报《文艺批评》第十二期，（八月十八日）以将近二分之一的篇幅，刊载了流涌的以《清除旧文艺中的色情毒素》为题的文字一篇，作者大量地列举了不堪入目的所谓“旧文艺中的色情毒素”的许多例子，却没有提出如何清除的办法来。这篇文字是十分恶劣下流的，我不懂得为什么新民报的《文艺批评》副刊能够容忍这样下流的作者，打着“文艺批评”的旗帜，居然大肆宣传色情的东西？！
    对于色情的旧唱本鼓词应由有关部门坚决加以取缔，决不应该像流涌这样地加以宣传介绍。
    新民报的《文艺批评》刊登了这篇文章，而且排在第一篇，足证该刊主编人也是与流涌采取同样的态度的。这件事实说明了该报编辑部对读者还缺少必要的负责态度，对宣传工作的严重性也还缺少足够的认识。
