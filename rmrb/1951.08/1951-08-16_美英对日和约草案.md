Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The draft peace treaty with Japan, published by the US and British governments on July 12th. The original text is as follows:

　　　　　Preamble

The Allied Powers and Japan are resolved that their future relations shall be those of sovereign, equal states, and shall be conducted in cooperation under a friendly association so as to promote their common welfare and to maintain international peace and security. They are therefore desirous of concluding a Treaty of Peace which will settle questions still outstanding as a result of the existence of a state of war between them, and will enable Japan to realize its aspirations to become a member of the United Nations and in all circumstances to comply with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations; to strive to realize the objectives stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; to seek to create within Japan conditions of stability and well-being as defined in Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter of the United Nations and already initiated by Japanese legislation subsequent to surrender; and in public and private trade and commerce to conform to internationally accepted fair practices.

The Allied Powers welcome the intentions of Japan set out in the preceding paragraph.

Therefore, the Allied Powers and Japan have agreed to conclude the present Treaty of Peace, and have accordingly appointed the undersigned Plenipotentiaries, who, after presentation of their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed on the following provisions:

Article 11

Article 12

(a) Japan declares its readiness promptly to enter into negotiations with each of the Allied Powers for the conclusion of treaties or agreements to place their trade, navigation, and other commercial relations on a stable and friendly basis.

　(i) Accord to each of the Allied Powers, its nationals, products and vessels:
　　(a). Most-favored-nation treatment with respect to customs duties, taxes, restrictions and other regulations on or in connection with the importation and exportation of goods;
　　(b) National treatment with respect to shipping, navigation and imported goods, and with respect to natural and juridical persons and their interests—such treatment to include all matters pertaining to the levying and collection of taxes, access to the courts, the making and performance of contracts, rights to property, participation in juridical entities organized under Japanese law, and generally the conduct of all kinds of business and professional activities.
　(ii) Ensure that external purchases and sales of Japanese state trading enterprises shall be based solely on commercial considerations.
(c) In no event shall Japan be obliged to grant national treatment or most-favored-nation treatment to any Allied Power to the extent that such Allied Power does not grant Japan national treatment or most-favored-nation treatment, as the case may be, in respect of the same subject matter. The reciprocity principle contained in the preceding sentence shall be determined, in the case of products, vessels and juridical entities of, and persons domiciled in, any non-metropolitan territory of any Allied Power, and in the case of juridical entities of, and persons domiciled in, any state or province of any Allied Power which has a federal system, by reference to the treatment accorded to Japan in such territory, state or province.
(d) In applying this Article, a discriminatory measure shall not be considered to derogate from the grant of national treatment or most-favored-nation treatment, if such discriminatory measure is based on an exception customarily provided for in the commercial treaties of the party applying it, or is based on the need to safeguard that party’s external financial position or balance of payments, except in respect of shipping and navigation, or is based on the need to maintain its essential security interests, and provided such measure is consonant with the principles stated in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 18 of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, and is appropriate to the circumstances, and is not applied in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner.
(e) The obligations of Japan under paragraph (b) of this Article shall not be affected by the exercise of any Allied Power of any rights under Article 14 of the present Treaty; nor shall the provisions of that Article be understood as limiting the obligations of Japan under this Article.

(b) Pending the conclusion of such agreement or agreements, Japan will, for a period of four years, extend to such Power treatment not less favorable than that which was afforded on the date of coming into force of the present Treaty to such Power with respect to air transport rights and privileges, and will accord complete equality of opportunity in the operation and development of air transport services.
(c) Pending its becoming a party to the Convention on International Civil Aviation in accordance with Article 93 thereof, Japan will give effect to the provisions of that Convention applicable to international air navigation, and will conform to the standards, practices and procedures attached thereto as Annexes to the Convention.

　　　　　Chapter V Claims and Property

Article 14

(a) It is recognized that Japan should pay reparations to the Allied Powers for the damage and suffering caused by it during the war. Nevertheless it is also recognized that the resources of Japan are not presently sufficient, if it is to maintain a viable economy, to make complete reparation for all such damage and suffering and at the same time meet its other obligations.

Accordingly,

(i) Japan will promptly enter into negotiations with Allied Powers so desiring whose present territories were occupied by Japan and suffered damage by Japan, with a view to assisting to compensate those countries for the cost of repairing the damage done, by making available the services of the Japanese people in production, salvaging and other work for the Allied Powers in question. Such arrangements shall avoid the imposition of additional burdens on other Allied Powers, and, where the manufacturing of raw materials is required, they shall be supplied by the Allied Powers in question, so as not to throw any foreign exchange burden upon Japan.
(ii)
　1. Each of the Allied Powers shall have the right to seize, retain, liquidate or otherwise dispose of all property, rights and interests of

　　(a) Japan and Japanese nationals,
　　(b) persons acting for or on behalf of Japan or Japanese nationals, and
　　(c) entities owned or controlled by Japan or Japanese nationals,

which on the coming into force of the present Treaty are subject to its jurisdiction, except:

　　(i) Property of Japanese nationals who during the war resided with the permission of the government concerned in the territory of one of the Allied Powers, other than territory occupied by Japan, except where the treatment accorded to such property during the war was generally less favorable than that accorded to other residents of that territory;
　　(ii) All real property, furniture and fixings owned by the Japanese Government and used for diplomatic or consular purposes, and all personal furniture and furnishings and other private property which are exclusively necessary for the performance of diplomatic and consular functions;
　　(iii) Property belonging to religious bodies or private charitable institutions and used exclusively for religious or charitable purposes;
　　(iv) Property rights which have arisen since the resumption of trade and financial relations between the country concerned and Japan, but any rights arising out of transactions contrary to the laws of the Allied Power concerned shall not be included;
　　(v) Obligations of Japan or of Japanese nationals, any right, title and interest in tangible property located in Japan, interests in enterprises organized under the laws of Japan, or any paper evidence thereof; provided that this exception shall only apply to obligations of Japan and its nationals expressed in Japanese currency.
　2. The property excepted in sub-paragraphs (i) through (v) above shall be returned subject to payment of reasonable expenses for its preservation and administration. If any such property has been liquidated the proceeds shall be returned instead.
　3. The right to seize, retain, liquidate or otherwise dispose of Japanese property as provided in this paragraph shall be exercised in accordance with the laws of the Allied Power concerned. The Japanese owners thereof shall have only such rights as may be given them by those laws.
　4. The Allied Powers agree to give sympathetic consideration to claims of Japanese nationals for preferential treatment with regard to their literary and artistic property rights.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in the present Treaty, the Allied Powers waive all reparations claims of the Allied Powers, other claims of the Allied Powers and their nationals arising out of any actions taken by Japan and its nationals during the course of the prosecution of the war, and claims of the Allied Powers for direct military costs of occupation.

Article 15

(a) Upon application by any of the Allied Powers, made within nine months of the coming into force of the present Treaty, Japan will, within six months of the date of such application, return the property, tangible and intangible, and all rights or interests of any kind, of the Allied Powers and their nationals which was within Japan at any time between December 7, 1941, and September 2, 1945, unless the owner has freely disposed thereof without duress or fraud. Such property shall be returned free of all wartime charges and expenses, and without any discrimination or expense. The Government of Japan may dispose of property, for which no claim has been filed, in such manner as it may determine. Where such property was within Japan on December 7, 1941, and cannot be returned or has suffered damage, Japan will compensate the owner in accordance with Law No. ×× enacted by the Japanese Diet on ×, 1951.
(b) With respect to industrial property rights impaired during the war, Japan will continue to accord to the Allied Powers and their nationals benefits no less favorable than those heretofore accorded by Cabinet Orders No. 309 effective September 1, 1949, No. 12 effective January 28, 1950, and No. 9 effective February 1, 1950, and all amendments thereto, provided such nationals have applied for such benefits within the time specified therein.
(c)
　(i) Japan recognizes that the literary and artistic property rights which existed in Japan on December 6, 1941, in respect of the published and unpublished works of the Allied Powers and their nationals have continued in force since that date, and recognizes those rights which have arisen, or but for the war would have arisen, in Japan since that date by virtue of any convention or agreement to which Japan was a party on that date, irrespective of whether or not such convention or agreement was abrogated or suspended upon or since the outbreak of war by Japan or by the Allied Power concerned.
　(ii) Without any request by the proprietor and without the payment of any fee or compliance with any other formality, the period from December 7, 1941, until the date of coming into force of the present Treaty shall be excluded from the normal term of rights; and such period, plus an additional period of six months, shall be excluded from the time within which a literary work must be translated into Japanese in order to obtain translating rights in Japan.

(Note: Paragraph (a) of this Article is dependent on the acceptability of legislation to be enacted by the Japanese Diet. Paragraph (b) assumes that the time for applying under the Cabinet Orders mentioned can be extended to September 30, 1951.)

Article 16

As an expression of its desire to indemnify those members of the armed forces of the Allied Powers who suffered undue hardships while prisoners of war of Japan, Japan will transfer its assets and those of its nationals in countries which were neutral during the war, or which were at war with any of the Allied Powers, or the equivalent of such assets, to the International Committee of the Red Cross which shall liquidate such assets and distribute the resultant fund to former prisoners of war and their families on such basis as it may determine to be equitable. The categories of assets to be transferred shall be limited to those listed in Article 14(a) 2 (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) and (v) of the present Treaty. It is understood that the transfer provisions of this Article shall not apply to the 19,770 shares in the Bank for International Settlements now owned by Japanese financial institutions.

(Note: The legal status of Japanese assets in Thailand will be the subject of separate consideration.)

Article 17

(a) Upon the request of any of the Allied Powers, the Japanese Government will review and revise in conformity with international law any decision or order rendered by a prize court of Japan in any case involving ownership rights of nationals of such Allied Power and will furnish copies of all documents composing the record of such cases, including the decisions or orders rendered. In any case in which such review or revision shows that restoration is due, the provisions of Article 15 shall apply to the property concerned.
(b) The Japanese Government will take the necessary measures to enable nationals of any of the Allied Powers at any time within one year from the date of coming into force of the present Treaty to submit to the appropriate Japanese authorities for review any judgment rendered on or after December 7, 1941, in any case in which such national was not adequately represented either as plaintiff or defendant in the proceedings. The Japanese Government shall provide that, where the national has suffered injury by reason of the judgment, he shall be restored to the position which he would have been in had the judgment not been rendered or shall be afforded such relief as may be just and equitable in the circumstances.

Article 18

(a) It is recognized that the intervention of the state of war has not affected the obligations to pay money debts arising out of obligations and contracts (including those in respect of bonds) which at the date of coming into force of the present Treaty were owing by the Government or nationals of Japan to the Government or nationals of one of the Allied Powers, or which were owing by the Government or nationals of one of the Allied Powers to the Government or nationals of Japan, nor has it affected the obligations to consider on their merits, as the state of war has not affected, claims of the Government of one of the Allied Powers for losses or damage to property or for personal injury or death which occurred before the state of war between Japan and the Allied Power concerned, or claims of the Government of Japan for losses or damage to property or for personal injury or death which occurred before the state of war between Japan and the Allied Power concerned. The provisions of this paragraph are without prejudice to the rights conferred by Article 14 of the present Treaty.
(b) Japan affirms its liability for the pre-war external debt of the Japanese State and for debts of corporate bodies subsequently declared to be liabilities of the Japanese State, and expresses its intention to commence negotiations at an early date with its creditors with respect to the resumption of payments on those debts; to facilitate negotiations in respect of pre-war claims and debts of a private nature; and to authorize transfers of funds for the purpose of the settlement of such claims and debts.

Article 19

(a) Japan waives all claims of Japan and its nationals against the Allied Powers and their nationals arising out of the war or out of actions taken because of the existence of a state of war; and waives all claims arising from the presence, operations or other actions of forces or authorities of any of the Allied Powers in Japanese territory prior to the coming into force of the present Treaty.
(b) The foregoing waiver includes any claims arising out of actions taken by any of the Allied Powers with respect to Japanese vessels between September 1, 1939, and the coming into force of the present Treaty, as well as any claims and debts arising in respect to prisoners of war and civilian internees in the hands of the Allied Powers.
(c) Japan similarly waives, in favor of Germany and German nationals, all claims of Japan and Japanese nationals against Germany and German nationals outstanding at the date of the present Treaty, including inter-governmental claims and claims for loss or damage sustained during the war, but excepting (a) claims in respect of contracts entered into and rights acquired before September l, 1939, and (b) claims arising out of trade and financial relations between Japan and Germany after September 2, 1945

    丁、在适用本条时，如果某项差别待遇办法系基于引用该项办法一方之商约中所通常规定之一项例外，或基于保护该方之对外财政地位或支付平衡之需要（除涉及船运及航行者外）或基于切要的安全利益之需要，则此等差别待遇办法，不得视为对于国民待遇或最惠国待遇有所损害。但以该项办法适合于情况，而非出以武断或不合理之方式为限。
    戊、本条乙项所规定之日本义务，不得因本条约第十四条所规定任何盟国权利之行使而有所影响。该条各项规定，亦不得了解为限制日本因本和约第十五条所承担之义务。
    第十三条
    甲、日本遇有任何一盟国或数盟国请求缔结关于国际民用航空运输之双边或多边协定时，应立即与该盟国举行谈判。
    乙、在未与某一盟国缔结该项协定前，日本在四年期内，应给予该盟国以不低于在本条约生效时，该盟国等所行使之航空运输权利及特权之待遇，并应在经营及发展空运业务方面，给予完全平等之机会。
    丙、日本在未依照国际民用航空公约第九十三条之规定，加入该约之前，对于该公约内所适用于国际航空交通之条款，应予施行，并对于依照该公约条款作为附件规定的标准、办法及手续，亦应予以施行。
            第五章  要求及财产
    第十四条
    甲、兹承认，日本虽在原则上应对其在战争中所引起的损害及痛苦付予赔偿，但如欲维持可以生存的经济，则日本缺乏付予盟国以适当的赔偿并同时履行其他义务的能力。然而
    （一）日本将尽速与那些愿意谈判而其现有领土曾被日军占领并曾遭受日本损害的盟国进行谈判，以求利用日本人民在制造上、打捞上及对各该盟国贡献的其他服务上的技能与劳作，作为协助赔偿各该国修复其所受损害的费用。此项办法应避免以增加的负担加诸其他盟国。当需要制造原料时，应由各该盟国供给，借免以任何外汇上的负担加诸日本。
    （二）
    一、每一盟国应有权扣押、扣留、清算或以其他方法处置下列一切财产、权利及利益：
    （甲）属于日本及其国民者；
    （乙）属于日本或其国民的代理人或代表人者；
    （丙）属于为日本或其国民所有的或控制的团体者，而该项财产在本约生效时即受该盟国的管辖者，但以下各项除外：
    （子）在战争期内，经有关政府准许，在未经日本占领的盟国领土内居住之日本国民之财产，但遇有财产其所在地政府于该时期内所施行的处理办法，对其该地的其他日本国民的财产，未曾普遍适用者，则不在此列。
    （丑）属于日本政府所有并为外交或领事目的使用的一切不动产、家具与固定设备，私人家具与设备，以及其他非投资性质的、且为执行外交及领事职务所经常必需的私人财产；
    （寅）属于宗教团体或私人慈善机构，并纯为宗教或慈善目的使用的财产；
    （卯）有关国家在本约生效前，因与日本恢复商业及金融关系后而产生的财产权利，但在违反有关的盟国法律之交易中所产生的任何权利不在此列；
    （辰）日本或其国民的债务，对于日本境内有形财产的权利、权利根据及利益，对于依照日本法律所组织的企业的利益或其任何有关的书面证据，但此项除外应仅适用于日本及其国民以日本货币计算之债务。
    二、以上（子）款至（辰）款的例外提及财产应予归还，但为保存及管理此项财产而支出的合理费用得予扣除。如任何此项财产已被清算则应归还其清算所得之款。
    三、上述对日本财产的扣押、扣留、清算或以其他方式处理的权利，应依照有关的盟国之法律行使之。该日本籍所有人应仅具有那些法律所给予他的权利。
    四、各盟国同意对日本商标及其文学上与艺术上的财产权利，予以依每一盟国情形许可范围内的优遇。
    乙、除本约另有规定者外，各盟国兹放弃其一切赔偿要求，盟国及其国民对由日本及其国民在作战过程中所采行动而产生的其他要求，以及盟国对于占领的直接军事费用的要求。
    第十五条
    甲、各盟国及其国民，自一九四一年十二月七日至一九四五年九月二日间之任何期间，所有在日本之有形及无形财产及一切权利或任何种之利益，经于本约生效后九个月内提出请求者，日本应自请求之日起六个月内归还之，但如所有人未经胁迫或诈欺而业已自由处理者不在此列。此项财产应予归还，并免除因战争所加予之负担与费用，归还时亦不需任何费用。所有人在规定期间内未请求发还之财产，日本政府得自行决定处理。如此项财产于一九四一年十二月七日系在日本境内而不能归还或已遭损坏者，则当依日本议会于一九五一年×月×日制定之第××号法令给予赔偿。
    乙、关于在战时遭受损害之工业财产权利，日本对于盟国及其国民将继续给予不少于一九四九年九月一日生效之内阁命令第三○九号、一九五○年一月二十八日生效之命令第十二号及一九五○年二月一日生效之命令第九号及各该命令之所有修正所给予之利益，但以此项国民曾在规定之期限内请求此种利益者为限。
    丙、
    （一）日本承认在一九四一年十二月六日存在于日本境内有关盟国及其国民已出版或未出版之文学或艺术作品的财产权利，在该日以后继续有效，并承认在该日以后由于日本在该日仍为缔约国之任何公约或协定之效力而在日本产生的权利，或若不是因为战争而可能产生的权利，不论此类公约或协定在战争爆发时或以后曾否由日本或有关盟国以国内法予以废止或暂停其效力。
    （二）不待权利所有人申请及缴纳任何费用，或履行任何其他手续，自一九四一年十二月七日至本约生效日之期间应自其权利正常继续期间内减除之；此项期间，并另加六个月期间，应自一文艺作品为获得在日本之翻译权利而必须译成日文之期限内减除之。
    （注：本条甲项将视日本将来通过之法律是否可予接受而定。乙项则假定依有关之内阁命令提出请求，期限可展至一九五一年九月三十日。）
    第十六条
    为对盟国武装部队人员在作日本战俘期间所受过分之痛苦表示赔偿之愿望起见，日本允将在战时中立之国家或与任何盟国作战之国家内的日本及其国民所有之资产或此类资产之等价物移交红十字国际委员会，由其清理此项资产，并将所得基金，依其所认为公平之基础，分配予前战俘及其家属。但本约第十四条甲（二）一、（丑）至（辰）各款所述各类资产不在移交之列。并了解，本条关于移交之规定，不适用于现为日本金融机关所有之国际清算银行一九、七七○股份。
    （注：日本在泰国资产之法律地位应另予考虑）
    第十七条
    甲、日本政府经任一盟国之请求，对于日本捕获审检所涉及盟国国民所有权之案件所作之判决或命令，应依国际法原则予以复审及修正，并提供此项案件纪录之全部文件抄本，包括所作判决及所颁布之命令。如该复审或修正显示必须恢复权利时，则第十五条之规定应该适用于该有关之财产。
    乙、日本政府应采取一切必要措施，以便任一盟国国民在本约生效之日起一年内之任何时期，得向日本有关当局提请复审从一九四一年十二月七日起至本约生效之日期内所作之任何判决，而在该案任何程序中，该国民未能以原告或被告之身份为充分之陈述者。如该国民因此项判决而受损害，日本政府应设法使其能恢复在未作判决前之地位，或获得依其情形公允平衡之救济。
    第十八条
    甲、兹承认，由于战争状态存在前已有之义务与契约（包括有关公债者）及已取得之权利所产生，而系日本政府或其国民应付予任何一盟国政府或其国民，或系任何一盟国政府或其国民应付予日本政府或其国民的金钱债务之偿付义务，并不因战争状态之介入而受影响。对于因为在战争状态发生前发生之财产的丧失或损害或个人的受伤或死亡而由任一盟国政府向日本政府或由日本政府向任何盟国政府提出或再提出之要求，应就其案情予以考虑之义务，亦不得视为因战争状态之介入而受影响。本项之规定并不妨碍本约第十四条所授与之权利。
    乙、日本政府承认对战前日本国家的外债及随后宣布由日本国家承担之法人组织之债务负有义务，并表示愿早日与债权人就恢复偿付债务一事进行谈判；关于私人战前的要求及债务之谈判予以便利；并对于由此而发生之款项的拨汇亦予以便利。
    第十九条
    甲、日本放弃日本及其国民对盟国及其国民因战争或因战争状态之存在所采行动而发生的一切要求，并放弃其由于本约生效以前任何盟国军队或当局在日本领土内之留驻、军事行动或其他行动而产生的一切要求。
    乙、上述的放弃包括对因任何盟国自一九三九年九月一日至本约生效之日对日本船舶所采取的行动而产生的任何要求，并包括因在盟国拘留下的战俘及平民所产生的任何要求与债务在内。
    丙、在相互声明放弃的条件下，日本政府代表日本政府及日本国民声明放弃其对德国及德国国民的一切要求（包括债务在内），包括政府与政府间的要求及为战时所受损失或损害之要求在内，但下列两项要求除外：
    （甲）与在一九三九年九月一日以前所订契约及所取得的权利有关的要求，及（乙）由于在一九四五年九月二日以后德国及日本间的贸易与金融关系而产生的要求。
    第二十条
    日本将采取一切必要措施，保证依照一九四五年柏林会议的议定书中有权处分德国在日本资产之各国所已或所可能决定的对该等资产之处分得以实施。又日本在该等资产未作最后处分之前，将负保存及管理之责。
    第二十一条
    虽有本约第二十五条的规定，中国仍得享有第十条及第十四条甲款二项所规定的利益；朝鲜得享有本约第二条、第九条及第十二条所规定的利益。
            第六章  争议之解决
    第二十二条
    倘本约之任何一方认为业已发生有关本约的解释及执行而不能以其他协议方法解决的争议时，该项争议应在当事任何一方的请求下，提交国际法庭裁决之。日本及尚非国际法庭规约组成国之各盟国，均将依照联合国安全理事会一九四六年十月十五日之决议，向国际法庭书记官长递送一概括宣言，声明对于有关具有本条所提及的性质之一切争议，一般的接受国际法庭的管辖权，而毋须另订特别协定。
            第七章  最后条款
    第二十三条
    甲、本约应由包括日本在内的签字国批准，并于日本及包括作为主要占领国的美国在内之下列国家中过半数国家业已缴存其批准文件后，即对各该批准国发生效力。（此处将载明下列国家中之业已签署本约者的名称）即：澳大利亚、缅甸、加拿大、锡兰、法国、印度、印尼、荷兰、新西兰、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟及美利坚合众国。对于其后批准的国家，本约即于各该国家缴存其批准文件之日起，发生效力。
    乙、如本约在日本缴存，其批准文件九个月后尚未生效，任何批准国得于日本缴存批准文件之日起三年以内以文件通知日本政府及美国政府，使本约在该国与日本间发生效力。
    第二十四条
    所有批准文件应缴存美利坚合众国政府，美利坚合众国政府将以依照本约第二十三条乙款规定所送达的批准文件及所作通知，通知所有签字国。
    第二十五条
    本约所称盟国应为曾与日本作战并已签署及批准本约之国家。除第二十一条之规定外，本约对于非本条所指盟国之任何国家，不给予任何权利、权利根据及利益；本约之任何规定亦不得有利于非本条所指盟国而废弃或损害日本之任何权利、权利根据或利益。
    第二十六条
    日本准备与任何签署或加入一九四二年一月一日联合国宣言、且对日本作战而非本约签字国之国家订立一与本约相同或大致相同之双边条约，但日本之此项义务，将于本约生效后三年届满时终止。倘日本与任何国家成立一媾和协议或战争赔偿协议，给予该国以较本约规定更大之利益时，则此等利益应同样给予本约之缔约国。
    第二十七条
    本约应存放于美利坚合众国政府档案库。美利坚合众国政府应以本约之校正副本一份送致每一签字国，并以本约依照本约第二十三条甲项规定之生效日期通知各该国。
    为此各全权代表签署本约以昭信守
