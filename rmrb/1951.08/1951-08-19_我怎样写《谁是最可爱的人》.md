　　How I Wrote "The Most Lovable People"
　　Editor's Note: Comrade Wei Wei's Korean War correspondence "The Most Lovable People" is a very well-written piece among the Korean front-line correspondences. Our editorial department invited Comrade Wei Wei in May to discuss his experience in creating this correspondence and wrote this article. We believe that his creative ideas and methods are correct and worthy of reference for journalists and literary workers.
　　The most fundamental reason I was able to write "The Most Lovable People" is that the heroic spirit and deeds of our soldiers are so great and so touching. All of this completely moved me.
　　"The Most Lovable People" is a theme that had been churning in my mind for a long time. I have been in the army for a relatively long time, and I have this feeling towards the soldiers, that our soldiers are the most lovable people. Whenever I sit with them, I feel inexplicably happy.
　　This time I went to Korea, and in the Volunteer Army, this feeling deepened even further. I felt the soldiers were even more lovable. I saw that in the Korean War, although the tasks they faced were so arduous and the combat environment was so harsh, the heroism of our soldiers had developed to an even higher level than what I had seen in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. In particular, the universality of this heroism was unprecedented. For example, I learned from a certain infantry regiment an astonishing figure: until the end of the Third Battle, the number of wounded soldiers who requested to stay in the unit was greater than the number sent to the hospital for recuperation. This is probably a miracle in the history of world wars! This fact further urged me to have an even stronger desire to express the theme of "The Most Lovable People".
　　Now, looking back at this article, it makes me even clearer about this point: In-depth feelings in real life are so important to the writer! If you feel deeply, what you write will naturally have that kind of energy, and people who read it will also feel deeply; if you feel shallowly, what people receive from you will also be shallow. If you haven't been moved at all, then there's no need to talk about it. Here, I would also like to add that in-depth feelings are closely related to in-depth interviews. Taking interviews with soldiers as an example, if you talk to them deeply, and you understand them deeply, their temperament, thoughts, and feelings will infect you, and immerse you in their emotions. In other words, it will make you feel even deeper.
　　How did I express this theme? First of all, I tried to pursue the most essential things. In Korea, I often thought about a question in my mind: Why are our soldiers so brave? They are simply not afraid of death! Where does that high degree of heroism come from? In order to find the answer, I talked a lot and held many forums. I talked to them in detail, so they could talk about what was in their hearts. Those who talked to me included commanders, combat heroes, ordinary soldiers, cadres, newly enlisted students, and people who used to be backward. I learned that although they had some differences due to different experiences and understanding, they all had a common point, that is, love for the great motherland, deep sympathy for the Korean people, and a sense of honor in being a revolutionary hero based on this. So, I realized that under the education of the Party, this great and profound patriotic and internationalist ideology and feeling is the most fundamental driving force for the fearlessness of our soldiers. I thought, isn't this the most essential thing? This is the most essential thing. I affirmed it. I must reflect it. I have no doubt. All other trivial, one-sided, and accidental things cannot change my understanding of this issue.
　　The essence of the problem has been found, so how should this most essential thing be reflected? In Korea, I wrote a correspondence called "Be Proud, Motherland," which included more than twenty examples that I thought were the most vivid. I brought it back and showed it to my comrades, and it felt bad, so I didn't publish it. Because there were too many examples piled up, it was like bookkeeping, and none of them were clearly or fully explained. Later, when writing "The Most Lovable People," I only selected a few examples, and after writing, I deleted two more. The facts tell me that using the most representative typical examples to illustrate the essential things gives people a clear and understandable impression, and it will also be prominent.
　　How to write about soldiers vividly? I feel that not only should the heroic actions of the soldiers be written, but also the heroic thoughts and feelings in the heroic actions of the soldiers should be written. For example, when writing a fierce battle scene and the heroic actions of the soldiers, if it only describes how fierce the enemy's artillery fire is, how fiercely the enemy rushes up, and after a burst of grenades from our soldiers, the enemy is beaten down. Then the enemy charges a second time, a third time, and our soldiers use grenades to beat them down a second and third time, etc., it is very likely to make the reader feel that our soldiers are not like living people, but like grenade-throwing machines. This only describes one layer of the soldier's skin, and does not write about the hero's life and soul. The living people are written to death, and the heroic people are written into paper figures and paper horses. Even the most surprising deeds do not feel very touching. However, if we write about the soldiers' thoughts and feelings, the feeling will be very different. They will feel that the people who made such heroic actions are people of flesh and blood like themselves. Even if the examples are not very prominent, they will still be touching. For example, the matter of being wounded and not leaving the front line is almost the most common thing in the revolutionary ranks, but if you can write about the thoughts and feelings of a wounded soldier when he is wounded but does not leave the front line, it will be touching. The reason is that people's thoughts and feelings are always connected, and as long as you convey the thoughts and feelings, you can connect people who are thousands of miles apart and in completely different situations. In particular, the thoughts and feelings of our soldiers are so noble and beautiful, and they themselves have such a touching power!
　　The experience of this article also tells me that the purpose of an article should be simple and clear. It is indeed not an easy task to explain one meaning thoroughly in a short article. However, when you start writing, you always want to be comprehensive, and want to tell people this and that. As a result, the questions are not raised sharply or clearly, let alone solved in depth. Because no meaning is explained thoroughly, how can it give people a deep impression? When I first wrote this article, I originally wanted to say several meanings, but I didn't do that in the end.
　　As for why it appears in the form of a correspondence? Speaking of this, it involves one of my old problems in the past. I used to like to write poetry, and although I wrote some correspondences during the War of Resistance Against Japan, I didn't value correspondences that much. This time when I came back, I wanted to write something else first, but I always thought: such a great struggle and great soldiers must be written out quickly, if I slowly delve into long and detailed things, and in the end it doesn't work out, how can I be worthy of the soldiers? So, I started writing this correspondence. This is the writing process and a little bit of shallow experience of this article.

### 我怎样写《谁是最可爱的人》

　　我怎样写《谁是最可爱的人》
    编者按：魏巍同志的朝鲜通讯《谁是最可爱的人》是朝鲜前线通讯中写得很好的一篇。本报编辑部于五月间曾邀请魏巍同志谈他创作这篇通讯的经验，并写成本文。我们认为他所说的创作思想和创作方法是正确的，值得新闻工作者和文艺工作者参考。
    我能写出《谁是最可爱的人》，最基本的原因，是我们的战士的英雄气魄、英雄事迹，是这样的伟大，这样的感人。而这一切，把我完全感动了。
    《谁是最可爱的人》这个主题，是我很久以来就在脑子里翻腾着的一个主题。我在部队里时间比较长，对战士有这样一种感情，觉得我们的战士是最可爱的人。每当我和他们坐在一起，不知道为什么，我就觉得满心眼儿的高兴。
    这次我到朝鲜去，在志愿军里，使这种感情更加深了一层。我更加觉得战士们的可爱。我看到他们在朝鲜战争中，虽然面临的任务是这样艰巨，作战环境是这样艰苦，但我们战士的英雄性，比起我过去在抗日战争和解放战争中所看到的，却有着更高的发展。特别这种英勇的普遍性，更是空前的。譬如，我在某步兵团曾了解到一个令人惊讶的数目字，这个团，至第三次战役结束止，伤员自己请求留队的比送到医院休养的数目字还要大。这恐怕在世界战争的历史上，也是一种奇迹！这一事实更加督促着我，使我有一种更加强烈的愿望来表现《谁是最可爱的人》这一主题。
    现在，回过头来看这篇稿子，使我更明确了这一点：在现实生活中的深入感受，对写作的人是多么重要！你感受得深了，写出来，也就必然有那么一股子劲，人家读了，也就感受得深；你感受得浅，人家从你这儿受到的，也就浅。你根本还没有感动呢，那就用不着说了。这儿，我还要加一句，就是深入的感受，跟深入的采访很有关系。就拿在战士中的采访来说吧，你跟他们谈得深，你对他们了解得深，他们的气质、思想、感情，就会感染你，使你也沉入到他们的情绪中。也就是说，使你感受得更深些。
    我怎样来表现这一主题呢？首先，我希图追求着最本质的东西。在朝鲜，我脑子里经常想着一个问题：我们的战士，为什么那样英勇呢？就硬是不怕死啊！那种高度的英雄气概是从什么地方来的呢？为了找答案，我谈了好多话，开了好多座谈会。我细细跟他们谈，让他们把心里的话谈出来。跟我谈的，有指挥员、战斗英雄、一般的战士、干部、新参军的学生和过去曾经是落后的人。我了解到，他们由于锻炼与认识的不同，虽然有些差异，但是都有着共同的一点，即对于伟大祖国的爱，对朝鲜人民深刻的同情，和在这个基础上的做一个革命英雄的荣誉心。于是，我了解了在党的教育下这种伟大深厚的爱国主义与国际主义的思想感情，就是我们战士英勇无畏的最基本的动力。我想，这不是最本质的东西吗？这就是最本质的东西。我肯定了它。我一定要反映它。我毫不怀疑。一切其它枝节性的，片面性的，偶然性的东西，都不能改变我对这个问题的认识。
    问题的本质找到了，那么，应该怎么样反映这个最本质的东西呢？在朝鲜时，我曾写了一篇《自豪吧，祖国》的通讯，里边写了二十多个我认为最生动的例子。带回来给同志们看了看，感到不好，就没有拿出去发表。因为例子堆得太多了，好像记账，哪一个也说得不清楚，不充分。以后写《谁是最可爱的人》，就只选择了几个例子，在写完后又删掉了两个。事实告诉我：用最能代表一般的典型例子，来说明本质的东西，给人的印象是清楚明白的，也会是突出的。
    写战士怎样才写得生动？我感觉不仅应写战士的英雄行为，还要写出战士英雄行为中的英雄的思想感情。譬如写一个激烈的战斗场面和战士的英雄行为，如果仅仅写敌人炮火多么厉害，敌人如何凶猛地往上冲，经过我们战士的一阵手榴弹，把敌人打下去了。接着敌人又第二次冲锋，第三次冲锋，我们的战士又是第二次、第三次地把他们用手榴弹打下去了，等等，很可能使读者感到我们的战士不像一个活的人，而煞像一个投手榴弹的机器。这就是只写了战士的一层皮，没有写出英雄的生命和灵魂。把活的人写死了，把英雄的人写成了纸人纸马。再出奇惊人的事迹，也觉得不太感动人。可是，如果我们写出了战士的思想感情，那给人的感觉就会大大不同。他们会感到：原来做出这样英勇行为的人，是跟自己一样有血有肉的人。即使例子不太突出，仍然会感人的。比如负伤不下火线的事情，这在革命队伍中，几乎是最平常的了，但如果能把一个伤员负伤却不下火线时的思想感情写出来，是会感动人的。原因是：人民的思想感情总是相通的，你只要传达了思想感情，就可以把相距千万里，所处的情境完全不相同的人们连结在一起。特别是我们的战士的思想感情是如此的崇高而美丽，它本身是具有多么感人的力量！
    这篇东西的经验，又告诉我：一篇东西的目的性，要简单明确。一篇短东西，能把一个意思说透，的确不是一件很容易的事。可是，动起笔来，又总爱面面俱到，想告诉人家这个，又想告诉人家那个。结果呢，问题提得不尖锐，不明确，更别说深入地解决问题。因为哪个意思也没有说透，怎么能给人以深刻的印象呢？我写这篇东西之初，原也想说好几个意思，最后没有那样做。
    至于为什么以通讯的形式出现呢？说到这里，又牵连到过去自己的一个老毛病。我原是个喜爱写诗的，虽然在抗战期间写过些通讯，但对通讯，总不是那么看重。这次回来，又想先写别的，但又老想：这样伟大的斗争和伟大的战士必须要很快写出来呵，如果慢慢在那儿钻长的、刻细的，最后又弄不成，怎么对得起战士呢？这样，就着笔写了这篇通讯。这篇东西的写作经过及一点点浅薄的体会，就是这样。
