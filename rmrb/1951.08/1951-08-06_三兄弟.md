　　Three Brothers
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhao Pu
    In a certain company of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, there are three blood brothers fighting together for justice and peace. The eldest of these three brothers is named Ding Quanren, a member of the Communist Party of China, serving as an ammunition handler in the machine gun squad. The second brother is named Ding Quanyi, and the third is Ding Quanwu. Both are members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and serve as soldiers in the infantry squad.
    The three brothers are from a small county town in Northeast China, and lost their parents when they were young. During the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, they suffered greatly. The eldest was forced to work as a laborer by the Japanese invaders, the second herded cattle for landlords, and the third begged for food. They wandered everywhere, homeless. It wasn't until the liberation of Northeast China and the implementation of land reform that the eldest brother married and they established a peaceful home. Last winter, when the American invading army's artillery fire approached the Yalu River, Ding Quanyi was working in an oil mill. Thinking about his past miserable life and looking at his present happy circumstances, he thought, if the enemy comes, everything will be over. He decided to sign up for the Volunteer Army to resist America, aid Korea, protect the home, and defend the country. So he went home, intending to tell his family about this decision. But as soon as he entered the house, he saw his older brother and younger brother also discussing joining the Volunteer Army. Neighbors hoped that the Ding family could keep one man at home to take care of things, and that all three brothers didn't need to go. This led to a small dispute. Quanyi said, "Quanwu is too young, and the eldest brother can stay at home to take care of my sister-in-law and nephew. I'll go alone." Quanren said, "You two are too young, I'll go alone. I'm a Communist Party member, I should be at the forefront." Quanwu retorted, "American devils kill people regardless of age, if you want to set an example, we must learn from Party members!" Just as the three brothers were arguing, the sister-in-law spoke up. She said to her husband, "I'll take care of the child, you don't have to worry. The three of you should go together. With one more person, there's one more bit of strength. The sooner you defeat the American devils, the sooner we can return to peaceful days." In the end, it was decided that all three would sign up for the Volunteer Army.
    After arriving in Korea, these three brothers were very brave and tenacious in battle. During the second stage of the Fifth Campaign, Ding Quanren maintained his exemplary role as a Communist Party member in the three-day and three-night battle at Nanheye Mountain, south of Xiepingchuan. When others were resting, he was still reinforcing fortifications. When food supplies were short, he encouraged his comrades to endure everything for the sake of eliminating the enemy and for the happiness of the people of the motherland. Encouraged by Ding Quanren, his two younger brothers and comrades always maintained a strong fighting spirit. In the fierce fighting, Ding Quanren killed many enemies. Later, he himself was wounded. As he left the front line, he repeatedly urged his two younger brothers to strive for meritorious service for the people in battle, and he expressed that he would return to kill the enemy again once he recovered from his injuries. The second brother, Ding Quanyi, always kept his older brother's words in mind, and he was determined to kill more enemies to avenge his brother. In one battle, he personally killed four enemies. The third brother, Ding Quanwu, was assigned as a communications soldier in this battle. He completed arduous communication tasks every time under the enemy's fire, and also killed several enemies with hand grenades.

　　三兄弟
    新华社记者  赵普
    在中国人民志愿军某部的一个排里，有亲兄弟三个人在为正义与和平而一起战斗着。这三兄弟里面，老大叫丁全任，是中国共产党的党员，在机枪班当弹药手；老二叫丁全义，老三叫丁全武，他俩都是中国新民主主义青年团的团员，都在步兵班当战士。
    三兄弟是东北一个小县城里的人，从小就失去了双亲。在日寇和国民党反动派统治时期，他们受尽了折磨。老大曾被日寇拉去当劳工，老二给地主放过牛，老三讨过饭。他们到处流浪，无家可归。直到东北解放，实行土地改革以后，老大娶了妻子，他们才建立起一个安乐的家庭。去年冬天，当美国侵略军的炮火逼近鸭绿江的时候，丁全义正在一家油坊里做工。他想想过去的悲惨生活，看看现在的美满光景，心想，如果敌人来了，那就一切都完蛋了。他下决心报名参加志愿军，去抗美援朝保家卫国。他就回家去，打算把这个决心告诉家里人。可是他一进家门，就看见哥哥和弟弟也正在讨论着参加志愿军的事。邻居们都希望丁家能留个男人在家里照看，不必兄弟三个一起去。这时就发生了个小小的争论。全义说：“全武年龄太小，大哥可以留在家中照顾嫂子和侄儿，我一个人去好了。”全任说：“你们两个年龄太小，还是我一个人去。我是共产党员，应该走在前头。”全武抢着说：“美国鬼子杀人是不论大小的，你要起模范作用，我们也要向党员学习！”三兄弟正争执不下的时候，大嫂子开了口，她对丈夫说：“孩子由我照顾，你不用操心，三个人一块去好了。多一个人，多一分力量，早一点把美国鬼子打败了，好回来过太平日子。”最后就这样决定了，三个人一齐报名参加志愿军。
    这三兄弟到了朝鲜以后，在战斗中都很英勇顽强。丁全任在第五次战役的第二阶段里，在偕平川以南的南禾也山的三昼夜战斗中，一直保持共产党员的模范作用。别人休息时，他还在加修工事。当粮食供应不上的时候，他便鼓励战友们为了消灭敌人，为了祖国人民的幸福，忍受一切。在丁全任的鼓励下，他的两个弟弟和战友们始终保持着坚强的战斗意志。在激烈的战斗中，丁全任打死了许多敌人。后来他自己负伤了。当他离开火线时，他还再三地叮嘱两个弟弟一定要在战斗中争取为人民立功，他并表示伤好以后就回来再杀敌人。老二丁全义时时刻刻都记着哥哥的话，他决心要多杀敌人，为哥哥报仇。在一次战斗里，他曾亲手打死四个敌人。老三丁全武在这次战斗中调作通讯员，在敌人的火网下他每一次都完成了艰巨的通讯任务，并且用手榴弹炸死了好几个敌人。
