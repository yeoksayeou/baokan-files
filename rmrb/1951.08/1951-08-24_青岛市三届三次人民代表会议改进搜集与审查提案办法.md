　　Qingdao City Third Session of the Third People's Congress Improves Methods for Collecting and Reviewing Proposals
    The Third Session of the Third People's Congress of Qingdao (held on June 16th) valued people's proposals and improved the methods for collecting and reviewing them. They criticized the past formalistic tendencies of emphasizing the format of proposals and neglecting the content, abolished the past methods stipulated in the "Proposal Guidelines" such as "representatives' proposals must be discussed by the representative group and submitted in the name of the representative delegation," and determined that proposals should not be restricted by formalities. In order to fully promote the spirit of democracy, representatives were required to go deep into the masses to collect opinions. As a result, this meeting received a total of 362 proposals, a fourteen-fold increase compared to the previous meeting. The quality of the proposals has also significantly improved, with most being able to raise issues based on policies and in conjunction with actual needs, so most are reasonable and feasible.
    The sorting of proposals was carried out under the principle of "maintaining the spirit of the original proposal," combining proposals with repetitive subjects and categorizing and transcribing proposals with multiple issues. Through sorting, the proposals were made clear, methodical, and complete, which greatly facilitated the review and future implementation.
    The review of proposals was based on the premise of "according to the city's situation this year and the possibilities of financial strength, and striving to meet the people's requirements as much as possible," and four principles were established: 1. Those that are needed and can be done must be done; 2. Those that are needed but can only be partially implemented due to objective conditions should be gradually realized; 3. Those that are needed but the conditions are not yet met or involve a wide range of issues and require investigation and research or instructions from higher authorities should be submitted to the government for research and consideration; 4. Those that do not meet the above principles should be explained. According to the results of the review based on these principles, 70 percent of the proposals met the first and second principles, and only 17 required explanation. When specifically reviewing proposals, they were divided into five groups according to their nature to conduct separate reviews, and the heads of relevant business departments were invited to participate to provide information. Each group carefully analyzed and studied the content of the proposals and drafted review opinions. For issues involving a wide range of issues, decisions were made after repeated discussions and considerations. For some complex proposals, even after soliciting opinions, discussions, and research, it was still not possible to understand the actual situation, so on-the-spot investigations were conducted. For example, in dealing with the proposal "requesting Shandong University to open Yin Island Road," the Municipal Construction Group Committee, representatives of Shandong University, the Director of the Municipal Construction Bureau, and the Deputy Mayor went to Shandong University for investigation. Based on the results of the investigation, it was decided to hand it over to Shandong University for research and handling, based on the principle of valuing the opinions of the masses and taking into account the difficulties of Shandong University.
    After the group review was completed, in order to make the review opinions of the proposals more practical, a proposal group symposium was specially convened. Representatives could freely register to participate in discussions in each group. After discussion, revision, and supplementation at the symposium, the review opinions became more accurate, and the depth of the review work was also checked. For example, in the issue of universally installing public water faucets, it was found in the symposium discussion that the review opinions failed to take into account the business difficulties, and were immediately revised. In addition, explaining the government's policies on various issues through the symposium also improved the ideological understanding of the representatives.

　　青岛市三届三次人民代表会议改进搜集与审查提案办法
    青岛市第三届第三次各界人民代表会议（六月十六日召开），重视人民提案，改进了搜集与审查提案的办法。他们批判了过去重视提案格式，忽视提案内容的形式主义偏向，废除了过去“提案须知”中所规定的“代表提案须通过代表组讨论并以代表团名义提出”等办法，确定提案不受形式的拘束。为充分发扬民主精神，并要求代表深入群众搜集意见。因此，这次会议共收到提案三百六十二件，较上次会议的提案增加了十四倍。提案质量也有显著提高，多能根据政策，结合实际需要提出问题，故大部合理可办。
    提案的整理，是在“保持原案精神”的原则下，把案由重复的提案，加以合并；一案多事的，加以分类抄开。通过整理，就使提案达到明确、条理、完整的要求，并对审查和将来的执行都有很大方便。
    审查提案，在“根据本年市政情况及财政力量的可能，并尽量满足人民要求”的前提下，确定了四项原则，即：一、凡是需要而又能办到的肯定必办；二、凡是需要但因限于客观条件，目前只能举办一部分者，争取逐步实现；三、凡是需要而条件尚不具备或牵涉问题较广，须调查研究或请示上级才能决定者，交政府研究考虑；四、不合上述原则者，解释说明之。根据这个原则审查的结果，百分之七十的提案符合一、二两个原则，需要解释说明的只十七件。在具体审查提案时，按照提案的性质分为五个组，分头进行审查，并邀请有关业务部门的负责人参加，以供给情况。各组认真详细地分析研究提案内容，拟具审查意见。对牵涉较广的问题，经反复讨论、考虑后，才作决定。有的情况复杂的提案，虽经征询意见、讨论、研究，仍不能了解实际情况，便作实地调查。如在处理“要求山东大学开放阴岛路”提案时，市政建设组委员会与山东大学代表、市建设局长及副市长至山东大学调查，根据调查结果，决定在重视群众意见、并顾及山东大学困难的原则下，交由山东大学研究办理。
    小组审查完毕，为使提案的审查意见更切合实际，特别召开了提案分组座谈会。各代表可以自由报名参加各组讨论。经过座谈会的讨论、修正、补充，审查意见则更趋正确，同时也检查了审查工作的深入程度。如普设自来水栓问题，在座谈讨论中发现审查意见未能照顾到业务上的困难，当即予以修正。此外，通过座谈会说明政府对各种问题的政策，也提高了代表们的思想认识。
