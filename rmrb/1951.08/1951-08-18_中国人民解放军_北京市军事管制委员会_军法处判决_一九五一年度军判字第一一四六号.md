            Facts and Reasons

            I. Defendant Li Andong

    Defendant Li Andong has been engaged in activities endangering the Chinese people since he came to China in 1919. From 1923 to 1924, he opened the Italian-Asian Company (The Asiatic Import and Export Co.) in Tianjin, and repeatedly peddled munitions to the Northern Warlords Cao Kun, Qi Xieyuan, etc., for their internal wars that harmed the Chinese people. In 1926, he organized a fascist party branch in Beijing and served as its branch secretary. In 1934, he was dispatched by the Italian fascist government as the secretary-general of the "Italian Air Force Guidance Group" to China, assisting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in purchasing large quantities of aircraft from Italy, and helping to build airports and train air forces that slaughtered the Chinese people in Nanchang and Luoyang. After the July 7th Incident, he and Hidakami Tomiaki, a senior special agent of the "North China Area Army Headquarters Reporting Department" of Japan, collected intelligence in various regions of North China and supplied it to the Japanese invading army in order to attack our North China anti-Japanese base areas.

    In March 1948, this defendant accepted the espionage mission given by Colonel David Dean Barrett, the military attache of the former US Embassy in China in Peiping, and recruited Japanese special agent Yamaguchi Ryuichi as an informant. He also directed Martina, Wei Zhi, Zhe Li, Gansner, Ma Xinqing, etc., who served as spies for the US government, to collect intelligence on our liberated areas in terms of military, political, and economic aspects, which were reported by the defendant to Barrett.

    After the liberation of Beijing, under Barrett's instructions, this defendant continued to engage in espionage activities under the guise of being the Beijing agent of James Walter and Sons Co. of Tianjin. This defendant also instructed Yamaguchi Ryuichi to probe the resumes, addresses, telephone numbers, and car numbers of the leaders of our Central People's Government, representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and persons in charge of the Chinese Communist Party, various democratic parties, and people's organizations, and made them into cards for the purpose of sabotage activities. He also collected intelligence on the political, military, and economic aspects of our Central People's Government, which were conveyed by the defendant to Barrett and other American spy agencies.

    In 1950, this defendant and Yamaguchi Ryuichi conspired to use the mortars, pistols, grenades, and ammunition prepared in advance to carry out a riot during the grand celebration of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and to shell the Tiananmen reviewing stand, plotting to assassinate our head of state and other leaders of the Central People's Government attending the conference. This riot plan was detected by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau in advance. A 60mm mortar, a pistol, 235 rounds of pistol and rifle bullets, a letter of employment from the Nanchang Air Defense Exercise Headquarters of the Kuomintang, two "identity certificates" issued by the "North China Area Army Headquarters Reporting Department" of Japan, and 525 pieces of intelligence supplied by Li Andong to Barrett, correspondence between Li Andong and Barrett, Yamaguchi Ryuichi, and others related to espionage activities were seized at his residence.

    Defendant Li Andong has confessed to the above-mentioned crimes, and there is evidence of the military weapons used in his crimes and Yamaguchi Ryuichi's confession. In accordance with Articles 2, 6(1), 7(1, 4), and 20 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries, the death penalty is imposed.

            II. Defendant Yamaguchi Ryuichi

    Defendant Yamaguchi Ryuichi came to Qingdao, China in 1938 and successively held positions such as section chief of the Japanese puppet "North China Aviation Association" and the Japanese puppet "North China Aviation Industry Federation." In 1944, he came to Beijing and served as the "Director of the Beijing Office of the North China Aviation Industry Federation" of the Japanese puppet regime, specializing in collecting intelligence on ships along the coast of North China and the activities of the Chinese people's anti-Japanese guerrillas, and supplying it to the Japanese Navy Ministry.

    In January 1946, this defendant joined the US Strategic Intelligence Agency (Office of Strategic Service) in Beijing as a spy for the US government. In March of the same year, he joined the Kuomintang International Intelligence Agency, collecting intelligence on the Chinese Communist Party and the liberated areas and supplying it to the US Strategic Intelligence Agency. Since March 1948, after this defendant established an espionage relationship with Li Andong, in addition to continuing to supply intelligence directly to the American spy agency, he also supplied the same intelligence to Li Andong. The main content of his intelligence was the military, political, and economic situation of our liberated areas.

    In November 1948, the US government spy agency ordered this defendant to lie dormant after the liberation of Beijing and continue to engage in espionage activities, and issued activity funds. This defendant went into hiding in the French Bookstore opened by Wei Zhi in Taikichang, Dongjiaomin Lane, using the name of "Chinese Department Book Catalog Editor" as a cover, and collected intelligence with Wei Zhi.

    After the liberation of Beijing, this defendant continued to collect intelligence for Li Andong. In the autumn of 1949, he also directly established an espionage relationship with Colonel Barrett, the military attache of the former US Embassy in China in Peiping. According to the defendant's own confession, Barrett attached great importance to his intelligence, so in late December of the same year, he reported his resume and activities to the US occupation army headquarters in Tokyo and increased his monthly salary to US$150. Since then, the defendant's activities have become even more rampant, and he has made every effort to collect strategic intelligence on our Northeast and North China and report it to the US occupation army headquarters in Tokyo.

    In 1950, this defendant began to conspire with Li Andong to prepare for an armed rebellion, attempting to shell Tiananmen Square on October 1, and reported his intention to conspire to rebel to the US occupation army headquarters in Tokyo. From May to July of the same year, the defendant secretly measured the situation of Tiananmen Square, drew shooting maps, and pointed the arrowed arcs on the map to the chairman's position on the Tiananmen Square reviewing stand, and sent the map with instructions to the US occupation army headquarters in Tokyo on September 16. The defendant also secretly agreed with Li Andong to implement this plan as scheduled. The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau uncovered the plan in advance, and the defendant's draft of the Tiananmen Square shooting map, 12 letters of appointment from the puppet North China Political Affairs Committee, 48 intelligence drafts, 210 resume cards of leaders of the Central People's Government and representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and intelligence materials, spy credentials, and correspondence related to espionage activities with Li Andong A total of 1,093 pieces were seized at his residence.

    Defendant Yamaguchi Ryuichi has confessed to the above-mentioned crimes, and there is evidence of his drawn Tiananmen shooting map and Li Andong's confession. In accordance with Articles 2, 6(1), 7(1, 4), and 20 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries, the death penalty is imposed.

            III. Defendant Martina

    Defendant Martina was sent to China by the "Roman Curia" in 1925 and successively served as the bishop of the Yixian Diocese of the Catholic Church in Hebei Province and the "Beijing Representative" of Riberi, the former "Apostolic Internuncio to China." Over the years, he has been engaged in espionage activities under the guise of preaching.

    As early as during the Japanese invasion of China, this defendant collected our anti-Japanese military intelligence in Yixian, Hebei, and supplied it to the Japanese invading army, and sent a map of the Eighth Route Army's movements, marked in red, to the Japanese army. In 1939, the defendant also helped the Yixian traitor organization "Maintenance Association" to assist the Japanese invaders in enslaving the Chinese people. From 1940 to 1941, the defendant repeatedly greeted the Japanese army to station in his church as a base for the Japanese army to attack our anti-Japanese troops.

    In April 1947, when the Kuomintang bandit army Qiu Xingxiang Division was stationed in Yixian, the defendant colluded with them to organize the special agent armed "plainclothes team." The defendant ordered Italian priest Marco Blasutig to recruit bandits in Lianggezhuang area near Yixian to serve as "plainclothes team members" to probe the military situation in the liberated areas near Yixian. In May 1947, his "plainclothes team" arrested five members of the Eighth Route Army five or six miles northeast of Yixian and handed them over to the Kuomintang army, and their whereabouts have been unknown since. The defendant also frequently dispatched priests to collect military intelligence in the liberated areas under the guise of preaching.

    In June 1947, on the eve of the liberation of Yixian, the defendant escorted the Kuomintang bandit army to Beijing and served as the "Beijing Representative" of the former "Apostolic Internuncio to China" Riberi. In November of the same year, after being introduced by Li Andong and meeting Colonel Barrett, the military attache of the former US Embassy in China in Peiping, he served as a spy for the US government, was directed by Li Andong, and hid military weapons and intelligence drafts for Li Andong.

    Before and after the liberation of Beiping, the defendant probed for intelligence on our country's military, political, and economic aspects, such as "Economic situation of Changxindian area and its surrounding areas" and "Supplementary intelligence on the Juma River Hydropower Project" and handed it over to Li Andong to report to Barrett. In addition, he also provided Riberi with written intelligence on the "Siping Street Battle" and the situation in Fushun, Chahar, Xuanhua, Jiamusi, and other places. The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau detected and confirmed the defendant's espionage activities through Li Andong, and seized six intelligence drafts, mortar shells, rifle bullets, pistol bullets, etc. provided for Li Andong and others to conspire to rebel, 259 rounds, 8 grenades, and 273 mortar shell warheads and primers, weapon parts, etc. at his residence.

After the liberation of Beijing, this defendant used his business as a cover to collect intelligence on our country's economy, culture, and other aspects and supply it to Li Andong. Since 1948, he has harbored Yamaguchi Ryuichi, a US government special agent who conspired to rebel, and provided him with intelligence. After Colonel Barrett, the military attache of the former US Embassy in China in Peiping, withdrew in April 1950, the defendant continued to collect intelligence and send it to the US Consulate in Hong Kong for forwarding to Barrett.

    Defendant Wei Zhi has pleaded guilty to the above-mentioned crimes, and there is evidence of the intelligence drafts seized at his residence and Yamaguchi Ryuichi's confession.
