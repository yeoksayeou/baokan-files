Editor's Note: The Second First All-Circles People's Representative Conference of Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress. The county fully developed the people's democracy, elected representatives, and used democratic consultation to elect the county head and government committee members. This experience is very good. In terms of the meeting's content, it was closely integrated with the current political situation to raise mass awareness. Therefore, it powerfully promoted the central tasks of resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and production and construction throughout the county. At the same time, it also advanced the county's democratic political power construction work a big step forward. This experience of completing central tasks while strengthening political power construction is worthy of attention in various places. Experience has proven that the bias of separating the deployment of central tasks from the work of political power construction is wrong.

The All-Circles People's Representative Conference of Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, was established in October 1949. By the end of last year, it had held a total of seven meetings. In April of this year, the second first meeting was convened, exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress. At this meeting, the county head, members of the government committee, and chairman and members of the standing committee were elected; resolutions on launching the movement to resist America and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries were discussed and adopted; the government's work report, the 1951 work tasks, and the local financial budget were reviewed. This meeting further developed the county's political power construction, thereby promoting the development of various construction tasks and presenting a new atmosphere in the county's work. The main situations and experiences are as follows:

(1) The focus of pre-meeting preparations lies in fully mobilizing the masses and selecting good representatives. Two months before the meeting, a preparatory committee was formed with the Standing Committee as the center, absorbing various agencies and organizations. After repeated consultations, the number of representatives, the method of production, the content of the meeting, etc., were conveyed and implemented through various systems and meetings (such as party congresses, expanded cadre meetings, women's congresses, district head meetings, etc.). At the same time, propaganda outlines were printed and distributed, combined with the current affairs education of resisting America and aiding Korea. The county and district leaders went deep into the villages, cooperated with the village propagandists and literary propaganda groups, and carried out extensive publicity activities in various forms, clearly explaining the significance and tasks of the meeting to the masses, making it known to every household, enabling the masses to understand the importance of selecting good representatives, and establishing the idea of being the masters of their own affairs. Due to the in-depth ideological mobilization work, the masses attached great importance to the election. For example, after the representatives of Beidui Village were elected, the masses instructed who to elect as the county head and sent people three times to inquire about the election results. Among all the representatives, 75 percent were directly elected, 21 percent were indirectly elected, and the rest were invited. The elected representatives were all carefully selected by the masses. The past phenomena of some substitutions and assignments have now been completely overcome. Therefore, the democratic foundation of this meeting is more extensive than any previous one. The masses felt it was an honor to be a representative, believing that being the masters of their own affairs like today was unprecedented. Some representatives reflected: "Our ancestors have never seen ordinary people elect the county head. This right was won by the Communist Party leading us in struggle!" Out of 243 representatives, except for four who were transferred to study and two who asked for leave due to illness, none were absent, and they were always full of enthusiasm and focused their minds, ensuring the success of the conference.

(2) The central topic of the meeting grasped the current general demands of the masses. The meeting focused on deepening the movement to resist America and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and launch the production movement, and made universal brewing among the masses before the meeting. Among the proposals, 155 were about suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and 86 were about spring plowing production (both accounting for more than one-third of the total number of proposals). The meeting closely combined the urgent demands of the masses with the current political tasks. Therefore, 320,000 people in the county, 220,000 people participated in the peace signature, and 170,000 people participated in the "May 1st" parade and demonstration; at the same time, it strongly promoted the in-depth development of the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries in the county.

(3) Fully deliberate and consult, and promote democracy. The preparations before the meeting, the determination of the number of representatives, the drafting of the meeting report, the determination of the organizational structure of the conference, the election of government committee members and the standing committee, the discussion of proposals, and the formulation of resolutions, etc., all went through repeated deliberation, consultation, and discussion, and were submitted to a vote after a general agreement was reached. Therefore, the meeting proceeded very smoothly, and the problems were resolved quite satisfactorily. For example, when the preparatory committee put forward the list of the presidium, it first determined the principle of production, then three to five people freely deliberated, and then concentrated on consultation. After reaching a consensus, it was submitted to the congress for approval. This kind of perfect democratic method, which is fully deliberated, unanimously consulted, and then passed through the necessary voting forms, is also the basic method of conference leadership.

(4) The election of the government committee and the county head is the matter of greatest concern to the people of the county, and it is also an extremely important link in embodying democratic unity. The election in Jincheng County was carried out in three steps. The first step was to freely combine and deliberate within the group, and then the group concentrated on consultation to initially put forward the candidates. The second step was for the presidium to concentrate on consulting the list of candidates proposed by each group, put forward preliminary opinions on the official candidates according to the number of votes, and then each group deliberated to make the opinions roughly consistent, and then voted after being approved by the congress. Because the united front thought education was fully implemented before the election, so that each representative clarified the nature of our regime and the significance of electing representatives of all strata to participate in the work of the regime, and after full consultation and discussion during the election process, the composition of the newly elected government committee members had a fully wide range of representativeness and strengthened the great unity of the people of the county.

(5) Seriously handle proposals. This time, combined with the election of representatives, 613 proposals were collected, exceeding any previous number, and the content was more practical and reasonable. The method of handling proposals is: Submit measures related to the current construction and problems that the masses generally require to be solved to the conference for discussion and make resolutions. For specific problems with generality, such as requiring the early distribution of mixing agents and the purchase of new agricultural tools, the responsible comrades will answer at the conference. Other general problems are given written answers by category. Before the end of the meeting, the opinions on the handling of all proposals were printed and distributed to the representatives. After the meeting, a meeting of responsible comrades of various departments was convened, emphasizing that they should be dealt with immediately, and the results of the handling should be communicated to the representatives in a timely manner through the Standing Committee. Therefore, the representatives were satisfied and generally reflected: "This time I go back, I will explain it clearly to the masses."

　　山西省晋城县人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的情况和经验
    编者按：山西省晋城县的第二届第一次各界人民代表会议代行了人民代表大会职权。该县充分地发扬了人民的民主，选举代表；运用民主协商方式，选出了县长和政府委员，这一经验是很好的。在会议内容方面，紧密地结合了当前的政治形势，提高群众觉悟，因而，有力地推动了全县的抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动和生产建设等中心工作，同时将全县的民主政权建设工作也向前推进了一大步。这样既能完成中心工作，又能加强政权建设的经验，值得各地重视。经验证明，把布置中心工作和政权建设工作脱节的偏向，是错误的。
    山西省晋城县各界人民代表会议，于一九四九年十月建立，截止去年年底，共开过七次会议。今年四月间召开了二届一次会议，代行了人民代表大会职权。在此次会议上选举了县长、政府委员会委员和常委会主席、委员；讨论通过了开展抗美援朝运动和镇压反革命运动的决议，审查了政府工作报告、一九五一年工作任务和地方财政预算。此次会议，使该县的政权建设得到了进一步的发展，从而推动了各项建设任务的开展，使全县工作上呈现了一种新的气象。其主要情况和经验有以下几点：
    （一）会前准备工作的重点，在于充分发动群众和选好代表。会前的两个月，即以常委会为中心吸收各机关、团体组成筹委会。经过反复协商后，将代表名额、产生办法、会议内容等，通过各系统和各种会议（如党代会、扩干会、妇代会、区长会等）进行传达贯彻。同时印发了宣传提纲，结合抗美援朝的时事教育，由县区主要干部深入到村，配合各村宣传员，文艺宣传组，通过各种形式，开展了广泛的宣传活动，把开会意义和任务向群众交代清楚，做到了家喻户晓，使群众认识了选好代表的重要意义，树立了当家做主人的思想。由于深入地进行了思想发动工作，因此群众对选举非常重视，如北堆村选出代表后，群众嘱咐叫选谁当县长，并三次派人打听选举结果。全部代表中，直接选举的占百分之七十五，间接选举的占百分之二十一，其余是邀请的。选出的代表都是经过群众慎重挑选的，过去某些顶替、指派的现象，现已完全克服。因此，这次会议的民主基础，比已往任何一次都更为广泛。群众感到当代表光荣，认为象今天这样当家做主，是史无前例的，有的代表反映：“祖辈没见过老百姓选县长，这权利是共产党领导咱们斗争来的！”二四三名代表，除四名调走学习、二名因病请假外，无一缺席，且始终情绪饱满，思想集中，保证了大会的成功。
    （二）会议的中心议题，抓住了群众当前的普遍要求。会议以深入抗美援朝、镇压反革命、开展生产运动为中心，会前在群众中做了普遍酝酿。提案中有一五五件是关于镇压反革命的，八十六件关于春耕生产的（两者占提案总数的三分之一以上），会议把群众的迫切要求和当前的政治任务密切地结合起来，所以全县三十二万人，二十二万人参加了和平签名，十七万人参加了“五一”游行示威；同时强有力地推动了该县镇压反革命运动的深入开展。
    （三）充分酝酿协商，发扬民主。会前筹备，代表名额的确定，会议报告的草拟，大会组织机构的确定，政府委员和常委会的选举，提案讨论，以及决议制定等，都经过了反复的酝酿、协商和讨论，大体取得一致后，才付诸表决，因此会议进行的非常顺利，问题解决的相当圆满。例如筹委会在提主席团名单时，首先确定了产生的原则，然后三、五人自由酝酿，再集中协商，取得一致后，始交大会通过。这样经过充分酝酿、协商一致，再经过必要的表决形式，是最完善的民主方式，也是会议领导的基本方式。
    （四）选举政府委员会和县长是全县人民最关心的事，也是体现民主团结极其重要的一环。晋城县选举是分三步进行的，第一步是先在小组内自由结合酝酿，再由小组集中协商，初步将候选人提出。第二步由主席团将各组提的候选名单，集中协商，按票数多少提出正式候选人的初步意见，再由各组酝酿，使意见大体趋于一致后，经大会通过始投票。由于选举前，充分的贯彻了统战思想教育，使每个代表明确了我们政权的性质和选举各阶层代表人物参加政权工作的意义，选举过程中经过了充分的协商和讨论，所以新选的政府委员的组成成份具有充分的广泛的代表性，加强了全县人民的大团结。
    （五）认真处理提案。此次结合选举代表搜集了六一三件提案，数量上超过已往任何一次，且内容多切实合理。处理提案的方法采取：有关当前建设的措施和群众普遍要求解决的问题，提交大会讨论，做成决议。对于带有普遍性的具体问题，如要求早发拌种药剂和购买新式农具，由负责同志在大会上作解答。其他一般问题，分门别类给以书面解答。在会议结束前，将全部提案处理意见印发给代表。会后又召集了各部门负责同志会议，强调应即予处理，并将处理结果及时通过常委会转达给代表。因而代表都感到满意，一般反映：“这次回去，给群众好好交代了”。
