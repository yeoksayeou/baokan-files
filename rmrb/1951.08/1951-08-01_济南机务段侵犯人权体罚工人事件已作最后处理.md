To the Editor:

    The People's Daily published a letter on June 20th criticizing the Jinan Locomotive Depot for human rights violations and corporal punishment of workers. On July 9th, the People's Daily also published our preliminary investigation and handling of this incident. Now, we are reporting the final outcome of this matter as follows:

    The Jinan Locomotive Depot convened a meeting of cadres at the section chief level and above to discuss and decide on appropriate disciplinary actions for those who committed the errors: Yu Yongjun, the depot chief, Lu Xiangfu, the transportation director, and Huang Ruilin, the instructing driver and acting deputy director of transportation, were all dismissed from their positions. Xu Shijun and Jing Jixian, the deputy depot chiefs, were each given a major demerit, and Sun Shouqi, the deputy director of transportation, and Li Ziqing, the deputy director of the personnel section, were each given a minor demerit. In addition to the administrative punishments, the Jinan Railway Sub-bureau's political department convened a meeting of all Party and Youth League members of the Jinan Locomotive Depot, severely criticizing this erroneous incident. Mu Youmin, the director of the Jinan Sub-bureau, and Zhao Jinxian, the vice chairman of the China Railway Trade Union's Jinan District Committee, both convened mass meetings at the Jinan Locomotive Depot, pointing out that this act of human rights violation and corporal punishment of workers was a reflection of bureaucratic-capitalist ruling ideology, and calling on worker comrades to boldly expose and criticize the shortcomings and errors in the work of leading cadres.

    Due to the widespread criticism of this erroneous behavior by readers of various newspapers and the attention and serious handling of this incident by the leaders of the Railway Administration, the personnel of the Jinan Locomotive Depot who committed the errors have gradually and deeply recognized the seriousness of this erroneous behavior. In addition to requesting severe punishment from higher authorities, the depot chief, deputy depot chiefs, and transportation director have apologized to the workers and made self-criticisms at the depot's employee representative meeting, expressing that they must humbly learn from the masses in the future and wholeheartedly rely on the working class to run the people's railway事业.

    After the handling of this incident, the production enthusiasm of the workers at the Jinan Locomotive Depot has increased, and accidents have decreased. In early June, responsibility accidents at the Jinan Locomotive Depot accounted for 50% of the eleven locomotive depots in the entire bureau; however, after handling this incident, no traffic responsibility accidents occurred in the seven days from June 20th to June 26th. The total number of responsibility accidents in June also decreased by four compared to May. The Locomotive Depot's CCP general branch, administration, and trade union have also formulated plans to re-elect the trade union depot committee and the democratic management committee, review and revise the patriotic pact, earnestly carry out the rationalization proposal movement, adjust unreasonable production organization, and revise unreasonable production systems, so as to combine leadership with the masses and ensure the complete fulfillment of the transportation tasks assigned by higher authorities.

    The occurrence of this incident shows that there are still significant shortcomings in our bureau's leadership. First and foremost, the ideological education and policy education on wholeheartedly relying on the working class among cadres is insufficient. This is the main reason for the occurrence of this incident. After the incident occurred, some cadres at the locomotive depot even believed that this was a "good method" for "educating" the masses; this shows to what extent the ideological and policy concepts of relying on the working class are blurred among certain cadres!

    In order to educate cadres, educate the masses, establish the ideology of cadres wholeheartedly relying on the working class, and correct bureaucratic work styles through this serious incident, the Railway Administration has not only publicized the course of this incident and the punishment of the relevant personnel in the bureau's newspaper, but also universally organized learning and conducted ideological self-examinations. It has now been decided to first organize an inspection of the implementation of the Trade Union Law in August, and to check the ideology of wholeheartedly relying on the working class and expose bureaucratic work styles through the inspection of the implementation of the Trade Union Law.

                                                Jinan Railway Administration

    济南机务段侵犯人权体罚工人事件已作最后处理
    编辑同志：
    六月二十日人民日报发表了关于批评济南机务段侵犯人权体罚工人的来信，七月九日的人民日报上又发表了我们对此事件的初步检查与处理情况，现在再将这件事最后处理结果报告如下：
    济南机务段召开了处长以上的干部会议，讨论并决定给予犯错误人员以应得的处分：机务段段长于永浚、运转主任路象孚、指导司机代理运转副主任黄瑞霖均撤销职务，副段长徐世骏、荆继贤各记大过一次，运转副主任孙守齐、人事股副主任李子庆各记小过一次。除行政处分外，济南分局政治处召开了济南机务段的全体党团员会议，严肃地批判了这一错误事件。济南分局长牟友民、中国铁路工会济南区委员会副主席赵进先都先后召开了济南机务段的群众大会，指出这一侵犯人权体罚工人的行为是官僚资本主义统治思想的反映，并号召工人同志大胆揭发与批评领导干部工作中的缺点和错误。
    济南机务段的犯错误人员，由于各报读者纷纷批判这一错误行为与管理局领导同志对这一事件的重视与认真处理，已逐步深入地认识到这一错误行为的严重性，除请求上级严厉处分外，在段的职工代表会上，段长、副段长与运转主任都已向工人道歉，作了检讨，并表示今后一定要虚心向群众学习，全心全意依靠工人阶级办好人民铁路事业。
    经过对这一事件的处理，济南机务段的工人生产情绪提高了，事故减少了。六月上旬济南机务段的责任事故占全局十一个机务段的百分之五十；而处理这事件后，六月二十日到二十六日七天中未出一件行车责任事故。六月份全月的责任事故也比五月减少四件。机务段中共总支、行政、工会也订出计划，准备改选工会段委员会与民主管理委员会，检查与修订爱国公约，认真开展合理化建议运动，调整不合理的生产组织与改订不合理的生产制度，使领导与群众相结合，保证完全完成上级给予的运输任务。
    这一事件的发生，说明我局领导上还存在着很大的缺点，首先是在干部中进行全心全意依靠工人阶级的思想教育和政策教育不够，这是发生这一事件的主要原因。这一事件发生后，机务段有的干部还认为这是“教育”群众的“好办法”；这说明某些干部依靠工人阶级的思想和政策观念模糊到了何等程度！
    管理局为了通过这一严重事件来教育干部，教育群众，确立干部全心全意依靠工人阶级的思想，纠正官僚主义作风，除已将这一事件之经过及对有关人员的处分在局报上公布外，并普遍组织学习，进行思想检查。现已决定在八月份内首先组织一次对工会法执行情况的检查，通过对工会法的执行情况的检查来检查全心全意依靠工人阶级思想，并揭发官僚主义作风。
                                                济南铁路管理局
