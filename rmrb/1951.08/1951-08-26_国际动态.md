　　International Developments
　　The Troubles of Britain's Partner
　　The British government has always relied on the tin, rubber, and wool it cruelly extracts from its colonies as its main source of earning US dollars. The United States, however, adopts the approach of suppressing raw material prices to prevent Britain from earning dollars. For example, as a result of the United States using the method of suspending purchases to drive down prices, the price of wool on the London market on August 15th had fallen by 65% compared to February of this year. According to the Associated Press, quoting a senior official in Washington, any foreign country that wants to open the "US treasury" with "a key" will find that the lock has been changed. This smug senior official in Washington stands in stark contrast to his gloomy British partner.
　　British People's Growing Resentment
　　Since the devaluation of the pound sterling in September 1949, the prices of raw materials and food in Britain have risen by more than 50%, the prices of imported goods have risen by more than 70%, and wholesale prices have risen by 40%. Rising prices have made it difficult for the people to breathe, and the huge burden of military expansion and war preparations that the Labour government is pursuing by following the United States is also heavily weighing on the people's shoulders. Last year, taxes accounted for nearly 50% of workers' wage income. This year will be even worse than last year.
　　Callaghan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, also clearly saw the crisis lurking here and recently kindly told those entrepreneurs who are making huge profits: "Be careful! Because the people are seeing that the big capitalists intend to cut the already meager wages of the workers, they are becoming increasingly resentful."
　　The Backstage Boss of West German Reactionary Newspapers
　　The West German people are increasingly disgusted with the West German reactionary newspapers that spread war hysteria and revanchist sentiments. What West German readers who demand peace, democracy, and unity need is the true voice of the people and real news, not slander and rumors. Therefore, the circulation of the seven hundred reactionary newspapers in West Germany is less than 10,000 copies. The US High Commissioner to West Germany, McCloy, had to provide 15 million marks to these seven hundred reactionary newspapers as "financial assistance" to prop up their dilapidated facade. In this way, although reactionary newspapers can continue to spread rumors with the "assistance" from their American masters, West German readers are even more disgusted with them.

    英国伙计的苦恼
    英国政府一向以在它的殖民地残酷榨取的锡、橡胶和羊毛作为赚取美元的主要来源的。美国则采取压低原料价格的办法，不让英国赚取美元。例如：因为美国用停购杀价办法的结果，八月十五日伦敦市场上羊毛的价格已因此比今年二月下跌了百分之六十五。据美联社引华盛顿一位高级官员的话说，想用“一把钥匙”打开“美国金库”的任何外国，都会发现这把锁已经换了。这位得意洋洋的华盛顿高级官员，正和它的愁眉苦脸的英国伙计成一鲜明对照。
    英国人民越来越愤慨
    自从一九四九年九月英镑贬值迄今，英国的原料与食品价格已上涨百分之五十以上，进口货价格上涨百分之七十以上，批发价格上涨了百分之四十。物价上涨已压得人民透不过气来，而工党政府追随美国扩军备战的巨额费用负担又沉重地压在人民肩上。去年，捐税占去工人工资收入近百分之五十。今年又将甚于去年。
    英国海军部驻议会次官卡拉翰显然也看出了这里潜伏着危机，最近善意地告诉那些获得庞大利润的企业家们说：“当心啊！因为人民看到大资本家打算削减已经低得可怜的工人工资，他们已经越来越愤慨了。”
  西德反动报纸的后台老板
    西德人民愈来愈厌恶那些散布战争歇斯底里和复仇主义情绪的西德反动报纸。要求和平、民主和统一的西德读者，需要的是真正的人民的声音和真实的新闻，而不是诽谤和谣言。因此，西德七百家反动报纸的发行额都不满一万份。美国驻西德的高级专员麦克洛埃不得不以一千五百万马克给这七百家反动报纸作为“财政援助”来支撑残破的门面。这样一来，反动报纸虽从美国主子那里获得“援助”可以继续造谣，西德读者却更厌恶它们了。
