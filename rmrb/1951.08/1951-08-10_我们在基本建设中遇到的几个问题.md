Several Problems We Encountered in Basic Construction
Manager of the Beijing Branch of China Construction Engineering Corporation Liu Jusheng

This year, the Beijing Branch of China Construction Engineering Corporation is undertaking a considerable amount of construction work. In the past six months, we have encountered many problems, some of which have not yet been completely resolved. We are now presenting these problems, hoping that everyone can provide us with criticism and assistance to enable us to better complete our tasks.

(I) Design Aspects

In our design work, the following problems have occurred:

1. Insufficient investigation before design. Some projects did not conduct soil load tests, resulting in the discovery of poor soil conditions after construction began, requiring further testing or changes to the foundation design, which affected the progress of the project. This situation occurred at the construction sites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Women Cadres School, and the Attached Girls' Middle School of the Normal University.

Some projects did not accurately measure the terrain during the site survey, resulting in discrepancies between the building design drawings and the size of the foundation. For example, the ward drawings for the Beijing Third Hospital were eight Chinese inches larger, the drawings for a certain building of the Central Film Bureau were two meters larger, and the drawings for a certain building of the Central Publishing Administration were wrong by two meters. All these errors were discovered after construction began.

2. Calculation errors during design. For example, in the Women Cadres School project, the dimensions and structure of the roof truss were incorrect. After the construction workers discovered the error and corrected it, a large amount of wood and iron parts were used, and the foundation piling project was increased, totaling more than 20 million yuan in value. The concrete lintel construction of the Supreme People's Court and the Attached Girls' Middle School of the Normal University was improper and was also corrected during construction. In the original drawings of a certain building of the Publishing Administration, the thickness of the door and window sashes was only three centimeters. The second time the drawings were sent, they were changed to four or four and a half centimeters, but the on-site construction workers were not informed. By the time the construction workers discovered it themselves, the door and window wood had already been prepared, resulting in losses. This proves that some designers are not only careless in their designs, but also dare not expose their shortcomings after discovering them, and lack the spirit of self-examination.

3. The materials specified in the design are unrealistic. For example, when building houses in Beijing, they must use gravel from Tangshan; using foreign materials when domestic materials are available; brick materials must have square edges and corners; wood must be specified as having no cracks or knots. In fact, a large number of brick materials are collected from various places and transported over long distances, making it impossible for all of them to have square edges and corners; a large number of wood materials are transported from the Northeast and are in short supply, making the requirements too high and detached from reality.

4. Design drawings are not timely. The design drawings for building equipment, such as sanitation, water supply, heating, and electric lights, are mostly not produced in time to coordinate with the construction, resulting in the need to chisel grooves and drill holes in the newly built brick walls or concrete to install the equipment. This not only wastes labor but also damages the solidity and aesthetics of the project. This situation has occurred in the projects of the Beijing Third Hospital, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Ministry of Communications, the Bank of Communications, and the dormitory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The above situations all show that the sense of responsibility of the design staff for the people's cause is not enough. At the same time, the comrades responsible for supervision during construction rarely go to the site for inspection; when they do go, they only take a cursory look and leave, and cannot promptly assist in solving the difficulties on the site.

(II) Material Aspects

This year, the State Council has assigned a large number of construction tasks to state-owned construction departments, requiring a large amount of wood and brick materials. These materials are designated to be supplied by the China Building Materials Company. In the four months from April to the present, it has been proven that the company has not been able to fulfill its task of supplying materials well. The situation is as follows:

1. Wood Materials: Our China Construction Engineering Corporation requested to purchase 6,000 cubic meters of wood from the company. The first batch approved was 3,000 cubic meters. Of these 3,000 cubic meters, about 1,000 cubic meters were raw materials (i.e., unprocessed round logs). This batch of raw materials was all bad. With an average diameter of 30 centimeters, the outer 5 or 6 centimeters thick ring was rotten, and the central part also had many decayed wormholes, making it extremely difficult to use. Some of the logs were even bent, twisted, knotted, and rotten, making them completely unusable. Ordinary sound raw materials can yield 80% of finished material after processing. This batch of bad wood can only produce up to 40%, which means there will be a loss of 60%, amounting to about 600 cubic meters. Other state-owned construction departments have similar situations. We believe that it is correct in principle for the Northeast Timber Management Authority to clear out and use many old stocks of wood first. However, a preliminary sorting should be done at the place of production, and some bent, twisted, rotten, and completely unusable materials should be removed; the barely usable ones should be processed on the spot, the bark removed, and made into square timber before being transported out. This can reduce a lot of waste. The current practice of transporting a lot of waste materials from the Northeast to Beijing without any sorting is a huge waste. This proves that the China Building Materials Company and the cadres managing wood in the Northeast are blindly carrying out their tasks without seriously studying their business, which is an irresponsible performance of the people's cause. We hope that the China Building Materials Company will compile detailed statistics on this loss and conduct a profound review.

2. Brick Materials: According to the needs of the China Construction Engineering Corporation Beijing Branch's task projects, the China Building Materials Company was allowed to allocate 6.9 million four-edge bricks in July, all of which were Beijing bricks. In fact, the company only allocated 3.1 million bricks in July, of which only 2.5 million were Beijing bricks; the remaining 600,000 were bricks produced along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, which were of poor quality and varied in size. Moreover, after being transported to Beijing by the company, they were completely mixed together, causing difficulties in construction. At the same time, the company's storage yard completely mixed the wood and brick materials together, resulting in many brick materials being broken and damaged, causing considerable losses.

(III) Construction Aspects

In the construction process, based on the situation of our China Construction Engineering Corporation Beijing Branch, the following errors also exist:

1. Lack of attention to planning. According to regulations, a construction plan must be made before construction begins, including construction organization, site preparation, project progress, labor, materials, the quantity of funds, and the supply procedure. However, our general construction personnel do not pay enough attention to planning work, emphasizing that they are too busy to make a construction plan; or they make it with an attitude of simply fulfilling the task. As a result, they feel passive and chaotic in their work, and many unnecessary difficulties occur, making it impossible to actively and confidently complete the task. This is the result of our failure to recognize the importance of planning work ideologically. This situation must be corrected urgently.

2. Dealing with work with an irresponsible attitude and old style. Some construction personnel have strong old social bad habits and do not work with a sense of ownership, resulting in errors in their work. For example, in the basement project of a certain place in the Central Film Bureau, the ground concrete was originally designed with two layers of steel bars. The workers who tied the steel bars did not see the drawings clearly and only tied one layer. Yang Rongting, the supervisor responsible for the construction at the time, did not inspect it and only listened to the workers saying that the steel bars were tied, thinking that there would be no mistakes, and then poured the concrete. The next day, the chief engineer discovered the error. But the cement had already solidified and could not be reworked. In order to ensure solidity, another layer of reinforced concrete was added on top, with a total loss of labor and materials of more than 3 million yuan. Another example is that supervisor Jiao Enhong once asked two workers to do the roof cement floor work. He urged the work vigorously without asking about the actual situation. The workers could only roughly apply a layer of cement mortar on the ground, and did not have time to carefully roll and smooth it. In this way, they did the floor of thirteen rooms in one day. The next morning, they saw that the cement floor was uneven, but the cement had already solidified and could not be re-rolled and smoothed. Jiao then asked the workers to use wooden boards to scrape it flat forcefully, and then sprinkle dry cement and water to rush the rolling, making it very rough and requiring a complete rework, resulting in a loss of seventy-two large bags of cement, totaling about 16 million yuan in labor and material costs.

3. Construction workers do not adhere to correct opinions and unconditionally accommodate the clients. Some project clients emphasize the urgent need for housing and urge to rush the work. For example, they say that how many cadres are working in the stairwells or toilets, or sleeping on the floor. Our construction personnel often accommodate this eager desire for success from the clients and try to accelerate the work as much as possible. However, in this situation, the quality of the project is seriously reduced. For example, the Ministry of Health Medical Assistant School project in the Temple of Heaven, and the auditorium and office project of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, in order to rush the work, interior plastering work was forcibly done during the freezing period of winter 1950 and spring 1951. Although efforts were made to protect and keep warm at the time, the effectiveness was limited. After the weather warmed, the plaster ceilings fell one after another. The Medical Assistant School's ceilings were completely reworked, and most of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's houses were also reworked. The auditorium of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, because it was in use, could not be repaired in time, and as a result, the plaster peeling off the ceiling injured people who were in the meeting. As a result, not only was rework and waste caused, but also the goal of early use was not achieved. It is true that haste makes waste. Today, we have realized that the phenomenon of construction personnel excessively accommodating the opinions of the clients, resulting in losses and even injuries, is a manifestation of our lack of responsibility for the people's cause. In the future, we will insist on doing a good job in the project, guarantee the quality, and never again accommodate the unreasonable demands of the clients or anyone else.

4. Poor relationship between administration and the trade union. This year, on-site trade unions have been established at various construction sites, absorbing workers to join the union as members. In some places, the trade union organizations are very good, and can unite the masses, improve work morale, and do a good job in production tasks. But in some places, they are not doing so well, the trade union is separated from the administration, and even forms an opposing phenomenon, which affects production and construction. The main reason is that the ideological understanding of both parties is not clear enough. The administrative side has not recognized the policy of relying on the workers, and only has a simple technical point of view, thinking that technical and administrative management can do a good job of the project, so they are unwilling to actively support the trade union. This is a serious phenomenon of being divorced from the masses. The trade union side does not understand that the task of the trade union is to organize the strength of the working class to ensure the completion of the production plan, and only emphasizes workers' welfare, and even does not participate in administrative meetings, nor does it want the administrative side to participate in trade union meetings. This ideological deviation urgently needs to be corrected.

(IV) Client Aspects

This year, the China Construction Engineering Corporation Beijing Branch has dozens of task and business projects. Most of the clients, or the project responsible cadres of various agencies, have greatly assisted our company, especially in terms of material quality and project deadlines, and can deeply understand the actual situation and existing difficulties of the construction company and do not make harsh demands. Some clients can also enthusiastically put forward suggestions for improvement and take care of the workers' lives and health with great care, which is of great help to our company. This is worthy of special thanks. However, there are also individual clients who only care about completing their own tasks and do not understand the difficulties of the construction company. Before signing the contract, they ask to start construction; after construction starts, they urge for the house, or demand too ideal of the quality of the work and materials. Therefore, it causes many unnecessary difficulties in construction, which is also not a very correct understanding.

Based on the above facts, it shows that in today's basic construction, there are still some deviations and difficulties, but these can be gradually overcome. It is hoped that the responsible comrades and employees at all levels in the construction work can clearly recognize this ideologically, implement the spirit of serving the people, absorb experiences and lessons, and fully guarantee the completion of the task. And thereby improve the level of our basic construction work.

　　我们在基本建设中遇到的几个问题
    中国建筑企业公司北京市分公司经理  刘聚生
    中国建筑企业公司北京分公司，本年担负相当巨大的工程建设任务。在半年来的工作中，我们曾遇到了许多问题，有的至今尚未完全解决。现在我们把这些问题提出，希望大家能针对这些问题给我们以批评、帮助，使我们能更好地完成任务。
    （一）设计方面
    我们的设计工作中，发生了以下各种问题：
    １、设计前考查不够。有的未作土壤荷重试验，以致开工后发现土壤不良，需要再作试验，或变更基础设计，影响工程进行。在中央人民政府外交部、青年团中央委员会、妇女干部学校、师范大学附属女子中学等工地都有这种情形。
    有的在测量现场时，未将地形量准，以致房屋设计图样和地基大小不一，如北京市第三医院病房图样大了八公寸，中央电影局某建筑物图样大了二公尺，中央人民政府出版总署某建筑物图错了二公尺，都是开工以后才发现错误的。
    ２、设计时计算错误。如妇女干部学校工程，屋架尺寸结构不对，经施工人发现后加以改正，但已多用了大量木料铁件，又增加基础打桩工程，共计值二千多万元。最高人民法院、师范大学附属女子中学洋灰过梁做法不妥当，亦在施工时改正。出版总署某建筑物设计原来图样上门窗扇的厚度只有三公分，第二次又送来图样却改为四公分或四公分半，但并未告知现场施工人。等施工人自己发现时，门窗木料已配制好了，以致造成损失。这证明有些设计人员不单是设计时粗枝大叶，而且在发现缺点以后，还不敢暴露，没有自我检讨的精神。
    ３、设计时指定材料不切实际。比如在北京修房子却一定要用唐山的石子；有本国材料不用，而偏要用外国的材料；砖料一定要棱角方正；木料指定要无裂纹无节疤。事实上大批砖料由各地凑集，经过长途运输，决不可能全部棱角方正；大批木料由东北运来，而且供不应求，要求太高，是脱离实际的。
    ４、设计图样不及时。建筑物附带设备的如卫生、水道、暖气、电灯等的设计图样，多半没有配合施工及时制出，以致要在刚修好的砖墙或混凝土上凿沟穿洞，来装置设备。这样不但浪费人工，更损坏了工程的坚固和美观。这种情形在北京市第三医院、青年团中央委员会、交通部、交通银行、中国科学院宿舍等处工程上都发生过。
    以上各种情况，都说明设计人员对人民事业的责任心还不够。同时，施工中负责监造的同志，很少去现场检查；去了也是走马观花，看看就走，不能及时协助解决现场的困难问题。
            （二）材料方面
    今年政务院分配给国营各建筑部门的工程任务，需用大批的木材及砖料。这些材料指定由中国建筑器材公司负责供应。自本年四月到现在四个月中，事实上证明该公司并没有能很好地担任起供应材料的任务。情况如下：
    １、木材方面：我们中国建筑企业公司向该公司请购了六千立方公尺木料。第一次先批给了三千立方公尺。这三千立方公尺中，有约一千多立方公尺是原料（即未经加工的圆木）。这批原料都是坏的，平均直径按三十公分计，外层五、六公分厚的一圈朽烂不堪，中心部分也有许多腐蛀虫孔，极难应用。有的原木甚至弯曲扭转，瘤疖腐朽，根本无法使用。普通完好的原料，经过加工制材，可得到百分之八十的成材。这一批坏木料，顶多可以制出百分之四十，就是说要有百分之六十的损失，约合六百立方公尺。其他国营建筑部门也有类此情形。我们认为东北木材管理机关要把许多旧存木材尽先出清使用，在原则上是正确的。但是应当在产地先经过一番整理工作，把一些弯扭腐坏根本无用的剔除；勉强可用的就地加工，去掉表皮，制成方材再行运出，这样可以减少很多浪费。像现在这样不加整理地把很多废料由东北运来北京，是极大的浪费。这证明中国建筑器材公司和东北管理木材的干部是盲目地执行任务，而没有认真钻研业务，这是对人民事业不负责任的表现。希望中国建筑器材公司把这一项损失数字详细统计一下，作一个深刻的检讨。
    ２、砖料方面：根据中国建筑企业公司北京分公司任务工程的需要，中国建筑器材公司允许在七月份拨给四丁砖六百九十万块，全是北京砖。实际该公司在七月份只给拨了三百一十万块砖，其中只有二百五十万块是北京砖；其余六十万是京汉铁路沿线出产的砖，质量低劣，尺寸大小不一，并且经该公司运到北京后即完全混合一起，造成施工上的困难。同时该公司的存料场将木材与砖料完全混合堆放一起，以致许多砖料被摔裂打断，有相当大的损失。
            （三）施工方面
    在施工过程中，就我们中国建筑企业公司北京分公司的情况说，也存在下列的错误：
    １、不重视计划。按照规定制度，在施工开始前，一定要作施工计划，其中包括施工组织、现场准备、工程进度、人工、材料、用款的数量及供应程序等。但我们一般的施工人员没有很好地重视计划工作，强调工作忙，而不作施工计划；或者以应付交差的态度来作。于是在工作中更处处感到被动、忙乱，发生了许多不应有的困难，不能够主动地有把握地完成任务。这是我们从思想上没有认识到计划工作的重要性的结果。这种情况亟应纠正。
    ２、以不负责的态度与旧作风来处理工作。有的施工人员存在着浓厚的旧社会恶习，不是以主人翁态度做工作，以致工作中造成错误。例如中央电影局某处地下室工程，地面混凝土照原设计是两层钢筋、扎钢筋工人未看清图样只扎了一层。当时负责施工的监工员杨荣廷未加检验，只听工人说钢筋扎完了，以为不会有错，即行打混凝土。第二天经主管工程师发现才知道错误。但洋灰已经凝固，无法返工。为了保固，只好在上面又加了一层钢筋混凝土，合计损失工料约三百多万元。又如监工员焦恩鸿有一次叫两个工人作屋面洋灰地面工作。他不问实际情况极力催赶工作，工人们只能在地面上粗糙地抹了一层洋灰沙浆，来不及仔细轧光抹平，就这样一天作了十三间屋子的地面。第二天早晨看见洋灰地凸凹不平，但洋灰已经凝固，无法再行抹轧。焦即叫工人拿木板用力刮平、再洒上干洋灰及水来赶轧，弄的非常粗糙，必须全部返工，计损失了七十二大袋洋灰，合计工料款约一千六百万元。
    ３、施工者不坚持正确意见，无原则地迁就委托者。有的工程委托者强调急用房屋，而极力催促赶工，譬如说有多少干部在楼梯间或厕所间办公，在地板上睡觉。我们施工人员常常迁就委托者这种急欲求成的要求，而尽力加速赶工。但在这种情形下，就严重地降低了工程质量。例如天坛内卫生部医助学校工程，及重工业部的礼堂办公室工程，为了赶工在一九五○年冬季及一九五一年春的冰冻期间强做室内抹灰工作。当时虽也设法防护保暖，但效力有限。在天暖以后，灰顶即纷纷坠落，医助学校顶棚全部返工，重工业部房屋也大部返工。重工业部的礼堂，因正在使用，未能及时修理，结果顶棚灰皮脱落，把正在开会的人打伤。结果不但造成返工浪费，也未能达到早用的目的，真是欲速则不达。今天我们已经认识到：施工人员这种过分迁就委托者的意见，以致造成损失甚至伤人事故的现象，是我们对人民事业不够负责的表现。今后我们将坚持做好工程，保证质量，决不再迁就委托者或任何人的不合理的要求。
    ４、行政与工会关系不好。在本年各施工现场都成立了现场工会，吸收工人参加工会为会员，有的地方工会组织很好，能团结群众、提高工作情绪、作好生产任务，但有些地方则搞的不太好，工会与行政脱节，甚至形成对立现象，反而影响生产建设。主要的原因，是双方思想认识都不够明确，行政方面没有认清依靠工人的方针，只是单纯技术观点，以为有技术同行政管理即可做好工程，于是不肯积极的支持工会，这是严重的脱离群众现象。工会方面没有了解工会的任务是组织工人阶级力量保证生产计划的完成，而单独强调工人福利，甚至不参加行政会议，也不希望行政方面参加工会会议，这种思想偏差亟待纠正。
            （四）委托者方面
    本年内中国建筑企业公司北京分公司的任务与业务工程有数十处，委托者方面，或是各机关的工程负责干部，绝大多数对我公司协助很大，特别在材料品质及工程期限方面，能深刻了解建筑公司实际情况与存在困难，不作苛刻的要求。有些委托者还能热诚提出改善意见，并亲切照顾工人的生活健康，对我公司有极大的帮助。这是值得特别感谢的，但另外也有个别的委托者，只顾完成本位任务，不谅解建筑公司的困难。在未签订合同以前，即要求开工；开工以后，又催着要房子，或者对工料之质量要求过于理想。因而给施工上造成许多不必有的困难，也是不太正确的认识。
    根据以上的事实，说明在今日的基本建设中，还存在着一些偏差与困难，但是这都是可以逐步克服的。希望在建设工作中的各级负责同志和职工能从思想上明确认识、贯彻为人民服务的精神，吸收经验教训，全力保证完成任务。并由此把我们基本建设的工作水平提高一步。
