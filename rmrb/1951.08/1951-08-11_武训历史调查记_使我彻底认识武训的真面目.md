    "The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" Made Me Thoroughly Understand Wu Xun's True Colors
    Editor:
    I am a Communist Party member and demobilized soldier of the People's Liberation Army with little historical knowledge and a low level of Marxist-Leninist thought. When Sun Yu's "The Life of Wu Xun" was shown at the Beijing Youth Palace, I went to see it, and at the time I was moved to tears by Wu Xun's deeds of promoting education. I was deceived by the film's revolutionary disguise.
    Afterward, I often paid attention to articles in the newspaper criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun," and gradually realized that Wu Xun was a lackey and an enemy of the people. Recently, I read "The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," and my understanding of Wu Xun's true colors became clearer and more thorough. I suggest that the film and drama circles, based on this investigation, remake a new film with Song Jingshi, the leader of the peasant revolution at the time, as the protagonist, and write a stage play to clarify the harmful effects of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" spread among the masses.

### “武训历史调查记”使我彻底认识武训的真面目

    “武训历史调查记”使我彻底认识武训的真面目编辑同志：
    我是一个历史知识很少、马克思列宁主义思想水平不高的共产党员、复员的解放军。当孙瑜的“武训传”在北京青年宫上映的时候，我曾去看过，当时我为武训的兴学事迹感动得流过眼泪。我被这部影片的革命的伪装所迷惑。
    以后，我经常注意报纸上批判“武训传”的文章，逐渐认识到武训是一个奴才，是一个人民的敌人。最近我又读到“武训历史调查记”，对武训的真面目就认识得更清楚、更加彻底了。我建议电影界、戏剧界根据这个调查记，以当时农民革命领袖宋景诗为主角，重拍一部新的电影，编一个舞台剧，来澄清电影“武训传”在群众中散布的有害影响。
