    Tianjin Municipal Committee Decides to Strengthen the Party Life Column of Tianjin Daily
    On August 15th, Tianjin Daily published the instruction from the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on strengthening the "Party Life" column. The instruction clarified the editorial policy and tasks of the Party Life column, as well as the general content highlights of the articles. The Municipal Committee also decided to organize a "Party Life Editorial Committee" to hold regular meetings to study the editorial plan and reporting focus for each period. Tianjin Daily established a "Party Life Editorial Group" to be responsible for the daily editing and communication work of this column. The instruction stipulates that Party committees at all levels and all Party member cadres should take action, and the propaganda and organization committee members of each district committee and directly subordinate Party committee should be the natural correspondents of "Party Life." Each Party committee should recommend appropriate candidates as correspondents to regularly write and organize articles, introduce clues, and supply materials. Conscientiously implementing the various provisions in this decision will gradually enrich and substantiate the Party Life column of Tianjin Daily.
    
    Masses Daily's Struggle Against Suppressing Criticism
    In Yanchi County, Ningxia Province, more than 80,000 sheep died this spring. In addition to objective reasons, the bureaucracy of relevant departments of the Ningxia Provincial Construction Department and cadres of Yanchi County, and their lack of attention to animal husbandry work were also major reasons. A reporter from the Xi'an Masses Daily wrote a critical article on this matter. After the article was written, it was sent to Hao Yushan, Director of the Ningxia Provincial Construction Department, for review. Comrade Hao Yushan made various sophistries about the criticized events, adopted an extremely rude attitude towards the reporter, and refused to accept the method of jointly discussing and revising the manuscript or attaching different opinions as decided by the newspaper's editorial department, thereby rejecting and suppressing open criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications. On August 14th, Xi'an Masses Daily published the critical report on the large-scale death of sheep in Yanchi County and the process of Comrade Hao Yushan suppressing criticism on most of the front page, as well as a letter from Li Jinglin, Vice Chairman of the Ningxia Provincial People's Government, to the Xi'an Masses Daily for this incident, and published an editorial, pointing out that this is an extremely inappropriate bureaucratic attitude of treating criticism with sarcasm, attacks, and even abuse, and demanding that the Ningxia Provincial People's Government's Party organization and Discipline Inspection Commission seriously handle the matter and publish the handling results in the newspaper to educate Comrade Hao Yushan and the broad masses of cadres.
    The Hao Yushan's incident of suppressing criticism shows that nearly a year and a half after the Central Committee issued the decision to launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications, there are still a few responsible Party member cadres who adopt a rude attitude towards newspaper criticism. The publication of these materials by Xi'an Masses Daily is very meaningful. We should pay attention to seriously solving this problem.
    
    Eight Hundred Teachers and Students from Four Universities Including Beijing Formed the Central South Land Reform Work Group
    Xinhua News Agency: The Central South Land Reform Work Group, composed of more than 800 teachers and students from four universities including Beijing University, Tsinghua University, Yanjing University, and Fu Jen Catholic University, held its founding meeting in the auditorium of the Faculty of Engineering of Peking University on the 23rd. The group will go to the Central South Region in batches in early September to participate in the land reform work in this winter and next spring. The members of the group are all teachers and students from the law, political science, law, sociology, and economics departments of various universities. Their participation in land reform work is to connect with reality and learn from practical work. Now, they are concentrating on studying the policies of land reform at Peking University.
    
    Chongqing, Chengdu and Other Places Hold Political Course Teaching Seminars for Universities
    The Culture and Education Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee held political course teaching seminars in Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming and other places in order to summarize the teaching experience of political courses.
    The seminar in the Chongqing area began on August 1st at the Faculty of Arts of Chongqing University. The meeting was composed of a working committee of seven representatives from the Culture and Education Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, Chongqing University, Southwest Normal College, Southwest Industrial College and other units, responsible for planning, deployment and promoting all the work of the seminar. The seminar is scheduled for five weeks, with three weeks devoted to discussing several basic issues of political economy and formulating a teaching plan for the next term of the political economy course.
    
    The Content of the Dramas Performed by Some Rural Theaters in Heilongjiang Province is Wrong
    Heilongjiang Literature and Art News has recently published several critical articles about the scripts of rural theater troupes in several consecutive issues. The sixty-sixth issue published an article entitled "Do Not Perform Dramas that Violate Policies," pointing out that the play "Tao Ren" performed by the Tongbei Pingju Troupe seriously distorted the government's policies. The play described a district chief who actually interrogated a naughty elementary school student, Tao Ren, as a reactionary, using words such as "confession" and "leniency," and finally arbitrarily sentenced him to half a year in prison. This is indeed absurd, and it is also an ultra vires and illegal act for the district chief to impose a sentence. The article "Hurry Up and Strengthen Leadership" published in the sixty-seventh issue pointed out that the Pingju performed in Kedong County made extremely serious mistakes in the lines. For example, a student said, "All other things are base, only studying is noble," and the teacher also said that he was a good student. There are also words in the play such as "A good horse does not have two saddles, and a virtuous woman does not marry twice," which promote corrupt feudal ideas. The article "Opinions on the Performance of "Never Forgive Him Again"" published in the sixty-eighth issue pointed out the errors in the Pingju "Never Forgive Him Again" performed by the Tailai Business Association Troupe. The play tells the story of a special agent who was arrested and then sentenced to death on the spot by the village chief without the approval of the superior, and executed by shooting. This is also a phenomenon of disorganization and indiscipline, which violates the policies and laws of the People's Government.
    From the above serious errors, it seems that strengthening the ideological leadership of rural theater troupes is an extremely important task. Party organizations and government cultural and educational organs in various places must pay attention to this issue in order to improve rural literary and artistic activities.

　　天津市委决定加强天津日报党的生活栏
    八月十五日天津日报公布了中共天津市委员会的关于加强天津日报“党的生活”的指示，指示说明了党的生活栏的编辑方针与任务，和党的生活栏稿件的一般内容要点。市委并决定组织“党的生活编辑委员会”，定期开会，研究每一时期的编辑计划及报道要点，天津日报建立“党的生活编辑组”，负责这一栏的日常编辑及通讯工作。指示中规定，各级党委及全体党员干部应大家动手，各区委及直属党委的宣传委员、组织委员应为“党的生活”的当然通讯员，并由各党委推荐适当人选为通讯员，经常撰写及组织稿件，介绍线索及供给材料。认真地执行这个决定中的各种规定，将会使天津日报的党的生活栏逐渐丰富和充实起来。
　　群众日报对压制批评的斗争
    宁夏省盐池县，今年春天死亡羊达八万余只，除客观原因外，宁夏省建设厅有关部门和盐池县干部的官僚主义，对畜牧工作不重视也是主要原因。西安群众日报记者就此事写了批评稿件。稿子写好后，送请宁夏省政府建设厅长郝玉山审查，郝玉山同志对被批评的事件多方狡辩，对记者采取极横蛮的态度并拒不接受共同商量修改稿件或附写不同意见，由报社编辑部决定的办法，以拒绝和压制在报纸刊物上公开进行批评和自我批评。西安群众日报八月十四日以第一版大部分版面刊登盐池县羊只大量死亡的批评性的报道，及郝玉山同志压制批评的经过，宁夏省人民政府副主席李景林为此事件给西安群众日报的信，并发表社论，指出这是一种极不应有的以讽刺、打击，甚至谩骂对待批评的官僚主义态度，并要求宁夏省人民政府党组织和纪律检查委员会认真处理此事，将处理情况在报纸上公布，以教育郝玉山同志及广大干部。
    郝玉山同志压制批评事件说明，在中央发布了关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定将近一年半以后，还有少数负责的党员干部对报纸的批评采取粗暴的态度。西安群众日报发表这些材料很有意义。应该注意认真解决这个问题。

　　重庆、成都等地举办高等学校政治课教学讨论会
    西南军政委员会文教部，为总结政治课教学经验，在重庆、成都、贵阳、昆明等地举办高等学校政治课教学讨论会。
    重庆地区的讨论会已于八月一日在重庆大学文学院开始。该会由西南军政委员会文教部、重庆大学、西南师范学院、西南工业专科学校等单位代表七人组成工作委员会，负责进行计划、布置，并推动讨论会的一切工作。讨论会的时间预定五周，以三周时间讨论政治经济学的几个基本问题，并制订下期政治经济学课程的教学计划。
　　黑龙江省某些农村剧团  演出的戏剧内容有错误
    黑龙江文艺报最近数期连续发表了几篇关于农村剧团剧本的批评文章。第六十六期刊登了《不要演违反政策的剧》一文，指出通北评剧团所演出的“陶仁”一剧，严重歪曲了政府的政策，该剧描述一个区长，竟把一个调皮的小学生陶仁当作反动分子来审讯，用着“坦白”、“宽大”这种字眼，最后还任意判处了半年的徒刑。这的确是荒谬的，而且区长判刑，也是越权违法的。第六十七期刊登的《赶快加强领导》一文，指出克东县所演出的评剧，台词犯了极大的错误，如一个学生说“万般皆下品，惟有读书高”，老师还说他是好学生。剧词中还有“好马不备双鞍?，烈女不嫁二夫郎”等这样提倡腐朽的封建思想的话。第六十八期上登载了《对〈再不饶他〉演出的意见》一文，指出泰来商联剧团演出的评剧“再不饶他”的错误。剧中叙述一个特务被抓住之后，未经上级批准，就由村长当场判处死刑，执行枪决。这也是一种无组织无纪律的现象，违反人民政府政策法令的。
    从上面的严重错误看来，加强农村剧团的思想领导是极为重要的任务。各地党的组织和政府文教机关必须重视这个问题，以便把农村文艺活动提高一步。
