Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 1st: The commanders and fighters of a certain regiment in the Lijiang border defense area, guarding the southwest border of the motherland and composed of seventeen ethnic groups including the Mosuo, Bai, Lisu, Tibetan, and Yi from northwestern Yunnan, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, reporting on their growth in battle and expressing their determination to unite the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas and consolidate national defense. The letter stated: "As we greet the 'August 1st' Army Day with excitement, we cannot help but recall the dark and painful days experienced by the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Under the leadership of the underground organization of the Chinese Communist Party in Yunnan, we once engaged in a tenacious armed struggle against the Chiang bandit army and the armed forces of landlords and despots organized by Chiang's secret agents in a difficult environment, enabling the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas to be reborn."

The letter also stated: "The predecessor of our regiment was the 'Peasant Resistance Team,' composed of the Bai and other ethnic groups, which expanded from resisting the Kuomintang reactionary government's 'Three Exactions' (conscription, grain requisition, taxation) into a revolutionary armed force of all ethnic groups. In April 1949, a Bai peasant armed group with only sixteen rifles first raised the red flag of uprising in Jianchuan County, and then seized the weapons of the pseudo-police guard team at the Qiaohou Saltworks to the south. Subsequently, the Mosuo, Tibetan, Yi, and other ethnic groups in Lijiang, armed with muskets and hoes, held an anti-Chiang demonstration parade on 'May 1st.' With a powerful momentum, they forced the pseudo-Lijiang Commissioner's Office and the pseudo-county government to hand over guns and ammunition. The people's armed forces then equipped themselves with these weapons. In addition, the Tibetan people also revolted at the same time, forming a Tibetan cavalry unit and stationed in Heqing, the gateway to northwestern Yunnan. From then on, these armed forces of all ethnic groups merged together and launched a heroic struggle against the Kuomintang reactionary rulers. We gradually grew stronger in battle and successively liberated Jianchuan, Lijiang, Heqing, Yongsheng, Huaping, Lanping, Weixi and other counties, and established people's political power and democratic base areas. In early September 1949, under the leadership of the Party, we were honored with the official title of the Seventh Detachment of the Dian-Gui-Qian Border Column. Later, although the Chiang bandit army once invaded Lijiang twice with a superior force of thirteen regiments, attempting to wipe us out in one fell swoop, they were ultimately defeated by us."

The letter continued: "We have implemented Chairman Mao's policy of relying on the masses, established a flesh-and-blood relationship with the people of all ethnic groups, and therefore received their enthusiastic support. When we were persisting in arduous struggles, He Guixiu, a Mosuo labor model who had attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference, often worked with her sisters in the village under the moonlight to make straw sandals, weave straw hats, bake cakes, and grind fried noodles to support us. They repeatedly braved dense bullets, in the mountains and forests and on the battlefields, or crossed the blockade lines, to deliver food and meals to us. Old Grandma Wu Jinxu, who was over fifty years old, often delivered intelligence and propaganda materials to us under the strict surveillance of the bandit army. The people of all ethnic groups also brought their hunting guns and dry food, and in groups cooperated with us in combat. It was in this way that we relied on the masses and used indigenous weapons to defeat the well-equipped enemy."

The letter said: "Last February, the remnants of the bandit army under He Guoguang fled from Xichang along the Yanbian, attempting to infiltrate the Yunnan border. We crossed the Jinsha River at Yongsheng to intercept them, and in the battle, we successfully joined forces with the People's Liberation Army moving south, and jointly annihilated the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits. From then on, the people of northwestern Yunnan gained a stable life, and we were officially reorganized into a part of the glorious People's Liberation Army."

The letter concluded: "Respected Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, it is under the brilliant leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you that we have grown from the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, from a life of being enslaved and despised. As this great 'August 1st' Army Day arrives, we swear to you that we will unite the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas, consolidate national defense, and complete all the tasks entrusted to us by you."

　　十七个民族组成的某团指战员
    向毛主席朱总司令报告守卫边防的决心
    【新华社昆明一日电】守卫在祖国西南边疆，由云南西北部摩些族、民家族、傈僳族、藏族、彝族等十七个民族组成的丽江边防区某团全体指战员，在“八一”建军节前夕，写信向毛主席和朱总司令报告他们在战斗中成长的情形，及表示团结边疆各族人民，巩固国防的决心。信中写道：“在我们满怀着兴奋的心情来迎接‘八一’建军节时，不禁回想起边疆各族人民在蒋介石匪帮统治下过着黑暗痛苦日子的情景。我们在中共云南地下组织的领导下，曾经在艰苦的环境中和蒋匪军以及蒋匪特务所组织的地主恶霸武装，进行了顽强的武装斗争，使边疆各族人民获得新生。”
    信中并说：“我们这个团的前身是以民家等族组成的‘农民抗征队’，从反对国民党反动政府的‘三征’（征兵、征粮、征税）中扩大为各族人民的革命武装。一九四九年四月，一支仅有十六条步枪的民家族农民武装小组，首先在剑川县城高举起起义的红旗，随即向南夺取了乔后盐场伪警卫队的武装。接着，丽江的摩些、藏、彝等各族人民，拿着火枪、锄头，于‘五一’举行反蒋示威大游行后，以强大的声势，逼使伪丽江专员公署及伪县政府交出枪弹。人民武装便以此装备了自己。另外，藏族人民也于同时起义，组成藏族骑兵队，进驻滇西北的大门——鹤庆。从此，这几支各族人民的武装便汇合起来，和国民党反动统治者展开了英勇的斗争。我们在战斗中逐渐壮大，先后解放了剑川、丽江、鹤庆、永胜、华坪、兰坪、维西等县，并建立了人民政权和民主根据地。一九四九年九月初在党的领导下，荣受滇桂黔边纵队第七支队的正式称号。以后，蒋匪军虽曾以十三个团的优势兵力，两次进扰丽江，妄图一举消灭我们，但终被我们击败了。”
    信中继续写道：“我们实现了毛主席所指示的依靠群众的方针，与各族人民建立了血肉的联系，因而得到他们热烈的支援。在我们坚持艰苦斗争的时候，曾经出席全国劳动模范代表大会的摩些族劳动模范和国秀，经常和她村里的姊妹们，在月光下打草鞋，编草帽，烘饼子，磨炒面，支援我们。她们多次冒着密集的弹雨，在山林中和阵地上，或越过封锁线，给我们送粮送饭。五十多岁的吴金秀老大妈，在匪军严密监视下经常给我们递送情报和宣传品。各族人民并带上打野兽的火枪和干粮，成群结队的配合我们作战。我们就是这样依靠着群众，用土枪来击败了装备优良的敌人。”
    信中说：“去年二月，匪军贺国光残部从西昌沿盐边溃逃，妄图窜扰云南边境。我们曾经永胜渡金沙江，前往截击，在战斗中和南下的人民解放军胜利会师，共同歼灭了国民党残匪。从此，滇西北人民获得了安定的日子，我们正式改编为光荣的人民解放军的一部分。”
    信中最后写道：“敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令，我们就是这样在中国共产党，在您们的英明领导下，从反动的国民党统治下，从被奴役、被贱视的生活中，战斗成长起来的。当此伟大的‘八一’建军节到来的时候，我们向您们宣誓，一定紧密地团结边疆各族人民，巩固祖国国防，完成您们所交予的一切任务。”
