    A Family Letter
    By Liang Yulong
    (13) Your eldest sister-in-law and third sister-in-law and I, besides helping with farming, also have to cut pig grass, raise five pairs of ducks, spin more hemp thread, and save more. We ensure harmony between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law and take good care of your two little nephews.

    (14) Son, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, our lives are getting better day by day. We must never allow the imperialist aggressors to destroy our good life! Please tell all the comrades in the Volunteer Army that the parents, brothers, sisters, and siblings across the country are all concerned about you and are supporting you. You win more battles on the front lines, and we will produce more grain in the rear. Let's forever defend our good life!

    (15) After Wang Zhilong finished reading his mother's letter, the comrades of the Volunteer Army were extremely happy. They unanimously expressed that they would resolutely eliminate any enemy daring to invade, to respond to the care of the motherland and the people of the motherland for them.

    一封家信
    梁玉龙作
    （十三）我和你大嫂、三嫂，除了帮助种田，还要割猪草，要养五对鸭子，多打麻线，多节省，保证婆媳和气，把你两个小姪儿带好。
    （十四）娃娃，在毛主席领导下我们的日子是一天比一天好过了。我们的好光景是绝不能让帝国主义侵略者来破坏的。你转告全体志愿军同志们吧，全国的父母兄弟姊妹，都在关心你们，都在支援你们，你们在前方多打胜仗，我们在后方多打粮食。永远保卫我们的好生活！
    （十五）王治龙念完他妈妈的来信后，志愿军的同志们都高兴极了，他们一致表示要坚决消灭任何敢于进犯的敌人，来回答祖国的母亲和祖国的人民对他们的关怀。
