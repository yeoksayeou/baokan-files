Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 11th - Many newspapers across India have published editorials commenting on the proposal by Nikolai Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, in his reply to US President Truman, to conclude a Five-Power Peace Pact. The Calcutta Bengali newspaper *The Liberty* wrote in its editorial on the 9th: "The British and American imperialists will not easily agree to conclude this pact. They will not easily give up their conspiracy of war, colluding with each other. But the peace forces of the world (including India) will force the warmongers to agree to do so." The newspaper called on the Indian people to do everything possible to participate in the work of defending world peace and to further strengthen the signature campaign for the Peace Pact declaration.

　　The Lucknow English newspaper *National Herald* published an editorial on the 8th entitled "Message of Peace," saying: "Peace-loving people all over the world must support the resolution passed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR." The paper also said: "The letter from the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR expresses sincere and friendly feelings towards the people of the world."

　　印度报纸评论指出
    全世界关心和平的人民都拥护什维尔尼克建议
    【新华社新德里十一日电】印度全国各地许多报纸纷纷发表社论，评论苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克给美国总统杜鲁门的复信中提出的缔结五大国和平公约的建议。加尔各答孟加拉文报纸《自由报》九日的社论写道：“英、美帝国主义是不会轻易同意缔结这个公约的。他们不会轻易放弃狼狈为奸的战争阴谋。但是全世界（包括印度）的和平力量，将强迫战争贩子们同意这样做。”该报号召印度人民尽一切力量参加保卫世界和平的工作，进一步加强和平公约宣言签名运动。
    勒克瑙英文报纸《国民先驱报》于八日以《和平的信息》为题，发表社论说：“全世界关心和平的人民一定拥护苏联最高苏维埃主席团所通过的决议。”该报又说：“苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席的信件，表达了对全世界人民的真诚友好的感情。”
