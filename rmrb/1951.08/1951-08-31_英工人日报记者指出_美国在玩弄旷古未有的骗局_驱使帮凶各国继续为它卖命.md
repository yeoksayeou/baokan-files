　　British "Daily Worker" Reporter Points Out
    The United States is Playing an Unprecedented Fraud, Driving Accomplice Countries to Continue Serving It

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 29th] Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British "Daily Worker" in Kaesong, reported on the 28th: The world must know the truth: The U.S. side is playing an unprecedented fraud. It would only take two hours to investigate and find out: First, an aircraft dropped gasoline bombs and high-explosive fragmentation bombs, and strafed the headquarters of the Korean-Chinese delegation. Second, all the high-explosive bombs landed exactly between the headquarters and the press conference site. At that time, there were more than 150 people watching a movie inside the headquarters, including the leaders of the delegation. There is no pilot in the world who could aim at a target only two hundred yards away in the dark without hitting his own people. In order to intimidate witnesses and prevent them from speaking, the Americans spread rumors outside the neutral zone saying that Kaesong would be taken within a few days and 5,000 people would be killed. The photos taken on the night of the bombing showed that U.S. liaison officer Kenney was either a liar, extremely muddle-headed and incompetent, or an accomplice in the American conspiracy. In my opinion, he is all three. One photo showed him looking at a gasoline bomb casing and saying, "This is not a bomb, nor part of a bomb." Later, he became very careful and dared not approach any evidence.

    Ridgway is playing MacArthur. Like that dismissed general's move across the 38th parallel towards the Yalu River, he is presenting the United States' allies with a fait accompli. This is clear from the fact that the United States hastily closed all doors to negotiations based on Kenney's hastily drafted, contradictory report. The sons of people in many countries are driven into unpredictable adventures by a group of war maniacs in the Pentagon, working for General Motors and DuPont. They have the right to know the truth and must insist on knowing the truth. The Americans know all this in their hearts, so they are strictly preventing any real investigation. However, the British people must not be deceived again. The British people should rise up and demand to know the truth.

　　英工人日报记者指出
    美国在玩弄旷古未有的骗局
    驱使帮凶各国继续为它卖命
    【新华社二十九日讯】英国伦敦《工人日报》记者阿兰·魏宁顿二十八日自开城报道说：应当使全世界知道事实的真象：美方在玩弄旷古未有的大骗局。只消两个钟头就可以调查明白：第一，有一架飞机投了汽油弹、高度爆炸杀伤弹，扫射了朝中代表团的总部；第二，所有的高度爆炸弹都恰好落在这总部和新闻记者招待所之间，那时总部里面有一百五十多人在看电影，其中有代表团的领袖。世界上还没有这样的驾驶员能在黑夜里瞄准只差两百码的地方而不炸中自己的人。美国人为了恫吓见证人，使他们不敢说话，就在中立区外散播谣言说：几天内拿下了开城，要把五千人杀光。发生轰炸事件那晚上拍的照片说明了：美方联络官肯尼不是一个撒谎家，就是极端颟顸无能，再不然就是美国阴谋的同谋犯。照我看来，他是三者兼备。有一张照片拍出他正在看汽油弹弹皮，他说：“这不是炸弹，也不是炸弹的一部分。”后来他就大加小心，不敢走近任何证物了。
    李奇微正在扮演麦克阿瑟。他像那位被革了职的将军越过三八线向鸭绿江推进的作法一样，把既成事实摆在美国的盟国面前。这一点，只要看美国根据肯尼仓猝草成的矛盾百出的报告赶紧把谈判的一切大门关死，就可以了然。许多国家人民的儿子被五角大楼一群战争疯子驱入前途未可预卜的冒险，为通用汽车公司和杜邦卖命，他们有权知道事实，而且必须坚持要知道事实。美国人心里明白这一切，所以严防进行任何真正的调查。可是，英国人民决不要再受骗了。英国人民应该起来要求知道真象。
