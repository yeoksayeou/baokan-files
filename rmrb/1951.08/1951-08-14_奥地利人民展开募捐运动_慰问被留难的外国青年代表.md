Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, August 11th: The municipal authorities of Innsbruck, Austria, have stopped providing food to the two thousand youth representatives from Britain, France, and other countries who were detained in Austria on their way to the World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace in Berlin, attempting to thwart their will to participate in the festival. Currently, youth throughout Austria are widely launching a fundraising campaign under the slogan "Don't let our French and British youth friends go hungry." Workers from various enterprises and democratic organizations in Vienna, the Austrian capital, have donated large amounts of consolation money. Working people from various regions organized delegations on the 9th to go to Innsbruck to express their condolences. A delegation from the Austrian Democratic Women's League went to the US Embassy in Austria on the 9th to lodge a firm protest against the illegal detention of young peace fighters.
