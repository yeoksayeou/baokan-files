    Article 2. Any person engaged in the radio equipment business must apply for registration with the Public Security Bureau or Sub-bureau of the relevant city (county) People's Government. The procedures are as follows:

    2. Provide a list of managers, shareholders, and employees, and a simplified floor plan of the building facilities (vendors selling and repairing radio equipment are exempt from submitting the floor plan).
    3. After the Public Security Bureau has reviewed and approved the application, a special business license will be issued, and the applicant must apply for registration with the relevant industry and commerce authority and obtain a business license before being allowed to operate.
    Article 3. If a licensed radio equipment factory or business changes its name, manager, shareholders, or expands, relocates, changes industry, or ceases operations, it must first obtain permission from the Public Security Bureau before proceeding with other formalities.
    Article 4. All licensed factories and businesses shall prepare two copies of a detailed report form on the production, sales, and inventory of radio equipment, and submit them to the Public Security Bureau or Sub-bureau on a monthly basis.
    Article 5. Anyone who needs to purchase radio transmitting equipment and receivers must hold a certificate from the relevant agency or organization, first fill out an application form with detailed information on the intended use and the type, name, and quantity of equipment to be purchased, and obtain a purchase permit issued by the Public Security Bureau before being allowed to purchase the equipment. All licensed factories and businesses shall conduct transactions based on the purchase permit and submit the permit along with the report form on the production, sales, and inventory of equipment to the Public Security Bureau or Sub-bureau on a monthly basis. Mutual purchases and sales between factories and businesses shall also be handled in accordance with the same procedure.
    Article 6. Anyone who needs to have restricted equipment such as transmitters and receivers repaired by a licensed factory or business must first send a detailed written request to the Public Security Bureau. After the Public Security Bureau approves the request and issues a repair permit, the factories and businesses shall perform the repairs based on the permit and submit the permit along with the report form on the production, sales, and inventory of equipment to the Public Security Bureau or Sub-bureau on a monthly basis.
    Article 7. Any non-profit entity that already possesses radio transmitting equipment shall register with the Public Security Bureau or Sub-bureau and may continue to possess the equipment only after approval.
    Article 8. Purchasers of registered equipment (see Article 9 of the attached list) may not be subject to the restrictions of Articles 5, 6, and 7. All licensed factories and businesses must fill out the production, sales, and inventory report form and submit it to the Public Security Bureau or Sub-bureau on a monthly basis.
    Article 9. All imported and transshipped radio equipment, in addition to obtaining import or transshipment permits from foreign trade authorities, must be inspected and approved by the Public Security Bureau.
    Article 10. When transporting equipment within the scope of these regulations, a transit permit must first be obtained from the Public Security Bureau.
    Article 11. All factories, businesses, or citizens who discover suspicious customers, black market transactions, or concealment of radio transmitting equipment shall promptly report them to the local People's Public Security Agency. If the report is verified to be true, the original reporter shall be rewarded. Absolute confidentiality shall be maintained for those who need to keep their identity secret.
    Article 12. Anyone who refuses to comply with the above provisions of these regulations, fails to report within the time limit, or makes false reports shall be punished according to the circumstances once discovered.
    Article 13. Public security personnel shall present their credentials when performing their duties, and factories and businesses shall not refuse. If they do not have such credentials, they may be turned over to the People's Public Security Agency for handling according to the law.
    Article 14. The Public Security Departments of the People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) of the Major Administrative Areas may formulate supplementary measures based on these regulations. If it is necessary for the People's Public Security Agencies of provinces, cities, and counties to formulate supplementary measures, they must be approved by the Public Security Department of the Major Administrative Area.
    Article 15. These regulations have been approved by the Political and Legal Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and shall be promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government.
