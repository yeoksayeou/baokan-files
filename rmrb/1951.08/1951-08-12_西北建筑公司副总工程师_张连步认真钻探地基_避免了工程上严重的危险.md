Zhang Lianbu, Deputy Chief Engineer of Northwest Construction Company, Carefully Explores the Foundation, Avoiding Serious Engineering Dangers

Zhang Lianbu, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Northwest Construction Company, demonstrated the responsibility that technical workers should have for the people's cause by carefully conducting drilling and exploration of the foundation during the construction of the warehouse project for the state-owned Xianyang Cotton Textile Factory. The warehouse project of the state-owned Xianyang Cotton Textile Factory is one of the largest basic construction projects of the Northwest Industrial Department this year. Deputy Chief Engineer Zhang went to the construction site in person to supervise the work when he was in charge of the project. When he discovered tombs under the foundation of the warehouse, he immediately organized the workers to drill and explore under the foundations of all the cement columns. One hundred and twenty holes were drilled, and no more tombs were found. Therefore, some workers thought that drilling like this was too labor-intensive and were unwilling to continue drilling. At that time, Deputy Chief Engineer Zhang encouraged everyone and said, "Now is different from the past. We must be responsible to the people. If we drill one hundred holes and find one tomb, that is our achievement. If there is not even one, our work is not in vain, because we can rest assured about the future engineering guarantee issues." As a result, a total of two hundred and thirty holes were drilled, and seven tombs were indeed found. A total of fifty-seven tombs were found by digging and drilling, one of which was as long as 2.7 meters, one meter wide, and 3.5 meters deep. Such a large tomb was right under a cement column in the cleaning room. The cement column was going to carry tens of thousands of pounds. If this tomb was not filled properly, the cement column would inevitably sink, causing losses to the project and wasting state property. Because of Deputy Chief Engineer Zhang's serious responsibility to the people's cause, this loss was avoided and the guarantee of the project was ensured. The Northwest Industrial Department issued a circular on this matter, commending Deputy Chief Engineer Zhang's spirit of being responsible for the people's cause. (Xigong)

　　西北建筑公司副总工程师  张连步认真钻探地基
    避免了工程上严重的危险
    西北建筑公司副总工程师张连步在修建国营咸阳棉纺织厂仓库工程中，认真地进行钻探，表现了技术工作者对人民事业应有的负责精神。国营咸阳棉纺织厂仓库工程是西北工业部本年度基本建设中最大工程之一。张副总工程师在负责该项工程中，亲赴工地进行监工。当他发现仓库地基下有墓穴时，立即组织职工在所有的洋灰柱的地基下，进行钻探。钻了一百二十个眼，并未再发现有墓穴存在，因此有些职工认为这样钻下去太费工了，不愿意再继续钻探。当时张副总工程师就鼓励大家说：“现在比不得从前了，我们要对人民负责，钻一百个洞有一个墓穴，这就是我们的成绩；如果一个也没有，我们的工也没有白费，因为我们对将来的工程保固问题总算是放心了。”结果共钻了二百三十个眼，果然发现墓穴七处，连挖带钻共找到墓穴五十七个，其中有一个墓穴长达二点七公尺，宽有一公尺，深至三点五公尺；这样大的一个墓穴恰恰就在清花间的一根洋灰柱的正下方。该洋灰柱将要载重数万斤。这个墓穴如不填好，洋灰柱势必陷落，使得工程遭受损失，造成国家财产的浪费。由于张副总工程师对人民事业的认真负责，就避免了这种损失，保证了工程的保固。西北工业部为这件事发出通报，表扬张副总工程师这种对人民事业负责的精神。（西工）
