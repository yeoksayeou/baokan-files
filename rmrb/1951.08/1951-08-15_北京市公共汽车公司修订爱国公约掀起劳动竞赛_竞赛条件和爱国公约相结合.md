To the Editor:

Having read the news about the Ma Hengchang Group formulating a patriotic competition pact, published in the People's Daily on July 26th, we believe that this method of combining a patriotic pact with a labor competition is correct and should be widely promoted. The situation of our Beijing Public Bus Company revising and implementing the patriotic pact for several months has already confirmed this point.

The Public Bus Company's patriotic pact was established at the end of April. Initially, it was done by workshop, and then in early May, we further began establishing group pacts. Now, 128 groups have established pacts, accounting for 92.5 percent of all employees. Through the establishment of the patriotic pact, the political consciousness of employees has been raised, and some achievements have been made in production. For example, the failure rate of Route 5 buses averaged 13 minutes per 100 kilometers in April. Since the establishment of the pact, it has been reduced to 8 minutes in May and is now down to 5 minutes. Oil consumption has increased from 362 kilometers per gallon to 386 kilometers, and now has increased to 569 kilometers. These are all the practical effects caused by the patriotic pact in our company.

However, the shortcoming of our initial establishment and implementation of the patriotic pact was that we did not closely combine and unify the labor competition with the patriotic pact, forming three separate tasks, dispersing the strength of cadres, resulting in each task being intermittently hot and cold. The movement to respond to the Ma Hengchang Group was initially proceeding vigorously, cadres went deep into the factories to cultivate typical groups and exchange advanced experience, but when other central tasks came, it had to be put aside. The situation of establishing and implementing the patriotic pact was the same. This affected the effect of patriotic education on workers, and also affected the inability to obtain greater achievements in production.

Because the patriotic pact was not more closely combined with production tasks, many of the pact's clauses were empty political slogans. This reduced the significance and role of the patriotic pact. At the end of June, under the direct leadership of the Party General Branch and the higher-level trade union, the trade union conducted an inspection of the patriotic pact, discovered these shortcomings, and thereby initially explored that: to make the patriotic pact a regular patriotic movement, every central task must become a component of the patriotic pact, especially labor competition, must be unified under the patriotic pact, and competition and challenges must be realized through the implementation of the patriotic pact. Therefore, the trade union immediately publicized this spirit to the workshops. The Wang Delu advanced group of Route 3 first re-examined and revised the group pact with this spirit, incorporating conditions such as improving the departure rate, reducing failures, reducing fuel consumption, and ensuring safe driving into the patriotic pact, and proposed challenges to everyone. With the support and mobilization of the trade union, the Chen Hongshan group and others united to challenge and respond to each other, thereby driving other groups. The actual effect of the patriotic pact of each production group in our factory on promoting production has since been further improved, and advanced groups such as Vehicle No. 68 and Vehicle No. 150, which revised and implemented the pact, have emerged. Now that we have read the news about the Ma Hengchang Group formulating a patriotic competition pact, we are even more confident. Recently, the trade union decided to promote the experience of the advanced group's patriotic competition pact to each group.

    修订爱国公约掀起劳动竞赛  竞赛条件和爱国公约相结合
    编辑同志：
    读了七月二十六日人民日报发表的马恒昌小组订立爱国竞赛公约的消息，我们认为这样把爱国公约和劳动竞赛结合起来的办法是正确的，应该普遍地加以推广。从我们北京市公共汽车公司数月来修订和执行爱国公约的情况中，已经证实了这一点。
    公共汽车公司的爱国公约是在四月底就订立起来的。刚开始时是以车间为单位，至五月上旬才进一步开始订立小组公约。现在已经有一百二十八个小组订出公约，占全体职工人数百分之九十二点五。通过了订立爱国公约，提高了职工的政治觉悟，在生产上有了一些成绩。如：第五路车四月份故障率平均百公里十三分钟，自从订立公约以后，五月份降低至八分钟，现在则降低至五分钟。机油消耗由每加仑三百六十二公里提高到三百八十六公里，现在竟提高到五百六十九公里。这些都是爱国公约在我们公司所引起的实际效果。
    但是，我们订立和执行爱国公约开始时的缺点，就在于没有把劳动竞赛和爱国公约密切地结合、统一起来，形成三项工作同时进行，干部力量分散，以致每一项工作都是忽冷忽热。本来向马恒昌小组应战运动正进行得起劲，干部下厂深入培养典型小组，交流先进经验，但别的中心工作一来了只好放下不管。订立和执行爱国公约的情况也是这样。这样即影响对工人进行爱国主义教育的效果，也影响生产上不能获得更大的成绩。
    由于爱国公约没有和生产任务更密切地相结合，因此，公约条文很多是空洞的政治口号。这样就降低了爱国公约的意义和作用。六月底在党总支部和上级工会直接领导下，工会进行爱国公约检查时，发现了这些缺点，并从而初步摸索到：要使爱国公约成为经常性的爱国运动，必须使每一项中心工作成为爱国公约的组成部分，特别是劳动竞赛，必须统一在爱国公约下面，通过执行爱国公约来实现竞赛和挑战。因此，工会即向各车间宣传这一精神。三路王德禄先进小组首先以这一精神重新检查和修订了小组公约，把提高出车率、减少故障、降低油耗和保证安全行驶等条件订进爱国公约里去，并向大伙提出挑战。在工会的支持发动下，陈洪善等小组便联合起来互相挑战应战，从而带动了其他的小组。本厂各生产小组爱国公约对于推动生产的实际效果，自此之后更加提高，并且涌现了六十八号车和一五○号车等修订和执行公约的先进小组。现在我们看了马恒昌小组订立爱国竞赛公约的消息，心里更有了底。最近工会决定把先进小组的爱国竞赛公约的经验推广到各小组去。
