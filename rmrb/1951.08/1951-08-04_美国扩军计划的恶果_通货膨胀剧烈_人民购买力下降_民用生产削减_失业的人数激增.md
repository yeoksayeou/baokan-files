Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Truman government's military expansion plan, designed to reap huge profits for monopoly capital, has already inflicted serious harm on the American economy.

First, the government's massive military spending has triggered rampant inflation and a corresponding decline in people's purchasing power. The extent of the inflation can be seen in the soaring prices. According to the U.S. government's Bureau of Labor Statistics' invariably understated statistics, although consumer prices have temporarily fallen somewhat since mid-May due to the shrinking consumer goods market, the wholesale price index for the week ending July 17 was still 14 percent higher than before the Korean War, at 178.8 percent of the 1926 average.

The decline in people's purchasing power is significantly reflected in the reduction of retail trade volume. Due to prices having risen to prohibitive levels, the decline in sales of civilian goods began in March of this year. The national retail volume in March fell by an average of 5 percent compared to February. As a result of the devaluation of the dollar, although the retail trade volume in monetary terms was still 3 percent higher than a year earlier, the actual trade volume was far lower than in March of last year. Now, according to a report by the New York Dun & Bradstreet statistical office, for the week ending July 25, the national retail trade volume, even in monetary terms, averaged lower than the same week last year. The largest drop was 4 percent lower than a year ago.

Another evil consequence of the military expansion plan is the reduction of civilian production, which has resulted in a new wave of mass unemployment. Currently, the amount of steel used for manufacturing consumer goods has been reduced by one-third compared to before the Korean War. Since June, 75 percent of carbon steel plate and 68 percent of heavy construction steel plate have been allocated for military use. The civilian use of other important industrial raw materials such as copper and lead has also been drastically reduced, resulting in a significant impact on the production of civilian industries. Many small businesses producing consumer goods have either shut down or reduced production. In large industries, nearly 100,000 workers in the automotive industry in Detroit alone have become unemployed, and this number is still increasing. Truman recently admitted in a speech in that city: "In the coming months, we will still have this unemployment problem arising from the transition."

Truman's Council of Economic Advisers has predicted that this situation will continue and become more serious. In a report attached to the President's Mid-Year Economic Report submitted to Congress on July 23, the Council stated clearly: "As production under the defense plan (military expansion plan) increases, the fundamental inflationary pressures caused by the plan seem very likely to increase to a serious extent." The Council emphasized that the $7.2 billion tax increase plan, which had been passed by the House last month and would increase federal tax revenue to an unprecedented high of more than $60 billion, "neither balances the budget nor provides the necessary support for a plan to control inflation."

At the same time that the broad masses of working people are bearing the serious economic consequences of the military expansion plan, monopoly capitalists are getting real benefits from the Truman government. In his Mid-Year Economic Report, Truman proudly boasted of his achievement, saying: pre-tax corporate profits for the first half of 1951 are estimated to have reached a record high annual rate of $50 billion, an increase of approximately 60 percent over the first half of last year. It is precisely because of this that, although the Korean armistice negotiations are underway, Truman still wants to announce that military spending, which has already doubled compared to a year ago, will increase by almost another double next year; he still insists on increasing the $10 billion in new taxes, which even he himself has to consider "already too heavy."

　　美国扩军计划的恶果
    通货膨胀剧烈
    人民购买力下降
    民用生产削减  失业的人数激增
    【新华社讯】杜鲁门政府为垄断资本牟取巨利的扩张军备计划已经给美国经济造成了严重的恶果。
    首先，政府的巨大军费开支引起了剧烈的通货膨胀和人民购买力的相应下降。通货膨胀的程度可以从物价的飞升上看出来。据美国政府劳工统计局通常总是压低了的统计，虽然自五月中旬以来，由于销费品市场的萎缩，物价暂时有了一些下跌，在七月十七日以前的一周中，批发物价指数仍较朝鲜战争前高百分之十四，为一九二六年平均数的百分之一百七十八点八。
    人民购买力的下降显著地反映在零售贸易量的缩减上。由于物价已涨到令人却步，民用货物销售量的下降从今年三月就开始了。三月全国零售量较二月份平均跌了百分之五。由于美元贬值的结果，零售贸易量以货币计算起来虽然仍旧高于一年前百分之三，但是，实际贸易量已远低于去年三月。现在，据纽约邓·布列德斯特里统计所的报告，截至七月二十五日为止一周中，全国零售贸易量，甚至以货币计算平均也低于去年同周的水平。跌落最多的已较一年前低百分之四。
    扩军计划的另一个恶果是民用生产受到削减，因此而产生了新的大量失业现象。目前，用于制造消费品的钢已较朝鲜战争前削减三分之一，自六月起，百分之七十五的碳钢板和百分之六十八的重建筑用钢板又被拨作军用。其他重要工业原料如铜和铅的民用量也大量削减，结果就使得民用工业部门的生产因此大受影响，许多生产消费品的小企业已行停工或减产。在大工业方面，仅仅底特律一地的汽车工业中，因此而失业的工人就近十万人，这个数目还正在增加。杜鲁门最近在该市发表演说时承认：“在未来数月中，我们仍会有这个在转变过程中所产生的失业问题”。
    杜鲁门的经济顾问委员会已经预告，上面这种情况将继续下去并更趋严重。该委员会在附在总统年中经济报告一起于七月二十三日提交国会的一份报告中明白地说：“随着防御计划（扩军计划）下生产的增加，该计划所引起的根本上的通货膨胀压力看来很可能会增加到严重的程度。”该委员会强调，众院在上月下旬已经通过的、将使联邦税收增加到六百多亿美元的空前高额的七十二亿美元增税计划，“既不能平衡预算，又不能给控制通货膨胀的计划以必要的支持”。
    就在广大劳动人民承受扩军计划的严重经济恶果的时候，垄断资本家却得到了杜鲁门政府真正的好处。杜鲁门在他的年中经济报告中曾得意地眩耀他的这种功劳说：一九五一年上半年纳税前的公司利润估计达到年率五百亿美元的创记录高度，即比去年上半年增加了大约百分之六十。正是因为如此，虽然朝鲜停战谈判已在进行，但杜鲁门仍然要宣告目前已经较一年前增加了一倍的军费到明年还要增加差不多一倍；仍然要坚持增加连他自己也不得不认为“已嫌过重”的一百亿美元新税。
