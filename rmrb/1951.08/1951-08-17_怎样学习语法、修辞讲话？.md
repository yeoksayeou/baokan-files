　　How to Learn Grammar and Rhetoric?
　　Editor's Note: The question raised by Comrade Lu Xuehai on how to learn "grammar and rhetoric" is a common problem that many grammar learners want to solve. Many people often make slow progress in learning grammar because they lack correct learning methods. In order to help readers like Comrade Lu Xuehai learn grammar well, we have decided to publish Comrade Lu Xuehai's letter and the replies from Mr. Lu Shuxiang and Mr. Zhu Dexi here.

　　To Mr. Lu Shuxiang and Mr. Zhu Dexi:
　　I work in communications and journalism. In the past, when making work reports, summaries, and other writing, I felt that my grammar skills were insufficient. Sometimes, the sentences were very awkward and could not express my meaning. I have also read your speeches published in the People's Daily in my spare time, but I find learning difficult. Therefore, I am writing this letter to you, and I would like you to answer the following questions:
　　1. I understand the examples you gave; but when I look at another piece of writing, I don't understand it, and I find it difficult. The learning progress is very slow. Can you give me instructions on how to learn?
　　2. Can grammar be learned and applied at the same time? Please instruct me on how to proceed.
　　3. What are some reference materials for learning in this area? Please introduce them to me according to each section of content.
　　4. Finally, I have such a request: I know that there are many people like me who would like to learn this course. It is very good to serialize it in the newspaper, but can you compile a learning outline and some practice questions, and organize correspondence courses in the form of mimeographed (preferably typeset) handouts to help everyone learn?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Lu Xuehai, Propaganda Department of the Shaoxing County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China

　　Reply from Lu Shuxiang and Zhu Dexi
　　To ask how to learn grammar, one must first ask why learn grammar. Different learning goals determine different learning methods. Some people learn grammar to understand the rules of the language. They already have no major problems in the practical application of the language, but they want to find out its various rules and gain a systematic understanding. This is a research attitude. Others learn grammar because they often encounter difficulties when using the language, mainly in writing, and want to overcome these difficulties by learning grammar. This is a practical attitude. Our speech is written for the latter type of people. From the second lecture to the sixth lecture is its main body, specifically talking about practical problems, not engaging in empty talk. The first lecture serves the following five lectures. Because some terms will be used later, it is not a good idea to annotate them as they appear, so I will first briefly explain them in general. If you regard it as the main content of this speech, then it is completely not our original intention. If so, why bother with the following five lectures? If so, it must not be so brief, and it would take five or six times the space. Many issues must be fully explained—just to give an example, such as which situations allow the absence of a subject in a sentence, and which situations allow the subject to appear after the predicate. But in this case, it is written for people whose purpose is research, not for people whose purpose is practical application.
　　For people whose purpose is practical, our advice is: read the first lecture from beginning to end. If you understand everything (this is not difficult), that's very good, and you don't need to delve into it or ask for generalization (if you can do that, it's naturally better, but it can't be forced). If you can't understand everything, understand as much as you can. Then read the second lecture, the third lecture... When you encounter relevant places, refer back to the first lecture. By reading back and forth like this, what you didn't understand the first time will be understood later, and what you couldn't apply the first time can be applied later. The above answers the first and second points of the original letter.
　　Third point, reference materials. This is important for those who aspire to research. If the purpose is only practical, wait until you have finished reading these six lectures. Listing many books at the outset, with conflicting opinions, will only confuse people and will not be beneficial.
　　Fourth point, learning outline and exercises. An outline is not necessary, the sections and subsections, each with a title, are already clear enough. This speech deals with many individual problems, unlike other subjects (such as the history of social development), which can use fewer words to summarize the main ideas. We also have more to say about some issues, and generally there are one or two concluding sentences at the end. Exercises, we have thought about it. They will be added when the separate edition is printed. (In order to meet the needs of readers, there are also plans to print and distribute each lecture separately.) Correspondence courses require a large amount of manpower and material resources, and even if the two of us did nothing else and specialized in this matter, we could not undertake it. And in our opinion, it is not necessary. If you can organize study groups, it will be very effective, better than studying alone.

### 怎样学习语法、修辞讲话？

　　怎样学习语法、修辞讲话？
    编者按：陆学海同志所提出的怎样学习“语法、修辞讲话”的问题，是许多语法学习者要求解决的共同问题。许多人在学习语法时，往往因为没有正确的学习方法，因而进步很慢。为了帮助和陆学海同志一样的读者学好语法，所以我们决定把陆学海同志的信和吕叔湘、朱德熙两先生的复信，在这里发表。
                                            吕叔湘  朱德熙二位先生：
    我是做通讯和新闻工作的。在以往做工作汇报、工作总结、及其他写作时，都感到语法修养很不够。有时候，句子弄得很不顺，不能表现我的意思。人民日报上登载的你们二位的讲话，我也在业余时间看了，但是感到学习还有困难。因此我就写这个信给你们，务请给我答复下面几个问题：
    一、我看了你们举的例子，是懂了；换一篇东西，自己再看，就不知道了，就感到困难。学习的进度很慢。你们能不能把怎样学习的方法指示我？
    二、学习语法是不是能一面学一面运用？请指示我怎样进行。
    三、这方面的学习参考资料有些什么？请根据每段内容介绍给我。
    四、最后还有这样一个要求：我知道有很多像我这样情况的人，很想学习这门课程。在报上连载下去是很好的，但你们能否再编一个学习纲要和一些练习题目，采取用油印（最好铅印）的讲义形式，组织起函授来，帮助大家学习？
                                中共绍兴县委宣传部  陆学海
    吕叔湘、朱德熙答
    要问怎样学习语法，先得问为什么学习语法。不同的学习目的决定不同的学习方法。有些人学习语法是为了了解语文的规律。他们在语文的实际运用上已经没有多大问题，只是要找出它的种种规律，得一个系统的了解。这是研究的态度。另外有些人学习语法是因为他们在运用语文的时候，主要是在写作的时候，常常遇到一些困难，要借学习语法来克服这些困难。这是实用的态度。我们这个讲话是为后面这种人写的。从第二讲到第六讲是它的主体，专门就实际问题说话，不尚空谈。第一讲是为以后五讲服务的。因为后面要应用一些术语，随时出现随时注解不是个办法，所以先总起来大略说明一下。如果把它当作这个讲话的主要内容看，那就完全不是我们的本意了。要是如此，何必还要以下五讲？要是如此，就决不能这样简略，得用上五、六倍的篇幅。许多问题都得加以充分的说明——随便举例，如哪些情况容许句子里没有主语，哪些情况容许主语在谓语之后出现。但是这样一来，就是为目的在于研究的人写的，不是为目的在于实用的人写的了。
    对于目的在于实用的人，我们的劝告是：把第一讲从头到尾看一遍。都懂了（这并不难），就很好，不必再去寻根究底，或是要求触类旁通（能那样，自然更好，但勉强不得）。万一不能全懂，懂多少是多少。接下去就看第二讲，第三讲……。遇到相关的地方，再回过来参考第一讲。这样来回地看，头一回没看懂的后来也会懂，头一回不能应用的后来也能应用。以上回答原信一、二两点。
    第三点，参考资料。对于志在研究的人，这是重要的。要是目的只在实用，且等看完这六讲再说。一上手就罗列许多书，众说纷纭，徒乱人意，没有什么好处。
    第四点，学习纲要和练习。纲要不必了，分段分节，各有标题，已经够明白。这个讲话处理的是许多个别的问题，不像别种科目（例如社会发展史），能用较少的话来综括大意。有些问题我们说的话也较多，大抵在最后都有一两句结论。练习，我们想到了。印单行本的时候要加进去。（为了适应读者的需要，还计划分讲印行。）函授，需要大量的人力物力，即使我们两个人不做别的工作，专门做这一件事，也担任不下。而且照我们看，也没有必要。如果能组织学习小组，也就很能收效，比一个人独学好。
