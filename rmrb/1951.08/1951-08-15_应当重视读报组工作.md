The Work of Reading Groups Should Be Valued
    Yang Nong'an
    According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 60,372 reading groups established nationwide, with 683,805 workers, farmers, students, staff, and citizens participating. In Shaanxi and Suiyuan provinces, almost every village has established a reading group. In Zhongwei County, Ningxia, 80% of adults in the second district and fourth township participate in reading groups, with an average of one newspaper for every ten households, achieving "every village has a newspaper, every household reads the newspaper." Reading groups have also been widely established in border areas such as Yunnan and Xikang. Although its development is not balanced in all regions, it has played a significant role and has become an important organizational form for the masses to regularly study current affairs and policies.
            
            Reading Groups Promote Mass Work
    Propaganda and education through reading newspapers have powerfully promoted the work of resisting America, aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. For example, in Suiyuan Province, after reading about the atrocities of American imperialism in Korea, coupled with recalling the crimes of Japanese invaders, American troops, and Chiang bandits, the reading groups aroused the masses' hatred of American imperialism. They launched accusations one after another. The victory news of the Chinese and Korean People's troops on the Korean battlefield encouraged the masses' fighting will. "Plant more land, produce more grain, support the Volunteer Army!" has become a consistent slogan and action of the broad masses of farmers in Suiyuan. Under the leadership and mobilization of the reading groups, Wudong County alone donated more than 500 dan of grain, 300 sheep, 10 cattle, and more than 400 consolation bags. At the Bao-tou County Reading Group Leaders' Conference, it was also proposed to donate a "Bao-tou People's" anti-aircraft gun and discuss specific ways to mobilize the masses to increase production and donate. Reading groups have also played a significant role in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and banning reactionary sects. For example, in Tangdichang Hanwu Village, Wudong County, Suiyuan, after propaganda and education by the reading group, eleven qing of illegally occupied land were reported. Last winter, based on the farmers' class hatred, the reading group guided them to actively fight against landlords, despots, bandits, and special agents; the peasants were generally organized, implementing village-to-village joint defense and household-to-household supervision, leaving no loopholes for bandits and special agents. For example, under the promotion of the Fushan-suo reading group in Qingdao, 120 people in the whole village withdrew from the Yiguandao sect.
            
            Leadership of Reading Groups Should be Valued
    Experience has proved that in areas where leading comrades value reading groups, the work of reading groups is relatively well done. However, how to make cadres universally value the leadership of reading groups? On this point, clearing up the cadres' thinking is a prerequisite. Some cadres think that they are too busy with work and have no time. However, the facts in various places show that reading groups are a powerful weapon to help cadres promote various tasks, just as Yu Fangshui, secretary of the Kaoshan Village Branch in Haiyang County, Shandong Province, said: "Newspapers are the shoulders of our village cadres. Using newspapers to implement work is much better than our cadres talking with their mouths; doing according to the newspapers is timely, in-depth, accurate, and saves time. This method is the best." Some cadres think that the masses are backward and do not like to read newspapers; in fact, the opposite is true. The masses are eager to understand the various policies of the People's Government, current affairs, and production knowledge. In Haiyang County, Shandong Province, because newspapers have solved many practical problems for the masses, the masses generally call newspapers "teachers" and "helmsmen." They regard reading newspapers as an indispensable part of life. Some cadres also said: "The cultural level of the masses is low, and reading groups may not be established." However, in fact, the masses are asking to join reading groups precisely because they urgently need culture. Still other cadres say: "Our area is sparsely populated and transportation is very difficult, so reading groups cannot be established." This is also not a valid excuse. For example, Huaping County in Xikang Province, although it is a mountainous area, has also established reading groups. Also, in Suiyuan United Banner, where villages are even dozens of miles apart, sixteen reading groups have been established.
            
            Reading Groups Should be Combined with Propaganda Networks
    After the reading group is combined with the propaganda network, the "old routine" and "speaking carelessly" problems of the propagandists can be avoided. For example, many propagandists in Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, initially encountered difficulties in propaganda because they did not pay attention to the method of applying reading newspapers. They said, "There is nothing in my belly, what is there to propagate." Later, the method of reading newspapers was adopted, which made the work proceed smoothly. The reading group itself also expanded with the expansion of the propaganda network. On the other hand, if the reading group can use rest time to conduct reading newspapers in workers' spare-time schools, civil schools, or factory workshops, it will not delay the production and learning of the masses, and will surely be welcomed by the masses.
            
            Content Should Meet the Needs of the Masses
    In addition to selecting important current affairs news, the reading group can also select some articles on production and health knowledge according to the needs of the masses to increase the interest of the masses. For example, the Xianggongzhuang Village Reading Group in Lulong County, Hebei Province, introduced the method of treating swine fever to the group members. Yu Jinde, a veteran of the Kaoshan Village in Dashan District, Haiyang, Shandong Province, has learned methods such as accumulating urine, accumulating dry ash, selecting seeds, and soaking seeds through reading newspapers regularly for two years. Now the grain yield per mu has increased from an average of 60 jin in the past to 160 jin. Also, the Zhongya Tobacco Factory Reading Group in Liuzhou, Guangxi, learned the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang group from newspapers, established a shift handover system, a group division of labor responsibility system, a machine maintenance system, and established an economic accounting committee. At the same time, the good work style of the Ma Hengchang group of not keeping technical secrets educated the master Liu Fulin. He took the initiative to challenge the Ma Hengchang group, guaranteeing to teach three apprentices within three months; the apprentices also guaranteed to learn the technology well. The relationship between masters and apprentices in the factory has thus greatly improved.

　　应当重视读报组工作
    杨农安
    据不完全的统计，目前全国共建立了读报组六○三七二个，参加读报组的工人、农民、学生、职员、市民等达六八三八○五人。陕西、绥远二省几乎每个村都建立了读报组。宁夏中卫县二区四乡百分之八十的成年人都参加了读报，平均每十家就有一份报纸，已做到“村村有报，家家读报”。在云南、西康等边疆地区，也普遍建立了读报组。虽然它的发展在各个地区还不是平衡的，但它起了很大作用，已成为一种群众经常学习时事政策的重要组织形式。
            读报组推动了群众工作
    通过读报对群众进行宣传教育，有力地推动了抗美援朝、镇压反革命等工作。如绥远省各地读报组读了美帝国主义在朝鲜的暴行，再结合回忆日寇、美军、蒋匪的罪行，激发了群众对美帝国主义的仇恨；他们纷纷地展开了控诉。中朝人民部队在朝鲜战场上的胜利消息，鼓舞了群众斗争的意志。“多种地，多打粮，支援志愿军！”已成为绥远广大农民群众一致的口号和行动。在读报组带头发动下，仅武东一县的统计，就捐献了粮食五百多石、羊三百只、牛十头及慰问袋四百多个。包头县读报组长代表会议上，还发起捐献“包头人民号”高射炮一门，并讨论出发动群众增产捐献的具体办法。在镇压反革命与取缔反动会道门中，读报组也发挥了很大作用。如绥远武东县堂地厂汗鹉?村经过读报组宣传教育后，报出了十一顷黑地。去年冬天，在农民阶级仇恨的基础上，读报组引导他们积极向地主、恶霸、土匪、特务斗争；农民普遍组织了起来，实行村村联防、户户监督，使土匪、特务无孔可钻。又如在青岛浮山所读报组推动下，全村一百二十人退出一贯道。
            应重视读报组的领导工作
    经验证明，凡领导同志重视读报组的地区，读报组工作就比较搞的好。但是，怎样使干部普遍重视读报组的领导呢？关于这，打通干部思想是一个先决条件。有些干部认为工作很忙，没时间。但各地的事实说明，读报组正是帮助干部推动各项工作的有力武器，正如山东海阳县靠山村支部书记于芳水所说：“报纸是我们村干部的肩膀，利用报纸贯彻工作，比我们干部用嘴讲好的多；照着报纸做，又及时，又深入，又准确，还节省时间。这种办法是再好也没有了。”有些干部认为群众落后，不爱读报；事实恰巧相反，群众很希望了解人民政府的各种政策、时事和生产等知识。在山东海阳县，由于报纸替群众解决了许多实际问题，群众普遍把报纸称为“老师”、和“掌舵的”。他们把读报看成了生活中不可缺少的一部分。还有些干部说：“群众的文化程度低，读报组怕建立不起来。”可是，事实上群众正因为迫切需要文化，才要求参加读报组。另有些干部说：“我们这儿地广人稀，交通又很困难，不能建立读报组。”这也不是理由。例如西康华坪县虽是山区，也建立了读报组。又绥远联合旗，村与村相隔甚至几十里的，也建立了十六个读报组。
            读报组要和宣传网等结合起来
    读报组与宣传网结合以后，宣传员在宣传中“老一套”及“信口开河”的毛病是可以避免的。如浙江嘉善县好多宣传员起初因不注意应用读报的方法，宣传时就发生了困难。他们说：“肚子里没东西，有啥好宣传。”后来采用了读报方法，就使工作顺利地开展起来。而读报组本身也随着宣传网的扩大而扩大。另一方面，读报组如能利用休息时间在工人业余学校、民校或工厂车间进行读报，是不会耽误群众的生产和学习的，一定会受到群众的欢迎。
            内容要切合群众的需要
    读报组除选读重要的时事新闻外，还可以根据群众的需要，选读一些有关生产、卫生常识的文章，以提高群众的兴趣。如河北卢龙县相公庄村读报组，向组员介绍了治猪瘟的办法。山东海阳大山区靠山村荣誉军人于进德，二年来由于经常读报，学会了积尿、积干灰、选种、浸种等方法，现每亩产粮已由过去平均产量六十斤提高到一百六十斤。又广西柳州中亚烟厂读报组从报纸上学习了马恒昌小组的先进经验，建立了交接班制、小组分工负责制、机器保养制，并成立了经济核算委员会。同时，马恒昌小组不保守技术的好作风，教育了师傅刘复林。他主动向马恒昌小组应战，保证三个月内教会三个学徒；学徒也保证学好技术。该厂师徒关系因而大为好转。
