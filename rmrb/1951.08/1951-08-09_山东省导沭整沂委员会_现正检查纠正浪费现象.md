　　Shandong Province Daoshu Zheng Yi Committee
　　Is Currently Inspecting and Correcting Wasteful Phenomena
    Comrade Editor:
    The "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on June 8th published Comrade Lu Qi's criticism of the serious waste phenomenon existing in our committee. After reading this letter of criticism, we immediately convened an enlarged meeting of the Daoshu Zheng Yi Committee on June 29th and conducted a joint study with the original materials clearing team of our committee. We believe that this criticism has given us great education and help. Regarding the matter of waste, we have already conducted a self-criticism. The comrades responsible for leading the work do indeed have guerrilla habits and bureaucratic work styles. Insufficient supervision and inspection of the work led to such a serious waste phenomenon. Now we are continuing to carry out top-down inspections and, in conjunction with this inspection, formulate various systems for cherishing resources. The original materials clearing team has now been determined to make an adjustment and supplement in order to further carry out materials clearing. The specific facts pointed out in the criticism, such as the backlog of funds for purchasing small boats, the purchase of unusable baskets, and the shortage of insulated wire, are all basically true. The person who privately used public funds has been given a suspension from duty and ordered to return the funds within a time limit. The waste of tools such as picks and hoes is still under investigation.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　山东省导沭整沂委员会
　　现正检查纠正浪费现象
    编辑同志：
    六月八日人民日报读者来信栏发表了陆奇同志对我会存在着严重浪费现象的批评。我们读到这封批评信件以后，即于六月二十九日召开了导沐整沂委员会扩大会议并和本会原有的物资清理小组作了共同研究。我们认为这个批评给了我们很大的教育和帮助。对于浪费的事，我们已作了检讨，我们负责领导工作的同志确实存在着游击习气和官僚主义作风。对工作督促检查不够，所以就发生了这样严重的浪费现象。现在我们正继续开展由上而下的检查，并结合这次检查订出各种爱护资财的制度。原有物资清理小组，现已确定作一次调整和补充，以便进一步进行物资清理。批评中所指出的积压购买小船的资金，买了筐子不适用，领回包皮线短了数量等具体事实，基本上全是确实的。私自动用公款的事，已予当事人以停职处分并限期归还。洋镐、镢头等工具的浪费情况，现仍在继续清查中。
          山东省导沭整沂委员会
