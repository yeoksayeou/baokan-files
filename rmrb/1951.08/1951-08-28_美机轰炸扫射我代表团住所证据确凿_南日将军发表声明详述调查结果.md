Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 26th: After a United Nations Command military aircraft intruded into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace at 22:20 on August 22nd, targeting the residence of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation with bombing and strafing, the United Nations Command, in an attempt to obscure the truth and evade responsibility for this serious incident, hastily issued repeated statements, categorically denying this undeniable fact. In order to reveal the truth, General Nam Il, chief delegate of our delegation, issued a statement on August 26th, detailing the preliminary and subsequent investigations into the incident of the United Nations Command military aircraft bombing and strafing our delegation's residence on August 22nd. The following is the full text of General Nam Il's statement:

"At 22:20 on August 22nd, a United Nations Command military aircraft intruded into the Kaesong Neutral Zone, circling the area of our delegation's residence within the conference site for several weeks, diving and dropping multiple bombs, followed by machine-gun strafing, before fleeing.

(1) Report of the on-site investigation conducted by our liaison officers, Colonel Zhang Chunshan and Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen, together with United Nations Command delegation liaison officers, Colonel Kenny and Major Mullery, from 00:25 to 03:15 on August 23rd:

(1) Our side began contacting the United Nations Command delegation via radio telephone at 22:35 on August 22nd. After communicating at 23:00, our side informed the other party's liaison officers of this incident and requested that they immediately send personnel to conduct an on-site investigation together. The other party initially made excuses, claiming it was late at night and refusing to come immediately. After our side's stern and resolute demand, they finally sent their liaison officers, Colonel Kenny and Major Mullery, along with two interpreters, arriving at the conference site at 00:25 on August 23rd to meet with our liaison officers, Colonel Zhang Chunshan and Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen, and begin the joint investigation.

(2) At that time, not all bomb craters had been discovered. The liaison officers first went to inspect a gasoline bomb crater not far northeast of our delegation's residence, and a large piece of gasoline bomb casing that had landed on the highway. Colonel Kenny immediately stated: 'If this counts as a bomb, we have plenty of them,' and expressed his unwillingness to continue the investigation. After our side insisted on its right to investigate and strongly advocated for a detailed investigation, the other party reluctantly agreed to go to inspect the bomb craters near the north of our delegation's residence, where a total of six craters were found, with shell fragments around the craters. However, Colonel Kenny showed impatience after observing each crater and only continued the investigation under our side's insistence. Finally, Colonel Kenny stated again: 'Everything you have asked us to look at today cannot be considered bombs.' Colonel Zhang Chunshan pointed out to the other party that this air raid was an extremely serious incident, with conclusive evidence. What did they have to say? He then lodged a verbal protest with the other party, stating: 'I must point out the extreme seriousness of this incident. I am ordered by our chief delegate to lodge the most serious protest with you verbally, and to inform you that all meetings on the 23rd are suspended. Our side reserves the right to make all demands.' Colonel Kenny replied: 'I will convey your protest to our chief delegate.' The time was 01:40, and the other party's liaison officers left. Shortly after they left, our side received reports from residents and military police in the bombed area, and subsequently discovered two more bomb craters. They then chased after the other party's liaison officers and requested them to return for inspection. Colonel Kenny, using the excuse of late night and rain, refused to return. After our side insisted on continuing the investigation, it took almost half an hour for them to return to the car and inspect the two gasoline bombs that had landed not far southwest of our delegation's residence. Both had obvious craters, one of which showed obvious signs of burning, and the other was unburned, with oil still on the ground. Colonel Kenny then asked if there were any witnesses. Colonel Zhang Chunshan replied: All the residents of Kaesong can testify. The other party then requested to question the responsible personnel among our military police present. The deputy squad leader, Lu Yanzhi, described in detail what he saw when the aircraft dropped the bombs. However, Colonel Kenny then used the excuse that our reporters were present and demanded to terminate the investigation, saying that only when both sides had reporters present could the investigation be resumed. After I refuted that the investigation should not be refused because of such trivial issues, and proactively asked the reporters to withdraw from the area, the other party again used the excuse of insufficient light and suggested coming back to inspect again in the morning. Our side told them that the existing evidence was already conclusive and sufficient, and that there was no need for further inspection, but our side did not refuse your side's re-inspection tomorrow morning, only requiring prior contact via radio telephone. Our side also stated that the rain might wash away some traces. Colonel Kenny replied: 'Steel will not be washed away, and oil will not mix with water.' At this point, the liaison officers of both sides dispersed. The time was 03:15.

(3) After the on-site investigation by the liaison officers of both sides, I reported to Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander, and Peng Dehuai, Commander, that the liaison officers of the United Nations Command delegation would come to continue the investigation the next morning. However, after daybreak on August 23rd, the other party did not send personnel to investigate again.

(4) Regarding the on-site investigation conducted by the liaison officers of both sides from 00:25 to 03:15 on August 23rd, I made the above report to Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai on August 23rd.

(2) Report of the on-site re-inspection conducted by our liaison officers, accompanied by surveyors, journalists, and photographers, from the afternoon of August 23rd to August 26th:

From the afternoon of August 23rd to August 26th, our liaison officers, accompanied by surveyors, journalists, and photographers, conducted a re-inspection of the results of the bombing and strafing of our delegation's residence by the United Nations Command military aircraft on August 22nd. Four gasoline bombs, thirteen fragmentation bombs, and machine gun bullet casings have now been discovered. The situation is as follows:

1. Four gasoline bombs:

(A) One landed approximately 600 meters southwest of our delegation's residence. The burned crater was in a field on a slope, approximately 1.3 meters in diameter and 48 centimeters deep. A large piece of the casing was scattered approximately 15 meters away from the crater. The piece of casing was an irregular semi-ellipse, approximately 60 centimeters wide at the top, 62 centimeters wide at the bottom, and 60 centimeters long. The upper part of the casing was wrinkled into several folds. The writing could be faintly discerned as the first line: INCENDIARY (this word was not completely clear within the wrinkles). Second line: AN-4××3 (two numbers in the number cannot be identified, but the numbers in the corresponding position on the two fragments were 47A3) Third line: MFG1945. Fourth line: REWKD, TAD1950. The grass near the casing was charred, with an irregular area approximately 5 meters long and 2.4 meters wide, with several large and small charred marks nearby.

(B) One landed approximately 30 meters southwest of bomb (A), unburned, with some now-dried oil nearby. The crater was approximately 1.3 meters in diameter and 50 centimeters deep, with a curved iron band and many fragments nearby, as well as a small bell-shaped cap of the projectile. On one fragment, small characters were engraved as follows: First line: LOT1, Second line: 5-45.

(C) One landed approximately 700 meters northeast of our delegation's residence. The bomb landed in crops by the roadside. The crater was approximately 1 meter long, 1.5 meters wide, and 0.5 meters deep. The pit was filled with water due to rain at the time, with oil traces still floating on the water surface. The casing was scattered approximately 4.5 meters away from the crater, landing on the road. Crops, weeds, and rocks nearby were charred. The casing had not been split into two halves. The bottom was shrunken together. No writing could be identified on the casing. There was also a projectile cap resembling a small bell.

(D) One landed approximately 650 meters west-northwest of our delegation's residence. The bomb landed on a slope of a mountain peak, where there were more rocks than grass and trees. The crater was difficult to identify, but there were many charred marks on the rocks and trees. In a large area of charred marks, there was a large piece of the casing, which was also identified with the same writing and markings as bomb (A). The fragment was approximately 78 centimeters long and 56 centimeters wide, with two small protruding parts at the top and bottom. The middle part was roughly square. There was also a piece of casing with engraved writing as follows: First line: HSP6-18. Second line: 5 (slanted) 45. There was also a ruptured detonating cap, approximately 4.5 centimeters long.

2. Thirteen fragmentation bombs all landed approximately 200 meters north of our delegation's residence, all of which had exploded, at very close intervals, ranging from several meters to twenty meters. The situation of their landing is described as follows:

(1) One landed in a field. The crater was approximately 2.2 meters in diameter and 40 centimeters deep. The tail of the bomb remained in the crater. The tail was approximately 15 centimeters long, with a tubular fin pillar in the middle, with four fins attached to the pillar, each fin approximately 5 centimeters wide (the tails of other fragmentation bombs were the same as this, and will not be repeated later).

(2) One landed on the grass on the opposite bank of the mountain. The crater was approximately 1 meter in diameter and 13 centimeters deep, with a bomb tail in the crater.

(3) One landed on a rock close to the ground. There were mottled blast marks on the stone. The largest blast mark was approximately 75 centimeters long and 38 centimeters wide. The soil near the rock was blasted into a roughly semi-circular crater, approximately 2 meters in diameter.

(4) One landed in a small gully with running water. One side of the gully was rock, with scratches on the stone and traces of collapsed soil nearby. There was a bomb tail in the gully.

(5) One landed on the grass next to a mountain rock. A small tree root was overturned. The crater was irregular, approximately 1.5 meters in diameter and 20 centimeters deep, with a bomb tail.

(6) One landed on the grass. A larger tree root was overturned. The crater was approximately 1 meter in diameter and 20 centimeters deep, with a bomb tail.

(7) One landed on the grass near a mountain rock. The crater was approximately 1 meter in diameter and 20 centimeters deep, with a bomb tail.

(8) One landed on a slope of a mountain top. The crater was approximately 1 meter in diameter and 20 centimeters deep, with a bomb tail.

(9) One landed near the top of the mountain. The crater was approximately 1 meter in diameter and 25 centimeters deep, with a bomb tail.

(10) One landed on a slope on the other side of the mountain top. The crater was approximately 1 meter in diameter and 20 centimeters deep.

(11) One landed in a field across from a small gully at the foot of the mountain. The crater was approximately 1.5 meters in diameter and 10 centimeters deep, with a damaged small bomb ring and many fragments nearby.

(12) One landed very close to the previous bomb. The crater was irregular in shape, approximately 3 meters long, 2 meters wide, and 30 centimeters deep, with fragments.

(13) One landed in a field, blasting away a large area of crops. The crater was approximately 1 meter in diameter and 25 centimeters deep, with fragments.

3. Machine gun bullet casings. Regarding the enemy aircraft strafing, one machine gun bullet casing was found on the hillside near the north of our delegation's residence, with the characters WH20MM M21A11945 engraved on the bottom of the casing.

4. The United Nations Command military aircraft bombing and strafing our delegation's residence was not only investigated by our delegation with the above detailed and conclusive evidence, but also witnessed by our military police force in the Kaesong Neutral Zone who were on duty at the time, and can provide eyewitness accounts to prove it. The residents of Kaesong all witnessed or heard about this attack, and can therefore be witnesses of varying degrees to this incident. After the incident on the 22nd, the residents of the Kaesong Neutral Zone built air-raid shelters one after another or moved out. The bombing incident on the 22nd, in fact, changed the face of Kaesong. The residents of Kaesong, regardless of their age, not only witnessed the incident but were also protesters or accusers of the incident. Precisely because almost all the residents of Kaesong are witnesses and can be visited and investigated at any time, it is unnecessary to single out a few specific figures."

　　美机轰炸扫射我代表团住所证据确凿
    南日将军发表声明详述调查结果
    【新华社开城二十六日电】八月二十二日二十二时二十分联合国军军用飞机侵入开城中立区上空，以朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团的住所为目标，施行轰炸与扫射以后，联合国军方面为了蒙蔽事实的真相，企图逃脱此次严重事件的责任，匆忙地一再发表声明，矢口否认这一证据确凿的事实。为了使事实的真相得以大白于天下，我方代表团首席代表南日将军，特于八月二十六日发表声明，详细叙述了八月二十二日联合国军军用飞机轰炸与扫射我代表团住所事件的初查与复查的结果。以下是南日将军声明的全文：
    “八月二十二日二十二时二十分，联合国军军用飞机一架，侵入开城中立区，绕会址区内我代表团住所数周，俯冲投弹多枚，继以机枪扫射，然后逸去。
    （一）八月二十三日零时二十五分至三时十五分，我方联络官张春山上校与柴成文中校，偕同联合国军代表团联络官肯尼上校与穆莱上校实地调查的报告：
    （１）我方于八月二十二日二十二时三十五分即开始用无线电话与联合国军代表团联络，二十三时双方通话后，我方遂将此事件通知对方联络官，并要求对方立即派员前来共同进行实地调查，对方起初托辞夜深，不肯即来，经我方严辞坚决要求后，始派其联络官肯尼上校与穆莱上校携同翻译二名，于二十三日零时二十五分到达会场，与我方联络官张春山上校及柴成文中校相会，开始共同调查。
    （２）当时轰炸痕迹尚未全部发现，双方联络官先赴我代表团住所东北不远处查勘一处汽油弹坑，及爆落公路上之汽油弹壳一大块。肯尼上校当即声称：‘象这样也算炸弹，我们有的是’，并表示不愿继续调查，经我方坚持要求调查之权利，力主详细调查，对方始应允前往我代表团住所以北附近落弹处查勘，共见弹坑六处，弹坑周围遗有弹壳碎片。但肯尼上校在每观察一处弹坑后，均表示不耐烦继续调查，只在我方坚持之下，调查始得以继续。最后肯尼上校又声称：‘你方今天所要我们看的一切都不能算是炸弹。’张春山上校当向对方指出此次空袭是极严重的事件，证据确凿，你方还有何说，继向对方提出口头抗议称：‘我必须指出此次事件的绝大严重性，我奉我方首席代表之命，向你方先在口头上提出最严重的抗议，并通知你：二十三日一切会议停开，我方保留提出一切要求的权利。’肯尼上校答称：‘我将以你方的抗议，转达我方首席代表。’时为一时四十分，对方联络官离去。于他们刚走不久，我方又接获遭受轰炸地点的居民和军事警察的报告，继发现两弹坑，遂上前追及要求对方联络官折返查勘，肯尼上校以夜深天雨为借口，不肯折回，经我方坚持继续调查，几半小时始回车往我代表团住所西南不远处查勘，该处落汽油弹两枚，均有明显弹坑，其一曾燃烧有明显痕迹，另一未燃烧，尚有油液留于地上。肯尼上校于是询问有无人证，张春山上校答称：全体开城居民均能作证，对方遂要求向在场我方军事警察中的负责人员问话，当由副班长鲁延志详细叙述目击当时飞机投弹情形，但肯尼上校却又借口有我方记者在场要求终止调查，并谓必须双方均有记者到场，始能再行调查。经我驳斥不应因此等枝节问题拒绝继续调查，并主动告记者退出该地区后，对方却又托辞光线不足，主张天亮后再来查看，我方告以现有证据已经确凿充分，本可无须再查，但我方并不拒绝你方明晨再来复查，只需先由无线电话联络。我方同时声明，因天雨可能冲去一些痕迹。肯尼上校答称：‘钢铁是不会被冲去的，油也不会与水混合。’至此双方联络官即分散，时为三时十五分。
    （３）我方联络官在双方实地调查之后，曾向我报告联合国军代表团联络官将于次日上午前来继续调查，但八月二十三日天亮以后，对方并未派员再来调查。
    （４）关于双方联络官在八月二十三日零时二十五分至三时十五分的实地调查，我曾在八月二十三日，向金日成最高司令官与彭德怀司令员作如上的报告。
    （二）八月二十三日下午至八月二十六日我方联络官携同测绘员、新闻记者与摄影记者实地复查的报告：
    自八月二十三日下午至八月二十六日我方联络官又携同测绘员、新闻记者及摄影记者对于八月二十二日联合国军军用飞机轰炸与扫射我方代表团住所的结果，进行复查，现已发现汽油弹四枚，杀伤弹十三枚，及机枪子弹弹壳。其情况如下：
    一、汽油弹四枚：
    （甲）一枚落在我代表团住所西南方向，约六百公尺处。已经燃烧弹坑在坡上田中，直径约一点三公尺，深约四十八公分。弹壳一大片，跳离弹坑约十五公尺，该片弹壳为不规则的半椭圆形，上宽约六十公分，下宽约六十二公分，长约六十公分，弹壳上部皱成数折，其字迹依稀可辨为第一排INCENDIARY（此字在皱折之内不完全清楚）。第二排AN—4××3（号码中两字不能辨清，但在两弹弹片上相当地位之号码为47A3）第三排MFG1945。第四排REWKD、TAD1950，弹壳附近草已烧焦，面积并不规则，大致约五公尺长，二点四公尺宽，附近并有大小烧焦痕迹数处。
    （乙）一枚落在离甲弹西南约三十公尺处，未燃烧，附近有若干现在已干的油质，弹坑直径约一点三公尺，深约五十公分，附近有弯曲铁带一条，及碎片甚多，及状似小铃的弹头帽一个，在一碎片上有镌刻小字如下：
    第一排LOT1，第二排5—45。
    （丙）一枚落在我代表团住所东北约七百公尺处，弹落在路旁庄稼中，弹坑约长一公尺，宽一点五公尺，深半公尺，坑内当时因下雨已积水，水面犹浮油迹，弹壳跳离弹坑约四点五公尺，落在路上，附近庄稼野草及岩石均有焦痕，弹壳尚未裂成半片。其底部皱缩在一起，弹壳上辨认不出字迹，另有弹头帽一个状似小铃。
    （丁）一枚落在我代表团住所西偏北约六百五十公尺处，弹落在一山峰的斜坡上，该处岩石多于草树，弹坑不易辨识。但岩石上及草树有焦痕多处，在一大片焦痕中，有弹片一大块，又辨出与甲弹相同的字迹与标志，该弹片直约七十八公分，阔五十六公分，上下有两小部分突出，中部大致为方形。另有弹壳一片上有镌刻字迹如下：第一排HSP6—18。第二排5（斜刻）45。另有一已破裂的引火帽，长约四点五公分。
    二、杀伤弹十三枚均落在我代表团住所北约二百公尺一带，各弹均已爆炸，相距甚近，自数公尺至二十公尺不等。其落弹处情况分述如后：
    （１）落在田内弹坑直径约二点二公尺，深四十公分，坑内遗有弹尾，弹尾全长约十五公分，中为管状翅柱，柱上附有四翅，每翅宽约五公分（其他杀伤弹弹尾均同此，以后不另复述）。
    （２）落在山对岸草地上弹坑直径约一公尺，深约十三公分，坑内有一弹尾。
    （３）落在靠近地面的岩石上，石上炸痕斑斑，最大一块炸痕约长七十五公分，阔三十八公分，近岩石处泥土炸成一大致半圆形的弹坑，直径约二公尺。
    （４）落在有流水的小沟中，沟一边为岩石，石上有创痕，附近有泥土下崩痕迹，沟中有弹尾。
    （５）落在紧靠山岩的草地上有一小树根被翻起，弹坑不规则，直径约一点五公尺，深约二十公分，有弹尾。
    （６）落在草地上有一较大树根被翻起，弹坑直径约一公尺，深约二十公分，有弹尾。
    （７）落在山岩附近草地上，弹坑直径约一公尺，深约二十公分，有弹尾。
    （８）落在山头斜坡上，弹坑直径约一公尺，深约二十公分，有弹尾。
    （９）落在靠近山顶处，弹坑直径约一公尺，深约二十五公分，有弹尾。
    （１０）落在山头另一面斜坡上弹坑直径约一公尺，深约二十公分。
    （１１）落在山下小沟对面田内，弹坑直径约一点五公尺，深约十公分，附近有一破损小弹圈，碎弹片甚多。
    （１２）落在距离上弹极近处弹坑形不规则约长三公尺，阔二公尺，深约三十公分，有碎弹片。
    （１３）落在田内，炸去田内作物一大片，弹坑直径约一公尺，深约二十五公分，有碎弹片。
    三、机枪枪弹弹壳。关于敌机扫射，在我代表团住所北面附近山坡上，捡有机枪子弹弹壳一枚，弹壳底部镌刻有WH20MM M21A11945字样。
    四、联合国军军用飞机以我代表团住所为目标进行轰炸扫射一事，不仅我代表团调查有上述详细确实证据，当时正在执行任务的开城中立区我方军事警察部队，均能提供目击经过以为证明，开城居民无不目击或耳闻此一袭击事实，从而都可为此次事件不同程度的见证者。二十二日事件的发生以后，开城中立区居民纷纷修建防空洞，或向外迁移。二十二日轰炸事件，事实上改变了开城市的面貌，开城市的居民不管老弱妇孺，不仅是此次事件的见证者而且还是对于此次事件的抗议者，或控诉者，唯其因为开城市居民几乎人人都是见证者，随时可以去访问和调查，举出少数的具体人物，倒反是不必要了。”
