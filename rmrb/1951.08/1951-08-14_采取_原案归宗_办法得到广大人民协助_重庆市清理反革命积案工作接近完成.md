Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 13th: The Chongqing Municipal People's Government has adopted the method of "returning cases to their origin" in its work of clearing up counter-revolutionary backlog cases. As of the 7th of this month, 95% of all backlog cases have been concluded, and 70% have been processed.

The method of "returning cases to their origin" involves submitting the criminal materials of counter-revolutionary elements to the people in their respective residential areas for discussion and suggestions for handling, followed by a judgment by the People's Government. In the first half of July, the Municipal People's Procuratorate submitted the criminal materials of 595 counter-revolutionary criminals to the people in various districts for discussion. All districts in the city held representative conferences of people from all walks of life, consultative committees, and enlarged conferences of people's representatives. The 8,828 representatives attending the meetings conscientiously and responsibly discussed the sentencing of these counter-revolutionary elements. Among them, 23 were sentenced to death, 42 were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve and forced labor to observe their future behavior, 466 were sentenced to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment, and 64 were released on bail for supervision. Subsequently, the Municipal People's Procuratorate cleared up a large number of counter-revolutionary cases. In order to further mobilize the masses of the people to participate in the clearing work, these cases were submitted to the citizens of various streets and sections for discussion. From July 23rd to August 7th, the First District alone held 26 residents' representative meetings, based on public security police stations, to discuss the sentencing of 395 counter-revolutionary criminals. Before the residents' representative meetings were held, the District People's Government printed and distributed the criminal materials of these counter-revolutionary criminals and the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries to the broad masses of citizens, and discussions were launched based on household registration groups. Then, based on household registration sections, five to eight representatives were selected to attend the residents' representative meetings at the public security police stations to put forward opinions on handling these counter-revolutionary elements. The Municipal Counter-Revolutionary Backlog Case Handling Committee concentrated the opinions of the broad masses of citizens, conducted careful research, and then made judgments.

With the active assistance of the broad masses of citizens, the Municipal People's Government has handled counter-revolutionary cases cautiously and accurately. For example, after discussion by the people in various districts, the sentences of 4% of the first batch of 595 counter-revolutionary elements were changed after supplementary materials were added. The sentences of 31 of the 395 counter-revolutionary elements discussed by the people in the First District were also changed after supplementary materials were added through discussion. For example, Huang Dingguo, a Kuomintang "Military Command" secret agent, was originally intended to be sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment; however, after the masses discussed and added supplementary materials, it was discovered that he had raped a 12-year-old girl to death, and his sentence was changed to death with a two-year reprieve and forced labor to observe his future behavior.

The broad masses of citizens were very satisfied with the handling of these counter-revolutionary elements, saying that the People's Government was as clear as a mirror and as clean as water, and truly achieved not letting anyone be wrongly convicted or letting anyone escape justice. In some places, when discussing the sentencing of counter-revolutionary elements, some family members of counter-revolutionary elements were also invited to participate. They were educated at the meetings. For example, Liu Derong, a family member of a counter-revolutionary element, said: "I reported my secret agent husband, and the People's Government even allowed me to participate in the discussion when handling his case. I have a deeper understanding of the boundary between counter-revolutionaries and the people. I am the people, and he (referring to her husband) is a counter-revolutionary, so I should exercise dictatorship over him!"

Chongqing City's work of clearing up counter-revolutionary backlog cases is being carried out under the unified leadership of the Municipal Counter-Revolutionary Backlog Case Handling Committee. Since the beginning of July, the Municipal Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government have unified leadership, and the Municipal People's Procuratorate, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal People's Court have established a counter-revolutionary backlog case handling committee, and sub-committees have been established in all eight districts of the city. All democratic parties and various organs and organizations have also drawn 468 cadres to participate in this work. They are divided into more than 30 groups, responsible for reviewing, investigation and research, etc. The Counter-Revolutionary Backlog Case Handling Committee gradually accumulated experience in the process of its work, and then universally adopted the method of "returning cases to their origin," thus obtaining the assistance of the broad masses of citizens and enabling the work to unfold rapidly.

　　采取“原案归宗”办法得到广大人民协助
    重庆市清理反革命积案工作接近完成
    【新华社重庆十三日电】重庆市人民政府在清理反革命积案工作中采取“原案归宗”的办法，截至本月七日为止，全部积案已有百分之九十五结案，并有百分之七十已处理完毕。
    “原案归宗”的办法，即是将反革命分子的罪行材料交由其所住地区人民讨论，提出处理意见，然后由人民政府判决。七月上半月，市人民检察署就曾将五百九十五个反革命罪犯的罪行材料交给各区人民讨论。全市各区都先后举行了各界人民代表会议协商委员会和各界人民代表扩大会议。出席会议的八千八百二十八位代表，都认真负责地讨论了对这批反革命分子的处刑问题。其中，二十三名判处死刑，四十二名判处死刑、缓期两年、强迫劳动、以观后效，四百六十六名分别判处无期徒刑或有期徒刑，六十四名判决取保释放后予以管制。接着，市人民检察署又清理出大批反革命案件，为了进一步发动人民群众参加清理工作，这批案件就交由各街、段市民进行讨论。从七月二十三日到八月七日止，仅第一区即以公安派出所为单位，举行了二十六次居民代表会议，对三百九十五名反革命罪犯的处刑问题进行了讨论。在召开居民代表会议之前，区人民政府即将这些反革命罪犯的罪行材料和中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例印发给广大市民，以户籍小组为单位展开讨论。然后以户籍段为单位，推选五个至八个代表赴公安派出所参加居民代表会议，提出处理这批反革命分子的意见。市反革命积案处理委员会集中广大市民的意见，加以缜密研究后，才作出判决。
    在广大市民积极协助下，市人民政府对反革命案件的处理做到了慎重和准确。如首批的五百九十五名反革命分子，经各区人民讨论后，有百分之四经补充材料改刑。第一区人民讨论的三百九十五名反革命分子，也有三十一名经讨论补充材料后改刑。如对国民党“军统”特务分子黄定国，原拟判有期徒刑十五年；后经群众讨论补充材料，发现其曾强奸十二岁幼女致死，便改处死刑、缓期两年、强迫劳动、以观后效。
    广大市民对这些反革命分子的处理感到十分满意，都说人民政府办事明如镜，清如水，真正做到了毋枉毋纵。有的地方在讨论对反革命分子的处刑时，还吸收了一部分反革命分子家属参加。他们在会上受到了教育。如反革命分子家属刘德荣说：“我检举了我的特务丈夫，人民政府处理他时还让我参加讨论，我更体会了反革命和人民的界线。我是人民，他（指她的丈夫）是反革命，我就应该对他专政！”
    重庆市的清理反革命积案工作，是在市反革命积案处理委员会统一领导下进行的。自七月初开始，市军事管制委员会与市人民政府统一领导，由市人民检察署、市公安局、市人民法院等成立了反革命积案处理委员会，全市八个区并成立了分会。各民主党派及各机关、团体也抽出四百六十八名干部参加这一工作，他们分成三十多个小组，分别负责审理、调查研究等。反革命积案处理委员会在工作过程中逐渐积累经验，才普遍采用了“原案归宗”的处理办法，因而取得广大市民群众的协助，使工作迅速展开。
