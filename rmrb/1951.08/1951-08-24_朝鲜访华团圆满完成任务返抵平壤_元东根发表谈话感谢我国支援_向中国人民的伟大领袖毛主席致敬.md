Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 23rd: The entire Korean People's Delegation to China, led by head of the delegation Won Dong-geun and deputy head Kim In-chun, successfully completed their mission of visiting the Chinese people and returned here a few days ago.

On August 22nd, delegation head Won Dong-geun made the following remarks to our agency reporter regarding his impressions of visiting China:

The purpose of our delegation's visit to the People's China was to express the deep gratitude of the Korean people to the great Chinese people, who, under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong, have raised the righteous banner of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and are using their blood to aid us. At the same time, we wanted to introduce to the Chinese people the heroic deeds of the Korean people and the Chinese and Korean forces in the common struggle against aggression, in order to further strengthen the friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Korea.

During our delegation's one and a half month stay in China, we visited Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin and other places, and were warmly welcomed everywhere by the Chinese democratic parties, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life, led by the Chinese Communist Party. They welcomed our delegation as if they were welcoming their own brothers returning from the front.

During the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, our delegation, on behalf of the thirty million Korean people, presented a banner, paid respects, and expressed gratitude to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. This was the greatest honor for all comrades of our delegation.

After visiting the great New China, we are even more confident that the Fatherland Liberation War will surely be victorious. We have personally witnessed the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, which has penetrated every corner of China, as well as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement and the land reform movement, which are closely integrated with this movement, and the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in the struggle to revive and develop their motherland's democratic construction.

What impressed us most was the vivid fact that the entire Chinese people are widely carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement with concrete patriotic covenants: workers are increasing production, farmers are increasing yields, and the industrial and commercial circles are increasing their income through expanding their business, all with the purpose of enthusiastically donating airplanes and cannons. All of this is being carried out under a unified goal. The Chinese people continue to volunteer to come to the Korean battlefield, and they regard this as the most glorious thing.

The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement is by no means just a slogan, but a great practical movement initiated by the entire Chinese people from the bottom of their hearts.

We visited many cities and villages in New China and talked with the broad masses of the people. Regardless of gender or age, they all said in unison: "The suffering of the Korean people is our suffering, and the victory of the Korean people is our victory." How kind and touching.

The political consciousness of the Chinese people is so high, and they are united around the great Chairman Mao Zedong like steel.

With 475 million great Chinese people as our backing, and with the active support of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, is there any doubt about our final victory?

Overcoming all difficulties and striving for the final victory of the righteous struggle in order to repay our close friends is our responsibility.

In summary, after this visit to the People's China, we deeply feel that the close friendship and unity that our two peoples, China and Korea, forged with blood in the past in the common struggle against Japanese imperialism has become even more consolidated today in the common struggle against the armed aggression of American imperialism to defend peace in the Far East, and that this close friendship and unity has become an important guarantee for our victory.

Finally, on behalf of all the comrades of the Korean People's Delegation to China, I would like to extend our lofty respect to the entire Chinese people and their great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, and our deep gratitude to the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea for the many conveniences and profound friendship they extended to us during our visit to China.

　　朝鲜访华团圆满完成任务返抵平壤
    元东根发表谈话感谢我国支援
    向中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席致敬
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】朝鲜人民访华代表团全体团员在团长元东根、副团长金仁春的率领下，圆满地完成了访问中国人民的任务，已于日前返抵此间。
    代表团团长元东根于二十二日对本社记者发表访华感想如下：
    我们代表团此次访问人民中国的目的，是要向在伟大的毛泽东主席领导下、高举抗美援朝保家卫国的正义旗帜、用鲜血援助我们的伟大的中国人民，表达朝鲜人民的深切感谢；同时向中国人民介绍朝鲜人民和中朝部队在反侵略的共同斗争中的英勇事迹，以进一步加强中朝两国人民的友谊团结。
    我们代表团在中国滞留的一个半月期间，访问了北京、天津、南京、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨等地，到处受到以中国共产党为首的中国各民主党派、人民团体和各界人士的热烈欢迎。他们欢迎我们代表团就象欢迎从前线回来的自己亲兄弟一样。
    在庆祝中国共产党诞生三十周年时，我们代表团曾代表三千万朝鲜人民，向中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席献旗、致敬、致谢。这是我们代表团全体同志最大的光荣。
    访问了伟大的新中国之后，我们更加强了祖国解放战争一定要胜利的信心。我们亲眼看到了中国人民在深入到全中国每一个角落里的抗美援朝运动，及与这一运动密切结合的镇压反革命运动和土地改革运动中所取得的伟大成果，和中国人民在复兴与发展自己祖国的民主建设斗争中所取得的辉煌成绩。
    特别给我们以深刻印象的是全中国人民正以具体的爱国公约来广泛地开展抗美援朝运动的种种生动的事实，工人以增加生产，农民以增加收获量，工商业界以扩展业务的实际行动来增加收入，用以踊跃捐献飞机大炮，而这一切都是在一致的目标下进行的。中国人民正继续志愿到朝鲜战场上来，他们以此为最光荣的事情。
    抗美援朝运动绝不仅是一个口号，而是全中国人民衷心发起的伟大的实践运动。
    我们访问了新中国的许多城市和乡村，与广大的人民谈过话，他们不分男女老幼，都异口同声地说：“朝鲜人民的痛苦就是我们的痛苦，朝鲜人民的胜利就是我们的胜利。”这多么亲切、多么感人。
    中国人民的政治觉悟是如此的高，他们就象钢铁一般地团结在伟大的毛泽东主席的周围。
    有了四亿七千五百万伟大的中国人民做我们的后盾，有了苏联和各人民民主国家对我们的积极支援，难道我们的最后胜利还有丝毫疑问吗？
    克服一切困难，争取正义斗争的最后胜利，以答谢我们亲密的朋友们，这就是我们的责任。
    总起来说：我们此次访问了人民中国之后，深切地感到：我们朝中两国人民过去在反对日本帝国主义的共同斗争中用鲜血结成的亲密友谊团结，在今天反对美国帝国主义武装侵略保卫远东和平的共同斗争中，更加巩固起来了，而且这种亲密的友谊团结业已成为我们胜利的重要保障了。
    最后，我代表朝鲜人民访华代表团全体同志，谨向全中国人民及其伟大的领袖毛泽东主席致以崇高的敬意，向在我们访华期间给予我们诸多便利与隆情厚谊的中国人民抗美援朝总会致以深切的感谢。
