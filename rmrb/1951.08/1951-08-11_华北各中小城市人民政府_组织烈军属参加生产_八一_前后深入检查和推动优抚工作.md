Xinhua News Agency, August 8th—People's governments in small and medium-sized cities in North China are actively organizing families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers to participate in production, introducing them to jobs, and launching mass preferential treatment campaigns to improve the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers.

　　In January and February, Zhangjiakou City organized more than 1,900 families of martyrs and soldiers to participate in production in brick and tile kilns, paper pasting factories, and cloth shoe processing factories, solving the livelihood difficulties of 80% of the families of martyrs and soldiers in the city. In mid-March, Gui Sui City established a military family burlap bag factory, absorbing more than 240 people to participate in production. In addition, it organized all families of martyrs and soldiers into 113 production groups according to streets and alleys, engaging in dismantling, washing, sewing, and other work. Currently, most of the more than 1,800 families of martyrs and soldiers in the city have been employed in production. The Civil Affairs Bureau and the Labor Bureau of the Tangshan Municipal People's Government have introduced more than 540 families of martyrs and soldiers to major factories and mines such as Qixin, Huaxin, Kailuan, Steelmaking, and Desheng to participate in production.

　　After participating in production, the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the families of martyrs and soldiers have generally improved, and many labor models have emerged. They have also motivated families of martyrs and soldiers who did not love labor and relied solely on subsidies to participate in production. Zhangjiakou City recently held a labor model award meeting attended by more than 1,800 families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers, and selected 54 labor models from among the families of martyrs and soldiers.

　　The people of all cities warmly responded to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America, Aid Korea to do a good job in preferential treatment, and launched a mass social mutual assistance preferential treatment campaign. For example, when recruiting employees, public and private factories and shops in Shijiazhuang give priority to employing families of martyrs and soldiers. When families of martyrs and soldiers buy goods, they can receive preferential price reductions with their family certificates. All Chinese and Western hospitals provide free medical treatment to poor families of martyrs and soldiers, and reduce or waive medicine fees. Fengzhen, Suiyuan Province, is actively preparing to organize production cooperatives for poor families of martyrs and soldiers. The Pharmaceutical Federation has issued 500 free medical certificates to families of martyrs and soldiers and guarantees careful medical treatment and good medicine. Many urban industrial and commercial circles and medical circles have formulated specific measures to treat families of martyrs and soldiers preferentially and have incorporated these measures into patriotic covenants.

　　People from all walks of life in Tianjin are now enthusiastically launching a mass preferential treatment campaign. The Tianjin Municipal Preferential Treatment Work Inspection and Promotion Committee and its branches were established in the city and various districts in the latter half of last month, responsible for going deep into the streets and neighborhoods of various districts to inspect and promote preferential treatment work. The Resist America, Aid Korea branches and sub-branches of people's organizations, factories, agencies, and schools in Tianjin held discussion meetings around "August 1st" to review preferential treatment work and formulate improvement measures for the future. Citizens in various districts voluntarily organized preferential treatment groups to assist the people's government in solving difficulties for families of martyrs and soldiers. The Fourth District alone established 400 preferential treatment groups to repair leaky houses and wash clothes for families of martyrs and soldiers. All state-owned and public trade departments have decided to give priority to employing families of martyrs and soldiers when recruiting employees. Some industrialists and businessmen have also formulated preferential treatment work plans, deciding to help families of martyrs and soldiers find jobs and give preferential treatment when families of martyrs and soldiers purchase goods. They have also decided to raise funds to help families of martyrs and soldiers solve difficulties in life and production.

　　华北各中小城市人民政府
    组织烈军属参加生产
   “八一”前后深入检查和推动优抚工作
    【新华社八日讯】华北区中小城市人民政府积极组织革命烈士家属、革命军人家属参加生产，介绍职业，并开展了群众性的优抚运动，使烈属、军属生活得到改善。
    张家口市在一、二月间曾组织了一千九百多名烈属、军属参加砖瓦窑、格褙工厂、便鞋加工工厂等生产，解决了全市百分之八十烈属、军属的生活困难。归绥市于三月中旬成立军属麻袋厂，吸收二百四十多人参加生产，另外又按街巷把所有烈属、军属编成一百一十三个生产小组，从事拆洗缝补等工作。现全市一千八百多户烈属、军属已大部就业生产。唐山市人民政府民政局与劳动局已介绍烈属、军属五百四十多人到启新、华新、开滦、制钢、德盛等各大厂矿参加生产。
    烈属、军属参加生产后，政治觉悟与生产积极性普遍提高，涌现出许多劳动模范，他们并带动不爱劳动，单靠补助粮生活的烈属、军属也参加了生产。张家口市日前召开了有一千八百多位烈属、军属、革命残废军人参加的奖励劳动模范大会，评选出五十四名烈属、军属劳动模范。
    各城市人民热烈响应了中国人民抗美援朝总会作好优抚工作的号召，展开了群众性的社会互助优抚运动。如石家庄市各公私营工厂、商店提出招收职工时，尽先录用烈属、军属；烈属、军属买货，凭家属证可受减价优待。各中西医院都对贫苦烈属、军属实行免费诊疗，并减免药费。绥远省丰镇正积极筹备组织贫苦烈属、军属生产合作社。医药联合会已发给烈属、军属五百份免费医疗证，并保证看病细心，用好药。许多城市工商界、医药界都订出了优待烈属、军属的具体办法，并把这办法订入爱国公约。
    天津市各界人民现正热烈展开群众性的优抚运动。该市及各区上月下旬分别成立了天津市优抚工作检查推动委员会及各区分会，负责深入各区街道中去检查和推动优抚工作。天津市各人民团体、工厂、机关、学校的抗美援朝支会、支分会，都于“八一”前后举行座谈会，检查优抚工作，并订出今后改进办法。各区市民自动组织优抚小组，协助人民政府为烈属、军属解决困难。仅第四区即成立了四百个优抚小组，为烈属、军属修补漏屋和洗衣服。各国营公营贸易部门均决定于招收职员时尽先录用烈属、军属。部分工商业者也制订了优抚工作计划。决定帮助烈属、军属介绍职业，烈属、军属购物时予以优待。他们并决定募捐帮助烈属、军属解决生活与生产的困难等。
