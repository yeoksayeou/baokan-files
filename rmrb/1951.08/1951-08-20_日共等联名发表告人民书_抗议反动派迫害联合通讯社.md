　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: Tokyo delayed news: The Japanese Communist Party, the Labor-Peasant Party, the All-round Peace Patriotic Movement Council, the Japan Newspaper Association, and more than 20 progressive organizations including teachers, metal workers, chemical workers, and printing and publishing workers' unions, jointly issued an appeal to the people on July 13, protesting against the reactionary forces' illegal order to the United News Agency to stop sending稿件. The appeal stated that the reactionary forces' persecution of the United News Agency is a fascist suppression of democratic speech. The appeal said that the United News Agency has reported to the world the true situation of the Japanese working masses and good people who are fighting day and night to oppose war and defend peace. Therefore, the suppression of the United News Agency is not just a problem of one news agency, but a direct act of strangling the entire labor movement. At the same time, this also completely violates the freedom of speech guaranteed by the Potsdam Declaration and the Japanese Constitution.
    The communique finally expressed a serious protest to the Yoshida government and demanded that all effective measures be taken immediately to revoke the ban on the United News Agency from sending稿件.

　　日共等联名发表告人民书  抗议反动派迫害联合通讯社
    【新华社十七日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党、劳农党、全面媾和爱国运动协议会、日本机关报协会以及教职员、金属工人、化学工人、印刷出版工人工会等二十多个进步组织，曾在七月十三日联名发表告人民书，抗议反动派非法迫令联合通讯社停止发稿。告人民书指出：反动派对联合通讯社的迫害，是法西斯分子对民主言论的镇压。告人民书说：联合通讯社曾向全世界报道日本劳苦大众和善良的人民为反对战争、保卫和平而日夜奋斗的真实情况。所以，对联合通讯社的镇压，并非仅是一个通讯社的问题，而是直接对整个劳工运动的绞杀行为。同时，这也完全破坏了波茨坦宣言和日本宪法所保障的言论自由。
    该文告最后表示向吉田政府提出严重抗议，并要求立即采取一切有效措施，撤销停止联合通讯社发稿的禁令。
