　　Resolutely Implement the Marriage Law
    Shanghai Jiefang Daily Editorial
    The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China promulgated by the Central People's Government is a major law for abolishing the feudal marriage system and establishing a new democratic marriage system. It is the fruit of the victory of the struggle of the broad masses of the Chinese people, and a firm guarantee for the realization of equality between men and women and freedom of marriage. It concerns the happiness of the people of the whole country and future generations. Taking effective measures to resolutely and correctly implement this solemn and significant national law is the common responsibility of governments at all levels and people's organizations.
    The East China Military and Political Committee's issuance of instructions on implementing the Marriage Law is very important and timely. At present, land reform in East China has been largely completed, people's living standards have been initially improved, and the level of awareness has been significantly raised. Under these new circumstances, the vast number of young men and women urgently demand marital autonomy, and therefore the number of marriage cases accepted by local judicial organs is constantly increasing. According to statistics from Jiaozhou Prefecture in Shandong, marriage cases account for 90 percent of all civil cases; in other regions, marriage cases also account for the majority of civil cases. This shows how urgent the demand for democracy and freedom in male-female relationships and family relationships is among the broad masses of the people, especially women who have suffered from the old marriage system, with the changes in social economy, culture, life, and thought. Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, although it has had a positive impact on the masses in various parts of East China, many counties and districts have not yet had time to make systematic arrangements for the implementation of the Marriage Law in the past year, and serious unfortunate incidents of women committing suicide and being killed due to marital relations still occur. From January to October 1950, there were 1,200 documented cases of women committing suicide and being killed due to marriage problems in Shandong Province. In the nine counties of Huaiyin Prefecture in northern Jiangsu, statistics from May to August 1950 show that 119 women were forced to commit suicide or were beaten to death due to marital relations. In Xin'an District of Liu'an County, northern Anhui, four women were beaten to death in six days due to marital disputes. Such a serious phenomenon must be paid attention to. There are also many marriages that are voluntary on both sides but are not allowed by the family and are subject to unreasonable interference by third parties; there are also many women who suffer abuse and oppression and demand a divorce but cannot obtain a divorce. "If this dark and decadent feudal marriage system is not completely eliminated, and if the family slavery of women is not overthrown, then the slogan of equality between men and women and the democratic and free social life cannot be realized, and the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of women cannot be developed" (see the People's Daily editorial on May 1, 1950). Under these circumstances, it is entirely correct and necessary to propose the implementation of the Marriage Law at the right time.
    Some people do not see the arduousness and necessity of abolishing the feudal ideas and bad habits remaining from the feudal society that has existed in China for thousands of years, and adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards the implementation of the Marriage Law, which is wrong. It should be noted that the implementation of the Marriage Law, the abolition of the feudal marriage system, and the establishment of a new and rational marriage system are one of the important tasks of the entire anti-feudal revolutionary struggle, and are one of the construction tasks of building a new democratic society in terms of people's ideology, social customs, and national system. If this task is not striven for implementation, not only will the Marriage Law itself be difficult to implement correctly, but also the work of comprehensively and deeply mobilizing the masses and universally improving the production enthusiasm of the masses will be severely restricted, and the establishment and consolidation of the normal order of the new society will be hindered.
    Some people do not study the Marriage Law, do not understand the positive significance of the Marriage Law, and simply and blindly regard the Marriage Law as a divorce law, thinking that if the Marriage Law is implemented, many people will want to divorce, which will disrupt social order, so they dare not publicize the Marriage Law among the masses, or even prevent the publicity of the Marriage Law, which is completely wrong. The Marriage Law is not a divorce law; it includes both freedom of marriage and freedom of divorce. Under the feudal arranged and mercenary marriage system, many "unhappy couples" have been created; many women suffer slavery and abuse, are distressed and pessimistic, and attempt suicide. Such marriages are not afraid of divorce, but should be divorced; such divorce is only a special behavior of some men and women after marriage when they have no other choice. The Marriage Law not only guarantees freedom of marriage, but also guarantees "unhappy couples" the freedom to divorce, because the existence of unreasonable marriages is the root cause of the chaotic phenomena of male-female relations in society. Only when the spirit and content of the Marriage Law, like other national laws, are made known to every household and known to both young and old, can the Marriage Law be smoothly realized. Local experience proves that in places where the Marriage Law is boldly and deeply publicized, it is easier to achieve good results in the implementation of the Marriage Law.
    There are also some people who know that the spirit of the Marriage Law is to abolish the feudal marriage system and establish a new democratic marriage system, but when it involves themselves or people related to them, they distort the Marriage Law and deliberately take a sentence out of context in order to achieve their personal goals; or due to the influence of the exploitative class consciousness of the old society, they do not take a cautious, correct, and serious attitude towards marriage issues, resulting in many unnecessary divorce disputes, and even causing some unfortunate events. Therefore, the organs and cadres responsible for handling marriage disputes should, based on the spirit of the Marriage Law, distinguish between different situations and make different treatments. For divorce cases that were originally feudal oppressive marriages, divorce should be granted at the discretion of the actual situation; for those incorrect divorce cases, they should be given serious education on consolidating marital relations and necessary mediation should be conducted to ensure the correct implementation of the Marriage Law. Only in this way can new marriage concepts for men and women in the new society be cultivated and happy and united families be established.
    At the same time, the Marriage Law should not only be deeply publicized and educated among the masses in a planned way, but also meticulously studied and learned by cadres in a planned way, so that they can understand the spirit of the Marriage Law and work hard for the implementation of the Marriage Law by setting an example. Especially among rural grassroots cadres, their feudal ideas on male-female relations are still very serious. Some believe that women who file for divorce are immoral and dishonest, so they forcibly suppress them and do not make fair treatment; some treat women as property, and do not allow women to divorce even if they are abused. If they want to divorce, they have to give the man food or money, saying that this is so as not to "lose both people and money"; some older township chiefs, township party branch secretaries, or farmers' association chairmen lead the masses to carry out anti-feudal struggles against the landlord class on the one hand, but on the other hand, they themselves adopt child brides, or marry older women for their young sons. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the education of grassroots cadres. Individuals cadre that dare to violate the Marriage Law and interfere with the freedom of marriage between men and women, thereby causing injury or death to the interfered person, should be resolutely punished according to law. Only in this way can the Marriage Law be truly implemented among the masses.
    The Marriage Law was born with the liberation of the Chinese people. As the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China said in its notice to the whole party: "The correct implementation of the Marriage Law will not only liberate the Chinese men and women - especially the women - from the barbaric and backward old marriage system for thousands of years, but also establish a new marriage system, new family relations, new social life and new social morality, in order to promote the development of the political construction, economic construction, cultural construction and national defense construction of the new democratic China." However, the formulation and promulgation of the Marriage Law is only the beginning of the solution of the problem, and does not mean the death of the old marriage system. Resolutely, conscientiously, and correctly implementing the Marriage Law is the common task of governments at all levels, people's organizations, and the broad masses of the people.

　　坚决贯彻执行婚姻法
    上海解放日报社论
    中央人民政府颁布的中华人民共和国婚姻法是废除封建婚姻制度与建立新民主主义婚姻制度的大法。它是中国广大人民斗争胜利的果实，是实现男女平等婚姻自由的坚强保证。它关系着全国人民和后代的幸福。对这个严肃而意义重大的国家大法，采取有效办法，坚决正确地贯彻执行，是各级人民政府和各人民团体的共同责任。
    华东军政委员会发出关于贯彻执行婚姻法的指示，是非常重要和切合时宜的。现华东土地改革已大部完成，人民生活有了初步改善，觉悟程度已有显著提高。在这种新的情况下，广大男女青年迫切要求婚姻自主，因此各地司法机关受理的婚姻案件不断增多。据山东胶州专区的统计，婚姻案件占全部民事案件的百分之九十；其他各地民事案件中也均以婚姻案件占大多数。这可以看出，随着社会经济、文化、生活、思想的变化，广大人民，特别是受尽旧婚姻制度迫害的妇女，在男女关系上和家庭关系上要求民主自由是何等的迫切。华东各地自婚姻法颁布后，虽然在群众中已产生了良好的影响，但由于一年来各地对婚姻法的贯彻执行还来不及作系统的布置，不少县区仍有妇女因婚姻关系而自杀和被杀的严重不幸事件发生。山东全省从一九五○年一月至十月，有案可查的因婚姻问题自杀和被杀的妇女达一千二百名。苏北淮阴专区九个县一九五○年五月到八月的统计，因婚姻关系被迫自杀和被打死的妇女有一百十九人。皖北六安县新安区，六天中因婚姻纠纷，打死了四个妇女。这样严重的现象，是必须引起注意的。还有许多男女双方自愿的婚姻，却得不到家庭允许，而遭受到第三者无理干涉；也有许多妇女身受虐待压迫要求离婚而得不到离婚的。“这种黑暗腐朽的封建主义婚姻制度，如不彻底消除，对妇女的家庭奴隶制如不推翻，则男女平等的口号和民主自由的社会生活是不可能实现的，广大妇女的劳动积极性的发扬也是不可能实现的”（见一九五○年五月一日人民日报社论）。在这种情况下，适时的提出贯彻执行婚姻法，是完全正确和必要的。
    有些人看不见废除中国几千年来封建社会残存下来的封建思想和恶习的艰巨性和必要性，对婚姻法的执行采取自流态度，这是错误的。须知实行婚姻法，废除封建婚姻制度，建立新的合理的婚姻制度，这是整个反封建革命斗争重要任务之一，是从人民思想上、社会风俗上及国家制度上建设新民主主义社会的建设任务之一。对于这个任务如不力求贯彻，则不但婚姻法本身难于正确实行，而且使全面深入发动群众与普遍提高群众生产积极性的工作受到严重的限制，并妨碍新社会正常秩序的建立和巩固。
    有些人不研究婚姻法，不了解婚姻法的积极意义，简单盲目地把婚姻法看成离婚法，以为实行婚姻法，许多人都会要离婚，将搞乱社会秩序，因此不敢在群众中宣传婚姻法，或竟阻止婚姻法的宣传，这是完全错误的。婚姻法并非离婚法，它包括结婚自由与离婚自由的两方面。在封建的包办买卖婚姻制度之下，造成了许多的“怨偶”；许多妇女受着奴役虐待，苦恼悲观，企图自杀，像这样的婚姻，不是怕离，而是应该离；这种离婚只是一部分男女婚后不得已的特殊行为。婚姻法既保障结婚自由，同时又保障“怨偶”有离婚的自由，因为不合理婚姻的存在，正是产生社会上男女关系混乱现象的根源。只有把婚姻法的精神和内容如其它国家大法一样，做到了家喻户晓、老少皆知，婚姻法才能顺利的实现。各地经验证明，凡是大胆深入宣传婚姻法的地方，对执行婚姻法就更容易取得良好的成绩。
    又有一些人明知婚姻法的精神是废除封建婚姻制度，建立新民主主义婚姻制度，但是牵涉到自己或与自己有关系的人的时候，就曲解婚姻法，故意断章取义以求遂其个人目的；或由于旧社会剥削阶级意识的影响，对婚姻问题不采取慎重正确的严肃态度，以致造成许多不应有的离婚纠纷，甚至造成若干不幸事件。因此，负责处理婚姻纠纷案件的机关和干部，应依据婚姻法的精神，分清不同情况，作不同处理。对原系封建压迫婚姻的离婚案件，应从实际出发，酌情准予离婚；对那些不正确的离婚案件，就应向他们进行严肃的巩固婚姻关系的教育，作必要的调解，以保证婚姻法的正确执行。只有这样，才能培养男女在新社会里的新婚姻观念，建立幸福团结的家庭。
    同时，婚姻法不仅要有计划地在群众中深入展开宣传教育，而且首先要有计划地在干部中进行细致的研究学习，使其领会婚姻法的精神，并以身作则，忠实地为婚姻法的贯彻而努力。特别在农村基层干部中，他们在男女关系上的封建思想还很严重，有的认为妇女提出离婚就是不正派不老实，因此硬性压制，不作公平处理；有的把妇女当财产，妇女受了虐待还不许离婚，要离婚，就得给男方粮食或金钱，说这样才不致“人财两空”；有的年纪大的乡长，乡支部书记或农会主席，一面领导群众向地主阶级进行反封建斗争，另一面却又自己抱童养媳，或则为年轻的儿子娶年长的老婆。因此，必须抓紧对基层干部的教育。对于个别干部擅敢破坏婚姻法，干涉男女婚姻自由因而造成被干涉者的伤害或死亡者，应坚决依法严加惩处。只有这样，才能使婚姻法在群众中真正贯彻下去。
    婚姻法是伴随着中国人民的解放而产生的。诚如中共中央给全党的通知上所说：“正确地实行婚姻法，不仅将使中国男女群众——尤其是妇女群众，从几千年野蛮落后的旧婚姻制度下解放出来，而且可以建立新的婚姻制度、新的家庭关系、新的社会生活和新的社会道德，以促进新民主主义中国的政治建设、经济建设、文化建设和国防建设的发展。”但婚姻法的制定和颁布，仅仅是问题获得解决的开始，并不等于旧婚姻制度的死亡。坚决地、认真地、正确地贯彻执行婚姻法，这是各级人民政府、各人民团体以及广大群众的共同任务。
