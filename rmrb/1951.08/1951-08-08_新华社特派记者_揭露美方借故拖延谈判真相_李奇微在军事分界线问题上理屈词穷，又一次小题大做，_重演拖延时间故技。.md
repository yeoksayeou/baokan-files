　　Xinhua News Agency Reveals the Truth About the U.S. Side’s Pretext for Delaying Negotiations

　　Ridgway, at a Loss for Words on the Military Demarcation Line Issue, Overreacted Again, Repeating the Old Trick of Delaying Time.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th] This agency's special correspondent reports: The 20th meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations, scheduled to continue at 10:00 AM (Korean time) on August 5th, was postponed because Ridgway used the accidental incident of some of our security personnel mistakenly entering the conference area as an excuse not to come to Kaesong. Regarding our side's investigation and handling of this accidental incident, our liaison officer specifically and clearly answered the U.S. representative on the morning of the 5th and guaranteed that similar incidents would not occur again in the future. People from all walks of life here praised our side's serious and conscientious attitude towards any issue and believe that this once again demonstrated our sincerity in the Korean armistice negotiations and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

　　As far as this reporter knows, similar incidents have also occurred on the U.S. side during the Kaesong negotiation meetings. For example, on the afternoon of July 16th, an incident occurred in the U.S. area more than 20 miles east of Kaesong in which a small number of armed soldiers fired shots towards the Panmunjom direction of our side at the entrance to the neutral zone. After receiving a local report, our representative notified the U.S. representative at the meeting on the 17th to pay attention. However, our representative was unwilling to use this as an excuse to make an issue of it, and even less to use it to coerce and obstruct the progress of the meeting. This is also enough to illustrate our side's sincerity in the armistice negotiation meetings.

　　From the beginning of the Korean armistice negotiation meetings to now, it has only been 29 days, with only 19 meetings held, but during this period, meetings have been suspended twice due to incidents other than the main issues of the meeting. The first time was on July 12th, when Ridgway used the trivial issues of reporter interviews and designating Kaesong as a temporary neutral zone as an excuse to suspend the meeting to discuss the agenda for three days. This time, Ridgway again used the accidental incident of some of our security personnel mistakenly entering the conference area as an excuse to decide that his delegation would not come to Kaesong for the meeting.

　　People will ask: What is Ridgway doing this for? If we study this incident in connection with the Kaesong meetings of the past ten days, it is not difficult to find the essential answer.

　　From July 26th to August 4th, the central issue discussed at the Kaesong meetings was the issue of establishing a military demarcation line to establish a demilitarized zone. Our representative repeatedly elaborated on the fair and reasonable proposal of using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line at various meetings, and refuted the absurd proposal put forward by the U.S. representative to extend the military demarcation line deep into our army's positions north of the 38th parallel. The U.S. side knew that this absurd proposal was unreasonable and had been keeping it a secret from the outside world until July 31st, when Agence France-Presse first revealed it. This forced Ridgway Headquarters in Tokyo to issue it on August 4th by the Headquarters News Education Bureau under the name of "Background Material on the Establishment of a Demilitarized Zone." However, before Ridgway was forced to publish this absurd proposal in Tokyo, General Joye at the Munsan advance base in Korea kept his mouth shut and tried to cover up this proposal in many ways. The U.S. delegation's brigadier general press officer even pretended to be serious and said to reporters that if you draw a line in the vast area between the Yalu River and the current battle line, it would be a serious mistake and the most absurd speculation. When this conversation reached the ears of reporters in Tokyo who had already read the background material, they rushed to ask Ridgway Headquarters again. The headquarters spokesperson replied that what they had published themselves was correct. Because of the confusion between Ridgway in Tokyo and Joye in Munsan, a group of British and American reporters were confused. No wonder even the Reuters reporter said in a news lead that the line the United Nations was asking for had reached a mysterious level today. This reporter also commented on the absurd plan published in Tokyo, saying: It is the first time in history that a belligerent party has demanded territory based on its air and sea power. This was the embarrassing and chaotic situation that Ridgway was in front of people all over the world before the evening of August 4th.

　　At the 19th meeting of the armistice negotiations held in Kaesong on August 4th, both sides agreed to continue the meeting at 10:00 AM the next day. Regarding the accidental incident of some of our security personnel mistakenly entering the conference area, Joye only notified our side at the end of the meeting, and our representative expressed that they would conduct an investigation and reply. In the press release issued by Joye after the meeting ended and he returned to Munsan, it still said that the meeting on the 5th would be held as scheduled. Until 6:20 AM (Tokyo time) on the 5th, Tokyo broadcast Ridgway's letter to Generals Kim and Peng, so the delegation led by Joye, which had repeatedly said it would come to Kaesong, could only comply with Ridgway's will and not come to Kaesong for the meeting.

　　People here generally believe that Ridgway's overreaction and obstruction of the progress of the armistice negotiation meetings are precisely because he is at a loss for words on the issue of determining the armistice military demarcation line and establishing a demilitarized zone, and the truth has been revealed, placing him in an unfavorable and passive position. In order to divert people's attention and buy time, he is even trying to use imagined pressure, and he is repeating the old trick of July 12th. However, this reporter believes that the eyes of the people of the world are discerning and will never be fooled by him. And people have a deeper understanding of the U.S. side, which claims to have peaceful sincerity.

    揭露美方借故拖延谈判真相
    李奇微在军事分界线问题上理屈词穷，又一次小题大做，重演拖延时间故技。
    【新华社开城七日电】本社特派记者报道：预定在八月五日上午十时（朝鲜时间）继续举行的朝鲜停战谈判第二十次会议，由于李奇微借口我方部分警卫人员误入会议地区的偶发事件未来开城，而致延期。关于我方对这次偶发事件的检查及处理经过，我方联络官已在五日晨具体明确地答复了美方代表，并保证类此事件以后不再发生。此间各界人士盛赞我方这种对待任何问题严肃认真的态度，并认为此乃又一次表明了我方对朝鲜停战谈判及和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意。
    据记者所知，在开城谈判会议进行期间，美方亦有类似事件发生。如七月十六日下午在开城以东二十余里美方地区曾发生有少数武装士兵向中立区入口处我板门店方向射击情事，我方代表接获当地报告后，在十七日会议上通知美方代表注意。但我方代表决不愿借此借题发挥，更未以此要挟阻挠会议进行，此事亦足以说明我方对停战谈判会议的诚意。
    从朝鲜停战谈判会议开始到现在，为时不过二十九天，开会不过十九次，但是在这期间前后却已因会议主要讨论事项以外的事件停开了两次。第一次是七月十二日李奇微借口记者采访和划开城为暂时的中立区的枝节问题，而使讨论议程问题的会议停开三天之久。这次李奇微又借口我方部分警卫人员误入会议地区的偶发事件，决定其代表团不来开城开会。
    人们会发问：李奇微这样做法是为了什么缘故？如果把这次事件和最近十天来的开城会议联系起来研究，人们就不难找到本质的答案。
    从七月二十六日到本月四日，开城会议讨论的中心议题是关于确立双方军事分界线以建立非军事区问题。我方代表在历次会议上再三阐述以三八线作为军事分界线的公平合理的主张，并批驳了美方代表所提出的将军事分界线深入三八线以北我军阵地的荒谬提案。美方提出这个荒谬提案自知理屈，一直对外界保守秘密，直到七月三十一日始为法新社首先透露出来，这一下逼得东京的李奇微总部不得不在八月四日由总部新闻教育局以“关于建立非军事区的背景材料”的名义发表出来。但是当李奇微在东京被迫发表这个荒谬提案之前，在朝鲜汶山前进基地的乔埃还守口如瓶，多方掩饰这个提案。美方代表团的准将新闻官还故作正经地对记者说什么如果你在鸭绿江和目前战线之间的广大地区划一条线就是一种严重的错误，而且是一种最荒唐的推想。这个谈话传到在东京的已经读过背景材料的记者的耳朵里，他们又连忙去问李奇微总部。总部的发言人回答说他们自己发表的东西是对的。由于东京的李奇微和汶山的乔埃之间乱了阵，弄得一群英美记者莫名其妙。怪不得连路透社的记者也在一条新闻导语中说，究竟联合国要求一条什么线，今天已达到了一个神秘的程度。这个记者并且对东京所发表的荒谬方案发表意见说：交战一方根据空中和海上的威力要求领土，这还是历史上的第一次。这就是在八月四日傍晚以前李奇微在全世界人们面前所处的尴尬狼狈的情况。
    八月四日在开城举行的停战谈判的第十九次会议上，双方同意在第二天上午十时继续开会。关于我方部分警卫人员误入会议地区的偶发事件，乔埃只在会议结束时通知我方，我方代表并表示要进行检查和答复。当会议结束乔埃回到汶山后发表的会议公报中，仍说五日的会议将按预定时间举行，直到下午七点钟（朝鲜时间）合众社的报道还是说四日的偶发事件并不影响预定的会期。五日六时二十分（东京时间）东京广播了李奇微给金、彭两将军的信件，于是一再说要来开会的以乔埃为首的代表团也只能顺从李奇微的意志不来开城开会。
    此间一般人士认为：李奇微又一次的小题大做，阻挠停战谈判会议的进行，正是因为他在确定停战军事分界线、建立非军事区的问题上理屈词穷而又真情泄露，处在一种不利的被动的地位的缘故。为了转移人们的视线，争取时间，他甚至试用想像中的压力，他又在重演七月十二日的故技。但是，记者相信，全世界人民的眼睛是雪亮的，决不会上他的当。而人们对口口声声说具有和平诚意的美方，却因此有了更深刻的认识。
