　　Beijing Yongmao Company Illegally Engages in Timber Trade
　　Joint Timber Inspection Team Has Inspected the Company
　　[This newspaper dispatch] Beijing: The state-owned Yongmao Construction Company of Beijing, in violation of the notice issued on January 6th of last year by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government to all departments and their affiliated enterprises in Guannei, prohibiting the purchase of timber in the Northeast, has been taking advantage of its favorable business conditions to engage in large-scale timber trading. According to preliminary materials from the joint timber inspection team, from the first half of last year to July of this year, the company has successively purchased more than 54,600 cubic meters of timber in various parts of the Northeast (a small amount of which was purchased in Tianjin and Beijing). Apart from supplying more than 6,000 cubic meters to the company itself for use as construction materials, from January to July of this year, according to preliminary statistics, it has already sold more than 15,000 cubic meters to private merchants, state-owned enterprises, government agencies, schools, and organizations. Among them, 8,265 cubic meters were sold to private timber firms, timber mills, and construction companies. If calculated at a price of 1.5 million yuan per cubic meter, the funds used by the company to operate the timber business amount to more than 80 billion yuan.
　　Yongmao Construction Company's timber trading began as early as 1949. In March of this year, the Beijing Municipal Financial and Economic Committee, in order to solve the housing difficulties for public and civilian use in the city, decided that the company should build an additional 20,000 houses, and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Council allocated more than 12,000 cubic meters of timber to the company for this construction project. At this time, the company bought and sold timber on an even larger scale. This can be proven by the following facts: For example, in 1950, the company purchased 7,060 cubic meters of timber, from January to March 1951, it purchased 2,766 cubic meters, and from April to July 1951, it purchased 44,785 cubic meters. In terms of sales, in 1950, it sold approximately 3,000 cubic meters, from January to March 1951, it sold 2,522 cubic meters, and from March to July 1951, it sold 12,550 cubic meters. Moreover, the majority of the sales were of red and white pine logs and finished timber suitable for construction.
　　Because Yongmao Construction Company's timber purchase and sales operations have affected the price and supply of timber in the Beijing timber market, on May 28th of this year, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government sent a letter to the Beijing Municipal People's Government requesting that it inspect and correct Yongmao Company's timber purchase and sales operations. The original letter stated: "According to a report from the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, Beijing Yongmao Construction Company is operating the purchase and sale of timber beyond the scope of its own business, constantly transporting it from the Northeast to Beijing and then transferring it to Tianjin, Shanghai and other places for sale, causing timber prices to be chaotic and affecting market control. Please stop this."
　　However, the Beijing Municipal Financial Committee put forward incorrect opinions on this issue. The reply from the Beijing Municipal Financial and Economic Committee on July 20th stated: "Regarding whether the company should engage in timber business, our opinion is: in order to meet the construction needs of the company, in the case of insufficient supply from state-owned trading departments, it can purchase from producing areas. Although the Building Materials Company is responsible for the supply task after its establishment, the quantity is insufficient and the specifications and quality are not suitable for construction needs, so not only Yongmao Construction Company, but also other construction departments are purchasing from the Northeast on their own. Now the Materials Department of Yongmao Construction Company has been reorganized into Yongmao Building Materials Company, and its sale of timber is mainly based on supplying the construction company itself. If there is a surplus and it is not suitable for construction needs, it will be sold to construction departments at reasonable prices under the guidance of the Municipal Financial Committee and the Industry and Commerce Bureau. For purchases from other places coming to Beijing, supplies will be considered in accordance with the principle of conforming to the direction of circulation. The price is high because it is purchased from the Forestry Bureau's promotional timber, and the quality is also higher than that of the Equipment Company (referring to the Coal Industry Building Materials Company), so the selling price is difficult to be consistent with the listed price."
　　The above-mentioned opinions of the Beijing Municipal Financial Committee are obviously not in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Council, and are also not in line with the actual situation of Yongmao Company. The committee should strictly supervise Yongmao Company's inspection work and make due self-criticism in this regard.

　　北京永茂公司违法经营木材贸易
    木材联合检查组已对该公司进行检查
    【本报讯】北京市公营永茂建筑公司，违背中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会去年一月六日发出的关内各部及所属企业不得在东北采购木材的通知，利用本身业务的有利条件，大量经营木材生意。经木材联合检查组初步材料：自去年上半年起至今年七月止，该公司先后在东北各地购进木材五万四千六百余立方公尺（其中有少数是在天津、北京购买的），除供应本公司作为建筑材料的六千余立方公尺以外，从今年一月到七月止，据初步统计已经在市场上出售给私商及国营企业部门、机关、学校、团体等共一万五千余立方公尺。其中售给私商木行、木厂和营造厂的，有八千二百六十五立方公尺。如以每立方公尺一百五十万元的价格计算，则该公司用来经营木材的资金即达八百多亿元。
    永茂建筑公司的木材买卖，早在一九四九年即已开始，今年三月间，北京市财政经济委员会为解决市内公用和民用的房屋困难，决定由该公司增建二万间房屋，并由政务院财政经济委员会调拨给该公司一万二千余立方公尺木材，作为该项建筑工程之用。这时该公司更大量地买卖木材。这从下面的事实可以证明：例如一九五○年该公司购进木材为七千零六十立方公尺，一九五一年一月至三月为二千七百六十六立方公尺，而一九五一年四月至七月则为四万四千七百八十五立方公尺。出卖方面，一九五○年约为三千余立方公尺，一九五一年一月至三月为二千五百二十二立方公尺，而一九五一年三月至七月则为一万二千五百五十立方公尺。而且出卖的大部分是可供建筑用的红、白松原木和成材。
    由于永茂建筑公司经营购销木材已影响北京木材市场价格和木材的供应，今年五月二十八日，中央人民政府贸易部曾函请北京市人民政府检查纠正永茂公司经营木材购销业务。原函略称：“据中国煤业建筑器材公司报告，北京市永茂建筑公司，超出本身业务范围，经营购销木材，不断自东北贩运来京，并转运至津沪各地销售，致使木价紊乱，影响市场掌握，请予制止。”
    但是，北京市财委在这个问题上，却提出了错误的意见。七月二十日北京市财政经济委员会复函略称：“关于该公司应否经营木材，我们意见：为了本公司建筑需要，在国营贸易部门供应不足的情况下，可以到产地采购。建筑材料公司成立后，虽负有供应任务，但因数量不足及规格质量不适合建筑需要，故不仅永茂建筑公司，即其他建筑部门亦有自行到东北采购情形。现永茂建筑公司材料部改组为永茂建筑材料公司，其出售木材主要以供应本建筑公司使用为原则，如有剩余及不适合建筑需要，在市财委、工商局指导下以合理价格出售给建筑部门。对外地来京采购，在适合流转方向的原则下，斟酌供应。其价格因购自林务局推销材，来价高，而且质量比器材公司（按指煤业建筑器材公司）亦高，故售价很难与牌价一致。”
    北京市财委上述意见，显然是不合政务院财经委员会的法令，而且也不合乎永茂公司的实际情况。该会应严格督促永茂公司检查工作，并在这方面作应有的检讨。
