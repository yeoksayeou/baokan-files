Inspection of Capital Construction at the Fujiatan Coal Mine in Shanxi

The Fujiatan Coal Mine, under the Shanxi Coal Mining Company (180 kilometers south of Taiyuan), held a meeting on August 10th and 11th to review its capital construction work for the past six months. Except for the completion of the Nanguan pit tunnels and the horizontal pit ventilation shaft project, as well as some mechanical and electrical installation and repair work (including the manufacture of eighty coal cars), most projects were not completed as planned due to insufficient attention from leading cadres and inadequate planning and design.

The material transport roadway is the main project of the horizontal pit. This project was originally scheduled to start in February and be completed in April, then changed to June; but it is still not completed. The 50-horsepower winch in the pit cannot be completed on time due to this impact. The Nanguan coal yard switch was originally planned to be completed by the end of June, but has not yet started. The completed projects were also not completed according to the original plan in most cases. Moreover, some projects could not fully play their role in production because related projects could not be completed on time. For example, the Nanguan pit tunnel project was completed in March, but due to the lack of stone, the rails were not laid, and the coal cars could not be used, so manual transportation had to be continued. The 30 kV transformer for the power plant has been installed, but it still cannot generate electricity because the transformer room has not been built.

The financial system in capital construction is also extremely chaotic. The Nanguan pit tunnel and horizontal pit ventilation shaft projects were completed in March and May, respectively, but have not yet been finalized. There are no accurate figures for how much each project cost and how much more is needed, making it impossible for the leadership to control the situation. Due to the above reasons, production could not be expanded as planned, and costs could not be reduced as planned. For example, the average daily output of the horizontal pit in August only reached 77% of the original plan. The average daily output of the Nanguan pit in August only reached 74% of the original plan. The total output of the mine also only reached 88% of the original plan. (The above data is based on statistics from the first half of August.)

The meeting analyzed and criticized the main shortcomings in capital construction:

1.  Lack of thorough investigation and research, rough design, and unrealistic plans resulted in the inability to complete work according to the plan. The plan was not made to have a clear understanding and grasp the progress of the project, but to account for official business in order to be quickly approved to start work. Under the domination of this erroneous ideology, when making plans, no attention was paid to going through the masses and giving play to the wisdom of the masses. Instead, the engineering staff sat in the office and made a general estimate based on the plans made by the Japanese in the past. After the construction of the material transport roadway in the horizontal pit started, the leading cadres asked the pit entrance and the contractor to execute the contract. The pit entrance did not even know how the plan was made. Therefore, the plan was far from reality, and temporary problems were modified and changed, losing the role of the plan. For example, the Nanguan pit needed eighty coal cars, originally planned to be completed by the end of March, but the actual plan was made in April, and some materials had not been purchased when construction started. The Nanguan pit's 10-horsepower hoist road was originally planned as a single track, but later changed to a double track and replaced with a 20-horsepower hoist. The material transport roadway originally planned for 17 tons of rails, but now 20 tons have been used and still not completely laid. The Nanguan pit actually needs 700 meters of water pipe, but only 500 meters were planned, resulting in insufficient water pipes. After the plan was decided, there was a lack of precise and thorough design. For example, the wooden bridge of the material transport roadway is the central link, but now the roadbed and winch installation have been completed, and the wooden bridge has not yet been designed; the parking cave was also not originally designed, but was added only after it was temporarily discovered. Various projects lacked complete and detailed design plans, which led to mutual involvement, delay, and the inability to complete the project on time.

2.  Unclear responsibilities, loose organization, lack of coordination between departments, mutual waiting, delayed the progress of the project. For example, the material transport roadway, the roadbed was contracted by the construction company, the winch was installed by the mechanical and electrical department, the pit entrance was responsible for laying the track, and the capital construction department was responsible for the wooden bridge design and contracting. There was a lack of unified organization, different understanding, and different speeds between these four departments, resulting in non-cooperation. Another example is the winch base of the material transport line in the horizontal pit, which was designed by the planning section, estimated by the mechanical and electrical section, and contracted by the capital construction section but subcontracted to the mechanical and electrical section. The division of responsibilities between each other was not clear, the work was delayed, and they blamed each other, with no one taking responsibility. During the project, the leading cadres could not separate the importance and urgency, grasp the key points, and appropriately organize the forces to carry out the project. Instead, they approved all projects to start without consideration, resulting in the inability to complete any of them on time.

3.  Contracting out both labor and materials affected the progress of the project. For example, the newly built brick kiln in Nanguan pit was contracted to a contractor for both labor and materials. Because the contractor could not fire the bricks, it could not be completed on time. The supply department did not adequately estimate this situation in advance, and did not prepare the brick-firing force to fire the bricks during the spring brick-firing season to ensure the progress of the project. In order to avoid stopping work, the bricks prepared by the factory for building the plant and transformer room were lent to the contractor, but this also affected the start of construction of the plant and transformer room.

The basic reason for the above problems is that the administrative leadership of the mine lacks a clear understanding of the guiding principles and policies of capital construction, and does not pay enough attention to it. They regard planning, design, and construction as purely technical issues, rely entirely on technical personnel, and the administrative leadership only provides general leadership, lacking specific arrangements and timely and in-depth inspection. A series of problems such as inadequate planning, disconnection between departments, and unclear responsibilities were not resolved or corrected in a timely manner; nor were the capital construction personnel organized to systematically study the relevant capital construction business and policies. The first capital construction meeting in half a year was not held until June 15th, and the main shortcomings were not thoroughly reviewed at the meeting. Many cadres simply emphasized objective difficulties, saying that the material supply could not keep up or that there was a lack of personnel. The leading cadres were confused by this erroneous ideology, so the main problems were not resolved at the meeting. The engineering and technical personnel, influenced by bourgeois ideology, had an insufficient understanding of the new democratic industrial construction policy, were rough in their work, did not go deep into reality, only planned and designed in the office, lacked a high sense of responsibility for the people's property, and did not adopt a serious, prudent and scientific attitude towards capital construction, resulting in serious losses.

At this meeting, the administrative leading cadres made a preliminary self-criticism and criticized the above-mentioned various erroneous ideas, and put forward the direction of future efforts: to establish a correct attitude towards capital construction, implement the technical responsibility system, and carry out various projects in a focused and steady manner according to their importance and urgency, to avoid repeating past lessons.

　　山西富家滩煤矿检查基本建设
    山西煤矿公司所属富家滩煤矿（在太原以南一百八十公里）在八月十日、十一日召开会议，对半年来的基本建设工作进行了检查。半年来除完成南关坑坑道及水平坑风井工程和一部分机电按装修制工作外（包括八十辆煤车制做在内），大部工程由于领导干部重视不够，计划设计不周，都未按计划完成。材料运搬道是水平坑的主要工程。这个工程原计划二月开工，四月完成，后又改为六月完成；但直到现在还未完成。坑内五十马力的转车受这影响也不能按时完成。南关煤库道岔原计划六月底完工，但至今还没动工。所完成的工程也大都不是按原计划完成的。而且有些工程因有关工程不能按时完成而不能充分发挥它在生产上的作用。如南关坑道工程，是三月完工的。但因石?工程没有完成，道轨没有铺上，煤车也不能用，不得不延用人力运搬。电场三十千伏安电机已装好，因电机房还未盖仍不能发电。基本建设中财务制度也极其混乱。南关坑道和水平坑风井工程在三月和五月就完工了，现在还未决算。
    每件工程用了多少款，还得用多少，都无精确数字，使领导方面无法掌握。由于以上原因，使生产不能按计划扩大，成本也不能按计划降低。比如水平坑八月份每日平均产量仅达到原计划的百分之七十七。南关坑八月份每日平均产量仅达原计划百分之七十四。全矿的生产量也仅达到原计划的百分之八十八。（以上材料以八月前半月统计）
    会议对基本建设中的主要缺点进行了分析和批判：
    一、缺乏周密调查研究，设计粗枝大叶，计划不切实际，结果不能按计划完成工作。作计划不是为了心中有数，掌握工程进度，而是为了交待公事，以便很快批准开工。在这种错误思想的支配下，在作计划时，就不注意通过群众，发挥群众智慧，而是工程人员坐在办公室内根据过去日本人作的计划方案进行概括的估计。水平坑材料运搬道开工后，领导干部让坑口与包工的人执行合同，坑口还不知道计划是如何作的。因此，计划与实际距离很大，临时发生问题修改变更，失去计划的作用。如南关坑煤车八十辆，原计划三月底完成，实际作出计划已是四月份了，动工时有的材料还没有买到。南关坑十马力高车路原计划是单轨，后来改成双轨，并换成二十马力高车。材料运搬道道轨原计划十七吨，现在用了二十吨还没有铺完。南关坑内水管实际需七百公尺，但只计划了五百公尺，结果水管不够用。在计划决定之后，缺乏精确周密的设计。如材料运搬道的木桥是中心环节，但现在路基及电绞车按装都已完成，木桥还没有设计出来；停车洞原来也没有设计，也是临时发觉才添做的。各种工程都没有完整周详的设计计划，以致互相牵扯，耽误时间，影响工程不能按时完成。
    二、责任制不明确，组织涣散，各部门互不连系，互相等待，延误了工程进行。如材料运搬道，路基由建筑公司包作，电绞车由机电科按装，由坑口负责铺道，基本建设科负责木桥设计与出包。这四部门之间缺乏统一组织，认识不一，进度迟快不一，结果配合不上。又如水平坑材料运搬线电绞车底座，计划科设计，机电科估工，基本建设科包工又交机电科承做，相互之间责任划分不明确，工作延误了，互相埋怨，无人负责。工程进行中，领导干部不能分开轻重缓急，掌握重点，适当组织力量进行，而是不加考虑地一律批准开工，结果都不能按时完工。
    三、连工带料都包出去，影响了工程的进行。如南关坑新建砖窑连工带料包给包工户，因包工户砖烧不出来，不能按时完成。供应部门对这种情况事先估计不足，没有准备烧砖力量在春季烧砖季节将砖烧出，保证工程的进行。为了不使停工，才把厂方准备盖场房和电机房用的砖借给包工户使用，但又影响场房和电机房不能开工。
    造成以上问题的基本原因是该矿行政领导上对基本建设的方针与政策缺乏明确认识，重视不够。把计划、设计、施工看成单纯的技术问题，完全依靠技术人员，行政领导上只作原则的领导，缺乏具体布置与及时深入的检查。对于计划不周，各科脱节，责任不明确等一系列的问题，也未及时解决或纠正；也没有有计划有系统地组织基本建设人员学习有关基本建设业务与政策。六月十五日才召开了半年以来的第一次基本建设会议，会上也未针对主要缺点进行彻底检查。许多干部都是单纯地强调客观困难，不是说材料供应不上，就是说人员缺乏。领导干部被迷惑在这种错误思想之内，以致会议上并未解决主要问题。工程技术人员则因受资产阶级思想的影响，对新民主主义的工业建设方针认识不足，在工作中粗枝大叶，不深入实际，只坐在办公室里计划设计，缺乏对人民财产高度负责的精神，对基本建设未采取严肃慎重与科学的态度，以致造成严重损失。
    这次会议上，行政领导干部作了初步的自我检查，并对上述各种错误思想进行了批判，提出了今后努力的方向：树立对基本建设的正确态度，贯彻技术责任制，各种工程分开轻重缓急有重点地稳步进行，避免重复过去的教训。
