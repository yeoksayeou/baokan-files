Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 5th: The leadership of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued a commendation order, praising seven meritorious companies that achieved victories with smaller forces against larger enemies and annihilated large numbers of enemy troops in the battles north of Hwacheon. Among them, two companies were awarded the collective first-class merit, namely the 6th Company of a certain regiment and the 5th Company of a certain regiment. The 6th Company was brave and resourceful in holding a certain height, repeatedly repelling several fierce attacks by five enemy companies. In a counterattack, a squad from the company annihilated an enemy platoon. In five days of fighting, the company, at the cost of forty casualties, killed or wounded more than three hundred enemy soldiers. The 5th Company, while defending a certain height north of Hwacheon City, was surrounded by the enemy on three sides, but they bravely resisted five group assaults by two enemy battalions under the cover of twenty tanks, four airplanes, and a榴弹炮团 (translator please note: artillery regiment is likely the best translation but feel free to substitute if you believe there's something better) , holding the position for four days. At the cost of thirty casualties, they killed or wounded more than two hundred enemy soldiers, dealing a heavy blow to the frantically advancing enemy.

Five companies were awarded the collective second-class merit, namely the "Yang Gensi Hero Company" of a certain regiment, the 6th Company of a certain regiment, the 7th Company of a certain regiment, the 8th Company of a certain regiment, and the 2nd Company of a certain regiment. On the evening of June 6th, the "Yang Gensi Hero Company" used two platoons to counterattack the enemy on a certain height, successively capturing four hilltops, annihilating an American company, and seizing four heavy machine guns. In the defensive battle on a certain height northwest of Hwacheon, the 6th Company used only two squads to resist the continuous attacks of an enemy battalion under the cover of seven tanks, four airplanes, and fierce artillery fire. When they ran out of grenades, they fought the enemy with stones, killing or wounding more than one hundred and fifty enemy soldiers, while their position remained steadfast. The 7th Company repelled nine fierce enemy attacks in eight days and seven nights of defending a certain mountain, killing or wounding nearly three hundred enemy soldiers. In the defensive battle on a certain height, the 8th Company repelled more than ten large and small enemy attacks, killing or wounding more than four hundred Rhee's puppet troops. When the company was ordered to withdraw, its 3rd Platoon was surrounded by the enemy. However, under the calm command of Platoon Leader Shen Rugen, the platoon killed or wounded more than one hundred enemy soldiers along the way during the breakout operation. In a defensive battle in a certain area, the 2nd Company, with more than thirty casualties, killed or wounded more than two hundred American soldiers.
