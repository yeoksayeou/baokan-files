Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: Truman's special diplomatic advisor, Harriman's month-long "mediation" activities in Iran, fully exposed the United States' aggressive ambitions for Iranian oil.

Harriman arrived in Tehran on July 15th, after the breakdown of negotiations between Iran and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Subsequently, he immediately drafted a proposal for the Iranian and British governments to resume negotiations to resolve the Iranian oil issue. Prior to this, the Iranian government had refused to negotiate with the British government delegation. On July 23rd, the Iranian government formally submitted this proposal to Britain. Due to the British side's delayed response, Harriman personally went to London on July 28th. That day, Harriman attended a special meeting chaired by British Prime Minister Attlee to discuss the Iranian oil issue. Harriman's two days of activities in London finally led Britain to agree to Harriman's suggestion. Thus, negotiations between representatives of the British and Iranian governments began in Tehran on August 6th, under Harriman's supervision.

The behind-the-scenes agreements between Harriman and Iran and Britain have not been officially announced. According to Beirut's "Al-Sharq" newspaper, Harriman suggested that the Iranian National Oil Company be responsible for the production of Iranian crude oil, and that another oil company be established, jointly operated by Iran, Britain, and the United States, responsible for the refining and sale of oil. This would leave the most important rights of Iranian oil production still in the hands of imperialists. According to a report from the Telepress Agency, Britain has agreed to give 50% of the rights to refine and distribute Iranian oil products to the United States. In order to reward Britain's concessions, the United States promised to ensure that the negotiations between Britain and Iran would reach a solution that would benefit British interests in Iran.

Even before Harriman went to Tehran, representatives of American oil companies had already begun activities in Tehran. Although the negotiations have not yet ended, Washington is already cheering for Harriman's "success." According to a report from the Telepress Agency on the 15th, Johnson, Deputy Director of the Office of Near Eastern, Southeast Asian, and African Affairs of the US State Department, shamelessly said while reporting the results of Harriman's negotiations with Britain and Iran to representatives of American oil companies: "If there is another negotiation like this, all the oil resources in the Middle East will fall into our hands."

The Iranian people fully recognize this conspiracy of American and British imperialism, and they oppose capitulation to the US and Britain. At the unanimous request of the people of Iran, the Iranian government formally rejected the proposals put forward by the British delegation in the negotiations on August 14th. Now, the negotiations have reached a stalemate.

　　伊朗人民反对向美英屈服
    伊英石油谈判僵持
    哈里曼的阴谋活动，暴露了美国对伊朗石油的野心
    【新华社二十日讯】杜鲁门的特别外交顾问哈里曼在伊朗的一个多月的“调停”活动，充分暴露了美国对伊朗石油的侵略野心。
    哈里曼是在伊朗与英伊石油公司的谈判破裂之后，于七月十五日到达德黑兰的。之后，他立即拟定了一个伊朗政府和英国政府重新举行谈判，以解决伊朗石油问题的建议。而在这以前，伊朗政府是拒绝和英国政府代表团谈判的。七月二十三日，伊朗政府正式向英国提出这一建议。由于英国方面迟迟没有答复，哈里曼于七月二十八日亲自去伦敦。当天，哈里曼参加了英国首相艾德礼主持的讨论伊朗石油问题的特别会议。哈里曼在伦敦的两天活动，终于使英国同意了哈里曼的意见。这样，英伊两国政府代表的谈判，在哈里曼的监视下，于八月六日在德黑兰开始。
    哈里曼和伊朗及英国的幕后协议，官方没有公布。据贝鲁特《东方报》消息：哈里曼曾建议由伊朗国营石油公司负责伊朗原油的生产，另外成立一个石油公司，由伊朗、英国和美国联合经营，负责石油的提炼和出售。这就使得伊朗石油生产最重要的权利，仍然操纵在帝国主义者手里。据电通社消息：英国已同意将伊朗石油的产品。石油的提炼和分配权，让百分之五十给美国。而为了酬谢英国的让步，美国答应使英伊双方的谈判获致一个有利于英国在伊朗的利益的解决办法。
    早在哈里曼去德黑兰之前，美国的石油公司代表已开始在德黑兰活动。虽然谈判现在还没有结束，华盛顿方面却已经在为哈里曼的“成功”欢呼了。据电通社十五日消息：美国国务院近东、东南亚与非洲事务司副司长约翰逊在向美国石油公司代表报告哈里曼和英伊双方谈判的结果时无耻地说：“假如再来一次象这样的谈判，中东全部石油资源都要落在我们手里了。”
    伊朗人民充分认识到美英帝国主义的这一阴谋，他们反对向美英屈服。在伊朗全国人民的一致要求下，伊朗政府于八月十四日正式拒绝了英国代表团在谈判中提出的建议。现在，谈判已成僵持局面。
