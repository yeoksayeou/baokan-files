The Jilin Provincial People's Court and Other Organs
　　Arbitrarily Log and Sell Timber
　　Causing Severe Damage to Forests

Some organs in Jilin Province have violated government decrees by arbitrarily engaging in logging and timber sales as a form of institutional production, seeking exorbitant profits. On January 23, 1950, the Northeast People's Government issued a notice prohibiting any organs or troops from logging or purchasing timber for institutional production. However, in the Huangsongdianzi District of Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, from January to April of this year, the Jilin Provincial People's Court, the Jiaohe County People's Court, the County Public Security Bureau, the County Enterprise Section, the Agricultural Section, the Huangsongdianzi District Government, the Antu County Enterprise Section, the County Secretary's Office, the County Cooperative, the Helong County Enterprise Section, and the Yanbian Special District Enterprise Section, engaged in large-scale logging in the mountains for institutional production, extracting a total of 58,500 cubic meters of dead and standing timber (“standing timber” refers to dead trees in the forest that have not yet been felled). If this timber is valued at an average price of 150,000 yuan per cubic meter, it would be worth over 8.77 billion yuan. After deducting 100,000 yuan per cubic meter for labor and miscellaneous expenses, the total profit would be over 2.92 billion yuan. In order to facilitate sales, the above-mentioned units sold the timber directly to private merchants, resulting in a large gathering of merchants in the Huangsongdianzi District of Jiaohe County to purchase timber. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of obtaining the stakes needed to transport the timber (i.e., the wooden stakes used around the flatbed trucks for transporting timber), the above-mentioned units also indiscriminately felled new trees. For example, in March of this year, Liu Jixiang, a farmer in Huangsongdianzi District, felled more than 300 new trees because the Jiaohe County Public Security Bureau purchased stakes from him. The Helong County Enterprise Section also arbitrarily felled more than 930 new trees. The tree species were mainly hard miscellaneous trees such as Amur cork, Manchurian ash, oak, and elm. Furthermore, the Antu County Enterprise Section felled 1,500 trees in the afforestation area of ​​the Xinshen Village, Fuxing District, in that county for use as stakes, resulting in a serious phenomenon of indiscriminate felling of new trees and damage to the forest.

　　吉林省人民法院等机关
    擅自采伐销售木材
    使森林遭受严重破坏
    吉林省部分机关违反政府法令，擅自以采伐、销售木材作为机关生产，牟取厚利。一九五零年一月二十三日，东北人民政府曾通知任何机关部队不得采伐、收购木材作为机关生产。但吉林省蛟河县黄松甸子区一个地方，今年一月至四月，即有吉林省人民法院、蛟河县人民法院、县公安局、县企业科、农业科、黄松甸子区政府，及安图县企业科、县秘书室、县合作社，和龙县企业科，延边专署企业科等单位，大规模入山采伐木材，作为机关生产，共拉出陈材、站杆五万八千五百立方公尺（“站杆”为森木中尚未砍伐的已死树木）。这些木材如以每立方公尺平均价格为十五万元计算，共值八十七亿七千余万元，每立方公尺扣除人工杂费十万元，即共获利润二十九亿二千余万元。上述各单位为了推销便利，竟坐地卖给私商，因而蛟河县黄松甸子区曾一度集结很多商人，收购木材。同时，上述各单位为了解决运输木材所需用的车立柱（按即运输木材时平板车四围所用的木柱子），又滥伐新树。如今年三月，黄松甸子区农民刘吉祥，因蛟河县公安局向他收购车立柱，即盗伐新树三百多株。和龙县企业科亦擅自砍伐新树九百三十余株。树种均为黄波罗、水曲柳、柞、榆等硬杂木；再如安图县企业科，在该县福兴区神仙村封山育林迹地砍伐一千五百株，作为车立柱，因而造成滥伐新树严重破坏森林的现象。
