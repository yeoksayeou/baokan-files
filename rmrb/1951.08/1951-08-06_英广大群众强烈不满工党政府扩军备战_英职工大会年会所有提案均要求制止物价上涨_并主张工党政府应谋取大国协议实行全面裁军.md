Xinhua News Agency, London, 3rd. The 83rd Annual Meeting of the British Trades Union Congress will open in Blackpool on September 23rd. The preliminary agenda of the annual meeting was published on July 30th. The proposals on the agenda reflect the growing dissatisfaction of the broad masses in the British trade union movement with the Labour government's foreign policy and arms expansion and war preparation plans.

Although many proposals, which had been strictly reviewed by the right-wing leaders of various trade unions, avoided mentioning that the deteriorating British economic situation was due to the Labour government's war preparation policy, almost all proposals expressed shock and strong protest against this deteriorating situation, especially the soaring prices, and demanded that the government immediately take effective measures to stop the rise in the cost of living and limit the profits of large enterprises. The Electrical Trades Union, the National Union of Railway Workers, the Civil Service Association, and the National Union of Vehicle Builders unanimously demanded wage increases. Many proposals angrily pointed out that while the profits of large enterprises continue to rise, the workers' pockets are becoming empty.

The Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen stated in a proposal that they were "appalled by the continued increase in military spending" and believed that "an arms race cannot achieve peace." The proposal demanded that the government seek a great power agreement to implement complete disarmament. The proposal also opposed the rearmament of West Germany and Japan. The Chemical Workers' Union and the Fire Brigades Union also opposed the rearmament of West Germany and Japan in their proposals.

The proposal of the Foundry Workers' Union demanded that the British government conduct equal trade with Eastern countries and opposed political discrimination against the Soviet Union, the Eastern European People's Democracies, and the People's Republic of China.

Four proposals indicated that trade union members were deeply indignant at the No. 1305 Order, unreasonably cited by the government, which undermines the right to strike.

　　英广大群众强烈不满工党政府扩军备战
    英职工大会年会所有提案均要求制止物价上涨
    并主张工党政府应谋取大国协议实行全面裁军
    【新华社三日讯】伦敦讯：英国职工大会第八十三届年会将于九月二十三日在布拉克浦开幕。年会的初步议程已于七月三十日发表，议程上的各项提案，反映出英国工会运动中的广大群众对工党政府的外交政策和扩军备战计划的不满已越来越强烈了。
    经过各工会右翼头子严密审查过的许多提案，虽然讳言英国经济情况恶化的原因是工党政府的备战政策，但是，几乎所有提案都对这种恶化的事实，特别是物价的飞涨表示震惊并提出强烈抗议，要求政府立即采取有力的措施制止生活费用的上涨，限制大企业利润。电气工会、全国铁路工人工会、公务员协会与全国造车工人联合会一致要求增加工资。许多提案愤怒地指出，当大企业利润不断上升的时候，工人们的口袋却变空了。
    机器和造船业设计师协会在提案中表示“对于军备费用的继续增高，不胜骇异”，并认为“军备竞赛不能取得和平”。该提案要求政府谋取大国协议，实行全面裁军。提案并反对重新武装西德和日本。化学工人工会和救火员工会也在提案中反对重新武装西德和日本。
    翻砂工人联合会的提案要求英政府与东方国家进行平等的贸易，反对对苏联、东欧人民民主国家和中华人民共和国采取政治上的歧视政策。
    四项提案表明：工会会员对于政府所无理引用的破坏罢工权利的一三○五号法令深为愤慨。
