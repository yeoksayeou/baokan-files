Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 27th: The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 24th commenting on the U.S. Air Force bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone, an attempt to assassinate our delegation, saying: "There has never been such a provocative act in the history of international negotiations." The newspaper continued: "The Korean liaison officers clearly stated to the U.S. side that under these circumstances, it is impossible to conduct genuine negotiations."

The newspaper listed the absurd demands made by the United States in the Kaesong negotiations, repeated provocations violating the Kaesong neutral zone agreement, and the fact that Ridgway launched a new offensive on the front lines, and then wrote: "The evidence is so conclusive that one can only draw one conclusion, that is: the U.S. side is determined to sabotage the peace talks, continue the war in Korea, and bring the tense situation in the Far East to a climax."

The "Daily Worker" pointed out: "All these deliberate actions occurred on the eve of the San Francisco U.S.-made peace treaty conference with Japan. This is no coincidence. If peace is achieved in Korea, it will leave the United States with no excuse to prepare for war and create tension. But if the negotiations break down and large-scale war resumes, the Americans can use the war to force countries that are unwilling to sign the U.S.-made peace 'treaty' with Japan to sign, and force them to agree to all war measures. This is the U.S. response to the Soviet proposal to eliminate tensions and conclude a five-power peace pact."

The newspaper concluded: "The British people must take action to smash these shameless plans that could ignite war throughout the Far East, otherwise world peace will be in danger."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 27th: The French newspaper "l'Humanité" published an editorial on the 24th saying: "The repeated provocations by the U.S. aggressors in the Kaesong negotiations, in the conference site area, have brought the serious situation in Korea to a dangerous point." The editorial continued: "The suspension of the armistice conference is the first consequence of this provocation. No one can believe that napalm bombs are not involved in the progress of the conference."

The newspaper pointed out that Malik's proposal had embarrassed the U.S. ruling clique. The United States was forced to participate in the conference under the pressure of world public opinion. Therefore, it "never forgets to use all means to make the negotiations unsuccessful." U.S. rulers issued murderous remarks; the U.S. side systematically and unreasonably rejected the reasonable proposal to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line; Ridgway deliberately interrupted the conference; the U.S. Air Force intensified its heinous bombing of Korean territory. All these facts show that U.S. criminals have never given up their plans to expand the Korean War and brew new wars.

The editorial concluded: "The people's actions can deal with the arbitrariness of imperialism and their means of using force, and the people's actions can make the spirit of negotiation triumph."

　　英工人日报与法人道报著论  斥美国破坏停战谈判
    【新华社布拉格二十七日电】伦敦《工人日报》二十四日发表社论，评论美国空军轰炸开城中立区，企图谋杀我方代表团的事件说：“在国际谈判史上从来还没有过这种挑衅行为。”该报接着说：“朝鲜联络官向美方明白表示得对，在这种情况之下，是不可能进行真正的谈判的。”
    该报列举美国在开城谈判中提出荒谬要求，一再进行挑衅违反开城中立区协定，以及李奇微在前线发动新攻势等事实，然后写道：“证据是这样确凿，人们只能得出一个结论，那就是：美国方面决心破坏和平谈判，在朝鲜继续进行战争，使远东的紧张局势达到顶点。”
    《工人日报》指出：“所有这些故意的举动发生在旧金山美制对日和约会议前夕。并不是偶然的。如果在朝鲜实现了和平，那就会使美国没有借口来进行战争准备与制造紧张局面。但是，如果谈判破裂了，大规模战事再起，美国人就可以利用战争来迫使那些不愿在美制对日‘和’约上签字的国家签字，并迫使它们同意所有的战争措施。这就是美国对苏联所提的消除紧张局势和缔结五大国和平公约的建议的答复。”
    该报最后说：“英国人民必须用行动来粉碎这些可能使战火燃遍整个远东的无耻计划，否则世界和平就将会陷于危险。”
    【新华社布拉格二十七日电】法国《人道报》于二十四日发表社论说：“美国侵略者在开城谈判期间、在会址地区所进行的一再挑衅，已使朝鲜的严重局势发展到了危险的地步。”社论接着说：“停战会议陷于停顿就是这种挑衅的第一个后果。谁也不能相信凝固汽油弹会牵涉到会议的进程中来。”
    该报指出：马立克的建议曾使美国统治集团感到狼狈。美国是在世界舆论的压力之下被迫参加会议的。因此，它“念念不忘用一切办法使谈判不能成功”。美国统治者发表杀气腾腾的言论；美方有计划地、蛮不讲理地拒绝按理可以接受的以三八线作为军事分界线的建议；李奇微故意使会议中断；美国空军加紧对朝鲜领土进行罪恶的轰炸，这一切事实都说明了：美国罪犯一刻也没有放弃过他们扩大朝鲜战争和酝酿新战争的计划。
    社论最后说：“人民的行动是可以对付帝国主义的专横和他们使用武力的手段的，人民的行动是可以使谈判的精神得到胜利的。”
