　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th. This reporter learned from the headquarters on the Korean front: The Korean armistice talks, which were adjourned for five days due to the United Nations Command raising trivial issues unrelated to the subject of the meeting, held its twentieth meeting at 12:30 noon on August 10th and ended at 4:35 pm. The twenty-first meeting is scheduled to be held at 10:00 am on August 11th. General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation, reiterated at the twentieth meeting our fair and reasonable proposal to take the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line between the two sides, and sternly refuted the other side's unreasonable demand to end the discussion of our proposal. Regarding the fact that the United Nations Command continuously violated the agreement on August 7th by first shooting at the Panmunjom neutral zone and then strafing the supply vehicles of our delegation, our delegation lodged another written protest statement to the other side at 8:20 am on August 10th. The other side's reply on August 9th was completely unsatisfactory, and it pointed out that after repeatedly violating the agreement, the other side even made slanderous remarks, which cannot but make people suspect that the other side's actions can be explained by any kind of accidental reason. The other side has not yet given a positive response to our delegation's protest on August 10th.

　　朝鲜停战谈判会议昨日复会
    我重申以三八线为分界线         
    严斥美方图中止讨论我方案的无理要求
    对美方连续违反协议再度提出书面抗议
    【新华社平壤十日电】本社记者自朝鲜前线总部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议，由于联合国军方面提出了与会议主题无关的枝节问题，而休会五天之后，第二十次会议在八月十日中午十二时三十分举行，下午四时三十五分结束。第二十一次会议定于八月十一日上午十时举行。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军，在第二十次会议上重申我方以三八线为双方军事分界线的公平合理方案，并严正驳斥对方意图中止讨论我方方案的无理要求。对于联合国军在八月七日连续破坏协议，在射击板门店中立区之后，又扫射我方代表团供应车辆的事实，我方代表团在八月十日上午八时二十分向对方再度提出书面抗议声明，对方八月九日的答复完全不能令人满意，并指出对方在一再违反协议之后，竟反而发表诬蔑性的言论，不能不令人怀疑对方的举动是用任何一种偶然的理由所可以解释的。对方对于我方代表团八月十日的抗议，迄今仍无正面答复。
