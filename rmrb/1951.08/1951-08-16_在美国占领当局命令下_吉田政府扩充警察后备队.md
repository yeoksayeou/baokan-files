　　Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: Tokyo dispatch from TASS, August 12th: August 10th marked the first anniversary of the Japanese government, under the instructions of MacArthur, ordering the organization of the so-called Police Reserve Force. In the course of this year, the Reserve Force has become a well-trained commando unit capable of being expanded into a large-scale army. The Reserve Force is composed of thirty-seven units, belonging to four divisional districts. The headquarters of the divisional districts are located in Tokyo, Sapporo, Itami (near Osaka), and Fukuoka, respectively. The Police Reserve Force is equipped with carbines, light and heavy machine guns, and armored vehicles. Many units, especially those stationed in Hokkaido, also have field artillery detachments, technical, medical, supply, and signal corps.

　　It is reported that a tank detachment has now been established, and in the near future, each unit of the Reserve Force will have a tank detachment. The units are being trained in street fighting, coastal combat, and anti-tank operations.

　　The US occupation authorities and the Yoshida government especially want to strengthen the Police Reserve Force. When Marshall visited Japan in June 1951, he, Ridgway, and Yoshida reached an agreement on strengthening the Reserve Force. The Reserve Force is to be reorganized in the American style, stationed in various places according to American strategic plans, and subject to the dispatch of the US Far East Command. On July 3rd, Ridgway summoned Yoshida and ordered him to immediately begin implementing these measures. It is reported that Yoshida assured Ridgway that the Japanese government would recruit another 10,000 "volunteers" to join the Police Reserve Force. The Japanese government has already begun reorganizing the Reserve Force and drafting plans to change the Reserve Force's equipment. Recruitment has already begun. According to Kyodo News, Reserve Force Chief Masuhara Keikichi said: Recruitment will be completed by October 1st.

　　According to the Japanese government's plan, the core of the above-mentioned recruited troops will be composed of former Japanese army officers who have regained their political rights.

　　在美国占领当局命令下
    吉田政府扩充警察后备队
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社十二日讯：东京消息：八月十日，是日本政府奉麦克阿瑟的指示下令组织所谓警察后备队的一周年。在这一年中间，后备队已经成为训练有素的突击队，能够扩大为大规模的军队。后备队由三十七个单位组成，分属四个师管区。师管区的总部分别设在东京、扎幌、伊丹（按在大阪附近）、福冈。警察后备队配备有卡宾枪、轻重机关枪、装甲车。许多单位，特别是驻在北海道的单位，并有野战炮支队，技术、卫生、军需以及信号部队。
    据悉，坦克支队现已建立，在不久将来，后备队的每个单位都将有坦克支队。各单位正在受巷战、海岸战斗、反坦克作战的训练。
    美国占领当局和吉田政府特别想加强警察后备队。一九五一年六月马歇尔访问日本的时候，他与李奇微及吉田曾获致关于加强后备队的协议。后备队要模仿美国的式样改组，依照美国的战略计划分驻各地，听从远东美军司令部的调遣。七月三日，李奇微曾召见吉田，命令他立刻开始实行这些措施。据悉，吉田向李奇微保证日本政府将再征募一万名“志愿者”参加警察后备队。日本政府已在改组后备队和草拟改换后备队的装备的计划。征募工作已经开始，据共同社消息，后备队长官增原惠吉说：征募工作将在十月一日以前完成。
    依照日本政府的计划，上述征募中的部队的核心，将由已恢复政治权利的前日本陆军军官组成。
