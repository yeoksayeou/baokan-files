    Northwest Cadres Systematically Engage in Theoretical Study

    Cadres in various parts of Northwest China are gradually launching systematic theoretical studies. From April to early July, many comrades have formulated personal study plans and begun their studies.

    Judging from their study plans, everyone can propose practical study methods based on their own work experience. Some have also determined the content of their studies based on the nature of their work, closely integrating study with work. For example, comrades in the political and legal system mostly stipulate the study of "State and Revolution"; comrades in the financial system mostly stipulate the study of "Political Economy"; comrades in Xi'an City, in order to adapt to Xi'an's economic construction work, all stipulate the study of "On Socialist Economic Construction."

    Many comrades have also conducted profound reviews of their past studies. Some comrades said: "If I had persisted in studying every day in the past, I would have done a better job and my ideological awareness would have been more advanced." Some comrades even stated: "I will never relax my study for any excuse in the future and guarantee to complete this study plan." In addition, many comrades have also put forward the guarantee of "taking notes and writing心得 (personal insights)."

    However, on the other hand, some Party organizations in some regions lack a correct understanding of theoretical study, adopt an indifferent attitude, and simply create a "name list" based on the work positions of cadres. Some even fail to produce such a "name list." Some comrades mistakenly regard grade classification as a political privilege, do not measure their own level, and try their best to participate in higher grades. However, after they participate, they do not study hard, do not submit study plans, do not submit notes, and do not abide by the study rules that a group member should abide by. These shortcomings are urgently to be overcome in the future. (Excerpt from Xi'an "Masses Daily")

    Central People's Government Directly Subordinate Organs Establish Study Tutor Research Class

    The Personnel Department of the Central People's Government established a theoretical study tutor research class in April this year to cultivate theoretical study tutors for the organs. Currently, the students in the class are seriously studying Party history. The research class is composed of more than 20 people from sixteen units including the State Council, the Ministry of Public Security, the People's Supervisory Committee, the Ministry of Culture, and the Ministry of Finance. More than half of the participants are section-level cadres. The study method is mainly self-study, supplemented by discussion and listening to reports. In the past four months, they have successively studied "Dialectics," "Historical Materialism," and "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China." During the study, the students successively listened to special reports by Comrade Yu Guangyuan on "Dialectical Materialism is the World View of the Marxist-Leninist Party," Comrade Li Shenghuang on "Dialectics," Comrade Ai Siqi on "On Practice," the Learning Cadre Conference of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on "Feudal Society and Class Struggle," and Soviet expert Afjieyev of the Chinese People's University on "Historical Materialism." This has been of great help to everyone's study. During the Party history study in July, they also listened to Comrade Qiao Mu's report, and in conjunction with Chairman Mao's articles published successively in the People's Daily since July and August, they conducted in-depth research. At present, everyone's enthusiasm for learning is very high, and they gather at the Marxist-Leninist Research Office of the Beijing Library every morning to study.

    西北各地干部有系统地进行理论学习
    西北各地干部正在逐步展开系统的理论学习。自四月份至七月初，已有不少同志订出了个人的学习计划，并开始了学习。
    从他们的学习计划来看，大家都能根据自己的工作经验提出切合实际的学习方法。有的还就自己的工作性质，确定了学习的内容，使学习与工作密切结合起来。例如，政法系统的同志，多规定学习《国家与革命》；财政系统的同志，多规定学习《政治经济学》；西安市的同志，为了适应西安市的经济建设工作，都规定学习《论社会主义经济建设》。
    许多同志并对过去的学习进行了深刻的检讨。有的同志说：“如果过去能每天坚持学习，工作一定会作得更好一些，思想意识也一定会更进步一些。”有的同志甚至表示：“今后绝不以任何借口放松我的学习，并保证完成这个学习计划。”此外，还有好多同志，更提出了“一定作笔记、写心得”的保证。
    但是，在另一方面，有些地区党的组织，对于理论学习缺乏正确的认识，采取漠不关心的态度，按干部工作职位开了一个“花名册”就算完事。有的甚至连这样的“花名册”也还开不起来。有些同志错误地视编级为政治待遇，不衡量自己的程度，尽力争取参加较高的级次。但是他们参加进去后，又不努力学习，不交学习计划，不交笔记，不遵守一个组员应遵守的学习规则。这些缺点，都是今后急待克服的。（摘自西安《群众日报》）
    中央人民政府直属机关成立学习辅导员研究班
    中央人民政府人事部为培养机关理论学习辅导员，于今年四月间即成立了一个理论学习辅导员研究班。现该班学员正认真学习党史。研究班由政务院、公安部、人民监察委员会、文化部、财政部等十六个单位二十余人组成。参加学习的科长级干部占半数以上。学习方法以自学为主，辅以讨论听报告。四个月来，已经先后学过《辩证法》、《历史唯物主义》及《中国共产党的三十年》。学习中学员们曾先后听过了于光远同志的有关《辩证唯物主义是马列主义党的世界观》、李声簧同志的《辩证法》、艾思奇同志的《实践论》、人民政协学习干事会举办的《封建社会与阶级斗争》及中国人民大学苏联专家阿芙节耶的《历史唯物论》等专题报告。这对大家的学习有很大帮助。七月份党史学习中，并曾听过乔木同志的报告，结合七、八月份以来陆续在人民日报上发表的毛主席的文章，深入研究。目前大家的学习情绪很高，每日上午均齐集北京图书馆马列主义研究室学习。
