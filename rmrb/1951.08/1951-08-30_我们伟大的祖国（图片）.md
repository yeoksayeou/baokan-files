    Our Great Motherland
    According to statistics from the National People's Armed Forces Conference last October, the number of militia armed forces not detached from production throughout our country has grown to 5.5 million. This powerful people's armed force created many moving and inspiring battle examples in the past War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. In recent years, the militia has also played a significant role in eliminating bandits, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and protecting the interests of the masses, becoming a powerful pillar for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. This is an oil painting depicting the heroic image of the militia. (Oil painting by A Lao)

    我们伟大的祖国
    我国各地不脱离生产的民兵武装，据去年十月全国人民武装会议的统计，已发展到五百五十万人。这支强大的人民武装在过去抗日战争和解放战争中创造了许多可歌可泣的战例。近年来清除土匪、镇压反革命、保卫群众利益，民兵也起了很大作用，成为巩固人民民主专政的有力支柱。这是一幅油画，表现了民兵的英雄形象。（油画、阿老作）
