Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Due to the failure of the war of aggression against Korea, internal disputes are continuing and expanding within the US reactionary ruling clique. Republican Senate leader Taft admitted that the US-launched war of aggression against Korea has been a "complete failure" and launched a fierce attack on the Truman administration. This reflects the division and chaos within the US ruling clique caused by the failure of the war of aggression against Korea, which is still continuing and expanding. Taft said at a meeting hosted by the Republican Party in Plymouth on the 29th of last month: "We have completely failed in Korea." Taft sighed that the result of the United States' atrocities in Korea for the past year is: "80,000 American soldiers have been killed or wounded (the actual number far exceeds this)," and if the Korean War ends, the United States will "still return to the same position we occupied three years ago when we withdrew our troops."

Taft saw no way out of the Truman administration's policies, and angrily called it a "troublemaking" policy. He reiterated the invasion plan repeatedly proposed by another Republican leader Hoover and himself since the failure of the war of aggression against Korea last year, advocating that the United States should rely on Britain as an accomplice to obtain "control of the world's sea and air" to promote its invasion plan, because it is hopeless for the United States to invade the peace and democratic countries led by the Soviet Union on land. He once again despairingly admitted: "We cannot wage ground wars with the Soviet Union all over the world, nor can we deal with the Communists..."

In this situation, he fiercely criticized the Truman administration's plan to spend huge sums of money to organize the North Atlantic aggressive army. He sadly admitted that the declining Western European puppet countries cannot provide much contribution to the US aggression cause, and that the US doing so will inevitably lead to serious economic consequences for itself. He particularly attacked Truman's recent statement that US government spending may reach as high as $100 billion by 1953, saying: "We cannot increase taxes for any such plan. We must admit: This means further inflation, a massive increase in national debt, hardship, riots, and damage to the various productions that constitute the backbone of our strength." After expressing serious distrust of the Truman administration, Taft called for a "rectification movement" in Washington.

### 美国反动统治集团内部因侵朝失败继续争吵  塔夫脱猛烈抨击杜鲁门政府

　　美国反动统治集团内部因侵朝失败继续争吵
    塔夫脱猛烈抨击杜鲁门政府
    【新华社三日讯】美国共和党参议院领袖塔夫脱承认美国发动的侵朝战争已“完全失败”，并对杜鲁门政府发出猛烈的攻击。这反映了美国统治集团内部由于侵朝战争失败而引起的分裂与混乱，仍在延续和扩大中。塔夫脱于上月二十九日在普利茅斯城共和党所主持的一个集会上演说时说：“我们在朝鲜完全失败了。”塔夫脱黯然叹息美国在朝鲜行凶一年以来的结果是：“美国战士死伤了八万（按实际远超出此数）”，而如果朝鲜停战，美国就将“仍旧回到我们在三年前撤出我们的部队时所占领的同一阵地”。
    塔夫脱对杜鲁门政府的政策看不到任何出路，因而愤愤地称之为“惹祸”的政策。他重申共和党另一名领袖胡佛和他自己从去年侵朝战争失败以来一再提出过的侵略计划，主张美国应该依靠英国作帮凶，取得对“全世界海空”的“控制权”，来推行其侵略计划，因为，美国要在陆地上侵略以苏联为首的和平民主国家是没有希望的。他再次绝望地承认：“我们不能在世界各地和苏联进行地面战争，也对付不了共产党人……。”
    在这种情形下，他猛烈抨击杜鲁门政府耗费巨资以组织北大西洋侵略军的计划。他悲哀地承认没落中的西欧各仆从国并不能为美国侵略事业提供多大贡献，而美国这样做却一定要招致自己经济上的严重恶果。他特别攻击杜鲁门最近预告到一九五三年时美国政府支出可能高达一千亿美元的声明说：“我们不能为任何这样的计划增加税收。我们必须承认：这意味着进一步的通货膨胀，国债大量增加，艰苦，骚乱以及那些构成我们实力的骨干的各种生产遭受损害。”塔夫脱在对于杜鲁门政府表示了严重的不信任之后，要求华盛顿来一个“整顿运动”。
