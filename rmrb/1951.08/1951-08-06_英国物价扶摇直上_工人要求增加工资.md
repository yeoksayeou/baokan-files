　　British Prices Soar
    Workers Demand Wage Increases
    [Xinhua News Agency, London, August 4th] News: The British Labour government's policy of military expansion has caused domestic prices to soar, making people's lives increasingly difficult, while capitalists are reaping ever-increasing profits from military orders.
    Since late July, the British government has announced a series of price increases for daily necessities and food almost every day. On July 20, pork sausages increased in price by 18 percent, and beef sausages by 16 percent. On the 23rd, price increases for several canned meats were announced. Starting July 30, the prices of many household textiles, including bed sheets, towels, tablecloths, etc., increased by 5 to 15 percent. On August 2, price increases for various other items were announced. At the same time, laundry prices will increase by 5 percent starting from the 4th, making laundry costs 78 percent higher than in 1939. Overall, the prices of consumer goods in Britain have increased by 25 percent compared to 1947, while workers' wages generally have not increased much compared to 1947.
    At the same time, the London monopoly capitalist newspaper "Financial Times" admitted that British capitalists' "rate of profit expansion is increasing." The newspaper stated: "According to materials published on July 14, the profits obtained by industrial companies in the first half of 1951 increased by 21 percent. Profits increased by 27 percent in May alone, and further increased by 29.5 percent in June." The newspaper revealed that British enterprises have obtained more than 900 million pounds in military orders due to the government's military expansion plan.
    The Labour government's economic policy of impoverishing the working class and profiting big capitalists has aroused increasingly strong resentment among British workers. The agenda of the upcoming annual meeting of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions clearly expresses this sentiment of British workers, with demands for wage increases occupying a major position on the agenda. This trade union federation represents nearly three million workers, including thirty-seven trade unions, and its annual meeting has therefore attracted attention from the British press. The Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Amalgamated Union of Foundry Workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union, the Electrical Trades Union, the Boilermakers' Union, the Metal Miners' Union, and many other unions have submitted proposals to the annual meeting demanding wage increases.

### 英国物价扶摇直上  工人要求增加工资

　　英国物价扶摇直上
    工人要求增加工资
    【新华社四日讯】伦敦讯：英国工党政府的扩张军备政策，使国内物价扶摇直上，人民的生活越来越困苦，而资本家从军事订货中获得的利润却有增无已。
    七月下旬以来，英国政府又几乎连日都宣布一连串的日用品和食物加价。七月二十日，猪肉腊肠加价百分之十八，牛肉腊肠加价百分之十六。二十三日，若干罐头肉类宣布涨价。七月三十日起，许多种家用纺织品包括被单、毛巾、桌布等涨价百分之五至百分之十五不等。八月二日，又有多种物品的价格宣布上涨，同时，洗衣价格将自四日起增加百分之五，洗衣费用因此将比一九三九年高百分之七十八。整个说来，英国的消费品价格已比一九四七年增加了百分之二十五，而工人的工资则一般并没有比一九四七年提高多少。
    与此同时，伦敦垄断资本家的报纸“金融时报”承认：英国资本家“利润扩大的速度正在增加”。该报称：“根据七月十四日发表的材料，各工业公司在一九五一年上半年所获得的利润增加了百分之二十一。仅在五月份利润就增加了百分之二十七，在六月份，又进一步增加了百分之二十九点五。”该报透露，英国各企业由于政府的扩张军备计划而获得了九亿英镑以上的军事定货。
    工党政府这种使工人阶级更加贫困和为大资本家牟利的经济政策，已经引起英国工人越来越强烈的愤懑。日前发表的造船与机器工会联合会年会的议程已明显地表示了英国工人的这种心情，在议程上，提高工资的要求占据主要地位。这个工会联合会代表着近三百万工人，包括三十七个工会，它的年会因此已受到英国报界的注意。混合机器工会、混合铸造工人工会、运输与各业工人工会、电气工会、锅炉制造工人工会、五金洗矿工人工会以及其他许多工会，都已向年会提出了要求增加工资的提案。
