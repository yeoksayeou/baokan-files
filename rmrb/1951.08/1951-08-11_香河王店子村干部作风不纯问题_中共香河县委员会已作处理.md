　　The Problem of Impure Work Style of Village Cadres in Wangdianzi Village, Xianghe
    The CCP Xianghe County Committee Has Taken Action
    Editor:
    The "Reader's Letters" column in the May 3rd People's Daily published a letter titled "The Work Style of Cadres in Wangdianzi Village, Xianghe County, is Impure, and the Handling of County and District Cadres Separated from the Masses is Deviant." This has been of great help to our work. Some cadres in Wangdianzi Village have an impure work style, and the county and district leaders were completely unaware of this. After the masses reported it, many district cadres still one-sidedly listened to the opinions of certain village cadres and illegally arrested Zhao Xiang, Wang Decai, Wen Fubao, and Li Shuxuan. The county committee also failed to deal with the party members who made mistakes in a timely manner. This is a bureaucratic work style that lacks a mass perspective.
    We completely agree with the handling opinions of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Tongxian Local Committee of the CCP regarding this issue; and have designated Comrade Wei Zhen, secretary of the first district committee, to make a self-criticism. Because we did not educate him sufficiently, he still adheres to erroneous opinions in some aspects. After we persuaded and educated him, Comrade Wei Zhen accepted the criticism and made a self-criticism.
    On June 16th, County Committee Secretary Zhang Ziming, County People's Government Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang Zhicheng, and Comrade Wei Zhen went to Wangdianzi Village to handle this matter. First, at the village party branch meeting, they criticized the past poor work style of party member cadres, pointing out their erroneous thinking. Then, we held a meeting with the plaintiff masses (because it was the wheat harvest season, we did not hold a mass meeting). At the meeting, we reviewed the errors of the leading organs in delaying dealing with the village's problems and illegally arresting the masses, and solicited their opinions on how to handle this issue. They requested a thorough investigation of the accounts of the firewood cooperative. We supported this request and decided to seal up the accounts of the firewood cooperative first, and then calculate them after the wheat harvest during the slack season. Certain party member cadres in the village who made mistakes, such as Lu Yucheng and Li Zhengrong, had already been punished separately during the rectification campaign in March of this year, and were not dealt with again this time. Comrade Wei Zhen, secretary of the first district committee, who one-sidedly listened to the opinions of certain village cadres and illegally arrested the masses, has been given a public warning. After education, Comrade Wei Zhen has recognized his mistakes and is determined to correct them. We have also written a written account of the process and handling of this issue and distributed it to county agency branches and various districts to conduct in-depth mass line education among cadres in order to correct the bad work style of cadres separating themselves from the masses.

### 香河王店子村干部作风不纯问题  中共香河县委员会已作处理

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　香河王店子村干部作风不纯问题
    中共香河县委员会已作处理   
    编辑同志：
    五月三日人民日报读者来信栏发表了“香河县王店子村干部作风不纯，县区干部脱离群众处理有偏差”的来信。这对我们的工作有很大帮助。王店子村某些干部作风不纯，县区领导干部对此毫无所知。当群众告发以后，很多区干部仍片面听信某些村干部的意见，非法逮捕赵祥、王德才、温福保、李树宣四人。县委对犯错误的党员，也未及时处理，这是缺乏群众观点的官僚主义作风。
    中共通县地方委员会纪律检查委员会对这个问题的处理意见，我们完全同意；并指定一区区委会书记魏珍同志进行检讨。因为我们对他的教育不够，他在某些方面仍坚持错误意见。经我们进行说服教育，魏珍同志才接受了批评，作了检讨。
    六月十六日县委书记张子明，县人民政府公安局长张志诚和魏珍同志到王店子村处理这件事。首先在该村党支部大会上批评了党员干部过去的恶劣作风，指出他们的错误思想。然后，我们又开了原告群众会议（因当时正值麦收，未开群众大会）。会上检讨了领导机关对该村问题拖延不理和非法逮捕群众的错误，并征求他们对处理这个问题的意见。他们要求清查木柴合作社的账目。我们支持这一要求，并确定先将木柴合作社的账目封存，待麦收后农闲时再算。该村某些犯错误的党员干部，如卢玉成、李正荣，在今年三月整风时已分别受了处分，这次未再作处理。一区区委书记魏珍同志片面听信某些村干部意见，非法逮捕群众，已给予当众劝告处分。魏珍同志经过教育后，已认识错误，决心改正。我们并把这一问题的经过及处理情况写成书面材料，印发县机关支部及各区，在干部中进行深入的群众路线的教育，以纠正干部脱离群众的不良作风。
