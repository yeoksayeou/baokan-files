Cadres in Hejian, Jiaohe, Qingxian and other places in Hebei Province underestimate the people's demand for democracy

Democratic construction work in Hejian, Jiaohe, Qingxian, and other places in Hebei Province has achieved considerable success. This is not only reflected in the fact that the People's Representative Conferences have inspired the people's sense of ownership and that various tasks have been completed quickly and well, but also, in particular, that the broad masses of the people have further recognized the superiority of the people's democratic system. However, there are still some problems in the province's current democratic construction work:

First, the People's Representative Conferences in many counties have not yet exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress. The reason for this phenomenon is, on the one hand, that some cadres do not realize that the People's Representative Conference is a basic system of our country and are merely satisfied with the current achievements of the People's Representative Conference; on the other hand, many comrades are immersed in economic construction and do not care about politics, thus underestimating the people's demand for democracy.

For example, several members of the Standing Committee of the Hejian County People's Representative Conference expressed extreme excitement about the fact that the People's Representative Conference of All Circles should exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress and that the people themselves should elect the county head and government members. Bai Yunzhong, a representative of the Hui people, said, "I think Hejian can exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elect the government!" He asked Bai Yupu, a representative of the business community, "What do you think?" Shi replied, "I think it's possible." The two of them simultaneously asked Comrade Wei, the county party secretary, and Wei said that he had not considered this issue. This shows that the leading departments of the county have lagged behind the demands of the masses in democratic construction work.

Hebei Province is an old liberated area. Under the long-term leadership and education of our Party, after the cruel struggle against the enemy and the large-scale production movement in the two years since liberation, especially after the recent movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the people's political and living standards have been significantly improved. Therefore, they urgently demand more democratic rights. The leading departments of various counties in Hebei should correctly estimate this objective situation and quickly meet the demands of the people.

Second, many counties confuse the People's Representative Conference with cadre meetings, with an excessive number of village cadres attending as observers, and the content of the meetings is mainly to arrange work. For example, at the first session of the first Hejian County People's Representative Conference, there were 261 representatives and 1,268 village cadres attending as observers; at the second session of the second representative conference, there were 185 representatives and 944 village cadres attending as observers. This approach is good for educating cadres and assigning tasks to cadres; however, because there are too many cadres attending as observers, it is easy to infringe on the rights of the representatives, and the handling of proposals is not serious and responsible enough, and the representatives are simply given the same tasks. This invisibly changes the nature of the People's Representative Conference. This is a major issue of principle and should be brought to the attention of all counties.

### 河北省河间、交河、青县等地干部对人民的民主要求估计不足

　　河北省河间、交河、青县等地干部对人民的民主要求估计不足
    河北省的河间、交河和青县等地民主建政工作，已获得相当大的成绩。这不仅表现在通过人民代表会议，启发了人民的主人翁思想，各种工作完成得快而且好，特别是广大人民已进一步认识到人民民主制度的优越性。但是，目前该省的民主建政工作还存在着一些问题：
    第一、许多县的各界人民代表会议尚未代行人民代表大会的职权。这种现象的造成，一方面是某些干部没有认识到人民代表会议是我们国家的基本制度，仅仅满足于现在人民代表会议的成就；另一方面是许多同志埋头于经济建设，不问政治，因而对人民的民主要求估计不足。
    例如河间县人民代表会议的几位常委，对各界人民代表会议应代行人民代表大会职权，由人民自己选举县长和政府委员一事，均表示异常兴奋。回民代表白允中说：“我看河间就可以代行人民代表大会职权，选举政府了！”他问工商界代表白玉璞：“你说怎么样？”石回答说：“我看可以了。”他们两人同时问县委书记魏同志，魏说他还没有考虑这个问题。这就说明该县的领导部门，在民主建政工作上已落后于群众的要求。
    河北省是老解放区，在我党长期的领导和教育下，经过残酷的对敌斗争和解放后两年多来的大生产运动，特别是经过最近的抗美援朝运动和镇压反革命运动以后，人民的政治水平和生活水平都已显著提高，因此迫切地要求更多的民主权利。河北各县的领导部门应该正确估计这一客观形势，迅速满足人民的要求。
    第二、许多县把人民代表会议和干部会混淆起来，列席村干部过多，会议内容主要是布置工作。如河间县的第一届一次各界人民代表会议，出席代表二六一人，列席村干部即达一二六八人；第二届第二次代表会议，出席代表一八五人，列席村干部达九四四人。这种作法对教育干部，向干部布置工作是好的；但因列席干部过多，在会上往往只见干部发言，容易侵犯代表的权利，同时对提案的处理又不够认真负责，只是同样地交一份任务给代表。这样就无形中改变了人民代表会议的性质。这是一个带原则性的重大问题，应引起各县的注意。
