The Department of Industry of the People's Government of Shanxi Province, after the notification from the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council regarding the inspection of basic construction work was issued, gave two successive instructions to its subordinate factories and mines to conduct thorough inspections based on their respective situations. It also organized two basic construction inspection teams to assist in the inspections at the Fujiatan Coal Mine and various factories in southern Shanxi. The Department of Industry instructed 42 units to conduct inspections and submit reports to the Department. However, by the end of July, only eight units had submitted reports to the Department of Industry. Some units took this inspection seriously. For example, the Flour Company, in addition to organizing company cadres to study the People's Daily editorial on "Construction is Impossible Without Correct Engineering Design" and the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee's notification, also instructed its subordinate factories to study and inspect; the Tobacco Company has already submitted a relatively good inspection report to the Department of Industry. However, many units treated this inspection with an incorrect attitude. Some people were afraid of exposing errors, and some emphasized objective difficulties, believing that the leading organs should take more responsibility. Although some of these units also conducted preliminary inspections, the central issues were not raised. For example, the Fujiatan Coal Mine had 29 basic construction projects in 1951. According to the plan, 19 of them should have been completed in the first half of the year, but in reality, only six were completed. As a result, production could not be expanded according to plan, and costs could not be reduced according to plan; and millions of catties of millet of basic construction investment were tied up. However, the Fujiatan Coal Mine did not conduct in-depth inspections in these areas, but only emphasized objective difficulties, pushing the responsibility to the Coal Mine Company (naturally the company also had responsibility), saying: "Our inspection cannot solve the problem, the Department of Industry must send people to inspect to see who is responsible!" As a result, they only conducted a simple and superficial inspection and wrote an irrelevant inspection report. Naturally, this kind of inspection cannot solve any problems. Another example is the Southern Shanxi Textile Factory, which had serious rework and waste during the construction process. The People's Daily and Shanxi Daily had criticized this, and the higher leading organs had repeatedly instructed them to conduct inspections, but the factory had not conducted strict inspections. Recently, the Department of Industry has decided to organize an inspection team led by the manager of the Shanxi Textile Company to thoroughly inspect the factory's construction work.

There were also some units that simply did not pay attention to basic construction inspection work. Most of these units believed: "Our basic construction investment here is not much, only three to twenty thousand catties of millet for construction, there is no need to inspect; even if we inspect, we won't find any problems." Half a month after the Department of Industry's instructions were issued, the responsible cadres of some units even said that they had not seen the instructions from the higher authorities. Therefore, many units did not conduct inspections at all. (Cui Jinghua, Basic Construction Department of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry)

　　山西省许多厂矿
    仍未重视基本建设检查工作
    该省工业厅组织检查组到晋南各厂及富家滩煤矿检查
    崔景华
    山西省人民政府工业厅，在政务院财政经济委员会关于检查基本建设工作的通知发出后，就根据所属各厂矿的情况，先后两次指示各单位深入进行检查；并且组织了两个基本建设检查组，分赴富家滩煤矿和晋南各厂协助进行检查。工业厅指示进行检查并须写报告给工业厅的有四十二个单位。但是，到七月底为止，仅有八个单位向工业厅作了报告。有的单位是重视这次检查的。比如面粉公司，除组织公司干部对人民日报关于没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工的社论和政务院财政经济委员会的通知进行学习外，并指示所属各厂进行学习和检查；烟草公司已经向工业厅作了较好的检查报告。不少单位却以不正确的态度来对待这次检查。有些人怕暴露错误，有些人强调客观困难。认为领导机关应该多负责任。这些单位有的虽然也进行了初步检查，但是中心的问题并未提出。比如富家滩煤矿，在一九五一年有二十九件基本建设工程，按计划前半年应完成十九件，但是实际上只完成了六件。结果，生产不能按计划扩大，成本也不能按计划降低；并且积压了基本建设投资数百万斤小米。而富家滩煤矿却没有从这些方面深入进行检查，只是强调客观困难，把责任推给煤矿公司（自然公司也有责任），说：“我们检查解决不了问题，必须工业厅派人来检查，看看到底是谁的责任！”结果只是简单浮浅地进行了一次检查，写了一个不关痛痒的检查报告。自然，这种检查是解决不了什么问题的。又如晋南纺织厂，在建厂工作中曾发生了严重的返工浪费现象，对此，人民日报和山西日报都曾予以批评，上级领导机关曾多次指示进行检查，但是该厂却一直没有进行严格的检查。最近工业厅已决定由山西纺织公司经理等组织检查组，彻底检查该厂建厂工作。
    也还有些单位根本不重视基本建设检查工作。这些单位中大多数是认为：“我们这里基本建设投资不多，三二十万斤小米的建筑，没有什么检查的必要；就是检查，也检查不出个什么问题来。”在工业厅的指示发下半月以后，有的单位的负责干部甚至说还没有看到上级的指示。因之，有不少单位根本没有做检查。（山西省工业厅基本建设处崔景华）
