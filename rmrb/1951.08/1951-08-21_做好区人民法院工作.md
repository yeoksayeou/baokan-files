　　Do a Good Job in the District People's Court
　　Wang Feiran
　　According to the instructions of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Justice of the Central People's Government, and the requests of people's representatives from all walks of life in Beijing, the Beijing People's Court successively established three district people's courts in the urban area and one district people's court in the suburban area in September and October 1950, and established trial groups within the administrative districts under the jurisdiction of each district people's court. Over the past ten months, under the correct leadership of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Justice, and the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and with the conscientious and responsible efforts of the cadres, the work of the district people's courts has achieved certain results, proving that the establishment of district people's courts in large cities meets the needs of the people.

　　First, the establishment of the district people's courts has greatly facilitated the people, enabling the people's disputes to be resolved reasonably in a simple and prompt manner. After the establishment of the district people's courts, the people can file lawsuits without leaving their district; if the initial trial cannot be resolved, an appeal to the municipal people's court can promptly obtain a final judgment, greatly saving the people's time and energy. At the same time, since the district people's courts are easier to directly approach the masses and investigate and understand the situation more thoroughly than the municipal people's court, the work efficiency has been significantly improved compared to the past municipal court: in the past, the judges of the municipal people's court concluded an average of 0.7 cases per person per day, while now the judges of the district people's court conclude an average of 1.5 cases per person per day. Therefore, the people universally support and praise the establishment of the district people's courts, saying, "The People's Government truly serves the people!" Therefore, the people request the district people's courts to resolve all disputes. Since the establishment of the district people's courts, the number of people's disputes resolved by the people's courts has increased by 52 percent compared to the past. Before the establishment of the district people's courts, the municipal people's court received an average of 1,974 cases per month; after the establishment of the district people's courts, the municipal people's court and the district people's courts received an average of 5,001 cases per month.

　　Second, the establishment of the district people's courts has changed the serious backlog of cases in the municipal people's court in the past, and has turned the work of the municipal people's court from passive to active. In May of last year, among the cases not concluded by the municipal people's court, 1,429 cases had not been concluded for more than three months; in May of this year, among the cases not concluded by the municipal people's court and the district people's courts, only 479 cases had not been concluded for more than three months, a reduction of about two-thirds. This not only enables the people's disputes to be resolved in a timely manner, but also makes it easier for the municipal people's court to concentrate on handling counter-revolutionary cases and other major cases, study policies and laws, educate cadres, improve cadres' work ability, and improve and enhance work.

　　Third, since the district people's courts are easier to directly contact the masses, more deeply understand the demands of the masses, and are also easier to be directly supervised and assisted by the masses, it is easier to destroy the reactionary judicial work conventions and create a new set of working methods for people's judicial work. In the trials, the district people's courts mostly adopted the methods of on-site trials and on-site mediation, and paid attention to propaganda and explanation work, which greatly facilitated the people and gained the support of the people. For example, when the suburban people's court issued land certificates, it sent cadres to work in the land section of the district people's government to assist in resolving the people's disputes, and held "pronouncement" meetings in the villages, using specific cases to publicize policies and laws and educate the masses. The North City District People's Court systematically conducted propaganda on the Marriage Law and held lectures on the Marriage Law, so that many women learned about the Marriage Law. When handling housing cases, it issued hearing permits so that members of the housing repair committees of various branches could take turns to attend the trials of housing cases, improve their understanding of housing policies, and invisibly added assistants to the trial work of the people's court. In addition, it explained housing policies to the masses by district. As of the end of May, a total of 13 reports were made, with more than 2,600 listeners, which was very effective. Some people started to repair houses immediately after listening to the report. In this way, the "isolated" attitude of the old judicial work was broken, and it was possible to work well in accordance with political tasks, so that the people felt that the current judicial workers were truly serving the working people and not "officials" standing on the heads of the people, and the court was truly a place for the people to handle affairs, not a "yamen where those with reason but no money should not enter." This change is the fundamental difference between the people's judicial work and the anti-people's judicial work.

　　But on the other hand, there are still many shortcomings in the work of the district people's courts, especially in terms of work style and working methods: First, due to the large number of cases and the small number of cadres, each district people's court has some backlog of cases. As of the end of May, there were a total of 2,480 cases that had not been concluded. Among them, there were 550 criminal cases that had been backlogged for more than one month and civil cases that had been backlogged for more than two months. Second, the district people's courts sometimes do not pay enough attention to respecting and protecting human rights, and have a tendency to abuse detention. Some judges say "detain them!" at every turn. Some judges put handcuffs on the parties when they do not confess truthfully. Third, some cadres have a bad work style, do not sympathize with the difficulties of the masses, and do not patiently persuade the masses. Sometimes when the masses urge the case, they blame the masses in turn, saying, "We have received a lot of cases, and you have only submitted the complaint for a week or two and you are already urging us." Individual comrades even said rudely: "I am not serving you alone." Some cadres do not conduct propaganda and explanation when pronouncing judgments, but read out the main text like reading out an "imperial decree." Some cadres still retain the airs of old judges. Fourth, some cadres lack a serious and responsible spirit in their work. They do not investigate and understand the situation thoroughly enough, and do not listen to the opinions of the parties concerned carefully enough, which sometimes leads to subjective and one-sided handling of problems.

　　In order to do a better job in the district people's court, first of all, every cadre must pay attention to their own work. The cadres of the district people's courts must stick to their posts, give full play to their initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity to improve their work and improve themselves. Do not "look up to that mountain while standing on this one," but should strive to "excel in every profession." More than 13,000 cases have been concluded in less than five months, which is a considerable achievement and a contribution of the cadres of the district people's courts to the people. However, if these cases are not handled quickly, what a great loss it would be to the people!

　　Secondly, in terms of work style and methods, pay attention to the following points:

　　(1) Contact the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and serve the people. The attitude of reactionary court officials in handling cases is "let them laugh and scold, I will be a good official." We are the servants of the people and should do more and better things for the people. The attitude of only wanting to be praised and not wanting to be criticized is not right; we should calmly and humbly consider the opinions of the masses and conduct self-examination and self-criticism. For certain important cases, that is, cases that are closely related to the vital interests of the vast majority of the people, we must thoroughly understand the demands of the masses and widely solicit the opinions of the masses before handling them; after the trial, we must also actively, widely, and deeply solicit the reactions of the masses. Only in this way can we improve our work at any time to meet the demands of the people.

　　(2) Proceed from reality. To handle each case, we should first understand the case, analyze and study it, and then handle it. Do not judge according to the articles as soon as you come into contact with the case. But solve the problem according to the essence and spirit of the articles. Only by proceeding from reality can we properly solve problems, improve our work, improve the quality of cadres, and give full play to creativity.

　　(3) Resolutely eliminate the attitude of perfunctoriness and procrastination. Reactionary judicial workers are fundamentally indifferent to the interests of the people, and therefore procrastinate and procrastinate on cases. Cadres of the people's courts are not allowed to have this style. The attitude of the people's court when handling problems should be serious, responsible to the people, and realistic. When an error occurs in the handling of a case, it should be actively corrected without waiting for an appeal, that is, re-tried and re-judged. This is in line with the spirit of "adhering to the truth and correcting mistakes," which not only does not damage the seriousness of judicial work, but also strengthens the seriousness of judicial work and enhances the prestige of the court among the masses.

　　Third, we must earnestly protect human rights and eradicate the phenomenon of abuse of detention. The basic task of the district people's court is to handle internal disputes among the people. Therefore, parties in civil cases shall not be detained unless there are very special reasons and with the approval of the superior court. As for the criminal cases accepted by the district people's court, they are generally minor. If the offender can be released on bail, he should not be detained. Detaining a party who should not be detained is an act of infringement of human rights and should be punished. The most common mistake in this regard is to confuse bad behavior with criminal behavior and punish them in the same way. We should use criminal punishment for criminal behavior, and education and criticism for bad behavior, and not sentence them to prison.

　　Fourth, continue to strengthen theoretical study, professional study, and improve policy level and work ability. The district people's courts have universally attached importance to professional study in the past six months, and have achieved significant results. For example, the work efficiency has increased from an average of 1.2 cases per person per day in February of this year to 1.5 cases in May; during the same period, the 11 cases appealed by the suburban people's court also upheld the original judgment. In learning, we must combine theory with practice, learn what we do, and mainly learn what policies are involved in many cases. In this way, "learning for use and using what we learn" will be more effective. At present, most of the cadres of the district people's courts are cadres who have not been working in the revolution for a long time and have little work experience. Adopting this learning method will make it easier to accept and apply.

　　Finally, the district people's courts now attach importance to the work of clearing backlog cases and have begun to carry it out vigorously. This is correct and necessary. Every cadre must take this issue seriously and seriously combine it with the implementation of the patriotic pact and the launch of the patriotic work competition, so that the people's internal disputes can be resolved reasonably in a timely manner to reduce the spiritual and material losses suffered by the people due to the backlog of cases.

　　做好区人民法院工作
    王斐然
    北京市人民法院根据中央人民政府最高法院、中央人民政府司法部的指示，和北京市各界人民代表的要求，在一九五○年九、十月间，先后在城区建立了三个区人民法院，在郊区建立了一个区人民法院，并在各区人民法院所辖的行政区内设立审判组。十个月来，区人民法院的工作，在中央人民政府最高法院、司法部和北京市人民政府的正确领导下，在干部认真负责、积极努力下，已经获得一定的成绩，证明在大城市中建立区人民法院是合乎人民需要的。
    第一，区人民法院的建立，大大地便利了人民，使人民的纠纷，简便而迅速地获得合理解决。建立区人民法院之后，人民不出本区即可进行诉讼；初审不能解决者上诉到市人民法院，即可及时地获得终审判决，大大地节省了人民的时间和精力。同时，由于区人民法院比市人民法院更易直接接近群众，调查了解情况较易深入，因而工作效率比过去市法院就有了显著的提高：过去市人民法院审判员平均每人每日结案○·七案，现在区人民法院审判员每人每日结案一·五案。因此人民对于区人民法院的建立普遍表示拥护，称赞，他们说：“人民政府真是为人民服务！”因此，人民把所有的纠纷统统请求区人民法院解决。自区人民法院建立后，人民法院解决的人民纠纷比过去增加了百分之五二。在区人民法院成立前，市人民法院每月平均收案一千九百七十四件；区人民法院成立后，市人民法院与区人民法院每月平均收案五千零一件。
    第二，区人民法院的建立改变了过去市人民法院严重的积案现象，使市人民法院的工作由被动转为主动。去年五月，市人民法院未结的案件中，三月以上未结者，有一千四百二十九件；今年五月，市人民法院与区人民法院未结的案件中，三月以上未结者，仅四百七十九件，约减少了三分之二。这样，不仅使群众纠纷获得及时解决，同时也使市人民法院便于集中精力来处理反革命案件及其他重大案件，研究政策法令，教育干部、提高干部的工作能力，改进与提高工作。
    第三，由于区人民法院更易直接联系群众，更深入地了解群众的要求，同时较易受到群众直接的督促与帮助，因此更便于摧毁反动的司法工作的成规，创造人民司法工作的一套新的工作方法。各区人民法院在审讯中，大多采用了就地审讯，就地调解的方式，并注意进行宣传解释工作，就大大便利了人民，并获得人民的支持。例如：郊区人民法院在发土地证时派干部到区人民政府土地科工作，协助解决群众的纠纷，并到村里开“宣判”会，通过具体案件宣传政策法令，教育了群众。北城区人民法院有系统地进行婚姻法宣传，举办婚姻法的讲座，使很多妇女知道了婚姻法。在处理房屋案件时印发旁听证，使房屋修缮委员会各分会委员轮流旁听房屋案件的审判，提高他们对房屋政策的认识，无形中等于给人民法院的审判工作添了助手。此外，并分区向群众讲解房屋政策，截至五月底，共作报告十三次，听众二千六百余人，收效很大，有的群众听了报告后，马上动工修房。这样，就打破了旧日司法工作的“孤立”的办事态度，而能很好地服从与配合政治任务去进行工作，使人民感到现在的司法工作者真正是为劳动人民服务而不是站在人民头上的“官老爷”，法院真正是为人民办事的地方，而不是“有理无钱莫进来的衙门”。这一变化，是人民司法工作区别于反人民司法工作的根本所在。
    但在另一方面，区人民法院的工作仍存在着不少缺点，尤其是在工作作风与工作方法方面：第一、由于案件多、干部少，各区人民法院都已有一些积案。截至五月底止，未结的案件共有二千四百八十件。其中，刑事案件积压在一月以上、民事案件积压在二个月以上的，共有五百五十件。第二、各区人民法院对尊重与保障人权有时注意得不够，有滥押的偏向。有的审判员动不动就说：“押起来！”有的审判员，在当事人不照实招供时，就加以手铐。第三、有些干部的工作作风不好，不体贴群众的困难，不耐心说服群众，有时当群众催案时，就反责群众说：“我们收案很多，你才递状一两个礼拜就来催。”个别同志甚至蛮横地说：“我又不是侍候你一个人的。”有的干部在宣判时，不进行宣传解释，像宣读“圣旨”一样，念完主文了事。有的干部还残存着旧法官的架子。第四、有些干部对工作缺乏严肃负责的精神。他们调查了解情况不够深入，认真听取当事人的意见也不够，致使有时处理问题主观片面。
    为了更好地做好区人民法院的工作，首先，每一个干部要重视自己的工作。各区人民法院的干部，必须坚守工作岗位，发挥主动性、积极性、创造性，以改进工作，提高自己。不要“这山望着那山高”，而应当做到“行行出状元”。在不到五个月的光景内，结了一万三千多件案子，这是一个不小的成绩，也就是区人民法院干部对人民的贡献。但是，如果不去迅速地处理这些案子，对人民该会是多大的损失！
    其次，在工作作风、方法方面，要注意以下数点：
    （１）联系群众，倾听群众意见，为人民服务。所谓“笑骂由他笑骂，好官我自为之”是反动法院官吏们处理案件的态度。我们是人民的勤务员，就该更多、更好地为人民办事。那种只愿受夸奖、不愿受批评的态度是不对的；我们应该冷静虚心地考虑群众的意见，对自己进行检查检讨。对某些重要案件，就是与最大多数人民切身利益有关的案件，在处理之前，要深入了解群众的要求，广泛征求群众的意见；审判之后，也要主动地、广泛深入地征求群众的反映。这样才能随时改进工作，以满足人民的要求。
    （２）从实际出发。处理每个案件，都应首先了解案情，分析研究，然后加以处理。不要一接触案件，就按照条文去判。而要根据条文的实质和精神去解决问题。只有从实际出发，才能妥善地解决问题，改进工作，提高干部质量，发挥创造性。
    （３）坚决肃清应付、敷衍的态度。反动的司法工作者，对人民的利益根本是漠不关心的，因而对案件推拖、敷衍。人民法院的干部，就决不容许有这种作风。人民法院处理问题时，态度应当是严肃的、对人民负责的、实事求是的。对某一案件的处理发生错误时，应不待上诉就主动地去纠正，即另审另判。这正符合“坚持真理，修正错误”的精神，不但丝毫不损害司法工作的严肃性，而且能够加强司法工作的严肃性，提高了法院在群众中的威信。
    第三，必须认真保障人权，根绝滥押现象。区人民法院的基本任务，是处理人民内部的纠纷。因此，对待民事案件的当事人，非有极特殊的原因，并得到上级法院批准时，一概不得羁押。至于区人民法院受理的刑事案件，一般都是轻微的，对于案犯只要能不押的，也不要羁押。如果把不应羁押的当事人羁押起来，就是侵犯人权的行为，应该受到处分。在这方面最容易出毛病的是把不良行为与犯罪行为混淆起来，而一样加以惩罚。我们对犯罪行为要使用刑罚，对于不良行为则应适用教育批评，而不能判刑。
    第四，继续加强理论学习、业务学习、提高政策水平与工作能力。各区人民法院半年来普遍地重视了业务学习，并已获得显著成效。如工作效率由今年二月每人每日平均结案一·二件提高到五月份的一·五件；同一时期由郊区人民法院上诉的十一个案件，也都维持了原判。在学习时，必须结合实际，作什么，就学什么，什么案件多，就主要地学习什么政策。这样“为用而学，学了就用”，收效就比较大。现在区人民法院的干部多数系参加革命工作不久的干部，工作经验很少，采取这样的学习方法，才能更容易接受与运用。
    最后，现在各区人民法院都重视了清理积案的工作，并已开始大力进行。这是正确的，必要的。每一个干部都要严肃地看待这个问题。并认真结合执行爱国公约、展开爱国主义工作竞赛来进行，使人民的内部纠纷及时地获得合理的解决，以减少人民因积案而遭受到的精神和物质上的损失。
