　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th. This reporter learned from the Korean front headquarters: The 22nd meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations was held at 10:00 AM on August 12th and ended at 11:35 AM. The 23rd meeting is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on August 13th.

　　At the 22nd meeting, General Nam Il, chief representative of the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, pointed out that the responsibility for the continued lack of progress in the talks must be borne entirely by the US side because they have consistently insisted on the absurd and arrogant proposal to draw the entire military demarcation line and demilitarized zone north of the 38th parallel within our territory, and continue to refuse to discuss our fair and reasonable proposal to establish a demilitarized zone with the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line. Based on the plan for the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone drawn by the other side on the map, General Nam Il sternly accused the other side of insisting on drawing the entire military demarcation line and demilitarized zone north of the 38th parallel within our territory, while at the same time falsely claiming in meeting speeches and official communiques that its military demarcation line and demilitarized zone plan was based on existing positions, attempting to use this means to deceive the truth and deceive the people of the world. General Nam Il pointed out that the talks cannot progress as long as the other side does not abandon its absurd and arrogant plan and seriously consider our fair and reasonable plan. The other side still avoided giving a direct answer to our stern accusations.

　　南日将军继续严斥美方荒谬方案
    美方须负会议仍无进展的责任
    指出对方一日不认真考虑我方公平合理方案，会议就一日不能获得进展。
    【新华社平壤十二日电】本社记者由朝鲜前线总部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议第二十二次会议在八月十二日上午十时举行，十一时三十五分结束。第二十三次会议定于八月十三日上午十时举行。
    在第二十二次会议上，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军指出，由于对方始终坚持将军事分界线和非军事区全部划在三八线以北我方阵地之内的荒谬狂妄方案，继续拒绝讨论我方以三八线为军事分界线以建立非军事地区的公平合理方案，因此会议仍无进展的责任，必须完全由对方负担。南日将军根据对方在地图上所画出的军事分界线和非军事地区的方案，严正指责对方一方面坚持将军事分界线和非军事地区全部划在三八线以北我方阵地之内，而另一方面却又在会议发言和正式公报中诡称其军事分界线和非军事地区的方案是以现有阵地为基础的，企图用这种手段来蒙蔽事实真相，欺骗世界人民。南日将军指出对方一日不放弃其荒谬狂妄的方案，而认真地考虑我方的公平合理的方案，会议就一日不能获得进展。对于我方的严正指责，对方仍然避免作正面答复。
