　　Since the Shanghai Jiefang Daily published the news that national agricultural labor model Zhang Fugui was unable to complete his production plan due to too many meetings, it has attracted the attention of all relevant parties; it has also generated some different opinions, and some readers do not entirely agree with the newspaper's criticism of this issue. A reader named Xiang Qun said in a letter to the newspaper: "I don't think that a nationally famous labor model like Zhang Fugui should be limited to whether his group's plan is completed or not (of course, it would be better to overcome difficulties and complete the plan on schedule). We should consider how to use his exemplary deeds and work experience to promote the entire country, because he is a national labor model. To achieve this, we must communicate his experience and deeds to the whole country through meetings and newspaper reporters, and he must also hold some important positions to play his role." In order to correct and clarify the understanding of this issue by leaders at all levels, Jiefang Daily published Comrade Xiang Qun's letter in the reader's letters column on July 16 and called on readers from all over the country to send letters to participate in the discussion. The editor pointed out in an editor's note that correcting the understanding of this issue is a prerequisite for leaders at all levels to correctly cultivate and give full play to the role of labor models.

　　After the discussion began, readers sent letters one after another to express their opinions. Generally, it is believed that labor models must first complete their own production plans. If they cannot even complete their own production plans, what "exemplary deeds" and "work experience" do they have to promote the whole country? Reader Wang Qi said: "Why did Comrade Zhang Fugui, a labor model, attend so many meetings and receive so many reporter interviews in a year? Mainly because he is a labor model and can introduce his exemplary deeds and work experience in meetings and interviews to promote the whole country. Doing so is indeed hundreds of times greater than the achievements he made in his own group. However, if Comrade Zhang Fugui cannot continue to create exemplary deeds and work experience in his own group and only stays on past achievements, what can he use to continue to promote the whole country? Of course, it is impossible." Readers pointed out, as pointed out in the newspaper's short commentary on July 9: At present, leaders in some areas do have varying degrees of "simple utilitarian views" and "formalistic leadership" on labor models, resulting in labor models having "many meetings, many concurrent positions, and many interviews," which affects their ability to have sufficient time to complete production plans and improve production technology, and even fall behind the masses. This seriously weakens the leading, backbone, and bridge role that these labor models should and can play among the masses.

　　On the 27th of July, reader Hainan further pointed out in the newspaper: This is a question about the methods of leading industrial and agricultural production and the direction of development of labor models. Therefore, this discussion cannot stop at exposing the phenomenon of "too many concurrent positions, too many meetings, and affecting production." We must study what is the direction of development of labor models, what problems existed in the past leadership's failure to cultivate labor models well, and what problems exist in leadership thinking and leadership methods; what problems do labor models themselves have in their understanding of this issue?

　　On the same day, the newspaper also reprinted an article from the Northeast Daily on July 22, "Starting from an Accounting Statistic of Han En," Han En is an agricultural labor model in Jilin Province. Last year alone, he spent more than 240 days attending meetings called by agencies above the district level that lasted more than one day and receiving visitors and investigators from all over the country; this year's situation is even more serious, because he attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, and then challenged mutual aid teams throughout Northeast China and responded to the challenge from Li Shunda's mutual aid team in Shanxi, and his reputation became even greater. From February 1st to July 1st, although there were fewer meetings, the time spent receiving visits increased, with an average of more than two cadres visiting his home for longer periods of investigation and visits every day. During this period, he was able to participate in labor for the whole day only two or three times, and that was because he had to make a film and had to show a day or a production process; secondly, he had too many concurrent positions. Han En held more than 30 positions and titles, which affected Han En's role in production and his improvement. Regarding this issue, the Jiaohe County Party Committee has made a preliminary study and decided that in the future: 1. Designate a special person to maintain regular contact with Han En and be responsible for ideological leadership, always grasp his production, work, and ideological situation, study and organize it and distribute it to various districts, newspapers, magazines, etc., and keep a copy for reference by those who come to investigate and visit. 2. Establish a labor model deeds exhibition room in an appropriate place, systematically organize and summarize Han En's historical situation, exemplary deeds, how his political awareness was improved, the process and experience of cultivating labor models, etc., and issue it to various departments that need to understand and visitors. If it is necessary to go to the site in person for a visit, it must be approved by the county party committee. After the visit, a copy of the obtained materials should be given to the county party committee for centralized control. This article is a very important reference material.

　　Currently, this discussion is continuing. In the future, it is necessary to widely organize readers from all walks of life (including relevant leading cadres at all levels and labor models from various units) to participate in the discussion, and to point out unclear and inappropriate opinions in some letters, promptly drawing readers' attention and gradually deepening the discussion.

### 一个值得各地重视的讨论

　　一个值得各地重视的讨论
    上海解放日报自从发表了全国农业劳动模范张富贵因为会议太多影响生产计划不能完成的新闻后，已引起各有关方面的注意；也产生了一些不同的看法，有个别读者不尽同意报纸对这问题所提出的批评。一位署名向群的读者给报纸的信中说：“我觉得像张富贵这样一个全国著名的劳动模范，不应只限制在他一个组的计划完成与否（当然能够克服困难按期完成计划更好），应该如何更有利的通过他的模范事迹、工作经验来推动全国，因为他是全国的劳动模范，要做到这点就必须通过会议、报社记者向全国传达他的经验与事迹来交流贯彻，也必须担任一些重要的职务，才能发挥他的作用。”为端正和明确各级领导对这一问题的认识，解放日报在七月十六日的读者来信栏发表向群同志的来信同时，号召各地读者来信参加讨论。编者在按语中指出：端正对这一问题的认识，是解决各级领导正确培养和发挥劳动模范的作用的先决条件。
    讨论开始后，读者纷纷来信发表自己的意见。一般认为：劳动模范必须首先完成自己的生产计划。如果连自己的生产计划也不能完成，他还有什么“模范事迹”、“工作经验”去推动全国呢？读者王奇说：“劳动模范张富贵同志为什么在一年中参加这么许多会和接受记者访问呢？主要因为他是劳动模范，可以在会议中、在接受记者访问中，把他的模范事迹和工作经验介绍出来推动全国。这样做确实要比他在本组所作成绩要大几百倍。但是，要是张富贵同志在本组内不能继续创造模范事迹和工作经验，而只停留在过去的成绩上，又能拿什么来继续推动全国呢？当然是不可能。”读者们指出，正如七月九日该报短评中所指出的：目前有些地区领导上对劳动模范的确存在不同程度的“单纯使用观点”和“形式主义领导”，以致造成劳动模范“会议多，兼职多，访问多”，影响到他们不能有充分的时间去完成生产计划和提高生产技术，甚至落在群众后面。严重地减弱了这些劳动模范在群众中应该发挥和可以发挥的带头、骨干、桥梁作用。
    七月二十七日报上，读者海南同志进一步指出：这是一个有关工业、农业生产领导的方法和劳动模范发展方向的问题。因此，这一讨论不能停留在对“兼职太多、会议太多、影响生产”的现象的揭露。要研究出怎样才是劳动模范的发展方向，过去领导上对劳动模范没有很好培养，在领导思想和领导方法上存在一些什么问题；劳动模范本人对这一问题在认识上又存在什么问题？
    该报同日又转载了七月二十二日东北日报上《从韩恩的一项统计数字谈起》一文，韩恩是吉林省的一个农业劳动模范，去年一年，他单是出席区以上机关所召集的超过一天的会议和接待各地的访问调查者，就占去了二百四十多天；今年的情况更严重，因为他出席了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，以后又向全东北互助组挑战，向山西李顺达互助组应战，名声更大了，从二月一日到七月一日，虽然开会少了些，但应接访问的时间却增加了，平均每日都有两个以上干部到他家作较长时间的调查和访问。这一时期中，他能整天参加劳动的只不过两三次，那还是为了摄制电影，不得不把一天或一项生产过程表现出来；其次是兼职太多，韩恩一身所兼的职务和名义共有三十多种，这种情形影响了韩恩在生产上的作用和他的提高，对此问题，现在蛟河县委已作了初步研究，决定今后：一、指定专人与韩恩保持经常联系，并负责进行思想领导，随时掌握其生产、工作、思想情况，研究整理后油印分发给各区、报纸、杂志等，另存一份供来调查、访问者参考。二、在适当地点建立劳动模范事迹展览室，对韩恩的历史情况、模范事迹、政治觉悟如何提高、培养劳动模范的过程和经验等作系统的整理总结，印发各个需要了解的部门、参观访问者如须亲到现地去，须经县委同意、访问结束后，将所得材料给县委一份，以便集中掌握。这篇文章是一个很重要的参考材料。
    目前这个讨论正在继续中，今后如何广泛组织各方面读者（包括有关的各级领导干部和各单位的劳动模范）参加讨论，并指出某些来信中不明确、不恰当的意见，及时引起读者注意并使讨论逐渐深入，是很必要的。
