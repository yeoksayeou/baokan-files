Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th – This reporter learned from the headquarters on the Korean front that the 23rd meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations began at 10:00 AM (Korean time) on August 13th and ended at 11:20 AM. The 24th meeting is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on August 14th.

Under the relentless questioning by General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, for several days, the United Nations Command delegation finally thoroughly exposed in the 23rd meeting their arrogant attempt to push the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone north of the 38th parallel and into our positions. This also revealed the deceptive nature of the so-called "existing battle line as the basis" argument made by the other side in their speeches and official communiqués. General Joy, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command delegation, claimed in the meeting that the so-called "existing battle line as the basis" plan is a plan "to use the existing ground positions as a starting point and adjust the demilitarized zone and the resulting military demarcation line northward to ensure that the United Nations Command's defense positions have adequate depth." General Nam Il pointed out that the other side's statement more clearly exposed the truth of their proposed plan, thus also explaining the fundamental reason why the meetings have made no progress since July 27th. General Nam Il reiterated that if the other side continues to insist on its absurd and arrogant plan and refuses to discuss our fair and reasonable plan to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, the responsibility for the stalled negotiations must be borne entirely by the other side.

　　在南日将军数日来不断质问下
    美方对分界线狂妄企图彻底暴露
    如果美方继续坚持其荒谬狂妄的方案会议停顿的责任
    必须完全由美方负担
    【新华社平壤十三日电】本社记者由朝鲜前线总部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议第二十三次会议，在八月十三日上午十时（朝鲜时间）开始，十一时二十分结束。第二十四次会议定于八月十四日上午十时举行。
    在朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军数日来不断地质问之下，联合国军代表团终于在第二十三次会议上彻底暴露了对方将军事分界线和非军事地区推进至三八线以北我方阵地之内的狂妄企图，从而也揭穿了对方在会议发言中，及官方公报中所谓对方方案是以现有战线为基础的欺骗言论。联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃将军，在会议中声称：所谓以现有战线为基础的方案，是“以现有地面阵地作为起点，而将非军事地区及由此而来的军事分界线向北方调整，以保证联合国军防御阵地得具有适当深度”的方案。南日将军指出：对方的声明更清楚地暴露了对方所提方案的真相，因此也说明了七月二十七日以来会议毫无进展的基本原因。南日将军再度指出，如果对方继续坚持其荒谬狂妄的方案，而拒绝讨论我方以三八线为军事分界线的公平合理方案，则会议停顿的责任必须完全由对方负担。
