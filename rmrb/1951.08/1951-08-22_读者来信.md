Readers' Letters
People's property is hard-earned; waste cannot be tolerated.
—Opinions on huge waste in construction projects and warehouse management

To the Editors:

I am glad that the People's Daily has published many reports about theft and spoilage of goods stored in warehouses, as well as huge losses and waste in construction projects. I feel that such ruthless exposure and criticism are very correct, and should be strengthened in the future; and should arouse criticism from the broad masses of workers and peasants to create public opinion. In the past, it was only administrative handling by leaders, or criticism added by the editor (which is very right), but there was a lack of mobilizing and absorbing the critical opinions of the broad masses of workers and peasants. As a result, some of those criticized could not accept it ideologically, and some, even though they made public self-criticisms in the newspaper, their degree of ideological acceptance is still a question, and may be out of necessity. Newspapers constantly expose, criticize, review, and deal with such matters, but it seems that these kinds of things still happen a lot. A little item, a grain of food, takes so much people's effort, especially the working masses of workers and peasants, and the front-line soldiers who are defending the motherland, how difficult is their situation! At a time when the motherland's finances are difficult, how low is their treatment! Workers shed so much sweat and racked their brains to produce a little item. It is even more difficult for farmers to produce a grain of food. For example, we recently had grasshoppers eating crops here (not locusts, but a kind of small grasshopper). The county and district cadres and the broad masses, regardless of the scorching sun, went out early and returned late, to rescue twenty mu of oats (according to the lean land here, it can yield up to three dan), more than 700 people fought for two days, and only saved less than half of the harvest. Several people got sick from the sun because of this, and every day there are still a few grasshoppers eating (this is only part of the tens of thousands of mu of crops being eaten). Also, many county and district party and government organs have dilapidated houses, leaking when it rains, and even a district, including the Party committee, government, people's organizations, and people's armed forces, more than thirty cadres live in only five small broken cave dwellings (like the fifth district of our county). It is difficult to obtain a little repair fee; but in the current situation of national financial difficulties, we sincerely endure it. However, many construction projects and warehouses suffer losses of hundreds of millions, tens of billions, or hundreds of billions due to improper design or careless storage. Shouldn't they be criticized? In my opinion, it is very right for them to be severely sanctioned by national law! The lower-level cadres and masses have long been full of complaints about their behavior of playing with national finances, but they cannot write well, or speak perfectly, and often drag it on. I have heard many people express such dissatisfaction in idle talk during breaks before and after meetings.

Arbitrarily transferring teachers and students to crash on central tasks seriously affects the teaching progress of schools.

To the Editors:

The People's Daily published a news item on August 6th about the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Southwest Military and Political Committee and the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee vigorously correcting the chaotic phenomenon in school work. After reading it, I deeply felt that this is indeed a problem that deserves serious attention.

As far as I know, in the Xuanzhou Special District of Southern Anhui, the chaotic phenomenon in school education is very serious. It often happens that teachers and students are transferred to crash on central tasks, which seriously affects the teaching work of schools. For example, in Shuiding Town, Xuanzhou County, last year, in order to celebrate the Spring Festival, four teachers from Shuiding Town Primary School were transferred to rush to rehearse a play for more than half a month. The teachers rehearsed until dawn every night and couldn't get up during the day, causing the school to be in a state of semi-suspension. During the autumn grain procurement last year, the district asked the teachers and students of the school to greet the farmers who collectively delivered grain with Yangko drums and horns. As a result, students carried drums and horns in class, and some even put on makeup. When the student in charge of watching reported that there were grain deliverers on the road, everyone immediately ran out, blew the drums and horns, and twisted the Yangko to welcome them. Batch after batch, more than a dozen batches had to be received every day. During the entire autumn harvest season, the school cooperated in this way, excessively delaying students' study time.

In addition, when local governments need to make registers during autumn grain procurement and other work, they routinely issue orders to gather all elementary school teachers to the district and village governments to rush to make registers. As for whether the school is still in class? No one cares at all. If teachers have any opinions, the village will threaten them by not providing food or not disbursing school funds. Therefore, the vast majority of village elementary school teachers have actually兼任兼任 the duties of clerks. Some county leaders also condone this bad style, believing that: "Central work is important, it doesn't matter if the school collapses." This is a kind of thinking that ignores long-term construction and despises school education work, and should be corrected immediately.

		Wu Yunxing, Culture and Education Section of Xuanzhou Special Commissioner's Office in Southern Anhui

Certain extracurricular activities in some primary schools in Gaoyou County, Northern Jiangsu, hinder regular class study.
The county's culture and education section has paid attention to correcting it.

In the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the primary schools in the urban area of ​​Gaoyou County, Northern Jiangsu Province, have achieved certain results in carrying out political and ideological education for children. However, some schools did not implement political and ideological education into teaching, but simply mobilized children to participate in the movement, which hindered children's regular class study. Now, the Gaoyou County Culture and Education Section has paid attention to correcting this bias.

After the donation movement was launched in Gaoyou County, Binhu Primary School did not conduct patriotic education for children through the donation movement, but simply mobilized children to sell sesame cakes and fried dough sticks on the streets to "increase production" for donations. For example, the teachers of Chengnan Primary School simply pursued donation figures and emphasized to the children: "Whoever donates more is glorious." Therefore, a certain primary school student saved the money for breakfast every day and donated it. For example, Chengzhong Primary School asked elementary school students to knock bricks (for road construction) to earn money for donations. This approach does not proceed from the actual situation of the children, nor does it conform to the principle of increasing production for donations. The effect is not great, and it affects students' learning and health. In addition, some organs and groups arbitrarily mobilize children to participate in unnecessary work, which seriously affects children's learning. For example, the Chengzhong Primary School's band has more than 20 children participating. Many larger meetings in Gaoyou County invite this band to perform. Sometimes the children are in class, and when they receive a notice, they immediately go out; sometimes they come out to perform several times a day, and sometimes they don't go home until midnight. Therefore, the children who participated in the band this semester are not keeping up with the general children in their studies, and the teachers who lead the band cannot carry out their teaching plans well. The health of children and teachers has also been seriously affected.

I think the most important thing in carrying out political and ideological education for children is to increase their enthusiasm for learning, so that they can realize that they love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, and love public property. What is described above is a serious bias. I think this bias, although it has attracted attention in Gaoyou and is gradually being overcome, may also exist in other regions. Therefore, I am telling you this situation in the hope that you will publish it to attract everyone's attention.

Bengbu Workers' Hospital disregards human life, causing a worker to die due to delayed treatment.
The relevant authorities should immediately deal with this seriously.

To the Editors:

Certain doctors at Bengbu City Workers' Hospital are irresponsible and disregard workers' lives, resulting in the death of worker Meng Xianzhang due to delayed treatment.

At noon on July 13, Meng Xianzhang, the tenth captain of the third branch of the Bengbu City Committee of the China Transport Workers' Union, accidentally slipped while carrying sacks and injured his head. After examination by a doctor at the Health Office, it was believed that "there may be hemorrhage or rupture of the head vertebra, possible internal bleeding, paralysis of the limbs, and motor nerve disorders." Because the injury was very serious, after first aid, he was sent to the Municipal Workers' Hospital by worker Wu Changai at 1:25 pm for treatment.

After arriving at the Workers' Hospital, Wu Changai registered for emergency treatment. However, Dr. Hou (the name was not specified in the letter - Editor) of the hospital actually used lunch break as an excuse and did not immediately treat Meng Xianzhang. Fifteen minutes later, Dr. Hou came out and, without detailed examination, said to Wu Changai, the escort: "It doesn't matter, take him home and rest." Wu Changai explained to him that Meng Xianzhang's injury was very serious and requested hospitalization. Dr. Hou first said that there were no rooms; Wu Changai found a room himself, but Dr. Hou said that a letter of introduction was required. Because the Transport Workers' Union and the Health Office had previously contacted the hospital by telephone and asked the hospital to provide treatment first, and then send the letter of introduction to complete the formalities; Wu Changai explained the situation to Dr. Hou and asked the patient to enter the ward first. Dr. Hou reluctantly signed, but the hospital's general affairs insisted that the formalities must be completed first. As a result, the patient did not enter the ward until the hospitalization formalities were completed. However, the hospital was still not in a hurry to treat him, saying that it was necessary to have a fluoroscopy to determine the injury before treatment. It was not until 9:00 pm that the hospital performed a fluoroscopy for the patient. After the fluoroscopy, he was still not given treatment, only saying that "there is no problem." At 12:00 at night, Meng Xianzhang felt uncomfortable and kept spitting. Wu Changai, the worker who stayed in the hospital to guard him, asked the nurse to call a doctor. Dr. Zhang (the name was not specified in the letter - Editor), who was on duty, was sleeping and said to the nurse: "It doesn't matter, just give him some boiled water." At more than 2:00 in the morning, the patient's condition worsened. The nurse went to ask the doctor again, and the doctor gave a small piece of medicine, saying that it would be fine to take it with boiled water. At about 4:30, the patient's condition was very dangerous, his breathing was rapid, and his body temperature was 41 degrees. The nurse gave an injection that was ineffective and went to ask the doctor again. The doctor still said: "It doesn't matter, let's talk about it at dawn." In this way, at 6:00, Meng Xianzhang died because the doctor was irresponsible and did not give treatment.

The Bengbu City Committee of the China Transport Workers' Union has reported this matter to the National Committee of the China Transport Workers' Union. The China Transport Workers' Union has requested the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Labor Protection Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to deal with this matter. In order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, we request the relevant leading organs to inspect the work of the Bengbu Workers' Hospital and severely punish the two doctors, Hou and Zhang.

		Yu Keqi

Editor's Note: Certain staff members of Bengbu City Workers' Hospital were irresponsible and disregarded workers' lives. They adopted an intolerable bureaucratic attitude towards the serious injury of worker Meng Xianzhang, causing Meng Xianzhang to die because he did not receive timely treatment. This incident not only shows that some staff members of Bengbu Workers' Hospital have completely lost the most basic qualities that people's medical workers should have; moreover, their behavior is already a criminal act. We suggest that the relevant authorities seriously deal with this matter and earnestly correct this bad style to avoid similar incidents from happening again.

    人民资财来处不易  不能容许随便浪费
    ——对于修建工程和仓库保管工作上发生巨大浪费的意见编辑同志：
    人民日报登载了不少关于仓库所存物资失盗、霉烂，以及修建工程上的庞大损失和浪费的报道，我感到这样无情揭发与批判是十分正确的，今后应该再加强；而且应引起广大工农群众的批评，造成舆论。过去只是领导上的行政处理，或编者加按语批评（这是非常对的），但缺乏发动与吸取广大工农的批评意见，因而有些受批评的人在思想上接受不了，甚而有些人虽在报纸上公开做了检讨，思想上接受的程度如何，还是问题，也可能是不得已而为。报纸上不断揭发、批判、检讨、处理，但发生这类事情的却似乎仍然不少。一点物品，一粒粮食，不知费了多少人的心血，特别是工农劳动群众，和为保卫祖国的前方指战员，他们是多么艰苦！在目前祖国财政困难的时候，他们的待遇是多么低微！工人为生产一点物品，流了多少汗，绞了多少脑汁。农民为了一粒粮食的生产更是艰难。如我们这里最近发生了蚂蚱吃庄禾（不是蝗虫，是一种小草蚂蚱），县区干部和广大群众，不顾炎日，早起晚睡，为了抢救二十亩燕麦（按此处地瘦，顶多打三市石），七百余人连打两天，还只救下不到一半的收成，为此事晒病的人有四、五个，而且每日还有少数蚂蚱再吃（这只是千万亩被咬庄禾内的一部分）。又如不少县区党政机关房屋破烂不堪，下雨即漏，甚而一个区，包括党委、政府、人民团体、人民武装，三十多个干部只有五间小破窑洞居住（像我县第五区）。报领一点修建费很难；但这在国家财政困难的情况下，我们是诚意忍受的。而不少建设工程和仓库，因设计不周，保管不注意，一损失就是几亿、几十亿、几百亿元之巨，他们还不应该受到批评么？依我说，受到严厉的国法制裁也是非常应该的！下边干部和群众对他们这种玩忽国家财政的行为，意见早就满肚子了，就是写不来，或说不圆满，而往往拖拉过去了。我曾听到不少人，在开会前后休息闲谈时，发出这样不满的议论。

    皖南宣城专区各地
    任意抽调师生突击中心工作  严重地影响了学校教学进程编辑同志：
    八月六日人民日报刊载了中共中央西南局、西南军政委员会以及中共中央华东局大力纠正学校工作中混乱现象的消息。我看后深深感到，这确实是一个值得严重注意的问题。
    据我了解，在皖南宣城专区，学校教育中的混乱现象很严重，经常发生抽调教师、学生突击中心工作，严重地影响了学校的教学工作。如宣城县水东镇去年为了庆祝春节，抽调水东镇完全小学四个教师赶排了半个多月的戏。教师们排戏每晚排到天亮，白天起不来，致使学校陷于半停顿状态。去年秋征时，区里要该校师生以秧歌鼓号迎送集体交粮的农民。结果学生在上课时都带着鼓号，有的甚至还化了装。当负责了望的学生报告说大路上有送粮人来时，大家马上跑出来，吹打起鼓号，扭起秧歌来迎送。一批又一批的，每天要接送十几批。整个秋征期间，学校就如此配合，过多地耽误学生的学习时间。
    此外，各地区政府在秋征等工作中需要造册子时，就照例下条子命令所有的小学教师集合到区、村政府赶造册子，至于学校还上不上课？根本无人过问。教师要有意见，村里就以不给筹粮食，不支借学校经费来要挟。因此，绝大部分地区的村小学教师事实上已兼了文书的职务。有的县领导上也姑息这种恶劣作风，认为：“中心工作重要，学校办垮了不要紧。”这是一种忽视长期建设，轻视学校教育工作的思想，应该立即纠正。
          皖南宣城专署文教科  吴运兴
    苏北高邮县某些小学课外活动妨碍正课学习
    该县文教科已经注意纠正
    苏北高邮县城区各小学在抗美援朝运动中，对儿童进行政治思想教育，有了一定的成绩。但是，有些学校没有把政治思想教育贯彻到教学中去，而单纯发动儿童参加运动，以致妨碍了儿童的正课学习。现在高邮县文教科已经注意纠正这个偏向。
    捐献运动在高邮县展开后，滨湖小学不是通过捐献运动向儿童进行爱国主义教育，却单纯地动员儿童上街贩卖烧饼油条，来“增产”捐献。又如城北小学老师单纯追求捐献数字，向儿童强调地说：“谁捐献得多，谁光荣。”因此某小学生就把每天吃早饭的钱也省下来捐献。又如城中小学要小学生敲砖头（修路用的）赚钱来捐献。这种做法不从儿童实际情况出发，也不符合增产捐献的原则。收效既不大，且影响了学生的学习和健康。此外，还有一些机关团体，任意发动儿童参加不必要的工作，更严重地影响儿童的学习。如城中小学的奏乐队，有二十多个儿童参加。高邮县很多较大的会议开会时，都要邀这个奏乐队来演奏。有时儿童正在上课，得到通知，就立刻出动；有时他们一天出来演奏好几次，甚至要到半夜才回家。因此，本学期参加奏乐队的儿童，功课都赶不上一般儿童，带乐队的教师，也不能很好按照他的教学计划进行。儿童和教师的健康也受到严重的影响。
    我认为，对儿童进行政治思想教育，最主要的应该提高他们学习的热情，使他们认识爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物，如上所述则是一种严重偏向。我想这种偏向，虽然在高邮已引起注意，并逐渐在克服着，但在其他地区，也可能有，因此我把这个情况告诉你们，希望你们发表，以引起大家注意。

    蚌埠工人医院玩忽人命  使工人因治疗延误而死
    有关机关对此应即严正处理编辑同志：
    蚌埠市工人医院某些医生工作不负责任，玩忽工人生命，造成工人孟宪章因治疗延误而死亡的事件。
    七月十三日中午，中国搬运工会蚌埠市委员会第三分会第十分队长孟宪章在扛运麻袋时不慎滑倒，头部受伤。经卫生事务所医师检查后，认为“头椎脱血或破裂，有内出血可能，四肢麻痹，运动神经障碍。”因伤势很重，急救后在下午一时二十五分就由工人吴长爱陪送市立工人医院医治。
    到工人医院后，吴长爱挂了急诊号。但该院侯大夫（来信未写明名字——编者）竟以午睡为理由，不立即为孟宪章医治。十五分钟后，侯大夫出来了，不加详细检查，就向护送人吴长爱说：“没有关系，抬回家休养休养就好了。”吴长爱向他说明孟宪章伤势很重，要求住院。侯大夫先说是没有房间；吴长爱自己找到了房间，侯大夫又说是要介绍信。因为搬运工会及卫生事务所事先已用电话和院方洽商过，请医院先行医治，随后就送介绍信来办手续；吴长爱就向侯大夫说明情况，要求先让病者进病房。侯大夫勉强签了字；但该院总务却又坚持必须先办手续。结果，还是等办好住院手续后，病人才进入病房。但院方仍不急予治疗，说要等透视后，断定伤情，才能医治。一直拖到午后九时，院方才为病人透视，透视后仍不予诊疗，只说是“没有问题”。夜间十二点，孟宪章心中难过，吐痰不止。留院守护工人吴长爱找看护请大夫。值班医师张大夫（来信未写明名字——编者）正在睡觉，竟向看护说：“没有关系，给他喝点白开水就好了。”深夜二点多钟，病人病情更重。护士再去请大夫，大夫给了一小片药，说是用开水送下就好了。四点半光景，病人病情十分危险，呼吸迫促，体温四十一度。护士打了一针无效，又去请大夫。大夫仍说：“没关系，到天亮再说。”这样，到六点钟，孟宪章终因大夫不负责任、不给治疗而死亡。
    中国搬运工会蚌埠市委员会已经把这件事报告中国搬运工会全国委员会。中国搬运工会已要求中央人民政府卫生部及全国总工会劳动保护部处理这件事。为了使今后不再发生类似事件，我们要求有关领导机关检查蚌埠工人医院工作，并给侯、张两个大夫以严厉处分。
            于克崎
    编者按：蚌埠市工人医院某些工作人员工作不负责任、忽视工人生命，对工人孟宪章的重伤，采取了令人不能容忍的官僚主义态度，使孟宪章因得不到及时医治而死亡。这件事情不但说明了蚌埠工人医院的某些工作人员，已经完全丧失了人民医务工作者应有的最起码的品质；而且他们这种行为已经是一种犯罪行为。我们建议有关机关严正处理这件事，切实纠正这种不良作风，以避免今后再有类似事件发生。
