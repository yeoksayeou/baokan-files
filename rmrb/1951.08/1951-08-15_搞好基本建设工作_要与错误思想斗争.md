    To Do a Good Job in Basic Construction, It Is Necessary to Fight Against Erroneous Ideas
    Some people believe that the failure of basic construction projects in the past was mainly due to many objective reasons. This view is wrong. We believe that objective factors are only a possibility for making basic construction work not successful, but not the main determining factor. These possibilities can be overcome one by one through subjective efforts. For example, in our factory, the newly built factory building was found to have insufficient frame load as soon as it was built; the newly built kiln body was found to have cracks in less than half a year, and the kiln body bricks subsided; another example is that there were many problems in the design of the carbolic acid project, which resulted in the stagnation and backlog of funds amounting to 6 billion RMB. Are these shortcomings all caused by objective reasons? Are they all beyond human ability to overcome? No, absolutely not. With a little more effort, these can all be avoided. Therefore, we say that the basic reason for the failure of basic construction projects in the past two years is the insufficient subjective effort of the staff. After studying the People's Daily editorial "Construction Is Impossible Without Correct Design," we believe that the following erroneous ideological consciousnesses must be corrected:
    First, the tendency to be grandiose and eager for success, blindly accepting tasks, thinking that the more tasks assigned by the higher authorities, the more glorious it is; after accepting tasks, they rarely analyze the objective situation, and rely on subjective hard work, resulting in a lot of effort without doing the work well.
    Second, relying on subjective narrow experience, thinking that it is okay to do the same way as in the past. For example, some comrades have been engaged in bleaching powder projects in the south and paid great attention to freezing. But when they arrived in the Northeast, they still emphasized freezing, without paying attention to the low temperature in winter. This proves that it is impossible to follow the old ways without understanding the different surrounding environments.
    Third, the "masterpiece" mentality is very strong, thinking that "there will be no mistakes in construction according to my drawings," and not humbly listening to other people's opinions.
    Fourth, the overall concept is not strong, and everyone does their own thing. Civil engineering and construction personnel engage in civil engineering and construction, electrical engineering personnel engage in electrical engineering, and chemical engineering personnel engage in chemical engineering. The house is designed too low, the large tank cannot be installed, and the heating package is not in the right position. They do not contact each other in advance and do not study each other. When problems arise, they do not seek solutions but blame each other, you look down on me, and I look down on you, which hinders the progress of the work.
    Fifth, working with a mercenary point of view, lacking a clear and firm idea of serving the people. "How much money you take, how much work you do." They want to take credit for achievements, want to hide loopholes, report good news but not bad news, and lack a sense of responsibility.
    Of course, these ideological situations are not present in everyone, and many engineering and technical personnel are actively responsible for their work and have made great contributions. However, we realize that if a few people have these incorrect ideological consciousnesses, it will affect the work. Therefore, we must wage a resolute struggle against these erroneous ideas and completely eliminate them.
    In order to better carry out basic construction work and improve work efficiency, we have the following suggestions:
    (1) Strengthen political education, improve political awareness, and enable every engineering and technical personnel to establish a correct view of serving the people. (2) Strengthen the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and learn to master the situation and analyze the situation. (3) Concentrate the strength of designers, organize them into a strong design institution, and specialize in design work, overcoming the past "cook and groom" guerrilla phenomenon. (4) Step up the training of reserve forces to meet the great construction upsurge.

### 搞好基本建设工作  要与错误思想斗争

    搞好基本建设工作  要与错误思想斗争
    有些人认为过去的基本建设工程没有搞好，主要是由于许多客观原因所造成的。这样的看法是错误的。我们认为：客观因素，只是使基本建设工作搞不好的一个可能性，而不是主要的决定因素。这些可能性要是经过主观的努力，是可以一一克服的。譬如我们厂里的新建厂房，刚造好即发现房架负荷不够；新建的窑身，不到半年即发现有裂缝，窑身砖下沉；又如石炭酸工程设计中的问题很多，因而中途停顿积压资金达人民币六十亿之多。这些缺点难道都是客观原因所造成的吗？难道都是人力所不能克服的吗？不，绝不，只要多努把力，这些都是可以避免的。所以我们说，二年来基本建设工程没有搞好的基本原因，是工作人员的主观努力不够。我们学习了人民日报《没有正确设计就不可能施工》的社论之后，认为有下列几个错误思想意识必须纠正：
    一，好大喜功，盲目接受任务，以为上级交给我的任务愈多愈光荣；接受了任务之后，也很少分析客观情况，凭主观硬干，结果费了很大的劲儿而没有把工作做好。
    二，凭主观狭隘经验，以为过去搞过一套现在照这样干就行。如部分同志曾在南方搞漂粉工程，很注意冷冻。但到了东北仍强调冷冻，而未注意冬季温度低。由此证明，不了解周围环境的不同，搬老一套是搞不通的。
    三，“杰作思想”很浓，认为“照我的图纸施工总不会错”，不虚心听取别人的意见。
    四，整体观念不强，各搞各的一套。土木建筑人员搞土木建筑，电气工程人员搞电气工程，化学工程人员搞化学工程。房子设计太低了，大罐装不下，暖气包装不到合适的位置。事先不联系，不互相研究。等出了问题，不求解决反而互相埋怨，你瞧不起我，我瞧不起你，以致妨碍了工作的进展。
    五，用雇佣观点做工作，缺乏明确的坚定的为人民服务的思想。“拿多少钱，做多少事。”有了成绩想称功，出了漏子想隐瞒，报喜不报忧，责任感不够。
    这些思想情况当然不是人人都有，并且有很多工程技术人员对工作积极负责，有了很大的贡献。然而我们认识到，要是有少数人存在这些不正确的思想意识，就会影响工作。因此，我们必须向这些错误思想作坚决的斗争，彻底消灭它们。
    为了更好地开展基本建设工作，提高工作效率，我们有下列建议：
    （１）加强政治教育，提高政治认识，使每个工程技术人员树立起为人民服务的正确观点。（２）加强马列主义毛泽东思想的理论学习，学习能掌握情况，分析情况。（３）集中设计人员的力量，组织成强有力的设计机构，专门从事设计工作，克服过去“伙夫兼马夫”的游击现象。（４）加紧培养后备力量，迎接伟大的建设高潮。
