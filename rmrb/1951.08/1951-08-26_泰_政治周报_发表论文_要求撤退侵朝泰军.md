Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, August 23rd: The Thai-language "Political Weekly" recently published an article in its latest volume, issue 23, exposing how the reactionary government of Thailand's Plaek Phibunsongkhram, by dispatching troops to act as accomplices in the U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea, has caused significant losses to the Thai people in both lives and property. According to the publication's calculations, in the nine months since the Plaek Phibunsongkhram government participated in the Korean War, Thailand's military expenditure has reached 300 million baht (approximately $14 million USD), including the operational expenses of the Korean "expeditionary force" and the materials transported to the U.S. troops in Korea. By March of this year, the Thai government had delivered 40,000 tons of rice to the U.S. military, valued at 80 million baht. The United States has also requested Thailand to supply 35,000 tons of timber and 20,000 tons of rice.

The publication cited an official Thai statement saying that the 1,200 troops Thailand sent to Korea had been reorganized from a mixed regiment into a battalion due to casualties and attrition; however, a battalion only has a quota of 400 personnel.

After summarizing the losses Thailand has suffered in the past year, the publication demanded the withdrawal of Thai troops from Korea.

The publication went on to criticize the reactionary Thai government for supplying large quantities of military supplies to the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit army's 93rd Division, who were roaming the Thai-Burmese border, and exposed the Thai government's conspiracy to interfere in the Vietnam War.

The publication concluded by calling on every peace-loving person to stop the wars of aggression against Korea and Vietnam.

　　泰“政治周报”发表论文
    要求撤退侵朝泰军
    【新华社二十三日讯】曼谷消息：泰文“政治周报”最近在新一卷第二十三期发表一篇论文，揭露泰国銮披汶反动政府派遣军队充当美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的帮凶后，已使泰国人民在生命和财产上受到重大损失。据该报计算，在銮披汶政府参加侵朝战争的九个月中，泰国的军事费用已支出三亿铢（约合一千四百万美元），其中包括朝鲜“派遣军”的作战费和运送给侵朝美军的物资。到今年三月为止，泰国政府已运交美军价值八千万铢的大米四万吨。美国还要求泰国供应木材三万五千吨和大米二万吨。
    该报引证泰国官方的声明说：泰国派赴朝鲜的一千二百名军队，由于伤亡减员，已由混合团改编为营；而营的兵员名额只有四百名。
    该报在总结一年来泰国所受的损失后，要求撤回泰国在朝鲜的军队。
    该报继指责泰国反动政府以大批军火接济流窜泰缅边境的国民党匪军第九十三师残部，并揭露泰国政府准备干涉越南战争的阴谋。
    该报最后号召每个爱好和平的人士制止侵略朝鲜和侵略越南的战争。
