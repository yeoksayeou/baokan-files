To the Volunteer Army
    We Cannot Let Our Dearest Lack Spiritual Food

Respected Volunteer Army Comrades:

    Today, I saw in the newspaper your army post distribution department's letter and the commentary in the "Resist America, Aid Korea Special Issue," and I learned that you are also seizing the gaps in the war to study culture and politics, but there is a lack of books and newspapers at the front, and you are not getting the spiritual food you deserve. I feel extremely sad.

    We are students in school, and today we can have a comfortable learning environment, study with peace of mind, go to the library and the laboratory every day, and have whatever books we want to read. All of this, if it weren't for you bravely fighting the American aggressors at the front, without fear of hardship or sacrifice, and defending our beloved motherland, would it be possible? You are shedding blood and sweat at the front for the safety of the people of the whole country, for our safety, but you don't have enough spiritual food. The more I think about it, the more ashamed I feel, the more uneasy I feel – can we let our dearest people lack sufficient spiritual food? No, we cannot! I want to use my greatest strength to support my dearest people. I have saved a little money (168,000 yuan) over the past few months and subscribed to ten copies of the "Study" magazine's elementary edition (half a year each), and I ask the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association to forward them to you.

    At the same time, I guarantee that I will study harder, exercise my body, and prepare to respond to the call of the motherland, and I guarantee to do a good job in increasing production and donating airplanes and cannons during the summer vacation to support you.

With the highest respect!

　　写给志愿军
    不能让我们最亲爱的人缺乏精神食粮敬爱的志愿军同志们：
    今天我在报上看见了你们军邮发行股的来信和《抗美援朝专刊》的时评，知道你们在前方还抓紧战争空隙学文化、学政治，但是前方缺乏书报，你们得不到应有的精神食粮。我心里难过极了。
    我们是在学校里念书的，今天能够有舒适的学习环境，安心地学习，每天上图书馆、上实验室，爱看什么书就有什么书。这一切，如果不是有你们在前方英勇地打击美国侵略军，不避艰苦、不避牺牲，保卫着我们可爱的祖国，这可能吗？你们为了全国人民的安全，为了我们的安全，在前方流血流汗，却没有足够的精神食粮。我愈想愈觉得惭愧，愈想愈觉得不安——我们能使我们最可爱的人没有足够的精神食粮吗？不能，不能！我要用我最大的力量支援我最可爱的人。我把我几个月来节省下来的一点钱（十六万八千元），订了十份“学习”杂志初级版（每份半年），请抗美援朝总会转交你们。
    同时，我保证要更加努力学习，锻炼身体，准备响应祖国的号召，并保证做好暑假期内增产捐献飞机大炮的工作，来支援你们。此致最崇高的敬礼！
