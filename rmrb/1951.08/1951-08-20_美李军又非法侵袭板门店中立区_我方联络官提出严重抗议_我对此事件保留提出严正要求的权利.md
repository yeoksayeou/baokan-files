Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 19th: Our special correspondent reports: On the morning of August 19th, the U.S.-Syngman Rhee bandit troops violated the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement for the third time, attacking our Panmunjom area. This incident was more serious than the previous two. Approximately several dozen U.S.-Syngman Rhee troops illegally invaded the neutral zone and fired upon our patrol personnel, resulting in one fatality and one injury on our side. Our liaison officer has lodged a serious verbal protest with the U.S. liaison officer regarding this incident.

The details of the incident and the investigation results are as follows: At 5:00 AM on the 19th, a squad of our military police force, totaling nine men, led by platoon leader Yao Qingxiang and deputy platoon leader Li Jinglin, patrolled eastward along the ridge of Zengshandong, Songguli, and Boshanli, approximately two kilometers southwest of Panmunjom in the Kaesong Neutral Zone. At approximately 5:50 AM, while traversing the mountain path between Songguli and Boshanli, near the western slope of a high ground, they were suddenly attacked by several dozen U.S.-Syngman Rhee bandit troops who had illegally invaded the neutral zone and were ambushed in advance at the southern end of the high ground and in the forest. At 5:57 AM, platoon leader Yao Qingxiang and soldier Wang Renyuan were simultaneously shot in the upper left thigh and wounded. Platoon leader Yao collapsed to the ground due to serious injuries and could not move. Under the heavy fire of the enemy troops, the remaining personnel retreated without firing a single shot. After the enemy troops occupied the high ground, they shot platoon leader Yao Qingxiang twice in the forehead, killing him. At that time, the already wounded soldier Wang Renyuan had crawled and hid in a haystack and was spared discovery. The enemy troops then withdrew to the highlands north of Baitongyinli.

After receiving this report at 8:00 AM, our delegation notified the U.S. delegation's liaison officer at 8:30 AM, informing them of the violation of the neutral zone and requesting that the other party send personnel to conduct an immediate joint investigation. The liaison officers of both sides agreed to meet at Panmunjom at 8:50 AM. At 9:00 AM, the liaison officers of both sides (Colonel Murray arrived on the other side, leading three translators; Colonel Zhang and Lieutenant Colonel Chai arrived on our side, leading two translators) met near the Panmun Bridge. After briefly discussing the incident, they proceeded to Boshanli, Baitongyinli, and the scene of the incident for an on-site investigation.

Based on the on-site investigation, it was proven that the U.S.-Syngman Rhee troops did illegally invade the neutral zone around dawn on August 19th and planned an attack on our patrol police in the neutral zone. Due to the conclusive evidence, the other party's liaison officer, Colonel Murray, could not deny the authenticity of the physical and testimonial evidence of the attack. At 12:50 PM on the same day, the joint investigation concluded. Before the conclusion, our liaison officer lodged a serious verbal protest with the other party's liaison officer regarding the incident, and stated that our delegation reserves all rights to raise formal demands regarding the serious incident of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee troops disrupting the Kaesong Neutral Zone, attacking our patrol troops, shooting and killing Yao Qingxiang, and wounding Wang Renyuan.

　　美李军又非法侵袭板门店中立区
    我方联络官提出严重抗议
    我对此事件保留提出严正要求的权利
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者报道：八月十九日晨，美李匪军第三次违反开城中立区协议，向我板门店地区袭击。此次事件较过去两次更为严重。约有美李军数十人非法侵入中立区，向我巡逻人员射击，以致我方巡逻人员有一人牺牲，一人负伤。我方联络官已就此事件向美方联络官提出口头严重抗议。
    此次事件的经过及调查结果如下：十九日晨五时，我方军事警察部队一个班共九人，由该班所属排长姚庆祥、副排长李景林率领，在开城中立区板门店西南约两公里处，沿甑山洞、松谷里、钵山里山岭向东巡逻，于五时五十余分左右行至松谷里与钵山里之间山道附近的高地西坡，被非法侵入中立区事先埋伏于该高地南端及林中的美李匪军数十名突然袭击。五时五十七分，排长姚庆祥、战士王仁元两人左大腿上部同时中弹负伤，姚排长因伤重卧倒在地，不能移动，其余人员在敌军猛烈射击下，未还一枪，即向后撤。敌军进占该高地后，将负伤之姚排长前额加击两枪毙命。当时，已负伤之战士王仁元已爬行躲藏于草堆内，未被发现，得以幸免。敌军旋撤至白冬音里以北高地一带。
    我方代表团于八时接获此项报告后，即于八时半通知美方代表团联络官，告以对方有违反中立区事件，要求对方派员共同立即进行调查。双方联络官约定于八时五十分在板门店晤见。九时正双方联络官（对方穆莱上校到场，率领翻译三人，我方由张上校及柴中校到场，率领翻译二人）在板门桥附近会晤，略谈事件经过后，即赴钵山里、白冬音里及出事地点进行实地调查。
    根据实地调查所得，证明美李军确于八月十九日拂晓前后非法侵入中立区，并有计划地袭击中立区我巡逻警察。因证据确凿，对方联络官穆莱上校亦无法否认此次袭击事件之物证人证的真实性。同日十二时五十分，双方共同进行的调查结束。在结束前，我方联络官当场向对方联络官就该事件提出口头严重抗议，并声明我代表团保留对此次美李军破坏开城中立区袭击我方巡逻部队、枪杀姚庆祥、打伤王仁元的严重事件提出严正要求的一切权利。
