Reader's Letters

　　Learning Rights of Honored Veterans Should Not Be Deprived Based on Disability
　　Comrade Editor:
　　I am a revolutionary disabled soldier who lost a leg in the war, and I am currently working in the Labor and Wages Department of the Forest Industry Bureau of the Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry. I have a problem that I hope you can help resolve.
　　During this year's school enrollment, revolutionary cadres and industrial workers were given special consideration. Many comrades of worker or peasant origin are very excited and determined to strive to become new-type intellectuals under the Party's cultivation, so as to better serve the people.
　　Recently, Renmin University of China wanted various government agencies to recommend cadres for admission, requiring students to have only the equivalent of a junior high school education. I was excited and applied to the personnel department of our agency. When Comrade Liu Zhenying, who was sent by Renmin University to the Northeast for enrollment, arrived at our bureau, the head of our bureau's personnel department told Comrade Liu Zhenying about my sincere request to study. After Comrade Liu Zhenying understood all my circumstances, he said: "All conditions are met; but one leg is artificial, which won't work!" When I heard this news, it was like being doused with cold water, and my enthusiasm vanished instantly, leaving me feeling very uncomfortable.
　　Comrade Editor: I really don't understand why a revolutionary disabled soldier who exchanged a leg for the defense of the country is even deprived of the right to study at school?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wu Yi, Labor and Wages Department, Forest Industry Bureau, Northeast Department of Agriculture and Forestry

　　Editor's Note: We believe that it is unreasonable for Comrade Liu Zhenying, who was sent by Renmin University of China to the Northeast for enrollment, to refuse Comrade Wu Yi's admission on the grounds that "one leg is artificial." Obviously, the fact that Comrade Wu Yi has an artificial leg will not affect his studies at Renmin University. Moreover, Comrade Wu Yi is a revolutionary disabled soldier, and his leg was disabled for the cause of the people's revolution. We hope that Renmin University of China will investigate and deal with this matter and re-examine Comrade Wu Yi's admission conditions.

　　Beijing Labor Bookstore Should Not Reprint Important Documents Without Authorization
　　Comrade Editor:
　　Earlier this month, I saw a reprinted copy of "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" in Xidan Department Store. The copyright page did not indicate the publishing bookstore, but only stated: "Based on the August 1949 reprint by Xinhua Bookstore of North China, No. 14, Southwest Garden, West Liulichang." I bought a copy and found that there were more than a dozen errors in the proofreading, and some sentences even changed the original meaning due to omissions or misprints. I believe that the reprinting of such important document-like works should be strictly prohibited to avoid errors. I suggest that the Beijing Municipal Publishing Administration should thoroughly investigate the reprinter of this book and publish the handling process in the newspaper.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yu Wen

　　Editor's Note: The Beijing Municipal Press and Publication Bureau discovered this matter in late June; the Xinhua Bookstore Main Store also sent a letter to the bureau in early July to report and request handling. After investigation by the bureau, it was clear that the reprinter of this book was the Beijing "Labor Bookstore," and the reprinting time was between April and June of this year. The predecessor of "Labor Bookstore" was "Guanghua Publishing Department," which had reprinted various books published by the Liberation Press after the liberation of Beijing. After being advised, it published a statement in the newspaper in September 1949 guaranteeing not to repeat similar errors. Therefore, the Beijing Municipal Press and Publication Bureau has ordered the store to thoroughly investigate and deal with it.

　　File Reprints Should Be Carefully Proofread
　　(I) Comrade Editor:
　　Recently, in order to study Chairman Mao's "Foreword to 'The Communist'," we found the book "The Tasks of the Chinese Communists" (collection, first edition in July 1949) published by Xinhua Bookstore, Southern Jiangsu Branch. We found that there were errors and omissions in the article collected in it, so we looked for another copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" (May 1948 Harbin edition) published by Northeast Bookstore for comparison. We found that the former, in addition to omitting general words such as "thoroughly," "with," and "of," also had important omissions in sentences, such as the omission of the second "not" in the sentence "Its development and consolidation cannot but be linked to the Party's relationship with the bourgeoisie and the Party's relationship with armed struggle." As for errors and omissions in punctuation, there were almost in every paragraph.
　　I suggest that local people's publishing houses conduct a comprehensive inspection of publications.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wu Genglie

　　(II) Comrade Editor:
　　There are many proofreading errors and important omissions in "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" written by Comrade Hu Qiaomu, reprinted by the Jianmen Newspaper of Sichuan Province. For example, the quotation marks for the word "left" in "left" opportunism are omitted, the quotation marks for the sentence "Why can China's red regime exist?" are omitted, and the book title "Mass Movement in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas" is missing the word "Areas". After pointing out that Mao Zedong's "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" "is one of the most outstanding Marxist military works in the world communist movement", Hu's book goes on to explain that "Moreover, the significance of this book goes far beyond purely military issues." However, the reprint mistakenly changed "Moreover" to "But." Other errors include changing "appropriate" to "practical", and changing "streamlining administration and reducing staff" to "streamlining administration and reducing staff": these are more important errors.
　　I hope you will publish this letter of mine to draw the attention of publishing authorities in various places.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Liu Tengjiao

　　Editor's Note: The situations and opinions reflected by Comrades Wu Genglie and Liu Tengjiao deserve the serious attention of state-owned and private book and periodical publishing agencies in various places. In document-like works, there cannot be a single error or omission in a word, or even a symbol or punctuation mark.

    不应以残废为理由剥夺荣誉军人的学习权利编辑同志：
    我是一个在战争中丢掉一条腿的革命残废军人，现在在东北人民政府农林部森林工业总局工作。我有一个问题，希望你能帮助解决。
    这次各学校招生时，都对革命干部及产业工人加以照顾。很多工人或农民出身的同志都很兴奋，决心要争取在党的培育下做一个新型的知识分子，以便更好为人民服务。
    最近，中国人民大学要各机关保送干部入学，对学生文化程度只要求有相当于初中程度。我就兴奋地向我们机关的人事处报了名。当人民大学派来东北招生的刘振英同志到我局后，我局人事处长便将我恳切要求学习的情形告诉了刘振英同志。刘振英同志把我的全部情形了解后，说：“什么条件都够；但一条腿是假腿，不行！”我听到这个消息，像被冷水浇头一样，满腔热情顿时化为乌有，心里十分难受。
    编辑同志：我实在不明白，一个为保卫国家而换来一条假腿的革命残废军人，为什么连到学校学习的权利也被取消了呢？
        东北农林部森林工业总局劳动工薪处  吴毅
    编者按：我们认为，中国人民大学派往东北招生的刘振英同志以“一条腿是假腿”为理由而拒绝吴毅同志入学，这是不合理的。很明显，吴毅同志有一条腿是假腿，并不会影响在人民大学学习。何况吴毅同志是个革命残废军人，他的一条腿是为人民革命事业而残废的，希望中国人民大学检查处理这件事情，重新审核吴毅同志的入学条件。
            北京劳动书店不应擅行翻印重要文件编辑同志：
    本月上旬，我在西单商场看到一本《中国革命与中国共产党》的翻印本，版权页上没有注明出版书店，上面只是写着：“依据华北新华书店一九四九年八月再版本西琉璃厂西南园十四号”。我买了一本回来，发现其中有十几处校勘上的错误，甚至有的文句因为漏字或错字，而把原来的内容文义改变了。我以为对这种重要的文件性著作，应该严格禁止翻印，以免发生错误。我建议北京市的出版管理机关应该切实查明此书的翻印者，并将处理经过在报上公布。
                        于文
    编者按：此事已经北京市新闻出版处在六月下旬发觉；七月初新华书店总店也曾去信该处检举并要求处理。经该处调查清楚：此书的翻印者是北京“劳动书店”，翻印时间是在本年四月至六月间。“劳动书店”的前身是“光华出版部”，在北京解放后曾翻印解放社出版的多种书籍，经劝告后，曾在一九四九年九月登报声明保证不再犯同类错误。因此北京市新闻出版处已令该店切实检查处理。
            翻印文件性著作要认真校勘
    （一）编辑同志：
    我们最近为了学习毛主席写的《共产党人发刊词》，找到新华书店苏南分店出版的《中国共产党人的任务》（文集，一九四九年七月初版）一书。我们发觉里面收集的这一篇文章有错漏，便另去找一本东北书店出版的《毛泽东选集》（一九四八年五月哈尔滨版）对照一下，发觉前者除了脱漏一般的字如“彻底”、“与”、“的”等以外，并且有重要文句的遗漏，如“它的发展与巩固，都不能不联系于党同资产阶级的关系与党同武装斗争的关系”一句中的第二个“不”字也漏了。至于标点的错漏，几乎每段都有。
    我建议各地人民出版社对出版物作一次全面的检查。
          吴耿烈
    （二）编辑同志：
    四川省剑门报社所翻印的胡乔木同志著的《中国共产党的三十年》，里面有不少校勘错误和重要脱漏。如“左”倾机会主义的左字遗漏了引号，“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”一句遗漏了引号，《国民党统治区群众运动》一书书名漏了一个“区”字。胡书在指出毛主席的《中国革命战争的战略问题》一书“是世界共产主义运动中最优秀的马克思主义的军事著作之一”后，接着说明“而且这部书的意义远超于单纯的军事问题以外。”，而翻印本却把“而且”错成“但是”。其他如把“切合时宜”错成“切合实宜”，把“精兵简政”错成“精兵减政”：这些都是较重要的错误。
    我希望你们把我这封信发表，以引起各地出版机关的注意。
          刘腾蛟
    编者按：吴耿烈、刘腾蛟两同志所反映的情况和意见值得各地国营和私营书刊出版机关严正注意。在文件性著作中，不能容许有一个字、甚至一个符号和一个标点的错误和脱漏。
