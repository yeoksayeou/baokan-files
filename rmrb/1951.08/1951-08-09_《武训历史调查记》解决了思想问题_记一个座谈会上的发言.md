　　"The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" Solved Ideological Problems
    ——A Speech at a Symposium

    Editor's Note: The publication of "The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" has attracted the attention of a wide readership across the country. The Northeast Daily recently invited figures from the education and cultural circles of Shenyang to discuss their thoughts and gains after reading this investigation. This article is a record of that symposium.

　　The Motives of Wu Xun in Promoting Education Were Fundamentally Not Good

    The participants unanimously reflected that, before the publication of "The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," many people had not truly resolved the issue of Wu Xun's motives for promoting education in their minds. Shen Yu-hong, a teacher at the Shenyang Municipal Sanjing Road Elementary School, reflected: Some people admitted that his "free school" actually served the landlord class, but believed that Wu Xun's motives for promoting education were good. Some said his motives were also bad, but lacked sufficient evidence. Moreover, some people thought Wu Xun's motives for promoting education were good and therefore excused his land exploitation and usury, believing that "no matter how he exploited the working people, his purpose was for poor children." When speaking about their views on this issue before the publication of "The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," Tie Guang-an, a teacher at Sanjing Road Elementary School, said: "Our school discussed the issue of Wu Xun's promotion of education for several days, but we always felt that his motives were good." Cao Ting, a member of the Northeast Cultural Troupe, said: "Previously, some of us felt that, at that time, Wu Xun's motives might have been for the sake of poor children. Before the age of twenty-one, he worked for others, and may have thought about promoting education because he was oppressed and bullied by landlords. Although he did not participate in the revolution, he always wanted to solve the problems of the poor, and there was some sense of resistance." Now, ample historical facts have resolved these ideological problems. First, did Wu Xun have the motive of "establishing free schools" from the very beginning? Yao Zhen-xian, a teacher at Shenyang Municipal Third Middle School, said: "From 'The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun,' we can see that Wu Xun had no motive for running schools for poor children at all. He was originally a big hooligan who did not work, and only decided to put up the signboard of 'promoting education' because he was young and strong and not easy to beg. Later, he made money through land exploitation and usury, but he did not really run a free school. It was only later that he was forced by the landlord Guo Fen to make it come true and establish a 'Chongxian Free School.'" Qian De-run, a teacher at Shenyang Municipal Sixth Middle School, said: "From the time he (referring to Wu Xun) put up the signboard of promoting education to the completion of the first 'free school' – 'Chongxian Free School' – thirty years passed. If it was really 'to run free schools for poor children,' why did he have to wait until thirty years later, when he had a lot of money, to do it? And in the thirty years, Wu Xun did not run free schools, but engaged in high-interest exploitation of the working people." Second, historical facts prove that Wu Xun did not run "free schools" without seeking fame and profit, but precisely for fame and profit. Tie Guang-an said: "After Wu Xun received the plaque of 'Doing Good Deeds,' he carried it around the streets for several days, which shows that he was fond of fame." Yao Zhen-xian, a teacher at Shenyang Municipal Third Middle School, said: "Wu Xun was fond of fame, and he was very worried in his later years that he would not be able to build a shrine for him." Third, there were no poor children in Wu Xun's "free schools." Qian De-run, a teacher at Sixth Middle School, said: "Wu Xun's 'free school' was full of scholars. I know that in the old society, most scholars were idlers who preyed on the people. As for the literacy class, it was only established eight years after the 'Chongxian Free School' was founded, and only two of the students were children of laborers, and the rest were merchants and relatively wealthy people."

　　Was Wu Xun's "Asceticism" Good?

    Many people were once misled by Wu Xun's so-called "asceticism." For example, Shen Yu-hong, a teacher at Shenyang Municipal Sanjing Road Elementary School, said: "We used to think that his asceticism was good, although he exploited and raised money everywhere, it was always for poor children." However, the investigation revealed Wu Xun's pretense of promoting education, and the confusion of some people was also dispelled. Shen Yu-hong said: "Wu Xun's 'begging' was a rogue, vagrant behavior, because 'it is better to beg as you please than to work hard and be bullied.' And later, he was no longer 'begging,' but a big landlord and high-interest operator." Xu Wen-ping, a teacher at Shenyang Municipal Third Middle School, said: "Wu Xun's thirty years were not all 'begging,' and when he 'begged,' he demanded it aggressively, you had to give it whether you wanted to or not. Later, he even frequented the mansions of gentry, landlords, and bureaucrats, colluding with them to exploit the working people. His begging 'asceticism' was all deceitful." Cao Ting, a member of the Northeast Cultural Troupe, said: "His (referring to Wu Xun's) asceticism was a rogue means for himself to climb up."

　　Was Wu Xun Limited by Historical Conditions?

    Qian De-run, a teacher at Sixth Middle School, said that he used to think: "Wu Xun's era limited him, he did not understand what materialism was, and being able to promote education was already relatively good." Cao Ting, a member of the Cultural Troupe, also said: "In the past, some people thought that Wu Xun did not think of revolution, but of promoting education, because the feudal literary style of the time and place influenced his consciousness." Xu Wen-ping, a teacher at Third Middle School, said: "We used to think that historical conditions limited Wu Xun. Using education to replace revolution is certainly not possible, but Wu Xun at that time could not understand this principle." However, historical facts also prove that this understanding is wrong. Qian De-run corrected his wrong understanding, saying: "'The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun' proves that in the vicinity of Wu Xun's village there was the peasant revolution led by Song Jing-shi, but he did not participate, but went to 'promote education.'" Cao Ting said: "At that time, there were two paths, revolution and reaction, placed before Wu Xun, but he chose the latter." Xu Wen-ping said: "Wu Xun did not not know about revolution, but went in the opposite direction of revolution. The working people were in revolution, and he was kneeling to the ruling class."

　　The Issue of Wu Xun's Class Background

    Regarding Wu Xun's class background, writer An Wei supplemented and corrected the analysis he made in "Wu Xun's Class Component" (published in the Northeast Daily on June 23rd), saying: "In the past, when studying this issue, the materials were very limited, and they were all written by people who praised Wu Xun. Therefore, many of the things I wrote in that article need to be corrected. For example, the issue of Wu Xun's work for others, it is now proven that he only worked for a little over a year. My article, which believed that he worked for others before the age of twenty-one and estimated his component to be a hired worker, has been proven wrong. Also, his mother was originally said to have died early, but she did not. This also has an impact on estimating his component and his character." Cao Ting, a member of the Northeast Cultural Troupe, said: "Wu Xun was very harsh on the working people and kowtowed to landlords and rulers. He did not marry, but recognized more than a hundred 'godmothers.' This is fundamentally not the quality of the working people." Xu Wen-ping, a teacher at Shenyang Municipal Third Middle School, said: "He was not a member of the working people at all. He only worked for a year and then stopped, and was willing to beg for food, and later became a big creditor and a big landlord." And he said: "The working people all look down on Wu Xun, calling him Wu Doumo (Wu Bean Gruel), and do not bother to talk about him, but when they talk about the peasant revolutionary leader Song Jing-shi, they are full of interest. It can be seen that Wu Xun and the working people are completely on opposite paths."

　　Sun Yu, Li Shi-zhao and Other Wu Xun Propagandists Distorted History to an Intolerable Extent

    Cao Ting of the Northeast Cultural Troupe said: "'The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun' allows us to understand Wu Xun more essentially, and also to understand Sun Yu, Li Shi-zhao and other Wu Xun propagandists more essentially." Qian De-run, a teacher at Shenyang Municipal Sixth Middle School, originally felt that Wu Xun was "limited by historical conditions" and there was something excusable, so Sun Yu and others could also be forgiven. But now that he has clarified the true face of Wu Xun, he also recognizes that the mistakes of Sun Yu and others are intolerable. He said: "Sun Yu is a person who has studied Wu Xun, but how did he 'study' him? He fabricated facts and used wonderful techniques to eulogize reactionary and ugly figures." Cao Ting said: "Sun Yu described Wu Xun in the film as a filial son who did not marry, which were all originally false." Writer An Wei pointed out: "Now it can be clearly seen that the self-criticism of Sun Yu and others is extremely superficial and extremely insincere."

    Everyone believes that the propagandists of Wu Xun have distorted and fabricated history to an intolerable extent. They have painted, embellished, and eulogized extremely ugly reactionary figures in history as revolutionary figures, and used him to promote bourgeois reactionary ideas, which has a serious poisonous effect on the people.

### 《武训历史调查记》解决了思想问题——记一个座谈会上的发言

　　《武训历史调查记》解决了思想问题 
    ——记一个座谈会上的发言
    编者按：《武训历史调查记》发表后，引起了全国各地广大读者的注意。东北日报最近邀请了沈阳市教育界、文化界的人士，座谈他们读了这一调查记后的感想和收获。本文便是这次座谈会上的记录。
            武训兴学的动机根本不是好的
    与会者一致反映，在《武训历史调查记》发表以前，许多人未能真正在思想上解决的问题是关于武训兴学动机的问题。沈阳市立三经路完小教师沈玉红反映：有的人虽也承认他的“义学”实际上是为地主阶级服务，但却认为武训兴学的动机是好的。有人说他动机也是坏的，但却缺乏足够的根据。而且有人认为武训兴学动机好，而就原谅了他的土地剥削与高利贷剥削，认为“不管怎样剥削劳动人民，但他的目的是为了穷孩子。”在说到《武训历史调查记》发表以前，对这一问题的看法时，三经路完小教师铁广安说：“我们学校关于武训兴学的问题讨论了好几天，但总感到他的动机是好的。”东北文工团曹汀同志说：“以前，我们有些人觉得，在当时，武训的动机可能是有为了穷孩子的。他在二十一岁以前，为人抗活，可能因为受了地主的压迫和欺侮，所以想到要兴学。虽然没有去革命，但他总是想解决穷人的问题，还有一些反抗的意识，”现在，充分的历史事实，解决了这些思想问题。首先，武训是否一开始就有“兴义学”的动机呢？沈阳市立第三中学教师姚振先说：“从《武训历史调查记》上看得到，武训根本没有为穷孩子办学的动机。他一开始就是不事劳动的大流氓，只是因为年轻力壮不易乞讨，才决定打起‘兴学’的招牌。以后，靠土地剥削和放高利贷有了钱了，但他也并未真的去办义学。只是后来被地主郭芬所逼，才弄假成真办了一所‘崇贤义塾’。”沈阳市立第六中学教师钱德润说：“从他（指武训）打起兴学的招牌到第一所‘义学’——‘崇贤义塾’办成，中间过了三十年，如果真是‘为穷孩子办义学’，为什么一定要到三十年后，有了许多许多钱时才来办？而三十年中，武训不办义学，却在那儿高利盘剥劳动人民。”第二，史实证明武训办“义学”并不是不为名利，而恰恰是为名为利。铁广安说：“武训得到了‘乐善好施’的匾额后，抬着游街几天，可见他是好名的。”沈阳市立第三中学教师姚振先说：“武训是好名的，他晚年很担心不能给他修祠堂。”第三，武训的“义学”里并没有穷孩子。第六中学教师钱德润说：“武训的‘义学’里尽是些秀才。我知道旧社会里的秀才多是些游手好闲鱼肉人民的人。至于蒙班，是在‘崇贤义塾’办了八年之后才办的，而学生中也只有两名是劳动者的子弟，其余都是商人和比较有钱的人。”
            武训的“苦行”是好的吗？
    许多人曾为武训的所谓“苦行”所迷惑。如沈阳市立三经路完小教师沈玉红说：“我们过去总觉得他的苦行是好的，虽然他剥削，到处搞钱，但总是为了穷孩子。”但是，调查记揭穿了武训兴学的幌子，某些人的迷惑也解除了。沈玉红说：“武训的‘行乞’是种流氓、游民的行径，是因为‘抗活受人欺，不如讨饭随自己’。而后来，他已不是‘行乞’，却是大地主和高利贷经营者。”沈阳市立第三中学教师徐文平说：“武训三十年并不都是‘行乞’，而他‘行乞’时是恶要，给也得给，不给也得给。后来更出入豪绅、地主、官僚的门庭，和他们勾搭一起剥削劳苦人民，他的行乞‘苦行’，都是骗人的。”东北文工团曹汀同志说：“他（指武训）的苦行是为了自己向上爬的流氓手段。”
            武训是否受历史条件的限制？
    六中教师钱德润说他过去认为：“武训生活的时代限制了他，他不懂得什么叫唯物主义，能够兴学，已是较好的了。”文工团曹汀同志也说：“过去有人以为，武训没有想到革命，而想到兴学，是因为当时当地的封建文风影响了他的意识。”三中徐文平说：“以前我们觉得，历史条件限制了武训。用教育来代替革命当然不行，但当时的武训不能懂得这个道理。”但历史事实也证明了这种认识是错误的。钱德润纠正自己的错误认识说：“《武训历史调查记》证明，就在武训的村庄的附近就有宋景诗所领导的农民革命，他没有去参加，而去‘兴学’。”曹汀同志说：“当时是革命与反动两条路放在武训面前，但他选择了后者。”徐文平说：“武训不是不知道革命，而是与革命背道而驰，劳动人民在革命，他在向统治阶级下跪。”
            武训的成份问题
    关于武训的成份，作家安危补充和更正他在“武训的阶级成份”（载六月二十三日东北日报）一文中所作的分析说：“过去研究这一问题时，材料有限得很，而且都是歌颂武训的人所写的。因此我所写的那篇文章有许多需要更正。如武训抗活的问题，现在证明，他抗活的时间只有一年多，我那篇文章，认为他在二十一岁以前是给人抗活，其成份是雇工的估计已证明不对。又如他的母亲原来都说早就死了，其实也不是。这对估计他的成份和他的为人也是有影响的。”东北文工团曹汀同志说：“武训对劳动人民非常刻薄，对地主、统治者都磕头。他不结婚，却认一百多个‘干娘’。这根本不是劳动人民的品质。”沈阳市三中教师徐文平说：“他根本不是劳动人民，他只干了一年活就不干了，而乐意去讨饭，后来更成为大债主和大地主。”并说：“劳动人民都瞧不起武训，叫他武豆沫，不屑去谈他，但谈到农民革命领袖宋景诗时，则津津有味。可见武训与劳动人民是完全背道而驰的。”
            孙瑜、李士钊等武训宣传者歪曲历史到了不可容忍的程度
    东北文工团曹汀说：“《武训历史调查记》使我们更本质地认识了武训，也更本质地认识了孙瑜、李士钊等武训宣传者。”沈阳市第六中学教师钱德润原来觉得武训“受历史条件限制”，有可原谅之处，因此孙瑜等人也可原谅。但现在弄清了武训的真面目之后，也就认识了孙瑜等人的错误是不可容忍的。他说：“孙瑜是对武训有研究的人，但他是怎样‘研究’的呢？他捏造事实，以美妙的手法歌颂反动的丑恶人物。”曹汀说：“孙瑜在电影里描写武训是孝子，不结婚，原来都是假的。”作家安危指出：“现在可以清楚地看出，孙瑜等人的检讨是极不深刻的，极不诚恳的。”
    大家都认为武训的宣传者们歪曲与捏造历史到了不可容忍的程度，他们将历史上极端丑恶的反动的人物，涂改、粉饰和歌颂成为革命的人物，并假借他来宣传资产阶级反动思想，这对人民的毒害是严重的。
