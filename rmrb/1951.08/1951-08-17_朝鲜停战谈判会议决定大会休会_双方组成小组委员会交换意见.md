Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: This reporter learned from the Korean front headquarters that the 26th meeting of the Korean armistice talks began at 12:00 noon (Korean time) on August 16th and ended at 1:20 pm. At the 26th meeting, based on the suggestion of the United Nations Command delegation, both sides agreed to organize a joint subcommittee to exchange views on the second item of the agenda and to submit recommendations to both delegations to resolve the current deadlock. The joint subcommittee will consist of two representatives and two assistants designated by each side. During the subcommittee's meetings, the General Assembly will be adjourned until the subcommittee submits recommendations and issues requiring discussion and decision by the General Assembly.

General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, pointed out at the 26th meeting that although the other side has repeatedly claimed that their proposal can be adjusted at any time, they have in fact consistently insisted on the principle of advancing the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone north of the 38th parallel and into our side's positions, the so-called adjustment of the military demarcation line is to adjust it within our positions. Although our side's proposal uses the latitude line of the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, our side's demilitarized zone proposal based on this is completely subject to necessary and reasonable adjustments based on the terrain and the respective needs of both sides.

General Nam Il clearly pointed out: Regarding the issue of the military demarcation line, only on the premise that the other side fundamentally abandons its unfair and unreasonable proposal and seriously considers the fair and reasonable proposal put forward by our side, which uses the 38th parallel as the baseline of the demilitarized zone, is there any possibility of reaching an agreement by changing to a subcommittee-style discussion.

The first meeting of the subcommittee is scheduled to be held at 10:00 am on August 17th.

　　朝鲜停战谈判会议决定大会休会
    双方组成小组委员会交换意见
    南日将军指出：美方只有根本放弃其不合理的方案，认真考虑我方方案，获致协议才有可能。
    【新华社平壤十六日电】本社记者自朝鲜前线总部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议第二十六次会议在八月十六日中午十二时（朝鲜时间）开始，下午一时二十分结束。第二十六次会议上，根据联合国军代表团方面的建议，双方同意组织一联合小组委员会，交换双方对议程第二项的意见，并向双方代表团提出解决目前僵局的建议。联合小组委员会由双方各指定代表二人及助理人员二人组成之。小组委员会开会期间，大会休会，直至小组委员会提出建议和问题要求大会讨论与决定时为止。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军，在二十六次会议上指出：对方虽然一再声称，对方方案是随时可以调整的，但实际上却始终坚持将军事分界线与非军事区推进至三八线以北我方阵地之内的原则，所谓调整军事分界线是在我方阵地之内调整。而我方方案虽然是以三八线的一条纬度线作为军事分界线，但以此为基础的我方非军事区方案，却是完全可以根据地形以及双方各自的需要加以必要与合理的调整的。
    南日将军明白指出：军事分界线问题，只有在对方根本放弃其不公平不合理的方案，认真考虑我方提出的以三八线为非军事区基线的公平合理的方案的前提之下，改用小组委员会方式的讨论才有获致协议的可能。
    小组委员会第一次会议定于八月十七日上午十时举行。
