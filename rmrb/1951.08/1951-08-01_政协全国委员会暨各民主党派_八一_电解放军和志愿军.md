(I) Telegram to the Chinese People's Liberation Army to Chairman Mao of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all commanders and fighters:

　　Today is the glorious anniversary of the 24th founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The people of the whole country are jubilantly celebrating this great festival. We, the democratic parties, would like to extend our highest respect and warmest congratulations to you.

　　The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the armed force of the Chinese people, created by the Communist Party of China and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The 24-year history of arduous struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is also the history of the Chinese people's revolution moving towards victory. With this people's army, the Chinese people have achieved glorious liberation. The people of the whole country are infinitely proud to have this just and powerful army!

　　For twenty-four years, you have fought heroically with unparalleled self-sacrificing spirit, overcoming all difficulties, repelling the invasion of Japanese imperialists, and defeating the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by US imperialism, completely destroying the feudal forces that had weighed on the people's heads for thousands of years, and establishing the New Democratic People's Republic of China. Now, except for Taiwan, the whole country has been liberated, and New Democratic construction is underway. The future of our great motherland is full of splendid prospects. All this has been exchanged for by your bloody battles. Your great achievements are engraved in the hearts of the people of the whole country and will also be engraved forever in the great history of China.

　　On June 27th of last year, US imperialism frantically launched a war of aggression in Korea and occupied our Taiwan by force. In the past year, they have suffered serious blows from the people of China and Korea. After their aggressive plan to destroy the entire North Korea was crushed, they accepted the Korean armistice negotiations, but the success or failure of the negotiations is still difficult to predict, so we must be a hundred times more vigilant. We must strive to launch a broad youth enlistment movement, and promote a nationwide movement to increase production and donate weapons, so as to strengthen the strength of our People's Liberation Army and consolidate our national defense.

　　On this glorious festival, we want to assure you: we support you wholeheartedly, and the people of the whole country support you wholeheartedly. We firmly believe that with the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese people will forever move from victory to victory, and the Chinese territory will forever be sacred and inviolable.

　　Today, the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is even stronger because of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the cause of defending peace throughout the world will surely achieve final victory.

　　Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

　　Long live the Chinese People's Army!

　　Long live the Chinese People's Air Force!

　　Long live the Chinese People's Navy!

　　Long live the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolutionary War!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu De!

　　Long live the Communist Party of China!

(II) Telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Commander Peng and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

　　Today, when the Chinese people are warmly celebrating the August 1st Army Day, all our democratic parties in the country would like to express our highest respect to you with unparalleled excitement and gratitude.

　　You bravely cooperated with the Korean People's Army to drive the enemy from the Yalu River back to the 38th parallel, causing heavy losses to the enemy. You have not only ensured the security of the motherland, but also made a great contribution to defending peace in Asia and world peace. All the Chinese people are proud of you, and all peace-loving people in the world are also encouraged by you!

　　For nine months, you have overcome all difficulties and defeated the arrogant aggressors. Your resolute and courageous fighting spirit fully demonstrates the great and excellent traditions of the Chinese working people.

　　Now, after suffering heavy blows from the Chinese and Korean people, the enemy has entered into armistice negotiations with the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. During the negotiation period, we firmly believe that our heroic Volunteer Army will surely be able to heighten their vigilance and closely monitor the enemy's actions to prevent the enemy's sneak attacks. The people of our rear must promote the patriotic movement universally and deeply, and step up the movement to increase production and donate weapons to support you, in order to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and complete our sacred task of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country!

　　Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

　　Long live peace in Asia and the world!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　政协全国委员会暨各民主党派“八一”电解放军和志愿军
    （一）致中国人民解放军电中国人民革命军事委员会毛主席中国人民解放军朱总司令暨全体指挥员战斗员同志们：
    今天是中国人民解放军建军二十四周年的光辉纪念日。全国人民都欢欣鼓舞地庆祝这个伟大的节日。我们各民主党派谨向你们致以最崇高的敬意和最热烈的祝贺。
    中国人民解放军是中国人民的武力，是中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席与中国人民解放军朱总司令所创造的。中国人民解放军廿四年艰苦战斗的历史，也就是中国人民革命走向胜利的历史。有了这支人民的军队，中国人民才有了光荣的解放。全国人民以有这支正义的强大的军队为无上的光荣！
    二十四年来，你们以无比的自我牺牲精神，英勇战斗，克服了一切困难，击退了日本帝国主义者的侵略，打垮了美帝国主义支持的蒋介石匪帮的反动统治，把几千年来压在人民头上的封建势力彻底摧毁，建立了新民主主义的中华人民共和国。现在除台湾外全国已经解放，新民主主义建设正在开展，我们伟大的祖国前途充满了灿烂的美景。这一切都是你们流血战斗换来的。你们的丰功伟绩铭刻在全国人民的心坎中，也将永远铭刻在伟大的中国历史上。
    美帝国主义者于去年六月二十七日疯狂地在朝鲜发动了侵略战争并用武力侵占了我们的台湾。这一年来，他们遭受了中朝两国人民的严重打击。他们在灭亡全朝鲜的侵略计划被粉碎以后，才接受了朝鲜的停战谈判，但谈判的成败现在还难预断，因此我们还要百倍地提高警惕。我们一定要努力展开广大青年的参军运动，推进全国人民的增加生产捐献武器运动，以加强我们人民解放军的力量，以巩固我们祖国的国防。
    在这个光辉的节日，我们要向你们保证：我们全心全意支持着你们，全国人民都全心全意支持着你们。我们坚决相信：有了人民解放军，中国人民就永远由胜利走向胜利，中国领土就永远是神圣不可侵犯的。
    今天以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的力量也因有了中国人民解放军而更加壮大了，全世界保卫和平的事业一定能够得到最后的胜利。
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民陆军万岁！
    中国人民空军万岁！
    中国人民海军万岁！
    中国人民革命战争伟大胜利万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！

    （二）致中国人民志愿军电中国人民志愿军彭司令员暨全体指挥员战斗员同志们：
    在中国人民热烈庆祝八一建军节的今天，我们全国各民主党派谨以无比的兴奋感激的心情，向你们致最崇高的敬礼。
    你们英勇地配合朝鲜人民军，把敌人从鸭绿江边赶回到三八线上，使敌人遭受到惨重的损失。你们不但使祖国安全有了保障，而且对保卫亚洲和平与世界和平也有了伟大的贡献。全中国人民因你们而骄傲，全世界爱好和平的人民也因你们而振奋！
    九个月来你们克服了一切困难，战胜了狂妄的侵略者。你们坚毅而勇敢的作战精神，充分发扬了中国劳动人民的伟大优秀的传统。
    现在，敌人在遭受到中朝人民沉重打击之后，已和朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军进行停战谈判。在谈判时期，我们坚决信赖我们英勇的志愿军必定能够提高警惕，严密监视敌人的行动，以防敌人的乘机袭击。我们后方的全国人民一定要普及而深入地推进爱国运动，加紧增加生产、捐献武器的运动来支援你们，以争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，完成我们抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    全亚洲全世界的和平万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
