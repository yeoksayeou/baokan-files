Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 7th: Commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are actively helping the Korean people with production during breaks in fighting, and often risk their lives to bravely extinguish fires caused by enemy aircraft strafing.

When the hooves of the American invading army approached the Pyonggang, Kimhwa, and Chorwon areas, the local Korean people fled to the rear. Their fields were deserted. The soldiers of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army put forward a slogan: "The enemy turns good fields into wasteland, we will turn wasteland into good fields!" They used breaks in fighting to irrigate the rice paddies and weed the dry fields, reviving the withered crops. Soldiers of another Volunteer Army unit spent two and a half nights transplanting all the rice seedlings in the local rice paddies. Staff and soldiers of the logistics department of a certain unit harvested 38 mu of wheat for the farmers in the area in one day. They couldn't find sickles, so they pulled the wheat by hand. After harvesting, they delivered the wheat to each family. They neatly stacked the wheat whose owners they couldn't find in the fields, and covered it with grass to prevent rain and mold.

Volunteer Army commanders and fighters often bravely rushed into villages to help villagers put out fires during enemy bombing and strafing. During the Fifth Campaign, when enemy aircraft wreaked havoc in Yongsu-dong on the west bank of the Zhao Yang River, the soldiers of a certain Volunteer Army unit stationed near the village rushed to the top of the mountain, set up machine guns, and fired at the enemy aircraft. After driving away the enemy aircraft, they rushed back to the village and put out the fire caused by the enemy strafing. In Wonheung-ri, a family of four was burned by gasoline bombs dropped by enemy aircraft. A certain field hospital of the Volunteer Army immediately sent a dressing change team to treat them. At that time, there was a shortage of medicines for treating burns, so the medical staff took the lard prepared by their own cooking room for stir-frying dishes to prepare medicine. The Volunteer Army also cares for the Korean orphans in the area with utmost care. The troops stationed in Haba-ri and Yongsu-dong helped the orphans dig air-raid shelters and gave them food and clothing.

### 我志愿军指战员帮助朝鲜人民生产

　　我志愿军指战员帮助朝鲜人民生产
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】中国人民志愿军的指挥员和战斗员们利用战斗空隙，积极帮助朝鲜人民生产，并常常冒着生命危险，奋勇救熄敌机扫射所引起的火灾。
    在美国侵略军的兽蹄迫近平康、金化、铁原地区时，当地的朝鲜人民纷纷向后方逃避。他们的田园荒芜了。志愿军某部战士们就提出了一个口号：“敌人把良田变成荒田，咱们要把荒田变成良田！”他们利用战斗空隙，给稻田灌上水，给旱田锄了草，使枯竭了的庄稼复活。另一部志愿军战士们曾用两个半晚上，将当地的稻田全部插上秧苗。某部后勤部门的工作人员和战士，曾在一天内替驻地农民抢收了三十八亩麦子。他们找不到镰刀，就用手拔，收割完了，又把麦子分别送到各家去。他们把调查不到主人的麦子，叠得整整齐齐地搁在田里，并且盖上草，以防淋雨霉烂。
    志愿军指挥员和战斗员们经常在敌机投弹扫射的时候，奋不顾身地跑进村中，帮助村人灭火。在第五次战役期间，当敌机在照阳江西岸的龙水洞施虐时，驻在该村附近的志愿军某部战士们冲上山顶，架起机枪向敌机开火，将敌机赶走后，又赶回村里，将敌机扫射所引起的大火救熄。在元兴里，有一家四口人都被敌机丢下的汽油弹烧伤了。志愿军某野战医院立即派了一个换药组前去治疗。当时缺少医治烧伤的药品，医务人员便把自己炊事房准备炒菜用的猪油拿来配药。志愿军对驻地的朝鲜孤儿，也是关怀无微不至。驻在下八夜里和龙水洞的部队，曾帮助孤儿们挖防空洞，并给他们食物和衣服。
