　　Hickmet's Anger
　　The Turkish reactionary government, under pressure from world public opinion and the Turkish people, was forced a few days ago to release the democratic fighter and famous poet Hickmet, who had been imprisoned for twelve years. Recently, it even announced the deprivation of his Turkish citizenship. Hickmet, who is visiting the Soviet Union, sent a letter to Pravda expressing great anger about this matter. He pointed out that these lackeys of American capitalists have no right to deprive him of his citizenship. He said, "Before depriving me of my Turkish citizenship, these rulers had already deprived all the Turkish people of their citizenship. They have turned the people into subjects of the United States."
　　This crime by the Turkish reactionary government will only increase the Turkish people's love for this great poet and their hatred for this small group of national traitors.

　　Nazi Hounds Have Found a New Master
　　The Spanish fascist dictator Franco has, in accordance with the orders of the United States, staged a farce of "reorganizing" the government. In the "reorganized" Franco government, the most important ministers of foreign affairs, internal affairs, labor, and air force remained unchanged, while the other newly appointed ministers were all old-fashioned fascists and the most loyal lackeys of the United States. Among them, the newly appointed Minister of the Army is actually Grandes, the former secretary of the Falange and the commander of the Spanish "Blue Division" who invaded the Soviet Union with Hitler's bandits during World War II. It is not surprising that American imperialism has inherited Hitler's mantle, and that these hounds who once served Hitler regard the United States as their new master.

    希克梅特的愤怒
    土耳其反动政府由于受到世界舆论和土耳其人民的压力，于数日前被迫释放了被囚禁达十二年之久的民主斗士和名诗人希克梅特，最近竟又宣布剥夺了他的土耳其公民权。正在苏联访问的希克梅特为此事特致函真理报，表示极大愤怒。他指出，这些美国资本家的走狗没有权力剥夺他的公民权。他说：“在剥夺我的土耳其公民权之前，这些统治者早就剥夺了所有土耳其人民的公民权了。他们已把人民变为美国的臣民。”
    土耳其反动政府这一罪行，只会更增加土耳其人民对这一伟大诗人的热爱，以及对他们这一小撮民族叛徒的仇恨。
            纳粹的猎犬找到了新主人
    西班牙的法西斯独裁者佛朗哥已遵照美国的命令，演出了一出“改组”政府的滑稽剧。在“改组”后的佛朗哥政府中，最主要的外交、内政、劳工和空军四部部长原封不动，而其余新上任的部长，也都是老牌的法西斯分子和美国最忠实的走狗，其中的新任陆军部长，竟是前长枪党书记、第二次世界大战时和希特勒匪徒一起入侵苏联的西班牙“蓝色师团”司令格朗德斯。美帝国主义承袭了希特勒的衣钵，这些曾经为希特勒效劳的猎犬们，把美国当成它的新主人，这是不足为奇的。
