In Jilin Province, mining areas are mostly located in remote areas with inconvenient transportation. To solve the difficulties in transporting timber, the timber needed by the mining areas is mostly requested by the public mining enterprises themselves with government approval. However, in this situation, some cadres of the mining bureaus do not proceed from the interests of the country, but have serious departmentalism and wantonly cut down forests. For example, in a certain mine in Antu County, the approved felling of kiln roof wood was 1,200 cubic meters in 1951. However, when felling, they did not carry out thinning operations in accordance with government regulations, but instead picked the good ones to "pull out the big fur" (i.e., pick the good and big ones to cut down). In terms of timber utilization, there is also a serious waste phenomenon. When making materials, the head and tail are cut off, and 30 percent of the usable treetop wood is abandoned in the forest. In addition, they also changed the felling forest farm without authorization. Originally designated to be felled on the front slope of Shasongbei, the mine moved to the vicinity of the antimony mine entrance for the convenience of transporting materials, saving labor and money, without approval. In this way, the trees near the mine entrance that could no longer be felled were destroyed again. Another example is a certain gold mine bureau under the Nonferrous Metals Administration Bureau of the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department. In order to build a gunpowder depot, it cut down 7,000 square meters of forest land in Banmiaozi without approval in November 1950. Most of the felled trees were hardwood, with elm trees accounting for 70 percent, and the remaining 30 percent were precious tree species such as yellow rosewood and ash; a very small number were softwood such as poplar and birch. In September of the same year, the mine bureau cut down 1,000 trees without authorization, and the tree species were also hardwood such as ash, oak, and elm. After the local government learned of this situation, it contacted the mine bureau. However, Liu, the section chief of the mine bureau's management section, shirked responsibility, saying that he did not know. Later, due to conclusive evidence and witnesses, he had to admit it, but he said without principle: "Let it go, it's all public affairs!" This serious departmental point of view is incompatible with the interests of the country.

　　吉林某些矿局干部存在着严重的本位主义思想
    违反规定滥伐山林浪费木材
    吉林省矿区多位于交通不便的偏远地区。为解决运材上的困难，矿区的需用木材，多报请政府批准，由公营矿山企业自行采伐。但是，在这种情况下，有些矿局干部却不从国家利益出发，存在着严重的本位主义思想，滥行砍伐森林。如安图县某矿，一九五一年批准采伐窑顶木一千二百立方公尺，在采伐时，却不按政府的规定施行间伐作业，竟挑好的“拔大毛”（即挑好的、大的砍伐）。在木材利用方面，更存在着严重的浪费现象。造材是砍头去尾，百分之三十能用的梢头木都抛弃在树林里。另外，他们还擅自变更采伐林场。原指定在沙松背前坡采伐，而矿山方面为便于运材，省工省钱，未经批准即移至锑矿坑口附近采伐。这样，使坑口附近已不能再行采伐的林木，又遭到破坏。又如东北人民政府工业部有色金属管理局某金矿局，为修建火药库，不经批准，一九五○年十一月，在板庙子擅自把七千平方公尺的林地砍光，所伐树木绝大部分都是硬杂木，榆树占百分之七十，其余百分之三十均为黄婆罗、水曲柳等珍贵树种；极少部分为杨桦等软杂木。同年九月该矿局擅自砍伐林木一千根，树种亦为水曲柳、柞、榆等硬杂木。该地区政府知道这情况后，即去矿局联系。而该矿局经理科刘科长，竟推诿说不知道，后因人证物证确凿，不得不承认，但又无原则地说：“拉倒吧，都是公家事！”这种严重的本位观点是与国家利益不能相容的。
