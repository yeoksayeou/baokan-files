Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, August 23rd: Our front-line reporter reports: After the frequent attacks launched by the US invading forces and the ROK puppet army since the armistice negotiations were resolutely countered by the Chinese and Korean People's Army, they launched a large-scale and fierce offensive on the eastern front from the 18th, concentrating even greater forces than before. The focus of their offensive was on the high ground north of Yangkou and Linjie, with approximately two battalions to two regiments of troops deployed for each target. In the western front areas of northwestern Lianchuan and west of Tieyuan, the US-ROK forces also launched coordinated offensives on the 18th. The Chinese and Korean People's Army, who were on high alert, have maintained a high degree of vigilance since the armistice negotiations, holding their positions. After the US side completely exposed its deceptive and cunning nature in the negotiations, they became even more vigilant against possible surprise attacks by the enemy. As a result, the enemy suffered strong resistance and lost a large number of troops at the beginning of this offensive. In the battle for the 884 high ground north of Linjie, our army resolutely repelled the continuous attacks of an enemy regiment and killed or wounded approximately one battalion of their soldiers. In the battle for the 773.1 high ground line in Dumi-ri, north of Yangkou, our army bravely repelled the three-pronged attack of four enemy battalions and killed or wounded a total of about two companies of enemy soldiers. In the battle in the area west of Tieyuan, our army, with the coordination of intense artillery fire, repelled the frantic attack of more than 800 enemies and killed or wounded more than 200 of them. Among them, a squad guarding the forward position first repelled three fierce attacks by this enemy force, which outnumbered them by dozens of times.

　　美李军在朝鲜东部前线发动冒险进攻
    中朝部队坚强阻击大量歼敌
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十三日电】本社前线记者报道：美国侵略军和李伪军自停战谈判以来所发动的频繁攻击，连续遭到中朝人民军队的坚决打击之后，于十八日起又集中较前更大的兵力在东部前线发动了大规模的猛烈进攻。其进攻的重点是在杨口和麟蹄以北一线高地，对每个攻击目标所投入的兵力约在两个营到两个团之间。在西线的涟川西北和铁原以西等地区，美李军也在十八日一度发动配合性的进攻。严阵以待的中朝人民军队从停战谈判以来，始终保持高度的警惕性，扼守着阵地。当美方在谈判中完全暴露其欺骗狡诈的真面目以后，就更加警惕着敌人可能的突然进攻。因而，敌人在这次攻势中一开始就遭到坚强的阻击和损失大量的兵力。我军某部在麟蹄以北八八四高地的战斗中，坚决击退敌一个团兵力的连续进攻，并杀伤其约一个营的兵员。某部在杨口以北杜密里七七三点一高地一线阵地的战斗中，英勇击退敌四个营的三路进攻，并杀伤敌共约两个连的兵员。某部在铁原以西地区的战斗中，在猛烈炮火的配合下击退了八百余敌人的疯狂进攻，并杀伤其二百余名。其中据守前沿阵地的一个班曾首先击退这股数十倍于己的敌人的三次猛扑。
