On Material Supply in Cotton Purchasing
    Zhao Jinyu, Kang Weizhong

In cotton purchasing work, doing a good job in material supply is an important link. Because farmers need to purchase necessary living and production materials after selling cotton. If this need can be appropriately satisfied, farmers are willing to sell cotton. Therefore, it is very important to combine political mobilization with material supply. In the cotton purchasing and storage work in Anyang County, Pingyuan Province, the economic departments accepted farmers' requests and jointly organized several cotton purchasing and storage groups, carrying sufficient grain coupons, coal coupons, cash, etc., to go deep into the countryside, combining material supply with political mobilization. The cotton purchasing and storage work proceeded relatively smoothly. According to the statistics of eleven purchasing groups in four days, 120,000 jin of ginned cotton were purchased. Conversely, if material supply is not timely, cotton farmers will have doubts, which will affect the completion of the cotton purchasing and storage task. The Shangmaoyijian Cotton Collection Station in Anyang County lacked sufficient preparation in advance. Cotton farmers had no grain coupons when they wanted them after selling cotton, and no money when they needed money. Cotton farmers were very suspicious, which affected the development of cotton purchasing work.

Current Problems in Material Supply Work

What are the current problems in material supply work?

First, some county and district party and government cadres in some areas believe that material supply is only a matter for economic departments, and thus abandon or relax their leadership over this work. For example, leading cadres in some counties in Xinxiang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, emphasized that they were too busy to take care of it, believing that the material supply work could be done by the economic departments. Therefore, they did not actively lead or inspect. As a result, various materials were placed at the cotton purchasing stations, waiting for cotton farmers to buy them. Because farmers were too busy with farm work, they did not have time to buy, and the cotton purchasing cadres believed that cotton farmers did not need materials. Therefore, they did not try to transport goods to the countryside, resulting in poor purchasing results. In Wuqiao County, Dezhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, the price of wheat rose to 1,200 yuan per jin in mid-June because the wheat supply could not keep up. In Lianzhen, the price of wheat also rose to 1,150 yuan in early July. In addition, cotton farmers urgently needed flashlights, bicycles, bamboo shell thermos bottles, and various floral fabrics, but because the supply could not keep up, there was a phenomenon of panic buying. In addition, some places mechanically separated the mobilization work of cotton purchasing and storage from the material supply work. District and village cadres were only responsible for publicity and mobilization, and did not ask about what materials cotton farmers needed; economic departments only managed the supply of materials and did not actively combine with political mobilization work. All these hindered the completion of the cotton purchasing and storage task.

Second, economic department cadres in some areas lacked investigation and understanding of the material needs of cotton farmers after selling cotton, resulting in a situation where the materials needed by cotton farmers were not supplied, and unnecessary materials were supplied a lot, resulting in a supply-demand imbalance. For example, cotton farmers in the Subei cotton area urgently needed timber and yuanmai (a type of wheat) after selling cotton, and Qidong area needed zhongbai rice, but the relevant state-owned specialized companies in the area did not try their best to transfer these materials, resulting in rising prices of timber and yuanmai. Farmers in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, needed fertilizer, alkali noodles, and department stores; Handan Prefecture needed rubber wheels, bicycles, glass, socks, and sneakers; cotton-producing areas in Henan needed a large number of daily necessities. All these formed a market panic buying phenomenon due to the lack of these materials, which hindered the cotton purchasing work. Cotton farmers in Cheng'an County, Hebei Province, did not need red sorghum, but the county grain company transported a lot of red sorghum, which was of little use for cotton purchasing.

In addition, insufficient coordination and contact between various economic departments also had a negative impact on the cotton purchasing and storage work. For example, the cooperative in Pingyuan Province and the provincial flower and cloth company argued over the handling fees for printing wheat and grain promissory notes, and the grain coupons remained in the cooperative for ten days. The provincial grain company and the flower and cloth company failed to reach an agreement on the pricing of grain, and several agreements failed. All these affected the completion of the cotton purchasing task. Due to the lack of unified steps and mutual cooperation among the economic departments in the Subei region, private merchants took the opportunity to raise prices and hoard goods. In one and a half months, the company only completed less than 20 percent of the total purchasing and storage task. The Laozhong Cotton Collection Station in Huaiyang, Henan, did not closely cooperate with various economic units to go to the countryside to exchange cotton for materials, but only "sat in the house and waited for customers." According to statistics in mid-July, only 18.4 percent of the total task was completed. This shows that if various economic departments do not closely combine and take measures to facilitate farmers, the cotton purchasing and storage task cannot be completed.

Matters Needing Attention in Doing a Good Job in Supply

How can we do a good job in material supply?

First of all, the leading organs of party and government and economic departments in cotton-producing areas must attach importance to this work ideologically. We must recognize that political mobilization and material supply are indispensable. With only political mobilization and no material supply, the needs of cotton farmers for living and production materials cannot be properly met. On the one hand, it will make cotton farmers distrust us, and on the other hand, it will cause price fluctuations. Cotton farmers in Ningjin area, Shandong, said when they saw our cadres: "When you mobilized us to sell cotton, you said that there would be bean cake if we wanted bean cake, and grain if we wanted grain after selling cotton; now we can't get anything." This shows that the lack of necessary material supply will seriously affect the cotton purchasing and storage work. In order to overcome this phenomenon, the leading organs in cotton-producing areas should organize inspection teams from top to bottom to inspect the material preparation and supply situation in various places in a timely and itinerant manner, so that the quality and quantity of materials can generally meet the needs of cotton farmers, and everything should be convenient for cotton farmers. The Northwest China Flower and Cloth Company has now formed two inspection teams to inspect work in Xianyang, Jingyang, Sanyuan, Weinan, Lintong, and Dali cotton-producing areas to solve the problems of material preparation and mutual cooperation among economic departments in these areas. The Anyang Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office of Pingyuan Province specially organized several cadres to conduct itinerant inspections, and discovered and solved some specific problems in material supply, which played a great role. This method has proved to be more effective.

Secondly, all relevant economic departments must be consistent and closely cooperate to facilitate farmers everywhere. Past experience has proved that the cotton purchasing and storage task will proceed faster in places where material supply is sufficient and convenient for farmers to purchase. The department store company in Huaiyang, Henan, and the local flower and cloth company jointly formed a cotton purchasing and sales team, carrying a large number of fabrics and department stores, and going deep into the countryside to purchase cotton, which was welcomed by many cotton farmers. The cotton purchasing and sales team purchased more than 50,000 jin in twenty days. The daily sales of the department store company in Haifu Town, Subei, reached more than 20 million yuan. Farmers in Xiwafang and Qingfengdian villages in Ding County, Hebei, needed fertilizer. The supply and marketing cooperative purchased 80,000 jin of bean cake and exchanged bean cake for cotton, exchanging more than 1,300 jin of cotton in one day. The twenty-four cotton collection stations in Nangong County, Hebei, prepared a large number of fabrics, grain, department stores, and local products. In order to facilitate farmers, various companies promoted chain business and entrusted village cooperatives to sell on their behalf. In this way, the county purchased 900,000 jin of cotton in forty days.

Concerning the Supply of Wheat

In this cotton purchasing and storage work, the large-scale purchase of wheat by cotton farmers after selling cotton is a relatively common phenomenon in most cotton-producing areas. One of the reasons for the large-scale purchase of wheat is that the living standards of cotton farmers have improved and they need fine grains. But the main reason is that some cotton farmers want to hoard wheat for profit. The Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce said in the "Report on Cotton Purchasing and Storage Work": "Various places require a large supply of wheat. The Handan Prefecture alone needs 20 million jin. The main reason is that cotton farmers use wheat as a means of saving after selling cotton. On the other hand, the price ratio between cotton and wheat is unreasonable. In the southern cotton area, one jin of cotton is exchanged for 8 jin and 14 taels of wheat, exceeding the regulation of exchanging for 8 and a half jin of wheat, which stimulates cotton farmers to hoard wheat." Some cotton farmers in Dezhou Prefecture, Shandong, reflected: "No mobilization is needed. As long as the cooperative has wheat, we will have cotton." Some cotton farmers in Qiliying, Xinxiang, Pingyuan, said: "No matter what you say, I have an old idea: I won't release the hawk until I see the rabbit (meaning I won't sell cotton until I get wheat)." The state wheat collection agency in Shijiazhuang withdrew from the market twice because of the huge amount of wheat purchased by cotton farmers. Similar situations also occurred in other areas.

The reason why cotton farmers hoard wheat is mainly because the seasonal price difference between wheat and cotton in the past was too large. Selling cotton to buy wheat after the wheat harvest, and selling wheat to buy cotton after the new cotton is on the market, can make a lot of profit in and out. Especially last year, because the state-owned trading company did not accurately grasp the price of wheat, an unreasonable price ratio of "one jin of cotton for one dou of wheat" appeared in some areas (Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Pingyuan). Cotton farmers thus have the illusion that this will definitely happen again this year. In addition, some farmers have the wrong mentality of valuing material over currency, and are unwilling to store currency after selling cotton, worrying that the currency will depreciate.

Because farmers hoard a lot of wheat after selling cotton, they freeze a lot of funds, which cannot be invested in production and expand production. At the same time, it affects the normal supply and demand relationship of wheat. The instability of wheat prices in the Shijiazhuang market, Hebei, is inseparable from the competition of cotton farmers to purchase wheat. In addition, it also affects the wheat purchasing work of state-owned trading companies and affects the supply of wheat for cities and industry.

What attitude should we take towards this phenomenon?

On the one hand, we should appropriately meet the needs of cotton farmers for wheat or flour for consumption; on the other hand, we must educate farmers so that they understand the harm of hoarding wheat to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Some areas take the simple method of accommodating cotton farmers without educating them, raising the political awareness of farmers, and simply emphasizing that selling cotton to buy wheat is a "law" that cannot be changed, which is wrong. The cadres of the cooperative in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, once said: "Completing the task is not a problem, but there must be 2 million jin of wheat." That is to say, we must meet the needs of cotton farmers to hoard wheat in order to purchase cotton. Obviously, they do not pay attention to or believe in the effectiveness of political mobilization. Some individual cadres even wrongly incited cotton farmers to sell cotton and hoard wheat to get rich. The Communist Party Branch Secretary of Yangji Township and the cadres of the cooperative in Bin County, Shandong, even said when mobilizing cotton farmers to sell cotton: "If you sell cotton to the country now and buy grain with the money, and then exchange it for cotton in the autumn, won't you get rich several times over?" This kind of propaganda with a purely economic point of view is extremely harmful and must be corrected immediately.

While persuading farmers to stop hoarding wheat, we should encourage them to purchase new production tools, add livestock, increase fertilizer, raise funds to repair canals, dig wells, and buy water wheels to produce more grain and industrial raw materials. This approach is beneficial to the country and to the farmers themselves. In the supply work in coordination with cotton purchasing, state-owned trading departments should supply cotton farmers with the production materials and living materials they need in many ways, and regard the supply of wheat as only a part of the supply of materials (part of the flour can also be supplied). The current supply and demand situation in cotton-producing areas such as Hebei is: cotton farmers need a large quantity (such as fertilizer, coal, etc.) and many types, but we supply a small quantity and few types. This should be quickly remedied.

Cannot Rely Solely on Material Supply, Should Pay Attention to Mobilizing Farmers to Store Cotton

Because some materials (such as wheat) are still in short supply, it is difficult to fully meet the requirements of cotton farmers. Moreover, the tendency of farmers to sell cotton and hoard wheat should also be prevented. Therefore, it is also necessary to pay attention to mobilizing farmers to store cotton, reduce currency issuance and the amount of materials needed. Experience has proved that as long as the method of storing cotton is explained to cotton farmers, many cotton farmers are willing to store cotton for the country.

The State Bank has launched a patriotic savings campaign in cotton-producing areas, which has been done better in East China. In the first thirteen days of June, cotton farmers in Fuqiao District, Taicang, Southern Jiangsu, sold a total of 63,000 jin of seed cotton, and stored more than 97.3 million yuan of cotton money in the bank, accounting for 45.6 percent of the total cotton sales. In the first thirteen days of June, cotton farmers in Nanhui, Shanghai, Chuansha, and other counties in Southern Jiangsu sold a total of 11,024 dan of cotton and deposited 503.09 million yuan in the bank for capital preservation and value preservation deposits. This practice should be quickly promoted to other cotton areas.

At the same time, the proportion of cotton storage should also be consciously increased, so that cotton farmers who do not need money immediately can store cotton in state-designated economic organs for future needs, and do not need to rush to buy wheat. According to the situation in some areas, because cadres are afraid of trouble, they emphasize spot purchases, and the ratio of cotton purchasing to cotton storage is very different. According to rough statistics, as of early July, cotton storage in Hebei Province accounted for only 1.5 percent of the total amount of cotton received. Xingtai Prefecture in the province accounted for only 0.5 percent. Lingbao Prefecture in Henan Province accounted for 3 percent, and Huimin in Shandong accounted for 9 percent. Is it that cotton farmers are certainly unwilling to store cotton? No. Several facts prove that the quantity of cotton storage has increased significantly in areas where farmers are consciously mobilized to store cotton. For example, in Hecun Village, Cheng'an County, Hebei, when the significance of patriotic cotton storage was not publicized and the specific methods were not introduced in June, cotton storage accounted for only 4 percent of the total amount of cotton collected in the whole month; but from July 1st to July 8th, after the working group of the province explained the significance and methods of cotton storage in detail in the village, the proportion of cotton storage increased to 52 percent. This is enough to prove that cotton farmers can accept the method of cotton storage. The problem lies in whether we do a good and patient job of propaganda and mobilization so that they understand the significance and specific methods of patriotic cotton storage. In this way, the supply work can be more focused on the most urgently needed materials, and the excessive currency issuance can be avoided, causing price fluctuations.

　　关于购棉中的物资供应工作
    赵近宇　康伟中
    在购棉工作中，作好物资供应工作是重要的环节之一。因为农民在出售棉花之后，需要购进必需的生活资料与生产资料。这种需要如能予以适当的满足，农民是乐意售棉的。因此，把政治动员工作与物资供应工作结合起来，是十分重要的。平原省安阳县在购棉储棉工作中，接受农民要求，各经济部门联合组织了若干购棉储棉小组，携带了足够的粮票、煤票、现款等，深入农村，把物资供应与政治动员结合起来，购棉储棉工作就进行得比较顺利。据十一个收购小组四天的统计，即收购皮棉达十二万斤。相反的，如果物资供应不及时，棉农就会发生疑虑，影响购棉储棉任务的完成。安阳县上毛义涧收棉站因事先缺乏足够准备，棉农卖棉后要粮票无粮票，要钱无钱，棉农都很怀疑，结果影响了购棉工作的开展。
    目前物资供应工作存在的问题
    目前在物资供应工作中存在着些什么问题呢？
    第一，有些地区的县、区党政干部，认为物资供应工作只是经济部门的事，因而放弃或放松了对这一工作的领导。如平原省新乡专区的某些县份的领导干部，强调工作太忙，顾不过来，认为物资供应工作由经济部门去作就可以了，因而没有积极领导、检查。结果，各种物资放在购棉站，等待棉农来买；农民因农事太忙，无暇来买，购棉工作干部就认为棉农不需要物资，因此也不设法运货下乡，结果收购成绩很不好。山东德州专区吴桥县，因麦子供应不上，六月中旬麦价每斤上升至一千二百元。连镇七月上旬麦价也升至一千一百五十元。此外棉农迫切需要的手电筒、自行车、竹壳暖水瓶、各种花布，也因供应不上，发生抢购的现象。另外，有的地方把购棉储棉的动员工作与物资供应工作机械地分开，区村干部只负责宣传、动员，棉农需要什么物资则不去过问；经济部门只管供应物资，也不主动与政治动员工作相结合。这些都阻碍了购棉储棉任务的完成。
    第二，有的地区的经济部门干部，对棉农卖出棉花后的物资需要缺乏调查了解，以致棉农需要的没有供应，不需要的则供应很多，造成供求失调的现象。如苏北棉区棉农卖棉后迫切需要木材和元麦，启东地区需要中白米，但该地有关的国营专业公司却不尽力设法调运该项物资，结果引起木材、元麦价格上涨。河北石家庄专区农民需要肥料、碱面及百货等；邯郸专区需要胶皮轮、自行车、玻璃、袜子、球鞋；河南产棉区需要大批日用百货，都因为缺乏该项物资而形成市场抢购现象，使购棉工作受到妨碍。河北成安县棉农不需要红高粱，但县粮食公司却运去很多红高粱，对购棉无大作用。
    此外，各经济部门之间互相配合、联系不够，对购棉储棉工作也有不好的影响。如平原省合作社与省花纱布公司因印制麦粮期票的手续费问题争持不下，粮票停留在合作社达十天之久。省粮食公司与花纱布公司因在粮食作价问题上未能取得一致意见，几次协议都没有成功。这些都影响了购棉任务的完成。苏北区各经济部门由于步调不统一，互相没有配合，致造成私商乘隙抬价抢购、囤积，一个半月，公司只完成购储总任务的百分之二十弱。河南淮阳老冢收棉站，各经济单位不密切配合下乡以物资换购棉花，仅是“坐房等客”，至七月中旬统计，仅完成全任务的百分之十八点四。这都说明，各经济部门如不密切结合，采取便利农民的办法，购棉储棉任务是不能完成的。
    做好供应工作应注意的事项
    怎样才能做好物资供应的工作呢？
    首先，各地产棉区的党政及经济部门领导机关，必须从思想上重视这一工作。必须认识：政治发动与物资供应二者是缺一不可的。只有政治发动，而没有物资供应，棉农的生活与生产资料的需要不能适当满足，一方面会使棉农不相信我们，另方面还会发生物价波动。山东宁津一带的棉农见到我们干部时说：“你们动员我们卖棉花时，说棉花卖出后要豆饼有豆饼，要粮食有粮食；现在是要啥没啥。”这说明，缺乏必要的物资供应，购棉储棉工作会受严重影响。为克服这种现象，各地产棉区领导机关应自上而下地组织检查小组，及时地、巡回地到各地检查物资准备情况和供应情况，作到物资品质与数量均能大体满足棉农的需要，且要处处便利棉农。西北区中国花纱布公司现已组成两个检查小组分别到咸阳、泾阳、三原、渭南、临潼和大荔等棉产区检查工作，以解决各该地区的物资准备与各经济部门的相互配合问题。平原省安阳地委和专署专门组织几个干部巡回检查，发现和解决了物资供应中的一些具体问题，作用很大。这种办法证明是比较有效的。
    其次，各有关经济部门必须步调一致，密切配合，作到处处便利农民。过去的经验证明，凡是物资供应充足和便利农民购买的地方，购棉储棉任务就会进行得较快。河南淮阳百货公司与当地花纱布公司合组成购棉推销小组，携带大量布匹与百货，深入农村收购棉花，受到很多棉农欢迎。购棉推销小组在二十天内收购五万多斤。苏北海复镇百货公司一天销货额达二千余万元。河北定县西瓦房、清风店村棉农需要肥料，供销社购来八万斤豆饼，以豆饼换棉，一天换到棉花一千三百多斤。河北南宫县二十四个收棉站都准备了大量布匹、粮食、百货、土产，各公司为便利农民，推行连环业务，并委托村合作社代销。这样，该县四十天内购棉就达到九十万斤。
            关于小麦的供应问题
    在此次购棉储棉工作中，棉农卖棉后大量买麦是多数产棉区比较普遍的现象。大量买麦的原因之一，是棉农生活水平提高了，需要细粮。但更主要的原因，则是有些棉农想囤积麦子谋利。河北省商业厅在“关于购棉储棉工作报告”中说：“各地多要求大量供应小麦，仅邯郸专区即要二千万斤，主要原因是棉农售棉后以小麦做为储蓄手段；另一方面是棉麦比价不合理，南部棉区一斤棉换麦八斤十四两，超过换麦八斤半的规定，刺激棉农囤麦。”山东德州专区有的棉农反映：“不用动员，只要合作社有麦子，我们就有棉花。”平原新乡七里营有的棉农说：“不管你说什么，反正我有个老主意：不见兔子不放鹰（意思就是拿不到麦子不卖棉花）。”石家庄国家收麦机构因为棉农购麦数量巨大，两次退出市场。其他地区，也有类似情形发生。
    棉农囤麦的原因，主要是过去麦、棉的季节差价太大。在麦收之后卖棉买麦，在新棉上市以后卖麦买棉，一进一出，可以得到不少利润。特别是去年由于国营贸易公司没有准确地掌握小麦价格，使部分地区出现过“斤棉斗麦”的不合理比价（河北、河南、山东、平原都发生过）。棉农因而发生一种错觉，认为今年一定仍会如此。另外，若干农民中还有错误的重物轻币心理，卖棉后不愿存储货币，担心货币还会贬值。
    由于农民卖棉后大量囤麦，便把大量资金冻结了起来，不能投入生产，扩大生产。同时影响了小麦的正常供求关系。河北石家庄市场麦价几度失稳，是与棉农争购小麦分不开的。另外，也多少影响了国营贸易公司的购麦工作，影响到对城市及工业用麦的供应。
    对这种现象应持什么态度呢？
    一方面，应当适当满足棉农食用所需的小麦或面粉；另一方面，必须对农民进行教育，使他们认识大量囤麦对国计民生的为害。有些地区采取单纯的迁就棉农的办法，不进行教育，提高农民的政治觉悟，单纯强调卖棉买麦是“规律”，不能改变，这是不对的。河北武安县合作社的干部曾表示：“完成任务不成问题，但是得有二百万斤麦子。”也就是说，必须满足棉农囤麦的要求，才能购到棉花。显然，他们是不注意也不相信政治动员的效力的。还有个别干部甚至错误地教唆棉农卖棉囤麦，发家致富。山东滨县杨集乡中共乡支部书记与合作社干部，在动员棉农售棉时竟说：“你现在把棉花卖给国家，把钱买成粮食，秋后再换成棉花，翻几翻不就发财了吗？”这种单纯经济观点的宣传，是极端有害的，必须立即纠正。
    在说服农民停止囤麦的同时，应鼓励他们购置新的生产工具，添购牲畜，增加肥料，集资修渠、打井、买水车，生产更多的粮食和工业原料。这种做法，对国家、对农民自己，都是有利的。国营贸易部门在配合购棉的供应工作中，应多方面地供应棉农所需的生产资料和生活资料，把供应小麦只做为供应物资中的一部分（也可供应部分面粉）。现在河北等地棉区的供求情况是：棉农需要的数量大（如肥料、煤炭等）、种类多，但是我们供应的则是数量小、种类少。这是应该迅速补救的。
            不能单纯依靠物资供应  应该注意动员农民储棉
    由于若干物资（如小麦）还有供不应求之势，要全部满足棉农的要求也是困难的。而且，农民卖棉囤麦的偏向也是应当防止的。因此，动员棉农储存棉花，减少货币投放和物资的需要量，也是必须注意的。经验证明，只要将储棉的办法向棉农讲清楚，有许多棉农是愿意把棉花储存给国家的。
    国家银行在棉产区开展爱国储蓄运动，以华东区做的较好。苏南太仓浮桥区棉农在六月上旬十三天中，共售出籽棉六万三千斤，存储到银行的棉款九千七百三十余万元，占总售棉款的百分之四十五点六。苏南南汇、上海、川沙等县棉农在六月上旬十三天中共售棉一万一千零二十四担，向银行存储保本保值存款五亿零三百零九万元。这种作法，应该迅速推广到其他棉区。
    与此同时，还应有意识地增加储棉的比重，使不立即用款的棉农把棉花存储到国家指定的经济机关，以备不时之需，不必急于购麦。根据若干地区的情况，因干部怕麻烦，强调现购，购棉与储棉的比重是相差很远的。据粗略统计，截至七月上旬，河北全省储棉仅占收进棉花总额的百分之一点五。该省邢台专区仅占百分之零点五。河南灵宝专区占百分之三，山东惠民占百分之九。是不是棉农一定不肯储棉呢？不是的。若干事实证明：凡是有意识地动员农民储棉的地区，储棉的数量也就有显著地增加。譬如河北成安县河町村，在六月份没有宣传爱国储棉的意义和介绍具体办法的时候，全月的收棉总数中储棉仅占百分之四；但在七月一日至七月八日该省工作组在该村把储棉的意义和办法详细解释以后，储棉的比重增加到百分之五十二。这足以证明棉农是可以接受储棉的办法的。问题在于我们是否很好地耐心地进行宣传动员，使他们明白爱国储棉的意义和具体办法。这样，供应工作也就可以更集中于最迫切需要的物资，而且可以避免货币投放太多，引起物价的动荡。
