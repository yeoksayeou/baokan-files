　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The Executive Committee of the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions issued a statement on July 28, supporting the resolution of the Vienna meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, calling on Japanese workers to unite and strive for peace.
    The statement said: We fully support the resolution of the Executive Bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions. We must materialize these resolutions in Japan and further promote the World Federation of Trade Unions movement. To this end, we must:
    (1) Disseminate the resolutions of the Executive Bureau meeting among Japanese workers, explaining that only the World Federation of Trade Unions accepts the demands of Japanese workers and assists workers in their struggle for peace and independence.
    (2) Oppose the rearmament of Japan and a separate peace treaty, and strive to conclude an overall peace treaty with Japan within the year. In particular, oppose the one-sided "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" and the so-called "peace conference" to be held in San Francisco.
    (3) Strengthen the current peace struggle and launch a nationwide peace movement. At the same time, demand higher wages, oppose intensified labor, layoffs, rising prices, and the undermining of labor laws, and call on all workers to rise up and take united action.

　　全日本产业别工会会议拥护世界工联决议
    反对重新武装日本要求全面缔和
    号召日本工人团结一致加强和平斗争
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：全日本产业别工会会议执行委员会在七月二十八日发表声明，拥护世界工会联合会执行局维也纳会议的决议，号召日本工人团结一致，争取和平。
    声明说：我们完全拥护世界工联执行局会议的决议。我们必须使这些决议在日本具体化，更进一步推动世界工联运动。为此，我们必须：
    （一）使执行局会议的决议普及到日本工人中间，说明唯有世界工联接受日本工人的要求，协助工人争取和平与独立的斗争。
    （二）反对重新武装日本与单独媾和，争取在年内缔结全面对日和约。特别反对片面的《对日和约草案》，以及将在旧金山召开的所谓“和会”。
    （三）加强进行目前的和平斗争，展开全民性的和平运动。同时，要求提高工资，反对强化劳动、裁员、提高物价与破坏劳动法规，并号召全体工人起来一致行动。
