Many Departments in Western Sichuan Overstep Organizational Boundaries and 滥发(Abuse) Statistical Forms, Causing Serious Chaos in Rural Governance Work

In some areas of Western Sichuan where land reform has been implemented, rural governments are experiencing serious chaos. One of the reasons for this phenomenon is the excessive issuance of statistical forms by various levels of government and organizations. According to investigations in Ganlu and Yunyin Townships, Jiajiang County, more than 60 types of statistical forms were received from 13 units in June and July alone. Many enterprises, such as department stores, also directly ordered township peasant associations to fill out forms. For example, on May 7th, Tangzhen Township in Dayi County received a joint notice from the Second District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the District People's Government, requiring them to complete 25 types of statistical forms and submit them to the district by May 12th. One of these forms was a statistical report on 26 items related to landlords' land, yield, furniture, farm tools, houses (street houses, thatched houses, tile houses, mansions), grain, building materials, water mills, cattle, pigs, orchards, forests, trees, bamboo gardens, etc., that should be confiscated. Each item had to be further divided into what was to be turned over to the public and where it was to be placed. On July 16th, the District People's Government forwarded another 12 types of forms, requiring them to be filled out and submitted within five days. According to township cadre Li Jincheng, the most difficult to fill out among these 12 forms was the "Statistical Table of Unlawful Landlord Households, Compensation Households, Reasons for Compensation, and Amount of Compensation." One column in the table asked "What unlawful acts were committed," further divided into items such as seizing tenant land,抢收(forcibly harvesting) rent, selling land, selling cattle, selling farm tools, selling furniture, cutting down trees, hiding guns and ammunition, destroying farm tools, destroying furniture, and riots, with each item further divided into the number of households and quantities. Because the township had already reported the total amount of landlord compensation during the earlier "compensation and punishment struggle," and now it was divided into so many items with no prior preparation, it was necessary to mobilize a large number of people to conduct separate investigations and statistics, converting each "quantity" into an amount of money to complete the form. However, the township was busy with production and other movements, and could not spare the people or time. What to do in order to submit the form on time? He said: "We can only '凑' (piece together the numbers to match the previously reported totals)." Another example is Ganjiang Township in Jiajiang County, which received a notice from the District People's Government on July 3rd, requiring them to report the marriage and divorce situation in the township by the 6th. This report was delayed until the 5th, when the clerk, Han Zhidu, pieced together a report based on some fragmented materials he usually understood, working all night.

The 滥发(abusive issuance) of forms seriously affected the production of the masses and village cadres. According to statistics, some village cadres had to lose more than ten days of work a month, and the masses had to attend five or six meetings each month, specifically to fill out forms for various departments. It was common for village cadres to work all night.

Therefore, on August 2nd, the Western Sichuan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Western Sichuan People's Administrative Office, and the Western Sichuan Military Region jointly issued a notice, resolutely correcting this bureaucratic work style of 滥发(abusing) forms without considering the production of the masses, and ordering the departments that 滥发(abused) statistical forms to conduct serious self-criticism and propose improvement measures.

### 川西很多部门超越组织滥发统计表格  造成乡村政权工作严重忙乱现象

　　川西很多部门超越组织滥发统计表格
    造成乡村政权工作严重忙乱现象
    川西已经实行土地改革的部分地区，乡村政权机关存在着严重忙乱现象。造成这种现象的原因之一，是各级机关团体滥发统计表格。据夹江县甘露、云吟两乡调查，仅六、七两月，即收到十三个单位发下的统计表格六十余种。许多企业部门，如百货公司，也都直接向乡农民协会下令填表。如大邑县唐镇乡在五月七日接到该县中共二区区委会及区人民政府的联合通知，限五月十二日填写二十五种统计表送区。其中有一种是统计应没收地主田亩、产量、家具、农具、房屋（街房、草房、瓦房、公馆）、粮食、建筑材料、水碾、耕牛、猪、果园、森林、树木、竹园……等二十六项的数字，每一项又要分那些归公，放在什么地方。七月十六日区人民政府又转下十二种表格，限五日内填报。据乡干部李锦城反映，这十二种表格中，最难填的，是其中的“乡不法地主户数、赔偿户数、赔偿原因、赔偿数目统计表”。该表内有一栏叫“有那些不法行为”，内分夺佃、抢收租、出卖田地、出卖耕牛、出卖农具、出卖家具、砍伐树木、隐藏枪弹、破坏农具、破坏家具、暴乱等项，每项又分户数和数量。因为该乡早在“赔罚斗争”时，即将地主赔罚总金额呈报过，现在分成了这么多项目，早先没有准备，势必动员大批人员分头调查统计，将各项“数量”折成金额，才能填写。但该乡正忙于生产等运动，抽不出人来，也没有充裕的时间。为了如期送上，怎么办呢？他说：“只好逗”（把数字逗拢，符合呈报过的总数）。又如夹江县甘江乡在七月三日接到区人民政府通知，限六日前将该乡结婚离婚的情况报告上去。这个报告一直拖到五日，才由文书干事韩制度凭他平常了解的一些零碎材料，熬夜拼凑，写成了一篇报告。
    滥发表格，严重地影响了群众和村干部的生产。据统计，有些村干部一月要误十几天工，群众每月要参加五、六次会议，专门为各部门填表。村干部熬夜，通宵工作，是常事。
    为此，中共川西区委员会、川西人民行政公署、川西军区于八月二日发出联合通知，坚决纠正这种不考虑群众生产、滥发表格的官僚主义作风，并责成滥发统计表格的各部门，认真进行检讨，提出改进办法。
