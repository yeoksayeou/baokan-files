The state-owned Jingxi Mining Bureau, in accordance with the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee's notice on strictly inspecting capital construction projects, conducted an inspection of the bureau's capital construction projects from 1949 to 1951. Over the past two years, the bureau's capital construction projects have achieved certain results, but waste has been very serious. The reasons for this waste are due to insufficient prior investigation and research, inadequate planning and design, and blind construction.

The No. 3 inclined shaft of the Heishan Mine under the bureau's jurisdiction was put into construction without a detailed survey of the geological conditions and underground water volume. In August 1949, in order to urgently solve the winter coal shortage, it was excavated about 1,000 meters northwest of Xiaobaishan in Mentougou. The No. 3 inclined shaft had to pass through a quicksand layer with a large amount of water inflow, and the excavation speed was very slow. By the spring of 1950, it had only been excavated 82 meters, but no coal had been found yet. Therefore, the excavation of the No. 3 inclined shaft did not solve the winter coal supply problem in 1949. In April 1950, due to excessive rainfall, the No. 3 inclined shaft was flooded. Work was resumed after 40 days of drainage. In July, during the rainy season, the No. 3 inclined shaft was again flooded and work was suspended. Production was not resumed until December 1950. However, during the excavation, it was discovered that the western part of the No. 3 inclined shaft was directly connected to a small kiln, and the coal seam was not very regular; although the coal seam in the eastern and lower parts was better, it would affect the development of the No. 1 and No. 2 inclined shaft projects. Based on the above situation, it was decided to stop the project and start backfilling. By the beginning of July this year, most of the recoverable coal had been extracted; again, due to rainfall, the water inflow in the well increased sharply, and the machinery was withdrawn, and the well was abandoned. According to statistics, this well was in operation for less than two years from excavation to abandonment, producing a total of about 30,000 tons of coal, and the cost was offset by the selling price. However, the excavation costs of this well and other auxiliary building equipment and electromechanical installation projects have not been recovered, and the estimated loss is more than 300,000 catties of millet.

In July 1949, No. 1 and No. 2 inclined shafts were also excavated in the Heishan Mine. The excavation of these two inclined shafts was also to solve the coal shortage problem in the winter of that year. At that time, it was only seen that small kilns were producing coal there, and without investigation and research, No. 1 and No. 2 inclined shafts were excavated 500 meters northwest of Xiaobaishan. The initial plan was to mine coal as soon as it was found, but later, because the quicksand layer had a lot of water and excavation was difficult, and the winter coal shortage had passed, the plan was changed to deepen the shafts and convert them into permanent projects. However, it was also found that it was not easy to support the quicksand layer, and the water volume was large, so concrete lining was required to consolidate it. In the summer of 1950, the two wells were flooded and work was suspended. It was not until January 1951 that work resumed. The two wells were shut down for about four and a half months, and the workers' maintenance costs (only doing odd jobs during the shutdown period) were about 200,000 catties of millet. In addition, as soon as these two wells started construction, two large winch bases were made with stones and concrete, costing 80,000 catties of millet each. Later, the plan was changed to deepen the wellbore, one car seat was barely usable after modification, and the other was completely abandoned and had to be demolished.

Other mines and factories under the bureau's jurisdiction also had waste caused by inadequate design and hasty construction. For example, buildings were constructed without measuring the foundation, resulting in collapses; inaccurate excavation measurements resulted in bending and rework; and improper machine installation resulted in relocation, etc.

The reasons for the serious errors in the Heishan Mine project of the bureau are: objectively, it was forced by urgent tasks such as the urgent need to produce coal and resettle unemployed workers, but the more important reason is that the administrative leaders have a serious small-scale production viewpoint, regard engineering construction as something that can be changed and moved at will, and lack a correct understanding of the policies and guidelines of industrial construction. The engineering and technical personnel are careless and have not adopted a cautious and scientific attitude towards capital construction. (Ma Ning)

　　京西矿务局检查基本建设
    因计划设计不周、盲目施工造成了不少浪费
    认识到以小生产观点对待工业建设必然失败
    国营京西矿务局根据政务院财政经济委员会关于严格检查基本建设工程的通知，对该局一九四九年到一九五一年的基本建设工程作了检查。二年来，该局基本建设工程有一定的成绩，但浪费非常严重。造成这些浪费的原因是由于事先调查研究不够，计划、设计不周和盲目施工。
    该局所属黑山矿的三号斜井，未经详细勘查地质情形及井下水量即行动工。在一九四九年八月间，因急于解决冬季煤荒问题，即在门头沟小黑山西北方面约一千公尺处开凿。三号斜井要经过流沙层，涌水量大，掘进速度甚慢。到一九五○年春季始掘进八十二公尺，但仍未出煤。因之，三号斜井的开凿，并未解决一九四九年冬季煤的供应问题。一九五○年四月，雨水过大，三号斜井被淹。经四十天的排水，才恢复工作。七月雨季时，三号斜井又被淹停工。直至一九五○年十二月才恢复生产。但在掘进中，又发觉三号斜井西部与小窑直接贯通，且煤层不甚规则；东部及下部虽煤层较好，又将影响一、二号斜井工程的发展。根据上述情况，决定工程停止进行，开始回采。到今年七月初，可以回采的煤，大部已经采出；又逢下雨，井下涌水量骤增，即将机械撤出，将该井废弃。据统计，此井自开凿至废弃为期不及两年，产煤共约三万吨，成本与售价相抵。但这个井的凿掘费用及其他附属建筑设备、机电安装工程没有收回，估计损失约在三十万斤小米以上。
    一九四九年七月，在黑山矿还开凿了一、二号斜井。开凿这两个斜井也是为了解决当年冬季煤荒问题。当时只见有小窑在该处出煤，未经调查研究，就在小黑山西北五百公尺处，开凿了一、二号斜井。最初计划是见煤就采，后来因为流沙层水大，掘进困难，而冬季煤荒已过，乃改变计划，将井凿深，改作永久工程。但又发觉流砂层内支柱不易，而水量又大，必须砌洋灰?，才能巩固。一九五○年夏季，两井被淹停工。直到一九五一年一月才又复工。二井停工约四个半月之久，工人维持费（停工期间只做些杂活）约二十万斤小米。另外，此二井刚一开工，就用石头、洋灰做了两个大绞车座，每个费小米八万斤。后来改变计划井筒掘深，一个车座改修后勉强能用，一个完全废弃，须要拆除。
    该局所属其他矿厂，也都有因设计不周，草率施工而造成浪费的情况。比如建筑房屋不测量地基，以致倒塌；掘进测量不精，发生弯曲返工；机器安装不当，改挪位置等。
    该局黑山矿工程发生严重错误的原因：在客观上是为急欲出煤和安置失业工人等紧急任务所迫使，但更主要的还是行政领导干部存在着严重的小生产观点，把工程建设看作可以随便改变移动的，对工业建设的政策与方针缺乏正确的认识。工程技术人员则粗枝大叶，对基本建设未采取慎重的、科学的态度。（马宁）
