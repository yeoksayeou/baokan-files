Frequent Design Changes and Insufficient Preparation Plans
Lai Town Engineering Team's Construction Project Plunged into Chaos
The construction engineering team of the Lai Town Section Engineering Office of the Hengyang Railway Bureau has been established for over three months since April 16th, but not a single house has been built yet. Although this serious problem has attracted the attention of the Lai Town Engineering Office and the construction engineering team, the problem has not been well resolved.

The construction tasks undertaken by the construction engineering team are quite large, with plans to build more than 51,000 square meters of houses in the second half of this year, accounting for one-half of the houses built by the Lai Town Engineering Office. Such a large project is being carried out blindly without preparation or planning. The engineering office did not clearly explain the tasks assigned to the engineering team. First, it was said that more than 10,000 square meters of houses were to be built, and then in mid-May, it was said to be more than 50,000 square meters. Layout and design drawings were not issued in a timely manner. Responsible cadres of the construction engineering team did not clearly convey the tasks assigned by the higher authorities and started work hastily. During the construction process, although the design section of the engineering office's engineering division issued some design drawings, they were very scattered and changed frequently. For example, the budget and drawings for the railway middle school were changed twice, and the budget and drawings for the dormitory were changed three times. Moreover, drawings were often received in the morning and work had to start in the afternoon. For example, the design drawings for the railway primary school were issued on July 5th, and work had to start on the 6th. Because there was no time to allocate workers and prepare materials, serious waste and chaos occurred.

The preparatory work for the project was done very poorly. For example, transportation lines (railways, highways, etc.) were not repaired in time beforehand, which dragged on for more than a month. There was no unified plan for on-site layout and material allocation, which made it impossible to transport materials to the site, affecting the progress of the project. The engineering office did not arrange the site well, and the materials were not delivered, so more than 1,800 workers from the Hunan (Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan) Construction Workers' Union were invited (originally planned for 1,200 people). Moreover, two-thirds of the workers to be invited should have been masons and one-third carpenters, but two-thirds of the workers who came were carpenters and one-third were masons (the Hunan Construction Workers' Union should also bear some responsibility for this). As a result, there were too many people and too little work on the project, and more than half of the 2,000 workers had no work or could only work part-time. The supply of materials also failed to keep pace with the progress of the project. The projects that had started lacked flagstones and lime. Houses with erected roof frames could not be tiled without rubber sheets, and there were no adobe bricks to complete the work. Materials that were not urgently needed for the current project and could arrive later were shipped in large quantities. For example, more than 600 tons of cement were shipped in, and there were problems with the storage space. This is also one of the reasons for the stoppage of work and waiting for materials.

Regarding the leadership ideology of the construction engineering team and the work attitude of the technical personnel, there are the following problems:

Administrative leaders of the construction engineering team have a sense of irresponsibility and fear of taking responsibility. They do not have a correct grasp and understanding of the overall work and cannot rationally allocate and use manpower and materials according to the actual situation. Among the leading cadres, there is a serious existence of clericalism and old-fashioned work styles. They are unable to solve issues of principle well and often get entangled in trivial issues. They are not good at consulting with the masses on problems (the workers still do not know which houses the construction engineering team is going to build). As a result, they are busy all day long, but the project is proceeding without planning or preparation.

Most of the technical personnel have departmentalism. In their work, they only care about doing their own work well, and other people's affairs have nothing to do with them, forming a state of clear division of labor but lack of close contact. Engineers always demand more labor and more materials, without taking care of the entire project and without distinguishing between priorities. There is a stoppage of work and waiting for materials here, but there are materials lying unused there, which hinders the progress of the project unnecessarily. There is also a purely technical viewpoint among the technical personnel, and they do not know how to organize and lead the workers to solve the difficulties in production. For example, when mobilizing workers (carpenters) to transport materials, an engineer actually said: "If you don't transport, you won't have work!" The result of doing so is only to arouse the workers' resentment, making them unwilling to assist the engineers in solving the difficulties in production.

### 设计经常改变，施工中准备计划不够  来镇工程队建筑工程陷入混乱状态

　　设计经常改变，施工中准备计划不够
    来镇工程队建筑工程陷入混乱状态
    衡阳铁路管理局来镇段工程处建筑工程队自四月十六日成立至今已三个多月了，要建筑的房子却连一间还未盖成。这个严重问题虽然已引起来镇工程处与建筑工程队的注意，但问题尚未能得到很好的解决。
    建筑工程队所负建筑任务是相当大的，计划在今年下半年盖五万一千多平方公尺的房子，占来镇工程处所盖房子的二分之一。这样大的工程却无准备无计划地盲目施工。工程处没有把给工程队的任务交代清楚。先说要修一万多平方公尺的房子，到五月中旬又说是五万多平方公尺，布置图及设计图都没及时发下。建筑工程队负责干部也没有明确地传达上级交代的任务，就仓促地开了工。在施工中，工程处工务组设计科虽发下一些设计图，但是非常零星，而且变更很多。如铁路中学的预算和图样变过二次，宿舍的预算和图样变过三次。并且常常上午拿到图下午就要开工。如铁路小学的设计图七月五日发下，六日便要开工。因为来不及分配工人与准备材料，造成了严重的浪费与混乱现象。
    工程的准备工作做得很差。如交通线（铁路、公路等）事先不抓紧时间修通，整拖了一个多月；工地布置材料调配都没有统一计划，使材料无法运至工地，影响了工程进展。工程处没把工地布置好，材料也没有运来，便先把湖南（长沙、株州、湘潭）建筑工会的工友请来一千八百多名（原计划一千二百人）。而且要请的工人中应该是泥瓦工三分之二，木工三分之一，请来的工人中却有三分之二是木工，三分之一是泥瓦工（对这事湖南建筑工会也应负一部分责任）。结果形成工程上人多事少，二千来工人中有半数以上无工作或只能半工作。供应材料也不能配合工程的进度。已开工的缺片石、少石灰，树好屋架的房屋没橡皮不能盖瓦，没有土坯，不能完工。当前工程不急需的，可以晚到的材料却大批运来。如洋灰运来六百多吨，堆放的地方都成问题。这也是造成停工待料的原因之一。
    在建筑工程队的领导思想与技术人员工作态度方面，有以下问题：
    建筑工程队行政领导干部，有不负责与怕负责任的思想，对全盘工作没有正确掌握与了解，不能根据现实情况合理地分配与使用人力、物力。在领导干部中严重地存在着事务主义与老一套的工作作风，不能很好地解决原则问题，常在枝节问题上纠缠不清；有问题不善于找群众商量（工人群众到现在还不知道建筑工程队要盖那些房子），因之整天忙得不可开交，而工程却在无计划无准备地进行着。
    技术人员中，绝大多数有本位主义思想。他们在工作中只管将自己分内工作搞好就算，别人的事与我无关，形成了分工明确而联系不密切的状态。工程师们总是劳动力也多要，材料也多要，不照顾整个工程，不分轻重缓急。这里停工待料，那里却有材料放着不用，使工程的进展遭受不应有的阻挠。技术人员中还存在着单纯技术观点，不懂得去组织领导工人群众解决生产中的困难。如动员工人（木工）运料时，有位工程师竟然说：“你不运便没有工作！”这样做的结果，只有引起工人的反感，使他们不愿意协助工程师解决生产中的困难。
                                              （张扬白、卢增善）
