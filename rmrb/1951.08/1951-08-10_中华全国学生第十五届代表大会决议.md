The 15th National Congress of the All-China Students' Federation has been convened more than two years since the 14th National Congress. During this period, the People's Republic of China has been proclaimed. Our newborn motherland has achieved unprecedented progress and development in all aspects. Under the direct leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the Chinese student movement has also achieved unprecedented progress and development, becoming an important force in the great construction cause of the new China.

The 15th National Congress of the All-China Students' Federation believes that the main tasks of the current Chinese student movement are as follows:

	I. Strive to popularize and deepen patriotic ideological education among students nationwide. That is, we should continue to promote the patriotic tradition of Chinese students in the past, unite students nationwide on the basis of the Common Program, draw a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution, and resolutely oppose the remaining forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China and their ideological influence. The new China, with the people's democratic dictatorship based on the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, has established the most progressive and superior state and social system in the history of our country. It has opened up infinitely bright prospects for the Chinese people and Chinese students. Students nationwide should deeply recognize the different essence between the new and old China, the greatness and loveliness of the new China, inspire their high patriotic enthusiasm, and serve the motherland; and make this high patriotic enthusiasm a constant driving force for our work and study.

	In order to deepen patriotic ideological education, students should be encouraged to study Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought diligently. Only by using the weapon of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought can we overcome the various old influences that have invaded our minds and establish a completely correct and firm patriotic ideology.

	II. Unite students nationwide, and on the basis of patriotic ideology, strive to improve their knowledge level. Only by firmly grasping knowledge can we more effectively serve the motherland's national defense construction, economic construction, and cultural construction.

	III. Actively carry out sports, cultural, and recreational activities in schools, and strive to improve the health of students nationwide. Every student should have a strong physique and be able to cope with intensive study and heavy work.

	In order to meet the needs of the motherland's national defense construction, military sports activities should be promoted.

	IV. Strengthen the work of student federations at all levels and student unions in various schools. Student federations at all levels and student unions in various schools should, under the guidance of educational administrative departments at all levels, closely cooperate with the Communist Youth League organizations and work together to effectively help students carry out political and ideological study and the study of cultural and scientific knowledge, improve their health, and carry out other work to improve the welfare of all students.

Students nationwide should also unite more widely and closely under the banner of patriotism, advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and strive to build our new democratic China and fight for the bright future of socialism and communism in China!

　　中华全国学生第十五届代表大会决议
    从中华全国学生第十四届代表大会召开到现在，已经两年多了。在这段时间内，中华人民共和国已经宣告成立。我们新生的祖国在各方面都获得了空前的进步和发展。在中国共产党和人民政府的直接领导教育下，中国学生运动也获得了空前的进步和发展，成为新中国伟大建设事业中的一支重要力量。
    中华全国学生第十五届代表大会认为现在中国学生运动的主要任务如下：
    一、在全国同学中努力普及与加深爱国主义的思想教育，那就是应该继续发扬中国学生过去的爱国传统，使全国同学在共同纲领的基础上团结起来，划清革命与反革命的界限，坚决反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的残余力量及其思想影响。以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的新中国，建立了我国有史以来最进步最优越的国家制度和社会制度，它为中国人民和中国学生开辟了无限远大的前程。全国同学应该深切地认识新中国和旧中国的不同的本质，新中国的伟大和可爱，鼓舞起自己高度的爱国热情，为祖国服务；并使这种高度的爱国热情，成为经常推动我们工作与学习的动力。
    为要加深爱国主义的思想教育，应该提倡同学们努力学习马克思、列宁主义——毛泽东思想。只有运用马克思、列宁主义——毛泽东思想的武器，才能战胜侵入我们思想中的各种旧影响，确立完全正确的坚定的爱国主义思想。
    二、团结全国同学，在爱国主义的思想基础上，努力提高自己的知识水平。只有牢固地掌握知识，才能使我们更有效地为祖国的国防建设、经济建设及文化建设事业服务。
    三、积极开展学校中的体育和文化、娱乐活动，努力改进全国同学的健康状况。要使每一个同学都具有强健的体魄，能够胜任紧张的学习和繁重的工作。
    为了适应祖国国防建设的需要，应该注意提倡军事体育活动。
    四、加强各级学生联合会和各校学生会的工作，各级学生联合会和各校学生会应该在各级教育行政部门的指导下，与青年团组织密切配合，协同工作，以便有效地帮助同学开展政治思想学习和文化科学知识的学习，改善健康情况及进行其他增进全体同学福利的工作。
    全国同学还要更广泛、更紧密地团结在爱国主义的旗帜下，向着毛主席指示的方向前进，为建设我们新民主主义的中国，并为争取中国的社会主义与共产主义的光明前途而斗争！
