　　【Our Newspaper's Report】The people of various provinces and cities in the Central-South Region, Tianjin, Tangshan in Hebei Province, the Southern Jiangsu Region, the Southern Anhui Region, Shaanxi Province, and the various ethnic groups in Qamdo are continuing to carry out the production increase and donation movement. The people of the Central-South Region, Tianjin, Tangshan, and other places have already started to pay their donations and are launching publicity campaigns to strive for the early completion of the production increase and donation plan.

　　Since July 18th, the number of airplanes donated by the people of various provinces and cities in the Central-South Region has increased by nine. Wuhan City has donated an additional two aircraft, Guangdong Province an additional four, and Hunan Province an additional three. The total number of aircraft that the Central-South Region has now decided to donate is 578. Various provinces and cities in the region have started making payments. According to incomplete statistics as of now, the region has paid a total of 70.1 billion RMB. This includes 21.2 billion in Hubei Province, 13 billion in Guangdong Province, 12.55 billion in Hunan Province, 5.8 billion in Jiangxi Province, 5.5 billion in Guangxi Province, 7.75 billion in Henan Province, and 4.3 billion in Wuhan City. In order to strive for the early completion of the second half-year production increase and donation plan, anti-American and aid-Korea organizations in various places in the region are now combining current affairs education, inspection and revision of patriotic pledges, and further carrying out publicity and mobilization work among the masses of all social strata.

　　The people of all circles in Tianjin enthusiastically pay donations for weapons. According to the statistics of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China on the 15th, the bank has collected more than 50.966 billion RMB in donations from people of all circles. The donations paid by workers in the city have reached more than 7.8 billion RMB. The industrial and commercial sectors have paid more than 27 billion RMB, of which the financial industry and the cotton yarn and silk industry have each pledged to donate two aircraft and have paid all the cash; the import and export industry has pledged to donate five aircraft and has paid more than 5.7 billion RMB. Women from all walks of life are actively paying for the "Tianjin Women's Aircraft." According to incomplete statistics, students' donations have reached 60 million RMB. Many students use their summer vacation to participate in social services or hold charity performances, and donate the income to purchase airplanes and cannons.

　　The people of all circles in Tangshan City have paid 6.56 billion RMB for the donation of airplanes and cannons, exceeding one-third of the total value of 12 fighter jets and one anti-aircraft gun pledged by the city. Many units in the city have formulated specific donation plans for this quarter based on the Tangshan Anti-American and Aid-Korea Branch's plan to complete the goal of donating six aircraft and one anti-aircraft gun in the third quarter of this year, and have generally revised the patriotic pledge, making production increase and donation one of the important contents of the patriotic pledge. The city's employees have now paid more than 2.28 billion RMB, completing and exceeding the quarter's plan by 40 percent in advance. Qixin Yanghui Factory in the city has paid 1.5 billion RMB.

　　The people of Southern Jiangsu have pledged to donate 122 aircraft and 400 million RMB (the donation figures for the counties in Zhenjiang Prefecture are not included), exceeding the target of donating a "Southern Jiangsu Air Force Division" of 120 aircraft. People from all walks of life have formulated production increase and donation plans. For example, Wuxi Shenxin No. 3 Factory plans to save and donate 2.3 billion RMB in terms of materials within half a year. Farmers in Jinshan County guarantee to donate 1.6 million catties of rice from a 10% increase in grain production. In the donation movement, Southern Jiangsu Region combined the implementation of the patriotic pledge with preferential treatment work, mobilized more than one million people in the region to listen to the reports of the representatives of the comfort delegation to North Korea, and carried out large-scale propaganda and education activities through studying the history of the Communist Party of China, thereby improving the political consciousness of the masses and enabling the production increase and donation movement to be carried out smoothly. However, in some places, it has been found that the donation is divorced from production increase, only pursuing figures, and there are deviations such as forced orders and average apportionments, which must be strengthened by leadership, fully carried out political mobilization and organizational work, and corrected in a timely manner.

　　According to incomplete statistics on August 20, the total payment in the Southern Anhui Region has reached 5.225 billion RMB, accounting for one-quarter of the donation plan in the Southern Anhui Region. After completing the production increase plan, workers and farmers in various places have paid in advance. Employees of Mingyuan Power Plant in Wuhu City have paid more than 14 million RMB, completing 94% of the half-year donation plan. Employees in the factory's machine room, repair room and other departments have donated all their overtime wages for one day each month, and also donated more than 880,000 RMB in production bonuses for July. Porters in Tunxi City donated half of the wages they earned from participating in road repairs. Farmers in the 32 mutual aid groups led by Luo Guangming, a famous agricultural labor model in Southern Anhui, donated 3.06 million RMB in wages they earned from cutting firewood during slack farming time, completing one-third of the half-year donation plan. The people of Huizhou Prefecture have paid more than 1.522 billion RMB, accounting for one-third of the half-year donation plan. Minsheng, Xiexin, and Jingxin three ice factories in Wuhu City have all paid off their half-year donations in advance.

　　As of August 15, the donation for airplanes and cannons paid by the people of all circles in Shaanxi Province has reached 7.7 billion RMB, completing 23% of the province's half-year donation plan. In the payment, employees in various places showed a high degree of patriotism. Employees of Xinsheng and Xinxing Coal Mines in Baishui County paid 3 million RMB from their increased production. Many mutual aid groups in rural areas also enthusiastically paid because they completed their production increase and donation plans. Two mutual aid groups in Shuaijia Village, Fufeng County, donated 1.5 million RMB in wages earned from weeding autumn seedlings and pushing manure. Seventy-nine women and twenty farmers in Baqiao Qixiang, Chang'an County, carried 50 tons of sand together and donated 30% of their wages. The industrial and commercial circles in Yan'an have now paid more than 100 million RMB with the increased income from improved operations.

　　The Tibetan, Han, Hui, and other ethnic groups in Qamdo are enthusiastically carrying out the weapon donation movement. People of all ethnic groups formally established a donation committee at the end of last month. In just two days from the 31st of last month to the 1st of this month, the total value of yak, highland barley, Tibetan silver, etc. donated by people of all ethnic groups was 90 million RMB. Bangda Duoji, member of the Southwest Military and Political Committee and deputy director of the Qamdo Regional People's Liberation Committee, took the lead in donating 1,000 dou of highland barley and 10 yaks; Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, deputy director of the Qamdo Regional People's Liberation Committee, and Sangye Wangdui, the ninth generation Bon official of the uprising Tibetan army, also donated huge sums of money.

    【本报讯】中南区各省市、天津市、河北省唐山市、苏南区、皖南区、陕西省人民以及昌都各民族人民，继续开展增产捐献运动。中南区、天津市及唐山市等地人民现已纷纷缴纳款项，并展开宣传运动，争取早日完成增产捐献计划。
    中南区各省市人民捐献飞机数目，自七月十八日以来又增加九架。计武汉市增献二架，广东省增献四架，湖南省增献三架。现在中南全区已决定捐献飞机总数共五百七十八架。该区各省市已开始缴款，截至目前为止的不完全统计，全区已缴纳人民币七百零一亿元。计湖北省二百十二亿，广东省一百三十亿，湖南省一百二十五亿五千余万元，江西省五十八亿，广西省五十五亿，河南省七十七亿五千万，武汉市四十三亿。该区各地抗美援朝组织，为争取早日完成下半年增产捐献计划，现正结合时事教育、检查与修订爱国公约，进一步在各阶层群众中开展宣传动员工作。
    天津市各界人民踊跃缴纳捐献武器的现款。据人民银行天津分行十五日统计，该行代收各界人民的捐款已达五百零九亿六千六百余万元。全市工人所缴捐款已有七十八亿余元。工商界已缴款二百七十余亿元，其中金融业、花纱布绸业各认捐飞机两架，均已全部缴纳现款；进出口业认捐飞机五架，已缴款五十七亿余元。各界妇女正积极缴纳购买“天津妇女号”飞机的现款。学生们的捐款据不完全统计已有六千万元，很多学生利用暑假参加社会服务或举行义演，将收入捐购飞机大炮。
    唐山市各界人民已缴纳捐献飞机大炮款项六十五亿六千余万元，超过了全市认捐战斗机十二架、高射炮一门总值的三分之一。该市的许多单位，都根据该市抗美援朝分会计划在本年第三季度完成捐献飞机六架、高射炮一门的目标，订出了本季度的具体的捐献计划，并普遍修订了爱国公约，把增产捐献作为爱国公约的重要内容之一。全市职工现已缴款二十二亿八千余万元，提前完成并已超过本季度的计划百分之四十。该市启新洋灰工厂已缴款十五亿元。
