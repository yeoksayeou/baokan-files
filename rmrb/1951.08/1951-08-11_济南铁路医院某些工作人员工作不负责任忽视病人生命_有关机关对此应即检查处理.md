    Certain Staff Members of Jinan Railway Hospital Are Irresponsible and Neglect Patients' Lives; Relevant Authorities Should Immediately Investigate and Handle This

    Certain staff members of Jinan Railway Hospital are irresponsible and seriously neglect patients' lives, resulting in the death of patient Sun Hongsi. I suggest that the relevant authorities investigate the responsibility for this matter and inspect and improve the hospital's work.

    Sun Hongsi, a People's Policeman from the Jinan Railway Bureau Public Security Department's Train Crew Detachment, felt unwell on July 1st. Between July 3rd and 7th, he went to Jinan Railway Hospital for medical treatment four times. The hospital said he had a cold and it was nothing serious. On July 8th, Sun Hongsi's condition worsened, and he was seen twice again by the hospital's clinic stationed at the Bureau. The clinic doctor said his condition was serious and he needed to be hospitalized. On the 9th, we contacted the hospital by telephone regarding hospitalization, but the hospital actually said that Sun Hongsi's condition was not serious and he could not be hospitalized. We immediately expressed our opinion, and the hospital then agreed to let Sun Hongsi be hospitalized.

    Sun Hongsi was admitted to the hospital on July 9th. On July 10th, the hospital sent us a report form for critically ill patients, stating that Sun Hongsi was suffering from severe typhoid fever. We immediately sent someone to visit him and asked the hospital: Why was it a cold yesterday, and today it has become typhoid fever? The hospital doctor said: Sun Hongsi's illness has always been typhoid fever; but because the hospital did not have beds, they said it was a cold. However, according to our comrades who sent the patient to the hospital, the hospital clearly had empty beds.

    On July 18th, the comrades from our detachment who went to see the patient returned and said: Sun Hongsi also has meningitis. On the 21st, our detachment called to inquire about Sun Hongsi's condition. The hospital said he was getting better soon. But at 3 p.m. that day, Sun Hongsi died of his illness.

    After the patient's death, we contacted the hospital. The president admitted that the hospital was not responsible enough for Sun Hongsi's illness. He said, "Sun Hongsi's illness was initially typhus, and later meningitis was added. We will definitely investigate the responsibility for this matter."

    We believe that Jinan Railway Hospital's practice of neglecting patients' lives is extremely bad. As far as we know, many employees of the Jinan Railway Bureau have opinions about the hospital. We request the leadership to investigate the responsibility for Sun Hongsi's death and conduct a severe handling; and to seriously inspect the hospital's work and correct the irresponsible and bad work style of some staff members of the hospital.

    济南铁路医院某些工作人员工作不负责任忽视病人生命
    有关机关对此应即检查处理
    济南铁路医院某些工作人员不负责任，严重忽视病人生命，致造成病人孙洪泗的死亡。我建议有关机关对此事追究责任，并检查改进该院工作。
    济南铁路局公安处乘务中队人民警察孙洪泗在七月一日感到不舒服，七月三日至七日间，他到济南铁路医院看了四次病，该院说他感冒了，没有什么关系。七月八日，孙洪泗病势加重，又由该院驻局诊疗所看了两次。诊疗所的医生说他病势严重，必须住院治疗。九日，我们用电话和院方接洽住院问题，院方竟说孙洪泗病势不重，不能住院。我们当即提出意见，院方才答应让孙洪泗住院。
    孙洪泗在七月九日进院，七月十日，院方就给我们送来重病员报告单，说孙洪泗患的是严重的伤寒病。我们当即派人去探望，并询问院方：为什么昨天还是感冒，今天就成为伤寒了？该院医生说：孙洪泗的病一直是伤寒；但因为医院没床位，才说是感冒。但据我们送病人入院的同志了解，该院明明是有空床位的。
    七月十八日，我队去看病人的同志回来说：孙洪泗又患了脑膜炎。二十一日，我队打电话询问孙洪泗的病势。院方说他病快好了。但当天下午三时，孙洪泗就病死了。
    病人死后，我们就和院方联系。院长承认院方对孙洪泗的病是不够负责的。他说：“孙洪泗的病一开始就是斑疹伤寒，后来又增加了脑膜炎。这件事我们一定追究责任。”
    我们认为：济南铁路医院这种忽视病人生命的作风是极端恶劣的。据我们所知，济南铁路局很多职工对该院都有意见。我们要求领导上对孙洪泗的死亡事件查究责任，进行严正处理；并认真检查该院工作，纠正该院某些工作人员不负责任的恶劣作风。
