　　Linking Ethnic Minorities with the Nation Economically!
    ——The Development of Material Exchange Work Increased the Production Enthusiasm of Ethnic Minorities
    Thanks to the development of state-owned trade work, the lives of ethnic minorities across the country have been preliminarily improved, and production is rapidly recovering in the past two years.
    Since the liberation of the country two years ago, according to incomplete statistics, state-owned trading companies have set up 742 institutions such as companies, retail stores, purchasing stations, consignment shops, and processing factories in ethnic minority areas across the country, as well as a large number of mobile trade teams, and absorbed about 1,700 ethnic minority trade workers. These institutions have greatly promoted the exchange of goods between ethnic groups. Taking the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which was liberated earlier, as an example, in 1950, state-owned trading companies purchased 180.6 billion yuan worth of goods in the four eastern leagues of the region, accounting for 86 percent of the total sales of agricultural, pastoral, and local products of the people in the four leagues; the supply of materials was 187.1 billion yuan, accounting for 74 percent of the purchasing power of the people in the four leagues. In the remote ethnic minority areas of the Northwest, the exchange of goods is also unprecedentedly active. From March to December last year, the Xinjiang Provincial State-owned Trading Company transported important materials from Xi'an and Lanzhou to Xinjiang, including 570,000 bolts of cloth (some of which belonged to private merchants) and 490,000 bricks of tea. In Xinjiang, it purchased 450,000 sheep casings and 3,400 tons of wool, as well as a large number of hides, wheat, and cotton, with a total value equivalent to 460,000 bolts of blue twill. Last year, the State-owned Trading Company of Xikang Province purchased 2.7 billion yuan worth of unsold goods accumulated by the Tibetan people for many years and 11.5 billion yuan worth of other local specialties from the Tibetan areas, and supplied the Tibetan people with more than 6 million catties of tea alone.
    After state-owned trading companies in ethnic minority areas carried out material exchanges in ethnic minority areas, the prices of local products and specialties were appropriately increased, thus initially improving the lives of ethnic minorities. The purchasing power of ethnic minorities has generally increased by one to three times compared with before liberation, and agricultural and animal husbandry production has gradually recovered and developed. In the Yikezhao League area of ​​Suiyuan Province, due to the reasonable adjustment of grain and local product prices by state-owned trading companies and the appropriate reduction of the scissor difference, the Mongolian people have taken off their old sheepskins and put on white cloth shirts this summer, and their lives have been significantly improved. The serious "salt shortage" among the Yi people in Xikang Province, the Miao people in Guizhou and Hunan Provinces, and the Yao people in Guangxi Province has been generally alleviated. In 1947, people in the Inner Mongolia area had to exchange one ton of grain for half a bolt of Wufu cloth, but last year they could exchange for more than two bolts; the price of wool produced in the area has increased three times in the past two years; in the four eastern leagues of the area, the purchasing power of the people in 1950 increased by more than three times compared with 1947. The entire Inner Mongolia region has undergone systematic reforms of the political and social systems, coupled with the increasing development of material exchanges, and the purchasing power of farmers and herdsmen has generally increased by three to four times, and agricultural and animal husbandry productivity has also increased rapidly. Now the people of Inner Mongolia can export 400,000 tons of surplus grain every year, and the total value of local products, specialties, and livestock products can be converted into 630,000 tons of grain. Another example is livestock products in ethnic minority areas in the Northwest. In the past, under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary government, they could not be sold outside, wool was not sheared, sheep casings were fed to dogs, and sheep production was sharply reduced. After liberation, due to the active purchase of state-owned trading companies, wool has become a best-selling product in short supply, and the production enthusiasm of ethnic minority farmers and herdsmen has been greatly improved. Therefore, last year's livestock production increased by 50% compared with 1948, the period of Kuomintang rule. Due to the brisk sales of wool in ethnic minority areas such as Qinghai and Xikang provinces, this year's wool production has increased more than in previous years.
    In the past two years, the work of state-owned trading companies in carrying out material exchanges in ethnic minority areas has been universally and warmly welcomed by ethnic minorities. There are more than 40 million ethnic minorities in our country, scattered in Northwest, Southwest, Inner Mongolia, Central South, and North China. Most of them live by nomadism, and a few engage in agricultural production. Due to the discrimination, enslavement, and extortion by feudal reactionary rule and the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past, the economy has been in a state of stagnation and decline for a long time. Ethnic minorities cannot be self-sufficient in terms of living and production. Their common requirement is to sell local products and specialties to the Han areas and purchase necessary supplies at the same time. Therefore, developing commerce and linking ethnic minority areas with the country economically has become an important key to helping ethnic minorities get rid of poverty and backwardness economically, thereby promoting the development of the national economy. However, except for the Tibetan, Hui, Uyghur, and Mongolian ethnic groups, very few other ethnic groups engage in commerce. In the past two years, state-owned trading companies have implemented the policy of ethnic unity in the Common Program and vigorously carried out material exchanges in ethnic minority areas. The economic isolation and closedness of ethnic minorities have been greatly changed. They sincerely thank the People's Government and Chairman Mao. When some ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province saw the salt supplied by the trading company at a low price, they happily said: "I see you, and I eat you, and I will live forever with you!" When the Tibetan people in Qinghai Province went to the trading company to buy things, they all wanted to take a picture of Chairman Mao home. A Tibetan named Xianbalongbu in Qinghai Province wrote a song saying: "Drinking cow blood, eating wild grass, no grain to eat for more than 30 years. Today, bags and bags of highland barley are loaded; the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army are serious about everything. After liberation, we are the masters of our own house." Once, Dulan County in Qinghai Province was disturbed by bandits, and the local Tibetan people automatically guarded the state-owned trading company for more than 20 consecutive days. Once, the Dulan State-owned Trading Company went to the countryside to sell goods, and more than 40 Tibetan people automatically led horses and carried guns to protect the company's materials.

　　从经济上把少数民族和全国联结起来！
    ——物资交流工作的开展提高了少数民族的生产热情
    全国各地少数民族，两年来由于国营贸易工作的开展，生活已经初步改善，生产也在迅速恢复中。
    全国解放两年以来，根据不完全统计，国营贸易公司已在全国各少数民族地区设置了公司、门市部、采购站、代销店、加工厂等机构七百四十二处和大批流动贸易小组，吸收了少数民族的贸易工作干部约一千七百多人。这些机构大大地促进了各民族间的物资交流。以解放较早的内蒙古自治区为例、国营贸易公司一九五○年在该区东部四个盟购货价值一千八百零六亿元，占四个盟人民农、牧、土产品出售总额的百分之八十六；供应物资一千八百七十一亿元，占四个盟人民购买力的百分之七十四。辽远偏僻的西北少数民族区，物资交流也空前活跃。新疆省国营贸易公司从去年三月到十二月间，由西安、兰州运去新疆的重要物资计有布匹五十七万匹（内有部分属于私商）、茶四十九万块，在新疆收购羊肠四十五万根、羊毛三千四百吨，还有大量兽皮、小麦、棉花，总值折合青斜纹布四十六万匹。西康省国营贸易公司去年曾收购藏族人民积存多年的滞销货价值二十七亿元和藏民区其他土特产一百十五亿元，供应藏族人民的物资仅茶叶一项就达六百万市斤以上。
    少数民族地区的国营贸易公司开展少数民族地区物资交流以后，土产、特产价格适当提高，因而初步改善了各少数民族的生活。各少数民族购买力一般都已比解放前提高一倍到三倍左右，农、牧业生产也已逐渐恢复、发展起来。在绥远省伊克昭盟一带，由于粮食和土产价格已经国营贸易公司合理调整，剪刀差价适当缩小，蒙族人民今年夏天都已脱下老羊皮，穿上白布衫，生活显著改善。西康省的彝族，贵州、湖南省的苗族，广西省的瑶族，历年来严重的“盐荒”都在普遍减轻中。一九四七年，内蒙区人民须以一吨粮食才能换到半匹五福布，去年可换到两匹多；该区所产羊毛的价格，两年来提高了三倍；该区东部四个盟，一九五○年人民购买力比一九四七年增加了三倍以上。内蒙全区已经过政治和社会制度的系统改革，加以物资交流日益开展，农民、牧民购买力一般都已提高三倍到四倍，农、牧业生产力也因而迅速提高。现在内蒙人民每年已可输出余粮四十万吨，输出土产、特产和畜产总值可折粮六十三万吨。又如西北少数民族地区畜产品，过去在国民党反动政府压榨下不能外销，羊毛不剪，羊肠喂狗，羊产锐减。解放后由于国营贸易公司积极收购，羊毛已成了供不应求的畅销货，少数民族的农、牧民生产热情大大提高，因此去年畜产量比国民党统治时期的一九四八年增加了百分之五十。青海、西康等省少数民族地区由于羊毛畅销，今年羊毛产量比以前各年都增加很多。
    国营贸易公司两年来开展少数民族地区物资交流的工作，受到各少数民族普遍而热烈的欢迎。我国少数民族共有四千多万人，散居在西北、西南、内蒙、中南、华北各地。他们多以游牧为生，也有少数从事农业生产。由于历来受到封建反动统治和国民党反动政府的歧视、奴役和巧取豪夺，经济上长期处于停滞和衰退状态。各少数民族在生活和生产方面不能自给自足，他们的共同要求是向汉族区推销土产、特产，同时购入必需用品。因而，发展商业，从经济上把少数民族地区和全国联结起来，就成为帮助各少数民族从经济上摆脱贫困与落后，从而促进全国经济的发展的一个重要关键。但是，除了藏、回、维吾尔、蒙等民族以外，其他各民族经营商业的极少。国营贸易公司两年来执行了共同纲领中的民族团结政策，大力开展了少数民族地区的物资交流，各少数民族经济上孤独、闭塞的情况大为改观。他们由衷地感激人民政府和毛主席。云南省各少数民族中有人见了贸易公司廉价供应的盐时，高兴地说：“我看见你啦，也吃着你啦，我有了你就长生不老啦！”青海省藏族人民到贸易公司买东西时，都想要带一张毛主席的照片回家去。青海省藏民显巴隆布写了一首歌子道：“喝牛血，吃野草，三十多年没粮吃。今天一袋一袋的装青稞；人民政府、解放军，样样都认真。解放了，我们当家作主人。”青海省都兰县有一次遭土匪扰乱，当地藏族人民就自动给国营贸易公司连续警卫了二十多天。都兰国营贸易公司有一次下乡销货，藏民四十多人就自动牵着马带着枪来保护公司的物资。
