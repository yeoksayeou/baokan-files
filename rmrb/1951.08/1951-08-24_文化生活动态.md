　　“The Couple's March” is a bad film that distorts the reality of the new China.
    The film "The Couple's March," recently shown in Beijing, is a bad film that seriously distorts the reality of the new China. It obliterates the leading role of the working class and the Communist Party in the revolution and exaggerates the role of the petty bourgeoisie. It viciously distorts the image of the military representative and the trade union cadres, portraying the military representative as lacking any leadership ability and as an inexplicably ignorant "bumpkin"; the trade union chairman is depicted as idle and a frivolous petty rogue. The comprador ideology and life of the protagonist and his wife are not only not severely criticized by the author, but they are also sympathetically depicted as living in increasingly straitened circumstances after liberation, even the heroine's joint speculation and profiteering with bad friends is portrayed as being forced by life. The film also contains many slanders of the Chinese Communist Party by the comprador bourgeoisie before and after the liberation of Shanghai, and the filmmakers did not forcefully criticize these slanders in the film.
    When this film was shown in Shanghai and Tianjin, Wenhui Daily and Progressive Daily published critical articles that sternly pointed out the film's ideological errors, and such criticism was absolutely necessary.
  Northeast Model Teachers and Beijing Teachers Hold Symposium to Exchange Teaching Experience
    The Northeast Model Teachers Touring Group to Beijing, organized by the Northeast Department of Education, arrived in Beijing in early August. In order to exchange teaching experience, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education invited them to a symposium with some outstanding teachers in Beijing on the afternoon of August 17.
    Ren Su, a Chinese language teacher at Tailai Middle School in Heilongjiang Province, introduced his experience in conducting patriotic education in Chinese language teaching at the symposium. He said, "If you want to conduct patriotic education well, teachers must fully prepare their lessons, read more relevant books to enrich the material, and understand the ideological situation of each student in detail." In order to fully understand his students, Ren Su conducted in-depth home visits to a class he was in charge of, so he was very familiar with each of his students.
    Yan Xijie, a physics teacher at Harbin No. 6 Middle School, offered two suggestions on how to conduct patriotic education through physics classes: (1) In class, systematically introduce the achievements of the motherland's national defense construction and production construction, as well as the great creations of the working people in Chinese history, in conjunction with the teaching materials. And we must inspire students' imagination and aesthetic sentiment in science and guide them to make models; in this way, they will understand the meaning of labor and increase their affection for the great creation of the working people. (2) According to the content of the text, organize students to practice, visit and travel, and conduct local surveys, so that students love every plant and tree in the motherland, which is the starting point for cultivating students' patriotism.
    Geng Keren, a physics teacher at Beijing Hebei High School, believes that in order to make patriotic education in schools a success, teachers should strengthen their own political study; only by raising their own political awareness can they improve students' patriotic education.
    Wen Guoxin, a Chinese language teacher at Beijing Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School, emphasized that "Implementing patriotic education is one of the important tasks of teaching in all subjects. Classroom and extracurricular activities should be closely integrated; teaching in all subjects should also cooperate with each other, and attention should be paid to the environmental arrangement of patriotic education."
    Organizing excellent teachers to hold symposiums and exchange teaching experience is one of the important methods to improve school education and is worth promoting. (Wang Ming)
  Qinghai Brotherly Nationalities People Love Tibetan Newspaper
    Since its inception on January 16, the Qinghai Tibetan newspaper has correctly publicized the Common Program to the Mongolian and Tibetan people, conducted education on resisting the US and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, guided local work, reflected the new life of the Mongolian and Tibetan people, and encouraged the Mongolian and Tibetan people to work hard to build a new Qinghai. In the past, the reactionary rulers consistently destroyed and restricted the development of cultural undertakings of fraternal nationalities and deprived the working people of fraternal nationalities of the right to use their own writing to express their opinions. In the past, the Mongolian and Tibetan people had not only never seen newspapers in their own languages, but even learning their own languages was prohibited by Ma Bufang. The creation of the Tibetan newspaper is a pioneering undertaking in the history of Qinghai Province and a concrete manifestation of the People's Government's implementation of the Common Program and development of national culture. Therefore, it has won the warm support of the Mongolian and Tibetan people. Many Tibetans in Gonghe, Xinghai, Haiyan and other counties enthusiastically ran to the county people's governments to ask for newspapers to read after hearing the news of the publication of the Tibetan newspaper, saying, "This is our own newspaper!" The Nationalities Public School uses the Tibetan newspaper as teaching material for Tibetan students.
    However, since the newspaper was founded not long ago, it still can't deeply understand the ideological requirements and customs of the Mongolian and Tibetan people, and the writing and content are not easy enough to understand, so it can't fully meet the requirements of the Mongolian and Tibetan people. To run a good newspaper for brotherly nationalities, it is necessary to deeply understand the thoughts, feelings, and requirements of brotherly nationalities, cultivate news cadres from brotherly nationalities, and the newspaper's writing must be easy to understand in order to meet the requirements of the people of brotherly nationalities.

　　《夫妇进行曲》是一部歪曲描写新中国现实的坏影片
    最近在北京上演的影片《夫妇进行曲》，是一部对新中国的现实作了严重歪曲的坏影片。它抹煞了工人阶级及共产党在革命中的领导作用，将小资产阶级在革命中的作用加以夸大描写。恶劣地歪曲了军代表和工会干部的形象，将军代表描写为毫无领导能力，是个莫明其妙的“土包子”；工会主席被描写成无所事事，举动轻浮的小流氓。该片中的主人公及其妻子的买办思想和生活，不但未被作者加以严厉的批判，反而同情地描写他们在解放后生活日形拮据，甚至女主角和坏朋友的合股投机倒把，也是为生活所迫。影片中还有一些买办资产阶级在上海解放前后对中国共产党的许多诽谤，影片作者并未在影片中对这些诽谤进行有力的批判。
    此片在上海、天津上演时，文汇报及进步日报上已发表批评文章，严正指出该片的错误思想，这种批评是完全必要的。
  东北模范教师与北京教师举行座谈交换教学经验
    东北教育部组织的东北模范教师赴京旅行团已于八月初抵京。为了交流教学工作经验，北京市文教局曾于八月十七日下午邀请他们与北京市部分优秀教师举行座谈。
    黑龙江省泰来中学语文教师任愫同志在座谈会上介绍了他在语文教学中进行爱国主义教育的经验。他说：“要想把爱国主义教育进行得好，教师必须充分地准备课程，多多阅读有关书籍以充实材料，及详细了解每个学生的思想情况。”任愫同志为了全面了解学生，曾对他所担任级任的一个班，做了深入的家庭访问工作，因而能够非常熟悉他的每一个学生。
    哈尔滨市第六中学物理教师阎喜杰同志对于如何通过物理课进行爱国主义教育的问题，提出两点意见：（一）在课内，要结合教材有系统地介绍祖国国防建设、生产建设的成就和中国历史上劳动人民的伟大创造。并且要启发学生在科学方面的想像力和审美情操，诱导他们去制造模型；这样，使他们了解劳动的意义从而增加他们对劳动人民的伟大创造的感情。（二）根据课文的内容，组织学生实习、参观和旅行，作乡土调查，使学生热爱祖国的一草一木，是培养学生爱国主义的起点。
    北京河北高中物理教师耿克仁同志认为：要使学校中的爱国主义教育进行得好，教员应加强自己的政治学习；只有把自己的政治觉悟提高一步，才能提高学生的爱国主义教育。
    北京市立第一女中语文教师闻国新同志强调提出：“贯彻爱国主义教育是各科教学的重要任务之一。课内、课外应紧密结合；各科教学也要互相配合，并应注意爱国主义教育的环境布置。”
    组织优秀教师举行座谈，交流教学经验，是提高学校教育工作的重要方法之一，值得提倡。（王明）
  青海兄弟民族人民热爱藏文报
    青海省藏文报自一月十六日创刊以来，曾向蒙、藏人民正确地宣传了共同纲领，进行了抗美援朝、镇压反革命教育，指导了当地的工作，并反映了蒙、藏人民的新生活，鼓舞蒙、藏人民努力建设新青海。过去历史上的反动统治者，一贯地摧残和限制兄弟民族文化事业的发展，剥夺了兄弟民族劳动人民运用自己的文字，发表自己意见的权利。过去蒙、藏人民不但没有见过自己文字的报纸，就连学习自己的文字也要受到马匪步芳的禁止。藏文报的创刊，是青海省历史上的创举，也是人民政府贯彻共同纲领、发展民族文化的具体表现，因此获得蒙、藏人民的热烈拥护。共和、兴海、海晏等县的许多藏民，听到藏文报出版的消息以后，很热情地跑到县人民政府要报纸看，说：“这是我们自己的报纸！”民族公学把藏文报作为藏族学生的教材。
    但由于报纸创刊不久，对蒙、藏人民的思想要求和风俗习惯，还不能深刻的体会，文字及内容还不够通俗易懂，因此还不能完全满足蒙、藏人民的要求。要办好兄弟民族的报纸，必须深刻体会兄弟民族的思想情感和要求，培养兄弟民族的新闻干部，报纸文字要通俗易懂，以满足兄弟民族人民的要求。
