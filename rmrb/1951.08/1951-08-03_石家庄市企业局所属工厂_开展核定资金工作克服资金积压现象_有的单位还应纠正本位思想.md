The factories under the Shijiazhuang Municipal Enterprise Bureau have successively launched capital verification calculation work since June 15 this year. According to the capital quota plan stipulated by the higher authorities, and in accordance with the principles decided within the bureau, draft tables were formulated separately to verify the required capital amounts for each item.

Judging from the initial results of this capital verification, the waste in capital utilization in the factories under the bureau in the past was very serious. After the capital verification, the capital occupied by each factory was more than half less than the original capital amount occupied at the end of May. At the same time, in the process of asset liquidation, it was found that the total value of unused materials and defective products accumulated in the factories reached more than 300 million yuan. This phenomenon shows that asset liquidation and capital verification have a great role in promoting the acceleration of capital turnover and the rational use of capital.

At the same time, it was found in the investigation that the factories generally have the mistaken view of underestimating materials. The warehouse system in most factories is not strict. Sometimes, emphasizing that it does not affect production, materials can be received without material requisition slips, and there are no material return slips for returned materials. Sometimes good materials are taken out and replaced with bad ones. Some factories also have no records of production tools. In order to solve the above problems, in addition to strictly implementing the procedures for receiving, issuing, and returning materials, the responsible personnel must also establish a sense of responsibility and give material management the same importance as cash management.

In addition, it was found in the capital verification work that the accumulation of finished products due to unqualified quality is also the biggest waste of capital. For example, the flour produced by the flour mill is dusty and cannot be sold; the bone glue produced by the chemical plant is of poor quality and some is also in stock. The capital occupied is the capital needed for production. This makes capital seriously difficult. After the capital is verified, it will inspire employees to improve product quality and prevent the generation of defective products.

From the above facts, it can be seen that the factories under the Shijiazhuang Municipal Enterprise Bureau have made many achievements in the capital verification work. However, because some factories do not fully understand the significance of this work, and at the same time, there are more or less some localist ideas, two deviations have occurred in the capital verification work: one is to overestimate capital, only fearing that it is not enough for turnover. For example, the raw materials required by the ice-making plant were set at a large inventory number even during the shutdown period. The monthly sales volume of bone glue produced by the chemical plant is less than one-half of the production volume, which increases the accumulation of finished products. The other is to occupy as little capital as possible for fear of not being able to pay dividends. For example, the weaving factory only made a three-day inventory of flour bag cloth, planning to let the flour mill pay at any time. Some factories are afraid of trouble and do not carefully determine and calculate capital according to actual needs, and the monthly inventory of various items forms a uniform pattern. The Municipal Enterprise Bureau immediately conducted explanations and education according to the above situation, but these problems have not been completely resolved.

In this capital verification work, it was found that the annual plans of some factories are no longer practical: for example, the annual plans of the chemical plant and oil plant are lower than the actual production, but in this capital verification, the chemical plant verified according to the original plan. This is wrong. To achieve rational capital verification, it is necessary to revise and formulate a rational and practical production plan in advance, otherwise, the verified capital will not meet the needs of production.

　　石家庄市企业局所属工厂
    开展核定资金工作克服资金积压现象
    有的单位还应纠正本位思想
    石家庄市人民政府企业局所属各工厂，自今年六月十五日起，先后展开核定资金的计算工作。根据上级规定的资金定额计划表，并按照局内决定原则，分别制定草表，核定各项所需资金数。
    从这次初步核定资金的结果来看，该局所属各厂过去在资金运用上存在着的浪费现象是非常严重的。在核定资金以后，各工厂所占资金较五月底原占资金额少了一半以上；同时在清理资产中，发现各厂积压不用的物资和残废品总值即达三亿余元。这种现象说明了清理资产、核定资金对加速资金周转，合理运用资金有着很大的推动作用。
    同时，在清查中发现各厂普遍存在着轻视物资的错误观点。大部分厂的仓库制度不严格。有时强调不影响生产，没有领料单的也能领料，退料的没有退料单。有的拿出去的是好料，换回来的都是坏的。部分工厂对生产工具也没有记载。为解决以上问题，除严格执行领发、退料手续外，主管人员还必须树立责任心，要把物资管理和现金管理提到同等重要的地位。
    另外，在核定资金工作中发现质量不合格，而使成品积压，也是资金的最大浪费。如面粉厂出的沙尘面粉无法推销；化学厂生产的骨胶质量不高，也积存了一些。所占用的资金是生产需要的资金。这样就使资金发生严重困难。核定资金后，就会启发职工提高产品的质量，并防止废品的产生。
    从以上事实，可以看出石家庄市企业局所属各厂在核定资金工作中有不少成绩。但由于有的工厂对这一工作的意义领会不足，同时，还或多或少地存在着一些本位主义思想，所以在核定资金工作中就发生了两种偏差：一种是宽打资金，光怕不够周转。如制冰厂所需的原料，在停工期间也定了很大的库存数目。化学厂生产的骨胶，每月销售量还不及生产量的二分之一。增大了成品的积压量，另一种是怕多占资金交不起股息，便尽可能地少占资金。如织布厂面袋布只打了三天的库存量，打算让面粉厂随时付款。有的工厂害怕麻烦，不认真根据实际需要来确定和核算资金，每月各项库存量形成一律。该市企业局即按照以上情况，随时进行解释和教育，但这些问题还没有获得彻底解决。
    在这次核定资金工作中，发现有的工厂的年计划已不切合实际：如化学厂、油厂的年计划低于现实生产，但在此次核定资金时，化学厂却按原计划核定。这是不对的。要作到合理地核定资金，必须在事先修改与制定合理的切合实际的生产计划，否则，所核定的资金将不符合生产需要。
