Editor's Note: The measures taken by the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Southwest Military and Political Committee to rectify the chaotic phenomena in school work are correct and necessary. These measures have already achieved significant results and are worthy of emulation by other regions. Because chaotic phenomena in school work exist not only in new areas but also in old areas; the phenomenon of reduced numbers of high school and higher education students is a nationwide problem. It is hoped that all regions will pay attention to checking and eliminating this chaotic phenomenon.

Since liberation, school education work in the Southwest has basically implemented the central government's policy of "maintaining existing schools and gradually making possible and necessary improvements," and has achieved significant results. In a situation of extreme shortage of cadres, it was originally necessary to absorb a large number of intellectuals to participate in work, but due to the lack of necessary control, chaotic and spontaneous phenomena occurred in universities, middle schools, and primary schools in various places. The Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has repeatedly instructed to strengthen school work and strictly prohibit the random recruitment and transfer of students in school; however, various places still did not pay enough attention, and some even failed to manage school work at all, and the deviations in work could not be overcome quickly. As a result of random recruitment and transfer, the number of students in public and private universities and colleges in the Southwest in the first half of this year decreased by 23 percent compared with the previous semester. It is estimated that universities and colleges in the Southwest will enroll 11,000 new students this year, but the number of high school graduates who can take the exam is only 6,000. The number of junior high school students in the entire region has increased significantly, and the number of primary school students has generally doubled, while the number of senior high school students and university and college students has decreased significantly, forming a serious disconnection. This must be overcome immediately.

Secondly, the chaotic phenomena in schools are also manifested in participation in social activities. School education lacks sound management, and various organs and organizations often transfer teachers and students in school to participate in temporary work, which seriously hinders students' studies and normal teaching work. At the same time, in primary and secondary school education work, some areas have also produced deviations that violate the Party's policy towards intellectuals.

In order to rectify the chaotic phenomena in school work, the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Southwest Military and Political Committee simultaneously issued instructions, stipulating:

(1) All educational and administrative work in the school shall be under the unified leadership of the school administrative authorities; all social activities shall be under the unified leadership of the school education union and the student union, and shall obtain the support and assistance of the school administrative authorities. All work in the school should take the completion of the school education plan as the basic task.

(2) No agency or organization shall arbitrarily transfer students in school. Those who must be transferred from school due to the urgent needs of national construction work, individual transfers of university, college and secondary school students must be approved by the Southwest Cultural and Education Department, and individual transfers of senior junior high school and high school students must be approved by the provincial Cultural and Education Department. As for batch transfers, they must all be approved by the Cultural and Education Department.

(3) Immediately stop the chaotic phenomenon in which various organs and people's organizations outside the school arbitrarily arrange work in the school alone and arbitrarily mobilize students to participate in extracurricular activities, resulting in multi-headed leadership and hindering educational work. Except for national statutory holidays, schools at all levels shall not suspend classes freely.

After the instructions were issued, the Southwest Bureau immediately convened a symposium of higher education workers in Chongqing to study how to continue to improve school education work, and also discussed the unity of education workers and social work. At the meeting, the importance of internal unity in the education sector was once again emphasized, stating that schools must be run well on the basis of "unified understanding, unified policy, and unified tasks"; democratic discussions must be carried out within the education sector to eliminate estrangement and respect each other, and self-criticism must also be carried out under such principles. In principle, each activist should only undertake one social work, and at most should not exceed two or three. Comprehensive work in the school can be discussed and resolved by convening a joint meeting of the administration, education union, student union, and youth league to unify the leadership in the school.

In order to solve the above problems, the Southwest Region is preparing to hold an education work conference in mid-August.

Simultaneous with the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Southwest Military and Political Committee taking this correct measure, the Chongqing Xinhua Daily published a series of reports and commentaries targeting the chaotic phenomena in school education. The local education community and students unanimously expressed satisfaction with the criticisms of the Xinhua Daily. After seeing the report, the students read it word by word, and sincerely felt the care and love of the Party and the people's government for young students. Students from Chongqing University said: "We should study hard in the future and not let down the concern of the Party and the people's government for us."

### 中共中央西南局  大力纠正学校工作中的混乱现象

　　中共中央西南局
    大力纠正学校工作中的混乱现象
    编者按：中共中央西南局和西南军政委员会，为了纠正学校工作中的混乱现象所采取的措施是正确的、必要的。这种措施已经有了显著成效，值得各地效法。因为学校工作中的混乱现象，不但新区有，老区也有；高中以上学校学生减少的现象，是一个全国性的问题。望各地都注意检查和消灭这种混乱现象。
    解放以来，西南的学校教育工作，基本上执行了中央“维持原有学校、逐步作可能与必要的改善”的方针，并获得了显著的成绩。在干部异常缺乏的情况下，吸收大批知识分子参加工作原是必要的，但由于缺少必要的控制，以至各地大学、中学到小学普遍地发生混乱与自流现象。中共中央西南局曾历次指示加强学校工作，严禁乱招、乱调在校学生；但各地仍注意不够，甚至仍无人管理学校工作，工作中的偏向亦不能迅速克服。由于乱招、乱调的结果，今年上半年西南各公、私立高等学校学生人数竟较上学期减少百分之二十三。预计今年西南高等学校招收新生为一万一千人，而能应考的高中毕业生不过六千人。全区初中学生有显著增加，小学生一般增加一倍左右，而高中生与大学、专科学校学生则大量减少，形成了严重的脱节现象。这是必须立即克服的。
    其次，学校中的混乱现象也表现在参加社会活动方面。学校教育既缺乏健全的管理，而各机关、团体又常常调动在校师生参加临时工作，以致学生的课业和正常的教学工作受到严重的妨碍。同时，在中、小学教育工作中，不少地区还产生了违反党对知识分子的政策的偏向。
    为了纠正学校工作中的混乱现象，中共中央西南局和西南军政委员会同时发布了指示，规定：
    （一）学校内一切教育工作和行政工作，均由学校行政当局统一领导；一切社会活动则由该校教育工会与学生会统一领导，并取得学校行政当局的支持与协助。学校中的一切工作均应以完成学校教育计划为基本任务。
    （二）对在校学生任何机关团体不得任意调动。其因国家建设工作之迫切需要必须调离学校者，大、专中学生之个别调动，须经西南文教部核准，初中高年级、高中学生之个别调动，须经省文教厅核准。至于成批的调动一律须经文教部核准。
    （三）立即停止校外各机关、各人民团体擅自在校内单独布置工作，随便动员学生参加校外活动，以致形成多头领导，妨碍教育工作的混乱现象。除国家规定的假日外，各级学校均不得自由停课。
    在指示发出后，西南局又紧接着召开了重庆市高等教育工作者的座谈会，研究如何继续改进学校教育工作，并且讨论了教育工作者的团结和社会工作等问题。会上，再次强调了教育界内部团结的重要，说明必须在“统一的认识、统一的方针、统一的任务”的基础上真正团结起来办好学校；必须在教育界内部展开民主讨论、化除隔阂、互相尊重，自我批评也必须在这样的原则下进行。积极分子原则上每个人只担负一件社会工作，最多也不应超过两、三件。关于学校中带全面性的工作可召集行政、教育工会、学生会、青年团的共同会议来讨论解决，以统一学校中的领导。
    为了解决上述诸问题，西南区准备在八月中召开教育工作会议。
    和中共中央西南局和西南军政委员会采取这一正确的措施同时，重庆新华日报针对学校教育中的混乱现象，连续发表了一系列的报道和评论。当地教育界和学生对于新华日报的批评一致表示满意。学生见报后一字一句地诵读着，衷心感到党和人民政府对青年学生的关怀与爱护。重庆大学同学说：“今后应努力学习，不要辜负党和人民政府对我们的关心。”
