The reporter and propagandist organizations in Northeast China have seen new developments in the second quarter of this year, growing by approximately one-third compared to the first quarter. According to statistics from the end of June, the region has reached 11,926 reporters and 258,900 propagandists, totaling 270,826 individuals. Among them, Party members and Communist Youth League members account for over two-thirds. The main progress in the second quarter was: (1) Reporting activities were relatively widespread. For example, the 829 reporters in Lushun-Dalian gave 4,654 reports, reaching an audience of 1,355,668 people. In Heilongjiang Province, over 1,900 reporters gave 8,122 reports in April alone, reaching nearly 3 million listeners. Comrade Zhao Dezun, the Provincial Party Secretary, directly gave four reports to workers and peasants in April, which had a very good impact. This shows that leading organs at all levels have begun to attach importance to conducting propaganda among the people. (2) In the widespread and in-depth propaganda campaigns for resisting America and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the work of propagandists has been further integrated with other forms of mass propaganda organizations. Reading groups, radio listening groups, exhibitions, slideshows, propaganda posters, blackboard newspapers, amateur theater troupes, etc., have all been widely utilized. For example, Lushun-Dalian has 5,115 reading groups led by propagandists, uniting over 100,000 people, and they read newspapers more than 16,000 times in June. Slideshows also have a good propaganda effect in rural areas. This proves that the work of propagandists has a greater impact when combined with propaganda forms that the masses love to see and hear. (3) Some regions have adopted a "contract responsibility system" for propaganda, where each reporter and propagandist is relatively fixedly responsible for conducting propaganda to a certain scope (region, unit, or industry) of propaganda targets, stipulating propaganda time and frequency. Propagandists with special skills are also responsible for doing a good job in one form of propaganda. This responsibility system in propaganda work is one of the important steps to make mass propaganda work regular and known to every household. This can also make the connection between reporters, propagandists, and the masses more fixed and closer. This method is currently being promoted in various regions.

The development of the propaganda network in the Northeast region is already quite large in quantity, but the main weakness is still that some Party organizations have failed to earnestly establish a regular leadership and management system, which has caused some propagandist and reporter organizations to become mere formalities, or their work to become erratic. The phenomena of empty, general, and unsuitable propaganda content that does not suit the masses' tastes, and the lack of ideological and political content still exist seriously, resulting in very low propaganda quality and even erroneous propaganda. Therefore, the central key to consolidating and further improving the work of reporters and propagandists in the future is how to make the Party's leading organs at all levels have a very close connection with this vast network of reporters and propagandists, master this basic propaganda force, so that it can fight in a unified and flexible manner, and regularly and systematically publicize and implement the Party's central tasks and policies among the masses. Northeast China is prepared to start improving this work in the following three aspects: (1) Earnestly establish a crucial regular leadership and management system. Party committees in industrial and mining enterprises and municipal Party committees in large and medium-sized cities should fully utilize the characteristics of concentration in cities, mainly focus on the work of reporters, so that they regularly give reports to the masses, and regularly transmit reports to propagandists through reporters. Rural county and district Party committees should mainly do a good job in the work of transmission stations, regularly convene meetings of branch secretaries and representatives of propagandists, promptly arrange propaganda content, and organize propaganda forces.基层支部则定期开好宣传员会议，主要领导宣传员学习宣传内容与检查宣传效果。 The grassroots branches should regularly hold propagandist meetings, mainly leading propagandists to study propaganda content and check propaganda effects. Party committees above the provincial level should focus on stipulating propaganda content, issuing propaganda outlines and popular propaganda materials, regularly conducting spot checks, correcting shortcomings, etc. In this way, connecting the top and bottom will gradually form a relatively complete set of leadership and management systems. (2) Make the activities of the propaganda network better serve the Party's central political and economic tasks. Since June, the propaganda network has mainly conducted propaganda on patriotic conventions, donating airplanes and cannons, and preferential treatment work, but not enough attention has been paid to propaganda on the increase in production and economy of 5 million tons of grain and quality inspection in industrial and mining enterprises. Although some enterprises have conducted some propaganda, it is still not powerful enough. It is planned that the Propaganda Department will hold a symposium on propaganda work in industrial and mining enterprises in early August to check the current propaganda situation in industry and mining, combine the current inspection of production quality with the propaganda of the three major calls of the Resist America and Aid Korea General Association, and widely organize propaganda forces to introduce and promote existing better experiences and correct the shortcomings of neglecting political and ideological work. (3) Pay attention to improving propaganda content and propaganda methods at any time. Recently, it is planned to start more systematically summarizing some specific experiences and promote them.

### 东北宣传员、报告员组织又有新发展

　　东北宣传员、报告员组织又有新发展
    东北各地的报告员和宣传员组织在今年第二季度比第一季度约发展了三分之一。据六月底统计，全区报告员已达一万一千九百二十六人，宣传员二十五万八千九百人，共合二十七万零八百二十六人。其中党员、团员约占三分之二以上。第二季度工作的主要进展是：（一）报告员的活动比较开展。如旅大报告员八百二十九人，做了四千六百五十四次报告，听众达一百三十五万五千六百六十八人。黑龙江全省报告员一千九百多人，四月份就报告了八千一百二十二次，听众将近三百万人。该省省委书记赵德尊同志四月份曾直接向工农群众做了四次报告，影响很好。这说明各级领导机关已开始重视向人民群众进行宣传。（二）在普及深入抗美援朝及镇压反革命的宣传运动中，宣传员的工作和其他各种群众宣传组织形式有了进一步的结合。读报组、收音组、展览会、幻灯、宣传画、黑板报、业余剧团等等，都已被广泛地利用起来。如旅大以宣传员为骨干的读报组有五一一五个，团结了十万多人，六月份读报一万六千多次。幻灯在农村里的宣传效果也很好。这证明宣传员工作与群众喜闻乐见的宣传形式结合起来，作用就更大。（三）有些地区采取了“包干制”的宣传方法，即每个报告员、宣传员比较固定地负责向一定范围（地区、单位或行业）的宣传对象进行宣传，规定宣传时间与次数，有特长的宣传员并负责搞好一种宣传形式。这种宣传工作中的责任制，是使群众宣传工作经常化和做到家喻户晓的重要步骤之一。这样并可使报告员、宣传员和群众的联系比较固定与更加密切。此种方法，目前各地正加以推行。
    东北全区宣传网发展数量已相当大，主要弱点仍然是有些党的组织未能认真建立经常的领导管理制度，因而使一部分宣传员、报告员组织流于形式，或使他们的工作产生忽冷忽热的现象；宣传内容空洞、一般、不适合群众口味，与缺乏思想性、政治性的现象仍然严重存在，因而宣传质量很低，甚至有错误的宣传。因此，今后巩固与进一步提高报告员、宣传员工作的中心关键，是如何使党的各级领导机关与这广大的报告员、宣传员网发生非常密切的联系，掌握这支基本宣传队伍，使它能够统一、灵活地作战，把党的中心任务与政策，经常而系统地宣传贯彻到群众中去。东北已准备从以下三方面着手改进这一工作：（一）认真地建立具有关键性的经常领导管理制度。工矿企业党委及大中城市市委，应充分利用城市中集中的特点，主要抓紧报告员工作，使之定期向群众作报告，并通过报告员经常向宣传员作传授报告。农村县区党委应主要搞好传授站工作，定期召开支部书记会议与宣传员代表会，及时布置宣传内容，组织宣传力量。基层支部则定期开好宣传员会议，主要领导宣传员学习宣传内容与检查宣传效果。省委以上着重规定宣传内容，颁发宣传要点及通俗宣传品，经常进行抽查，纠正缺点等。如此，上下衔接，逐渐形成比较完整的一套领导管理制度。（二）使宣传网的活动更好地为党的中心政治任务与经济任务服务。六月以来，宣传网主要进行关于爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和优抚工作的宣传，但对工矿企业增产节约五百万吨粮食以及质量检查的宣传则注意的很不够，有些企业虽进行一些宣传，也还不够有力。拟于八月初由宣传部召开一次工矿企业宣传工作座谈会，检查目前工矿宣传状况，把目前生产质量的检查与抗美援朝总会三大号召的宣传结合起来，并广泛地组织宣传力量，介绍推广已有的较好经验，纠正忽视政治思想工作的缺点。（三）随时注意改进宣传内容与宣传方法，最近拟开始比较有系统地总结一些具体经验，加以推广。
