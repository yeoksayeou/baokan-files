　　Guarantee That Every Railway Leads to the Front
　　Dai Yumian, Han Qichang
　　On the long railway lines of Korea, the Chinese volunteer railway workers, with unparalleled heroism, overcame enemy air raids, overcame various difficulties, repaired the damaged railways, ensured the smooth flow of transportation lines, and continuously delivered materials to the front, powerfully supporting the war at the front.
　　The enemy used every means to try to cut off our rear railway transportation lines, constantly bombing bridges, culverts, stations, and lines along the railway with planes. However, under the heroic repair work of our Chinese volunteer railway workers, the bombed bridges and tracks were quickly repaired, allowing our trains loaded with supplies to continue to drive to the front.
　　In the spring, the rivers of northern Korea were still covered with a thick layer of ice. In order to repair a large bridge, the comrades broke the ice, jumped into the water to install the wooden cages, and quickly completed the task. Comrade Qin Sheng from a certain unit, who was over fifty years old and had suffered from cold legs for a long time, insisted on working at the site during the repair project, going to the site every night to lead the repairs. Due to his diligence in using his brain and the efforts of his comrades, the original plan for a pile of wooden piers that required 1,700 man-days was completed by only fifteen people within two days. Bridgeman Wang Chuanming created a simple bridge-building machine, which advanced the completion of the beam erection work by three days.
　　The heroes on the transportation front demonstrated an even stronger and more heroic fighting will in the struggle to protect railway transportation.
　　On March 9th, enemy planes dropped two time bombs on a bridge, one landing on the shore and the other in the water at the No. 2 pier. Obviously, if these two bombs exploded, the bridge would be damaged, affecting transportation. Therefore, a certain unit of railway workers stationed locally decided to remove them. That night, it was so dark that you couldn't even see your fingers. After the warriors moved one time bomb from the shore, they began to move the one in the water. This bomb was lying in more than three feet of water. It was not an easy task to move it on such a dark and cold night. But the warriors, regardless of danger and difficulty, were determined to complete the task. Comrade Wang Guozhang was the first to strip off his clothes and jump into the water. He groped around in the water for a long time but couldn't find the bomb. The ice water made him gasp for breath, but he still insisted on continuing to grope. Comrades asked to replace him, but he just said, "It's not cold." After taking a deep breath, he "plunged" into the water. Soon, he finally found the bomb and quickly hooked the prepared rope onto the small ring of the bomb. But when everyone pulled hard, it fell off again. Comrade Wang Guozhang dived into the water again and hooked it securely. After everyone's efforts, the time bomb was finally moved, ensuring the safety of the bridge.
　　On another occasion, enemy planes dropped two time bombs at the entrance of a cave, one landing in the middle of the rails at the entrance and the other landing above the entrance. If they were not moved, a train heading to the front that was urgently waiting to pass would be delayed; if they exploded, the entrance would collapse, which would cause even greater obstacles. Therefore, the comrades stationed locally immediately began to move them, pulling with ropes if they couldn't be moved, and carrying them by hand, completing the task with selfless spirit.
　　In April of this year, enemy planes destroyed the bridge over a certain river, disrupting railway transportation. At that time, a certain unit of our Chinese volunteer railway workers accepted the task of building a bridge on the river surface near the damaged bridge. This was a huge project. After receiving this task, the unit immediately began construction. The tide ebbed and flowed suddenly, and the ground was full of silt after the tide receded, with some places not yet thawed in the lower layers. Enemy planes often came to attack, so the work was mainly carried out at night, which increased the difficulty of the work. In the middle of the night, it was pitch black all around, and the cold wind blew on the body, making it particularly cold. In the first few days of construction, it rained continuously for days. But the comrades, carrying soil baskets and wet grass bags, worked selflessly. They had only one idea in their minds: "Repair this bridge quickly. Transport grain, ammunition, and weapons to the front and eliminate the American devils." When the tide rose, the comrades worked in the water. Sometimes, when enemy planes came, they didn't even hide. Everyone shouted: "Carrying one more basket of soil is equal to one more bayonet for the American invaders. Repair the bridge ahead of schedule and support the front to win the battle." With such labor enthusiasm and patriotism, the comrades completed this great and arduous task in fifteen days.
　　The warriors also often disregarded enemy air raids to protect and rescue important bridges. Communist Party member Miao Juncheng, during a night repair, twice braved enemy strafing to extinguish the torches on the bridge that had not been extinguished in time, depriving the enemy planes of their bombing target. Comrades Lü Chuanhai and Chen Yongxin, when enemy planes set our bridge on fire with gasoline bombs, bravely rushed forward to rescue it, despite the enemy planes still circling overhead, so that the bridge was not damaged.
　　In their work, the comrades were extremely careful with materials. When a certain unit's fourth squad was performing a bridge repair task, a sudden downpour and melting ice and snow caused the river to surge, washing away 80% of the completed wooden raft frames, wooden cages, and other materials for six or seven miles. Upon learning this, the squad immediately went to rescue them. Some didn't have time to take off their clothes and jumped into the river, bravely rescuing in the icy cold current. Some comrades were knocked down by ice floes and fell into the water; some were bruised by ice floes, with blood flowing, but they still persisted in the rescue and continued for six hours. As a result, most of the washed-away materials were rescued. This not only reduced the loss of state assets but also ensured that the repair work was not affected.
　　The comrades also actively collected materials. For example, a squad of a certain unit, while serving as bridgehead guards, under the leadership of Communist Party member Yu Jianglong, Communist Youth League member Zhang Shishan, and other comrades, collected 184 fishplate splices, 133 fishplate screws, 771 track spikes, 261 through bolts, 444 iron handles, screw washers, 13 railway ties, and 30 kilograms of iron wire in three days.
　　The Chinese volunteer railway workers on the Korean railway lines, with such a spirit of not fearing any hardship, are using their blood and sweat to protect the smooth flow of transportation lines, thereby guaranteeing the victory of the front.

　　保证条条铁路通向前方
    戴羽绵　韩启昌
    在朝鲜漫长的铁路线上，中国志愿援朝的铁路员工们，以无比的英勇，战胜了敌机的袭击，克服了各种困难，抢修被破坏的铁路，保证了运输线的畅通，使物资源源不断地送到前线，有力地支援前方的战争。
    敌人用尽一切方法企图切断我后方的铁路运输线。不停地用飞机向铁路沿线的桥梁、涵洞、车站和线路施行轰炸。但是在我志愿援朝铁路员工们的英勇抢修下，被炸毁的桥梁和轨道，很快就修复，使我们满载物资的火车不停地开向前方。
    春季的时候，朝鲜北部的江里，还结着一层厚厚的冰。同志们为了抢修一座大桥，把冰打开，跳进水里把木笼安好，使任务迅速完成。某部秦盛同志，五十多岁了，长期患着寒腿病。可是在抢修工程中，他坚持现场工作，每天晚上到现场去，领导抢修。由于他的勤于动脑筋与同志们的卖劲，原来计划要一千七百个人工的搭桩木垛工程，只用了十五个人两天以内就完成了任务。架子工王传明创造简便架桥机，使架梁工作的完成，提前了三天。
    运输战线上的英雄们在保护铁路运输的斗争中，表现了更坚强与英勇的战斗意志。
    三月九日，敌机在一座桥上投了两个定时炸弹，一个落在岸上，另一个落在二号桥墩的水里。很显然，这两个炸弹如果爆炸，桥梁就会被炸坏，而影响运输。于是，驻在当地的铁路员工某部，决定把它弄走。当天的晚上，天黑得连手指都看不见。勇士们把岸上的一个定时炸弹搬走后，再开始搬在水里的那一个。这个炸弹躺在三尺多深的水中，在这样又黑又冷的寒夜、把它弄走实在不是一件容易的事情。但勇士们不顾危险与困难，决心要完成任务。王国章同志第一个脱光了衣服，跳进水中。他在水中摸来摸去，好一会没有找着炸弹。冰水把他冻得透不过气来，但是他仍坚持着继续摸索，同志们要求替换他，他只说“不冷”。他深深吸了一口气之后，便“扑通”一声，潜入水底。不一会炸弹终于被他摸着了，他迅速地将预备好的绳子上的钩子挂在炸弹的小环上。但是大家用力一拉，却又掉了。王国章同志又再次钻入水底，把钩子稳稳挂上。经过大家的努力，终于把这个定时弹弄走了。保证了桥梁的安全。
    又一次，敌机在一个山洞口投了两个定时弹，一个落在洞口的铁轨当中。一个落在洞口上边。如果不把他搬走，急待通过的一列开往前方的火车，就要误时；若是爆炸，洞口就会坍塌，那阻碍就更大了，于是驻在当地的同志们，立刻动手把它弄走，用绳拉不动，就用手搬，以忘我的精神完成了任务。
    今年四月，敌机破坏了某江的大桥，铁路运输中断了。当时我志愿援朝铁路员工某部接受了在该桥附近江面建桥的任务。这是一个巨大的工程。该部接到这一任务后立即动工，潮水忽涨忽落，退潮后满是淤泥，有的地方下层还没有开冻。而敌机又经常来袭击，因此工作主要在晚上进行，更增加了工作的困难。深更半夜，四周一片漆黑，寒风吹在身上，格外寒冷，开工的头几天，还连日下着细雨。但同志们挑起土篮，扛起湿淋淋的草袋，忘我地工作。他们心里只有一个意念：“快点修好这座桥梁。把粮秣弹药运到前线去，消灭美国鬼子。”潮水涨上来了的时候，同志们就在水里工作。有时敌机来了，也不去隐蔽。大家都喊着：“多挑一筐土，就等于多给美国侵略军一刺刀。提前修好桥梁，支援前线打胜仗。”同志们就以这样的劳动热忱和爱国主义精神，在十五天内，就完成了这一伟大而艰巨的任务。
    勇士们还时常不顾敌机的袭击，保护和抢救重要的桥梁，共产党员苗俊成在某次夜间抢修时，曾两次冒着敌机的扫射，弄灭了桥上没有来得及弄灭的火把，使敌机失去了轰炸的目标。吕传海、陈永信两同志，在敌机以汽油弹烧着了我们的桥梁的时候，不顾敌机还在头顶的上空盘旋，奋勇前去抢救，使该桥未受损失。
    在工作中，同志们对材料极为爱护。某部四小队在执行修桥任务时，突然天降大雨、冰雪融化，江水暴涨，将已完成的百分之八十的木排架、木笼及其他一部材料，冲出六、七里地，该队知道后，立刻前去抢救。有的来不及脱衣服，就跳入江中，在冰冷的寒流中，奋勇抢救。有的同志被冰块打倒，掉入水里；有的身上被冰块撞破，鲜血直流，还坚持抢救，继续了六个钟头。结果抢出了被冲走的大部分材料。这不仅使国家资财少受损失，而且使抢修的工作不受影响。
    同志们还积极主动搜集材料。如某部的一个班在担任桥头警戒时，在党员于江龙、团员张士山等同志的带领下，在三天中，即搜集鱼尾钣一八四块、鱼尾螺丝一三三个、道钉七七一个、穿心钉二六一个、铁把据四四四个、螺丝垫圈、枕木一三根、铁丝三○公斤。
    在朝鲜铁路线上的志愿援朝铁路员们，就是以这样不怕任何艰苦的精神，用他们的血和汗，保护着运输线的畅通，从而保证了前方的胜利。
