Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Another Proof of US Imperialism Threatening Our National Security!
    US Planes Continuously Invade Our Coastal Areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang

    American imperialist planes have continuously invaded the coastal areas of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Zhejiang provinces on the 23rd and 25th of this month.
    On the 23rd, American planes invaded the waters of northern Jiangsu and the Qingdao and Rongcheng areas of Shandong. At 17:14 on the same day, an American plane was spotted 130 kilometers southeast of Dongtai County in northern Jiangsu. At 18:24, an American plane was spotted on Yin Island (a small island north of Qingdao). At 18:43, an American plane was spotted over Qingdao. At 18:48, an American plane was spotted over Taiping Mountain in Qingdao City. At 19:13, an American plane was spotted over Sifang, four kilometers north of Qingdao. At 19:15, four American planes were spotted over Cangkou, north of Qingdao. At 19:30, another five American planes were spotted over Cangkou. At 20:46, an American plane was spotted 30 kilometers northeast of Qingdao, flying west by south. At 20:49, an American plane was spotted five kilometers southeast of Qingdao. At 22:38, two American planes were spotted eight kilometers east of Qingdao, flying west, and at 22:39, the two planes changed direction and flew north. At 18:29, an American plane was spotted 184 kilometers southwest of Rongcheng (southeast of Weihai City), and at 20:26, another two American planes were spotted 174 kilometers southeast of the city.
    On the 25th, American planes invaded the areas of Zhenhai, Dinghai, Hangzhou, and Shanghai in Zhejiang. At 6:00 on the same day, four American planes appeared 135 kilometers northeast of Zhenhai, then flew east of Dinghai, southeast of Zhenhai, and southeast of Yuyao, reaching Hangzhou, and then flew northeast, disappearing over Langgang Mountain southeast of Shanghai at 6:52. Another two American planes invaded the airspace over Longhua in Shanghai City from the southeast at 6:31 on the same day, and then flew north, disappearing 255 kilometers southeast of Yancheng in northern Jiangsu.
    The fact that American planes have so frequently and rampantly violated our airspace in two consecutive days is another proof that the US government is adhering to its aggressive policy and threatening our national security. This mad aggressive behavior of the American air force against China obviously echoes its murderous actions in Kaesong. It is now even clearer that the US government is deliberately trying to end the peaceful negotiations with war. The Chinese people must continue to strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, especially to strengthen our air defense capabilities, increase efforts to donate aircraft, and consolidate national defense.

　　美帝国主义威胁我国安全又一证明！
    美机接连入侵我国江浙沿海
    美国政府蓄意要以战争终止停战谈判
    我国人民必须努力继续加强巩固国防
    【新华社二十六日讯】美帝国主义的飞机于本月二十三日、二十五日接连入侵我国江苏、山东、浙江等省沿海地区。
    二十三日，美国飞机曾入侵苏北海面及山东的青岛、荣城地区。当日十七时十四分苏北东台县城东南一百三十公里的海面上发现美国飞机一架。十八时二十四分阴岛（青岛以北小岛）发现美国飞机一架。十八时四十三分青岛上空发现美国飞机一架。十八时四十八分青岛市太平山上空发现美国飞机一架。十九时十三分青岛北四公里四方上空发现美国飞机一架。十九时十五分青岛北沧口上空发现美国飞机四架。十九时三十分沧口上空又发现美国飞机五架。二十时四十六分青岛东北三十公里处上空发现美国飞机一架向正西偏南飞去。二十时四十九分青岛东偏南五公里处发现美国飞机一架。二十二时三十八分青岛正东八公里处上空发现美国飞机两架向正西飞去，三十九分该两机又改向正北飞去。荣城（在威海市东南）西南一百八十四公里处上空于十八时二十九分发现美国飞机一架，二十时二十六分该城东南一百七十四公里处上空又发现美国飞机两架。
    二十五日，美国飞机曾侵入浙江的镇海、定海、杭州及上海等地区。当日六时，美机四架出现于镇海东北一百三十五公里处，随后飞经定海以东，镇海东南、和余姚东南达到杭州，随后又向东北方飞去，六时五十二分在上海东南的狼岗山上空消失。另有美国飞机两架于当日六时三十一分由东南方侵入上海市的龙华上空，随后向北飞往苏北盐城东南二百五十五公里处消失。
    美国飞机于接连两天之内这样频繁地猖獗地侵犯我国领空，这是美国政府坚持侵略政策威胁我国安全的又一证明。美国空军对中国的这种疯狂侵略行为，和它在开城的谋杀行为显然互相呼应。美国政府蓄意要以战争来终止和平的谈判，已经更加明显了。中国人民必须继续加强抗美援朝的斗争，尤其要加强自己的防空力量，加强捐献飞机和巩固国防的努力。
