　　Correctly Conduct the Inspection of Preferential Treatment Work
Currently, local people's governments and organizations have mostly begun inspections of preferential treatment work. The inspections in various places have proven that preferential treatment work has been successful in the past. At the same time, based on the shortcomings found during the inspections, practical and feasible improvement measures have been proposed, and some places have even initially launched mass preferential treatment movements. However, some local leading organs have not seriously valued this work and have not yet launched inspections of preferential treatment work to this day; or they have adopted an insufficiently serious attitude towards the inspection work. In places where inspections have already been carried out, there are still some shortcomings in the inspection work. Now that the "August 1st" Army Day has arrived, we hope that the local branches of this association and various people's organizations will cooperate with the people's governments at all levels to seize the time and do a good job in inspecting preferential treatment work. Based on the experience of various places, to do this work well, the following three points must be noted:

    First, it is necessary to check whether people from all walks of life have recognized the political significance of preferential treatment work, and whether preferential treatment work has become a mass movement. Recent inspection results in many places have proven that the reason why our preferential treatment work still has some shortcomings, and why the atmosphere of cherishing and respecting the families of martyrs, military families, and revolutionary disabled soldiers has not yet formed in some places, and some living and employment problems of some families of martyrs and military families have not been well resolved, is mainly because the cadres and patriotic activists have not conducted in-depth education on the preferential treatment policy to the masses. Therefore, some people do not understand the significance of preferential treatment work and mistakenly believe that this is only the government's business and has nothing to do with them. Therefore, when carrying out inspection work, various places should first check the public's understanding of preferential treatment work, so as to carry out publicity and education work to the masses during the inspection process or in the future. Only in this way can the public's understanding of preferential treatment work be improved, and a mass preferential treatment movement can be created. At present, the leading personnel in some places have ignored this point when inspecting preferential treatment work, which is obviously inappropriate.

    Second, leading cadres should examine their own understanding of preferential treatment work and make sincere self-criticism of past wrong understandings. This top-down inspection can play a good demonstration role among lower-level cadres and the masses, so that the inspection work can be carried out smoothly. Recently, some places have convened representatives' meetings of anti-American and aid-Korea campaigns, civil affairs meetings, or enlarged meetings of consultative committees, bringing together representative figures from all walks of life and cadres directly engaged in preferential treatment work, and conducting inspections of preferential treatment work from the perspective of leadership ideology, thereby smoothly promoting local inspection work. This approach is good. However, in individual places, the civil affairs departments only mobilize and organize people from all walks of life to inspect preferential treatment work, but they themselves do not conduct in-depth inspections of their own work and ideology to find out the shortcomings in past work in order to seek improvement. By doing this, it is impossible to effectively educate cadres and avoid past shortcomings and errors.

    Third, the inspection of preferential treatment work must be carried out with leadership and planning, and the tendency of laissez-faire must be strictly prevented. Some places have absorbed representatives from all walks of life and formed preferential treatment work inspection committees, and then organized the cadres participating in the inspection work and the activists among the masses to study relevant documents on preferential treatment work, explain the matters that should be paid attention to in the inspection work, and finally conduct inspections by districts in a planned manner. Some provincial and municipal people's governments have also organized preferential treatment work inspection teams to go down to conduct inspections. In the instructions on inspecting preferential treatment work, some provincial people's governments specifically stipulate that leading organs above the county and city level should personally inspect the preferential treatment work in two or three villages, two or three streets, or a factory and a school. This approach is good, because in this way, experience can be found on how to regularly do a good job in preferential treatment work in urban and rural areas, so as to effectively guide and promote local preferential treatment work. In contrast, individual places have adopted a frivolous attitude towards the inspection of preferential treatment work. Before the inspection, they neither educated the personnel participating in the inspection work, nor explained the policies and matters that should be paid attention to. The inspection was carried out in a hasty manner, and the "task" was completed in a perfunctory manner. Therefore, some inspection materials are not completely reliable or specific enough, so that it is impossible to effectively solve the difficulties of poor families of martyrs and military families. This approach should be corrected.

### 正确进行优抚工作的检查

　　正确进行优抚工作的检查
    目前各地人民政府和各机关团体，多已开始进行优抚工作的检查。各地的检查都证明，过去优抚工作是有成绩的，同时根据检查中所发现的缺点，提出了切实可行的改进办法，有些地方并已初步展开群众性的优抚运动。但是仍有一些地方的领导机关，没有认真重视这一工作，直到今天还没有展开优抚工作的检查；或者对于检查工作采取了不够认真的态度。而在已经进行了检查的地方，检查工作中也还存在着一些缺点。现在“八一”建军节已经到来了，我们希望本会各地分会、各人民团体配合各级人民政府，抓紧时间，做好优抚工作的检查。根据各地的经验，要把这个工作做好，有下面三点必须注意：
    第一、就是要检查各界人民是否已经认识优抚工作的政治意义，优抚工作是否已经成为群众性的运动。最近许多地方检查的结果证明，我们的优抚工作之所以还存在着一些缺点，有些地方还没有形成爱护和尊敬烈属、军属和革命残废军人的风气，部分烈属、军属的生活、就业等问题尚未得到很好的解决，主要原因是工作干部和爱国积极分子未向群众进行深入的优抚政策的教育，因而有些人还不了解优抚工作的意义，错误地认为这只是政府的事，与自己无关。因此各地在进行检查工作时，应首先检查群众对优抚工作的认识，以便在检查过程中或在以后继续向群众进行宣传教育工作。只有这样，才能提高群众对优抚工作的认识，才能造成群众性的优抚运动。目前有些地方的领导人员在检查优抚工作时忽略了这一点，显然是不妥当的。
    第二、领导干部要检查自己对优抚工作的认识，并对于过去的错误认识进行诚恳的自我批评。这种自上而下的检查，能够在下级干部和群众中起一种良好的示范作用，使检查工作顺利地开展起来。最近有些地方已召开了抗美援朝代表会议，民政会议或协商委员会扩大会议，把各界人民中有代表性的人物和直接从事优抚工作的干部聚集在一起，从领导思想上作了优抚工作的检查，因而顺利地推动了当地的检查工作。这种作法是好的。但也有个别地方的民政部门，只动员和组织各界人民检查优抚工作，而自己不从本身的工作和思想上作深入的检查，找出过去工作中的缺点，以求得改进。这样作，就不能有效地教育干部，避免过去的缺点和错误。
    第三、优抚工作的检查必须有领导有计划地进行，严格防止放任自流的倾向。有些地方已吸收各界代表人物，组成了优抚工作检查委员会，然后把参加检查工作的干部和群众中的积极分子组织起来，学习有关优抚工作的文件，说明检查工作中应注意的事项，最后才有计划地分区进行检查。有些省、市人民政府还组织了优抚工作检查组，到下面去进行检查。有的省人民政府在关于检查优抚工作的指示中，特别规定，县市以上的领导机关要亲自检查二、三个村，二、三条街或一个工厂和一个学校的优抚工作情况。这种作法是好的，因为这样可以找到如何在城市和农村中经常做好优抚工作的经验，从而有效地指导和推动当地的优抚工作。与此相反，个别地方对于优抚工作的检查，采取了轻率的态度，在检查前既未向参加检查工作的人员进行教育，说明政策及应注意的事项，检查又是采取草率的办法，马马虎虎一检查就全部完成“任务”，因而有些检查材料不尽可靠或不够具体，以致不能有效地为贫苦烈属、军属解决困难。这种作法是应该纠正的。
