　　Decision of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the Establishment of the Tanggu Port Construction Committee
    (Passed by the 99th Political Affairs Meeting of the State Administration Council on August 24, 1951, and promulgated by order on August 25)
    Due to natural conditions (narrow channels, shallow water, etc.) and years of disrepair, ships carrying more than 3,000 tons of cargo must be transshipped and reloaded, preventing them from directly reaching Tianjin for loading and unloading. This not only increases freight costs but, most importantly, fails to meet the increasing import and export trade demands. Therefore, completing the construction of the new Tanggu port is an urgent task. However, the construction of the new Tanggu port is an arduous project, and the current Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau is not capable enough in terms of tools, ships, cadres, and technology. It must be effectively led by the central government and fully utilize local forces. To this end, the following decisions are made:
    (1) Establish the Tanggu Port Construction Committee, directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Transport of the Central People's Government. Its responsibilities are to determine construction guidelines, guide major technologies, mobilize cadres and ships, solve difficulties in materials and tools, and strive to enable 10,000-ton ships to enter the new port for berthing, loading, and unloading by the winter of 1952.
    (2) The Tanggu Port Construction Committee shall be composed of the following fourteen members: Zhang Bojun, Huang Jing, Jing Renqiu, Gao Yuan, Zhang Guojian, Zhao Pu, Zhou Kegang, Tan Zhen, Liu Junfeng, Li An, Zhou Lun, Zhang Huakan, Yan Kai, and Zheng Zhaozhen; with Zhang Bojun as the chairman, and Huang Jing, Jing Renqiu, and Gao Yuan as the vice chairmen.
    (3) Strengthen the leadership of the New Port Engineering Bureau, appoint Li An as the Director of the New Port Engineering Bureau, and Zhou Lun as the Deputy Director. The New Port Engineering Bureau is directly under the leadership of the Tanggu Port Construction Committee.
    (4) The Haihe Engineering Department under the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government shall be managed by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government on behalf of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government. In addition to completing tasks such as Haihe dredging, ice breaking, and silt discharge, it shall also take into account the Tanggu port construction project, maximize the efficiency of ships, and complete the port construction task.

　　中央人民政府政务院关于成立塘沽建港委员会的决定
    （一九五一年八月二十四日政务院第九十九次政务会议通过并于八月二十五日命令发布）
    天津港口由于自然条件（航道狭窄、水浅等）的限制和年久失修，以致使满载三千吨以上货物的船只，均须经过驳运倒载，而不能直达天津装卸。这不仅增大了货运费用，而最主要地是不能应付日益增加的出入口贸易。因此，完成塘沽新港建设工程，已是刻不容缓的任务。但是修建塘沽新港是一件艰巨的工程，工具、船只、干部、技术等均非现在的塘沽新港工程局所能胜任，必须在中央强有力的领导下，并充分发挥地方力量，始克有效。为此特作如下决定：
    （一）成立塘沽建港委员会，直属中央人民政府交通部领导。其职责为确定修建方针，指导重大技术，调集干部和船只，解决材料、工具等困难，并争取于一九五二年冬季使万吨轮船能够驶入新港停泊装卸。
    （二）塘沽建港委员会决定由章伯钧、黄敬、靖任秋、高原、张国坚、赵朴、周克刚、谭真、刘俊峰、李安、周纶、张华戡、严恺、郑兆珍等十四人为委员组织之；并以章伯钧为主任委员，黄敬、靖任秋、高原为副主任委员。
    （三）加强新港工程局的领导，调李安为新港工程局局长，周纶为副局长，新港工程局直接受塘沽建港委员会领导。
    （四）中央人民政府水利部所属之海河工程处由天津市人民政府代管，其建制仍属中央人民政府水利部。除完成海河疏浚、破冰和放淤等任务外，兼顾塘沽建港工程，发挥船只的最大效率，完成筑港任务。
