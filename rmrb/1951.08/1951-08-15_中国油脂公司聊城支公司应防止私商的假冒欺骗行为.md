To the Editor:

Recently, the Liaocheng Branch of the China Oil Company purchased approximately 70,000 jin of peanut oil in Gaotang County. When this batch of peanut oil was transported from Gaotang to Linqing for loading onto ships and transshipment to Xinxiang, inspections revealed that about ten barrels, approximately 3,700 jin, were entirely soybean oil, one barrel was almost entirely oil sludge, and the remaining hundred-plus barrels were mostly mixed with soybean oil and sanitary oil, and some had already gone bad and deteriorated. In addition, each barrel contained two to three jin of oil sludge. Based on the above situation, it is estimated that each jin of peanut oil will lose an average of 300 yuan, and 70,000 jin will lose a total of 21 million yuan. It is said that when one hundred barrels of peanut oil were shipped to Linqing on July 25, five barrels of soybean oil were discovered at that time. The cadre in charge of transportation at the Liaocheng Branch of the China Oil Company in Linqing reported this situation to the company and requested instructions on how to handle it. The company's reply was: "Our oil is purchased on our behalf by private merchants, and they are not responsible for returns or exchanges once the goods leave their premises. Now, we can only sell the soybean oil in Linqing and ship the rest to Xinxiang." The next day, five barrels of soybean oil were again found in the eighteen barrels of peanut oil that were shipped, but the Liaocheng Branch accepted all the losses itself.

This issue shows how little the Liaocheng Branch values state assets! They bought peanut oil, but soybean oil was delivered, and they used the "reason" that "private merchants are not responsible for returns or exchanges once the goods leave their premises" as an excuse not to investigate. If no fake or bad goods can be returned or exchanged once the goods leave their premises, then why didn't the company carefully inspect the goods when they left the premises? We hope that the company can seriously review this point.

### 中国油脂公司聊城支公司应防止私商的假冒欺骗行为

    中国油脂公司聊城支公司应防止私商的假冒欺骗行为编辑同志：
    中国油脂公司聊城支公司最近在高唐县收购了七万斤左右的花生油。这批花生油从高唐运到临清装船转运新乡时，经检查发现内有十桶约三千七百斤完全是豆油，有一桶差不多完全是油泥，其余一百多桶大都掺有豆油与卫生油，而且有的已经变味变质。此外，每桶又都含有二、三斤油泥。根据以上情况估计，每斤花生油平均要损失三百元，七万斤共要损失二千一百万元。据说在七月二十五日有一百桶花生油运到临清时，当时即发现其中有五桶是豆油。中国油脂公司聊城支公司在临清负责办理运输的干部把这个情况向公司方面作了报告，并请示处理办法。该公司的答复却说：“我们的油是委托私商代购的，人家是货物出门不管退换，现在只有将豆油留在临清出售，其他仍运新乡。”第二天运来的十八桶花生油内又发现五桶豆油，但是这一切都由聊城支公司自认了损失。
    这一问题说明聊城支公司是多么不重视国家资财！买的是花生油，而运来了豆油，他们却以“私商的货物出门不管退换”为“理由”就不去查究了。既然货物出门不管什么假货、坏货就全不能退换了，那末，在货物出门时，该公司为什么又不认真检查呢？对于这一点，我们希望该公司能认真检讨一下。
