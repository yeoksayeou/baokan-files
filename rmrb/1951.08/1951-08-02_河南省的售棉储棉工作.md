Henan Province's Cotton Purchase and Storage Work
Henan Provincial Department of Commerce Director Li Yousan, Special Correspondent Liu Guoming

	Achievements are Not Yet Satisfactory
Henan Province's cotton purchase and storage work was deployed on June 5th. In the 35 days up to July 10th, over 3.1 million jin of ginned cotton have been purchased. Luoyang, Shanzhou, and Nanyang prefectures have purchased the largest quantities. Luoyang prefecture has purchased over 900,000 jin, Shanzhou prefecture has purchased over 750,000 jin, and Nanyang prefecture has purchased over 590,000 jin (Henan's cotton-producing areas are mainly Luoyang and Shanzhou prefectures, followed by Nanyang, Shangqiu, and Huaiyang prefectures. Xuchang, Zhengzhou, and Chenliu prefectures also have a portion). Judging from the progress of purchases, although the figures are gradually increasing each ten-day period, indicating that the movement is gradually deepening, the progress between periods is not significant. Even in the first ten days of this month, which is estimated to be the peak of the movement, only over 120,000 jin were purchased. This achievement is not satisfactory.

	Attention is Paid to Organizing Purchase Forces
Simultaneous with the Henan Provincial People's Government's deployment of cotton purchase work, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice to the entire party, requiring party members to take the lead in ensuring the completion of this task. The Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Provincial Women's Federation, the Provincial Cooperative General Society, and the Provincial Branch of the People's Bank also issued calls and instructions to their respective subordinates. In terms of purchase organizations, the relevant administrative and business departments are all unified under the leadership of the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, with unified tasks and unified forces. In addition to the existing business organizations of the cotton, yarn, and cloth companies and the grassroots cooperatives responsible for purchases in each prefecture and county, forces are drawn from various departments to form purchase teams. Shanzhou prefecture has now organized 44 purchase teams, Shangqiu prefecture has organized 39, and the number of purchase teams in the province has increased from the initial 118 to the recent 199. Each prefecture and county attaches importance to the organization of purchase forces. Lingbao county alone has organized 700 personnel for business, purchase, storage, and transportation.

	There are Some Ideological Problems Among the Masses and Cadres
At the beginning of the purchase, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government Niu Peicong went to Nanyang, and Director of the Department of Commerce Li Yousan went to Shanzhou to deploy the work, which greatly promoted the purchase work in these two prefectures. However, once the purchase work reached the grassroots level, more problems arose.

Among the masses: The common thinking among rich peasants and middle peasants is "fear of standing out" and "fear of increasing their class status." Some poor peasants and hired laborers who have cotton are afraid of being criticized for "not being honest" because they received fruits during the land reform. Some peasants still have the psychology from the past hyperinflation that saving goods is better than saving money. As for hoping to sell at a higher price, this is a common psychology. In some places, the purchase of cotton and the summer grain tax and increased production donations were promoted to the lower levels simultaneously, but the principle that donations are voluntary and based on increased production was not clearly explained, which also caused peasants to worry that they would have to make donations if they sold cotton. In addition, some cotton farmers have entered into pre-purchase contracts with cotton, yarn, and cloth companies, fearing that if the cotton harvest is poor in the autumn, they will not be able to deliver it, so they keep the cotton as a "backup."

Among the cadres: Initially, some local cadres did not pay enough attention, and did not pay attention to explaining the policies in depth and carrying out ideological mobilization, thinking that it was enough to assign the tasks. Because they did not pay enough attention and did not grasp it tightly, they were slow from the beginning. This was the case in Shangqiu and Huaiyang prefectures. Another situation is that the specific difficulties of the work were underestimated, and the actual cotton storage situation of cotton farmers in various places was not understood. Therefore, some places did not do a good enough job in deepening the publicity of policies and dispelling the concerns of the masses, and the phenomena of coercion and quotas occurred. For example, some assigned the cotton purchase to the villages at each level (the situation was more serious in some areas of Luyi), some held township representative meetings to let the representatives self-report and publicly discuss the "task" figures, some forced the masses to "sign" to guarantee that they would not keep even one or two liang of cotton, some searched for cotton from house to house, some forcibly sealed up spinning wheels and looms during the publicity, and some allocated cotton in proportion to the public grain. Although these are only phenomena in individual areas, they still caused anxiety among the masses.

	A Detour Was Taken in the Price Policy
In terms of price policy, a detour was taken at the beginning of the purchase. The rising market situation of cotton prices and the peasants' idea of waiting for higher prices influenced the cadres, so that some cadres also shouted "The listed price is low and it is not easy to purchase." As a result, the provincial company's method of rewarding (a reward of 1% for selling more than 50 jin of cotton, gradually increasing to 4% for more than 500 jin), which was designed to encourage large quantities of cotton to be sold directly to the county cotton, yarn, and cloth companies and contained a subsidy for some transportation costs, was also generally implemented in various purchasing stations. Later, after the purchase price adjusted by the Central South Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company was issued, the price was raised again. In this way, the price of cotton was actually repeatedly increased in the cotton purchase, giving cotton farmers greater benefits, but the result of doing so had little encouragement for the sale of cotton, and on the other hand, it strengthened the psychology of some farmers "The more expensive it is, the less I will sell," hoping to continue to rise.

	In-depth Inspection and Timely Correction of Deviations
Because the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee tightly grasped the cotton purchase work, the situation was reported and corrective instructions were given quickly, so the tendency of cadres not paying attention to this work, the economicist tendency of only circling around prices, and the commandist quota deviations in a few areas were quickly prevented and corrected, and did not cause serious impact.

In order to understand the actual situation of cotton purchase work in various places, the Provincial People's Government organized two inspection teams on June 21st and 22nd to go to Shangqiu and Huaiyang prefectures in eastern Henan and Shanzhou and Luoyang prefectures in western Henan for inspection. After the inspection team of the Provincial People's Government left, Huaiyang prefecture also organized an inspection team to go to Taikang for inspection. In order to correct the quota deviation, the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee stipulated: The allocated cotton collection figures can only be used as a reference. The real task is to mobilize all the scattered stored cotton for sale and storage; it is strictly forbidden to adopt the wrong practice of blindly assigning quotas based on the allocated figures without regard to the actual situation; and it is strictly stipulated that the allocated figures can only reach the district, and the villages below the district should rely on publicity to mobilize sales and storage, and no figures should be assigned.

The experience gained from this stage of work can be roughly summarized as follows:

	Attention Should be Paid to Ideological Mobilization
1. First of all, it is necessary to do a good job in publicity and mobilization of rural cadres, party members, league members, and activists. It is not enough to just hold a representative meeting and hand over the tasks to them, but to fully explain the policies and principles to them, rely on their leading actions and in-depth household promotion, so that the peasants consciously and voluntarily sell and store the stored cotton to the state. In the mobilization, it is necessary to use patriotism and the principle of strengthening the worker-peasant alliance for persuasion and propaganda, conduct mass line education, and strictly correct the one-sided economic interest point of view and certain coercive command styles. Some cadres underestimate the peasants' patriotic consciousness, thinking that they must use high profits to encourage them. This idea has been completely proved to be wrong in fact. In some places, cadres do not understand the importance of ideological mobilization, but let the masses self-report, and after reporting, sign a pledge that "the stored cotton has been sold out." This threatening approach actually increases the concerns of the masses, making them unwilling to sell even the cotton that could have been sold.

	In-depth Investigation Can Increase Cadre Confidence
2. Constantly going deeper to understand the situation is an effective way to prevent cadres' commandism and loss of confidence. After preliminary publicity in Shiqiao Township, Yanshi, when resident group leaders were convened to self-report the stored cotton, only more than 200 jin of cotton were reported. A few cadres felt that there was very little cotton in everyone's hands and their confidence was not high, but after continuing to mobilize and going deeper to understand the situation, when everyone was convened again to self-report, the reported cotton exceeded the original report by fifteen times. Cadres in Huiluo Town, Gong County, were also initially not confident; after the leaders organized forces to focus on investigating the stored cotton, they found five representative peasant households and one rich peasant household. The investigation results: the average cotton storage of three middle peasant households accounted for 26% of their cotton production last year, the cotton storage of two poor peasant households accounted for 15% of their production last year, and the cotton storage of one rich peasant household accounted for 30% of their production last year. This greatly strengthened the confidence of the cadres.

According to the investigation, of the total cotton production in Henan last year, cotton tax accounted for about 14.14%, cotton used by farmers for their own use and sold as native cloth accounted for about 37.38%, and state-owned trade purchases accounted for about 39.9%. It is estimated that the current cotton storage of farmers is still 8.58%. A typical investigation of eight households in Daying Town, Shanzhou District, showed that poor peasants stored 17%, middle peasants stored 22%, and rich peasants stored 51%. The current cotton storage of middle and poor peasants in Taikang accounts for one-third of the cotton purchased. An investigation of two villages in Shan County showed that the cotton storage accounted for 21% of the total output. The general cotton storage in each prefecture is about 20%. Judging from the amount of cotton on the market and the transaction volume: the amount of cotton on the market in the first ten days of July increased five times compared with the last ten days of June, and the transaction volume increased four times. The amount of cotton on the market in Guoying Town, Zhengzhou District, increased three times per market. Judging from the quantity of purchases, the amount of cotton purchased in the first half of July in the province exceeded 4.1% of the total amount of cotton purchased in June. In half a month, the amount of cotton purchased in Nanyang and Shanzhou prefectures increased by 50% to 70%. Xuchang and Luoyang increased by one or two times. Zhengzhou District increased by eight times compared with the previous month. Based on the above materials and the development of the movement in various places, as long as the greatest efforts are made subjectively, there are conditions and guarantees to complete the task of purchasing and storing cotton.

	The Movement is Deepening, and There are Still Some Problems to be Solved
Now the cotton sales and storage movement is deepening, and the cotton-grain price ratio is generally completely normal or close to normal; leaders at all levels generally attach importance to this work. The commissioners or deputy commissioners of the three prefectures of Shangqiu, Shanzhou, and Zhengzhou have gone down to inspect and promote it, and the responsible comrades of Lingbao, Wenxiang, Yanshi, and other counties have also gone down one after another. Leaders taking the lead and doing it themselves is still a very important key in promoting the work. However, there are still some problems in the current work: some purchase team cadres were drawn from various aspects, and their internal unity is not good enough, which affects the work; in the use of private merchants to carry out purchases, most areas still do not pay enough attention, and some who have paid attention only hire private merchants to collect cotton on behalf of them, giving them a few jin of wheat every day, but have not made good use of the original strength of private merchants and their traditional contacts with farmers; in some places, the grassroots administrative forces and business forces do not cooperate well enough. The administrative forces have been mobilized, and the farmers actively sell and store cotton, but the business departments have bureaucratic styles, not collecting after the time has passed, and being harsh to the farmers, which will also affect the development of cotton sales; the coercive command style in some areas still needs to be corrected with continued efforts; market management still needs to be strengthened, etc. But the most important issue is that the summer grain tax has entered a tense stage. How can the two tasks of summer grain tax and cotton purchase be combined well, so that neither the summer grain tax is relaxed due to the cotton purchase, nor the cotton purchase is relaxed due to grasping the summer grain tax? According to the original plans of Luoyang, Shanzhou, and Nanyang prefectures, they all prepared to basically complete the cotton sales and storage work before mid-July or the end of the month and turn to the summer grain tax. Therefore, at that time, there may be a thought of relaxing in the cotton purchase and storage work. Judging from the current progress of purchases, there is no doubt that this idea is very dangerous for completing the cotton purchase task. Secondly, how to deepen the publicity and mobilization work in a planned and organized manner is also very important.

　　河南省的售棉储棉工作
    河南省商业厅厅长李友三本报特约记者  刘国明
            成绩还不能令人满意
    河南全省售棉储棉工作，从六月五日布置下去，到七月十日，这三十五天中已收购了皮棉三百一十多万斤，其中以洛阳、陕州、南阳三个专区收购数量较大。洛阳专区已收购九十多万斤，陕州专区已收购七十五万多斤，南阳专区已收起五十九万多斤（河南产棉区主要是洛阳、陕州两专区，其次是南阳、商邱、淮阳专区，许昌、郑州、陈留专区也有一部分）。从收购进度上看，虽然每旬数字在逐渐增加，说明运动正在逐步深入展开；但旬与旬间进度不大，直到本月上旬，估计应该是运动进入高潮的时候，也才收购了十二万多斤，这个成绩是不能令人满意的。
            对于组织收购力量是重视的
    和河南省人民政府布置购棉工作同时，中共河南省委向全党发出通知，要求党员带头保证这一任务的完成。青年团省委、省妇联、省合作总社、人民银行省分行也分别对所属发出号召和指示，在收购机构上，有关的行政、业务部门，都统一由省财政经济委员会领导，统一任务、统一力量。各专区、县除原已设立的花纱布公司业务机构及合作社基层社负责收购外，并从各部门抽调力量组织收购小组，陕州专区现已组织了四十四个收购组，商邱专区组织了三十九个，全省的收购小组已由最初的一百一十八个增至最近的一百九十九个，各专区、县对于组织收购力量这一方面是重视的，仅灵宝一县组织的业务收购保管运输人员即达七百人。
            群众和干部思想上有些问题
    收购开始时省人民政府牛佩琮副主席曾到南阳，商业厅李友三厅长曾到陕州布置，对这两专区的收购工作起了很大推动作用。但收购工作一到基层，问题就多起来。
    在群众方面：富农和中农较普遍的思想是“怕冒尖”、“怕提高成份”；贫雇农一部分有棉花的，因为土地改革时分了果实，这时卖棉花怕人家批评“不老实”；有些农民还存在着过去通货膨胀时的心理认为存钱不如存货；至于希望多卖价钱，更是普遍心理；还有些地方因为把购棉和夏征、增产捐献同时向下面宣传，而又没有讲清楚捐献是自愿的和以增产为基础的原则，也引起了农民怕卖了棉花就得捐献的顾虑。另外有些棉农因和花纱布公司定了预购合同，怕秋后万一棉花歉收，交不上去，所以就留着棉花“防后手”。
    在干部方面：最初有些地方干部不够重视，没注意深入地说明政策，进行思想动员，以为把任务分配下去就行了。因为不够重视，抓得不紧，所以一开始就慢了一步。商邱、淮阳两专区就有此种情形。再一种情形是对工作的具体困难估计不足，对各地棉农确实存棉情形不摸底；因此在深入宣传政策、打破群众顾虑方面，有些地方做得不够好，发生了强迫命令和摊派的现象。如有的把购棉层层摊派到村（鹿邑部分地区较严重），有的开乡代表会让代表自报公议“任务”数字，有的强迫群众“画押”保证不留一两棉，也有挨户搜棉的，有宣传强制把纺花车、织布机封起来的，有按公粮分配折交棉花的，这些虽只是个别地区的现象；但仍然引起了群众的不安。
            在价格政策上走了一段弯路
    在价格政策上，开始收购时曾走了一段弯路。棉价看涨的市场情况和农民的等待高价的思想，曾影响到干部中间，以致部分干部跟着也喊“牌价低，不易收购”，结果是省公司规定的为了鼓励大宗直接向县花纱布公司售棉、并含有补贴一部运费性质的提奖办法（售棉在五十斤以上的奖百分之一，逐步提高至五百斤以上的百分之四），在各收购站也普遍实行了；以后中南花纱布公司调整了的购棉价格下达以后，又提了一次价。这样，实际是在购棉中把棉价一再提高，使棉农得到较大利益，但这样做的结果对于售棉所起鼓舞作用很小，而另方面却加强了部分农民“越贵越不卖”的心理，希望继续上涨。
            深入检查及时纠正偏向
    由于省财政经济委员会对购棉工作抓得紧，情况反映和纠正指示较迅速，所以干部中的不重视这一工作的倾向，只在价格方面绕圈子的经济主义的倾向，以及少数地区的命令主义的摊派偏向，都很快地得到防止和纠正，没有造成严重影响。
    为了了解各地购棉工作实际情况，省人民政府曾于六月二十一、二十二日组织了两个检查组分赴河南东部的商邱、淮阳两专区及河南西部的陕州、洛阳两专区检查；在省人民政府检查组去了以后，淮阳专区也组织检查组赴太康检查，为了纠正摊派的偏向，省财政经济委员会规定：分配的收棉数字，只能作为参考，真正任务是把分散的存棉，全部动员售储出来；绝对禁止片面根据分配数字、不问实际情况强行摊派的错误作法；并且严格规定，分配数字只能到区，区以下的乡村应依靠宣传动员售储，不得分配数字。
    从这一阶段的工作中得出来的经验，大致说来有以下几点：
            应该注意进行思想动员
    一、首先要做好对乡村干部、党员团员和积极分子的宣传动员工作。不能只是开个代表会把任务交给他们，而要向他们充分讲明政策道理，依靠他们的带头行动和深入挨户推动，使农民自觉自愿地把存棉售储给国家。在动员中，要用爱国主义和加强工农联盟的道理进行说服宣传，进行群众路线的教育，严格纠正片面的经济利益观点和某些强迫命令作风。有些干部过低估计农民的爱国觉悟，以为必须用高利来鼓励，这种思想已在事实上证明是完全错误的。有些地方，干部不了解思想动员的重要，而让群众自报，并在报出之后具结“已把存棉售完”。这种威胁的方式，实际上增大了群众的顾虑，使原来可以出售的棉花也不肯出售了。
            深入调查可以提高干部信心
    二、不断深入摸底是防止干部命令主义和丧失信心的有效办法。偃师石桥乡最初经过初步宣传，召开居民小组长自报存棉时，只报出了二百多斤棉花，少数干部就觉得大家手里棉花很少，信心不高，但经过继续动员，深入摸底，再召集大家自报时，报出的棉花就超出了原报的十五倍。巩县回廓镇干部起初也是信心不高；经领导上组织力量重点进行存棉调查，找出有代表性的五户农民和一户富农。调查结果：三户中农平均存棉占其去年产棉的百分之二十六，两户贫农存棉占其去年产量的百分之十五，富农一户，存棉占其去年产量的百分之三十。这就大大加强了干部的信心。
    根据调查，河南去年产棉总数中赋棉约占百分之十四点一四，农民自用及外销土布用棉约占百分之三十七点三八，国营贸易收购约占百分之三十九点九，估计目前农民存棉仍有百分之八点五八。陕州区大营镇八户典型调查，贫农存百分之十七，中农存百分之二十二，富农存百分之五十一，太康中农贫农棉农现存棉量尚占收棉量的三分之一。陕县两个村调查，存棉量占总产量百分之二十一。各专区一般存棉均在百分之二十左右。从上市量与成交量看：七月上旬较六月下旬上市量增加五倍，成交量增加四倍。郑州区古荥镇每集上市量增加三倍。从收购数量上看，全省七月上半月收棉数超过六月份总收棉数的百分之四·一。半月中，南阳、陕州两专区收棉数增加百分之五十至七十。许昌、洛阳增加一倍或两倍。郑州区则较上月增加八倍。根据以上材料和各地运动发展的情形，只要主观上作最大的努力，完成购、储棉任务是有条件、有把握的。
            运动正在深入展开，还有一些问题亟待解决
    现在售棉储棉运动正在深入展开，棉粮比价一般的已完全正常或接近正常；各级领导干部一般是重视这一工作的，商邱、陕州、郑州三个专区的专员或副专员已下去检查推动，灵宝、阌乡、偃师等县负责同志也都纷纷下去。领导干部带头，亲自动手，这在推动工作中还是极重要的关节。但目前工作上也还存在着一些问题：有些收购组干部因为是各方面抽调的，内部团结不够好，因而影响了工作；在运用私商力量进行收购上，大部分地区还重视不够，有些注意了的也只是把私商雇佣过来，每天给多少斤小麦使代收棉，而未很好地运用私商原来的一套力量和其与农民的传统来往联系；有些地方基层行政力量和业务力量配合得不够好，行政力量动员起来了，农民积极售棉储棉了，但业务部门却存在着官僚作风，过了时间不收，对农民要厉害，这也会影响售棉的开展；部分地区的强迫命令作风还待继续努力纠正；市场管理还须注意加强等。但一个最重要的问题则是夏征进入紧张阶段了，如何才能使夏征、购棉两项工作结合好，既不因购棉而放松夏征，也不要因抓夏征而放松购棉。按洛阳、陕州、南阳三个专区原来计划，都准备在七月中旬或月底以前，把售棉储棉工作基本完成，转入夏征，因此届时在购储棉工作上可能产生松一松的思想。从现在的收购进度看，无疑问这个思想对完成购棉任务是十分危险的。其次，如何把宣传动员工作有计划有组织地深入一步，也是十分重要的。
