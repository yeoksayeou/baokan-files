　　　　The Commercial Press Achieves Preliminary Success in Sorting Out Old Books and Periodicals
　　In order to do a good job in sorting out old books and periodicals, the Commercial Press took advantage of this summer vacation to conduct a more in-depth inspection of books and periodicals that had been decided to be suspended from sale. As of the first half of July, the preliminary results are as follows: 1. A decision was made to stop selling and destroy 76 types of books; 2. Three types of special books are sold with certificates from government agencies and organizations; 3. Five types of books will be sold until they are out of stock. This approach of the Commercial Press is good, but it should be checked more deeply and strictly. For example, the book "Soviet Education," which is included in the third category of the inspection results, "books to be sold until out of stock," should be included in the category of books to be destroyed (this book was criticized in issue 3 of volume 3 of "People's Education"). We hope that the library will persevere in this inspection work to the end, because according to the quantity and situation of all the library's publications, this achievement cannot be overestimated.

　　　　"Shandong Literature and Art" Improves Towards Popularization
　　"Shandong Literature and Art," run by the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, has changed its editorial policy since the first issue of the third volume, changed to a 25-open small book, and determined that it will strive for popularization and localization in the future, in order to provide the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers with singing materials, and take guiding mass literary and artistic activities and mass creation as its main tasks. In the article "Work with the Masses to Run 'Shandong Literature and Art' Well," the editorial department reviewed that "Shandong Literature and Art" has failed to meet the needs of the broad masses in terms of cultural and entertainment life in the past year, and has shortcomings such as "the articles written are incomprehensible to the masses, and the forms used are not very popular with the masses." In the same period, some drum lyrics,快板(kuaiban), small-tune operas, and song and dance dramas have been published, and the content is mostly combined with the local central work and the major political movements currently underway in the country. For example, the song and dance drama "Storing Cotton" takes storing cotton as its theme. This is a small script that can be provided for rural theater troupes to sing. The improvement of "Shandong Literature and Art" in popularization and localization is a good start. (Editor's note: In the "Cultural Life News" column on page 3 of this newspaper on July 30, the phrase "Shandong Literature and Art" has now been discontinued" in the section "Literary and Art Publications in Various Provinces Have Improved in Popularization" should be corrected to "Shandong Literature and Art" has now been revised and changed its editorial policy.")

            商务印书馆整理旧存书刊得到初步成绩
    商务印书馆为做好旧存书刊的整理工作，趁此暑假期间对原来已经决定暂停发售的书刊进行了较深入的检查。截至七月上半月止，其初步结果如下：一、决定停售绝版销毁的书七十六种；二、凭机关团体证件出售的特种书三种；三、售完为止的书五种。商务印书馆这种做法是好的，但还应该更深入、更严密地检查。例如列入检查结果中第三类“售完为止的书中“苏维埃的教育”一书就是应该列入销毁一类的书（对这本书，《人民教育》三卷三期曾提出批评）。我们希望该馆把这一检查工作坚持到底，因为按该馆全部出版物的数量和情况说，对这一成绩是不能给予过高估计的。
            《山东文艺》向通俗化方向改进
    山东省文联办的《山东文艺》自三卷一期起变更编辑方针，改为二十五开小本，确定今后向通俗化、地方化方向努力，以供给广大工农兵群众演唱材料，并以指导群众性的文艺活动和群众创作为主要任务。在《和群众一起，办好〈山东文艺〉》一文里，编辑部检讨了一年来《山东文艺》没有能够满足广大群众文娱生活方面的要求，“写的文章群众看不懂，也听不懂。所用的形式群众也不很欢迎”等缺点。同期内已发表了一些鼓词、快板、小调剧、歌舞剧，内容也大都结合当地的各项中心工作和当前正在全国进行的重大政治运动。如歌舞剧《存棉》，即以存棉储棉为主题。这是一个可以供给农村剧团演唱的小型剧本。《山东文艺》在通俗化、地方化工作上的改进，是一个好的开端。（编者按：本报七月三十日三版《文化生活动态》栏内，“各省文艺刊物在通俗化工作上有改进”一节内，“《山东文艺》现已停刊”应更正为“《山东文艺》现已改版，并改变编辑方针”。）
