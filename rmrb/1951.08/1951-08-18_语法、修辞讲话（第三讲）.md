Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 3)

    Section 7: Zai, Cong, Dang

    Zai yu (在于 - "lies in"). Of all the verbs, perhaps the word "zai (在 - in, at, on)" appears most frequently, second only to "shi (是 - is)". The most common usage of "zai" is in conjunction with locational words like "li (里 - inside)", "zhong (中 - middle)", "shang (上 - above, on)", and "xia (下 - below, under)", equivalent to certain prepositions in European languages. This will be explained in detail in the following sections. Now, let's first discuss "zai yu," which is only used as the main verb.

    The subjects of "zai yu" are quite limited. The most common are "purpose," "key," "problem," "importance," and the like. Secondly, there are "reason," "advantage," "disadvantage," etc. (using "shi" is more common than "zai yu" with these). It is generally not permissible to use a phrase or sentence form instead of these nouns, except for habitual expressions like "lai yu bu lai zai yu ni (来与不来在于你 - whether to come or not lies with you)". For example:

    (1) Taking one or more things as the object, carefully dissecting or analyzing, abstracting or refining, inducting or synthesizing, etc., mainly lies in clarifying the essence, attributes, relationships, or development of the object. (Teaching material)

    (2) A person's plasticity is greatest in youth; what a person becomes mainly lies in the education received in youth. (Teaching material)

    (3) The reason why the exhibition is popular lies in its use of concrete objects and vivid pictures to explain the problem. (Periodical)

    In (1), using "zai" to represent "the purpose lies in," and in (2), using "zai" to represent "the key lies in," are both inappropriate. In (3), "yin wei (因为 - because)" is more explicit than "zai yu."

    Zai...zhong (在……中 - in...middle). Using "zai...zhong" to indicate space and time is extremely common, and errors are unlikely. What is discussed here are several extended usages. In the following examples, readers should be able to distinguish which sentences are correct and which are incorrect:

    (4) Among these four classes, the working class occupies the leading position.

    (5) Among the twenty-three teaching and research groups in our school, they can be roughly divided into three types. (Newspaper)

    (6) Let them transform themselves in labor and become new people. (Mao Zedong)

    (7) The great era of revolution has shown us the ocean of life, Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought has armed our minds, and in the arduous War of Resistance and the War of Liberation, we have further strengthened our ties with the masses. (Teaching material)

    (8) This case is still under investigation and research and cannot be announced for the time being.

    (9) We can say that American culture is now in a state of stagnation. (Newspaper)

    (4), (6), and (8) are correct. In (5), remove "zai" and "zhong," or change "ke fen wei (可分为 - can be divided into)" to "you (有 - has/have)". In (7), remove "zai" and "zhong," otherwise "jia jin (加紧 - strengthen)" has no subject. (9) "Zai...zhong" can only indicate an ongoing action and cannot be used for "ting zhi (停止 - stop)", it should be changed to "yi jing (已经 - already)".

    Zai...shang (在……上 - in/on...above). The extended usage also needs attention, for example:

    (10) Sun Yat-sen... on the question of how to fight against imperialism, reached a basically consistent conclusion with us. (Mao Zedong)

    This "zai...shang" is also often used incorrectly. For example:

    (11) Although he is also responsible for cutting out a lot of materials, his attitude towards work is not correct. (Periodical)

    (12) In terms of teachers, there are only four teachers for the physical education classes of more than two thousand students. (Periodical)

    (13) On the issue of the relationship between land reform and women's liberation, the provincial party committee's instructions said... (Periodical)

    (14) This sideline production is the best way to support the masses through the current famine. (Draft)

    (15) In their method of looking at problems, they only see the temporary phenomena and shortcomings of some workers, and do not see the essence and advantages of the workers. (Book)

    In (11), "zai" and "shang" should be removed, otherwise, this clause has no subject. (The word "shi" is also unnecessary.) (12) should be "zai...fangmian (在……方面 - in...aspect)". (13) is better said as "guanyu (关于 - regarding) the relationship between land reform and women's liberation." (14) should be said as "is the best way to help the masses get through the current famine." In (15), first remove "zai" and "shang," so that "method" becomes the subject of "shi," but this sentence is still not very smooth and should be changed to "Their method of looking at problems is wrong; they only see..."

    Zai... (zhi) xia (在……（之）下 - under). In modern writing, "zai... (zhi) xia" is used even more extensively than "zai...zhong" or "zai...shang." In terms of form, the most common nouns embedded in the middle are "qingkuang (情况 - situation)" and "tiaojian (条件 - condition)", followed by "yuanze (原则 - principle)", "zhengce (政策 - policy)", "jingshen (精神 - spirit)", "taidu (态度 - attitude)", and so on. These nouns are often preceded by long or short modifiers that explain what kind of situation, condition, principle, etc., it is. There are nouns that have been converted from verbs, such as "lingdao (领导 - leadership)", "zhidao (指导 - guidance)", "zhipei (支配 - control)", "jiandu (监督 - supervision)", "aihu (爱护 - care)", "bangzhu (帮助 - help)", "nuli (努力 - effort)", "canjia (参加 - participate)", "baozheng (保证 - guarantee)", "peiyang (培养 - cultivate)", "jiaoyu (教育 - education)", "shuofu (说服 - persuade)", "zhenya (镇压 - suppress)", "po hai (迫害 - persecute)", and many more. (Many of these can only be regarded as predicate verbs of subject-predicate phrases and have not been completely transformed into nouns.) Secondly, there are phrase or sentence forms, such as "ren wu ke ren (忍无可忍 - unbearable)", "wu ji ke shi (无计可施 - at one's wit's end)", "liang zhou ye he bu dao shui (两昼夜喝不到水 - not drinking water for two days and nights)", and so on. "Zai ren wu ke ren zhi xia (在忍无可忍之下 - under unbearable circumstances)" is obviously incorrect, but as long as "de qingkuang (的情况 - the situation)" is added here, it conforms to the first format. It can be seen that judging whether "zai...xia" is used correctly cannot be based solely on form.

    From the point of view of meaning, it is also not easy to judge. What kind of concept does "zai...xia" represent after all? "Zai mou zhong tiaojian zhi xia (在某种条件之下 - under certain conditions)" takes something as a condition, which is a restriction. "Zai mou zhong qingkuang zhi xia (在某种情况之下 - under certain circumstances)" means that under this circumstance, there can only be or there will naturally be certain things, which also has a restrictive meaning, but also carries a bit of causality. However, when using "yuanze", "zhengce", "jingshen", "taidu", it is difficult to say that there is a restrictive meaning. "Zai mou mou de lingdao zhi xia (在某某的领导之下 - under the leadership of someone)" can be literally interpreted as under the leadership of someone, and the same is true for "zhipei", "jiandu", etc., but "nuli", "canjia", etc. cannot be said in this way. It can be seen that the connotation of "zai...xia" is not only diverse but also very broad and very difficult to grasp.

    Perhaps we should look at it from the opposite side, seeing if other words can express the meaning more clearly than "zai...xia" in a certain sentence. At this time, it will be discovered that it cannot be rigidly said that using which two characters in the middle of "zai...xia" is definitely right, and using which two characters is definitely wrong. The same "zai...qingkuang zhi xia", maybe it works in this sentence, but not in that sentence. Everything depends on the specific situation. The "zai...xia" in the following sentences can be replaced by other words to make the meaning clearer.

    (16) Since the start of work in January and February, the project has progressed rapidly due to the active work of the Sanitation Engineering Bureau and the workers and troops participating in the work, regardless of fatigue and cold... (Newspaper)

    (17) Jia Sanliu, who historically did not work much, joined the mutual aid group under Gao Goucheng's patient persuasion. (Draft)

    (18) Under such a serious attitude, we decided to conduct a two-pronged battle against ice jams. (Textbook)

    (19) Although their work is also very busy, they still try their best to help him in the spirit of mutual aid and noble class friendship. (Periodical)

    (20) Under Chiang Kai-shek's policy of selling out national interests, the American imperialists are still cruelly engaged in economic plunder, exploiting the blood and sweat of the Chinese people. (Newspaper)

    (16) can be changed to "due to". (17) can be changed to "after". ("Historically" should be changed to "never".) (18) can be changed to "holding". (19) can be changed to "based on...spirit, developing...friendship". (20) can be changed to "using". The "zai" and "xia" in the following sentences can be removed, and some sentences need to change their organization.

    (21) Therefore, the people of all China, under unbearable circumstances, launched a vigorous patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea to defend their homes and country. (Newspaper)

    (22) Under the condition of no electric lights at night, they did not forget to lead employees to conduct political studies. (Periodical)

    (23) When this play was performed for the first time, it stopped before it could be finished under the circumstances of everyone being unable to suppress their sadness and tears. (Periodical)

    (24) Labor hero Rong Xize carries 8.9 cubic meters of soil every day under the condition of being 70 meters away from the earth yard. (Newspaper)

    (25) Under the circumstances of our taking over more than 15,000 accumulated cases of the puppet land administration bureau and more than 8,000 new registration cases, reviewing, sorting, and announcing them in order, we have repeatedly taken care of unemployed comrades in advance according to special circumstances. (Letter)

    The first three sentences can be completed by simply removing "zai" and "xia", "de tiaojian xia", "de qingkuang xia". (24) can be changed to "carrying 8.9 cubic meters of soil every day from the earth yard 70 meters away". (25) can be changed to "We took over..., and received new..., reviewed, sorted, and announced in order, which could not be rushed, but already according to..."

    Some people may doubt: In this way, "zai...xia" is completely useless? Definitely not. There are still many examples where "zai...xia" should be used and can only be used. Due to space constraints, only a few examples can be given:

    (26) Under this situation, many people asked for a summary explanation. (Mao Zedong)

    (27) This shameful American proposal passed by the United Nations Anglo-American majority group under the orders of the American ruling group has no legal effect. (Newspaper)

    (28) Let us realize at all times that we are running the publication under the help and supervision of the broad masses of readers. (Periodical)

    The "zai...xia" in the following two sentences is also correct, but the problem lies elsewhere:

    (29) Under the condition of not affecting production work, teachers are allowed to have time to prepare courses. (Newspaper)

    (30) The six million names signed on the Stockholm Declaration under the suppression of MacArthur and the Yoshida government are powerful proof. (Periodical)

    (29) "Qingkuang" should be "tiaojian" (there are many similar examples). (30) should add a few words: "Although under... the suppression, there were still six million people who signed...", otherwise it becomes absurd that the signature was due to the suppression of MacArthur and the Yoshida government.

    Finally, here are two examples of misusing and overusing "zai...xia":

    (31) These forty-two people's warriors, under the cultivation and education of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, under the care and love of the superiors, and under the boiling welcome of the masses, finally returned in triumph, full of honor, holding high the banner of victory. (Newspaper)

    (32) In the two stages of typical experimentation and partial deployment of the land reform in southern Jiangsu, due to the masses not being prepared, the lack of leadership experience, and the objective situation not being familiar enough, all localities emphasized the principle of "prudence and steady progress" according to the instructions of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. (Periodical)

    (31) Three "zai...xia" are used in succession. The first two phrases may be understandable in themselves, but they are not very related in meaning to the main verb "return". The third phrase is more appropriate, but it is not as good as saying "in...welcome". (32) The more appropriate word "yin (因 - because)" is clearly already used, but the phrase "de qingkuang xia" is still forcibly added, which shows the great temptation of this format. If it continues to be misused and overused in this way, I am afraid that this useful format of "zai...xia" will become meaningless.

    Cong...zhong, cong...shang (从……中，从……上 - from...middle, from...above). There is not much chance of making mistakes by using "cong (从 - from)" alone. What needs attention is when it is used with "zhong" or "shang". Of the following four sentences using "cong...zhong", one is used correctly, and three are used inappropriately.

    (33) Who liberated me from a life of slavery? Who saved me from illness? (Newspaper)

    (34) Two model communist party members sacrificed themselves from a rockslide accident in the open air. (Book)

    (35) Unite the broad masses with workers and peasants as the main body, carry out military, political, economic, and cultural struggles against the enemy, and gradually gain victory from these struggles. (Newspaper)

    (36) It is proven from more than a year of experience that this is the best way to conduct propaganda and education for the masses. (Periodical)

    (34) and (35) should use "zai...zhong". (36) Remove "cong...zhong" and use "experience" as the subject, or say "it can be seen from more than a year of experience".

    Of the following four sentences using "cong...shang", one is used correctly, and three are used inappropriately.

    (37) We must learn to look at problems from their essence.

    (38) Later, the trade union introduced her to a study class in Shanghai, so that she could improve her thinking more quickly from the ideological aspect. (Periodical)

    (39) Live frugally and donate generously to support the front line from a material perspective. (Periodical)

    (40) The new women of new China are praised from an artistic image perspective. (Periodical)

    (38) and (39) should use "zai...shang". (In example 38, "Shangzong (上总)" is the "Shanghai General Trade Union", and in example 39, the word "lai (来 - come)" is superfluous.) (40) The "cong...shang" should be changed to "yong (用 - use)" or "tongguo (通过 - through)".

    Usage of the word "dang (当 - when, at the time of)". The word "dang" is used to indicate that the time of two events is equivalent. In spoken language, "de shihou (的时候 - when)" is usually used, for example, "wo lai de shihou, ta de bing hai mei hao (我来的时候，他的病还没好 - when I came, his illness had not yet recovered)". If this phrase is not at the beginning of the sentence, add the word "zai," for example, "ren zai sheng bing de shihou, jiu hui xiang jia (人在生病的时候，就会想家 - when people are sick, they will miss home)". In writing, in addition to the word "zai", the word "dang" is often used, and it is often used at the beginning of the sentence; "dang zhe (当着 - in the presence of)" is also used, but less often. This is mostly because the phrase is quite long, so using "zai" or "dang" at the beginning draws the reader's attention. This is good. But be careful: the word "dang" must be matched with "de shihou" below, and it cannot be used alone like the following sentence.

    (41) When the like of Truman are talking about the "peace treaty" with Japan, they mean openly and massively arming Japan. (Periodical)

    If "de shihou" cannot be used below, then "dang" cannot be used above. For example:

    (42) As soon as the early rice is harvested, she hurriedly harrows the land to plant wheat. (Periodical)

    "Yi (一 - as soon as)..., jiu (就 - then)..." This format indicates two events that occur one after the other, so it is customary not to use "de shihou", and of course, "dang" cannot be used in front. This does not mean that "dang" can be used above if there is "de shihou" below. For example:

    (43) When she was sixteen years old, she went to Shanghai from the countryside. (Periodical)

    This "dang" is superfluous, not only because this phrase is very short and does not need to draw attention, but also because with the word "dang", the word "she" is held back in this phrase, and when reading "went to Shanghai from the countryside", it feels like there is a lack of a subject in front. Furthermore, not only is the word "dang" superfluous, but "de shihou" is also superfluous. "She went to Shanghai from the countryside at the age of sixteen." It is very clean.

    As mentioned above, "dang" means equivalent, so you can only say "dang...de shihou", but you cannot say "dang...zhi qian (当……之前 - before)" or "dang...zhi hou (当……之后 - after)", just as we can say "dang men (当门 - right in front of the door)", but we cannot say "dang men li (当门里 - inside the door)" or "dang men wai (当门外 - outside the door)". Some people mistakenly believe that the word "dang" is completely equal to the word "zai," so such sentences appear:

    (44) Before the land reform is about to be realized, we will never allow bad people to sabotage it from within. (Newspaper)

    (45) But when she heard the news that more than a dozen people, including Party Secretary Shi Dehui, were arrested by the reactionaries and held in dark caves, she resolutely and bravely went to rescue them together with the militia. (Newspaper)

    These two sentences cannot be simply replaced with the word "zai" for the word "dang". (44) "Zai tu gai jiu yao shi xian zhi qian" is also rather roundabout, it is better to say "Now land reform is about to begin". (45) Not only is the word "dang" inappropriate, but the "yi (一 - as soon as)..." format is used, and it is customary not to say "zhi hou" again. Not only that, but even "de xiaoxi (的消息 - the news)" is superfluous, and two "she (她 - she)" can also be removed.

                                        (End of this section, entire article not finished)

　　语法、修辞讲话（第三讲）
    吕叔湘　朱德熙
    第七段  在、从、当
    在于。  所有的动词里头，恐怕除了“是”字就得数“在”字出现的次数最多了。“在”字的最常见的用法是跟“里”“中”“上”“下”这些方位词配合起来用，相当于欧洲语言里的某一些介词。这在下面分几节说明，现在先谈一谈“在于”，这是只当主要动词用的。
    “在于”的主语很有限制，最常见的是“目的”“关键”“问题”“重要性”这些，其次是“原因”“优点”“缺点”等等（这些的底下用“是”比“在于”更普通）。不用这些名词而用一个短语或句子形式，除了“来与不来在于你”这种习惯性的说法外，一般是不许可的。例如：
    （一）把一种或多种事物作为对象，细心地加以解剖或分析，抽绎或提炼，归纳或综合等等，主要地是在阐明对象的实质、属性、关系或其发展。（教）
    （二）一个人在年青时的可塑性最大，一个人要成为什么，主要就在年青时的教育。（教）
    （三）展览之所以受欢迎，是在于它用具体的实物和生动的图画说明了问题。（期）（一）用“在”代表“目的在于”，（二）用“在”代表“关键在于”，都是不妥当的。（三）的“在于”不及“因为”明确。
    在……中。用“在……中”表示空间和时间，极其普通，也不大会用错。这里说的是几种引申的用法。在底下这些例句里，读者不难辨别哪几句是对的，哪几句是错的：
    （四）在这四个阶级中，居于领导地位的是工人阶级。
    （五）在我校二十三个教研组中，大体上可分为三种类型。（报）
    （六）让他们在劳动中改造自己，成为新人。（毛）
    （七）革命的大时代给我们显示了生活的海洋，毛主席的文艺思想武装了我们的头脑，在艰苦的抗战中和解放战争中也更加紧了我们与群众的联系。（教）
    （八）这个案件还在调查研究中，暂时不能宣布。
    （九）我们可以说，现在美国的文化是在停止发展中。（报）（四）（六）（八）是对的。（五）取消“在”和“中”，或是把“可分为”改做“有”。（七）取消“在”和“中”，否则“加紧”没有主语。（九）“在……中”只能表示进行的行为，不能用于“停止”，应该改做“已经”。
    在……上。  要注意的也是引申用法，例如：
    （十）孙中山……在怎样和帝国主义作斗争的问题上，隙和我们达到了这样一个基本上一致的结论。（毛）这个“在……上”也是常常会用错的。例如：
    （十一）虽然他也负责剪出不少资料，但在工作态度上是没有端正过来。（期）
    （十二）在师资上，两千多同学的体育正课，只有四个教员。（期）
    （十三）在土地改革和妇女解放关系的问题上，省委指示中说……。（期）
    （十四）这个副业生产，在目前支持群众渡荒上，是最好的办法。（稿）
    （十五）他们在看问题的方法上，是仅看到某些工人的暂时现象和缺点，而没看到工人的本质和优点。（书）（十一）的“在”和“上”应该去掉，否则这个分句没有主语。（“是”字也不需要。）（十二）应该是“在……方面”。（十三）不如说关于土地改革和妇女解放的关系”。（十四）应该说“是帮助群众渡过目前饥荒的最好的办法”。（十五）第一步去掉“在”和“上”，让“方法”做“是”的主语，但是这句话还是不很通顺，应改为“他们看问题的方法是错误的，他们仅仅看到……”。
    在……（之）下。  在现代的文章里，“在……（之）下”用得比“在……中”或“在……上”都更加广泛。就形式说，嵌在中间的有名词，最普通的是“情况”和“条件”，其次有“原则”“政策”“精神”“态度”等等。这些名词前面常有或长或短的附加语，说明是哪种情况、条件、原则等等。有由动词转变过来的名词，如“领导”“指导”“支配”“监督”“爱护”“帮助”“努力”“参加”“保证”“培养”“教育”“说服”“镇压”“迫害”，多得很。（其中有许多还只能算是主谓短语的谓语动词，还没完全变成名词。）其次，还有短语或句子形式，例如“忍无可忍”“无计可施”“两昼夜喝不到水”等等。“在忍无可忍之下”这种说法显然是不对的，可是只要在这里头加上“的情况”，就符合于第一种格式了。可见评论“在……下”用得对不对，不能单从形式着眼。
    从意义方面来看，也不很容易判别。“在………下”到底代表怎么样的一种概念呢？“在某种条件之下”是以某事为条件，是一种限制。“在某种情况之下”是说在这种情况之下只能有或自然会有某种事情，也有限制之意，可是同时也带着点因果关系。但在用“原则”“政策”“精神”“态度”的时候就很难说有限制之意。“在某某的领导之下”可以照字面讲做在某某的领导的底下，“支配”“监督”等也是如此，可是“努力”“参加”等等又不能这样讲。可见“在……下”的涵义不但是多种多样，而且很广泛，很不容易捉摸。
    也许我们该从反面来看，看某一句里是不是能用别的词语把意思表达得比“在……下”明确些。这个时候就会发现，不能执定说“在……下”的中间用哪两个字的必定行，用哪两个字的必定不行。同样的“在……情况之下”，也许这句里行，那句里不行。一切要看具体情况。底下这些句子里的“在……下”是能用别的词语来替代而意思更明确的。
    （十六）自一、二月先后开工以来，在卫生工程局及参加工作的工人、部队不顾劳累、寒冷地积极工作下，工程进行很快………。（报）
    （十七）历史上就不大劳动的贾三流，在高苟成的耐心说服下，参加了互助组。（稿）
    （十八）在这样的严肃态度下，我们决定对凌汛进行两方面的战斗。（课）
    （十九）虽然他们的工作也很忙，但在互助的精神和高贵的阶级友爱下，还是尽力的给他以协助。（期）
    （二十）美帝国主义者在蒋介石出卖民族利益的政策下，还残酷地从事经济的搜刮，榨取中国人民的血汗。（报）（十六）可以改用“由于”。（十七）可以改用“经过”。（“历史上”应该改做“从来”。）（十八）可以改用“抱着”。（十九）可以改做“本着………精神，发挥………友爱”。（二十）可以改做“利用”。底下这些句子里的“在”和“下”可以取消，一部分句子要改变组织。
    （二一）于是，全中国的人民在忍无可忍下掀起了轰轰烈烈抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动。（报）
    （二二）在晚上没有电灯的条件下，也没忘记领导员工进行政治学习。（期）
    （二三）当这个戏第一次演出时，在大家抑止不住的伤心流泪的情况下，没有能够演完就停止了。（期）
    （二四）劳动英雄戎西则，在距离土场七十公尺的情况下，每天挑土八点九公方。（报）
    （二五）在我们接管一万五千多起伪地政局积压案件和新收八千多起登记案件，依次审查整理公告的情况下，已按特殊情形一再提前照顾了失业同志。（信）前三句只要把“在”和“下”“的条件下”“的情况下”取消就完了。（二四）改做“从七十公尺外的土场挑土，每天挑八点九公方”。（二五）改做“我们接管………，又新收………，依次审查、整理、公告，不能速了，但是已按………”。
    会有人怀疑：这样看来，“在……下”全无用处了？决不是如此。应该用“在……下”、只能用“在……下”的例子还是很多的。在篇幅的限制之下，只能少举几个：
    （二六）在这种情形下，很多人要求做个总结性的解释。（毛）
    （二七）联合国美英多数集团在美国统治集团的命令下所通过的这个可耻的美国提案，没有法律上的效力。（报）
    （二八）让我们时时刻刻体会到，我们是在广大读者的帮助和监督下办刊物。（期）底下这两句的“在……下”也是对的，毛病在别的地方：
    （二九）在不影响生产工作的情况下，允许教员有进行预备课程的时间。（报）
    （三十）在麦克阿瑟与吉田政府镇压之下签字在斯德哥尔摩宣言上的六百万姓名，就是极有力的证明。（期）（二九）的“情况”应该是“条件”（同类的例子不少）。（三十）应该添几个字：“虽然在……之下，签字………还是有六百万人”，否则就变了签名是出于麦克阿瑟和吉田政府的镇压，那就荒谬透顶了。
    最后，举两个乱用和滥用“在………下”的例子：
    （三一）这四十二位人民战士在共产党与人民解放军的培养教育下，在上级的关怀与爱护之下，在群众沸腾的欢迎之下，终于载满了荣誉，高举着胜利的旗帜凯旋归来。（报）
    （三二）苏南土地改革在典型试验和局部展开两个阶段中，因群众尚无准备，领导经验不足，客观情况尚不够熟悉的情况下，各地都根据中共中央华东局的指示，强调“谨慎小心，稳步前进”的方针。（期）（三一）叠用三个“在……下”，头两个短语也许本身讲得通，但是跟这里的主要动词“归来”在意义上不大能连系，比较贴切的是第三个短语，但是又不如说“在……欢迎声中”。（三二）明明已经用了较为恰当的“因”字，可是还要硬安上个“的情况下”，可见这个格式的诱惑力之大。要照这样滥用乱用下去，恐怕“在………下”这个有用的格式会变成毫无意义的东西。
    从……中、从……上。  “从”字单用不大会错，要注意的是跟“中”或“上”配合的时候。底下这四句的“从……中”，一句用对了，三句用的不恰当。
    （三三）是谁从奴役的生活中解放了我？是谁从疾病中救活了我？（报）
    （三四）从露天崩岩事故中，两个模范共产党员牺牲了。（书）
    （三五）团结了以工农为主体的广大群众，向敌人作军事的、政治的、经济的、文化的斗争，并从这些斗争中逐渐获得胜利。（报）
    （三六）从年余的经验中证明：这是对群众进行宣传教育的最好的方式。（期）（三四）和（三五）应该用“在……中”。（三六）取消“从……中”，用“经验”做主语，或是说“从年余的经验中看出”。
    底下这四句的“从……上”，也是一句用对了，三句用的不恰当。
    （三七）我们要学会从本质上看问题。
    （三八）后来工会又介绍她到上总学习班去学习，使她更快的从思想上提高一步。（期）
    （三九）节衣缩食，慷慨捐献，从物质上来支援前线。（期）
    （四十）从艺术形象上表扬了新中国的新妇女。（期）（三八）和（三九）应该用“在………上”。（三八例的“上总”是“上海总工会”，三九例的“来”字多余。）（四十）的“从………上”应该改做“用”或“通过”。
    “当”字的用法。  “当”字用来表示两件事情的时间相当。在口语里，通常只用“………的时候”，例如“我来的时候，他的病还没好”。假如这个短语不在句子的头上，就加个“在”字，例如“人在生病的时候，就会想家”。在文章里，除了“在”字，又常用“当”字，并且常常用在句子的头上；还有用“当着”的，比较少。这多半是因为这个短语相当长，所以在头上用“在”或“当”提起读者的注意。这是好的。可是要留神：“当”字下面必得有“的时候”跟它配合，不能像底下这句光用个“当”字了事。
    （四一）当杜鲁门之流在高谈对日“和约”，他们是指公开的大举武装日本。（期）假如底下不能用“的时候”，上面也就不能用“当”。例如：
    （四二）当早稻一收割，她就赶忙耙地种小麦。（期）“一”怎么样，“就”怎么样，这个格式表示的是一先一后的两件事，所以习惯上不用“的时候”，当然前面也就不能用“当”。这不是说，下面有了“的时候”，上面就一定可以用“当”。例如：
    （四三）当她十六岁的时候，就从乡下到了上海。（期）这个“当”字就是多余的，不但是因为这个短语很短，没有提起注意的需要，并且因为有了“当”字，“她”字就扣留在这个短语里头，念起来就觉得“从乡下到了上海”前头缺少个主语。更进一步，不但“当”字是多余的，“的时候”也是多余的。“她十六岁就从乡下到了上海。”挺干净。
    上面说过，“当”是相当的意思，所以只能说“当……的时候”，不能说“当……之前”或“当……之后”，正如我们可以说“当门”，但是不能说“当门里”或“当门外”。有人误会“当”字完全等于“在”字，于是就有这种句子出现：
    （四四）当土改就要实现之前，我们绝不容许坏人从中破坏。（报）
    （四五）可是当她一听到支书石德辉等十几人被反动派抓住关在暗窟里的消息之后，她就坚决英勇的和民兵一道去营救他们。（报）这两句还不是简单地用“在”字代“当”字可了。（四四）“在土改就要实现之前”也还嫌绕口，不如说“现在土改就要开始”。（四五）不但“当”字不妥，并且用了“一……”的格式，习惯上也不再说“之后”。不但这样，连“的消息”也是多余的，两个“她”字也大可取消一个。
