　　Suggestions for Filming "Song Jing Shi and Wu Xun" and Drawing Comic Strips
    Editor:
    After reading "Song Jing Shi, a Local Peasant Revolutionary Leader Contemporary with Wu Xun" published in your newspaper on July 24th, I have a clearer understanding of revolution and counter-revolution. Therefore, I suggest that the Film Bureau, using "Song Jing Shi and Wu Xun" as the title, widely solicit film scripts and select the best to be made into a film. I believe that this peasant revolutionary historical event will have a great educational effect on the cultural and educational circles and the broad masses. The reasons why peasant revolutions in Chinese history could not succeed, and why the revolution must be led by the working class vanguard, the Communist Party, can also be analyzed from this historical fact.
          Chahar Province Agricultural Experiment Farm, Tang Lizhi Editor:
    We are primary school educators. In the past, influenced by feudal rulers and many other incorrect propagandas, we admired Wu Xun. After recently studying the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun," we have come to realize Wu Xun's true colors. Especially after reading "An Investigative Account of Wu Xun's History," our understanding of Wu Xun is even more thorough. We suggest that "An Investigative Account of Wu Xun's History" be compiled into comic strips to eliminate the poisoning of the masses by Wu Xun's movies, novels, and drawings.

### 建议拍摄《宋景诗和武训》影片和绘制连环画

　　建议拍摄《宋景诗和武训》影片和绘制连环画
    编辑同志：
    读了贵报七月二十四日登载的“和武训同时的当地农民革命领袖宋景诗”以后，在我的思想中对革命与反革命有了更明确的认识。因此我建议电影局以《宋景诗和武训》为题，广泛地征求电影剧本，选最优秀的摄成电影。我相信这个农民革命史迹，对文化教育界和广大群众，都是有很大的教育作用的。中国历史上的农民革命为什么不能成功，为什么革命一定要工人阶级的先锋队共产党来领导，也可以从这个史实上来分析。
          察哈尔省农业试验场  汤礼治编辑同志：
    我们是小学教育工作者，过去因为受了封建统治者和其他许多不正确的宣传的影响，曾崇拜过武训。经过最近批判《武训传》的学习，才认识了武训的本来面目。尤其是读了《武训历史调查记》以后，对武训的认识更彻底了。我们建议将《武训历史调查记》编成连环图画，来清除有关武训电影、小说图画等对群众的毒害。
