　　Leader Images Should Not Be Abused!
　(1) Editor:
　　In Wangfujing Street, Beijing, some stall vendors are selling notebooks called "Learning Manuals." The cover of these notebooks is printed with an image of Chairman Mao; however, both the drawing and printing are crude. I believe this situation is very bad. Chairman Mao is the beloved revolutionary leader of the entire Chinese people and the people of the world. Drawing and printing images of Chairman Mao is a serious task. We should correctly depict Chairman Mao's image and great spirit. The aforementioned crude production of leader images shows disrespect to the leader and should be corrected immediately. Therefore, I suggest that relevant authorities establish specific measures to prohibit this kind of inferior behavior of casually drawing and printing Chairman Mao's image as advertising to solicit business.

　　Recently, I saw some letters sent to Soviet friends from various places, and found that some envelopes sent from Tianjin and Nanjing, etc., had images of Chinese and foreign leaders such as Stalin, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, as well as some slogans, printed in the upper left corner. The depiction and printing of the leader images on these envelopes are very rough and cannot express the great spirit of the leaders at all. I think this is very bad. Printing leader images is an extremely serious political task, and we should adopt a respectful, loving, and careful attitude. I suggest that the relevant authorities manage the work of printing leader images and correct the bad practice of crude production.

　　Recently, I saw many people in Dezhou City, Shandong Province, wearing badges with Chairman Mao's image, which shows their respect and love for the leader. However, some leader image badges sold in stores are very crudely made. If the words "People's Leader Chairman Mao" were not written on them, it would be difficult to recognize the image as Chairman Mao. According to my understanding, many of these crudely made leader badges appearing in Dezhou City are produced by the Beijing Huakang Medal Factory. I believe that this behavior of crudely making leader badges is a sign of disrespect to the leader and should be banned immediately. I suggest that the relevant authorities review the leader image badges manufactured by various badge factories; those that do not meet the standards should be immediately prohibited from manufacturing and selling them.

### 不能容许滥制领袖像！

　　不能容许滥制领袖像！
  （一）编辑同志：
    北京王府井大街有一些小摊贩出卖一种叫做“学习手册”的笔记本。这种笔记本的封面上印着毛主席像；但绘画和印刷都是粗制滥造的。我认为这种情况是非常不好的。毛主席是全中国人民以及全世界人民所热爱的革命领袖。绘制及印刷毛主席像是一种严肃的工作。我们应该正确地画出毛主席的形象和伟大的气魄来。上述这种粗制滥造领袖像的做法表现了对领袖的不尊敬，应该即予纠正。因此，我建议有关机关订出具体办法，禁止这种随便绘印毛主席像作为兜揽生意广告的恶劣行为。

  （二）编辑同志：
    最近我看到各地寄给苏联朋友们的一些信件，发现在天津和南京等地寄来的信件中，有些信封的左上角上印有斯大林、毛主席、朱总司令等中外领袖像和一些标语。这些信封上的领袖像的描绘和印刷都是很粗糙的，丝毫不能表达出领袖们的伟大气魄。我认为这是非常不好的。印制领袖像是一件极其严肃的政治工作，应该采取尊敬热爱和细心负责的态度。我建议有关机关对印制领袖像的工作加以管理，纠正粗制滥造的不良做法。

  （三）编辑同志：
    最近我在山东德州市看到很多人戴着有毛主席像的徽章，这表现了他们对领袖的尊敬和热爱。但是，有些商店出售的领袖像徽章，制造得很粗糙，如果上面不写着“人民领袖毛主席”的字样，就很难认识上面的像是毛主席像。据我了解，在德州市出现的这种粗制滥造的领袖章，很多是北京华康奖章工厂的出品。我认为，这种粗制滥造领袖章的行为是不尊重领袖的表现，应该马上取缔。我建议有关机关对各徽章工厂所制造的领袖像徽章进行审查；对不合规格的，应即禁止其制造和出售。
