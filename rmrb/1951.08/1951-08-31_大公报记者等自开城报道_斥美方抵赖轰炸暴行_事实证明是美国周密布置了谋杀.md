*Ta Kung Pao* Reporters and Others Report from Kaesong
Denouncing the US Side's Denial of Bombing Atrocities
Facts Prove that the US Meticulously Orchestrated the Murder
[Xinhua News Agency, 28th] Shanghai's *Ta Kung Pao* and Tianjin's *Progress Daily* today published a joint commentary from their reporters in Kaesong on the 26th, refuting the US side's lies of feigning innocence and denying the US aircraft bombing of the Kaesong incident. The commentary pointed out: After the bombing incident, Tokyo, based on the fabricated report of their liaison officer, falsely accused that the entire atrocity was fabricated or bombed by the Communist aircraft themselves. The enemy has been shouting about "air and sea superiority," with aircraft controlling the entire Korea. This time, they said our aircraft came to Kaesong to drop bombs. The Kaesong neutral zone has a radius of only five miles, and the enemy area is to the south. Our aircraft came, but the enemy didn't know, didn't intercept, and didn't pursue. Where did the so-called "superiority" go? Why is it "superiority" day and night, but there was no "superiority" that night? This is the first point. Second: Several killing bombs were no more than 200 meters away from our delegation's residence. This difference of 200 meters, in terms of the time difference for aircraft bombing, is probably less than one-tenth of a second. In this way, we really wanted to kill our own delegation? Otherwise, it would be impossible to take such an absurd and intolerable risk. The enemy's shameless slander is self-defeating.

Truman also followed suit and denied that there were any of their aircraft over Kaesong at that time. Does he not know that their aircraft are flying day and night over the Kaesong neutral zone? Or is he saying that there were no their aircraft only when the atrocity occurred? Too coincidental! If this Mr. President uses this layout to write detective novels, I'm afraid it will be difficult to sell even one.

The above shows that from Washington to Tokyo, to Korea, the US imperialist war-mongers, from Truman to Ridgway, to Joy, meticulously orchestrated this atrocity to deliberately disrupt the Korean armistice negotiations; it further shows that US imperialism does not want peace, but wants to continue aggression against the Chinese and Korean people. The commentary concludes by pointing out: We must redouble our efforts to launch the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country movement to meet this more arduous struggle and resolutely resist US imperialist aggression.

　　大公报记者等自开城报道
    斥美方抵赖轰炸暴行
    事实证明是美国周密布置了谋杀
    【新华社二十八日讯】上海大公报与天津进步日报今日发表该两报记者二十六日自开城联合发来的述评，驳斥美方含血喷人，抵赖美机轰炸开城事件的谎话。述评指出：轰炸事件发生后，东京就根据他们联络官的虚构报告，诬赖说：整个暴行是捏造的，或者是共产党飞机自己炸的。敌人一直在狂叫“海空优势”，飞机控制整个朝鲜。这回子，却说我们的飞机到开城投弹。开城中立区半径不过五英里，南面就是敌区，我机来临敌人竟然不知道、不阻击、不追击，所谓“优势”那里去了？为什么日日夜夜都是“优势”，偏偏那晚上就没有“优势”呢？这是第一点。第二：杀伤弹多枚离我代表团住所不过二百公尺。这二百公尺之差，在飞机投弹时间上的差别，恐怕不到十分之一秒。如此，我们真想杀害自己的代表团？否则，决不可能去冒这样荒唐而且不容冒的危险。敌人的无耻诬蔑，不攻自破。
    杜鲁门也跟着否认说：开城上空那时根本没有他们的飞机。还是他根本不知道在开城中立区上空，他们的飞机日夜在飞行呢？还是说就只在暴行发生时没有他们的飞机？太巧了！这位总统先生如果以此布局来写侦探小说，恐怕一本都难卖掉。
    以上说明了从华盛顿到东京，到朝鲜，美帝国主义的战争贩子从杜鲁门到李奇微，到乔埃，上下一手地很周密地布置了这个暴行，来故意破坏朝鲜停战谈判；更说明了美帝国主义决不要和平，而是要继续对中、朝人民进行侵略。述评最后指出：我们必须加倍努力地展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动，来迎接这更艰巨的斗争，坚决地抵抗美帝国主义的侵略。
