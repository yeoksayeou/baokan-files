What We Learned From Discussing the Wu Xun Problem
       Qian Junrui
            I. An "Assessment" That Cannot Be Overturned
    What kind of person was Wu Xun exactly? This question, after more than three months of discussion, especially after the publication of "Wu Xun's Historical Investigation," has been thoroughly resolved:
    First, Wu Xun was a ruthless rogue, big usurer, and big landlord who came from a poor peasant family, turned his back on the working people, used "begging" as a means, used "promoting education" as a guise, colluded with local tyrants and bullies, was granted special privileges by the reactionary Qing government, opposed the peasant revolution at the time, and loyally served the entire landlord class and the reactionary government.
    Second, Wu Xun was not a bourgeois or petty-bourgeois reformist. Judging from his class status (big landlord, big usurer) and all his actions (including "promoting education")’s purposes and effects, he was a thoroughgoing feudal reactionary. It is incorrect to regard Wu Xun as a reformist. In fact, Wu Xun was the most loyal and docile lackey who implemented Empress Dowager Cixi's counter-revolutionary line.
    Third, of course, he was even less the so-called "great model of the working people," "pioneer of the oppressed and exploited working people," as some fanatical Wu Xun eulogists have proclaimed. All of Wu Xun's so-called "asceticism" after turning his back on the working people was nothing more than a clever disguise and a vicious means to become a bigger landlord and usurer, and to serve the feudal class more effectively.
    During the discussion of the Wu Xun problem, many people raised the following questions regarding the evaluation of Wu Xun's person and deeds:
    First, the question of motive and effect.
    "Although the result of Wu Xun's promoting education only served the feudal landlord class, his motive for promoting education was good." This is a view that separates motive from effect. Chairman Mao said, "Idealists emphasize motive and deny effect, while mechanical materialists emphasize effect and deny motive. We are the opposite of both of these; we are dialectical materialists who see the unity of motive and effect." ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art") A motive for serving the masses and an effect welcomed by the masses are inextricably linked; similarly, a motive for serving individuals and the reactionary ruling class and an effect unfavorable to the people are also inextricably linked. Wu Xun's motive for "promoting education" cannot be judged separately from the effect of his "promoting education." We once insisted on this point of view, while many people doubted this point of view. The historical investigation of Wu Xun thoroughly solved this problem. What exactly was Wu Xun's motive?
    Contrary to the propaganda of Wu Xun's apologists, according to "Wu Xun's Historical Investigation," Wu Xun's "determination to promote education" was due to his unwillingness to continue "doing hard labor," his falling out with his mother and brother, and his leaving the poor peasant family, after which he "became a big beggar," and not, as commonly rumored, that he first resolved to "promote education" and then went to beg. In order to obtain more money and the appreciation of the landlord class, he put up the signboard of "promoting education" to "beg." This is Wu Xun's true motive for initially wanting to "promote education."
    The facts have proved that Wu Xun did not really strive for "promoting education"; all he strove for was buying land and lending money, and even when there were people like Guo Fen who were willing to offer land to help him run a school, he firmly refused. It was not until he had been begging for thirty years, owning nearly three *qing* of land, and accumulating 7,000 *diao* of cash in Tangyi alone, that is, when he had become a big landlord and big usurer, that he established his first free school on the orders of the local tyrant and bully Yang Shufang, for the benefit of the landlord class, not for the benefit of the peasants.
    Therefore, the kind of idealistic analysis that believes that Wu Xun's motive for running a school was good, and attempts to deny even the reactionary nature of Wu Xun's running a school, is wrong.
    Second, the question of moral standards.
    Wu Xun's eulogists desperately publicize Wu Xun's "asceticism," his "integrity," his "thirty years as one day, perseverance, overcoming difficulties" spirit. Someone then asked, "What is wrong with using Wu Xun's spirit to serve the people?" "Besides, we now have the correct leadership of the Party, and basically the revolution will not go down the road of reformism. Under such historical conditions, what danger is there in learning from Wu Xun's spirit?" (Qin Shouwen, "Is Wu Xun's Spirit Really Not Worth Learning?" Nanjing Xinhua Daily, June 10).
    This raises the question of moral standards, that is, the question of what should be the measure for judging a person's behavior.
    For a century, Wu Xun's "morality" has been favored and praised by the reactionary Qing dynasty, the Northern Warlords, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and Japanese imperialism. What was the reason for this? In the same century, how many patriotic and revolutionary people of lofty ideals, how many workers and peasants were insulted and slaughtered by imperialists, the reactionary Qing dynasty, the Northern Warlords, and the Kuomintang reactionaries in our motherland. What was the reason for this? Is this stark contrast not enough to show that Wu Xun's rogue-like "asceticism" and utter servility are precisely the "morality" that best suits the interests of the reactionary ruling class, and precisely the very effective and vicious spiritual weapon of the internal and external reactionaries in modern China?
    Specifically, what morality does Wu Xun have that can be emulated by today's people? Wu Xun "begged," is "begging" a kind of morality? Can we advocate that people beg? His eating snakes and scorpions, eating tiles, eating feces and urine, crawling down to pretend to be livestock for people to ride, imitating donkey and dog barks, etc., were all his means of acting crazy and stupid, and deceiving and blackmailing people. His purpose was nothing more than to get the working people to give him more money, or to force people to repay his debts. Are these also "morals" that we can advocate that people practice? "Wu Xun's Historical Investigation" tells us with irrefutable evidence that, contrary to the propaganda of Wu Xun's eulogists, not a single bit of "filial piety" and "friendship" can be found in Wu Xun. He was neither filial nor friendly, and was a ruthless and unrighteous person. It is also false to say that Wu Xun "did not like fame" and "opposed erecting memorial archways." Didn't Wu Xun have people carry the plaque of "Benevolent and Generous" "parading on the streets of Liulin Town for several days"? Wu Xun's eulogists even want to vigorously promote Wu Xun's "not marrying a wife," as if celibacy and abstinence should become our national morality. Who knew that they would also fail in this respect, as Wu Xun relied on his rogue methods to arrange many marriages for others and also became many "godmothers". As for Wu Xun kowtowing and kneeling to people, which is considered a kind of morality even by those who eulogize Wu Xun, and even compared to Lu Xun's spirit of "willingly serving the children like an ox," that is truly the greatest insult to the Chinese people and Lu Xun! Wu Xun kowtowing and kneeling to the sons of landlords, gentry, and landlord merchants, and not daring to eat with them, is precisely the manifestation of the most despicable and shameful qualities of a feudal slave. Whoever still promotes this kind of "morality" today is advocating slavish thought to facilitate the restoration of internal and external reactionaries in China. We will never allow this kind of slavish spirit to reappear in New China. The Chinese people who have already stood up are the masters of the great motherland. We must never be obsequious to anyone. What we want to inherit and promote are the noble qualities inherent in the Chinese people, such as diligence, bravery, loyalty, honesty, and solidarity and friendship towards the working people. What we want to cultivate and improve are the national moralities stipulated in the Common Program, such as love for the motherland, love for the people, love for labor, love for science, and protection of public property. This is the moral standard of the people of New China. As for the "spirit of Wu Xun," all Chinese people should throw it into the latrine.
    Third, the question of so-called across-the-board negation:
    One view holds that: "Wu Xun is a historical figure, and we cannot be too demanding of him. We should analyze and criticize him from a historical and materialist point of view and give him an appropriate evaluation. Therefore, it is wrong to say that today's eulogists and promoters of Wu Xun are wrong, and it is even more wrong to worship the spirit of Wu Xun. However, it is also wrong to completely negate everything about Wu Xun and describe him as a historical sinner without any reservation." ("Can the Spirit of Wu Xun Be Negated Across the Board?" Wanbei Daily, June 17, 1951.)
    What attitude should we take when analyzing and evaluating a historical figure? We should take a historical materialist attitude, that is, we should specifically analyze the characteristics of the historical environment at the time and place, and in a class society, we should mainly analyze the opposition and comparison of classes at that time, and at the same time analyze the relationship between a specific historical figure and each of those classes, and the role they played in the social productive forces at the time and the comparison of class forces at the time. To study the Wu Xun problem with this attitude is also like what the "People's Daily" editorial said, we must "study what new social economic forms, new class forces, new figures, and new ideas have emerged in China in the more than one hundred years since the Opium War of 1840, which have struggled against the old social economic forms and their superstructure (politics, culture, etc.), and decide what things should be praised or eulogized, what things should not be praised or eulogized, and what things should be opposed".
    Under the historical conditions at the time, which class did Wu Xun establish close ties with? Was it with the landlord class and the reactionary Qing dynasty, or with the working peasants and their leader Song Jingshi and others? Obviously, he was connected with the former, not with the latter. Obviously, he was a direct exploiter of the working peasants and an accomplice of Yang Shufang, a reactionary leader who suppressed the peasant revolution. What role did all of Wu Xun's actions play in the social productive forces at the time and the comparison of class forces at the time? His collecting rent and lending money played a destructive role in the social productive forces. His running schools of injustice played a role in saving and embellishing the crumbling feudal rule, and played a role in numbing the working peasants and weakening the peasant revolutionary movement. From this it can be seen that Wu Xun was a thorough, petty, and base old figure who supported the old economy, old politics, and old culture, and only played a negative and reactionary role in Chinese history, without playing any positive role at all. Is this not obvious enough?
            II. Reformists Support Reactionaries
    The reactionary Qing dynasty, the Northern Warlords, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, and Japanese imperialism, in a word, all Chinese and foreign reactionaries have taken turns to commend and praise Wu Xun in this way. Everyone now knows that the purpose of this was to use Wu Xun, this dead slave, to try to deceive the people and destroy the people's aspirations, in order to maintain their reactionary and dark rule.
    China's bourgeois and petty-bourgeois reformists have also vigorously promoted and eulogized Wu Xun in the field of education. What was the reason for this?
    For decades, the formula of Chinese bourgeois and petty-bourgeois reformism has been: For the sake of our country and people, let imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism continue to rule! Let us advocate saving the country through industry, saving the country through education, saving the country through cooperatives, saving the country through relief work, etc.
    This bourgeois and petty-bourgeois reformism in the field of education in old China, from the time Kang Youwei put forward "abolishing the imperial examination system and running schools," has had various schools of "popular education," such as the "scientific education" school, the "people's education" school, the "vocational education" school, the "rural construction" school, and the "mass education" school, etc. In old China, in their practice, some of these schools simply went to imperialism (such as Yan Yangchu's "people's education" school) or feudalism; some have always been dying and have made no progress; and some have gradually approached the people's democratic forces. And these schools have all eulogized Wu Xun.
    This is because there are places in Wu Xun's career and "spirit of Wu Xun" that are "in tune" with these reformist ideas.
    The common and basic characteristic of the educational thoughts of all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois reformist schools is the so-called "supra-class" and "supra-political" view of education, that is, the view that education is separate from politics. They believe that classes do not exist, or even if they do, they are unimportant, and that politics is "dirty." They only want to run their "popular education," "scientific education," "people's education," "vocational education," "rural construction," "mass education," etc., "cleanly" and "freely"; and are willing to rely on this "omnipotence" of "education" to save our country. What was the result? Contrary to their declarations, the "supra-political" and "supra-class" views and practices of all reformists, in objective social practice, only planted flowers in the manure pile of reactionary rule, confused the understanding of the working people, thereby deceiving and numbing the working people, and to a certain extent weakened their fighting will, that is, in this way, they helped the rule of the internal and external reactionaries in China. This is the political task and class task that various reformists in China have truly realized in the past few decades under the guise of "supra-political" and "supra-class." This is also the clear class mark that has been imprinted on all these reformist ideas.
    What about the career and spirit of the feudal slave Wu Xun? He completely served the politics of the feudal ruling class, but he also seemed to "not ask" about politics and class, but came to "promote education," and "for the poor" he ran "free schools," and also had various "asceticism" of "begging," and was wholeheartedly for "promoting education." This so-called "strange behavior" of Wu Xun, due to the commendation of the reactionary rule over the years, has also obtained a sacred and legal status. Such a "legal" and seemingly "supra-political" and "supra-class" "educator" with "asceticism" and "for the poor" is of course an idol that is right in the hearts of all reformists in old China. Why? Because in the eyes of various reformists:
    First, Wu Xun is determined to "promote education" and "does not ask about politics," and I am also determined to promote education and am "supra-political," and "do not lean or rely";
    Second, Wu Xun promotes education through "asceticism" and "for the poor," and I use my full heart to save the country and the people to run "mass education," "worker education," and "popular education";
    Third, Wu Xun has a legal status for running schools, and I promote Wu Xun to facilitate my career, which can both win social sympathy and avoid being jailed and killed.
    Thus, in their mouths and pens, Wu Xun actually became a saint who was "immortal with the history of the Chinese nation." This also explains why all reformists in old China, for Wu Xun, such an ugly slave, because they could not see, or were afraid of, the great power of the people's revolution, would always firmly grasp him and recognize him as a life-saving benefactor; while Lu Xun, the standard-bearer of the truly great Chinese revolutionary culture, always resolutely spurned Wu Xun.
    Some reformists think that they seem to "not ask about politics," or that they can "not ask about politics," but who can not be involved in politics?
    Here we would like to quote a self-examination article by Mr. Dong Weichuan as a reference to help us study. Mr. Dong was once an enthusiastic Wu Xun eulogist. He said: "My entire ideology is based on reformism. ...Because I was afraid of serious practical struggles and dared not approach the flames of revolution, I later moved further and further away from the revolution. After the Great Revolution, I mistakenly thought that Chiang Kai-shek had successfully led the revolution and established a blind orthodox concept, so I surrendered to the counter-revolutionary camp without reservation; the young people also alienated me. When the contradictions of 'eating fish and disliking the smell' arose due to the corruption of the reactionary rule and the endless civil wars of the warlords, I thought that I was 'supra-political' and that the education I was running was also 'supra-political.' Therefore, I made up my mind that I could only bury myself in running education and not ask about anything else, so that I could be detached from everything, and I dreamed of playing a progressive role through the education I was running. In educational ideology and technology, I copied and plagiarized from the East and the West, feudal, comprador, and pieced together in a mess. This situation was most obvious during the few years I ran mass education. ...During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I followed the Kuomintang step by step as they fled to the rear. ...At this time, I read more books, and there were more reform methods, so I sorted out a set of American, Mexican, Danish, and even Zouping, Dingxian, and Xiaozhuang... These fantasies... exposed the crimes of reactionary education, which the progressive youth were happy to hear. At the same time, these non-revolutionary but reformist methods were also suitable for the tastes of young people from bourgeois or petty-bourgeois backgrounds; as for those secret agent students, although they were uncomfortable with some of my words, they had no reason to oppose me because I had no demand to overthrow the reactionary rule. However, some progressive students felt that my reform methods were castles in the air, and they were anxious and upset." Mr. Dong then said, "However, I did not dare to face the revolution squarely, approach the revolution, and arrange myself in the 'supra-political' 'middle route'." (Dong Weichuan, "The Lessons Wu Xun's Problem Taught Me," Guangming Daily, July 12). It was on this ideological basis that Mr. Dong "greatly indulged" in Wu Xun.
    Mr. Dong's self-examination is sincere and beneficial to both himself and others. He provides a vivid portrayal of a Chinese petty-bourgeois reformist. As an upper-class petty-bourgeois element in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, he has long wavered and hesitated between the landlord bourgeoisie and the working people, and wavered between revolution and counter-revolution. Due to this petty-bourgeois wavering and the dependence of the upper-class petty-bourgeois elements on the reactionary rule, he has long backed on the reactionary ruling class and sang the faint reformist elegy composed of noise. As Mr. Dong himself analyzed, this elegy had deceived some progressive youth, pleased those youth from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois backgrounds, and at the same time, because of his "supra-politics," he had obtained a legal status in old China, and even the secret agent students had no reason to oppose him; but it had also angered some progressive youth. This situation proves that the conclusion made by Mr. Dong himself is correct. He said: "Because I held the fantasy of 'supra-politics' and 'supra-class,' I ran education for the reactionary ruling class for nearly thirty years, that is, I relied on the reactionary forces to live for nearly thirty years. I once devoted myself to the literacy movement, and at the time I thought I had achieved great results, but the results, in addition to putting powder on the reactionary ruling class, also cultivated slaves with a certain level of culture that could be driven and exploited for the reactionary ruling class." (Dong Weichuan, "The Mistake Lies in My 'Education' Viewpoint," Guangming Daily, June 27).
    Mr. Dong's self-examination can serve as a mirror for many educators today. Even now, aren't many educators still claiming to be "noble" and unwilling to have a relationship with revolutionary politics, or unwilling to have an "overly close relationship" with revolutionary politics? Aren't they still stubbornly thinking that "when Chiang Kai-shek was in power, we taught books; when the Communist Party comes, don't we still teach books"? Aren't they still doing the old trick of "education for education's sake," not asking whether it is beneficial to the youth and children of New China, and stubbornly unwilling to change their educational content and teaching methods that are detrimental to the motherland and the people? Such bourgeois objectivist thoughts and reformist thoughts will definitely find appropriate reflections in the discussion of the Wu Xun problem.
    Here, we would like to mention a problem that is commonly encountered in the discussion of the Wu Xun problem, that is, how should we evaluate the educators in old China?
    Does the across-the-board negation of Wu Xun equal the across-the-board negation of the educators in old China? No. It would undoubtedly be wrong to compare all the educators in old China to Wu Xun.
    In old China, for example, in China under the rule of the Kuomintang, the education implemented by the reactionary Kuomintang government, as the dominant form of education at the time, was reactionary and anti-people. This education embodied the imperialist cultural and ideological aggression against the Chinese people, and embodied the feudalist and bureaucrat-capitalist oppression and deception of the Chinese people's culture and ideology. This was entirely a thing that served the old economy and the old politics, and it was also the most important and basic thing in the education of old China. It had caused great harm to the youth and the people of China. Attached to this main aspect, and as its supplement, there was also the reformist education of "scientific education," "mass education," "vocational education," and "productive education," etc. This education had given the Chinese people a certain amount of cultural, scientific knowledge and skills, and it was precisely because of this that it had put powder on the above-mentioned basic ugly aspect. At the same time, this education had instilled reformist ideas into the Chinese people, blurring the people's understanding and weakening the people's fighting will. In the cracks between the above two kinds of education, some Communist Party members and other revolutionaries who worked in the Kuomintang-ruled areas had also done some revolutionary educational work under the cover of legality, and had instilled Marxist-Leninist revolutionary ideological education into the youth. This work was extremely small in number in the Kuomintang areas, and its nature and results were completely contrary to the will and policy of the Kuomintang reactionaries. It was a result of the expansion of the people's revolutionary forces led by the Chinese Communist Party, not a result of the Kuomintang reactionaries' implementation of education.
    Generally speaking, anyone who has served in the educational circles of old China can find the role they once played in the following components.
    The first category is the resolute implementers of the Kuomintang's reactionary education policy, including the organizers and implementers of the Kuomintang's secret agent education. Obviously, they are the reactionaries in educational work. They should be resolutely opposed by the Chinese people, and those who are extremely guilty and unrepentant until death should be suppressed by the people. These people only accounted for a very small number among the educators in old China. These people and Yang Shufang and Wu Xun were of the same kind.
    The second category is various reformists who promoted and promoted reformist education, and basically served the reactionary rule (some of them, such as Yan Yangchu, became direct pawns of imperialism and feudalism, that is, they became the first category of people; others became revolutionaries). These people should be criticized by the Chinese people, and they should strive to liquidate their bourgeois or petty-bourgeois reformist ideas today. These people are often eulogists of Wu Xun.
    The third category is those who were teachers for the sake of their personal lives. This is the vast majority. They were dissatisfied with the reactionary rule and their own situation, but they did not have the determination to resist, and to some extent objectively promoted the Kuomintang's reactionary education. This vast number of teachers who suffered in life were by no means the big landlords, big usurers, and big rogues like Wu Xun, but they were often deceived and became prisoners of the spirit of Wu Xun. In New China, this vast number of teachers must resolutely overcome their individualism and other wrong ideas, and develop the revolutionary idea of serving the people. If they still insist on their old ways of taking care of themselves, they will continue to cause losses to the people's cause.
    The fourth category is revolutionary educators who propagated Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in old China and cultivated revolutionary cadres who took the overthrow of the reactionary rule as their responsibility. This kind of person only accounted for a small number among the educators in old China, and they were the true glory of the educators in old China. Today, all our educators should learn from them, and they themselves must also strive to learn.
            III. Why Tao Xingzhi Eulogized Wu Xun
    Tao Xingzhi's Life Education Society was initially a reformist educational faction, but later gradually became a revolutionary democratic faction. However, Mr. Tao did not completely break with reformism in his thinking. And that is why he enthusiastically praised Wu Xun.
    How did Mr. Tao once praise Wu Xun? He said: "I often say that Mr. Wu Xun's spirit can be expressed by three 'nones' and four 'haves'. He had no money, no backing, and no school education. But the reason why he was able to run three schools was because of his four 'haves': first, he had a grand vision that met the needs of the masses; second, he had methods that met his own abilities; third, he had integrity that distinguished between public and private; fourth, he had the determination to persevere to the end to the best of his ability. Because he had these four magic weapons, not only did he run three schools as a beggar, but his three schools have survived all kinds of disasters and difficulties to this day, and will continue to exist in the infinite future, and will unconsciously influence and change thousands of aspiring people, jumping out of their own small circles and devoting themselves to the happiness of the masses." ("Postscript to the Re-edition of Mr. Wu Xun's Portrait," 1944). He also said: "Wu Xun, who is locked in the cage of saints, should be liberated. If all 450 million people learn from Wu Xun, they will all be saints. ...We should break through this circle, let Wu Xun fly into the arms of 450 million people, let Wu Xun fly into the arms of all the people of China, fly into everyone's minds to play a role, so that the big ones can be big Wu Xuns, the small ones can be small Wu Xuns, the men can be men Wu Xuns, and the women can be women Wu Xuns." ("Speech at the Mr. Wu Xun Memorial Meeting"). Mr. Tao himself and some of Mr. Tao's students compared Mr. Tao to the "new Wu Xun."
    Because Mr. Tao once compared himself to the "new Wu Xun" and once enthusiastically eulogized Wu Xun, individual Wu Xun critics therefore believed that Tao Xingzhi was equal to Wu Xun, and said that Tao Xingzhi was also a reactionary like Wu Xun, or a "'helper' or even 'accomplice' of the reactionary rulers." (Luo Mufa: "I Disagree with Mr. Li Shizhao's Self-Criticism," Guangming Daily, June 5). This view is completely wrong. Why?
    First, in contrast to Wu Xun, who was a reactionary and a docile tool of the reactionaries, Tao Xingzhi in his later years undoubtedly belonged to the revolutionary faction in politics. Tao Xingzhi in his later years resolutely followed the Chinese Communist Party, actively participated in and led the Chinese people's national salvation movement, opposed Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, and resolutely advocated the implementation of democracy. Finally, under the cruel oppression of US imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and in the tenacious struggle against the enemy, he died gloriously at his battle post. Mr. Tao's spirit of fighting for China's independence, freedom, and democracy, and for the happiness of the Chinese people, is forever worthy of everyone's commemoration.
    Second, in the field of education, the free school run by Wu Xun, its purpose and content were entirely for the service of the feudal class, and it was a completely reactionary education. The school run by Tao Xingzhi was a democratic and scientific education. The education he ran in his later years was an education that opposed imperialism and feudalism, and was close to the worker-peasant masses. He was a resolute opponent of the Kuomintang's reactionary education policy and reactionary education facilities. Although there were serious shortcomings and errors in Tao Xingzhi's educational thought, the educational career he ran, especially the educational career he ran after the "September 18th Incident," was beneficial to the Chinese people, and was hated by the reactionary rulers at the time, and suffered all kinds of oppression and destruction. This is completely the opposite of Wu Xun's free school being commended and erected monuments by the reactionary Qing dynasty, the Northern Warlords, and the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and being extremely favored.
    Then, why would a revolutionary democrat and democratic educator like Tao Xingzhi promote Wu Xun to this extent?
    Some people explain that this is because Tao Xingzhi ran a school under the rule of the Kuomintang, and "had no money and no backing," so he raised the signboard of Wu Xun to obtain a legal status and facilitate fundraising. This explanation may explain the specific motives of Mr. Tao's eulogizing Wu Xun at the time, but it does not explain the ideological source of his eulogizing Wu Xun. People have the right to ask: Why didn't Mr. Tao look at the anti-Japanese democratic base areas at that time, where the people's education was developing so vigorously because the people had already seized power? Why didn't Mr. Tao concentrate his efforts on revolution, but instead spent so much energy running educational undertakings such as "Talent Training Schools" in the Kuomintang areas that were obviously impossible to develop, and even in the end, when he was at his wit's end, he would find a dead wood like Wu Xun to serve as his signboard?
    The real reason why Tao Xingzhi eulogized Wu Xun lies in the fact that his educational thought was basically still a petty-bourgeois reformist thought. Although Mr. Tao's thought was constantly advancing in the thirty years, and we can also estimate that if he could live to this day, his educational thought could be further developed, until Mr. Tao's death, his educational thought was not a proletarian educational thought, but a petty-bourgeois democratic educational thought. There is still a principle difference between his educational thought and the Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong educational thought. The two belong to different things of two different worldviews. Tao Xingzhi's formula of "life is education" is a one-sided, anti-scientific, and anti-Marxist formula. This empiricist formula prevented Mr. Tao from correctly understanding the importance of scientific theory, correctly understanding the decisive role of economy and politics in education, and the decisive role of economic and political revolution in educational reform. (The criticism of Tao Xingzhi's theory of life education itself will be written in another article, and will not be detailed in this article.) Under reactionary rule, the primary task of the working people is to launch and develop the people's revolution. Without concentrating efforts to launch the people's revolution to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, there can be no basis for the existence and development of new culture and new education. But Mr. Tao, although he actively participated in the anti-Japanese and democratic struggles in the later period of his life, and turned his school into a base for democratic struggles, he always tried to maintain and develop his life education and promote his popular education in the rule of the reactionaries with most of his energy. Although Mr. Tao's thought has been proven by objective reality many times to be just an unrealizable fantasy, he still insisted on this fantasy to the "best of his ability." And Mr. Tao's eulogy of Wu Xun found its basis here. "Asceticism to promote education" is a false image of Wu Xun, but it is Mr. Tao's characteristic. The "four haves" that he praised Wu Xun for were not what Wu Xun really had, but what Mr. Tao wanted to achieve in his educational career. Mr. Tao completely abandoned politics and put forward the so-called "four haves," which is a typical manifestation of the reformist elements in Mr. Tao's thought. The reformist nature of Mr. Tao's educational thought is also clearly manifested in his evaluation of Duan Shengwu, another successor of Wu Xun. He said: "Duke Duan Shengwu was a man of lofty ideals who was influenced by him (referring to Wu Xun - Qian). Since he was stationed in Tai'an and heard about Wu Xun's deeds of begging to promote education, he was greatly moved and called himself 'returning stolen goods to atone for sins'. He sold his houses and carriages, established Baotou New Village, and implemented collective production based on the principle of peasants owning cultivated land, in order to create a society of common labor and equal enjoyment; moreover, he implemented life education in order to create a new countryside and establish a new culture... He is developing and carrying forward Wu Xun's spirit with different times, different positions, and different cultivation... In my opinion, China still needs Wu Xun, needs Shengwu, and needs thousands upon thousands of incarnations of Wu Xun and Shengwu to complete the great cause of resisting Japan and building the country" ("Postscript to the Re-edition of Mr. Wu Xun's Portrait"). This passage was written by Mr. Tao in April 1944. From this it can be seen that Mr. Tao had not abandoned the utopian "new village" until the last period of his life, and was still advocating the reformism of "implementing life education (not implementing land reform and overthrowing the rule of the feudal class - Qian) in order to create a new countryside".
    Chairman Mao said in his article "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan": "As a result of the development of the peasant movement, the culture of the peasants will naturally be improved. In a short period of time, thousands of schools will spring up in the countryside throughout the province. It is not like the intellectuals and the so-called 'educators', who shout empty slogans of 'popular education', and shouting and shouting is still a waste of words."
    This is the fundamental difference between the petty-bourgeois educational thought and the Marxist-Leninist educational thought. This is why Mr. Tao would so enthusiastically eulogize people like Wu Xun, while a true Marxist would definitely completely negate Wu Xun and point out that he was a shameful slave of the reactionary ruling class.
    Five years ago, in an article entitled "A Giant of a Generation: Tao Xingzhi" in memory of Mr. Tao's death, I once said these words: "Mr. Tao's life history is a history of continuous progress in struggle. He transformed from a European-style liberalist, an old democrat, into a radical democrat, and finally into a communist." Mr. Tao's life history is a history of continuous progress, this is a fact, and this is what makes him worthy of people's learning. Mr. Tao may have accepted communism in terms of political program, but it is not in line with reality to estimate Mr. Tao as "finally transformed into a communist" ideologically, so this estimate is wrong, and I should correct it here. The fact is that the main reason why Mr. Tao enthusiastically eulogized people like Wu Xun was because his educational thought basically belonged to the category of petty-bourgeois reformism, and not to the category of communist thought.

　　从讨论武训问题我们学到些什么
       钱俊瑞
            一、不能翻案的“论定”
    武训究竟是个什么样子的人？这个问题，经过了三个多月来的讨论，特别是发表了“武训历史调查记”，是已经彻底地解决了：
    首先，武训是一个从贫农家庭出身，背离了劳动人民，以“行乞”为手段，以“兴学”为招牌，与地主恶霸相勾结，被满清反动政府赋予特权，反对当时的农民革命，为整个地主阶级和反动政府忠诚服务的十分凶恶的大流氓、大债主和大地主。
    第二，武训并不是资产阶级的或小资产阶级的改良主义者。从他的阶级地位（大地主、大债主）和一切行动（包括“兴学”）的目的和效果来检查，他是彻头彻尾的封建主义反动派。有人把武训看作改良主义者，这是不对的。实际上，武训是实行西太后的反革命路线的最忠实最驯服的走狗。
    第三，当然，他更不是如同某些狂热的武训歌颂者所宣扬的所谓“劳动人民的伟大典型”，“被压迫被剥削的劳动人民的先觉者”了。武训在背离了劳动人民之后的一切所谓“苦行”都不过是为要成为更大的地主和债主，更加有效地为封建阶级服务的精巧的伪装和恶毒的手段而已。
    在讨论武训问题的时候，关于武训其人其事的评价，许多人曾提出下列的问题：
    第一，动机与效果的问题。
    “武训兴学的结果虽然只为封建地主阶级服务，但是他兴学的动机是好的。”这是把动机效果分离的看法。毛主席说过，“唯心论者是强调动机否认效果的，机械唯物论者是强调效果否认动机的，我们与这两者相反，我们是辩证唯物主义的动机与效果的统一论者。”（“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”）为大众服务的动机和为大众所欢迎的效果是决然分不开的；同样，为个人为反动统治阶级服务的动机和不利于人民大众的效果也决然分不开的。武训“兴学”的动机，不能离开他“兴学”的效果来判断。我们曾经坚持这种观点，而许多人曾经怀疑这种观点。武训历史的调查彻底解决了这个问题。武训的动机究竟是怎样的呢？
    和武训的辩护者所宣传的相反，根据“武训历史调查记”，武训“立志兴学”是因为不愿继续“扛活”，和他的母亲哥哥闹翻了，脱离了贫农家庭，“当了大要饭的”之后的事情，而并非如一般传说，他先立志“兴学”，然后去要饭的。为要得到更多的钱财，和地主阶级的赏识，才打起“兴学”的招牌来“行乞”。这就是武训最初想“兴学”的真实的动机。
    事实证明了，武训并没有真正努力于“兴学”，他所努力的只在于买地和放债，甚至有像郭芬那样的人愿意拿地出来帮他办学，他也坚决不干。直到他行乞了三十年，拥有土地近三顷，单在堂邑积钱七千吊的时候，也就是说，当他已经成为大地主大债主的时候，他才奉了恶霸地主杨树坊的命令，为着地主阶级而不是为着农民的利益，办起他的第一所义学来。
    因此，那种认为武训办学的动机是好的，企图借此连武训办学的结果是反动的一点也加以否定的唯心的分析，是错误的。
    第二，道德标准问题。
    武训的歌颂者拼命宣传武训的“苦行”，他的“清风亮节”，他的“三十年如一日，坚忍不拔，克服困难”的精神。有人从此就发问道：“用武训这种精神来为人民服务有什么不好呢？”“况且我们现在已有了党的正确领导，基本上革命不会走向改良主义的道路，在这样的历史条件下，学习武训的精神会有什么危险呢？”（秦守文，“武训精神真正不值得学习吗？”南京新华日报，六月十日）。
    这里就产生了道德标准的问题，也就是判断一个人的行为应以什么为尺度的问题。
    一世纪来，武训的“道德”，受尽了满清皇朝，北洋军阀、国民党反动派和日本帝国主义的恩宠和表扬。这是为的什么？在同一个世纪里，我们祖国有多少爱国的、革命的志士仁人，多少工人和农民被帝国主义者，满清皇朝、北洋军阀和国民党反动派所侮辱、所屠杀。这又为的是什么？这一个鲜明的对照，难道还不足以说明武训的流氓式的“苦行”和十足的奴性，恰恰是最适合于反动统治阶级利益的“道德”，恰恰是近代中国的内外反动派十分有效和毒辣的精神武器吗？
    具体地说，武训有什么道德是可以为今天的人民所取法呢？武训“行乞”，难道“行乞”是一种道德吗？我们能够提倡人民行乞吗？他吃蛇蝎、吃瓦片、吃粪尿、爬下来装牲口给人骑，学驴狗叫等等，都是他装疯作傻，哄骗讹诈的手段，其目的无非是要劳动人民多给他些钱，或是迫着人家不能不还他的债。难道这些也是我们所能够提倡人民身体力行的“道德”吗？“武训历史调查记”以无可批驳的凭据告诉我们：和武训歌颂者的宣传相反，在武训身上找不到一点“孝行”和“友爱”，他是既不孝又不友，是一个无情无义的人。说武训“不好名”“反对立碑坊”也是假的，武训不是曾着人抬着“乐善好施”的匾额“在柳林镇上游街数日”吗？武训歌颂者连武训“不娶妻”一点也要大加宣扬，好像独身和禁欲应该成为我们的国民公德似的，谁知他们在这一点上也落了个空，武训倒凭着他一付流氓手段，替人家说了许多亲，自己也拜上了许多“干娘”。至于武训见了人就叩头下跪，在歌颂武训的人看来也认为是一种道德的，甚至比之于鲁迅的“俯首甘为孺子牛”的精神，那真是对中国人民和鲁迅最大的污辱！武训见了地主、豪绅和地主商人的子弟叩头下跪，不敢和他们在一起吃饭之类，正是一个封建奴才的最下贱最可耻的品质的表现。谁在今天还提倡这种“道德”，谁就是鼓吹奴才思想，以便利于国内外反动派在中国的复辟。我们决不容这种奴才精神在新中国再现。已经站立起来了的中国人民是伟大祖国的主人，我们决不应向任何人卑躬屈节。我们要继承和发扬的乃是中国人民所固有的勤劳、勇敢，对劳动人民的忠诚老实、团结友爱等高尚的品质。我们要培养和提高的乃是共同纲领所规定的爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物等项国民公德。这就是新中国人民的道德标准，“武训精神”吗，凡属中国人民都应该把它丢到毛厕里去。
    第三，所谓一概抹煞的问题：
    有一种意见认为：“武训是历史人物，我们不能苛求他，要以历史唯物观点来分析他、批判他，给予一个适当的评论。因此，说今天歌颂表扬武训者固然是错误，崇拜武训精神者更错误。但是完全抹煞武训一切，不折不扣的说成历史罪人也是不对的。”（“武训精神可以一概抹煞吗？”皖北日报一九五一年六月十七日。）
    我们对一个历史人物进行分析和评价的时候究竟应该采取什么态度呢？应该采取历史唯物主义的态度，也就是说，应该具体地分析当时当地历史环境的特点，在阶级社会中主要是分析当时阶级的对立和对比的情况，同时分析某一具体历史人物与各该阶级的关系，以及对当时的社会生产力和当时阶级力量的对比所发生的作用。用这种态度来研究武训问题，也就像“人民日报”社论所说的，我们要“研究自从一八四○年鸦片战争以来的一百多年中，中国发生了一些什么向着旧的社会经济形态及其上层建筑（政治、文化等等）作斗争的新的社会经济形态、新的阶级力量、新的人物和新的思想，而去决定什么东西是应当称赞或歌颂的，什么东西是不应当称赞或歌颂的，什么东西是应当反对的”。
    武训在当时的历史条件下面，究竟曾和什么阶级建立密切的联系呢？和地主阶级与满清皇朝，还是和劳动农民及其领袖人物宋景诗等？很显然，他是和前者相联系，而不是和后者相联系。很显然，他是劳动农民的直接剥削者，是镇压农民革命的反动头子杨树坊的帮凶。武训的一切行动对当时的社会生产力和当时阶级力量的对比曾经起了什么作用呢？他收租放债，就是对社会生产力起了破坏的作用。他办不义之学，就是起了挽救和粉饰那个摇摇欲坠的封建统治的作用，起了麻醉劳动农民、削弱农民革命运动的作用。由此可知，武训是一个彻头彻尾的，拥护旧经济、旧政治、旧文化的渺小和下贱的旧人物，在中国历史上只起着消极的反动作用，而丝毫没有起过任何积极的作用，这难道还不明显吗？
            二、改良派为反动派撑腰
    满清皇朝、北洋军阀、蒋介石反动集团和日本帝国主义，一句话，一切中外反动派曾经轮番地如此嘉奖和表扬着武训，其目的现在尽人皆知是为了借武训这个死奴才。企图哄骗人民，灭人民之志气，借以保持自己的反动黑暗的统治。
    中国的资产阶级和小资产阶级的改良派，也曾经在教育工作的范围内大肆鼓吹和歌颂了武训。这又是为的什么呢？
    几十年来中国资产阶级的和小资产阶级的改良主义的公式就是：为着我们的国家和人民，让帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义照常统治下去吧！让我们来提倡工业救国、教育救国、办合作社救国、办救济事业救国等等吧。
    这种资产阶级的和小资产阶级的改良主义在旧中国的教育工作范围内，从康有为提出了“废科举、办学校”起，就有各种各式的“普及教育”的派别，如“科学教育”派、“平民教育”派、“职业教育”派、“乡村建设”派、“民众教育”派等等。在旧中国，这些派别在他们的实践中，有的干脆地投奔帝国主义（如晏阳初等的“平民教育”派）或封建主义而去了；有的始终奄奄一息，毫无起色；有的则逐渐地和人民民主势力相接近。而这些派别都歌颂了武训。
    这是因为在武训的事业与“武训精神”中有和这些改良主义的思想互相“合拍”的地方。
    一切资产阶级的和小资产阶级改良主义派的教育思想的共同和基本的特点，就是所谓“超阶级”“超政治”的教育观，就是教育与政治分离的看法。他们认为阶级是不存在的，或者虽然存在也是不关重要的，政治则是“肮脏”的，他们只愿意“清高”和“自在”地办他们的“普及教育”、“科学教育”、“平民教育”、“职业教育”、“乡村建设”、“民众教育”等等；并且愿意凭着这个“教育”之“万能”来救我们的国家。结果怎样呢？还和他们的宣言相反，一切改良派的这种“超政治”“超阶级”的观点和作法，在客观的社会实践上，只是为反动统治的粪堆插上了花朵，迷糊了劳动人民的认识，从而欺骗和麻醉了劳动人民，并在一定程度上削弱了他们的战斗意志，也就是这样，帮助了中外反动派在中国的统治。这就是几十年来中国各种各色的改良派在“超政治”“超阶级”的幌子下所曾真实地实现了的政治任务和阶级任务。这也就是一切这些改良主义思想所被打上的明确的阶级烙印。
    封建奴才武训的事业与精神怎样呢？他完全为封建统治阶级的政治而服务，但是恍怫他也“不问”什么政治与阶级而来“兴学”，而且“为贫寒”兴“义学”，而且有种种“行乞”之“苦行”，一心一意为“兴学”。武训的这种所谓“奇行”，由于历来反动统治的嘉奖，又取得了神圣的合法的地位。这样一个“合法”的而且像煞有介事地被渲染为“超政治”“超阶级”的有“苦行”而又“为贫寒”的“教育家”，在旧中国的一切改良派看来当然是恰中下怀的偶像了。为什么？因为在各种改良派看来：
    第一，武训立志“兴学”而“不问政治”，我也立志兴学而“超政治”，而“不偏不依”；
    第二，武训以“苦行”兴学而“为贫寒”，我则以满腔救国救民之心，来办“民众教育”、“工人教育”、“普及教育”；
    第三，武训办学有合法地位，我鼓吹武训，以便利我之事业，既可以博取社会同情，又可以不遭坐牢杀头之祸。
    于是武训就在他们的口里和笔下居然成为“与中华民族的历史同垂不朽”的圣人了。这也就说明了：为什么一切改良派在旧中国，对于武训这样一个丑恶的奴才，因为看不见，或者害怕人民革命的伟大力量，总会把他牢牢抓住，认他为救命恩人一般；而真正伟大的中国革命文化的旗手鲁迅对于武训则从来就加以坚决的唾弃。
    有些改良派自以为似乎“不问政治”了，或者可以“不问政治”了，然而谁能够没有和政治发生了关涉呢？
    在这里我们想引用董渭川先生一段自我检讨的文章，来作为帮助我们学习的资料。董先生曾经是一位热心的武训歌颂者。他说：“我的全部思想建筑在改良主义的基础上。……因为畏惧严重的实践斗争，不敢靠近革命的火焰，后来就愈走距革命愈远。大革命之后，误认为蒋介石领导革命成了功，树立起盲目的正统观念，就无保留地投降到反革命的阵营去了；青年们也就和我疏远了。及至因反动统治的贪污腐化，军阀的混战不已，而有了‘又吃鱼，又嫌腥’的矛盾时，遂以为自身是‘超政治’的，办的教育也是‘超政治’的。因此拿定主意，只有埋头办教育，不问其他，才可以超然于一切之外，并且梦想着通过自己办的教育发生进步的作用。在教育思想上和技术上，东抄西袭，封建的、买办的，杂凑乱搞。这情形，在我办民众教育的几年中最为显著。……抗战期间，随着国民党一步步向后方逃难。……这时读的书多些了，改良的办法也多些了，于是把美国的、墨西哥的、丹麦的以至于邹平的、定县的、晓庄的……整理成了一套。这些幻想，……暴露反动教育的罪恶，为进步的青年所乐闻。同时这些不革命而改良的办法也适合于资产阶级或小资产阶级出身的青年的口味；至于那些特务学生呢，虽然对于我的某些话不舒服，因我根本无推翻反动统治的要求，也就没有理由反对我。但是有些进步的学生，感到我的改良办法是空中楼阁，焦急烦闷。”董先生接着又说，“然而我却不敢正视革命，靠近革命，把自己安排在‘超政治’的‘中间路线’之列。”（董渭川“武训问题给我的教训”，光明日报七月十二日）。董先生就在这样的思想基础上，对武训便“大事陶醉”了。
    董先生的这个自我检讨是诚恳的，对己对人都是有益的。他提供了一个中国小资产阶级改良主义者的活生生的写照。作为一个半殖民地半封建中国的上层小资产阶级分子，他曾长期地动摇和徘徊于地主资产阶级与劳动人民之间，动摇于革命与反革命之间。由于这种小资产阶级的动摇性和小资产阶级上层分子的对反动统治的依赖性，他曾长期地背靠着反动统治阶级，歌唱出那首微弱的由杂音组成的改良主义的挽歌。这首挽歌，真如董先生自己所分析的，曾经骗住过一些进步青年，曾经取悦过那些从资产阶级和小资产阶级出身的青年，同时因为他的“超政治”，因而取得在旧中国的合法地位，连特务学生也没有理由反对他；但是也曾恼怒了一部分的进步青年。这种情况证明了董先生自己作的结论是正确的，他说：“因为我抱着‘超政治’、‘超阶级’的幻想，给反动统治阶级办了近乎三十年的教育，也就是依靠反动势力生活了近乎三十年。我曾经致力于扫除文盲运动，在当时自以为满有成绩，而其成绩，除给反动统治阶级搽粉以外，更为反动统治阶级培养具备一定文化水平可供驱使、供剥削的奴隶。”（董渭川，“错误在于我的‘教育’观点”，光明日报六月二十七日）。
    董先生的这个自我检讨，今天可以作为许多教育工作者的一面镜子。直到现在，许多教育工作者不是还在自命“清高”，不愿与革命的政治发生关系，或者不愿与革命的政治发生“过分密切的关系”吗？他们不是还在执拗地认为“蒋介石在时，我们是教书；共产党来了，我们还不是同样教书”吗？他们不是还在干“为教育而教育”的老一套，不问对新中国的青年儿童有利无利，固执地不愿改变他们不利于祖国与人民的教育内容和教学方法吗？诸如此类的资产阶级的客观主义思想和改良主义思想，在武训问题的讨论中是一定会找到适当的反映的。
    在这里，我们想顺便说到在这次武训问题的讨论中所普遍遇到的一个问题，那就是对旧中国的教育工作者应该如何评价的问题。
    对武训的一概抹煞，是不是等于对旧中国的教育工作者也一概抹煞呢？不是的。把旧中国的教育工作者都比作武训，无疑是错误的。
    在旧中国，比方说，在国民党统治下的中国，那种由国民党反动政府所实施的教育，作为当时教育的统治形态，那是反动的、反人民的。这种教育体现了帝国主义对中国人民的文化思想的侵略，体现了封建主义与官僚资本主义对中国人民的文化思想的压迫与欺骗。这是完全服务于旧经济、旧政治的东西，也是旧中国教育的最主要和基本的东西。它曾给中国的青年和人民以很大的危害。依附于这主要的一面的，并且作为它的补充的，还有所谓“科学教育”、“民众教育”、“职业教育”、“生产教育”等等改良主义的教育，这种教育曾给中国人民以一定的文化科学的知识和技能，正因为这样，也就给上述基本的丑恶的一面搽上了粉。同时，这种教育曾向中国人民灌输改良主义的思想，模糊了人民的认识，削弱了人民的斗志。在上述两种教育的夹缝中，一部分在国民党统治区工作的共产党员和其他革命分子，在合法的掩护下，也曾多少作了一些革命的教育工作，对青年灌输马列主义的革命思想教育。这种工作在国民党地区，数量是极少的，其性质与结果是完全违反国民党反动派的意志和政策的。它是中国共产党所领导的人民革命力量扩大的一种结果，而不是国民党反动派实施教育的结果。
    凡在旧中国教育界服务过的人，一般地都能在下述几种构成部分中找到自己所曾经担任的角色。
    第一类是国民党反动教育政策的坚决执行者，其中包括国民党特务教育的组织者和实行者。很显然，他们是教育工作中的反动分子。他们应当受到中国人民坚决的反对，其中罪大恶极，至死不悟的，应该受到人民的镇压。这在旧中国的教育工作者中间只占极少数。这些人和杨树坊、武训是一流人。
    第二类是各种各色的改良派，他们提倡和推行改良主义的教育，基本上为反动统治服务（其中有些人如晏阳初等则变为帝国主义、封建主义的直接的走狗，也就是说变成第一类人物；另外有些人则变为革命者。）这些人应该受到中国人民的批评，他们今天应该努力清算自己资产阶级或小资产阶级的改良主义思想。这批人常常是武训的歌颂者。
    第三类是为着个人的生活，而为人师。这是极大多数。他们是不满意于反动统治和他们自己的境遇的，但是他们没有反抗的决心，并且多少在客观上推行了国民党的反动教育。这批广大的生活痛苦的教师决不是大地主大债主大流氓的武训，但往往因为被欺骗而成为武训精神的俘虏。在新中国，这批广大的教师必须坚决地克服自己的个人主义和其他的错误思想，发展为人民服务的革命思想。如其他们还坚持自顾自的老样子，他们就会继续给人民事业以损失。
    第四类是革命的教育工作者，他们在旧中国宣传马列主义和毛泽东思想，培养以推翻反动统治为己任的革命干部。这种人在旧中国的教育工作者中只占少数，他们是旧中国的教育工作者的真正的光荣。今天，我们的一切教育工作者都应该向他们学习，而他们自己也要努力学习。
            三、陶行知为什么歌颂武训
    陶行知先生的生活教育社，起初也是改良主义的教育派别，后来逐渐变成了革命的民主派别。但是陶先生在思想上并没有与改良主义完全决裂。而这就是他狂热地颂扬过武训的原因。
    陶先生曾经怎样歌颂武训呢？他说：“我常说武训先生的精神，可以三个无四个有来表现他。他一无钱，二无靠山，三无学校教育。但他所以能办三个学校，是因为他的四有：一、他有合于大众需要的宏愿，二、他有合于自己能力的办法，三、他有公私分明的廉洁，四、他有尽其在我坚持到底的决心。因为他有这四个法宝，他不但是以一个乞丐办了三个学校，而且他的三个学校经过千灾万难还一直存在到现在，而且还会存在于无限之将来，而且还会于不知不觉之中影响改变千千万万有志之士，跳出自己之小圈而致力于大群之幸福。”（“武训先生画传再版跋”，一九四四年）。他又说：“关在圣人笼子里的武训应该解放出来，如果四万万五千万人都学武训，就都是圣人。……我们应该把这个圈子冲破，让武训飞到四万万五千万人的怀抱里，让武训飞到全中国的老百姓怀抱里，飞到每一个人的脑子里去起作用，使得大的做大武训，小的做小武训，男的做男武训，女的做女武训。”（“武训先生纪念会发言”）。陶先生自己和若干陶先生的学生们又把陶先生比为“新武训”。
    因为陶先生曾经自比为“新武训”，并且曾经热烈地歌颂武训，个别的武训批评者从此就认为陶行知就等于武训，就说陶行知也是武训那样的反动派，或是“反动统治者的‘帮闲’甚至‘帮凶’。”（罗慕法：“我不同意李士钊先生的检讨”，光明日报六月五日）。这种意见是完全错误的。为什么？
    第一，与武训是个反动派和反动派的驯服工具相反，陶行知先生的后期在政治上毫无疑问是属于革命派。后期的陶先生坚决地跟着中国共产党走，积极参加和领导中国人民救国运动，反对日本帝国主义和蒋介石反动派，坚决主张实行民主。最后他在美帝国主义和国民党反动派的残酷压迫下，并在与敌人的顽强斗争中光荣地死在他的战斗岗位上。陶先生的这种为中国的独立、自由、民主和为中国人民的幸福而奋斗的精神，是永远值得大家纪念的。
    第二，在教育事业上，武训所办的义学，其目的和内容都是十足为封建阶级服务的，是完全反动的教育。陶行知所办的学校则是民主的、科学的教育，在他后期所办的教育是反对帝国主义和封建主义的教育，是接近工农群众的教育。他是坚决反对国民党的反动教育政策和反动教育设施的人。尽管在陶先生的教育思想中有严重的缺点和错误，但他所办的教育事业，尤其“九一八”后他所办的教育事业，是有利于中国人民的，而为当时的反动统治者所痛恨，并受其百般压迫和摧残的。这和武训的义塾受到满清皇朝、北洋军阀和蒋介石匪帮的旌表立碑，宠爱备至，是决然相反的。
    那么，为什么以陶行知这样一个革命民主派和民主教育家，会把武训推崇到这般田地呢？
    有人解释道，这是因为陶先生在国民党统治下办学，“一无钱，二无靠山”，就抬出武训这块牌子，取得合法地位，便于募款。这种解释也许可以说明当时陶先生歌颂武训的具体动机，但并没有说明他歌颂武训的思想根源。人们有权利发问道：为什么陶先生不放眼看看在当时的抗日民主根据地里面，因为人民已经取得了政权，人民教育事业就那样蓬蓬勃勃地开展呢？为什么陶先生不集中力量搞革命，而偏偏要花这样多的精力在国民党地区办些显然无法开展的“育才学校”之类的教育事业，甚至最后，日暮途穷，会找到武训这样一块朽木来作自己的招牌呢？
    陶先生歌颂武训的真实原因就在于他的教育思想基本上还是小资产阶级的改良主义思想。尽管陶先生在三十年中的思想是不断前进的，而且我们也可以估计，如果他能活到现在，他的教育思想是可能作进一步发展的，但是，直到陶先生临终时，他的教育思想还并不是无产阶级的教育思想，而是小资产阶级民主主义的教育思想。在他的教育思想和马列主义的、毛泽东的教育思想之间还存在着原则的差别。两者是属于两种不同的世界观的不同东西。陶先生的“生活即教育”的公式，就是一个片面的反科学的反马克思主义的公式，这个经验主义的公式，就使陶先生不能正确地认识科学理论的重要，不能正确地认识经济、政治对于教育的决定作用和经济政治的革命对于教育改革的决定作用。（对陶先生生活教育学说本身的批判，拟另写文章，本文不详。）在反动统治下，劳动人民的首要任务是发动和发展人民革命。不集中力量来发动人民革命，以推翻反动的统治阶级，也就不能有新文化新教育存在和发展的根据。但是陶先生呢，尽管他在他一生的后期积极地参加了抗日和民主的斗争，而且使他的学校变为民主斗争的一种地盘，但他总企图在反动派统治下，用他最大部分的精力来保持和发展他的生活教育和提倡他的普及教育。陶先生的这种思想虽然很多次地被客观现实证明为仅仅是一种无法实现的幻想，但他还终“尽其在我”坚持着这种幻想。而陶先生的歌颂武训就在这里找到了根据。“苦行兴学”，是武训的假象，却是陶先生的特点。他所赞扬武训的“四有”，并非武训所真有，却是陶先生在教育事业中所要做到的。陶先生根本离开了政治，提出所谓“四有”来，这也就是陶先生思想中的改良主义因素的典型表现。陶先生的教育思想中的改良主义的性质，还清楚地表现在他对于另一个武训的继承者段绳武的评价上。他说：“段公绳武便是受他（指武训——钱）的影响而改变的一位志士。自从他驻军泰安，听到武训行乞兴学的事迹，大受感动，自称‘退赃赎罪’，将房屋车马变卖，建立包头新村，依耕地农有之原则，实行集体生产，以期造成共同劳动平等享受之社会；而且实施生活教育以期创造新乡村、建立新文化……。他是以不同的时代，不同的地位，不同的修养，发辉光大了武训的精神……依我看来中国还需要武训，需要绳武，需要千千万万武训与绳武之化身，以完成抗战建国之大业”（“武训先生画传再版跋”）。这一段话是陶先生在一九四四年四月写的。由此可知，陶先生直到一生的最后期，还没有撇开乌托邦式的“新村”，而还在提倡“实施生活教育（不是实施土地改革，推翻封建阶级的统治——钱）以期创造新乡村”的改良主义。
    毛主席在“湖南农民运动考察报告”一文中说：“农运发展的结果，农民的文化自然提高了，不久的时间内，全省当有几千所学校在乡中涌出来。不若知识阶级和所谓‘教育家’者流，空唤‘普及教育’，唤来唤去还是一句废话。”
    这就是小资产阶级的教育思想与马列主义的教育思想根本区别之所在。这也就是为什么陶先生会如此狂热地歌颂武训，而一个真正的马克思主义者则一定会全部否定武训，指斥他是反动统治阶级的可耻的奴才的道理。
    在五年前，我在追悼陶先生去世的一篇题为“一代巨人陶行知”的文章里，曾经说过这样的话：“陶先生一生的历史就是一部在斗争中不断前进的历史。他从一个欧美式的自由主义者，旧民主主义者，转变为激进的民主主义者，而最后转变为一个共产主义者。”陶先生一生的历史是不断前进的历史，这是事实，这也就是他值得人们学习的地方。陶先生也许在政治纲领上可以接受共产主义，但是从思想上把陶先生估计为“最后转变为一个共产主义者”，那是不合乎实际的，因此这种估计是错误的，我在这里应该纠正。事实是这样，陶先生之所以狂热地歌颂武训一类的人，主要地就因为他的教育思想基本上还是属于小资产阶级改良主义的范畴，而不属于共产主义思想的范畴的缘故。
