Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 9th (via teletype): Youth peace fighters from various countries participating in the World Youth and Student Peace Festival are paying close attention to the Kaesong negotiations and have denounced the American plot to obstruct the realization of peace in Korea. The head of the British youth delegation, Mr. Baum, emphasized: The unreasonable American demands regarding the military demarcation line can only prove that the Americans are not sincere when they say they want peace in Korea. We who are participating in this festival dedicated to world peace believe that the American attempt to impose their will on the Korean people risks prolonging the Korean War.

A female representative of the American youth delegation said: "The American people all hope that the negotiations will succeed. If an agreement cannot be reached and the negotiations break down, more American youth will lose their lives." She firmly advocated: "The war must be ended so that youth in America, Korea, and other countries no longer lose their lives because of the Korean War."

Brazilian writer Amado, who is participating in the festival as an honored guest, pointed out: "The Americans are trying everything possible to prevent the realization of peace in Korea. The latest American proposal once again proves who is the aggressor and who wants to continue the war. But the power of the people is greater than them. The people of the world must fight for peace."

French female youth peace fighter Raymonda Dien and the head of the Iraqi delegation both denounced the American plot to prolong the Korean War by delaying negotiations. Raymonda Dien said: The warmongers are trying to maintain a war focus in Korea so that they can launch a new world war as soon as possible. The head of the Iraqi delegation said: "We believe that the United States does not want peace and is unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. We, who are fighting for our own independence, want peace in Korea and throughout the world. We hope that Korea and other countries will achieve independence."

The head of the Pakistani delegation, Ali Khan, stated that Malik's proposal on the Korean armistice was warmly welcomed in Pakistan. Widespread protests by the Pakistani people had forced the government to announce that it would not send troops to Korea, and they support all efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

　　各国参加联欢节青年代表关切开城谈判
    一致痛斥美国拖延谈判的阴谋
    【新华社十一日讯】据电通社柏林九日讯：参加世界青年与学生和平联欢节的各国青年和平战士，都关切地注意着开城谈判，并纷纷斥责美国企图阻挠实现朝鲜和平的阴谋。英国青年代表团团长勃恩鲍姆强调指出：美国人关于军事分界线的无理要求，只能证明美国人在说他们希望朝鲜和平时是没有诚意的。我们参加这个致力于世界和平的联欢节的人，认为美国人想把他们的意旨强加于朝鲜人民的企图，有使朝鲜战争延长的危险。
    美国青年代表团的一个女代表说：“美国人民都希望谈判成功，如果不能达成协议以致谈判破裂，就有使更多的美国青年丧失生命的危险。”她坚决主张：“必须结束战争，使美国、朝鲜和其他国家的青年不再因为朝鲜战争而丧失生命。”
    以荣誉来宾资格参加联欢节的巴西名作家阿玛多指出：“美国人正想尽一切办法阻止朝鲜和平的实现。美国最近的建议再次证明谁是侵略者，谁想继续进行战争。但是人民的力量比他们更为强大。全世界人民必须为取得和平而战斗。”
    法国女青年和平战士雷蒙达·第安和伊拉克代表团团长都痛斥美国企图延长朝鲜战争而借端拖延谈判的阴谋。雷蒙达·第安说：战争贩子们企图在朝鲜保留一个战争焦点，以便使他们能够尽快地发动新的世界大战。伊拉克代表团团长说：“我们认为美国并不想和平，不愿和平解决朝鲜问题。我们这些正在为自己的独立而斗争的人，都愿意朝鲜乃至全世界都得到和平。我们希望朝鲜和其他的国家都得到独立。”
    巴基斯坦代表团团长阿里汗称：马立克的关于朝鲜停战的建议，在巴基斯坦受到热烈的欢迎。巴基斯坦人民的广泛抗议曾迫使政府宣布不派军队到朝鲜去，他们支持一切和平解决朝鲜问题的努力。
