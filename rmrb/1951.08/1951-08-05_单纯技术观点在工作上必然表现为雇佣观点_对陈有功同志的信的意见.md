　　A Purely Technical Viewpoint Inevitably Manifests as a Mercenary Viewpoint in Work
    ——Opinions on Comrade Chen Yougong's Letter
    Editor:
    I disagree with Comrade Chen Yougong's dissenting opinion, published in the People's Daily on July 10th, regarding the criticism of shortcomings in basic construction.

    I believe that the majority of reports published in the newspaper concerning engineering errors are caused by a careless and irresponsible attitude towards the people's cause. Although design and research are technical matters, the subjective consciousness to do good design and research work is not a technical issue, nor is it a matter of resources, but rather a matter of the staff's ideology and work style. Starting construction without properly surveying the site and carelessly accepting the project are all examples of an attitude that is neither careful nor responsible towards the work. We should fight against purely technical viewpoints. Comrade Chen Yougong says, "How can we succeed by relying solely on political level?" Of course, economic construction work requires a high level of technology, but this technology is mastered and utilized by people, and the dynamics of people's work are governed by their subjective ideological consciousness. This ideological consciousness is determined by the degree of political awareness. Whether the application of "technology" can well serve the people and whether abstract scientific and technological theories can be well integrated with practice depend on whether the staff mastering the technology has a high degree of enthusiasm and responsibility for the people's cause, and whether they are driven by individualistic desires for quick success or a task-oriented perspective. On the other hand, a purely technical viewpoint inevitably manifests as a mercenary viewpoint in work attitude. Consequently, it becomes impossible to proactively exert their initiative and creativity in their work. At the same time, it also hinders the combination of administrative leadership and technology, ultimately preventing the rapid and rational development of construction work, leading to some losses in the work.

    I believe that it is first necessary to resolve the subjective ideological issue of serving the people, raise political awareness, and correct the work style to care about the interests of the people and love the cause of the people. In the work process, one will naturally study carefully and plan meticulously, which will reduce many wastes due to carelessness, perfunctory behavior, and dereliction of duty. I hope everyone will discuss whether my opinions are appropriate.

### 单纯技术观点在工作上必然表现为雇佣观点——对陈有功同志的信的意见

　　单纯技术观点在工作上必然表现为雇佣观点
    ——对陈有功同志的信的意见
    编辑同志：
    我不同意人民日报七月十日登载的陈有功同志所提的关于对基本建设缺点批评的不同意见。
    我认为，报上已发表的关于工程错误的报道，绝大部分都是由于粗枝大叶对人民事业不负责的作风所招致的，设计研究虽属技术问题，但作好设计研究工作的主观意识并不属于技术问题，也不是资材问题，而是工作人员的思想问题，工作作风问题。如不勘测好基地就开工建设，马虎草率验收工程，都是对工作不细心不负责的态度。我们应和单纯技术观点作斗争。陈有功同志说：“单是靠着政治水平怎能行？”当然经济建设工作是需要高度技术的，但这技术则是为人们所掌握所运用的，同时人们的工作动态则为其主观的思想意识所支配，这种思想意识更是由于政治觉悟程度来决定的。运用“技术”是否能很好地为人民服务，抽象的科学技术理论是否能很好地与实际结合起来，这都要由掌握技术的工作人员是否对人民事业有高度的热情，高度的责任心，是否出发于个人主义的急于求功或任务观点来决定的。另一方面单纯的技术观点在工作态度上必然表现为雇佣观点，因而就不可能在工作上主动地发挥其积极性与创造性，同时也就阻碍了行政领导与技术的结合，结果自然就不能使建设工作迅速地合理地开展起来，致使工作遭到一些损失。
    我认为，必须首先解决主观方面为人民服务的思想问题，提高政治觉悟，端正工作作风才能关心人民的利益，热爱人民的事业，在工作过程中自然会细心钻研，周密计划，这样就会减少许多由于粗心大意，马虎敷衍塞责的浪费。我的意见是否有当，还希望大家来讨论。
