Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The North China sub-group of the Central People's Government's Northern Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Group departed from Beijing on the 10th. The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the North China Military Region, and the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government hosted a banquet on the 8th to bid farewell to the group members in Beijing. At the farewell banquet, Comrades Bo Yibo, Peng Zhen, Nie Rongzhen, Liu Lantao, and others unanimously encouraged all members to represent the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao with the best revolutionary friendship and the highest enthusiasm to express their regards to the people of the old revolutionary bases. Speakers at the farewell banquet pointed out that the three major liberated areas of Jinji-Luyu, Jin-Chahar-Hebei, and Jin-Sui in North China, since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, had revolutionary base areas. The Chinese Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army gathered revolutionary forces here, cooperated with revolutionary base areas throughout the country to defeat the Japanese invaders, and from here carried out the national liberation war. The people of the old revolutionary bases in North China, like other old revolutionary bases, contributed greatly and made immortal contributions in these dozen years of revolutionary struggle, mobilizing one million five hundred thousand outstanding sons and daughters to join the revolutionary troops and sending nearly 100,000 cadres to work throughout the country. There are a total of 1.55 million families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres in North China. Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government have always cared about the people of the old liberated areas. This visit on behalf of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao is of great significance. During the visit, the visiting group should report to the people of the old revolutionary bases on the current domestic and international situation, understand their hardships, solicit their opinions and demands on the Party and the government, and encourage them to continue to carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory.

The North China sub-group of the Northern Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Group is divided into three sub-groups, Jinji-Luyu, Jin-Chahar-Hebei, and Jin-Sui, according to the division of the old revolutionary bases in North China during the Anti-Japanese War. The head of the Jin-Chahar-Hebei sub-group is Cheng Zihua, and the deputy heads are Wang Ping, Yang Chunfu, Dong Luan, Fan Rusheng, and Du Cunxun; the head of the Jinji-Luyu sub-group is Yang Xiufeng, and the deputy heads are Wang Congwu, Nie Zhen, and Wang Xiaoci; the head of the Jin-Sui sub-group is Zhu Ming, and the deputy heads are Yao Zhu, Kang Yonghe, and Ma Lin. In addition to the responsible cadres of the provincial, prefectural, and county committees of the Communist Party of China, the directors of departments, commissioners, and county heads of the provincial people's governments, and cadres of leading organs who had persisted in revolutionary struggles in the respective base areas during the Anti-Japanese War, industrial model workers Yu Shihui, Ren Enfu, Zhang Shuhe, worker Zhang Jinhu, Peking University professor Hu Shihua, Tsinghua University professor Wang Zhuxi, Agricultural University professor Yu Dawei, Union Medical College professor He Guanqing, Heavy Industry School professor Li Zhehe, Nankai University professor He Qiba, Peng Zemin, and others, fourteen people in all, are participating in the visit.
