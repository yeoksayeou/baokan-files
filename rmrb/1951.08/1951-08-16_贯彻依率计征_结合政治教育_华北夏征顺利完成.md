　　Implement Tax Collection Based on Rates · Combine Political Education
　　North China Summer Grain Collection Successfully Completed
　　The summer public grain collection work in the entire North China region has been overfulfilled. As of now, the public grain collected in Hebei Province has exceeded the original estimated number by 16.38 percent, and Pingyuan Province has exceeded it by 1.51 percent. Shanxi Province has exceeded it by 3.71 percent. The suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin have also exceeded the estimated number. Because the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan produce very little wheat, they did not conduct summer collection.

　　This year's wheat harvest in North China was not better than last year, but this year's summer collection went more smoothly than last year. The fact that farmers delivered grain quickly and well is a significant characteristic of this year's summer collection. Through the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country, the patriotic consciousness and enthusiasm of North China's farmers have been further enhanced. Many village cadres, Party members, Communist Youth League members, labor models, people's representatives, and the broad masses have enthusiastically responded to the government's call to "deliver more wheat and less autumn grain." Wang Derong, a representative from Nan Guan, Linfen, Shanxi, after attending the summer collection meeting, went back to patiently propagandize, and in addition to paying the summer public grain, he also prepaid the autumn collection task. Under his mobilization and leadership, more than 70 households in the entire village paid the full year's public grain in one go. The public grain in many villages was collected in just one day or a few hours. Cang County, Hebei Province, overfulfilled the grain collection task in three days; Sanhe County, Tong County, completed the warehousing two days ahead of schedule.

　　This year's assessment of yield for summer collection in the entire region was very serious. As a result of the masses' conscious reporting and exposure, the wheat fields in Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province, increased by 190,000 mu compared to the original report, an increase of 5 percent compared to the provincial deployment; the average yield per mu increased by more than five jin, an increase of 7.4 percent compared to the original deployment. The People's Representatives Conference of all circles in Puyang County, Pingyuan, revised the yield of more than 100 villages, which were all higher than the original standard. When the Cang County, Hebei Province, held the People's Representatives Conference of all circles, the representatives all examined the errors of falsely reporting yields and concealing land; the entire prefecture reported an increase of more than 250,000 mu of wheat fields, and the average yield per mu also increased from more than 30 jin to 42 jin.

　　Implementing tax collection based on rates is also one of the important characteristics of this year's wheat collection in North China. The masses in each province support this method during the wheat collection. The masses in Pingyuan Province all said that this year "the burden is fair, the tax rate is fixed, the procedures are simple, and troubles are reduced." The wheat collection representative of Linfen County, Shanxi, believes that it is "simple and clear, reduces working hours, and is easy to calculate," and said, "We have a grasp of the bottom line!"

　　In this year's summer collection, there are still biases in various parts of North China. Many areas emphasized carrying out education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. This is correct; but the correct implementation of the burden policy was neglected, especially the policy of tax collection based on rates was not promoted enough. In some places in Pingyuan and Hebei, there were biases such as neglecting to take care of households in difficulty, and village cadres using coercive measures. For example, when village cadres in Sanhe County, Hebei, called on the masses to dry wheat, they said: "Whoever does not dry it, does not want to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea." Ma Juqiao in the Seventh District of Tong County misinterpreted "tax collection based on rates" as "collecting everything uniformly"; and misinterpreted "handling affairs according to law" as "combining wheat collection with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries." Chaijiawu and Fumuzhuang Villages interpreted "handling affairs according to law" as "if you don't pay, you will be punished according to law." These biases should be corrected.

　　贯彻依率计征·结合政治教育
    华北夏征顺利完成
    华北全区的夏季公粮征收工作已超额完成。截至目前，河北省征收的公粮已超过了原预计数的百分之十六点三八，平原省已超过了百分之一点五一。山西省已超过了百分之三点七一。北京、天津两市郊区也超过了预计数。察哈尔、绥远两省因产麦很少，未进行夏征。
    华北地区今年的麦收不比去年好，但是今年的夏征进行得比去年更加顺利。农民缴粮快，缴粮好，是今年夏征的显著特点。经过抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，华北农民爱国的觉悟和热忱更加提高。不少村干部、党员、青年团员、劳动模范、人民代表以及广大群众都热烈响应政府“多缴麦，少缴秋”的号召。山西临汾南关代表王德荣参加夏征会议后，回去耐心宣传，自己除缴夏征公粮外，又预缴秋征任务。在他动员和带领下，全村七十多户将全年公粮一次缴清。不少村庄的公粮，只在一天或几小时内就收齐。河北沧县专区三天内，超额完成了征粮任务；通县专区三河县提前两天入库。
    今年全区夏征的评定产量工作是十分认真的。由于群众自觉、自报和检举的结果，河北省天津专区麦田较原报数增加十九万亩，比省布置数增加百分之五；每亩产量平均增加五斤多，比原布置数增加百分之七点四。平原濮阳县各界人民代表会议修订了一百余村的产量，均高于原定的标准。河北沧县专区在召开各界人民代表会议时，代表们都检讨了假报产量，隐瞒土地的错误；全专区共增报麦田二十五万多亩，每亩平均产量也由三十多斤增加到四十二斤。
    贯彻依率计征也是华北今年麦征中的重要特点之一。各省在麦征中，群众对这办法都很拥护。平原省群众都说，今年“负担公平、税率固定、手续简便，减少麻烦”。山西临汾县麦征代表认为“简便明了、误工少、好算帐”，并且说“摸着底儿了！”
    在今年夏征中，华北各地还是有偏向的。不少地区强调进行了抗美援朝教育。这是正确的；但却忽视了负担政策的正确贯彻，特别是对依率计征的政策宣传得不够。平原、河北有些地方都发生忽视照顾困难户，以及村干部采用强迫命令手段等偏向。如河北三河县村干部号召群众晒麦子时说：“谁要不晒，就是不愿抗美援朝。”通县七区马驹桥把“依率计征”误解为“一律俱征”；把“依法办事”误解为“麦征与镇压反革命相结合”。柴家务、驸马庄村把“依法办事”解释为“如要不缴，依法制裁”。这些偏向应当予以纠正。
