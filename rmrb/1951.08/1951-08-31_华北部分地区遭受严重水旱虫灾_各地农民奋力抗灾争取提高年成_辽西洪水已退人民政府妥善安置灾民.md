In North China, approximately 70 million mu of autumn crops have suffered from drought, insect plagues, and floods, with some areas experiencing particularly severe conditions. For example, in Chahar Province, there had been no rain since the spring planting, and it only rained in mid-July, making the drought the worst in over a decade. However, throughout the summer, under the leadership of the People's Government, the broad masses of farmers engaged in a tenacious struggle against the disasters, greatly mitigating their impact.

In Chahar Province, which was hit hardest by the drought, approximately 10 million mu of autumn crops had withered or partially withered before the rains came in mid-July. In Shanxi Province, approximately 3 million mu of farmland could not be sown due to drought, or the seeds did not sprout after being sown. In Hebei Province, over 17 million mu of autumn crops were also lacking rain, with 6 million mu being severely affected. The insect plagues were mainly cotton aphids and locusts. Across the region, 23 million mu out of 27 million mu of cotton fields were infested with cotton aphids. In Hebei Province, the summer locust nymphs were followed by autumn locust nymphs, which were also widespread. Pingyuan Province suffered from flooding. In the western mountainous areas of the province, torrential rains in late July and early August washed away some of the mountain terraces, destroying one-fifth of the terraces in Huixian County. In total, over 9 million mu of land were flooded in Pingyuan Province. In addition, parts of Shanxi and Suiyuan Provinces were hit by wind, hail, and other disasters.

Faced with the above-mentioned disasters, the farmers of North China, under the leadership of the People's Government, waged an indomitable struggle. Since July, Chahar Province has focused on drought resistance to protect seedlings and prepare for future shortages. The Provincial People's Government and various special districts have dispatched over 1,000 cadres to the countryside, and each county in the Yanbei Special District has 3,000 cadres helping farmers combat drought. In order to dig canals and wells, the province's People's Bank issued large amounts of water conservancy loans. According to statistics from Shuoxian County in Yanbei, 50 small canals and 2,000 wells were dug this summer. In Zhuolu County, farmers along the banks of the waterless Tuanjie Canal dug 500 wells and 11 spring pits. To replenish seeds, the province's Seed Company sent personnel to Hebei and Suiyuan in July to purchase buckwheat and rapeseed. By the end of July, a total of over 700,000 jin of buckwheat and over 180,000 jin of rapeseed had been loaned out. Farmers organized themselves under the leadership of cadres to replant the withered crops. Huailai County replanted over 50,000 mu in the first three days, and by July 25, the county had completed its plan for planting buckwheat and vegetables. For autumn crops that were growing well, the government organized farmers to hoe and fertilize them more frequently, striving for a better harvest. It is estimated that Huailai County can improve its annual harvest by 10%.

Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi provinces are fighting cotton aphids more intensely this year than in previous years. This summer, due to the lack of rain, the cotton aphids kept reappearing after being treated. Farmers everywhere fully demonstrated their tenacious spirit in fighting pests. In Hebei Province, 70% of the cotton fields have been treated two or three times, and some have been treated eight or nine times. Now that North China has generally received rain, the threat of cotton aphids has basically passed. As a result of the aphid control, most areas can still strive for a good cotton harvest. Summer locust nymphs occurred in most counties of Hebei Province, but they were all wiped out. Now, farmers in Hebei are fighting autumn locust nymphs. Autumn locust nymphs have infested over 1.7 million mu of crops, and as of mid-August, over 1.1 million mu of autumn locust nymphs had been eliminated. To combat pests, People's Governments at all levels distributed countless pesticides and equipment, and the Central People's Government also sent airplanes to assist. This summer, over 100 million person-days were used in North China to fight pests.

To prevent the expansion of flooding in Pingyuan Province, the Provincial People's Government issued an emergency directive on flood prevention and drainage at the end of July and sent work teams to the countryside in early August to lead flood prevention, drainage, and replanting efforts. For areas that have already been affected, the Provincial People's Government has allocated 1 million jin of grain for emergency relief. To solve the problem of seeds for replanting late autumn crops, the province's People's Bank decided to issue 3 billion yuan in seed loans. Now, many flooded crops have been rescued, and some have been replanted. According to statistics from Heze County on August 5, over 40,000 mu of flooded crops have been rescued.

The farmers of North China have experience in fighting disasters under the leadership of the People's Government. This year, under the education of patriotism, the broad masses of farmers are even more determined to overcome disasters. In the early stages of the disasters, they still strove to complete this year's bumper harvest plan. In areas that have already been affected and have reduced yields, farmers are striving to improve the annual harvest, reduce the impact of the disasters, and are beginning to save for future shortages and develop sideline production.

Xinhua News Agency: The floods in the disaster areas of western Liaoning have receded. The affected masses have all been rescued after the vigorous efforts of the Northeast People's Government, the People's Liberation Army troops, and the people of various places, and have been properly resettled by the People's Government.

This time, due to torrential mountain floods in the upper reaches of the Liao River, the river overflowed, causing a flood of unprecedented magnitude in decades. The disaster affected Kaiyuan, Tieling, Xinmin, Liaozhong, Tai'an, and other counties, as well as parts of the suburbs of Shenyang.

The Finance Department of the Northeast People's Government has allocated a large amount of relief grain and 25,000 sets of clothes to help the victims. The Ministry of Health has also transferred hundreds of medical personnel from various places, carrying a large number of medical equipment to the disaster area to provide free medical treatment for the victims.

In the rescue work, the Communist Party members, government working cadres, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and people from all over the country demonstrated a high degree of mutual assistance and friendship. They often rushed to the most dangerous places, risking their lives to rescue the victims, thus greatly reducing the loss of life and property caused by the floods. For example, Qiu Youwen, Vice Chairman of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government, originally led the rescue work in Tieling, but when the floodwaters receded in Tieling and Xinmin was in emergency, he immediately rushed to Xinmin to direct the masses to move quickly to higher ground. Xia Shangzhi, Director of the Liaoxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, who was in charge of the rescue work in Kaiyuan, waded more than 30 li to the heavily affected area to direct the rescue. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Kaiyuan took the initiative to propose the slogan "We have people, we have materials" to the local People's Government when the floods broke out. They fully participated in the rescue work, and quickly organized all the soldiers who could swim, rescuing more than 1,000 victims in two days by swimming. The People's Air Force also braved the harsh weather, delivering relief supplies to the disaster area from morning till night for days. The boatmen who went to participate in the rescue work also worked tirelessly, day and night, to actively rescue their compatriots. The rescued victims were all extremely grateful, saying: "Thanks to the government and army led by Chairman Mao for saving us. Otherwise, if the floods had come so violently, where would we have had our lives during the puppet Manchukuo and Kuomintang rule!"

Now, the rescued victims have all been settled in disaster relief stations or in the homes of residents in non-disaster areas, and the People's Government provides food. The floods in the submerged areas of Kaiyuan, Tieling, Xinmin, Liaozhong, and the suburbs of Shenyang have now completely receded, and the floodwaters have been channeled into the main stream of the Liao River from Tai'an, Panshan, and other places. At present, in addition to continuing to transfer materials and help the victims resume production, the People's Governments in various disaster areas, under the leadership of the Civil Affairs Department of the Northeast People's Government, are also starting to conduct a detailed survey of the disaster situation in order to properly plan relief measures and help the victims rebuild their homes.

　　华北部分地区遭受严重水旱虫灾
    各地农民奋力抗灾争取提高年成
    辽西洪水已退人民政府妥善安置灾民
    华北全区约七千万亩秋禾遭受旱灾、虫灾和水灾，部分地区灾情相当严重。如察哈尔省春种以后一直无雨，到七月中旬才下雨，旱的程度是十几年来少有的。但是整个夏季，在人民政府的领导下，广大农民向灾害进行了坚韧的斗争，大大地减轻了灾害的程度。
    旱灾最重的察哈尔省，七月中旬下雨以前，约有一千万亩秋禾枯死或半枯。山西省约有三百万亩耕地因旱不能下种或者下了种没有出苗。河北省也有一千七百多万亩秋禾缺雨，其中有六百万亩受旱比较严重。虫灾以棉蚜和蝗虫为多。全区二千七百多万亩棉田有二千三百万亩发生棉蚜。河北省打完夏蝻又有秋蝻，且较普遍。平原省遭受到水灾。该省西部山地因七月底和八月初的暴雨，冲毁了一些山地梯田。辉县梯田被冲毁了五分之一。平原全省共淹地九百多万亩。此外，山西省和绥远省部分地区曾遭受到风、雹等灾害。
    对于上述各种灾害，华北农民在人民政府的领导下，进行不屈不挠的斗争。察哈尔省七月以来就以抗旱保苗、生产备荒为中心工作。该省省人民政府和各专署曾抽了一千多干部下乡，雁北专区各县有三千干部帮助农民抗旱。为了开渠打井，该省人民银行发了大批水利贷款，据雁北朔县统计，今夏就开了五十道小渠，打了两千眼井。涿鹿县团结渠无水，沿岸农民打了五百眼井，挖出十一个泉水坑。为了补种，该省种籽公司七月间派员在河北、绥远各地买了很多荞麦和菜籽。到七月底共贷出荞麦七十多万斤、菜籽十八万多斤。枯死的田禾，农民组织起来在干部领导下改种。怀来县开始三天就改种了五万多亩，到七月二十五日，全县种荞麦和种菜的计划已完成。凡生长较好的秋禾，政府就组织农民，多锄多上肥，争取多收。怀来全县估计可以提高一成年景。
    河北、平原和山西今年治棉蚜比以往几年都紧张。今夏因为雨少，棉蚜治了又生。各地农民充分发挥了治虫的坚韧精神。河北省百分之七十的棉田都治过两三遍，多的治了八、九遍。现在，华北已普遍下雨，棉蚜的威胁基本上已经过去了。治蚜的结果，多数地区的棉田仍可争取丰收。河北省大部分县发生过夏蝻，但都扑灭了。现在，河北农民正在扑打秋蝻。发生秋蝻的田禾有一百七十多万亩，截至八月中旬已经有一百一十多万亩的秋蝻被消灭了。为了和害虫作斗争，各地人民政府发放了无数的除虫药剂和器械，中央人民政府并派出飞机协助。今夏全华北用于扑打害虫的人工有一万万多个。
    平原省为防止水灾扩大，省人民政府已于七月底发出防汛、排水的紧急指示，并已于八月上旬派工作队下乡，领导防汛、排水、补种等工作。对已成灾的部分地区，省人民政府已拨一百万斤粮食进行急赈。为解决补种晚秋作物的种籽，该省人民银行决定发放三十亿元的种籽贷款。现在，许多被淹的田禾都已救出，有的已进行补种。仅据菏泽县八月五日的统计，就已救出被淹田禾四万多亩。
    华北农民在人民政府领导下和灾害斗争是有经验的。今年，广大农民在爱国主义的教育下，战胜灾害的意志更加坚强。发生灾害的初期，他们仍然奋力争取完成今年的丰产计划。部分已成灾减产的地区，农民就奋力争取提高年成，缩小灾害，并开始节约备荒和发展副业生产。

    辽西水灾区洪水已退，受灾群众经东北人民政府、人民解放军部队及各地人民大力抢救后，现已全部脱险，并已得到人民政府妥善安置。
    此次辽河上游因山洪暴发，河水漫溢，造成了数十年来所未有的大水灾，灾情曾扩及开原、铁岭、新民、辽中、台安等县，以及沈阳近郊的部分地区。
    东北人民政府财政部曾拨出大批救济粮食和衣服两万五千套救济灾民。卫生部亦从各地抽调出数百名医务人员，携带大批医药器材前往灾区为灾民义务治病。
    在抢救工作中，各地的共产党员、政府工作干部、人民解放军战士和各地人民，都发挥了高度的互助友爱精神。他们常常跑到水势最危急的地方去，奋不顾身地抢救灾民，因而使洪水所造成的生命财产的损失大大减轻。例如，辽西省人民政府副主席仇友文原来在铁岭领导抢救工作，但当铁岭水势减退新民告急时，他又立即赶到新民指挥群众迅速迁往高地。在开原领导抢救工作的辽西省农林厅厅长夏尚志曾涉水三十多里奔往重灾区指挥抢救。驻守开原的人民解放军某部，当洪水暴发时，立即主动向当地人民政府提出：“要人有人，要物资有物资”的口号，全力参加抢救工作，并迅速组织了所有会游泳的战士，在两天内泅水救出一千多个灾民。人民空军也冒着恶劣的气候，连日从早到晚向灾区运送救济物资。各地前往参加抢救工作的水手，也废寝忘食、日以继夜地积极抢救灾胞。脱险灾民都感激万分地说：“多亏毛主席所领导的政府和军队来打救我们，不然，洪水来得这样猛烈，要是在伪满和国民党统治时期，那里还有我们的活命啊！”
    现在，各地脱险灾民都已分别被安置在灾民招待站或非灾区居民的家中，食用概由人民政府供给。开原、铁岭、新民、辽中等县和沈阳市郊被淹地区的洪水现已全部退落，洪水已由台安、盘山等地纳入辽河正流。目前，各灾区人民政府除继续调运物资、帮助灾民恢复生产外，并在东北人民政府民政部的领导下，着手详细调查灾情，以便妥筹救济办法，帮助灾民重整家园。
