　　US Progressive Party Proposes Joint Election Platform
　　Resolves to Unite American Democratic Forces to Fight for Peace and Democratic Rights

　　(Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 23rd) The National Committee of the US Progressive Party recently held a meeting, deciding to form an election campaign alliance with all forces in the country advocating peace and democracy for the 1952 election, and proposed a joint campaign platform.

　　According to a TASS dispatch from New York on August 21st: The Progressive Party National Committee passed a "Statement on 1952 Election Policy." The core of the statement is to strive for peace. The statement said: "The American people are increasingly expressing deep dissatisfaction and resistance to war plans and their consequences. This situation has already been manifested in the people's intensified demand to stop the Korean War. Under the conditions of the struggle for peace spreading all over the world, the American people, by forcing the US government to conduct ceasefire negotiations, can not only force the government to stop war actions, but also force the government to take new steps to conduct negotiations on guaranteeing genuine peace."

　　The Progressive Party's statement pointed out that the Democratic and Republican parties are striving more than ever to create a war economy, maintain huge armaments, and trample on civil rights and freedoms. They are all using terror and hysteria to profit for monopoly capitalists. Their policies are heading towards two disasters: depression and war. Therefore, the Progressive Party believes that in the 1952 election, there should be candidates who defend the cause of peace, in order to guarantee that the American people's desire to strive for peace, oppose the war economy, demand improved lives, and fight for freedom can be expressed.

　　The Progressive Party's statement said that such a presidential candidate and his platform should represent all peace forces in the country. Therefore, the Progressive Party advocates putting forward an independent candidate list supported by an alliance composed of all groups and individuals who support a genuine peace policy, and suggests the following four points as the basis for this election alliance's list:

　　1. In order to stop the Korean War, the United States should initiate sincere negotiations between the five major powers in order to peacefully resolve disputed issues.

　　2. Restore a peacetime economy; drastically reduce military spending; effectively control prices and profits; stop freezing wages; and formulate a budget that guarantees the people's well-being based on these principles.

　　3. Stop discrimination against black residents and guarantee full legal protection of people's rights.

　　4. End McCarthyism, McCarranism, McGrathism, and Taft-Hartleyism. Repeal the Smith Act and restore the Bill of Rights.

　　The Progressive Party National Committee also decided to establish two special committees to be responsible for the election affairs of the president and members of Congress respectively.

　　The Progressive Party National Committee meeting also passed a resolution on democratic rights, which called for the most resolute struggle against the government's persecution measures, especially against the large-scale arrests carried out in accordance with the notorious Smith Act.

　　The Progressive Party National Committee decided to send a telegram to President Truman requesting the establishment of peace in Korea.

　　美进步党提出竞选共同纲领
    决团结美国民主力量  争取和平及民主权利
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国进步党全国委员会最近开会，决定与全国一切主张和平民主的力量成立一九五二年选举竞选联盟，并提出了竞选的共同纲领。
    据塔斯社纽约二十一日消息：进步党全国委员会通过了“关于一九五二年竞选政策的声明”。声明的主旨是争取和平。声明说：“美国人民对战争计划及其后果日益表示深切的不满与反抗。这种情形已经从人民之加紧要求停止朝鲜战争一事表现出来了。在争取和平的斗争遍及全世界的条件下，美国人民迫使美国政府进行停火谈判，他们不仅可以迫使政府停止战争行动，而且可以迫使政府采取新的步骤来进行关于保障真正和平的谈判。”
    进步党的声明指出，民主党和共和党比以往任何时期都更努力于制造战争经济，保持庞大军备，蹂躏公民权利和自由。它们都借恐怖与歇斯底里之助为垄断资本家牟利。它们的政策走向两个灾难：萧条与战争。因此，进步党认为，在一九五二年选举中，应该有捍卫和平事业的候选人，以保证美国人民争取和平、反对战争经济、要求改善生活、争取自由的愿望得以表示出来。
    进步党的声明说，这样一个总统的候选人及其纲领应该代表全国一切和平力量，因此，进步党主张提出一个得到由一切拥护真正和平政策的团体与个人组成的联盟支持的独立的候选人名单，并建议以下列四点作为这个选举联盟的名单的基础：
    一、为了停止朝鲜战争，美国应该发起五大国的真诚谈判，以便和平解决争执的问题。
    二、恢复平时经济；急剧削减军备支出；有效地管制物价与利润；停止冻结工资；根据这些原则编制保证人民幸福的预算。
    三、停止对黑种居民的歧视，保证在立法上充分保障人民权利。
    四、结束麦克锡主义、麦卡伦主义、麦格拉斯主义和塔夫脱——哈特莱主义。废除史密斯法，恢复权利法案。
    进步党全国委员会并决定设立两个特别委员会分别负责总统及国会议员的竞选事宜。
    进步党全国委员会会议还通过了一项关于民主权利的决议，其中号召进行最坚决的斗争，反对政府的迫害措施，特别是反对按照臭名远扬的史密斯法所进行的大规模逮捕。
    进步党全国委员会决定致电杜鲁门总统，要求在朝鲜确立和平。
