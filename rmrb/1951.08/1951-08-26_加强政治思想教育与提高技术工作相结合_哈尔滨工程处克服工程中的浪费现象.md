Strengthening Political Thought Education Combined with Improving Technical Work
Harbin Engineering Office Overcomes Waste in Projects

The construction projects of the Harbin Engineering Office of the Northeast Industrial Department Construction Engineering Company in 1951, due to the improvement of the ideological consciousness of all employees, have basically eliminated phenomena such as poor project quality and serious waste. Since construction began in late May, the general project quality has met standard requirements. For example, bricklaying projects are lined on both sides, and the bricks are laid horizontally and vertically, with basically no unevenness. More importantly, the grout is full (poured once per layer), and the red bricks are thoroughly soaked, truly meeting the requirements of being strong and durable. Reinforced concrete projects are not only evenly compacted but also have no honeycomb or pitted surfaces, are smooth and flat, and the sand and gravel are washed clean and the proportions are accurate. Steel projects have solid and qualified rivets, with less than 3% rejects. Carpentry projects and other projects have also greatly improved.

In 1950, material waste at the construction site was extremely serious. Cement was everywhere. A lot of wood was burned and shortened (burned by workers for cooking). Broken bricks and tiles were everywhere. At the same time, serious losses were caused by improper storage, such as cement hardening from rain. However, this year, due to the timely education and rewards given by the leadership and the attention paid by the vast majority of employees to the protection of state property, the phenomenon of waste has been basically eliminated at the construction site. For example, during the rainy season when mixing cement, it rained on and off every day, but whenever it rained, the workers put everything aside and covered the cement first, so during the construction period, there was not a single instance of wasting a bag of cement due to improper storage. The carpenters on site not only did not burn any wood, but also the workers and supervisors did not use large materials for small purposes, and made full use of whatever could be used, saving lumber. For example, some groups saved as much as two cubic meters. The First Engineering Team saved 304 kilograms of nails by rationalizing suggestions and picking up old nails to use. The Third Engineering Team did not collect nails from the warehouse for two days when supporting formwork, but instead used nails removed from dismantled formwork. There was very little waste of red bricks and mortar for bricklaying. All of the above has become a common phenomenon at the construction sites of each team. At the same time, many new creations have emerged among all workers and technicians. For example, Su Changyou's three-person assembly line bricklaying method (skilled workers lay the outer skin, third-grade skilled workers lay the inner skin, and ordinary workers fill the grooves with grout). This not only saves skilled bricklayers but also ensures quality, improves work efficiency, and trains apprentices. Another example is carpenter Zhao Fengru's assembly line method, riveter Yang Chengfu's handover system, etc. Technical personnel also came up with many rationalization proposals, thereby improving quality and saving raw materials. The main reasons for the gains made in these areas in 1951 were the implementation of the principle of combining political and ideological leadership with technical work, the in-depth mobilization of the masses, and the adoption of some specific management measures.

Since the beginning of project preparation in 1951, attention has been paid to ideological education on enterprise management and quality improvement in basic construction projects. For example, based on the work summary of 1950, cost management and technical management measures and regulations for ensuring quality were proposed, and these measures and regulations were studied and researched among all employees. For example, more than 20 days were spent in April discussing and studying, clarifying the important significance of the regulations and how to master and implement them. In particular, it was stipulated that the engineering team should be the unit of economic accounting, and at the same time, political and ideological education on resisting America and aiding Korea, loving the motherland, and defending peace was carried out. Therefore, the ideological foundation for doing a good job in basic construction was initially laid in the minds of all employees.

In May, in conjunction with project preparation, education on vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries was carried out, and a mass movement was formed, and the political awareness and production enthusiasm of employees were further improved. A movement to formulate patriotic pledges by groups was launched, and a patriotic labor competition was launched. In order to give the competition a specific goal to strive for, the leadership proposed to resist America and aid Korea through practical actions such as improving quality and eliminating waste. This not only gave all employees a relatively clear and practical goal to strive for in their minds, but also truly recognized the important significance of improving quality and eliminating waste in creating wealth for the country. In order to deepen the quality improvement movement, we also combined the development of the movement to study and discuss relevant documents on improving quality, and held two special quality meetings to solve some incorrect and vague ideological problems in improving quality, such as workers being afraid that technicians would not explain clearly; some technicians believing that the materials were not good and the workers' skills were low, and being afraid that the workers would not listen to the technicians' instructions, and the different operations between the north and the south; some believing that ensuring quality depended solely on supervisors and not on mobilizing workers, etc. These ideological problems were resolved through discussion and criticism at the meeting. This laid a good foundation for the quality competition movement. In addition to paying attention to strengthening political and ideological education, some specific measures were also taken in administrative and technical management. For example, after resolving several incorrect understandings about improving quality, technical personnel and experienced veteran workers immediately discussed and formulated operating methods and quality standards. The workers were then universally launched to discuss and study, and the opinions of the workers were solicited, collected, supplemented and revised, which further resolved specific ideological concerns. In order to further implement the operating methods and ensure quality, the operating methods were transformed into regulations, and when signing piecework contracts, the operating methods were included in the contract as an important part of the contract. In addition, samples and detailed drawings were made in advance for workers to discuss. In the on-site construction units, the supervisory responsibility system was thoroughly and clearly implemented. Each project has a dedicated construction worker and a finished product is labelled. For example, when mixing cement pillars, the labels indicate who is supervising and which worker group is working, and then regular inspections are carried out.

In addition, worker representative meetings should be established and held well in the engineering teams to implement democratic management. We have held this form of meeting once, and it has played a considerable role in ensuring quality and progress. This form is also better when applied to basic construction projects, because it can not only put forward many rationalized management suggestions to help the leadership improve their work, but also play a bridging and leading role in mobilizing the masses.

However, there are still some shortcomings in the Harbin Engineering Office in terms of project quality and material use. The main reason is that the quality competition movement is not led well enough. Individual engineering teams are not very enthusiastic in launching the movement, and some, although they have launched it, have a phenomenon of being tight at the beginning and loose at the end. In the future, the main thing is to further promote the patriotic competition covenant more deeply, and consciously guide the movement to mutual guarantee and cooperation between workers and workers, and between workers and management personnel, which will greatly promote the project.

### 加强政治思想教育与提高技术工作相结合  哈尔滨工程处克服工程中的浪费现象

　　加强政治思想教育与提高技术工作相结合
    哈尔滨工程处克服工程中的浪费现象
    东北工业部建设工程公司哈尔滨工程处一九五一年的建筑工程，由于全体职工思想觉悟的提高，基本上消灭了工程质量低劣及严重浪费等现象。自五月下旬开工以来，一般的工程质量是合乎标准要求的。如砌砖工程均是两面挂线，砌的横平竖直，基本上没有凸凹现象，更重要的是灌浆饱满（每层灌一次），红砖浸得透，真正达到了坚固耐久的要求；钢筋混凝土工程不但捣固均匀，而且没有蜂窝麻面，光滑平整，沙石洗得干净，比例准确；钢铁工程，铆钉坚固合格，废品在百分之三以下；木工工程及其他工程项目亦有很大提高。
    在一九五○年施工现场的材料浪费极其严重。洋灰满地都是；木材烧掉和截短的非常之多（工人做饭烧的）；碎砖、破瓦到处都有；同时因保管不当遭到严重损失，如洋灰雨淋硬化等。但在今年，由于领导干部对这问题采取了及时教育奖励和绝大部分的职工注意对国家财产的爱护，浪费现象在施工现场基本消灭。如雨季打洋灰时，每天雨时下时停，但工人每逢下雨时什么都不顾先把洋灰盖好，所以在施工期间未发生过一次因保管不当而浪费一袋洋灰的现象。现场的木材工人不但一点不烧，而且工人和监工人员都不大材小用，能够利用的就完全利用上，节省成材。如有的组就这样节省二立方公尺之多。第一工程队由于合理化建议及拣旧钉子用，节省三百零四公斤钉子。第三工程队支合子板二天未向仓库领取钉子，都是在拆下的合子板上起着用。红砖和砌砖的洋浆很少有浪费。以上这些，已成为各队工地的普遍现象。同时，在全体工人和技术人员中涌现了不少新的创造。如苏长有的三人流水砌砖法（技工砌外皮，三等技工砌里皮，普通工人填槽灌浆）。这样不但节省技术瓦工，而且保证了质量，提高了工作效率，也带了徒弟。又如木工赵凤如的流水作业法，铆工队杨成富的交接制等。在技术人员中，也有很多合理化建议，从而提高了质量，节省了原材料等。一九五一年在这些方面有收获，主要的是贯彻了政治思想领导和技术工作相结合的方针，深入地发动了群众，并采取了一些管理上的具体措施。
    一九五一年自开始工程准备以来，就注意了关于基本建设工程上的企业化管理和提高质量的思想教育工作。例如根据一九五○年工作总结，提出了成本管理及保证质量的技术管理措施规程，并把这些措施规程在全体职工中进行学习研究。如四月份花费了二十多天的时间进行了讨论学习，弄清了规程的重要意义和如何掌握贯彻。特别是规定了以工程队为经济核算单位，同时又结合着进行了抗美援朝爱祖国及保卫和平的政治思想教育。因此在全体职工的思想上初步地奠定了搞好基本建设的思想基础。
    在五月份，又结合着工程准备工作，进行了大张旗鼓镇压反革命的教育，并形成了群众性的运动，职工的政治觉悟及生产情绪提高了一步。随着掀起了制订小组爱国公约运动，展开了爱国主义劳动竞赛。为了使竞赛运动有具体的奋斗目标，领导方面提出以提高质量，消灭浪费等实际行动抗美援朝。这样不但使全体职工在思想上有了比较明确而又切合实际的奋斗目标，而且真正认清了提高质量、消灭浪费就是给国家创造财富的重要意义。为了使提高质量运动能深入一步，我们又结合着运动的开展，学习讨论了关于提高质量的有关文件，并召开了两次质量专题会议，解决了提高质量的一些不正确的模糊的思想问题，如工人怕技术人员交代不清；技术人员有的认为材料不好工人技术低，怕工人不听技术人员的指挥，南北方操作不一；有的认为保证质量单靠监工而不必依靠发动工人等等。这些思想问题经过会议讨论批判得到了解决。这样就给质量竞赛运动打下了良好基础。除注意加强了政治思想教育之外，在行政技术管理上亦采取了一些具体措施。如在解决了关于对提高质量的几个不正确的认识之后，立即由技术人员和有经验的老工人讨论拟定操作方法和质量标准。又在工人中普遍地展开讨论学习，并且征求工人的意见，把工人的意见搜集起来加以充实修改，这样就更进一步地解决了具体的思想顾虑问题。为了更进一步地贯彻操作方法，保证质量，把操作方法变为法规，于是在订立计件合同时，把操作方法订在合同内作为合同的重要内容。除此之外，又事先作出样品和放出大样详细图叫工人讨论。在现场施工单位里，彻底明确地贯彻了监工责任制。每一项工程均有专责施工员，并实行了成品挂牌制。如打洋灰柱子都写牌子说明谁监工，那个工人小组作，随后定期检查。
    另外在工程队要建立与开好工人代表会，实行民主化管理。此种形式的会议我们已开过一次，对保证质量和进度都有相当的作用。这样一种形式运用到基本建设工程上来也是比较好的，因为他不但能够提出很多合理化的管理意见帮助领导上改进工作，而且对发动群众起着桥梁和带头作用。
    但哈尔滨工程处在工程质量和材料使用上仍然还存在着一些缺点。主要原因是对质量竞赛运动领导得不够。个别工程队发动的劲头不大，有的虽发动起来，却有前紧后松的现象。今后主要的是要把爱国竞赛公约更深入地推进一步，把运动有意识地引导到工人与工人、工人与管理人员的互相保证配合上来，这样对工程有很大推动作用。
