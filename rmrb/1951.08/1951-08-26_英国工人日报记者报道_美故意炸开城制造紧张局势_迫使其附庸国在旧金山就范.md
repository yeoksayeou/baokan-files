Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: A report from Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British *Worker's Daily*, datelined Kaesong, August 24th: The bombing and strafing of the Korean armistice negotiation conference area and the headquarters of the Korean and Chinese delegations can only be seen as the United States preparing to break off the negotiations. This situation has been very obvious since the US side instigated one increasingly serious provocation after another over a long period. Their liaison officer, Air Force Colonel Kinney, perfunctorily glanced at the evidence at night, refused to complete the investigation, and then hurriedly ran over to say "much ado about nothing." These circumstances undoubtedly indicate that the United States knew about this incident beforehand and was determined to force the Korean and Chinese sides to take the most serious steps. In addition to bomb fragments, unexploded gasoline bombs, and strafed houses, there are more than 10,000 residents of Kaesong and all members of the Korean and Chinese delegations who can prove that Kinney was lying. The reporter was only a few hundred yards away from where the bombs landed and witnessed the entire process.

From the beginning, the US side indicated that they wanted to make this a "fictitious incident," an incident they arranged. When they were contacted by telephone, their liaison officer bluntly said: if there were no casualties, they did not want to investigate. From that moment on, Kinney behaved like a Nazi thug from the movies. He stood with his legs apart, denying all the evidence without even looking at it. Mumbling "it's really inexplicable," expressing his "impatience," he said to Colonel Murray: "Hymie, let's go back." He flatly denied every piece of physical evidence, completely refusing to investigate.

They had already started to walk back when they were finally persuaded to turn around again. When he saw the unexploded napalm bomb, Kinney looked flustered for the first time and demanded that journalists leave. He said to Murray: "Hymie, it's too dark here. Let's get out of here."

The current situation here appears to be that the US's actions for a peace treaty with Japan require a bad climate. Peace in the Far East or anywhere else is the last thing the United States wants. They are prepared to sacrifice countless more lives to force their vassal states to submit in San Francisco.

    美故意炸开城制造紧张局势  迫使其附庸国在旧金山就范
    【新华社二十五日讯】英国《工人日报》记者阿兰·魏宁顿二十四日自开城报道：朝鲜停战谈判会议地区与朝、中代表团总部遭到轰炸和扫射，只能看作是美国准备使谈判决裂。自从美方在很长一个时期中接二连三地策动一个比一个严重的挑衅事件以来，这种情形就已经表现得很明显了。他们的联络官空军上校肯尼在夜里懒洋洋地匆匆看了一眼证物，拒绝把调查工作进行到结束，然后又赶忙跑来说了一声“无中生有的事”。这些情形无疑地指明了美国事先就知道这桩事件，决意逼得朝、中方面除了采取最严重的步骤之外没有其他的道路可走。除了炸弹片，未炸的汽油弹和被扫射的房子之外，还有开城的一万多居民，朝中代表团的全体人员都可以证明肯尼是在撒谎。记者离炸弹落地的地方仅仅几百码，亲眼看到全部的经过情形。
    从一开头起，美方就表示他们要使这件事成为一个“虚构的事件”，他们所安排的虚构的事件。和他们通电话的时候，他们的联络官干脆地说：假使没有什么伤亡的话，他们不想来调查。从那一刻起，肯尼的举止就像银幕上的纳粹小头目一样。他两腿分开地站着，看也不看一眼就否定了一切证据。嘴里叨念着“真是莫名其妙”，表示他的“不耐烦”，他对穆莱上校说：“希姆，我们回去吧”。他断然否认每一个物证，完全拒绝调查。
    他们已经往回走了一程，最后还是被说服又折回来，当他看到那颗没有爆炸的凝结汽油弹的时候，肯尼第一次露出了神色张皇的样子，要求新闻记者离开。他对穆莱说：“希姆，这里太黑了。让我们离开这里吧”。
    目前的形势在这里看起来，美国对日媾和的行动需要一种恶劣的气候，远东或其他任何地方的和平都是美国所最不愿意的事情，他们准备再牺牲无数的生命来迫使他们的附庸国在旧金山就范。
