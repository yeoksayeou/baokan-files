    The Fourth Session of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Jiyuan County
    Exhibited Extravagance and Waste
    Similar Phenomena Should be Avoided in Convening Meetings in Various Localities
To the Editors:
    After reading the article "How the Fourth Session of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Jiyuan County Was Held" in the People's Daily on July 27th, we felt that the People's Representative Conference, which exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, was well-conducted, and the experiences reported are worth learning from in various localities. However, according to what we know, the county exhibited extravagance such as formalism and ostentation in convening this People's Representative Conference. We believe that this extravagant practice is wrong, and other localities should avoid similar phenomena when convening People's Representative Conferences.
    According to what we have heard: Before the Fourth Session of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Jiyuan County was convened, the town of Chengguan in the county "used yellow soil to pave the roads, sprinkled water on the streets, cleaned the storefronts, updated the shop signs, rectified the market, and hung lanterns and decorations." The county People's Government also issued a notice stating: "All villages within fifteen miles of the city, men, women, old and young, must be organized to participate in the conference (referring to the celebration conference - the author), and must bring musical instruments, carry lanterns and decorations, put on costumes for propaganda, organize various recreational activities...; Villages more than fifteen miles away from the city should, depending on the situation, organize costume propaganda, carry lanterns and decorations, hold parades, and convene mass rallies to celebrate in the form of joint villages or villages and neighborhoods." During the People's Representative Conference, "teams of students and masses, accompanied by drums and music, carrying congratulatory gifts and letters, successively poured into the county government gate... the sound of gongs and drums filled the air, mixed with the laughter of the people, making it impossible for the conference to continue." "At the celebration meeting, there were more than 20,000 people, braving the rain to attend," and "presented the newly appointed county head with a Zhongshan suit and a shirt, and a pair of shoes." According to statistics, this People's Representative Conference received more than 200 congratulatory banners and more than 2,100 congratulatory letters from various villages and people from all walks of life, more than 8,000 eggs, as well as pork, Luzhou liquor, painted plaques, paper flowers, etc. The gifts given to the conference by various agencies were also numerous: the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government donated 6,500 jin of rice and three sets of popular books; the Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office donated two sets of books; the Jiyuan County People's Government donated 5,000 jin of millet and a banner; and the Women's Federation donated 33 notebooks and 29 pencils.
    Using the People's Representative Conference to exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress is an important step in improving the county People's Representative Conference, and its purpose is to further advance the democratization of county administration. When convening such a meeting, emphasis should be placed on the higher legal authority vested in it than ordinary People's Representative Conferences, and consideration should be given to how to make the meeting more democratic; it should not be overly concerned with formalities. The extravagant practices of Jiyuan County caused a waste of manpower and financial resources, and delayed the production and work of the masses (and at that time it was the spring plowing season), which is not in line with the demands of the people. If some people are happy to do so, the People's Government should also persuade and dissuade them.

### 济源县第四届各界人民代表会议  有铺张浪费的现象  各地召开会议应避免同类现象发生

    济源县第四届各界人民代表会议
    有铺张浪费的现象
    各地召开会议应避免同类现象发生编辑同志：
    我们阅过七月二十七日人民日报“济源县第四届各界人民代表会议是怎样召开的”一文后，感到该县这次代行人民代表大会职权的人民代表会议是开得好的，报导的这些经验也都是值得各地吸取的。但根据我们所知，该县在召开这次人民代表会议中，曾有摆形式、闹排场等铺张现象。我们认为这种铺张作法是不对的，其他各地在召开人民代表会议时应避免同类现象发生。
    据我们所听到的：济源县第四届各界人民代表会议召开前，该县城关镇曾以“黄土垫道，清水洒街，洗刷门面，更新字号，整顿市场，挂灯结彩。”该县人民政府并曾发出通知说：“凡离城十五里以内之村庄，男女老少都要有组织的来参加大会（指庆祝大会——笔者），并要带乐器，提灯结彩，化装宣传，组织各种游艺……；离城十五里以外之村庄，要根据情况，以联村或村、闾为单位组织化装宣传，提灯结彩，举行游行，召开群众大会庆贺之。”在人民代表会议进行中曾有“一队一队的学生和群众，伴随着鼓乐，带着贺仪、贺信，相继涌进了县府大门……锣鼓喧天，夹杂着人们的说笑声，使大会不能再继续进行。”“庆祝会上，即有两万余众，锣鼓喧天，冒雨赴会”，并“献给新任县长中山服及衬衣各一套，鞋一双。”据统计，这次人民代表会议共收到各村及各界人民送来的贺幛二百余幅，贺函二千一百余封，鸡蛋八千余个，还有猪肉、潞酒、彩匾、纸花等。各机关赠给大会的礼物也很多：平原省人民政府赠米六千五百斤，大众图书三套；新乡专署赠图书两套；济源县人民政府赠小米五千斤，锦旗一面；妇联会赠笔记本三十三本，铅笔二十九枝。
    以人民代表会议代行人民代表大会的职权，是使县人民代表会议提高一步的重要环节，其目的在使县政民主化向前推进一步。召开此种会议时，应着眼于它比一般的人民代表会议具有法律上付予的更高的职权，应着重考虑如何使会议更能发扬民主；而不应当过分的从形式上去讲究。济源县过分铺张的作法，引起人力、财力的浪费，耽误了群众生产与工作（况且当时正值春耕季节），这是不适合人民要求的。如果有部分群众乐于那样作，人民政府也是应该加以说服与劝阻的。
