　　The CCP Central Committee Central South Bureau Issues Instructions
    Boldly Mobilize Worker Masses to Carry Out Democratic Reform Movement
    The "Instructions on Boldly Mobilizing Worker Masses to Carry Out Democratic Reform Movement" issued by the CCP Central Committee Central South Bureau to its subordinate Party committees at all levels on August 1st, made important expositions on the important significance, objectives, content, and working line of the democratic reform work.

    The instructions stated: The experience of the democratic reform movement in the Central South region over the past two months proves that in factories, mines, industries, and neighborhoods, it is impossible to solve the basic problems of building a people's city without launching a democratic reform movement to eliminate feudal reactionary forces. Although these feudal reactionary forces no longer occupy a dominant position in factories, mines, and cities, and cannot exist legally, they are still hiddenly and stubbornly protecting their reactionary residual "systems" and ways of life on which they depend. Although they are only a residual force, they can still use their historical inheritance and traditional influence, the gangs, factions, and various complex social relations that workers and laborers were forced to participate in during painful years, and the positions they still hold or have stolen, to maintain their power. To deal with such a feudal reactionary force, it is necessary to resolutely, comprehensively, and systematically launch a democratic reform movement. It must be understood that democratic reform is a necessary historical stage for improving old enterprises and building new enterprises, that is, from old enterprises to new enterprises, and it is also a necessary historical stage for workers and laborers to change from their old ruled position to the position of true masters.

    The instructions stated: Based on the two years of working foundation in factories and mining enterprises in the Central South region, the current democratic reform is "making up for missed lessons." Its basic content and purpose are to fully mobilize the worker masses, eliminate feudal reactionary forces, so as to thoroughly reform old enterprises politically, and prepare a solid foundation for enterprise management and democratic management. Specifically, it is necessary to rely on the working class to eliminate all feudal reactionary elements, reactionary systems, and bad work styles within the enterprise, completely eliminate production obstacles, and at the same time establish a set of democratic management systems and democratic work styles from workshops and groups to the factory management committee; guide the political enthusiasm of workers to production, establish new labor attitudes and labor discipline, so that the worker masses become a conscious class team with solid organization, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, complete the task of reforming enterprises, developing production, and various tasks and calls put forward by the People's Government. The instructions pointed out: Since the main purpose of democratic reform is to eliminate production obstacles and timely guide and organize the masses to complete production tasks, it is obviously unfounded for some people to fear that democratic reform will affect production. The content of democratic reform includes breaking the old and building the new, and one must not use the excuse of fearing "chaos" or fearing "smashing the enterprise" to not dare to eliminate all feudal reactionary forces that hinder enterprise management. These feudal reactionary forces are almost always plotting to "mess up" us, and make our construction work fall into chaos. Democratic reform is precisely to fundamentally change this situation.

    The instructions pointed out that the working line of democratic reform is to resolutely rely on the worker masses, unite and transform technicians and staff, strive for all forces that sympathize with and support this reform movement, and form a united front with a strong mass base to eliminate residual feudal reactionary forces in a step-by-step and differentiated manner. The instructions stated that staff and technical personnel are an indispensable and very important part of the factory, they are also laborers, and are part of the working class. Some of them have been affected by the old enterprises and old rule, and have more or less offended the workers, and are therefore dissatisfied with the worker masses. However, except for a very small number of hidden reactionary elements, they have generally done a lot of useful work since liberation, and have made considerable awareness and progress, and after transformation and improvement, they will contribute greater strength. The worker masses generally understand how to unite them and demand to unite them. Dissatisfaction and opinions about some of them can be completely treated as internal problems. But if there are problems, appropriate methods must be taken to solve them. It is wrong to be afraid of the worker masses exposing this contradiction, trying to cover up this contradiction, and even not daring to launch democratic reform because of fear of this contradiction being exposed. In carrying out democratic reform in private factories, efforts should also be made to win the support of capitalists. Because general capitalists are different from bureaucratic capitalists, as long as they are sincerely engaged in industry, they generally want to run their own factories and enterprises well. They have contradictions with the working class, and often, due to feudal social relations, employ some personnel who are not needed for business operations, and sometimes use feudal reactionary forces to maintain "order," which is why they are dissatisfied with the worker masses. However, these feudal reactionary forces and the secret agents under their protection, who have infiltrated the enterprise, are ultimately detrimental to the operation and development of the enterprise. Precisely because of this, it is possible and necessary to win their support.

    According to the above-mentioned guidelines and policies, the instructions pointed out that in the democratic reform movement, the policy boundaries of striking at the enemy, uniting ourselves, opposing feudalism, and protecting capital must be clearly defined. A very cautious attitude must be taken when technicians and skilled workers are involved due to striking at the enemy. In addition to die-hard counter-revolutionary elements who are extremely unpopular and seriously harm the interests of the country, who should be dealt with according to law, they should generally be treated leniently. In private factories, consultation methods must be adopted to win the support of capitalists for democratic reform. It is necessary to distinguish between striking at feudal forces and investigating counter-revolutionary elements from handling general labor-capital disputes and the illegal acts of individual capitalists. In handicraft workshops, it is necessary to distinguish between the oppression of feudal foremen and the relationship between masters and apprentices.

    The instructions pointed out that in all larger state-owned factories and mines, the democratic reform movement can generally take three steps: The first step is to launch an anti-feudal democratic struggle, strike at feudal bosses, gang leaders, and all feudal reactionary elements who do not engage in production, specialize in oppressing and threatening workers, extorting and blackmailing, and exploiting the fruits of workers' labor to enrich themselves, and investigate and eliminate fleeing landlords, despots, and secret agents who are hidden in the factory and among the workers. The second step is to implement democratic unity, that is, to solve the internal problems exposed in the previous step, such as the relationship between staff and workers, the relationship between leaders and the masses, the relationship between new and old workers, the relationship between technical workers and non-technical workers, and the regional and factional issues among workers, through criticism and self-criticism. The third step is to carry out democratic construction, that is, to improve the political awareness of workers, technicians, and staff through summarizing experiences, establish new labor attitudes, rectify and strengthen trade unions, the Youth League, and other organizations, establish a democratic management system, overcome the shortcomings of some workers who may occur in the democratic reform, such as only wanting to struggle and not wanting to work, only wanting to criticize staff and criticize leaders but not respecting management, and then launch a patriotic production competition, sign a patriotic production pledge, and improve business management.

    The instructions also provided detailed explanations on how to mobilize the worker masses and the organizational leadership of the movement in the democratic reform movement.

### 中共中央中南局发布指示  放手发动工人群众开展民主改革运动

　　中共中央中南局发布指示
    放手发动工人群众开展民主改革运动
    中共中央中南局于八月一日向所属各级党委发布的《关于放手发动工人群众开展民主改革运动的指示》，对于民主改革工作的重要意义及其目的、内容和工作路线等问题，作了重要的阐释。
    指示说：两个月来中南区民主改革运动的经验证明：在工厂、矿山、行业、街道中，非要发动一个民主改革运动，借以肃清封建反动势力，是不能解决人民城市建设的基本问题的。这种封建反动势力，在工厂矿山中，在城市中，虽多已不占统治地位，不能合法存在了，但是他们还在隐蔽地顽强地保护着他们赖以为生的反动残余“制度”与生活方法。他们虽只是一种残余势力，但是他们还能利用其历史因袭与传统的影响，利用工人劳动群众在痛苦的年月中被迫参加的帮口、宗派及种种错综的社会关系，利用他们还在保持着或窃取到的职位，以维持其势力。对待这样一种封建反动势力，必须坚决地全盘地有计划有步骤地发动一个民主改革运动。必须了解，民主改革乃是改进旧企业、建设新企业，即由旧企业到新企业的一个必需经过的历史阶段，也就是工人群众由旧日被统治地位改变为真正主人翁的地位所必需经历的历史阶段。
    指示说：根据中南区厂矿企业中已有两年工作基础的情况，目前的民主改革是“补课”性质。其基本内容和目的是充分发动工人群众，肃清封建反动势力，以便从政治上彻底改革旧企业，为经营企业化和管理民主化准备切实的基础。具体地说就是要依靠工人阶级清除企业内部一切封建反动分子、反动制度及恶劣作风，彻底扫除生产障碍，同时确立从车间、小组直至工厂管理委员会一套民主管理制度与民主作风；引导工人的政治热情到生产上来，树立新的劳动态度和劳动纪律，使工人群众成为自觉的有坚固组织的阶级队伍，在共产党领导之下，完成改革企业、发展生产及人民政府所提出的各项任务和号召。指示指出：民主改革的主要目的既是为了扫除生产障碍，并及时引导和组织群众完成生产任务，因此，有些人害怕民主改革影响生产，显然是没有根据的。民主改革的内容包括破除旧的和建设新的两个方面，决不能借口怕“乱”、怕“打烂了企业”，就不敢去破除一切妨害企业经营管理的封建反动势力。这种封建反动势力几乎天天都在谋算着“乱”我们，使我们的建设工作陷于纷扰零乱。民主改革正是为着从根本上改变这种情况。
    指示指出，民主改革的工作路线是坚决地依靠工人群众，团结和改造技师、职员，争取一切同情与赞助这个改革运动的力量，组成一个有强大群众基础的统一战线，有步骤地有区别地清除残余封建反动势力。指示说，职员和技术人员是工厂不可缺少的很重要的一部分力量，他们也是劳动者，是工人阶级的一部分。他们之中的若干人曾经受到旧企业旧统治的影响，或多或少地得罪过工人，因而为工人群众所不满。但是除了极少数暗藏的反动分子以外，他们一般地在解放以后已经作了许多有益的工作，有了相当觉悟与进步，经过改造和提高，将会贡献出更大的力量来。工人群众一般是懂得团结他们，要求团结他们的。对于他们之中的某些人的不满与意见，完全可以作为内部问题予以处理。但既有问题，就必须采取适当方式加以解决。害怕工人群众揭露这种矛盾，企图掩盖这种矛盾，甚至因为害怕这种矛盾被揭露而不敢去发动民主改革则是错误的。在私营工厂中进行民主改革，亦应争取资本家的赞助与支持。因为一般资本家与官僚资本家不同，只要他们是真心办工业的，一般都愿意办好他们自己的工厂企业。他们与工人阶级有矛盾，又往往因封建的社会关系，引用了一些经营企业所不需要的人员，有时也利用过封建反动势力以维持“秩序”，因而为工人群众所不满。但是，这些封建反动势力及其掩护下的特务分子，钻入企业，对于企业的经营和发展毕竟是不利的。正是因为这样，所以有可能也必须争取他们的赞助与支持。
    根据上述方针路线，指示指出：在民主改革运动中，必须划清打击敌人、团结自己、反对封建、保护资本的政策界限。凡因打击敌人而牵涉到技师、技工时，必须采取很谨慎的态度。除民愤极大、极严重的危害国家利益的死心反革命分子应依法处办外，一般均应从宽处理。在私营工厂，必须采取协商办法，争取资本家赞助民主改革。必须将打击封建势力、清查反革命分子与处理一般的劳资争议及个别资本家的违法行为区别开来。在手工业工场、作坊，必须把封建把头的压迫与师徒关系分别开来。
    指示指出：在一切较大的公营工厂、矿山中，民主改革运动大体可以采取三个步骤：第一步发动反封建的民主斗争，打击封建把头、帮会头子及一切不事生产、专事压迫威胁工人、进行勒索敲诈、剥削工人劳动所得以自肥的封建反动分子，清查隐藏在工厂中工人中的逃亡地主恶霸及特务破坏分子。第二步实行民主团结，即将前一步骤中所暴露出来的内部问题，例如职员和工人的关系、领导与群众的关系、新老工人的关系、技术工人与非技术工人的关系以及工人当中的地域、帮派等问题，采取批评与自我批评的办法予以解决。第三步进行民主建设，即用总结经验的方法提高工人群众和技师、职员的政治觉悟，树立新的劳动态度，整顿与加强工会、青年团及其他组织，确立民主管理制度，克服某些工人在民主改革中所可能发生的只想斗争不想劳动、只想批评职员批评领导而不尊重管理的缺点，然后发动爱国生产竞赛，订立爱国生产公约，改善经营管理。
    指示中对于在民主改革运动中如何发动工人群众以及运动的组织领导方面的问题，亦作了详细的解释。
