　　Our Newspaper Reporters' Dispatches from Kaesong
　　U.S. Side Persists in Unreasonable Demands
　　Causing the Meeting to Reach a Stalemate
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th] Our newspaper correspondents stationed here to cover the armistice negotiation meeting jointly reported: The Kaesong negotiations have fallen into a serious stalemate due to the U.S. imperialism's persistence in unreasonable demands. The people of the world should know the truth. According to a July 31st Agence France-Presse report and authoritative sources, the U.S. delegation proposed at the meeting that a military demarcation line be drawn north of the 38th parallel and the current battle line, that is, between the Yalu River and the current battle line, deep into our positions, and a demilitarized zone be established. Their so-called reasons are: 1. Air and sea superiority should be compensated for on land, so the armistice line should be north of the current battle line; 2. Both sides have defensible positions on this line.
　　These reasons are not worth refuting because: 1. The U.S. side's so-called air and sea superiority is only a violation of international law by indiscriminately bombing peaceful residents. It is an atrocity, not real strength. Moreover, the enemy army relies on air and sea coordination to barely, temporarily, and unstably maintain the current battle line and has no independent air and sea superiority. 2. The armistice is the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, so negotiations should focus on the future peaceful resolution, not on future combat deployments. The U.S. side says that only north of the current battle line are there defensible positions, proving that they only want war and not peace. Moreover, their emphasis on so-called defense and pushing the demarcation line into our military area actually contains the malicious intention of shirking responsibility for aggression and falsely accusing us of being the "aggressor," which is a complete reversal of right and wrong. 3. The so-called security during the armistice period can only be most effectively guaranteed by both parties agreeing to and abiding by the fair and reasonable 38th parallel proposed by our side as the demarcation line.
　　Our side's insistence on the 38th parallel as the demarcation line is the fairest and most reasonable and in line with the military reality of the battlefield. The reasons are: 1. This year, our army advanced south of the 38th parallel twice, and the enemy crossed north of the line twice. 2. In seven months, our army was south of the 38th parallel for about five months, and the enemy was north of the line for more than two months. 3. The current battle line is unstable and does not reflect the military reality, while the 38th parallel best reflects the military reality. 4. Our army occupies 145 kilometers along the 38th parallel, and the enemy occupies 165 kilometers. Our army occupies 3,630 square kilometers south of the line, and the enemy occupies 4,630 square kilometers north of the line. The line and area are almost the same, so it is fairest to demarcate at the 38th parallel.
　　Taking the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line is also conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue because: 1. The armistice is the first step toward a peaceful resolution, so it cannot be based solely on military considerations but must focus on future peace. 2. The 38th parallel is only a military demarcation, not a division of Korea into two. The Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves after the withdrawal of all foreign troops. 3. The Chinese people began to organize volunteer troops to resist aggression when the U.S. military disregarded international law and the opposition and warnings of the Chinese people and crossed the 38th parallel to approach the Yalu River, directly threatening China's security. Therefore, to restore peace, there must be an armistice at the 38th parallel. 4. The armistice negotiations were initiated by Malik's proposal, which suggested that both sides withdraw from the 38th parallel.
　　During the negotiations, the U.S. side strengthened its air and naval bombardment and intensified its ground offensives, attempting to exert pressure and intimidation on us. To cover up its bellicose behavior, the U.S. side even fabricated rumors that the two sides had agreed at the meeting that fighting would continue during the negotiations. According to authoritative sources, there was no such agreement at the meeting. The U.S. side's increase in military operations during the negotiations is not in line with the peace aspirations of the people of the world.
　　The U.S. delegation raised this arrogant and unreasonable demand after the agenda was agreed upon on July 26th but has not dared to disclose it to its reporters and the world, fearing that it would arouse the just condemnation of world opinion. However, since the 27th, the enemy has not changed its attitude and has not accepted our just demands. This is the reason why the meeting has made no progress to date. The above facts have forcefully illustrated how much sincerity the enemy has. The final conclusion depends entirely on the specific actions of the U.S. representatives and the U.S. forces in the future.

### 我国各报刊记者自开城报道  美方坚持无理要求  致使会议陷于僵局

　　我国各报刊记者自开城报道
    美方坚持无理要求
    致使会议陷于僵局
    【新华社开城五日电】来此间采访停战谈判会议的我国各报刊特派记者联合报道称：开城谈判因美帝国主义坚持无理要求陷入严重停滞情况，世界人民应知真相。据七月三十一日法新社报道和权威方面消息，美方代表团曾在会上提出在三八线及现战线之北，即鸭绿江及现战线之间，深入我阵地之内，划一军事分界线，建立非军事地区。其所谓理由是：一、海空优势应在陆地上取得补偿，故停战线应在现战线以北；二、在此线上双方有可防守之阵地。
    这些理由实不值一驳，因为：一、美方所谓海空优势只是对和平居民作违背国际公法的狂轰滥炸，乃暴行而非真正力量，且敌军靠海空配合始能勉强地、暂时地、不稳定地维持目前战线，并无所谓独立的海空优势。二、停战为和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步，故在谈判时应着重今后之和平解决，不能着重今后之作战部署，美方谓只有在现战线之北有可资防守之阵地，证明其只要战争不要和平。而且他们强调所谓防御并将分界线推入我军地区内，实含有推却侵略责任、反诬我为“侵略者”之恶毒用意，这完全是颠倒是非的。三、所谓停战期间的安全，只有双方协议并遵守我方所提公平和合理的三八线为分界线，才是最有效的安全保障。
    至我方坚持以三八线为分界线，是最公平合理的，且符合战场的军事实际。理由是：一、今年我军进至三八线南二次，敌越至线北二次。二、七个月中，我军在三八线南约五个月，敌在线北二月余。三、现战线并不稳定，不能反映军事实际，而三八线最能反映军事实际。四、我军据三八线一四五公里，敌军据一六五公里，我军占线南三六三零方公里，敌军占线北四六三零方公里，线面均相差无几，故在三八线分界最公平。
    以三八线为军事分界线还有利于朝鲜问题的和平解决。因为：一、停战乃和平解决第一步，故不能单从军事观点出发，必须着眼于今后和平。二、三八线仅作军事分界，并非将朝鲜分裂为二，朝鲜问题应在于一切外国军队撤退后由朝鲜人民自己解决。三、中国人民在美军不顾国际公法及我国人民反对与警告而越过三八线迫近鸭绿江、直接威胁中国安全时，始起而组织志愿军抵抗侵略，故欲恢复和平，自须在三八线停战。四、停战谈判系以马立克之建议发端，其建议即为双方自三八线撤退。
    谈判期间美方加强海空军狂轰滥炸，陆军加紧进攻，妄图对我施用压力及恫吓。为掩饰其好战行为，美方竟造谣谓：双方在会上协议谈判期间还是要打。据权威人士称：会上并无此种协议。美方在谈判期间增加军事行动是不符合全世界人民和平愿望的。
    美方代表团在七月二十六日议程达成协议后，即提出此狂妄无理要求，但迄未敢向其记者及世界透露，害怕引起世界舆论的严正指责。但自二十七日至今八日以来，敌方迄未变更态度，不接受我正义主张，会议至今没有进展的原因就在此。敌方诚意究有多少，上述事实已有力说明，最后结论全视今后美方代表及美方部队的具体行动了。
