Under the Bloody Rule of the American and Japanese Reactionaries
Japanese Students Face Dire Circumstances
Hokkaido Students Oppose American Troops Stationing
[Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Tokyo] News from Tokyo: Under the bloody rule of the American and Japanese reactionaries, the majority of Japanese students must rely on side jobs to maintain their bare minimum living standards. The bourgeois publication *Mainichi* Weekly stated: Among the 170,000 students in Tokyo, approximately 70%, or 120,000, are urgently seeking employment. In one school, students who must engage in side jobs account for 40% of the total student population, reaching over 8,000. The extracurricular career placement office of the "Student Support Association," run by the Yoshida reactionary government's Ministry of Education, receives more than 230 students daily seeking side jobs. Female university students, driven by poverty, resort to selling their physical appearance for a meager reward of 1,000 yen per hour, which cannot even buy half a meter of fabric, by working as nude photography models. Some students earn a living by shining shoes or working as walking advertisements (parading through the streets with advertising boards strapped to their front and back).

Japanese students living in such dire circumstances, in order to survive and study, and to demand peace and democracy, are engaged in continuous struggle despite the persecution by the American and Japanese reactionaries. Students at Hokkaido University participated in the citizens' rally of the Democratic National United Front held in Sapporo, resolving to "oppose the stationing of American troops in Sapporo." Students in the Kyushu region resolved to organize a peace committee, collect signatures demanding an overall peace treaty, oppose tuition increases, the "purge" of progressive professors, and the dispatch of Americans as professors, and to fight for the reduction of military spending and the increase of cultural and educational expenses.

　　在美日反动派血腥统治下
    日本学生境况悲惨
    北海道学生反对美国驻兵
    【新华社三日讯】东京消息：在美日反动派血腥统治之下，日本大部分的学生要靠副业来维持自己最低的生活。资产阶级的《每日》周刊载称：在东京的十七万学生中，急于求职的约占七成，即十二万人。在某一学校内，必须从事副业的学生，占该校学生总数的四成，达八千余名。吉田反动政府文部省（即教育部）所办“学徒援护会”的课外职业介绍所，每天有二百三十多名学生前往寻找副业。女子大学学生因生活所迫，以买不到半公尺衣料的每小时一千元的报酬出卖色相，作裸体照像模特儿。有的学生用擦皮鞋、作活动广告（身前身后背着广告板游街宣传）等方法谋生。
    处于这种悲惨生活中的日本学生，为了要生活、要读书，同时为了要求和平和民主，不顾美、日反动派的迫害，正进行不断的斗争。北海道大学学生曾参加了在扎幌市召开民主民族统一战线市民大会，决议“反对美国兵驻扎扎幌”。九州地方的学生决议组织和平委员会，征集要求全面媾和的签名，反对学费上涨、“整肃”进步教授和派遣美国人担任教授，并为缩减军费增加文教费而斗争。
