    To the Editor:
    I am a family member of a revolutionary soldier from Zaitou Village, Chejiang Township, Rongjiang County, Guizhou. Now I will tell you about my life since liberation.

    After liberation, the lives of us peasants are much better than before. The government takes very good care of us military families. Last New Year's Eve, the township head personally hung a glorious plaque at my door, and the county government even invited military families to a meal.

    During the land reform movement, we were allocated land. Our village confiscated more than 300 dan of surplus grain from the landlords, and my family received two dan. The production enthusiasm of the whole village is very high. The men go to farm the fields, and the women carry manure. Now we have also organized agricultural production mutual aid teams. Organized together, we are developing production. Each mutual aid team has expressed: "We must produce more grain, donate airplanes and artillery, and support the Volunteer Army."

    Recently, I was elected as the chairman of the village women's association, and I feel very honored. I must do my job well, actively lead the masses to step up production, support the front lines, and repay the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. On both sides of the glorious plaque at my door, I hung a couplet that reads, "Chairman Mao is the savior, the Communist Party is the mother," to express my gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    贵州一个军属的欢乐生活编辑同志：
    我是贵州榕江县车江乡寨头村的一个革命军人家属。现在我把解放后的生活情形告诉你们。
    解放后，我们农民的生活比前好得多了。政府对我们军属照顾得很周到。去年除夕，乡长亲自在我家门口挂上光荣匾，县政府还请军属们会餐。
    在土地改革运动中，我们分得了土地，我村并没收了地主多余粮食三百多担，我家就分到了两担。全村人民生产情绪非常高，男的去耕田，女的就担粪。现在我们又组织了生产互助组，组织起来，发展生产。各个互助组都纷纷表示：“一定要多打粮食，捐献飞机大炮，支援志愿军。”
    最近，我被选为本村妇女会主席，我感到非常光荣。我一定要做好工作，积极带动群众加紧生产，支援前线，来报答共产党、毛主席。我在家门口光荣匾的两旁，挂上“毛主席是救星，共产党是母亲”的一副对联，来表示我对共产党毛主席的感谢。
                    贵州榕江县寨头村妇女  石迈（袁通慧代笔）
