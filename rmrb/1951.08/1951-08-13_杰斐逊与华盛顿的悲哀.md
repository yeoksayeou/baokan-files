　　Jefferson and Washington's Sorrow

    This year, July 4th marked the 175th anniversary of the United States' "Declaration of Independence." The New York "Capital Times" presented a petition demanding democratic freedoms, which was entirely composed of excerpts from the "Declaration of Independence" and the U.S. Constitution. A reporter from the newspaper, without revealing the source of the content, sought signatures on the petition. Out of the one hundred and twelve people they approached, only one person indicated a willingness to sign. The "New York Post" conducted a similar test in New York City, and the results were similar to those of the "Capital Times." The main reason given by those who refused to sign was that they would encounter unfortunate consequences if they did so.

    The democracy and freedom that Jefferson and Washington had solemnly guaranteed to the American people have been completely deprived by the likes of Truman and Acheson. The American people are even denied the most basic freedom from fear.

　　杰斐逊与华盛顿的悲哀
    今年七月四日是美国发表“独立宣言”的第一百七十五周年纪念日，纽约《首府时代报》提出了一个要求民主自由的请愿书，其中完全是“独立宣言”和美国宪法的摘录。该报记者不说明其内容的来源，征求人们在请愿书上签名。在他们所征求的一百一十二人中，只有一个人表示愿意签名。《纽约邮报》在纽约市也进行同样的测验，结果与《首府时代报》的情形差不多。拒绝签名者主要的理由是：倘若他们签名的话，他们就会遭遇不幸的后果。
    杰斐逊与华盛顿曾经向美国人民庄严保证过的民主与自由，已被杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流全部剥夺了，美国人民连免于恐惧的起码的自由也不可得了。
