　　Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the 3rd World Youth and Student
    Peace Festival
    Feng Wenbin, Head of the Chinese Youth Delegation
    Dear friends: Our delegation of youth from the People's Republic of China and all Chinese youth, with boundless excitement, welcome the 3rd World Youth and Student Peace Festival. We, the peace-loving Chinese youth, are very happy to be able to once again join with the world's young peace fighters in expressing to the world our firm desire for peace, and to express to all imperialist warmongers our resolute will: "We demand peace!"
    Here, on behalf of the Chinese youth, I extend fraternal greetings to the glorious Soviet youth, the example for all the world's youth! Fraternal greetings to the youth of all people's democratic countries, to our heroic Korean youth friends who are fighting against American imperialist aggression and defending their homeland! Fraternal greetings to the youth friends of colonial and semi-colonial countries who are fighting for the freedom and independence of their homelands, and to the young peace fighters of capitalist countries! We especially want to express our heartfelt thanks to our German youth friends, and thank you for your warm welcome and hospitality to the Chinese delegation, and congratulate the peace-loving German people and youth, under the leadership of President Pieck, for achieving greater victories in the struggle to strive for peace, strive for democratic unification, and oppose American imperialist rearmament of West Germany.
    At present, the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism is preparing for a new world war. In the East, for a year, American imperialism and its accomplices have been carrying out extremely barbaric aggression against the peaceful Korean people, and are intensifying the rearmament of Japan, and shamelessly carrying out a separate peace treaty with Japan. In the West, they are stepping up the rearmament of West Germany, and they are viciously carrying out anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-peace propaganda. The war crisis created by the imperialists is threatening all of humanity. Defending peace is the serious and urgent combat task of the people and youth of the world today. Today, youth from over ninety countries around the world, of different languages, different skin colors, different political and religious beliefs, different classes and different occupations, under the great banner of peace, have broken through and shattered the warmongers' attempts to obstruct us in every possible way, and convened the 3rd World Youth and Student Peace Festival in Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, the outpost of the European peace struggle. Without a doubt, this is a great review of our peace-loving forces, this is a victory for peace. This fact shows that the youth of the world have a fervent desire for peace, and have a strong will and determination to fight for peace.
    The Chinese youth, under the guidance of the great Chairman Mao Zedong, love peace and also know how to strive for peace and defend peace. The American imperialists' crimes of aggression in Korea and Taiwan have aroused the boundless indignation of the Chinese youth. In order to defend the motherland, help Korea resist aggression, and maintain peace in Asia and the world, the Chinese youth, together with the Chinese people, organized the Chinese People's Volunteers, and fought alongside the heroic Korean People's Army. In the past nine months, more than 200,000 invading troops have been annihilated, including more than 100,000 American troops. This righteous action of the Chinese people and Chinese youth has dealt a serious blow to American imperialism and its accomplices, creating the possibility of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This fact once again shows that peace cannot be begged for, peace must be striven for. More than 343 million Chinese youth and the Chinese people signed in support of the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, and more than 330 million people voted against the United States arming Japan. The Chinese youth are willing to contribute their actual struggle to defend peace as a gift to the 3rd World Youth and Student Peace Festival. The victory of the Chinese people has inspired the fighting enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of oppressed people in Asia. Now, the imperialist warmongers have not only been driven out of mainland China and are being beaten bloody in Korea, but also in Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines, and even throughout Asia, their heinous rule is being resisted by the awakened forces of the people. The facts are increasingly proving that the bloodsucking colonialists in the East are increasingly approaching complete bankruptcy. Any attempt to struggle will inevitably fail.
    Dear friends! We will not allow the imperialists to cause further catastrophe to human culture, will not allow the warmongers to create thousands of orphans, widows, and disabled people, will not allow them to turn countless hospitals, schools, factories, and gardens into deserts and ruins. Let us unite more closely, and fight more bravely! Let the enemies of peace, the warmongers, tremble before us! All youths with good wishes for peace, unite under the banner of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and advance towards lasting peace, people's democracy, and a better future for the youth! The Chinese youth guarantee to all peace-loving and democratic youth in the world that the Chinese youth will always be your loyal friends, and the Chinese youth will always contribute everything they have to the cause of lasting world peace and people's democracy.
    Congratulations on the victory of the 3rd World Youth and Student Peace Festival!
    Long live the great unity of peace-loving youth of the world!
    Long live the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students!
    Long live world lasting peace!
    Long live President Pieck, leader of the German people!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live Marshal Stalin, the standard-bearer of world peace and the mentor of world youth!
          (Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th)

　　在第三届世界青年与学生
    和平联欢节开幕典礼上的演说
    中国青年代表团团长  冯文彬
    亲爱的朋友们：我们中华人民共和国青年代表团和全中国青年，以无限的兴奋来迎接第三届世界青年学生的和平联欢节。我们热爱和平的中国青年很高兴能够又一次地与全世界的青年和平战士一道，向全世界表达我们坚强的爱好和平的愿望，向所有的帝国主义者战争贩子们表示坚决的意志：“我们要求和平！”
    在这里，我代表中国青年向全世界青年的榜样—光荣的苏联青年致兄弟的敬礼！向各人民民主国家的青年们，向英勇的为反对美帝国主义侵略保卫祖国而战的朝鲜青年朋友们致兄弟的敬礼！向正在为祖国的自由独立而战的殖民地半殖民地的青年朋友们以及资本主义国家的青年和平战士们致兄弟的敬礼！我们特别要向德国的青年朋友们表示衷心的谢意，感谢你们对中国代表团热烈的欢迎与招待，并祝贺热爱和平的德国人民与青年在皮克总统的领导之下，在争取和平争取民主统一反对美帝国主义武装西德的斗争中获得更大的胜利。
    目前以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，正准备着新的世界战争。在东方，一年来美帝国主义及其帮凶对和平的朝鲜人民进行着极其野蛮的侵略，并且正在加紧武装日本，肆无忌惮地进行单独对日媾和。在西方，他们正加紧武装西德，他们恶毒地进行反苏反共反和平的宣传。帝国主义者所制造的战争危机正威胁着全人类，保卫和平是当前全世界人民和青年严重的和迫切的战斗任务。今天我们全世界九十多个国家的不同语言、不同肤色、不同政治宗教信仰、不同阶层和不同职业的青年，在伟大的和平旗帜下冲破了并粉碎了战争贩子们千方百计的阻挠，在欧洲和平斗争的前哨——德意志民主共和国的首都柏林召开了第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节。毫无疑义的，这是我们拥护和平力量的一次伟大的检阅，这是和平的胜利。这一事实说明全世界青年都有着爱好和平的热烈的愿望，都有着为和平而战的坚强的意志和决心。
    在伟大的毛泽东主席教导下的中国青年，是热爱和平的并且也懂得如何去争取和平及保卫和平。美帝国主义在朝鲜和台湾的侵略罪行，激起了中国青年的无比义愤。为了维护祖国、帮助朝鲜抵抗侵略，维护亚洲和世界的和平，中国青年和中国人民一道组织了中国人民志愿军，与英勇的朝鲜人民军并肩作战。九个多月来，侵略军已被歼灭了二十余万人，其中美军达十余万人。中国人民和中国青年的这一正义行动给了美帝国主义及其帮凶们以严重的打击，造成了朝鲜问题和平解决的可能性。这一事实再一次说明：和平不能哀求，和平必须争取。三亿四千三百余万的中国青年与中国人民签名拥护缔结五大国和平公约，三亿三千万余人投票反对美国武装日本。中国青年愿以保卫和平的实际斗争，作为对第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的献礼。中国人民的胜利，鼓舞了亚洲亿万被压迫人民的斗争积极性。现在帝国主义战争贩子们不仅已经被赶出中国大陆，在朝鲜被打得头破血流，而且在越南、在马来亚、在菲律宾、乃至在全亚洲，他们的罪恶统治也都受到伟大的觉醒了的人民力量的抗击。事实日益显著地证明吸血的殖民主义者在东方已日益接近彻底的破产了。任何挣扎的企图都必然要失败的。
    亲爱的朋友们！我们不允许帝国主义者再使人类的文化遭受浩劫，不允许战争贩子们来造成千万孤儿寡妇与残废，不允许他们把无数的医院、学校、工厂、花园变成沙漠废墟。让我们更紧密地团结起来吧，更英勇地斗争吧！让和平的敌人战争贩子们在我们面前发抖吧！一切怀有爱好和平的善良愿望的青年联合起来，在世界民主青年联盟的旗帜下、向持久和平、人民民主与青年们更美好的将来前进！中国青年向全世界一切爱好和平民主的青年保证，中国青年永远是你们忠实的朋友，中国青年永远将为世界持久和平与人民民主的事业而贡献出自己的一切。
    祝贺第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节胜利！
    全世界爱好和平的青年大团结万岁！
    世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会万岁！
    世界持久和平万岁！
    德国人民领袖皮克总统万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    世界和平的旗手、世界青年的导师伟大的斯大林大元帅万岁！
