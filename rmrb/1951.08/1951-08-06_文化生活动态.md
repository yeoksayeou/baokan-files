　　“Beijing Wenyi” Volume 2, Issue 5: Holds a Symposium on "Popularization Problems"
"Beijing Wenyi" Volume 2, Issue 5 published a "Symposium on Popularization Problems." Participants in this symposium included Lao She, Feng Zhi, Guo Liangfu, Yang Zhensheng, and Wang Pengshou. This symposium conducted a relatively in-depth discussion of the issue of popularization. Guo Liangfu said: "We must be determined to write for the masses of the people, we should understand the people's language, thoughts, and emotions, use the people's language, reflect the people's thoughts and emotions, and write things that are easy for the masses to understand and love to read." Yang Zhensheng said: "Popularization is not just about adopting the people's living language. It is even more about refining, enriching, and developing it on the basis of the people's living language. We must go from being students of the people to being teachers of the people. However, we cannot leave this foundation. If we do, not only will the people not accept it, but the language will not grow, because it has no roots." Lao She said: "I think the problem of popularization is mainly a matter of the author's attitude. If he understands the principle that literature and art must serve the people, he will abandon the old style, old rhetoric, and Europeanized syntax, etc., and learn from the masses' life and language to write for the people. Conversely, if he does not understand the great principle of serving the people, he will be unwilling to give up his original set from the bottom of his heart, and it is no wonder that he cannot write popular things." Feng Zhi said that popularization must pay attention to the purity and health of the language, so that the written works can be loved by the majority of readers. "Water Margin" is a clear proof of this. Wang Pengshou raised the issue of literary and artistic popularization: not only should it be popular in form, but also in content and language, so that everyone can easily accept it, so that they can improve their political level, better accept Chairman Mao's thoughts, and better "serve the people." He also pointed out that in the direction of popularization, we must prevent the use of local dialects, the abuse of terminology, and vulgar style. This symposium is very beneficial and should attract the attention of the literary and art circles to strive to improve literary and artistic creation.
            School Education for Ethnic Minorities in the Northeast Region
School education for ethnic minorities in the Northeast region has greatly developed. For example, the Korean ethnic group currently has 1,287 primary schools with 200,861 students, more than double the number in 1945. There are currently 53 middle schools with 24,371 students, an increase of more than 19,000 from 1945. In 1949, a new ethnic university (Yanbian University) was also established with 483 students. The Mongolian ethnic group has a total of 234 primary schools with 34,556 students, and another three junior high schools and one normal school with a total of 915 students. The Hui ethnic group has a total of 11 primary schools with 6,702 students (and many Hui students enter Han universities); middle school students all study in general schools. According to statistics from Changtu and Changbei counties, the enrollment rate of Hui students is above 90%. The Oroqen ethnic group only has language and no writing. Before 1945, no one went to school. Now, 36 Oroqen children are enrolled in school (the First Complete Primary School in Heihe County).
            Development of Spare-time Education in Inner Mongolia
Spare-time education for workers and peasants (including herdsmen) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has greatly developed in the past six months. In terms of worker education, according to statistics, there are 26,736 workers in the region, and 9,006 people participated in spare-time cultural studies in 1950. In terms of spare-time education for farmers (herdsmen), according to complete materials from Chahar League, Zhaowuda League, and Hinggan League, and incomplete statistics from Jerim League, Hulunbuir League, and Xilingol League, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had a total of 8,595 winter schools in 1950, with 15,134 classes, and a total of 310,862 participants, including 132,774 female students and 21,454 cadres. According to existing statistics, 3,291 winter schools in the region have been converted into permanent people's schools, with a total of 39,781 students. Such development is unprecedented in the history of Inner Mongolia.

            “北京文艺”二卷五期  举办“通俗化问题”笔谈
    “北京文艺”第二卷第五期发表了“通俗化问题笔谈”。参加这次笔谈的，有老舍、冯至、郭良夫、杨振声、王彭寿。这次笔谈，对通俗化问题作了比较深刻的讨论。郭良夫说：“我们要下定决心写给人民群众看，应当了解人民的语言、思想和情绪，运用人民的语言，反映人民的思想情绪，写出来的东西，使人民大众容易看得懂，而且爱看。”杨振声说：“通俗化，不只在采人民的活语言。而更要在人民的活语言的基础上，加以提炼、丰富和发展。要从人民的学生作到人民的先生。但是，不能离开这个基础，离开了，不但人民不会接受，语言也不会生长，因为它没有根。”老舍说：“我以为通俗化的问题，主要的是作者的态度问题。假若他了解了文艺须为人民服务的道理，他就会放弃了旧风格，旧修词，及欧化句法等，而去向群众学习生活与语言，给人民写作。反之，他若不了解为人民服务的大道理，他就从心里不愿放弃他原有的那一套，也就难怪写不出通俗的东西来了。”冯至说，通俗化须注意语言的纯洁与健康，这样写出的作品才能为广大读者所爱读。水浒传就是一个明证。王彭寿对文艺通俗化的问题提出：不但形式上要通俗，在内容、言语等方面更要通俗，使大家容易接受，使他们能提高政治水平，更好的接受毛主席的思想，更好的“为人民服务”。他又指出，在走向通俗化的方向中，必须防止用土语、滥用术语和粗俗作风。这个笔谈是十分有益的，应该引起文艺界的重视，努力改进文艺的创作。
            东北区少数民族的学校教育
    东北区各少数民族的学校教育，现已有很大发展。如朝鲜族，目前共有小学一千二百八十七所，学生二十万零八百六十一人，较一九四五年增加一倍以上。中学现有五十三所，学生二万四千三百七十一人，较一九四五年增加一万九千多人。一九四九年还新建立了民族大学（延边大学）一所，有学生四百八十三人。蒙古族共有小学二百三十四所，学生三万四千五百五十六人，另有初中三所，师范学校一所，共有学生九百一十五人。回族共有小学十一所，学生六千七百零二人（还有不少回族学生进入汉族大学）；中学生则全在一般学校读书。据昌图和昌北两县统计，回族学生入学率均在百分之九十以上。鄂伦春族仅有语言无文字，一九四五年前没有人上学，现有三十六个鄂伦春族儿童入学（黑河县第一完全小学）。
            内蒙业余教育发展
    内蒙古自治区工农（包括牧民）业余教育，半年来有很大的发展。在工人教育方面，据统计，该区共有工人二万六千七百三十六人，一九五○年参加业余文化学习的有九千零六人。在农（牧）民业余教育方面，根据察哈尔盟、昭乌达盟、兴安盟的完全材料，和哲里木盟、呼纳盟、锡林郭勒盟的不完全统计，内蒙古自治区在一九五○年共有冬学八千五百九十五处，计一万五千一百三十四个班，参加学习的总人数共三十一万零八百六十二人，其中有女学员十三万二千七百七十四人，干部二万一千四百五十四人。据现有材料统计，全区有三千二百九十一处冬学已转入常年民校，学员共计三万九千七百八十一人。这样的发展情况，在内蒙历史上是空前的。
