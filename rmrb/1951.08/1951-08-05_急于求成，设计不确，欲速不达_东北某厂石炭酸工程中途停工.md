　　Haste Makes Waste, Flawed Design Leads to Failure
    Petrolic Acid Project in a Northeast Factory Halted Mid-Construction
    Due to the eagerness for quick results and insufficient attention to design work on the part of leading cadres, the petrolic acid project of a certain factory under the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government was forced to halt mid-construction due to the lack of intermediate experiments (semi-industrial small-scale factory trials. The data and experience obtained from these trials serve as the basis for the design and execution of larger-scale production). This project was one of the basic construction projects of the Chemical Industry Bureau in 1951, with preparatory work starting in 1950. In February of the same year, the project was decided upon. Initially, both the factory and the Chemical Industry Bureau felt that the petrolic acid production process was complex and that there was a need to set up an intermediate experimental factory. However, because everyone lacked a deep understanding of design work at the time, they only hoped to build the factory quickly and did not insist on setting up an intermediate experimental factory first. The guiding engineer felt that he already had considerable experience with this project and had conducted some research in the laboratory, so he did not advocate for intermediate experiments either. During the design process, the comrades responsible for the design believed that they did not have a strong grasp of the design and that it should be carefully considered, and that intermediate experiments should be carried out. However, this opinion was not valued, and the design work continued.
    In September 1950, after some construction drawings were made, they were submitted by the Bureau to the factory for construction. By March 1951, a considerable amount of money had been spent on the project, including 790 million yuan on civil construction and installation engineering, over 1 billion yuan on ordered equipment, and over 1.6 billion yuan on purchased and stored materials, totaling an investment of 3.539 billion yuan (Renminbi). In February 1951, the entire design was completed. After research by experts, it was found that there were still many shortcomings in the design. Generally speaking, the basis of the design was insufficient, and many data that should have been obtained from practice were not accurate enough. For example, the original design specified a sulfonation temperature of 180 degrees Celsius, but in fact it should not exceed 160 to 165 degrees Celsius. Another example is that the originally planned time for adding benzene sulfonate to the alkali fusion pot (a large pot made of cast iron for melting solid caustic soda) was two hours, but in fact, according to the designed loading amount, it should be six to seven hours. There were also inconsiderate considerations due to the intention to utilize existing equipment. For example, after alkaline warming (the reaction material in the alkaline fusion pot must undergo a considerable amount of time inside the pot, raising the temperature to 330 degrees Celsius, this heating situation is called alkaline warming), it was planned to use steam to press the molten material from the melting pot into the impregnation tank. In practice, during alkali fusion, sodium sulfite will quickly separate and precipitate. If it is a small-scale production, it can barely be possible to use steam to press the molten material from the melting pot into the impregnation tank; but if it is applied to such a large scale, it is too troublesome and it is difficult to press out the molten material. As for carrying out gas-phase sulfonation and liquid-phase sulfonation in the same pot (and several sulfonation pots in the same workshop) and using large tanks with a capacity of two tons to evaporate benzene, these are all prone to causing violent explosions.
    Based on the above situation, the Chemical Industry Bureau and the factory temporarily suspended the project in March 1951, and decided to redo the intermediate experiment, obtain practical experience data, and modify the design before proceeding with construction. This is the correct and necessary course of action.
    The mid-construction halt of the petrolic acid project once again proves that in carrying out industrial basic construction, simply subjectively demanding speed, and starting construction without a rigorously reviewed and correct design, will only result in haste making waste, and instead delay the country's basic construction plan. Moreover, the investment that has already been used will be accumulated for a long time, and after the design is modified, some of the projects and equipment will be scrapped, causing great losses to the country.

### 急于求成，设计不确，欲速不达  东北某厂石炭酸工程中途停工

　　急于求成，设计不确，欲速不达
    东北某厂石炭酸工程中途停工
    东北人民政府工业部化学工业管理局所属某厂的石炭酸工程由于领导干部急于求成，对设计工作不够重视，未作中间实验（半工业性的小型工厂试验。这种试验所得的资料与经验用作更大规模生产的设计及执行操作的根据），以致中途被迫停工。这项工程是化学工业管理局一九五一年的基本建设工程之一，于一九五○年进行准备工作，同年二月决定了此项工程项目。其初，厂方及化学工业管理局均感石炭酸生产过程复杂，似有举办中间实验厂之需要。但由于当时大家对设计工作还缺乏深刻的认识，只是希望赶快把工厂建立起来，而没有提出一定要先设中间实验厂的要求。指导工程师则感到自己对此工程已有相当经验，并在实验室中进行了一些研究，所以也没有主张作中间实验。在设计过程中，负责设计的同志，认为该项设计把握不大，须慎重考虑，并作中间实验。但这个意见未被重视，设计工作仍继续进行。
    一九五○年九月，部分施工图纸作出后，即由管理局提交厂方进行施工。至一九五一年三月，工程上已花了不少费用，计土木建筑及按装工程约七亿九千万元，订制设备十亿余元，购储材料十六亿余元，总计用去投资三十五亿三千九百万元（人民币）。一九五一年二月设计全部完毕，经专家研究后，发现该项设计中还有很多缺点。一般地说，该设计的根据不够，很多应从实际得出的数据不够确实。如原设计中定磺化温度为摄氏一百八十度，实则不应超过一百六十至一百六十五度。又如原定笨磺酸盐加入碱熔锅（用铸铁所制造的大锅，用以熔化固体烧碱）的时间为二小时，实则按照设计装入量，应为六至七小时。还有因拟利用现有设备而考虑得不周到。如在碱暖（碱熔锅内反应物质在锅内须经相当时间，提高温度至摄氏三百三十度，此加热情况称碱暖。）后，拟用蒸汽将熔融物由熔化锅压入浸渍槽。实际上碱熔时，亚硫酸纳会迅速分离沉下，如系小规模生产，还勉强可以用蒸汽将熔融物由熔化锅压入浸渍槽；但若应用于这样大规模则太麻烦，又很难压出来熔融物。至于把气相磺化与液相磺化放在同一锅内（和几个磺化锅放在同一车间内）进行以及用二吨容量之大罐来蒸发苯的设计等，都容易引起剧烈爆炸。
    基于上述情形，化学工业管理局和厂方即将工程于一九五一年三月暂行停工，并决定重作中间实验，取得实际经验数据，修改设计后再行施工。这样做是正确的、必要的。
    石炭酸工程的中途停工，再一次证明，进行工业的基本建设，只是主观上要求快，没有经过严格审查的正确的设计即开始施工，结果只能是欲速不达，反而延误国家的基本建设计划。而且，已用的投资长期积压，修改设计后部分工程及设备将要作废，造成国家极大的损失。
