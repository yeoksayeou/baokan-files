　　The Movement to Inspect and Revise Patriotic Pacts in Major Factories in the Capital

    Since mid-July, twenty major state-owned factories and enterprises in Beijing have launched a movement to inspect and revise patriotic pacts. This movement has the following characteristics:
    At the beginning of the movement, the Chinese Communist Party organizations in each factory held meetings to study the documents related to patriotic pacts and focused on inspecting the ideology of the cadres. For example, at an enlarged cadre meeting held by the Party Committee of the Clothing Factory on July 17, it criticized the past incorrect understanding of the patriotic pact movement. Some cadres believed that "the patriotic pact movement cannot be combined with the central work and is not as good as directly engaging in production competitions." Therefore, they treated the patriotic pact work, the increased production and donation work, and the production tasks as three central tasks and failed to combine these tasks and unify them under the form of the patriotic pact, resulting in the feeling of "too many centers, too busy." The responsible comrade of the Party Committee also reviewed his past failure to lead this work well. Therefore, the Party Committee resolved to first solve the ideological problems of the cadres and inspect the cadres' understanding of patriotic pacts at the Party branch committee. The General Branch Committee of the Qinghe Woolen Mill also reviewed its past lack of attention to the leadership of this political movement and its failure to organize inspections seriously. Therefore, although 77 groups in the factory had signed patriotic pacts, most of them were not effectively implemented.
    Secondly, the work of inspecting and revising patriotic pacts in each factory is generally carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. By the end of July, fifteen units had formulated specific plans for mobilizing workers to sign, inspect, and revise patriotic pacts. Many units have also established special institutions to inspect patriotic pacts. For example, the People's Printing Factory established a Patriotic Pact Inspection Committee, the Clothing Factory established a Patriotic Pact Competition Committee, and the Mentougou Mining Area organized four inspection teams to work in various mining sites. In the inspection, general units have mastered the leadership method of cultivating typical examples to promote the general. For example, the Postal Bureau organized some Party and trade union cadres to select a bureau and a section as key inspection points to create experience. The Electric Tram Company Repair Factory selected two classes (electrician, lathe operator) as the focus, and the Party and trade union cadres specifically helped them to first inspect the patriotic pacts and summarize their experience to guide the factory's inspection work. The Party committee secretaries of each factory personally took charge and led a group in this movement to inspect and revise patriotic pacts.
    Thirdly, before inspecting the patriotic pacts, each factory generally strengthened the propaganda and education work. Although the patriotic pacts of the workers in each factory were signed on the basis of patriotic education for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the specific ideological education on signing patriotic pacts was generally not carried out in depth at the time of signing. Therefore, there are still some ideas among the workers that do not value patriotic pacts. For example, some workers said: "Whether you sign it or not, it's still the same competition." This time, each factory mobilized Party reporters and propagandists to carry out propaganda on patriotic pacts to the masses. The Automobile Company, the Waterworks Company, the Liulihe Cement Plant, and other units held mass meetings of the whole factory from July 18 to 20 and made mobilization reports. Various propaganda institutions in factories and enterprises have also launched propaganda activities using various propaganda tools, focusing on patriotic pacts and increased production and donations.
    Finally, and most importantly, this inspection and revision of patriotic pacts was not just a matter for a few leading cadres, but mobilized all employees to carry out mass inspections in groups, and then the masses revised them themselves. Therefore, the inspection and revision of patriotic pacts became a mass self-education movement. Some employees also launched criticism and self-criticism in the inspection by linking their own thoughts and the implementation of patriotic pacts in the past. In this way, the workers and masses' awareness of implementing patriotic pacts was improved.
    At present, some units have begun to summarize the work of inspecting and revising patriotic pacts, while others are carrying it out in depth. The Shijingshan Power Plant has also launched a patriotic pact competition movement in the workshops. The leadership of each factory and enterprise generally attaches importance to this work. However, there are still individual units and some cadres who have not given due attention to patriotic pacts. Some units have not yet made specific plans, and the propaganda work is not sufficient.
    In the future, the leading comrades of each factory should seize the opportunity to cultivate typical examples, establish examples of inspecting, revising, and implementing patriotic pacts, and lay the foundation for launching a patriotic pact competition movement.

### 首都各大工厂检查修订爱国公约的运动

　　首都各大工厂检查修订爱国公约的运动
    中共北京市委组织部工厂支部工作科  陆禹
    北京市二十个较大的公营工厂、企业，自七月中旬起，展开了检查与修订爱国公约的运动。这次运动，有如下几个特点：
    运动开始时，各厂中国共产党的组织，都召开了会议，研究了有关爱国公约的文件，并着重检查了干部的思想。如被服厂党委在七月十七日召开的扩大干部会议上，即批判了过去对爱国公约运动不正确的认识，如有些干部认为“爱国公约运动与中心工作不能结合，不如直接搞生产竞赛”，因而把爱国公约工作、增产捐献工作和生产任务，当成三个中心工作，而未能把这些工作结合起来，统一在爱国公约的形式下，结果是感到“中心多，忙不过来”。党委会负责同志也检讨了自己过去未能很好地领导这一工作。因此党委会决议，首先解决干部的思想问题，并在党的支部委员会上检查干部对爱国公约的认识。清河制呢厂党的总支委员会也检讨了过去不重视这一政治运动的领导，未认真地组织检查，因此，该厂虽然有七十七个小组订立了爱国公约，但大部分没有切实执行。
    其次，各厂检查、修订爱国公约的工作，一般都是有计划、有步骤地进行的。到七月下旬，已有十五个单位制订了关于发动职工订立、检查与修订爱国公约的具体计划。不少单位并成立了专门检查爱国公约的机构，如人民印刷厂成立了爱国公约检查委员会，被服厂成立了爱国公约竞赛委员会，门头沟矿区组织了四个检查组，深入各矿场工作。检查中一般单位都掌握了培养典型推动一般的领导方法。如邮政局组织一部分党与工会的干部，选择一个局、一个股作重点检查，以创造经验。电车公司修造厂选择了两个班（电工、旋工）为重点，由党和工会的干部具体帮助他们首先检查爱国公约，并总结他们的经验，以指导全厂的检查工作。各厂党委书记，在此次检查、修订爱国公约的运动中，都亲自下手，领导一个小组。
    再次，各厂在检查爱国公约前，一般都加强了宣传教育工作。各厂职工的爱国公约，虽然是在进行了抗美援朝爱国主义教育的基础上订立的，但订立时一般都未深入进行关于订立爱国公约的具体的思想教育，因而在职工中还存在着一些不重视爱国公约的思想。如有的工人说：“订不订，还不是一样搞竞赛。”这次，各厂都动员了党的报告员和宣传员，向群众进行了有关爱国公约的宣传。汽车公司、自来水公司、琉璃河水泥厂等单位，都在七月十八日至二十日召开了全厂的群众大会，作了动员报告。工厂、企业中的各种宣传机构，也都以爱国公约、增产捐献为中心内容，利用各种宣传工具展开了宣传活动。
    最后，也是最重要的，这次检查与修订爱国公约的工作，不只是几个领导干部在那里忙，而是发动全体职工，以小组为单位，进行了群众性的检查，然后由群众自己来修订，因此，使检查、修订爱国公约形成了群众的自我教育运动。有的职工在检查中并联系自己的思想和过去执行爱国公约的情况，展开了批评与自我批评，这样就提高了职工群众自己执行爱国公约的自觉性。
    目前有些单位的检查、修订爱国公约工作已开始总结，有的正在深入进行，石景山发电厂并开展了车间爱国公约竞赛运动。各工厂企业的领导方面对这一工作一般是重视的。但还有个别单位及部分干部，对爱国公约仍未给予应有的重视，有的单位至今还没有作出具体计划，宣传工作也作得不充分。
    今后，各工厂的领导同志应该抓紧培养典型，树立检查、修订与执行爱国公约的榜样，为开展爱国公约竞赛运动打下基础。
