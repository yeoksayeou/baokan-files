    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th] Pyongyang held a grand gathering on the evening of the 14th to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the "August 15th" Korean Liberation. The leader of the Korean people, General Kim Il-sung, personally attended. Also present at the meeting were Kim Du-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, Heo Heon, Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, Kim Dal-hyun, Vice Chairman, Heo Ga-i, Lee Seung-yeop, Park Jeong-ae, Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, Park Heon-young, Hong Myeong-hui, Deputy Premiers of the Cabinet, heads of democratic parties and social organizations, and representatives from all walks of life, totaling more than 800 people.
    Diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and other countries stationed in Korea, as well as representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, were also invited to attend the ceremony.
    After the meeting began, Premier Kim Il-sung, amidst a standing ovation and cheers, took the stage to deliver a commemorative report on the sixth anniversary of the Korean Liberation. Premier Kim first expressed the entire nation's gratitude, honor, and blessings to the great standard-bearer of the world's peace-loving people, the liberator of the Korean people, Marshal Stalin, and the Soviet army and the Soviet people. Premier Kim analyzed in detail the war situation in the Korean Liberation War over the past year. He pointed out that with the assistance of the people of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, the heroic Korean and Chinese people's forces, fighting side by side, have achieved brilliant results and dealt heavy blows to the American and British aggressors. He emphasized that the Korean People's Army has grown into an invincible force in the Fatherland Liberation War; the Korean people have become heroic people who are good at overcoming difficulties and will surely achieve victory.
    Speaking of the Korean armistice talks currently being held in Kaesong, Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out that the attitude of the Americans in the Kaesong armistice talks today can only show that they do not want to respond to the expectations of peace-loving people all over the world by peacefully resolving the Korean issue; behind the armistice talks, they have the intention of expanding the war of aggression against Korea. Premier Kim Il-sung emphasized that if the Americans continue to adopt an insincere attitude, then the United States must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom. Premier Kim pointed out: If the American aggressors dare to sabotage the Kaesong armistice negotiations and further expand the war, then they will not only be annihilated on the ground, but will also be struck in the air. At the end of General Kim Il-sung's report, thunderous applause rang out throughout the venue.
    Subsequently, the ambassadors of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries to Korea, as well as representatives of the Korean People's Army, delivered congratulatory speeches successively. Soviet Ambassador Razovayev explained in his congratulatory speech the close friendship between Korea and the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's consistent position against foreign interference in Korea and advocating a peaceful solution to the problem. He pointed out that the Korean people's struggle against American imperialist aggression is a lofty contribution to the cause of peace and the cause of strengthening the camp of peace and democracy. While welcoming the Korean people's national holiday, the Soviet people, together with all the comrades-in-arms of the Korean people, congratulate the Korean people on their brilliant achievements on the road to free and democratic development.
    General Ni Zhiliang, Ambassador of our country, on behalf of the Central People's Government, extended warm congratulations and high respect to the hardworking and heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and to the great leader of the Korean people, General Kim Il-sung. He pointed out that the experience of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting side by side has proven that the aggressor, American imperialism, can be completely defeated. The forces of justice throughout the world are on the side of the Korean people. The Korean people will surely win, and American imperialism will surely fail.
    Finally, amid warm applause, the meeting unanimously passed congratulatory telegrams to General Kim Il-sung, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Marshal Stalin. After the meeting, the People's Army Art Troupe performed celebratory programs.
