    Oppose indiscriminate felling and misuse of good timber

    The red pine of Northeast China is one of the most useful and precious tree species, growing only in some parts of eastern Northeast China, with reserves accounting for only 9.08% of all forests in Northeast China. Because it is the most solid and durable timber, user departments compete for this species when requesting timber allocation. Even when other miscellaneous trees can be used, they still want red pine, which becomes a great waste.

    Some places in western Sichuan grow precious trees such as Phoebe zhennan, ginkgo, Ormosia henryi, and camphor, with fine materials, beautiful patterns, and strong resistance to corrosion, making them very useful and rare good timber nationwide. These timbers are needed for certain parts of railway carriages, ships, automobiles, streetcars, and many exquisite handicrafts. However, these trees do not have large natural forests, and the existing number in western Sichuan is not large; newly planted small trees take fifty years to grow to a foot in diameter. However, many of these existing precious trees are being indiscriminately felled and used as ordinary timber for building warehouses, barracks, and other general buildings, and some are even cut down for firewood.

    In all parts of the country where there are precious trees, cadres at all levels must consider the long-term economic construction of the country, correct local viewpoints and thoughts that only care about immediate interests, earnestly protect these trees, and enable these good materials to be used most rationally; at the same time, these trees must be cultivated in a planned way, and efforts should not be spared in cultivating them just because they are difficult to grow into timber in a short period of time.
  The second phase of the land reform movement in the Southwest Region is combined with agricultural production

    The second phase of the land reform movement in the Southwest Region, which began in mid-June, has now entered the stage of confiscation, requisition, and land investigation and evaluation in most areas. Some areas in northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, southern Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces and regions started land reform earlier and are now distributing land, some have already completed the distribution. Areas that started later are also classifying classes. It is expected that the areas implementing land reform in this phase can be completed by the rice harvest in early September as originally planned. From the beginning, all localities paid attention to mobilizing the masses, especially hired and poor peasants; they paid attention to consolidating the organization of peasant associations and propaganda policies. All counties have universally convened peasant representative meetings at the county, district, and township levels, and all townships have held representative meetings of hired and poor peasants to discuss land reform policies, so that peasants can distinguish between the enemy and ourselves; thereby consolidating the ranks of the peasants and launching the land reform movement quickly, in an organized and led manner. In the course of the movement, all localities resolutely punished unlawful landlords engaged in sabotage activities such as spreading rumors, bribing, poisoning, and assassinating in accordance with the law, thereby smashing the resistance of the landlord class and enabling the land reform work to proceed smoothly.

    At present, it is an important season for agricultural production, and land reform work in various parts of the Southwest is being carried out in conjunction with agricultural production. Land reform work teams and work groups scattered in rural areas are equipped with production cadres who are specifically responsible for leading farmers in production. Many district and township cadres take time to go to the fields to help farmers with their work. In order not to delay farmers' cultivation, fewer large-scale meetings were held in this land reform work in various localities. However, some areas implementing land reform have also experienced insufficient attention to production; this phenomenon has now been largely corrected.
  Pay attention to solving ideological problems of workers when popularizing advanced working methods

    Since the advanced working method of Hao Jianxiu, a worker at the State-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, was put forward, the Qingdao Textile Management Branch and the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union established the "Hao Jianxiu Working Method Promotion Group" and went to the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory to promote it. However, in the process of promotion, the promotion group encountered the following three ideological situations among the workers: one was that they felt that Hao Jianxiu's working method was similar to their own; one was that they thought that Hao Jianxiu's working method was still "three diligence and three quickness" (diligence of eyes, hands, and feet, and quickness), and still required strengthening labor intensity; and the other was that they thought that Hao Jianxiu's working method was nothing great, simply thinking that as long as the machine was good, the cotton was good, and the work was easy, less roller lint would be produced.

    In response to these ideological situations, the promotion group adopted methods such as symposiums and individual talks to explain to the workers the advantages of Hao Jianxiu's working method, explaining that Hao Jianxiu's working method mainly involves regular patrols, appropriately allocating various tasks to each patrol, and all work is aimed at reducing yarn breakage and shortening the time for broken ends to flower; explaining that Hao Jianxiu's working method is not just "three diligence and three quickness," but rather making greater work achievements with less labor. At the same time, the promotion group also criticized the erroneous idea that less roller lint depends only on the quality of the machine and cotton and neglecting to improve their own operating methods. After solving these ideological problems, the promotion group also invited Hao Jianxiu to give a practical performance, and the staff of the work group were responsible for specifically guiding the workers to learn, so that the promotion work finally unfolded smoothly. The process of this matter fully illustrates the importance of solving the ideological problems of the workers when promoting advanced production methods.
  Strengthen the unity of workers and staff

    After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement, Chongqing No. 101 Steel Plant held unity meetings in various workshops, using criticism and self-criticism to initially eliminate the barriers between staff and workers. However, some workers still have the idea of underestimating technical personnel, thinking that as long as the workers work harder and produce more, it does not matter much whether they unite with the technical personnel or not. And some staff members also just started to change their old style and do not know how to approach the workers. In order to change this situation, the trade union and administration of the plant, on the one hand, repeatedly explained through various meetings that the cause of accidents in various workshops was mostly the lack of unity and mutual assistance in improving operating techniques between staff and workers. At the same time, technical training classes were held in various workshops to foster closer relations between staff and workers. Since the establishment of technical training classes in June, the workers in various workshops of the plant have been able to learn with an open mind, and the staff have also been able to teach patiently. Therefore, the relationship between staff and workers has improved, and examples of staff and workers jointly studying and improving technology have begun to emerge. Due to the improved relationship between staff and workers and joint research on technology, the production situation in the factory has greatly improved. For example, after learning in the technical training class, the workers in the brickyard improved their operating methods, which increased the output of slag bricks and standard fire bricks by one-third, and the defect rate dropped from 7% to 1.5%. In the past, when accidents occurred, employees complained and blamed each other, resulting in deeper barriers. Now, when an accident occurs, everyone studies it in the technical training class as a learning content and finds out ways to improve it. From this, it can be seen that strengthening the unity of staff and workers is an important part of democratic reform.

    反对滥伐与滥用优良木材
    东北的红松是最有用最珍贵的树种之一，只在东北东部部分地区生长，蓄积量只占东北全部森林的百分之九点零八。因为是最坚固耐用的木料，用料部门请求拨给木材时争要这一树种。满可以用其他杂木的也要红松，这就成为很大的浪费。
    四川西部有些地方生长楠木、白果树、红豆树、香樟等珍贵树木，材料细致，花纹美丽，抗腐抗蚀的能力都很强，用处很大，也是全国稀有的好木材。火车车厢、轮船、汽车、电车上的某些部分和很多精巧的工艺品等，都需用这些木材。这些树木却没有大量的天然林，四川西部现存的数量也已不多；新栽小树，要五十年才能长到一尺直径粗。可是这些现存的珍贵树木却有不少被滥加砍伐，代替一般木材用于修建仓库、营房等一般的建筑物，甚至有的被砍了当木柴。
    全国各地有珍贵林木的地方，各级干部要从国家的长期经济建设上着想，纠正局部观点和只顾眼前利益的思想，认真保护这些树木，使这些良材能够最合理地使用；同时，要有计划地培育这些树木，不能因为短时期内难以成材就不肯用力培植。
  西南区第二期土地改革运动与农业生产结合进行
    六月中旬开始的西南区的第二期土地改革运动，现在多数已进入了没收、征收和查田评产的工作阶段。川北、川东、川南、贵州等省、区部分地区土地改革工作开始较早，现在正在进行分配土地，有的已经分完。开始较迟的地区，也在划分阶级。这一期实行土地改革的地区，预计可按原订计划，在九月初收割稻谷时全部完成。各地工作一开始就很注意发动群众，特别是发动雇农、贫农；注意整顿农民协会的组织和宣传政策。各县都曾普遍召开县、区、乡的农民代表会，各乡都开过雇农贫农代表会，讨论土地改革政策，使农民划清敌我界线；从而并整顿了农民的队伍，迅速地、有组织有领导地展开了土地改革的运动。在运动过程中，各地坚决依法惩办了从事造谣、收买、放毒、暗杀等破坏活动的不法地主，从而粉碎了地主阶级的抵抗，使土地改革工作得以顺利进行。
    目前是农业生产的重要季节，西南各地土地改革工作都是和农业生产结合进行的。散布在农村中的土地改革工作队和工作小组，都设有生产干部，专门负责领导农民生产。许多区、乡干部都抽时间下田帮助农民做活。为了不误农民耕作，各地在这次土地改革工作中开大会较少。但也有部分实行土地改革的地区，存在过对生产重视不够的现象；这个现象现在多已被纠正了。
  推广先进工作方法时要注意解决工人思想问题
    自从国营青岛第六棉纺织厂工人郝建秀的先进工作法被提出来后，青岛纺织管理分局和中国纺织工会青岛市委员会即成立“郝建秀工作法推广组”，首先到第一棉纺织厂去推广。但在推广过程中，推广组遇到了工人群众以下三种思想情况：一种是觉得郝建秀的工作法和自己的工作法差不多；一种是认为郝建秀的工作法仍旧是“三勤三快”（眼、手、脚三勤三快），仍旧要加强劳动强度；再一种是认为郝建秀工作法没什么了不起，单纯地以为只要机器好、棉花好、活好做，就可以少出皮辊花。
    针对这些思想情况，推广组就采取座谈会和个别谈话等方式，向工人群众深入解释郝建秀工作法的优点，说明郝建秀工作法主要是巡回有规律，把各种工作适当地分配在每一次巡回中，一切工作都为着减少断头和缩短断头开花时间；说明郝建秀工作法并不只是“三勤三快”，而是化较少的劳动力而做出较大的工作成绩。同时，推广组也批判了那种以为少出皮辊花只决定于机器和棉花好坏而轻视自己改进操作方法的错误思想。在解决了这些思想问题后，推广组又邀请郝建秀作实际表演，工作组的人员分工负责具体指导工人们学习，这样终于使推广工作顺利展开。这件事情的过程，充分说明了在推广先进生产方法时解决工人群众思想问题的重要。
  加强工人和职员的团结
    重庆一零一钢铁厂在镇压反革命运动以后，各车间曾开过团结大会，用批评与自我批评的方法，初步消除了职员和工人之间的隔阂。但有部分工人存有轻视技术人员的思想，认为只要工人加劲生产，团结不团结技术人员没有多大关系。而部分职员也因旧作风才开始改，不知道怎样和工人接近。该厂工会和行政为了改变这种情况，一方面通过各种会议，反复说明各车间发生事故的原因，多半是职员和工人间的不团结和不能彼此互助改进操作技术，同时，就在各车间举办技术学习班，以密切职员和工人的关系。自六月份技术学习班开始成立以来，该厂各车间工人都能虚心学习，职员也能耐心讲授。因此职员和工人的关系已有改善，职员、工人共同研究改进技术的事例已开始出现。由于职员和工人的关系改善和共同钻研技术，厂内生产情况已大有改进。如火砖场工人在技术学习班学习后，改进了操作方法，使炉渣砖和标准火砖产量都增加了三分之一，废品率由百分之七降到百分之一点五。过去出了事故，职工间互相抱怨责备，结果造成更深的隔阂。现在一发生事故，大家就在技术学习班上研究，作为学习内容，找出改善的办法。由此可见加强职员与工人的团结是民主改革中不可少的一个重要内容。
