(2) Premier Zhou's congratulatory telegram to General Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea:

	On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the liberation of Korea, please accept my warm congratulations to Your Excellency, your government, and the people, and I wish the heroic Korean people, under your wise leadership, further achievements in the great struggle for the independence and freedom of their motherland and for the defense of world peace.

[Our Newspaper] The China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, and the Jiusan Society have respectively sent telegrams or letters to Premier Kim Il-sung of Korea, congratulating him on the sixth anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

	Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, and Shen Junru, Vice Chairman, stated in their telegram: "Thanks to your correct leadership and the arduous struggle of the Korean people, your country was finally liberated from the iron heel of Japanese imperialism. The American imperialists and their accomplices again attempted to follow in Japan's footsteps, launching a shameless war of aggression in your country on June 25, 1950. For more than a year, thanks to the heroic resistance of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the invaders' conspiracy has finally been shattered. Currently, representatives of your country and representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers are holding armistice talks in Kaesong with representatives of the invaders in order to restore peace in your country. If the invaders still cannot retreat in the face of difficulties, if the invaders lack sincerity for peace, we firmly believe that the Korean people, under your leadership and with the support of the Chinese people and even the people of the world, will surely win the final victory and complete the great cause of peaceful reunification, democracy, and independence of your country."

	The congratulatory telegram from the China National Democratic Construction Association stated: "We are willing to continue to fight to the end for the war of resistance against American imperialism led by you and participated in by the Chinese People's Volunteers!"

	The congratulatory telegram from the China Association for Promoting Democracy stated: "Thanks to the heroic struggle of the entire Korean people and your wise leadership, as well as the brotherly support of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, the friendly solidarity between the Chinese and Korean peoples will surely finally stop the brutal aggression of American imperialism and its accomplices and realize the complete liberation of Korea and lasting peace in Asia."

	The congratulatory telegram from Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, and Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee, stated: "Although the future of the armistice negotiations is fraught with reefs due to the absurd proposals of the US government. However, we firmly believe that the Korean People's Army under your leadership will surely shatter all the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism, complete the great cause of your country's liberation, and strengthen the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp. We wish you more victories!"

	The China Zhi Gong Party stated in a letter to Ambassador Li Zhouyuan to be forwarded to General Kim Il-sung and all the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army: "Today, the American imperialists, although suffering heavy blows from the Chinese and Korean people, and fearing the power of world peace, have been forced to reluctantly hold armistice talks in Kaesong. However, they are also carrying out conspiracies to separately conclude a peace treaty with Japan and arm Japan. They want to revive the heinous Japanese fascist imperialism to harm Korea and China. Therefore, on this sixth anniversary of the liberation of Korea, we must be doubly vigilant and oppose the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism and its accomplices in all aspects."

	The Jiusan Society stated in a letter to Ambassador Li Zhouyuan to be forwarded to Premier Kim Il-sung and all the military and civilians of Korea: "As you celebrate the sixth anniversary of the liberation of Korea in the victorious battle against American aggression, we, in addition to extending warm, fraternal congratulations to the great leader of the Korean people and the heroic Korean people, must further strengthen the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples and continue to support you and completely defeat the American imperialist aggressors."

Xinhua News Agency: Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, sent a telegram to Mrs. Park Jeong-ae, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, congratulating her on the sixth anniversary of the liberation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The telegram is as follows:

	On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the liberation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, all Chinese women extend warm congratulations to our Korean brothers and sisters who are heroically resisting the American aggressors.

	The Korean people and women have achieved great victories in the war of resistance against America to defend national independence and Asian peace, and have gained the support of the people of the world. The Chinese people and women will always unite with our Korean brothers and sisters and fight side by side. In order to crush the aggression of American imperialism and defend peace in Asia and the world, we will work harder, be a hundred times more vigilant, and strive to win greater victories.

    【新华社十四日讯】八月十五日为朝鲜解放六周年纪念日，我中央人民政府毛泽东主席与政务院周恩来总理，于八月十四日分别致电朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会金枓奉委员长及金日成首相表示祝贺。电文如下：
    （一）毛主席贺电朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉阁下：
    欣逢朝鲜解放六周年纪念日，我代表中华人民共和国政府及人民谨向阁下及朝鲜人民致衷心的庆贺，并祝贺中朝两国人民兄弟般的友谊在保卫亚洲及世界持久和平的共同斗争中更加巩固。

                            一九五一年八月十四日于北京
    （二）周总理贺电朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首相金日成将军：
    欣逢朝鲜解放六周年纪念，请接受我对阁下、贵国政府及人民的热烈庆贺，并祝英勇的朝鲜人民在阁下英明的领导下所进行的为争取祖国独立自由、为保卫世界和平的伟大斗争，得到进一步的成就。
                        中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院总理周恩来
                            一九五一年八月十四日于北京
    【本报讯】中国民主同盟、民主建国会、中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党、中国致公党和九三学社分别致电或写信给朝鲜金日成首相，祝贺朝鲜解放六周年纪念日。
    中国民主同盟主席张澜和副主席沈钧儒致电称：“由于您的正确领导和朝鲜人民的艰苦奋斗，贵国终于从日本帝国主义的铁蹄之下获得了解放。美帝国主义者及其帮凶竟又妄图步日本的后尘，于一九五○年六月二十五日在贵国发动无耻的侵略战争。年余以来因朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英勇抗击，终于粉碎了侵略者的阴谋。目前贵国的代表和中国人民志愿军的代表正在开城和侵略者的代表举行停战谈判，以求恢复贵国的和平。假如侵略者尚不能知难而退，假使侵略者缺乏和平诚意，我们深信朝鲜人民在您的领导和中国人民乃至全世界人民的支援之下，一定能够获得最后的胜利，完成贵国和平统一民主独立的大业。”
    民主建国会的贺电中表示：“愿继续为您所领导及中国人民志愿军所参加的抵抗美国帝国主义的战争而奋斗到底！”
    中国民主促进会的贺电中说：“由于全体朝鲜人民的英勇斗争和您的英明领导，也由于苏联和各人民民主国家兄弟般的支援，中朝两国人民的友好团结，必能最后制止美帝国主义及其帮凶们的残暴侵略，实现朝鲜的彻底解放和亚洲的持久和平。”
    中国农工民主党中央执行委员会主席章伯钧、中央监察委员会主席彭泽民的贺电中说：“尽管停战谈判的前途，由于美国政府的荒谬提案而存在着暗礁。但是我们坚信在你领导之下的朝鲜人民军，必能粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋，完成贵国解放的大业，加强世界和平民主阵营的力量。敬祝更多胜利！”
    中国致公党致李周渊大使转金日成将军和朝鲜人民军全体将士的信中说：“今天，美国帝国主义者，虽然在遭受了中朝人民的痛击之后，慑于世界和平的力量，不能不勉强举行开城停战谈判，然而它又在进行单独与日本媾和，和武装日本的阴谋。要使万恶的日本法西斯帝国主义重新复活，来为害朝鲜和中国。所以，在这朝鲜解放六周年纪念的时候，我们必须加倍警惕，从一切方面反对美国帝国主义及其帮凶们的侵略阴谋。”
    九三学社致李周渊大使转金日成首相并转朝鲜全体军民的信中说：“当你们在反美侵略的胜利战斗中庆祝朝鲜解放六周年的今天，我们除了向伟大的朝鲜人民领袖和英勇的朝鲜人民致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺外，并且要进一步加强中朝人民的战斗友谊，再接再厉地支援你们，彻底打败美帝国主义侵略者。”
    【新华社讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅顷致电朝鲜民主女性总同盟委员长朴正爱夫人，祝贺朝鲜民主主义人民共和国解放六周年。电文如下：
    值此朝鲜民主主义人民共和国解放六周年，全中国妇女谨向英勇抗击美国侵略者的朝鲜兄弟姊妹致热烈的祝贺。
    朝鲜人民与妇女在保卫祖国独立，和亚洲和平的抗美战争中，已经获得了伟大的胜利，和全世界人民的支援。中国人民和妇女永远与朝鲜兄弟姊妹团结一致，并肩作战。为了粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，保卫亚洲及世界和平，我们将更加努力，百倍警惕，为赢得更大的胜利而奋斗。
