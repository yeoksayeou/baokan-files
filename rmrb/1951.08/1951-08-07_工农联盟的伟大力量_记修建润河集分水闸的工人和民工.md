　　The Great Strength of the Worker-Peasant Alliance
    ——A Record of the Workers and Laborers Building the Runheji Diversion Sluice Gate
    During the construction of the Runheji Diversion Sluice Gate project in the middle reaches of the Huai River, various skilled workers led laborers in collaborative work and used their advanced skills to teach the laborers. This overcame the difficulty of a shortage of skilled workers in the project and further demonstrated the great strength of the worker-peasant alliance.
    More than 40,000 skilled workers and laborers participated in the diversion sluice gate project, of which about 10,000 were skilled workers. They came from large cities such as Shanghai and Hangzhou, as well as towns in northern Anhui. After the concrete work of the diversion sluice gate began, more than ten different technical tasks were carried out simultaneously, and the number of skilled workers on the construction site was therefore greatly insufficient. At this time, the project leadership immediately decided to select laborers to learn technical work. When the laborers first started working, the workers helped them build work sheds and prepare meals; when it rained and some of the laborers' sheds leaked, the workers gave their beds and mats to the laborers to sleep on and lent them their clothes. The laborers also actively helped the workers carry tools, cook, and serve tea; the laborers competed to do odd jobs during work and clean up tools before and after work, asking the workers to rest more. After the workers and peasants became closely acquainted, the workers further understood the pain of the peasants suffering from floods for years and expressed their determination to help the peasants achieve economic liberation with practical actions.
    With the active help and patient guidance of the workers, a large number of laborers who could only dig and carry soil not long ago quickly learned technical skills. Among the 36 workers laying light railway tracks, 30 were trained laborers. Some of them had never even seen railway tracks before. After the workers taught them using a method of explaining and doing at the same time, the laborers quickly learned skills such as laying roads, maintaining roads, and driving spikes. More than 200 laborers learning to push dump trucks on the tracks overturned the trucks seven or eight times a day when they first started, but later they were able to basically eliminate accidents. In addition, many laborers learned the mixing ratio of yellow sand and gravel, the method of using concrete mixers, and the technology of operating water pumps.
    The magnificent construction aroused the laborers' love for the great motherland and their respect for the working class. When they saw a large number of machines being transported to the construction site and the workers' skilled work techniques, they admired them and said: "Without Chairman Mao's ideas and the skills of the worker brothers, how could the Huai River be tamed by relying solely on us to carry soil and build dikes!" The entire team of laborers from the Mashi Brigade of Huoqiu County also wrote letters to the hardware and cement workers to express their respect and gratitude for building the diversion sluice gate. The laborers who learned to lay light railway tracks said: If railway workers are needed in the future, they will definitely participate. Laborer Mu Daohua said: "The winter school textbook says that the workers are the leading class, and we didn't understand this principle clearly. This time, seeing the power of the worker brothers with our own eyes is truly great. The liberation of the peasants must rely on the working class." You Xiaochun, a laborer from Geng Zhuangzi, Yingshang County, pointed to the oil drums and lifting machinery on the construction site and asked a working cadre: "Were these machines bought from foreign countries?" The working cadre told him that they were manufactured by factories in Shanghai. He excitedly said: "During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, even a small foreign knife was always 'American goods' or 'British goods'. Our new China is really amazing, Chairman Mao really has a way." (Xinhua News Agency)

　　工农联盟的伟大力量
    ——记修建润河集分水闸的工人和民工
    在淮河中游润河集分水闸工程进行期中，各种技术工人领导民工协同工作，并以自己的先进技术教给民工，因而克服了工程中缺少技术工人的困难，更充分显示了工农联盟的伟大力量。
    参加分水闸工程的技术工人和民工共四万多人，其中技术工人约一万人，他们都是来自上海、杭州等大城市及皖北各城镇。分水闸的混凝土工程开始后，十种以上不同的技术工作同时进行，工地上的技术工人因此大大不够分配，这时，工程领导方面立即决定挑选民工学习技术工作。民工初参加工作时，工人们帮他们搭工棚，搞伙食；下雨时，有的民工工棚漏雨，工人们就将自己的床铺和席子让给民工睡，把衣服借给民工穿。民工们亦主动地帮助工人拿工具，烧饭，送茶水等；工作中的零碎活以及收工前后整理工具等工作，民工们都争着做，叫工人多休息。工农密切接近后，工人们更进一步地了解到农民连年遭受水灾的痛苦，纷纷表示要以实际行动帮助农民在经济上翻身。
    在工人的积极帮助和耐心指导下，大批不久以前只会挖土担土的民工都很快地学会了技术。三十六个铺设轻便铁道的工人中，有三十个是训练出来的民工。他们有的过去连铁轨都未见过，经工人们采取边讲边做的办法教授，民工们很快便学会了铺路、养路、打道钉等技术。学习在铁轨上推斗车的二百多个民工，初学时每天要翻七、八次车，后来已能基本上消灭事故。此外，还有很多民工学会了黄砂和石子的配合比例，和使用混凝土拌和机的办法，以及开动抽水机的技术等。
    规模宏伟的建设，激起了民工对伟大祖国的热爱和对工人阶级的尊敬。当他们看到大批机械运到工地上和工人们熟练的工作技术时，一致钦佩地说：“没有毛主席出主意，没有工人老大哥的本领，单靠我们挑土打坝子，淮河咋能治好呢！”霍邱县马石中队的全体民工并写信给五金、洋灰工人致敬，感谢他们建造了分水闸。学铺轻便铁道的民工表示：以后如果需要铁道工人，他一定参加。民工穆道华说：“冬学课本上说工人是领导阶级，咱还弄不清这道理，这次亲眼看到工人老大哥的力量实在伟大，农民翻身必须倚靠工人阶级。”颍上县耿庄子民工游孝春，指着工地上的油筒和启闭机械问一个工作干部：“这些机器是不是向外国买的？”工作干部告诉他这是上海工厂制造的。他兴奋地说：“国民党反动派统治时期，连一把小洋刀也是什么‘美国货’、‘英国货’的，咱们新中国可真了不起，毛主席真有办法。”（新华社）
