Xinhua News Agency, 5th. One of the purposes of the United States' efforts to delay and obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations is to attempt to maintain a tense international situation in order to realize its plot to sign a unilateral peace treaty with Japan in early September and accelerate the rearmament of Japan.

As early as when Malik had just proposed holding Korean armistice negotiations, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries were worried that their plan for a unilateral peace treaty and the rearmament of Japan would be affected. According to a June 25th report by United Press International from Tokyo, "As long as the Korean war continues for one more day, most Pacific countries will agree to a peace treaty with Japan that does not restrict Japan's rearmament. Once the Korean War ceases, their deep-rooted distrust of Japan will cause them to propose amendments to restrict Japan." The Japanese reactionaries also had the same panic. According to a June 26th report by Reuters from Tokyo: "Officials of the Japanese Foreign Ministry" worried that Malik's proposal would make it difficult to sign a unilateral peace treaty with Japan. He said: "Several allies, in view of the critical international situation, have abandoned some of the conditions they originally requested to be stipulated in the treaty, or have adopted a compromise attitude in this regard. The treaty is about to be completed without the consent of the Soviet Union." After Malik's proposal was put forward, "The Japanese believe that: a truce in Korea and the subsequent easing of the tense international situation, at least a temporary easing, may prompt Britain, the Philippines, and some other countries to propose stricter peace treaty conditions."

It is precisely for this reason that after the start of the Korean armistice negotiations, the United States hurriedly prepared to stage the ugly farce of a unilateral peace treaty with Japan. On July 20, the United States hastily announced the so-called "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan," whose wording still needed to be revised, and unilaterally decided to convene the so-called "Peace Conference with Japan" on September 4. According to Marshall's statement to the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on July 18, the Korean armistice negotiations would not be concluded until early September at the earliest. It is not difficult for people to see from here that there is a close relationship between the U.S. delaying the Korean armistice negotiations and accelerating the peace treaty with Japan.

　　美国企图保持紧张国际局势
    以实现其片面对日媾和阴谋
    这是美国竭力阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的丑恶目的之一
    【新华社五日讯】美国竭力拖延与阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的目的之一，是企图保持紧张的国际局势，实现在九月初签订片面对日和约以加速重新武装日本的阴谋。
    早在马立克刚刚提出举行朝鲜停战谈判建议的时候，美、日反动派就担心它们之间片面媾和与重新武装日本的计划，将会遭受影响。据合众社东京六月二十五日电透露，“只要朝鲜战火一天还在继续，大多数太平洋国家就会赞成不限制日本重新武装的对日和约。一旦朝鲜停战，它们对日本根深蒂固的不信任，就会使他们提出束缚日本的修正案。”日本反动派也存在着同样的恐慌。据路透社东京六月二十六日讯：“日本外务省官员”担忧马立克的建议将使片面对日和约的签订发生困难。他说：“好几个盟国鉴于国际局势危急，已放弃它们原先要求在和约中规定的若干条件，或在这方面采取妥协态度。和约就在这样未得到苏联赞同的情况下即将准备完成”。马立克建议提出后，“日本人认为：朝鲜休战以及紧张的国际局势跟着趋于缓和，至少是暂时趋于缓和，也许会促使英国、菲律宾及其他一些国家提出较严格的媾和条件。”
    正是因为这个缘故，在朝鲜停战谈判开始以后，美国就急急忙忙筹备排演片面对日媾和的丑剧。七月二十日，美国就匆忙把字句还须修改的所谓“对日和约草案”公布，同时片面决定在九月四日召开所谓“对日和会”。据马歇尔七月十八日在美国众院军事拨款小组委员会上表示，朝鲜停战谈判最早也要拖到在九月初才有结果。人们从这里不难看出，美方拖延朝鲜停战谈判与加速对日媾和之间有着密切的关系。
