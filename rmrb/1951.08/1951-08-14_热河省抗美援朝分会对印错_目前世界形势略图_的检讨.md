Column: Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions

    To the Editor:
    We have read the short commentary in *Book and Newspaper Review*, No. 19, entitled “Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Publishing Work,” and the article written by comrades Lu Wei and Zhang Xin of the People's Printing Factory, entitled “An Example of Imprudence in Group Publications.” Both articles pointed out the errors and shortcomings in the "Current World Situation Sketch Map" published by our branch. After reading them, we immediately conducted an inspection. This map was originally commissioned to the West Avenue Wenyouzhai Printing Factory in Chengde City for printing. Because it was printed manually, some of the map colored the New Democratic countries incorrectly, forming a political error. We are now trying to recover the incorrectly printed maps. This error shows our negligence. The criticisms from readers and the *People's Daily* are very educational for us. We absolutely guarantee that such serious political errors will not occur again in the future.
                                          Hebei Province Resist America, Aid Korea Branch

### 热河省抗美援朝分会对印错“目前世界形势略图”的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    热河省抗美援朝分会对印错“目前世界形势略图”的检讨编辑同志：
    《书报评论》第十九期《认真作好出版工作》的短评和人民印刷厂卢纬、张信二同志写的《团体出版物不慎重的一例》，两文均指出本会出版《目前世界形势略图》的错误和缺点。我们看了以后，立即进行检查。这份地图原是交给承德市西大街文友斋印刷厂印制的，因系手工印刷，部分地图把新民主主义国家着错了颜色，形成了政治性错误。现我们正在设法把印错的地图收回。这一错误说明了我们的疏忽大意。读者和人民日报的批评对我们的教育很大，今后绝对保证不出这样严重的政治性错误。
                                          热河省抗美援朝分会
