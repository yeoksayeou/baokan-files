Seventeen Warriors Brave the Dadu River

　　In May 1935, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, during the Long March, arrived at the Dadu River in southern Sichuan Province. The counter-revolutionary chieftain Chiang Kai-shek ordered hundreds of thousands of bandit troops to pursue closely, gleefully shouting: "Zhu and Mao are about to become the second Shi Dakai of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom!" But Chiang Kai-shek's dream was shattered. The Red Army soldiers, with their unwavering loyalty to the Party and the people, under the correct leadership of their superiors, carefully planned and bravely fought, finally defeating the enemy and breaking through this natural barrier that was said to be impossible to cross even with wings.

　　The Dadu River is a tributary of the Yangtze River, with steep mountains and towering ridges on both banks, making the terrain extremely dangerous. The river is more than two miles wide, three to four fathoms deep, and the current is as swift as ten thousand horses galloping. The sound of the rushing water can be heard from forty miles away. The Red Army was attacked from both sides by the enemy, making crossing the Dadu River an exceptionally difficult task. However, the river had to be crossed! If the Red Army could not cross the river, it would be impossible to escape the pursuit of the enemy's large army, break through the layers of blockades, and would cause unimaginable difficulties for the realization of the plan to march north and resist Japan. The vanguard of the Red Army (composed of the Red Army's First Regiment, the military corps' directly subordinate engineering company, and the artillery company) passed through the minority ethnic areas and then marched rapidly (160 li in one day and night) to the vicinity of Anshunchang on the south bank of the Dadu River. At that time, three regiments of Sichuan warlords were guarding the Luding Bridge, one regiment was guarding the river mouth on the opposite bank of Anshunchang, and two regiments of the warlord Yang Sen were guarding thirty li downstream, preventing the Red Army from crossing the river. In Anshunchang on the south bank of the Dadu River, two companies of enemy troops were guarding the area, but there was only one ferry boat, which was guarded by a squad of enemy soldiers. That night, because the Red Army had traveled 160 li on mountain and stone roads in a forced march, the troops were very tired, and the sky was dark. It was difficult to aim when firing guns, and even if the enemy approached, it would be difficult to detect them. However, under these very difficult combat conditions, the Red Army comrades still used swift and fierce actions to annihilate the enemy troops guarding Anshunchang in one fell swoop, seizing the only ferry boat and obtaining the prerequisite for forcibly crossing the Dadu River. The next day, the Red Army decided to begin the forced crossing in front of the enemy at 1:00 PM.

　　On the opposite bank of the Dadu River, there was a small village of five or six households about a mile from the shore. In addition, there was a detached house near the riverbank, guarded by an enemy battalion. The responsible comrades of the vanguard estimated that the enemy's main force must be hiding in the small village, intending to launch a counter-attack when the Red Army's daring crossing team had not yet gained a firm foothold after landing, pressing the Red Army back into the water. Therefore, to carry out a forced crossing in front of the enemy, it was necessary to fully prepare firepower to defeat the enemy's counter-attack. Therefore, three mortars and five heavy machine guns were immediately organized and placed in advantageous positions. Light machine guns and a dozen elite rifle sharpshooters were also concealed in the riverbank positions, forming crossfire. In terms of troop deployment, it was decided that the Second Battalion would feign a crossing in the lower reaches, more than ten li away, the First Battalion would carry out the crossing assault, and the Third Battalion would serve as a reserve force. Sixteen young, strong, determined, and brave Red Army soldiers, mostly Communist Party members, were selected from the First Battalion and organized into a daring crossing team, led by Comrade Xiong Shanglin, the Second Company Commander. These seventeen warriors, with a determination to sacrifice themselves, unhesitatingly accepted the task assigned by the Party. The regimental leaders personally summoned them to mobilize them, providing each person with a long and short gun, five to six grenades, and work tools. They were instructed to first seize the enemy's firepower point in the detached house after crossing the river, then capture the village, and after capturing it, immediately dig loopholes for guns and build fortifications, turning the houses into fortresses, resolutely repelling the enemy's counter-attack, and not retreat even if only one person remained, so that subsequent troops could cross the river. To enhance their confidence in victory, they were also told that there would be fire support from across the river.

　　The warriors boarded the boat and set off, the ferry heading straight for the center of the river. The heroic small boat, bumping and swaying, sometimes visible and sometimes not, broke through the rapid currents and giant waves, and finally quickly reached the opposite bank under the cover of the Red Army's firepower. Sure enough, just as the seventeen warriors landed, more than 300 enemies rushed out of the village to launch a counter-attack. The Red Army fought with their backs to the water, and the situation was very critical. However, the Red Army was prepared. As soon as the enemy left the village, the mortars and heavy machine guns on the south bank fired simultaneously. In particular, Comrade Zhao Zhangcheng, a sharpshooter with his mortar, hit the target every time, scattering the enemy everywhere. The heavy machine guns then extended their fire, carrying out firepower pursuit. Comrade Li Decai's heavy machine gun shot the enemy tumbling down the hillside on their backs, killing them so that they fled into the mountains in panic. At this time, the seventeen warriors fearlessly charged at the enemy, quickly seizing the village firepower point and consolidating the beachhead position. Thereupon, Battalion Commander Sun Weiguang of the First Battalion led more than 30 people and five machine guns and submachine guns and immediately crossed the river on the second boat. Following them, Regiment Commander Yang Dezhi also boarded the third boat, bringing several machine guns to continue to expand the victory and consolidate the position. At this time, it was very dark. Relying on this only boat, the Red Army's First Regiment continued to cross the river non-stop throughout the night, until the entire regiment had crossed by the morning of the next day. The exemplary river crossing battle of forcibly crossing the Dadu River was victoriously completed. This battle provided a strong guarantee for the left wing of the Red Army to seize the Luding Bridge, enabling our main force to pass smoothly over the bridge. This battle played a major and crucial role in the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's completion of the historic feat of the 25,000-li Long March. Because of this special achievement, the Central Military Commission rewarded the seventeen warriors who forcibly crossed the river in front of the enemy and the commanders and fighters of the Red Army's First Regiment.

　　The seventeen warriors were: Xiong Shanglin, Second Company Commander; Zeng Huiming, Second Platoon Leader; Liu Changfa, Third Squad Leader; Zhang Kebiao, Deputy Squad Leader; Fighters: Zhang Guicheng, Xiao Hanyao, Wang Huating, Liao Hongshan, Lai Qiufa, Zeng Xianji; Guo Shicang, Fourth Squad Leader; Zhang Chengqiu, Deputy Squad Leader; Fighters: Xiao Guilan, Zhu Xiangyun, Xie Liangming, Ding Liuming, Zhang Wanqing.

　　十七勇士强渡大渡河
    一九三五年五月，长征的中国工农红军到了四川省南部的大渡河边，反革命头子蒋介石命令数十万匪军跟踪紧追，兴高采烈地叫喊：“朱毛就要成为太平天国石达开第二了！”但是蒋介石的这个梦想落空了，对党对人民赤胆忠心的红军健儿们，他们在上级正确的领导下，精心计划英勇作战，终于击溃了敌人，冲破了这道插翅也难飞过的天险。
    大渡河是长江的一道支流，两岸都是二、三十里高的高山峻岭，地势非常险要。河面有二里多宽，水深三四丈，水流急如万马奔腾，从四十里以外就可以听到哗哗的水声。红军前后受到敌人的夹攻，要渡过大渡河确实是一件异常困难的事，但是，河是必须过去的！红军如果不能渡河，那么就无法摆脱敌人大军的追击，冲破层层的堵截，对于实现北上抗日的计划就要发生不可想像的困难了。红军先遣部队（红军一团，军团直属工兵连炮兵连组成）通过了少数民族地区之后，又以强行军（一日一夜共一百六十里）赶到了大渡河南岸的安顺场附近。当时四川军阀的三个团把守着泸定桥，一个团在安顺场的对岸一线把守住河口，下游三十里处另有军阀杨森的两个团扼守，阻止红军渡河。在大渡河南岸的安顺场，就有两个连的敌人守着，渡船却只有一个，可是敌人还派一个班的兵力把船守住。当夜，红军由于经过一百六十里山石路上的急行军，部队非常疲劳，而且天色漆黑，不但打枪看不见准星，就是敌人跑到身边来也难于发觉。但是就在这种非常困难的作战条件下，红军同志们仍然以勇猛强袭的动作，一举歼灭了安顺场的守敌。夺取了那只唯一的渡船，取得了强渡大渡河的先决条件。第二天，红军决定在下午一时开始敌前强渡。
    在大渡河的对岸，离岸有一里多的地方有五六户人家的小村庄，另外靠河岸的方向有一所独立房屋，敌军一个营在那里把守。先遣部队负责同志估计敌人的主力一定在小村庄里面隐蔽着，他们想在红军渡河奋勇队登陆后还没有站稳脚跟的时候，就实行反冲锋，压迫红军下水。因此进行敌前强渡就必须充分准备火力，打垮敌人的反冲锋。于是立刻组织了三门迫击炮，五挺重机枪，按放在有利的阵地上，轻机枪和十几名特等步枪射击手也隐蔽的进入河岸阵地，构成交叉火力。在兵力的使用上，决定二营在下游十余里的地方伪装着要渡河的样子，一营担任渡河突击，以三营作预备队。从第一营里挑选出来的十六名年青力壮、坚决勇猛的红军战士，大都是共产党员，组织成渡河奋勇队，派二连连长熊上林同志为队长，这十七位勇士都抱着牺牲的决心，毫不犹豫地接受了党所交给的任务。团首长亲自召集他们进行动员，每人准备长短枪各一枝，带着五个到六个手榴弹，并且带着工作器具，规定过河后首先夺取独立房屋的敌人火力点，然后攻取村庄，攻占以后立即挖枪眼作工事，把房屋变成堡垒，坚决打退敌人的反冲锋，就是只剩下一个人也不能退出，以便后续部队渡过河去。为了增强他们胜利的信心，并且告诉他们隔河有火力援助。
    勇士们登船出发了，渡船直向河心奔去。英勇的小船，颠颠簸簸，时隐时现，冲破了急流巨浪，在红军的火力掩护下，终于很快地到了对岸。果然，当十七位勇士刚刚登岸的时候，三百多敌人就从村子里突出来，实行反冲锋，红军背水作战，情势是非常危急的。但是，红军早有了准备，当敌人刚一出村，南岸的迫击炮，重机枪一齐发射，尤其是神炮手赵章成同志的那门迫击炮百发百中，打的敌人四处逃散，重机枪随即伸延射击，实行火力追击，李得才同志使的那挺重机枪，打得敌人仰面朝天地滚下山坡，杀得敌人慌忙向山里逃窜。就在这个时候十七勇士奋不顾身地向敌人冲杀，很快地抢占了村庄火力点，巩固了河滩阵地。于是一营孙维光营长带领三十多人和五挺机枪与手提式连忙乘第二只船渡河。跟着，杨德志团长也乘坐着第三只船过去，带去几挺机枪，继续扩大战果，巩固阵地。这时候天色很黑，依靠了这唯一的船只红军第一团仍然不停地夜渡，直到第二天上午全团才全部渡完。强渡大渡河的模范的河川战斗胜利地完成了，这一战斗使得红军的左翼兵团强夺泸定桥得到了有力的保证，使我们的主力能够顺利地从桥上通过。这一战斗，对于中国工农红军完成历史创举的二万五千里长征，是有着重大的关键作用的。由于这一特殊的功绩，中央军委奖励了敌前强渡的十七勇士和红军第一团的指战员们。
    这十七个勇士是：二连连长熊上林，二排排长曾会明，三班班长刘长发，副班长张克表，战斗员：张桂成、萧汉尧、王华亭、廖洪山、赖秋发、曾先吉，第四班班长郭世苍，副班长张成球，战斗员：萧桂兰、朱祥云、谢良明、丁流名、张万清。（据总政新闻处稿，略有修改）
