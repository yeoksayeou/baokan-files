　　On the Instructions of the Government Administration Council:
    Establishment of a Joint Timber Inspection Group
    To Conduct Inspections Centered in Beijing for the Time Being
    [Our Newspaper] Recently, the timber market in our country has been relatively chaotic, and timber prices have risen significantly. This situation is most severe in Beijing and Tianjin. This not only affects the normal supply and rational use of timber but has also caused significant damage to the country's basic construction. The reasons for this situation are mainly that some departments in need of timber illegally sell the timber allocated by the state; some agencies illegally engage in buying and selling timber; and there is also a serious waste of timber in its use. In order to investigate this chaotic situation, correct this chaos, and ensure the state's construction needs for timber, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has instructed the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government to be responsible for this work. On August 1st, the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council specially invited representatives from relevant departments such as the Financial and Economic Committee and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission to hold a meeting and established a joint timber inspection group. This group will specifically inspect illegal incidents and waste phenomena in the use of timber by various units and report them to the Government Administration Council for handling. The joint timber inspection group consists of eleven people, including Liu Jingfan, Deputy Director of the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council, Zhang Muyao, Director of the First Department, Shi Lin, Deputy Director of the Materials Supply Planning Department of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and Yuan Zongqing, Director of the Camp Management Department of the Logistics Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission. Liu Jingfan serves as the leader, and Zhang Muyao, Shi Lin, and Yuan Zongqing serve as deputy leaders. The group has three inspection teams: the Military Commission Team, the Financial and Economic Team, and the Beijing and Other Departments Team. The inspection targets are temporarily centered in Beijing. The joint timber inspection group has now begun its work, starting inspections at Yongmao Company in Beijing, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Public Security Logistics Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Xinghua Lumber Mill, and the Tieji Factory and Shengji Factory of the Central Railway Department. In addition to the joint timber inspection group sending people to conduct in-depth inspections, the inspection method also involves mobilizing staff members of the inspected units to study relevant policies and regulations and conduct in-depth self-criticism. In order to widely collect materials, the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council and the Beijing Municipal People's Supervision Committee have separately notified supervision correspondents to assist in collecting information.

　　奉政务院指示
    成立木材联合检查组
    暂以北京为中心进行检查
    【本报讯】近来我国木材市场的情况比较混乱，木材价格上涨很多，这种情况，以北京、天津为最甚。这不但影响了木材的正常供应和合理使用，而且已经给国家的基本建设造成很大损害。产生这种情况的原因，主要是某些需要木材的部门将国家调拨的木材违法出售；有些机关非法地经营买卖木材的生意；同时在木材的使用上也存在着严重的浪费现象。为了调查这种混乱情形，纠正这种混乱状况，以保证国家建设对木材的需要，中央人民政府政务院已指示中央人民监察委员会负责进行这一工作。政务院人民监察委员会于八月一日特邀请财政经济委员会、人民革命军事委员会等有关部门的代表举行会议，成立了木材联合检查组。以便专门对各单位使用木材的违法事件和浪费现象进行检查，并分别报告政务院处理。木材联合检查组系由政务院人民监察委员会副主任刘景范、第一厅厅长张慕尧、政务院财政经济委员会物资供应计划处副处长石林、人民革命军事委员会后勤营管部处长袁宗清等十一人组成；由刘景范任组长，张慕尧、石林、袁宗清任副组长。组内设三个检查小组，即军委组、财经组和北京市等其他部门组，检查对象暂以北京市为中心。木材联合检查组现已开始工作，在北京市永茂公司、北京市政府公安局、人民革命军事委员会公安后勤部、兴华制材厂、中央铁道部的铁记厂和生记厂开始进行检查。检查方式，除木材联合检查组派人深入检查外，并发动被检查单位工作人员学习有关政策法令，深入检讨。为了广泛地搜集材料，政务院人民监察委员会和北京市人民监察委员会已分别通知监察通讯员协助搜集情况。
