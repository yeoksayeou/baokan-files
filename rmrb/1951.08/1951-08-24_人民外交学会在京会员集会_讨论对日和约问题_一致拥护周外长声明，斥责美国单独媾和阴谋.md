Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs held a meeting of all its members in Beijing on the 23rd to discuss the issue of the Japanese Peace Treaty. Those present included Zhou Gengsheng, Luo Longji, Ji Chaoding, Mei Ru'ao, Fan Hong, Zhou Peiyuan, Chen Jiakang, Meng Xianzhang, Zheng Senyu, Chen Tiqiang, and more than 140 other members of the Institute.

Speakers at the meeting indignantly denounced the absurd U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan and exposed the U.S. attempt to manipulate the San Francisco Conference to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan.

Mei Ru'ao pointed out in his speech that the purpose of the United States in conducting a separate peace treaty with Japan is to oppose the peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and China, and to suppress the Asian people's liberation movement. He said: We must call on the people of the whole country and the people of all of Asia to strengthen the struggle against the U.S. separate peace treaty with Japan. Zheng Senyu analyzed in detail the absurdity and irrationality of the U.S.-made draft treaty. He pointed out that every time the United States revises its draft, its content becomes more absurd and infringes more on the sovereignty and interests of China, the Soviet Union, and Southeast Asian countries. The United States not only wants to push Japan onto the road of war, but also attempts to use so-called "security" and "joint defense" military agreements to push Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines onto the road of war. This poses a great threat to peace in the Far East. Meng Xianzhang said: The United States excludes China, which has been fighting against Japan for the longest time, has contributed the most, and has sacrificed the most, and conducts a separate peace treaty with Japan. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. Zhuang Tao pointed out that the U.S.-made separate peace treaty will bring serious disasters to the people and will also arouse greater resistance from the Japanese people. The United States is stepping up its efforts to turn Japan into a U.S. arsenal, which has made the lives of the Japanese people increasingly difficult. If a separate peace treaty is concluded, the living standards of the Japanese people will be further reduced. This will inevitably lead the Japanese people to rise up and fight for national survival. Luo Longji said: The issue of the Japanese peace treaty is an issue of great importance to China. The United States' activities to conduct a separate peace treaty with Japan pose a great threat to China, and the Chinese people must resolutely oppose it.

Other speakers unanimously stated that they resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference, oppose the U.S. separate peace treaty with Japan, strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and donate aircraft and artillery, consolidate national defense, and smash the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to collude with Japan to re-invade.

　　人民外交学会在京会员集会
    讨论对日和约问题
    一致拥护周外长声明，斥责美国单独媾和阴谋
    【新华社二十三日讯】中国人民外交学会于二十三日举行在京全体会员会议，讨论对日和约问题。到会者有该会会员周鲠生、罗隆基、冀朝鼎、梅汝璈、樊弘、周培源、陈家康、孟宪章、郑森禹、陈体强等一百四十多人。
    会上发言者均愤慨地斥责荒谬绝伦的美英对日和约草案，并揭露美国企图操纵旧金山会议签订单独对日和约的阴谋。
    梅汝璈在发言中指出：美国进行单独对日媾和的目的，是反对以苏联、中国为首的和平民主阵营，镇压亚洲人民解放运动。他说：我们要号召全国人民、全亚洲人民加强反对美国单独对日媾和的斗争。郑森禹详细分析了美制和约草案的荒谬悖理。他指出：美国每一次修改它的草案，其内容就益加荒谬，更多地侵犯中、苏以及东南亚各国的主权和利益。美国不仅要将日本推上战争道路，并且企图利用所谓“安全”“联防”军事协定，把澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾推上战争的道路。这对于远东的和平，有极大的威胁。孟宪章说：美国排除对日作战最久、出力最多、牺牲最大的中国，与日本单独媾和，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。庄涛指出：美制单独和约将给人民带来严重灾难，同时也将激起日本人民的更大的反抗。美国加紧变日本为美国的兵工厂，已使日本人民的生活日益困苦。如果单独媾和，日本人民生活水平将进一步降低。这必将引起日本人民奋起为民族生存而战。罗隆基说：对日和约问题是对中国有重大关系的问题。美国进行单独对日媾和的活动，对中国的威胁极大，中国人民必须坚决反对。
    其他发言者一致表示：坚决拥护周恩来外长关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的声明，反对美国单独对日媾和，加强抗美援朝和捐献飞机大炮运动，巩固国防，粉碎美帝国主义勾结日本重新侵略的阴谋。
