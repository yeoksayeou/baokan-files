     The Significant Impact of Water Conservancy Construction on Xinjiang's Economy
　　"Where there is water, there is land." Water is the lifeline of the people of Xinjiang. Therefore, water conservancy construction is the decisive key to developing agricultural and pastoral production and industrial production in Xinjiang.
　　Because Xinjiang is located on a plateau with a dry climate, the average annual rainfall in the entire region is less than 200 millimeters. In areas south of the Tianshan Mountains, it may not rain at all throughout the year, and crops rely entirely on artificial irrigation for growth. At the same time, because Xinjiang has the Altay Mountains, the Kunlun Mountains, and the Tianshan Mountains, the snow peaks and ice ridges of these mountains are all over 4,000 meters above sea level. In spring and summer, the accumulated snow on the high mountains melts into countless inland rivers, which become the source of water for artificial irrigation.
　　For many years, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have fought against the great desert, opening up more than 1,500 large and small canals, irrigating more than 19 million mu of cultivated land. These canals can generally only irrigate about 10,000 mu of land each. About 400 cubic meters per second of constant water flow from rivers throughout Xinjiang seeps into the great desert, which cannot be utilized. If reservoir projects are built to store winter runoff and summer floods, Xinjiang can reliably supply irrigation water at a rate of 700 cubic meters per second. Because the amount of water lost to seepage in the great desert is relatively large, if we calculate an average irrigation area of 15,000 mu per cubic meter per second, we can increase the cultivated area by 10.05 million mu. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang urgently need more water for irrigation and need to increase the amount of cultivated land. Increased cultivated land can develop agricultural and pastoral production and provide a large amount of raw materials needed for industry.
　　A particular difficulty in Xinjiang's water conservancy and irrigation projects is that the water often has to pass through a section of the Gobi Desert to reach the cultivated land. The soil in the Gobi Desert is loose, and water seepage is extremely high (seepage from each kilometer of canal is about 3%), and the ground slope is steep, making the canals easily eroded and silted up by the canal water. Therefore, water conservancy construction in Xinjiang requires large investments and a large labor force to build modern irrigation projects. Building modern water conservancy and irrigation projects was never dared to be proposed or resolved under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary bandits.
　　After the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Xinjiang, it strengthened national defense construction on the one hand and launched a vigorous production movement on the other. In addition to newly opening and repairing water conservancy projects that can irrigate 1.27 million mu in the first half of 1950 to solve the amount of water needed for the troops to cultivate land at that time (of which 400,000 mu of water was given to farmers of all ethnic groups for use), the construction of modern water conservancy and irrigation projects began in the second half of 1950.
            
     People's Liberation Army's Water Conservancy and Irrigation Project Plan
　　The main water conservancy and irrigation projects undertaken by the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang are as follows:
　　(1) Dihua Hongyanchi Reservoir and Heping Canal. The Hongyanchi Reservoir stores water from the Urumqi River in summer and winter, with a storage capacity of 50 million cubic meters. The Heping Canal is 48 kilometers long and uses the water stored in the Hongyanchi Reservoir to irrigate 100,000 mu of land in the Qinggeda Lake area between Dihua and Qiande County. The entire project requires about 500,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Dihua is a grain-deficient area, and reclaiming farmland in Dihua can save a large amount of grain transportation costs.
　　(2) Yanqi Liberation First Canal. The canal is 81 kilometers long, requires about 6 million cubic meters of earthwork, and uses water from the Kaidu River to irrigate 800,000 mu of land on the south bank of the Kaidu River. After passing through the irrigated area, the canal water flows into the Peacock River, connecting with a large canal opened by the People's Liberation Army in Korla. This canal is 42 kilometers long, requires about 1 million cubic meters of earthwork, and uses water from the Peacock River to irrigate 200,000 mu of land west of Dadunzi. It can also connect with the Tarim River to form an irrigation system and develop the vast wasteland west of Yuli.
　　(3) Yanqi Liberation Second Canal. The canal introduces water from the Kaidu River to irrigate 1.2 million mu of land between Yanqi and Hejing County on the north bank of the Kaidu River. It is 105 kilometers long and requires about 3 million cubic meters of earthwork.
　　(4) Aksu Victory Canal. Introduces water from the Aksu River to irrigate 800,000 mu of land west of Shajingzi in Aksu County. It is 72 kilometers long and requires about 3.5 million cubic meters of earthwork.
　　(5) Hami Red Star Canal. Hami is one of the most severely grain-deficient areas. The Red Star Canal introduces water from the Shichengzi River and can increase 40,000 mu of land. It is 32.5 kilometers long and requires about 270,000 cubic meters of earthwork. At the same time, a reservoir with a storage capacity of 40 million cubic meters will be built north of Hami City, so that the irrigation area can be increased to 140,000 mu. The Red Star Canal passes through the Gobi Desert, and the bottom of the canal must be completely paved with stones and filled with cement (substitutes are used in general projects because the cement plant has not yet been established) to prevent seepage and erosion, requiring more than 70,000 cubic meters of stone.
　　The total length of the main and trunk canals of the above main canals is 380.5 kilometers (if the length of branch canals and irrigation canals is added, it will be more than doubled), with a total earthwork of about 18 million cubic meters, irrigating more than 4 million mu of land. Among them, except for the Dihua Hongyanchi Reservoir and Heping Canal, which are old canals that have been renovated, the other canals are newly built. The large canal in Korla was completed and put into operation in May of this year, and the other canals have also been started one after another. All earthwork and canal paving projects can be completed in 1952. The cement concrete construction projects for the canal mouths (canal water inlets), river dams (dams built to raise the water level), water intake gates, and diversion gates will all be completed in 1953.
　　In addition to this, the Honghai Reservoir in Bachu County and the Machang Reservoir in Shule County are also under construction. The planned construction includes the 300-kilometer-long Tielimu Canal in Shache and the Tonggusi Canal in Hotan.
　　The impact of building these canals on Xinjiang's economy is enormous. In addition to solving the grain supply in various regions, eliminating huge transportation costs, and providing raw materials needed for industrial development (such as cotton, hemp, and sugar beets), power plants with a capacity of more than 25,000 horsepower can be built in Dihua Hongyanchi and Yanqi Tiemenguan. At the same time, there are dozens of water drops on each main canal, each of which can provide more than 1,700 horsepower of hydropower. This electricity can be used to supply power for industry and for lighting.
　　The People's Liberation Army demonstrated unparalleled perseverance and great heroism in building large-scale water conservancy and irrigation projects. Even in the severe cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius last winter, water conservancy projects never stopped. They needed wood for the construction of the project, so they felled wood in the Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains, where the snow was knee-deep; they needed stones to pave the canals and build water drop projects, so they blasted stones from dozens of kilometers away and carried them by manpower; they needed pickaxes and hoes, so they established small iron factories to manufacture hoes and pickaxes themselves; they needed cement, so they used lime, brick powder, and clay mixed in proportion to replace cement (true cement is still needed for river dams, diversion gates, etc.). Commanders and fighters quickly learned all the technology for building modern water conservancy projects. Entire squads and platoons of stonemasons, carpenters, blacksmiths, and bricklayers emerged in the troops. Many commanders and fighters made meritorious contributions in canal construction, and 400 people from a certain unit that built the Hami Red Star Canal alone made meritorious contributions.
　　After carrying out patriotic education to resist US aggression and aid Korea in depth in the troops, the enthusiasm of the troops for water conservancy construction has been greatly enhanced. Soldiers generally reflected: "We must use practical actions of production to resist US aggression and aid Korea!" "The Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting the US aggressors in a climate of minus 40 degrees, so what difficulties are we talking about here in production?" "The rear sweats more, and the front bleeds less." "Build the canal well so that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang can have a better life."
　　There are no difficulties in front of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They are full of confidence in the construction of Xinjiang. After 1952, some new canals and more oases will appear on the map of Xinjiang.

　　The Liberation Army Promotes Water Conservancy Construction by People of All Ethnic Groups
　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government and the influence of the People's Liberation Army's vigorous construction of water canals, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang actively built small-scale water conservancy projects.
　　The Krowati Canal in the Sixth District of Shache has been destroyed for 50 years. The local people circulated: "Whoever repairs this canal is 'Khuda' (i.e., God)." This spring plowing, the canal was finally repaired. Shufu County newly opened 36 canals of various sizes and dug 489 new springs. Atushi County newly built 34 canals of various sizes and repaired 542 old canals. Jiashi County renovated the Da Xian Canal. Yecheng newly dug more than 2,000 springs. ...
　　The water conservancy disputes of the people of all ethnic groups for many years have also been resolved in the construction of water conservancy. In the Sugeti District and Heiz District of Yengisar County, the farmers of the two villages have been manipulated and instigated by the landlord class for 30 years, competing for water and forming hatred. This spring plowing, the farmers in the Sugeti District decided to open a canal to release water to the Heiz District. Now the 30-year hatred between the farmers in the two villages has turned into unity and is as close as family.
　　The People's Liberation Army also gave great assistance to the water conservancy construction of the people of all ethnic groups. The People's Liberation Army helped the people of Wushi County complete the initial irrigation of 20,000 mu of the Yingawati Canal. When the Third District and Third Township of Yanqi County dug a new backwater canal, the People's Liberation Army stationed there immediately sent more than 100 people to help the local people dig the canal. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang thank the People's Liberation Army for building water conservancy and irrigation projects and thank the People's Liberation Army for engaging in production and construction to reduce their burden and accelerate the social and economic construction of Xinjiang. They send tea to the troops and perform ethnic dances for the troops. On the day when a large canal built by the Liberation Army in Korla was completed and released water, the people of all ethnic groups came from dozens of miles away to celebrate, sending banners and condolence items to the troops. The people of all ethnic groups regard the victory of the troops in building the canal as their own victory.
　　In the huge project of water conservancy construction, the People's Liberation Army and the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have a flesh-and-blood connection that cannot be separated.

　　新疆省规模巨大的水利灌溉工程
    本报特约记者  胡中
     兴修水利对新疆经济上的重大影响
    “有水便有地”，水是新疆人民的命根子。因此兴修水利便是发展新疆农牧业生产和工业生产的决定关键。
    新疆因为地处高原，气候干燥，全疆每年雨量平均还不到二百公厘。在天山以南的地区，甚至终年不雨，农作物完全依靠人工灌溉成长。同时，因为新疆有阿尔泰山、昆仑山、天山三大山脉，这些山脉的雪峰冰岭都在拔海四千公尺以上，春夏间高山的积雪融化成无数内陆河流，便成为人工灌溉的水源。
    新疆各族人民多少年来和大沙漠作斗争，他们开凿了一千五百多条大小渠道，灌溉了一千九百余万亩耕地。这些渠道普通每一条仅能灌溉约一万亩土地。全疆河流约有每秒四百立方公尺的经常流水量渗漏入大沙漠，没有能加以利用。如果兴办蓄水工程积蓄冬季流水和夏季洪水，新疆可靠的能供给灌溉的水量尚有每秒七百立方公尺。因大沙漠渗漏水量较多，如按每秒一立方公尺平均灌溉一万五千亩地计算，可以增加耕地面积一千零五十万亩。新疆各民族人民迫切地需要更多的水量灌溉，需要增加更多的耕地。耕地增加了便可以发展农牧业生产，大量供给工业所需要的原料。
    新疆水利灌溉工程上的一个特殊困难，便是从河流到达耕地，大多必须经过一段戈壁滩。戈壁滩土质松，水量渗漏极大（每公里渠道渗漏约为百分之三），地面坡度又陡，渠道容易被渠水冲刷而淤塞。因此，新疆的水利建设便需要有大量投资和大量劳动力兴修现代化的灌溉工程。兴修现代化的水利灌溉工程，在国民党反动匪帮统治的时候，是从来没有敢于提出和解决过的。
    中国人民解放军，进入新疆以后，一面加强国防建设，一面便展开了轰轰烈烈的生产运动。除一九五○年上半年新开和补修了能灌溉一百二十七万亩的水利工程以解决当时部队耕种土地所需水量外（其中有四十万亩水量给与各族农民使用），从一九五○年下半年开始便进行着近代化水利灌溉工程的建设。
            人民解放军的水利灌溉工程计划
    中国人民解放军驻新疆部队兴修的主要的有以下一些水利灌溉工程：
    （一）迪化红雁池水库及和平渠。红雁池水库积蓄夏冬两季乌鲁木齐河水，蓄水量为五千万立方公尺。和平渠长四十八公里，引红雁池所蓄的水量灌溉迪化、乾德县间青格达湖一带十万亩土地。全部工程需起土方约五十万立方公尺。迪化是缺粮地区，在迪化增垦耕地便可以节省大量的粮食运输费用。
    （二）焉耆解放第一渠。该渠全长八十一公里，起土方约六百万立方公尺，引开都河水灌溉开都河南岸八十万亩土地。渠水经灌溉区后流入孔雀河，联结人民解放军在库尔勒开凿的一道大渠，该渠长四十二公里，起土方约一百万立方公尺，引孔雀河水灌溉大墩子以西二十万亩土地。并且可以联结塔里木河，成为一个灌溉系统，开发尉犁以西广大荒原。
    （三）焉耆解放第二渠。渠道引入开都河水灌溉开都河北岸焉耆，和靖县间一百二十万亩土地。全长一百零五公里，起土方约三百万立方公尺。
    （四）阿克苏胜利渠。引入阿克苏河水灌溉阿克苏县沙井子以西八十万亩土地。全长为七十二公里，起土方约三百五十万立方公尺。
    （五）哈密红星渠。哈密为缺粮最严重的地区之一，红星渠引入石城子河水可以增加四万亩土地。全长三十二点五公里，约起土方二十七万立方公尺。同时将在哈密城北修建蓄水量四千万立方公尺的水库，这样灌溉面积便可增为十四万亩。红星渠渠道所经过的都是戈壁滩，渠底要完全用石块铺砌，用水泥（目前因水泥厂尚未建立，在一般工程上用代用品）填塞，以防止渗漏和冲刷，需石块七万多立方公尺。
    以上主要渠道总干渠和干渠的长度为三百八十点五公里（如连支渠和灌溉渠长度约增加一倍以上），共起土方约一千八百余万立方公尺，共灌溉四百余万亩土地。其中除迪化红雁池水库及和平渠为旧渠整修外，其他渠道都是新建设的，库尔勒的大渠已于今年五月间完工放水，其他的渠道亦已先后动工，全部土方及渠道铺砌工程在一九五二年便可以完成。各渠道龙口（渠水进口处）、拦河坝（为提高水位所筑之河坝）、进水闸、分水闸等水泥混凝土建筑工程于一九五三年即可全部完成。
    除此以外，正在兴修的尚有巴楚县红海水库，疏勒县马场水库等。计划兴修的尚有莎车长三百公里的铁里木大渠、和阗的通古斯渠等渠道。
    兴修这些水渠对新疆经济上的影响是巨大的。除了可以解决各地区粮食供应，免去巨大的运输费用和供给发展工业所需的原料（如棉、麻、糖萝卜等）以外，尚可在迪化红雁池和焉耆铁门关两地建设二万五千匹马力以上的发电厂。同时，各主要渠道的跌水有数十座，每座可供一千七百匹马力以上的水力发电。这些电力便可以供给工业的动力和电灯之用。
    人民解放军在兴修巨大规模水利灌溉工程中表现了刚强无比的毅力和伟大的英雄气概。他们甚至在去年冬季零下四十度的严寒中，水利工程也从未停止过。工程建筑上需要木料，他们在雪深入膝的天山、昆仑山中砍伐木料；需要石块铺砌渠道和修建跌水工程，他们便从数十公里以外处爆炸石块，又用人力背运；需要十字镐、镢头，他们便自己成立小型铁工厂制造镢头和十字镐；需要水泥，他们便用石灰、砖粉和粘土按比例混合，用来代替水泥（拦河坝、分水闸等尚需要用真水泥）。指战员们很快地学会了兴修现代化水利工程的全部技术。部队里出现了整班整排的石匠、木匠、铁匠、砖匠等。许多指战员们在修渠中立了功，仅修筑哈密红星渠的某部立功的就有四百人。
    在部队中深入进行抗美援朝的爱国主义教育以后，更大大提高了部队兴修水利的劳动热情。战士们普遍反映：“我们要用生产的实际行动来抗美援朝！”“中国人民志愿军在零下四十度的气候下和美国侵略军作战，我们在这里生产还讲什么困难？”“后方多流汗，前方就少流血。”“修好水渠，使新疆各民族老百姓有更好的日子过。”
    在中国人民解放军面前是没有困难的。他们对新疆建设满怀着胜利信心。在一九五二年以后，新疆的地图上将会出现一些新的渠道和更多的绿洲了。
            解放军推动了各族人民兴修水利
    在中国共产党、人民政府的领导和人民解放军大力兴修水渠的影响下，新疆各族人民积极兴修小型的水利建设。
    莎车六区柯罗瓦提渠毁坏了五十年了，当地人民中流传着：“谁修好这个渠，谁就是‘胡大’（即上帝）。”今年春耕中，终于修好了这条水渠。疏附县新开了大小渠三十六条，挖新泉四百八十九个。阿图什县新修了大小水渠三十四条，补修了旧渠五百四十二条。伽师县整修了大咸水渠。叶城新挖了泉眼两千多个。……
    各族人民多年的水利纠纷也大都在兴修水利中得到解决。英吉沙县苏盖提区和黑孜区两村农民三十年来受地主阶级的操纵和挑拨，相互争水，结成仇恨。今年春耕中苏盖提区农民决定开一条水渠放水给黑孜区，现在两村农民三十年的仇恨变为团结，亲如家人。
    人民解放军对各族人民水利建设也大力给以援助。人民解放军帮助乌什县人民完成英阿瓦提渠初步灌溉二万亩的工程。焉耆县三区三乡挖新退水渠时，驻该地人民解放军立即派了一百多人帮助当地人民挖渠。新疆各族人民感谢人民解放军兴修水利灌溉工程，感谢人民解放军从事生产建设来减轻他们负担和加速新疆的社会经济建设。他们给部队送茶水，给部队表演民族舞蹈。解放军在库尔勒修筑的一条大渠完工放水的那一天，各族人民从几十里路远的地方赶来庆祝，给部队送锦旗，送慰劳品。各族人民把部队修渠的胜利看成是自己的胜利。
    在兴修水利的巨大工程中，人民解放军和新疆各民族人民已有了血肉不能分离的联系。
