    CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau Directs Party Committees at All Levels to Thoroughly Correct the Phenomenon of Reckless Student Enrollment
    The Northwest Military and Political Committee issued a circular on July 7 to all subordinate departments and the People's Governments of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Xi'an, requiring them to "earnestly implement the State Council's unified enrollment regulations." To further implement these regulations, it issued another directive on July 31. However, the phenomenon of cadre schools and training classes in various parts of the Northwest recklessly enrolling students has not stopped, which has prevented many regular schools from completing their summer enrollment tasks. The CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau specifically instructed party committees at all levels in the Northwest region on August 2 to immediately convene relevant departments to conduct inspections and to criticize certain organs that still disobeyed the State Council and Northwest Military and Political Committee's unified enrollment regulations after receiving them. The directive clearly pointed out that cadre schools and training classes at all levels should focus on rotating training for on-the-job cadres and activists in mass movements, and may also absorb some intellectuals in the countryside. They are absolutely not allowed to recruit or co-opt high school, junior high school graduates, or students currently enrolled in schools from this year. In the event of special needs, they must report to the Provincial (Municipal) Education Bureaus for approval and formulate a plan to be handled uniformly after the regular schools open. Organs and organizations that arbitrarily recruit students from regular schools without approval will be subject to strict disciplinary action.

    中共中央西北局指示各级党委
    彻底纠正乱招学生现象
    西北军政委员会曾于七月七日通令所属各部门及陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆、西安市人民政府“切实执行政务院统一招生规定”，又为贯彻这一规定，于七月三十一日再度发出指示。但是，西北各地干部学校训练班乱招收学生的现象仍未停止，因而使得许多正规学校未能完成暑期招生任务。中共中央西北局特于八月二日指示西北区各级党委，立即召集有关部门，进行检查，对收到政务院与西北军政委员会统一招生规定后，仍不遵行的某些机关，予以批评。该指示并明确指出，各级干部学校训练班，应以轮训在职干部与群众运动中的积极分子为主，并可吸收部分在乡知识分子参加，绝不允许招收和拉用本年度高、初中毕业或在校学生；如有特殊需要时，必须报请各省（市）文教厅（局）批准，并拟订计划于各正规学校开学后统一办理。对未经批准任意在正规学校乱拉学生的机关、团体，予以严格的纪律处分。
