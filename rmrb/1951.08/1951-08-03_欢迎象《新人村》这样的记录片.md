　　Welcome Documentaries Like "New People's Village"
    Editor:
    After watching the documentary film "New People's Village," I felt very excited and received a great education and inspiration. This film completely records the process of the Shanghai People's Government transforming vagrants and beggars. Since the liberation of Shanghai, the People's Government has quickly gathered vagrants, beggars, petty thieves, pickpockets, and other people abandoned by the old society, and after initial education, sent them to the vast grasslands of northern Jiangsu to reclaim wasteland. With the help of local farmers and the leadership of cadres, they unleashed their enthusiasm for labor, and through collective labor, quickly turned the wasteland into fertile cotton fields and built the New People's Village. They all participated in production organizations and cultural studies, and their daily life was intense and pleasant. At the first National Day celebration, they also elected a group of labor models. I think the reason why "New People's Village" can provide a powerful political education is because it selected a typical fact to illustrate the policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government; the development of each section of this fact, from vagrants and beggars in old Shanghai to labor models in the New People's Village, has the strong leadership of the Party; at the same time, this film has explanations and subtitles, the selected shots are concise and appropriate, and the facts are clearly explained. Therefore, I suggest that film production departments should organize more working teams to go to various places to timely produce documentaries.

　　欢迎象《新人村》这样的记录片
    编辑同志：
    我看完记录影片《新人村》以后，感到很兴奋，受到了很大的教育和启发。这部片子完整地记录了上海人民政府改造游民、乞丐的经过。自上海解放后，人民政府迅速地把游民、乞丐、小偷、扒手之类被旧社会遗弃的人集中起来，经过初步的教育后，把他们送到苏北广阔的草原上去开垦荒地。在当地农民的帮助和干部的领导下，他们发挥了劳动的热情，以集体的劳动很快地把荒地变成了肥美的棉田，修建了新人村。他们都参加了生产组织和文化学习，每天的生活紧张而愉快。在第一个国庆节庆祝大会上，他们还选举了一批劳动模范。我觉得《新人村》之所以能给人以有力的政治教育，是因为它选择了说明共产党和人民政府政策的典型事实；这事实每一节的发展，由旧上海的游民、乞丐到新人村的劳动模范，都有着党的坚强领导；同时，这部片子有说明、有字幕，选择的镜头精简合宜，事实也交代得很清楚。因此我建议电影摄制部门应多组织工作队到各地去，及时地摄制记录片。
