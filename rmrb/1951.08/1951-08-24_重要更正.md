　　Important Correction

　　According to a letter from the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station:

　　"The article 'Labor Model Zhang Junqi's Experimental Cotton in the Suburbs of Shijiazhuang Can Produce 800 Jin of Seed Cotton Per Mu,' published on the second page of the People's Daily on August 14th, was written by Zhou Zhenhua, a promoter from our station. Because he did not conduct an actual investigation, but only based on interviews and subjective estimations, much of it does not match the facts. In order to ensure the authenticity and seriousness of the Party newspaper, in addition to having Comrade Zhou review his careless work style, we are also submitting the results of this thorough investigation for correction.

　　The high-yield cotton experiment that labor model Zhang Junqi is cooperating with our station on is one and a half mu of land, planted with half Si Zi Cotton No. 2 and half No. 4, with an average of about 1,500 plants per mu, and a target yield of 500 jin of seed cotton per mu. According to an investigation on August 16th, fifty No. 2 cotton plants have already produced an average of 26.1 bolls. Calculating 85 bolls per jin of seed cotton, each mu can yield 452 jin. If four more bolls are produced in the future, 530 jin can be harvested. No. 4 cotton has already produced 19.5 bolls. Calculating 75 bolls per jin of seed cotton, each mu can yield 390 jin. If five more bolls are produced in the future, 480 jin can be harvested. Calculated together, the two types of cotton can currently yield 421 jin, and in the future, 505 jin can be yielded. Based on the above accurate calculations, his high-yield plan can be achieved if no unexpected disasters occur in the future."

　　Editor's Note: Correspondents and all contributors should be absolutely responsible for the authenticity of the content when writing articles, and be meticulous. The primary condition for the news published in the people's newspaper is absolute authenticity. Everyone should take Zhou Zhenhua's attitude towards writing articles as a warning.

　　重要更正
    据河北省农业试验场来信称：
    “人民日报八月十四日第二版登载的‘石家庄市郊区劳动模范张君琦的试验棉花每亩可产籽棉八百斤’的稿件，系我场推广员周振华同志所写。因他未作实际调查，仅根据访问所得，由主观估计，因此多与事实不符。为了保证党报的真实性和严肃性，除已让该同志检讨其粗枝大叶的作风外，同时将此次切实调查的结果送上，请予以更正。
    劳动模范张君琦与本场合作的棉花丰产试验，为一亩半地，播种斯字棉二比及四比各半，每亩平均株数约一千五百株，每亩籽棉产量要求五百斤。根据八月十六日调查，五十株二比棉平均已结铃二六·一个。按八十五铃摘籽棉一斤算，每亩可收四五二斤。今后如再结四铃，就可收五三○斤。四比棉已结铃一九·五个，按七十五龄摘籽棉一斤算，每亩可收三九○斤。今后如再结五铃，就可收四八○斤。两种棉总起来算，现在可收四二一斤，将来可收五○五斤。由以上正确的推算，如今后不发生意外灾害，他的丰产计划是可以达到的。”
    编者按：各地通讯员和所有投稿者，在写稿时应对内容的真实性绝对负责，一丝不苟。人民的报纸所登载的新闻，首要的条件，就是绝对真实。大家应以周振华这种写稿的态度为诫。
