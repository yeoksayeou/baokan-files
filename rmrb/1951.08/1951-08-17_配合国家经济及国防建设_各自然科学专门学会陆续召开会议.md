In coordination with National Economic and Defense Construction

Various Natural Science Specialized Societies Hold Meetings Successively

In order to unite national natural science workers, coordinate with national economic, defense, and cultural construction, and combine scientific research work with the needs of the people and theory with practice, China's various natural science specialized societies have been reorganized or begun to be established under the direct leadership and assistance of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies. Up to now, there are nineteen officially registered societies, eight societies approved by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government to begin preparations, and four societies that are about to be registered for preparation. The societies that have been registered and are ready for preparations have successively convened the first National Members Representative Conference in Beijing since the end of July.

The main tasks of this conference of specialized societies are to announce the official establishment of each society, generate sound leadership structures with a mass base; determine the future work guidelines and tasks of each society based on the needs of national economic, defense, and cultural construction; understand the situation of scientific research in various regions and the problems existing in the research; conduct a detailed survey of specialized talents in various scientific departments; and, through this conference, do a good job in uniting the scientific community, so that the science of New China can better serve the people.

The Chinese Physiological Society Discussed Issues Such as Military Food Production

The first National Congress of the Chinese Physiological Society was held in Beijing from July 23rd to 26th. Thirty-three representatives attended. The main topics discussed at this conference were (1) the determination of the physiological constants of the Chinese people (i.e., the determination of health standards for the Chinese people); (2) the manufacturing of military dry rations (i.e., military food with sufficient nutrition, easy to carry, and not easily spoiled for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army); and (3) how to solve the current urgent need for physiology teachers in various medical colleges. In addition, it was resolved to continue publishing the foreign language version of the Physiology Journal and to add a Chinese version to exchange international academic and physiological knowledge.

The Chinese Botanical Society Determined the Guiding Principles of Serving Industrial and Agricultural Construction

The first National Congress of the Chinese Botanical Society was convened on July 24th and closed on July 28th. A total of fifty-two representatives from fifteen regions across the country attended. During five days of heated discussions, the conference held seminars and listened to reports from the Agricultural Research Institute, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation on the development of botany, enabling the representatives to ideologically distinguish between the old and new botany and make botany serve the people and the industrial and agricultural construction of our country. Through this conference, the representatives further realized that scientific research is inseparable from politics. On the first day of the conference (July 24th), all the attending representatives unanimously adopted an open letter to Japanese botanical scientists. The letter stated in brief: the goal of the Chinese people and the Japanese people in defending world peace is the same, and our scientists in China and Japan should resolutely unite, strive for the democratic peace of Japan, overcome the war crisis, and defend the peace of Asia.

The convening of this conference shows the new development of Chinese botany. Chinese botanical scientists will independently and autonomously intensify research work and cooperate with botanical scientists of peace-loving democratic countries all over the world to strive for the brilliant culture of mankind.

The Chinese Chemical Society Determined the Guiding Principles of Serving National Defense and Economic Construction

The first National Members Representative Conference of the Chinese Chemical Society after its re-establishment was convened on the 5th of this month and closed on the 9th. More than one hundred member representatives and observers from various regions attended. Through various reports and group discussions, the conference clarified the future guidelines and tasks of the Chinese Chemical Society, enabling chemistry workers across the country to serve the national defense, economic, and cultural construction of our country. The conference discussed how to further coordinate closely with the education and industrial sectors and studied the issue of utilizing local products. The conference also adopted the Chinese Chemical Society's work plan for the next two years, including fifteen work plan contents such as chemical education, chemical terminology, chemical history, chemical research, chemical production, chemical popularization, and industrial chemistry. In addition, in order to better carry out chemical compilation work, the conference reviewed chemical terminology and made some principled decisions and corrections.

The Chinese Medical Association Discussed How to Combine Theory with Practice to Improve Academic and Technical Levels and Other Issues

The Chinese Medical Association convened a meeting of directors of branches from all over the country from the 6th to the 11th of this month. More than sixty people attended, including the directors of thirty-eight branches from all over the country and the heads of fifteen specialized societies such as Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ophthalmology, Dermatology, Radiology, and Medical History. The meeting was presided over by Fu Lianzhang, Director of the Chinese Medical Association, and others. Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the Central People's Government's Administrative Council, and He Cheng, Minister of the Military Commission's Health Department, both attended and spoke at the meeting. The meeting listened to and discussed the summary report of the Chinese Medical Association's work over the past year by Director Fu Lianzhang, and then held group discussions on how to combine theory with practice to strengthen the improvement and popularization of medical academic and technical levels, how to cooperate with the general policy of the People's Government's health work to call on members to work hard to participate in national defense construction, and how to develop and strengthen the work of branches across the country, and made more than twenty specific resolutions. The meeting also sent a telegram to salute the health workers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. During the meeting, a special symposium was held for the International Medical Workers Conference recently planned to be held in Italy by the World Peace Council, and a telegram was sent to the Peace Council supporting the convening of the International Medical Workers Conference.
