　　Many Rural Cadres in Dehua County, Fujian Province, Acted Upon by Feudal Ideas and Failing to Implement the Marriage Law
    In Dehua County, Fujian Province, many rural cadres still hold feudal remnants of thought regarding marriage issues, preventing the effective implementation of the Marriage Law.
    Before liberation in Dehua County, girls were casually sold as commodities. When getting married, the bride's parents generally demanded "bride price" from the groom's family ranging from sixty to one hundred dan of grain. Many farmers were unable to marry because they lacked the money. Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, this phenomenon has been greatly reduced, and many young people have been liberated from the shackles of the feudal marriage system.
    However, the feudal remnants of thought among some rural cadres are still hindering the further implementation of the Marriage Law. For example, many cadres still hold erroneous ideas regarding the remarriage of widows. When Xu De, a young widow from Dingxi Township in the county, and Zhang Zhao, the man she intended to marry, went to the township government to register their marriage, the township head, Xu Xingzhu, said: "You can only register after holding a mass meeting to get the approval of the masses for your marriage." Many people also believed that if a widow remarried, it would "damage the face of the clan." Furthermore, in Jiaoxi Township, Second District, when electing women representatives, they even promoted the feudal idea of ​​"three obediences and four virtues," and selected women who conformed to "old ethics" as representatives. In some townships, many women who resisted or ran away due to oppression from their husbands or mothers-in-law were often "struggled against."
    Although the Dehua County People's Government has paid attention to this situation and is correcting it, the feudal remnants of thought among some rural cadres are still very serious. It is hoped that the Dehua County People's Government will further publicize the Marriage Law, lead the masses to fight against feudal thought, and gradually eliminate this undesirable phenomenon.

### 福建德化县不少乡村干部  封建思想作怪不执行婚姻法

　　福建德化县不少乡村干部  封建思想作怪不执行婚姻法
    福建省德化县不少乡村干部在婚姻问题上还有着封建残余思想，使婚姻法不能很好地贯彻。
    德化县在解放前，女孩子随便被当作商品出卖；结婚时，女方的父母一般要向男方索取六十担到一百担谷子的“聘礼”。很多农民就因为没有钱而不能结婚。婚姻法公布后，这种现象已大大减少，不少青年已经从封建婚姻制度的枷锁下解放出来。
    但是，部分乡村干部的封建残余思想还阻碍着婚姻法更进一步地贯彻。如很多干部对寡妇结婚问题还有着错误思想。该县丁溪乡青年寡妇许德和男方张照到乡政府登记结婚时，乡长许兴竹说：“要召开群众大会让群众批准你们结婚后，你们才能去登记。”很多群众也认为寡妇如果再结婚，就“有损本族的面子”。又如二区焦溪乡在选举妇女代表时，竟还提倡“三从四德”的封建思想，把一些服从“旧礼教”的妇女选作代表。在部分乡里，很多因受丈夫或婆婆压迫而反抗或出奔的妇女常常被“斗争”。
    德化县人民政府虽然已经注意了这种情况，并进行纠正，但部分乡村干部的封建残余思想还是很严重的。希望德化县人民政府再深入宣传婚姻法，领导群众和封建思想作斗争，逐步消除这种不良现象。
