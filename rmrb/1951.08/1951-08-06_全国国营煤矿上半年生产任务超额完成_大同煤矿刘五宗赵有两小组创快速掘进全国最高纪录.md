　　National State-Owned Coal Mines Exceed Half-Yearly Production Targets
    Liu Wuzong and Zhao You Groups at Datong Coal Mine Set New National Record for Rapid Tunneling

　　In the first half of 1951, national state-owned coal mines exceeded their production targets by 5.32%. Compared with the same period last year, the output of national state-owned coal mines increased by 8.97%. Among them, the North China region increased production by 45.84% this year, and the Central South region increased production by 24.59%.

　　This year, the safety work of national state-owned coal mines has made great achievements. Mines have established safety agencies responsible for inspection, revised the technical safety trial regulations and technical operating regulations, formulated improvement plans to increase effective air volume and eliminate natural ventilation. At the same time, the Shi Yuhai safe production movement has been widely carried out nationwide. Nearly a thousand units have responded to the challenge of the Shi Yuhai team, and many of them have become the flagships of safe production in their respective mines. As a result, the worker mortality rate in national state-owned coal mines in the first half of the year decreased by 72.2% compared with the same period last year, and the injury rate decreased by 60.6%. In order to fundamentally eliminate liability accidents and avoid avoidable accidents, mines are continuing to strengthen safety measures in all aspects.

　　The Liu Wuzong and Zhao You rapid tunneling teams of the state-owned Datong Coal Mine absorbed the advanced experience of the Ma Liuhai team and created a new national record. After the Ma Liuhai rapid tunneling team created a new national record and held a celebration meeting, many rapid tunneling teams in the major mines of Datong Coal Mine, under the call of the leadership, successively put forward the slogan "Learn from the Ma Liuhai team and strive to create a new record." At this time, in order to cultivate more advanced teams like the Ma Liuhai team in a planned way, the leadership organized a "Multi-Drift Rapid Tunneling Advanced Experience Dissemination Class" to enable everyone to learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses and learn from the experience of the Ma Liuhai team in creating new records. After this study, not only did the teams accept the advanced experience of the Ma Liuhai team, but some teams also added some new methods. In particular, the Liu Wuzong multi-drift rapid tunneling team of the First Mine and the Zhao You team of the Second Mine, immediately revised the patriotic pacts after returning from the dissemination class, improved the labor organization, and ensured that they would keep up with the Ma Liuhai team. As a result, these two teams created new national records for rapid tunneling again on the 23rd of this month. The Liu Wuzong team of the 302nd and 504th drifts of the First Mine, in a drift 3.6 meters wide and 2 meters high, a regular team of twelve people (four people in the morning, middle, and evening shifts), tunneled a total of 18.2 meters, totaling 111 tons of coal, with an average progress of 1.516 meters per work shift and an average coal output of 9.25 tons per work shift.

　　The Zhao You rapid tunneling team of the 410th and 411th drifts of the Second Mine, in a drift 3 meters wide and 1.5 meters high, a regular team of nine people (three people in the morning, middle, and evening shifts), tunneled 16.15 meters, totaling 86 tons of coal, with an average progress of 1.794 meters per work shift and an average coal output of 9.55 tons per work shift.

　　In terms of tunneling progress, the Liu Wuzong team holds the highest national record. In terms of average efficiency, the Zhao You team holds the highest national record.

　　全国国营煤矿上半年生产任务超额完成
    大同煤矿刘五宗赵有两小组创快速掘进全国最高纪录
    一九五一年上半年全国国营煤矿已超过计划百分之五点三二完成生产任务。与去年同期比较，全国国营煤矿的产量增加了百分之八点九七。其中华北区今年增产百分之四十五点八四。中南区增产了百分之二十四点五九。
    今年上半年全国国营煤矿的保安工作已有很大成绩。各矿成立了专负检查责任的保安机构，修订了技术保安试行规程和技术运行规程，制订了提高有效风量和消灭自然通风的改善通风方案，同时施玉海安全生产运动已在全国范围内广泛开展，现在向施玉海小组应战的已有近一千个单位，其中不少单位并已成为所在矿山安全生产的旗帜。因此全国国营煤矿上半年的工人死亡率比去年同期减少了百分之七十二点二，负伤率减少了百分之六○点六。为达到基本上消灭责任事故，避免可以避免的事故，各矿正在继续加强各方面的保安措施。

    国营大同煤矿刘五宗、赵有两快速掘进组吸取了马六孩组的先进经验，创造了全国最高新纪录。大同煤矿所属各大矿的不少快速掘进组，在马六孩快速掘进组创造了全国最高新纪录及召开了庆功大会以后，在领导方面的号召下，纷纷提出了“向马六孩小组学习，争取再创最高新纪录”的口号。这时，领导方面为了有计划的多培养马六孩式的先进小组，组织了“多孔道快速掘进先进经验传播班”，使大家互相取长补短，学习马六孩组创造新纪录的经验。这样经过学习后，各组不但接受了马六孩组的先进经验，而且有的小组更增加了一些新的办法，特别是一矿刘五宗多孔道快速掘进组和二矿赵有组，从传播班一回去，马上重新修订了爱国公约。改进了劳动组织，保证一定要向马六孩小组看齐。因此，这两个小组在本月二十三日，又都创造了全国快速掘进的最高新纪录。一矿三○二、五○四巷刘五宗组，在三公尺六公寸宽、两公尺高的巷道里，一个原班十二人（早、中、晚三班各四人），共掘进十八公尺二十公分，合煤一百一十一吨，每工平均进度为一公尺五十一公分六，每工平均产煤九吨二分五。
    二矿四一○、四一一巷道赵有快速掘进组，在三公尺宽，一公尺半高的巷道里，一个原班九人（早、中、晚三班各三人）掘进十六公尺十五公分，合煤八十六吨，每工平均进度为一公尺七十九公分四，每工合煤九吨五分五。
    按掘进进度来说，刘五宗组为全国最高纪录。按平均效率来说，赵有小组为全国最高纪录。
