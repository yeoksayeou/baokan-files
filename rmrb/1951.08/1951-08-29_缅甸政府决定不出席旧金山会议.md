　　Burmese Government Decides Not to Attend San Francisco Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 28th] According to a Reuters dispatch from Rangoon on the 23rd: The Burmese government has rejected the final draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty and has refused the invitation from the United States, deciding not to attend the San Francisco Conference. This decision has been communicated to the U.S. government. The Burmese government recently told the United States that "Burma cannot accept any treaty that does not provide for adequate compensation." Prior to this, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Rangoon on July 23rd, citing "well-informed sources," the Burmese government, after studying the U.S.-British draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty, had already decided not to sign the draft and not to attend the San Francisco Conference. The Burmese government made this decision because it believes that the draft treaty is not beneficial to Burma.

　　缅甸政府决定不出席旧金山会议
    【新华社二十八日讯】据路透社仰光二十三日讯：缅甸政府已经拒绝对日和约草案定本，并拒绝美国的邀请，决定不出席旧金山会议。这个决定已经通知美国政府。缅甸政府最近告诉美国，“缅甸不能接受没有规定充足赔偿的任何和约”。在此以前，据法新社仰光七月二十三日电引“消息灵通人士”说：缅甸政府在研究了美英对日和约草案以后，即已决定既不签署该草案，也不出席旧金山会议。缅甸政府采取这一决定的原因是：缅甸政府认为和约草案对缅甸无益。
