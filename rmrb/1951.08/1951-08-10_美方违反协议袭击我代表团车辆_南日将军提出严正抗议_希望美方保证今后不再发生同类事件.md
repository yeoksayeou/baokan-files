Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th: General Nan Ri, chief representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, today sent a letter of protest to Admiral Joy, chief representative of the United Nations Command delegation. The full text of the letter of protest is as follows: "To Admiral Joy, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:
    On August 7th at 15:00, one of our delegation's supply trucks, in accordance with the agreement, displayed a white cloth on the front and flew a white flag. While en route from Kaesong to Pyongyang, 6 kilometers north of Sibian-ri, it was attacked by two of your aircraft. Your aircraft circled our delegation's truck for a considerable time and strafed the vehicle twice with machine guns, causing damage to the engine and rendering it immobile. We have ample evidence to prove the above facts. During the preliminary meeting between liaison officers on July 8th, it was clearly agreed that your aircraft should not attack our delegation's vehicles displaying white flags. On July 21st, our liaison officer brought to your attention the fact that four of our delegation's transport vehicles, displaying white flags, had been attacked by your aircraft in Huangzhou, Sariwon, and other places. At that time, you reaffirmed that our delegation's vehicles displaying white flags and white cloths on the front would not be attacked. The above facts are a clear violation of the agreement between the two sides. It is worth pointing out that this is the second violation of the agreement following the shooting by your armed personnel in the Panmunjom neutral zone. I hereby lodge a strong protest with you regarding the above facts. I hope that you will guarantee that similar violations of the agreement will not occur in the future.
      General Nan Ri, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation. August 9th."

　　美方违反协议袭击我代表团车辆
    南日将军提出严正抗议
    希望美方保证今后不再发生同类事件
    【新华社开城九日电】朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军，本日以抗议书一件送致联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃将军。抗议书全文如下：“联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃海军中将：
    八月七日十五时，我方代表团供应卡车一辆，根据协议，在车头上铺有白布，并插有白旗，自开城赴平壤途中，在市边里以北六公里处，遭遇你方飞机两架。你方飞机，在我方代表团卡车上空盘旋甚久，并以机枪连续两次扫射该车，以致车头机件损毁，不能行驶。我方有充分的证据，足以证明以上事实。七月八日双方联络官预备会议中，曾明确协议，你方飞机不得袭击挂有白旗标志的我方代表团车辆。七月二十一日我方联络官曾就挂有白旗的我方代表团运输车四辆在黄州、沙里院等地遭受你方飞机袭击事，提请你方注意。当时你方再度保证，此后挂有白旗、并在车头上铺有白布的我方代表团车辆，概不受袭击。上述事实显然是对于双方协议的明白的违反。值得指出的是：这是紧随着你方武装人员射击板门店中立区以后再一次发生的违反协议的事实。我特就以上事实，向你提出严正抗议。并希望你保证今后不再发生这类违反协议的事件。
      朝鲜人民军  中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军  八月九日”
