After Reading Chairman Mao's Articles, Be Sure to Care About the Masses' Livelihood
Editor:

After studying Chairman Mao's "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, and Pay Attention to Methods of Work," published in January 1934, I deeply realized how much Chairman Mao valued the work of the masses.

Chairman Mao said: "Our central task at present is to mobilize the broad masses to participate in the revolutionary war... Whoever belittles this central task is not a good revolutionary worker." How to mobilize the masses? Chairman Mao said: "We must not be negligent or belittling of the practical interests of the broad masses, the issues of the masses' lives." The reason Chairman Mao raised this question at that time was precisely because some local governments in the Soviet area lacked sufficient understanding of the importance of this issue. This was particularly evident in the expansion of the Red Army and the mobilization of transport teams.

For example, the Tingzhou Municipal Government, in its work of expanding the Red Army and mobilizing the masses to participate in transport teams, "discussed only the expansion of the Red Army and the mobilization of transport teams at several meetings, completely ignoring the lives of the masses," while the masses were troubled by the problems of firewood, rice, oil, and salt. As a result, the representatives of the Workers' and Peasants' Congresses "were later reluctant to attend the meetings, and the meetings could not be convened." Therefore, the work "achieved very little."

However, in Changgang Township and Caixi Township, the situation was the opposite, and many people joined the Red Army. "Eighty out of every hundred young men and women in Changgang Township joined the Red Army, and eighty-eight out of every hundred in Caixi Township joined the Red Army." Why was there such a completely different situation in Changgang Township? It was because the work among the masses in these areas was done well. For example, "In Changgang Township, a poor peasant's house was burned down, and the township government mobilized the masses to donate money to help him. Three people had no food to eat, and the township government and the Mutual Aid Society immediately donated rice to help them..." Chairman Mao's style of caring for the lives of the masses has become an excellent tradition of the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army today; in particular, the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" of the People's Liberation Army fully embodies the noble qualities of the People's Army, and this quality was precisely what Chairman Mao began to cultivate from the time he established the army in Jinggang Mountain.

Therefore, I feel that every revolutionary cadre of ours should learn from Chairman Mao's style, care for the masses, and cherish the masses. Only in this way can we better serve the people.

### 读了毛主席的文章一定要关心群众生活

    读了毛主席的文章一定要关心群众生活编辑同志：
    我学习了毛主席一九三四年一月发表的《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》后，深深地体会到毛主席是怎样重视群众工作的。
    毛主席说：“我们现在的中心任务是动员广大群众参加革命战争……谁要是看轻了这个中心任务，谁就不是一个很好的革命工作人员。”怎样发动群众呢？毛主席说：“我们对于广大群众的切身利益问题，群众的生活问题，那就一点也不能疏忽，一点也不能看轻。”毛主席之所以在当时提出这个问题，正是因为苏区还有个别的地方政府对这个问题的重要性缺乏足够的认识。特别是表现在扩大红军与动员运输队方面。
    譬如汀洲市政府，他们在扩大红军和动员群众参加运输队工作中，“几次会都只讨论扩大红军和动员运输队，完全不理群众生活”，而群众则为柴、米、油、盐的问题纠缠着。其结果，工农代表会议的代表们“后来就不高兴到会了，会议也召集不成了。”因此，工作就“极少成绩。”
    但在长冈乡，才溪乡情形就相反，参加红军的人就多得很。“长冈乡成年青年男女百个人中有八十个当红军去了，才溪乡百个人中有八十八个当红军去了。”为什么长冈乡有这样截然不同的情形呢？就因为这些地区的群众工作做得好。如“长冈乡有一个贫苦农民被火烧掉了一间半房子，乡政府就发动群众捐钱帮助他。有三个人没有饭吃，乡政府和互济会就马上捐米救济他们。……”毛主席这种关心群众生活的作风，已经成为今天人民政府与人民解放军的优良传统；特别是人民解放军的“三大纪律、八项注意”充分体现了人民军队的崇高品质，而这种品质也正是毛主席从井冈山建军起即着手培养起来的。
    所以我感到：我们每一个革命干部都应当学习毛主席这种作风，关心群众、爱护群众。只有这样才能更好地为人民服务。
