With the new cotton crop about to enter the market, the Shandong Provincial People's Government Financial and Economic Committee convened a meeting of relevant departments on August 8 to study and deploy preparations for the new cotton procurement work, ensuring the full operation of spinning mills. At the meeting, the survey team first reported on the situation: although the insect plague was severe and affected output to some extent, the total output would not be reduced due to the increased application of fertilizer. This year's new cotton procurement work has many favorable conditions: (1) Cooperative organizations are relatively sound, and the organizational strength of personnel is greater than last year. (2) The purchase and storage of cotton in June, July, and August, as well as the pre-purchase work in the first half of the year, have laid a good foundation for future new cotton procurement. (3) Due to the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the patriotic ideological awareness of farmers has been improved. (4) Party and government leading cadres are personally involved, mobilization is more in-depth, and organizational strength is also greater. The meeting also analyzed the difficult conditions in this year's new cotton procurement work: (1) The living standards of cotton farmers have improved, and they have more money in hand, so they are not in a hurry to sell cotton. (2) This year's high autumn grain prices have relatively affected the cotton-grain price ratio, thus stimulating the cotton farmers' reluctance to sell. (3) The workload is heavy, not only to purchase cotton, but also to continue pest control and flood prevention, and work needs to be arranged appropriately. The meeting also made it clear that as long as we are good at leveraging favorable conditions and overcoming unfavorable conditions, completing the cotton procurement, especially completing a certain amount of cotton procurement in September, is not a problem. However, time is tight, and the task is relatively serious. Therefore, the following preparations need to be made: (1) From top to bottom, from cadres to the masses, a comprehensive publicity and mobilization work should be launched. It is required that Party committees, governments, and mass organizations at all levels carry out extensive ideological education for cotton farmers to improve their national concept and the concept of supporting industrial construction. At the same time, through the revision of patriotic pacts, cotton farmers should be educated to list selling cotton to the state as a patriotic pact. Especially among rural branch party members, communist education should be carried out to overcome selfish and backward ideas, and village cadres and party members should be called upon to take the lead in selling cotton. (2) The Provincial Cooperative General Agency and the Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company should promptly sign cotton purchase agreement contracts and print and distribute them so that lower levels can follow them to carry out new cotton procurement work. (3) In terms of organization, relevant provincial departments plan to organize a group of personnel who, after a short period of policy training, will arrive in cotton-producing areas at the end of August to begin cotton purchase work. Among them, the Provincial Cooperative General Agency will transfer more than 300 cadres. (4) In order to cooperate with the new cotton procurement work, the Department of Commerce and the Cooperative should prepare to transfer materials to meet the needs of cotton farmers. (5) Correctly unite the strength of private merchants and widely carry out procurement work. It is necessary to organize flower vendors and cotton merchants to purchase on behalf of the state and give them a certain amount of handling fees; it is necessary to organize joint operations and joint purchases to carry out procurement work in an organized manner; it is necessary to appropriately strengthen market management to prevent speculators from raising prices and the outflow of cotton. (6) A group of technical personnel should be transferred to cotton-producing areas to assist cooperatives in training grassroots personnel to learn the "grading method" in order to implement a reasonable cotton price policy. (7) Banks should establish and improve institutions in rural areas, conduct cotton single-discount savings, and absorb cotton farmers' deposits to cooperate with the new cotton procurement work. Finally, everyone unanimously agreed that it is necessary to quickly complete the preparations, seize the time, and ensure the completion of the task so that all spinning mills can operate.

　　山东周密部署收购新棉花的准备工作
    要充分发挥有利条件克服各种困难
    新棉即将上市，为做好秋后新棉收购工作，保证纱厂全部开工，山东省人民政府财政经济委员会于八月八日召集有关部门会议，研究部署新棉收购工作。会上首先由调查组汇报情况：今年虫灾虽重，应产量受到影响，但由于追肥较多，总产量还不会少。今年新棉收购工作还有许多有利条件：（一）合作社组织比较健全，人员组织力量较去年为大。（二）六、七、八月份，购棉储棉以及上半年预购工作为今后新棉收购打下了良好的基础。（三）由于抗美援朝运动的开展，农民爱国主义的思想觉悟已有提高。（四）党政领导干部亲自动手，动员较深入，组织力量也大。会上同时也分析了今年新棉收购工作中的困难条件：（一）棉农生活改善，手头宽裕，不急于出售棉花。（二）今年秋粮价高，相对地影响了棉粮比价，因而也就刺激了棉农的惜售心理。（三）工作任务重，不仅要收购棉花，还要继续除虫、防汛，工作需要适当安排。会上也明确指出：只要我们善于发挥有利条件，克服不利条件，完成棉花收购，特别在九月份完成一定数量棉花收购，还是不成问题的。但是时间又是紧迫的，任务也是比较严重的。因此，需要做好如下各项准备工作：（一）从上到下，从干部到群众，展开全面的宣传动员工作。要求各级党委、政府、群众团体对棉农展开广泛的思想教育，提高棉农的国家观念与支持工业建设的观念。同时，通过修订爱国公约，教育棉农把棉售给国家列为爱国公约。特别在农村支部党员中，要进行共产主义的教育，克服自私自利的落后思想，号召村干部和党员带头售棉。（二）省合作总社与省花纱布公司，应迅速签订购棉协议合同，并印发下去，以便下级遵照执行，开展新棉收购工作。（三）在组织方面，省级各有关部门拟组织一批力量，经过短期的政策训练后，即于八月下旬，到达产棉区开始购棉工作。其中省合作总社即调集干部三百余人。（四）为了配合新棉收购工作，商业厅、合作社即应准备调集物资，供应棉农的需要。（五）正确地团结私商力量，广泛地展开收购工作。要组织花贩、棉商为国家代购，可给予一定数量的手续费；要组织联营、联购，有组织地进行收购工作；要适当地加强市场管理工作，防止投机商贩抬价与棉花外流现象发生。（六）抽调一批技术人员，到产棉区协助合作社，训练基层人员，学习“分级方法”，以便贯彻合理的棉价政策。（七）银行在农村建立健全机构，举办棉花单一折实储蓄，吸收棉农存款，配合新棉收购工作。最后，大家一致认为，要迅速完成准备工作，抓紧时间，保证完成任务，使纱厂全部开工。
