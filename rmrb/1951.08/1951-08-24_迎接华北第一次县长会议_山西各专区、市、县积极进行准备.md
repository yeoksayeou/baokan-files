　　In preparation for the first North China County Chief Conference, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government instructed all mayors, commissioners, and county chiefs to personally organize relevant cadres to conscientiously study the construction documents designated by the North China Affairs Department; it required leading cadres in all regions to check their work in connection with reality, combine theory with practical work, and further clarify in their thinking the major relationship between the People's Representative Conference as the fundamental system of our country and political power construction for guaranteeing economic construction. It also required overcoming the erroneous ideological remnants of some comrades who "emphasize production leadership and neglect political power construction," and who believe that "good production is good politics." On this basis, they should study and summarize their work.
　　In early July, the Provincial People's Government separately convened chiefs of the civil affairs sections of each special commissioner's office to the province to report on democratic political construction and preferential treatment work, and began to study and summarize the situation and experience of the county people's representative conferences and the key counties exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress in the past six months. To this end, Wang Shiying, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, and the Director of the Civil Affairs Department led working groups to Linfen, Yuncheng, Changzhi and other places on July 18, to inspect and supervise, and also to go deep into the counties (one county per group) to conduct systematic, comprehensive, and in-depth investigations and research on the county's political construction work, and to summarize experience.
　　Currently, the preparatory work in each special district, city, and county is in active progress. After receiving instructions from the Provincial People's Government, the special districts and counties generally held political affairs meetings, and the standing committees of the county people's representative conferences conducted research and deployment. Yuci, Xinxian and other special commissioner's offices convened special district civil affairs section chiefs meetings in early July to make detailed arrangements for the preparatory work. Generally, it is divided into three steps: the first step focuses on studying the political construction documents, reviewing past work, and sorting out historical materials. The second step focuses on going deep into the masses of representatives, conducting interviews, holding symposiums, understanding and collecting the reflections and opinions of the masses of representatives, reviewing and correcting past understandings and materials. For example, in order to carry out this work in an organized manner, Taigu County decided that the head of the Industry and Commerce Section would be responsible for going deep into the industrial and commercial circles, the head of the Culture and Education Section would be responsible for going deep into the cultural and educational circles, and the head of the Civil Affairs Section and the resident representative of the Standing Committee of the County People's Representative Conference would be responsible for going deep into the regional representatives and organ representatives to listen to opinions and collect materials. Pingding County has held a forum for farmers' representatives from eight villages and a forum for specially invited representatives, which has yielded great results. The third step focuses on research and summary. Most counties have now begun to carry out this work. The secretaries of the Taigu and Pingyao County Party Committees have also personally participated in the research work and conducted summaries. At the same time, the Yangquan industrial and mining area and Pingyao County will soon convene people's representative conferences (Yangquan will also exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress). The Yuci Special Commissioner's Office has organized three working groups to go to assist in order to learn from experience.
　　In short, cadres at the special district and county levels attach great importance to the preparatory work for the North China County Chief Conference. Recently, after the People's Daily published an editorial on the work of political power construction, it further promoted the preparatory work in the province. However, there are still a few counties that have not carried it out seriously. Some counties have neither seriously studied the political construction documents nor started to summarize the work. Some county chiefs have not even read the outline of the issues for discussion at the meeting issued by the North China Affairs Department. The Provincial People's Government is now urging them to correct this.

　　迎接华北第一次县长会议
    山西各专区、市、县积极进行准备
    山西省人民政府为准备华北首次县长会议，指示各市长、专员、县长亲自动手，组织有关干部认真学习华北事务部所指定之建政文件；要求各地领导干部联系实际检查工作，使理论与实际工作相结合，并从思想上进一步明确认识人民代表会议是我们国家的根本制度和政权建设对于保障经济建设的重大关系问题，克服某些同志“重视生产领导忽视政权建设”，认为“生产好就是政治好”等错误的思想残余，并在此基础上研究总结工作。
    七月初该省人民政府曾分别召集各专署民政科长来省汇报民主建政及优抚工作，着手研究总结半年来县各界人民代表会议及重点县代行人民代表大会职权的情况和经验。为此该省人民政府副主席王世英和民政厅长已带领工作小组于七月十八日分赴临汾、运城、长治等地，一面检查督导，一面深入到县（每组一个县）对县的建政工作进行系统的全面的深入的调查研究，总结经验。
    目前各专区、各市、各县的准备工作，均在积极进行中。专区和县在接到省人民政府的指示后，大都召开了政务会议，县各界人民代表会议常务委员会则进行了研究布置。榆次、忻县等专署已于七月上旬先后召开了专区民政科长会议，对准备工作又作了详细布置。一般分为三个步骤：第一步着重学习建政文件，检查过去工作，整理历史材料。第二步着重深入群众代表中，进行访问，召开座谈会，了解与收集群众代表的反映与意见，审查并订正过去的认识与材料。如太谷县为了有组织地进行这一工作，曾决定工商科长负责深入工商界，文教科长负责深入文教界，民政科长与县各界人民代表会议常委会驻会代表负责深入区域代表、机关代表中，听取意见，搜集材料。平定县已召开了一次八个村的农民代表座谈会和特邀代表座谈会，取得很大收获。第三步着重研究总结。目前大部县份已开始进行这个工作。中共太谷、平遥等县县委书记亦均亲自参加研究工作，进行总结。同时，阳泉工矿区及平遥县最近将召开人民代表会议（阳泉并将代行人民代表大会职权）。榆次专署组织了三个工作组，前往帮助，以便吸取经验。
    总之，专区和县级干部十分重视华北县长会议的准备工作。最近人民日报发表了有关政权建设工作的社论之后，更促进了该省准备工作的进行。但仍有少数县份尚未认真进行，有的县至今既未认真学习建政文件，亦未着手总结工作，甚至有的县长连华北事务部所发会议讨论问题的提纲还未看过，现省人民政府正在督促纠正中。
