　　Wu Zhipu and Niu Peicong Achieve Remarkable Work Results
    Government Administration Council Rescinds Warning Disciplinary Action
    [Xinhua News Agency, 18th] The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has recently approved the request from the Central and South Military and Political Committee to rescind the warning disciplinary action against Wu Zhipu, Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government, and Niu Peicong, Vice Chairman. Note: Previously, due to a gas explosion accident at the Yihe and Luohe Coal Mine, the Government Administration Council issued a warning disciplinary action to Chairman Wu Zhipu and Vice Chairman Niu Peicong on June 6, 1950. In recent years, because Chairman Wu Zhipu and Vice Chairman Niu Peicong have achieved remarkable results in leading the work of Henan Province, the Central and South Military and Political Committee specially reported to the Government Administration Council to rescind their disciplinary action.

    政务院注销其警告处分
    【新华社十八日讯】中央人民政府政务院顷批准中南军政委员会关于注销对河南省人民政府主席吴芝圃、副主席牛佩琮警告处分的请求。按：前因宜洛煤矿发生沼气爆炸事故，政务院曾于一九五零年六月六日予吴芝圃主席、牛佩琮副主席以警告处分。年来，因吴芝圃主席与牛佩琮副主席领导河南省工作有显著成绩，中南军政委员会特报请政务院注销其处分。
