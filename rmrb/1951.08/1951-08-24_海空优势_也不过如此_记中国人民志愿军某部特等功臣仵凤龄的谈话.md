　　"Air and Sea Superiority" is Nothing Special
    ——An Interview with Wu Fengling, Special Class Merit Citation Recipient of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    I am a squad leader in the Volunteer Army. My name is Wu Fengling. With the support of the Chinese and Korean people, and the people of the world, our Volunteer Army has been fighting alongside the Korean People's Army to strike at the American aggressors for more than half a year. As everyone knows, our equipment is not as good as the enemy's, but we have won many victories. We have beaten the boastful American and British imperialists to a pulp, making them utterly disgraced. Now I will talk about a battle I participated in. In this battle, we three people destroyed two enemy tanks and one truck, captured nineteen enemies alive, killed and wounded more than thirty enemies, and I received the title of Special Class Merit Citation Recipient. My comrades He Xiangqiu and Yang Chunlin, who were in the same group as me, also each received a first-class merit.

    On April 22nd, just as our army's spring offensive began, on the first day, our unit broke through the Imjin River defended by the British 29th Brigade and advanced bravely to the enemy's flank, with the aim of detouring to the highway leading to Uijeongbu, cutting off the enemy's retreat, and cooperating with the frontal forces to eliminate them.

    We were overjoyed to receive the order to attack and be assigned to the first echelon. Everyone brought enough food and ammunition, climbing mountains without roads, one after another. The mountains were high and the forests were dense, and we had to fight the enemy on guard. But our marching speed was very fast, especially when descending the mountain, we ran down like flying. There was a moon in the sky, and the enemy fired flares to light our way. We traveled 150 li in two nights, directly inserting into the mountains west of Banghwang-ri.

    Less than 100 meters in front of our platoon on the hilltop, a company of enemies was entrenched. By this time, it was already dawn, and the follow-up troops had not arrived, and the artillery had not been brought up, so the company commander ordered us to monitor the enemy on the one hand and build fortifications on the other.

    The enemy knew that our force seriously threatened the security of their flank and was in danger of being surrounded and annihilated by us. So they desperately wanted to take it back. Enemy planes came to strafe, and artillery shells continued to bombard, breaking the pine trees on our position. The soil kicked up by the shells buried us, but we crawled out again, wiped the dirt off our guns, and lay down on the position to fire at the enemy. The enemy's two attacks were defeated by us.

    Towards noon, the enemies in front collapsed and retreated. The road was a dark mass of tanks, cars, and infantry all running south. The order to attack came, and the company commander designated me to lead a squad to attack. We were very happy. I immediately took the first half of the squad, and the deputy squad leader took the second half, bypassing the enemies on the opposite hilltop through a mountain gully, and charged towards the highway.

    When we reached the west side of the highway, we lay down on a high embankment. Two of the four people I brought were wounded, and the second half of the squad had not followed. But we did not feel weak. No matter how many enemies came, we would fight them, and we were determined to eliminate them. In order to punish those executioners, in order to avenge the Korean people, we were not afraid of any difficulties and dangers. The three of us lay down in this place two meters above the highway, and fired at the enemies exposed on the highway trying to escape. After several enemies fell, they retreated to the rear.

    Suddenly, we heard a rumbling sound from the north. I looked up and saw two light tanks coming. Behind them was a small jeep. I said to Comrade Yang Chunlin beside me, "Get out the anti-tank mine." Because we were well concealed, the enemy did not notice us. When the first tank approached, I leaned out and threw the anti-tank mine hard. With a loud bang, the ground shook, the tank smoked, and stopped obediently. Comrades He Xiangqiu and Yang Chunlin, who were with me, gave a thumbs up and said it was a good hit.

    The second one came. A guy stuck half of his body out of the turret, holding a machine gun, and shot at us. The three of us, two submachine guns and one rifle, aimed at this guy's chest and fired together. We saw his hand loosen, the machine gun fall to the ground, and the man fall into the car. But the tank was still moving forward. We waited for it to get close, about ten meters away, and I stood up again and threw the second anti-tank mine. The tank was wounded again, and black smoke billowed out. Perhaps the driver inside was not dead, the car was still moving forward, passing in front of us. This made us anxious. We ran out of anti-tank mines, and the distance was getting farther and farther. I quickly picked up the submachine gun and chased after it, found a few armor-piercing incendiary rounds, and shot at it a few times. The speed of this thing that was desperately trying to run slowed down, and fire rose from its rear, and finally stopped moving. We turned around and shot at the small jeep, and we also destroyed it with armor-piercing rounds.

    The three of us were very happy. We destroyed two tanks and one jeep.

    At this time, three more tanks came from the north. These three were big guys - heavy ones. Each one had twenty or thirty infantrymen sitting on it, shooting at us while charging forward. Behind them, there were thirty or forty enemies running on foot. The three of us lay down on the embankment again. Although the enemy's bullets pressed us so hard that we could hardly raise our heads, we were not flustered. We fired at the cars, knocking down many enemy infantrymen. The tanks rushed to us, which was a good opportunity to eliminate the enemy. But we had no anti-tank mines left. The two we originally brought were used up. The three of us drew out grenades, shouted "One, two," and the grenades exploded on the cars. The enemy infantrymen on the car rolled down like balls, crying and shouting. Let their own tanks crush their legs, crush their heads, and some were crushed into a ball of meat sauce. We used this method to kill many enemy soldiers sitting on the second and third tanks. At this time, we were very upset that we brought too few anti-tank mines. We couldn't penetrate the tanks with guns, because they were heavy, otherwise, these three would not have escaped.

    These three tanks passed, leaving dozens of lives to buy this road, which was considered their luck. At this time, we were going to hit the infantry running on foot behind. But when we turned our heads and looked, there was not a single enemy on the road. Strange! The three of us judged that the enemy must have sneaked into the mountain gully on the east side of the road. We jumped off the road and looked down at the edge of the gully. Sure enough, a dozen or twenty devils were bending over, carrying guns, and walking shakily. Did they think they could sneak across from us? We'll capture them alive! I immediately fired a burst of bullets at the ends of their hair with my gun. This scared the group of guys, and they all looked up. They stared at us with lost souls, throwing away their guns and cannons. Some knelt down, some lay down pretending to be dead, some covered their ears with their hands, and some covered their heads and faces. They were all cowards. Comrade Yang Chunlin, who had joined the Volunteer Army not long ago, saw the pus-filled appearance of these British soldiers and said, "How dare these bears fight us? They are quite tall, but they are such cowards when they fight!" Comrade He Xiangqiu, who was a veteran soldier, jumped down from the road and shouted "Hello! Hello!" but forgot how to say "Don't move" and "Confiscate weapons and we won't kill you" in English. I also forgot.

    Later, he gestured with his hands, asking them to put down their guns, stand up, and follow us. They followed us up one by one. The main force also came up. I met the platoon leader and handed over the prisoners. Everyone was very happy. The platoon leader said a lot of things to encourage the three of us.

    We went back together again and searched out more than ten enemies in the bridge holes, rice fields, and woods, including two Americans who could speak Chinese and Korean and were translators for the British soldiers.

    At this time, the fighting was tight in the north, the mountains shook, and it was our friendly neighboring troops who were encircling and annihilating the intercepted enemies. It was getting dark, and only the top of the mountain in the east was still red, leaving a patch of sunlight, but we did not rest. We drank some water in the river ditch, ate some fried noodles, and American canned food, reorganized the team, and chased forward again, chasing all the way to Uijeongbu.

    Comrades, although the airplanes, artillery, and tanks of the American and British imperialists are more numerous than ours, and although they like to boast and are good at boasting, in the face of the heroic Chinese and Korean People's Army, they can only suffer defeat after defeat. Now, the ceasefire negotiations in Kaesong have been going on for more than a month, and the American aggressor army lacks the sincerity of a ceasefire. They not only made many excuses to hinder the progress of the meeting, but more arrogantly wanted to push the demarcation line deep into our front lines, which can never be allowed. Truman and Ridgway, these wolf-hearted and dog-lunged things, want to find a bargain by ceasefire negotiations, which will never happen. They talk nonsense about having "air and sea superiority" and need to compensate on the ground, and want to draw the demarcation line north of the "38th" parallel. This is really shameless and shameless. Who doesn't know that when we repeatedly annihilated their army armed to the teeth, we didn't see what remarkable performance or effect the enemy's "air and sea superiority" had. I did see the role of killing peaceful residents.

    The American warmongers lack the sincerity of a ceasefire, and we must be very vigilant. If they dare to break the negotiations and continue the war of aggression, then we will more resolutely fight these robbers to the end, eliminate more of them, and drive them into the sea.

　　“海空优势”也不过如此
    ——记中国人民志愿军某部特等功臣仵凤龄的谈话
    我是志愿军里的一个班长，我叫仵凤龄。我们志愿军在中、朝人民和全世界人民的支援下，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战打击美国侵略者，已经半年多了。大家知道，我们的装备不如敌人，但是我们却打了很多的胜仗。把爱好吹牛的美、英帝国主义，打得落花流水，狼狈不堪。现在我就把我参加过的一次战斗，在这里讲一讲。在这次战斗里，我们三个人打毁了敌人两辆坦克、一辆汽车，活捉了十九个敌人，打死打伤三十多个敌人，我获得了特等功臣的称号。和我在一个组的何相裘、杨春林两同志也各立大功一次。
    四月二十二日，正是我军春季攻势开始的时候，第一天，我们这个部队就突破了英军二十九旅防守的临津江，向敌人的侧面，英勇前进，目的是要迂回到通往议政府的公路上去，截断敌人的退路，配合正面部队消灭他们。
    我们接到出击命令，并且担任第一梯队，心里有说不出的高兴。大家都带足了粮食、弹药，爬着没有道路的山，过一个又一个。山高林密，而且要和担任警戒的敌人作战。可是我们的行军速度是很快的，特别在下山的时候，都是飞一般地向下跑。天上有月亮，敌人又打照明弹给我们照着路，两夜走了一百五十里，直插到芳皇里西面的山上。
    在我们排的面前不足一百公尺的山头上，有一个连的敌人据守着。这时候天已经亮了，后续部队没有到齐，炮也没有带上，所以连长就命令我们：一面监视敌人，一面构筑工事。
    敌人知道我们这支队伍严重地威胁着他们侧翼的安全，并且有被我们包围歼灭的危险。所以就拼命想夺回来。敌机来扫射，排炮不断轰，把我们阵地上的松树都打断了，炮弹掀起的土把我们埋起来，可是我们又钻了出来，擦去枪上的泥土，又伏在阵地上向敌人射击。敌人两次进攻，都被我们打垮了。
    快到中午的时候，前方的敌人溃退下来，公路上黑鸦鸦一片，坦克、汽车、步兵一齐向南跑。突击的命令来了，连长指定我带一个班出击。我们真高兴极了，我马上带着上半班，副班长带着下半班，从一条山沟里绕过对面山头上的敌人，向着公路冲去。
    到了公路西边，我们就伏在一个高坎上。我带的四个人有两个负伤了，而下半班又没有跟上来。但我们并不感到力量单薄，不管来多少敌人，我们都要打他们，并且决心消灭他们。为了惩罚那些刽子手，为了给朝鲜人民报仇，我们是不怕什么困难和危险的。我们三个人就卧倒在这高出公路两公尺的地方，向暴露在公路上的企图逃窜的敌人扫射。敌人倒下几个之后，便退到后面去了。
    忽然听到北面一阵隆隆的声音，我抬头一看，有两辆轻型坦克来了。后面还有一辆小吉普，我对身旁的杨春林同志说：“把反坦克雷拿出来。”由于我们隐蔽得好，敌人没有发觉，等第一辆坦克靠近了，我就探出身子，把反坦克雷猛力摔过去，轰的一声响，山摇地动，坦克冒烟了，老老实实地停下不动了。跟我在一块的何相裘、杨春林两个同志伸着大拇指头，说是打得好。
    第二辆来了，有一个家伙从炮塔里露出半截身子，端着一挺机关枪，照着我们打。我们三个人两支冲锋枪一支步枪，瞄准了这家伙的胸膛一齐射击，只见他手一松，机关枪掉在地上，人也掉进车里去了。可是坦克还向前开。我们等着他靠近了，大约有十米左右，我又站起来，投出了第二颗反坦克雷。坦克又受伤了，黑烟一卷一卷地向外冒。大概是里面的司机没有死吧，车还往前开，从我们跟前过去了。这可把我们急坏了，反坦克雷没有了，距离也越来越远。我赶快提起冲锋枪追上去，找出几粒穿甲燃烧弹，照着它打了几枪，这辆拼命想跑的东西，速度减低了，屁股上冒起火来，终于停下不动了。我们掉过头来就打那一辆小吉普，结果也叫我们用穿甲弹打毁了。
    我们三个人都很高兴，我们打毁两辆坦克一辆吉普车了。
    这时从北面又来了三辆坦克，这三辆是大家伙——重型的。每一辆上都坐了二、三十个步兵，一面向我们打枪，一面向前冲，它们后面还有三、四十个敌人徒步跟着跑。我们三个人又在土坎上卧下来，尽管敌人的子弹把我们压得难抬头，可是我们并不慌张。我们向着车上扫射起来，打下来很多敌人的步兵。坦克冲到了我们跟前，这真是消灭敌人的好机会。可是我们没有反坦克雷了，原来带的两个，已经用完了。我们三人就拔出手榴弹，喝了声“一、二”手榴弹就在车上炸起来。车上敌人的步兵一球一球地滚下来，哭着、叫着。让他们自己的坦克，压去腿，压碎头，有的碾成一团肉酱。我们都用这样打法，打死了很多坐在第二辆、第三辆坦克上面的敌兵。这时我们很埋怨自己，反坦克雷带得少了，用枪打坦克打不透，因为它是重型的，不然的话，这三辆也跑不了。
    这三辆坦克过去了，放下了几十条生命买了这段路，算是他们侥幸。这时我们就要打后面的徒步跑的步兵了。可是我们掉头一看，公路上一个敌人也不见，奇怪！我们三个判断了一下，认为敌人一定钻到公路东侧的山沟里去了。我们就跳下公路，到沟边上向下一望，果然不错，一、二十鬼子都弯着腰，提着枪，摇摇幌幌地走。想从我们这里偷渡还成么？捉活的！我立刻用枪对着他们的头发梢打了一梭子。这样一来，可把这群家伙吓坏了，都仰着头。丧魂失魄地望着我们，枪也丢了，炮也丢了，有的就跪下来，有的躺下装死，有的双手掩着耳朵，有的抱着头，盖着脸，什么孬种姿势都有。杨春林是个参加志愿军不久的同志，他看英国兵这种脓包样子，就说：“就凭这些熊包还敢和我们打么？个子长的倒挺大，打起仗来这样孬！”何相裘同志，是个老战士，他从公路上跳下去，喊着“哈啰！哈啰！”但是却忘记了“不要动”，“缴枪不杀”两句英语是怎么说的，我也忘了。
    后来，他用手比划比划，叫他们放下枪，站起来，跟我们走。他们就一个个地跟着我们上来了。大部队也上来了。我见了排长，把俘虏交上，大家都很高兴，排长说了许多话，鼓励我们三个人。
    我们又一起回去，在桥洞里，稻田里，树林里，搜出十多个敌人，其中有两个是美国人，会说中国话、朝鲜话，是给英国兵当翻译的。
    这个时候，北面打得正紧，山摇地动，是我们友邻部队正在围歼被截住的敌人，天快黑了，只有东面山顶上还是通红的，留着一片阳光，可是我们不休息，在河沟里喝了点水，吃了点炒面，还有美国罐头，整了整队，又向前追击，一口气追到议政府。
    同志们，虽然美、英帝国主义的飞机、大炮、坦克车，比我们多，虽然他们会吹牛也爱好吹牛，可是他们在英勇的中、朝人民军队面前，只能接二连三吃败仗。现在，开城的停战谈判，已经进行一个多月了，美国侵略军方面，还缺乏停战的诚意。他们不但制造了许多借口以阻挠会议的进行，更狂妄的是想把分界线深入我方阵地内，这是决不能容许的。杜鲁门、李奇微这些狼心兔胆的东西，想用停战谈判找便宜，那是永远办不到的。他们胡说什么有“海空优势”，需要在地面上补偿补偿，要把分界线划在“三八”线以北，这真是厚着脸皮不知羞耻。谁不知道，当我们一次又一次地歼灭了他们武装到牙齿的军队时，我们并没有看到敌人“海空优势”有些什么了不起表现，有些什么了不起作用，杀害和平居民的作用我倒是看见过。
    美国战争贩子们缺乏停战的诚意，我们必须十分警惕。如果他们胆敢使谈判破裂，继续侵略战争，那么我们会更坚决地和这些强盗们干到底，更多的消灭他们，一直把他们赶下海去。
