　　Burmese Peace Conference Passes Resolution
    Opposing US Arming of Japan
    All-Burma Student Union Opposes US-Japan Peace Treaty
    [Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 13th] Rangoon Dispatch: The Burmese Central Committee for the Defense of World Peace passed a resolution on the 10th opposing the American imperialists' rearmament of Japan, opposing the US-drafted Treaty of Peace with Japan, and opposing the US's unilateral preparations for the "Japanese Peace Conference" to be held in San Francisco. The resolution suggests that the Burmese Parliament pass a bill opposing the US-drafted Treaty of Peace with Japan and appealing to the five major powers to conclude a peace pact.
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 12th] Rangoon News: The All-Burma Student Union Preparatory Committee issued a statement on August 7th opposing the US's unilaterally drafted Treaty of Peace with Japan. The statement, after recalling the various atrocities of rape, plunder and murder committed by the Japanese fascist army in Burma during the war, condemned American imperialism for undermining the Potsdam Agreement, rearming Japan, and conspiring to unilaterally sign a treaty of peace with Japan and refusing to allow the People's Republic of China, which had resisted the longest and sacrificed the most during the war, to participate. The statement solemnly declared: "A Treaty of Peace with Japan, without the participation of the new China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, will be completely invalid." The statement finally called on the Burmese people to unite with the people of all countries in the world and resolutely oppose the US-drafted Treaty of Peace with Japan, which endangers world peace.
