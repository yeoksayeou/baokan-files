　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th: New York—In accordance with their pre-determined fascist plan, American secret police and judicial authorities simultaneously arrested six Communist cadres in New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan on August 17th. The six arrested Communist cadres are Steve Nelson, William Albertson, Benjamin Lowell Careathers, James Dolsen, Andrew Onda, and Irving Weissman. This is the fourth time the U.S. government has arrested leaders and cadres of the American Communist Party. So far, 46 American Communist cadres have been arrested, and four more are being hunted. They were all arrested by the U.S. judicial authorities under the unconstitutional Smith Act on charges of "conspiracy to incite the violent overthrow of the government" because they advocated peace and socialism. They have been subjected to such violent persecution, especially because they strongly advocated peace in Korea and opposed the U.S. government's war of aggression.

　　According to the New York *Daily Worker*, Onda defended himself during questioning in Pittsburgh, saying, "The prosecutor says that Dolsen and I were arrested because the United States is in danger. Yes, the United States is in terrible danger. But this danger does not come from the Communist Party. This danger is caused by the war. And this danger is precisely what the Communist Party is fighting with leaflets, petitions, and mass rallies. We have the legitimate right to do what we are doing."

　　Onda declared, "The American people do not like the war in Korea." He said that the Communist Party will continue to fight for peace, "because peace is the hope of the American people. The call for peace resounds throughout the world. This is the call of hundreds of millions of people, and Wall Street cannot imprison hundreds of millions of people."

　　Onda continued, "I dedicate my life to the interests of my class—the working class. As a member of the working class, I will fight to the death and never give up thinking and speaking according to my conscience."

　　美反动派疯狂迫害美共  竟又逮捕六位美共干部
    被捕者表示决心战斗到底
    【新华社二十日讯】纽约讯：美国秘密警察及司法当局，按照预定的法西斯化计划，于八月十七日又在纽约、宾夕法尼亚和密执安三处同时逮捕共产党干部六人。被捕的六位共产党干部是史迪夫·奈尔逊，威廉·艾尔伯森，彭加明·劳威尔·卡里阿瑟斯，詹姆斯·多尔逊，安德鲁·翁达和伊尔温·魏思曼。这是美政府第四次逮捕美共领袖及干部，到此为止，美共干部已有四十六人被捕，另有四人正被搜捕中。他们都是因为主张和平及社会主义而被美国司法当局按照违宪的史密斯法，以所谓“阴谋教唆以暴力推翻政府”罪逮捕的。他们之所以遭到如此横暴的迫害，尤其是因为他们大力主张朝鲜和平、反对美国政府的侵略战争。
    据纽约《工人日报》报道，翁达和多尔逊在匹兹堡受讯时，翁达为自己辩护说：“检察官说，多尔逊和我之所以被捕，是因为美国处于危险中。是的，美国是处于可怕的危险中。但这个危险并不是来自共产党。这个危险是因战争而引起的。而这个危险正是共产党以传单、请愿书和群众集会与之斗争的危险。我们有合法的权利做我们在做的事。”
    翁达宣称：“美国人民不喜欢在朝鲜的战争。”他说，共产党将继续为争取和平而奋斗，“因为和平是美国人民的希望。和平的呼声遍于全世界。这是亿万人民的呼声，华尔街不可能把亿万人民监禁起来。”
    翁达继续说：“我把我的生命贡献与我的阶级——工人阶级——的利益。作为工人阶级的一员，我将战斗到死，决不放弃按照我的良心来思想和发言。”
