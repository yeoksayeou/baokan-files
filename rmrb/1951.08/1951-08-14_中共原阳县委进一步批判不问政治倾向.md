The CCP Yuanyang County Committee of Pingyuan Province, in order to further overcome the tendency of cadres not asking about politics and to strengthen rural political work, convened an enlarged county-wide cadre meeting in late July (including county and district cadres and some village branch secretaries, a total of more than 400 people). The meeting deeply criticized the erroneous thinking among cadres of not asking about politics and began to establish the idea of caring about politics and serving the overall political tasks in all work. Based on this idea, everyone was mobilized to formulate patriotic pacts and arrange work for August.

At this meeting, not only were the specific manifestations of cadres' tendency not to ask about politics exposed, but also the adverse consequences of this tendency were analyzed: First, due to not asking about politics, the line between the enemy and ourselves was unclear in work. Last year, when the county warehouse hired custodians, they only selected personnel from the perspective of "being able to write and calculate." As a result, four counter-revolutionaries infiltrated government departments (three have been arrested, and one has been placed under surveillance). The chief of the judicial section of the county government evaluated a section member who shielded counter-revolutionaries as "capable"; the head of a section of the county public security bureau requested the bail of his fiancée's politically problematic uncle with whom he was about to get engaged. Second, there was a lack of organization and discipline, and a tendency towards independence. The more prominent ones were cadres in the financial and economic departments and the cultural and educational departments. They emphasized: "We are specialized departments," "Our superiors have instructions and arrangements," "The Party committee does not understand our business," so they did not accept the leadership of the local Party and government. For example, when repairing the Yellow River embankment, because the food supply for 20,000 migrant workers in Yanjin was not available, the commissioner telegraphed the Yuanyang County head to rush the milling of 400,000 jin of millet in Yuanyang for support, but the director of the county warehouse said: "The county head is interfering too much. Even if I weren't afraid of being punished, I wouldn't mill it." The president of the county People's Bank said: "The bank is a business organization, we eat our own food, wear our own clothes, and the cadres are given to us by the superiors. Why does the Party committee and the government have to bother us (referring to leading him)?!" The cultural and educational assistants in various districts asked the county education section to support them in not doing central work so that they could do a good job in cultural and educational work. And some leaders of the above departments also mistakenly believed that those who did not ask about politics and buried themselves in business work were good cadres, saying: "Completing departmental tasks is completing political tasks," "Business is everything." In fact, in this case, the business was not done well either.

After this analysis and criticism, the cadres became clear-headed and realized that the tendency not to ask about politics was very dangerous, and at the same time began to realize that all specific work serves the overall political tasks, and without politics, there would be no successful business. Third, some Party members and cadres lost their direction of advancement and developed the idea of "revolutionary success." These comrades did not fully and thoroughly understand what Chairman Mao taught us: "Winning the victory nationwide is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles." Their understanding of the essence of American imperialist aggression was not yet comprehensive or thorough, so they mistakenly thought that "the revolution has succeeded," "the world is at peace," and thus stagnated and became shortsighted villains, unable to see the great future of the revolution, thinking that "now things are good, we can enjoy ourselves." Some even said: "I serve the people, who serves me?" Comrade Chen Siming of the Youth League Committee of the First District took the Party constitution and asked the Party for a position, saying: "The Party constitution stipulates that one can be a member of the district committee after one year of Party membership. I have been a Party member for three years, why haven't I been promoted?" Individual cadres even lost their revolutionary stance and became corrupt. For example, the grain bureau had five embezzlement incidents in the past year, with about 5,000 jin of millet being embezzled. The leading comrades of the county tax bureau reflected and said: "In the past, the tax bureau only focused on business and simply collected taxes. As a result, we clashed with merchants last year and almost closed the market. Later, under the leadership of the Party committee, we conducted persuasive education to the merchants and improved their political awareness. As a result, not only did we eliminate antagonistic emotions, but also increased tax revenue. This shows how important political and ideological education is." The responsible cadres of the county bank said: "The business income of the county bank has increased fifty times compared with the previous year, mainly due to mobilizing the masses, developing production, and connecting urban and rural areas; without political leadership, business work is difficult to carry out." Several district committees also examined the one-sided approach of leading central work in isolation without guiding departmental business, and realized that central work must be closely coordinated with the specific business of various departments, and neither should be neglected.

After all the cadres clearly recognized the importance of caring about politics, they further realized that the style of coercion and command was also an error of losing one's stance and violating political principles.

Based on the above ideological awareness, the county party committee, in accordance with the spirit of "strengthening rural political work," and in conjunction with the specific circumstances of resisting America, aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the bumper harvest movement, made an enlightening report. Then, it organized everyone to focus on discussing the current ideological situation of various classes and the new conspiratorial activities of counter-revolutionaries, and arranged work for August. Finally, everyone signed patriotic pacts and generally proposed to strengthen political study and pay attention to political issues.

　　中共原阳县委进一步批判不问政治倾向
    张超　郭超　王玉堂　夏福庭
    中共平原省原阳县委会，为了进一步克服干部中不问政治的倾向，加强农村政治工作，于七月下旬召开了一次全县扩大干部会议（包括县、区干部与一部分村支部书记，共四百余人）。会上较深刻地批判了干部中存在的不问政治的错误思想，开始树立起关心政治、一切工作服务于总的政治任务的思想。在这个思想基础上发动大家制订了爱国公约，布置了八月份工作。
    在这次会上，不仅揭发了干部中不问政治倾向的具体表现，并分析了这种不问政治倾向所产生的恶果：第一，由于不问政治，在工作中就表现了敌我界限不清。去年县仓库雇用看管人员时，只是从“会写会算”的观点去选择人员。结果有四个反革命分子混进了政府部门（三人已被押，一人已被管制）。县政府司法科长对一个包庇反革命的科员的评价是“有能力”；县公安局的一个股长，要求保释和自己即将订婚的女人的有政治问题的舅父。第二，无组织无纪律，闹独立性。其中较突出的是财政经济部门与文化教育部门的干部。他们强调：“我们是专业化部门”、“我们的上级有指示、有布置”、“党委不懂我们的业务”，因此他们不接受当地党的领导和政府的领导。如修复黄河堤时，因延津两万民工的食粮供应不上，专员即电示原阳县长在原阳赶碾四十万斤小米支援，但县仓库主任说：“县长管的太宽，不是怕受处分就不给碾。”县人民银行行长说：“银行是营业机关，吃的是自己的，穿的是自己的，干部是上级给的，为啥党委和政府非来找麻烦不行（指对他进行领导）？！”各区的文教助理员要求县教育科给他们撑腰不作中心工作，才能把文教工作作好。而以上部门有些领导人，亦错误地认为不问政治，埋头于业务工作的人是个好干部，并说：“完成部门任务就是完成了政治任务”、“业务就是一切”。其实在这种情况下，业务同样是没有搞好的。
    经过了这种分析批判，使干部的头脑清醒起来，认识了不问政治的倾向是非常危险的，同时也开始体会到一切具体工作都是为着总的政治任务服务的，离开了政治就不会有成功的业务。第三，部分党员与干部迷失了前进的方向，产生了“革命成功”的思想。这些同志不了解毛主席所教导我们的话：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征的第一步。”他们对美帝国主义侵略本质的认识还不全面，还不彻底，因此误以为“革命成功了”，“天下太平了”，因而停滞不前，变成了鼠目寸光的小人，看不见革命的远大前途，认为“现在可好了，可以享受了”。甚至有的说：“我为人民服务，谁为我服务？”一区青委会陈思明同志拿着党章向党要地位说：“党章规定有一年党龄就能当区分委委员，我已有三年党龄，为啥不提拔我？”也有个别干部因此丧失革命立场，贪污腐化。如粮食局一年来先后发生五次贪污事件，被贪污小米达五千斤左右。县税务局领导同志反省说：“过去税局光钻业务，单纯收税，结果去年和商人闹顶了，几乎罢了市。后来在党委领导下向商人进行了说服教育，提高了商人的政治觉悟，结果不但消除了对抗情绪，还增加了税收。这说明政治思想教育工作是何等的重要。”县银行的负责干部说：“县银行业务收入较前年增加了五十倍，主要是由于发动了群众，发展了生产，沟通了城乡关系；没有政治领导，业务工作是难于开展的。”好几个区委也检查了孤立地领导中心工作，不指导部门业务的片面作法，认识到中心工作必须和各部门的具体业务密切配合进行，不可偏废。
    全体干部明确认识了关心政治的重要性以后，就进一步认识到强迫命令作风也是失掉立场、违反政治原则的错误。
    在上述思想觉悟的基础上，县委又根据“加强农村政治工作”的精神，结合了抗美援朝、镇压反革命、丰产运动的具体情况作了启发报告，接着即组织大家着重讨论了各阶层当前的思想情况和反革命分子的新阴谋活动，布置了八月份工作。最后大家又订了爱国公约，普遍提出要加强政治学习，注意政治问题。
