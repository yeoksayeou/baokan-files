East China Military and Political Committee
Directive on Conscientiously Implementing the Marriage Law

　　For the past year, people's governments at all levels have carried out propaganda on the Marriage Law among the broad masses of working people in urban and rural areas, and have reasonably handled many marriage dispute cases, achieving preliminary results and experience in implementing the Marriage Law. However, abolishing the feudal marriage system and establishing a new democratic marriage system requires a long-term process of ideological education and concrete transformation. After the completion of land reform, the consciousness of the broad masses has increased, and they are increasingly dissatisfied with the remaining feudal marriage system, resulting in an increase in family and marriage disputes. People's governments at all levels have not paid enough attention to this phenomenon, or have not dealt with it in a timely manner even after discovering the problem, or the handling has not been fair and appropriate. Therefore, conscientiously and correctly implementing the Marriage Law remains a major political task for people's governments at all levels. For this reason, the following instructions are given:

　　(1) The basic spirit and purpose of the Marriage Law are to "abolish the feudal marriage system of arranged and forced marriages, male superiority, and disregard for the interests of children; and implement a new democratic marriage system of free marriage for both men and women, monogamy, equal rights for men and women, and protection of the legitimate interests of women and children" (see Article 1 of the Marriage Law). In order to correctly grasp this spirit, leading cadres and all staff members of people's governments at all levels must conscientiously study the Marriage Law, deeply understand the great significance of the Marriage Law for the construction of a new democratic society, correct their understanding of the Marriage Law, eliminate prejudices such as male chauvinism, and adopt a serious attitude towards their own marriage issues, abide by the provisions of the Marriage Law, and set an example. If individual cadres violate the Marriage Law and interfere with the freedom of marriage for men and women, resulting in injury or death to those interfered with, they shall be resolutely and severely punished according to law.

　　(2) In order to smoothly promote the Marriage Law among the masses, propaganda and education work must be done well. People's governments at all levels should appropriately combine various tasks and movements, organize various propaganda forces, and use various propaganda methods to continue to carry out in-depth and extensive propaganda of the Marriage Law in cities, rural areas, government offices, troops, schools, and factories, so that it is known to every household and everyone. Marriage cases that have been correctly handled are themselves good educational materials and should be combined with the spirit of the Marriage Law to conduct in-depth publicity and explanation among the masses.

　　(3) At present, the feudal marriage system still exists seriously in various places, especially in rural areas. People's governments at all levels should, according to the actual conditions in various places, reform the feudal marriage customs step by step and practically, and plan to promote and establish a new marriage system. The principles of equality between men and women, freedom of marriage, family unity, mutual assistance and love, labor and production, raising children, and striving together for family happiness and the construction of a new society in a new democratic society should be universally promoted so that they become the prevailing atmosphere. Feudal evils such as "bigamy," "concubinage," "child brides," and "waiting-for-husband daughters-in-law" should be dealt with appropriately by strengthening education according to the circumstances to prevent recurrence. The bad behaviors of "renting wives," "mortgaging wives," "bride kidnapping," and "interfering with the freedom of widows to marry" that remain in a few areas should be strictly prohibited by the people's governments of the areas where they occur. The evil acts of "releasing eagles" [loan sharking], "trafficking in women," and forcibly occupying, persecuting, and abusing women should be severely punished.

　　(4) All localities should handle marriage disputes in a timely and correct manner. When handling these disputes, a serious, prudent, investigative, and responsible attitude of researching, studying, and resolving problems reasonably must be adopted; attention must be paid to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women and children; and feudal views toward women's legitimate demands for marriage and divorce must be opposed. Phenomena such as misinterpreting the Marriage Law, marrying and divorcing easily, and neglecting the education of children while only considering divorce should be given education and criticism. When handling marriage cases, representatives of women's organizations should be absorbed to participate in and sit on the jury, and the public should be allowed to express their opinions.

　　(5) People's governments at all levels should take the implementation of the Marriage Law as one of their important daily tasks, closely grasp guidance and inspection, promptly sum up experience, and correct deviations. It is wrong to adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards the implementation of the Marriage Law; however, it is equally wrong to simply use coercion and command without proceeding from reality. Both should be prevented in advance.

　　华东军政委员会
    关于认真贯彻婚姻法的指示
    一年以来，各级人民政府对城乡广大劳动人民进行了婚姻法的宣传，合理地处理了许多婚姻纠纷案件，取得了执行婚姻法的初步成绩和经验。但废除封建的婚姻制度，建立新民主主义的婚姻制度，须要经过长期的思想教育和具体的改造过程，土地改革完成后，广大群众觉悟提高，对残存的封建婚姻制度愈益不满，家庭和婚姻纠纷增多，各级人民政府对此现象，尚未引起足够注意，或虽已发现问题而未及时予以处理，或处理而不够公平恰当。因此，认真地正确地贯彻执行婚姻法，仍是各级人民政府当前的重大政治任务。为此，特作如下的指示：
    （一）婚姻法的基本精神和目的，是“废除包办强迫、男尊女卑、漠视子女利益的封建主义婚姻制度。实行男女婚姻自由、一夫一妻、男女权利平等、保护妇女和子女合法利益的新民主主义婚姻制度”（见婚姻法第一章第一条）。为了正确掌握这一精神，各级人民政府领导干部和全体工作人员必须认真学习婚姻法，深刻体会婚姻法对新民主主义社会建设的重大意义，端正对婚姻法的认识，清除男尊女卑等偏见，对自己有关的婚姻问题，尤应采取严肃态度，遵守婚姻法规定，以身作则。如有个别干部破坏婚姻法，干涉男女婚姻自由，因而造成被干涉者之伤害或死亡者，应坚决依法严加惩处。
    （二）为了在群众中顺利推行婚姻法，必须做好宣传教育工作。各级人民政府应适当结合各种工作和运动，组织各种宣传力量，运用各种宣传方法，在城市、农村、机关、部队、学校、工厂中继续深入广泛展开婚姻法的宣传，做到家喻户晓，人人皆知。凡已正确处理的婚姻案件，其本身就是很好的教育材料，应结合婚姻法规定的精神在群众中进行深入的宣传解释。
    （三）目前封建婚姻制度在各地特别是在农村中仍严重存在，各级人民政府应根据各地实际情况，有步骤地切实地改革封建的婚姻习俗，并有计划地提倡和建立新的婚姻制度。对男女平等、婚姻自由、家庭团结、互助互爱、劳动生产、抚育子女、为家庭幸福与新社会建设而共同奋斗等等新民主主义社会中夫妻关系的原则，应予普遍提倡，使之形成风气。对“重婚”、“纳妾”、“童养媳”、“等男媳”等封建恶习，应分别情况，加强教育，妥善处理防止再犯。少数地区残存的“租妻”、“典妻”、“抢亲”、“干涉寡妇婚姻自由”等恶劣行为，应由所在地区的人民政府依法严加禁绝。对“放鹰”、“贩卖妇女”和强占、迫害、虐杀妇女等恶霸行为应严加惩办。
    （四）各地应及时地正确地处理婚姻纠纷。处理时，必须采取严肃慎重调查研究合情合理解决问题的负责态度；注意保护妇女和子女的合法权益；反对用封建观点去看待妇女所提出的结婚与离婚的正当要求。对某些曲解婚姻法，轻易结婚离婚，以及只顾离婚忽视子女教育问题等现象，都应给予教育和批评。处理婚姻案件，应吸收妇女团体的代表参加和陪审，同时允许旁听群众提出意见。
    （五）各级人民政府应将贯彻执行婚姻法作为日常重要工作之一，抓紧指导检查，及时总结经验，纠正偏向。对实行婚姻法采取放任自流是不对的；但不从实际出发，单纯强迫命令，同样是不对的，二者都应预先防范。
