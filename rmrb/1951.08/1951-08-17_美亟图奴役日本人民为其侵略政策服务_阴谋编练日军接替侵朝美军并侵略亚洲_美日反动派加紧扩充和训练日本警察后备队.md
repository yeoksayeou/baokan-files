Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: Tokyo Report: It is rumored that US imperialism is plotting to organize 100,000 Japanese troops to replace the US troops invading Korea after concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan. It is also planning to form another 250,000 Japanese troops in preparation for invading various parts of Asia. According to a Japan United Press report in early July, French General Staff intelligence suggests that the US Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff drafted a plan between April and May of this year to have Japanese troops replace US troops invading Korea. This plan was based on a suggestion made to the US government by MacArthur before his dismissal, drafted by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Bradley and Army Chief of Staff Collins, and has been approved by Truman and supported by the State Department.

According to a report from Dentsu News Agency based on reliable sources, the above plan was made on the premise that Japan could openly participate in the Korean War after the conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Japan. The first step is to complete the organization of 100,000 Japanese troops, composed of the Police Reserve Force and former professional soldiers, into a "Volunteer Army" before November of this year, to replace 100,000 US troops invading Korea. One of the purposes of US Secretary of Defense Marshall's visit to Japan on June 8 was to urge the implementation of this plan. The second step is: In order to invade the Asian continent, the plan is to organize and train a 250,000-strong Japanese "Expeditionary Force," divided into a "Southern Army" and a "Northern Army," both equipped with tank units and artillery units, and formed by former professional soldiers and former Japanese prisoners of war repatriated from Southeast Asia.

The highest organ of the "Expeditionary Force" is the "Japanese General Staff," attached to the US military headquarters in Japan. The following war criminal fascist military personnel are participating in the General Staff's work: Kazushige Ugaki, Takayoshi Tanaka, Torashiro Kawabe, Seizo Arisue, and Sadaichi Shimomura. Its operational guidance section is divided into four departments: Operations, Planning, Intelligence, and Combat Training. Former Commander of the China Expeditionary Army and war criminal Neiji Okamura has been appointed as Commander of the "Northern Army," and former Commander of the Burma Expeditionary Army and war criminal Shozo Kawabe has been appointed as Commander of the "Southern Army."

Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: TASS, 14th Dispatch: Tokyo Report: The US military headquarters stationed in Japan has completely controlled the Japanese Police Reserve Force. Recently, the Police Reserve Force and the US military conducted joint operations during exercises in Fukuoka Prefecture. Ridgway personally supervised the combat training of the reserve force. On August 2, he participated in the reserve force's exercise in Narashino, Chiba Prefecture. On August 9, Ridgway flew to Wakayama (transliteration), the location of the reserve force's officer training school.

It is pointed out that some units of the Police Reserve Force have already gone to Korea. For example, on March 21, some units stationed in Fukuoka Prefecture received an emergency order, supposedly to be transferred to Nagasaki and Kagoshima. However, these units have not been heard from since. The soldiers' families say that they have been transferred to Korea.

The US authorities and the Japanese government are drafting plans to greatly increase the number of the Police Reserve Force. The commander of the reserve force is requesting an appropriation of 55 billion yen from this year's supplementary budget. He said that the reserve force should first be increased to 125,000 people, and then to 200,000 people in the future. The printing workers' newspaper "Printing and Publishing Labor News" recently reported that 1.5 million application forms for joining the Police Reserve Force have already been printed at the "Hosokawa" printing factory.

The US occupation authorities and the Japanese government intend to purge the reserve force, removing all those suspected of being "unreliable." Anti-war and anti-American sentiments are quite prevalent among the personnel of the reserve force, and there have been incidents of desertion. Even the reserve force headquarters admits that approximately 8,000 people have already deserted.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: Tokyo Report: The US military stationed in Japan will build new barracks in Hokkaido, deciding to remain in Japan for a long time. According to a report in the US military's Pacific Stars and Stripes on July 18, Brigadier General Webber, commander of the US military station in Japan, issued a statement after inspecting Hokkaido, saying that in addition to the existing Chitose Barracks and Crawford Barracks, the US military stationed in Japan is currently planning to build two new barracks in Hokkaido to be used as winter barracks for the 45th Infantry Division.

Most of the new barracks will be composed of reinforced concrete buildings, and 45 Japanese engineers are currently stepping up the production of blueprints, which are scheduled to be completed before October 1. This is further proof that the US military is preparing to station troops in Japan for a long time.

　　美亟图奴役日本人民为其侵略政策服务
    阴谋编练日军接替侵朝美军并侵略亚洲
    美日反动派加紧扩充和训练日本警察后备队
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：传美帝国主义阴谋在缔结单独对日和约以后，编组十万日军接替侵朝美军，并计划另组二十五万日军，准备侵略亚洲各地。据七月初日本联合通讯社报道：据法国参谋部所获情报，美国国防部与参谋长联席会议已于本年四、五月间拟定一个以日军接替侵朝美军的计划。该计划系根据麦克阿瑟被撤职前向美国政府所提出的建议，由参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷及陆军参谋长柯林斯所草拟，并已得到杜鲁门的批准和国务院的支持。
    另据电通社由可靠方面所获消息：上项计划系以在单独对日和约缔结后，日本可以公开参加朝鲜战争为前提而制成的。其第一个步骤，是在本年十一月前完成以警察后备队及旧职业军人所组成的“义勇军”，编组十万日本军，以接替十万侵朝美军。六月八日美国国防部长马歇尔访日目的之一，即为督促实现这一计划。第二个步骤是：为了对亚洲大陆进行侵略，计划编组与训练二十五万日本“派遣军”，分为“南方军”及“北方军”两部，均配备坦克部队及炮兵队，以旧职业军人及由东南亚遣回之前日军俘虏编组成立。
    该“派遣军”的最高机关是附属于驻日美军总部的“日本参谋部”。参加参谋部工作的有：宇垣一成、田中隆吉、河边虎四郎、有末精三、下村定等战犯法西斯军人。其作战指导部分为作战、计划、情报、战斗训练四部。前中国派遣军司令战犯冈村宁次被任命为“北方军”司令，前缅甸派遣军司令战犯河边正三被任命为“南方军”司令。
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社十四日讯：东京消息，驻在日本的美军司令部，已完全控制了日本警察后备队。最近在福冈县举行演习时，警察后备队与美军联合行动。李奇微亲自督导后备队的战斗训练。八月二日，他参加了后备队在千叶县习志野地方的演习。八月九日，李奇微飞赴后备队军官训练学校的所在地和歌山（译音）。
    据指出：警察后备队有些部队已赴朝鲜。例如，在三月二十一日，驻在福冈县的有些部队奉到紧急命令，据说是调到长崎和鹿儿岛去。但是，此后这些部队便没有音讯了。兵士们的家属说：他们已被调往朝鲜。
    美国当局与日本政府正在草拟大量增加警察后备队的人数的计划。后备队长官要求从今年的追加预算中拨款五百五十亿日圆。他说：后备队先要增加到十二万五千人，将来再增至二十万人。印刷工人的报纸《印刷出版劳动报》最近报道，在“细川”印刷所，已经印就了一百五十万份参加警察后备队的报名表格。
    美国占领当局与日本政府打算清洗后备队，把一切有“不可靠”的嫌疑的人们清除掉。后备队人员中相当普遍地存在着反战和反美的情绪，并发生过开小差的事件。甚至后备队司令部也承认约有八千人已经走掉了。
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：驻日美军将在北海道建筑新兵营，决定长期留驻日本。据七月十八日美军太平洋星条报报道，驻日美军兵站司令韦伯尔少将于视察北海道后发表声明说：驻日美军在北海道除已有之千岁兵营及克劳福德兵营外，现正计划建设新的兵营两处，以供给第四十五步兵师作为冬季兵营之用。
    新兵营大部分将由钢骨水泥的建筑物组成，现正由四十五名日本工程师加紧制造蓝图，预定在十月一日以前完成工程。这是美军准备长期驻扎日本的又一证明。
