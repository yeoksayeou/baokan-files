To the Editor:

On July 22nd, I went to the Beijing Guang Le Society on Wangfujing Street to buy a harmonica. The "Red Star Guoguang" harmonica was priced at 35,000 yuan each. I asked them why it was so expensive, and a tall shop assistant replied, "It includes a five percent ×× donation and a × percent Resist America, Aid Korea donation." I questioned him, "Is it your donation? Or are you asking the buyer to donate?" He smiled without answering. Later, I bought two for 34,000 yuan each (I still have the receipt). In fact, this price is also relatively high. For example, on July 27th, Comrade Wang Gang from my department bought the same harmonica at the state-owned department store for only 28,000 yuan each.

Donating airplanes and cannons to Resist America, Aid Korea is a conscious patriotic action of the people across the country, but the shop assistant of Beijing Guang Le Society slanders it as a "Resist America, Aid Korea donation," turning the people's patriotic donation into an apportionment and using it as an excuse to pass it on to customers to raise prices. This will spread a very bad influence among the masses. Whether other private stores in Beijing also have this situation is worth the attention of the city's Federation of Industry and Commerce and the store employees' union for in-depth inspection.

### 北京广乐社店员  歪曲爱国捐献散布不良影响  有关部门应注意深入检查

   北京广乐社店员
   歪曲爱国捐献散布不良影响
   有关部门应注意深入检查编辑同志：
    七月二十二日我到王府井大街北京广乐社买口琴。该社的红星国光口琴索价三万五千元一支。我问他们为什么这样贵，一个高个子店员回答说：“加有百分之五的××捐和百分之×的抗美援朝捐。”我质问他：“是你们捐献呢？还是叫买者捐献呢？”他笑而不答。后来我以三万四千元一支的价格买了两支（我还保存有发票）。实际上这个价格也是较高的，如七月二十七日，我部王岗同志在国营百货公司买的同样口琴却只二万八千元一支。
    抗美援朝捐献飞机大炮，是全国人民自觉的爱国主义的行动，而北京广乐社的店员却污蔑之为“抗美援朝捐”，把人民的爱国捐献说成摊派，并用来转嫁在顾客身上，以此为借口抬高物价，这会在群众中散布极坏的影响。北京其他私营商店是否还有这种情形，值得本市工商联合会及店员工会注意深入检查。		 李漱
