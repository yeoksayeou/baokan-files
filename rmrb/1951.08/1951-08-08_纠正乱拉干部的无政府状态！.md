Correct Anarchy in Randomly Recruiting Cadres!
    Private Longshun Construction Company Randomly Recruiting Technical Personnel Should Compensate for Losses and Publicly Examine Mistakes Editor:
    Tianjin Private Longshun Construction Company, anxious to rush a certain project, used private connections to poach technical personnel He Yifeng, Yan Kezhi, Wang Mo, and others from the public-owned Anshan Engineering Company in Anshan. This caused He Yifeng and others to abandon the shock project task they were undertaking at Anshan Engineering Company, affecting the completion of the entire project and causing significant fluctuations in the morale of local employees. It was found that Longshun Construction Company's employment of personnel was done without applying to the labor introduction office beforehand, nor did it make any declaration afterward. At the same time, He Yifeng and others did not have residential household registration certificates after arriving at the factory. This behavior violates the unified labor introduction policy and disregards public security household registration laws. We believe that Longshun Construction Company should send the three poached individuals back to their original posts and be responsible for compensating Anshan Engineering Company for the losses incurred on the project due to the abandonment of their duties. They should also publish a statement of repentance and apology in the newspaper. The public security bureau should handle the part of illegally housing unregistered residents according to law. At the same time, when the relevant government departments went to Longshun Construction Company to investigate, Secretary Liu and Comrade Zhang of the Hebei Province Tianjin Prefecture Office in the factory yard not only did not help to criticize the factory's errors but instead came forward to defend it. They should also conduct a deep self-criticism for this. This case has now been transferred to the city court for handling.

     Jiangxi Water Conservancy Bureau Assistant Engineer Wang Shiji Should Not Use Private Connections to Find Work Editor:
    Comrade Wang Shiji, our bureau's former assistant engineer, left his job privately on February 28 without making any work handover. After our inquiries, we learned that Wang was introduced to work at the First Engineering Office of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Department through the private connections of Cai Fangyin, the dean of the Engineering College of Nanchang University and consultant to the Central Heavy Industry Department. We believe that: (1) Wang Shiji sought work through private connections without organizational approval; (2) the Basic Construction Bureau casually employed an on-the-job cadre without investigation; (3) Cai Fangyin engaged in private enticement and introduction. These all demonstrate unorganized and undisciplined actions. We hope they conduct self-criticism to educate everyone and eliminate this unhealthy trend.

            Guangzhou Private Guanghua Medical College Should Correctly Handle the Problem of Randomly Recruiting Cadres Editor:
    Xu Huasheng and Huang Hongjun, two doctors from our Fushun Mining Bureau Hospital, abandoned their posts on July 21 and privately fled back to Guangzhou Private Guanghua Medical College to take up positions there. Xu and Huang were originally students of Guanghua Medical College, recruited from within the customs and assigned to our hospital by the Northeast People's Government. However, Guanghua Medical College repeatedly used the school's name to send telegrams to Xu and Huang, enticing them to return to work at the school. After learning about this, our hospital informed Xu and Huang that any job transfers must go through the organizational system. However, Xu and Huang did not listen to the hospital's advice and privately abandoned their posts and fled. I hope that the relevant departments of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government will help Guanghua Medical College correctly handle this matter and correct the hospital's unorganized and undisciplined practices.

            Northwest Art Institute Should Not Privately Recruit Cadres from the Northeast Museum Editor:
    Someone named Kuang Fu from the Northwest Art Institute, without going through the organizational system, repeatedly wrote letters privately to recruit Comrade Yan Wanzhang, a cadre from our department, to work at the school. Last winter, Kuang Fu wrote a letter to recruit Yan Wanzhang. At that time, after our persuasion and education, he did not leave his job. However, recently Yan Wanzhang has been unsettled at work because he received another letter from Kuang Fu recruiting him to work in the Northwest. If this kind of private activity and random recruitment of cadres is not strictly corrected, it will affect our country's construction work.

    Trade Union Chairman Tong Xiangwen of the Xinhe Materials Factory of the Ministry of Railways Violated Organizational Principles in Employing Cadres Editor:
    Last August, when the trade union of the Xinhe Materials Factory of the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways recruited library administrators, Wang Shuying, a primary school teacher from a village in Raoyang County, applied and was accepted without organizational approval because she was visiting relatives in Tianjin during her summer vacation. After the county head of Raoyang learned about this, he wrote a letter to the factory trade union, asking Wang Shuying to return to her original post. However, Comrade Tong Xiangwen, the chairman of the grassroots trade union of the materials factory, repeatedly argued against the Raoyang county head's letter in the name of the trade union, in an attempt to shield Wang Shuying's organizational and disciplinary mistakes. Wang Shuying is a member of the Communist Youth League, and the original Youth League branch urged her to go back to complete the transfer procedures. Comrade Tong Xiangwen, fearing that she would not transfer back if she returned, said, "We don't want it (referring to her Youth League membership), it doesn't matter." This May, Comrade Tong Xiangwen was transferred to the directly subordinate trade union as the deputy director of the cultural and educational department. He disregarded the needs of the materials factory trade union library and transferred Wang Shuying to work in the directly subordinate trade union. As far as I know, Tong Xiangwen treated Wang Shuying's employment and transfer in this way entirely to achieve his own romantic purposes. We believe that Tong Xiangwen should deeply examine his selfish, non-proletarian thoughts.

　　纠正乱拉干部的无政府状态！
    私营隆顺营造厂乱拉技术人员应赔偿对方损失公开检讨错误编辑同志：
    天津私营隆顺营造厂因急于赶作某项工程，乃通过私人关系，将东北鞍山市公营鞍山工程公司技术人员何一峰、阎克志、王墨等三人拉去。使何一峰等三人，弃掉鞍山工程公司正在进行的突击工程任务，影响全部工程的完成，并造成当地职工情绪的很大波动。查隆顺营造厂资方用人，事先未向劳动介绍所申请，事后亦未声明，同时，何一峰等至该厂后，亦无居住户口证明。这种行为，违反了劳动力统一介绍政策，并玩忽公安户口法令。我们认为隆顺营造厂应将拉来的三个人送回原岗位，并负责赔偿鞍山工程公司因该三人弃职在工程上所受之损失，登报悔过道歉，对于私自留住无户口居民部分，则由公安局依法处理。同时，当政府有关部门至隆顺营造厂调查时，在该厂院内的河北省天津专区办公室的刘秘书和张同志，不但不帮助批评该厂的错误，反而出面袒护，对此亦应作深刻检讨。现此案已移送本市法院处理。

     江西水利局助理工程师王世纪不应通过私人关系活动工作编辑同志：
    我局原任助理工程师王世纪同志，于二月二十八日私自离职，工作未作任何交代。后经我们多方寻问，才知道王是通过南昌大学工学院院长兼中央重工业部顾问蔡方荫的私人关系，被介绍到中央重工业部基本建设局第一工程事务所工作。我们认为：（一）王世纪未经组织批准，通过私人关系活动工作；（二）基本建设局未经调查了解即随便任用在职干部；（三）蔡方荫从中进行私人拉拢介绍；这些都表现了无组织无纪律的行动。希望他们进行检讨，以便教育大家，杜绝这种不良风气。

            广州私立光华医学院应正确处理乱拉干部问题编辑同志：
    我们抚顺矿务局医院的医生许华生、黄鸿钧二人，于七月二十一日弃职私自逃回广州私立光华医学院任职。许、黄二人原是光华医学院的学生，经东北人民政府在关内招聘分配来我院工作。而光华医学院却一再用学校名义给许、黄二人来电报，拉他们回校工作。我们院方得知后，曾向许、黄二人说明，要调动工作必须经过组织系统。而许、黄二人不听从院方意见，竟私自弃职逃走。我希望广州市人民政府有关部门帮助光华医学院正确处理此事，纠正该院此种无组织无纪律的作风。

            西北艺术学院不应该私自拉东北博物馆的干部编辑同志：
    西北艺术学院有名叫匡扶的，不通过组织系统，一再私自写信拉我处干部阎万章同志到该校工作。去年冬季匡扶来信拉阎万章，当时经过我们说服教育，始未离职。但最近阎万章因又接到匡扶拉他去西北工作的来信而不安心工作。这种私人活动、乱拉干部的作风，如不严加纠正，将会影响我们国家的建设工作。

    铁道部新河材料厂工会主席佟湘汶录用干部违反组织原则编辑同志：
    去年八月，铁道部材料局新河材料厂工会在招考图书馆管理员时，曾有饶阳县某村小学教师王淑英，因学校放署假回天津探亲，没有经过组织批准，就私自投考而被录取。饶阳县长知道此事后，曾给材料厂工会来信，要王淑英仍回到原岗位工作。但是材料厂基层工会主席佟湘汶同志竟利用工会名义对饶阳县长的来信再三强辩，以图庇护王淑英的无组织无纪律的错误。王淑英是青年团员，原属的团支部曾催她回去办转移手续，佟湘汶同志因为怕她回去不再转来，所以就说：“咱们不要了（指团籍），不要紧。”今年五月，佟湘汶同志调到直属工会担任文教部的副部长，他又毫不顾及材料厂工会图书馆的需要，而调王淑英到直属工会工作。就我所知，佟湘汶同志之所以如此对待王淑英的任用与调动，完全是为了达到他自己的恋爱目的。我们认为佟湘汶对自己这种自私自利的非无产阶级思想，应该深刻进行检讨。
