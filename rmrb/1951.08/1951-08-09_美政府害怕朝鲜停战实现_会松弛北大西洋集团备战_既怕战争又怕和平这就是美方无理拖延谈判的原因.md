Xinhua News Agency, July 7th – The US imperialists, on the one hand, are extremely afraid that the Korean War, a "bottomless pit," will drag down their aggression plans worldwide, especially in Europe. On the other hand, they are very fearful that the realization of a Korean armistice would lead to a relaxation of the arms expansion and war preparation movement of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. This is one of the real reasons why the US government had to participate in the Korean armistice negotiations, yet has been doing its utmost to delay and sabotage the negotiations.

Since the Korean War presented the possibility of a peaceful resolution due to the efforts of the Soviet Union, Korea, and China, Agence France-Presse, in a dispatch from Washington on July 11th regarding US government and military figures discussing the "pros and cons that a ceasefire would bring to the United States," revealed: "According to estimates by certain authoritative officials in the US government," one of the "disadvantages" is: "A Korean ceasefire might relax the efforts of the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty nations to rearm. This danger of a widespread reaction to the final end of hostilities in Korea has caused anxiety among military figures in Washington." A United Press dispatch from the United Nations headquarters in New York on July 4th, citing the opinions of so-called Western diplomatic officials, also revealed the same "anxiety." These diplomatic officials "worry" that after the Korean armistice is realized, the United States and its puppet state governments "will find it difficult to" deceive the people of Europe and the United States, making them believe "there is a need for further rearmament." This will "encounter more difficulties for the Western rearmament effort." Therefore, "several well-informed diplomatic officials agree that this will make the already obvious slowdown trend in the Western world's defense (should read: aggression) efforts even slower."

In fact, as soon as the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, proposed a peaceful solution to the Korean War, the sentiment of the people in Western European countries against the arms race and war preparations was encouraged by the prospect of a possible Korean armistice and became even stronger. The strong pressure from the people even forced government officials in some countries to come forward and echo it in order to win people's hearts. According to a United Press dispatch from London on July 3rd: "The pressure to ease the expansion of armaments plans seems to be the greatest in Britain, and the separate statements made by British government ministers and Labor Party spokespersons have reflected a strong desire to restore 'peaceful industries' as soon as possible." At the beginning of July, British Defense Minister Shinwell, when mentioning the possibility of peace in Korea, hypocritically stated: "As long as there is a sign, we are eager to reduce our activities to expand our armaments." British Lord Privy Seal Stokes also said on July 2nd that Britain's armaments expansion plan "seems less urgent than it was a few days ago." Moreover, an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Paris on July 5th stated: "If the situation allows, Britain may not continue to stockpile weapons, and as long as there is the slightest sign of easing world tensions, a large part of British public opinion will demand improvements in living standards and reductions in rationing."

This expression on the British side greatly alarmed the United States. The US government immediately exerted pressure on Britain from all sides. Truman, US Supreme Court Chief Justice Vinson, and European Economic Cooperation Administration Director Katz simultaneously issued stern warnings to Britain on July 4th. Among them, Vinson most blatantly threatened: "If the Atlantic countries show any relaxation in their rearmament plans, it could cause serious consequences." British Prime Minister Attlee immediately hurriedly assured the Americans that he would never relax the arms expansion and war preparation movement. Attlee and Foreign Secretary Morrison and others subsequently delivered speeches inciting continued war preparations in an attempt to deal with what the reactionary *Daily Telegraph* called "the most erroneous view," which believes that "the prospect of a Korean ceasefire, or even the successful resolution of the entire Korean War, will naturally mean that we (referring to Britain) do not have to continue to fulfill the obligations of expanding armaments stipulated by the Atlantic Treaty."

Obviously, only assurances from the likes of Attlee and Morrison cannot reassure the US government. In mid-July, Reston, a Washington correspondent for the *New York Times*, a mouthpiece of the US State Department, said in an article that the US government officials' conclusion on the political impact of the Korean armistice negotiations was "quite pessimistic," and one of the main reasons, "perhaps the most important one," was the worry that this would "relax the movement of the United States and the Atlantic Alliance to consolidate their armaments." Stone, a commentator for another US bourgeois newspaper, *The Compass*, also recently said in an article: "The Truman administration knows that it cannot win the Korean War, and it also knows that peace in Korea will also inevitably cause it losses. This explains why the negotiations are proceeding so slowly." In fact, being both afraid of war and afraid of peace—this is the US government's true attitude towards the Kaesong negotiations, and it is the reason why the US representatives have been unreasonably delaying, sabotaging, and acting like rascals in the negotiations.

### 美政府害怕朝鲜停战实现  会松弛北大西洋集团备战  既怕战争又怕和平这就是美方无理拖延谈判的原因

　　美政府害怕朝鲜停战实现
    会松弛北大西洋集团备战
    既怕战争又怕和平这就是美方无理拖延谈判的原因
    【新华社七日讯】美帝国主义者一方面极其害怕成为“无底洞”的朝鲜战争会拖垮它在全世界，特别是在欧洲的侵略计划，另一方面却又非常恐惧朝鲜停战的实现会使北大西洋侵略集团的扩军备战运动因而松弛。这就是美国政府所以不得不参加朝鲜停战谈判，而又在谈判中竭力拖延和破坏谈判的真实原因之一。
    自从朝鲜战争由于苏联、朝鲜、中国方面的努力而出现了和平解决的可能以后，法新社就在七月十一日自华盛顿发出的一则美国政府与军界人士讨论停战将给“美国带来的利弊”的消息中透露：“据美国政府某些权威官员估计”，“坏处”之一就是：“朝鲜停战可能使美国和其他北大西洋公约国家内重整军备的努力松弛下来。这种对朝鲜敌对行为最后结束的普遍反应的危险，已引起华盛顿军界人士的焦虑。”合众社七月四日纽约联合国总部电引所谓西方外交官员的意见，也透露出同样的“焦虑”。这些外交官员“担心”：朝鲜停战实现后，美国及其仆从国家政府“将很难向”欧洲及美国人民进行欺骗，使他们相信“有进一步重整军备的需要”。这就要“使西方重整军备努力遭遇到更多的困难”。因此，“若干消息灵通的外交官员一致认为，这将使西方世界的防御（应读为侵略）努力中已经很明显的慢下来的趋势，更趋缓慢”。
    事实上，苏联驻联合国代表马立克刚一提出和平解决朝鲜战争的建议以后，西欧各国人民反对扩军备战运动的情绪，已经为朝鲜可能停战的前景所鼓舞而更加强烈了，人民的强大压力甚至使得某些国家的政府官员也不得不出面附和，以笼络人心。据合众社伦敦七月三日电透露：“要求松弛扩张军备计划的压力在英国似乎是最大，英国政府的各部长和工党发言人先后所发表的单独言论都反映出强烈的要求早日恢复‘和平工业’的愿望。”七月初，英国国防大臣辛威尔在提到朝鲜和平的可能性时假惺惺地表示：“只要有一点迹象出现，我们便亟愿减少我们扩张军备的活动。英国掌玺大臣斯托克斯七月二日也说：英国的扩张军备计划“似乎变得不像几天以前那样急需了”。并且法新社巴黎七月五日电说：“如果情况允许的话，英国可能要不继续囤积武器，并且只要世界紧张局势有丝毫缓和的迹象，很大一部分英国舆论将要求改善生活水平和缩小配给制。”
    英国方面的这种表示，使得美国大为惊恐。美国政府立即自各方面对英国施加压力，杜鲁门、美国最高法院院长文生、和欧洲经合总署署长卡茨在七月四日同一天里，一致严厉警告英国。其中文生最露骨地威胁说：“如果大西洋国家在重整军备计划方面有任何放松现象，都可能引起严重的后果。”英国首相艾德礼于是马上慌忙地向美国人保证绝不松弛扩军备战运动。艾德礼和外交大臣莫里逊等人并在其后接连发表煽动继续备战的演说，企图以此来对付一种被反动的《每日电讯报》称为“最错误的见解”，这种“见解”认为：“朝鲜停火的前途，甚至整个朝鲜战争的圆满解决，将自然而然地使我们（指英国）不必继续履行大西洋公约规定给我们的扩张军备的义务。”
    显然，只有像艾德礼、莫里逊之流的“保证”，并不能使美国政府放心。在七月中旬，作为美国国务院的喉舌的《纽约时报》驻华盛顿记者莱斯顿在一篇文章中说，美国政府官员对于朝鲜停战谈判的政治影响的结论是“颇为悲观的”，其主要理由之一，“或许是最重要的一个理由，”是忧虑这要使“美国和大西洋联盟整顿军备的运动松弛”。美国另一家资产阶级报纸《指南针日报》的评论员史东最近也在一篇文章中说：“杜鲁门政府知道，它是打不赢朝鲜战争的，同时它也知道，朝鲜和平也必定使它受到损失。这说明为什么谈判进行得很缓慢。”事实上，既害怕战争，又害怕和平——这就是美国政府对待开城谈判的真正态度，也就是美国代表为什么在谈判中无理拖延、破坏和耍无赖的原因。
