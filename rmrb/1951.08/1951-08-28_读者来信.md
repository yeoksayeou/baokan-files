Learning Mao Zedong's Mass Perspective and Mass Line

Comrade Editor:

After reading Chairman Mao's article "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," I realized that following the mass line is a crucial key to completing work tasks.

Here, I am reminded of two things I personally experienced:

In 1941, the Party organization of the troops decided to transfer a group of cadres to expand the army. I was sent to work in the guerrilla area west of the Pinghan Railway. At that time, we rigidly applied the experience of army expansion from the old liberated areas: to find "leaders" for joining the army (that is, activists who emerged from rent reduction and interest reduction and various struggles, such as militia captains, village chiefs, or branch secretaries to take the lead and call on young people to join the army together). However, we could not find any "leaders" for joining the army in the villages where we worked. In the end, we found a former soldier who had been in the old warlord army for many years and made him a village cadre. As a result, things went very badly, leaving a very bad impression on the masses, making it difficult to carry out work later. This is an example of failing to follow the mass line, resulting in the failure of the work.

In 1944, our troops returned to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region from behind enemy lines. Responding to Chairman Mao's call, we relied on our own efforts to achieve self-sufficiency, with each person reclaiming twenty mu of wasteland. This was an important political task for the troops at that time. At that time, I was doing political work in the leading organ of a regiment and attached great importance to this task. I had made several mobilizations inside and outside the Party and made specific organizational work. However, after the troops went up the mountain for a few days, the emotions of some comrades fluctuated, and their production results were not as good as other units. We immediately convened a meeting of production team leaders to review the work and found that the reason for the above phenomenon was that the troops' lives were not good. We then decided to select two weaker laborers to help with cooking and improve the food. This is a practical example of starting from the masses' immediate interests to complete the Party's political tasks.

From the above two examples, I have deeply experienced that the working method of the mass line is an important key to completing all tasks. Every one of our Party members and every revolutionary worker should learn Chairman Mao's working method.

Revolutionary Workers Must Care About the Well-being of the Masses

Comrade Editor:

After studying Chairman Mao's "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," I deeply realized that caring about the well-being of the masses is a serious political task. Only by caring about the well-being of the masses can we mobilize the broad masses to participate in national construction.

Chairman Mao said: "We should pay close attention to the problems of the well-being of the masses, from the land and labor problems to the problems of firewood, rice, oil, and salt. ... All these problems of the well-being of the masses should be put on our agenda. ... We must make the broad masses realize that we represent their interests and that we are breathing the same air as them. We must make them understand, from these things, the higher tasks we put forward, the tasks of the revolutionary war, support the revolution, push the revolution to the whole country, accept our political call, and fight to the end for the victory of the revolution." This means that only by closely linking the well-being of the masses with political tasks can we widely mobilize the people to realize political tasks; otherwise, the revolutionary work will suffer significant losses.

However, many of us often fail to do this. For example, the People's Representative Conference is the best organizational form for uniting people from all walks of life to participate in the construction of the people's democratic political power. However, some leading cadres in some areas only simply assign tasks at the People's Representative Conference and do not care about important proposals from the masses, forming the idea of "holding meetings to ask the masses for things," which greatly reduces the enthusiasm of the people to participate in the work of the state power.

In the work of purchasing and storing cotton, leading cadres in some areas do not care about the daily needs of cotton farmers and appropriately meet their needs in life, resulting in doubts among cotton farmers and affecting the completion of the task of purchasing and storing cotton. In some areas, no attention is paid to political mobilization, resulting in the same damage to the work of purchasing and storing cotton.

These all show that it is wrong to talk emptily about politics without caring about the well-being of the masses. At the same time, it is also wrong to have a purely economic point of view without paying attention to linking political mobilization and raising the political awareness of the masses.

Every one of our revolutionary cadres should study Chairman Mao's thought of relying on the masses, caring about the masses, and linking the well-being of the masses with political tasks. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, we will surely be able to victoriously complete the construction of new democracy in China and pave a smooth road for moving towards socialism.

A Large Batch of Equipment Stored by the Xingang Engineering Bureau in Dezhou Should Not Be Left in the Open to Be Exposed to Wind and Rain

Comrade Editor:

Recently, when I went to work in Dezhou City, I saw a large amount of light rail, electrical materials, and light diesel oil stored in the courtyard of the Dezhou Branch of the North China Inland River Shipping Company and on North Factory Street. It is understood that these valuable state materials were transported there by the Xingang Engineering Bureau in December last year. At that time, they were transported by canal, with a total of thirty-nine boats, totaling about two thousand tons (three or four boats were carried away this spring, and four or five train cars were carried away by train). Since these materials were transported there, only a small portion of the small and valuable materials were stored in the warehouse. The remaining large quantities of I-beams, channel steel, angle iron, round iron, steel plates, light rails, water pipes, and diesel oil have been piled up in the open, exposed to the sun and rain. Especially this summer, there has been a lot of rain, and many materials have developed thick rust after being rained on. Some of the older materials (such as some steel bars) have been corroded even more severely, looking like they have a body full of pox marks from a distance. The above materials are all valuable assets in our national construction. I hope that the relevant departments will quickly inspect them and improve their storage.

    学习毛主席的群众观点和群众路线编辑同志：
    我读了毛主席《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》一文以后，体会到走群众路线是完成工作任务的重要关键。
    这里我想起了两件亲身体验到的事情：
    一九四一年，部队党的组织决定抽调一批干部去扩军，我被派到平汉线以西游击区去工作。当时，我们死板地搬用老解放区的扩军经验：搞参军“领袖”（即是由减租减息及各种斗争中涌现出来的积极分子，如民兵队长、村长、或支部书记等带头，号召青年一同参军）。但是在我们工作的几个村子里却找不到参军“领袖”，最后找到一个在旧军阀部队中当过多年兵的兵痞，让他当了村干部。结果弄得很不好，给群众留下了很坏的印象，使以后工作很难开展。这是一个不走群众路线而使工作遭到失败的例子。
    一九四四年，我们的部队从敌后回到陕甘宁边区，响应毛主席的号召，自己动手，丰衣足食，每人开生荒二十亩。这是当时部队的重要政治任务。我那时是在一个团的领导机关作政治工作，对这一任务是相当重视的，在党内外曾作了多次的动员，并作了具体的组织工作。但当部队上了山几天之后，某些同志的情绪起了波动，生产成绩比不上别的单位。我们即召开生产组长会议，检查工作，发现产生上述现象的原因是部队生活不好。我们便决定抽出两个较弱的劳动力来帮厨，改善伙食。这是从群众切身利益出发，来完成党的政治任务的一个实际例子。
    从以上两个例子中，我深刻地体验到群众路线的工作方法，是完成一切任务的重要关键。我们每一个党员、每一个革命工作人员都应该学习毛主席的这种工作方法。

  革命工作者要关心群众生活编辑同志：
    学习了毛主席的《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》，我深深地体会到关心群众生活是一个严重的政治任务。只有关心群众生活，才有可能发动广大群众参加国家建设。
    毛主席说：“我们应该深刻地注意群众生活的问题，从土地、劳动问题，到柴米油盐问题。……一切这些群众生活上的问题，都应该把它提到自己的议事日程上。……要使广大群众认识我们是代表他们的利益的，是和他们呼吸相通的。要使他们从这些事情出发，了解我们提出来的更高的任务，革命战争的任务，拥护革命，把革命推到全国去，接受我们的政治号召，为革命的胜利斗争到底。”这就是说，只有把群众生活与政治任务紧密地联系起来，才能够广泛地动员人民实现政治任务；否则，必将使革命工作，受到重大的损失。
    但是，我们很多人，却往往不能这样地来做。例如，人民代表会议是团结各界人民参加人民民主政权建设的最好组织形式。但尚有不少地区的领导干部，在人民代表会议上，却只单纯地布置任务，不关心来自人民群众的重要提案，形成“开会就是向群众要东西”，结果就大大地降低了人民参加国家政权工作的积极性。
    在购棉储棉的工作中，某些地区的领导干部不关心棉农日常生活中的要求，适当地满足他们生活上的需要，结果使棉农发生疑虑，影响了购棉储棉任务的完成。也有些地区，不注意政治动员，结果使购棉储棉工作遭到同样的损害。
    这些，都说明着：空谈政治，不关心群众的生活问题，是错误的。同时，单纯经济观点，不注意联系政治动员，提高群众的政治觉悟，也是错误的。
    我们每一个革命干部，都应当学习毛主席依靠群众、关心群众、把群众生活与政治任务联系起来的思想。在伟大的毛泽东思想的指导下，我们一定能胜利地在全中国完成新民主主义的建设事业，为走向社会主义开辟顺利的道路。

  新港工程局存放德州的大批器材不应放置露天任其风吹雨淋编辑同志：
    近日我到德州市工作时，见德州西河场华北内河船运公司德州分公司的院内和北厂街，存有大宗的轻轨、电器材料和轻柴油等。据了解，这些宝贵的国家资材，系于去年十二月间新港工程局运到该处的，当时由运河船运，共载了三十九船，约计共二千余吨（今春相继载走三、四船，用火车载走四、五车皮）。这些物资自运到后，只有一小部分小型的贵重物资储于仓库内，其余大批的工字铁、槽铁、三角铁、圆铁、钢板、轻轨、水管子以及柴油等，一直是在露天的地方堆着，任凭日曝雨淋。特别是今年夏季多雨，很多材料经过雨淋之后，生了很厚的铁锈。有的较旧的材料（如有的钢筋），腐锈得更厉害，远远望去似生了一身瘢疹。以上物资，都是我们国家建设中的宝贵财产，希望有关部门，迅速加以检查，并改进保管。
