The Workers' Cooperative of the China Construction Enterprise Company
Should Not Neglect Cadre Political Study

To the Editor:

Our Workers' Cooperative of the China Construction Enterprise Company has a serious tendency to disregard politics.

Our cooperative has been established for more than a year and currently has nineteen cadres (including temporary workers). Cadre study has not been carried out due to the reason given by the leading comrades that "cadres do not live in concentrated areas (some in Nanchizi, some in Taipusi Street)," saying it is impossible to conduct study. Therefore, some cadres have a poor understanding of important current political movements, such as the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, and the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement. The leadership believes that developing members and doing a good job in business are all that matters, and pays no attention to the chaotic thoughts of the cadres. Recently, five comrades spontaneously organized themselves to study the Constitution of the Communist Party of China. When Comrade Wang Chunhe, the director of the cooperative, found out, he said, "Only Party members can study." Many of our comrades have the desire to study politics. I am currently using books such as "Elementary Learning Edition" as materials for study. I believe that to do a good job in business, we must pay attention to political study. It is wrong for the leading comrades of our cooperative to neglect cadre political study, and I hope they will correct this bad tendency.

   中国建筑企业公司职工合作社
   不应忽视干部政治学习编辑同志：
    我们中国建筑企业公司职工合作社，有着严重的不问政治的倾向。
    我们合作社成立已经一年多了，现有干部十九人（临时工在内）。干部学习一直没有搞起来，领导同志以“干部住得不集中（一部分在南池子，一部分在太仆寺街）”为理由，说是无法进行学习。因此，现在有一部分干部对目前重要政治运动，如抗美援朝运动、镇压反革命运动等，认识都很差。领导上却认为发展社员、搞好业务就万事大吉；对干部混乱思想不加注意。近日有五个同志自动组织起来，学习中国共产党党章。合作社主任王春和同志知道了，反而说：“必须党员才能学习。”我们很多同志都有学习政治的要求。我现在正用《学习初级版》等书作材料进行学习。我认为：我们要搞好业务必须注重学习政治。我社领导同志忽视干部政治学习是不对的，希望他们纠正这种不良倾向。
