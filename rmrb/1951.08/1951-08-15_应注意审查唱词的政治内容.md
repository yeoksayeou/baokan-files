    The Political Content of Lyrics Should Be Carefully Reviewed
    To the Editors:
    I saw a lyric seller at the Suzhou Railway Station in northern Anhui and found that many of the lyrics had political errors. One lyric, "Soong Mei-ling's Lament" (Cursing the Five Watches Tune), had the words "Approved by the Anhui Northern Anhui Literature and Art Editorial Office." The first verse is: "At the first watch, the moonlight shines through the window, Soong Mei-ling sheds tears in Taiwan, calling out to her husband, Chiang Kai-shek, that after Japan surrendered, we shouldn't have fought the civil war, why oppose peace? We made enemies of the people, drafted soldiers everywhere, imposed heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies, and the corrupt officials scraped the land clean, causing the people to suffer." Then the second verse is: "...Soong Mei-ling sheds tears in Taiwan, calling out to her husband, Chiang Chung-cheng, that he shouldn't be president, colluding with Truman, dreaming of selling out China..." Here, let's put aside the incoherence in the writing and the use of clichés, and only examine it from a political standpoint. Soong Mei-ling is a deadly enemy of the Chinese people and a top war criminal, which is common knowledge. But in the lyrics, Soong Mei-ling is written as if she is better than Chiang Kai-shek, as if she has realized that "we shouldn't have fought the civil war," shouldn't have "opposed peace," shouldn't have "made enemies of the people," shouldn't have "caused the people to suffer," and that Chiang Kai-shek "shouldn't be president"... Is this a fact? Soong Mei-ling participated in instigating the civil war from beginning to end, opposed peace, was an enemy of the people, and relied on American imperialism. The above lyrics have serious political errors, and the "Anhui Northern Anhui Literature and Art" Editorial Office was able to approve such lyrics, which is an extremely irresponsible attitude towards readers.
    Another song, "Resist America, Aid Korea Song" (Meng Jiangnu Tune), has the words "Approved for printing and sale by the Hefei Municipal People's Cultural Center." The seventh verse says: "In the seventh month, water caltrops emerge from the water with fragrance, Americans are wolves with wild ambitions, let's all go forward and beat them to death..." What we want to defeat are the warmongers of American imperialism, and we should distinguish them from the American people. This generalized term "Americans," and the phrase "let's all go forward and beat them to death" are wrong. The author himself should be responsible for this serious mistake, and the reviewers cannot shirk their responsibility either. I hope this can attract attention.
                                     Suzhou Railway Station, Northern Anhui, Qu Guangzhi
                                                          
    Editor's Note: Reader Qu Guangzhi's opinion is correct. Timely pointing out political errors in literary and artistic works is not only the responsibility of propaganda departments and cultural and educational leading organs, but also the responsibility of every reader. Lyric writers, especially the "Anhui Northern Anhui Literature and Art" Editorial Office and the Hefei Municipal People's Cultural Center, should attach importance to readers' opinions and conduct self-criticism and correction.

### 应注意审查唱词的政治内容

专栏：读者来信

    应注意审查唱词的政治内容编辑同志：
    我在皖北宿县车站看到一个卖唱词的，发现许多唱词有政治性的错误。有一张唱词《宋美龄自叹》（骂五更调），上有“皖北文艺编辑室核准”等字样。第一段是：“一吆一更里月亮照窗前，宋美龄在台湾泪涟涟，叫声丈夫介石男，日本投降后，不该打内战，反对和平为那般，苦与人民结仇冤，处处抓壮丁，苛税和杂捐，刮尽地皮污吏贪官，害的人民不得安。”接着第二段又是：“……宋美龄在台湾泪溋溋，叫声丈夫蒋中正，不该当总统，勾结杜鲁门，想出卖中国好梦未做成……”这里我们姑不论它在文字方面的不通，和使用陈词滥调等毛病，只从政治上来检查。宋美龄是中国人民的死敌，是头号战犯，这是人所共知的，而在唱词中把宋匪美龄写的好像比蒋介石好，她已认识到“不该打内战”，不该“反对和平”，不该“与人民结仇冤”，不该“害得人民不得安”，蒋介石“不该当总统”……等等，这是事实吗？宋匪美龄是自始至终都亲自参加制造内战，反对和平，与人民为敌，投靠美帝国主义的。以上唱词具有严重的政治性的错误，“皖北文艺”编辑室居然能够核准这样的唱词，这是对读者极不负责任的态度。
    另外还有一张“抗美援朝歌曲”（孟姜女调），上面写着“合肥市人民文化馆审查合格印售”字样，其中第七段：“七月里菱花出水香，美国人就是野心狼，一齐上前去打死……”，我们要打倒的是美帝国主义好战分子，应与美国人民有所区别，这样笼统地称“美国人”，和“一齐上前去打死”的说法是错误的。这种严重的错误，作者本人固应负责，审查者也不能推卸掉责任，希望能够引起注意。
                                     皖北宿县车站  曲光治                                                          
    编者按：读者曲光治的意见是正确的。及时地指出文艺作品的政治性错误不仅是宣传部门和文化教育领导机关的责任，也是每一个读者的责任。唱词编者，特别是“皖北文艺”编辑室、合肥市人民文化馆应重视读者的意见，并进行检讨和改正。
