    Heroes Battling Ice Floes
    ——The Story of an Engineering Squad of a Volunteer Army Unit Protecting a Bridge
          By Hou Yimin and Hong Bo
    (7) Then Wang Shirong led six more comrades in a small boat to continue fighting the ice. At this time, the river ice swelled even larger, and the ice floes came with even greater ferocity. Wang Shirong called on everyone: "Comrades, victory awaits us, the time to perform meritorious service has arrived!"
    (8) While Wang Shirong and three soldiers were fighting the ice floes, suddenly a piece of ice hit the small boat, breaking the boat into two pieces. All three of them fell into the river.
    (9) When they climbed onto the ice floe, they were frozen stiff. But no one complained, and their eyes shone with an unyielding light as they looked at the river bridge.

    （九）当他们爬上冰块时，已遍身冻僵。但是谁也没有叫苦，他们的眼中射出不屈的光芒，望着江桥。
