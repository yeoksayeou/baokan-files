　　Intolerable Shoddy Workmanship
        Zou Ke
    Recently, we have read many new books published by the New Tide Bookstore and found that none of them are not shoddily made. This proves that the speculative practices of the store criticized in the article "Critique of Speculative Publications by Speculative Publishers" published in the People's Daily on August 16 are indeed very serious. Taking the "Quotations from Lenin" (compiled by Qian Shifu) published by the store as an example, this book is simply a random excerpt of individual words and phrases from Lenin, with extremely mismatched chapter titles. The author even says in the preface that "the most scientific method is none other than the most mechanical method, which can also be said to be the most rigid method," and claims that his way of compiling books is: "The ancients have long been doing it, and modern people attach even more importance to it." It is infuriating to read. Another example is the book "A Course in New Finance" (written by Su Jicang), which, although wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, contains many errors of principle. For example, it says that the new democratic economic form is a unique social economic form other than the five social economic forms, and that capitalists' possession of private capital is also a manifestation of the combination of producers and the means of production.
    The translated works published by the store are also extremely capable of theft. For example, the store's publications "Stalin on Dialectics as a Method of Revolutionary Action" (translated by Zhang Xin), "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) is the Leading and Determining Force of Soviet Society" (translated by Hu Sha) and "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) is Marxism-Leninism in Action" (translated by Hu Sha), the first book is completely copied from the Pan Lang translation published by the Zhonghua Book Company. The second book is copied from the first collection of "Learning Translations" published by the "Learning" magazine, "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) is Marxism-Leninism in Action" (by Pospelov), and the third book is copied from the Soviet Political School textbook No. 9 published by the People's Publishing House, "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the Leading and Guiding Force of Soviet Society." The latter two books also deliberately changed the title, putting the content of the first book in the second book, making the content inconsistent with the title. What is even more abominable is that the "translator," probably to make it difficult for others to detect, does not hesitate to delete or arbitrarily change the content of the original work paragraph by paragraph. We really cannot tolerate this kind of practice!
    It is said that the store's speculative books are actually very popular. For example, the book "The People's Charter" published by the store (which is also a mess of copied and cut-and-paste material), sold 70,000 copies in less than a year and was reprinted eight times. These publishers and "authors" are really letting the people down. Therefore, I fully agree with the criticism in the People's Daily, and the relevant authorities should intervene in these speculative publishers!

　　不能容忍的粗制滥造现象
        邹可
    最近我们读了新潮书店出版的许多新书，发现没有一本不是粗制滥造的。这证明人民日报八月十六日所载《评投机出版商的投机出版物》一文所批评的该店的投机作风，的确是非常严重的。以该店所出版的《列宁语录》（钱实甫编）为例，这本书就是随意抄摘列宁的个别词句，加上极不相称的章节标题。作者在序文中还要说“最科学的方法不外是最机械的方法，也可以说是最呆板的办法”，并自称他这种编书的方式：“古人早已在作，近人更其重视”。读之令人愤慨。又如《新财政学教程》一书（粟寄沧著），虽然披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，但其中内容有许多原则性的错误。如说新民主主义的经济形态，是五种社会经济形态以外的独特的社会经济形态，并谓资本家占有私人资本，也是生产者与生产资料相结合的表现。
    该店出版的翻译作品，也极尽偷窃的能事。如该店出版的《斯大林论辩证法为革命行动的方法》（张新译），《联共（布）党是苏维埃社会的领导和确定方向的力量》（胡沙译）及《联共（布）党史是行动中的马列主义》（胡沙译）三书，其中第一本书是完全从中华书局出版的潘朗译本抄来的。第二本是抄自《学习》杂志出版的《学习译丛》第一辑《联共（布）党史是行动中的马列主义》（波斯别洛夫作），第三本是抄自人民出版社出版的苏联政治学校教材之九《苏联共产党是苏维埃社会的领导与指导力量。》后两本书还故意换了个书名，把第一本书的内容，装在第二本里面，使内容与书名不一致。更可恶的是“译者”大概是为了使别人不易发觉起见吧，竟不惜把原作的内容一段一段的删去或随便更改。这样作法我们实在不能容忍！
    据说该店的投机书籍，居然很有销路。例如该店出版的《人民大宪章》一书（也是乱抄乱剪的东西），不到一年，便销行七万册，再版八次。这种出版商和“编著人”，实在是太对不起人民了。因此，我完全同意人民日报的批评，对这类投机出版商，有关机关应当加以干涉！
