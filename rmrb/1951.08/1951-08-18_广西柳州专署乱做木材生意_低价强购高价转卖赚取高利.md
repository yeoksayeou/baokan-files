    The Liuzhou Prefectural Office in Guangxi Engages in Timber Business, Forcibly Purchases at Low Prices and Resells at High Prices for Profit

    Editor:
    We are two forestry work cadres, and we want to tell you about two things we know, hoping to publish them in the newspaper to attract everyone's attention.

    The Liuzhou Prefectural Office in Guangxi Province illegally organized a timber procurement office, which is forcibly purchasing timber in Chang'an Town on the Rong River. The local price for each piece of timber (chest height, 7-inch diameter) was originally 60,000 yuan, but the timber procurement office suppressed the price to 40,000 yuan, forcibly purchasing timber passing through, and then transferred it to the Wuzhou Prefectural Office, with a transfer price of 72,000 yuan per piece, earning 32,000 yuan per piece in one transaction. After their handling, with a freight cost of about 10,000 yuan per piece to Liuzhou, it can be sold for 120,000 yuan to 180,000 yuan, earning 80,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan per piece. In addition, when a farmer transported a small amount of timber, the Liuzhou Prefectural Timber Procurement Office immediately detained it, wanting to forcibly buy it at a low price of 40,000 yuan per piece. The farmer disagreed, so they refused to release it, which angered the farmer so much that he left without even taking the 40,000 yuan per piece. This kind of thing has caused great dissatisfaction among local farmers. Furthermore, the Yishan Prefectural Office also transported a batch of timber, which was frozen by the Liuzhou Prefectural Office in Rong County. Because the Rong River channel is curved, the timber transported by the Liuzhou Prefectural Office was once detained by the Yishan Prefectural Office when it passed through the Yishan Prefectural area. This time it was Liuzhou detaining Yishan's. They detained each other and retaliated against each other, thus causing disputes between the two sides, and even exchanged gunfire. It is illegal for local governments to engage in timber business in this way and forcibly purchase timber at low prices. We hope that you can suggest that the Guangxi Provincial People's Government immediately conduct an inspection and handle the matter.

### 广西柳州专署乱做木材生意  低价强购高价转卖赚取高利

    广西柳州专署乱做木材生意  低价强购高价转卖赚取高利编辑同志：
    我们是两个林业工作干部，我们要把我们所知道的两件事情告诉你们，希望登在报上，引起大家注意。
    广西省柳州专署违法组织采木办事处，在融江的长安镇进行强迫收购。本来当地每根木材（胸高、径七寸）价格六万元，但被采木办事处压低成四万元，强行收购过境的木材，然后转拨给梧州专署，转拨价是每根木材价格七万二千元，一转手每根就赚了三万二千元。再经他们手以每根一万元左右的运费运到柳州，就可以卖到十二万元、到十八万元，即每根赚八万元至十二万元。此外还有一个农民运来一点木材，柳州专署采木办事处即给扣住，要以每根四万元低价强行收买。该农民不同意卖，他们就不予放行，结果把那位农民气得连每根四万元的价款都不要就走了。这一类的事，引起当地农民很大不满。另外，宜山专署也运了一批木材，在融县被柳州专署冻结。因为融江河道弯曲，柳州专署运的木材，经过宜山专署地区时，曾经被宜山专署扣留过。这回是柳州扣留宜山的。他们之间互相扣留，互相报复，因此，双方发生争执，并曾开枪互击。地方政府这样乱做木材生意，并且压低价格强迫收购，这都是不合法的行为。希望你们能建议广西省人民政府马上进行检查处理。
