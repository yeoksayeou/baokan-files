Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: India's decision to refuse participation in the San Francisco conference has caused serious anxiety in the ruling circles of the United States, Britain, and Japan.

According to a dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Washington, August 26th, India's refusal to participate in the conference has caused "official figures in Washington to feel anxious and disappointed." Washington's "diplomatic circles" worriedly acknowledge: "As long as China and India do not participate, the treaty signed in San Francisco can only be a treaty of reconciliation between Japan and Western countries, not a treaty of reconciliation between Japan and Asian countries. Therefore, the entire issue of relations between Japan and other Asian countries remains unresolved."

According to Reuters, a British Foreign Office spokesman said on August 25th that India's refusal to participate in the San Francisco conference "greatly disappointed Britain." London believes that India's decision "has very serious implications." "This decision means that two major countries on the Asian continent, China and India, will not participate in the signing of the draft treaty distributed earlier this month." London "observers" believe: "India's decision is a major blow to the San Francisco conference." The Times said in an editorial on August 27th: "Because China is excluded and India refuses to participate, a big loophole has occurred in the peace treaty with Japan." The newspaper is concerned that the result of the San Francisco conference will only be "a limited reconciliation between Japan and Western countries and other governments willing to follow them."

In Japan, according to Agence France-Presse, Japanese "government officials" declared on August 26th: "If India and Burma do not participate in the San Francisco peace treaty conference, it will greatly diminish the importance of the treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: Washington news: The US government announced on the 26th its note to the Indian government, which is the US reply to India's note of the 23rd refusing to participate in the San Francisco conference. In this note, the US government deliberately distorts the facts and engages in sophistry regarding India's suggestions on the peace treaty with Japan.

The US note acknowledges that the US draft peace treaty with Japan is "a treaty that may have shortcomings for every country." Nevertheless, the US government is "regretful" that the Indian government believes this draft treaty "has many shortcomings," showing its complete disregard for India's suggestions.

The note pretends to be surprised by the Indian government's statement that the US draft treaty will not "give Japan a glorious, equal, and satisfactory position in the family of free nations," saying that the Indian government's "statement greatly surprised the US government." The note then shamelessly cites the letter from Dulles to Shigeru Yoshida, the US lackey and Japanese Prime Minister, on July 13th, in an attempt to prove "the belief of the US government," which is also "the belief of the Japanese government and the people of many other countries." Therefore, the note expresses dissatisfaction with the Indian government's opinion, saying: "The US government doubts whether the Indian government fully understands the opinions of the Japanese government and people and whether it has taken their opinions into consideration." Everyone knows that in Japan, apart from the isolated Yoshida reactionary group, people from all walks of life oppose the US draft treaty.

Regarding the Indian government's suggestions on territorial issues, such as returning Taiwan to China in accordance with international agreements, the United States expressed its opposition and insisted on its barbaric act of infringing upon the territorial sovereignty of other countries. Regarding China's Taiwan, the US note arbitrarily stated: "The Indian government must fully understand that it is currently impossible for the Allies to reach a final agreement on the future of Taiwan." This is just another indication of the US government's ambition to betray international credibility and attempt to occupy our territory of Taiwan for a long time. The note also obliterates the Yalta Agreement's provisions regarding the transfer of the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union and attacks India's suggestions regarding the Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands as "greatly violating the surrender conditions of the Potsdam Proclamation." In fact, the Potsdam Proclamation did not stipulate that these islands must be separated from Japanese sovereignty, but the US draft peace treaty with Japan arbitrarily stipulated that the United States should "trusteeship" them.

The United States continues to disregard India's opposition to the US-Japan military agreement, which stipulates that the United States will continue to station troops in Japan after the peace treaty. The US note uses Japanese public opinion as a pretext to argue that this agreement "will in fact conform to the will of the Japanese people. If the Japanese people do not need it, it will be difficult and completely unwelcome for the United States to assist in defending Japan."

The statement finally "expresses regret" over the Indian government's decision not to participate in the San Francisco conference.

### 印度不参加旧金山会议  美英日统治者极为忧虑  美答复印度的照会故意强词辩解

　　印度不参加旧金山会议
    美英日统治者极为忧虑
    美答复印度的照会故意强词辩解
    【新华社二十八日讯】印度决定拒绝参加旧金山会议，在美英两国以及日本的统治集团中，引起了严重的忧虑。
    据法新社华盛顿二十六日电透露，印度的拒绝参加会议，使华盛顿“官方人士不得不感到焦虑和失望”。华盛顿的“外交界人士”忧虑地承认：“只要中国与印度一天不参预其事，那么在旧金山签订的和约就只能是日本和西方国家重归于好的条约，而不是日本与亚洲国家和好的条约。因此，日本和亚洲其他国家的关系的整个问题还是悬而未决的。”
    据路透社消息，英国外交部发言人二十五日说：印度拒绝参加旧金山会议一事，“使英国大大失望”。伦敦方面认为：印度的决定“含意是非常严重的”。“这一决定意味着，亚洲大陆上的两个大国，中国和印度，都不参与在本月初散发的和约草案的签订。”伦敦的“观察家”认为：“印度的决定对旧金山会议是一个重大打击。”泰晤士报在二十七日的社论中说：“由于中国被排斥，而印度又拒绝参加，对日媾和的事便发生了很大的漏洞。”该报顾虑旧金山会议的结果将只是“日本与西方国家及其他愿追随其后的政府间的有限的媾和”。
    在日本，据法新社讯，日本“政府人士”二十六日宣称：“如果印度和缅甸不参加旧金山对日和约会议，那就会大大地减损和约的重要性”。
    【新华社二十八日讯】华盛顿消息：美国政府在二十六日公布它给印度政府的照会，这个照会是美国答复二十三日印度拒绝参加旧金山会议的照会的。美国政府在这个照会中，对印度关于对日和约的建议故意颠倒黑白强词辩解。
    美国照会承认：美国对日和约草案是“对每一个国家说来都可能存在着缺点的和约”。虽然如此，美国政府竟对印度政府认为这一和约草案“有许多缺点”，“感到遗憾”，表示出它完全无视印度的建议。
    照会对印度政府指出美国和约草案不会“给日本以在自由国家大家庭中的光荣、平等与满意的地位”，故作惊讶地说：印度政府“这种表示使美国政府大吃一惊”。照会随即无耻地举出美国走狗、日本首相吉田茂于七月十三日给杜勒斯的信为例，企图证明“美国政府的信念”，也就是“日本和许多其他国家的政府与人民的信念”。于是，照会对印度政府的意见表示不满说：“美国政府怀疑：印度政府是否已完全了解日本政府与人民的意见，是否把它们的意见考虑在内。”大家知道，在日本，除了一孤立的吉田反动集团以外，广大阶层的人民都反对美国的和约草案。
    对于印度政府所提的根据国际协议将台湾归还中国等项关于领土问题的建议，美国表示反对的态度，并坚持侵犯其他国家领土主权的蛮横行为。对于中国的台湾，美国照会武断地说：“印度政府必须充分了解：目前盟国之间是不可能在台湾前途上获得最后的协议的。”这只是再一次表明美国政府背弃国际信义而企图长期侵占我国领土台湾的野心。照会也抹煞了雅尔塔协定关于千岛群岛交给苏联的规定，并且攻击印度对于琉球与小笠原群岛的建议“大大违反波茨坦公告的投降条件”。事实上波茨坦公告并未规定这些岛屿必须脱离日本主权，而美国对日和约草案中却擅自规定要由美国加以“托管”。
    美国继续无视印度反对在媾和后规定美国继续驻军日本的美日军事协定的建议。美国的照会假借日本的民意辩解说：这个协定“将在事实上符合日本人民的意志。如果日本人民不需要的话，美国协助保卫日本将是很难实行的和完全不受欢迎的事。”
    声明最后对于印度政府决定不参加旧金山会议一事，“表示遗憾”。
