　　Protecting Forests, Saving Timber
    Northern Sichuan's Langzhong Promotes Coal Burning
    To effectively protect forests and save timber, the Langzhong County People's Government in northern Sichuan is promoting the use of coal instead of firewood to solve the fuel problem.

    Langzhong has a population of 470,000, and a large amount of firewood is needed for fuel every day. Many trees on the mountains have been cut down. This has a great impact on soil and water conservation and agricultural production. The drought in Langzhong this year is partly due to the scarcity of trees. Furthermore, at a time when timber is relatively scarce in our country and the state's basic construction requires timber, using useful timber as fuel is a serious waste. Langzhong County has sufficient conditions to switch from burning firewood to burning coal. Langzhong is located on the banks of the Jialing River, and the coal mines in Guangyuan and Wangcang counties are all upstream of the Jialing River, making coal transportation to Langzhong very convenient. In order to save timber, the county's People's Government convened a meeting of various organs and organizations in late June to discuss the matter. Everyone agreed that burning coal, in addition to saving timber, had several advantages: (1) It can open up coal sales and develop the coal mining industry. (2) It can change the current phenomenon of ships at Langzhong Wharf having no cargo to transport, and the transportation industry will thus be developed. (3) It can save expenses. According to the experiment of the No. 4 Factory of Sichuan Silk Company, one jin of coal burns longer than two jin of firewood. Currently, the price of 100 jin of coal is 11,500 yuan, while 100 jin of firewood costs 8,000 yuan. The meeting unanimously agreed to change from burning firewood to burning coal, and decided to implement it first in urban organs and organizations, and then gradually推广it to rural areas. Currently, county government organs and the CCP County Committee, etc., have begun to implement it. The county's state-owned trading company has ordered 140 tons of coal from Guangyuan and Wangcang coal mines, and will conduct planned transportation and sales according to needs in the future. The company is also preparing bellows and grate bars in a unified manner so that users can change their firewood stoves to coal stoves.

　　保护森林·节省木材
    川北阆中提倡烧煤
    川北阆中县人民政府为了有效地保护森林和节省木材，提倡用煤代替木柴解决燃料问题。
    阆中有四十七万人口，每天需要大批木柴作燃料，不少山上的树木都被砍伐尽了。这对水土保持和农业生产影响很大，今年阆中天旱，树木稀少亦是原因之一。并且，在我国目前木材比较缺乏和国家基本建设需用木材的时候，如把有用的木材作为燃料，便成为一种严重的浪费。把烧木柴改为烧煤，阆中县是有着足够的条件的。阆中位居嘉陵江畔，广元、旺苍二县的煤矿都在嘉陵江上游，煤运阆中非常方便。为着节约木材，该县人民政府特于六月下旬召集各机关团体讨论此事，大家一致认为烧煤除了能够节省木材外，还有几个好处：（一）可以打开煤炭销路，发展煤矿工业。（二）可以改变目前阆中码头船只无货可运的现象，运输事业由此得到发展。（三）可以节省开支。据四川丝业公司第四厂试验，一斤煤燃烧时间相当于二斤多木柴，目前每百斤煤价一万一千五百元，而每百斤柴需八千元。会议一致同意改烧柴为烧煤，并决定先由城市机关团体实行，而后逐渐推广至农村。现县政府各机关、中共县委等都已开始实行。该县国营贸易公司并已向广元、旺苍煤矿订购一百四十吨煤，今后将根据需要，进行有计划的运销。该公司并正在统一制备风箱、炉条等，以便用户将柴灶改为煤灶。
