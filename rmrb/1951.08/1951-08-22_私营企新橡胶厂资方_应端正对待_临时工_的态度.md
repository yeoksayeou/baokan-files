To the Editor:

The manager of the private Qixin Rubber Factory in the Seventh District of Beijing, Dong Zizhang, completely violates the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit in his attitude towards the factory's "temporary workers."

Since the liberation of Beijing, the factory's production has grown, machinery has been added, and temporary workers have been hired since October 1949. From September 1950 onwards, the factory employed a minimum of 33 and a maximum of 65 workers per month under the name of "temporary workers" (the factory only has 21 permanent workers, 10 staff members, and 4 cooks and watchmen, etc.).

Many of the factory's "temporary workers" have worked for more than six months, some for over a year continuously. "Temporary workers" work one hour more per day than permanent workers; however, among the current 47 "temporary workers," 30 earn less than the lowest wage of permanent workers, and 9 earn the same as the lowest wage of permanent workers. "Temporary workers" receive no pay for sick leave, and the capitalists do not even care about injuries sustained on the job. To our knowledge, four of the factory's "temporary workers," Ma Guoguang, Li Jinghe, Su Guihang, and Qi Hui, have been injured at work and had to return home to recuperate; Li Jinghe was immediately fired as a result.

The factory's capitalists' political attitude towards "temporary workers" has always been incorrect. In April last year, the district trade union office explained to the factory's workers that temporary workers could join the union after a certain period of employment (stated at the time as three months). When the factory's capitalists heard about this, they immediately stopped the night shift and fired all the temporary workers. In September last year, worker Qi Cheng was fired by the capitalists on the pretext that he had spoken a few words to a trade union cadre who came to the factory to understand the union's situation during working hours.

On May 2nd this year, the factory fired 13 "temporary workers," including Su Guihang, who had been working continuously in the factory for more than a year. On May 30th, the factory fired another 24 "temporary workers" (the capitalists later recalled 6 of them), of whom 13 had been working for more than six months. These dismissed workers protested to the capitalists with reason, but to no avail. The workers have now reported their dismissal and requests for reinstatement to the Labor Bureau and are awaiting mediation.

According to the production situation of Qixin Rubber Factory, they need to increase the number of permanent workers; according to the length of service of the "temporary workers," many of them should be converted to permanent workers. But why do the factory's capitalists still treat these workers as general temporary workers and dismiss them at will? In my opinion, this is because the factory's capitalists want to depress workers' wages. The Qixin Rubber Factory capitalists' practice of violating the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit is wrong and should be reviewed and corrected immediately.

### 私营企新橡胶厂资方  应端正对待“临时工”的态度

　　私营企新橡胶厂资方
    应端正对待“临时工”的态度
    编辑同志：
    北京市第七区企新橡胶厂经理董子璋，在对待该厂“临时工”的问题上，完全违反了劳资两利的政策。
    北京解放后，该厂生产日益发展，添置了机器，并从一九四九年十月起开始增雇临时工人。一九五○年九月份起，该厂每月以“临时工”名义参加生产的工人最少为三十三人，最多为六十五人（该厂只有固定工人二十一人，职员十人，厨工看门等四人）。
    该厂的“临时工”中，很多是超过半年工龄的，有的已连续工作了一年以上。“临时工”每天要比固定工多做一小时工作；但是现有的四十七名“临时工”里边，有三十人的工资低于固定工的最低工资；有九人的工资和固定工的最低工资相等。“临时工”请病假就没有工资，甚至连因公受伤，资方也不过问。就我们所知，该厂“临时工”马国光、李静和、苏桂行、齐会等四人就曾经因为工作中受了伤而回家休养过；李静和并因此而被立即解雇。
    该厂资方对待“临时工”的政治态度一贯是不正确的。去年四月间，区工会办事处在该厂工人间说明：临时工有了一定的（当时说明为三个月）工龄以后也都可以加入工会，该厂资方听到了这件事情，当时就停止了夜班，把临时工都解雇了。去年九月间，工人齐成因为在工作时间和到该厂了解工会情况的工会干部说了几句话，当晚就被资方找借口把他解雇了。
    今年五月二日该厂曾解雇“临时工”十三人，其中苏桂行已经在该厂连续工作一年以上。五月三十日该厂又解雇“临时工”二十四人（后来资方又叫回六人），其中有十三人的工龄已超过了半年。这些被解雇的工人曾据理向资方抗议，但是并没有结果。现在工人们已经把他们被解雇的经过和要求复工的意见报告了劳动局并听候调解中。
    按企新橡胶厂的生产情况说，他们是需要增加固定工的；按“临时工”的工龄说，其中很多人是应该转为固定工的。但是该厂资方为什么还把这些工人作为一般临时工，而随便加以解雇呢？照我看来，这是因为该厂资方为了压低工人工资。企新橡胶厂资方，这种违反劳资两利政策的做法是错误的，应该检讨并立即改正的。
