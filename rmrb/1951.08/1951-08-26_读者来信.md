    Condemning the US Side for Sabotaging Korean Armistice Talks
    (1) Editor Comrades:
    Upon reading the news about the repeated violations of the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement by the US-Syngman Rhee bandit troops, we felt boundless anger! This series of events demonstrates that US imperialism is planning attacks on the neutral zone and deliberately sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations. We fully support the just statement made by our delegation to the US side, reserving all rights to demand serious accountability for this incident. We also warn US imperialism: the Chinese people will never tolerate the provocative actions of US imperialism, and US imperialism must be responsible for the consequences of this matter.

    (2) Editor Comrades:
    Upon seeing the news that the US-Syngman Rhee bandit troops have repeatedly violated the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement, we felt boundless anger! These provocative incidents are clearly a planned action by US imperialism. This once again proves that the US imperialists not only lack sincerity in the Korean armistice negotiations, but also want to create various incidents to deliberately sabotage the Korean armistice conference, in order to realize their conspiracy to expand the war.
    We, the Chinese people, love peace, and we absolutely cannot tolerate the peace-disrupting actions of the US imperialists.
    All the students in our reading group feel boundless hatred and anger towards the shameless actions of the US imperialists. We are determined to strengthen our current affairs studies, do a good job in propaganda, and use practical actions to expose the conspiracies of US imperialism. People who love peace all over the world, unite and fight to the end for the sacred cause of striving for lasting world peace!

    (3) Editor Comrades:
    The US-Syngman Rhee bandit troops have repeatedly violated the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement. This barbaric and shameless behavior confirms that US imperialism has no sincerity in the Korean armistice negotiations and is carrying out sabotage activities at any time.
    The Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world must not tolerate this atrocity of US imperialism. We want to avenge Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang, who stood at the forefront of the peace camp and heroically sacrificed for the cause of world peace. We must express our angry protest with practical actions. We must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, strengthen the work of donating airplanes and cannons, promoting patriotic pacts, and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs, vigorously increase production, consolidate our national defense, and defend the fruits of victory won by the Chinese people through thirty years of hard struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party!
    Feng Lei, Cultural and Educational Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    (4) Editor Comrades:
    After reading General Nam Il's second protest letter to Joye regarding the strafing of our delegation's supply vehicles by US aircraft, the soldiers firmly support General Nam Il's just protest to the US side, and feel very indignant at the US side's violation of the agreement and its slanderous remarks. The soldiers unanimously believe that the US aircraft's unreasonable attack on our delegation's vehicles with obvious markings, and the unreasonable shooting by US armed personnel in the Panmunjom Neutral Zone, are not accidental, but a deliberate act of sabotage by the US side. These incidents prove that US imperialism lacks sincerity for peace. The soldiers unanimously expressed that they must resolutely practice their martial arts well and fight to the end for lasting world peace.

　　Factory 103 Treats Basic Construction Without Seriousness
    Calling the Addition of a Blower a Major Repair
    Many Problems Occurred in Design and Construction
    Editor Comrades:
    Due to production needs, the furnace room of Factory 103 in a certain place in eastern Sichuan must add a blower. This is a basic construction project and should be submitted to the central government for approval. The user department is eager to use it and is afraid that submitting it for approval will delay the progress of the project. The person in charge of the construction came up with a method to call the new blower a "major repair" (because major repairs are easily approved). The source of the furnace materials was added to the budgeted raw materials in February and March of this year.
    After changing the basic construction project to a major repair, the people responsible for the design and construction developed a kind of麻痹 [carelessness] thought, thinking that major repairs were not important. The designed drawings were not reviewed, discussed, or studied. When they were taken to the workshop for production, the workers were racking their brains due to the lack of detail in the design drawings, asking questions every step of the way. Ma Wenhuhu, who was in charge of the construction, changed the drawings without consulting the original designer, only based on the opinions of the workers. The original air inlet was small on the outside and large on the inside, but it was changed to large on the outside and small on the inside. Finally, after the designer's calculation, it was found that the air inlet was reversed and did not conform to the principle, so the furnace had to be chiseled open and restored.
    The furnace was completed at the end of March. When installing it, most of the parts could not be installed. For example, when installing the furnace bottom door, it was found that the furnace door could not be opened, so only a part of the ground was dug away; when installing the furnace cylinder, it was found that the furnace nozzle was crooked, which was inconvenient for discharging materials, so the original nozzle had to be sealed and another one opened; when installing the flue, it was found that the flue was crooked, and there was no way to correct it, so they had to make do with it.
    Due to the lack of coordination between design and construction, and the lack of close contact in various aspects, the budget was exceeded by more than 30 million yuan, the loss of materials accounted for about a quarter of the blower, and 80 man-days were wasted.
    On April 9, the administrative leadership convened a review meeting of the blower incident in various departments. The factory director made a summary, pointing out the lessons learned from the mistakes in this work:
    (1) The leadership's thinking is not clear and cannot grasp the central government's policy on basic construction. When dealing with work, there was no serious and responsible leadership.
    (2) Technical personnel acted independently, and those responsible for construction modified the drawings at will. This is a phenomenon of disorganization and lack of discipline.
    (3) Cadres simplistically rush for quick results in their thinking and do not consider other conditions.

　　Film Projection Teams Should Go to the Countryside More Often for Propaganda Editor Comrades:
    After reading the article "The Serious Problem is Educating Peasants" in the Party Life column of the People's Daily on August 22, I thought that film projection teams should go to the countryside more often for propaganda, because film is the most powerful tool for educating peasants.
    Some time ago, the film projection team went to Mulin Town, Shunyi District 3, to show "Children of the Storm," which was widely welcomed by the peasants. They not only thanked the People's Government for caring about their cultural life, but more importantly, they received a great education from this film. They understood how the Eighth Route Army and the people of central Hebei were united as one, and launched an indomitable and heroic struggle against the Japanese invaders. When everyone saw the Japanese invaders using machine guns to strafe the people of central Hebei, they said angrily: "Down with the Japanese devils! We must never be slaves to a foreign country again!" After watching the film, everyone discussed: "US imperialism wants to learn from the Japanese devils, use Korea as a springboard, and come to China to invade. Can we still be slaves to a foreign country? They can dream on!" Many peasants automatically made donations after returning home, and checked the implementation of their patriotic pacts. Some village cadres said: "Showing a movie once is more thorough than us talking about resisting US aggression and aiding Korea for ten days!"
    This specific fact proves that film has a great effect on the education of peasants. Film projection teams should not only go to the countryside for propaganda frequently, but also film directors and editors should create and shoot more films reflecting the life and thoughts of peasants, targeting the ideological problems that are common among peasants. The article "The Serious Problem is Educating Peasants" published in the People's Daily should attract the attention of film workers.

　　The Titles of Translated Films Should Be Improved Editor Comrades:
    In the past year, under the leadership of the Central Film Bureau, the three film studios in Northeast China, Beijing, and Shanghai have translated many Soviet films, and the achievements are great. Our audience is very grateful. But there is one thing that is not satisfactory, that is, some translators often change the original film title. Some are too far from the original meaning, and some film titles are changed to be very vulgar. Often a film has two or three titles, which makes the audience rack their brains to guess what it is. For example, "Steel Will" (also known as "The Real Man") was changed to "Flying General Without Feet". It is clear that the translator was greatly influenced by American films such as "Phantom Rider" and "Tarzan the Ape Man". Another example is "Thirteen Heroes" was changed to "Desert Hard Battle". "The Peddler and the Lady" is also called "Lovers Finally Get Married". "Model Teacher of All Ages" is also known as "Village Female Teacher", and later changed to "Peach and Plum All Over the World".
    I think the original names of Soviet films are all very good, and most of them can be translated according to the original meaning. Although, for the sake of popularization, a certain degree of retranslation can be done.

　　Newspapers Should Pay Attention to the Political Nature of Advertisements Editor Comrades:
    The advertisements published in the Yangtze River Daily and Dagan Daily on July 5 for the screening of the film "Shangrao Concentration Camp" in Wuhan's seven major cinemas actually promoted the film as a "major film exhibition for suppressing counter-revolutionaries"; Dagan Daily even erroneously promoted in its "Important Announcement of the Seven Cinemas" that "Shangrao Concentration Camp is the best film for suppressing counter-revolutionaries". What a serious political error this is! The Central South Art Theater, which published the advertisement, made a public self-criticism in the first edition of Dagan Daily on July 6 after the error occurred; while Dagan Daily only used a few perfunctory words such as "The error in the above advertising wording was published as it was without our review. We also bear a certain responsibility politically and should make a public self-criticism..." to shirk its responsibility. Of course, Dagan Daily's self-criticism is not profound, but it cannot be regarded as a major progress to be able to make a public self-criticism and admit its mistakes. However, as the newspaper of the Central South District - Yangtze River Daily, it neither published the self-criticism of the Central South Art Theater, nor made a self-criticism of its own mistakes, which is even more inappropriate. I hope that the editorial departments of Yangtze River Daily and Dagan Daily can make a profound self-criticism on the ideological style of leadership and set out specific methods to fight for strengthening the political nature of "advertisements".
      Sun Xingran, National Committee of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union
    Editor's Note: "Advertisements" are a part of the newspaper, and like other parts of the newspaper, they are responsible to the broad masses of the people and serve the people. This is one of the essential differences between people's newspapers and bourgeois newspapers. Therefore, a responsible and perfunctory attitude should not be adopted towards advertisements, and they should be "published as they are" without "reviewing them". The phenomenon of the editorial department lacking political leadership over advertisements not only exists in the above two newspapers, but also exists in the work of many other newspapers, and should be corrected.

    谴责美方破坏朝鲜停战谈判
    （一）编辑同志：
    看到报纸上关于美李匪军数次违反开城中立区协议的消息，我们感到无比的愤怒！这一连串事件，说明美帝国主义是有计划地袭击中立区，蓄意破坏朝鲜停战谈判。我们完全支持我代表团向美方提出的对此事件保留严正要求的一切权利的正义声明。并警告美帝国主义：中国人民决不能容忍美帝国主义的挑衅行为，美帝国主义应对此事的后果负责。

    （二）编辑同志：
    看到美李匪军一再破坏开城中立区协议的新闻，我们感到无比的愤怒！这些挑衅事件，很明显，是美帝国主义有计划的行动。这再一次证明了美帝国主义者不但对朝鲜停战谈判缺乏诚意，而且想制造各种事件故意破坏朝鲜停战谈判会议，以遂其扩大战争的阴谋。
    我们中国人民是爱好和平的，我们对美帝国主义者破坏和平的行动是绝不能容忍的。
    我们读报组的全体同学，对美帝国主义者这种无耻行动感到无比的仇恨和愤怒。我们决心要加强时事学习，作好宣传工作，以实际行动来揭穿美帝国主义的阴谋。全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，为争取世界持久和平的神圣事业而奋斗到底！

    （三）编辑同志：
    美李匪军再三再四地破坏开城中立区协议，这种蛮横无耻的行为，证实了美帝国主义对朝鲜停战谈判是毫无诚意，而且随时进行破坏活动。
    中朝人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，决不能容忍美帝国主义这种暴行。我们要替站在和平阵营最前线的、为全世界人民和平事业奋斗而英勇牺牲的姚庆祥排长报仇。我们要以实际行动来表示我们愤怒的抗议。我们要坚决镇压反革命分子，加强捐献飞机大炮、推行爱国公约和优待烈军属等抗美援朝工作，努力增加生产，巩固我们的国防，保卫中国人民在共产党领导下三十年来坚苦奋斗而获得的胜利果实！

    （四）编辑同志：
    读了南日将军二次给乔埃的关于美机扫射我代表团供应车辆事的抗议书后，战士们都坚决拥护南日将军对美方的正义抗议，并对美方违背协议反而发表诬蔑性的言论等行为感到非常激愤。战士们一致认为：美国飞机无理袭击我方有显著标志的代表团车辆，同时，美方武装人员又无理射击板门店中立区。这些事件决不是无意的，而是美方有意的破坏协议的行动。这几件事情证明美帝国主义是缺乏和平诚意的。战士们一致表示：要坚决练好武艺，为争取世界持久和平而奋斗到底。

　　一○三厂对待基本建设不严肃
    把添制鼓风炉说成大修理
    设计施工中发生了许多问题
    编辑同志：
    川东某地一○三厂炉子房由于生产上的需要，必须添制一部鼓风炉。这是基本建设，应该报请中央核准。使用部门急于使用，怕报请核准而延缓工程的进行。负责施工的人便想出一个方法，把新做鼓风炉的事，称之为“大修理”（因为大修理容易被批准）。炉子的材料来源，在今年二、三月份的预算原材料中加进去。
    把基本建设工程改为大修理后，负责设计和施工的人们就产生了一种麻痹思想，以为大修理是不紧要的。设计后的图样，未经人考核、讨论和研究；拿到工场去做的时候，由于设计图样的不详细，使工人大伤脑筋，做一段问一段。负责施工的马文虎不征求原设计人的同意，只根据工人的意见，就擅自把图样改了。原图的进风口本是外小内大，结果改为外大内小。最后经过设计人的计算，认为风口颠倒，不符合原理，只好把炉子凿开改造还原。
    炉子在三月底做好。在装按时有大部分机件装不起来。比如装炉底门时，发现炉门打不开，只有把地挖去一部分；装炉缸时，又发现炉嘴歪了，出料不方便，只好把原嘴封上，另开一个；装烟道时，发现烟道是歪的，又无法改正，只好将错就错。
    由于设计与施工的不能配合，以及各方面的联系不够密切，结果超出预算三千多万元，损失材料约占鼓风炉的四分之一，浪费人工八十个。
    四月九日行政领导方面召集各部门举行鼓风炉事件检讨会，由厂长作总结，指出这次工作错误的教训：
    （一）领导上思想不明确，不能掌握中央关于基本建设的政策。处理工作时，没有认真负责领导。
    （二）技术人员间各自为政，负责施工者随便修改图样，这是无组织无纪律的现象。
    （三）干部在思想上单纯地急于求成，不考虑其他条件。

　　电影放映队应该多多下乡宣传编辑同志：
    读了人民日报八月二十二日党的生活栏《严重的问题是教育农民》一文之后，我想起了电影放映队应该多多下乡宣传，因为电影是教育农民最有力的一种工具。
    前些日子，电影放映队到顺义三区木林镇放映《新儿女英雄传》，普遍受到农民的欢迎。他们不仅感谢人民政府关心他们的文化生活，更重要的是，他们从这部影片里，得到了很大的教育；认识了八路军和冀中人民如何军民一体，同日寇展开不屈的英勇斗争。当大家看到日寇用机枪扫射冀中人民的时候，都愤愤地说：“打倒日本鬼子，决不能再当亡国奴！”看完这部片子之后，大家议论纷纷：“美帝国主义想学日本鬼子，把朝鲜当跳板，要来中国侵略，咱还能当亡国奴吗？他休想！”不少农民回家后又自动捐献，并且检查自家爱国公约的执行程度。有的村干部说：“演一次电影，比咱讲十天抗美援朝还要透彻！”
    这一具体事实证明，电影对农民的教育是有很大作用的。电影放映队不仅要经常下乡宣传，同时，电影的编导工作者，也应针对农民普遍存在的思想问题，多创作和摄制反映农民生活思想的影片。人民日报所发表的《严重的问题是教育农民》一文，应该引起电影工作者的注意。

　　翻译影片的片名应该改进编辑同志：
    一年来，在中央电影局领导下的东北、北京、上海等三个电影制片厂，翻译了很多苏联影片，成绩是很大的。我们观众都是很感激的。可是有一件事不能使人满意，就是有些翻译者常常把原来的片名改换。有些距离原意太远，有些片名则改得十分庸俗。常常一部影片有了两三个片名，使观众煞费猜测，不知究竟。像《钢铁意志》（又名《真正的人》），改成了《无脚飞将军》。这分明是翻译者受了美国片《怪骑士》、《人猿泰山》等一类影片很大的影响。再像《十三勇士》改成了《沙漠苦战记》。《货郎与小姐》又叫《有情人终成眷属》。《万世师表》又名《乡村女教师》，后又改成了《桃李满天下》。
    苏联影片原来的名字，我觉得都很好，大部分都可照原意译过来。虽然为了通俗化，可以作一定程度的改译。

　　报纸应注意广告的政治性编辑同志：
    七月五日长江日报、大刚报刊载的武汉七大影院上映《上饶集中营》影片的广告，竟把该片作为“镇压反革命影展巨片”来宣传；大刚报在《七院重要启事》中，更错误地宣传了“上饶集中营是镇压反革命最佳影片”。这是多么严重的政治错误！刊登广告的中南艺术剧院，在错误发生以后即在七月六日的大刚报第一版作了公开检讨；而大刚报则仅以“上项广告词句的错误，我们竟未加审核，照稿刊登。在政治上也负有一定责任，应公开检讨。……”等几句轻描淡写的话，来卸脱了自己的责任。当然，大刚报的检讨是不深刻的，但能作公开检讨承认其错误，不能不算是一大进步。可是作为中南区的报纸——长江日报，既没刊登中南艺术剧院的检讨，又没对自己的错误进行检讨，那就更不应该了。我希望长江日报与大刚报编辑部能从领导思想作风上作深刻的检讨，并定出具体办法，为加强“广告”的政治性而斗争。
      中国教育工会全国委员会  孙星燃
    编者按：“广告”是报纸的一部分，它和报纸的其他部分同样是对广大人民负责，为人民群众服务的工具。这是人民报纸与资产阶级报纸的本质的区别之一。因此，对于广告，不应该采取不负责的草率态度，对来稿“竟未加审核”，就“照稿刊登”。编辑部对广告缺乏政治领导的现象，不只以上两报存在，在其他许多报纸工作中，也同样存在着，都应加以纠正。
