Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Just as the U.S. representatives are doing their utmost to delay and obstruct the Korean peace negotiations, the notorious U.S. warmonger, New York State Governor Dewey, under the orders of the U.S. State Department, has come to the Far East to conduct a series of conspiracy activities. The detailed schedule of his activities was "drawn up by the U.S. State Department" and approved by Truman. Facts show that Dewey's trip aims to accelerate the signing of a separate peace treaty with Japan, advocate the organization of a Pacific aggressive bloc, and plan for bloody intervention in Vietnam.

Since arriving in Japan on July 4, Dewey has conducted activities in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, the French-occupied areas of Indochina, Malaya, and Indonesia. He is now in Australia and will also go to New Zealand. Dewey held a series of secret talks in these places with some of the most reactionary rulers there and the American agents there. Dewey lobbied for a separate peace treaty with Japan in Japan, Indonesia, Australia, and other places. He instigated the Japanese reactionaries not to worry about opposition from all sides and to sign a separate peace treaty with the United States. On July 6, he said in Tokyo that he firmly believed that the Japanese reactionaries "would not fail" the expectations of the United States. Dewey also lobbied the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, and other countries to abandon their demands for reparations from Japan and their demands for restrictions on Japan's re-militarization. However, what Dewey encountered was still the extreme dissatisfaction of the people of Asian countries with the U.S.'s illegally drafted draft of the separate peace treaty with Japan. On August 5, he admitted in a speech in Darwin, Australia: "Different countries oppose different clauses in the peace treaty with Japan."

As for piecing together the Pacific aggressive bloc, Dewey publicly declared on June 23, before departing from the United States, that the United States was in the process of concluding common defense and security agreements with Japan, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand. Dewey discussed the Pacific Pact with Quirino in the Philippines. He is currently in Australia and will be conducting activities on this issue in New Zealand.

Dewey's trip is related to the U.S. imperialists' current bloody conspiracy of military aggression against the Asian people. He discussed the Korean War with Ridgway in Japan and personally inspected the front lines of the U.S. invading forces in Korea. He declared that the United States would always provide military aid to the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan, and he expressed interest in supporting the Kuomintang remnants' "offensive against the Chinese mainland." During his stay in Hong Kong, Dewey went to the Kowloon border for "inspection." The nature of Dewey's trip against our people is obvious. When he was in Malaya, he took a special plane to "inspect" the "jungle battlefield" where the British colonial army was fighting against the Malayan National Liberation Army.

Of particular note is that Dewey went to Vietnam after U.S. State Department envoy special envoy Bullitt. This shows that while the Korean armistice negotiations are underway, U.S. imperialism has stepped up its planning for bloody intervention in the Vietnamese liberation war, attempting to turn Vietnam into a new base of aggression. Dewey held secret talks with the puppet emperor Bao Dai and the puppet Prime Minister Tran Van Huu in Vietnam. According to Reuters, Dewey claimed that he was in Vietnam "studying the possibility of rapidly providing military and economic assistance to Indochina from the perspective of the Korean armistice," and he was also "studying the issue of U.S. support for France" in carrying out the war of aggression against Vietnam. It is also worth noting that Dewey went to Vietnam after meeting with Chiang Kai-shek and Chase, head of the U.S. military delegation, in Taiwan. The French government revealed that about 30,000 Kuomintang remnants had fled to Indochina. There are also some Kuomintang remnants in northern Thailand and northern Myanmar, and the United States has repeatedly sent military delegations to northern Thailand to conduct activities recently.

It is very clear that U.S. imperialism is stepping up its intervention in Vietnam and turning Vietnam into the forefront of aggression against Asia. Dewey openly clamored on August 6 when he arrived in Canberra, the capital of Australia: "Indochina is the forefront of defending (should be invading) Asia." He said that if the people of Indochina are liberated, "then Southeast Asia will be finished. I believe that defending Indochina is defending Southeast Asia, defending Indonesia, New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand." According to the French newspaper L'Humanité, the recent meeting of the defense ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and Canada in Washington, in addition to discussing the standardization of weapons for the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, also discussed their strategic issues in the Far East and the Middle East, including stepping up intervention in the Vietnam War.

　　美著名战争贩子杜威到远东进行阴谋活动
    【新华社九日讯】正当美国代表竭力拖延、阻挠朝鲜和平谈判的时候，美国著名的战争贩子、纽约州州长杜威奉美国国务院之命，来到远东各地进行一系列的阴谋活动。他活动的详细日程，是由美国“国务院拟定”并经过杜鲁门同意的。事实表明，杜威此行目的在于加速签订片面对日和约，鼓吹组织太平洋侵略集团，并策划对越南的血腥干涉。
    杜威在七月四日到日本以后，已先后在日本、南朝鲜、台湾、菲律宾、香港、印度支那法占区、马来亚、印尼进行了活动。他现在正在澳大利亚，还要去新西兰。杜威在上述这些地方与当地若干最反动的统治者及美国在那里的代理人进行了一系列的秘密会谈。杜威在日本、印尼、澳大利亚等地都为片面对日和约进行了游说。他唆使日本反动派不必顾虑各方反对，与美国签订片面对日和约。他七月六日在东京说：他深信日本反动派“不会辜负”美国的期望。杜威也游说菲律宾、印尼、澳大利亚等国放弃对日本的赔偿要求及限制日本重新军国主义化的要求。但是，杜威所遇到的仍然是亚洲各国人民对美国非法拟定的片面对日和约草案的极端不满，他八月五日在澳大利亚达尔文谈话时承认：“不同国家反对对日和约中不同条款。”
    至于拼凑太平洋侵略集团，杜威在从美国出发之前，在六月二十三日就公开声言，美国正在与日本、菲律宾、澳大利亚、新西兰缔结共同防御与安全协定的事宜。杜威在菲律宾与季里诺讨论了太平洋公约的问题。他正在澳大利亚并将在新西兰为这个问题进行活动。
    杜威此行与美帝国主义目前对亚洲人民进行军事侵略的血腥阴谋有关。他在日本与李奇微商讨了侵朝战争的问题，并亲自到朝鲜曾视察了侵朝美军的前线。他扬言美国将始终以军事援助给予台湾的国民党残匪，他对支援国民党残匪“进攻中国大陆”表示有兴趣。杜威在香港期间曾到九龙边界“视察”。杜威此行的反对我国人民的性质昭然若揭。他在马来亚时曾特别乘飞机到英国殖民军对马来亚民族解放军作战的“丛林战场”上空进行“视察”。
    尤其值得注意的，杜威是继美国国务院密使布立特之后到越南去的。这表明美帝国主义在朝鲜停战谈判进行之际，又已加紧策划对越南解放战争的血腥干涉，企图把越南变为新的侵略基地。杜威在越南与傀儡皇帝保大、伪总理陈文友举行了秘密会谈。据路透社说，杜威声称：他在越南是“从朝鲜停战方面研究迅速给印度支那军事援助和经济援助的可能性”，他也同时“研究美国支持法国”进行侵越战争的问题。同样值得注意的是：杜威是在到台湾与蒋介石及美国军事代表团团长蔡斯会谈之后前往越南的。法国政府曾透露，约有国民党残匪三万人逃亡在印度支那。在泰国北部和缅甸北部也有一部分国民党残匪，美国最近一再派遣军事代表团人员到泰国北部进行活动。
    美帝国主义加紧干涉越南并将越南变为侵略亚洲最前线的阴谋，是十分明显的。杜威八月六日在到达澳大利亚首都堪培拉时公然叫嚣说：“印度支那是保卫（应该为侵略）亚洲的最前线”。他说，如果印度支那人民获得解放，“那末东南亚便完了。我相信，保卫印度支那就是保卫东南亚、保卫印尼、新几内亚、澳大利亚和新西兰”。据法国人道报揭露，最近在华盛顿举行的美、英、法、加四国国防部长会议，除了讨论北大西洋侵略集团的武器标准化问题外，还讨论了它们在远东和中东的战略问题，包括加紧干涉越南战争问题在内。
