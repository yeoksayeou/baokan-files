　　Celebrating the Sixth Anniversary of the Liberation of Korea
    Nie Rongzhen, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission
    We warmly congratulate our neighbor, the Korean people, on the sixth anniversary of their liberation from the aggression of the Japanese bandits.
    Since ancient times, China and Korea have been brotherly countries, and our two countries' cultures have always been mutually exchanged and infiltrated. In the past century, we have grown up suffering the same imperialist aggression, and the people of the two countries have been closely linked and sharing life and death in the great struggle for independence and liberation; especially in the long and arduous struggle against the Japanese invaders, the revolutionaries of our two countries often fought side by side in the same combat unit.
    Six years ago today, with the assistance of the great allied Soviet army, our two peoples expelled Japanese imperialism. However, American imperialism, which made a fortune in the anti-fascist war, replaced German fascism in the West and inherited Japanese imperialism in the East. On the one hand, it used its running dog Chiang Kai-shek to attack the Chinese people; on the other hand, it occupied South Korea, single-handedly created the Syngman Rhee puppet government, and implemented a bloody rule against the Korean people. The conspiracy of American imperialism to enslave the Eastern people is no different from that of the Japanese bandits.
    However, due to the heroic struggle of the Eastern people, American imperialism has suffered tragic failures in both China and Korea. On the one hand, the imperialists and their loyal running dog Chiang Kai-shek were driven out of mainland China, the People's Republic of China was established, greatly strengthening the strength of the world peace and democracy camp, and also severely打击了the aggressive camp of imperialism. On the other hand, with the unified participation of the people of North and South Korea in the election, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established, and the land reform law, labor law, the nationalization law of important industries, and the law of equal rights for men and women were implemented, making the Korean people truly masters of the country for the first time. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea launched a huge economic construction work, making the industrial and agricultural production of North Korea exceed the pre-liberation level; the cultural and educational undertakings of the Korean people have also achieved great success. The liberation cause of the Eastern people is extremely hated by American imperialists and their running dogs Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, etc. They are unwilling to accept their failure, and they try to escape their crisis by launching a war of aggression. Thus, American imperialists openly sent troops to invade Korea in June last year, and while they were carrying out armed aggression against Korea, they immediately dispatched American air and naval forces to invade our country's Taiwan, and used their air force to continuously penetrate into our country's airspace,肆行strafing and bombing. These actions of the United States are not isolated and accidental events, but are implementing the "Continental Policy" that Japanese imperialism had already implemented. They are following the old path that Japanese imperialism had already taken. They are attempting to seize Korea and China's Taiwan, and use this as a base to destroy the entire China and invade the entire Asia.
    American imperialism has suffered heavy blows in the war of aggression. The heroic Korean people, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, launched a sacred and great war of resistance against aggression. For more than a year, the American invading army has suffered enormous casualties and losses. Last October, when the American invading army gathered superior forces and crossed the 38th parallel to invade northward, we Chinese people, in order to defend the security and independence of our motherland, and to defend peace in the East and the world, dispatched our volunteer forces to assist and participate in the Korean people's sacred struggle against American imperialism. The Chinese and Korean people's troops have fought side by side in five battles, achieving brilliant results, crushing the American bandits' conspiracy to destroy Korea, and thus打击了the American aggressors'狂妄attempt to burn the flames of war into Chinese territory. The heroic battles of the Chinese and Korean people prove that the just war will surely win the final victory.
    The victory of the Chinese and Korean people in jointly resisting Japanese imperialism six years ago is enough to show that any force that inherits the aggressive cause of Japanese imperialism will eventually fail. Moreover, when Japan first occupied Korea, there was no Democratic People's Republic of Korea, nor was there the People's Republic of China and other new democratic countries, nor was there the bulwark of the world peace and democracy camp, the powerful and invincible socialist country of the Soviet Union. But today, the world has the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and its strength exceeds the aggressive camp headed by American imperialism; there is the People's Republic of China, which has grown up in the long-term struggle against Japanese imperialism and American imperialism's running dog Chiang Kai-shek; and there is also the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which has undergone five years of peaceful construction and has been tested by more than a year of war against American imperialist aggression. There is no doubt that any imperialist who insists on invading Korea and China will inevitably end up with the same tragic end as Japan.
    We, the Chinese and Korean people, have experienced countless arduous and tortuous roads in the struggle against the Japanese bandits. Especially in the struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army against Japanese fascism and Chiang Kai-shek, who was fully supported by American imperialism, our strength was once in a disadvantaged position, but in the end victory belongs to the people, and in the end it belongs to our just war. Chiang Kai-shek and the American aggressors also had such an illusion in the peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, thinking that the Chinese people could be deceived and defeated. But now it proves that it is they themselves who have failed. Although the situation today has changed greatly, they should still remember this lesson.
    Now the representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are holding armistice negotiations with the representatives of the United Nations forces. We, the peace-loving Chinese and Korean people, hope that the negotiations will quickly achieve the purpose of the armistice on a fair and reasonable basis. But the realization of peace must be based on the sincerity of both sides. Any conspiracy to expand aggression by using negotiations is bound to fail.
    Glory belongs to the great Korean people!
    Glory belongs to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers!
    Long live General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live Marshal Stalin, the mentor of the people of all countries in the world!
                                  (Written for the Korean Central News Agency)

### 庆祝朝鲜解放六周年

　　庆祝朝鲜解放六周年
    中国人民革命军事委员会副总参谋长  聂荣臻
    我们热烈祝贺我们的邻邦朝鲜人民从日本强盗的侵略下获得解放的六周年纪念日。
    从久远的年代以来，中国和朝鲜就是两个兄弟国家，我们两国的文化从来都是互相交流与渗透着的。近百年来，我们更是在同受帝国主义侵略的灾难中长大起来，两国人民在争取独立解放的伟大斗争中，是休戚相关、生死与共的；尤其在反对日本侵略者的长期艰苦斗争中，我们两国的革命志士常常是在一个战斗单位里并肩作战的。
    六年前的今天，我们两国人民在伟大的盟邦苏联军队的援助下，驱逐了日本帝国主义。但是，在反法西斯战争中发了横财的美帝国主义，在西方代替了德国法西斯，在东方继承了日本帝国主义。它一方面利用了它的走狗蒋介石向中国人民进攻；另一方面占领了南朝鲜，一手制造了李承晚傀儡政府，实行反对朝鲜人民的血腥统治。美帝国主义企图奴役东方人民的阴谋是和日本强盗并无分别的。
    但是，由于东方人民的英勇斗争，美帝国主义在中国和朝鲜都遭遇到悲惨的失败。一方面帝国主义者及其忠实走狗蒋介石被逐出中国大陆，中华人民共和国成立了，大大加强了世界和平民主阵营的力量，也严重地打击了帝国主义的侵略阵营。另一方面在南北朝鲜人民一致参加选举下，成立了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，实施了土地改革法令、劳动法令、重要产业国有化法令及男女平等权法令，使朝鲜人民第一次的真正成了国家的主人。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国展开了巨大的经济建设工作，使朝鲜北部的工业农业生产量超过解放前的水平；朝鲜人民的文化教育事业也得到了巨大的成绩。东方人民的解放事业是为美帝国主义者及其走狗蒋介石、李承晚等所极度仇视的，他们不甘心自己的失败，他们力谋用发动侵略战争的方法来逃脱自己的危机。于是，美帝国主义者于去年六月公开出兵侵略朝鲜，并且在其武装侵略朝鲜的同时，立即派遣美国的空军和海军侵略我国的台湾，并使用其空军连续深入我国领空，肆行扫射与轰炸。美国这些行动并不是孤立的偶然事件，而是实行着日本帝国主义早已实行过的“大陆政策”，他们走着日本帝国主义早已走过的老路，他们是企图侵占朝鲜和中国的台湾，并以此为基地进而灭亡全中国，侵略全亚洲。
    美帝国主义在侵略战争中是受到了沉重的打击，英勇的朝鲜人民在金日成将军领导下，举行了神圣的伟大的反抗侵略的战争。一年多以来，美国侵略军遭受了绝大伤亡与消耗。去年十月，当美国侵略军纠集优势兵力越过三八线向北侵犯的时候，我们中国人民为了保卫自己祖国的安全与独立，为了保卫东方与世界的和平，派遣了自己的志愿部队来协助和参加了朝鲜人民的反对美帝国主义的神圣斗争。中朝人民的部队已经并肩地进行了五次战役，获得了辉煌的战果，粉碎了美国强盗灭亡朝鲜的阴谋，因而也打击了美国侵略者想把战火燃烧到中国境内的狂妄打算。中朝两国人民的英勇战斗证明了正义战争必将取得最后胜利。
    六年以前中朝两国人民共同反抗日本帝国主义的胜利，也足以说明任何继承日本帝国主义侵略事业的势力最后终要失败。而且当日本最初占领朝鲜的时候，当时还没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，也没有中华人民共和国和其他的新民主主义国家，更没有世界和平民主阵营的堡垒、强大无敌的社会主义国家苏联存在。而在今天，全世界有了苏联为首的和平民主阵营，它的力量超过了以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营；有了与日本帝国主义和美帝国主义走狗蒋介石长期斗争中成长起来的中华人民共和国；更有了经过五年和平建设，并经过了一年多反对美帝国主义侵略战争考验的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，毫无疑义，任何坚持侵略朝鲜和中国的帝国主义者，必然要得到和日本同样悲惨的下场。
    我们中朝人民在反抗日本强盗的斗争中，是经历过无数艰苦曲折的路程。尤其我中国人民解放军在反对日本法西斯与美帝国主义全力支持的蒋介石的斗争中，我们的力量曾经是处在劣势的地位，但最后胜利终是属于人民，终是属于我们正义的战争方面。蒋介石和美国侵略者在国共的和平谈判中，也曾有过这样的错觉，以为中国人民是可以欺骗和击败的。但现在证明了失败的正是他们自己。虽然今天的形势已经大大地改变了，而这个教训，他们还应当记取。
    现在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的代表正在和联合国军的代表举行停战谈判。我们热爱和平的中朝人民，希望谈判在公平合理的基础上迅速达到停战的目的。但和平的实现必须双方同样具有诚意。任何利用谈判扩大侵略的阴谋，是必然要失败的。
    光荣属于伟大的朝鲜人民！
    光荣属于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军！
    朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    世界各国人民的导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
