　　Local Product Visiting Groups Promote Material Exchange
    Xinhua News Agency: Northwest Region’s Local and Specialty Product Visiting Group Promotes Sales of Many Local Products to Distant Areas

　　The Shaanxi-produced pigs are transported from Yan'an to Shanghai for the first time, totaling 35,000 heads; the Hami melons and raisins from Xinjiang have been trial-sold to Nanning, Guangxi. These are the results of the Northwest Local and Specialty Product Exchange Visiting Group's efforts to promote sales. The group, composed of representatives from public and private businesses in the Northwest region, visited Shanghai and Hankou for nearly two months and returned to this location on the 19th from Hankou. The group brought 167 kinds of local and specialty product samples from the Northwest region and participated in the East China Local Product Conference, the Shanghai Local Product Exhibition and Exchange Conference, and the Central South Local and Specialty Product Exhibition and Exchange Conference. During the visit, the group signed 128 contracts and agreements with public and private enterprises in East China, Central South, and other regions, with a total value of over 67.7 billion yuan. Through these contracts and agreements, the Northwest region has established new trade relations with Jilin, Yunnan, Guangxi, Fujian, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, opening up sales channels for certain slow-moving local products in the Northwest. The water tobacco from Lanzhou, the rhubarb from Ba Mountain, and the sulfur produced in Pucheng have also found markets.

    Xinhua News Agency: Southwest Local Product Visiting Group Representatives Return to Various Places to Actively Promote Improved Local Product Management Methods

　　Representatives of the local product visiting groups from provinces and cities in the Southwest region, who participated in the local and specialty product exhibition and exchange conferences and local product conferences in East China and Central South regions, have returned to their respective places and reported their observations to local industrial and commercial circles and relevant departments.

　　The Southwest Local Product Visiting Group brought more than 4,000 kinds of local and specialty product samples from the Southwest region. At the local product exhibition and exchange conferences in East China and Central South regions, they extensively contacted public and private commercial representatives from all over the country, re-establishing many interrupted business relationships. The sales of local products were much larger than in the past when they were sold sporadically in other regions. This time, the Southwest region signed more than 36 billion yuan in local and specialty product exchange contracts and agreements with various regions outside the region, of which 49 percent were items that had rarely been traded since the Anti-Japanese War. For example, many medicinal materials from the Southwest region had not been sold to the Northeast since the "September 18th Incident." This time, contracts were signed with commercial delegations from the Northeast at the East China and Central South regions, resuming sales outside the Guan. Furthermore, Guanggan oranges from eastern Sichuan, Yunnan ham, silver fungus from northern Sichuan, Shu brocade and embroidered satin from western Sichuan have all restored old sales channels or found new markets. The sales of Yunnan ham in Shanghai have been interrupted for more than ten years, and this time, the visiting group signed a transaction agreement with Shanghai preserved meat merchants.

　　The Southwest Local Product Visiting Group conducted a detailed survey of the sales of Southwest local products in other regions in order to guide production in the future. The visiting group also carefully collected the advanced experiences of various regions in local product management as a reference for local product management in the Southwest region. Regarding the inconvenience of transportation in the Southwest region and bulky local products, the visiting group believes that a solution can be found in processing, based on the exchange of opinions with representatives from various regions. The Southwest Local Product Visiting Group personally experienced that the vast and populous motherland has a huge capacity for local products, which greatly increased their confidence in managing local products.

### 各地土产参观团推动了物资交流

　　各地土产参观团推动了物资交流
    西北区土产特产参观团把许多土产推销到远地
    陕北产的猪，第一次从延安运销上海三万五千头；新疆的哈密瓜、葡萄干，已试销到广西的南宁。这是西北土产特产交流参观团努力推销的结果。该团是由西北区公私商业代表组成，在上海、汉口两地作了近两个月的访问参观，已于十九日自汉口返抵此间。该团出发时曾携带西北区土特产样品一百六十七种，先后参加了华东区土产会议、上海市土产展览交流大会及中南区土特产展览交流大会。该团在参观期间，和华东、中南以及其他各地公私企业订立合同和达成协议共一百二十八件，总值达六百七十七亿多元。通过这些合同、协议，西北区已和吉林、云南、广西、福建、上海、广州等地建立了新的贸易关系，为西北某些滞销土产打开了销路。兰州的水烟、巴山的大黄、蒲城产的硫磺也都找到了销路。

    西南土产参观团代表返各地积极宣传改进土产经营方法
    西南区各省、市派往华东、中南两区参加土、特产展览交流会与土产会议的土产参观团代表，已分别返回原地，并向各地工商界及有关部门报告参观所得。
    西南区土产参观团曾携带西南区四千多种土、特产样品，在华东区和中南区两地土产展览交流大会上，和全国各地公私商代表广泛接洽，重新恢复了许多中断的商业关系，所推销的土产要比过去在外区零星推销大得多。此次西南区与区外各地订立了三百六十多亿元的土、特产交流合同和协议，其中百分之四十九是抗日战争以来就难得有人经营的东西。例如西南区很多药材在“九一八”后就不曾销售东北，这次在华东、中南两区和东北各地商业代表团订了合同，重销关外。再如川东广柑、云南火腿、川北银耳、川西蜀锦、绣缎等，也都恢复了旧销路或找到了新市场。云南火腿的上海销路中断已十多年，这次又由参观团与上海腌腊商订立了交易协议。
    西南区土产参观团曾详细调查了西南区土产在外销售情况，以便今后指导生产。参观团并认真搜集了各地在土产经营中的先进经验，作为西南区土产经营的借鉴。对于因西南区交通不便，和体积笨重的土产，和各地代表交换意见的结果，参观团认为可从加工方面寻找出路。西南土产参观团亲身体会到，地大人多的祖国，土产容纳量极大，经营土产的信心因而倍增。
