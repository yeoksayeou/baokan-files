Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 6th: The August 3rd issue of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties’ newspaper, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" published a commentary by Malek entitled "Afraid of Peace."

Malek wrote: U.S. Defense Secretary Marshall said fearfully last week that Malik's proposal for a ceasefire in Korea has seriously affected the advancement of the so-called "defense plan." Almost at the same time, Wilson, the head of the Defense Mobilization Agency, an official in charge of the war economy and representative of the Morgan family, announced that the slightest relaxation of international tensions is a threat to the U.S. economy. One of the heads of the Military Production Bureau, Fleischmann, was also afraid of peace, saying that a truce in Korea might cause a serious decline in military production.

When the "psychology of emergency" artificially created by the United States and the Marshallized countries begins to wane, Wall Street is greatly panicked. The above statements are only a small reflection of this panic.

The Wall Street Journal wrote on February 20th: Due to the threat of peace, the profits obtained by large-scale hoarding of materials may be lost. The newspaper repeated in panic on March 16th: The easing of the fear of war is causing the country to relax. The government doesn’t know what to do about it. Recently, the newspaper went mad and said that if the war stops, it will be difficult to prevent the implementation of military plans from slackening.

Other publications of monopoly capitalists also revealed the fear of peace that plagues the American merchants of death, and the fear that the American people will refuse to support the huge arms expansion plan. "U.S. News & World Report" shamelessly said: If defense plans are cut, the economy will be damaged.

But the most shameless and blatant expression of this fear of a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue is the Dutch local newspaper "Arnhem News" - lackeys often speak more undisguisedly than their masters. The newspaper wrote: "Please recall how stocks plummeted when Malik first proposed a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. What would happen if the United States and Western Europe suddenly reduced their armaments? ... If the Soviet Union insists on universal disarmament, the West will not be able to prosper… It is obvious that peace is more dangerous to us than war."

Everyone knows that the living standards of workers and peasants, clerks and handicraftsmen in the United States and Western Europe are declining sharply due to soaring prices, inflation and increased taxes. For ordinary people, peace is the only hope for improving their lives.

At the same time, everyone also knows that the profits of U.S. monopoly capital were 3.4 billion U.S. dollars per year in the pre-war years from 1936 to 1939, 8.7 billion U.S. dollars in the wartime years from 1940 to 1945, and have increased to 18.5 billion U.S. dollars in the post-war years from 1946 to 1950.

These figures show who peace is a real danger to!

The likes of Truman and Morrison hypocritically say that they dream of peace day and night. They want people to believe them, but their actual actions show that they are very afraid of peace and hate peace, because American monopoly capitalists who attempt to dominate the world rely on the blood of soldiers, the hunger and poverty of working people to increase their huge wealth.

　　美统治集团害怕和平
    【新华社布拉格六日电】八月三日出版的共产党与工人党情报局机关报《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》刊载马莱克的一篇评论，题为“害怕和平”。
    马莱克写道：美国国防部长马歇尔在上周恐惧地说，马立克的朝鲜停火建议已严重地影响了所谓“防御计划”的推进。几乎在同时，管理战争经济的官员、摩根家庭的代表、国防动员署长威尔生宣布：国际紧张局势的丝毫缓和，都是对美国经济的威胁。军事生产局首长之一佛莱西曼也害怕和平，他说：朝鲜境内的休战可能引起军事生产的严重低落。
    当美国和马歇尔化各国内人工制造出来的“紧急状态的心理”开始衰退时，华尔街大感恐慌，上述的一些声明只不过是这种恐慌的一小部分反映而已。
    二月二十日的华尔街日报写道：由于和平的威胁，靠大规模囤积物资所得的利润可能丧失。该报在三月十六日又以惊慌的心情重复说：害怕战争的心理之趋于缓和，正在使全国松懈下来。政府在这方面不知如何是好。在最近，该报又发狂地说，如果战争停止，那么就很难使军事计划的实施免于松懈。
    其他垄断资本家的刊物也透露了使得美国的死亡贩子困扰不安的那种害怕和平的心情，以及害怕美国人民拒绝支持庞大的扩军计划的心情。“美国新闻与世界报道”无耻地说：如果削减防御计划，经济就会受到损害。
    但是把这种害怕朝鲜问题和平解决的心理表现得最无耻、最露骨的是荷兰的地方报纸《安纳姆斯新闻报》——奴才说话是往往比主子更不加掩饰的。该报写道：“请回想一下，当马立克首先提出和平解决朝鲜问题的建议时，股票是怎样纷纷下跌的。如果美国和西欧突然减少它们的军备，那会发生怎样的后果呢？……如果苏联坚持普遍裁减军备，西方就无法繁荣，……显而易见，和平对我们的危险比战争还大。”
    大家都知道：由于物价飞涨、通货膨胀和捐税增加，美国和西欧的工人和农民、职员和手工业者的生活水准正在急剧下降。对于普通人民说来，有和平才有改善生活的希望。
    同时，大家也知道：在一九三六年到一九三九年的战前年代中，美国垄断资本的利润每年是三十四亿美元，在一九四○年到一九四五年的战时年代中是八十七亿美元，而在一九四六年到一九五○年的战后年代中，已增加到了一百八十五亿美元。
    这些数字说明，和平究竟对于那些人是真正的危险！
    杜鲁门和莫里逊之流虚伪地说：他们日夜梦想和平。他们要人民相信他们的话，但是他们的实际行动表明：他们是非常害怕和平，痛恨和平的，因为企图统治全球的美国垄断资本家是依靠兵士的鲜血、劳动人民的饥饿和贫穷来增加他们的庞大财富的。
