Xinhua News Agency dispatch:
　　American newspaper *The Wall Street Journal* admitted: The U.S. side has been delaying and obstructing the Korean armistice negotiations in every possible way, and one of its purposes is to buy time to wait for the signing of a separate peace treaty with Japan. According to a Dentsu News Agency dispatch from New York on the 21st: The Wall Street Journal's Washington correspondent wrote on August 17 regarding the armistice negotiations: "The American reaction is: to demand more in the Korean negotiations than the Communists are willing to concede. Unless the Communists completely surrender, the State Department is unwilling to conclude a ceasefire agreement before the San Francisco conference."

　　美国报纸供认美方阻挠谈判是企图先签订单独对日和约
    【新华社讯】美国《华尔街日报》承认：美国方面在朝鲜停战谈判中百般拖延阻挠，其目的之一是企图争取时间，以等待单独对日和约的签字。据电通社纽约二十一日电：八月十七的华尔街日报驻华盛顿记者就休战谈判写道：“美国的反应是：在朝鲜谈判中要求比我们预料共产党肯让步的还要多的东西。除非共产党完全屈服，在旧金山会议以前，国务院不愿缔结停火协定。”
