　　Chaotic Management of Northeast Forest Industry
    Substandard Timber and Failure to Differentiate Quality Cause Waste
    The Tendency of Timber-Using Departments to Only Want Korean Pine and Not Actively Utilize Miscellaneous Wood Should Also Be Corrected
    Oppose Waste of Timber, Oppose Indiscriminate Logging!
    The chaotic management of the Northeast Forest Industry Administration has caused enormous losses to the country. According to incomplete statistics from the Northeast People's Government Industry Department, losses on timber alone amounted to 680 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below) last year. Other losses caused by poor timber quality have not been calculated. Waste is caused by the following situations:
    Timber Size Does Not Meet User Needs
    First, production is not based on user needs, and most timber is not up to standard. For example, the Benxi Coal Mine needed small pit props 1.8 meters long in the second quarter of this year; however, the Forest Industry Bureau allocated 8,000 cubic meters, most of which were 3 meters long. Each piece had to be cut by 1.2 meters during use. Last year, the Northeast Electric Power Bureau needed electric poles 10 to 12 meters long to build transmission lines; however, the forestry departments allocated mostly poles less than 10 meters long. The Electric Power Bureau had no choice but to use the "joint foot" method to make do, which not only doubled the cost but also delayed three projects until this year.
    The types of trees allocated by the forestry departments were also very mixed and could not guarantee the service life. For example, more than 85 percent of the pit props received by the Northeast People's Government Industry Department last year were soft miscellaneous wood, mainly poplar and birch, which have a service life of five to six years shorter than hardwood. Pit props that should have been replaced every six to eight years now have to be replaced every one to two years. Moreover, these pit props are not strong and can easily cause accidents.
    In addition, the Forest Industry Administration also has a so-called regulation that "good timber must be matched with some short timber." Before receiving the timber, the user units do not know the specifications, and after receiving it, they have to pick and choose from the warehouse. According to reports, the maximum utilization rate of these short timbers is only 40 percent, and the rest become stagnant materials. Last year, this item alone resulted in a loss of 81 billion yuan.
    Many Decayed Timber
    Second, the timber is not properly stored, and there is too much decayed wood. According to statistics from the Northeast People's Government Industry Department, the average decay rate of timber used for construction and production last year was 7 percent. As late as March of this year, various units still had a backlog of 14,000 cubic meters of decayed wood. This year, decayed wood is still being allocated. In the first quarter of this year, of the 2,217 cubic meters of pine and miscellaneous logs allocated by the Jiling Timber Yard to the chemical, textile, electrical, and machinery bureaus, more than 900 cubic meters were so rotten that they could not be used. Among them, the 400 cubic meters of miscellaneous logs received by the Electrical Engineering Bureau were completely unusable. Of the 490 cubic meters of logs that the Chemical Bureau received from Jiling in February of this year, 150 cubic meters were so rotten that they shattered when dropped to the ground. Eighty percent or more of the 500 cubic meters of miscellaneous logs allocated by the Tieli Timber Yard to the Electrical Engineering Bureau were riddled with holes by ants.
    Good and Bad Timber Not Differentiated During Allocation
    Third, good and bad timber are not differentiated during allocation, and everything is included in one package. When the forestry departments allocate timber, they do not tell the user units the specifications, grades, and tree types in advance. When users receive the timber, it is allocated by the pile, regardless of whether the pile of timber is good or bad, what the specifications are, or whether the tree type is suitable. If they don't want it, the people at the timber yard will say, "Take it or leave it! If you have any opinions, go to the Administration to complain!" Last year, the Huangsongdianzi Timber Yard allocated a pile of miscellaneous logs to a textile factory in April, which turned out to be different inside and out. On the surface, they looked like good wood, but when loading the truck, it was discovered that the pile was full of rotten wood, and more than 70 percent could not be used.
    These phenomena not only seriously waste state resources but also directly affect production and engineering quality. For example, when a coal mine built houses last year, Korean pine should have been used for doors and windows, but white pine was allocated; Korean pine was allocated when it was not needed for the house frame. The white pine logs allocated for papermaking not only doubled the cost per ton of paper due to the excessive moisture content but also caused frequent paper breaks due to excessive resin in the pulp.
    Timber Management Departments and Users Disconnected
    The main shortcoming of the Northeast Forest Industry Administration in management is that it rarely contacts users, and the timber production plan is out of sync with the timber demand plan. The Northeast People's Government Industry Department submitted last year's timber consumption plan in August of the year before last, and the bureau did not raise any objections to the plan at that time. However, when the Industry Department went to inquire, the chief of the bureau's Timber Section actually said: "The plan submitted by the Industry Department is only for reference..." This year's pit prop, electric pole, and other timber consumption plans were also submitted in October of last year; however, the problems with pit props and electric poles this year have not been reduced.
    The timber-using departments also have shortcomings, such as not being able to submit timber consumption plans more promptly; some engineering designers do not consider the timber production situation in the Northeast and only know that they want Korean pine and white pine, and rarely actively study the use of miscellaneous wood, etc. While these shortcomings should be corrected by the timber-using departments, they must also be thoroughly overcome by strengthening management in the Forest Industry Administration.

　　东北森林工业管理工作混乱
    木材不合规格好坏不分造成许多浪费
    用材部门只知要红松而不主动利用杂木的现象也应纠正
    反对浪费木材，反对滥伐林木！
    东北森林工业管理局管理工作混乱，给国家造成巨大损失。据东北人民政府工业部不完全统计：仅去年一年在木材上的损失就有六千八百多亿元（东北币，下同）。由于木材质量不好而造成的其他损失还没有计算在内。浪费是由以下几种情况造成的：
    木材大小不合用户需用
    第一，不根据用户需要生产，木材多不合规格。譬如本溪煤矿今年第二季需要一·八公尺长的小坑木；但森林工业局拨去八千立方公尺，大部分是三公尺长的。使用时每棵要截去一·二公尺。东北电业局去年修建送电线路，需要十公尺到十二公尺长的电柱；林务部门拨去的却多半是十公尺以下的。电业局没有办法，只好用“接脚”办法凑合着用，不仅成本增高了一倍，而且影响三处工程拖到今年才施工。
    林务部门拨下的树木种类也很杂乱，不能保证使用年限。如去年东北人民政府工业部领到的坑木，百分之八十五以上是杨、桦为主的软杂木，和硬杂木相比，寿命要短五年到六年。本来应该六年到八年抽换一次的坑木，现在一年到二年就得抽换。而且这种坑木不结实，容易酿成事故。
    另外，森林工业管理局还有所谓“领好材必须配上点短材”的规定。在领用以前，用材单位不知道规格，领回来只好放在库里挑着用。据反映这些短材的最大利用率不过百分之四十，其余全部变成呆滞材料了。去年一年这项损失共八百一十亿元。
    腐朽了的木材很多
    第二，木材保管得不好，腐朽的木头太多。据东北人民政府工业部统计：去年修建和生产用的木材，腐朽率平均达百分之七。一直到今年三月份，各单位还积压一万四千立方公尺的朽材。今年朽材仍然源源拨来。今年第一季度仅鸡岭贮木场拨给化工、纺织、电工、机械等局的两千二百十七立方公尺松杂原木中，就有九百多立方公尺腐朽得不能使用。其中电工局领到的四百立方公尺杂原木竟完全不能使用。化工局今年二月从鸡岭领来四百九十立方公尺原木，有一百五十立方公尺腐朽得往地下一摔就碎了。铁骊木场拨给电工局五百立方公尺杂原木，有百分之八十以上被蚂蚁咬得尽是空洞。
    拨发木材时好坏不分
    第三，拨发木材时好坏不分，一包在内。林务部门拨给木材时，事先不把木材的规格等级和树木种类告诉使用单位。用户领取时就论堆拨给，不管这一堆木材是好是坏，规格如何，树木种类是否合适。如果不要，木场的人便说：“爱要不要，不领拉倒！有意见到管理局提去！”去年四月黄松甸子贮木场拨给纺织厂一堆杂原木，竟里外不一样。从表面看是好木头，但装车时发现垛里都是朽材，百分之七十以上不能用。
    这些现象不仅严重浪费国家资财，而且直接影响了生产和工程质量。如某煤矿去年盖房子，做门窗的时候应该用红松，而拨来的是白松；做房架子时不需要红松，却拨来了红松。拨给造纸用的白松原木，因含水率过大，不仅使每吨纸成本提高了一倍，而且因为纸浆中树脂过多，使抄纸经常断头。
    木材管理部门和用户脱节
    东北森林工业管理局在管理上的主要缺点是很少和用户联系，木材生产计划和木材需用计划脱节。去年的用材计划，东北人民政府工业部在前年八月就提出来了，当时该局对这个计划没有提出任何意见。但当工业部去询问时，该局木材科科长竟说：“工业部提的计划，只当个参考就是啦……。”今年坑木、电柱等用材计划，也是在去年十月就提出的；但是今年坑木、电柱上的问题并未减少。
    用材部门也有缺点，比如不能更及时地提出用材计划；部分工程设计人员不考虑东北木材生产情况，只知道要红松、白松，很少主动研究利用杂木等。这些缺点，一方面要用材部门注意纠正，一方面也还是要从森林工业管理局加强管理来彻底克服。
