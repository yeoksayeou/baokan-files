　　Resolutely Abolish the Feudal Foreman System in the Construction Industry
    ——Worker's Daily Editorial, August 26

    The National Construction Workers' Union Work Conference held in Beijing in June this year pointed out the serious existence of foreman rule and feudal exploitation in the current construction industry. Today's news about the anti-foreman movement in the Xuzhou construction industry fully proves this point and demonstrates how urgent it is to solve this problem!

    The foreman system originated from the contracting system of the old construction industry. Under the contracting system, construction companies and construction firms were not responsible for recruiting workers and allocating labor, but this work was undertaken by foremen who specialized in intermediary exploitation. Layer upon layer of subcontracting, layer upon layer of exploitation, slave-like rule, and illegal oppression arose from this. After liberation, the organizational leadership of the construction industry in various regions had not yet gotten on track, the old system had not yet been reformed, but the task of basic construction was already very urgent. Some responsible cadres of our public construction companies, under these circumstances, actually forgot the fundamental issue that the people's construction cause should and must rely on the working class to be successful. They relied on foremen to complete tasks in the same way as the old construction companies; or even, in the name of "production," aimed solely at making money, mixed with private construction firms, disregarded the interests of national construction, and ignored the suffering of workers from feudal exploitation, safely getting caught in the vortex of layer upon layer of subcontracting (the practice of the Xuzhou branch of the Shandong Construction Engineering Company, published in this newspaper today, is a typical example). Therefore, this old system continued to exist, or existed in disguised form.

    The exploitation of workers by foremen is extremely cruel. According to representatives who participated in the National Construction Workers' Union Work Conference: in some areas, the actual wages received by workers accounted for only 30% to 50% of the wages they should have received; 50% to 70% of the wages workers should have received were seized by the foremen. Moreover, even the meager amount actually received by workers, the foremen still tried to exploit in every possible way, by inventing various pretexts. Such as taking over meals, deducting furniture costs, and so on. A certain foreman in Beijing, because of tax evasion, was fined by the government. The foreman forced the workers to "petition for exemption from the fine" to the government. When the workers refused to go, the foreman apportioned the government's fine to the workers on a daily basis. What an appalling thing! Under the foremen's layer upon layer of bone-scraping exploitation, it was already very difficult for workers to get enough to eat, let alone study technology and improve project quality. Therefore, sloppy work, low efficiency, massive waste of materials, and low project quality became a common phenomenon, and in the end, it was our country's basic construction cause that suffered the losses.

    The problem is very clear: if we want to ensure the completion of the state's basic construction tasks, we must abolish the foreman system in the construction industry and thoroughly liberate the vast number of construction workers politically and economically. Without this, we will not have a strong and powerful mass force to rely on, and there will be no serious reform actions against the old construction industry!

    However, the foremen in the construction industry are somewhat different from the foremen in coal mines and among transport workers. In terms of exploitation methods and the nature of exploitation, both are feudalistic super-economic exploitation. However, many of the foremen in the construction industry are technical workers by origin, they have certain design and construction experience, and some small foremen also participate in labor themselves. In order to utilize this part of the force in the construction cause, the method of anti-foreman in the construction industry should also be different from that of coal miners and transport workers. Except for a few who are hated by the workers and have blood debts, who must be punished according to law, the rest of the foremen in the construction industry should be educated and reformed, so that they have the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves. After they bow their heads to the workers, admit their guilt, and give up their exploitative life, they should be allowed to continue working and contribute their strength to the country's construction industry.

    Secondly, according to the preliminary experience of various regions, the anti-foreman system struggle in the construction industry should also pay attention to the following points:

    1.  Due to the continued existence of the contracting system, many public and private construction companies or construction firms rely almost entirely on the foreman system to recruit workers and carry out construction. Therefore, some administrative personnel or trade union workers are worried about the anti-foreman movement, using the excuses of "urgent work," "foremen have technology, and tasks cannot be completed without relying on foremen," or saying that "anti-foreman cannot be carried out without a new management system," and are unwilling to oppose foremen, or are afraid of "scaring the snake," and therefore do not dare to oppose foremen. Therefore, clearing the minds of administrative and trade union cadres of these specious ideas, and firmly establishing the confidence in relying on workers to do a good job in the people's construction industry, is a prerequisite for carrying out the anti-foreman struggle.

    2.  Since the purpose of the anti-foreman struggle is to remove the heavy shackles on construction workers, it must become a movement of the workers themselves. To this end, workers must be organized, and workers must be educated and their class consciousness raised by exposing the criminal facts of the foreman system, so that the worker masses consciously smash this feudal exploitation system. It is absolutely impossible to overthrow the foremen by relying solely on a piece of order, nor can it be done by administrative or trade union cadres substituting for them. Even simply abolishing the foreman system in terms of system is not enough to replace the workers' conscious struggle. A certain public construction company in Beijing, in order to abolish the intermediate exploitation of the foremen, directly distributed the excess bonus money (usually called "profit sharing" in the Beijing construction industry) that the workers should have received to the workers, but after leaving the company, the workers still pooled the money and handed it over to the foremen. This example is worth studying in depth.

    3.  In the anti-foreman struggle, it is necessary to simultaneously solve the problem of fixed workers and unified allocation of labor. Two years after the basic liberation of the mainland of China, the foremen still have great control over the workers, doing whatever they want, looking arrogant. The fundamental problem here is that the foremen have the power to recruit, allocate, and dismiss workers. Some construction workers in Beijing said: The trade union is good, but it cannot always give work to do, the foreman exploits, but he can find work to do. Some workers compare the trade union to smoke, and the foreman to food, saying that "smoke can not be smoked; food cannot not be eaten." Some pile driving workers in Shanghai said: "Even if there is exploitation, we still follow the foreman." These workers see the foreman as a "deflated nipple" - "Although we can't get enough to eat, as long as we hold on tight, we won't starve to death!" Each company fixes a certain number of workers, and the labor administrative departments and trade unions of the government are responsible for the unified allocation of labor in the construction industry. On the one hand, this can make construction and labor allocation more planned, ensure a sufficient supply of labor, and avoid waste of manpower. At the same time, it also fundamentally eliminates the material basis for the foremen to control the workers.

    4.  In the anti-foreman movement, it is necessary to educate the workers on resisting the United States and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, establish and consolidate the construction workers' sense of ownership, let everyone be vigilant at all times, prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements, and avoid damage to projects; and promptly guide the workers' enthusiasm to production, pay attention to improving the labor conditions on the site, and solve the workers' living difficulties on the basis of completing work tasks and ensuring project quality. We must prevent the movement from being directed towards simply "asking for money" and "settling accounts," so that it becomes disconnected from the current central task and production and construction tasks of the country.

　　坚决废除建筑业中的封建把头制度
    ——工人日报八月二十六日社论
    今年六月间在北京召开的全国建筑业工会工作会议，曾指出了目前建筑业中存在着严重的把头统治和封建剥削。今日刊登的徐州市建筑业反把头的消息，更充分证明这一点，也说明了解决这个问题是多么迫切！
    把头制度，起源于旧建筑业的包工制。在包工制度下，建筑公司和营造厂不负招揽工人和调配劳动力的责任，而由专门从事中间剥削的把头来担负这一工作。层层转包，层层剥削，奴隶式的统治，非法的压迫，便由此产生。解放以后，各地区对建筑业的组织领导还没有走上轨道，旧的制度还没有经过改革，基本建设的任务却已十分紧迫。我们有些公营建筑公司的负责干部，在这种情况下面，竟忘掉了人民的建筑事业也应该和必须依靠工人阶级才能搞好这样一个根本问题。他们与旧的建筑公司毫无区别地依靠把头来完成任务；甚或以“生产”为名，单纯以赚钱为目的，和私营营造厂商混到一起，不顾国家建设的利益，也不顾工人群众遭受封建剥削的痛苦，安然卷入层层转包的漩涡中去（象本报今天发表的山东建筑工程公司徐州分公司的那种做法，就是一个典型的例子）。因此，这种旧制度得以继续存在，或改头换面，变相存在。
    把头们对工人的剥削是十分残酷的。据参加全国建筑业工会工作会议的代表反映：有些地区，工人实得工资仅占应得工资的百分之三十到五十；工人应得工资的百分之五十到七十，都被把头们剥夺去了。而且，连工人实得的这区区之数，把头们也还要巧立名目，想尽花样，加以剥削。如代办伙食，扣家具费等等。北京市某把头，因为偷漏国税被政府罚款，把头强制工人去向政府“请愿免罚”。工人没有去，把头就把政府对他的罚款，按日摊派到工人身上去。这是何等骇人听闻的事！在把头们敲骨及髓地层层盘剥下，工人们求得一饱，已经很不容易，当然谈不上怎样去钻研技术，提高工程质量。因此，工作草率，效率不高，材料大量浪费，工程质量低下，就成为普遍现象，而最后蒙受损失的是我们国家的基本建设事业。
    问题十分明显，如果我们要保证国家基本建设任务的完成，那就必须废除建筑业中的把头制，使广大建筑工人在政治上经济上彻底解放。没有这一条，我们就不会有坚强的雄厚的群众力量作依靠，就谈不到什么对旧建筑业的严肃的改革行动！
    但是，建筑业中的把头和煤矿、搬运工人中的把头，还有些不同。从剥削方法和剥削性质来说，二者都是封建性的超经济剥削。但建筑业的把头，不少是技术工人出身，他们有一定的设计和施工经验，有些小把头自己也参加劳动。为了利用这一部分力量到建设事业中去，建筑业反把头的方法，也就应该和煤矿、搬运工人等有所区别。对建筑业的把头，除掉少数为工人痛恨的和有血债的分子须依法惩办外，对其余的均应设法加以教育改造，使他们得到自新的机会。当他们向工人低头认罪放弃其剥削生活之后，应当让他们继续工作，为国家的建筑工业贡献他们的力量。
    其次，根据各地区的初步经验，建筑业反把头制度的斗争，还要注意以下几点：
    一、由于包工制度的继续存在，许多公私建筑公司或营造厂。差不多完全依靠把头制度来招雇工人和进行施工。所以有些行政人员或工会工作者，就对反把头抱有顾虑，借口“工作紧急”，“把头有技术，不依靠把头不能完成任务”，或者说“没有一套新的管理制度无法反把头”，因而不愿反把头，或怕“打草惊蛇”，因而不敢反把头。因此，清除行政和工会干部这种似是而非的思想，坚定依靠工人搞好人民建筑工业的信心，是开展反把头斗争的先决条件。
    二、反把头斗争，既然目的是解除建筑工人身上的重重枷锁，它就必须要成为工人群众自己的运动。为此，就要把工人组织起来，通过揭露把头制度的罪恶事实，教育工人，提高工人的阶级觉悟，由工人群众自觉地去打碎这个封建剥削制度，绝不可能单靠一纸命令就反了把头，也不是由行政或工会干部代替包办所能办成的。甚至单从制度上废除把头制度也不足以代替工人群众自觉的斗争。北京某公营建筑公司，为了废除把头的中间剥削，把工人应得的超额奖励金（北京的建筑业通常叫做“分红”）直接分发给工人，但离开公司以后，工人还是把钱凑出来交给把头。这一事例，值得我们深刻研究。
    三、在反把头斗争中，一定要同时解决固定工人和统一调配劳动力的问题。在全国大陆基本解放已经两年的今天，把头仍然对工人具有极大的控制力，想怎样便怎样，神气十足。这里边的根本问题，是把头掌握了招收、调配和解雇工人的大权。北京有些建筑工人表示：工会是好，但不能常给工作做，把头剥削，但他能给找活做。有的工人把工会比作烟，把把头比作饭，说是“烟可以不抽；饭不能不吃”。上海有些打桩工人表示：“虽有剥削，也跟把头。”这些工人把把头看作是一只“瘪奶头”——“虽说吃不饱，但只要抱紧了，也不会饿死！”各公司固定一定数量的工人，由政府的劳动行政部门和工会负责，统一调配建筑业的劳动力，一方面可以使施工和人力调配更有计划，保证劳动力的充分供应，避免人力的浪费，同时也就从根本上消灭了把头控制工人的物质基础。
    四、在反把头运动中，一定要对职工进行抗美援朝和镇压反革命的教育，树立和巩固建筑工人的主人翁思想，让大家随时提高警惕，防止反革命分子的破坏，避免工程遭受损失；并及时把工人的热情引向生产，注意改善现场的劳动条件，在完成工作任务、保证工程质量的基础上来解决工人的生活困难。要防止把运动引向单纯地“要钱”、“算账”，以致与当前全国的中心任务和生产建设任务脱节。
