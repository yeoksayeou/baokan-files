The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Telegram to the People's Liberation Army

To Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

August 1st is the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army is a true people's army personally established by Chairman Mao and you. After 24 years of struggle, it finally defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries armed by American imperialism and achieved the great victory of the Chinese revolution. You are the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the heroes who created the new society, and the liberators and defenders of our working class and the people of the whole country. As we commemorate the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army today, we cannot help but thank you and pay you our highest respects!

Now American imperialism is still intensifying its policy of aggression: it still occupies our territory of Taiwan; it is actively arming Japan and West Germany; it is still constantly creating difficulties in the Korean armistice negotiations. Recognizing this situation, we workers across the country are willing to assure you that we will use all our strength to support your efforts. We will continue to carry out the movement to increase production and make donations to help you build a strong, modernized national defense force; we will do a good job in providing preferential treatment to the families of martyrs, military families, and disabled veterans, and regard supporting the People's Liberation Army as a regular political task. We will fight to the end to consolidate the national defense of our great motherland and to defend our independent, prosperous, and happy great motherland.

Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

We deeply know that true peace can only be achieved through serious struggle. We will never slacken our fighting will because of the Korean armistice negotiations. We will resolutely stand at our work posts, further carry out the movement to increase production and make donations and the patriotic labor emulation movement, and produce more and better weapons and materials to support you and to strengthen national defense and economic construction.

Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

Today, as we celebrate the great "August 1st" Army Day, we represent our sisters across the country, thank you, and extend our highest respects!

Women across the country, together with the people of the whole country, have destroyed the reactionary rule of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism, and are actively creating our happy life; in the great movement to resist America and aid Korea, we are participating in various patriotic practical actions with unprecedented surging enthusiasm, fully supporting you; at present, women across the country will not slacken in the slightest because of the Korean peace talks, and are continuing to expand and consolidate the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, redoubling our efforts to increase production, improve work, actively complete donation tasks, and earnestly do a good job in providing preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and military families, consolidate the national defense of the motherland, and strive for the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea.

　　各团体致电祝贺建军节
            全国总工会致解放军电中国人民解放军朱总司令及全体指挥员战斗员同志：
    八月一日，是中国人民解放军建军的二十四周年纪念日。人民解放军，是毛主席和你亲手建立起来的真正人民自己的军队。经过二十四年的奋斗，终于打垮了美帝国主义武装起来的国民党反动派，取得了中国革命的伟大胜利。你们是中国人民最优秀的儿女，是创造新社会的功臣，是我们工人阶级和全国人民的解放者和保卫者。当我们今天来纪念中国人民解放军建军二十四周年的时候，我们不能不感谢你们，不能不向你们致以崇高的敬礼！
    现在美帝国主义仍然在加紧实行侵略政策：它仍然霸占着我们的领土台湾；它正在积极武装日本和武装西德；它在朝鲜停战谈判中还在不断制造困难。认识到这种形势，我们全国工人都愿向你们保证，用一切力量来支援你们的努力。我们要继续进行增产捐献运动，来帮助你们建设强大的近代化的国防军；我们要做好优待烈属、军属、残废军人的工作，把拥护人民解放军当成经常的政治任务。我们要为巩固我们伟大祖国的国防，为保卫我们独立、富强、幸福的伟大祖国而斗争到底。
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！

    值此中国人民解放军建军二十四周年纪念的时候，我们谨代表中国全体工人向你们致以崇高的敬礼和亲切的慰问。由于你们发扬了人民解放军的英勇精神，志愿出国，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，打败了最凶恶的美帝国主义侵略军，扭转了朝鲜的局势，保障了祖国的安全，使朝鲜问题有了和平解决的可能。你们这一伟大贡献，获得全国和全世界人民的拥护与尊敬，鼓舞了全国和全世界人民为保卫世界和平，反对侵略战争的信心和决心。我们深切知道、真正的和平，只有经过严重的斗争才能取得、我们决不因朝鲜停战谈判而丝毫松懈我们的斗争意志，我们坚决站在自己的工作岗位上，进一步开展增产捐献运动和爱国主义劳动竞赛运动，生产更多更好的武器和物资来支援你们，来加强国防力量与经济建设。
    中国人民志愿军万岁！

    你们为祖国人民的解放和幸福，为全世界人民的和平，立下了伟大的功绩。我们全国妇女深切地了解，没有中国人民解放军二十四年艰苦斗争的胜利，没有中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的英勇作战，严重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略行为，我们妇女、母亲和儿童的安全和幸福，是绝不可能的。在庆祝伟大“八一”建军节的今天，我们代表全国姊妹，感谢你们，并致以崇高的敬礼！
    全国妇女和全国人民在一起，摧毁了帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义的反动政权，并积极创造我们幸福的生活；在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，又以空前的汹涌澎湃的热情，参加各种爱国的实际行动，全力支援你们；目前，全国妇女绝不因朝鲜和谈而有丝毫松懈，正在继续扩大与巩固抗美援朝的爱国运动，百倍努力提高生产，改进工作，积极完成捐献任务，切实做好烈属军属的优抚工作，巩固祖国的国防，争取抗美援朝的胜利。
    祝你们从胜利走向胜利，争取更大的光荣！
