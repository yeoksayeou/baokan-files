　　Eliminating the Chaotic Phenomenon of Randomly Poaching Cadres
    In some state-owned and private enterprises, government agencies, and schools, it has recently been discovered that there is a phenomenon of randomly poaching technical personnel and cadres by using material benefits and superior work positions as inducements, or through personal relationships. This is extremely wrong. It fosters the mobility and instability of some technical personnel, creates confusion in the personnel system, and damages the country's various construction efforts. Therefore, it must be strictly corrected and stopped.
    This phenomenon occurs more frequently in some privately owned enterprises. For the sake of their own enterprise's development, they do not hesitate to use despicable means to poach currently employed personnel from other places. For example, Tianjin's private Longshun Construction Factory enticed three engineering technicians from the state-owned Northeast Anshan Engineering Company, causing them to abandon their ongoing crash project tasks and go to Tianjin to take on new positions in the factory. Another example is the Shanghai Times Culture Model Factory, which poached eight technicians and ordinary workers from the World Culture Model Factory with high salaries, causing part of the production of the World Culture Model Factory to come to a standstill (according to the Shanghai Liberation Daily). This practice of harming and destroying one enterprise to benefit one's own is a despicable behavior of capitalists competing and fighting each other in capitalist society; in our new democratic society, such chaotic phenomena are not allowed to occur.
    Secondly, some state-owned enterprises, government agencies, and schools also often randomly poach cadres without going through the organizational system. The personnel workers in these units severely lack an overall perspective and have serious organizational and disciplinary deficiencies. There are also some people who treat today's national personnel work with the old ways of private lobbying from the old society. These must be strictly corrected.
    As for some of the poached personnel, they jump around for the sake of certain personal interests, unable to work steadily, and unable to honestly contribute the technology and work abilities they have acquired under the support of the people and the education of the state to the people. Their actions show that they are neither good cadres nor truly patriotic people, and their practices should be criticized and opposed by the people.

　　消除乱拉干部的混乱现象
    在某些国营及私营企业、机关、学校中，近来发现有以物质待遇和优越的工作地位为引诱，或通过私人关系，乱拉技术人员、乱拉干部的现象。这是非常错误的。它助长了某些技术人员的流动性和不安心工作，造成人事制度的混乱，损害了国家的各项建设工作，所以必须严加纠正与制止。
    这种现象较多地发生在某些私人资本家经营的企业中。他们为着自己企业的发展，就不惜以卑劣的手段去拉拢别处的在职人员。如天津私营隆顺营造厂，引诱国营东北鞍山工程公司的三个工程技术人员，使他们弃掉正在进行的突击工程任务而到天津担任该厂的新职。又如上海时代文化模型厂，以高工资拉去世界文化模型厂的八名技工和普遍工人，致使世界文化模型厂的一部分生产陷于停顿（据上海解放日报载）。这种损害、破坏另一企业而成全本企业的作法，是资本家们在资本主义社会互相争夺、倾轧的卑污行为；在我们新民主主义社会中，是不允许发生这种混乱现象的。
    其次，某些国营企业、政府机关及学校，也常常不通过组织系统，乱拉干部。这些单位的人事工作人员，十分缺乏整体观念，存在着严重的无组织无纪律思想；也还有某些人，以旧社会私人拉拢的旧作风，来对待今天国家的人事工作。这些都是必须严加纠正的。
    对某些被拉的人员来说，他们只是为着某些个人的利益，就跳来跳去，不能踏踏实实地工作，不能把在人民的供养和国家的教育下所获得的技术和工作能力，老老实实地贡献给人民。他们这样作了，就说明他们既不是一个好干部，也不是一个真正爱国的人民，他们的这种做法应该受到人民的批评和反对。
