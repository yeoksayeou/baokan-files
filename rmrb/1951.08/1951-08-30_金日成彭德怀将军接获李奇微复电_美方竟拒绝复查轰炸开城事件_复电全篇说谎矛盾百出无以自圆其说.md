Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, received today a reply from Ridgway in response to their telegram of August 27th regarding the serious provocative incident of the U.S. side bombing the Kaesong neutral zone. In this reply, Ridgway stubbornly refused to answer directly the various questions and arguments raised by Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai. He obstinately refused to order U.S. liaison officers to go to the Kaesong area with our liaison officers to reinvestigate the incident of U.S. aircraft bombing near the accommodation of our delegation. He also deliberately obscured the fact that our side did not refuse to continue the investigation during the daytime after the investigation by the liaison officers of both sides on the night of August 23rd. He lied, saying, "Your liaison officer, Colonel Zhang, explicitly refused my liaison officer's request to continue the investigation during the daytime on the night of August 23rd and left all the so-called material evidence at the original location." "After this period of time, your current request to allow another reinvestigation... would be of no use." Everyone already knows that the claim that our liaison officer refused the U.S. liaison officer to conduct a reinvestigation is a lie that has long been discredited. The fact is that after the U.S. aircraft bombing incident in the neutral zone on the night of the 22nd, the U.S. liaison officer first excused himself due to the late hour and refused to come to Kaesong for investigation. Later, upon arriving at the scene, he stated that the material evidence of the U.S. aircraft bombing was not worth seeing and falsely claimed that the darkness made investigation inconvenient, suggesting a daytime investigation instead. Our liaison officer immediately informed him that the existing evidence was already conclusive and there was no need for further investigation, but our side did not refuse the U.S. side from coming again for reinvestigation the next morning, only requiring prior contact by radio. However, on the morning of August 23rd, the U.S. liaison officer himself did not come for reinvestigation but hastily published a so-called investigation report, falsely accusing our side of refusing reinvestigation. Ridgway, in his reply, inevitably fell into logical contradictions because of lying. On the one hand, Ridgway falsely accused our side of refusing to continue the investigation, and on the other hand, he stubbornly refused our request to conduct a reinvestigation. How can this be justified?
　　Ridgway cannot explain the world's question: Why does the person who claims to be requesting reinvestigation refuse reinvestigation, while the person who is accused of refusing reinvestigation requests reinvestigation? Why is Ridgway so afraid of reinvestigation, almost like a criminal afraid of the final judgment? Ridgway's liaison officer said that the night investigation was unreliable, so why does Ridgway insist on relying on this unreliable investigation while refusing to conduct a more reliable investigation? Ridgway said that our evidence is unreliable, so why does Ridgway not dare to send someone to prove this unreliability in the reinvestigation? All this proves Ridgway's contradictions and embarrassment.

　　金日成彭德怀将军接获李奇微复电
    美方竟拒绝复查轰炸开城事件
    复电全篇说谎矛盾百出无以自圆其说
    【新华社二十九日讯】李奇微今天复电朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，答复他们于二十七日向李奇微提出的关于对美方轰炸开城中立区的严重挑衅事件进行复查的电报。李奇微在这个复电中拒绝正面答复金日成彭德怀两将军所提出的各项问题和各项论证，只是顽固地拒绝命令美方的联络官到开城地区与我方联络官对于美国飞机轰炸我方代表团住所附近的事件进行复查，并故意抹煞我方在八月二十三日夜间双方联络官调查后并未拒绝在白天继续调查的事实，撒谎说：“你方联络官张上校于八月二十三日夜间明确拒绝了我方联络官所提出的在白天继续进行调查，并将一切所谓物证留置原地的要求。”“经过这一段时间之后，你方现在提出准许再进行一次复查，………不会有任何用处”。任何人都已知道：所谓我方联络官拒绝美方联络官进行复查的说法，是早已破产了的谎言。事实是：在二十二日夜间美机轰炸中立区事件发生后，美方联络官首先托辞深夜，不肯前来开城调查，后来到了现场，又表示美机轰炸的物证不值得一看，并诡称黑夜不便调查，等到白天再来调查。我方联络官当即告以现有证据已经确凿，本可无须再查，但我方并不拒绝美方明晨再来复查，只需先由无线电话联络，可是到了八月二十三日白天，美方联络官自己却并不前来复查，反而连忙发表了所谓调查报告，并诬称我方拒绝复查。李奇微在复电中因为说谎而不能不陷入逻辑的矛盾。李奇微一方面诬称我方拒绝继续进行调查，一方面自己顽固地拒绝我方所提出的进行复查的要求。这究竟怎样自圆其说呢？
    李奇微无法解释全世界的疑问：为什么自称为要求复查的人拒绝复查，而被称为拒绝复查的人却要求复查呢？李奇微对于复查为什么如此害怕，简直像罪人害怕最后审判一样呢？李奇微的联络官说：黑夜的调查是不可靠的，那么，为什么李奇微又坚持依赖这个不可靠的调查，而拒绝进一步作可靠的调查呢？李奇微说我方的证据都是不可靠的，为什么李奇微不敢派人来在复查中证明这种不可靠呢？这一切都证明李奇微的矛盾和狼狈。
