Cultural Life Dynamics

Cadres in Yishui Special District, Shandong, Gain from Studying Party History

Cadres in Yishui Special District, Shandong Province, have significantly improved their ideological level after a month of studying Party history. In early July, the district, based on a notice from the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC, stipulated that the study should focus on Comrade Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" and Comrade Chen Boda's "Mao Zedong Thought is the Combination of Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese Revolution." District and township cadres were to primarily study Comrade Bo Yibo's "Strengthening the Party's Political Work in Rural Areas."

After the study, cadres initially recognized that the great victory of the Chinese revolution was inseparable from the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao; they also recognized that revolution means breaking the old relations of production and establishing new ones, thus realizing that the revolution must be led by the working class. The erroneous understanding that the Chinese revolution was led by peasants or intellectuals was also corrected during the study.

Cadres also gained a relatively deep understanding of the truth that Mao Zedong Thought is a combination of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, thereby feeling more keenly the importance of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

During the study, most comrades connected with reality. Some comrades reflected: "Today's victory was bought with the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs. We still consider ourselves heroes, demand status, and seek personal enjoyment. Looking back, we are truly sorry to the Party, sorry to Chairman Mao, and sorry to the revolutionary martyrs."

However, some units did not grasp the study tightly and did not organize it well, causing the study to fall into a state of self-flow. Some county-level leading cadres even failed to recognize the importance of Party history study and did not guarantee study time. The study of district and township cadres was generally the worst, and leading comrades did not conduct timely inspections and guidance.

"Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" Sells Over 250,000 Copies

Comrade Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" is an important work for studying Party history. After the book was published in early July, according to statistics from the People's Publishing House, by the end of July, the People's Publishing House across the country had printed twelve editions, with a total print run of 251,500 copies.

(The figures reprinted by various agencies, organizations, and publishing houses based on newspapers are not included in this statistic.)

Time Publishing House Celebrates its 10th Anniversary

To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the publishing house and the magazine "Time," and the transformation of the publishing house into a state-owned enterprise, the Time Publishing House held a cocktail party at its Shanghai branch on the 20th evening to entertain cultural, news, and publishing circles in East China and Shanghai. Pan Hannian, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Shanghai, Xia Yan, General Secretary, Chen Wangdao, Minister of Culture of the East China Military and Political Committee, Viriashagin, Acting Consul General of the Soviet Union in Shanghai, Bian Menov, Deputy Director of the TASS General Branch in China, and more than a hundred other people went to congratulate. Note: Time Publishing House was founded in Shanghai in 1941 by Soviet friends. Over the past ten years, it has published Chinese "Time" magazine, "Time Daily," "Soviet Literature and Art," "Soviet Medicine," Russian "Time" magazine, English "Daily War News" and other publications, as well as 365 kinds of Chinese, Russian, English, German, and Japanese books, with a total circulation of more than 2.18 million copies. These books and periodicals have made great achievements in introducing the Soviet Union and Soviet literary and artistic works to the Chinese people. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山东沂水专区干部学习党史有收获
    山东省沂水专区干部经过一个月的党史学习，思想水平显著提高。该专区在七月初根据中共山东分局宣传部通知，规定以胡乔木同志的“中国共产党的三十年”与陈伯达同志的“毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义与中国革命的结合”两篇文章为主进行学习。区乡干部则以薄一波同志的“加强党在农村中的政治工作”为主要学习文件。
    经过学习以后，干部们都初步认识了中国革命的伟大胜利，是与中国共产党、毛主席的正确领导分不开的；同时也认识了革命就是打破旧的生产关系，建立新的生产关系，从而认识到革命必须由工人阶级来领导。认为中国革命是由农民或知识分子领导的错误认识，也在学习中得到了纠正。
    对于毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的真理，干部们也有了比较深切的体会，从而更感到学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的重要。
    在学习中，一般同志都联系了实际。有的同志检讨说：“今天的胜利是无数革命先烈用鲜血换来的，咱还以功臣自居、闹地位、闹个人享受，回想起来真是对不起党，对不起毛主席，对不起革命先烈。”
    但在学习中，有些单位抓的不紧，没有很好进行组织工作，致使学习陷于自流。有的县级领导干部，甚至没有认识到党史学习的重要，连学习时间也不予保证。区乡干部的学习一般是最差的，领导同志没有及时进行检查和辅导。
  “中国共产党的三十年”  销数达二十五万余册
    胡乔木同志著“中国共产党的三十年”，是学习党史的一本重要著作。该书在七月初出版后，据人民出版社统计：截至七月底止，全国各地人民出版社已印行了十二版，总印数达二五一、五○○册。
    （各地机关、团体、出版社根据报纸上翻印的数字，还没有列入此项统计）。
  时代出版社庆祝建社十周年
    时代出版社为庆祝该社建社及《时代》杂志创刊十周年并为该社改为我国公营企业，特于二十日晚在该社上海分社举行酒会，招待华东区及上海市文化、新闻、出版界。上海中苏友好协会副会长潘汉年、总干事夏衍，华东军政委员会文化部部长陈望道，苏联驻沪代理总领事维里夏金，塔斯社驻华总分社副社长边缅诺夫等百余人前往祝贺。按：时代出版社成立于一九四一年，由苏联友人在上海创办。十年来曾出版中文《时代》杂志、《时代日报》、《苏联文艺》、《苏联医学》、俄文《时代》杂志、英文《每日战讯》等刊物和中、俄、英、德、日文书籍三百六十五种，共发行二百十八万册以上。这些书刊在向中国人民介绍苏联与苏联文艺作品等方面有很大成绩。（新华社）
