Implementing Intensive Cultivation and Strengthening Technical Management
Zhang Junqi, Labor Model in the Suburbs of Shijiazhuang
Experimental Cotton Fields Yield 800 Jin of Seed Cotton per Mu

Zhang Junqi, an agricultural labor model from Liuying Village in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, practices intensive cultivation and pays attention to cotton planting techniques. This year, his cotton fields designated for high-yield experiments are expected to produce 800 jin of seed cotton per mu. Zhang Junqi planted a total of six mu of cotton this year, with one and a half mu in cooperation with the Hebei Provincial Farm as high-yield experimental cotton fields. The cotton plants are growing exceptionally lushly, ranking among the best in the 50,000 mu of cotton fields in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City. Each plant has an average of eighty flower buds, with more than forty cotton bolls expected to be retained. Based on one thousand six hundred plants per mu, if there are no unexpected disasters, each mu is expected to yield 800 jin of seed cotton. The remaining cotton fields are estimated to yield 500 jin of seed cotton per mu.

In 1950, Zhang Junqi attended the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Conference, where he learned many valuable experiences in cotton planting and pest control from labor models from various regions. This year, he actively responded to the government's call to plant cotton, planting six mu of cotton on his seven mu and two fen of cultivated land, and encouraged the entire village to plant cotton on more than 50% of all cultivated land. With the specific assistance of technical cadres from the Hebei Farm, Zhang Junqi implemented intensive cultivation and strengthened technical management: all cotton seeds used were the Si Zi No. 2 high-quality cotton variety, and after grain selection, the purity reached over 95%. The seeds were treated with boiling water before sowing. The cotton fields were plowed and harrowed twice in the autumn, and deep plowed twice this spring (to a depth of five cun). The high-yield experimental cotton fields were fertilized with two large carts of grass fertilizer, 220 jin of cottonseed cake, 50 jin of bone meal, and 20 jin of wood ash per mu. When the seedlings were five cun high, 12 jin of ammonium sulfate fertilizer were applied per mu; and another 12 jin were applied during the peak flowering and boll-forming period. The other cotton fields received one-fifth less base fertilizer per mu than the high-yield experimental cotton fields. Early thinning and late fixing of seedlings were implemented. Aphids were treated immediately when discovered at the seedling height of three cun. By the end of July, seven rounds of pest control had been carried out, completely eliminating insect pests. In terms of managing the cotton plants, timely pruning and removal of side branches were done, and fruit branches and top shoots were rationally removed.

The Central Ministry of Agriculture and the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry have paid attention to Zhang Junqi's cotton fields. Farmers from nearby villages are also constantly visiting to learn. Zhang Junqi has become a banner for improving agricultural production technology in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang.

　　实行精耕细作·加强技术管理
    石家庄市郊区劳动模范张君琦   
    试验棉田每亩可产籽棉八百斤
    河北省石家庄市郊区留营村农业劳动模范张君琦实行精耕细作，讲求植棉技术，今年作为丰产试验的棉田，每亩可产籽棉八百斤。张君琦今年共种棉六亩，其中一亩半与河北省农场合作，作为丰产试验棉田。现在棉株的生长特别茂盛，在石家庄市郊五万亩棉田中数头一份。平均每株已出花蕾八十个，可留棉桃四十多个。按每亩一千六百株计算，如无意外灾害，每亩可摘籽棉八百斤。其余棉田估计每亩亦可摘籽棉五百斤。
    张君琦在一九五零年曾出席河北省农业劳动模范会议，在会上向各地劳动模范学习到许多植棉与除虫的宝贵经验。今年积极响应政府的植棉号召，在自己的七亩二分耕地中种了六亩棉花，并带动全村种棉达全部耕地百分之五十以上。在河北农场技术干部的具体帮助下，张君琦实行精耕细作，加强技术管理：棉种全部采用斯字二比棉良种，并经过全部粒选，纯度达百分之九十五以上。播种前用开水烫种。棉地去秋耕、耙各两遍，今春深耕两遍（深度五寸）。丰产试验棉田每亩施草肥两大车，棉籽饼二百二十斤，骨粉五十斤，草木灰二十斤。苗高五寸时每亩施硫酸铔肥料十二斤；在开花铃盛时又施十二斤。其他棉田较丰产试验棉田每亩少施基肥五分之一。实行早间苗、晚定苗。苗高三寸时发现蚜虫立即开始除治，到七月底共除虫七遍，虫害全部消灭。在整理棉花方面做到及时整枝打杈，合理地折去果枝和群尖。
    中央农业部和河北省农林厅对于张君琦的棉田已予重视。附近各村农民也不断前往参观。张君琦已成为石家庄郊区改进农业生产技术的一面旗帜。
