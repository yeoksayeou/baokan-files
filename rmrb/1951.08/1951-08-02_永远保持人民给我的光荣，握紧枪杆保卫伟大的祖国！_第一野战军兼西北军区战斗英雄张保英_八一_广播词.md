Comrades!
　　Today, commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day, I feel very happy. Our People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, has grown from small to large, from weak to strong in the past twenty-four years. Today we not only have a strong army, but also a strong navy and air force. I myself have also been transformed from an ordinary farmer into a combat hero thanks to the patient education and training of superiors, the Party, and military leaders. I am from Wushan, Gansu. Since I was a child, I herded cattle and worked as a hired laborer for landlords, and was often beaten and abused. In 1943, the Kuomintang killed my grandfather and conscripted me. I didn't escape from that hell until 1946 when I joined the People's Liberation Army. Under the education of the Party, I realized that imperialism, feudalism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries are the deadly enemies of our people. If the people want to liberate themselves, they must eliminate these bad seeds. During the Liberation War, I participated in sixty-two battles, was awarded one special merit, three major merits, and five minor merits. I fought the enemy five times with bayonets, killing twenty-five enemies, and capturing more than one hundred prisoners. I eliminated more than three hundred enemies in total. I was also wounded seven times, with twenty-six holes in my body, a disabled left arm, four broken ribs, a piece of my tongue was shot off, and two teeth were knocked out. I feel very honored by all of this. After the four ribs were broken, people called me the "Broken Bone Hero". I said: As long as I live, as long as I can hold a gun, I will always be a soldier of the people.

　　Whenever people see me, they want me to describe the story of fighting the enemy with bayonets at Gouwa Mountain in Lanzhou. That time, I used a long spear to break into the enemy's position and killed nine enemies in a row, defeating the frantic counterattack of Ma Bufang's bandit army. Where did I get the long spear? It was in the spring of 1949 when I bought a six or seven-foot-long pole in Daguan, and nailed a sharp No. 65 bayonet on it. I thought, if I encountered Ma's bandits, their sabers would never be able to withstand this long and sharp spear. This was my experience from several battles with Ma's bandits. When the troops were marching towards Lanzhou, I made sure to practice bayonet fighting whenever I had time. Because the pole was long, some comrades thought it was too cumbersome and inconvenient. I explained to them: "Don't be afraid of the length, as long as it's effective, this will let Ma's bandits taste its power." At dawn on August 24th, after I led a platoon to defeat the enemy's five counterattacks on Gouwa Mountain, the cunning enemy attempted to outflank us and surround us. I led the second squad to immediately counterattack and pushed the enemy back again. At the same time, I held a long spear and chased after them. As soon as one bandit turned around, I stabbed him in the leg, and with another blow, the guy was finished. Then I stabbed two enemies in front. At that tense moment, Company Commander Wang of the Second Company ran over and said to me: "Zhang Baoying! The enemy is coming to die! Quick, fight!" I quickly took a look, and sure enough, six bandits, holding sabers, rushed straight over with bright flashes. Seeing the enemy's fierce attack, I first took out a grenade and threw it over. While the smoke and dust were blowing, Company Commander Wang and I pounced on them. He used his saber to slash, and I used my spear to stab, killing the enemy in a chaotic mess. One enemy took advantage of an opening and slashed at me. I turned around and knocked him to the ground, then in one stride stabbed the enemy to death. I looked up and saw that a trembling bandit had also had his arm chopped off by Company Commander Wang, screaming loudly. The remaining four bandits, seeing the situation was not good, turned around and ran away. We all chased after them and stabbed all the sons of bitches to death there. At this time, I was full of courage and rushed forward with all my might, wishing I could kill all the enemies with one shot. Suddenly, I found six or seven enemies in front of me. They set up a light machine gun and fired at me. I got anxious, grabbed a clod of dirt and threw it over. The sneaky enemies thought it was a grenade and were so scared that they all ducked down. I took the opportunity to pull out a real grenade and threw it over. These enemies thought it was just a clod of dirt, and didn't hide. With a "boom", the enemy was either killed or ran away. I went up and saw only one terrified bandit soldier, and ended his life with one bayonet. The enemy on the right front saw our fierce momentum and wanted to stop our army from charging, but they were already terrified and cowered. I bent down and picked up the enemy's abandoned grenade and threw it over, and I saw three enemies fall down. Then our army chased and killed them, and the battle was temporarily stopped. At noon the next day, our army launched a general attack on Lower Gouwa Mountain. This time I led a platoon and two sapper squads. In one morning, we successively captured two positions and stabbed two enemies to death with spears. At this time, my mouth, legs, and right arm were seriously injured, and blood soaked my clothes. But the enemy was still struggling to death. At this time, I used my left hand to swing up my pistol and continued to shoot at the enemy, and finally repelled the enemy's counterattack for the last time. Later, my comrades carried me off the front line.

　　This was my seventh injury. Before that, I had also fought with Ma's bandits. In June 1947, Ma's bandits invaded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Once, it was raining heavily, and the troops walked dozens of miles in the dark. After arriving at Mazizhang in eastern Gansu, I and the second platoon leader were on guard. We used grenades to drive away Ma's bandit cavalry that had emerged from the forest. We persisted for more than twenty minutes, allowing the troops to calmly deploy and control the favorable terrain. At daybreak, Ma's bandits dismounted and outflanked from the forest on the flanks. The second platoon leader and I each took one side to meet the enemy. When the grenades were used up, and we hadn't had time to reload our rifles, the enemy's saber came slashing over. I used the butt of my gun to deflect the saber, and followed up with a thrust. "Puchi", the four-sided Mosin–Nagant bayonet pierced from the enemy's chest to his back. The other bandits were terrified and wanted to run away. Taking advantage of the enemy's confusion, I went up and knocked down three more of them.

　　After the liberation of Lanzhou, the comrades elected me as a special-class combat hero. I felt that this was the glory given to me by the Party and the people.

　　Last year, the National Congress of Combat Heroes and Model Workers was held in Beijing, and I also went to participate. I received warm hospitality from people from all walks of life, and care and condolences from the central leaders. I felt both happy and ashamed. I only regretted that I had done too little for the people. At that time, I decided to learn from the brother field armies, exchange combat experience, and firmly remember the instructions of the leaders, and come back to do a better job to repay the people. At the meeting, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu gave us speeches. It was the first time I had ever seen Chairman Mao! How could people not be happy? They looked so young and healthy. We listened to them quietly. They said that the entire mainland had been completely liberated, but the US imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, would not be reconciled to their defeat, and would be ready to undermine our people's country at all times. Therefore, we must build a strong national defense force and turn our country into a richer and stronger country. And they called on us to fully prepare to strike at any enemy who dares to invade our country. Chairman Mao also taught us combat heroes not to be arrogant and complacent, but to humbly unite with the masses. Only by closely uniting with the masses can we progress more quickly. Combat heroes must not only unite with the masses, but also play three major roles in various tasks: leading, backbone, and bridge. I will never forget these valuable instructions in my life.

　　As soon as I returned from Beijing, I immediately did what Chairman Mao said. In addition to conveying the situation of the conference to the troops, I started with myself. In terms of learning culture, I overcame the past "impatient, can't remember" wrong ideas, and realized that learning culture is one of the important tasks for building a strong national defense army. With culture, we can better learn military science knowledge, master modern weapons, and improve combat effectiveness. So during the conveying to the troops, I carried a fountain pen, pencil, Chinese textbook, a small ink box, and a brush, and studied whenever I had time. And I told my comrades about the benefits of learning culture, and my determination to study. After the conveying was completed, I returned to the crash school. Because I went to Beijing for the conference, I was delayed for several months, and missed classes. I was determined not to take a nap and make up for my lessons. In the past five months, I have learned eight or nine hundred characters, and I can also write simple drafts and diaries. I also learned addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division mixed calculations. But I am not satisfied with this little achievement, and I want to continue to work hard to improve my cultural level. In terms of military training, I also formulated a training plan, determined to improve my skills in training. In terms of bayonet fighting, I want to advance straight thrusts to six hundred to seven hundred times, and I must also hit the target at twenty meters in flying thrust shooting. I want to throw a one-and-a-quarter-pound grenade thirty meters away. And I want to treat the playground as a battlefield, be serious and conscientious, abide by discipline, not miss training, teach the comrades what I know, and learn from everyone what I don't know. After this plan was formulated, I also challenged the entire army. Soon, commanders and fighters from various units, from joint teams to squads, platoons, and companies, discussed my training determination and plan, enthusiastically responded to the challenge, and launched a training competition upsurge in the troops. Although I am studying at the crash school, I never relax training for a moment. Because I know that the purpose of learning culture is to better improve military skills. So at school, I get up before dawn to practice bayonet fighting. Another combat hero, Tian Zhande, and I practiced bayonet fighting together with real guns; I thrust, he parried; he thrust, I defended. This also has difficulties. Because of excessive blood loss, I am weak, and lying in bed at night, my arms hurt so much that I can't move, and I am very sleepy. But I think it is not pain, but glory. I have the confidence and determination to complete my training plan.

　　After I returned from Beijing, I gave reports to the troops, local governments, and people from all walks of life. A total of more than twenty units participated, no less than five or six thousand people. In the report, I talked about what I saw and heard in Beijing, and also introduced my personal combat stories. During the report, the applause and slogans from the audience were like thunder, and everyone cheered for the great motherland, for the health of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and for their own emancipation, liberation, and the eternal happiness of their children and grandchildren. They recalled the past bitter days, and many people said: "Without the People's Liberation Army shedding blood and sweat, how could we have today? This is all thanks to Chairman Mao and the Liberation Army." The slogans below the stage were shouted: "Defend the fruits of victory, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship!" "Resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries!" "Support the People's Liberation Army!" The entire venue was sensational. After listening to the report, everyone was determined to increase production to support the People's Liberation Army; and to treat the families of martyrs and soldiers well. Many young people asked to join the army to strengthen the people's armed forces and defend the motherland. A farmer in Wushan County said: "In the past, when the 'Central Army' was here, we couldn't pay off the grain and money. We were beaten and abused at every turn. The people had enough. Now the People's Government is implementing rent reduction and interest reduction, and carrying out land reform, and the people's lives are more secure." Although he was about fifty years old, he automatically helped the military families in his village with planting and harvesting during the busy farming season. On "May Day", an old woman in Wushan County asked a young man to help her from the countryside to the city to participate in the conference. She felt that she was living a more and more meaningful life, and personally made a tobacco pouch with flowers embroidered on it, and asked someone to take it to Korea and send it to the Chinese People's Volunteers. She said: "We want to support the army and defend our good life." In Wushan County alone, more than two thousand farmers and students asked to join the army. I reported for four days in Weiyuan County, and four hundred young people there also automatically signed up to join the army.

　　Generally speaking, this report not only encouraged the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, but also educated myself. It has been less than two years since the liberation of Longnan, and the people's political consciousness has improved so much! I want to learn their patriotism.

　　Comrades! Now the United States has been forced to negotiate an armistice with us, but on the other hand, it is actively arming Japan and continuing to occupy our Taiwan. They want to prop up Japanese fascism and re-invade the Chinese people. Comrades! We must not relax our fighting will because of the Korean armistice negotiations. Taiwan is our own, and we must take it back. We resisted Japan for eight years, endured suffering, and sacrificed blood to make Japan surrender. Today, we resolutely oppose US imperialism's rearming of it, and we cannot let the Japanese devils invade us again. Now, only if we wipe our guns clean, sharpen our knives, master military skills, strengthen our fighting will, and be ready to eliminate any enemy who dares to invade our motherland at any time, can we ensure the safety of the motherland and world peace.

　　永远保持人民给我的光荣，握紧枪杆保卫伟大的祖国！
    ——第一野战军兼西北军区战斗英雄张保英“八一”广播词
    亲爱的同志们！
    今天，纪念“八一”建军节，我感到非常高兴。我们人民解放军，二十四年来在毛主席、朱总司令领导下，由小到大，由弱到强。今天我们不但有强大的陆军，而且也有强大的海军和空军了。我自己也同样由于上级、党和部队首长耐心的教育培养，由一个普通的农民，变成了战斗英雄。我是甘肃武山人，从小就给地主放牛，扛长工，挨打受气。一九四三年那年，国民党打死了我爷爷，抓壮丁时把我抓去了，直到一九四六年才出了火坑，参加了人民解放军。在党的教育下，我认识了帝国主义、封建主义、国民党反动派是咱们人民的死对头。人民要翻身解放，就非消灭这些个坏种不可。在解放战争中，我参加了六十二次战斗，立过一次特功、三次大功和五次小功。和敌人拚过五次刺刀，刺死二十五个敌人，捉了一百多个俘虏，在我手里一共消灭敌人三百名以上。我也受了七次伤，身上穿了二十六个窟窿，左胳膊残废了，四根肋骨打断了，舌头打掉一块子，还叫打落两颗牙齿。所有这些，我都觉得非常光荣。那次四根肋骨打断以后，人们都叫我“断骨英雄”，我说：只要我活着，只要能拿枪，我就永远是个人民的战士。
    别人一见我，就要我把兰州狗娃山和敌人拚刺的经过，介绍给他们听。那回我用一根长矛，闯入敌人阵地，一连刺死九个敌人，打垮了马步芳匪军的疯狂反扑。我那里来的长矛呢？还是一九四九年春天，我在大关中买了六、七尺长的杆子，把一根很快的六五刺刀钉装在上面，我想，这下碰见马匪，他的马刀，万抵不住这根又长又利的矛子。这是我几次和马匪作战得来的经验。当部队向兰州进军的路上，一有空我就抓紧练刺杀。因为杆子长，有的同志认为太累赘，不方便；我向他们解释说：“不要怕长，只要得力，这个管叫马匪尝尝它的厉害。”八月二十四日拂晓，我带一个排，在狗娃山打垮敌人五次反扑之后，狡猾的敌人企图迂回到我们后面，包围住我们。我率领二班马上反冲锋，又把敌人压下去。同时，我手持长矛，跟屁骨追上去。一个匪刚一回头，一矛子就刺在他腿上，又还了下手，那家伙就完蛋了。接着我又戳死前面的两个敌人。正紧张时，二连王连长跑来对我说：“张保英！敌人送死来啦！快打！”我连忙一看，果然六个匪徒，手持马刀，明晃晃地直冲过来。我见敌人来势凶猛，先掏出手榴弹打了过去，我和王连长趁着一阵烟尘，扑了上去。他用刀砍，我用矛子戳，把敌人杀得个乱七八糟。一个敌人趁空子向我砍来，我一转身把他打倒在地，一个箭步上去，把敌人刺死。我抬头一看，正在哆嗦的匪徒，也叫王连长一刀砍断了胳膊，哇哇地叫着。剩下那四个匪徒，见势不好，拔脚就跑。我们一齐追上去，全部把狗日的刺死在那里。这时，我浑身是胆，一股劲往前冲，恨不得一枪刺死所有的敌人。忽然发现前面有六七个敌人；他们架起一挺轻机枪，向我开火。我急了，顺手抓了个土圪塔扔过去，鬼头鬼脑的敌人，以为扔的是手榴弹，吓得都爬下了。我乘空子拔出真手榴弹打过去。这个敌人又以为是土圪塔，都没隐蔽。“轰隆”一声，把敌人打得死的死，跑的跑了。我上去只见一个吓呆的匪兵，一刺刀就结束了他的性命。右前方的敌人见我们气势凶凶，想阻挡住我军冲杀，但是他们已经吓破了胆，一个个畏缩不前。我弯腰拾起敌人遗弃的手榴弹打了过去，眼见三个敌人倒了下去。随后我军追杀上来，才暂时停止战斗。第二天中午，我军又向下狗娃山发起总攻，这回我带一个排和两个工兵班。一上午就接连夺下两个阵地，又用矛戳死两个敌人。这时我的嘴上、腿上、右胳膊上都带了重伤，鲜血渗透了衣服。但是敌人还在做垂死的挣扎。这会我用左手抡起手枪，继续向敌人射击，最后一次打退了敌人的反扑。以后同志们才把我背下火线。
    这已经是我第七次受伤了。在这以前我也曾和马匪拚过。一九四七年六月马匪窜扰陕甘宁边区。有一次天下大雨，部队摸黑走了几十里路，到陇东麻子掌后，我和二排长担任警戒。我们曾用手榴弹，打跑了从梢林中窜出来的马匪骑兵。我们坚持了二十多分钟，使部队从容布置好，控制了有利地形。天麻麻亮，马匪从马上下来，徒步从侧翼的林子里迂回过来，我和二排长两人各当一面，迎击敌人。手榴弹打光了，步枪也还没顾上装子弹的时候，敌人的马刀砍过来了。我用枪把刀一拨，跟上去一个突刺“噗嗤”，四楞子的水连珠刺刀，从敌人前心穿到后心。其他的匪军可吓坏了，回头就想跑。我趁着敌人混乱的当儿，上去又放倒他们三个。
    兰州解放以后，同志们评选我为特等战斗英雄。我觉得这是党和人民给我的光荣。
    去年，北京召开全国战斗英雄、劳动模范代表会议，我也去参加了。受到各界人民的热烈招待，和中央各首长的关心、慰问。我感到又是高兴，又是惭愧。只恨自己为人民出的力太小了。那时，我决心要向兄弟野战军学习，交流作战经验，并要把首长的指示牢牢记下，回来把工作做得更好，报答人民。会上，毛主席和朱总司令给我们讲了话。我还是第一次见到毛主席咧！你说怎能叫人不高兴？他们显得那么年青，身体健康。我们悄悄地听他们讲话。他们说全国大陆完全解放了，但是美帝国主义和它的走狗国民党反动派，还不会甘心他们的失败，还时刻准备破坏我们人民的国家。所以我们要建设强大的国防力量，把我国变成更富更强的国家。并号召我们充分准备，打击任何敢于侵犯我国的敌人。毛主席还教导我们战斗英雄们，不要骄傲自满，要虚心团结群众，只有紧紧和群众一道，我们才能更快进步。战斗英雄们不光要团结群众，还要在各种工作中起带头、骨干、桥梁三大作用。我一辈子也忘不了这些宝贵的指示。
    我从北京一回来，就马上照毛主席的话做去。除了把大会的情况传达给部队外，首先从我本身做起。学文化方面，我克服了过去“性子急，记不下”的错误想法，认识到学文化是建设强大国防军的重要工作之一。有了文化才能更好的学习军事科学知识，掌握现代化武器，提高战斗力。所以在给部队传达期间，我随身都带上钢笔、铅笔、国文课本，还有一个小墨盒和一支毛笔，得空就学。并向同志们讲学文化的好处，和我的学习决心。传达完毕，我仍回到速成中学。因为去北京开会，前后耽误了几个月，旷下了课。我下决心不睡午觉，补习功课。五个月来，我已经学会了八、九百个生字，还能写简单的稿子和日记了。算术也学会加减乘除混合演算。但是我还不以这一点成绩为满足，我更要继续努力，提高我的文化水平。军事练兵方面，我也订出了练兵计划，决心在练兵中把技术提高一步。刺杀方面，要前进直刺到六百至七百下，飞刺射击也要做到二十米目标命中。斤二两重的手榴弹要投三十米远。并且要把操场当做战场，严肃认真，遵守纪律，不缺操课，把我懂得的教给同志们，不懂的就向大家学习。这个计划订出来以后，还向全军提出挑战。不久，各单位指战员，从联手小组到班、排、连纷纷讨论了我的练兵决心和计划，热烈应战，掀起了部队练兵竞赛热潮。我自己虽然在速成中学学习，但我一时一刻也不放松练兵。因为我知道，学文化的目的是为了更好的提高军事技术。所以在学校里，天不明我就起床练刺杀。我和另一位战斗英雄田占德一块儿，用真枪，练对刺；我刺，他拨；他刺，我防。这样也有困难。因为流血过多，体力弱，晚上睡在床上，胳膊痛得不能动，浑身困得不行。但我认为不是痛苦，而是光荣。我有信心和决心完成我的练兵计划。
    我从北京回来以后，就给部队、地方政府、和各界人民传达报告。参加的一共有二十多个单位，不下五六万人。报告中，我讲了在北京的所见所闻，另外还介绍了我亲身经历的战斗故事。报告时，台下的鼓掌声、口号声简直像打雷一样，大伙儿为伟大的祖国欢呼，为毛主席、朱总司令的健康欢呼，为自己的翻身、解放和子孙后代的永远幸福欢呼。他们回忆了过去辛酸的日子，很多人都说：“没有人民解放军这样流血流汗，咱那能有今天？这全是毛主席和解放军的功劳。”台下面的口号喊起来了：“保卫胜利果实，巩固人民民主专政！”“坚决镇压反革命分子！”“拥护人民解放军！”整个会场轰动起来了。听了报告以后，大家决心增加生产，支援人民解放军；并要优待烈、军家属。很多青年要求参加部队，壮大人民的武装力量，保卫祖国。武山县一个农民说：“往年‘中央军’在，粮食、款出不完。动不动就挨打受气，老百姓受够了。现在人民政府实行减租减息，还进行土地改革，人民生活更有了保障。”他虽然已是五十岁左右的人了，但在农忙时，还自动帮助本村的军属种地、收庄稼。“五一”劳动节，武山县一个老太婆叫年青人搀着她，从乡下到城里去参加大会。她觉得现在越活越有意义，亲手做了个烟荷包，上面还绣着花，叫人捎到朝鲜，送给人民志愿军。她说：“我们要拥护军队，保卫咱这好日子。”只武山一县，就有两千多农民、学生要求参加部队。在渭源县报告了四天，那里也有四百名青年自动报名参加部队。
    总的说来，这次报告，不但鼓舞了群众的爱国热情，同时也教育了我自己。陇南解放还不到两年工夫，人民的政治觉悟已如此提高！我要学习他们的爱国精神。
    同志们！现在美国被迫和我们谈判停战，但另一方面又在积极武装日本，继续霸占我国的台湾。他们想把日本法西斯扶起来，重新侵略中国人民。同志们！我们决不能因为朝鲜的停战谈判，松懈自己的战斗意志。台湾是我们自己的，我们一定要收回来。我们抗战八年，受尽苦难，流血牺牲，才把日本打得投了降。今天坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装它，不能让日本鬼子再来侵略我们。现在，只有我们把枪擦好，把刀磨亮，熟练军事技术，加强战斗意志，随时准备消灭任何敢于侵犯我们祖国的敌人，才能使祖国的安全与世界和平获得保障。
