The people in various parts of East China have begun to implement the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China. Significant achievements have been made in destroying the feudal marriage system, protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women, and establishing new marital relationships and new families.

In the past year or more, in areas where the publicity and education of the Marriage Law have been done well, the masses have a relatively correct understanding of the new marriage system of freedom of marriage and equal rights for men and women. A new atmosphere has emerged in families and society. For example, in Qushan Township, Rongcheng County, Shandong, 44 couples freely married in one year, and all of them achieved mutual respect and love, unity and mutual assistance, and labor production. Liu Xin'ai and Zhang Yanfeng in Tai'an Prefecture, Shandong, freely fell in love and registered their marriage in the district. Immediately after the wedding ceremony, they went down the slope to work together. The couple's relationship was very good after marriage. The masses said, "The new marriage is so good, it's neither a hardship nor a waste of money. Husband and wife are united and help each other to do a good job in production. Living such a good life, who would want to hang themselves?" According to incomplete statistics from 22 counties and 4 cities in Shandong, 12,129 couples registered their marriages with the government in the second half of last year. In the 7th district of Minhou, Fujian, 206 couples registered in three months. In Longjing Village, She County, southern Anhui, 18 couples registered on one day last September. Some of these marriages were obtained through struggle. For example, Lin Cuizhi's mother disliked her daughter's poor lover, but Cuizhi firmly said, "The new Marriage Law stipulates that as long as we both agree, it's fine."

In addition to young men and women freely marrying, many parents are also able to consult with their children about engagements. When Zhu Yiran's mother in the 10th district of Fei County, Shandong, found a husband's family for her daughter, the daughter disagreed. After the mother understood the Marriage Law, she automatically withdrew the engagement on behalf of her daughter. When Li Huaiying's parents in Li Dazhuang Village, Guoyang County, northern Anhui, wanted to arrange an engagement for her, they allowed her daughter to go to the man's house to understand the situation. After talking with the man, she learned that he was a progressive young man who was actively engaged in production, so she happily agreed to the engagement. At the same time, widows have also gained the freedom to remarry under the publicity, education, and protection of the Marriage Law.

Encouraged and protected by the Marriage Law, many oppressed women have risen up to fight against the feudal marriage system and demand freedom and liberation. According to incomplete statistics from the East China Ministry of Justice, there were a total of 40,567 marriage cases in the second half of 1950, ranking first among all civil cases in East China (there were a total of 24,758 marriage cases in the three months from January to March this year, an increase compared to the ratio in the second half of last year). The vast majority of marriage cases are divorce cases, and those filed by women account for more than 75% to 90%. The reasons for divorce are mostly arranged or forced marriages, bigamy, and unbearable abuse. With the correct handling and support of the local courts, these unreasonable marital relationships have brought happiness and liberation to the broad masses of men and women, especially women. Zhang Jidi, a child bride in She County, southern Anhui, filed for divorce. Her parents-in-law refused, saying, "The daughter-in-law was bought with money. I don't allow it, so she can't divorce." The court not only ruled for divorce according to law but also patiently educated the parents-in-law, clearing up the two old people's thinking. Huian County, Fujian, was known as a "feudal fortress" and strictly prohibited widows from remarrying. Last September, Lin Xiling, a widow from Liucuo Village, Tukeng Township, 9th district of the county, fell in love with Liu Ali from the same village. The villagers locked her up and beat her severely, not giving her food for three days and three nights. Later, under the personal control of the responsible comrades of the county and district Party and government, in-depth publicity and education work was carried out from Party and non-Party cadres to village cadres and the masses, criticizing feudal reactionary ideas. Finally, Xiling and Ali were officially married with the approval of the masses. The "feudal fortress" was destroyed, and a new marriage system was established. Under this in-depth publicity and education, 22 couples in the village have since freely registered their marriages. Laboring woman Liu Wannian said, "I have had three major turnarounds since liberation. First, I got land. Second, my three sons don't have to worry about being forcibly conscripted. Third, in the past, poor families couldn't find wives, but now with the Marriage Law, I don't have to worry about it."

The People's Courts in various places have gained some experience in handling marriage cases; some have adopted methods such as circuit trials, public trials, and collective mediation. On the one hand, they have dealt with disputes, and on the other hand, they have done publicity and education work to the masses, expanding the influence of the Marriage Law. In many areas, representatives of the Democratic Women's Federation are invited to sit on the jury when handling marriage cases, which is a great spiritual support for women. With the participation of the Women's Federation representatives, it is easier to deeply understand the case and solve it quickly and correctly. When a village cadre in the 1st district of Kunyu County, Shandong, requested a divorce, the Women's Federation representative learned after careful investigation that he was being incited by others. After patient mediation, the couple reconciled.

However, the process of implementing the Marriage Law is a process of ideological struggle against feudalism. Long-term feudal systems and ideological customs have been deeply left not only among the masses but also among some cadres. At the same time, due to heavy workload, there has not been enough time to engage in systematic work on abolishing the old marriage system and implementing the Marriage Law, especially publicity and education. Therefore, the implementation of the Marriage Law has been hindered in many ways, and there are many serious deviations in the work. Serious incidents such as obstructing freedom of marriage, being forced to commit suicide, and being abused to death still occur. In the first quarter of this year, the whole region accepted 3,915 criminal cases involving marriage issues, including 627 cases of obstructing freedom of marriage, 649 cases of buying and selling marriages and trafficking in people, and 418 cases of bigamy. Although some problems are individual, they are extremely serious events. Forced and arranged marriages against the will of the parties are still common. For example, the custom of taking child brides and bride kidnapping has not been eliminated in rural areas of southern Jiangsu. At the same time, there are also many cases of drowning infant girls. What is more common is the phenomenon of women committing suicide or being killed due to feudal marriage. According to statistics from the Shandong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, in the past year, 1,245 people in Shandong Province committed suicide due to involuntary marriage and domestic abuse. In the nine counties of Huaiyin Prefecture in northern Jiangsu, 119 women were forced to commit suicide or were beaten to death from May to August 1950. In Linquan County, Fuyang Prefecture, northern Anhui, 52 women were abused to death from January to September last year.

Because some cadres still have a strong feudal patriarchal ideology and do not study the spirit of the Marriage Law, they regard the Marriage Law as a "divorce law" or a "women's law," harboring doubts and resistance. They dare not publicize the Marriage Law, fearing that publicity will cause "social chaos." They believe that all divorces are illegitimate and immoral. Some judges in northern Anhui think that women who dress neatly are immoral when they come to file for divorce. Therefore, they show indifference to women who are suffering from unreasonable marriages, or deliberately delay and make things difficult, or even interfere with and suppress divorce and marriage. For example, Pan, a young woman from Cangshan County, Shandong, was a child bride to Qi Yu of Yangjiazhuang, 1st district of the county, at the age of seven. She has been abused by her mother-in-law and husband for more than ten years. In April this year, after hearing about the Marriage Law, Pan went to the district government four times to file for divorce. When the district government summoned Qi Yu four times, Chen Yongmao, the village branch secretary, and Liang Ruicheng, the village chief, deliberately lied that Qi Yu was not at home in order to delay and resist. When Pan had no results from the lawsuit and had to return to her husband's family, Qi Yu and his mother stripped her naked, hung her from the beams, and beat her to death with whips, iron wires, and awls. When neighbors heard the sound and went to rescue her, the village cadres stopped them, saying, "She deserves to be beaten. Who told her to get a divorce? You are not allowed to save her." Wang, 24, from Wangyingzhai, Zhangzhai Township, Songji District, Linquan County, northern Anhui, had been married for four years. Her husband was an idiot. After liberation, she repeatedly requested a divorce but was unsuccessful. She had escaped three times but failed. Last July, when she requested a divorce from the township government again, Li Jinding, the village chief of the village, held a villagers' meeting to "struggle" against her, saying that she was immoral. As a result, Wang was forced to hang herself that night. Yu Xianbang, deputy secretary of the Youth League branch in Pukou Village, Xiaoshun District, Jinhua, Zhejiang, and Teng Guifen, a probationary member of the Youth League, were in love and were preparing to propose marriage to their parents. On the evening of January 6 this year, after the two of them held a League meeting, they were chatting at Teng's house when they were caught by village cadres and militiamen and said to be "violating discipline." They held a meeting to ask the two of them to confess, which forced Teng Guifen to hang herself. Three women in Jinjiang, Fujian, went to the district government to request a solution to their marriage problems. No one paid attention to them after three visits, and two of the women committed suicide at home.

There is also a tendency to handle things hastily. A doctor from the Taian Central Hospital, Shandong, had a wife at home but had a relationship with another woman outside. When he returned home, he immediately went to the government to file for divorce. The government did not notify his wife and ruled for divorce. The doctor took the judgment home and still lived with his wife for a few nights, without mentioning the divorce. But when he returned to the hospital, he married another woman. Some cadres had a good relationship with their wives a month ago, but a month later, they filed for divorce due to a small incident. The court did not investigate or mediate and ruled for divorce. There were even cases where the judgment had just been delivered when the parties applied to withdraw the original lawsuit.

Although these serious situations have attracted the attention of the higher authorities in some areas, and the relevant perpetrators (including cadres) who have disregarded the new Marriage Law and caused death cases have been given legal sanctions, many places have not only failed to thoroughly inspect the implementation of the new Marriage Law, but also have not promptly dealt with the death cases that have already occurred. This seriously damages the government's prestige and the improvement of family life and social order, and affects the production and work of the broad masses of people due to marriage problems. It is hoped that all relevant parties will pay strict attention to this, conduct in-depth publicity and education work on the new Marriage Law (especially education for cadres), gradually change the social atmosphere, and earnestly implement the new Marriage Law.

　　华东一年来执行婚姻法的情况
    华东各地人民开始执行了中华人民共和国婚姻法，对摧毁封建婚姻制度，保护妇女正当利益，建立新的婚姻关系和新的家庭方面，已获得显著成绩。
    一年多以来，凡婚姻法的宣传教育作得较好的地区，群众对婚姻自由、男女权利平等的新婚姻制度都有了比较正确的认识，在家庭和社会上就呈现了一片新的气象。如山东荣成县九区?山乡一年中就有四十四对夫妇自由结婚，并且都做到了互敬互爱、团结互助、劳动生产。山东泰安专区刘新爱与张延峰自由恋爱到区里登记结婚，结婚礼刚举行过后，就一同下坡去生产，婚后夫妇感情非常好。群众都说：“新的婚姻真好，既不受罪，又不花钱，夫妻团结互助、搞好生产。过着这样美好的生活，还有谁要去上吊寻死？”据山东二十二个县和四个市的不完全统计，去年下半年到政府进行登记结婚的有一万二千一百二十九对，福建闽侯七区一个地区三个月中有二百零六对，皖南歙县龙井村去年九月一天中就有十八对。其中，也有经过斗争而获得的，如林翠芝母亲嫌女儿的爱人穷，可是翠芝坚决地说：“新婚姻法规定，只要我俩同意就行。”
    除了青年男女自由结婚外，许多父母也都能与子女商量订婚。山东费县十区朱义然母亲给女儿找了个婆家，女儿不合意，母亲懂得婚姻法后，就自动代退了婚。皖北涡阳县李大庄村李怀英，父母要替她订婚时，让女儿到男家去了解情况，和男的交谈后，知道男方是一个思想进步，积极生产的青年，就愉快地和他订了婚。同时，寡妇在婚姻法的宣传教育和保障下，也都获得了再婚自由。
    在婚姻法的鼓舞保障下，许多被压迫的妇女，都起来向封建婚姻制度进行斗争，要求自由和解放。据华东司法部不完全的统计，一九五○年下半年婚姻案件共有四万○五百六十七件，占全华东民事案的第一位（今年一——三月三个月中共有婚姻案件二万四千七百五十八件，比去年下半年的比例数又增多），而婚姻案件绝大多数是离婚案；并且由女方提出的占有百分之七十五到九十以上。离婚原因则又多是：包办买卖婚姻、重婚、不堪虐待等。这些不合理的婚姻关系，在各地法院正确的处理和支持下，使广大男女群众，特别是妇女群众获得了幸福和解放。皖南歙县童养媳张吉娣申诉离婚，公婆不肯，说：“媳妇是花钱买的，我不允许，就离不了。”法院不但依法判离，并耐心教育公婆，打通了二个老人的思想。福建惠安县素称“封建堡垒”，绝对禁止寡妇再嫁。去年九月该县九区涂坑乡刘厝村寡妇林西玲与同村刘阿礼恋爱，村民把她关起毒打，三天三夜不给吃。后经县区党、政负责同志亲自掌握，从党内外干部到乡村干部和群众，展开了深入的宣传教育工作，批评了封建反动思想，终于使西玲与阿礼在群众赞同下正式结了婚。摧毁了“封建堡垒”，建立了新的婚姻制度。在这一深入宣传教育下，该村先后就有二十二对男女自由登记结婚。劳动妇女刘万娘说：“解放后我得了三大翻身。第一，分得了土地；第二，我三个儿子不愁强抽壮丁；第三，以前家穷讨不到媳妇，现在有了婚姻法也不发愁了。”
    各地人民法院处理婚姻案件的工作中，取得了若干经验；有的采取巡回审判、公开审讯、集体调解等方式，一方面处理了纠纷，另一方面对群众做了宣传教育工作，扩大了婚姻法影响。许多地区在处理婚姻案件时请民主妇联代表陪审，这对妇女群众是很大的精神上的支持。由于妇联代表参加处理，更容易深入了解案情，迅速和正确的解决；山东昆嵛县一区有一个村干部要求离婚，妇联代表仔细了解后，知道是受了别人挑拨，经耐心调解，夫妇重又言归于好。
    但是，婚姻法贯彻实行过程，就是反封建的思想斗争过程。长期的封建制度和思想习俗，不但在群众中并且也在一部分干部中，还浓厚地遗留着；同时，由于工作繁重，对废除旧的婚姻制度和贯彻婚姻法，来不及从事系统的工作，特别是宣传教育还不够。因此，使婚姻法的执行贯彻受到许多阻碍，在工作中存着许多较严重的偏向。妨害婚姻自由、被逼自杀、被虐杀等严重事件尚续有发生。今年第一季全区受理婚姻问题刑事案达三九一五件，内妨害婚姻自由六二七件、买卖婚姻与贩卖人口六四九件，重婚四一八件。有些问题虽然是个别的，但却是异常严重的事件、违反自愿的强迫包办婚姻还很多，例如领童养媳和抢亲，在苏南农村至今风气未除，同时溺杀私婴的事也很多。至妇女因封建婚姻自杀和被杀的现象更不断发生。据山东省民主妇联统计，一年来山东省因婚姻不自主，受家庭虐待而自杀的就有一千二百四十五人，苏北淮阴专区九个县一九五○年五月到八月被逼自杀和被打死的妇女达一一九人，皖北阜阳专区临泉县去年一月到九月被虐待逼死的妇女有五十二人。
    由于某些干部还存在着较浓厚的封建宗法思想，不学习研究婚姻法的精神，所婚姻法看成是“离婚法”、“妇女法”，存着怀疑抗拒思想。不敢宣传婚姻法，怕宣传了引起“社会大乱”，对离婚统统认为不正当，不道德。皖北有些审判员看见穿得干净些的妇女来申诉离婚时，都认为不正经。因此，对因婚姻不合理而受痛苦的妇女，表示漠不关心，或故意拖延、为难，甚至干涉、压制离婚、结婚。如山东苍山县青年妇女潘氏，七岁时给该县一区杨家庄齐玉做童养媳，十几年来受婆婆丈夫虐待。今年四月间潘氏听到婚姻法后曾四次到区政府提出离婚，区政府四次传询齐玉时，村支书陈永茂、村长梁瑞诚却故意谎说齐玉不在家，以拖延抗拒。潘氏因控诉无结果不得已仍回婆家时，齐玉母子即将她剥光衣服吊在梁上，用皮鞭、铁丝、刀锥等刺打致死。邻居闻声去营救时村干部却阻止说：“该打，谁叫她去要离婚的，不准你们去救她。”皖北临泉县宋集区张砦乡王营砦王氏二十四岁，结婚四年。丈夫是个傻子。解放后数次要求离婚不得，曾私逃三次亦未成。去年七月又向乡政府要求离婚时，该村村长李金鼎竟开了村民大会“斗争”她，说她不正经。致当夜王氏被逼吊死。浙江金华孝顺区浦口村青年团副支部书记俞宪邦与候补团员滕桂芬恋爱，已准备向父母提出结婚。今年一月六日晚上，二人开过团的会议后，在滕家谈天，被村干部与民兵捉起来说是“违反纪律”，开大会要他二人坦白，致滕桂芬被逼吊死。福建晋江有三个妇女到区政府请求解决婚姻问题，连去三次无人过问，当即有二个妇女回家自杀。
    还有一种是草率处理的偏向。山东泰安中心医院医生，家中原有妻子，在外又与一女子发生关系，回家即到政府提出离婚，政府未通知他老婆就判决离婚。这位医生拿了判决书回家仍与妻子同居了几夜，也不提起离婚事，但回到医院即与另一女子结了婚。有的干部一月前与妻子感情很好，一月后偶因小故即提出离婚，法院竟不加了解和调解，即判决离婚，甚至有判决书刚送到，当事人又申请撤回原诉的。
    这些严重的情况，目前虽已引起某些地区上级机关的注意，对那些漠视新婚姻法因而酿成人命案件的有关人犯（包括干部在内），予以法律制裁，但很多地方不仅没有对新婚姻法执行情况加以彻底检查，即已造成的命案，亦仍未迅予处理。这严重的损害着政府的威信和对家庭生活、社会秩序的改进，使广大群众因婚姻问题而影响生产和工作，希望各有关方面加以严格的重视，深入新婚姻法的宣传教育工作（特别是对干部的教育），逐渐转移社会风气，认真贯彻和执行新婚姻法。（原载上海解放日报）
