　　Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch: According to the Indian News Service in New Delhi: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech in the Indian Parliament on the 27th, explaining the Indian government's opposition to the American draft peace treaty with Japan and its refusal to participate in the San Francisco conference. Nehru first pointed out: "The war against Japan ended six years ago. This was followed by a military occupation of Japan, which continues to this day. India, like other countries, is in favor of ending this unsatisfactory state of affairs and concluding it with a peace treaty." Nehru explained: The Indian government received the US-British draft peace treaty with Japan on July 20 this year. He said, "The Indian government fully sympathizes with the basic goal of ending the state of war with Japan as soon as possible and allowing Japan to join the society of free and sovereign nations," "The other goals of the peace treaty with Japan should be to ease the current tensions in the Far East and promote the peaceful resolution of issues affecting that region." Nehru pointed out: "In order to achieve these goals, the Indian government has paid attention to some of the clauses in the draft treaty and put forward certain suggestions." Nehru announced: "On August 12, 1951, the Indian government received the US government's reply to the Indian government's opinions. Some minor modifications were made to the original draft, but the main suggestions put forward by the Indian government were completely rejected. Therefore, after careful consideration, the Indian government has come to the conclusion that India should not sign the treaty or participate in the San Francisco conference."

　　印度总理尼赫鲁发表演说
    说明印度政府不参加旧金山会议理由
    【新华社二十八日讯】据印度新闻处新德里讯：印度总理尼赫鲁二十七日在印度议会中发表演说，说明印度政府反对美国对日和约草案和拒绝参加旧金山会议。尼赫鲁首先指出：“对日战争在六年前结束。接着对日本实行军事占领，直到如今。印度和其他国家一样，赞成终止这种不能令人满意的状态，用和约结束这种状态。”尼赫鲁说明：印度政府在今年七月二十日接到了美英对日和约草案。他说：“印度政府完全同情尽快结束对日战争状态、准许日本加入自由的主权国家社会的基本目标”，“对日和约的其他目标应为缓和目前远东的紧张状态和促成影响那个地区的问题的和平解决”。尼赫鲁指出：“为了达到这些目标，印度政府对和约草案中的一些条款曾加注意，并提出某些建议。”尼赫鲁宣布说：“一九五一年八月十二日，印度政府接到美国政府对印度政府的意见的答复。原来的草案有了一些小的修改，但是印度政府提出的主要建议，完全没有被采纳。因此，印度政府经过仔细考虑以后得到一个结论，就是印度不应当在和约上签字，也不应当参加旧金山会议。”
