　　Farmers in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province
    Launch Patriotic Cotton Protection Competition
    Farmers in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, are enthusiastically launching a patriotic cotton protection competition.

    The patriotic cotton protection competition in Xingping County began in mid-July. Communist Party members and model mutual aid team leaders Zhang Mingliang and Xu Jingzhang took the lead in proposing a patriotic cotton protection production competition to all mutual aid teams and cotton farmers in the county, and put forward four competition conditions: (1) Mobilize all men, women, old and young, inside and outside the team, to prevent and control cotton field diseases and insect pests, water the fields well, and top the plants to strive for a greater cotton harvest; (2) Implement individual plant selection for seed retention; (3) Sell or store all new cotton harvested, except for personal use, to the state; (4) Continue to strengthen patriotic ideological education. The competition challenge of Zhang Mingliang and others immediately received an enthusiastic response from cotton farmers and mutual aid teams throughout the county. As of now, 280 mutual aid teams across the county have formulated response plans, and more than 1,000 other mutual aid teams have joined the chain competition for patriotic cotton protection.

    When the competition began, cotton farmers from the participating mutual aid teams first concentrated their efforts on preventing and controlling cotton aphids and other pests, and put forward the slogans "Love the country, protect cotton," "One household not preventing, harms everyone, everyone not preventing, harms the country," implementing measures of treating each plant individually and joint prevention by each household. Within a week, they completely eradicated the pests in more than 73,000 mu of cotton fields. Now, the vast number of cotton farmers are stepping up their efforts to fertilize, top, and water the cotton fields.

    In order to deepen the competition, the Communist Party branches and mutual aid team leaders in each township of the county convened meetings of Party members and team members to thoroughly discuss how to ensure the full realization of all competition conditions.

　　陕西省兴平县农民
    开展爱国保棉竞赛
    陕西兴平县农民热烈展开爱国保棉竞赛运动。
    兴平县的爱国保棉竞赛运动是从七月中旬开始的。共产党员、模范互助组组长张明亮、许敬章等首先向全县互助组和棉农提出爱国保棉的生产竞赛，并提出了四项竞赛条件：（一）动员组内外男女老幼防治和扑灭棉田病虫害，浇好水，打好卡，争取多收棉花；（二）实行株选留种；（三）所收新花除自用外，全部卖给或存给国家；（四）继续加强爱国主义思想教育。张明亮等的竞赛挑战，立即得到全县棉农和互助组的热烈响应。截至目前为止，全县已有二百八十个互助组订出应战计划，另有一千多个互助组参加了爱国保棉的连环竞赛。
    当竞赛运动开始后，参加竞赛的各互助组的棉农，首先集中力量，防治棉蚜等害虫，并提出“爱国家，保棉花”、“一家不防，有害大家，大家不防，有害国家”的口号，实行了株株除治，家家联防的办法。在一周内，他们将七万三千余亩棉田的虫害全部扑灭干净。现在，广大棉农正加紧进行棉田追肥、打卡和浇水。
    为使竞赛运动深入开展，该县各乡中共支部及互助组长都召开了党员和组员的会议，深入讨论如何保证各项竞赛条件的全部实现。  （新华社）
