　　Night Party School Work in Various Parts of Northern Jiangsu
　　Su Ping
　　In the summer of 1950, Communist Party organizations in cities such as Yangzhou, Nantong, Taixing, and Yancheng in the Northern Jiangsu District began piloting night party schools to provide systematic education on basic Party knowledge or current affairs education to Party members. Soon after, Party organizations in Haian, Rugao, Taizhou, Xinghua, Shuyang, Yilin, Dongkan, and other places also successively established night party schools. Over the past year, night party schools in various parts of Northern Jiangsu have trained approximately five thousand Party members. Among them, night party schools in five counties, including Taipei, Binhai, Yancheng, Funing, and Sheyang, alone trained 3,226 Party members.
　　The people studying at the night party schools are generally of two types: one is mainly composed of branch committee members and group leaders, and some Party members are also absorbed to participate in the study, such as in the two sessions of Dongkan Town's night party school, more than 100 of the 150 students were branch committee members and other cadres. The other type is mainly composed of Party members, and some non-Party activists are also absorbed to participate, such as in Nantong's night party school, 17 of the 50 students were non-Party members, and in Yangzhou's night party school, 3 of the 61 students were also non-Party members.
　　The educational content of night party schools generally focuses on basic Party knowledge and current affairs education. Basic Party knowledge mainly covers the history of the Communist Party of China, the obligations and rights of Communist Party members, organization and system, as well as how to be a good Party member, how to follow the mass line, and how to do a good job in branch work. Current affairs mainly talk about resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. The teaching method is mainly lecturing.
　　The duration of each session of night party school varies; but generally, the courses consist of ten to twenty lessons. Those with one class per day last about half a month; those with one class every other day last one month; those with two classes per week last two months; and those with one class per week last three to four months.
　　After studying basic Party knowledge, many Party members consciously criticized their own erroneous understanding of the Party and established correct concepts. Before studying, many comrades were not clear about the nature of the Party, and some regarded the Party as a mass organization. However, after studying at the night party school, they clarified the nature and tasks of the Party; and criticized their own erroneous understanding of the Party and impure motives for joining the Party. The awareness of non-Party activists participating in the study has also improved, mainly reflected in the gradual correction of their understanding of the Party. They have realized that to apply for Party membership, they must study hard, do their job well, and create the conditions for a Communist Party member; and should not treat the Party with other erroneous attitudes. After current affairs education, both Party members and non-Party members have a more correct understanding of the current situation and have increased their confidence in resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. Before studying, some Party members in Dongkan Town did not understand the great significance of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and the relationship between Korea and our country. However, after studying, many comrades actively helped the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and other practical actions to resist America and aid Korea.
　　The study of the mass line has strengthened everyone's mass viewpoint. For example, several members of the Yangzhou Sauce Industry Trade Union, after studying the mass line, went deep into understanding the ideological situation of the workers and decided on work policies and steps. They have also managed to consult with the workers on matters and have changed the past practice of doing everything for them.
　　Finally, after studying at the night party school, everyone's enthusiasm and consciousness for learning have been improved. In the past, some Party members only knew how to work and did not know how to learn, and believed that it did not matter if they did not study well, but it was not acceptable if they did not do their job well; but after participating in the night party school, they changed this understanding and became interested in learning, realizing that learning is precisely for doing their job well. Someone said: "If you don't study, you are always confused, and can you not make mistakes in your work?! To do your job well, you must study."
　　Over the past year, the Northern Jiangsu District has explored the following experiences in piloting night party school work: First, it is clear that night party school is indeed a good organizational form for regularly educating Party members in cities. This is because on the one hand, it has a relatively formal teaching form; on the other hand, classes are held at night, which is spare time from work, and there is such a habit in the city. Secondly, to run a night party school well, it mainly depends on whether the Party committees at all levels attach importance to this work. The Yangzhou City Night Party School encountered many difficulties when it first opened, but because the Municipal Party Committee gave a lot of help to this work, such as personally undertaking night party school courses. In this way, the education plan of the night party school was successfully completed. Again, the educational content of the night party school should focus on basic Party knowledge, combined with current affairs education, and the education of certain relevant basic policies. Because now the average Party member knows very little about basic Party knowledge, if they are not given a systematic education on basic Party knowledge, they cannot improve the class consciousness of Party members and be a good Party member. In addition, the night party school should also organize classes according to the political and cultural level of the students; and the leaders should also promptly solve the learning and work difficulties of the students, etc.

### 苏北各地的夜党校工作

　　苏北各地的夜党校工作
    苏萍
    一九五○年夏季，苏北区的扬州、南通、泰兴、盐城等城市的共产党组织开始试办夜党校，对党员进行系统的党的基本知识教育或时事教育。不久，海安、如皋、泰州、兴化、沭阳、益林、东坎等地党组织，也都先后举办了夜党校。一年来苏北各地夜党校约训练了五千名党员。其中台北、滨海、盐城、阜宁、射阳等五个县的夜党校，即训练了党员三千二百二十六名。
    在夜党校学习的大致是这样两种人：一种是以支部委员与小组长为主，并吸收部分党员参加学习，如东坎镇两期夜党校的一百五十名学员中，支部委员等干部即有一百多名。另一种则是以党员为主，并吸收部分非党积极分子参加，如南通夜党校五十名学员中，即有非党员十七人，扬州夜党校六十一名学员中，亦有非党员三名。
    夜党校的教育内容，一般均以党的基本知识与时事教育为主。党的基本知识，主要是讲中国共产党的党史、共产党员的义务与权利、组织与制度，以及怎样做一个好党员、怎样走群众路线、怎样做好支部工作等。时事主要讲抗美援朝保家卫国。教学方法以上课为主。
    夜党校每期举办时间，长短不一；但一般课程都是十课到二十课，每日上课一次的，约半个月为一期；隔日上课一次的，一个月一期；每星期上课两次的，两个月一期；每星期上课一次的，三个月到四个月一期。
    许多党员经过党的基本知识的学习后，自觉地批判了自己对党的错误认识，树立起正确的观念。在学习前原来有不少同志对党的性质是不清楚的，有人把党当作群众性的组织。但是经过在夜党校学习后，弄清了党的性质与任务；并批判了自己对党的错误认识和不纯的入党动机。参加学习的非党积极分子的觉悟也提高了一步，主要表现在对党的认识逐渐正确，已认识到要求入党，就要努力学习，作好工作，创造一个共产党员的条件；而不应以其他的错误的态度来对待党。经过时事教育后，无论党员与非党员，对时局也都有了比较正确的认识，提高了抗美援朝保家卫国的信心。在学习前，东坎镇有些党员不了解抗美援朝保家卫国的重大意义，和朝鲜与我国的关系。但在学习后，许多同志都以积极帮助政府进行镇压反革命工作等实际行动来抗美援朝。
    群众路线的学习，加强了大家的群众观点。如扬州酱业工会的几个委员，在学习群众路线后，即深入了解工人群众的思想情况，决定工作方针、步骤。并已作到有事和工人群众商量，改变了过去包办代替的工作作风。
    最后，经过在夜党校学习后，提高了大家的学习积极性与自觉性。过去有些党员只知道做工作，不知道学习，并认为学不好不要紧，作不好工作不行；但参加了夜党校学习以后，改变了这种认识，对学习有了兴趣，认识了学习正是为了作好工作，有人就这样说：“不学习老是糊里糊涂，做工作还能不犯错误？！要作好工作就要学习。”
    苏北区在试办夜党校的工作上，一年来已摸索到以下数点经验：首先是明确了夜党校确是城市中对党员经常进行教育的一种良好的组织形式。这是因为它一方面具有比较正规的教学形式；另一方面夜间上课，是工作的空隙时间，在城市又有这样的习惯。其次要办好夜党校，主要决定于各级党委对这一工作的重视与否。扬州市夜党校，在刚开办时，曾遇到不少困难，但由于市委对这一工作给予很多的帮助，如亲自分担夜党校课程等。这样夜党校的教育计划得以顺利完成。再次夜党校教育内容，应该以党的基本知识为主，结合进行时事教育，和某些有关的基本政策的教育。因为现在一般党员对党的基本知识懂得很少，如果不很好对他们进行系统的党的基本知识的教育，就不能提高党员的阶级觉悟，作一个好党员。此外夜党校还应按学员的政治、文化程度编班；领导同志还应及时解决学员学习与工作上的困难等。
