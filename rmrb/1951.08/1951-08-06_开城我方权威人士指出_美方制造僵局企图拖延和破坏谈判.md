　　Kaesong Our authoritative source points out
    The US is creating a stalemate in an attempt to delay and undermine the negotiations.
    We eagerly desire peace, but we will never accept any unreasonable demands. The Chinese and Korean people know how to defend peace!
    [Our correspondent in Kaesong, August 5th] A document issued by the "Allied Headquarters" press office on July 31st, first announced by Agence France-Presse on July 31st and later published by the American and British news agencies on August 4th, stated: "Regarding the military demarcation line that we must agree on, it should be somewhere in the middle of the air and naval front on the Yalu River and the army front in the Kaesong, Pyongyang, and Imjin River areas." Our correspondent interviewed authoritative sources here about this matter. It was reported that the military demarcation line advocated by the US at the Kaesong meeting was indeed deep within our territory, north of the current line of confrontation on the 38th parallel, that is, starting from Seoam-ri, about 20 kilometers north of our current Hupho-ri front on the east coast, southwestward through Doyuswal, about 30 kilometers north of our current Pyongyang front, westward through Wolam-ri, about 20 kilometers north of our current Yeoncheon front, then across the Imjin River westward through the vicinity of Gimcheon, to the Ongjin Peninsula. In other words, the demilitarized zone proposed by the US is to be drawn from the area of the current positions of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and a portion of the area will also be designated as the US military's position after the armistice. In other words, the military demarcation line proposed by the US requires that in the east of the Imjin River, our side should withdraw an average of 30 to 40 kilometers from the current position, withdrawing a total of 3,000 to 4,000 square kilometers of land, as the opponent's position after the armistice and the demilitarized zone between the two sides. In the west of the Imjin River, it is necessary to withdraw about 2,000 to 3,000 square kilometers of land.
            The absurd proposition put forward by the US cannot be accepted by the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world.
    What reason does the US military, which is already in a difficult situation on the Korean battlefield, have to put forward such an absurd proposition? The US insists that the army, navy, and air force each have an independent battlefield. Since the US has an advantage in the navy and air force, and its navy and air force front is far on the Yalu River line, it should obtain compensation on the land battlefield at the time of the armistice; therefore, the military demarcation line should be drawn north of the 38th parallel and north of the current front line, deep into our territory. What is infuriating is that the US has actually used its violation of international law and humanitarianism, specializing in the slaughter of innocent Korean people and destroying Korean peaceful cities and villages by the brutal actions of the US air force and navy, as its "independent" "advantage" in the navy and air force, demanding that the land defended by the blood of the Chinese and Korean people be used to "compensate" when determining the military demarcation line. But in fact, without this kind of "cooperation" of the navy and air force, the US invading army would have long been annihilated somewhere by the heroic Korean and Chinese people's forces, and driven to somewhere; only by relying on this kind of "cooperation" of the navy and air force can the US ground forces temporarily, barely, and unstably maintain such a situation on the Korean battlefield where they are beaten everywhere and always being hit. Unexpectedly, they also came up with the argument of some "independent naval and air force advantage," isolating each service, separating the army, navy, and air force into separate battlefields, and boasting of brutality as strength. This is an absurd, arrogant, and ignorant proposition that the Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world can never accept.
    The US's absurd proposal completely fails to reflect the military reality on the battlefield at this stage and the comparison of military strength between the enemy and ourselves. According to the facts of the past seven months of this year, the enemy's northward advance has fallen into a snail's pace, with great difficulty, and our southward advance has always been like a broken bamboo, going straight down. In the seven months, the positions of both sides were not stable, and our army launched several active attacks, annihilating the enemy's living forces. Therefore, the current front line absolutely cannot reflect the military reality and absolutely cannot be used as the military demarcation line between the two sides, let alone going north of the current front line deep into our existing territory? The other side's so-called "military reality" is just a subjective ambition and delusion. Whether in theory or in fact, it is untenable.
    In order to support its difficult-to-defend proposal, it is reported that the US has also put forward another "reason," that is, the US needs a security guarantee for its troops during the armistice period and needs a defensible position. According to their "reason," only north of the 38th parallel, north of the current front line, in our territory, can they find a sufficient "defensive position." This kind of method, which is most skilled by the American imperialists, of using the name of "defense" to expand its power around the world, establish military bases, and prepare for aggressive wars, has actually been used on the Kaesong armistice conference table for seeking a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. This is outrageous! It is worth being vigilant that the US representative is not thinking about peace, but only emphasizing the side of the recurrence of war. In fact, as long as both sides are sincere, mutually agree, jointly abide by, and establish a demilitarized zone with the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, is there a better and more effective security guarantee for the troops of both sides than this? Without seeking sincere peace and a fair and reasonable demarcation line, but only planning to establish a "defensive position" on other people's territory, what is the reason? What is the motive? Please let the people of the world judge. To talk about defense, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has more right and necessity to demand the defense of its own country's land. But it is reported that our side has not proposed this in order to reach an armistice agreement as soon as possible. On the contrary, the US has clamored for the necessity of "defense," insisting that there is no "defense" south of the 38th parallel, and that the place where it can be "defended" is north of the 38th parallel. The US attempts to use the so-called purely military reason that its troops need a sufficient "defensive" position to defend itself to defend its absurd proposition. In fact, the US's political purpose of advancing the "defensive position" to north of the 38th parallel is well known. For a long time, the American imperialist aggressors have falsely accused the Chinese and Korean people who defend their motherland and the border of their motherland as "aggressors." Now, the specific proposition they have put forward is an attempt to confirm their shameful slander. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese and Korean people.
            Our delegation has sufficient reasons to propose the 38th parallel as the demarcation line.
    The delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers has put forward the establishment of a demilitarized zone by determining the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line in a realistic manner, which is fully justified:
    First, the 38th parallel appropriately reflects the military reality on the battlefield at this stage and the comparison of military strength between the two sides. For example, in the first seven months of this year, the line of contact between the two sides has swung over the 38th parallel four times, our side has entered south of the line twice, and the enemy has entered north of the line twice. Our troops stayed south of the line for a total of about five months, and the enemy troops stayed north of the line for a total of more than two months. One of the characteristics of the current front line is its instability; and another characteristic is that the scope of the changes always revolves around the 38th parallel. From the overall point of view, everyone knows that the strength of both sides on the Korean battlefield is currently in a state of equilibrium, although this state of equilibrium itself is not immutable due to the rapid growth of our strength. Therefore, only the 38th parallel is the line that most appropriately reflects the military reality at this stage.
    Second, the 38th parallel is fair and reasonable to both sides. For example, our side and the enemy each occupy a part of the 38th parallel. The length occupied by our side (about 145 kilometers) is roughly equal to the length occupied by the enemy (about 165 kilometers). The area of the area south of the 38th parallel currently occupied by our side (about 3,630 square kilometers) is limited from the area north of the line currently occupied by the enemy (about 4,630 square kilometers). If the 38th parallel is used as the military demarcation line and the two sides make adjustments, neither side will suffer any losses, which is the most fair and reasonable.
    Third, determining the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line is a universally recognized basis for stopping the Korean War and also the premise of this armistice negotiation, so it is conducive to the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Since the armistice negotiation is the first step in the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, when deciding on the military demarcation line, it should fully consider the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and should not only proceed from a purely military point of view. Our basic position is completely correct. Is this armistice for peace or for re-war? The other side's sophistry that "the 38th parallel is not a military demarcation line, but a territorial demarcation line, so it cannot be considered" is completely unfounded. The Chinese people firmly advocate using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line between the two sides. It was only when the US imperialists disregarded the opposition and warnings of the Chinese people, crossed the 38th parallel, approached the Yalu River, and threatened the security of the Chinese mainland, that the Chinese people rose up voluntarily to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Therefore, in order to reach an armistice, the 38th parallel must also be used as the military demarcation line between the two sides. World opinion has in fact already approved the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line between the two sides. Tracing back to the source of this armistice negotiation, it is based on Malik's proposal as the premise, and Malik publicly proposed using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line. The peace-loving people of the world still remember the question raised by Malik. Malik asked: Is it too high a price for the warring parties in Korea to exchange for peace at such a cost? Malik said it was not high. There is no doubt that the opinion of countries all over the world, including the United States, unanimously welcomed Malik's reply. It should be pointed out that even US Secretary of State Acheson himself has repeatedly acknowledged the rationality of using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line. As early as June 2nd, Acheson declared in the US Congress that "the United States may agree to a ceasefire on the 38th parallel"; and after Malik's proposal, on June 26th, Acheson clearly declared: "From a military point of view, a ceasefire on the 38th parallel is acceptable." Please note that Acheson specifically stated that this is a military point of view. Why are Ridgway and Joy's military views different from Acheson's? Why is Acheson himself now slapping himself in the face? It can be seen that the rhetoric against using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line is completely untenable and is only a strategy to deliberately create tension and stalemate in order to delay and undermine the negotiations. If both sides can be candid and make joint efforts to seek the realization of peace, the progress of the armistice conference should not be too difficult. But the American warmongers do not think the same as the peace-loving human beings in the world, so there are endless excuses for causing delays.
            The Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world must closely and solemnly watch the actions of the US.
    People who are concerned about the negotiations probably want to know the environment of the meeting. From the beginning of the negotiations to now, when the meeting is held every day, American warplanes often buzz over the meeting place. Near the meeting place, ten or twenty kilometers away, American naval artillery fire is almost daily. Provocative attacks by the US and Li forces on the entire battlefield are constantly occurring. The inhumane indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities and innocent residents in the rear by US aircraft has increased rather than decreased. This is the environment of the Kaesong negotiations. These kinds of behaviors outside the meeting by the US are showing that they are trying to create a tense war atmosphere outside the meeting to force our peace-loving side to make concessions. In order to cover up this provocative behavior, the other side has gone so far as to fabricate news saying that the two sides have reached a clear agreement at the meeting, believing that hostile actions should continue during the meeting. In fact, there is no such agreement at all. The purpose of the other side in saying this is obviously to cover up its arrogant and shameful attempt to force us to submit with indiscriminate bombing. But the eyes of the people of the world are discerning, and this kind of trickery cannot deceive or scare people. Since the beginning of the meeting, in order to reach an armistice agreement as soon as possible and realize the initial wishes of the peace-loving people of the world, our side has made concessions on the neutral zone and reporter interview issues proposed by the other side and the agenda issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea. This is a concrete manifestation of the willingness of the Chinese and Korean people to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, which is witnessed by the people of the world. But the American imperialists mistakenly believe that this is a sign of weakness on our part. The British and American news reports that reporters have seen in Kaesong these days have repeatedly confirmed that they are immersed in this illusion. The Chinese and Korean people should shout loudly to them: "You are wrong!" We eagerly desire peace, but we will never bow to your unreasonable demands. The Chinese and Korean people, who have been tempered in the anti-aggression struggle, know how to defend peace.
    In short, the problem now is very simple. Whether the US government is sincere in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, thereby agreeing to a fair and reasonable armistice agreement, all depends on the performance of the US in concrete actions inside and outside the meeting. The Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world cannot but closely and solemnly watch its development.

　　开城我方权威人士指出
    美方制造僵局企图拖延和破坏谈判
    我们热望和平，但我们绝不会接受任何无理要求。中朝人民是懂得怎样保卫和平的！
    【本报记者八月五日开城电】最早在七月三十一日由法新社宣布而后来又在八月四日由美英通讯社发表的“盟军总部”新闻处七月三十一日发表的一项文件，内称：“关于我们必须获得协议的军事分界线，应在鸭绿江上的空军及海军战线与开城、平康、临津江区域的陆军战线的中间某处。”记者特就此事访问此间权威人士。据告：美方在开城会议所主张的军事分界线，确是在三八线北双方目前对峙线以北的深入我方地区之内，即从东海岸我方现有阵地胡坡里前线以北约二十公里处之西峨里起，向西南经我方现有阵地平康前线以北约三十公里处之道修垡向西，再经我方现有涟川前线以北约二十公里处之月岩里，然后穿过临津江向西经过金川附近，以迄瓮津半岛。这就是说，美方提议的非军事区系从朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军现有阵地的地区内划出，并且另外还要另行划出一部分地区作休战后的美军阵地。换言之，即美方提出的军事分界线，要求在临津江以东我方应从现有阵地后撤平均三十至四十公里，共撤出三千至四千方公里土地，作为对方在休战后的阵地及双方阵地间的非军事地区，在临津江以西则须撤出约二千至三千方公里的土地。
            美方提出荒谬主张为中朝人民和全世界人民所不能接受
    在朝鲜战场已经焦头烂额的美军，凭什么理由提出这样荒谬的主张呢？美方硬说：陆海空军各有一个独立的战场，美方既占有海空军优势，其海空军前线远在鸭绿江一线，则在停战时自应在陆上战场取得补偿；因此，军事分界线应划在三八线北目前战线以北，深入在我方地区内。令人愤慨的是美方竟将其违反国际公法和人道主义，专事屠杀朝鲜无辜人民，毁坏朝鲜和平城市村镇的美国空军和海军的残暴行为，当作它的海空军的“独立”的“优势”，要求在确定军事分界线时，用朝中人民以鲜血保卫的土地去“补偿”。但事实上，如果没有海空军的这种“配合”，美国侵略军早已不知道被英勇的朝中人民部队消灭在那里，驱逐到那里了；仅仅靠着海空军的这种“配合”，美国地面部队才能在朝鲜战场暂时地、勉强地不稳定地维持这样一个处处挨打，时时被揍的局面。想不到他们还想出个什么“独立的海空军优势”这种孤立各兵种，分出陆海空军各别的战场，夸耀残暴为力量的论点，是荒谬绝伦，狂妄无知的主张，是中朝两国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民绝对不能接受的。
    美方的荒谬提案，完全不能反映现阶段战场上的军事实际和敌我双方的军力对比。根据今年过去七个月的事实，敌方北进陷入蜗行牛步，困难万分，我方南下则总是势如破竹、长趋直下。在七个月中，双方阵地并不稳定，我军迭次主动出击，消灭敌军有生力量。因此，目前战线绝对不能反映军事实际，绝对不能作为双方军事分界线，何况要在目前战线以北深入到我现有地区之内？对方所谓“军事现实”，只是主观的野心妄想而已。不论就理论或事实来说，都是站不住的。
    为了支持其难以自圆其说的提议，据悉，美方还提出了另一个“理由”，即是美方需要停战期间部队的安全保证，需要可资防御的阵地。而依照他们的“理由”，只有在三八线北，目前战线以北，在我方地区内，他们才找得着充分的“防御阵地”。这种假借“防御”之名，在全世界各地扩张势力，建立军事基地，准备侵略战争的那套美国帝国主义分子所最熟练的手法，竟被运用到为谋取朝鲜问题和平解决的开城停战会议席上，真是岂有此理！美方代表不从和平着想，而只是强调战争再发的一面，是值得警惕的。事实上，只要双方都有诚意，互相协议、共同遵守、以三八线为军事分界线并建立非军事地区，双方部队的安全保证还有比这个更好更有效的吗？不去寻求诚意的和平与公平合理的分界线，而一味在他人领土上打算建立“防御阵地”，这是什么道理？这是什么动机？请全世界人民评一评看。要说防御，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国更有权利和必要要求防御自己祖国的土地。但据悉，我方为了早日达成停战协议，并没有这样提。相反地，美方却叫嚣“防御”的必要，硬说三八线以南无可“防御”，其可以“防御”的地点却是在三八线以北。美方企图用部队需有足资“防御”的阵地以保卫其自己的这种所谓纯粹军事的理由，来为它的这个荒谬主张辩护。其实美方把“防御阵地”推进到三八线以北的政治目的，是司马昭之心路人皆知的。长时期以来，美国帝国主义侵略者就已诬蔑我保卫祖国和祖国边疆的中朝人民是“侵略者”，现在他们提出的这个具体主张，正是妄图证实他们那个可耻的诬蔑。而这是中朝两国人民所绝对不能容忍的。
            我方代表团提出以三八线为分界线有着充分的理由
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团，实事求是地提出了确定三八线为军事分界线以建立非军事区，是有充分理由的：
    第一，三八线适当地反映了现阶段中战场上的军事实际和双方的军力对比。例如：在今年最初七个月里，双方接触线在三八线上摇摆过四次，我方进入线南两次，敌方进入线北两次。我方部队停留线南共约五个月，敌方部队停留线北共约两个多月。目前战线的特点之一是它的变动不居；而其另一特点则是变动的范围始终围绕在三八线左右。从总的方面看，谁都知道目前在朝鲜战场双方的力量是处于平衡状态的，虽然由于我方力量的迅速生长，这种平衡状态本身并非是一成不变。因此，只有三八线才是最适当地反映现阶段军事实际的线。
    第二，三八线对双方都是公平合理的。例如：我方与敌方各占三八线一部分。我方所占长度（约一四五公里），与敌方所占长度（约一六五公里）也大致相等。我方现占三八线以南地区面积（约三六三零方公里）与敌方所占线北地区面积（约四六三零方公里）相差有限。如以三八线为军事分界线双方加以调整，彼此都没有什么吃亏，最为公平合理。
    第三，确定三八线为军事分界线，是举世公认的停止朝鲜战争的基础，也是此次停战谈判的前提，因此是有利于朝鲜问题的和平解决的。停战谈判既是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步，在决定军事分界线时，自应充分考虑到朝鲜问题的和平解决，而不能仅从单纯的军事观点出发。我方这个基本立场是完全正确的。难道此次停战不是为了和平，而是为了再战吗？对方硬说“三八线不是一条军事分界线，而是一条领土分界线，因此不能考虑”的诡辩，是完全没有根据的。中国人民坚决主张以三八线为双方军事分界线。中国人民是在美帝国主义不顾中国人民反对与警告，超过三八线，直迫鸭绿江，威胁中国大陆安全时，才起而志愿抗美援朝的。因此，为达成停战，也必须以三八线为双方军事分界线。全世界的舆论事实上早已批准了三八线为双方军事分界线。追溯这次停战谈判的来源是以马立克的建议为前提的，而马立克是公开提出以三八线为军事分界线的。全世界爱好和平的人民当还记得马立克提出的问题。马立克问：朝鲜交战双方用这样的代价去换取和平是不是太高呢？马立克说是不高的。毫无疑问，世界各国的舆论包括美国的舆论是一致欢迎马立克的答复的。应当指出，就连美国国务卿艾奇逊本人，也曾经再三承认以三八线为军事分界线的合理。还在六月二日，艾奇逊在美国国会就声明“美国可能同意在三八线上停火”；而在马立克的建议以后，在六月二十六日，艾奇逊又明确地声明：“从军事观点来看，在三八线停火是可以接受的。”请注意，艾奇逊特地声明这是军事观点。为什么李奇微、乔埃的军事观点和艾奇逊不同呢？为什么艾奇逊自己现在打自己的嘴巴呢？可见反对以三八线为军事分界线的一派胡言，是完全不能自圆其说的，只是一种故意制造紧张和僵局以拖延和破坏谈判的策略。如果双方能开诚相见，共同努力寻取和平的实现，停战会议的进行应当没有多大的困难。但是美国好战分子并不和世界上爱好和平的人类一样想，这样就出现了层出不穷的造成拖延的借口。
            中朝人民和世界人民必须密切严正注视美方行动
    关心谈判的人们大概愿意知道会议的环境。从谈判开始到现在，每天会议进行的时候，会场上空经常有美国作战飞机嗡嗡飞过。离会场一、二十公里附近，美国海军的炮击几乎每天都有。整个战场上美李军挑拨性的进攻经常不断。美机对后方和平城市与无辜居民的无人道的狂轰滥炸有增无减。这就是开城谈判的环境。美方在会外的这种种行为，正显示他们企图在会外造成紧张的战争气氛，压迫爱好和平的我方让步。为了掩饰这种挑衅行为，对方竟不惜捏造消息说双方在会议上曾经达成明确协议，认为在会议期间敌对行为应予继续，事实上根本就没有这种协议的存在。对方这样说的目的，显然是在掩盖其用狂轰滥炸以逼我就范的狂妄可耻的企图。但全世界人民的眼睛是雪亮的，这种鬼蜮伎俩是既骗不了人，也吓不了人的。会议开始以来，我方为了迅速达成停战协议，以实现世界爱好和平人民的初步愿望，曾在对方提出的中立区与记者采访问题及从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队的议程问题上作了让步。这是中朝人民愿意和平解决朝鲜问题的具体表现，是全世界人民有目共睹的。但美帝国主义者们却误认这是我方的示弱。记者这几天在开城看到的英美新闻报道一再证实了他们是沉浸在这种错觉中。中朝人民应该向他们大喝一声：“你们错了！”我们热望和平，但我们绝不会在你们的无理要求之下低头。在反侵略斗争中已经百炼成钢的中朝两国人民，是懂得怎样保卫和平的。
    总之，现在的问题很简单，美国政府是否有诚意和平解决朝鲜问题，从而同意一个公平合理的停战协议，全看美方在会内会外具体行动的表现了，中朝人民和全世界人民不能不密切地、严正地注视它的发展。
