　　Qingdao Holds Cotton Spinning Fine Yarn Worker Representative Meeting
    Vigorously Promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method
    If All Fine Yarn Workers Nationwide Produce As Little Roller Licker Waste As She Does, Annual Yarn Production Can Increase by 44,460 Pieces
    The Qingdao Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China held a Qingdao Cotton Spinning Fine Yarn Worker Representative Meeting from the 17th to the 19th of this month to promote the Hao Jianxiu work method. Outstanding fine yarn workers and technicians from all over the country, including the Northeast, Tianjin, Shanghai, Xi'an, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Guangzhou, also sent representatives to participate. Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, and Chen Weiji, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, also attended the meeting.

    The representatives discussed the significance of promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method and visited the operational performances of Hao Jianxiu workers and Hao Jianxiu herself at the state-owned Qingdao Sixth Cotton Textile Factory and other factories. In her report at the meeting, Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, calculated the value created by the Hao Jianxiu work method. She said: According to Hao Jianxiu's average roller licker waste rate of 0.25 percent over the past seven months, if the roller licker waste rate of all fine yarn workers in Qingdao were the same as Hao Jianxiu's, annual yarn production could increase by 4,256 pieces; if the roller licker waste rate of all fine yarn workers nationwide were the same as Hao Jianxiu's, annual yarn production could increase by 44,460 pieces. Chairman Chen Shaomin said: Even if the national average roller licker waste rate reached the level of the average roller licker waste rate of Hao Jianxiu's factory, the state-owned Qingdao Sixth Cotton Textile Factory (0.497 percent), the value of the increased cotton yarn production could buy sixty-eight fighter jets. If these planes were sent to the Korean battlefield, just think how many invading troops could be eliminated! Chairman Chen Shaomin also said that the Hao Jianxiu work method can not only reduce costs but also extend the life of machinery, improve workers' ability to watch over machines to save social labor, and lay the foundation for quota work. At the same time, the summarization and promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method provides administrative and trade union departments with a correct and scientific leadership method and points out to technicians a direction of effort that values workers' creations. Only with this kind of leadership method and direction of effort is it possible to concentrate many advanced production experiences, promote them, and create more wealth for the country.

    After visiting the actual performances of Hao Jianxiu herself and Hao Jianxiu workers at the state-owned Qingdao Sixth Cotton Textile Factory and the First, Second, and Third Cotton Textile Factories, the representatives had a further understanding and experience of the Hao Jianxiu work method. A representative from Tianjin said: "In the past, we thought that implementing the Hao Jianxiu work method would definitely make the workshop very tense and busy. After seeing it this time, we realized that they are all working easily, like taking a walk, in an orderly manner. We feel that our previous understanding of the Hao Jianxiu work method was very inadequate." Zhu Jiu, a nationally renowned model worker from Wuhan, said: "The Hao Jianxiu work method is not only about individual good movements, but more importantly, it is planned and not controlled by the machine." Trade union workers and technicians from various places also unanimously felt that the summarization and promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method points out a very important direction for trade union workers to lead production in a deep and concrete way and for technicians to better engage in technical management.

    After the closing of the meeting, representatives from various places will remain in Qingdao for a period of time to better learn the Hao Jianxiu work method and promote it when they return.

　　青岛市召开棉纺细纱职工代表会议
    大力推广郝建秀工作方法
    如果全国细纱工都像她少出皮辊花全年可增产四万四千四百六十件纱
    中国纺织工会青岛市委员会为推广郝建秀工作法，在本月十七日到十九日召开了青岛市棉纺细纱职工代表会议。东北、天津、上海、西安、武汉、成都、广州等全国各地的优秀细纱工人及技术人员也派了代表参加。中华全国总工会李立三副主席、中国纺织工会全国委员会陈少敏主席、中央人民政府纺织工业部陈维稷副部长也莅会。
    代表们研讨了推广郝建秀工作法的意义，并实地参观了国营青岛第六棉纺织厂及其他各厂郝建秀工作者和郝建秀本人的操作表演。中国纺织工会全国委员会陈少敏主席在会上的报告中，曾为郝建秀工作法所创造的价值算了一下账。她说：按照郝建秀七个月来平均的皮辊花率百分之零点二五计算，如果全青岛市细纱工的皮辊花率都和郝建秀的相同，全年便可增产四千二百五十六件纱；如果全国的细纱工皮辊花率都和郝建秀的相同，全年便可增产四万四千四百六十件纱。陈少敏主席说：就以全国平均的皮辊花率达到郝建秀所在厂国营青岛第六棉纺织厂的全厂平均皮辊花率的水平（百分之零点四九七）来计算，所增产的棉纱的价值便可买六十八架战斗机。这些飞机送到朝鲜战场上，大家想想能消灭多少侵略军！陈少敏主席还说，郝建秀工作法不但可以降低成本，而且能使机器寿命延长，能提高工人看台能力以节省社会劳动力，并为定额工作打下基础。同时，对郝建秀工作法的总结和推广，给行政方面和工会方面提供了一个正确的科学的领导方法，给技术人员指出了一个重视工人创造的努力方向。只有这种领导方法和努力方向，才有可能将许多先进的生产经验集中起来，推广出去，为国家创造更多的财富。
    代表们到国营青岛第六棉纺织厂和第一、二、三棉纺织厂参观了郝建秀本人及郝建秀工作者的实际表演后，对郝建秀工作法都有了进一步的认识与体会。天津市某代表说：“我们过去认为实行郝建秀工作法，车间里一定很紧张，忙的不得了。这次一看，原来都是轻松得像散步似地做着工，有条不紊，我们才觉得以前对郝建秀工作法的了解是很不够的。”武汉市全国著名劳动模范朱玖说：“郝建秀工作法不仅是个别动作好，更重要的是有计划性，不受机器支配。”来自各地的工会工作者和技术人员们也一致感到：郝建秀工作法的总结和推广给工会工作者深入具体地领导生产、技术人员更好地从事技术管理，指出了一个非常重要的方向。
    来自各地的代表在会议闭幕后，仍暂留青岛一个时期，以便更好地学习郝建秀工作法，回去推广。
