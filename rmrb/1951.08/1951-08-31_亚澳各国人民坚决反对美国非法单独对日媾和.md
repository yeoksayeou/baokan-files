　　Asian and Australian Peoples Firmly Oppose the U.S.'s Illegal Separate Peace Treaty with Japan
　　Xu Ming
　　The U.S. and British imperialists have decided to convene a so-called "Peace Conference with Japan" in San Francisco from September 4th to 8th, attempting to force countries to sign and stamp their approval on the "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" unilaterally formulated by them. It is common knowledge that the U.S.'s separate peace treaty with Japan is to give a legal cloak to its conspiracy to rearm Japan. The U.S.-made "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" is actually a tool for the U.S. to revive Japanese militarism and attempt to use it for aggressive war. This "Draft Peace Treaty" completely violates the intent of the people of all countries who sacrificed millions of lives in arduous battles against Japan, and brings new war threats to the people of Asian and Australian countries, seriously endangering the security of the people of Asian and Australian countries and undermining world peace.
　　For half a century, the people of the Far East have suffered from the long-term devastation of Japanese imperialism. Today, the people of the Far East, who are fighting for peace and national independence, have not only gained the experience of victory in the anti-fascist war in World War II, but are also inspired by the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. Their strength is powerful and invincible. They will never allow historical tragedies to repeat themselves. Therefore, the people of the Far East have universally launched a struggle against the U.S.'s rearmament of Japan and for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.
　　The Chinese people have suffered the most from the disasters of Japanese militarist aggression, resisted Japanese aggression the earliest and longest, and contributed the most to defeating the Japanese war of aggression. Therefore, they naturally have the greatest right to speak on the issue of peace with Japan; any peace treaty with Japan that is prepared, drafted, and signed without the participation of the People's Republic of China is illegal and therefore invalid. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate U.S. imperialism's support for the resurgence of Japanese militarism, resolutely oppose the U.S.'s unilateral handling of the peace treaty with Japan, and advocate a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. To date, more than 330 million Chinese people have voted against U.S. imperialism's arming of Japan. This resolute and powerful action by the Chinese people has greatly encouraged the struggle of the people of Asian and Australian countries against the U.S.-made "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan."
　　The purpose of the Far Eastern peoples' war against Japan is to prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism. A comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan must be signed to ensure that Japan becomes a peace-loving, democratic, and independent country that no longer threatens the peace and security of the Far East and the world. The Soviet Union is the country that sent troops to defeat the main force of the Japanese army, the Kwantung Army, and promoted Japan's surrender, and has always adhered to the policy of concluding a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet government's "Comments on the U.S. Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" published in May put forward proposals for concluding a fair and reasonable comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, which fully conforms to the will of the people of the Far East and has been warmly supported and unanimously endorsed by the people of the Far East.
　　What the Japanese people need most urgently at present is to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty that truly eradicates Japanese militarism, enables Japan to obtain democracy and independence, and maintains lasting peace in the Far East. The war of aggression against China and the Pacific War launched by Japanese imperialism brought two million orphans and one million eight hundred and thirty thousand widows to the Japanese people. The war destroyed two million three hundred and sixty-one thousand houses. It is estimated that thirteen million Japanese people still live in underground tramways, parks, streets, and suburbs... The Japanese people are determined not to suffer the disaster of new wars again. Therefore, despite the crazy suppression by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, the Japanese people's struggle against rearmament and demanding a comprehensive peace is still developing rapidly and extensively. In mid-January this year, more than 70 democratic parties and groups, led by the Japanese Communist Party, gathered to form the "Comprehensive Peace Patriotic Movement Council," and decided to launch a nationwide movement demanding the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty. Since then, the people of Japan have universally launched a struggle to strive for a comprehensive peace. As of August 15, more than 4.6 million people in Japan have signed against rearmament and demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty. This movement has seriously hit the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to make a separate peace. Japanese workers, peasants, students, and women have actively participated in this struggle. According to Japanese newspapers, many factory workers, ignoring the illegal ban of the U.S. occupation authorities and the Yoshida traitorous government, openly went on strike and slowdowns to oppose the production of military supplies. In the first few months of this year, the total number of striking workers averaged about one million per month. After the beginning of summer, workers across the country launched a "summer struggle." At the end of June, workers in military factories and harbor workers in Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe, Moji, Shimonoseki, Niigata and other places held large-scale strikes. More than 20 major national trade unions, including the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions, the All-Japan Publishing and Printing Workers' Union, and the Steel Industry Workers' Union Federation, unanimously and resolutely opposed rearmament and demanded the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty. The Japan Farmers' Association held its third central committee meeting at the end of May and passed a resolution demanding that a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan be realized within this year, and resolved to strengthen activities to promote its realization. Many scientists, scholars, well-known social figures, and some industrialists and businessmen have also joined this struggle. From August 14th to 18th, the Japan National Peace Congress was held in Tokyo. The delegates unanimously resolved to oppose the U.S.-made "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" and the "U.S.-Japan Military Agreement," oppose the Yoshida government's signing of the treaty regardless of the opinions of the Japanese people, and demand that a meeting of the foreign ministers of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States be held to draft the treaty and convene a peace conference attended by all countries that fought against Japan.
　　The U.S. imperialists' crimes of reviving Japanese militarism and using it to invade Korea have aroused unparalleled anger among the Korean people. The Korean people, who suffered more than 40 years of persecution from Japanese militarism and fought a long and arduous struggle to gain freedom and liberation, will never tolerate the U.S. aggressors reviving Japanese militarism to enslave them again. Hyun Heung, chairman of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, said: "This conspiracy of U.S. imperialism completely violates the interests of the people of Korea and China, as well as the Japanese people. The entire Korean people, led by the working class, absolutely cannot tolerate it." At present, the Korean people are turning their anger into strength, more heroically giving the U.S. imperialists heavy blows, in order to smash the U.S.'s conspiracy to make a separate peace.
　　During its occupation of Vietnam, Japanese militarism cruelly massacred the Vietnamese people and colluded with the French colonialists to plunder the Vietnamese people's rice, causing more than two million Vietnamese people to starve to death. The Vietnamese people will never forget this blood debt. The Vietnamese people, who resisted Japanese aggression for five years and are now continuing to resist the French aggressors and U.S. imperialist interventionists in order to win national independence and liberation, strongly protest against the U.S.'s revival of Japanese militarism and separate peace with Japan, and demand that a comprehensive peace treaty be concluded with the participation of China, the Soviet Union, and all countries that fought against Japan. The Vietnamese people believe that "only such a treaty can maintain peace in Southeast Asia and the Far East." (Vietnam News Agency)
　　The people of India, Burma, and Indonesia unanimously oppose the U.S.'s illegal separate peace treaty with Japan. The All-India Trade Union Congress, the All-India Peasants' Alliance, and the All-India Students' Federation of India have all declared that they will never accept the U.S.'s draft separate peace treaty with Japan, and are determined to strive for a genuine peace treaty with Japan and conduct a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan on the basis of consultations among the countries concerned. In 1943, due to Japan's aggression, the Bengal famine in India starved 3.5 million people to death. Japanese planes cruelly bombed the Assam border... These tragic memories make the Indian people resolutely oppose the U.S. aggressors' revival of Japanese militarism and its use for aggression in Asia.
　　Due to the aggression of Japanese imperialism, the Burmese people suffered deeply. According to Burmese government statistics, Burma's property losses in the Pacific War amounted to 18.298 billion rupees. On August 12 this year, representatives of more than 20 units, including the Burmese World Peace Congress, the Burmese Workers and Peasants Party, the People's Party, the People's Peace Front, the Thakins Party, and workers, peasants, students, and women's organizations, met to discuss the issue of opposing the U.S.-made draft treaty, and decided to convene an enlarged meeting of various parties to discuss the establishment of a preparatory committee for a mass movement against the U.S.-made peace treaty with Japan, to lead the Burmese people's struggle against the U.S.'s separate peace treaty. On August 25, the Burmese branch of the World Peace Congress held a mass meeting in Rangoon attended by more than 3,000 people, unanimously condemning the U.S.-made "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan."
　　During the occupation by Japanese militarism, the Indonesian people were violently plundered and left with nothing, and could only cover themselves with sacks or bark. Hundreds of thousands of Indonesian people were sacrificed in the War of Resistance Against Japan; more than two million Indonesian people were forced to serve as "laborers" and suffered the enslavement of the Japanese. The Indonesian people realize that "if the U.S.'s separate peace treaty with Japan is signed without the participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, Indonesia will become a victim of Japanese militarism under the direction of the United States for the second time." Therefore, the Indonesian people resolutely oppose the U.S.'s separate peace treaty with Japan.
　　During its occupation of the Philippines, Japanese imperialism implemented the "three alls" policy, cruelly suppressing the people's liberation movement, causing the people to suffer heavy disasters. Although the Philippines is under the control of U.S. imperialism today, the Filipino people are determinedly against the US arming of Japan and its separate peace with Japan. This struggle has put the Quirino puppet government in a very embarrassing situation. Since the U.S. imperialists carried out the conspiracy of making a separate peace with Japan, they have repeatedly exerted pressure on the Filipino people. Dulles even personally went to the Philippines to carry out activities, but the result was only to deepen the anger of the Filipino people. On July 17, the Filipino people held a grand demonstration in Manila. In an impassioned mood of opposing the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan, the demonstrators burned the portrait of Dulles, the drafter of the U.S. separate peace treaty with Japan, in the central square to protest. Under the pressure of the people, the Quirino clique had to make a request to its master, U.S. imperialism, for Japanese reparations. Philippine Foreign Minister Romulo also had to write to Dulles, begging: "If the Philippine government accepts the U.S.'s demand not to demand compensation from Japan, it may cause a major revolution in the country."
　　On February 14 this year, a few hours after Dulles arrived in Sydney, the capital of Australia, to carry out the conspiracy of making a separate peace with Japan, the Australian people held an unprecedented demonstration, with the masses chanting: "Oppose the U.S. arming Japan!" "Dulles go home!" The Australian people clearly realize that the U.S.-made "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" and the "Pacific Pact" are all criminal plans to betray the Australian people. They are enthusiastically launching a struggle against the U.S.-made "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" and the "Pacific Pact." Since August 12, the Australian people have begun to hold a "National Patriotic Protest Week Against Arming Japan." In the past few days, the working people have held many mass meetings to protest against the U.S.-made draft separate peace treaty with Japan.
　　The expanding struggle of the people of Asian and Australian countries against the U.S.'s rearmament of Japan and for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan is an inseparable part of the world people's struggle to defend peace. This struggle has won the enthusiastic support of people all over the world, including the people of the U.S. and Britain.
　　The separate peace treaty with Japan unilaterally handled by U.S. imperialism will never be approved by the people of Asian and Australian countries. Its illegal conspiracy to make a separate peace will surely be shattered by the powerful peace forces of the people of Asian and Australian countries.

　　亚澳各国人民坚决反对美国非法单独对日媾和
    徐  明
    美英帝国主义决定九月四日至八日在旧金山召开所谓“对日和会”，企图强使各国在它片面制订的“对日和约草案”上签字画押。人所共知：美国单独对日媾和，是为了使它的重新武装日本的阴谋计划披上合法的外衣。美制“对日和约草案”，实际就是美国复活日本军国主义并企图利用其进行侵略战争的工具。这个“和约草案”完全违反了各国人民牺牲千百万生命艰苦对日作战的意旨，并且给亚澳各国人民带来了新的战争威胁，严重地危害了亚澳各国人民的安全，破坏了世界的和平。
    半世纪来，远东各国人民曾遭受日本帝国主义的长期蹂躏。今天，为争取和平与民族独立而斗争的远东各国人民，不仅在第二次世界大战中取得了反法西斯战争的胜利经验，而且为中国人民革命胜利所鼓舞，其力量是强大无敌的。他们决不容许历史悲剧重演。因此，远东各国人民普遍掀起了反对美国重新武装日本、争取缔结全面对日和约的斗争。
    中国人民遭受日本军国主义侵略的灾害最深，抵抗日本侵略最早、最久，在击败日本侵略战争中贡献也最大。因此在对日媾和问题上，当然具有最大的发言权利；任何没有中华人民共和国参加筹备、拟订与签署的对日和约，都是非法的，因而也是无效的。中国人民绝对不能容忍美帝国主义扶植日本军国主义再起，坚决反对美国一手包办对日和约，主张全面对日媾和。至目前为止，中国人民投票反对美帝国主义武装日本的人数已有三亿三千万以上。中国人民这一坚决有力的行动，大大鼓舞了亚澳各国人民反对美制“对日和约草案”的斗争。
    远东各国人民对日作战的目的，在于制止日本军国主义再起。必须签订一个全面的公正的对日和约，以保证使日本成为爱好和平的、民主的、独立的国家，不再威胁远东与世界的和平安全。苏联是出兵击溃日本军队主力关东军、促使日本投降的国家，一贯坚持缔结全面对日和约的政策。苏联政府于五月间发表的“对美国对日和约草案意见书”中所提出的要求缔结公平合理的全面对日和约的建议，完全符合远东人民的意旨，得到远东人民的热烈支持与一致拥护。
    日本人民当前最迫切需要的，是缔结一个真正根绝日本军国主义，使日本能获得民主和独立，维持远东持久和平的全面和约。日本帝国主义发动的侵华战争和太平洋战争给日本人民带来了两百万孤儿和一百八十三万寡妇。战火损毁了二百三十六万一千幢房屋。据估计有一千三百万日本人迄今还在地下电车道、公园、街头及郊野等处栖宿……日本人民决不愿再遭受新的战争的灾祸。因此，尽管美、日反动派疯狂镇压，日本人民反对重新武装、要求全面媾和的斗争仍然迅速而广泛地发展着。今年一月中旬，以日本共产党为首的七十多个民主党派与团体集会组成了“全面媾和爱国运动协议会”，决定发动全国规模的要求签订全面和约的运动，此后，日本全国各地人民就普遍展开争取全面媾和的斗争。到八月十五日止，日本全国已有四百六十余万人签名反对重新武装、要求缔结全面和约，这一运动严重地打击了美、日反动派单独媾和的阴谋。日本工人、农民、学生、妇女都积极参加了这一斗争。据日本报纸报道，许多工厂工人不顾美国占领当局及吉田卖国政府的非法禁令，公开怠工、罢工，反对生产军用物资。今年的前几个月，罢工工人的总数，平均每月约一百万人。入夏后，全国工人又展开了“夏季斗争”。六月底，东京、横滨、神户、门司、下关、新潟等地的军事工厂工人和海港工人都举行了大罢工。全日本产业别工会会议、全日本出版印刷工会、钢铁工业工会联合会等二十多个主要的全国性工会一致坚决反对重新武装，要求缔结全面和约。日本农民协会在五月底召开第三届中央委员会，通过决议，要求本年内实现全面对日媾和，并决议加强活动以促其实现。许多科学家、学者及社会知名人士和一部分工商业者也都加入了这个斗争。八月十四日至十八日，日本全国和平大会在东京举行。与会代表一致决议反对美制“对日和约草案”与“日美军事协定”，反对吉田政府不顾日本人民的意见而签订和约，并要求召开中、苏、英、美外长会议草拟和约及召开所有对日作战国家参加的和会。
    美帝国主义复活日本军国主义并利用其侵略朝鲜的罪行，激起朝鲜人民无比的愤怒。曾经遭受日本军国主义四十余年的迫害、进行了长期而且艰苦的斗争才获得自由解放的朝鲜人民，决不能容忍美国侵略者复活日本军国主义再来奴役他们。朝鲜职业总同盟委员长玄勋表示：“美帝国主义这一阴谋，完全违反朝、中两国人民以及日本人民的利益。以工人阶级为首的全朝鲜人民绝对不能容忍。”目前，朝鲜人民正把愤怒化为力量，更英勇地给予美帝国主义者沉重打击，以粉碎美国单独媾和的阴谋。
    日本军国主义在侵占越南期间，曾残酷地屠杀越南人民，并和法国殖民者勾结抢劫越南人民的米谷，因而使两百多万越南人民饿死。越南人民永远也忘不了这笔血债。曾经抗拒日本侵略五年之久、现在正继续抵抗法国侵略者和美帝国主义干涉者、争取民族独立解放的越南人民，强烈抗议美国复活日本军国主义与单独对日媾和，并要求在中国、苏联和一切对日作战国家参加下缔结全面和约。越南人民认为：“只有这样的和约，才能维持东南亚和远东的和平。”（越南通讯社电）
    印度、缅甸、和印尼人民一致反对美国的非法单独对日和约。印度的全印总工会、全印农民联盟、全印学生联合会都宣告他们决不接受美国单独对日和约草案，决心争取真正的对日和约，并在各有关国家协议的基础上进行全面对日媾和。一九四三年因日本的侵略，造成了印度饿死三百五十万人的孟加拉大饥荒，日本飞机曾在阿萨密边境残酷轰炸……这些惨痛的回忆，使印度人民坚决反对美国侵略者复活日本军国主义和利用它在亚洲进行侵略。
    由于日本帝国主义的侵略，缅甸人民遭受了深重的灾难。据缅甸政府的统计，在太平洋战争中，缅甸的财产损失达一百八十二亿九千八百万卢比。今年八月十二日，缅甸拥护世界和平大会、缅甸工农党、人民党、人民和平阵线、德钦党和工人、农民、学生及妇女团体等二十多个单位代表集会讨论反对美制和约草案问题，决定召开各党派扩大会议，商讨成立反对美制对日和约群众运动筹备委员会，领导缅甸人民反对美国单独媾和的斗争。八月二十五日，世界和平大会缅甸分会在仰光召开了三千多人参加的群众大会，一致谴责美制“对日和约草案”。
    在日本军国主义占领期间，印尼人民被强暴掠夺得一无所有，甚至只能用麻袋或树皮遮身。印尼人民在抗日战争中牺牲了数十万人；两百多万印尼人民被迫去充当“劳务者”而受尽日本人的奴役。印尼人民认识到：“假若没有苏联和中华人民共和国的参加而签订了美国的单独对日和约，印尼又要第二次成为美国指使下的日本军国主义的牺牲者”，因此，印尼人民坚决反对美国单独对日媾和。
    日本帝国主义占领菲律宾期间，曾实行了“三光”政策，残酷地镇压人民解放运动，而使人民遭受惨重的灾难。今天菲律宾虽然在美帝国主义控制下，但是，菲律宾人民坚决反对美国武装日本与单独对日媾和，这一斗争已使季里诺傀儡政府陷于非常狼狈的境地。美帝国主义自进行单独对日媾和阴谋活动以来，一再对菲律宾人民使用压力，杜勒斯且曾亲自到菲活动，但结果只是更加深了菲律宾人民的愤怒。七月十七日，菲律宾人民在马尼拉举行了盛大的示威游行，示威群众在反对美国对日和约草案的激昂情绪下，在中央广场焚毁了美国单独对日和约草案的起草人杜勒斯的肖像，以示抗议。在人民的压力下，季里诺集团不得不向它的主子—美帝国主义提出索取日本赔款的要求。菲外长罗慕洛也不得不致函杜勒斯哀告：“菲政府如接受美国的不向日本索取赔偿的要求，就可能引起国内大革命。”
    今年二月十四日，当杜勒斯为了进行单独对日媾和的阴谋抵达澳大利亚首都悉尼后的数小时后，澳大利亚人民举行了空前的示威游行，群众高呼着：“反对美国武装日本！”“杜勒斯滚回去！”澳大利亚人民清楚地认识到，美制“对日和约草案”和“太平洋公约”都是出卖澳大利亚人民的罪恶计划，他们热烈展开反对美制“对日和约草案”和“太平洋公约”的斗争。自八月十二日起，澳大利亚人民开始举行“全国反对武装日本爱国抗议周”，几天来，劳动人民已举行了许多次的群众大会，抗议美制单独对日和约草案。
    日益扩展着的亚澳各国人民反对美国重新武装日本，争取缔结全面对日和约的斗争，是世界人民保卫和平斗争不可分的一部分，这一斗争已获得全世界人民包括美英各国人民在内的热烈支援。
    美帝国主义一手包办的单独对日和约，绝不会得到亚澳各国人民的批准。它非法进行的单独媾和的阴谋，必将为强大的亚澳各国人民的和平力量所粉碎。
