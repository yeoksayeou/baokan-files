    The Eight Heroes Who Defied Death
    By Jiang Ping
    (IV) The battle-hardened heroes knew how to fight under the enemy's fierce artillery fire. Enemy shells destroyed pine forests and shattered rocks, but did not harm a single hair on the eight heroes.
    (V) At nine o'clock in the morning, the enemy's artillery fire ceased. An enemy battalion, panting like cows, climbed upwards, grabbing trees and rocks.
    (VI) The eight heroes, lying in wait, suddenly attacked the enemy with hand grenades, machine guns, and submachine guns when they had climbed to within thirty meters of the hilltop, killing more than thirty enemies. The remaining enemies dragged their corpses and rolled down the mountain.

    宁死不屈的八勇士
    江平作
    （四）身经百战的勇士们是懂得怎样在敌人猛烈炮火下进行作战的，敌人炮弹炸掉了松林，炸裂了岩石，可是没有伤了八勇士的一根汗毛。
    （五）早晨九点钟，敌人的炮声停止了。敌步兵一个营，攀树扒石气喘如牛地向上爬。
    （六）严阵以待的八勇士，等敌人爬到距山头只三十多公尺时，突然以手榴弹和机枪、冲锋枪向敌猛击，打死敌人三十多，其余的敌人拖着死尸滚下山去了。
