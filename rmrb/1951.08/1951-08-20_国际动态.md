　　The "Guilty" Man Who Refused to Commit a Crime
　　Twenty-two-year-old American soldier Wenger was a recruit training at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. When he first entered the camp, a major in charge of training gave them a "lecture" saying: "I am assigned to train you to be professional killers. I want to make you the most powerful killers."
　　After hearing this, Wenger refused to become a killer and asked to be transferred to the medical team. As a result, Wenger was sentenced to one year of hard labor by the American reactionaries.
　　In the United States, a person who refuses to commit murder is instead convicted. This is the "American way of life" and "American democracy" boasted by the US imperialist ruling clique, which is addicted to aggression.

　　Another Slap in Morrison's Face
　　Representatives of the British-Soviet Friendship Society visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. One of the representatives, Hobbs, told a TASS reporter about his impressions of the visit: "We came to the Soviet Union to deeply understand the living conditions of the Soviet people, and then return to Britain to report it truthfully. During the visit, we had the opportunity to see the large-scale construction work in various sectors of the national economy. This kind of construction is only possible in a country where the people sincerely desire peace."
　　Hobbs's remarks are a resounding slap in the face to British Foreign Secretary Morrison, who has recently slandered the Soviet Union. People can see more clearly Morrison's despicable face of spreading lies. He is just a mouthpiece for Wall Street bosses creating world tension!

　　A Shameful Deal
　　Recently, the US government sold a batch of wheat to Belgium under the so-called "Marshall Plan." The transaction price was 5,875 francs per ton, but at the same time Belgian farmers could only sell their wheat for 4,300 francs per ton. A large part of the wheat delivered by the United States was worm-eaten and inedible, and flour mills did not want it because it could not be used to bake bread. The Belgian people suffered great losses because of their government's shameful deal.
　　This is how Wall Street uses "US aid" to exploit the blood and sweat of the people through its Western European lackeys.

    不愿犯罪的“罪”人
    二十二岁的美国兵温哥是在密苏里州利奥诺德·伍德堡受训的新兵。当他第一次入营时，负责训练的一个少校向他们“训话”说：“我是被派来把你们训练成职业杀人者的。我要把你们造成最厉害的杀人者。”
    温哥在听了这话后，拒绝做杀人者，而要求转入医疗队工作。因此，温哥被美国反动派判处一年苦役。
    在美国，不愿犯杀人罪的人，反而被判了罪，这就是侵略成性的美帝国主义统治集团所吹嘘的“美国生活方式”和“美国民主”。
    又打了莫里逊一个耳光
    英苏友好协会的代表应苏联对外文化协会的邀请，在苏联游历访问。代表之一的霍布斯接见塔斯社记者述说访苏感想称：“我们来到苏联，想深切了解苏联人民的生活状况，然后回英国去忠实地报道出来。在访问期间，我们有机会看到国民经济各部门大规模的建设工作。只有在人民真诚渴望和平的一个国家中，这种建设才有可能。”
    霍布斯的谈话，对于最近曾大肆诽谤苏联的英外相莫里逊是一个响亮的耳光，人们更可以看清莫里逊散布谎言的卑劣的嘴脸，他不过是华尔街老板制造世界紧张局势的传声筒！
    可耻的交易
    最近，美国政府根据所谓“马歇尔计划”卖给比利时一批小麦。成交的价格是每吨五千八百七十五法郎，但是同时比利时农民的小麦每吨才只卖四千三百法郎。美国运交的小麦中，很大一部分是虫蛀过的，不能吃，面粉厂都不要，因为它不能烘面包。比利时人民因为他们的政府这笔可耻的交易遭到很大损失。
    华尔街就是这样用“美援”通过它的西欧奴仆榨取人民的血汗。
