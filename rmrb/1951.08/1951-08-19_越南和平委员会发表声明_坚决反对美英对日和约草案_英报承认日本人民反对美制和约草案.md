　　Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, August 16th: The Vietnam Peace Committee issued a statement stating that Vietnam's peace defenders firmly oppose the separate draft peace treaty with Japan manufactured by the US and British governments, and express their indignation at the fact that the two governments convened the French colonialists and the Bao Dai clique, who had succumbed to Japanese fascism, to participate in the discussion.
    The statement continued: Vietnam's peace defenders fully support the just position of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China regarding the peace treaty with Japan, and solemnly declare that the Vietnamese people resolutely fought against Japanese fascism in World War II, and that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh fully represents the Vietnamese people and is fully entitled to participate in the discussion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.
    The statement concluded: Vietnam's peace defenders and the people of the whole country pledge to closely unite with the people of Laos and Cambodia, and to cooperate closely with the Japanese people and the people of the world, to fight to the end against the US-British separate draft peace treaty with Japan, against all conspiracies to provoke another world war, and to defend world peace.

    Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: According to a Reuter report from London on August 16th: The Tokyo correspondent of "The Times" reported that a recent public opinion survey conducted by the Tokyo bourgeois newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun" on the US-made draft peace treaty with Japan showed that "more than half of the residents oppose the stationing of US troops in Japan after the conclusion of the peace treaty, and oppose leasing bases to the United States." The correspondent said that only 8 percent of the people were completely satisfied with Dulles' draft. He concluded by saying, "In recent weeks, it has become clear that a large number of Japanese people are opposed to the so-called 'peace treaty'."

    The British "Manchester Guardian" is very worried that the US-made draft peace treaty with Japan may eventually be boycotted by all Asian countries. The newspaper said: "The danger is that this peace treaty may be reduced to a kind of treaty between Japan and Western governments."

    Xinhua News Agency: Reuter, Sydney, August 14th: Hillary, the initiator of the Sydney Anti-Conscription League, told the Sydney "Forum" that ordinary Australians believe that the US peace treaty with Japan is a "blatant betrayal."
    Hillary said: "The Anti-Conscription League feels that this so-called 'peace treaty' is a step towards the Third World War."
    He said that the only way to achieve peace is to reduce armaments, not to rearm Japan, nor to force conscription of Australian youth and workers into the army.

　　越南和平委员会发表声明
    坚决反对美英对日和约草案
    英报承认日本人民反对美制和约草案
    【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社北越十六日电：越南和平委员会发表声明称：越南和平保卫者坚决反对美、英两国政府制造的单独对日和约草案，并对该两国政府召集向日本法西斯屈膝的法国殖民者和保大集团参加讨论一事表示愤慨。
    声明继称：越南和平保卫者完全拥护苏联和中华人民共和国关于对日媾和的正义立场，并郑重声明：越南人民在第二次世界大战中曾坚决对日本法西斯主义作战，而胡志明主席领导下的越南民主共和国政府是完全代表越南人民的，完全有权参加讨论全面的对日和约。
    声明最后称：越南和平保卫者和全国人民保证与老挝和柬埔寨人民紧密团结，与日本人民和全世界人民密切合作，为反对美英单独对日和约草案，反对挑引另一次世界大战的一切阴谋和保卫世界和平而奋斗到底。
    【新华社十八日讯】据电通社伦敦十六日讯：《泰晤士报》驻东京记者报道，东京资产阶级报纸《读卖新闻》最近就美制对日和约草案所进行的民意调查显示：“一半以上的居民反对在和约缔结后美军留驻日本，并反对把基地租借给美国。”该记者说：只有百分之八的人完全满意杜勒斯的草案。他在结语中说：“最近几周已很明显，有大量的日本人对所谓‘和约’抱着反对的态度。”
    英国《曼彻斯特卫报》非常忧虑美制对日和约草案最后可能为全部亚洲国家所抵制。该报说：“危险是这个和约可能缩小为日本和西方各国政府间的一种和约。”
    【新华社讯】电通社悉尼十四日讯：悉尼反征兵联盟发起人希莱告悉尼《论坛报》说：一般的澳大利亚人认为美国的对日和约是“公然的背叛”。
    希莱说：“反征兵同盟觉得这个所谓‘和约’是走向第三次大战的一个步骤”。
    他说：争取和平的唯一方法是裁减军备，而不是重新武装日本，也不是强迫征召澳大利亚青年与劳工当兵。
