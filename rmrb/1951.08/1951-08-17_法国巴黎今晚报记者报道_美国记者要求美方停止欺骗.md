　　French Paris Evening News Reporter Reports
    American Reporters Demand U.S. Stop Deception
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] According to a report from Kaesong on the 15th by Paris Evening News reporter Bertrand, a group of enraged American news reporters demanded that the United Nations Command delegation's press officer, Brigadier General Nuckols, stop telling lies. They demanded he confirm that the United States was asking North Korea for 12,000 square kilometers of land, and that he confirm that his previous report that Joy demanded that the demarcation line be drawn along the current battlefield was a pure lie. These news reporters were angered because they overheard a debate during the meeting on the 14th. They overheard under the eaves that Vice Admiral Joy repeatedly demanded that, due to the superiority of the naval and air forces, the demarcation line should be drawn deep into North Korean territory, and also heard Nam Il angrily refuting it. General Nam Il rendered Joy speechless with sharp questions and rebuttals; Joy could only weakly repeat the clichés he had said at the past fifteen meetings. For the past three days, news reporters have asked Nuckols to confirm or deny the facts that I and other news reporters have reported; but Nuckols ignored their questions, scolded these news reporters for believing "Communist propaganda," and severely scrutinized news reports reporting the truth. These news reports would completely expose the American deception.

    美国记者要求美方停止欺骗
    【新华社十六日讯】据法国巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌十五日自开城报道称：一群激怒了的美国新闻记者要求联合国军代表团新闻发布官纳科斯准将停止讲假话，要他证实美国向北朝鲜要求一万二千方公里的土地，并要他证实他以前所报道的所谓乔埃要求沿目前战场划定分界线的消息纯是谎言。这些新闻记者所以恼怒，是因为他们偷听到十四日会议中的一段争辩。他们在檐下偷听到海军中将乔埃一再要求，由于海空军的优势而应把分界线深深划入北朝鲜地域，并且也听见南日愤怒地予以驳斥。南日将军用尖锐的问题和反驳把乔埃问得无言以对；乔埃只能无力地重复过去十五次会议上说过的滥调。过去三天内，新闻记者们曾要求纳科斯对于我和其他新闻记者所报道的事实真相予以证实或否认；但纳科斯对他们的问题置之不理，责骂这些新闻记者听信“共产党的宣传”，并且严厉地检查报道事实真相的新闻稿。这些新闻稿是会全部揭穿美国的欺诈手段的。
