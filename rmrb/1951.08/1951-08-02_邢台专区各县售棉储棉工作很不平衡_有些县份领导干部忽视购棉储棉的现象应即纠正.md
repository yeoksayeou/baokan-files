In the patriotic cotton selling and storing campaign initially launched in Xingtai Region, Hebei Province, from late June to early July, considerable achievements were made. Including May and early and mid-June, nearly 50% of the total task was completed. However, looking at the counties separately, the progress of the work is very uneven. In the main cotton-producing areas, Nangong County completed slightly over 44% of the task, Wei County completed slightly under 39%, and Julu County completed slightly over 63%. Xinhe completed slightly over 65%. But Guangzong County only completed 19%. Lincheng County planted 40,000 mu of cotton last year, but now only 5,750 jin of ginned cotton have been purchased. Nanhe County only completed 467 jin. The leading organs in the counties with the worst performance, such as Baixiang, Nanhe, and Longyao, still lack understanding of the political task of patriotic cotton selling and storing, and do not pay attention to it. They blindly emphasize that there is not much cotton in storage, and their confidence in completing the task is very insufficient, saying, "We see the task, but we just can't complete it." Not only did they start late and not put in much effort, but Nanhe County also tried hard to find evidence to prove that there was no cotton. The county subjectively calculated an account and said that there were only about ten cotton farmers in the whole county with more than 100 jin of cotton in storage. According to this situation, overcoming the phenomenon that some county leaders neglect cotton purchase and storage and blindly emphasize that there is not much cotton in storage, and striving for balanced development of the campaign, is one of the most important links in completing the cotton purchase and storage task.
            Pest Control Should Be Combined with Cotton Purchase and Storage
    Since July 10th, due to the spread of cotton aphids, all areas have shifted to focusing on aphid control, and the cotton purchase and storage work in the entire region has fallen into a slump, with the purchase volume decreasing sharply. Before the 10th, the average daily purchase of ginned cotton in the region was more than 90,000 jin, but after the 10th, it dropped to more than 34,000 jin. In Nangong County, the average daily purchase of ginned cotton was more than 32,000 jin before, but it has now dropped to more than 12,000 jin. The main reason for this situation is that there is a lack of good unified arrangements and leadership in various areas on how to combine pest control with cotton purchase work, resulting in most counties relaxing or abandoning the cotton selling and storing work. Baixiang County has cancelled the cotton purchase and storage office; the instructions given to county and district cadres in Shahe County did not mention a word about cotton purchase and storage; Nanhe County instructed districts and villages to "eliminate all pests before carrying out cotton purchase and storage work." The district leaders in Nangong County verbally called for "combining," but in reality, most villages were controlling pests in "solo combat." In the fourth district of the county, out of 91 villages, only two villages had achievements in combining cotton purchase and storage. Another important reason for this situation is that the counties with considerable achievements in cotton purchase believed that it was "almost done," that the "shock" period was over, and that further mobilization would not be effective. A responsible cadre in the first district of Wei County said: "The cotton has been fully mobilized, and in a few more days it will be basically over, and the whole district can only complete slightly more than one-tenth of the task." But the actual situation is not like this. It has now been discovered that there are still households with 300 to 1,000 jin of cotton in storage in Shijiazhuang Village of the district, which the cadres had not discovered in the past. In the counties with poor cotton purchase performance, they are even more emphasizing that "there is no cotton." Therefore, pest control must be combined with cotton purchase, and in addition to unified arrangements, the cadres' understanding needs to be changed.
            The Political Consciousness of the Masses Should Not Be Underestimated
    In addition, there are two other deviations that need to be overcome. One is underestimating the degree of political consciousness of the masses and negating the power of political mobilization. For example, some cadres in Longyao County dared not conduct open political mobilization in the cotton purchase work, fearing that the cotton farmers would hear the news and disperse the cotton; therefore, they only carried out individual mobilization in a roundabout way. But as a result, the masses' concerns increased even more. The cadres working in Dongliang Village adopted this method and only mobilized 600 jin out of the village's more than 50,000 jin of cotton in storage. A considerable number of village cadres did not conduct good political mobilization in the cotton purchase and storage work, but adopted simple and crude methods. Some people would ask the cotton farmers "Do you have any cotton?" as soon as they opened their mouths, and if the cotton farmers answered "No," they would just let it go. Some people conduct patriotic education in isolation, and cannot combine the long-term interests of the farmers with the immediate problems. For example, many people in the second district of Wei County weave towels, and after our cadres conducted patriotic cotton selling education for them, some people asked the cadres: "If we sell all the cotton to the state, how can we weave?" But the cadres did not use the method of carefully calculating accounts to mobilize these women to participate in agricultural production and sell the cotton, and individual village cadres even threatened the cotton farmers, saying: "Keeping a jin of cotton for yourself is like sheltering an American soldier!"
            Purchase and Supply Should Actively Adapt to the Farmers
    The second deviation is that the purchase and supply work cannot actively adapt to the farmers. At present, farm work is very busy, and the farmers do not have time to go to the market, but our economic work cadres are not actively thinking of ways. Most cotton stations in Nangong are now only purchasing at a few points, and the masses cannot come directly due to pest control, so the people at the cotton stations are idle and do nothing, and do not go to the countryside to purchase. In terms of material supply, they only say that there is as much as you want, but they do not go to the countryside to promote sales and mobilize the masses to exchange cotton for goods. This phenomenon makes the stagnation of the cotton purchase work even more difficult to break.
            Never Relax Until the Task is Completed!
    Based on the above situation, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Special Zone held an emergency meeting on July 18th, and decided to further strengthen the leadership over the cotton purchase work. The Deputy Commissioner and two members of the Financial and Economic Committee have led 52 cadres to Nangong, Wei County, Julu and other major cotton-producing counties to supervise and inspect. The Special Zone Pest Control Headquarters Office, the Production Joint Office and the Cotton Purchase Office are merged into one office for unified leadership. The Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee and the Commissioner personally grasp the unified leadership and inspection of pest control and cotton purchase, disseminate experience, and launch challenges and competitions between districts and between villages. At the same time, an emergency instruction was issued, requiring all offices to merge into one office under the unified leadership of the Party Committee to strengthen the leadership over the cotton purchase work; members of the County Party Committee should go to each district to strengthen leadership. The instructions especially emphasized the importance of mobilizing women and organizing mobile purchases and supplies, and required all areas to seriously strengthen these two aspects of work. Nangong and Longyao have convened mobilization meetings for district and village cadres in separate districts, and have re-mobilized and deployed. At the meeting, challenges and responses were launched between districts and between villages, and a cotton storage and sales competition was launched. The enthusiasm of the cadres began to increase, and they expressed that they would not eliminate pests, not complete the purchase task, and not relax. Nangong immediately strengthened its work after the meeting, and the amount of cotton on the market has increased. On the 21st, the market in the city alone purchased 17,733 jin of seed cotton.

### 邢台专区各县售棉储棉工作很不平衡  有些县份领导干部忽视购棉储棉的现象应即纠正

　　邢台专区各县售棉储棉工作很不平衡
    有些县份领导干部忽视购棉储棉的现象应即纠正
    河北省邢台专区在六月下旬至七月上旬初步开展的爱国售棉储棉运动中，取得了相当的成绩。连五月份及六月上、中旬合计，完成总任务的百分之五十弱。但把各县分开来看，工作的开展是很不平衡的。主要产棉区的南宫县完成任务百分之四十四强，威县完成任务百分之三十九弱，巨鹿县完成任务百分之六十三强。新河完成任务百分之六十五强。但广宗县则仅完成任务百分之十九。临城县去年种棉四万亩，现只收购皮棉五千七百五十斤。南和县只完成四百六十七斤。成绩最差的柏乡、南和、隆尧等县领导机关，至今对爱国售棉储棉这一政治任务缺乏认识，不加重视，只是盲目地强调存棉不多，对完成任务的信心十分不足，说“看见任务了，反正完不成任务”。不但动手晚，用力不大，南和县还硬找材料证明无棉。该县主观地算了个账，就说全县存棉百斤以上的棉农只有十来户。根据这一情况，克服部分县份领导干部忽视购棉储棉和盲目强调存棉不多的现象，争取运动平衡发展，是完成购棉储棉任务的最重要环节之一。
            治虫要和购棉储棉工作结合
    自七月十日以来，由于棉蚜蔓延，各地转以治蚜为中心，全区的购储棉花工作即陷于消沉状态，收购量随之大减。全区十日以前每日平均收购皮棉九万多斤，十日以后减至三万四千多斤。南宫县以前每天平均收皮棉三万二千多斤，这时降为一万二千多斤。造成此种情况的主要原因，是各地对于治虫中如何结合进行购棉工作缺乏很好的统一布置与领导，致大部县份放松或放弃了售棉储棉工作。柏乡县将购储棉花办公室取消了；沙河县给县区干部的指示信上对购储棉工作一字未提；南和县指示区村“灭净虫害再进行购储棉花工作”。南宫县区领导干部口喊“结合”，实际上绝大部分村庄是“单打一”地治虫。该县四区九十一个村，只有两个村在结合购棉储棉上有成绩。产生这种情况的另一重要原因是：购储棉花有相当成绩的县份，认为“差不多”了，“突击”期满了，再动员也作用不大了。威县一区负责干部说：“棉花动员净了，再搞几天就大体结束，全区任务只能完成十分之一强。”但实际情况并不如此。该区石家庄村现已发现仍有三百斤至一千斤的存棉户，而过去干部没有发现。在购棉成绩不好的县份，更是强调“没有棉花”。所以，治虫要与购棉结合，除需要统一布置外，还需要干部的认识转变。
            不应过低估计群众政治觉悟
    另外，还有两种偏向需要克服。一种是过低估计群众的政治觉悟程度，否定政治动员的力量。如隆尧县有些干部，在购棉工作中不敢公开进行政治动员，怕棉农听到风声，把棉花疏散了；因此只是拐湾摸角地进行个别动员。但结果反而使群众顾虑更加增多。在东良村工作的干部采取这种方法，只将该村五万余斤存棉动员出来六百斤。有相当数量的村干部，在购棉储棉工作中未进行很好的政治动员而采取了简单生硬的办法，一种人是一开口就问棉农“有没有棉花”，棉农回答说“没有了”，就算了。一种人是孤立地进行爱国教育，不能把农民的长远利益和眼前问题结合起来解决。如威县二区织毛巾的很多，我们的干部对他们进行了爱国售棉教育后，有的人问干部说：“把棉花都售存给国家，怎样纺织呢？”但干部们没有用细算账的办法动员这些妇女参加农业生产，把棉花卖出来，个别村干部甚至威胁棉农说：“自己留一斤花就是掩护一个美国兵！”
            收购与供应要主动适应农民
    第二种偏向，是收购与供应工作不能主动适应农民。目前农事很忙，农民无暇到市场上去，而我们的经济工作干部们也不积极想办法。南宫大多数棉站现在只在几个点点收购，群众因打虫不能直接前来，棉站的人就闲着不作事，也不下乡收购。在物资供应上，只说要多少有多少，但也不下乡推销，发动群众以棉换货。这种现象，使购棉工作的停滞局面更难打开。
            不完成任务决不松劲！
    根据上述情况，专区财政经济委员会于七月十八日召开紧急会议，决定进一步加强对购棉工作的领导。副专员同两个财政经济委员会委员已带领干部五十二人到主要产棉区南宫、威县、巨鹿等县进行督促检查。专区除虫指挥部办公室、生产联合办公室与收购棉花办公室合并办公，统一领导。地委书记和专员亲自掌握除治虫害与收购棉花工作的统一领导和检查，传播经验，并发动区与区村与村进行挑战竞赛。同时发出紧急指示，要求各办公室在党委统一领导下合并办公，加强对收购棉花工作的领导；县委委员分头到各区加强领导。指示特别强调指出，发动妇女和组织流动收购和供应的重要性，要求各地认真加强这两方面的工作。南宫、隆尧已分区召开了区、村干部动员大会，重新进行了动员布置。会上区与区、村与村开展了挑战应战，发动了储棉售棉竞赛，干部情绪开始提高，表示不消灭虫害不完成收购任务不松劲。南宫在会后马上加强工作，现棉花上市量已见增多。仅城内二十一日一集就收购了籽棉一万七千七百三十三斤。
