French "Tonight" Reporter and Others Report

　　Investigation of U.S. Aircraft Bombing Kaesong Atrocity

　　U.S. Liaison Officer Acts Like a Rogue

　　[Xinhua News Agency, August 24th] "Tonight" reporter Bei Que Di reported from Kaesong on the 23rd: Over ten thousand eyewitnesses in Kaesong unanimously point to U.S. Air Force Colonel Kenny as a liar. All the residents of this "neutral" city heard the sound of aircraft, exploding bombs, and machine-gun fire last night. Several thousand people, like me, saw the firelight from the napalm bombs and the tracer bullets from the machine guns. But Colonel Kenny refused to talk to these people. Because I wanted to give him a piece of evidence, he "ordered" me to leave this area, over which he and other Americans had no control, and then he demanded an end to the investigation. Kenny refused to examine the bomb tail fins still in the bomb craters, nor would he look at the napalm bomb fragments. With some rude, abusive, and arrogant words, he completely refused a joint investigation and got into his car to return to his base to fabricate his report full of words like "no air raid, no aircraft, fabrication." When the North Korean liaison officer called Kenny last night, his initial response was: "How many casualties?" Then he refused to come to Kaesong. It was only when the North Korean liaison officer pointed out that Kenny would be personally responsible if he did not participate in the investigation that he agreed to come. Later, he even tried to stop the investigation. After the North Korean liaison officer discovered two more napalm bombs, one of which was unexploded, he rushed to chase him and insisted for half an hour before Kenny agreed to return. He displayed a dismissive attitude towards many witnesses, deliberately distorting the witnesses' accounts of the bombing. He even asked a group of Koreans (most of whom had relatives who died in the U.S. aircraft bombing atrocity): "Has anyone here seen an airplane drop bombs?" This shows how cunning his methods are. It is solemnly believed here that this incident is a "deliberate provocation" aimed at undermining the peace talks.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, August 24th] French Paris "Tonight" reporter Bei Que Di reported from Kaesong on the 23rd that the astonishing behavior of U.S. liaison officer Air Force Colonel Kenny and Marine Corps Colonel Mulay after the U.S. aircraft bombing and strafing of Kaesong last night was almost as unreasonable as the air raid itself. All the residents of Kaesong, including reporters, heard the sound of low-flying, circling aircraft, saw the firelight of bombs, and heard explosions, as well as the aircraft circling a second time, diving, and strafing. Every step was a struggle to get the Americans to look at the evidence. They initially refused to come at all, and later mocked every piece of evidence, such as bomb craters and napalm bomb fragments. They suddenly stopped the investigation halfway, dismissed General Nam Il's verbal protest as "not worth a laugh," and returned to their camp. Korean and Chinese liaison officers caught up with them, brought them back, and insisted that they look at some more evidence, including an unexploded, intact napalm bomb. At this time, Kenny refused to continue looking at the evidence, saying: "It's raining, let's stop this investigation!"

　　[Xinhua News Agency, August 24th] Hungarian "Free People's Daily" reporter Mi Lai Yi reported from Kaesong on the 23rd: Less than three days after murdering the Chinese military police platoon leader, the U.S. shamelessly violated the agreement on the neutralization of Kaesong by bombing Kaesong on Wednesday night.

　　On the morning of the 22nd, a low-flying U.S. aircraft had already flown over the neutral zone. In the afternoon, we saw nine aircraft flying over. At night, we heard the sound of low-flying aircraft, followed by the sound of exploding bombs. The aircraft returned, circling over our heads, and then dived and strafed the headquarters of the Korean and Chinese delegation. Kaesong's neutral zone had no blackout precautions, and within minutes, Kaesong became like a city on the front lines.

　　Korean and Chinese liaison officers immediately notified the U.S. side to send personnel to Kaesong for a formal investigation. At a few minutes before one o'clock, U.S. Colonel Mulay and Colonel Kenny arrived at the scene. These two had shown Nazi-like brutality in the murder of the Chinese military police platoon leader. It soon became clear that in terms of brutality and deceit, Mulay was only a novice compared to Kenny.

　　When the Korean and Chinese liaison officers began the investigation, they placed a piece of shrapnel on the table, which had landed on General Nam Il's jeep in front of the Korean and Chinese delegation headquarters. The liaison officers of both sides began the investigation after two or three sentences of conversation. In one place, there was a new bomb crater, and napalm bomb fragments remained in the crater. However, liar Kenny stood next to the bomb crater and said, "This was not bombed by a bomb." Later, when new evidence was seen—bombs had landed on the rocky mountain—he seemed unwilling to even look at it. He kept saying to Mulay, "Okay, Sim, let's go back."

　　法国今晚报记者等报道
    调查美机炸开城暴行
    美方联络官竟耍无赖
    【新华社二十四日讯】今晚报记者贝却敌二十三日自开城报道：开城一万多个目击者齐指美国空军上校肯尼为说谎家。这个“中立”城的全体居民昨晚都听到飞机的声音，炸弹爆发和机枪扫射的声音。好几千人都像我一样看见汽油弹的火光和机枪发出的曳光弹。但是肯尼上校却拒绝和这些人谈话。因为我曾要给他一块证物，他“命令”我离开这块他和其他的美国人都毫无控制权的地区，于是他就要求结束调查。肯尼拒绝检验仍然还在炸弹坑里的炸弹尾翅，也不肯看一看汽油弹的弹片。他以一些蛮横，谩骂和傲慢的言词完全拒绝双方调查后，就坐上车子回他的基地去制造他那充满着“没有空袭，没有飞机，无中生有”这类话的报告去了。昨晚北朝鲜联络官打电话给肯尼的时候，他最初的回答是：“有多少死伤”，然后又拒绝来开城。直到北朝鲜联络官指出如果不来参加调查，肯尼个人要负责任时才答应来，后来他又曾设法中止调查。北朝鲜联络官又发现了两枚汽油弹，其中有一枚是未爆炸的之后，赶去追他，一直坚持了半小时，肯尼才同意回来。他对许多的见证都摆出不屑一顾的样子，故意歪曲证人报告轰炸经过时说的话。他竟问一群朝鲜人（他们大多数人都有亲人死在美机轰炸暴行之下）说：“这儿有谁见过飞机投炸弹吗？”这种话说明了他的手段是多么诡诈。这里都郑重地认为这次事件是“有目的的蓄意挑衅”，以破坏和谈。
    【新华社二十四日讯】法国巴黎《今晚报》记者贝却敌二十三日自开城报道称：美国飞机昨晚轰炸扫射开城之后，美方联络官空军上校肯尼与陆战队上校穆莱所表现的惊人的行为，几乎就像空袭事件本身一样蛮不讲理。全体开城居民，包括记者在内，都听到低飞盘旋的飞机声，看见炸弹的火光，听到爆炸声、飞机第二次盘旋、俯冲并扫射。要美国人去看物证的时候，每一步都得拖着走才行。他们起初根本拒绝来，后来是对每一个物证，像炸弹坑、汽油弹弹片，都加以嘲笑。他们在半途突然中止了调查，把南日将军的口头抗议称为“不值一笑”，就回到他们的行营去了。朝、中联络官追上他们，带他们回头，一定要他们再看一些物证，包括一颗未爆炸的完整的汽油弹。这时，肯尼拒绝再继续看物证，他说：“天在下雨，我们停止这个调查吧！”
    【新华社二十四日讯】匈牙利《自由人民报》记者米赖依二十三日自开城报道：在杀害了中国军事警察排长之后不到三天，美方又无耻地破坏关于开城中立化的协议，在星期三夜里，轰炸开城。
    在二十二日上午，已经有低飞美机一架飞过中立区。下午，我们看见飞机九架飞过。夜里听到飞机低飞的声音，随即听到炸弹的爆炸声。飞机回来在我们头上绕圈飞行，随即向朝、中代表团总部方面俯冲扫射。开城中立区没有灯火管制的预防措施，数分钟后，开城就变成一个像在前线的城市了。
    朝、中联络官立即通知美方派员来开城作正式调查。在一时差几分的时候，美方穆莱上校和肯尼上校到达出事地点，他们两个人在杀害中国军事警察排长的事件上，曾显示出像纳粹一样蛮横。不久之后就看得很清楚，在蛮横和欺骗方面，和肯尼比较起来，穆莱还只算是个生手。
    朝、中联络官开始调查时即把拾得的一块弹片放在桌上，这块弹片是落在朝、中代表团总部前面的南日将军的吉普车上的。双方联络官在交谈了两三句话之后，就开始调查。在一个地方有一个新的炸弹坑，坑内还留着汽油弹的弹片。可是，说谎大王肯尼站在炸弹坑旁边说：“这不是炸弹炸的。”随后看到了新的证据——炸弹落在岩山上，他显得看都不愿看一下的样子。他对穆莱不断地说：“好了，希姆，让我们回去吧。”
