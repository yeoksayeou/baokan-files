　　The Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau Possesses a Purely Profit-Driven Viewpoint

　　Seriously Affecting Pit Prop Supply to Some Coal Mines in North and East China

    The Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau, neglecting the needs of national industrial construction, has demonstrated a serious purely profit-driven viewpoint and a localized perspective in supplying pit props to state-owned coal mines in North and East China, causing some coal mines to nearly shut down due to the lack of pit prop supplies. According to the unified timber allocation plan of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, the pit props needed by state-owned coal mines in North and East China in 1951 were to be mainly supplied by Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. Among them, Hunan Province should supply 48.57 percent. However, to date, the Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau has not yet supplied one-third of the delivery tasks stipulated in the contract. The main reason is that the bureau wants to gain more profits from timber allocation. Regarding this point, in addition to some materials already reported in this newspaper on August 19, it can be further proven by the following facts:

    According to the timber allocation contract signed by the bureau and the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, it is stipulated that the delivery price of each cubic meter of wood along the Yuehan Railway is 420,000 yuan, which is at least 200,000 yuan higher than the bureau's purchase price at various stations along the Yuehan Railway. For example, the purchase price of pit props at the four stations of Linxiang, Yanglousi, Lukoupu, and Yunxi along the Yuehan Railway is 220,000 yuan per cubic meter, and the purchase price at Dengjiatang Station is 143,250 yuan per cubic meter. The purchase prices at stations such as Leiyang and Qifengdu are even lower. This means that the bureau buys wood from farmers at low prices and sells it to the state. In one transaction, it has already earned a profit of more than 100 percent. However, the bureau is not satisfied and demands an additional 15 percent of afforestation fees on top of the allocation price. According to regulations, the afforestation fee is a fee paid by the logging organization (forestry production organization) when felling state-owned forests and should be included in the cost and should be included in the allocation price. It shall not be collected separately from the timber-consuming departments. Therefore, the bureau's collection of afforestation fees is unreasonable and is actually a disguised increase in the allocation price. Collecting afforestation fees from the Ministry of Fuel Industry will inevitably affect industrial costs. Regarding the afforestation fee issue, the Ministry of Fuel Industry has requested the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council to add it, and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council has repeatedly notified that the afforestation fee has been included in the allocation price. However, the bureau still insists that if the timber-consuming department does not pay the afforestation fee, it will not issue a timber exit permit. From April this year to the present, after several negotiations, the result was still that a note of debt was issued before the exit permit was issued, and the afforestation fee issue was finally not resolved.

    In addition, on the issue of delivery locations, the bureau, in order to achieve the purpose of increasing some transportation costs, does not provide the material-demanding department with transportation convenience. In principle, the delivery location should be at railway stations along the railway line, or at least on the big river in Dongjiang, upstream of the Lei River. In this way, the Ministry of Fuel Industry can find a way to transport the wood out. However, the bureau, on the pretext that the contract did not clearly stipulate it (the contract stipulates that the pit props to be delivered in the second and third phases should be delivered on the banks of "big rivers" and at various stations along the Xianggui and Yuehan lines, without specifying where the big rivers are), concentrated two-thirds of the total amount of pit props to be delivered in the second and third quarters in riverbanks that are very close to the logging site and have extremely inconvenient transportation. In addition, the pit props are short and cannot be tied into rafts. Generally, they should be attached to fir rafts in order to be floated down. The bureau controls all the long fir poles used for tying rafts and has the ability and means to be responsible for tying rafts. However, the bureau does not do this and pushes the responsibility of tying rafts to the material-demanding department; and repeatedly urges by telegram, "If you don't take delivery again, we will not be responsible." In fact, the bureau wants the material-demanding department to increase some transportation costs before transporting it to a location with convenient transportation. Due to the above reasons, a large number of pit props allocated by the Ministry of Fuel Industry are still stockpiled in Hunan Province, and the production of some state-owned coal mines has encountered great difficulties due to the lack of pit props. The Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau urgently needs to conduct a profound review of its profit-driven viewpoint and localized viewpoint that lacks a national concept, and should immediately correct it in practical actions.

### 湖南省林业局存在单纯营利观点  使华北华东一些煤矿的坑木供应受到严重影响

　　湖南省林业局存在单纯营利观点
    使华北华东一些煤矿的坑木供应受到严重影响
    湖南省林业局忽视国家工业建设的需要，在供应华北、华东国营煤矿坑木的问题上，表现出严重的单纯营利观点和局部观点，使一些煤矿因得不到坑木的供应而将近停工。依据政务院财政经济委员会木材统一调拨计划，华北、华东各国营煤矿一九五一年需用的坑木，主要由江西及湖南两省供应。其中湖南省应供应百分之四十八点五七。但到目前为止，湖南省林业局尚未供应到合同规定交货任务的三分之一。主要原因是该局想在调拨木材中多得利润。关于这一点，除本报八月十九日已报道的一些材料之外，从下面的事实更可以证明：
    根据该林业局与中央人民政府燃料工业部所订的调拨木材合同，规定每立方公尺木材在粤汉铁路沿线交货，调拨价为四十二万元，这比该林业局在粤汉沿线各车站收购价最少已高出二十万元，如该局在粤汉沿线临湘、羊楼司、路口铺、云溪四处车站收购坑木每立方公尺价格为二十二万元，在邓家塘车站收购，每立方公尺为十四万三千二百五十元。在耒阳、栖凤渡等车站收购价格更低。这就是说，该局用低价收购农民的木材卖给国家，一转手之间，已赚到百分之百以上的厚利。但该局还不满足，还要在调拨价之外要求增加百分之十五的育林费。按育林费系砍伐国有林时，由砍伐机关（林业生产机关）上缴的费用，理应计算在成本以内，并应包括在调拨价格之内，不得向用材部门另行征收。因此，该局征收育林费是不合理的，实际是变象提高调拨价格。对燃料工业部征收育林费，实际上必然影响工业成本。关于育林费问题，燃料工业部曾呈请政务院财政经济委员会追加，政务院财政经济委员会已一再通知育林费已包括在调拨价格之内。但该局仍坚持如用材部门不缴育林费，则不发给木材出境证。自今年四月至目前为止，经数度交涉，结果还是开了欠款条子才发给出境证，育林费问题终于还是没有解决。
    此外，在交货地点的问题上，该局为了达到再增加一些运费的目的，不给需材部门以运输上的便利。照理交货地点应在铁路沿线车站，至少应在耒水上游东江地方的大河边。这样，燃料工业部才有办法将木材运出。但该局借口合同上没有明确规定（按合同中规定二、三期应交坑木在“大河”边及湘桂、粤汉沿线各车站交货，未注明何处的大河边），竟将占二、三两季应交付的坑木总数三分之二的木材集中在离采伐地点很近而交通极不方便的河边。加以坑木材短，不能扎簰，一般应附于杉簰上，才能流放下来。该局掌握全部扎簰用的杉木长杆，有能力有办法负责扎簰。但该局并不这样作，把扎簰责任推到需材部门身上；并一再电催“再不点收，我们就不负责任”。实际上该局是想要需材部门再增加一些运费，才给运至交通方便的地点。由于以上原因，以致燃料工业部调拨的大批坑木现仍积存在湖南省境内，而一些国营煤矿的生产已因缺乏坑木而发生极大困难。湖南省林业局亟应对自己此种缺乏国家观念的营利观点与局部观点进行深刻检讨，并应立即在实际行动上加以纠正。
