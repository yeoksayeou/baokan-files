　　French "Ce Soir" Reporter
    Exposes Joy's Continued Double-Dealing
    [Xinhua News Agency, 14th] "Ce Soir" newspaper reporter Béquet reported from Kaesong: At the Korean armistice talks meeting on the 13th, Joy, in answering General Nam Il's question raised on Sunday, admitted that the U.S. side wanted to draw the military demarcation line deep inside North Korea. This point, as usual, was deleted from Ridgway's communique. Joy is still continuing to play the trick of one set at the meeting and another set in the newspapers, and trying to create an excuse for his absurd demands. At the meeting, Joy clearly said: "Simply put, starting from the existing ground positions, the demilitarized zone and the resulting military demarcation line should be adjusted northward to ensure that the UN forces' defensive positions have adequate depth." This absurd proposition that the entire buffer zone must be drawn in North Korean territory has been completely rejected by the Korean and Chinese sides. Despite the insistence of the reporters approved by Ridgway to publish this absurd proposition, the US side refused to do so. In this case, even discussing the issue of "adjustment" is impossible. The current situation of the negotiations is actually this: The U.S. side says: "Well, how much of your territory are you willing to give us at no cost?" If you want to bargain, the only way is: The Korean side demanded that the boundary line be drawn far south of the 38th parallel, based on the fact that the guerrillas in the south are capable of blowing up bridges anywhere between Seoul and Busan. But they stick to their original demand as a prerequisite for starting negotiations - that the 38th parallel should be the dividing line. In order to evade the consequences of deceiving the public on the issue of the military demarcation line, the U.S. side wants to shelve the second item on the agenda and discuss other agendas, which General Nam Il has resolutely rejected. The representatives of the Korean and Chinese people are patient. Their attitude is reasonable. They will not be forced to accept unjust demands; no matter what deceptive and intimidating tactics are used by Tokyo and Washington.

　　法国今晚报记者
    揭露乔埃继续玩弄两面手法
    【新华社十四日讯】法国巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌自开城报道：在十三日的朝鲜停战谈判会议上，乔埃在答复南日将军于星期日提出的问题时承认，美方想在深入北朝鲜的地方划分军事分界线。这一点，在李奇微的公报上照常被删掉了。乔埃仍继续玩弄会上一套，报纸上发表另一套的手法，并企图为他的荒谬的要求制造口实。在会议上乔埃明白地说：“简单说来，以现有地面阵地作为起点，而将非军事地区及由此而来的军事分界线向北方调整，以保证联合国军防御阵地得具有适当的深度。”整个缓冲区必须划在北朝鲜境内这种荒唐的主张，已被朝鲜和中国方面完全拒绝。尽管为李奇微所核准了的记者们坚请公布这个荒唐的主张，但美方仍加以拒绝。在这种情况下，甚至讨论“调整”的问题都是不可能的。目前谈判的情况其实是这样的：美方说：“好吧，你们的领土愿意无代价地让给我们多少呢？”如果要还价的话，唯一的办法就是：朝鲜方面要求远在三八线以南的地方划界线，根据是在南部的游击队是有能力在从汉城到釜山之间的任何地方炸毁桥梁的。但是他们坚守自己原来的作为开始谈判的先决条件的要求——应以三八线为分界线。美方为了规避他们在军事分界线问题上欺骗公众的后果，想要搁置议程第二项而讨论其他议程，南日将军已坚决予以拒绝。朝鲜人和中国人的代表是耐心的。他们的态度是合理的。他们是不会受人逼迫而接受不公正的要求的；不论东京和华盛顿方面使用什么欺骗、恫吓手段。
