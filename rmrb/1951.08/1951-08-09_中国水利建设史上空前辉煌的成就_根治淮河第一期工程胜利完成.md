An Unprecedented and Brilliant Achievement in China's Water Conservancy Construction History
    The First Phase of the Huai River Harnessing Project Successfully Completed

    The first phase of the Huai River harnessing project, which began construction at the end of November last year, was fully completed in late July this year. From now on, the 55 million people in the Huai River basin have begun to break away from the disaster of "major disasters with heavy rain, minor disasters with light rain" that has plagued them for many years, and have seen a happy future.

    This first phase of the Huai River harnessing project was carried out in accordance with the "combining storage and drainage" policy of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council for the Huai River. In the upper reaches of the Huai River in Henan Province, the main focus was on constructing valley reservoirs and depression storage projects; the second priority was to dredge and reorganize more than 20 main and tributary rivers in the upper reaches of the Huai River, focusing on rivers such as the Hong River, Ru River, and Ying River; at the same time, check dams were built in areas such as Yiyang and Biyang to conserve water and soil. In the central reaches of the Huai River in northern Anhui Province, the main focus was on building a large diversion gate at Runheji to control the floodwaters of the main stream of the Huai River; the second priority was to reinforce the dikes of the main river and important tributaries of the Huai River, and to dredge important tributaries such as the Sui River and the West Fei River. In the lower reaches of the Huai River in northern Jiangsu Province, the main content of this phase of the project was to reinforce the dikes of the Grand Canal. In order to alleviate waterlogging disasters, various places along the Huai River in Henan and northern Anhui provinces have planned and opened many ditches. In total, this phase of the project completed approximately 195 million cubic meters of earthwork for storage, dike restoration, dredging, and ditches (including approximately 100 million cubic meters of earthwork for ditches), one Shimantan valley reservoir, parts of the Banqiao and Baisha valley reservoirs, one Runheji flood storage diversion gate, 62 other large and small culverts, and 155 check dams.

    The completion of the above series of projects has changed the history of the Huai River from now on. Since the 14th century, the Huai River has experienced 70 major and minor floods every century, and this long and tragic history has come to an end. In the past, the Huai River basin suffered from "major disasters with heavy rain, minor disasters with light rain." After this phase of rectification, it can generally achieve the goal of "reducing disasters with heavy rain, avoiding disasters with light rain." Even if a flood as large as that in 1950 occurs, it can still guarantee that 17 million mu of land will no longer be affected by disasters or will have disasters reduced.

    This phase of the project covered 13 special districts, two cities, and 48 counties in the three provinces of Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu. A total of 3 million migrant workers were mobilized, and more than 10,000 engineering and technical personnel from all over the country participated in the work. Such a large-scale Huai River harnessing project was finally completed in a short period of eight months. This is an unprecedented and brilliant achievement in the history of China's water conservancy construction. This phase of the project has provided valuable experience in terms of migrant worker mobilization and organization, project leadership, and construction, laying the foundation for future large-scale Huai River harnessing projects.

### 中国水利建设史上空前辉煌的成就  根治淮河第一期工程胜利完成

　　中国水利建设史上空前辉煌的成就
    根治淮河第一期工程胜利完成
    根治淮河的第一期工程，自去年十一月底动工到今年七月下旬已经全部完成。从此，淮河流域五千五百万人民开始摆脱了多年来“大雨大灾，小雨小灾”的灾难，看到了幸福的远景。
    这一期治淮工程是根据中央人民政府政务院“蓄泄兼筹”的治淮方针进行的。在淮河上游河南境内主要是修建山谷水库和洼地蓄洪工程；其次是以洪河、汝河、颍河等河为重点将淮河上游二十余条干支河加以疏浚和整理；同时还在伊阳、泌阳等地建造谷坊，以保持水土。在淮河中游皖北境内，主要是在润河集建造一座控制淮河干流洪水的大分水闸，其次是培修淮河干河和重要支河的堤防，疏浚濉河和西肥河等重要支河。在淮河下游苏北境内，这期工程内容主要是培修运河堤防。为了减轻内涝灾害，河南、皖北两省区沿淮河各地都曾有计划地开了许多沟洫。总计这期工程共完成了蓄洪、复堤、疏浚、沟洫等土方工程约一亿九千五百万公方（其中沟洫工程土工约一亿公方），石漫滩山谷水库一座、板桥、白沙两处山谷水库的一部分，润河集蓄洪分水闸一座，其他大小涵闸六十二处，谷坊一百五十五座。
    上述一系列工程的完成，使淮河的历史从此改变。自十四世纪以来淮河每百年要发生七十次大小水灾，这一段长期的悲惨的历史从此结束了。从前淮河流域是“大雨大灾，小雨小灾”，经过这一期整治之后，一般已可达到“大雨减灾，小雨免灾”的目的。即使遇到一九五○年那样大的洪水时，仍可保证一千七百万亩土地不再遭灾或减灾。
    这期工程地区遍及河南、皖北、苏北三个省区中的十三个专区、两个市和四十八个县，先后共动员民工达三百万人，来自全国各地参加工作的工程技术人员在一万人以上。这样大规模的治淮工程，终于能在短短的八个月内完成，这是中国水利建设史上空前辉煌的成就。这一期工程，无论在民工的动员组织工作方面、工程领导方面，以及施工方面，都提供了不少宝贵的经验，为今后大规模的治淮工程奠定了基础。
