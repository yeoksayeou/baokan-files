Eleventh Section  Classical Chinese Empty Words

	A few general remarks.  This final section discusses several empty words inherited from classical Chinese that are still commonly used today.  These empty words appear in modern articles in four situations.  (1) Idiomatic, meaning they have become constituent parts of certain words and phrases, such as the "yi" in "yiqian" (before) and the "zhi" in "zhishang" (above).  In themselves, they are classical Chinese words; regarding the entire word or phrase, they are unquestionably modern language. We do not analyze these words and phrases when we learn them, and after learning them, the question of whether the empty words inside are used correctly will not arise.  (2) There are no suitable words to replace them in modern language, such as the "er" in "yonggan er jizhi" (brave and resourceful).  The use of classical Chinese empty words in this way is necessary.  (3) There are suitable words available in modern language, but a classical Chinese empty word is used, such as the "zhi" in "jujue gongren zhi heli jianyi" ("reject the reasonable suggestions of workers") (newspaper). This is unnecessary and best avoided, although grammatically speaking in classical Chinese, this "zhi" is acceptable. (4) It is not only unnecessary but also grammatically incorrect even in classical Chinese, such as the "yi" in "zai Meiguo, yi yuanzineng bianchengle zhadan" ("in America, atomic energy was made into bombs") (journal). This is absolutely unacceptable.

	The ten or so commonly used empty words in classical Chinese have varied and complex usages, and it is impossible to explain them in detail within this limited space.  If readers feel the need, they can find a book on classical Chinese empty words to read, such as Liu Qi's "Zhuzi Bianlüe" (Helper Word Discernment) (Kaiming), Yang Shuda's "Ciquan" (Word Interpretation) (Commercial Press), and Lü Shuxiang's "Wenyan Xuzi" (Classical Chinese Empty Words) (Kaiming). We do not encourage readers to overuse classical Chinese empty words; on the contrary, we want to advise everyone to use fewer classical Chinese empty words, not to use them when unnecessary, and not to use them when you are not confident about using them correctly.

	Zhi. The commonly used "zhi" has two meanings: First, equivalent to "de" (of); second, equivalent to "ta" (he/she/it) (people, things, singular, plural). Saying "equivalent" does not mean they can be arbitrarily replaced; their usages are not entirely consistent. Many words and phrases contain "zhi," among which those equivalent to "de" include:

	(1) zhishang (above), zhixia (below), zhizhong (within), zhinei (inside), zhiwai (outside), zhijian (between), zhiqian (before), zhihou (after); sanfen zhi yi (one-third), baifen zhi wu (five percent), yuanyin zhi yi (one of the reasons), ...zhilei (...and so on); sannian zhi jiu (three years long), wuwanwan zhi duo (as many as 500 million), feichang zhi xiao (extremely small); yiji zhi chang (a special skill), yikong zhi jian (a narrow view); weihai zhi da (the great harm), yingxiang zhi shen (the deep impact). Those equivalent to "ta" include:

	(2) zongzhi (in short), jia zhi (in addition), jiao zhi (compared to); yanzhi wuwu (empty words), guwang yanzhi (just saying), zongeryanzhi (in conclusion); zhizhi buli (ignore it), qu er dai zhi (replace it), fen er zhi zhi (divide and conquer it).

	These are examples of use in existing words and phrases. The freely used "zhi," acting as "de," is still often seen in modern articles, while acting as "ta" is rare. Neither of these "zhi" characters is necessary. Below are examples of improper use:

	(3) Dui gongren tichu de youguan anquan wenti de yijian, ting zhi ren zhi, zhi zhi bugu. (book) (For the opinions raised by the workers regarding safety problems, to listen to them and let them be, to ignore them.)
	(4) Weile tuanjie yu fahui guangda renmin qunzhong de jiji xing, chuangzao xing, bing shi zhi yizhi xingdong qilai... (book) (In order to unite and bring into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of people, and to make them act in unison...)
	(5) Ni chu suo yao cailiao, cha yijing yu zhi song qu. (jian) (The materials you requested have been checked and sent to you.) (3) "Zhizhi bugu" is not as ready-made as "zhizhi buli," and "ting zhi ren zhi" is newly created. In fact, it is enough to say "yidian bu li hui" (not to pay attention at all). (4) Change "zhi" to "tamen" (them). (5) "Yu zhi song qu" is not only a mixture of classical and modern Chinese, but also "zhi" cannot refer to "ni chu" (your place). "Yijing song qu" (already sent) is so straightforward!

	Qi. "Qi" also has two meanings: first, "na" (that); second, "tade" (his/her/its), "××de" (××'s). The former is now only seen in a few words such as "qita" (other), "qiyu" (the rest), "qici" (secondly), while the latter is like:

	(6) qizhong (among them), qishi (actually); zhizhi qi yi, buzhi qi er (knowing only one, not knowing two); jiqi (extremely), youqi (especially), heqi (how); mingfu qishi (the name matches the reality); momo qi miao (inexplicable); kuakua qitan (boasting); bucheng qi wei shi (not up to poetry).

	The freely used "qi" is also commonly seen, such as "qi yuanyin" (the reason), "qi mudi" (the purpose), "you qi yiyi" (have its meaning), "qiu qi jizao shixian" (seek its early realization), "jiechu qi wuzhuang" (disarm them), "diguozhuyi ji qi zougou" (imperialism and its running dogs). These are fairly ready-made, but it is not necessary to use "qi." As for the following sentences, using "qi" as "ta" is completely wrong.

	(7) Dangshi you Du Fengxu tongzhi shangqian gei qi jieshi. (xin) (At that time, Comrade Du Fengxu stepped forward to explain to them.)
	(8) Dan dang qi ziji shibai weiji de shihou, que you hui zhuangmo zuoyang pianqu chuanxi de jihui. (qi) (But when they themselves fail and are in danger, they will pretend and try to deceive in order to gain a chance to breathe.)
	(9) You de jishu renyuan shenzhi zhuzhang "yao bengluo huanying ta bengluo, bengluo le, women jiang qi zhuang zou, shengde fangpao." (shu) (Some technicians even advocate, "If it's going to collapse, welcome it to collapse. If it collapses, we'll load it up and take it away, saving the need to blast it.")

	Suo. "Suo" itself does not have much meaning. In classical Chinese, "suo" added before a transitive verb indicates the passive object; "suo jian" is equivalent to "kanjian de" (what is seen) or "kanjian de dongxi" (the thing seen). If there is a noun or pronoun before "suo," it must be the subject of the verb after "suo," such as "wo suo jian" (what I saw). In modern Chinese, it is most commonly seen in the passive forms "wei...suo" and "bei...suo." It is also seen in some idioms, such as:

	(10) suode (income), suode shui (income tax), suoyou (all), suoyou quan (ownership), suozaI (location), suowei (so-called); yousuo... (have something...), wusuo... (have nothing...), hesuo... (what...).

	In the articles of modern people, the "suo" is used incorrectly too often. I can only give a few examples:

	(11) "Qiang niu de gua butian" zhi suoyi wei duzhe suo ganjue qinqie... (qi) ("Forcibly twisted melon is not sweet" is why readers feel close to it...)
	(12) Tamen de zuopin bu dan zai jiefangqu hen shou huanying, zai jiefangqu wai ye shou hen duo de renshi suo xihuan. (qi) (Their works are not only very popular in the liberated areas, but also liked by many people outside the liberated areas.)
	(13) Woguo dabu meikuang guoqu shi you diguozhuyi he guanliao ziben zhuyi suo jingying de. (shu) (In the past, most of China's coal mines were operated by imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism.)
	(14) Xianzai shijie shang zhuyao de chan cha guojia ru Yindu, Xilan, Yinni (Zhuawa), Riben deng guo suo zhong chashu, mo bu you Zhongguo suo yizhi. (bao) (The tea trees planted in major tea-producing countries in the world, such as India, Ceylon, Indonesia (Java), and Japan, were all transplanted from China.)
	(15) Jinjin cong yijiujiu ling -- yijiujiu yi wo zai Xianggang yu Xu xiansheng suo jiechu de na yiduan, jiu yijing shi wo juede zhe duanduan shiliu pian dongxi shizai buzuyi shuoming zhe wei zuozhe de jindu. (bao) (Just from the period from 1940 to 1941 when I was in Hong Kong and came into contact with Mr. Xu, I already felt that these short sixteen articles were really not enough to explain the author's progress.)
	(16) Lingdao jiguan ceng dali jiuzheng zai ganbu zhong suo cunzaizhe de "heping tugai" sixiang. (qi) (The leading organs have vigorously corrected the "peaceful land reform" ideology that exists among cadres.)
	(17) Shi Mao Zedong shidai de qingnian suo zui yao budede taidu. (qi) (It is the attitude that young people in the Mao Zedong era must not have.)
	(18) Zhe wenti shi zhide women qi wei nu tongxue suo zhongshi de. (zuo) (This problem is worth the attention of our seven female classmates.)
	(19) Zhi xiangdao ben danwei de xuyao, mei xiangdao yinci er shi guojia suo zaoshou de sunshi. (shu) (Only thought of the needs of this unit, did not think of the losses suffered by the country as a result.) (11) "Wei...suo ganjue" is correct, but adding a supplementary appositive "qinqie" afterwards is not allowed by this format. Removing "suo" and changing "wei" to "bei" is better, but it is not as good as saying "...zhi suoyi neng shi duzhe juede qinqie" (...is why it can make readers feel close). (12)'s "shou" (receive) and (13)'s "you" (by) are different from "wei" and "bei" and cannot use "suo." (12) can change the second "shou" to "wei," and (13) should remove "suo." (14)'s "you" indicates the source of the object, not the actor, and cannot use "suo" afterwards. (15)'s "na yiduan" (that period) is not the object of "jiechu" (contact), let alone the object of "wo yu Xu xiansheng jiechu" (my contact with Mr. Xu), and cannot add "suo" before it. (16)'s "cunzai" (exist) is an intransitive verb, and (17)'s "yao budede" (must not have) has the function of an adjective, and cannot add "suo" before it. (18)'s "nu tongxue suo zhongshi" (the female students value) and (19)'s "guojia suo zaoshou de sunshi" (the losses suffered by the country) are both correct, but it won't work after "zhide" (worth) and "shi" (make), and the "suo" must be removed.

	Suoyi. There is no saying of "yinwei...suoyi..." (because...therefore...) in classical Chinese, only "...zhi suoyi..." is used to raise a fact that needs to be explained, and the reason for this event is explained below. This sentence structure is often seen in modern articles, such as:

	(20) Zichanjieji suoyi bu huanying zhe yitiao zhenli, shi yinwei tamen bu yuanyi bei renmen tuifan. (Mao) (The reason why the bourgeoisie does not welcome this truth is because they do not want to be overthrown by the people.) But it is also often used improperly, such as:

	(21) Bulun gudian he xiandai zuopin, qi suoyi chengwei yi ben shu, bushi shuo chengwei mingzhu le, wenzhang duanwu butong zhi li. (qi) (Whether it is classical or modern works, since it can become a book, let alone a masterpiece, there is no reason why the article should not be clear.) It should be said "jiran neng chengwei yi ben shu" (since it can become a book).

	Er. "Er" is the most commonly used conjunction in classical Chinese. It can be used to connect two opposite meanings, it can also be used to connect two similar meanings, it can be used to connect two equal components, and it can be used to connect an additional component and a component being added to. Modern language does lack a conjunction equivalent to it, so it is sometimes very necessary. But it is not omnipotent, and there are some places where it cannot be used. When we measure the "er" in modern articles, on the one hand, we must ask, if this sentence is in classical Chinese, can "er" be used here? On the other hand, we must see, according to modern habits, is a conjunction needed here? For example:

	(22) Women yijing quzhu le Mei diguozhuyi shili chu dalu, er ta reng bu ganxin. (qi) (We have already driven the forces of American imperialism out of the mainland, but it is still unwilling.)
	(23) Shang you kechang ceng zai jiefangqian "weifeng linlin, gao gao zai shang", tanwu, yapo gongren, er zhijin reng wei gongren suo buman. (shu) (There are still section chiefs who were "imposing and high above" before liberation, corrupt, oppressing workers, and are still dissatisfied by workers to this day.)
	(24) Biru shangji tichu peibei ganbu shi, er jiu an shu cou shang, que buguan zhiliang zenmeyang. (qi) (For example, when superiors propose to allocate cadres, they just make it up according to the number, regardless of the quality.)
	(25) Jishi jiu sixiang ouer mao chulai, qiya le gongren, er gongrenmen ye jue buhui renwei ta de qiya xingwei jiu shi changfang de yisi. (qi) (Even if old ideas occasionally emerge and oppress the workers, the workers will never think that his oppressive behavior is the factory's intention.)
	(26) Xianzai zheng shi Yingguo wuji de shijie, er jintian bai zai Yingguo renmin mianqian de renwu shi xiang wu yiyang de chenzhong. (qi) (Now is the season of fog in England, and the task before the British people today is as heavy as fog.) The "er" cannot be used in these sentences in classical Chinese. After reading sentence (22), the general response is: "You drove it out, of course it is unwilling, how can you say 'er ta reng bu ganxin'?" Because there is a causal relationship between these two clauses, and "er" cannot express this relationship. On the contrary, if "ta juran ganxin" (it was surprisingly willing), then "er" can be used to connect them. The situation is the same in (23). (24) is a temporal relationship, (25) is a hypothesis, (26) is a metaphor, and these are not within the scope of "er." (Compare examples 7 and 8 in the tenth paragraph for example (25).) The "er" in these five sentences should be removed. (22) should be changed to "Women ba...quzhu chu dalu, ta ziran bu ganxin" (We drove...out of the mainland, and it is naturally unwilling). (26) should add a "ye" (also) after "renwu" (task).

	(27) "Liangjia Chun" shi genju Guyu de duanpian xiaoshuo "Qiang niu de gua butian" er gaibian de. (qi) ("Liangjia Chun" is adapted from Guyu's short story "Forcibly Twisted Melon Is Not Sweet".)
	(28) Bingqie yong "zai xueshu shang de chengjiu wei he jiao xue biaozhun" de liyou er jiepin le Silaifu xueyuan de Sulian shi quanwei Luo Shitan jiaoshou. (qi) (And Professor Luo Shitan, a Soviet history authority at the Slavic Academy, was dismissed on the grounds that "academic achievements did not meet teaching standards.")
	(29) Pianpian Zhongguo yuanren de huashi jiu zai yubei yun guowai de qijian er yishi le. (qi) (Unfortunately, the fossils of Peking Man were lost during the period when they were being prepared to be shipped abroad.) According to modern grammar, a conjunction is not needed between the additional component and the main verb in these three sentences, although similar situations sometimes use "er" in classical Chinese, such as "yin huo er de fu" (benefit from misfortune) and "yiri er xing qianli" (travel a thousand miles a day). (If you change "de liyou" to "wei liyou" in example (28), you can keep "er.")

	The following sentence is an example of the misuse of "er":

	(30) Guomindang fandong zhengfu lanfa zhibi, er tonghuo pengzhang, wujia bodong, er yinqi shangren touji daoba, yizhi shenghuo jiannan er min bu liaosheng, er fandongpai zhi zhi soukuo, haobu guanxin. (zuo) (The Kuomintang reactionary government issued banknotes indiscriminately, and inflation and price fluctuations occurred, which caused merchants to engage in speculation and profiteering, leading to difficult lives and people unable to make a living, and the reactionaries only knew how to exploit and did not care at all.) Four "er"s are used here. Taken separately, none of the "er"s are absolutely unusable, but how can there be a reason to use four "er"s in one sentence? The first three can be removed.

	The format "wei...er..." is very common and should be discussed here. The following three examples represent three situations:

	(31) Wei baojia weiguo er kangmei yuanchao; wei yingde heping xingfu de shenghuo er douzheng. (Fight to defend the country and resist America and aid Korea; struggle to win a peaceful and happy life.)
	(32) Wei heping xingfu de shenghuo er douzheng; wei dazhong de liyi er xisheng yiji de liyi. (Fight for a peaceful and happy life; sacrifice one's own interests for the interests of the masses.)
	(33) Wei zuguo he renmin er fuwu (qi); nonmin yinian daotou wei dizhu er laodong. (zuo) (Serve the motherland and the people; farmers work for the landlords all year round.) (31) There is a verb after "wei" (for), and "er" must be used. (32) "Er" can be omitted, but "er" is generally used more often. The "wei" in these two examples means "weile" (in order to). (33)'s "wei" means "gei" (give), and "er" cannot be used afterwards.

	Yi. In classical Chinese, the use of "yi" is more than "er." In modern articles, it can probably be divided into three categories: first, equivalent to a certain usage of "zhi"; second, used as "na" (take); third, has a certain transitional function. Examples are given separately:

	(34) yishang (above), yixia (below), yinei (within), yiwai (outside), yiqian (before), yihou (after), yiwang (in the past), yilai (since).
	(35) yi shao sheng duo (defeat more with less), yi du gong du (fight poison with poison), yi shen zuo ze (set an example); yi...ji (according to...), yi...er lun (based on...).
	(36) yiji (as well as), yizhi (to the extent that); yizhi (leading to); yiqiu (in order to seek), yiqi (in order to), yibian (so that), yibei (in order to prepare), yizi (so as to), yimian (so as to avoid), yifang (in order to prevent); yongyi (used to), jieyi (so as to).

	The first category does not need to be discussed. The examples given in the second category are examples where "yi" is in the front and the main verb is in the back. In modern Chinese, "na" cannot be said in the back. In classical Chinese, "yi" can be used in the back, such as "gei diren yi jianmie xing de daji" (give the enemy a devastating blow). It is this format that is easy to use wrong, for example:

	(37) Jizi xin nian lailin, te xiang quanshe tongzhi zhi yi zhuhe he weiwen. (qi) (On the occasion of the New Year, I would like to extend my congratulations and condolences to all comrades in the society.)
	(38) Dàngrán Yao Xianlu dui qi benshen de cuowu yinggai fu yi jida zerèn. (qi) (Of course, Yao Xianlu should bear great responsibility for his own mistakes.)
	(39) Women bixu qifa gongren qunzhong yi guojia gongkuang zhurenweng de shenfen. (shu) (We must enlighten the workers and masses with the identity of the masters of the national industrial and mining industries.) (37) imitates the format of "duiyu zhexie jiejji, bixu jianjuede haobuyouyude gei yi baohu" (for these classes, we must resolutely and without hesitation give protection), but does not know that the usage of "zhi" and "gei" are different. "Gei" takes a word referring to a person as its object; the example of using "gei yi" just now can be restored to "gei zhexie jiejji yi baohu" (give these classes protection), but (37) cannot be restored to "zhi quanshe tongzhi yi zhuhe" (extend congratulations to all comrades in the society), it can only be said "zhi zhuhe yu quanshe tongzhi" (extend congratulations to all comrades in the society). Therefore, the original "yi" in "zhi yi" should be cancelled, and "zhuhe he weiwen" (congratulations and condolences) should be the object of "zhi." (38) is a similar and more obvious mistake, and it is enough to cancel the "yi." (39) forcibly uses "yi" to express a meaning that it cannot express, and it should be said "bixu gaosu gongren qunzhong, tamen xianzai shi guojia de zhurenweng" (we must tell the workers that they are now the masters of the country). (You can't say "guojia gongkuang de zhurenweng" either, they are not the masters of factories and mines.)

	The "yi" which translates as "take" must have another verb to match it. The following two sentences do not conform to this rule, so we feel that "yi" has no place to land.

	(40) Yi wo de xiezuo jingyan, wo zhidao ba yi ge wutaiju banshang yinmu shi xiangdang kunnan de gongzuo. (qi) (Based on my writing experience, I know that putting a stage play on the screen is a fairly difficult task.)
	(41) Yi guoqu zhe duan shijian he muqian gongye zhujian jinzhan de qingxing yu weilai bi neng shixian de yi ge shengqi pengbo jingji jianshe de meili yuanjing, bujin shi ren shenke de tihui dao xin minzhu zhuyi de youyuesheng. (qi) (Based on the past period of time and the current situation of gradual industrial progress and the beautiful vision of a vigorous economic construction that will surely be realized in the future, people can't help but deeply realize the superiority of new democracy.) (40) should be "yi wo de xiezuo jingyan er lun" (in terms of my writing experience), or "genju wo de xiezuo jingyan" (according to my writing experience). (41) should add "bijiao" (compare) after "yuanjing" (vision). ("Bujin shi ren" (can't help but make people) should be "shi ren bujin" (make people can't help).)

	Most of the words and phrases in the third category express purpose. Due to space limitations, I will not discuss them here. I will only explain one point, that is, using a single "yi" can also express purpose, for example:

	(42) Shi gezhong shehui jingji chengfen zai guoying jingji lingdao zhi xia, fengong hezuo, ge de qi suo, yi cujin zhengge shehui jingji de fazhan. (gongtong gangling) (Make various social and economic components cooperate under the leadership of the state-owned economy, each in its place, so as to promote the development of the entire social economy.)

	Yi...wei. This is an extremely useful format inherited from classical Chinese. It has several meanings:

	(43) Women zai guoji shang shi shuyu yi Sulian wei shou de fan diguozhuyi zhanxian yifangmian de. (Mao) (Internationally, we belong to the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union.)
	(44) Mei diguozhuyi hai yi yijing jiefang de Zhongguo renmin wei keqi. (zuo) (American imperialism still considers the liberated Chinese people to be easily bullied.)
	(45) Mei diguozhuyi dui Yazhou ge guo renmin de qinlue youlai yijiu, er yi zhanling Riben bing zhubu bian Riben wei qi yuandong qinlue jidi yilai wei zui lougu. (bao) (American imperialism's aggression against the people of Asian countries has a long history, and it has been most blatant since occupying Japan and gradually turning Japan into its Far East aggression base.) (43)'s "yi" means "na" (take), (44) means "renwei" (think), (45) means "shu" (count) or "yaosuan" (must count) (compare "hongcha yi Qimen wei zui youming" (black tea is most famous in Qimen)). This format is used extremely frequently, and therefore often has problems. For example:

	(46) Qian dong yilu yi Zhenyuan wei zhi, Qian nan yilu yi Zhenfeng wei zhi, Qian xi yilu yi Weining wei zhi. (qi) (The Qian East road ends at Zhenyuan, the Qian South road ends at Zhenfeng, and the Qian West road ends at Weining.)
	(47) Wenhua guan xianyou gelei tushu liangwan yu ce. Qizhong yi wenyi, zhengzhi lei juduo. (qi) (The cultural center currently has more than 20,000 books of various types. Among them, literary and political books are the most.)
	(48) Zhong yan yong feiliao yi zhimabing jiao hao. (bao) (Fertilizer for growing tobacco is better with sesame cake.)
	(49) You yi zhuanyi he pohuai caichan de xianxiang, zai Sunan pubian cunzaizhe. (qi) (Especially the phenomenon of transferring and destroying property is common in southern Jiangsu.)
	(50) Bupi fangmian yi yinhua bu ji lan bu, zai Huabei, Xibei, Changjiang yidai, youyu nongcun xuqiu shen yin, suoyi dangdi shichang xiwei jun qiang. (qi) (In terms of fabrics, printed fabrics and blue fabrics are in great demand in North China, Northwest China, and the Yangtze River area due to strong rural demand, so the local market demand is strong.)
	(51) Jin nianlai, mouxie yi miaoxie duixiang de zhenshi xingming suo xie de zuopin ru "Wang Xiuluan" suoyi shoudao qunzhong de pubian huanying... (jiao) (In recent years, some works written with the real names of the descriptive objects, such as "Wang Xiuluan," are so popular with the masses...) (46) should say "dao...weizhi" (ends at...). (47) should say "yi...wei duo" (the most), or remove "yi" and leave "juduo" (the most). The remaining four sentences should all use "wei" to match "yi" but forgot to do so. (48) is "yi...wei jiao hao" (is better). (49) If you keep "yi," you must say "you yi zhuanyi he pohuai caichan wei Sunan pubian cunzai de xianxiang" (especially the transfer and destruction of property is a common phenomenon in southern Jiangsu), but it is better to change it to "youqishi" (especially). (50) "Yi...wei zui changxiao" (the best-selling). (51) "(Works) (written) with the real names of the descriptive objects as the title." The "suo" in "suo xie" is incorrect, it is better to change it to "er xie," but these two words are not needed at all.

专栏：

　　语法、修辞讲话（第三讲）
       吕叔湘　朱德熙
    第十一段  文言虚字
    总说几句。  最后这一段讲从文言里继承过来、现在还常常用到的几个虚字。这些虚字出现在现代的文章里，有四种情况。（一）熟语性的，就是说，它们已经成为某些词和短语的组成分子，例如“以前”的“以”，“之上”的“之”。就它们本身说，是文言字；就整个词语说，是无疑问的现代语。这些词语，我们学习的时候不加分析，学会之后也不会发生里面虚字用得对不对的问题。（二）现代语里没有适当的字可以替代，例如“勇敢而机智”的“而”。这样用的文言虚字是需要的。（三）现代语里有适当的字可用，但是用了一个文言虚字，例如“拒绝工人之合理建议”（报）的“之”。这是不必要的，最好不用，虽然就文言的语法说，这个“之”字是通的。（四）不但不必要，而且就文言的语法说，也是不通的，例如“在美国，以原子能变成了炸弹”（期）的“以”。这是绝对要不得的。
    文言里常用的十来个虚字，它们的用法是变化多端的，不可能在这有限的篇幅里详细说明。读者如果感觉有需要，可以找一本讲文言虚字的书来看看，例如刘淇的《助字辨略》（开明），杨树达的《词诠》（商务），吕叔湘的《文言虚字》（开明）。我们并不鼓励读者多用文言虚字；正相反，我们要劝大家少用文言虚字，不必要的时候不要用，用得对不对没有把握的时候不要用。
    之。  常用的“之”字有两个意义：一，跟“的”相当；二，跟“他”（人、物，单、复）相当。说相当，不是说可以任意替代，它们的用法并不完全一致。含有“之”字的词和短语很多，其中跟“的”相当的如：
    （一）之上，之下，之中，之内，之外，之间，之前，之后；三分之一，百分之五，原因之一，……之类；三年之久，五万万之多，非常之小；一技之长，一孔之见；为害之大，影响之深。跟“他”相当的如：
    （二）总之，加之，较之；言之无物，姑妄言之，总而言之；置之不理，取而代之，分而治之。
    这些是用在现成词语里的例子。自由地用的“之”字，作“的”字讲的在现代文章里还常常看见，作“他”字讲的就很少了。这两种“之”字都不是必要的。底下是用得不妥的例子：
    （三）对工人提出的有关安全问题的意见，听之任之，置之不顾。（书）
    （四）为了团结与发挥广大人民群众的积极性、创造性，并使之一致行动起来……（书）
    （五）你处所要材料，查已经与之送去。（件）（三）“置之不顾”不如“置之不理”的现成，“听之任之”是新造的。其实这里只要说“一点不理会”就得了。（四）“之”改做“他们”。（五）“与之送去”不但文言白话不调和，并且“之”不能指“你处”。“已经送去”何等干脆！
    其。  “其”字也有两个意义：一，“那”；二，“他的”“××的”。前者现在只见于“其他”“其余”“其次”等少数词语，后者如：
    （六）其中，其实；只知其一，不知其二；极其，尤其，何其；名副其实；莫名其妙；夸夸其谈；不成其为诗。
    自由用的“其”字也还常见，如“其原因”“其目的”“有其意义”“求其及早实现”“解除其武装”“帝国主义及其走狗”。这些都相当地现成，可也不是非用“其”不可。至于底下这几句，把“其”字当“他”字用，就完全用错了。
    （七）当时由杜逢旭同志上前给其解释。（信）
    （八）但当其自己失败危急的时候，却又会装模作样骗取喘息的机会。（期）
    （九）有的技术人员甚至主张“要崩落欢迎它崩落，崩落了，我们将其装走，省得放炮”。（书）
    所。  “所”字本身没有多少意义。在文言里，“所”加在及物动词之前，指示被动的东西，“所见”等于“看见的”或“看见的东西”。“所”字前面如果有名词或代词，那一定是“所”字后面的动词的主语，如“我所见”。在现代，最常见的是在被动式“为……所”和“被……所”里边。另外还见于一些熟语里，如：
    （十）所得，所得税，所有，所有权，所在，所谓；有所……，无所……，何所……。
    在现在人的文章里，“所”字用错的太多了，只能多少举几个例：
    （十一）“强扭的瓜不甜”之所以为读者所感觉亲切……（期）
    （十二）他们的作品不但在解放区很受欢迎，在解放区外也受很多的人士所喜爱。（期）
    （十三）我国大部煤矿过去是由帝国主义和官僚资本主义所经营的。（书）
    （十四）现在世界上主要的产茶国家如印度、锡兰、印尼（爪哇）、日本等国所种茶树，莫不由中国所移植。（报）
    （十五）仅仅从一九四○——一九四一我在香港与许先生所接触的那一段，就已经使我觉得这短短十六篇东西实在不足以说明这位作者的进度。（报）
    （十六）领导机关曾大力纠正在干部中所存在着的“和平土改”思想。（期）
    （十七）是毛泽东时代的青年所最要不得的态度。（期）
    （十八）这问题是值得我们七位女同学所重视的。（作）
    （十九）只想到本单位的需要，没想到因此而使国家所遭受的损失。（书）（十一）“为……所感觉”是不错的，可是在后面加上一个补充性的附加语“亲切”，就不是这个格式所能容许的了。去掉“所”字，把“为”改做“被”，好些，但是不如说“……之所以能使读者觉得亲切”。（十二）的“受”和（十三）的“由”都跟“为”和“被”不同，不能用“所”。（十二）可以把第二个“受”改做“为”，（十三）应该去掉“所”。（十四）的“由”的宾语表示来源，不表示主动者，后面更不能用“所”。（十五）的“那一段”不是“接触”的宾语，更不是“我与许先生接触”的宾语，前面不能加“所”。（十六）的“存在”是不及物动词，（十七）的“要不得”的作用等于一个形容词，前面不能加“所”。（十八）的“女同学所重视”，（十九）的“国家所遭受的损失”都是对的，可是用在“值得”和“使”后头就不行，非把“所”字去掉不可了。
    所以。  文言里没有“因为……所以……”的说法，只用“……之所以……”提出一个有待于说明的事实，下面说明这件事的原因。这个句法现代文章里也时常看见，如：
    （二十）资产阶级所以不欢迎这一条真理，是因为他们不愿意被人们推翻。（毛）但是也常常用的不妥，如：
    （二一）不论古典和现代作品，其所以成为一本书，不必说成为名著了，文章断无不通之理。（期）该说“既然能成为一本书”。
    而。  “而”字是文言里最常用的一个连接词，相反的两个意思可以用它来连接，相近的两个意思也可以用它来连接，平等的两个成分可以用它来连接，一个附加的成分和一个被附加的成分也可以用它来连接。现代语里确实缺少一个跟它相当的连接词，所以有时候非常需要它。但是它也不是万能的，有些地方是用不上的。我们衡量现代文章里的“而”字，一方面要问，假如这句是文言，这里能不能用“而”字，另一方面要看，按现代的习惯，这里需要不需要连接词。例如：
    （二二）我们已经驱逐了美帝国主义势力出大陆，而它仍不甘心。（期）
    （二三）尚有课长曾在解放前“威风凛凛，高高在上”，贪污，压迫工人，而至今仍为工人所不满。（书）
    （二四）比如上级提出配备干部时，而就按数凑上，却不管质量怎样。（期）
    （二五）即使旧思想偶而冒出来，欺压了工人，而工人们也绝不会认为他的欺压行为就是厂方的意思。（期）
    （二六）现在正是英国雾季的时节，而今天摆在英国人民面前的任务是像雾一样的沉重。（期）这些句子在文言里都不能用“而”字。读了（二二）句，一般人的反应是：“你把它驱逐出去，它当然不甘心啰，怎么能说‘而’它仍不甘心呢？”因为这两个分句之间是一种因果关系，“而”字是不能表示这种关系的。正相反，如果“它居然甘心”，那倒可以用“而”来连接。（二三）的情形相同。（二四）是时间关系，（二五）是假设，（二六）是比喻，这些都不在“而”字的任务范围之内。（二五例可比较第十段七、八两例。）这五句的“而”字都要去掉。（二二）改做“我们把……驱逐出大陆，它自然不甘心”。（二六）在“任务”之后加个“也”字。
    （二七）《两家春》是根据谷峪的短篇小说《强扭的瓜不甜》而改编的。（期）
    （二八）并且用“在学术上的成就未合教学标准”的理由而解聘了斯拉夫学院的苏联史权威罗世坦教授。（期）
    （二九）偏偏中国猿人的化石就在预备运国外的期间而遗失了。（期）这三句的附加成分和主要动词之间，按现代语法都不需要连接词，虽然类似的情形在文言里有时候用“而”字，如“因祸而得福”“一日而行千里”。（二八例如果把“的理由”改做“为理由”就可以保留“而”字。）
    下面这一句是滥用“而”字的例：
    （三十）国民党反动政府滥发纸币，而通货膨胀，物价波动，而引起商人投机倒把，以致生活艰难而民不聊生，而反动派只知搜括，毫不关心。（作）这里用了四个“而”字。拆开来看，没有一个“而”字是绝对不能用的，但是哪有一句里连用四个“而”字的道理呢？前面三个都可以去掉。
    “为……而……”的格式很常见，应该在这里说一说。下面的三个例子代表三种情形：
    （三一）为保家卫国而抗美援朝；为赢得和平幸福的生活而斗争。
    （三二）为和平幸福的生活而斗争；为大众的利益而牺牲一己的利益。
    （三三）为祖国和人民而服务（期）；农民一年到头为地主而劳动。（作）（三一）“为”字底下有动词，非用“而”不可。（三二）可以不用“而”，一般是用“而”的多。这两个例子的“为”都是“为了”的意思。（三三）的“为”是“给”的意思，下面不能用“而”。
    以。  在文言里，“以”字的用处比“而”字更多。在现代文章里可以遇到的大概可以分三类：一，等于“之”的某种用法；二，作“拿”讲；三，有某种过渡作用。分别举例：
    （三四）以上，以下，以内，以外，以前，以后，以往，以来。
    （三五）以少胜多，以毒攻毒，以身作则；以……计，以……而论。
    （三六）以及，以至；以致；以求，以期，以便，以备，以资，以免，以防；用以，借以。
    第一类无须讨论。第二类举的例子都是“以”字在前、主要动词在后的例子。现代语里不能把“拿”字说在后面，文言是可以把“以”字用在后面的，如“给敌人以歼灭性的打击”。也就是这个格式容易用错，例如：
    （三七）际兹新年来临，特向全社同志致以祝贺和慰问。（期）
    （三八）当然姚宪禄对其本身的错误应该负以极大责任。（期）
    （三九）我们必须启发工人群众以国家工矿主人翁的身份。（书）（三七）是模仿“对于这些阶级，必须坚决地毫不犹豫地给以保护”（毛）的格式的，不知道“致”跟“给”的用法不同。“给”字以指人的词为宾语；刚才这句用“给以”的例子可以恢复成“给这些阶级以保护”，但（三七）不能恢复成“致全社同志以祝贺”，只能说“致祝贺于全社同志”。所以原来“致以”的“以”应该取消，让“祝贺和慰问”做“致”的宾语。（三八）是同类而更明显的错误，也只要取消“以”字就成。（三九）硬用“以”字来表示它所不能表示的意思，应该说“必须告诉工人群众，他们现在是国家的主人翁”。（也不能说“国家工矿的主人翁”，他们并不是工厂和矿山的主人翁。）
    作“拿”讲的“以”字必须有另一动词和它配合，下面这两句不合于这个规则，我们就觉得“以”字没有着落。
    （四十）以我的写作经验，我知道把一个舞台剧搬上银幕是相当困难的工作。（期）
    （四一）以过去这段时间和目前工业逐渐进展的情形与未来必能实现的一个生气蓬勃经济建设的美丽远景，不禁使人深刻的体会到新民主主义的优越性。（期）（四十）应该是“以我的写作经验而论”，或“根据我的写作经验”。（四一）应该在“远景”之后加“比较”。（“不禁使人”应为“使人不禁”。）
    第三类的词语大半是表示目的的，这里为篇幅所限，不去讨论。只说明一点，就是单用一个“以”字也可以表示目的，例如：
    （四二）使各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展。（共同纲领）
    以……为。  这是从文言里继承下来的一个极有用的格式。它有好几个意义：
    （四三）我们在国际上是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线一方面的。（毛）
    （四四）美帝国主义还以已经解放的中国人民为可欺。（作）
    （四五）美帝国主义对亚洲各国人民的侵略由来已久，而以占领日本并逐步变日本为其远东侵略基地以来为最露骨。（报）（四三）的“以”作“拿”讲，（四四）作“认为”讲，（四五）作“数”或“要算”讲（比较“红茶以祁门为最有名”）。这个格式应用极其频繁，因而也常常出毛病。例如：
    （四六）黔东一路以镇远为止，黔南一路以贞丰为止，黔西一路以威宁为止。（期）
    （四七）文化馆现有各类图书两万余册。其中以文艺、政治类居多。（期）
    （四八）种烟用肥料以芝麻饼较好。（报）
    （四九）尤以转移和破坏财产的现象，在苏南普遍存在着。（期）
    （五十）布匹方面以印花布及蓝布，在华北、西北、长江一带，由于农村需求甚殷，所以当地市场吸胃均强。（期）
    （五一）近年来，某些以描写对象的真实姓名所写的作品如“王秀鸾”所以受到群众的普遍欢迎……（教）（四六）该说“到……为止”。（四七）该说“以……为多”，或去“以”留“居”。其余四句都是应该用“为”字来跟“以”字配合而忘了的。（四八）是“以……为较好”。（四九）如果保留“以”字，必须说“尤以转移和破坏财产为苏南普遍存在的现象”，但不如改做“尤其是”。（五十）“以……为最畅销”。（五一）“以描写对象的真实姓名为篇名（而写）的作品”。“所写”的“所”字不通，改做“而写”好些，但根本不需要这两个字。
