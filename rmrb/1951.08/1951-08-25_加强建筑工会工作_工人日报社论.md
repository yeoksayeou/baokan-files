　　Strengthen the Work of Construction Unions
    ——Worker’s Daily Editorial
    The construction industry is one of the most important undertakings in the nation's construction period, a matter concerning the country’s long-term plans. Because, whether it is national defense construction, industrial construction, cultural construction, or other construction endeavors, none can be separated from the construction industry. We want to open factories, run schools, build railways, develop ports..., none of which can do without the construction industry. Building a new democratic China now, and building a socialist China in the future, there will never be a day when the construction industry is not needed. If the construction industry is not done well, our nation's basic construction work will be severely affected.

    What is the current situation of the construction industry? In summary, it can be described as chaotic, with extremely serious phenomena of disorganization and lack of leadership. First of all, construction workers have not been well organized. Among the 472,000 construction workers, only 183,000 are union members, accounting for only about 38 percent of the total. Secondly, the public and private construction organizations are also quite chaotic. "Construction companies" are as numerous as hairs. Not long ago, Shanghai even had so-called "briefcase companies," whose responsible person had only a briefcase, rented a room in a hotel, and that was considered a "construction company." As for engineering without plans, materials without unified specifications, construction without systems, etc., there are countless examples. Under these circumstances, it is of course expected, and also a natural result, that there would be shoddy workmanship, perfunctory behavior, subcontracting at every level, and bosses acting tyrannically. And in the end, it is our nation's basic construction cause that suffers the losses.

    This state of anarchy in the construction industry is a relic of the past semi-colonial and semi-feudal economic system. After the victory of the revolution, there have been some transformations in various aspects; in the construction industry, although various localities have also done some work, such as the Northeast, Tianjin, Taiyuan and other places have already or are correcting the chaotic phenomena, but on a national scale, there has not been a fundamental change.

    The National Construction Union Work Conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, based on the situations and experiences of various localities, has proposed methods for sorting out and reforming the construction industry, and handed them over to the relevant parties for adoption and implementation. This is a matter of great significance. Moreover, there is no doubt that assisting the relevant parties to implement these methods is our trade union's major responsibility. However, there are many methods for sorting out and reforming the construction industry, among which the most direct and urgent one related to our trade union work and construction workers is to strengthen the work of the construction union. Only by organizing the nation's construction workers into the construction union, and raising their class consciousness, can the union assist the government in carrying out the work of sorting out and reforming the existing construction industry in a planned and step-by-step manner; and only then can it oppose feudal exploitation and oppression, and protect the interests of construction workers in an organized and led manner.

    We hope that trade union organizations in various localities, under the leadership of the local Party committees, will pay attention to the work of the construction industry, strengthen the work of the construction industry trade unions, organize the broad masses of construction workers, and strive to sort out and reform the existing construction industry!

### 加强建筑工会工作——工人日报社论

　　加强建筑工会工作
    ——工人日报社论
    建筑工业是国家建设时期最重要的事业之一，是有关国家百年大计的事业。因为，不论国防建设、工业建设、文化建设以及其他各种建设事业，都离不开建筑工业。我们要开工厂、办学校、修铁道、辟码头……，没有那一件不需要建筑工业。现在建设新民主主义的中国，将来建设社会主义的中国，没有那一天不需要建筑工业。如果建筑工业搞不好，我们国家的基本建设工作就会受到严重的影响。
    目前建筑业的情况怎样呢？总括起来可以说是混乱不堪，无组织、无领导的现象异常严重。首先是建筑工人还没有组织好，四十七万二千余建筑工人中，工会会员只有十八万三千余人，即不过占全部人数的百分之三十八左右。其次，公私建筑机构也相当混乱。“建筑公司”多如牛毛。不久以前，上海还有所谓“皮包公司”，它的负责人只有一个皮包，在旅馆租一间房子，就算是“建筑公司”。至于工程无计划，材料没有统一规格，施工无制度等等，更是例不胜举。在这种情况下，工程中偷工减料，敷衍塞责，层层转包，把头横行等，当然是意料中事，也是必然的结果。而最后蒙受损失的，则是我们国家的基本建设事业。
    建筑事业中这种无政府状态，是过去半殖民地半封建经济制度的遗物。革命胜利后，各方面都有了一些改造；在建筑业中，虽然各地方也作了些工作，像东北、天津、太原等地已经或正在纠正混乱现象，但在全国范围来说，还没有基本改变。
    全国总工会召集的这次全国建筑工会工作会议，根据各地的情况与经验，提出了整理与改革建筑业的办法，交与各有关方面采纳执行，这是一件具有重大意义的事情。而且，毫无疑义，协助各有关方面贯彻执行这些办法，是我们工会的重大责任。但整理与改革建筑业的办法很多，其中与我们工会工作和建筑工人直接有关的也是最迫切的一条，就是要加强建筑工会工作。只有把全国建筑工人组织到建筑工会中来，提高他们的阶级觉悟，工会才能协助政府，有计划、有步骤地做好整理与改革建筑业的工作；也才能够有组织、有领导地反对封建剥削压迫，保护建筑工人的利益。
    我们希望各地工会组织，在各地党委的领导下，重视建筑工业工作，加强建筑业工会的工作，把广大建筑工人组织起来，依靠建筑工人群众，为整理与改革现有的建筑工业而奋斗！
