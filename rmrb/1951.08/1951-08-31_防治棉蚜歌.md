　　Song of Cotton Aphid Prevention
       Guo Moruo
         I
    Listen, comrades, while I speak:
    This year's cotton aphids have been a great plague.
    The cotton fields of North China have suffered the most,
    And half of the cotton farmers' hard work has been in vain.
    Cotton is our source of clothing,
    And even more so what industrial production relies upon.
    If cotton production cannot be increased,
    Textile raw materials will surely be in shortage.
    This year we can say we've learned a lesson,
    Next year's prevention must be early.
           II
    What methods can be used for prevention?
    There is a simple and effective method.
    There is a kind of wild vegetable called bitter lettuce,
    In the Xinxiang area of the plains it's called duckling seedlings,
    In southern Hebei it's called swallow's tail,
    And in Xuzhou it's also called rabbit grass.
    This kind of wild vegetable is everywhere,
    And sometimes it can be bought in small vegetable markets.
    Its leaves are a bit like violet flowers,
    Its roots are the nest of cotton aphids.
  III
    When winter arrives, the cotton aphids,
    Run from the ground into the earth.
    They run to the roots of the bitter lettuce to lay their eggs,
    And the larvae hatch out of their earthen prison next March.
    At first, they live on the bitter lettuce,
    And then in April and May, they move to the cotton seedlings in the cotton fields.
    This move is truly terrible,
    The trouble is no smaller than locusts.
    Its reproduction power is astonishing,
    People will be shocked to hear it, I guarantee.
    In a single growing season of cotton,
    One cotton aphid will produce six hundred million trillion (60,000 billion billion) offspring.
    This is a single-sex reproduction of a nation of daughters,
    With no less than thirty-some generations in a year.

           IV

    Now that we know this situation,
    We have a trick for prevention.
    If we want cotton aphids to not be a disaster in the future,
    We must pull out the bitter lettuce, roots and all.
    Taking advantage of this year's autumn, let's mobilize,
    Everyone pull out duckling seedlings in the cotton field area.
    Even next spring it won't be too late,
    March and April are the best time.
    When weeding, be sure to remove the roots,
    And the aphids' lives will be hard to save.
    This method is really simple,
    And there will be rewards for eradicating the aphids.
    Since bitter lettuce can be eaten,
    One move accomplishes two things: abundant food and clothing, and happy freedom.

  V

    This research was already published last May,
    Please see the first issue of *Science Bulletin*. [Note]
    I hope that it will be transmitted from province to county to township,
    So that every cotton farmer in the country will know.
    This is the combination of theory and practice,
    Which is also science and production becoming linked.
    There has been no effort to promote it this past year,
    I should examine my own negligence.
    We learn wisdom from mistakes,
    And learn until we are old.
    We have to plant cotton every year,
    And it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost.
    I only hope that the cotton aphids will not flourish from now on,
    And that cotton production will be better year after year.
            (August 29th)
    [Note] This is the research of Mr. Zhu Hongfu of the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. There is a "Report on Cotton Aphid Work" in the first issue of *Science Bulletin* for reference.

　　防治棉蚜歌
       郭沫若
         一
    各位同志听我把话表：
    今年的棉蚜为害真不小。
    华北的棉田糟踏得最厉害，
    棉农的辛苦一半化为了徒劳。
    棉花是我们的衣之源，
    更是工业生产所依靠。
    棉花的产量不能提高，
    纺织的原料自会缺少。
    今年我们算是领了教，
    明年的预防就要趁早。
           二
    有什么方法可以预防？
    有一个方法简单而且好。
    有一种野菜叫着苦买菜，
    平原新乡称为鸭鸭苗，
    冀南人叫作燕儿尾，
    徐州人又叫作兔儿草。
    这种野菜到处有，
    小菜市上有时能买到。
    它的叶子有点像地丁花，
    它的根子就是棉蚜的巢。
  三
    棉蚜活到了冬天来，
    它从地面往地下跑。
    跑到苦买菜的根上去下卵，
    等到明年三月幼虫孵化出土牢。
    起初就在苦买菜上住，
    到了四五月才移到棉田上棉苗。
    这一移住真糟糕，
    乱子不比蝗虫小。
    它的蕃殖力量可惊人，
    人们听了保管会骇倒。
    棉花生长的一个节季里，
    一头棉蚜要产子孙六亿兆（六万亿亿）。
    这是单性生殖的女儿国，
    一年间三十几代有多不会少。
　
           四
　
    这个情形让我们知道了，
    预防的办法就有了窍。
    要想棉蚜今后不为灾，
    就得把苦买菜连根来拔掉。
    趁着今年的秋天大动员，
    棉田地带大家齐拔鸭鸭苗。
    就到明春也还不算迟，
    三四月间为最好。
    除草一定要除根，
    蚜子的性命就难保。
    这个办法真是很简单，
    根治了蚜虫还有酬劳。
    苦买菜既然可以吃，
    一举两得丰衣足食乐逍遥。
　
  五
　
    这个研究去年五月已发表，
    请看《科学通报》第一号。〔注〕
    我希望由省传县县传乡，
    要使全国棉农个个都知道。
    这就是理论与实际相结合，
    也就是科学和生产订了交。
    一年来没有用力去推行，
    我自己的疏忽该检讨。
    吃一堑来长一智，
    活到老来学到老。
    年年都要种棉花，
    不算亡羊才补牢。
    但愿得棉蚜从此不蕃昌，
    棉花的产量一年更比一年好。
            （八月二十九日）
    〔注〕这是科学院昆虫研究室朱弘复先生的研究，在《科学通报》第一号上有“关于棉蚜工作的报导”可供参考。
