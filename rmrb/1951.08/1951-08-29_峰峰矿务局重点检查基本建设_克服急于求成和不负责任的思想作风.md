Following the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee's notification regarding strict inspection of basic construction project designs, the Hebei Fengfeng Mining Bureau conducted a focused inspection of capital construction projects from 1950 and 1951. The main projects inspected were the left fourth and left fifth stone gate (tunneling) projects on the east winch road in the No. 1 mine, the temporary tipping cage project on the ground of the No. 1 mine [Note 1], and the "700-meter" wheel slope project [Note 2] in the No. 2 mine. Due to the impetuousness of leading cadres, the lack of overall consideration, the irresponsibility of technical personnel, and the blindness of design work, all three projects had many problems.

　　Insufficient Investigation and Research, Pretending to Understand Drawings
　　Wasted More Than 100 Meters of Tunneling
　　The left fourth stone gate project on the east winch road of the No. 1 mine started in March 1950 and stopped in April. Due to insufficient investigation and research by leading cadres and technical personnel, and the lack of overall consideration, all 65.9 meters of completed tunneling work were wasted (later used as a ventilation duct). The purpose of this project was to connect the "Tongshun Well" and the "Shengli Well." This roadway was intended to be the transport route for mining the northwest coal seam of the mine. When formulating this project plan, administrative leaders were eager to mine coal across the "fault" [Note 3], without conducting investigation and research or careful consideration. They made only principle instructions and blindly allowed construction to proceed. When tunneling reached 65.9 meters, it was discovered that it would be more convenient to pass the fault through the left fifth roadway to connect the "Shengli Well" for drainage and transportation. At this point, the left fourth stone gate project was stopped.

　　The left fifth stone gate project started in late May 1950. The original plan for this project was 154 meters, but 234.35 meters were tunneled, wasting more than 80 meters. The reason for the error was that the engineer who drew the design sketch used a term that ordinary people did not understand, "angle of deviation" (a Japanese term). After the sketch was completed, he did not explain it in detail to the constructors and did not inspect the construction drawings and construction situation. The engineer responsible for making the construction drawings pretended to understand and instructed the surveyors to mistakenly change the "angle of deviation" to "angle of reflection" when setting the line. As a result, the angle of the roadway was greatly reduced and almost parallel to the fault. It was not until tunneling reached about 150 meters that the original designer discovered it and corrected it. From the beginning to passing the fault and encountering coal, a total of 234.35 meters were tunneled.

　　Design Work Not Serious Enough, Impractical
　　Constant Changes, Rework, and Delays
　　The temporary tipping cage project in the No. 1 mine was affected by the lack of a serious attitude towards design work by leading cadres and technical personnel, especially the perfunctory attitude of technical personnel who did not work diligently and actively, resulting in many problems in the design and affecting the project progress. In the initial design, the location was chosen incorrectly twice, delaying the start date. During the design, those responsible for civil engineering and those responsible for electromechanical engineering did not communicate with each other, holding the wrong idea of "everyone sweeps the snow from their own door, and doesn't care about the frost on other people's roofs." For example, the calculation of the distance between the two wooden beams of the coal hopper under the tipping cage was inconsistent between civil engineering and electromechanical. The civil engineering side calculated the distance from the outer edge of the wooden beam to the outer edge, while the electromechanical side calculated from the centerline of the wooden beam to the centerline. As a result, the coal hopper installation was affected, and it had to be changed. For example, at the installation location of the tipping cage foot brake [Note 4], the designer only left one meter wide. After the foot brake was installed, it had to extend outside the railing, and the operator could not stand to operate it. Some designers also had serious dogmatic tendencies. The design of the curvature of the curve was determined according to the curve in the American technical manual, rather than based on the length of the distance between the front and rear axles of the coal car. As a result, it could not be used due to the small curvature and had to be reworked. The hasty work style of the designers in not conducting thorough investigation and research and precise calculations also caused many errors. When designing the retaining wall, the designer did not calculate the coal pressure and tipping force, and rashly decided that the wall thickness should be 0.65 meters. After use, an outward tilting phenomenon occurred. The original plan for the track foundation for the upper and lower coal cars was to use a wooden frame, but in order to save money, it was changed to use coal piles instead of wooden frames. In reality, this accumulated a very large amount of coal, so it was changed again to use old wood as the track foundation, greatly prolonging the construction time. In addition, the lack of communication between the designer and the constructor, and the constructor not doing work according to the drawings, also caused some errors. For example, when building the ring, the work was not done according to the drawings, resulting in a rework due to the elevation being 500 millimeters too low. This project was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of April; due to the lack of thorough design and multiple reworks, it was not roughly completed until the end of June, wasting a total of 61 days. If it could have been completed and operated according to the original plan, 1,830 pithead transportation workers and 1.22 million catties of millet loading fees could have been saved in these 61 days.

　　Failure to Grasp the Actual Situation Underground
　　Wheel Slope Project Exceeded Budget by 100%
　　The "700-meter" wheel slope project in the No. 2 mine started in June 1950, but it is still unusable. The reason for the problem is that the design's investigation and research were insufficient, and the actual situation underground was not grasped. At the same time, the leadership and the designer lacked overall consideration, and the design was very incomplete. The purpose of building this wheel slope was to concentrate the coal from the "Shuanghe Well" and transport it out through the "Taian Pit." The wheel slope is 440 meters long. In June of last year, construction started from the "Shuanghe Well" from top to bottom, and in August, construction started from the 700-meter mark of the east inclined shaft of the "Taian Pit" from bottom to top. At the beginning of construction, the design only drew a line on the underground plan and a description of the double-track specifications of the endless rope (the steel cable for the coal car), and there were no other technical instructions for construction. The elevation of the two ends of the wheel slope, the slope of the ramp, whether there were stone gates, the transportation method, and how the bypasses of the yards at both ends were arranged were not considered. After 67 meters of the ramp were made, the slope and the problem of passing through the stone gate were considered. At that time, it was planned to adopt a uniform slope, but because the stone gate was too long (330 meters), it was handed over to Engineer Gao Gu for research. Engineer Gao did not conduct on-site exploration, nor did he solicit the opinions of old workers, but based on the geological changes of the two nearby base roads, he decided that the wheel slope should be excavated along the coal seam incline and made a design drawing for the stone gate to pass through. In this way, only 46 meters passed through the stone gate. However, during the excavation, 54 meters of "old empty" area (collapsed old working area, extremely difficult to excavate) were encountered. This caused great difficulties for the project, exceeded the budget by 100%, and delayed the project for a long time. It was not until April of this year that the project was completely completed. This "old empty" collapse was only a little over ten years ago. If the designer had consulted the old workers, they could have known about this situation, and this difficulty could have been avoided. After the wheel slope was completed according to the original plan, the administrative leaders decided to extend the ramp upward by 140 meters in order to facilitate transportation in the "Shuanghe Well." At this time, consideration was given to building upper and lower yards and bypasses. Now, part of the upper yard has been completed, but the lower yard cannot be started because a stone gate needs to be built, but there is no project budget. So far, the project has been going on for more than a year, but the endless rope has not been used. The financial system was also poorly implemented during the project. The preliminary and final accounts could not be made in time, making the entire project carried out blindly. The final account for the 1950 project was not made until April 1951. At the same time, in order to catch up with the 1950 final account, the accounts before April of this year were completely suspended. This is also an expression of the lack of seriousness and earnestness in basic construction work.

　　In the Future, We Must Overcome the Problem of Hasty Work
　　Have a Thorough Plan and Long-Term Perspective
　　Through this focused inspection, the mine has learned some lessons. On the leadership front, in the future, we will strive to overcome the problem of being impetuous and hasty. When carrying out basic construction, leading cadres must consider the overall situation and make long-term plans, and can no longer take one step and say one step. No construction will be carried out without a thorough and accurate plan design. At the same time, there must be a dedicated person responsible for the unified leadership of future basic construction, and seriously review and inspect the progress of design and construction, so as to avoid each acting independently and not communicating with each other. Among the technical personnel, the irresponsible attitude of perfunctoriness and pushing and shoving must be fundamentally changed. When carrying out the design, a thorough investigation and research must be conducted to ensure that the design conforms to the objective situation; at the same time, the shortcomings of dogmatism must also be overcome. To this end, the bureau pointed out that technical personnel must conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. In terms of organization, the bureau proposed that in the case of a lack of technical personnel and insufficient experience, technical personnel should be used centrally. In order to turn failure into victory, the bureau will continue to conduct in-depth inspections in mid-September, and focus on solving the ideological style problems of leading cadres and technical personnel.

　　[Note 1] Tipping cage—cage is a common name for coal car. Tipping cage is to dump the coal out of the coal car.
　　[Note 2] Wheel slope—The coal seam underground is not necessarily flat, but mostly inclined. The coal at the upper part is transported by coal cars through the inclined roadway to the main transportation roadway at the lower part. The coal car moves down with or without power, and a circular wheel is installed at the upper end. The steel cable that secures the coal car passes through this wheel to move the coal car up and down. This inclined roadway for transporting coal is called the wheel slope.
　　[Note 3] Fault—Coal is layered underground. After the coal is formed, the stratum (stone layer and coal layer) is often faulted due to crustal movement. The faulted area is called a fault. Passing through the fault is to excavate a stone cave (stone gate) along the coal seam after excavating to the fault to bypass the faulted coal seam so that mining can continue.
　　[Note 4] Tipping cage foot brake—A brake stepped on with the foot, which can control the turning speed of the tipping cage and stop it.

　　峰峰矿务局重点检查基本建设
    克服急于求成和不负责任的思想作风
    政务院财政经济委员会关于严格检查基本建设工程设计的通知发出后，河北峰峰矿务局对一九五○年和一九五一年的基本建设进行了重点检查。这次检查的主要工程是一矿井下东绞车道左四路和左五路石门工程（巷道掘进工程），一矿地面临时翻罐笼〔注一〕工程和二矿“七百米”轮子坡〔注二〕工程。由于领导干部的急于求成，缺乏通盘考虑，技术人员不负责任以及设计工作的盲目性等，三个工程都出了很多毛病。
  调查研究不够绘图不懂装懂
  浪费了一百多公尺掘进工程
    一矿井下东绞车道左四石门工程系于一九五○年三月开工，四月停工。由于领导干部和技术人员的调查研究不够，未做通盘考虑，已完成的六十五点九公尺的掘进工程全部浪费（后被利用为风道）。作这个工程的目的，是为了沟通“通顺井”和“胜利井”。这个巷道就作为开采该矿西北地区煤层的运搬道。制定这个工程计划时，行政领导干部急于过“断层”〔注三〕采煤，未进行调查研究和周密考虑，只做出原则指示就盲目地让施工。掘进到六十五点九公尺时，发现如果由左五巷道过断层通“胜利井”，排水运搬均较左四巷道方便。至此，左四石门工程停工。
    左五石门工程于一九五○年五月下旬开工。这个工程原计划为一百五十四公尺，结果掘进了二百三十四点三五公尺，浪费了八十多公尺。发生差错的原因是：设计草图的工程师在图样上用了一个一般人不懂得的名词“偏倚角”（日本术语）。草图完成后，他又未向施工者详细交代，对施工图样和施工情况未予检查。负责做施工图的工程师则不懂装懂，指挥测量人员把“偏倚角”错误地改按“反射角”挂线。这样，巷道的角度就大为减小，和断层几乎平行。直到掘进到一百五十公尺左右时，原设计人才发现，并予改正。从开始到过断层遇煤共掘进二百三十四点三五公尺。
  设计工作不够严肃不切实际
  工程不断变更返工延误进度
    一矿临时翻罐笼工程由于领导干部和技术人员对设计工作的态度不严肃，特别是技术人员采取应付的态度，不认真积极工作，以致设计中问题很多，影响工程进度。初设计时，曾两次选择地点不当，延误开工日期。设计中负责土木的与负责机电的互不连系，抱着“各人自扫门前雪，休管他人瓦上霜”的错误思想。比如对翻罐笼下的承煤漏斗的两木梁距离的计算，土木和机电就不一致。土木方面是从木梁的外边线到外边线计算距离，机电则从木梁的中心线到中心线计算。结果影响煤斗安装，只好更改。又如翻罐笼脚闸〔注四〕安装处，设计者只留有一公尺宽。脚闸安上后要伸到栏杆外面，操作人无法站立操作。有些设计者还有严重的教条主义偏向。弯道弯度的设计是根据美国技术手册中的曲线决定的，而不是根据煤罐前后两轴距离的长短决定的。结果因弯度小不能用而返工。设计人员调查研究精确计算不够的草率从事的作风也造成不少错误。设计护墙时，设计者未计算煤压及冲倒力，便冒然决定墙厚为零点六五公尺。经用后发生向外倾倒现象。上下煤罐的道基原计划用木架，为了省钱改以煤堆代替木架。实际上这样积压煤炭数目极大，于是又改为以旧木做道基，大大地拖长了工程时间。另外，设计者和施工者双方联系不够，施工者不按图样做活，也造成一些错误。比如圈砌时不照图做活，结果因?低五百公厘而造成返工。这个工程原定四月底就要完成的；由于设计不周密多次返工，直到六月底才大致完工，共浪费六十一日。假如能按原计划完工运转，这六十一日中就可节省一千八百三十个坑口运搬工和一百二十二万斤小米的装车费。
  没有掌握井下的确实情况
  轮子坡工程超出预算一倍
    二矿“七百米”轮子坡工程一九五○年六月就开了工，但直到现在尚不能使用。发生问题的原因，在于设计的调查研究不够，未掌握井下的确实情况，同时领导上和设计者缺乏通盘考虑，设计十分不完整。修建这个轮子坡的目的是为了把“双和井”下面的煤集中在“太安坑”运出。轮子坡全长四百四十公尺。去年六月由“双和井”自上向下动工，八月又由“太安坑”东斜井七百公尺处由下而上动工。动工时，设计只是在井下平面图上划了一道线条和无极绳（系煤车的钢丝绳）的双轨规格的说明，其他就没有任何施工中的技术指示。轮子坡两端标高、坡道坡度、有无石门、搬运方法及两端车场绕道如何布置等，均未考虑。坡道做了六十七公尺，才考虑到坡度和过石门问题。当时想采取统一坡度，但因石门过长（三百三十公尺），才交给高谷工程师研究。而高工程师没有做实地的探测，也没有征询老工人的意见，只是根据附近两个基道的地质变化情况，决定轮子坡沿煤层倾斜掘进，并作出石门对穿设计图。这样，只过石门四十六公尺。但掘进中却遇到“老空”地带（坍陷了的老工作地区，掘进极困难）五十四公尺。这就使工程遇到极大的困难，使预算超过百分之百，工程拖延很久，直到今年四月才全部完工。这个“老空”坍陷才不过十几年，假若设计者能征求一下老工人的意见，是可以知道这个情况的，这个困难是可以避免的。轮子坡按原计划做好后，行政领导方面为使“双和井”运搬方便，又决定坡道向上延长一百四十公尺。这时，才考虑到做上下车场及绕道。现在上部车场已做好一部分，下部车场因需打石门却又无工程预算而不能动工。到现在为止，工程已进行一年多，但无极绳仍未能使用。这个工程进行中，财物制度贯彻得也很差。预决算不能及时做出，使整个工程在盲目中进行。一九五○年工程的决算到一九五一年四月才做出。同时，为赶一九五○年决算，今年四月份前账目完全停顿。这也是对基本建设工作不够严肃认真的一种表现。
  今后要克服草率从事的毛病
  要有周密的计划长远的打算
    经过这次重点检查，该矿已摸索到一些经验教训。在领导干部方面，今后将努力克服急于求成以致草率从事的毛病。进行基本建设时，领导干部一定要通盘考虑，做长远打算，不能再走一步说一步。没有周密精确的计划设计，决不施工。同时，对今后的基本建设要有专人负责统一领导，认真审核检查设计施工的进行，以免各自为政，互不联系。在技术人员中，首先要根本转变敷衍塞责、推推动动的不负责任态度。进行设计时，必须进行周密的调查研究，才能使自己的设计符合客观情况；同时教条主义的缺点也必须克服。为此，该局指出技术人员必须认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想。在组织方面，该局提出，在技术人员缺乏、经验不足的情况下，技术人员应集中使用。为了变失败为胜利，该局在九月中将继续进行深入的检查，并着重解决领导干部和技术人员的思想作风问题。
    〔注一〕翻罐笼——罐是煤车的俗称。翻罐笼就是把煤车的煤倒出来。
    〔注二〕轮子坡——煤层在地下不一定是平的，大部分是倾斜的。上部的煤由煤车经过斜坡巷道运到下部主要的运搬巷道来。煤车下行用或不用动力，而上端安装圆形轮子，系煤车的钢丝绳经此轮子使煤车上下。这运煤的斜坡巷道称为轮子坡。
    〔注三〕断层——煤在地下皆成层状，煤生成后，经地壳变动，往往将地层（石层及煤层）错断，这错断的地方称为断层。过断层是沿煤层掘进到断层后凿石洞（石门）绕到被断的煤层内，这样才能继续采煤。
    〔注四〕翻罐笼脚闸——用脚踏的闸，可以节制翻罐笼转动速度快慢及使之停止。
