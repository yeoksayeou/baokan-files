Thoroughly Eliminate American Special Agents and Spies
　　Zhu Yunshan

The American special agent and spy conspiracy for armed rebellion case has been adjudicated by the Beijing Military Control Commission Military Law Office. Li An-tung, Yamaguchi Ryuichi, Madi Nuo, Wei Zhi, Zhe Li, Gansner, and Ma Xinqing, this group of extremely heinous criminals, have received the punishment they deserved. This massive, vicious, and ruthless special agent and spy case was conducted under the direct command of the former U.S. Strategic Intelligence Agency, the U.S. Occupation Army Headquarters in Tokyo, and the former U.S. Embassy's Military Attaché Office in Peiping, and was an aggressive claw of American imperialism secretly extended into China. This just verdict not only exposed the despicable and shameless conspiracy of American imperialism before the people of the world, but also proved that the Chinese people who have defeated internal and external reactionaries have the power to destroy all overt and covert reactionary forces and consolidate their victory.

The various shameless tricks of American imperialism have failed more than once. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to arming the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries with billions of U.S. dollars, massacring the Chinese people, and openly becoming enemies of the Chinese people, it also used various conspiracies and tricks in an attempt to undermine our democratic movement; after the national liberation, we have repeatedly uncovered major cases of American imperialist special agents and spies. This proves that American imperialism and its running dogs will never be reconciled to their failure and will continue to carry out destructive activities against the People's China by various despicable and base means. However, the era when American imperialism ran rampant in China has ended with the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique. The victorious Chinese people are determined and able to sever the imperialist claws of aggression against China and safeguard national security. The uncovering of the Li An-tung, Yamaguchi Ryuichi, and others' conspiracy for armed rebellion case is an example.

People of all democratic classes, democratic parties, and all walks of life across the country, let us unite more closely around the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, maintain the highest degree of vigilance against the imperialist, especially American imperialist, conspiracies to invade and sabotage our country, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, safeguard the fruits of the people's revolution, and ensure that any imperialist elements who dare to infringe upon the happy life of our people have no foothold in the land of New China!

　　彻底消灭美国特务间谍
    朱蕴山
    美国特务间谍阴谋武装暴动案，已经被我北京市军事管制委员会军法处判决，李安东、山口隆一、马迪懦、魏智、哲立、甘斯纳、马新清这一批罪大恶极的罪犯，已经受到应受的惩罚。这个规模巨大的、凶恶毒辣的特务间谍案，是先后在美国战略情报局、东京美国占领军总部、前美国大使馆驻北平武官处直接指挥之下进行的，是美帝国主义暗中伸入中国的一只侵略魔爪。这一正义的判决，不仅在全世界人民面前揭穿了美帝国主义卑鄙无耻的阴谋，也证明战胜了内外反动派的中国人民，有力量摧毁一切公开的与潜藏的反动势力，巩固自己的胜利。
    美帝国主义的种种无耻技俩，曾经不止一次的破产。在抗日战争胜利之后，除以数十亿美元武装蒋介石反动派，屠杀中国人民，公开与中国人民为敌外，并曾用种种阴谋诡计，妄图破坏我民主运动；全国解放以后，我们复一再破获美帝国主义特务间谍的重大案件。这证明美帝国主义及其走狗们决不会甘心于他们的失败，一定会用各种各样卑鄙下流的手段，继续进行对人民中国的破坏活动。但是，美帝国主义在中国横行无忌的时代已经随蒋介石反动派的覆灭而覆灭了，胜利了的中国人民，有决心也有能力斩断帝国主义侵略中国的魔爪，保卫国家的安全。李安东、山口隆一等阴谋武装暴动案的被破获，就是一个榜样。
    全国各民主阶级、各民主党派以及各界人民，让我们更紧密地团结在中央人民政府和中国共产党的周围，对于帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义力图侵略与破坏我国的阴谋，保持最高度的警惕，巩固人民民主专政，保卫人民革命胜利果实，使任何敢于侵犯我国人民幸福生活的帝国主义分子，在新中国的土地上，没有立足之地！
