    Delusions that Youth Should Not Laugh
    According to the "Neue Zeitung," published in West Germany by the American occupation authorities, West German police have recently strengthened their forces and are in a state of "combat readiness" to prevent West German youth from crossing the boundaries of the occupation zone to participate in the World Youth and Student Festival for Peace—because it is a grand gathering of youth from all over the world to defend peace and oppose war.
    People with eye diseases are afraid of sunlight, and war-mongers who plot to create weeping and death are afraid of hearing laughter that praises peace and victory. However, barbed wire cannot stop the loud laughter coming from the Ubrikh Square, nor can it stop the resonance in the hearts of West German youth.
   An Exposed Conspiracy
    The Japanese newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun" recently published a piece of news saying that, according to Seyama Sonosuke, who had been recruited to Taiwan as a "volunteer soldier," about 300 Japanese were recruited as "volunteer soldiers" in early August last year, and sailed from Japan to Taiwan on 15 fishing boats in "smuggling" operations. The recruitment was presided over by former Japanese Lieutenant General Nemoto Hiroshi and Nozaki Kimio, and planned by former Japanese army officers. This news once again exposes the conspiracy of American imperialism to use Japanese militarist elements to antagonize our people.

    妄想不许青年欢笑
    据美国占领当局在西德出版的“新报”消息，最近几天以来，西德警察已增强实力，处于“战斗准备状态”中，要防止西德青年越过占领区的边界去参加世界青年与学生和平联欢节——因为它是一个全世界青年保卫和平反对战争的盛会。
    有眼病的人害怕阳光，阴谋制造哭泣与死亡的战争贩子害怕听到人们歌颂和平胜利的欢笑。但是，铁丝网决阻挡不住从乌布利希广场传出的洪亮的笑声，也决阻止不了西德青年们心里所起的共鸣。
   揭穿了的诡计
    日本报纸“读卖新闻”最近登载一段消息说：据曾经被招募到台湾去当过“义勇军”的濑山孙四郎透露，去年八月初旬，曾有约三百名日本人被招募为“义勇军”，分乘渔船十五艘，从日本“偷渡”到台湾。这项招募工作是以前日本中将根本博与野崎公雄主持，而由前日本陆军将校计划的。这一消息再次揭穿了美帝国主义利用日本军国主义分子与我国人民为敌的阴谋诡计。
