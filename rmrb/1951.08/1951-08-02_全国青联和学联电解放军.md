　　To all commanders and fighters of the beloved Chinese People's Liberation Army:
    The "August 1st" Army Day is coming, and the youth and students of the whole country are celebrating this glorious and great festival with joy and excitement.
    The youth and students of the whole country know that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has carried out a long and arduous bloody struggle, and finally overthrew the criminal rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China, established a new China, and created a free and happy life and a bright future for the Chinese people and Chinese youth.
    Today, although American imperialism has accepted the Korean armistice talks, the United States has not abandoned its policy of aggression. It still occupies our country's Taiwan and is carrying out various acts of aggression in the Far East. Therefore, we must strengthen our national defense construction and actively participate in the sacred cause of defending the motherland. Recently, hundreds of thousands of young students have responded to the call of the motherland and signed up to join military cadre schools. Every patriotic youth considers it the greatest glory to be a member of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    Dear comrades, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army! You have made immortal contributions to the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people, you have demonstrated unparalleled heroism in combat, and you are worthy of being the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. We hereby extend our highest respect and heartfelt greetings to you on behalf of the youth and students of the whole country.
            All-China Federation of Democratic Youth
            All-China Students' Federation

　　全国青联和学联电解放军
    亲爱的中国人民解放军全体指战员同志们：
    “八一”建军节到来了，全国青年和学生都怀着欢欣鼓舞的心情，来庆祝这个光荣、伟大的节日。
    全国青年和学生都知道，中国人民解放军在共产党和毛主席领导下，进行了长期的、艰苦的流血斗争，并最后推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的罪恶统治，建立了新中国，为中国人民和中国青年创造了自由幸福的生活和光辉灿烂的前途。
    今天美帝国主义虽然接受了朝鲜的停战谈判，但是，美国仍没有放弃它的侵略政策，还侵占我国的台湾，并在远东进行各种侵略活动。因此，我们还必须加强国防建设，踊跃参加保卫祖国的神圣事业。最近就有数十万余青年学生响应祖国号召，报名参加军事干部学校。每一个爱国青年，都以能成为中国人民解放军的一员而为最大的光荣。
    亲爱的人民解放军全体指战员同志们！你们在中国人民解放事业中立下了不朽的功绩，你们在战斗中表现了无上的英雄气概，你们不愧为中国人民最优秀的儿女，我们谨代表全国青年和学生向你们致以崇高的敬礼，并表示亲切的慰问。
            中华全国民主青年联合总会
            中华全国学生联合会
