　　The Vietnam National United Front and the Revolutionary Cause of the Vietnamese People
　　—Commemorating the Sixth Anniversary of the August Revolution in Vietnam
　　Head of the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China Huang Guo Yue
　　The past eighty years of Vietnamese history is a bloody and sinful history of the French colonialists' slaughter and exploitation of the Vietnamese people, and it is also a history of the Vietnamese people's heroic resistance against imperialist aggression and struggle for national independence. The Vietnamese people have bravely and unyieldingly resisted foreign aggression with various forms of struggle.

　　After the First World War, the leadership of the Vietnamese people's anti-French imperialist movement temporarily fell into the hands of the national bourgeoisie and its political party—the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (founded in 1927). However, because the Vietnamese national bourgeoisie was extremely weak, after the failure of the Yen Bai Uprising led by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party in February 1930, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party collapsed and completely lost its leadership role. The leadership of the revolution to strive for national independence and liberation fell on the shoulders of the increasingly developed proletariat, which represented advanced productive forces, and its political party—the Dongyang Communist Party (i.e., the Indochinese Communist Party). This new and energetic party included workers who had been engaged in a long and arduous struggle against French colonists in factories and plantations, and Vietnamese revolutionaries who had participated in actual revolutionary struggles in France, Siam, and the Guangzhou Commune and had been tempered for a long time.

　　As soon as the Dongyang Communist Party stepped onto the Vietnamese political stage, it appeared with a new attitude. The Dongyang Communist Party and its leader Ho Chi Minh clearly pointed out that one of the main reasons for the failure of past struggles was that the leading class could not establish a broad and solid unified organization including people from all walks of life to exert the strong potential strength of the Vietnamese nation, embark on the correct path, and fight against the common enemy. As soon as the Dongyang Communist Party was established, it placed the establishment of a national united front based on the worker-peasant alliance on the main agenda.

　　In order to complete the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary tasks, the Dongyang Communist Party has always unswervingly organized the united front in various forms according to the needs of the people. Initially, it took the form of jointly organizing an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal alliance with the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (1930-1931), but because the alliance had just been established and no common program to be followed was formulated, and because the Vietnamese Nationalist Party's practice of adventurism led to the failure of the Yen Bai Uprising, it not only made the Nationalist Party unable to recover from then on, but also affected the realization of the alliance organizational form.

　　In 1935, the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists prepared to launch a war, and the anti-fascist wave swept the world. The People's Front achieved victory in France, and this victory directly helped the Dongyang Communist Party to expand. The Dongyang Communist Party immediately mobilized a large number of cadres to go deep into the people, adopted open and semi-open activities, publicized and organized the masses, launched a nationwide "Dongyang People's Congress" movement, demanding democratic rights, and at the same time established a democratic united front in Indochina, putting forward slogans such as "Have clothes to wear, have food to eat, freedom, and peace!" The members of this front included workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and "modernists" (a school organized by progressive intellectuals with narrow nationalism at that time) and the French Socialist Party branch in Vietnam. Under the flexible leadership of the Dongyang Communist Party, the Democratic Front won many democratic rights.

　　Due to the betrayal of the right wing of the French Socialist Party, the French People's Front suffered setbacks and failed. In September 1939, the Second World War broke out, and the French colonialists again used their cruel and barbaric means of suppression to devastate the Vietnamese revolutionary movement, and various revolutionary groups were forced to go underground. In November 1939, the Dongyang Communist Party called on the Vietnamese people to actively organize an anti-fascist national united front. In June 1940, the French Petain government surrendered to Hitler, and three months later, the French colonialists in Indochina succumbed to the Japanese invaders, and the Japanese invaders marched into Indochina. Although the Vietnamese people were under the dual cruel oppression of the Japanese and French imperialists, the Dongyang Communist Party's leadership of the Vietnamese people's struggle was more active and heroic than before. During this period, there were three spectacular armed uprisings that failed due to various conditions not being ripe, namely the uprising in Beishan on September 23, 1940, the great uprising in Nam Ky on November 23 of the same year, and the uprising in the Dulong area on January 13, 1941. In May 1941, following the timely guidance of Comrade Ho Chi Minh, a meeting including representatives of 50 revolutionary groups was held in a certain place in Guangxi Province, China, and the Vietnam National United Front—the Vietnam Independence League (abbreviated as Viet Minh)—was re-established, actively leading the Vietnamese people to carry out national liberation struggles and prepare to greet victory and take back the people's power.

　　The Viet Minh is a national united front jointly formed by all patriotic parties and patriotic groups of all strata in Vietnam, including the Dongyang Communist Party, various workers' and peasants' groups, and youth, women, culture, elders, and religious national salvation associations. By June 1944, the Vietnam Democratic Party also joined this front.

　　In order to defeat the two main enemies—the Japanese and French imperialists, the Viet Minh implemented a historically significant land policy, implementing rent and interest reduction, confiscating the land of French colonialists and Vietnamese traitors, temporarily distributing it to poor and hired peasants, and rationally using public land in order to improve the lives of peasants; on the other hand, it concentrated the strength of the whole people to realize the current main and urgent anti-imperialist task.

　　Since its establishment, the Viet Minh has launched the "Anti-French and Expel Japan" movement, developing guerrilla warfare in various parts of the country in a planned and step-by-step manner, and first established revolutionary base areas in Viet Bac. On December 22, 1944, the Vietnam Liberation Army first appeared on Vietnamese soil, making the Vietnamese people's armed struggle enter a new stage. As the Dongyang Communist Party had foreseen, the contradiction between the French and Japanese imperialists would develop to an extreme point and would lead to military conflict, which would create favorable conditions for the Vietnamese revolution. On March 9, 1945, the Japanese army disarmed all the French troops. Since the "March 9th Incident," the anti-Japanese national salvation upsurge launched by the Viet Minh surged across the country. On August 15, 1945, the Viet Minh headquarters convened the All-Vietnam National Congress in Xinchao, Tuyen Quang Province, elected the National Liberation Committee, and launched a nationwide armed general uprising to seize power according to the plan predetermined by the Dongyang Communist Party. Four days later, the "August Revolution" broke out in the capital Hanoi, and the seizure of power in various regions of the country was also declared successful one after another. On September 2, 1945, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with Comrade Ho Chi Minh as Chairman was born! Under the leadership of the Dongyang Communist Party, the Viet Minh front strived for independence for the motherland and democracy for the people, and clearly pointed out to the people of Vietnam the broad road to building a prosperous and strong democratic country.

　　As soon as the revolution achieved initial victory, new difficulties followed.

　　On September 23, 1945, the troops of the British Empire landed in southern Vietnam and brought a large number of French troops to re-invade Vietnam, and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops occupied all areas north of 16 degrees north latitude. The reactionaries of the "Vietnam Revolutionary Alliance" and the "Vietnam Nationalist Party" entered Vietnam accompanied by Chiang's bandit troops and carried out large-scale harassment. At that time, the situation of the Vietnamese people was difficult and the tasks were heavy. In the face of this internal and external crisis, the national united front should not only include the existing revolutionary groups, but also further strive for all possible patriotic forces in all strata in order to resist the enemy and puppet's incitement of discord and the poisonous policy of conspiracy to split the nation. Therefore, on May 27, 1946, the "Vietnam National United Association" (abbreviated as Viet Lien) was announced. This was established to make the national united front more widely and comprehensively developed and to adapt to the needs of the situation at that time. The Viet Minh joined the Viet Lien as a strong pillar of the Viet Lien front, playing a backbone role. In addition, the Viet Lien also absorbed progressives from the Vietnam Revolutionary Alliance and the Vietnam Nationalist Party and mass organizations established after 1945, such as: the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, the Vietnam Cultural Association, the Vietnam Women's Federation, the Vietnam Democratic Youth Federation, the Vietnam Student Union, and the Vietnam Marxist Research Association. The Viet Lien has thus become a broad mass organization uniting all parties, nationalities, strata, religions, people's organizations, and non-party patriotic people in Vietnam.

　　In order to adapt to the development of the objective situation, on November 7, 1948, the Viet Minh headquarters expressed its desire to unify the organization with the Viet Lien. At that time, all cadres at all levels in the united front were working towards this direction. In March of this year, after the establishment of the Vietnam Labor Party, the unified conference of the Viet Lien and Viet Minh was also convened, and the merger procedures were successfully completed, and the "Vietnam National United Front" (abbreviated as Viet Lien Front) was established, becoming the broadest and strongest front in Vietnamese history. The 21 million Vietnamese people wholeheartedly believe in the wise and correct leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the working class party—the Vietnam Labor Party, believe that with their united strength and firm fighting will, they will surely eliminate the French colonialists and American interventionists and their running dogs—the traitorous Vietnamese traitors, and strive for the complete realization of national independence and people's democracy, and contribute to the cause of defending world peace.

　　Undeniably, the various forms of the united front in the past have played a role in promoting the Vietnamese revolutionary movement. Especially the Viet Minh front, it has written a glorious page in the revolutionary combat history of the Vietnamese people—an unforgettable day—August 19, 1945.

　　Inheriting and carrying forward the revolutionary traditional spirit of the Viet Minh, the Viet Lien Front has now become a strong political force, which will promote the war of resistance to win complete victory. The establishment of the Vietnam Labor Party, the formation of a fraternal alliance between the three ethnic groups of Vietnam, Cambodia (i.e., Cambodia), and Laos (i.e., Laos), and the completion of the merger of the Viet Lien and Viet Minh are the great political victories achieved by the Vietnamese people after many years of hard struggle. This victory is an extremely important blow to the French colonialists and the American imperialist interventionists' dream of creating division within Vietnam and reconquering Vietnam. Due to the brilliant victory of the united front, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of President Ho and the Labor Party, provide a solid guarantee for the achievements of the revolutionary armed struggle and revolutionary construction cause.

　　Looking back at the bloody road that the Vietnamese people have gone through since the French colonialists invaded Vietnam, we can find a valuable experience: to defeat the imperialists' aggression and win the victory of the national liberation struggle, all the Vietnamese people should unite in a broad and strong united front; to realize this great unity, there must be a national united front led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, including all progressive elements of all strata.

　　The rich experience of revolutionary struggle that the Chinese people have experienced in the past 30 years is the only model for the national liberation struggle in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and it is the only road that weak nations should take to get rid of the dark rule of imperialism and pursue freedom and light. Chairman Mao has clearly pointed out that the national united front is one of the three magic weapons of the revolution to oppose imperialist aggression, strive for independence, democracy, and peace, and achieve victory.

　　The Vietnamese working class and its political party—the Dongyang Communist Party, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, hold the magic weapon of the united front, so they can continue to move forward forever, not afraid of any difficulties, and achieve glorious victory.

　　In the future, all the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the vanguard of the Vietnamese working class—the Vietnam Labor Party, due to the increasing expansion of the armed struggle forces, due to the sympathy and assistance of the world peace and democracy camp led by Marshal Stalin to the Vietnamese people's war of resistance, we believe that the Viet Lien Front will certainly complete its glorious historical task, eliminate the French colonialists and American interventionists, and build a unified, independent, and democratic Vietnam in the big family of the world that loves peace and democracy.

　　越南民族统一阵线与越南人民革命事业
    ——纪念越南八月革命六周年
    越南人民访华代表团团长  黄国越
    八十多年来的越南历史是法国殖民主义者屠杀和剥削越南人民的血腥的罪恶史，同时也是越南人民英勇反抗帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立的斗争史。越南人民曾前仆后继坚贞不屈地以各式各样的斗争方式来抗击外侮。
    第一次世界大战以后，越南人民反抗法国帝国主义运动的领导权暂时地落在民族资产阶级及其政党——越南国民党——的手里（越南国民党成立于一九二七年）。但由于越南的民族资产阶级是无比地软弱，一九三○年二月由越南国民党领导的安湃起义失败后，越南国民党即告土崩瓦解，完全失却了领导作用。争取民族独立和解放的革命的领导权就落在日益发展的代表先进生产力的无产阶级及其政党——东洋共产党（即印度支那共产党）的身上，这个新生而富有朝气的党，是包括那些曾经长期而艰苦地在工厂和种植园与法国殖民者作无情斗争的工人和在法国、暹罗以及广州公社参加过实际革命斗争而久经锻炼的越南革命者。
    东洋共产党一登上越南的政治舞台，就以一种新的姿态出现。东洋共产党及其领袖胡志明曾明确地指出：过去斗争之所以失败，主要原因之一即是领导阶级不能建立起一个广泛而巩固的包括各阶层人民的统一组织，来发挥越南民族强大的潜在力量，走上正确的道路，与共同的敌人作斗争。东洋共产党一成立，即将建立以工农联盟为基础的民族统一战线排到主要的议事日程上去。
    为着完成反帝反封建的革命任务，东洋共产党始终不渝地按着人民的要求运用各种形式来组织统一战线。最初是采取与越南国民党共同组织反帝反封建的联盟（一九三○年至一九三一年），但由于联盟刚成立，没有制订共同遵守的纲领，且由于越南国民党的实行冒险主义导致安湃起义的失败，不仅使国民党从此一蹶不振，进而也影响到联盟组织形式的实现。
    一九三五年，德、意、日法西斯准备发动战争，反法西斯主义的浪潮遍及全世界，人民阵线在法国取得胜利，这个胜利直接有助于东洋共产党的扩展。东洋共产党立即发动大批干部深入民间，采取公开和半公开的活动方式，宣传并组织群众，发动一个全国性的“东洋人民大会”的运动，要求民主权利，与此同时并成立一个印度支那的民主统一战线，提出“有衣穿、有饭吃、自由、和平！”等口号，这个战线的成员包括工人、农民、小资产阶级及“现代派”（狭隘的国家主义的进步知识分子在当时所组织的学派）和法国社会党在越南的支部。民主阵线在东洋共产党灵活的领导下曾赢得许多民主权利。
    由于法国社会党右派的叛变，法国人民阵线遭受挫折而失败。一九三九年九月间第二次世界大战爆发，法国殖民主义者又施展其残酷而野蛮的镇压手段来摧残越南革命运动，各革命团体被迫转入地下。一九三九年十一月，东洋共产党号召越南人民积极起来组织反法西斯的民族统一战线。一九四○年六月间法国贝当政府向希特勒投降，三个月后在印度支那的法国殖民者向日寇屈膝，于是日寇进军印度支那。越南人民虽在日、法帝国主义者双重残酷压迫下，但东洋共产党领导越南人民斗争表现得比前更为积极与英勇。在这期间曾经爆发三次轰轰烈烈但因各种条件未臻成熟而告失败的武装起义，即一九四○年九月二十三日在北山的起义，同年十一月二十三日南圻的大暴动以及一九四一年一月十三日都梁地区的起义。一九四一年五月遵照胡志明同志及时的指导，在中国广西省某地召开包括五十位各革命团体的代表的会议，重新成立越南民族统一战线——越南独立同盟（简称越盟），积极领导越南人民作民族解放斗争，准备迎接胜利，夺回人民政权。
    越盟是一个全越各爱国党派、各阶层的爱国团体共同结合而成的民族统一战线，包括东洋共产党，各工农团体及青年、妇女、文化、父老与宗教等救国会，到一九四四年六月，越南民主党也参加这个阵线。
    为了击败两个主要敌人——日、法帝国主义者，越盟实行了具有历史意义的土地政策，实行减租减息，没收法殖民主义者及越奸的土地，暂时分配给贫雇农，合理使用公田，以便改善农民生活；另一方面，即集中全民力量以实现当前主要而急迫的反帝任务。
    越盟自成立后即发动“反法驱日”的运动，有计划有步骤地在全国各地发展游击战，首先在越北建立革命根据地。一九四四年十二月二十二日，越南解放军初次在越南土地上出现，使越南人民的武装斗争进入一个新的阶段。正如东洋共产党所预见的，法、日帝国主义的矛盾发展到极度尖锐的时候是会发生军事冲突的，因之也会给越南革命创造有利的条件的。一九四五年三月九日，日本军队把法国军队全部缴械。从“三九事变”以后，越盟所发动的抗日救国高潮在全国各地汹涌起来。一九四五年八月十五日，越盟总部在宣光省的新潮召开全越国民代表大会，选出民族解放委员会，并按照东洋共产党所预定的计划，发动全国武装总起义，夺取政权。四天后，“八月革命”在首都河内爆发，全国各地区夺取政权也先后宣告成功。一九四五年九月二日，以胡志明同志为主席的越南民主共和国诞生了！越盟阵线在东洋共产党领导下为祖国争取独立，为人民争取民主，并向全越人民明显地指出建设一条繁荣富强的民主国家应走的康庄大道。
    革命刚获得初步的胜利，新的困难就接踵而来。
    一九四五年九月二十三日，英帝国主义的军队登陆越南南部并带来大批法军重新侵略越南，而蒋介石匪军即占据北纬十六度以北所有地区，“越南革命同盟”和“越南国民党”的反动分子伴随着蒋匪军进入越南，大肆骚扰。那时越南人民的处境是艰危的，任务是繁重的。在这内外交迫的危机面前，民族统一战线不能只包括已有的各个革命团体，而且需要更进一步争取各阶层中一切可能争取的爱国力量，以便对抗敌伪的挑拨离间、阴谋分裂民族的毒策。因此，在一九四六年五月二十七日，“越南国民联合会”（简称越联）宣布成立。这是使民族统一战线更广泛而全面发展且适应当时形势的需要而建立起来的。越盟加入越联作为越联阵线有力的支柱，发生骨干作用，此外，越联还吸收了越南革命同盟和越南国民党中的进步分子和一九四五年以后成立的群众团体，如：越南总工会、越南文化协会、越南妇女联合会、越南民主青年联合会、越南学生联合会及越南马克思主义研究会。越联因而成为团结全越各党派、各民族、各阶层、各宗教、各人民团体以及无党派的爱国人士的群众性的广泛组织。
    为适应客观形势的发展，一九四八年十一月七日，越盟总部表示了与越联统一组织的愿望。当时所有在统一战线中的各级干部，都朝着这个方向努力。今年三月间，当越南劳动党成立后，接着越联越盟的统一大会也召开了，并顺利地完成了合并手续，建立了“越南国民协联战线”（简称越联阵线），成为越南有史以来最广大与最坚强有力的阵线。二千一百万越南人民一条心地信仰着胡志明主席和工人阶级的政党——越南劳动党的英明正确的领导，相信以自己团结的力量与坚决的战斗意志必将消灭法国殖民者和美国干涉者以及它们的走狗——卖国的越奸们，争取民族独立、人民民主的彻底实现，并对保卫世界和平的事业有所贡献。
    无可否认地，过去的各种形式的统一战线，对越南革命运动有着推进的作用。特别是越盟阵线，它已在越南人民的革命战斗史上写下了光辉的一页——令人不能遗忘的日子——一九四五年八月十九日。
    承继并发挥越盟的革命传统精神，越联阵线今天已成为一个强有力的政治部队，它将推动抗战赢得完全的胜利。越南劳动党成立，越棉（即柬埔寨）寮（即老挝）三民族结成兄弟般的联盟和越联越盟完成合并，三者是越南人民经过多少年艰苦战斗后在政治上所获得的伟大胜利。这个胜利对于法国殖民主义者及美帝国主义干涉者梦想在越南内部制造分裂、重新征服越南的各种阴谋毒策是一个极其重大的打击。由于统一战线的辉煌的胜利，越南人民在胡主席和劳动党领导之下，为革命武装斗争和革命建设事业的成就提供稳固的保证。
    回顾过去从法国殖民主义者侵越以来、越南人民所经过的血迹斑斑的道路，我们可以找出一个宝贵的经验：就是要击败帝国主义者的侵略，争取民族解放斗争的胜利，越南全体人民应团结在一个广泛和坚强的统一战线里面；要实现这个大团结，必须有一个以工人阶级为领导以工农联盟为基础的包括各阶层所有的进步分子的民族统一战线。
    中国人民三十年来所经历的丰富的革命斗争经验，就是殖民地半殖民地民族解放斗争唯一的楷模，是弱小民族要摆脱帝国主义的黑暗统治而追求自由光明应走的唯一的道路。毛主席已经明确地指出：民族统一战线是反对帝国主义侵略、争取独立民主和平取得胜利的革命三大法宝之一。
    越南工人阶级及其政党——东洋共产党，在胡志明主席的领导下，掌握着统一战线的法宝，因此能永远继续前进，不怕任何困难而获得光荣的胜利。
    今后越南全体人民在越南工人阶级的先锋队——越南劳动党的领导之下，由于武装斗争力量的日益扩展，由于在斯大林大元帅领导下的世界和平民主阵营对越南人民抗战的同情与援助，我们相信越联阵线一定能完成它的光荣的历史任务，消灭法国殖民主义者与美国干涉者，在世界爱好和平与民主的大家庭中建设起一个统一独立和民主的越南。
