To the Volunteer Army

A Letter from the Township Cadres of Jingouzhai Township, Muping County, Shandong Province, to Volunteer Army Hero Lü Songshan

Dear Comrade Songshan:

Your heroic deeds on the Korean battlefield last year, earning you the glorious title of "One-Man Hero," have spread throughout the country. On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth lunar month, the masses in our village held a celebration meeting for you. The county and district sent banners, congratulatory scrolls, and a large plaque inscribed with "One-Man Hero." Students from Muping and Yantai organized Yangko and flower drum teams to celebrate. The masses from various villages sent many慰劳品 [comfort items]. That day, our village was extremely lively. Comrade Songshan, your glory has brought boundless glory to our entire village. Your bravery has further strengthened the will of our village people to resist America and aid Korea. The masses in our village are determined to learn from you. Our village has established a patriotic pact, unanimously stating: Resolutely respond to the call of the higher authorities, do a good job in production and substitute farming, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, consolidate the militia organization, and defend the coast. Comrade Songshan, this year our village has made achievements in these areas. This year's wheat harvest is more than 16,000 jin greater than last year's; from January to July, fisheries production earned more than 33.7 million yuan (excluding the small-scale sea catch), and the people's lives have improved. Our village has organized a militia, which stands guard on the coast every day to protect the people's safety. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, our village exposed five counter-revolutionaries, including Lü Kekun and Lü Qiqu, and reported them to the government, which executed them according to law. This is truly gratifying!

However, our village's work still has many shortcomings. In addition to making a deep self-criticism, we are determined to learn from you. In the future, we will change our coercive command style, lead the masses to do a good job in resisting America and aiding Korea, and ensure that we have the people, the grain, and the money needed. At present, we are conducting an in-depth review and revision of the patriotic pact, combining it with the publicity of the ten major production policies, and leading the masses to organize to further improve agricultural and fisheries production. We must also do a good job in substitute farming, making sure it's done as well as farming our own land. The coastal defense work must also be continuously strengthened. Now is the time to pay the public grain, and we guarantee to pay it well, pay it in full, and pay with dry grain. During the "August 1st" Army Day, we will also hold a celebration meeting for you.

Comrade Songshan, let us at the front and in the rear work together to resist America and aid Korea, strive to defeat the American devils as soon as possible, and defend our motherland and our happy life.

Yours,
Lü Qizhi and nine others, Deputy Township Head of Jingouzhai Township, Muping County, Shandong Province
July 19th

　　写给志愿军
    山东牟平县金沟寨乡乡干部给志愿军英雄吕松山的一封信
    亲爱的松山同志：
    去年你在朝鲜战场上英勇杀敌，获得“独胆英雄”光荣称号的事迹，传遍了全国各地。腊月二十七日，咱村群众为你开了庆功大会。县里、区上给你送来了锦标、贺幛和写着“独胆英雄”的大匾。牟平、烟台的学生，组织了秧歌队和花鼓队来庆功。各村群众送来了许多慰劳品。那天，咱村热闹极了。松山同志，你一人的光荣，给咱全村带来了无限的光荣。你的英勇，更加强了咱村人民抗美援朝的意志。全村群众决心向你学习，咱村订立了爱国公约，一致表示：坚决响应上级号召，搞好生产和代耕工作，坚决镇压反革命，巩固民兵组织，保卫海防。松山同志，今年来咱村这些工作都是有成绩的。今年的小麦比去年可多收一万六千多斤；渔业生产从一月到七月赚钱三千三百七十多万元（赶小海还未统计在内），群众的生活改善了。咱村组织了民兵，每天在海边站岗放哨，保障人民的安全。在镇压反革命运动中，咱村检举了吕克坤、吕其趣等五个反革命分子，报告政府依法把他们枪决了，这真是大快人心啊！
    可是，咱村的工作还有许多缺点，我们除了作深刻的检讨以外，并决心向你学习，今后要改变强迫命令作风，领导群众做好抗美援朝工作，做到要人有人，要粮有粮，要钱有钱。眼前我们正深入检查修订爱国公约，结合宣传生产十大政策，领导群众组织起来，把农、渔业生产提高一步。还要把代耕工作作好，做到和自己种的地一样。保卫海防工作也要继续加强。眼下就要缴纳公粮，我们保证做到缴好、缴足、缴干粮。“八一”节的时候，我们还要给你开会庆功。
    松山同志，咱们前方后方共同努力抗美援朝，争取早日打垮美国鬼子，保卫祖国，保卫咱们的幸福生活。
                              山东牟平县金沟寨乡副乡长吕其志等九人
                                                七月十九日
