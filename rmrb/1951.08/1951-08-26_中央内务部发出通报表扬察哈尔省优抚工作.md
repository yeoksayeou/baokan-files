The Central Ministry of Internal Affairs Issues Circular Commending Chahar Province's Work on Preferential Treatment

[This newspaper dispatch] The Central People's Government's Ministry of Internal Affairs recently issued a circular regarding the commendation of the Chahar Provincial leading organs for their attention to preferential treatment work. The circular stated: The Chahar Provincial leading organs pay attention to preferential treatment work. This spring, the Provincial People's Government issued two directives on launching a campaign to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers and on doing a good job in providing substitute farming for families of soldiers. In April, two working groups were organized to inspect preferential treatment work in Datong and Xuanhua counties. After the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea issued its three major appeals on June 1, it further aroused the attention of the Chahar Provincial leading organs. On June 12, the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs convened a meeting of commissioners and county civil affairs section chiefs to specifically discuss issues related to improving preferential treatment work. On June 16, the Provincial Government convened a symposium on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment at the provincial level. At the meeting, Chairman Zhang Su summarized the preferential treatment work of the past six months and pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen leadership in the future and regard preferential treatment work as a major political task to consolidate national defense and consolidate the troops. Relevant government departments should establish regular meetings and everyone should be jointly responsible for doing a good job in preferential treatment work, instead of relying solely on the civil affairs departments. It is necessary to combine the current movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to educate the broad masses and earnestly do a good job in preferential treatment work. In rural areas, it is necessary to ensure that "every family cultivates the land well," and in cities, it is necessary to ensure that "every household has a job," so that the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers are not lower than the living standards of the local people. It is necessary to launch a labor model award movement for the families of martyrs and soldiers and properly distribute preferential treatment grain. The families of meritorious personnel should be congratulated and celebrated in a timely manner, and soldiers' families and the masses should be mobilized to write letters to the soldiers at the front. At the meeting, the Provincial Health Bureau, the Cooperative General Society, the Bank, the Education Department, and other departments reviewed their work on preferential treatment and formulated plans for improvement.

After the meeting, the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government issued the "Instructions on Conscientiously Doing a Good Job in Preferential Treatment Work." The Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Youth Federation, and the Women's Federation also issued instructions and appeals to do a good job in preferential treatment work. The Provincial Health Bureau drafted measures to reduce or exempt medical expenses for the families of martyrs and soldiers, stipulating that public hospitals should exempt registration fees for the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers. When poor families of martyrs and soldiers need to be hospitalized after examination, medical and accommodation expenses may be exempted or reduced. Epidemic prevention teams should provide free medical treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers in the countryside. It also called on private medical businesses to charge the cost price at most when providing medical treatment and selling medicine to the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Society issued the "Instructions on the Cooperative System Paying Attention to Cooperating in Giving Preferential Treatment to the Families of Martyrs, Soldiers, and Workers," proposing that cooperative departments should vigorously absorb the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers into the cooperatives and support their production through business operations. In purchasing goods, selling goods, and hiring workers for processing, priority should be given to the families of martyrs and soldiers. During the New Year, the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the Dragon Boat Festival, the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers who have not yet joined the cooperative should also be given preferential treatment. At the end of the year, the grassroots cooperatives may, after discussion and approval by the representative meeting, withdraw 20% of the public welfare fund to be used for preferential treatment to the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers in the village. The Chahar Branch of the People's Bank of China issued the "Instructions on Doing a Good Job in Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to the Families of Soldiers," stipulating that the bank should give priority to lending agricultural and sideline production loans to the families of martyrs and soldiers under the same conditions. When the families of martyrs and soldiers need to remit money for living expenses, the remittance fee should be waived with the certification of the village office. The children of the families of martyrs and soldiers who are willing to participate in banking work should be absorbed as much as possible as long as they meet the conditions. The monthly rural financial work reports made by each sub-branch office should include the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers as a content.

Under the promotion of the provincial government, the leading organs of each special district and county generally held meetings to review and deploy preferential treatment work and conducted in-depth inspections of the implementation status, and decided to vigorously implement the preferential treatment policies.

The circular concluded: Due to the attention of the Chahar Provincial leading organs to preferential treatment work, the heads are responsible for promoting the joint efforts of relevant departments (banks, cooperatives, health departments, etc.) and people's organizations, and they have conducted reviews and formulated improvement measures, thus forming a mass movement in which everyone participates in preferential treatment work.

　　中央内务部发出通报表扬察哈尔省优抚工作
    【本报讯】中央人民政府内务部顷发出关于表扬察哈尔省领导机关重视优抚工作的通报。通报称：察哈尔省领导机关对优抚工作是重视的。今春该省人民政府曾两次发出关于开展拥军优属运动与作好优属代耕工作的指示。四月间，组织了两个工作组到大同、宣化两县检查优抚工作。六月一日抗美援朝总会发出三大号召后，更引起察哈尔省领导机关的注意。六月十二日，省府民政厅召开专署、县民政科长会议，专门讨论改进优抚工作的问题。六月十六日，省府又召开省一级拥军优抚座谈会。会上，张苏主席总结了半年来的优抚工作，指出今后必须加强领导，把优抚工作当作巩固国防，巩固部队的重大政治任务，政府各有关部门要建立定期会议，大家共同负责做好优抚工作，而不是光靠民政部门。要结合当前抗美援朝运动，教育广大群众，认真作好优抚工作。在农村要作到“家家种好地”，城市作到“户户有职业”，使烈军属的生活不比当地人民的生活水平低。要开展烈军属劳动模范评奖运动，妥善发放优抚粮。对功臣家属要及时贺功贺喜，动员军属和群众给前线战士写信。会上，省卫生局、合作总社、银行、教育等部门对优抚工作均进行了检讨，并订出改进计划。
    会后，中共察哈尔省委、省人民政府均发出《关于认真作好优抚工作的指示》。省总工会、青年联合会、妇女联合会亦发出作好优抚工作的指示和号召。省卫生局拟出烈军属减免医药费的办法，规定：公立医院对烈军属和革命残废军人免收挂号费，贫苦烈军属经检查需要住院时，医药住宿费可用免收或减收。防疫队到乡村给烈军属治病一律免费。并号召私营医药业为烈军属和革命残废军人看病、售药时顶多只收成本费等。省供销合作总社发出《关于合作系统注意配合优待烈军工属的指示》，提出合作部门要大力吸收烈军工属入社，通过经营业务扶助他们的生产。在购货、销货、雇工加工时，对烈军属优先照顾。年节，中秋节，端午节时，对尚未入社的烈军工属同样优待。基层社在年底结账时可经代表会讨论通过，抽出公益金百分之二十作为优待本村烈军工属之用。中国人民银行察哈尔分行发出《关于作好拥军优属工作的指示》，规定银行出贷农业和副业生产贷款时，在同样条件下优先贷给烈军属。烈军属在生活费用上需要汇款时，经村公所证明免收汇费。烈军属子弟愿参加银行工作者，只要够条件即应尽量吸收。各支行办事处每月所做农村金融工作报告，应将拥军优属工作列为一项内容。
    各专区、县领导机关在省府的推动下，一般均召开了会议，对优抚工作做了检讨、布置，并对执行状况进行了深入的检查，决大力贯彻优抚政策。
    通报最后称：由于察哈尔省领导机关重视优抚工作，首长负责推动各有关部门（银行、合作社、卫生等部门）和人民团体协同进行，并分别进行了检讨，订出改进办法，因而使优抚工作形成大家动手的群众运动。
