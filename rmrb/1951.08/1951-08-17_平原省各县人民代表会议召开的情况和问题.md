Editor's note: Pingyuan Province's summary of the situation and problems of people's representative conferences in various counties is of universal significance; their experience is worthy of attention. This summary can prove that the general situation of people's representative conferences in North China is constantly improving; however, some counties and districts have fairly serious problems and shortcomings, which must be corrected at present.

The people's representative conferences of all circles in various counties of Pingyuan Province have been held four to nine times. Most counties have held two to three times this year, and a few counties have held once, and the second time is being held (only Jiyuan and Chaocheng counties are exercising the functions and powers of the people's congress). Most counties can seize the central task of each period and the demands of the broad masses, and hold meetings in a timely manner. The convening of previous meetings has played a great role in promoting work and changing the style of leadership. In particular, since the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries, there has been further improvement. This is manifested in:

(1) The representativeness of the representatives is unprecedentedly broad. This is because: First, the political direction is clear, and it itself represents the demands of the broad masses. Second, with the development of work, new components have been continuously added, such as labor models, mutual assistance, cooperation, water conservancy, demobilized soldiers, industry and commerce, handicraftsmen, fishermen, textile workers, and disaster victims. Jiaxiang County invited three former Qing Dynasty scholars in their eighties to participate, and they said that they would use their "three-inch incorruptible tongues to publicize the resistance to US aggression and aid Korea." Third, the number of elected representatives has increased compared with the past. According to statistics from 28 counties, there are a total of 7,173 representatives, of which 63 percent were elected, 22 percent were recommended, and 12 percent were invited. Therefore, the representatives have further established close contact with the masses.

(2) Through the situation report, enlightening the recollection of the atrocities of the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the comparison between the front and the rear, the consciousness has been further improved. Farmer representatives proposed "more hoeing, more harrowing, more fertilization, eliminating pests, ensuring bumper harvests, and donating planes and cannons"; the business community proposed "paying taxes in advance"; and the youth expressed "waiting for the motherland's call." This year's summer grain requisition was unprecedentedly smooth, with many counties completing the requisition in one day without any arrears; some representatives reported that "they will pay more wheat grain this year and clear it in one season."

(3) Discussing the list of counter-revolutionaries through the people's representative conference and establishing a case-clearing committee with the participation of representatives from all walks of life is a good method for comprehensively implementing policies and deeply mobilizing the masses. The benefits of doing so are: First, the policies directly meet the masses, are mastered by the masses, and the masses' political consciousness is greatly improved through self-education, and the struggle against the enemy is more active. Second, the distinction between leniency and severity is clearer, further dividing the enemy. Third, concentrating the opinions of the broad masses can prevent deviations in the leadership's sentencing.

In the future, the experience of electing representatives to form various specialized committees can continue to be used.

(4) After the people's representative conference makes resolutions on the central work, the departments convene various professional conferences to implement them, which is a very good method. For example, Xiuwu, Fengqiu, and other counties convened representatives' meetings and forums of propagandists, militiamen, mutual aid groups, water conservancy workers, cotton farmers, and technicians, systematically implementing the resolutions of the county's people's representative conference, not only clarifying the content, deeply implementing specific policies, and solving practical problems, but also exchanging experiences to help the leadership clarify the situation.

(5) The handling of proposals should grasp three points: First, the leadership should understand the demands of the masses in advance and mobilize the masses to study solutions. In this way, it not only reflects the demands of the masses, but also improves the consciousness of the masses. Second, classify the proposals according to their content, and let the relevant representatives from all walks of life discuss and put forward opinions, and then submit them to all representatives for discussion before handing them over to the relevant departments for handling. This method is more welcomed by the representatives than the method of unified answers by the review committee. Third, once adopted, organize forces to implement them seriously.

However, some counties and districts do not fully understand that after having a clear political direction, the important thing is still to follow the mass line. Therefore, these counties and districts still neglect the role of the people's representative conference, which is extremely inconsistent with the people's democratic demands and enthusiasm for managing state affairs. The main problems are:

(1) Some counties do not bring major issues to the people's representative conference for discussion, and only pay attention to trivial matters such as entertaining representatives for meals, or only pay attention to specific seasonal work, and do not pay enough attention to how to raise the representatives' awareness to the level of national policy in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and the patriotic bumper harvest movement. For example, Fan County, Dongming, and other counties have not yet handed over the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to the people's representative conference for discussion. In the resolution of Fan County, the procedures for wheat requisition are very specific, but no resolution was made on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. After the people's representative conference in Dongming County was over, the representatives said: "The masses reflect that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries has passed like a gust of wind, and we representatives don't know about it."

(2) Belittling the role of the people's representative conference: Some cadres still have the phenomenon of using representatives as cadres, calling people and sending things to representatives, so the representatives said: "Whoever becomes a representative, whoever has trouble!" As a result, some counties are "not as good as the first one." Some even believe that the work is easier to do now, and the task can be completed without holding a people's representative conference, believing that "the representatives only play a propaganda role, and the village cadres still do the real thing," "it is too troublesome to hold a representative conference, it is better to have a village cadre conference." Some are merged with the village cadre conference, nominally a people's representative conference, but in reality it is a village cadre conference.

(3) Some areas still do not pay attention to the district people's representative conference and the village people's representative conference. According to statistics from 271 districts in four special districts, 44 districts have never held one, 88 districts have only held one or two, and 139 districts have held three to six. More were held last year, and fewer this year. Puyang and Liaocheng special districts have not held any this year. As for the village people's representative conference, according to last year's statistics, 90 percent of the villages have been established, of which 80 percent elected the village government. However, formalism is serious. According to surveys in Xinxiang and other counties, 30 percent are not effective. The main reason is that district cadres lack understanding of this, believing that "it is better to solve problems with a package of village cadre meetings," and the convening of representative meetings is not much different from village cadre meetings. The leadership also does not pay enough attention to this. In the future, changing the thinking and style of cadres and holding good district people's representative conferences and village people's representative conferences is still an arduous and important task.

(4) Some areas still do not recognize the active role of the people's representative conference in improving the style of cadres, and show a lack of attention or inability to conduct democratic consultation. Some proposals are not checked after being answered, or not answered at all, resulting in fewer and fewer proposals. For example, in Yuncheng County with a population of more than 600,000, there are only three proposals; some counties believe that "the fact that there are fewer proposals on the style of cadres means that the style of cadres has changed and there is no problem." Because many counties did not conduct inspections on the style of work at the representative conference this year, commandism has developed again in the case of smooth work. This is what we must be vigilant about.

Based on the above situation, we believe that the work of people's representative conferences at all levels should be improved in the following aspects: (1) With the upsurge of the masses' enthusiasm for production and political consciousness, their democratic demands are also further rising, so leaders at all levels must strengthen the leadership of the people's representative conference and institutionalize it. Those with the conditions can choose key counties to convene people's representative conferences of all circles exercising the functions and powers of the people's congress to gain experience and further give full play to the enthusiasm of the people. (2) Since the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the people's democratic united front has become more consolidated. In the future, we should pay more attention to the unity of the people from all walks of life, and overcome the thinking of some cadres who neglect the work of the united front due to the high emotions of the masses. (3) People's representative conferences at all levels should be fixed as a system and should not be held less often. The implementation of policies and the ideological style of cadres should also be checked regularly with the convening of the people's representative conference, and should not be tight and loose at times. The people's representative conferences of all circles in the county should generally set up permanent organs to closely contact the representatives. In the past, representatives were re-elected every time, and it was difficult to implement (some counties did not implement it). We believe that regular re-election is appropriate. (4) The district people's representative conference and the village people's representative conference must be strengthened in the future.

　　平原省各县人民代表会议召开的情况和问题
    中共平原省委政策研究室
    编者按：平原省总结各县人民代表会议的情况和问题，是有普遍意义的；他们的经验很值得重视。这个总结可以证明，华北各地人民代表会议，在发展中的一般情况是不断有进步的；但有些县区则存在着相当严重的问题和缺点，这就是目前所必须加以纠正的。
    平原省各县各界人民代表会议，都已开过四次至九次。今年大部县开过二至三次，少数县开过一次，第二次正在召开（代行人民代表大会职权者只有济源、朝城两县）。多数县都能抓住每一时期工作中心与广大群众要求，及时召开。历次会议的召开，对推动工作、转变领导作风，都起了很大作用。特别是从抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动以来，又有进一步的提高。这表现在：
    （一）代表的代表性空前广泛。这是因为：第一、政治方向明确，本身就代表了广大群众的要求。第二、随着工作发展，不断增加了新的成份，如劳动模范、互助、合作、水利、复员军人、工商、手工业者、渔民、纺织、灾民等，嘉祥县邀请了三个八十多岁的前清秀才参加，他们表示要以“三寸不烂之舌，宣传抗美援朝”。第三、选举的代表较前增加，据二十八个县统计，共有代表七、一七三人，选举的占百分之六十三，推选占百分之二十二，邀请的占百分之十二。因此，代表进一步与群众取得了密切联系。
    （二）通过形势报告，启发回忆日寇、蒋匪暴行，前后方对比，觉悟有了进一步提高。农民代表提出“多锄、多耙、多施肥，消灭虫害，保证丰产，捐献飞机大炮”；工商界提出“提前缴纳税款”；青年表示“听候祖国召唤”。今年夏征空前顺利，不少县一天征齐，没有尾欠；有的代表自报“今年多交麦粮，一季交清”。
    （三）通过人民代表会议讨论反革命名单，成立各界代表参加的清案委员会，是全面贯彻政策，深入发动群众的良好方法。这样作的好处是：第一、政策直接和群众见面，为群众所掌握，群众经过自我教育，政治觉悟大大提高，对敌斗争更加积极。第二、宽严分明，更加分化了敌人。第三、集中广大群众意见，可以防止领导量刑的偏差。
    今后对由代表选举，成立各种专门委员会的经验，可继续使用。
    （四）人民代表会议上对中心工作作出决议之后，由部门分别召开各种专业会议贯彻，是一个很好的方法。如修武、封邱等县，召开宣传员、民兵、互助、水利、棉农、技术等代表会与座谈会，系统地贯彻了县各界人民代表会议决议，不只是内容明确、深入贯彻具体政策，解决问题具体实际；还可交流经验，帮助领导澄清情况。
    （五）对提案处理，应掌握三点：一是领导事先了解群众要求，发动群众研究解决办法。如此，既反映了群众要求，又提高了群众觉悟。二是按照提案内容分类，由有关各界代表讨论提出意见，经全体代表讨论后，再交有关部门办理。这样，比由审查委员会统一解答的办法更为代表所欢迎。三是既经通过，就组织力量认真贯彻。
    但有些县、区还不完全懂得，有了明确政治方向之后，重要的还必须走群众路线。因此，这些县区仍有忽视人民代表会议作用的，这与群众管理国家大事的民主要求和热情的提高是极不相称的。这些问题主要的是：
    （一）有些县，不把重大问题拿到人民代表会议讨论，只注意招待代表吃饭等细枝末节或只注意季节性的具体工作，对如何在抗美援朝、镇压反革命、爱国主义丰产运动中，把代表的觉悟提高到国家政策的水平，则注意不够。如范县、东明等县，至今没有把镇压反革命交给人民代表会议讨论，范县决议中，麦征手续办法很具体，抗美援朝则未作任何决议。东明县人民代表会议开完了，可是代表说：“群众反映镇压反革命一阵风过去了，俺代表也不知道。”
    （二）轻视人民代表会议的作用：有些干部仍有把代表当干部使用的现象，开会叫人、派东西都找代表，因此代表说：“谁当代表，谁麻烦！”以致有的县“一次不如一次开的好”。甚至认为现在工作好办了，不开人民代表会议也可以完成任务，认为“代表只起个宣传作用，办真事还是村干部”，“开代表会太麻烦，不如村干部会”。有的则与村的干部会合并召开，名为人民代表会议，实为村干部会。
    （三）有些地区对区人民代表会议、村人民代表会议至今还未重视。据四个专区二百七十一个区的统计，有四十四个区至今根本没有开过，八十八个区只开了一次或二次，一百三十九个区开过三次至六次。去年开的较多，今年开的较少。濮阳、聊城两专区，今年则全未召开。至于村人民代表会议，据去年统计，百分之九十的村子已建立，其中选举村政府者占百分之八十。但形式主义严重，据新乡等县调查，百分之三十不起作用。其原因，主要是区干部对此缺乏认识，认为“不如一揽子村干部会解决问题”，召开代表会亦与村干部会没大分别。领导上对此也重视不够。今后转变干部思想与作风，开好区人民代表会议、村人民代表会议，还是一个艰巨而又必须重视的工作。
    （四）有些地区还不认识人民代表会议对改进干部作风的积极作用，表现了不重视或不善于进行民主协商。有的提案解答了不检查，或根本不解答，致提案越来越少。如郓城县六十多万人口，提案少到只有三个；有的县则认为“对干部作风提案少了，就是干部作风已经转变了，没问题了。”由于今年不少县没有在代表会议上进行作风的检查，命令主义作风在工作顺利的情况下又有新发展。这是我们必须警惕的。
    根据以上情况，我们认为，各级人民代表会议工作，应从以下几方面注意提高：（一）随着群众生产热情、政治觉悟的高涨，其民主要求亦进一步高涨，因而各级领导必须加强人民代表会议的领导，使之制度化。凡是条件具备者，可选择重点县，召开代行人民代表大会职权的各界人民代表会议，以取得经验，进一步充分发挥人民的积极性。（二）镇压反革命运动以来，人民民主统一战线更趋于巩固，今后更应注意对各界人民的团结，对某些干部由于群众情绪高而产生的忽视统一战线工作的思想，应加以克服。（三）各级人民代表会议应定为制度，不许少开。对政策执行情况、干部思想作风，亦应随人民代表会议之召开，定期进行检查，不可时紧时松。县各界人民代表会议，应普遍设立常驻机关，密切与代表联系。过去代表每次一改选，很难执行（有些县就没有执行），我们认为以定期改选为宜。（四）区人民代表会议、村人民代表会议，今后必须注意加强。
