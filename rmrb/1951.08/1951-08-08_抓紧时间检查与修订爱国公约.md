　　Hasten the Inspection and Revision of Patriotic Pacts

    In the proclamation issued by this association on July 4th calling on the people of the whole country to continue strengthening the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, it was requested that the people of all circles in all parts of the country "further popularize and deepen the Patriotic Pact movement, so that the number of people participating in the signing of Patriotic Pacts will be increased as much as possible, the content of the Patriotic Pacts will be more specific, and this work will be universally inspected once in July, and then improved and promoted based on the results of the inspection." Now July has passed, and according to the materials received by this association, many regions and units have conducted or have begun to conduct the inspection work of the Patriotic Pact. However, there are still many regions and units that have not yet started this work, and many places and units have failed to complete this work as scheduled, or have not yet summarized the results of the inspection. We hope that the organizations at all levels of this association must seize the time, cooperate with the party committees at all levels of the Communist Party of China and various people's organizations, complete the universal inspection work of the Patriotic Pact in August, and summarize experience and promote it.

    According to reports from various places, the main problems existing in the Patriotic Pact movement now are: First, the development of the movement is not yet universal. Some cities, such as Ganzhou and Shangrao, have more than 90% of people from all walks of life signing Patriotic Pacts; other cities, such as Beijing and Nanjing, have the number of people participating in the signing of Patriotic Pacts reaching about 60% of the city's population. However, there are still many cities and provinces where only a minority of the entire population has signed Patriotic Pacts. For example, in Heilongjiang Province, the number of people who have signed Patriotic Pacts accounts for only a quarter of the province's population. Second, many Patriotic Pacts, because the units signing the pact are too large, or because they have not been carefully deliberated and discussed by the masses when signing the pact, are not specific enough in content, making it impossible to implement them specifically and inspect them regularly. Third, many units did not simultaneously elect leaders and establish a regular leadership core to lead everyone to realize these pacts when signing Patriotic Pacts. Therefore, there was no inspection and supervision after the signing, resulting in the loss of the role of organizing and educating the masses.

    The purpose of this inspection of the Patriotic Pact is to overcome the above-mentioned three shortcomings, so that the Patriotic Pact movement can develop universally and deeply.

    The Patriotic Pact is an important form for people of all strata to unite under the banner of patriotism and carry out long-term self-education. Its content should be the current central patriotic tasks of the people of the whole country, including the codification of the current Resist America, Aid Korea work. The Patriotic Pact serves the central work, and it should never be an isolated thing. Therefore, some regions juxtapose the work of promoting the Patriotic Pact with the current central work, and Resist America, Aid Korea work such as donating weapons and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, or use the excuse that there is too much central work and do not promote the Patriotic Pact. These ideas and practices are completely wrong. Therefore, the inspection of the Patriotic Pact should not be carried out in isolation, but should also check whether the masses of each signing unit have consciously and actively completed the country's current central work (including various Resist America, Aid Korea work). Secondly, it should not only check the degree of implementation of the Patriotic Pact signed in the past, but should also lead the masses to supplement and revise the original pact after inspecting the Patriotic Pact, based on the changes in the current central work and the improvement of the awareness of each signing unit. Only in this way can this inspection of the Patriotic Pact movement become a driving force for promoting the donation of weapons, preferential treatment of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and other central work.

    To do a good job in the inspection of the Patriotic Pact so that the Patriotic Pact movement can move forward, strong leadership is indispensable. We hope that the responsible comrades of the leading organs and people's organizations in various places will conscientiously grasp the leadership of this work, and at the same time as universally and systematically deploying this work, they will personally go deep into two or three lower-level units to directly lead the masses to inspect and revise the Patriotic Pact, in order to gain experience and promote it.

### 抓紧时间检查与修订爱国公约

　　抓紧时间检查与修订爱国公约
    本会在七月四日发出的号召全国人民继续加强抗美援朝运动的文告中，曾经要求全国各地各界人民“进一步普及和深入爱国公约运动，使参加订立爱国公约的人数尽量增多，爱国公约的内容更加具体，并且在七月份内把这一工作普遍检查一次，然后根据检查的结果，对这一工作加以改进和推广”。现在七月份已经过去了，根据本会所收到的材料看来，许多地区许多单位已经进行了或已经开始进行爱国公约的检查工作，但是还有不少地区不少单位尚未开始进行这个工作，另有许多地方和单位未能如期完成这一工作，或者尚未将检查的结果加以总结。我们希望本会各级组织，务须抓紧时间，配合中国共产党的各级党委会、各人民团体，在八月份内完成爱国公约的普遍检查工作，并总结经验，加以推广。
    根据各地的报告，现在爱国公约运动中存在的主要问题是：第一，运动的发展还不普遍。有些城市例如赣州、上饶，各界人民已有百分之九十以上订立了爱国公约；另有一些城市，例如北京、南京，参加订立爱国公约的人数已经达到全市人口百分之六十左右。但是还有许多城市和省区，已经订立爱国公约的在全体人民中还只是少数，例如黑龙江省，已经订立爱国公约的人数只占全省人口四分之一。第二，许多爱国公约，因为订约的单位太大，或者因为订约时没有经过群众的认真酝酿、讨论，以致内容不够具体，无法具体执行和定期检查。第三，许多单位在订立爱国公约时，没有同时选出领导人，建立经常的领导核心，领导大家来实现这些公约，因此，订立后没有检查督促，以致失去组织和教育群众的作用。
    这次检查爱国公约的目的，就是为了克服上面所说的三个缺点，使爱国公约运动能够普遍、深入地发展。
    爱国公约是各阶层人民在爱国主义的旗帜下团结起来长期进行自我教育的重要形式，它的内容应该是全国人民的当前中心的爱国任务，包括当前的各项抗美援朝工作的条文化。爱国公约是为中心工作服务的，它决不应该是孤立的东西。因此，有些地区把推行爱国公约的工作和当前中心工作，和捐献武器、优抚烈属军属等项抗美援朝工作对立起来，或者借口中心工作多而不去推行爱国公约，这些想法和做法都是完全不对的。也就因此，不应该孤立地进行爱国公约的检查，而应该同时检查各订约单位的群众是否已经自觉地积极地完成国家的当前中心工作（包括各项抗美援朝工作）。其次，不应该仅仅检查过去所订立的爱国公约的执行程度，而应该根据当前的中心工作的变化和各订约单位觉悟程度的提高，在检查爱国公约之后，领导群众补充和修订原有的公约。只有这样做，才能使这次检查爱国公约运动，成为推进捐献武器、优待烈属军属以及其他各项中心工作的动力。
    要做好爱国公约的检查工作，以使爱国公约运动前进一步，没有强有力的领导是不行的。我们希望各地领导机关和人民团体的负责同志认真抓紧对这个工作的领导，在普遍地、有系统地布置这个工作时，同时亲自深入二三个下层单位，直接领导群众检查和修订爱国公约，以便取得经验，加以推广。
