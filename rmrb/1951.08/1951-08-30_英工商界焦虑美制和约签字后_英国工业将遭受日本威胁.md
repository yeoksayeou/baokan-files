Xinhua News Agency, London, August 28th: Reuter reported from London on the 24th that the British important industrial and commercial newspaper, the "Financial Times," continued to express the anxiety of British industrialists and businessmen that the signing of the American draft peace treaty with Japan would seriously threaten certain British industries. The newspaper's recent issues have described the anxiety felt by the textile and pottery industries about the increasing Japanese competition. The "Financial Times" of August 21st also described the "threat" to the British shipbuilding industry. The "Financial Times" said somewhat angrily that Britain's proposal to impose some restrictions on Japan's shipbuilding capacity in the peace treaty with Japan had been "rejected" by the United States. The newspaper said that the United States is strongly funding the current Japanese shipbuilding program. The newspaper claimed that Japan's shipbuilding capacity is gradually increasing to 800,000 tons per year. Japan currently has 520,000 tons of ships under construction, which will account for 10% of the world's total new ships.

    英国工业将遭受日本威胁
    【新华社二十八日讯】电通社伦敦二十四日讯：英国重要的工商业报纸《金融时报》继续表示英国的工商业家忧虑美国对日和约草案的签字，将会严重地威胁英国某些工业。该报最近几期描写纺织业与陶器业对日益增加的日本竞争所感到的焦虑。八月二十一日的《金融时报》又描写了英国造船业所受到的“威胁”。《金融时报》有些愤怒地说：英国要求在对日和约中对日本造船能力加以若干限制的建议已被美国“拒绝”。该报说：美国是大力资助当前的日本造船计划的。该报称：日本的造船能力渐渐增至每年八十万吨。日本今天已有五十二万吨船只在建造中，它将占世界新造船只总数的百分之十。
