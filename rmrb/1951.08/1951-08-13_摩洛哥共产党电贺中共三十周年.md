Xinhua News Agency, 11th - The Secretariat of the Moroccan Communist Party sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, congratulating the Communist Party of China on its thirtieth anniversary.
    The telegram stated: "For the Moroccan communists and many patriots, Mao Zedong's party is a fighter struggling for the liberation of 475 million men and women who have lived in slavery, oppression and misery for many centuries.
    Today, your great people, under the leadership of your victorious party, have indeed driven the imperialists and their running dogs—the traitorous clique headed by Chiang Kai-shek—out of mainland China, and established a People's Republic where workers have jobs, farmers have land to till, children have books to read, and women have rights to enjoy.
    The people of Morocco are fighting French imperialism and domestic traitors, who are supported by U.S. imperialism. They will draw inspiration from the example of the great struggle of the Chinese Communist Party. They will restore national independence and thereby contribute to the defense of world peace."

　　摩洛哥共产党电贺中共三十周年
    【新华社十一日讯】摩洛哥共产党书记处致电中国共产党中央委员会，祝贺中国共产党成立三十周年。
    电文称：“对摩洛哥的共产党人和许多爱国分子来说，毛泽东的党是为好多世纪以来一直生活在奴役、压迫和苦难之下的四亿七千五百万男女求解放而斗争的战士。
    今天，你们的伟大人民在你们胜利的党的领导下，确实已把帝国主义者及其走狗——以蒋介石为首的卖国集团驱出了中国大陆，并且建立了工人有工可做、农民有田可耕、儿童有书可读、妇女有权利可享的人民共和国。
    摩洛哥的人民正在对受着美帝国主义支持的法帝国主义和国内卖国贼作战。他们将从中国共产党的伟大斗争的榜样中得到鼓舞。他们将恢复民族独立，从而对保卫世界和平有所贡献。”
