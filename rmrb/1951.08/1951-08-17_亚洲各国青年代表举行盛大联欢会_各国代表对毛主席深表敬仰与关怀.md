Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 15th. Seven hundred youth representatives from various Asian countries held a grand get-together here at the Electrical Equipment Factory Building on the afternoon of the 14th. The get-together was initiated by the Chinese delegation, with participation from youth representatives from Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaya, Burma, Siam, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Japan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan, and Israel. Feng Wenbin, head of the Chinese delegation, in his opening speech, paid tribute on behalf of Chinese youth to all peace-loving youth and people of the East. He said: "The gathering of young people from all parts of the East here today symbolizes the power of peace and the brotherly unity of the youth and people of the East. This force is a tremendous force for safeguarding peace in the East and throughout the world." Feng Wenbin then said: "Chinese youth, educated under Chairman Mao Zedong, are forever determined to defend peace at any cost. We assure all our young friends in the East that Chinese youth and the people support your struggle for national independence and a happy future, and we wish you greater success and victory." At this point, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause.

Kim Su-jin, head of the Korean delegation, then delivered a speech, expressing gratitude to the Chinese people and Chinese youth for their assistance to the Korean people, and thanking the youth of the East and the world for their brotherly solidarity. He said: The Korean people are confident of winning the final victory because our war is a just war, and with us are the Soviet Union, China, and the people of all countries in the world.

The Vietnamese youth representative, in his speech, emphasized the profound impact of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution on Vietnam and the entire Asia. He said: "The struggle waged by the Chinese youth under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao will forever be a good example for Vietnamese youth."

The Indian representative told the conference how they had overcome many difficulties to get here. He paid tribute to the Chinese youth, saying: "When India was hit by a severe famine, it was the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China that supplied us with food. While at this time, the parliaments of Western countries were engaged in endless debates, trying to exchange food for strategic materials and commit other atrocities. Indian youth and the people will always understand who their friends are and who their enemies are. Western imperialists are trying to prevent Indian youth from learning from Chinese youth, but Indian youth must strive to learn from the example of Chinese youth. The fighting path of the Chinese people inspires the Indian people like a beacon."

The speeches by the Indonesian and Japanese representatives both emphasized the need to strengthen solidarity and friendship with Chinese youth and the people. The Japanese youth representative also firmly stated: Japanese youth will never be cannon fodder for US imperialism's aggression against Korea and China.

The Iranian youth representative linked the Iranian people's struggle for the nationalization of oil with the victory of the Chinese people. He said: "We are continuing the struggle, and this struggle has won the support and solidarity of the Chinese people and the people of the world. We are convinced that the unity of peace-loving people all over the world will destroy the foundations of imperialism. Imperialism's rule in Asia is doomed to perish." The speeches by the Syrian and Lebanese youth representatives pointed out that the Chinese people are one of the leading forces in defending peace.

The attending representatives unanimously expressed their deep love and admiration for Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao's name and the name of Marshal Stalin were repeatedly cheered by all the Eastern youth. The conference proceeded for five hours in an extremely friendly and warm atmosphere. During the breaks, youth representatives from various countries exchanged gifts, and youth performing arts troupes from China and Korea performed brilliant artistic programs.

    各国代表对毛主席深表敬仰与关怀
    【新华社柏林十五日电】来自亚洲各国家的七百名青年代表，于十四日下午在此间电工器材厂大厦中举行一次盛大的联欢会。联欢会由中国代表团发起，参加的有朝鲜、越南、柬埔寨、印尼、马来亚、缅甸、暹罗、印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰、日本、伊朗、伊拉克、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、外约但、以色列等国的青年代表。中国代表团团长冯文彬在开会词中代表中国青年向东方的一切爱好和平的青年和人民致敬。他说：“来自东方各地的青年们今天在这里聚会，这象征着和平与东方青年和人民的兄弟般的团结的力量。这个力量是保卫东方和全世界的和平的一个巨大力量。”冯文彬接着说：“在毛泽东主席教育下的中国青年，永远决心不惜任何牺牲来保卫和平。我们向东方的一切青年朋友们保证，中国青年和人民支持你们争取民族独立和幸福将来的斗争，并祝你们获得更大的成功和胜利。”这时，全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
