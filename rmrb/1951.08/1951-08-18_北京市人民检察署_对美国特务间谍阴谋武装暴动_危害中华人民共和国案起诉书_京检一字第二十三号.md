The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, in September 1950, discovered that Antonio Riva, Ryuichi Yamaguchi and others, acting as special agents and spies for the U.S. government, were engaged in serious crimes of conspiring to stage an armed rebellion. On September 26 of the same year, the bureau arrested Antonio Riva, Ryuichi Yamaguchi, and others, seizing a large number of criminal evidence such as military weapons and intelligence; and continued the investigation. In May 1951, the bureau cracked the entire case and seized another batch of evidence. On August 2, the bureau transferred the arrested defendants and the seized criminal evidence to this Procuratorate. After investigation by this Procuratorate, it was confirmed that all the defendants, Antonio Riva, Ryuichi Yamaguchi, Tarcisio Martina, Henri Vetch, Quirino Victor Lucy Gerli, Walter Genthner, Ma Xinqing and other seven persons, under the command of the U.S. Office of Strategic Service, the U.S. Occupation Forces Headquarters in Tokyo, and the former U.S. Embassy in China's Beijing Military Attaché Office, committed major crimes of conspiring to stage armed rebellion, hiding military weapons, and spying on our national secrets, endangering the People's Republic of China, with conclusive evidence.

The defendants listed on the right, before and after the liberation of Beijing, were successively instructed by the Japanese invading army, the Italian fascist government, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the U.S. government's spy agencies, the U.S. Office of Strategic Service, the Japanese Tokyo U.S. Occupation Forces Headquarters, and Colonel David Dean Barrett, the military attaché of the former U.S. Embassy in China's Beijing Military Attaché Office, to sabotage our people's War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, and continuously carried out conspiracies of sabotage and espionage activities against the People's Liberation Areas and the People's Republic of China. After the liberation of Beijing, the defendants Antonio Riva, Ryuichi Yamaguchi and others, under the command of the aforementioned U.S. government spy agencies and their agents, not only continued to carry out lurking activities, spying on our military, political, and economic secrets, but also conspired to stage armed rebellion and hide military weapons. The defendants Antonio Riva, Ryuichi Yamaguchi and others attempted to shell the Tiananmen reviewing stand during our National Day celebration on October 1, 1950, and assassinate our state leaders and other leaders of the Central People's Government who participated in the National Day celebration. The main facts of the crimes committed by each of the defendants are listed as follows:

Defendant Antonio Riva was an Italian fascist bandit who opened the Asiatic Import and Export Co. in Tianjin in 1923. He sold military weapons such as airplanes and artillery to the Northern Warlords Cao Kun and Qi Xieyuan to carry out civil wars that harmed the Chinese people. In 1926, he organized the Beijing branch of the Fascist Party in Beijing and served as the branch chief. In 1934, Mussolini, the Italian fascist bandit leader, dispatched the "Italian Air Force Guidance Group" to China. Antonio Riva served as the secretary-general of the group, helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang build airfields and establish air force schools in Nanchang and Luoyang, train air force personnel, and purchase a large number of aircraft from Italy to attack the Chinese people's revolutionary bases.

In 1937, when the Japanese invaders occupied North China, Antonio Riva colluded with Hidaka Tomiaki, a senior special agent of the "North China Area Army Headquarters Press Department" of the Japanese invaders, and traveled to various parts of North China to carry out special agent espionage activities, collecting intelligence for the Japanese invading army. Shortly after Japan surrendered in 1945, Antonio Riva established an espionage relationship with Colonel David Dean Barrett, the military attaché of the former U.S. Embassy in China's Beijing Military Attaché Office. According to Antonio Riva's confession:

"The intelligence I gave to Colonel Barrett, both oral and written, included approximately four hundred items related to military, political, and economic matters, with particular emphasis on the activities of the Soviet Union and its personnel in China. It can be roughly divided into two parts:

1.  Before liberation, approximately one-third of the total intelligence was about the events of the civil war and the activities of Soviet personnel in China.

2.  After the liberation of Beijing, it was mainly about the politics and economy of the People's Government." (Antonio Riva's written confession of June 2, 1951)

Under the command of the U.S. government's spy agency, Antonio Riva recruited Ryuichi Yamaguchi, a Japanese special agent, to serve as his intelligence agent in March 1948, and directed Tarcisio Martina, Henri Vetch, Quirino Victor Lucy Gerli, Walter Genthner, Ma Xinqing and others who served as spies for the U.S. government, to collect military, political, and economic intelligence from our liberated areas. From March 1948 to before the liberation of Beijing, Antonio Riva handed over 115 pieces of intelligence he collected to Barrett. Barrett wrote a letter to Antonio Riva on January 29, 1949, praising his achievements in carrying out espionage activities, stating in the letter: "The materials you sent are very valuable, and I am very happy to receive them."

After the liberation of Beijing, Antonio Riva continued to carry out espionage activities under the guise of being the Beijing agent of James Walter and Sons Co. Antonio Riva instructed Ryuichi Yamaguchi and others to collect the resumes, characteristics, addresses, telephone and car numbers of the leaders of the Central People's Government, representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and responsible persons of the Communist Party of China and various democratic parties and people's organizations, and made cards as preparation for carrying out sabotage activities; and collected relevant military, political, and economic intelligence about our country. From the liberation of Beijing to the time Antonio Riva was arrested, Antonio Riva, Ryuichi Yamaguchi and others collected 485 pieces of intelligence and handed them over to Barrett and other U.S. government spy agencies.

Before the liberation of Beijing, Antonio Riva hid a mortar, pistols, grenades, ammunition, etc., in his own home and in Martina's home, preparing to carry out armed rebellion after liberation. In 1950, Antonio Riva and Ryuichi Yamaguchi conspired to shell the Tiananmen reviewing stand during our National Day celebration on October 1, 1950, and assassinate our state leaders and various leaders of the Central People's Government who participated in the National Day celebration. Antonio Riva made the following confession regarding this criminal conspiracy:

"Q: What weapons and ammunition do you have?

A: I have one Stokes mortar, six or eight grenades, one pistol, and mortar shells, and hundreds of bullets.

Q: Did you register these weapons and ammunition after liberation?

A: I did not report to the Public Security Bureau after liberation, nor did I register them.

Q: Where did you hide these weapons?

A: In my house at No. 17, Gan Yu Hutong, I hid one pistol, one mortar, which has been disassembled. In Martina's house at No. 6, Nai Zi Fu, I hid shells, grenades, bullets, etc.

Q: What did you use them for?

A: I planned to use them when I had the opportunity in the future, or lend them to others.

Q: What opportunity would you use it for?

A: I once told Ryuichi Yamaguchi that I said: I could try it at Tiananmen.

Q: How did you say it?

A: This was in 1950, I can't remember the date, at my house, when we were chatting, I said: "Wait until the Chinese government holds a meeting in Tiananmen, and try it." Yamaguchi said: "This is dangerous behavior." I said: "You can take risks; only risks have a price, I don't think this is a serious matter." I now fully confess to this behavior, please forgive me." (Antonio Riva's confession of July 27, 1951)

The armed rebellion conspiracy of Antonio Riva and others was detected by our Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau before it was implemented, and Antonio Riva and others were arrested on September 26, 1950. In Antonio Riva's residence, one 60mm mortar, one pistol, 235 pistol and rifle bullets, and special agent credentials issued to Antonio Riva by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, intelligence supplied by Antonio Riva to Barrett, and correspondence between Antonio Riva, Barrett, Ryuichi Yamaguchi and others related to espionage activities, totaling 528 items, were seized.

Defendant Ryuichi Yamaguchi came to China in 1938 during the Japanese invasion of China and served as the deputy director and director of the "Beijing Office of the North China Shipping General Trade Union", collecting military intelligence of the Chinese people's anti-Japanese guerrillas in the coastal areas of North China and supplying it to the Japanese Ministry of the Navy.

In January 1946, Ryuichi Yamaguchi joined the U.S. Office of Strategic Services in Beijing, serving as a spy for the U.S. government, and joined the Kuomintang International Intelligence Agency in March of the same year. Ryuichi Yamaguchi collected intelligence on the Communist Party of China and the liberated areas through various relationships and supplied it to the U.S. Office of Strategic Services.

In March 1948, Ryuichi Yamaguchi established an espionage relationship with Antonio Riva, who served as a spy for the U.S. government. In addition to continuing to supply intelligence to the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, he also supplied the same intelligence to Antonio Riva. The main content of the intelligence was the military, political, and economic situation of the liberated areas.

In November 1948, when Beijing was about to be liberated, the U.S. government's spy agency ordered Ryuichi Yamaguchi to carry out lurking activities and gave him activity funds. Ryuichi Yamaguchi continued to collect intelligence under the guise of being the "Chinese Section Book Catalog Editor" of the French Library opened by Henri Vetch.

In the autumn of 1949, Ryuichi Yamaguchi established an espionage relationship with Colonel Barrett, the military attaché of the former U.S. Embassy in China's Beijing Military Attaché Office, through Antonio Riva. The number of intelligence supplied each month reached a maximum of fifty items. According to Ryuichi Yamaguchi's confession, Barrett attached great importance to his espionage activities and increased his monthly salary to $150.

According to the letters seized from Ryuichi Yamaguchi's residence, it is proven that Ryuichi Yamaguchi intended to shell Tiananmen on the National Day of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1950. Ryuichi Yamaguchi reported this conspiracy to the U.S. Occupation Forces Headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, in January 1950. Between May and July of the same year, Ryuichi Yamaguchi personally measured the terrain around Tiananmen Square and drew a map of the Tiananmen situation and the aiming points for shooting at the reviewing stand, noting in detail the situation of Tiananmen Square, stating that our Central People's Government leaders would inspect the masses' ranks at Tiananmen on important festivals. This situation map and explanation were sent to the U.S. Occupation Forces Headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, on September 16, 1950. On September 26, Ryuichi Yamaguchi wrote a letter to the U.S. Occupation Forces Headquarters in Tokyo, estimating the possibility of realizing the conspiracy plan to shell Tiananmen and determining the measures to be taken. Regarding the criminal plan to shell Tiananmen, Ryuichi Yamaguchi confessed:

"I knew that when there was a gathering, the government leaders would all come to Tiananmen. On October 1, China's National Day, I thought there must be a meeting here. I drew this Tiananmen for the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo to tell them that the target was Mao Zedong's position at Tiananmen." In the same confession, he admitted:

"I have a hostile ideology towards the Soviet Communist Party, and I am equally hostile to the Chinese Communist Party. I knew about Antonio Riva's mortar, and I wanted to do a risky shooting." (Ryuichi Yamaguchi's confession of July 27, 1951)

Our Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau detected the criminal conspiracy of Ryuichi Yamaguchi and Antonio Riva in advance and arrested the defendants on September 26, 1950. From Ryuichi Yamaguchi's home, 12 items such as the appointment order issued by the Puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, 48 intelligence drafts, 210 cards with the names of the leaders of the Central People's Government and representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, 1,093 pieces of intelligence materials, espionage documents, and correspondence with Antonio Riva related to espionage activities, and a draft of Ryuichi Yamaguchi's Tiananmen shooting map were seized.

Defendant Tarcisio Martina is an imperialist element hidden in Catholicism who has consistently engaged in espionage activities under the guise of preaching and sabotaged the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. During the Japanese invasion of China, Tarcisio Martina helped the "Maintenance Society" organized by Chinese traitors in Yixian, used priests to frequently spy on the military intelligence of the Eighth Route Army, supplied it to the Japanese invading army, and welcomed the Japanese army to station in the Catholic Church.

After the Japanese invaders surrendered, Tarcisio Martina colluded with Qiu Xingxiang, the commander of the Kuomintang bandit army in Yixian, to jointly organize armed plainclothes teams. According to Tarcisio Martina's confession:

"On April 15th and 16th, 1947, Commander Qiu asked me to help organize a plainclothes team for the first time. I said it would be easy. Two days later, Commander Qiu invited me to dinner, along with the county magistrate, section chief, two regimental commanders, the secretary of the political department, the plainclothes team leader, and the police chief. We discussed organizing a plainclothes team and asked me to find people inside and outside the city. Two or three days later, I told Father Bai (Marco Blasutig, Italian) about this matter in my room. I said to Bai: We can help find people, go outside the city to find people who oppose the Eighth Route Army, both inside and outside the church. When the plainclothes team began to sign up, the registration office was set up in the Catholic Church. Twenty days later, Father Bai reported to me: There are now more than twenty people. ... He also reported to me that in a small village five or six miles outside the east of Yixian, the plainclothes team pretended to be the Eighth Route Army and arrested several Eighth Route Army cadres. The plainclothes team and the "county government" and other departments contacted, and Father Bai was fully responsible. The plainclothes team reported the situation to the political department every day, doing military intelligence: where is the Eighth Route Army now." (Tarcisio Martina's confession of May 19, 1951)

In addition, Tarcisio Martina sent Catholic priests out to collect intelligence. He himself confessed: "The priests in Yixian went to various villages to preach. Originally, they were scheduled to go out every Sunday, but later they could not go out on the scheduled day. Whenever they had the opportunity to go out, they collected news about the Eighth Route Army and came back to tell me." (Confession of Tarcisio Martina on May 19, 1951)

In June 1947, before the liberation of Yixian, Tarcisio Martina was dispatched by Qiu Xingxiang, the commander of the Kuomintang bandit army, to provide military vehicles and armed forces to protect him to escape to Beijing. In November of the same year, through the introduction of Antonio Riva, who served as a special agent and spy for the U.S. government, Tarcisio Martina established an espionage relationship with Colonel Barrett, the military attaché of the former U.S. Embassy in China's Beijing Military Attaché Office, and was commanded by Antonio Riva.

Tarcisio Martina had known Antonio Riva, a fascist, before World War II. Since 1947, the main facts of Tarcisio Martina's participation in Antonio Riva's conspiracy activities are: 1. Hiding military weapons for Antonio Riva to use for armed rebellion; 2. Frequently providing Antonio Riva with intelligence on the military, political, and economic aspects of the liberated areas. According to his confession, for oral intelligence alone, it was "two to three times a month before March 1948, and once a month thereafter (Confession of Tarcisio Martina on May 19, 1951)." The written intelligence he provided to Antonio Riva, according to Antonio Riva's confession on May 19, 1951, included "economic conditions in the Changxindian area and its surrounding areas" and "supplementary intelligence on the Juma River Hydropower Project", totaling more than 40 items. Antonio Riva also confessed that he had "handed over this intelligence to Barrett."

After June 1947, Tarcisio Martina served as the "Beijing Representative" of Riberi, the former "Papal Nuncio to China", whose main task was to collect intelligence for Riberi. According to Tarcisio Martina's confession: "In June 1947, I reported to Riberi in Nai Zi Fu that there were Eighth Route Army in Yixian and Laishui County." Later, he provided Riberi with more than 10 items of written intelligence on "Siping Street Battle", "Fushun, Chahar, Xuanhua, Jiamusi" and other places.

After Tarcisio Martina's criminal activities were confirmed by Antonio Riva, who served as a spy for the U.S. government, our Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested the defendant Tarcisio Martina at No. 6, Nai Zi Fu, on May 12, 1951. Mortar shells, rifle bullets, pistol bullets, etc. totaling 259 rounds, 8 grenades, 273 mortar shell warheads and primers, weapon parts, etc., hidden by Tarcisio Martina for Antonio Riva, who served as a special agent and spy for the U.S. government, and 6 drafts of intelligence he collected for Antonio Riva and Riberi on our army's liberation of "Siping Street Battle" and other places were seized.

Defendant Henri Vetch served as an artillery officer in the French army during World War I. In 1939, he went to Langson, Vietnam, to serve as an artillery officer in the French colonial army. In 1941, he returned to Beijing and succeeded his father as the manager of the French Library. Since 1943, Henri Vetch has been friends with Ryuichi Yamaguchi, a Japanese special agent, and in 1948, he harbored Ryuichi Yamaguchi to work as an editor for the French Library. According to Vetch's confession:

"I knew that Ryuichi Yamaguchi was a spy, collecting intelligence for the Kuomintang. I knew that he was working in a Kuomintang intelligence agency. Before and after liberation, I introduced Yamaguchi to rent a house near Antonio Riva's house. I introduced Yamaguchi to Antonio Riva. Ryuichi Yamaguchi taught me Japanese since 1946, and came to my bookstore in 1948 to compile Chinese catalogs. After I met him, he told me that he was working in the Kuomintang intelligence agency, and I knew that he was a spy. I knew that he came to my bookstore to collect intelligence." (Henri Vetch's confession of August 1, 1951)

According to Ryuichi Yamaguchi's confession on September 29, 1950, when Ryuichi Yamaguchi was collecting intelligence materials for the Kuomintang Military Intelligence Bureau, Henri Vetch provided him with intelligence.

Henri Vetch also had an espionage relationship with Antonio Riva, who served as a spy for the U.S. government, and Colonel Barrett, the military attaché of the former U.S. Embassy in China's Beijing Military Attaché Office. According to Antonio Riva's confession: "After liberation, he (Henri Vetch) provided me with intelligence on various aspects such as politics, economy, and culture on many occasions." After Barrett withdrew from China in April 1950, Henri Vetch continued to collect intelligence materials on various aspects of our country and sent them to Hong Kong for transfer to Barrett. Barrett wrote to Henri Vetch on August 9, 1950, urging him to endure all kinds of difficulties and maintain the French Library as a cover and fulcrum for activities.

Defendant Quirino Victor Lucy Gerli came to China in 1921. Since 1943, he has been doing espionage work for the Japanese invading army. After Japan surrendered, Gerli established an espionage relationship with Colonel Barrett, the military attaché of the former U.S. Embassy in China's Beijing Military Attaché Office. After the liberation of Beijing, Barrett and others left Beijing, and Gerli still supplied Barrett with intelligence on our country's politics, economy, and diplomacy collected in Beijing by means of communication.

Defendant Walter Genthner was a German Nazi Party member who met Antonio Riva, who served as a spy for the U.S. government, in 1940. In 1945, when the U.S. military came to Beijing, Genthner served as a U.S. military spy. In April 1949, he worked as an engineer at the former U.S. Consulate in Beijing. At the same time, he collected intelligence for Antonio Riva, who served as a spy for the U.S. government. In June 1950, he went to the Changxindian Railway Factory and the Tongxian State-owned Farm and other places to spy on intelligence and supply it to Antonio Riva and Colonel Barrett, the military attaché of the former U.S. Embassy in China's Beijing Military Attaché Office.

Defendant Ma Xinqing colluded with Gerli, who served as a spy for the U.S. government, and supplied Gerli with intelligence on our country's military, political, economic, and diplomatic affairs for transmission to the U.S. government's spy agency.

In summary, the above facts fully prove that the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, the U.S. Occupation Forces Headquarters in Tokyo, and the former U.S. Embassy in China's Beijing Military Attaché Office are the organizers and commanders of all the criminal facts in this case. U.S. imperialism is the enemy of the Chinese people and the Chinese people's democratic cause. After the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, they still "engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will try to restore the old order in China every day and every hour." The defendants in this case are all special agents and spies directly commanded by the U.S. government. The defendants Antonio Riva, Ryuichi Yamaguchi, Tarcisio Martina, Henri Vetch, Quirino Victor Lucy Gerli, Walter Genthner, Ma Xinqing and others, under the command of the aforementioned U.S. government spy agencies, conspired to stage armed rebellion, hid military weapons, attempted to endanger the head of state of our People's Republic of China, spied on our military and political secrets, and sabotaged our people's democratic cause. Their crimes are extremely heinous. Because the evidence is conclusive and the case is as solid as a mountain, the defendants have all confessed to the aforementioned crimes during the inspection period of this Procuratorate. This kind of conspiracy of armed rebellion and espionage is a clear violation of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries. Therefore, this Procurator General files a public prosecution against the defendants Antonio Riva, Ryuichi Yamaguchi, Tarcisio Martina, Henri Vetch, Quirino Victor Lucy Gerli, Walter Genthner, Ma Xinqing and others, and requests your department to try them according to law.

Respectfully addressed to

    右列各被告在北京解放前后，先后分别受日本侵略军、意大利法西斯政府、蒋介石匪帮、美国政府的间谍机关美国战略情报局、日本东京美国占领军总部和前美国驻华大使馆驻北平武官处上校武官包瑞德（Ｃolonel Ｄevid ＤeanＢarrett）指使，破坏我国人民抗日战争、人民解放战争，对人民解放区和中华人民共和国，不断地进行阴谋破坏与间谍活动。在北京解放以后，被告李安东、山口隆一等在上述美国政府间谍机关及其代理人的指使之下，不仅继续进行潜伏活动，刺探我国军事、政治、经济机密，并阴谋武装暴动，隐藏军火武器。被告李安东、山口隆一等妄图于一九五○年十月一日我国国庆大典时，炮击天安门检阅台，谋杀我国国家元首和中央人民政府其他首长。兹将各该被告犯罪的主要事实列述如下：
    被告李安东  是意大利法西斯匪徒，一九二三年在天津开设意亚公司（ＴheＡsiatic Ｉmport and Ｅxport Ｃo.），曾以飞机、大炮等军火，售与北洋军阀曹锟、齐燮元进行残害中国人民的内战。一九二六年在北京组织法西斯党北京支部，自任支部长。一九三四年意大利法西斯匪首墨索里尼派遣“意国空军指导团”来中国，李安东任该团秘书长，帮助蒋介石匪帮在南昌、洛阳修筑飞机场，建立空军学校，训练空军人员，从意大利购买大批飞机，以进攻中国人民革命根据地。
    一九三七年，日寇侵占华北，李安东与日寇“北支那方面军司令部报道部”高级特务日高富明相勾结，往来华北各地，进行特务间谍活动，为日本侵略军搜集情报。一九四五年日本投降后不久，李安东即与前美国驻华大使馆驻北平武官处上校武官包瑞德发生间谍关系。据李安东供认：
    “我给包瑞德上校口头和书面的情报，包括大约四百件有关军事、政治和经济方面的，特别着重苏联及其在中国的人员的活动。大致可分为两部分：
    一、解放前，大约占总数三分之一的情报是关于内战的事件，以及苏联人员在中国的活动。
    二、北京解放以后，主要是关于人民政府政治和经济的。”（一九五一年六月二日李安东的笔供）
    李安东在美国政府间谍机关的指挥下，于一九四八年三月，收罗日本特务山口隆一充当他的情报员，并指挥充当美国政府间谍的马迪懦、魏智、哲立、甘斯纳、马新清等，搜集我解放区军事、政治、经济情报。自一九四八年三月到北京解放前，李安东将他所搜集的一百一十五份情报，交给包瑞德。包瑞德在一九四九年一月二十九日写信给李安东，赞扬他进行间谍活动的成绩，信上说：“给我送来的材料，很有价值，我很高兴能得到它。”
    北京解放以后，李安东以天津老世昌公司（Ｊames Ｗalter and Ｓons Ｃo.）北京代理人的身份为掩护，继续进行间谍活动。李安东指使山口隆一等搜集中央人民政府首长、中国人民政治协商会议代表、中国共产党和各民主党派、人民团体负责人的履历、特征、住址、电话和汽车号码，制成卡片，作为进行破坏活动的准备；并搜集有关我国的军事、政治、经济情报。从北京解放到李安东就捕时为止，李安东和山口隆一等搜集情报达四百八十五件，送交包瑞德和其他美国政府间谍机关。
    李安东在北京解放前，即将迫击炮一门、手枪、手榴弹和弹药等，分别隐藏在他自己和马迪懦家中，准备在解放后进行武装暴动。一九五○年，李安东和山口隆一合谋，妄图于一九五○年十月一日我国国庆节大会时，炮击天安门检阅台，一举谋杀我参加国庆大典的国家元首和中央人民政府各首长。李安东对于这个罪恶阴谋，曾作如下之供认：
    “问：你有那些武器弹药？
    答：我有Ｓtokes式迫击炮一门，手榴弹六或八个，手枪一支，还有迫击炮弹，还有几百粒子弹。
    问：这些武器弹药，解放后你登记了吗？
    答：解放后没有向公安局报告，也没有登记。
    问：这些武器你隐藏在何处？
    答：在甘雨胡同乙十七号我家里，藏有手枪一支，迫击炮一门，已拆卸。在乃兹府甲六号马迪懦家，藏有炮弹、手榴弹、子弹等。
    问：你做什么用？
    答：我计划将来有机会使用，或者借给别人使用。
    问：遇到什么机会使用它？
    答：我曾经与山口隆一说过，我说过：可以在天安门地方试一试。
    问：你怎样说的？
    答：这是在一九五○年，日期记不清了，在我家，我俩闲谈时，我说：“等中国政府在天安门开会时试一试。”山口说：“这是危险行为。”我说：“可以冒险；只有冒险才有代价，我以为这不是什么严重的事。”这种行为，现在我完全认罪，请原谅。”（一九五一年七月二十七日李安东口供）
    李安东等的武装暴动阴谋，在实施以前，我北京市人民政府公安局即已侦悉，并于一九五○年九月二十六日将李安东等加以逮捕，并在李安东的住所中搜出阴谋武装暴动所用的六零迫击炮一门，手枪一枝，手枪和步枪子弹二百三十五发，及日寇和蒋介石匪帮发给李安东的特务证件、李安东供给包瑞德的情报、李安东和包瑞德、山口隆一等有关间谍活动的来往函电等共五百二十八件。
    被告山口隆一  于一九三八年日本侵华期间到中国，充任伪“华北航业总工会北京办事处”副处长、处长等职务，搜集华北沿海地区中国人民抗日游击队的军事情报，供给日本海军省。
    一九四六年一月，山口隆一在北京参加美国战略情报局充当美国政府间谍，并于同年三月参加国民党国际情报机关。山口隆一通过各种关系，搜集中国共产党和解放区的情报，供给美国战略情报局。
    一九四八年三月，山口隆一与充当美国政府间谍的李安东发生间谍关系，除继续以情报供给美国战略情报局之外，同时以相同的情报，供给李安东。情报的主要内容，是解放区的军事、政治、经济情况。
    一九四八年十一月，北京即将解放时，美国政府间谍机关命山口隆一潜伏活动，并发给他活动经费。山口隆一以魏智所开设的法文图书馆“中文部图书目录编辑”的名义为掩护，继续搜集情报。
    一九四九年秋，山口隆一经过李安东与前美国驻华大使馆驻北平武官处武官包瑞德建立间谍关系。每月供给的情报数量，最多时达五十份。据山口隆一自供，包瑞德对他的间谍活动极为重视，并将其月薪增至一百五十美元。
    根据在山口隆一住所查获的信件，证明山口隆一于一九五○年一月，即蓄意在同年十月一日中华人民共和国国庆节炮击天安门。山口隆一于一九五○年一月将此项阴谋报告日本东京美国占领军总部。在同年五月到七月间，山口隆一亲自测量天安门广场周围的地形，绘成天安门形势图和向检阅台射击的指标，详细注明天安门广场的情况，说明我中央人民政府首长每逢重要节日，即临天安门检阅群众队伍。此项形势图和说明，于一九五○年九月十六日发往日本东京美国占领军总部。九月二十六日，山口隆一又写信给东京美国占领军总部，对炮击天安门的阴谋计划实现的可能性，作了估计，并确定采取的办法。对炮击天安门的罪恶计划，山口隆一供认：
    “我知道集会时，政府要人都到天安门来，十月一日中国的国庆日，我想一定在这开会，我给东京盟军总部画这个天安门，是告诉他们，天安门毛泽东位置的目标。”在同一口供中，他承认：
    “我有仇视苏联共产党的思想，对中国共产党也同样的敌对。我知道李安东的迫击炮，我想做冒险的射击。”（一九五一年七月二十七日山口隆一口供）
    我北京市人民政府公安局在事前即侦悉山口隆一和李安东的罪恶阴谋，在一九五○年九月二十六日，将该被告等同时捕获，并从山口隆一的家中查获伪华北政务委员会委派令等十二件，情报底稿四十八件，中央人民政府首长和中国人民政治协商会议代表等卡片二百一十份，情报材料、间谍证件和与李安东有关间谍活动的来往信件等计一千零九十三件，山口隆一测绘的射击天安门图稿一幅。
    被告马迪懦  是掩藏在天主教中的帝国主义分子，以传教为掩护，一贯进行间谍活动，破坏中国人民的抗日战争和解放战争。马迪懦在日本侵略中国期间，曾帮助易县的汉奸组织“维持会”，利用神甫经常刺探八路军的军事情报，供给日本侵略军，并迎接日军在天主教堂驻扎。
    日寇投降后，马迪懦在易县勾结国民党匪军师长邱行湘，共同组织武装便衣队。据马迪懦自供：
    “一九四七年四月十五、六日，邱师长第一次托我帮忙组织便衣队。我说这事好办。过两天，邱师长请我吃饭，还有县长、科长、两个团长、政治部秘书、便衣队长、警察局长，大家研究组织便衣队，叫我负责在城内外找人。两、三天以后，在我的房里，我将此事对白神甫（白克礼Ｍarco Ｂlasutig，意大利人）说了。我对白说：我们可以帮忙找，到城外去找，要反对八路军的，教内教外的都可以。便衣队开始报名时，报名处设在天主堂内。过了二十天，白神甫向我报告：现在已经有二十多人了。……他还向我报告过在易县东边城外五、六里地一个小村里，便衣队假装八路军，抓了几个八路军的干部。便衣队和“县政府”等处联络，完全由白神甫负责。便衣队每天将情况报告政治部，做军事情报：八路军现在哪里。”（一九五一年五月十九日马迪懦口供）
    此外，马迪懦并派遣天主教神甫出外搜集情报，他自己供称：“易县神甫到各村传教，原来定每星期日出外，后来不能按规定日子出去，随时有机会出去，搜集有关八路军的消息，回来跟我说。”（一九五一年五月十九日口供）
    一九四七年六月，易县解放前，马迪懦由国民党匪军师长邱行湘，派遣军用汽车和武装部队，保护他逃到北京。同年十一月经过充当美国政府特务间谍的李安东的介绍，马迪懦与前美国驻华大使馆驻北平武官处上校武官包瑞德发生间谍关系，受李安东指挥。
    马迪懦在第二次世界大战前，即与法西斯党徒李安东相识。从一九四七年起，马迪懦参与李安东的阴谋活动的主要事实是：一、为李安东隐藏准备作武装暴动之用的军火武器；二、经常向李安东供给有关解放区军事、政治、经济各方面的情报。据其自供，仅口头情报一项，在“一九四八年三月以前每月两次到三次，以后每月一次（一九五一年五月十九日口供）。”他供给李安东的书面情报，据李安东在一九五一年五月十九日供认：有“关于长辛店地区及其周边地带的经济情况”、“拒马河水力发电工程补充情报”等共四十多件。李安东并供认已“将此项情报送交包瑞德”。
    马迪懦在一九四七年六月以后，充任前“罗马教廷驻华公使”黎培里的“北京代表”，其主要任务是为黎培里搜集情报，据马迪懦自供：“一九四七年六月，在乃兹府曾向黎培里报告了易县、涞水县什么地方有八路军”。其后，又以书面的“四平街战役”、“抚顺、察哈尔、宣化、佳木斯”等地情报十多件，供给黎培里。
    马迪懦的犯罪活动，经充当美国政府间谍的李安东证实以后，我北京市人民政府公安局于一九五一年五月十二日在乃兹府甲六号将被告马迪懦予以逮捕，并曾查获马迪懦为充当美国政府特务间谍的李安东隐藏的迫击炮弹、步枪子弹、手枪子弹等二百五十九发，手榴弹八枚，迫击炮弹弹头和底火、兵器零件等二百七十三件以及他为李安东、黎培里搜集的有关我军解放“四平街战役”等情报底稿六件。
    被告魏智  在第一次世界大战期间，曾在法国陆军任炮兵军官，一九三九年到越南谅山（Ｌangson），任法国殖民地陆军炮兵军官，于一九四一年重来北京，即继其父为法文图书馆经理。从一九四三年起，魏智与日本特务山口隆一结交，一九四八年窝藏山口隆一充法文图书馆编辑。据魏智供称：
    “我知道山口隆一是个间谍，为国民党搜集情报。我知道他是在国民党一个特务机关工作的。解放前后，我为山口介绍租房子，住在李安东的附近。我为山口介绍李安东。山口隆一从一九四六年起教我日文，一九四八年起到我书店编写中文书目。我认识了他之后，他就告诉我，他是在国民党特务机关工作，我就知道他是一个间谍，我知道他到我书店里来，是为搜集情报。”（一九五一年八月一日魏智的口供）
    据山口隆一在一九五○年九月二十九日供词中所述，当山口隆一为国民党军统特务搜集情报材料时，魏智曾以情报供给他。
    魏智同时亦与充当美国政府间谍的李安东及前美国驻华大使馆驻北平武官处上校武官包瑞德发生间谍关系。据李安东供称：“解放后，他（魏智）曾多次供给我以政治、经济、文化等各方面的情报。”包瑞德于一九五○年四月撤离中国以后，魏智继续搜集我国各方面的情报材料，寄往香港转交包瑞德。包瑞德在一九五○年八月九日函告魏智，切望他忍受各种困难，保持法文图书馆，作为活动之掩护与支点。
    被告哲立  一九二一年来中国。一九四三年起，为日本侵略军作谍报工作。日本投降后，哲立与前美国驻华大使馆驻北平武官处上校武官包瑞德发生间谍关系。北京解放后，包瑞德等离京，哲立仍以通信方式将其在京所搜集的有关我国政治、经济、外交等情报供给包瑞德。
    被告甘斯纳  是德国纳粹党徒，一九四○年和充当美国政府间谍的李安东相识。一九四五年美军来北京，甘斯纳曾充任美军间谍，于一九四九年四月，在前美国驻北平领事馆当工程师，同时为充当美国政府间谍的李安东搜集情报，于一九五○年六月间，曾到长辛店铁路工厂及通县国营农场等地，刺探情报，供给李安东和前美国驻华大使馆驻北平武官处上校武官包瑞德。
    被告马新清  与充当美国政府间谍的哲立勾结，将有关我国军事、政治、经济、外交情报，供给哲立，转报美国政府间谍机关。
    综合上述事实，充分证明美国战略情报局、东京美国占领军总部、前美国驻华大使馆驻北平武官处是本案一切犯罪事实的组织者与指挥者，美帝国主义是中国人民和中国人民民主事业的敌人，他们在中国人民革命胜利以后，仍然“以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”本案的各被告都是美国政府直接指挥的特务间谍。被告李安东、山口隆一、马迪懦、魏智、哲立、甘斯纳、马新清等在上述美国政府间谍机关的指挥之下，阴谋武装暴动，隐藏军火武器，妄图危害我中华人民共和国元首，刺探我国军政机密，破坏我人民民主事业，实属罪大恶极，由于证据确凿，铁案如山，被告等在本署检察期间，对前述罪行，均已分别供认。此种阴谋武装暴动和间谍的罪行，显然触犯我中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例，因此本检察长对被告李安东、山口隆一、马迪懦、魏智、哲立、甘斯纳、马新清等提起公诉，请贵处依法审判。
