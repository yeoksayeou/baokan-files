　　Oppose Wasting Timber, Oppose Indiscriminate Logging!
    Central South Should Thoroughly Stop Indiscriminate Logging and Panic Buying of Timber
    Since last year, indiscriminate logging and panic buying of timber have occurred in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces and parts of Guangxi in the Central South region. After the provinces implemented the policy of unified timber harvesting and adopted measures to manage the market in April and May of this year, the situation has improved; however, disguised monopoly control, forced purchase at low prices, and indiscriminate logging have not been completely stopped. The local leading organs should immediately correct this phenomenon of only considering local interests and neglecting national production and construction, based on the State Council's instructions on saving timber.
  Logging Has Greatly Exceeded the Normal Logging Volume
    It is understood that the timber logged in the Central South region this year has far exceeded the region's harvesting plan for this year. Last year, the timber harvested in the region also exceeded the normal harvesting volume by more than 40%. The current timber reserves in Jiangxi account for about 40% of the region's harvesting plan for this year; plus the timber, sawn timber, and square boards that have already been shipped out, this amounts to about 60% of the region's harvesting plan for this year. Particularly serious is the Jiangxi Timber Company's plan to harvest Chinese fir, which exceeds the province's annual production of Chinese fir by 30% to 160%. The timber harvested in Hunan Province from 1949 to 1950 was approximately 1 million to 1.2 million cubic meters, which is one to two times the normal harvesting volume.
    The main reason for this indiscriminate logging phenomenon is the localism and departmentalism of some local government organs and individual troops who want to "subsidize finances" and "develop local industries." They disregard the overall and long-term interests of national production and construction, only seeking the local and immediate interests that are "profitable." Therefore, they illegally engage in indiscriminate logging and panic buying, destroying the mountains and forests, affecting the current basic construction of industry and mining, and harming the country's long-term industrial and agricultural production and construction.
  Indiscriminate Logging Leads to Panic Buying, Panic Buying Fuels Indiscriminate Logging
    The price of timber in the Central South region was originally lower than in other regions. Some organs and industrial and mining enterprises in other regions, some for construction needs, and some for hoarding and profiting, came to Wuhan, Hunan, Jiangxi and other places from as far away as Harbin, Shenyang, Chahar, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Shanghai, and northern Jiangsu to purchase timber. A yarn factory in Shanghai and a sack factory in northern Jiangsu even used their working capital to buy and hoard timber. Private merchants in Shanghai raised more than 360 billion yuan to hoard timber in Hunan. As a result of the panic buying, timber prices continued to rise. In March and April of this year, prices were more than double those at the beginning of the year, and in some areas of Jiangxi, they rose more than four times, while mountain prices did not increase. This price increase meant that farmers suffered from low prices, while high market prices increased investment in industrial and mining basic construction, and the profits from transporting and selling timber were as high as 100% or even 200%. The mountain price of timber in Xihua Mountain, Jiangxi, was only about 200,000 yuan per two yards, but it reached more than 600,000 yuan when transported to Dayu, and as high as 800,000 yuan when transported to Ganzhou. The mountain price in Hunan was more than 100,000 yuan per two yards, but it reached 600,000 to 700,000 yuan or even more than 1 million yuan when transported to markets such as Changsha. The Liuzhou Timber Procurement Office in Guangxi purchased logs with a girth of two feet and four inches for only 66,000 yuan and sold them to the Wuzhou Municipal People's Government for 158,000 yuan, making a profit of 155% in a single transaction. Because of the high profits, it further fueled indiscriminate logging. Some organs, troops, and schools in Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, and other provinces competed to engage in indiscriminate logging in mountainous areas. Because of competing interests, some places experienced the phenomenon of mutually detaining timber. Not long ago, the Liuzhou Timber Procurement Office detained timber sold by ethnic minority farmers Luo Guanghui and others to the Guangxi Military Region and forced them to sell it at a low price. Due to the transportation and sale of timber, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Central South made a profit of approximately 2 billion yuan in the first half of this year.
  Seriously Affected the Basic Construction of Industry and Mining
    This serious phenomenon of indiscriminate logging and panic buying has not completely stopped and has seriously affected the basic construction of industry and mining. The Jiangxi Timber Company established an office in Nanjing and another in Jiujiang, specializing in selling timber to East China and Shanghai. In the first half of this year, the company sold more than 52,000 cubic meters of timber and lumber to various organs in East China and transported them to Nanjing. However, on the other hand, the basic construction of non-ferrous metal mines in Jiangxi could not obtain sufficient timber supply. The basic construction of the Dajishan Mine in the province could not proceed due to lack of timber, and the earthwork project involving dozens of people could not be carried out. Now only a few people remain. The basic construction of the Xihua Mountain Mine has also been forced to stop work due to lack of materials, and 4,000 people are being forced to leave the mountain one after another. The Shaoyang and Yiyang special commissioner's offices in Hunan Province also established offices in Wuhan to operate timber in order to "subsidize finances," one in Hankou and one in Hanyang. According to the staff of the Yiyang office, from October last year to July this year, they transported and sold timber and lumber three times, totaling approximately 5,000 cubic meters. The last time was on July 26, after the Central South Region Forestry Work Conference had already made a decision to protect forests. The logistics department of a certain PLA unit stationed in the Lingling Special Zone of Hunan also operated timber business. The Commissioner's Office of the Liuzhou Special Zone in Guangxi Province successively established timber procurement offices in Liuzhou, Chang'an, Rongxian, Hekou, and Fulu in early June,抢购木材, freezing timber, lowering prices, and forcing purchases. The commissioner of the district ignored the provincial government's decree on unified management of timber and confronted the Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, who was sent by the provincial government to deal with timber issues, so that the unified management of timber in the province has not been carried out smoothly so far. Staff members of the Jiangxi Timber Company in Fuzhou Special Zone are still emphasizing "completing the logging task" and forcing farmers to sell trees under the pretext of "national needs."
  Incidents of Farmers Damaging Forests Continue to Occur
    After the chaotic phenomenon of panic buying and indiscriminate logging of timber occurred in Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi and other places, it aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the masses and has already produced the bad result of continuous damage to the mountains and forests. Some farmers said: "Cut trees on the mountain, carry soil down the mountain." That is to say, if the forests are cut down, the water and soil cannot be conserved, and the soil must be carried down the mountain to build embankments to prevent floods. The farmers in the Liuzhou Special Zone of Guangxi Province, because they were bought at low prices, said that "it is useless to plant trees in the future, and would rather let the timber rot on the mountain than transport it out for sale." This reflects the dissatisfaction of the farmers. Therefore, the poor and hired peasants in these areas are also not actively protecting the mountains and forests and preventing the sabotage of landlords, special agents, and bad elements, and the middle peasants are also not actively managing their own mountains and forests, and are allowing them to be damaged or destroying them themselves. Incidents of destroying mountains and forests have continued to occur in various places. In the first half of this year, 236 fires occurred in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces. Among them, Hunan had as many as 175 fires. In Jiangxi, there were 80 incidents of destroying mountains and forests last year, with losses amounting to 29.2 billion yuan in RMB. From January to April this year, there were a total of 61 cases of indiscriminate logging and fires, with losses amounting to more than 2.6 billion yuan in RMB. The main reason for the fires is the sabotage of landlords, special agents, and bad elements, followed by the masses' lack of attention to protecting the mountains and forests, resulting in fires during slash-and-burn cultivation and burning wild animals. What is serious is that it has been found in individual places that the masses are setting fires to the forests. In western Hunan, incidents of middle, poor and hired peasants setting fires to the forests have been discovered. Moreover, it has also been found that after a fire occurs, some people take the opportunity to engage in indiscriminate logging; in individual places, it has been found that one-tenth is burned during the fire, while nine-tenths are cut down by taking advantage of the opportunity. These serious phenomena of indiscriminate logging, destruction, and burning of mountains and forests should arouse the attention of local governments at all levels. Local governments at all levels should strictly implement the instructions of the State Council, unify timber management, stop indiscriminate logging and panic buying, and abolish unreasonable management methods formulated by various localities. They should earnestly lead the people to protect the mountains and forests, on the one hand, they should set an example, and on the other hand, they should strengthen patriotic education to farmers, so as to avoid the continued undue loss of the wealth of the people's motherland.

### 反对浪费木材，反对滥伐林木！  中南应彻底制止滥伐和抢购木材

　　反对浪费木材，反对滥伐林木！
    中南应彻底制止滥伐和抢购木材
    中南区江西、湖南两省及广西部分地区，自去年以来，曾发生滥伐山林抢购木材现象。今年四、五月间，各省实行了统一采伐木材的方针、采取了管理市场的措施以后，情况已有改善；但又产生了变相的垄断统制、压价强购、滥伐现象仍未完全停止。对于这种只顾局部利益，忽视国家生产建设的现象，当地领导机关应即依据政务院关于节约木材的指示，迅速加以改正。
  伐木已大大超出常年采伐量
    据了解，中南区今年已伐林木，已远超过于今年全区采伐计划。而去年全区的采伐木材量，亦曾超过了常年采伐量的百分之四十以上。今年江西现存木材即达全区今年采伐计划的百分之四十左右；加上已运出的木材、锯木料、方板料等，即达全区今年采伐计划的百分之六十左右。特别严重的是江西木材公司的采伐杉木的计划，竟超过了该省杉木年产量的百分之三十到一百六十。湖南省从一九四九年到一九五○年采伐的木材，约为一百万到一百二十万立方公尺，即超过常年采伐量一倍到两倍。
    产生这种滥伐现象的主要原因，是某些地方政府机关和个别部队“补助财政”、“发展地方工业”的地方主义和本位主义。他们不顾国家生产建设的整体的长远的利益，只图“有利可图”的局部的眼前的利益，因而违法滥伐抢购，破坏了山林，影响了目前工矿的基本建设，也损害了国家的长远的工农业生产建设。
  滥伐引起抢购，抢购助长滥伐
    中南区的木材价格，原比其他地区为低。其他地区的机关、工矿企业，有的是为了建设需要，有的却是为了囤积获利，远自哈尔滨、沈阳、察哈尔、太原、石家庄、上海、苏北等地，纷纷来到武汉、湖南、江西等地采购。上海某纱厂、苏北某麻袋厂，竟将生产上的流动资金用来购囤木材。上海私商竟集资三千六百多亿元到湖南进行囤购。抢购的结果，使木材价格不断上涨，今年三、四月间的价格竟比年初提高了一倍以上，江西某些地区竟高涨了四倍以上，而山价并未增加。这样的涨价，一方面是农民价低吃亏，一方面是市价高涨增加了工矿基本建设的投资，而运销木材的利润却高达百分之百以上，甚至有达百分之二百的。江西西华山木材山价每两码仅二十万元左右，运到大庾即达六十万元以上，到赣州却高达八十多万元。湖南山价每两码十多万元，运到长沙等市场，即达六、七十万元，甚至曾高达一百多万元。广西柳州采木办理处收购二尺四围原木仅六万六千元，卖给梧州市人民政府即提高到十五万八千元，转手间即获利百分之一百五十五。由于利润优厚，更助长了滥伐。江西、湖南、广西等省某些机关、部队、学校等，就曾竞相到山区滥伐。并因互争利益，有些地方发生了互相扣留木材的现象。柳州采木办理处，不久前，还扣留了三江少数民族农民罗光辉等卖给广西军区的木材，强迫他们低价出售。中南驻军某部因运销木材，今年上半年获利竟达二十亿元左右。
  严重地影响了工矿基本建设
    这种滥伐抢购的严重现象，至今没有完全停止，并已严重影响了工矿的基本建设。江西成立的木材公司，曾派出干部到南京设立办事处，并在九江也设立了办事处，专门向华东、上海等地销售木材。该公司在今年上半年，卖给华东各机关和运销南京的木材木料即达五万二千多立方公尺。但是，另一方面，江西有色金属矿山的基本建设却得不到足够的木材供应。该省大吉山矿山的基本建设，因缺乏木材，数十人的土木工程无法进行，现在只剩下了数人。西华山矿山的基本建设，也因停工待料，四千人正被迫络续离山。湖南省的邵阳、益阳两专署也为了“补助财政”，在武汉市设立了经营木材的办事处，一在汉口、一在汉阳。据益阳办事处人员谈：从去年十月到今年七月，他们运销了三次木材木料，共约五千多立方公尺。最后一次是七月二十六日，是在中南区林业工作会议已作出保护林木的决定以后。湖南零陵专区驻军某部后勤部也经营木材生意。广西柳州专区专员公署，竟于六月上旬起，在柳州、长安、融县、河口、富禄等地相继设立采木办理处，抢购木材，冻结木材，压低价格，强迫收买。该区专员竟对省人民政府颁布的统一管理林木的法令置之不理，并对抗省人民政府派去处理林木问题的农林厅副厅长等，以致该省木材统一管理工作至今没有顺利进行。江西省木材公司在抚州专区的工作人员，还在强调“完成伐木任务”，借口“国家需要”，强迫农民卖树。
  农民破坏山林事件不断发生
    江西、湖南、广西等地抢购、滥伐木材的混乱现象发生以后，引起了群众的普遍不满，并且已经产生了不断破坏山林的恶果。有的农民说：“山上砍树，下山担土”。就是说，山林被砍伐了，保持不住水土，山下就得担土垒堰，防止水灾了。广西柳州专区的农民，因为被压价收买，说是“今后造林没有用处了，宁愿木材在山上烂了，也不愿运出来卖了。”这反映了农民的不满。因此，各该地贫、雇农也不积极地来保护山林和防止地主、特务、坏分子的破坏，中农也不积极地来经营自己的山林，而且任凭破坏或自行破坏。各地破坏山林的事件，也就不断发生。今年上半年江西、湖南、广西三省即曾发生火灾二百三十六次。其中湖南即达一百七十五次。江西破坏山林的事件，去年曾达八十起，损失达人民币二百九十二亿元。今年一至四月份，共发生滥伐和火灾六十一处，损失达人民币二十六亿余元。发生火灾的原因，主要地是地主、特务、坏分子的破坏，其次是群众不注意保护山林，因而在烧山开荒、烧野兽等时引起火灾。严重的是，个别地方竟发现有群众放火烧林的。湘西即曾发现中、贫、雇农放火烧林的事件。而且还发现了在发生火灾后，有人乘机滥伐山林；个别地方竟发现在火灾时烧掉的是十分之一，而乘机砍掉的却是十分之九。这些滥伐、破坏、火烧山林的严重现象，亟应引起各级地方政府的注意。各级地方政府应严格执行政务院的指示，统一木材管理，制止滥伐抢购，废止各地自行制订的不合理的管理办法。切实领导人民保护山林，一方面以身作则，一方面对农民加强爱国教育，以免人民祖国的财富继续遭受不应有的损失。
