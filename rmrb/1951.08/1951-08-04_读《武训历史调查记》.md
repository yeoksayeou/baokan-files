Reading "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun"
    Guo Moruo

    I have read "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" several times. This is a factual record of "using scientific historical viewpoints to study and interpret history" (note). The truth and essence of Wu Xun, the person, and his "begging for education," as well as the social environment and dynamics of the era in which Wu Xun lived, are fully revealed here.

    The rediscovery of the story of Song Jing Shi, the leader of the Black Flag Army, is a very important excavation. Although Song Jing Shi's name occasionally appears in official historical records or private writings, it is mostly distorted or vague. Through this investigation, his birthplace, life story, character, and the motives, process, and outcome of his uprising have been thoroughly understood from the mouths of the existing working people, making this leader of the peasant revolution vividly appear before our eyes again.

    Song Jing Shi, who came from a tofu-selling background, was slightly older than Wu Xun, and their villages were only seven li apart. Song Jing Shi led the poor peasants of Xiaoliuguanzhuang in resisting the landlord group in Liulin Town and the reactionary Qing Dynasty. The vigorous battle continued for four years, echoing the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and coordinating with the Nian Army uprising, causing the Qing Dynasty to dispatch Senggelinqin's foreign gun team to deal with it. Although the struggle failed, it still lives in the hearts of the working people in Tangyi and Guantao. What was Wu Xun doing at this time? He was kneeling at the feet of the Liulin landlord group under the guise of "begging for education." Song Jing Shi's mortal enemies, the most stubborn Yongqing regiment commander Yang Mingqian and his nephew Yang Shufang, were Wu Xun's main backers. What other demonstration could be more vivid than this comparison? The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Army uprising were, geographically speaking, somewhat distant from Wu Xun, but the Black Flag Army uprising took place in the same region and during the same period, with such clear distinctions between friend and foe, and irreconcilable differences. If Wu Xun were still alive today, we would say he was a counter-revolutionary, and he would have nothing to say.

    The death of Wu Xun's mother when Wu Xun was thirty-five years old is also an important discovery. His begging was opposed by his mother and his elder brother Wu Qian, but he insisted on his own way. When his mother died, his brother wanted him to go home for mourning, but he wanted "crying money" and refused to go without "crying money." Wu Xun, who has been praised as a moralist for many years, was originally such an unfilial and undutiful person. His selection of many young widows to "recognize as godmothers" was also clearly a rogue act. Some people previously had a view of Wu Xun, thinking that he might be a mentally ill patient (the "disease" in "righteous school syndrome" is also evidence of this view), because his physiology was unsound, so he could do all kinds of strange behaviors, such as eating scorpions, eating bricks and tiles, and eating feces, and even not marrying. After this investigation, this pathological theory cannot exonerate Wu Xun either. Wu Xun's body was surprisingly strong, with a "waist as thick as a chopping board." As for his mind? He openly wanted to "recognize a hundred godmothers." Therefore, all his strange behaviors were undoubtedly feigning madness and playing the fool, and all were deceptions. And the so-called "establishing righteous schools" was, of course, the biggest deception.

    All the facts prove that Wu Xun was indeed a big rogue and a big liar. Because he had experience begging as a child, he tasted the pleasure of not working for food, and because he was not from the landlord class and was not allowed to not work for food, he decided to betray the working people and take the road of begging. Begging could not fully satisfy this desire not to work for food, so he further catered to the ruling class's policy of deceiving the people and raised the banner of "establishing righteous schools." This guy seemed to be a genius of deception. Although he said he was illiterate, he did have plenty of scheming. He only did easy work for one or two years in his life. Apart from that, he performed a rogue biography of deception and extortion, from small-scale deception and extortion to large-scale deception and extortion. From estimating and selling fields to making huge profits, he specialized in exploiting the poor working people with high interest rates of thirty percent. Furthermore, from high-interest exploitation, he progressed to land exploitation. The three "land account books" show that Wu Xun's nearly three hundred mu of land came from the plunder of many small pieces of land of about one or two mu each. This is irrefutable evidence, from the extraction of blood and marrow to the squeezing of life. To engage in these cruel extraction activities, it was necessary to form deep alliances with the established evil forces to ensure protection, so he knelt down at the feet of the big landlords, big bullies, and big gentry, relying on them for shelter. In addition, he absorbed some small rogues around him to form a gang, making himself the central force of this gang. In this way, his wings became full, and he finally made connections with officials, alarming the Qing Dynasty, which recognized that he was a force that could be used and utilized him. From this point of view, Wu Xun was indeed successful. A fool who pretended to be crazy and beg for food won the favor of the so-called court, was granted plaques and commendations, had his biography entered into the National History Museum, and was allowed to extort and exploit, which was indeed unprecedented in history. But just from this indication alone, isn't it already fully demonstrating the reactionary nature of Wu Xun?

    The so-called "righteous schools" run by Wu Xun completely served the reactionary ruling class, which is as clear as daylight today. But contrary to what the eulogists of Wu Xun have propagated, the "righteous schools" run by Wu Xun specifically catered to the backwardness of feudal society. He not only had no intention of improving this backwardness, but also wanted to preserve and consolidate it desperately. Not only were these so-called "righteous schools" like this, but the charitable book society he participated in, and the "Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian," "Wen Chang Di Jun Yin Zhi Wen," "Zao Wang Jing," "Persuasion to the World" and other publications he published, were also completely backward propaganda materials of the landlord class to consolidate reactionary rule, and Wu Xun was a diligent promoter of these propaganda materials. Wu Xun can truly be said to be a crystallization of feudal society. He embodied the great rogue, the great liar, the big landlord, the big usurer, the great celebrity, the great philanthropist, the great idol... all in one person, truly a great collection of feudal reactionary backward forces.

    The gold plating on Wu Xun's sacredness, benevolence, and righteousness has been completely stripped off today. After reading this "Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," anyone who has praised and worshipped Wu Xun, unless they are deliberately reactionary, or are still deliberately engaging in counter-revolutionary conspiracies under the people's democratic regime, who would not be astonished and deeply self-reflective? I myself must also re-examine myself once again. I also echoed the praise of Wu Xun. At the Chongqing Wu Xun Commemoration Meeting in the winter of 1945, I made an extremely exaggerated speech about Wu Xun's so-called "achievements" (this speech was actually recorded and published, and was selected into the "National Language Selection" published by the East China Xinhua Bookstore in 1948, and I only recently learned and saw it). Last year, I wrote the title and inscription for "Wu Xun's Pictorial Biography," which were two very big mistakes. I believe that Mr. Tao Xingzhi also made a very big mistake during his lifetime. Many of Wu Xun's eulogists and worshippers were actually blindly echoing under the influence of Tao Xingzhi's praise of Wu Xun. This blind echo was most concretely, most concentratedly, and most exaggeratedly expressed in Sun Yu's film "The Life of Wu Xun." The praise and worship of Wu Xun formed a peak here, and it appeared today when the people's revolution has triumphed, which is really no small matter. If Mr. Tao were still alive today, with his spirit of courageously seeking progress, he would definitely make a very profound self-examination. Not only is Wu Xun not worthy of being a model, but Tao Xingzhi's praise of Wu Xun is also not worthy of being a model. Today, we must never "conceal the faults of the virtuous."

    Here, I would like to add some opinions to the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." The film "The Life of Wu Xun" has exceeded the boundaries of Tao Xingzhi's praise of Wu Xun. Mr. Tao's mistake was that he did not look at Wu Xun from the essence, and did not link Wu Xun's behavior with revolutionary movements such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Army uprising. His praise can be said to be blind praise, or it can be said to be deceived by Wu Xun and the reactionaryæ´¾ throughout history. But the film "The Life of Wu Xun" is different. The author, Sun Yu, clearly knew that Wu Xun's activity period was the height of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution. He imagined a revolutionary figure "Zhou Da" to match Wu Xun, forming the so-called "one civil and one martial." "Zhou Da" participated in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution in the film, and Wu Xun consciously opposed "Zhou Da," wanting to take a different path. The result was that "Zhou Da" failed, while Wu Xun became the "most courageous and benevolent" "person of all ages." Such praise has exceeded blind eulogy and progressed to distorting the revolution. This is one of the biggest tumors in the film "The Life of Wu Xun." This contrast that distorts the revolution is a main thread of the entire film, and we very much hope that the author can make a clear review of this. Other embellishments and distortions, although generally following the embellishments and distortions of predecessors, are also intentionally exaggerated.

    The criticism of Wu Xun is indeed a good ideological education work, especially after the publication of "Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," which revealed Wu Xun the person and his deeds so clearly that everyone (including myself) could experience a deeper level of understanding and application of historical materialism in specific matters. This has made a great contribution to clarifying the ideological confusion in the cultural and educational circles. The reason why "Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" has the power to clarify ideological confusion is because the method is correct and it directly records the opinions of the working people. This is a new element that has been almost absent in historical works in the past. This criticism work and investigation work has added a glorious page to China's people's history. We express our congratulations for this achievement in ideological work.
