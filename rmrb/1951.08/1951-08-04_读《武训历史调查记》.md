Reading "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun"
    Guo Moruo

    I have read "A Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" several times. This is a factual record of "using scientific historical viewpoints to study and interpret history" (note). The truth and essence of Wu Xun, the person, and his "begging for education," as well as the social environment and dynamics of the era in which Wu Xun lived, are fully revealed here.

    The rediscovery of the story of Song Jing Shi, the leader of the Black Flag Army, is a very important excavation. Although Song Jing Shi's name occasionally appears in official historical records or private writings, it is mostly distorted or vague. Through this investigation, his birthplace, life story, character, and the motives, process, and outcome of his uprising have been thoroughly understood from the mouths of the existing working people, making this leader of the peasant revolution vividly appear before our eyes again.

    Song Jing Shi, who came from a tofu-selling background, was slightly older than Wu Xun, and their villages were only seven li apart. Song Jing Shi led the poor peasants of Xiaoliuguanzhuang in resisting the landlord group in Liulin Town and the reactionary Qing Dynasty. The vigorous battle continued for four years, echoing the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and coordinating with the Nian Army uprising, causing the Qing Dynasty to dispatch Senggelinqin's foreign gun team to deal with it. Although the struggle failed, it still lives in the hearts of the working people in Tangyi and Guantao. What was Wu Xun doing at this time? He was kneeling at the feet of the Liulin landlord group under the guise of "begging for education." Song Jing Shi's mortal enemies, the most stubborn Yongqing regiment commander Yang Mingqian and his nephew Yang Shufang, were Wu Xun's main backers. What other demonstration could be more vivid than this comparison? The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Army uprising were, geographically speaking, somewhat distant from Wu Xun, but the Black Flag Army uprising took place in the same region and during the same period, with such clear distinctions between friend and foe, and irreconcilable differences. If Wu Xun were still alive today, we would say he was a counter-revolutionary, and he would have nothing to say.

    The death of Wu Xun's mother when Wu Xun was thirty-five years old is also an important discovery. His begging was opposed by his mother and his elder brother Wu Qian, but he insisted on his own way. When his mother died, his brother wanted him to go home for mourning, but he wanted "crying money" and refused to go without "crying money." Wu Xun, who has been praised as a moralist for many years, was originally such an unfilial and undutiful person. His selection of many young widows to "recognize as godmothers" was also clearly a rogue act. Some people previously had a view of Wu Xun, thinking that he might be a mentally ill patient (the "disease" in "righteous school syndrome" is also evidence of this view), because his physiology was unsound, so he could do all kinds of strange behaviors, such as eating scorpions, eating bricks and tiles, and eating feces, and even not marrying. After this investigation, this pathological theory cannot exonerate Wu Xun either. Wu Xun's body was surprisingly strong, with a "waist as thick as a chopping board." As for his mind? He openly wanted to "recognize a hundred godmothers." Therefore, all his strange behaviors were undoubtedly feigning madness and playing the fool, and all were deceptions. And the so-called "establishing righteous schools" was, of course, the biggest deception.

    All the facts prove that Wu Xun was indeed a big rogue and a big liar. Because he had experience begging as a child, he tasted the pleasure of not working for food, and because he was not from the landlord class and was not allowed to not work for food, he decided to betray the working people and take the road of begging. Begging could not fully satisfy this desire not to work for food, so he further catered to the ruling class's policy of deceiving the people and raised the banner of "establishing righteous schools." This guy seemed to be a genius of deception. Although he said he was illiterate, he did have plenty of scheming. He only did easy work for one or two years in his life. Apart from that, he performed a rogue biography of deception and extortion, from small-scale deception and extortion to large-scale deception and extortion. From estimating and selling fields to making huge profits, he specialized in exploiting the poor working people with high interest rates of thirty percent. Furthermore, from high-interest exploitation, he progressed to land exploitation. The three "land account books" show that Wu Xun's nearly three hundred mu of land came from the plunder of many small pieces of land of about one or two mu each. This is irrefutable evidence, from the extraction of blood and marrow to the squeezing of life. To engage in these cruel extraction activities, it was necessary to form deep alliances with the established evil forces to ensure protection, so he knelt down at the feet of the big landlords, big bullies, and big gentry, relying on them for shelter. In addition, he absorbed some small rogues around him to form a gang, making himself the central force of this gang. In this way, his wings became full, and he finally made connections with officials, alarming the Qing Dynasty, which recognized that he was a force that could be used and utilized him. From this point of view, Wu Xun was indeed successful. A fool who pretended to be crazy and beg for food won the favor of the so-called court, was granted plaques and commendations, had his biography entered into the National History Museum, and was allowed to extort and exploit, which was indeed unprecedented in history. But just from this indication alone, isn't it already fully demonstrating the reactionary nature of Wu Xun?

    The so-called "righteous schools" run by Wu Xun completely served the reactionary ruling class, which is as clear as daylight today. But contrary to what the eulogists of Wu Xun have propagated, the "righteous schools" run by Wu Xun specifically catered to the backwardness of feudal society. He not only had no intention of improving this backwardness, but also wanted to preserve and consolidate it desperately. Not only were these so-called "righteous schools" like this, but the charitable book society he participated in, and the "Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian," "Wen Chang Di Jun Yin Zhi Wen," "Zao Wang Jing," "Persuasion to the World" and other publications he published, were also completely backward propaganda materials of the landlord class to consolidate reactionary rule, and Wu Xun was a diligent promoter of these propaganda materials. Wu Xun can truly be said to be a crystallization of feudal society. He embodied the great rogue, the great liar, the big landlord, the big usurer, the great celebrity, the great philanthropist, the great idol... all in one person, truly a great collection of feudal reactionary backward forces.

    The gold plating on Wu Xun's sacredness, benevolence, and righteousness has been completely stripped off today. After reading this "Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," anyone who has praised and worshipped Wu Xun, unless they are deliberately reactionary, or are still deliberately engaging in counter-revolutionary conspiracies under the people's democratic regime, who would not be astonished and deeply self-reflective? I myself must also re-examine myself once again. I also echoed the praise of Wu Xun. At the Chongqing Wu Xun Commemoration Meeting in the winter of 1945, I made an extremely exaggerated speech about Wu Xun's so-called "achievements" (this speech was actually recorded and published, and was selected into the "National Language Selection" published by the East China Xinhua Bookstore in 1948, and I only recently learned and saw it). Last year, I wrote the title and inscription for "Wu Xun's Pictorial Biography," which were two very big mistakes. I believe that Mr. Tao Xingzhi also made a very big mistake during his lifetime. Many of Wu Xun's eulogists and worshippers were actually blindly echoing under the influence of Tao Xingzhi's praise of Wu Xun. This blind echo was most concretely, most concentratedly, and most exaggeratedly expressed in Sun Yu's film "The Life of Wu Xun." The praise and worship of Wu Xun formed a peak here, and it appeared today when the people's revolution has triumphed, which is really no small matter. If Mr. Tao were still alive today, with his spirit of courageously seeking progress, he would definitely make a very profound self-examination. Not only is Wu Xun not worthy of being a model, but Tao Xingzhi's praise of Wu Xun is also not worthy of being a model. Today, we must never "conceal the faults of the virtuous."

    Here, I would like to add some opinions to the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." The film "The Life of Wu Xun" has exceeded the boundaries of Tao Xingzhi's praise of Wu Xun. Mr. Tao's mistake was that he did not look at Wu Xun from the essence, and did not link Wu Xun's behavior with revolutionary movements such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Army uprising. His praise can be said to be blind praise, or it can be said to be deceived by Wu Xun and the reactionary派 throughout history. But the film "The Life of Wu Xun" is different. The author, Sun Yu, clearly knew that Wu Xun's activity period was the height of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution. He imagined a revolutionary figure "Zhou Da" to match Wu Xun, forming the so-called "one civil and one martial." "Zhou Da" participated in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution in the film, and Wu Xun consciously opposed "Zhou Da," wanting to take a different path. The result was that "Zhou Da" failed, while Wu Xun became the "most courageous and benevolent" "person of all ages." Such praise has exceeded blind eulogy and progressed to distorting the revolution. This is one of the biggest tumors in the film "The Life of Wu Xun." This contrast that distorts the revolution is a main thread of the entire film, and we very much hope that the author can make a clear review of this. Other embellishments and distortions, although generally following the embellishments and distortions of predecessors, are also intentionally exaggerated.

    The criticism of Wu Xun is indeed a good ideological education work, especially after the publication of "Historical Investigation of Wu Xun," which revealed Wu Xun the person and his deeds so clearly that everyone (including myself) could experience a deeper level of understanding and application of historical materialism in specific matters. This has made a great contribution to clarifying the ideological confusion in the cultural and educational circles. The reason why "Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" has the power to clarify ideological confusion is because the method is correct and it directly records the opinions of the working people. This is a new element that has been almost absent in historical works in the past. This criticism work and investigation work has added a glorious page to China's people's history. We express our congratulations for this achievement in ideological work.

### 读《武训历史调查记》

　　读《武训历史调查记》
    郭沫若
    《武训历史调查记》我返复读了几遍，这是“用科学的历史观点，研究和解释历史”（注）的一篇实事求是的记载。武训其人及其“行乞兴学”的真相和本质、武训所处的社会环境和时代动态，在这儿是表露无遗了。
    黑旗军领袖宋景诗遗事的重见天日，首先就是很重要的一项发掘。宋景诗的名字虽然也偶尔散见于官家史志或私人著述之类，但大都是被歪曲了的，或语焉不详的。经过这一次的调查，把他的籍贯、身世、性格和他起义的动机、经过、结局，从现存的劳动人民口中得到了一个究竟，使这位农民革命的领袖人物又活鲜鲜地呈现到了我们的眼前。
    卖豆腐出身的宋景诗，年岁或略长于武训，乡里则只隔七里。宋景诗领导着小刘贯庄的贫苦农民对柳林镇的地主集团抗战，对反动的满清王朝抗战。轰轰烈烈的战斗继续了四年之久，与太平天国相呼应，与捻军起义相犄角，致使满清王朝发动了僧格林沁的洋枪队前来对付。斗争虽然失败了，但它至今都还活存在堂邑、馆陶一带劳动人民的心里。武训在这时是怎样呢？他正在打起“行乞兴学”的幌子跪拜在柳林地主集团的脚下。宋景诗的死敌，最顽恶的永清团团长杨鸣谦和杨树坊两叔侄，却正是武训的主要靠山。还有什么论证，能比这一对照，更为鲜明的呢？太平天国和捻军起义，从地域上来说，诚然和武训还有点相隔，但这黑旗军的起义是在同一区域里面同一个时期的事，而这样敌友分明，水火不相济。假使武训还活在今天，我们要说他是反革命分子，他也会是哑口无言的。
    武训的母亲死在武训三十五岁的时候，也是重要的一个发现。他的行乞为他母亲和哥哥武谦所反对，而他一意孤行了。母亲死时，他的哥哥要他回家服丧，他竟要“哭钱”，没有“哭钱”不肯去。多年来被歌颂为道德家的武训，原来就是这样的不孝不悌之人。他选了许多年青寡妇“拜干娘”，也显然是一种流氓的恶行。好些人在前对于武训还有一种看法，以为他或许是一位精神病患者（“义学症”的症字也是这种看法的一证），因为他生理不健全，故能做出那种种怪行，如吃蝎子，吃砖瓦，吃粪便之类，而至于不结婚。经过了这一次的调查，这种病理学的说法，也不能为武训开脱了。武训的身体是壮健得惊人的，“腰有案板那样粗”。精神呢？他公然要“认一百个干娘”。因此，他的一切怪行，毫无疑问地都是装疯卖傻，都是欺骗。而所谓“兴义学”，当然也就是最大的欺骗了。
    一切事实证明，武训的确是一个大流氓，大骗子。他因为小时曾经有过行乞的经验，领略了不劳而食的滋味，又因为他本不是地主阶级，不允许他不劳而食，故决心背叛了劳动人民，而采取了行乞的道路。行乞也并不能充分满足这种不劳而食的要求，故又更进一步迎合统治阶级的愚民政策，而打起“兴义学”的幌子。这家伙，倒似乎是一位欺骗的天才。他尽管说是不识字，而确实是有充分的心计的。他生平只干了一两年的轻松的活，除此之外便演出了一部欺骗讹诈的流氓列传，由小型的欺骗讹诈进展到大型的欺骗讹诈。由估卖田产而大利盘剥，以三分的高利专一剥削贫苦的劳动人民。更由高利的剥削进展到土地的剥削，三本“地亩账”，表明着武训的将近三百亩土地的来源包括许多一二亩左右零星土地的掠夺。这是铁案难移的证据，由血髓的抽吸进展到生命的榨取了。要干这些残酷的榨取勾当，是必须和既成的恶势力深相结托才能有保障的，故拜倒在大地主、大恶霸、大豪绅等的脚下而仰仗他们庇护；另外又吸收些小流氓在自己周围而形成一个帮口，使自己成为这个帮口的中心势力；这样他的羽翼就丰满了，而终至于交官达府，耸动了满清王朝，使满清王朝也认识到他是可以利用的势力，而加以利用了。从这一点来讲，武训倒的确是成功了的。一个装疯卖傻的叫花子而博得了所谓朝廷的青睐，赐匾旌表，宣付国史馆立传，恩准讹诈剥削，倒的确是历史上前所未有的事。但就单从这一迹相来看，不已经充分表明着武训的反动性的本质了吗？
    武训所兴办的所谓“义学”，完全是为反动的统治阶级服务的，在今天已经是明如观火了。但和武训的歌颂者所宣传的相反，武训所办的“义学”专门迎合封建社会的落后性，他不仅没有丝毫改进这落后性的意思，而且是死死地想保存着它，巩固着它的。不仅这所谓“义学”是这样，他所参加的善书会，所刊布的一些“太上感应篇”，“文昌帝君阴骘文”，“灶王经”、“劝世文”等等，也完全是地主阶级巩固反动统制的落后宣传品，而武训是这些宣传品努力推销者。武训倒真可以说是封建社会的一个结晶。他以一人之身而兼备了大流氓、大骗子、大地主、大债主、大名人、大善士、大偶像……真可谓集封建反动落后势力之大成了。
    武训圣神仁义的装金，今天是完全剥掉了。读了这篇《武训历史调查记》，曾经歌颂武训、崇拜武训的人，假使不是存心反动，不是在人民民主政权之下还蓄意进行反革命的诡计，谁不会瞠然自失而深刻检讨呢？我自己也就要重新再检讨一次。我对于武训的歌颂也曾经附和过。我曾在一九四五年冬重庆武训纪念会上对武训的所谓“功绩”作过一次极其夸张的发言（这次发言竟被人记录发表，并且被选入一九四八年华东新华书店所出的《国语文选》中，直到最近我才知道和看到），去年我又替《武训画传》写了书名和题辞，实在是犯了两个很大的错误。陶行知先生生前，我认为也是犯了很大的错误。有好些武训的歌颂者和崇拜者，事实上是受了陶行知表扬武训的影响而盲目附和的。这一盲目附和的绝大部分，最具体、最集中、最夸大地表现了在孙瑜的电影《武训传》里。武训歌颂和崇拜在这儿形成了一个最高峰，而且出现在人民革命胜利了的今天，实在不是一件小事。陶先生如果还生存在今天，以他那勇于求进步的精神，他一定会极深刻地作出一番自我检讨的。不仅武训不足为训，就是陶行知的表扬武训也同样不足为训，我们今天是决不能“为贤者讳”了。
    我在这里想对电影《武训传》的批评补充一点意见。电影《武训传》的表扬武训是超过了陶行知的界线的。陶先生的错误是在不曾从本质上去看武训，不曾把武训的行为和太平天国与捻军起义等革命运动联系起来看，他的表扬可以说为盲目的表扬，也可以说是受了武训和历来反动派的欺骗。但电影《武训传》不同，作者孙瑜是明明知道武训的活动期间正是太平天国革命的高潮期。他假想了一个革命人物“周大”出来，和武训配成了所谓“一文一武”。“周大”在电影中参加了太平天国的革命，武训有意识地和“周大”对立，要走不同的路。结果是“周大”失败了，而武训却成了“至勇至仁”的“千古一人”。这样的表扬就超过了盲目歌颂，而进展到歪曲革命了。这是电影《武训传》的一个最大的毒瘤。这一歪曲革命的对比是全电影的一条主线，我们很希望作者对此能作一明确的检讨。其它的粉饰歪曲，大体上虽是沿袭了前人的粉饰歪曲，但也有意夸大化了。
    关于武训的批判，确实是进行了一次很好的思想教育工作，尤其经过《武训历史调查记》的发表，把武训其人及其事揭露得可谓一清二白，使大家（包含我自己在内）在具体事项中得以体会到历史唯物主义的更深一境的认识和运用，这在澄清文化界和教育界的思想混乱上是有很大的贡献的。《武训历史调查记》之所以能有澄清思想混乱的力量，是因为方法正确，而且直接记录了劳动人民的意见。这是向来的历史述作里面所几乎没有的新的成分，这一次的批判工作和调查工作为中国的人民史学增加了光辉的一页，我们为这一思想工作上的成就表示庆贺。
