Literary and art workers in our country, including Liu Baiyu, who participated in directing and producing the films "The Victory of the Chinese People" and "Liberated China" and won the Stalin Prize for Literature and Art, wrote to Chairman Mao on August 11 to pay their respects. The original letter is as follows:

Dear Chairman Mao:

We have been awarded the glorious Stalin Prize for Literature and Art, and this glory belongs to you. For thirty years, you have used Marxism-Leninism to lead the Chinese people to overcome countless difficulties and experience countless twists and turns, finally achieving a world-historical victory. The reason why "The Victory of the Chinese People" and "Liberated China" are loved by the Soviet people and the people of the world is mainly because they initially and concisely express the brilliant revolutionary history created by the Chinese people under your leadership and inspiration.

In the production of the two films, we mainly relied on the efforts of Soviet comrades and the leadership and support of many leading comrades in the Central Committee. Our individual efforts were small. We regard the awarding of this prize as a national honor and as an expression of the infinite love of the Soviet people, nurtured by Stalin, for the Chinese people led by you. Please accept our respects and wish you eternal health!

　　荣获斯大林奖金的文艺工作者上书毛主席致敬
    【本报讯】参加编导及摄制《中国人民的胜利》、《解放了的中国》两部影片而荣获斯大林文艺奖金的我国文艺工作者刘白羽等十二人，八月十一日上书毛主席致敬。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们获得了光荣的斯大林文艺奖金，这光荣是属于你的。三十年来，你运用马列主义，领导中国人民克服了无数困难，经历了无数曲折，终于获得了世界历史性的胜利。《中国人民的胜利》《解放了的中国》的所以为苏联人民和全世界人民所爱好，主要的是因为它们最初地、简洁地表现了在你领导和鼓舞之下中国人民所创造的光辉灿烂的革命史实的缘故。
    在两部影片的制作过程中，主要的是依靠苏联同志的努力和中央许多领导同志的领导和支持，我们个人的尽力是微小的，我们把这次奖金的获得，当作国家的荣誉，当作斯大林教养的苏联人民，对你所领导的中国人民的无限亲爱的表现。请你接受我们的敬意，祝你永远健康！
