Overcome Natural Disasters and Strive for a Bumper Autumn Harvest!
Farmers in Various Regions Resolutely Carry Out Disaster Resistance Struggle

Currently, farmers across the country, after winning the summer harvest, are working hard to overcome drought, floods, insect pests, hail, and other disasters, striving for a bumper autumn harvest.

In early and mid-July, most parts of the country had abundant rainfall, and various crops grew well. Early rice in the Jiangnan region has already achieved a bumper harvest. However, some regions, such as Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Hebei, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and parts of the Northwest and Southwest, experienced varying degrees of drought, affecting the sowing of autumn crops and the growth of early-sown crops, resulting in losses in agricultural production. Since mid-July, up to early August, these drought-affected areas have received rainfall successively, and the drought situation has been largely relieved. Under the leadership of the People's Government and with the help of loans and seeds, farmers in these affected areas are now urgently rushing to sow buckwheat, vegetables, and other late-autumn crops.

Since mid-July, rainfall in various regions has initially relieved the drought.

Chahar was the most severely affected by drought. In early July, 5 million mu in the province were severely affected by drought. In severely affected areas, 50% to 60% of the seedlings died due to drought, and most needed to be replanted or supplemented. After July 18th, the province received three rainfalls successively, and the seedlings have begun to recover, with the possibility of achieving 50% of a normal harvest. After the rain, the Party and government leading organs and various administrative offices immediately urgently mobilized more than 900 cadres to go to the countryside to lead farmers in drought resistance and preparedness for famine, and also allocated a large number of water conservancy loans and late-autumn crop seeds. By July 24th, 1.78 million mu of land that needed to be replanted or supplemented in the Chahar South Special Zone had been basically rushed to completion, and other special zones had also largely completed rushing to plant. Since June, Suiyuan Province has generally experienced drought, and crop growth has been weak. After rain fell in mid-to-late July, except for the Ikezhao League, other areas no longer lack rain, and most of the late crops have been rushed to planting. Xingxian and Xinxian Special Zones in Shanxi Province were more severely affected by drought. Before the rain on July 20th, more than 1 million mu had not been sown or seedlings had not emerged after sowing. After the rain, farmers are rushing to plant and supplement planting. In Hebei Province, 7 special zones north of the Shide Railway line suffered drought damage to more than 17 million mu, and seedling growth was not good. Rain fell successively in late July, and the drought situation has been relieved. Since June, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has generally lacked rain. By the end of June, 28% of the cultivated land had not been sown due to drought, and another 27% of the cultivated land had not emerged after sowing or had emerged less than 20%. Farmers in various leagues launched a fierce struggle against the drought, digging wells and watering the land. In Jerim League, more than 10,000 wells have been dug in Kailu and Tongliao alone. Recently, eastern Inner Mongolia received soaking rain, and the drought situation in the entire region is no longer severe. Farmers are rushing to plant late-autumn crops. Parts of Ningxia, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces in the Northwest region were also very dry in early July. Among them, Yanchi, Tongxin, and Taole counties in Ningxia Province were the most severely affected by drought. Most of the autumn fields were not sown, and 20% of the summer field seedlings were killed by drought. After three soaking rains fell after July 13th, local farmers are rushing to plant late crops to prepare for overcoming the famine. In most areas of the Southwest, a serious drought occurred in May and June. Continuous rainfall in early July has improved the situation. Cracked rice fields in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Xikang provinces have mostly been filled with rainwater, rice seedlings have recovered, and dry land is being intensively supplemented with sweet potatoes, buckwheat, and green beans. In Tongzi and Zhenyuan in Guizhou Province, rain fell successively on July 9th and 10th, and the drought situation is no longer severe. In Duyun County, there is still insufficient rainfall in some highlands.

In Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other provinces, rain and floods caused disasters, and local governments actively led drainage and rescue efforts.

In some other areas, such as Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Henan, Pingyuan, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces, there was excessive rainfall in mid-July, and in some areas, dikes collapsed and mountain floods broke out, flooding more than 3 million mu of farmland. After the disasters occurred in various places, the local people's governments immediately organized farmers to urgently drain and rescue, and some flooded fields have been rescued from danger. Within ten days of the disaster, farmers in the Southern Jiangsu region had rescued most of the 1.2 million mu of flooded land, and now only 270,000 mu of 　fields (reclaimed reed fields) remain, which have not been drained due to the low terrain. In southern Anhui, mountain floods broke out, submerging more than 600,000 mu of farmland. Under the correct leadership of the local people's government, farmers overcame pessimism and waiting, as well as ideas of relying on relief, and actively carried out drainage and rescue. In Wuhu, Nanling, Dangtu, and other eight counties alone, 17,700 dragon bone waterwheels were organized, mobilizing more than 70,000 male and female workers, working in shifts day and night to drain water. Farmers are replanting rice seedlings in the drained fields, and farmers in Nanling County planted 25,000 mu in five days. In this rescue of waterlogging in southern Anhui, the machine drainage station in Yitaiwei, Wuhu County, played a significant role, draining 84,000 gallons per minute. By July 27th, it had completely drained the accumulated water from 30,000 mu of rice fields in the weir. More than 1 million mu flooded in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Zhejiang, Henan, and other places have been mostly rescued and are still being drained. In Pingyuan Province, dikes broke on the Weihe river in Anyang and Puyang Special Zones, flooding more than 600,000 mu of farmland. Drainage and rescue efforts are underway, and the breach in the Weihe River has been blocked. In parts of Yunnan, northern Sichuan, southern Sichuan, and western Sichuan provinces in the Southwest region, torrential rains caused disasters around July 10th, washing away embankments and submerging more than 60,000 mu of farmland. People's governments at all levels have mobilized farmers to rescue and replant.

During the several rainfalls in July, some areas experienced storms with hail, causing disasters. The hailstorm disaster in Handan and Xingtai Special Zones in Hebei Province was serious. In Xingtai Special Zone, hail destroyed seedlings on more than 500,000 mu, of which 250,000 mu had no hope of harvest and must be replanted. In July, Suiyuan, Pingyuan, Shandong, and other provinces had a total of more than 300,000 mu affected by hailstorms. In the four provinces of Northeast China, Jilin, western Liaoning, eastern Liaoning, and Heilongjiang, hailstorms successively damaged crops on about 1.1 million mu in July. After the hailstorms occurred in various places, the provincial or county people's governments have organized consolation groups, carrying relief grain to the disaster areas to express condolences, and have organized farmers to replant or replant.

Various insect pests continue to occur and spread.
Farmers in various places are urgently carrying out elimination and control.

After wiping out summer locusts spreading over more than 7 million mu, farmers in Hebei, Shandong, northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Xinjiang, and other provinces and regions are now launching a struggle to wipe out autumn locusts. Autumn locusts have occurred in 340,000 mu in Hebei Province, which is more serious in the coastal areas near Tianjin Special Zone. The Central People's Government has decided to send two aircraft to assist in the extermination. Autumn locusts have also been sporadically discovered in Shandong, Hubei, and other places. People's governments at all levels are mobilizing the masses to investigate and dig up locust eggs and capture and beat down the autumn nymphs that have emerged from the soil.

Cotton aphids have occurred universally in various cotton-producing areas: 70% of the cotton fields in the North China region have been affected by aphids; in the Northeast region, 60% of the cotton fields in the three provinces of western Liaoning, eastern Liaoning, and Rehe have had aphids; cotton aphids have universally occurred in cotton fields in Shandong Province; in addition, cotton fields in Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and various places in the Southwest have also successively suffered from aphid infestation. Among them, Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shandong are more serious. After the Party and government leading organs in these areas led farmers to concentrate all their efforts to eliminate and control, the damage caused by cotton aphids has been reduced by 50% to 80%. Aphid infestation in the cotton-producing areas of Central South, Northwest, and Southwest China has been basically eliminated. The development of aphid infestation in the cotton-producing areas of eastern Liaoning Province in Northeast China has stopped. Spider mites are currently spreading and developing. Spider mites have been found to be harmful in more than 1.1 million mu of cotton fields in Hebei Province. They have also occurred in Shandong, Pingyuan, and other places. Farmers in various places are urgently carrying out elimination and control.

Rice borers in the rice-producing areas of East China and Central South China have stopped spreading after farmers in various places vigorously captured them. In Zhejiang, Fujian, and Hunan provinces alone, more than 8 million people were mobilized to capture more than 500 million moths and collect more than 40 million egg masses. However, it is currently the incubation period of the third generation of borers, and there is still a possibility of borer infestation.

Armyworms and cutworms have occurred in large numbers in the coarse grain-producing areas of Northeast China, North China, and other regions. Armyworms in Dezhou Special Zone, Shandong Province, were particularly harmful. After farmers in various places vigorously captured them, the insect pest infestation has trended downwards. Cutworms in eastern Liaoning Province have been completely eliminated. It is currently the fastest period for armyworms to transform into moths to lay eggs and hatch. Various places still need to pay close attention and continuously carry out elimination and control.

Due to abnormal climate, alternating droughts and floods, and continuous occurrence and spread of insect pests, all of this has formed a serious threat to agricultural production. Farmers in various places have overcome natural disasters in the spring and summer seasons and won bumper harvests of wheat and early rice, but the threat of various natural disasters still exists. Party and government leading organs at all levels are paying close attention to the occurrence of disasters such as drought, flood, insect pests, and hail, and are leading the masses of farmers to carry out prevention, rescue, and pest control work.

　　战胜自然灾害，争取秋季丰收！
    各地农民坚决进行抗灾斗争
    目前全国各地农民，在赢得夏季丰收之后，正努力克服旱涝虫雹等灾害，为争取秋季丰收而奋斗。
    七月上中旬，全国大部地区雨量充沛，各种作物生长良好，江南早稻已获丰收。但有些地区，如察哈尔、绥远、山西、河北、内蒙古自治区，及西北、西南等地的部分地区，却发生了轻重不等的旱象，影响了大秋作物的播种和早播作物的成长，造成了农业生产上的损失。各受旱地区，七月中旬以来，至八月初，均先后落雨，旱象基本解除。这些受害地区的农民在人民政府的领导和贷款贷种的扶助下，正紧张抢种荞麦、蔬菜等晚秋作物。
    七月中旬以来各地先后降雨受旱地区旱象已经初步解除
    察哈尔受旱最重，七月初全省有五百万亩遭受旱灾严重地区，禾苗旱死百分之五十到六十，大部需改种补种，七月十八日以后该省先后降雨三次，禾苗已见复苏，可争取五成年景。雨后，该省党政领导机关及各专署立即紧急动员九百多干部下乡领导农民进行抗旱备荒，同时并拨发大批水利贷款和晚秋作物种籽，到七月二十四日，察南专区一百七十八万亩应改种和补种的地已基本抢种完毕，其他专区也大部抢种完毕。绥远全省六月以来普遍干旱，作物生长不旺，七月中下旬先后落雨，目前除伊克昭盟外，其他地区已不缺雨，晚庄稼已大部抢种完毕。山西省兴县、忻县两专区受旱较重，七月二十日落雨前，曾有一百余万亩尚未下种或下种未出苗，得雨后正抢种、补种。河北省石德线以北七个专区有一千七百多万亩遭受旱害，禾苗成长不好，七月下旬先后得雨，旱象已经解除。内蒙古自治区六月以来普遍缺雨，至六月底尚有百分之二十八的耕地因旱未下种，另有百分之二十七的耕地下种未出苗或出苗不到二成，各盟区农民与旱灾展开猛烈斗争，纷纷打井浇地，哲里木盟仅开鲁、通辽两地已打井一万多眼。最近内蒙东部已获透雨，全区旱象已不严重，农民正抢种晚秋作物。西北区宁夏、甘肃、陕西等省的部分地区七月初也很干旱，其中宁夏省盐池、同心、陶乐三县旱灾最重，秋田大部未下种，夏田百分之二十的禾苗被旱死，七月十三日以后落了三场透雨，当地农民正抢种晚庄稼，以备度过灾荒。西南的大部地区五六月间发生严重旱象，七月初连续落雨，情况已经好转，云南、四川、西康等省的龟裂稻田多已灌满雨水，稻秧已经复苏，旱地正加紧补种红薯、荞麦、四季豆等；贵州省桐梓、镇远等地七月九日、十日先后落雨，旱象已不严重，都匀县尚有部分高地雨量不足。
            江苏安徽浙江等省雨涝成灾当地政府积极领导排水抢救
    另有一些地区，如江苏、安徽、浙江、河南、平原、四川、云南等省的部分地区，七月中旬下雨过多，部分地区圩堤溃决，山洪暴发，共淹田三百余万亩。各地灾情发生后，当地人民政府立即组织农民紧急排水抢救，部分淹田已经脱险。苏南区农民在受灾后十余天内，已将一百二十万亩被淹田地绝大部分抢救出险，现仅剩下二十七万亩?田（已垦殖的芦苇地），因地势低洼，尚未脱水。皖南因山洪暴发，淹没田地六十余万亩，当地农民在人民政府的正确领导下，克服了悲观等待，及依赖救济等思想，积极进行排水抢救，仅芜湖、南陵、当涂等八县，即组织龙骨水车一万七千七百辆，动员男女民工七万余人，日夜轮班排水；已脱水的田地，农民正纷纷补插稻秧，南陵县农民在五天内就插了两万五千亩。皖南此次抢救内涝中，芜湖县易太圩的机器排水站发挥了很大作用，每分钟排水八万四千加仑，七月二十七日止，已将圩内三万亩稻田的积水全部排出。苏北、皖北、浙江、河南等地被淹一百余万亩，均已抢救了大部，仍在继续排水。平原省安阳、濮阳两专区因河堤溃决，淹田六十余万亩，现正排水抢救，并已堵好卫河决口。西南区云南、川北、川南、川西等省区的部分地区，七月十日前后暴雨成灾，冲毁堤堰，淹没田地六万余亩，各地人民政府已发动农民抢救补种。
    七月间几次降雨的同时，有些地区暴风挟雹，造成了灾害。河北省邯郸、邢台等专区雹灾严重，邢台专区有五十多万亩被冰雹打毁禾苗，其中有二十五万亩收成无望，必须进行改种。绥远、平原、山东等省七月间共有三十多万亩受雹灾。东北吉林、辽西、辽东、黑龙江四省七月间先后降雹打伤庄稼约一百一十余万亩。各地雹灾发生后，省或县人民政府均已组织慰问组，携带救济粮分赴灾区慰问，并组织农民进行了补种或改种。
            各种虫害仍不断发生蔓延
            各地农民正紧急进行除治
    由于上述雨水不调的情况，各种虫害也不断发生和蔓延，各地农民正紧急进行除治。河北、山东、皖北、苏北、新疆等省区的农民，扑灭了蔓延七百余万亩的夏蝗之后，现在又展开扑灭秋蝗的斗争。河北省已有三十四万亩发生秋蝗，以天津专区近海地带较为严重，中央人民政府已决定派飞机两架协助剿灭。秋蝗在山东、湖北等地也已零星发现。各地人民政府正发动群众查掘蝗卵，和捕打已经出土的秋蝻。
    棉花蚜虫各产棉区曾普遍发生：华北区有百分之七十的棉田受到蚜害；东北区辽西、辽东、热河三省有百分之六十的棉田发生蚜虫；山东省棉田普遍发生蚜虫；此外河南、湖北、江西、陕西、以及西南各地的棉田也均先后遭受蚜害。其中以河北、平原、山东较为严重，经这些地区的党政领导机关领导农民集中全力除治，目前棉蚜为害已经减轻了百分之五十到八十。中南、西北、西南各产棉区的蚜害，已经基本消灭。东北辽东省产棉区的蚜害已停止发展。红蜘蛛目前正在蔓延发展，河北省已有一百一十余万亩棉田发现红蜘蛛为害，山东、平原等地也已发生，各地农民正紧急除治。
    华东和中南水稻产区的螟虫，经各地农民大力捕捉，现已停止蔓延，仅浙江、福建、湖南三省，即动员了八百余万人，捕蛾五亿余只，采卵四千余万块。但目前正是第三代螟蛾孵化的时期，螟害的侵袭仍有可能。
    东北、华北等地区的杂粮产区，行军虫，夜盗虫曾大量发生，山东省德州专区行军虫为害特别严重。经各地农民大力捕捉，虫害已趋下降。辽东省的夜盗虫已全部消灭。目前正是行军虫变蛾产卵，孵化最快的时期，各地仍需严密注意，不断进行除治。
    由于气候失常，时旱时涝，而且虫害不断发生和蔓延，这一切对于农业生产形成了严重的威胁，各地农民曾战胜了春夏两季的自然灾害，赢得了小麦和早稻的丰收，但目前各种自然灾害的威胁仍然存在，各地党政领导机关都在密切注意旱涝虫雹等灾害的发生，正领导农民群众进行防范、抢救和除治虫害等工作。
                                            （申非）
