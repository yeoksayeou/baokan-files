　　"The Serious Problem is Educating the Peasants"
     - On Political Education Work for Peasants During the Cotton Selling and Storage Campaign in Hebei Province
        Li Dianlong
    The day after the Central Government issued instructions on purchasing and storing cotton, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Government issued a call to launch a patriotic cotton selling and storage campaign. The Hebei Provincial Committee also issued publicity instructions and publicity points on carrying out this campaign, pointing out the content, methods, and requirements of the publicity. It immediately organized party reporters, propagandists, and all party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and staff from cooperatives and banks in cotton-producing areas, and used newspapers, periodicals, and radio stations to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity work to cotton farmers, promoting the development of the cotton selling and storage campaign.

    In the practice of the cotton purchasing and storage campaign, everyone deeply felt that "the serious problem is educating the peasants." Peasants' awareness has improved in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, but in the cotton selling and storage campaign, many ideological problems arose due to their small-scale peasant economy's conservative thinking. The common and serious problems were: (1) Not selling cotton unless they need money, so-called: "Holding it in your arms is not as good as having it in your hands," "What parents have is not as good as what you have yourself." (2) Holding out for higher prices, namely: "The farmer's child is charming, the more expensive the less he sells," "Scarcity makes it valuable." (3) Some farmers were afraid of borrowing and donating. Therefore, raising the political awareness of cotton farmers and fully mobilizing them is the central link in carrying out cotton selling and storage work.

    However, there were two different approaches to cotton purchasing and storage in various parts of Hebei Province, and thus there were two different results.

    The correct approach was: to carry out huge publicity and education work, helping farmers realize that selling and storing cotton is a major matter related to the interests of the people of the whole country, the supply of clothing for the military and civilians of the whole country, price stability, and national economic construction and opposition to American imperialist aggression. Patiently and thoroughly carrying out patriotic publicity, and wherever this was done, the results of cotton selling and storage were good and successful.

    The content of this patriotic publicity started with cotton farmers becoming wealthy by growing cotton, extending to the worker-peasant alliance, urban-rural mutual assistance, consideration of both public and private interests, resisting America and aiding Korea, and consolidating national defense. It repeatedly explained to cotton farmers the relationship between protecting the country and becoming wealthy, industry and agriculture, textile workers and cotton farmers, as well as the responsibility of cotton farmers in the construction of the new China.

    In addition to relying on reporters and propagandists to carry out extensive publicity, publicity was also conducted through various forums (family heads forums, mother-in-law meetings, daughter-in-law meetings, cotton merchant meetings, trader meetings, etc.), recollection meetings (think-think meetings, comparison meetings, heart-to-heart talks), inspection of patriotic pacts, a letter-writing campaign, cotton collection publicity sheds, and mobilizing workers and farmers, and model workers in industry and agriculture to communicate with each other in newspapers.

    This publicity first solved the thinking of party members, members of the Communist Youth League, village cadres, labor models, and active elements among the masses; then they were relied upon to universally mobilize the masses. This approach had great effects. In educating the masses, it is also necessary to pay attention to the combination of general education and key in-depth work, and to effectively grasp key cotton-storing households and key people to carry out work. Key cotton-storing households are mostly well-to-do middle peasants before the land reform. These people store the most cotton and have the most concerns, often refusing to sell it all at once. Housewives and family heads are the key figures in farm households. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, women have actively participated in production and have gained political and economic status in society and the family, playing a certain role in the control of family property; at the same time, the traditional division of labor in peasant families is "men outside, women inside," and some women still retain a certain degree of the mentality of "He's not afraid of selling the mule, but he's worried about selling the cotton." Therefore, if women are not actively mobilized, cotton selling work will be hindered. However, merely solving the ideological problems of women, and the head of the household does not speak, the cotton will still not be sold. Therefore, it is necessary to grasp these objects and carry out vigorous publicity and education work.

    In addition, patriotic publicity and education work must also be carried out for private cotton merchants. These people must be patiently explained the policies and announced government decrees.

    When cotton farmers recalled: "Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government lowered the price of cotton, and cotton was so cheap that no one wanted it. People burned cotton bolls, cotton lint, and cotton stalks together as firewood"; "During the Japanese imperialist rule, cotton was forcibly requisitioned, searched door to door, smashing spinning wheels, and planting cotton was fearful"; "It's only been good to grow cotton in the past few years. The government has stipulated the cotton-grain price ratio, and one hundred catties of seed cotton can be exchanged for three hundred catties of rice; when something goes wrong, the government helps to cure it, and if there is no food, the government lends it to eat, and lends fertilizer, and lends waterwheels, and lends money to dig wells, and now selling and storing cotton is said to be a patriotic action"; "With the help of the People's Government, everyone's life has been greatly improved." The farmers also saw that the coal, iron, pots, bowls, alkali noodles, white sugar, fine cloth, sneakers, pesticides, flashlights...they used were all made by the working elder brothers. In the future, the elder brothers will also make tractors and weeding machines to improve agricultural production. Thinking of these things, many farmers said: "Those wearing straw hats (farmers) cannot live a day without those wielding iron hammers (workers)." "Thinking about the past, comparing it to the present, thinking about the front, and looking at the rear, it is right to ‘support’ the government with cotton." As a result, cotton farmers enthusiastically sold and stored cotton. Some people even sold the cotton they used to make quilts for their weddings and hand-spun cotton to the state. In particular, some cotton farmers sternly rejected private merchants who bought cotton with high-priced lures.

    Facts have proved that farmers' conservative thinking is not impossible to change. The question is whether the Party organization is good at unifying political tasks with economic tasks, national interests with the individual interests of cotton farmers, and long-term interests with current interests, and carrying out in-depth publicity and education work for cotton farmers.

    Another is the wrong approach. Basically, there is insufficient understanding of the cotton selling and storage work, thinking that it is a matter for the economic departments, and treating it as their own "extra burden." Under the guidance of this idea, some adopted methods of coercion, mandatory sales, and door-to-door searches to complete the task in their work. For example, saying: "Storing cotton and not selling it is like a little Chiang Kai-shek," "Keeping cotton is helping America," etc. In addition, some purely proceed from the individual interests of some cotton farmers and accommodate the wrong demands of cotton farmers. Some people have proposed that the state-owned company's purchase price of cotton should be increased, etc. These practices not only fail to complete the cotton selling and storage task, but instead fuel the tendency of some farmers to hide cotton and not sell it, or secretly sell it to private merchants, and have a negative impact on the promotion of cotton planting in the future. In the cotton purchasing and storage work in a village in Wu'an, they mistakenly encouraged farmers to sell cotton and hoard wheat. The cotton farmers said: "It's easy to sell cotton, but you have to bring good wheat." But when the good wheat was brought, the cotton farmers complained that the cotton price was too low. When the cotton price was raised, the cotton farmers complained that the "grading" personnel were not technically skilled and were afraid of being at a disadvantage. When more technically skilled "grading" personnel were transferred, the cotton farmers said: "There is no more cotton!" In fact, only half of it had been sold, and the other half was waiting for a higher price. Later, Commissioner Shi of Handan Prefecture went to the village to correct the bias of the work team, which only catered to the economic demands of the farmers and did not patiently carry out patriotic education. The cotton farmers then sold more than 60,000 catties of stored cotton to the state.

    This cotton selling and storage movement once again educated the Party's propaganda workers that they must patiently educate farmers in all work, enlighten farmers' class consciousness, and turn the state's tasks into the conscious actions of the masses.

　　“严重的问题是教育农民”
     记河北省售棉储棉运动中对农民的政治教育工作
        李殿隆
    在中央发布购棉储棉指示的第二天，中共河北省委及河北省人民政府即发出了开展爱国主义售棉储棉运动的号召。河北省委又发出了关于开展这一运动的宣传指示与宣传要点，指出了宣传内容、方法和要求。并且立即组织了产棉区党的报告员、宣传员及全体党员、团员和合作社、银行两个部门的工作人员，以及利用报纸刊物、广播电台向棉农展开了广泛的深入的宣传工作，推动了售棉储棉运动的展开。
    在购棉储棉运动的实践中，大家深切地体会到“严重的问题是教育农民”。农民在抗美援朝、镇压反革命运动中，觉悟都有所提高，但在售棉储棉运动中，由于他们的小农经济保守思想，发生了很多思想问题。普遍和严重的问题是：（一）不用钱花，就不卖棉花，所谓：“怀里揣着，不如手里拿着”，“爹有娘有不如自己有”。（二）看涨惜售，即：“庄稼人生的俏，越贵越不粜”，“以少为贵”。（三）部分农民怕借贷和怕捐献。因此，提高棉农的政治觉悟，把棉农充分发动起来，是开展售棉储棉工作的中心环节。
    但是河北省各地购棉储棉中，就有两种不同的作法，因而也就有两种结果。
    正确的作法是：进行巨大的宣传教育工作，帮助农民认识到售棉储棉是关系全国人民利益，关系全国军民衣着供应，物价稳定，以及国家经济建设和反对美帝国主义侵略的大事。耐心地深入地进行爱国主义宣传，凡是这样作的地区，售棉储棉的结果都是好的成功的。
    这种爱国主义宣传的内容，是从棉农种棉发家说起，引伸到工农联盟、城乡互助、公私兼顾、抗美援朝与巩固国防上来，反复的向棉农解释保国与发家、工业与农业、纺织工人与棉农的关系，以及棉农在新中国建设中的责任。
    除了依靠报告员、宣传员进行广泛宣传外，并通过各种座谈会（当家人座谈会、婆婆会、媳妇会、棉贩会、交易员会等）、回忆会（想想会、比比会、谈心会）、检查爱国公约、一封信运动、收棉宣传棚，并发动工人与农民，工农业劳动模范在报纸上互相通信等宣传方式进行宣传。
    这种宣传首先是解决党员、团员、村干部、劳动模范和群众中的积极分子的思想；然后依靠他们去普遍发动群众。这种作法效果甚大。在教育群众中又必须注意到一般教育和重点深入相结合，切实抓住存棉重点户和重点人进行工作。重点存棉户多系土地改革前的富裕中农。这些人存棉最多，顾虑最大，常常不肯一下卖光。家庭妇女和当家人是农户的重点人物。几年来妇女在党的领导下，积极参加生产，取得了社会和家庭中的政治、经济地位，对家庭财产起着一定的支配作用；同时历来的农民家庭分工是“男立外，女立内”，某些妇女还保存一定程度的“卖掉骡子他不怕，卖掉棉花就着急”的心理。因之，不积极发动妇女，售棉工作即会受到阻力。但仅仅是解决妇女的思想问题，而当家老人不说话，棉花还是不会卖的。因此必须抓住这些对象，进行有力的宣传教育工作。
    此外对私商棉贩也必须进行爱国主义的宣传教育工作。对这些人要耐心地讲解政策，宣布政府法令。
    当着棉农回忆到：“解放前国民党反动政府压价收棉，棉花贱的没人要，人们把棉桃棉绒和棉秸一起当柴烧”；“日本帝国主义统治时强征棉花，挨门搜查，砸破纺车，种棉是担惊受怕”；“这几年种棉花才好，政府规定了棉粮比价，一百斤籽棉能换三百斤米；出了毛病政府帮着治，没有粮食政府借给吃，又贷肥料，又贷水车，又贷款打井，现在卖棉储棉，又说是爱国行动”；“在人民政府的帮助下，大家的生活已大大提高”。农民又看到自己用的煤、铁、锅、碗、碱面、白糖、细布、球鞋、农药、手电……都是工人老大哥造的。将来老大哥还要造拖拉机、锄草机，改进农业生产。想到这些，很多农民这样说：“‘戴草帽’（农民）的一天也离不开‘抡铁锤’（工人）的。”“想想过去，比比现在，想想前方，看看后方，就是把棉花‘拥护’给政府也应该的。”因而棉农踊跃售棉储棉。有些人甚至把结婚时作被子用的棉花、手纺用花，也都卖给了国家。特别是有些棉农严词拒绝了以高价利诱购买棉花的私商。
    事实证明，农民的保守的思想，不是不可以改变的。问题是党的组织是不是善于将政治任务与经济任务，国家利益与棉农个人利益，长远利益与目前利益统一起来，向棉农进行深入的宣传教育工作。
    另一种是错误的作法。基本上是对售棉储棉工作认识不足，认为这是经济部门的事，把它当成自己的“额外负担”。在这种思想指导下，有的在工作中采用强迫命令、限期出卖、挨户搜查的方法来完成任务。例如说：“存棉不卖就是小蒋介石”，“放着棉花就是帮助美国”等等，另外也有的是单纯从某些棉农个人利益出发，迁就棉农的错误要求。有人就提出国营公司收购棉花的牌价应提高等等。这些作法，结果不但不能完成售储棉任务，反而助长了某些农民藏棉不卖，或者偷偷地卖给私商，并对今后推广种棉留下了不良影响。武安某村在购棉储棉工作中，就曾错误地鼓动农民卖棉囤麦。棉农说：“卖棉好说，你拿好麦子来”。可是等到好麦子运来了，棉农又嫌棉价低。棉价提升了，棉农又嫌“分级”人员技术低，怕分不好级吃亏。技术较高的“分级”人员调多了，棉农又说：“没有棉花了！”实际上只不过卖了一半，还有一半要等更大的价钱。后来邯郸专区石专员去该村，才纠正了工作组的这种只是迁就农民经济要求而不耐心进行爱国主义教育的偏向。棉农也才把六万多斤存棉卖给了国家。
    这次售棉储棉运动又一次教育了党的宣传工作人员，必须在一切工作中耐心地教育农民，启发农民的阶级觉悟，把国家的任务成为群众的自觉行动。
