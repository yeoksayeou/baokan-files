　　Finally Eliminate Feudal Remnant Forces in Industrial and Mining Enterprises
    Democratic Reform Movement Gradually Unfolds in Central and Southern China
    A large-scale democratic reform movement has been gradually unfolding in the Central and Southern China region for the past two months. The purpose of the movement is to finally eliminate feudal remnant forces in factories, mines, industries, and streets, paving the way for future production and construction. The development of the movement, in large and medium-sized cities, generally starts from factories and gradually expands to industries and streets; in small cities, it is carried out in conjunction with industries and streets. Democratic reform in factories and mining enterprises is carried out in three steps: first, launching democratic struggles against feudal remnant elements; second, strengthening democratic unity within the workforce; and third, rectifying organizations and establishing systems. In Wuhan, after forty-two larger factories achieved victory in the struggle against feudal remnants and entered the stage of strengthening democratic unity within the workforce, the movement has expanded to small and medium-sized factories and industries. In sixty key factories and industrial units in ten small and medium-sized cities in Henan Province, such as Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Luohe, and Zhoukou, forty units have already carried out democratic struggles against feudal remnants. In Guangzhou, more than twenty public and private factories have initially mobilized the masses of workers to carry out democratic struggles against feudal remnants; the dock workers on land and water have also achieved victory in key areas against feudal foremen and feudal monopolistic systems. Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces are also universally conducting typical experiments in democratic reform in key areas.
    The democratic reform movement in Central and Southern China is being carried out with leadership and order. Since the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee decided to launch the democratic reform movement in May this year, based on the demands of the working masses, the CPC committees of most provinces and cities in the region have successively convened urban work conferences and party representative conferences; most provincial and municipal trade unions have also successively convened expanded cadre meetings and worker representative conferences, conveying the decision of the Central China Bureau and formulating specific plans for carrying out the movement in light of the actual conditions of the region. The Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC and the Wuhan Municipal Committee also separately submitted proposals for carrying out the democratic reform movement to the joint meeting of the Henan Provincial People's Government Committee and the CPPCC Consultative Committee and to the Wuhan Municipal People's Representative Conference. After these meetings made resolutions, democratic reform committees were established with the CPC committees as the core to uniformly lead the movement. When carrying out the democratic reform movement, all localities first selected several areas and units with a better work foundation as key experiments, and concentrated cadres to form work groups and run short-term training courses to train worker activists as the backbone and core of the movement; responsible persons of the relevant leading departments also went deep into key areas and units to directly guide the development of the movement. In order to fully mobilize the masses of workers and people from all walks of life in the city to participate in and support the democratic reform movement, all localities widely publicized the principles, policies, and methods of the Communist Party and the People's Government on democratic reform in the early stage of the movement. Ten small and medium-sized cities in Henan Province convened municipal people's representative conferences, factory and industry worker representative conferences, and district and street people's representative conferences to publicize and explain policies, and organized a large number of propagandists and reporters to go deep into the masses to publicize and explain, in order to eliminate some unnecessary hesitation and concerns among the masses. Many workers who were initially afraid that they would not be able to defeat the feudal remnant forces actively participated in the movement with the connection of activists after the publicity and explanation. Through publicity, the uneasy emotions of industrialists and businessmen, owners, and landlords also stabilized. After understanding the policies, industrialists and businessmen in Zhengzhou also specifically convened a representative meeting of industrialists and businessmen, deciding to support and participate in the democratic reform movement, completely isolating the feudal remnant elements and promoting the smooth development of the movement.
    In the early stage of the movement, some cadres believed that after the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, the problems in the city were no longer significant. In fact, taking Henan Province, where the work was relatively good, as an example, although the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries had achieved great results, the so-called "Ten Evils" and "Thirty-Six Friends" and other feudal remnant elements still secretly controlled factories and industries. Before the democratic reform in Xuchang, the grassroots organizations in the streets occupied or manipulated by feudal remnant elements accounted for 50 percent. In the Guangzhou port industry, where the masses were fully mobilized in the three major movements, although some counter-revolutionary elements had been cleared out and the serious exploitation situation of "seven-three distribution" (foremen get 70 percent, workers get 30 percent) had been changed, the feudal foremen still colluded with counter-revolutionary elements, secretly suppressed workers, and established a separate "dry share system" (i.e., feudal foremen gained without labor), making the dock workers still live in poverty. The exposure of these cases overcame the complacency and complacency of the cadres, making them realize that democratic reform was not only required by the people, but also necessary for developing production and consolidating the people's democratic regime.
    Some cadres also worried that democratic reform would affect production and the unity within the workers. Facts have proved that this worry is also unfounded. In many factories and industries in Wuhan and Henan Province that have successfully completed the anti-feudal struggle, the feudal foreman system and feudal control system have been abolished, and the workers have truly established the idea and labor attitude of being masters, and their enthusiasm for unity and production has been unprecedentedly high. More than 97 percent of the workers in the Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill and Yuhua Cotton Mill have put forward suggestions and guarantees for improving production in this movement. After the feudal remnant forces were defeated in the Jiang'an Locomotive Depot in Hankou, the number of groups participating in the production competition quickly increased from 25 to 38, and new records and rationalization proposals in production continued to emerge. In the democratic reform movement in the Pulin Power Plant in Kaifeng, Henan Province, due to the workers' active protection of production safety, responsibility accidents dropped sharply from 28 in the first quarter to 2. In many small and medium-sized cities in Henan Province, after the conspiracy of feudal foremen to create sectarian struggles was exposed, the workers have become unprecedentedly united internally and have universally launched patriotic labor competitions.

　　最后肃清工矿行业中的封建残余势力
    中南区民主改革运动逐步展开
    一个大规模的民主改革运动两个月来正在中南地区逐步展开。运动的目的是最后肃清工厂、矿山、行业、街道中的封建残余势力，为今后的生产建设铺平道路。运动的发展，在大、中城市中，一般是由工厂开始，逐步扩展到行业和街道；在小城市中，是行业与街道结合进行。厂矿企业单位中的民主改革，分为三个步骤进行，即第一步发动反对封建残余分子的民主斗争，第二步加强职工内部的民主团结，第三步整顿组织，建立制度。武汉市在四十二个较大工厂取得反对封建残余斗争的胜利进入加强职工内部民主团结的阶段后，运动已发展到中小工厂和行业中。河南省开封、郑州、洛阳、漯河、周口等十个中小城市六十个重点工厂、行业单位中，已有四十个单位进行了反对封建残余的民主斗争。广州市已有二十多个公、私营工厂初步发动工人群众进行了反对封建残余的民主斗争；水陆码头的搬运工人方面也在重点区取得了反对封建把头和封建把持制度的胜利。湖北、江西、湖南、广东、广西五省也都普遍地在重点地区进行民主改革的典型试验。
    中南区的民主改革运动是有领导有秩序地开展的。自今年五月中共中央中南局城市工作会议根据工人群众的要求，决定开展民主改革运动后，两个月来，全区大部分省、市的中共党委会都先后召开了城市工作会议和党员代表大会；大部分省、市总工会也都先后召开了扩大干部会议和工人代表大会，传达了中南局的决定，同时联系本地区的实际情况，制定了开展运动的具体计划。中共河南省委员会和武汉市委员会还分别向该省人民政府委员会暨各界人民代表会议协商委员会联席会议和该市各界人民代表会议提出开展民主改革运动的建议，经这些会议作出决议，成立以中共党委会为核心的民主改革委员会，统一领导运动的进行。各地在开展民主改革运动时都首先选择了若干工作基础较好的地区、单位作重点试验，并集中干部组成工作组和举办短期训练班，训练工人积极分子作为运动中的骨干和核心；各有关领导部门的负责人员也深入重点地区、单位，直接指导运动的开展。为了充分发动工人群众以及城市各阶层人民参加和支持民主改革运动，各地在运动初期都曾广泛宣传了共产党和人民政府关于民主改革的方针、政策和办法。河南省十个中小城市曾召开市各界人民代表会议，工厂、行业职工代表会议和区、街人民代表会议宣传解释政策，并组织大批宣传员、报告员深入群众宣传解释，以消除群众中某些不必要的犹疑和顾虑。许多起初怕斗不倒封建残余势力的工人经过宣传解释后，在积极分子的串连下，积极参加了这一运动。经过宣传，工商业者、业主、房主们的不安情绪也稳定下来。郑州市工商业者在了解了政策后，还专门召开了工商业者代表会议，决定赞助和参加民主改革运动，使封建残余分子完全孤立，运动顺利地发展。
    运动初期，部分干部认为：经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革三大运动之后，城市中的问题已经不大。实际上，以工作较好的河南省为例：镇压反革命工作虽有很大成绩，但所谓“十大恶”、“三十六友”等封建残余分子却仍然暗中把持着工厂和行业。许昌市在民主改革前，街道基层组织被封建残余分子占据或操纵的竟占百分之五十。在三大运动中群众发动较充分的广州市码头行业内，虽然清除了一些反革命分子并改变了“七三分账”（把头分七成、工人分三成）的严重剥削情况，但封建把头分子仍然勾结反革命分子，暗中压制工人，另立“干份制”（即封建把头不劳而获），使搬运工人仍处于贫苦的生活中。这些事例的揭发，克服了干部中的麻痹思想和自满情绪，使他们认识到民主改革不但为人民群众所要求，也是发展生产、巩固人民民主政权所必需。
    某些干部也曾顾虑民主改革会影响生产、影响工人内部的团结，事实证明这种顾虑也是没有根据的。武汉市和河南省许多已经胜利完成反封建斗争的工厂、行业里，封建头佬制和封建把持制已经废除，工人已真正的树立了主人翁的思想和劳动态度，团结生产的热情空前高涨。武汉市第一纱厂和裕华纱厂百分之九十七以上的职工，都在这次运动中提出了改进生产的意见和保证。汉口江岸机务段在打垮封建残余势力后，参加生产竞赛的小组迅即由二十五组增加到三十八组，生产中的新纪录和合理化建议不断涌现。河南省开封普临电厂在民主改革运动中，由于工人积极保卫生产安全，责任事故由第一季度的二十八次骤减至两次。河南省许多中小城市中的搬运工人，在封建把头制造宗派斗争的阴谋被揭穿后，内部已空前团结起来，并普遍展开了爱国劳动竞赛。
