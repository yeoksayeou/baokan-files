　　The Trend of Plagiarism Must Not Be Encouraged
        Ren Yun, Li Ming
    After reading the book "From the May Fourth Movement to the Birth of the People's Republic of China" published by Xinchao Bookstore, I believe it is necessary to expose the serious plagiarism of the book's authors. The book is nominally co-edited by Wu Min and Xiao Feng, but in fact, except for a small part at the end of the book and a few other isolated places, it is completely plagiarized from Tian Jiaying's "Chronicle of Major Events Since the Republic of China," Xinhua Bookstore's "From July 7th to August 15th," and Xinhua News Agency's "Who Should Be Held Responsible for the War?" Only in some places have individual words and the order of the preceding and following been changed. It is not an exaggeration to say that "From the May Fourth Movement to the Birth of the People's Republic of China" is basically a compilation of these three books. In principle, the bookstore and the editors should have made some explanation of this situation in the book when it was published, but not only did they not do so, but they also specifically stated in the preface that the book was compiled by the editors based on materials from more than thirty books, magazines, and newspapers. The first three books, like other books, are only regarded as general "references," and they criticize these books for lacking "accurate historical facts" and having many "errors," in order to show that this book is the result of careful research by the editors. This attitude is obviously very dishonest. We believe that this method of stealing other people's work results is extremely undesirable and should not be allowed to spread in the writing community.
          Editor's Note: After the publication of the article "Criticizing Speculative Publications of Speculative Publishers," readers have written letters expressing their support for our criticism of Xinchao Bookstore and making further exposures. What is published here is selected from these readers' contributions and letters. They all used concrete materials to illustrate the current confusion in the publishing industry to a certain extent. We believe that the opinions put forward by Comrade Xu Zongyi are correct, and the publishing administrative organs should take appropriate measures to restrict the activities of speculative publishers and rectify the publishing ranks. Only in this way can the power of the publishing industry be used properly, and more excellent reading materials can be provided to the vast number of enthusiastic learners.

　　抄袭之风不可长
        任云　李明
    我看了新潮书店出版的《从“五四”到中华人民共和国的诞生》一书，我认为必须揭发该书作者的严重的抄袭行为，该书名义上是由吴民、萧枫两人合编，但实际上除该书末尾一小部分及其他极个别的地方以外，完全是抄自田家英编《民国以来大事年表》、新华书店出版的《从七七到八一五》及新华社编辑的《什么人应负战争责任？》三书，只是在有些地方作了个别字句及前后次序的变更。说《从“五四”到中华人民共和国的诞生》一书基本上是这三本书的合编本，是并不过分的。按理书店和编者在出版这本书时，是应该在书中对这种情形有所说明的，但他们不但未这样作，反而在前言中特别声明这本书是由编者根据三十多种图书、杂志、报纸的材料编成的，前三书也与其他书一样只是当作一般的“参考”，并批评这些书都缺乏“史实的确切”，很多“错乱”，以表示这本书是编者精心研究的结果。这种态度显然是很不老实的。我们认为这种偷窃别人的工作成果的办法是极端要不得的，不应该让这种作风在著作界流传下去。
          编者按：《评投机出版商的投机出版物》一文发表以后，读者纷纷来信表示赞成我们对于新潮书店的批评，并作了进一步的揭发。这里所发表的是从这些读者来稿和来信中选出来的。他们都以具体的材料说明了目前出版界存在着一定程度的混乱现象。我们认为读者许宗义同志所提出意见是正确的，出版行政机关应当采取适当办法限制投机出版商的活动，整顿出版界的队伍。只有这样，才能使出版界的力量运用得当，并以更多的优秀读物供给广大的热情学习的读者。
