　　Gradually Organize Scattered Handicraft Workers!
　　National Cooperative First Handicraft Production Work Conference
　　Decides on Future Development Policy for Handicraft Production Cooperatives

　　The national handicraft production cooperative undertaking has already achieved considerable scale. According to statistics from the National Cooperative First Handicraft Production Work Conference held in Beijing from June 6th to June 26th, in 1950, the country had 1,300 production cooperatives with 260,000 members and 15.1 billion in share capital. These cooperatives were engaged in the production of textiles, knitwear, food processing, agricultural tool manufacturing, clothing and footwear, daily necessities manufacturing, and small-scale mining. Some of these handicraft production cooperatives have established economic accounting systems, technical management systems, relatively reasonable wage systems, and formulated labor covenants, organized production competitions, thereby improving product quality and output, reducing production costs, accumulating production funds, improving production, and organizing cultural and welfare undertakings. However, at the same time, because the leading organs of cooperatives in various regions have not paid enough attention to the organization of handicraft production cooperatives, there is no unified understanding of the development direction and policies of handicraft production cooperatives, and cadres also lack experience, many handicraft production cooperatives have not yet gotten on the right track.

　　Handicraft production occupies a non-negligible proportion in the current national economic composition of our country, and it is still developing. According to statistics from Zhejiang Province, in 1950, agriculture accounted for 72% of the province's total output value, modern industry accounted for 9.5%, and handicrafts accounted for 18.5%. It is estimated that the total output value of handicraft production will increase to more than four times that of 1949 this year. The reason is that with the completion of land reform, the exchange between urban and rural areas has expanded, the purchasing power of farmers has rapidly increased, and the demand of farmers for industrial products has greatly increased, while the speed of modern industrial production cannot keep up with the growth of farmers' purchasing power for the time being. Therefore, developing handicrafts, using handicrafts to exchange for agricultural products, so as to reduce the widening of the price scissors between industrial and agricultural products and maintain the production enthusiasm of farmers, is an important issue that needs to be resolved urgently.

　　Based on the above situation, the representatives attending the National Cooperative Handicraft Production Work Conference unanimously agreed that: we must attach importance to the handicraft production cooperative undertaking; only by organizing scattered handicraft workers, collectively purchasing raw materials and selling finished products, and avoiding intermediate exploitation, can we gradually transform backward small production into advanced large production; and only by organizing can we easily obtain state assistance. However, due to insufficient cadres, technical conditions and work experience, the development of handicraft production cooperatives should be carried out steadily at present. Existing handicraft production cooperatives should be consolidated and experiences summarized; areas where handicraft production cooperatives have not been established should immediately conduct pilot projects with emphasis.

　　In order to avoid repeating past shortcomings, the conference decided that the guiding principles for the future development of handicraft production cooperatives are:

　　1. In the past, most handicraft production cooperatives were formed to solve the living difficulties of unemployed workers in large and medium-sized cities, so the work was passive and there were many difficulties; in the future, the focus of work should be on organizing independent small handicraft workers and family handicraft workers in small and medium-sized towns and rural areas.

　　2. The current task of handicraft production cooperatives is to organize supply and marketing businesses, develop production through supply and marketing businesses, and should not organize collective production and machine production too early. But there was also such a bias in the past, with some handicraft production cooperatives remaining in the supply and marketing business stage for a long time without organizing collective production and improving production tools. In order to ensure that handicraft production cooperatives can get on the right track in the future, the conference stipulated that the goals of handicraft production cooperatives are: 1. Unify supply and marketing businesses; 2. Unify calculation of profits and losses, and distribute surpluses according to the amount of labor of the members; 3. Unify product specifications; 4. Unify quantitative standards for raw materials and finished products, and implement a system of members delivering goods on schedule; 5. Unify piece-rate wage standards and payment methods.

　　In addition, the conference also drafted a draft of the articles of association for handicraft production cooperatives and submitted it to various regions for trial implementation.

　　把分散的手工业者逐步组织起来！
    全国合作社第一次手工业生产工作会议
    决定今后手工业生产合作社发展方针
    全国手工业生产合作事业已具相当规模。据六月六日到六月二十六日在北京举行的全国合作社第一次手工业生产工作会议统计，一九五零年全国有生产合作社一千三百个，社员二十六万人，股金一百五十一亿。这些合作社经营的生产事业有纺织、针织、食品加工、农具制造、服装制鞋、日用品制造和小型矿产等。这些手工业生产合作社有的已经建立了经济核算制度、技术管理制度、较合理的工资制度，并订立了劳动公约，组织了生产竞赛，因而提高了产品的质量和产量，降低了生产成本，积累了生产资金，改进了生产，举办了文化福利事业。但同时由于各地合作社的领导机关对于组织手工业生产合作社还不够重视，对于手工业生产合作社的发展方针、政策认识不统一，干部经验也还不够，因而也有许多手工业生产合作社还没有走上正轨。
    手工业生产在目前我国国民经济成份中占着不可忽视的比重，而且它还正在发展着。据浙江省的统计，一九五零年全省生产总值中，农业占百分之七十二，近代化的工业占百分之九点五，手工业占百分之十八点五。手工业生产总值今年估计将增加为一九四九年的四倍以上。原因是土地改革完成，城乡交流扩大，农民购买力迅速提高，农民对工业品的要求大大增加，而近代化工业生产的速度一时还赶不上农民购买力的增长。因此，发展手工业，用手工业品交换农产品，以减少工农产品剪刀差价的扩大，保持农民的生产积极性，是当前急待解决的重要问题。
    根据上述情况，全国合作社手工业生产工作会议到会代表一致认为：必须重视手工业生产合作事业；只有把分散的手工业者组织起来，集体购买原料和推销成品，避免中间剥削，才能逐渐地改造落后的小生产成为先进的大生产；也只有组织起来，才容易获得国家扶助。但是，由于干部、技术条件和工作经验不足，目前发展手工业生产合作社应当稳步进行。已有的手工业生产合作社应加以巩固，总结经验；未成立手工业生产合作社的地区，应立即有重点地试办。
    为了避免重复过去的缺点，会议决定今后发展手工业生产合作社的方针是：
    一、过去大多数手工业生产合作社是为了解决大、中城市失业工人的生活困难而组成，因此工作被动，困难很多；今后应把工作重点放在组织中、小城镇和农村中的独立小手工业者和家庭手工业者上面。
    二、手工业生产合作社的当前任务是组织供销业务，通过供销业务发展生产，不应过早地组织集体生产和机器生产。但过去也有这样的偏向，有的手工业生产合作社长期停留在供销业务阶段，不去组织集体生产和改进生产工具。为了保证今后手工业生产合作社能走上正轨，会议规定了手工业生产合作社的努力目标是：一、统一供销业务；二、统一计算盈亏，盈余按社员劳动的多少来分配；三、统一产品规格；四、统一原料、成品的定量标准，实行社员按期交货责任制；五、统一计件工资标准和支付办法。
    此外，会议还草拟了手工业生产合作社章程准则草案，交各地试行。
