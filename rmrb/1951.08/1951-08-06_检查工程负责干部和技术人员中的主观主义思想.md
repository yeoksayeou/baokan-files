　　Examining Subjectivism Among Engineering Responsible Cadres and Technical Personnel
　　Technician, Agricultural Improvement Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture, Wu Jingfang
　　From the newspapers, we see that many projects have failed in basic construction across various regions. A series of facts seriously suggests to us that this is not an isolated phenomenon, but a concrete reflection of an ideological problem. If we take all these facts and carefully analyze them, we will find a common and fundamental root cause of failure: a lack of understanding of the surrounding environment, no investigation and research, and a failure to humbly listen to and analyze the opinions of the masses, leading to the partial or complete failure of projects, causing enormous losses to the people.

　　What does it mean to not understand the surrounding environment, to not conduct investigation and research, and to not listen to and analyze the opinions of the masses? It means subjectivism.

　　Subjectivism exists not only in the minds of technical personnel, but some engineering supervisors also have the same problem. Moreover, in terms of the degree to which it has an effect, the subjectivism of engineering supervisors is more harmful than that of technical personnel. Because if the principles and planning of a project are wrong, then no matter how skilled the technical personnel are, the result will not be of much significance. But this does not mean that in failed projects, technical personnel can push the responsibility upwards without deeply examining themselves. Rather, it means they have a greater responsibility to use all their abilities to provide administrative leaders with positive and correct suggestions, and strive for their adoption, in order to better fulfill the mission entrusted to them by the people.

　　Facts prove that subjectivism is a major obstacle on the path of construction of our new China, and has caused us great losses. In order to be responsible to the people, responsible for the national wealth accumulated by the sweat and blood of the working people, and to enable the country's construction work to advance steadily in victory, comrades standing in this position should ruthlessly expose it and deeply criticize it.

　　Now, let's start by analyzing the subjectivist thinking of engineering leaders and technical personnel with some concrete facts:

　　The subjectivism committed by engineering leaders generally comes in three forms: The first is failing to understand the project and making arbitrary decisions. For example, in the case of the housing problem of a certain cadre school mentioned by architects Dai Nianci and others, the engineering leader initially did not adopt the designer's suggestions regarding the ground issues, and later, on the basis of a "leader's decision," ordered the designer to add another floor to the completed building. The second is paying attention only to the project itself or its external aspects, and not paying attention to the connection between the project and the external environment, and its fundamental problems. They often harbor a mindset of making do and hoping for the best, deceiving themselves with "it might not be a problem" and defending themselves with "there's no time." This problem is so prevalent that it accounts for more than half of the twenty-six failed projects listed by engineer Zhan Jiagong. The third is planning too big and being too impatient. These people tend to be fond of grandiose schemes, relying solely on their own enthusiasm, without asking about objective needs or considering what subjective conditions are in place, preferring to decide issues within their own realm of fantasy. For example, the Sanggan River Silt Irrigation (Note 1) project, at that time, there was not enough theory and experience in silt irrigation, and cadres also felt lacking, but all of a sudden it was planned to build a large-scale project of 500,000 mu, and it was planned to be completed and silt irrigation to begin within one year. In the autumn of 1949, the route of the canal was decided before there was even time to survey the terrain. In the spring of 1950, the project was contracted to five private construction companies (earthwork not included). More than 190 buildings were completed in two phases, with more than 90 starting construction simultaneously in each phase. Some supervisors had to take care of two or three buildings, and the buildings were one or two kilometers apart from each other. The phenomenon of contractors cutting corners was very common. Therefore, this spring, 90% of the buildings had different degrees of problems. Before the water was released, repairs were made again. The entire project was completed in 1950, but this year it can only irrigate 150,000 mu. As for when it will be able to irrigate 500,000 mu, there is no certainty. The reasons are: 1. They dare not release the planned amount of water (the reasons are explained below). 2. The local labor force is lacking, and the task of completing the branch canals (Note 2) cannot be accomplished all at once. 3. The masses do not understand silt irrigation enough and have ideological concerns. 4. There is a lack of management cadres, and even more so a lack of complete and scientific silt irrigation methods. 5. Lack of a drainage system. Among these five reasons, don't three of them tell us that the subjective plan exceeded reality? Wouldn't it be better if we set the plan smaller and then developed appropriately after the above conditions are in place? Moreover, the terrain was not measured during the design, so the branch canal lines were not suitable and the location of the sluice gates was also inappropriate. In addition to the technical personnel being responsible for improper design, is it also because the leaders did not give them enough time? Doesn't this tell us that the leaders were too impatient?

　　The subjectivism committed by technical personnel also generally comes in three forms: First, dogmatism, manifested as "a flip through the books, everything is simple, without asking about the objective environment, a complete set of formulas is simply moved in." For example, the ground of the Sanggan River irrigation area is alkaline, and the soil quality is extremely poor; but the side slope of the canal is also the so-called "commonly used" "one to one point five" (Note 3). After completion, the original plan was to release water to a depth of 2.3 meters, but when it was released to more than one meter, there was a danger of collapse. This is the fundamental reason why the original 500,000 mu irrigation plan was not completed with certainty. Second, empiricism: These people are satisfied with a smattering of knowledge, unwilling to accept new things, and not good at elevating their experience to theory, so in their work, they are stubborn, have little improvement, and often miss important things. Now I will only give a very simple example, such as concrete solidifying slower in colder weather than in warmer weather, so the model template should also be removed later, but someone once said: "Where are all these picky things, I never differentiate between cold and hot, and I've never had one collapse!" Indeed, it won't collapse immediately, but its strength and lifespan will be affected. Third, let's call it "technical personnel looking down on each other," because this kind of thinking is similar to the ancient saying "scholars looking down on each other," although there are very few people with this problem, it is also necessary to point it out. These people feel that their technology is a sacred and inviolable thing, and do not consider or accept any opinions different from their own, because they think that it is a sign of doubt about their technology and disrespect for the dignity of their engineer; even if they think your opinion is correct, they still do not accept it, and they will say to you: "I am responsible if I do it wrong!" In reality, this is an extremely irresponsible attitude towards the people. Taking the Sanggan River project as an example, three branch canals can be merged into two. But why were three opened? It is because during the measurement, you measured yours and I measured mine, without interfering with each other, you said your opinion was good, and I said my opinion was not bad either.

　　It is precisely these bad habits of the old society and the individualistic ideological problems of petty-bourgeois intellectuals that entangle certain technical workers, limit them, and cause them to commit various forms of subjectivist errors in their thinking and style, so they have not completed the major tasks assigned to them by the people, forming a phenomenon of irresponsibility towards the people. Therefore, we can see that the "purely technical viewpoint" divorced from the political foundation and the "purely engineering viewpoint" that loses contact with the masses are not only incorrect, but also extremely harmful. Technology must be combined with politics, and technical personnel must also strive to improve their political level, this is undoubtedly the case.

　　Therefore, I think the State Council's decision on a universal inspection of basic construction is very correct. Any relevant department should seriously and thoroughly inspect its work once; through this inspection, everyone should improve a step ideologically.

　　(Note 1) Silt irrigation: is an irrigation method that causes river water carrying sediment to flow to low-lying areas, where the sediment settles, turning the depression into flat land.
　　(Note 2) Branch canals: the smallest canals used for irrigation.
　　(Note 3) One to one point five refers to the ratio of the height and width of the side slope.

　　检查工程负责干部和技术人员中的主观主义思想
    中央农业部农田水利局技术员  吴静方
    从报纸上，我们看到在基本建设中各地已有很多工程失败了。一连串的事实，严肃地提示我们：这不是个别现象，而是一种思想毛病的具体反映。我们把所有的那些事实拿来仔细分析一下，会发现其中有一种共同的而且是基本的失败根源。就是：对周围的环境不了解，没有调查研究，又不虚心倾听和分析群众的意见，以致工程部分或全部失败，造成人民的巨大损失。
    不了解周围环境，没有调查研究，又不倾听和分析群众的意见，这是什么意思呢？这就是主观主义。
    主观主义不仅存在于技术人员的思想中，某些工程负责者也有同样的毛病。而且在起作用的大小上说，工程负责者的主观主义比技术人员的主观主义更为有害。因为如果一个工程的原则和规划是错误的，那么无论技术人员的技术如何高明，其结果也不会有多大意义。但这并不是说在失败的工程中，技术人员都可以把责任往上一推，不必深刻的检查自己，而是说明他更有责任尽自己的一切能力给行政负责同志提供积极的和正确的建议，并争取其采纳，以便更完善的完成人民所赋予他的使命。
    事实证明：主观主义是我们新中国建设道路上的一个大障碍，并已使我们受到了很大损失。我们为了对人民负责，对劳动人民血汗积累起来的国家财富负责，使国家的建设工作在胜利中稳步前进，站在这个工作岗位上的同志们，应该无情地揭发它，深刻地批判它。
    现在我们不妨先拿些具体事实来把工程负责者和技术人员的主观主义思想分析一下：
    工程负责者所犯的主观主义大致有三种：第一种是不了解工程，擅自决定。如戴念慈等三位建筑师所举的某干部学校房屋问题的例子，该工程负责者起初不采纳设计者关于地面问题的建议，后来又以“首长决定”叫设计者在盖好的房子上再加一层。第二种是只注意工程本身或外表部分，不注意工程与外部环境的联系，及其基础问题。他们常抱着凑合和侥幸的心理，以“可能没问题吧”来欺骗自己，以“时间来不及”给自己辩护。这种毛病是这样的普遍，以致占陈家珖工程师所列举二十六件失败工程中超过一半的比例。第三种是计划过大，操之又急。这种人往往是好大喜功的，单凭自己的热情，不问客观的需要，不考虑具备了何种主观条件，好在自己空想的圈子里决定问题。例如桑乾河淤灌（注一）工程，当时对淤灌还没有足够的理论与经验，干部也感缺乏，但一下子就计划建筑五十万亩的大型工程，并打算在一年以内全部完成，开始淤灌。一九四九年秋连地形都没来得及测量就定了渠线。一九五○年春把工程包给五家私营建筑公司（土方工程不包括在内）。一百九十多个建筑物分两期完成，每期九十多个同时开工。有的监工要照顾两三个建筑物，建筑物彼此的距离又都有一、二公里之远。包商偷工减料的现象非常普遍。所以，今春百分之九十的建筑物都发生了大小不同的毛病。在放水之前，又补修了一次。全部工程在一九五○年完成，但今年却只能淤灌十五万亩。至于什么时候能淤灌到五十万亩，并无把握。原因是：一、不敢放到计划水量（原因以下有说明）。二、当地劳动力缺乏，一下子完成不了斗毛渠（注二）的任务。三、群众对淤灌还不够了解，思想上有顾虑。四、管理干部缺乏，更缺乏完整的与科学的淤灌办法。五、缺乏排水系统。这五条中间，三种原因是不是告诉我们主观计划超过了现实呢？如果我们把计划定得小一些，等到具备了上述条件再适当地向前发展不好吗？而且设计时没测量地形，因而支渠线走的不够恰当，斗门位置也不合适。这些，除去技术人员应负设计不当的责任以外，是不是也因为领导者没有给他们以够用的时间所致？这是不是告诉我们领导者操之过急了呢？
    技术人员所犯的主观主义，大致也有三种：第一，教条主义，表现为“书本一翻，事事简单，不问客观环境，整套的公式一搬”。例如桑乾河淤灌区地面翻碱，土质极坏；但渠道的边坡也是所谓“普通可采用”的“一比一点五”（注三）。完工以后，原计划放水深二公尺三，但放到一公尺以上，就有坍塌的危险。这是原来五十万亩淤灌计划没有把握完成的根本原因。第二，经验主义：这种人，满足于一知半解，不肯接受新鲜事物，不善于把自己的经验提升为理论，因而在工作中，表现固执，少有改进，而且常会误了大事。现在我只举一个很简单的例子，如混凝土在天气较冷的时期比在天气较热的时期凝结较慢，所以揭模型模板也应较晚，但就曾有人说：“哪儿那些穷讲究，我从来不分什么冷呀热的，也没坍过一个！”的确它不会马上就坍，但它的坚固性与寿命却是要受影响的。第三，叫它“技术人员相轻”吧，因为这种思想与古语“文人相轻”差不多，虽然有这种毛病的人是极少数，但也有指出来的必要。这种人觉得自己的技术是一种神圣不可侵犯的东西，不考虑也不接受任何与他不同的意见，因为他认为那是对他的技术表示怀疑，对他工程师的面子不尊重；即使你的意见他觉得是正确的，他也还是不接受，他会对你说：“做错了我负责！”实际上这是对人民极不负责的态度。还以桑乾河工程为例，其中有三条支渠可以合并为两条。但又为什么开了三条呢？就是因为在测量的时候，你测你的，我测我的，互不干涉，你说你的意见好，我说我的意见也不错。
    正是这些旧社会的不良习气和小资产阶级知识分子那种个人主义的思想毛病，缠绕着某些技术工作者，限制了他们，使他们在思想上和作风上犯了各种形式的主观主义的错误，因而他们没有完成人民所交给他们的重大任务，形成了对人民不负责任的现象。因此，我们可以看出脱离了政治基础的“单纯技术观点”及与群众失掉联系的“单纯工程观点”，不但是不正确的，而且是一种极有害的东西。技术必须与政治结合，技术人员也必须努力提高自己的政治水平，这是无疑的了。
    因此，我认为政务院关于普遍检查基本建设的决定是非常正确的。任何有关部门，都应该认真地、彻底地把自己的工作检查一遍；通过这次检查，使每个人都从思想上提高一步。
    （注一）淤灌：是一种使带泥沙的河水流于低洼之处，泥沙下沉，变洼地为平地的灌溉法。
    （注二）斗毛渠：作灌溉用的最小的水渠。
    （注三）一比一点五指边坡的高度和宽度的比例。
