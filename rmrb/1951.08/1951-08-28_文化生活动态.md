　　*“Language Teaching” Launched*
　　The inaugural issue of "Language Teaching" was published on August 15th. This is a journal dedicated to the study of language teaching. The journal primarily serves middle school teachers (with some attention to elementary school language instruction). Its purpose is to systematically assist middle school language teachers in resolving problems in language teaching, provide teaching reference materials, research teaching methods, and promptly summarize and promote language teaching experiences, gradually improving the teaching abilities of language teachers. The publication of this journal is of great help to language teachers and comrades who study language. The inaugural issue reprinted the editorial from this newspaper, "Correctly use the motherland's language and fight for the purity and health of the language!" and published Lu Shuxiang's "On the Classification of Words," which analyzes the most debated classification of words over the past twenty years, telling readers that the classification of words is not the entire content of grammar, and for those who study grammar for practical purposes, it is a relatively unimportant part of grammar. This article also explains the nature of the first lecture of "Talks on Grammar and Rhetoric" serialized in this newspaper. Li Jinxi's article "Middle Schools Should Systematically Teach Grammar" explains that teachers must fully grasp systematic grammatical knowledge and also fully grasp a planned, step-by-step, and focused grammar tutorial to do a good job in guiding students in grammar. Xing Gongwan's article "Is Chinese a Backward and Ungrammatical Language?" criticizes some scholars, artists, and literary reformers who have lost confidence, believing that the Chinese language is backward, poor, and ungrammatical. In addition, there are Ren Mingshan's "Marxist Linguistics and Problems in Chinese Language Teaching," Zhang Meian's "Rhetoric Talks" (serialized), and Sun Fuyuan's *Nahan* Essays – “The Storm,” and other articles.
　　*Health Departments Nationwide Vigorously Carry Out Health Education Work*
　　In order to implement the policy of prevention first, health departments across the country, in conjunction with the Central Maternal and Child Health Work Team, the Epidemic Prevention Team, and local mass organizations, are vigorously carrying out epidemic prevention, vaccination, and strengthening health education in schools, among other health education efforts. The publicity methods mostly adopt mobile exhibitions, combined with slides, movies, seminars, broadcasts, and informal talks. Some areas also assist residents' groups in establishing health administration teams; launching health competitions, formulating health covenants, or taking advantage of the intensive training of primary school teachers to impart knowledge and techniques for vaccination and epidemic prevention. For example, middle and primary schools in thirteen major cities in Northeast China, such as Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian, have held health lectures and health wall newspapers to carry out mass health campaigns. The Jilin Health Bureau also convened relevant agencies and mass organizations to form a BCG Promotion Committee, planning to complete the experiment and vaccination of 49,736 children in August. Shanghai mobilized more than 2,000 practicing Western medicine doctors and 1,000 traditional Chinese medicine doctors who had undergone short-term training to participate in the summer epidemic prevention campaign. Because Harbin's publicity work has been done well, 670,000 people were vaccinated this spring, accounting for 84 percent of the city's population. In the suburbs of Guangzhou, 95.5 percent of the population was inoculated against cholera.

    《语文教学》创刊
    《语文教学》创刊号已于八月十五日出版。这是一种研究语文教学的期刊。该刊以中学教师为主要服务对象（部分照顾到小学国语教学）。目的在有系统地帮助中学语文教师解决语文教学上的问题，供给教学参考材料，研究教学方法，并及时总结和推广语文教学经验，逐步提高语文教师的教学能力。该刊的出版对于语文教师以及研究语文的同志有很大帮助。创刊号转载了本报社论“正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！”，并发表了吕叔湘的《关于词类的区分》，对二十多年来争论最多的词类区分作了分析，告诉读者：词的分类不是语法的全部内容，并且对于为实用的目的而学习语法的人来说，它是语法中比较不重要的一部分。这篇文章附带也说明了本报连载的《语法、修辞讲话》第一讲的性质。黎锦熙的《中学应系统地讲授语法》一文，说明教师必须充分掌握系统的语法知识，并且还要充分掌握一种有计划、有步骤、有重点的语法教程，才能搞好对学生的语法指导工作。邢公畹的《中国语言是落后的无语法的语言么》一文，批判了部分失去自信力的学者、文艺家、和文学改革家们，认为中国语言是落伍的、贫乏的、无语法的语言的错误看法。此外，尚有任铭善的《马克思主义语言学与中国语文教学问题》，张梅安的《修辞讲话》（连载），孙伏园的呐喊谈丛——《风波》等文章。
  全国各地卫生部门大力开展卫生宣传工作
    全国各地卫生部门为贯彻以预防为主的方针，特联合中央妇幼卫生工作大队、防疫队、以及各地群众团体，大力进行防疫种痘和加强学校健康教育等卫生宣传工作。宣传方式，大多采用巡回展览，结合幻灯、电影、座谈、广播、谈天等方式进行。有些地区并协助居民组，成立卫生行政小组；展开卫生竞赛，订立卫生公约，或借集训小学教师之便，传授种痘防疫知识和技术。如东北沈阳、哈尔滨、大连等十三个主要城市的中、小学都举办了卫生讲座、卫生墙报，开展群众性的保健运动。吉林卫生局并召集有关机关和群众团体组成卡介苗推行委员会，计划在八月份内完成四万九千七百三十六名儿童的试验和接种任务。上海市发动开业西医二千余人及经过短期训练的中医一千人，参加夏季防疫运动。哈尔滨市因为宣传工作做得好，今年春季种痘达六十七万人，占全市人口的百分之八十四。广州郊区施行预防霍乱注射的达全郊区人口的百分之九十五点五。
