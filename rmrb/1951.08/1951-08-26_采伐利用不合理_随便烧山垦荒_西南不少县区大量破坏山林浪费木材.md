　　Irrational Logging and Utilization·Reckless Burning of Mountains for Reclamation
    Significant Damage to Forests and Waste of Timber in Many Counties and Districts of Southwestern China

Due to the lack of thorough implementation of forestry policies in the Southwest region, many county and district governments and the masses have been indiscriminately felling and using forests, resulting in significant damage to forests and a large amount of timber waste. According to incomplete materials from various regions in the Southwest, in addition to the reports in the "Economic Life Dynamics" column on page 2 of the People's Daily on August 17th and 21st, the destruction of forests and the waste of timber also include the following aspects:

    I. Irrational felling and use: According to the investigation report of the Southwest Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Sichuan East Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Fuling Commissioner's Office, and the Fuling County People's Government in Anzheng Village, Qingyang Township, Ninth District of Fuling, the first procurement group of the Chongqing Municipal Organs Timber Joint Procurement Committee purchased a total of 5,000 bundles of pine boards (approximately 57,672 cubic feet) in Anzheng Village. Due to irrational felling and utilization, an average of about 1,482 logs with a mid-diameter (diameter measured from the middle of the tree) of six inches or more and a length of four feet or more (equivalent to 3,095 cubic feet) were abandoned in the mountains. The remaining tree stumps were as high as two to three feet.

    II. Waste of firewood. According to Engineer Wei Huanzhang of Yibin Paper Mill, Yibin County consumes about 100,000 dan of pine firewood per month, enough raw material to produce 50 tons of paper per day. Furthermore, of the 1.2 million people in Chongqing, approximately 68.8% burn firewood, consuming over 31.37 million jin of pine timber annually. Based on an estimate of 1,000 jin of pine timber per cubic meter, this equates to 31,370 cubic meters of pine timber. If a way can be found to get residents to switch to burning coal, a large amount of timber will not be wasted, and burning coal is cheaper than burning firewood, with an estimated annual savings of 3.42 billion yuan. Therefore, promoting coal burning to save timber is the most pressing issue at present.

    III. Waste caused by over-planned felling: The sleepers needed for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway were assigned to the people's governments at all levels along the railway to bear the task. In some areas, in order to "overfulfill the task," they indiscriminately felled timber beyond the plan. For example, the Southern Sichuan District exceeded the original plan by 326%, causing serious damage to the forests. In addition, due to the lack of technical guidance during felling, many of the felled timbers did not meet specifications, and large quantities were discarded and unused.

    IV. Waste caused by burning mountains for reclamation: For example, in Wengan, Pingyue, Guiding, Longli, Guizhu and other counties in Guizhou Province, the area of ​​mountains burned for reclamation from January to April this year reached 200 square li, and the forest trees destroyed exceeded the afforestation task of a special zone for one year. In Hetao Village, Xichang County, Xikang Province, more than 3,000 mu of mountains were burned for reclamation, and more than 100,000 trees were destroyed.

From the above situation, the problem of destroying forests and wasting timber in the Southwest region is very serious. If this continues, floods and droughts will increase, the supply of timber will become increasingly scarce, and agricultural production and industrial construction in the future will be affected. Relevant authorities should take steps to stop it as soon as possible.

### 采伐利用不合理·随便烧山垦荒  西南不少县区大量破坏山林浪费木材

　　采伐利用不合理·随便烧山垦荒
    西南不少县区大量破坏山林浪费木材
    西南区由于林业政策没有深入贯彻，以致不少县区政府及群众对森林乱加砍伐，随便使用，造成森林的大量破坏与木材的大量浪费。据西南各地区不完全的材料，森林的破坏与木材的浪费，除人民日报八月十七日第二版及二十一日同版《经济生活动态》栏的报道以外，还有以下几个方面：
    一、不合理的砍伐和使用：据西南农林部、川东农林厅会同涪陵专员公署及涪陵县人民政府在涪陵第九区青羊乡安正村的调查报告，重庆市各机关木材联合采购委员会第一采购组在安正村共买松板五千团（约合五万七千六百七十二立方市尺）。由于砍伐利用不合理，结果平均中径（即从树中段测量的直径）六市寸以上，长四市尺以上的原木，约有一千四百八十二段（折合三千零九十五立方市尺）均被弃于山中。所留伐根有高达二至三市尺者。
    二、烧柴的浪费。据宜宾造纸厂韦焕章工程师估计：宜宾县每月消耗松柴约十万担，足够每天造纸五十吨的原料。又重庆市的一百二十万人口中，约有百分之六十八点八的人口烧柴，每年约烧松木材三千一百三十七万余斤，按每一立方公尺松木材约等于一千市斤计算，共折合松木材三万一千三百七十立方公尺。如能设法使居民改烧煤炭，则大量的木材就不致被浪费，且烧煤比烧柴便宜，估计每年可节省人民币三十四亿二千余万元。因此提倡烧煤以节省木材是目前最迫切的问题。
    三、超计划采伐所造成的浪费：修筑成渝铁路所需枕木，系由铁路沿线各级人民政府分工负担任务。有的地区为了“超额完成任务”，就超计划地滥行采伐。如川南区就超出原订计划的百分之三百二十六，使森林遭到严重破坏。加上采伐时缺乏技术指导，许多伐下的木材都不合规格，大批的被丢弃不用。
    四、烧山垦荒所造成浪费：如贵州省瓮安、平越、贵定、龙里、贵筑等县，今年一月至四月烧山垦荒面积达二百平方里，烧毁的林木超过一个专区一年的造林任务。西康省西昌县核桃村因垦荒烧山达三千余亩，被烧毁的林木达十余万株。
    由以上情况看来，西南区破坏森林、浪费木材的问题是很严重的。若任其继续下去，则水、旱灾将会增多，木材的供应将愈感缺乏，将影响到今后的农业生产与工业建设，有关机关应早日设法予以制止。
