Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 21st: General Deng Hua, representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, delivered a speech at the memorial service for martyr Yao Qingxiang held by people from all walks of life in Kaesong. The full text of the speech is as follows:

　　Today, I come with a very heavy heart to mourn the death of my close comrade-in-arms, Platoon Leader Yao!

　　Platoon Leader Yao sacrificed himself for the cause of peace, for the implementation of the neutral zone agreement! He came for the cause of peace for the Korean people, the Chinese people, and the people of the Far East, and he died for the cause of peace. His death is glorious. However, we who live on feel great sorrow and indignation when we think of the circumstances of his death!

　　How did Platoon Leader Yao die? He died under the bullets of the enemies of peace. He resolutely abided by the regulations of the neutral zone and faithfully carried out his mission. But the enemies of peace shamelessly armed and attacked him, and were not satisfied after wounding him in the leg. They then shot him twice in the head. His comrades-in-arms, who were carrying out the mission with him, did not use their weapons because they strictly adhered to the regulations, and could only watch him die tragically under enemy fire!

　　Comrades! This fact shows how sincerely we love peace, how faithfully and resolutely we implement the agreement, and how untrustworthy, insidious, and vicious the enemies of peace are! The death of Platoon Leader Yao also teaches us that the struggle for peace is difficult and costly, and that the enemies of peace we face are cunning, violent, and shameless. Therefore, in order to strive for peace and defend peace, we must strengthen our preparations, heighten our vigilance, and meet the further provocations and attacks of the enemies of peace.

　　As a representative to the armistice negotiations, I vow to resolutely carry on the legacy of my comrade-in-arms and fight. If we cannot achieve peace through negotiations, then we must continue the struggle against aggression to win peace, to comfort the heroic souls of the dead.

　　Rest in peace, dear comrade-in-arms! We will work harder and harder to fulfill your legacy.

　　邓华将军讲话
    号召加强准备迎击敌人挑衅
    【新华社开城二十一日电】中国人民志愿军代表邓华将军在开城市各界追悼姚庆祥烈士大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    我今天怀着十分悲痛的心情来追悼我的亲密战友姚排长的死！
    姚排长是为了和平事业，为了执行中立区的协议而牺牲的！他为朝鲜人民、中国人民、远东人民的和平事业而来，为了和平事业而殉职，他的死是光荣的。但是，我们生者想到他的死难情形，却感到十分悲痛与愤慨！
    姚排长是怎样死的呢？他是死于和平的敌人的枪弹之下的，他坚决遵守中立区的规定，忠实执行任务。但是和平的敌人却无耻地武装袭击他，并在打伤他的腿部以后还不甘心，又在他头部补打了两枪，而与他一同执行任务的战友，也因为严格执行规定而没有使用武器，结果只好眼巴巴地望着他惨死于敌人枪弹之下了！
    同志们！这个事实表明了：我们是如何诚心诚意爱好和平，我们是如何忠实而坚决地执行协议，而和平的敌人又是如何地不讲信义，如何的阴险毒辣啊！姚排长的死难又教育了我们，争取和平的斗争是困难而代价巨大的，我们所面对的和平的敌人是诡计多端，狂暴无耻的。因此，为了争取和平与保卫和平，我们必须加强准备，提高警惕，以迎击和平之敌的进一步挑衅和进攻。
    作为一个停战谈判的代表，我发誓坚决秉承我的战友的遗志而奋斗。如果我们不能经过谈判而争得和平，那我们就必须继续用反侵略的斗争来赢得和平，以安慰死者的英魂。
    亲密的战友安息吧！我们将努力再努力以完成你的遗志。
