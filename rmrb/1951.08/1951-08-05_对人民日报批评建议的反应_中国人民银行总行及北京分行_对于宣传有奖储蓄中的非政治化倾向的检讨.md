Reactions to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily
    Self-Criticism of the People's Bank of China Headquarters and Beijing Branch Regarding the Non-Political Tendencies in Promoting Prize-Linked Savings

    I. Self-Criticism of the People's Bank of China Headquarters
    Comrades Editors:
    After reading Comrade Yan Cao's letter "The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China Has a Non-Political Tendency in Promoting Prize-Linked Savings" and the short commentary "Pay Attention to Politics" published in the People's Daily on July 14th, we examined the serious shortcomings in the political and ideological guidance of our publicity work. This has resulted in significant deviations in the publicity work of lower-level branches, and the headquarters should first conduct a profound self-criticism and take practical responsibility.

    Regarding this issue, the results of more than ten days of self-criticism by the responsible department are as follows:

    1. Although we have repeatedly pointed out in various instructions for expanding publicity work that the focus of propaganda should be on "elucidating the unity of savings with the interests of individuals and the state" and "coordinating with the patriotic upsurge of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, explaining that savings are a powerful tool for enriching national strength, stabilizing finance, and accelerating production and construction," ideologically we still believed that propaganda targeting the personal interests of certain groups could also achieve the goal of accumulating funds. We did not further realize that propaganda lacking political content would encourage the backward thinking of the masses, and business detached from political guidance would inevitably have no future. This is concretely reflected in the savings work reports of various rural branches, which frequently stated that "talking less about grand principles and focusing more on the personal interests of depositors is the most effective propaganda method." Our leadership not only failed to correct this economically-minded thinking that neglects politics in a timely manner, but on the contrary, selected some propaganda slogans that simply emphasized personal interests as "realistic and vivid" materials and published them in our internal publications. This should be the main reason for the chaotic phenomenon in the publicity work of lower-level branches.

    2. In the past month, the newspapers have repeatedly pointed out that government organs at all levels should attach importance to political education and constantly criticize all backward non-political thoughts; however, this did not attract our deep attention, and we did not immediately conduct inspections. This shows that the political sensitivity of the working cadres in our leading organs is greatly insufficient.

    Due to the existence of these shortcomings in our leading organs, the resulting purely economic tendency in propaganda work is not only manifested in Beijing and in the savings business, but is likely to exist in the propaganda work of other regions or other businesses. In order to bring our business propaganda into the realm of politics as a prerequisite, we will, on the one hand, inform the entire bank to conduct a comprehensive self-examination from top to bottom, thoroughly clarify all erroneous views of economicism that ignore politics, and on the other hand, organize a publicity review committee to strengthen the political and ideological guidance in business work, so as to improve the political and policy thinking of all cadres in the bank.

        Sincerely,
          People's Bank of China Headquarters

    II. Self-Criticism of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China
    Comrades Editors:
    The People's Daily published Comrade Yan Cao's letter and the newspaper's short commentary on July 14, criticizing the Beijing Branch's prize-linked savings propaganda for having a non-political tendency. We believe that this criticism plays an important role in improving our political level and clarifying the political and ideological guidance of publicity work. In addition to sincerely accepting and expressing our gratitude, we have conducted the following self-examination:

    Since its establishment, our prize-linked savings propaganda work has carried out some publicity, but it has been insufficient in mobilizing people to save, starting from the country's economic construction, and implementing patriotic ideological education. Therefore, some propaganda lacks political content and encourages the backward thinking of some people, which is extremely harmful.

    We examined all the propaganda materials, which can be roughly divided into three types:

    One type is the propaganda mentioned in Comrade Yan Cao's criticism that can only simply guide people to pursue personal interests, such as "Zhang San next door often goes out, but he doesn't have money to buy car tires, so he runs on broken ones; he won a prize in prize-linked savings, and now he rides a new car quickly." Similar situations also exist in the propaganda for recovering agricultural loans. In the slogans promoting rural lending, there is "Li Er is doing well in production, so he lends wealth to Ma Sanbao; Li gets three points of profit, and Ma's difficulties are solved; both the lender and the borrower benefit, and everyone gets rich together." This is a kind of propaganda with a purely economic viewpoint. During the inspection, we also found that individual propaganda slogans contain feudal colors, such as "Production is a money tree, and savings is a treasure bowl." This situation deserves our strict self-examination and correction.

    Another type of propaganda has some political content, but it is extremely unclear, or the combination is not appropriate, or it is not closely integrated with the current political tasks, such as "Save spare money in the bank to make long-term plans for cultivating the second generation of New China." There are also lengthy propaganda pieces that say a lot about things that are beneficial to individuals in the front, and then add two sentences at the end about accumulating funds for the country and investing in construction. This kind of propaganda is obviously the result of insufficient clarity in guiding ideology.

    The third type is to educate the people to combine national interests with personal interests and current political tasks, such as "Merit lies with the country, benefit lies with oneself," "One person saves, one family rejoices; everyone saves, the country prospers," "Saving one more prize-linked savings is equal to increasing one point of strength in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea," etc. These combine the interests of the country and the individual very well.

    The lack of political content in the above-mentioned propaganda fully demonstrates our low political level, insufficient attention to political work, and failure to effectively implement political thought into business propaganda. Although the leadership has repeatedly instructed and the newspapers have constantly criticized the non-political thought of "to get rich, grow cotton," it has not aroused our sufficient vigilance and serious inspection, resulting in a non-political tendency in some propaganda materials, which has given the people a harmful influence.

    In order to prevent this tendency from continuing, we have decided to first strengthen our study of politics and policies, improve our political level, pay attention to political and ideological guidance in business work, and continue to examine some non-political tendencies in the publicity and business work of the entire bank; through these self-examinations, we will enable all our comrades to improve politically.

    Secondly, we will organize an external propaganda research and review team to strengthen inspection and research, so as to improve our propaganda work and closely integrate business propaganda with the current political tasks.

                Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China

　　对人民日报批评建议的反应
    中国人民银行总行及北京分行
    对于宣传有奖储蓄中的非政治化倾向的检讨
    一、中国人民银行总行的检讨编辑同志：
    读七月十四日人民日报刊载燕草同志来信《中国人民银行北京分行对有奖储蓄的宣传有非政治化的倾向》及《注意政治》短评后，检查我们在宣传工作的政治思想指导上，所存在的缺点非常严重，致使下级行处的宣传工作出了很大偏差，这是总行首先应该深刻检讨切实负责的。
    关于这一问题，经过主管部门十多天的检讨结果如下：
    一、在各次布置扩大宣传工作指示中，虽一再指出应以“阐明储蓄对个人与国家利益的结合一致”，与“配合抗美援朝爱国热潮，说明储蓄是充实国家力量，稳定金融、加速生产建设的有力工具”为宣传重心；但思想上仍认为对某些对象，针对其个人切身利益进行宣传，也是同样可以达到积聚资金的目的的，却不曾进一步注意到缺乏政治内容的宣传，将会助长群众的落后思想，和脱离政治指导的业务必然毫无前途；具体表现在各农村行的储蓄工作报告中，曾经常反映“少谈大道理多从储户切身利益出发是收效最大的宣传方法”。我们领导上对这种忽视政治的经济主义思想，不但没有及时予以纠正，相反的还将一些单纯强调个人利益的宣传标语，当作“现实生动”的材料选入本行内部刊物上发表，应是造成下级行处宣传工作中的混乱现象的主要原因。
    二、最近一个月来，报纸上已一再指出：各级政府机关应重视政治教育并不断批判一切非政治化的落后思想；但并未引起我们深切注意，并马上进行检查，这说明我们领导机关工作干部的政治敏感是十分不够的。
    由于我们领导机关存在着这些缺点，影响所及，宣传工作上的单纯经济倾向，不仅表现在北京一个地方和储蓄一种业务上，其他地区或其他业务的宣传工作中，这种倾向，都是可能存在的。为把我们的业务宣传，纳入以政治为前提的领域，我们一方面通报全行进行自上而下的全面检查，彻底澄清一切忽视政治的经济主义的错误观点，一方面组织宣传审核委员会以加强业务工作中的政治思想指导，务使全行干部在政治政策思想上提高一步。
        此致   敬礼！
          中国人民银行总行
    二、中国人民银行北京分行的检讨编辑同志：
    人民日报七月十四日登载燕草同志来信及报社的短评，批评了北京分行有奖储蓄宣传有非政治化的倾向，我们认为这种批评对我们政治水平的提高及明确宣传工作的政治思想指导有着重要的作用，我们除诚恳地接受与表示感谢外，并进行了如下的检查：
    我们的有奖储蓄宣传工作，自创办以来虽然进行了些宣传，但对号召人民储蓄，首先从国家的经济建设出发，贯彻爱国主义的思想教育是不够的。因此，有些宣传缺乏政治内容，助长某些人的落后思想，这是极端有害的。
    我们检查了全部的宣传品，大概可分三种：
    一种是燕草同志批评中所指的只能单纯引导人民追逐个人利益的宣传，如“隔壁张三常出外，无钱买车鞋跑坏，有奖储蓄中了奖，骑着新车跑的快”。在收回农贷宣传中，亦有类似的情况。在提倡农村借贷中的标语，有“李二生产搞的好，富裕借给马三保，姓李的得了三分利，姓马的困难解决了，借贷双方都有益，发家致富大家好”。这是一种单纯经济主义观点的宣传，在检查中我们还发现个别宣传标语中含有封建的色彩如“生产就是摇钱树，储蓄就是聚宝盆”。这种情况值得我们严格检讨和纠正。
    另一种宣传虽有些政治内容，但极不明确，或结合的不够恰当，或没有与当前的政治任务密切结合起来，如“积攒零钱到银行储蓄，为培养新中国第二代作长远打算”。还有的长篇宣传品上，前面说了很多对个人有利的东西，最后加上两句对国家聚积资金，投入建设的结束语，这类宣传品显然是指导思想上不够明确的结果。
    第三种是以教育人民将国家利益与个人利益、和当前政治任务相结合，如“功在国家，利在自己”，“一人储蓄，一家欢乐；人人储蓄，国家富足”，“多存一张有奖储蓄，等于增加抗美援朝一分力量”等，这些是将国家的利益与个人利益很好地结合了的。
    以上部分宣传品中缺乏政治内容，充分表现了我们政治水平低，对政治工作注意不够，没有很好地将政治思想贯彻到业务宣传中去。虽然领导上一再指示，报纸上不断批判“要发家，种棉花”的非政治化的思想，但并未引起我们足够的警惕和认真的检查，以致造成在有些宣传品中，带有非政治化的倾向，而给予人民群众中以有害的影响。
    为使这种倾向不再继续存在下去，我们决定今后首先是加强我们政治与政策的学习，提高政治水平，注意业务工作中的政治思想指导，并继续检讨全行的宣传和业务工作中某些非政治的倾向；通过这些检讨，使我们全体同志在政治上提高一步。
    其次是组织对外宣传研究审查小组，以加强检查与研究，来改进我们宣传工作，使业务宣传与当前的政治任务密切地结合起来。
                中国人民银行北京分行
