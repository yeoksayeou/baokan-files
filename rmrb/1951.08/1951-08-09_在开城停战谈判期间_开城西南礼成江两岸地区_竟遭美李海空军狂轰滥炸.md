Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 8th. Our correspondent reports: During the Kaesong armistice negotiations, the US and Syngman Rhee forces' air and naval forces continued to madly bomb the sixty *li* coastal area on the east and west banks of the Ryesong River southwest of Kaesong, from Paekma-san to Ponghwa-ri. From July 25th to August 4th, according to incomplete statistics, more than one hundred peaceful residents in the area have been killed or wounded by the bombing, and nearly one hundred villages have been severely damaged. This is the so-called "air and naval superiority" that Ridgway's negotiating representatives boasted about at the Kaesong conference table.

　　At 11:20 on July 25, ten ships of the US and Syngman Rhee navy suddenly shelled the peaceful villages on the north bank of the Ryesong River estuary from the Hutoupu waters at the eastern end of Chodo Island. The local residents originally thought that the US and Syngman Rhee warships would not fire without reason during the armistice negotiations, so they were unprepared. Residents who remained in their houses only began to take cover after the shells hit, and many people who couldn't escape in time were killed or wounded by the shells. In Jitoupuli village alone, seventeen people were killed or wounded in an instant.

　　Since then, the US and Syngman Rhee warships have fired even more frantically day and night. Two hundred and thirty-one shells landed in Wangling-ri, a village of more than thirty households. Villages on both banks of the Ryesong River were engulfed in flames, and thick smoke filled the air. In Wolyam-ri, four out of a family of five were killed, leaving only a child who had returned from weeding in the fields, crying and looking at the charred bodies of his parents and sisters.

　　While the US and Syngman Rhee warships were bombing wildly, sixteen American planes also took turns to cooperate in the bombing, directing the warships' firing targets, and strafing the crowds fleeing from the artillery fire with machine guns. On August 3, a group of farm women who had fled from the Koch'on-ri area were walking on an open space when they were frantically strafed by low-flying American planes. The defenseless women were forced to take off the white cloths on their heads and wave them at the American planes, indicating that they were a group of unarmed women. But the inhuman American air force dropped eight more bombs, causing many more casualties among the farmers who had luckily escaped the artillery fire.

　　在开城停战谈判期间
　  开城西南礼成江两岸地区
　　竟遭美李海空军狂轰滥炸
    【新华社开城八日电】本社记者报道：在开城停战谈判期中，美、李军的海空军继续狂轰滥炸开城西南礼成江东西两岸白马山至烽火里的六十华里沿海地区。从七月二十五日起，到八月四日止，据不完全统计，该地已有一百多个和平居民被炸死炸伤，近百个村庄遭到严重破坏。这就是李奇微的谈判代表在开城会议席上所吹嘘的所谓“海空军优势”。
    七月二十五日十一点二十分，美、李海军的十艘舰艇，在乔洞岛东端虎头浦海面突然朝着礼成江入口处北岸的和平农村开炮轰击。当地居民原以为在停战谈判期中，美、李军舰不会无故发炮，所以未加防备。留在屋里的居民，在炮弹打来后始躲避，好多来不及避开的人都被炮弹打死打伤。仅基头浦里一个庄子，顷刻间就死伤十七人。
    自此以后，美李舰艇更日夜疯狂发炮轰击。三十余户的旺陵里就落弹二百三十一发。礼成江两岸村庄大火冲天，浓烟弥漫。月岩里有一家五口人就有四个人被炸死，只剩下一个从田里拔草回家的孩子，看着被烧焦了的父母姐妹的尸体哭叫。
    在美、李舰艇大肆轰击的同时，十六架美国飞机也轮番配合轰炸，指示舰艇射击目标，并以机枪往返扫射奔逃于炮火中的人群。八月三日，有一群从高尺里一带逃出来的农妇正走到一段开阔地上，遭到低飞的美国飞机的疯狂扫射。毫无抵抗能力的妇女们被迫摘下头上的白巾向美机挥动，表示她们是一群手无寸铁的妇女。但是毫无人性的美国空军又扔下来八颗炸弹，以致这批侥幸逃出炮火的农民又伤亡了很多人。
