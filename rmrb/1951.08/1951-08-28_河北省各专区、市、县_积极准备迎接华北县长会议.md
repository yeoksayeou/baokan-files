Hebei Province's Various Special Districts, Cities, and Counties
Actively Prepare to Welcome the North China County Magistrate Conference

Hebei Province's various special districts, cities, and counties all attach great importance to the upcoming first North China County Magistrate Conference and are now actively preparing in conjunction with current work. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has dispatched personnel to participate in the work of the Provincial Government's Administrative Construction Office. The General Office of the Provincial People's Government is organizing and promoting the study of important administrative construction documents by cadres of the provincial government organs, and is collecting and sorting out administrative construction materials in conjunction with the preparations for the provincial secretariat meeting. Comrade Chen Houci, a member of the Provincial Consultative Committee, and Ren Kefei, Director of the Secretariat, personally went to Mancheng and Qingyuan to attend meetings. The Personnel Bureau has begun to sort out issues related to the promotion, supplementation, training, cultivation, and living standards of cadres; it is also collecting materials on administrative construction and preferential treatment. The Department of Civil Affairs, in addition to some cadres participating in other necessary work and persisting in daily essential tasks, is concentrating its efforts on preparing for the North China County Magistrate Conference. Deputy Director Wang Jiande voluntarily suspended his convalescence and insisted on working despite his illness. At the same time, Director Dong Luan of the Provincial Government Supervisory Committee, Secretary-General Liu Hongtao of the Consultative Committee, and Deputy Secretary-General Gao Tieying of the General Office are guiding this work, enabling the work of the Provincial Government's Administrative Construction Office to achieve great results.

In the province's special districts, cities, counties, towns, and mining areas, the leading cadres generally took charge and personally took action, proceeding according to plan. The comprehensive materials from each special district and the summary reports from key counties, with the exception of Hengshui Special District, were able to be sent to the province around August 20. As for preferential treatment materials, five special commissioner's offices, namely Baoding, Cangxian, Hengshui, Tianjin, and Dingxian, and six counties, namely Laiyuan, Fangshan, Zanhuang, Liangxiang, Xianghe, and Guantao, as well as the two cities of Baoding and Shijiazhuang, have sent in some materials. As for administrative construction materials, twenty-six counties, namely Fangshan, Sanhe, Tongxian, Linyu, Fengrun, Luannan, Qingxian, Suning, Renqiu, Xianxian, Hejian, Cangxian, Boye, Baxian, Tianjin, Laishui, Xianghe, Miyun, Shunyi, Gu'an, Xingtang, Jianguo, Lixian, Qianxi, Huanghua, and Jiaohe, three towns, namely Linqing, Cangxian, and Botou, two special districts, namely Cangxian and Tianjin, and three cities, namely Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and Qinhuangdao, have sent in some materials (some of which are complete). Judging from these materials, everyone has conscientiously conducted summaries; some have done a very good job, with situations, problems, self-criticisms, and opinions, such as Lixian County, Boye County, and Shijiazhuang City. Gaocheng County collected materials in groups and then sorted them out. Huolu County first conducted a small-scale summary of the past people's representative conferences and people's congresses, and then made a general summary; these methods are good. However, in general, there is a lack of analysis and criticism, or it is not deep enough. They have failed to conduct self-criticism and summarize experience in light of the spirit of the documents and the actual situation; some have even simply followed the outline issued and answered questions "by topic;" many county reports have incomplete or incorrect statistics due to careless preservation of past archive materials.

Regarding the study of administrative construction documents, most have completed the study of Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing. Shijiazhuang Special District began studying on August 1st for two weeks. Cadres above the section chief level in each county studied for three weeks, conducted inspections before August 15th, and conducted summaries after completing the study. The counties in Handan Special District completed their study plans before August 15th. The special commissioner's office also plans to conduct tests. All cadres in Tongxian Special District studied in their respective sections from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM every day. Dingxian and Hengshui Special Districts studied for two hours every night. Tangshan Special District began studying for one and a half hours every day from August 2nd. A county magistrate conference was convened on August 20th to conduct inspections and tests. Cangxian Special District set aside three half-days a week for study. According to statistics from Tianjin Special District's counties and towns on July 29th, cadres, although busy fighting locusts, also studied for five or six days. The Baodi County Magistrate also gave an enlightening report, and after August 1st, they began to implement the plan. In general, the problems existing in the study are: there are many general appeals, a lack of specific organization and promotion, and forceful inspections, most have not implemented the plan, the participation of cadres is not widespread, there are shortcomings in the study methods, and the focus is not clear. During the study in Shijiazhuang City, it was discovered that eight out of twelve cadres in one district did not understand the difference between the People's Congress, the All-Circles People's Representative Conference acting on behalf of the People's Congress, and the All-Circles People's Representative Conference. Seven out of ten cadres in the third district were unclear about the nature of the New Democratic regime, and five cadres did not understand the "four friends, three enemies," saying it was "our poor people's regime." Some believe that holding representative conferences is a task assigned by the higher authorities, "do what you are told," "holding representative conferences, cadres do not go down to work, and tasks cannot be completed, what can the representatives do?" Many mass organization cadres in the districts believe that it is "the district government's business" and has nothing to do with them.

In response to the above situation, in order to improve the understanding of cadres, the provincial government gave a report by Vice Chairman Jin Cheng on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month to promote the administrative construction study of cadres in provincial-level agencies. At the same time, the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs has instructed all localities:

1. In the study of administrative construction documents, it is necessary to implement according to plan, overcome the phenomenon of separation between plan and action, and conscientiously conduct inspections in light of the spirit of the documents and in connection with work. The focus should be on Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Third People's Representative Conference of Beijing, the instructions of the Central Government Administration Council on the construction of the people's democratic regime, and the organizational rules of the All-Circles People's Representative Conference of the County and the organizational rules of the People's Government of the County. Leading cadres should promptly answer questions, and report the study situation in a timely manner.

2. Continue to urge all localities to step up preparations. The provincial government convened Tianjin, Changli, Liangxiang, Wu'an, Nangong, Shenxian, and the county magistrates and commissioners of the two special districts of Shijiazhuang and Baoding to report to the provincial government in batches around the 20th. On August 16, they telegraphed all localities to conduct serious inspections based on the People's Daily editorial on August 14, "County People's Representative Conferences That Have Not Been Held Well Must Be Examined," and to collect them as separate materials, report them level by level, and send the self-criticisms of the relevant counties directly to the People's Daily for publication at the end of the month, and report them to the province at the same time.

3. Organize the following materials before the end of August: (1) Administrative Construction Office: (1) Inspection report on the All-Circles People's Representative Conference. (2) Summary of the study of important administrative construction documents. (3) Compilation of key counties and typical materials and timely notification to all localities to report to the central government. (4) Various statistical figures related to democratic administrative construction work. (5) Opinions on the issue of district divisions below the county level. (2) Suggestions for relevant departments to summarize: (1) Summary of the work of the county standing committee (Consultative Committee). (2) Opinions on the promotion, supplementation, training, cultivation, and living standards of cadres (Personnel Bureau). (3) Issues related to the establishment of institutions and the rational adjustment of the establishment of government personnel below the county level (Establishment Committee). (4) Leadership issues of the county people's government (General Office). (5) Leadership issues of districts and villages (Organization Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party). (3) Preferential Treatment Bureau: (1) Half-year summary of preferential treatment work. (2) Separate materials such as substitute cultivation and job placement. (3) Summary of the work of honorary schools and sanatoriums. (4) Opinions on in-kind subsidies for families of martyrs and soldiers. (5) Statistical charts of martyrs, soldiers, workers, honorary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers in the province. (6) Opinions on the admission of children of martyrs and soldiers. (7) Placement and management of honorary soldiers and demobilized soldiers. (8) Construction of martyrs' cemeteries.

　　河北省各专区、市、县
    积极准备迎接华北县长会议
    河北省各专区、市、县均重视即将召开的华北第一次县长会议，现正结合当前工作积极进行准备。中共河北省委派专人参加省府建政办公室工作，省人民政府办公厅正组织推动省府机关干部学习建政重要文件，并结合全省秘书会议的准备工作搜集与整理建政材料。省协商委员会谌厚慈委员、任克非秘书主任，亲赴满城、清苑参加会议。人事局已开始整理关于干部的提拔、补充、训练、培养及生活待遇等问题；同时搜集建政、优抚材料。民政厅除部分干部参加其他必要工作和坚持日常必须处理的事情外，集中力量搞迎接华北县长会议的准备工作。王建德副厅长自动停止休养，带病坚持工作。同时，由省府监察委员会董鲁安主任、协商委员会刘洪涛秘书长、办公厅高铁英副秘书长，指导这一工作，使省府建政办公室工作收到很大成绩。
    该省各专区、市、县、镇、矿区一般作到了首长负责亲自动手，按照计划进行。各专区的全面材料及重点县的总结报告，除衡水专区外均能在八月二十日左右送省。优抚材料已有保定、沧县、衡水、天津、定县等五个专署，涞源、房山、赞皇、良乡、香河、馆陶等六县及保定、石家庄二市送来一部。建政材料，已有房山、三河、通县、临榆、丰润、滦南、青县、肃宁、任邱、献县、河间、沧县、博野、霸县、天津、涞水、香河、密云、顺义、固安、行唐、建国、蠡县、迁西、黄骅、交河共二十六县，临清、沧县、泊头三镇，沧县、天津两专区及唐山、石家庄、秦皇岛三市已送来材料一部（其中有的是全部材料）。从这些材料看来，大家均认真进行了总结，有的作的很好，有情况，有问题，有检讨，有意见，如蠡县、博野县、石家庄市等。藁城县是分组搜集，进行整理。获鹿县是对过去人民代表会议与人民代表大会逐次进行小结后，再作总的整理，这些办法都是好的。但一般多是缺乏分析批判，或不够深刻。未能根据文件精神，联系实际情况进行检讨，总结经验；甚至只是依照所发提纲“按题作文”一问一答；不少县份报告，因过去档案材料保管不慎，数字统计多不完整或有错误。
    在建政文件学习方面，一般已学完毛主席“论人民民主专政”及刘少奇副主席在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话。石家庄专区已在八月一日开始学习，进行两周。各县科长以上干部学习三周，八月十五日前进行检查，学完后进行总结。邯郸专区各县八月十五日前完成学习计划。专署并拟进行测验。通县专区全体干部每日下午五点到六点半以科为单位学习。定县、衡水两专区每晚学习两小时。唐山专区自八月二日开始每日学习一时半。并于八月二十日召开县长会议，检查测验。沧县专区每星期抽出三个半天进行学习。据天津专区各县、镇七月二十九日统计，干部虽忙于打蝗，也学习了五、六天。宝坻县长并作了启发报告，八月一日后又开始按计划执行。总的来看，学习中存在的问题是：一般号召多，缺乏具体组织推动与有力的检查，多未按计划执行，参加干部不普遍，学习方法有缺点，重点不明确。石家庄市在学习中发现一区十二个干部中有八人闹不清人民代表大会、各界人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权，和各界人民代表会议的区别。三区十个干部中有七人对新民主主义政权性质不明确，五个干部弄不清“四个朋友，三个敌人”，说是“咱们穷人的政权”。有的认为开代表会议是上级交给的任务，“叫闹就闹”，“开代表会，干部不下去工作，任务也完不成，代表们能干什么？”区群众团体干部多认为那是“区公所的事”，与自己无关。
    针对上述情况，为了提高干部认识，该省府已于本月二十二日下午由金城副主席作报告，推动省级各机关干部的建政学习。同时省府民政厅已指示各地：
    一、在建政文件的学习上必须按照计划执行，克服计划与行动脱节的现象，并要认真根据文件精神联系工作进行检查，要以刘少奇副主席在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话及中央政务院关于人民民主政权建设工作的指示和县各界人民代表会议组织通则、县人民政府组织通则为重点。首长要及时解答问题，学习情况及时报告。
    二、继续督促各地加紧准备工作。省府召集天津、昌黎、良乡、武安、南宫、深县及石家庄、保定两专区各县长、专员于二十日前后分批来省府汇报。并于八月十六日已电告各地根据人民日报八月十四日“县人民代表会议没有开好的必须检讨”的社论，进行认真的检查，作为单项材料一并汇集，逐级上报，有关县份的检讨在月底直接送人民日报发表，并同时报省。
    三、八月底前整理以下材料：（一）建政办公室：（１）对各界人民代表会议的检查报告。（２）建政重要文件学习总结。（３）重点县及典型材料的整理并随时通报各地呈报中央。（４）有关民主建政工作的各种数字统计。（５）有关县以下区划问题的意见。（二）建议有关部门总结：（１）县常务委员会工作总结（协商委员会）。（２）干部的提拔、补充、训练、培养及生活待遇等问题的意见（人事局）。（３）有关机构的设置及县以下政府编制人员的合理调整问题（编制委员会）。（４）县人民政府的领导问题（办公厅）。（５）对区村的领导问题（中共河北省委组织部）。（三）优抚局：（１）优抚工作半年总结。（２）代耕、介绍职业等单项材料。（３）荣校教养院工作总结。（４）关于烈、军属实物补助意见。（５）全省烈、军、工属、荣军、复员军人数字图表。（６）烈、军属子弟入学意见。（７）荣军、复员军人的安置管理。（８）烈士陵园的修建。
