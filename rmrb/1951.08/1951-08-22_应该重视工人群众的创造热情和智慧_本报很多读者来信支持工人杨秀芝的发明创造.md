A Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

　　Should Value the Creative Enthusiasm and Wisdom of the Working Masses.
    Many Readers of This Newspaper Sent Letters Supporting the Inventions and Creations of Worker Yang Xiuzhi

    (I)
    The Central Technical Administration's perfunctory attitude towards worker Yang Xiuzhi's inventions and creations, as well as the fact that the bureau has over 200 backlogged inventions, should attract attention from all parties. If this situation is not immediately corrected, it will be a great obstacle to the development of the working class's creativity and will be extremely harmful to the economic construction of the New China!
    As the People's Daily editor's note pointed out, the Central Technical Administration has erroneous conservative ideas in dealing with Yang Xiuzhi's inventions and creations. The essence of this conservative thinking is blindly worshipping imperialist technology and not believing that the great working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party, can exert their infinite wisdom to create and invent things beneficial to the construction of the motherland. Countless ironclad facts since liberation have not yet completely corrected their deeply rooted conservative ideas, making them ideologically believe in the power of the working class.
    For the benefit of the people, I suggest that the relevant higher authorities should inspect the work of the Central Technical Administration and conduct strict criticism and education.

    (II) To the Editor:
    From Comrade Jiang Ping's letter published in the People's Daily "Readers' Letters Page" on August 15, entitled "The Central Technical Administration Should Adopt a Positive and Supportive Attitude Towards Worker Yang Xiuzhi's Inventions and Creations," we can see that the Central Technical Administration has serious erroneous ideas of not valuing and not trusting the wisdom of the working class, as well as bureaucratic work styles. They do not understand that the working class of the New China, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will exert unparalleled strength and wisdom to build their own country.
    Worker Yang Xiuzhi's inventions and creations have been praised and supported by the printing industry all over the country, while the Central Technical Administration has adopted a dismissive and shelved attitude. According to comrades Liu Huandong and Meng Guangzhao of the bureau, the bureau has "over 200 cases of backlogged inventions and creations," which is a very serious problem. These more than 200 inventions are the achievements made by the masses of the people at the cost of countless efforts under the enthusiastic promotion of the motherland's construction cause, and some of them must have made great contributions to the motherland's construction. What reason does the Central Technical Administration have to backlog them? I think the Central Technical Administration should thoroughly examine its work, earnestly and promptly deal with these inventions and creations, and enthusiastically assist and encourage the creators. Only in this way can it conform to the spirit of the Government Administration Council's "Decision on Rewarding Inventions, Technical Improvements and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production," and only then will it not fail the enthusiasm of the national people for the cause of national construction.

  (III) To the Editor:
    After reading the article "The Central Technical Administration Should Adopt a Positive and Supportive Attitude Towards Worker Yang Xiuzhi's Inventions and Creations" published in the People's Daily "Readers' Letters Page" on August 15, we fully support the leadership of the Printing Factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region in taking concrete assistance and a positive and supportive attitude towards the "automatic binding machine" created by worker Yang Xiuzhi. This attitude encourages and promotes the enthusiasm and wisdom of the working class of the New China in the great cause of building the motherland. On the contrary, we believe that the Central Technical Administration's cold and perfunctory attitude towards inventions and creations that conform to mechanical principles and have the possibility of realization is extremely wrong. This erroneous attitude has already dampened the enthusiasm of the working masses, stifled the wisdom of the working masses, and is very harmful to the national construction cause. Therefore, we suggest that the Central Technical Administration quickly correct this erroneous attitude, earnestly and enthusiastically handle the creations of the masses, and provide the inventors with the necessary assistance, so that the fruits of the wisdom of the workers of the New China can meet the people as soon as possible.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　应该重视工人群众的创造热情和智慧
    本报很多读者来信支持工人杨秀芝的发明创造  
    （一）
    中央技术管理局对工人杨秀芝的发明创造采取敷衍应付态度及该局积压发明创造二百余件的事实，应该引起各方面的注意。这种情况如不立即纠正，对于工人阶级的创造性的发挥是很大的障碍，对于新中国的经济建设事业也有极大的危害！
    正如人民日报编者按语中指出，中央技术管理局在处理杨秀芝的发明创造时有着错误的保守思想。这种保守思想的实质，就是盲目崇拜帝国主义的技术，而不相信伟大的工人阶级在共产党领导之下，能够发挥他们无限的智慧，创造、发明对祖国建设有利的东西。解放后无数铁的事实还没有把他们根深蒂固的保守思想彻底纠正过来，使他们从思想上相信工人阶级的力量。
    为了人民的利益，我建议有关上级机关应该对于中央技术管理局的工作进行检查，并进行严格的批评教育。

    （二）编辑同志：
    从八月十五日人民日报《读者来信专页》发表的江萍同志关于《中央技术管理局对工人杨秀芝的发明创造应采取积极支持的态度》的来信中，我们可以看出：中央技术管理局有着严重的不重视及不信任工人阶级智慧的错误思想和官僚主义作风。他们不懂得，新中国的工人阶级，在共产党的领导下，会发挥出无比的力量和智慧，来建设自己的国家。
    工人杨秀芝的发明创造已得到全国各地印刷界的赞扬和支持；而中央技术管理局却采取了轻视和搁置的态度。又据该局刘焕东、孟广照二同志谈，该局“积压发明创造的案件有二百余件”，这是多么严重的问题。这二百余件发明，都是人民群众在对祖国建设事业的热情推动下花费无数心血而做出的成绩，其中一定有许多对祖国建设有很大贡献的创造。中央技术管理局有何理由把它们积压呢？我认为中央技术管理局应该彻底检查一下自己的工作，认真及早处理这些发明创造，热情地协助和鼓励创造者。这样才能符合政务院《关于奖励有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的决定》的精神，才不辜负全国人民群众对国家建设事业的热情。

  （三）编辑同志：
    读了人民日报八月十五日《读者来信专页》所载《中央技术管理局对工人杨秀芝的发明创造应采取积极支持的态度》一文后，我们完全拥护华北军区政治部印刷厂领导方面，对工人杨秀芝创造“自动装订机”所采取的具体帮助和积极支持的态度。这种态度鼓励与发扬了新中国工人阶级在建设祖国的伟大事业中，所发挥的热情与智慧。相反地，中央技术管理局对符合机械原理，而有实现可能的发明创造，却采取了冷淡、敷衍态度，我们认为是极端错误的。这种错误态度，已经打击了工人群众的热情，窒塞了工人群众的智慧，对国家建设事业有很大危害的。因此，我们建议中央技术管理局迅速纠正这种错误态度，认真地、热情地处理群众的创造，给予发明创造者以必要的帮助，使新中国工人智慧的成果早日与人民见面。
