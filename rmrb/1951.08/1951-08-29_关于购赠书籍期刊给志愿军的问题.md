　　Regarding the Question of Purchasing and Donating Books and Periodicals to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

　　Question: What is the status of book and newspaper supplies to the Volunteer Army? What kind of books and newspapers does the Volunteer Army need now?

　　Answer: The supply of books and periodicals to the Volunteer Army has recently been improved, mainly due to: (1) The China Peace Committee has decided to use past donations from the people to purchase and send a batch of books and periodicals to the front lines. The types and quantities purchased and sent are as follows: (A) Periodicals: 30,000 copies of special edition supplements on Resisting America, Aiding Korea, 30,000 copies of "Current Affairs Handbook," 40,000 copies of "Lianhuan Pictorial," 20,000 copies of "People's Weekly," 20,000 copies of the elementary edition of "Study," 10,000 copies of "Study," 5,000 copies of "New China Monthly," 10,000 copies of "World Knowledge," 10,000 copies of "New Observer," 5,000 copies of "Literary Gazette"; (B) Books: 20,000 copies of Comrade Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China," 20,000 copies of Comrade Chen Boda's "On Mao Zedong Thought – The Combination of Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese Revolution," and 40,000 copies of "A Brief History of the Communist Party of China" compiled by the "Study" Magazine Elementary Edition Materials Office. (2) The book donation campaign launched by Xinhua Bookstore has achieved great success. According to statistics, the people of China have donated more than 5.5 million books and periodicals to the Volunteer Army, and these books are being shipped to the front lines one after another. The book donation campaign launched by Xinhua Bookstore has a shortcoming, which is that it did not formulate a list of recommended types of books and periodicals in advance, so that some books and periodicals are not suitable for the needs of the Volunteer Army soldiers.

　　Based on the above situation, when patriotic compatriots from all over the country donate books and periodicals to the Volunteer Army in the future, it is hoped that they will pay attention to donating some comic books, popular pamphlets, and periodicals with correct content and educational significance, so that ordinary literate soldiers can read them, and illiterate soldiers can understand them, and after reading them, they can improve their understanding and determination to fight for the motherland, for the people, and for the just cause of world peace and democracy. At the same time, in addition to the periodicals already recommended in the current affairs commentary "Please Send More Spiritual Food to the Volunteer Army" in the 31st issue of the "Resist America, Aid Korea" special publication, the China Peace Committee will also work with Xinhua Bookstore to formulate a catalog of books and periodicals to be donated to the front lines and distribute it to various regions for reference.

　　Question: What are the specific methods for purchasing and donating books and periodicals to the Volunteer Army?

　　Answer: The China Peace Committee has consulted with Xinhua Bookstore (hereinafter referred to as "Xinhua"), China Book Distribution Company (hereinafter referred to as "Zhongtu"), and the postal authorities: The work of purchasing and donating books and periodicals to the Volunteer Army will be handled separately by Xinhua, Zhongtu, postal authorities, and their branches in various regions; and the methods are as follows:

　　(A) For sporadic purchases or subscriptions, one can bring or send money to the local branches of Xinhua, Zhongtu, and the post office, refer to the "Catalog of Books and Periodicals Donated to the Front Lines" to specify which books and periodicals to purchase or subscribe to, or ask the bookstore or post office to purchase or subscribe to appropriate books and periodicals on their behalf. After receiving the payment, the local branches of Xinhua, Zhongtu, and the post office should immediately stamp the selected books and periodicals with a seal engraved with "Donated to the Volunteer Army by So-and-So (referring to the donor), So-and-So (referring to the branch of the bookstore or post office acting as an agent for sending to the front lines)," and be responsible for sending them to the front lines; at the same time, issue a receipt with the same seal to the donor as a souvenir. The Xinhua, Zhongtu, and postal branches should report the types and quantities of books and periodicals donated by people from all walks of life to their headquarters and the Resist America, Aid Korea sub-committees and the general committee on a monthly basis, in order to make planned adjustments; and publicize them in the local newspapers.

　　(B) For large-scale purchases or subscriptions, one can bring or send money to Xinhua, Zhongtu, or the post office in Shanghai, Beijing, Shenyang, Hankou, or Chongqing for processing, as other places lack the printing conditions and cannot handle large-scale subscription and printing matters. As for the purchase and sending procedures, they are the same as those stipulated in item A.

　　关于购赠书籍期刊给志愿军的问题
    问：对志愿军的书报供应状况怎样？现在志愿军需要一些什么书报？
    答：最近对志愿军的书籍期刊供应，正在改进，这主要地是由于：（一）抗美援朝总会已决定动用过去的人民捐款，购送一批书刊送到前方去。购送的种类及数字如下：（甲）期刊：抗美援朝专刊单行本三万份，时事手册三万份，连环画报四万份，人民周报二万份，学习初级版二万份，学习一万份，新华月报五千份，世界知识一万份，新观察一万份，文艺报五千份；（乙）书籍：胡乔木同志著的《中国共产党的三十年》二万册，陈伯达同志著的《论毛泽东思想——马克思列宁主义与中国革命的结合》二万册，学习杂志初级版资料室编的《中国共产党简史》四万册。（二）新华书店所发动的募书运动已获得很大成绩，据统计全国各地人民捐给志愿军的书刊已超过五百五十万册，这些书籍现已陆续运送前方。新华书店发动的募书运动有一个缺点，就是没有事先拟定捐献书刊的种类和计划，以致有一部分书刊不适合志愿军战士们的需要。
    根据上述情况，今后各地各界爱国同胞捐送书刊给志愿军时，希望注意捐送一些内容正确并富有教育意义的连环图画，通俗的小册子和期刊，以便普通识字的战士都能阅读，不识字的也能听得懂，并在阅读后能够提高他们为祖国、为人民、为世界和平民主正义事业而作战的认识和决心。同时，除抗美援朝专刊第三十一期时评“请多多把精神食粮送给志愿军”中已推荐的期刊外，抗美援朝总会即将会同新华书店拟定捐送前方的图书期刊目录，发给各地参考。
    问：购赠书籍期刊给志愿军的具体办法怎样？
    答：抗美援朝总会已与新华书店（以下简称“新华”）、中国图书发行公司（以下简称“中图”）及邮局方面商定：购赠书籍期刊给志愿军的工作，分别由新华、中图、邮局和它们的各地分支机构办理；并商定办法如下：
    （甲）零星购赠或订赠的，可持款或寄款至新华、中图及邮局的各地分支机构，参考《捐献前方的图书期刊目录》指定购订何种书刊，或请书店或邮局代为购订适当书刊。新华、中图、邮局各地分支机构收到书款后，应即根据赠送人的意见或其委托，在选定的书刊上打上刻有“某某某（指赠书人）捐赠志愿军，某某某（指代办寄送前方的书店或邮局的分支机构）”的图章，并负责寄送前方；同时，发给赠送人以盖有同上图章的收据一纸，以为纪念。新华、中图、邮局各分支机构应按月一面向它们的总机构及抗美援朝分会和总会汇报各界人民捐赠书刊的种类及数字，以便作有计划的调整；一面在当地报纸上予以公布。
    （乙）大批购赠或订赠的，可持款或寄款至上海、北京、沈阳、汉口或重庆新华、中图或邮局办理，其他地方因缺乏印刷条件，不能代办大批订印事宜。至于购送手续，与甲项的规定相同。
