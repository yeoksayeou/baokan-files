　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 14th. According to TASS, the Presidium of the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany held a press conference on the 11th, distributing the "White Paper on US and British Policy of Interference in West Germany and the Revival of German Imperialism" to German and foreign journalists.
    Comrade Correns, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany, explained the purpose of publishing the white paper at the press conference. He pointed out that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France intend to openly begin rebuilding the German army in West Germany in the coming weeks, which poses a very dangerous threat to the peace of all nations and the national survival of Germany. The purpose of publishing this white paper is to expose the anti-human plans of the imperialist robbers, bloody militarists, and their accomplices. The white paper collects a wealth of materials, exposing the United States, Britain, and France for deliberately violating the Yalta and Potsdam agreements, restoring German military industry, insisting on dividing Germany, and instructing the West German secessionist government to condone fascists and persecute peace-loving people and organizations. The white paper also includes a large number of documents on the remilitarization of West Germany, exposing the United States' illegal release of German militarists and war criminals, allowing West Germany to have a general staff headquarters, and formulating detailed plans for rebuilding the German army.
    Correns emphasized that the war-mongers' plans are not only aimed at opposing the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and the People's Democracies. The West German army being built also poses a threat to the independence and security of France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, and all other Western European peoples. The National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany calls on all peace-loving people to actively oppose the imperialists' war preparations.

　　民主德国全国阵线发表白皮书
    揭露美英武装西德计划
    号召人民积极反对帝国主义的战争准备
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团十一日举行记者招待会，将《关于美英两国干涉西德的政策与德国帝国主义复活的白皮书》分发给德国与外国记者。
    民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团主席科伦斯在招待会上解释发表这一白皮书的目的。他指出：美、英、法三国政府打算在最近几周公开着手在西德重建德国军队，这使得各国人民的和平与德国的民族生存受到非常危险的威胁。发表这一白皮书的目的，就在于揭发帝国主义强盗、血腥的军国主义分子及其帮凶们的这种敌对人类的计划。这个白皮书中收集了许多材料，揭发美、英、法三国故意违背雅尔塔与波茨坦协定，恢复德国军事工业，坚持分裂德国，指使西德分裂政府纵容法西斯分子而迫害拥护和平的人士和组织。白皮书中并包括大批关于西德进行重新军国主义化情形的文件，揭发美国非法释放德国军国主义分子与战犯，允许西德拥有参谋总部，并正在详细制订重建德国军队的计划。
    科伦斯强调指出：战争贩子的计划不仅是为了反对苏联、德意志民主共和国与人民民主国家。建立中的西德军队也是对法国、比利时、意大利、荷兰与一切其他西方国家人民的独立与安全的威胁。民主德国全国阵线全国委员会号召一切爱好和平的人们积极反对帝国主义者的战争准备。
