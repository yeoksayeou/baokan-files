　　How I Wrote "The Long March"
    Li Bozhao
    I had the desire to write this epic of "The Long March" several years ago, but I only sporadically recorded some fragments of historical material, and I could never bring myself to start writing. Starting from July last year, I took three months of leave to sort out the materials on the Long March, study published stories, communications, plays, etc., about the Long March, and make various preparations for writing "The Long March."
    What was my motivation for writing "The Long March"? What force pushed me to write it no matter what? Looking back, because I was in the Red Army for so many years, I felt deeply about two points: First, the Red Army were the sons of workers and peasants, who voluntarily joined the army. They all participated in the political struggle to fight local tyrants and divide the land, and obtained the benefits of the revolution. The special quality of this army is reflected in its fish-and-water relationship with the masses. Wherever it went, the masses welcomed and supported it. Second, within the ranks of the Red Army, there was a very noticeable, indescribably good relationship between people, and a lovable style. Soldiers loved soldiers, soldiers loved officers, officers loved soldiers; subordinates loved superiors, subordinate commanders respected superior commanders, and consciously obeyed orders; while superior commanders and lower-level cadres cared for and cherished the combatants, concerned themselves with political education, so that the entire army was completely integrated in terms of political thought, lively spirit, and pure comradeship. Regardless of whose heroic behavior, achievements, shortcomings, illnesses, pains, casualties, and losses, they were all events of collective concern. No one's actions could be separated from the collective. They had a common revolutionary ideal. Therefore, this army was invincible. No matter what difficult circumstances it faced, no matter how powerful the enemy was, it could not be scattered or crushed. Conversely, if the enemy wanted to extend a finger and dare to touch any Red fighter, all the Red fighters would bravely defend their relatives, and they would definitely concentrate their strength to chop off the enemy's finger. The interests of the collective were the guiding principle of all the Red Army's actions. The Red Army was such an army full of revolutionary ideals. I believe that this kind of interpersonal relationship is the supreme and excellent quality in a revolutionary army, and a concrete manifestation of the spirit of revolutionary collectivism. Only the people's armed forces that have been educated by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and have undergone long-term revolutionary struggle can cultivate this excellent character of revolutionary soldiers. With such a conscious revolutionary army with revolutionary ideals in the world, there will never be a place for reactionaries, and it is destined that reactionaries will inevitably fail and ultimately die. This is the ideological foundation of the optimistic spirit of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Army. I want to sing the praises of this spirit of revolutionary collectivism and optimism. It is beneficial to educate the people with this spirit.
    How to write? What to write? Write about that period of history in the Long March? I thought for many days without getting anywhere, and I still couldn't start. After reading Chairman Mao's poem about the Long March, I felt more deeply the great spirit of the Red Army's Long March and the spirit of revolutionary optimism. I used this spirit to guide the creative thinking of the whole play. Sing the praises of the Red Army's 25,000-li Long March.
    Among the red commanders and fighters, soldiers, company commanders, buglers, orderlies, cooks, stretcher-bearers, medical orderlies, regimental commanders, division commanders, army corps commanders, and political commissars, I have many familiar faces, familiar voices, expressions, styles, and living habits in my mind. These Red Army commanders and fighters with noble qualities and a strong spirit of revolutionary sacrifice are all lovable, respectable, and thoughtful characters. I like them very much. But the higher I count, the more difficult it is to write about them. Because I am not engaged in military work after all. I am just a member of the Red Army who participated in the Long March and did literary and artistic propaganda work with the army, and I often come and go with them. As for fighting and commanding operations, I am not proficient at all. I only learned a few principles of revolutionary military thinking from books. This is my shortcoming. Although I have tried hard to collect materials from various sources, I am limited by my own level of knowledge, and what I have obtained is limited. Long-term and even longer-term efforts must be made. However, I am determined to write about the Long March from beginning to end. There is an idea in my mind: I want to write about Chairman Mao, I want to sing the praises of the heroes of the Long March. This is certain. I decided that the first step is to make the red commanders and fighters I like appear on the stage through specific events that are prominent and historically significant in the Long March, so that the audience can meet these lovable and respectable people.
    If I want to write about the great Chairman Mao, I must also write about the countless heroic figures and ordinary soldiers in the Red Army, because they were all educated by Mao Zedong Thought. I wrote about Xie Fugui in a more prominent way. This is related to my frequent remembrance of the masses in the Jiangxi base area. Xie Fugui, a new Red Army soldier and a correspondent from the Yeping Township government, has been active in my mind for a long time. He must grow up in the Long March like other soldiers. How touching it would be if he later had the opportunity to meet Chairman Mao while performing serious combat missions!
    The play "The Long March" starts with a scene featuring Chairman Mao, which has been written seventeen times. It was not until the last time that I felt there was hope for it to be put on stage. During the Long March, the Red fighters had a common saying that everyone was familiar with: "As long as we follow Chairman Mao, all difficulties can be overcome and all victories are guaranteed." The more difficult the struggle and the more serious the war, the more often these words were heard. The soldiers turned these words into unwavering confidence, and every Red fighter held this banner of victory in their hearts. How can these be concentrated and expressed in stage images? The most central point is that I want to write about the flesh-and-blood connection between Chairman Mao and the people, and between Chairman Mao and the Red fighters. For this reason, I must write a special scene. I think it is more appropriate for Chairman Mao to appear at the critical moment of seizing the dangerous crossing of the Dadu River. The meeting between the old folks in Anshunchang and the eighteen warriors with Chairman Mao arranged in the play is guided by this idea. Chairman Mao said: "Comrades, I wish you success!" This is to focus on expressing the above-mentioned meanings. I think to myself, first write this scene where Chairman Mao appears well. This is a scene that concerns the success or failure of the play. This is a serious task in creation. It has never appeared in stage images before, so be cautious, cautious, and be cautious again! After writing this scene, I turned back and wrote the prologue from the beginning. Later, the writing of each scene went smoothly. I guessed that the strength still came from the Dadu River scene.
    From the beginning of this opera, I have not been bound by anything like dramaturgical methods. I don't let the ugly faces of the enemy appear on the stage, because I don't have enough space to sing the praises of my favorite Red fighters! Why squeeze space to write about those hideous reactionaries? However, I must let the audience see that there are enemy situations and battles in every scene, and there is a determination to fight against the reactionaries. In this way, I will dedicate all the space in the opera to all kinds of Red Long March heroes and the masses in the revolutionary base areas.
    Many kind friends advised me to write a spoken drama, saying that spoken drama is more convenient and less restrictive than opera. I also admit this reason. But I can't bear to part with the Red Army songs that I can still sing to this day - the Xingguo Mountain Songs, Copper Coin Songs, Bamboo Sheet Songs, and Firewood Chopping Songs of Jiangxi. After the Red Armies from all over the country converged, I heard the soldiers of the Fourth Front Army and the Second Front Army also singing those Red Army songs that I could sing, especially "When You're a Soldier, Be a Red Army Soldier" and "The Workers and Peasants Liberation Song." I found that these songs were the common songs of the Red Armies all over the country. I love these songs. At the same time, on the way of the Long March, I taught the folk songs of Jiangxi to the soldiers of the other several front armies, and I also learned some new songs along the way, including the songs of the Yi people. I think opera is the most beautiful form of dramatic art, and it is also one of the dramatic arts that the people love the most. The Red Army's Long March is such a vibrant epic! We should sing the praises of the Long March heroes, and the deeds of the heroes themselves are a moving and great historical poem. For these reasons, I still want to write the Long March opera, and it is the most pleasant thing to sing the praises of the lovable people with the songs that the soldiers like, so I decided to do so. As for the limitations of the opera, I can't care about them.
    During the period of conception and writing of this opera, from the discussion of the outline, characters, and structure of the whole play to the completion of the script, Comrade Yu Cun and Comrade Haixiao have always been cooperating with me. After I finished writing, I gave it to them for reading and modification, and then I finalized the draft. They, especially Comrade Yu Cun, did important creative work for the opera, making the structure of the script compact and more operatic, and more suitable for the composer's requirements. In addition, I also asked many teachers to guide me. Regarding military issues, I consulted Comrade Nie Rongzhen, Comrade Xiao Hua, Comrade Chen Xilian, and Comrade Li Tao the most. Otherwise, I would not be able to issue combat orders. Without the help of Comrade Xi Lian in the last frontal battle, I would not be able to write it at all. Regarding the affairs of drama and literature creation, I consulted Mr. Lao She and Mr. Cao Yu, and exchanged opinions on everything from structure to characters. The conception time was very long. Sometimes I simply recited the drafts to them. They said, "It's a bit interesting!" I was happy in my heart, especially the Dadu River scene. I recited it to them more than once, and they all said, "It's done!" I was relieved.
    The fact that "The Long March" can be put on stage like this today is entirely the result of the help of collective strength. There must be places that are not written well enough, mainly due to the limitations of my political and artistic cultivation. At the same time, the fact that "The Long March" can meet the audience means that my shortcomings can be corrected through mass criticism and the correction of cadres who participated in the Long March and have military qualities, and can be more supplemented, revised, and improved. I never imagined that such a great epic as the Long March could be written in one go. This is only the first performance version. Only through continuous rewriting and revision, ten times, or even dozens of times, can it be perfected.
    I would like to dedicate this not-very-mature and still-immature Long March opera to the 30th anniversary of the founding of our Party and to our dear Chairman Mao, and to the 24th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.
                                              Night of July 24th in Beijing

　　我怎样写《长征》
    李伯钊
    想写《长征》这史诗的志愿，我在几年以前就有了，但前后只不过陆续记载了一些片断的史料，总动不了笔。从去年七月起，请了三个月的假，我才着手整理长征资料，研究已出版的长征故事、通讯、剧作等，并作写《长征》的种种准备。
    我写作《长征》的动机是什么呢？什么力量推动我非写它不可呢？回想起来，因为我在红军中这么多年，感受最深的有两点：第一，红军是工农的儿子，自愿来当兵的。他们都参加了打土豪分田地的政治斗争，获得了革命的利益。这支军队的特质，表现在它与群众如鱼得水的关系上，它走到那里，那里的群众就欢迎它，拥护它。第二，在红军队伍里面，非常显著的有着说不出来的那么好的一种人同人的关系，和可爱的作风。士兵爱士兵，士兵爱官长，官长爱士兵；下级爱上级，下级指挥员尊敬上级指挥员，自觉的服从命令；而上级指挥员和下级干部对战斗员的爱护体贴，关心政治的教养，使全军完全在政治思想上，活泼精神中，纯真的同志关系中，融成一体。无论谁的英雄行为，成绩缺点，疾病痛苦，伤亡损失，都是集体所关心的事件。任何人的行动离不开集体。他们有共同的革命理想。因此，这支军队就能够无敌于天下了。不管在什么艰难环境下，不管有多么强大的敌人，打不散，冲不垮它。反之，如果敌人要想伸出一个指头，敢来动一下任何红色指战员的话，全体红色指战员会奋不顾身的来捍卫自己的亲人，他们一定要集中力量把敌人的指头斩掉。集体的利益，是红军一切行动的准绳。红军就是这样富有革命理想的军队。我以为这种人与人的关系，是革命军队中至高无尚的优良品质，是革命集体主义精神的具体表现。只有受过马列主义毛泽东思想教育，受过长期革命斗争锻炼的人民武装，才可能培养出这种革命军人的优良品格。世界上有了这种具有革命理想、自觉的革命军队，就永远没有反动派的地位，就注定了反动派必然永远失败和最后的死亡。这就是中国人民革命军队乐观主义精神的思想基础。我要歌颂这种革命的集体主义和乐观主义的精神。用这种精神来教育人民是有益的。
    怎么写？写些什么？写长征中的那一段史实？思索许多时日不得要领，还是一样动不了手。我熟读毛主席咏长征的诗以后，使我更深刻的感觉，红军长征的伟大气魄，和革命的乐观主义的精神。我就用这种精神指导全剧创作思想。歌颂红军二万五千里长征。
    红色指挥员战斗员的人物中，战士、连长、司号员、勤务员、炊事员、担架员、卫生员、团长、师长、军团长、政委，在我心中有许多熟识的面孔，熟悉的声音、表情、作风及生活习惯等等。这些具有高贵品质、顽强的革命牺牲的精神的红军指战员，个个都是可爱的，使人尊敬的，富有思想的人物，我非常喜爱他们。但越往上数，要写出他们来，确越有困难。因为我倒底不是做军事工作的，我只不过是参加红军长征中的一员，随军做文艺宣传工作，同他们常来常往。至于打仗的事，指挥作战等等，我一点不内行。革命的军事思想，仅从书本上读会几条原理原则，这正是我的短处，虽曾努力多方搜集材料，限于自己的知识水平，所得有限，非作长期的、更长期努力不可。不过我自立愿，要写长征，从头到底，有一个思想在活动：我要写毛主席，我要歌颂长征英雄，这是确定的，我决定第一步，先把我所喜欢的红色指挥员战斗员，通过长征中突出的富有历史意义的具体事件，使他们的形象出现在舞台上，让观众和这些可爱可敬的人物见面。
    我要写伟大的毛主席也就要写红军中无数的英雄人物，平凡的战士，因为他们都是毛泽东思想教养出来的。我较突出的写了谢富贵。这同我经常怀念江西根据地的群众有关系的。红军新战士谢富贵，叶坪乡政府的通讯员，这个人物很早就在我脑子里活动。他必须在长征中跟其他战士一样锻炼成长起来，后来他有机会和毛主席在执行严重作战任务时见面，该是多么令人感动的啊！
    《长征》这剧本，是从毛主席出现的一场写起的，前后写了十七遍，直到最后一遍才觉得搬上舞台有了希望。长征的时候，红色战斗员有一句众人都熟悉的共同的语言：“只要跟着毛主席，一切困难能度过，一切胜利有把握。”越是斗争艰巨和战争严重关头，这些话随处听到，战士们把这些话变成坚定不移的信心，每个红色指战员心中竖着这面胜利的旗帜。这些怎么集中在舞台形象上来表现呢？最中心的一点，我要写毛主席与老百姓，毛主席与红色战斗员的血肉关联。为了这个，我一定要专门写一场戏。我以为毛主席在抢渡大渡河天险的关头出现较合适，剧中安排的安顺场老乡和十八勇士与毛主席的会见，是受这种思想指导的。主席说：“同志们，祝你们成功！”就是要集中表现上面说的这些意思。我自己这样想，首先写好毛主席出现这一场，这是关乎剧本成败的一场，这是创作上一个严肃的任务，后来在舞台形象上没有出现过的，要谨慎、谨慎、再谨慎！写成了这场才翻回从头里写序幕。以后各场写起来还顺利，那力量我揣摸还是从大渡河一场来的。
    这歌剧自打开始，我就不受什么剧作法之类的东西的束缚。我不叫敌人的丑相出现在舞台上，因为我专用来歌颂我喜爱的红色指战员的篇幅还不够呢！干吗挤篇幅去写那些面目狰狞的反动派呢？但是，我必得叫观众能看出场场有敌情，有战斗，对反动派有斗争决心。我就这样把歌剧所有的篇幅专留给各色各样的红色长征英雄，和革命根据地的群众了。
    许多好心的朋友劝我写话剧，说话剧比歌剧方便，限制性少些。这理由我也是承认的。但我舍不得我至今会唱的那些红军歌——江西的兴国山歌、铜钱歌、竹片歌、砍柴歌等。在全国红军会合后，我听见四方面军、二方面军也唱我会唱的那些红军歌，特别是《当兵就要当红军》和《工农解放歌》。我发现这些歌就是全国红军共通的歌声，我爱这些歌。同时，在长征的一路上，我把江西的民歌通教会了其它几个方面军的战士，沿途又学会一些新的歌，包括彝人的歌等等。我以为歌剧是戏剧艺术中最优美的形式，也是人民最喜爱的戏剧艺术的一种。红军长征，是多么富有生命力的史诗啊！应该歌唱长征英雄，而英雄们的事迹本身就是一首动人的伟大历史的诗歌。就为这些理由，我还是要写长征歌剧，用战士们欢喜的歌曲，来歌颂可爱的人们是一件最愉快不过的事情，就决心这样做了。至于歌剧的限制性就顾不得了。
    这个歌剧的写作酝酿期间，从讨论全剧的梗概、人物、结构，一直到剧本完成，我和于村同志、海啸同志始终是合作的。我写成后交他们二人阅读修改，然后再由我定稿。他们，特别是于村同志，替歌剧做了重要的创作工作，使剧本的结构紧凑和更歌剧化，更适合于作曲者的要求。另外，我还请了许多老师指导我。军事方面的问题，我请教最多的是聂荣臻同志、萧华同志、陈锡联同志、李涛同志，否则，作战命令我也不会下；最后一场正面战斗如无锡联同志的帮助，简直写不出来。戏剧文学创作方面的事情，我请教老舍和曹禺两位先生，从结构到人物都交换过意见。酝酿时间很长，有时我索性把腹稿念给他们听，他们说：“有点意思了！”我心里就高兴，特别是大渡河一场，我不只一遍地背给他们听，他们都说：“成了！”我才放心。
    《长征》能像今天这个样子搬上舞台，完全是集体力量帮助的结果。一定有写得不够的地方，主要是由于我的政治和艺术修养的限制所致。同时，《长征》能与观众见面，使我之所短，经过群众的批评，和参加长征富有军事素养的干部同志们校正，可以得到更多的补充、修正和改进。我从来也没有设想，像长征这样伟大的史诗，一次就能把它写成，这仅作第一期的演出本，只有经过不断改写修正，十遍，以至数十遍，才能臻于完善。
    谨将这不十分成熟，尚还幼稚的长征歌剧，献给我党成立的三十周年纪念和亲爱的毛主席，献给人民解放军建军二十四周年纪念。
