Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 13th: The Politburo of the French Communist Party held a meeting on August 9th, presided over by Duclos. The meeting passed a resolution on the formation of a new government by Pleven, stating: "The National Assembly's debate on authorizing Pleven to form a cabinet confirms that all groups, from Mollet to De Gaulle, essentially agree to force France to accept the Atlantic Pact policy favored by American billionaires." The resolution further stated: There are not two opposition factions in the parliament, but two policies. One is the policy of subservience to US demands, which is adhered to by those from the Socialist Party to the French People's Rally; the other is a French policy representing the wishes of people from all walks of life across the country, which is what the French Communist Party parliamentary group defends on the rostrum of the National Assembly.

The resolution emphasized that the workers of France "are determined to use effective means to force the National Assembly and the government to meet their basic demands and ensure satisfactory living conditions for all workers. This method is for the working class and all lower-level Republicans to unite and force the National Assembly's violent reactionary majority and the government to accept policies that safeguard peace, defend national independence, and promote social welfare."

　　法共政治局就普利文组阁通过决议
    谴责议会反动多数执行服从美国要求的政策
    号召工人加强团结迫使法政府满足人民要求
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党政治局于八月九日在杜克洛主持下开会。会上就普利文组成新政府一事通过决议说：“国民议会关于授权普利文组阁的辩论，证实了从摩勒到戴高乐这一切集团，本质上都同意强制法国接受美国亿万富翁所喜欢的大西洋公约政策。”决议又说：议会中存在的不是两个反对派，而是两种政策，一种是服从美国要求的政策，从社会党到法兰西人民联盟这一派人都坚持这种政策；另一种是代表全国各阶层人民愿望的法国政策，法国共产党议会党团在国民议会讲坛上所捍卫的，就是这种政策。
    决议着重指出：法国的劳动者“决心以有效的办法迫使国民议会与政府满足他们的基本要求，并保证一切劳动者获得满意的生活条件。这个办法就是工人阶级与所有下层的共和分子团结起来，迫使国民议会狂暴的反动多数和政府接受维护和平、保卫国家独立与增进社会福利的政策。”
