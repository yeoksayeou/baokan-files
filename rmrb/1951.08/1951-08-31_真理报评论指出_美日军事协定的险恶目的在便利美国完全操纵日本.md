　　*Pravda* Commentary Points Out

　　The Sinister Purpose of the U.S.-Japan Military Agreement is to Facilitate Complete U.S. Manipulation of Japan

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 30th] According to TASS, Moscow, August 28th: Regarding the Japanese peace treaty conference to be held in San Francisco on September 4th, *Pravda* commentator Lasadin pointed out the fact that foreign bourgeois newspapers are particularly enthusiastic about publishing the draft of the so-called U.S.-Japan "Security Agreement." Lasadin said: If people see that this American-made agreement will be signed immediately after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, it will be very clear that the measures stipulated in the U.S.-Japan military agreement constitute a part of the U.S. policy towards Japan. From the content of this agreement that has been published, it is very clear that this is a military conspiracy between U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism. This agreement does not stipulate a definite term for the stationing of American troops in Japan, which indicates that the United States wants to conceal its attempt to occupy Japan for a long time. All the clauses of this agreement are aimed at ensuring that American imperialists have the opportunity to unscrupulously control everything in Japan.

　　Lasadin continued: The purpose of the U.S.-Japan military agreement is to continue and expand the policy of reviving Japanese militarism under U.S. control. The military agreement forced upon Japan itself shows that the United States has once again blatantly violated the international agreements it has signed, first of all the Potsdam Proclamation signed on July 26, 1945, which stipulated the withdrawal of foreign troops from Japan.

　　真理报评论指出
    美日军事协定的险恶目的在便利美国完全操纵日本
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科八月二十八日讯：关于九月四日将在旧金山举行的对日和约会议，真理报评论员拉萨丁指出一个事实，即外国资产阶级报纸特别热心刊登所谓美日“安全协定”的草案。拉萨丁说：假如人们看到这个美制的协定将在对日和约签字后即行签订，那就很清楚地看出：美日军事协定中所规定的措施是构成美国对日政策的一部分。从这个协定已经发表的内容看来，很清楚地，这是美帝国主义者和日本军国主义者的军事阴谋。这个协定没有规定美国军队驻扎日本的确定期限，这就表示美国想要掩盖它长久占领日本的企图。这个协定的一切条文都是在于保证美帝国主义者在日本有肆无忌惮把持一切的机会。
    拉萨丁继续说：美日军事协定的目的是在继续与扩展在美国控制之下复活日本军国主义的政策。强迫日本签订的军事协定本身，就表明美国又一次悍然违犯它自己签订的国际协定，首先违犯了一九四五年七月二十六日签订的波茨坦公告，这个公告曾规定从日本撤退外国军队。
