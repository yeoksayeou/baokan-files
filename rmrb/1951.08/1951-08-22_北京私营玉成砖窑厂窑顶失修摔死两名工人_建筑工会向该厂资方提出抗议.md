To the Editor:

Two workers, Zhang Qi and Wu Yueming, at the private Yucheng Brick Factory outside Zu’anmen in Beijing, fell into the kiln on the afternoon of July 27 when the old and dilapidated kiln roof collapsed while they were working. The two workers were badly injured by the fall and the heat, and died one after the other in the hospital despite being rushed there for treatment. After this incident, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau and the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Construction Union sent people to the site for inspection and to investigate the cause of the accident. It is understood that this accident was caused by the Yucheng Brick Factory's serious neglect of worker safety and its refusal to accept workers' opinions. Some time ago, after the accident at the Jian’guo No. 2 Factory (also a brick factory) in which a worker was killed, the Brick and Tile Industry District Working Committee of the Beijing Municipal Construction Union Preparatory Committee assisted various factories in inspecting safety equipment. At that time, the workers of the Yucheng Brick Factory suggested that the kiln was too old and should be repaired or reinforced. However, the foreman of the kiln replied, "Let's fire two more kilns." A section of the outer wall of the kiln had previously collapsed, but instead of repairing it from the foundation, it was patched up from where it had collapsed, causing the wall to lean inward by more than a foot. Moreover, the passageway on top of the kiln was too narrow, requiring two people to hold onto each other to walk. The walkway on top of the kiln was also too narrow for even one person to stand on. The workers had raised these issues, but the factory owner refused to accept them.

The conditions in the Yucheng Brick Factory workers' dormitory are also very poor. The west wall of one dormitory leans inward by more than a foot, and the wall of the mill has cracks more than an inch wide, with daylight visible through the corners of the pillars. Two new dormitories are less than seven feet high, the rafters are only half an inch thick and spaced more than a foot apart, and there are no windows, only a broken fence on the door. The other two dormitories have only four pillars that are two inches thick, four thin purlins, and walls and pillars that are leaning and crooked, posing a constant risk of collapse, making the workers uneasy. This situation shows that the factory owner does not pay much attention to the safety of the workers.

The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Construction Union has lodged a strong protest against the Yucheng Brick Factory's neglect of worker safety, and demanded that the factory provide the deceased's family with the compensation they are entitled to under the collective labor contract, and that the kiln and dormitory be repaired as soon as possible. The factory owner has now accepted the union's demands, prepared coffins to bury the deceased, and paid each family of the deceased a compensation of four million yuan. The issue of responsibility for the accident will be referred to the People's Court by the union.

(Editor's Note) Oppose Neglecting Workers’ Lives, Safety and Health!

The acts of the private Yongli Chemical Company factory in Tanggu and the private Yucheng Brick Factory in Beijing in neglecting the safety and health of workers violate the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital in the Common Program. Today, there are still a few capitalists who pay no attention to the safety and health equipment of factories, allowing workers to work in extremely harsh conditions, seriously damaging the health of workers, and even causing unnecessary casualties. This not only directly harms the interests of workers, but also has adverse consequences for the owners. The Yongli Chemical Company factory and the Yucheng Brick Factory should learn their lesson, immediately improve safety and health equipment, and pay attention to protecting the health of workers. The resulting casualties, such as the death of workers in the Yucheng Brick Factory due to the collapse of the kiln roof, should be subject to sanctions by the People's Government law.

### 北京私营玉成砖窑厂窑顶失修摔死两名工人  建筑工会向该厂资方提出抗议

　　北京私营玉成砖窑厂窑顶失修摔死两名工人
    建筑工会向该厂资方提出抗议
    编辑同志：
    七月二十七日下午，北京左安门外私营玉成砖窑厂工人张起、吴月明二人在窑顶工作时，因为窑旧失修，窑帮垮下一块，掉在窑内。此两工人掉下以后，连烫带摔，伤势很重，虽经送往医院救治，但先后都死在医院了。这件事发生后，北京市人民政府劳动局和北京市建筑工会筹备委员会，都派人亲临现场检查，并研究事故发生的原因。据悉，这次事故，是由于玉成砖窑厂资方，严重忽视工人安全，不接受工人意见所引起的。前些日子，建国二厂（也是砖窑厂）发生砸死工人事故后，北京市建筑工会砖窑业区工作委员会，曾帮助各厂检查安全设备，当时玉成砖窑厂工人提出意见，说窑太旧了，应当修理或加固。但是窑上的工头却回答说：“烧两窑再说吧。”该窑外墙曾垮下一处，当时也没有从根底上修理，而是从垮了的地方补砌起来的，结果使墙向里斜进去一尺多。而且该窑上面的走道太窄，两人上去，得互相牵引着走。窑顶上的盘道也太窄，连一个人也站不下，这些事情，工人都曾提出过意见，可是资方却不接受。
    玉成砖窑厂工人宿舍的情况也很坏。有一处宿舍的西墙歪进一尺多，磨房的墙裂有一寸多宽的缝子，柱角地方都透了天。有两间新宿舍，还不够七尺高，椽子只有半寸粗，并且隔着一尺多远一根，窗户一个也没有，门上装着一个破栅栏。另两间宿舍，只有二寸粗的柱子四根，四根细檩，墙斜柱子歪，随时都有倒塌的危险，工人住着都不放心。这种情况，说明该厂资方对工人安全问题，是很不注意的。
    北京市建筑工会筹备委员会，对玉成砖窑厂这种忽视工人安全的行为，已提出严正抗议，并要求该厂按劳资集体合同给死者家属以应得的补助，砖窑和宿舍应修理的地方赶快修理。现在资方已接受工会要求，准备棺材安葬死者，并发给死者家属每家四百万元的补助金。事故责任问题将由工会申请人民法院判处。

　　反对忽视工人生命安全和健康！（编者按）
    塘沽私营永利化学公司所属工厂和北京私营玉成砖窑厂忽视工人生命安全和健康的行为，是违反共同纲领劳资两利原则的。今天，还有少数资本家对工厂的安全卫生设备毫不注意，让工人在极端恶劣的劳动条件下工作，严重地损害了工人的健康，甚至发生了不应有的伤亡事故。这不但直接危害工人利益，其结果对资方也将是不利的。永利化学公司所属工厂及玉成砖窑厂应接受教训，立即改善安全卫生设备，注意保护工人健康。其已经造成的伤亡事故，如玉成砖窑厂因窑顶失修而摔死工人等，资方应该受到人民政府法律的制裁。
