Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Pyongyang, Tass: The *Workers' Daily* published an editorial commenting on the various provocative actions of the U.S. interventionist troops during the Kaesong armistice negotiations, stating: "During the days of the negotiations, the U.S. Air Force intensified its bandit-like air raids on peaceful cities and villages in Korea, bombing and strafing locations that had nothing to do with military targets, and killing many civilians. Moreover, the U.S. Air Force has repeatedly violated China's airspace, dropping bombs on Chinese residential areas. All of these are actions planned by those who launched the aggression against our country."

"On the eve of the negotiations, Ridgway personally ordered the mobilization of U.S. and puppet troops. After the troop movements, the interventionist troops launched active military operations that were clearly provocative and are still continuing. This situation is by no means accidental."

"People will naturally ask: Why did the U.S. government take such actions devoid of any peaceful intent after ordering Ridgway to begin armistice negotiations? There can only be one explanation: The interventionist troops suffered heavy losses, and the U.S. government was forced to begin armistice negotiations under pressure from peace-loving people around the world; however, it does not actually hope to establish peace in Korea and is therefore inciting war. The U.S. side's refusal to withdraw U.S. troops from Korea and the U.S. Air Force's attacks on cities and villages in both Korea and China clearly demonstrate this. All this proves once again the U.S. government's aggressive intentions. The U.S. side needs war because war is a source of huge profits for U.S. monopoly capitalists."

"Our people are united in their determination to defend the peace, unity, glory, and independence of the motherland; no provocative activities by the U.S. warmongers can destroy their will. The people of the world place their hopes on the Kaesong negotiations. The Korean side is doing its utmost to ensure the smooth progress of the negotiations, in order to live up to the wishes of peace-loving countries around the world; however, the U.S. representatives are using various methods to hinder the smooth progress of the negotiations. This once again shows who wants peace and who wants war."

Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: The Vietnamese News Agency published an editorial on July 30 commenting on the Korean armistice negotiations, stating: "The delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers has consistently demonstrated a sincere desire for peace in the negotiations. However, in order to maintain the huge profits from selling oil, guns, and tanks, the U.S. imperialists are doing their best to undermine the current armistice negotiations in Kaesong." The editorial pointed out: "The U.S. side has consistently lacked sincerity in the negotiations. Not only have they refused to discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops, but while negotiating, they continue to indiscriminately bomb peaceful cities and towns in Korea, and now they refuse to fairly and reasonably resolve the issue of the military demarcation line."

The editorial said: "Whether peace can be restored in Korea is not a matter to be decided by the U.S. imperialists. The decisive factors in resolving this issue are the combined strength and vigilance of the Korean and Chinese peoples, who are fully prepared to deal with all the aggressors' conspiracies and tricks."

The editorial concluded: "The Vietnamese people wholeheartedly support the peaceful stance of the Korean and Chinese delegations. They are determined to do everything possible to step up production, work harder and fight the French colonial army to support the Kaesong armistice negotiations."

### 朝鲜《劳动新闻》  斥美干涉军煽动战火  越通讯社指出美方缺乏和平诚意

　　朝鲜《劳动新闻》
    斥美干涉军煽动战火
    越通讯社指出美方缺乏和平诚意
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社平壤三十日讯：《劳动新闻》发表社论，评论开城停战谈判期间美国干涉军的种种挑衅行动说：在谈判的日子里，美国空军加紧对朝鲜和平城市和乡村进行强盗般的空袭，轰炸并扫射和军事目标毫无关系的地点，杀害了许多老百姓。而且，美国空军还曾数次侵犯中国的领空，在中国居民区投掷炸弹。所有这一些都是那些发动对我国的侵略的人们所策划好的行动。
    李奇微在谈判前夕亲自下令调动美军和伪军，在军队调动以后，干涉军就发动了显然带有挑衅性质的积极军事行动，并且目前还在继续。这种情形决不是偶然的。
    人们当然会问：美国政府在下令李奇微开始停战谈判以后，为什么还要采取这种毫无和平的意思的行动呢？这只能有一个解释，那就是：干涉军受了惨重的损失，美国政府在全世界爱好和平的人民的压力下不得不开始停战谈判；但是，它实际上并不希望在朝鲜建立和平，因此又在煽动战火。美国方面拒绝从朝鲜撤退美国军队和美国空军袭击朝中两国的城市和乡村，清楚地证明了这一点。这一切再度证明美国政府的侵略意图。美国方面需要战争，因为战争是美国垄断资本家搜刮巨额利润的来源。
    我国人民一致决心维护祖国的和平、统一、光荣和独立；美国战争贩子的任何挑衅活动决不能摧毁他们的意志。全世界人民把他们的希望寄托在开城谈判上。朝鲜方面正竭尽全力使谈判顺利进行，以不负爱好和平的各国人民的愿望；而美国代表却用种种办法阻挠谈判的顺利进展。这再一次地说明谁要和平，谁要战争。
    【新华社一日讯】越南通讯社七月三十日发表社论，评论朝鲜停战谈判问题称：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团在谈判中一贯表现了愿望和平的诚意。但是，美帝国主义者为了要保持贩卖石油、枪炮和坦克的巨额利润，他们正尽力破坏目前在开城的停战谈判。社论指出：美国方面在谈判中一贯表现缺乏诚意。他们不仅拒绝讨论撤退外国军队的问题，一面谈判一面继续滥炸朝鲜的和平城乡，而且现在又拒绝公平合理地解决军事分界线的问题。
    社论说：朝鲜的和平能不能恢复，不是一个由美帝国主义者来决定的问题。解决这个问题的决定性的因素是朝鲜人民和中国人民的联合力量和警觉，他们已有充分的准备来应付侵略者的一切阴谋诡计。
    社论结语说：越南人民衷心支持朝中代表团的和平立场，他们决心尽一切力量加紧生产，更加努力和法国殖民军作战，来支持开城停战谈判。
