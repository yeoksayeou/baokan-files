　　Correct the Tendency to Neglect the Work of Democratic Regime Building!
　　Ying County, Chahar Province, Neglects the Democratic Rights of People's Representatives

　　Ying County, Chahar Province, convened its Third and Fourth People's Representative Conferences in November 1950 and March 1951, respectively. The two conferences played a certain role in promoting work. However, due to the serious neglect of the democratic rights of the people's representatives by the county leadership, many errors and deviations occurred.

　　The main agenda of the Third Conference was to discuss the county's winter work and elect the Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference. Due to insufficient and careless preparation in advance, a special agent under surveillance was actually invited as a special representative (he was later screened out). The conference was originally scheduled to officially open at 9:00 am on December 9th, but nearly half of the representatives did not arrive. Without consulting with the Standing Committee, the leadership only held a cadre meeting and decided to postpone the opening for half a day. During the opening ceremony, 38 representatives (accounting for 22% of the total number of representatives) were still absent. The master of ceremonies, without consulting the presidium, announced that "representatives who are absent without reason should have their representative qualifications revoked," which was immediately passed in an uproar. Later, one representative suggested that "they should be investigated and dealt with separately," and only then was a more cautious vote taken. When the conference was passing resolutions, a young representative raised the issues of "financial difficulties in people's schools and the problem of reforming smokers." The master of ceremonies actually replied, "There are other regulations." The atmosphere at the meeting was depressed at the time, and it was only corrected after the executive chairman explained. The county only considered this illegal action of the master of ceremonies exceeding his authority as "there was a lack of propriety in promoting democracy" and did not strictly examine and punish it. In addition, the executive chairmen of the conference were all responsible cadres from the county, without representatives from all walks of life. More cadres attended the meeting than representatives, and most of the cadres did not consult and discuss issues with the representatives very well; in addition, there were many reports and little deliberation, so many representatives could not remember what was said and only mechanically raised their hands. The county did not deeply investigate and examine the above-mentioned illegal acts and incorrect leadership methods that did not respect the people's democratic rights, nor did it learn from the lessons. Therefore, many mistakes were still made during the Fourth Conference, such as the notices still being sent very late, making it difficult for some representatives to attend; proposals were not collected in advance, so there were only eight proposals; at the same time, a cadre attending the meeting was nominated to the presidium (and later withdrew); some district cadres adopted the method of leading village cadres when discussing issues, "urging" representatives to speak, etc., which further illustrates that the county's understanding of convening the People's Representative Conference is extremely vague, and there is a serious "privilege" mentality among the leading organs and cadres, disregarding the democratic rights of the people. This error must be quickly corrected not only by the county, but also deserves to be taken as a warning by other regions.

　　纠正忽视民主政权建设工作的偏向！
    察哈尔省应县忽视人民代表的民主权利
    察哈尔省应县于一九五○年十一月和一九五一年三月先后召开了第三次和第四次各界人民代表会议，两次会议在推动工作方面，曾有一定的作用。但由于该县领导上严重地忽视人民代表的民主权利，曾发生了很多错误偏向。
    第三次会议主要议程是讨论该县冬季工作，选举各界人民代表会议常务委员会。事先因准备工作不充分，不认真，竟将被管制的特务分子聘为特邀代表（后来把他审查出去）。这次会议原定于十二月九日上午正式开会，代表有近半数未来，领导上未经和常委会商量，只开了个干部会，就决定停开半天。在进行大会仪式的时候，仍有三十八名代表（占代表总数的百分之二十二）缺席，司仪未经过主席团竟宣布“无故不到会的代表应取消代表资格”，当即一哄通过，后来有一个代表提出“应审查后再分别处理”，才又慎重表决。大会通过决议时，一个青年代表提出：“民校经费困难问题和改造烟民问题。”司仪竟答复：“另有规定。”当时会场消沉，后来执行主席作了解释，才纠正过来。这种司仪超越职权的非法行动，该县仅认为是“发扬民主有欠妥的地方”，并未严格检讨议处。另外，大会的执行主席全是县里负责干部，没有各界代表。会议列席干部多于出席代表，干部多半不很好地和代表们协商讨论问题；加以报告多，酝酿少，致使很多代表记不清讲的什么，只是机械地举手。以上这些不尊重人民民主权利的违法的行为和不正确的领导方式，该县并未深查检讨，吸取教训，所以在第四次会议时仍犯了许多错误，如因通知仍发的很迟，有些代表难于出席；事先未搜集提案，所以提案仅有八件；同时会议上把一列席干部提选为主席团（后来才退出）；有些区干部讨论问题时则采取领导村干部的方式，“督促”代表发言等，更说明该县对召开人民代表会议认识上极为模糊，在领导机关和干部中间存在着严重漠视人民民主权利的“特权”思想。这种错误不仅该县须迅速纠正，并值得各地引以为戒。
