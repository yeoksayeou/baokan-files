[Our Dispatch] Beijing Military Control Commission Military Law Department sentenced a batch of counter-revolutionary criminals yesterday (22nd). The breakdown is as follows: 237 counter-revolutionary criminals were sentenced to death and executed immediately; 25 were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve; 25 were sentenced to life imprisonment; 128 were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment; and 3 were sentenced to release. The counter-revolutionary criminals sentenced to death and executed immediately were executed by firing squad yesterday afternoon.

The Beijing Municipal People's Government recently continued to clear 418 counter-revolutionary cases. After repeated and thorough investigation and interrogation by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, cases familiar to the local masses or related to them were submitted to the masses for discussion, and their opinions on how to handle them were solicited. Based on the opinions of the masses, the above-mentioned organs further corrected and reviewed these cases, drafted preliminary handling opinions, and submitted them to the joint meeting of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee and the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference Consultative Committee for group-by-group review. The Public Security Bureau then submitted the cases to the Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission for trial. Based on the Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, the Military Law Department sentenced or released these 418 counter-revolutionary criminals according to the seriousness of their crimes against national interests and the degree of public indignation.

Among the 237 counter-revolutionary criminals sentenced to death and executed immediately, there were 125 secret agents, 9 traitors, 28 local bullies, 9 habitual bandits, 27 ringleaders of reactionary secret societies, 16 members of reactionary home return corps, and 23 Chiang Kai-shek bandits, puppet soldiers, and police. The vast majority of them are determined counter-revolutionaries with blood debts. At least 1,392 Communist Party members, democratic figures, and progressive people have been found to have been personally killed or planned and directed to be killed by these counter-revolutionary criminals. Sun Tianzhang, a Central Statistics Bureau (CSB) agent, directly or indirectly killed more than 40 revolutionary cadres and masses in Shandong. Jiang Tian, a Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) agent, arrested 19 of our underground revolutionary personnel of the Changxindian Railway Committee in 1948 and killed more than 10 revolutionary cadres. Yang Bichen, deputy director of the concentration camp of the Puppet Northeast Security Commander's Office, used cruel freezing and starvation methods to abuse captured soldiers, resulting in more than 800 deaths. Kang Juncai, a puppet army platoon leader, even dug out people's hearts and stir-fried them after killing them.

Another category is secret agents who have been engaged in counter-revolution as a profession for a long time. They have five, ten, or even twenty years of counter-revolutionary history and have received three or four specialized agent training courses. Although some of them have not directly killed anyone, the number of revolutionary cadres and patriotic people brutally killed under their planning, leadership, or organization is incalculable. They stole our military and political intelligence, trained agents for Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and sabotaged the student and worker movements. Their harm to the people's revolutionary cause is very serious. For example, Zhu Huandou, a CSB agent, had 20 years of counter-revolutionary history, trained more than 500 agents for Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, closed the Chongqing Xinhua Daily, and created the Chongqing Cangbaitang and Jiaochangkou massacres. Wang Lingyun, an MIB agent, sent agents to sneak into Anshan City to spy on our military intelligence, and the bandit army took the opportunity to invade, causing serious losses to our Anshan garrison and the people. Ding Yizhi, an MIB agent, served as the warden of the Zhazidong and Puppet Beiping Cannon Bureau Detention Center of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization. In 1948, he participated in the "August 19th" mass arrest in Beijing and personally issued summonses to arrest progressive students from various schools. Jin Jixuan, an MIB agent, was the murderer who suppressed the "December 9th" student movement 15 years ago and buried alive six patriotic students and revolutionary cadres in Jixian County.

The third category is secret agents who continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, refusing to repent. They secretly set up radio stations to send intelligence to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, infiltrated our internal affairs to spy on state secrets, and organized armed riots in an attempt to subvert the people's regime. For example, Chen Hao, an MIB agent, sneaked into our army after liberation, incited soldiers to desert, and plotted to kill cadres. Lu Jieyin, an MIB agent, received radio stations, funds, and codes in Beijing when it was besieged, attempting to lie dormant and conspire to steal our military and political intelligence. Chen Yaping, an MIB agent, developed reactionary landlords and scattered soldiers after liberation, organized reactionary organizations such as the so-called "United Nations Army Headquarters Intelligence Office China Intelligence Command Pingjin Command" and the "Jidong Commando,"妄想配合美蒋“反攻大陆”，实行暴乱。妄想配合美蒋“反攻大陆”，实行暴乱。Wen Tianhe, an MIB agent, organized the "Yunnan, Vietnam, Burma, Thailand Border Anti-Communist Army" after liberation in an attempt to harass our border defenses.

The fourth category is the ringleaders of reactionary secret societies. They committed heinous crimes before liberation and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after liberation, confronting the People's Government. For example, Zhao Sizhang, the person in charge of the Outer East Group of Yiguan Tao, was a trusted liaison of Zhang Wufu, the head of Yiguan Tao in Beijing, and hid and sheltered Zhang Wufu's escape after liberation. Li Cai, the head of the Jiugong Tao, developed more than 600,000 followers before liberation and continued to swindle followers and plot to organize riots after liberation.

The fifth category is local bullies. Relying on reactionary forces, they dominated one side, humiliated the masses, and harmed the people, owing many blood debts and causing great public indignation. For example, 28 local bullies forced 48 people to death or beat them to death. The local bully landlords Zhao Fuchen and Zhao Zhendong, father and son, dominated the Huangsi Building area for more than 30 years, forcing 13 people to death. Jiang Zhong's family property and women were occupied by them, and Jiang Zhong and his son were forced to death.

The sixth category is big traitors who colluded with Japanese imperialism, betrayed the motherland, and sold out national interests. For example, Du Xijun served as the Director of the Puppet Security Headquarters and the General Commander of the Puppet North China Pacification Army. He participated in the signing of the Twenty-One Demands, a traitorous treaty between the Yuan Shikai government and Japanese imperialism, and later promoted the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" traitorous policy and fought against our army more than 120 times.

The seventh category is habitual bandits. They refused to repent after liberation, repeatedly committed robberies, and seriously endangered the safety of people's lives and property. For example, Zhang Wenyuan, a habitual bandit, committed seven robberies with accomplices in the Moshikou area after liberation.

The last category is the home return corps. They were all determined counter-revolutionaries who continuously harassed the liberated areas before liberation, carried out "anti-liquidation struggles," sabotaged land reform, brutally killed peasants, and plundered the fruits of the peasants' victory. For example, Liu Wenyuan of the "Liu Family Five Tigers" in Mentougou, participated in the White Hoop Home Return Corps as a squad leader, participated in the counter-settlement, and seized 25 mu of land, 3 coal kilns, 6 cattle and horses, and more than 20 shi of grain from the peasants. Another example is Liu Diyuan, who beat peasant Sun Guo to death.

In addition, some other counter-revolutionary criminals, according to the Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, also deserved to be sentenced to death, but because they did not owe blood debts, or public indignation was not great, or the damage to national interests did not reach the most serious level, so according to the principles instructed by Chairman Mao, they were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve and forced labor to see the effect.

Counter-revolutionary criminals sentenced to life or fixed-term imprisonment had their sentence lengths determined according to the severity of their crimes. During the execution period, they are forced to work and undergo reform education.

Finally, counter-revolutionary criminals sentenced to release were those who committed minor crimes, or had meritorious service, or had concrete manifestations of repentance and rehabilitation after liberation. The Military Law Department has ordered them to be released on bail.

　　北京市继续清理反革命案件四百余件
    处决反革命罪犯二百余名
    另一百八十一名罪犯分别判刑或释放
    【本报讯】北京市军事管制委员会军法处于昨（二十二）日判决反革命罪犯一批，计：判处死刑立即执行的反革命罪犯共二百三十七名；判处死刑，缓期二年执行的有二十五名；判处无期徒刑的有二十五名；判处有期徒刑的有一百二十八名；判处释放的有三名。其中判处死刑立即执行的反革命罪犯，已于昨日下午执行枪决。
    北京市人民政府最近继续清理了四百一十八件反革命案件。这些案件，经北京市人民政府公安局和北京市人民检察署反复缜密地调查、审讯后，曾将其中为本市群众所熟悉或与群众有关的案件，分别交给群众讨论，并征求他们的处理意见。上述各机关又根据群众的意见，将这些案件再加以校正审理，拟具初步处理意见，送交北京市人民政府委员会和北京市各界人民代表会议协商委员会联席会议分组逐件审查后，由公安局提请北京市军事管制委员会军法处审判。军法处根据惩治反革命条例，对这四百一十八名反革命罪犯，依其犯罪事实对国家利益危害的严重程度，以及民愤的大小，分别判刑或释放。
    在这次判处死刑立即执行的二百三十七名反革命罪犯中，有特务一百二十五名，汉奸九名，恶霸二十八名，惯匪九名，反动会道门首恶分子二十七名，反动还乡队十六名，蒋匪伪军、警二十三名。其中绝大部分都是有血债的坚决反革命分子，被这些反革命罪犯亲手杀死或主谋、指挥杀害的共产党员、民主人士、进步群众，已被查出的就有一千三百九十二人。中统特务孙天章，在山东直接间接杀害的革命干部和群众达四十余人。军统特务江田，在一九四八年逮捕长辛店铁委会我地下革命人员十九人，杀害革命干部十余人。伪东北保安司令长官部集中营副主任杨碧尘，用残酷的冻饿手段，虐待被俘战士，死者八百多人。伪军排长康俊才，杀人之后还挖出人心来炒着吃。
    其中的另一类是长期以反革命为职业的特务分子。他们有五年、十年甚至二十年的反革命历史，受过三、四次专门的特务训练。其中一部分虽然没有直接杀过人，但在他们主谋、领导或组织下惨杀的革命干部及爱国人士是难以计算的。他们窃取我军政情报，替蒋匪训练特务，破坏学生运动和工人运动。他们对人民革命事业的危害是很严重的。如中统特务朱焕斗，有二十年反革命历史，替蒋匪训练特务五百余人，封闭重庆新华日报，制造了重庆沧白堂与较场口惨案。军统特务汪凌云，派遣特务潜入鞍山市，刺探我军事情报，匪军即乘隙进犯，使我鞍山驻军及人民群众遭受严重损失。军统特务丁义质曾任中美合作所渣滓洞及伪北平炮局看守所长，一九四八年在北京参与“八一九”大逮捕，亲手签发传票，拘捕各校进步学生。军统特务靳纪宣是十五年前镇压“一二九”学生运动的凶手，在冀县曾活埋爱国学生及革命干部六名。
    第三类是解放后仍怙恶不悛，继续进行反革命活动的特务分子。他们密设电台，给蒋匪送情报，打入我内部刺探国家机密，组织武装暴乱，企图颠覆人民政权。如军统特务陈浩，于解放后潜入我部队，煽动战士逃跑，并主谋杀害干部。军统特务陆捷音，在北京被围时，领到电台、经费、密码，企图潜伏，阴谋窃取我军政情报。军统特务陈亚平，于解放后发展反动地主、散兵游泳，组织所谓“联合国陆军总司令部情报处中国情报指挥所平津指挥室”和“冀东别动队”等反动组织，妄想配合美蒋“反攻大陆”，实行暴乱。军统特务温天和，解放后组织“滇、越、缅、泰边区反共军”，企图骚扰我国边防。
    第四类是反动会道门的首恶分子。他们在解放前罪大恶极，解放后继续进行反革命活动，与人民政府对抗。如一贯道外东组负责人赵四章，是北京一贯道头子张五福的亲信联络员，解放后匿藏并掩护张五福逃跑。九宫道大头子李才，解放前曾发展道徒六十余万人，解放后继续诈骗道徒并阴谋组织暴乱。
    第五类是恶霸。他们依靠反动势力，独霸一方，凌辱群众，残害人民，血债很多，民愤很大。如二十八个恶霸就曾逼死、打死群众四十八人。恶霸地主赵福臣、赵振东父子，独霸黄寺大楼一带三十余年，先后逼死、害死群众十三人。农民姜忠的家产及妇女六人为其霸占，姜忠父子被其逼死。
    第六类是勾结日本帝国主义，背叛祖国，出卖民族利益的大汉奸。如杜锡钧，历任伪治安总署督办，伪华北绥靖军上将总司令。曾参与袁世凯政府与日本帝国主义之间的二十一条卖国条约的签订，以后又提倡“大东亚共荣圈”卖国政策，并先后与我军作战一百二十余次。
    第七类是惯匪，他们解放后怙恶不悛，屡次行抢，严重地危害了人民生命财产的安全。如惯匪张文元，解放后在模式口一带，结伙行抢七次。
    最后一类是还乡队，他们都是坚决的反革命分子，解放前连续骚扰解放区，进行“反清算斗争”，破坏土地改革，惨杀农民，掠夺农民的胜利果实。如门头沟“刘家五虎”的刘文元，参加白箍还乡团为分队长，参加倒算，曾夺取农民的土地二十五亩、煤窑三座、牛马六头、粮食二十余石。又如刘第元，曾打死农民孙国。
    此外，另一些反革命罪犯，根据惩治反革命条例，也是罪该处死的，但因为他们没有血债，或民愤不大，或对国家利益的损害没有达到最严重程度，所以根据毛主席指示的原则，判处死刑，缓期二年执行，强迫劳动，以观后效。
    判处无期或有期徒刑的反革命罪犯，都是根据其犯罪事实的轻重确定刑期长短。在执行期间，强迫劳动，改造教育。
    最后，判处释放的反革命罪犯，都是罪行较小，或有立功表现者，或解放后有悔过自新的具体表现者，军法处已令其取保释放。
