Correct the Deviation of Neglecting the Construction of Democratic Power!
    Huailai County, Chahar Province, has a biased leading ideology, and the People's Representative Conference is deteriorating.
    Huailai County, Chahar Province, has convened six sessions of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles from October 1949 to the present, and has been exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress since the third session. The previous sessions have achieved certain results in promoting democracy, raising mass awareness, implementing policies, promoting work, and rectifying the style of cadres. In particular, the third meeting, which exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elected the county head, deputy county head, and members of the People's Government, made a deep impression on the people and had a relatively large impact.
    However, due to the county's leadership's rather strong closed-doorism in ideology, the county's People's Representative Conference, after exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress, not only failed to improve on its original basis, but instead deteriorated. This is reflected in:
    1. The number of attending representatives is decreasing. The total number of representatives in the county should be 208. The actual number of attendees at the third session was 181, the fourth session was 167, and the fifth session was 154. Although a great deal of administrative mobilization was carried out for the sixth session, only 170 people attended, and 30 of them were entrusted to others to attend on their behalf. Many representatives wanted to "change shifts."
    2. The leading cadres of the county do not believe that the People's Representative Conference and the people's representatives can solve any problems. They always feel that the representative conference is "not very meaningful," "very uncomfortable," and even "a burden." They are accustomed to using simple methods and administrative power to promote work, and are not good at using the power of the People's Representative Conference to give play to its role, in order to better complete tasks. They made an incorrect comparison between the People's Representative Conference and the cadre meeting, believing that the cadre meeting was more convenient to complete tasks. The People's Representative Conference will not be held unless the higher authorities urge it, and it will only be held once when forced. Cadres and representatives alike reflect: "There are many deployments, few discussions, and few problem-solving at each meeting." At each meeting, in addition to the responsible comrades of the county making reports on the situation, tasks, policies, and plans, the heads of various sections and bureaus also have to take the stage to issue orders and deploy the work of their departments. The tasks are complicated and the explanations are unclear. A peasant representative said: "I am not tired from working all day, but I am extremely tired from attending meetings all day." Representatives also cannot discuss matters in group meetings. The meeting notice is sent late, and the content is not detailed enough. Representatives do not know what problems will be solved at the meeting, so they cannot bring any opinions.
    3. Failure to respect the status of representatives and arbitrary removal of representatives. For example, Zhao Heng, a representative from the fifth district, only said some superstitious auspicious words at the first meeting, and some people were dissatisfied. The county leadership dismissed him without consideration, making many representatives feel that their status was not guaranteed. Because the county leadership did not pay attention to how to respect the powers of the representatives, many representatives held the idea of being a guest. At the same time, the county leadership believes that "the more cadres who serve as representatives, the better, as this is more convenient for deploying tasks and promoting work." This shows that the county's understanding of representatives is incomplete, and it has not paid attention to establishing the representatives' sense of ownership. For example, Wang Xingquan, a representative from Dongbalicun, believed that the responsibility of a representative was only to: "Receive tasks from the county and return to convey resolutions."
    4. Failure to seriously and responsibly handle proposals, causing representatives to feel disappointed. For example, the people of Dongbalicun have repeatedly requested a reasonable solution to the village's water use problem, but it has been delayed until now without being resolved, and the reasons for the failure to resolve it have not been explained in a timely manner, causing strong dissatisfaction among the masses. As a result, the number of proposals decreased from more than 380 at the third session to five or six at the sixth session.
    5. The meeting system and working system of the Standing Committee and the Government Committee are extremely unsound. The Standing Committee does not have resident members (it was reported once, but the special commissioner's office did not approve it). Ordinary representatives have a very vague impression of the Standing Committee, and even do not know that there is such an organization at all, confusing the Standing Committee with the Presidium of the People's Representative Conference or the Government Committee. All members of the Standing Committee, except for one person, are members of the Government Committee. The Government Committee has a total of fifteen members, and has only held two meetings since taking office, and there has been no contact at other times; some important measures have not been discussed by the Government Committee, and some members do not even know about the relocation of the county government from Huailai to Shacheng.

    Insufficient Understanding of the People's Representative Conference by Cadres in Jiaohe County, Hebei Province
    The People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Jiaohe County, Hebei Province, has been held six times so far, and has achieved many results; such as discussing the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, raising the people's political awareness, and stimulating production enthusiasm; discussing the summer grain requisition work, not only over fulfilling the task, but also making the determination of output quotas in some villages more realistic. At the most recent meeting, the county discussed combining production with carrying out a donation campaign, and the people's patriotic enthusiasm was high, donating more than 1.8 billion yuan. However, according to the self-criticism of the county's leading organs: Cadres lack sufficient understanding of the People's Representative Conference in their thinking; and the masses' sense of ownership as representatives has not been raised to the level it should be. The county leadership, except for providing specific guidance on the election of representatives at the first People's Representative Conference of All Circles, has not seriously mobilized the masses in subsequent sessions; nor has it conducted education on how representatives should collect proposals, contact the masses, and convey resolutions. Therefore, the people's representatives' understanding of their powers is still very vague. Some believe that the powers of representatives are higher than those of cadres; some believe that they are the same as cadres; and others believe that they are only assistants to cadres in conveying resolutions.
    Secondly, the allocation of representative quotas is not reasonable or broad enough. For example, among the 277 representatives at the fifth meeting held in February 1951, 70 were representatives of county and district organs; although there are many cast iron workers in the county, there were only two worker representatives.

    Confusion Among Cadres and Masses in Qing County, Hebei Province Regarding the People's Representative Conference and Cadre Meetings
    The People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Qing County, Hebei Province, has been held five times from 1949 to the present. Except for the first session, which was held relatively well, cadres have felt since the second session that "it is nothing more than that," and have shown laxity.
    Cadres and the masses lack a correct understanding of the People's Representative Conference: Generally, cadres are not clear about the nature of the representative conference and the cadre meeting, thinking that there is "no significant difference" between the two. At the same time, because too many cadres attend as non-voting delegates (for example, at the third session of the first People's Representative Conference of the county, the actual number of representatives was 201, and the number of village cadres attending as non-voting delegates was 706; at the second session of the second People's Representative Conference, the actual number of representatives was 216, and the number of village cadres attending as non-voting delegates was 814, with representatives and village cadres being grouped together), the People's Representative Conference actually becomes a joint meeting of representatives and cadres. Cadres believe that representatives are only bridges to help convey opinions, calling them "opinion leaders" (meaning they can only convey opinions and cannot make decisions); the representatives themselves also feel that they "do not have much influence." At the same time, when passing resolutions, cadres also participate in the vote. They do not understand that although cadres also serve the people by representing the interests of the people, the powers of the cadres attending as non-voting delegates and the formal representatives are obviously different at the People's Representative Conference.
    Cadres monopolize elections: In the indirect elections in 1949, the district convened a meeting of voter representatives to produce representatives to the county People's Representative Conference. For example, in the first district, 32 village voter representatives and more than 140 village cadres jointly elected the county representatives. When electing representatives in the spring of 1950, except for large villages where voters directly elected them, small villages still elected representatives according to the above method. When re-electing representatives this year, the district proposed a list of representatives who should be re-elected, and the village re-elected them after approval by the county Standing Committee. If the district believes that they should not be re-elected, they will not be re-elected. These elections fully demonstrate the leadership's monopolization and substitution, and the style is undemocratic. As a result of these elections, the phenomenon of impure composition among the representatives still exists seriously: For example, representative Wang Yushan once served as a Japanese imperialist agent and colluded with Japanese bandits to kill more than a dozen of our militiamen. He was arrested and executed in April after being reported by the people; Zhang Shusen, a representative from Wu Wangzhuang, once held a puppet position, and was dismissed by the district, but no re-election was held and he was not notified. In addition, Wang Shuzi, a representative from Tangyao Village, is recuperating in Beijing, and his accountant was sent to attend the meeting on his behalf without a by-election. According to Yang Guandian, the village chief, in some places, village cadres replaced representatives who did not attend the meeting. Teachers Jiao Dianxiu, Liu Jingkui, Huang Zimian, and Dai Shunong reflected that they had never elected representatives, nor had they seen representatives collect opinions or convey resolutions.
    In short, there are many shortcomings in the Qing County Representative Conference, and cadres' understanding of the Representative Conference is still quite vague; the influence of the Representative Conference among the masses is not yet profound, and it urgently needs to be rectified and improved.

### 纠正忽视民主政权建设工作的偏向！

　　纠正忽视民主政权建设工作的偏向！
    察哈尔省怀来县领导思想有偏向人民代表会议每况愈下
    察哈尔省怀来县自一九四九年十月到现在共召开过六次各界人民代表会议，于第三次开始代行人民代表大会的职权。历次会议，在发扬民主，提高群众觉悟，贯彻政策、推动工作及整顿干部作风方面，都收到一定的效果。特别是第三次会议，代行了人民代表大会的职权，选举了县长、副县长和人民政府委员，给予人民的印象很深，影响也比较大。
    但由于该县领导思想上存在着相当浓厚的关门主义，致使代行人民代表大会职权后的该县人民代表会议，不仅未能在原有基础上提高一步，反而每况愈下。这表现在：
    一、出席代表人数愈来愈少。全县应到代表人数为二○八人，第三次实到一八一人，第四次实到一六七人，第五次实到一五四人；第六次虽经行政上大力动员，亦只到一七○人，而其中有三○人是委托别人代替出席的。很多代表想“换班”。
    二、该县领导干部不相信人民代表会议和人民代表们能够解决什么问题，总觉得代表会议“意思不大”，“很不舒服”，甚至“是个负担”。他们习惯于用简单方式、行政力量去推动工作，而不善于运用人民代表会议的力量，发挥它的作用，来更好地完成任务。他们把人民代表会议和干部会做了不正确的比较，认为干部会更便于完成任务。上边不督促就不开人民代表会议，逼紧了才开一次。干部和代表都反映：“每次开会布置多，讨论少，解决问题少。”每次会上除由县的负责同志作有关形势、任务、方针、计划等报告外，各科、局长还要登台发号施令，布置本部门的工作，任务繁杂，交代不清。一位农民代表说：“叫我干一天活不累，叫我开一天会就累极了。”代表在小组会上也讨论不起来。会前通知发的迟，内容又不详细，代表不知道会上要解决什么问题，也就谈不上带什么意见来。
    三、不尊重代表的地位，随便撤换代表。如五区代表赵恒在第一次会上仅仅说了些迷信的吉利话，有些人因而不满，县领导上未加考虑即予撤职，使得很多代表觉得自己的地位没有保障。由于县领导上没有注意如何尊重代表的职权，使很多代表抱作客思想。同时，该县领导上认为“干部兼任代表者愈多愈好，这样对于布置任务，推动工作，比较方便。”这说明该县对代表的认识不完全，没有注意树立代表的主人翁思想。如东八里村代表王兴全以为代表的责任只是：“到县里领受任务，回来传达决议”。
    四、不能认真负责处理提案，因而代表们感到失望。如东八里村人民几次要求合理解决该村用水问题，延搁至今未予解决，又不及时解释未能解决的原因，群众深感不满。以致提案由第三次三百八十余件，至第六次减少到五、六件。
    五、常务委员会与政府委员会的会议制度和工作制度极不健全。常委会没有驻会委员（曾报过一次，专署没批准）。一般代表对常委会印象极模糊，甚至根本不知道有这么一个组织，把常委会和人民代表会议主席团或政府委员会相混淆。常务委员除一人外，全是政府委员。政府委员共十五人，自就职以来，只开过两次会，平时也没有联系；对一些重要措施也不通过政府委员会讨论，甚至对于县政府由怀来迁沙城的事情有的委员还不知道。
    河北省交河县干部对人民代表会议认识不足
    河北省交河县各界人民代表会议，迄今已开过六次，获得不少成绩；如讨论了镇压反革命，提高了人民政治觉悟，激发了生产情绪；讨论了夏征工作，不只超额完成任务，而且部分村庄定产量更真实了。最近一次会上商讨结合生产开展捐献运动，全县人民爱国主义的热情高涨，捐献了十八亿元之多。但据该县领导机关检讨：在干部思想上，对人民代表会议认识不足；群众代表的主人翁自觉程度尚未提到应有的高度。县的领导上，除在第一次各界人民代表会议时，对代表的选举曾作过具体的指导外，以后几次就没有认真地发动群众；对代表如何搜集提案、联系群众及传达决议，都没有进行教育。因此，人民代表对自己职权的认识还很模糊，有的认为代表比干部职权要高些；有的认为与干部一样；也有的认为他们仅是干部传达决议的助手。
    其次，代表名额的分配不够合理，不够广泛。如一九五一年二月间所召开的第五次会议二七七个代表中，县区机关代表即达七○人；该县铸铧工人很多，而工人代表仅有二名。
    河北省青县干部和群众对于人民代表会和干部会认识混淆
    河北省青县各界人民代表会议从一九四九年到现在已召开过五次，除第一次开的较好外，自第二次会议起干部即认为“不过如此”，表现松懈。
    干部与群众对人民代表会议缺乏正确认识：一般干部对代表会和干部会的性质认识不清，以为二者“并无显著差别”。同时，因干部列席太多（如该县一届三次人民代表会议实到代表二○一人，列席村干部七○六人，二届二次人民代表会议实到代表二一六人，列席村干部八一四人，代表与村干部一块编小组），人民代表会议，实际上变成代表与干部联席会。干部认为代表只是帮助传达意见的桥梁，称之为“意见长”（意即只能传达意见，不能决定问题）；代表本身也觉得自己“意思不大”。同时在通过决议时，干部亦参加表决，他们不懂得干部虽然也都是代表人民利益为人民服务的；但是在人民代表会议上，列席的干部和正式代表的权力显然是有不同的。
    干部包办选举：在一九四九年间接选举时，由区里召开选民代表会议产生县人民代表会议的代表，如一区三十二村选民代表三十二人，村干部一四○余人，共同选举县代表。一九五○年春选举代表时，除大村由选民直接选出外，小村仍按上述办法选举。今年改选代表时，由区提出应该改选的代表名单，经县常委会批准后，始由村改选，如区认为不应改选者即不改选。这些选举都充分表现了领导上包办代替，作风不民主。这样选举的结果，代表中成份不纯的现象，仍然严重存在：如代表王玉山曾充当过日本帝国主义的特务，勾结日寇杀害我民兵十余人，在四月间经人民检举后枪毙；武王庄代表张树森曾任过伪职，经区免职后并未另选亦未通知本人。此外，唐尧村代表王树滋在北京养病，也未补选即以其管账的先生代为出席。据杨官淀村长谈，有些地方代表不出席会议而以村干部代替。教员缴殿秀、刘景奎、黄自勉、戴树农等四人反映，他们并未选过代表也未见代表搜集过意见，和传达过决议。
    总之，青县代表会的缺点很多，干部对代表会的认识还相当模糊；代表会在群众中的影响还不深刻，亟须加以整顿和提高。
