Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: Sixteen members of the staff of our People's Republic of China's embassy and consulates in Indonesia, holding official passports, departed from Beijing for Indonesia after obtaining entry visas issued by the Indonesian Embassy in China on June 19th. Unexpectedly, upon arriving in Jakarta by ship on July 22nd, they were refused entry by the Indonesian government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government considers this an unprecedented act violating international norms and a serious unfriendly gesture, and lodged a protest with the Indonesian Embassy in China on July 26th. On July 31st, our Ambassador to Indonesia, Wang Renshu, also lodged a protest with the Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the protest, our government pointed out that since the sixteen members of our embassy and consulates had obtained entry visas from the Indonesian Embassy in China, according to international practice, it was equivalent to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs having already notified the Indonesian government of the list of these personnel through the Indonesian Embassy in China and obtained their consent to enter the country. The Indonesian government's excuse that our embassy had not previously notified them of the list of sixteen people, and therefore refused them landing, is completely unfounded. However, the Indonesian government disregarded our government's protest and the request our government made to the Indonesian government to reconsider the refusal of landing, and continued to adopt unreasonable and unfriendly attitudes, with the result that the sixteen members of our embassy and consulates were forced to return home on the original ship on August 8th. Our government and people express great regret over this matter.

　　印尼政府违反国际惯例  我赴使馆人员被迫返国
    我政府和人民对此极表示遗憾
    【新华社十一日讯】我中华人民共和国持有官员护照之驻印尼使领馆十六位人员，前于六月十九日获得印尼驻华大使馆签发之入境签证后，即由北京启程前赴印尼。不料于七月二十二日乘船抵雅加达时，竟被印尼政府拒绝登陆入境。我中央人民政府外交部认为这是违反国际惯例的空前举动，且是一种严重的不友好的表示，并于七月二十六日向印尼驻华大使馆提出抗议。七月三十一日我驻印尼大使王任叔复向印尼外交部长提出抗议。在抗议中，我国政府曾指出我使领馆十六位人员既已取得印尼驻华大使馆入境签证，按照国际惯例，就等于我国外交部业已将这批人员的名单经过印尼驻华大使馆通知了印尼政府，并获得同意入境。印尼政府借口我大使馆事先未曾通知十六人名单，因而拒绝他们登陆，是完全没有理由的。但印尼政府不顾我政府抗议，以及我政府向印尼政府提出的关于重新考虑拒绝登陆一事的要求，竟继续采取不合理的和不友好的态度，以致我使领馆十六人员被迫于八月八日乘原船回国。我政府和人民对此事表示极大遗憾。
