On July 12, 1951, the governments of the United States of America and the United Kingdom simultaneously announced in Washington and London a draft peace treaty with Japan. Subsequently, on July 20 of the same year, the government of the United States of America issued a notice convening the San Francisco Conference, preparing to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan. Regarding this matter, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China deems it necessary to authorize myself to issue the following statement:

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the draft peace treaty with Japan proposed by the US and UK governments is a draft that violates international agreements and is fundamentally unacceptable, and that the San Francisco Conference, which will be forcibly convened by the US government on September 4 and which openly excludes the People's Republic of China, is a conference that abandons international obligations and is fundamentally unacknowledged.

The US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan, both in terms of its preparation procedure and its content, conspicuously violates important international agreements such as the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942, the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation and Agreement, and the Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan passed by the Far Eastern Commission on June 19, 1947, all of which the US and UK governments participated in and signed. The United Nations Declaration stipulates that there should be no separate peace, and the Potsdam Agreement stipulates that "the preparation of the peace treaty" should be carried out by member states that signed the surrender terms of the enemy country. At the same time, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China fully agreed with the Soviet government's proposal that all countries that had participated in the war against Japan with force should participate in the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan. However, after the US government had long refused to implement the principles of the Potsdam Agreement in order to delay the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan, the preparation of the current draft peace treaty with Japan was handled solely by the United States, excluding most countries that fought against Japan, especially the major countries that fought against Japan, China and the Soviet Union, from the preparation of the peace treaty. The United States forcibly convened a conference excluding the People's Republic of China, attempting to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan. This action of the US government, with the support of the British government, is clearly undermining the conclusion of a comprehensive and genuine peace treaty between Japan and all countries at war with it, and is forcing Japan and some countries at war with Japan to accept a separate peace treaty that only benefits the US government itself and is detrimental to the people of all countries, including the US and Japan. In reality, this is a treaty preparing for a new war, not a genuine peace treaty.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China's conclusion is based on irrefutable evidence from the basic content of the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan.

First of all, because the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan is a product of the US government's separate peace with Japan and its vassal states, this draft treaty not only disregards the opinions of the Chinese and Soviet governments in their repeated statements regarding the main goals of the peace treaty with Japan, but also most absurdly and openly excludes the People's Republic of China from the ranks of the Allied nations that fought against Japan. After World War I, Japanese imperialism's armed aggression against China began in 1931, and in 1937, it launched a war of aggression against the whole of China, and only in 1941 did it launch the Pacific War. The Chinese people, in their war to resist and defeat Japanese imperialism, went through the longest period of arduous struggle, made the greatest sacrifices, and contributed the most. Therefore, the Chinese people and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China that they established have the most legitimate right to speak and participate in the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. However, the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan, in its provisions regarding the handling of the property and rights of Allied nations and their nationals in Japan during the war, stipulates the starting and ending dates as from December 7, 1941, to September 2, 1945, completely obliterating the period before December 7, 1941, when the Chinese people independently carried out the war of resistance against Japan. Such illegal and barbaric behavior by the US and UK governments in excluding the People's Republic of China and antagonizing the Chinese people is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people and will be resolutely opposed to the end.

Second, the territorial provisions of the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan are entirely in line with the US government's demands for expansion, occupation, and aggression. On the one hand, the draft ensures that the US government, in addition to retaining the trusteeship power over the Pacific islands formerly mandated to Japan by the League of Nations, also obtains the trusteeship power over the Ryukyu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, the Iwo Jima Islands, Nishinoshima, Okinotori Island, and Minami-Tori-shima, which in reality means maintaining the power to continue occupying these islands, which have never been stipulated in any past international agreements as being separated from Japan. On the other hand, the draft violates the agreements in the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Proclamation, only stipulating that Japan renounce all rights to Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and to the Kuril Islands and the southern part of Sakhalin Island and all islands adjacent to them, while not mentioning a word about the agreement to return Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to the People's Republic of China and to hand over and return the Kuril Islands and the southern part of Sakhalin Island and all islands adjacent to them to the Soviet Union. The latter's purpose is to attempt to create tense relations with the Soviet Union in order to cover up the US's expansionist occupation. The former's purpose is to prolong the US government's occupation of China's territory, Taiwan, but the Chinese people will absolutely not allow this occupation and will not at any time abandon the sacred responsibility of liberating Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. At the same time, the draft deliberately stipulates that Japan renounce all rights to the Nansha Islands and the Xisha Islands without mentioning the issue of returning sovereignty. In reality, the Xisha Islands and the Nansha Islands, like the entire Nansha Islands, Zhongsha Islands, and Dongsha Islands, have always been Chinese territory. Although they were once occupied when Japanese imperialism launched its war of aggression, they were all taken over by the then Chinese government after Japan surrendered. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China hereby declares that the inviolable sovereignty of the People's Republic of China over the Nansha Islands and the Xisha Islands will not be affected in any way, regardless of whether or how the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan stipulates it.

Third, the most important goal of the peace treaty with Japan, as everyone knows, should be to make Japan a peace-loving, democratic, and independent country, and to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, so as to ensure that Japan does not become an aggressive country threatening peace and security in Asia and the world again. However, the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan not only provides no guarantee for this, but on the contrary, it violates the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation and the Far Eastern Commission's Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan regarding such issues. In terms of security and political provisions, the draft does not place any restrictions on the Japanese army, does not stipulate the banning of surviving and revived militarist groups, and does not provide any guarantee for the people's democratic rights. In reality, all the measures taken by the US occupation authorities in Japan in recent years have been doing their utmost to prevent the democratization of Japan and to restore Japanese militarism. Instead of destroying Japan's war-making power, the US occupation authorities are expanding Japan's military bases, training Japan's secret armed forces, reviving Japanese militarist groups, releasing Japanese war criminals, and exonerating a large number of purged elements, in violation of the Far Eastern Commission's policy. Especially in the war of intervention in Korea, they have already begun to utilize Japanese manpower, restore and develop Japan's military industry, to support its military aggression. In order to facilitate the long-term US occupation of Japan, not withdrawing its troops, and controlling Japan to make it the US's forward base for aggression in the East, the draft further stipulates that the Allied occupation forces can remain in Japan for a long time through agreements with Japan. This plan of the US government, which clearly violates international treaty obligations, is supported by the Yoshida government, which has become the political pillar of the US occupation of Japan. The US government and the Japanese Yoshida government are colluding with each other, plotting to rearm Japan, enslave the Japanese people, and push Japan onto the path of aggression that once brought Japan to the brink of destruction, and onto the path of becoming a dependent and colonialized country subservient to the US aggression plan and pulling chestnuts out of the fire for the US government. This is a conspiracy to prevent the Japanese people from taking another path of peace, democracy, independence, and happiness. According to the provisions of the aforementioned draft, a US-Japan military agreement is being secretly planned. This planned military agreement, like the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan, is hostile to China and the Soviet Union and threatens the security of Asian countries and peoples who have suffered from Japanese aggression in the past. From this, it can be seen that the reason why the US and UK governments are eager to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan is by no means to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, promote Japanese democracy, and safeguard peace and security in Asia and the world, but to rearm Japan and prepare for a new world war of aggression by the US government and its vassal states. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China cannot but express its firm opposition to this.

Fourth, in order to step up preparations for a new world war of aggression, the US government will inevitably further tighten its control over the Japanese economy. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly stated that the development of Japan's peaceful economy and the normal trade relations between Japan and other countries should not be restricted or monopolized. However, because the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan is a separate peace treaty with Japan that is hostile to China and the Soviet Union and threatens Asian countries, its economic provisions also exclude China and the Soviet Union, and exclude many countries that cannot accept this draft treaty. At the same time, the US government can further utilize the privileges it has already obtained through US companies in the Japanese economy and the various restrictions it places on the Japanese peaceful economy to make these economic provisions more suitable for its monopoly demands. Therefore, if this separate peace treaty with Japan is signed, Japan's colonialized dependence on the US economy will be further deepened, not only will the military industry produce in accordance with the US's world war plan, but even general industries will serve the US's economic aggression in Asia, and the normal trade relations between Japan and China and other neighboring countries for the sake of developing a peaceful economy and improving the people's livelihood will be subjected to more barbarous and unreasonable restrictions. This will be a disaster for the Japanese people and the Asian people, and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that it should be resolutely opposed.

Fifth, regarding the issue of reparations, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that it is necessary to clarify the confusion deliberately created by the US government in the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan. The draft recognizes in principle that Japan should provide reparations for the damage and suffering it caused in the war, but at the same time it says that Japan lacks the ability to pay reparations and fulfill other obligations if it wants to maintain a sound economy. On the surface, it seems that the US government is most concerned about the soundness of the Japanese economy, but in reality, the US government has been seizing and is still seizing Japan's reparations and damaging and is still damaging Japan's economy by utilizing various privileges and restrictions during the six years of occupying and controlling Japan. The US government does not allow other countries that have suffered damage from Japanese aggression to demand reparations from Japan, and its unspeakable hidden agenda is to preserve Japan's ability to pay reparations and fulfill other obligations in order to continue to supply the exploitation of US monopoly capital. If Japan's ability to pay reparations and fulfill other obligations is already felt to be lacking, it is the result of the US occupation authorities' excessive seizure and damage to them. As long as the US government abides by international treaty obligations, withdraws its occupation forces as soon as possible after the signing of the peace treaty, immediately stops building military bases, abandons its plan to rearm Japan and restore Japan's military industry, cancels the privileges of US companies in the Japanese economy, and cancels restrictions on Japan's peaceful economy and Japan's normal foreign trade, the Japanese economy will truly become sound. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is willing to see Japan able to develop a peaceful economy in a sound manner and restore and develop normal trade relations between China and Japan, so that the lives of the Japanese people will no longer be threatened and damaged by war and will have the possibility of genuine improvement. At the same time, those countries that were occupied by Japan, suffered great damage, and have difficulty recovering on their own should retain the right to demand reparations.

Based on the above, it is sufficient to prove that the US-UK draft peace treaty with Japan is a complete violation of international agreements, damages the interests of the Allied nations against Japan, is hostile to China and the Soviet Union, threatens the Asian people, undermines peace and security in the world, and is not in the interest of the Japanese people. The US government and its vassal states are pursuing only one central goal in this draft treaty, which is to rearm Japan in order to continue and expand the war of aggression in Asia and to step up preparations for a new world war, so this draft treaty is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people and the Asian people who have suffered from Japanese aggression.

In order to facilitate the rapid signing of this separate peace treaty with Japan, the US government also openly excluded the People's Republic of China, the main country that fought against Japan, in the notice convening the San Francisco Conference, thus thoroughly violating the provision of the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942, regarding no separate peace. It is very clear that the US government's forced convening of the San Francisco Conference, excluding the People's Republic of China, is for the purpose of splitting the Allied nations against Japan and organizing a new Far Eastern aggressive bloc. The so-called "trilateral security treaty" between the US, Australia, and New Zealand and the secretly negotiated US-Japan military agreement will be established in or after this conference, and they will threaten the peace and security of the entire Pacific and Asian peoples. Therefore, this San Francisco Conference cannot sign a joint peace treaty with Japan in the absence of the People's Republic of China, and even if the United States and its vassal states directly sign a separate peace treaty with Japan, it will be absolutely unrecognized by the Chinese people.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has always maintained that a common, not separate, fair and reasonable, not forcibly monopolistic, and truly peaceful, not war-preparing, peace treaty with Japan should be concluded in the shortest possible time on the basis of the United Nations Declaration, the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation and Agreement, and the main international documents such as the Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan passed by the Far Eastern Commission, through the preparation of the major countries that fought against Japan and the participation of all countries that fought against Japan. In order to promote the realization of this goal, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China authorized myself to issue a statement on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan on December 4, 1950, and on May 22, 1951, sent a note to Mr. Roshchin, the Soviet Ambassador to China, fully agreeing with the Soviet government's specific proposals for preparing the peace treaty with Japan. The Central People's Government believes that all the specific proposals regarding the peace treaty with Japan put forward in that statement and note remain valid.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China now declares once again that the preparation, drafting, and signing of the peace treaty with Japan, without the participation of the People's Republic of China, will be considered illegal by the Central People's Government, regardless of its content and outcome, and therefore also invalid.

In order to truly help restore peace in Asia and resolve the Far East issue, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China firmly maintains that a conference of representatives of all countries that participated in the war against Japan with troops should be convened according to the Soviet government's proposal to discuss the issue of a common peace treaty with Japan. At the same time, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is prepared to exchange views on the issue of a common peace treaty with Japan with all countries that participated in the war against Japan, on the basis of the United Nations Declaration, the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation and Agreement, and the Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan passed by the Far Eastern Commission.

### 中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来  关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的声明

　　中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来
    关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的声明
    一九五一年七月十二日，美利坚合众国政府和联合王国政府在华盛顿和伦敦同时公布对日本和平条约草案，美利坚合众国政府复于同年七月二十日发出召开旧金山会议的通知，准备签订对日单独和约。关于此事，中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为有必要授权本人发表下列声明：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为美英两国政府所提出的对日和约草案是一件破坏国际协定基本上不能被接受的草案，而将于九月四日由美国政府强制召开、公然将中华人民共和国排斥在外的旧金山会议也是一个背弃国际义务基本上不能被承认的会议。
    美英对日和约草案，不论从它的准备程序上或它的内容上讲，都是彰明较著地破坏了一九四二年一月一日的联合国宣言、开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告和协定及一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会所通过的对投降后日本之基本政策等重要国际协定，而这些协定都是美英两国政府参加签字了的。联合国宣言规定不得单独媾和，波茨坦协定规定“和约的准备工作”应由在敌国投降条款上签字之会员国进行，同时，中华人民共和国中央人民政府曾完全同意苏联政府的建议，主张所有曾以武力参加对日作战的国家都参与制定对日和约的准备工作，但是，美国政府在长期地拒绝实施波茨坦协定原则以拖延对日和约的准备工作之后，竟由美国一国包办了现在提出的这一对日和约草案的准备工作，而将大多数对日作战国家尤其是中苏主要对日作战国家，排斥于和约的准备工作之外。并由美国一国强制召开排斥中华人民共和国在外的和会，企图签订对日的单独和约。美国政府这一违背国际协定的行动，在英国政府支持之下，显然是在破坏日本与所有与它处于战争状态的国家缔结全面的真正的和约，并正在强制日本与某些对日作战国家接受只有利于美国政府自己而不利于包含美日两国在内的各国人民的单独和约，实际上这是一个准备新的战争的条约，并非真正的和平条约。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府这一论断，是从美英对日和约草案的基本内容上得到无可辩驳的根据的。
    首先，由于美英对日和约草案是美国政府与其附庸国家进行对日单独媾和的产品，所以这一和约草案不仅无视中苏两国政府历次声明中关于对日和约主要目标的意见，并且最荒谬地公然排除中华人民共和国于对日作战的盟国之列。第一次世界战争后，日本帝国主义武装侵略中国，是开始于一九三一年，至一九三七年，更发动了向全中国的侵略战争，至一九四一年，方发动太平洋战争。中国人民在抵抗和击败日本帝国主义的战争中，经过了最长期的艰苦奋斗，牺牲最大，贡献最多，因之，中国人民及其所建立的中华人民共和国中央人民政府在对日和约问题上是最有合法权利的发言者和参加者。可是，美英对日和约草案竟在它关于处理盟国及其国民于战争时期在日本的财产和权益的条文中，规定起讫日期，由一九四一年十二月七日起至一九四五年九月二日止，而将一九四一年十二月七日以前中国人民独力进行抗日战争那一时期完全抹煞。美英两国政府这种排斥中华人民共和国和敌视中国人民的非法蛮横行为，是中国人民绝对不能容忍并将坚决反对到底的。
    第二、美英对日和约草案在领土条款上是完全适合美国政府扩张占领和侵略的要求的。草案一方面保证美国政府除保有对于前由国际联盟委任日本统治的太平洋岛屿的托管权力外，并获得对于琉球群岛、小笠原群岛、琉璜列岛、西之岛、冲之鸟岛及南鸟岛等的托管权力，实际上就是保持继续占领这些岛屿的权力，而这些岛屿在过去任何国际协定中均未曾被规定脱离日本的。草案另一方面却破坏了开罗宣言、雅尔达协定和波茨坦公告中的协议，只规定日本放弃对于台湾和澎湖列岛及对于千岛群岛和库页岛南部及其附近一切岛屿的一切权利，而关于将台湾和澎湖列岛归还给中华人民共和国及将千岛群岛和库页岛南部及其附近一切岛屿交予和交还给苏联的协议却一字不提。后者的目的是企图造成对苏联的紧张关系以掩盖美国的扩张占领。前者的目的是为的使美国政府侵占中国的领土台湾得以长期化，但中国人民却绝对不能容许这种侵占，并在任何时候都不放弃解放台湾和澎湖列岛的神圣责任的。同时，草案又故意规定日本放弃对南威岛和西沙群岛的一切权利而亦不提归还主权问题。实际上，西沙群岛和南威岛正如整个南沙群岛及中沙群岛、东沙群岛一样，向为中国领土，在日本帝国主义发动侵略战争时虽曾一度沦陷，但日本投降后已为当时中国政府全部接收。中华人民共和国中央人民政府于此声明：中华人民共和国在南威岛和西沙群岛之不可侵犯的主权，不论美英对日和约草案有无规定及如何规定，均不受任何影响。
    第三、对日和约的最主要目标，如众所知，应该是使日本成为爱好和平的、民主的、独立的国家，并防止日本军国主义复活，以保证日本不再度成为威胁亚洲与世界和平安全的侵略国家。但是，美英对日和约草案不仅对此毫无保证，相反的，它还破坏了波茨坦公告及远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策关于这类问题的规定。草案在安全和政治条款上，对于日本军队没有任何限制，对于残存的和复活的军国主义团体没有规定取缔，对于人民民主权利没有任何保障。实际上，美国占领当局在日本这几年的一切措施，已经竭力在阻止日本的民主化与恢复日本的军国主义。美国占领当局不是在毁灭日本的制造战争的力量，而是违反远东委员会的政策，扩大日本的军事基地，训练日本的秘密武装，复活日本的军国主义团体，释放日本的战犯，开脱大批被整肃的分子，尤其在干涉朝鲜的战争中已经开始利用日本的人力，恢复和发展日本的军事工业，来支援它的军事侵略。为了便利美国长期占领日本、不撤退它的驻军、并控制日本使之成为美国在东方的侵略前哨起见，草案更进一步地规定盟国占领军可以经过与日本的协定而在日本长期地留驻下去。美国政府这一显然违反国际协定义务的计划，是得到成为美国占领日本的政治支柱的吉田政府支持的。美国政府和日本吉田政府正在互相勾结，阴谋重新武装日本，奴役日本人民，将日本再度推上曾经使日本濒于毁灭边缘的侵略道路，并且是服从于美国侵略计划并为美国政府火中取栗的附属国和殖民地化的道路。这是阻碍日本人民走向另一条和平、民主、独立和幸福的道路的阴谋。根据上述草案的规定，美日军事协定正在秘密计议中。这一计议中的军事协定正像美英对日和约草案一样，它是敌视中苏两国，威胁着过去曾受日本侵略的亚洲国家和人民的安全的。由此可见，美英政府之所以急于签订对日单独和约，决不是为的防止日本军国主义复活，推进日本民主，保卫亚洲和世界的和平安全，而是为的重新武装日本，为美国政府及其附庸国家准备新的世界侵略战争。中华人民共和国中央人民政府对此不能不表示坚决反对。
    第四、美国政府为了加紧准备新的世界侵略战争，就必然会更加紧对于日本经济的控制。中华人民共和国中央人民政府曾一再声明，对于日本和平经济之发展及日本与其他国家的正常贸易关系，不应加以限制和垄断。然而，由于美英对日和约草案是敌视中苏和威胁亚洲国家的对日单独和约，所以它的经济条款也就是排除中苏的，并且是排除不能接受这一和约草案的许多国家的；同时，美国政府更可利用它经过美国公司在日本经济中已经取得的特权及它对于日本和平经济的各种限制，使这些经济条款更适应于它的垄断要求。因此，这一对日单独和约如被签订，日本经济依赖于美国的殖民地化的地位将更加深，不仅军事工业将依照美国的世界战争计划生产，就连一般工业也将为美国的亚洲经济侵略服务，而日本与中国及其他邻国为着发展和平经济、改善人民生活的正常贸易关系，将受到更横蛮无理的限制。这将是日本人民和亚洲人民的灾害，中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为应该予以坚决的反对。
    第五、关于赔偿问题，中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为必须澄清美国政府在美英对日和约草案上故意造成的混乱。草案承认在原则上日本应对其在战争中所引起之损害及痛苦给予赔偿，但同时又说如欲维持健全之经济，则日本缺乏赔偿能力和履行其他义务能力。从形式上看，好像美国政府最关心日本经济的健全似的，实际上，美国政府在占领和管制日本的六年当中，已经利用各种特权和限制，窃取了并仍在窃取着日本的赔偿，损害了并仍在损害着日本的经济。美国政府不让其他曾受日本侵略损害的国家向日本要求赔偿，其不可告人的隐衷，就是为保存日本的赔偿能力和履行其他义务能力，继续供给美国独占资本的榨取。如果说，日本的赔偿能力和履行其他义务的能力已经感到缺乏，那就是美国占领当局过份窃取和损害它们的结果。只要美国政府遵守国际协定的义务，在和约签订后早日撤退占领军，立即停止建筑军事基地，放弃重新武装日本和恢复日本军事工业的计划，取消美国公司在日本经济中的特权，取消对日本和平经济及日本对外正常贸易的限制，则日本经济就会真正健全起来。中华人民共和国中央人民政府愿意看到日本能够健全地发展和平经济，并恢复和发展中日两国间的正常贸易关系，使日本人民的生活不再受战争的威胁和损害而得到真正改善的可能。同时，那些曾被日本占领、遭受损害甚大而自己又很难恢复的国家应该保有要求赔偿的权利。
    根据上述各项，足以证明美英对日和约草案是完全破坏国际协定，损害对日盟国利益，敌视中苏两国，威胁亚洲人民，破坏世界和平安全，并不利于日本人民的。美国政府及其附庸国家在这个和约草案中，只追求一个中心目标，即是重新武装日本，以便继续和扩大在亚洲的侵略战争，并加紧准备新的世界战争，所以这个和约草案是中国人民及曾被日本侵略的亚洲人民所绝对不能接受的。
    美国政府为了便于迅速签订这一对日单独和约，于是在召开旧金山会议的通知中，也公开排斥主要对日作战国家的中华人民共和国，这样，它就彻头彻尾地破坏了一九四二年一月一日联合国宣言关于不得单独媾和的规定。很显然，美国政府强制召开旧金山会议，将中华人民共和国排斥在外，就是为了分裂对日盟国，组织新的远东侵略集团。美国、澳大利亚、新西兰的所谓“三边安全条约”及密议中的美日军事协定都将在这个会议中或会议后成立，它们将威胁着整个太平洋及亚洲人民的和平安全。因此，这个旧金山会议在排斥中华人民共和国参加的情况下是不可能签订对日共同和约的，即使美国及其附庸国家迳自签订了对日单独和约，也是中国人民所绝对不能承认的。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府历来主张，应在联合国宣言、开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告和协定及远东委员会所通过的对投降后日本之基本政策等主要国际文件的基础上，经过对日作战主要国家的准备和所有对日作战国家的参加，在尽可能的短期内，缔结共同的而不是单独的、公平合理的而不是强制独占的、真正和平的而不是准备战争的对日和平条约。为促进这一目的的实现，中华人民共和国中央人民政府曾授权本人于一九五零年十二月四日就对日和约问题发表声明，并于一九五一年五月二十二日照会苏联驻华大使罗申先生完全同意苏联政府关于准备对日和约的具体建议。凡在那个声明和照会中所提出的关于对日和约的具体主张，中央人民政府认为继续有效。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府现在再一次声明：对日和约的准备、拟制和签订，如果没有中华人民共和国的参加，无论其内容和结果如何，中央人民政府一概认为是非法的，因而也是无效的。
    为了真正有助于恢复亚洲和平及解决远东问题起见，中华人民共和国中央人民政府坚决主张，应该根据苏联政府的提议，召开曾以军队参加对日战争的一切国家的代表的和会，来商定共同对日和约问题。同时，中华人民共和国中央人民政府准备以联合国宣言、开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告和协定及远东委员会所通过的对投降后日本之基本政策为基础，与参加对日作战的一切国家，就共同对日和约问题交换意见。
                                         一九五一年八月十五日
