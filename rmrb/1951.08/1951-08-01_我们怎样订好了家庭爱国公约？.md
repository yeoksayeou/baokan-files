　　How We Established Our Family Patriotic Pact?
　　Related by Yang Borong, Compiled by Wu Yang

　　Editor's Note: Yang Borong, the village chief of Heping Village, Xindu District, Wuxi, Southern Jiangsu, first conducted patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea with his wife. After a family discussion, they established a family patriotic pact. When the pact was established, they also discussed ways to increase production and donate airplanes and cannons. Based on the current political tasks, combined with their own work, production, and study, they summarized concrete and concise articles and stipulated inspection methods. This approach can be learned by the masses in various regions, especially district and village cadres and activists. However, there is a shortcoming in Yang Borong's family's patriotic pact, which is that they did not include the specific production goals they had determined in the family meeting. The patriotic production increase movement is one of the most important tasks for rural cadres and the masses and should be included in the patriotic pact.

　　I am the village chief of Heping Village, Xindu District, Wuxi. On July 3rd, the district held a conference of township and village-level cadres to determine the elimination of "blank villages" and "blank people" in patriotic education for resisting America and aiding Korea, to mobilize the establishment or revision of patriotic pacts, to carry out the patriotic movement to increase production and donate airplanes and cannons, and to do a good job of substitute farming. Instructor Huan made a report at the meeting. He used examples to illustrate: today, some cadres' family members still do not understand resisting America and aiding Korea. I thought, yes, like me, as the village chief, my wife Zhang Er'e does not understand why we should resist America and aid Korea. When I come out to attend meetings, she often argues with me, blaming me for "eating my own rice and doing 'other people's' business." This sometimes affects my work. Therefore, I decided to first carry out propaganda and education on my wife.

　　After returning home, once, when I was working with her in the field, I started by talking about the current situation of exchanging wheat for rice. I said, "This year, the People's Government purchases wheat, and one bag of wheat can be exchanged for one dan of rice (when the reactionary government ruled, they lowered the price of wheat, and it took three dan of wheat to exchange for one shi of rice), and the farmers no longer eat thin porridge and wheat bran. There will be no famine in summer and autumn, and we can eat white rice. Without the Communist Party and the People's Government, where would we get this kind of life?" Then, I talked about how the American devils are invading Korea and arming Japan, wholeheartedly wanting to invade our China and not let us live a good life. They are "wearing the same pants" with Chiang Kai-shek, the landlord class, bandits, and secret agents. I asked her, "Do you want to suffer a second time?" She said, "Only dead people want to, no living person wants to suffer that kind of hardship again." So I said, "If you don't want to suffer, you must resist America and aid Korea. Only by resisting America and aiding Korea can we protect our country and defend our achievements, and have a good life forever." Later, I repeatedly talked about how to resist America and aid Korea, and also explained to her the significance of establishing a patriotic pact and increasing production to donate airplanes and cannons.

　　On July 8th, our family—me, Zhang Er'e, and son Wenjun (thirteen years old, in school)—decided to establish a family patriotic pact.

　　When discussing the establishment of the patriotic pact, I said to my wife, "I want to guarantee that I will do my work well; you guarantee not to hold me back, which is also for resisting America and aiding Korea." She said, "Okay, I will let you do your work, but the fields must not be left uncultivated. You must be responsible for doing a good job with the eight mu of paddy fields. If there is a meeting in the afternoon, don't go to the streets to wander around in the morning, get up early and go to the fields every day." My son Wenjun also raised some opinions to me. He said, "Don't be procrastinating in your work, come back earlier to manage production after the meeting is over." I accepted these opinions and included them in the patriotic pact. Zhang Er'e also talked about what she guaranteed to do. She said, "I must take good care of the fields and life, raise pigs well, raise sheep well, and cut two baskets of grass for the sheep every day; the two children, three and five years old, must also be taken care of well." Wenjun also said, "I must study hard, guarantee not to be absent from class or late. Get up early in the morning to pick up dog feces; after school in the evening, help my mother cut one more basket of grass to feed the sheep." All of these were included in the patriotic pact.

　　When discussing how to donate airplanes and cannons, Zhang Er'e first proposed: she would make a pair of shoes for me every month. In the past, she would ask a cobbler to put on the soles, but now she will do it herself, saving 1,000 yuan per month, which would be 6,000 yuan in half a year to donate. I said, "It's good to save like this, but we must also plan from increasing income." I proposed to plant rice early this year and weed the rice one more time. Last year, we hired two workers to plant and weed the rice. This year, we will get up early and work late by ourselves, and do it more carefully, without hiring workers. In this way, eight mu of paddy fields can increase production by ten jin of rice per mu (last year's yield was 550 jin of rice per mu, this year's plan is to increase production by 10% to harvest 605 jin, and now the plan is to harvest 615 jin). Everyone thought it was possible and decided to donate five jin per mu. In addition, everyone used their brains and decided to plant cabbage and pickled mustard tuber in one mu of peach field after harvesting the peaches (which was not planted last year), which can be sold for one dan of rice and donate two dou of rice. Plant cowpeas on the fence around the peach field (which was not planted last year), which can be sold for two dou of rice after they are ripe, and donate two sheng. This year, the peaches have already set, and the original plan was to produce 200 jin of peaches. Apply fertilizer quickly, and the peaches will grow bigger, and we can increase production by 20 jin, worth a total of 30,000 yuan. After deducting 20,000 yuan for buying fertilizer, the remaining 10,000 yuan will be donated. This year's autumn silkworms can produce 28 jin of cocoons; take good care of them and produce two more jin of cocoons, donating one jin. In addition, thinking that there are six chicks at home, two of which are roosters, originally planned to be slaughtered and eaten during the Chinese New Year this year, now save one to donate; at the same time, raise the chicks well, and in half a year, one will weigh four jin, worth 20,000 yuan. Finally, everyone calculated that increasing production can generate a total income of 328,000 yuan, and donating 93,000 yuan, plus saving and donating 26,000 yuan, a total of 119,000 yuan will be donated. My wife, hearing me calculate this way, said with a smile, "These methods are well thought out, and we can donate airplanes and cannons, and our family will have more income."

　　I remembered what the superiors said, that ensuring the realization of the patriotic production increase and donation plan, doing a good job in substitute farming, preventing sabotage by counter-revolutionaries, protecting the people's democratic dictatorship, and paying patriotic agricultural taxes well, all had to be included in the patriotic pact to ensure that they were done practically. After our discussion, we all agreed to do so. In addition, I thought that I am a correspondent for the Southern Jiangsu Daily, and I have to regularly reflect the opinions of the masses and promote reading the newspaper, which is my responsibility, so I added this clause to the patriotic pact. My son Wenjun, after hearing this, said to me, "Dad, you must be the first to abide by the patriotic pact, if you don't abide by it, everyone will not abide by it." I thought this was right, so I proposed to add another clause to the patriotic pact: "A family meeting will be held every ten days to check and urge everyone to abide by the patriotic pact." My wife also agreed very much.

　　At this time, I combined the opinions of the whole family and listed them into eight articles. The following is our family's patriotic pact:

　　1. Men should do their work well, and women should not hold them back; everyone should promote resisting America and aiding Korea.
　　2. Men should take care of the eight mu of paddy fields, ensuring that work does not interfere with production. Women should diligently do light work in the fields, raise pigs and sheep well, and take good care of the children.
　　3. Wenjun should study hard, not be absent from class or late. Pick up dog feces early every day, and help my mother cut one more basket of grass to feed the sheep after school in the evening.
　　4. Everyone should trace the source of rumors when they hear them. When strangers come to the village, secretly watch them and be careful to prevent sabotage by bandits and secret agents.
　　5. Take the lead in doing substitute farming, ensuring that military families are at ease. Take the lead in paying patriotic public grain, ensuring that it is paid quickly and well.
　　6. Increase production and donate 119,000 yuan to purchase airplanes and cannons, and this plan must be effectively completed.
　　7. Do not become divorced from the masses, report the opinions of the masses to the Southern Jiangsu Daily once a week, promote reading the newspaper, and regularly study current affairs, politics, and policies.
　　8. Hold a family meeting every ten days to check and urge everyone to implement the patriotic pact.

　　After our family established the patriotic pact, we truly improved our patriotic ideology, solved the problem of production and work not interfering with each other, and the couple no longer quarreled. The whole family became harmonious.

　　我们怎样订好了家庭爱国公约？
    杨伯容口述  伍阳整理
    编者按：苏南无锡新渎区和平村村长杨伯容，首先向妻子进行了抗美援朝的爱国教育，经全家讨论，订出了家庭爱国公约。订约时并讨论了增产捐献飞机大炮的办法，根据当前政治任务，联系本身工作、生产和学习，归纳为具体、简明的条文，并规定了检查的办法。这种作法，是可供各地群众，特别是区、村干部与积极分子学习的。但杨伯容家庭的爱国公约中，有一个缺点，就是没有把他们在家庭会议中已经确定了的生产的具体奋斗目标订进去。爱国丰产运动，是农村干部与群众最重要的任务之一，应该包括在爱国公约之内。
    我是无锡新渎区和平村的村长。七月三日，区里召开全区乡级和村级干部大会，确定把抗美援朝爱国主义教育的“空白村”、“空白人”消灭掉，动员订立或修订爱国公约，开展爱国增产捐献飞机大炮运动和做好代耕工作。环教导员在会上作了报告，他用例子说明：今天有些干部的家属也还不懂得抗美援朝。我一想，对啊，象我当了村长，我的女人张阿二，她就不懂得为什么要抗美援朝。我出来开会，她常常和我争吵，怪我“吃了自家饭，去干‘别人’的事体”。这有时也影响了我的工作。因此，我决定，先要对我女人进行宣传教育。
    回家以后，有一次，我和她在田里做活，我就从眼前小麦换米的事情讲起。我说：“今年人民政府收购小麦，一包小麦换一担米（反动政府统治时压低麦价，要三担麦才能换一石米），农民们个个不再吃小粥、麦麸。夏秋不但不会闹荒，而且有白米饭吃，没有共产党和人民政府，那来这种日子过。”接着，我就谈到美国鬼子正在侵略朝鲜，又在武装日本，一心想侵略我们中国，不让我们过好日子。它跟蒋介石、地主阶级、土匪特务都是“连裆裤”。我问她：“你是不是愿意吃第二遍苦呀？”她说：“只有死人才愿意，活人都不想再吃那个苦。”于是我就说：“要不吃苦头，就要抗美援朝，只有抗美援朝才能保家卫国，才能保牢我们的翻身果实，永远有好日子过。”以后，我又反复谈了些如何来抗美援朝的事情，把订爱国公约和增产捐献飞机大炮的意义也讲给她听。
    七月八日，我们一家人——我，张阿二，儿子文俊（十三岁，在念书），决定订一个家庭爱国公约。
    讨论订爱国公约时，我对我女人说：“我要保证把工作做好；你保证不拖腿，也就是为了抗美援朝。”她说：“好，我让你做工作，但是田里勿能荒。八亩水田你要负责做好，要是下午开会，上午就不要上街去闲荡，每天早晨早些起来下田。”儿子文俊也向我提意见。他说：“你工作不要拖拖沓沓，开会开完了就早些回来理理生产。”这些意见我接受了，而且订在爱国公约里。张阿二也把她保证要做的事讲出来。她说：“一定要把田里生活料理好，养好猪，养好羊，每天给羊割二篮草；三岁、五岁的两个小孩也要带好。”文俊也说：“要认真读书，保证不缺课，不迟到。早晨早起拾狗粪；放了晚学，帮娘多割一篮草喂羊。”这些都订上了爱国公约。
    讨论如何捐献飞机大炮时，张阿二首先提出来：她每月要替我做一双鞋子，过去都是请皮匠上底，现在自己上，每月节省一千元，半年就有六千元来捐献。我讲：“这样节省也好，但是还要从增加收入上来打算。”我提出来今年要早荡稻，多加水耘稻一次。去年荡稻请二个工，今年荡耘自家早起晚歇干，做得精细些，不请工，这样，八亩水田，每亩再增产十斤稻是办得到的（去年产量每亩稻五百五十斤，今年的计划增产一成要收六百零五斤，现在计划要收六百一十五斤）。大家都认为办得到，并决定每亩捐出五斤来。此外，大家又动动脑筋，决定在一亩桃田里，收过桃子以后，添种白菜和雪里红（去年未种过），可卖一担米，捐献二斗米。桃田周围的篱笆上，添种豇豆（去年未种过），熟后可卖二斗米，捐献二升。今年桃子已结桃，原计划可出二百斤桃，赶快上肥田粉，桃子结得大，可增产二十斤，共值人民币三万元。扣去买肥田粉的钱二万元，余一万元全部捐献。今年养的秋蚕，可产茧二十八斤；细心地好好养，多产茧二斤，捐献一斤。另外想到家里养有六只小鸡，有二只是雄鸡，原准备在今年过年时杀来吃，现在节约一只来捐献；同时把小鸡养好，半年后一只就有四斤重，值人民币二万元。末后，大家算了算，增加生产共可收入人民币三十二万八千元，捐献出九万三千元，加上节约捐献二万六千元，共捐献十一万九千元。我女人听我这样一算，笑嘻嘻地说：“这些办法想得好，又能够捐献飞机大炮，我们家里又多了一笔进账。”
    我想起上级说过的，要把保证实现爱国增产捐献计划，做好代耕工作，防止反革命分子破坏，保牢人民民主专政，缴好爱国农业税，都要订在爱国公约中，保证切切实实地做好。我们讨论以后，都同意这样做。另外我又想到我是苏南日报的通讯员，要经常反映群众意见和推动读报工作，这是我的责任，于是在爱国公约里又订上了这一条。小儿文俊听了以后，向我说：“爹，订了爱国公约你头一个要遵守，你不遵守，大家就不遵守了。”我想这话很对，于是提议在爱国公约上再补一条：“要每十天开家庭会一次，检查一下，督促大家遵守爱国公约。”我女人也很赞成。
    这时，我将全家的意见合拢来列成八条。下面就是我们全家的爱国公约：
    一、男人做好工作，女人不拖腿；大家都要宣传抗美援朝。
    二、八亩水田男的当，保证工作不误生产。女的勤做田里轻活，把猪羊养好，把小孩子带领好。
    三、文俊读书要认真，不缺课、不迟到。每天早起拾狗屎，放了晚学帮娘多割一篮喂羊草。
    四、大家听到谣言要追根。村子来了陌生人，暗暗看住他，小心防备土匪特务破坏。
    五、带头做好代耕，保证军属安心。带头缴爱国公粮，保证缴得又快又好。
    六、增产捐献十一万九千元购买飞机大炮，这计划要切实完成。
    七、不脱离群众，每周把群众意见向苏南日报汇报一次，推动读报工作，经常学习时事、政治和政策。
    八、每十天开家庭会一次，检查、督促大家执行爱国公约。
    我们家庭订好了爱国公约后，真正提高了爱国思想，生产与工作两不误的问题解决了，夫妇间也不再争吵了，一家子和和气气了。
