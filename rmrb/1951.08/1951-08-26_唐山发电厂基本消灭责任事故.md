　　The Tangshan Power Plant has created a new record of 292 days of safe power generation. The plant won the championship in the safe power generation competition among Tianjin, Taiyuan, Qingdao and other power plants in the first and second quarters of this year.

　　In the past, the plant had frequent accidents, with six power outages before May of last year. In order to reduce and eliminate accidents, in May of last year, the plant held a technical crash course training class, absorbing the majority of employees to participate in learning, so that they understood the structure of the generator and simple principles, and familiarized themselves with the various standard operating methods of power generation. On this basis, in September of last year, the plant held a plant-wide safety inspection. Ninety-five percent of the plant's employees participated in the safety inspection, identifying a total of 1,090 incidents that had occurred or were about to occur. This inspection aroused the attention of all employees to safe production and strengthened their confidence in eliminating accidents. Since then, safe production has become the central work of the plant. In addition to designating the safety inspection as an annual system, the plant has also established many systems and methods for daily safety assurance. These systems and methods have become the key to the plant's basic elimination of accidents. The main systems and methods include: the responsibility system and shift handover system, the weekly safety inspection system, and the weekly production self-inspection meeting, etc.

　　Because the plant has basically eliminated accidents, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Electric Power Industry Trade Union recently presented a prize flag to commend them.

　　唐山发电厂基本消灭责任事故
    唐山发电厂已创造了二百九十二天安全发电的新纪录。该厂在本年第一、二季度和天津、太原、青岛等电厂的安全发电竞赛中，连获优胜。
    过去该厂曾不断地发生事故，去年五月以前就发生过六次停电事故。为了减少和消灭事故，去年五月，该厂举办了一个技术速成训练班，吸收绝大部分职工参加学习，使他们了解了发电机的构造和简单的原理，并熟悉了发电的各种正规操作方法。在这个基础之上，去年九月该厂又举行了一次全厂性的安全大检查。全厂有百分之九十五的职工参加了安全大检查，一共检查出已发生和将会发生的事故一千零九十件。这次检查引起了全体职工对安全生产的重视，加强了消灭事故的信心。以后，安全生产就成为全厂的中心工作。该厂除把安全大检查定为一年一度的制度外，又订立了许多关于日常保证安全的制度和办法。这些制度和办法成为该厂基本上消灭事故的关键。主要的制度和办法有：责任制和交接班制，每周一次的安全检查制，每周一次的生产自我检查会等。
    由于该厂已做到基本上消灭事故，中央人民政府燃料工业部和全国电业工会最近特赠送奖旗，予以表扬。
