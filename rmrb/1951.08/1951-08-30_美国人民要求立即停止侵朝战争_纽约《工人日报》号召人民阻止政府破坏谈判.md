Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 29th: The New York "Daily Worker" reported: "The chairman of the 'American Peace Crusade,' Richardson, and Pastor Ufas issued a statement on August 23rd stating: 'The recent crisis in Kaesong most conclusively proves that as long as the war continues, the armistice negotiations are in danger of breaking down.'"
    They announced that they would launch a ceasefire movement in the week starting September 2nd. At that time, cars with ceasefire flags and carrying propagandists and printed materials will parade through various districts, towns, and beaches of New York, publicizing the need to immediately promote a ceasefire in Korea. Similar propaganda vehicles are already active in Los Angeles and Newark.
    According to the "Canadian Forum," the executive committee of the Canadian branch of the International Union of United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, which has 27,000 members, expressed serious concern at its meeting on August 18th that the war in Korea was still continuing during the armistice negotiations.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: Telepress, New York: The New York "Daily Worker" published a commentary on August 24th regarding the interruption of the Kaesong negotiations. The newspaper warned: "A large-scale international deception is clearly being manufactured."
    The newspaper mentioned that Secretary of State Acheson testified at the U.S. Senate's investigation of the MacArthur affair that the United States was willing to end the Korean War at the 38th parallel. The newspaper compared this statement with General Ridgway's statement refusing to conclude a ceasefire agreement along the 38th parallel, and said that regardless of the reason for this contradiction, "whether it is a deliberately fabricated false promise or a later-arranged deception, this kind of diplomacy in Washington not only isolates our country from the only reasonable common will of all mankind, but also subjects our people to a failure of unlimited magnitude."
    The editorial concluded: "We call for the immediate launch of a broad popular intervention movement, calling on the people to send telegrams and letters to President Truman, congressmen, and senators, urging an immediate ceasefire along the line originally guaranteed by Secretary of State Acheson and agreed to by the National Defense Council headed by Bradley and Marshall. If we allow the merchants of death and warmongering generals to deprive us of the opportunity to seek peace, then we cannot blame others, but only ourselves."

　　美国人民要求立即停止侵朝战争
    纽约《工人日报》号召人民阻止政府破坏谈判
    【新华社布拉格二十九日电】纽约《工人日报》报道：“美国和平十字军”主席李查逊与牧师乌法斯在八月二十三日发表声明称：“最近在开城发生的危机最确凿地证明了：只要战事继续打下去，停战谈判就处在破裂的危险中”。
    他们宣布要在九月二日起的一周中发动一个要求停火运动。到那时，插着要求停火的旗帜、载着宣传员与印刷品的汽车将在纽约各区、各乡镇与海滩游行，宣传立即促成朝鲜停火之必要。同样的宣传车现在已经在洛杉矶与涅瓦克开始活动了。
    另据《加拿大论坛报》报道：拥有二万七千会员的美国国际联合电气、无线电与机器工人工会加拿大分会的执行委员会在八月十八日的会议上对停战谈判期间朝鲜境内战争仍在继续，表示严重忧虑。
    【新华社二十九日讯】电通社纽约讯：纽约《工人日报》于八月二十四日就开城谈判的中断发表评论。该报警告说：“一个国际性的大规模骗局显然在制造中。”
    该报提到国务卿艾奇逊在美国参议院对麦克阿瑟事件的调查会上曾作证说：美国愿意在三八线上结束朝鲜战争。该报把这个声明与李奇微将军拒绝缔结沿三八线停火协定的声明作一对比，并且说，不论这种矛盾的原因是什么，“是一个蓄意编造的虚假诺言也好，是一个后来布置的骗局也好，华盛顿这种外交不但使我国自绝于全人类唯一合理的公意，而且也使我国人民遭到一个无限规模的失败”。
    社论最后说：“我们号召立即发起一个广大的人民干预运动，号召人民纷纷向杜鲁门总统，众议员们与参议员们发出电报与信件，敦促立即按照国务卿艾奇逊原来保证的并曾得到以布莱德雷与马歇尔为首的全国防务委员会同意的界线上停火。如果我们让死亡贩子与好战将军们剥夺我们谋求和平的机会，那么我们就不能怪别人，而只能怪自己了。”
