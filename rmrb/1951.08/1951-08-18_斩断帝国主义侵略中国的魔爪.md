The Military Control Commission Military Tribunal of Beijing, based on the indictment by the Beijing People's Procuratorate, sentenced those involved in the major American spy plot to instigate armed rebellion. This is an important event in our people's struggle against American aggression and in defense of the motherland, and a major victory on the "invisible front." This victory demonstrates that the liberated Chinese people have not only shattered the shackles that imperialism has imposed on the Chinese people for over a century, but are also determined to completely sever any and all imperialist claws of aggression against China, and are fully capable of doing so!

This group of American special agent spies are some of the imperialist claws of aggression against China. Their crimes are extremely serious. They spied on our national secrets, hid military weapons, and plotted armed rebellion. They had planned to shell the Tiananmen reviewing stand on October 1st last year, our National Day, attempting to assassinate our head of state and other leaders of the Central People's Government. No one among the Chinese people can fail to express extreme hatred for their mad and vicious criminal conspiracy.

The heinous American special agent spies Li An-dong, Yamaguchi Ryuichi, Madi Nao, Wei Zhi, as well as Gansner, Zhe Li, Ma Xinqing and other criminals have confessed all their crimes and revealed their American command organs. The large quantities of military weapons, poisons, plans of violence, and intelligence drafts seized in the criminals' homes have also fully proven that this large-scale special agent spy case was carried out under the command of the former U.S. Strategic Intelligence Agency, the U.S. occupation army headquarters in Tokyo, and the U.S. Embassy's military attache's office in Beijing. This group of special agent spies directed by U.S. government agencies used all kinds of sinister and vicious means to carry out the bloody aggression and sabotage plans of American imperialism. In their reports to the U.S. occupation army headquarters in Tokyo, they even arrogantly stated that they would launch a large-scale "challenge" to the Chinese people and the People's Republic of China. However, their criminal plans have been completely defeated in the face of the Chinese people. Our public security organs, after long and systematic reconnaissance, cracked this major counter-revolutionary case on September 26th of last year. This once again demonstrates that the strength of the Chinese people who have stood up is great and inviolable.

The Chinese people must maintain the highest degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of imperialism, especially American imperialism, to invade and sabotage our country, and resolutely strike against them. All the evidence of Li An-dong, Yamaguchi Ryuichi, and other criminals further demonstrates that the conspiracy of American imperialism to invade and sabotage our country is intensifying day by day. Under the direction of American spy agencies, this group of criminals, before and after the liberation of Beijing, spied on and stole a large amount of important military, political, and economic intelligence from our liberated areas, and provided it to American spy agencies; they spied on the lists of leaders of our Central People's Government and various departments, various democratic parties, and democratic personages, and recorded items such as addresses, telephone numbers, and car numbers, made into cards (210 of which were seized), waiting for opportunities to carry out sabotage or assassination; they stored potassium cyanide and other highly toxic poisons, preparing to carry out poisoning; they drew up diagrams of shelling Tiananmen, and hid a 60mm mortar, pistols and hand grenades, shells and various bullets, more than 500 pieces in total, preparing for armed rebellion. Not only that, but among the evidence already seized, there are also more than 20 secret letters from American special agent chief Paul Reider to them. Can't these ironclad proofs raise our vigilance a thousandfold? Isn't the heinous conspiracy of the U.S. government and the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo to harm our country clearly revealed? The evidence of crimes committed by Li An-dong and others is only a small part of the evidence of the crimes committed by the U.S. government and the U.S. military organs in our country; however, even these evidences are enough to expose the bloody butcher's face of the U.S. government's hostility towards China.

The U.S. government still shamelessly promotes its "civilization" and its "friendship" with China. May I ask the U.S. government for an explanation of this base and despicable jackal behavior directly commanded by the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo and the U.S. military attache? Let all those who still have illusions about American capitalist civilization see: this is American "civilization"! This is American "friendship"!

The people of the world can clearly see from this case that the American imperialists have completely inherited the mantle of fascism. They have taken over all the accomplices left by Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki, the public enemies of all mankind, such as the Italian fascist Li An-dong and the Japanese special agent Yamaguchi Ryuichi in this case. The fascist special agent Li An-dong wrote to the American special agent chief Paul Reider on November 11, 1948, saying: "I am very willing to serve the United States, the recognized leader of the anti-communist camp." This is exactly the case. American imperialism has become the "recognized leader" of all fascist remnants and bandits after World War II; the deceased Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo Hideki and others have found American imperialists as their posthumous children.

The case of Li An-dong and Yamaguchi Ryuichi has more clearly demonstrated that American imperialism is the Chinese people's irreconcilable and vicious enemy. However, the Chinese people that American imperialism is encountering now are no longer comparable to the past. We, the Chinese people, have bravely stood up, resolutely opposed American aggression, defended world peace, defended our great motherland, and consolidated the system of the people's democratic dictatorship. We will never allow any murderous and arsonist imperialist bandits to invade our people's free and happy lives again. We will never allow American vicious spies to remain on Chinese soil. No Chinese is allowed to have any contact with the deadly enemy of the Chinese people, the American imperialist forces and American spy agencies. If any imperialist spy agency tries to extend its claws into our country, we will definitely sever them.

The verdict of the Beijing Military Control Commission Military Tribunal on the case of the American spy plot to instigate armed rebellion is a correct measure that fully meets the requirements of the Chinese people. Our people should draw profound lessons from this case, universally intensify our serious struggle against American aggression, against imperialist elements and their running dogs, to eliminate espionage activities, safeguard national security, and keep state secrets.

### 斩断帝国主义侵略中国的魔爪

　　斩断帝国主义侵略中国的魔爪
    北京市军事管制委员会军法处，依据北京市人民检察署的起诉，判处了美国间谍阴谋武装暴动的巨大案件。这是我国人民在反对美国侵略、保卫祖国的斗争中一个重要的事件，这是在“无形战线”上的一个重大胜利。这个胜利说明，解放了的中国人民，不但已经粉碎了帝国主义百余年来加在中国人民身上的枷锁，而且对于任何帝国主义侵略中国的一切魔爪，都一定要把它们彻底斩断，并且是完全能够把它们彻底斩断的！
    这一批美国的特务间谍，就是美帝国主义侵略中国的一些魔爪。他们的罪恶是极端严重的。他们刺探我国家机密、隐藏军火武器，阴谋武装暴动。他们曾有计划地准备在去年十月一日我国的国庆节，炮轰天安门检阅台，企图以此来杀害我国家元首和中央人民政府其他各首长。对于他们这样疯狂凶恶的罪恶阴谋，全中国人民，没有一个人能不表示极端的痛恨。
    万恶的美国特务间谍李安东、山口隆一、马迪懦、魏智以及甘斯纳、哲立、马新清等罪犯已经供出了他们的全部罪状和他们的美国指挥机关。在罪犯家中搜出的大批军火武器、毒药、暴行计划和情报底稿等大量罪证也已经完全证明，这个规模巨大的特务间谍案，是先后在美国战略情报局、东京美国占领军总部、前美国大使馆驻北京武官处指挥之下进行的。这一批美国政府机关所指挥的特务间谍，用尽一切阴险毒辣的手段，执行着美帝国主义血腥的侵略计划和破坏计划。他们向美国在东京的占领军总部所做的报告中，竟狂妄地表示他们要向我中国人民和中华人民共和国进行一次大规模的“挑战”。但是，他们的罪恶计划，在中国人民面前，已经彻底地失败了。我人民公安机关，在经过长期系统地侦察后，于去年九月二十六日，即破获了这个巨大的反革命案件。这又一次地说明了，站起来的中国人民的力量是伟大的和不可侵犯的。
    中国人民对于帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义力图侵略与破坏我国的阴谋，必须随时保持最高度的警惕，并予以坚决的打击。李安东、山口隆一等这一批罪犯的一切罪证，都更加足以说明美帝国主义处心积虑侵略和破坏我国的阴谋，是日甚一日的。这一批罪犯在美国间谍机关指使之下，在北京解放前后，大量刺探和窃取了我解放区的军事、政治、经济等重要情报，供给了美国间谍机关；他们刺探了我中央人民政府和各部门首长、各民主党派及民主人士的名单，并且记录了住址、电话和汽车号码等项，制成卡片（被搜出的有二百一十张），伺机进行破坏或暗杀；他们储藏了青酸钾等烈性毒药，准备进行放毒；他们绘制了炮轰天安门的图样，隐藏了六○迫击炮一门、手枪和手榴弹、炮弹及各种子弹等五百余件，准备武装暴动。不但这样，在已搜出的他们的罪证中，还有美国特务头目包瑞德发给他们的秘密信件二十多件。这些铁证，难道还能不千百倍地提高我们的警惕吗？美国政府和东京美军总部穷凶极恶地危害我国的阴谋，还不是昭然若揭了吗？李安东等犯的罪证，只不过是美国政府和美国军事机关在我国罪行证据的一小部分；但是，就是这些罪证，已经足够暴露美国政府敌视中国的血腥屠夫的面目了。
    美国政府至今还经常无耻地宣传它的“文明”，宣传它对中国的“友好”。请问美国政府对于这种由东京美军总部和美国武官所直接指挥的卑鄙下流的豺狼行为有何解释？一切对美国资本主义文明还抱有幻想的人们请看吧：这就是美国的“文明”！这就是美国的“友好”！
    全世界人民可以从这个案件清楚地看到：美帝国主义者完全承袭了法西斯的衣钵。他们把全人类的公敌希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机遗留下来的徒党，例如本案中的意大利法西斯分子李安东和日本特务山口隆一，全部接收过来了。法西斯特务间谍李安东，于一九四八年十一月十一日写给美国特务头目包瑞德的信中说：“我很愿意为反共阵营公认的盟主美国效劳。”正是如此。美帝国主义在第二次世界大战后，已成为一切法西斯残余匪帮“公认的盟主”；已经死去的希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机之流，已经找到美帝国主义者作为自己的遗腹子了。
    李安东、山口隆一的案件，已经再明显不过地证明：美帝国主义是全中国人民的不共戴天的凶恶仇敌。但是，美帝国主义现在所遇到的中国人民，却已经不是过去所可比拟的了。我们中国人民已经勇敢地站了起来，坚决地反对美国侵略，保卫世界和平，保卫我们伟大的祖国，巩固人民民主专政的制度。我们决不容许任何杀人放火的帝国主义盗匪，再来侵犯我国人民自由幸福的生活。我们决不容许在中国的土地上再保留美国的凶恶的间谍分子。任何中国人决不容许和中国人民的死敌美国帝国主义势力和美国间谍机关发生任何联系。任何帝国主义间谍机关要在我国的土地上伸进它的魔爪，我们就一定要把它斩断。
    北京市军事管制委员会军法处，判决美国间谍阴谋武装暴动的案件，是完全符合中国人民要求的正确措施。我国人民应当从这个案件中得到深刻的教训，普遍地加紧我们反对美国侵略、反对帝国主义分子及其走狗、扑灭间谍活动、保卫国家安全、保守国家机密的严肃斗争。
