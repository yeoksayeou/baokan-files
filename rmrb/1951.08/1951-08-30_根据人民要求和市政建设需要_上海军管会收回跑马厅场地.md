Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 29th. The Shanghai Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued an order on August 27th to recover all land originally operated by the British Shanghai Race Club, Shanghai Racecourse Grounds Co., Ltd., and the British Shanghai International Recreation Club, located south of Nanjing West Road, west of Xizang Middle Road, north of Wusheng Road, and east of Huangpi North Road in Shanghai. This measure is implemented based on the demands of the people and the needs of municipal construction. The Shanghai Military Control Commission is drafting a plan for gradual reconstruction to make this central square suitable for the needs of Shanghai's municipal construction and people's activities in the future.

　　The above-mentioned site, totaling 519.752 mu, is located in the center of Shanghai and is commonly known as the "Racecourse." During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, British imperialists, relying on their military force, forcibly occupied the farmland and graveyards of Chinese farmers within the enclosure by coercive means or at extremely low prices, and forced the residents within the enclosure to relocate, turning the site into a place for horse racing and gambling. After 1941, the site was used as barracks by Japanese and American imperialists successively. Since the liberation of Shanghai, this site has been used as a place for large-scale gatherings of the people of Shanghai.

　　根据人民要求和市政建设需要
    上海军管会收回跑马厅场地
    【新华社上海二十九日电】中国人民解放军上海市军事管制委员会于八月二十七日下令收回上海市南京西路以南、西藏中路以西、武胜路以北、黄陂北路以东，原由英商上海跑马总会有限公司、上海跑马总会场地有限公司及英商上海万国运动会所经营的全部土地。这一措施是根据人民的要求和市政建设的需要而实施的。上海市军事管制委员会正在拟订逐步改建的计划，使这个中心的广场，适合于今后上海市政建设及人民活动的需要。
    上述场地共五百一十九点七五二市亩，位于上海市中心，俗称“跑马厅”。太平天国革命时期，英国帝国主义者依靠其武力，以强迫占领的手段或以极低的价钱，把圈内的中国农民的田地和坟地强占下来，并强迫圈内居民迁移，把该场地辟为跑马赌博的场所。一九四一年以后，该场所曾先后作为日、美帝国主义的兵营。上海解放以后，这块场地已作为上海人民经常举行大规模集会的地方。
