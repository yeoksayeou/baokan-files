Xinhua News Agency, July 7th—Since the Soviet Union's representative to the United Nations, Malik, proposed a peaceful resolution to the Korean War on June 23rd, and the warring parties in Korea accepted Malik's proposal and began armistice negotiations, the heads of the US government, starting with President Truman, have successively issued many statements over the past month. These statements have not only failed to create any atmosphere conducive to the success of the Korean negotiations but, on the contrary, have wantonly insulted the efforts of the Soviet Union, China, and the Korean people to achieve peace, and have vigorously incited a tense war atmosphere, making it impossible for people not to doubt whether the US government is sincere about the current Korean armistice negotiations.

In the six weeks since June 23rd, US President Truman has delivered four speeches. Each was filled with malicious provocation. In his speech in Washington on July 4th, Truman emphasized: "Korea is only part of a wider conflict... We cannot ignore the danger of military events breaking out in other parts of the world." "We face a long-term global tension and a huge international danger."

During the same period, US Secretary of State Acheson made even more public speeches than Truman. Particularly blatant was Acheson's speech on July 24th. In this important speech, which was described by the reactionary American newspapers as programmatic, the US Secretary of State shamelessly threatened the American people, saying: "We are in great danger... This danger is no less than it was a month ago, although it seems that some of us think so. ... Make no mistake - this is a very critical time. Our country is facing an unprecedentedly serious critical time."

The Director of the US Defense Mobilization Agency, Wilson, also publicly demanded, in his capacity as a senior government official, that the American people not expect any results from the armistice negotiations, and he frantically clamored that the American people should not "indulge in a false sense of security" and should not place their confidence solely on "hopes for diplomatic victory." Marshall himself was particularly blatant. In order to create artificial panic, he said arbitrarily on July 18th: "The possibility of a full-scale war continues to exist, and... this possibility is increasing."

When the people of the world are hoping that the peace in Korea can be realized through this armistice negotiation, this series of speeches full of gunpowder from the heads of the Truman government can only show that the US government completely lacks the sincerity necessary for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War. In fact, Marshall himself revealed the conspiracy of the United States to try to delay and obstruct this negotiation as much as possible. According to the Associated Press, in his speech on July 18th, Marshall predicted: "It will probably take more than six weeks for the Korean talks to produce results, which will be in early September." Marshall, with the logic peculiar to war profiteers, stated that in order for the Korean talks to produce results, the US Congress must pass huge military expenditures. According to him, this "will greatly help the United States (in Kaesong) to obtain the decision it hopes for." Regarding this point, a press release published by the United States Information Service on July 30th, introducing the work of Congress, revealed: "The goal of congressional leaders is to adjourn in September. Congressmen must pass four important bills that 'must' be passed before they can go home." The so-called four bills that "must" be passed are the 66.5 billion US dollar military budget for 1952, which is currently awaiting passage by Congress, the bill to increase taxes by 10 billion US dollars for 1952, the 8.5 billion US dollar so-called "Common Security Act," and the "Defense Production Act," which has already been passed by Congress at the end of July.

The facts are very clear. The US government does not want to work for the rapid realization of peace in Korea in the Kaesong negotiations. On the contrary, it is trying to delay and obstruct this negotiation in order to maintain a wartime state of tension and facilitate its intensified global preparations for war at home and abroad. This attitude of the US government is something that peace-loving people all over the world cannot ignore.

### 美国政府缺乏和平解决朝鲜战争诚意  杜鲁门等连续发表挑衅言论

　　美国政府缺乏和平解决朝鲜战争诚意
    杜鲁门等连续发表挑衅言论
    【新华社七日讯】自从苏联驻联合国代表马立克在六月二十三日提出和平解决朝鲜战争的建议，朝鲜交战双方接受了马立克的建议而开始举行停战谈判以来，美国政府首脑，自总统杜鲁门以下，在一个多月中，已连续发表了许多言论。这些言论不仅没有造成任何有利于朝鲜谈判成功的气氛，而且相反地肆意侮蔑苏联、中国与朝鲜人民为实现和平而作的努力，竭力煽动紧张的战争空气，使得人们不能不怀疑美国政府到底对目前的朝鲜停战谈判是否具有诚意。
    从六月二十三日以来的六个星期中，美国总统杜鲁门已先后发表了四篇演说。每一篇都充满了恶意的挑衅，杜鲁门在七月四日在华盛顿发表的演说中强调：“朝鲜只是更广泛的冲突的一部分……我们不能忽视在世界上其他地方可能爆发军事事件的危险。”“我们面临着一个长期的世界紧张局面，和巨大的国际危险。”
    在同一期间，美国国务卿艾奇逊向公众发表的演说比杜鲁门还要多。其中特别露骨的是艾奇逊七月二十四日发表的演说。在这篇被美国反动报纸称为具有纲领意义的重要演说中，这位美国国务卿居然无耻地恫吓美国人说：“我们正处在很大的危险中……这种危险不比一个月以前小，虽然看起来，我们中间有些人这样想。……不要弄错——这是一个非常时期。我国面临的空前严重的非常时期。”
    美国国防动员署署长威尔生也在七月九日以政府大员的身份，公然要求美国人民不要希望停战谈判会有什么结果，并疯狂地叫嚣美国人民不要“沉醉在错误的安全感中”，不要把他们的信心单单寄托在“外交胜利的希望上”。马歇尔自己说得特别露骨。为了制造人为的恐慌，他在七月十八日信口开河地说：“全面战争的可能性继续存在，而且……这个可能性正在增加。”
    当全世界人民盼望着经过这次停战谈判使朝鲜的和平得以实现的时候，杜鲁门政府首脑这一连串充满了火药气味的言论，只能说明美国政府完全缺乏为和平解决朝鲜战争所必需的诚意。实际上，马歇尔自己也透露了美国企图尽量拖延和阻挠这个谈判的阴谋。据合众社称：就在七月十八日的发言中马歇尔预告：“朝鲜和谈要有结果，大概需时六星期以上，那将在九月初。”马歇尔以其战争贩子所特有的逻辑表示，要使朝鲜和谈有结果，美国国会就必须通过庞大的各项军费，据他说，这“将大有助于美国（在开城）获得它所希望的决定”。关于这一点，美国新闻处在七月三十日发表的一篇介绍国会工作的新闻资料曾经透露：“国会领袖的目标是希望在九月间休会，国会议员必须通过四项‘必须’通过的重要法案后才能回家。”所谓四项“必须”通过的法案，就是现在正待国会通过的一九五二年度六百六十五亿美元军费预算案，一九五二年度增税一百亿美元的法案，八十五亿美元的所谓“共同安全法案”，和已被国会在七月底通过的“国防生产法”。
    事实很明显，美国政府在开城谈判中并不想为朝鲜和平的迅速实现而努力，相反，它正企图拖延和阻挠这个谈判，以保持战时紧张状态，便利其在国内和国外加紧从事世界的备战部署。美国政府的这种态度是全世界爱好和平的人民所决不能漠视的。
