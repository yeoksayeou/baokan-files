The Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council
Proposal for Establishing the Central School for Political and Legal Cadres
Approved by the 94th Government Affairs Meeting of the Government Administration Council on July 20, 1951

I. In order to meet the needs of national construction and strengthen the work of the people's democratic government, it is urgently necessary to train a large number of political and legal cadres. This training matter was clearly stipulated as one of the important current work tasks in the report of the Committee on the situation and current tasks of political and legal work, which was approved and promulgated by the Government Administration Council's order on May 21 of this year. In order to complete this task, it is proposed to establish the Central School for Political and Legal Cadres according to the prescribed policy. The primary goal is to select and train administrative and judicial work cadres from counties (cities), and to cultivate a group of teachers for political and legal education, in order to gain experience in teaching content and methods, and to promote and assist the development of political and legal cadre training work in various regions.

II. The Central School for Political and Legal Cadres will be under the direct leadership of this Committee. Deputy Director Peng Zhen is recommended as Principal, and Deputy Director Zhang Xiruo, Minister Xie Juezai, Minister Shi Liang, and Secretary-General Tao Xijin are recommended as Vice-Principals. Secretary-General Tao Xijin will also serve as Dean of Academic Affairs. A school affairs committee will be established, with the Principal and Vice-Principals as ex officio members. Wu Yuzhang, Shen Junru, Tan Pingshan, Li Liuru, Luo Ruiqing, Xu Deheng, Zeng Zhaolun, Chen Yuan, Ai Siqi, and others are invited to serve as members. It is proposed that the Government Administration Council appoint the Principal, Vice-Principals, and members of the School Affairs Committee. The school headquarters will have a Deputy Dean of Academic Affairs and sections/offices for organization and training, teaching and research, and administration. In addition to requesting the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government to allocate personnel as appropriate, most personnel will be drawn from various political and legal departments, and the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government will be requested to assist in organizing a group of political and legal educators to participate in teaching and research work.

III. Training targets: mainly leading cadres of county (city) people's governments, and responsible persons of (county and city) courts, procuratorates, supervisory committees, and public security bureaus. The second priority is to rotate and train incumbent cadres of political and legal departments above the special district level; and to cultivate political and legal educators and propaganda workers. In addition, some workers and peasants with certain qualifications, former judicial personnel, and new intellectuals will be recruited and trained in appropriate phases. The different focuses and proportions of training targets in each phase will be determined by the School Affairs Committee based on the situation and tasks.

IV. Training methods:

(1) Training duration: six to eight months.

(2) Teaching content: Adopting the principle of combining theory with practice and focusing on essentials, to achieve a more systematic and clear understanding of the basic policies of our country and the professional knowledge of various political and legal tasks. Therefore, the order of teaching courses is divided into: theory of class, theory of state, state law, introduction to administrative work, introduction to judicial work, and various policies and regulations. At the same time, in accordance with the teaching sequence, reports and special lectures on current political tasks and ideological construction related to consolidating and developing the people's democratic dictatorship will be coordinated. Specific subjects related to professional teaching can be used as specialized courses. The above courses are planned to be compiled into teaching materials. In the first phase of training, the method of combining compilation, teaching, and learning will be adopted, and efforts will be made to gradually enrich the teaching materials.

(3) Instructors: In addition to hiring specialists to lecture on various courses, central leaders and heads of central political and legal business departments will be invited to give reports and special lectures.

(4) Organize a group of professors and lecturers from university political and legal departments and those interested in engaging in political and legal propaganda and education work to participate in teaching research or teaching material compilation and review.

    关于筹设中央政法干部学校方案
    一九五一年七月二十日政务院第九十四次政务会议批准
    一、为了适应国家建设、加强人民民主政权工作的需要，亟应大批训练政法工作干部。此项训练事宜，在政务院本年五月二十一日命令批准公布实行的本委关于政法工作的情况和目前任务的报告中，并已明确规定了这是当前的重要工作任务之一。为着完成这一任务，拟即按照规定方针，筹设中央政法干部学校，首先是抽调训练县（市）行政工作和司法工作干部，并培养一部分政法教育工作的师资，以便取得教学内容和教学方法的经验，推动与协助各地对政法干部训练工作的开展。
    二、中央政法干部学校，受本委直接领导。推彭真副主任为校长，张奚若副主任、谢觉哉部长、史良部长、陶希晋秘书长四人为副校长，陶希晋秘书长并兼教务长。另设校务委员会，除校长、副校长为当然委员外，另请吴玉章、沈钧儒、谭平山、李六如、罗瑞卿、许德珩、曾昭抡、陈垣、艾思奇等为委员。校长、副校长、校务委员会各委员均拟请政务院加以任命。校部设副教务长及组训、教研、行政等组、处，其人员除请中央人民政府人事部酌予调充外，大部由政法各部门抽调，并请中央人民政府教育部协助组织一批政法教育工作者参加教研工作。
    三、训练对象：主要为县（市）人民政府之主要干部，及（县市）法院、检察署、监察委员会和公安局等负责人员，其次为轮训专署以上的政法部门之在职干部；培养政法教育工作者与宣传工作者。此外，并适当分期招收一些有一定条件的工农干部、旧司法人员和新知识分子加以训练。各期训练对象不同的重点和比例，由校务委员会依据情况和任务决定之。
    四、训练办法：
    （一）训练时间：六个月至八个月。
    （二）教学内容：采取理论与实际相结合及少而精的原则，求得关于我们国家各项基本政策及政法各项工作的业务知识有较系统的、明确的认识。因此教学课程顺序分为：阶级论、国家论、国家法、行政工作概论、司法工作概论及各项政策法令，同时参照教学顺序配合有关巩固与发展人民民主专政的当前政治任务和思想建设的报告和专题讲演。其中有关业务教学的具体课目，得作为分科的专修课程。以上各项课程均拟编成教材。在第一期训练时，采取编、教、学三者结合进行的方法，力求教材逐步充实。
    （三）教员：除聘请专人分别担任各课程主讲外，并拟请中央负责人及中央政法业务部门负责人作报告和专题讲演。
    （四）组织一批大学政法学系教授、讲师及有志从事政法宣教工作者参加教学研究或教材编审工作。
