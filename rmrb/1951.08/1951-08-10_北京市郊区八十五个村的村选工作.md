Village Election Work in Eighty-Five Villages in the Suburbs of Beijing
Beijing Suburban Work Committee

After the district people's representative conferences were held in various districts of Beijing in mid-March, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Government, the mass movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries were launched to promote agricultural and sideline production in the suburbs. Village people's representative conferences or farmer representative conferences were generally held in various villages, which enhanced the political awareness of the masses and set off a vigorous patriotic production increase movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries. The suburban agricultural production plan to increase production by 50% in 1951 was fully guaranteed. After the second district people's representative conference in June, with the active efforts of all the representatives, a large-scale mass movement of patriotic production increase donation and wheat pre-lending was launched. More than 400,000 farmers in the suburbs had pledged donations of 3.2 billion yuan in half a month from June 15th to June 30th. The wheat pre-lending work also ended in an unprecedentedly smooth manner. From July 1st to 11th, six districts had completed the storage, and it is estimated that more than 90% of the villages can exceed the pre-lending task. In these mass movements, many representatives played a great role, and a large number of activists and model figures emerged, presenting a new atmosphere in the countryside. The above situation shows that the people's representative conference system is the best organizational form for improving leadership, contacting the masses, completing tasks, and doing good work; it is also the most scientific and successful way of working to carry out all major work through the people's representative conference.

In order to carry out the work of electing the village people's government prudently and steadily, the Suburban Work Committee and the people's governments of various districts first conducted typical experiments with emphasis and gained certain experience. Then, village people's congresses were held in 85 administrative villages in the suburbs (a total of 256 villages, 10 towns, and 15 street people's governments) to elect the village people's government and elect the village head and deputy village head and village people's government committee members who are supported and loved by the people. The specific experience is:

(1) In the election, we promoted democracy, boldly mobilized the masses, listened to the opinions of the masses, and elected 196 village heads and deputy village heads and 580 village people's government committee members, and organized the new village people's government. The emergence of these village heads and committee members was the result of full deliberation, repeated discussion, evaluation, and screening by people's representatives and the people for a long time (six or seven days). After the representatives put forward the list of candidates, they were elected by a show of hands.

Looking at the composition of the 776 village cadres, middle peasants accounted for 35% (originally 29%); poor peasants accounted for 56% (originally 62%); hired farm laborers accounted for 5% (originally 6%); winter school teachers and small handicraft workers accounted for 4% (originally 3%). From a gender perspective, women accounted for 9% (originally 1%). Compared with the original village people's government, the representativeness is more extensive, and the foundation of the rural united front is more consolidated and expanded.

Experience has proved that it is correct to let the masses choose for themselves, put forward a list of candidates according to the wishes of the masses, and then the work team will study and guide them. Except for individual candidates who may have major political problems, they should resolutely support the masses. This is a correct democratic practice, which is in line with the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses." On the contrary, the election preparatory committee of Yimuyuan Village in the 13th district first proposed a list of seven candidates. After announcing it to the masses, public opinion was in an uproar. The masses said, "If you decide, we don't need to vote!" Seeing that things were not good, the work team immediately declared it invalid, but after letting the masses elect freely, the result was the same as the list, only replacing a more suitable committee member.

The election methods of nominating as many candidates as there are positions and voting by show of hands are the simplest, most accurate, and easiest to implement, and are most popular among the peasant masses. The peasants said, "This kind of election is just right for us," because the candidates have been fully deliberated, and the masses have considered them carefully and their opinions are concentrated. This election method is most convenient to ensure the opinions of the masses. Failure to do so in individual places will lead to failure.

(2) The eyes of the masses are discerning, the identification of village cadres is correct, and the rewards and punishments of the masses are also clear. According to the statistics of 85 villages, there were 459 village cadres (village head and deputy village head, civil affairs, finance and food, culture and education, production, public security, etc.) before the election. 138 people failed to be re-elected this time (including 21 village heads and 23 deputy village heads). Among them, 19 were illegal and derelict, 32 had bad work styles, 53 were not responsible in their work, 9 had political problems, 14 resigned due to poor ability and family difficulties, and 11 were too old, too young, had mental illnesses, or had moved away. At the same time, 321 village cadres were re-elected because they were active, capable, and had a good work style and prestige among the masses (including 48 village heads and 46 deputy village heads). In addition, 13 village heads were demoted because of their poor ability, passive work, and not very good work style, and 9 deputy village heads and 17 village government committee members were promoted. The above figures show that the masses will never simply attack the village cadres who serve them, but will adopt the cadre policy of affirming achievements, criticizing shortcomings, correcting mistakes, punishing crimes, and treating diseases and saving people. There are very many vivid examples of the masses using concrete facts to educate village cadres to correct their mistakes at the election meeting. For example, Li Yongjiang, the village head of Xihuang Village, used to be active and responsible in his work, but his methods were simple and he liked to show his attitude, so his relationship with the masses was not good. This time, the representatives raised their opinions to him at the meeting, and he himself also made a profound self-criticism. Seeing that he was willing to accept criticism, the masses still elected him as the village head; after he was elected, his work style changed greatly, and he never lost his temper with the masses again. A duty system has been established in the village government. This year, in the summer requisition work, they led the masses to complete the task in two days.

From this election, it can be seen that our past work was not thorough enough. One-third of the incompetent cadres in the village people's government were not educated or removed in time, and some village cadres seriously broke away from the masses or committed illegal and derelict acts. We failed to discover this in advance, which should be deeply reviewed and learned from.

This election gave a very profound education to the new and old village-level cadres. The village cadres clarified that the real "master" is the people, had a deep understanding of the phrase "being a servant of the people," and also reversed the resignation thinking of some village cadres who wanted to "change shoulders" during the village election, because the village cadres fully experienced that losing the election is very shameful, and being re-elected is very glorious. In the past, some village cadres mistakenly believed that "the old ox dies with its strength exhausted, and serving the masses is endless," but after this election education, they knew that the eyes of the masses are truly discerning, and the masses handle right and wrong appropriately, so they felt that they had a real backer. As long as they work honestly, the people will never "repay kindness with enmity."

(3) Before electing the village people's government, we especially emphasized solving the problem of concurrent positions of village cadres. After this group of new backbones and activists emerged, the problem of concurrent positions has been solved in the village government. In the past, there were only 459 village cadres in the 85 village people's governments, but after the election, the number of village cadres increased to 776. Among them, in addition to 321 who were re-elected, 455 were newly elected. The increase in this group of new cadres inevitably shared the various positions of the village government. The village people's government after the election has achieved one person per position. For example, the Shuanghuaishu Village Government originally had four cadres. The original village head, Song Guangjian, concurrently held five important positions as the village party secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the director of the cooperative, the production committee member, and the civil affairs committee member. He was busy every day and his work efficiency was not high. After the village election, five village cadres were added to share the positions of civil affairs, production, etc. Song was demoted to deputy village head because of his bad attitude towards the masses. The work in the village has now improved significantly. For example, the donation work has pledged more than 32 million yuan (equivalent to more than ten kilograms of millet per person); the pre-lending work of more than 46,800 kilograms of wheat has all been stored within three days, completing the task ahead of schedule; the production plan is also well-defined. The area of ​​irrigated land alone has expanded by 437.2 acres. There is no doubt that the village will increase agricultural production by another 10% compared to last year.

Of course, if the problem of concurrent positions of village-level cadres is to be completely resolved, it must be combined with the rectification of various village-level organizations to achieve greater results.

(4) After the establishment of the village people's representative conference and the election of the new village people's government, the relationship between the government and the masses became closer and work efficiency improved. This new village people's government obviously won the support of the masses, so it was able to complete the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, patriotic production increase, digging rivers, eliminating insects, donating, and borrowing wheat more smoothly after March this year.

The members of the village people's government after the election also felt that they were directly elected by the people. If they were not active and responsible and did not do a good job, they would be sorry for the trust and entrustment of their fellow villagers. A sense of responsibility constantly supervised them. For example, Xin Si Village in the 10th district lacked a finance and food committee member. No one had done it for four months. Wang Qingyun was originally found, but he declined because of financial difficulties. However, this time the masses elected him, and he happily took over the matter without saying a word. The relationship between the people's governments of many villages and the masses has indeed changed and improved after the election. For example, after the election in Guanzhuang Village in the 14th district, the corrupt village head Wang Yong and others were replaced. The work in the village has undergone great changes. In the past, the village government was often unmanned, but now there are people, and the masses often go to the village government to chat. In the past two months, they have led the masses to complete many tasks. More than 1,200 workers were mobilized to dig the dam river, and the results were very good. More than 100 free labor days were mobilized to build the school, and the masses had no complaints; 122 households in the village pledged more than 3.7 million yuan; 4,129 kilograms of summer grain were borrowed and completed in one and a half days. Not only was the grain delivered quickly, but it was also of good quality (last year's summer requisition took one and a half months and there was still a tail left).

(5) There were still many errors and shortcomings in the election work of the 85 villages. First of all, the leadership underestimated the progress of the masses, distrusted the masses, and did not dare to let the masses elect freely, resulting in undemocratic, substitute and manipulative phenomena and violations of public opinion in many villages. For example, the Jiujianfang work team in the 14th district insisted that the deputy village head Zheng Sheng and the production committee member Wu Dong be "guaranteed" to be elected, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses. The deputy village head of the Yuchi Administrative Village had already failed to be elected, but the work team used the name of "hiring a deputy village head" to raise him up again. The Shang'an Village in the 16th district was afraid that the cadres considered good by the work team would not be elected, so they increased the number of candidates from 11 to 22, but they were still not elected, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses. Secondly, some district and village cadres did not study the organizational rules and relevant documents of the village election well, and their understanding of consolidating and expanding the rural united front was insufficient, and they did not respect the political rights of the people. In individual places, the right to vote of the families of rich peasants, ordinary Kuomintang members, Sanqing League members, and detainees was deprived, and there were even phenomena of not allowing opium smokers, witches, and dumb people to participate in the election. Of course, this kind of bias was immediately corrected, but the impact was very bad. Another shortcoming is that in the formal election of representatives, many voters participated by sending people according to households. Although the whole family participated in the deliberation and he represented the opinions of the whole family, strictly speaking, this is also inappropriate.

Currently, there are still many problems in the village people's government after the election. The main ones are: 1. The system in the village government is not sound, some systems have not been established, and the division of labor is not clear enough. If this continues, it will inevitably lead to the phenomenon of a few active cadres "dancing naked" and "whipping the fast ox." In addition, the meetings of village cadres and the masses are also held too often, which hinders work and production. Effective measures should be taken to reduce meetings. 2. In order to consolidate the achievements of the village election, more attention should be paid to strengthening the education of village cadres in the future, and strive to conduct general training once a year. New cadres are active and enthusiastic, but lack experience, so more specific assistance is needed. If their difficulties in work are not solved in time, they will not be able to maintain their full working enthusiasm after encountering obstacles. 3. Pay special attention to strengthening the leadership of blank villages, otherwise the work will often develop unevenly, and the blank villages will become more and more backward. In addition, the district should prevent the individual leadership style of the village. Many village cadres failed to be elected this time because they were only familiar with one or two leading cadres, and others could not lead him, which fostered his arrogance and conceit, and as a result, he regarded himself as a red cadre of someone and ignored the relationship with the district government and the contact with the masses.

　　北京市郊区八十五个村的村选工作
    北京市郊区工作委员会
    三月中旬北京市各区开过区人民代表会议后，在中共北京市委与市人民政府领导下，就以贯彻区人民代表会议的决议开展抗美援朝和镇压反革命的群众运动，来推动郊区的农业、副业生产。各村普遍地召开了村人民代表会议或农民代表会议，提高了群众的政治觉悟，掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝、镇压反革命及爱国主义的增产运动，一九五一年增产半成的郊区农业生产计划，有了充分的保证。六月份的第二次区人民代表会议后，在全体代表们的积极努力下，开展了规模很大的爱国增产捐献与小麦预借的群众运动。郊区四十余万农民，从六月十五日到六月三十日为止，半个月中，已认捐三十二亿元。而小麦预借工作，也在空前顺利的情况下结束了，从七月一日到十一日止，已经有六个区全部入库，占百分之九十以上的村庄，估计是可以超过预借任务的。在这几次的群众运动中，许多代表起了很大作用，涌现了大批的积极分子与模范人物，农村中呈现了新的气象。以上情况说明了人民代表会议制度是改进领导，联系群众，完成任务，做好工作的最好的组织形式；一切重大工作通过人民代表会议，也是最科学、最成功的工作方式。
    郊区工作委员会与各区人民政府，为了慎重地、稳步地进行选举村人民政府工作，先有重点地做了典型试验，取得了一定的经验后，在郊区八十五个行政村中（共有二百五十六个村、十个镇、十五个街人民政府）召开了村人民代表大会，选举了村人民政府，选出了人民所拥护的爱戴的正副村长与村人民政府委员。其具体经验：
    （一）选举中我们发扬了民主，放手大胆地发动了群众，听取群众自己的意见，选举了一九六位正副村长、五八○位村人民政府委员，组织了新的村人民政府。这些村长与委员的产生，都是经过了人民代表与人民群众很长时间的（六、七天）充分酝酿与反复讨论，评比筛选，由代表提出候选名单后，用举手表决方式选出的。
    从七七六个村干部的成份上看，中农占百分之三十五（原来百分之二十九）；贫农占百分之五十六（原来百分之六十二）；雇农占百分之五（原来百分之六）；冬学教员及小手工业者占百分之四（原来百分之三）。从性别上看，妇女占百分之九（原来百分之一）。比原来村人民政府的代表性是更加广泛了，使农村统一战线的基础更加巩固与扩大了。
    经验证明，放手地让群众自己选择，按着群众的意思提出候选名单，然后，工作组再加以研究指导，除个别候选人可能有重大政治问题外，应该坚决地给群众撑腰，这是正确的民主做法，这是符合“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线的。相反的十三区一亩园村选举筹委会，先提出了一个七人候选名单，向群众宣布后，舆论大哗，群众说“你们决定，我们就用不着选了！”工作组看见事情不好，当即宣布无效，但放手让群众选举后，结果与名单上一样，只换了一个更为合适的委员。
    候选人提几个就选几个与举手表决方式，这二种简单准确容易办到的选举方法，是最受农民群众欢迎的，农民说：“这样选正对咱的劲”，因为候选人经过了充分酝酿，群众考虑成熟、意见集中之后，这种选举方法最便于保证群众的意见。个别地方不这样做就失败了。
    （二）群众的眼睛是雪亮的，对村干部的鉴定是正确的，群众的赏罚也是严明的。根据八十五个村的统计，选举前共有村干部（正副村长、民政、财粮、文教、生产、治安等委员）四五九人，这次落选的有一三八人（内村长二十一，副村长二十三），其中违法失职者有十九人，作风不好的有三十二人，工作不负责任的有五十三人，有政治问题的九人，因能力差及家庭困难而自行辞职的有十四人，其他年纪太老、太小、神经病或迁移者有十一人。同时还有三百二十一个村干部，因为积极能干，工作作风好，在群众中有威望，连选连任（计村长四十八人，副村长四十六人）；另外还有十三位村长因为能力差，工作消极，作风不太好而降了级，有九个副村长十七个村政府委员升了级。以上数字说明了群众对于为他们服务的村干部，绝不是一味的打击，而是采取肯定成绩，批评缺点，纠正错误，处分罪过，治病救人的干部政策。群众在选举会议上，用具体事实，教育村干部改正错误的生动例子是非常多的。如西黄村村长李永江，过去工作还积极负责，但方式简单，爱耍态度，因而与群众关系不好。这次代表们在会议上给他提出意见，他自己也做了深刻的检讨。群众见他肯接受批评，仍又选他当了村长；他当选后，作风有很大的转变，再没有向群众发过脾气。村政府里建立了值班制度，今年夏征工作，他们在二天内，就领导群众完成了任务。
    从这次的选举中可以看出我们过去的工作是不够深入的，在村人民政府内有三分之一的不称职干部，未能及时地教育或清除，有些村干部严重地脱离群众，或者作了违法失职的事情。我们未能事前发觉，这是应该深刻检讨与引为教训的。
    这次选举给了新旧的村级干部一个非常深刻的教育。村干部明确了真正的“东家”是人民，对“当人民勤务员”这句话有了深刻的理解，并且也扭转了一部分村干部想趁村选而“大换肩”的退职思想，因为村干部充分地体验到：落选是很丢人的，连选连任是很光荣的。过去有些村干部，错误地认为“老牛力尽刀尖死，侍奉群众不到头”，但经过这次的选举教育，知道了群众的眼睛真是雪亮的，群众对于是非轻重，处理得十分恰当，因此觉得自己有了真正的靠山，只要老老实实地工作，老百姓绝不会“恩当仇报”。
    （三）选举村人民政府之前，我们就特别强调解决村干部的兼职问题。在涌现了这批新的骨干与积极分子后，兼职问题在村政府内已获得了解决。过去在八十五个村人民政府中，只有四百五十九位村干部，而选举后村干部则增到七百七十六人，其中除三百二十一位是连选连任外，有四百五十五位是新当选的。这批新干部的增加，必然地分担了村政府的各种职务。选举后的村人民政府中已经作到了一人一职，例如双槐树村政府原有干部四人，原任村长宋光俭，兼中共村支书、合作社主任、生产委员、民政委员五个重要职务，每天忙乱不堪，工作效率不大。村选后，增加村干部五人，分担民政、生产等职务，宋因对群众态度不好，降为副村长；该村工作，现已很见起色，如捐献工作已认捐三千二百余万元（合每人平均十斤多小米）；四万六千八百多斤的小麦预借工作在三天内已全部入库，提前完成了任务；生产计划订的也很好，只扩大水地面积就有四三七·二亩，全村在农业生产上比去年再增产一成是毫无问题的。
    当然，如果彻底地解决村级干部的兼职问题，还必须结合整顿村级各种组织工作同时进行，才能够收到更大的效果。
    （四）建立了村人民代表会议与选出了新的村人民政府后，政府与群众的关系更加密切了，工作效率提高了。这个新的村人民政府，很显然地获得了群众的拥护，因而能够较顺利地完成了今年三月以后的抗美援朝、镇压反革命、爱国增产、挖河、除虫、捐献、借麦等工作。
    经过选举后的村人民政府委员们，也觉得自己是人民直接选举出来的，如果不积极负责，搞好工作，对不起父老兄妹对自己的信任与委托。责任感经常督责着他们。如第十区辛四村缺一个财粮委员，四个月都没人干，原先找到王庆云，他因为生活困难推辞了，可是这次群众选上他，他一句话也没说就高兴地接了事。许多村的人民政府经选举后确实改变了与改善着与群众的关系。比如十四区关庄村人民政府，经选举换掉了贪污村长王永等四人后，该村的工作有了很大的转变，从前村政府常没人办公，现在有人了，群众也常到村政府去聊天。两个多月来领导群众完成了很多任务，挖坝河动员了一千二百多个工，成绩很好。发动群众义务劳动一百多个工，修建了学校，而群众毫没怨言；该村一百二十二户认捐了三百七十多万元；夏借公粮四千一百二十九斤，用了一天半时间就完成了任务，不但交的快，而且粮食好（去年夏征用了一个半月时间还剩下了一个尾巴）。
    （五）八十五个村的选举工作，错误与缺点还是很多的。首先是领导上对群众的进步估计不足，不信任群众，不敢放手大胆地让群众选举，致使许多村发生了不民主、代替包办与违反民意的现象。如十四区九间房工作组硬叫“保证”副村长郑升与生产委员吴栋当选，招致群众不满。鱼池行政村副村长已经落选了，工作组用“聘请副村长”名义又给抬上去。十六区上岸村怕选不上工作组认为好的干部，把十一个候选人增加成二十二个，结果还是没有选上，引起群众的不满。其次是部分区村干部没有很好地学习村选的组织通则及有关文件，对巩固与扩大农村统一战线认识不足，对人民的政治权利尊重不够。个别地方剥夺了富农、一般国民党员、三青团员、管押分子的家属的选举权，甚至还有不让吸大烟的、巫婆、哑叭等人参加选举的现象。当然这种偏向都被立时纠正，但影响很不好。再一个缺点是在正式选举代表时，许多选民都是按户派人参加的，虽然全家都参加了酝酿，他是代表了全家人的意见，但严格的讲，这样也是不妥当的。
    目前在选举后的村人民政府中还存在着许多问题，其中主要的：一、村政府里制度还不健全，有些制度还没有建立，分工亦不够明确。长此下去，必然产生少数积极干部“裸体跳舞”与“鞭打快牛”现象。此外村干部与群众的会也开得太多，妨碍了工作，也妨碍了生产，应采取有效办法减少会议。二、为了巩固村选的成绩，今后要多注意加强村干部教育，一年争取普遍训练一次。新干部积极、热情，但缺乏经验，须多作些具体帮助。如果不及时地给他们解决工作中的困难，碰到钉子后，将不能保持饱满的工作情绪。三、特别注意加强空白村的领导，不然工作常是不平衡地发展下去，空白村就越发落后了。另外区对村应防止个人领导的方式，这次许多村干部落选是因为只跟一、二个领导干部熟，别人不能领导他，助长了他骄傲自大、目空一切的情绪，结果自认是某某人的红干部，而忽视了同区政府的关系及与群众的联系。
