　　Correcting an Error in the Article "Correctly Propagandize Party History"
    Editor
    The criticism in the article "Correctly Propagandize Party History," published in the Cultural Life column on July 18th, which criticized the special article "Celebrating the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China" published by the "Wanbei Dazhong Bao" on July 1st, was inappropriate and should be retracted.
    The passage in the "Wanbei Dazhong Bao" article describing the Party's revolutionary war history was quoted from the article "What Has the Communist Party of China Done for the Chinese People in the Past Thirty Years?" in the 17th issue of the Current Affairs Handbook, and the Current Affairs Handbook was quoted from the Xinhua News Agency editorial "Sixth Commentary on the White Paper" on September 16, 1949. The "Wanbei Dazhong Bao" quoted these words to briefly explain several victories of the Chinese People's Revolutionary War in the past thirty years, and there was no discrepancy from the original meaning of the "Sixth Commentary on the White Paper." We mistakenly thought that the "Wanbei Dazhong Bao" was attempting to summarize the entire revolutionary war history of the past thirty years, and therefore made an inappropriate criticism, which was our oversight. We hereby declare the retraction of this criticism and hope that the comrades and readers of the "Wanbei Dazhong Bao" will take note.

　　纠正《正确地宣传党的历史》一文的一个错误
    编者
    发表在七月十八日文化生活栏中的《正确地宣传党的历史》一文中，曾批评了七月一日《皖北大众报》发表的专论“庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年”这个批评是不恰当的，应当撤消。
    《皖北大众报》那篇文章中叙述党的革命战争史的一段话，是从时事手册第十七期《三十年来中国共产党为中国人民做了些什么？》一文引来的，而时事手册又是从一九四九年九月十六日新华社社论《六评白皮书》引来的。《皖北大众报》引用这些话是为了简括地说明中国人民革命战争在这三十年中的几项胜利，和《六评白皮书》中的原意并没有什么出入。我们错误地以为“皖北大众报”在这里是企图总结三十年来的全部革命战争史，因而作了不恰当的批评，这是我们的疏忽。我们特在此声明撤消这个批评，希望《皖北大众报》的同志们和读者同志们注意。
