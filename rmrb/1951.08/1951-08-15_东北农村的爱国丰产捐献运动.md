　　The vast rural areas of Northeast China are vigorously launching a patriotic production increase and donation movement. According to incomplete statistics from 78 counties in Heilongjiang Province, such as Keshan; Songjiang Province, such as Shuangcheng and Hulan; Jilin Province, such as Yushu and Jiaohe; Liaoxi Province, such as Zhangwu and Kangping; Liaodong Province, such as Kuandian and Fengcheng; and Rehe Province, such as Luanping and Qinglong, 950 labor model mutual aid teams took the lead in initiating this movement and competed with each other, driving the broad masses of farmers to enthusiastically participate in it. In 27 counties of Heilongjiang Province alone, 22,986 mutual aid teams have formulated summer hoeing plans and participated in the production increase and donation movement. Among them, five banners and counties, including Guoqian Banner, have combined the donation movement with the formulation, inspection, and revision of patriotic pacts in 5,028 mutual aid teams. In Panshi County, Jilin Province, most of the 2,699 teams participating in the production increase competition responded to the donation movement by formulating patriotic pacts. In Minli Village, Keshan County, all 208 households have formulated patriotic pacts. At the beginning of summer hoeing, the labor model Yang Xianting mutual aid team took the lead in formulating a production increase and donation plan, proposing a challenge competition. The masses unanimously responded to the challenge, with 80% of the teams and households pledging to donate one-third of their increased income to buy airplanes and cannons. In many villages such as Baoshan Village in Bayan County, Xin'an Village in Liuhe County, and Mengzhang Village in Chaoyang County, 60% to 80% of the teams and households participated in the production increase and donation movement. In the donation movement, many women also put forward the slogan of competition: "Participate in production, guarantee a bumper harvest, donate weapons, and defend our country."

　　The enthusiastic development of this production increase and donation movement is inseparable from the patriotic education of the past six months and the improvement of the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. The village head of Qianxintun Village in Kangping County said: "Now that we have been emancipated and become masters, we have been allocated land and our lives are prosperous. If it were not for the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's army defeating the American aggressors in Korea, we would not be able to live a good life." Wang Yongsheng, the militia captain of Jiayou Village in Xifeng County, said: "When the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea began last year, I asked to go to Korea, but I couldn't achieve my goal, which really made me feel frustrated. Now that I have the patriotic opportunity to donate airplanes and cannons, of course, I will put in more effort."

　　In order to realize the patriotic production increase and donation plan, many farmers are striving to improve farming techniques. For example, farmers in Qijiazi Village, Kangping County, proposed: "During summer hoeing, hoe the cotton more often, top the plants more often, and strive for each plant to produce one more boll or at least two plants to produce one more boll; hoe the large fields more often, select seed-retaining land, and apply top dressing to ensure that even if there is a spring drought, we can still complete the plan of producing one more stone of grain per hectare." Originally, half of the households did not plan to use pesticides, but they also bought sprayers and pesticides, preparing to prevent insects and control aphids. Some are seizing the time to apply top dressing, some are preparing for catching insects and spraying medicine, and some are organizing women to go to the fields more often to help men engage in sideline occupations. The high patriotic donation enthusiasm is encouraging farmers to push the bumper harvest movement forward.

　　However, the development of the patriotic production increase and donation movement in Northeast China is currently uneven, and there are still several problems in the movement that urgently need to be solved.

　　First, some areas have a tendency to neglect politics in the production movement, which hinders the development of the donation movement. For example, the village head of Xingnong Village in Guxiang District, a suburb of Harbin, said after receiving the notice to formulate a patriotic pact and launch a donation movement: "Summer hoeing is already too busy, how can we have time to formulate a donation plan? What kind of pact! Let's talk about it in the fall." Many rural cadres used to one-sidedly emphasize "getting rich through production" in their production propaganda. Now, they have even developed to the point where "they dare not combine production increase with patriotic donation," because they are afraid that calling for donations "will increase the concerns of the masses." For example, the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch in Changchan Village, Shuangcheng, said: "As soon as we mention donations, the villagers are uneasy about production. It's not too late to donate after the bumper harvest movement is over." They juxtapose the bumper harvest and patriotic donation, and do not patiently and correctly educate the farmers, which hinders the development of the donation movement.

　　Second, many areas simply call for increased production without inspiring farmers to think of more ways to improve farming techniques. For example, some farmers in Ertaizi Village, Faku County, although they have formulated a production increase plan, still hold the idea that "planning is up to people, and harvesting grain is up to heaven," and have not actively thought of ways to improve farming techniques to ensure the realization of the production increase plan. Some farmers and cadres neglect to promote the existing experience of farmers in many ways, limiting the improvement of technology to the use of new farm implements and chemical pesticides. Some cadres in Yixian County said: "There are no new farm implements in this area, what other technology is there?" In this way, the improvement of technology and the guarantee of a bumper harvest are hindered.

　　Third, the production increase and donation movement in some areas is still limited to the scope of "points" and has not yet formed a mass movement. The reason is that the leading organs only focus on the "points" with a better foundation, while relaxing or abandoning leadership over villages with a weaker foundation. According to a survey in three types of villages in Muling County: Fumin Village is a key village, with 21 teams competing with each other; Minzhu Village is a general village, with only two teams competing, forming the phenomenon of "a few people working, most people watching"; Jixiang Village has a poor working foundation, and the movement has not been launched at all. In Xi'an County, because the leading organs overemphasized "preventing formalism," they did not dare to boldly promote the experience of key villages, and the production increase competition movement was only active within the scope of "points." Some districts and villages in Jilin only mobilized labor models to compete, so the masses said: "Where there are labor models, there is a movement." This has created an extremely unbalanced state in the development of the patriotic production increase and donation movement in various places.

　　Fourth, some areas have experienced the phenomenon of coercion and command, which has lost the political significance of the donation movement. For example, the cadres of Fuli Village, Hulan County, said to the masses: "Donation is voluntary, but only those who donate more than 50 jin per hectare can be 'voluntary,' and those who donate less than 50 jin are not allowed to be 'voluntary.'" Some villages allocate the number of donations according to the grade of the land. In Aihe Village, Jiaohe County, the most difficult teams and households were first "mobilized" to propose the number of donations as an example, so that the masses could "take it as a comparison," which the masses called "hard squeezing." In some areas, because the propaganda and education work was not done enough, some farmers became concerned. They said: "What if we promise to donate so much now, but we don't get a harvest in the fall? Let's just listen to the news first and talk about it in the fall." This wait-and-see mentality also hinders the in-depth development of the movement.

　　东北农村的爱国丰产捐献运动
    张庆泰
    东北区的广大农村，正蓬勃地开展爱国丰产捐献运动。据黑龙江省的克山，松江省的双城、呼兰、吉林省的榆树、蛟河，辽西省的彰武、康平，辽东省的宽甸、凤城，热河省的滦平、青龙等七十八个县不完全的统计，有九百五十个劳动模范互助组带头发起这一运动，并互相竞赛，带动广大农民热烈地投入了这一运动。在黑龙江省的二十七个县中，即有二万二千九百八十六个互助组订立了夏锄计划，参加了增产捐献运动；其中郭前旗等五个旗、县，并有五千零二十八个互助组结合捐献运动，订立或检查、修订了爱国公约。吉林省磐石县参加丰产竞赛的二千六百九十九个组，大部分通过订立爱国公约，响应了捐献运动。克山县的民立村，全村二百零八户都订立了爱国公约；进入夏锄时，劳动模范杨显亭互助组首先订出了增产捐献计划，提出挑战竞赛，群众一致应战，百分之八十的组、户平均以增产收入的三分之一捐献买飞机大炮。巴彦县宝山村，柳河县新安村、朝阳县孟章村等许多村屯，都有百分之六十至八十的组、户参加增产捐献运动。在捐献运动中，许多妇女也提出了竞赛口号：“参加生产，保证丰收，捐献武器，保家卫国。”
    这次丰产捐献运动的热烈开展，是和半年多来的爱国主义教育，广大农民的政治觉悟和生产情绪的提高分不开的。康平县前辛屯村长说：“现在翻身作了主，分得土地，生活富裕啦。要不是共产党领导，人民队伍在朝鲜打败美国侵略军，那能过好日子。”西丰县嘉猷屯民兵队长王永生说：“去年抗美援朝一开始，我要求到朝鲜去，未能达到目的，真把我蹩气了；这回有了捐献飞机大炮的爱国机会，当然要多出一把力。”
    许多农民为了实现爱国丰产捐献计划，正努力改进耕作技术。如康平县七家子村的农民提出：“夏锄中棉花多铲趟一遍，多打一遍尖杈，争取每棵多开一个桃至少两棵多开一个桃；大田多铲趟一遍，选出留种地，上追肥，保证虽受春旱，仍可完成每垧多打一石粮的计划”；原先有半数不打算用农药的户，也买了喷雾器和农药，准备防虫治蚜。有的抓紧上追肥，有的作好捕虫、打药水，有的组织妇女多下地替出男子搞副业。高昂的爱国捐献热情，正在鼓舞着农民把丰产运动推向前进。
    但目前东北区爱国丰产捐献运动的发展是不平衡的，运动中还存在着以下几个问题，亟待解决。
    第一，某些地区在生产运动中存在着忽视政治的倾向，妨碍了捐献运动的开展。如哈尔滨市郊顾乡区兴农村村长，接到订立爱国公约展开捐献运动的通知后说：“夏锄还忙不过来，那有工夫订捐献计划？搞什么公约！等秋后再说吧。”不少农村干部在过去生产宣传中片面地强调“生产发家”，现在竟发展到“搞丰产不敢结合爱国捐献”，因为怕号召捐献“会增加群众顾虑”。如双城长产村中共支部书记说：“一提捐献，老乡生产就不安心，等丰产运动完了再捐也不晚。”他们把丰产与爱国捐献对立起来，而不耐心地、正确地去教育农民，这就阻碍了捐献运动的开展。
    第二，不少地区单纯地号召增产，而没有启发农民多想办法提高耕作技术。如法库县二台子村有的农民虽然订出了增产计划，但还抱着“计划在人，打粮在天”的思想，没有积极想办法来改进耕作技术，以保证增产计划的实现。有的农民与干部忽视从多方面推广农民中已有的经验，把改进技术限于使用新式农具和化学农药。义县有的干部说：“这地区没新农具，还有啥技术？”这样，就使提高技术，保证丰产受了阻碍。
    第三，有些地区的丰产捐献运动仍停留在“点”的范围内，尚未形成群众性的运动。原因是领导机关只搞基础较好的“点”，而对基础较差的村屯就放松或放弃了领导。据穆棱县在三种类型的村庄调查：福民村是重点村，有二十一个组互相竞赛；民主村是个一般村，只有两个组竞赛，形成“少数人干，多数人看”的现象；吉祥村工作基础较差，运动根本就没有搞起来。西安县因为领导机关过分强调“防止流于形式”，未敢放手推广重点村的经验，丰产竞赛运动就只在“点”的范围内活跃。吉林有的区村只发动劳动模范竞赛，所以群众说：“那里有劳模，那里就有运动。”这就形成各地爱国丰产捐献运动开展极不平衡的状态。
    第四，有的地区发生了强迫命令现象，失去了捐献运动的政治意义。如呼兰县福利村干部对群众说：“捐献是自愿的，但每垧地捐献五十斤以上，才可以‘自愿’，五十斤以下的不许‘自愿’。”有的村是按土地等级摊派捐献数目的。蛟河县爱河村，先“发动”最困难的组、户提出捐献数目作样子，让群众“比着拿”，群众称之为“硬挤油”。有的地区因为宣传教育工作做得不够，部分农民发生顾虑。他们说：“现在答应捐多少，秋天收不到怎么办？干脆先听听信，到秋后再说。”这种观望等待的思想，也阻碍了运动的深入开展。
