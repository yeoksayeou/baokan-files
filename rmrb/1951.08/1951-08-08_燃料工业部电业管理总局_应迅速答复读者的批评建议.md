   To the Editor:
    I am very happy to read the "Letters from Readers" section of the People's Daily, because the criticisms and suggestions from the activists among the people published in the "Letters from Readers" section, directed at various aspects, and the responses from those concerned to these criticisms and suggestions, vividly demonstrate the people's fervent concern for the construction of our great motherland, as well as the democratic style of the relevant authorities in closely contacting the masses and improving their work by using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. Therefore, from the garden of "Letters from Readers," we can not only see the improvement of the people's political consciousness and the progress of national democratization, but also learn from it the democratic style and the experience of carrying out criticism and self-criticism.
    However, the "Letters from Readers" section of the People's Daily also has such a shortcoming: that is, the replies of individual government departments to criticisms and suggestions are not timely enough. For example, on January 23 this year, the "Letters from Readers" section of the People's Daily published Comrade Liu Yushan's letter to the Bureau of Electricity Management of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, raising the issue of "Improving the leadership of the Shijingshan Power Plant," and until now, we have not seen the reply from the Bureau of Electricity Management. Here we do not know whether the Bureau of Electricity Management has not replied, or whether the editors of the People's Daily have shelved other people's replies. We hope that the Bureau of Electricity Management and the editors of the People's Daily will both conduct a check, and hope to see these two replies as soon as possible.

    Editor's Note: On January 23 this year, the "Letters from Readers" section of this newspaper published a letter from Liu Yushan, criticizing the Bureau of Electricity Management of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, requesting them to improve the leadership of the Shijingshan Power Plant. We wrote to the Bureau of Electricity Management on January 31, asking them to reply. In mid-February, they replied, saying that they were currently conducting an inspection, but were not prepared to make a public reply. We disagreed and called them again to urge them to reply, and sent three consecutive letters on March 12, March 23, and April 12, but until now they have not sent the reply.
    The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on展开批评和自我批评in Newspapers and Periodicals" of April 19, 1950, stated: "After criticism is published in newspapers and periodicals, if it is completely true, the criticized party should immediately declare its acceptance and announce the results of correcting the errors in the same newspaper or periodical. If there are some inaccuracies, the criticized party should immediately make a realistic correction in the same newspaper or periodical and accept the correct part of the criticism." We hope that the Bureau of Electricity Management of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government can, in this spirit, make a realistic reply to the criticisms of the masses.

### 燃料工业部电业管理总局  应迅速答复读者的批评建议

   燃料工业部电业管理总局
   应迅速答复读者的批评建议编辑同志：
    我很欢喜阅读人民日报的读者来信，因为读者来信所登载的人民群众中的积极分子对各方面的批评建议和有关者对这些批评建议的答复，都生动地表现了人民群众对我们伟大祖国各种建设事业的热切关怀，以及有关机关运用批评与自我批评的武器密切联系群众改进工作的民主作风。因此，从读者来信这块园地里，不仅可以看到人民群众政治觉悟的提高和国家民主化的进程，而且从这里也可以使我学习到民主作风和进行批评与自我批评的经验。
    但是，人民日报的读者来信栏也还有着这样一个缺点：就是个别的政府机关部门对待批评建议的答复很不及时。例如：今年一月二十三日人民日报读者来信栏发表了刘玉山同志对中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局提出“应改善对石景山发电厂的领导”问题的来信，直到现在，我们还没有看到电业管理总局的答复。这里我们不知道是电业管理总局没有答复呢，还是人民日报编辑同志把别人的答复搁置起来了。我们希望电业管理总局和人民日报编辑同志都作一番检查，并且希望尽快地看到这两个答复。
                                        孙嘉恒
    编者按：本年一月二十三日，本报读者来信栏发表了刘玉山的来信，对中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局有所批评，要求他们改善对石景山发电厂的领导。我们曾于一月三十一日，写信给电业管理总局，请他们答复。二月中，他们复信说，现在正在检查，但不准备作公开答复。我们不同意，又去电话催他们答复，并于三月十二日、三月二十三日、四月十二日连续去信催了三次，但是直到现在他们还没有把答复寄来。
    一九五○年四月十九日“中国共产党中央委员会关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”中说：“批评在报纸刊物上发表后，如完全属实，被批评者应即在同一报纸刊物上声明接受并公布改正错误的结果。如有部分失实，被批评者应即在同一报纸刊物上作出实事求是的更正，而接受批评的正确部分。”我们希望中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局，能够本着这样一种精神，对于群众的批评，作出实事求是的答复。
