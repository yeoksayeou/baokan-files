　　Japanese Workers' Movement Demanding Overall Peace Treaty Runs High
	"Sohyo" Issues Declaration Willing to Participate in Peace Movement and Oppose Rearmament
	Overall Peace Treaty Council and "Sanbetsu" Issue Statements Expressing Welcome
(Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th) Under the influence of Japanese workers' widespread demands for the conclusion of an overall peace treaty, the fourth council meeting of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (abbreviated as "Sohyo") issued a declaration on July 4th, stating that "Sohyo" is willing to "actively fight for peace, join hands with the Socialist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, the Religious Peace Movement Council, and other groups to demand an overall peace treaty and oppose rearmament."

　　The Overall Peace Treaty Patriotic Movement Council and the Executive Committee of the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Organizations (abbreviated as "Sanbetsu") issued statements on July 10th and 26th respectively, welcoming the "Sohyo" declaration and hoping to truly unite and fight together for peace.

　　The Overall Peace Treaty Patriotic Movement Council also issued the following appeals to the Japanese people: (1) Massively collect signatures demanding an overall peace treaty and opposing the arming of Japan to show the determination of the Japanese people; (2) Immediately restore trade with China, and transform all industries for the people into peaceful industries; (3) Regardless of differences in party, religion, or ideology, under the leadership of the working class, firmly unite all peace-loving patriots.

　　The "Sanbetsu" Executive Committee's statement said: We express our heartfelt agreement with "Sohyo's" initiation of a national movement with peace and independence as its goals. Since January of this year, we have also established the Overall Peace Treaty Patriotic Movement Council under the banner of demanding an overall peace treaty and opposing rearmament, launching a nationwide signature campaign, and the number of signatures has now exceeded three million. Members and cadres of local trade unions under the "Sohyo" system have also actively participated in this movement.

　　The statement pointed out: Attempts to divide lines in the peace movement not only violate the hopes of the grassroots masses of "Sohyo," but also hinder all Japanese people who hope for peace and independence from uniting as one. There are not two kinds of peace; the only distinction is between war and peace.

　　The statement continued: We must consolidate the unity of all those who oppose war and demand an overall peace treaty in various workplaces and regions, and we must fight against the reactionary pawns who attempt to forcibly conclude a one-sided peace treaty, and constantly strive to break this "line."

　　The statement finally hoped that "Sohyo" would participate in the Japan National Peace Congress to be held on August 15th.

　　日本工人要求全面缔和运动高涨
   “总评”发表宣言愿意参加和平运动反对重新武装
    全面媾和协议会与“产别”发表声明表示欢迎
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：在日本工人纷纷要求缔结全面和约的影响下，日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）第四届理事会，曾于七月四日发表宣言，声称“总评”愿意“积极为和平斗争，与社会党、劳农党、宗教家和平运动协议会及其他团体携手，起来要求全面媾和，反对重新武装”。
    全面媾和爱国运动协议会和全日本产业别工会会议（简称“产别”）执行委员会先后在七月十日和二十六日发表声明，对“总评”的宣言表示欢迎，并希望能真正团结一致，共同为和平而斗争。
    全面媾和爱国运动协议会并向日本人民发出下列号召：（一）大量征集要求全面媾和、反对武装日本的签名，以表示日本人民的决心；（二）立即恢复与中国的贸易，一切工业为了人民，转变为和平工业；（三）不问党派、宗教或思想的不同，在工人阶级领导下，巩固地团结一切爱好和平的爱国人士。
    “产别”执行委员会的声明说：“总评”以和平与独立为目标发起国民运动，我们表示衷心的同意。我们自今年一月以来，就同样在要求全面媾和、反对重新武装的旗帜下，成立了全面媾和爱国运动协议会，展开全国性的签名运动，现在签名人数已经超过了三百万。“总评”系统下的各地工会会员与干部，也都积极参加了这个运动。
    声明指出：想在和平运动中划分界线的企图，不但违反“总评”的基层群众的希望，并且妨碍一切希望和平与独立的日本人民团结成一体。和平并没有两种，有分别的只是战争与和平。
    声明接着说：我们要在各种工作岗位和各个地区巩固团结一切反对战争、要求全面媾和的人们，要和企图强行片面媾和的反动派爪牙作斗争，要不断努力打破这个“界线”。
    声明最后希望“总评”参加将于八月十五日举行的日本全国和平大会。
