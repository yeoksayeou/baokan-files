    Reader's Letters
　　"A Record of the Investigation of Wu Xun's History" Criticized My "Above Class" Thinking
    Comrade Editor:
    Around 1944, Xi'an City held a fairly large-scale "Wu Xun Picture Exhibition." I was very moved after seeing it and thought Wu Xun was a truly remarkable person. He would rather "endure all hardship" for his whole life in order to run "free schools" for "poor children." After that, whenever I talked about Wu Xun with people, I always praised and lauded him unconditionally.
    When the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" was first released, I watched it once with friends. Apart from feeling that some parts, such as the long segment where Wu Xun dreamed, were really unnecessary, I thought the movie was not bad. It wasn't until the articles criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun" were published one after another this May that I began to realize that there were problems with my understanding of Wu Xun, but I did not completely negate Wu Xun because of this.
    After the "Record of the Investigation of Wu Xun's History" was published recently, I read it in detail several times. This article greatly improved my understanding, and it thoroughly corrected my past erroneous understanding of Wu Xun.
    Not only that, I feel that the "Record of the Investigation of Wu Xun's History" also provides us with new and scientific methods for studying problems. Chairman Mao taught us: Without investigation, there is no right to speak. The reason why I mistakenly worshipped Wu Xun, on the one hand, was certainly because I neither investigated nor analyzed and criticized, but blindly and irresponsibly echoed what others said, resulting in harming myself and others, and deceiving myself and others. But why was I so easily influenced by the ideas of Wu Xun's eulogizers? The main reason is that I came from a petty-bourgeois background, was dissatisfied with reality, and had illusions about reality. I could not recognize the direction of historical development, and mistakenly believed that individual efforts are beneficial to the people anyway; but in fact, it is not the people who benefit, but the people's mortal enemies – the reactionaries. Because I analyzed problems from an above-class viewpoint, I worked as a clerk for the reactionaries for several years without feeling that I was serving the reactionaries at all. Today, to say this to the people, this is a sin! After reading the "Record of the Investigation of Wu Xun's History," on the one hand, I began to understand how to criticize historical figures, and on the other hand, I criticized myself, and I was more determined to serve the people.

　　Taiyuan Private Jin Cheng Construction Factory
    Subcontracts Projects to Carry Out Intermediate Exploitation
    Causing Serious Losses to Workers and the Project
    Comrade Editor:
    The Taiyuan City private Jin Cheng Construction Factory, disguisedly subcontracts projects, conducts feudal intermediate exploitation, and does not follow design drawings during construction, causing great danger to some projects.
    Jin Cheng Construction Factory contracted nine shop and building projects for Fuju Chehang, Hua Fengshanghang, etc. The construction factory illegally extracted 20% from the total contract price, and then subcontracted the projects to contractors Yao Yinhuai, Zheng Haiqing, Xu Dawen, and Lü Renyong under the names of "collective piecework," "labor partnership," and "scoring system." Because of this layer-by-layer subcontracting, more than 40 workers did not receive the minimum standard wages of Taiyuan City. When contractor Yao Yinhuai privately subcontracted the Deshengcheng shop project from Jin Cheng Construction Factory, because the Municipal Construction Bureau did not allow unregistered construction factories to privately contract projects, Yao Yinhuai gave Jin Cheng Construction Factory 20% of the contract price and bought the Jin Cheng Construction Factory's seal.
    During the construction, Jin Cheng Construction Factory, as long as it subcontracted the project, would no longer supervise and manage it, and would allow the foremen who did not understand engineering design to carry out the construction, or blindly let the owners change the construction methods. When a building project on Hongshi Street was under construction, the lower floor of the building was lengthened by two meters without the consent of the architect, and the positions of two walls on the upper floor were moved in order to use old materials. As a result, these two walls were not built straight up, but were newly built from the floor. The beams and columns of the lower floor could not bear such weight, and the whole building was in danger.
    The above situation was reported by workers successively, or discovered by the Construction Bureau's inspection. Now, on the one hand, the illegally deducted wages are being recovered to supplement the workers, and on the other hand, Jin Cheng Construction Factory is being ordered to rebuild those buildings that are in great danger.

　　Wuxi Town Tax Bureau of Luxi County Should Not Reduce Tax Rates Without Authorization
    Comrade Editor:
    The Wuxi Town Tax Office, which belongs to Luxi County in Hunan, has not been collecting business tax according to the prescribed tax rate for a long time. For example, the business tax on tung oil should be 3% according to regulations, but the office is afraid of the trouble of calculation, just for the sake of simplicity, and only charges 2% like edible oil. At the beginning of April this year, the state-owned Luxi County Trading Company discovered this situation and raised it to the responsible comrade of the office, but it was not taken seriously, and they said instead: "Tung oil is not the main business." And on May 2nd of this year, they sent a note to Luxi Trading Company saying: "There is no tung oil specialty in our town. The small number of tung oil businesses are combined with the main oil and salt business (referring to edible oil) and taxed at 2% business tax." However, apart from those who also deal in tung oil, there are actually four merchants specializing in tung oil in the town, namely Tongyi, Fucheng, and Zheng Lichang (there were six last year). Also, in terms of the entire market of Wuxi Town, tung oil funds account for 70% of the total market funds. Since its establishment in April last year, the tax office has undercollected 1% of the business tax on tung oil for more than a year, and the accumulated figure is quite large. Taking the more than 150,000 catties of tung oil shipped out by Luxi Trading Company from January to May this year as an example, calculated at a price of 400,000 yuan per dan, the undercollected business tax is 6 million yuan. And the tung oil purchased by Luxi Trading Company only accounts for one-third of the tung oil transaction volume in the market. The office has arbitrarily revised the state's tax laws, causing great losses to the state's financial revenue. This practice is absolutely not allowed, and I hope they will review and correct it.

　　“武训历史调查记”批判了我的“超阶级”思想编辑同志：
    大约在一九四四年，西安市曾经举办了一次规模相当大的“武训画传展览会”，我看后非常感动，觉得武训真是了不起的人物，他宁可自己终生“受尽辛苦”，也要为了“穷孩子”办“义学”。此后只要和人谈起武训，我总是无条件地称赞他，歌颂他。
    电影《武训传》刚放映时，我就和朋友看了一次，除了感到有些地方，如武训作梦的那一长段，实在不必要之外，觉得这部电影还是不坏。直到今年五月批评《武训传》的文章，接连发表后，我才开始认识到自己对武训的认识有问题了，但并没有因此彻底否定武训。
    最近“武训历史调查记”发表以后，我详细读了好几遍，这篇文章，可把我的认识提高不少，它彻底纠正了我过去对武训错误的认识。
    不仅如此，我感到“武训历史调查记”还给我们提供了新的、科学的研究问题的方法。毛主席教导我们：没有调查研究，便没有发言权。而我之所以错误地崇拜武训，一方面固然也是由于自己既不调查研究，也不分析批判，只盲目地不负责任地人云亦云，结果是害人害己，自欺欺人。但我为什么那样容易接受武训歌颂者的思想影响呢？主要的还是由于自己出身于小资产阶级，对现实不满，而又对现实存在着幻想，认不清历史发展的方向，错误地认为：个人的努力，反正也是于人民有利；但是实际上，有利的并不是人民，而是人民的死对头——反动派。由于自己是以超阶级的观点来分析问题的，因而给反动派当了几年职员，而丝毫不感到自己是为反动派服务。今天对人民说，这就是罪恶！读了“武训历史调查记”，一方面使我初步懂得了如何批判历史人物，另一方面也批判了自己，更坚定了为人民服务的决心。

　　太原私营晋成营造厂
    转包工程进行中间剥削
    造成工人及工程的严重损失编辑同志：
    太原市私营晋成营造厂，变相转包工程，进行封建性的中间剥削，并且在施工中不按设计图样进行，致使某些工程发生很大危险。
    晋成营造厂承包复聚车行、华丰商行等铺面楼房九处，该营造厂竟从承包总工价中非法抽取百分之二十，然后以“集体计件”、“劳合班”、“评分制”等名义将工程转包给包工把头姚银槐、郑海青、徐大文、吕仁勇等四人。因为这样层层转包，竟使得四十多名工人没有得到太原市的最低标准的工资。包工把头姚银槐私自向晋成营造厂转包德生成的铺面工程时，因为市建设局不准未经登记的营造厂私自承包工程，所以姚银槐就以包价中的百分之二十给予晋成营造厂而买得了晋成营造厂的图记。
    在施工进行中，晋成营造厂只要把工程包出了，自己就不再监督管理，听凭不懂工程设计的工头去执行施工，或盲目听任业主改变工程作法。红市街某楼房工程在施工时，未经建筑师同意，就把楼房下层增长了二公尺，上层又为利用旧料而移动了两道墙的位置，结果这两道墙不是一直砌上去，而是从楼板上从新砌上去的。下层的梁柱，承不起这样的重量，全幢楼房发生危险。
    以上情况先后经工人告发，或经建设局检查发现。现在一方面追缴非法克扣的工资以便补给工人外，并限令晋成营造厂对那些发生很大危险的建筑，从新翻造。

　　泸溪县武溪镇税务局不应擅自降低税率编辑同志：
    湖南泸溪县城所属的武溪镇税务所，长期不按规定的税率征收营业税。如桐油的营业税，按规定应征百分之三，但该所怕计算麻烦，单图简便，也按食油一样只征百分之二。今年四月初，国营泸溪县贸易公司，发现此情形，曾向该所负责同志提过意见，但没有被重视，反说：“桐油不是主业。”并且在今年五月二日送给泸溪贸易公司一张便条说：“我镇无桐油专业，其少数桐油营业部分，系合并主要油盐业（指食油）部分内课以百分之二的营业税。”但该镇除兼营桐油的不计外，实际专营桐油的商号，就有同益、复诚、郑立昌等四家（去年有六家）。又以武溪镇整个市场来说，桐油资金占市场资金总额百分之七十。该税务所从去年四月成立到现在，一年多来对桐油营业税少收了百分之一的税款，累积起来数字是相当大的。就以泸溪贸易公司今年一至五月运出的十五万多斤桐油来说，每担价以四十万元计算，少收的营业税就有六百万元。而泸溪贸易公司收购的桐油仅占该市场桐油业交易额的三分之一。该所擅自修改国家的税收法令，使国家财政收入受到很大损失。这种作法是绝不容许的，希望他们检讨改正。
