    Second-Rate Pickpockets
    The British Labour government has offered the British Isles to the United States as American military bases for land, sea, and air forces. Conversely, it has also concluded a secret agreement with the third-rate lackey of the Atlantic aggressive bloc—the Dutch government—in an attempt to turn the Netherlands into its barracks. According to this agreement, Britain can establish military bases, armories, barracks, and other military constructions in the Netherlands. This shameless and despicable action by the Labour imperialists shows that it is a second-rate pickpocket.
　 Wall Street's Real Sorrow
    Under the instructions of its American masters, the Yoshida reactionary government has expanded the "Police Reserve Force" to 125,000 men. The "Reserve Force" now possesses light and heavy machine guns, carbines, and armored vehicles, and will soon receive tanks. American instructors and "American equipment" continue to pour into the "Reserve Force" to enhance its "material strength." However, whether it is "American equipment" or "Japanese equipment," it must be used by people. So, what is the "fighting spirit" of the current Japanese soldiers? This is a great headache for Wall Street bosses and their Japanese servants. Therefore, they have set up investigation departments and military courts in the "Reserve Force" to guard against those Japanese soldiers who are unwilling to sell their lives for Wall Street's profits. This is the real sorrow of the Washington ruling group, a sorrow they can never eliminate.

    二流的扒手
    英国工党政府把英伦三岛献给美国，作为美国的陆海空军事基地。反过来，它又与大西洋侵略集团内的三等喽啰——荷兰政府缔结秘密协定，企图把荷兰变成它的兵营。按照这个协定，英国可在荷兰建立军事基地、军火库、兵营及其他军事建筑。工党帝国主义分子这一无耻的与卑鄙的行动说明它是个二流的扒手。
　 华尔街真正的悲哀
    吉田反动政府在其美国主子指使下，已将“警察后备队”扩增至十二万五千人。“后备队”现已拥有轻重机枪、卡宾枪与装甲车辆，不久还可得到坦克。美国教官和“美式装备”继续拥进“后备队”以增强它的“物质力量”。但是，“美式装备”也好，“日式装备”也好，都是要由人来使用的，那吗，现在的日本兵的“战斗精神”怎样呢？这就使华尔街老板及其日本仆役大伤脑筋了。于是，他们在“后备队”中设置了调查部门与军事法庭，来防范那些不愿为华尔街的利润卖命的日本士兵。这是华盛顿统治集团真正的悲哀，这个悲哀是他们永远无法消除的。
