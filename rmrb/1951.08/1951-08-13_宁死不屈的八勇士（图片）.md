    Jiang Ping ( 作 = made/painted)
    (Thirteen) Communist Party member He Chengyu, hugging his machine gun, took one last look at the enemies in front of him with hatred, and jumped off the cliff without hesitation. Then, Party members Cui Xuecai, Zhang Qiuchang, and Meng Qingxiu also jumped.
    (Fourteen) An American soldier rushed up,妄想(妄想 = vainly attempting) to capture Hou Tianyou alive, who was providing cover; Hou Tianyou used his last bullet to end the dog's life of this American devil, and then all the heroes jumped off the cliff.
    (Fifteen) In six hours of bloody battle, the eight heroes killed more than one hundred American devils.

    （十四）一个美国兵冲上来，妄想活捉打掩护的侯天佑；侯天佑就用最后一粒子弹结束了这个美国鬼子的狗命，然后勇士们全部跳下悬崖。
    （十五）八勇士在六小时的血战中，共打死了一百多个美国鬼子。
