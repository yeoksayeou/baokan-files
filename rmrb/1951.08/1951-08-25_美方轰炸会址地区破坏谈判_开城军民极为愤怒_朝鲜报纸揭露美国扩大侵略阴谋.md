Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 24th: The military and civilians of Kaesong, who witnessed the U.S. aircraft attacking the Kaesong armistice negotiation conference area on the evening of the 22nd, expressed great indignation at the U.S. side's audacious crime of deliberately undermining the armistice negotiation conference. A certain squad of our military police forces, which was on duty during the enemy aircraft's intrusion last night, held a discussion on this matter on the morning of the 23rd. The soldiers unanimously stated: Our tolerance has reached its limit. Soldier Lu Yanzhi said: "Last night, when the U.S. aircraft flew low, everyone said: They are going to drop bombs. At that time, I was still thinking: Last time, the U.S. and Rhee troops killed our Platoon Leader Yao in Panmunjom, and we protested. Could they do such a conscienceless thing again? Unexpectedly, before I could finish my sentence, the bombs exploded beside me. The U.S. imperialists are really wolves and dogs and don't want peace at all." Another soldier, Li Qikun, said: "Do the U.S. imperialists think we are easy to bully? They are really blind. If they don't want an armistice, we will smash them to pieces."

　　An old lady in Kaesong City in her fifties said: "The Americans first sent infantry into the neutral zone to kill Platoon Leader Yao, and then bombed with airplanes last night. If they want to undermine the negotiations, they are simply unreasonable." An old man said: "The American devils dare to undermine the negotiations like this. We must use even greater efforts to help our army defeat them."

Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: Tass, Pyongyang, August 24th: Korean newspapers generally commented on the U.S. side's provocative behavior in trying to break down the Kaesong armistice negotiations. These newspapers pointed out that the United Nations aircraft strafing the vehicles of the Korean delegation going to Kaesong, the U.S. and Rhee soldiers shooting into the neutral zone, and the U.S. aircraft bombing Kaesong are a series of planned actions to obstruct and undermine the negotiations.

　　The *Rodong Sinmun* published an editorial entitled "U.S. Imperialism's Provocative Acts to Break Down the Kaesong Negotiations," stating that the entire process of the Kaesong negotiations clearly proves that the U.S. representatives have repeatedly tried to obstruct or delay the negotiations for a long time. In order to achieve this goal, the U.S. side issued an ultimatum demanding that United Nations reporters be allowed to interview the Kaesong negotiations, refused to discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, made absurd demands regarding the establishment of a demarcation line, and finally ordered the U.S. and Rhee troops to repeatedly provoke in the neutral zone.

　　The U.S. government's participation in the negotiations is clearly intended to use the negotiations as a smokescreen to prepare for expanded aggression. The following facts prove this: After the start of the negotiations, the United Nations armed forces soon launched fierce offensives on all fronts and intensified air and naval activities. They began to barbarously bomb peaceful cities and villages with the aim of massacring peaceful people. All this shows that what the U.S. side is striving for is not peace, but the expansion of war and continued aggression.

　　*Minju Choson*, in an editorial entitled "The U.S. Side's Repeated Infringement on the Kaesong Neutral Zone Has Aroused the Anger of the Entire Korean People," wrote that the U.S. side's provocative actions in the mutually agreed Kaesong neutral zone expose the true conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists, who are preparing to further expand their aggression behind the scenes of the negotiations. The entire Korean people are very angry at the U.S. provocations in Kaesong.

　　美方轰炸会址地区破坏谈判
    开城军民极为愤怒
    朝鲜报纸揭露美国扩大侵略阴谋
    【新华社开城二十四日电】亲眼见到美机二十二日晚袭击开城停战谈判会议地区的开城市军民，对于美方这次胆大包天、居心破坏停战谈判会议的罪行，都表示极大的愤怒。在昨晚敌机侵袭时正在执行任务的我军事警察部队某班，于二十三日晨就此事举行座谈，战士们一致表示：我们的容忍已经到了最后地步了。战士鲁延志说：“昨晚当美机低飞的时候，大家都说：要扔炸弹了。当时我还想：上次美、李军在板门店打死了我们的姚排长，我们抗议了，它还能再干出这种丧尽天良的事情吗？不料我的话还没有说出口，炸弹就在我身边爆炸了。美帝国主义真是狼心狗肺，根本就不要和平。”另一个战士李其坤说：“美帝国主义以为我们可欺吗？那真是瞎眼了，他不愿意停战，我们就把他打得粉碎。”
    开城市的一位五十多岁的老太太说：“美国人先用步兵侵入中立区杀死姚排长，昨晚又用飞机来轰炸，他们想破坏谈判，就根本不讲道理。”一位老大爷说：“美国鬼子竟敢这样破坏谈判，我们一定要用更大的气力来帮助我们的军队打败他们。”
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社平壤二十四日讯：朝鲜报纸普遍评论美方想使开城停战谈判破裂的挑衅行为。这些报纸指出：联合国飞机扫射前往开城的朝鲜代表团的汽车，美李士兵射击中立地区以及美国飞机轰炸开城——这是一连串有计划的行为，是阻碍和破坏谈判的行为。
    《劳动新闻》以《美帝国主义使开城谈判破裂的挑衅行为》为题发表社论称：开城谈判的整个过程清楚地证明美国代表一再设法阻碍或长期拖延谈判。为了达到这个目的，美方最后通牒式地要求允许联合国记者采访开城谈判，拒绝讨论外国军队撤离朝鲜问题，提出关于建立分界线的荒谬要求，最后还命令美李军队在中立地区一再挑衅。
    美国政府参加谈判，显然是想利用谈判作为准备扩大侵略的烟幕。下面的事实证明了这一点：在谈判开始以后，联合国的武装部队不久就在全线发动猛烈进攻，并加紧空军与海军的活动，他们开始野蛮轰炸和平的城市与乡村，目的是要屠杀和平人民。所有这一切都表明了美国方面所争取的不是和平，而是扩大战争与继续侵略。
    《民主朝鲜》在以《美国方面一再侵犯开城中立区已引起朝鲜全体人民的愤怒》为题的社论中写道：美国方面在双方同意的开城中立区内的挑衅行动，暴露了美帝国主义者的真正阴谋，他们在谈判的幕后正准备进一步扩大侵略。朝鲜全体人民对于美国人在开城的挑衅行动非常愤怒。
