　　Suggestions for Curbing Speculative Publishing Activities
       Xǔ Zōngyì
    After reading the article "Critique of Speculative Publications by Speculative Publishers" in the Cultural Life section of the People's Daily on August 16th, I felt it necessary to add some information about speculative publishers. The main characteristics of so-called speculative publishers are their tendency to chase novelty, rush to be first, and produce shoddy work. Currently, publishers with these three characteristics are not "isolated" examples but exist in considerable numbers. For example, the Shanghai Chunming Bookstore, which published books like "Illustrations of the Golden Lotus" and "The Baojia System" before Liberation, and then stole materials to publish "Small Series of Political Knowledge" and "Dictionary of New Terms" after Liberation, is a well-known speculative publisher. In July this year, the Shanghai publishing industry held a symposium of over 140 people to criticize their bad behavior (see Shanghai Liberation Daily, July 12th). Hu Jitai, the head of the editorial department of this speculative bookstore and one of the editors-in-chief of the "Dictionary of New Terms," also admitted at the meeting their "purely economic viewpoint" and consistent pursuit of "more goods out" and "faster goods out" without caring about the quality of the goods. There is no doubt that this bookstore is a speculative publisher.
    Another example is the Dadi Bookstore, which published the "Comprehensive Dictionary of New Terms." Although I haven't seen its other publications, this "Comprehensive Dictionary of New Terms" alone is enough to call it a speculative publisher. This "dictionary," with over 1,500 pages and more than 1.5 million words, can be easily identified as a fabrication with a little patience in checking. It arbitrarily creates "new terms" (for example, "Foreign Minister Zhou's Solemn Statement," "American Planes Repeatedly Invade Our Airspace," etc.) and then provides careless explanations, with incorrect viewpoints, inverted priorities, or simply no explanation at all. Examples abound. This utterly bored editor even pretended to be "humble" and solicited opinions from readers. Many serious readers did give him some opinions. As a result, many absurd "new terms" such as "cadre faction" and "old fritter" were deleted in the second edition, and some corrections were made. It is said that a comrade named Gu Ji in the People's Liberation Army wrote to point out that there were many errors in the military section of this dictionary, and the editor pinned him down, asking him to "visit our Beijing headquarters for a discussion with the editors" in order to entrust him with revising this section (see "Summary Report on Revision Work for the Second Edition," and the "Preface to the Third Edition" of the book still expresses regret that this Comrade Gu Ji is "rarely seen"). This is a typical speculative merchant who is joking with the readers!
    Other examples include the Pacific Publishing House, which published "Dictionary of Chinese People's Terminology"; the Shanghai Wenyuan Publishing House, which copied and printed "Anti-Dühring" (translated by Wu Liping) under the titles "New Philosophical Paradigm," "New Economic Paradigm," and "Socialism"; the Beijing Changyi Bookstore, which published "Liberation Edition High School Entrance Examination Guide"; the Beijing Jianye Bookstore, which published "Liberation High School Entrance Examination Guide"; the Guanghua Bookstore, which published "Latest High School Entrance Examination Guide"; the Wan Guo Bookstore, which published "High School Entrance Examination Guide"; and the Shanghai Teaching Publishing House, Shanghai New Star Bookstore, Shanghai Zhengqi and Yucai Bookstores, which published "Junior High School Entrance Examination Guide"; the Shanghai Hongwen Chengji and Dongxin Qiaji Bookstores, which published "Detailed Explanation of Recent University Entrance Examination Questions," and so on. All of them have demonstrated their speculative nature with their speculative publications.
    Most of the publishers currently engaged in speculation do not have an editorial department, or if they have an editorial department, it is actually just a few bored literati who are copying, cutting, and managing things. As a result, they do everything possible to produce shoddy work and engage in plagiarism. In order to change this phenomenon, I believe that strengthening book review work in newspapers and periodicals, guiding readers, and educating publishers to change their business attitude are certainly very important, but constantly arguing with speculative publishers in criticism and review will not solve the problem. Therefore, I believe that publishing administrative organs should strengthen their leadership over the publishing industry, on the one hand, to ensure that the publishing industry has appropriate division of labor and appropriate publishing plans, and on the other hand, to examine whether they have the conditions to operate in the publishing industry, first and foremost whether they have a qualified editorial department. All publishers who do not have a publishing plan and do not have a qualified editorial department should be ordered to switch to distribution business and not be allowed to continue making trouble. This is my personal superficial opinion, and I offer it for reference to those who are concerned about the publishing industry.

### 建议制止投机出版活动

　　建议制止投机出版活动
       许宗义
    读了人民日报八月十六日文化生活栏《评投机出版商的投机出版物》一文后，我感到有必要把投机出版商的情况作一点补充。所谓投机出版商，它的特点主要是趋新、抢先和粗制滥造。目前具有这三个特点的出版商，可说并非“个别”的存在，而是有一个相当数量的存在。比如在解放前出版过“金瓶梅画册”、“保甲制度”等书，解放后又以偷窃手段出版过“政治常识学习小丛书”及“新名词辞典”等书的上海春明书店便是一家著名的投机出版商。今年七月间上海出版界曾经举行过一次一百四十多人的座谈会来批评他们的恶劣行为（见七月十二日上海解放日报）。这家投机书店的编辑部负责人、“新名词辞典”主编之一胡济涛，也在会上承认了他们的“单纯经济观点”及一贯只求“出货多”、“出货快”、不求出货好的事实。这家书店之为投机出版商，可以说是没有疑义的了。
    又如出版“新名词综合大辞典”的大地书店，我虽然还没有看过它的其他出版物，但即以这部“新名词综合大辞典”而言，也就够称为投机出版商了。这部一千五百多页一百五十多万字的“大辞典”，只要稍微耐心翻查一下，就可以知道是瞎编出来的，随便制造“新名词”（举例：“周外长严正声明”、“美机屡次侵我领空”等等），又信口加以解释，观点错误，轻重倒置或根本没有说明什么，例子举不胜举。这位无聊透顶的编者，甚至还做出一副“虚心”的样子向读者讨教。有许多认真的读者也确乎给过他一些意见。于是在再版时才删掉许多岂有此理的“新名词”，如“干部派”、“老油条”等等，并作了一些修正。据说人民解放军中有位署名古极的同志曾去信指出这部辞典的军事部分有很多错误，就被编者钉住，要他“驾临北京本店与编者一谈”，以便委托他修改这一部分（见《再版修改工作总结报告》，又该书《三版的话》中尚以这位古极同志“神龙见首不见尾”而大表遗恨。）这是典型的跟读者开玩笑的投机商！
    再如出版《中国人民术语辞典》的太平洋出版社，以《新哲学典范》、《新经济学典范》及《社会主义》为书名抄印《反杜林论》（吴理屏译本）的上海文源出版社，出版《解放版高小升学指导》的北京昌益书局，出版《解放高小升学指导》的北京建业书店，出版《最新高小升学指导》的光华书店，出版《高小升学指导》的万国书店以及出版《初中投考指南》的上海教学出版社，上海新星书店，上海正气、育才书店，出版《最近大学入学试题详解》的上海宏文成记、东新洽记书局等等，也都以他们的投机出版物表明了他们的投机性。
    目前经营投机的出版商大抵都没有编辑部，或有编辑部而实际只是有几个无聊文人为之抄剪和张罗而已，结果乃粗制滥造、鼠窃狗偷之事无所不为。为了改变这种现象，我以为加强报纸刊物的书评工作，指导读者并教育出版商改变他们的经营态度，固然非常重要，但是老是在批评检讨中跟投机出版商纠缠，并不能解决问题。所以我以为出版行政机关应当加强对出版事业的领导，一方面要使出版业有适当的分工和适当的出版计划，一方面要审查他们是否有经营出版业的条件，首先是否有一个合格的编辑部。凡是没有出版计划和没有合格的编辑部的出版社，都应当责令他们改营发行事业，不要让他们继续胡闹下去。这是我个人的一点粗浅的意见，特提供关心出版界状况者参考。
