Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: According to a report from Kaesong by Xinmin Daily special correspondent Sha Jun: The U.S. side, while using the excuse that our side's neutral zone guard troops mistakenly entered the conference area to deliberately delay the meeting, created an incident on the 7th where U.S. troops attacked the Panmunjom neutral zone. This has aroused extreme indignation among people in Kaesong. However, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the meeting and avoid further complications, our delegation once again expressed its sincerity towards the meeting, only ordering our liaison officer to notify the other side to pay attention. Our side's calm and rational handling of such incidents in order to ensure the smooth progress of the armistice negotiations stands in sharp contrast to the other side's unreasonable attitude of making a fuss over a minor issue and obstructing the negotiations. It is now clear which side has genuine sincerity for peace. It should also be pointed out that the U.S. side's provocative behavior on August 7th was by no means an accidental event, but a deliberate attempt to sabotage the Kaesong negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: According to a report from Kaesong by Weiningdun, a reporter for the British London Workers' Daily: The U.S. side deliberately sabotaged the negotiations, and on the 7th, even dispatched 40 U.S. troops to attack Panmunjom in the neutral zone, destroying the neutrality of the Kaesong area. Among them, six people, one carrying a pistol and the rest carrying automatic weapons, under the cover of light and heavy machine guns, walked to a place less than 200 meters from Panmunjom, repeatedly firing at unarmed personnel in the neutral zone. The reporter clearly heard the gunshots. This incident of destroying neutrality was a shooting incident, different from the trivial matter of Joe merely protesting that he saw some armed police passing by. This is by no means an accidental event, and one cannot help but suspect that it was decided by the highest levels. Lower-level officers would never dare to take such action in this area at this time. Despite this, the Korean and Chinese delegations are not using this new incident as a reason to further delay negotiations. They are here to discuss peace, not to find ways to make excuses for war. They only issued a notice to Joe, asking him to "pay serious attention" to this new incident.

　　中外记者评板门店事件
    【新华社十日讯】据此间新民报特派记者沙军发自开城的报道称：美方在借口我方中立区警卫部队误入会场地区、故意拖延会议同时，于七日制造美军攻击中立区板门店的事件，已引起开城人士的极端愤慨。但我方代表团为使会议顺利进行，避免节外生枝，再度表示对会议的真诚，仅命令我方联络官通知对方注意。我方这种为了停战谈判能够顺利进行而冷静、合理地处理此类事件的态度，与对方小题大做，阻挠谈判的无理态度恰成一明显的对比。那方对和平有真正诚意，已昭然若揭。更应指明的是，美方八月七日的挑衅行为，决不是偶然的事件，而是对开城谈判的一种蓄意破坏。
    【新华社十日讯】据英国伦敦工人日报记者魏宁顿发自开城的报道称：美方蓄意破坏谈判，七日竟派遣美军四十名攻击中立区内的板门店，破坏开城地区的中立，其中有六个人，一个带着手枪，其余的人带着自动武器，在轻重机枪的掩护下走到距板门店不到二百公尺的地方，一再向中立区的没有武装的人员射击。记者清楚地听到枪声。这次破坏中立的事件是一种开枪射击的事件，不同于乔埃仅看到若干武装警察走过就提出抗议的那种枝节小事。这绝不可能是一个偶然的事件，这不能不使人怀疑是最高级方面决定的。下级军官绝不敢在这个地区、在这个时候采取这种行动。尽管这样，朝鲜和中国代表团还是不把这个新事件当作进一步延宕谈判的理由。他们在这里是讨论和平，而不是想尽方法去为战争找借口。他们仅发给乔埃一个通知，要他“严重注意”这个新事件。
