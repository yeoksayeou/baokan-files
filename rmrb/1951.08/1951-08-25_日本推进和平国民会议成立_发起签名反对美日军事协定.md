Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 24th: Under the influence of the peace movement's widespread development among all strata of Japanese society, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), a conservative labor organization, its affiliated unions, and the Religious Peace Movement Council and other groups, held the inaugural meeting of the "Japan National Conference for the Promotion of Peace" on July 28th.

The inaugural meeting decided that the purpose of the conference is to unite all forces that safeguard the Japanese constitution, which stipulates non-armament, in order to realize the basic conditions for peace and independence. The inaugural meeting issued a statement saying that Japan should "not sign military agreements with any country, and should absolutely avoid concluding one-sided peace treaties that put it at odds with some countries. It should conclude equal and conciliatory peace treaties with all belligerent countries, and resolutely adhere to Japan's non-armament constitution."

The inaugural meeting adopted the conference's current activity plan and resolved to launch a signature campaign against the rearmament of Japan and the signing of a US-Japan military agreement. The resolution pointed out that the separate peace treaty with Japan, which is being actively prepared, including secret military agreements hostile to certain countries, will open the way for the rearmament of Japan. "This is very serious and cannot but be said to be related to the rise and fall of the Japanese nation in the future."

The inaugural meeting adopted a number of slogans, including: Defend the peaceful constitution; Demand an overall peace; Oppose rearmament; Oppose military agreements; Guarantee freedom of speech, assembly, and association.

　　日本推进和平国民会议成立
    发起签名反对美日军事协定
    【新华社二十四日讯】东京消息：在和平运动在日本各阶层中广泛展开的影响下，日本保守的劳工组织日本工会总评议会及其所属工会和宗教界和平运动协议会等团体，于七月二十八日举行了“日本推进和平国民会议”成立大会。
    成立大会决定该会的目的是：团结一切保卫规定日本非武装的宪法的力量，以期实现和平与独立的基本条件。成立大会发表声明书说：日本应该“不与任何国家签订军事协定，更应绝对避免缔结与一部分国家陷于敌对关系的片面和约。应该和一切交战国缔结平等的、和解的和约，坚决严守日本的非武装宪法。”
    成立大会通过了该会当前活动的计划，并决议发起反对日本重新武装与签订美日军事协定的签名投票运动。决议指出：正在积极准备的单独对日和约，包括以某些国家为敌国的秘密军事协定在内，将要打开重新武装日本的道路。“这是非常严重的，不能不说是关系今后日本民族的兴亡”。
    成立大会通过了一些口号，包括：保卫和平宪法；要求全面媾和；反对重整军备；反对军事协定；保障言论、集会、结社自由。
