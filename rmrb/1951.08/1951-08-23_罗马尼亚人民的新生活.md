　　New Life of the Romanian People
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd] The 23rd is the 7th anniversary of the liberation of Romania. In the past seven years, the Romanian people have created a happy new life through their own efforts. Workers' wages increased by about 45 percent in the two years of 1949 and 1950, and this year's wage fund has increased by 15 percent compared to 1950. In addition, the benefits Romanian workers receive from medical care, vacations, and social services are equivalent to about 20 percent of their wages. The sales volume of consumer goods has been increasing every year. In 1950, the trade volume of Romanian state-owned and cooperative stores increased by 30 percent compared to 1949, and it will increase by another 33 percent this year.

    In industrial centers such as Bucharest, Stalin, and Reșița, workers' residential areas have been established. The living space for the working people completed in 1950 alone covers an area of 370,000 square meters. The government also provides loans to working people to build individual houses.

    In the seven years since liberation, Romania has established thousands of medical and health institutions and expanded the facilities of existing medical and health institutions. The number of hospital beds nationwide is now 60 percent higher than in 1945. Medical conditions in rural areas have also been greatly improved. Since liberation, 2,000 well-equipped medical centers have been established in rural areas. During the harvest season of 1950, the number of first-aid stations in rural areas increased by 12,000. Last year, 130,000 mothers with many children received state subsidies of 940 million lei. This year, 280,000 workers and children are vacationing in sanatoriums, 55,000 more than last year.

    Having escaped poverty, the Romanian working people have also experienced a cultural transformation. Of the 4.2 million illiterate people left over from old Romania, 1.6 million have been eliminated in the past three years. All school-age children in Romania now attend national schools. The number of primary school students is now 25 times that of the pre-war period, and the number of university students has increased by 31,000 compared to the pre-war period. The trade unions alone have established 12,000 libraries with a collection of approximately 4.5 million books, and there are 6,000 amateur art groups sponsored by trade unions nationwide. By May of last year, the libraries in rural clubs had exceeded 11,500.

　　罗马尼亚人民的新生活
    【新华社二十二日讯】二十三日，是罗马尼亚解放七周年纪念日。七年来罗马尼亚人民用自己的努力创造了幸福的新生活，工人工资在一九四九年和一九五○年两年内增加了约百分之四十五，今年的工资基金又比一九五○年增加了百分之十五。此外，罗马尼亚工人从医疗、休假、社会服务等方面所得的利益，约等于工资的百分之二十。消费品的销售量每年都有增加，一九五○年罗马尼亚国营和合作社商店贸易额比一九四九年增加了百分之三十，今年还要再增加百分之三十三。
    在布加勒斯特、斯大林、列西塔等工业中心，工人住宅区已建立起来，单是一九五○年完工的劳动人民的住宅，地面面积就有三十七万平方公尺。政府还贷款给劳动人民建造个人住宅。
    在解放以来的七年中，罗马尼亚已设立了几千所医药和卫生机关，并且扩充了旧有的医药和卫生机关的设备。现在全国病床数目已比一九四五年增加了百分之六十。乡村的医疗条件也大大改进。解放后乡村中已设立了二千个设备完善的医疗中心，在一九五○年收获季节，乡村中的急救站增加了一万二千个。去年有十三万子女众多的母亲得到国家的补助金罗币九亿四千万列伊。今年有二十八万工人和儿童在疗养地度假，比去年多五万五千人。
    脱离了贫困的罗马尼亚劳动人民在文化上也翻身了。旧罗马尼亚留下来的四百二十万文盲，在最近三年便消灭了一百六十万。罗马尼亚现在所有学龄儿童都进国民学校读书。现在小学生人数为战前的二十五倍，大学生比战前增加三万一千人。单是工会设立的图书馆就有一万二千所，藏书约四百五十万册，全国由工会主办的业余艺术团体有六千个。到去年五月为止，乡村俱乐部的图书室已超过一万一千五百处。
