　　“American Peace Crusaders” Call on Domestic People to Oppose US Government's Obstruction of Negotiations
    [Xinhua News Agency, 6th] TASS, New York, 6th: The secretary of "American Peace Crusaders", Reverend Uphouse and Richardson, issued a statement to the press calling on all peace-loving Americans to demand that the US government no longer obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations.
    The statement said: "At present, because the issue of extending the buffer zone north of the 38th parallel has been raised, the truce negotiations may break down at any time, and the already terrible killings and destruction may become even more terrible. World peace may be infinitely endangered. Why do our officials adopt this stubborn and uncompromising attitude? This is certainly not the attitude of the American people."
    The statement then urged the people to demand that Truman instruct the US negotiators to bring the ceasefire negotiations to a swift and successful conclusion.

　　“美国和平十字军”号召国内人民
    反对美政府阻挠谈判
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社纽约六日讯：“美国和平十字军”干事乌法斯牧师与李查逊向报界发表声明，号召一切爱好和平的美国人要求美国政府不再阻碍朝鲜停火谈判。
    声明说：“目前，因为提出了把缓冲区伸延到三八线以北的问题，休战谈判可能随时破裂，已经很可怕的杀戮与毁坏可能要变得更加可怕。世界和平可能受到无限的危害。我们的官员为什么采取这种顽固的不妥协的态度呢？这当然不是美国人民的态度。”
    声明于是敦促人民要求杜鲁门训令美国谈判代表使停火谈判迅速顺利结束。
