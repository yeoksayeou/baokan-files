            Agriculture Cannot Improve Without Industry
　　The state-owned and private machine factories in Xi'an are implementing a production policy geared towards the countryside, stepping up the production of new-style farm implements to meet the increasing needs of agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics from the first half of this year, the factories have manufactured more than 11,000 new-style waterwheels, walking plows, grass cutters, cotton gins, and other implements for farmers. In order to "manufacture new-style farm implements to supply the needs of our farmer brothers," the city's machine workers enthusiastically launched a production competition campaign. In order to provide farmers with inexpensive, high-quality farm implements, the factory workers also focused on improving quality and reducing costs during the production competition. After using the new-style farm implements, farmers in various regions have generally seen an increase in production efficiency. According to a survey in Hua County, Shaanxi, the efficiency of irrigation with the Liberation-style waterwheel is twice that of the old-style waterwheel. The cotton yield from fields using the new plows at the Wugong Farm Implement Station is much higher than the yield from fields using the old plows. A significant increase in agricultural production is forever inseparable from the development of industry.
            Empty Talk of Politics, Separated from Production, Is Also Wrong
　　A reader's letter published in the Shanxi Daily on July 27th stated: The cotton aphid infestation in Yuxiang County is very severe. For example, cotton in Nanguo Village is expected to suffer a two-thirds reduction in yield due to cotton aphids. Therefore, cotton farmers urgently demand control measures. However, the work team cadres living in the village only shout political slogans such as resolving land reform issues, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and resisting America and aiding Korea, without linking them to production. Every night, they hold either activist meetings or mass meetings, without mentioning the farmers' urgent need to control aphids. This has aroused dissatisfaction among the masses, who say, "When will the work team leave?" This matter demonstrates that empty talk of "politics" without regard for the economic demands of the masses is just as wrong as a purely economic viewpoint that does not care about politics. Only by combining political and economic work can political movements be deepened and sustained, and only then can political movements become a material force.

            农业要想提高就离不了工业
    西安市国营及私营机器工厂执行面向农村的生产方针，加紧生产新式农具，以满足农业生产日益增加的需要。据今年上半年不完全统计，各厂已为农民制造了各种新式的水车、步犁、铲草机、轧花机等一万一千多部。为了“制造新式农具，供应农民兄弟的需要”，该市机器工人曾热烈地开展了生产竞赛运动。各厂职工为使农民得到廉价物美的农具，在生产竞赛中还注意提高质量和减低成本。各地农民使用新式农具后，生产效率普遍提高。据陕西华县调查，解放式水车浇水的效率比旧式水车提高一倍。武功农具站用新犁的棉田的产量比用旧犁的产量高得多。农业生产要大大地提高，是和工业的发展永远也分不开的。
            空谈政治脱离生产也是不对的
    山西日报七月二十七日发表的一封读者来信中说：虞乡县的棉蚜灾害十分厉害，如南郭村棉花因发生棉蚜，要减收三分之二。因此，棉农迫切要求除治。但住在该村的区工作队干部，却只喊解决土地改革遗留问题，镇压反革命、抗美援朝等政治口号，不结合生产。每天晚上不是开积极分子会，就是群众会，对群众迫切的除蚜工作，提也不提。因此，引起群众的不满。他们说：“工作队几时才走呢？”这件事情说明了，空谈“政治”而不顾群众的经济要求，和单纯经济观点，不关心政治，同样是错误的。只有把政治和经济工作结合起来，才能使政治运动深入持久下去，政治运动才能成为物质力量。
