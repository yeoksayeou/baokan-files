Comrades, fellow representatives:

The First National Elementary Education Conference and the First National Normal Education Conference, which everyone has been anticipating for a long time, are officially opened today in a combined session.

Elementary education is the foundation of people's education. Raising the people's cultural level and cultivating talent for national construction both depend on this foundation. Now, in order to meet the urgent demands of the broad masses for culture, how to prepare for and gradually implement universal education, and better educate the new generation of the motherland, has become our extremely important task. Normal education, for the cultivation and improvement of teachers at all levels, is the decisive key to whether the entire people's education undertaking can be well-run and developed. If this problem cannot be well resolved, the most important cadre training plan in national construction will not be realized. Therefore, this conference is of great significance for the development of education and various construction undertakings in New China.

In the past two years, elementary education across the country has developed greatly. At present, there are 2,146 preschool education institutions nationwide, with a total of 145,900 children; there are 438,711 elementary schools, with 35,872,667 students. This already exceeds the pre-war level. At the same time, old liberated area elementary schools have made significant progress in consolidation and improvement, and new area elementary schools have made significant progress in transformation. This great achievement is the result of the efforts of all education workers under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, especially the hard work of more than one million elementary school teachers under extremely difficult conditions. However, at present, elementary education institutions across the country, especially elementary schools, still feel that the number is small and the capacity is limited, which is far from meeting the needs of the people; the quality of many elementary schools is also very poor. At the same time, elementary education funding is still very difficult, and rural teachers' salaries are very low, which has created a state of instability in elementary education in some areas. Based on these circumstances, this conference should resolve the following issues regarding elementary education:

First, it is necessary to clearly define the direction and tasks of children's elementary education. We should, based on the nature of the people's democratic dictatorship state and society, based on the good experience of elementary education in the old liberated areas, absorb some usable experience from the old elementary education, and also draw on the advanced experience of Soviet elementary education, to define the direction and tasks of our country's elementary education, and discuss and pass the "Provisional Regulations for Elementary Schools" and "Provisional Regulations for Kindergartens" (draft), as well as the "Elementary School Teaching Syllabus" and "Kindergarten Education and Nurturing Work Plan." So that New China's elementary education can achieve correct and sound development.

Second, determine the principles for raising and spending elementary education funds and appropriately improve the treatment of elementary school teachers. In the past two years, due to the rapid development of elementary schools, elementary education funding in various places has generally felt difficult, and some have even lowered the salaries of elementary school teachers or cut and merged elementary schools, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. This is a serious problem in current education construction and should be studied for a proper solution based on the principle of combining overall planning by local governments and relying on the masses. At present, elementary school teachers, especially rural elementary school teachers, have very heavy workloads and live very hard lives. The Central People's Government is very concerned about this issue. The treatment of elementary school teachers, like the treatment of other workers across the country, cannot be greatly improved until the country's financial and economic situation has fundamentally improved and the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is still ongoing. However, under the conditions of possible government financial strength and mass burden, we must strive to appropriately improve the treatment of elementary school teachers so that everyone can work with peace of mind, which is conducive to the consolidation and development of elementary education.

Third, determine the implementation steps for promoting the new elementary education system nationwide. The "Decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on the Reform of the School System" has been adopted by the State Council meeting and will be promulgated and implemented soon. How to formulate an implementation plan to gradually change the four-two elementary school system to a five-year continuous system, according to the decision of the State Council and with reference to the actual conditions in various places, especially the characteristics of minority areas, this issue needs to be discussed in detail by the conference.

In addition, I also hope that everyone will fully exchange opinions on how to strengthen local education administrative leadership and the curriculum standards for elementary school subjects.

Regarding normal education: At present, there are 603 secondary normal schools nationwide, with 167,281 students, and another 20,886 students in short-term teacher training classes. A total of 188,167 people. There are 29 higher normal schools (including 13 colleges affiliated with universities), with a total of 12,564 students. The problems currently existing in normal education are, first of all, the educational guidelines, tasks, school system, teaching plans, and administrative systems of normal schools at all levels are inconsistent in various places. In particular, the establishment of departments in higher normal schools is mostly unreasonable and far from meeting the needs of training a large number of secondary school teachers. The distribution of secondary normal schools is such that there are more in the old areas and fewer in the new areas, more junior normal schools and fewer normal schools. Overall, the establishment and development are very unbalanced. At present, teachers are generally lacking in schools at all levels, and there is a greater shortage of elementary education teachers. The existing secondary normal schools are far from being able to complete the task of cultivating teachers. In addition, some incumbent teachers must be trained to improve their quality, which further increases the task of secondary normal schools. Therefore, normal schools of all levels and types must be adjusted and developed, especially to run more short-term teacher training classes and crash courses, in order to achieve the purpose of supplying a large number of teachers. Secondly, there is no set of suitable teaching materials for normal schools at all levels, especially for professional courses, there is a lack of new teaching materials, which makes teaching extremely difficult. We must gradually solve this problem with emphasis. As for the treatment of teachers and students in normal schools at all levels, it also has a certain impact on the current unstable and unconsolidated normal education. We should gradually solve these problems. Of course, we cannot solve all the problems at this conference. We must focus on solving the following two problems:

First, determine the direction and tasks of normal schools of all levels and types. Normal education is the central link in the entire education construction. If the teacher problem is not solved, the high tide of cultural construction will be difficult to arrive, and even affect economic construction. Therefore, we ask all education workers and leaders at all levels to pay attention to this issue. The most important issue at present is to immediately stop the chaotic phenomenon in normal education, appropriately improve the treatment of teachers and students, consolidate and improve the professional spirit of teachers serving the people, stabilize normal schools at all levels, and strive for development on the basis of consolidation. Secondly, we should clearly define the task of secondary normal schools, which is to train teachers for elementary schools and kindergartens, and teachers for some industrial and agricultural spare-time schools. The task of higher normal schools is to train teachers for ordinary middle schools, workers' and peasants' quick-course middle schools, and normal schools, as well as teachers for general courses in other secondary vocational schools. The new teachers of all levels and types of schools that we train must be people's teachers armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, who are proficient in their professions and wholeheartedly serve the people's education cause. Such teachers will surely be respected by the government and the people, and loved by young people and children. In order to achieve this goal, this conference will discuss and determine the teaching plans for normal schools of all levels and types, and formulate the regulations for normal schools of all levels and types. And exchange opinions on the draft curriculum of higher normal schools, and the curriculum standards for education, psychology and other subjects in normal schools.

Second, formulate a national plan for the establishment of secondary normal schools and the principles for adjusting and establishing higher normal schools. At present, there are still many difficulties in terms of teachers, funding, and student sources. But New China is a revolutionary China, a China of the people. We must use the revolutionary spirit and rely on the people to overcome all difficulties and cultivate a large number of teachers. Regarding the establishment of higher normal schools, each major administrative region must set up a normal college directly led by the education department of the major administrative region; each province and major city should set up a normal college, and if conditions permit, it should also set up a normal college; the education departments established by the original university liberal arts colleges should be merged and transformed as a principle. Various types of secondary normal schools should strive for development, and pay attention to correcting the unbalanced development in the past, especially to set up more short-term teacher training classes and crash courses to meet the needs of gradually popularizing elementary education. This is a huge task. How to determine the key points of development in this process, how to divide the labor in establishment between the province and its subordinate counties and cities, how to coordinate the cooperation between regular schools and short-term training classes, and how to improve the quality of in-service teachers in a planned and step-by-step manner, etc., I hope everyone will study and discuss carefully.

### 马叙伦部长的开幕词

专栏：

　　马叙伦部长的开幕词各位代表、各位同志：
    大家期待了很久的第一次全国初等教育会议与第一次全国师范教育会议，今天合并举行，正式开幕了。
    初等教育是人民的基础教育，提高人民文化水平，培养国家建设人才，均有赖于这个基础。现在为适应广大群众对文化的迫切要求，如何准备和逐步推行普及教育，更好地教育祖国新生的一代，已成为我们的极重要的任务。而师范教育，对于各级师资的培养与提高，又是整个人民教育事业能否办好与能否发展的决定关键，这个问题如不能很好解决，国家建设中最重要的干部培养计划亦将无法实现。因此，这次会议对于新中国教育事业以及各种建设事业的开展，都是很有意义的。
    两年以来，全国初等教育已有很大的发展，目前全国共有幼儿教育机关二千一百四十六所，有儿童共十四万五千九百人；共有小学四十三万八千七百十一所，学生三千五百八十七万二千六百六十七人。已经超过战前的水平。同时老区小学在巩固提高方面，新区小学在改造方面，都有了显著的进步。这一巨大成绩，是在中央人民政府正确领导之下全体教育工作者努力的结果，特别是百余万小学教师在极困难的条件下艰苦工作的结果。但是现在全国初等教育机关特别是小学仍感数量少、容量小，还远远不能满足人民群众的需要；许多小学的质量也还很差。同时目前初等教育经费还很困难，农村教师待遇很低，以致造成某些地区小学教育不很稳定的状态。根据这些情况，关于初等教育方面这次会议应该解决下列问题：
    第一、要明确地规定儿童初等教育的方针和任务。我们应该根据人民民主专政的国家社会性质，以老解放区初等教育的良好经验为基础，吸收旧有的初等教育某些可用的经验，还要借助于苏联初等教育先进的经验，来规定我国初等教育的方针和任务，讨论和通过小学暂行规程及幼儿园暂行规程（草案）、小学教学总纲及幼儿园教养工作计划。使新中国初等教育得到正确和健全的发展。
    第二、确定初等教育经费的筹支原则和适当地改善小学教师的待遇。近两年来，由于小学的迅速发展，各地初等教育经费普遍地感到困难，有的甚至降低小学教师的工薪或裁并小学，致使群众不满，这是目前教育建设中一个严重的问题，应根据地方政府统筹和依靠群众相结合的方针，研究一个妥善的解决办法。目前小学教师，特别是农村小学教师的工作很繁重，生活很艰苦，中央人民政府很关心这个问题。小学教师的待遇，和全国其他职工的待遇一样，在国家财政经济状况还未根本好转，抗美援朝的战争还在进行的情况下，不能有大的提高。但是在政府财政力量与群众负担可能的条件下，我们必须努力设法适当地改善小学教师的待遇，使大家能安心工作，以利于初等教育事业的巩固和发展。
    第三、确定在全国范围内推行初等教育新学制的实施步骤。《中央人民政府政务院关于改革学制的决定》已经政务院会议通过，不久即可公布施行。如何根据政务院的决定，并且参酌各地实际情况，特别是少数民族地区的特点，拟定逐步地由四二制小学改为五年一贯制的实施计划，这一问题需要大会详细地加以讨论。
    此外，我还希望大家关于如何加强地方教育行政领导问题和小学各科的课程标准充分地交换意见。
    师范教育方面：现在全国共有中等师范学校六○三所，学生一六七、二八一人，另有短期师资训练班学生二○、八八六人。共计一八八、一六七人。高等师范学校二十九所（内有十三个学院是附属于大学的），学生共一二、五六四人。目前师范教育中存在着的问题，首先是各级师范学校的教育方针、任务、学制、教学计划以及行政制度等等，各地实施多不一致，特别是高等师范学校系科的设置，多不合理，远还不能适应培养大批中等学校师资的需要。而中等师范学校的分布情况是老区多新区少，初级师范学校多，师范学校少，整个看来，设置和发展是很不平衡的。目前各级学校师资，普遍地感到缺乏，初等教育师资缺的更多，现有中等师范学校，也远不能完成培植师资的任务，加以部分现任教师必须加以训练提高其质量，这就更加重了中等师范学校的任务。因此，各级各类师范学校，都必须调整和发展，特别要多办各种短期师资训练班和速成班，以达到供应大量师资的目的。其次，现在各级师范学校还没有一套合用的教材，特别是业务课，更缺乏新教材，因而进行教学有极大困难。这一问题我们必须有重点地逐步加以解决。至于教师待遇与各级师范学校学生的待遇问题，也给目前师范教育不很稳定和不很巩固以一定的影响。这些问题，我们应该逐步地加以解决。当然，我们这次会议上，不可能把所有的问题都解决了，我们要着重解决以下两个问题：
    第一、确定各级各类师范学校的方针和任务。师范教育是整个教育建设中的中心环节，师资问题如不解决，文化建设的高潮就很难到来，甚至会影响经济建设。因此，我们要求一切教育工作者与各级领导者重视这一问题。当前首要的问题是立即制止师范教育中的混乱现象，适当地改善教师和学生的待遇，巩固和提高教师的为人民服务的专业精神，把各级师范学校安定下来，并在巩固的基础上力求发展。其次，我们应明确规定中等师范学校的任务，是培养小学和幼儿园的师资和部分的工农业余学校的师资。高等师范学校的任务是培养普通中学、工农速成中学、师范学校的师资以及其他中等专业学校普通课的师资。我们所培养的各级各类学校的新师资，必须是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的、熟习业务的、全心全意为人民教育事业服务的人民教师。这种教师是一定能够得到政府和人民的尊重，和青年儿童的爱戴的。为达到这个目的，这次会议要讨论确定各级各类师范学校的教学计划，拟定各级各类师范学校的规程。并就高等师范学校课程草案、师范学校教育学、心理学等科课程标准交换意见。
    第二、拟定全国中等师范学校设置计划与高等师范学校调整设置的原则。现在师资、经费与学生来源等条件，还有很多困难。但是新中国是革命的中国，是人民的中国，我们必须用革命的精神，并依靠人民群众，来克服一切困难，大量地培养师资。关于高等师范学校的设置，每一大行政区必须设一由大行政区教育部直接领导的师范学院；每一省和大市应设一师范专科学校，如有条件，亦得设师范学院；原有大学文学院所设教育科系，以归并改造为原则。各类中等师范学校应力求发展，并注意纠正过去发展不平衡的现象，特别应多设短期师资训练班和速成科，以适应逐步普及初等教育的需要。这是一件巨大的工作，在这当中发展重点如何确定，省与所属县市在设置上如何分工，正规学校与短期训练班如何配合，以及如何有计划有步骤地提高在职教师质量等等问题，都希望大家好好研究讨论。          （新华社）
