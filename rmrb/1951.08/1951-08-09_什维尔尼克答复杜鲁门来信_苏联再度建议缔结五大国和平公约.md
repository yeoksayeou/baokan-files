Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, Moscow, July 7th by TASS: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a memorandum from the American Ambassador Mr. Kirk, requesting that the letter from the American President Mr. Truman and a resolution of the United States Congress be forwarded to the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Mr. Shvernik.

On August 6th, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR passed a resolution. The Soviet Embassy in Washington delivered this resolution, along with a reply letter from the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Mr. Shvernik, to the US State Department on the same day, requesting that it be forwarded to the President of the United States.

Below are the letter from the American President Mr. Truman and the resolution of the American Congress, as well as the reply letter from the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Mr. Shvernik, to this letter, and the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on August 6th.

	Truman's Letter
	President Truman's letter is as follows:

	Your Excellency:

	I have the honor to forward to you a resolution passed by the United States Congress and request that your government publish the contents of this resolution to the people of the Soviet Union.

	This resolution expresses the friendship and goodwill of the American people towards all people in the world, and the resolution reaffirms the deep desire of the United States government to do its utmost to achieve a just and lasting peace.

	I, as the head of the United States, sincerely endorse this resolution. I enclose my own letter to the Soviet people, earnestly hoping that these expressions can promote a better understanding of the purposes and goals of the United States.

	The unpleasant consequences of the past few years show that when there are barriers that hinder the friendly exchange of views and information between the people of various countries, formal diplomatic negotiations between countries will be greatly hampered. The greatest hope for a peaceful world lies in the desire for peace and brotherly love in the depths of everyone's heart. However, people who do not have access to normal means of communication will not be able to achieve mutual understanding, which is a necessary foundation for trust and friendship. Before allowing free and open exchange of information across international borders, we can never eliminate the potential causes of war—suspicion and fear.

	The people of our two countries understand the horrors and sufferings of war based on personal experience. They are deeply disgusted by the thought of future wars, and they know that future wars will be conducted with the most terrible weapons in human history. As leaders of the US and Soviet governments, our sacred duty is to seek all glorious ways to realize their common desire for peace. The peace in the hands of the people is the most reliable, and the best way for us to achieve this goal is to do everything in our power to put peace in the hands of the people.

	I believe that if we can make the Soviet people understand the peaceful purposes of the American people and government, there will be no war.

	I am sure that you are willing to publish the original text of the resolution passed by the United States Congress to the Soviet people.

		Harry Truman

	Resolution of the United States Congress

	McMahon-Rebikoff Joint Resolution (passed by the Senate on June 18, 1951, and by the House of Representatives on June 26, 1951) is as follows:

	Because the goal of the American people now and in the past has been just and lasting peace; and

	Because our deepest desire is to maintain human dignity together with all other countries, and to abide by the moral principles that alone make human existence meaningful; and

	Because the United States, in order to prove that it has this desire, has proposed sharing all the benefits of atomic energy, and in exchange, only requires guarantees to prevent the harms of the atom; and

	Because Congress reaffirms, as expressed in a law, that its policy is "to continue to do its utmost to reach agreements, to supply armed forces to the United Nations as stipulated in the Charter; and to reach agreements on the universal control of weapons of mass destruction, the universal restriction and reduction of armaments, including armed forces, and to provide adequate safeguards to protect countries that comply with control from being harmed by other countries that violate and evade control"; and

	Because the United States is also using its materials and resources to assist the people of all countries who are suffering from the ravages of war and poverty; and

	Because the terrible danger threatening the people of all free countries has forced the United States to implement a huge military spending program; and

	Because we are only reluctantly rearming and are willing to use our strength for the cause of peace: Therefore, the House of Representatives resolves (with the consent of the Senate): The United States Congress reaffirms the traditional and lasting friendship of the American people with the people of all other countries, and declares:

	The American people deeply regret the artificial barriers that separate them from the people of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which prevent the people of the Soviet Union from knowing that the American people are willing to live in friendship with the people of all other countries and jointly promote the ideal of human brotherhood;

	The American people believe that if the Soviet government eliminates these artificial barriers and allows free exchange of information between our two peoples, it will infinitely promote the cause of peace;

	The American people and their government neither want to go to war with the Soviet Union, nor do they want the terrible consequences of such a war;

	Although the American people are firmly determined to defend their freedom and security, they welcome all fair and just efforts to resolve the unresolved differences between the US and Soviet governments, and invite the people of the Soviet Union to cooperate in this effort in a friendly spirit;

	Congress requests the President of the United States to allow the government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to inform the people of the Soviet Union of the contents of this resolution.

	Shvernik's Reply to Truman's Letter

	The reply from the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Mr. Shvernik, to the American President Mr. Truman, is as follows:

	Your Excellency:

	I have the honor to inform you that your note of July 7, 1951, and the attached resolution of the United States Congress have been received, and I am now sending the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

	This resolution expresses the sincere and friendly feelings of the Soviet people towards the people of the world, and also talks about the unanimous desire of the Soviet people to establish lasting peace and eliminate the danger of new wars.

	The Soviet people have no doubt that the American people also do not want war. However, the Soviet people are well aware that in some countries, there are forces that are trying to start a new war, and some groups believe that war is their way to get rich.

	The Soviet people believe that if the people of all countries take the cause of defending peace into their own hands and defend it to the end, exposing the conspiracies of those forces who want war and are trying to drag the people into another war, then there will be no war.

	I agree with your opinion that most people yearn for peace and brotherly friendship from the bottom of their hearts. Therefore, those governments that are not paying lip service but are working to maintain peace with facts should use all means to encourage the peace aspirations of their people.

	The Soviet government is using all means to promote the efforts of the Soviet people who are fighting to defend peace, to unite with the efforts of the people of other countries. The Soviet government warmly receives peace envoys from any country, and uses all means to promote the exchanges between the Soviet people and the people of other countries, without creating any obstacles in this regard.

	There is no doubt that the harmony between countries mentioned in the letter must first of all develop political, economic and cultural relations and various ties between the people of all countries on an equal footing. The most important step on this path must be to eliminate any discrimination against the Soviet Union by the American authorities, which is also obvious.

	It is the responsibility of all peace-loving people to firmly pursue a policy of preventing war and maintaining peace, not to allow the expansion of armaments, to seek the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons and to establish supervision over the implementation of such a ban, and to promote the conclusion of a five-power pact to strengthen peace.

	The conclusion of such a pact is particularly important for improving Soviet-American relations and strengthening international peace. This pact can strengthen the confidence of the people of all countries that peace can be maintained, and at the same time, it provides the possibility of reducing armaments and easing the burden of military spending, all of which falls on the people of all countries. In realizing the above-mentioned measures, the American people will always have the full sympathy of the Soviet people, because the Soviet people are firmly defending the cause of peace.

	I hope that the full text of the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR can be published to the American people.

	I would like to take this opportunity to extend my respects and the blessings of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union to the American people.

		Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
		Nikolai Shvernik
		August 6, 1951, in Moscow

	Resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR

	The resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR is as follows:

	The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which manages the work of the two chambers—the Union Chamber and the National Chamber of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR—after studying the joint resolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America, which was sent with the letter of the American President Mr. Truman on July 7 this year, believes that it must declare as follows:

	(1) The Soviet government, representing the will of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union to defend peace, unswervingly pursues a policy of strengthening peace and establishing international friendly relations. This policy was established at the beginning of the establishment of the Soviet state, in the Peace Decree adopted by the Second Soviet Congress on November 8, 1917. Since then, the Soviet foreign policy has not changed, and its purpose is to strengthen peace and international friendly relations.

	After the Second World War, thanks to the joint efforts of the Allied countries, the forces of the aggressors were eliminated, the aggressive countries were disarmed, and international organizations were established to maintain peace and prevent the outbreak of new wars of aggression. This created conditions for the establishment of lasting peace. Everyone knows that the Soviet government has proactively proposed universal disarmament in strengthening international security, including banning the production of atomic energy and the use of atomic energy in war, and believes that this is the primary task. The Soviet government has consistently defended peace, expressing the unyielding determination of the people of all countries to prevent the danger of new wars. It has twice proposed that the United States, Britain, China, France, and the Soviet Union work together to maintain international peace and security, and conclude a peace pact. This initiative of the Soviet government has received enthusiastic support and approval from peace-loving people of all countries around the world. The Soviet people do not understand why the American government still refuses the Soviet government's proposal to conclude a five-power peace pact today, based on what peace-loving motives.

	After the outbreak of the Korean War and the open armed intervention of the United States in Korea, the Soviet government has repeatedly proposed peaceful solutions to the Korean conflict. Recently, the Soviet Union again proposed a proposal to stop the bloodshed in Korea, which has led to the armistice negotiations in Korea.

	The Soviet peace policy is fully and unconditionally supported by the people of all nationalities of the Soviet state. In the Soviet state, there is no class or group willing to start a war. The Soviet Union has no aggressive plans, and it does not threaten any country or any nation. The Soviet armed forces are not waging war anywhere, nor are they participating in any battles. The Soviet people are engaged in peaceful construction with all their strength. The Soviet state is building new large-scale hydroelectric power stations and irrigation systems, and is creating conditions for continuously improving the living standards of our people.

	(2) The resolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States says that the American people express deep regret for the existence of "artificial barriers" that separate them from the Soviet people.

	The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR must declare that the Soviet foreign policy does not hinder the harmony between the Soviet people and the American people and the people of other countries in any way, and it does not hinder the establishment of business, trade and friendly relations with these countries in any way.

	However, the foreign policy pursued by the power organs of North America is not like this. The American authorities have systematically refused to grant entry visas to Soviet cultural workers, and have even deported them despite the fact that they had previously obtained legal entry permits to the United States. In addition to these facts, several other discriminatory measures taken by the US government in its relations with the Soviet Union can also prove this. For example, the following facts can prove this.

	A. In December 1949, the US immigration authorities on the Virgin Islands issued an order without any reason prohibiting the sailors of the two Soviet fishing boats "Sea Mouse" and "Balamut" from landing in the port of Saint Thomas for minor repairs and watering.

	B. In July 1950, the US authorities in the port of Baltimore searched the Soviet ship "Krasnodar", and in violation of recognized international practices, police officers remained on the ship after the search until the ship departed.

	C. On March 18, 1948, the US authorities arbitrarily detained the Soviet ship "Russia" (which is the state property of the Soviet Union) after it entered the port of New York, based on the accusations of two passengers.

	D. In March 1949, the New York immigration authorities ordered the Soviet representatives who participated in the American Cultural and Scientific Community Peace Congress to leave the United States within a week, and threatened to take administrative measures against them if they did not comply with the order.

	E. In October 1950, two Soviet diplomatic couriers were detained at the Bloom Airport in New York, despite the fact that their passports had visas from the American diplomatic authorities.

	F. In March 1951, the US Department of Commerce issued an order abolishing export licenses for scientific and industrial publications to the Soviet Union.

	G. Recently, a group of hooligans gathered in front of the residence of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations, with the tacit approval of the police. They hindered the normal work of the delegation and threatened the personal safety of the delegation members. On August 2, the First Secretary of the delegation, Mr. Polyansky (who enjoys diplomatic privileges), was attacked by thugs in front of the police when he left the delegation's residence. They hit him on the head with sticks.

	H. On June 23 this year, the US government abolished the trade agreement signed between the Soviet Union and the United States in 1937. This was only a few days before the American President sent the resolution of the American Congress to the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Mr. Shvernik.

	I. On June 2 this year, the US Congress passed a law requiring countries that accept so-called American economic and financial assistance to virtually sever trade relations with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, otherwise this assistance will be stopped.

	On June 7 this year, the list of embargoed items announced according to this law included almost all commodities that circulate in international trade.

	J. On August 2, already after the American Congress sent a letter to the Soviet Supreme Soviet, the House of Representatives passed a new law stipulating several measures under the pretext of preventing the transportation of strategic materials, the purpose of which is to stop trade with the Soviet Union and countries friendly to the Soviet Union.

	The above-mentioned discriminatory measures in trade have caused the fact that in the five years since 1946, Soviet-American trade has fallen by more than five-sixths, to a negligible level.

	All these facts prove that the American power organs have adopted a discriminatory policy towards the Soviet Union and erected artificial barriers to prevent free contact between the Soviet Union and the American people, separating our two countries.

	Here, a legitimate question arises: How can the above-mentioned actions of the American authorities be in line with the statement in the resolution of the American Congress about the need to eliminate barriers between the people of the two countries?

	The Soviet people do not doubt that the American people, like all other people, do not want war. However, as history has shown, the issue of war and peace is not always decided by the people. The speeches of many responsible representatives of the American government and members of the American Congress contain direct demands for launching a war of aggression against the Soviet people and using weapons of mass murder against peaceful residents.

	Such remarks not only violate the interests of peace, but also violate the basic requirements of human morality, which the American Congress should have condemned.

	(3) The American government has come forward to initiate the North Atlantic military alliance, which is obviously aimed at the Soviet Union. It has established a vast network of military bases in foreign territories adjacent to the Soviet border, and has rearmed West Germany and restored Japanese militarism in violation of its obligations. At the same time, huge armaments plans are being implemented in the United States.

	The American government has consistently refused all proposals made by the Soviet government to strengthen peace and international security. Therefore, until now, no agreement has been reached on the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, on the prohibition of atomic weapons, and on the establishment of a control organization to supervise the implementation of this ban, and on the reduction of armaments and troops. The US Congressional resolution also states that the path is now open to using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. But there is no doubt that only after atomic weapons are banned can atomic energy truly be used for peaceful purposes to benefit the people of all countries.

	The Soviet people are increasingly convinced that the policies and actions of the American government are contrary to its verbal declarations about maintaining peace, and are also contrary to the peace-loving wishes of the American people, and are creating conditions for further deterioration of Soviet-American relations, even though the United States has not been threatened by the Soviet Union in the past, nor is it now.

	(4) Of course, anyone would welcome the letter from the American Congress to the Soviet people and the call for strengthening friendly relations between the US and the Soviet Union. However, it is useless to merely call for improving relations between the Soviet Union and the United States in words. Only when the actions of the American government, the policies and actions of the American government are not contrary to this proposition can positive results be produced.

	However, since the American Congress has declared that it is seeking to improve relations with the Soviet Union, there is no doubt that this intention is in line with the peace-loving wishes of the Soviet people and the Soviet Union's peace policy.

	The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet believes that the most solemn step in this issue should be to eliminate discrimination against the Soviet Union in all aspects of international relations, which has always hindered the normal relations between our two countries.

	A more important step in improving relations between our two countries and strengthening peace between the people of all countries is the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, and other countries committed to strengthening peace can also participate.

	The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is convinced that the conclusion of this pact will be welcomed with great satisfaction by all people who are willing to maintain peace.

	The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet hopes that the American Congress will make this resolution public to the American people.

　　什维尔尼克答复杜鲁门来信
    苏联再度建议缔结五大国和平公约
    苏最高苏维埃主席团通过决议案，表示苏联人民为世界持久和平而奋斗的决心，并揭露美国政府违反和平的措施。
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日电：美国总统杜鲁门和苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克往来的信件。
    今年七月七日，苏联外交部接到美国大使寇克先生的一份备忘录，要求把美国总统杜鲁门先生的信件和美利坚合众国国会的一项决议案转交苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克。
    八月六日，苏联最高苏维埃主席团通过了一项决议案，苏联驻华盛顿大使馆在同日把这项决议案连同苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克的复信，一并送交美国国务院，并要求转给美国总统。
    下面是美国总统杜鲁门先生的信件和美国国会的决议案，以及苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克对这封信的复信，和苏联最高苏维埃主席团八月六日的决议案。
            杜鲁门的信件
    杜鲁门总统的信件如下：阁下：
    我很荣幸地把美国国会通过的一项决议案转交给你，并请求你的政府向苏联人民公布这项决议案的内容。
    这项决议案表达了美国人民对全世界一切人民的友谊和善意，决议案并重新强调美国政府深愿尽其所能以实现公正与持久的和平。
    我，作为美国的元首，对这项决议案表示诚恳的赞同。我附上我自己给苏联人民的信，恳切希望这些表示可以促进对于美国的目的和目标的更好的了解。
    过去几年中的不愉快的结果说明：当存在着妨碍各国人民间友好地交换意见和讯息的障壁的时候，国际间正式的外交谈判就会大大受到妨碍。一个和平世界的最大希望在于每个人心灵深处的对和平的渴望与兄弟友爱。但是，得不到正常通讯工具的人民，会无法达到相互了解的，而这种了解是信任和友谊的必要的基础。在允许自由公开地越过国际边界交流讯息以前，我们永远不能消除引起战争的潜在原因——猜疑和恐惧。
    我们两国的人民根据亲身的经验，了解战争的惨状和痛苦。他们想到未来的战争就深恶痛绝，他们知道未来的战争是以人类历史上最可怕的武器来进行的。作为美苏两国政府的领袖，我们的神圣职责是寻求一切光荣的方法，实现他们对和平的共同渴望。掌握在人民手中的和平是最可靠的，我们达到这个目标的最好方法，就是尽我们的一切力量把和平放在人民手中。
    我相信，如果我们可以使苏联人民了解美国人民和政府的和平目的，就不会有战争。
    我确信你是愿意把美国国会通过的决议案原文公之于苏联人民的。
        哈利·杜鲁门
    美国国会的决议案
    麦克马洪—芮比科夫联合决议案（一九五一年六月十八日参院通过，一九五一年六月二十六日众院通过）如下：
    由于美国人民的目标现在和以往都是公正和持久的和平；并且
    由于我国最深切的愿望是与一切其他国家共同保持人的尊严，而遵守唯一使人的生存具有意义的那些道义原则；并且
    由于美国为了证明它有这个愿望起见，已建议分享原子能的一切好处，而作为交换条件，只要求保证防止原子的害处；并且
    由于国会重申，正如在一项法律中所表示的，它的政策是“继续尽最大努力以取得协议，照宪章规定将武装部队供给联合国；并取得协议，普遍管制大规模杀人的武器，普遍限制与裁减军备，包括武装部队在内，并规定充分的保障办法以保护遵守管制的国家不因他国违反和规避管制而受损害”；并且
    由于美国同样用它的物资和资源来援助那些受战争蹂躏和贫困的痛苦的各国人民；并且
    由于威胁一切自由国家人民的可怖危险迫使美国实行庞大的军备费用计划；并且
    由于我们只是勉强地重整军备，且愿意以我们的力量从事和平事业：因此，众院兹决议（参院同意）：美国国会重申美国人民对一切其他国家人民的传统和永久的友谊，并宣布：
    美国人民对于把他们和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟各族人民分开的人为障壁深感遗憾，这个障壁使苏联各族人民不能知道美国人民愿与一切其他国家人民友好相处，并与它们共同促进人类皆兄弟的理想；
    美国人民认为：苏联政府如果消除这些人为的障壁，使我们两国人民间能自由交换讯息，就可以无限地促进和平事业；
    美国人民和他们的政府既不希望与苏联开战，更不希望得到这样一个战争的可怖后果；
    美国人民虽然坚定地决心保卫他们的自由和安全，但欢迎一切光明正大的、解决美苏政府间没有解决的分歧的努力，并邀请苏联各族人民以友好的精神在这个努力中合作；
    国会要求美国总统请苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府让苏联各族人民了解这个决议案的内容。
            什维尔尼克复杜鲁门的信
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克回答美国总统杜鲁门先生的复信如下：阁下：
    我很荣幸地通知你，你一九五一年七月七日的照会及附寄美国国会的决议案已经收到了，今特将苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主席团的决议案寄去。
    这个决议案表达了苏联人民对全世界人民的真挚友好的情感，同时谈到苏联人民一致愿望确立持久和平，消除新战争的危险。
    苏联人民毫不怀疑美国人民也是不要战争的。然而，苏联人民很清楚地知道，在某些国家，有一些势力力图发动新战争，某些集团认为战争是他们的致富之道。
    苏联人民认为：如果各国人民把拥护和平的事业掌握在自己手里，并且保卫到底，揭露那些想要战争并力图把人民拖进另一次战争的势力的阴谋，那么就不会有战争。
    你说大多数人民从内心深处渴望和平与兄弟般的友好，这个意见我很同意。因此，那些不是空谈而是以事实来努力维护和平的政府，便应该用一切办法，鼓励他们人民的和平意愿。
    苏联政府用一切办法促使正在为保卫和平而斗争的苏联人民的努力，与其他各国人民的努力联合起来。苏联政府殷勤地接待任何国家的和平使节，并用一切办法促进苏联人民和其他国家人民的交往，而不在这方面加以任何阻碍。
    毫无疑问，来函中所谈到的各国间的和睦，首先须要在平等基础上发展各国人民间的政治、经济和文化关系及各种联系。在这一道路上最重要的步骤，必须是消除美国当局对苏联的任何歧视，这一点也是明显的。
    坚定地奉行阻止战争与维护和平的政策，不容许进行扩张军备，求得裁减军备和禁止原子武器并建立对实施这种禁令的监督，促进缔结五大国公约以加强和平，这是全体爱好和平的人民的职责。
    缔结这样的公约对改善苏美关系和加强国际和平是特别重要的。这种公约可以加强各国人民的信心，相信和平可以维持，同时它提供了裁减军备、减轻军费负担的可能性，全部军费负担都是落在各国人民身上的。在实现上述措施中，美国人民会始终得到苏联人民的完全同情，因为苏联人民是坚定地保卫和平事业的。
    我希望苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议案全文能向美国人民公布。
    我谨借此机会请求阁下向美国人民转致我的敬意和苏联各族人民的祝福。
                苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主
            席团主席尼可拉·什维尔尼克
                        一九五一年八月六日于莫斯科
            苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议案
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议案如下：
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟综理两院——苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院——工作的最高苏维埃主席团，在研究了今年七月七日随同美国总统杜鲁门先生的信发来的美利坚合众国参议院及众议院联合决议案后，认为必须声明如下：
    （一）苏联政府代表苏联各族人民保卫和平的意志，坚定不移地推行加强和平与建立国际友好关系的政策。在苏维埃国家创立之初，在一九一七年十一月八日第二次苏维埃代表大会通过的和平法令中，这种政策便已奠定。自那时起，苏联的外交政策便一直没有改变，其目的在加强和平和国际友好关系。
    在第二次世界大战以后，由于盟国的共同努力，肃清了侵略者的势力，解除了侵略国家的武装，并建立了国际组织来维护和平和防止新侵略战争的爆发，这就创造了建立持久和平的条件。大家知道，苏联政府曾在加强国际安全方面主动建议普遍裁减军备，包括禁止生产原子能和使用原子能于战争，并认为这是首要的任务。苏联政府坚持不渝地保卫和平，表达各国人民防止新战争危险的不屈不挠的决心，它曾两度建议：美国、英国、中国、法国和苏联共同努力，维护国际和平与安全，并缔结和平公约。苏联政府的这一倡议受到全世界爱好和平的各国人民的热烈支持和赞同。苏联人民不了解美国政府到今天基于什么爱好和平的动机，仍拒绝苏联政府要求缔结五大国和平公约的建议。
    在朝鲜战争爆发、美国公开武装干涉朝鲜以后，苏联政府曾再三提出和平解决朝鲜冲突的建议。最近苏联又提出停止朝鲜流血惨剧的建议，这一建议已导致了朝鲜停火停战谈判。
    苏联的和平政策是得到苏维埃国家各族人民的完全和无条件的支持的，在苏维埃国家，没有任何阶级或集团愿意发动战争。苏联没有任何侵略计划，它并没有威胁任何国家或任何民族。苏联的武装部队并不在什么地方进行战争，并且也不在参加什么战事。苏联人民以全力从事于和平建设的工作。苏维埃国家正在进行新的巨大的水力发电站和灌溉系统的建设，并且正为不断地进一步提高我国人民的生活水平创造条件。
    （二）美国参议院和众议院的决议说：美国人民对于把他们与苏联人民隔开的“人工障壁”的存在，表示深切的遗憾。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团必须声明：苏联的外交政策对于苏联人民和美国人民以及其他各国人民的和睦方面，并没有加以任何阻碍，并且对于在和这些国家建立商务、贸易与友好关系方面，也没有加以任何阻碍。
    但是，北美合众国的权力机关所奉行的外交政策就不是这样。美国当局曾有计划地拒绝给予苏联文化工作者以入境签证，并且甚至不顾他们以前已经得到美国的合法入境许可，后来又把他们驱逐出去。除了这些事实之外，美国政府在对苏关系上的若干其他歧视措施也可以证实这一点。例如下面的一些事实就可以证实这一点。
    甲，一九四九年十二月，维尔京群岛上的美国移民当局毫无理由地发布命令，禁止进入圣托马斯港进行小修和添水的两条苏联渔船“海鼠号”和“巴尔拉幕特号”的水手登岸。
    乙，一九五○年七月，巴尔的摩港的美国当局搜查苏联船“克拉斯诺达”号，并且违背了公认的国际惯例，警察人员在搜查后仍然留在船上直至该船启程离去时为止。
    丙，一九四八年三月十八日，美国当局在苏联船“俄罗斯号”（该船是苏联的国家财产）进入纽约港后，以两个旅客的控诉为由专横地将该船扣押。
    丁，一九四九年三月，纽约移民当局命令参加美国文化与科学界保卫和平代表大会的苏联代表于一星期之内离开美国，并威胁他们如果不履行该命令的话，将对他们采取行政措施。
    戊，一九五○年十月，苏联的两个外交信使被扣留在纽约勃鲁姆飞机场，尽管他们的护照已有美国外交机关的签证。
    己，一九五一年三月，美国商务部发布命令，废止科学——工业方面印刷品运往苏联的出口许可证。
    庚，最近，在苏联驻联合国代表团住所前面，在警察的默许下聚集了一群流氓，他们妨害了代表团的正常工作，并且威胁代表团人员的人身安全。八月二日，代表团一等秘书波良斯基（他是享有外交官特权的）在离开代表团住所时，就当着警察的面前受到了暴徒们的袭击，他们用棍子打他的头。
    辛，今年六月二十三日，美国政府废弃了苏联和美国在一九三七年所签订的贸易协定，这只是在美国总统将美国国会的决议送交苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克的几天以前的事情。
    壬，今年六月二日，美国国会通过一项法律，要求凡接受所谓美国经济与财政援助的国家，在实际上断绝与苏联及各人民民主国家的贸易关系，否则停止这种援助。
    今年六月七日，根据这个法律公布的禁运品项目表，几乎包括了在国际贸易中销行的一切商品。
    癸，八月二日，已经是在美国国会致函苏联最高苏维埃之后，众议院通过了一项新法律，在防止运输战略原料的借口下规定了若干措施，其目的在于制止对苏联及与苏联友好的国家的贸易。
    上述贸易方面的歧视措施已经造成这样的事实，即在一九四六年以来的五年当中，苏美间的贸易已经跌落六分之五以上，小到微不足道的水平。
    所有这些事实都证明：美国权力机关对苏联采取了歧视政策，并树立人为的障壁，阻止苏联与美国人民自由交际，把我们两国隔离开来。
    这里就发生了正当的疑问：美国当局的上述行动，怎么能与美国国会决议中关于必须消除两国人民间的障壁的声明相符呢？
    苏联人民不怀疑美国人民和其他一切人民一样不要战争。然而，像历史所说明的，战争与和平的问题并不永远是由人民决定的。许多美国政府负责代表和美国国会议员的言论中，包含有直接要求对苏联人民发动侵略战争、使用大规模屠杀和平居民的武器的主张。
    这种言论不仅违反和平的利益，而且违反人类道德的基本要求，美国国会是本来应该加以斥责的。
    （三）美国政府曾出面发起显然是对付苏联的北大西洋军事联盟。它在邻近苏联边境的外国领土内建立广大的军事基地网，并违背其所担承的义务而重新武装西德，恢复日本的军国主义。同时在美国国内，也正在实行庞大的军备计划。
    美国政府始终拒绝苏联政府所提出的加强和平和国际安全的一切建议。因此，直到现在，关于缔结五大国和平公约、关于禁止原子武器和关于建立管制机构监督这一禁令的执行、以及关于裁减军备与军队，都没有达成协议。美国国会决议并表示：现在把原子能用于和平用途的路是开着的。但毫无疑问，只有在禁止了原子武器以后，原子能才能真正用于和平用途，为各国人民谋福利。
    苏联人民日益相信，美国政府的政策和行为是违反它关于维护和平的口头宣言的，同样也是违反美国人民爱好和平的愿望的，而且正在制造使对苏关系更加恶化的条件，尽管美国在过去没有，现在也没有受到苏联方面任何危险的威胁。
    （四）当然，对美国国会的致苏联人民书和关于加强美苏两国友好关系的呼吁，谁都是表示欢迎的。可是，仅仅口头上呼吁改善苏美两国间的关系是没有用处的，只有美国政府的行为、美国政府的政策和行动不和这种主张背道而驰，那才能产生积极的结果。
    然而，美国国会既已声言，它正在设法改善对苏关系，那便无可怀疑它这种意愿是符合苏联人民爱好和平的意愿和苏联的和平政策的。
    最高苏维埃主席团认为，在这个问题上，最郑重的一步，应该是在国际关系的一切方面消除对苏联的歧视，这种歧视一向妨碍着我们两国间的正常关系。
    在改善我们两国关系及加强各国人民间的和平这一问题上，更为重要的步骤是五大国缔结和平公约，其他致力于加强和平的国家也可以参加。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主席团确信，一切愿意维护和平的人民会以极大的满意欢迎这个公约的缔结。
    最高苏维埃主席团希望美国国会能将本决议案公诸美国人民之前。
                        一九五一年八月六日
