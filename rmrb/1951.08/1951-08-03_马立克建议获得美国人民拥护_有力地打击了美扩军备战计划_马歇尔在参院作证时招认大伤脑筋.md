Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: U.S. Defense Secretary Marshall admitted that Soviet UN representative Malik's proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War has had a tremendous impact among the American people, powerfully打击美帝国主义者的扩军备战计划 (hit the U.S. imperialists' expansion and war preparations plans).

Marshall testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July 27 in support of Truman's $8.5 billion so-called "foreign aid" plan. In appealing to senators to support this war preparation plan, Marshall frankly told them that the American people wanted peace and did not want to prepare for war. This has caused the U.S. government a great headache. He said that Malik's proposal "has very seriously affected our defense plans." Marshall expressed "shock" saying: "I cannot imagine that the American people would have such a reaction to a statement from the Soviet Union."

Marshall then just as frankly demonstrated to the senators that the real purpose of the so-called "foreign aid" plan was to use other countries to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States, and to make the youth of Western European countries "allied" with the United States cannon fodder for American aggressive wars. He explained the beauty of this plan: "We spend money to arm soldiers of other countries, rather than arm our own soldiers; we would rather spend money than send troops."

After making the above statement, Marshall apparently realized that he had spoken too frankly, so he hurriedly tried to retract his statement. It is reported that Marshall has requested that his "inadvertent" words be deleted from the stenographic record of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. At the same time, Committee Chairman Connally has requested that newspaper reporters not quote Marshall's words in newspapers.

　　马立克建议获得美国人民拥护
    有力地打击了美扩军备战计划
    马歇尔在参院作证时招认大伤脑筋
    【新华社二日讯】美国国防部长马歇尔承认苏联驻联合国代表马立克关于和平解决朝鲜战争的建议在美国人民中间发生了极大的影响，有力地打击了美帝国主义者的扩军备战计划。
    马歇尔七月二十七日在参院外交委员会作证支持杜鲁门的八十五亿美元的所谓“援外”计划。在呼吁参议员们支持这个备战计划时，马歇尔坦率地告诉他们，美国人民愿意和平而不愿意准备战争。这已使美国政府大伤脑筋。他说：马立克的建议“已非常严重地影响了我国的防务计划”。马歇尔表示“震惊”说：“美国人民对苏联的一个声明竟有这种反应，这是我所不能想象的。”
    接着马歇尔同样坦率地向参议员们证明所谓“援外”计划的真正目的是在于利用别的国家为美国火中取栗，使与美国“联盟”的西欧各国的青年充当美国侵略战争的炮灰。他说明这个计划的妙处是：“我们花钱武装其他国家的士兵，而不是武装我们自己的士兵，我们宁出钱不出兵。”
    马歇尔在发表了上述声明之后，显然发觉自己说得过于露骨，因此急忙设法收回他的声明。据悉，马歇尔已要求把他的“不慎”的字句从参院外委会的速记记录中删去，同时，外委会主席康纳利已要求各报记者不要在报纸上引用马歇尔说的这些话。
