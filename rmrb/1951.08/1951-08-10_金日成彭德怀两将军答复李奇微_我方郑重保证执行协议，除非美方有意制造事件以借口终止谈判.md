Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th – General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, today sent a reply to General Ridgway's letter of August 7th. The full text of the reply is as follows:

"General Ridgway:

We have received your letter of August 7th. In our reply to you on August 6th, we told you: 'We have again ordered our guards in the Kaesong Neutral Zone to strictly abide by the agreement of July 14th and guarantee that no more violations of the agreement will occur.' You must know that this agreement is the agreement on the neutralization of the Kaesong area that you mentioned in your letter of August 7th. Since we have solemnly guaranteed strict implementation of the agreement on the neutralization of the Kaesong area, it is impossible for us to imagine that there will still be situations in the future where the agreement cannot be fulfilled on our side, unless your side intentionally creates incidents as an excuse to terminate the armistice negotiations. As for our side, even if your side has similar incidents, we will never rashly terminate the negotiations without going through procedures such as protests, investigations, and consultations to resolve them. We still hope that you will order your representatives to come to Kaesong for a meeting.

        Korean People's Army Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung
    Chinese People's Volunteers Commander Peng Dehuai"

Ridgway's letter of August 7th is as follows:

"General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai:

"I have received and seen the contents of your telegram of August 6th. You say that you have again ordered your guards in the Kaesong area to strictly abide by the regulations that armed guards are not allowed to enter the meeting area, so that incidents like that of August 4th will not happen again.

"I have also noticed that you describe such incidents as accidental and minor matters. I have pointed out before that such incidents are of fundamental importance. These incidents are neither small incidents nor minor matters. The accidental nature of these incidents is questionable, because those mortar and machine gun teams violated your established agreement by appearing in the neutral zone with their equipment, while the only armed forces in the neutral zone should have been those needed to perform the duties of military police.

"It must be clearly understood that my acceptance of the resumption of armistice negotiations is conditional upon your full compliance with your guarantees of the neutralization of the Kaesong area. Any further violations in this regard will be considered a deliberate act by your side to terminate the armistice negotiations.

"I await your acceptance of this condition.

  Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, General of the Army, James A. Van Fleet (Note: This should actually say Matthew Ridgway)"

　　金日成彭德怀两将军答复李奇微
    我方郑重保证执行协议，除非美方有意制造事件以借口终止谈判
    【新华社平壤九日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，本日对李奇微将军八月七日的来信发出了答复。复信全文如下：“李奇微将军：
    你八月七日的来信收到了。我们在八月六日给你的答复，曾经告你：‘我们已再度命令开城中立区的我方警卫部队严格遵守七月十四日的协议并保证不再发生违反协议的事件’。你必定知道这个协议就是你八月七日来信中所说的关于开城区中立化的协议。我们既已郑重保证对开城区中立化的协议严格执行，就不可能设想在我们方面将来仍有不能履行协议的情况发生，除非你方有意制造事件作为终止停战谈判的借口。至于我们方面，即使你方发生类似事件，我们也绝不会不经过抗议调查协商解决等手续，便率尔终止谈判的。我们仍继续希望你命令你的代表前来开城开会。
        朝鲜人民军最高司令官  金日成
    中国志愿军司令员  彭德怀”
    按李奇微八月七日来信如下：“金日成将军和彭德怀将军：
    “我已接到和看到你们八月六日来电的内容。你们说已再度命令你方开城区的警卫部队严格遵守武装警卫部队不得进入会址区的规定，以使八月四日这类事件不再发生。
    “我也已注意到，你们把这类事件说成是偶然的枝节小事。我从前曾经指出，这类事件是具有根本重要意义的。这类事件既不是小事件也不是枝节事件。这类事件的偶然性质是可以怀疑的，因为那些迫击炮和机枪队是违反你们所订立的协定，带着他们的装备出现在中立区，而中立区的唯一武装部队原应是为执行宪兵职务所需的部队。
    “必须清楚地了解，我接受恢复停战谈判，是以你们完全遵守你们所作的开城地区中立化的保证为条件的。在这一点上再发生任何违反的事件，都将被认为是你方故意终止停战谈判的举动。
    “我等待你们接受这个条件。
  联合国军总司令美国陆军上将李奇微”
