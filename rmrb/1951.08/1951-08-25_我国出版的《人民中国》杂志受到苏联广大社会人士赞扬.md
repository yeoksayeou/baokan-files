Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 23rd. The Soviet newspaper Pravda published an article on the 22nd by Kovalev, entitled "People's China," introducing the "People's China" magazine published by the Foreign Languages Press in our country, and citing materials to introduce the outstanding achievements of New China in industry, agriculture, foreign trade, culture, and diplomacy. Kovalev wrote in the diplomacy section: "The eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is an indestructible force, and this force is striking at the arrogant plans of the instigators of a new war." Kovalev emphasized that the materials published in "People's China" magazine show that the economy and culture of the young People's Republic of China are on the rise. Broad prospects for building a new life have unfolded before the Chinese working people. The attempts of American and British aggressors to use spies, bandits, and secret agents to undermine China's democratic construction are bound to fail. Kovalev pointed out that every issue of "People's China" has been praised by broad sections of Soviet society. The life and struggle of the Chinese people introduced in this magazine helps to further consolidate the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union.
