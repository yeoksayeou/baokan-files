Xinhua News Agency, 19th: London "Daily Worker" reporter Alan Winnington reported from Kaesong on the 17th: During the subcommittee meetings, everyone in Kaesong waited to see if the Americans would withdraw their territorial demands or merely try to play new propaganda tricks. The remaining people of Kaesong went about their business amidst the rubble of bombings. After the brutal American bombings, there were only hills and streams—no military targets left except for a few schools and a hotel. Regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, this will forever be a famous city—the place where a super-mechanized imperialism was forced to negotiate with the free people of Asia on equal terms for the first time. This is historically significant, so fresh and shocking that the Americans, still pitifully obsessed with the power of dollars, corruption, and machines, cannot fully grasp it.

	The formal meeting is a microcosm of the world. The "United Nations" delegation is naturally all American—with only one South Korean sycophant representing Syngman Rhee. They say to the journalists: "Hey, guys!" They stride in with an air of arrogance and nervousness. They are doing the impossible: trying to use the brute force of their air force to demand large swathes of North Korean territory, even though they know they are forced to negotiate due to their irremediable weaknesses, especially in manpower and morale. Opposite them are the people who truly live in Korea and China, Koreans and Chinese patiently explaining that returning to the 38th parallel to solve the problem is both fair and in line with military reality, and patiently saying that they are willing to reasonably adjust the demilitarized zone to suit both sides. They are not bluffing. They are supported by 500 million people determined never to be ruled by imperialism again.

	Outside the meeting room, American soldiers can meet Korean and Chinese fighters. I overheard a Chinese People's Volunteer soldier speaking in English to an American soldier, "I came here because you crossed the 38th parallel. As long as you occupy the north side of the 38th parallel, I will not return home." The American soldier said, "I never wanted to cross the 38th parallel, and neither did my brothers. Crossing the 38th parallel was wrong. We want to go home just like you." These are the real Americans, unlike the Americans who make up the majority of the "United Nations" reporters, who appear outwardly arrogant and confident, but are actually slaves to the news censors' blue pencils. Fawning over them are one or two Kuomintang and South Korean "reporters" who try to conceal their identities as spies, but fail. They photograph everyone and take secretive notes. The British I saw all refused to wear UN badges, but there were very few British present. In the past week, the Reuters representative was a "reliable German" and an American. Both wore UN badges. Only the British "Daily Worker" regularly receives real news from its own correspondent stationed here.

	The American journalists exhibit a cartoonish intellect, classically explaining great events to the world. An American journalist secretly asked me, "What makes the Chinese fight so well? They carry small bags of white stuff. Is it some kind of courage drug they eat before fighting?" The mysterious small bags contain a chemical called sodium chloride—common table salt. These people from 5,000 miles away cannot understand that people are heroic when defending their homeland. These journalists are the main tools used by the United States to make the "big lie" policy a success, a policy that even Dr. Goebbels would admire.

	When the meeting began to discuss the demarcation line, the Americans immediately made a demand so absurd that they dared not make it public to the world. This demand was that Korea and China should withdraw from 12,000 square kilometers of territory, so that the Americans could gain new points of attack without firing a shot. But they told reporters that Joy was demanding that the demarcation line be established along the current battle line, spreading this lie with all sorts of gibberish until the first meeting of the subcommittee. Here in Kaesong, the matter has become so notorious that American press officer Nacos has a struggle every night. But so far, the censor's pencil has prevailed, and only the Chinese and Korean reporters, my Australian colleague Wilfred Burchett, and myself have sent out the real news.

	It is this shameless American deception of the whole world that has caused the deadlock. That is why General Nam Il repeatedly said to Joy: "Don't deceive the world. Tell the world what you told me! You don't have the face to say your demands publicly." All their tricks have been exposed one by one, and now they only have to face military reality and historical facts, one of which, as General Nam Il pointed out, is that the days when a few gunboats could occupy an Eastern country are gone forever.

	Now, the Americans have proposed setting up a subcommittee, saying they are trying to break the long-term deadlock. Is this a new trick, or are the Americans—whose scare tactics have been seen through by the steely-nerved Chinese and North Koreans—looking for a face-saving way to step down? They will find that General Nam Il is perfectly amenable to agreeing to a demilitarized zone that is suitable for both sides, but he will resolutely oppose setting the demilitarized zone within the positions of the Chinese and Korean armies north of the 38th parallel. His attitude is based on military reality, justice, and the firm support of the Chinese and Korean people and all honest people in all countries who hope for a peaceful resolution of this dangerous Far Eastern situation.

　　英《工人日报》记者自开城报道
    美方无耻欺骗全世界  一切诡计已全被识破
    【新华社十九日讯】伦敦《工人日报》记者阿兰·魏宁顿十七日自开城报道：在小组委员会开会的时候，开城的每一个人都等着看一看，美国人是撤消他们的领土要求呢？还是仅仅想玩弄新的宣传手段呢？开城剩下的人民在被轰炸成的一片瓦砾中，办理他们自己的事情。这里经美国的残暴轰炸后，有的是山岗、溪流——除几个学校和一家酒店外，再没有军事目标了。不论谈判的结果如何，这里将永远是一个有名的城市——超级机械化的帝国主义被迫第一次在平等条件下和亚洲的自由人民进行谈判的地方。这是有历史意义的，这种意义是这样的新鲜，这样使人震惊，因此美国人，由于他们仍然可怜地迷信美元、腐化和机器的力量，还不能充分认识这一点。
    正式会议正是世界的缩影。“联合国”的代表团自然全是美国人——只有一个是代表李承晚的应声虫。他们对新闻记者说：“喂，伙计们！”他们大踏步走进来，带着既妄自尊大而又神经紧张的神气。他们作的是件办不到的事情，这就是企图用他们的空军的暴行力量，来索取北朝鲜的大块领土，虽然他们知道他们是由于他们的无可补救的弱点特别是人力和士气方面的弱点而被迫进行谈判的。他们的对面是在朝鲜和中国真正生活着的人们，朝鲜人和中国人耐心地说明回到三八线来解决问题的办法既公平而又符合军事现实，并且耐心地说，他们愿意合理地调整非军事区域以合乎双方的心意。他们并不是虚张声势。他们背后有决心永不再受帝国主义统治的五亿人民支持他们。
    在会议室外，美国士兵可以与朝鲜和中国战士会面。我无意中听到一位操英语的志愿军战士向一名美国士兵说，“我到这里来是因为你们越过了三八线，只要你们占着三八线的北边，我就不回国。”这位美国士兵说，“我从未想要越过三八线，我的弟兄们也从未这样想。越过三八线是错误的。我们像你一样想要回国。”这是真正的美国人，不像那些占“联合国”记者大多数的美国人，这些美国人表面上趾高气扬、很有自信的样子，但实际是新闻检查官蓝铅笔下的奴隶。阿谀他们的是一两个国民党和南朝鲜“记者”，他们企图掩藏他们特务的身份，但未成功，他们拍摄每一个人的照片，作诡密的笔记。我所看到的英国人都拒绝戴联合国徽章，但出现的英国人很少。在过去一周，英国路透社的代表是一个“可靠的德国人”和一个美国人。这两个人都戴联合国徽章。英国只有工人日报每天经常自该报自己驻此间的记者获得真实消息。
    美国记者表现了一种漫画栏式的智力，这种智力正古典地向世界解释大事。美国记者偷偷问我说，“什么东西使中国人打得这样好呢？他们带着小袋的白东西。这是不是打仗前要吃的一种勇气药呢？”神秘的小袋装有称为氯化钠的化学品——普通食盐。来自五千英里外美国的这些人，不能了解各国人民在保卫他们的家乡时是英勇的。这些记者是被美国利用的主要工具，以使“漫天大谎”的政策获得成功，这个政策使戈培尔博士自叹莫如。
    在会议开始讨论分界线时，美国人马上提出了一个要求，这个要求荒谬绝伦到如此程度，以至于他们不敢向世界公布它，这个要求是：朝鲜和中国应自一万二千方公里的领土上撤退，这样美国人就可以不打一枪而获得新的进攻点。但他们告记者说，乔埃要求沿目前战线建立分界线，他们以各种各样的混言乱语使这个谎言流传着，一直到小组委员会开第一次会议时为止。在开城这里，这件事已变得这样丑名四扬，以至于美国新闻发布官纳科斯每天晚上都有一场斗争。但迄今为止，新闻检查官的铅笔是胜利了，只有中国和朝鲜的记者，我的澳大利亚籍同事贝却敌和我自己，向外发出了真实的消息。
    美国这种无耻地欺骗全世界的手段造成了僵局，就是为了这个缘故。南日将军才再三向乔埃说：“不要欺骗世界了。把你告诉我的话告诉全世界罢！你没有脸公开说出你的要求。”他们所有的诡计都一个一个地被识破了，现在他们只有面对军事现实和历史事实了，这些事实之一就是，如南日将军所指出的：几只炮舰就可以攻占一个东方国家的日子已经一去不复返了。
    现在，美国人已经建议设立小组委员会，说是设法打破长期的僵局。这是新的诡计呢，还是美国人——他们的恫吓手段都被神经坚强的中国人和北朝鲜人识破了——要找一个留面子的办法下台呢？他们将发现：在同意一个对双方都适合的非军事区方面，南日将军是完全可以通融的，但是他将坚决反对把非军事区设在三八线以北的朝中军队的阵地内。他这种态度的基础是军事现实、正义和朝中人民及一切希望和平解决这种危险的远东局势的各国正直人民的坚决支持。
