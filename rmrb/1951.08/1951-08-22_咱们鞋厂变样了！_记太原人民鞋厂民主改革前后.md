　　"Our Shoe Factory Has Changed!"
     ——A Record of the Democratic Reform Before and After the Taiyuan People's Shoe Factory
      Duan Lian
    Editor's Note: This article illustrates the necessity of implementing democratic reforms; it also demonstrates that while democratic reforms have generally been carried out in factories and mines in North China, it cannot be said that all factories and mines have carried them out, or that they have all been carried out thoroughly. Therefore, all industrial and mining enterprises that have not undergone democratic reforms or have not undergone them thoroughly should make up for this lesson.
          The successful completion of the democratic reform in the Taiyuan People's Shoe Factory has universally boosted the production enthusiasm of the workers. Everyone says, "Our shoe factory has changed." This statement reflects that the workers are truly in charge of the factory. Taiyuan has been liberated for more than two years, why are the workers only saying this now? Let's recall the People's Shoe Factory over the past two years since liberation:

  Before Democratic Reform, Feudal Tyrants Obstructed Production
    Before liberation, this shoe factory originally belonged to the military industrial production system of Yan Xishan's bandit army. After liberation, the factory's leading cadres lacked a clear understanding of the idea of relying on the working class to improve the enterprise, and one-sidedly believed that implementing democratic reform would "affect production." Without analysis, they believed that "uniting a technician is worth ten workers." Therefore, the factory did not appropriately handle those feudal tyrants and special agents such as Guo Chengduo, Meng Zongshun, and Zheng Jinzhang who had cruelly persecuted workers in the past. These bad elements actually remained in key positions such as section chiefs and directors, and the leading cadres were surrounded by their feudal practices of "treating guests" and "giving gifts." Some enlightened workers in the factory had repeatedly proposed dealing with these bad elements, but were ultimately rejected by Liu Ying, the factory director at the time. Guo Chengduo and others secretly wooed backward staff members, and together with Qu Jirong and Guo Zhenwen, who had consistently bullied workers in the past, controlled the staff and worker representative assembly and the trade union committee. As a result, nine out of the eleven members of the factory's trade union had political problems. Last year, Guo Chengduo and others conspired to force worker representatives to sign and stamp documents in the name of "not losing their jobs," using the name of the staff and worker representative assembly to launch "petitions" and "strikes" to disrupt production, causing the urgent task of × tens of thousands of cloth shoes to not be completed on time. When the factory was making × ten thousand × thousand pairs of military leather shoes for a certain military region last September, these bad elements conspired to agitate workers to demand excessive wages under the pretext of "low wages" and "poor materials," causing the batch of shoes to be poorly made and wasting more than two thousand catties of leather. At that time, some workers, in order to complete this task well, had put forward many rationalization proposals, but because of the obstruction of these bad elements, they were not adopted by the leadership. Usually, these bad elements even attacked activists, Party members, and Youth League members among the workers. When the factory sent employees to Shijiazhuang to learn advanced experience, the bad element Qu Jirong said, "They are just going to Shijiazhuang to eat free food for a few days." These bad elements weighed on the workers, creating disunity among the staff and workers and disunity among the workers themselves. The workers said, "The sky is still theirs (referring to the feudal forces), and it's useless to make suggestions." "Taiyuan has been liberated, but the sky hasn't dawned at our shoe factory."

  Struggling Against Feudal Forces
    In mid-July of this year, the factory launched a democratic reform movement under the unified leadership of the Party branch in accordance with the demands of the masses. Because the factory's leading cadres had not valued the opinions of the workers in the past, everyone was afraid that "making suggestions wouldn't work" when the democratic reform movement began. The bad elements took advantage of this loophole and spread rumors everywhere, saying, "Don't bother making suggestions, it's useless." The factory's leading cadres initially understood this situation and repeatedly explained the policy of democratic reform, deeply mobilizing the masses, and, through the activists among the staff and workers, inspired everyone to expose and accuse the special agents and tyrants. Workers Zhang Zhenhua and Hu Genxi angrily accused the feudal tyrant Guo Chengduo, who was most hated by the masses, of his crimes of persecuting them before liberation, which stimulated the fighting spirit of the workers. Some workers who were not directly victimized also actively participated in this movement. Everyone unanimously demanded that the feudal tyrant Guo Chengduo be handed over to the government for legal action. The leadership timely supported the workers and masses, and agreed to everyone's reasonable demands. Worker Lei Zilin said happily, "Today is happier than the New Year, we are truly liberated!" Chen Ruihu said, "Now I can finally breathe a sigh of relief, the workers have truly turned over!" At that time, some bad elements also conspired to alienate the workers, but were finally exposed by the workers. On the basis of this mass accusation of tyrants, the factory further rectified the ranks, distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, enabled the staff and workers to grasp the principle of "treating them differently," and continued to accuse and expose the criminal facts of Meng Zongshun, Zheng Jinzhang, and the counter-revolutionary special agent Zhou Qichang. After democratic discussions among the staff and workers, these guys were handed over to the government for legal action. Other feudal lackeys and bad elements whose crimes were not serious were also given penalties such as control, transfer, and demotion. This democratic reform movement strengthened the internal unity of the working class. In the past, workshops such as the shoe-stitching workshop had "native place" sectarian small groups and had not formulated a patriotic pact. In the democratic reform movement, the workers criticized these mistakes. Some workers said, "The bad element Guo Zhenwen is from our hometown, but during Yan's 'Three Self-Reliance Training,' he beat precisely people from our hometown." The workers learned to analyze problems from a class perspective and realized that only when the working class unites can production be improved. The relationship between staff and workers has also been initially improved. Worker Tian Hengtai said, "Now I don't feel awkward talking to the staff members anymore."

  Democratic Reform Completed, Production Efficiency Soars
    After the democratic reform, the feudal forces were defeated, and the factory was filled with a new atmosphere. From the recent production situation of the factory, we can see the great power of the workers to actively produce with the attitude of masters. When the democratic reform was in full swing, the factory accepted an urgent task of more than 7,000 pairs of leather shoes. The first difficulty encountered was the lack of skilled workers and the abundance of apprentices. If based on past experience, the task could not be completed on time. However, when discussing this task, the workers actively put forward ways to overcome the difficulties. Everyone believed that "the masters do the difficult parts, and the apprentices do the easy parts, which can solve the difficulty of having fewer skilled workers and more apprentices." But in the process of doing it, the phenomenon of poor quality was discovered, and everyone consciously discussed and corrected this shortcoming. When the factory made shoes ordered by a certain military region last year, several meetings were also convened, but because the bad elements were in control, the goal of overcoming difficulties was not achieved. This year, the raw materials were the same as last year, and the workers not only did not say "the raw materials are bad" like last year, but also saved material costs worth more than six hundred catties of leather, completed the task on time, and not a single pair of shoes failed to meet the specifications. Production in various workshops has also generally increased, with the production efficiency of the machine group increasing by two times compared to before the democratic reform. The sole-nailing workshop has increased by an average of more than 30 percent compared to before the democratic reform. Now, the various groups have formulated patriotic pacts, and the workers have participated in current affairs and political studies, actively launching a movement to increase production and donate. The workers say well: "Our shoe factory has changed!"

　　“咱们鞋厂变样了！”
     ——记太原人民鞋厂民主改革前后
      段涟
    编者按：这篇通讯说明了实行民主改革的必要；同时也可以说明：华北地区各厂矿企业虽一般已进行过民主改革，但还不能说一切厂矿均已进行过，或均已进行得十分彻底。因此，凡是没有进行民主改革或进行得不彻底的工矿企业，都应该好好地补这一课。
          太原人民鞋厂民主改革胜利完成，工人生产情绪普遍提高。大家都说：“咱们鞋厂变样了。”这句话反映出工人们在工厂里真正当家作主了。太原解放已经两年多，为什么工人们到现在才说这句话呢？让我们回忆一下解放两年来的人民鞋厂吧：
  民主改革前封建恶霸阻碍生产
    该鞋厂在解放前，原来是属于阎锡山匪军军工生产系统的。解放后，该厂领导干部依靠工人阶级搞好企业的思想不明确，片面地以为实行民主改革，会“影响生产”。不加分析地以为：“团结一个技术人员顶得上十个工人”，因而该厂对那些过去骑在工人头上残酷迫害工人的封建恶霸和特务郭承铎、孟宗舜、郑锦章等没有适当地加以处理，这些坏分子竟然原封不动地当了该厂的科长、主任等要职，领导干部竟被他们的“请客”“送礼”等封建方式所包围。该厂有些觉悟了的工人虽曾数次提出要处理这些坏分子的意见，但终于被原任该厂厂长刘英拒绝。郭承铎等暗地拉拢落后职员，和过去一贯欺压工人的狗腿子曲计荣、郭振文等，控制了职工代表会和工会委员会。因此该厂工会十一个委员中就有九个有政治问题的。去年郭承铎等曾阴谋以“不失业”为名，强迫工人代表签名盖章，利用职工代表会名义，发动“请愿”和“罢工”，破坏生产，使得正在进行着的×万双布鞋的紧急任务，没有按时完成。当去年九月份该厂制做某军区×万×千双军皮鞋的时候，这些坏分子又阴谋以“工资少”“料不好”等名义，鼓动工人要求过高的工资，使得这批鞋子没有做好，浪费了两千多斤皮子。当时有些工人为了很好地完成这个任务，曾提出不少合理化建议，但因为这些坏分子的阻挠，没有被领导上采纳。平时这些坏分子更打击工人中的积极分子和党员、团员。该厂派职工到石家庄学习先进经验时，坏分子曲计荣说：“他们不过到石家庄吃几天闲饭。”这些坏分子压在工人头上，造成了职工不团结和工人之间不团结的现象。工人们说：“天还是人家的（指封建势力），提意见也不顶事。”“太原解放了，咱们鞋厂天还没亮。”
  向封建势力作斗争
    今年七月中旬，该厂根据群众要求，在党支部统一领导下，开展了民主改革运动。由于过去该厂领导干部不重视工人意见，因此在民主改革运动开始时，大家总怕“提意见不顶事”。坏分子就钻了这个空子，到处散布空气说：“大家不要提意见了，提了也是白提。”该厂领导干部初步了解了这个情况，就反复地说明民主改革的政策，深入发动群众，通过职工中的积极分子，启发大家检举和控诉特务恶霸。工友张振华、胡根喜等痛恨地控诉了群众最痛恨的封建恶霸郭承铎在解放前迫害他们的罪恶，这样便激发了工人群众的斗争情绪。一些没有直接受害的工人，也积极起来参加这个运动。大家一致要求把封建恶霸郭承铎送交政府法办。领导方面及时地给工人群众撑腰，答应了大家的合理要求。工友雷子林高兴地说：“今天比过年都高兴，咱们可真解放啦！”陈瑞虎说：“现在才出了这口气，工人真是翻身了！”当时有些坏分子还阴谋离间工人群众，但终于被工人们揭穿了。在这个群众性的控诉恶霸的基础上，该厂又进一步地整顿队伍，分清敌我界线，使工友们掌握了“分别对待”的方针，继续控诉和检举了孟宗舜、郑锦章以及反革命特务周其昌的罪恶事实。经过工友们民主讨论，将这些家伙送政府法办。对于其他封建狗腿子和罪恶不大的坏分子，也分别给予管制，调职和降级等处分。通过这个民主改革运动，加强了工人阶级内部的团结。过去绱鞋等车间因为有“同乡”宗派小集体，没有订好爱国公约。在民主改革运动中，工人们批判了这些错误。有的工人说：“坏分子郭振文到是咱同乡，可是在阎匪‘三自传训’时，他打的偏是咱们同乡。”工人们知道了从阶级上分析问题，体会到只有工人阶级团结起来才能搞好生产。职工关系也初步地得到改善。工友田恒泰说：“现在和职员说话，也不觉着蹩扭了。”
  民主改革完成，生产效率激增
    经过民主改革，封建势力被打垮，该厂充满了新的气象。从最近该厂生产上的情况，可以看出工人真正以主人翁的姿态积极生产的伟大力量。在民主改革进行到火热的时候，该厂接受了七千多双皮鞋的紧急任务。首先遇到的困难，就是技工少，工徒多。如果按照过去的经验，就不能按时完成任务。但在讨论这次任务时，工人们积极地提出克服困难的办法，大家认为“师傅做难的部分，徒弟做容易部分，就可以解决技工少徒工多的困难”。但在做的过程中，又发现质量不好的现象，大家又自觉地讨论和纠正了这个缺点。去年该厂做某军区订做的鞋子的时候，也曾经召集过几次会议，但因坏分子控制，没有达到克服困难的目的。今年原料和去年一样，工友们不但没有像去年那样说“原料不好”，而且还节省了价值六百多斤皮子的材料费，按时完成了任务，没有一双鞋不合规格。各车间生产也普遍提高，机器组的生产效率比民主改革前提高了两倍。钉底车间比民主改革前平均提高了百分之三十以上。现在各小组订了爱国公约，工友们都参加了时事政治学习，积极展开增产捐献运动。工友们说得好：“咱们鞋厂变样了！”
