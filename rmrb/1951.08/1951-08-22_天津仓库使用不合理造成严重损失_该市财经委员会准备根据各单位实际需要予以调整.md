Tianjin Warehouse Use Unreasonable, Causing Serious Losses
The Municipal Finance and Economics Committee Prepares to Adjust According to the Actual Needs of Various Units

To the Editor:

The warehouses of various state-owned enterprises in the Tianjin area (including Tianjin, Junliangcheng, Xinhe, and Tanggu) were allocated and used according to the original receiving systems at the time of liberation. Due to the long-term lack of adjustment, some departments have a large amount of materials but no warehouses, while some departments have warehouses but no materials. This unreasonable situation has caused huge losses to national wealth and affected the exchange of materials. Now, the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee has discovered this situation and formulated a preliminary plan to adjust the existing public warehouses according to the actual needs of various public enterprises, so that they can be used reasonably and reduce the loss of national materials. I think this is a beneficial measure. The phenomenon of unreasonable warehouse use may also exist in other regions. Therefore, I am telling you about the serious losses of state property caused by the unreasonable use of warehouses in Tianjin, hoping to draw the attention of various places to conduct inspections and corrections.

According to a survey conducted by the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee in May of this year, the total existing capacity of public warehouses in the Tianjin area and the total needs of various state-owned enterprises are roughly in line. However, what is the current state of warehouse use?

	On the one hand: some state-owned enterprises have a large amount of goods but lack warehouses, causing serious losses and waste of national assets.

Take the Tianjin Grain Company as an example: because the company itself lacks warehouses, it must pay huge rental fees; rent private warehouses; due to lease restrictions, a large number of grains are often in a floating state year-round and must pay a large amount of handling fees. In addition, there are tens of thousands of tons of grain that can only be piled in the open air due to lack of storage, and the loss and waste are also extremely large (of course, this also includes some waste caused by poor storage). According to statistics, from the liberation of Tianjin to April of this year, the company has lost 30.5 billion yuan in RMB due to the above-mentioned circumstances, equivalent to more than 28.53 million jin of millet, in the past twenty-five months. According to statistics from eleven state-owned specialized companies, 59 percent of the existing materials are stored in the open air, and the extent of the loss is difficult to estimate accurately. Valuable industrial equipment of the China Import Company was stored in the open air, and in March of this year, 62 tons of silicon steel sheets (worth about 70 million yuan per ton) were found to have been soaked in rainwater, of which 10 tons were rusted and unusable, with a total loss of about 700,000 jin of millet; 151 tons of tinplate (worth about 30 million yuan per ton) were rusted by rain and had to be sold at a reduced price. Other companies such as the Import Company, the Oils and Fats Company, and the Trust Company paid 20.4 billion yuan in warehouse and stacking fees last year alone. Similar losses of national wealth due to having goods but no warehouses, according to very incomplete statistics from seven specialized companies, amounted to more than 75 billion yuan, equivalent to more than 65.94 million jin of millet. What an alarming number! If each soldier in the army consumes 60 jin of food per month, the wasted grain can support 1,099,000 people for one month; if each farmer produces 2,000 jin of millet per year, the wasted grain is equivalent to the harvest of about 32,400 farmers' full-year labor.

At the same time, the huge expenditure on warehouse costs has seriously affected the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. According to materials from the North China Native Produce Company, all of the company's materials are stored in rented private warehouses. If general native produce is stored for half a year, the rent paid is about 33 percent of its original value; and some cheaper and larger materials, if stored for less than half a year, are not worth the rent.

	On the other hand: there is a large amount of unused public warehouse space in the Tianjin area, or it has been abandoned for a long time due to disrepair.

For example, the two warehouses at the South Station of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, with a total area of about 300 mu, are the best and largest warehouses in the Tianjin area and can hold 129,680 tons of grain. Except for two warehouses that are rented out, the utilization rate of the remaining nine warehouses is less than 20 percent. A warehouse of the Tianjin Port Authority can hold 9,000 tons of grain, but it has been abandoned for two years and no one cares about it. Other warehouses belonging to the Marketing and Sales Department of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Bohai Reclamation Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Tianjin Office of the Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry are mostly idle or have a very low utilization rate. Some units that do not need warehouses themselves but own a large number of warehouses, such as the Railway Bureau and the Bank, are engaged in freight yard business; their leasing relationship is also abnormal. For example, the Native Produce Company rented warehouses at the South Station of the Railway Bureau last year, but they were taken back in February of this year, and the materials were moved in and out, resulting in great waste. However, the warehouses that were taken back are mostly idle.

The Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee is preparing to reasonably adjust existing public warehouses.

The committee has initially drafted a plan to adjust the existing warehouses according to actual needs, so that they can be used reasonably and protect the state property of those units that have goods but no warehouses. It is hoped that this plan can be realized soon. I believe this is good for stopping the large-scale waste of state property.

Editor's Note: The Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee's preparation to uniformly adjust the warehouses in the Tianjin area and use them reasonably is of great significance in stopping the waste of state assets. Due to the unreasonable use of warehouses, the cost of commodities has been directly increased, which has affected the exchange of materials. Therefore, reasonably adjusting warehouses is also a problem closely related to the entire national economy. Relevant financial and economic departments and the people's governments of major cities should pay attention to this issue.

### 天津仓库使用不合理造成严重损失  该市财经委员会准备根据各单位实际需要予以调整

　　天津仓库使用不合理造成严重损失
    该市财经委员会准备根据各单位实际需要予以调整
    编辑同志：
    天津区（包括天津、军粮城、新河、塘沽）各国营企业部门的仓库，在解放时是按照原接受系统分配使用的。由于长期没有调整，造成了某些部门拥有大量物资而无仓库，某些部门虽有仓库而无物资的不合理情况，使国家财富受到巨大损失，并且影响了物资交流。现在天津市财政经济委员会已经发现这个情况，制订出初步方案，准备根据各公营企业部门的实际需要，调整现有公用仓库，使其得到合理使用，以减少国家物资的损失。我认为，这是一个有益的措施。其他地区仓库使用不合理的现象可能也有。因此，我把天津市因仓库使用不合理而造成国家财产严重损失的情况告诉你们，希望能提起各地注意，对此进行检查纠正。
    据今年五月份天津市财政经济委员会调查：天津区公用仓库现有总容量和各国营企业单位的总需要量大致相符合。但是，目前仓库的使用情况是怎样呢？
  一方面是：某些国营企业单位拥有大量货物而缺乏仓库，造成国
        家资财的严重损失和浪费。
    举天津市粮食公司为例：该公司因为本身缺乏仓库，就必须付出庞大的租栈费；租用私人库场；因为租期限制，大批粮食常年处于游动状态，并须付出大量搬运费。此外，还有数以万吨计的粮食因无仓库存放，只得堆在露天，损耗浪费也极庞大（当然其中也包括由保管不善所造成的一部分浪费）。该公司从天津解放到今年四月为止，据统计二十五月内由于上述情况，损失人民币达三百零五亿元，折合小米二千八百五十三万余斤。另据十一个国营专业公司统计，现有物资的百分之五十九系露天存放，其损耗之大，难以精确估计。中国进口公司的贵重工业器材，因露天存放，在今年三月份就发现有六十二吨矽钢片（每吨价值约七千万元）遭受雨水浸袭，其中十吨生锈无法使用，损失总值约七十万斤小米；马口铁一五一吨（每吨价值约三千万元）遭雨淋生锈，均须贬值出售。其他如进口公司、油脂公司、信托公司在去年一年内付出的和栈费即达二百零四亿元。类似这样有货无库而使国家财富遭受的损失，据七个专业公司极不完全的统计，即达七百五十亿以上，折合小米六千五百九十四万余斤。这是一个多么惊人的数字！如果部队中每人每月食粮六十斤，此项浪费的粮食就可以供养一百零九万九千人一个月；如果每个农民每年生产小米二千斤，这项浪费的粮食约等于三万二千四百个农民全年劳动的收获。
    同时，仓库费用开支的庞大，已经严重地影响了城乡内外物资的交流。据华北土产公司材料，该公司全部物资均系租用私人仓库放存。一般土产如果存放半年，付出租栈费约等于其原值的百分之三十三；而某些较贱而体积较大的物资，放存不到半年，其原值已不足付其租栈的费用。
  另一方面是：天津区有大批公用仓库空间未用，或者因为破烂而
        长期废弃。
    如天津铁路局南站的两个仓库，总面积约合三百亩，都是天津区最好最大的仓库，可容粮食一二九·六八○吨。其中除两个库房租出外，其余九个库房的利用率均不足百分之二十。天津港务局的一个仓库，可容粮食九千吨，但两年来一直废弃，无人过问。其他如重工业部经理司供销处、农业部渤海农垦局、重工业部钢铁工业局天津事务所等处所属仓库，大部空闲或利用率很小。某些本身不需用仓库而拥有大量库场的单位，如铁路局和银行则在经营货栈业务；其租赁关系也是不正常的。像土产公司在去年租用铁路局南站仓库，到今年二月即被收回，物资搬进搬出，浪费很大。而这项被收回的库房，也多空闲着。
  天津市财经委员会，已准备合理调整现有公用仓库。
    该会已初步拟订出方案，准备根据实际需要，调整现有的仓库，使之合理利用，让那些有货无库的单位的国家财产得到保护。希望这个方案能够很快实现。我认为这对于停止国家财产大规模的浪费是有好处的。
          郝林
    编者按：天津市财政经济委员会准备统一调整天津区仓库，予以合理使用，这在杜绝国家资财的浪费上，是有重要意义的。由于仓库的使用不合理，已经直接加大了商品的成本，影响了物资的交流。因此，合理地调整仓库也是一项与整个国民经济有密切关系的问题。有关的财经部门及各大城市人民政府应对这个问题予以重视。
