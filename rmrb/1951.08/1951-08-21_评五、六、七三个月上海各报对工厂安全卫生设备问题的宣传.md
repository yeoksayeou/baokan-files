　　Review of Shanghai Newspapers' Publicity on Factory Safety and Hygiene Equipment in May, June, and July
　　Xing Hua
　　Since the Central People's Government promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations, and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government established the principle that municipal construction should serve production and, first and foremost, the working class, regular reporting on specific improvements in this area, as well as criticism of erroneous ideas that disregard worker safety, should be an important part of current newspaper propaganda. However, according to the findings of this office (Shanghai Municipal People's Government News and Publication Bureau), many public and private newspapers in Shanghai have not given this sufficient attention. Based on published materials, from May to July this year, major casualty accidents occurred in various factories. For example, the May 10th report on workers injured at Yihua Steel Factory due to an explosion in a smelting furnace, and the May 25th report on a worker at Landa Sawmill being crushed to death due to the factory's neglect of safety equipment. The June 27th report on workers Dong Er and Wu Lin'gen at Tianzhang Paper Mill being seriously injured due to the factory's lack of attention to safety equipment, and the June 9th report on labor model Zhao Ruisheng of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company dying from electric shock. The July 20th report on two workers injured and killed at Wanxing Foundry, and the July 22nd report on a worker at Wuzhou Guben Soap Factory falling into a caustic soda pool and dying tragically. Although these incidents have attracted the attention of relevant parties such as the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, and the Shanghai Municipal judicial authorities have sentenced certain managers and factory directors responsible for the accidents to imprisonment and ordered the improvement of factory safety equipment, the impact of these measures has not been widespread and profound due to the insufficient attention paid to this area by Shanghai newspapers.
　　During these three months, reports on factory safety and hygiene equipment in various newspapers were generally published as local news in the local edition (Dagong Bao and Xinwen Ribao on page 4, Wenhui Bao on page 3, Jiefang Ribao and Laodong Bao on page 2). Readers' criticisms were only published in the letters to the editor section or supplements, and rarely were important events selected and published in prominent positions. Not only that, but it was rare for them to be published as front-page headlines in the local edition. The newspapers never paid attention to commenting on related events to strengthen the effect of publicity. For example, on July 18th, the Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau, the Federation of Trade Unions, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, etc., held a publicity conference to promote factory safety and hygiene work. Xu Zhouliang, Deputy Director of the Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, made a very important report at the meeting. It is very necessary to carry out large-scale publicity based on the spirit of this report. However, some newspapers did not even publish this report, let alone comment on it.
　　Judging from the number of news items related to factory safety and hygiene equipment published by the newspapers, except for the Laodong Bao, the other newspapers published very few. In May, Laodong Bao published a total of 23 articles, Jiefang Ribao only nine, and Xinwen Ribao, Dagong Bao, and Wenhui Bao published even fewer, only five or six. Among them, major casualty accidents such as the explosion of the smelting furnace at Yihua Steel Factory on May 10th and the worker being crushed to death at Landa Sawmill on May 25th were not reported by Jiefang Ribao. And important news such as the state-owned Shanghai Cotton Textile Factory No. 7 caring about workers' health and lowering the temperature in the workshop, the China Textile Factory having a worker sanatorium, and the Huayang Yarn Factory formulating a plan to improve hygiene equipment, was omitted by Xinwen Ribao, Dagong Bao, and Wenhui Bao. In June, Xinwen Ribao published seven articles on labor protection, Dagong Bao five, and Wenhui Bao three. Jiefang Ribao published eight, but important news such as the accident of the Tianzhou fracture at Zhanghua Woolen Mill due to disregard for worker safety was not published. Laodong Bao published 31 news items related to this aspect in June, but there was no report on this incident either. In July, Laodong Bao published 16 news items related to factory safety and hygiene, Jiefang Ribao 14, Xinwen Ribao six, Dagong Bao seven, and Wenhui Bao only four. The newspapers also had their own shortcomings in handling certain major accidents. For example, the news of a worker at Wuzhou Guben Soap Factory falling into a caustic soda pool and dying tragically was published by Dagong Bao, Xinwen Ribao, and Laodong Bao in a three-column position, but Jiefang Ribao only published it as a short item at the end of page 2, and Wenhui Bao did not mention it at all. For example, only Xinwen Ribao reported the incident of a trainee electrician being electrocuted to death at Chenglong Firefighting Machinery Factory due to the failure to replace broken wires; only Dagong Bao reported the incident of two workers being injured and killed at Wanxing Foundry due to disregard for safety equipment. The newspapers did not pay attention to the improvement of workers' safety and hygiene equipment that some factories have begun to pay attention to (such as the state-owned Shanghai Cotton Textile Factory No. 6, Xinhua, Maosheng and other factories reducing workshop temperature and improving hygiene equipment).
　　The newspapers' reports on these events are often incomplete. For example, in mid-May, Laodong Bao reported the case of Wang Liansheng, a worker at the Shanghai Railway Bureau, who died after working continuously for 32 hours. The Ministry of Railways issued a notice to various bureaus to pay attention to improvements. As for whether the Shanghai Bureau has improved, neither Laodong Bao nor other newspapers have reported it. For example, Jiefang Ribao published suggestions and news on the need to improve the safety and hygiene of various dyeing and weaving factories in Shanghai, but did not follow up on whether the factories had accepted the newspapers' suggestions. Dagong Bao and others published news that Zhanghua Woolen Mill had decided to improve its methods after an accident, but did not continue to report whether the methods had been implemented to improve the situation.
　　In addition, some cunning factories concealed incidents after they occurred. For example, on May 12, the Shanghai News Agency reported: "Some factories ignore safety issues and conceal incidents after they occur. Among them, Mingming Chemical Factory, Hengda Fire Engine Manufacturing Factory, Yuxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory No. 2, British Yihua Yarn Factory, Tianzhang Paper Mill West Factory, and Shenxin No. 6 Textile Factory have been punished by the Municipal Labor Bureau, etc." It can be seen that at present, many private factory capitalists still have a serious tendency to disregard the safety of workers' lives. Newspapers should promptly expose these incidents and pay attention to every improvement in every factory in order to urge administrative organs and educate capitalists and workers to jointly pay attention to improving factory safety and hygiene equipment.
　　Caring about the lives and safety of the working class anytime and anywhere is the responsibility of the people's newspapers. Newspapers must take on this responsibility. (Sent from Shanghai on August 13)

### 评五、六、七三个月上海各报对工厂安全卫生设备问题的宣传

　　评五、六、七三个月上海各报对工厂安全卫生设备问题的宣传
    醒华
    自从中央人民政府公布了劳动保险条例，上海市人民政府确定了市政建设应为生产服务，首先应为工人阶级服务的方针以后，经常报道这一方面具体改进情况，及批评不注意工人安全的错误思想，便应当是当前报纸宣传的一个重要内容。可是，据本处（上海市人民政府新闻出版处）检查结果，发现上海许多公私营报纸对此仍未引起足够的重视。根据已发表的材料，从今年五月到七月的三个月中，各工厂先后发生的重大伤亡事故，五月十日报载益华钢铁厂工人因化铁炉发生爆炸受伤及五月二十五日报载联大锯木厂工人因工厂忽视安全设备被轧身死等事件。六月二十七日报载天章纸厂工人董阿二、吴林根因工厂不重视安全设备受重伤及六月九日报载闸北水电公司劳动模范赵瑞生触电致死等事件。七月二十日报载万兴翻砂厂两工人受伤身死，及二十二日报载五洲固本皂厂一工人跌入烧碱池惨死等事件。这些事件虽已引起有关方面如上海市总工会及上海市人民政府劳动局等的重视，上海市司法机关并将某些应负事故责任的经理、厂长等处以徒刑，判令改善工厂安全设备，但是，由于上海各报对这方面的宣传不够重视，这些措施的影响也就不够普遍和深入。
    在此三个月中，各报关于工厂安全卫生设备的报道，一般只当作本市新闻发表在本市版（大公报、新闻日报刊第四版，文汇报刊第三版，解放日报、劳动报刊第二版），读者的批评也只是发表在读者来信版或副刊里面，很少有选择其中重要事件在重要地位发表的。不但如此，甚至当作本市版头条发表的也很少。各报更从未注意对有关事件加以评论，以加强宣传的效果。如七月十八日上海市劳动局、总工会、工商联等，为推动工厂安全卫生工作举行宣传大会，市人民政府劳动局徐周良副局长在会议上作了一个很重要的报告，根据这个报告的精神进行大规模的宣传，很有必要。可是，有些报纸连这个报告都没有登，更不用说加以评论了。
    从各报所发表的有关工厂安全卫生消息的数量来看，除了劳动报较多以外，其他各报都很少。五月份劳动报共刊出二十三篇，解放日报只有九篇，新闻日报、大公报和文汇报登得更少，不过五、六篇。其中重大伤亡事故如五月十日益华钢铁厂化铁炉爆炸及二十五日联大锯木厂轧死工人等，解放日报没有报道。而国营上海棉纺第七厂关心工人健康降低车间温度，中华纺织厂有了工人疗养室，华阳纱厂订出计划改进卫生设备等重要新闻又为新闻日报、大公报和文汇报等所漏登。六月份关于劳动保护的新闻，新闻日报登了七篇，大公报五篇，文汇报三篇。解放日报登了八篇，但是重要新闻如章华毛纺厂因不重视工人安全发生天轴断裂的事件，未见刊登。劳动报六月份发表有关这方面的新闻三十一篇，其中也没有关于这个事件的报道。七月份有关工厂安全卫生的新闻，劳动报登了十六篇，解放日报十四篇，新闻日报六篇，大公报七篇，文汇报仅四篇。各报对某些重大事故的处理，也各有欠妥之处。如五洲固本皂厂一工人跌入烧碱池中惨死事件的新闻，大公报、新闻日报及劳动报以三栏地位刊载，解放日报却只作为短栏登在二版最后一条，文汇报则只字未提。又如承隆消防机器厂因不拆换已坏电线致一学徒触电而死事件，只新闻日报一家有报道；万兴翻砂厂因漠视安全设备致有两工人受伤身死事件，仅大公报一家有报道。各报对于有些工厂已开始注意工人安全卫生设备的改进（如国营上海棉纺第六厂、新华、茂盛等厂减低车间温度及改进卫生设备等），都未加重视。
    各报报道这方面的事件也往往是有头无尾的。如劳动报在五月中旬所报道的上海铁路局工友王连生连续工作三十二小时致死案，铁道部曾通告各局注意改进，至于上海局改进与否，劳动报及其他报纸都没有报道。又如解放日报发表对上海染织业各厂安全卫生须改进的建议及新闻，但并没有追查厂方是否已经接受报纸的建议。大公报等发表章华毛纺厂出事故后决定改进办法的新闻，但没有继续报道是否已经贯彻该项办法，做到改善。
    此外还有一些狡猾的厂方在发生了事故后隐瞒不报，如五月十二日沪市新闻处讯：“部分工厂漠视安全问题，发生事故后隐瞒不报，其中明明化学厂，亨大救火车制造厂，裕新染织厂二厂，英商怡和纱厂，天章造纸厂西厂，申新第六纺织厂等，市劳动局等已分别予以处分。”可见目前许多私营工厂资本家都还有严重的漠视工人生命安全的倾向。报纸对于这些事件应当及时加以揭露，并注意每一工厂的每一改进，以督促行政机关并教育资方和工友来共同注意改善工厂的安全卫生设备。
    随时随地关心工人阶级的生活与安全，是人民报纸的职责。报纸必须负起这个责任来。    （八月十三日寄自上海）
