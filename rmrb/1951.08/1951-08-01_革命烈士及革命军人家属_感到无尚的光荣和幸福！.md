　　Revolutionary Martyrs and Families of Revolutionary Soldiers
    Feel Supreme Glory and Happiness!
        My son Hanlin heroically sacrificed himself. It is the glory of our working people.
        —Letter from the father of Martyr Xu Hanlin

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
    With the arrival of the good "August 1st" holiday, I am writing to report to you what I have long wanted to say.
    I am Hanlin's father, living in Xinlitun Village, Alukeerqin Banner, Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, our great motherland. I am sixty-two years old this year, and I have spent most of my life working for the landlords. When Hanlin was twelve years old, his mother died of illness. Later, I ran to Linxi to escape the famine and fostered Hanlin in his aunt's house. People like me, who had no place to stand, did not see hope until "August 15th" when you—Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu—commanded the Eighth Route Army to come here and liberate us. Then I was allocated eleven mu and nine fen of land, an ox for plowing, and a house. I immediately became someone with a home and a career. In 1949, Hanlin joined our Eighth Route Army—the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Our army fought from the north to the south and has already driven the Chiang bandits out of mainland China. Unexpectedly, last September, when my Hanlin heroically sacrificed himself while suppressing bandits in Panshi Village, Lingshan, Guangdong, I felt a little sad at the time! But after slowly considering it, his behavior of loving the motherland, loving the people, and hating the enemy is not precisely the glorious manifestation of a good son of our working people? Thinking of it this way, I not only don't feel sad, but I feel glorious instead. After Hanlin's sacrifice, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the People's Government of Aqi sent people to our village to hold a memorial service. The government also gave me a consolation payment of 700,000 yuan in Renminbi, more than 100 feet of cloth, and more than 1,500 jin of grain. Hanlin's leaders and comrades-in-arms sent more than 200 letters of comfort one after another. The cadres often asked me about my well-being. The villagers took care of me everywhere. The Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in the village all educated themselves with Hanlin's deeds. Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu: Isn't this glory I have gained from you teaching my son to perform heroic deeds? I really can't express how grateful I am to you.
    Before the new year, I bought another eleven mu of land. I and my crippled son (Hanlin's older brother) are working hard in production and have nothing to worry about. The village also wanted to farm the land for me as a substitute, but I refused. I think I can work, so why bother the villagers again. My family has already made a patriotic agreement, and I will do my best in the weapon donation movement. Regardless of how the ceasefire negotiations on the Korean front go, I keep the thought of "preventing theft every day and thieves every night" in my mind and will not slack off in the slightest! Only in this way can I firmly protect this prosperous life, glorious status, and the national defense of the motherland.
        Respectfully wishing you good health!
                                           Respectfully, Xu Duo
        Our present glorious and happy days are all brought about by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.
        —Letter from more than 600 families of martyrs and soldiers in the Fifth District of Chongqing

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
    We are the families of martyrs and soldiers in the Fifth District of Chongqing City. The "August 1st" Army Day is approaching. Looking at the glorious and happy days we are living, we can't help but write this letter to report to you.
    Our children and husbands were mostly conscripted by the Kuomintang before liberation. Thinking of the viciousness of the Chiang bandits, everyone gritted their teeth! Poor families who had sons were as if they had committed a heinous crime, hiding here and there, with the whole family as anxious as ants on a hot pot. Chen Da Niang's son secretly married a wife. As the young couple were kowtowing in the wedding ceremony, the puppet Baozhang (local security chief) came and forcibly dragged him away. Zhao Liancheng's son gouged out his own eyes with a knife to avoid conscription. Some people even chopped off their fingers and arms. After Chen Pengshi's eldest son was conscripted, her fifteen-year-old younger son hid in the pigsty, but was also taken away.
    After our children and husbands were taken away, we had nowhere to appeal for injustice, nowhere to speak our minds, and no one cared about our life or death. Fortunately, we had your wise leadership, which liberated us and our children and husbands and allowed them to join the People's Liberation Army. Last year, the People's Government had not been established for long, and various conditions were still very difficult, but it immediately took care of us, distributing more than 46,000 jin of living allowance grain in succession to help us settle down. More than 100 of our children are supplied with free schooling by the public; if we get sick, public hospitals give us free treatment. More than 100 of us were unemployed, and the government introduced us to jobs. In this spring's land reform, the 180 poor families of martyrs and soldiers living in the suburbs were each allocated an average of four shi and two dou (each shi is 150 jin) of rice-growing land. The villagers treat us very well, giving us the best land first. For the families of martyrs and soldiers who lack labor, they also adopted the method of contracted farming, automatically farming the land for us, cultivating our fields first before cultivating their own. They not only cultivate it well for us, but also guarantee to plant well, harvest well, and thresh well, personally delivering it to our homes, without even letting us treat them to a cup of tea. Now the sweet potatoes have been planted, and the vines are more than a foot long. The rice seedlings in the fields have been weeded twice, and the seedlings are fat and strong, with the early ones already heading. Every family of martyrs and soldiers has their houses piled high with golden corn, and now they have no worries about what to eat or wear. Hu Yangshi, a military dependent, had never eaten her fill since she was born. Before liberation, she couldn't even get bran to eat. Now that she has been allocated land, she has a constant supply of coarse grains and rice, and can also afford to eat oil and salt.
    In the urban area, in addition to introducing jobs, the government also adopted the method of organizing production to solve our production difficulties. The residents of the streets have all listed treating us favorably as the most important item in the patriotic agreement. Since April of this year, everyone has donated money and contributed or lent houses and furniture to help us establish thirteen collective production organizations. Now business is very good. Taking the Nanpingchang Grain and Rice Store as an example, it earned a net profit of 7 million yuan in three months. The six people in the store each received more than 1 million yuan. Not only was the family life problem solved, but they also had money left over. Some added furniture, and some added new clothes.
    Now, everyone of us is beaming with joy, and the glorious plaque hangs on our doors. Everyone comes to congratulate us during festivals. We walk with our backs straight, no longer with the frowning faces of the past. Xiao Zhuquan, a military dependent, is sixty-four years old and has been a poor primary school teacher for more than thirty years. No one looked up to him, and no one listened to him when he spoke. Now he is a representative of the district people and can speak in public.
    We will never fail to live up to the government and the masses' love. We often write letters to encourage our children and husbands in the army to do a good job in defending the motherland and defending our happy days. We will never lag behind, and will try our best to achieve self-sufficiency in production and reduce the burden on the government and the masses. Last year, 480 of the 656 families of martyrs and soldiers in the district received government living allowances. This has been reduced to 203 families during the Spring Festival this year, and to 37 families during the Dragon Boat Festival. Now only one old and weak family needs government assistance, and the others can all be self-reliant. Many models have emerged among our families of martyrs and soldiers in their work. Cheng Guanghua enthusiastically publicizes the Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and has become a propagandist. Liu Dengsu assists the public security organs in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and has been elected as the women's armed squad leader. Many others have been elected as women's representatives or district and street people's representatives.
    This is all the glory that you, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, have brought us. If there were no Communist Party and no leadership from you, how could we have such glorious days! We have signed a patriotic agreement to ensure that under your wise leadership, we will redouble our efforts to actively produce, humbly learn from the masses, and strive to play a model role in various tasks.
    With the highest respect!
                     The 656 families of martyrs and soldiers in the Fifth District of Chongqing City
        You have cultivated my daughter into a hero.
        I also want to strive to be a model in the whole village.
        —Letter from Guo Junqing's mother

Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
    While celebrating the "August 1st" Army Day, I am extremely grateful that you have cultivated my daughter Guo Junqing into a female combat hero loved by the whole country. Since liberation here, I, an old poor woman who used to beg for food, am now well-fed, well-clothed, and respected.
    I now have twenty-four mu of land, and the village is helping me build a new house. Junqing's troops have also sent me a living allowance of 200,000 yuan in Renminbi. The government lent me a castrated bull for plowing free of charge. During festivals, the government and villagers also send meat and noodles, taking care of everything very thoughtfully. The autumn seedlings in the fields are growing vigorously and have been hoed and cultivated on time. I have no difficulties at all. When Junqing's troops sent a living allowance, her younger brother said with emotion, "My sister has loyally made contributions to the country and the people and won glory, and I must learn from her!"
    The people in our village have taken a step forward in raising their awareness in the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, understanding that putting the interests of the country first. Every household has signed a patriotic agreement. The whole village is now carrying out the movement to donate airplanes and artillery, and is checking the work of consoling and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers; striving to become a model village in these tasks. I also want to strive to be a model in the whole village.
    Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu! I use the action of striving to be a model to wish you good health forever! I wish every soldier of the People's Liberation Army under your leadership will become a hero in defending the motherland!
        With
    Highest respect!
                     Taibaimiao Village, Balin Left Banner, Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
                                   From Guo Junqing's mother, Gong Baoxia
                                                July 28

　　革命烈士及革命军人家属
    感到无尚的光荣和幸福！
            我儿子汉林壮烈牺牲了  是咱们劳动人民的光荣
            ——徐汉林烈士的父亲的信敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    赶上“八一”这个好节气，向你报告一下我老早想对你说的话。
    我是汉林的爹，住在咱们伟大祖国的内蒙古自治区昭乌达盟阿鲁科尔沁旗新立屯村，我今年六十二岁，多半辈子都是给地主扛大活。在汉林十二岁时他母亲病死，以后我就跑到林西打饥荒，把汉林寄养在他姑姑家。像我这样贫无立锥之地的人，一直顶到“八一五”才盼到了你——毛主席、朱总司令指挥的八路军开到我们这里，解放了我们。随后我就分到了十一亩九分地，一条耕牛，一间房子，马上成了有家有业的人家了。一九四九年，汉林参加上咱们的八路军——中国人民解放军。咱们军队从北打到南，已经把蒋匪帮赶出了中国大陆。没想到去年九月在广东灵山盘石村剿匪时，我的汉林壮烈牺牲了，当时我感到有点难过！可慢慢一思摸，他这样爱祖国，爱人民，痛恨敌人的行为，不正是咱们劳动人民的好儿子的光荣表现吗？这么一想，我不但不难过，倒反觉得光荣。汉林牺牲以后，内蒙古自治区人民政府、阿旗人民政府，都派人来我村给开追悼大会，政府又抚恤了我七十万人民币，一百多尺布，一千五百多斤粮食，汉林的首长和战友又接二连三来了二百多封安慰我的信。干部又常问我寒暖。乡亲们各处都照顾我。村里的共产党员、青年团员都以汉林的事迹教育自己。毛主席、朱总司令：我这份光荣，还不是你教导我儿子立下了英雄业迹给我换来的吗？我真说不上怎样感谢你才对。
    年前我又新买了十一亩地，我和我一个拐腿儿子（汉林的哥）劳动生产，什么都不愁。村里还要给我代耕，我也拒绝了。我想自己能劳动，何必再累赘乡亲们呢。我家已订出了爱国公约，在捐献武器运动中，我也要尽自己的力量。不管朝鲜前线停战谈判如何，我是存着“天天防盗、夜夜防贼”的心思，毫不松劲！这样才能把我这富裕的生活、光荣的地位和祖国的国防，保得牢靠。
        敬祝健康！
                                           徐铎  敬上
            我们现在的光荣幸福的日子都是毛主席朱总司令带给的
            ——重庆第五区六百多户烈军属的信敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    我们是重庆市第五区的烈属军属。“八一”建军节快到了，瞧着眼前过着的光荣、愉快日子，我们不由得要写这封信向您们报告。
    我们的子弟、丈夫，大都是解放前被国民党抓壮丁抓去的。想起蒋匪的狠毒，那一个不咬牙切齿！穷人家有了儿子，就像犯了十恶大罪，东藏西躲，一家人急得像热锅上的蚂蚁。陈大娘的儿子偷着娶媳妇，小两口正拜堂，伪保长一来，就生拉活扯地给绑去了。赵连成的儿子为逃避抓丁，用刀子挖瞎了自己的眼睛。有的人还砍断了指头、手膀。陈彭氏的大儿被抓去后，十五岁的小儿子躲在猪圈里，也被抓去了。
    子弟、丈夫被抓去后，我们有冤无处伸，有话无处说，死活无人管，幸亏有您们的英明领导，才把我们和我们的子弟丈夫解放出来，参加了人民解放军。去年人民政府才建立不久，各种条件还十分困难，就马上照顾我们，先后发放生活补助粮四万六千多斤，帮助我们安家。我们有一百多个孩子，由公家免费供给上学；患了病，公立医院给我们免费医治。我们中曾有一百多个人失业，由政府分别介绍了职业。今春土地改革中，我们住在郊区的一百八十户贫苦烈属、军属，每人都平均分到了四石二斗（每石一五零市斤）稻谷的土地。乡亲们待我们好得很，先把好地分给我们。对缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属，又采取包耕办法，自动为我们代耕，先把我们的田耕好了，才耕他们自己的。不但替我们耕好，还保证种好、收好、打好，亲自送到我们家里来，连一口茶都不让我们招待。现在地里红苕（即番薯）已栽完，苕藤长了一尺多长。田里秧子薅了两遍，苗子又肥又壮，早的已经在出穗了。每家烈属、军属，屋里堆着黄晶晶的包谷，现在吃的穿的都不愁了。军属胡杨氏从娘肚下地，就没吃过饱饭，解放前吃糠都捞不上嘴，现在分了地，杂粮、米饭不断顿，也能吃油吃盐了。
    在城区，政府除介绍职业外，还采取组织生产的办法，解决了我们生产的困难。街道居民都把优待我们列入爱国公约最重要的一项。从今年四月以来，大家纷纷捐款，献出或借出房屋、家具，帮助我们建立了十三个集体性的生产组织。现在营业很好，拿南坪场米粮店来说，三个月内净赚七百万元，店里六个人，每人分了一百多万元，不但家庭生活问题解决，还剩了钱，有的添了家具，有的添了新衣。
    现在，我们每个人都红光满面，门上挂着光荣匾，逢年过节大家都来祝贺。我们走路腰都是挺着的，再不是过去那样愁眉苦脸的了。军属萧竹泉六十四岁，当了三十多年穷小学教员，谁都瞧不起，说话没人听，现在当了区人民代表，能够在大庭广众间讲话了。
    我们决不辜负政府和群众这般的热爱。我们经常写信勉励在部队的子弟、丈夫，为保卫祖国、保卫我们的幸福日子，要好好的干。我们也决不落后，尽量的争取生产自给，减轻政府与群众的负担。去年全区六百五十六户烈属、军属，领政府生活补助费的有四百八十多户，今年春节已减少到二百零三户，端午节减少到三十七户，现在只有一户老弱的还需政府救济，其他都能自力更生了。我们烈属、军属在工作中已经出现了许多模范。成光华热心宣传抗美援朝，已成为宣传员。刘登夙协助公安机关镇压反革命，已被选为妇女武装队长。还有不少人被选为妇女代表或区、街人民代表。
    这都是您毛主席、朱总司令带给我们的光荣。如果没有共产党，没有您们的领导，我们那来这样荣耀的日子！我们已订了爱国公约，保证在您们的英明领导下，加倍地积极生产，虚心向群众学习，争取在各种工作中起模范作用。致最崇高的敬礼！
                     重庆市第五区六百五十六户烈属、军属上
            你们把我女儿培养成英雄
            我也要在全村争取当模范
            ——郭俊卿的妈妈的信敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    在庆祝“八一”建军节时，我万分感激你们把我的女儿郭俊卿培养成全国都爱戴的女战斗英雄。自从这里解放后，我过去这个讨过饭的穷老婆子，今天已经是有吃有穿，受人尊敬了。
    我现有二十四亩地，眼下村里正帮着给我盖新房。俊卿的部队还给我寄来过二十万元人民币的生活补助费。在耕种时政府白借给我一条犍牛使唤。逢年过节，政府、乡亲们又送肉送面，一切都照顾得十分周到。现在地里的秋苗长得很旺，都按时铲、趟过了。我没有一点困难。在俊卿的部队上寄来生活补助费时，她的弟弟感动地说：“我姐姐忠心给国家、人民立了功，争下了光荣，我也得好好学习她哩！”
    我们村里的人在抗美援朝运动中，认识都提高了一步，懂得把国家利益放在第一，家家户户都订了爱国公约。现全村正开展捐献飞机大炮运动，检查抚恤优待烈属、军属工作；在这些工作中，争取模范村。我也在全村里要争取当模范。
    毛主席、朱总司令！我用争取当模范的行动，祝你身体永远健康！祝你领导下的人民解放军个个成为保卫祖国的英雄！
        致
    最敬礼！
                     内蒙古自治区昭乌达盟巴林左翼旗太白庙村
                                   郭俊卿的妈妈宫宝霞上
                                                七月二十八日
