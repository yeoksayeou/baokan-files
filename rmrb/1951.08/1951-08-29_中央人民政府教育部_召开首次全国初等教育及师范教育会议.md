Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government
Convenes First National Conference on Elementary Education and Teacher Training
The conference will discuss how to consolidate and develop national elementary education and teacher training based on the specific conditions and needs of the new China.

The first National Conference on Elementary Education and Teacher Training, convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, opened in Beijing on the 27th. This conference was convened to discuss how to consolidate and develop national elementary education and teacher training based on the specific conditions and needs of the new China. Attending the conference were leading officials from educational administrative organs of the central government, major administrative regions, and some provinces and cities, as well as experienced primary school principals, kindergarten directors, nursery directors, normal school principals or directors of teaching affairs, normal university presidents, normal college presidents, specially invited experts in elementary education and teacher training, and representatives from relevant organs and organizations, totaling 350 people.

Minister of Education Ma Xulun delivered the opening speech at the conference. He pointed out that elementary education is the foundation of people's education. Improving the people's cultural level and cultivating talents for national construction depend on laying a solid foundation. Teacher training, for the cultivation and improvement of teachers at all levels, is the decisive key to whether the entire people's education undertaking can be well-managed and developed. Over the past two years, national elementary education has made great progress. Currently, there are 2,146 early childhood education institutions nationwide, with 145,900 children; 438,711 primary schools, with 35,872,667 students, exceeding the pre-war level. However, the number and capacity of elementary education institutions, especially primary schools, are still insufficient to meet the needs of the people. The quality of many primary schools is also still very poor. At the same time, elementary education funding is still very difficult, and the salaries of rural primary school teachers are very low, resulting in an unstable state of primary education in some areas. These problems need to be solved in a planned and step-by-step manner. As for teacher training, the direction and tasks of both higher normal schools and secondary normal schools are not clear, the departments and specialties of higher normal schools are mostly unreasonable, and the number of students is far from meeting the teacher requirements of schools at all levels. Some in-service teachers at all levels should also be trained and improved. Therefore, normal schools at all levels must be adjusted and developed. Finally, he emphasized that the new China is a revolutionary China, a people's China. We must use revolutionary spirit and rely on the people to overcome all difficulties, train a large number of teachers, and strive to educate the new generation.

Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council Guo Moruo also attended the meeting and spoke. He said that the basic policy of people's education in the new China is to serve the working class, farmers, and soldiers, and to open the door to them. In this regard, great achievements have been made in the past two years, such as the accelerated middle schools for workers and peasants, spare-time schools for workers and peasants, winter schools in rural areas, and the proportion of students from worker and peasant families in primary and secondary schools in some old revolutionary base areas has reached 80% of the total number. The Central People's Government values the achievements made by the hard work of over one million teachers. Therefore, the government is also very concerned about the salary issue of the vast number of rural primary school teachers. Although there cannot be a large increase at the present time, it must be improved under possible conditions. He said that these difficulties are temporary and can be gradually resolved. He called on government workers at all levels to value primary school teachers to promote and create a new social atmosphere of "respecting teachers and valuing education."

On the afternoon of the 27th, Vice Minister of Education Wei Que gave a report to the conference on "Consolidating and Developing Elementary Education and Teacher Training in the New China."

This conference will clearly define the direction and tasks of children's elementary education, determine the principles for raising and spending elementary education funds and appropriately improve the salaries of primary school teachers, determine the implementation steps for promoting the new elementary education system nationwide, determine the direction and tasks of normal schools of all levels and types, formulate a plan for the establishment of secondary normal schools nationwide and the principles for adjusting the establishment of higher normal schools, etc., and will make resolutions to be submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and implementation.

The conference is scheduled to last for half a month and will end around September 10. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　中央人民政府教育部
    召开首次全国初等教育及师范教育会议
    会议将讨论如何根据新中国的具体情况和需要，巩固和发展全国的初等教育及师范教育
    中央人民政府教育部召集的第一次全国初等教育及师范教育会议于二十七日在京开幕。这次会议是为讨论如何根据新中国的具体情况与需要，巩固和发展全国的初等教育和师范教育而召开的。出席会议的，有中央、各大行政区和一部分省市的教育行政机关的负责人及有经验的小学校长、幼儿园主任、托儿所长、师范学校校长或教导主任、师范大学校长、师范学院院长，特邀的初等教育和师范教育专家，各有关机关、团体的代表，共计三百五十人。
    会议由教育部部长马叙伦致开幕词。他指出：初等教育是人民的基础教育。提高人民文化水平，培养国家建设人才，均有赖于打好这个基础；师范教育对于各级师资的培养与提高，则是整个人民教育事业能否办好与能否发展的决定关键。两年以来，全国初等教育已有很大的发展，目前全国共有幼儿教育机关二千一百四十六所，儿童十四万五千九百人；小学四十三万八千七百十一所，学生三千五百八十七万二千六百六十七人，数字已超过战前水平。但是在全国初等教育机构特别是小学仍感数量少，容量小，远不能满足人民群众的需要；许多小学的质量也还很差。同时目前初等教育经费还很困难，农村小学教师待遇很低，以致造成某些地区小学教育不很稳定的状态。这些问题都需要作有计划有步骤的解决。至于师范教育则不论高等师范学校或中等师范学校的方针、任务都不明确，高等师范学校的科系设置，多不合理，学生数量也远不能满足各级学校的师资要求。各级学校一部分在职教师也应加以训练提高。因此各级师范学校都必须进行调整和发展。最后他强调指出：新中国是革命的中国，是人民的中国，我们必须用革命的精神，并依靠人民群众，来克服一切困难，大量培养师资，为教育新后代而努力。
    政务院副总理郭沫若也到会讲话。他说，新中国的人民教育的基本方针是：为工农大众服务，向工农大众开门。在这方面，两年来已有巨大的成绩，如全国各地举办的工农速成中学，工人、农民业余学校、农村冬学，以及部分老区中小学学生，工农子女已达到总人数的百分之八十。中央人民政府对百余万教师勤勤恳恳艰苦工作所做出的这些成绩是重视的。因此政府对广大的农村小学教师的待遇问题也很关心，在目前情况下，虽不能有大的提高，但一定要在可能的条件下加以改善。他说，这些困难都是一时的，也都能逐渐解决的。他号召各级政府工作人员要重视小学教师，以推动和造成新社会“尊师重道”的风气。
    二十七日下午，教育部副部长韦悫向会议作了“巩固和发展新中国的初等教育和师范教育”的报告。
    这次会议将明确规定儿童初等教育的方针和任务，确定初等教育经费的筹支原则和适当地改善小学教师的待遇，确定在全国范围内推行初等教育新学制的实施步骤，确定各级各类师范学校的方针和任务，拟定全国中等师范学校的设置计划与高等师范学校调整设置的原则等，并将作出决议呈请政务院批准后实施。
    会议预定举行半月，约在九月十日结束。    （新华社）
