　　Propaganda Work in the Increase Production and Donation Movement in Taihe County, Northern Anhui
    The increase production and donation movement has been widely and deeply carried out in Taihe County, Northern Anhui. A total of 176,580 households in the county have drawn up plans for increasing production and donations, accounting for more than 94 percent of the total number of households. The total value of increased production and increased income of each household can reach 7.56013 billion yuan, from which 2.16978 billion yuan will be donated to purchase aircraft and artillery. The implementation of these plans not only supported the front lines but also promoted the county's production work.
    This movement was launched after full publicity and education. The county held training courses for propagandists with more than 700 participants and convened a representative conference on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea with more than 600 participants. The Taihe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party fully led the representative conference on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. In addition to in-depth ideological education and conveying the principles and tasks of this movement, the conference organized representatives to repeatedly discuss and truly understand the significance of this movement. At the same time, the conference thoroughly studied methods for carrying out this movement, formulated detailed plans, and unified agreed on the time, steps, and practices for carrying out this movement. The conference also introduced typical experiences in mobilizing the masses to formulate increase production and donation plans. In the propaganda personnel training class, in addition to studying, each propaganda staff member drew up a plan, stipulating that after returning, they should first mobilize about 30 activists they were familiar with, organize them to use the "contracted publicity" method, and each person should carry out publicity and education to 30 to 50 people, so as to ensure that every one of the 830,000 people in the county received publicity and education.
    After returning to their hometowns, these trained backbone members formed an army of thousands of propaganda personnel. In addition to conducting oral propaganda, they also organized more than 12,000 folk artists and rural theater troupes in various townships to carry out various forms of literary and artistic propaganda; reading groups, broadcasting tubes, and blackboards in various villages also launched propaganda around this movement. At the same time, representatives of the delegation to North Korea made reports to more than 30,000 people in the county, which further strengthened the strength of this propaganda work.
    This large-scale propaganda work not only mobilized the people of the county to enthusiastically participate in the increase production and donation movement but also improved the political interest and learning enthusiasm of the broad masses. According to statistics from the Xinhua Bookstore in Taihe County, in the month and two days after the propaganda movement was launched, the average sales volume of books increased by 50 percent compared with the past. Farmers accounted for 70 percent of book buyers. The number of reading groups in various villages has more than doubled compared with the past. Some villages without literate people also subscribed to newspapers and took them to elementary schools more than a mile away to ask teachers to read them aloud.
    However, there are still some shortcomings and deviations in this movement. The main reason is that the movement was launched during the summer grain requisition period. The leadership did not convene district and township cadre meetings to carefully arrange the donation work and educate district and township cadres, but only gave them instructions. Therefore, some district and township cadres and representatives of the conference on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea did not cooperate well in their work; some cadres' work styles were not well rectified, resulting in some phenomena of coercion and commandism. These deviations still need to be thoroughly checked and corrected.

　　皖北太和县增产捐献运动中的宣传工作
    皖北太和县普遍深入地开展了增产捐献运动。全县有十七万六千五百八十户订出了增产捐献计划，占总户数的百分之九十四强。各户增加生产、增加收入的总值可达七十五亿六千零十三万余元，从中捐献二十一亿六千九百七十八万余元购买飞机大炮。这些计划的实施，不但支援了前线，而且推动了全县的生产工作。
    这一运动，是经过了充分的宣传教育之后开展起来的。全县曾举办了有七百多人参加的宣传人员训练班，召开了有六百多人参加的抗美援朝代表会议。中共太和县委以全力领导了这次抗美援朝代表会议。会上除了进行深入的思想教育，传达了这次运动的方针任务之外，并组织代表们反复讨论，使大家真正明白这次运动的意义，同时详细研究了回去开展这一运动的办法，订出了周密的计划，统一商定了开展这一运动的时间、步骤和做法。会上并介绍了发动群众订立增产捐献计划的典型经验。在宣传人员训练班里，除学习之外，到会宣传人员每人都订出了计划，规定回去后首先要动员自己熟悉的积极分子三十人左右，组织他们以“包干宣传”的办法，每人再向三十人至五十人进行宣传教育，务使全县八十三万人每一个人都受到宣传教育。
    这些受了训练的骨干分子回乡之后，组成了千军万马的宣传队伍。他们除了进行口头宣传之外，并组织一万二千多民间艺人和各乡的农村剧团，开展了各种文艺宣传；各乡村的读报组、广播筒、黑板报等，也围绕这一运动展开了宣传。与此同时，赴朝慰问团代表来县向三万多人作了传达报告，更增强了这次宣传工作的力量。
    这次大规模的宣传工作，不独发动全县人民热烈地投入了增产捐献运动，而且提高了广大群众的政治兴趣和学习情绪。据太和县新华书店统计，在宣传运动开展后的一个月零两天中，平均售书量比以前增加了百分之五十。买书人中农民占百分之七十。各村的读报组较以前增加了一倍多。有的村没有识字的人，他们也订了报纸，拿到一多里外的小学里请教员念给他们听。
    但这次运动中还有一些缺点与偏向，主要是运动开展时正值夏季征粮时间，领导上没有召开区乡干部会来周密布置捐献工作，并对区乡干部进行教育，只向他们作了指示，因此，有些区乡干部与抗美援朝会议的代表、宣传人员在工作中配合得不够好；某些干部的思想作风未能很好地整顿，因之发生了一些强迫命令的现象。这些偏向尚须深入检查纠正。      （巩固）
