The Benefits of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method
— Speech at the Qingdao Municipal Cotton Spinning Fine Yarn Worker Representative Conference
Chairman of the National Committee of the Textile Trade Union of China, Comrade Chen Shaomin

Comrades:

This is the first time for the textile trade union to hold a professional conference of this scale to summarize worker innovations and further promote advanced experiences. I hope that various regions can also convene professional conferences to summarize and promote advanced experiences.

The State-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory produced a Hao Jianxiu, who created a set of scientific fine yarn work methods. As a result, her top roller cotton waste averaged only 0.25% over seven months. This is a new record. The Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Trade Union and the Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, under the direct leadership of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spent three months summarizing and promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method, which has made significant achievements and gained experience in summarizing mass creations and promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method. The Hao Jianxiu work method will be promoted to all production departments of textile factories as a result of this conference. Qingdao's textile production will greatly improve. The Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, factory administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League attach such importance to mass creation and the promotion of advanced experiences, which is worthy of our learning.

What exactly is the Hao Jianxiu work method?

In summary, the basic content of the Hao Jianxiu work method has three points: First, work actively, regularly, planned, and with foresight. It is people who control the machines, not the machines that control people. This is known to everyone who has seen Hao Jianxiu's work. Although other workers have high labor intensity, staying close to the machines, and busily piecing broken ends, their work is passive, and people are controlled by the machines, so they are extremely tired. However, the top roller cotton waste is not reduced. Hao Jianxiu is different. She works according to a certain pattern and strives to be proactive in everything. For example, if a thread breaks behind her when she is patrolling, she does not come back to piece it immediately, but continues to work according to plan until she comes back around. Second, the movements are reasonable, which can also be said to be production rationalization. She combines several tasks together. While patrolling, she incidentally wipes the boards and sweeps the floor, while at the same time watching both sides, piecing broken ends when they appear, and changing the roving when it runs out. She does several jobs in one patrol, saving both effort and time. Third, she has grasped the main link of fine yarn work—cleaning. Because her work is regular and her movements are reasonable, she has time to do a good job of cleaning. She spends a lot of time on cleaning. When the cleaning is done well, there are fewer broken ends, less top roller cotton waste, higher output, and better quality.

The Hao Jianxiu work method is not only applicable to fine yarn production but also to other production departments.

What value has the Hao Jianxiu work method created?

The actual actions of Qingdao textile workers have proved that the Hao Jianxiu work method can create a large amount of wealth for the country.

(1) It increases production, saves raw materials, reduces costs, and extends the life of machines. In terms of increasing production alone, there are the following figures:

The top roller cotton waste rates of the nine textile factories in Qingdao (eight state-owned factories and the privately-owned Huaxin Yarn Factory) vary. Before the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method, the highest of the eight state-owned factories was Factory No. 2, at 2.715%; Factory No. 1 was 1.06%; and Factory No. 6 was the lowest, at only 0.89% (this is the average of two fine yarn workshops, the average of the entire Hao Jianxiu workshop was 0.67%). The average of the eight factories was about 1.66%. After the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method (August 1st to 10th), Factory No. 2 was still the highest, at 1.191% (the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method in this factory was later); Factory No. 1 was 0.525% (this factory was the first to learn the Hao Jianxiu work method); Factory No. 6 was the lowest, with an average of 0.497% for the entire factory, and the average of the eight factories was about 0.803%. Extrapolating from the ten-day results, Factory No. 6 can produce 182.3 more pieces of yarn in a year, and the eight factories can produce an average of 2,477 more pieces of yarn in a year. If the top roller cotton waste of all eight factories is reduced to the level of Factory No. 6, 3,529 more pieces of yarn can be produced in a year. If they can all reach the level of Hao Jianxiu, 4,256 more pieces of yarn can be produced in a year. In terms of the machines in the eight factories in Qingdao, Factory No. 6 has old machines that have been burned and are of medium quality among the eight textile factories. If the top roller cotton waste of Factory No. 6 can be reduced to 0.497%, other factories can also reduce it to this level as long as they do a good job of pre-spinning and maintenance. Hao Jianxiu's record of reducing top roller cotton waste should be the goal of all fine yarn workers in Qingdao.

The promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method in Qingdao has achieved remarkable results. If all the fine yarn workers in the country learn the Hao Jianxiu work method, the increase in production will be even more considerable. Assuming that all the fine yarn workers in the country learn the Hao Jianxiu work method, so that the average top roller cotton waste rate is reduced to the current average level in Qingdao (0.803%), 27,113 more pieces can be produced in a year. If the whole country can reach the level of Factory No. 6 (0.497%), 36,738 more pieces of yarn can be produced in a year; if the top roller cotton waste rate in the whole country can be the same as Hao Jianxiu's, 44,460 more pieces of yarn can be produced in a year. These numbers are very considerable. As long as the top roller cotton waste rate in the whole country is reduced to 0.803%, the surplus profits from increased production due to less top roller cotton waste can buy 50 fighter planes; if it can reach 0.497%, the surplus profits can buy 68 fighter planes. Sending these planes to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers will eliminate more invading troops. Can it be done? I believe that as long as the textile trade union organizations at all levels and the managers of textile enterprises truly understand the benefits of the Hao Jianxiu work method and earnestly promote it, the whole country can achieve a top roller cotton waste rate of 0.803% like Qingdao. If all cotton spinning mills can strengthen maintenance work and do a good job of pre-spinning work, the top roller cotton waste rate can be the same as that of the State-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory.

(2) It saves social labor and improves workers' ability to manage machines. Taking Factory No. 6 as an example, after the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method, only the pre-spinning process saved 14 work hours per 10,000 spindles in 10 hours due to the reduction of recycled cotton waste. If the Hao Jianxiu work method is promoted throughout the country, then even more work hours will be saved. Because the work is regular, the cleaning is done well, and there are fewer broken ends, the worker's ability to manage machines is naturally improved.

(3) The Hao Jianxiu work method is also applicable to pre-spinning, weaving, and maintenance. The workshops of the State-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory have achieved preliminary results in learning the Hao Jianxiu work method. For example, the Wang Jiaxiang team in the weaving workshop learned the Hao Jianxiu work method, the work has become regular, the output has increased, the rate of substandard cloth has been greatly reduced, and the waste silk has been reduced by 50%. The fine yarn machine cleaning team, according to the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu work method, combined with their own specific conditions, created a relatively complete work method, thus reducing the unnecessary walking distance by a quarter, and the time to clean a machine was reduced by 35%; and fatigue was reduced. The efficiency of the carding machine maintenance was increased by 20%. This shows that the Hao Jianxiu work method is not only applicable to fine yarn production but also to other production departments.

(4) It lays the foundation for setting quotas, thereby creating conditions for economic accounting. How was the Hao Jianxiu work method created? The Hao Jianxiu work method was created through long-term practice and is a concentrated expression of various advantages in the work of fine yarn workers, rather than being fabricated. Hao Jianxiu is a young female worker who has been trained under the new democratic regime and has less than two years of work experience. She was admitted to the State-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory in October 1949 to work as a trainee, and she was one of the trainees who made relatively rapid progress. After the three-month training period, she was in charge of 300 spindles. At that time, it was just before the Lunar New Year, and the first night shift after the New Year was Hao Jianxiu's first day as a formal worker. Hao Jianxiu, like other children, was playful during the day and did not sleep, and dozed off at night, causing large defects, and was criticized by everyone. However, Hao Jianxiu was not discouraged by this stimulus. She firmly remembered this lesson, used her brain, and strived to piece the ends well and no longer cause defects. In order not to doze off, she constantly patrolled the machines. During the patrol, she discovered that doing a good job of cleaning would reduce the number of broken ends, so she combined several jobs together, saving time to do cleaning. At the same time, she discovered that the work should be proactive and regular. In actual work, Hao Jianxiu believed that there were some unreasonable aspects in the old work method (such as doing cleaning work at fixed times). She broke the old rules, did cleaning work at any time, kept the wiping board in hand, and created a patrol routine.

Because Hao Jianxiu was a new worker with a low technical level, she learned from others at all times and absorbed their advantages, discarding her own shortcomings. After more than half a year, she finally created a set of scientific work methods. The emergence of the Hao Jianxiu work method was the result of struggle. When she created a record of reducing top roller cotton waste and was praised, she was ridiculed and envied by backward elements. However, Hao Jianxiu did not succumb to this and continued to work hard. With the encouragement and help of the factory's Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League, the Hao Jianxiu work method was finally accepted by other workers.

How was the Hao Jianxiu work method summarized and promoted?

After Hao Jianxiu created a record of reducing top roller cotton waste, it attracted the attention of the leaders of Factory No. 6, and they began to summarize Hao Jianxiu's experience in reducing top roller cotton waste, and the conclusion was: "Three Diligences and Three Quicks." After this summary was made, the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Trade Union promoted it, and the labor models of various factories actively learned the "Three Diligences and Three Quicks." As a result, the labor intensity increased, but the top roller cotton waste did not decrease. The labor models could not accept this experience and stopped learning. This summary was wrong, so the promotion work also failed. When the National Committee of the Textile Trade Union of China saw Hao Jianxiu's record of reducing top roller cotton waste and the summary of "Three Diligences and Three Quicks," it pointed out that the summary of "Three Diligences and Three Quicks" was wrong and required Qingdao to re-summarize it. The result of the second summary was still "Three Diligences and Three Quicks," but emphasized cleaning work. This summary still failed to correctly summarize Hao Jianxiu's experience in reducing top roller cotton waste. Later, a special committee was organized by the trade union and the administration to re-summarize it. The National Committee of the Textile Trade Union of China sent a special person to participate in the summary work. After measurement and research, a correct conclusion was reached in early June. Hao Jianxiu's practice was then elevated to theoretical principles, and everyone recognized that Hao Jianxiu had created a set of scientific fine yarn work methods, namely, the Hao Jianxiu work method.

After the Hao Jianxiu work method was summarized, a Hao Jianxiu work method promotion group was immediately organized, absorbing outstanding fine yarn workers and technicians to participate in the promotion work and to promote it to various factories. In the process of promotion, it encountered obstacles from certain conservative ideas. After Hao Jianxiu visited old workers as teachers and held Hao Jianxiu work method symposiums, the Hao Jianxiu work method was finally accepted by the majority of workers. The workers and masses realized the superiority of the Hao Jianxiu work method in practice. The Hao Jianxiu work method reduces the labor intensity for those who have a correct labor attitude, but it increases the labor intensity for those who are lazy. Therefore, even today, a few people need to first establish a correct labor attitude before they can understand the true meaning of the Hao Jianxiu work method.

The Qingdao Trade Union and the administration summarized and promoted the Hao Jianxiu work method, educated themselves, advanced the work, strengthened the relationship between the trade union and production, and the relationship with the masses, strengthened the relationship between the trade union and the administration, workers and technicians, changed the technicians' views of despising worker creations, broke the conservatism in the thinking of workers, and thus the prestige of both the trade union and the administration was improved. Textile trade union organizations at all levels and enterprise managers should humbly learn from their spirit and experience.

Comrades: The Hao Jianxiu work method is a valuable asset of our country. Textile workers across the country should break conservative thinking and study the Hao Jianxiu work method well, reduce top roller cotton waste, increase production, and contribute more to the motherland. Textile trade union organizations at all levels should systematically and rapidly promote the Hao Jianxiu work method throughout the country.

　　郝建秀工作法的好处
    ——在青岛市棉纺细纱职工代表会议上的讲话
    中国纺织工会全国委员会主席  陈少敏同志们：
    召开这样规模的专业会议，来总结工人创造，进一步推广先进经验，在纺织工会来说这还是第一次。希望各地也能召开专业会议来总结、推广先进经验。
    国营青岛第六棉纺织厂出了一位郝建秀，她创造了一套科学的细纱工作法。因此她的皮辊花七个月平均只有百分之○·二五。这是新纪录。纺织工会青岛市委员会和华东纺织管理局青岛分局，在中共青岛市委直接领导下，花了三个月的工夫，总结与推广郝建秀工作法，已做出重大成绩，并取得了总结群众创造、推广郝建秀工作法的经验。郝建秀工作法将因这次会议推广到纺织厂各个生产部门中去。青岛的纺织生产将会大大提高一步。青岛市的党委、工厂行政、工会、青年团这样重视群众创造，推广先进经验，是值得我们学习的。
  郝建秀工作法到底是怎样的呢？
    总括起来说，郝建秀工作法的基本内容有三点：第一、工作主动，有规律，有计划，有预见性。是人支配机器，不是机器支配人。这是看过郝建秀工作的人都知道的。其他工人同志劳动强度虽然高，人不离车档，来回忙接头，工作处于被动，人被机器支配，累得不得了。可是皮辊花并未减少。郝建秀则不然，她按照一定的规律工作，一切争取主动。譬如她巡回时后面断了头，她并不回来接，仍然按计划进行工作，直到回来时再接。第二、动作合理，也可以说是生产合理化。她把几种工作结合起来做。在巡回时就附带打擦板、扫地，同时眼睛看到两面，断了头就接，粗纱完了就换。巡回一次做了几种工作，既省力气又省时间。第三、她抓住了细纱工作的主要环节——清洁工作。因她工作有规律，动作合理，她就有时间做好清洁工作。在清洁工作上她花的时间很多。清洁工作做好了，断头就少，皮辊花出的少，产量就高，质量就好。
    郝建秀工作法不仅适用于细纱生产方面，同时也适用于其他生产部门。
  郝建秀工作法创造了什么价值呢？
    青岛纺织工人的实际行动证明了，郝建秀工作法能为国家创造大量财富。
    （一）使生产增加，原料节约，成本降低，机器寿命延长。单就增加产量来说就有下列数字：
    青岛九个纺织厂（国营八个厂及私营华新纱厂）皮辊花率高低不一。推广郝建秀工作法前，国营八个厂中以二厂为最高，为百分之二·七一五，一厂百分之一·○六，六厂最低，仅百分之○·八九（这是两个细纱间的平均数，郝建秀车间全车间平均百分之○·六七）。八个厂平均约为百分之一·六六。推广郝建秀工作法后（八月一号至十号），二厂仍最高，为百分之一·一九一（该厂推广郝建秀工作法迟些）；一厂百分之○·五二五（该厂首先学郝建秀工作法）；六厂最低，全厂平均为百分之○·四九七，八个厂平均约为百分之○·八○三。以十天成绩推算，六厂一年可以多产一八二·三件纱，八个厂平均一年可以多产二千四百七十七件纱，假若八个厂皮辊花都降到六厂水平，一年可以多产三千五百二十九件纱。如果都能达到郝建秀的水平，一年可以多产四千二百五十六件纱。按青岛八个厂机器来说，六厂是火烧过的老机器，在八个纺织厂中是中等机器。六厂的皮辊花能降到百分之○·四九七，其他厂只要作好前纺工作和保全工作，也可以降到这个水平。郝建秀少出皮辊花的纪录，应该作为青岛全体细纱工人的奋斗目标。
    青岛推广郝建秀工作法收到了显著成绩。如果全国细纱工人都学习郝建秀工作法，增产数字就更可观了。假设全国细纱职工学习郝建秀工作法，使皮辊花率平均降低到青岛今天的平均水平（百分之○·八○三），一年可以多产二万七千一百一十三件。假若全国都能达到六厂的水平（百分之○·四九七，）一年可以多产三万六千七百三十八件纱；假若全国皮辊花率能和郝建秀一样，一年可多产四万四千四百六十件纱。这些数字是很可观的，只要全国皮辊花率降低到百分之○·八○三，那么因少出皮辊花增加生产的超额利润就可以买五十架战斗机；假若能达到百分之○·四九七，则超额利润可以买六十八架战斗机。把这些飞机去支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，就会消灭更多的侵略军。能不能做到呢？我认为只要纺织工会各级组织和纺织企业管理者真正体会到郝建秀工作法的好处，切实推广，全国都可以和青岛一样作到百分之○·八○三的皮辊花率。如果各棉纺厂都能加强保全工作，做好前纺工作，皮辊花率是可以和国营青岛第六棉纺织厂看齐的。
    （二）节省社会劳动力，提高工人看台能力。以六厂为例，推广郝建秀工作法后，每万锭十小时仅前纺因减少回花即节约十四个工时。如果在全国推广郝建秀工作法，那么节约的工时就更多了。因工作有规律，清洁工作做得好，断头少，工人的看台能力自然提高。
    （三）郝建秀工作法也适用于前纺、织布和保全。国营青岛第六棉纺织厂各车间学习郝建秀工作法，已经取得了初步成绩。如布场王家祥小组学习了郝建秀工作法，工作有了规律，产量提高，次布率大大降低，回丝减少了百分之五十。细纱揩车组根据郝建秀工作法的精神，结合自己的具体情况，创造了一套比较完整的工作法，因此少走四分之一的冤枉路，揩一台车的时间减少了百分之三十五；而且减少了疲劳。梳棉保全提高效率百分之二十。这说明郝建秀工作法不仅适用于细纱生产方面，而且适用于其他生产部门。
    （四）为定额打下基础，从而给经济核算创造了条件。郝建秀工作法是怎样创出来的？郝建秀工作法是经过长期实践创造出来的，是细纱工人工作中各种优点的集中表现，而不是臆造出来的。郝建秀是新民主主义政权下培养出来的一位工龄不满两年的青年女工。她于一九四九年十月考入国营青岛第六棉纺织厂做养成工，她是这批养成工中进步比较快的一个。三个月学习期满就看三百锭子。那时恰值旧历年关，旧年后第一个夜班就是郝建秀做正式工人的第一天。郝建秀和别的孩子一样白天贪玩，不睡觉，夜里打盹，放了大花，受到了大家的批评。但是郝建秀并未因这个刺激而灰心，她牢牢记住这个教训，开动脑筋，争取把头接好，不再放花。为了不再打盹，就不断巡回车档，在巡回中她发现了做好清洁工作，就少断头，于是她就把几种工作结合起来做，省出时间做清洁工作。同时她发现工作要主动要有规律。郝建秀在实际工作中认为旧工作法中有某些不合理之处（如定时做清洁工作）。她打破了旧规矩，随时做清洁工作，擦板不离手，而创造了巡回规律。
    郝建秀因为自己是新工人，技术水平低，她时时刻刻向别人学习，并吸收别人的优点，扬弃自己的缺点。经过了半年多，终于创造了一套科学的工作法。郝建秀工作法的产生是经过斗争的，当她创造了少出皮辊花的纪录受到表扬时，曾遭到落后分子的讽刺、嫉妒。但是郝建秀并未因此而屈服，仍继续努力。加以该厂党、政、工、团的鼓励和帮助，郝建秀工作法终于被其他工人接受了。
  郝建秀工作法是怎样总结与推广的？
    郝建秀创造了少出皮辊花的纪录后，引起了六厂领导上的注意，他们开始总结郝建秀少出皮辊花的经验，结论是：“三勤三快”。这个总结做出后，纺织工会青岛市委员会曾加以推广，各厂劳动模范曾积极学习“三勤三快”。结果增加了劳动强度，皮辊花并未减少。劳动模范们接受不了这个经验而终止学习。这个总结是错误的，因而推广工作也失败了。中国纺织工会全国委员会看到郝建秀少出皮辊花的纪录和“三勤三快”的总结时，就指出“三勤三快”的总结是错误的，要求青岛重新总结。第二次总结的结果，仍旧是“三勤三快”，不过着重指出了清洁工作。这一次总结还是未能把郝建秀少出皮辊花的经验正确地总结出来。以后又由工会、行政组织了专门委员会重新总结。纺织工会全国委员会派专人参加总结工作。经过了测定、研究，于六月初得出了正确的结论。郝建秀的实践才被提到理论原则上来，大家才公认郝建秀创造了一套科学的细纱工作法，即郝建秀工作法。
    郝建秀工作法总结出来以后，随即组织了郝建秀工作法推广组，吸收优秀细纱工人、技术人员参加推广工作，到各厂推广。在推广过程中又遇到了某些保守思想的阻碍。经过郝建秀向老工人拜老师，郝建秀工作法座谈会等工作，郝建秀工作法终于被广大职工所接受。职工群众在实践中体会到了郝建秀工作法的优越性。郝建秀工作法对那些有正确的劳动态度的人是降低劳动强度，但对那些偷懒的人是提高劳动强度。所以，直到今天，还有少数人需要首先树立正确的劳动态度，才能体会到郝建秀工作法的真实意义。
    青岛工会、行政总结推广郝建秀工作法，教育了自己，把工作推进了一步，密切了工会和生产的关系，和群众的关系，密切了工会和行政，工人和技术人员的关系，改变了技术人员轻视工人创造的观点，打破了职工思想中的保守性，因而工会和行政的威信都提高了。纺织工会各级组织和企业管理者应虚心学习他们这种精神和经验。
    同志们：郝建秀工作法是我们国家的宝贵财富。全国纺织工人应打破保守思想好好学习郝建秀工作法，减少皮辊花，增加生产，为祖国贡献更大的力量。纺织工会各级组织应有计划地把郝建秀工作法在全国迅速推广。
