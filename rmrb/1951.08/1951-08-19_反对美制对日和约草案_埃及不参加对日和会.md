　　Opposing the U.S.-Drafted Treaty of Peace with Japan
    Egypt Will Not Attend the San Francisco Peace Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 18th] TASS, Cairo, August 18th: According to a report in "Al-Ahram": The Egyptian government has no intention of sending representatives to the San Francisco conference to discuss the treaty of peace with Japan. The newspaper said that the Egyptian Foreign Minister informed the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt that Egypt will not participate in the San Francisco Peace Conference and does not wish to send representatives because it does not approve of the U.S.-drafted treaty of peace with Japan. The newspaper pointed out that Egyptian figures particularly emphasized the clause in the treaty regarding allowing U.S. occupation forces to remain stationed in Japan. Egypt believes that adopting this clause is equivalent to tacitly approving the principle that foreign troops can use defense as an excuse to occupy any country.

　　反对美制对日和约草案
    埃及不参加对日和会
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社开罗十八日电，据《金字塔报》消息：埃及政府无意派遣代表参加旧金山会议，讨论对日和约。该报说，埃及外交大臣通知美国驻埃及大使称，埃及将不参加旧金山对日和会，并不愿派遣代表，因为它不赞成美制对日和约草案。该报指出，埃及人士特别强调指出和约中关于容许美国占领军留驻日本的条款。埃及认为，采用这一条款，等于默认外国军队可以用防卫为借口来占领任何国家的原则。
