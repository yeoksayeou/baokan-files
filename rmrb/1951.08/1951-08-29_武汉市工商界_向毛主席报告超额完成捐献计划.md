　　Wuhan Industrial and Commercial Circles
    Report to Chairman Mao on Overfulfilling Donation Plan
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 28th] The Wuhan industrial and commercial circles sent a telegram to Chairman Mao reporting the overfulfillment of the donation plan. The original telegram is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:
    Through political study, we, the Wuhan industrial and commercial circles, have universally received patriotic ideological education. In this patriotic production increase and weapon donation campaign, under the leadership and support of the working class, we have responded to the call with practical actions and have achieved initial results. The total donation plan has reached 64.341 billion 50,000 yuan RMB, equivalent to approximately 43 fighter planes, exceeding the original target of 30 planes set in the second expanded meeting of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. In the practice of payment, all industries have strived to make collective payments. The planned amount for deposit in July has now been overfulfilled, and several industries have collectively paid the donation for August. A total of 9.725 billion yuan has been paid, laying a solid foundation for the complete fulfillment of the glorious patriotic donation task. The attainment of this initial achievement is a concrete manifestation of the Wuhan industrial and commercial circles' love for the people's motherland and the people's leader. This enthusiastic situation is inseparable from the great victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause led by you. In order to further deepen the patriotic production increase and weapon donation campaign and ensure the completion of the payment task on schedule, the Industrial and Commercial Federation branch of the Wuhan Municipal Patriotic Production Increase and Weapon Donation Committee convened a comprehensive representative conference on the morning of August 23rd and the afternoon of August 24th. It examined the advantages and disadvantages of the work progress, inspired and encouraged the in-depth development of the movement, and discussed the methods for implementing the plan and making payments on schedule. After unanimous resolution by all attending representatives, it was decided to complete the donation payment task for the previous month before the 10th of each month according to the established plan, and to guarantee the completion of the glorious task of donating 43 fighter planes before December of this year. We guarantee that under your wise leadership, we will continue to work hard to victoriously complete this glorious patriotic donation task.
    We offer our highest respect.
     Representative Conference of the Industrial and Commercial Federation Branch of the Wuhan Municipal Patriotic Production Increase and Weapon Donation Committee
        Respectfully submitted on the 24th
