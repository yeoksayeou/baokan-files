　　[This Newspaper Reported] The upcoming first North China County Head Conference is a major event in the political life of the people of North China. The People's Government of Pingyuan Province and the special commissioner's offices and county governments of the province have placed preparations for the conference as one of the most important items on their agenda.
    In mid-July, the People's Government of Pingyuan Province organized two working groups to assist Anyang and Puyang, two key counties, in systematically summarizing their political construction work. At the end of July and the beginning of August, the county heads of Jiyuan, Nanwang, and Junxian counties, as well as the Civil Affairs Section Chief of the Hubei Special Commissioner's Office, were successively transferred to the Provincial Government to report on political construction and preferential treatment work.
    The province-wide political construction summary work is currently underway. Except for some counties where waterlogging has caused disasters and a large number of cadres have gone to the countryside to dredge water, postponing the study and summary of political construction documents, most counties have attached importance to this work. For example, the Xinxiang Special Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of county civil affairs section chiefs in mid-July to study specific methods based on the instructions of the Provincial Government. After the meeting, the counties generally discussed the instructions of the Provincial People's Government and the special districts at enlarged cadre meetings. After the Anyang Special Commissioner's Office instructed the counties to attach importance to the preparation for the North China County Head Conference, the Anyang County Head personally led the study and summary work, and extracted five cadres to form a temporary office to specifically promote this work. At the same time, the county, during the study and inspection work, focused on convening representatives from all walks of life and section chiefs, bureau chiefs, and district heads to discuss political construction work, extensively collected opinions from all parties, and enriched the content of the work summary.
    In order to better summarize the work, the province is studying political construction documents and examining the main problems existing in the political construction work (namely, the understanding of the people's representative conference as the fundamental system of state power). In terms of learning methods, the most effective is when the special commissioner and county head personally preside over and organize cadres above the section chief level (including political and legal departments) to study and discuss on their own. For example, after the section and bureau chiefs of Jiyuan and Wuzhi counties collectively studied for four to six days, they gathered the materials, made enlightening reports to all cadres, and then conducted group discussions. As a result, the cadres' understanding of political construction work has been improved, and the summary is relatively comprehensive and the viewpoints are more correct. Secondly, the focus is on cadres above the section chief level, with emphasis on group learning. Therefore, leading cadres cannot conduct good collective research, resulting in the failure to combine learning and summary work well. The Puyang Special Commissioner's Office and some counties of other special commissioner's offices have this shortcoming in their learning. In addition, some special districts or counties only regard this study as routine business, learning for two hours a day, resulting in poor results and a generalized work summary. But in general, through this study and inspection of political construction documents, the cadres' understanding of political construction work has been improved one step further. They have generally clarified that the people's democratic dictatorship includes both democracy within the people and dictatorship over reactionaries, correcting the previous erroneous view that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was only the work of public security and judicial departments; they have recognized the important role of politics in promoting economic development; and they have recognized that it is wrong to bury oneself in business and not ask about politics. For example, the cadres in Wen County and the Jiaozuo mining area reflected: although they had held several people's representative conferences in the past, they did not realize that it was the fundamental system of the country. After studying the documents, their thinking became much clearer. Some county leaders have not attached importance to the preparation work for the North China County Head Conference, and have pushed the study of political construction documents and work summary to the civil affairs departments. Individual cities and counties emphasized that they were busy with work and ignored the instructions of the higher authorities. For example, the Xinxiang Municipal People's Government had not studied and prepared until August 15th, and even the instructions from the higher authorities could not be found. The leaders of Anyang City had insufficient understanding of the people's representative conference as the fundamental system of the country (only three enlarged consultative committees were held this year, and no people's representative conference was held). After the instructions were issued this time, the city's administrative meeting did not study it and pushed it to the civil affairs department to do it. This work attitude of not studying or implementing important instructions from the higher authorities and not caring about the current political life of the people is wrong and should be corrected.

　　平原省人民政府和各专署、县政府
    积极准备参加华北县长会议
    正认真学习和总结建政工作
    【本报讯】行将召开的华北首次县长会议是华北人民政治生活中的一件大事，平原省人民政府和该省各专署、县政府已将会议的准备工作列为最重要的议事日程之一。
    七月中旬，平原省人民政府组织了两个工作组，分别帮助安阳、濮县两个重点县进行了建政工作的系统总结；七月底和八月初，先后抽调了济源、南旺、浚县等三县县长及湖西专署民政科长，来省府汇报建政工作和优抚工作。
    该省全省的建政总结工作现正在进行。除部分县因积水成灾，大批干部下乡疏水，推迟了建政文件的学习和总结外，一般的都重视了这一工作。如新乡专署于七月中旬召开了县民政科长会议，根据省府指示，研究了具体作法；会后，各县一般都在扩大干部会议上讨论了省人民政府和专区的指示。安阳专署指示各县重视华北县长会议的准备工作后，安阳县长亲自领导学习和总结工作，并抽出五个干部组成临时办公室，专门推动这一工作；同时，该县在学习与检查工作中，有重点地召集各界代表及各科长、局长、区长座谈建政工作，广泛搜集了各方面的意见，充实了工作总结的内容。
    为了更好地总结工作，该省正在学习建政文件，检查建政工作中存在的主要问题（即对人民代表会议是国家政权的根本制度的认识问题）。在学习方式上，收效最大的，是由专员、县长亲自主持，组织科长以上干部（包括政法部门）自学与讨论。如济源、武陟两县的科、局长集体学习四至六天后，把材料集中起来，向全体干部作启发报告，然后分组讨论。这样作的结果，提高了干部的对建政工作的认识，总结也就比较全面，观点比较正确。其次，是以科长以上干部为主，偏重分组学习，因此，领导干部不能很好的集体研究，致学习与总结工作不能很好结合，濮阳专署及其他专署的部分县在学习中就有此缺点。另外，有些专区或县只是把这种学习当成日常业务，每日学习两小时，效果较差，工作总结表现一般化。但总的说来通过这次建政文件的学习和检查工作，干部对建政工作的认识是提高了一步，普遍明确了人民民主专政是包括对人民内部的民主和对反动派的专政两方面，纠正了以往认为镇压反革命只是公安、司法部门的工作的错误看法；认识了政治推动经济发展的重要作用；认识了埋头搞业务不问政治是不对的。如温县及焦作矿区的干部反映：过去虽开过几次各界人民代表会议，但没认识到它是国家的根本制度，在学习了文件以后思想就亮多了。尚有少数县份的领导，未重视参加华北县长会议的准备工作，把建政文件的学习和工作总结，推给民政部门去作。个别市、县强调工作忙，对上级的指示置之不理。如新乡市人民政府，拖至八月十五日尚未研究和准备，甚至连上级的指示文件也找不到了。安阳市领导上对各界人民代表会议是国家根本制度的认识不足（今年只召开了三次扩大协商委员会，而未召开各界人民代表会议），此次指示下达后，该市行政会议未作研究即推给了民政部门去作。这种对上级重要指示不研究不执行，对当前人民的政治生活不关心的工作态度，是错误的，应予纠正。
