　　The Militarization of the American Economy
    Laszlo Hai
    It has been more than a year since the American imperialists launched their attack on the Korean people. During this period, profound changes have taken place in the American economy. Monopoly capital is doing its utmost to put the American economy on a war economy track. For the big capitalists, war preparations mean huge profits; for the working people, war preparations mean a continuous decline in living standards. For example, in the first quarter of 1951, the profits of 550 large companies were 30 percent higher than in the same quarter of 1950. According to incomplete materials, the standard of living decreased by 13.8 percent during the same period (although wages increased somewhat, this increase could not offset the ever-increasing costs).
    What is the future of the militarization of the American economy? What will be the result? To answer this question, we must look at what Comrade Stalin said about the war economy of capitalist countries. At the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Comrade Stalin said:
    "...Putting the domestic economy on a war economy track means developing industry along a one-sided military trend, vigorously expanding the production of items exclusively for war needs and unrelated to residents' consumption, vigorously reducing the production of residents' consumer goods, especially reducing the sale of residents' consumer goods, thereby reducing residents' consumption and plunging the country into an economic crisis."
    The experience of the past ten years and more has fully confirmed Comrade Stalin's words. A one-sided, military trend in the economy will inevitably promote the reduction of production, especially the reduction of the output of consumer goods supplied to the market, the reduction of consumption, and ultimately, undoubtedly, the economic crisis.

            I
    Let's take a closer look at the state of the American economy today.
    In the six months after the start of the Korean War, the demand for industrial manufactures and means of production soared. In the first quarter of 1951, the average industrial production increased by 20 percent compared to the first quarter of 1950, primarily because of the increase in military production. The production of consumer goods, that is, the production of light industrial products, increased much less. In the following months, there was no noticeable increase in the production of light industry, although its production level was still far below that of 1943-44.
    At the same time, the amount of military orders greatly increased, recently skyrocketing to as much as six billion U.S. dollars per month. The expansion of military production has now reached a climax. In the fiscal year from July 1, 1951, to June 30, 1952, Truman plans to allocate 60.7 billion U.S. dollars for military expenses and 8.5 billion U.S. dollars for arming vassal states. These estimated expenses are equal to half of the annual wages of American factories and agencies. From this figure, it can be seen the extent to which real wages are reduced by extracting this large sum of money from the working people. More than half of this military expenditure is spent in the form of industrial orders. From this, it can be seen that although this is not all military orders, and although the output of military industry has not reached its peak, a large part of American industry is already manufacturing armaments. According to the magazine "Iron Age," 70 percent of steel rolling is designated for military orders related to armament plans.
    In order to accelerate the expansion of military industry, the Washington government gives this large sum of money scraped from the tax-paying public to the monopoly capitalists. The U.S. government uses tax preference methods to guarantee that money invested in military industry will be returned within five years, or even less than five years. All private credit loans used to develop military industry are guaranteed by the government, and the government itself also lends money to capitalist enterprises. Because of these measures, the total amount of investment in industry in 1951 will be nearly 30 percent higher than last year's level.
    Which industries does the Washington government want to use these investments to increase the output of? The first on the list is "transportation equipment," with a production increase of 38 percent. The "transportation equipment" stipulated to be increased includes airplanes, tanks, armored vehicles, tractors and warships necessary for military use. Second is the automobile manufacturing industry, with an increase of 17 percent. The output of electrical machinery supplying the needs of the military industry is stipulated to increase by 14 percent. The chemical industry is to increase by 11 percent; the machine manufacturing industry by 10 percent; and steel output by 10 percent. It is worth noting that about 51 percent of the investment necessary to increase the production of "transportation equipment" is provided by the government.
    One of the prerequisites for expanding military industry is to increase the number of machines. American machine tool manufacturers have received so many orders that, at their current production level, it would take 20 months to fulfill them. Therefore, in the third quarter of this year, the steel allocated to machine tool manufacturers increased by 40 percent compared to the consumption in the first quarter of this year; copper by 30 percent; and aluminum by 25 percent.

            II
    Where does the U.S. government get the funds to use for this insane armament expenditure? The May bulletin of a large bank, "Guaranty Trust Company," gives an answer to this question. This bulletin concludes: "The inevitable result seems to be -- shrinking personal consumption." The May bulletin of another large bank estimates that in the next two and a half years, civilian consumption will be less than in 1950. By the end of this year, civilian production will be reduced even more than previously expected.
    The inflation caused by the decline in the purchasing power of the working people has greatly reduced their living standards. The main reason for the continuous inflation is the budget imbalance caused by huge military expenditures. Capitalists are engaged in large-scale speculation. Bank commercial credit loans have increased to the extent that they are neither commensurate with production nor with existing reserves. Moreover, because of the prevalence of speculation, financial turnover has also greatly accelerated. Indeed, banks are now trying to recover some credit loans, but at the same time, the budget is also running a deficit, which is currently estimated to be 16 billion yuan. In the coming months of this year and next year, the deficit situation will be even worse than in the past. By that time, military production must have increased, and the government's orders for military supplies must be manufactured on a larger scale, and the national treasury must pay more money. Therefore, the road leading to more serious inflation has been completely built. Inflation has another effect: it makes war preparations more expensive. In this regard, the words of Wilson, the head of the war economy, are worth noting. He said that for every 10 billion yuan allocated by Congress for military expenditures, 2 billion yuan is lost due to inflation.
    For this very reason, American monopoly capital is linking inflation with price controls. Price controls, on the one hand, make it easier for monopoly capital to increase profits, and on the other hand, further reduce the living standards of the working people. This can be clearly seen from the price control regulations announced at the end of April. These regulations apply to many items, but not to raw materials, machinery, and necessities for military industry. The purpose of the regulations is obvious -- to give monopoly capital more opportunities to profit. On the other hand, these regulations do not apply to food and other major consumer goods. The purpose of doing so is to use prices to transfer most of the burden of military expenses to the shoulders of the working people. Wage freezes are also a way to achieve this goal, and capitalists are using this method to prevent wages from increasing with rising prices.

            III
    Monopoly capital is using military economic agencies to implement its policies, and the heads of military economic agencies are the masters of large monopoly capital. Here are a few examples: Wilson, the general manager of General Electric, is the director of the U.S. Military Production Bureau. No wonder the company's profits increased to the staggering figure of 834 million yuan in 1950. Of Wilson's three main assistants, one also represents General Electric, and two represent large mining companies. All of these companies are within the sphere of influence of Morgan Bank. Jiang Shidun, the director of the Economic Stabilization Bureau, is a big boss in the film industry. The director of the Wage Stabilization Bureau is a director of the American Rubber Trust (within the sphere of influence of the DuPont family). Because the distribution of orders and materials is handled by monopoly capital, it is difficult for small businesses to receive orders. They cannot get the main raw materials, so they have to drastically reduce production or simply close down. On the contrary, the profits of monopoly capital have soared to an alarming extent. For example, enterprises that manufacture "transportation equipment" (that is, armaments) increased their profits by 95 percent compared to last year. The profits of oil refining enterprises rose by 50 percent. The profits of mining companies rose by 45 percent.
    This policy guarantees monopoly capital receives incredibly high profits, while greatly reducing the purchasing power of the working people. There are no buyers for the goods produced for mass consumption. Therefore, the unsold inventory in stores and various factories is accumulating more and more. In April, the inventory of various goods exceeded last year's level by 20 percent. At the beginning of this year, inventory continued to accumulate. In 350 stores, the inventory of all telecopiers and radios doubled within a year. Carpets increased by 60 percent, general major household appliances by 91 percent, hosiery by 40 percent, wool felt by 71 percent, toys by 76 percent, and sports equipment by 45 percent. At the same time, the sales volume of retail trade, taking price increases into account, was less in March and April of this year than in March and April of last year. In the first four months of this year, industrial inventory increased by 10 percent. In April, industrial orders received were 17 percent less than in March, although military orders continued to increase. So, it is clear that the demand for consumer goods is constantly decreasing. Many industries are overproducing, which is the case in the textile industry, the shoe industry, the furniture industry, and in the industries manufacturing telecopiers, radios, electric refrigerators, washing machines, stoves, etc. The people's living standards have been greatly reduced, although the United States has not yet fully and clearly transitioned to a war economy.
    The unemployment caused by the local crisis is increasing in many industries. The number of people working shorter hours is also increasing. Recently, Ford, General Motors, and other automobile companies, as well as enterprises manufacturing mass consumer goods, have laid off hundreds of thousands of workers. Some factory workers work only four days a week.
    The reduction in consumption makes inventory difficult to sell, which has created a situation where people who do business on a large amount of credit loans now have almost no way to repay their debts. As a result, industry is also suffering from financial difficulties. These factors have caused a large reduction in bank deposits. From mid-April to mid-May, bank deposits in New York and Chicago decreased by 24 percent, and decreased by 20 percent in other cities. Due to the unstable situation, credit loans are difficult to obtain. This is a common phenomenon during the period of overproduction in capitalist countries. There are few credit loans, and interest rates are getting higher and higher. Banks are forcing borrowers to repay loans and liquidate deposits. This phenomenon has been observed in the United States in recent weeks. It is worth noting that major department stores in New York have announced many goods "on sale" in order to reduce debts and avoid bankruptcy. These "sales" clearly expose the contradictions caused by the transition to a war economy, and the contradictions caused by the development of one-sided military production and the restriction of civilian consumption.

            IV
    At present, when heavy industry has received tens of billions of yuan in large military orders and more orders later, the overproduction in certain industrial sectors is not enough to directly lead the United States to a total crisis of overproduction. However, with the development of military industry, the allocation of civilian consumer goods and means of production is becoming narrower and narrower. Starting from the third quarter of this year, the agencies in charge of managing the military economy have restricted the use of steel, copper, and aluminum used in the manufacture of consumer goods even more severely. In the third quarter of this year, the production of passenger cars will decrease by 37 percent compared to the same quarter last year, and housing construction will decrease by 43 percent. It can be concluded that production for personal consumption will continue to decrease month by month. As a result, the contradictions caused by this will expand, and inevitably lead to an economic crisis. American monopoly capital wants to launch a world war to escape this crisis. It is now busy preparing for this war.
    At the same time, class contradictions are also becoming more and more acute. The American working class did not experience serious hardship in the two world wars, but in the year since the outbreak of the Korean War, the American working people themselves have seen that the imperialist war makers are making this bloody adventure at the expense of the interests of the working people. Even the bourgeois newspapers have had to admit that the American working class's resistance is getting higher and higher. This can be seen in the general strike movement. American monopoly capital's use of deprivation of freedom, terror, and fascist methods to undermine workers' struggles for life has been fruitless. Strikes have proved that the heavy burden imposed on the American working people by the huge military expenditures and the aggressive war in Korea only results in more intense class struggles in the United States.
    All these factors prove that the militarization of the American economy is leading the country towards an economic crisis. And it can be expected that this crisis will be even more severe than the United States has experienced in the past. The imperialists want to launch a new world war to escape this crisis. The more acute the contradictions of capitalism are, the more frequently the imperialists take risks. This makes it more important to strengthen the people's struggle for peace.

　　美国经济的军事化
    拉兹罗·海
    自从美帝国主义者向朝鲜人民发动进攻以来已经一年多了。在这时期里，美国在经济上发生了深刻的变化。独占资本正在极力把美国经济转上战时经济轨道。对于大资本家，战争准备就是巨大的利润；对于劳动人民，战争准备就是不断降低的生活水准。例如，在一九五一年的第一季，五百五十家大公司的利润比一九五○年同一季高出百分之三十。根据不完全的材料，生活水准在同时期降低了百分之一三点八（虽然工资增加了一些，可是这个增加抵不上不断上涨的费用）。
    美国经济军事化的前途是怎样的？会有什么结果？要回答这问题，必须看看斯大林同志对资本主义国家的战时经济所说的话。在联共（布）第十八次党代表大会上斯大林同志说：
    “……把国内经济转上战时经济轨道，就是使工业循着片面的军事的趋向发展，极力扩大专供战争需要而与居民消费无关的那些物品的生产，极力缩小居民消费品的生产，特别是缩小居民消费品的出售，因而缩减居民的消费额，使国家陷入经济危机。”
    后来十几年的经验充分证实了斯大林同志的话。经济上片面的、军事的趋向，必然促成生产的缩小，特别是供应市场的消费品产量的缩小，促成消费额的减缩，最后无疑地促成经济危机。
            一
    让我们更仔细地看一看今天美国经济的状况吧。
    在朝鲜战事开始后的六个月中，工业制造品和生产品的需要激增。在一九五一年第一季，工业的生产额平均比一九五○年第一季的水平增加了百分之二十，这首先是因为军事生产额增加了。消费品的生产额，也就是轻工业生产品的生产额，就增加得比较少得多。在以后几个月里，轻工业的生产额就看不出有什么增加，虽然它的生产水平还远在一九四三至四四年之下。
    同时，军事定货的数量大为增加，最近飞涨到每月六十亿美元之多。军事生产的扩张现在已经到了高潮。从一九五一年七月一日到一九五二年六月三十日这个会计年度里，杜鲁门预计要拨款六百零七亿美元作为军事费用，八十五亿美元作为武装附庸国家之用。这些预计的费用抵得上美国工厂和机关每年工资的半数。从这个数字可以看出，由于榨取劳动人民这大笔钱，实际工资降低的程度。这笔军事费用有一半以上是以工业定货的方式支出的。由此可见，虽然这还不是全部军事定货，虽然军事工业的产量还没有达到最高点，可是很大一部分的美国工业已经在制造军备了。据《铁器时代》杂志刊载，百分之七十的辗钢都指定供军事定货之用，而这些定货都是与军备计划有关的。
    华盛顿政府为了加速扩充军事工业，把它从纳税的老百姓身上所刮来的这大笔钱献给独占资本家。美政府用纳税优待办法保证投资于军事工业的钱在五年之内，或甚至不到五年，必定还本。凡是用于发展军事工业的私人信用借款，都有政府作保，同时政府本身也借款与资本主义企业。由于这种种措施，一九五一年在工业上的投资的总数将要比去年的水平差不多超过百分之三十。
    华盛顿政府想用这些投资来增加哪些工业的产量呢？列在第一位的就是“运输工具”的生产增加百分之三十八。规定要增加产量的“运输工具”包括飞机、坦克、装甲车、军用所必需的拖拉机和战舰。第二是汽车制造工业增加百分之十七。供应军事工业的需要的电力机器的出产是规定增加百分之十四。化学工业要增加百分之十一；机器制造工业百分之十；钢的出产百分之十。增加“运输工具”的生产所必需的投资，约有百分之五十一是由政府供给的，这一点是值得注意的。
    扩充军事工业的先决条件之一是增加机器的数量。美国各工作母机制造厂承接了这么多定货单，以它们目前生产水平来说，要二十个月才能应付过来。因此各工作母机制造厂在本年第三季所分派到的钢比本年第一季的消耗量增加了百分之四十；铜，百分之三十；铝，百分之二十五。
            二
    美国政府从那里取得资金来用作这个疯狂的军备费用呢？一家大银行“保证信托公司”的五月份公报给了这问题一个答案。这公报结论说：“必然的结果似乎是——缩小个人的消费。”另一家大银行的五月份公报估计，在未来的两年半里，民用消费额将要比一九五○年少。到本年底，民用生产将要比一向所预料的减缩得更多。
    因劳动人民购买力的低落所引起的通货膨胀使得他们的生活水准更加大为降低了。通货不断膨胀的主要原因，是庞大军备费用所造成的预算不平衡。资本家们都从事于大规模的投机。银行的商业信用借款已经增加到既不能和生产相称也不能和现存的准备金相称的程度。而且因为投机盛行的缘故，财政上的周转也大为加快。的确，银行现在正在想法收回一些信用借款，但是，同时预算也入不敷出，至目前为止，估计已经亏空一百六十亿元。在本年未来几个月和明年，入不敷出的情形还要比过去更甚。到那时候，军事生产必定已经增加了，政府订购的军火也必定更大规模地制造出来，国库必须付更多的钱。因此，引向更严重的通货膨胀的道路已经完全筑好了。通货膨胀还有另外一个作用：它使得战争准备更加费钱，在这一点上，战时经济的负责人威尔逊的话是值得注意的。他说国会所拨来用在军备上的钱，每百亿元有二十亿元是因为通货膨胀而损失了。
    就为了这个原因，美国独占资本正在把通货膨胀与物价管制联系起来。物价管制一方面使独占资本更容易增加利润，一方面使劳动人民的生活水准更加减低。这一点从四月底所公布的物价管制条例就可以明显地看出。这些条例适用于许多物品，但是不适用于原料、机器和军事工业必需品。条例的目的很明显——给垄断资本更多牟利的机会。在另一方面，这些条例并不适用于食物和其他主要的消费品。这样做的目的是想利用物价把军事费用的大部分负担转移到劳动人民的肩上去。工资冻结也是达到这目的的一个方法，资本家正在用这个方法来防止工资随着上涨的物价增加。
            三
    垄断资本正在借助军事经济机关来执行它的政策，军事经济机关的首脑们就是大独占资本的主人。下面是几个例子：奇异电力公司的总经理威尔逊就是美国军事生产局局长。难怪这个公司的利润在一九五○年增加到八亿三千四百万元这惊人的巨数。威尔逊的三个主要助理中，一个也代表奇异电力公司，两个代表大采矿公司。所有这几个公司都在摩根银行的势力范围之内。经济稳定局局长蒋士顿是电影业的一个大老板。工资稳定局局长是美国橡皮托辣斯（在杜邦家的势力范围之内）的董事。因为定货和材料的分配都由独占资本来处理，小企业就很难接到定货。他们得不到主要的原料，所以不得不大量地减缩生产或是干脆歇业。相反地，独占资本的利润却飞涨得骇人听闻。例如：制造“运输工具”（就是军备）的企业，比去年增加了百分之九十五的利润。炼油企业的利润上升了百分之五十。采矿公司的利润上升了百分之四十五。
    这种政策一面保证了独占资本获得难以置信的高利，一面大大减低了劳动人民的购买力。为大众消费而出产的物品没有买主。因此，在商店和各种工厂里的滞销的存货愈积愈多。在四月，各种货品的存货超过去年的水平百分之二十。本年初存货继续不断地累积，在三百五十家商店中，所有的传真机和无线电收音机的存货在一年之内增加了两倍。地毡增加了百分之六十，一般主要家庭用具百分之九十一，袜类百分之四十，羊毛毡百分之七十一，玩具百分之七十六，体育用具百分之四十五。同时，零售贸易的卖出额，把涨价计算在内，本年三四月比去年三四月少。本年头四个月，工业的存货增加了百分之十。在四月，工业所承接的定货比三月少百分之十七，虽然军事定货不断在增加。所以，显然地，消费品的需要正在不断降低。许多工业都生产过剩，在纺织业、鞋业、家具业，在制造传真机、无线电收音机、电气冰箱、洗衣机、火炉等各工业部门，情形都是如此。人民的生活水准大为降低，虽然美国现时还没有充分明显地转到战时经济。
    局部的危机所引起的失业，在许多工业中日见增加。工作时间缩短的人数也日见增加。最近福特公司、通用汽车公司和其他汽车公司以及制造大众消费品的企业，把几十万的工人解雇了。有些工厂的工人每周只工作四天。
    消费减少使得存货难以出售，这就造成了这样一个局面：靠大量信用借款来经商的人，现在几乎没有法子还债。结果，工业也受到财政上的困难。这些因素引起了银行存款的大量减少。从四月中旬到五月中旬，纽约和芝加哥两地的银行存款减少了百分之二十四，在别的城市减少了百分之二十。由于不稳定的局面，信用借款很难借到。这是在资本主义国家生产过剩时期所常见的现象。出借的信用借款很少，利息愈来愈高。银行逼着借户归还贷款，清算存款。最近几星期在美国已经观察到这种现象。值得注意的是纽约各大百货公司都宣布许多货品“大减价”，为的是减轻债务，避免破产。这些“大减价”显然暴露了因转变到战时经济所引起的矛盾，和因发展片面的军事的生产及限制平民消费所引起的矛盾。
            四
    在目前，当重工业接有数达几百亿元的大批军事定货和以后更多的定货时，某些工业部门的生产过剩还不至于使美国直接走向生产过剩的总危机。但是，随着军事工业的发展，民用消费物资和生产品的分配愈来愈狭窄了。从本年第三季开始，担任管理军事经济的机关对于制造消费品所使用的钢、铜、铝限制得更严了。在本年第三季，载客汽车的生产将比去年同一季减少百分之三十七，房屋建筑减少百分之四十三。可以断定，为个人消费的生产将继续逐月降低。结果，由此而引起的矛盾将要扩大，必然引向经济危机。美国独占资本想发动一个世界大战以逃避这危机。它现在正忙着准备这战争。
    同时，阶级矛盾也愈来愈尖锐。美国工人阶级在两次世界大战并没有尝到严重的困苦，可是在朝鲜战争爆发以来这一年里，美国劳动人民自己已经看了出来，帝国主义的战争制造者们是牺牲劳动人民的利益而作这血淋淋的冒险行为的。连资产阶级的报纸也不得不承认美国工人阶级反抗的情绪愈来愈高。这在普遍的罢工运动里可以看出。美国独占资本用剥夺自由、用恐怖和法西斯的方法来破坏工人为生活的斗争，都无结果。罢工证明了：巨大的军备费用和在朝鲜的侵略战争所加在美国劳动人民身上的负担，其结果只是引起美国更激烈的阶级斗争。
    所有这些因素都证明美国经济的军事化正引着这国家走向经济危机。而且可以料到这危机一定比美国以往所经验过的还要厉害。帝国主义者们想发动一个新的世界大战来逃避这危机。资本主义的矛盾愈尖锐，帝国主义者的挺而走险的行为也愈频繁。这就使加强人民争取和平的斗争变得更重要了。
