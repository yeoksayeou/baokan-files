Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 30th—General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation, sent a protest letter to Joy, the full text of which is as follows:

To Vice Admiral Joy, Chief Representative of the United Nations Forces Delegation:

At 02:40 on August 29th, one of your military aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone, flying low and circling, and dropped a flare near the conference site. This is another blatant act of illegal provocation by your military aircraft after the bombing of the Kaesong Neutral Zone by your military aircraft on the night of August 22nd. Since the Kaesong negotiations began, your military aircraft have continuously intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone, creating a threatening atmosphere for the conference. After the Kaesong Neutralization Agreement was reached, your aircraft still repeatedly violated the agreement and constantly illegally intruded into the airspace over the Neutral Zone. After our liaison officers brought these violations of the agreement to your attention at the liaison officers' meetings from August 13th to 16th, your liaison officers clearly agreed on the 16th that all armed forces, including the air force, should not intrude into the Neutral Zone. However, although you agreed to the principle of neutralization of the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone, your military aircraft still knowingly violated the law and continuously intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone. Our records of your military aircraft's illegal intrusions into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone from August 17th to August 22nd prove that you have never intended to abide by the agreement you explicitly agreed to. After your military aircraft bombed and strafed our delegation's residence on the night of August 22nd, even though you vehemently denied the major responsibility you bear for this serious incident, you did not feel the need to restrain your military aircraft from intruding into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone. The complete records of your military aircraft constantly intruding into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone day and night from August 23rd to August 28th prove that you truly deserve to be called audacious violators of the agreement. At 02:40 on August 29th, your military aircraft even dropped a flare near the conference site in the airspace over the Neutral Zone. Your unbridled and impenitent provocative actions once again prove that you have not abandoned your conspiracy to continue creating incidents. I lodge a serious protest with you regarding the intrusion of one of your military aircraft into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone and the dropping of a flare at 02:40 on August 29th, as well as your military aircraft's continued provocative actions of intruding into the Kaesong Neutral Zone to date, and demand that you severely punish the culprits and thoroughly guarantee that no more incidents violating the Neutral Zone agreement occur.

　　美机又侵入开城中立区上空投掷照明弹
    南日将军向乔埃提出严重抗议
    要求美方严惩肇事人员，彻底保证不再发生破坏中立区协议的任何事件。
    【新华社开城三十日电】朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军给乔埃的抗议书，全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表乔埃海军中将：
    八月二十九日二时四十分你方军用飞机一架，侵入开城中立区上空低飞盘旋，在会址区附近投掷照明弹一枚，这是你方军用飞机于八月二十二日夜轰炸开城中立区以后，又一显著的非法挑衅行为。自从开城谈判以来，你方军用飞机就不断侵入开城中立区上空，造成对会议的威胁气氛。开城中立化协议达成以后，你方飞机犹仍一再破坏协议，不断非法侵入中立区上空，我方联络官在八月十三日至十六日的联络官会议上，将这种违反协议的事件提请你方注意后，十六日你方联络官明确同意一切武装部队包括空军在内不得侵入中立区。但你方虽然同意了开城中立区上空中立化的原则，你方军用飞机却仍然知法犯法，不断侵入开城中立区上空。从八月十七日至八月二十二日止，我方对于你方军用飞机非法侵入开城中立区上空的记录，证明了你方从来就无意遵守你方所明白同意的协议。八月二十二日夜你方军用飞机轰炸与扫射我方代表团住所以后，尽管你们矢口抵赖你方对于这一严重事件所负的重大责任，但你们并没有觉得有约束你方军用飞机不得侵入开城中立区上空之意。从八月二十三日至八月二十八日你方军用飞机日夜不断侵入开城中立区上空的全部记录，证明你们真不愧是胆大妄为的协议的破坏者。八月二十九日二时四十分你方军用飞机竟在中立区上空会址区附近投掷照明弹，你方这种肆无忌惮不知悔改的挑衅行为，再一次地证明你方并未放弃继续制造事件的阴谋。对于八月二十九日二时四十分，你方军用飞机一架侵入开城中立区上空并投掷照明弹，以及你方军用飞机至今不断侵入开城中立区的挑衅行为，我向你提出严重抗议，并要求你严惩肇事人员，彻底保证你方不再发生破坏中立区协议的任何事件。
      朝鲜人民军  中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军
                一九五一年八月三十日
