To the Editors:

Since the Chinese People's Anti-American, Aid-Korea General Association issued the call on June 1st to promote patriotic pacts, increase production and donations, and give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, it has been enthusiastically responded to by the people of the whole country. However, in Qinglong and Dushan Townships, Shiguan District, Lai'an County, Northern Anhui, these three tasks have not yet been carried out. When I asked Zhang Zhigao, the village head of Qinwang Village in Qinglong Township, about the village's implementation of patriotic pacts, increased production and donations, and preferential treatment work, he said, "The higher authorities have not announced it, and I don't know about these things." I told Qinglong Township cadres Shi Furong, Yu Wenhua, and others about this situation. They were also unaware of the June 1st call of the Chinese People's Anti-American, Aid-Korea General Association.

The reason why the Anti-American, Aid-Korea movement has not been launched in these two townships is that the district and township leaders have not attached importance to the Anti-American, Aid-Korea work; and the higher-level leading organs also lack inspection of their work. I suggest that the leaders of Lai'an County promptly inspect and correct the work of these two townships.

　　皖北来安县青龙、独山两乡抗美援朝运动还没展开
    编辑同志：
    中国人民抗美援朝总会在六月一日发出推行爱国公约、增产捐献和优待烈属军属的号召后，已经得到全国人民的热烈响应。但是皖北来安县施官区青龙、独山两乡到现在为止，还没有进行这三项工作。在我向青龙乡秦王村村长张志高问起该村推行爱国公约、增产捐献和优抚工作的情况时，他说：“上级没有宣布过，我不知道这些事。”我把这个情况告诉青龙乡乡干部史福荣、俞文华等。他们竟也不知道中国人民抗美援朝总会六月一日的号召。
    这两个乡的抗美援朝运动未搞起来的原因，是区、乡领导干部没有重视抗美援朝的工作；而上级领导机关对他们的工作也缺乏检查。我建议来安县领导上迅速对该两乡工作进行检查、纠正。
