Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. To accelerate the assembly of the North Atlantic aggressive military machine, the United States government has recently decided to convene two international conferences to solve the numerous difficulties it has encountered in this issue. The first conference is the US, UK, and France meeting scheduled to be held in Washington. The US government formally proposed the suggestion to the British and French governments in mid-July, and the British government agreed on July 21st. According to Reuters, the meeting will mainly "accelerate the discussion of the issue of West Germany's contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty forces, which has been negotiated for a long time without results." According to United Press, the meeting will also discuss the issue of Greece and Turkey joining the North Atlantic Treaty. The second conference is the North Atlantic Treaty Council meeting (attended by the foreign ministers of twelve countries) scheduled to be held in mid-September, with the main agenda being the same as the three-country meeting.

The reason why the United States wants to hold these two meetings is that since the United States instructed Western countries to unilaterally declare "the end of the war with Germany," the activities it has been urgently engaged in to unify the two West German military building plans of the Petersberg Conference and the Paris European Army Conference have been slow to progress. Therefore, it attempts to further exert pressure on Britain, France, and other Western European vassal states through these two meetings to achieve the goal of rapidly establishing a West German army.

As is well known, for a long time, the United States has been forcing the French government to formally agree to the Petersberg Conference's proposal to establish twelve West German divisions at the European Army Conference after the election. However, because the French reactionaries were defeated in the election, the French government has been afraid to openly agree to the US demands. On July 24th, the European Army Conference submitted the second so-called "interim report." Although the representatives of the French, Italian, Belgian, Luxembourg governments and the West German puppet government participating in the meeting agreed in principle to sign a so-called "European Allied Forces Treaty" with a term of fifty years, so that the West German army could join the North Atlantic aggressor forces as a member of the "European Army," agreement could not be reached on several key issues. Especially on the issue of the size of the units of the West German army participating in the "European Army," although the representative of the West German puppet government, acting as the spokesperson for the United States, insisted at the meeting that the West German army must be formed in divisions of 12,000 men, France still advocated that the units of the West German army could only be combat teams of 6,000 to 8,000 men. Now, the United States is preparing to directly force the French and British governments to accept the US plan at the three-country meeting.

The reason why the United States is so anxious about the issue of arming West Germany reflects the meager progress it has made in building the strength of the entire North Atlantic aggressor group. Since the US warlord Eisenhower established the headquarters of the North Atlantic aggressor forces in Paris in early April this year, he has not achieved much success in his work of recruiting cannon fodder to form the North Atlantic aggressor forces. Former US Secretary of Defense Johnson revealed during his testimony at the US Senate's "investigation" hearing on the "MacArthur Incident" in June that "Eisenhower encountered great difficulties in urging US allies to take action." United Press International, London, July 6, sadly admitted: "Eisenhower hoped to have twenty-five well-equipped divisions by the end of this year, but this hope has quickly disappeared. Eisenhower now has only twelve divisions that he has obtained and can fight if necessary." "It is said that the main reason for the current delay in completing the goal is the lack of agreement among the members of the North Atlantic Alliance on how many troops each country should contribute and the financial burden." In July, nine members of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee also reached the same bleak conclusion after investigating the "military preparedness" of Western European countries. According to Agence France-Presse, Washington, July 23, they believed that "General Eisenhower is still encountering great difficulties in his work." The spokesperson of this investigation team, Smith, publicly rebuked in Paris on July 9 that "several European governments have not made enough sacrifices for the cause of expanding armaments." It is under these circumstances that US imperialism is eager to rebuild the West German army, attempting to use it as the vanguard of aggression.

However, the future of the US plan to arm West Germany, which it is currently so eager to pursue, is still fraught with difficulties. When the United States suggested holding a three-country meeting, threatening to establish a West German army before the "European Army" was established and to directly incorporate it into the North Atlantic Army first, the French reactionaries were extremely panicked, and the French Ambassador to the United States continuously "consulted" with the US State Department. France has not yet responded to the suggestion to hold a three-country meeting. According to Alphand, the French representative to the European Army Conference, the French government can only express its attitude after carefully studying the "interim report" of the European Army Conference. In addition, regarding the US establishment of a "European Army" with West Germany, France, and Italy as the core, and excluding Britain's influence on the European continent, according to Brewster, one of the members of the US Senate nine-member investigation team, Britain "expressed opposition."

### 拼凑北大西洋集团侵略军遭遇严重困难  美建议召开美英法会议加紧武装西德

　　拼凑北大西洋集团侵略军遭遇严重困难
    美建议召开美英法会议加紧武装西德
    【新华社二日讯】为了加紧装配北大西洋侵略军事机器，美国政府最近已决定召开两个国际会议，来解决它在这个问题上所遭到的重重困难，第一个会议是定在华盛顿召开的美、英、法三国会议。美国政府已于七月中旬向英、法两国政府提出正式建议，英国政府并已于七月二十一日表示同意。据路透社称：会议主要将“加速讨论谈判了好久而仍无结果的西德对北大西洋公约军的贡献问题”。另据合众社称：会议也将讨论希腊、土耳其两国加入北大西洋公约的问题。第二个会议是定于九月中举行的北大西洋公约理事会会议（由十二国外长参加），主要议程与三国会议一样。
    美国所以要召开这两个会议，是因为美国在指使西方各国片面宣布“结束对德战争状态”以来，所急切从事的要统一彼得斯堡会议和巴黎欧洲军会议两种西德建军计划的活动，迟迟没有进展。因此，企图通过这两个会议来进一步对英、法及其他西欧附庸国行使压力，以达到迅速建立西德军队的目的。
    如所周知，很久以来，美国就一直逼迫法国政府在大选以后，要在欧洲军会议上正式表示同意彼得斯堡会议关于建立十二个师团西德军队的建议，但是，由于法国反动派在大选中遭到失败，法国政府一直不敢公然答应美国的要求。七月二十四日，欧洲军会议提出了第二次的所谓“临时报告”，参加会议的法国、意大利、比利时、卢森堡四国政府与西德傀儡政府的代表虽然在原则上同意了签订一个为期五十年的所谓“欧洲联军公约”，使西德军队能作为“欧洲军”的成员而加入北大西洋侵略军，但是在若干关键性问题上，仍然不能获得协议。特别是在西德军队参加“欧洲军”的单位大小问题上，虽然作为美国代言人的西德傀儡政府代表在会上坚持西德军队必须以一万二千人的师团为单位编建，而法国却仍然主张西德军队的单位只能是六千人至八千人的战斗队。现在，美国就准备在三国会议上，直接逼迫法、英两国政府接受美国的计划。
    美国在武装西德问题上所以表现如此着急，反映了它在建立整个北大西洋侵略集团力量方面的进展微少。自从美国军阀艾森豪威尔今年四月初在巴黎成立北大西洋侵略军总部以来，他在搜罗炮灰编组北大西洋侵略军的工作上，一直没有什么成就。美国前国防部长詹逊六月间在美国参议院关于“麦克阿瑟事件”的“调查”会上作证时，就曾透露：“艾森豪威尔在促使美国盟国采取行动方面遭遇了极大的困难。”合众社伦敦七月六日电悲哀地供认：“艾森豪威尔希望在今年年底时能有二十五个装备好了的师，现在这种希望已很快地消失了。艾森豪威尔现在所得到的和在必要时可以作战的只有十二个师。”“据说目前迟迟不能完成目标的原因，主要是北大西洋联盟成员国之间对于各国应拿出多少军队及财政方面的负担都缺乏协议。”七月间美国参院外交委员会九个委员到西欧各国调查“军事准备情况”以后，也得出了同样的黯淡结论，据法新社华盛顿七月二十三日电透露，他们认为：“艾森豪威尔将军在他的工作中仍遭遇到很大的困难”。这个调查团的发言人史密斯七月九日曾在巴黎公开斥责“欧洲某几国政府在为扩充军备事业上所作的牺牲不够”。正是在这种情形下，美帝国主义急切地希望重建西德军队，企图以之作为侵略的先锋。
    但是，美国目前如此急切从事的武装西德计划，其前途仍然充满了困难。当美国建议举行三国会议，威胁将在“欧洲军”成立以前即建立西德军队，并将其先行直接编入北大西洋军以后，法国反动派极为惶恐，法国驻美大使不断与美国国务院“会商”。对于召开三国会议的建议，法国到现在还没有答复，据法国出席欧洲军会议的代表阿尔芳说，法国政府只有在详细研究欧洲军会议的“临时报告”后，才能表示态度。另外，对于美国成立以西德、法国、意大利为核心的“欧洲军”，而排斥英国在欧洲大陆上的势力一节，据美国参院九人调查团团员之一布鲁斯特说：英国“表示反对”。
