    "The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" Helped Me Correctly Understand Wu Xun

    To the Editor:

    I have attentively read the "Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" published in the People's Daily three times. This article, like a basin of cool water, has awakened me from my daze, and I truly understand Wu Xun! I realize that Wu Xun was a big rogue, a big usurer, and a big landlord who used the banner of "establishing free schools" to serve the landlord class and the reactionary government. I realize that my past "adoration" and "admiration" for Wu Xun was a manifestation of not standing on the people's side. I completely agree with what "The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun" says: now is the era of the People's Republic of China, and the era of using Wu Xun's corpse to deceive the Chinese people has long passed. Other deceived people should also wake up!

### 《武训历史调查记》使我正确地认识了武训

    《武训历史调查记》使我正确地认识了武训编辑同志：
    人民日报发表的《武训历史调查记》，我已专心地看了三遍。这篇文章像一盆清凉的水一样，使我从昏迷中清醒过来了，我真正的认识了武训！我认识了武训是一个打着“兴义学”的招牌，为地主阶级和反动政府服务的大流氓、大债主和大地主，我认识了我过去对武训的“崇拜”、“钦佩”，是没有站在人民立场上的表现。我完全同意《武训历史调查记》中所说的，现在是中华人民共和国的时代了，用武训这具僵尸欺骗中国人民的时代早已过去了。其他被欺骗的人们也应当清醒了！
