We Visited Glorious Military Families on the Eve of "August 1st"

On the eve of the 24th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, we, representing all employees of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau, visited 64 military families to express our regards. When we met each glorious mother of revolutionary soldiers, they all expressed the sentiment that "the government takes such good care of us," showed us photos of their sons in military uniform sent from the troops, and told us about the letters they received, showing the infinite glory of these mothers.

They are not only glorious mothers who sent their sons to join the army to defend the motherland, but also the backbone in implementing the government's call to action, completing all tasks in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and organizing increased production, achieving great results in the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement. For example, Liu Muwen, mother of Liu Zhonghui who is attending a military cadre school, told us, "It is an honor for my son to join the army. The Eighth District has also elected me as a military family representative and a women's production committee member. I often help military families solve some difficult problems, and the organization of production has been successful. I was even praised in the newspaper." She found the newspaper and showed it to us. Gao Wenyu's sister told us, "Our Seventh District has established a military family production cooperative. Almost all military families have participated in production, solving the problem of livelihood for military families. At the same time, production has increased, which is also a contribution to the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea effort." This is another expression of glory by military families! They are all actively participating in the practical work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea with a high degree of love for the motherland, supporting the front lines with practical actions!

Beijing First District Organizes Visiting Groups to Visit Military Families

Editor Comrade:

The First District of Beijing, in response to the call of the General Association for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea to strengthen preferential treatment work, organized visiting groups to visit military families, which gave great spiritual comfort and encouragement to the military families. More than 80% of the 1,600 military families in the district have normal lives. Only a very small number of those with large families and low incomes cannot make ends meet, and these people have already received government subsidies. After the visits, some military families said happily, "Seeing you is like seeing my own children!" Others said, "I have difficulties, and the country also has difficulties. The government cares about us so much, so even if there are some difficulties, we should try to solve them ourselves." Many military families also stated, "We must earnestly implement the patriotic pact to repay the government's concern." When the visiting group was about to leave, some military families repeatedly urged, "Come often in the future!"

Should Correctly Understand and Seriously Implement the Notice on Abolishing the "No Pregnant Women" Rule

Editor's Note: The "Notice on Abolishing the 'No Pregnant Women' Rule in Recruiting Staff and Students" issued by the Personnel Department of the Central People's Government has been widely supported by the people. However, a few people still have incorrect views on this notice, and some agencies have not seriously implemented it. They mistakenly believe that recruiting pregnant women to work or study is equivalent to recruiting a staff member or student for nothing, which would waste state funds; some even raise the banner of "respecting women" to defend the unreasonable rule of "no pregnant women." In order to further clarify this feudal remnant thought, we now publish a letter from reader Lin Hong, who has different opinions on the Personnel Department's notice, and the reply from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and we hope that readers will express their opinions on this.

Reader Lin Hong's Letter

The Personnel Department of the Central People's Government issued the "Notice on Abolishing the 'No Pregnant Women' Rule in Recruiting Staff and Students," saying that the "No Pregnant Women" rule is contrary to the principle of equality between men and women and "is inconsistent with the spirit of the Common Program"; and requires all agencies to check for the existence of erroneous ideas of discrimination against women. I believe that this notice has a mechanical understanding of the principle of equality between men and women. It does not specifically recognize gender equality from the differences between men and women, and therefore treats the "no pregnant women" rule, which respects and protects women, as discrimination against women. We know that after a woman becomes pregnant, she should not work or study for several months before and after childbirth and needs to rest; otherwise, it will not only affect the woman's health but also the health of the baby. The time between discovering the pregnancy and needing to rest is very short. If an agency or school accepts such a pregnant woman, it will certainly have to let her rest when she needs to rest; then, wouldn't it be equivalent to letting her study for nothing in the school, or recruiting a staff member for nothing during this period in the agency? If a woman who has already joined the workforce or is studying becomes pregnant during work or study, the agency and school should of course be responsible for taking care of her and should not reject her; otherwise, it would be discrimination against women. However, for women who are pregnant and come to apply for work or study, the responsibility of the agency and school should be to advise them to apply again after giving birth. This is not only to respect and protect women, but also for the needs of work and study and the proper expenditure of state funds.

I suggest that the Personnel Department revoke this notice and provide a correct explanation of the "no pregnant women" rule.

Lin Hong

Reply from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

The "Notice on Abolishing the 'No Pregnant Women' Rule in Recruiting Staff and Students" issued by the Personnel Department of the Central People's Government is a correct measure to further clarify the feudal remnant thought of discrimination against women, gradually eliminate the special difficulties left to women by the old society, and specifically realize the provisions of Article 6 of the Common Program. This notice has been widely supported by the masses since its promulgation.

However, some people still have different opinions on this notice. Comrade Lin Hong put forward the opinion that gender equality should be specifically recognized from the differences between men and women, and believes that pregnant women need to rest, so not accepting pregnant women is to respect and protect women. We believe that this is still essentially a product of the feudal remnant thought of discrimination against women.

When some agencies and schools recruit staff or students, the rule of "no pregnant women" is actually not, as Comrade Lin Hong said, for the purpose of "protecting women" or "respecting women," but because they believe that pregnant women giving birth affects work and study and increases their expenses. They do not recognize that women giving birth is a contribution to society, but put the interests of women and children in opposition to the interests of work departments. This is clearly a manifestation of the feudal remnant thought of discrimination against women and children. What Comrade Lin Hong said: if she is allowed to rest, then wouldn't it be equivalent to letting her study for nothing in the school, or recruiting a staff member for nothing during this period in the agency, is also a manifestation of this kind of thought. And his argument is also not in accordance with the facts. Because generally speaking, pregnant women, except for the need to rest for about two months before and after childbirth, can fully work and study during other periods of pregnancy. Moreover, in order to take care of specific situations, the notice of the Personnel Department of the Central People's Government also clearly stipulates: "If it is true that a certain job or study is not suitable for pregnant women to participate in, it must be examined by a hospital or doctor, and only after proving the specific health conditions of the pregnant woman, may pregnant women not be accepted." This is precisely an attitude responsible to the country and the people.

Chinese women have made tremendous contributions in the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, and in the future, they must play their role more effectively in continuing to oppose enemies at home and abroad and in the cause of national construction. Agencies under the leadership of the People's Government will not allow phenomena of discrimination against women or obstruction of women's progress. The Personnel Department's notice suggests that the personnel departments of all agencies deeply study the provisions of Article 6 of the Common Program, check for the existence of erroneous ideas of discrimination against women, "and require that in conjunction with the specific situation of the agency, reform and improve various systems and measures for the education, welfare, and work of women cadres." in order to solve the many specific and special difficulties left to women by the old society, so that women can exert greater strength in their work. This is one of the necessary steps to realize Article 6 of the Common Program and is fully in line with the overall interests of the country and the people. All agencies in various localities should earnestly implement the Personnel Department's notice and recognize the important significance of this notice ideologically.

            我们在“八一”前夕慰问了光荣的军属
    在纪念人民解放军建军节二十四周年前夕，我们代表天津电业局全体职工到六十四户军属家中去慰问。当我们见到每一位光荣的革命军人的母亲时，他们都表示了“政府对我们照顾的太周到了”的心情，把儿子从部队寄来的穿军装的照片给我们看，讲给我们来信的情形，表现出这些母亲们的无限的光荣。
    她们不但是保卫祖国送儿子参军的光荣的母亲，也是执行政府的号召、完成一切抗美援朝工作、组织增加生产的骨干，在抗美援朝运动中有很大的成绩。如参加军事干部学校的刘仲慧的母亲，刘穆文告诉我们说：“儿子参军是光荣的，八区又选我为军属代表、妇女生产委员，我也经常去帮助军属解决些困难问题，组织生产有成绩，还在报纸上受到了表扬。”她把这报纸找出给我们看。高文友的姐姐告诉我们说：“我们七区成立了军属生产合作社，差不多所有的军属都参加了生产，解决了军属的生活困难问题。同时增加了生产，这也是抗美援朝工作。”这是军属表现出又一重的光荣！她们都在以高度的热爱祖国的心情，积极地参加了抗美援朝的实际工作，以实际行动支援前线！

            北京市第一区  组织访问组慰问军属编辑同志：
    北京市第一区，响应抗美援朝总会关于加强优抚工作的号召，组织了访问组，到军属家里进行慰问，这给军属精神上以很大的安慰和鼓舞。全区一千六百多户军属，有百分之八十以上生活是正常的。人口多、收入少，不能维持者是极少数，这些人已享受了政府的补助。经访问后，有的军属高兴地说：“看见你们和看见我自己孩子一样高兴！”也有的说：“我有困难，国家也有困难，政府这样关怀我们，即使有点困难，自己应当想办法解决。”还有许多军属表示：“一定要好好执行爱国公约，回答政府的关怀。”当访问组临走时，有的军属一再叮咛：“你们以后常来呀！”

            应该正确认识并认真执行废除“不收孕妇”规定的通知
    编者按：中央人民政府人事部“关于废除招考工作人员及学员时‘不收孕妇’规定的通知”颁发后，已经得到广大人民的拥护。但是，有少数人对这个通知还有着不正确的看法，有一些机关也没有认真执行这个通知。他们错误地认为，招收孕妇参加工作、学习等于白招收了一个工作人员或学员，会浪费国家的开支；有的甚至打起“尊重妇女”的旗号来为“不收孕妇”这个不合理的规定辩护。为了进一步澄清这种封建残余思想，我们现在把对人事部的通知有不同意见的读者林红来信和中华全国民主妇女联合会的答复发表于后，并且希望读者对此发表意见。
            读者林红的来信
    中央人民政府人事部发布“关于废除招考工作人员及学员时‘不收孕妇’规定的通知”，说“不收孕妇”的规定有背于男女平等的原则，“是和共同纲领的精神不相符合的”；并要求各机关检查是否存在歧视妇女错误思想”。我认为，这一通知对男女平等原则的了解是机械的。它没有从男女的差别上来具体地认识男女平等，因此把尊重妇女、保护妇女的“不收孕妇”的规定，当作是对妇女的歧视。我们知道：妇女怀孕后，在产前产后数月内不宜于工作和学习，而需要静养；否则不但影响妇女的健康，且有碍于婴儿的健康。在发觉怀孕到需要静养这一时间距离是很短的。如果机关、学校收了这样的孕妇，在她需要休息时当然不能不让她休息；那么，在学校中岂不是等于让她白学了一段，在机关中岂不是等于在这一时期内白招收了一个工作人员。如果已经参加工作和学习的妇女在工作和学习期间中怀了孕，机关和学校当然应当负起照料的责任，而不能不要她们；否则就是歧视妇女了。但是，对于怀了孕而来要求工作和要求学习的妇女，机关和学校的责任就应当是劝告她们在分娩以后再来应试。这不但是为了尊重和保护妇女，而且也是为了工作学习的需要和国家经费的正当开支。
    我建议人事部取消这一通知，并对于“不收孕妇”的规定加以正确的解释。
                                                      林红
            中华全国民主妇女联合会的答复
    中央人民政府人事部“关于废除招考工作人员及学员时‘不收孕妇’规定的通知”，是进一步澄清歧视妇女的封建残余思想和逐步解除旧社会遗留给妇女的特殊困难、具体实现共同纲领第六条规定的正确措施。这一通知颁发后，已经得到广大群众的拥护。
    但是，还有一部分人对这个通知有着不同的意见。林红同志提出了应该从男女的差别上来具体地认识男女平等的意见，认为孕妇需要静养，因此不收孕妇才是尊重妇女、保护妇女。我们认为，这在实质上仍是歧视妇女的封建残余思想的产物。
    某些机关、学校招收工作人员或学员时，规定“不收孕妇”，实际上决不是如林红同志所说的是为了“保护妇女”、“尊重妇女”，而是认为孕妇生孩子影响工作、学习，增加了他们的开支。他们不承认妇女生孩子是对社会的贡献，而把妇女儿童的利益和工作部门的利益对立起来。这显然是歧视妇女儿童的封建残余思想的表现。林红同志所说：如果让她休息，那么在学校中等于让她白学了一段，机关中岂不是等于在这一期内白收了一个工作人员。也正是这一种思想的表现。而他的论据，也是不合事实的。因为一般说来，孕妇除产前产后需要休养约两个月外，在怀孕期内其他期间是完全可以工作、学习的。何况中央人民政府人事部的通知，为了照顾具体情况，又明确规定：“如果确有某项工作或学习不适于孕妇参加时，必须经过医院或医生的检查，证明孕妇的健康等具体情况后，始得不收孕妇。”这正是对国家、对人民负责的态度。
    中国妇女在中国人民革命斗争中有着巨大的贡献，今后在继续反对国内外敌人和国家建设事业中还必须更有效地发挥妇女的力量。人民政府领导下的机关，决不容许有歧视妇女、阻碍妇女进步的现象。人事部的通知中建议各机关人事部门深刻学习共同纲领第六条的规定，检查是否存在歧视妇女的错误思想，“并要求结合本机关的具体情况，改革和改进对于妇女干部教育、福利、工作等各项制度和措施。”以解决旧社会留给妇女的许多具体的特殊困难，使妇女在工作中发挥更大的力量。这是实现共同纲领第六条的必要步骤之一，是完全符合于国家人民的全面利益的。各地机关都应该认真执行人事部的通知，并从思想上认识这个通知的重要意义。
