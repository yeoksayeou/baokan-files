　　Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, 12th: The British colonial authorities in Malaya have recently been even more frantic in their unwarranted arrests of Overseas Chinese, and have been forcibly conscripting local and Overseas Chinese youth into military service. The Singapore British "Criminal Investigation Department" launched a large-scale search at dawn on June 25th, searching the Overseas Chinese Aitong School, Kunxing Company, and other shops and residences in the urban and suburban areas, and detaining fifteen people from the Overseas Chinese education and business circles, including Xue Yongshu, Cai Zhenjian, and Ye Fanfeng. On July 15th, British police arrested seventeen Overseas Chinese teachers and students, including thirteen women, during searches in various areas of Penang.

　　At the same time, British imperialism is stepping up its forced conscription of Overseas Chinese youth in Malaya to serve as cannon fodder for imperialist wars of aggression. According to official British figures, as of the end of June, the number of Overseas Chinese conscripted for service had reached 863. On July 4th, the "Far East British Military Headquarters" in Singapore announced a "new plan" to "train local youth to join the British army," which stipulated that "after completing training, they can serve in the army for six years, and after the term expires, their service period can be extended to twenty-two years." This behavior of British imperialism in forcibly conscripting local youth and Overseas Chinese youth has been universally opposed by the people of Malaya and Overseas Chinese.

    疯狂无理拘捕华侨
    【新华社十二日讯】新加坡消息：马来亚英国殖民当局最近更疯狂地无理拘捕华侨，并强征当地及华侨青年服兵役。新加坡英国“罪犯调查部”于六月二十五日黎明发动大规模的搜查，先后在市区和郊外搜查我华侨爱同学校、昆兴公司及其他商店和住宅，拘留华侨教育界及工商界人士薛永黍、蔡贞坚、叶帆风等十五人。七月十五日英警在槟榔屿各地区搜查时，又逮捕华侨教员及学生十七名，其中十三名为女性。
    同时，英帝国主义正在马来亚加紧强征华侨青年充当帝国主义侵略战争的炮灰。据英官方供认，截至六月底，被征召服役的华侨已达八六三名。七月四日，新加坡“远东英军总部”又宣布一个“训练当地青年参加英军”的“新计划”，其中规定“训练完毕，可在陆军中服役六年，满期后，可延长其服役期限至二十二年”。英帝国主义这种强征当地青年及华侨青年的行为，已遭到马来亚人民及华侨的普遍反对。
