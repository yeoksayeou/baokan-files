The Civil Affairs Department of the People's Government of Zhejiang Province issued a circular in July criticizing Dinghai County for not paying attention to the construction of democratic political power and for not convening people's representatives conferences from all walks of life, and ordered it to conduct a self-criticism.

The circular began by stating: "Chairman Mao once instructed us: 'We must conscientiously hold people's representatives conferences from all walks of life that are sufficient to unite people from all walks of life to carry out work together.' Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi also clearly pointed out in his speech at the Third People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in Beijing: 'People's representatives conferences at all levels should be held on schedule regardless of whether there are any matters or not. 'Too much work' should be held even more so, in order to mobilize more people and unite the active elements among the people to do these so-called too much work separately. ... We must make people's representatives conferences at all levels (in the land reform areas, it is the peasant representatives conference) the central link of all work and all activities of people's governments at all levels.'" The Central People's Government and the Provincial People's Government have also repeatedly instructed and urged all cities and counties to convene people's representatives conferences from all walks of life on schedule.

The circular pointed out: Dinghai County has never formally convened people's representatives conferences from all walks of life since liberation; obviously, the above instructions from higher levels have not received sufficient attention. Although the county was liberated relatively late, it has met the basic conditions for convening people's representatives conferences from all walks of life after more than a year of work, but Dinghai County has repeatedly delayed convening people's representatives conferences from all walks of life under the pretext of supporting the front line or being busy with other central tasks. This view of opposing convening people's representatives conferences to other work is inappropriate. In order to correct this ideological deviation in democratic political construction work, the circular required Dinghai County to make a written self-criticism, and required the people's governments of all cities and counties to check their own guiding ideology accordingly, so as to improve the province's democratic political construction work. The Civil Affairs Department of the East China Military and Political Committee believes that the county's neglect of democratic political construction work is worthy of vigilance in all regions, and also copied the circular to the entire East China region for information, requiring all regions to conduct the same inspection and report the inspection situation to the department for review.

　　浙江定海县忽视民主政权工作
    借口工作忙延不召开人民代表会议
    浙江省人民政府民政厅因定海县不重视人民民主政权建设工作，不召开各界人民代表会议，于七月间发布通报予以批评，并饬其进行检讨。
    通报首称：毛主席曾指示我们：“必须认真地开好足以团结各界人民共同进行工作的各界人民代表会议。”刘少奇副主席在北京市第三届各界人民代表会议上的讲话中也曾明确指出：“各级人民代表会议不论有事无事都应按期召开，‘工作太多’更应召开，以便动员更多的人民和团结人民中的积极分子把这些所谓太多的工作分头地去作好。……要使各级人民代表会议（在土地改革的乡区是农民代表会议）成为各级人民政府一切工作和一切活动的中心环节。”中央人民政府和省人民政府也曾一再指示和督促各市、县，要按期召开各界人民代表会议。
    通报指出：定海县自解放以来，一直没有正式召开过各界人民代表会议；显然上级的这些指示没有引起很好重视。该县虽解放较晚，但经过一年多的工作，已具备了召开各界人民代表会议的基本条件，但定海县每以支援前线或其他中心工作繁忙，延不召开各界人民代表会议。这种把召开各界人民代表会议与其他工作对立看待的观点，是不妥当的。为了纠正这种对民主建政工作的思想偏差，通报要求定海县作书面检讨，并要求各市、县人民政府据此检查自己的领导思想，使全省的民主建政工作提高一步。华东军政委员会民政部以该县忽视民主建政工作的现象，很值得各地警惕，亦将是项通报抄知全华东区知照，要求各地作同样的检查，并将检查情形汇报该部审核。（摘自八月十六日浙江日报）
