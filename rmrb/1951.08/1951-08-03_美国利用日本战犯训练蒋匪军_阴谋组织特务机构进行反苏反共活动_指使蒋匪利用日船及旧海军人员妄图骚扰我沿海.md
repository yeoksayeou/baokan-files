Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Tokyo Dispatch: Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, following the instructions of its master, the U.S. Far East Command, established the so-called "Supreme Advisory Committee," completely placing the Chiang bandit army under the training and command of U.S. and Japanese "military advisors," attempting to coordinate this with the conspiratorial activities of the "U.S.-Japan Joint Military Committee," which is being secretly organized, as an attached component of the U.S. military "General Staff."

The members of this committee include: Chase, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group; Martin, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet; Twinner, commander of the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force; Japanese war criminals Hiroshi Nemoto and Naosuke Tomita; and He Yingqin of the Chiang bandit gang. Americans serve as its top leaders. Japanese war criminals are responsible for the training of the Chiang bandit army. Former Japanese fascist military personnel and Shi Rui of the Chiang bandit army are jointly supervising the training of the bandit army in landing operations and planning how to utilize various vessels.

Among the Japanese war criminals participating in this conspiracy, Hiroshi Nemoto possesses special power within the Chiang bandit army. War criminal Hiroshi Nemoto secretly went to Taiwan via smuggling ships in June 1949, which was publicly confirmed by the Special Investigation Bureau of the Japanese reactionary government in a public statement saying: "Former Lieutenant General Hiroshi Nemoto, former Lieutenant Commander Yoshikawa Genzo, and six other former military personnel boarded a ship from the Kyushu coast on June 26, 1949, to go to Taiwan to assist the Kuomintang army in combat." After arriving in Taiwan, Hiroshi Nemoto received preferential treatment from Tang Enbo, and Chiang Kai-shek even regarded him as a "state guest," appointing him as a "senior advisor." He has recruited Japanese soldiers for Chiang Kai-shek several times. He is now also participating in the study of all operational plans of the Chiang Kai-shek command and is guiding various meetings of Chiang Kai-shek military officers in the southern Taiwan military region. The special details attached to the Chiang Kai-shek military training documents bear the signatures of Hiroshi Nemoto and Naosuke Tomita. Tomita, an assistant to Hiroshi Nemoto, once served as the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in South China. In the autumn of 1949, he led eight Japanese aviation officers to Taiwan.

Under the command of Hiroshi Nemoto, a group of Japanese officers who gained combat experience in Korea has recently been transferred to conduct combat training for the Chiang bandit army. Hiroshi Nemoto is also continuing to gather Japanese fascist soldiers in southern Kyushu, preparing to go to Taiwan. The number of former Japanese professional military officers and "military experts" currently utilized by Hiroshi Nemoto has reached 1,500.

Another report: Former Japanese Fleet Commander in China and Governor-General of Taiwan, Admiral Kiyoshi Hasegawa, is also rumored to be going to Taiwan soon to assume the position of "senior advisor" to the Chiang Kai-shek gang.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Tokyo Dispatch: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is colluding with Japanese war criminals and fascist leaders to conspire to organize an "Asia League," preparing to conduct large-scale anti-Soviet and anti-Communist espionage activities under U.S. command. This is one of the results of He Yingqin's activities in Japan.

According to the "Social News," the organ of the Japanese Socialist Party, "a meeting was held at the former site of the Arisugawa Residence in Tokyo (currently used by the Chiang bandit gang's delegation in Japan) to prepare for the establishment of the 'Asia League.'" The participants were all heinous Japanese war criminals, including: Kazushige Ugaki, Neiji Okamura, former Vice Admiral and Chief of the Liaison Department of the "Asia Development Board" in Central China, Shizue Tsuda, veteran spy of aggression against China Junzaburo Yamada, and Zaibatsu Fusanosuke Kuhara, who had close ties with the fascist former military. Kuhara will be nominated as the head of the "League."

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Tokyo Dispatch: U.S. imperialism is directing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to use Japanese ships and former navy personnel in a futile attempt to harass our coastline. According to the Mainichi Shimbun, the Chiang Kai-shek gang recently jointly established the "Japan-China Fisheries Company" with the Japanese Far East Whaling Company and the Nichiro Fishery Company. The specific methods have been negotiated between the Fisheries Agency of the Japanese reactionary government's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the U.S. military headquarters in Japan. The two companies are expected to "provide fishing vessels and technicians," while the Chiang Kai-shek gang will be responsible for the whaling work. The Japanese Far East Whaling Company and the Nichiro Fishery Company are both military-oriented organizations that use fishing to engage in maritime aggression activities. After the war, they received a large number of ships and vessels and related assets from the former navy, disguised as large "fishing boats," while a large number of naval personnel were hidden within them. For example, the Nichiro Fishery Company is a joint venture between Japanese state capital and the Mitsubishi zaibatsu. After the war, it used several 7,000-ton freighters as mother ships, equipped with more than 300 motorized sailing boats to conduct "North Pacific fisheries." This time, under the instructions of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek gang colluded with Japanese war criminals and jointly established the so-called "Japan-China Fisheries Company," the purpose of which is to conspire to use Japanese "ships and technology" to take the opportunity to harass our coastal areas.

　　美国利用日本战犯训练蒋匪军
    阴谋组织特务机构进行反苏反共活动
    指使蒋匪利用日船及旧海军人员妄图骚扰我沿海
    【新华社二日讯】东京消息：最近蒋介石匪帮遵照其主子美国远东统帅部的意旨，成立了所谓“最高咨询委员会”，完全把蒋匪军置于美、日“军事顾问”的训练和指挥之下，妄图以此与正在秘密组织中的“美日联合军事委员会”的阴谋活动互相配合，作为美军“参谋部”的附属组成部分。
    该委员会的组成人员有：美国军事顾问团团长蔡斯、美海军第七舰队司令马丁、美国第十三航空队司令滕纳、日本侵华战犯根本博、富田尚助及何匪应钦等人。由美国人担任其最高领导。关于蒋匪军的训练，则由日本战犯负责。日本法西斯旧军人与蒋匪军的石瑞，正在共同监督匪军登陆作战的训练，以及计划如何利用各种船只等问题。
    参与此一阴谋的日本战犯中，根本博在蒋匪军中拥有特殊权力。战犯根本博于一九四九年六月乘走私船只秘密赴台湾，早经日本反动政府特别审查局在公报中公开证实，该公报称：“前陆军中将根本博，前陆军中佐吉川原三等旧军人六名，于一九四九年六月二十六日，自九州沿岸搭船赴台湾，协助国民党军队作战。”根本博抵台湾后，颇受汤匪恩伯的优遇，蒋匪且视之为“国宾”任为“高级参谋”，曾数次为蒋匪招募日兵。现更加参加研究蒋匪指挥部一切作战计划，并在台湾南部军区指导蒋匪军官的各种会议。蒋匪军事训练文件上所附有的特殊细节，都有根本博及富田尚助的签名。富田为根本博的助手，曾任日寇华南军参谋长，一九四九年秋率领日本航空将校八名赴台。
    在根本博指挥下，最近又调来一批在朝鲜获得战斗经验的日本军官，对蒋匪军实施作战教练。根本博并继续召集日本法西斯军人在九州南部集中，准备赴台湾。现为根本博利用的旧日本职业军官及“军事专家”已达一千五百人。
    另讯：曾任日本驻华舰队司令、台湾总督的战犯长谷川清前海军大将，亦有将于最近赴台湾，就任蒋匪帮“高级顾问”的消息。
    【新华社二日讯】东京消息：蒋介石匪帮勾结日本战犯、法西斯头子，阴谋组织“亚细亚联盟”，准备在美国指挥下，大规模地进行反苏、反共的特务活动。这是何匪应钦到日本活动的结果之一。
    据日本社会党机关报《社会新闻》消息，“在东京有栖川公馆旧址（现为蒋匪帮驻日代表团所用）曾举行会议，筹备成立‘亚细亚联盟’”。与会者都是日本罪大恶极的战犯，计有：宇垣一成，冈村宁次，前海军中将、“兴亚院”华中联络部长官津田静枝，侵华老特务山田纯三郎，以及与法西斯旧军人有密切勾结的财阀久原房之助等。久原且将被推为该“联盟”的负责人。
    【新华社二日讯】东京消息：美帝国主义正指使蒋介石匪帮利用日本船只及旧海军人员，妄图对我沿海进行骚扰。据每日新闻载称：最近蒋匪帮与日本远东海洋捕鲸公司及日鲁渔业公司合办“日华水产公司”，其具体办法已经日本反动政府农林省水产厅与驻日美军总部交涉，预定由该两公司“提供渔船及技术员”，捕鲸工作则由蒋匪帮担任。日本远东海洋捕鲸公司及日鲁渔业公司，都是日本利用渔业从事海上侵略活动的带军事性的机构，战后曾接收旧海军的大量舰艇与船舶及附属资财，伪装作大型“渔船”，而大量的海军人员即隐藏在其中活动。如日鲁渔业公司为日本国家资本与三菱财阀合资经营，战后以七千吨级的货船数只为母船，配以三百只以上的机帆船进行“北洋渔业”。此次蒋匪帮在美国授意之下，勾结日本战犯，与该两公司合办所谓“日华水产公司”，其目的即在阴谋利用日本的“船只和技术”在我沿海一带趁机骚扰。
