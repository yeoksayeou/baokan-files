　　"Legion of Mary" - Enemy of the People
　　Lǐ Xuéwēn
　　When Tianjin was liberated, I was working as a clerk at the Sacred Heart Girls' High School. At that time, Zheng Huamin, a Dutch priest and one of the organizers of the "Legion of Mary," forbade me to read newspapers and progressive books, saying that reading them would easily betray "the faith." Later, a Mr. Du often talked about the Communist Youth League. I was very envious of this progressive youth organization, but Zheng said to me again: joining the Youth League is apostasy. When I wrote a summary of my thoughts at school, he wouldn't allow me to write about the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, saying "the Communist Party is the devil." After I joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Zheng threatened me again, saying: "You are a believer, how can you cooperate with the devil? What will happen when America returns! Holland and America are the most democratic countries."
　　In August 1950, I was working in the Xiaobailou Church. They had a branch of the Legion of Mary called "Our Lady of Charity," and I blindly joined it. Now, looking back, the actions of the "Legion of Mary" were completely reactionary. They often spread reactionary ideas, saying things like "this year is the end of the world," "you can't cooperate with the Communist Party," and so on. In the branch I joined, a Mrs. Wang once reported to the meeting that a believing child had joined the Young Pioneers. When the priest in the meeting heard about it, he quickly said: "His soul is in great danger, the Communist Party wants everyone to join organizations, slowly apostatizing." And he told Mrs. Wang to quickly find a way to persuade the child to withdraw. Last year, a worker at Sacred Heart Girls' High School, Liu Honglin, wanted to join a military cadre school, and the head of the "Legion of Mary" branch asked me to persuade him not to join. Other "Legion of Mary" members also went to persuade him, and as a result, he did not participate. The "Legion of Mary" meetings must be kept secret, it is hostile to the Youth League members, and always tries to persuade the Youth League members of various schools to withdraw from the organization.
　　Not long ago, the Dutch priest Man Jishi also used the "Legion of Mary" to sabotage the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, engage in assassination organizations, form blood alliances, distribute reactionary pamphlets, and send threatening letters. These iron facts all illustrate the heinous crimes of the "Legion of Mary" and Man Jishi. Today, I accuse them with utmost indignation! And I hope that all deceived believers will quickly break away from this secret reactionary organization and stand up to expose them!

　　“圣母军”——人民的死敌
    李学温
    当天津解放时，我在圣功女中做事务员，当时“圣母军”的组织者之一、荷籍神甫郑化民禁止我看报纸和进步书籍，他说看了容易背“信德”。后来有位杜先生时常谈起青年团，我很羡慕这个进步青年的组织，郑又对我说：入青年团就是背教。我在学校写思想总结时，他又不许我写共产党和毛主席，说“共产党是魔鬼”。我参加中苏友好协会以后，郑又威胁我说：“你是奉教的，怎么同魔鬼合作？美国回来怎么办！荷兰、美国才是最民主的国家。”
    一九五○年八月，我在小白楼教堂里做事，他们那儿有一个名叫“仁爱圣母”的圣母军支会，我就盲目参加了。现在回想起来，“圣母军”的所作所为完全是反动的。他们经常散布反动思想，说什么“这个年头是世界的末日”，“不能和共产党合作”等等。在我参加的那个支会，有一次一位王太太向会里报告有一个奉教的小孩参加了少年儿童队。会里神甫听说了赶紧就说：“他的灵魂很危险了，共产党让每一个人都要参加组织，慢慢地背教。”他并且叫王太太赶快设法劝那个小孩退出。去年有一位圣功女中工友刘鸿林想参加军干校，“圣母军”支会的负责人叫我去劝他不要参加。别的“圣母军”会员也去劝他，结果他就没有参加。“圣母军”开会时得保守秘密，它仇视青年团员，总要想法子劝各校青年团员退出组织。
    不久以前，荷籍神甫满济世还利用“圣母军”破坏三自运动，搞暗杀组织，饮血结盟，散发反动小册子，发恫吓信，这些铁的事实，都说明了“圣母军”和满济世的滔天罪恶，我今天以万分激愤的心情控诉他们！并希望一切被骗参加的教徒赶快脱离这个秘密反动组织，并起来检举他们！
