Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: To transform Japan into its own colony and a major base for aggression in the Far East, American imperialism is seizing control of Japan's economy. With the outbreak of the Korean War and the formulation of the so-called US-Japan economic "cooperation" plan, this situation has intensified. Reports in Japanese bourgeois newspapers prove that foreign capital has widely infiltrated Japanese industry. According to materials from the Japanese Foreign Investment Committee recently published in the Yomiuri Shimbun, in the ten months from June 1950 to May 1951 alone, foreigners acquired stocks worth 1,691,632,000 Japanese yen and invested 500,213,500 Japanese yen in real estate. The newspaper also cited examples of contracts concluded with American companies. For example, in heavy industry, the largest Japanese metallurgical company, Yawata Iron & Steel Works, and Fuji Manufacturing Co., Ltd., signed contracts with the American Ammco International Corporation. Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corporation signed a contract with the American Westinghouse Electric Corporation. This contract stipulates that Mitsubishi Electric Corporation can use American patents to produce electrical appliances, telephones, and telegraph equipment. According to this contract, the American company obtained 50 million Japanese yen worth of shares in Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. In the chemical industry, Japan Celluloid Co., Ltd. and the Japanese rayon company Teikoku Rayon Co., Ltd. signed a contract with the American Rayon Company to establish a joint venture, which is effectively equivalent to the American company annexing these two Japanese companies.

Also actively participating in the scheme to enslave Japan's economy are some of the largest American banks that provide loans to Japanese companies. In many cases, these loans are given to Japanese companies to pay for so-called "special" orders, i.e., military orders. For example, Mitsubishi Electric received a loan of $300,000 from Citibank. However, Mitsubishi paid this money to Westinghouse Electric for "technical assistance." Toyota Motor Co., Ltd., a Japanese automobile company that manufactures armored vehicles and military vehicles, received a loan of $3 million from Citibank, which will be used to pay for "special" orders. Kyodo News recently reported that Citibank and Bank of America, two American banks, are particularly active in financially "assisting" Japanese companies, and their total loans to Japanese companies have exceeded $12 million. In addition, Citibank has lent $3 million to fourteen Japanese textile companies, which will be used to manufacture military uniforms and other items. The United States has also invested large amounts of capital in Japan's power industry, and at the same time, the United States is demanding an increase in electricity prices. Some electric companies have already decided to increase electricity prices by 24 to 30 percent respectively.

The situation of foreign capital plundering Japan is particularly evident in foreign trade. When American merchants sell goods to Japan, the prices are based on American market prices plus a "commission" of 30 to 50 percent. Moreover, Japan has to pay particularly high freight charges. However, the goods Japan ships to the United States are sold at American market prices minus "commissions" and freight charges.

The US-Japan "cooperation" plan will create even more favorable conditions for American capital to infiltrate Japan's economy. Naturally, this "cooperation" is not a matter of individual foreign companies colluding with one or another Japanese company, but rather a coordinated plan for American capital to enslave Japan's major industries.

　　美国霸占日本经济
    美国资本广泛渗入日本工业  在对外贸易上残酷掠夺日本
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社东京讯：为了把日本变为美国自己的殖民地和侵略远东的主要基地，美帝国主义者正在霸占日本的经济。随着朝鲜战争的爆发与所谓美日经济“合作”计划的制订，这种情形已经变本加厉。日本资产阶级报纸的报道证明外国资本已广泛地渗入日本工业。根据《读卖新闻》最近刊载的日本外资委员会的材料，仅在一九五○年六月至一九五一年五月这十一个月期间，外国人就获得了为数十六亿九千一百六十三万二千日元的股票，在不动产方面投资达五亿零二百十三万五千日元。该报并引述一些与美国公司缔结合同的例子。例如，在重工业方面，最大的日本冶金公司“八幡制铁所”与“富士制作所”和美国“阿姆柯国际公司”缔结了合同。日本“三菱电气”公司与美国“威斯汀豪斯电气公司”缔结了合同。这个合同规定，“三菱电气”公司可以使用美国的专利权，生产电器与电话以及电报器械。根据这个合同，美国公司获得“三菱电气”公司的五千万日元的股票。在化学工业方面，“日本赛璐珞”公司与日本人造丝公司“帝国人造绢丝”跟“美国人造丝公司”缔结合同，决定建立一个“美国公司与帝国人造绢丝”联合公司，这实际上等于美国公司吞并了这两个日本公司。
    积极参加奴役日本经济的勾当的，还有些给日本公司以贷款的美国最大的银行。在许多情况下，这些贷款都是贷给日本公司用以支付所谓“特别”订货，即军事订货的。例如，“三菱电气”从“花旗银行”获得三十万美元的贷款。可是，“三菱”公司把这笔钱支付给“威斯汀豪斯电气公司”的“技术援助”。制造装甲车与军用汽车的日本汽车公司“丰田自动车”，从“花旗银行”得到三百万美元的贷款，而这笔钱则将用以支付“特别”订货。共同社最近报道，“花旗银行”与“美国银行”这两家美国银行在财政上“援助”日本公司特别积极，它们对日本公司的贷款总量已超过一千二百万美元。除此以外，“花旗银行”给十四家日本纺织公司贷款三百万美元，这笔钱将用于制造军用被服等。美国对日本的动力工业也投了大宗资本，同时，美国要求提高电费。一些电气公司已经决定把电费分别增加百分之二十四至百分之三十。
    外国资本掠夺日本的情形特别显著地表现在对外贸易方面。美国商人卖给日本货物时，价格按美国行情并另加百分之三十到百分之五十的“佣金”。而且，日本还得付出特别高的运费。可是日本运到美国的货物，售价却反而要按照美国行情并扣除“佣金”与运费。
    美日“合作”计划将给美国资本渗入日本经济造成更加有利的条件。自然，这种“合作”不在于个别外国公司同这一个或那一个日本公司勾结，而在于美国资本奴役日本主要工业的配合计划。
