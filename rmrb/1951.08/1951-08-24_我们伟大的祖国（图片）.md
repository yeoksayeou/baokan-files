    Our Great Motherland
    This is Hao Jianxiu, a seventeen-year-old fine yarn worker and outstanding member of the Youth League at the state-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory. Under the education of the Communist Party and the Youth League, she has raised her class consciousness and production enthusiasm. She learns modestly and has created a rational working method, creating a new record for fewer roller flowers. If all fine yarn workers across the country could do as she does, they could produce more than 44,400 more pieces of yarn per year. The National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China is promoting her working method nationwide.

    我们伟大的祖国
    这是国营青岛第六棉纺织厂十七岁的细纱女工，优秀的青年团员郝建秀。她在共产党和青年团的教育下，提高了阶级觉悟和生产积极性，虚心学习，创造了合理的工作方法，创造了少出皮辊花的新纪录。如果全国细纱工都能照她这样做，一年可以多生产四万四千四百多件纱。中国纺织工会全国委员会正把她的工作方法向全国推广。
