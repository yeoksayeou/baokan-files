Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: Ridgway today replied to General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, answering their serious protest of August 23rd regarding the U.S. side's bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone. In this reply, Ridgway demonstrated an utterly arrogant and rogue attitude. Ridgway flatly denied the incident, but because he could not find any reason, he had to insist that this incident was "so utterly false, so preposterously absurd" that "it does not even merit a reply." "Your other instances of UN forces deliberately violating the Kaesong neutral zone do not merit a reply either." Ridgway completely dared not mention the conclusive evidence of the crime of American aircraft bombing the Kaesong neutral zone, but only lied, saying: "My senior commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force have each submitted written reports to me stating that in this...alleged incident of violating the Kaesong neutral zone, his troops did not, and could not have, violated the Kaesong neutral zone." Anyone can see that this is the most clumsy sophistry. Ridgway shamelessly said that he conducted a "full investigation," but in fact, the U.S. liaison officer was initially unwilling to come during this investigation. When he reluctantly came, he denied all the evidence and left in a hurry. From the morning of August 23rd until now, the U.S. side has not sent anyone to conduct any investigation. In his extremely arrogant and shameless reply, Ridgway even completely avoided mentioning the facts that had already been admitted in the public statement of his headquarters. In a public statement issued by Ridgway's headquarters on August 23rd, it was admitted that on August 22nd, "at 21:30, an aircraft of unidentified nationality was detected by radar west of Kaesong." Why is Ridgway unwilling to mention this matter again? Obviously, although this matter was used to retaliate against the Chinese and Korean people, it ultimately carries the risk of exposing the U.S. side's crimes. The U.S. side's vicious conspiracy to create this provocative incident to sabotage the negotiations is now clear.

　　对美机轰炸开城中立区的严重暴行
    李奇微竟矢口抵赖蛮横透顶
    美方破坏谈判的恶毒阴谋已昭然若揭
    【新华社二十五日讯】李奇微于本日复电朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，答复他们于二十三日向李奇微提出的关于美方轰炸开城中立区的严重抗议。李奇微在这个复电中，表现了蛮横透顶的流氓态度。李奇微对此次事件，矢口抵赖，但因为找不出理由，只好硬说这次事件“如此虚假透顶，如此荒谬绝伦”，“其本身就不值一复”。“你方所举的联合国军蓄意破坏开城中立区的其他事件也不值一复”。李奇微完全不敢提及美国飞机轰炸开城中立区罪行的确凿证据，只是撒谎说：“我的陆海空军高级指挥官已分别向我作书面报告说，在这一次……所谓破坏开城中立地区的事件中，他的部队没有、而且也不可能破坏开城中立地区。”任何人都可以看出：这是最拙劣的诡辩。李奇微厚着脸皮说他进行了“充分调查”，而事实上美方联络官在这次调查中，最初是不肯来，勉强来了，对一切罪证都一赖了之，匆匆离去。从二十三日晨，直到现在，美方就再没有派任何人来作过任何的调查。李奇微在他极端蛮横无耻的答复中，甚至对于已经在他总部的公报中所承认下来的事实也都完全避开不谈。李奇微总部在二十三日发表的公报中承认：在二十二日“二十一时三十分在开城以西用雷达侦察出一架国籍不明的飞机”为什么李奇微不愿再提起这件事呢？显然因为这件事虽然被用来反噬中朝人民，但它终究有暴露美方罪迹的危险。美方制造这次挑衅事件以破坏谈判的恶毒阴谋，由此已昭然若揭。
