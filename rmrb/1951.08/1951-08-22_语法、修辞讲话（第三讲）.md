Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 3)
      Lü Shuxiang Zhu Dexi
    Eighth Paragraph: Because, In order to, Due to, As a result, Make/Cause
    "Because" and "In order to". "Because" indicates the reason, "in order to" indicates the purpose. For example:
    (1) A bourgeois republic, other countries may have had it, but China cannot have it, because China is a country oppressed by imperialism. (Mao)
    (2) Advanced people, in order to make the country revive, do not hesitate to struggle hard and seek revolutionary truth. (Mao)
Generally speaking, these two words are easy to distinguish, but they are used incorrectly in the following two sentences:
    (3) When we first came to this village, because it was easier to understand the situation, we decided to take turns eating at each household. (Written work)
    (4) In order to have economic difficulties, I cannot go home this winter vacation. (Written work)
"Because" in (3) should be changed to "in order to". "In order to" in (4) should be changed to "because". Sometimes a sentence can use "because" or "in order to", but the wording is different.
    (5) In order to have no food to eat, he went to a farmer's house to do chores, and then he met the farmers. (Book)
"In order to" here is used incorrectly and should be "because". If "in order to" is used, it should be said "in order to find food to eat".
    "In order to" and "because" also have a difference: "because" can be followed by a sentence form, while "in order to" can only be followed by a phrase, and it must belong to the same subject as the main verb, indicating the purpose of the active agent. For example:
    (6) Some people also thought of going on stage to speak, but in order to continue the performance of the entertainment program, they were temporarily suppressed by the chairman. (Newspaper)
"By the chairman" should be changed to "the chairman suppressed him", otherwise "in order to" would seem to indicate the purpose of the person being suppressed.
    Due to. "Due to" has the same meaning as "because", but now everyone especially likes to use "due to", so its usage also deserves our special attention. The usage of "due to" can be observed in the following sentences:
    (7) Because people's class status is different, people's social essence is also different. (Liu Shaoqi)
    (8) Due to the position of the leaders of the regime, the improvement of the prestige of the leaders easily leads to arrogance, and they refuse criticism and suppress criticism inside and outside the party. (Newspaper)
    (9) Beijing's family handicraft knitting industry, due to weak financial resources, cannot store raw materials or products, and mostly sells on the spot. (Newspaper)
    (10) When American ships loaded with ammunition arrived in Antwerp, Belgium, due to the protests of the dockworkers, they could not unload and had to be transported elsewhere. (Newspaper)
First, "due to" can be followed by a noun, as in (8), or a sentence form, as in (7) and (9), or a subject-predicate phrase between the two, as in (10). Secondly, the phrase or clause headed by "due to" can be placed at the beginning of the sentence, as in (7) and (8), or inserted in the middle, as in (9) and (10). These are all sentences that use "due to" alone. Sentences with other function words used in conjunction with it will be discussed separately below.
    "Due to" indicates the reason. The most common problem with using "due to" is "cause without effect", that is, "due to" becomes unsettled. For example:
    (11) After arriving in Beijing, on the one hand, due to the fact that all revolutionary schools had already started, there was no way to enter; on the other hand, also due to my insufficient understanding of the revolution, there was still a concept of despising short-term schools and fearing transformation in my mind. Under this circumstance, I transferred to Beijing Normal University.
    (12) Due to the complexity of work in Shanghai, the scope of work is very wide, and due to the lack of experience in working in big cities, many problems are due to the establishment of many systems, the lack of thorough consideration, and acting hastily, resulting in the lower levels carrying it out rigidly. (Newspaper)
The error in (11) is obvious. Just combine the two sentences into one, remove "under this circumstance", and add "then" above "transferred" to make it correct. (A better way to change it is to remove "due to" and "also due to", and the two sentences are still separated.) The first two "due to"s in (12) are unsettled. The way to change it is to move "many problems" below "resulting in". But I don't know if this is the author's original meaning. If the author only regards "the establishment of many systems" and "the lower levels carrying it out rigidly" as one cause and one effect, then the first two "due to"s must be settled.
    Secondly, the position of "due to" is sometimes also related. Like this sentence:
    (13) Due to her parents' old-fashioned thinking, they actually strictly controlled their daughter and did not allow her to go out casually. (Letter)
It is very likely to make people misunderstand that "due to" has been controlling "going out", which becomes a cause without an effect. Even if the reader knows that "due to" only controls "old-fashioned", "strictly controlling their daughter" still lacks a subject. Moving "due to" to the position of the word "的" solves the problem. However, strictly speaking, this sentence does not contain a causal relationship. Strictly controlling the daughter is only a manifestation of old-fashioned thinking. "Due to" is not necessary at all (the word "的" is of course cancelled).
    There is also a problem of using "due to" as "by". We say "decided by you" "controlled by him", not "decided due to you" "controlled due to him". This "by" means "let" or "be", and cannot be confused with "due to" (it is not the same as "对" equals "对于"). The "due to" in the following three sentences should be "by":
    (14) Due to admiring the US, and further admiring Japan. (Periodical)
    (15) When the US imperialism directly carries out its aggressive actions, it first selected Korea, which was determined precisely due to Korea's strategic position. (Periodical)
    (16) The movie "Red Flag Song" determined such a theme, that is: due to the ideological transformation of a female worker before and after liberation, it illustrates the difference between today's democratic management of factories and the old bureaucratic management methods. (Periodical)
The comma in (14) should also be removed. The word "所" in (15) should not have been there in the first place. The "determined" in (16) is also inappropriate. Perhaps the author's intention is "adopt" or "choose".
    As a result. The correct usage of "as a result" can be represented by the following two examples:
    (17) I had to go to Pingwang to be a wet nurse three days after giving birth. As a result, my own child starved to death. (Periodical)
    (18) As a result of the editorial department's review every issue, there are slight improvements every issue. (Periodical)
"As a result" in (17) is equivalent to saying "the result of this matter is". (18) can also use the word "is" to replace that comma. Any sentence that cannot be explained in this way has a problem with the "as a result" in it. For example:
    (19) As a result of his investigation and research in all aspects, he discovered that the main root cause was originally here. (Letter)
    (20) As a result of our careful analysis, we believe that there are the following main root causes. (Periodical)
    (21) As a result of the Chinese people's efforts for a happy life in the past year, there have been great achievements. (Periodical)
"As a result of" in (19) can be removed. (20) Change to "After careful analysis, we believe". "As a result of" in (22) is even more redundant.
    "Make/Cause". First of all, we must remember that the word "使" (make/cause) is a verb, and it needs to have a subject, whether it is a word, a phrase, or just the sentence directly in front of it. Nowadays, people especially like to use the word "使". Sometimes they cannot find its subject, sometimes they find it, but the meaning does not make sense, and sometimes it makes sense, but the word "使" is not necessary. Now let's give examples in several situations. The first category:
    (22) After this lesson, it made me more rigorous in my attitude towards reporting news in the future. (Manuscript)
    (23) Through the participation in cadre movement, it also made me truly experience what true equality between men and women is. (Periodical)
    (24) Being able to see this right path and embark on it today makes me feel unspeakable excitement. (Newspaper)
    (25) Secondly, after studying the works of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, it made him slowly learn the correct position and method. (Periodical)
It seems that the "使" (make/cause) in these sentences can be said to take the preceding phrase as its subject. But looking again, the preceding verbs "經過" (after), "通過" (through), "看見" (see), "學習" (study), etc., are also the actions of the following three "I"s and one "he". Then, wouldn't it be more straightforward and coherent to remove the word "使" (make/cause)? (Move "又" (also) in example 23 after "I", and move "才" (only then) in example 25 after "he").
    Second category of examples:
    (26) Under constant ideological education, it made some students change their minds. (Written work)
    (27) In this land reform in southern Jiangsu, it made us deeply realize.... (Periodical)
    (28) From the above, it makes us see that the ways in which landlords destroy land reform are diverse. (Periodical)
    (29) From the enthusiastic reception of comrades and the care of superiors, it made us feel like we were at home, without the slightest bit of unfamiliarity. (Newspaper)
Here, "在……下" (under...) "在……中" (in...) etc. are obviously not suitable as the subject of "使" (make/cause), so the word "使" (make/cause) has no subject. What about removing it? Very good, much better than the original—except for (29). This sentence may need to keep the word "使" (make/cause) and remove "从" (from) and "中" (in).
    There is another type of sentence in which the word "使" (make/cause) is also used improperly or not very well.
    (30) It made more than 6,500 mu of farmland and a large number of houses and farm implements distributed to poor and hired peasants. (Periodical)
    (31) The new society will give women, especially mothers, all kinds of help, making it possible to eliminate all factors that hinder their progress. (Periodical)
    (32) Standing on the people's position, if we discover the mistakes of government workers, we must try to make them correct them. (Letter)
    (33) Political Commissar Ding's attitude toward learning has had a great impact on all comrades in the school. (Newspaper)
"使" (make/cause) and "使得" (making it possible) in the first two sentences should be changed to "把" (ba, indicating disposal). (32) should say "try to correct them". The original sentence of (33) cannot be considered wrong, but it is better to say "gave a great impact to all comrades in the school".
    Redundant expression of cause, effect, and purpose. There are appropriate words to express cause, effect, and purpose. The above sections have been discussed separately. In practice, we often see sentences that use different words in combination. If used well, these relationships can be explained more clearly. If used poorly, it is inevitable to be redundant and cumbersome. Below are examples classified into categories. The first category is the "cause is because" type. For example:
    (34) The reason why the production achievements of the cement factory can advance by leaps and bounds is because the propaganda and mobilization work is done well. (Manuscript)
    (35) The person in charge of the company once said: The reason for the increase in business is mainly due to the company's sufficient funds after the investment. (Newspaper)
    (36) Educate the members and students to clearly recognize that the purpose of learning is to learn various national defense, economic, and cultural construction knowledge in order to serve the motherland and serve the people. (Periodical)
Here, each sentence uses a content word and a function word to express the same meaning, which is not only repetitive, but also incomprehensible: it is understandable that something is because of something or for something; "reason" because, "purpose" in order to, is incomprehensible. (34) should be changed to "One of the reasons is". (35) should be changed to "The main reason is", or "Business has increased, mainly due to". (36) should be changed to "The purpose is".
    The second category is "because...the reason" and "due to...the result". For example:
    (37) The reason why the masses support this system is because this system pays appropriate remuneration according to the quality and quantity of labor paid by the masses. (Manuscript)
    (38) As a result of the large-scale military mobilization of American imperialism, according to the budget message submitted by Truman to Congress on January 16, the US fiscal budget for the 1952 fiscal year reached 71.59 billion US dollars. (Periodical)
"Because... the reason" is equivalent to "because... this reason" is understandable. "Due to... the result" is incomprehensible. The huge US budget is due to large-scale military mobilization, not due to the "result" of large-scale military mobilization. This "result" is the fact that the "budget is huge". Although there is such a difference between these two statements, the repetition and cumbersomeness are the same, and it is best not to use them if you can.
    The third category is the "because... therefore" type. "Because" only matches with "therefore". "Due to" is also followed by "therefore", but the most common are "therefore" and "thus". For example:
    (39) Because the time limit is short, the quality of the project is very poor. (Newspaper)
    (40) Because Master Lu, who led her group, had no confidence in women learning to drive trains and was unwilling to help patiently, the progress of Sun Guilan, Song Guixiang, and Wang Lanying was very slow. (Newspaper)
    (41) Due to the insufficient production of China's mechanized industry, it still cannot meet the needs of the vast rural areas for daily necessities. Therefore, a large part of it still relies on handicrafts to supply. (Newspaper)
According to the principle of linguistic economy, with "because" there is no need for "therefore", and with "therefore" there is no need for "because". But sometimes, in order to clearly divide the boundaries between the cause and effect parts and avoid misunderstanding, it is necessary to use "because" and then "therefore". As in (41), if "therefore" is not used, "due to" can continue to the end, followed by "Therefore, we must organize handicrafts and improve their efficiency." However, if "because... therefore" and "due to... therefore" become clichés, and they are paired everywhere, they are bound to be overused. The "therefore" in (39) can be removed, and (40) may also omit one of "due to" and "therefore" (depending on which clause you focus on).
    The fourth category is the "because... make/cause" type. For example:
    (42) Due to this wrong view, it made me go the wrong way. (Written work)
    (43) In the past thousands of years, because of the domineering rule of the "Great Han Chauvinism" by the rulers of the past, it made the Tibetan people live in the abyss of suffering. (Periodical)
We said above that the word "使" (make/cause) is a verb. But sometimes the subject of "使" (make/cause) is the preceding sentence form, for example, "The weather changes too quickly, and there are four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter in one day, making it difficult for people from outside to adapt." This "使" (make/cause) has a function word nature to some extent. Therefore, it is often used in conjunction with "because" or "due to". But thinking about it carefully, this is not very good. If "because" or "due to" need to have words below it to echo it, it is best to use function words, not content words. Obviously there are "therefore" and "thus", there is no need to pull "使" (make/cause) to answer the difference. With the word "使" (make/cause), we will find a subject for it. Like (42), "wrong view" can be used as the subject of "使" (make/cause), then there is no need to use "due to"; with "due to" there is no need to use "使" (make/cause) ("便" (then) is changed to "就" (then), moved after the word "我" (I)). Like (43), a verb which precedes the word "使" is 受 (suffer), the subject of suffer (omitted) is "Tibetan people", going along with this would also become the subject of "使 (make/cause), How can "Tibetan people make Tibetan people" make sense? Removing the word "使" (make/cause) is very good.
    The fifth category is a variation of the previous category, using "造成" (cause) or "引起" (arouse) instead of "使" (make/cause). For example:
    (44) Due to the above situation, it caused the opposition between urban and rural areas, and the city exploited the countryside. (Written work)
    (45) Due to the reactionary faction's bloody massacre of workers, it aroused the universal anger of the people of Shanghai. (Newspaper)
In both sentences, "due to" should be removed. This format changes again to become like this:
    (46) The occurrence of the accident was due to the fact that management personnel and workers frequently violated safety regulations, production discipline was lax, and there was disunity among cadres. (Book)
Here, it seems that "due to" and "by" are confused (compared to example 15), but if "due to" is changed to "by", it is still not very good. It is better to keep "due to" and remove "是" (is) and "造成的" (caused).
    The following are examples of using three words of this category in a row:
    (47) Major cotton-producing areas such as southern Hebei, central Hebei, Henan, and Shaanxi all greatly reduced cotton fields because of the particularly difficult foreign transportation during the war period. (Periodical)
    (48) Using historical facts to prove that due to the result of the development of natural science itself, it made the metaphysical worldview a "thing that must be discarded". (Newspaper)
    (49) Due to the result of the ideological education of church schools, the pro-American thinking of young students was cultivated. (Newspaper)
    (47) Remove "的原故" (the reason) and "使" (make/cause). (48) Change to "Due to the development of natural science, metaphysics..." or "The development of natural science itself makes metaphysics...". (49) Remove "due to" and "the result".

　　语法、修辞讲话（第三讲）
      吕叔湘　朱德熙
    第八段  因为、为了、由于、结果、使
    “因为”和“为了”。  “因为”是表示原因的，“为了”是表示目的的，例如：
    （一）资产阶级的共和国，外国有过的，中国不能有，因为中国是受帝国主义压迫的国家。（毛）
    （二）先进的人们，为了使国家复兴，不惜艰苦奋斗，寻找革命真理。（毛）这两个词，一般地说，是很容易分别的，可是下面这两句里用错了：
    （三）我们才来这村的时候，因为更容易了解情况，便决定轮流到各家吃饭。（作）
    （四）为了经济困难，我今年寒假不能回家。（作）（三）的“因为”应该改做“为了要”，（四）的“为了”应该改做“因为”。有时候一句话可以用“因为”，也可以用“为了”，可是说法不一样。
    （五）为了没有饭吃，他到一个农家去打杂，于是又认识了农民。（书）这里的“为了”用错了，该用“因为”。如果用“为了”，该说“为了找饭吃”。
    “为了”和“因为”还有一点不同：“因为”的后面可以是一个句子形式，“为了”的后面只能是一个短语，并且必须跟主要动词属于同一主语，表示主动者的目的。例如：
    （六）还有人想到台上去讲话，然而为了游艺节目的继续演出，被主席暂时抑止下去了。（报）“被主席”该改做“主席把他”，否则“为了”就好像表示被抑止的人的目的了。
    由于。  “由于”和“因为”是一样的意思，可是现在大家特别爱用“由于”，因此它的用法也值得我们特别注意。“由于”的用法可以就下面这几句来观察：
    （七）由于人们的阶级地位各有不同，人们的社会本质也各有不同。（刘少奇）
    （八）由于政权领导者的地位，领导者威信的提高就容易产生骄傲情绪，在党内党外拒绝批评，压制批评。（报）
    （九）北京的家庭手工针织业，由于资力薄弱，既不能储备原料，又不能储备产品，多是现做现卖。（报）
    （十）装载军火的美国船只抵达比利时安特卫普时，由于该港工人的抗议，无法卸货，只得转运他处。（报）第一，“由于”后面可以是一个名词，如（八），或是一个句子形式，如（七）和（九），或是一个介乎二者之间的主谓短语，如（十）。其次，由“由于”带头的短语或分句，可以放在句子的头上，如（七）和（八），或是插在中间，如（九）和（十）。这都是单用“由于”的句子，有别的虚字跟它配合的句子底下另外讨论。
    “由于”是表示原因的，用“由于”最容易犯的大毛病就是“有因无果”，“由于”变了没着落。例如：
    （一一）到了北京之后，一方面由于各革命学校都已开学，没法进去；另一方面也由于我对革命的认识不够，在我的思想上还存在着轻视短期学校、害怕改造的观念。在这种情况之下，我转入北京师范大学。
    （一二）由于上海工作情况复杂，工作的面很广，由于缺乏大城市工作经验，许多问题由于系统林立，缺乏周密的考虑，仓猝从事，以致让下面生硬地去进行。（报）（一一）的错误很明显，只要把两句合成一句，去掉“在这种情况之下”，在“转入”的上面加个“就”字就对了。（更好的改法是去掉“由于”和“也由于”，两句还是分开。）（一二）的前两个“由于”无着落。改法是把“许多问题”挪在“以致”下面。可是不知道这样是否作者原来的意思，如果作者只把“系统林立”和“下面生硬地去进行”作为一因一果，就还得给前面两个“由于”找着落。
    其次，“由于”的位置有时也有关系。像这一句：
    （一三）由于她父母的思想腐旧，竟然将女儿严管起来，不让随便出外。（信）很可能叫人误会“由于”一直管到“出外”，那就变了有因无果。即使读者知道“由于”只管到“腐旧”，“将女儿严管起来”也还缺主语。把“由于”移在“的”字的位置上，问题就解决了。不过这一句，严格说，并不含因果关系，严管女儿只是思想腐旧的一种表现，“由于”根本可以不要（“的”字当然跟着取消）。
    还有一种毛病，就是把“由于”当“由”用。我们说“由你决定”“由他支配”，不说“由于你决定”“由于他支配”。这个“由”是“让”或“被”的意思，和“由于”不能混为一谈（跟“对”等于“对于”不一样）。下面这三句的“由于”都应该是“由”：
    （一四）由于媚美，进而媚日。（期）
    （一五）美帝在直接实行其侵略行动的时候，首先选中了朝鲜，正是由于朝鲜的战略地位所决定的。（期）
    （一六）电影《红旗歌》决定了这样的主题，就是：由于一个女工在解放前后的思想转变，说明今天的民主管理工厂的方法之不同于旧时的官僚主义管理方法。（期）（一四）的逗号也要去掉。（一五）的“所”字本来就不该有。（一六）的“决定”也不妥，大约作者的意思是“采取”或“选择”。
    结果。  “结果”的正确用法可以用下面两个例句来代表：
    （一七）只好在分娩后三天，到平望当奶妈，结果饿死了自己的孩子。（期）
    （一八）编辑部每期进行检讨的结果，每期都稍有改进。（期）（一七）的“结果”等于说“这件事情的结果是”。（一八）也可以用“是”字去代那个逗号。凡是不能这样解释的句子，那里面的“结果”就有问题。例如：
    （一九）经过他从各方面调查研究的结果，发现了主要病根原来在这里。（信）
    （二十）我们缜密分析的结果，认为有下列的主要根源。（期）
    （二一）中国人民在过去一年中为幸福生活自力奋斗的结果是有伟大成就的。（期）（一九）的“的结果”可以去掉。（二十）改做“经过缜密分析，我们认为”。（二二）的“的结果”更加是多余的。
    “使”。  我们首先要记住，“使”字是个动词，是需要有主语的，无论是一个词，一个短语，或者就是紧接在它前头的句子。现在人特别爱用“使”字，有时候找不出它的主语，有时候找出来了，意思讲不通，有时候讲也讲得通，但是“使”字并非必要。现在分几种情形来举例。第一类：
    （二二）经过了这一次的教训，使我以后报导新闻的态度严谨了。（稿）
    （二三）通过参干运动，又使我真正体验到了什么是真正的男女平等。（期）
    （二四）今天能看见这条正路并踏上它，使我感到说不出的兴奋。（报）
    （二五）其次是学习了马克思、列宁、斯大林的著作后，才使他慢慢的学到了正确的立场和方法。（期）这些句子的“使”字似乎可以说是拿前面的短语做它的主语。可是再看一看，前面的动词“经过”“通过”“看见”“学习”等也就是后面的三个“我”和一个“他”的行为，那末去掉“使”字，岂不爽快些，连贯些？（二三例的“又”移到“我”之后，二五例的“才”移到“他”之后。）
    第二类例子：
    （二六）在不断的思想教育下，使部分同学转变过来了。（作）
    （二七）在这次苏南的土地改革中，使我们深深领会到……。（期）
    （二八）由上所述，使我们看出地主们破坏土地改革的方式是多种多样的。（期）
    （二九）从同志们的热情招待与上级的关心中，使我们这些人觉得就如到了自己家庭一样，毫无一点生疏。（报）这里的“在……下”“在……中”等显然不适宜做“使”的主语，那末“使”字就没有主语了。把它去掉怎么样呢？很好，比原来好的多——除了（二九），这句也许应该留“使”字，去掉“从”和“中”。
    另外有一类句子，那里面的“使”字也用得不妥，或不顶好。
    （三十）使六千五百余亩田地及大量的房屋农具分配到贫雇农手里。（期）
    （三一）新社会将给妇女，特别是母亲们种种帮助，使得足以阻碍她们进步的一切因素消除。（期）
    （三二）我们站在人民的立场，发现政府工作人员的错误，就要设法使他们纠正。（信）
    （三三）丁政委的这种学习态度使全校同志都受到很大的影响。（报）前两句的“使”和“使得”应该改做“把”。（三二）应该说“设法纠正他们”。（三三）的原句不能算错，但是不如说“给予全校同志很大的影响”。
    因、果、目的的重复表示。  表示原因、结果、目的，各有适当的词语可用，上面各节已经分别讨论。实际上又常常看见把不同的词语配合起来用的句子，用得好可以把这些关系交代得更清楚，用得不好就不免重复和累赘。底下分类举例。第一类是“原因是因为”式。例如：
    （三四）洋灰工厂的生产成绩之所以能突飞猛进，其原因之一是因为宣传鼓动工作做得好。（稿）
    （三五）该公司负责人曾表示：业务增进的原因，主要是由于投资后公司资金充足。（报）
    （三六）教育团员与同学明确地认识到学习的目的是为了学到各种国防、经济、文化建设知识，以服务祖国，服务人民。（期）这里每句用一个实词和一个虚字来表示同一个意思，不但重复，也讲不通：某一件事情是因为什么或为了什么，是讲得通的；“原因”因为，“目的”为了，是讲不通的。（三四）宜改为“其原因之一是”。（三五）宜改为“主要的原因是”，或“业务增进，主要是由于”。（三六）宜改为“目的在于”。
    第二类是“因为……的原故”和“由于……的结果”。例如：
    （三七）群众之所以拥护这个制度是因为这个制度是按照群众付出的劳动的质量与数量付给适当报酬的原故。（稿）
    （三八）由于美帝国主义大规模军事动员的结果，据杜鲁门一月十六日向议会提出的预算咨文显示，美国一九五二会计年度的财政预算高达七百一十五亿九千万美元。（期）“因为……的原故”等于“因为……这个原故”是讲得通的。“由于……的结果”就讲不通了，美国预算庞大是由于大规模军事动员，不是由于大规模军事动员的“结果”，这个“结果”就是“预算庞大”这件事实。这两种说法虽然有这么个差别，重复和累赘是相同的，能不用最好不用。
    第三类是“因为……所以”式。“因为”只和“所以”配合，“由于”之后也有跟“所以”的，但是最常见的是“因此”和“因而”。例如：
    （三九）因为期限短促，所以工程的质量很差。（报）
    （四十）由于领导她小组的陆师傅对于妇女学习开火车没有信心，不肯耐心帮助，所以孙桂兰、宋桂香、王兰英三人的进度很慢。（报）
    （四一）由于中国机制工业生产不足，还不能满足广大农村的日用品的需要，因此其中很大部分仍然依靠手工业来供应。（报）按语言经济的原则说，有了“因为”就不必再“所以”，有了“所以”就不必再“因为”，可是有时候为了把因和果这两部分的界限划分清楚，免除误解，需要用了“因为”再用“所以”。如（四一），假如不用“因此”，“由于”就可以一直管到底，再接个“因此我们要把手工业组织起来，把它的效率提高”。可是如果把“因为……所以”“由于……因此”变成口头禅，到处都是成双作对，就未免失之于滥了。像（三九）的“所以”就可以去掉，（四十）也不妨在“由于”和“所以”里头省去一个（看你把重心放在哪个分句上）。
    第四类是“因为……使”式。例如：
    （四二）由于这种错误的看法，便使我走错了路迳。（作）
    （四三）过去数千年中，因为受历来统治者“大汉族主义”的专横统治，使藏民生活在痛苦的深渊里。（期）我们上面说过，“使”字是个动词。可是有时候“使”的主语就是前面的句子形式，例如“天气变化太快，一天里会有春夏秋冬四季，使外面来的人难于适应”。这个“使”字就多少带有虚字的性质。因此也就常常被人用来和“因为”或“由于”配合。但是细想起来，这是不大好的。假如“因为”或“由于”底下需要有字跟它呼应，最好是用虚字，不要用实字。明明有“所以”和“因此”在，就不必再去拉“使”字来应差。用了“使”字，我们就会给它找主语。像（四二），很可以用“错误的看法”做“使”的主语，那末就不必用“由于”；用了“由于”就不必用“使”（“便”改“就”，挪在“我”字后）。像（四三），“使”字前面的一个动词是“受”，“受”的主语（省略）是“藏民”，顺着下来，也成了“使”的主语，“藏民使藏民”怎么讲得通呢？去掉“使”字就很好了。
    第五类是上一类的变式，不用“使”而用“造成”或“引起”。例如：
    （四四）由于以上情况，造成了城乡对立，城市剥削乡村。（作）
    （四五）由于反动派这样对工人血腥的屠杀，引起了全上海人民普遍的愤怒。（报）这两句都应该把“由于”去掉。这个格式再一变就成了这样：
    （四六）事故的发生，是由于管理人员和工人经常违犯保安规程、生产纪律废弛和干部之间不团结造成的。（书）这里似乎是把“由于”和“由”混淆了（比较十五例），可是如果把“由于”改做“由”，也还不很好，不如留“由于”，去掉“是”和“造成的”。
    以下是连用三个这一类词语的例子：
    （四七）像冀南、冀中、河南、陕西等主要产棉区，都因为在战争期中对外交通特别困难的原故，使棉田大为减少了。（期）
    （四八）用历史的事实证明了自然科学由于它自身发展的结果，使形而上学的世界观成为“必须摈弃的东西”。（报）
    （四九）由于教会学校这一套思想教育的结果，养成了青年学生的崇美思想。（报）
    （四七）去“的原故”和“使”。（四八）改为“由于自然科学的发展，形而上学……”或“自然科学自身的发展使形而上学……”。（四九）去“由于”和“的结果”。
