	   Rural Marriage Problems in Newspapers of the Central and Southern Regions
　　On June 2nd, the "Reader's Letters" section of the Changjiang Daily published several incidents related to rural marriage issues. Among them was the case of Chen Jianxun, the township head of the 16th Township of the 2nd District of Daye, Hubei, who illegally interfered with the remarriage of a widow named Lan Xinu. The township head ordered militiamen to arrest Lan and subject her to beatings, resulting in her death. Another case involved Xu Rongzhi, a woman from the 10th District, who, unable to bear the abuse, requested a divorce. Her husband, Huang Zuxing, cut her leg tendons with a kitchen knife. The local government not only did not punish the murderous husband but instead held a mass meeting to denounce Xu Rongzhi for requesting a divorce. After these two cases were published in the newspaper, they attracted the attention of relevant authorities in the Central and Southern regions. On July 24th, the newspaper published the verdicts, sentencing Chen Jianxun to death and Huang Zuxing to three years in prison. Other individuals involved in the cases were also given corresponding punishments. The Changjiang Daily pointed out in its short commentary, "Resolutely Fight Against Feudal Remnants": "...For such criminals, we advocate: they must be appropriately and severely punished. All feudal remnants must be made to wake up and must be forced to understand that suppressing or depriving women of their freedom of marriage is illegal and should be feared." In the Central and Southern regions, there are still many such incidents of illegally harming women who seek freedom of marriage. According to statistics from the Central and Southern Ministry of Justice, in the year from the promulgation of the Marriage Law in May 1950 to May 1951, the total number of women in the Central and Southern regions who were abused, murdered, or forced to commit suicide due to marriage issues was over 10,000. This is a noteworthy figure! However, some judicial cadres adopt an irresponsible attitude towards the verdicts in such cases. The Jiangxi Daily's article "Several Issues Concerning the Implementation and Thorough Enforcement of the Marriage Law" on July 25th mentioned that in Jiangxi, "the Provincial Court reviewed a total of 951 civil judgments in the first five months of this year, of which more than 80 percent were divorce judgments. The vast majority of these were filed because women could not bear the abuse. Some courts simply granted the divorce. Some governments and courts only sentenced murderers of women to two or three months of labor or released them..." Sentencing murderers of women to only a few months of labor is tantamount to condoning those barbaric feudal remnants. Such judgments can never have a deterrent effect.
	Xu Xiaobing, Wu Benli, Zhou Libo, and others donate their Stalin Literary Prize money
　　Xu Xiaobing, Su Heqing, Zhou Feng, Wu Benli, Li Hua, and Xu Lai, Chinese filmmakers who won the Stalin Prize for Literature and Art for their participation in the production of the films "The Victory of the Chinese People" and "Liberated China," donated a total of 100,704,620 RMB of their prize money to purchase the "People's Cinema" airplane.
	They unanimously stated: The successful completion of these two magnificent films should first be attributed to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all the Chinese people who directly used their blood and sweat to overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and create the glorious deeds recorded in these two films. The fact that these two films were able to win a prize named after the most glorious name in the world—Stalin—is not only the glory of a few filmmakers but the glory of all the Chinese people. Therefore, when the people of the whole country are enthusiastically donating airplanes and artillery for the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, they have decided to donate all of their prize money, except for a small portion to pay Party dues and reward those who participated in the production of the two films, to purchase the "People's Cinema" airplane.

	"Study," "Translation Bulletin," and other publications pay attention to strengthening book review work
　　Book review work has been significantly strengthened in some general and specialized periodicals recently published.
	Currently, many authors' attitudes are very unserious. It is necessary to conduct a rigorous struggle against this bad tendency. The "Book Review" column newly opened in the eighth issue of the fourth volume of "Study" magazine, in addition to introducing Eugene's "On Socialist Construction" and Leontiev et al.'s "On Socialist Political Economy," criticized two bad books: "A History of Chinese People's Literature" (written by Jiang Zuyi, published by Beixin Bookstore) and "A History of the Chinese People's War of Liberation" (written by Zong Ze, published by Yunhai Publishing House). The author of the former book does not understand what Marxism is at all but insists on using dialectical materialism to promote himself; he also does not understand what people's literature is at all, yet calls his book "A History of People's Literature." The author of the latter book does not understand politics or war but crudely and absurdly writes a "history book" with very bad content. The fifth issue of the fourth volume of "New Construction" also published two book reviews: "On the Object of Statistics and Its Scientific Basis" criticized the major fundamental errors of Gou Shisheng's "Principles of Statistics" based on Marxist-Leninist statistical theory, pointing out the necessity of uncompromising struggle against bourgeois or other anti-Marxist-Leninist statistics. A book review titled "Historical Distortion" sternly criticized "The Powerful Minister Liang Ji" (written by Wu Fangping, published by Kaiming Bookstore) for not grasping the viewpoint and method of historical materialism and not seriously applying this viewpoint and method to study and analyze Chinese history. The article "Review of 'Soviet Education'" (translated by Lin Judai, published by Commercial Press) in the third issue of the third volume of "People's Education" pointed out that the content of the book is permeated with the bourgeois formal logic method and revisionist theory. The translator and author are obviously promoting anti-Soviet and anti-Marxist ideas for American imperialism.
　　The phenomenon of shoddy work in translation work has also attracted the attention of the criticism community. The first issue of the third volume of "Translation Bulletin" strengthened the criticism of translated books. It made correct criticisms of three translations of "State Law of People's Democratic Republics" (translated by Dang Fengde et al., published by Xinhua Bookstore in December 1950, translated by Lei Mingzhe et al., published by Zhengfeng Publishing House in October 1950, "The Birth and Development of People's Democratic States", translated by Zhu Huang, published by Datong Bookstore in November 1950, "Textbook of State Law of People's Democratic Republics"), "The Story of Dzerzhinsky" translated by Wei Shimin et al., published by Guangming Bookstore in December 1950, "People with Pure Hearts" translated by Zhang Duosheng, published by Tangdi Publishing House in April 1950, and "Alexei's Travels" translated by Qiu Ling, published by New Asia Bookstore. Among them, except for the Xinhua Bookstore version of "State Law of People's Democratic Republics," which has fewer errors, the other books have serious and intolerable errors.
　　The seventh issue of the second volume of "Science Bulletin" published Mei Yanxin's "Introduction to 'Trial Materials of Former Japanese Army Soldiers'" (published by the Moscow Foreign Literature Publishing Bureau). The author of the article pointed out the sharp struggle between the two camps and two kinds of science in the world, and profoundly criticized the fallacy that "science has nothing to do with politics."
	The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Training Class for Language Cadres Opens
　　The Training Class for Language Cadres, organized by the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, opened in Beijing on July 31. The director of the training class is concurrently held by Luo Changpei, the director of the Institute of Linguistics. There are 32 students in total, including 17 students who were admitted through examinations and 15 students who were recommended by relevant agencies, including students from ethnic minorities such as Miao, Yi, Mongolian, Manchu, Zhuang, and Minjia. The training period is tentatively set for six months. After graduation, in addition to a few people who will return to their original agencies to assist in language work, the rest will be led by staff from the Institute of Linguistics to investigate and study the languages of ethnic minorities in various ethnic minority areas, and assist ethnic minorities in improving their original writing systems or promoting the pinyin schemes for various languages formulated by the Institute of Linguistics.

            中南区报纸上的农村婚姻问题
    六月二日的长江日报读者来信版发表几篇有关农村婚姻问题的事件，其中有湖北大冶二区十六乡乡长陈建勋非法干涉寡妇蓝细女再婚问题，该乡长让民兵抓来蓝氏加以吊打，竟致死命；另外一案是十区妇女徐蓉芝因不堪虐待而要求离婚，被其丈夫黄祖兴用菜刀割断腿筋，地方政府不但不惩处持刀杀人的凶夫，反而开群众会斗争要求离婚的徐蓉芝。这两个案件在报上刊出后，引起中南各有关机关注意，七月二十四日报纸刊出判决结果，处陈建勋以死刑，黄祖兴三年徒刑，与案件有关人员亦分别给予处分。长江日报在短评“坚决与封建残余分子作斗争”中指出：“……对这种犯罪分子，我们主张：必须适当地严厉地予以惩戒。必须让一切封建残余分子清醒过来，必须强迫他们懂得压制或剥夺妇女的婚姻自由是违法的，而有所恐惧。”在中南区，这种非法残害要求婚姻自由的妇女的事件还很多。据中南司法部的统计，自一九五○年五月婚姻法公布以后至一九五一年五月的一年间，中南各地妇女因婚姻问题而被虐杀或被迫自杀的总数在一万人以上。这是一个值得注意的数字！但是有些司法干部对这类案件判决却采取不负责的态度，七月二十五日江西日报《关于执行与贯彻婚姻法的几个问题》一文中提到江西“省法院今年五个月中共审核民事判决书九五一件，其中百分之八十以上为离婚判决书，绝大多数是因为妇女不堪虐待而提出离婚的，有些法院仅判决离婚了事。也有的政府和法院对杀害妇女的凶手，仅处二、三个月的劳役或释放。……”对杀害妇女凶手仅处几个月劳役，无异纵容那些野蛮的封建残余分子。这种判决是决不能发生制裁作用的。
            徐肖冰、吴本立、周立波等捐献所得斯大林文艺奖金
    参加《中国人民的胜利》、《解放了的中国》两部影片摄制工作而获得斯大林文学艺术奖金的中国电影工作者徐肖冰、苏河清、周峰、吴本立、李华、徐来等六人，捐献所得奖金共一亿零七百零四万六千二百元，作为购买“人民电影号”飞机之用。
    他们一致表示：这两部辉煌的影片的摄制完成，首先应归功于伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席，和直接用自己的血汗推翻帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义而创造出这两部影片所纪录的辉煌事迹的中国人民解放军和全中国人民。这两部影片之能获得以世界上最伟大、最光辉的名字——斯大林的名字来颁发的奖金，不仅是几个电影工作者的光荣而是全中国人民的光荣。因此当全国人民都在轰轰烈烈为抗美援朝捐献飞机、大炮的时候，他们特把所得的奖金，除少数作交纳党费和酬谢曾参加拍摄两部影片工作的人员的开支外，完全捐出，以购买“人民电影号”飞机。

            《学习》《翻译通报》等刊物注意加强书评工作
    书评工作在最近出版的某些综合性、专门性的期刊中有了显著的加强。
    目前有很多作者的态度是很不严肃的。对这种恶劣倾向进行严正的斗争是必要的。《学习》杂志四卷八期新增辟的书报评论栏，除介绍了尤金的《论社会主义建设》及列昂节夫等著的《论社会主义政治经济学》二书外，批评了两本坏书：《中国人民文学史》（蒋祖贻著、北新书局出版）和《中国人民解放战争史》（宗泽著、云海出版社出版）。前书的作者根本不懂得什么是马克思主义，偏要拿辩证唯物论来标榜；也根本不懂得什么是人民文学，而把他的书叫做《人民文学史》。后书的作者不懂得政治，也不懂得战争，而粗暴地、荒谬地写出了一部内容很不好的“历史书”。《新建设》四卷五期也发表了两篇书评：《论统计学的对象及其科学基础》依据马列主义统计学说，批判了勾适生著《统计学原理》一书重大的根本的错误，指出了要和资产阶级的或其他反马列主义的统计学作不调和的斗争的必要；以《历史的歪曲》为题的一篇书评严正地批判了《豪门梁冀》（吴方平著，开明书店版）一书没有掌握唯物史观的观点和方法，没有认真地把这种观点和方法运用来研究和分析中国的历史。《人民教育》三卷三期《评“苏维埃的教育”》（林举岱译、商务印书馆版）一文，指出了该书的内容贯串着资产阶级的形式逻辑的方法与修正派的理论。译者与作者显然是在为美帝国主义宣传反苏、反马克思主义的思想。
    翻译工作中粗制滥造的现象，也引起了批评界的重视。《翻译通报》三卷一期加强了对翻译书籍的批评。它对《人民民主国国家法》的三个译本（党凤德等译、新华书店一九五○年十二月版《人民民主国国家法》，雷鸣蛰等译、正风出版社一九五○年十月版《人民民主国家的诞生与发展》，祝璜译、大东书局一九五○年十一月版《人民民主国国家法教程》），卫石民等译，光明书局一九五○年十二月版《捷尔仁斯基的故事》，章铎声译、棠棣出版社一九五○年四月版《心地纯洁的人们》和邱陵译、新亚书店版《阿列沙旅行记》都提出了正确的批评。其中除新华书店版《人民民主国国家法》错误较少外，其他各书都有严重的、令人不能容忍的错误。
    《科学通报》二卷七期发表了梅雁心的《介绍“前日本陆军军人案审判材料”》（莫斯科外国文书籍出版局出版）。该文作者指出了世界上两个阵营和两种科学的尖锐的斗争，深刻地批判了“科学与政治无关”的谬说。
            科学院语文干部训练班开学
    中国科学院语言研究所举办的语文干部训练班，于七月三十一日在北京开学。该训练班班主任由语言研究所所长罗常培兼任。学员经考试录取的十七人，有关机关保送的十五人，共三十二人，其中包括苗、彝、蒙、满、僮、民家等少数民族学员。训练期限暂定为六个月。学员毕业后，除少数人仍回原机关协助语文工作外，其余将由语言研究所工作人员领导，到各少数民族地区调查研究少数民族语文，并协助少数民族改进原有文字或推行语言研究所制订的各种语言的拼音文字方案。
