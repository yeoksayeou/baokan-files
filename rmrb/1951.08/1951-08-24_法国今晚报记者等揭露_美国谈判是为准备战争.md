　　French "Ce Soir" Reporter and Others Reveal:
    U.S. Negotiations are a Pretext for War Preparations
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd] French "Ce Soir" reporter Philippe Baechtold reported from Kaesong on the 21st: This morning's fifth meeting of the sub-committee in Kaesong was held in an atmosphere weighed down by the recent ambush of neutral zone patrol teams. Despite Washington's optimistic pronouncements about the progress of the negotiations, there is no factual basis for this here. These optimistic statements are used by the United States to deceive public opinion. Well-informed sources here point out that the U.S. demands have not changed; the U.S. military radio in Tokyo openly boasts that the current U.S. offensive is putting pressure on the talks; all this casts a shadow over the outcome of the negotiations. One cannot help but conclude from this that the United States is merely buying time to prepare for a new offensive. Member states of the United Nations should now ask themselves what is being done here in their name. The only non-American representative in the United Nations delegation is a South Korean general who once fought side-by-side with the Japanese army. Britain's attempts to secure a representative position here have also been in vain. Even the Australian journalist representing Reuters of Britain was replaced by German and American journalists after some time. Colonel Murray refused to allow United Nations journalists to cover the investigation of the shooting incident on Sunday. Yesterday, three United Nations journalists attended Yao Pai-chang's memorial service, but they were quickly driven away by a U.S. captain. Generals Nam Il and Deng Hua, as well as other representatives of the Korean and Chinese delegations, attended yesterday's memorial service. The dense machine gun fire, the roar of artillery, and the rumble of American planes overhead all once again emphasized the U.S. determination to solve the problem by force.
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd] According to a report from Kaesong on the 21st by Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British London "Daily Worker": Today's sub-committee meeting lasted for an hour without any progress, and the optimistic tone emanating from Washington has no basis in fact. At the time of this culminating incident of attacking the neutral zone, the issue has become increasingly clear: the United States is still insisting on territorial demands and is using the negotiation period to launch the first offensive since the armistice talks with entire divisions of troops, in order to "exert pressure," as the U.S. military radio in Tokyo said. A United Nations journalist said: "If we advance a hundred miles north, the dispute over the 38th parallel will be resolved." This statement reveals the secret of the current offensive. At the United Nations Command delegation's headquarters in Munsan, the so-called "Peace Camp," people openly stated that the talks were about showing affection to the other side while feeling around for a suitable place to stick a knife into them.

　　法国今晚报记者等揭露
    美国谈判是为准备战争
    【新华社二十三日讯】法国《今晚报》记者贝却敌二十一日自开城报道：小组委员会今晨在开城举行第五次会议，会上空气被不久前伏击中立区巡逻队的事件弄得很沉重。关于谈判的进展，华盛顿虽发表乐观的言论，但是此地并没有这种事实表现。这种乐观的言论是美国用来愚弄舆论的。此地的消息灵通人士指明，美方的要求并未改变；东京美军电台公开吹嘘美军目前的攻势是给会谈加压力；这一切又给谈判的结局蒙上了一层暗影。从这里不能不得出一个结论：美国只不过是在骗取时间准备新攻势罢了。联合国的会员国现在的确该问一问，假借它们的名义在这里搞的是些什么了。联合国代表团中唯一的一个非美国的代表，是一个曾与日军并肩作过战的南朝鲜将领。英国想在这里取得一席代表的位置，可是也徒费心机。即使代表英国路透社的澳大利亚记者。在过了一些时之后也被德国籍和美国籍记者所代替了。穆莱上校星期日拒绝让联合国记者采访射击事件的调查。昨天，有三个联合国记者参加姚排长的追悼会，他们很快就被一个美国的上尉撵走了。南日和邓华将军以及朝中代表团的其他代表参加了昨天的追悼会。密集的机枪声，大炮的吼声，头上美国飞机的隆隆声，这一切再次着重表明了美国决心用武力来解决问题。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据英国伦敦《工人日报》记者阿兰·魏宁顿二十一日自开城报道：今天小组委员会开了一小时的会议，没有获得任何进展，华盛顿发出的乐观的论调并没有事实根据。在发生这次袭击中立区的登峰造极的事件的时候，问题已经越来越清楚：美国仍然在坚持领土要求，并且利用谈判期间把整团的兵力投入停战谈判以来的第一次攻势，以便如东京美军电台所说的“施展压力”。一名联合国记者说：“如果我们向北推进一百英里，关于三八线的争论就解决了。”他这句话把当前攻势的秘密给泄露出来了。在汶山所谓“和平行营”的联合国军代表团驻地，人们直言无讳地表示会谈是一面向对方表示亲热，一面却在他身上摸出一个适当的地方以便把刀子刺进去。
