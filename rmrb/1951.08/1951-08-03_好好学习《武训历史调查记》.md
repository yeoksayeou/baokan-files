　　Study "The History Investigation of Wu Xun" Carefully

For more than two months, I have read many articles about criticizing "The Story of Wu Xun" and Wu Xun. Although I have a relatively clear understanding of Wu Xun's reactionary face, I always mistakenly felt that Wu Xun's environment was not good, and the revolution at that time was in a "low ebb," so he should not be compared with the current revolutionaries. In addition, due to the influence of "The Story of Wu Xun," I mistakenly thought that Wu Xun still had some revolutionary atmosphere. It was not until I read "The History Investigation of Wu Xun" serialized in the "People's Daily" this time that I truly realized his reactionary essence.

In Xiaoliuguan Village, seven miles away from Wu Xun's hometown, there was a peasant revolution led by Song Jingshi. In Wang'erzhai, two miles away from Xiaoliuguan Village, more than sixty people participated in the Black Flag Army, the revolutionary team led by Song Jingshi. From here, we can see that all the revolutionary peasants at that time participated in the revolutionary armed forces, but Wu Xun not only did not devote himself to this mighty revolutionary wave, but ran around, kowtowing and kneeling to the landlord class, begging for money, and willingly being a running dog of the landlord class.

"The History Investigation of Wu Xun" clarified my wrong thoughts. Therefore, I hope that all readers who, like me before, have wrong ideas about Wu Xun, will study this document carefully and re-recognize Wu Xun.

### 好好学习《武训历史调查记》

　　好好学习《武训历史调查记》
    近两个多月来，我阅读了许多关于批判《武训传》及武训的文章，对于武训这个人的反动面目，虽然有了比较清楚的认识；但总错误地觉得武训所处的环境不好，那时的革命趋于“低潮”，因此不应拿他与现在的革命者相比。另外，我由于受了《武训传》的影响，更误认为武训多少还有些革命的气息。及至这次读了《人民日报》连载的《武训历史调查记》后，才真正地认识到他的反动的本质。
    距武训家乡七里地的小刘贯庄上，就有着宋景诗领导的农民革命。离小刘贯庄二里地的王二砦，就有六十多人参加了宋景诗领导的革命队伍——黑旗军。从这里，我们就可以看到，当时所有的革命农民都参加了革命武装，而武训这时却不但不投身于这轰轰烈烈的革命浪潮，反而跑这跑那，向地主阶级磕头、下跪、要钱，甘心做地主阶级的走狗。
    《武训历史调查记》澄清了我的错误思想。因此，我希望所有象我以前那样对武训有错误看法的读者，都好好地学习这个文件，从新来认识武训。
