　　Night Raid
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Shi Licheng
    At dusk on June 5th, a battalion of the American invading army's 1st Cavalry Division advanced northward from Lianchuan, huddled together in the mountains around Zuozan Cave. The 2nd Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, which was responsible for the blocking mission in this direction, was ordered to send a night raid team of more than twenty people to attack this enemy force, braving the drizzling rain. The night raid team passed through the enemy's two lines of artillery fire blockade and arrived at the edge of Zuozan Cave village. Enemy sentries fired a few shots and turned to run. The enemies in the battalion were startled by the gunfire and rushed out in panic. The night raid team immediately met them head-on with submachine guns, machine guns, and hand grenades. The enemies scurried around in the dark in utter chaos.
    The machine gun team of the night raid team – Pei Chunwen, Wang Bao, and Wang Fengwa – took advantage of the enemy's confusion to infiltrate the enemy's heart. Dozens of enemies scurried over in a chaotic mass. Team leader Pei Chunwen decisively shouted, "Take them down!" The machine gun roared in Wang Bao's hands, and hand grenades flew into the enemy ranks. In the flashes of the explosions, enemies fell to the ground one after another.
    The gunfire subsided, and the night raid team returned victoriously to the company, but Pei Chunwen's machine gun team remained active in the enemy's heart. Pei Chunwen ordered Wang Bao to contact the troops, while he and Wang Fengwa continued to find enemies to fight.
    Pei Chunwen, holding the machine gun, told Wang Fengwa to load bullets for him. At this moment, a group of enemies rushed towards them, and Pei Chunwen fired fiercely at this group of enemies. After twenty minutes of fighting, the enemies were once again defeated, so panicked that they didn't even have time to drag away their corpses and wounded soldiers.
    "Fengwa, feel your way forward along the roadside!" Pei Chunwen said as he walked forward with the machine gun. They climbed over stone ridges, crawled through bushes, and listened carefully to every sound. While advancing, Pei Chunwen touched something. He felt it with his hand and realized it was a machine gun; feeling further, there were bullets as well. Wang Fengwa, who was behind him, also found a submachine gun, three bullet magazines, and two hand grenades. At this moment, footsteps came from ahead. They pressed their bodies tightly to the ground, listening carefully. The heavy footsteps grew louder and louder. They agilely knelt up and suddenly opened fire on the enemies. The enemies immediately returned fire. Pei Chunwen's machine gun got hot, so he set up the machine gun he had just found to fire; when this machine gun got hot, he would grab the original one to fire again. Wang Fengwa loaded bullets while also firing his submachine gun. Wherever there was a lot of chaotic noise, they aimed their muzzles and fired. Finally, like the previous two times, the enemies left a pile of corpses and wounded soldiers behind and fled.
    The two continued to feel their way forward. "The deeper we go, the greater the victory." They groped their way up the western hilltop of Zuozan Cave, crouched under pine trees, and heard footsteps coming again. Wang Fengwa knelt up and swept his submachine gun. A hand grenade suddenly exploded in front of him, but he still fired his last magazine of bullets.
    When this battle was over, Pei Chunwen whispered, "Fengwa, it's almost dawn, let's go back!" But Fengwa didn't answer; he had already gloriously sacrificed himself. Pei Chunwen squatted beside his comrade-in-arms, holding his face in his hands, silently gazing at him in the faint dawn. The sky grew brighter and brighter. He buried his comrade-in-arms' remains under a pine tree, and then, carrying the weapons left behind by his comrade-in-arms, he passed through the pine forests and bushes and returned to the company. The American invading army, which they had attacked for an entire night, was busy the next day rounding up stragglers and transporting more than a hundred corpses and wounded soldiers.
    Pei Chunwen and Wang Fengwa created outstanding achievements in this night raid. In addition to issuing a commendation to them, the leadership of the unit requested the higher authorities to approve a special-class merit for Pei Chunwen and posthumously recognized Wang Fengwa's achievements.

　　夜袭
    新华社记者  史立成
    六月五日黄昏，美国侵略军骑兵第一师的一个营，从涟川向北冒进，猬集在左赞洞四周的山地上。在这个方向担任阻击任务的志愿军某部第二连，奉命派遣一个二十多人的夜袭队，冒着蒙蒙细雨去袭击这股敌人。夜袭队通过敌人的两道炮火封锁线，到了左赞洞的村边。敌人哨兵打了几枪，扭头就跑。营中的敌人被枪声惊动了，都慌乱地冲出来。夜袭队立即用冲锋枪、机关枪和手榴弹迎头痛击。敌人在黑暗中东奔西窜，乱做了一团。
    夜袭队的机枪组——裴春文、王保、王凤娃三个人，趁敌人混乱之际，摸进了敌人的心脏。几十个敌人杂乱地窜过来了。组长裴春文果断地喊道：“干掉它！”机枪就在王保手里咆哮起来，手榴弹也飞向敌群。在爆炸的闪光里，敌人纷纷被击倒地。
    枪声稀疏下来，夜袭队胜利地回到连里去了，只有裴春文的机枪组，仍在敌人心脏中活动着。裴春文命令王保去联络部队，自己和王凤娃继续去找敌人打。
    裴春文拿着机枪，叫王凤娃给他装子弹。这时有一群敌人向他们冲了过来，裴春文就向着这群敌人猛烈射击。经过二十分钟战斗，敌人又被击溃了，他们惊慌得连尸体和伤兵也来不及拖走。
    “凤娃，绕着道边向前摸！”裴春文一边说，一边就拿着机枪向前走。他们爬上石坎，钻过草丛，静听着每一种声响。在前进中，裴春文触到一件东西，用手一摸，原来是挺机枪，再一摸还有子弹。在后面的王凤娃也摸到了一支冲锋枪，三个子弹梭子和两颗手榴弹。这时有脚步声从前面传来了。他们将身子紧贴地面，仔细听着。沉重的脚步声愈来愈响了。他们敏捷地跪起来，向敌人突然射击。敌人也立即向他们还击。裴春文的机枪打热了，就把刚才摸到的机枪架起来扫射，这挺机枪打热了就再抓起原来的那挺来打。王凤娃一边装子弹，一边也用冲锋枪射击着。那里杂乱的声音大，他们的枪口就对着那里打。最后敌人和前两次一样，丢下一堆死尸和伤兵逃跑了。
    两个人继续摸索着前进。“越摸得深，胜利就愈大。”他们摸上了左赞洞的西山头，伏在松树下，听得脚步声又传来了。王凤娃跪起来用冲锋枪扫射着。有颗手榴弹突然在他的面前爆炸，但他还是打出了最后一梭子弹。
    等到这场战斗结束以后，裴春文低声喊道：“凤娃，天快亮了，我们回去吧！”但凤娃没有回答，他已经光荣牺牲了。裴春文蹲在战友身旁，用双手把他的脸抱起来，借着微明的曙光，默默地望着。天色越来越亮了。他将战友的遗体掩埋在一棵松树底下，然后带着战友遗留下的武器，穿过松林草丛，回到了连里。被他们袭击了整整一夜的这股美国侵略军，在第二天忙着收拢散兵和搬运了一百多个死尸和伤兵。
    裴春文和王凤娃在这次夜袭中创造了卓越的战绩。该部领导机关除予以通令表扬外，并请上级批准给裴春文记了特等功，追记了王凤娃的功绩。
