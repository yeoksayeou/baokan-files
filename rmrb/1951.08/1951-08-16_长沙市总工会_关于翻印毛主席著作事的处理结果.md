　　Changsha City Federation of Trade Unions
    The Handling Result of the Changsha City Federation of Trade Unions Regarding the Reprinting of Chairman Mao's Works
    Editor:
    The letter from reader Hu Chu published in the People's Daily on July 27th, "Changsha City Federation of Trade Unions Has a Non-Serious Work Attitude, Unauthorized Addition and Deletion of Chairman Mao's Works," is factually accurate; this matter has now been resolved, and we will inform you of the course of events and the handling results.
    In May, the Changsha City Federation of Trade Unions, because the first session of the Second Changsha Municipal People's Congress was about to be held, reprinted "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" to clarify the significance of democratic governance to union employees. However, due to their non-serious work attitude, they used an early post-liberation Changsha version of "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" as the model for the reprint. After our office reviewed it, we found that there were numerous errors, and on June 4th, we notified the entire province and asked the Changsha City Federation of Trade Unions to conduct a self-criticism and recall all published and distributed books. On June 13th, the Changsha City Federation of Trade Unions sent a self-criticism to our office, admitting that this error was a concrete manifestation of "an extremely irresponsible attitude towards the people's revolutionary cause and a result of not thoroughly studying policies and laws, illustrating our weak concept of the rule of law." They also successively delivered the book to our office, and by July 26th, the number of books delivered had reached 1,240, while the remaining distributed copies are still being recalled.

### 长沙市总工会  关于翻印毛主席著作事的处理结果

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　长沙市总工会
    关于翻印毛主席著作事的处理结果
    编辑同志：
    人民日报七月二十七日发表的读者胡础的“长沙市总工会工作态度不严肃，擅自增删毛主席的著作”一信，内容是真实的；这件事现在已处理完毕，我们将事情经过及处理结果告诉你们。
    长沙市总工会于五月间，因长沙市第二届第一次各界人民代表会议即将召开，为使工会职工明了民主建政的意义，于是翻印了“论人民民主专政”。但由于他们的工作态度不严肃，以致将一本长沙市解放初期翻版的“论人民民主专政”作为翻印的范本。经我处审查后，发现其中错误百出，于六月四日即通报全省，并要长沙市总工会作出检讨，将已出版及散发的书本全部收回。长沙市总工会于六月十三日曾将检讨寄来我处，承认这种错误是“对人民革命事业极不负责的态度，是未很好研究政策、法令的结果，说明了我们法治观念不强”的具体表现。并将该书先后送缴我处，到七月二十六日止，送缴的已达一千二百四十本，其余散发的仍正在收缴中。
