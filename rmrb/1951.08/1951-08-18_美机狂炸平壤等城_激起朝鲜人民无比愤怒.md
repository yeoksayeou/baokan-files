Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th: Approximately 350 American aircraft frenziedly and indiscriminately bombed Pyongyang on the 14th, dropping hundreds of bombs in densely populated areas of the city. American jet fighters also barbarously strafed the streets with machine guns. Dozens of "Flying Fortresses," flying from outside Korea, especially from bases in Japan, first carried out systematic destruction of Pyongyang with heavy bombs. After four hours of brutal bombing, approximately 300 more jet fighters and Flying Fortresses returned to attack Pyongyang. Many Pyongyang residents were killed or wounded, many of whom were women and children.

On the same day, American aerial bandits also bombed Wonsan, Pakchon, Anju, Sariwon and other cities in Korea.

The actions of the American aerial murderers in massacring the Korean people and destroying Korean cities have aroused boundless indignation among the Korean people.

　　美机狂炸平壤等城
    激起朝鲜人民无比愤怒
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社平壤讯：美机约三百五十架于十四日疯狂滥炸平壤，在城内人口稠密的地区投弹数百枚。美国的喷气机并野蛮地以机枪扫射各街道。从朝鲜境外，特别是从日本基地飞来的数十架“飞行堡垒”，首先以重磅炸弹对平壤进行系统的破坏。在四小时的残暴轰炸后，又有三百架左右的喷气战斗机和飞行堡垒再来袭击平壤。平壤居民多人被炸死或炸伤，其中很多都是妇孺。
    同日，美国空中强盗还轰炸了元山、博川、安州、沙里院和朝鲜其他城市。
    美国空中杀人犯屠杀朝鲜人民、破坏朝鲜城市的行动，激起了朝鲜人民的无比愤怒。
