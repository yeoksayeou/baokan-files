Volunteer Army Returning Delegates in Southwest China

Volunteer Army returning delegates Ji Bingqian, Li Weiying, and Zhang Fu reported to more than 4.1 million people in various provinces and districts of the Southwest China region, traveling across mountains and rivers from early May to mid-July.

The delegates arrived in Chongqing before May Day. In the subsequent two and a half months, they visited Wanxian, Dazhu, Liangshan, Linshui, Fuling, and Beibei in the Eastern Sichuan Administrative Area; Luzhou, Zigong, Neijiang, and Leshan in the Southern Sichuan Administrative Area; Chengdu in the Western Sichuan Administrative Area; Ya’an in Xikang Province; Nanchong and Suining in the Northern Sichuan Administrative Area; Guiyang, Zunyi, Anshun, Huangping, and Xiuwen in Guizhou Province; and Kunming, Dali, Lijiang, Baoshan, Longling, Mangshi, Chuxiong, Kaiyuan, Mengzi, Gejiu, Hekou, Yiliang, Lunan, Guishan, and Xiaguan in Yunnan Province—more than thirty cities and counties in all.

The delegates received a warm welcome from people of all ethnicities and from all walks of life in various locations throughout Southwest China. Over two million people directly participated in welcoming the delegates. When Delegate Ji Bingqian arrived in Hekou County, Yunnan, a 105-year-old woman, Peng, joined the welcoming procession and personally presented a gift to the delegate. Workers in Dali County carved a statue of Chairman Mao from Dali marble and presented it to the Volunteer Army. Comrades of various ethnic minorities put on their ethnic costumes to welcome the delegates and presented precious local products such as musk, elephant tusks, and bear paws as gifts to the delegates. In Hekou City, on the border of the motherland, returning overseas Chinese held torches late into the night to welcome the delegates. They told the delegates, "We are overjoyed beyond words. Because you defeated American imperialism, we can walk with our heads held high when we are abroad." During their twenty-plus days in various parts of Sichuan, the delegates received more than 60,000 letters of appreciation written to the Volunteer Army by people from all over, as well as over 3.14 billion yuan in monetary gifts, more than 19,000 silver dollars, over 370,000 various items of appreciation, and over 1,200 silk banners presented to the Volunteer Army.

People everywhere showed their love for the Volunteer Army by strengthening the Resist America, Aid Korea work. As early as the beginning of June, workers in Kunming had already launched a patriotic production competition to increase production as a gift to welcome the returning Volunteer Army delegates. Workers in the electrical department and the maintenance department of the Yunmao Textile Factory in the city aimed to complete a production plan originally scheduled for three months in just one and a half months. The workers said, "Volunteer Army comrades risked their lives to win victory for us. We cannot sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor; we must not waste a single minute or second." Amidst the enthusiasm of welcoming the Volunteer Army returning delegates, farmers in Chuxiong County delivered their summer grain tax quotas in half a day, and each household also set out plans to increase production and make donations. After hearing the delegates' reports, students in Kunming enthusiastically signed up to apply for military cadre schools and swore an oath before Chairman Mao's portrait: "We will learn from our Volunteer Army brothers and become glorious soldiers defending our motherland." Jidi Yihe, a Yi youth from Xikang, reported to the delegates on the changes in the lives of the Yi people since liberation a year ago, saying, "The Yi people have begun to live a good life, which is inseparable from your heroic fighting, defending the motherland, and sacrificing your blood." He hoped that the delegates would tell the Volunteer Army soldiers at the front lines about the lives of the Yi people after liberation, so that the soldiers would be even happier and more motivated. Sani farmers in the Guishan area of Yunnan Province expressed their determination to strengthen production to support the Volunteer Army. People of all ethnic groups in the area issued the same oath to the Volunteer Army delegates: "We are your reserves, your logistics department, and the assistant farming teams for your families. Whatever you need, we will give you."

While in Kunming, the delegates also broadcast to overseas Chinese compatriots in Southeast Asia. After listening to the delegates' reports, returning overseas Chinese in Kunming, in addition to planning to participate in donating a "Overseas Chinese" airplane, also proposed to strengthen unity and publicize the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army to overseas Chinese.

    志愿军归国代表嵇炳前、李维英和张甫，从五月初到七月中旬，跋山涉水，向西南区各省、区的四百一十多万人民作了报告。
    代表们在“五一”前夕到达重庆，在以后的两个半月中，他们先后到了川东区的万县、大竹、梁山、邻水、涪陵、北碚，川南区的泸州、自贡、内江、乐山；川西区的成都；西康省的雅安；川北区的南充、遂宁；贵州省的贵阳、遵义、安顺、黄平、修文；云南省的昆明、大理、丽江、保山、龙陵、芒市、楚雄、开远、蒙自、个旧、河口、宜良、潞南、圭山、下关等三十余市县。
    代表们在西南各地，获得了各民族各界人民的热烈欢迎。各地直接参加欢迎代表们的人民总计有二百多万。嵇炳前代表到达云南河口县时，一位一百零五岁的彭老太太也参加了欢迎的行列，并亲自向代表献礼。大理县的工人，用大理石雕刻了毛主席的像，献给志愿军。各地少数民族的同胞，穿上他们的民族服装来欢迎代表们，并把名贵的土产——麝香、象鼻、熊掌等送给代表们作礼物。在祖国边疆的河口市，归国华侨们在深夜里举着火把来欢迎代表们。他们对代表们说：“我们心里说不出的高兴。由于你们打败了美帝国主义，我们在国外走起路来也觉得扬眉吐气了。”代表们在四川各地的二十多天中，收到了各地人民写给志愿军的慰问信六万多封，献给志愿军的慰问金三十一亿四千多万元，银元一万九千多枚，各种慰问品三十七万多件，锦旗一千二百多面。
    各地人民都以加强抗美援朝工作来表示对志愿军的热爱。早在六月初，昆明市工人即以开展爱国生产竞赛、提高生产来作为欢迎志愿军归国代表的献礼。该市云茂纺织厂修机间电器部和保全部工人，要以一个半月的时间完成原定三个月完成的生产计划。工人们说：“志愿军同志用生命为我们夺取胜利，我们不能坐享其成，一分钟一秒钟也不能白白放过。”楚雄县的农民，在欢迎志愿军归国代表的热潮中，半天内交齐了夏征公粮，每户并订出了增产捐献的计划。昆明市学生在听过代表们的报告之后，踊跃地报名投考军事干部学校，他们在毛主席像前宣誓：“要向志愿军哥哥学习，做一个保卫祖国的光荣战士。”西康彝族青年吉狄依和向代表们报告了解放一年来彝族人民生活的变化，他说：“彝族人民开始过着美好的生活，是与你们英勇善战，捍卫祖国，流血牺牲分不开的。”他希望代表们把彝族人民解放后的生活情形告诉前线的志愿军战士们，让战士们更高兴，更鼓劲。云南圭山区的撒尼族农民，表示要加强生产来支援志愿军。当地各民族人民都向志愿军代表发出同样的誓言：“我们就是你们的后备队，是你们的后勤部，是你们家属的助耕队，你们要什么，我们就给什么。”
    代表们在昆明时，并向东南亚华侨同胞作了广播。在昆明的归国华侨，听了代表们的报告之后，除计划参加捐献“华侨号”飞机外，并提出要加强团结；把志愿军的英勇事迹对海外侨胞宣传。
