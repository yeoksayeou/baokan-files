A Letter from Home
Written by Liang Yulong

(I) Wang Zhilong, a first-class meritorious serviceman of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, received a letter from his mother from Long'an Village, Liujie Township, Guanxian County, Western Sichuan. The letter told him about the happy life at home after the land reform, and encouraged Wang Zhilong to build upon his achievements and win greater glory for the motherland and the people.

(II) Wang Zhilong's mother wrote in her letter: On the Dragon Boat Festival this year, Wang Zuozhou next door told me that you had rendered first-class meritorious service to the people on the Korean front. I was so happy that I couldn't sleep for several nights.

(III) In the past few days, the township's Farmers' Association cadres and peasants have been coming to my house to congratulate me, as if attending a fair. County Magistrate Guo also personally brought a banner to celebrate your achievements. Uncle Gan, who has been worried about you since you were a child, and Ninety-three-year-old Grandma Yang Si also came from more than ten miles away, leaning on their crutches.

    （一）中国人民志愿军某部一等功臣王治龙，接到他妈妈从川西灌县柳街乡龙安村的来信，告诉他家里翻身后生活愉快的情况，勉励王治龙功上加功，为祖国与人民争取更大的光荣。
    （二）王治龙母亲的信上说：今年端阳节那天，隔壁王佐周告诉我说你在朝鲜前线给人民立了一等功。我听了高兴得几夜没有睡着觉。
    （三）几天来，乡上的农会干部和农民，好像赶场一样，每天不断地到我家里来道喜，郭县长也亲自带着锦旗来庆功。打小就心疼你的甘大爹和九十三岁的杨四奶奶也扶着拐杖从十多里外赶来了。
