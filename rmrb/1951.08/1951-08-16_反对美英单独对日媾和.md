　　The United States will convene the so-called San Francisco Conference on September 4th, preparing to sign a separate peace treaty with Japan based on the one-sided draft peace treaty with Japan announced by the U.S. and British governments. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, issued a solemn statement on August 15th to oppose this. Minister Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the 475 million people of the People's Republic of China, announced to the world: "The draft peace treaty with Japan proposed by the U.S. and British governments is a draft that violates international agreements and is fundamentally unacceptable," and "The San Francisco Conference is also a conference that abandons international obligations and is fundamentally unrecognisable."
    The separate peace treaty with Japan activity, spearheaded by the United States government and with the British government as its main follower, is an important step by U.S. imperialism in preparing for a new war in Asia; its purpose is to accelerate the rearmament of Japan in an open and "legal" form, to serve as a tool for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Asia. China and the Soviet Union have repeatedly and resolutely expressed their opposition to the U.S. separate peace treaty with Japan and have repeatedly proposed the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan; the U.S. government has completely disregarded the proposals of China, the Soviet Union, and other countries that support a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, and resolutely implements its war policy. This war policy of the United States is directly opposed to the people of China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries, and seriously damages the interests of the Japanese people; therefore, the peace treaty with Japan, which aims to rearm Japan, is unacceptable to the people of China, the Soviet Union, and all Asian people.
    The U.S. and British governments' hostile attitude towards the Chinese people has been more blatant and absurd in the draft peace treaty with Japan and the measures taken to convene the San Francisco Conference than ever before. The draft peace treaty with Japan unilaterally drafted by the U.S. and British governments and the unilaterally convened San Francisco Conference openly exclude the People's Republic of China from the Allied powers that fought against Japan. It is absurd to exclude the Chinese people, who suffered the longest from Japanese imperialist aggression, fought against Japan for the longest time, and sacrificed the most, from the issue of the peace treaty with Japan.
    Another absurdity in the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan is that the U.S. and British governments have actually tampered with the history of the War of Resistance Against Japan in their so-called draft peace treaty with Japan. In Articles 15 and 17 of their draft peace treaty with Japan, regarding the handling of the property and rights and interests of the Allied countries and their nationals in Japan during the war, it is stipulated that the war period should only be calculated from December 7, 1941. Can the heroic War of Resistance Against Japan and the sacrifice of countless lives and property of the Chinese people during the ten years from September 18, 1931 to December 7, 1941, especially during the four years from July 7, 1937 to December 7, 1941, be written off?!
    The U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan also completely obliterates China's rights on the sacred territorial issues of the People's Republic of China that must be resolved in the peace treaty with Japan. Although the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan stipulates that Japan renounces all rights to Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, it does not stipulate that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands should be returned to China in accordance with the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. The United States is now arming and occupying Taiwan and intentionally making the ownership of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands ambiguous in the peace treaty with Japan, attempting to steal them for a long time. Not only that, but the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan also deliberately proposes that Japan renounce all rights to the Xisha Islands and the Nansha Islands, but does not mention a word about the ownership of these islands, which have always belonged to Chinese territory, which is obviously also a conspiracy.
    The Chinese people will never tolerate such hostility from the U.S. and British governments towards the Chinese people and the People's Republic of China. The legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the preparation, drafting, and signing of the peace treaty with Japan is unshakable; the great contribution of the Chinese people's long and arduous War of Resistance Against Japan cannot be erased; the sacred territorial sovereignty of the People's Republic of China over Taiwan, Penghu, and the Xisha and Nansha Islands is not allowed to be plundered.
    The U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan completely exposes the U.S. conspiracy to expand its aggression in Asia through Japan. In the "security" clauses of the U.S.-British peace treaty with Japan, the United States has made no secret of its plan to arm Japan. The U.S. and Britain recognize that Japan has the "inherent right of individual or collective self-defense and may voluntarily join collective security agreements," and do not place any restrictions on Japan's armament. This allows Japan to establish a large-scale armed force and, with the U.S.-Japan military agreement as the backbone, to join the Pacific aggression group that the United States is planning. The U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan also forces Japan to allow the U.S. military to occupy all Japanese sea, land, and air military bases and accept the U.S. military's demand for long-term "stationing or stay" on Japanese territory through so-called bilateral or multilateral agreements. In addition, it is further stipulated that Japan "should do its best to assist the United Nations (should read as the United States) in taking actions in accordance with the Charter, and should not provide assistance to any country when the United Nations takes preventive or enforcement actions against that country." This means that Japan's manpower and material resources must be completely at the service of the U.S. aggressive policy.
    If the U.S. policy of rearming Japan on a large scale is allowed to be realized, it will be a very serious new threat to the people of Asian countries. In the past War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of Asian countries suffered deeply from the aggression of Japanese imperialism, which caused unprecedented disasters in the history of Asian countries. The massacre of the people of Malaya and the Philippines by Yamashita Tomoyuki, known as the "Tiger of Malaya," is an example of the hatred that the people of Asian countries will never forget. Due to the serious damage caused by Japanese aggression, some Asian countries have not yet been able to restore their national vitality.
    U.S. and British imperialism completely ignore the contributions and sacrifices of the people of Asian countries in the war to defeat the Japanese aggressors. When the U.S. and British military forces were forced to withdraw from the Western Pacific in the early stages of the Pacific War, in Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines, Burma, Indonesia, and the entire Southeast Asia, the people of various countries persisted in arduous armed struggles against Japanese imperialism under extremely difficult conditions. Without the heroic struggles of the people of these countries, it would have been impossible for the United States to quickly switch to a counter-offensive in the Pacific. But now, the U.S. and Britain have completely obliterated the right of Asian countries to speak on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. The people of various countries resolutely oppose arming Japan, but the U.S. and Britain are determined to revive the Japanese aggressive forces. On the issue of compensation, the United States has completely adopted a dictatorial attitude. The people of Asian countries will never tolerate this arrogant behavior of the United States that disregards the interests of the Asian people and threatens the security of Asia.
    What is the significance of the U.S.-British separate peace treaty with Japan for Japan? This is a treaty of national subjugation and betrayal. The United States not only wants to control Japan militarily, but also completely control Japan politically and economically. The U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan does not contain provisions to protect the democratic rights of the Japanese people, and in fact, it is constantly strengthening its bloody fascist rule in Japan, suppressing the Japanese people's movement to strive for independence, autonomy, democracy, and freedom; this is precisely to clear obstacles for the implementation of its policy of arming Japan. In terms of economy, the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan stipulates methods for overall control of the Japanese economy. After the conclusion of the separate peace treaty, the United States will not only fully maintain the various economic privileges it has already occupied in Japan in the past, but will also further expand these privileges. The so-called "most-favored-nation treatment" and "national treatment" completely open up the Japanese economy to the United States without any cover. The U.S. monopolizes the Japanese economy, on the one hand, to extract high profits for U.S. monopoly capital, and on the other hand, to expand U.S. military production in Japan and strengthen Japan's position as a military factory for aggression against Asia. Japan's national industry and small and medium-sized enterprises, Japan's peaceful production undertakings, and Japan's normal economic and trade relations with other countries will therefore be further devastated and destroyed. The Japanese economy will become a component of the U.S. war economy. The United States attempts to make the Japanese people only have the freedom to be cannon fodder and slaves, only the freedom to starve to death under heavy military burdens, and only the freedom to be tortured under strict and extremely tense military service.
    Therefore, the separate peace treaty with Japan, which arms Japan and uses Japan as a tool of aggression, not only opposes China and the Soviet Union, endangers the security of Asian and Australian countries, and threatens peace in the Far East and the world, but will also be a great disaster for the Japanese nation and the Japanese people. In order to save the life and death of the Japanese nation, the Japanese people must strengthen their unity, fight against the invaders who enslave them, fight against the traitors who are willing to be slaves of the invaders, prevent the signing of the separate treaty of national subjugation and betrayal, and strive for the early conclusion of a comprehensive treaty that truly leads Japan to peace and happiness.
    In short, the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan is unacceptable under any circumstances. The U.S. and British governments should accept Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and convene a comprehensive conference of representatives of all countries that participated in the war against Japan with troops. If the U.S. and Britain disregard the warnings of the people of China, the Soviet Union, the people of Asia, and the people of the world and sign the peace treaty with Japan that they have arranged single-handedly, this can only indicate that they are the common enemies of the people of China, the Soviet Union, the people of Asia, the people of Japan, and the people of the world. The Chinese people will inevitably resolutely deny this pseudo-"peace treaty" and, united with the people of the Soviet Union and the people of Asian countries, will fight to the end to achieve a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan.

### 反对美英单独对日媾和

　　反对美英单独对日媾和
    九月四日美国将召集所谓旧金山会议，准备根据美英两国政府公布的片面的对日和约草案，签订单独对日和约。我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长为此于八月十五日发表了庄严的声明，加以反对。周恩来部长代表中华人民共和国四亿七千五百万人民向全世界公告：“美英两国政府所提出的对日和约草案是一件破坏国际协定基本上不能被接受”的草案，而“旧金山会议也是一个背弃国际义务基本上不能被承认的会议。”
    以美国政府为首的，以英国政府为主要追随者的单独对日媾和的活动，是美帝国主义在亚洲准备新战争的重要步骤；其目的在于以公开和“合法”的形式，加速重新武装日本，以充当美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略工具。中国和苏联曾屡次坚决表示反对美国单独对日媾和，并一再提出缔结全面对日和约的主张；美国政府完全不顾中苏两国及其他赞成对日全面和约国家的主张，坚决执行其战争政策。美国这个战争政策，直接以中国、苏联和亚洲各国人民为敌，并严重地损害着日本人民的利益；因此，以重新武装日本为目的的对日和约，是中苏两国人民和全亚洲人民所不能接受的。
    美英政府敌视中国人民的态度，在对日和约草案及召开旧金山会议的措施上，比历来表现得更加露骨，更加荒谬。美英政府擅自拟定的对日和约草案与片面召开的旧金山会议，都公然把中华人民共和国排除于对日作战盟国之外。在对日和约问题上，竟把遭受日本帝国主义侵略最长、对日抗战最久、牺牲最大的中国人民排除在外，这是荒谬绝伦的。
    美英对日和约草案中另一荒谬之处，是美英政府竟在其所谓对日和约草案中，篡改了抗日战争的历史。在他们的对日和约草案第十五条及第十七条中，关于处理盟国及其国民于战争时期在日本的财产和权益的条文中，竟规定战争时期仅应自一九四一年十二月七日算起。难道一九三一年九月十八日以后至一九四一年十二月七日以前的十年间，特别是一九三七年七月七日至一九四一年十二月七日的四年间，中国人民英勇的抗日战争和无数量生命财产的牺牲，竟可以一笔勾销吗？！
    在对日和约中必须解决的中华人民共和国的神圣的领土问题，美英对日和约草案也是完全抹煞中国权利的。美英对日和约草案虽然规定日本放弃其对于台湾和澎湖列岛的一切权益，但并未规定应遵照开罗宣言和波茨坦公告将台湾和澎湖列岛归还中国。美国现在一面武装霸占着台湾，一面有意在对日和约中把台湾和澎湖的归属含混其词，企图长期窃为己有。不仅如此，美英对日和约草案还故意提出日本放弃西沙群岛和南威岛的一切权益，却把这些向来属于中国领土的岛屿的归属一字不提，这显然也是一种阴谋。
    美英政府这样敌视中国人民，敌视中华人民共和国，中国人民是绝不能容忍的。中华人民共和国在对日和约的筹备、草拟工作和签订对日和约中的合法地位，是无法动摇的；中国人民长期艰苦对日抗战的伟大贡献，是不能抹煞的；中华人民共和国在台湾、澎湖及西沙群岛与南威岛的神圣领土主权，是不容许劫夺的。
    美英对日和约草案，完全暴露了美国通过日本扩大侵略亚洲的阴谋。在美英对日和约的“安全”条款中，美国已毫不掩盖其武装日本的计划。美英承认日本具有“单独或集体自卫之自然权利，并得自愿加入集体安全协定”，而对日本武装不加任何限制。这就是允许日本建立大规模的武装，并以美日军事协定为骨干，使日本加入美国正在筹划中的太平洋侵略集团。美英对日和约草案，并以所谓双边或多边协定，强制日本允许美军占用日本一切海、陆、空军事基地，接受美军长期“驻扎或留驻”日本领土的要求。此外，更规定日本“对于联合国（应读作美国）依宪章规定而采取之行动，应尽力予以协助，并于联合国对于任何国家采取防止或执行行动时，对该国家不得给予协助”。这就是说，日本的人力与物力，必须完全为美国的侵略政策服务。
    美国重新大规模武装日本的政策，如果任其实现，则对于亚洲各国人民是极严重的新的威胁。亚洲各国人民在过去抗日战争中，深受日本帝国主义的侵略，使亚洲各国遭受了历史上空前的灾难。被称为“马来之虎”的山下奉文，对于马来亚和菲律宾人民的大屠杀，就是亚洲各国人民永远不能忘记的仇恨的例子。由于日本侵略所造成的严重破坏，亚洲若干国家至今尚未能恢复其国家的元气。
    美英帝国主义完全漠视亚洲各国人民在击败日本侵略者的战争中的贡献与牺牲。当美英军事力量在太平洋战争初期被迫退出西太平洋的时期，在越南、在马来亚、在菲律宾、在缅甸、在印尼等整个东南亚，各国人民在极端困难的条件下，对日本帝国主义坚持了艰苦的武装斗争，没有这些国家人民的英勇斗争，美国在太平洋上迅速转入反攻是不可能的。但是现在，美英却完全抹煞了亚洲各国在对日和约问题上的发言权。各国人民坚决反对武装日本，美英却坚决复活日本侵略势力。就赔偿问题来说，美国完全采取独断的态度。亚洲各国人民对于美国这种漠视亚洲人民利益，威胁亚洲安全的蛮横的行为，决不能忍受。
    美英单独对日和约对于日本是什么意义呢？这是日本的亡国卖身条约。美国不但要在军事上控制日本，还在政治上和经济上完全控制日本。美英对日和约草案没有保障日本人民民主权利的条文，而事实上正在不断加强其在日本的血腥的法西斯统治，镇压日本人民争取独立自主、争取民主自由的运动；这正是为了实现其武装日本的政策扫清障碍。在经济方面，美英对日和约草案规定了全般控制日本经济的办法。单独和约缔结后，美国不但完全保持过去在日本所已经占有的种种经济特权，而且将更加扩张这种特权。所谓“最惠国待遇”与“国民待遇”，是把日本经济没遮拦地完全开放给美国了。美国垄断日本经济，一方面是为美国独占资本吸取高额利润，一方面是扩张美国在日本的军事生产，加强日本作为侵略亚洲的兵工厂的地位。日本的民族工业和中小企业、日本的和平生产事业、日本与其他各国的正常经济贸易关系，将因此而更加遭到摧残和破坏。日本经济将变为美国战争经济的一个构成部分。美国企图使日本人民只有当炮灰，当奴隶的自由，只有在苛重的军事负担下饿死的自由，只有在严格的和极度紧张的军事服役下被折磨的自由。
    所以，以武装日本、利用日本作为侵略工具的单独对日和约，不仅敌视中苏，危害亚澳各国的安全，威胁远东和世界和平，而且也将是日本国家民族和日本人民的大灾难。为拯救日本国家民族的危亡，日本人民必须加紧团结，同奴役他们的侵略者作斗争，同甘为侵略者奴仆的卖国分子作斗争，阻止签订亡国卖身的单独和约，争取早日缔结真正使日本走向和平安乐的全面和约。
    总之，美英对日和约草案，是无论如何不能接受的。美英两国政府应当接受周外长的声明，召开曾以军队参加对日战争的一切国家的代表的全面的和会。如果美英不顾中苏人民、亚洲人民及全世界人民的警告，签订其一手包办的对日和约，这就只能表示他们是中苏两国人民、亚洲人民、日本人民和全世界人民共同的敌人。中国人民必然坚决否认这种伪“和约”，并且和苏联人民、亚洲各国人民联合一致，为实现全面的公正的对日和约而奋斗到底。
