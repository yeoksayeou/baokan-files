TASS Report: U.S. Delays Negotiations to Prepare for Offensive

(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 9th) According to TASS, news sources with inside information say that during the Kaesong negotiations, when discussing the determination of a demarcation line to establish a demilitarized zone, the U.S. side demonstrated absolutely no intention of earnestly and quickly resolving the issue of a peaceful settlement to the Korean War. Its suggestion to determine the demarcation line far north of the 38th parallel, seizing 13,000 square kilometers of territory from northern Korea, is alone sufficient to prove that the U.S. imperialists have absolutely no desire for peace, but instead intend to continue their aggression against Korea and the Far East. The U.S. ruling clique is attempting to seize this territory and turn it into a springboard for further aggression against Korea, bringing them closer to the borders of China and the Soviet Union. One only needs to look at a map of Korea to understand why the Americans insist on determining the demarcation line in this area. Even those without military knowledge can see that this region is strategically advantageous for launching offensive operations in northern Korea. The U.S. wants to occupy this large piece of land not for defense, but for aggression.

It is worth noting that the U.S. side actually described the seizure of North Korean territory as compensation for lifting the U.S. naval and air blockade of North Korea. Isn't this argument by the U.S. ridiculous? Everyone knows that the base for launching attacks has always been land, not the ocean or the sky.

The U.S. delays negotiations while attempting to obstruct them, stemming from its desire to maintain the tense situation in the Far East. U.S. monopoly capitalists need a tense situation to expand armaments and earn huge profits.

The U.S. is making every effort to use the negotiations as a smokescreen, under which they can move reserves to the Korean front and make major preparations for another offensive. This is what prisoners of war recently captured by the Korean People's Army on the eastern front confessed.

They are interrupting meetings to prolong the negotiations, because this is beneficial to American businessmen and the so-called United Nations Command in Korea. Now, Ridgway and Van Fleet are able to make major preparations for another offensive on the Korean front, because the U.S. military's recent offensive on the eastern front in mid-July, during the Kaesong negotiations, has already failed.

　　塔斯社报道：美国拖延谈判是为准备进攻
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社平壤八日电：消息灵通的新闻界人士说，美方在开城谈判中讨论确定分界线以建立非军事区时，表现得完全不打算认真赶快地解决和平解决朝鲜战争的问题。它建议远在三八线以北确定分界线，从朝鲜北部割去一万三千方公里的土地，单单这一点就足以证明美帝国主义者绝不希望和平，而是打算继续侵略朝鲜和远东。美国统治集团力图攫取这块土地，把它变为一个跳板，以进一步侵略朝鲜，逼近中国和苏联的边境。人们只要看一看朝鲜地图，就可以明白为什么美国人坚持在这个地区确定分界线。甚至不懂军事的人也可以看出：这个地区在战略上是利于在朝鲜北部展开攻势行动的。美国要占领这一大片土地并不是为了防御，而是为了侵略。
    值得注意的是：美方竟把割取北朝鲜土地说成为对于解除美国海空军对北朝鲜的封锁所给予的补偿。美国的这种说法不可笑吗？谁都知道，向来充作进攻基地的既不是海洋，也不是天空，而是陆地。
    美国拖延谈判同时力图阻挠谈判，其出发点是希望维持远东的紧张局势，美国垄断资本家需要局势紧张，好扩充军备赚取巨额的利润。
    美方极力利用谈判，把它作为一种烟幕，在这种烟幕之下，他们好把后备军弄到朝鲜前线，大事准备另一次攻势。这是朝鲜人民军最近在东线捉到的战俘招供的。
    他们中断会议使谈判拖下去，因为这对于美国商人和在朝鲜的所谓联合国军司令部有利：现在李奇微和范佛里特能够大事准备朝鲜前线的另一次攻势，因为美军最近于七月中旬在开城谈判期间在东线进行的一次攻势已经失败。
