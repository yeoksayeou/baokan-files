　　Great Prospects for the Development of Local Industry in Southwest China
　　In order to meet the large demand for industrial products from the vast number of farmers after rent reduction and land reform, the Southwest Region held its first Local Industry Conference from July 21st to 28th, which determined the future direction of development of local industry in the Southwest. The conference studied the needs of farmers for industrial products and concluded that paper, stationery, agricultural tools, fertilizers, cloth, and daily necessities were in short supply throughout the region. For example, the demand for machine-made paper has exceeded equipment capacity, and the demand for agricultural tools in Southern Sichuan has exceeded the current production volume by more than double. Therefore, the conference decided that the entire region should promptly mobilize public and private forces, cooperatives, handicrafts, etc. to vigorously develop these industries. Each province and region should invest according to its resources and manpower, and build such small and medium-sized factories according to actual conditions. When running local industries, each region should pay attention to the economic differences between regions, strive for division of labor and cooperation with each other, and oppose certain practices that disregard regional characteristics and aim too high.
　　An Important Step in Strengthening Leadership in Rural Economic Work
　　In late July, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee dispatched three rural economic survey teams to Henan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces to investigate the rural economy and primary market conditions in land reform areas. The survey teams also planned to investigate agricultural, rural sideline, and handicraft production capacity, farmers' purchasing power, farmers' living conditions, and the transaction situation of primary markets in cotton-producing areas and tobacco-producing areas in Henan and Hubei provinces, and in the Dongting Lake area and western Hunan mountainous area in Hunan province, as the basis for the people's government to guide production, lead primary markets, and lead rural economic work in the future.
　　The Shandong Provincial People's Government recently established the Shandong Provincial Rural Economic Investigation Committee and formed the Shandong Provincial Rural Economic Investigation Team, which went to various places for key investigations. The team is divided into eleven special district rural economic investigation teams, fifty rural economic investigation sub-teams, and professional investigation sub-teams for cotton, flue-cured tobacco, kenaf, hemp, sericulture, fruit trees, forestry, etc. All personnel participating in the investigation gathered in Jinan on July 17th, and after eight days of study, they set off on July 27th and 28th. This is an important step in strengthening the leadership of rural economic work.

    西南地方工业大有发展前途
    为了满足减租和土地改革后广大农民对于工业品的大量需要，西南区于七月二十一日至二十八日举行了首届地方工业会议，决定了西南地方工业今后发展的方向。会议研究了农民对于工业品需要的情况，认为纸张、文具、农具、肥料、布匹、日用百货等，在全区均呈供不应求之势。如机制纸张的需要量已超过了设备能力，农具的需要量川南区已超过目前生产量一倍以上。因此，会议决定全区应及时动员公私力量、合作社、手工业等大力发展这些工业。各省、区应根据资力与人力，按照实际情况投资，兴建这类中小型工厂。各地区在举办地方工业时应注意地区的经济差异，力求彼此分工配合，反对某些不顾地区特点和好高骛远的作法。
    加强领导农村经济工作的一个重要步骤
    中南军政委员会财政经济委员会七月下旬派出三个农村经济调查团，分别去河南、湖南、湖北三省土地改革地区，调查农村经济和初级市场情况。调查团并拟在河南、湖北两省产棉区、产烟区、湖南省的洞庭湖滨地区和湘西山区，调查土地改革后农业、农村副业、手工业生产能力、农民购买力、农民生活状况、初级市场的交易情况等，作为今后人民政府指导生产、领导初级市场和农村经济工作的依据。
    山东省人民政府最近成立了山东省农村经济调查委员会，并组成了山东省农村经济调查队分赴各地作重点调查。该队下分十一个专区农村经济调查队，五十个农村经济调查小队及棉花、黄烟、洋麻、大麻、蚕业、果树、林业等专业调查小队。参加调查工作的全体人员，七月十七日集中济南，经过八天学习后，已在七月二十七、二十八两天先后出发。这是加强对农村经济工作的领导的一个重要步骤。
