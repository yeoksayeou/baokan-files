　　Jinan Chemical Plant Workers Care for Cotton Farmers' Production
    Actively Improve Working Methods and Study Technology
    Complete 210,000 Jin of Insecticide in a Rush
    Since receiving the task of manufacturing 200,000 jin of cotton oil soap for cotton farmers at the end of May, all employees of the Jinan Chemical Plant have worked hard to rush production and have overfulfilled the task by August 9, completing more than 210,000 jin. In order to continue to supply cotton farmers' urgent needs, they are continuing to rush produce another 50,000 jin.
    In rushing this task, the plant's employees, recognizing that this was a serious task related to the lives of the broad masses of cotton farmers and the country's economic construction, have been carrying out the rush production campaign with great enthusiasm. The movement has spread to every work department. In order to supply raw materials in a timely manner, comrades in the business division voluntarily worked on Sundays and holidays, rushing to the countryside to purchase castor seeds. In purchasing raw materials in the countryside, they actively completed their tasks despite strong winds and heavy rains. For example, on one occasion, comrades such as Zhong Zhiliang returned to the factory completely soaked by the rain, but they were extremely excited because they had completed the task for the cotton farmer brothers in a timely manner. Technicians have been deeply involved in the workshop to provide specific technical guidance; especially when they read in the newspapers that some cotton farmers had already begun to pull out withered cotton plants and were preparing to plant other crops, they worked even harder, actively seeking ways to improve work methods in order to strive to supply the urgent needs of farmers in advance. For example, in terms of quality, they eliminated the phenomenon of uneven mixing, increasing the insecticidal efficacy of cotton oil soap from 88% to over 95%. When cotton oil (raw material) was in short supply, they developed a method to replace cotton oil with 30% soybean oil; when alkali powder was in short supply, they developed a method to replace alkali powder with caustic soda, thus ensuring production and timely supplying the urgent needs of cotton farmers.
    All employees not only actively produced during production hours, trying to improve product quality and quantity, but also voluntarily worked overtime to rush production. In this way, on the one hand, they could produce more cotton oil soap to supply cotton farmers in a timely manner, and on the other hand, they donated the wages earned from voluntary labor to purchase airplanes and cannons to support the Volunteer Army. Because all employees are always concerned about the lives of cotton farmers, since the launch of the rush production campaign, the first batch of 200,000 jin of cotton oil soap was overfulfilled on the 9th of this month, and then they rushed to produce another 50,000 jin to meet the urgent needs of the cotton farmer brothers.
    Thanks to the active efforts of the broad masses of workers, pesticides, sprayers, and other items were manufactured in a timely manner and sent to cotton farmers who were threatened by pests; in addition, the broad masses of cotton farmers, under the leadership of the Party and the government, launched a struggle against cotton aphids, finally eliminating the cotton aphid pests and causing most of the withered plants to begin to revive. This action fully demonstrates how earnestly the working class cares about the country's economic construction and the production and lives of farmer brothers.

　　济南化工厂职工关怀棉农生产
    积极改进工作方法钻研技术
    突击完成杀虫药二十一万斤
    济南化工厂在五月底接到为棉农制造二十万斤棉油皂的任务以来，全体职工努力突击，已于八月九日超额完成二十一万余斤。为了继续供应棉农急需，又继续在突击生产五万斤。
    该厂职工在突击这一任务中，由于认识到这是有关广大棉农的生活与国家经济建设的严重任务，因此一直以高度的热情开展突击生产运动。运动遍及到每一个工作部门。营业股同志为了及时供应原料，星期日自动不休假，赶到乡下去购买蓖麻子。他们在下乡采购原料中，不顾狂风暴雨积极完成任务。如有一次钟志良等同志回厂时，身上被雨淋得如水洗了一般，他们却因为为棉农兄弟及时完成任务而兴奋异常。技术人员们一直深入在车间具体指导技术；特别他们在报上看到有些棉农已经开始拔掉枯萎的棉株而准备另种庄稼时，他们就更加努力，积极设法改进工作方法，以争取提前供应农民急迫需要。如他们在质量方面因消灭了搅拌不匀的现象，使棉油皂的杀虫效力从百分之八十八提高到百分之九十五以上。在棉油（原料）奇缺时，研究出用百分之三十的豆油代替棉油；在碱粉奇缺时，研究出用火碱来代替碱粉，这样就保证了生产，及时供应了棉农的急需。
    全体职工不但在生产时间内积极生产，设法提高产品质量与数量，还自动的加班赶制，这样一方面可以多生产棉油皂及时供应棉农，一方面又把义务劳动所得工资捐献购买飞机大炮，支援志愿军。由于全体职工时刻关心棉农生活，因而开展突击运动以来，第一批二十万斤棉油皂任务已于本月九日超额完成，接着就又突击生产五万斤，以满足棉农兄弟的急需。
    由于广大职工的积极努力，及时地把除虫药、喷雾器等制造出来并送到正受虫害威胁的棉农手中；加上广大棉农在党与政府领导下向棉虫展开斗争，终于消灭了棉蚜虫害，并使大部枯株开始复活。这一行动，充分说明了工人阶级是如何殷切地关心国家的经济建设，关心农民兄弟的生产与生活。
