A Letter Home
By Liang Yulong

(Seven) The villagers are all well-off now. Your eldest and third elder brothers, who are carpenters, can earn more than ten catties of rice a day. Your second elder brother is at the paper mill, and he is busy every day.

(Eight) Last year, our nine mu of land yielded another bumper harvest, with an additional two hundred and fifty catties of millet. We also bought a big, fat pig. Now our family's life is getting better and better every day.

(Nine) Four days before the good news of your meritorious service arrived, your eldest sister-in-law gave birth to a baby boy. All the neighbors said we had "double happiness at the door."

    一封家信
    梁玉龙作
    （七）村里的庄稼人都宽裕了，你那做木匠活的大哥、三哥，每天可挣回十几斤米。你二哥在造纸厂，天天都不得闲。
    （八）去年，我们种的九亩地，又是丰收，多打了二百五十斤谷子；家里还买了一口大肥猪。现在我们家里的日子一天比一天好了。
    （九）你立功喜报来到的前四天，你大嫂又添了一个男娃儿。左邻右舍都说我们是“双喜临门”。
