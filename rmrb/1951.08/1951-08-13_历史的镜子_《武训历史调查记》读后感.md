　　The Mirror of History
　　——Reflections After Reading "The History Investigation of Wu Xun"
　　Chahar Province Shalingzi Farm Tang Lizhi

The "History Investigation of Wu Xun," written from a scientific historical viewpoint, is a clear and bright mirror. The more I read it and look into it, the more I feel my past foolishness and backwardness.

I studied agriculture and worked as a middle school teacher, a university associate professor, and founded private middle schools and cooperative farms. Ever since I was a university student, the ideas of being above politics and classes, along with a purely technical viewpoint, have dominated me. I considered myself "noble," "pure," "transcendent," and even "great," thinking that running education and engaging in agriculture was "non-competitive and beneficial to others." After liberation, the thing I least liked to hear was "the fundamental difference between the nature of work before and after liberation." I thought that if one were an employee of a reactionary government or a Kuomintang soldier, working for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the past and serving the people today would be fundamentally different. But for me, an agricultural technical worker, a teacher, "the fundamental difference between the nature of work before and after liberation" was entirely out of the question. Could it be that yesterday and today, in the same school, using the same natural science textbooks, teaching the same students, there would be any difference in essence? As for doing agricultural research to improve production, what kind of essential problem could there be? Moreover, I ran a private school and a private farm. What connection did this have with the reactionary government? On the contrary, I even considered myself a democrat and my thinking progressive.

After the discussion and criticism of the Wu Xun issue unfolded in the newspapers, it failed to attract my attention. I thought it was a matter for the cultural and educational circles and had nothing to do with us agricultural workers. I had neither seen the movie "Wu Xun Zhuan" nor the comic strips. Since I hadn't been poisoned by Wu Xun's ideology, why waste time reading these articles unrelated to my work?

In a chance encounter, during a break while waiting for a meeting to begin, I read a section of "The History Investigation of Wu Xun" published in the People's Daily on July 24th – "Song Jing-shi, the local peasant revolutionary leader contemporary with Wu Xun" – with the mindset of reading a martial arts novel from my childhood. The more I read, the more nervous I became. The main reason for this tension was not because the author's writing style was attractive, nor was it because the content of the story was moving, but because it touched my thinking and made me realize the error of my past position. Especially that clear map of Wu Xun's hometown was like a portrait of my hometown – Jiangpu County: the neighboring county was Liuhe, where revolutionary struggles were very intense, across the river was Nanjing, the center of reactionary rule. The road I chose was not to go to Liuhe, but to go to Nanjing. The location of the middle school and farm I founded – Qixia Mountain on the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line – was only across a river from Liuhe, less than ten miles away. The struggles of the people across the river were already raging, and the sound of gunfire was clearly audible, but I was huddled in the area of reactionary rule, boasting about "happily nurturing talents and ceaselessly singing." How was this different from Wu Xun not heading to Xiaoliu Guanzhuang but heading to Liulin Town? If there was any difference, it was that the tide of revolution had already developed closer to my school and classroom, and had already infiltrated my farm and farmhouses, but I remained deaf and blind.

I immediately found the previous day's People's Daily and carefully read the preface to "The History Investigation of Wu Xun," and in the following days, I continuously read sections (II), (III), (IV), and (V). When I looked into the mirror of history, my true form was exposed. My face kept turning red, my heart kept beating, my past self-esteem was shaken, and my past history was denied. I was afraid to meet former students again, afraid that they would point at my face and scold me. Whenever I saw comrades in the same field reading "The History Investigation of Wu Xun," I thought they would criticize me in their hearts.

Let me recall a few typical examples for self-criticism!

After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, I served as the Dean of Academic Affairs at the Nanjing Municipal First Middle School under the Kuomintang. The bad influence left on the school during the Japanese puppet regime was significant: teachers and students acted very undisciplined, and absenteeism was common. After I arrived at the school, I put forward the slogan "Use severe penalties to govern in chaotic times." In a few weeks, I dismissed some teachers who did not abide by the "system" and expelled a group of students who did not abide by the "school rules." The "order" of the school was quickly brought back to the "right track." In order to improve students' academic performance and compete with other schools, I constantly increased students' study burden, overwhelming them so that they no longer had time or energy to think about anything other than studying. Therefore, while student movements frequently occurred in other schools, the First Middle School remained calm. I was complacent, and the school authorities favored me even more, because I was encouraging students to study dead books in a disciplined manner, preparing to sit in a "sedan chair"!

At this time, the puppet Ministry of Education received many students from Japanese puppet universities and merged them into a Nanjing Temporary University at the current site of Jinling University. I was hired as an associate professor in the Agronomy Department, teaching courses such as crop breeding, biostatistics, and field techniques. By the spring of 1946, student movements frequently occurred in the school. There were strikes, petitions, the beating of Wang Shulin (director of the Temporary University), and the smashing of the Ministry of Education. I remember that eight students were imprisoned because of this. I knew very well that this was a revolutionary political struggle. I certainly looked down on those Three Youth League members who acted as henchmen, but I also couldn't stand those progressive students. What I approved of were those students who studied hard and did not care about politics. In class or after class, I often spread "above-class" purely technical viewpoints, such as "Agricultural science serves everyone the same way" and "Agricultural students should not join student movements, as long as they study theory and technology well, it will always be beneficial to the people." I remember one Sunday morning I hurried to school to teach (because of my position at the First Middle School, the Temporary University courses were scheduled for Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings). I happened to encounter a student strike and sat on the grass in front of the classroom to rest. Many agronomy students surrounded me and chatted, asking for my opinion on the student movement at that time. I avoided answering the direct questions but indirectly promoted the greatness of natural science, listing many historical heroes, generals, kings, and ministers to prove that "they were glorious at the time, but now they are gone," only scientists are beneficial and harmless to the people and can achieve merit for thousands of generations. I believed that only inventions, discoveries, and creations in natural science are eternal, and their theoretical value does not diminish with time, citing Mendel's law of heredity as proof (at the time, I had not yet recognized the errors of Mendel's theory and mistakenly believed that natural phenomena are eternal and unchanging). My words were intended to persuade the students to study hard and not participate in student movements. How naive these arguments sound now! Although I did not receive instructions or directions from the reactionary rulers of the Kuomintang, I had already conformed to their reactionary rule. Although I did not explicitly suppress the student movement, I had inadvertently assisted the reactionaries in "pacifying the student movement." When a wheel is moving forward, what prevents it from moving forward is not necessarily the reactionary pulling force backward, but often the unevenness of the road surface. Am I not one of the grains of sand that creates resistance?

Let me talk about the middle school I ran. It was because I wanted to "climb up" but couldn't, so in the spring of 1948, I combined with the reactionary feudal bullies and landlords of Qixia Temple, used the temple's houses, asked for the approval of reactionary bureaucrats as school directors, followed the various laws, regulations, and curriculum standards promulgated by the puppet Ministry of Education, and used textbooks approved by the puppet Ministry of Education to teach a group of landlords, capitalists, and at least rich peasants or petty bourgeoisie who could afford tuition, miscellaneous fees, and meals. This earned me a lot of false glory and praise at the time, and I did put all my mental energy into running the school, even using my wife's salary to subsidize the school. On the school's anniversary, someone presented two vertical scrolls with the inscription "Happily nurturing talents, teaching without discrimination." Now that I think about these two sentences, they are simply an irony to me. What "happily nurturing talents"? If it hadn't been for the liberation later, wouldn't these "talents" (at least some of them) have served the imperialist Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang? What "teaching without discrimination"? The high tuition fees are enough to show that this school was not serving the working people and the poor masses. Moreover, the vast majority of the school's teachers were landlords or fleeing landlords. Coincidentally, there were also two teachers from the Qixia Mountain Wu Xun School at that time who were teaching part-time at my school. How different was this from Wu Xun's unrighteous learning? Where was the so-called "nobility," "purity," and "greatness" of such education? "Non-competitive" – without struggle, one cannot avoid surrendering. If the interests of the reactionary ruling class are contradicted, one will not be able to serve the ruling class without suffering closure? "Beneficial to others" – beneficial to what kind of people? In a class society, trying to run education "above politics" and "above classes" is simply a daydream, deceiving oneself.

Let's look at how my cooperative farm was established: the houses and land were the property of the "Hanmin Academy" before the war, and after the war, they belonged to the "Hanmin Middle School" far away in Guilin. Collecting rent was very inconvenient. Just as we and the principal of "Hanmin Middle School," the person in charge of the original "Hanmin Academy," were old acquaintances, more than 40 teachers, friends, and classmates pooled their money, rented the property at a low price, prepared to establish the Qixia Cooperative Farm, and planned to attach a junior agricultural school. First of all, we seized the tenancy rights of the original tenant farmers and turned them into hired workers of the cooperative farm. What a "non-competitive and beneficial to others" farm! If it continued to develop, wouldn't it have gone down the Wu Xun road of merging farmers' land?

When I was at the Nanjing Municipal First Middle School, two of my middle school classmates (Zhu Suhua from the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Bai Xia, who became the district chief of the 11th district of Nanjing after liberation) often came to talk to me about political issues. I did not actively approach them to strive for progress, but stayed away from them. Only after liberation did I realize that both of them were Communist Party members. There were also many progressive students at the Nanjing Temporary University, and I stayed away from them all. In the summer of 1948, a group of students from Central University, Jinling University, and other schools went to Qixia Mountain to organize a summer camp and borrowed beds from my school. The monks told me: "The summer camp has political activities, and the students sang Communist songs." I also stayed away from them. After liberation, a classmate told me that the summer camp was indeed a progressive organization. In the farmhouses of the cooperative farm, I heard that people often came in the dark of night to hold meetings without lights, and I stayed away from them even more. Looking back on those years, how backward my thinking was!

Let us begin studying "The History Investigation of Wu Xun"! Understanding our past backwardness is the beginning of rapid progress in the future!

　　历史的镜子
    ——《武训历史调查记》读后感
    察哈尔省沙岭子农场  汤礼治
    用科学的历史观点，写成的《武训历史调查记》，是一面清楚明晰的镜子，我读了再读，照了再照，就越感到自己过去的愚钝和落伍。
    我是学农业的，当过中学教师、大学副教授，曾创办过私立中学和合作农场。从在大学读书时候起，超政治、超阶级思想和单纯技术观点，就一直统治着我。自命“清高”、“纯洁”、“超然”甚至“伟大”，以为办教育搞农业“与世无争，于人有益”。解放以后，最不爱听的就是“解放前后工作的本质不同”。在我想假使是一个反动政府的机关职员或国民党军人，过去为蒋匪帮工作，今天为人民服务，那本质上是大有不同；对于我，一个农业技术工作者，一个教师，“解放前后工作的本质不同”是完全谈不上的。难道我昨天和今天，在同一学校，用同一的自然科学教材，教授同一的学生，本质会有什么两样？至于作农业研究，提高生产，会有什么本质上的问题，在当时更是想不通了。况且我办的是私立学校和私营农场，这与反动政府有什么联系呢？相反的，我还认为自己是民主人士，思想是进步的。
    报纸上展开了关于武训问题的讨论和批判以后，也没能吸引我的注意。我以为那是文化教育界的事，与我们农业工作者无关。我既未看过“武训传”电影，也未看过连环画，思想上既未受武训的毒害，何必浪费时间去读这些与业务无关的文章呢？
    在一个偶然的机会，在一次等候开会的空隙时间里，我以幼年看武侠小说的心情，读了人民日报七月二十四日登载的《武训历史调查记》的一节——“和武训同时的当地农民革命领袖宋景诗。”我越读心情越紧张，紧张的原因主要的还不是因为调查记作者的文笔有吸引力，也还不是因为它的内容的情节动人，而是因为它打动了我的思想，使我体会到自己过去立场的错误。尤其是那张鲜明的武训家乡地图，无异是我家乡——江浦县的写照：邻县是革命斗争非常激烈的六合，隔江是反动统治的中心南京，我选择的路不是到六合来而是到南京去；我所创办的中学和农场的所在地——宁沪线栖霞山，和六合只有一江之隔，不足十里之遥。隔江人民的斗争当时已热火朝天，炮声清晰可闻，我却蜷伏在反动统治的区域里，自诩“乐育英才，弦歌弗辍”。这和武训不投向小刘贯庄而投向柳林镇有什么不同？假使有不同的地方，那就是革命的浪潮已经更近地发展到我的学校里和教室里，已经浸灌到我的农场里和农舍里，而我仍是充耳不闻，闭目不视。
    我随即找出前一天的人民日报仔细阅读了《武训历史调查记》的序言，并在以后的几天里连续读了（二）（三）（四）（五）各节。对着历史的镜子一照，自己的原形毕露了。我的脸不断地红，心不住地跳，过去的自尊心动摇了，过去的历史否定了。我很怕再遇到旧日的学生，怕他们会指着我的脸责备我；一见到同场的同志在看《武训历史调查记》，就以为他们会在心里批评我。
    让我回忆几件典型的事例做自我批判吧！
    一九四五年日寇投降以后，我任国民党南京市立一中教务主任。日伪时期留给这学校的坏影响很多：教员学生行动很散漫，随便缺课。我到校以后，提出“治乱世用重典”的口号，在很短的几星期中辞退了一些不守“制度”的教员，开除了一批不守“校规”的学生，学校的“秩序”很快地纳入“正轨”了。我为了提高学生的学业成绩，好和其他学校竞争，不断地加重学生的学习负担，压得学生们透不过气来，也就再没有时间和精力去思考读书以外的问题了。因此，别校学潮频起，一中则平静无波。我既自鸣得意，学校当局对我也倍加青睐。因为我是鼓励学生循规蹈矩读死书，准备坐“八抬大轿”呀！
    这时伪教育部接收了许多日伪大学的学生，在现在金陵大学校址，合并办了一所南京临时大学，我应聘任农艺系副教授，担任作物育种、生物统计、田间技术等课程。到一九四六年春，该校学潮频起，罢课、请愿、打王书林（临时大学主任），捣毁教育部，记得有八位同学因此入狱。我很知道这是个有革命性的政治斗争。我对那些甘作爪牙的三青团员们固然是看不起，但对那些进步的学生也看不惯。我所赞成的是那些死读书不问政治的学生，在课堂上或是课后，我常常传播些“超阶级”的单纯技术观点，比如说“学农业科学谁来都一样的服务”；“农科学生不要去闹学潮，只要学好理论和技术，永远是对人民有利的”等等。记得有一个星期日上午我赶往学校上课（我因一中职务关系，临大课程都排在星期六下午和星期日上午），适逢学生罢课，就坐在教室前草地上休息。许多农艺系学生围上来和我闲谈，并征询我对当时学潮的意见，我避过正面的问题不答，却又旁敲侧击地宣传自然科学的伟大，列举了历史上许多英雄豪杰王侯将相，证明“当时则荣殁则已矣”，惟有科学家对人民有利无害，可以功垂万世。我认为只有自然科学上的发明、发现和创造是永恒的，其理论的价值，不因时久而逊色，并以孟特尔的遗传法则为佐证（当时我还没有认清孟特尔理论的错误，并误认自然现象是永恒不变的）。我的这些话，就是要劝同学们用功读书，不要闹学潮。这些论调，现在想起来是多么幼稚啊！我虽然没有受国民党反动统治者的嘱托或指使，却已中了他们反动统治的心意；我虽然没有明显地压制学生运动，却已在无意地协助反动派“平息学潮”。当车轮向前进的时候，阻止它前进的不一定是向后拉的反动牵引力，而往往是路面高低不平的阻力。难道我不正是造成阻力的一粒砂石么？
    再谈我办的那所中学吧。那是因为我自己要“向上爬”又爬不上去，才在一九四八年春季结合反动的封建恶霸大地主栖霞寺僧，利用栖霞寺房屋，请批反动官僚为校董，遵照伪教育部颁布的各项法令和课程标准，采用经过伪教育部审查许可的教材，教一批能缴得起学杂膳费的地主资本家至少也是富农或小资产阶级的子弟。这在当时曾博得不少虚荣谬奖，我也的确把全副精神力量用在办学校上，甚至把我爱人的薪金，也拿来贴补学校。在学校的周年纪念时，曾有人赠送两幅立轴，题词是“乐育英才，有教无类”。如今想起这两句话，对我简直是个讽刺，什么“乐育英才”呢？假使不是后来解放了，这些“英才”（至少是其中的一部分）还不是要替帝国主义蒋匪帮服务？什么“有教无类”呢？高昂的学费，就已足够说明这学校不是为劳动人民贫苦大众服务的了；况且学校的教师绝大多数是大地主或逃亡地主，更巧的是还有两位当时栖霞山武训学校的教师在我校兼课，这和武训的不义之学又有多大差别呢？这样的教育，所谓“清高”“纯洁”“伟大”究竟在那里？“与世无争”，不斗争就不免要投降，假使与反动统治阶级的利益矛盾，不为统治阶级服务的话，能不遭受停办封闭么？“于人有益”是对于那种人有益呢？在阶级的社会里，要想“超政治”“超阶级”去办教育，岂非痴人说梦，自欺欺人。
    再看我的合作农场是怎样办起来的吧：房舍和田地都是战前“汉民学院”的校产，战后归于远在桂林的“汉民中学”所有，收租很不便，刚好我们和“汉民中学”校长、原“汉民学院”的负责人是旧相识，就由四十多位师友同学积资，以廉价承租，筹办栖霞合作农场，并拟附设一所初级农业学校。首先就夺取了原有佃农的租佃权，并使他们变为合作农场的雇工。好一个“与世无争，于人有益”的农场啊！假使再发展下去，会不走上兼并农民土地的武训道路么？
    我在南京市立一中时曾有两位中学时代的同学（中山陵园的朱苏华和解放后任南京十一区区长的柏夏）常来和我谈有关政治的问题，我没主动地靠近他们，争取进步，却远离了他们。解放后我才知道两位都是共产党员。南京临时大学里进步的同学也很多，我也都远离着他们。一九四八年的夏天，中央大学和金陵大学等校的一部分学生，到栖霞山组织夏令会，并借用了我校的床铺。寺僧告诉我：“夏令会是有政治活动的、学生们曾唱共产党歌曲。”我也远离着他们。解放后果有一位同学告诉我，那次夏令会，的确是个进步的组织。合作农场的农舍里，听说也常有人黑夜摸来，不点灯开会，我更远离着他们。回忆当年，我的思想是多么落后！
    展开《武训历史调查记》的学习吧！了解自己过去的落后，就是今后迅速进步的开始！
