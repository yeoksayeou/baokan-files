　　Introduction to Nanwei Island and the Xisha Islands
    Nanwei Island and the Xisha Islands have always been Chinese territory. They are important parts of the South China Sea Islands and the outposts of China's defense line.
    The Xisha Islands are a group of vast, low-lying coral islands and reefs. They are located between 15 degrees 46 minutes and 17 degrees 8 minutes north latitude, and 111 degrees 11 minutes and 112 degrees 54 minutes east longitude. They are about 150 nautical miles southeast of Yulin Port on Hainan Island. They can be reached by steamer in one day from Yulin Port, or by sailboat in about ten days.
    The Xisha Islands have dozens of islands and reefs, which can be roughly divided into three parts: the Xuande Islands, the Yongle Islands, and other islands and reefs. The area of each island is not large. The largest of the Xuande Islands is Yongxing Island, with an area of approximately 1,851,000 square meters. However, the Xisha Islands are very important, as they are a channel for communication between China and Southeast Asia, and a gateway for maritime traffic between Europe and Asia. The Xisha Islands also have abundant bird droppings (containing phosphorus, which can be used as fertilizer) and fish products (including abalone, sea cucumber, hawksbill turtle, sea snail, etc.), which have always been fishing grounds for fishermen from Hainan Island. For about nine years before 1927, the Japanese privately established the "Nanxing Industrial Company" on Yongxing Island, stealing about 100,000 tons of bird droppings from the Xisha Islands.
    Nanwei Island is one of the main islands of the Nansha Islands. The Nansha Islands, also known as the Tuan Sha Islands, are the southernmost archipelago of the South China Sea Islands of China. It is about 350 nautical miles south of the Xisha Islands and about 530 nautical miles from Hainan Island. It is distributed over a wide sea area, from Zengmu Ansha near 4 degrees north latitude in the south to Shuangzi Reef around 11 degrees 30 minutes north latitude in the north; from Wan'an Beach near 109 degrees 30 minutes east longitude in the west to Haima Beach around 117 degrees 50 minutes east longitude in the east. It is adjacent to the Philippines, Borneo, the Malay Peninsula, Indochina and other places, and occupies an important position in terms of transportation and military affairs.
    The Nansha Islands are also composed of many coral islands and reefs, most of which are dangerous areas and remain to be surveyed. The area of each island and reef is very small and not high above sea level. Nanwei Island is the most famous of the islands. It is located at 8 degrees 39 minutes north latitude and 111 degrees 55 minutes east longitude. The island surface is flat, about 2.5 meters above sea level, and the area is 147,840 square meters.
    The products of the Nansha Islands are mainly seaweed, sponges, sea cucumbers, cuttlefish, turtles, hawksbill turtles and other aquatic products, as well as bird droppings. This is also a fishing ground for Hainan Island fishermen. Before and during the war, the Japanese also came here to steal bird droppings. It is estimated that from 1918 to 1929, the Japanese "Lasa Phosphate Mine Company" stole 26,000 tons of bird droppings from Taiping Island (the largest island in the Nansha Islands) alone. In 1938, the Japanese "Nanyang" Company stole another 67,000 tons.
    Nanwei Island, the entire Nansha Islands, and the Xisha Islands have long belonged to Chinese territory. Chinese ancient books, since the "Song History Chronicle," have recorded the Xisha Islands. The names "Qizhou Yang," "Qili Yang," "Jiuzhou Yang," "Changsha Shidang," and "Qianli Shidang" mentioned in ancient books all refer to the current Xisha Islands. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chinese copper coins cast during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty were found about 1.5 meters below the living coral reef of the Xisha Islands, which proves that there were Chinese in the Xisha Islands as early as the Ming Dynasty. In April 1909 (the first year of Xuantong), the Qing government sent Navy Admiral Li Zhun to lead three warships, including "Fubo," to survey the Xisha Islands and other places, and fired cannons and raised flags on the islands.
    Regarding Nanwei Island and the entire Nansha Islands, fishermen from Hainan Island have frequently fished here for hundreds of years, and sometimes a few people have stayed on the island. In 1883 (the ninth year of Guangxu), the German government arbitrarily sent personnel to measure the Nansha Islands, and withdrew after protests from the Chinese government. In 1907 (the thirty-third year of Guangxu), the Chinese government sent military officials to survey the Nansha Islands and approved private groups to develop the islands. These are all historical facts that the entire Nansha Islands belong to Chinese territory.
    French imperialism has long coveted the Xisha Islands and Nansha Islands and has repeatedly attempted to seize them. As early as 1933, the French government sent a note to the Chinese Embassy in France, unreasonably arguing that China's Xisha Islands belonged to Vietnam. After the Chinese government refuted it based on sufficient facts, the French government was speechless. French imperialism even forcibly occupied the Nansha Islands by force. In 1930, France secretly sent warships to occupy my Nanwei Island. In April 1933, French warships successively occupied Anbo Sandbank, Taiping Island, Shuangzi Reef, Nanyao Island, Zhongye Island and other places in the Nansha Islands. At the same time, the French government publicly announced the possession of these islands. This act of aggression by France aroused extreme anger among the Chinese people. Under the pressure of the people, the then Chinese government protested to the French government.
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese imperialism once occupied the Xisha Islands and Nansha Islands. After Japan surrendered, the then Kuomintang government sent personnel to take over all these islands and erected stone monuments on Yongxing Island in the Xisha Islands and Taiping Island in the Nansha Islands respectively.
    American imperialism has long been intent on infringing upon China's Nansha Islands. On May 17 last year, under the instigation of the United States, Philippine puppet President Quirino falsely claimed at a press conference that the Nansha Islands "should be under the jurisdiction" of the Philippines. Quirino's arrogant remarks were immediately rebuked and warned by the Chinese people. On May 19 last year, qualified people in Beijing pointed out: "This absurd propaganda by the Philippine government regarding Chinese territory is obviously due to the instructions of the US government. Philippine provocateurs and their American supporters must abandon their adventurous plans, otherwise they will inevitably cause serious consequences. The People's Republic of China absolutely does not allow the Tuan Sha Islands (i.e. the Nansha Islands) and any other Chinese islands in the South China Sea to be infringed upon by any foreign country."
    Now, American imperialism is colluding with French imperialism, conspiring to seize China's Nanwei Island and the Xisha Islands. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

　　南威岛和西沙群岛介绍
    南威岛和西沙群岛向来都是中国的领土，它们是中国南海诸岛的重要部分，中国国防线的前哨。
    西沙群岛是一群广大的低平的珊瑚岛与礁。它的位置是在北纬十五度四十六分与十七度八分以及东经一百十一度十一分与一百十二度五十四分这一范围内。它在海南岛榆林港东南约一百五十海里，由榆林港出发，汽船一天可达，帆船约需十天。
    西沙群岛有数十个岛礁，大体可分为三部分：宣德群岛，永乐群岛，其他岛礁。各岛的面积都不大，宣德群岛中最大的是永兴岛，面积约有一百八十五万一千方公尺。但是，西沙群岛的地位很重要，它是中国与南洋的往来孔道，欧亚海上交通的咽喉。西沙群岛并有丰富的鸟粪（含有磷质，可做肥料）和鱼产（包括鲍鱼、海参、玳瑁、海螺等），向来是海南岛渔民捕鱼的地方。一九二七年以前约九年间，日本人曾私自在永兴岛设立“南兴实业公司”，偷盗西沙群岛的鸟粪约达十万吨。
    南威岛是南沙群岛的主要岛屿之一。南沙群岛又名团沙群岛，是中国南海诸岛中最南端一个群岛。它在西沙群岛之南约三百五十海里，距离海南岛约五百三十海里。它所分布的海面很广，南起北纬四度附近的曾母暗沙，北到北纬十一度三十分左右的双子礁；西起东经一百零九度三十分附近的万安滩，东到东经一百十七度五十分左右的海马滩。它邻近菲律宾、婆罗洲、马来半岛、印度支那等地，在交通上和军事上都占有重要地位。
    南沙群岛也是由许多珊瑚岛礁组成的，大部分为危险地带，尚待勘察。各个岛礁的面积都很小，拔海也不高。南威岛是群岛中比较出名的。它位居北纬八度三十九分与东经一百十一度五十五分。岛面平坦，高出海面约二公尺半，面积是十四万七千八百四十平方公尺。
    南沙群岛的物产，以海藻、海绵、海参、墨鱼、龟、玳瑁等水产以及鸟粪为主。这里也是海南岛渔民的渔场。战前及战时也曾有日本人到这里来偷盗鸟粪。据估计，一九一八——二九年，日本“拉萨磷矿公司”仅从太平岛（南沙群岛中最大的岛屿）一地就偷运了鸟粪二万六千吨。一九三八年日本“南洋”公司又偷运了六万七千吨。
    南威岛以及整个南沙群岛和西沙群岛很久以来就属于中国领土。中国古籍，自“宋史纪事本末”以来，对西沙群岛历有记载。古籍中所说“七洲洋”、“七里洋”、“九洲洋”、“长沙石塘”、“千里石塘”等名称，都是指现在的西沙群岛。抗日战争前曾在西沙群岛活珊瑚礁下约一公尺半处，发现明朝永乐年间铸造的中国铜币，这证明早在明朝西沙群岛就有中国人。一九○九年（宣统元年）四月，清朝政府曾派水师提督李准率领“伏波”等三艘军舰到西沙群岛等地去勘察，并在岛上鸣炮升旗。
    关于南威岛和整个南沙群岛，远在数百年以前，海南岛的渔民就经常不断地到这里捕鱼，有时并有少数的人留居岛上。一八八三年（光绪九年），德国政府曾擅自派员测量南沙群岛，经中国政府抗议而撤走。一九○七年（光绪三十三年），中国政府曾派军事大员勘察南沙群岛，并准私人团体开发该群岛。这些都是整个南沙群岛属于中国版图的历史事实。
    法帝国主义很久以前就觊觎西沙群岛和南沙群岛，屡图侵占。早在一九三三年，法国政府曾照会中国驻法使馆，强词夺理地说中国的西沙群岛属于越南。经中国政府根据充分的事实加以驳斥后，法国政府理屈哑口。对于南沙群岛，法帝国主义竟曾用武力强行侵占。一九三○年，法国暗自派舰侵占我南威岛。一九三三年四月，法舰又先后侵占我南沙群岛的安波沙洲、太平岛、双子礁、南钥岛、中业岛等地。同时，法国政府并公然宣布占有这些岛屿。法国这一侵略行为，激起了中国人民的极度愤怒。在人民的压力下，当时的中国政府向法国政府提出了抗议。
    抗日战争时期，日本帝国主义一度侵占西沙群岛和南沙群岛。日本投降后，当时的国民党政府派员全部接收了这些岛屿，并在西沙群岛的永兴岛和南沙群岛的太平岛分别树立石碑。
    美帝国主义早已蓄意侵犯中国的南沙群岛。去年五月十七日，在美国指使之下，菲律宾傀儡总统季里诺曾在记者招待会上妄称南沙群岛“应该辖属”菲律宾。季里诺这一狂妄谈话，当即受到中国人民的斥责与警告。去年五月十九日，北京有资格人士曾指出：“菲律宾政府对于中国领土的这种荒谬宣传，显然是出于美国政府的指示。菲律宾挑衅者及其美国支持者必须放弃他们的这种冒险计划，否则必然引起严重的后果。中华人民共和国绝对不容许团沙群岛（按即南沙群岛）及南海中其他任何属于中国的岛屿被任何外国所侵犯。”
    现在，美帝国主义又与法帝国主义狼狈为奸，阴谋侵占中国的南威岛和西沙群岛。这是中国人民所绝对不能容许的。
