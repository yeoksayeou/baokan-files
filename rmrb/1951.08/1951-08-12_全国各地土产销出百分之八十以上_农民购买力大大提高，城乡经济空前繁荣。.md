　　Guided by the policy of expanding domestic sales of native products, throughout the country, an average of over 80% of native products, accounting for 20% to 40% of farmers' total income, have been sold. As a result, farmers' purchasing power has greatly increased, and the urban and rural economies have experienced unprecedented prosperity during the spring and summer seasons, traditionally known as the commercial "off-season."

　　In the course of promoting the exchange of native products, responsible individuals from local people's governments and Party committees have personally taken action, specifically guiding relevant departments to resolve issues related to the sale of native products, such as product prices, tax procedures, tax rates, transportation, freight costs, and capital turnover. This has been a decisive factor in the widespread promotion of native product exchange over the past six months.

　　Over the past six months, the majority of native products traded throughout the country have been through long-distance exchanges between regions and provinces. Native product conferences and exhibitions have been the main marketplaces for long-distance exchanges. The quantity of native products sold at native product conferences or exhibitions generally accounts for around half of the total sales of local native products. In addition, state-owned native product companies in some provinces and regions have also sent representatives to native product distribution centers and important cities in other regions and provinces to establish native product sales offices and permanent working groups. Alternatively, they have sent native product visiting groups, composed of representatives from state-owned trade and private merchants, to promote local native products and purchase locally needed native products under the leadership of the native product companies.

　　Over the past six months, local people's governments and state-owned trading companies have also paid attention to organizing short-distance native product exchanges and leveraging the positive role of primary markets. For example, during April and May, prefectures and counties under the jurisdiction of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces organized mountain fairs, temple fairs, or mule and horse fairs. The Luohe Temple Fair in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan, averaged 500 million yuan in transactions per day, with over 700 livestock traded daily. In various forms of short-distance native product exchange, direct connections were established between producers and consumers of handicrafts and agricultural products, reducing intermediate exploitation and promptly resolving the supply of means of production and daily necessities for farmers and artisans.

　　Over the past six months, local people's governments have vigorously organized private merchants to go to the countryside to engage in the business of native products. In Shanghai, private merchants engaged in native products cover forty-seven industries. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau held a native product conference to help eleven industries organize twenty-three native product joint ventures, mobilizing 63.5 billion yuan of capital to invest in the native product business, with procurement areas spanning the entire country. In the North China region, many medicinal materials had been unsalable for a long time. After the people's government actively led private merchants to engage in their business, sales gradually opened up.

　　In order to continue implementing the policy of expanding domestic sales of native products, people's governments throughout the country are currently organizing urban and rural materials exchange guidance committees or native product promotion committees one after another, especially strengthening the leadership at the prefecture and county levels, actively organizing short-distance native product exchanges, and seeking sales channels for certain unsalable native products that may be marketable. At the same time, based on the needs of developing industrial and agricultural production and the supply and demand patterns of various native products, they have begun to systematically guide the standardization of native product specifications, improve quality, and improve packaging. In the vast rural areas throughout the country, the leadership of people's governments over primary markets is also gradually being established and strengthened. Local people's governments have also paid attention to strengthening the guidance of handicraft production to meet the higher and greater demands of farmers for production tools and daily necessities manufactured by handicrafts.

### 全国各地土产销出百分之八十以上  农民购买力大大提高，城乡经济空前繁荣。

　　全国各地土产销出百分之八十以上
    农民购买力大大提高，城乡经济空前繁荣。
    在扩大土产内销方针的指导下，全国各地占农民总收入百分之二十到四十的土产，平均已销出百分之八十以上，农民购买力因而大为提高，历来称为商业“淡季”的春夏两季，城乡经济空前繁荣。
    在开展土产交流运动中，各地人民政府和中共党委的负责人都亲自动手，具体地指导有关部门解决有关土产销路的土产价格、税收手续、税率、交通运输、运费和资金周转等问题，这是半年来土产交流广泛开展中的一个带有决定性的因素。
    半年来各地成交土产，绝大部分是区和区、省和省之间的远距离交流。土产会议和土产展览会是远距离交流的主要商场。各地土产在土产会议或展览会上销出的数量，一般都占当地土产销售总量的一半上下。此外，有些省、区的国营土产公司还派出代表到外区、外省的土产集散地、重要城市设立土产推销处、常驻小组，或者派出由国营贸易和私商代表合组的土产访问团，在土产公司领导下向外推销本地土产，收购本地所需土产。
    各地人民政府和国营贸易公司半年来还注意组织了近距离土产交流和发挥了初级市场的积极作用。如四、五月间河北、山东、河南各省所属专区和县多组织了山会、庙会或骡马大会。河南许昌专区漯河庙会平均每天成交五亿元，每天成交牲口七百头以上。在各种形式的近距离土产交流中，手工业品和农产品的生产者和消费者之间，直接建立了联系，减轻了中间剥削，及时解决了农民和手工业者生产资料和生活必需品的供应问题。
    各地人民政府半年来大力组织了私商下乡经营土产。上海经营土产的私商有四十七个行业，上海市人民政府工商局曾召开土产会议，帮助十一个行业组织了二十三个土产联营，动员六十三亿五千万元资金投入土产经营，采购地区遍及全国。华北区很多药材滞销已久，在人民政府积极领导私商经营后，已逐步打开销路。
    全国各地人民政府为了继续贯彻扩大土产内销的方针，目前正在陆续组织城乡物资交流指导委员会或土产推销委员会，特别加强专区和县两级的领导，积极组织近距离土产交流，为某些可能销出的滞销土产找寻销路。同时根据发展工、农业生产的需要和各种土产的供求规律，开始有计划地指导土产划一规格，提高品质，改善包装。在各地广大农村中，人民政府对初级市场的领导也在逐步建立和加强中。各地人民政府并已注意加强手工业生产的指导，以满足农民对于手工业制造的生产用具和生活用品的更高和更多的要求。
