In order to march north to resist the Japanese, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army victoriously advanced westward from the Jiangxi Soviet Area on October 16, 1934. After successively breaking through three lines of defense and reaching the eastern part of Guizhou Province, occupying county towns such as Liping, Shibing, Yuqing, and Jinping, the Red Army continued to advance towards the central part of Guizhou Province. However, the Wu River, known as a "natural barrier," stood in the way, blocking their path. At this time, the "Heroic Assault Red Army Fourth Regiment," the vanguard of the advance, received the order: "Overcome all difficulties and resolutely cross the Wu River at the Jiangjie River in Tuanxi!"

Speaking of the Wu River, it was indeed very dangerous. Both banks of the river were steep stone mountains, astonishingly precipitous. The dark, high peaks pierced the clouds, obscuring the sun. The river was three hundred meters wide, and the mountain peaks on both banks were protruding and sloping. There was also a place upstream of Jiangjie River that was only twenty-odd meters wide from the North Mountain cliff. The green river water flowed rushing under the mountains. The main force of warlord Wang Jialie's troops, consisting of three infantry regiments and one training regiment, had long been deployed on the cliffs on the opposite bank, and they were constructing four lines of defense day and night. Without boats, with such dangerous terrain, and the enemy bound to resist resolutely, while the warlord Zhou Hunyuan's column was closely following behind, crossing the river! Crossing the river! Quickly crossing the river! became the most urgent problem at hand!

On the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, when people were busy celebrating the New Year, the Red Army Fourth Regiment advanced towards the Jiangjie River ferry before dawn! At noon, they arrived at the bank of the Wu River. The enemy on the opposite bank discovered them and opened fire on the Red Army Fourth Regiment. The troops had to hide and carry out various preparations for crossing the river. Cadres surveyed the terrain, and soldiers conducted organizational mobilization. That night, the first "sneak crossing" began. The entire regiment selected twenty-odd comrades familiar with swimming, each carrying a Mauser pistol. The weather in the depths of winter was bitterly cold. Before departing, they drank some liquor to warm up, stripped naked, and rubbed their bodies red with towels. Then, one by one, they jumped into the water. The dark night swallowed them up, and the comrades on the shore could only hear the rushing flow of the Wu River. After a while, they suddenly heard dense gunfire from the opposite bank, shooting towards the center of the river. Because the Wu River's current was too rapid, the weather was extremely cold, and the enemy's firepower was tightly blockading the river, it was impossible to approach the opposite bank. The first "test crossing" was unsuccessful.

That night, all the commanders and fighters of the regiment were mobilized. Everyone worked together to cut bamboo and make thirty bamboo rafts. They also selected comrades who could row to be sailors, preparing for the second "sneak crossing" the next night, which was the night of the first day of the Lunar New Year.

The brave men quietly walked to the riverbank in the dark night and boarded the bamboo rafts. The first raft set off, carrying six heroes and a light machine gun, two Mauser rifles. The commander of the raft was Mao, the company commander of the Second Company. Ten minutes later, the second and third rafts followed. Before departing, the regimental commander and political commissar encouraged them and agreed that they would signal with a match once they had successfully reached the opposite bank. The comrades all wished them success. Everyone stood on the riverbank, staring intently at the opposite bank, waiting for the victory signal. But time passed second by second, and for a long time, there was no movement on the opposite bank. Had they reached the opposite bank? Were they moving forward? What difficulties had they encountered? They waited and waited, but there was no sign, like a kite with a broken string, impossible to grasp. Only after thirty minutes did a communications soldier rush to the riverbank to report: "After reaching the center of the river, the second bamboo raft was swept five miles downstream by the current and almost capsized. It has now returned." As the regimental leaders were questioning the details, the comrades on the third bamboo raft also returned. Their raft was swept two miles downstream by the current, they lost their bearings, and several times they almost capsized. As for the first bamboo raft? Its whereabouts remained unknown. Under these circumstances, they dared not blindly launch more rafts and had to think of another way. The second "sneak crossing" was also unsuccessful!

Failure, failure, repeated failures! Could the "natural barrier of the Wu River" really stop the Red Army's advance? No! The Red Army led by the Communist Party cannot be stopped by any place. After these two combat experiences, organizational mobilization was carried out again, sixty more bamboo rafts were made, and a strong firepower was organized. With the cooperation of the engineers and artillery, a large-scale "forced crossing" was launched at dawn the next day!

The advance signal blared, and the firepower of the entire Second Battalion, plus dozens of light and heavy machine guns and the regimental and divisional artillery, suddenly fired at the enemy on the opposite bank. The First Battalion served as the first assault team. Three bamboo rafts set off first under the cover of artillery fire. They rowed hard towards the enemy's direction. When they were about fifty meters away from the opposite bank, they suddenly heard a crisp machine gun sound "gagagaga" from the shore, not shooting at the bamboo rafts, but shooting towards the enemy. What was happening? It was unclear. The machine gun effectively covered the bamboo rafts approaching the riverbank. After the eighteen brave men landed, the regimental political commissar saw through his binoculars that someone was emerging from under the stone bank. The person commanding the machine gun to fire at the enemy was none other than our Company Commander Mao. It turned out that they had already reached the opposite bank on the first bamboo raft last night, but as soon as they climbed ashore, they heard the sound of metal above their heads. It turned out that the enemy was building fortifications there. The six of them hid under the enemy's feet all night, afraid to move, so how could they light a match! Only when they saw the bamboo rafts of our assault team rushing towards them the next morning did they skillfully set up the machine gun in front of the enemy and fiercely open fire. "Divine soldiers are here!" "Heavenly soldiers are here!" The enemy's morale immediately wavered. In addition, the eighteen heroes who had just landed shouted loudly and, together with the six heroes who had been ambushed on the shore, unleashed the firepower of their machine guns, launching a fierce attack, charge, and fight, and successively captured three lines of defense, leaving only one line of defense on the top of the mountain.

But at this time, the enemy completely concentrated the forces of four regiments and desperately counterattacked the Red Army. Although the Red Army's second assault team also reinforced them, they were still outnumbered and could not stop the enemy's counterattack. As a result, the first position was lost, and the second position was also recaptured by the enemy. They were compressed to the last line of defense on the riverbank. "Comrades! We can't retreat any further! Look! At our feet is the rushing water! Only by fighting will reinforcements come!" Company Commander Mao shouted excitedly, directing everyone to fight the enemy.

In this critical situation, what the brave men needed was fire support, and even more so, strong command and political work. The political commissar Yang Chengwu, standing on this side of the bank, saw this clearly through his binoculars. He called Liu, the special commissioner, Wang, the youth affairs officer, and Zhang, the staff officer, and ordered them: "Lead the third assault team to cross the river quickly!" He also instructed them: "You three, together with the battalion commander of the First Battalion and Company Commander Mao, form a temporary Party group, fight resolutely, and no matter what, defeat the enemy and consolidate the positions we have already gained!" Thus, they embarked on the bamboo rafts with the trust of the Party and the hopes of the Chinese people, tense and swiftly rushing towards the west bank. The Red Army's divine artillerymen also aimed at the enemy and fired four shots in a row, three of which accurately exploded above the enemy's heads, causing a burst of chaos among the enemy. The Red Army's reinforcing troops landed under the cover of this artillery fire and joined forces with the brave men on the shore. Immediately afterwards, they launched a fierce charge against the enemy and finally recaptured the two lost positions. Finally, they concentrated their forces and firepower to attack the enemy on the highest peak. After two hours of fierce fighting, they occupied all the enemy's last positions. The enemy was defeated and retreated towards Zunyi. After a short rest, the Red Army troops of two battalions pursued the retreating enemy. Before dawn the next day, they cooperated with the Red Army Sixth Regiment to occupy Zunyi County, an important military strategic point in northern Guizhou Province, one hundred and twenty miles from the riverbank. The comrades of the fraternal army groups celebrated this glorious victory with great joy. (According to a draft from the General Political Department News Office, slightly revised)

　　突破乌江天险
    中国工农红军为了北上抗日，在一九三四年十月十六日从江西红区胜利地向西挺进。连续突破三道防线，走到了贵州省的东边，占领了黎平、施秉、余庆、锦屏等县城后，红军又继续向贵州省的中部前进，可是，号称为“天险”的乌江横在眼前挡住了去路。这时，开路先锋的“英勇冲锋红军第四团”得到命令：“克服万难，要在团溪江界河的地方坚决打过乌江去！”
    说起乌江来，确是非常的险要。江的两岸都是峭壁的石山，陡削得惊人。黑黑的高峰突入云霄，遮蔽了天日，江水有三百米宽，两岸山峰是突出倾斜，在界河口上游还有一处与北山崖只相隔二十多米宽。碧绿的江水在山峰下哗哗的奔流。军阀王家烈的主力部队三个步兵团和一个教导团老早就在对岸峭壁上摆下了阵势，并且昼夜不停地构筑四道防御工事。没有船，地形是这样的险要，敌人又必然要坚决顽抗，而背后军阀周浑元纵队又紧紧跟着。渡江！渡江！赶快的渡江！成了当前最迫切的问题了！
    腊月三十日，正是人们忙着过年的时候，可是红军第四团在天不亮的时候就向江界河大渡口前进！正午的时候到了乌江边岸，对岸的敌人发觉了就向红军第四团开枪射击，部队只好隐蔽起来，分别进行各种渡江的准备工作；干部看地形，战士们进行组织动员。当天晚上就开始了第一次的“偷渡”。全团选出二十几个熟识水性的同志，每人试带一支驳壳枪。三九天的天气冷得要命，在出发前喝些烧酒发发热，脱光衣服，又用毛巾把全身擦红，然后一个一个跳下水去。黑茫茫的夜色把他们吞没了，在岸上的同志们，只能听到乌江的水哗哗不停的奔流。过了一会，忽然听见对岸密密的枪声，向着江中心射击。因为乌江水流的太急，天气又是非常的寒冷，再加上敌人的火力严密的封锁，无法接近对岸，第一次的“试渡”没有成功。
    那天夜里，全团指战员都动员起来了，大家都动手砍竹子做了三十个竹筏子，并且选拔会划船的同志做水手，准备在第二天晚上，也就是在大年初一的夜里作第二次的“偷渡”。
    勇士们在漆黑的夜里，轻轻地走到江岸，登上了竹筏子。第一只竹筏子出发了，上面载着六位英雄和一挺轻机枪、两枝马枪。筏子上的指挥是由二连毛连长担任的。十分钟后第二只和第三只的竹筏也跟着出发了。临出发的时候，团长、政委鼓励着他们，并和他们约定：胜利的到了对岸后要划一根火柴通知这边。同志们都预祝他们成功。大家都站在江岸上，眼睁睁的望着对岸，期待着打出胜利的信号。但是时间一秒一分的过去了，好久看不见对岸有什么动静。他们究竟到了对岸没有哩？他们正在前进吗？他们遇到什么困难吗？等了又等，没有一点影子，真像是断了线的风筝一样无法捉摸。直等了三十分钟后，才有一个通讯员匆忙地跑到江边来报告：“第二只竹筏到了江中心后，被水流冲下五里路，险些儿翻掉，现在已经回来了。”这时团首长正在追问详细情形，第三只竹筏上的同志也回来了，他们的竹筏子被水冲下二里路，摸不到方向，几次险些儿被水冲翻。至于那第一只竹筏哩？始终不知下落了。在这种情况下，不敢盲目地再放竹筏了，只好另想办法，第二次的“偷渡”又没有成功！
    失败，失败，接连两次的失败，难道“乌江天险”真能阻止红军的前进吗？不！共产党领导的红军是没有拿不下的地方的。经过了这两次的战斗经验，遂又进行了组织动员，又做好了六十只的竹筏子，并且组织了强大的火力，在工兵炮兵的配合之下，在第二天天刚麻麻亮的时候，就开始了大规模的“强渡”！
    前进号嘟嘟的响了，二营全营的火力，加上几十挺轻重机枪和团的、师的炮兵，突然间向着对岸敌人一齐射击。一营担任了第一突击队。三只竹筏子首先在炮火掩护下出发了，他们用力划竹筏子向着敌人方向猛进，离对岸约有五十米远的时候，突然听见岸上“嘎嘎嘎”响起了一阵清脆的机枪声音，不是朝着竹筏射击的，而是朝着敌人方向射击的，到底是怎么回事情？闹不清楚。机枪有力地掩护了竹筏子靠近江岸，十八位勇士登陆后，团政委在望远镜里看到石岸下钻出人来，那位指挥着机枪向敌人射击的不是别人，正是我们的毛连长啊。原来他们昨天晚上乘着第一只竹筏子已经到了对岸，但是刚刚爬上岸去，就听见在头上有铁器在响，原来是敌人在那里做工事。他们六个人就在敌人的脚下隐蔽了一夜，动也不敢动，又那能划火柴哩！直到第二天天亮，他们看见我们突击队的竹筏子直奔前来，就很敏捷地把机枪架在敌人的跟前，猛烈地向敌人开火了。“神兵来了”，“天兵来了”，敌人军心立刻动摇。再加上刚刚登陆的十八位英雄大声喊杀，并且同岸上埋伏的六位英雄，展开了机枪的火力，一阵猛攻，猛扑，猛打，就接连夺下了三层阵地，光剩下山顶上的一层防御工事了。
    但是这时敌人把四个团的兵力完全集中起来，向红军死命的反扑，虽然红军的第二突击队也增援上去了，还是寡不敌众，不能制止敌人的反扑。结果第一个阵地失守了，第二个阵地也被敌人夺回去了，我们被压缩到江岸的最后一道阵地上。“同志们！再也不能退了，看吧！脚下就是急流的水了，只有战斗，援兵就会来的！”毛连长激动地喊着，指挥着大家向敌人厮杀。
    在这千钧一发的危急情况下，勇士们所需要的是火力援助，尤其更需要坚强的指挥和政治工作。站在这边岸上的杨成武政委，从他的望远镜里完全看清楚了这一点，他把刘特派员、王青年干事和张参谋叫来，命令他们：“带领第三突击队火速的渡江！”并且还吩咐他们：“你们三个人和一营营长、毛连长组织成党的临时小组，坚决战斗，无论如何要把敌人打垮，巩固已得到的阵地！”于是，他们就带着党交付的信托，带着中国人民的希望，紧张而又迅速的登上了竹筏，箭也似的向西岸奔去。红军的神炮手们，也瞄准着敌人，连发四炮，有三炮准确的在敌人头上开了花，引起敌人一阵混乱。红军增援的部队就在这炮火的掩护下上岸了，同岸上的勇士们会合了。紧接着就向敌人猛烈冲锋，终于把失去了的两个阵地夺回来。最后，又集结兵力火力向最高峰的敌人攻击，经过了两小时的激烈战斗，把敌人的最后阵地全部占领了，敌人被打败了，向遵义溃退了。红军部队两个营稍事集结后，就向溃退的敌人进行猛追，第二天天不亮就配合红军第六团占领了离江岸一百二十里的贵州省北部重要军略据点的遵义县城。兄弟兵团的同志们都用十分高兴的心情，庆贺着这个光辉的胜利。（据总政新闻处稿，略有修改）
