On Cutting Corners by Xingshi Construction Company
    Zhang Zhizhou, Person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Company of the China Construction Enterprise Company

    During an inspection of construction projects, the Hebei Provincial Engineering Inspection Team discovered that the Shijiazhuang Xingshi Construction Company had cut corners during the construction of a three-story building for the Baoding Branch of the China Insurance Company (hereinafter referred to as the Insurance Company), and the construction did not match the design. For example, the designed wall thickness was 62 centimeters, but it was only made 52 centimeters thick; the cement foundation was originally designed to be 2 meters high and 30 centimeters thick, but it was made 1.8 meters high and 28 centimeters thick. At the same time, the grouting was insufficient when the walls were being built, or one section was grouted and the next was not. The cement and stones in the cement beams were not evenly mixed. The brick seams were uneven and irregular, which was not only unsightly, but some of the bricks were broken before the building was even completed. As a result, only two stories could be built, which ruined the original plan to build three stories. When building the Insurance Company's conference room, the roof trusses had five beams that were 12 meters long, which were worm-eaten and decayed. One of them broke when it fell. The gray soil of the wall foundation was originally designed to be 3 sections of 45 centimeters each, but one side was built to 38 centimeters and the other side to 40 centimeters, which was not only uneven but also lower than the original design. After the walls were erected, both the north and south walls flashed outward by 4 centimeters, resulting in rework and serious losses.
    This kind of corner-cutting behavior, which results in poor project quality and wastes state assets, is not tolerated by public opinion or national laws. At the same time, this kind of event should be taken as a painful lesson by the construction industry.
    Similar incidents have been happening continuously recently and have been reported in the newspapers one after another. This proves that there are still very serious problems in the construction industry. Why are these problems happening? Specifically, of course, it is because the supervisors are irresponsible and the on-site management is improper. But what is the root cause? It is necessary to study this. Now I would like to offer my personal opinion for discussion with everyone.

  The People's Construction Industry Is Fundamentally Different from the Construction Industry of the Old Society

    The people's construction industry of New Democratic China is fundamentally different from the construction industry of the old society. This is something that every comrade in our construction industry today should first understand clearly. What are the differences between them? The most fundamental difference is that in the people's construction industry, the interests of the project contractor (company) and the client are basically the same, and both are for the public interest of society. In the construction industry of the old society, both the project contractor (company) and the client were trying to squeeze the people for their blood and sweat, and were only afraid of making too little money, so they were in opposition to each other. Today, in the people's construction industry, both the client and the construction company are carrying out construction under the general premise of national economic construction. Not only must the client be responsible for state assets, but the construction company should also regard any building as the wealth of the society and the people, and be seriously responsible. In the construction industry of the old society, on public projects, the client was focused on making a lot of money for his own pocket, and the contractor was doing everything possible, even bribing officials, to get the project done poorly and make as much money as possible. Therefore, they cut corners, subcontracted at every level, and practiced serious feudal exploitation. Today, this kind of corner-cutting, subcontracting at every level, and serious feudal exploitation are the biggest obstacles and enemies to the development of the people's construction industry. We should resolutely eliminate them and never allow them to exist, whether visibly, invisibly, or in disguise, in our people's construction industry.

  On the Issue of the Construction Company's Profit

    Today, the project contracting department in our people's construction industry is an enterprise, and it should make a profit, strengthen its enterprise-based management, and develop the construction industry to strengthen the country's construction forces. This is good for national construction. However, the profit it makes should be reasonable and should be obtained from improving business management, improving technology, reducing costs, and doing a good job in economic accounting. If this principle is abandoned, it is a purely profit-making perspective. We will not discuss whether the shortcomings of the Xingshi Construction Company in undertaking the housing project for the Insurance Company were intentional, unintentional, or caused by a failure to mobilize and rely on workers. But from the specific facts of its mistakes, it committed this error. At the same time, it also showed that it was using a capitalist mode of operation to make a profit. Because the profit it made in this way did not develop the construction industry, strengthen the country's construction forces, or save state assets, but affected national construction and wasted state assets. In other words, one enterprise made a profit, but the vast majority of the people suffered a loss. Specifically, how exactly should profit be made, or where should it come from? It should be obtained from rational design, relying on workers, improving construction technology, and creating new methods to save labor and materials; it should absolutely not, and should never, be obtained by cutting corners, subcontracting at every level, and severely exploiting workers to obtain illegal profits, as was done in the construction industry of the old society. The Xingshi Construction Company attempted to obtain profits illegally, and as a result, it lost a large amount of state funds. The loss from the building alone was 60,000 jin of millet. If it were to be reworked, it would lose more than 90,000 jin of millet. This is unfavorable to the country, and what good is it to the construction company? Today, anyone who uses the bad practices of the bourgeoisie in the old society to operate socialist state-owned enterprises will inevitably run into a brick wall.

  On Strengthening Political Study and Improving Awareness

    When problems occur on the construction site, it is of course a specific work problem or a problem with working methods, but in essence, it is also a problem of political understanding and standpoint, and the attitude with which the project is being done. The specific facts of the shortcomings of the Xingshi Construction Company in building the Insurance Company's housing project are something that the people in charge of the site could not have been unaware of, and they are undeniably responsible. If we ask further, since there were people in charge of the site, why were such obvious shortcomings allowed to occur? This should be examined from the standpoint of their viewpoint and work attitude in order to find the essential cause. If the comrades in charge of construction at the Xingshi Construction Company had a clear understanding in their minds that they were a public enterprise, and at the same time were undertaking the construction of housing for a public enterprise, and were able to unite their responsibility to the Insurance Company with their responsibility to state assets, that is, to unite the interests of their enterprise with the interests of national construction, this error would not have occurred. Even if shortcomings occurred occasionally, they would have been automatically corrected immediately. The comrades in charge of construction at the Xingshi Construction Company treated the Insurance Company with a passive contractor attitude and standpoint, that is, they placed themselves outside the political task of national construction, and this kind of error was very easy to occur. For example, they only grouted when the personnel of the Insurance Company were watching, and did not grout when they were not watching. When building the conference room, the walls flashed outward a lot because there was too much fill in the room. The personnel of the Insurance Company discovered this and asked them to rework it, but they only reworked it incompletely, only tearing down the wall to the ground and not changing the footing, and shifting the big wall inward a little and then building upward, trying to bury it with soil and get away with it. Later, after inspection, they had to rework it thoroughly. Why did they take such a passive attitude? It was because they did not combine the local interests with the overall interests of the country, and regarded basic construction as a means for the unit to make a profit, without recognizing its great political significance in national construction. Therefore, we must strengthen political study, improve our political awareness, clarify our standpoint and viewpoint, and correct our work attitude. We must correct the incorrect view of some comrades in technical work who have always not paid attention to politics, or who think that "politics is politics, construction is construction, and they have nothing to do with each other." Only by recognizing the great political significance of today's basic construction and the attitude we should take can we do a better job in the construction industry.

  On the Implementation of Contracts and the Strengthening of On-Site Management

    In business operations, contracts should be treated seriously. Our construction enterprises are no exception. Once a contract has been stipulated, it should be strictly observed without exceeding its scope. Because it is equivalent to a legal provision, and violating it without reason is not allowed by national law. Otherwise, the enterprise order of New Democracy cannot be maintained.
    At the same time, in order to better implement contracts, it is necessary to strengthen the management of construction sites and establish necessary organizations and systems in the construction industry. In addition to establishing a system of dedicated responsibility, so that responsibilities are clear, a democratic management system should also be established on the construction site. For example, a construction site management committee should be organized by the site负责人, technical personnel, and worker representatives, so that the construction plan is controlled by the workers, so that workers' opinions can be adopted in a timely manner and problems can be solved. An engineering management committee should be organized by the client, the project负责人, and employee and worker representatives to connect the client, unite the workers, and decide on construction administration. If the Xingshi Construction Company had a clear understanding of the contract and a serious attitude, and executed it as stipulated, and constructed it as designed, and at the same time strictly stipulated the construction site responsibility system and established various democratic management organizations on the site that could connect the owner and mobilize the workers, the shortcomings would not have occurred or been so serious.
    On the other hand, the contract and engineering design signed by the Insurance Company and the Xingshi Construction Company also had shortcomings. The design of the Insurance Company's conference room lacked oil felt (moisture barrier); the house, which was about eleven rooms long, did not have a brick base; and the contract did not clearly stipulate grouting. According to this kind of hasty design, the consolidation and durability of the house were seriously affected. The Xingshi Construction Company planned to use 30,000 jin of millet for each building, which was much higher than the cost of building a building in general. However, when they submitted this plan to the Insurance Company for review, the Insurance Company also felt that this budget price was huge, but took an extremely unserious attitude towards state assets, and did not seriously review the budget. Instead, the two parties negotiated to add four sheds, three warehouses, and two toilets to complete the matter. What was the value of the newly added buildings? How much should the budget for the building be? They did not do any precise calculations. During the construction, the Insurance Company only sent three cadres who did not understand technology to manage the materials, and the supervision of the project was insufficient. The Insurance Company's taking such a frivolous and irresponsible attitude towards this huge construction project was also a reason for the poor quality of the project and serious waste.

  Carry out Criticism and Self-Criticism

    The mistakes and shortcomings shown by the Xingshi Construction Company in undertaking the housing project for the Baoding Insurance Branch have also occurred or existed to varying degrees in other construction companies. It is hoped that all departments and all staff members in the construction industry will seriously and painfully learn from these lessons, and actively carry out criticism and self-criticism, examine their own work, and be vigilant.

　　由兴石建筑公司偷工减料谈起
    中国建筑企业公司河北省公司负责人  张之洲
    河北省工程检查队在进行建筑工程检查中，发现石家庄兴石建筑公司在修建中国保险公司保定分公司（以下简称保险公司）三层楼房时，偷工减料，施工与设计不符。如墙厚原设计为六十二公分，只作了五十二公分；洋灰根基原设计为二公尺高，三十公分厚，结果作成一公尺八高二十八公分厚。同时，砌墙时灌浆不足，或一节灌一节不灌。洋灰梁的洋灰和石子不均匀。砖缝错综不齐，不但不美观，而且房子还没盖成有的砖就已被压断了。结果，只能盖成两层楼，破坏了原定的盖三层楼的计划。在修建保险公司会议室时，屋架木料有十二公尺长的梁五根，是虫蚀腐朽的，有一根摔下来就摔断了。墙基的灰土，原设计为三部四十五公分，结果打成一面三十八公分，另一面四十公分，不但高低不平，而且都比原设计减低。及至墙砌起后，南北两墙均外闪四公分，以致再次返工，造成严重损失。
    这种偷工减料造成工程质量低劣，浪费国家资财的行为，实为社会舆论、国家法纪所不容。同时，此种事件应引为建筑界的痛切教训。
    类此事件，近来不断发生，一连串地登在报上。这已证明，目前建筑事业上还有很严重的问题。这些问题，为什么发生的呢？具体地说，当然是监工者不负责，施工现场管理不当。但根本原因是什么呢？实有研究的必要。现在提出我个人的意见，来和大家研究。
  人民的建筑事业和旧社会的建筑事业有根本不同之点
    新民主主义的人民的中国的建筑事业和旧社会的建筑事业有着根本的不同之点，这是今天我们建筑界每个同志首先应在认识上明确起来的。它们不同之点是什么呢？最根本的是：人民的建筑事业，承作工程者（公司）和委托者利益基本上是一致的，都是为了社会公共的利益，旧社会的建筑事业承作工程者（公司）和委托者则都是为了要在人民身上榨取血汗，都只怕自己捞钱少，所以是对立的。今天人民的建筑事业，不论委托者和建筑公司，都是在国家经济建设的总前提之下，进行建筑的。不但委托者要对国家资财负责，而且建筑公司也是应该把任何建筑视为社会的人民的财富，而严肃负责的。在旧社会的建筑事业，在公家的建筑上，委托者是专心打算多捞一把钱装腰包，承办工程者也是千方百计，甚至贿赂公行把工程支应鬼混过去，多赚钱是第一着。所以他们偷工减料，层层转包，实行严重的封建剥削。今天，这种偷工减料、层层转包严重的封建剥削，是发展人民建筑事业中的最大障碍和敌人，我们应坚决地肃清它，决不容许它有形无形或变象地存在于我们人民的建筑事业中。
  关于建筑公司利润的取得问题
    我们今天人民的建筑事业中的承作工程部门，是一种企业，它应该取得利润，加强它的企业化的经营，发展建筑事业壮大国家建设力量，这是对国家建设有好处的。但是，它所得的利润应是合理的，应该是从改善经营管理、提高技术、降低成本，做好经济核算工作来取得。如果脱开这个原则，那就是单纯营利观点。兴石建筑公司在承作保险公司的房屋工程上所表现的缺点，是有意的、无意的、或是因没有很好发动和依靠工人而发生，我们姑且不论。但从其错误的具体事实上看，就犯了这个毛病。同时，也表现了是以资本主义的经营方式来取得利润。因为他这样取得了利润，不但不是发展了建筑事业、加强了国家建设力量、节省了国家资财，却是影响了国家建设，浪费了国家资财。也就是一个企业取得了利润，广大人民吃了亏。具体地说，究竟怎么作或从那里取得利润呢？那就要从设计合理，依靠工人，提高施工技术，创造新的办法，省工节料等方面去取得；绝对不是而且绝不应该按旧社会建筑业的方法，从偷工减料、层层转包和严重地剥削工人上去取得非法利润。兴石建筑公司企图非法地取得利润，其结果是损失了国家的大量资金，只是大楼一项就损失六万斤小米，如返工就要损失九万多斤小米。这对国家是不利的，对该建筑公司又有什么好处呢？今天，谁要用旧社会资产阶级的恶劣作风来经营社会主义性质的国营企业，必然会碰得头破血流的。
  加强政治学习提高觉悟问题
    施工现场上发生了问题，当然是个具体工作问题，或工作方法问题，但本质上也是个政治认识和立场观点问题，是用什么工作态度做工程的问题。兴石建筑公司此次在修建保险公司房屋工程上的缺点的具体事实，主持现场的人是不会不知道，而且是责无旁贷的。如我们再深问一句，既然有主持现场的人，为什么又能发生这样彰明较著的缺点呢？这就应从立场观点工作态度上去检查，才会找出本质的原因。如果兴石建筑公司主持现场的同志在思想上很明确地认识到自己是个公营企业，同时又是承作公营企业的房屋，而能把对保险公司负责和对国家资材负责一致起来，也即是把自己经营企业的利益和国家建设的利益一致起来，这个错误就不会发生。即偶然发生缺点，也会立即自动纠正。兴石建筑公司负责施工同志是以消极的包商态度和立场来对待保险公司，也就是把自己置于国家建设政治任务之外，这样的错误就很容易发生。如在保险公司的人员看着施工时，他们才灌浆，不看着的时候就不灌浆。建筑会议室时因房内垫土太多，墙向外闪出许多，保险公司人员发现要他们返工他们才返工，可是又不彻底返工，只把墙拆到地面，不改墙脚，把大墙往里错一点就往上盖，企图用土埋住，马虎过去。后来经过检查，才又不得不彻底返工。为什么采取这样被动的态度呢？就是因为没有把局部利益和国家整体利益结合起来，把基本建设看成本单位营利的手段，而不认识它在国家建设中的重大的政治意义。因此，我们必须加强政治学习，提高政治觉悟，明确立场观点，端正工作态度。纠正某些技术工作的同志一向不注意政治的偏向，或以为“政治是政治，施工是施工，毫不相干”的不正确看法。认清对今天基本建设事业的重大政治意义和应持的态度，才能把建筑事业做得更好。
  执行合同和加强现场管理问题
    企业经营中，对待合同应严肃。我们建筑企业也不丝毫例外。合同既经规定，应即严守不逾。因为它就等于法律规定，无故违犯合同，就是国家法律所不容许的。否则，新民主主义的企业秩序就不好维持。
    同时，为了更好地执行合同，在建筑业中必须加强对施工现场的管理，建立必要的组织和制度。除建立专责制，以便责任明确外，并应建立工地民主管理制度。如由现场负责人、技术人员与工人代表组织工地管理委员会，使施工计划为工人所掌握，以便及时采纳工人意见，解决问题。由委托者、工程负责者、职员工人代表等组织工程管理委员会，作为联系委托者、团结工人，决定施工行政工作。如果兴石建筑公司对待合同的思想明确，态度认真，怎样规定就怎样执行，怎样设计就怎样施工。同时严格的规定工地责任制，建立既能联系业主又能发动工人的各种现场的民主管理组织，缺点也不会发生或如此严重。
    另一方面，保险公司与兴石建筑公司订的合同和工程设计也是有缺点的。保险公司会议室的设计上缺少油毡（防湿层）；约有十一间长的房子，没有设计砖座；合同上也没有明确规定灌浆。按照这种草率的设计去施工，严重影响到房屋的巩固和持久。兴石建筑公司计划每间楼房需用三万斤小米，比一般修筑楼房的费用要高得多。但是，当他们把这个计划交给保险公司审查的时候，保险公司虽然也感到这个预算价格庞大，却采取了对国家资财极端不严肃的态度，不认真审核预算，而双方就协商再增盖四间敞棚、三间库房、两处厕所算完事。新增盖房舍的价值多少？到底楼房的预算应该有多少，都不去做精确的计算。在施工当中，保险公司只派了三个不懂技术的干部去管理材料，对工程监督不够。保险公司对这项庞大的建筑工程，采取了如此轻率不负责任的态度，也是造成这一工程质量低劣和严重浪费的一个原因。
  开展批评与自我批评
    兴石建筑公司在承办保定保险分公司房屋工程中表现出来的错误和缺点，别的建筑公司也或多或少地发生过或存在着。希望建筑业中所有部门和所有工作人员严重地痛切地引为教训，并积极开展批评与自我批评，检查自己的工作，警惕自己。
