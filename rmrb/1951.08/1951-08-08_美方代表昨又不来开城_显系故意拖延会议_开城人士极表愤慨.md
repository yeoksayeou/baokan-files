　　[Kaesong Dispatch, August 7th] Our reporter reports: After learning the specific content of the US side's unreasonable and arrogant demands in the military demarcation line proposal, the general public here expressed extreme indignation. The US side lacks sincerity in the negotiations, and the fact that they did not come to the meeting today even more clearly shows that they are deliberately delaying the meeting. On the morning of the 6th, our delegation again sent the reply from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Ridgway to the liaison officer of the other side at Panmunjom, the edge of the neutral zone where the two sides meet, through our liaison officer. Our delegation waited all day today, preparing for the other side to come here for a meeting, but as of 11 p.m. when this reporter dispatched the news, the other side had not yet responded. The US side has repeatedly claimed in Ridgway's previous telegrams and at the meeting that it hopes that the negotiations can reach an agreement as soon as possible so as to stop the bloodshed as soon as possible. This time, the US side not only made a fuss over this issue, using it to delay the meeting, but also delayed coming to the meeting after receiving our notification. This not only shows that the US side's words and deeds are inconsistent, but also may be attempting to come up with other tricks with ulterior motives after the deployment confusion between Ridgway and Joy. We must be highly vigilant about this.

　　美方代表昨又不来开城
    显系故意拖延会议
    开城人士极表愤慨
    【本报开城七日电】记者报道：此间一般人士获悉美方对军事分界线提案中无理狂妄要求的具体内容后，均极表愤慨。美方对谈判缺乏诚意，加以今天又不来开会，更显然是故意拖延会议。我方代表团六日晨八时又由联络官将金日成、彭德怀两将军致李奇微复文在中立区边缘双方交界的板门店送交对方联络官。我方代表团今天整日等待准备对方来此开会，但截至夜十一时记者发电时为止，对方仍延未答复。美方曾在李奇微以前电文及会场上一再宣称：希望谈判能早一天达成协议，以便早一天停止流血。此次美方在此问题上不但小题大做，借此拖延会议，且在接到我方通知后仍迟迟不来开会，不但表现美方言行不一致，而且可能企图在李奇微与乔埃间部署混乱之后，别有用心地另出花样。我们对此须严加警惕。
