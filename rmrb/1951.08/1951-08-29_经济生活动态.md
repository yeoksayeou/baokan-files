　　Factory Security Work Must Not Be Slackened!
　　After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Chongqing Private Shashi Yarn Factory developed complacency and failed to establish mass-based public security and security organizations and systems, resulting in a counter-revolutionary arson attack on a raw cotton warehouse. The arsonist counter-revolutionaries Yin Guangshun, Ran Zhiping, and Zhu Qingping have been arrested by the local public security organs.
　　The principal offender, Yin Guangshun, was the squad leader of the factory's security guard team. On July 17th, while the Shashi Yarn Factory workers were gathering to celebrate the first anniversary of the establishment of the trade union, the criminals set fire to the factory's largest raw cotton warehouse, burning more than 1,000 dan (approximately 50,000 kg) of raw cotton. Fortunately, the factory workers and nearby residents bravely rescued the warehouse, preventing the fire from spreading to other warehouses.
　　The main reason for this incident was that both the trade union and the capitalist had become complacent and neglected security work after the initial success of the anti-counter-revolutionary movement in March and April this year. The factory's trade union and leaders failed to continue strengthening security education among the workers and mistakenly believed that "anti-espionage work has already been done, the spies have been almost completely eliminated, and there are so many worker activists in the factory." Therefore, the factory's security work gradually became lax. Although the trade union had proposed to the capitalist to reorganize the factory security guard team and increase defense forces, the capitalist, fearing increased expenses, delayed for several months without resolving the issue.
　　After the incident, all the factory workers were extremely indignant and immediately assisted the public security organs in conducting investigations, quickly solving the case. All the factory workers also automatically organized patrols day and night, and proposed establishing a responsibility system to strengthen the examination of employees, in order to thoroughly eliminate lurking counter-revolutionaries. The factory's capitalist also realized the harm of counter-revolutionaries from this incident, and expressed his determination to strengthen factory security work.
　　Industrial Testing Institute Successfully Trial-Produces Ferromolybdenum
　　The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's Comprehensive Industrial Testing Institute has successfully trial-produced ferromolybdenum, using advanced Soviet experience. China's molybdenum reserves rank second in the world. Molybdenum's properties are similar to those of tungsten, and it can replace some of the tungsten in alloy steel, making the steel strong and heat-resistant. Currently, due to the lack of complete alloy smelting equipment in China, molybdenum ore can only be shipped abroad and cannot be used domestically. Recognizing the importance of manufacturing this alloy, the Comprehensive Industrial Testing Institute began researching ferromolybdenum alloys last autumn. After adopting the aluminum-silicon thermic method invented by Soviet metallurgical expert Uladin for producing ferrotungsten, it experimented for half a year and finally succeeded.

    工厂保卫工作松懈不得！
    重庆市私营沙市纱厂在镇压反革命后产生了麻痹自满情绪，未建立群众性的治安保卫组织和保安制度，致发生反革命分子纵火焚烧原棉仓库事件。纵火反革命犯尹光胜、冉治平、朱清萍等已被当地公安机关逮捕。
    主犯尹光胜是该厂厂警队班长。七月十七日，该犯等乘沙市纱厂职工集会庆祝工会成立一周年时，在该厂最大的原棉仓库纵火，烧毁原棉一千多担。幸经该厂职工及附近居民奋勇抢救，未延及其他仓房。
    造成这次事件的主要原因，是由于该厂在今年三、四月间镇压反革命运动有初步成绩，工会和资方都产生了麻痹思想，忽视保卫工作。该厂工会和工厂领导人未在工人中继续加强保安工作的教育，反而错误地认为“已经做过反特务工作了，特务已经肃清得差不多了，何况厂内还有那么多工人积极分子。”因此，厂内的保卫工作渐渐松懈起来。工会虽曾向资方提出整顿厂警队，增加防卫力量，但资方怕增加开支，拖延数月，迟迟不解决。
    事件发生后，该厂全体职工愤慨异常，立即协助公安机关进行侦察，迅速破案。全厂工人还自动组织巡逻队昼夜巡逻，并提出建立责任制，加强对职工的审查等，以便彻底肃清潜伏的反革命分子。该厂资方也从这次事件中认识了反革命分子的危害性，表示决定要加强工厂保卫工作。
  工业试验所试制钼铁成功
    中央重工业部综合工业试验所，采用苏联先进经验，试制钼铁成功。按我国钼矿储藏量占全世界第二位。钼的性能和钨相似，可代替合金钢中的一部分钨质，使钢质坚韧且耐高热。现在我国因缺少完善的合金冶炼设备，钼矿矿砂只能运送出国，不能在国内应用。综合工业试验所鉴于制造此种合金的重要性，自去秋即从事钼铁合金的研究，经采用苏联冶金专家乌拉丁氏制钨铁所发明的铝矽热法，试验了半年，终于获得成功。
