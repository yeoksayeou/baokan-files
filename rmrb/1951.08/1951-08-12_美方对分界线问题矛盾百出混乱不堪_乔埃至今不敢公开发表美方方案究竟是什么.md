Xinhua News Agency, August 11th:

　　On the issue of the Korean military demarcation line, a topic in the current Korean armistice negotiations, the U.S. authorities have demonstrated an extremely abnormal and extremely contradictory attitude. Up to now, in order to expand its aggression, the U.S. representative has disregarded the common aspirations of people all over the world and the repeated declarations of the U.S. authorities against using the 38th parallel as the demarcation line between the two sides.

　　When the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, put forward a proposal for a Korean armistice on June 23, he clearly pointed out that the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue was that the belligerent parties should negotiate a ceasefire and armistice, and that both sides should withdraw their troops from the 38th parallel. Regarding Malik's proposal, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, when answering questions from members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on June 26, expressed his agreement. He said: "From a military point of view, a ceasefire at the 38th parallel is acceptable."

　　However, although the U.S. Secretary of State made the above formal statement in the U.S. Congress, the U.S. government has adopted a completely opposite attitude in the Korean armistice negotiations. Since General Nam Il proposed in the July 10 meeting that "the 38th parallel be determined as the military demarcation line, and the armed forces of both sides should simultaneously withdraw ten kilometers from the 38th parallel," the U.S. representative has unreasonably rejected it. In order to defend the U.S. negotiating representative's attitude, Acheson did not hesitate to go back on his word, contradicting himself at a press conference on July 13, saying: The 38th parallel he mentioned on June 26 "does not refer to a surveyor's line, but to the area where the United Nations forces are located."

　　Since then, the U.S. officialdom and the press have simultaneously launched a frantic propaganda campaign against a ceasefire at the 38th parallel. On July 24, U.S. Secretary of Defense Marshall issued a statement at a press conference, demanding the demarcation of a "defensible" military demarcation line. On August 1, Acheson again declared at a press conference: "The United States cannot accept the communist proposal to establish a demilitarized zone along the 38th parallel in Korea." He repeated Marshall's words, saying: "The demarcation line must be a militarily defensible demarcation line." However, Marshall and Acheson were unable to explain why the southern edge of the demilitarized zone based on the 38th parallel could not be "defended."

　　The arrogant attitude of the U.S. government went a step further on July 27. On this day, U.S. representative Joy was ordered to propose at the Kaesong armistice negotiation meeting a new military demarcation line 18 to 50 kilometers north of the existing battle line, that is, a line starting from Seoari (10 kilometers north of Goseong) on the east coast of Korea, westward through Changdo-ri, Dosu-dae, Jotan-ri, Daegyeong-ri, and Gyohyang-dong, and then southward into the west coast of Korea. According to the U.S. plan, the U.S. aggressor forces could easily expand the area of aggression by more than 7,400 square kilometers. The Information and Education Bureau of Ridgway Headquarters issued a communique on July 31, revealing the plan proposed by Joy, and described the 38th parallel, which Acheson had declared five weeks earlier as "acceptable from a military point of view" as the demarcation line, as "absurd" and "as irrelevant as the equator." But even Ridgway himself felt that this plan was truly "absurd," so on August 4, he ordered his spokesman, Nacos, to state: "It would be completely wrong to guess that the United Nations is asking to establish any demarcation line deep into North Korea," "This is a serious mistake, the most absurd conjecture." On August 6, Ridgway Headquarters issued a new communique, the content of which was the same as Nacos' statement, and contrary to the aforementioned communique of the headquarters on July 31.

　　But in any case, even after the resumption of the Kaesong negotiation meeting on August 10, Joy still insisted on drawing the military demarcation line north of the 38th parallel, deep into our position. The U.S. authorities, which aim to expand aggression, have such a contradictory and chaotic attitude towards the issue of the military demarcation line that Joy dares not publicly announce what the plan proposed by the U.S. in the repeated negotiations actually is.

### 美方对分界线问题矛盾百出混乱不堪  乔埃至今不敢公开发表美方方案究竟是什么

　　美方对分界线问题矛盾百出混乱不堪
    乔埃至今不敢公开发表美方方案究竟是什么
    【新华社十一日讯】在目前朝鲜停战谈判议题—朝鲜军事分界线问题上，美国当局表现了极端反常、极端矛盾的态度。迄今为止，美国代表为了要扩大侵略，一直不顾全世界人民的共同愿望和美国当局的多次宣言反对以北纬三十八度线为双方分界线。
    苏联驻联合国代表马立克六月二十三日提出朝鲜停战建议时，曾明确地指出：要和平解决朝鲜问题的第一个步骤是交战双方应该谈判停火与休战，双方应该把军队撤离三八线。对于马立克的这个建议，美国国务卿艾奇逊于六月二十六日在美国众议院外交委员会上答复议员们的询问时表示同意。他说：“从军事观点来看，在三八线停火是可以接受的。”
    但是，虽然这位美国国务卿在美国国会内发表了上面那种正式的谈话，美国政府在朝鲜停战谈判中所采取的却是完全相反的态度。自从南日将军在七月十日的会议中提出“确定三八线为军事分界线，双方武装部队应同时撤离三八线十公里”的建议以来，美方代表就一直无理地予以拒绝。而为了要替美方谈判代表这种态度辩解，艾奇逊竟不惜出尔反尔，自食前言，于七月十三日在记者招待会上自己打自己的嘴巴，他说：他在六月二十六日所说的三八线“不是指测量员的线，而是指联合国部队所在的一带地区。”
    从此以后，美国官方与报界就同时发动了疯狂的反对在三八线停战的宣传运动。七月二十四日，美国国防部长马歇尔在记者招待会上发表声明，要求划定一条“能够防守的”军事分界线。八月一日，艾奇逊又再次在记者招待会上宣告：“美国不能接受共产党所提朝鲜非军事区沿三八线建立的建议。”他重复马歇尔的话说：“分界线必须是一条军事上能够守御的分界线。”但是，马歇尔和艾奇逊都不能够解释，为什么以三八线为基础的非军事区域的南缘不能够“防守”。
    美国政府的狂妄态度到七月二十七日又进了一步。在这一天，美国代表乔埃奉命在开城停战谈判会议上提出在现有战线以北十八至五十公里地方设一道新的军事分界线，即从朝鲜东海岸西峨里（高城北十公里）起往西经昌道里、道修垈，猪滩里、大庆里、桥项洞再向南折入朝鲜西海岸的一条线。按照美国的方案，美国侵略军可以垂手而扩大侵略区域七千四百余平方公里。李奇微总部新闻教育局在七月三十一日发表公报，透露了乔埃所提出的方案，并且把艾奇逊在五个星期前还声明为“从军事观点看来可以接受”为分界线的三八线，说是“荒谬”的、“像赤道一样不相干”的东西。但是甚至李奇微自己也觉得这个方案真正“荒谬”，因此到八月四日，又命令他的发言人纳科斯声明：“猜测联合国要求建立任何深入北朝鲜的分界线将是完全错误的”，“这是严重的错误，是最荒唐的猜想。”八月六日，李奇微总部发表新的公报，其内容与纳科斯的声明相同，而与七月三十一日该总部的前述公报相反。
    但是无论如何，直至开城谈判会议在八月十日复开以后，乔埃仍然坚持将军事分界线划在三八线以北，深入我方阵地之内。旨在扩大侵略的美国当局对于军事分界线问题的态度如此矛盾混乱不堪，以至乔埃不敢公开发表美国在迭次谈判中所提出的方案究竟是什么。
