　　More Than 30,000 People Strenuously Repair
    Changchun-Shenyang Section of the China Chang Railway Resumes Passenger and Freight Transport
    The 180-li section of the China Chang Railway between Tieling and Shuangmiaozi, on the Changchun-Shenyang section, suffered from flooding on the 14th of this month. More than 50 sections of the line were destroyed, including a four-kilometer section of roadbed between Kaiyuan and Jingouzi stations that was completely washed away. Upon hearing the news, the China Chang Railway Bureau immediately formed a repair team of more than 9,000 employees to rush to the scene for repairs. Later, more than 22,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers and civilian workers went to reinforce the effort. The entire repair project was completed at 6:00 PM on the 27th. After testing the lines and bridges and carrying out repairs and reinforcements, the first passenger and freight train departed from Shenyang for Changchun at 9:00 AM on the 28th.
