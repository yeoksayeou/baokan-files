Both the Northwest Administrative Region and Liaodong Province have a Xi'an City; Letters should be clearly addressed to avoid errors.

There are two Xi'an Cities in the country: Xi'an City in the Northwest and Xi'an City in Liaodong Province. Many people, when writing to the above two places, do not specify the name of their respective major administrative region or province, which often leads to postal errors, and even causes many unnecessary troubles and losses.

According to the statistics of the receiving and dispatching office of the People's Government of Xi'an City, Liaodong Province, the average number of official documents and letters sent from various places to the People's Government of Xi'an City, Northwest, that are mistakenly sent to us every month is more than ten. Although these letters have been returned to the post office for re-delivery, the delivery time has been delayed, affecting their timely processing, and may even cause unnecessary losses due to the delay of urgent issues.

In addition, recently there were also two revolutionary servicemen's families from Changchun and Liaoyang who came to our city to visit their children, but could not find them. After investigation, it turned out that their children were in Xi'an City, Northwest, which was all caused by only writing the city name in the correspondence.

Therefore, I hope you will remind everyone to pay attention: when writing to Xi'an City in the Northwest or Xi'an City in Liaodong Province, you must specify the name of the major administrative region or province to which it belongs.

### 西北行政区和辽东省都有西安市写信时应分别清楚以免发生错误

　　西北行政区和辽东省都有西安市写信时应分别清楚以免发生错误
    全国有两个西安市：西北西安市和辽东省西安市。很多人在向上述两地写信时不写明其所属大行政区名或省名，以致常常发生邮递错误的事情，甚至造成很多不必要的麻烦和损失。
    据我们辽东省西安市人民政府收发室统计，每月各地寄给西北西安市人民政府的公文信件误寄我处者平均总在十件以上。这些信虽已退给邮局另行投递，但已延误了送达时间，影响其及时处理，甚至可能使紧急问题受到耽搁而造成不必要的损失。
    此外，最近还有从长春、辽阳两地来的两位革命军人家属，到我市探望子弟，结果却找不到。经了解，原来他们的子弟是在西北西安市，这都是来往信件只写市名所致。
    因此，我希望你们提起大家注意：在写信到西北西安市或辽东省西安市时，必须写明所属大行政区名或省名。
