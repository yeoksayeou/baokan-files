　　The "Wu Xun History Investigation Team" Completes an Arduous Task
To the Editor:
    The "Report on the Investigation of the History of Wu Xun," recently serialized in the People's Daily, has helped me to correctly understand Wu Xun. My initial understanding of Wu Xun himself was that he originally had good intentions, but unfortunately, he was exploited by the ruling class. Later, I thought it was possible that he originally had good intentions, but after contacting the ruling class, he betrayed his original intentions and consciously and willingly became a lackey of the ruling class. Therefore, I couldn't understand Comrade Fan Wenlan's use of the term "big rogue" in his article. However, after reading the "Report on the Investigation of the History of Wu Xun" and seeing his rogue and barbaric "begging" behavior, I realized that Comrade Fan Wenlan's evaluation of Wu Xun was correct. In this way, I have a further understanding of the ideological essence of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and its directors. Here, I propose to reward the comrades who directly completed this valuable work—the Wu Xun History Investigation Team—because they have indeed mastered the scientific method of Marxism-Leninism and completed this meaningful work.

　　“武训历史调查团”完成了一项艰巨的任务编辑同志：
    最近人民日报连载的《武训历史调查记》，帮助我正确地认识了武训。对武训本人的认识，我最初以为他原是好意，可惜被统治阶级利用啦。后来，又认为可能他原先是好意，但后来接触了统治阶级之后才背叛了原意，自觉自愿的成了统治阶级的狗腿子，所以我当时对范文澜同志文内所说“大流氓”一语很想不通。可是看了《武训历史调查记》以后，看到他那无赖蛮横的“乞讨”行为，才认识到范文澜同志对武训的评语是正确的。这样，我对影片《武训传》及其编导者的思想本质也有了进一步的认识。在这里，我提议给直接完成此项有价值的工作的同志们——武训历史调查团以奖励，因为他们确实掌握了马列主义的科学方法，完成了这项有意义的工作。
