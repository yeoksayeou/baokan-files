Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: TASS, New York, August 25th: The leader of the "American Peace Crusade" issued a statement on the Korean armistice negotiations, saying: "The war must stop, without any delay, so that the negotiations can achieve the goal desired by people all over the world: to achieve peace in Korea."
    The "American Peace Crusade" has announced the launch of a special "Ceasefire Immediately" movement. Many delegations, representing trade unions, women's groups, youth groups, black people, civic groups, and various friendship associations and other organizations, will visit members of Congress to "urge them to speak out righteously so that the ceasefire negotiations can be successfully concluded."
    Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: TASS, New York, August 25th: Progressive Party Chairman Binson and Secretary Baldwin announced that they have written to Truman regarding the current crisis in the Korean armistice negotiations. They demanded that Truman immediately stop the Korean War. They said: "If the killing stops, accidents will not happen. The American people do not care where the demarcation line is drawn. They want peace. They want their sons to come home. Please order a halt to bombing and shelling today. The responsibility is on you, Mr. President, the people elected you to represent them, not to represent the generals."
    Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: TASS, London, August 26th: The Executive Committee of the London Peace Council held a meeting on August 24th, at which a telegram to Attlee was unanimously adopted. The content is as follows:
    "The London Peace Council urges the British government, as a member of the United Nations involved in the Korean dispute, to ensure that ceasefire negotiations continue and to seek ways to stop hostilities."
    Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: TASS, London, August 25th: The British "Worker's Daily" published a statement by Mrs. Felton regarding the American attempt to kill personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, causing the Kaesong ceasefire negotiations to be suspended.
    Mrs. Felton said: As early as July, the Americans' actions in the armistice negotiations showed that the reason the United States accepted Malik's peace proposal was merely to use some means to restore its prestige, and it was by no means trying to achieve peace. The American aircraft bombing of Kaesong is already conclusive and undeniable. This is another attempt by the Americans to continue the war.

    表达美英人民要求和平愿望
    费尔顿夫人痛斥美国飞机轰炸开城
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社纽约二十五日讯：“美国和平十字军”领袖就朝鲜停火谈判发表声明说：“战争必须停止，不能有任何拖延，这样，谈判才能达到全世界人所希望的目的，就是：在朝鲜实现和平。”
    “美国和平十字军”已宣布发起特别的“立刻停战”运动。许多代表团代表着工会的、妇女的、青年的、黑人的、市民的团体以及各种联谊团体和其他的组织，将访问国会议员，“促使他们仗义执言，使停战谈判得以圆满结束”。
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社纽约二十五日讯：进步党主席宾逊与书记鲍尔温宣布，他们已就朝鲜停火谈判中目前的危机写信给杜鲁门。他们要求杜鲁门立即停止朝鲜战争。他们说：“如果杀人的勾当停止，就不会发生事故。美国人民不管分界线划在什么地方。他们要和平。他们要他们的儿子回家来。请你今天就下令停止轰炸与炮击。责任是在你身上，总统先生，人民选举你是要你来代表他们，而不是要你代表将军们。”
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十六日讯：伦敦和平委员会执行委员会八月二十四日举行了会议，会上一致通过了给艾德礼的电报，内容如下：
    “伦敦和平委员会敦促身为参与朝鲜争端的联合国会员国的英国政府，保证停火谈判继续举行并寻求得停止敌对行动的方法。”
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十五日讯：英国“工人日报”刊载费尔顿夫人就美国企图杀害朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团人员而使开城停火谈判停顿一事所发表的声明。
    费尔顿夫人说：早在七月里，美国人在停战谈判中的行为就表明了美国之所以接受马立克的和平建议，只不过是想要点手段以挽回它的威信，决不是想要达成和平。美国飞机轰炸开城，已经是证据确凿，无可争辩的了。这是美国人想继续战争的另一次尝试。
