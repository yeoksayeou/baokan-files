Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 17th: The New York "Daily Worker" of August 13th reported that long before Soviet Representative to the United Nations Malik put forward his proposal to promote the current negotiations, there was already widespread public support in the United States for a ceasefire at the 38th parallel in Korea.

Senator Johnson of Colorado’s bill, proposed on May 17th, received broad support. This bill advocated: a ceasefire at the 38th parallel from the anniversary of the Korean War, June 25th; the complete withdrawal of foreign troops before December 1st.

Among those supporting a ceasefire at the 38th parallel were American Labor Party Chairman Marcantonio, Washington State Representative Tollefson, Washington State Senator Magnuson, hundreds of leaders from the CIO, AFL, and independent unions, such as Stredlo, leader of United Auto Workers Local 600—Ford Factory Branch, Frazier of the American Independent Public Works Workers Union, and Wiggin of the AFL Seattle Shipbuilding, Caulking, and Seamanship Workers Union, as well as hundreds of leaders from all walks of life.

Among those who recently expressed support for this proposal is Senator Langer of North Dakota, who in a letter to a New York voter on August 10th, who had spoken to him about Johnson’s proposal, stated that he also supported the proposal.

The New York "Daily Worker" also reported many messages from the American people demanding an immediate cessation of hostilities in Korea and the success of the negotiations. Bryson, President of the National Union of Marine Cooks and Stewards, has written to President Truman, demanding a cessation of hostilities during the armistice negotiations. He also asked Truman to order the American representatives in Kaesong to negotiate in good faith so that both sides could reach an agreement on the various issues in dispute.

In a letter to the National Labor Conference for Peace, Bryson said that he had telegraphed the heads of the Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and San Pedro branches of the National Union of Marine Cooks and Stewards, asking them to solicit the signatures of all members of the branch executive committees on telegrams with similar content to President Truman.

　　美国人民支持在三八线停战
    要美国代表诚心谈判
    主张立即停止朝鲜军事行动
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】八月十三日的纽约《工人日报》报道，在苏联驻联合国代表马立克提出他的促成目前谈判的建议以前，美国很早就有广大的公众支持在朝鲜三八线上休战的意见了。
    科罗拉多州参议员约翰逊在五月十七日提出的议案曾得到广泛的支持，这个议案主张：自朝鲜战争周年纪念日、六月二十五日起，在三八线上休战；外国军队在十二月一日以前全部撤退。
    在支持在三八线休战的人们中有美国劳工党主席马肯托尼奥，有华盛顿州众议员托勒佛逊、华盛顿州参议员麦格纳逊；数百名产联、劳联、和独立工会的领袖们，如联合汽车工人工会第六百分会——福特工厂分会的领袖斯特拉多，美国独立公共工程工人联合会的弗雷则尔，劳联西雅图造船、接合、填塞船缝工会的威金等，此外还有各界领袖数百人。
    新近表示支持这个建议的人中间有北达科他州的参议员郎基，他在八月十日复信给和他谈到约翰逊建议的纽约州选民时表示他也支持这个建议。
    纽约《工人日报》还报道了许多美国人民要求立即停止朝鲜境内的敌对行动并使谈判成功的消息。海船厨师侍者工会主席勃里逊已经写信给杜鲁门总统，要求在停战谈判期间停止敌对行动。他还要求杜鲁门命令开城的美国代表诚心谈判，以便双方能在所争执的各种问题上达成协议。
    勃里逊在致全国劳工和平会议的信中说道，他已经致电海船厨师侍者工会西雅图、波特兰、旧金山，和圣比德罗各地分会的负责人，要求他们征求分会执行委员会的全体委员在致杜鲁门总统的内容相似的电报上签名。
