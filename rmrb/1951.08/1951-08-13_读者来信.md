    Some Areas in Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, Do Not Value the Supervision of Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    The Leading Organs of the County Are Now Inspecting and Correcting

    After the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries in Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, the political awareness of the broad masses of people has greatly improved, and the political situation in rural areas has undergone significant changes. However, in some areas, there are still many ideological obstacles in the implementation of the policy of supervising counter-revolutionary elements. Some cadres and the masses regard the work of supervising counter-revolutionary elements as troublesome. They believe: "Sending them to the government is useless, and letting the people supervise them is even more useless." For example, the county people's court sentenced Chen Junming, a counter-revolutionary element in Chenjiahe Village, Seventh District, to return to the village for supervision. The masses said: "Keep him in the county for a few more days! We are busy; asking us to supervise him is just adding to our burden!" Some cadres and the masses believe that if they seriously supervise counter-revolutionary elements, it will be difficult to get along with them after the counter-revolutionary elements are released from supervision, so they relax the supervision. Some even give important work to the supervised counter-revolutionary elements. For example, Wenjiazhuang Village assigned Cui Shiye, a counter-revolutionary element under supervision, to propaganda tasks, saying: "He knows how to do propaganda, so let him do propaganda." Gouxi and other villages mistakenly allowed supervised counter-revolutionary elements to participate in people's gatherings.

    Shouyang County has also not done enough in educating the families of counter-revolutionary elements. As a result, the families of counter-revolutionary elements in some places are emotionally disturbed and do not engage in production; some even sell their property and indulge in extravagant eating and drinking. For example, in the Seventh District, fourteen counter-revolutionary elements were suppressed one after another, and the performance of the fourteen families was very poor.

    After discovering the above problems, the CCP Shouyang County Committee of Shanxi Province has instructed each district to convene meetings of the families of counter-revolutionary elements, explain the policies to them, educate them to draw a clear line with the counter-revolutionary elements, and also suggested that the county people's government quickly deal with the property issues of counter-revolutionary elements to stabilize the emotions of the families of counter-revolutionary elements and enable them to concentrate on production. In terms of supervision work, the CCP Shouyang County Committee of Shanxi Province has instructed each district to inspect and correct various deviations, and continue to carry out education to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves among the masses, and create supervision experience. In order to dispel the concerns of the masses in some villages about supervision work and promote the supervised counter-revolutionary elements to consciously obey supervision, our county plans to let the supervised counter-revolutionary elements formulate their own supervision regulations, which will then be supervised and implemented by the village government and the masses. This is currently being planned.

    Editor's Note: The CCP Shouyang County Committee corrected some deviations in the county's work of supervising counter-revolutionary elements, which is very good. However, the county's plan to let supervised counter-revolutionary elements formulate their own supervision regulations is very inappropriate. The regulations for the supervision of counter-revolutionaries should be stipulated by the people's government and should never be stipulated by the counter-revolutionary elements themselves. We hope that the county will correct this practice.

    Severely Ban the Activities of "Black Lawyers"
    Xiong Gongwu Solicited Lawsuits, Provoked Disputes
    Changsha People's Court Sentenced Him to Eight Years Imprisonment

Editor:

    A small number of illegal elements in Changsha City are engaging in "black lawyer" activities. They solicit lawsuits, provoke disputes, defraud property, seriously disrupt social order, and damage the government's prestige. According to the instructions of the Ministry of Justice of the Central People's Government, the Changsha People's Court has severely banned this illegal behavior; those whose circumstances are serious will be punished according to law. Recently, the Changsha People's Court sentenced "black lawyer" Xiong Gongwu to eight years in prison.

    Xiong Gongwu engaged in "black lawyer" activities under the guise of setting up a stall. He often wrote indictments, defenses, "confessions," "repentance" letters, and appeals to various agencies and organizations for others. According to investigations, there are more than 70 cases, each defrauding two to three hundred thousand yuan. In order to achieve the purpose of defrauding money, he did not hesitate to provoke disputes, distort facts, and increase the complexity of the disputes. For example, in the case of Tan Shaoxian and Zhao Jianxun involving compensation for damages, from the mediation by the district office to the final judgment of the Central South Branch of the Supreme People's Court, the pleadings submitted by the plaintiff Tan Shaoxian were all handled by Xiong. In May of this year, the case was forwarded by the Central South Branch of the Supreme People's Court to the Changsha People's Court for execution (ordering Zhao Jianxun to compensate Tan Shaoxian 130,000 yuan); Xiong again wrote a report on behalf of the defendant Zhao Jianxun on June 14, falsely claiming that the judgment was inconsistent with the facts and resolutely unacceptable, requesting the Changsha People's Court to retry the case. Because of his instigation and provocation, obscuring the truth, this 130,000 yuan house sale dispute has been delayed for eleven months and cannot be finally resolved, seriously hindering the progress of the people's judicial work and harming the interests of the people. Before liberation, Xiong engaged in reactionary legal affairs and served as an officer in the Horse Administration Department and Military Affairs Department of the Kuomintang army, actively engaging in reactionary work for 22 years. After liberation, he still did not repent and engaged in soliciting lawsuits and defrauding property. The Changsha People's Court has sentenced him to eight years in prison and forced labor reform.

    In order to completely eliminate the illegal activities of "black lawyers," in addition to continuing to mobilize the masses to expose and report, the Changsha People's Court has also vigorously strengthened the work of answering questions and writing documents on behalf of the people, added specialists to regularly answer citizens' questions about laws and regulations, write lawsuits for free, and be responsible for mediating general minor disputes.

    山西省寿阳县部分地区不重视管制反革命分子
    该县领导机关现在检查纠正
    山西省寿阳县经过镇压反革命运动，广大人民群众政治觉悟大大提高，农村政治情况有了显著改变。但是，部分地区在执行管制反革命分子政策上还有不少思想障碍。有些干部、群众把管制反革命分子的工作看作是麻烦事儿。他们认为：“送到政府还不顶事，让人民管制更没有用。”如七区陈家河村反革命分子陈俊明由县人民法院判处回村管制。群众说：“在县里多押几天吧！正忙的时候，要我们管制他，不是让我们增加负担吗！”有些干部、群众认为认真管制了反革命分子，在反革命分子被解除管制后，不好相处，因而放松了管制。有的甚至给被管制的反革命分子重要工作，如温家庄村就给受管制的反革命分子崔士业布置宣传任务，并说：“人家会宣传，就叫他宣传吧。”沟西等村则错误地让受管制的反革命分子参加人民集会。
    寿阳县对反革命分子家属的教育工作也做得不够。因而有些地方的反革命分子家属情绪不安，不事生产；有的甚至变卖财产，大吃大喝。如七区全区前后镇压了十四个反革命分子，该十四户家属的表现都很不好。
    中共山西省寿阳县委员会发现上述问题后，已指示各区召集反革命分子家属开会，向他们讲清政策，教育他们和反革命分子划清界线，此外并建议县人民政府迅速处理反革命分子的财产问题，以安定反革命分子家属的情绪，使他们安心生产。在管制工作方面，中共山西省寿阳县委员会已指示各区检查、纠正各种偏向，并在群众中继续进行分清敌我界线的教育，创造管制经验。为了解除某些村子群众对管制工作的顾虑，并促进被管制的反革命分子自觉服从管制，我县拟让被管制的反革命分子自己订出管制条例，然后由村政府和群众监督执行。现正在计划进行。
                中共山西省寿阳县委员会  孙鐩  树纲
    编者按：中共寿阳县委员会检查纠正了该县管制反革命分子工作中的一些偏向，这是很好的。但是，该县准备让受管制的反革命分子自己订立管制条例的做法，是很不妥当的。对反革命的管制条例应该由人民政府规定，决不应该由反革命分子自己规定。希望该县纠正这种做法。
    严厉取缔“黑律师”活动
    熊宫午包揽诉讼、挑拨是非
    长沙人民法院判他徒刑八年编辑同志：
    长沙市有少数不法分子进行“黑律师”活动。他们包揽诉讼，挑拨是非，诈取财物，严重地破坏社会秩序，损害政府威信。长沙市人民法院根据中央人民政府司法部指示，严厉取缔这种违法行为；其情节重大者，则依法予以惩办。最近长沙市人民法院即判处“黑律师”熊宫午徒刑八年。
    熊宫午以摆课摊为名，进行“黑律师”活动。他经常替人代撰起诉书、辩诉书、“坦白”书、“悔过”书及向各机关团体呼吁书等，经查有据者，就有七十多件，每件诈取两三万元不等。为了达到诈财目的，他不惜挑拨是非，歪曲事实，增加纠纷的复杂性。如谭绍先与赵建勋因损害赔偿一案，由区公所调解一直到最高人民法院中南分院终审判决，原告谭绍先所呈书状，都是由熊犯一手包办的。本年五月，该案由最高人民法院中南分院转发长沙市人民法院执行（判由赵建勋赔偿谭绍先人民币十三万元）；熊犯又于六月十四日代被告赵建勋撰写报告，诡称判决与事实不符，坚决不能接受，请求长沙市人民法院重判。因他这样左右怂恿挑拨，蒙蔽真情，致使这件十三万元的房屋买卖纠纷案，拖延了十一个月还不能作最后解决，严重阻碍了人民司法工作的推进，损害了人民的利益。熊犯在解放前曾进行反动律师事务，并在匪军政部马政司及军务处充任过军官，积极从事反动工作达二十二年之久。解放后仍不思改悔，以包揽诉讼、诈取财物为业。长沙市人民法院已判处其徒刑八年，并强制劳动改造。
    为了彻底肃清“黑律师”的非法活动，长沙市人民法院除继续发动群众揭发检举外，并大力加强问事代书工作，增设专人经常替市民解答法令疑难问题，免费代写诉状，并负责调解一般轻微纠纷。
