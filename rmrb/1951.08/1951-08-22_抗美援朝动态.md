Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Dynamics

　　National Donations for Aircraft Exceed 2,300
    As of August 20th, weapon donation statistics from across the country are as follows:

Region  East China   Central South  Northeast   North China  Southwest   Northwest  Inner Mongolia  Individual Units  Total
Aircraft 838   605   275   263   190   108   14   30   2323
Artillery 34   10   7   49   16   9   3   128
Anti-aircraft guns 15   7   6   4   1   1   50
Tanks 3   1   1   1   5

    Note: The figures listed above for Central South, North China, and Southwest are based on the most recent reports to this association from the regional general branches. The figures for other regions are compiled based on newspaper materials from various locations. Some regions have slightly altered the types of weapons donated compared to the statistics published in Issue 28 of this publication; some aircraft donated by "individual units" have been included in regional calculations, hence the change in numbers.

  Northwest Region's Patriotic Movement in August
    Shaanxi, Ningxia, and other provinces are currently conducting comprehensive inspections of patriotic compacts and preferential treatment work. In Gansu Province, the donation campaign is continuing in one-third of the areas, while two-thirds of the areas are further integrating it with production, striving to complete the donation plan as early as possible. In Qinghai Province, most counties convened Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea representative conferences in July. Representatives of the delegation to Korea will conduct reporting in various counties of the province in late August. The patriotic movement in Xinjiang Province continues to deepen. The delegation to Korea is conducting reporting throughout the province. Ürümqi has begun a widespread inspection of the establishment and implementation of patriotic compacts. The movement to donate weapons is underway. People from all walks of life in Xi'an have begun paying donations and continue to carry out the work of inspecting, supplementing, and revising patriotic compacts.

  Current Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement in the Central South Region
    The Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement in the Central South Region has now achieved new successes. The donation movement in the region has spread to the vast majority of cities and rural areas, and the people have successively established specific plans for increasing production and making donations. The entire region has pledged to donate 605 aircraft, 10 artillery pieces, and 7 anti-aircraft guns. Payments have reached 70.1 billion yuan. Many factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, streets, and rural areas have established or revised patriotic compacts. Many places have even extended them to the most basic production, work, and study units, and to individual families, thereby promoting production, work, and study, and ensuring the timely completion of donation plans. The preferential treatment work in the region underwent a comprehensive inspection and deployment around the "August 1st" Army Day. The Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement in the entire region has made rapid and significant progress since June, and is more in-depth and widespread than before "May 1st" Labor Day.

    However, the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea movement in the Central South Region still has some shortcomings, mainly: on the one hand, the leadership in some places failed to guide the patriotic enthusiasm of the people in a timely and correct manner, resulting in the disconnection between the donation movement and increasing production and improving operations. On the other hand, some cadres in charge of leadership work in some places have taken coercive methods, forcing the masses to donate or establish patriotic compacts, thereby causing public dissatisfaction. These shortcomings are being corrected.

　　抗美援朝动态
    全国人民认捐飞机已超过二千三百架
    截至八月二十日止，全国各地认捐武器数字统计如下：地区  华东
    中南   东北    华北   西南   西北  内蒙  个别单位 总计飞机
  八三八  六○五 二七五  二六三 一九○ 一○八  一四  三○   二三二三架大炮  三四  一○  七     四九  一六 九  三            一二八门高射炮一五  七    六     四    一一 七      五○门坦克  三       一         一      五辆
    附注：上表所列中南、华北、西南数字，系最近各该区总分会向本会报告的。其他地区的数字系根据各地报纸材料统计的。有的地区认捐武器种类较本刊第二十八期发表的统计略有变动；“个别单位”发起捐献的飞机有的已列入地区计算，故数字亦有变动。
  西北区八月份开展爱国运动的情况
    陕西、宁夏等省目前正在普遍进行检查爱国公约和优抚工作。甘肃省的捐献运动在三分之一的地区正继续开展，三分之二的地区正进一步与生产结合，争取及早完成捐献计划。青海省在七月份内，大多数的县都召开了抗美援朝代表会议。赴朝慰问团代表在八月下旬将分别到该省各县进行传达报告。新疆省的爱国运动在继续深入。赴朝慰问团正在该省各地进行传达报告。迪化市已开始普遍检查爱国公约的订立和执行情况。捐献武器的运动正在开展。西安市各阶层人民开始缴纳捐款，并继续开展检查、补订和修订爱国公约的工作。
  中南区当前的抗美援朝运动
    中南区的抗美援朝运动现已取得新的成绩。该区的捐献运动已遍及全区的绝大部分城市和农村，人民群众已经纷纷订立具体的增产捐献计划。全区已认捐飞机六百零五架，大炮十门，高射炮七门。缴款已达七百零一亿元。许多工厂、企业、机关、学校、街道和农村都订了或重新修订爱国公约。不少地方并一直订到最基层的生产、工作、学习单位和各个家庭，从而推动了生产、工作和学习，保证捐献计划的如期实现。该区的优抚工作在“八一”前后，做了一次普遍的检查和布置。全区的抗美援朝运动从六月以后，进展是很快很大的，比起“五一”前，是更深入，更普及了。
    但是，中南区的抗美援朝运动还存在着一些缺点，主要是：一方面，有些地方的领导方面未能及时地、正确地引导人民群众的爱国热情，致使捐献运动与增加生产、改善经营脱了节。另一方面，有的地方有些负责领导工作的干部，竟采取强迫命令的方法，强制群众捐献或订立爱国公约，因而引起群众不满。这些缺点正在纠正中。
