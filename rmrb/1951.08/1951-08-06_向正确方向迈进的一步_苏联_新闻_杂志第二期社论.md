　　A Step in the Right Direction
    Soviet "News" Magazine, Second Issue Editorial
    The issue of raising the living standards of the people is one that cannot be ignored. In the mid-twentieth century, when technology has made great strides and it seems that there is little that science cannot solve, the fact that a large part of humanity still lives in inhuman conditions is something that human reason cannot help but resent.
    It is truly shameful that some countries, with excellent climates and fertile soil, capable of several harvests a year, are frequently plagued by famine, and millions die for lack of the bare necessities of life.
    It is a stain on humanity that the working people who create the world's wealth live in poverty, are unable to send their children to school, and are deprived of the most basic enjoyments and pleasures.
    In Western Europe, in Britain, the United States, and most other countries, the continuous rise in prices and the deterioration of living conditions are becoming increasingly acute problems. This is creating tension and causing widespread dissatisfaction.
    It is not only trade unions that see this as a top priority. Many scientists are heartbroken that the achievements of science are not being used to combat hunger and poverty. Sober-minded people resolutely oppose the idea of "overpopulation" and the need to forcibly reduce fertility. This is pure defeatism. The earth is rich, nature is generous, and the world could easily feed several times its current population.
    There is no doubt that the injustices and imbalances in the economic structure of many countries can be eliminated by reasonable means, even if only partially, and that ways can be found to improve the living conditions of the masses.
    The time is ripe to solve this problem. Many people are fighting for this. For example, the annual meeting of the Council of the British Association of Scientific Workers in London in late May instructed the Executive Committee of the Association to convene, together with other scientific organizations, a meeting of leading scientists from the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and China to discuss measures to address urgent issues such as food production and distribution, the efficient use of scarce fuels and raw materials, the industrial application of atomic energy, and the exchange of medical knowledge.
    Many trade union organizations have also made similar proposals, as trade unions are naturally particularly concerned about the current situation.
    The meeting of the World Peace Council held in Berlin from February 21st to 26th decided to convene an International Economic Conference in 1951, welcoming economists, engineers, industrialists, businessmen, and trade unionists from all countries to participate. The World Peace Council suggested that the conference should discuss the following issues: (1) How to improve living standards peacefully in the mid-twentieth century, and (2) How to improve economic relations between countries.
    It is very clear that these two issues are closely related. Both require the maintenance of peace. During wartime and the postwar period, economic and trade relations between countries have become irregular. And since the Second World War, these relations have been further undermined by the unilateral actions of those who seek to plan a third world war.
    Many countries have converted their economies to a wartime footing. This action hinders economic relations between countries and the exchange of raw materials and finished products, obstructs technological progress, hinders international economic cooperation, drives up prices, and has a negative impact on living standards. The ultimate result is to deepen international tensions and create conflict.
    It is not only the working people who are suffering. The interests of many industrialists and businessmen are also being harmed. In Western Europe, Britain, and even the United States, the pursuit of unnatural economic policies that block trade between countries has caused great difficulties for thousands of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, and they are facing bankruptcy. In Britain, representatives at almost every trade union meeting have stated that expanding trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies would help reduce prices in Britain and other countries and help these countries overcome economic difficulties. British industrial and commercial enterprises have written to the Minister of Trade, Mr. Shawcross, protesting the economic blockade against China. Some major enterprises belonging to the Federation of British Industries have said that the embargo on China is disintegrating British trade in Asia and will cause huge losses to British industry.
    More examples can be given to show how people are reacting to trade discrimination against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.
    The disruption of normal trade relations undoubtedly has an adverse impact on the vital interests of all countries in the world.
    Normal international trade relations have been disrupted by the self-serving policies of a small group of monopoly capitalists who are only concerned with encouraging the rearmament movement and are eager to control the world's supply of raw materials. These monopoly capitalists have enough power in their own countries to direct governments to adopt any economic policies, no matter how detrimental they may be to the governments themselves. Therefore, progressives must take action if they hope that constructive proposals will prevail.
    The work of planning measures to restore economic relations and raise living standards can and should be carried out by the United Nations economic agencies. But the current situation proves the incompetence of the United Nations economic agencies.
    This is not the fault of the United Nations Charter, but because the United Nations is also under pressure from the same group of monopoly capitalists and is being used by them to promote their own political ends. However, it should be perfectly clear that if international economic relations are to be improved, political struggle and hatred must be abandoned.
    Holding an International Economic Conference is a new step in this direction. Such a conference is unprecedented and valuable. Scientists, engineers, industrialists, businessmen, economists, and trade union activists from different countries will gather together, not to engage in political debates, not to force each other to accept their particular views on social and political systems, but to discuss the economic development of their own countries and to plan practical measures. These well-intentioned people, armed with concrete plans, will be able to unite public opinion in various countries and put pressure on those who can remove the obstacles to establishing normal international economic relations and eliminate the direct causes of declining living standards.
    The best policy at present is not to seek radical solutions, nor to suggest major changes. Such issues should be decided by the countries themselves. The best policy now is to agree on reasonable measures that can be implemented under the existing system.
    We believe that it is correct and reasonable to hold the International Economic Conference in the Soviet Union. The economic policy of the Soviet Union is entirely aimed at improving the well-being of the people and making the forces of nature serve humanity. Many countries are still far from this point, and the practical experience of the Soviet Union can prove useful and illuminating in many ways in finding special measures to help develop productive forces.

　　向正确方向迈进的一步
    苏联“新闻”杂志第二期社论
    提高人民生活水准的问题，是一个不容忽视的问题。在二十世纪的中叶，当技术已经有了大踏步的发展，似乎很少什么事情是科学所不能解决的时候，很大一部分人类的生活境况仍然停留在非人的水平上，这是人类的理性所不能不感到愤慨的。
    一些国家有着优良的气候，有着富饶肥沃的土壤，一年能有几次收成，可是却频频受到饥馑的光顾，千千万万人因为没有最低限度的生活必需品而致死亡，这种情形的确是很可耻的。
    创造世界财富的劳动人民，却在贫困中过活，没有能力送他们的子女上学，并且被剥削了最基本的享受和乐趣，这是人类的污点。
    在西欧，在英国、美国和大多数其他国家，物价的不断上涨和生活境况的恶化变成愈来愈尖锐的问题。这就促成了局面的紧张，并引起广泛的不满。
    把这件事看作头号问题的，并不止于工会。许多科学家们对科学的成就没有被利用来与饥饿和贫乏作斗争，衷心感到悲痛。头脑清醒的人都断然反对所谓“世界人口过剩”因而必须强制降低生殖率的说法。这完全是一种失败主义。地球是富饶的，自然是慷慨的，世界上的人口即使比现在多好几倍，人类也还是能够丰衣足食。
    毫无疑问，目前许多国家经济结构的不公道和不平衡，是能够用合理的办法来加以消除的，即使只是部分地消除，同时人们也可以想出办法来改善群众的生活境况。
    解决这个问题的时机已经成熟了。许多人都在为这件事情奋斗。例如，五月下旬在伦敦举行的英国科学工作者协会理事会年会就指示协会的执行委员会，叫它与其他科学团体一道，共同召开英美苏法中五国首要的科学家的会议，以讨论用怎样的措施来解决这种急迫的问题，诸如粮食的生产和分配，稀有燃料与原料的有效使用，原子能的工业应用和医学知识的交流等。
    许多工会团体也提出了类似的建议，因为工会自然是特别关切目前这种情况的。
    二月二十一日到二十六日在柏林举行的世界和平理事会会议决定在一九五一年召开国际经济会议，欢迎一切国家的经济学家、工程师、实业家、商人和工会人士参加。世界和平理事会建议，会议应讨论如下的问题：（一）如何在二十世纪中叶在和平的情况下改善生活水准，（二）如何改善各国间的经济关系。
    这两个问题有密切的关系，这是非常明显的。两个问题都要求保持和平。在战时和战后时期，各国间的经济关系与贸易关系失去常规。而自从二次大战以后，由于一些力图策划第三次世界大战的人的片面行动，这种关系是更进一步地被破坏了。
    许多国家已经把它们的经济转入战时体制。这种行动妨害了各国间的经济关系和原料成品的交换，阻碍了技术进步，妨碍了国际经济合作，促使物价上涨，并且对生活水准发生恶劣的影响。最后的结果就是加深国际局势的紧张而产生冲突。
    遭受痛苦的不仅是劳动人民。许多工商业家的利益也受到损失。在西欧、英国，甚至在美国，由于奉行不合自然规律的经济政策，阻断了各国间的贸易交流，就使得成千的中小工商业家正遭遇着巨大的困难，并且面临破产。在英国，几乎每一次的工会会议上，都有代表表示：扩大对苏联和人民民主国家的贸易，有助于英国及其他国家物价的降低，并有助于这些国家的克服经济困难。英国工商业企业纷纷写信给贸易大臣萧克劳斯，抗议对中国实行经济封锁。英国工业界联合会所属的一些主要企业就曾说：对华禁运令使英国在亚洲的贸易解体，而且会造成英国工业的巨大损失。
    还能够举出更多的例子，表明人民对于对苏联和人民民主国家的贸易歧视的反应如何。
    正常贸易关系的被破坏，无疑对于世界各国的切身利益有着不利的影响。
    正常国际贸易关系已被一小群独占资本家的唯自己利益是图的政策破坏了，这一小群独占资本家们，只关心于鼓励重整军备运动，急切希望一手控制世界的原料供应。这些独占资本家们在本国有足够的权力，去指使政府采取任何无论怎样不利于政府本身的经济政策。因此，进步分子们如果希望建设性的建议能够得势，就必须行动起来。
    策划恢复经济关系并提高生活水平之措施的工作，能够而且应该由联合国经济机构去进行。可是现在的这种情况，证明了联合国经济机构的无能。
    这不能怪联合国宪章，而是由于联合国也在受着同一群独占资本家的压力，而被他们用来促进他们自己的政治目的。但是，应该完全清楚的是：如果要改善国际经济关系，必须抛弃政治斗争和仇恨。
    举行国际经济会议是向这个方向迈进的新的一步，这种会议是空前的，也是有价值的。不同国家的科学家、工程师、工业家、商业家、经济学家和工会运动分子将聚集到一起，不是要进行政治争论，不是要彼此强迫对方接受自己对于社会和政治制度所持的特别观点，而是要讨论他们自己国内的经济发展并策划实际的措施。这些用具体的计划把自己武装了起来的善意的人们，能够把各国的舆论团结起来，对那些能够清除建立正常国际经济关系途中的障碍并消灭造成生活水准下降的直接原因的人们施以压力。
    当前的上策不是寻求激烈的解决方法，也不是建议采取重大的变革。这种问题是应由各国自行决定的问题。现在的上策是协议一项可以在现存制度之下实行的合理措施。
    我们认为国际经济会议在苏联举行是正确而合理的。苏联这个国家的经济政策，完全是以增进人民幸福和使各种自然力量为人类服务为目的的。许多国家，距离这一点还很远，苏联的实际经验对于寻找有助于发展生产力的特别措施一事，可以在许多方面证明是有用的和具有启发性的。      （新华社）
