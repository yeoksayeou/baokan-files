Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 12th: According to TASS, over 50,000 female youth representatives from various countries participating in the World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace held a demonstration rally in support of female youth peace fighters on August 9th at the open-air square in Berlin's Friedrichshain district. The rally was presided over by Madame Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the Women's International Democratic Federation. At Madame Vaillant-Couturier's suggestion, the entire audience stood in silence to mourn the women who sacrificed themselves in the anti-fascist and anti-war struggles. Ms. Berlez, Secretary-General of the French Union of Young Women, read out the congratulatory message from Madame Gordon, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, amidst warm applause. Representatives from the Soviet Union, China, France, Italy, Germany, Iran, and other countries delivered speeches, reporting on the struggles of youth in their respective countries for peace. Li Shunren, a female Korean guerrilla fighter, represented the Korean female youth and congratulated the conference, receiving a warm welcome from the participants. A Vietnamese female youth representative stepped onto the podium and affectionately kissed Raymonda Dien, a French female youth in the presidium, expressing the unity and friendship between Vietnamese and French youth.

Madame Vaillant-Couturier then presented the Women's International Democratic Federation's honorary award – the gold Peace Dove Medal – to the following nine heroic female youth warriors who defended peace: Li Shunren, a female Korean guerrilla fighter who rescued 80 wounded soldiers in one day and was awarded the title of Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; Raymonda Dien, a French youth who lay down on the tracks to stop a French train carrying munitions to Vietnam, and was unreasonably sentenced to one year in prison by the French government; Jin Di Kang, a Vietnamese shock worker who completed 437% of her production quota; Balvan Shirin, an Iranian female youth who intercepted the Iranian government's shooting at peaceful demonstrators in Tehran and had her legs crushed by a tank; Helda Chadi, a Tunisian female youth who collected 5,000 signatures for the Peace Covenant Declaration; Solar Lewis, a worker from Leeds, England, who collected 3,000 signatures for the Peace Covenant Declaration; Nadi Molinico, an Italian female youth who collected more than 2,000 signatures for the Peace Covenant Declaration; Henke Ikeblatt, a Swedish female youth who collected over 1,600 signatures for the Peace Covenant Declaration; and Jialina Sarlin, a Polish advanced female worker who consistently exceeded her production quota by 80% in celebration of the festival.

The Women's International Democratic Federation also presented honorary gifts to the following two female peace warriors who were unable to attend the conference: Babi from Iraq and Singh from India. Babi participated in the 1948 demonstration protesting the imperialist occupation of Iran and was unreasonably sentenced to life imprisonment for engaging in activities to defend peace; Singh collected 4,000 signatures for the Stockholm Appeal and 27,000 signatures for the Peace Covenant Declaration.

The conference finally unanimously passed a letter to female youth and women of all countries, calling on women all over the world to support the Korean women who are heroically fighting to defend their homeland and to intensify the struggle to defend peace and strive for the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers.
