The Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang Central Committee Spokesman Issues Statement
Denouncing the Sabotage Conspiracy of American Special Agents and Spies
　　[Report from this newspaper] The spokesman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang recently issued a statement on the case of American government special agents and spies conspiring to launch an armed rebellion, which was judged by the Military Control Commission of Beijing Military Court, as follows:
　　On August 17, 1951, the Military Control Commission of the Beijing Military Court, based on the prosecution by the Beijing People's Procuratorate, executed the Chinese people's demand and sentenced a huge case of special agents and spies conspiring to launch an armed rebellion under the command of the US Strategic Intelligence Agency, the US occupying forces headquarters in Tokyo, and the former US Embassy in Beijing Military Attaché Office; The main culprits, Li Andong and Yamaguchi Ryuichi, were executed on the same day after the sentence was pronounced. We fully support the sentencing of this major case. This is another popular move by the Chinese people in the past 110 years after expelling the imperialist forces in China.
　　From this special agent and spy case, we know that the principal culprit, Li Andong, was already an Italian fascist bandit, who had colluded with the Northern Warlords, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the Japanese invaders to harm the Chinese people; Soon after Japan surrendered, he developed a spy relationship with Bao Ruide of the former US Embassy in Beijing Military Attaché Office, and later recruited Japanese special agent Yamaguchi Ryuichi as an informant, and directed other Ma Di Nuo and others who acted as American spies to collect military, political and economic intelligence about our country to supply to American government spy agencies. This shows that the American imperialists inherited the mantle of the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists and intensified their command of special agents to carry out counter-revolutionary activities in China. What is particularly heinous is that these American special agents and spies dared to plan to shell Tiananmen Square during last year's National Day, in an attempt to assassinate our heads of state and other leaders. Our public security organs had already investigated this and cracked it in advance; this group of special agents and spies is now brought to justice and convicted, which is very gratifying. The hideous face of the American imperialists is more clearly exposed in this conspiracy, which is enough to prove that their constant propaganda about how "friendly" they are to China is truly the most shameless.
　　In this regard, we should also be vigilant. American imperialism has always been hostile to the Chinese people; it vainly attempts to direct its special agent pawns to carry out various anti-people activities, and they will not give up until their final defeat. For example, the Shenyang spy case, the Tianjin spy case, and other special agent and spy cases that were previously cracked are directly or indirectly related to American spy agencies. This proves that American imperialism is the biggest and most vicious enemy of the Chinese people. Therefore, we must be vigilant at all times and in all places, assist public security organs and procuratorial organs, eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and continue to resolutely implement the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Only in this way can we consolidate the people's power, ensure the smooth progress of economic construction, and the free and happy life of the people. The strong unity and unparalleled strength of the Chinese people will completely eliminate the remaining reactionary forces and influences of imperialism in China.

The China Democratic League Chairman Zhang Lan Issues Statement
Heartfelt Support for the Judgment of American Special Agents and Spies
　　[Report from this newspaper] Zhang Lan, chairman of the China Democratic League, issued the following statement on the judgment of the Military Control Commission of Beijing on the case of American government special agents and spies conspiring to launch an armed rebellion:
　　The judgment of the Military Control Commission of Beijing on the case of American government special agents and spies conspiring to launch an armed rebellion to endanger our country is a great victory in the struggle to consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship and cut off the American imperialists' claws of conspiracy and sabotage on the Chinese mainland. This is telling the American imperialists and their accomplices with iron facts that no matter what tricks they want to use to sabotage the People's Republic of China, they will be completely defeated before the great strength of the Chinese people!
　　The American imperialist claws, Li Andong, Yamaguchi Ryuichi, and other heinous criminals, not only have they consistently and continuously carried out various conspiracies and sabotage activities on the Chinese mainland before and after liberation, and were hostile to the Chinese people, but also secretly planned to shell the Tiananmen Square reviewing platform on October 1, 1950, our National Day, in an attempt to assassinate our head of state and other leaders of the Central People's Government. What a heinous criminal conspiracy this is! All these conspiracies have now proved to have been carried out under the command of the US Strategic Intelligence Agency, the US occupying forces headquarters in Tokyo, and the former US Embassy in Beijing Military Attaché Office, which naturally further made the Chinese people recognize the hideous face of American imperialism and strengthened the hatred of the entire Chinese people for American imperialism!
　　I now represent the China Democratic League in expressing heartfelt support for the judgment of the Military Control Commission of Beijing on this conspiracy armed rebellion case; I express my sincere condolences to the Beijing People's Public Security Organs for their ability to quickly crack this huge counter-revolutionary case, because their correct and timely measures have protected our great motherland and the free and happy life of the people! In addition, it is also necessary to lead the entire league to educate all our members to accept the profound lessons given to us by this case, and to further improve our vigilance against American imperialist special agent and spy activities in the future! And intensify our struggle against American aggression and to defend national security!

The Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party Chairman Zhang Bojun Speaks
Supporting the Judgment of American Special Agents and Spies
　　[Report from this newspaper] Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, issued the following statement on the judgment of the Beijing Military Control Commission Military Court on the American spy armed rebellion case:
　　The judgment of the Military Control Commission of the Beijing Military Court on the American spy armed rebellion case is a correct measure that fully meets the requirements of the Chinese people. At the same time, it is also a major victory for our people in the struggle to resolutely oppose American aggression and defend the motherland. This victory shows that the Chinese people in the Mao Zedong era can not only smash the shackles imposed on the Chinese people by imperialism for more than a hundred years, but also thoroughly smash any imperialist conspiracy to invade China, and they will definitely be able to completely smash it.
　　American imperialism is determined to be an enemy of the Chinese people. According to the confessions of this group of American spies, criminals such as Li Andong, and various pieces of evidence found, especially in the more than 20 secret letters issued to them by American special agent boss Bao Ruide, it is fully proved that all the evil activities of these special agents and spies were carried out under the direct command of the US Strategic Intelligence Agency, the US occupying forces headquarters in Tokyo, and the former US Embassy in Beijing Military Attaché Office.
　　The American imperialists' heinous conspiracy to harm our country, and the evidence of the crimes committed by Li Andong and other criminals are only a small part of their conspiracy to invade our country.
　　The armed rebellion conspiracy organized and directly commanded by American imperialism has once again completely failed in the face of the Chinese people. We can assert that all the conspiracies and sabotage of imperialism will meet the same fate under the iron fist of the Chinese people.
　　However, we should draw profound lessons from this case, raise our vigilance, and more extensively and deeply intensify the suppression of the spy activities of imperialism and its running dogs, and fight to defend the motherland.

Chinese Zhi Gong Party Spokesperson
Resolutely Supporting the Complete Elimination of American Special Agents and Spies
　　[Report from this newspaper] The spokesperson of the Chinese Zhi Gong Party resolutely supports the government's complete elimination of American special agents and spies' conspiracy activities. The full text is as follows: The Military Control Commission of the Beijing Military Court, based on the prosecution of the Beijing People's Procuratorate, executed Li Andong, Yamaguchi Ryuichi and other American spies on August 17, which is a correct measure that fully meets the requirements of the Chinese people. They are all heinous American imperialist lackeys who invaded China, and were cracked after a long and meticulous investigation by our people's public security organs. This is really a great joy that makes the people of our country clap their hands and cheer, and it is also a major event in the history of our people's opposition to American aggression!
　　This group of inhuman American special agents and spies, under the instructions of their masters, in addition to hiding military arms and weapons and plotting armed rebellion, also planned to shell the Tiananmen Square reviewing platform on last year's National Day, in an attempt to assassinate our heads of state and central leaders. This completely exposes the bloody face of the American government's hostility towards the Chinese people, and also shows that the American imperialists have fully inherited the mantle of fascism and are willing to be the deadly enemy of the entire Chinese people, and even the entire human race.
　　The lesson of this fact should awaken all those who still have illusions about American capitalist civilization. Is such a heinous act "civilized"? Is it "friendly"? From this lesson, the people of our country should further heighten their vigilance and not allow American imperialist spy agencies to have any activities on Chinese soil!
　　We firmly support the Beijing Military Control Commission's judgment this time, and we must also warn American imperialism that no imperialist spy is allowed to exist on our land. The Chinese people, who have stood up, have enough ability to wipe them all out!

The September 3rd Society Chairman Xu Deheng Speaks
Supporting the Thorough Severing of American Aggression Claws
　　[Report from this newspaper] Xu Deheng, Chairman of the September 3rd Society, recently issued a written statement entitled "Thoroughly Eliminate the Criminal Activities of American Imperialist Running Dogs and All Counter-Revolutionary Elements." The full text is as follows:
　　The American imperialist-bred special agents and spies, Li Andong, Yamaguchi Ryuichi, and other heinous bandits, have been sentenced to death and imprisonment by the Military Control Commission of the Beijing Military Court. These ferocious bandits are so crazy and vicious to such an extent that they arrogantly expressed that they would launch a large-scale "challenge" to the Chinese people and the People's Republic of China, and would "serve the United States, the universally recognized leader of the anti-communist camp." They even conspired to launch an armed rebellion and assassinate our heads of state and the Central People's Government and other leaders. For the evil conspiracy of this group of American imperialist claws that invaded China, no one in the entire Chinese people does not express extreme hatred. The judgment of the Military Control Commission of Beijing on the case of American spies conspiring to launch an armed rebellion is a correct measure that fully meets the requirements of the Chinese people.
　　We want to solemnly tell the American imperialists and all counter-revolutionary criminals that any evil conspiracy of yours that is hostile to China and sabotages the free and happy life of the Chinese people will never be realized. The Chinese people have bravely stood up. The Chinese people have victoriously driven away the ferocious imperialists, defeated the fascist rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries who were hated by the Chinese people, and firmly established the people's democratic power. The victorious, unprecedentedly powerful, and unprecedentedly united Chinese people will never allow any murderous and arsonist imperialist robbers to act recklessly in China again, and will never allow any counter-revolutionary criminals to carry out his conspiracies and tricks. We will definitely be able to thoroughly sever the claws of imperialism's aggression against China and thoroughly eliminate the evil activities of all counter-revolutionary elements.
　　The case of Li Andong and Yamaguchi Ryuichi has already proved beyond doubt that American imperialism is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people. The entire Chinese people must always be vigilant against this irreconcilable enemy, intensify their resistance to American aggression, oppose imperialist elements and their running dogs, suppress spy activities, eliminate all counter-revolutionary criminals, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and protect the security of the motherland and the brilliant construction of the new China.

　　各民主党派一致表示  拥护严惩美国特务间谍
    民革中央发言人发表谈话
    痛斥美国特务间谍破坏阴谋
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会中央发言人顷就北京市军事管制委员会军法处判决美国政府特务间谍阴谋武装暴动案，发表谈话如次：
    一九五一年八月十七日，北京市军事管制委员会军法处依据北京市人民检察署的起诉，执行中国人民的要求，判决了先后在美国战略情报局、东京美国占领军总部、前美国大使馆北京武官处指挥之下的特务间谍阴谋武装暴动的巨大案件；主犯李安东、山口隆一已于当日宣判后枪决。我们完全拥护这一巨大案件的判处。这是中国人民一百一十年来在驱逐了帝国主义在华势力之后又一次大快人心的举动。
    从这个特务间谍案件中，我们知道主犯李安东早就是意大利法西斯匪徒，曾与北洋军阀、蒋介石匪帮以及日寇勾结，危害中国人民；日本投降不久，就又与前美国驻华大使馆驻北平武官处包瑞德发生间谍关系，以后收罗日本特务山口隆一充当情报员，并指挥其他充当美国间谍的马迪懦等搜集有关我国军事、政治、经济情报供给美国政府间谍机关。这说明美帝国主义者继承着德、意、日法西斯的衣钵，变本加厉地指挥特务分子在中国进行反革命的勾当。尤其罪大恶极的是，这些美国间谍特务竟敢布置在去年国庆时炮轰天安门，妄图杀害我国元首及其他首长。我公安机关对此早经侦察，先期破获；这批特务间谍现在伏法伏罪，大快人心。美帝国主义者的狰狞面目在这一阴谋中，更为明显的揭露出来，足以证明它们经常宣传对中国如何“友好”，真是无耻之尤了。
    对此，我们还应当提高警惕。美帝国主义敌视中国人民是一贯的；它妄想指挥其特务爪牙进行各种反人民的勾当，它们不到最后失败是不会死心的。例如过去破获的沈阳间谍案、天津间谍案以及其他特务间谍案件，都直接间接与美国的特务机关有关。这在在证明美帝国主义是中国人民最大最凶恶的敌人。所以我们必须随时随地提高警惕，协助公安机关和检察机关，肃清反革命分子，继续坚决执行镇压反革命政策。这样才能巩固人民政权，保障经济建设的顺利进行和人民自由幸福的生活。中国人民坚强的团结和无比的力量，必将帝国主义在华的残余反动势力和影响完全肃清。
    民盟主席张澜发表谈话
    衷心拥护对美国特务间谍的判决
    【本报讯】中国民主同盟主席张澜对于北京市军事管制委员会军法处判决美国政府特务间谍阴谋武装暴动案，发表谈话如下：
    北京市军事管制委员会军法处对于美国政府特务间谍阴谋武装暴动危害我国一案的判决，是巩固我们的人民民主专政，和斩断美国帝国主义在中国大陆上阴谋破坏魔爪的斗争中获得的伟大胜利，这是以铁的事实告诉美国帝国主义者及其帮凶，无论他们想用什么花样，破坏中华人民共和国，在中国人民伟大的力量之前，都会彻底地失败！
    美国帝国主义的魔爪李安东、山口隆一等这一批万恶的罪犯，他们在解放前后，不但在中国大陆上，一贯的继续不断的进行各式各样的阴谋破坏活动，与中国人民为敌，且曾阴谋计划于一九五○年十月一日我国的国庆节炮轰天安门检阅台，企图杀害我国家元首和中央人民政府其他首长，这是何等凶恶的罪恶阴谋！这种种阴谋，现在都证明了是先后在美国战略情报局、东京美国占领军总部、前美国大使馆驻北平武官处指挥之下进行的，自然更进一步的叫中国人民认清了美国帝国主义的狰狞面貌，加强了全中国人民对美国帝国主义的痛恨！
    我现在代表中国民主同盟对北京市军事管制委员会军法处对这一阴谋武装暴动案的判决，表示衷心的拥护；对于北京市人民公安机关能够迅速破获这一巨大的反革命案件表示深挚的感慰，因为他们的正确的及时的措施，保卫了我们伟大的祖国和人民的自由幸福生活！此外还要领导全盟教育我们的全体盟员，接受这一个案件所给我们的深刻教训，在今后对美国帝国主义特务间谍活动，更进一步的提高警惕！并加紧我们的反对美国侵略和保卫国家安全的斗争！
    农工民主党主席章伯钧谈话
    拥护对美国特务间谍的判决
    【本报讯】中国农工民主党中央委员会章伯钧主席，就北京市军事管制委员会军法处，对于美国间谍武装暴动案的判决，发表谈话如下：
    北京市军事管制委员会军法处，对于美国间谍武装暴动案的判决，这是完全符合于中国人民要求的正确措施。同时，也是我国人民在坚决反对美国侵略，保卫祖国的斗争中的一个重大胜利。这个胜利说明，毛泽东时代的中国人民，不仅可以粉碎百余年来帝国主义所加在中国人民身上的枷锁，而且，对于任何帝国主义侵略中国的阴谋破坏，都一定要把它彻底击碎，并且是一定可以把它完全击碎的。
    美帝国主义决心与中国人民为敌，根据这一批美国间谍，李安东等罪犯的供词和搜出的各种罪证，尤其在美国特务头目包瑞德发给他们的二十多件秘密信件中充分证明了，这些特务间谍的一切罪恶活动，都是在美国战略情报局、东京美国占领军总部，以及前美国大使馆驻北平武官处直接指挥之下进行的。
    美帝国主义穷凶极恶地危害我国的阴谋，李安东等犯的罪证，还只是其阴谋侵略我国罪行的一小部分而已。
    美帝国主义所组织所直接指挥的武装暴动阴谋，在中国人民的面前，又一次彻底地失败了。我们可以断言，帝国主义的一切阴谋破坏，在中国人民的铁掌之下，都将遭到同样命运。
    但是，我们是应该从这个案件中得到深刻的教训，提高警惕，更普遍深入地加紧扑灭帝国主义及其走狗的间谍活动，为保卫祖国而斗争。
    中国致公党发言人
    坚决拥护彻底肃清美国特务间谍
    【本报讯】中国致公党发言人坚决拥护政府彻底肃清美国特务间谍阴谋活动，全文如下：北京市军事管制委员会军法处，依据北京市人民检察署的起诉，于八月十七日处决了李安东、山口隆一等一批美国间谍，这是完全符合中国人民要求的正确措施。他们都是罪大恶极的美帝国主义侵华走狗，经我人民公安机关长期缜密侦察后破获的，这实在是使我全国人民拍手称快的一件大喜事，也是我国人民在反对美国侵略史中的一件大事！
    这一批毫无人性的美国特务奸谍，受着他们主子的指使，除隐藏军火武器，阴谋武装暴动之外，并有计划地准备在去年国庆日炮轰天安门检阅台，企图以此杀害我国元首和中央各首长。这完全暴露出美国政府敌视中国人民的血腥面目，也说明了美帝国主义者已十足承袭了法西斯的衣钵，甘心为全中国人民，甚至全人类的死敌。
    这一事实的教训应该使一切对美国资本主义文明还抱有幻想的人们清醒过来了。难道这样的穷凶极恶，是“文明”？是“友善”？从这一教训里，我全国人民应更进一步提高警惕，不让美国帝国主义的间谍机关在中国土地上有任何活动！
    我们坚决拥护北京市军事管制委员会这次的判决，我们更要警告美国帝国主义，在我们的土地上，决不容许有任何帝国主义间谍分子存在，站起来了的中国人民，是有足够能力将他们全部一网打尽的！
    九三学社主席许德珩谈话
    拥护彻底斩断美国侵略魔爪
    【本报讯】九三学社主席许德珩顷发表《彻底肃清美帝国主义走狗及一切反革命分子的罪恶活动》书面谈话。全文如下：
    美帝国主义所豢养的特务间谍李安东、山口隆一等罪大恶极的匪徒，业经北京市军事管制委员会军法处判处了死刑和徒刑。这些凶恶的匪徒居然疯狂毒辣到如此的地步，他们竟狂妄地表示要向我中国人民和中华人民共和国进行一次大规模的“挑战”，要“为反共阵营公认的盟主美国效劳”，他们竟阴谋武装暴动，阴谋杀害我国家元首和中央人民政府及其他各首长。对于这批美帝国主义侵略中国的魔爪的罪恶阴谋，全中国人民，没有一个人不表示极端的痛恨。北京市军事管制委员会军法处对于美国间谍阴谋武装暴动案件的判决，是完全符合中国人民要求的正确措施。
    我们要正告美帝国主义及一切反革命的罪犯，你们任何敌视中国和破坏中国人民自由幸福的生活的罪恶阴谋，是绝对不能实现的。中国人民已经勇敢地站起来了。中国人民已经胜利地赶走了穷凶极恶的帝国主义，打垮了为中国人民所痛恨的国民党反动派的法西斯统治，稳固的建立了人民民主政权。胜利了的空前强大，并且空前团结起来了的中国人民决不容许任何杀人放火的帝国主义强盗再在中国胡作非为，决不容许任何反革命罪犯进行他的阴谋诡计。我们一定能彻底地斩断帝国主义侵略中国的魔爪，彻底肃清一切反革命分子的罪恶活动。
    李安东、山口隆一的案件，已经再明显不过地证明了：美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌。全中国人民对这个不共戴天的敌人必须时时提高警惕，加紧反抗美国侵略，反对帝国主义分子及其走狗，扑灭间谍活动，肃清一切反革命罪犯，巩固人民民主专政，保障祖国的安全和新中国光辉的建设。
