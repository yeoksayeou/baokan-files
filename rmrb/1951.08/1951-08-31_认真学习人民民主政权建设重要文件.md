　　Over the past two years, people's representative conferences at all levels have been widely held throughout the country, uniting people from all walks of life to carry out work together, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and enabling people from all walks of life and all ethnic groups in the country to deeply experience that the power belongs to the people themselves, thereby enhancing patriotic enthusiasm. This achievement is significant.

　　However, there are still many problems in the understanding and work of political power construction in various regions. Our construction work still cannot keep up with the needs of the objective situation and the demands of the broad masses of people. The main reasons for this situation are: many cadres have not paid enough attention to and seriously studied the provisions on political power construction in the Common Program, the relevant policies and decrees of the Central People's Government, and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Third Beijing People's Representative Conference. Some cadres neglect the work of political power construction; others, although they attach importance to it, do not know how to do it. Therefore, organizing cadres at all levels of leadership organs to study in this area has become the primary step in further strengthening the construction of local people's political power. Zhejiang Province has begun to do this, and all parts of the country should do the same.

　　It must be recognized that our political power belongs to the people, and the people's representative conference is the basic system of the state. It must be held on schedule, form a system, and become the central link of all major work and all activities of the people's government, so that it can be established practically rather than formally, and quickly exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress to elect the People's Government Committee, so as to strengthen the leadership of various construction works with such a political power system. The Consultative Committee and the Standing Committee must also be improved to carry out united front work and assist the government in connecting with the people and promoting work. These many basic principles have been clearly stipulated in the Common Program and the relevant decrees of the Central People's Government, and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi has also provided detailed explanations and instructions. As long as these documents are carefully studied and discussed, and their spirit and essence are understood and put into action, our political power construction can be further improved.

　　This kind of learning should be participated in by every cadre. Because political power construction is the fundamental issue of the country, understanding this fundamental issue is necessary for every cadre. However, when arranging the study at present, emphasis should be placed on leading cadres above the county level. Only when their understanding is improved can they educate others and guide the work. The method of study is to carefully read the documents, connect with reality, connect with everyone's ideological understanding, and at the same time check the work, criticize various incorrect understandings of political power construction, and immediately formulate methods to improve the work. Because political power construction is a long-term and important political task and is constantly developing, this kind of learning should be carried out regularly. It is necessary to take some time to carry out a large-scale study at the beginning to attract attention, but one must not be complacent about this and relax regular learning.

　　In order to promote and guide the study of important documents on the construction of people's democratic political power, local newspapers and publishing institutions should strengthen the publicity of this work, government workers should write more articles to newspapers, reflect the actual situation, exchange experiences, raise questions, and launch criticism and self-criticism, and launch debates, in order to deepen the research on the problems and seek a correct and unified understanding. Higher-level leadership organs should provide concrete assistance and guidance to lower-level organs.

　　认真学习人民民主政权建设重要文件
        中央人民政府内务部民政司
    两年来，各级人民代表会议已在全国范围内普遍召开，团结了各界人民共同进行工作，巩固了人民民主专政，使各界人民和国内各民族都能深刻体验到政权是人民自己的，因而提高了爱国主义的热情。这个成绩是很大的。
    但是各地在政权建设的认识上和工作上还存在不少的问题，我们的建政工作还赶不上客观形势的需要和广大人民的要求。造成这种情况的主要原因是：许多干部对于共同纲领中有关政权建设的各项规定、中央人民政府的有关的政策法令和刘少奇副主席在北京第三届人民代表会议上的讲话，没有足够的重视和认真的学习。有的干部忽视政权建设工作；有的虽然重视，却不知如何去作。因此各级领导机关组织干部进行这方面的学习，就成为进一步加强地方人民政权建设的首要步骤。浙江省开始这样做，全国各地也都应这样做。
    必须认识：我们的政权属于人民，人民代表会议是国家的基本制度；必须按期召开，形成制度，成为人民政府的一切重大工作和一切活动的中心环节，使它实际地而不是形式地建立起来，并迅速代行人民代表大会的职权，选举人民政府委员会，以这样的政权制度来加强对各种建设工作的领导；协商委员会和常务委员会也必须健全，以进行统一战线工作和协助政府联系人民，推动工作。这许多基本原则，都已在共同纲领上和中央人民政府的有关法令上规定清楚，刘少奇副主席又曾加以详细的说明和指示，只要对这些文件认真学习和讨论，领会其精神与实质，并见之行动，我们的政权建设是可以进一步作好的。
    这种学习，是每一个干部都应该参加的。因为政权建设是国家的根本问题，了解这一根本问题，对于每一个干部都是必要的。但目前布置学习时，应着重县以上的领导干部。他们的认识提高了，才能去教育别人，才能指导工作。学习的方法，是精读文件，联系实际，联系各个人的思想认识，并同时检查工作，批判对政权建设的各种不正确认识，并立即订出改进工作的办法。由于政权建设是一个长期的重要政治任务，并且在不断地发展，因此这种学习应该经常进行。最初拿出一定的时间大规模进行一次，以引起重视，是必要的，但切不可以此自满，而放松了经常的学习。
    为了推动和指导人民民主政权建设重要文件的学习，各地报纸和出版机关，应加强对这一工作的宣传，政府工作同志应多向报纸写稿，反映实际情况，交流经验，提出问题，并展开批评与自我批评，展开争论，以便加深对问题的研究，求得正确的一致的认识。各上级领导机关，应给下级机关以具体帮助与指导。
