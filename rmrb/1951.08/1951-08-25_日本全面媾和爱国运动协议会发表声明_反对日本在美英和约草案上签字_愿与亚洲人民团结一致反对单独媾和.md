Xinhua News Agency: According to the Japanese newspaper "Peace News," the All-Around Peace Patriotic Movement Council held a presidium meeting on July 20 and passed a statement regarding the US-UK convening of the San Francisco Peace Conference. Those present at the meeting included: Hazahaya Hachijuuni and Osawa Hisaaki of the Japanese Communist Party, Adachi Umeichi and Wada Toshiaki of the Socialist Party Reconstruction faction, Hori Makoto of the Labor-Farmer Party, representatives from the cultural sphere Hirano Yoshitaro and Awaji Tokusaburo, Japanese Farmers Association Chairman Kubota Yutaka, and Chairman of the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Organizations Yoshida Sukeshige, among others.

The statement was issued on July 21 and its summary is as follows:

The United States and the United Kingdom sent invitations to relevant countries on July 20, inviting them to attend the signing ceremony of the peace treaty with Japan to be held in San Francisco on September 4. The treaty to be signed is the US-UK joint draft peace treaty that was announced in July. Japan has no reason to sign this treaty, and almost all Asian countries oppose this draft.

New China, the Soviet Union, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have long expressed their opinions that this draft is invalid. In this way, almost all Asian countries will not participate in the signing. It is completely meaningless for only Western European countries to gather together to decide the primary important issue of Asia – the peace treaty with Japan. Peace, as the word implies, is about creating a state of peace and agreeing that the people of all countries prosper in peace. Therefore, the treaty should be a just and appropriate treaty for peaceful construction.

The US-UK joint draft was formulated by excluding the Soviet Union and New China, so it violates the Potsdam Agreement and is neither just nor appropriate. In particular, Japan wants to seek friendship with China, reopen trade, and gradually develop peaceful industries so as to achieve economic independence. Therefore, we firmly oppose a peace treaty that excludes China. It is completely meaningless to deal with Asian issues by leaving China out.

The Japanese people hope for peace, an end to the occupation, the withdrawal of all foreign troops, and complete independence and freedom. Independence with foreign troops permanently stationed is just like the independence of "Manchukuo," a mere name. Its content is slavery and subordination, and we do not want such independence.

Not only that, but the continued presence of foreign troops and the establishment of military bases risk involving Japan in war and turning it into a battlefield. The result of peace should not be a state of peacebuilding but a dangerous wartime state, which is unacceptable.

The Japan-US stationing agreement will be signed around the time of the peace treaty. This will openly allow the establishment of military bases in Japan, turning Japan into an arsenal hostile to Asia. It is said that a part of the Japan-US stationing agreement is a secret agreement, and the two sides have already concluded a secret military agreement that the Japanese people do not know about. This military agreement concerns military bases and military factories, grants extraterritorial rights, and obligates Japan to assist in the implementation of various foreign military policies. It is extremely undemocratic to decide such important issues related to the destiny of the nation for a hundred years secretly, without consulting the people.

Concluding a treaty like this, which would make Japan a stage for war and revive militarism, is a truly terrible separate peace. This is not a peace treaty but a declaration of preparation for war. It is not settling the aftermath of the war, but preparing for a new war.

After the start of the Korean armistice negotiations and the issuance of the notification for the San Francisco Conference, the Japanese people have clearly understood the true face of a separate peace. If there is a separate peace, Japan will not be able to be independent because Japan will be dragged into war. Therefore, all Japanese people, including workers, farmers, small and medium-sized business owners, cultural figures, and religious figures, have stood up. Everyone has gathered under the banner of the All-Around Peace Patriotic Movement Council, which advocates the immediate conclusion of an all-around peace treaty and opposes rearmament. More than three million signatures have been collected demanding an all-around peace, and they are being collected in large numbers.

In addition, the trade unions of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, guided by the Socialist Party, and religious groups are also carrying out the all-around peace movement. We will cooperate with these groups to fight to the end for Japan's independence and the formation of a strong national front. In order to destroy the separate peace that the nations of Asia oppose, we will join hands with all peace-loving people in Asia and around the world. In order to achieve a just, reasonable, peaceful, and constructive all-around peace treaty based on the Potsdam Declaration, we put forward the following specific slogans: Strive to conclude an all-around peace treaty, centered on the consensus and coordination of the major powers related to Asia – the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. In particular, the participation of New China, which is required by Asian countries, is essential.

Oppose rearmament and smash the revival of aggressive militarism.

Not only oppose secret agreements stipulating the stationing of foreign troops in Japan, but also absolutely oppose all military agreements.

Reject Japan-US economic cooperation as part of the US expansion plan.

Be friendly with China, reopen trade relations, and develop peaceful industries without restriction.

### 日本全面媾和爱国运动协议会发表声明  反对日本在美英和约草案上签字  愿与亚洲人民团结一致反对单独媾和

　　日本全面媾和爱国运动协议会发表声明
    反对日本在美英和约草案上签字
    愿与亚洲人民团结一致反对单独媾和
    【新华社讯】据日本报纸《媾和新闻》消息：全面媾和爱国运动协议会于七月二十日召开主席团会议，对美英两国召开旧金山和会一事，通过了一项声明。出席会议的有：日本共产党的风早八十二、大泽久明，社会党再建派的足立梅市、和田敏明，劳农党的堀真琴，文化界代表平野义太郎、淡德三郎，日本农民协会主席久保田丰，全日本产业别工会会议主席吉田资治等人。
    声明在七月二十一日发表，摘要如下：
    美英两国于七月二十日向有关各国发出了请柬，邀请出席九月四日在旧金山举行的对日和约签字式。准备签订的和约，正是七月间公布的美英共同对日和约草案。日本没有理由要在这个和约上签字，亚洲各国几乎都反对这个草案。
    新中国和苏联以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国早就表明意见，认为这种草案是无效的。这样，亚洲各国几乎都将不参加签字。只有西欧各国聚拢在一起来决定亚洲的首要重要问题——对日媾和，是完全没有意义的。媾和正如字面上的意思一样，是造成和平状态，约定各国人民都在和平之中繁荣。因此，和约应该是公正而妥当、为和平建设的条约。
    美英共同草案是排除苏联和新中国在外而制订的，因此它违反波茨坦协定，既不公正也不妥当。特别是日本想谋致与中国友好，重开贸易，陆续发展和平工业，借使经济自立。所以我们坚决反对排斥中国的媾和。抛开中国来处理亚洲问题完全没有意义。
    日本人民希望媾和，结束占领状态，一切外国军队撤退，获得完全的独立与自由。有着外国军队永远留驻的独立，是和“满洲国”的独立一样，空有其名而已。其内容是奴隶和隶属，我们不要这样的独立。
    不仅如此，外国军队的留驻和建立军事基地，有使日本卷入战争、化为战场的危险。媾和的结果不是和平建设的状态而是危险的战时状态，这是要不得的。
    日美驻兵协定将在和约签字前后签订。这样将可公开地在日本国内建立军事基地，把日本作为以亚洲为敌的兵工厂。据说，日美驻兵协定有一部分是秘密协定，双方已经成立了日本国民并不知道的秘密军事协定。这一军事协定有关军事基地和军事工厂，给予治外法权，并使日本将负有协助实行各种各样的外国军事政策的义务。关系民族百年命运的重要问题，竟不与国民磋商而秘密地决定，是非常不民主的做法。
    像这样缔结和约，将使日本作为战争的舞台，军国主义再度抬头，这真是非常可怕的单独媾和。这不是媾和而是准备战争的宣言。不是料理战争的后事，而是准备新的战争。
    朝鲜停战谈判开始，旧金山会议的通知发出以后，日本人民都清楚地明白了单独媾和的真面目。假使单独媾和，日本是不能够独立的。因为日本将被卷入战争。所以工人、农民、中小企业者、文化人、宗教家等全体日本人民都起来了。人人都集结到全面媾和爱国运动协议会所揭橥的立即缔结全面和约、反对重新武装的旗帜下。要求全面媾和的签名已经超过了三百万，并且正在大量征集中。
    此外，社会党所指导的日本工会总评议会系统的工会与宗教家团体也在展开全面媾和运动。我们将与这些团体合作，为日本的独立、结成坚强的民族战线而斗争到底。为了摧毁亚洲各民族所反对的单独媾和，将与全亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民携手并进。我们为了实现以波茨坦宣言为基础的公正、合理、和平、建设性的全面媾和，提出下列具体的口号：以与亚洲有关的大国——苏、中、美、英的意见一致和协调为中心，设法缔结全面和约。特别是必须有亚洲各国所要求的新中国的参加。
    反对重新武装，粉碎侵略性的军国主义的复活。
    不仅反对规定外国军队留驻日本的秘密协定，也绝对反对一切军事协定。
    拒绝为美国扩军计划一部分的日美经济合作。
    与中国友好，重开贸易关系，无限制发展和平工业。
