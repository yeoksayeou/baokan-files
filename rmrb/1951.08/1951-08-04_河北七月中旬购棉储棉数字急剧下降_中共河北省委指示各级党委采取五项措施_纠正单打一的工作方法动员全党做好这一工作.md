After the Hebei Provincial Financial and Economic Committee organized an inspection team in late June to inspect cotton purchase and storage work in cotton-producing areas, the Xingtai, Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Hengshui special districts successively organized a large number of cadres to go to various counties, districts, and villages to inspect and assist in this work. The province's cotton purchasing and storage figures rose significantly in early July. On July 8, the province's cotton purchase figure reached more than 470,000 jin. However, since mid-July, the province's cotton purchase figures have dropped sharply again. For example, on July 18, only 202,078 jin were collected, a decrease of more than 50 percent compared with the cotton purchase figure on July 8.

Why?

Why did this happen? There are several reasons: (1) Cotton aphids became a disaster in cotton-producing areas. In mid-July, the area affected by aphids in the province reached 11 million mu. Some counties adopted the "single-handed" work method, stopping all work and concentrating on aphid control; although some counties proposed combining aphid control with cotton purchase and storage work, due to a lack of combined methods and negligence in inspection, cotton purchase and storage had actually stopped. (2) Some cadres, especially district cadres, still do not understand the importance and urgency of cotton purchase and storage, blindly shouting "the task is too big, the inventory is too small, and it is impossible to complete the task at all." Some even mistakenly found a village with the smallest cotton inventory to do the math, as a basis for resisting the task. Some also adopted coercive orders or assigned cotton purchase quotas per mu, which seriously alienated the masses. (3) Cotton yarn and cloth companies and cooperatives did not cooperate closely in cotton purchase and storage, and even competed for the market and petty profits. For example, the Xingtai Special District Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the cooperative had disagreements on the acquisition area. The company said that the cooperative could not handle it, and the cooperative asked the company's acquisition team to close down, which seriously affected the acquisition work. (4) When arranging cotton purchase and storage work, some special districts mechanically required it to end on July 15. When the time came, the task was not completed, and no arrangements were made in time, causing some cadres to believe that "the assault period is over, and the work is over." (5) Some cadres in the acquisition work emphasized cotton-producing villages and neglected general villages, emphasized large households and neglected small households. As a result, a large amount of cotton was abandoned, because although the amount of cotton stored in each village and household in general villages and small households was small, the total number added up was very large. In addition, general areas pay attention to acquisition and neglect storage. There is only a general call for cotton storage, lacking specific plans and organization. As a result, the province's cotton storage in June was only more than 70,000 jin, accounting for 1.5 percent of the total amount of cotton purchased and stored.

What to do?

From July 1 to 20, the province's cotton collection was 4.7 million jin. Together with the cotton collected in May and June, the total was more than 18 million jin, accounting for only over 36 percent of the total requirement. But time is running out. To this end, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee issued instructions on July 23, requiring party committees at all levels to take the following measures:

(1) Continue to educate party members and cadres to attach importance to cotton sales and storage. The instructions pointed out: The phenomenon of not paying attention to this work is still serious, and must be strictly criticized and corrected. Regarding cotton purchase and storage as a simple business or as an easy task, thus relaxing leadership, is a serious political error. Underestimating the amount of cotton stored by cotton farmers, thus being pessimistic and disappointed, is also unfounded. The current small amount of cotton purchased is not because cotton farmers have a small inventory, but because the work has not been done well.

(2) Correct the "single-handed" work method and mobilize the whole party to carry out cotton purchase and storage work. In carrying out aphid control, locust control, and drought resistance work in cotton-producing areas, cotton purchase and storage work must be closely integrated. Cotton purchase and storage is one of the central tasks in cotton-producing areas, and it is also an urgent task. It is wrong to abandon cotton purchase work due to other work. This work is not only the responsibility of governments at all levels and various specialized departments, but also the responsibility of the whole party.

(3) Extend the time for completing the cotton purchase and storage task to before the new cotton is on the market. In addition to in-depth publicity to reach every household, we must also focus on the middle peasant class with the largest amount of cotton storage, and mobilize them to sell and store cotton to the state.

(4) Based on the current work situation, report and introduce experiences, commend model units, and criticize backward units. Work units and staff members of cotton yarn and cloth companies and cooperatives who have affected the acquisition task due to mutual competition for profits should be punished, and education should be conducted in the whole party to correct the departmentalism of party members and cadres who disregard the overall situation.

(5) Designate special departments to make specific plans for cotton storage work and implement them.

### 河北七月中旬购棉储棉数字急剧下降  中共河北省委指示各级党委采取五项措施  纠正单打一的工作方法动员全党做好这一工作

　　河北七月中旬购棉储棉数字急剧下降
    中共河北省委指示各级党委采取五项措施
    纠正单打一的工作方法动员全党做好这一工作
    河北省财政经济委员会组织检查团于六月下旬到产棉区检查购棉储棉工作以后，邢台、邯郸、石家庄、衡水各专区都相继组织了大批干部分赴各县、区、村检查、帮助这一工作。全省的购棉储棉数字，在七月上旬曾显著上升。七月八日，全省购棉数字曾高达四十七万余斤。但自七月中旬以后，全省购棉数字又急剧下降。如七月十八日仅收二十万二千零七十八斤。与七月八日购棉数字相较，减少百分之五十以上。
    为什么？
    为什么会发生这种情况呢？有以下几种原因：（一）产棉区棉蚜成灾，七月中旬全省蚜虫为害面积竟达一千一百万亩之多。有的县份采取“单打一”的工作方法停止一切工作，集中除蚜；有的县份虽提出治蚜与购、储棉工作结合，但因为缺乏结合办法与疏于检查，购棉储棉实际上也已停止。（二）有些干部，特别是区干部，仍然不懂得购棉储棉的重要性与迫切性，盲目地叫喊“任务太大，存量很小，根本完不成任务”。甚至错误地找个存棉量最少的村庄算个账，作为根据，抵抗任务。也有的采用强迫命令或按亩摊派征购棉花的办法，严重地脱离了群众。（三）花纱布公司与合作社在购、储棉工作上配合得不紧密，甚至互相争夺市场，互争小利。如邢台专区花纱布公司与合作社，在收购地区上闹意见，公司说合作社包不起来，合作社叫公司收购组收摊，使收购工作受到严重影响。（四）布置购储棉花工作时，有的专区机械地要求在七月十五日结束。时间到了，任务未完成，也未及时再作布置，致有些干部认为“突击期过了，工作结束了”。（五）有些干部在收购工作中，重视产棉村、轻视一般村，重视大户、轻视小户。结果是放弃了大宗棉花。因为一般村及小户每一村一户存棉量虽小，但整个加起来数目却是很大的。此外，一般地区都重视收购，轻视储存。储棉只有一般号召，缺乏具体计划与组织工作。因而全省六月份储棉仅七万余斤，占购储棉花总量的百分之一点五。
    怎么办？
    自七月一日至二十日，全省收棉数四百七十余万斤，连五、六月份收棉数总计一千八百余万斤，仅占总要求数的百分之三十六强。但时间已很紧迫。为此，中共河北省委又于七月二十三日发出指示，要求各级党委采取如下措施：
    （一）继续教育党员干部，重视售棉储棉工作。指示指出：目前不重视这一工作的现象仍然严重存在，必须加以严格批判，纠正。把购储棉花视为简单的做买卖或视为轻易的工作，因而放松领导，是严重的政治错误。低估棉农存棉数量，因而悲观失望，也是没有根据的。目前收购棉数量小，并不是因为棉农存量小，而是由于工作没有作好。
    （二）纠正“单打一”的工作方法，发动全党进行购储棉花的工作。产棉区在进行除蚜、捕蝗、抗旱工作中，必须紧密结合购储棉花工作。购、储棉花是产棉区中心工作之一，也是紧急工作之一，因其他工作而放弃购棉工作是不对的。这一工作不仅是各级政府与各专管部门的责任，也是全党的责任。
    （三）把完成购储棉花任务的时间推到新花上市前。工作中除要深入宣传，达到家喻户晓外，还要特别着重对准存棉量最大的中农阶层，发动他们把棉花售储给国家。
    （四）根据目前工作情况，通报介绍经验，表扬模范单位，批评落后单位。对花纱布公司与合作社因互相争利而影响收购任务的工作单位与工作人员应给予处分，并在全党进行教育，纠正党员干部不顾大体的本位主义思想。
    （五）指定专署部门做出储棉工作的具体计划，并付诸实施。
