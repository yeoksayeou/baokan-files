Title: Lack of Sincerity in Ceasefire Negotiations Fully Exposed: US Side Actually Raises Absurd and Unreasonable Demands, Using the Pretext of Naval and Air Force "Power" to Coerce Moving the Demarcation Line Northward; Chinese and Foreign Journalists Expose US Conspiracy and Support Our Reasonable Proposals

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 4th: This reporter has learned from the Korean Front Headquarters that the 19th meeting of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Conference began at 10:00 AM (Korean time) on August 4th. No progress was made on the issue of establishing a military demarcation line to establish a demilitarized zone. At 1:05 PM, the United Nations Command delegation suggested adjourning the meeting. The 20th meeting is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on August 5th.

US Side Wants to Threaten and Deceive at the Negotiating Table, Fully Exposing Ambition to Continue Expanding the War

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 4th: The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao published a special dispatch from its special correspondent in Kaesong, Korea, on August 3rd, stating: We ask the people of the world to judge: Where should the military demarcation line be drawn for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War? We propose the "38th Parallel" as the boundary. According to rumors from Tokyo, Munsan, and Washington, the other side not only refuses but also demands that the demarcation line be north of the "38th Parallel." We cannot agree to either moving the demarcation line further north or a ceasefire in place.

The other side's demands are arrogant and barbaric. It is rumored that their one-sided reasons are nothing more than boasting about the "power" of their naval and air forces, as if we don't know what their planes and warships are; they actually think that their naval and air forces control the seas and skies of Korea, and that once a ceasefire is reached, in order to compensate for this "loss of advantage," the demarcation line should be moved further north.

Using the "power" of the naval and air forces as a threat, wanting to occupy more territory in such a ceasefire... wanting to threaten and deceive at the negotiating table is simply a pipe dream. Enemy planes and warships have already proven in the war over the past year that they cannot affect our army's offensives and blockades. The only effect they have is to massacre the Korean people and destroy property. Such atrocities are known throughout the world.

Since the war has moved back and forth across the "38th Parallel," our proposal to use the "38th Parallel" as the boundary is indeed in line with military reality, fair, and reasonable. Not doing so would be detrimental to a peaceful resolution of the Korean War and would not provide a basis for a ceasefire.

In another dispatch, the newspaper's special correspondent revealed the US side's repeated lack of sincerity, its inching forward, and its use of violence to coerce. He emphasized that during the ceasefire negotiations, the enemy's arrogant actions have exposed their ambition to continue aggression and expand the war, and the Chinese and Korean people should pay close attention to this.

The 38th Parallel Should Serve as the Military Demarcation Line Between the Two Sides: The US's Absurd and Unreasonable Conditions Will Never Be Realized

This newspaper's report: According to Alan, a reporter for the British Worker's Daily, in a report from Kaesong on the 3rd: The Americans have been playing the greatest deception on world public opinion, and they are not letting their own reporters know about this deception. Jacques Lequertier, of Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, first broke the silence by saying that the United States wants to draw the demarcation line between the Yalu River and the current front line. Authoritative sources here revealed tonight that the United States has been demanding in the conference that the demarcation line not only be north of the 38th Parallel but also be north of the current front line, deep inside North Korea. They gave the absurd reason that the land war is evenly matched, but they have air and naval superiority, and Korea and China must give some "compensation" to the United States for these two weapons that can reach the Yalu River. In addition to the above reasons, the Americans also said that the demarcation line they are asking to establish is a defensible line for both sides. The Americans' reasons are so untenable that they are too embarrassed to present these reasons to the public. The US Air Force and Navy are only capable of committing atrocities against civilians - their military value is very small. This is obvious because US troops can only barely, temporarily, and unstably hold the front line with the help of the air and naval forces. Without the air and naval forces, they would have been in the sea long ago. There is no such thing as an independent advantage of air and naval forces. Korea and China believe that the American emphasis on a defensible line is a dangerous and malicious symbol.

The Korean armistice is the first step toward a peaceful solution, not a new step toward war. The best guarantee of security for both sides is to establish a line and a demilitarized zone agreed upon by both sides and to adhere to this measure. The Americans have chosen a dangerous and completely bankrupt premise: that North Koreans attacked South Korea and will attack again. The main argument for using the 38th Parallel as the boundary is very clear and undeniable: it is a military reality. Both sides have crossed this line twice, occupying front lines and areas of roughly equal distance. The Korean and Chinese forces crossed the 38th Parallel further south than the US forces crossed the 38th Parallel north. The whole world has recognized the 38th Parallel as the basis for a peaceful solution. Moreover, this line should be regarded as the basis for peace and, after the withdrawal of foreign troops, as the basis for the Korean people to resolve their own internal affairs. The Americans only regard it as a military line related to their future war aims. Another important reason is that the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the war was the result of the United States ignoring China's warnings. China warned the Americans not to cross the 38th Parallel and advance towards the Yalu River. To restore the previous situation, it is necessary to re-establish this line. Finally, negotiations only began because Malik proposed using the 38th Parallel as the basis for negotiations. Yesterday, Pyongyang was subjected to a particularly severe air raid. This is the American policy - using the air force, navy, and various propaganda tools on the American side to force the Koreans and Chinese to accept their conditions. They have put forward absurd conditions at the meeting, not letting the world know these conditions, and attempting to achieve their goals by military force. They will not succeed. The Koreans and Chinese have demonstrated their peaceful views and are prepared to let the world judge whether these views are fair and reasonable. They are also prepared to deal with any events that may occur in the future.

US Naval and Air Forces Can Only Bomb Unprotected Villages, Cannot Move the US Military Front Line Forward by One Meter

This newspaper's report: According to Jacques Bertin, a reporter for France's Paris-Soir, in a report from Kaesong on the 3rd: Authoritative sources here revealed tonight that the United States is concealing its aim in the ceasefire negotiations by remaining silent. The United States is demanding that the demarcation line be moved significantly north from the current front line, deep into North Korea. The United States is concealing this from the reporters covering the Kaesong negotiations but is allowing and encouraging Agence France-Presse to spread shameless arguments to support its demands, saying that if the ground forces of both sides are roughly evenly matched, their air and naval forces can operate deep north of the Yalu River. They are demanding land to compensate for their alleged advantage in air and naval forces. The hypocrisy of this argument has been demonstrated by the fact that the exaggerated atrocities of the air and naval forces bombing unprotected villages cannot move their front line forward by one meter. The air and naval forces are only used to commit various atrocities and have not achieved military objectives. The demand to establish a line across North Korea fully proves that the United States has no confidence in a peaceful solution.

The air and naval superiority allows them to barely, temporarily, and unstably hold their current front line. Otherwise, they would have been driven out of Korea long ago. Therefore, the argument to push their front line northward into territory they are militarily unable to occupy is shameless and not worth discussing. North Korea and China thoroughly refuted the excuse of the so-called defensible demarcation line. They pointed out that the ceasefire negotiations and the armistice are the first step towards a comprehensive solution to the Korean issue, a step that should lead to the withdrawal of foreign troops and the peaceful resolution of the entire issue, rather than to continued war. The American theory is that the line is to defend against some assumed North Korean attack, and the intention of this theory is to shift the responsibility for launching the aggression to the North Korean side. This attitude has been completely refuted.

The view of North Korea and China is that the 38th Parallel is not only a fair demarcation line recognized by the world but also a militarily reasonable demarcation line recognized by the world. Both sides have been north of the 38th Parallel twice and south of the 38th Parallel twice. Since the beginning of this year, North Korea and China have been south of the 38th Parallel for five months, occupying a large area, and the United States has occupied an area north of the 38th Parallel for two months. The war has always been fought back and forth on both sides of the 38th Parallel, and the area occupied by the North Korean army in the south and the area occupied by the US army in the north are almost equal. North Korea does not recognize the 38th Parallel as the final and definitive division of the Korean nation, but it recognizes that determining the 38th Parallel as the demarcation line is the first step towards peacefully deciding the future of Korea without foreign interference.

As for the Chinese People's Volunteers, they came to Korea after the US military ignored China's warnings and advanced across the 38th Parallel towards the Yalu River. China demands a solution based on the 38th Parallel as the first step towards a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The United States accepted Malik's proposal for a ceasefire at the 38th Parallel as the basis for the current negotiations precisely because world opinion recognized that this proposal was fair and reasonable.

The US military is now intensifying its bombing and shelling atrocities to put pressure on the negotiations. Acheson's rejection of the 38th Parallel, Wedemeyer's clamor to use the atomic bomb in Korea, and the US planes' renewed terrorist attacks on Pyongyang and heavy bombing of Wonsan are all aimed at intimidating and making US power play a role in the ceasefire negotiations. Therefore, the North Korean and Chinese sides are increasingly suspicious of whether the United States is truly sincere in negotiating a solution to the problem through negotiations. Today, when the US military released news to reporters, it said cautiously: In drawing the demarcation line, not only the ground forces must play a role, but also the air and naval forces. However, the real reason why the United States made this absurd demand has still not been announced to the American and world opinion.

Joy is Playing Lawyer's Tricks at the Negotiation Table and Also Spreading False News to Deceive the American and World People

This newspaper's report: According to Jacques Bertin, a reporter for France's Paris-Soir, in a report from Kaesong on the 2nd: The US representatives at the ceasefire negotiations are still demanding a line north of the current front line, deep into North Korean territory, as the demarcation line. Reliable sources here revealed this tonight, thus resolutely denying the news spread by Western news agencies that the US side is demanding a demarcation line on or near the current front line. This kind of news is worthless in the eyes of the public. It is obvious that the US press officer, Nuckols, is deliberately deceiving Western reporters on this issue. At today's meeting, General Nam Il, the chief representative of the Korean delegation, directly asked General Joy why he wanted to push the demarcation line north of the current front line, deep into North Korean territory. Joy did not answer, but instead played lawyer's tricks, demanding that the other party give a yes or no answer to the issue of responsibility for the safety of military commanders. This issue had already been answered by General Nam Il, who had repeatedly pointed out that the greatest safety for the troops is the demarcation line of the demilitarized zone based on the 38th Parallel. Acheson's ultimatum rejecting the 38th Parallel poured cold water on today's meeting and brought the language of 19th-century gunboat diplomacy to the negotiations again. Acheson also attacked the issue of removing the issue of foreign troops from the agenda. This issue was removed for the sake of peace. This time he obviously intends to have the same result again, but this time he will fail. The Koreans and Chinese are deeply concerned about peace, but they want lasting peace and not one that is subject to pricing by others. Here, Washington seems to have completely misunderstood the situation. Here, for the first time in history, Asia and the West are holding meetings on an equal footing. This is Asia's armed resistance against Western imperialism. The question of war or peace must be faced squarely, and if it is war, the responsibility lies entirely with the American side. General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, addressed the issue squarely in a statement before Acheson's speech, saying that if the United States insists on unreasonable conditions, causing the negotiations to fail, the military consequences will not be optimistic for the United States. It is becoming increasingly clear that the US is negotiating to appease domestic public opinion that is calling for an end to the senseless slaughter. They originally had no sincerity in ending the war. They are deceiving American and world opinion by releasing false news to their reporters. The method they have proposed at the meeting is to have North Korea surrender a large part of its territory without a fight, or to continue large-scale hostilities, which may be even more brutal than before. This is a confirmed fact. The United States has already established bases around the world under the pretext of "defense lines." Now this argument is not valid. Here, there is a very realistic understanding of America's war aims.

The 38th Parallel is a Fair and Reasonable Boundary of Peace: The US Refusal to Accept it is a Conspiracy to Continue Aggression

This newspaper's report: According to Jacques Bertin, a reporter for France's Paris-Soir, in a report from Kaesong on the 1st: Authoritative sources here today denied the news that the US press officer claimed that a definitive agreement to continue hostilities had been reached at Monday's ceasefire negotiations. A statement hastily circulated among American reporters said that "the only agreement reached was to continue fighting." This statement is completely fabricated to cover up the most violent bombing of Pyongyang and the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians. The fact that negotiations on the demarcation line are continuing, and the news that the Western camp is suggesting that the Americans may compromise on this issue, have rekindled hope that this key issue can be resolved. The Americans complained that if they accept the 38th Parallel as the demarcation line, they would have to give up "land that was hard-won." This is nonsense. Currently, the North Koreans hold 3,630 square kilometers of land south of the 38th Parallel on a 145-kilometer line, while the Americans occupy 4,630 square kilometers of land north of the 38th Parallel on a 145-kilometer line. If both sides withdraw 10 kilometers from the agreed line and establish supervisory groups to supervise that neither side assembles forces for a new offensive, then the demand for a defensible military line is ridiculous. The US insistence on this demand is detrimental to any final peaceful solution. The North Koreans and Chinese interpret the term "defensible line" as a "starting point" for new offensives. They have rich experience in imperialist tricks. Their argument is peaceful, using the cessation of the slaughter of soldiers and civilians in Korea as the first step towards world peace. The American argument is one of force and continued war. The 38th Parallel is a boundary of peace that offers no military advantage to either side. Whether or not this point is accepted is considered a litmus test of whether the United States truly wants peace, or whether they are simply trying to buy time to launch a new offensive after the rainy season is over. It has now been discovered that during yesterday's large-scale air raid on Pyongyang, the US not only had to bomb indiscriminately because of the weather, as they now admit, but they also dropped "bait mines" disguised as children's toys and fountain pens, blowing to pieces children and others who went to pick them up. This is the truth about the "candy curtain" picture. The so-called "candy curtain" picture is a picture taken by a few Americans who threw some candy to Korean children and had reporters take some photos. In Kaesong, there are hundreds of out-of-school children, and here are a few children vying for American candy. When these children threw the candy back at the soldiers who had caused them to lose their homes, become orphans, and rape their sisters and mothers in front of the war correspondents accompanying these soldiers, the reporters told the Western world that these children were acting on "military orders."

　　对停战谈判缺乏诚意暴露无遗
    美方竟提荒谬无理要求
    借口海空军“威力”要挟将分界线向北移
    中外记者揭露美方阴谋拥护我合理主张
    【新华社平壤四日电】本社记者自朝鲜前线总部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议第十九次会议，在八月四日上午十时（朝鲜时间）开始。对于确立军事分界线，以建立非军事地区的问题，并未获得任何进展。下午一时零五分，由联合国军代表团建议休会。第二十次会议定于八月五日上午十时举行。
    美方想在谈判桌上威胁欺骗  充分暴露继续扩大战争野心
    【新华社上海四日电】八月三日上海大公报刊载该报特派记者自朝鲜开城发出专电称：我们要求全世界人民来判断：为求和平解决朝鲜战争，究竟双方的军事分界线应该划分在那里？我们提出以“三八线”为界。据东京、汶山及华盛顿传闻，对方不但拒绝，而且要求分界线在“三八线”以北。无论分界线更北推或就地停战，我们都不能同意。
    对方的要求是狂妄而蛮横的，据传他们的片面的理由不外乎侈谈他们海、空军的“威力”如何如何，好像我们从不知道他们的飞机、军舰是什么东西；竟然以为他们的海、空军控制了朝鲜的海面与空中，一旦停战，为了补偿这种“优势的损失”，分界线应更往北移。
    以海空军的“威力”作要挟，想在这样的停战中多占阵地，……想在谈判桌上威胁诱骗，这简直是痴人说梦。敌机、敌舰一年来已在战争中证明根本不能影响我军的进攻和阻击，唯一的效用是屠杀朝鲜人民，毁坏财产。这类暴行是举世周知的。
    由于战事往返于“三八线”上，我们提出以“三八线”为界，确合乎军事实际，公平合理，不这样便不利于和平解决朝鲜战争，也得不到休战基础。
    该报特派记者在另一电讯中揭露了美方一再表现缺乏诚意，得寸进尺，并以暴力来胁迫的行为，并强调称：在停战谈判期间，敌方的这种狂妄行动，已暴露了其继续侵略扩大战争的野心，中朝人民应予以严密注视。
  三八线应作为双方军事分界线  美国荒谬绝伦条件永不会实现
    【本报讯】据英国工人日报记者阿兰三日自开城报道：美国人一直对世界公众玩弄最大的一个欺骗，他们也不让他们自己的记者知道这个欺骗。东京法新社记者李克首先打破沉默说，美国要把分界线划在鸭绿江和目前战线之间。此间权威人士今夜透露，美国人在会议中一直要求，分界线不但要在三八线以北，并且要在目前的战线以北，深入北朝鲜内。他们提出荒谬的理由说，陆地战争是势均力敌的，但他们占有空军和海军优势，朝鲜和中国必须对美国握有的这两种能够到鸭绿江的武器给予一些“补偿”，除了上述的理由外，美国人又说他们所要求建立的分界线是双方都可以防守的线。美国的理由是这样不足取，以至于他们无脸把这些理由向公众提出。美国的空军海军只有能力对平民干出暴行来——军事价值是非常少的。这是很明显的，因为美国部队只能靠海空军勉强暂时地及不稳固地守住战线，如果没有海空军的话，他们早已经到海里去了，没有像海空部队独立优势这样的事。朝鲜和中国认为美国强调可防守的线是一个危险的恶意的象征。
    朝鲜停战是和平解决的第一步，不是走向战争的新步骤。双方安全的最好保证就是建立经双方同意的界线和非军事区并坚持这种措施。美国人选择了一个危险的而且完全破了产的前提，就是：北朝鲜人进攻南朝鲜，而且还要进攻。以三八线为界的主要论据是很明白的，而且是无可争辩的：它是一个军事现实，双方都曾两度越过这条线，双方都曾两度越过这条线占据了距离差不多相等的战线和地区，朝中部队越过三八线以南比美军越过三八线以北的还要远一些，全世界都已承认三八线是和平解决的基础。而且，应该把这条界线看作和平的基础，而在外国军队撤退以后，又是朝鲜人民自己解决内政问题的基础。美国人只是把它当作与他们未来的战争目的有关的军事界线。还有一个最重要的理由是：中国志愿军参加战争是美国人不顾中国警告的结果。中国曾警告美国人，叫他们不要越过三八线向鸭绿江推进。要恢复从前的局面就必须重新建立这一条界线。最后，由于马立克提出了以三八线为谈判基础的建议，谈判才开始。昨天，平壤又遭受了特别厉害的空袭。这是美国的政策——利用空军海军及美国方面的各种宣传工具，以图迫使朝鲜人及中国人接受他们的条件。他们在会上提出了荒谬绝伦的条件，不让世人知道这些条件并企图用军事力量来达到他们的目的。他们是不会成功的。朝鲜人和中国人已经表明了他们的和平观点，并准备让全世界来判断这种观点是否公平合理。他们同样地也准备应付将来可能发生的任何事件。
    美海空军只能轰炸不设防村庄  不能把美军战线向前移一公尺
    【本报讯】据法国巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌三日自开城报道：这里权威人士今天晚上揭露美国以沉默来掩饰它在停火谈判中的目的一事时透露：美国要求把分界线从现在的战线上大大地向北移，深入北朝鲜。美国向采访开城谈判的记者们掩饰这一点，可是又允许并且怂恿法新社散布无耻的议论，用来支持它的要求，这种议论说：如果双方地面部队大约势均力敌的话，而他们的空军和海军却能够深入鸭绿江以北去活动。他们要求用土地去补偿他们自称在空军和海军方面的优势。这种议论的虚伪，已经由这一件事实表明，那就是：夸大了的海空军轰炸不设防村庄的暴行，不能叫他们的战线往前移一公尺。空军和海军兵力，只用去犯各种暴行，并没有达到军事目的。关于建立横贯北朝鲜的防线的要求，完全证明了美国没有和平解决问题的信心。
    空军和海军的优势，使他们勉强暂时而不巩固地守住现在的防线。要不是这样，他们早就被赶出朝鲜去了，所以这种将他们的防线向北推入他们在军事上无力占领的领土的论据，是无耻而不值一谈的。北朝鲜和中国彻底地驳斥了所谓可以防守的分界线的借口。他们指出，停火谈判和停战，是全面解决朝鲜问题的第一步，这一步是要导向撤退外国军队而和平解决整个问题的，而不是要导向继续战争。美国的理论是：防线是要防备某种假定的北朝鲜攻击，这种理论的用意是把原来发动侵略的责任，转嫁给北朝鲜方面。这种态度已经完全被驳斥了。
    北朝鲜和中国的观点是：三八线不仅是举世公认的合理的分界线，在军事上也是举世公认的合理的分界线。双方都曾经两次在三八线以北，两次在三八线以南。自从今年年初以来，北朝鲜和中国有五个月在三八线以南，占领了广大地区，美国有两个月占领了三八线以北的地区。战事一向反复在三八线两侧进行，北朝鲜军所占领的南部地带和美军所占领的北部地带，是几乎相等的。北朝鲜并不承认三八线是朝鲜国最后的确定的划分，但承认确定三八线为分界线是走向不靠外国干涉而和平地决定朝鲜前途的第一步。
    至于中国人民志愿军这一方面呢，他们是在美军漠视中国的警告越过三八线而向鸭绿江前进以后来到朝鲜的。中国要求以三八线为基础的解决，而以此作为和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。美国接受了马立克所提出在三八线停火的建议，作为目前谈判的基础，恰恰是因为世界舆论都承认这个建议是公正合理的。
    美军现在益发加紧干出轰炸和轰击的暴行，借以对谈判施压力。艾奇逊拒绝三八线，魏德迈叫嚣在朝鲜使用原子弹，美机昨天再次对平壤施以恐怖袭击，猛烈轰击元山，这些行动的目的都是实行恫吓而使美军威力在停火谈判中起作用。因此，北朝鲜和中国方面就日益怀疑美国谈判时是否真正怀有用谈判方法解决问题的诚意了。今天美军方面在向记者们发布新闻的时候，以谨慎的辞句说：在划定分界线上，不仅地面部队必须起作用，而且海空军也必须起作用。可是美国所以提出这种荒谬要求的真正原因，仍然没有向美国和世界舆论公布。
    乔埃在谈判会上玩弄讼棍的花样  还发假消息欺骗美国和世界人民
    【本报讯】据法国巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌二日自开城报道：停火谈判的美方代表仍要求以目前战线以北，深入北朝鲜领土的一条线为分界线。此间可靠人士今晚透露了这一点，这样一来就断然否认了西方通讯社所传布的美方要求在目前战线上或战线附近划界线的消息。这种消息在社会人士心目中是一钱不值了。美国新闻发布官纳科斯在这个问题上有意蒙骗西方记者是很明显的。今天会议上，朝鲜代表团首席代表南日将军率直向乔埃将军提出问题，问他为什么想把分界线推向目前战线以北，深入北朝鲜地区。乔埃不作答复，反而玩讼棍的花样，要求对方对于军事指挥官的安全责任问题作是或否的答复。这个问题本已由南日将军给以答复，南日将军曾一再指出，对于军队的最大的安全就是以三八线为基础的非军事区的界线。艾奇逊的拒绝以三八线为界的最后通牒给今天的会议泼了一桶冷水，又再把十九世纪炮舰外交的语言拿到谈判上来用。艾奇逊对于把外国军队问题自议程上撤消的问题，同样大事攻击。为了和平的利益，这个问题撤消了。这次他显然打算又会有同样的结果，但这次他将会失败。朝鲜人中国人深深关心和平，但他们所要的是持久的和平，而且不是听由人家索价的。在这里，华盛顿似乎把形势完全了解错了，在这里，历史上第一次亚洲和西方平等地举行会议，这是亚洲对西方帝国主义进行武装反抗而赢得的。战争或是和平的问题必须加以正视，如果是战争的话，责任完全在美国方面。中国志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在艾奇逊演说之前的一个声明中是正视了问题的，他说，如果美国坚执无理的条件，使得谈判失败，军事后果对于美国来说并不乐观。越来越明显，美方的从事谈判是要平息国内纷纷要求结束无谓屠杀的舆论。他们本来就没有但求结束战争的诚意。他们用向他们的记者发布假消息的办法来欺骗美国和世界的舆论。他们在会议上提出的办法是要北朝鲜不战而交出他的领土的大部分，否则就继续进行大规模的敌对行动，甚至可能比以往的更加残酷，这是一个确凿的事实。美国已以“防线”为理由而在环球遍设基地，现在这个论点是行不通了，在这里对于美国的战争目的是有十分现实的认识的。
    三八线是公平合理的和平疆界  美方拒不接受是阴谋继续侵略
    【本报讯】据法国巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌一日自开城报道：美国新闻发布官声言星期一的停战谈判会上已获致确定的协议继续敌对活动，这个消息，此间权威人士今日予以否认。美国记者中所急急传播的一个声明说“所获致的唯一的协议就是继续作战”。这个声明完全是捏造来掩饰对平壤最猛烈的轰炸和任意屠杀平民的行为的。关于分界线的谈判继续进行的事实，和西方阵营授意发出的说美国人在这个问题上可能妥协的消息，又使人重新有了这个关键问题可以得到解决的希望。美国人懑怨说如果接受以三八线为分界线，就必须放弃“好不容易赢得的土地”，这是胡说。目前，北朝鲜人在三八线以南在一百四十五公里的一条线上，握有三千六百三十平方公里的土地，美国人则在三八线以北，在一百四十五公里的一条线上占有四千六百三十平方公里土地。如果双方从确定的一条线上撤退十公里，并成立监督小组来监督双方都不集结兵力作新的进攻，那末要有一条可以防守的军事线的要求是可笑的。美方坚执提出这一个要求对于任何最后的和平解决都是有妨害的。北朝鲜人和中国人是把“可防守的一线”这个用词解释为新进攻的“出发点”的。他们对于帝国主义的诡计都有丰富的经验。他们的论点是和平的，以在朝鲜停止军队和平民的屠杀作为谋世界和平的第一步。美国的论点是武力的和继续作战的。三八线是对双方都没有军事好处的一条和平疆界。接受不接受这一点被认为是美国是真正想和平，抑或他们只是想拖延时间以待雨季过去之后发动新攻势的试金石。现在已经发现，昨日大举空袭平壤时，美方不仅像他们现在所承认的因为天气的缘故不得不滥施轰炸，他们而且投下了伪装为儿童玩具和自来水笔的“饵雷”，把去捡这些东西的儿童和别人炸得粉碎。这就是“糖果幕”画片的真相。所谓“糖果幕”的画片，就是由几个美国人丢给朝鲜儿童几块糖，让记者摄几张相片，就开城有上百个失学儿童，这里有几个儿童正在争抢美国的糖果。在这些儿童当着这些使他们失去家园，成为孤儿，强奸他们的姐姐、母亲的军队的随军记者面前，把这些糖果丢回给他们的时候，这些记者们就告诉西方世界说，这些儿童是按“军事命令”行事的。
