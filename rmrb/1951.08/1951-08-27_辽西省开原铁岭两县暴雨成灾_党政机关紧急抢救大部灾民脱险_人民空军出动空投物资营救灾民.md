　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th. Recently, Kaiyuan and Tieling counties in Liaoxi Province were hit by a sudden flood disaster, and a section of the Sino-Changchun Railway between the two counties was destroyed. The Northeast People's Government has now taken emergency disaster relief measures, and the People's Air Force has also dispatched aircraft to the disaster area to airdrop supplies and rescue the masses in the disaster area.
    Kaiyuan and Tieling counties in the upper reaches of the Liao River are mountainous areas and rarely suffer from floods. From 9:00 AM on the 13th to 1:00 PM on the 14th of this month, the area was hit by a sudden torrential rain. The rainfall, centered on Kaiyuan, reached 202 millimeters, equivalent to one-third of the local annual rainfall. As a result, mountain torrents broke out, and the water levels of the Qing River and Ma Zhong River, tributaries of the Liao River, rose sharply. Many river embankments were washed away, and a section of the Sino-Changchun Railway was also flooded. Nearly a hundred villages in the two counties were turned into a watery expanse. In some places along the Qing River, the water depth exceeded ten meters. The magnitude of the flood was unprecedented in the area for decades. According to preliminary estimates, tens of thousands of people in the two counties have been affected, and the loss of life and property cannot be estimated at this time.
    After the flood occurred, local county and district cadres immediately went out to rescue the disaster victims. A unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Kaiyuan area also organized more than 50 boats and used car tire inner tubes as lifebuoys to go to the disaster area for rescue operations for several consecutive days. The People's Governments and Communist Party County Committees of Changbei, Changtu, and Faku counties, which are adjacent to the disaster area, also sent cadres leading a large number of people who could swim to the disaster area for rescue. After hearing the news, Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, immediately personally arranged: on the one hand, he dispatched multiple aircraft with many cadres to rush to the disaster area in adverse weather conditions, and airdropped a large number of life-saving equipment and food to the disaster victims. On the other hand, he urgently notified the People's Governments of Xinmin, Liaozhong, Panshan, and Tai'an counties in the lower reaches of the Liao River to strengthen flood prevention and transfer the masses living in low-lying areas to higher ground to prevent flood surges. The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company also dispatched two aircraft from Shenyang to assist the People's Air Force in rescuing disaster victims. In addition, the Northeast People's Government also transferred more than 300 wooden boats and all the sailors from Yingkou and other places to the disaster area for rescue. At present, most of the disaster victims have been rescued. Homeless disaster victims have also been temporarily accommodated in various disaster victim reception centers. Lin Feng, Deputy Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, and Yang Yichen, Chairman of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government, have both personally visited the disaster area to express condolences to the disaster victims.
    At present, although the floodwaters have flowed directly into Liaozhong, Tai'an, Panshan and other counties, and the water head has affected parts of Xinmin, Liaozhong, and the suburbs of Shenyang, the masses in the lower reaches have been prepared in advance. In addition, the rainy season has now passed. As long as it does not continue to rain upstream, the Liao River can safely pass the flood season.

　　辽西省开原铁岭两县暴雨成灾
    党政机关紧急抢救大部灾民脱险
    人民空军出动空投物资营救灾民
    【新华社沈阳二十日电】辽西省开原、铁岭两县最近突遭洪水灾害，两县间的中长铁路被冲毁一段。东北人民政府现已采取紧急救灾措施，人民空军亦出动前往灾区空投物资，营救灾区群众。
    辽河上游的开原、铁岭两县本是山地，向来很少遭受水灾。本月十三日上午九时到十四日下午一时，当地骤降暴雨，暴雨以开原为中心，雨量竟达二百零二公厘，相当于当地全年雨量的三分之一。因此，山洪暴发，辽河支流清河和马仲河的水位骤然猛涨，许多河堤被冲毁，中长铁路亦被淹毁一部分，两县近百个村庄顿成泽国，清河两岸有的地方水深十公尺以上，水势之大是当地数十年来所没有的。据初步了解：两县受灾人数达数万，生命、财产的损失一时尚无法统计。
    水灾发生后，当地县、区干部立即出动抢救灾民。驻开原地区的人民解放军某部，也连日组织了五十多条船，带了汽车轮带的内胎作救生圈，前往灾区抢救。邻近灾区的昌北、昌图、法库等县人民政府和共产党县委会，亦派出干部率领了大批会游泳的人赶到灾区抢救。东北人民政府闻讯后，高岗主席立即亲自部署：一方面派出飞机多架连同干部多人冒着恶劣的气候，赶赴灾区，并空投大批救生器具和食物给灾民。另方面紧急通知辽河下游的新民、辽中、盘山、台安等县人民政府加紧预防洪水，并将居住在洼地的群众转移高地以防洪水冲袭。中苏民用航空公司亦从沈阳派出两架飞机协助人民空军抢救灾民。此外，东北人民政府还从营口等地调动了三百多只木船和全部水手，驰往灾区抢救。现在，大部分灾民都已脱险。无家可归的灾民，也已安置到各灾民招待所暂住。东北人民政府林枫副主席及辽西省人民政府杨易辰主席均曾亲往灾区慰问灾民。
    目前，洪水水势虽已直泄辽中、台安、盘山等县，水头并已波及新民、辽中和沈阳市郊的部分地区，但下游群众已早有准备，加之目前雨季已过，只要上游不再继续降雨，辽河可安全度过汛期。
