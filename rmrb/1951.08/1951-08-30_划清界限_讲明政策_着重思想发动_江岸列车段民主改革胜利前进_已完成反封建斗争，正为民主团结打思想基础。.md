　　Clearly Define Boundaries, Explain Policies, Focus on Ideological Mobilization
    Jiang'an Train Section Advances Victoriously in Democratic Reform
    Having Completed the Anti-Feudal Struggle, Laying the Ideological Foundation for Democratic Unity.
    In carrying out the democratic reform movement, the Jiang'an Train Section of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration's Hankou Branch paid attention to ideologically mobilizing the worker masses, thus ensuring the movement's victory and strengthening the connection between the Communist Party branch, the trade union, and the worker masses. Internal unity among the staff has been further strengthened. Now, many workers are requesting that the CCP branch of the section allow them to attend Party lectures. To strengthen political study, the workers automatically extended the daily study time during their rotating holidays by one hour. Train conductor Xiong Chuanxi, who previously believed that he relied solely on his skills and was unwilling to participate in political activities, voluntarily signed up for the volunteer aid-Korea transportation team after the democratic reform movement.
    The democratic reform movement in this section is being conducted under the unified leadership of the Democratic Reform Committee. This committee is formed with the CCP branch as its core. In the early stages of the movement, some workers confused the opposition to feudal remnants with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and some feared that they would be retaliated against if they failed to overthrow the feudal remnants. The Democratic Reform Committee, in response to these ideological issues, vigorously carried out propaganda and education work. In addition to holding meetings to report on democratic reform issues to the worker masses, the committee also organized all propagandists to conduct visits to the suffering and establish connections, cultivating the backbone force for the anti-feudal struggle. At the same time, various propaganda methods were used to widely publicize the evil deeds of feudal remnants to the worker masses, delineate the boundaries between ourselves and the enemy, explain the policy of treating different situations differently, and organize the worker masses for repeated discussions. Through this propaganda and education, the worker masses understood the policies, and more than 80 percent of the workers in the entire section united around the Democratic Reform Committee. The struggle against feudal remnants then unfolded enthusiastically.
    However, at this time, some workers with a poor past work style and those who had been conductors before liberation still had concerns. They feared that the worker masses would regard them as targets of the struggle. The Democratic Reform Committee of the section took Wu Shanhe, a feudal remnant exposed by the freight department, as an example. The committee depicted Wu Shanhe's crimes of raping women, beating and scolding workers, and organizing gangs in cartoons, organized each group to discuss them, and examined whether there were people like Wu Shanhe in the section. This kind of propaganda explanation with concrete examples greatly helped the workers to draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves. Some workers who had been drawn in and deceived by feudal remnants successively stood on the side of the worker masses. For example, before the struggle against feudal remnant Hu Jiayu, seven workers in the transportation department who had participated in Hu Jiayu's feudal clique voluntarily reflected to the Democratic Reform Committee materials about Hu Jiayu's attempts to provoke relations between the administrative side and the trade union and came forward to testify at the reasoned struggle meeting. Wang Chaoshan, a worker who had been close to feudal remnant Dong Guocai, also voluntarily wrote a self-criticism and handed over to the Democratic Reform Committee a letter from Dong Guocai attempting to undermine the anti-feudal struggle.
    During the movement, the Democratic Reform Committee also led the workers to discuss how to handle each feudal remnant based on their specific circumstances. For example, when struggling against feudal remnant Dong Guocai, some workers requested that he be sent to the Public Security Bureau. After the Democratic Reform Committee led the worker masses in discussion, it was decided to keep him in the section under the control of the worker masses, which educated the worker masses on policy.
    Currently, the anti-feudal struggle in this section has been successfully completed. The Democratic Reform Committee is leading the workers in a mass summary to further raise the political awareness of the worker masses and lay a solid ideological foundation for the next step of democratic unity.

### 划清界限·讲明政策·着重思想发动  江岸列车段民主改革胜利前进  已完成反封建斗争，正为民主团结打思想基础。

　　划清界限·讲明政策·着重思想发动
    江岸列车段民主改革胜利前进
    已完成反封建斗争，正为民主团结打思想基础。
    郑州铁路管理局汉口分局江岸列车段在开展民主改革运动中，注意从思想上发动工人群众，因而使运动得到胜利，共产党支部、工会和工人群众的联系也更加密切起来，职工内部团结已更加强。现在许多工人纷纷要求该段中共支部允许他们听党课。为了加强政治学习，工人们自动把轮流休假期间每天学习时间延长了一小时。运转车长熊传熙，过去认为自己只凭技术吃饭，不愿参加政治活动，在民主改革运动后，自动报名参加了志愿援朝运输队。
    该段民主改革运动是由民主改革委员会统一领导进行的。这个委员会以中共支部为核心而组成。在运动初期，部分工人把反对封建残余分子和镇压反革命分子混淆起来，有些人害怕斗不倒封建残余分子反会遭到报复。民主改革委员会针对这些思想情况，大力开展宣传教育工作。该委员会除召开会议向工人群众作关于民主改革问题的报告外，还组织全体宣传员进行访苦、串连，培养反封建斗争的骨干力量。同时运用各种宣传方式，向工人群众广泛宣传封建残余分子的恶迹，划分敌我界限，说明分别情况分别对待的政策，并组织工人群众反复讨论。经过这些宣传教育，工人群众认识了政策，全段百分之八十以上的工人都团结在民主改革委员会周围。反封建残余分子的斗争随即热烈展开。
    但这时有些过去作风不好的工人和解放前即任车长的人仍有顾虑，他们怕工人群众把自己当成斗争对象。该段民主改革委员会就把货运部门检举出来的封建残余分子吴善和作为例子，把吴善和强奸妇女、打骂工人、组织帮派的罪恶事实用漫画表现出来，组织各小组进行讨论，检查本段内是否还有像吴善和那样的人。这种以具体事例为内容的宣传解释，对工人们划清敌我界限帮助很大，部分曾受封建残余分子拉拢、欺骗的工人，纷纷站到工人群众方面来。例如斗争封建残余分子胡家玉前，运转部门就有七个过去参加过胡家玉封建集团的工人，主动向民主改革委员会反映了胡家玉挑拨行政方面和工会关系的材料，并在说理斗争会上出来作证。过去和封建残余分子董国材靠近的工人王超山，也自动写检讨书，并把董国材企图破坏反封建斗争的信件交给民主改革委员会。
    在运动中，民主改革委员会还领导工人根据各封建残余分子的具体情况，讨论如何分别处理的办法。例如斗争封建残余分子董国材时，部分工人曾要求把他送到公安局去。经民主改革委员会领导工人群众讨论，决定留在本段内由工人群众加以管制，这就在政策上教育了工人群众。
    目前，该段反封建斗争已胜利完成，民主改革委员会正领导工人进行群众性的总结，以进一步提高工人群众的政治觉悟，并为下一步的民主团结工作打好思想基础。
