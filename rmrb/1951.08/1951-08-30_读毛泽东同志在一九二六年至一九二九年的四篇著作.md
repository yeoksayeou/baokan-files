　　Reading Comrade Mao Zedong's Four Works from 1926 to 1929

    I.

    The history of the Communist Party of China is a history of leading the working class and the broad masses of people in the struggle for liberation, a history of the victorious combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and a history of the formation, development, and guiding role of Mao Zedong Thought in winning every battle.

    As early as the initial stage of the revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong's various important papers demonstrated his mastery of Marxism-Leninism and his revolutionary genius. As is well known, the Second National Congress of the Party in 1922 had already declared that the Chinese revolution was a democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism. The Third National Congress of the Party in 1923 decided to cooperate with the Kuomintang to carry out the National Revolution. Due to the realization of the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and the establishment of the revolutionary united front, the Great Revolution of 1924-1927 broke out. However, which class was the leader of this united front? Was it the working class or the bourgeoisie? Were the allies of the working class the peasantry or the bourgeoisie? Was the democratic revolutionary regime a worker-peasant democratic regime or a bourgeois regime? Was it necessary to arm the workers and peasants to prevent the collapse of the front and rear, and to prevent betrayal and defection, as a guarantee of victory for this revolution? The right-leaning opportunist Chen Duxiu faction, the leader of the Party at the time, completely failed to consider these fundamental questions of the revolution. They believed that the democratic revolution at that time should be led by the bourgeoisie, "all work should be attributed to the Kuomintang," and "after the success of the democratic revolution, the proletariat would only gain some freedom and rights." Therefore, they recognized the bourgeoisie as the leader of the united front at that time, recognized that the future of the revolution was a bourgeois republic, they ignored the peasant question, and accepted the demands of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, ordering Communist Party members to withdraw from the army. At the same time, left-leaning opportunists such as Zhang Guotao only paid attention to the workers' movement and forgot about the peasants. Such a situation had long foreshadowed the dangers of the revolution.

    Thus, at the first critical moment of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong first published his immortal masterpiece "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" in March 1926. The purpose of this work was to solve the primary problem of the revolution, namely, to distinguish the enemies of the revolution from the friends of the revolution, and to solve the problem of the revolutionary united front. It used the Marxist-Leninist class theory to specifically analyze the various classes in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal Chinese society. Comrade Mao Zedong's paper pointed out that the Chinese bourgeoisie was different from the bourgeoisie in capitalist countries. The Chinese bourgeoisie had two different types, one was the comprador class, and the other was the middle class, that is, the national bourgeoisie. The comprador class was the agent of imperialism in China, and together with the landlord class, it was a vassal of imperialism, both representing reactionary relations of production. The middle class, that is, the national bourgeoisie, had both revolutionary and compromising aspects. This class held the idea of carrying out the revolution "independently" with its own class as the main body in order to establish a bourgeois state, but in the era of the world proletarian socialist revolution, this idea was only a fantasy. That is to say, in the era of imperialism and the world proletarian revolution, the national bourgeoisie in semi-colonial countries could never lead the democratic revolution to victory. Comrade Mao Zedong's incisive thesis was a living application of Marxism-Leninism in the specific environment of China. In the Chinese revolutionary camp at that time in 1926, this was a great insight. Because most of the people who analyzed the class composition of Chinese society at that time adopted the formula of analyzing the democratic revolution in 18th-century Europe and confirmed that the Chinese bourgeoisie had the ability to lead the democratic revolution, but they did not know the weakness and duplicity of the bourgeoisie in semi-colonial countries ruled by imperialism. Comrade Mao Zedong's paper also analyzed the petty bourgeoisie, pointing out that the left, middle, and right factions within it had different attitudes towards the revolution due to their different economic status, but in general, they could all become friends of the revolution. In particular, the semi-proletariat, including most of the poor peasant class, could become a broad ally of the revolution. As for the proletariat, because it suffered the triple oppression and exploitation of the bourgeoisie, feudalism, and imperialism, it was the most revolutionary and progressive class, and in the revolutionary struggles over the years, it had been the leading force of the revolution. This was proven by the large-scale strike movements held in various places between 1922 and 1926.

    Based on the above analysis, it is possible to identify who are our enemies and who are our friends, and thus to unite our true friends and attack our true enemies. Comrade Mao Zedong concluded: "In summary, it can be seen that all warlords, bureaucrats, comprador classes, big landlord classes, and a part of the reactionary intellectuals attached to them who collude with imperialism are our enemies. The industrial proletariat is the leading force of our revolution, and all semi-proletarians and petty bourgeoisies are our closest friends. The vacillating middle class, its right wing may be our enemies, and its left wing may be our friends—but we must always be vigilant against them and not let them disrupt our front." This is a completely correct conclusion.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist analysis of the various classes in Chinese society laid the most fundamental line for the Chinese revolution, that is, the revolutionary united front led by the working class, uniting the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. Comrade Mao Zedong's great work, from the point of view of combining the Marxist-Leninist class theory with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, developed the Marxist-Leninist class theory. Because during the Chinese revolution in 1926, most people did not understand that the class composition and class relations in semi-feudal and semi-colonial countries were completely different from the class composition and class relations in general capitalist countries, and they could not analyze the class relations in China at that time, but could only mechanically and dogmatically copy the experiences or formulas of other countries, thus making left and right leaning opportunist mistakes. Only Comrade Mao Zedong had such great insight at an early age and made such an incisive analysis.

  II.

    Comrade Mao Zedong recognized that in the revolutionary united front led by the working class, the peasant class was the most important ally of the working class. During his early revolutionary activities, he noticed that the peasant question was the central question of the Chinese revolution. In the Chinese language class of the "Remedial Class" of the Self-Study University in 1923, he specifically lectured on articles on the peasant question written based on the situation in Hunan, pointing out that the only way out for the peasants was to take back the land from the landlords. In the spring of 1925, he returned to his hometown of Shaoshan Village in Hunan from Shanghai, stayed for a short time, recuperated, and actually engaged in the peasant movement. Later, he went to Guangzhou to host the "Peasant Movement Training Institute," explained "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" to the trainees and working cadres to carry out class education and guide the cadres' thinking and actions. At the same time, he collected a wealth of information related to the peasant movement. From the second half of 1926, the peasant movement in Hunan developed extremely rapidly, and a vigorous rural revolution broke out. The Kuomintang rightists were extremely opposed to this rural revolutionary movement, and the Kuomintang leftists also expressed dissatisfaction; even some communists such as Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao also thought it was "excessive." In order to support this peasant revolutionary movement, Comrade Mao Zedong published "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" in March 1927, pointing out that the views of those inside and outside the Party who opposed the peasant revolutionary movement were counter-revolutionary. This work emphasized that the rural revolutionary movement "is the broad masses of peasants rising up to complete their historical mission, and it is the rural democratic forces rising up to overthrow the rural feudal forces. The patriarchal feudal local tyrants and evil gentry and the illegal landlord class are the foundation of thousands of years of autocratic politics, and the foundation of imperialism, warlords, and corrupt officials. Overthrowing this feudal force is the true goal of the National Revolution." At that time, the Kuomintang people opposed the anti-feudal rural revolution, which meant opposing the revolution; the Communist Chen Duxiu faction was afraid that the peasants' involvement in the revolution would destroy the united front, which meant surrendering to the Kuomintang reactionaries. Comrade Mao Zedong's report was also a roar within the Communist Party at the time. Unfortunately, this roar did not awaken the Chen Duxiu faction's opportunist group, and it failed to save the crisis of the revolution at that time.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's report established the theoretical foundation of the worker-peasant alliance and determined the relationship between the Party and the peasants. The peasants, who accounted for 80 percent of the country's population, were the broadest ally of the revolution. Later land revolution policies, Red Army warfare, and other policies for rural base areas were outlined in this report. The report pointed out that the poor peasants, who accounted for 70 percent of the rural population, were the pillar of the rural regime and the leaders of the rural revolution; the middle peasants, who accounted for 20 percent, could be united into the peasant associations; and the rich peasants, who accounted for a few percent, could maintain neutrality even though their attitude was vacillating. In this way, the strategic thinking of relying on and mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, uniting the middle peasants, neutralizing the rich peasants, and eliminating the landlords' anti-feudal struggle was established at this time. The report pointed out that the steps of the rural revolution in Hunan were: the peasants first formed peasant associations, then used the power of the masses to politically attack the landlords, then economically attack the landlords, then overthrow the landlord regime, and all power belonged to the peasant associations. At the same time, the peasants overthrew the landlords' armed forces and established peasant armed forces to protect the peasant regime, and attacked various patriarchal ideas, systems, and bad habits in the countryside, and carried out cultural movements. The process of the peasant revolution at that time provided good experience for the later land revolution. In particular, peasant armed forces and rural regimes were the most important organs in the rural revolution. Without peasant armed forces, peasant regimes could not be guaranteed, and without peasant regimes, rural revolutions could not be promoted. This was proven by the experience at that time. This valuable experience gave a good inspiration to the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, and the Red Army war and the various policies of the rural base areas started from here.

    "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" are both the Bolshevik line of the Communist Party of China during the Great Revolution. They are the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and are important documents that openly oppose the erroneous thoughts of the right-leaning opportunist Chen Duxiu faction and the left-leaning opportunist Zhang Guotao, etc. Although this Bolshevik line was rejected and not adopted by the Chen Duxiu opportunist leadership group at that time, thus leading to the failure of the revolution, it became the basic content of Mao Zedong Thought and the guiding ideology of the Chinese revolution later.

  III.

    Another main reason for the failure of the revolution in 1927 was the failure to understand the extreme importance of armed struggle in China, the failure to earnestly prepare for war and organize the army, and the failure to pay attention to the study of military strategy and tactics. In the process of the Northern Expedition, the work of the army was neglected and one-sidedly focused on the mass movement. As a result, once the Kuomintang reacted, all mass movements collapsed. Comrade Mao Zedong summed up the experience of the Great Revolution and pointed out the truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." He believed that the people's revolution in semi-colonial and semi-feudal countries was different from the proletarian revolution in capitalist countries. In China, there was no democratic system internally, but it was oppressed by the feudal system; there was no national independence externally, but it was oppressed by imperialism. Therefore, the main form of struggle for the people was war, and the main form of organization was the army. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang betrayed the revolution, the Chinese Communist Party could only open the road to revolution by leading the people to carry out armed struggle and establish a red regime. After the August 7th Meeting, Comrade Mao Zedong went to the area of western Jiangxi and eastern Hunan to lead the workers, peasants, and a part of the Northern Expedition Army in uprisings, established the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army, established the Xianggan Border Region Workers' and Peasants' Government in the Jinggang Mountains area, and began the land revolution. Later, it joined forces with the Nanchang Uprising troops to form the Fourth Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. During the same period, in leading guerrilla warfare and land struggles in Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, and other places, the Party successively established several Red Army units and several revolutionary base areas. The establishment of these red armies and red regimes reorganized the revolutionary ranks, threatened the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and maintained the hopes of the revolutionary people throughout the country.

    The several Red Army units and the several small red regimes were indeed very small at a time when the reactionary armed forces were very large, but they were a newborn force that was bound to grow and become strong. Although the white reactionary armed forces were large, they were a corrupt force that was bound to decline. This is the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. However, some comrades in the Party at that time doubted whether the red regime could exist for a long time. Therefore, on October 5, 1928, Comrade Mao Zedong published the important work "Why Is It That Red Political Power Can Exist in China?" to strengthen the confidence of comrades. This work pointed out five conditions for the existence of the red regime. First, the local agricultural economy and the imperialist policy of dividing spheres of influence and exploitation made the old and new warlords who colluded with imperialism fight each other. The long-term division and war between the white regimes gave the revolutionary forces an opportunity to enable the red regime to persist in the encirclement of the white regimes and to develop. Second, the areas where the red regime existed, such as Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Guangdong, were all affected by the democratic revolution by workers, peasants, and soldiers. They had organized trade unions and peasant associations and had carried out political and economic struggles against the landlords and bourgeoisie, so they could support the red regime. Third, the continued development of the national revolutionary situation can enable the red regime to exist for a long time. Fourth, the existence and development of the Red Army can guarantee the red regime. Fifth, the strength of the Communist Party organization and the correctness of its policies can guarantee the existence and development of the red regime.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's incisive analysis and argument were completely based on the specific actual conditions of China at that time, and from the contradictions, from the development, and comprehensively, he obtained a genius and unique conclusion. Such a conclusion can also be said to be such a scientific prediction, which is the result of mastering and applying dialectical materialism. It was by relying on Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific thought and foresight that the Chinese revolution recovered and developed after the failure of the First Domestic Revolutionary War, and thus created such a great victory today.

    Marx and Engels concluded under the capitalist conditions before imperialism that the socialist revolution could not be won in one country alone, and it could only be won under the condition of simultaneous revolution in all or most civilized countries. In the age of imperialism, capitalism had changed from ascending to dying. At this time, Lenin discovered the law of unbalanced economic and political development of capitalist countries, and as a result, military conflicts between imperialist countries became absolutely inevitable, thus obtaining the genius conclusion that socialism could first be won in one country. Due to this discovery, Lenin enriched Marxism with new theories, developed Marxism, and used this theory to guide the Russian revolution and establish the first socialist country in the world.

    Just as the Soviet October Revolution broke through the weakest link in the chain of the imperialist front and won the victory, and established the Soviet regime in its law of unbalanced development; the Chinese people's revolution, "because of the long-term division and war between the white regimes," also "enabled a small or several small red areas led by the Communist Party to occur and persist in the midst of the encirclement of the surrounding white regimes." At the same time, just as the existence of the Soviet Union was a beacon for the people of the world, the existence of the red regime was a beacon for the Chinese people's revolution that year. With it, the broad masses of people in the white areas could respond to the call of the red regime at any time, intensify their struggle, and expand the revolutionary forces. With it, the Chinese people could organically and flexibly coordinate armed struggle, the main form of struggle, with other necessary forms of struggle, directly or indirectly, throughout the country.

    Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on armed struggle and revolutionary base areas in the Chinese revolution is one of the main contents of Mao Zedong Thought. This theory is based on the specific conditions of China and has enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism.

  IV.

    One of the conditions for the existence of the red regime is "the strength of the Communist Party organization and the correctness of its policies." "If we want to defeat the enemy, our ranks must be neat and our steps must be consistent. The soldiers must be elite and the weapons must be good. If these conditions are not met, the enemy will not be defeated by us." When the red regime had been consolidated and was fighting the powerful enemy Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the issue of the Bolshevikization of the Party was put on the agenda. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the experience of Party building during the First Domestic Revolutionary War, and in view of the deviations within the Party at that time, wrote the "Resolution on Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" in December 1929. The basic spirit of this resolution was to put the Party on the road of Bolshevikization, and its contents can be summarized into the following four items:

    1. Establish Party discipline. It is stipulated that the Red Army is an armed group that performs revolutionary political tasks and must be led by the Party. The purely military point of view must be corrected. Democratic centralism is the organizational principle of the Party, and deviations such as extreme democratization, absolute egalitarianism, unorganized views, individualism, and sectarianism must be corrected.

    2. An unified understanding of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. Educate Party members to use Marxist-Leninist methods to analyze the political situation and estimate class forces, so as to replace subjective analysis and estimation; make Party members pay attention to the investigation and research of social economy, so as to determine the strategy of struggle and the method of work. Subjectivism and the opportunism and blind actionism it produces must be overcome.

    3. The Party must be good at using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to consolidate the Party organization and enhance the Party's combat power. However, criticism and self-criticism should prevent subjective arbitrariness and vulgarization, and speaking should be based on evidence, and criticism should be political.

    4. Link with the masses. The Red Army must bear the important tasks of publicizing the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses establish political power, and even establishing the Communist Party organization, and avoid the crisis of being divorced from the masses and divorced from the leadership of the proletariat.

    In general, the proletarian political party—the Communist Party—must become "a party with discipline, armed with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, adopting the method of criticism and self-criticism, and linking with the masses of the people." Only in this way can it lead the broad masses of people to win the revolution.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's work occupies an extremely important position in the construction of the Party. It thoroughly exposed the serious errors of various non-proletarian ideas that existed in the Party at that time, clearly demonstrated the harm of those ideas to the revolutionary cause, and further proposed ways to correct them; it raised the theory of Party leadership to the height it should be; it laid a good foundation for the Party's correct thinking; and its principles naturally developed into the ideological system of the Bolshevikization of the Party.

    Lenin, in his famous book "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back," that is, in expounding the theory of the Party for the first time in the history of Marxism, once said: "The proletariat can become and will inevitably become an invincible force only because its ideological unity caused by Marxist principles, and organized material unity consolidate it, and this organization unites millions of workers into the great army of the working class." When Comrade Mao Zedong discovered various harmful ideas in the Party in those years, he immediately put forward the "Resolution on Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" and corrected them. This is a powerful expression of Lenin's idea of Party building. In the literature of Party building in China, this work by Comrade Mao Zedong has primary and special historical significance.

    The four works published by Comrade Mao Zedong from 1926 to 1929, "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," "Why Is It That Red Political Power Can Exist in China?" and "Resolution on Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," are undoubtedly immortal documents of the Chinese people's revolution. From these four documents, we can clearly see that in the revolutionary year, Mao Zedong Thought was gradually formed in continuous victory. Obviously, "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" established the theory of the revolutionary united front led by the working class. "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" determined that the peasant class is the most reliable and broadest ally of the Chinese working class, and established the theoretical foundation of the worker-peasant alliance. "Why Is It That Red Political Power Can Exist in China?" explained that the Chinese people's revolution in semi-colonial and semi-feudal countries can only fight for national and social liberation by carrying out armed struggle; it pointed out that armed revolution can only first establish worker-peasant political power and revolutionary base areas in rural areas, and then seize the cities occupied by counter-revolution. "Resolution on Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" pointed out the direction of the Bolshevikization of the Party. The united front, armed struggle, and Party building are the three magic weapons for the Communist Party of China to defeat the enemy in the Chinese revolution, the three main magic weapons. And these three main magic weapons are the great crystallization of Mao Zedong Thought. The four documents published by Comrade Mao Zedong in his early years have laid the foundation for these three important issues.

    Regarding the basic problems of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Stalin gave many important instructions in 1926 and 1927. He condemned the left-leaning opportunism of the Trotskyites, and according to Leninism, considering the national characteristics and national particularities of China, considering the national characteristics of China's economy, China's political system, China's culture, China's morality, and China's traditions, he analyzed the situation of the Chinese revolution at that time, and pointed out that the Chinese revolution was a democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism, and the leader of this revolution must be the proletariat, not the bourgeoisie, because the national bourgeoisie of semi-colonial China was weak. He believed that the broadest ally of this revolution was the peasant class, and advocated that the rural revolution should be carried out boldly. The faster and more thoroughly the peasants were involved in the revolution, the stronger and more powerful the anti-imperialist united front in China would be. Therefore, he advocated solving the land problem for the peasants. He emphatically pointed out the special significance of the revolutionary army in China, saying that the characteristics and advantages of the Chinese revolution were armed revolution against armed counter-revolution. Therefore, he advocated that the Chinese Communists should pay special attention to the work in the army and occupy leading positions in the revolutionary army to ensure the advance of the revolution. As for the nature of the future regime in China, he believed that it was a regime similar to the worker-peasant democratic dictatorship mainly aimed at anti-imperialism, which would be a transitional regime toward socialism. Comrade Stalin's important instructions, in summary, were: the Chinese revolution is a democratic revolution led by the working class, uniting the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie against imperialism and feudalism. This revolution should use armed revolution against armed counter-revolution to establish a transitional regime going towards socialism. These instructions were 100 percent correct (as proven by the practice of the Chinese revolution later). At that time, the Chen Duxiu faction's opportunist leadership group could not and would not implement Stalin's instructions, and finally led to the failure of the Great Revolution.

    As Chen Boda said in his article "Stalin and the Chinese Revolution," Stalin's various documents on guiding the Chinese revolution in 1926-27, had been deliberately or unintentionally hindered from spreading within the Chinese Party for a long time, that is, before 1927 and for a period after that. Also because of the conditions of the text and the isolation of the counter-revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong and many other comrades could not systematically read Stalin's works. "But despite this, on many fundamental issues, Comrade Mao Zedong was able to reach the same conclusions as Stalin through his own independent thinking based on the revolutionary basic science of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, thus maintaining the correctness of himself and his comrades." This is enough to show Comrade Mao Zedong's profound mastery of Marxism-Leninism and his great revolutionary genius.

　　读毛泽东同志在一九二六年至一九二九年的四篇著作
           李达
    一
    中国共产党的历史，是领导工人阶级和广大人民争取解放斗争的历史，是马列主义普遍真理与中国革命具体实践相结合而取得胜利的历史，是毛泽东思想的形成、发展及其指导革命百战百胜的历史。
    早在革命初期，毛泽东同志所发表的各种重要论文，就表现了他的马克思列宁主义的造诣和革命的天才。如所周知，一九二二年党的第二次代表大会，已经宣言中国革命是反帝国主义反封建主义的民主革命；一九二三年党的第三次代表大会，决定与国民党合作，实行国民革命。由于国共合作的实现，革命的统一战线的成立，因而爆发了一九二四年至一九二七年的大革命。但是这个统一战线的领导者是那一个阶级？是工人阶级还是资产阶级？工人阶级的同盟军是农民阶级还是资产阶级？民主革命政权是工农民主政权还是资产阶级政权？这一革命胜利的保障，是否需要武装工农群众来预防前线和后方的溃散，预防叛变和倒戈？这些革命的基本问题，在当时党的领导者右倾机会主义陈独秀派，是完全没有想到的。他们认为当时的民主革命应该由资产阶级来领导，“一切工作归国民党”，“民主革命成功了，无产阶级不过得着一些自由与权利”。因此他们承认资产阶级是当时统一战线的领导者，承认革命的前途是资产阶级共和国，他们忽视农民问题，并且接受了蒋介石匪帮的要求，命令共产党员退出了军队。同时左倾机会主义者张国焘等，也只注意工人运动，忘记了农民。像这样的形势，早就预伏了革命的危险。
    这样，在中国革命的第一个紧要关头，毛泽东同志在一九二六年三月首先发表了他的不朽杰作《中国社会各阶级的分析》。这一著作的目的，是在于解决革命的首要问题，即分辨革命的敌人和革命的朋友，解决革命统一战线的问题。它运用马列主义的阶级论，具体地分析半殖民地半封建的中国社会的各阶级。毛泽东同志的论文指出中国的资产阶级是与资本主义国家的资产阶级不同的。中国的资产阶级有两种不同的类型，一是买办阶级，一是中产阶级即民族资产阶级。买办阶级是帝国主义在中国的代理人，它和地主阶级同是帝国主义的附庸，都代表着反动的生产关系。中产阶级即民族资产阶级，则具有革命性与妥协性的两面性，这一阶级抱着以其本阶级为主体“独立”进行革命，以建立资产阶级国家的思想，但在世界无产阶级社会主义革命的时代，这种思想，只是一个幻想。这就是说，在帝国主义与无产阶级世界革命的时代，半殖民地的民族资产阶级决不能领导民主革命取得胜利。毛泽东同志这一精辟论断，是马克思列宁主义在中国的具体环境中的活的运用。在一九二六年的当时中国革命阵营中，这是一个伟大的卓见。因为当时分析中国社会阶级构成的人们，大都采用分析十八世纪欧洲的民主主义革命的公式，而确认中国资产阶级有领导民主革命的能力，却不知道帝国主义统治着的半殖民地的资产阶级的软弱性和两面性。毛泽东同志的论文又分析小资产阶级，指出其中的左、中、右三派，因其经济地位不同，决定了他们对于革命的态度也各有不同，但大体上都可能成为革命的朋友。特别是半无产阶级，包括了大多数贫农阶层，能成为革命的广大的同盟军。至于无产阶级，因为身受着资产阶级、封建主义和帝国主义三重的压迫和剥削，是最富于革命彻底性的进步的阶级，在历年的革命斗争中，做了革命的领导力量。这是在一九二二年到一九二六年间在各地举行的大罢工运动所证明了的。
    基于上述的分析，就可以辨别谁是我们的敌人、谁是我们的朋友，因而就能团结我们真正的朋友，去攻击我们真正的敌人。毛泽东同志的结论说：“综上所述，可知一切勾结帝国主义的军阀、官僚、买办阶级、大地主阶级以及附属于他们的一部分反动知识界，是我们的敌人。工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量，一切半无产阶级、小资产阶级是我们最接近的朋友。那动摇不定的中产阶级，其右翼可能是我们的敌人，其左翼可能是我们的朋友—但我们要时常提防他们，不要让他们扰乱了我们的阵线。”这是完全正确的论断。
    毛泽东同志对中国社会各阶级作了马克思列宁主义的分析，就奠定了中国革命的最根本的路线，即工人阶级领导农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级的革命的统一战线。毛泽东同志这一伟大著作，就马列主义阶级理论与中国革命具体实践相结合的一点看来，是发展了马列主义的阶级理论的。因为在一九二六年中国革命时期，一般人都不懂得半封建半殖民地的国家阶级构成与阶级诸关系，绝不同于一般资本主义国家的阶级构成与阶级诸关系，他们完全不会分析当时中国阶级诸关系，而仅能生硬地教条式地搬弄他国的经验或公式，因而发生左右倾机会主义的错误。独有毛泽东同志早年就具有这样伟大的卓见，做了这样精辟的分析。

    毛泽东同志认定，在工人阶级领导的革命统一战线中，农民阶级是工人阶级的最主要的同盟军。他在早期革命活动时，就注意到农民问题是中国革命的中心问题。他在一九二三年自修大学的“补习班”的国文课中，特别讲授了依据湖南情况写成的农民问题的文章，指出农民的出路只有从地主手中夺回土地。一九二五年春季，他从上海回到故乡湖南韶山村，住了一个短的时候，一面养病，一面实际从事农民运动。以后他到广州主办“农民运动讲习所”，对受训的工作干部讲解“中国社会各阶级的分析”，来进行阶级教育，指导干部的思想和行动。同时他搜集了与农民运动有关的丰富的资料。从一九二六年下期起，湖南农民运动发展得异常迅速，爆发了轰轰烈烈的农村大革命。对于这一农村革命运动，国民党右派是极力反对的，国民党左派也表示不满；甚至一部分共产党人如陈独秀、张国焘等也认为“过火”。毛泽东同志为了支持这一农民革命运动，于一九二七年三月发表了《湖南农民运动考察报告》，指出党内外反对农民革命运动的见解是反革命的。这一著作着重指出：农村革命运动“乃是广大的农民群众起来完成他们的历史使命，乃是乡村的民主势力起来打翻乡村的封建势力。宗法封建性的土豪劣绅、不法地主阶级，是几千年专制政治的基础，帝国主义、军阀、贪官污吏的墙脚。打翻这个封建势力，乃是国民革命的真正目标。”当时国民党人反对反封建主义的农村革命，就是反对革命；共产党人陈独秀派害怕农民卷入革命会破坏统一战线，就是向国民党反动派投降。毛泽东同志这一报告，在当时的共产党内部也是一声怒吼，可惜这一声怒吼，不曾惊醒陈独秀派的机会主义集团，终于没有挽救当时革命的危机。
    毛泽东同志这一报告，建立了工农联盟的理论基础，确定了党与农民的关系。占全国人口百分之八十的农民，是革命的最广大的同盟军。后来的土地革命政策、红军战争和农村根据地的其他各种政策，在这一报告中都已经提出了一个轮廓。报告指出，占农村人口百分之七十的贫农，是农村政权的支柱，是农村革命的领导；占百分之二十的中农，可以团结到农会中来；占百分之几的富农虽然态度游移，却可以保持中立。像这样，依靠并发动贫雇农，团结中农，中立富农，消灭地主的反封建斗争的策略思想，早在这时候树立了。报告指出，湖南农村革命的步骤是：农民们首先组成农会，接着用大众的力量，从政治上打击地主，然后从经济上打击地主，于是推翻地主政权，一切权力归农会，同时推翻地主武装，建立农民武装，来保障农民政权，并攻击各种宗法的思想、制度和乡村的恶劣习惯，开展文化运动。当时农民革命的过程，为后来的土地革命，提供了良好的经验。特别是农民武装和农村政权，在农村革命中是最重要的机关，没有农民武装不能保障农民政权，没有农民政权不能推行农村革命，这是当时的经验所证明了的。这一宝贵的经验，对第二次国内革命战争，给了很好的启示，红军战争和农村根据地的各项政策，就是从这里出发的。
    《中国社会各阶级的分析》和《湖南农民运动考察报告》，同是大革命时期中国共产党的布尔塞维克路线，是马克思列宁主义普遍真理与中国革命具体实践的结合，是公开反对右倾机会主义陈独秀派和左倾机会主义张国焘等的错误思想的重要文献。这一布尔塞维克路线，在当时虽被陈独秀机会主义领导集团所拒绝采纳，因而招致革命的失败，但它却成为毛泽东思想的基本内容，成为后来中国革命的指导思想。

    一九二七年革命的失败，还有一个主要原因，是不懂得武装斗争在中国的极端重要性，不去认真地准备战争与组织军队，不去注重军事的战略战术的研究。在北伐过程中，忽视了军队工作，片面着重于民众运动，其结果，国民党一旦反动，什么民众运动也塌台了。毛泽东同志总结大革命时期的经验，指出了“枪杆子里出政权”的真理。他认为半殖民地半封建国家的人民革命，和资本主义国家的无产阶级革命不同。在中国，对内没有民主制度，而受封建制度压迫；对外没有民族独立，而受帝国主义压迫。所以，人民主要的斗争形式是战争，而主要的组织形式是军队。当蒋介石匪帮背叛革命之时，中国共产党只有领导人民实行武装斗争，建立红色政权，才能打开革命的道路。毛泽东同志在八七会议以后，就到江西西部和湖南东部一带地区，领导两省的工人、农民和北伐军一部分举行了起义，成立了工农革命军，在井冈山区域，建立了湘赣边区工农政府，并开始了土地革命。以后又与南昌起义部队相会合，成立了中国工农红军第四军。在同一时期内，党在领导江西、湖南、湖北、广西等地的游击战争和土地斗争中，陆续成立了几支红军和几处革命根据地。这些红色军队和红色政权的建立，重整了革命阵容，威胁着蒋介石匪帮的统治，维系着全国革命人民的希望。
    几支红军和几个小块的红色政权，在当时反动武力非常庞大的时候，诚然是很微小的，但它是新生的力量，必然要成长壮大起来。白色反动武力虽然庞大，却是腐朽的力量，必然要没落下去。这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。但当时党内一部分同志却怀疑红色政权能够长期存在。因此，毛泽东同志在一九二八年十月五日发表了《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在》的重要著作，坚定同志们的信心。这一著作，指出了红色政权能够存在的五个条件。第一、地方性的农业经济和帝国主义划分势力范围的分裂剥削政策，使得各个勾结帝国主义的新旧军阀之间互相火并。白色政权间的长期分裂和战争，就给革命力量以机会，使红色政权能够在白色政权的包围中坚持下来，并能得到发展。第二、红色政权存在的湖南、江西、湖北、广东等地区，工农士兵都受过民主革命的影响，他们组织过工会和农会，对地主资产阶级做过政治的经济的斗争，所以他们能支持红色政权。第三、全国革命形势继续发展，能使红色政权长期存在。第四、红军的存在和发展，可以保障红色政权。第五、共产党组织的有力量和它的政策的正确，能够保证红色政权的存在和发展。
    毛泽东同志这一精辟的分析和论断，完全是根据当时中国特有的实际情况，从矛盾中，从发展中，综合全面，获得了的一个天才的独特的结论。这样的结论，也可以说是这样的科学预见，正是掌握与运用辩证唯物主义的结果。就是靠了毛泽东同志这样的科学思想和预见，中国革命在第一次国内战争失败以后才获得复苏与发展，以致造成今天这样伟大的胜利。
    马克思和恩格斯在帝国主义以前的资本主义条件下得出结论说：社会主义革命不能单独在一个国家中取得胜利，它只能在一切或者大多数文明国家同时革命的条件下取得胜利。到了帝国主义时代，资本主义已由上升的变为垂死的了，这时，列宁发现了各资本主义国家在经济上政治上不平衡发展的规律，结果使得各帝国主义国家间的军事冲突成为绝对不可避免的事情，因而获得社会主义能够首先在一个国家内取得胜利的天才的结论。由于这一发现，列宁以新的理论丰富了马克思主义，发展了马克思主义，并以这个理论指导俄国的革命，建立了全世界第一个社会主义国家。
    正如苏联十月革命，突破了帝国主义战线炼条最薄弱的地方，取得了胜利，在其不平衡发展规律当中，建立了苏维埃政权一样；中国人民的革命，“因为有了白色政权间的长期的分裂和战争”，也就“使一小块或若干小块的共产党领导的红色区域，能够在四围白色政权包围的中间发生和坚持下来。”同时，正如苏联的存在是全世界人民的灯塔一样，红色政权的存在是当年中国人民革命的灯塔。有了它，处于白色区域的广大人民，就能随时响应红色政权的号召，加紧斗争，扩大革命的势力。有了它，中国人民就能把武装斗争这个主要斗争形式与其他必要的斗争形式，在全国范围内，直接或间接地有机地灵活地配合起来。
    所以，毛泽东同志关于中国革命中的武装斗争和革命根据地的理论是毛泽东思想的主要内容之一。这个理论是根据中国的具体条件而丰富了和发展了马克思列宁主义。

    红色政权能够存在的条件之一，是“共产党组织的有力量和它的政策不错误”。“我们要打倒敌人，我们的队伍就要整齐，我们的脚步就要一致。兵要精，武器要好。如果不具备这些条件，敌人就不会被我们打倒”。当红色政权已经巩固而正在与强大的敌人蒋介石匪帮搏战的时候，党的布尔塞维克化的问题被提上了日程。因此毛泽东同志综合第一次国内战争时期的党的建设的经验，针对当时党内的偏向，在一九二九年十二月写成了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》的决议。这一决议的基本精神，是使党走上布尔塞维克化的道路，其内容可综括为下列四项：
    一、建立党的纪律。规定红军是执行革命的政治任务的武装集团，必须受党的领导。单纯的军事观点必须纠正。民主集中制是党的组织原则，极端民主化、绝对平均主义、非组织观点、个人主义、宗派主义等偏向必须纠正。
    二、马列主义普遍真理与中国革命具体实践之统一的理解。教育党员用马克思列宁主义的方法去作政治形势的分析和阶级力量的估计，以代替主观主义的分析和估计；使党员注意社会经济的调查和研究，由此来决定斗争的策略和工作的方法。主观主义和由它产生的机会主义与盲动主义，必须克服。
    三、党内要善于应用批评和自我批评的武器，巩固党的组织，增强党的战斗力量。但批评和自我批评要防止主观武断和庸俗化，说话要有证据，批评要是政治性的。
    四、联系群众。红军必须负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务，避免脱离群众、脱离无产阶级领导的危机。
    总起来说，无产阶级政党——共产党，必须成为“一个有纪律的有马恩列斯的理论武装的、采取批评与自我批评方法的、联系人民群众的党”，能如是，才能够领导广大人民的革命取得胜利。
    毛泽东同志这一篇著作，在党的建设上，是占着极其重要的地位的。它彻底揭发了那时存在于党内的各种非无产阶级思想的严重错误，明白地论证了那些思想对革命事业的危害，并进而提出纠正的办法；它把党的领导理论提到了应有的高度；它为党的正确思想打下了良好的基础；它的原理，自然而然地后来就发挥成为党的布尔塞维克化的思想体系。
    列宁在其有名的著作《进一步，退两步》一书中，亦即在马克思主义历史中破天荒第一次阐明关于党的学说的时候，就曾经这样说：“无产阶级之能够成为而且必然会成为不可战胜的力量，就只是因为它由马克思主义原则所造成的思想统一，有组织的物质统一把它巩固起来，这个组织把千百万劳动者团结成为工人阶级的大军。”毛泽东同志在当年发觉党内各种有害思想的时候，立刻提出“关于纠正党内的错误思想”的决议而加以纠正，这正是列宁的建党思想的有力发挥。在中国党的建设文献当中，毛泽东同志这一篇著作，是具有首要的特殊的历史意义的。
    毛泽东同志自一九二六年至一九二九年所发表的《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《湖南农民运动考察报告》、《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在》和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》四篇著作，无疑地都是中国人民革命的千古不朽的文献。从这四个文献当中，我们很清晰地可以看到，在革命的当年，毛泽东思想即在不断地胜利中逐渐形成。显然地，《中国社会各阶级的分析》，建立了工人阶级领导的革命的统一战线的理论。《湖南农民运动考察报告》，确定了农民阶级是中国工人阶级最可靠的最广大的同盟军，建立了工农联盟的理论基础。《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在》，说明了半殖民地半封建的中国人民革命，只有进行武装斗争，才能争取民族的与社会的解放；指出了武装革命只有先在农村建立工农政权和革命根据地，然后夺取反革命所占据的都市。《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，指示了党的布尔塞维克化的方针。统一战线、武装斗争、党的建设，是中国共产党在中国革命中战胜敌人的三个法宝，三个主要的法宝。而这三个主要的法宝，也就是毛泽东思想的伟大结晶。毛泽东同志早年发表的这四个文献，已经给这三个方面的重要问题奠定了基础。
    关于中国革命的基本问题，斯大林同志在一九二六和一九二七年，给了很多的重要的指示。他指斥了托洛茨基分子的左倾机会主义，根据列宁主义，考虑到中国民族特点与民族特殊性，考虑到中国经济、中国政治制度、中国文化、中国道德、中国传统的民族特点，分析当时中国革命的形势，指出中国革命是反帝国主义反封建主义的民主革命，而这个革命的领导者必须是无产阶级，而不是资产阶级，因为半殖民地的中国民族资产阶级是软弱的。他认为这一革命的最广大的同盟军是农民阶级，主张放手展开农村革命，农民卷入革命越快越彻底，则中国反帝国主义的统一战线，亦将越强大越有力量。因此他主张为农民解决土地问题。他着重指出革命军队在中国的特殊意义，说中国革命的特点与优点，是武装的革命反对武装的反革命，因而主张中国共产党人应特别注意军队中的工作，要在革命军队中占据领导职位，以保证革命的前进。至于中国未来政权的性质，他认为是类似于工农民主专政以反帝国主义为主的政权，这将是走向社会主义的过渡政权。斯大林同志这些重要的指示，总起来说就是：中国革命是工人阶级领导农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级反帝国主义反封建主义的民主革命，这个革命，要用武装的革命反对武装的反革命，建立走向社会主义去的过渡政权。这些指示，是百分之百正确的（也是后来中国革命的实践所证明了的）。当时陈独秀派机会主义领导集团，不能也不愿执行斯大林的指示，终于招致了大革命的失败。
    斯大林在一九二六——二七年所作的关于指导中国革命的各种文献，如陈伯达同志在《斯大林与中国革命》一文中所说，曾经在很长的时候，即在一九二七年以前及其以后的一个时期，被机会主义者有意或无意地阻碍其在中国党内的传播，又因为文字的条件和反革命的隔离，以致毛泽东同志及其他许多同志不能有系统地阅读斯大林的著作。“但虽然这样，毛泽东同志在许多根本问题上，却能根据马、恩、列、斯的革命基本科学，以自己独立的思考达到了与斯大林相同的结论，因而保持了自己和他的战友们的正确。”这正足以表示毛泽东同志马克思列宁主义的高深的造诣和伟大的革命天才。
