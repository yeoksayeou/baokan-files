Editor's Note: The leading cadres of the Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill have earnestly reviewed their incorrect understanding and practices regarding the formulation of patriotic pledges from an ideological standpoint. As a result, they have begun to correct the tendency of patriotic pledges to detach from actual production work. They have decided to combine patriotic pledges with labor emulation to overcome the formalism of patriotic pledges. This approach is worthy of reference and learning by various regions.

After conducting patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea in April, the Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill, a state-owned enterprise, formulated a mill-wide patriotic pledge. In May, 85% of the mill's workers formulated group patriotic pledges. In early June, most groups revised their patriotic pledges. However, a later inspection of implementation revealed that the actual effect was minimal, and almost all suffered from formalism. A test conducted on 126 workers showed that 66 of them could not remember how many articles the mill-wide patriotic pledge had. Of the ten articles of the patriotic pledge, only 25 people could answer six or more correctly. This indicates that more than five-sixths of the workers had largely forgotten the content of the mill-wide patriotic pledge, and most workers could not even remember their group pledges. This serious situation only attracted the attention of the mill's leadership in early July.

Why did the mill's patriotic pledges suffer from formalism? The main reason is that the leading cadres of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League did not recognize that patriotic pledges are the main driving force for organizing workers to promote patriotic labor emulation. They failed to combine the formulation of patriotic pledges with specific production work and labor emulation. For example, after the mill-wide patriotic pledge was formulated in April, the mill's leadership focused on emulation with the Ma Hengchang Group. In May, they organized workers to study the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group. To improve product quality, they also held a comprehensive exhibition of defective products. However, the mill's leadership did not realize that making the development of emulation and the improvement of product quality the central content of the patriotic pledge. Therefore, the content of the patriotic pledges formulated by various groups was either fragmented and all-encompassing or empty and impossible to inspect. Because the important political significance of the patriotic pledge was not integrated into the current central work, the emulation with the Ma Hengchang Group and the improvement of product quality failed to achieve the desired results. Subsequently, the revision of the patriotic pledge in June was not combined with increased production and donations but instead involved a separate set of donation plans. From late June to early July, a mill-wide security inspection was conducted, detached from the patriotic pledge. Because the central work was completely disconnected from the patriotic pledge, the patriotic pledge was gradually forgotten by everyone.

The General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the Qinghe Woolen Mill seriously examined the above problems in connection with document study. Initially, there were fierce debates among the leading cadres. Some comrades believed that although the mill had not implemented the patriotic pledge well, it had organized workers to study the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, held an exhibition of defective products, and made reports on resisting America and aiding Korea. These were all political work. Why did the People's Daily say that the poor formulation and implementation of the patriotic pledge was a tendency to neglect politics? Later, they realized that this was due to insufficient understanding of the political significance of the patriotic pledge and failure to use the patriotic pledge as a driving force for promoting various tasks.

Some comrades even said, "If neglecting the patriotic pledge is a tendency to neglect political work, then is carrying out the security inspection a mistake?" Later, they realized that this was a view that opposed the patriotic pledge to the central work. The central work such as the security inspection was certainly important, but why couldn't these central tasks be better promoted through the patriotic pledge?

Other comrades believed before the study that they were doing political work and had not neglected the tendency of politics. Later, they realized that they had not grasped the important political work of the patriotic pledge but had only listed many tasks such as A, B, C, and D, and did whatever came up, causing the political work to lose a clear center, which would result in becoming a bureaucratic political worker. After this serious study and examination, the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League leading cadres of the mill realized the political significance of the patriotic pledge and have decided to reformulate the patriotic emulation pledge, combining the patriotic pledge with the increased production plan for the second half of the year, merging the emulation plan with the Ma Hengchang Group and the donation plan into the patriotic emulation pledge. With the patriotic emulation pledge as the center, they will promote various production tasks. After the mill-wide and group patriotic emulation pledges are formulated, they will immediately organize a mill-wide emulation campaign to implement the patriotic emulation pledges.

    北京清河制呢厂
    纠正爱国公约脱离生产工作的偏向
    决定订立爱国竞赛公约展开竞赛
    编者按：北京清河制呢厂的领导干部，认真从思想上检讨了对订立爱国公约的不正确的认识和作法，从而开始纠正爱国公约脱离实际生产工作的偏向，决定把爱国公约和劳动竞赛结合起来，克服爱国公约的形式主义，这种办法，值得各地参考学习。
    北京市公营清河制呢厂四月份进行了抗美援朝爱国教育之后，订立了全厂爱国公约；五月份全厂百分之八十五的职工订立了小组爱国公约；六月上旬，大多数小组修改了爱国公约。但后来检查执行情况，发现实际效果很小，几乎全部犯了形式主义的毛病。此次检查曾测验了一百二十六个工人其中六十六人根本记不得全厂爱国公约有几条，十条爱国公约，答对六条以上的不过二十五人。这说明六分之五以上的职工对全厂爱国公约的内容大部分都忘记了，而且多数职工连小组公约也记不得了。这种严重情况，后来直到七月上旬，才引起该厂领导方面的重视。
    为什么该厂爱国公约犯了形式主义的毛病呢？主要原因是党、政、工、团领导干部，没有认识到爱国公约是组织职工推行爱国劳动竞赛的主要动力，未能把订立爱国公约和具体的生产工作和劳动竞赛结合起来。例如在四月份订立全厂爱国公约后，该厂领导重视了向马恒昌小组竞赛的工作，五月份并组织职工学习马恒昌小组的经验；为了提高产品质量，还举行了内容丰富的废品展览会。但是该厂领导没有意识到把开展竞赛、提高产品质量作为爱国公约的中心内容。因此，各小组所订的爱国公约内容不是零零碎碎样样俱全，就是空空洞洞无法检查。由于没有把爱国公约的重要政治意义贯彻到当前的中心工作中，所以向马恒昌小组竞赛和提高产品质量均未能获得应有的效果。此后，六月份修订爱国公约又没有与增产捐献相结合，而是另搞了一套捐献计划。六月下旬至七月上旬，又离开爱国公约进行了全厂保安大检查。由于中心工作和爱国公约完全脱节，爱国公约就渐渐被大家忘掉了。
    中共清河制呢厂总支委员会对于上述问题，曾联系文件学习认真作了检查。开始，领导干部之间曾经发生过激烈的争论，有的同志认为本厂虽然没有执行好爱国公约，但是组织职工学习了马恒昌小组的经验，举行过废品展览会，做过抗美援朝报告，这些都是政治工作，为什么人民日报说爱国公约订立和执行的不好就是忽视政治的倾向呢？后来才认识到这是对爱国公约的政治意义认识不足，没有把爱国公约作为推动各项工作的动力。
    甚至有的同志曾说：“如果说忽视爱国公约是忽视政治工作的倾向，那么执行保安大检查是错误的吗？”后来才认识到这是把爱国公约和中心工作对立起来的看法，保安大检查等中心工作当然很重要，但是为什么不能够通过爱国公约来更好地推动这些中心工作呢？
    还有的同志在学习前认为自己是做政治工作的，没有忽视政治的倾向，后来才认识到自己没有掌握住爱国公约这一项重要的政治工作，只是把甲、乙、丙、丁许多任务罗列起来，来了什么干什么，使政治工作失掉明确的中心，结果就会成为事务主义的政治工作者。该厂党政工团、领导干部经过这次认真的学习和检查，认识到了爱国公约的政治意义，已决定重新制订爱国竞赛公约，把爱国公约和下半年增产计划结合起来把向马恒昌小组竞赛计划及捐献计划合并于爱国竞赛公约之内，以爱国竞赛公约为中心，推动各项生产工作，在全厂及小组爱国竞赛公约制订之后，即将组织全厂性的执行爱国竞赛公约的竞赛运动。
