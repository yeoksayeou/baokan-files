　　A Great Joy for the People of Zhangbei
    ——Visiting the Home of Yao Sheng, a Hero of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    Cao Shiqin
    The leaves are green, the flowers are red, bright red flowers are blooming,
    Everyone loves them, everyone respects them, whoever wears a red flower is glorious.
                      ——Chabei Folk Song
    Today, July 15th, is a day of great joy for the entire family of Yao Jinbao, the elder.
    In front of his house, a colorful archway of red and green has been erected. Hanging horizontally on the archway is a gold-lettered plaque jointly presented by the Communist Party of China Chabei Local Committee, the Chabei Administrative Office, and other organizations, inscribed with "Hero Who Defends the Country and Safeguards Peace"; large embroidered balls made of colorful silk flutter in the wind on both sides of the plaque. The pink walls are covered with various silk banners and brocade hangings, making the whole house glow red. Those coming to offer congratulations and those coming to visit have been non-stop throughout the day. Regardless of men, women, old, or young, people come here with hearts of respect and admiration. The elderly are discussing with each other, "The Communist Party truly cherishes talent and doesn't neglect its children at all." The young people encourage each other, "Killing American devils to perform meritorious service for the people is truly glorious!" Zheng Cheng, a child from Fifth Street, after visiting here, ran home to tell his mother, "I want to grow up quickly to kill American devils and perform meritorious service, to bring glory to our family."
    The glory of the Yao family is the glory of the Chinese people, and even more so, the glory of the working people. The Yao family, every one of them, has been tempered by hardship. The young Yao Sheng studied for a few years as a child, but because his family couldn't afford it, they had him tend livestock, drive carts, and grind flour for others, living a life of semi-starvation. Later, he was seized by the Kuomintang bandit gang and forced into the army. He suffered for half a year in the Kuomintang army until he was liberated when our army liberated Zhangjiakou. From then on, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, he embarked on a bright path. When the family received this news, they said, "This child is fortunate, following Chairman Mao's troops, he's sure to make it." Before these words had even settled, Yao Sheng performed a great meritorious service in the Taiyuan liberation campaign in April 1949. Last winter, in order to defend the motherland and safeguard peace, Yao Sheng signed up to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and in Korea, he performed another great meritorious service. This is the second great meritorious service he has performed for the people. Who in the family wouldn't be happy?
    This is indeed a great joy. The entire city of Zhangbei came to celebrate the meritorious service of his family. Yao Sheng's second sister-in-law said, "Even when I got married, it wasn't this lively." Elder Yao said, "I've lived for sixty-three years, and this is the happiest day." He excitedly told everyone, "Our whole family has agreed to write a letter to Yao Sheng, telling him about the celebration for our family in the whole city, and instructing him: he must kill more American bandits and perform more meritorious service for the people, only then will he be worthy of Chairman Mao."

　　张北人民的大喜事
    ——访志愿军某部功臣姚盛的家庭
    曹世钦
    叶儿绿，花儿红，朵朵红花放光明，
    人人爱，人人敬，谁带红花谁光荣。
                      ——察北民歌
    今天，七月十五日，是姚进宝老大爷全家大喜的一天。
    在他家的门前，高高搭着一座红绿两色的彩牌楼。牌楼上横挂着中共察北地方委员会、察北专署等机关联合赠送的金字匾额，上面写着“保家卫国功臣”；用彩绸挽起的大绣球，在匾的两边迎风摆动。粉墙上，挂着各色各样的锦旗和锦幛，映得满屋通红。来道贺的，来参观的，这一天人没有断过。不论男女老少，人们都以崇敬、赞美的心情走到这儿来。老年人在互相议论：“共产党真爱惜人材，一点也不窝囊子弟。”年轻人互相鼓励：“杀美国鬼子为人民立功，真是光荣哟！”五街的一个儿童郑成，来过这儿之后，跑回家去跟他妈说：“我要快些长大了杀美国鬼子立功，给咱家争光荣。”
    姚家的光荣，是中国人民的光荣，更是劳动人民的光荣。姚老大爷一家子，全是从苦难里磨炼出来的人。年青的姚盛，小时念过几年书，因为家里供不起，便叫他给人家放牲口、赶车、磨面，过着半饥不暖的日子。后来叫国民党匪帮抓走当了兵。他在国民党军队里受了半年罪，直到我军解放张家口时，才被解放出来。从此，在毛主席的领导下，他走上了光明的道路。家里得到了这个消息，都说：“这孩子有福气，跟着毛主席的队伍，十准赖不了。”这句话还没落地，在一九四九年四月解放太原战役中，姚盛就立了大功。去年冬天，为了保卫祖国，保卫和平，姚盛报名参加了中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜又立了大功。这是他给人民立下的第二次大功，一家子谁能不喜呢？
    这的确是大喜，张北全城人民，都来给他家庆功。姚盛的二嫂说：“我出嫁时也没这么热闹过。”姚老大爷说：“我活了六十三岁，这是最欢喜的一天。”他兴奋地告诉大家：“我们全家合计好了，把全城给我家贺功的情形，写信告诉姚盛，嘱咐他：要更多地杀美国强盗，更多地给人民立功，才对得起毛主席。”
