　　Provisional Measures for the Determination of Funds for State-Owned Enterprises

    Article 1  These measures are formulated in accordance with the "Decision on Clearing Assets and Determining Funds of State-Owned Enterprises" to formally determine the state investment amount of state-owned enterprises, strengthen the management of enterprise funds, and establish the foundation for economic accounting.
    Article 2  The calculation and determination of funds for all national state-owned enterprises shall be based on Renminbi.
    Article 3  The funds that should be calculated and determined for all national state-owned enterprises include two types: fixed assets and working capital.
    Article 4  All national state-owned enterprises should, based on the actual situation in the first half of 1951 and the production and sales plan for the second half of 1951, make careful calculations in financial terms, do everything possible to accelerate the turnover of working capital, so as to make the most effective and rational use of funds, and calculate the required working capital quota according to the following principles:
    1. Quota for raw materials, materials, fuels, and auxiliary materials:
    The quota of major raw materials, materials, fuels, and auxiliary materials should be calculated based on the average daily required quantity (the product of consumption quota and average daily output), according to the situation of procurement, transportation, etc., to calculate the minimum necessary reserve days to ensure normal production (from the date of payment for procurement to the actual input into production, including the actual number of days required in the process of transportation, acceptance, storage, and preparation before input into production). Based on this, calculate the quota funds for all reserves. If it is a special reserve material, a certain insurance reserve period can be calculated.
    If it is difficult to calculate non-major raw materials, materials, fuels, and auxiliary materials according to the consumption quota, the minimum necessary reserve amount can be calculated separately based on the actual average remaining amount of each item, deducting the excessive accumulation, and according to the new production conditions.
    2. Spare parts quota:
    Should be determined according to the sporadic repair plan of fixed assets; or use the actual average remaining amount of the enterprise in the first half of the year as the quota for the second half of the year.
    3. Low-value and consumable quota:
    Can be calculated according to the minimum necessary quota based on (1) the number of workers, (2) the number of lathes, and (3) the cost of production, based on the past historical experience of each enterprise, or based on the performance and quality of low-value and consumable items.
    4. Work-in-progress quota:
    Calculate the total production cost based on the production quantity and unit cost of each product in the production plan period (such as a year or a quarter), then multiply by the production cycle and the work-in-progress coefficient (the percentage of the average cost of work-in-progress to the cost of the product), and divide by the number of days in the plan period (such as 360 days or 90 days) to calculate the required capital quota for each product in the work-in-progress period. The sum of various work-in-progress quotas is the capital quota required for all work-in-progress.
    If it is difficult to calculate according to the above method, it can be calculated according to the actual average remaining amount in the first half of the year.
    5. Product quota:
    According to the sales conditions, calculate the minimum necessary reserve amount based on the average turnover period of the product. The calculation of the average turnover period, in industrial products, refers to the average number of days required from the date of completion of the product to the date of delivery of the product and the collection of payment. For commodities in trading enterprises, it refers to the average number of days required from the date of payment for procurement, including the processes of transportation, acceptance, and storage, to the date of delivery of the commodity and the collection of payment.
    The phrase "until the payment is collected" is limited to the normal time required for handling account settlement after delivery and handover, and does not include accounts receivable that are in arrears.
    6. Prepaid expense quota:
    Refers to the expenses for prepaid new product research and experimentation for the next period, ordering newspapers and magazines, etc., and the average necessary amount of funds can be calculated according to the actual needs.
    7. Cash on hand:
    Refers to the petty cash that is legally kept in custody and the sales proceeds of trading institutions in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of Chapter 2 of the Measures for the Implementation of Currency Management. The sum of the working capital required for each of the above items is the working capital quota required by the enterprise, and the working capital turnover rate is calculated accordingly.
    Article 5  All national state-owned enterprises, in addition to calculating the required working capital quota in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article, should strictly calculate and review the minimum necessary state investment amount level by level according to the enterprise's own production and financial plan and the actual situation of assets and liabilities at the end of June. An opinion must be prepared and submitted to the National Capital Verification Committee. If the actual quantity of raw materials, materials, fuels, finished products, etc. in each unit exceeds the quota, a detailed list of excess reserves and a sales or usage plan shall be filled out, reviewed and compiled level by level, and reported to the National Capital Verification Committee.
    Article 6  For seasonal production or business operations, and other special reasons for the need for working capital used for abnormal turnover, should be resolved by short-term credit from the National Bank.
    Article 7  All national state-owned enterprises should, according to the production tasks assigned by the state in 1951, calculate the minimum necessary fixed assets (including the reserve portion for this year) based on production organization, equipment capacity, and technical and economic norms. This asset is listed as the fixed assets used. All fixed assets that are not used and are not needed by the unit should be listed as separate asset subjects, and detailed lists should be prepared separately, and submitted level by level for review and compilation.
    Article 8  All national state-owned enterprises, if there are stagnant inventory materials, should be cleaned up, set up asset accounts, and another list of stagnant materials should be reported, which should be reviewed and compiled level by level by the competent departments of each enterprise, and forwarded to the National Capital Verification Committee.
    The competent departments of each enterprise should, together with the capital verification committee at the same level, propose a regulatory plan according to the nature and use of stagnant materials, and quickly organize the adjustment within the following scope to reduce stagnant accumulation:
    1. Adjustments should be made on the spot or within a certain region or nationwide within the system to which the enterprise belongs.
    2. Each department in the large administrative region and each department of the central government should make adjustments between departments or regions.
    The adjustment plan for stagnant materials shall be submitted to the National Capital Verification Committee.
    Article 9  After the completion of asset clearance, the calculation and determination of funds for all national state-owned enterprises shall be strictly reviewed level by level by the capital verification committees at all levels, compiled according to the prescribed forms and reports, signed with opinions, attached with the production and financial plans of each enterprise, and reported to the National Capital Verification Committee in the following procedure:
    1. Enterprises directly operated by the central ministries shall be reviewed and compiled level by level by the capital verification committees at all levels, re-examined by the capital verification committee of the central competent ministry, and enterprises managed by the large administrative regions shall be reviewed and compiled level by level by the capital verification committees at all levels in the large administrative regions, initially verified by the capital verification committee of the large administrative region, and reported separately to the central competent ministry and the National Capital Verification Committee. Enterprises directly managed by provinces and cities shall be reviewed and compiled level by level by the capital verification committees at all levels, and re-examined by the central competent ministry.
    For the above enterprises, the central competent ministry shall compile them separately according to professional systems within the scope of its unified management of funds (including business funds directly controlled by the ministry), and submit them to the National Capital Verification Committee for final verification together with the official review opinion.
    2. Enterprises directly operated by various departments in the large administrative regions shall be reviewed and compiled level by level by the capital verification committees at all levels under the jurisdiction of the region, and finally verified by the capital verification committee of the large administrative region, and reported separately to the central competent ministry and the National Capital Verification Committee for record.
    Article 10  After the enterprise funds of national state-owned enterprises are finally verified by the state investment, the surplus or deficit of funds shall be subject to necessary capital adjustments level by level by the competent departments of each enterprise, and formal investment transfer procedures shall be carried out with the financial departments at the same level respectively. The specific methods shall be promulgated separately by the Central Ministry of Finance.
    Article 11  The work of clearing assets and determining funds for all national state-owned enterprises shall be completed within the following prescribed time limit:
    1. The provinces and cities of the large administrative regions and state-owned enterprises directly entrusted by the central government shall be completed by the end of November 1951 at the latest.
    2. Various central financial and economic departments shall be completed by the end of December 1951 at the latest.
    3. The National Capital Verification Committee shall be completed by the end of January 1952 at the latest.
    Article 12  The formats and procedures for filling in and reporting various major reports required for the verification of funds for all national state-owned enterprises shall be uniformly formulated and promulgated separately.
    Article 13  The capital verification committees of the major administrative regions and the central competent ministries may, in accordance with the provisions of these measures, combine the actual situation of their affiliated enterprises, and uniformly formulate specific implementation supplementary measures, and report them to the National Capital Verification Committee for record.
    Article 14  The management methods for fixed assets and working capital after the determination of fixed assets and working capital shall be determined separately by the Central Ministry of Finance.
    Article 15  These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

　　国营企业资金核定暂行办法
    第一条根据《关于国营企业清理资产核定资金的决定》，为正式确定国营企业的国家投资额，加强企业的资金管理，建立经济核算制的基础，特制定本办法。
    第二条  全国国营企业，其资金的计算与核定，一律以人民币为计算本位。
    第三条  全国国营企业，其应计算与核定的资金，包括固定资金与流动资金两种。
    第四条  全国国营企业，应根据一九五一年度上半年度实际状况，与一九五一年度下半年度的生产和供销计划，在财务方面精打细算，尽一切可能，加速流动资金的周转，以使资金作最有效与合理的运用，并依下列原则计算所需流动资金定额：
    一、原料、材料、燃料和辅助材料定额：
    主要原料、材料、燃料和辅助材料的定额，应根据每日平均需要数量（消耗定额与每日平均生产量的乘积），按采购、运输等状况，计算其为保证供应正常生产最低必需的储备日数（自采购付款日起以迄实际投入生产前为止，包括在运、验收、保管和投入生产前的准备各过程中间所需的实际天数）。据以计算其全部储备的定额资金。如属特殊备料，得计算一定的保险储备期。
    非主要原料、材料、燃料和辅助材料，如依照消耗定额计算有困难时，可分别根据各项实际平均余存额，减除其过量积储部分，并按新的生产条件等计算其最低必需的储备额。
    二、备品定额：
    应根据固定资产的零星修理计划确定；或以上半年度企业实际平均余存额作为下半年度的定额。
    三、低值和易耗品定额：
    可根据各企业过去历史经验，或根据低值和易耗品的性能品质，分别按（一）工人数目，（二）车床数目，（三）生产费用，计算其最低必需的定额。
    四、在制品定额：
    根据每种产品在生产计划期中（如年或季）的生产数量与单位成本，计算出生产总成本，再乘以生产循环周期及在制品系数（在制品平均成本占产品成本的百分比），除以计划期中的天数（如三六○天或九○天），计算出此种产品在制期中所需资金定额，各种在制品定额相加，即为全部在制品所需资金定额。
    如按上述方法计算有困难时，可根据上半年度实际平均余存额计算。
    五、产品定额：
    根据销售条件，按产品平均周转期，计算其最低必需的储备额，平均周转期的计算，在工业产品，系指自产品完成日起至产品出库并将货款收清时止，中间所需的平均天数。在贸易企业的商品，则指自采购付款日起包括在运、验收、保管等过程，至商品出库，并将货款收清时止，中间所需的平均天数。
    所指“将货款收清时止”，仅以在发货交接后办理收账结算的正常所需时间为限，不包括赊欠的应收账款在内。
    六、预付费用定额：
    系指预付下期的新产品研究试验费，订购报章杂志等费用，可按实际需用情况，计算平均必需的资金额。
    七、库存现金：
    系指根据货币管理实施办法第二章第五条的规定，即法定自行保管的零星现金以及贸易机构的售货款。基于以上各项目计算所需流动资金之和，即为企业所需流动资金的定额，并据以计算其流动资金周转率。
    第五条  全国国营企业，除按前条规定核算所需流动资金定额外，应按企业本身生产和财务计划及六月底的资产负债实际情况，逐级严格计算并审核其最低必需的国家投资额。并须拟具意见书，报送全国核资委员会。如各单位的原料、材料、燃料、成品等实有数量超过定额者，应填制超储存料明细表和销售或使用计划，逐级审核汇编层报全国核资委员会。
    第六条  凡季节性的生产或营业，以及其他特殊原因所需用作非正常周转的流动资金，应由国家银行短期信贷解决。
    第七条  全国国营企业，应根据一九五一年度国家所给予的生产任务，按生产组织，设备能力，结合技术经济定额，计算最低必需保有的固定资产（包括本年度备用部分），此项资产列为使用的固定资产，凡未使用及本单位根本不需用的固定资产，应另列资产科目，分别造具详细清册，逐级审核汇编上报。
    第八条  全国国营企业，如有库存呆滞材料，应加清理，分设资产账户，并另造报呆滞材料清册由各企业主管部门逐级审核汇编，转报全国核资委员会。
