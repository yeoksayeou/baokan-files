    Works and Translations Should Indicate the Year of Completion

    To the Editor:

    When I read books, I often encounter difficulties because I don't know the year the book was written. Here are a few examples:

    (1) "From this table, it can be seen that the industry of Britain and Germany is currently still lower than pre-war levels." (See Liberation Press edition, Leontief, *Political Economy*, page 370)

    (2) "The Soviet China of today is a powerful force. The Chinese Soviets control many areas with over sixty million people..." (Ibid., page 402)

    (3) "On March 21st of this year, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brannan said: 'Our meat and dairy products...are declining, while our various surpluses are increasing.'" (See Youth Publishing House edition, Ilin, translated by Chen Yanxi and Sun Wei: *Earth and People*)

    The above examples are just a few that I randomly picked from several books. In (1) and (2), there are two instances of "currently" and one of "pre-war." Which year and month does "currently" refer to? Which "pre-war" are we talking about? In (3), there is "March 21st of this year." Which year's March 21st is meant? These problems can all be solved if the year the book was written is made clear. However, precisely because the book does not explain this point, readers often cannot thoroughly understand the content.

    I am not the only one who feels this difficulty. Many other comrades feel the same way. Therefore, I earnestly make two suggestions to our authors, translators, and the publishing industry:

    1. When authors and translators publish their works or translations, they must indicate the year the book was written (translations should also indicate the year the original was written).

    2. For books published in the past that do not indicate the year of completion, this should be added in the reprinting.

                                              Huang Ming

### 著作或译作都要注明著成的年月

专栏：读者来信

    著作或译作都要注明著成的年月编辑同志：
    当我在看书的时候，往往因为不知道书的著成年月而感到许多困难，试举出下面几个例子：
    （一）“从这个表上可以看出，英国和德国的工业，现时还低过战前的水平。”（见解放社版，列昂节夫著《政治经济学》三七○页）
    （二）“现时苏维埃的中国，是一种强大的力量，中国的苏维埃，领有六千万以上人口的许多区域……………。”（同前书四○二页）
    （三）“今年三月二十一日美国农业部长布洛南说：‘我们的肉类、乳产物……………正走下坡路，而我们的各种过剩品正在增加’。”（见青年出版社版，伊林著，陈延熙、孙维合译：《地球与人》）
    以上几个例子是我随便从几本书中摘下来的，（一）（二）中有两个“现时”，有一个“战前”，是属于何年何月的“现时”呢？是哪个“战前”呢？（三）中有一个“今年三月二十一日”，又是属于哪一年三月二十一日呢？这些问题，只要弄明白每本书的著成年月，就都可以解决，但是却正因为书中没有说明白这点，就往往使读者对书的内容不能透彻了解。
    感到这种困难的不仅是我个人，其他许多同志也有同样感觉，所以我恳切的向我们的著作者、翻译者以及出版界提出两个建议：
    一、著作者和翻译者将著作或译作出版时，一定要将书的著成年月注明（译作也要将原文著成年月注明）。
    二、过去出版的书没有注明著成年月的，在再版时应该补记明白。
                                              黄明
