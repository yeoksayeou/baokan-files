　　Some Directly Subordinate Factories and Mines of the Ministry of Fuel Industry
    Have Not Formed a Mass Movement for Verifying Funds
    Some Cadres Believe That the Clearing of Materials is "Almost Done"
    Some leading cadres of directly subordinate factories and mines of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry do not attach importance to the work of verifying funds and believe that this work has been done "almost done." Therefore, this work is still in the stage of being done by a few people and has not yet formed a mass anti-waste movement. Although electricity and petroleum units have held meetings and carried out preparatory work such as sorting, numbering, and registering cards, they are still only being done by a few people. When the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau No. 2 Plant cleaned the warehouse last year, it transferred two motors to improve the efficiency of the machinery and equipment. However, when cleaning the materials this time, some people still didn't know why. Therefore, they mistakenly believed: "Another cleaning is coming, and the machines will be transferred again soon." Employees of the bureau's No. 1 plant are afraid that the main materials such as mica sheets will be transferred during the cleaning of materials. Some technicians believe: "The verification of funds is the work of the management department and has nothing to do with me." Many cadres in the coal mine system believe that "it has already been cleaned and evaluated, and it will be just like this if we do it again." Some cadres in the coal mine system feel that the production task is very large and there are many capital construction problems, so they do not have the time to lead and organize the work of verifying funds. Therefore, the coal mine system has not yet launched this work. When the Shijingshan Power Plant started this work, it also believed that the materials had been cleaned three times and were "almost" done, so there was no need to do it again; but during this cleaning, it was found that the previous cleaning and valuation were inaccurate; so they organized cadres to study the documents on verifying funds and reversed the idea of ​​"almost."
    The above phenomena all show that some cadres in the fuel industry system have not yet realized the importance of verifying funds, and have not regarded this work as a turning point in business management. Therefore, they have not combined this work with the mass anti-waste struggle to lay the foundation for the implementation of the economic accounting system.
    In fact, the phenomenon of waste in the fuel industry system is very serious. Taking the comparison between the occupied working capital and the total annual production cost of the fuel industry system in 1950, it can be found that the working capital is wasted a lot, and the turnover is only once a year, and some factories and mines do not even turn over once. The main reason for the low turnover rate is the lack of attention to the use of working capital, excessive material accumulation, and very low equipment utilization. In terms of material supply in various factories and mines, there is no plan at all. The material-using departments often put forward material plans that are not realistic, but hope "the more the better." The supply department does not ask whether the materials are suitable, but grabs them if they have them. For example, the Huainan Mining Bureau once submitted a material list that exceeded the original financial plan by ten times. The material plan submitted by the Yumen Mining Bureau for the second half of 1951 even exceeded the original financial plan by eight times. In 1950, the Huainan Shandong and other mining bureaus ordered water pumps and high-end vehicles in Shanghai, which cost a lot of money, but they were not used. As a result, many projects that should have been done by various units were stopped due to the accumulation of funds on equipment, which affected the completion of the national construction plan.
    The utilization rate of machinery and equipment in various factories and mines is very low. The efficiency of the equipment is not fully utilized, and even many equipment are placed in the warehouse without use. For example, in the past, more than 1,000 lathes in coal mines in East China and North China were not well organized for production. Huainan has more than 3,000 miner's lamps unused. Shandong also has many motors that are not utilized. The Tianjin and Shijingshan power plants have nine boilers with an evaporation capacity of about 140 tons, which have not been utilized. This waste of production capacity is very serious.
    Due to the lack of attention to the capital management system, the phenomenon of corruption is also quite serious. For example, Liu Xuguang of the Shandong Mining Bureau embezzled 200 million yuan and absconded. Liu Jialin of Datong embezzled 1.9 million yuan and absconded. The Fengfeng Mining Bureau prepaid merchants 130 million yuan for pit wood, and the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau prepaid merchants 40 million yuan for pit wood, all of which could not be recovered. The Northwest Sales Company of the Petroleum Bureau even has serious theft of public property. Therefore, when various factories and mines clear materials and verify funds this time, they must launch an anti-waste struggle and expose these serious waste phenomena. Based on these waste phenomena, education should be carried out among all employees to propose how to improve operating methods and repair machines in the future to maximize their efficiency and prolong the life of the machines. How to save raw materials and set reasonable quota standards. Only in this way can all employees recognize the importance of cleaning up assets and verifying funds; can the cleaning up of assets and verifying funds become a mass work; can the reasonable quota standards for the rational use of raw materials and the rational allocation of machinery and equipment be correctly proposed; can waste be eliminated, and the state-given production tasks be completed with the possible minimum amount of funds, laying the foundation for the implementation of the economic accounting system.

### 燃料工业部部分直属厂矿核定资金未形成群众性运动  有些干部竟认为清理资材已经“差不多了”

　　燃料工业部部分直属厂矿
    核定资金未形成群众性运动
    有些干部竟认为清理资材已经“差不多了”
    中央燃料工业部直属厂矿部分领导干部不重视核定资金工作，认为这个工作已经做得“差不多了”。因此，这个工作还停留在少数人做的阶段，还没有形成群众性的反浪费运动。电业和石油等单位虽召开了会议，并进行了整理、编号和登记卡片等准备工作，但都还只是由少数人来做的。天津电业局二厂在去年清理仓库时，为了发挥机器设备的效能，曾调出电机两部。但当这次清理资材时，有人还不知道是为什么。因此错误地认为：“又来清理了，机器又快调走了。”该局一厂员工害怕在清理资材时，把云母片等主要材料调走。有些技术人员认为：“核定资金是经理部门的工作，与我无关。”煤矿系统许多干部以为“早就清理、估价过了，再搞也不过是这个样子。”有些煤矿系统干部觉得生产任务很大，基本建设问题很多，因此没有功夫去领导和组织核定资金工作。所以，目前煤矿系统还没有展开这个工作。石景山发电厂开始进行这个工作时，也是认为已经清理资材三次了，已“差不多”了，不必再做了；但在这次清理时，发现过去的清理和估价都不准确；于是才组织干部学习核定资金的文件，扭转了“差不多”的思想。
    上述现象，都说明了燃料工业系统中的有些干部还没有认识到核定资金的重要性，还没有把这工作当成是经营管理的转折点，因此就没有把这工作和群众性的反浪费斗争结合起来，为实行经济核算制打下基础。
    事实上，燃料工业系统中的浪费现象是很严重的。以一九五○年燃料工业系统的占有流动资金和全年生产总成本的比较来看，就可以发现流动资金浪费很大，全年只周转一次，有些厂矿还周转不到一次。造成周转率很低的原因，主要是因为不重视流动资金的使用，器材积压过多，设备利用率很低等。在各厂矿器材供应方面，毫无计划。用料部门往往不切实际地提出用料计划，而是希望“愈多愈好”。供应部门却不问材料是否合用，有了就抓。如淮南矿务局有一次提出的料单，超过了原有财务计划的十倍。玉门矿务局提出的一九五一年下半年的用料计划，竟超过了原有财务计划的八倍。淮南山东等矿务局一九五○年在上海订购水泵和高车时，占款很多，但未使用，因而许多单位应做的工程，由于资金积压在器材上边，以致现在因无款而停工，影响了国家建设计划的完成。
    各厂矿机器设备的利用率是很不高的。没有充分发挥设备效能，甚至许多设备放在仓库里不用。如过去华东和华北等地煤矿有一千多部车床未很好组织起来生产。淮南有三千多盏矿灯未使用。山东有许多电动机也未利用。天津和石景山的发电厂有九个锅炉，约一百四十吨蒸发量，亦未被利用。这种对于生产能力的浪费现象是很严重的。
    由于不重视资金的管理制度，贪污现象亦相当严重。如山东矿务局刘叙光贪污二亿元潜逃。大同刘家林贪污一百九十万元潜逃。峰峰矿务局预付商人坑木款一亿三千万元，焦作矿务局预付商人坑木款四千万元，均无法收回。石油局西北运销公司甚至还存在着严重的偷盗公物的现象。因之各厂矿在这次清理资材核定资金的时候，就必须展开反浪费的斗争，对于这些严重的浪费现象加以揭发。根据这些浪费现象，在全体职工中进行教育，提出今后如何改进操作方法和检修机器，使其发挥最大的效能，延长机器的寿命。如何节约原材料，并定出合理的定额标准。只有这样，才会使得全体职工群众认清清理资产核定资金的重要性；才能使清理资产核定资金成为群众性的工作；才能正确地提出原材料合理使用的定额标准，和机器设备应有的合理配备；才能杜绝浪费，以可能的最少量的资金完成国家所给予的生产任务，打下实行经济核算制的基础。
