After the Establishment of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region
Li Zonghai

When the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army passed through Xikang on its way north to resist Japan in 1935, it helped the local Tibetan people establish the "Boba Special District Government," leaving a profound impact on the Tibetan people. Now, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the Tibetan people in eastern Xikang Province established the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government in November last year. This government leads the people of the entire region in various construction undertakings, advancing towards an infinitely bright future.

Xikang was liberated in March 1950, ending the reactionary ruling class's policy of national oppression. Due to the correct propaganda and implementation of national policies by the People's Liberation Army and local working cadres, the ethnic divisions created by the reactionary ruling class in history have gradually been eliminated, and the unity among all ethnic groups has grown stronger day by day. The Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region was established on this foundation of unity.

The Southwest Military and Administrative Committee and the Xikang Provincial People's Government, based on the national policy of the Common Program, conducted multiple studies on the establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, determined the steps and guidelines for establishing the autonomous region, and carried out preparatory work with the help of the Central Nationalities Visiting Group. In order to convene a people's representative conference of all circles, cadre training classes were held. With adequate cadre conditions, the Tibetan Autonomous Region was quickly established. The establishment of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region adopted a national form. This is precisely the characteristic of national regional autonomous power. The first people's representative conference of all ethnic groups and all circles in the autonomous region fully demonstrated the national characteristics. The representatives came from all aspects, including Tibetan, Han, Yi, and Hui, representing various ethnic groups and strata. The venue was filled with slogans in Tibetan, Han, and Yi languages. The conference prepared sufficient translations so that representatives could freely exchange opinions without being restricted by language at the general meeting or in group meetings. Among the thirty members of the Autonomous Region People's Government, twenty-two were Tibetan, six were Han, one was Hui, and one was Yi. The chairman, Sangji Yexi, is a Tibetan who, along with committee member Sana, has fought for the liberation of the Chinese people and the Tibetan people for more than a dozen years under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. All members are warmly supported and loved by the local people.

Since its establishment more than half a year ago, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great national policy and under the leadership of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee and the Xikang Provincial People's Government, work has made great progress, and the autonomous region has presented a new atmosphere.

As a result of implementing regional autonomy, the people of all ethnic groups and within the Tibetan ethnicity have become more united. Phenomena such as "clan fights" and "vendettas" that have existed for many years have basically stopped. In particular, the relationship between the Tibetan and Han ethnic groups has become increasingly close. At the representative meetings in Ganzi, Daofu, Luhuo, and other counties, after signing unity pacts, many major Tusi and headmen expressed their intention to unite and help each other in the future. This pact was solemnly written on red silk, and the representatives signed their names. Yao Yuequezha (member of the Autonomous Region Consultative Committee), a representative from Daofu, and Tang Liang (representative of Linghuo Temple) had a ten-year "private feud" due to the instigation of reactionary rulers. After mediation, they reconciled at the representative meeting. The two also swore an oath before Chairman Mao's portrait, expressing their determination to unite. The development of the autonomous region's work quickly affected neighboring tribes, and they established good relations with the People's Government. For example, in nomadic areas such as Zhuosijia, workers had never been there since liberation. After the Tibetan compatriots there heard about the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government, they sent representatives to pay respects to the government and requested that cadres be sent there. The establishment of the autonomous region not only strengthened the relationship between the people of all ethnic groups and the government but also united the various ethnic groups and within each ethnic group.

After its establishment, the Autonomous Region People's Government first focused on building political power. In order to help the various counties carry out their work, it successively sent more than 300 work teams and working groups. As of mid-May, fifteen counties had convened their first people's representative conferences or consultative committees and established county people's governments. Qianning County has completed the construction of people's political power at the county and district levels. The five counties outside the pass are also holding or are about to hold representative conferences and establish people's governments. The composition of the county people's government committees, in addition to being mainly Tibetan, also pays attention to absorbing people of other ethnic groups in the county to participate.

The Autonomous Region People's Government has cultivated a large number of ethnic minority cadres. Kangding has a national school, and each county has held national cadre training classes, cultivating 1,086 Tibetan cadres. Together with the Tibetan cadres before the establishment of the autonomous region, there are currently 1,607 people participating in various jobs or studying in Chengdu, Chongqing, and Beijing. At present, the cultivation of cadres of all ethnic groups is still continuing on a large scale, laying the foundation for the further development of the regional autonomy work of the Tibetan people.

In terms of production and construction, great achievements have been made in the past six months. In order to support and develop agricultural production in the Tibetan areas, the Autonomous Region People's Government has focused on distributing 250,000 jin of agricultural loan grain (rice) and has planned to distribute tea seeds and try planting tea trees in some areas. The trade company signed contracts with peddlers, paying for tea first and then collecting local products, and purchased a large amount of local products. From June of last year to April of this year, the trade company purchased local products worth 10.96665 billion yuan (RMB) in the Tibetan areas. The Tibetan people exchanged local products for 182,775 packages of tea, greatly increasing the income of the Tibetan people and improving their lives. In order to develop the animal husbandry of the Tibetan people, a livestock epidemic prevention team of 59 people was recently organized to work in various counties. The enthusiasm of the masses for production is unprecedentedly high. According to a report from Zhanhua: all the wasteland in the suburbs of Zhanhua City has been cultivated. The lamas in the Muya area of Kangding have also formulated a wasteland reclamation plan, and four lama temples, including Qumu and Riku, have signed a contract with the trade company to order 30,000 jin of rhubarb to be dug. At present, the People's Government is preparing to help farmers improve old farm tools and improve production technology.

The people of the autonomous region have demonstrated a high degree of political consciousness in the movements to resist America and aid Korea and to suppress counter-revolutionaries. They have recognized that American imperialism is our mortal enemy and have further realized the loveliness of the motherland. As of the end of April, 12,500 people in Kangding city and the surrounding villages alone signed declarations in support of the five major powers concluding a peace treaty and voted against the United States arming Japan. 6,785 people in the urban area received education on resisting America and aiding Korea, and nearly 4,000 people organized current affairs studies. Most people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life signed patriotic pacts and pledged to support the Chinese and Korean People's troops and the troops peacefully marching into Tibet with practical actions. At present, a movement to donate airplanes and cannons is being launched throughout the region. The movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries has been vigorously launched in Kangding. People of all ethnic groups have actively reported counter-revolutionary elements and assisted the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. From April 8th to the end of April, people of all ethnic groups reported and assisted public security organs in arresting 22 counter-revolutionary elements.

The Autonomous Region People's Government is leading the people of all ethnic groups in the entire region to strive for greater victories.

　　西康藏族自治区成立之后
    李宗海
    一九三五年中国工农红军北上抗日经过西康时，曾帮助当地藏族人民成立了“博巴依特区政府”，给藏族人民留下了深刻的影响。现在，西康省东部的藏族人民在中央人民政府的领导下，于去年十一月间成立了藏族自治区人民政府。这个政府领导着全区人民进行了各种建设事业，向着无限光明的前途迈进。
    一九五○年三月，西康获得解放，终止了反动统治阶级的民族压迫政策。由于人民解放军与当地工作干部正确宣传并执行了民族政策，使历史上反动统治阶级所造成的民族隔阂逐渐消除，各族人民之间日益团结起来。西康藏族自治区就是在这种团结的基础上建立起来的。
    西南军政委员会、西康省人民政府，根据共同纲领的民族政策，为藏族自治区的建立，曾进行了多次的研究，确定了建立自治区的步骤与方针，并在中央民族访问团的帮助下，进行了筹备工作。为了召开各界人民代表会议，曾开办了干部训练班。有了相当的干部条件之后，藏族自治区就迅速地建立起来。西康藏族自治区的建立，采取了民族的形式。这正是民族区域自治政权的特点。在自治区第一届各族各界人民代表会议上，充分表现了民族的特色。代表们来自各方面，其中有藏族、汉族、彝族、回族，代表着各个民族，各个阶层。会场布满了藏、汉、彝各族文字的标语。会议准备了足够的翻译，使代表们在大会或小组会上可不受文字语言的限制，自由交换意见。自治区人民政府三十位委员中有藏族二十二人、汉族六人、回族一人、彝族一人。主席桑吉悦希是藏族人，他和委员萨纳，在中国共产党领导下，为中国人民、藏族人民的解放事业奋斗了十几年。所有委员都为当地人民热烈拥护与爱戴。
    自治区建立半年多以来，在毛主席伟大的民族政策指导下，在西南军政委员会及西康省人民政府领导下，工作已有很大开展，自治区呈现出新的气象。
    实行区域自治的结果，各族人民和藏族内部更加团结了。多少年来的“械斗”、“打冤家”等现象已基本停止。特别是藏、汉两民族间的关系日益密切。在甘孜、道孚、炉霍等县的代表会上，在签订了团结公约之后，很多主要土司、头人，表示今后要团结互助。这个公约被庄严地写在红绸上，代表们都签上了自己的名字。道孚代表尧曰却渣（自治区协商委员）和唐亮（灵萑寺代表）两人，由于反动统治者的挑拨结下了十年的“私仇”，经调解后也在代表会上和好了。两人并在毛主席像前宣誓，表示了团结的决心。自治区工作的开展，很快地影响到邻近的部落，他们和人民政府建立了良好的关系。如卓斯甲等游牧地区，解放后工作人员从未去过。那里的藏胞听到自治区人民政府成立后，即派代表向政府致敬，要求派干部到那里去。自治区的建立不仅密切了各族人民与政府的关系，而且使各民族间和民族内部团结起来了。
    自治区人民政府成立后，首先着手政权建设。为了帮助各县进行工作，曾先后派出工作团及工作队共三百余人。截至五月中旬，已有十五个县召开了首届人民代表会议或协商委员会，成立了县的人民政府。乾宁县已完成县、区两级人民政权的建设工作。关外五县也正在或将要召开代表会，成立人民政府。县人民政府委员会的组成，除以藏族为主体外，并注意吸收本县其他各族人民参加。
    自治区人民政府大量培养了民族干部。康定设有民族学校，各县均举办了民族干部训练班，培养出藏族干部一千零八十六人；连同自治区成立前的藏族干部，目前已有一千六百零七人参加了各种工作或到成都、重庆、北京学习。目前仍继续大量培养各民族干部，为藏族人民区域自治工作的进一步开展打下了基础。
    在生产建设方面，半年多来已获得很大成绩。为了扶植和发展藏区的农业生产，自治区人民政府有重点地发放了农业贷粮大米二十五万斤，并有计划地发放了茶籽，在部分地区试种茶树。贸易公司以先付茶、后交土产的办法和贩运者订立合同，大量收购土产。自去年六月至今年四月，贸易公司收购藏区土产价值人民币一百零九亿六千六百五十元；藏族人民以土产换回茶十八万二千七百七十五包，大大增加了藏族人民的收入与改善了生活。为了发展藏族人民的畜牧事业，最近又组织了五十九人的牲畜防疫队，到各县工作。群众生产情绪空前高涨，据瞻化报告：瞻化城郊的荒地已全部开垦。康定木雅区的喇嘛也订了开荒计划，取木、日库等四个喇嘛寺向贸易公司订了挖大黄三万斤的合同。目前人民政府正准备帮助农民改良旧有农具，改进生产技术。
    自治区人民在抗美援朝与镇压反革命运动中，表现了高度的政治觉悟。他们认清了美帝国主义是我们的死敌，进一步认识到祖国的可爱。截至四月底止，仅康定城区及周围乡村就有一万二千五百人签名拥护五大国缔结和平公约的宣言，投票反对美国武装日本；城区有六千七百八十五人受到抗美援朝的教育，近四千人组织了时事学习，各族各界人民大部签订了爱国公约，并保证以实际行动来支援中、朝人民部队和和平进军西藏的部队。目前全区正开展捐献飞机大炮运动。镇压反革命运动已在康定大张旗鼓地展开。各族人民纷纷检举反革命分子，协助政府镇压反革命。从四月八日到四月底止，各族人民检举并协助公安机关逮捕了反革命分子二十二人。
    自治区人民政府正领导着全区各族人民，为争取更大的胜利而奋斗。
