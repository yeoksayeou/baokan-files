　　Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: U.S. reactionary opinion openly admits that the U.S. policy towards Japan is to re-militarize Japan and use Japan to invade the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union and suppress national liberation movements in other parts of Asia. According to TASS, New York, August 29th: The Wall Street mouthpiece "Business Week" wrote: "Japan has become a key factor in the U.S. policy towards Asia." Lawrence, an observer for the "New York Herald Tribune," said that the "true meaning" of the draft peace treaty with Japan is that it "clears the way for rearming Japan to oppose Communist China and Soviet Russia."
    American newspapers openly admit that the draft peace treaty with Japan and the so-called Pacific Pact draft associated with it are used to strengthen the transformation of vast areas of the Pacific region into the sphere of influence of the United States and to exclude Britain from these areas. Observer Bowles pointed out in the "Foreign Policy Report" that the proposed treaties are intended to "make the United States responsible for exercising political functions in the Pacific."
    United Press International's Washington correspondent reported: Representatives of the State Department and the Department of the Army hope to establish a "military system" similar to the Atlantic Group in the Pacific. In order to establish this system, the United States is implementing the following measures:
    "First, insist on a peace treaty with Japan that allows Japan to rearm; second, plan to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan so that U.S. troops can be stationed in Japan indefinitely; third, use the Seventh Fleet to defend Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan; fourth, maintain troops in the Philippines; fifth, build huge bases on Okinawa; sixth, prepare to actually annex many islands in the Pacific under the guise of the United Nations; seventh, provide Southeast Asian countries with weapons and economic assistance. All of this makes it possible for the United States to infiltrate areas previously ruled by Britain or Japan."

　　美反动舆论公开承认
    美图利用日本侵略中国苏联
    【新华社三十一日讯】美国反动舆论公开承认美国对日本的政策，是使日本重新军国主义化，并利用日本侵略中华人民共和国与苏联和镇压亚洲其他地区的民族解放运动。据塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：华尔街的机关报“商业周刊”写道：“日本成了美国对亚政策的关键性的因素。”《纽约先驱论坛报》的观察家劳伦斯说：对日和约草案的“真正意义”，在于它“为重新武装日本、反对共产党中国与苏俄扫清道路”。
    美国报纸完全公开地承认：对日和约草案以及和它相关联的所谓太平洋公约草案，是用来加强把太平洋区域的广大地区变为美国的势力范围并把英国从这些地区排挤出去。观察家鲍列斯在《外交政策汇报》中指出：建议中的各种条约是为了“使美国负起在太平洋执行政治职能”的责任。
    合众社驻华盛顿记者报道：国务院与陆军部的代表们希望在太平洋建立类似大西洋集团的“军事体系”，为了建立这个体系，美国正在实施下列措施：
    “第一，坚持使日本可以重新武装的对日和约；第二，策划缔结单独对日和约，以使美国军队可以无限期地驻扎日本；第三，利用第七舰队保卫台湾的蒋介石；第四，保持在菲律宾的军队；第五，在冲绳岛建筑庞大的基地；第六，准备在联合国的庇护下实际吞并太平洋的许多岛屿；第七，供给东南亚各国以武器并在经济上给它们以援助。所有这一切都使美国有可能渗入战前由英国或日本统治的地区。”
