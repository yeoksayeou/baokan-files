    Crushing Feudal Remnant Forces
    Victorious Launch of Democratic Reform Work
    Hunan Yangmeishan Coal Mine has achieved victory in the struggle against feudal remnants through the implementation of democratic reform.
    Before liberation, the mine had a Kuomintang district party headquarters. Not only were the feudal elements colluding with the Kuomintang, but most of their leaders were themselves multifaceted figures, simultaneously serving as American-Chiang secret agents, feudal bosses, gang leaders, and Taoist leaders. These feudal elements cruelly ruled the workers, able to beat them to death at will without legal repercussions. After liberation, due to the mine's leading cadres' incorrect understanding of the policy of retaining original positions and salaries during the takeover period, the various unreasonable personnel relationships and management systems in the mine were never reformed. As a result, feudal remnants continued to occupy positions such as production team leaders and foremen. Among the mine's fifty or so production team leaders and foremen both underground and on the surface, feudal bosses accounted for thirty-five, and all ten underground production team leaders were controlled by boss elements. These feudal remnants used their authority to take in a large number of fleeing despots, landlords, reactionary military officers, and Kuomintang officials (including even a fake colonel and a fake county magistrate). They conspired with each other, pretended to be proactive, infiltrated the trade union, usurped the leadership of the entire mine's trade union organization, and colluded with external bandits, plotting to assassinate our military representative (the case has been solved). When the mine's administration proposed implementing safe production, they incited workers not to abide by regulations, and to dig haphazardly without following engineering specifications, resulting in continuous roof collapse accidents and greatly reducing the recovery rate. When workers launched production competitions, they sabotaged them in every possible way and used various methods to steal the honorary title of model worker. Therefore, the vast majority of workers urgently demanded that these feudal remnants be dealt with.
    During the labor insurance card registration in April this year, the mine's leading cadres originally attempted to deal with feudal remnants during the review of the card registration. However, because this review included issues from both within and outside the working class, and because the time was also limited, it was impossible to concentrate efforts on dealing with feudal remnants. As a result, after the card registration, counter-revolutionaries and feudal bosses remained at large. It was not until the Central China Bureau of the CPC's urban work conference issued its decision on launching the democratic reform movement in early June that the mine specifically began democratic reform work, establishing a democratic reform committee with the CPC Party Committee as its core to lead the work in a unified manner. At the beginning of the work, feudal remnants created various rumors, intimidated workers, and dismantled railways, blocked ventilation shafts, and attempted to create fatal accidents to sabotage production. In response to this situation, the mine's leading cadres immediately selected key points, went deep among the workers, exposed these conspiracies of the feudal remnants, and encouraged the workers' courage to fight. They also discovered and cultivated activists among the workers, forming core groups of activists from various units. These core groups connected with the masses, and many democratic reform groups were formed around each core group, thus forming the core and backbone force of the democratic reform movement. After the above efforts, and after repeatedly publicizing the policies of clearly distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves and treating different situations differently among the workers, more than 90% of the workers actively participated in the struggle. The mine held two democratic reform representative meetings and organized eighteen struggle meetings held by production unit. After the workers accused the feudal remnants at the struggle meetings, they were able to propose different handling methods according to the policies and the different situations of the feudal remnants. Therefore, all feudal remnants received the punishment they deserved. At present, the mine's democratic reform work is further developing towards the stage of democratic unity within the working class.
    After the feudal remnants in the mine were dealt with, the workers' sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs was greatly enhanced, and their enthusiasm for production soared. The entire mine has shown a new atmosphere. Although the movement occupied some production time, the production volume still increased by more than 20% compared to before the struggle. The coal pushing efficiency of the transportation team increased from 12 or 13 dou per person per day to 17 or 18 dou, setting a new record in the history of the mine. In order to protect safe production, the workers also voluntarily organized self-defense teams and four-prevention (fire prevention, water prevention, theft prevention, sabotage prevention) groups to patrol the mining area day and night.

　　湖南杨梅山煤矿
    打垮封建残余势力
    民主改革工作胜利开展
    湖南杨梅山煤矿实行民主改革，在反对封建残余分子的斗争中取得了胜利。
    该矿解放前，矿上设有国民党的区党部，封建分子不仅和国民党勾结在一起，而且他们的首领大部分本身就是美蒋特务、封建把头、帮会头子、道门头子等数位一体的分子。这些封建分子残酷地统治着工人群众，可以随便打死工人而不受法律制裁。解放后，由于该矿领导干部对接管时期原职、原薪的政策认识不正确，对矿上各种不合理的人事关系和管理制度一直没有进行改革，以致封建残余分子迄今仍然占踞着生产班长、领班等职位。全矿井下、地面五十个正副生产班长和领班中，封建把头就占了三十五个，井下十个生产班长更全部为把头分子所控制。这些封建残余分子利用职权，收留了大批逃亡的恶霸、地主、反动军官、国民党官吏（其中甚至有伪上校军官、伪县长）。他们狼狈为奸，伪装积极，混入工会，篡夺了整个矿山工会组织的领导权，并与外部土匪勾结，图谋杀害我军事代表（已破案）。当该矿行政方面提出实行安全生产时，他们煽动工人不遵守制度，不按工程规格乱挖，致使冒顶事故不断发生，大大降低了回采率。当工人开展生产竞赛时，他们百般破坏，并用各种方法窃取劳动模范的光荣称号。因此，广大工人迫切要求处理这些封建残余分子。
    今年四月进行劳动保险卡片登记时，该矿领导干部原来企图在卡片登记的审查中处理封建残余分子，但由于这种审查包括了工人阶级内部和外部各方面的问题，同时时间也受到限制，以致不能集中力量处理封建残余分子。因此，卡片登记以后，反革命分子与封建把头依然逍遥法外。直到六月初，中共中央中南局城市工作会议关于开展民主改革运动的决定下达后，该矿才专门着手民主改革工作，并以中共党委会为核心成立了民主改革委员会，统一领导这一工作。工作开始时，封建残余分子制造各种谣言，恐吓工人，并拆毁铁路，堵塞风眼，企图制造死亡事故，破坏生产。该矿领导干部针对这种情况，即选择重点，深入工人群众，揭穿封建残余分子的这些阴谋，鼓舞工人们的斗争勇气，并在工人群众中发现与培养积极分子，将各单位的积极分子组成核心小组，由他们串连群众，在每个核心小组周围又成立许多民主改革小组，这样组成了民主改革运动的核心和骨干力量。经过上述努力，并在工人群众中反复宣传了划清敌我界限以及不同情况、不同处理的政策，全矿百分之九十以上的工人随即积极起来参加斗争。全矿先后召开了两次民主改革代表会，组织了十八个按生产单位举行的斗争大会。工人群众在斗争会上控诉以后，均能按照政策，根据封建残余分子的不同情况，提出不同的处理办法。因此，所有封建残余分子都受到了应有的处分。现该矿民主改革工作正在进一步向工人阶级内部民主团结的阶段发展。
    该矿封建残余分子被处理后，工人群众的主人翁责任感大为提高，生产热情空前高涨，整个矿山已呈现出一种新的气象。在运动中虽然占用了一部分生产时间，但生产量仍较斗争前提高了百分之二十以上。运输队推煤效率由每人每天十二、三斗增至十七、八斗，创该矿有史以来的新纪录。为了保卫安全生产，工人们并自动组织了自卫队和四防（防火、防水、防偷、防破坏）小组，日夜在矿区内巡逻。
