　　Arbitrary Student Conscription by Organizations and Groups Creates Chaos in Education Across Southwest China
　　Party, government, military, and civilian organizations and groups in Southwest China arbitrarily recruit and conscript students from schools to serve as cadres, casually mobilize teachers and students to participate in various inappropriate social activities, or reside in schools and occupy them as meeting venues. This has caused extreme chaos in universities, middle schools, and primary schools throughout Southwest China, severely impacting the normal progress of school education. These organizations often recruit personnel without any organizational formalities, privately inventing names, using titles like art schools, cultural work troupes, health schools, cadre training classes, and medical training teams to openly or secretly recruit students. This has led to a sharp decline in student enrollment in various schools. According to incomplete statistics from the Southwest Cultural and Educational Department, the number of students in public and private higher education institutions in Southwest China decreased by 23% this semester compared to the previous one. The Chongqing Municipal Education Bureau, based on materials from 31 middle schools in the city, found that the number of students in these middle schools decreased by 54% this semester compared to the previous one. The Banking and Insurance Department of Chongqing University has only one student left after chaotic recruitment and conscription, while the second, third, and fourth years of the Mathematics Department have an average of only three students per grade. The senior high school graduating class of Shuren Middle School has only six students. Many organizations and groups arbitrarily mobilize students to participate in various social activities. When the Chongqing Municipal People's Court held a judicial exhibition, it mobilized more than 50 law students from Chongqing University, Zhengyang College, and Chonghua College to leave school in mid-May to participate in the exhibition's preparatory work, and then serve as explainers after the opening. They did not return to school for more than 20 days, causing the suspension of all or part of the law departments of the three institutions. Many groups frequently instruct school's Communist Youth League, Democratic Women's Federation, Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Science and Technology Popularization Association, and other organizations to arrange various activities. The Chongqing Women's Normal School once received work and activity assignments from 13 different units in a single day. The auditorium of Wende Girls' Middle School has been occupied for mass meetings more than 80 times since the beginning of this semester. The Chongqing suburban and township governments directly and arbitrarily conscript teachers from primary schools to do land reform and other work without going through the cultural and educational authorities. Cadres of Yipin Township in Ba County ordered teachers of the township's central primary school to suspend classes to participate in land reform; six of the seven teachers of the Second Central Primary School were transferred; the Third, Fourth, Seventh, and Eighth Junior Primary Schools had only one teacher each, but they were also transferred.
　　In Chengdu, Sichuan Province, taking Chengdu Normal School as an example, when it was liberated last year, the school had 422 students. After chaotic recruitment and conscription, only 169 students remained, a decrease of 60% from the original number. Only seven students remained in the two graduating classes this summer vacation. For example, the Municipal Girls' Middle School originally had 63 graduating students this summer vacation, but only 12 remained; the Municipal Boys' Middle School had only 14 students in the graduating class this year, making it impossible for the two schools to hold separate classes for this year's graduating class, so they had to merge classes. The People's Representative Conference of the Western Sichuan District and the Chengdu Municipal Democratic Women's Federation successively held meetings at Sichuan University, occupying student dormitories, classrooms, and dining halls for four weeks, forcing students to move to other places or squeeze into the library to live, and temporarily establish kitchens and dining halls. The Chengdu Art College had more than 280 students when it opened in the autumn of last year, but by this summer vacation, the school had only 186 students, and some departments did not even have a single student left.
　　In Rongchang County, eastern Sichuan, one out of every four teachers in 58 central primary schools was transferred to serve as a foreman for civilian laborers. More than 60 primary school teachers in Bishan County were transferred to work on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Fourteen teachers in Yongchuan County were transferred to teach singing to militiamen. Many classes in various middle schools in Wanxian County could not be held due to the conscription of students. For example, Wanxian Municipal Girls' Middle School had only three students in the second semester of senior high school, and only sixteen in the first semester of senior high school. The Electrical Engineering Department of the Wanxian Municipal Senior Vocational School had only three students in the third year.
　　The phenomenon of chaotic student conscription also exists widely in northern Sichuan, southern Sichuan, and Guizhou, Xikang, and Yunnan. In Guiyang Normal College, some classes had only two students left. In Ya'an, Xikang, all the students in the third year of senior high school at the Provincial Ya'an Middle School were conscripted. During one semester, the number of students recruited and transferred from Yunnan University and Kunming Normal College under various pretexts averaged one-quarter of the total number of students in each school. More than 700 students were conscripted from Yunnan University; more than 120 students were conscripted from Kunming Normal College. All the primary school teachers in the six districts of Xundian County, Yunnan, were transferred to participate in central work, resulting in the suspension of schools, which had not yet opened by May. The masses in Xundian said, "Our own government is not running schools for us anymore." The phenomenon of chaotic conscription and arbitrary mobilization of students to participate in inappropriate activities has aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses and school teachers and students.
　　In order to correct the chaotic situation in school education work in Southwest China, the Southwest Military and Political Committee and the Southwest Bureau of the CPC simultaneously issued the "Instructions on Ending the Chaotic Situation in School Education Work" on June 23, prohibiting the chaotic recruitment and conscription of students in school. However, even after the instructions were issued, some organizations and groups continued to adopt various methods to chaotically recruit and conscript students in schools.

　　机关团体任意抽调学生
    西南各地学校教育陷于混乱
    西南各地党、政、军、民机关团体任意招收与抽调学校学生充当干部，随便到学校里去动员师生参加各种不适当的社会活动，或到学校驻宿及占用学校作开会会场等，造成西南各地大、中、小学校中的极端混乱现象，严重的影响着学校教育工作的正常进行。这些机关团体的招收人员，往往不经任何组织关系，私自巧立名目，用艺术学校、文工团、卫生学校、干训班、医训队等名义，或明或暗地招收学生。这样就使各学校学生人数锐减。据西南文教部的不完全统计，西南各公私立高等以上学校学生人数，本期较上期减少百分之二十三。重庆市教育局根据该市三十一个中等学校的材料统计：本期各中等学校的学生人数较上期减少百分之五十四。重庆大学银行保险系的学生，经乱抽乱调后只剩一人，数学系二、三、四年级平均各年级只剩三人。树人中学高中毕业班只有六个人。有不少的机关、团体并任意动员学生参加各种社会活动。重庆市人民法院在举行司法展览会时，即动员了重庆大学、正阳学院、重华学院等校法律系的学生共五十多人，于五月中旬离校参加展览会筹备工作，开幕后又担任解说工作，二十多天没有回校，因而使三院校的法律系全部或部分停课。许多团体，经常指示学校的青年团、民主妇联、中苏友好协会、科学技术普及协会等等布置各种活动。重庆市女子师范学校曾在一天内接到十三个单位布置的工作和活动。文德女子中学的大礼堂，自本学期开学以来，共被占用去开群众大会达八十余次。重庆市郊区、乡政府不经过文教主管机关，直接在小学校中任意抽调教师去做土地改革及其他工作。巴县一品乡干部叫该乡中心小学教师停课参加土地改革；第二中心小学七个教师被调走六个；第三、四、七、八初级小学每校只有一个教师，但也被调走。
    在川西的成都，以成都师范为例，去年解放时，该校原有学生四百二十二人，经乱抽乱调后，只剩一百六十九人，较原有人数减少百分之六十。该校今年暑假两班毕业生只剩下七人。又如市立女中暑假毕业生原有六十三人，只剩十二人；市立男中本届毕业班只剩下十四人，以致该两校本届毕业班无法单独开班，只好合并上课。川西区各界人民代表会和成都市民主妇联接连在四川大学内开会，占用学生宿舍、课堂、饭厅，达四星期之久，学生们只好搬到其他地方或挤到图书室去住，并临时建立厨房、饭厅。成都艺术专科学校，去年秋季开学时，共有学生二百八十余人，到今年暑假，全校学生只有一百八十六人，还有的科级连一个学生也没有了。
    在川东的荣昌县，五十八个中心小学校，四个教师中被抽调一人去担任民工队长。璧山县小学教师六十余人均被调往成渝路工作。永川县十四个教师调去教民兵唱歌。万县各中学因学生被抽调，很多班无法开班。如万县市立女子中学高三下只有三个人，高三上只有十六个人。万县市立高级职业学校电机三年级只有三个人。
    乱抽乱调学生的现象，在川北、川南及贵州、西康、云南各地也普遍存在。在贵阳师范学院，有的班级只剩下两个人。在西康的雅安，省立雅安中学高中三年级的学生全部被抽空。云南大学及昆明师范学院在一个学期中，被以各种名义招走、调走的学生平均占各该校学生总数的四分之一。云南大学被抽调的学生达七百余人；昆明师范学院达一百二十余人。云南寻甸县六个区的小学教师全部被调去参加中心工作，以致学校停顿，至五月尚未开学。寻甸群众说：“自己的政府反而不给我们办学了。”乱抽乱调，以及随便动员学生参加不适当的活动的现象，引起了广大群众及学校师生的不满。
    为了纠正西南各地学校教育工作中的混乱现象，西南军政委员会及中共西南局于六月二十三日同时发布“关于结束学校教育工作中混乱现象的指示”，禁止乱招乱调在校学生。但在指示发布以后，仍有些机关团体继续采取各种办法在学校中乱抽乱调学生。（此文根据西南各地报纸上的材料写成）
