The cotton pre-purchase work entrusted by the government to cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas across the country has been preliminarily completed by the end of July. According to incomplete statistics from the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, the cooperatives in North China, East China, Northwest China, and Central South China pre-purchased a total of 4,270,000 *dan* of ginned cotton in four months (April to July), exceeding the pre-purchase quantity required by state-owned trading departments. Through the cotton pre-purchase work, the state not only secured a certain amount of industrial raw materials but also enhanced the planning of supplying needed materials to farmers. This is because, while signing pre-purchase contracts, cooperatives also accepted order forms submitted by cotton farmers based on their needs.

The cotton pre-purchase work began in various localities after the All-China Federation of Cooperatives signed an agreement with the Central Trade Department in April this year. Cooperatives in most areas attached importance to this work, actively sought assistance from local Party committees and governments, and adopted in-depth publicity and mobilization methods while closely integrating it with various other tasks, thus achieving remarkable results. For example, cooperatives in the Northwest region pre-purchased over 245,870 *dan* of ginned cotton by mid-July, exceeding the original target of 216,250 *dan*. Special districts such as Tianjin, Cangxian, Dingxian, and Tongxian in Hebei Province, as well as Shijiazhuang City, also exceeded their targets. Tianjin Special District exceeded its target by 100%, and Cangxian Special District exceeded its target by 175%.

Some cooperatives in certain areas neglected this work and therefore failed to complete their tasks. In Central South China, most cooperatives lacked specific arrangements in the pre-purchase work, completing only 12% of the task by the end of July. In Xingtai and Handan Special Districts of Hebei Province, pre-purchase efforts were relaxed due to the focus on controlling cotton aphids, resulting in some completing only half of the task and others completing just over one-third.

Due to the widespread implementation of cotton pre-purchase work, cotton farmers not only secured guaranteed sales for their products, but also received some fertilizer, grain, and other materials as advance deposits, thus boosting their production enthusiasm. In addition to generally expanding the cotton planting area, this also prompted cotton farmers to actively combat drought, control pests, and improve techniques. After signing pre-purchase contracts, villagers in Qiliying, Xinxiang, Pingyuan, successively formulated plans to "hoe ten times, spray twice, irrigate when it's dry, and treat when there are pests." Cotton farmers in Yipeng Township, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang, after the cooperative pre-purchased cotton, universally increased the amount of fertilizer applied to cotton fields during cultivation; after discovering insect infestations, the whole township organized a pest control team of 1,000 people, catching more than 69,000 cotton leaf rollers and 111 *jin* of cotton bollworms in five days.

On the other hand, precisely because the cotton pre-purchase work was carried out hastily and most cadres lacked experience, there were instances of sloppy and careless contract drafting and unrealistic acceptance of order forms. In Anguo and other places in Hebei Province, it was discovered that some farmers who had signed pre-sale cotton contracts had not planted cotton. Some cooperatives in Hebei, Pingyuan, and other places made sweeping promises when accepting cotton farmers' order forms, or completely failed to implement the order form system because they did not recognize its role in supply work. Local cooperatives at all levels are currently conducting inspections to address these situations, striving to revise or rewrite contracts during the gap before the new cotton is available, to ensure the complete fulfillment of the task.

Following the preliminary work of cotton pre-purchase—signing contracts and order forms, etc.—is the thorough preparation for cotton collection, processing, storage, transportation, and payment of materials. This is a crucial part of completing the entire cotton pre-purchase work. The Central Trade Department and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives are currently discussing and striving to sign an agreement in the short term to provide a basis for specific preparations by cooperatives at all levels.

### 各棉区合作社预购棉花工作初步完成  四个月共预购皮棉四百二十余万担  还须做好各项准备工作保证合同的完满实现

　　各棉区合作社预购棉花工作初步完成
    四个月共预购皮棉四百二十余万担
    还须做好各项准备工作保证合同的完满实现
    全国各棉区合作社接受政府委托所推行的预购棉花工作至七月底已初步完成。据全国合作总社不完全的统计，华北、华东、西北、中南四个月（四至七月）共预购皮棉四百二十七万市担，超额完成国营贸易部门要求预购的数量。通过预购棉花工作，不仅使国家掌握了一定数量的工业原料，同时还增强了供应农民需要物资的计划性。因为合作社在签订预购合同的同时，还接受了棉农根据需要而提出的订货单。
    预购棉花工作是在今年四月全国合作总社与中央贸易部签订协议以后在各地开始的。多数地区的合作社重视这一工作，主动取得当地党委、政府的帮助，同时在具体进行中采用深入宣传动员方式和密切结合各项工作，因而做出了显著的成绩。如西北区合作社在七月中旬就预购皮棉二十四万五千八百七十余担，超额完成原定二十一万六千二百五十市担的任务。河北省天津、沧县、定县、通县等专区和石家庄市也都超额完成任务。天津专区超额一倍，沧县专区超额一倍的四分之三。
    有些地区的合作社忽视了这一工作，因而没有完成任务。中南区多数合作社因为在预购工作中缺乏具体布置，截至七月底仅完成任务的百分之十二。河北省邢台、邯郸两专区因除治棉蚜而放松预购，结果有的完成任务的一半，有的完成任务的三分之一多。
    由于预购棉花工作普遍推行，棉农不仅取得产品销售的保障，同时多数棉农还得到若干作为预付定金的肥料、粮食等，因而鼓舞了他们的生产情绪。除了普遍地扩大了棉花种植面积以外，还促使棉农积极地抗旱、治虫，改进技术。平原新乡七里营在订了预购合同以后纷纷订出“锄十遍、打两次、缺雨就浇、生虫就治”的计划。浙江萧山县义蓬乡棉农，在合作社预购棉花后，在耕作中普遍的增加向棉田施肥数量；发现虫患以后全乡并组织了一千人的除虫大队，在五天中捕捉棉田卷叶虫六万九千多只，棉田红铃虫一百十一斤。
    另一方面，正因为预购棉花工作进行的匆促和多数地区干部缺乏经验，曾发生订定合同潦草、马虎和接受订货单不合实际的现象。河北省安国等地曾发现有签订预售棉花的农户没种棉花。河北、平原等地若干合作社在接受棉农订货单时大包大揽，或是因为没有认识订货单的在供应工作上的作用，而根本没有执行订货单制度。各地各级合作社正针对这些情况普遍进行检查，争取在新花上市以前的间隙时间修正或重订，以保证任务的彻底完成。
    在预购棉花初步工作——签订合同，订货单等之后，紧接着的是充分准备收棉、加工、储运及偿付物资等工作。这是完成整个预购棉花工作的重要环节。中央贸易部与全国合作总社为此正进行商讨并争取在短期内签订协议，以做各地各级合作社进行具体准备的依据。
