Anti-American Aggression and Aiding Korea General Association Note: This is a report given to the Association by the returned volunteer representatives Ji Bingqian, Li Weiying, and Zhang Fu. This report is very well written and proposes some good experiences for making anti-American aggression and aiding Korea propaganda reports. The propaganda work of the returned volunteer representatives has been very successful in various regions, and their experiences are worthy of attention from all areas.

　　During our two and a half months of work in the Southwest, we gave reports in more than sixty cities including Chongqing, Chengdu, Wanxian, Luzhou, Zigong, Ya'an, Nanchong, Guiyang, Zunyi, Kunming, Dali, Gejiu, Hekou, Lijiang, and Baoshan. The total number of listeners was over 4.1 million, and the number of people welcoming us in various places was approximately 2 million. After the reports, people in many areas launched a letter-writing campaign, conveying the content of the reports to their relatives and friends. In addition, many listeners were representatives sent by various regions to listen to the reports. If each person who listened to the report could influence one person on average, the number of people who received the propaganda in the entire Southwest would be at least over 10 million.

    During our work in the Southwest, following the instructions of the Southwest Anti-American Aggression and Aiding Korea General Sub-Association and leaders at all levels, we faced the countryside, shortened the time spent working in cities, and dispersed to small and medium-sized cities to meet with the broad masses of peasant brothers. Facts have proven that this policy is completely correct. Now, we have initially sorted out some of our experiences in the Southwest for reference by relevant parties.

    First, reports should tell more stories and provide brief and powerful analyses and syntheses of these stories, so that the general public can easily accept and digest them. We deeply feel that this approach is very good. According to our experience, everyone likes to read front-line communications from Korea and loves to hear stories of the Volunteer Army's battles. This has become an indispensable spiritual nutrient for the masses in the Anti-American Aggression and Aiding Korea movement. This education has penetrated into the most backward corners and is willingly accepted by people of all strata, becoming a force to promote all work. In the Sampu mountainous area of Wuding County, Yunnan Province, imperialism has used religion to poison the people for a long time, and work has been difficult to promote. However, after carrying out anti-American aggression and aiding Korea education, the peasants automatically rose up and drove away the imperialist elements. Anti-American aggression and aiding Korea education is the continuation and development of the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal education. We did not fully recognize this at the beginning. At the same time, the masses in various places are making rapid progress in the Anti-American Aggression and Aiding Korea movement. Therefore, simply telling a few stories cannot satisfy the needs of the masses, and just talking about the same old general principles will also make the masses feel bored. Therefore, the content of our speeches must be strictly selected and refined, and have strong ideological and educational significance.

    Second, the content of the report should be closely combined with the past suffering of the local people and their vital interests. Many people in the Southwest have personally suffered the massacres and ravages of the U.S. military. We have paid attention to understanding these situations and incorporating them into our reports. For example, when we talked about the enemy's atrocities in Korea and the suffering of the Korean people, we connected it with the suffering of the local people in the past, telling the masses: "When the Volunteer Army soldiers personally saw the U.S. military so brutal and personally saw the suffering of the Korean people, they thought of our own parents, brothers, and sisters, thought of our own homes, and thought of our past miserable days. Can we let the enemy occupy Korea, then attack China, attack our homes, and let our parents, brothers, and sisters live through those miserable days again? No, we must resolutely defeat the enemy and defend our good life." This gave the listeners a deep sense of emotion, and they immediately understood that the Volunteer Army was fighting for us Chinese people, avenging us, and that anti-American aggression and aiding Korea was for their own sake. Many people were moved to tears. Therefore, comrades who are engaged in propaganda report work must understand the situation of the masses at all times and say what the masses want to say. In this way, our reports can be full of vitality and strength, the masses can listen to them without getting tired, and we will not always feel that the content of the reports is outdated. Generally speaking, the content we talk about always lags behind the news, but as long as we can connect it with the specific situation of the masses, the material will become fresh, welcomed everywhere, and make people feel 친절 everywhere.

    Third, we must intertwine our emotions with the masses. We must not only educate the masses, but also learn from them. The people of the Southwest, especially the minority nationalities, love the motherland, love Chairman Mao, and love the soldiers who defend the motherland. The Volunteer Army soldiers on the front line are also full of love for the motherland, for the people, and for our great leader Chairman Mao. With what feelings should we narrate the stories of the front line? If it is like reciting a book, the masses will not like to listen. Therefore, we must not only understand the feelings of the soldiers, but also understand the feelings of the masses. Only when we are full of a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm can every word and every sentence we speak have power. In the course of work, we must also constantly listen to the reactions of the masses, absorb the emotions of the masses, and enrich the reports. In this work, the patriotic enthusiasm of the people in various places has given us a great education. We feel as if we have gone through a rectification campaign. The more we go on, the more we feel the arduousness of the task, because the masses love us and have high demands on us. They not only want to hear more reports, but also want to see the entire Volunteer Army from our words and deeds. The masses urge us to progress and strive to improve ourselves, and we have learned a lot from the masses. Therefore, we feel that comrades who are engaged in anti-American aggression and aiding Korea propaganda report work must first correct their own thinking, continuously learn, and continuously improve themselves in their work. Every material in the newspaper is good propaganda material. The main problem is not in the speaking skills, but in the clear political and ideological nature.

    In addition, in remote areas with inconvenient transportation, it is better to make reports in the form of representative conferences. This time, when we were working in minority areas, there were no large squares or loudspeakers, and transportation was also inconvenient. We adopted the form of holding representative conferences to report to representatives of various ethnic groups and all walks of life, and then they would convey it to the masses. However, many people hoped to meet with us. Therefore, we sometimes used a combination of large and small meetings, that is, giving a brief speech at a large meeting, and then keeping the pre-selected representatives to give a detailed report. In Guizhou, when we reported, we also used a blackboard, writing while speaking, to make it easier for them to take notes and go back to convey. The attention should be paid when reporting using this method is: to organize the attendees to discuss, so that they first deeply understand the entire content, and then combine the specific conditions of various places to study a set of methods, and know how to convey it to others after returning, and how to promote work through publicity. At present, the level of many lower-level cadres is not high, and there are not many documents. It is necessary to do so. In in-depth anti-American aggression and aiding Korea education, we suggest that various places can adopt the form of holding such representative meetings. Because our leaders cannot often go to every place to give reports, and we always have a distance from the lives and thoughts of the masses. If we get the ideas of the representatives of the masses through the representative meeting, and convey them through the forms familiar to the masses, the effect will be greater. According to our understanding of the situation in various places, all the work has been carried out very quickly in all places where representative meetings have been held.

　　提高抗美援朝宣传报告的思想性
    ——在西南区工作中的几点体会
    志愿军归国代表  嵇炳前、李维英、张甫
    抗美援朝总会按：这是志愿军归国代表嵇炳前、李维英、张甫三位同志给本会的一个报告。这个报告写得很好，提出了一些作抗美援朝宣传报告的好经验。志愿军归国代表在各地的宣传工作是做得很有成绩的，他们的经验值得各地重视。
          我们在西南工作两个半月，先后在重庆、成都、万县、泸州、自贡、雅安、南充、贵阳、遵义、昆明、大理、个旧、河口、丽江、保山等六十多个城市作了报告。听众共四百一十余万人，各地欢迎人数约计二百万人。在报告后很多地区的人民均展开一封信运动，将报告内容传达给自己的亲友。此外，许多听众是各地派来听报告的代表。如果平均每个听报告的人能影响一个人的话，这次全西南受到宣传的人数，至少在一千万人以上。
    在西南工作时，遵照了西南抗美援朝总分会和各级首长的指示，面向农村，把在城市工作的时间缩短，分散到中小城市和广大的农民弟兄见了面。这个方针事实证明是完全正确的。现将我们在西南工作中的一些体会初步整理出来，供有关方面参考。
    第一，报告应多讲故事，并对这些故事加以简短有力的分析综合，这样一般群众最易接受消化。我们深深体会到这种作法是很好的。据我们的经验，大家都喜欢读朝鲜前线通讯，爱听志愿军战斗故事，这已成为人民群众在抗美援朝运动中不可缺少的精神营养。这种教育已深入到最落后的角落里去，为各阶层人民所乐意接受，成为推动一切工作的力量。在云南省的武定县洒普山区，帝国主义利用宗教毒害人民已有长久的历史，工作很难推动；但是在进行抗美援朝教育以后，农民自动起来赶走了帝国主义分子。抗美援朝教育是中国人民反帝反封建教育的继续与发展，这是我们在开始时认识不够的。同时，各地群众在抗美援朝的运动中又突飞猛进地进步着，因此，随便讲几个故事就不能满足群众的需要，光讲老一套的大道理，群众也觉得厌烦。所以，我们讲演的内容，一定要经过严格的挑选和洗炼，有强烈的思想性和教育意义。
    第二，报告内容应该和当地群众过去曾遭受的痛苦，和当地群众的切身利益密切地结合在一起。西南各地群众，很多曾亲身遭受美军的屠杀和蹂躏，我们曾注意了解这些情况，把它溶化到我们的报告里去。比如我们讲到敌人在朝鲜的暴行和朝鲜人民的苦难时，就联系当地群众过去所受的苦难，告诉群众：“当志愿军的战士们亲眼看到美军如此残暴，亲眼看到朝鲜人民所受的苦难时，就联想到我们自己的父母兄弟姐妹，想到我们自己的家，想到过去我们悲惨的日子，我们能够让敌人占了朝鲜，再打到中国来，打到我们家里来，让我们的父母兄弟姐妹再过那悲惨的日子吗？不能，我们坚决打垮敌人，保卫我们的好光景。”这给听众的感动很深，他们立刻领会到志愿军就是为我们中国人民打仗，为我们人民报仇，抗美援朝就是为了自己，很多人都感动得流下眼泪来了。因此，我们作宣传报告工作的同志，要时时刻刻了解群众的情况，说群众心里要说的话。这样，我们的报告就能充满生气和力量，群众可以百听不厌，我们也就不会时时感到报告的内容陈旧。一般说，我们讲的内容，总是落在新闻后面的，但只要能够联系群众的具体情况，材料就会变得新鲜，到处受人欢迎，到处使人感到亲切。
    第三，我们要和群众情感交织在一起，我们不但要教育群众，同时还要向群众学习。西南人民，尤其是少数民族人民，热爱祖国，热爱毛主席，热爱保卫祖国的战士。在前线的志愿军战士，也充满了对祖国、对人民、对我们伟大领袖毛主席的热爱。我们用什么感情来叙述前线的故事呢？如果像背书一样，群众就不喜欢听了。所以，我们不但要体会战士的情感，还要体会群众的情感，自己充满着高度的爱国热诚，讲出来的每个字、每句话才有力量。在工作中间，还要不断听取群众的反应、吸收群众的情感，充实到报告里去。在这次工作中，各地人民的爱国热情，给我们的教育很大。我们感到，自己好像经过了一次整风。愈到后来，愈感到任务的艰巨，因为群众热爱我们，对我们的要求很高，他们不但要多听报告，而且要从我们的一言一行里，去看整个志愿军。群众促使我们进步，促使我们努力提高自己，我们从群众中学到了不少东西。因此，我们感到，我们做抗美援朝宣传报告工作的同志，在工作中首先必须端正自己的思想，不断学习，不断提高自己。报纸上每一篇材料都是好的宣传材料，问题主要的不在于讲话的技巧，而在于明确的政治性和思想性。
    此外，在交通不便的偏僻地区，以开代表会的形式来作报告为好。这次，我们在少数民族地区工作时，没有大的广场和扩音器，交通也不方便，我们就采取开代表会的形式，向各族各界代表作报告，然后由他们再向群众传达。但许多群众希望和我们见面，因此我们有时又用大会和小会相结合的办法，就是在大会上作简短讲话，再把预先选好的代表留下来，做详细的报告。在贵州，我们报告时还用一块黑板，一面讲一面写，便于他们做笔记回去传达。采用这种方式作报告时应注意的是：要组织到会人讨论，使他们首先深刻地领会全部内容，然后再结合各地具体情况，研究一套办法，知道回去以后如何传达给别人，怎样通过宣传来推动工作。目前许多下层干部的水平不高，文件也不多，这样作是必要的。在深入进行抗美援朝教育中，我们建议各地可以采取开这种代表会的形式。因为我们的领导干部不可能经常到每一个地方去做报告，而且我们与群众的生活、思想，总有一个距离，如果通过代表会，把群众代表的思想搞通了，通过他们用群众熟悉的形式去传达，效果就更大。根据我们在各地了解的情况，凡是开过代表会的，各项工作都开展得很快。
