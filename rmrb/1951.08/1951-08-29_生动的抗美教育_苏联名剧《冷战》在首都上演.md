　　Vivid Anti-American Education
    ——Soviet Masterpiece "Cold War" Performed in the Capital
         Qing Hua, Zhesheng
    From July 16th, the North China People's Revolutionary University Cultural Troupe began performing the Soviet masterpiece "Cold War" (by the Tur brothers, translated by Me Xun) in the capital. The play depicts how American imperialism, through its embassy in the Soviet Union, deployed special agents and spies to organize a conspiracy against the Soviet Union, to undermine peace, and to launch a new war. However, in the face of the strong Soviet people with a high degree of patriotism, this conspiracy was finally shattered.
    The performance of "Cold War" has been welcomed by the broad masses of the people. As of August 25th, it had been performed for forty consecutive shows, with an audience of over 38,000 people. Many people traveled collectively from hundreds of miles away to see the play. Many viewers, especially cadres from government agencies and military units in the capital, watched the play with a learning attitude. They received another vivid ideological education in defending peace and opposing American aggression from "Cold War."
    Viewers have written letters to the Cultural Troupe, expressing their opinions and reporting their insights after watching the play. Some units held discussion meetings after watching the play collectively. From more than twenty letters from viewers, it appears that most viewers gained a clearer understanding of the nature of American imperialism from the play. Dong Moudao of Xingye Company wrote in his letter: "After watching the drama 'Cold War,' I have a deeper understanding of the sinister and vicious nature of American imperialism, especially during the Korean armistice negotiations, when American imperialism repeatedly made unreasonable provocations, which further proves that it has no good intentions. We must be vigilant and guard against its conspiracies and tricks." The play exposed the true face of Wall Street war profiteers and their lackeys. The counselor of the American Embassy in the Soviet Union in the play is a typical example. He was an accomplice of Hitler. During World War II, he sold aluminum to German aircraft factories through countries such as Sweden, and he represented Churchill in negotiations with Germany to establish a secret anti-Soviet alliance. For the sake of making money, he did everything possible to engage in the criminal work of opposing the Soviet Union and undermining peace. He and his accomplices conspired to restore the spy network inside and outside Germany. In order to eliminate the evidence of their collusion with Hitler, he also wanted to buy off Soviet officers and set fire to the houses where Soviet officers lived. Later, he also arranged a conspiracy to slander the Soviet Union. All of this illustrates the fanaticism of imperialist elements in pursuing war. The viewer Li Liuhua concluded from this: "The Wall Street bosses and the Hitler bandits are birds of a feather."
    On the other hand, the audience saw the strength of the world's people in defending peace from the drama. The strong will and actions of the Soviet Major Koshtalov and his son in loving their country and defending peace, and the awakening of the American people Grant Yeva, who had been deceived by the war profiteers, shattered the conspiracy of American imperialism to launch a new war, and drove the war profiteers away in disgrace. Many viewers felt that this was "a great relief." However, the play also tells the audience that peace must be strived for with great efforts. One viewer wrote in a letter to the Cultural Troupe: "Cold War" makes us better know how to defend peace." Another viewer wrote: "The Soviet major and the major's father (the old painter) in 'Cold War' educated me. Regardless of the enemy's threats and inducements, they showed their infinite loyalty to the revolution and to the motherland. These moving facts made me realize how to sacrifice personal interests and obey the interests of the motherland in specific issues." Cadres from a certain agency said after watching the play: "The most profound impression 'Cold War' gave us is that we must be vigilant at all times and never have 'pigtails' for the enemy to grab; a little carelessness will lead to the danger of being used by the enemy to undermine the motherland." Here, "Cold War" played a role in educating the broad masses of the people on how to defend peace. The power of peace-loving people all over the world is invincible. The Soviet major in the play told the audience: "...In the account of peace and freedom, there are tens of millions of Chinese men and women, millions and millions of Italians, French, and countless people!..." The will and actions of these countless people cannot be hindered or destroyed by the conspiracies of the imperialists. The major vividly quoted a proverb from Uzbekistan: "The dog keeps barking, but the camel caravan still moves forward."
    The performance of "Cold War" is beneficial to our people's great movement to resist America and aid Korea. It is hoped that literary and art workers in various places will carry out more literary and art activities with rich anti-American content.

　　生动的抗美教育
    ——苏联名剧《冷战》在首都上演
         青华　哲生
    从七月十六日开始，华北人民革命大学文工团在首都演出苏联名剧《冷战》（屠尔兄弟著，么洵译）。剧本写的是美帝国主义利用它的驻苏大使馆，布置特务间谍，组织了一个反对苏联，破坏和平，发动新战争的阴谋，可是，在坚强的具有高度爱国精神的苏联人民面前，这一阴谋终于被粉碎了。
    《冷战》的演出，获得了广大人民的欢迎。到八月二十五日为止，连续演出了四十场，观众超过三万八千人。许多人从百里以外集体赶来看戏。许多观众，特别是首都的机关和部队干部，他们是抱着学习的心情来看戏的。他们从《冷战》中又受到了一次生动的保卫和平反对美国侵略的思想教育。
    观众纷纷写信给文工团，表示他们的意见和报告观剧后的心得。有的单位人员在集体观剧之后，并举行了座谈会。从二十多封观众来信看来，大部分观众从剧本中更清楚地认识了美帝国主义的本质。兴业公司董谋道在信里写道：“在我看了话剧《冷战》以后，我更深刻地了解了美帝国主义的阴险毒辣，尤其在朝鲜停战谈判期间，美帝国主义一再无理挑衅，更证明了它是不怀好意的。我们要提高警惕，严防它的阴谋诡计。”剧中揭露了华尔街战争贩子们以及他们的走狗的真面目。剧中美国驻苏大使馆的参事就是一个典型。他是希特勒的同谋者。在第二次世界大战中，他曾通过瑞典等国把铝卖给德国的飞机厂，曾代表邱吉尔和德国进行过建立秘密反苏同盟的谈判。为着自己赚钱，他千方百计地做着反对苏联、破坏和平的罪恶工作。他和他的同谋者阴谋恢复德国国内外的间谍网。为了消灭他们自己与希特勒勾结的罪证，他又想收买苏联军官，又想放火烧毁苏联军官住的房子。后来还布置了一个诬蔑苏联的阴谋。这一切，就说明了帝国主义分子追求战争的狂热。观众李流华从此得到了一个结论：“华尔街老板与希特勒匪徒原是一丘之貉。”
    另一方面，观众从话剧里看到了全世界人民保卫和平力量的强大。剧中苏军少校科什塔洛夫父子热爱祖国、保卫和平的坚强意志与行动，受过战争贩子欺骗的美国人民格兰特·耶娃的觉醒，粉碎了美帝国主义发动新战争的阴谋，把战争贩子打得狼狈逃窜。许多观众都觉得这是“大快人心的事”。但是，话剧又告诉观众，和平是要以极大的努力去争取的，一位观众在给文工团的信里写道：“《冷战》使我们更好地知道如何保卫和平。”另一位观众写道：“《冷战》中的苏军少校和少校的父亲（老画家）教育了我。他们不顾敌人的威胁利诱，表现了对革命、对祖国的无限忠诚。这些动人的事实，使我认识到怎样在具体问题上牺牲个人利益，服从祖国利益。”某机关的干部，在观剧之后说：《冷战》给我们印象最深的一点，就是要时时刻刻提高警惕，千万不要有“小辫子”给敌人抓住；稍一麻痹，便有被敌人利用来破坏祖国的危险。在这里，《冷战》就起了教育广大人民如何来保卫和平的作用。全世界爱好和平人民的力量是无敌的。剧中的苏军少校告诉观众：“……在和平和自由的账上，有千万、万万的中国男子和妇女，百万、千万意大利人、法国人，无数的人！……”这无数人的意志与行动，不是帝国主义者的阴谋所可能阻挠破坏的。少校生动地引用了一句乌兹别克斯坦的俗话：“狗尽管在叫，骆驼队仍旧向前跑。”
    《冷战》的演出，对我国人民伟大的抗美援朝运动是有益的。希望各地文艺工作者，更多地开展这种富有抗美内容的文艺活动。
