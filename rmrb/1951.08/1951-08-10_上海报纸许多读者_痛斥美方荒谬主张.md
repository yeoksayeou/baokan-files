Xinhua News Agency report:

　　Shanghai's *Liberation Daily* and *Xinwen Daily* have received many letters from readers who angrily denounce the U.S. side's absurd proposal to demarcate the military demarcation line, expressing their determination to strive for peace with even greater efforts. A letter from reader Hu Ruirong published in the *Liberation Daily* said: The absurd and outrageous proposal made by the United States regarding the demarcation of the military demarcation line is a deliberate attempt to create a deadlock and attempt to delay or even sabotage the negotiations. We are extremely indignant about this! Let me tell the American imperialists frankly: We have already made concessions on some issues, and today we will never make concessions on the issue of the military demarcation line; because we are determined to demand peace, and this absurd proposal is precisely endangering peace. Reader Wang Youling pointed out in his letter: The U.S. side's unreasonable troublemaking is another face painting for the U.S. imperialists, allowing the people of the world to once again recognize the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism.

    痛斥美方荒谬主张
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上海解放日报、新闻日报收到了许多读者来信，这些读者都愤怒地斥责美方所提划分军事分界线的荒谬主张，表示要以更大的努力争取和平。解放日报发表的读者胡瑞荣的来信说：美国所提的关于划分军事分界线的荒谬绝伦的主张，是故意制造僵局，企图拖延以至破坏谈判。我们对此感到无比的愤慨！老实告诉美帝国主义者：我们在某些问题上已经作了让步，今天在军事分界线的问题上，我们绝不再作让步了；因为我们是坚决要求和平的，而这种荒谬主张正是危害和平的。读者王幼龄的信中指出：美方这样无理取闹，是美帝国主义者再一次为自己画了一个脸谱，让全世界人民再一次认清了美帝国主义的侵略本质。
