Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th: According to TASS, Berlin: Delegations from various countries participating in the World Youth and Student Festival for Peace held gatherings on the 11th and 12th to further strengthen the friendship between youth from different nations and their unity in the struggle for peace.

	Youth textile workers from China, Korea, Germany, various People's Democratic countries, and capitalist countries held a gathering on the 11th. The gathering was very enthusiastic and fully demonstrated the unity of the working class from all countries around the world in the movement for peace.

	The Soviet youth delegation held gatherings with delegations from sixteen Latin American countries and German youth on the 12th. On the 11th, the Indian youth delegation and the Soviet youth delegation held a gathering. The Indian youth introduced their struggle for peace and thanked the Soviet people for providing food to the people in the disaster areas of India. Musicians from both countries performed at the meeting.

	The meeting between French and Vietnamese youth was particularly moving. Cherou, the secretary of the French Republican Youth League, said in a speech at the meeting: "The French people oppose the war in Vietnam, and French progressive youth will do their utmost to fight for peace." The youth present unanimously shouted slogans such as "Restore peace in Vietnam" and "Release Martin." French and Vietnamese youth warmly embraced and shook hands. Their unity gave a serious warning to the French reactionaries and American interventionists who are waging a shameful war in Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th: Dentsu News Agency, Berlin, 15th: The Korean delegation participating in the World Youth and Student Festival for Peace held a gathering with the youth delegations from the United States, Britain, and Canada. This was one of the most moving gatherings of the festival. The American, British, and Canadian youth solemnly pledged at the meeting that they would do everything possible to stop their governments' policies of aggression in Korea. Youth representatives from the four countries exchanged gifts at the meeting, demonstrating the unity of peace-loving youth.

	The meeting began with a speech by an African-American young woman who said: The American delegates are attending the festival with a desire for peace and friendship with the Korean people. We pledge to continuously expose the true nature of American imperialism's aggression in Korea. Another American youth spoke about the struggle of the peace-loving people of the United States and the activities of the American Peace Crusaders in this struggle. He said: The struggle of the American people under the leadership of the American Peace Crusaders has had a great impact on the American government's agreement to hold Korean armistice talks. He concluded amidst warm applause: "We believe that we, together with the people of all countries in the world, will certainly be able to defend peace."

	A Canadian representative said: We say that the Korean War must be stopped, representing the will of the vast majority of the Canadian people.

	When the Korean representative stood up to speak, a burst of warm applause greeted him. He said: "Anyone who has been to Korea and seen the devastation it has suffered would not believe that the Korean delegation and the American delegation in Berlin could meet in a friendly atmosphere. In northern Korea, there is not a single city or village that has not been destroyed; hardly anyone has not lost their loved ones. The Korean people remember the atrocities of the American interventionists with hatred. However, the Korean people clearly distinguish between the American people and the American interventionist army. They know that these atrocities were committed by the American imperialists, not the American people. It is the American imperialists who should be held responsible for these atrocities and crimes."

	At this point, the entire audience stood up and shouted slogans such as "Long live peace! Restore peace in Korea!" and "American soldiers get out!" The Korean representative concluded by emphasizing: "If the Korean War continues, it will only cause more bloodshed and suffering to the American and Korean people. The Korean people love peace, and the Korean government has always been willing to resolve the issue peacefully. As long as American imperialism is willing to solve the problem peacefully, the problem can be solved immediately. If they are unwilling, the Korean people are prepared to defend themselves and fight for independence." The speech ended with thunderous cheers from the audience.

	The British representative spoke next, saying that he was speaking on behalf of every peace-loving and sensible person in Britain. He said: "We realize that the Korean people are fighting for peace, and the vast majority of the British people realize the unjust nature of the war being waged by the United States and Britain, and more people have begun to turn this understanding into action." He called on Americans, Britons, and Canadians to do everything possible to end the Korean War.

	After the delegations exchanged gifts, a young Korean female guerrilla fighter recounted her experiences and why she took up arms to defend her country. Youth representatives from the four countries freely engaged in conversations, and finally, Canadian and American youth representatives performed artistic programs.

    苏联青年代表团于十二日和拉丁美洲十六国的代表团及德国青年分别举行了联欢会。十一日，印度青年代表团和苏联青年代表团联欢，印度青年介绍了他们进行争取和平的斗争的情况，并感谢苏联人民以粮食供给印度灾区人民。会上两国青年音乐家表演了节目。
    法国和越南青年的会晤特别令人感动，法兰西共和青年联盟书记舍鲁在会上发表演讲说：“法国人民反对越南战争，法国进步青年将竭尽全力为和平而斗争。”与会的青年一致高呼“恢复越南的和平”、“释放马丁”等口号，法国青年和越南青年热烈地拥抱握手。他们的团结给了正在越南进行可耻的战争的法国反动派和美国干涉者一个严重的警告。
    【新华社十六日讯】电通社柏林十五日讯：参加世界青年与学生和平联欢节的朝鲜代表团，和美国、英国、加拿大青年代表团举行了联欢会，这是联欢节中最动人的集会之一。美、英、加青年在会上郑重保证他们要尽一切力量制止他们的政府在朝鲜的侵略政策。四国青年代表在会上互相交换礼物，表现了爱好和平的青年的团结。
    会上首先由一个美国黑人女青年致词，她说：美国代表是怀着热望和平并且与朝鲜人民友好的心情来参加联欢会的。我们保证不断揭露美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略行为的真实性质。另一个美国青年讲述了美国爱好和平的人民的斗争情形和美国和平十字军在这个斗争中的活动。他说：在美国和平十字军领导下的美国人民的斗争，对于美国政府同意举行朝鲜停火谈判有很大的影响。他最后在热烈的掌声中说：“我们相信我们和全世界各国人民在一道，一定能够保卫和平。”
    一个加拿大代表说：我们说必须停止朝鲜战争，是代表了加拿大绝大多数人民的意志的。
    朝鲜代表起立发言时，一阵阵热烈的掌声向他致敬。他说：“任何人只要到过朝鲜，见过朝鲜遭受摧残的情形，就不会相信在柏林朝鲜代表团和美国代表团能够在友好的气氛下相会。在朝鲜的北部，没有一个城市一个村庄没有经过破坏；几乎没有一个人没有失去自己的亲人。朝鲜人民怀着仇恨的心记住美国干涉者的暴行。但是，朝鲜人民把美国人民和美国的干涉军队分得很清楚。他们晓得这些暴行是美帝国主义者而不是美国人民做出来的。是美帝国主义者应负这些暴行和罪恶的责任。”
    此时听众全体起立，高呼“和平万岁！朝鲜恢复和平！”“美国兵滚回去！”等口号。朝鲜代表最后着重说：“如果朝鲜战争继续下去，只有使美国人和朝鲜人民流更多的血，受更多的痛苦。朝鲜人民爱好和平，朝鲜政府一直是愿意和平解决问题的。只要美帝国主义愿意用和平方法解决问题，则问题立刻能够解决。如果他们不愿意，朝鲜人民已准备好保卫自己，为独立而战。”演讲结束时，全场报以雷鸣般的欢呼。
    英国代表继起发言，他说他是代表英国每一个爱好和平与明白事理的人发言的。他说：“我们认识到，朝鲜人民正在为和平而战，绝大多数的英国人民认识到美、英进行的战争的非正义性，并且有更多的人已开始把这种认识化为行动。”他号召美国人、英国人和加拿大人尽一切的力量来结束朝鲜战争。
    在代表团互相交换礼物之后，一个朝鲜女青年游击队员讲述了她的经验和她为什么拿起武器来保卫祖国。会上四国青年代表自由地进行交谈，最后并由加拿大与美国青年代表演出了文艺节目。
