To the Editor:

Our factory's bookbinding worker, Yang Xiuzhi, invented and created the "automatic bookbinding machine," which has been reported in detail by the People's Daily and the Worker's Daily. After Yang Xiuzhi proposed this plan, the Party Committee of our factory specifically helped him overcome difficulties and encouraged and strengthened his confidence in creation. After listening to Yang Xiuzhi's creative plan, we encouraged him to first make a prototype using waste cardboard and wood shavings, and then invited Dong Weiliang, a mechanical engineer from Xinhua Printing Factory, to come to the factory to assist in the research. The Standing Committee of the Management Committee also listened to Yang Xiuzhi's report and conducted in-depth research, believing that it was in line with mechanical principles and had the possibility of success. Therefore, after formal discussion, the Management Committee decided to let Yang Xiuzhi leave production to manufacture a wooden model, and allocated 3 million yuan for expenses. From mid-November of last year to the end of February of this year, a total of more than 10 million yuan was spent. The model has been created, and future work is beyond the capacity of our factory's manpower and financial resources. We need to request assistance from the Central Bureau of Technical Administration. However, the bureau has shown a perfunctory and bureaucratic attitude towards this, causing Yang Xiuzhi's invention to be interrupted.

We have carefully read the "Decision of the Government Administration Council on Rewarding Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production" published in the People's Daily on August 17 last year, as well as the editorial on the same day. Therefore, we decided to request assistance from the Central Bureau of Technical Administration through the Worker's Daily. The bureau sent comrades Liu Huandong and Meng Guangzhao to the factory at the end of March to check the model. On the spot, they expressed admiration and praise for Yang's invention and creation, believing that it could be established in principle and that it was the most complete of all the models they had seen. They also said that they would do their best to request support from higher authorities after returning. On April 21, we received a reply from the Central Bureau of Technical Administration forwarded by the Worker's Daily. The article began by saying: "The bookbinding model made by Yang has achieved considerable results and is incomparable to ordinary workers. It is truly admirable and worthy of praise." Then it said: "Although the machine is feasible in principle, the mechanism is automatic and must be carefully studied to avoid being rough and wasting manpower and material resources." Since it is considered "feasible in principle" and needs "careful research," then it should be actively helped and supported; however, the latter part of the reply said: "Automatic bookbinding machines are not available in various factories in China. It is already difficult for China's current printing industry to have separate bookbinding machines. The research on continuous automatic working machines can be slightly delayed."

The decision of the Government Administration Council clearly stipulates: "...organize research and experimentation for inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals that are of great significance and have the possibility of being realized...." However, the Central Bureau of Technical Administration did not adopt the attitude of "organizing research and experimentation," but adopted the attitude of "delaying" and shelving it, which is obviously inconsistent with the spirit of the Government Administration Council's decision. Saying a few words of "truly admirable and worthy of praise" is not equivalent to valuing the inventions and creations of the working class. We believe that the reply from the Central Bureau of Technical Administration emphasized the country's economic difficulties and reminded us to be satisfied with the status quo. It is already difficult for the current printing industry to have separate bookbinding machines. Why invent automatic "bookbinding machines"? If this conservative view is not corrected, it will hinder the inventions and creations of the working class, and the impact on China's industry is also conceivable.

After we submitted the above opinions to the Central Bureau of Technical Administration in writing, the Worker's Daily forwarded the second reply from the bureau on May 11. Although it claimed to "send experts to study again," its focus was on unilaterally extracting individual words and phrases from Article 5 of the Government Administration Council's decision on encouraging inventions and creations, believing that "attention must be paid to preventing a bias, that is, rashly engaging in trial production without careful research and due experimentation, resulting in waste of national property."

It is strange that the Central Bureau of Technical Administration has not actively launched assistance, nor has it organized research and experimentation. How can it be afraid of rashly engaging in trial production? The fifth article of the Government Administration Council's decision refers to "rashly engaging in trial production without careful research and due experimentation," which is only "a bias that should be prevented when encouraging and assisting work is actively launched." The Central Bureau of Technical Administration has not encouraged and assisted worker Yang Xiuzhi in creating inventions. How can it prevent bias now? We believe that the bias lies in, as the Government Administration Council's decision pointed out at the beginning, "some competent authorities have failed to pay due attention to this important work," which is a serious neglect of workers' inventions and creations.

Until late May, the Central Bureau of Technical Administration sent comrades Liu Huandong and Meng Guangzhao to the factory for the second time to check the model, but still did not raise any negative opinions, believing that the principle was feasible. They promised to return to the bureau for instructions and told us to wait for processing. However, there was no reply until the end of June. I called Comrade Meng Guangzhao and he said: "This matter needs to be reviewed by the review committee before a decision can be made." When asked whether the review committee was established, he replied, "It is being established." When asked when it could be established, he replied: "It is still difficult to determine." This really makes us feel bewildered and depressed, not knowing what to do.

It is worth mentioning that the General Administration of News and the trade union system and the vast number of workers are very concerned about this invention. The General Administration of News has organized comrades from the National Newspaper Conference to visit the model, and finally solemnly transferred this invention to the General Administration of Publications for assistance (because the bookbinding machine is much more useful for printing books than printing newspapers). Administrative staff and workers in the printing industry in Shenyang, Harbin, Baoding, and other places wrote letters to encourage Yang Xiuzhi and asked if the bookbinding machine had been completed. Workers from the Zhengzhou Railway Administration Printing Factory organized a visiting group to visit the model in Beijing. They also presented Yang Xiuzhi with a banner. When they saw the first reply from the Central Bureau of Technical Administration, they expressed dissatisfaction and jointly wrote a letter to the Central Bureau of Technical Administration to express their opinions (this letter is still kept at the Worker's Daily), fully supporting Yang Xiuzhi. From this, it can be seen how much the working class loves the country's industrial construction, how much they value inventions and creations, and how they eagerly hope for early success with joyful and encouraging feelings.

The General Administration of Publications accepted the opinions of the General Administration of News, sent the Xinhua Printing Factory to organize a visiting group to study the model and submit a report, and instructed to hold a symposium for experts and staff in the publishing and printing industry, and invited mechanical engineers from the Central Bureau of Technical Administration to participate in the guidance. Our factory convened this symposium on July 25 in accordance with the instructions. The following unanimous opinions were reached at the meeting: (1) This machine will definitely succeed, and the publishing industry is in urgent need of it. The model needs to be improved. (2) Please organize Yang Xiuzhi to visit the existing various binding machines in major printing factories in the Northeast and Shanghai, and after returning, the General Administration of Publications will provide assistance in terms of manpower and financial resources to trial-produce an experimental machine. Comrade Chen Jianzhong, representative of the General Administration of Publications, said at the meeting that he would ask for instructions after returning to the Administration and strive to resolve it quickly.

At the symposium, representatives from various factories expressed their strong support, and unanimously agreed: If the government cannot afford the economic expenditure, then factories across the country can gather together to help Yang Xiuzhi complete this major invention.

At this meeting, the Central Bureau of Technical Administration's participants were still comrades Liu Huandong and Meng Guangzhao. They fully agreed that the General Administration of Publications should provide specific assistance in research and experimentation in terms of manpower and financial resources, but did not express how the Central Bureau of Technical Administration should assist at all. Their reason is: the bureau "has more than 200 cases of accumulated inventions and creations, and it is really unable to solve them one by one. The Invention Review Committee is actively preparing to be established." In this way, more than 200 inventions and creations sent from all over the country have been "temporarily" shelved. If this situation is not vigorously improved, the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers for inventions and creations will inevitably be stifled!

We urgently hope that relevant agencies will earnestly assist Yang Xiuzhi in research and experimentation, so that this invention and creation will not be abandoned halfway, and that the new automatic bookbinding machine will be born soon.

中共华北军区政治部印刷厂委员会书记 Jiang Ping, Secretary of the Printing Factory Committee of the Political Department of the North China Military Region

Editor's note: The leadership of the Printing Factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region is completely correct in actively supporting Yang Xiuzhi's creation.

The Central Bureau of Technical Administration's attitude of indifference, perfunctoriness, and irresponsibility towards this creation is incorrect. Although the Central Bureau of Technical Administration also gave some reasons, we believe that these reasons are not valid. For example, they believe that: It is already difficult for the current printing industry to have separate bookbinding machines. Why invent automatic bookbinding machines? This is obviously an outdated conservative idea. They also proposed to prevent the bias of "rashly engaging in trial production" and "causing waste of national economic resources," but in fact, they delayed and shelved the workers' creations and inventions for as long as five or six months, without giving practical processing and reply. According to the staff of the Central Bureau of Technical Administration, the bureau has accumulated more than 200 cases of mass inventions and creations. According to comrades Liu Huandong and Meng Guangzhao of the Bureau, it is "really unable to complete them one by one." We believe that the problem lies in whether the Bureau treats these mass inventions and creations with high enthusiasm and maximum effort.

The conservative thinking of being satisfied with the existing technical and production level, and the style of not valuing workers' inventions and creations and being irresponsible for workers' creations, are sharply pointed out in the Government Administration Council's "Decision on Rewarding Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production" and in this newspaper's editorial entitled "Earnestly Reward Creations and Inventions in Production and Construction," and it explains the harm it causes to today's national economic construction. However, after a year, this kind of erroneous ideological style still exists. This should arouse our serious attention. The Central Bureau of Technical Administration, as well as agencies and public and private enterprises with similar errors, should thoroughly examine and correct this erroneous ideological style.

　　中央技术管理局对工人杨秀芝的发明创造应采取积极支持的态度
    编辑同志：
    我厂装订工人杨秀芝发明创造“自动装订机”事，人民日报与工人日报已有详细登载。杨秀芝提出这一计划后，我厂党委会曾具体帮助他排除困难，鼓励和坚定他的创造信心。我们在听取了杨秀芝的创造计划后，就鼓励他利用废马粪纸和木头木屑先制一个雏型，后又请新华印刷厂机械工程师董维良来厂帮同研究。管委会常委也听取了杨秀芝的报告，并作了深入研究，认为尚符合机械原理，有成功可能。因此，管委会经过正式讨论，决议让杨秀芝脱离生产，制造木质模型，并拨给经费三百万元。从去年十一月中旬至今年二月底完竣，共用去一千多万元，模型已经造成，今后工作已非我厂人力、财力所能解决，需请求中央技术管理局予以帮助。但该局对此却表现了敷衍应付的官僚主义态度，使杨秀芝的发明陷于中断。
    我们曾详读人民日报去年八月十七日登载的“政务院关于奖励有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的决定”及当日社论，故确定经由工人日报向中央技术管理局请求帮助，该局于三月底派刘焕东、孟广照二同志来厂查看模型，当场他们对杨的发明创造表示钦佩与赞扬，认为原理上可以成立，是他们看到所有模型中较完整的一个，并表示回去后当极力向上级请求支持。四月二十一日接到工人日报转来中央技术管理局的复文，文中一开始就说：“杨所制装订模型，已有相当成绩，非普通工作者所可比拟，实堪钦佩表扬”。接着又说：“该机在原理上虽属可行，而以机构系属自动，必须精细研究，以免粗枝大叶，空耗人力物力。”既然认为“原理可行”，又需“精细研究”，那就应积极帮助与支持；但复文后段却说：“自动装订机在国内各厂均无设备，以我国现在印刷工业能有单独工作之订书机使用即觉不易，要研究连续自动的工作机，尚可稍缓。”
    政务院的决定中明文规定：“……对于意义重大且有实现可能的发明、技术改进与合理化建议，组织研究与实验……。”而中央技术管理局不是采取“组织研究与实验”的态度，却采取了“暂缓”搁置的态度，显然与政务院决定的精神不符。说上几句“实堪钦佩表扬”的话，并不等于重视工人阶级的发明创造。我们认为中央技术管理局的复文中强调了国家经济的困难，并提醒我们要满足现状，现在印刷工业能有单独工作之订书机使用即觉不易，何必发明自动“装订机”呢？这种保守观点如不纠正，会阻碍工人阶级的发明创造，对中国工业的影响也是可想而知的。
    我们把以上意见用书面向中央技术管理局提出后，五月十一日工人日报又转来该局二次复文，虽然声称“再派专家研究”，其重点却在于片面地摘取政务院关于鼓励发明创造决定中第五条中个别字句，认为“须注意防止一种偏向，即不经过仔细研究和应有的实验过程而贸然从事试制，以致浪费国家的财物”。
    很奇怪，中央技术管理局并未积极展开协助，又没有组织研究和实验，怎么却害怕贸然从事试制呢？政务院决定第五条所指，“不经过仔细的研究和应有的实验过程而贸然从事试制”，这只是“在鼓励、协助工作积极展开的时候，应注意防止的一种偏向。”中央技术管理局没有鼓励协助工人杨秀芝创造发明，现在怎么防止起偏向来了？我们认为偏向正在于如政务院决定开头就指出的，是“有些主管机关对此项重大工作未能予以应有的注意”，就是严重地忽视工人的发明创造。
    直至五月下旬中央技术局又派刘焕东、孟广照二同志二次来厂查看模型，仍未提出否定意见，认为原理可行。并允再回局请示，嘱我们等待处理。但直到六月底尚无答复。我即打电话问孟广照同志，他说：“这事需请审查委员会审查，才能决定。”问他审查委员会是否成立，则答“正在成立中”。再问他何时可成立，则答：“尚难确定。”真使我们傍徨苦闷，不知所措。
    值得提出的是新闻总署和各工会系统与广大职工是非常重视这一发明的，新闻总署并曾组织全国报业会议的同志来厂参观模型，最后又郑重地将这一发明转请出版总署协助完成（因装订机对印书比印报用处大得多）。沈阳、哈尔滨、保定等地印刷界的行政和职工来信鼓慰杨秀芝，并问装订机做好了没有。郑州铁路管理局印刷厂职工组织参观团，专门来北京参观模型。并给杨秀芝献锦旗。当他们看到中央技术管理局第一次复文时，表示不满，曾联名写信向中央技术管理局提出意见（此信现仍在工人日报社留存），全力支持杨秀芝。由此可看出工人阶级是如何热爱祖国的工业建设，如何重视发明创造，以欢欣鼓舞的心情渴望早日成功。
    出版总署接受了新闻总署的意见，派新华印刷厂组织参观小组，来厂研究模型后提出报告，并指示召开出版、印刷界专家和工作人员座谈会，请中央技术管理局派机械工程师参加指导。我厂于七月二十五日遵照指示召开了这个座谈会。在会上得出一致的意见：（一）此机器一定能成功，目前出版事业亦迫切需要。模型部分须改进。（二）请出版总署组织杨秀芝到东北、上海各大印刷厂参观现有各种装订机器，回来后，即由出版总署在人力财力上给予协助，试制一部实验机器。出版总署代表陈健中同志，在会上表示回署后请示，争取迅速解决。
    在座谈会上各厂代表都表示大力支持，一致意见：如政府在经济上不能支出，则全国各厂可集腋成裘，帮杨秀芝完成这一重大发明。
    在这次会上，中央技术管理局参加座谈会的仍是刘焕东、孟广照二同志，他们完全同意由出版总署在人力财力上具体帮助研究实验，却丝毫没有表示中央技术管理局应如何帮助。他们的理由是：该局“积压发明创造的案件有二百余件，实无力一一解决。发明审查委员会正积极筹备成立中。”这样说来，全国各地送来的二百多件发明创造都被“暂缓”搁置。这种情况如不大力改善，则广大工人对发明创造的热情必被窒塞！
    我们迫切地希望各有关机关切实协助杨秀芝研究、实验，使这种发明创造不致前功尽弃，使自动装置的新装订机早日诞生。
                     中共华北军区政治部印刷厂委员会书记  江萍                            
    编者按：对杨秀芝的创造，华北军区政治部印刷厂领导方面积极支持，是完全正确的。
    中央技术管理局对这个创造表现了冷淡、敷衍、不负责任的态度，是不对的。尽管中央技术管理局也讲了一些理由，我们认为这些理由都不能成立。例如：他们认为：现在印刷工业能有单独工作的装订机使用即觉不易，何必发明自动装订机呢？这显然是一种陈腐的保守思想。他们又提出防止“贸然试制”、“造成国家经济浪费”的偏向，而实际上是拖延、搁置工人的创造发明达五、六个月之久，不给以切实处理和答复。据中央技术管理局工作人员自称，该局积压的群众发明创造的案件，有二百余件之多。按照该局刘焕东、孟广照二同志的说法，是“实无力一一完成”。我们认为问题在于该局是不是以高度热情、最大努力对待这些群众的发明创造。
    满足于既有的技术、生产水平的保守思想，及不重视工人创造发明、对工人的创造不负责任的作风，在政务院颁布的“关于奖励有关生产的发明，技术改进及合理化建议的决定”，与本报以“切实奖励生产建设中的创造和发明”为题的社论中，都尖锐地指出了，并说明了它对今天国家经济建设的危害。但时隔一年，而此种错误思想作风仍然存在。这应引起我们严重注意。中央技术管理局，以及存在有类似错误的机关、及公私企业，应彻底检查、纠正此种错误思想作风。
