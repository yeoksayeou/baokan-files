　　The Shanghai Native Products Exhibition and Exchange Fair closed on the 11th, playing a significant role in the struggle to smash the imperialist "economic blockade." Of the native and specialty products produced in the East China region in 1950, totaling 20 trillion yuan, 20 percent remained unsold in May of this year. After the exhibition and exchange fair, over 90 percent were sold, increasing the income of farmers and handicraft producers in the region by 2 trillion yuan.

    The Shanghai Native Products Exhibition and Exchange Fair played a significant role in the struggle to smash the imperialist "economic blockade" of our country. The Shanghai paper-making industry, which had always used imported wood pulp as raw material, ordered bamboo pulp and bark pulp worth 34.4 billion yuan from Jiangxi and northern Anhui, basically solving the raw material supply problem for China's paper-making industry, which has seen significant development since liberation. Other examples include Guangdong Guangcao, which can replace imported steel wire cloth, and northern Jiangsu mica, which can be processed to replace imported Qingke paper. These all enhanced the confidence of industrialists and businessmen in independently developing production. Many native and specialty products that had previously relied on foreign markets also found a vast domestic market through this fair. For example, domestic sales of Fujian umbrellas during the fair exceeded the total annual exports of the previous year by 35.2 percent. At the same time, this fair not only restored many commercial relationships that had been interrupted for one or two decades, but also enabled many native and specialty products from remote areas and domestic ethnic minorities to find a vast domestic market.

    The domestic sales situation of native products at the Shanghai Native Products Exhibition and Exchange Fair clearly showed two new trends in native product exchange: First, many handicrafts that meet the needs of the domestic market, such as Fujian umbrellas and horn combs, and southern Jiangsu yellow grass woven products, experience a supply shortage once sales channels are opened. Therefore, it is necessary to organize handicraft producers in a planned way to increase production. Second, due to the fact that most or all of the various native products in the East China region have been sold, it is generally estimated that most native and specialty products will increase by at least 10 percent this year compared to last year. Therefore, the purchasing power of rural people in the second half of this year and next spring will increase by at least 2 trillion yuan. It is extremely urgent and important to fully prepare for the rural supply work after the increased agricultural and native and specialty products harvest this autumn.

    The Shanghai Native Products Exhibition and Exchange Fair was also a powerful patriotic political education for the broad masses of people. A total of 3.05 million visitors from this city and all over the country visited the fair. They all had a concrete and profound understanding of the greatness, loveliness, and abundance of resources of the motherland, and the hard work and intelligence of the Chinese working people. Yin Yongxin, a combat hero of a certain corps of the People's Liberation Army, said in a broadcast speech to the conference after the visit: "We live in such a great and lovely motherland, and we feel infinite glory and infinite pride. I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, and from now on, I will not hesitate to contribute everything, stand at the forefront of national defense, and fight to the end to defend the great and lovely motherland."

    The Northwest Military and Political Committee's Finance and Economics Committee held a summary meeting on the region's native product exchange work from July 26 to 31. The meeting pointed out that all provinces, cities, special districts, and counties in the Northwest region have generally held native product conferences and native product exhibitions since April; the Trade Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, Xi'an City, and the Qinghai Provincial People's Government have all sent native product exchange visiting groups, and signed more than 500 native product exchange contracts and agreements with commercial circles in East China and Central South China, exchanging a total value of more than 250 billion yuan in native products; many slow-selling native products have thus opened up sales channels. However, according to preliminary investigations, there are a total of 455 kinds of major native and specialty products in the Northwest region, of which only more than 60 kinds are selling well, accounting for about 40 percent of the total output; more than 380 kinds of slow-selling and semi-slow-selling native products still account for about 60 percent of the total output. The meeting studied the situation of the vast territory and inconvenient transportation in the Northwest region, and recognized the importance of vigorously organizing mass transportation forces. For example, Qinghai's salt and Xinjiang's raisins, alum, and melon products are all affected by high transportation costs, which affects sales. Although various places have begun to use existing folk transportation tools to transport native products in the past six months, it is still not very common. The meeting decided to promote water transportation, organize mule carts, repair necessary mountain trails, and give full play to the transportation power of the masses. Secondly, in order to solve the difficulty that the prices of many native products in the Northwest are too high, which affects sales, the meeting decided that state-owned trading companies must correctly grasp regional price differences and seasonal price differences, adhere to the principle of small profits but quick turnover, and take care of the interests of production, transportation, and sales.

　　在粉碎帝国主义“经济封锁”的斗争中起了重大作用
    上海土产展览交流大会闭幕
    西北财经委员会召开会议总结半年来土产交流工作
    上海市土产展览交流大会已于十一日闭幕。华东全区一九五零年度所产总值二十万亿元的土、特产品，今年五月时有百分之二十还没有销出，经过展览交流大会，百分之九十以上已经销出。全区农民和手工业生产者增加了两万亿元收入。
    上海市土产展览交流大会在粉碎帝国主义对我国“经济封锁”的斗争中，起了重大的作用。一向采用进口木浆作原料的上海造纸工业，向江西、皖北订购了价值三百四十四亿元的竹浆、皮浆，基本上解决了解放后已有很大发展的我国造纸工业的原料供应问题。他如广东广草可以代替进口钢丝布，苏北云母加工后可以代替进口货青壳纸等，这些都提高了工商业者独立自主发展生产的信心。一向依赖外国市场的许多土、特产，也通过这次大会找到了广大的国内市场。例如，福建雨伞在大会期间的内销量即超过去年全年外销总量百分之三十五点二。同时，这次大会不但恢复了许多中断一、二十年的商业关系，而且使许多边远地区和国内少数民族的土、特产也开始找到了广大的国内市场。
    上海市土产展览交流大会上的土产内销情况，明显地显示了土产交流的两种新趋势：一是适应国内市场需要的许多手工业品，如福建的雨伞、角梳，苏南的黄草织品等，一经打开销路就发生供不应求的现象。因此，必须有计划地把手工业者组织起来，增加生产。一是由于华东区各种土产大部或全部销出，一般估计一九五一年度多数土、特产品至少将比去年增产一成。因此，今年下半年和明春农村人民的购买力至少将增加二万亿元以上。充分准备好今秋农业和土、特产增产后的农村供应工作，极为迫切重要。
    上海市土产展览交流大会对广大人民也是一个有力的爱国主义政治教育。参观大会的本市和全国各地观众共达三百零五万人。他们都具体地、深刻地认识到祖国的伟大、可爱、物产丰富，和我国劳动人民的勤劳聪明。人民解放军某兵团战斗英雄印永鑫在参观后向大会广播演讲说：“我们生活在这样伟大可爱的祖国，感到无限光荣、无限骄傲。我是人民解放军的一个战士，今后我决不惜贡献一切，站在国防的最前线，为保卫伟大可爱的祖国而奋斗到底。”

    西北军政委员会财政经济委员会在七月二十六日到三十一日召开全区土产交流工作总结会议。会议指出：西北区各省、市、专区、县四月份以来普遍举行了土产会议和土产展览会；西北军政委员会贸易部、西安市和青海省人民政府都曾派出土产交流参观团，和华东、中南各地商业界订立土产交流合同和协议五百多件，交流土产总值二千五百多亿元；不少滞销土产已因此打开销路。但同时据初步调查，西北全区主要土、特产共有四百五十五种，其中畅销的土产只有六十多种，占总产量的百分之四十左右；滞销和半滞销的土产仍有三百八十多种，占总产量的百分之六十左右。会议研究了西北区地域辽阔和交通不便的情况，认识到大力组织群众运输力量的重要。如青海的盐，新疆的葡萄干、碯砂、瓜干等，都因运输成本太高，影响销路。半年来各地虽已开始使用民间原有交通工具运输土产，但还是很不普遍。会议决定提倡水运，组织骡马大车，整修必要的山区栈道，充分发挥群众运输力量。其次，为了解决西北不少土产因产地价格太高而影响销路的困难，会议决定国营贸易公司必须正确掌握地区差价和季节差价，坚持薄利多销，照顾产、运、销三方面利益的原则。（新华社）
