　　State Council's Financial and Economic Committee
    Instructions on Improving and Strengthening Basic Construction Planning

    In 1950, the Central People's Government began making substantial investments in various state-owned economic sectors nationwide. Construction units made significant efforts in construction work and achieved some results. However, serious shortcomings and even severe waste still existed in this work. Based on a few simple summaries of basic construction work in 1950, the total amount of work completed this year only accounted for about 60 to 70 percent of its financial expenditure. As for how much production capacity has increased, it is impossible to estimate because the leading departments have not conscientiously conducted inspections and summaries. In 1951, the Central People's Government again made substantial investments in various state-owned economic sectors. As of June, the cumulative total of appropriations had reached 72 percent of the total investment (averaging 63 percent for the industrial and transportation departments). As for how much work has been done in total and how much production capacity has been put into use, some units are still unclear.

    The above situation shows that our basic construction work is still very unsound. Our leadership over basic construction work is also extremely inadequate.

    The purpose and task of basic construction are to accelerate the development of the people's economy and increase production capacity (i.e., increase output). Therefore, basic construction work is the most fundamental part of the people's economy and a heavy and meticulous task. To ensure that this work fulfills its due tasks, we must quickly overcome the existing chaotic situation and strive to improve and strengthen leadership. To this end, the following instructions are issued:

    (1) Conduct design work conscientiously and strictly prohibit blind construction. The correct working procedure for basic construction is to conduct investigation and research on the construction object first, propose necessary steps, verify accurate data, then conduct design, and finally, after approval by the leadership, commence construction. Currently, the general situation of basic construction is that design lags behind the needs of construction. Some design and construct simultaneously; some construct first and design later; some have already started construction and then realize that the design data is insufficient or incorrect, and then conduct investigations, completely violating the basic construction procedure. The result is a large amount of blind construction or constant rework, seriously wasting state resources. This is an unacceptable and egregious phenomenon. Therefore, it is reiterated as follows: (1) For all new construction projects, the main construction and installation work must not be started until the design has been approved by the competent authority, except for preparatory work required for construction. (2) All new units that lack sufficient or accurate design data should continue to collect the data needed for design and must not proceed with design hastily. (3) For those who have started construction without approved design, a comprehensive inspection should be carried out in accordance with the Commission's June 19 notice (see the People's Daily, June 20), and the inspection results should be reported to the Commission.

    (2) Quickly compile a summary report of the 1950 work. In order to gain experience and learn lessons, all central financial and economic departments that carried out basic construction work in 1950 should, without exception, quickly compile annual summary reports (which must include and separately list the investment amount, total workload, production capacity put into use, and fixed assets of each construction unit, as well as materials and cash remaining at the end of the year). These should be sent to the Commission before August 31.

    (3) Correctly grasp the total workload of the 1951 plan. The basic link in the basic construction plan is to grasp the workload. Therefore, the basic construction plan for each department in 1951 must be compiled according to the workload using the People's Economic Plan forms issued by the State Council, and financial budgets must not be used as the workload. This will put our 1951 basic construction plan on the right track and lay a correct foundation for the 1952 planning work.

    (4) Check the implementation of the 1951 plan. What is the progress of the basic construction plan for 1951 from January to the end of June? How much work has each construction unit actually done? Each department must carry out the inspection of basic construction work based on the periodic statistical reports of basic construction issued by this Commission on June 28 (51) Finance and Economics Plan (Statistics) No. 1877 and compile semi-annual comprehensive reports and written explanations, and send them to the Commission at one time before August 31. At the same time, through this inspection, a regular and systematic inspection and supervision system should be established. If this report is not submitted within the time limit, appropriations will be suspended as appropriate from September.

    (5) Correct and timely revise the annual plan. All central financial and economic departments that have basic construction this year should, based on the periodic reporting materials of each construction unit from January to June, convene a meeting of the basic construction responsible persons of each construction unit in September to conduct an inspection of the basic construction work. The original plan for this year must be accurately revised. All workloads that are expected to be uncompleted by the end of December this year should be included in the 1952 plan, and the required funds should also be reclassified into the next year's budget. After the plan is revised, except for the necessary pre-purchase of equipment costs, the construction funds for this year will only be allocated according to the workload that can be completed this year. Unfinished projects from the previous year are not allowed to be listed in addition to the basic construction control figures for 1952.

    The central ministries must submit this revised plan to the Commission before the end of September (those who do not need to revise it should also report to the Commission at the same time). If it is not submitted within the time limit, the construction funds from October will be suspended, and the minister of each department shall be responsible for the project losses caused thereby.

                                              Director Chen Yun
                                        August 10, 1951

### 政务院财政经济委员会  关于改进与加强基本建设计划工作的指示

　　政务院财政经济委员会
    关于改进与加强基本建设计划工作的指示
    一九五○年，中央人民政府开始在全国范围内，对各个国营经济部门作了大量的投资。各个建设单位，在建设工作中曾作了很大的努力，并取得了某些成效。但在这一工作中仍然存在着严重的缺点以至严重的浪费情事。依据一九五○年基本建设工作几个简单的总结材料来看，今年所完成的工作总量，仅约占其财务支出的百分之六十至七十。至于生产能力增加了多少，因各领导部门没有认真负责地进行检查与总结，而无法估算。一九五一年度，中央人民政府对各个国营经济部门，又作了大量的投资，截至六月份止，拨款累计总数已达投资总数的百分之七十二（即以工业、交通各部而论，平均亦达百分之六十三）。至于工作总量已做了多少？生产能力已使用上了多少？有些单位还不甚明了。
    以上情况，说明我们的基本建设工作还是很不健全的。我们对基本建设工作的领导也是极不够的。
    基本建设的目的与任务，是为加速人民经济的发展与增加生产能力（即增加产量），因之基本建设工作是人民经济中最基本的一部分，同时，也是一件繁重与细致的工作。我们要使这一工作完成其应有的任务，就必须迅速地克服现有的混乱情况，并力求改善与加强领导工作。为此，特作如下指示：
    （一）认真地进行设计，严禁盲目施工。基本建设正确的工作程序，是对建设对象先进行调查研究，提出必需的经过，考证正确的资料，再进行设计，然后经过领导上批准，始能施工。目前基本建设的情况，一般是设计落后于施工的需要。有的一面设计，一面施工；有的先施工后设计；有的已经施工了，方感到设计资料的不足或不正确，再去进行调查，完全违反了基本建设的程序。其结果是大量地造成盲目施工或不断翻工，严重地浪费了国家的资财，这是不能允许的恶劣现象。为此，特再重申决定如下：（１）一切新建工程、设计未经主管机关批准前，除建设所需的准备工作外，其主要建筑安装工程，一律不得施工。（２）一切新建单位，因设计资料不足或不正确者，继续收集设计所需要的资料，不得草率进行设计。（３）设计未经批准已经施工者，一律应依据本委六月十九日的通知（见六月二十日人民日报）进行一次检查，并将检查结果报告本委。
    （二）迅速编制一九五○年度工作总结报告。为取得经验教训，中央财经各部凡在一九五○年度进行过基本建设工作者，应无例外地迅速编制年度总结报告（必须包括并分列各建设单位的投资数、工作总量、开始使用的生产能力与固定资金，以及年终结存的材料与现金等）。并于八月三十一日前送达本委。
    （三）正确掌握一九五一年计划的工作总量。基本建设计划的基本环节，是掌握工作量。因此，各个部门一九五一年的基本建设计划，必须依照政务院颁发的人民经济计划表格编制工作总量，不得以财务预算当作工作量。这样才能使我们一九五一年的基本建设计划步入正轨，并为一九五二年的计划工作奠定正确的基础。
    （四）检查一九五一年计划的执行情况。一九五一年度的基本建设计划，一至六月底进行情况如何？各建设单位的工作到底做了多少？各部须依据本委六月二十八日（５１）财经计（统）字第一八七七号指示所颁发的基本建设定期统计报表，进行基本建设的检查工作并编制半年的综合报表及文字说明，于八月三十一日前一次寄送本委。同时经过这次检查，应建立起经常的系统的检查与监督制度。凡此项报表未依限送达者，自九月份起即酌情停止拨款。
    （五）及时地正确地修正年度计划。中央财经各部凡本年有基本建设者，应依据一至六月份各建设单位的定期报告材料，于九月份内召集各建设单位的基本建设负责人员，开一次基本建设工作的检查会议。对今年的原定计划，必须正确地进行一次修正。凡预计今年十二月底不能完成的工作量，应一律编入一九五二年计划中，其需款也随之改列入下年度预算。计划修正后，除必需的预购器材费用外，今年的工程用款，只按今年能完成的工作量拨给。在一九五二年的基本建设控制数字之外，不准再列上年未完工程项目。
    此项修正计划，中央各部须于九月底前送达本委（无须修正者，亦应同时报告本委）。凡未依限送达者，自十月份起之工程用款，一律停付，其因此而引起的工程损失，应由各部部长负责。
                                              主任  陈云
                                        一九五一年八月十日
