　　Xinhua News Agency, New York Dispatch from Radiopress: "New York Times" reporter Barrett admitted in a dispatch from Seoul on the 22nd that the illegal actions and "disrespectful behavior" of the United Nations forces have "caused great hatred among the vast Korean residents of Seoul, and these residents seem to have transgressed by talking about the good character of the Chinese." He revealed that on March 17th, three Canadian soldiers broke into a Korean family, attempting to rape two women inside the house. Eventually, the Koreans broke free and drove the soldiers away. As the soldiers retreated, someone threw in a grenade, killing three people in the house and injuring one.
　　Xinhua News Agency, August 25th, Dispatch from TASS, Copenhagen, August 24th: Danish doctor Rojel, currently working in South Korea, wrote an article in "Policy Newspaper" discussing the plight of millions of Koreans who have been violently driven from their homes.
　　In his article, he described the situation of a "hospital" in South Korea. This "hospital" is located in a county south of the Han River.
　　The author said: Due to the simplicity of the equipment, the hospital turns into a swamp after heavy rain. Six or seven hundred patients, sheltered by things resembling shacks, lie or sit on the ground and on straw mats. Their bodies emit a bad smell. In corners separated by straw mats live patients with smallpox. Most of them are children. Their faces are disfigured because of large pustules. Another area houses people suffering from typhus and dysentery. In addition, there are those suffering from tetanus and leprosy. Everything is in chaos. Many patients suffer from severe edema due to hunger. The author said: "This 'hospital' is a mockery of humanity and civilization. It is a disgrace to the United Nations."
　　Schou, the director of the Danish Red Cross who recently visited South Korea, confirmed the facts cited in Rojel's article. Schou also emphasized that these facts are consistent with what Red Cross employees have seen in South Korea. Schou pointed out: "In South Korea, the military authorities are the ruling power. In their activities, they only proceed from war considerations and pay no attention to civilians."

　　美《纽约时报》记者承认
    汉城人民仇视美国侵略军
    丹麦医生报道南朝鲜人民惨况
    【新华社讯】据电通社纽约讯：《纽约时报》记者巴瑞特在二十二日自汉城发来的消息中承认：联合国军的违法行为和“轻侮的表现，已经在汉城广大的朝鲜居民中引起极大的仇恨，这些居民似乎有谈论中国人的好品行的越轨举动了”。他透露：有三个加拿大士兵在三月十七日，撞入一个朝鲜家庭，企图侵犯屋内的两名妇女。最后朝鲜人挣脱了，并赶走了这些兵士。当这些兵士退出时，有人扔进去一颗手榴弹，炸死了屋里的三个人，炸伤了一个人。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社哥本哈根二十四日讯：目前在南朝鲜工作的丹麦医生罗耶尔在“政策报”上撰文，论述数百万被暴力逐出家园的朝鲜人的境况。
    他在文章中描述了南朝鲜的一个“医院”的情形。这个“医院”在汉江南面的一个县份里。
    作者说：由于设备的简陋，下过大雨后，医院就变成了沼泽。六、七百病人在类似窝棚的东西的遮蔽下，躺在或坐在地上和草席上。他们的身上发出恶劣的气味。在用草席隔开的角落里，住着患天花的病人。他们大多是儿童。他们的面孔因为生了大浓疮，已经不成形了。另一个地方是患斑疹伤寒和痢疾的人。此外，还有患破伤风的和麻疯病的。所有的东西混乱不堪。许多病人因为饥饿而患着严重的虚肿。作者说：“这个‘医院’对人道与文明是一个讽刺。它是联合国的耻辱。”
    最近曾访问南朝鲜的丹麦红十字会主任邵克证实了罗耶尔的文章中所引述的事实。邵克并强调说：这些事实与红十字会雇员在南朝鲜所见到的情形相符合。邵克指出：“在南朝鲜，军事当局是统治的势力。在他们的活动中，他们只从战争考虑出发，一点也不注意平民。”
