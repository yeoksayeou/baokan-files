Editor's Note: The seventh session of the People's Representatives Conference of all circles in Yushe County, Shanxi Province, has exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress. The main reason why the People's Representatives Conference of the county was successful was that cadres were organized before the meeting to study documents on democratic governance, link them with practical work, correct the closed-doorism thinking of some cadres, and strengthen cadres' understanding of the People's Representatives Conference as a basic national system. At the same time, the election of representatives and the handling of proposals were taken seriously, and the people's democracy was promoted, which enhanced the people's representatives' awareness of being masters of their own affairs and improved the political enthusiasm of the people's representatives. We believe that Yushe's experience is worthy of attention in various places.

Yushe County, Shanxi Province, has convened seven county people's representative conferences of all circles from October 1949 to the end of June this year. The county is an old liberated area, and the people's political consciousness and organizational level are relatively high, and the work foundation is strong. In particular, the county's leadership attaches great importance to democratic construction, and has convened people's representative conferences of all circles on time. Each meeting has generally been successful. Therefore, the county's most recent people's representative conference of all circles has exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elected the county head and members of the county People's Government Committee. The center of this meeting was to pass the government's semi-annual work report and arrange two plans for summer work and sustained and in-depth resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea. At the same time, it made resolutions on donations, preferential treatment, and the promotion of patriotic conventions. At the same time, through the above central work, the county's democratic construction work has taken a major step forward, mainly reflected in the full promotion of democracy before and after the meeting, further strengthening the relationship between the people and the government; making general cadres realize that the government's work should not only be responsible to the higher authorities, but also to the people, and the unity of the two.

The main reasons why the People's Representatives Conference of all circles in the county, which exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, was successful, in addition to the fact that the objective conditions were already mature, are as follows:

First, eliminating the closed-doorism thinking among cadres is one of the important keys to the success of the meeting. Although the general cadres of the county already know that the People's Representatives Conference is the best way for the government to contact the masses, implement policies, and promote work, they do not have a deep understanding of the point that this is "our country's basic system, the best basic organizational form of the united front and the people's democratic regime," and some cadres still have many confused ideas. For example, they think that "it is troublesome to hold representative meetings," "it is like a deaf person's ears - a decoration like the past parliamentary meetings"; some think that "Yushe is an old liberated area, it is enough to do a good job in farmers' work, it doesn't matter what the united front is"; some think that "the higher authorities need it, but the lower authorities don't"; and individual comrades look down on businessmen and democratic people. In short, some comrades have closed-doorism thinking such as complacency and thinking that "we won the world." In order to overcome this deviation, the county organized cadres to study documents related to democratic construction from May, and County Head Hou gave two study reports to county and district organs, organized group discussions, and conducted self-criticism in light of actual work. In particular, everyone thought that Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement that "they are accustomed to a few people monopolizing everything, and are not accustomed to discussing things with the people's representatives" was really "the right medicine" and had a deep understanding, which enlightened democratic ideological awareness and thus strengthened democratic style.

Second, the election of representatives was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the "Organizational Regulations for County People's Representative Conferences of All Circles" of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council, and closely combined with the current political situation, and carried out full publicity and education to the masses in advance, so the representatives were more widespread and representative. Whether in the large or small meetings of the People's Representatives Conference of all circles, the representatives competed to speak, enthusiastically discussed, and dared to responsibly criticize the work. The county specifically convened a district head meeting, asking them to return to the district and convene village head meetings to specifically educate village cadres on the nature and tasks of the People's Representatives Conference and the exercise of the functions and powers of the People's Congress, and arranged for mobilizing the masses, collecting proposals, and electing representatives. The county also conducted publicity and education on the three major patriotic calls and democratic construction work in the county's propagandist training class, finance and grain cadre meeting, labor model meeting and primary school teacher meeting, and midwifery training class, and convened a forum of representatives of the last People's Representatives Conference by district, educating the representatives and publicizing to the masses. Through these powerful efforts, the patriotic ideology of the people of the county, their understanding of the people's democratic dictatorship, and their emphasis on the election of representatives have all been improved. The general list of candidates was put forward after deliberation and discussion in piece meetings or group meetings. The method of producing representatives, except for party, group, and organ representatives who were elected by their respective units, regional representatives and occupational representatives were elected directly or indirectly by show of hands according to the population and residential situation. In individual places, voting and bean-throwing were also used under the voluntary conditions of the masses. Through such a serious and democratic election, the representatives were in high spirits and felt that they were responsible, so all the representatives attended the meeting on time, overcoming the phenomenon that some people were absent without reason. In particular, they can seriously discuss the government's work report and put forward criticisms, truly playing the role of the people in managing the government. For example, some representatives criticized the government for not fully publicizing the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; some criticized the government for "saying that it is the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, but doing it is the families of workers, soldiers, and martyrs." Some blamed the grain depot for the moldy grain, saying: "You don't think it's anything, but it's all made with our blood and sweat!" Some representatives were afraid to criticize at the beginning, but finally spoke, such as saying: "I have concerns about saying this, but I represent the masses, and in order to help the government improve its work, I have to say it." Everyone felt that this meeting was more progressive than the previous ones, "In the past, no one would say anything even if it was arranged, but today's meeting is endless."

The county's election of the county head and government committee members also gave play to the spirit of democratic consultation. The list of candidates was proposed by the representative groups for discussion, submitted to the presidium of the meeting, which decided on 25 candidates, and then distributed to the representative groups for deliberation and discussion. Finally, the presidium determined the official list of candidates based on the results of consultation with the chief representatives of each group, and submitted it to the congress for election. However, there were some shortcomings in the election of representatives in the county this time. There were no representatives from the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, and individual representatives were retaliated against and failed to be elected because they had reflected on the bad behavior of village cadres. This phenomenon should be quickly corrected. (Editor's Note: All unreasonable retaliatory acts should be thoroughly investigated and punished to protect the democratic rights of representatives.)

Third, the handling of proposals from previous meetings is relatively serious. The county collects the opinions of representatives in advance before each meeting, and has issued proposal papers since the sixth meeting. The method of handling proposals is to first form a proposal sorting group composed of the standing committee and government departments to classify, sort out and study them in advance, and put forward preliminary handling opinions. After the People's Representatives Conference is held, a proposal review committee is formally established to review it, and then submit it to the presidium for research and decision. Important issues are submitted to the congress for discussion, and general issues are dealt with by way of answers at the congress. Every case is explained, and the representatives and the masses are satisfied, believing that the representative meeting is useful, and the number of proposals has gradually increased (a total of 754 proposals in the past six meetings, and 363 proposals in the seventh meeting). However, the county submits very few proposals to the congress for discussion, and actually takes answering as the only method of handling proposals. Moreover, the handling situation of proposals from the last meeting is rarely reported at the next meeting, and the answers to the proposals were also relatively crude at the seventh meeting due to the large number of agendas. This should be paid attention to and overcome in the future.

Fourth, the standing committee of the county people's representative conference of all circles has a sound organization, which communicates the connection between the representatives and the government, and can assist the representatives in completing the transmission of the resolutions. Since the establishment of the standing committee elected at the first meeting, the organization has been gradually improved through continuous improvement. The Standing Committee has established a system of answering all questions and a semi-monthly communication system, and actively writes to representatives who do not write letters. Each committee member also contacts representatives by district, and takes advantage of various opportunities to talk with representatives. In the past 20 months, the Standing Committee has received 1,137 letters from representatives and 82 interviews, involving a total of 2,203 questions, and most of the problems reflected are correct. The handling of letters from representatives takes two methods: (1) For matters that need to be dealt with or suggestions, the Standing Committee transfers them to the relevant government departments; (2) For general matters or matters that only need explanation, the Standing Committee directly answers them. The Standing Committee has also established a letter handling inspection book and a proposal registration book with the government, inspecting them once every half month, and also stipulated: "Letters from representatives must be answered in a timely manner, no more than two days for the Standing Committee and no more than three days for the county government." In addition, it also selected several villages as key villages for contacting representatives, convened representative forums, and helped representatives convey resolutions. After the county's Standing Committee adopted these measures, the opinions reflected by the representatives were resolved in a timely and appropriate manner, improving the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the representatives, enhancing the prestige of the People's Representatives Conference among the masses, and strengthening the relationship between the government and the people.

　　山西省榆社县二届一次人民代表会议为什么能够开好？
    编者按：山西省榆社县的第七次各界人民代表会议，已代行了人民代表大会的职权。该县人民代表会议所以能够开好的主要原因，在于会前组织干部学习民主建政的文件，联系实际工作，纠正了某些干部的关门主义思想，加强了干部对人民代表会议这个国家基本制度的认识。同时，对于代表的选举，提案的处理，都很认真，发扬了人民的民主，这样就增强了人民代表们主人翁的自觉，提高了人民代表的政治积极性。我们认为榆社的经验，值得各地重视。
    山西省榆社县自一九四九年十月到今年六月底，已召开了七次县各界人民代表会议。该县是老解放区，人民的政治觉悟和组织程度都较高，工作基础较强，特别是县的领导上对民主建政工作较重视，做到了按时召开各界人民代表会议，每次会议一般地都还开得好，因此该县最近一次的各界人民代表会议已代行了人民代表大会的职权，选举了县长和县人民政府委员会的委员。这次会议的中心，是通过政府半年工作报告和布置夏季工作及持久深入抗美援朝的两个计划，同时作出关于捐献、优抚、推行爱国公约的决议，同时通过以上中心工作，该县的民主建政工作向前推进了一大步，主要表现在会议前后充分地发扬了民主，进一步地密切了人民与政府的关系；使一般干部也认识到，政府的工作不仅要对上级负责，同时还要对人民负责，两者的统一性。
    该县这次代行人民代表大会职权的各界人民代表会议所以开得好，除了客观条件已经成熟外，还有下面几个重要原因：
    第一、清除干部中的关门主义思想，是使会议开得成功的重要关键之一。该县一般干部虽然已经知道人民代表会议是政府联系群众、贯彻政策和推动工作的最好方式，但对于这是“我们国家的基本制度，是统一战线与人民民主政权最好的基本的组织形式”一点，体会尚不深刻，并且有些干部还存在着许多糊涂观念。例如，认为“开代表会麻烦”，“和过去的参议会一样，聋子的耳朵——配搭。”；有的认为“榆社是老解放区，做好农民工作就可以了，无所谓统一战线”；有的认为“上边需要它，下边不需要”；还有个别同志看不起商人和民主人士。总之，一部分同志存在着居功自满、以为“天下是我们打下来的”等关门主义思想。为了克服这种偏向，该县从五月份开始即组织干部学习有关民主建政的文件，侯县长给县、区机关干部分别作了两次学习报告，组织小组讨论会，结合实际工作，进行检讨。特别是对于刘少奇副主席所说的：“他们习惯于少数人包办一切，而不习惯于和人民的代表商量办事”，大家都认为这句话真是“对症下药”，领会深刻，启发了民主思想觉悟，因而加强了民主作风。
    第二、代表的选举，执行了中央人民政府政务院“县各界人民代表会议组织通则”的规定，并密切结合当前的政治形势，在事前向群众进行了充分的宣传教育，因而代表的广泛性和代表性都较充分。无论在各界人民代表会议的大小会上，代表都争先发言，热烈讨论，敢于负责地批评工作。该县曾专门召开区长会议，要他们回去以后以区为单位召开了村长会，专门向村干部进行了人民代表会议的性质、任务与代行人民代表大会职权的教育，并布置了发动群众，搜集提案和选举等工作。该县还在全县的宣传员训练班、财粮干部会、劳动模范会和小学教员会以及助产训练班等单位，进行关于三大爱国号召和民主建政工作的宣传教育，又按区召开了上次人民代表会议代表座谈会，教育代表并向群众宣传。经过这些有力的推动，全县群众的爱国主义思想，对于人民民主专政的认识，以及对于选举代表的重视，都提高了一步。一般的候选名单都是在片儿会或小组会上酝酿讨论后才提出来的。代表产生的方法，除党派、团体、和机关代表由各单位自行推选外，区域代表和职业代表，均按人口居住的情况，采用直接选举或间接选举，以举手表决的方式产生的，个别地方在群众自愿条件下也有投票和投豆的。经过这样严肃认真和民主自由的选举，代表情绪很高，觉得自己负了责任，所以全体代表均按时到会，克服了有些人无故缺席的现象。特别是对于政府的工作报告，都能认真讨论，提出批评，真正发挥了人民管理政权的作用。例如，有的代表批评政府镇压反革命未完全做到大张旗鼓；有的批评政府对优抚工作“说的是烈、军、工属，做的却是工、军、烈属。”有的责备粮库中粮食霉烂说：“你们觉得没啥，这可都是我们一滴血一滴汗打的呀！”有的代表开始不敢批评，也终于发了言，如说：“我说这话有顾虑，但我代表群众，为了帮助政府改善工作，不能不说。”大家都觉得这次会议比以往几次进步了，“过去是布置也没有人说，今天开会说不完。”
    该县此次县长和政府委员的选举，也发挥了民主协商精神。候选名单由各代表小组讨论提出，交会议主席团，由他们决定二十五名候选人，然后再发到各代表小组酝酿讨论，最后才由主席团根据与各组首席代表协商的结果，确定正式的候选名单，提交大会进行选举。不过该县此次代表的选举也存在着一些缺点，没有烈、军、工属充当代表，而且有个别代表因曾反映村干部的不良作风而遭到报复而落选，这种现象是应迅速纠正的。（编者按：对一切不合理的报复行为，应彻查议处，以保障代表的民主权利。）
    第三、对于历次会议提案的处理比较认真。该县在每次会议召开前均事先收集代表的意见，从第六次会起并制发了提案纸。处理提案的方法是先由常委会与政府各部门组成提案整理组，事先加以分类整理和研究，提出初步处理意见。人民代表会议开会后，再正式成立提案审查委员会，进行审查，然后交主席团研究决定，凡重要问题提交大会讨论，一般问题采取大会解答方式。做到案案有交代，代表群众均满意，认为代表会顶事，提案逐次增多（过去六次会共七百五十四件，第七次会有三百六十三件），不过该县提交大会讨论的提案甚少，实际上把解答作为处理提案的唯一方法，而且上次会议提案的处理情形，很少在下次会上提出报告，而第七次会议则因议程较多，对提案的解答也较粗糙。这是今后应注意克服的。
    第四、县各界人民代表会议常务委员会的组织健全，沟通了代表与政府之间的联系，并能协助代表完成决议案的传达。自第一次会议选举成立了常委会后，经不断改进，组织已逐步健全起来。常委会建立了有问必答制度，半月通讯制度，对不来信的代表主动去信联系。各委员又分区联系代表，利用各种机会和代表谈话。二十个月来，常委会共收到代表来信一千一百三十七件，面谈者八十二人，共谈问题两千二百零三个，所反映问题绝大部分是正确的。代表来信处理采取两个办法：（一）凡需处理或建议的事项，由常委会转政府有关部门；（二）属于一般性或只需要解释的问题，由常委会直接答复。常委会并与政府建立了来信处理检查簿和提案登记簿，半月检查一次，还规定：“对代表来信必须及时答复，常委会不超过二日，县政府不超过三日”此外，并选择了几个村为联系代表的重点村，召开代表座谈会，帮助代表传达决议。该县常委会采取这些办法后，使代表反映的意见得到及时而适当的解决，提高了代表的积极性和责任心，增强了人民代表会议在群众中的威信，密切了政府与人民的关系。
