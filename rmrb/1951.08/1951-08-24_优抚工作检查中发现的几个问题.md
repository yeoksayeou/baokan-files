Several Problems Discovered During the Inspection of Preferential Treatment Work
       Preferential Treatment Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government

The inspection campaign for preferential treatment work launched around the "August 1st" Army Day, thanks to the attention of local leading organs and the organization of forces from all sides for inspection, has been carried out relatively universally and deeply in most regions, mobilizing the masses and setting off a wave of support for the army and preferential treatment for families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs.

The inspection methods adopted by various regions mainly include the following four types. One is to hold meetings, including: preferential treatment symposiums with the participation of various departments, civil affairs meetings or preferential treatment work meetings with the participation of civil affairs cadres at all levels, enlarged county cadre meetings, representatives of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs or model meetings (some models of support for the army and preferential treatment for families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs also participated), joint meetings of representatives of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs and civil affairs cadres or representatives of substitute farming households, etc. These meetings played a role in mobilizing and educating the masses, and could also reflect some situations and conduct a certain degree of inspection of preferential treatment work, but it was not easy to be comprehensive and in-depth. The second is to have higher-level organizations form inspection teams to go to various places for key inspections, or conduct comprehensive inspections of one county, district by district, village by village, household by household. This approach can arouse local attention to preferential treatment work, help leading organs understand the situation, and discover problems; but it is necessary to mobilize the strength of the masses to form a movement to improve the work in a timely manner. The third is to mobilize the forces of all aspects within a county to conduct a comprehensive inspection. For example, in Taian County, Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China, an inspection team of 1,462 people, including district and village cadres, families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, and model workers, was organized to conduct inspections from house to house in each village. This approach is very good, but if a higher-level inspection team can provide guidance and assistance, the results will be even greater. The fourth approach is to notify all villages to conduct inspections at the same time. However, due to the different working foundations of each village, the depth of inspection also varies. Some did a very good job, with representatives and cadres personally going to the fields to observe the crops of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, and mobilizing everyone to help solve the difficulties of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs; some did a poor job, only conducting a cursory inspection by cadres. To prevent this unevenness, some places first concentrated village cadres to inspect one or two villages to gain experience, and then each returned to their villages for inspection.

The results of inspections in various regions have not yet been fully summarized, but based on the existing materials alone, it can be seen that our preferential treatment work has achieved great results this year due to the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and the two relatively universal inspections in various regions since September last year and this year's Spring Festival. In general, more attention has been paid to the political status of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs in various regions, and attention has been paid to absorbing them to participate in various meetings and work. For example, in Changsha City, Hunan Province, two family members of soldiers were elected as provincial people's representatives, four were elected as municipal people's representatives, and 500 participated in the work of government agencies and state-owned enterprises. In Taian County, Heilongjiang Province, families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs accounted for 487 county and township people's representatives and 259 county and township government members. Various places have continuously convened meetings of representatives of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, representatives of model families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, or symposiums. Zhejiang Province also stipulates that each county must hold two representative meetings of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs and revolutionary disabled soldiers every year. In terms of taking care of the lives of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, the substitute farming work in old revolutionary base areas has been improved, and the substitute farming system is being promoted in new areas. Various provinces generally have formulated substitute farming methods; cities have also paid attention to organizing the production of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs and introducing occupations. Various places have also issued a lot of preferential grain or relief grain. Some places have done a better job in the enrollment of children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, such as Jiangxi Province, which has established five children's schools with more than 1,900 students. Due to the improvement of preferential treatment work in various places, coupled with the active efforts of the families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs themselves, the political status and living standards of the families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs have been improved and improved, thereby inspiring the morale of the troops.

However, from the inspections in various places, it can also be seen that the following main problems still exist in the preferential treatment work:

    I. Leadership issues in preferential treatment work. Inspections in various places have found that the places where preferential treatment work is done well are primarily because the leading organs attach importance to this work. For example, the People's Government of Chahar Province issued instructions twice this spring on carrying out the movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs and doing a good job in preferential substitute farming work. In April, it organized a work team to inspect the preferential treatment work in Datong and Xuanhua counties, discovering and solving many problems. After the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea issued the three major appeals on June 1, Chairman Zhang Su of the province personally convened a preferential treatment symposium, which powerfully promoted the preferential treatment work in the province. The party organizations in some places frequently discuss preferential treatment work, and lower-level party committees report their work to higher-level party committees, stipulating that preferential treatment work must be included as part of the report content. Some places stipulate that cadres must understand the situation of preferential treatment work when going to the countryside and personally visit families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. However, in some places, due to the neglect of preferential treatment work by the leading organs, instead of the heads of departments taking action to promote the overall situation, they treat preferential treatment work as the work of individual departments, lacking regular supervision and inspection, thereby fostering various incorrect views of ordinary cadres and the masses on preferential treatment work, making preferential treatment work alternately hot and cold, and causing deviations.

    II. The issue of cadres and the masses' understanding of preferential treatment policies. In many places, preferential treatment work has been increasingly carried out and continuously improved due to the widespread publicity of policies. Cadres in Erdaogou Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, often explain the significance of preferential treatment work to the masses at night schools and various meetings and how to do a good job in preferential treatment work, and continuously conduct inspections. The masses have regarded preferential treatment work as a political task. The land cultivation time of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs in the village is earlier than that of the masses. With the help of the village government and the masses, the children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers have all been enrolled in schools or promoted to higher grades. At present, all patriotic pacts in the village have a clause on doing a good job in preferential treatment work. The masses often take the initiative to help families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs solve difficulties in life, such as fetching water and taking care of patients. The families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs are extremely satisfied. However, this inspection also found that some regions have produced deviations due to insufficient understanding of the specific content of preferential treatment policies by cadres and the masses. Especially in new areas, some cadres do not know how to carry out preferential treatment work, and they are unclear about many issues. For example, there is no standard for determining families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, which has caused dissatisfaction among families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs and the masses. In individual places, there have even been serious mistakes in considering dead enemy and puppet personnel and traitors as families of revolutionary martyrs. There are biases in the distribution of substitute farming and preferential materials, such as "human relations matter" and "preferring the near over the far." In the new urban area of ​​Lishan County, Hubei, it is believed that there are too many families of revolutionary martyrs in the old area to manage, so they are not given substitute farming. In some areas, when distributing subsidies, cadres only want to be simple and trouble-free and not offend anyone, so they adopt egalitarian methods. These biases not only waste manpower and resources but also fail to solve the actual problems of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs who are really in difficulty. In addition, the substitute farming work is still not done well in some places, and the phenomenon of random assignment of tasks is still common in new areas, and it has not been completely overcome in old areas. The fixed substitute farming system has not been fully implemented. Some places in new areas mistakenly believe that substitute farming work is a punishment for landlords and counter-revolutionaries under control, and only organize them to do substitute farming. These people certainly have the obligation to serve, but it is politically harmful and unreliable in terms of farming technology to have them do it completely without the participation of farmers. Some places in old areas have implemented a work point system, but they have relaxed organizational work, thinking that once the work points are issued, everything will be fine, resulting in families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs not being able to find anyone to exchange the work points, and substitute farmers not being able to exchange the work points for rice. Facts show that preferential treatment work cannot be completed properly without acting in accordance with policies. Therefore, not only should we publicize the significance of preferential treatment work, but we should also clearly explain the specific preferential treatment policies and methods to cadres and the masses, so that cadres and the masses not only know what should be done but also know how to do it.

    III. The issue of priority rights for families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. The priority rights and preferential treatment granted to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs stipulated in the preferential treatment regulations can only be guaranteed if they are implemented separately by banks, schools, health institutions, state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and other departments. The inspection found that although a small number of regions and units have implemented it, it is generally not done enough. For example, in some places, when issuing fertilizer or livestock loans, they do not notify some families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs because they are afraid that they will not be able to repay the loans. Some places think that since families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs have received preferential grain, they do not need to give them preferential treatment when issuing relief grain. Some state-owned enterprises do not give priority to employing families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs when recruiting employees, and they believe that "preferential treatment for families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs is the government's business." In the quota of public-funded students in schools, the proportion of children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers in some places is not the majority. For the above-mentioned problems, many places have proposed improvement methods during this inspection process. Many cities not only state-owned enterprises, schools, and health institutions have paid attention to giving priority rights to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, but also have influenced private enterprises, schools, and hospitals to give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs; individual departments in some provinces, such as the Chahar, Hebei, and North Anhui Cooperative General Association, have issued instructions stipulating preferential treatment methods for families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs and ordering lower-level units to implement them. The Chahar Branch of the People's Bank of China stipulates that preferential treatment work should be included in the monthly business report of its subordinates. It can be seen that in order to ensure the various priority rights of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, in addition to the civil affairs department taking the initiative to contact all parties, the relevant leading organs should formulate specific methods based on their own business scope and order lower-level organs to implement them in order to do a better job.

    IV. The issue of respecting the political status of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. The political status of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs has gradually improved with the improvement of the political awareness of the people across the country, and respecting families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs has become a social trend in some areas. Many families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs in various places have been elected as members of governments at all levels or people's representatives. In most areas, during festivals, the masses take the initiative to send gifts to express condolences to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. In Ruijin County, more than 1,400 households of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs have hung honorary plaques gifted by the county people's government on the doors of their houses. However, some cadres and the masses in various places still do not respect the political status of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs and revolutionary disabled soldiers enough. One of the main reasons is that they mistakenly believe that preferential treatment is limited to material and labor assistance, so they rarely care about families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs who can make a living independently (the proportion of these people is actually larger) on weekdays, making them unable to get spiritual comfort. For families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs who need material and labor assistance (the proportion of these people is actually smaller), they think, "We have already helped, what else do you want?" And they do not know that families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs pay great attention to their political status. Therefore, various places should continue to improve the political status of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs and revolutionary disabled soldiers in the future in order to create a social atmosphere of respecting families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs and revolutionary soldiers.

    V. Regarding the production and employment of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. Organizing families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs to produce and helping them establish their families is an effective way to solve the difficulties of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. In rural areas, two issues are particularly important in organizing families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs to produce. One is the fertilizer issue. The regulations on priority rights for families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs should be implemented in fertilizer loans, and they should be mobilized to accumulate fertilizer themselves and mobilize the masses to assist them seriously. In this inspection movement, Chahar Province set up public toilets to solve the fertilizer problem for families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs next year. This is one way. Another issue is to organize the masses and the labor force of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs to help each other, mobilize women from families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs to participate in production, especially sideline production. Some places have not yet paid attention to helping families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs to participate in production and establish their families, which is wrong. For example, Jin Mingfu's family of five in Yancheng County, Subei, has received relief eight times from the Spring Festival to now, totaling 310 kilograms of rice, but the cadres have not made long-term plans to help him formulate specific production plans, so his livelihood problems have not been resolved. In cities, especially in small and medium-sized cities, organizing the production of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs should be good at finding multiple and diverse ways. Zhangbei County, Chahar Province, has done a good job in this regard: introducing families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs to the livestock market as brokers, the liquor monopoly entrusts them to sell liquor, organizes them to raise chickens and pigs, and do other odd jobs, so that all families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs in the entire city pass have obtained occupations. However, the general small and medium-sized cities are doing a poor job in organizing families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs to participate in production. The reason is that the general cadres believe that organizing production must establish factories, and they are not good at finding production ways in many aspects. Therefore, all cities must adopt various methods to organize the production or employment of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs based on the specific situation of families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs and local conditions, and should not make unrealistic plans.

In short, this inspection of preferential treatment work has achieved great results, but all places must summarize the problems discovered so that preferential treatment work can be continuously improved, and regular inspections should be carried out in the future. Southern Jiangsu and Northern Jiangsu have decided to conduct another large-scale inspection in the autumn, which is very necessary in agricultural areas, and all places can follow suit.

　　优抚工作检查中发现的几个问题
       中央人民政府内务部优抚司
    在“八一”建军节前后开展的优抚工作检查运动，由于各地领导机关的重视和组织了各方面的力量进行检查，大部地区都做得比较普遍和深入，发动了群众，掀起了拥军优属的热潮。
    各地采用的检查方式，主要有下列四种。一种是召开会议，包括：各部门参加的优抚座谈会，各级民政干部参加的民政会议或优抚工作会议，全县扩大干部会，烈、军属代表或模范会议（有的拥军优属工作模范亦参加），烈、军属代表和民政干部或代耕户代表的联席会议等。这些会议都起了动员与教育群众的作用，也能反映一些情况，进行某种程度的优抚工作检查，但不易全面深入。另一种是由上级组织检查组，分赴各地进行重点检查，或就一个县逐区、逐村、逐户地进行全面检查。这种做法能引起地方上对优抚工作的重视，能帮助领导机关了解情况，发现问题；但必须发动群众的力量，形成运动，才能及时改进工作。第三种是就一县之内动员各方面的力量作全面的检查。如东北黑龙江省泰安县，组织了一千四百六十二人的检查组，包括区、村干部，烈军属和劳动模范等，到各村挨门挨户进行检查。这种作法很好，但如能有上级派出的检查组加以指导协助，收效将会更大。第四种做法是通知各村同时检查。但因各村工作基础不同，检查的深度也有所不同。有的作得很好，由代表和干部亲到田间察看烈军属的庄稼，并动员大家帮助解决烈军属的困难；有的作得较差，只由干部草率检查一下了事。为防止这种不平衡现象，有的地方曾事先集中村干部检查一、二村，取得经验，再各自回村检查。
    各地检查的结果，尚未全部总结，但仅就现有材料已可看出，我们的优抚工作，由于抗美援朝运动的开展，由于去年九月以后和今年春节各地两次比较普遍的检查，今年已获得很大成绩。一般地区对烈军属的政治地位已比较重视，注意吸收他们参加各种会议和工作。如湖南省长沙市有两名军属被选为省人民代表，四名被选为市人民代表，五百名参加了政府机关和公营企业的工作。黑龙江省泰安县的烈军属中有四百八十七名县、乡人民代表，二百五十九名县、乡政府委员。各地曾不断召开烈军属代表、烈军属模范代表会议或座谈会。浙江省并规定各县每年必须开两次烈军属和革命残废军人的代表会议。在照顾烈军属生活方面，老区农村的代耕工作已有改进，新区也正在推行代耕制度，各省一般都订有代耕办法；城市对组织烈军属生产和介绍职业亦已重视。各地并都发了不少的优待粮或救济粮。革命烈士和革命军人的子弟入学问题，有的地方做得较好，如江西省创办了五所子弟学校，学生达一千九百余人。由于各地改进了优抚工作，加以烈军属本身的积极努力，就使烈军属的政治地位和生活都有所提高与改善，从而鼓舞了部队的情绪。
    但从各地检查中，也可以看出优抚工作仍存在以下的主要问题：
    一、优抚工作的领导问题。各地在检查中发现：凡是优抚工作作得好的地方，首先是因为领导机关重视了这一工作。如察哈尔省人民政府，今春曾两次发出关于开展拥军优属运动与作好优军代耕工作的指示，四月间又组织工作组到大同、宣化两县检查优抚工作，发现并解决了不少问题。六月一日抗美援朝总会发出三大号召后，该省张苏主席亲自召开优抚座谈会，有力地推动了全省的优抚工作。有些地方党的组织经常讨论优抚工作，下级党委向上级党委报告工作，规定必须将优抚工作作为报告内容之一。有的地方规定干部下乡必须了解优抚工作情况，并亲自访问烈军属。但有些地方，由于领导机关忽视优抚工作，不是首长动手，推动全面，而是把优抚工作当作个别的部门工作，缺乏经常督促与检查，因而助长了一般干部和群众对优抚工作的各种不正确看法，使优抚工作忽冷忽热，发生偏差。
    二、干部和群众对优抚政策的认识问题。很多地方由于广泛进行了政策宣传，使优抚工作日益开展并不断改进。吉林省蛟河县二道河村干部，经常在夜校、各种会议上向群众讲解优抚工作的意义及如何才能做好优抚工作，并不断进行检查。群众已把优抚工作当作政治任务。该村烈军属的土地耕作时间均先于群众。革命烈士、军人的子弟，在村政府和群众帮助下，均已入学或升学。目前，全村所有的爱国公约中，均订有做好优抚工作一项。群众经常主动帮助烈军属解决生活中的困难，如挑水、照顾病人等。烈军属极为满意。但此次检查中，也发现有些地区由于干部和群众对优抚政策的具体内容认识不够，而产生了偏向。特别在新区，有些干部不知道如何进行优抚工作，他们弄不清的问题很多。如对于烈军属的确定漫无标准，以致引起烈军属和群众不满。在个别地方甚至发生把已死的敌伪人员和叛徒算为烈属的严重错误。对于代耕和优待物资的分配，存在着“人在人情在”、“优近不优远”的偏向。湖北礼山县新城区，竟认为老区烈属太多，管不了，而不给烈属代耕。有些地区发放补助物资，干部只图简单省事、不得罪人，而采用平均主义的办法。这些偏向不但浪费人力物力，且不能解决真正困难的烈军属的实际问题。此外，代耕工作仍有些地方做得不好，乱派差的现象在新区还很多，老区也未完全克服，固定代耕制度尚未全面推行。新区有的地方错误地认为代耕工作是对地主、被管制的反革命分子的一种惩罚，单是组织他们代耕。这些人当然有服役的义务，但完全由他们去做，没有农民参加，在政治上也是有害的，在耕作技术上都是极不可靠的。老区有些地方实行了工票制，但放松了组织工作，认为工票一发，万事大吉，致使烈军属拿了工票找不到人，代耕者拿了工票兑不到米。事实说明不按政策办事，便无法妥善地完成优抚工作的任务。因此，不仅要宣传优抚工作的意义，同时也应向干部和群众交待清楚具体的优抚政策和办法，使干部、群众不但知道应该做什么，并且知道怎样做。
    三、烈军属的优先权问题。优抚条例上规定给予烈军属的优先权和优待，只有由银行、学校、卫生机关、公营企业、合作社等部门分头执行，才能有保证。检查中发现虽然有少数地区与单位执行了，但一般是做得不够的。如有的地方在发放肥料或牲口贷款时，因为怕某些烈军属还不起，竟不通知他们。有的地方以为烈军属既然得了优待粮，在发放救济粮时，就不必给他们以优待了。有些公营企业在招收员工时，没有优先任用烈军属，他们认为“优属是政府的事”。学校公费生的名额中，有的地方的分配比例，革命烈士、革命军人的子弟并不占多数。对于上述问题，在这次检查过程中，有很多地方已提出改进办法，很多城市不但公营企业、学校、卫生机关已注意给烈军属以优先权，而且影响了私营企业、学校、医院，也给烈军属以优待；有些省的个别部门，如察哈尔、河北、皖北的合作总社，已发出指示，规定优待烈军属办法，通令下级执行。中国人民银行察哈尔分行，规定所属在每月的业务报告中，应有优抚工作一项。由此可见，要使烈军属的各种优先权有保证，除民政部门应主动与各方联系外，各有关领导机关应就自己的业务范围，规定具体办法，通令下级机关执行，才能做得更好。
    四、尊重烈军属的政治地位问题。烈军属的政治地位，已随着全国人民政治觉悟的提高而逐步提高，部分地区尊敬烈军属已成为社会风气。各地有很多烈军属当选了各级政府委员或人民代表。绝大部分地区，每逢年节，群众纷纷自动送礼品慰问烈军属。瑞金县有一千四百余户烈军属的住屋大门上都挂了由该县人民政府赠送的光荣匾。但各地仍有部分干部和群众对烈军属和革命残废军人的政治地位尊重不够。其主要原因之一，在于错误地认为优待只限于物质和劳力的帮助，因之对于可以独立谋生的烈军属（这些人的比例实际上较大），平日就很少过问，使他们得不到精神上的安慰。而对于需要物质与劳力帮助的烈军属（这些人的比例实际上较小），却又认为“我们已经帮助过了，还要怎么样呢？”而不知道烈军属是非常注意他们的政治地位的。因此，各地今后还应继续提高烈军属和革命残废军人的政治地位，以便造成尊重烈军属和革命军人的社会风气。
    五、关于烈军属的生产与就业问题。组织烈军属生产，帮助其建立家务，是解决烈军属困难的有效办法。在农村，组织烈军属生产有两个问题特别重要。一是肥料问题。这应该在肥料贷款中执行烈军属的优先权规定，并动员他们自己积肥，和发动群众认真加以协助。察哈尔省在此次检查运动中，设立公共厕所，以解决烈军属明年的肥料问题。这是一个办法。另一个问题是组织群众和烈军属劳力互助，发动烈军属妇女参加生产，特别是副业生产，有些地方，至今仍未注意帮助烈军属参加生产，建立家务，是不对的。如苏北盐城县金明辅一家五口，从春节到现在一共受到救济八次，计大米三百一十斤，但干部并未做长期打算，帮助他订出具体生产计划，致其生活问题仍未得到解决。在城市，特别在中小城市，组织烈军属生产应善于找出多式多样的门路。察哈尔省张北县在这方面做得很好：介绍烈军属到牲口市作经纪人，酒业专卖处委托他们卖酒，组织他们喂鸡，喂猪，以及做其他杂活，使全城关的烈军属都获得了职业。但目前一般中小城市对组织烈军属参加生产均做得较差，原因是一般干部认为组织生产就必须建立工厂，而不善于多方面寻找生产门路。因此，各城市必须依据烈军属的具体情况和当地条件，采用多种办法组织烈军属生产或就业，而不应作不切合实际的计划。
    总之，这次优抚工作的检查，已收到很大效果，但各地必须对所发现的问题加以总结，使优抚工作得以不断改进，今后并应作经常的检查。苏南、苏北已决定于秋后再进行一次大规模的检查，这在农业地区是非常必要的，各地均可仿行。
