Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 11th: This reporter has learned from the headquarters of the Korean People's Army front command that the twenty-first meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations began at 10:00 AM (Korean time) on August 11th and ended at 2:25 PM. The twenty-second meeting is scheduled for 10:00 AM on August 12th.

At the twenty-first meeting, no progress was made on the issue of determining the military demarcation line to establish a demilitarized zone. General Nam Il, chief representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation, pointed out that our side has never adopted a hasty attitude of refusing the other side's opinions without careful and calm study. However, the other side's statement yesterday that it "is no longer willing to discuss your proposal for the 38th parallel" is a crude and inappropriate expression of the other side's unwillingness to resolve the issue. General Nam Il accused the other side of deliberately confusing the military demarcation line, the southern edge of the demilitarized zone, and the current battle line, claiming that its plan is based on the "existing battle line" or "the general area of the existing battle line," while in fact it still insists on drawing the military demarcation line north of the 38th parallel, deep into our positions. General Nam Il questioned whether the other side deliberately obscures the absurdity and arrogance of its plan, confuses public opinion, and dares not make its plan as clear and understandable to the world as our side has done. General Nam Il reiterated that our plan to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line to establish a demilitarized zone has been unanimously understood by the people of the world since the beginning of the meeting, and is also recognized by the people of the world as a fair and reasonable plan. The United Nations Command delegation avoided making any response to General Nam Il's direct and forceful accusations and criticisms.

　　美方故意掩饰其荒谬方案
    南日将军予以严正指责
    朝鲜停战谈判会议关于军事分界线的讨论昨仍无任何进展
    【新华社平壤十一日电】本社记者自朝鲜前线总司令部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议第二十一次会议在八月十一日上午十时（朝鲜时间）开始，下午二时二十五分结束。第二十二次会议定于八月十二日上午十时举行。
    在第二十一次会议中，双方在确定军事分界线以建立非军事地区的问题上，仍未获得任何进展。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军指出：我方从未采取对于对方的意见不加仔细冷静的研究，而笼统地加以拒绝的粗率态度，而对方昨日“已经不愿再讨论你们的三八线的建议了”的声明，乃是对方不愿解决问题的粗率的不应有的表示。南日将军指责对方：故意将军事分界线，非军事地区的南缘，以及现在战线三者混为一谈，自称其方案是以“现有战线”或“现有战线的一般地区”作为基础，而事实上却依然坚持将军事分界划在三八线以北，深入我方阵地之内。南日将军质问对方是否故意掩饰其方案之荒谬狂妄，混淆对人民的视听，而不敢将其方案像我方一样清楚明白地公之于世。南日将军再度说明我方以三八线为军事分界线，从而建立非军事地区的方案，是自会议开始起全世界人民所一致了解的，也是全世界人民所公认为公平合理的方案。对于南日将军正面有力的指责和批评，联合国军代表团避免作任何答复。
