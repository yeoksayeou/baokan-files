Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: TASS, Pyongyang, August 8th: The Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" and other newspapers published a message from the Korean Central News Agency, exposing the aggressive plans of the US imperialists, which were once again revealed during the Kaesong negotiations.

The message stated: The Kaesong negotiations have been going on for a month, but none of the fundamental issues of the negotiations have been resolved. The reason for this situation is that the US side is unwilling to negotiate on the basis of equality and mutual understanding, and is trying every means to delay the negotiations, putting forward a number of demands that are completely devoid of sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue.

However, every rational person can understand that if both negotiating parties can act according to the principle of equality and are sincere in ending the bloodshed, they should first resolve various fundamental issues – concluding an armistice and ceasefire agreement, and withdrawing foreign troops from Korea. However, it can be seen from the progress of the negotiations that the United States has no sincerity in quickly resolving the issues on the agenda and taking the first step on the road to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Therefore, until now, none of the fundamental issues on the agenda have been resolved.

At the same time, the delegation of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who sincerely hope to resolve the Korean issue peacefully, proposed to first resolve the most important issues, such as establishing a military demarcation line on the 38th parallel, a ceasefire, the withdrawal of troops from both sides from the demarcation line, and establishing conditions to ensure the ceasefire.

On July 27, Joy, the chief representative of the US delegation, in the tone of an ultimatum, insisted that the military demarcation line should not be drawn on the 38th parallel, but should be drawn far north of the 38th parallel. Why does the United States insist on establishing a demarcation line on this line? Because this area not only contains rich and important minerals, but is also strategically advantageous for expanding the war. Under the guise of a defensive line, the US side is attempting to establish a strategic springboard to expand aggression into China and also launch an attack on the Soviet Union.

The message stated: The Korean people have always hoped for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Our delegation came to Kaesong with the sincerity of a ceasefire and the establishment of peace in Korea. We assume that the US delegation also needs a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, because the US government agreed to the suggestion of the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, regarding the first step in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and instructed Ridgway to begin negotiations on the issue of ceasefire and armistice.

However, the progress of the Kaesong negotiations, first of all the discussion process regarding the demarcation line and other demands from the US side, shows that the ruling groups in the United States only pay lip service to peace, but in action, they want to break the negotiations, continue the war, and expand aggression.

### 在停战谈判会议期间  美国再次露出扩大侵略马脚  朝鲜中央通讯社斥美方无谈判诚意

　　在停战谈判会议期间
    美国再次露出扩大侵略马脚
    朝鲜中央通讯社斥美方无谈判诚意
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社平壤八日讯：朝鲜《劳动新闻》及其他报纸发表朝鲜中央通讯社的消息，揭露开城谈判期间再次露出了马脚的美帝国主义的侵略计划。
    消息说：开城谈判已经一个月了，可是谈判的基本问题一个也没有解决。造成这种情况的原因是美方不愿在平等和互相谅解的基础上进行谈判，想尽办法拖延谈判，提出了若干完全不是诚意和平解决朝鲜问题的要求。
    然而，每一个有理性的人都能明白，假若谈判双方都能根据平等的原则，彼此都有终止流血的诚意，他们就应首先解决各种基本问题——订立停火与停战的协定，外国军队撤出朝鲜。然而从谈判的进程中可以看出，美国并无诚意迅速解决议程上的各项问题，在和平解决朝鲜问题的道路上走完第一步。因此，直到现在议程上的基本问题一个也没有解决。
    同时，诚意希望以和平方式解决朝鲜问题的朝鲜人民军最高司令部与中国人民志愿军的代表团，则提出首先解决最重要的问题，如在三八线上建立军事分界线，停火，双方自分界线上撤军，建立保证停战的条件。
    七月二十七日，美代表团首席代表乔埃以最后通牒的语气，主张军事分界线不应划在三八线上，而应划在三八线以北很远的地方。为什么美国要坚持在这条线上建立分界线呢？因为这个区域不仅蕴藏着丰富的重要矿产，而且在战略上说来对于扩大战争也是有利的。美方就是这样在防御线的掩饰下，企图建立一个战略跳板，把侵略扩大到中国去，也可对苏联发动进攻。
    消息说：朝鲜人民以前和现在都是希望和平解决朝鲜问题的。我方代表团带着停火和在朝鲜建立和平的诚意而到开城。我们假定，美方代表团也是需要和平解决朝鲜问题的，因为美国政府同意苏联驻联合国代表马立克关于和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步的建议，并训令李奇微就停火和停战问题开始谈判。
    但是，开城谈判的进程，首先是关于分界线和美方其他要求的讨论过程，表明了美国的统治集团只在口头上要和平，在行动上却想使谈判破裂，继续战争和扩大侵略。
