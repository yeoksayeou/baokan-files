Editor's Note: On July 15th, this newspaper published a report on the collapse of the Liangfengjiang Water Conservancy Project in Nanning, Guangxi Province. The following is a self-criticism from the main person in charge of the project.

Self-Criticism by Lin Shan, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government

The Liangfengjiang Water Conservancy Project in Nanning, Guangxi, was not carried out well, causing significant losses to the people's property and creating a negative impact among the masses. I am responsible for leading agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy work. I am a servant of the people, a Communist Party member. I request the Party and the government to punish me for this major dereliction of duty, and I offer the following self-criticism for public scrutiny.

	I. The Liangfengjiang Water Conservancy Project was not included in the original water conservancy plan last year. Later, due to bandit disturbances that affected the implementation of the original plan, we decided to divert the water conservancy funds from the original plan. To meet the demands of the masses, solve the unemployment problem of workers at that time, and expand the political influence of the People's Government, we prepared to build the Liangfengjiang Water Conservancy Project, and began surveying and designing it in July last year. Although we submitted written and oral requests to the Central-South Water Conservancy Department, we did not receive a clear reply. It was not until this spring, when the project was already more than half done, that the Central-South Water Conservancy Department retroactively approved it. This matter was not even discussed by the Provincial Finance and Economic Committee. This is an act of disorganization and indiscipline, and this was the error before the construction of this water conservancy project.

	II. After the project started, we did not go to the construction site to inspect it for more than half a year. We only learned some superficial information from reports at meetings and vaguely resolved some issues related to funding, laborers, materials, and cadre relations. Major issues such as design, construction, labor organization, and cadre ideology were not seriously studied and specifically resolved. Around the end of the year, some comrades mentioned that the Liangfengjiang project was not being done well and that leadership should be strengthened. At that time, I explained that there were not enough cadres and simply conveyed the opinions, vaguely proposing some remedial measures without making every possible effort to rectify the situation. This is a serious case of complacency and an irresponsible, sluggish work style.

	III. By May of this year, the mistakes had already been made. In order to convene a water conservancy conference to study typical cases, I went to the dam to inspect it. Although I also saw some serious mistakes during this inspection, it was still superficial and one-sided. For example, the experience of the bandit and criminal labor reform brigade was summarized only through inquiries and discussions with three or two cadres, without delving into the production brigades. Recently, Comrade Tao Zhu, Acting Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, inspected Liangfengjiang and not only thoroughly studied the entire water conservancy project, but also inspected the bedding, kitchens, and toilets of the production brigades, conducting inquiries and conversations, discovering and raising many problems. In comparison, I committed a serious error of being careless and bureaucratic.

Why did such serious mistakes occur? I often used the excuse that I was too busy, couldn't manage it, that there were not enough cadres, and that I lacked experience, but this is not the case. It is necessary to strictly point out that my leadership style is one of focusing on routine matters, without distinguishing between priorities, not being good at using cadres, not adopting leadership methods of focusing on in-depth inspections, and, more importantly, being politically insensitive and not being loyal enough to the Party and the people, thus causing this loss. I request the Party and the government to punish me, and I will follow the instructions to organize in-depth inspections and strengthen protection work. I sincerely accept the criticism given to me by the Party newspaper and am determined to correct my mistakes.

Self-Criticism by Hu Bin, Director of the Liangfengjiang Water Conservancy Project Office

The Liangfengjiang Water Conservancy Project is a water conservancy project directly managed by the Guangxi Provincial People's Government after liberation. The construction cost fifty billion yuan. This collapse of the project shows that the personnel responsible for our project are irresponsible to the people's cause. I should bear the main responsibility for this serious loss. I am the Director of the Liangfengjiang Water Conservancy Project Office and a Communist Party member. I sincerely and humbly accept the criticism of our office from the Party newspaper. I make the following self-criticism regarding this error:

	(1) The preparatory work was not done well. The Liangfengjiang Water Conservancy Project began surveying and designing in July 1950, and the channel selection was initially completed in September 1950. The earthwork and channel route were changed five or six times. This was because the different soil types were not studied, and the entire project lacked foresight. For example, the original plan for the stone work at the dam head was 6,200 cubic meters, but when the dam head was completed, more than 600 cubic meters were left over. These were all unnecessary losses. Tools were also often insufficient. We did not pay enough attention to this issue in our leadership thinking, always feeling that the less money spent, the better, which prevented the difficulties in the project from being resolved in a timely manner. For example, the wooden mallets used for compacting the soil were made in small quantities and were insufficient, so the laborers and the bandit and criminal labor reform team could not universally compact the soil. This is one of the reasons for the subsequent collapse of the channel. We had a purely task-oriented view, suffered from impatience, and did not conduct enough ideological education for the laborers. Construction began without mobilization or propaganda, which resulted in low morale and lax work. We did not conduct enough ideological education for the cadres, which prevented each engineering staff member and all personnel from developing a high sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for the people's cause, resulting in the idea that cadres should "sweep the snow from their own doors and not care about the frost on other people's roofs," and generating a purely technical viewpoint and a careless, perfunctory, and irresponsible attitude.

	(2) Bureaucratic leadership style. There was no unified work procedure or work plan. We grabbed at things randomly during work and did not conduct in-depth inspections. When problems occurred, we did not resolve them in a timely manner. I did not understand the technology myself, so when technical problems occurred, I pushed them onto the technical cadres and did not study them together. I was even afraid of saying something wrong and did not dare to lead boldly. At the same time, the democratic work style was poor. When problems were discovered in the project, relevant cadre meetings were not convened in a timely manner to study solutions; instead, one or two people were simply ordered to do things. Sometimes, the opinions raised by comrades were ignored, and it was believed that all issues should be decided by the leadership. For example, when it was discovered that there was too much earthwork opposite Sixia Village, no relevant cadre meeting was convened to study it; later, actual measurements by the masses revealed that the amount of earthwork could be reduced, saving a total of 2,000 cubic meters. For example, when weathered granite was discovered at Guibei, some comrades suggested moving the channel line outward, but this was not adopted or even paid attention to at the time, resulting in the collapse of the mountain soil. We treated comrades in this way, and we treated the masses in the same way. The masses in Pingxi Village discovered that the soil quality of the channel was not good and that there was water seepage, and requested the project office to find a solution. The project office emphasized that it was difficult to find a solution due to the shortage of supplies, and that the masses should find their own solutions. In addition, although the project office had stipulated various systems, they were not seriously implemented, which caused the cadres to become demoralized, fail to report on time, and fail to correct the shortcomings in the work in a timely manner.

	(3) Weak organizational concept and failure to ask for instructions and report. When making monthly work reports, we only reported on achievements and not on shortcomings and biases, making it impossible for the higher authorities to understand the project or estimate what problems might occur after the project was completed.

All of these serious mistakes are manifestations of irresponsibility to the people's cause. I accept the criticism from the Party newspaper and the higher authorities and am willing to accept the punishment I deserve from the Party and the government.

### 对于广西良凤江水利工程崩溃事件的检讨

　　对于广西良凤江水利工程崩溃事件的检讨
    编者按：七月十五日，本报发表了广西省南宁良凤江水利工程崩溃的报道。下面是该工程的主要负责人的检讨。
  广西省人民政府农林厅林山副厅长的检讨
    广西南宁良凤江水利工程没有搞好，使人民财产遭受重大损失，并在群众中造成不良影响。我负责领导农林水利工作，我是人民的勤务员，是共产党员，对此重大失职的错误，请求党与政府予以处分，并作下面检讨，公布出来请人民审查。
    一、去年原订的水利计划中并没有良凤江水利工程。后来因为土匪扰乱，影响了原计划的执行，我们便决定把原计划中的水利事业费移用。为应群众要求，解决当时工人失业与扩大人民政府的政治影响，就筹办良凤江水利工程，于去年七月间开始测量设计。虽然曾书面与口头请示中南水利部，但并没有得到明确批答。一直到今春工程已做了一大半，中南水利部才追认。这件事并且没有经过省财政经济委员会的研究。这是无组织、无纪律的行为，这是这个水利工程修建前的错误。
    二、开工以后，半年多我们没有到过工地察看，仅仅是在会议上报告中了解一些粗浅的情况，笼统地解决一些经费、民工、材料与干部关系问题。设计、施工、劳动组织与干部思想等重大问题，并没有认真研究具体解决。年底前后有些同志曾提过良凤江工程没有搞好，要加强领导。而当时我却以没有干部作解释，只是照样传达意见，泛泛地提出一些补救改进的办法，并没有尽可能地加以整顿，这是严重的麻痹思想和不负责任的疲塌作风。
    三、到了今年五月，错误已成，为了召开水利会议研究典型，我才到水坝去察看。这次察看虽也看到一些严重的错误，但还是肤浅片面。譬如总结匪犯劳动改造大队的经验，只是从三两个干部中询问与讨论，并没有深入到生产大队里去。最近中共广西省委代书记陶铸同志到良凤江视察，不但很周详地研究了整个水利工程，而且检查了生产大队的铺盖、厨房和厕所，进行询问谈话，发现并提出许多问题。对照起来，我是犯了严重的粗枝大叶、官僚主义的错误。
    为什么产生这样严重的错误呢？常常借口说工作太忙，顾不上，干部不够，没有经验，其实并不如此。必需严格地指出自己是事务主义的领导作风，不分轻重缓急，不善于使用干部，不采取重点深入检查的领导方法，更重要的是政治上麻木，对党对人民的忠诚不够，因此造成这个损失。我请求党与政府予以处分，并将遵照指示，组织深入检查加强防护工作。我诚恳接受党报给我的批评，决心改正错误。
  良凤江水利工程处胡彬主任的检讨
    良凤江水利工程是解放后广西省人民政府直接掌握的水利工程。兴建时用去工程费五十亿元。这次工程崩塌是表现我们工程负责人员对人民事业不负责任。造成这次严重损失，我应负主要责任。我是良凤江水利工程处主任，又是共产党员，我诚恳虚心地接受党报对我处的批评。对这次的错误我做如下的检讨：
    （一）没有将准备工作做好。良凤江水利工程是从一九五○年七月开始测量设计，渠道选择到一九五○年九月初步完成。土方工程、渠道路线共改变了五、六次。这是因为对不同的土质未加研究，对整个工程没有预见性所致。如坝首石方原计划六千二百方，结果坝首做完了还剩下六百多方，这都是不应有的损失。工具也时常不够用。在领导思想上很不注意这个问题，总觉得钱越用得少越好，使工程中的困难不能及时解决。又如填土硪工用的木槌做得少不够用，民工及匪犯劳动改造队无法普遍打硪工。这是后来渠道崩塌原因之一。我们有单纯任务观点，犯了急性病，对民工思想教育不够，没有经过动员、宣传就开工，以致民工情绪不高，工作松懈。对干部思想教育不够，不能使每个工程人员及全体人员发扬高度的对人民事业的责任感与积极性，造成干部“各扫自己门前雪，不管人家瓦上霜”的思想，产生了单纯的技术观点，和马虎草率不负责任的态度。
    （二）官僚主义的领导作风。没有统一的工作步骤与工作计划，在工作时乱抓，又不深入检查工作，发生问题时不及时解决。自己不懂技术，在技术上发生问题时就往技术干部身上推，不共同研究。甚至怕自己说得不对，而不敢大胆领导。同时民主作风差。在工程中发现问题，没有及时召集有关干部会议，研究解决，只是叫一两个人命令他们做。有时对同志们提出的意见采取不理的态度，认为一切问题由领导上决定就行了。如发现四厦村对面土方工程太多，也不召开有关干部共同研究；后来群众实际测量才发现可以减少土方数字，共节省二千土方。又如发现龟背风化石时，有些同志提出将渠线向外移的意见，当时不采纳也不注意，结果山土崩塌下来。对同志如此，对群众也如此。平西村群众发现渠道土质不好，有水渗出，请工程处设法解决。工程处强调处方困难不能解决，要群众自想办法。此外工程处虽曾规定有各种制度，但未认真执行，致使干部精神涣散，不按时汇报，工作中的缺点未能及时纠正。
    （三）组织观念不强，不请示报告。做工作月报时只报成绩不报缺点与偏向，使上级对该工程无法了解，无法估计工程完成后会发生那些问题。
    以上这些严重错误，都是对人民事业不负责的表现。我接受党报及上级对我的批评，并愿接受党与政府给我应得的处分。
