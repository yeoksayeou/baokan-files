　　“The serious problem is educating the peasants”
　　——A record of the cotton farmers of Shangquan Village selling cotton
　　Lei Si
　　"The serious problem is educating the peasants." This universally true saying has proven to be completely correct in all rural work, past and present.
　　Judging from this cotton purchasing and storage work, wherever the education of peasants was emphasized, the results were relatively significant. Not only was the task of purchasing and storing cotton completed, but the political consciousness of the peasants was greatly enhanced. Wherever ideological education was not emphasized, the results were mostly the opposite. Here, we will only compare the process of the cotton purchasing and storage work in Shangquan Village, Wu'an County, Hebei Province, from failure to success - the situation before and after the change in the working methods of the village's cotton purchasing and storage work team - to prove this point.
　　Shangquan Village is a well-known cotton-producing village in Wu'an County. Last year, under the call and support of the government, the villagers planted more than 7,200 mu of cotton, harvesting a total of more than 800,000 jin. After selling a large portion to cooperatives and using it to pay public grain, every household still had cotton in storage. The village's cotton purchasing and storage work team, in the initial period, did not understand the importance of educating the peasants, did not grasp this powerful weapon, and thought that no matter what, they just needed to get the cotton farmers to bring out the cotton. They did not analyze the ideological situation of the peasants after the land reform - due to the lack of political education, many peasants still did not understand the relationship between the country and the family, and one-sided capitalist ideas such as "getting rich" were growing - and did not actively solve this fundamental problem, but only adopted a negative approach of "treating the head when it hurts, and the foot when it hurts" to mobilize cotton farmers to sell and store cotton. The cotton farmers said: "Selling cotton is easy, bring good wheat, and we will sell if we have good wheat." (Of course, the importance of material supply cannot be denied.) So the work team immediately tried to transport more than 40,000 jin of good wheat. The cotton farmers complained that the price of cotton was low, so the work team raised the price (the method of raising prices is wrong and should not be followed in various places). The cotton farmers complained that the "grading" personnel were technically unskilled and afraid of suffering losses due to poor grading, so the work team transferred higher-level "grading" personnel. However, after meeting the needs of the cotton farmers for wheat and other materials, when continuing to mobilize the cotton farmers to sell cotton, the cotton farmers said: "There is no more cotton!" In fact, only half of the stored cotton was sold (more than 60,000 jin), and they wanted to wait for a higher price in the future for the other half.
　　Later, Shi Huixuan, Commissioner of Handan Prefecture, came to the village to inspect the cotton purchasing work. After discovering the above problems, he immediately reversed the work team's thinking and working methods, instructing the work team to not only meet the legitimate economic needs of the masses but also conduct patriotic education for the cotton farmers. At the same time, he also helped the work team hold a mass meeting. At this meeting, Commissioner Shi used simple language and vivid facts to explain the relationship between the country and the family, the relationship between workers and peasants, and the relationship between industry and agriculture to the peasants. Many elderly peasants, fearing that they could not hear clearly, moved forward to listen. After hearing each sentence, they nodded in agreement. As soon as he finished speaking, 162 people immediately volunteered to sell more than 11,000 jin of cotton on the spot. Commissioner Shi's approach and the patriotic enthusiasm of the peasants greatly inspired the work team, and they truly understood that conducting patriotic political education for the peasants was the key to the success or failure of the work. Therefore, according to Commissioner Shi's instructions, the work team, in collaboration with village-level cadres and activists, carried out mass patriotic education and a purchasing and storage campaign through cotton farmers' symposiums, mutual aid group meetings, and family meetings. At one symposium, cotton farmer Wu Laokao said: "The first time, I sold 570 jin of cotton and saved 290 jin, and I didn't want to sell it anymore. But after listening to Commissioner Shi's speech, I felt that I was letting down the country and the workers in the factory, and I felt uneasy. I sneaked a peek at the entrance of the cooperative and saw people constantly carrying cotton in, and my face felt a little hot. Everyone loves the country, can we lag behind?" He went home and sent all the remaining cotton to the cooperative without leaving any. At another symposium, everyone talked about how more than half of the 600 households in the village used electric lights, more than 1,000 people put on sneakers, more than 40,000 chi of foreign cloth were bought in the village in more than half a year, more than 100 new houses were built, and more than 30 livestock were added. Cotton farmer Wang Yuanmei said: "This is all thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao, a time that I couldn't even dream of in the past." When talking about why growing cotton can make you rich, Wang Jiuyuan said: "Isn't it because there are more factories and workers' production has increased? The more factories, the richer we become." When talking about the relationship between peasants and workers, Su Zhongzi said: "Coal, iron, pots, bowls, white sugar, alkali noodles, foreign cloth, sneakers, electric lights... which one is not made by workers for us? Those 'wearing straw hats' (farmers) cannot do without those 'wielding iron hammers' (workers) for a day." Hao Xianyuan said: "The two brothers cannot be separated, the workers are the elder brothers, we plant whatever they use. We use whatever, the workers make it for us." Most families in the village held family meetings to discuss patriotic cotton sales. At the family meeting, Liu Jingkui asked the women: "Do you want to wear printed cloth?" They said they wanted to wear it. Liu Jingkui said: "If you want to wear it, we have to sell the cotton to the country and send it to the factory to weave it into printed cloth for you." After the whole family agreed, he sold more than 1,000 jin of cotton to the country. After this series of patriotic and worker-peasant alliance ideological education, the cotton farmers in the village brought out all the remaining more than 60,000 jin of seed cotton and sold it to the country. The total number reached 130,000 jin.
　　This shows that the backward thinking of peasants is not unchangeable. As long as the relationship between the country and the family is clarified, they will protect their country and nation, and it is possible to turn our propaganda slogans into their actual actions. It is clear that after education, the peasants not only sold the cotton to the country, but also, in order to continuously supply the cotton mills with cotton in the future, the cotton farmers in the village more actively joined the struggle to eliminate aphids. Their cotton has been hoed four times, and they are hoeing it for the fifth time.
　　Of course, educating peasants is not something that can be completed in one or two times, but a long-term task. To have the peasants go with us all the way to socialist society requires continuous and arduous political education for the peasants.

### “严重的问题是教育农民”——记上泉村棉农售棉经过

　　“严重的问题是教育农民”
    ——记上泉村棉农售棉经过
     磊思
    “严重的问题是教育农民”，这一至理明言，在过去和现在农村的一切工作中，都证明是完全正确的。
    从这次购棉、储棉工作来说，什么地方重视了对农民的教育，什么地方的成绩就比较大。不只是完成了购、储棉任务，而且使农民的政治觉悟大大提高一步。凡不重视思想教育工作的地方，其结果多半相反。这里仅把河北省武安县上泉村的购棉储棉工作从失败到成功的过程——该村购、储棉工作组的工作方法转变前后的情形作一对照，就可以证明这一点。
    上泉村是武安县有名的产棉村庄。去年该村农民在政府的号召和扶植下，种了七千二百多亩棉花，共收棉八十多万斤。除过去卖给合作社及顶交公粮用去了一大部分而外，家家都还有存棉。该村的购储棉工作组，在开始一个时期，由于不懂得教育农民的重要，没有掌握这一有力武器，以为不管怎样，只要让棉农拿出棉花来就行。他们没有分析土地改革以后农民的思想情况——由于缺乏政治教育，许多农民还弄不清国与家的关系，片面的“发家致富”等资本主义思想正在生长——不去积极地解决这一根本问题，只采取了“头痛医头，脚痛医脚”的消极办法，动员棉农售、储棉花。棉农说：“卖棉花好说，你拿好麦子来，有了好麦子就卖。”（当然不能否认物资供应的重要）于是工作组马上设法运来好麦子四万多斤；棉农嫌棉花价格低，工作组就给提升价格（提价的办法是错误的，各地不应学习）；棉农嫌“分级”人员技术低，怕分不好吃亏，工作组就调来较高的“分级”人员。但在满足了棉农小麦等物资的需要以后，再继续动员棉农售棉时，棉农就说：“没有棉花了！”实际上存棉只卖了一半（六万多斤），还有一半他们要等以后卖大价钱。
    后来，邯郸专署专员石蕙轩到该村检查购棉工作，发现了上述问题，便立即扭转工作组的思想和工作方法，指示工作组：不仅要满足群众经济上的正当需要，而且要对棉农进行爱国主义教育。同时，他又帮助工作组召开了一个群众大会。在这个会议上，石专员用通俗的语言，活生生的事实，向农民讲解了国与家的关系、工人与农民和工业与农业的关系。很多年老农民怕听不清，挪动着往前凑。听得每句话后，都在点头称是。话刚讲完，就有一百六十二人当场自报卖棉一万一千多斤。石专员的这种作法和农民的爱国热情，给工作组以很大启示，确实了解了向农民进行爱国主义的政治教育，是工作成败的关键。于是工作组便根据石专员的指示，协同村级干部、积极分子，以棉农座谈会、互助组会及家庭会等方式，开展群众性的爱国主义教育和购、储棉运动。在一次座谈会上，棉农吴老考说：“头回，我卖了五百七十斤花，还存下二百九十斤，不愿再卖了。可是我听了石专员的讲话，觉得我对不起国家，对不起工厂的工人，心里老不自在。我到合作社门口偷看了一眼，见人家老往里背花，我的脸就有点发烧。谁也爱国，咱能落后吗？”他回到家去，把全部存棉一点也不剩地都送到合作社里去了。另一次座谈会上大家谈到，全村六百多户，一半人家使上手电灯，一千多人穿上了球鞋，半年多全村买进四万多尺洋布，盖了百来间新房，添了三十多头牲口。棉农王元梅说：“这都是毛主席领导的好，是过去作梦也梦不到的时光。”谈到种棉花为什么能发家时，王九元说：“还不是因为工厂多了，工人生产大了。工厂越多，咱们就越富。”谈到农民和工人的关系，苏中子说：“煤、铁、锅、碗、白糖、碱面、洋布、球鞋、手电灯……那个不是工人给咱造的。‘戴草帽’的（农人），一天也离不开‘抡铁锤’的（工人）。”郝先元说：“兄弟俩谁也离不开谁，工人是老大哥，他们用什么，咱们就种什么。咱们用什么，工人就给造什么。”该村多数家庭都开了家庭会，商量爱国售棉的事。刘景奎在家庭会上问妇女们：“你们想穿花布不？”她们说想穿。刘景奎说：“想穿，咱们就得把棉花卖给国家，送到工厂里替你们织成花布。”他在全家同意以后，把一千多斤棉花卖给了国家。经过这一系列的爱国主义及工农联盟思想的教育，全村棉农把剩下的六万多斤籽棉都拿了出来，卖给国家。总数达到十三万斤。
    从这里说明，农民的落后思想，不是不可以改变的。只要把国与家的关系弄通，他们是爱护自己的国家、民族的，是可以把我们的宣传口号，变成他们的实际行动的。很明显，经过教育后，农民不只是把棉花卖给了国家，而且为了今后源源供给纱厂用棉，该村棉农更加积极地投入了除治蚜虫的斗争。他们的棉花已锄了四遍，又在锄第五遍。
    当然，对农民进行教育不是一次两次就可以算完的，而是一个长时期的任务。要农民和我们一道一直走到社会主义社会，需要不断地艰苦地对农民进行政治教育。
