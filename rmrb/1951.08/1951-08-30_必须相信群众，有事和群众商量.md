　　We Must Trust the Masses, Discuss Matters with the Masses
        Zhang Ying
    Chairman Mao said in "Get Organized!" "What is the real bastion of iron? It is the masses, the millions upon millions of people who sincerely and wholeheartedly support the revolution."

    Chairman Mao also said in "Preface 2 to <Rural Survey>": "It must be understood that the masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous. Without this understanding, it is impossible to acquire even the most rudimentary knowledge. ... Together with all comrades in the Party, learn from the masses and continue to be a student; this is my wish."

    This is Chairman Mao's main method of thinking. Chairman Mao used this kind of thinking to educate the whole Party, and used this kind of thinking to guide work. Chairman Mao is the most outstanding representative who is best at concentrating the opinions of the masses and turning them into guiding wisdom.

    It was six years after I started working that I began to have a relatively deep understanding of these teachings in my mind.

    In 1943, I worked in Zanhuang County, Taihang District. At that time, the Japanese invaders occupied about half of the county, and the struggle between the enemy and us was extremely complex and acute. This area had undergone rent and interest reduction in 1942, but the harvest was not good this year. After the rent and interest reduction, the main task was to organize production and further mobilize the masses to support the struggle against the enemy. In the spring of 1943, the wheat harvest was very poor, and the drought was severe. In early July, the autumn crops were all dried up, and late planting was impossible. In some areas, even the tree leaves were withered. When I came to this area, many farmers and cadres were in extreme pessimism and despair. Some cadres said: "There is no problem in the struggle against the national enemy and class enemy, but what can we do if it doesn't rain!" The masses demanded to fight drought, produce and survive the famine, and solve urgent livelihood problems. The higher-level Party committee also issued a decision to fight drought, produce and survive the famine. However, where did the solution come from? At that time, I wanted to ask the higher authorities or the comrades who worked with me for solutions, but the higher authorities could not make it rain, and I could not think of any solutions either. I also felt that we had no solutions, and of course the masses had no solutions, so I was at a loss and felt pessimistic and distressed.

    However, the problem must be solved. Pessimism and distress would not work. A solution must be found, because if the urgent livelihood problems of the masses could not be solved, the struggle against the enemy could not be supported. So, I thought of the extreme difficulties that the Soviet areas and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region had experienced in the past due to war and natural conditions, which were all overcome under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Thinking of the past and thinking of Chairman Mao, my confidence was strengthened. We began to study Chairman Mao's report on economic and financial issues at the meeting of high-ranking cadres in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and study the Central Committee's decision on leadership methods, with the hope of finding some solutions from past experience.

    In his report "Economic Problems and Financial Problems", Chairman Mao vividly and specifically introduced the endless experiences and methods created by the masses in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in developing the economy and smashing the Kuomintang's blockade. What impressed me the most was that Chairman Mao, based on the experience of the Nanqu Cooperative, proposed the policy of overcoming "paternalism" and "implementing people-run and government-assisted", which finally reversed the bad situation that "the cooperative's business is not oriented towards the masses, but mainly towards the government..." and "...is regarded by the masses as a burden imposed on them, not as their own." Chairman Mao also introduced Lu Zhongcai's experience of transporting salt during the Long March to solve the masses' concerns, proving that carrying salt was not a terrifying thing (not about people and animals dying and never returning), but a profitable business, thus greatly developing the salt carrying business and opening up an important source of finance for the Border Region. These moving examples gave me an insight: the masses have solutions, and as long as we discuss with the masses, we can solve any difficulty.

    With this insight, I began to realize that the farmers were by no means lying down. They were stubbornly fighting against natural disasters.

    An old farmer in Shangmayu Village preserved more than one mu of cornfield in the ditch south of the village. He tried his best to deepen the water pit time and time again, watering it with a scoop. This more than one mu of corn did not die from drought. He advocated: "Save as much as you can." One day at noon, an old farmer in Ximayu Village was carrying a manure basket to collect manure. He scolded his son: "It's no use just lying down! It will rain sooner or later, and collecting some manure will be useful in the future."

    Many things tell us that believing in the masses means seeing the wisdom and creativity of the masses, thus further increasing our confidence.

    We also found six or seven old farmers and discussed with them: Which local water sources can be used? How did you survive the famine years in the past? Which methods can work? They described various ways to survive the famine in the past, how they survived in a very dry year, and how they survived in a very wet year. They said: "For millet, if it is planted when it is about half a cun tall at the beginning of autumn, it can still yield 30 to 40 percent. It is about to be the beginning of autumn now, and millet cannot be planted." And they suggested: "Radishes in early fu [a period in the lunar calendar], vegetables in mid-fu, and late buckwheat can be planted in late fu. If it rains in early August, vegetables can still be planted. We should prepare vegetable and buckwheat seeds. If the preparation is sufficient and can be widely planted, the vegetables will ripen and can be equivalent to several years of harvest. 'Bran and vegetables for half a year's food', our people here can endure hardship."

    Through investigation meetings and individual conversations, we came up with some solutions: repairing canals, cooperatives setting up buckwheat seeds and vegetable seeds, mobilizing the masses to collect tree leaves and thistle vegetables, and planning to develop sideline production such as spinning, oil pressing, and transportation in winter. Therefore, the county party committee made a decision to mobilize the masses with all their strength.

    "The people can teach us many, many things." (Chairman Mao: "Conversation with Stein") These methods were taught to us by the masses, and we concentrated them and mobilized the masses to do them.

    It rained heavily on August 3rd. I remember this day very well.

    Taking advantage of the rain, we focused on Ximayu Village, convened an investigation meeting, and discussed with the farmers what could be planted and what could not be planted, which land needed to be replanted, and which land needed to be destroyed and replanted. We also discussed what the farmers lacked. Everyone discussed and exchanged opinions: land with 30 to 40 percent of crops should be replanted, and land with only 10 to 20 percent should simply be destroyed and replanted. Because it was necessary to rush to plant quickly, the biggest difficulty for some farmers was the lack of labor and livestock. So we studied the solutions. Everyone reviewed that although mutual aid teams had been organized in the past, they were formalistic, the organization was huge, and it was not a voluntary combination, so the masses thought it was "for the higher authorities." After review and research, it was proposed to organize small-scale temporary mutual aid and exchange labor this time, adopting the method of exchanging labor with like-minded people, exchanging people and animals, and equivalent exchange. Everyone also mentioned that a few farmers were now short of food, and some were short of vegetable seeds and buckwheat seeds. So everyone discussed and adjusted seeds with each other, helped each other with food, the village cooperative held a seed loan, the government issued small loans, and allocated some sesame cakes to help the poorest farmers. After discussing and studying with the masses, the problems were found and the solutions were thought out. The experience of this village was widely introduced to other villages. In three or four days, the whole county carried out a blitz, all the land was planted, and some villages also reclaimed some wasteland, and turnips were sown in the wasteland.

    More than ten days later, the vegetable seedlings were growing vigorously. Suddenly, more than a dozen villages experienced serious shell insects, which spread quickly. If they were not controlled, there would be no hope for vegetables, so we had to ask the masses for advice again. They gave many methods for controlling insects, and the most effective was to organize the masses to catch them. Therefore, the county party committee issued a call to mobilize and organize children and women to go to the fields to catch them, and they were quickly caught. In winter, according to the specific conditions of each district and village, each family made a famine survival plan and vigorously developed sideline production. This year, the public grain task was completed as scheduled, which played a great role in supporting the struggle against the enemy in the marginal areas. The urgent livelihood problems of the masses and the tasks of the revolutionary war were both solved well.

    This matter is hard to forget in my memory. It is not only because this was the biggest problem I encountered for the first time after I started working, but also because I made great progress in this work. My progress lies in no longer thinking that I am the smartest, no longer thinking that the masses are "backward and ignorant" and "do whatever they are told"; on the contrary, I began to feel that the masses are the most intelligent. I no longer just ask the higher authorities for solutions. Now I began to understand that discussing with the masses will lead to many practical, reliable and feasible solutions. Why do the masses have so many solutions? I considered this question. The masses are the driving force of history, the creators of social wealth, the most experienced in the struggle for production, and they are most familiar with the specific situation, so the solutions are the most practical. As long as we discuss with them well, there will be many solutions. The truth is very clear, but in the past, because I regarded myself as Zhuge Liang and the masses as A Dou, I could not discover this source of great wisdom.

    Chairman Mao said: "...As long as we rely on the people and firmly believe that the creativity of the people is endless, and therefore trust the people and become one with the people, then any difficulty can be overcome, and any enemy cannot overwhelm us, but will be overwhelmed by us." ("On the Coalition Government") After carefully chewing on these teachings, I deeply felt that our strength is the greatest, because we serve the masses, and the masses support us. I also deeply felt that there will be solutions to everything, because the masses are the source of wisdom. As long as we are good at discussing with the masses, trusting the masses, and relying on the masses, any enemy can be defeated, not only can we defeat all class enemies, but also "man will conquer nature."

    Concentrating the wisdom of the masses is the greatest wisdom, but it does not mean that every mass will propose a set of plans and solutions. They will tell us some of their personal experiences and struggle experiences, and they will put forward some opinions on the current policies, but they are often fragmented, or even one-sided, so the role of leadership is not only to concentrate the scattered and unsystematic opinions of the masses, carefully analyze and study them, and transform them into concentrated and systematic opinions to be implemented, but also to be good at extracting solutions and collecting experience from the actions of the masses.

    In this production and famine relief, many villages did a better job because they led in this way. For example:

    Zanhuang County's Second District produces persimmons, but they could not be exported at that time, so they were very cheap. Some people in Ximayu Village, Third District, went to buy persimmons, then went to Shanxi to buy some bran, simmered the persimmons until they were soft, dried them, mixed them with bran and crushed them to make "sweet bran", which could be eaten. They calculated that it was very cheap. At first, only a few families did this. The leadership discovered it, discussed it with the masses, and thought the method was very good. So they publicized and promoted it, so that more masses acted. In this way, the problem of selling persimmons in the Second District was solved, and the problem of famine relief was also partially solved.

    Some villages did not do a good job, and the interests of the masses were damaged. Liujiagou in the Third District is an example. What is the reason?

    When the county party committee's decision on production and famine relief reached Liujiagou, the district cadres here did not discuss the famine relief methods with the masses, but simply completed the task for the higher authorities. And they did not carefully understand the spirit of the decision, but one-sidedly accepted the two tasks of seed preparation and organizing the masses to collect thistle vegetables. The district cadres forced the masses to collect thistle vegetables, and when they reported to the county, they said: "The village cadres there do not lead the masses to collect wild vegetables, but organize the masses to go to Shanxi to do business and make a fortune." The village cadres and the masses were very dissatisfied with this statement. What was the actual situation? Liujiagou and Pindin in Shanxi have historically had frequent trade exchanges, transporting earth cloth to Pindin and exchanging grain to transport back. The village cadres organized the masses to use this method to survive the famine, which was their creation and their merit, but some district cadres criticized them instead. This attitude of lacking mass viewpoint, mechanically implementing instructions, and simply completing tasks, and the commandist style, is inseparable from the county party committee's past ideological style of lacking mass viewpoint.

    These facts all show that: if you do not care about the lives of the masses, do not proceed from reality, do not believe in the masses, do not discuss with the masses how to survive the famine, but simply complete the task, the work becomes coercion and command, is divorced from the masses, the masses are dissatisfied, and the task will not be completed.

    Chairman Mao once earnestly warned us: "Without investigating the actual conditions, without looking at the whole picture (and not merely at a fragment), without touching upon the essence (and not merely on the phenomena) of a thing, dogmatically to pronounce judgment on it—such is the method of work we most emphatically oppose." ("On Practice")

    With a task, there must be a work method to complete the task.

    In his article "Get Organized!", Chairman Mao compared completing the task to crossing a river, and compared the work method to the bridge or boat for crossing the river. A work method that does not follow the mass line is like having no bridge or boat to cross the river. Without a bridge or boat, there is only sighing from across the bank.

    Looking back at my own past work, I have also encountered many setbacks. Why did I encounter setbacks? The main reason is that I simply proceeded from the task, did not believe in the wisdom and creativity of the masses, did not discuss matters with the masses, or was not good at discussing with the masses, and adopted the work method of paternalism, substitution, coercion and command. Facts have proved that Chairman Mao's teachings must never be forgotten: "Learn from the masses and continue to be a student." ("Preface 2 to <Rural Survey>")

### 必须相信群众，有事和群众商量

　　必须相信群众，有事和群众商量
        张颖
    毛主席在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》中说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”
    毛主席在《〈农村调查〉序言二》中又说：“必须明白：群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己是往往幼稚可笑的。不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。……和全党同志们共同一起向群众学习，继续当一个小学生，这就是我的志愿。”
    这就是毛主席的主要思想方法。毛主席就是以这种思想教育全党，以这种思想指导工作。毛主席是最善于集中群众意见变成指导智慧的最杰出的代表者。
    在思想上开始比较深刻体会这些教言，是在我参加工作六年后的事。
    一九四三年，我在太行区赞皇县工作。当时，日寇占领着全县约二分之一的地区，敌我斗争异常复杂尖锐。这个地区已在一九四二年经过减租减息，但这一年年成不好。减租减息后，工作主要是组织生产，进一步发动群众支持对敌斗争。一九四三年春，麦收很差，旱灾严重，七月初，秋庄稼都旱死了，晚地无法种，有的地区树叶子都旱枯了。当我来到这地区的时候，许多农民和干部正陷于极度悲观失望，有的干部说：“对民族敌人阶级敌人的斗争毫无问题，但天不下雨有什么办法呢！”群众要求抗旱生产度荒，解决迫切的生活问题。上级党委也发下了抗旱生产度荒的决定。但是，办法从那里来呢？当时就想向上级或向自己一块工作的同志们要办法，但是上级不能下雨，自己也想不出办法，又觉得我们没有办法，群众当然更没有办法，于是束手无策，悲观苦闷。
    可是，问题必须解决，悲观苦闷不行，办法必须想出来，因为如果群众迫切的生活问题解决不了，对敌斗争就无法支持。于是，想到过去苏区、陕甘宁边区经历过战争和自然条件的极度困难，在毛主席领导下都一一克服了。想到过去，想到毛主席，信心加强了。我们就开始钻研毛主席在陕甘宁边区高干会上关于经济问题和财政问题的报告，钻研中央关于领导方法的决定，抱着一个希望：从过去的经验里能够找到一些办法。
    毛主席在《经济问题与财政问题》的报告中，生动而且具体的介绍了陕甘宁边区群众在发展经济粉碎国民党封锁的斗争中所创造的无穷无尽的经验和方法。给我印象最深的是：毛主席根据南区合作社的经验，提出克服“包办代替”“实行民办官助”的方针，终于扭转了“合作社的事业不是面向群众，而主要地是面向政府……”和“……被群众认为是摊派负担，而不被认为是群众自己的”恶劣状况。毛主席又介绍了鲁忠才长征运盐的经验，来解决群众的顾虑，证明驮盐不但不是恐怖的事（并不是死人死牲口，一去不得回来），而且是赚钱的事，从而大大发展了驮盐事业，开辟了边区一个重要的财政来源。这些动人的事例，使我得到了一个启示：群众是有办法的，只要和群众商量，就可以解决任何困难。
    有了这一启示，就开始发觉农民绝没有躺倒。他们对自然的灾害顽强的在斗争着。
    上马峪村一个老农在村南沟里保全了一亩多玉茭地，一次又一次尽力把水坑挖深，一瓢一瓢的浇，这一亩多玉茭没有旱死。他主张：“能保住一分就保住一分”。又一天晌午，西马峪村一个老农提着粪筐要去拾粪，他骂他的儿子：“光躺倒还行！迟早总得下雨，拾点粪将来就有用。”
    许多事情都告诉我们：相信群众，就看到群众的智慧和创造，因而更增强了自己的信心。
    我们又找到六、七个老农民，和他们商量：当地那些水源可以利用？过去闹荒年是怎么度过的？有那些办法可以行通？他们叙述过去度荒的各种办法，那一年是大旱年，是怎样度过的，那一年是大涝年，是怎样度过的。他们说：“谷子这庄稼，立秋扎手心（苗长寸半高的时候），还可收成三四分。现在就要立秋，谷子不能种了。”并且提出：“头伏的萝卜，二伏的菜，三伏能种晚荞麦。八月初见雨，也还能种菜蔬。应该准备菜子荞麦种。若是准备充足，能普遍种上，菜蔬熟了，也可顶几成年景。‘糠菜半年粮’，我们这里老百姓是能吃苦的。”
    通过调查会，个别谈话，就有了些办法：修渠，由合作社筹办荞麦种和菜子，发动群众打树叶采刺儿菜，并计划冬季开展纺织、打油、运输等副业生产。于是县委作了决定号召动员群众全力进行。
    “人民能教给我们许许多多事情。”（毛主席：《与斯坦因的谈话》）这些办法，就是群众教给我们，我们集中起来又动员群众来做。
    八月三日下了透雨，这个日子在我脑子里记得真牢。
    趁着雨，我们就以西马峪村作重点，召集调查会，和农民商量能种什么，不能种什么，那些地需要补种，那些地需要毁了重种，农民缺少什么。大家商量，交换意见：有三四成庄稼的地就补种，只一二成的干脆毁了另种。因为需要突击赶快种，有些农户的最大困难就是劳力畜力缺乏。于是研究办法。大家检讨过去互助组虽有组织，但流于形式，组织庞大，又非自愿结合，群众认为是“给上级搞的”。经过检讨和研究，提出这次组织小型临时互助变工，按心意相投和采取顶工换工，人畜互换，等价交换的办法。大家又提到有少数农民现在缺粮，也有的缺菜种荞麦种，于是大家商量，互相调剂种子，互济粮食，村合作社举办贷种，政府发放少额贷款，并拨出一部分麻饼救济最贫的农民。经过和群众商量研究，问题找出了，办法想出了。把这个村子的经验广泛介绍给别的村，三四天里，全县突击，所有的地都种上了，有的村子还开了些荒地，荒地里撒上了蔓菁。
    十数天后菜苗正长得茁壮，突然有十几个村子，又发生了严重的壳壳虫，蔓延很快，如打不下去，菜蔬就没有希望了，只好又请教群众。他们又给了许多治虫的办法，最有效的是组织群众捕捉。于是县委提出号召，发动组织儿童妇女下地捕捉，很快就捕光。冬天根据各区各村具体情况，每家订度荒计划，大量开展副业。这一年公粮任务如期完成，对边缘地区支持对敌斗争起了很大作用。群众迫切的生活问题和革命战争的任务都解决得较好。
    这一件事在我的记忆里很难遗忘。不只是因为这是我参加工作后第一次碰到的最大难题，而且是因为在这一次工作里使我得到了很大的进步。我的进步就在于不再认为自己最聪明，不再认为群众是“落后无知”“叫干啥就干啥”；相反的，我开始感到群众是最有智慧。我也不再是只向上级要办法了。现在开始懂得，和群众商量就会有许许多多切实可靠行得通的好办法。为什么群众会有这样多的办法呢？我考虑这个问题。群众是历史的推动者，是社会财富的创造者，在生产斗争中经验最丰富，而且他们最熟悉具体情况，所以办法最实际，只要和他们好好商量，办法就很多。道理很明白，但是过去由于把自己当做诸葛亮，把群众当做阿斗，就发现不了这伟大智慧的源泉。
    毛主席说过：“……只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”（《论联合政府》）仔细咀嚼这些教言，深深地感到我们的力量是最巨大的，因为我们为群众服务，群众拥护我们，也深深地感到什么事情都会有办法，因为群众就是智慧的源泉。只要善于和群众商量，相信群众，依靠群众，什么敌人也打得倒，不仅能打得倒一切阶级的敌人，并且“人定胜天”。
    集中群众的智慧就是最大的智慧，但不是说每一个群众都会提出一套一套的方案和办法。他们会告诉我们一些他们亲身经历的事情和斗争的经验，他们会对当前的政策提出一些意见，但往往是零碎的，甚或是片面的，所以领导的作用，不仅要把群众分散无系统的意见集中起来，仔细分析研究，化为集中的系统的意见贯彻下去，并且要善于从群众的行动中再去提取办法，收集经验。
    在这次生产度荒中，许多村工作做的比较好，他们就是这样领导的。如像：
    赞皇县二区出柿子，但当时不能出口，所以很便宜。三区西马峪村有的群众就去买柿子，再到山西买些糠，把柿子焖软晒干，掺糠碾碎作成“甜面糠”，可以吃。他们盘算起来，很便宜，最初只几家这样作，领导上发现了，和群众一商量，办法很好，于是宣传推广，使更多的群众行动起来，这样二区柿子销售问题解决了，救荒问题也解决了一部分。
    也有的村工作做的不好，群众的利益受到了损失。三区刘家沟就是一个例子。什么原因呢？
    当县委生产度荒的决定到了刘家沟，这里的区干部不和群众商量度荒的办法，而是单纯地给上级完成任务。并且对决定的精神不是用心领会，而是片面地接受了备种和组织群众打刺儿菜两项工作。区干部强迫群众打刺儿菜，他们向县里汇报时反说：“那里的村干部不去领导群众去打野菜，却组织群众去山西做买卖发洋财”。村干部和群众对这种说法很不满。实际的情况是怎样呢？刘家沟和山西平定从历史上就经常有买卖往来，运土布到平定，换粮食运回来，村里干部这样组织群众用这办法度荒，正是他们的创造，正是他们的功劳，而一些区干部反批评了他们。这种缺乏群众观点机械执行指示，单纯完成任务的态度和命令主义的作风，是和过去县委缺乏群众观点的思想作风分不开的。
    这些事实都说明了：不关心群众生活，不从实际出发，不相信群众，不和群众好好商量如何度荒，而是单纯完成任务，工作成了强迫命令，脱离群众，群众不满，任务就完不成。
    毛主席曾经谆谆的告诫我们：“不问环境的情况，不看事情的全体，也不触到事情的本质，就自以为是地发号施令起来，这样的人是没有不跌交子的。”（《实践论》）
    有了任务，就要有完成任务的工作方法。
    毛主席在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》一文中，把完成任务比作过河，把工作方法比作过河的桥或船。不走群众路线的工作方法，就像没有过河的桥或船，没有桥或船，那只有隔岸兴叹了。
    回想我自己过去在工作中，也曾碰过很多钉子，为什么会碰钉子呢？主要就是因为单纯从任务出发，不相信群众的智慧和创造，有事不和群众商量，或不善于和群众商量，采取了包办代替强迫命令的工作方法。事实证明了毛主席的教言是绝不能忘记的：“向群众学习，继续当一个小学生。”（《农村调查》序言二）
