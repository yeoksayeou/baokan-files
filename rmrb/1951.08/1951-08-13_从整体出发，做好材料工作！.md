　　Proceed from the Overall Situation and Do a Good Job in Materials Work!
    Doing a good job in materials work is one of the important links in implementing the economic accounting system. It is incorrect for some cadres to underestimate the importance of materials work.
    Why is there such a serious waste of materials in the national railway system? This is because some cadres lack an overall perspective and have not yet realized that whether materials are saved or not is an important indicator of whether the production task is completed.
    It is, of course, right for some comrades to actively complete production tasks; but in the process of completing production tasks, it is obviously wrong to not pay attention to saving materials, or even to pursue the completion of tasks without regard to whether materials are wasted. Some comrades think that "materials work is work that serves people" and is insignificant. Therefore, they favor production work and completely ignore materials work. This is a purely task-oriented and localized view that only cares about "completing production tasks." Comrades with this view do not understand that if materials work is not done well, production work will inevitably not be done well either. With this view, the phenomenon of serious waste of materials is bound to occur.
    In fact, all departments of the people's enterprises must be an integrated whole that cooperate with each other and supervise each other. Therefore, while comrades in the production department are asking the materials department for materials, they should consider whether the materials they want meet the actual needs, and they should work with the comrades in the materials department to find ways to solve the difficulties in materials supply. While supplying materials, comrades in the materials department must review and supervise the use of materials by the production department. Any idea that ignores the integrity of the various departments of the people's enterprise, only cares about one's own unit without helping other units, is harmful to the development of the people's enterprise.
    At present, the national railway is carrying out the work of clearing up assets and verifying funds. The exposure of the waste of materials in the national railway system by the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, published in this newspaper today, should attract the attention of all regions. All railway administrations across the country must, through this asset clearing and fund verification work, seriously clear up inventory materials, clarify useless or temporarily unused materials, and determine working capital based on facts, so as to lay a good foundation for the implementation of the economic accounting system. To do this work well, we must first strengthen the overall concept. Therefore, resolutely opposing localized viewpoints has become an important task for railway employees across the country.

### 从整体出发，做好材料工作！

　　从整体出发，做好材料工作！
    做好材料工作是实行经济核算制的重要环节之一。某些干部轻视材料工作的思想，是不正确的。
    为什么全国铁路材料会有严重的浪费现象呢？这是因为有些干部缺乏整体观念，还没有认识到材料节省与否是完成生产任务与否的一个重要标志。
    有些同志积极地完成生产任务，这自然是对的；但在完成生产任务的过程中，不注意节省材料，甚至为了追求任务的完成，而不问材料是否浪费，这就显然不对了。有些同志认为“材料工作是侍候人的工作”，是无足轻重的。因而他们偏爱生产工作，而根本忽视了材料工作。这是只顾自己“完成生产任务”的单纯任务观点和局部观点。有着这种观点的同志不了解：材料工作做不好，生产工作也必然做不好。有了这种观点，就势必产生严重地浪费材料的现象。
    事实上，人民企业的各个部门必须是互相配合和彼此监督的整体。因此，生产部门的同志在向材料部门要材料的同时，就应该考虑自己所要的材料是否符合于实际的需要，就应该和材料部门的同志共同设法解决材料供应方面的困难。材料部门的同志在供应材料的同时，就必须对于生产部门运用材料的情况加以审查和监督。任何忽视人民企业各部门的整体性，只顾自己单位而不帮助别的单位的思想，都是有害于人民企业的发展的。
    现在，全国铁路正在开展清理资材、核定资金工作，今天本报发表的中央铁道部材料局揭发的全国铁路材料的浪费现象，应该引起各地的注意。全国各个铁路管理局必须通过这次清理资产核定资金工作，认真地清理库存材料，把无用的或暂时不用的材料都应该弄清楚，实事求是地确定流动资金，为实行经济核算制打下良好基础。要作好这个工作，首先要加强整体观念。因此，坚决地反对局部观点，就成了目前全国铁路员工重要的斗争任务。
