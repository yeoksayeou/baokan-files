Focusing only on the present, ignoring the consequences; trying to alleviate disaster, but creating disaster.
Parts of Southern Sichuan actually use indiscriminate deforestation to provide disaster relief

In parts of the Southern Sichuan Administrative Region, local governments are using deforestation to provide famine relief, resulting in damage to forests. For example, in Gulan and Xuyong counties, a logging-for-relief campaign was launched in April. Gulan made plans for large-scale timber harvesting, and Xuyong established a Timber Production Disaster Relief Committee, organizing more than 2,600 laborers for logging. To solve the famine problem, the Luzhou Special District mobilized private merchants to enter the mountains and purchase large quantities of timber. For example, the Luzhou private Jianyuan Timber Joint Venture went to Jiang'an, Luobiao, Naxi and other places on April 4 to purchase timber, and bought 40,000 *juezi* of "Qingshan" near Naxi through farmers' associations, preparing to cut them down (*juezi* are small wooden boards used for roofing, serving the same purpose as acorns used for roofing in the north; *pi* means piece). The result of logging for disaster relief, especially when private merchants contract for harvesting, is that in areas with relatively convenient transportation, trees that have not yet grown up, trees on steep slopes, and trees by the river have all been cut down. This method of disaster relief is extremely wrong. It destroys the mountains and forests, will inevitably aggravate natural disasters, and even affect agricultural production. For example, one of the main reasons for the disaster in Southern Sichuan last year was flash floods, which destroyed farmland. After this indiscriminate deforestation this year, mountain floods will become even more severe, further harming downstream areas. Using this method for disaster relief will inevitably lead to even greater disasters. Therefore, the aforementioned local governments in the Southern Sichuan Administrative Region should immediately correct this phenomenon of indiscriminately felling forests in the name of disaster relief, and solve the famine problem by organizing the masses to engage in various sideline and handicraft production.

　　只顾眼前，不顾后果；为了救灾，却是造灾。
    川南部分地区竟用滥伐山林办法救灾
    川南行政区部分地方政府用砍伐山林办法来救济灾荒，使森林遭受破坏。如古兰，叙永等县，在四月间曾开展伐木救灾运动。古兰作出了大量采伐木材的计划，叙永成立了伐木生产救灾委员会，组织民工二千六百余人进行伐木。泸州专区为解决灾荒问题，发动私商入山大量收购木材。如泸州私营建源木业联营社于四月四日分赴江安、洛表、纳溪等地收购木材，并在纳溪附近通过农民协会买了四万匹桷子的“青山”准备砍伐（按桷子即盖房用的一种小木板，与北方盖房用的橡子起同样作用；匹即块的意思）。伐木救灾特别是私商包揽采伐的结果，在交通比较方便的地区，还未长大的树，陡坡上的树，河边的树，都被砍伐完了。这种救灾的办法是极端错误的，既破坏了山林，必将加重自然灾害，以致影响农业生产。例如去年造成川南灾荒的主要原因之一就是山洪暴发，冲毁了农田。今年这样滥伐山林以后，山洪水灾将会愈加厉害，更将贻害了河流下游地区。用这种办法救灾，必然是越救灾越大。因此，川南行政区上述地方政府应即纠正此种因救灾而乱伐山林的现象，并从组织群众进行各种副业与手工业生产来解决灾荒问题。（林利）
