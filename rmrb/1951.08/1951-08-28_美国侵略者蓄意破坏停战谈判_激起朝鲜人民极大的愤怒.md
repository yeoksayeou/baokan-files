　　American Aggressors Deliberately Sabotage Armistice Negotiations
    Arousing Extreme Indignation Among the Korean People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 27th] The American aggressors' deliberate sabotage of the armistice negotiations, repeated violations of the Kaesong neutral zone, attacks on our military police, and bombing of our delegation's residence have aroused extreme indignation among the Korean people.
    Zhang Shounan, a worker at a factory in Pyongyang, said: The American aggressors' outrageous and bestial atrocities cannot but make our Korean working class extremely angry. We firmly support General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai's solemn protest to Ridgway. Let the good people of the world judge who is the enemy of human peace. We Korean workers will never be intimidated by any of the heinous atrocities of American imperialism.
    Park Young-soo, a farmer in the Linwon District of West Pyongyang, said: In order to sabotage the armistice negotiations, the American bandits have fabricated such vile beastly acts, making people more clearly recognize the hideous faces of the invading bandits. During the armistice negotiations, the American devils have constantly bombed and strafed our peaceful towns and villages in the rear of Korea. Now, they are actually acting violently towards our negotiating representatives; the devils really have no humanity at all. We Korean people love peace, but what we demand is genuine peace. The American bandits should know that the Korean people's patience is limited. The aggressors' atrocities will not gain anything except to arouse the indignation of the people of the world.
    Lu Rishan, a teacher at Pyongyang Municipal Fifth Middle School, said: The American aggressors' crime of openly sabotaging the armistice negotiations further exposes their ferocious face of being determined to be enemies of peace-loving people all over the world. We Korean people are soberly watching the actions of the American bandits during the armistice negotiations. The Korean people will never forget the blood feud with the American aggressors. If the American aggressors do not give a satisfactory reply to General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai's solemn protest and are unwilling to guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future, then the Americans must bear full responsibility for sabotaging the armistice negotiations and all the consequences arising therefrom.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 27th] The "Labor News" published an editorial on the 26th entitled "The US Imperialists Must Bear Full Responsibility for the Repeated Violations and Bombings of the Kaesong Neutral Zone," saying: The Korean armistice negotiations, which were held under the gaze of peace-loving people all over the world, have fallen into a serious crisis because the Americans are not only unwilling to abandon their aggressive ambitions and are playing tricks with no sincerity, but even sabotaging the negotiations.
    The editorial pointed out: The Korean people have made unremitting efforts with all kinds of patience in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and achieve success in the Kaesong armistice negotiations. However, the American imperialist aggressors have instead thought that the Korean people's sincere attitude is a sign of weakness. At the conference table, they insisted on their absurd proposal regarding the military demarcation line, which is absolutely unacceptable to the Korean people, and delayed the progress of the negotiations. At the same time, they violated the agreements between the two sides outside the conference table and created a series of heinous crimes, and attempted to evade the responsibility they should bear. The editorial concluded by saying: If the US imperialists do not show sincerity with their actual actions and dare to break off the armistice negotiations, then they must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom. In this way, they will not only further arouse the anger and resistance of the Korean people, but also arouse further opposition from peace-loving people all over the world.

　　美国侵略者蓄意破坏停战谈判
    激起朝鲜人民极大的愤怒
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】美国侵略者蓄意破坏停战谈判，一再侵犯开城中立区，袭击我军事警察，并轰炸我方代表团住所。这些卑鄙无耻的行为，已经激起了朝鲜人民极大的愤怒。
    平壤某工厂工人张寿南说：美国侵略者这种丧尽天良的野兽暴行，不能不使我们朝鲜工人阶级万分愤怒。我们坚决拥护金日成将军与彭德怀将军向李奇微提出的严正抗议。谁是人类和平的敌人，让全世界的善良人民来判断吧。我们朝鲜工人是绝不会被美帝国主义的任何穷凶极恶的暴行所吓倒的。
    西平壤林原区农民朴英洙说：美国强盗为了破坏停战谈判，竟然制造了这种卑劣的兽行，使人们更加认清了侵略强盗的狰狞嘴脸。在停战谈判期中，美国鬼子不断地到我们朝鲜后方的和平城乡来狂炸滥射。现在，居然向我们的谈判代表逞凶，鬼子们实在连一点人性也没有了。我们朝鲜人民热爱和平，但是，我们所要求的是真正的和平。美国强盗应该知道：我们朝鲜人民的忍耐性是有限度的。侵略者的暴行，除了激起全世界人民的愤怒之外，是什么也得不到的。
    平壤市立第五中学教员卢日善说：美国侵略者公开破坏停战谈判的罪行，更加暴露了他们决心与全世界爱好和平的人民为敌的凶恶面目。我们朝鲜人民在停战谈判期间清醒地注视着美国强盗的一举一动。朝鲜人民永远不会忘记对美国侵略者的血海深仇。如果美国侵略者对金日成将军与彭德怀将军的严正抗议没有圆满的答复，不愿保证今后不再发生类似事件的话；那么，破坏停战谈判以及由此引起的一切后果，都要由美国人负完全责任。
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】《劳动新闻》二十六日以《美帝必须负起屡次侵犯与轰炸开城中立区事件的全责》为题，发表社论说：在全世界爱好和平的人民的注视中举行的朝鲜停战谈判，由于美国人不仅不愿放弃其侵略野心，玩弄毫无诚意的伎俩，甚至破坏谈判，以致陷入了严重的危机。
    社论指出：朝鲜人民为使朝鲜问题和平解决，使开城停战谈判获得成就，已经百般忍耐地作了不懈的努力。但是，美帝国主义侵略者反而以为朝鲜人民的诚意态度是软弱的表示，他们在会场内坚持其绝不可能为朝鲜人民所接受的关于军事分界线的荒谬提案，拖延谈判的进行；同时，在会场外破坏双方的协议，制造了一连串的凶恶罪行，并企图规避其所应负的责任。社论最后说：如果美帝国主义者不以其实际行动表示诚意，竟敢使停战谈判破裂的话；那么，由此引起的一切后果，必须由他们负完全责任。这样，他们就不仅将更加激起朝鲜人民的愤怒与抗击，而且将引起全世界爱好和平的人民进一步的反对。
