To our beloved Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

The entire staff of the People's Liberation Army No. 6 Automobile Manufacturing Plant, with great excitement, reports to you on the occasion of the 24th anniversary of the founding of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army: Under your wise leadership, we have overcome technical difficulties and ideological obstacles, and have successfully trial-manufactured the first batch of heavy-duty military motorcycles in Chinese history through our own efforts. We have decided to dedicate this batch of vehicles to the motherland on this year's "August 1st" Army Day to enhance the strength of the heroic and battle-tested People's Liberation Army to defend the motherland, defend peace, and defend the fruits of victory.

Our motorcycle trial production began in mid-March of this year. Due to the lack of machinery, equipment, and technical conditions, we encountered various difficulties. However, thanks to the encouragement of the leaders of the General Logistics Department and the concerted efforts of the Party, government, labor union, the Communist Youth League, and all employees, we successfully completed the trial production ahead of schedule on July 20th. Before assembly, all parts were thoroughly tested. After assembly, two long-distance trips of approximately 600 kilometers were made on the roads between Beijing and Liangxiang, and between Beijing and Tianjin. The results proved that the vehicle's performance is flexible, durable, strong, and powerful, making it very suitable for use by the troops.

This glorious achievement shows that the wisdom and strength of the Chinese working class, who have become the masters of New China, are infinite! But this can only be brought into play under the correct and wise leadership of the Party and you. Glory belongs to our Party, and glory belongs to our most beloved leader—Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

The initial successful trial production of motorcycles is only the first step in our mass production to meet the urgent needs of the troops. To strive for the realization of mass production, it is estimated that we will encounter many difficulties in the future, but we are determined to make even greater efforts to complete this glorious task. We firmly believe that under your wise leadership, we have unparalleled courage and confidence, and there are no insurmountable difficulties before us! We are determined to guard against arrogance and rashness, be humble and prudent, to motivate ourselves, and to successfully complete every task assigned to us! Striving to improve and strengthen the equipment of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Respectfully wishing you good health!

Respectfully dedicated by all the staff of the People's Liberation Army No. 6 Automobile Manufacturing Plant
July 30, 1951

　　在首都庆祝建军节大会上
    解放军第六汽车制配厂职工代表颂词
    敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    中国人民解放军第六汽车制配厂的全体职工，在伟大的中国人民解放军建军二十四周年的节日，以十分兴奋的心情谨向你们报告：在你们的英明领导下，我们克服了技术上的困难和思想上的障碍，用自己的力量试造成功了中国人民有史以来第一批重型军用机器脚踏车。并决定在今年的“八一”建军节日把这批车敬献给祖国；以增强英勇善战的人民解放军，保卫祖国，保卫和平，保卫胜利果实的力量。
    我们的机器脚踏车在本年三月中旬开始试造，由于机具设备以及技术条件的不足，曾遇到种种困难；但经过后勤首长的鼓励和党、政、工、团与全体职工一致的努力，毕竟于七月二十日胜利地提前试制成功了。全车除在装配前，对零件作过详尽的试验以外，并在装配完成后，在北京、良乡及北京、天津间的道路上，作了两次约六百公里的长途行驶，结果证明车的性能灵便耐用、强固有力，很适合于部队使用。
    这个光荣的成绩，说明作了新中国主人的中国工人阶级的智慧和力量是无穷的！但这只有在党和你们的正确英明领导下，才能发挥出来，光荣属于我们的党，光荣属于我们最敬爱的领袖——毛主席、朱总司令。
    机器脚踏车的初步试制成功，仅是我们大量生产以供应部队急切需要的第一步。为了争取大量生产的实现，估计今后是会遇到不少困难的，但我们决心以更大的努力来完成这一光荣的任务。我们深信，在你们的英明领导下，我们有无比的勇气和信心，在我们面前没有克服不了的困难！我们决心戒骄戒躁、谦虚谨慎，来激励自己，把你们交给的每一个任务都胜利地完成！为改善与加强伟大中国人民解放军的装备而奋斗！
    敬祝健康！
          中国人民解放军第六汽车制配厂全体职工敬献
            一九五一年七月三十日
