　　(I) Editor:
　　I completely agree with the opinion in the People's Daily editorial of July 27th, "Strict Discipline and Law, Struggle to Defend National Property and the Purity of State Organs!" Our people across the country, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, are working diligently and hard to build our motherland. However, there are still a few bad elements who have infiltrated our state organs and are engaging in illegal and undisciplined behavior, corruption, and embezzlement, causing great losses to state property; Chen Juhong is an example. This cannot but make every Chinese person feel extremely saddened and angry.
　　Chen Juhong, as a government worker, colluded with unscrupulous merchants in embezzlement and malfeasance in order to satisfy his personal corrupt lifestyle. He stole a large amount of state property for his own enjoyment and pleasure. At this time, the Chinese People's Volunteers were fighting the American invading army in extremely difficult conditions to defend the motherland and world peace, and the entire Chinese people were vigorously using various practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country, yet Chen Juhong was corrupt, embezzling, and harming the country. This is something we can never tolerate. The government's death sentence is completely correct, and I wholeheartedly support it.
　　The Chen Juhong embezzlement incident should arouse our vigilance. We should not only severely punish the corrupt officials who have been discovered, but also strengthen the inspection system in our work, eliminate embezzlement and waste, and fight to defend state property.

　　(II) Editor:
　　After reading the People's Daily editorial entitled "Strict Discipline and Law, Struggle to Defend National Property and the Purity of State Organs!" and the news about Chen Juhong's crimes of corruption, I feel very indignant about Chen Juhong's corruption, malfeasance, depraved and corrupt behavior. I fully support the government's handling of him.
　　Chen Juhong, for his personal enjoyment, disregarded the interests of the people, and used his power to engage in corruption and malfeasance, causing serious damage to state property. This lesson is worthy of attention by all our revolutionary cadres. We must raise our vigilance and wage an uncompromising struggle against illegal acts of corruption and malfeasance at all times; at the same time, we must also strictly guard against the erosion of these hedonistic and corrupt thoughts, and maintain our fine tradition of hard work and plain living. We must fight to defend state property, so that the construction of our new China can develop more smoothly.

　　(III) Editor:
　　I wholeheartedly express my support for the correct handling of the Chen Juhong embezzlement case and the Xiao Ziyan and other cases of theft of state property by the government as reported in the People's Daily. Chen Juhong, Xiao Ziyan, and others, as government workers, not only did not honestly serve the people, but instead used their positions to collude with unscrupulous merchants, engage in corruption and malfeasance, and embezzle huge sums of money, causing great losses to state property. Such serious illegal acts are absolutely not allowed to happen under the leadership of the People's Government. Therefore, the government's death sentence for Chen and Xiao is completely correct.
　　These two incidents should attract the attention of our leading organs at all levels and revolutionary workers. Staff members of various agencies should learn from these incidents, raise their political awareness, better serve the people, and fight against illegal acts of corruption and theft of state property!

### 拥护政府严惩贪污犯！

　　拥护政府严惩贪污犯！
  （一）编辑同志：
    我完全同意七月二十七日人民日报社论“严肃法纪，为保卫国家财产和国家机关的纯洁而斗争！”中的意见。我们全国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，正在辛劳勤苦地为建设我们的祖国而努力。但还有少数坏分子，混进我们的国家机关，进行违法乱纪、贪污腐化的勾当，使国家财产受到很大的损失；像陈居洪就是一个例子。这不能不使每一个中国人民都感到无比的痛心和愤怒。
    陈居洪身为政府工作人员。他为了满足个人腐化生活，勾结奸商贪污舞弊。他盗窃大批国家财产，供自己吃喝玩乐。就在这个时候，中国人民志愿军为了保卫祖国、保卫世界和平，正在极端艰苦的环境下打击着美国侵略军队，全中国人民正在轰轰烈烈地用各种实际行动来抗美援朝保家卫国，而陈居洪却贪污腐化危害国家，这是我们决不能容忍的。政府处以死刑是完全正确的，我衷心拥护。
    陈居洪贪污事件，应该引起我们的警惕。我们不但应该给已经被发现的贪污犯以严重处理，并且应该在我们的工作中加强检查制度，杜绝贪污浪费，为保卫国家财产而斗争。
            王天荣
  （二）编辑同志：
    看了人民日报以“严肃法纪，为保卫国家财产和国家机关的纯洁而斗争！”为题的社论及关于陈居洪贪污罪行的新闻后，我对陈居洪这种贪污舞弊、堕落腐化的行为感到非常激愤。我完全拥护政府对他的处理。
    陈居洪为了个人享受，毫不顾人民的利益，利用职权贪污舞弊，使国家财产受到严重的损害。这个教训，是值得我全体革命干部注意的。我们必须提高警惕，随时和贪污舞弊的不法行为作不妥协的斗争；同时，自己还应该严防这些享乐腐化思想的侵蚀，保持我们艰苦朴素的优良传统。我们要为保卫国家财产而斗争，使我们新中国的建设事业更顺利地向前发展。
            中央人民政府财政部  刘秀珍
  （三）编辑同志：
    看到了人民日报所载政府对陈居洪贪污案与萧子言等盗窃国家财产案件正确的处理，我衷心表示拥护。陈居洪、萧子言等身为政府工作人员，不但不老老实实为人民服务，反利用职务上的方便与奸商合谋，贪污舞弊，私吞巨款，使国家财产遭受了很大损失。这种严重的犯法行为，在人民政府领导下是绝对不允许它发生的。因此，政府对陈犯、萧犯等处以死刑是完全正确的。
    这两个事件，应该引起我们各级领导机关和革命工作人员的注意。各级机关工作人员应从这事件中接受教训，提高政治觉悟，更好地为人民服务，并和贪污与盗窃国家财产的不法行为作斗争！
