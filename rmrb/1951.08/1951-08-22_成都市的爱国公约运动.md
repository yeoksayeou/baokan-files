　　Chengdu's Patriotic Pledge Campaign
       Ruan Yunxi
    The patriotic pledge campaign in Chengdu is gradually becoming widespread. As of early August, it is estimated that approximately 400,000 people have participated in formulating patriotic pledges. Most of these pledges are made by factories at the workshop and team levels, schools at the department and grade levels, residents at the group and family levels, and government organizations at the department level. In each district, the patriotic pledges made by residents at the group or family level generally account for more than 80 percent of the total population. Since June, various organizations, factories, schools, and residents in each district have successively begun to inspect the implementation of the patriotic pledges. In July, each district carried out key spot checks in a more organized manner and universally mobilized the masses to revise or supplement them.

    According to the preliminary inspection materials of various units, the patriotic pledges previously formulated generally played a role in mobilizing and organizing people. Among them, those patriotic pledges that were formulated on the basis of mass discussion and awareness, with practical and specific content (estimated to account for only 20%), truly became the concrete patriotic action guidelines for the people, promoting production, work, and study. In factories, taking Yuhua Yarn Factory as an example, the factory has a total of 56 trade union member groups, and 44 groups have formulated patriotic pledges. Most groups have achieved results in implementing patriotic pledges. Some groups have reduced defective cloth by half, and some workers have increased from weaving 60 yards of cloth per day to 92 yards. The factory's output has increased from 120 bolts of cloth to 150 bolts. All factory employees have subscribed to 78 more newspapers than in the past and have universally established newspaper reading groups. In schools, through the formulation of patriotic pledges, many teachers have overcome the past phenomenon of "each doing his own thing" in teaching, implemented observation teaching, and improved teaching methods. In the industrial and commercial sectors, in the implementation of patriotic pledges, monthly taxes were basically cleared, and most of the last year's tax arrears were paid up. Among residents, most have incorporated strengthening political and cultural learning into their patriotic pledges, increased learning enthusiasm, and improved learning organizations. The majority of citizens have organized to participate in urban construction work, such as renovating streets and dredging ditches and wells, improving family hygiene and environmental hygiene. At the same time, patriotic pledges have further promoted the use of criticism and self-criticism among people of all strata, strengthened residents' unity, and harmonized families.

    The formulation of patriotic pledges has further greatly promoted the development of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. A large number of activists among the masses have participated in the city's propaganda work, and many people have reported counter-revolutionaries. A worker in the Fourth District who engraved seals helped the government arrest twelve special agents and bandits in the course of implementing patriotic pledges.

    On the other hand, during the inspection of patriotic pledges, it was also found that the formulation of most patriotic pledges did not go through mass deliberation and discussion, but was only drafted by a few activists. Some individual street patriotic pledges were even copied from each other. The articles and content of these patriotic pledges are mostly abstract and empty, and not easy to implement. Some patriotic pledges look concrete, but they are not in line with the actual situation. For example, one residents' group included in their patriotic pledge "not to listen to the Voice of America and Taiwan radio broadcasts," but this residents' group did not have a radio. The content of some patriotic pledges is limited to their daily business or falls into the scope of life details, lacking or completely devoid of political content, such as some including the time of meals in the four seasons, not littering, and not spitting everywhere as articles of the patriotic pledge. In addition, some patriotic pledges were shelved after being formulated, without implementation or inspection, and participants could not even remember the articles.

    After the July inspection and revision of the patriotic pledge campaign, the content of these patriotic pledges has become clearer and more specific than before, further exerting the role of promoting work. Preliminary results have been achieved in donating airplanes and cannons and doing a good job in preferential treatment work. All revised patriotic pledges generally have added the content of increasing production and donations and preferential treatment work. Increasing production and donations and preferential treatment work have become mass movements. Residents in individual regions have spontaneously organized labor service groups, regularly serving the families of martyrs and soldiers.

    Chengdu has gained some experience in promoting patriotic pledges in this inspection of patriotic pledges: First, the lack of understanding of the political significance of patriotic pledges among the masses is a major reason why patriotic pledges cannot be earnestly formulated and implemented. Therefore, in the formulation, inspection, and revision of patriotic pledges, propaganda work must be done well. First of all, propagandists and propaganda activists among the masses must understand the significance and method of formulating patriotic pledges, and then conduct universal and in-depth propaganda among the masses, so that the masses understand why patriotic pledges should be formulated, what content they should include, how to formulate them, and how to implement them. Second, if cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the role of patriotic pledges in practical work and neglect leadership of this work, it will affect the development of the patriotic pledge movement. Therefore, leading organizations should educate cadres from a theoretical point of view on the one hand, and find typical examples to educate cadres on the other, so that cadres clearly recognize that patriotic pledges are an important form to enhance and consolidate the patriotic enthusiasm of the people and continue to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea and promote various national construction works. Then mobilize cadres to earnestly and concretely help the masses to do this work well. Third, the work of revising patriotic pledges should generally first carry out key experiments, gain experience, and promote the general. When carrying out a comprehensive revision, each district can divide the areas under its jurisdiction into several sections according to the actual situation of the area, according to the nature of production or business, and send cadres to directly lead and help the masses to carry out the revision work. In the case of a limited number of cadres, the Second District mobilized activists among residents and representatives who earnestly implemented patriotic pledges to lead the revision of patriotic pledges, and organized them to form "mutual aid groups" to concretely help other residents to carry out the revision work. The effect of this method is very good and worthy of promotion. (Attached picture)

Therefore, it was commended by the superiors and won the glorious title of "Hero Company of Huangju North Mountain."

### 成都市的爱国公约运动

　　成都市的爱国公约运动
       阮永熙
    成都市的爱国公约运动已逐渐走向普及，到八月初止，估计已参加制订爱国公约的约有四十万人，其中以工厂的车间、小组，学校的系、级，居民的小组、家庭，机关中一个部门为单位订立爱国公约的占多数。各区居民以小组或家庭为单位订立爱国公约的，一般已占全区人数的百分之八十以上。六月份以来，各机关、工厂、学校以及各区居民，先后开始检查爱国公约的执行情况。七月份内，各区更有领导地进行了重点抽查，并普遍发动群众修订或补订。
    根据各单位初步检查爱国公约的材料来看，以前所订立的爱国公约，一般的都起了号召与组织作用。其中凡是经过群众讨论，在自觉的基础上订立，内容切实具体的爱国公约（估计只占十分之二），就真正成了人民群众的具体的爱国行动纲领，推动了生产、工作和学习。在工厂中，以裕华纱厂为例，该厂共有五十六个工会会员小组，四十四个小组订立了爱国公约，大部分小组均在执行爱国公约中获得了成绩。有的小组次布减少了一半，有的工人由每天织六十码布提高到九十二码，全厂的产量由一百二十匹布增加到一百五十匹；全厂职工比过去增订了七十八份报纸，普遍建立了读报组。在学校中，通过订立爱国公约，不少教师克服了过去在教学上“各自为政”的现象，实行了观摩教学，改进了教学方法。工商界在执行爱国公约中，基本上作到了月税月清，并补交了去年欠税的大部分。在居民中，大都把加强政治、文化学习订入了爱国公约，提高了学习情绪，健全了学习组织。广大市民组织起来参加了市区的建设工作，如翻修街道、疏沟淘井等，改善了家庭卫生和环境卫生。同时，爱国公约更推动了各阶层人民使用批评与自我批评的武器，加强了居民团结，和睦了家庭。
    爱国公约的订立，更大大推动了抗美援朝运动的发展。群众中的大批积极分子参加了市区的宣传工作，许多人检举了反革命分子。四区一个刻图章的工人，在执行爱国公约中帮助政府逮捕了十二个特务与匪首。
    另一方面，在检查爱国公约中，也发现多数爱国公约的订立，并未经过群众酝酿讨论，而只是由少数积极分子拟定的。甚至有个别街道的爱国公约是互相传抄的。这些爱国公约的条文与内容大都抽象空洞，不易执行。也有些爱国公约，看起来倒也具体，但不切合实际情况，如有的居民小组，在爱国公约中订了一条“不收听美国之音和台湾广播”，但这个居民小组中并没有收音机。有些爱国公约的内容，则局限于自己的日常业务，或陷于生活细节的范围内，缺乏或全无政治内容，如有的把一年四季吃饭的时间，不丢纸屑、不乱吐痰等等也作为爱国公约的条文。此外，有些爱国公约制订后随即置之高阁，没有执行，也没有检查，参加订约者连条文也记不得了。
    经过七月份的检查、修订爱国公约运动，这些爱国公约内容已较前明确具体，进一步发挥了推动工作的作用。在捐献飞机大炮和作好优抚工作中，已取得初步的成绩。凡是已经修订的爱国公约，一般都增加了增产捐献和优抚工作的内容，增产捐献和优抚工作已成为群众性的运动。个别区域的居民自动组织了劳动服务小组，经常为烈属军属服务。
    成都市在这次爱国公约的检查中，取得了一些推行爱国公约的经验：第一、群众对于爱国公约的政治意义认识不足，是不能认真订立和执行爱国公约的一个主要原因。因此在订立、检查和修订爱国公约时，都必须作好宣传工作。首先要使宣传员和群众中的宣传积极分子明白订立爱国公约的意义和办法，然后向群众进行普遍的、深入的宣传，使群众明白为什么要订立爱国公约，它应该包括那些内容，怎样订立和怎样执行。第二、如果干部对于爱国公约在实际工作中所发挥的作用认识不足，忽视对于这一工作的领导，就会影响爱国公约运动的开展，因此领导机关应该一方面从理论上教育干部，一方面找出典型事例来教育干部，使干部明确认识爱国公约是提高与巩固人民群众爱国热情，继续加强抗美援朝和推进国家各种建设工作的重要形式。然后动员干部，认真地，具体地帮助群众去做好这一工作。第三、修订爱国公约的工作，一般应先作好重点实验，取得经验，以推动一般。在进行全面修订时，各区可按照所辖区域内的实际情况，按生产或业务的性质，划分若干段，分段派出干部直接领导和帮助群众进行修订工作。在干部人数有限的情况下，二区发动居民中的积极分子和认真执行爱国公约的代表人物，带领修订爱国公约，并组织他们成立“互助小组”，具体帮助其他居民进行修订工作，这种办法所收效果很好，值得推广。（附图片）
