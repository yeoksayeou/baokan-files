　　As a result of the Gasperi government's pursuit of traitorous policies,
    Italian Machine Industry Severely Declines
    [Reported by this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Under the American economic aggression, Italy's machine manufacturing industry has severely declined.

    Vittorio, Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, pointed out: In 1950, the production volume of Italian railway equipment decreased by 42% compared to 1949, tractors decreased by 24%, textile machinery decreased by 20%, electric motors decreased by 15.2%, and machine tools decreased by 5.2%. At the same time, imports of industrial equipment increased from 1,890 tons in 1949 to 12,700 tons in 1950, of which 88% came from the United States.

    This is the result of the Italian ruling clique's long-term destruction of the national machine industry. Since the Gasperi government returned to power on July 26, it has intensified its policies to strangle Italy's heavy industry. Currently, the large-scale "Breda" mechanical factory in Milan, under the jurisdiction of the government's "Industrial Reconstruction Bureau," has been ordered to prepare for closure. The renowned "Ansaldo" shipyard in Genoa, also under the jurisdiction of this "Industrial Reconstruction Bureau," is preparing to reduce production due to a lack of orders. The "Nibiolo" factory in Turin, Italy's only producer of printing presses, is facing the threat of bankruptcy and closure; and the privately owned "Savigliano" machine factory in Turin is also forced to reduce production. Thousands of workers are about to be laid off in all these factories.

　　加斯贝利政府执行卖国政策结果
    意大利机器工业已极度萎缩
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：在美国经济侵略下，意大利的机器制造工业已极度萎缩。
    意大利总工会总书记维多里奥指出：一九五○年意大利铁路装备的生产量已比一九四九年减少了百分之四十二，拖拉机减少了百分之二十四，纺织机器减少了百分之二十，电动机百分之十五点二，工作母机百分之五点二。同时，工业设备的输入却从一九四九年的一千八百九十吨增加到一九五○年的一万二千七百吨，其中百分之八十八是从美国来的。
    这是意大利统治集团长期摧残民族机器工业的结果。而加斯贝利政府在七月二十六日重新上台以后，更是变本加厉地推行绞杀意大利重工业的政策。现在，由政府“工业复兴局”管辖的规模庞大的米兰“布雷达”机械工厂，已奉命准备关闭。同属这个“工业复兴局”管辖的有名的热那亚“安莎尔多”造船厂，因为接不到定货单，也在准备紧缩生产。意大利唯一生产印刷机的大工厂——都灵的“尼比罗”工厂，正在受着破产关厂的威胁；而私营的都灵“萨维里阿诺”机器工厂，也被迫紧缩生产。在所有这些工厂中都有成千工人即将被解雇。
