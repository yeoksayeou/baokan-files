Urgent Prevention of Encephalitis

Encephalitis has already occurred in Beijing and Tianjin. August and September are the seasons when this epidemic is most prevalent. To protect the people's health, everyone should mobilize immediately.

Eliminate mosquitoes, as they are the vector for transmitting this disease. To effectively eliminate mosquitoes, in addition to paying attention to indoor and outdoor sanitation, the most important thing is to clear standing water and "turn over pots and jars, and block tree holes" to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds.

This summer's sanitation campaign in the capital has been successful. However, it is worth noting that the military, government agencies, organizations, and factories do not pay enough attention to this work and are not as active and serious as the citizens. Among the citizens, large households are not as diligent as small households. Now, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has taken emergency measures to prevent epidemic encephalitis, requiring all agencies and households in the city, without exception, to mobilize and carry out a concentrated prevention effort in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal People's Government.

In large cities like Beijing and Tianjin, where the population is highly concentrated, to prevent and eliminate the spread of epidemic diseases, everyone must be responsible. No agency or household can be even slightly negligent or complacent; otherwise, the spread of the epidemic will endanger the lives of all the people in the city, and no one will be able to escape it.

Therefore, we especially urge all Party, government, military, and civilian agencies and organizations in the capital, together with the masses from all walks of life, to take action, earnestly value, and do a good job in this work related to the safety of all the people in the city, and fight to prevent and eliminate the spread of epidemic encephalitis!

　　紧急预防脑炎
    流行性脑炎，已经在北京和天津发生。八、九两月，正是这种病疫最流行的季节。为了保护人民的健康，大家应立即动员起来。
    消灭蚊子，因为它是传染这种疾病的媒介。为了有效地灭蚊，除了注意户内户外的清洁卫生工作外，最要紧的是清除积水并要“翻盆倒罐、堵死树洞”消灭蚊子的窝巢。
    今年夏季首都卫生运动是有成绩的。但值得注意的，是部队、机关、团体、工厂对这一工作不够重视，不像市民那样积极认真；在市民之中，大户又不如小户，现在，北京市人民政府为了预防流行性脑炎，已采取紧急措施，要求全市所有的机关和住户，都无例外地动员起来，按照市人民政府的指示，进行突击的预防工作。
    在北京、天津这样的大城市，人口很集中，要预防和消灭流行性疾病的传染，必须大家负责，任何机关或住户，都不能有丝毫松懈麻痹，否则病疫蔓延，是要危害全市人民的生命安全，谁也逃避不了的。
    因此，我们特别要求首都党政军民各机关和团体，与各界群众一齐动手，认真重视和作好这个有关全市人民安全的工作，为预防与消灭流行性脑炎的传染而斗争！
