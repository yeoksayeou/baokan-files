A newsletter from Hebei Province regarding the political education work conducted among peasants during the sale and storage of cotton movement presents two different methods of politically mobilizing peasants, which are worthy of study by various regions. This will be of significant help in resolving the issue of how to conduct political education for peasants in the future.

Facts from various regions prove that wherever Party organizations strengthen their leadership and conduct thorough political education among peasants, they generally succeed in completing the tasks of selling and storing cotton, while also greatly elevating the peasants politically. However, there are also many regions where the political tasks are mechanically and rigidly combined with the tasks of selling and storing cotton. These comrades are not good at using persuasive and enlightening methods to educate peasants and make them realize that selling and storing cotton is a matter of their own interests, nor are they good at using the peasants' own interests and life experiences to carry out political mobilization. They only know how to shout empty slogans of "Resist America, Aid Korea" and "Love the Country," but in reality, they are developing commandism and coercive practices against the masses. As reflected in the Hebei Province newsletter, sayings like "Not selling cotton is being a little Chiang Kai-shek" and "Hoarding cotton is helping America" are extremely bad examples. Under the domination of this erroneous thinking, erroneous practices such as "selling by a deadline" and "searching house by house" inevitably occur.

In order to study the experience of the Party's political education work for peasants and help cadres improve their understanding of the mass line, we hope that various regions will seriously examine and summarize the political education work in the cotton sale and storage movement, promote various correct experiences, and criticize various erroneous tendencies. All Party and non-Party cadres who participated in this cotton sale and storage movement can write down their experiences in conducting political education for peasants and submit them to this newspaper for publication, to vigorously launch a discussion on the political education work for peasants in the cotton sale and storage work, and help examine and summarize this work.

### 检查在售棉储棉中党对农民的政治教育工作

　　检查在售棉储棉中党对农民的政治教育工作
    河北省在售棉储棉运动中对农民进行政治教育工作的一篇通讯，提出了两种不同的对农民进行政治动员的方法，值得各地研究，这对于解决今后如何对农民进行政治教育问题，会有重要的帮助。
    各地事实证明：凡是党组织加强领导，对农民进行充分的政治教育的地区，一般的都能顺利完成售棉储棉任务，同时也在政治上把农民大大提高了一步。但是另外也有很多地区存在着把政治任务同售棉储棉任务机械地生硬结合的现象，这些同志不善于用说服启发的方法去教育农民认识售棉储棉是有关农民本身利益的事情，也不善于通过农民的切身利益和生活体验去进行政治动员，他们只知道空洞地喊“抗美援朝”、“爱国”的口号，实际上却是发展了命令主义和强制群众的作风，像河北省通讯中所反映的：“有棉不卖就是小蒋介石”，“放着棉花就是帮助美国”等，都是一些极端恶劣的例子。在这种错误思想支配下，也就必然会出现“限期出卖”、“挨户搜查”等等错误的作法。
    为了研究党对农民的政治教育工作的经验，并帮助干部提高对群众路线的认识，我们希望各地认真检查和总结售棉储棉运动中的政治教育工作，发扬各种正确的经验，批判各种错误倾向。凡是参加这次售棉储棉运动的党和非党干部，都可以写出自己对农民进行政治教育的经验，寄交本报发表，热烈地展开关于在售棉储棉工作中对农民进行政治教育工作的讨论，帮助检查和总结这个工作。
