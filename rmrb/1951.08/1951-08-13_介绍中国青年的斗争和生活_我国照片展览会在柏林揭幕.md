Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 11th. The New China Photo Exhibition, organized by the Chinese youth delegation participating in the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival, opened on the 10th at the Social Insurance Building in Berlin. Those attending the opening ceremony included Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic; Wang Dawei, Minister of Education; representatives of the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries' diplomatic missions in Germany; Dennis, a representative of the Festival Committee; and more than 500 youth representatives from various countries. Ji Pengfei, head of the Chinese diplomatic mission in Germany, also attended. Dennis and Feng Wenbin, head of the Chinese youth delegation, both delivered short speeches.

A large banner hung at the exhibition: "Chinese Youth Advance Under the Banner of Mao Zedong!" The more than 400 photographs on display systematically introduce how Chinese youth, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and together with the entire people, actively participate in the work of building the motherland and the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, explaining the happy life of Chinese youth today and their contribution to defending peace. The exhibition also displayed the flags and epaulets of the American invading army captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front, leaving a deep impression on the audience. Dennis wrote in the guest book: "The many examples of the life and struggle of Chinese youth and the people reflected in the exhibition are what we should learn from." Dubraye, Vice Chairman of the Bulgarian Science, Art and Culture Committee, who visited the exhibition, said: "I hope the Bulgarian people will also have the opportunity to see such an exhibition."
