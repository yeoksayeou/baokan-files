Pay Attention to Mobilizing Women in Cotton Purchase and Storage
    Lán Cūn

In cotton-producing areas, rural women have a very close relationship with cotton. Every cotton farming household, after harvesting cotton each year, allocates a portion (around five to twenty jin of seed cotton) to the mistress of the house or daughter-in-law as their "private cotton," "small share," or "personal cotton," which they have complete control over. This portion of cotton is mostly used for spinning and weaving to provide clothing for themselves, their husbands, and children, or sold for personal spending money. These small shares may seem insignificant when dispersed, but because every cotton farming woman has them, the total amount cannot be ignored. It is estimated that the national cotton farming population is about forty to fifty million, forming about ten million households. Assuming one mistress per household, there are about ten million women. If each mistress stores an average of two jin of lint, the total would be twenty million jin of lint. Generally, wealthier farming families have more than enough small-share cotton to use in a year. Accumulated over the years, a single person can often accumulate dozens of jin of seed cotton. The amount of this is even more impossible to ignore.

Secondly, because most of the labor in cotton planting, such as seed selection, thinning, pruning, and harvesting, is done by women, they have a certain degree of control over the family's "large-share cotton" in addition to their own "small-share cotton." In many rural areas of Hebei, it is said that "men manage the food, women manage the clothing." In the cotton-producing areas of Pingyuan Province, there is also the saying, "Mules and horses belong to the men, cotton belongs to the women." According to a survey of several typical villages in Xingtai Prefecture, Hebei, the current cotton storage of the masses accounts for 10% of last year's cotton harvest. Most of this cotton is controlled by women. Based on these situations, mobilizing women will be very beneficial to the cotton purchase and storage work.

According to the experience of various places in June and July, villages that paid attention to mobilizing women generally carried out cotton purchase and storage work more smoothly and thoroughly. For example, in Hecun Village, Cheng'an, Hebei, middle peasants Wang Tian'en and Wang Tiantai each reported storing more than 1,000 jin of cotton in the cotton selling and storing movement, but they could not produce it because their wives were unwilling. Later, after mobilizing the women, they were all produced. Wangdao Village, Nangong County, mobilized women widely through the Women's Federation, purchasing and storing more than 15,000 jin of cotton in five days. In the cotton purchase work of Qiliying Village, Xinxiang County, Pingyuan, due to attention to mobilizing women, more than 300 women enthusiastically sold cotton collectively. They beat gongs and drums, shouting slogans such as "Love the country, sell cotton, don't keep a single flower at home!" "Stop spinning and weaving, control the oil drought (aphids), women selling cotton are models!" and sold their "private cotton" to the cooperatives. The women of Mengjiaying Village in the county not only sold their stored cotton, but also organized a transportation team of more than 60 people, working alongside the men to send cotton to the flower, yarn, and cloth company in the city. The active actions of the women in these two villages promoted the selling and storing of cotton in their villages and nearby villages. More than half of the people who went to the cotton stations to sell and store cotton every day in the six key cotton selling and storing villages in Xinxiang were women. In Dingzhuang Village, Wuqiao County, Shandong, women challenged each other at the mobilization meeting for selling cotton, and then went to various households to mobilize, bringing out all the "private cotton." As a result, the village sold more than 10,000 jin of cotton in one day.

From the above situation, mobilizing women is one of the important links that cannot be ignored in the cotton purchase and storage work. How to mobilize them? Based on the experience of various places, the following issues must be paid attention to:

(1) Correct the thinking of some cadres who are unwilling to do women's work. Generally, rural women participate in social and political activities less than men because they are burdened by family chores and children, and they have more concerns about selling and storing cotton. This makes some district and village cadres feel that mobilizing women is a difficult task and they are unwilling to put in much effort. Many district cadres in Liaodong Province said: "When I go to the countryside, I can complete any task given to me, but I cannot complete the task of mobilizing women." Some village cadres do not pay attention to inviting women to participate when convening mass meetings to mobilize cotton sales, and say, "It's okay whether they come or not." There are also many cadres who "see the big and not the small," looking down on small-share cotton, which is also the reason why they neglect to mobilize women. For these comrades, existing examples should be used for education, so that they understand that without mobilizing women, it is impossible to mobilize all the stored cotton in rural areas, and the completion of the entire cotton purchase task will encounter great obstacles.

(2) In mobilizing women to sell and store cotton, it is necessary to call on the activists of the rural democratic women's federations, female members of the Youth League, female labor models, etc. to go deep into various families to carry out very patient mobilization, and not be satisfied with the general calls at meetings.

Shi Da Niang of Datun Village, Dongguang County, Shandong, went deep into various farm households and used her own example of receiving more cotton due to the government's loan of soybean cakes for topdressing to mobilize other women to sell and store cotton, guiding everyone to recall the benefits of the People's Government to everyone. After the women understood, fourteen households sold 580 jin of cotton in three days. After Wang Fengying, a female Youth League member in Qu Xing Town, Fifth District, Chenliu, Henan, realized the importance of selling and storing cotton, she went to various households in the rain before dawn to mobilize women to sell cotton, bringing out all the "small-share cotton." Many farmers were moved by her spirit and actively sold their large-share cotton as well. As a result, the amount of cotton she mobilized on one street in two days was greater than the amount that the town government cadres estimated could be sold on all four streets in the town. Under her influence, the women in the town went out of the village to mobilize their relatives, which had a great effect. These examples all show that mobilizing female activists to go deep into farm households to mobilize is an important method for doing a good job in mobilizing general women and completing the task of cotton purchase and storage.

(3) Pay attention to meeting the women's own requirements. Many women are reluctant to sell their "small-share cotton" mainly because they want to keep it for spinning and weaving themselves, fearing that they will not be able to buy cloth back after selling the cotton, or that the money from selling the cotton will go to the family, and their clothing and daily necessities will become a problem. Therefore, in addition to carrying out ideological mobilization for women, the economic departments should do a good job in supplying the cloth and daily necessities that women need, especially the flower cloth, towels, socks, and other materials that women love, and should transport these materials to the countryside as much as possible for direct supply, so that women can sell cotton and buy goods without leaving the village. At the same time, it should be guaranteed that the money from selling "small-share cotton" belongs to the women, eliminating the women's concerns about selling cotton.

(4) Mobilizing women to sell and store cotton should be linked to mobilizing them to participate in agricultural production. According to the experience of Wu'an, Hebei, and other places, mobilizing women to exchange flowers for cloth and saving the time used for spinning and weaving to go to the fields for production is generally welcomed by farmers. Because farm work is too busy and there is a shortage of manpower, it is a common difficulty for cotton farmers at present. The work of controlling aphids requires the participation of many women. If the work of mobilizing women to go to the fields is done well, many farmers will encourage women to sell cotton.

### 购棉储棉中要注意发动妇女

　　购棉储棉中要注意发动妇女
    蓝村
    产棉区的农村妇女和棉花的关系非常密切。每个棉农家庭在每年收花之后，都要分出一份（籽棉五斤到二十斤左右）给主妇或媳妇，作为“私房花”、“小份花”或“体己花”，完全由妇女自己支配。这一部分棉花大部是用来纺织，供给自己和丈夫、孩子穿衣和自己卖了作零用钱。这些小份花分散着看起来数量很小，但因为每个棉农妇女都有，总的数量不可忽视。据估计全国棉农人口约四、五千万，约组成一千万个家庭。一个家庭以一个主妇计算，则约有一千万个。如以每个主妇平均存二斤皮棉计算，总起来就是二千万斤皮棉。一般较富裕的农家，妇女小份花一年用不完。年年积蓄，常有一人积到数十斤籽棉的。其数量更不可忽视。
    其次，因为种植棉花中的选籽、间苗、整枝打?、收花等劳动大部都由妇女担任，所以妇女除本身的“小份花”之外，对家庭的“大份花”大都也有一定程度的支配权。河北许多农村中是“男管吃，女管穿”。平原省产棉区也流行着“骡马是男人的，棉花是妇女的”的说法。据河北邢台专区几个典型村的调查，群众目前存棉量占去年收棉量的百分之十。这些棉花大部掌握在妇女手里。根据这些情况，如果把妇女动员起来，对购棉储棉工作是会有很大好处的。
    根据各地六、七月份的经验，凡是注意了发动妇女的村庄，购棉储棉工作一般开展得比较顺利、深入。如河北成安河町村中农王天恩、王天太在售棉储棉运动中各报存棉一千多斤，但都因为老婆不愿意，拿不出来。后来经过动员妇女，即全部拿了出来。南宫县王道寨村通过妇联会向妇女进行广泛动员，五天购储棉花一万五千多斤。平原新乡县七里营村购棉工作中，由于注意发动妇女，曾有三百多名妇女热烈地集体售棉。她们敲锣打鼓，高呼“爱国家，卖棉花，家中不留一点花！”“停纺织，治油旱（蚜虫），妇女卖花是模范！”等口号，把自己的“私房花”卖给合作社。该县孟家营村妇女不但售出了自己的存棉，还组织了六十多人的运输队，和男人们并肩往市内花纱布公司送花。该两村妇女的积极行动，推动了本村及附近村庄的售、储棉运动。新乡六个售储棉重点村每天到棉站售棉储棉的人，半数以上是妇女。山东吴桥县丁庄妇女们在动员售棉的大会上互相挑战，会后分头到各家动员，把“私房花”都动员出来了。结果，该村一天售花一万多斤。
    从以上情况看来，发动妇女是购棉储棉工作中不可忽视的重要环节之一。怎样发动呢？综合各地经验，必须注意以下几个问题：
    （一）纠正某些干部不愿意做妇女工作的思想。一般农村妇女因为受家庭琐事和孩子的牵累，过去参加社会政治活动比男人为少，对售棉储棉的顾虑也更多。这就使一些区村干部感到发动妇女是件难事，不肯多用力气去做。辽东省不少区干部说：“下乡的时候，给我什么任务都能完成，就是发动妇女的任务我完成不了。”有些村干部在召集群众会议动员售棉的时候，不注意找妇女参加，还说：“她们来不来都行。”还有许多干部“看大不看小”，瞧不起小份花，也是他们忽视发动妇女的原因。对于这些同志，应该拿已有的实例进行教育，使他们了解，不发动妇女，就不可能把农村中的存棉全部动员出来，整个购棉任务的完成就会遭遇很大障碍。
    （二）在发动妇女售棉储棉中，要号召农村中民主妇联的积极分子，女青年团员，女劳动模范等深入到各个家庭中进行十分耐心的动员，不能满足于一般会议上的号召。
    山东东光县大屯村石大娘深入各农户，用自己因政府贷给豆饼上追肥才多收了棉花的例子，去动员别的妇女售棉储棉，引导大家回想人民政府对各人的好处。妇女们想通了以后，三天内有十四户售棉五百八十斤。河南陈留五区曲兴镇女青年团员王凤英认识了售棉储棉的重要意义以后，天不明就冒着雨到各家去动员妇女售棉，把“小份花”都动员了出来。许多农民为她的精神所感动，纷纷把大份花也自动卖出。结果，她两天中在一道街上动员出来的棉花，比镇政府干部所估计的全镇四道街所能卖出的数目还大。该镇妇女在她的影响下，纷纷出村，到亲戚家去动员，收到很大效果。这些例子，都说明发动妇女积极分子深入农户去动员，是做好发动一般妇女工作和完成购棉储棉任务的重要方法。
    （三）要注意满足妇女本身的要求。有许多妇女舍不得卖出自己的“小份花”，主要原因是想留着自己纺织，怕卖了花买不回布，或怕卖了花钱归了家庭，自己的穿衣和日用品成了问题。因此，除对妇女进行思想动员而外，各经济部门应做好妇女所需要的布匹和日用百货、尤其是妇女们心爱的花布、毛巾、袜子等物资的供应工作，应尽可能调运这些物资下乡，直接供应，做到使妇女不出村就能卖棉买物。同时，应保证卖了“小份花”的钱归妇女所有，消除妇女卖花的顾虑。
    （四）动员妇女售棉储棉，要和发动她们参加农业生产联系起来。根据河北武安等地经验，发动妇女以花换布，省下纺织所用的时间来下地生产，一般农民颇为欢迎。因为农事太忙，人手不足是目前棉农一般的困难。治蚜工作更需要许多妇女参加。如果发动妇女下地的工作做得好，许多农民都会鼓励妇女售棉的。
