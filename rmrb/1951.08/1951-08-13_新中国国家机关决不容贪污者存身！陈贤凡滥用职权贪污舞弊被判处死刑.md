New China's State Organs Will Never Tolerate the Existence of Corrupt Individuals!
Chen Xianfan Sentenced to Death for Abuse of Power, Embezzlement, and Malfeasance

[Our Dispatch] Chen Xianfan, Deputy Director of the Planning Department of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, abused his power for embezzlement and malfeasance. After being reported by employees of the East China Textile Administration Bureau and thoroughly investigated by the East China Supervisory Committee, the Shanghai People's Court sentenced the individuals involved in this case on May 18th.

Chen Xianfan was already engaging in embezzlement and self-enrichment while working for the pseudo-China Textile Company. Although he had received more than a year of education after liberation, he did not change his old habits and continued to collude with unscrupulous dye merchants and some backward technicians, abusing his power. Among the fifty or sixty dye merchants in Shanghai, the three companies of Xingchang, Damao, and Jiafeng, which had close relations with Chen, had the most transactions with the East China Textile Administration Bureau. The transaction volume of Xingchang and Damao with the East China Textile Administration Bureau accounted for more than 50% of their total annual sales. In March 1950, Damao bought 15 dan of intermediate meta-benzene diamine at 6 million yuan per dan and sold it to the East China Textile Administration Bureau for 10 million yuan per dan, making a huge profit of 60 million yuan in a single transaction. In July 1949, Chen Xianfan and his confidant Lin Tianyou, using the fast pigment orange produced by their own Zhonghua Dye Factory, impersonated German goods and entrusted Jiafeng manager Chen Weisun to sell 37 kilograms to the First Printing and Dyeing Factory. After the First Printing and Dyeing Factory's tests showed that the color was dull and unsuitable for use, Chen approved it as "suitable" and forced the First Printing and Dyeing Factory to purchase it. Due to the collusion between Chen and unscrupulous dye merchants, the East China Textile Administration Bureau purchased a large number of unusable, substandard dyes. For example, the First Printing and Dyeing Factory purchased more than 5,860 kilograms of unusable Bien Blue Salt before and after liberation (more than 2,076 kilograms before liberation and 3,784 kilograms after liberation), of which those from Damao and Xingchang accounted for 78% of all substandard goods. The Shuiyue brand An'an blue cloth produced by various printing and dyeing factories under the East China Textile Administration Bureau was originally dyed with standard phthalo blue salt, which was known for its non-fading quality. However, from September 1949 to July 1950, the First Printing and Dyeing Factory dyed a total of 130,000 bolts of An'an blue cloth, of which 100,000 bolts were dyed with unusable Bien Blue Salt according to the "operational standards" revised by Chen Xianfan. Four thousand four hundred and forty bolts were sold to the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, and after being made into clothes, the color faded after sixty hours of wear. The First Printing and Dyeing Factory compensated 330 million yuan for re-dyeing fees. Although other retail sales were not returned, the masses suffered great losses. As a result, the reputation of Shuiyue brand An'an blue cloth plummeted. Although the quality has since improved, it has been impossible to restore its reputation for the time being. For example, the market price of student blue cloth, which was originally the same price as Shuiyue brand An'an blue cloth, was 440,000 yuan per bolt, while Shuiyue brand An'an blue cloth was only sold for 314,000 yuan. Based solely on the First Printing and Dyeing Factory's actual total output of 43,038 bolts from September to December 1949, the loss was over 5 billion yuan. In order to engage in embezzlement and malfeasance, Chen and others not only controlled the power to decide the color, pattern, dye variety, and chemical analysis of printing and dyeing, but also utilized backward technicians in various printing and dyeing factories and purchasing institutions of the East China Textile Administration Bureau to participate in their corrupt activities, suppressed upright technicians, ran their own factories outside, colluded with unscrupulous merchants, excluded relatively upright dye merchants, and organized dye chemical societies to create factions. They did everything they could to ingratiate themselves with their superiors, flatter them, and deceive them. Therefore, the broad masses of employees were extremely dissatisfied with them. When the Central Supervisory Committee went to the East China Textile Administration Bureau to inspect work in September last year, employees of the First Printing and Dyeing Factory and the East China Textile Administration Bureau filed accusations and reports one after another. After thorough investigation by the East China Supervisory Committee, Chen Xianfan, Lin Tianyou, and others were handed over to judicial organs for handling. On May 18th of this year, the Shanghai People's Court sentenced Chen Xianfan to death, and Lin Tianyou and others were sentenced to imprisonment. The handling of this case and the East China Textile Administration Bureau's mobilization of employees in various factories to study the Central Supervisory Committee's circular on this case have greatly helped the work of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, and the prestige of the People's Government has been further enhanced. For example, after the news of Chen and others' arrest spread to various factories, the broad masses of employees were extremely excited, and many people reflected: "The East China Textile Administration Bureau's bully has been overthrown," "Unexpectedly, the government handled this problem so quickly!" In particular, after Chen and others were arrested, the employees of the First Printing and Dyeing Factory worked harder and the quality improved rapidly. This shows that some people's idea that Chen and others were technicians and feared that the handling would affect production is wrong. On the contrary, the policy of resolutely striking at the ringleaders, striving for the coerced, and handling them carefully will not only not antagonize the technicians, but also unite, educate, and transform the technicians even better, and will not only not affect production, but will also inspire the masses to improve production after dealing with the corrupt elements hated by the masses. The Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council attached great importance to this case and specially circulated the handling of this case to various public enterprises, hoping that various public enterprises will also seriously examine and deal with similar phenomena in their own units.

　　新中国国家机关决不容贪污者存身！
    陈贤凡滥用职权贪污舞弊被判处死刑
    【本报讯】华东纺织管理局计划处副处长陈贤凡，利用职权贪污舞弊，经华东纺织管理局职工检举和华东监察委员会彻查，五月十八日，上海市人民法院已将此案有关者分别判决。
    陈贤凡在伪中纺公司供职时即贪污自肥，解放后虽已受年余教育，但仍不改旧习，利用职权继续与颜料奸商及部分落后技术人员勾结舞弊。上海有颜料商五、六十家，与陈有密切关系的兴昌、大贸、嘉丰等三家与华东纺织管理局交易为最多。兴昌、大贸与华东纺织管理局的交易额占全年销货总额百分之五十以上，一九五○年三月份大贸以每担六百万元买进之媒介性元十五担卖给华东纺织管理局，每担作价一千万元，转手之间即获暴利六千万元。一九四九年七月，陈贤凡与其亲信林天佑以自己开办之中化染料厂出品快色素橘黄冒充德货，托嘉丰经理陈渭荪售与第一印染厂三十七公斤，经第一印染厂化验认为色泽暗淡不合应用，陈则批示“合用”，迫令第一印染厂收购。由于陈等勾结颜料奸商，使华东纺织管理局买进大批不能用的劣质染料，例如第一印染厂解放前后买进不能用之比恩蓝盐约五千八百六十余公斤（解放前两千零七十六余公斤，解放后计三千七百八十四余公斤），其中来自大贸与兴昌两家的即占全部劣货百分之七十八。华东纺织管理局各印染厂出品之水月牌安安蓝布，向用标准颜料凡拉明蓝盐染制，永不退色信誉卓著。但一九四九年九月至一九五○年七月，第一印染厂共染安安蓝十三万匹，内有十万匹系依陈贤凡改定之“经营标准”即用不能用的比恩蓝盐染制，卖给郑州铁路局四千四百四十匹，制成衣服后穿六十小时，色即褪落，由第一印染厂赔偿再染费三亿三千万元，其他零星批售者虽未退回，但群众所受损失很大，因此水月牌安安蓝布之信誉一落千丈，此后质量虽提高，但一时无法挽回信誉。例如原与水月牌安安蓝布价相同之学生蓝布每匹市价四十四万元，而水月牌安安蓝布仅卖三十一万四千元。单就第一印染厂一九四九年九月至十二月，实际总产量四万三千零三十八匹计，损失即达五十亿以上。陈等为了贪污舞弊，不仅掌握了决定印染色泽、花样、颜料品种及化验分析之大权，而且在各印染厂及华东纺织管理局购料机构中到处利用落后技术人员参加其无弊行为，打击正派技术人员，在外则自营工厂，勾结奸商，排斥比较正派之颜料商，并组织染化学会专门制造派系，对上极尽奉迎拍马蒙蔽欺骗之能事，因此广大职工对之极为不满，去年九月中央监察委员会赴华东纺织管理局检查工作时，第一印染厂及华东纺织管理局职工纷纷控告检举，经华东监察委员会彻查，将陈贤凡、林天佑等送司法机关法办。今年五月十八日，上海市人民法院判处陈贤凡死刑，林天佑等分别判处徒刑。此案之处理及华东纺织管理局发动各厂职工学习中央监察委员会关于此案的通报以后，对华东纺织管理局工作帮助很大，人民政府威信亦进一步提高。例如陈等被捕消息传到各厂后，广大职工极为兴奋，不少人反映：“华东纺织管理局恶霸被打倒了，”“想不到政府处理这个问题这样快！”特别是第一印染厂职工于陈等被捕后工作更为努力，质量迅速提高。由此说明有些人认为陈等系技术人员，害怕处理后影响生产之想法是不对的，相反的坚决打击首要争取胁从慎重处理的方针，不但不会与技术人员对立，而且更能团结与教育改造技术人员，不但不会影响生产，而且处理为群众痛恶的贪污分子后，更能激奋群众提高生产。政务院财政经济委员会对于此案极为重视，特将此案处理经过通报各公营企业，希各公营企业亦认真检查处理本单位的此类现象。
