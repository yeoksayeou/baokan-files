Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: According to a report from Kaesong by "Workers' Daily" reporter Wilfred Burchett: General Nam Il solemnly pointed out at the meeting on the 12th that the stalemate in the armistice negotiations should be the responsibility of the Americans, and asked them to stop deceiving the world. He urged the US side to abandon its absurd demand to draw the entire demilitarized zone north of the current battle line. He spread out the map illustrating the American demands on the table, showing that the United States was demanding that the Koreans and Chinese cede an area of more than 12,000 square kilometers currently in their hands. He demanded that the US side publish their proposal to the world, because they have always used ambiguous terms such as "marked by the battle line" and "military line close to the battle line" to disguise their proposal. The Koreans and Chinese are fully willing to discuss all issues, but what the US side is asking for is not discussion, but acceptance of their proposal. What General Nam Il was actually asking for was for Joye to bring a map to the meeting to explain what they mean by the dividing line and the demilitarized zone, and what is the relationship with the current battle line and the 38th parallel; in addition, they should produce a map that they dare to make public to the world without feeling ashamed, because they know that the public will not approve of demanding that Korea cede a large piece of land to the United States in the name of the United Nations. This is a demand for honesty and sincerity, and to stop creating so many rumors of various kinds in Washington, Tokyo, and Kaesong. In fact, the only certain thing is that the US side is lying. This straightforward exposure of the US's deception may help the British people understand what the United States is demanding in their name that they never knew, and understand why the United States is still deliberately creating a stalemate every day, causing more people (including British people) to lose their lives. This is Washington's deliberate conspiracy to keep the negotiations deadlocked. They want to keep the tense situation going so that their "foreign aid," rearmament of Japan, and armament of their own military plans can be passed. They stubbornly cling to their hopeless goals, thinking that they can get what they covet but have not yet obtained by blackmailing at the meeting.

    美方应负开城会议僵局全责
    【新华社十四日讯】据英国伦敦工人日报记者魏宁顿自开城报道：南日将军在十二日的会议上严正地指出：停战谈判陷于僵局应由美国人负责，并要他们不要再欺骗全世界。他敦促美方放弃他们的要把整个非军事区都划在目前战线以北的荒唐要求。他把说明美国要求的地图在桌子上摊开，表明美国是要求朝鲜人、中国人把现在在他们手上的土地让出一万二千方公里以上的地区。他要求美方向全世界公布他们的建议。因为他们始终是用一些模棱两可的词句如“以战线为标志”和“与战线相近的军事线”来把他们的建议掩饰起来。朝鲜人、中国人完全愿意讨论一切问题，但美方要求的不是讨论而是要接受他们的建议。南日将军所要求的其实只是要乔埃带一幅地图来开会，说明他们所谓分界线、非军事区是什么意思，和目前的战线及三八线有什么关系；此外，要他们拿出一幅他们敢于公之于全世界而不觉得羞耻的地图来。因为他们知道公众是不会赞成假借联合国之名要求朝鲜把一大块土地割让给美国的。这是要求老老实实和拿出诚意来，不要在华盛顿、东京、开城制造这样多的各种各色的谣言，其实唯一确实的事情就是美方是在撒谎。这个直截了当揭穿美方的欺骗的作法，可能帮助英国人民了解他们从来不知道的美国在假借他们的名义要求些什么东西，了解美国为什么每天仍在故意造成僵局，使更多人（其中有英国人）丧失生命。这是华盛顿的处心积虑的阴谋，想使谈判僵持不下。他们想让紧张的局势继续下去，以便使他们的“援外”、重新武装日本和武装自己的军备计划得到通过。他们死抱着他们的无望的目的不放，以为在会议上进行敲诈就可以得到他们所觊觎而不曾得到的东西。
