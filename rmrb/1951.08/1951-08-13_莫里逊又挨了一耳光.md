　　Morrison Gets Another Slap in the Face

　　British Foreign Secretary Morrison, in an article published in Pravda, described the "free" life of the British people, saying: "If someone knocks on the door in the morning, there is no need to be afraid that the knocker is a policeman. This person is most likely the milkman or a postman." However, the Irish newspaper *The Irish News*, in an editorial, pointed out that this kind of fear is not only common in the lives of hundreds of thousands of Irish people in these six counties (referring to the six counties of British-controlled Northern Ireland), but in recent weeks, such a knock is followed by the police unreasonably arresting people who have not violated any laws and do not need to be prosecuted.

　　Lies cannot cover up the facts. Morrison has received another sharp slap in the face!

　　莫里逊又挨了一耳光
    英国外相莫里逊在真理报上发表的文章中，曾描写英国人民的“自由”生活，他说：“倘若早晨有人叩门，不必害怕叩门者是一个警察。这个人多半是送牛奶的人或者是一个邮差。”但是爱尔兰的《爱尔兰新闻》却在社论中指出：这种害怕的情绪不但是这六个郡内（按指属于英国的北爱尔兰六个郡）数十万爱尔兰人生活中所常见的，而且最近几星期以来，这样一种的叩门跟着就是警察无理地逮捕没有任何违法行为也不需要被起诉的人。
    谎言是掩盖不了事实的，莫里逊又挨了一记清脆的耳光！
