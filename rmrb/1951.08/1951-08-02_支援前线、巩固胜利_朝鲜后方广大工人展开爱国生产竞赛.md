Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 31st. The broad masses of workers in the Korean rear are unremittingly launching patriotic wartime production emulation drives to support the frontlines and consolidate victory. After overfulfilling the plan for the key restoration of wartime production in the first half of this year, the workers have launched a struggle to complete the annual production plan ahead of schedule.

More than half a year ago, when the broad regions of northern Korea had just been liberated from the enemy, and workers returned to their factories from the mountains and guerrilla units, all they saw were ruins. All the large and small factories and enterprises had been burned or bombed by the enemy. The heroic and tenacious Korean workers were not discouraged. Under the leadership of the Labor Party and the Vocational Alliance (trade union), they concentrated manpower and materials and carried out key restoration and renovation work. The workers transported machines destroyed by the enemy to safe areas, dug up important machines and parts they had buried before the retreat from underground, and rebuilt factory buildings with broken bricks and wood from the ruins. In just half a year, not only did the rumble of machines sound again in the factories and mines producing the materials most needed on the production front, but also the workshops and mills producing daily necessities for the people in the rear were restored in large numbers.

Under extremely difficult conditions of labor, equipment, and raw material shortages, the workers brought their creativity into play and overcame numerous difficulties, achieving great successes. A certain lead mine in South Hamgyong Province was completely burned down by the enemy; however, thanks to the selfless labor of the miners, production was restored in just one and a half months, and they consecutively won the Victory Flag awarded by the Korean Cabinet in May and June. At the end of June, the mine had already completed 848.4 percent of its production task. The smelting furnace of a certain machinery factory could not resume production due to a lack of coke. Worker Quan Binghe invented a reverberatory furnace, using anthracite instead of coke, which not only enabled production to resume, but also saved the state a large amount of funds every month. Zhao Doushi, a rock driller in a certain mine, created a new method of drilling holes and a method of blasting, increasing the daily output from eight tons to one hundred and seventy tons, while saving one-third of the explosives. Jin Fengnv, a female worker in a certain clothing factory, created a detailed division of labor method, increasing productivity by 50 percent, and therefore completed the production plan for the first half of the year forty days ahead of schedule.

Thanks to the efforts of the great Korean working class, in the past six months, in the Korean military supplies, machinery, railway, forestry, and other production departments, not only did all units overfulfill their production tasks, but some departments have also completed their annual production tasks.

In order to adapt to the expansion of the restoration work, a large number of female technicians are learning to take on major labor roles in thousands of technical training classes. They will become a strong new force on the labor front. With the assistance of the people in various places, the workers in various factories and mines voluntarily work an extra two or three hours every day, collecting waste materials and machine parts, conducting surveys and registrations, and preparing for further restoration work.

The armistice negotiations have not affected the Korean workers' efforts to step up production and support the front. The female workers of a certain clothing factory in Pyongyang decided to complete the production of this year's winter clothing before the "August 15th" Liberation Memorial Day. Railway workers decided to designate August as "Operational Safety Month" to ensure the accident-free doubling of the travel plan. The workers said: We must not relax our vigilance against the cunning and insidious American aggressors. Only by strengthening our own strength can victory be consolidated and peace guaranteed.

### 支援前线、巩固胜利  朝鲜后方广大工人展开爱国生产竞赛

　　支援前线、巩固胜利
    朝鲜后方广大工人展开爱国生产竞赛
    【新华社平壤三十一日电】朝鲜后方广大工人为支援前线，巩固胜利，正不懈地进行爱国主义战时生产竞赛。工人们在超额完成今年上半年重点地恢复战时生产的计划后，又展开了争取提前完成全年生产计划的斗争。
    半年多以前，当朝鲜北半部广大地区刚从敌人手里解放出来，工人们从山里和游击队里重新回到自己的工厂的时候，他们所看到的只是一片废墟，所有的大小工厂、企业都已经被敌人焚毁或炸毁了。英勇顽强的朝鲜工人没有气馁。他们在劳动党和职业同盟（工会）的领导下，集中人力、物力，进行了有重点的恢复修整工作。工人们把被敌人破坏了的机器搬运到安全地带，从地下挖出他们在撤退前埋藏起来的重要机器、零件，用废墟上的碎砖、木料重新盖起厂房。仅仅半年的时间，不但生产前线最需要的物资的厂矿又响起了轧轧的机器声音；而且，生产后方人民日常必需品的工场、作坊也大批地恢复起来了。
    工人们在极端缺乏劳动力、器材和原料的困难条件下，发挥创造性，克服了重重困难，有了很大的成就。咸镜南道某铅矿场被敌人全部烧毁；但是，在矿工们的忘我劳动下，仅仅一个半月的时间，就恢复了生产，因而在五、六两月连续获得朝鲜内阁所颁发的优胜旗。六月底，该矿已经完成了生产任务的百分之八百四十八点四。某机械工厂的熔解炉因为没有焦炭而无法恢复生产。工人权炳鹤发明了反射炉，用无烟煤代替焦炭，不但使生产得以恢复，而且每月替国家节约了大量资金。某矿山凿岩工赵斗实创造了新的凿眼方法和爆炸方法，把每天的生产量从八吨提高到一百七十吨，同时节省炸药三分之一。某被服厂女工金凤女创造细致的分工法，提高生产率百分之五十，因此，提前四十天完成了上半年的生产计划。
    在伟大的朝鲜工人阶级的努力下，半年来，在朝鲜军需、机械、铁路、林业等生产部门，不但所有单位都超额完成了生产任务；而且，有若干部门已完成了全年生产任务。
    为了适应恢复工作的扩展，大批妇女技工正在数以千计的技术传习班中学习担任主要劳动。她们将成为劳动战线上一支坚强的生力军。各厂、矿的工人们在各地人民的协助下，每天自动额外劳动二、三小时，搜集废料和机器零件，进行调查登记，为进一步的恢复工作作好准备。
    停战谈判丝毫没有影响朝鲜工人加紧生产、支援前线的努力。平壤某被服工厂的女工决定在“八、一五”解放纪念日以前，全部完成今年冬装生产的任务。铁路工人决定把八月份定为“运转安全月”，保证无事故地加倍完成行走计划。工人们说：对于狡猾阴险的美国侵略者，我们决不能丝毫放松警惕性。只有加强我们自己的力量，胜利才能巩固，和平才有保障。
