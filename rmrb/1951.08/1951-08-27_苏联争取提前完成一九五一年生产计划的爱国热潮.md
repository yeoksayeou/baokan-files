　　Soviet Patriotic Upsurge to Strive for Early Completion of the 1951 Production Plan

Since the end of March this year, letters from Soviet working people to Stalin have been flooding into the Kremlin like snowflakes. These letters express a common will: to complete the 1951 production plan ahead of schedule!

Writing to the respected Stalin is the most solemn action of the Soviet working people. They have never failed to victoriously complete anything they promise to do before Stalin. Therefore, reporting the production plan in a letter to Stalin is a sign of the high tide of the patriotic production upsurge of the Soviet working people. The working people of Moscow's industry and transportation wrote in their letter to Stalin: "We clearly know that the victorious completion of the task is a new contribution to further consolidating the strength of our Soviet state and a new contribution to consolidating world peace." It is on the basis of this high degree of political consciousness that the working people of the entire Soviet Union, led by Moscow, have been completing their production plans ahead of schedule month by month and quarter by quarter.

The goal of completing this year's production plan ahead of schedule is to be achieved through a socialist emulation movement with very rich content. Soviet working people have initiated and promoted many significant emulation movements in the post-war period. The most important of these are the collective Stakhanovite labor movement, the production of high-quality products movement, the comprehensive saving of materials and raw materials movement, the scientific summarization and promotion of the experience of Stakhanovite workers movement, and the strive for better use of technical equipment movement. These movements are still deepening now, deepening in combination with each other.

Taking the movement to produce high-quality products as an example. The number of "High-Quality Product Production Groups," "High-Quality Product Workshops," and "High-Quality Product Factories" is increasing day by day. In Moscow, the "Red Flag" Factory, the "Dimitrov" Sanitary Clothing Factory, the "Hammer and Sickle" Factory, the "Shock Worker" Factory, the "Red October" Factory, and the Khrushchev Bread Factory, among others, have now been awarded the glorious title of "High-Quality Product Factory." Since March of this year, the high-quality product movement has had two major developments: one is the movement to produce the cheapest high-quality products initiated by Rybak, the foreman of the "Lathe" factory in Moscow; the other is the movement to extend the life of automobiles initiated by the Ural Stalin Automobile Factory.

It seems impossible to have both high quality and low price, but Rybak did it. Alexander Rybak is a new generation of workers born after the October Revolution. He has the common characteristics of Soviet young workers: he values the collective and deeply understands the connection between labor and national interests. He became the foreman of the thread-making (tool for making screws) department of the "Lathe" factory two years ago. Under his leadership, this department has won the title of "Collective Stakhanovite Labor Department" for a year. The thread-making tools they produce are much cheaper than those produced by other factories in the country. But they were not complacent. In March, they carefully studied the production situation in the department, and after precise calculations, decided to increase output by 25 percent with the existing equipment, reduce production costs by 12 percent compared to last year, and reduce waste loss by 50 percent. Rybak and his partners had a clear political understanding when they set these production goals. They wrote in the competition conditions: "Continuously reducing production costs is of the utmost importance in the struggle to build a communist society." They adopted methods such as a dedicated person responsibility system, promoting advanced experience, improving specifications, renovating waste products, using waste materials, and saving materials. Rybak regarded economic accounting as an important link in solving the task, which first required workers to have a clear understanding of the value of labor and the value of materials. Rybak obtained the assistance of the factory's technical advisory office and explained the cost situation to the workers, explaining that every one percent of waste products was equal to several thousand rubles. Due to the reduction in production costs, Rybak's department saved the state more than 85,000 rubles in the second quarter of this year. Rybak's movement has spread to many factories in the machine tool and tool manufacturing industries.

The significance of the movement to extend the life of automobiles initiated by the Ural Stalin Automobile Factory is very significant. This factory has twice won the Soviet Council of Ministers' winning red flag and twice won the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions and the Ministry of Industry's winning red flag in the competition among enterprises of the Ministry of Automotive and Tractor Industry last year. This factory began a collective Stakhanovite labor competition at the beginning of this year, and now there are 19 Stakhanovite workshops, 180 Stakhanovite departments, and about three-quarters of the workers in the factory have become Stakhanovite workers. Inspired by the summary of the Five-Year Plan after the war and the communist construction project, the workers of this factory recently decided to give full play to the factory's potential, improve production technology, and improve the quality of the trucks produced, extending their driving insurance period from the current 25,000 kilometers to 35,000 kilometers by the end of this year and even 50,000 kilometers next year. Doubling the life of a car is practically equivalent to building twice as many factories! The pioneering work of the Ural Stalin Automobile Factory has been responded to by the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, the Gorky City Molotov Automobile Factory, the Minsk Automobile Factory, the Chelyabinsk Ordzhonikidze Agricultural Machinery Factory, and other enterprises.

The competition for collective Stakhanovite labor is expanding. Many enterprises, from production groups, workshops to the entire factory, are striving to become Stakhanovite workers collectively. In Moscow alone, the First and Second Ball Bearing Factories, the Carburetor Factory, the Small Automobile Factory, the Dorogomilovo Chemical Factory, the Calculating and Analytical Machine Factory, and the Kontsevo Platinum Needle Factory have been awarded the glorious title of "Collective Stakhanovite Enterprise". In the machine tool and tool industry, there are more than 380 "Stakhanovite departments", 261 "Stakhanovite workshops" and two "Stakhanovite factories" in the entire Soviet Union. In the automotive and tractor industry, there are 2,185 "Stakhanovite departments," 346 "Stakhanovite workshops," and eleven "Stakhanovite factories." There are five Stakhanovite factories in the chemical industry.

Saving is a reliable way to increase the country's capital accumulation. The saving competition has always been a mass movement in Soviet enterprises. Moscow industry saved 150 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first five months of this year. The Moscow textile industry saved 760 tons of cotton, 964 tons of cotton yarn, and 100 tons of silk in the first five months of this year. Reducing production costs is the best way to save. The Moscow "Petrel" shoe factory, which won the Order of Lenin in the first half of this year, produced 200,000 pairs of shoes more than planned, of which more than 100,000 pairs were made of saved leather; the factory obtained an extra profit of 2.7 million rubles, of which 1.98 million rubles were due to the reduction in production costs. On the basis of these achievements, female worker Levptinka, with full patriotic enthusiasm, raised the competition to a higher level. She gave a speech at the production meeting on August 3, using precise calculations to convince the workers of the possibility of further reducing costs. First, saving materials: her production group saved 25,862 square decimeters of leather in June, which can make 1,100 pairs of shoes. Second, improving labor productivity: if her workshop increases labor productivity by 1 percent, it can cut 215 more pairs of shoes a day. In addition, she also pointed out the significance of improving product quality and machine efficiency and reducing electricity consumption for reducing costs. Later, she proposed at the meeting to launch a competition of "reducing costs for every operation." She announced that she would seek improvements in reducing costs and save 34,000 rubles per year on one operation. Her initiative was immediately supported by young worker Mukhanov and passed at the factory's production meeting. Mukhanov promised to save 9,500 rubles a year by saving auxiliary materials, extending machine working hours, using tools better, and increasing productivity.

The movement to better use technical equipment is playing a major role not only in industry but also in mechanized agricultural harvesting. Now the Soviet Union is enthusiastically harvesting from south to north, and good harvests are being reported everywhere. Many farms in the North Caucasus and Crimea harvest 3,500 kg to 4,000 kg (7,000 to 8,000 jin) of barley per hectare (one hectare equals fifteen mu). Many farms in Kuban and Ukraine harvest 3,000 kg to more than 3,000 kg of wheat per hectare. Harvesting is seasonal, so untimely harvesting will cause crop losses. However, due to the use of combine harvesters, harvesting can be completed quickly and on time. As of the end of July, machine tractor stations harvested 8.5 million hectares more land with combine harvesters than last year. Many combine harvester operators completed their harvesting plans ahead of schedule in the competition, exceeding the quota by one or two times. This year, advanced agricultural workers in the Soviet Union widely used the flowing water harvesting method. This method requires harvesting wheat, transporting wheat, threshing wheat, cleaning wheat, drying wheat, entering the warehouse, stacking wheat straw, and other tasks to be closely linked without decoupling. This is a new creation for organizing labor and using machines. Due to the efforts of agricultural workers, the main grain producing areas of the Soviet Union – Kuban, Stavropol, Crimea, Nikolaev Oblast, Dnepropetrovsk Oblast, Ismail Oblast, Grozny Oblast, and Kherson Oblast – have all delivered millions of poods (one pood equals 32.76 jin) more grain to the state than last year ahead of schedule. Kherson Oblast alone delivered 18,562,000 poods more grain than last year.

The huge development of socialist emulation has aroused the doubled concern of the Soviet Communist Party and trade unions for the leadership of the emulation. In the past two months, the publications of the Party and trade unions have paid special attention to summarizing the experience and lessons in this regard. The Fourth Plenary Session of the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions held in late July will have a major impact on the Soviet working people's efforts to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule and on future socialist emulation. The plenary session discussed in detail the issue of improving the trade union's leadership of socialist emulation. Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions, made an important report at the meeting. Kuznetsov pointed out that the main shortcoming of leading socialist emulation is that trade union organizations and economic organizations cannot always estimate the development and changes of technical equipment and the emulation movement in recent years. The original national competition conditions are no longer applicable, and new competition conditions should be formulated and approved. These conditions include the following specific tasks: abiding by the specified product table, improving the quality of products and varieties, saving materials and raw materials, increasing labor productivity and reducing product costs. Kuznetsov criticized the incorrect view of promoting the new initiatives of production innovators as chasing fashion. He pointed out that it is wrong to pay attention to the high-quality product movement at the beginning, then only pay attention to the comprehensive saving competition, and then only pay attention to the method of Guo Valev to promote advanced production experience. He said: "Every new initiative in the competition enriches the content of the competition and raises the competition to a higher level. Trade union organizations and economic organizations must lead the competition in such a way that every new initiative of advanced people is organically added to the conditions of socialist competition and that it is widely and truly massively popularized."

Kuznetsov also said that Soviet trade union organizations and economic organizations have done a lot of things to promote the experience of advanced producers. Now it is difficult to find an enterprise that does not have a Stakhanov School and has not made reports and lectures on advanced labor methods. However, there are also shortcomings in this regard. Economic organizations and trade union organizations should promote advanced production experience widely and on a large scale. Therefore, it is necessary to activate the activities of production meetings, and it is necessary to use more widely the forms that help exchange experience: Stakhanov Tuesdays, production demonstrations, public performances, exhibitions, advanced experience popularization conferences. It is necessary to consolidate and expand the creative cooperation between production workers and scientific workers as much as possible, and it is necessary to constantly care about the further development of inventions and rationalization proposals by a large number of workers.

Kuznetsov believes that every advanced enterprise in the Soviet Union should have the following basic conditions: winning the national socialist competition for at least four consecutive seasons; fundamentally improving the technical process; producing high-quality products; abiding by strict saving in the consumption of raw materials, fuel and materials; laborers have a high degree of production education; labor conditions and safety equipment are exemplary; all workers complete production quotas; systematically improving the living conditions and cultural equipment of employees.

Kuznetsov emphasized the importance of summarizing the competition in his report. He said: Summarizing the competition is by no means purely technical work, but a thoughtful analysis of the achievements of collective work, widely informing all employees of these achievements, narrating the outstanding deeds of advanced producers, discovering the reasons for the backwardness of individual departments and workers, and mobilizing the collective to fight for further improvement of production. The publication and comparison of achievements, the possibility of practically promoting advanced experience, this is what must first be guaranteed when summarizing the competition.

The further improvement of the Soviet working people's production enthusiasm, the improvement of competition leadership, and the improvement of competition conditions will ensure that the Soviet working people achieve great results in the competition to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule.

　　苏联争取提前完成一九五一年生产计划的爱国热潮
    新华社驻莫斯科记者  李何
    今年三月底以来，苏联劳动人民写给斯大林的信，象雪片一般飞到克里姆林宫。这些信表露出一个共同的意志：要提前完成一九五一年生产计划！
    上书给敬爱的斯大林，这是苏联劳动人民最郑重的行动。凡是在斯大林面前答应要做到的事情，他们从来没有不胜利完成的。因此，上书给斯大林报告生产计划，正是苏联劳动人民爱国生产热潮高涨的标志。莫斯科工业和运输业劳动人民给斯大林的信中说：“我们清楚地知道，胜利地完成任务，是进一步巩固我们苏维埃国力的新贡献，巩固世界和平的新贡献。”正是在这种高度政治觉悟的基础上，以莫斯科为首的全苏联劳动人民逐月逐季地提前完成着生产计划。
    提前完成今年生产计划的目标，是通过内容非常丰富的社会主义竞赛运动去争取的。苏联劳动人民在战后曾经发起和推广了许多意义重大的竞赛运动。其中最主要的是集体斯塔哈诺夫式劳动运动，出产优等质量产品运动，全面节约材料和原料运动，科学地总结和推广斯塔哈诺夫式工作者经验运动，争取更好地使用技术装备运动。这些运动现在还在深入着，互相结合地深入着。
      ×      ×      ×
    拿出产优等质量产品运动来说。“优等质量产品生产组”、“优等质量产品车间”、“优等质量产品工厂”的数目一天天增多。在莫斯科，现在获得“优等质量产品工厂”光荣称号的有“红旗”工厂、“季米特洛夫”卫生衣工厂、“锤子与镰刀”工厂、“突击队员”工厂、“红十月”工厂、赫鲁舍切夫面包厂等。今年三月以来，优等质量产品运动有两项重大的发展：一项是莫斯科“镟床”工厂领班雷巴克发起的出产最便宜的优等产品运动；另一项是乌拉尔斯大林汽车工厂发起的延长汽车寿命运动。
    既要物美又要价廉，似乎是不可能的，但是雷巴克却做到了。亚历山大·雷巴克是十月革命以后出生的新一代的工人。他有苏联青年工人的共同特点：重视集体，深知劳动和国家利益的联系。他两年前当了“镟床”工厂丝板（制造螺丝钉的工具）分部的领班。在他的领导下，这一分部工人荣获“集体斯塔哈诺夫式劳动分部”的称号已经一年。他们出产的丝板，比全国其他工厂都便宜很多。但是他们没有自满。三月间，他们非常仔细地研究了分部的生产情况，经过精密的计算之后，决定用原有的装备提高产量百分之二十五，使生产成本比去年减低百分之十二，同时减少废品的损失百分之五十。雷巴克和他的伙伴们规定这些生产目标时，是有明确的政治认识的。他们在竞赛条件中写道：“不断地减低生产成本，在建设共产主义社会的斗争中有着最重要的意义。”他们采用了专人负责制、推广先进经验、提高规格、改造废品、利用废料、节省材料等等办法。雷巴克把经济核算看作解决任务的重要环节，这就首先要求工人们对劳动价值和材料价值有明确的认识。雷巴克取得了工厂技术顾问处的帮助，向工人解释了成本情况，说明了每百分之一的废品等于几千卢布。由于减低生产成本，雷巴克分部在今年第二季就为国家节省了八万五千多卢布。雷巴克的运动已经普及到母机和工具制造业的许多工厂去。
    乌拉尔斯大林汽车工厂所发起的延长汽车寿命运动的意义是非常重大的。这个工厂去年曾在汽车和拖拉机工业部各企业的竞赛中两次得到苏联部长会议的优胜红旗，两次得到全苏工会中央理事会和工业部的优胜红旗。这个工厂今年初开始了集体斯塔哈诺夫式劳动竞赛，现在已有十九个斯塔哈诺夫式车间，一百八十个斯塔哈诺夫式分部，全厂约有四分之三的工人已成为斯塔哈诺夫式工作者。这个工厂的工人们受了战后五年计划总结和共产主义建设工程的鼓舞，不久前决定发挥工厂潜在能力，改进生产技术，提高所出产的载重汽车的质量，延长它的行驶保险期限，由现在的二万五千公里提高到今年底的三万五千公里以至明年的五万公里。延长汽车寿命一倍，其实际意义就等于增建一倍的工厂！乌拉尔斯大林汽车工厂的创举，已得到莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂、高尔基城莫洛托夫汽车工厂、明斯克汽车工厂、车里雅宾斯克奥尔忠尼启则农业机器工厂及其他企业的响应。

    集体斯塔哈诺夫式劳动的竞赛日益扩大着。许多企业从生产组、车间到全厂，都在争取集体成为斯塔哈诺夫工作者。仅在莫斯科，整个工厂获得“集体斯塔哈诺夫式企业”光荣称号的已经有：第一和第二球轴承工厂、炭化器工厂、小型汽车工厂、“多洛哥米洛沃”化学工厂、计算分析机工厂、“孔采沃”白金针工厂。在母机和工具工业中，全苏联共有三百八十多个“斯塔哈诺夫式分部”、二百六十一个“斯塔哈诺夫式车间”、两个“斯塔哈诺夫式工厂”。在汽车和拖拉机工业中，有二千一百八十五个“斯塔哈诺夫式分部”、三百四十六个“斯塔哈诺夫式车间”、十一个“斯塔哈诺夫式工厂”。在化学工业中有五个斯塔哈诺夫式工厂。
      ×      ×      ×
    节约是增加国家的资本积累的可靠方法。节约竞赛一直是苏联企业中的群众性的运动。莫斯科工业在今年头五个月中节约了一亿五千万千瓦时电力。莫斯科纺织工业在今年头五个月中节约了七百六十吨棉花、九百六十四吨棉纱、一百吨丝。减低生产成本是最好的节约办法。今年上半年荣获列宁勋章的莫斯科“海燕”皮鞋厂曾超计划生产了二十万双皮鞋，其中十万双以上是用节约的皮革制造的；该厂获得了二百七十万卢布超额利润，其中一百九十八万卢布是由于减低生产成本得来的。在这些成就的基础上，女工列甫秦卡抱着满腔的爱国热情，把竞赛又提高一步。她在八月三日的生产会议上发表演说，以精密的计算使工人们相信进一步减低成本的可能性。首先是节约材料：她的生产组在六月份就积蓄了二万五千八百六十二平方公寸的皮革，可以制一千一百双鞋。其次是提高劳动生产率：她那一车间如果提高劳动生产率百分之一，一天可以多裁二百十五双鞋。此外，她还指出提高产品质量和机器工作效率以及减少电力消耗对于减低成本的意义。后来，她在会上提议发起“每一个操作都要减低成本”的竞赛。她宣布要在减低成本上求得改进，每年要在一个操作上节约三万四千卢布。她的创议当场得到青年工人穆哈诺夫的支持，在全厂生产会议上通过。穆哈诺夫保证以节约辅助材料、延长机器工作期限、更好地使用工具和提高生产率来争取一年节约九千五百卢布。

    更好地使用技术装备运动，不仅在工业中而且也在机械化的农业收割中起着重大的作用。现在苏联全国从南向北正在热烈进行收割，到处报告丰收。北高加索和克里米亚许多农场，每公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）土地收大麦三千五百公斤到四千公斤（合七千到八千市斤）。库班和乌克兰许多农场，每公顷土地收小麦三千公斤到三千多公斤。收割是有季节性的，因此收割失时就会使作物遭受损失。但是由于使用联合收割机，收割可以按时迅速完成。截至七月底，机器拖拉机站用联合收割机收割的田地，比去年多八百五十万公顷。许多联合收割机手在竞赛中提前完成了收割计划，超过定额一两倍。今年苏联农业先进劳动者广泛地运用川流水式收割法。这一方法要求割麦、运麦、打麦、净麦、晒麦、入仓、堆麦秸等等工作不脱节地紧紧地衔接起来。这是对于组织劳动和使用机器的新的创造。由于农业劳动者的努力，苏联主要产粮区——库班、斯塔夫罗波尔、克里米亚、尼古拉耶夫州、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州、伊斯迈尔州、格罗兹尼州和黑尔逊州，都先后提前向国家交纳了比去年多几百万普特（每普特合三二·七六市斤）粮食。仅黑尔逊一州就比去年多交了一千八百五十六万二千普特粮食。

    社会主义竞赛的巨大发展，引起了苏联共产党和工会对竞赛领导的加倍关心。党和工会的刊物最近两个月来特别注意这方面的经验教训的总结。对于苏联劳动人民争取提前完成今年生产计划和对今后的社会主义竞赛将发生重大影响的，是七月下旬举行的全苏工会中央理事会第四次全体会议。全会详细讨论了改进工会对于社会主义竞赛的领导问题。全苏工会中央理事会主席库兹涅佐夫在会上作了重要的报告。库兹涅佐夫指出：领导社会主义竞赛的主要缺点，在于工会组织和经济组织不能经常估计到近几年来技术装备和竞赛运动的发展和变化。原有的全国竞赛条件已不适用，应拟定和批准新的竞赛条件。这些条件包括下列具体的任务：遵守规定的产品表，改进产品和品类的质量，节约材料和原料，提高劳动生产率和减低产品成本等。库兹涅佐夫批评了把推行生产革新者的新创议当作追逐时髦的不正确观点。他指出：那种开始时注意优等质量产品运动，后来光注意全面节约竞赛，后来又光注意郭瓦廖夫推进先进生产经验的方法，是不对的。他说：“竞赛中的每一个新创议丰富了竞赛的内容，把竞赛提到更高的水平。工会组织和经济组织必须这样来领导竞赛，就是使先进者的每一个新创议都有机地添加到社会主义竞赛的条件中去，并使它广泛的真正大规模的普及起来。”
    库兹涅佐夫又说：苏联工会组织和经济组织对于推广先进生产者的经验，做了不少事情。现在很难找出一个企业没有斯塔哈诺夫学校，没有作过关于先进劳动方法的报告和讲演。然而这方面也有缺点。经济组织和工会组织应当广泛和大规模地推行先进的生产经验。因此，必须使生产会议的活动积极起来，必须更广泛地运用那些有助于交换经验的形式：斯塔哈诺夫星期二、生产观摩、当众表演、展览、先进经验普及会议。必须尽量巩固和扩大生产工作者和科学工作者之间的创造性合作，必须经常关心进一步发展大批工人的发明和合理化建议。
    库兹涅佐夫认为：苏联每个先进的企业应当具备如下基本条件：在全国社会主义竞赛中至少连续四季获得优胜；根本改良了技术过程；生产高度质量的产品；在消费原料、燃料和材料上遵守严格的节约；劳动者有高度的生产教养；劳动条件和安全设备堪为模范；全体工人完成生产定额；有系统地改善职工的居住条件和文化设备。
    库兹涅佐夫在报告中强调指出了总结竞赛的重要性。他说：总结竞赛绝不是纯技术工作，而是深思熟虑地分析集体工作的成绩，向全体职工广泛地通告这些成绩，叙述生产先进者的卓越事迹，发现个别部门、工人落伍的原因，并动员集体为进一步提高生产而斗争。成绩的公布和比较，实际推广先进经验的可能性，这就是总结竞赛时首先要保证的。
    苏联劳动人民生产积极性的进一步提高、竞赛领导的改进、竞赛条件的提高，将保证苏联劳动人民在提前完成今年计划的竞赛中获得巨大的成绩。
