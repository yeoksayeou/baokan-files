　　Bloody Business
　　According to the Tokyo Times, on July 10, three slave traders were discovered in Sendai City. They sold forty homeless men, women, and children to wealthy people and hotels in the countryside of Tochigi Prefecture, with contracts stipulating a term of twelve years. The price of each child ranged from 6,000 to 10,000 Japanese yen.
　　And Japan's number one slave trader, Yoshida Shigeru, has completely sold out 83 million Japanese people to the United States to be slaves forever.
　　More and more Japanese people are resolutely opposed to this bloody business, both large and small.

　　Belgian People Don't Want Cannons
　　Recently, the American Embassy in Brussels notified the Belgian government that the United States had selected eleven officers from West Germany to serve as technical advisors to the Belgian Army. In addition, the first batch of American cannons has been unloaded at the port of Antwerp as part of American arms assistance.
　　At the same time, the Belgian government publication "Agricultural Review" published a figure showing that compared with 1949, the consumption of food, fats, and other items decreased by 3,350 tons, and the consumption of butter decreased by 2.5 percent.
　　Obviously, what the Belgian people need is bread and butter, not American military advisors and cannons. As the Belgian Communist Party's newspaper "Red Flag" said: After this batch of cannons arrives, all those who cherish Belgian independence should make greater efforts to conclude a five-power peace pact.

    血腥的买卖
    据东京时报报道，七月十日，仙台市发现了三个奴隶贩子，他们把四十个无家可归的男女孩子卖给隷木县乡间的富翁和饭店，契约规定十二年为期。每个孩子的身价从六千日圆到一万日圆。
    而日本的头号奴隶贩子吉田茂正把八千三百万日本人民统统出卖给美国永远作奴隶。
    愈来愈多的日本人民坚决反对这种大大小小的血腥买卖。
    比利时人民不要大炮
    最近，布鲁塞尔的美国大使馆通知比利时政府说：美国已从西德选派了十一个军官充任比利时陆军的技术顾问。另外，第一批美国大炮已在安特卫普海港起卸，这是美国武器援助的一部分。
    与此同时，比利时政府刊物《农业评论》发表了一项数字，说明与一九四九年比较，食物、脂肪等物的消费量减少了三千三百五十吨，黄油的消费量减少了百分之二点五。
    很显然，比利时人民需要的是面包和黄油，而不是美国军事顾问和大炮。正如比利时共产党机关报《红旗报》所说的：这批大炮到达后，所有珍视比利时独立的人应该为缔结五大国和平公约尽更大的努力。
