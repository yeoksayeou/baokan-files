　　Thoroughly Eliminate Aphids and Strive for a Bumper Cotton Harvest!
　　Zhang Xianwen
　　Since late June, cotton aphids have occurred in some provinces of major administrative regions in North China, Central South China, and East China, with the cotton seedlings in cotton-producing areas being the most severely affected. According to preliminary statistics from the Plant Protection Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government in late July, the affected cotton fields in Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Henan provinces totaled approximately 30 million mu. The most severely affected cotton seedlings suffered damage of over 80 percent, while the least affected were still at 20 percent. As a result, a small number of cotton farmers have destroyed their cotton seedlings and switched to planting other crops.
　　The people's governments at all levels in cotton-producing areas have successively issued instructions for a concentrated effort to eliminate aphids and have established anti-pest leadership organizations at all levels, proposing aphid eradication as the central task at present. In provinces with severe pest infestations, provincial agricultural directors and county heads led cadres deep into districts and townships to lead farmers in carrying out patriotic seedling protection and pest eradication campaigns, putting forward the slogan "The movement will not stop until the pests are eliminated." In Hebei Province, each special commissioner's office and county dispatched more than 7,000 cadres. Henan Province dispatched 2,800 administrative cadres and students. Some of them underwent two or three days of training in pest control knowledge, and some counties and districts also held short-term training classes for cotton farmers to impart pest control techniques. Some counties, districts, and townships established pest control headquarters, with technical teams assisting in guidance and supplying farmers with medicines and equipment (sprayers, lime, tobacco water, cotton oil soap, lime-sulfur mixture, etc.).
　　Through the above measures, the mass aphid eradication movement has been launched in the affected areas, basically reversing phenomena such as complaining, waiting, pessimism, and seedling destruction, and enhancing the masses' confidence in pest control.
　　At present, this mass pest eradication movement is still developing, and the aphid infestation situation has gradually improved. However, this improvement trend is not universal. Some lower-level district and township cadres and the masses have not taken action, and aphids are still spreading. In some areas, before the aphids are completely eliminated, new autumn armyworms, spider mites, and weevils have already appeared. Therefore, how to organize forces, prepare medicines and equipment, and mobilize the masses to strive to ensure a bumper cotton harvest is a serious task for the Party, government, and people in the affected areas. What should we pay attention to at present?
　　(1) We must continue to constantly and repeatedly educate farmers on patriotic cotton protection, thoroughly eliminate negative emotions such as weariness, pessimism, and resentment, launch challenges, and establish patriotic cotton protection pledges. Because this aphid infestation is particularly serious, it must be continuously treated to be effective. The idea of treating it once and being done with it is very dangerous. In general areas of Hebei Province, it has been treated twice. In Xixinzhai Village, Nanhe County, 520 mu of cotton fields have been treated ten times. In Xiaoguanzhuang, Ren County, the aphid eradication pledge stipulates: (1) All men and women who can eradicate aphids should go to the fields together to ensure that the cotton is not harmed; (2) Eliminate aphids as soon as they are discovered, and if one treatment is not enough, do a second treatment; (3) If one household cannot complete the treatment, the whole group will help. As a result, the men and women of the village treated 210 mu in one day.
　　(2) Due to the wide and large-scale occurrence of cotton aphids this time, there is a general feeling of lack of medicines and equipment in the affected areas. Therefore, the method of using indigenous medicines should be promoted. Some areas in Shandong Province have adopted the method of using local materials and adapting to local conditions, giving play to the creativity of the masses, and promoting all usable indigenous methods. Cooperatives are responsible for purchasing the medicines and equipment used by farmers,打击了投械商人抬价渔利、降低药品质量的行为. In Shanxi Province, mountain elm strips and starfruit root water have been tried in mountainous areas to treat aphids, and they are very effective. The idea of relying solely on government supply of medicines and equipment in areas with severe aphid infestations must be corrected to avoid missing the big picture.
　　(3) At present, the masses in the affected areas urgently need technical guidance and must be given active assistance as much as possible. Some local governments in the affected areas have dispatched cadres and technicians to the countryside to establish technical transmission stations, impart medicine dispensing methods, and organize the masses to visit aphid control, which have played a positive role. Qu Yang County, Hebei Province, established 35 pest control stations, imparting technology and dispensing a large amount of medicine, ensuring that each village had timely access to medicine. A farmer in Ningjin County never believed that medicines could cure aphids. After visiting the village chief dispensing medicine to control aphids, he immediately went home and did the same. However, in some areas, there have been cases of indiscriminate use of indigenous methods to control aphids, causing damage to cotton seedlings, which should be paid attention to.
　　(4) There are many crash campaigns in cotton-producing areas during this period. Before the aphids are completely controlled, spider mites, weevils, and autumn armyworms are occurring again, and cotton purchase and storage, summer grain requisition, and flood prevention cannot be relaxed. How to organize forces and properly arrange and combine these crash campaigns to avoid losing sight of one thing while attending to another has become a problem that must be solved in cotton-producing areas. According to the different degrees of aphid infestation in each district and village, Linzhang County, Hebei Province, determined that the severely affected areas should focus on aphid eradication in combination with cotton purchase, while the lightly affected areas should vigorously carry out cotton purchase and storage without hindering aphid eradication. This method can be used as a reference for various places.
　　It is now the flowering and boll-forming period of cotton seedlings. We must raise pest control to its proper important position and must not have the idea that "the aphids will be gone after it rains." Aphids were found on cotton seedlings in cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province in June, and there was a heavy rain at the end of June, but the cotton aphids did not stop developing. The cotton aphids in Pingyuan Province were not paid attention to when they first occurred, resulting in serious losses to cotton fields. These lessons must be remembered! At present, leading organs and cadres in various cotton-producing areas are correcting the masses' thinking of fearing difficulties and weariness and resolutely implementing the policy of "early treatment, universal treatment, and clean treatment," which is completely correct.

### 彻底消灭蚜害，争取棉花丰收！

　　彻底消灭蚜害，争取棉花丰收！
    张先文
    六月下旬以来，棉蚜虫在华北、中南、华东各大行政区部分省份发生，尤以产棉区棉苗受害最重。根据中央人民政府农业部病虫害防治司七月下旬初步统计，河北、平原、山东、山西、河南五个省份，受害棉田约达三千万亩左右。棉苗受害程度最重者达百分之八十以上，最轻者亦在百分之二十。因此，有少数棉农已毁掉棉苗，改种其他作物。
    产棉区各级人民政府已先后发出突击灭蚜的指示，并成立了各级灭虫领导机构，提出以灭蚜为当前中心任务。虫害严重的省份，省农业厅长、县长等率领干部深入区乡，领导农民开展爱国保苗灭虫运动，提出“虫害不灭运动不止”的口号。河北省各专署、县派出干部七千多人，河南省派出行政干部、学生等亦达二千八百余人。他们有的是经过了两三天除虫知识的训练，有的县区还举办了棉农短期训练班，传授除虫技术。有的县、区、乡成立了治虫指挥部，技术小组协助指导，以药械（喷雾器、石灰、烟草水，棉油皂，石灰硫磺合剂等等）供应棉农使用。
    经过以上种种措施，目前虫灾地区群众性的灭蚜运动已经开展起来，基本上扭转了埋怨、等待、悲观、毁苗等现象，增强了群众治虫信心。
    目前，这一群众性的灭虫运动还在发展，蚜虫灾势已渐好转。但是，这一好转趋势并不是普遍的，有些地区的下层区乡干部和群众，并没有行动起来，蚜虫还在蔓延。有的地区蚜虫未治完，新的秋蝻、红蜘蛛、象鼻虫又已发生。因此，今后如何组织力量、准备药械，使群众振作起来为确保棉花丰收而奋斗，是当前虫害地区党、政、民的严重任务。目前需要注意些什么呢？
    （一）要继续不断地、反复地向农民进行爱国保棉教育，彻底消除厌倦、悲观、埋怨等消极情绪，发动挑战，订立爱国保棉公约。因为这次蚜虫特别严重，必须连续不断地除治才能见效，那种治一遍就算了事的想法是很危险的。河北省一般的地区已除治两遍；南和县西新寨村棉田五百二十亩除治了十遍。任县小官庄在灭蚜公约上规定着：（１）凡能灭蚜的男女都一齐下地，保证棉花不受害；（２）随发现随消灭，一遍治不完，再治第二遍；（３）一户治不完，全组来帮助。结果该村男女一天治了二百一十亩。
    （二）由于这次棉蚜发生的广而多，虫害区普遍感到药械缺乏。因此，采用土药的办法应加提倡。山东省有些地区已采用就地取材，因地制宜办法，发挥群众的创造性，推广一切可以使用的土办法。农民所用药械统由合作社负责采购，打击了投械商人抬价渔利、降低药品质量的行为。山西省在山地曾试用山槐条及杨桃根水治蚜，都很有效。有些蚜虫情况严重地区单纯依靠政府供给药械，这种思想必须纠正，以免贻误大事。
    （三）目前虫害地区群众迫切要求技术指导，必须尽可能积极地予以帮助。有些虫害区地方政府派出干部、技术人员下乡，建立技术传授站，传授配药方法，组织群众治蚜参观，都起了积极作用。河北省曲阳县建立了三十五个除虫站，传授技术和大量配药，保证了各村的及时用药。宁晋县一个农民一贯不相信药品能治蚜虫，经过参观村长配药治蚜后，回家马上也照着办了。但有的地区曾发生过乱用土法治蚜，使棉苗受损的现象，应加注意。
    （四）这一时期产棉区突击工作很多。蚜虫还没治好，红蜘蛛、象鼻虫、秋蝻又在发生，购棉储棉、夏征、防汛都还不能松懈。如何组织力量，并将这些突击工作加以适当的安排与结合，免得顾此失彼，已成为产棉区必须解决的问题。河北省临漳县根据各区村蚜灾不同程度，确定重灾区以灭蚜为主，结合购棉；轻灾区在不防碍灭蚜的条件下，大力开展购棉储棉工作。这办法可供各地参考。
    目前正值棉苗开花结铃时期，我们必须将治虫工作提高到应有的重要地位，丝毫不能存在“下了雨蚜虫就完事”的想法。河北省产棉区六月间棉苗就发现蚜虫，六月底曾下过大雨，棉蚜并未停止发展。平原省棉蚜开始发生时未予注意，以至棉田遭受严重损失。这些教训必须记取！现在产棉区各地领导机关干部正在纠正群众畏难厌倦的思想，坚决贯彻人力“及早治、普遍治、治干净”的方针，这是完全正确的。
