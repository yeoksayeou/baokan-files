　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 8th: While stepping up preparations with the United States for a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have also lifted the purge penalties for over ten thousand Japanese fascists. This is yet another heinous measure by the United States, in violation of the Potsdam Declaration, to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism.
    With the approval of the U.S. occupation headquarters in Japan, the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan announced on the 6th the lifting of purges for 13,905 fascists, restoring their rights to hold public office. Since last October, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have lifted the purges for Japanese fascists on a large scale four times, totaling approximately 98,000 people, nearly half of the total number purged after the war.
    Among those who have had their purges lifted this time, military personnel account for more than 7,800, including more than 6,600 regular army and navy officers, more than 280 military police personnel, and more than 770 special service agency personnel. In addition, there are: more than 2,500 responsible personnel from extreme nationalist and violent groups, more than 1,800 responsible personnel from fascist groups such as the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society, more than 350 cadres of financial and "development" institutions related to Japanese aggression, more than 100 fascist elements who served as cabinet ministers and government officials during the war, and more than 150 members of the Diet recommended by Tojo, etc.
    Many notoriously sinful fascist war criminals have had their purges lifted, including Ichiro Hatoyama, who participated in drafting the "Tanaka Memorial" plan for invading China and once served as president of the Democratic Liberal Party (the predecessor of the Liberal Party) after the war; Jotaro Kawakami, general secretary of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society; Yuio Ohama, state minister in the Tojo cabinet; Yonezo Maeda, minister of transport and communications in the Koiso cabinet; Takeo Ogata, president of the information bureau in the Koiso cabinet; Inosuke Furuno, president of Domei News Agency; and Zaibatsu figures Masatsune Ogura, Tatsunosuke Takasaki, Ginjiro Fujiwara, Ichizo Kobayashi, Kiyoshi Kyogu, Tadaharu Mukai, and others.

　　美日反动派加紧复活日本军国主义
    鸠山一郎等一万余名法西斯分子又被解除整肃处分
    【新华社八日讯】东京消息：与美国加紧筹划单独对日媾和、武装日本的同时，美、日反动派又解除了一万多名日本法西斯分子的整肃处分。这是美国违反波茨坦公告，加速复活日本军国主义的又一罪恶措施。
    经过美国驻日占领军总部的批准，日本吉田反动政府在六日宣布解除一万三千九百零五名法西斯分子的整肃，恢复他们担任公共职务的权利。自去年十月以来，美、日反动派已四度大规模对日本法西斯分子解除整肃，人数共达九万八千名左右，将近战后被整肃的总数的一半。
    在这次被解除整肃的人当中，军事人员占七千八百多名，包括正规陆海军军官六千六百多人，宪兵人员二百八十多名，特务机关工作人员七百七十多人。此外还有：极端国家主义与暴力主义团体的负责人员二千五百多人，大政翼赞会、翼赞政治会等法西斯团体的负责人员一千八百多人，和日本侵略有关的金融与“开发”机关的干部三百五十多人，战时曾任内阁大臣及政府机关官员的法西斯分子一百多人，东条推荐的国会议员一百五十多人等等。
    许多罪恶昭彰的法西斯战犯都被解除了整肃，其中包括参与起草“田中奏折”侵华计划、战后一度出任民主自由党（自由党的前身）总裁的鸠山一郎，翼赞政治会总务河上丈太郎，东条内阁国务相大麻唯男，小矶内阁运输通信相前田米藏，小矶内阁情报局总裁绪方竹虎，同盟社社长古野伊之助，财阀小仓正恒、高崎达之助、藤原银次郎、小林一三、乡古洁、向井忠晴等人。
