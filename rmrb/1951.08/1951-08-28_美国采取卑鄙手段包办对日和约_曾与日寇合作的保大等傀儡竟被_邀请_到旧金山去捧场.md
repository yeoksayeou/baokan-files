Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: The United States on August 22nd openly and formally "invited" the three French puppet regimes of Bảo Đại, Laos, and Cambodia, who had collaborated with Japanese imperialism during the war, to participate in the San Francisco Peace Treaty Conference.

As early as June this year, when the American war-profiteer Dulles held negotiations with the French government on the Japanese peace treaty issue, Dulles reached a tacit understanding with France to allow puppet regimes such as Bảo Đại to participate in the signing of a separate peace treaty with Japan, in exchange for France's support for the American-made peace treaty with Japan. However, this despicable tacit understanding was so shameful that the United States was slow to announce this "invitation." A French News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 23rd revealed: "The U.S. government has long delayed inviting Indochina in order to avoid India's explicit refusal to participate in the conference, as India has not recognized the three member states of Indochina and denies their independence."

Now, as the San Francisco conference is about to begin, under France's repeated urging, the United States has been forced to announce the "invitation" to puppet regimes such as Bảo Đại to participate in the San Francisco conference. This measure by the United States further proves the U.S. government's arbitrary, dictatorial, despicable and shameless behavior in concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan.

　　美国采取卑鄙手段包办对日和约
    曾与日寇合作的保大等傀儡竟被“邀请”到旧金山去捧场
    【新华社二十七日讯】美国在八月二十二日公然正式“邀请”战时曾与日本帝国主义合作的保大、老挝、柬埔寨三个法国傀儡政权，参加旧金山对日和约会议。
    早在今年六月间，美国战贩杜勒斯与法国政府举行对日和约问题谈判时，杜勒斯就曾与法国成立默契，允许保大等傀儡政权参加签订单独对日和约，以换取法国对美制对日和约的支持。但是，这一卑鄙的默契是这样的见不得人，以致美国迟迟没有宣布这个“邀请”。法新社华盛顿二十三日电透露：“美国政府曾长期延迟邀请印度支那，目的是为了避免印度的明确拒绝参加和会，印度是未承认印度支那三个成员国并否认它们的独立的。”
    现在由于旧金山会议即将开始，在法国的一再催促下，美国迫不得已地宣布“邀请”保大等傀儡政权参加旧金山会议。美国这一措施，益发证明美国政府在缔结单独对日和约问题上的专横独断和卑鄙无耻。
