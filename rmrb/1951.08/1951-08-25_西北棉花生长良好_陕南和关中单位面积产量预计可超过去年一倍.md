　　Northwest Cotton Grows Well
    Expected Unit Area Yields in Southern Shaanxi and Guanzhong to Exceed Last Year's by a Factor of Two
    Cotton is growing well in all cotton-producing areas of the Northwest this year. The unit area yield of cotton in southern Shaanxi and Guanzhong this year is expected to exceed last year's yield by about a factor of two. Cotton is also growing vigorously in the new cotton-growing areas of northern Xinjiang and Gansu this year. New cotton will be on the market in September, and cooperatives at all levels are actively preparing to purchase it.
    The reason why cotton is growing well this year is that, in addition to the suitable weather and rainfall, the masses have learned from practice about the various policies of the People's Government to reward and support cotton planting, and have actively carried out patriotic cotton protection work. This year, before cotton sowing, the land was generally plowed three times in all areas, and in many places the seeds were selected and treated. The People's Governments of the cotton-producing areas also promptly lent out large quantities of high-quality cotton seeds and various fertilizers, creating good conditions for cotton seedling growth. In Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi alone, 2 million catties of improved varieties were lent out. In the new cotton area of northern Xinjiang, with the help of the People's Government, improved varieties from the Soviet Union were introduced and promoted this year. This year, cotton farmers in Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi borrowed more than 2 million catties of fertilizers such as oil cake and bean cake, and 2,000 tons of chemical fertilizer (ammonium sulfate). In July, cotton aphids and other pests and diseases occurred in the cotton fields of Shaanxi Province. The local Party and government organs at all levels actively mobilized all forces to rescue the cotton and led the cotton farmers to launch a patriotic movement to protect cotton by preventing and controlling pests and diseases.
    This year, the masses know that the good growth of cotton in various places is due to the good leadership of the government. Chen Zuozhen, a model agricultural worker in Lanzhou, said: "The People's Government leads us to fight against natural disasters. When it doesn't rain, the government leads us to plant seeds; when cotton aphids occur, the government leads us to prevent and control them. In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, no one cared about our life or death." In particular, the patriotic cotton sales and storage movement launched in June, July, and August carried out patriotic education among cotton farmers and greatly improved the political consciousness of cotton farmers. Many cotton farmers have realized that growing more cotton and ensuring the supply of raw materials to factories is a patriotic movement to oppose the blockade of U.S. imperialism and strive for cotton self-sufficiency. This also inspired the cotton farmers' enthusiasm for the patriotic cotton protection movement. In Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, more than 1,000 mutual aid groups have joined the patriotic cotton protection competition and guaranteed that after the new cotton is on the market, all of it except for self-use will be sold to the state.
    At present, cooperatives at all levels in the Guanzhong area are actively preparing to purchase new cotton, and have prepared more than 4.8 billion yuan in funds to renovate warehouses and purchase and repair various processing equipment; the cooperative offices in each special zone are planning to hold short-term training classes for technical and accounting personnel, so that each grass-roots cooperative will have a technical cadre with specialized knowledge of cotton purchasing in the future. In order to improve the quality of ginned cotton and meet the requirements of the national textile industry, the cooperatives are preparing to rent a large number of cotton gins from members or non-members to form cotton ginning teams with the cooperatives' existing cotton gins, and to rotate to various villages to gin cotton in a planned manner. At present, under the leadership of the Party committees and People's Governments at all levels, the cooperatives in various places are carrying out publicity work for the "Patriotic Cotton Sales Movement," widely publicizing to cotton farmers that they should pay attention to not mixing impurities when picking and drying cotton, and try to improve the quality of cotton.

### 西北棉花生长良好  陕南和关中单位面积产量预计可超过去年一倍

　　西北棉花生长良好
    陕南和关中单位面积产量预计可超过去年一倍
    西北各产棉区，今年棉花生长良好。陕南和关中今年棉花单位面积的产量，预计可超过去年产量的一倍左右。新疆北部新棉区和甘肃今年棉花也都长得很旺。新棉将于九月间上市，各级合作社正积极准备收购新棉。
    今年棉花长得好的原因，除去天气和雨量合宜外，主要是群众从实际中了解人民政府奖励和扶助植棉的各项政策，积极地进行了爱国保棉工作的结果。今年各地在棉花播种前，一般地均耕犁过三次，不少地方种籽都作到了粒选和拌种。各产棉区人民政府并及时贷放了大量的优良棉种和各种肥料，创造了棉苗生长的良好条件。单是陕西的关中和陕南贷放的良种就有二百万斤。北疆新棉区在人民政府帮助下今年引种和推广了苏联的优良品种。关中和陕南的棉农，今年就贷到油渣、豆饼等肥料二百余万斤，化学肥料（硫酸铔）两千吨。七月间陕西地区棉花发生了棉蚜等病虫灾害，当地各级党、政机关积极动员一切力量抢救，领导棉农展开了爱国保棉的防治病虫害运动。
    今年各地棉花长得好，群众都知道是由于政府领导得好。兰州农业劳动模范陈作桢说：“人民政府领导我们和自然灾害作了斗争。不下雨，政府领导我们点种；生棉蚜，政府领导我们防治。在过去国民党反动统治时，没有人管我们的死活。”尤其是在六、七、八三个月内开展爱国售棉储棉运动中，对棉农进行了爱国主义教育，大大提高了植棉农民的政治觉悟。许多棉农已认识了多种棉花、保证供应工厂原料，是反对美帝国主义的封锁、争取棉花自给的爱国运动。这也鼓舞了棉农爱国保棉运动的热情。陕西省兴平县有一千多个互助组卷入了爱国保棉竞赛，并保证：新花上市后，除自用外全部卖给国家。
    现在，关中区各级合作社收购新棉的准备工作正积极进行，已准备以四十八亿多元的资金整修仓房和购置、修理各种加工设备；各专区合作办事处正计划举办短期的技术、会计人员训练班，使每个基层合作社将来能有一个具有购棉专门知识的技术干部。为了提高皮棉品质，适应全国纺织工业的要求，各地合作社准备向社员或非社员租赁大批轧花机，与合作社现有的轧花机合组轧花队，有计划地轮流到各村轧花。目前各地合作社在各级中共党委、人民政府领导下，正进行“爱国售棉运动”的宣传工作，广泛向棉农宣传拾花、晒花时要注意不混入杂质，尽量提高棉花的品质。
