    The US Side Brazenly Violates its Assumed Obligations
    Once Again Exposing its Lack of Sincerity in Establishing Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 12th] TASS, Pyongyang, August 11th: The Korean Central News Agency broadcast a telegram from its Kaesong reporter, entitled "American Representatives Brazenly Violate Their Obligations." The telegram comments on the protest lodged by General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, regarding the incident of American aircraft strafing supply trucks of the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army with machine guns.

    The telegram emphasizes: The American ruling circles, using negotiations as a smokescreen, are preparing to expand the war and shamelessly violating the obligations they have undertaken. By doing so, they have once again exposed themselves as liars and enemies of peace, participating in negotiations without any sincerity in promoting the establishment of peace in Korea.

    After pointing out many examples of the US side violating its assumed obligations, the reporter said: The perfidious actions of the US side have been met with fierce condemnation from all the Korean people and the freedom-loving people of all countries around the world.

    再度暴露其无建立和平诚意
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社平壤十一日讯：朝鲜中央通讯社广播该社开城记者所写的“美国代表悍然违反他们的义务”的电讯。该电讯评论朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军首席代表南日将军所提出的关于美国飞机用机枪扫射朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团的供应卡车一事的抗议。
    该电讯着重指出：美国统治集团利用谈判作烟幕，正在准备扩大战争，并厚颜无耻地破坏他们所承担的义务。他们这样做，再度暴露了他们是说谎者与和平的敌人，他们参加谈判没有抱着促使建立朝鲜和平的诚意。
    在指出美方违反它所担当的义务的许多例子后，记者说：美方这种弃信背义的行为受到了全体朝鲜人民和全世界爱好自由的各国人民的猛烈谴责。
