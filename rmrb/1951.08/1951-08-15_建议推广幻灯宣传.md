　　Suggest Promoting Slide Shows for Propaganda
    I think that while our films cannot yet be widely shown in the vast countryside, using slide shows for propaganda work is a powerful tool. Especially in the countryside, newspapers and magazines are scarce, and the cultural level of ordinary farmers is relatively low. It is most appropriate and most welcome for them to watch slide shows. I hope that the relevant cultural and propaganda departments in various places will make more use of this tool. Regarding the content of the slides, I think that in addition to screening propaganda films about the three great patriotic movements of resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, we should combine them with the specific situation of the local area, drawing typical deeds or experience introductions of labor, production, and learning models. This can better educate the masses. For example, after our school's cultural troupe went deep into the company and discovered typical examples of classes and individuals, they immediately drew pictures and screened them at small entertainment evenings in the company, which was very popular among the trainees and played a significant encouraging role. Some trainees said: "Everyone should work hard and strive to be on the slides."
    Although slide show propaganda is simpler and more economical than film propaganda, drawing the slides is still a rather difficult problem. Therefore, I hope that relevant departments will collect more heroic and model deeds and other relevant propaganda materials, draw them into colorful pictures, print them on cellophane, and then add instructions to make a complete set of slides to be sold in bookstores across the country. This will not only reduce the difficulty of drawing slides in various places, but also better promote slide show propaganda work.

### 建议推广幻灯宣传

　　建议推广幻灯宣传
    我觉得目前我国电影还不能在广大的农村中普遍放映的时候，利用幻灯进行宣传工作，是一种有力的工具。特别在乡下，报纸和杂志都很少，一般农民的文化水平又较低，用幻灯放映画片给他们看最合适。也是他们最欢迎的，希望各地有关的文化宣传部门多多利用这种工具。关于幻灯片的内容，我认为除放映抗美援朝、土地改革及镇压反革命的三大爱国运动的宣传片外，应结合当地的具体情况，绘制劳动、生产、学习等模范的典型事迹或经验介绍，这样更能教育群众。例如我校文工团深入连队，发现班与个人的典型事例后，即刻绘出图片在连队的小型娱乐晚会上放映，很受学员的欢迎，起了不少鼓励作用。有的学员说：“大家要用功，争取上幻灯。”
    虽然幻灯较电影宣传简便，又经济。但是绘制片子还是一个相当困难的问题。因此，我希望有关部门多收集一些英雄、模范事迹，及其他有关的宣传材料，绘成五彩图片，印在玻璃纸上，另外再配上说明书，制成整套的幻灯片子在全国各地书店出售。这样，不但能减少各地绘片的困难，同时能更好地推广幻灯的宣传工作。
