　　Cultural Life Dynamics
　　　　　　*“Illustrated Popular Edition of the Regulations for the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries” Sells Widely*
　　The “Illustrated Popular Edition of the Regulations for the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries,” published by the East China People's Publishing House in May of this year, has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses. The current total distribution has exceeded six million copies, creating the highest record for book printing and sales in the East China region. It has played a significant role in popularizing the publicity and education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and suppressing counterrevolutionaries. The main content of this book is to explain the basic spirit of the Regulations for the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries through images. It uses illustrations to provide popular explanations to the masses, meeting the needs of the masses and greatly increasing their interest in political learning. After the publication of this book, the masses hope that the People's Publishing Houses in various regions will organize local art workers to widely introduce the government's important policies and decrees to the masses in the form of illustrated popular editions. This is a direction that should be worked towards. The good organization of the distribution work is also a reason why this book has been sold in large quantities and has deeply penetrated various regions. The staff of Xinhua Bookstores in various parts of East China have fully exerted their enthusiasm and continuously strived to increase sales quotas, thus creating the highest distribution record. Relevant parties in East China should carefully summarize the experience of this work, and other regions across the country should also learn from the experience of this work, and strive to provide the people of the whole country with more and better popular reading materials.
　　　　　　*Guangzhou Launches Political and Ideological Education for Workers*
　　The Propaganda Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education, and the Guangzhou People's Broadcasting Station, in order to further systematically strengthen the patriotic education of the city's 200,000 employees, jointly formed the Workers' Political Lecture Broadcasting Committee to hold "Workers' Political Lectures" as a unified political lesson for the city's workers, conducting systematic political and ideological education for the broad masses of workers. They also notified the administrative, capitalist, and trade union organizations at all levels of state-owned and private factories and enterprises throughout the city to pay attention to the broadcast lectures, mobilize and organize employees to listen, and lead employees to conduct study and discussion.
　　　　　　*The Cultural Troupe of the North China People's Revolutionary University Performs the Soviet Play “Cold War” in Beijing*
　　The Cultural Troupe of the North China People's Revolutionary University recently performed the Soviet play “Cold War,” co-authored by the Tur brothers, in Beijing. This play exposes how the U.S. imperialists, through their embassy in the Soviet Union, carry out conspiracies to oppose the Soviet Union, undermine peace, and launch a new war. The conspirators eventually suffered a shameful defeat. The characters depicted in the play are full of personality, and the dialogue is vivid, profound, and full of wit and sharp irony against the enemy. The performance of "Cold War" by the troupe at this time has its positive significance. It is a vivid international political education for the audience. Because this is a translated script, some of the lines are not translated in a popular way, making it difficult for the average audience to fully understand, which is a shortcoming.
　　　　　　*The Rehe Provincial Department of Culture and Education Instructs Cities, Counties (Banners) to Seize the Slack Season to Carry Out Farmers' Spare-Time Education*
　　The Rehe Provincial People's Government Department of Culture and Education issued instructions in mid-July on carrying out farmers' spare-time education during the slack farming season, requiring all counties to seize the slack farming season to restore and rectify people's schools, help farmers review old lessons, conscientiously do a good job in the short-term training of village cultural and educational committee members and mass teachers, cultivate a large number of leading backbones and teachers for people's schools, and combine anti-US aggression and aid-Korea patriotic ideological education to implement the policy of literacy education as the main focus; and closely integrate with the current various movements, educate the masses to actively respond to the various calls of the People's Government, so as to run farmers' spare-time education well during the slack farming season, and lay a more solid foundation for carrying out winter school this year.
　　　　　　*The Eighth Issue of “Central and South China Farmer” is Published*
　　The “Central and South China Farmer” magazine (bi-monthly), sponsored by the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, was launched in mid-April this year, and eight issues have been published by August 1. This is an extremely popular magazine that uses various lively forms such as short articles, newsletters, speeches, Q&As, comic strips, and ballads to conduct current affairs, political, land reform, production, and cultural education to farmers. In the recently published eighth issue of the magazine, articles commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day by Zhao Xingyuan, combat hero of the Central and South China Military Region and the Fourth Field Army, and Guo Junqing, female combat hero, were published. In this issue of "Little Talks," rural cadres, party members, and farmers are called upon to study the history of the Party; criticized some cadres' "relaxed" thinking of slackening vigilance against landlords and slackening work; guided farmers in areas undergoing rent reduction and deposit refund to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, do a good job of internal unity, and strive for the victory of the struggle. In order to educate rural Communist Party members on communism and Mao Zedong Thought, the magazine has published "Textbooks for Rural Communist Party Members" in each issue since the fifth issue for rural party members to study. In order to solve the problem of farmers' cultural learning, the magazine has published "Elementary Cultural Textbooks for Farmers' Spare-time Schools" in each issue since the second issue to help farmers with cultural learning. The publication of "Central and South China Farmer" has received the attention of governments and the broad masses in rural areas of Central and South China. Using various popular forms to conduct political and ideological education to the broad masses is a direction that should be greatly promoted at present.
　　　　　　*The Anthropology Museum of Moscow University in the Soviet Union Sends Models of Important Cultural Relics to Our Country*
　　In order to promote academic exchanges between China and the Soviet Union and strengthen the scientific work connections between the two countries, the Anthropology Museum of Moscow University in the Soviet Union specially presented to the relevant departments of our country a restored male and female head model of "Peking Man" and a model of human skull fossils each, and requested the exchange of stone tools and animal fossils from the "Peking Man" period. The gifted items have been allocated by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government to the Mineral Geology Exploration and Mining Bureau of the China Geological Work Planning Guidance Committee for preservation, and the bureau has handed over 32 animal fossils and stone tool models from the "Peking Man" period to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country for transfer to the Anthropology Museum of Moscow University in the Soviet Union.

　　　　　　*Linguistic Special Issue: "Research on Sani Yi Language" Published*
　　"Research on Sani Yi Language" by Ma Xueliang has been listed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences as the second type of linguistic special issue and recently published by the Commercial Press. The book makes a special study of the phonology and grammar of the Sani dialect in the Yi language branch of the Tibetan-Burman language family, and collects the vocabulary of the Sani language and annotates it with Chinese meanings. The original manuscript of the book was completed in 1946 and is the author's harvest from a long-term study of the Yi language and script among the Yi people. This is a book worth noting. Conducting scientific research on the languages of our country's minority brothers and sisters is a major task for the academic community—especially linguists.
　　　　　　*“New Literature Anthology” Published Successively*
　　The “New Literature Anthology,” edited by the New Literature Anthology Editorial Committee of the Central Ministry of Culture, has been published successively by Kaiming Bookstore. This series of anthologies selects realistic literary works by new Chinese writers since the “May Fourth” Movement, with the aim of enabling readers to gain a basic understanding of the development of new Chinese literature in the most economical time and effort. The anthology is temporarily divided into the first and second series, encompassing a total of twenty-four writers. The published selections include Xu Dishan, Rou Shi, Hu Yepin, Yin Fu, Hong Lingfei, Wen Yiduo, Ai Qing, Ba Jin, Hong Shen, Lu Yan, Zhu Ziqing, Zhao Shuli, and twelve other selections. Other selections such as Jiang Guangci, Ye Shengtao, and Zhang Tianyi will be published soon. These writers' selections are either self-selected by the writers themselves or selected by specialists invited by the editorial board of the series, such as the works of deceased writers and martyrs.

　　文化生活动态
            《惩治反革命条例图解通俗本》大量销行
    华东人民出版社本年五月份出版的《惩治反革命条例图解通俗本》，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎，目前的发行总数已超过六百万份，创造了华东地区书籍印数和销数的最高纪录，对普及抗美援朝、镇压反革命的宣传教育，起了很大的作用。这本书的主要内容是以画面的形象来解释惩治反革命条例的基本精神，通过图解向群众进行通俗的说明，切合群众的需要，并大大提高了群众学习政治的兴趣。这一本书出版后，群众更希望各地人民出版社组织各地的美术工作者，有计划地把政府各项重要政策法令，用图解通俗本的形式广泛地介绍到群众中去。这是一个应该努力的方向。这一本书所以能够大量销行，深入各地，发行工作组织得良好也是一个原因。华东全区各地新华书店的工作人员都充分发挥了积极性，不断争取销行定额的提高，因而创造了最高的发行纪录。华东各有关方面应该很好地总结这次工作的经验，全国其他各地区也应该很好地学习这次工作的经验，为供给全国人民更多更好的通俗读物而努力。
            广州市开展工人政治思想教育
    中共广州市委会宣传部、广东省总工会筹备会文教部、广州市总工会筹备会文教部、广州市人民政府文教局、广州市人民广播电台，为进一步有系统地加强对该市二十万职工的爱国主义教育，联合组成工人政治讲座广播委员会，举办“工人政治讲座”，作为该市工人统一的政治大课，对广大工人群众进行有系统的政治、思想教育。并通知全市各国营和私营工厂企业行政、资方和各级工会组织重视广播讲座，发动组织职工收听，领导职工进行学习讨论。
            华北人民革命大学文工团在北京上演苏联名剧《冷战》
    华北人民革命大学文工团最近在北京上演苏联作家屠尔兄弟合著的名剧《冷战》。这个剧本暴露了美帝国主义者如何通过它自己的驻苏大使馆，来进行反对苏联，破坏和平，发动新战争的阴谋。阴谋分子终于遭到了可耻的失败。剧中所描写的人物富有个性，对话也很生动、深刻，充满着机智和对敌人的尖锐的讽刺。该团在这时演出《冷战》是有其积极意义的。它对观众是一种生动的国际政治的教育。由于这是一个翻译剧本，一部分台词翻译得不够通俗，使得一般普通观众不易完全听懂，是一个缺点。
          热河文教厅指示各市、县（旗）抓紧农闲开展农民业余教育
    热河省人民政府文教厅在七月中旬发布了关于开展挂锄期间农民业余教育的指示，要求各县抓紧挂锄期间进行恢复与整顿民校学习，帮助农民复习旧课，认真做好村文教委员和群众教师的短期训练工作，培养大批民校领导骨干和师资，结合抗美援朝爱国主义思想教育，贯彻以识字教育为主的方针；并和当前各种运动密切结合，教育群众积极响应人民政府的各项号召，从而办好挂锄期间的农民业余教育工作，为今年开展冬学打下更巩固的基础。
            《中南农民》第八期出版
    中共中央中南局主办的《中南农民》杂志（半月刊）于今年四月中旬创刊，至八月一日已出版八期。这是一个运用各种短文、通讯、讲话、问答、连环图画、歌谣等活泼的形式，向农民进行时事、政治、土地改革、生产及文化教育的极其通俗的杂志。在该杂志最近出版的第八期上，刊登了中南军区暨第四野战军战斗英雄赵兴元及女战斗英雄郭俊卿纪念“八一”建军节的文章。在这一期的《小讲话》里，号召农村干部、党员、农民学习党的历史；批判了某些干部对地主放松警惕、工作松懈的“松一口气”思想；指导正在进行退租退押地区的农民分清敌我，搞好内部团结，争取斗争的胜利。为了对农村共产党员进行共产主义、毛泽东思想的教育，该杂志从第五期起每期刊登《农村共产党员课本》，供农村党员学习。为了解决农民文化学习问题，该杂志从第二期起即逐期刊登《农民业余学校初级文化课本》，帮助农民进行文化学习。《中南农民》的出版，受到了中南各地政府及农村广大群众的重视。运用各种通俗的形式，向广大群众进行政治、思想教育，是当前一个应该大大提倡的方向。
            苏联莫斯科大学人类学博物馆将重要文物的模型送赠我国
    苏联莫斯科大学人类学博物馆，为了促进中苏两国学术上的交流、加强两国科学工作的联系，特将该馆所制的复原“北京人”男女头像模型及人类头骨化石模型各一件，赠给我国有关机关，要求交换“北京人”时期的石器及动物化石。读项赠品已由中央人民政府文化部拨交给中国地质工作计划指导委员会矿产地质勘采局保存，并由该局将“北京人”时期之动物化石及石器模型等三十二件，交由我国外交部转赠给苏联莫斯科大学人类学博物馆。

            语言学专刊：《撒尼彝语研究》出版
    马学良所著《撒尼彝语研究》，由中国科学院列为语言学专刊第二种，最近由商务印书馆出版。该书对藏缅语系彝语支中的撒尼方言，就其音韵和语法，作了专门的研究，并搜集了撒尼语的词汇，注以汉义。该书原稿成于一九四六年，是作者在彝族人民中长期学习彝语、彝文的收获。这是一部值得注意的书。对于我国少数兄弟民族的语文进行科学的研究，是学术界——特别是语言学工作者的重大任务。
            《新文学选集》陆续出版
    中央文化部新文学选集编辑委员会编辑的《新文学选集》，已由开明书店陆续出版。这套丛书选集了“五四”以来我国新文学作家的现实主义的文学作品，目的在使读者用最经济的时间和精力对我国新文学的发展获得基本的认识。选集暂分第一、二两辑，共包罗作家二十四人。现已出版的有许地山、柔石、胡也频、殷夫、洪灵菲、闻一多、艾青、巴金、洪深、鲁彦、朱自清、赵树理等选集十二种，其他如蒋光慈、叶圣陶、张天翼等选集最近即可出版。这些作家的选集有为作家本人自选的，也有由该丛书编委会的请专人代选的，如已故诸作家及烈士的作品。
