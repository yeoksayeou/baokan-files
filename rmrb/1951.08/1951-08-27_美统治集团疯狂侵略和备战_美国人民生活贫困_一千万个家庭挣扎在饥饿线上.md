Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 26th: As the US ruling clique's policies of aggression and war preparations drive up domestic living costs, the American people are being forced to struggle on the brink of starvation. A report released on the 18th by the Joint Committee on the Economic Report of the US Congress admits that currently, ten million American families have incomes barely sufficient to keep them alive.

The Joint Committee on the Economic Report, after investigating one hundred representative families with annual incomes below $2,000, acknowledged that the circumstances of these families reflect "poor jobs, poor health, poor housing, poor food, and an inability to obtain education and skills." One of the examples cited in the report illustrates that in Providence, Rhode Island, a truck driver with an annual income of $1,924 has to support his wife and ten children.

Low incomes force these families to tighten their belts to survive. According to United Press, "The committee's report states: 'The most common way to cut food costs is to eliminate meat and milk except for infants. This means eating only vegetarian meals consisting of bread, potatoes, macaroni, noodles, and rice.' To reduce expenses, people commonly eat stale bread. Congressmen said that we found that complete new clothes or new coats are luxuries for adults. Most clothes are bought on credit or are second-hand. Many families rely entirely on relatives and charities for clothing. The housing shortage since the end of World War II has made life even more difficult for low-income families, a life that is unbearable to those of us who have seen it firsthand. In the post-war years, these families have difficulty even moving into slums. We are still arguing about the housing shortage in towns, state capitals, and the national capital, and countless children are growing up in squalor. This investigation reveals that health is 'the weakest point.' When disease strikes, low-income families are truly helpless. Our safeguards against disease affecting health and livelihood remain pitifully inadequate.'"

However, in the eyes of the bourgeois politicians of the United States, it seems that it is not the sinful capitalist system that should be held responsible for the tragic lives of the vast majority of the American people, but rather these people's own inability to compete for survival. This tragic phenomenon is not an indication of the decay of the American economic system, but a matter of course. The Joint Committee on the Economic Report even said in its report: "To us, their struggles and makeshift solutions, their ingenuity and talent, as well as their failures and unwise choices, are part of the fabric of American life."

### 美统治集团疯狂侵略和备战  美国人民生活贫困  一千万个家庭挣扎在饥饿线上

　　美统治集团疯狂侵略和备战
    美国人民生活贫困
    一千万个家庭挣扎在饥饿线上
    【新华社二十六日讯】华盛顿讯：美国统治集团的侵略和备战政策促使国内生活费用日益高涨的情况下，美国人民正被迫挣扎在饥饿线上。美国国会经济报告联合委员会于十八日发表报告，供认目前美国有一千万个家庭的收入只能够勉强维持活命。
    经济报告联合委员会在调查了一百个有代表性的每年收入在二千美元以下的家庭后承认：这些家庭的情况所说明的是“可怜的工作，可怜的健康情况，可怜的住所，恶劣的食物，无法获得教育和技能”。报告中所列举的例子之一说明，在罗得岛普罗维顿斯，有一个卡车司机靠一年一千九百二十四美元的收入竟要养活妻子和十个孩子。
    低微的收入迫使这些家庭不得不勒紧腰带来过日子。据合众社称：“委员会的报告说：‘削减食物的最常用的方法是除婴儿外都不吃肉和牛奶。也就是说，只吃面包、马铃薯、通心粉、面条、大米所配成的素食。’为了要减少开支，人们普遍食用陈面包。国会议员说，我们发现，成套的新衣或新大衣对成年人来说乃是珍品。大多数衣服都是用赊账办法买来的，要不然就是买的旧货。有许多家庭完全依靠亲戚和慈善团体施舍衣服。第二次世界大战结束以来的房荒使收入低微的家庭的生活更加艰难，这种生活对我们亲眼看到过的人说来，正是不堪入目。在战后的年代中，这些家庭甚至搬进贫民窟去住也有困难。我们在城镇、州会、首都仍为房荒而争吵，无数的孩子们在污秽中长大。这次调查透露，健康是‘最弱的一点’。当疾病侵袭的时候，收入低微的家庭真是束手无策。我们防止疾病侵害健康与生计的保障仍然是缺乏得可怜。”
    但是，在美国资产阶级的政客们看来，应当对广大的美国人民这种悲惨生活负责的似乎不是罪恶的资本主义制度，而只是这些人民自己不善作生存竞争，这种悲惨的现象不是美国经济制度腐朽的表示，而是理所当然的事情。经济报告联合委员会竟然在报告里说：“对我们说来，他们的斗争与弥缝的办法，他们的机智与才能，以及他们的失败和不智的选择，是美国生活经纬的一部分”。
