　　Circular of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government
    The Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan is Changed to September 3rd
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th] The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the following circular to designate September 3rd as the Victory Commemoration Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan:
    "In the Measures for Uniform National Festivals and Holidays promulgated by this Council on December 23, 1949, August 15 was designated as the Victory Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan. It is found that Japan formally surrendered after the Japanese government signed the surrender treaty on September 2, 1945. Therefore, the Victory Commemoration Day of the War of Resistance Against Japan should be changed to September 3rd. Every year on September 3rd, the people of the whole country should commemorate the glorious history of our military and civilians winning the victory against Japan after the great eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the assistance of the Soviet army in liberating Northeast China. September 3rd is not a holiday.
                                      Premier Zhou Enlai
                                          August 13, 1951."

　　中央人民政府政务院通告
    抗日战争胜利日改定为九月三日
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府政务院为规定九月三日为抗日战争胜利纪念日，发出通告如下：
    “本院在一九四九年十二月二十三日所公布的统一全国年节和纪念日放假办法中，曾以八月十五日为抗日战争胜利日。查日本实行投降，系在一九四五年九月二日日本政府签字于投降条约以后。故抗日战争胜利纪念日应改定为九月三日。每年九月三日，全国人民应对我国军民经过伟大的八年抗日战争和苏军出兵解放东北的援助而取得对日胜利的光荣历史举行纪念。九月三日不放假。
                                      总理  周恩来
                                          一九五一年八月十三日。”
