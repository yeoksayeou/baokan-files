Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 14th: According to TASS, on August 12th, two million German youth held a demonstration and rally in Berlin for German Youth Peace Fighters' Day, opposing the rearmament of West Germany and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951. 1.5 million youth from the German Democratic Republic, 35,000 youth from West Germany, and over 10,000 youth from West Berlin participated in the demonstration. They marched in formation past the reviewing stand on Marx-Engels Square, where they were reviewed by President Pieck. In addition, 500,000 young men and women stood along the parade routes. Youth representatives from various countries participating in the World Youth and Student Festival for Peace also attended the rally.

　　From 5:00 AM, the youth peace fighters began gathering in various streets, and by 7:00 AM, they had all assembled in Marx-Engels Square. At 8:00 AM sharp, President Pieck, Premier Grotewohl, Deputy Premier Ulbricht, and other leaders of the government of the German Democratic Republic, along with World Federation of Democratic Youth President Billinguer, International Union of Students President Grohman, Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union Mikhailov, Free German Youth League Chairman Honnecker, Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission General Chuikov, Deputy Chairman Semichastnov, Head of the Soviet Diplomatic Mission to the German Democratic Republic Pushkin, Chairman of the German Communist Party Lehmann, and personnel from various foreign diplomatic missions, stepped onto the reviewing stand amidst cheers from the entire crowd.

　　The celebration ceremony then began. Colorful daytime fireworks appeared in the sky above the venue. After a series of explosions, countless small parachutes carrying the white flags of the Third World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and the national flags of various countries slowly descended from the sky. At the same time, thousands of peace doves were released over the square, flying for a long time above the square. Then, the band played a march, and the demonstration began.

　　Leading the parade was the Young Pioneers, carrying flowers. As they passed the reviewing stand, a group of Young Pioneers ran onto the central reviewing stand to present flowers to President Pieck as a tribute. Following them was a youth contingent carrying a giant statue of Stalin. The parade was led by a large contingent of flag bearers, carrying the flags of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, the People's Republic of China, and various other countries. Behind the flag bearers was the contingent of the Free German Youth League, carrying blue flags. German youth, holding signs reading "Not a single German youth for Adenauer's mercenaries! Not a single penny for remilitarization! Down with the Bonn warmongers!" marched past the reviewing stand, where foreign guests on the reviewing stand cheered enthusiastically for them. German youth do not want war, and this demonstration is clear proof of that.

　　Following them was the contingent of German youth athletes, marching with signs reading "Prepare for labor and defense of peace!" Each contingent carried the flag of its respective sports association. One contingent carried a portrait of Thälmann and a long banner with the words "Be as passionate and patriotic as Thälmann!" The name of this great proletarian leader is inspiring German youth to engage in heroic struggle.

　　Further behind was the contingent of 35,000 West German youth. These excellent young peace fighters overcame numerous difficulties created by the West German police on their way to Berlin. They are not afraid of the persecution of the American occupiers and Adenauer. Among their ranks were the young peace fighters who had bravely landed on Helgoland Island, which was used by the British Air Force as a bombing practice target, and raised the German flag on the island; youth representatives of farmers from the Main River region, protesting the transformation of their fields into American shooting ranges; and youth representatives of miners from the Ruhr region, whose banners read: "Germany must be united!" They shouted: "We will not allow the Ruhr to be sold to Wall Street! Down with the Schuman Plan!" A large group of young experts from the "Eagle Society," a youth group of the West German Social Democratic Party, marched at the end of the West German youth contingent, protesting the policies of the right-wing Social Democrats, demanding an end to the rearmament of West Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951.

　　The demonstration lasted for eight hours and then concluded. This demonstration once again demonstrated the firm will of German youth to fight for peace, international friendship, and the establishment of a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany.

　　柏林举行德国青年和平战士日
    二百万德国青年集会示威游行   
    反对重新武装西德·要求在今年内缔结对德和约
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社柏林十三日讯：八月十二日，两百万德国青年在柏林举行了德国青年和平战士日的示威游行大会，反对重新武装西德，并要求在一九五一年缔结对德和约。德意志民主共和国青年一百五十万人及来自西德的青年三万五千人与来自西柏林的青年一万多人，参加了示威游行，他们列队走过马克思、恩格斯广场的检阅台受皮克总统的检阅。另外，还有五十万青年男女一直伫立在游行街道的两旁。参加世界青年与学生和平联欢节的各国青年代表都参加了这次大会。
    从早晨五时起，青年和平战士们便开始在各街道集合，到七点钟时，已全部聚集到马克思、恩格斯广场上。八时正，以皮克总统、格罗提渥总理、乌布利希副总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府各首长、及世界民主青年联盟主席比林格尔、国际学生联合会主席格罗曼、苏联共产主义青年团中央委员会书记米哈依洛夫、自由德国青年联盟主席昂纳克、苏联管制委员会主席崔可夫将军、副主席塞米查斯特诺夫、苏联驻德意志民主共和国外交使团团长普式金、德国共产党主席雷曼及各国外交使团人员等在全场欢呼声中步上了检阅台。
    庆祝仪式随即开始。会场上空出现了五色缤纷的白昼焰火，在连续的爆炸声后，无数小降落伞系着第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的白色旗帜和各国的国旗自空中徐徐下降。同时，广场上放起了几千只和平鸽子，在广场上空飞翔很久。接着，乐队奏起了进行曲，示威游行于是开始。
    走在队伍最前列的是带着鲜花的少年先锋队，他们走过检阅台前面的时候，一群少年先锋队队员跑上中央检阅台向皮克总统献花致敬。跟着就是举着斯大林巨像的青年队伍。游行队伍由一大队的旗手领头，他们举着苏联、德意志民主共和国、中华人民共和国和各国的国旗前进。旗手队后面是举着蓝旗的自由德国青年联盟的队伍。德国青年高举着“不给阿登纳的雇佣军出一个德国青年！不为重新军国主义化出一个钱！打倒波恩战争贩子！”的标语行经检阅台前，检阅台的外国来宾都为他们热烈的欢呼。德国青年不要战争，这次示威就是明显的证明。
    紧跟在后面的是德国青年运动员的行列，他们高举着“为劳动与保卫和平而准备着！”的标语行进。每个队伍都举着他们自己的体育协会的旗帜。其中一队高举着台尔曼的画像和长幅标语，标语上面写着“要像台尔曼那样热情和爱国！”这个伟大的无产阶级领袖的名字正鼓舞着德国青年进行英勇的斗争。
    再后面是三万五千西德青年的队伍，这些优秀的青年和平战士们在来到柏林的途中曾经克服了西德警察所造成的层层困难，他们并不害怕美国占领者和阿登纳的迫害。在他们的队伍中间，有曾经英勇地在被英国空军用作轰炸练习目标的黑尔郭兰岛上登陆，并在岛上高悬起德国国旗的青年和平战士们；有美因河流域的青年农民代表，他们抗议把他们的田地变为美国打靶场；有鲁尔区的青年矿工代表，他们的标语上写道：“德国必须统一！”他们高呼着：“我们不准把鲁尔卖给华尔街，打倒舒曼计划！”西德社会民主党的青年团体“鹰会”的大批青年专家走在西德青年队伍的最后面，他们抗议右翼社会民主党的政策，要求停止重新武装西德和在一九五一年缔结对德和约。
    示威游行共历时八小时而结束。这次的示威再度表明了德国青年为和平与国际友好及争取建立统一、和平与民主的德国而斗争的坚定意志。
