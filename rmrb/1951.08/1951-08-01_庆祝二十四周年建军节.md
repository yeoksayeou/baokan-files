　　Celebrating the Twenty-Fourth Anniversary of the Founding of the Army
    Li Jishen
    We warmly celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China on "July 1st;" today, we are also warmly celebrating the twenty-fourth anniversary of the founding of the heroic, strong, and invincible Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    The history of the Chinese Communist Party over the past thirty years is the history of leading the Chinese people in carrying out the new democratic revolution, that is, the history of leading the Chinese people to organize people's armed forces to carry out revolutionary struggles. The Chinese Communist Party, since today twenty-four years ago, has been inseparable from the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army—the People's Liberation Army; that is to say, the Chinese people's revolution over the past twenty-four years has been inseparable from the heroic struggle of the Chinese people's armed forces. The law of the development of Chinese social history determines that the Chinese revolution must be, and can only be, armed people opposing armed counter-revolution. Without the establishment, growth, and development of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, it would have been absolutely impossible to achieve the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution today.

    During the First Domestic Revolutionary War from 1924 to 1927, including the Northern Expedition, the Chinese Communist Party directly controlled a portion of the revolutionary army; but at that time, it did not pay enough attention to organizing people's armed forces, which led to setbacks. However, since the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising in 1927 to the joining of forces at Jinggangshan, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, established their own armed forces, and gradually grew and developed with the revolutionary situation, only then did they achieve the great victory of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War. Therefore, the establishment, growth, and development of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is inseparable from Chairman Mao's correct leadership. Without Chairman Mao's leadership, it would have been impossible to achieve the great achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army today.

    The Chinese people's armed forces have not only defeated and eliminated the forces of the three major enemies—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism—in the past twenty-four years, but are also now consolidating and defending the political power established by the Chinese people themselves; severely suppressing domestic counter-revolution, and justly resisting the aggression of American imperialism against the fraternal neighboring country of Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers in the movement to resist America and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend the country are just as heroic as the Chinese People's Liberation Army, shouldering the responsibility of resisting violence and defending our homeland. Without the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the People's Public Security Forces, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, it would be impossible to maintain the fruits of the Chinese people's revolutionary victory, thereby carrying out new democratic economic construction.

    Therefore, today, as we celebrate the twenty-fourth anniversary of the founding of the army, we should first pay tribute to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the People's Public Security Forces, and the Chinese People's Volunteers! Pay tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, who organized and led the Chinese people's armed forces! Pay tribute to General Peng Dehuai, who commands the Chinese People's Volunteers in heroic battles in Korea! At the same time, express our condolences and remembrance to the martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves in the People's Liberation Army for twenty-four years and in the People's Volunteers for nine months! Express our sincere condolences to the honored soldiers and sick and wounded comrades of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Volunteers!

    As mentioned earlier, the Chinese people and the Chinese people's armed forces are inextricably linked. Without the Chinese people's armed forces, the Chinese people would have nothing. The Chinese people's Army Day is also the day when the Chinese people began to stand up. Today, as we celebrate Army Day, we are also celebrating our emancipation. The Chinese people, relying on their own armed forces, overthrew the three mountains on their backs, gained freedom and stability today, and a bright and happy future. The joy and excitement we feel on this great day of emancipation cannot be described in words.

    We should not only celebrate this festival with joy and excitement, but also with serious and practical actions. The more than 330,000 young men and women who have signed up to participate in military cadre schools across the country are a manifestation of celebrating Army Day. The donation of 2,253 airplanes, 130 artillery pieces, and other weapons is also a manifestation of celebrating Army Day. Other widely developed movements of preferential treatment for the wounded and sick soldiers, honored soldiers, and families of martyrs and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Volunteers, the implementation of patriotic production plans, and various patriotic conventions for doing a good job are all positive manifestations of celebrating Army Day. In short, we should show how to strengthen national defense construction, how to increase production, do a good job, support the front lines, and how to give preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers in everyone's specific actions, which is truly a serious and practical celebration of the twenty-fourth anniversary of the great and glorious Army Day!

    We shout:
    Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
    Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!
    Long live the great victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war!
    Long live peace in all of Asia and the world!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

### 庆祝二十四周年建军节

　　庆祝二十四周年建军节
    李济深
    我们在“七一”热烈庆祝了伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党建党的三十周年；今天又来热烈庆祝英勇、坚强、所向无敌的中国人民解放军的二十四周年建军节。
    三十年来中国共产党的历史是领导中国人民进行新民主主义革命的历史，也就是领导中国人民组织人民武装进行革命斗争的历史。中国共产党自二十四年前的今天起和中国工农红军——人民解放军是分不开的；也就是说中国人民革命二十四年来和中国人民武装的英勇斗争是分不开的。中国社会历史发展的规律决定了中国革命必须是而且只能是武装的人民反对武装的反革命。没有中国人民解放军的建立，壮大和发展就绝对不可能取得今天中国人民革命的伟大胜利。
    中国共产党在一九二四年至二七年包括北伐战争的第一次国内革命战争时期，曾直接掌握了一部分革命军队；但那时对于组织人民武力还不够重视，以致遭遇了挫折。可是自从一九二七年“八一”南昌起义到井冈山会师，中国人民就在中国共产党领导下，毛主席和朱总司令领导下建立了自己的武装，并随着革命形势逐渐壮大和发展，才取得了第二次国内革命战争，抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争的伟大胜利。所以中国人民解放军的建立、壮大和发展是与毛主席的正确领导分不开的。没有毛主席的领导就也不可能获得中国人民解放军今日的伟大成就。
    中国人民的武装不但在二十四年中打败和消灭了帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义三大敌人的势力，而且现正巩固和保卫着中国人民自己建立的政权；严厉地镇压了国内的反革命，正义地抵抗着美帝国主义向朝鲜兄弟邻邦进行的侵略。抗美援朝保家卫国运动中的中国人民志愿军正和中国人民解放军一样地英勇，担负起抵抗强暴保卫家邦的责任。没有中国人民解放军、人民公安部队、和中国人民志愿军就不可能保持中国人民革命胜利的果实，从而进行新民主主义的经济建设。
    所以我们今天庆祝二十四周年的建军节，首先应当向中国人民解放军人民公安部队和中国人民志愿军致敬！向组织领导中国人民武装的毛主席朱总司令致敬！向指挥中国人民志愿军在朝鲜英勇作战的彭德怀将军致敬！同时向二十四年来的人民解放军，九个月来的人民志愿军英勇牺牲的烈士们表示哀悼的怀念！向人民解放军人民志愿军的荣誉军人和伤病员同志们表示亲切的慰问！
    如前所说，中国人民和中国人民的武装是血肉相连不可分的。没有中国人民的武装便没有了中国人民的一切。中国人民的建军节，也就是中国人民开始翻身的节日。今天我们庆祝建军节，也正庆祝了我们的翻身。中国人民仗着自己的武装推翻了身上的三重大山获得自由安定的今日和美满幸福的将来，我们在这个伟大翻身的节日具有如何欢欣鼓舞的心情，那真不是言语所可形容的。
    我们不仅以欢欣鼓舞的心情庆祝这个节日，更应以认真切实的行动庆祝这个节日。报名参加各地军事干部学校的三十三万多男女青年正是庆祝建军节的行动表现。二千二百五十三架飞机一百三十门大炮等武器的捐献也是庆祝建军节的行动表现。其他普遍发展的对于人民解放军志愿军伤病员和荣誉军人以及烈属军属的各种优抚运动，贯彻执行的爱国主义生产计划，和各种搞好工作的爱国公约也都是庆祝建军节的积极表现。总之，我们应当如何加强国防建设，如何增加生产，搞好工作，支援前线，如何优抚烈属军属，表现在每个人的具体行动上，才真是认真切实的庆祝二十四周年伟大光荣的建军节！
    我们高呼：
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中国人民革命战争伟大胜利万岁！
    全亚洲全世界的和平万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
