Oppose Waste of Timber, Oppose Reckless Deforestation!

　　Pangjiabu Mine, affiliated with the Longyan Iron Mine in Xuanhua City, Chahar Province, experienced waste in its civil engineering construction last year due to the engineering technicians' failure to conduct thorough investigation and research and their unwillingness to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. This resulted in a waste of over 1.216 billion yuan.

　　Many of the mine's houses were built on the ruins of structures from the Japanese occupation period. The foundations of these buildings were shoddily constructed at the time and were very unstable. However, the mine's leading cadres failed to study this situation and blindly decided to restore and rebuild on the original foundations. Shortly after a certain warehouse was built, it was discovered that the walls were skewed, and the gable and front walls had cracks more than an inch wide. The entire gable and part of the front wall had to be demolished and rebuilt with new pilings to temporarily solve the problem of unstable foundations. The second dormitory of Pangjiabu Mine was too close to the retaining slope, and its durability would only reach about 60% of its expected lifespan.

　　The mine had 1.2 million unfired bricks left over from the Japanese occupation period (stored for at least five years by last year). Although these bricks appeared intact on the surface, they had long lost their binding properties. The mine leadership, in an effort to "save money," decided to fire these bricks without careful research or humbly listening to the opinions of the masses. As a result, most of the bricks were fired into "powder bricks." According to the mine's estimate, more than 720,000 bricks were lost. The quality of the "fired bricks" was also extremely poor.

　　When planning to build 500 earth cave dwellings, a rough estimate was used instead of a proper construction design. There were significant errors in the estimation of soil conditions, cave angles, and distances. Furthermore, the local climate conditions were not considered during construction, and no flood prevention measures were taken. As a result, many of the caves collapsed as soon as they were dug. The collapse of individual new caves resulted in the death and injury of workers. Now, although 86% of the planned caves have been completed, only 25 have been used as warehouses, while the rest have been destroyed or closed off. This single project resulted in a waste equivalent to 350,000 catties of millet.

　　The main reasons for these serious errors were the blindness of the leading cadres and the lack of responsibility of the technical personnel. Liu Yi, the deputy director of the mine's construction committee, said, "I worked blindly for a year and became confused!" Some engineers also said, "We just took a cursory glance at the site; there was no real investigation or research."

　　The lack of accountability in the mine's civil engineering construction process was also a fundamental cause of the waste. There was a serious lack of accountability in engineering design, finished product inspection, and material storage. For example, no one was responsible for the engineering design of the earth caves before construction; during construction, the entire project was contracted out to local farmers. Initially, there was no fixed supervisor, which led to a focus on quantity rather than quality. In May of last year, 16.9 tons of lime were washed away in one incident. Due to the lack of flood prevention channels and substandard foundations, the foundations of some of the mine's projects were washed away by rainwater, resulting in serious rework and waste. Although collapses occurred repeatedly, they did not attract the attention of the mine's leading cadres, leading to serious consequences.

### 庞家堡矿场土木建筑接连发生了许多浪费

　　庞家堡矿场土木建筑接连发生了许多浪费
    察哈尔省宣化市龙烟铁矿所属庞家堡矿场，去年的土木建筑，由于工程技术人员没有认真进行调查研究，又未能虚心倾听群众意见，盲目修建，浪费达十二亿一千六百三十四万余元。
    该矿许多房屋是在日寇统治时期所建筑的房屋的废墟上修建的。这些房屋的地基在当年建筑时偷工减料，都很不坚固。但该矿领导干部对这一情况却一直未加研究，盲目地决定在原有基础上进行恢复和建设。某仓库盖好不久，便发现墙壁歪斜，山墙和前墙裂了一寸多宽的缝。只得把全部山墙和部分前墙拆毁，重新打桩建筑，才算暂时解决了地基不稳的毛病。庞家堡第二宿舍离护坡的距离过近，耐久年限最多仅能达到预计使用年限的十分之六。
    矿场里存有日寇统治时期打的一百二十万块砖坯（到去年最少已存了五年），这些砖坯从表面看虽还完好无缺，但早已失去了粘结性。该矿领导上为了“省钱”，既未认真研究，也没有虚心听取群众的意见，冒然地决定烧这些坯。结果大部分砖坯被烧成“粉砖”。据该矿估计：共损失七十二万多块砖。已烧成的“块砖”，质量也极坏。
    当计划修建五百间土窑洞时，用轮廓的估计，代替了施工设计。对于土质情况、土窑角度、距离等的估计上都有极大的错误；修建时，又未注意当地气候的情况，未作防洪设备。因此，许多土窑刚刚挖好就塌毁了。个别新建土窑的塌毁，曾经砸死和砸伤过工人。现在按原计划窑洞已完成百分之八十六，但仅有二十五个土窑被用作仓库，其余都被毁坏或封闭。仅这一项工程浪费，即达三十五万斤小米。
    发生这些严重错误的主要原因是领导干部的盲目性和技术人员对工作未认真负责。该矿建筑委员会副主任刘毅曾说：“作了一年的闷头工作，把我都弄糊涂了！”有的工程师也说：“到现场走马观花似的，说不上什么调查研究。”
    该矿土木建筑过程中的无人负责的现象，也是造成浪费的基本原因之一。工程设计、成品检验和材料保管上都有严重的无人负责的现象。例如修建土窑时，事前无人负责工程设计；施工时工程整批地包给当地农民做。开始时没有一个固定的监工人员，因此，就发生了单纯追求数量，而不注意质量的现象。去年五月间，一次冲走白灰十六点九吨。由于没有防洪水道设备和地基不合规格，该矿部分工程地基，曾被雨水冲毁，又造成严重的返工浪费现象。塌毁现象虽然连续发生，但并未引起该矿领导干部的高度重视，以致造成严重恶果。
