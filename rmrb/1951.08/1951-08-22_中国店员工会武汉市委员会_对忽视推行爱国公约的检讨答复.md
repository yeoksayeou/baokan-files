　　Chinese Store Employees' Union Wuhan Municipal Committee
    Reply to Self-Criticism Regarding Neglecting the Promotion of Patriotic Pacts
    To the Editor:
    The reader's letter from Comrade Hong Shichang published on the readers' letters page of the People's Daily on August 8th criticized our committee's leadership for not paying enough attention to the widespread promotion of patriotic pacts (note: this criticism has been published in the Wuhan Dagang Daily and the Beijing Workers' Daily). We believe this criticism is very good and should be accepted. Subjectively speaking, we were not clear enough about the specific methods of drafting patriotic pacts and did not study them in depth, which shows that we did not pay enough attention to this great work. However, the situation at the time was that our organization was carrying out the Honest and Sincere Movement, and we were also busy participating in the Second Wuhan Municipal People's Congress and preparing for the Second Congress of our own organization. Therefore, we did not combine the various tasks well. Not only did we not do a good job in promoting patriotic pacts, but we also did not conduct in-depth inspections of increasing production donations and production competitions.
    Regarding this issue, we have conducted a self-criticism in conjunction with the overall work at the Second Congress of our organization. At this congress, we have listed the work of resisting America and aiding Korea as the most important task of our organization and have conducted key in-depth supervision and inspection at the grassroots level.

　　中国店员工会武汉市委员会
    对忽视推行爱国公约的检讨答复
    编辑同志：
    人民日报八月八日读者来信专页刊出了洪世昌同志对我会领导上不重视普遍推行爱国公约的批评（按这项批评曾在武汉大刚报、北京工人日报发表过），我们认为这个批评很好，应当接受。从主观上来说，我们对订立爱国公约的具体办法是不够明确的，也未深入加以研究，这说明了我们对这一伟大的工作重视不够。但当时情况是：我们机关正开展了忠诚老实运动，同时又忙于参加武汉市第二届各界人民代表会，和准备召开本会的第二届代表大会，因此没有很好把各种工作结合起来，不仅是推行爱国公约没有做好，而且连增产捐献和生产竞赛也都没有深入检查。
    关于这个问题，在本会第二届代表大会上，我们已结合整个工作进行了检讨。在这次代表会上，我们已把抗美援朝工作列为本会的第一等重要任务，并有重点地深入下层进行了督促检查。
