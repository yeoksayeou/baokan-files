Correct the Deviation of Neglecting Democratic Regime Construction!
    Many cities and counties in Hebei Province regard convening people's representative conferences as a task assigned by higher authorities.
    Over the past year or so, counties and cities in Hebei Province have generally convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life. At these conferences, counties and cities, to varying degrees, promoted the spirit of democratic consultation, educated the representatives in patriotism, and enhanced their political awareness. As a result, these conferences greatly promoted major tasks in the province such as the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and the patriotic production increase movement. However, many cadres in the people's governments of counties and cities still do not correctly understand the significance and role of people's representative conferences from all walks of life, and still regard convening such conferences as a "task" assigned by higher authorities, turning the people's representative conferences into cadre meetings. Consequently, the democratic regime construction work in the province still suffers from the following shortcomings:
    First, the people's representative conference has not formed a regular system. From January to June this year, 118 counties, cities, towns, and mining areas in the province convened people's representative conferences or people's congresses. Among them, one county convened three times, four cities, sixty-three counties, four towns, and one mining area convened twice, and forty-five counties convened once. However, there are still twenty-three counties that have not convened a people's representative conference from all walks of life in half a year. The people's government committees and administrative meetings of most counties, cities, and towns in the province are also not convened as stipulated. Many cadres have an unclear understanding of the nature and role of the standing committees of the people's representative conferences, and therefore do not attach enough importance to them, failing to establish a regular working system, rendering them virtually non-existent. For example, Lishui and Cixian have never convened a meeting of the standing committee since its establishment in 1949. Guangping County has only held one meeting of the standing committee. Qingyuan and Huolu abolished the standing committee in effect after the people's representative conference was convened last spring. Mancheng County even merged the standing committee with the county people's government committee. In addition, in some counties, the representatives were not re-elected or replaced in a timely manner due to the expiration of their terms, transfer of work, dereliction of duty, or long-term absence.
    Second, the transmission of conference resolutions and the handling of proposals are generally not taken seriously, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of proposals at the people's representative conferences of counties, cities, and towns. Generally, there used to be 300 to 500 proposals, but now the maximum is no more than 100. In a few places such as Xianxian and Huolu, there are only more than 20 proposals, which has caused the masses to lack confidence in solving their own problems. Most counties have a large number of conference documents, and most of the farmer representatives are illiterate. The county leadership has not provided timely assistance, so many resolutions have not been transmitted. For example, after the fifth session of the first people's representative conference in Mancheng County, about half of the villages did not receive the transmission. The representatives' request to dig a spring and open a canal in Baoyang Mountain was not given due attention. The reply from the county's leading cadres was: "We will ask the higher authorities for instructions before resolving it." However, after the meeting, they neither asked the higher authorities for instructions nor explained it to the representatives, who believed that "it's useless to say anything."
    Third, the election of representatives in individual places is not serious and prudent enough, and the turnover of representatives is too large. For example, at the first session of the second people's representative conference in Jiaohe County, only 52 out of 254 representatives were re-elected, and the turnover of representatives accounted for more than 79% of the original number. The turnover of representatives in Cangxian also reached more than 40%.
    People's representative conference in Yanggao County, Chahar Province, becomes an organ only for assigning tasks.
    From November 1949 to June this year, Yanggao County, Chahar Province, convened a total of seven county people's representative conferences. Each conference was closely linked to the current situation and central tasks, and achieved certain results. However, the democratic regime construction work in the county still has many shortcomings. The most fundamental one is that each time the people's representative conference is convened, attention is not paid to strengthening regime construction, but is simply aimed at completing a certain central task. As a result of this approach, the people's representatives feel that "the people's representative conference only plays the role of a bridge," and that the representative conference only assigns tasks, without regarding it as an organ for the people to exercise state power. The county's leading cadres also have the idea that "the people's representative conference is no longer fresh."
    This one-sided task-oriented view of the people's representative conference in the county is clearly reflected in the following issues:
    First, the election of representatives has not undergone sufficient publicity and deliberation, and there are phenomena of paternalism, substitution, carelessness, and perfunctoriness. The list of representative candidates is not deliberated and discussed by the masses, but is generally determined by the cadres, and then nominated and voted on at the electorate meeting. In some villages, the candidates are even decided by the village cadres after consultation, and then reported to the district government for approval to become representatives. For example, Yang Zixin, the representative of Liguantun, was elected in this way. Until now, the villagers do not know that he is a representative, but only know that he is a cadre. After the representative of Caozhuang in the tenth district was elected, he did not attend the meeting, and the village cadres designated another person to be the representative. Representatives elected in this way naturally cannot fully play their role, and generally believe that they are only persons appointed by the "superior" government to transmit work tasks, without the consciousness of being masters of their own affairs. In addition, the democratic spirit is not fully promoted at each meeting, and the representatives' opinions are not given due respect, so many representatives have concerns. For example, the representative of Liguantun said: "We dare not raise our opinions even if we have them, because it is useless to raise them." Some representatives said: "If you raise your opinion, the cadres will not listen, and they will remember you." Some are so depressed that they say: "I have been a representative for a long time, shouldn't I be replaced?" The number of absentees at each meeting is considerable. Except for the first meeting, where the attendance was about 94% of the total number of representatives, the attendance at the fourth meeting was only 61.4%, and the absentees at other meetings were around 20%. Although the representatives have changed greatly in the past two years, some have been transferred to other jobs, some have died, some have been disqualified as representatives for violating laws and dereliction of duty, and some have not attended the meetings at all, the county has not re-elected or replaced them in a timely manner.
    Second, the handling of proposals was more serious in the early days of regime construction, but it has become less and less valued later on. At the first people's representative conference, there were more than 130 proposals, and at the second conference, there were more than 60 proposals. The conference specially established a "Proposal Review and Handling Committee" to be responsible for collecting, sorting out, and handling them separately. Some were handed over to relevant departments for research and handling on the spot, some were submitted to higher authorities for instructions before a decision was made, and some were explained. Although the handling was not good enough, the representatives were satisfied with this serious and responsible attitude. In particular, at the second meeting, the district chief of the second district who destroyed the forest and beat and scolded the village cadres was removed from his post after accepting the criticism from the representatives, which greatly enlightened the representatives' sense of ownership. However, since the third meeting, the county has only paid attention to how to deploy and implement the central tasks. The agenda of the meeting is very tight, and the representatives do not even have time to submit proposals. Even the "Proposal Review and Handling Committee" has been abolished in effect. Since then, no representative has submitted any proposals. And the representatives have become less and less interested in the county people's representative conference.
    Third, the standing committee is not valued, and the spirit of democratic consultation has not been fully promoted. The county established a standing committee when the first people's representative conference was convened, and it was originally scheduled to meet once a month, but it has never been implemented. Except for two standing committee meetings held between the first and second meetings, and between the second and third meetings, the rest were only held temporarily before the people's representative conference was about to be convened to discuss the work report drafted by the government. Because the standing committee members were not given enough time to study the content of the work report in advance, they rarely reflected the voices of the masses, but only passed the government's draft plan. The standing committee members were very dissatisfied with this approach. Some said: "The county government holds meetings whenever it wants to, and doesn't hold meetings whenever it doesn't want to." Some standing committee members never went to meetings again after attending the first meeting. Although the county added two full-time resident members to the standing committee at the end of last year, they had nothing to do, had little contact with the representatives, and never attended the administrative meetings of the county people's government. The standing committee has never reported its work to the people's representative conference from all walks of life, and the resident members have not reported their work to the standing committee. The two full-time cadres also exist in name only.
    Fourth, a passive attitude is adopted towards the exercise of the functions and powers of the people's congress by the people's representative conference, and decisions are made but not implemented. At the first people's representative conference, it was proposed to "convene a county-wide general election of the people's congress." At the second people's representative conference, the deputy county magistrate of the county explained: "At present, it is the spring plowing season. In order to avoid delaying the farming season as much as possible, it will be changed to the slack farming season for the election." At this meeting and the fourth meeting, the same resolution was made to exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress. Not only was it not realized later, but it was never explained to the representatives. The county's leading departments raised this issue three times, but they were not serious and prudent enough, because they had no sincerity in wanting it to "exercise" the functions and powers of the people's congress at all. According to Deputy County Magistrate Ma, the intention of making such a resolution at the meeting was only to delay and cope with the situation. This "decision but no action" approach in the county has left a bad impression on the representatives and the masses, and has damaged the prestige of the people's representative conference and the government.
    The creation of these phenomena has some objective difficulties, such as many work tasks, one pressing on top of another, and the quality of cadres is poor, so it is easy to regard the people's representative conference from all walks of life as a conference for deploying work. However, the most fundamental reason is that the leading cadres do not pay attention to the system of people's representative conferences, and regard it as opposed to other work. They have never included democratic regime construction work on the agenda for discussion, on the grounds that there is no time to do it, and even think that it does not matter if it is not done well. This erroneous thinking has seriously weakened the democratic regime construction work in the county, and has affected the promotion of other work.

　　纠正忽视民主政权建设工作的偏向！
    河北省许多市县把召开人民代表会议当成上级交的任务
    河北省在这一年多以来，各县、市已普遍召开了各界人民代表会议。在这些会议上，各县、市都程度不等地发扬了民主协商的精神，向代表进行了爱国主义教育，提高了代表的政治觉悟，因而对于全省的抗美援朝运动、镇压反革命运动和爱国丰产运动等项重大工作起了很大的推动作用。但许多县、市人民政府的干部至今还没有正确地认识到各界人民代表会议的意义和作用，仍然把召开会议当成上级交下来的“任务”，人民代表会议开成了干部会议，因而在该省的民主建政工作还存在着下面几个缺点：
    第一、人民代表会议没有形成经常的制度。从今年一月到六月，该省召开各界人民代表会议或人民代表大会者有一百一十八个县、市、镇和矿区，其中召开三次的一个县，两次的四个市、六十三个县、四个镇和一个矿区，一次的四十五个县。但仍有二十三个县半年未召开过一次各界人民代表会议。该省大部分县、市、镇人民政府委员会和行政会议也不按照规定召开。许多干部对于各界人民代表会议常务委员会的性质和作用也认识不清，因而重视不够，没有建立经常的工作制度，形同虚设。如涞水、磁县自一九四九年建立常务委员会以来，始终没有召开过一次会议。广平县只开过一次常务委员会议。清苑和获鹿自去年春季召开人民代表会议后，常务委员会无形中就取消了。满城县更把常务委员会和县人民政府委员会混合为一。此外有些县的代表因任期期满、调动工作、失职或长期外出，也没有及时进行改选和补选。
    第二、对于会议决议的传达、提案的处理，一般是很不认真，以致各县、市、镇各界人民代表会议的提案已显著减少，一般的原来多是三百件至五百件，现最多不超过一百件，献县和获鹿等少数地方只有二十多件，引起群众对于解决自己的问题缺乏信心。大多数县的会议文件甚多，而农民代表多不识字，县的领导上也没有及时帮助，因此很多决议没有传达下去。如满城县一届五次各界人民代表会议后，约有半数村没有传达。代表提出要求在抱阳山凿泉开渠的意见，也没有受到应有的重视，该县领导干部的答复是：“待请示上级再为解决。”但会后既未请示上级，又不向代表说明，代表认为“说了也不顶事”。
    第三、个别地方的代表选举不够严肃慎重，代表的变动太大。如交河县的二届一次各界人民代表会议，二百五十四名代表中连选连任的只有五十二名，变动的代表占原数的百分之七十九多，沧县代表的变动也达百分之四十以上。
    察哈尔省阳高县人民代表会议成为只是布置任务的机关
    从一九四九年十一月到今年六月，察哈尔省阳高县共召开了七次县各界人民代表会议。每一次会议都密切地联系着当前的形势与中心工作，获得了一定的成绩。但该县的民主政权建设工作还存在着不少缺点，最基本的是每次各界人民代表会议的召开，不注意加强政权建设，只是单纯地为了完成某项中心工作。这种作法的结果，使人民代表感到“人民代表会议只起桥梁作用”，代表会只是布置任务，没有把它看成人民行使国家政权的机关。该县的领导干部也有“代表会议不新鲜了”的思想。
    该县此种对人民代表会议的片面任务观点，鲜明地表现在下面几个问题上：
    第一、代表的选举没有经过充分的宣传酝酿，存在着包办代替马虎潦草的现象。代表候选名单，不是由群众酝酿讨论，一般是由干部确定后，即在选民大会上提名表决。有的村庄甚至经村干部商定人选后，报请区政府批准即为代表。如李官屯的代表杨子信就是这样选出来的，直到现在村民都不知道他是代表，只知道他是干部。十区曹庄的代表选出后，没有去开会，村干部就另外指定了一个人当代表。这样选出来的代表自然不能充分发挥作用，一般都认为自己只是“上级”政府委派传达工作任务的人，没有主人翁的自觉。再加上每次会议没有充分发扬民主精神，代表的意见没有得到应有的尊重，许多代表有顾虑。如李官屯的代表说：“咱有意见也不敢提，提了也不管事。”有的代表说：“提了意见，干部不听，还要记住你。”有的则消沉至于：“我当代表好久了，还不换换？”每次会议缺席的人数相当可观。除第一次会议出席的约占代表总数的百分之九十四外，第四次会议出席代表只占百分之六十一点四，其他几次会议缺席代表都在百分之二十左右。在近两年的时间内虽然代表的变化很大，有的调动工作，有的已死亡，有的违法失职撤消了代表的资格，有的根本不到会，但该县均未及时改选或补选。
    第二、建政初期对提案的处理还比较认真，但越往后越不重视。第一次各界人民代表会议有一百三十多件提案，第二次会议有六十多件提案，会议专门成立了“提案审查处理委员会”，负责收集、整理，并分别加以处理，有的当场交有关部门研究办理，有的请示上级后再决定，有的加以解释。虽然处理得不够好，但代表对于此种认真负责的态度感到满意。特别是第二次会议上接受代表的批评，将破坏林木和打骂村干部的二区区长撤职，更大大地启发了代表主人翁的感觉。但从第三次会议开始，该县就只注意如何布置和贯彻中心工作，会议的议程排得很紧，代表连提出提案的时间都没有，甚至连“提案审查处理委员会”也无形中取消了。自此以后再不见代表提出什么提案。而代表对于县各界人民代表会议也就愈来愈不大感兴趣了。
    第三、对于常务委员会不重视，没有充分发扬民主协商的精神。该县在召开第一次各界人民代表会议时即成立了常委会，原定每月开会一次，但始终未照着执行。除第一次和第二次会议之间，第二次和第三次会议之间曾召开两次常委会外，其余都是在人民代表会议快开会前才临时召开一次常委会，讨论政府起草的工作报告。因为事前没有给各常委充分的时间研究工作报告的内容，所以反映群众的呼声很少，只是通过政府的计划草案。常委对这种作法很不满意，有的说：“县政府说开就开，说不开就不开。”有的常委自参加第一次会后，就再不去开会。虽然该县在去年底增设了两个专职的常委会驻会委员，但他们都没有事作，和代表的联系很少，也从没有参加过县人民政府的行政会议。常委会从未向各界人民代表会议报告过工作，驻会委员也没有向常委会报告过工作。两个专职干部亦形同虚设。
    第四、对人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权采取消极态度，决而不行。该县在第一次各界人民代表会议上即提出：“召开全县普选的人民代表大会”。第二次各界人民代表会议时，该县副县长却解释说：“目前正值春耕，为尽量不误农时，改在农闲季节再选。”在这次会议和第四次会议上又作了代行人民代表大会职权的同样的决议，以后不但没有实现，而且从未向代表交待过。该县领导部门三度提出这个问题，都不够严肃和慎重，因为他们根本没有要它“代行”的诚意。据该县马副县长谈，会议上作这样的决议时本意就只是推拖应付。该县这种“决而不行”的作法，留给代表和群众以不良印象，损害了人民代表会议和政府的威信。
    这些现象的造成，有一些客观的困难，如工作任务多，一个压一个，而干部的质量又差，因而容易把各界人民代表会议当作布置工作的会议。不过最基本的原因还是领导干部不重视人民代表会议制度，把它和其他的工作对立起来。对于民主建政工作从来没有列入议事日程，进行讨论，理由是没有时间搞，甚至认为搞不好也没有什么关系。这种错误思想严重地削弱了该县的民主建政工作，并影响了对其他工作的推动。
