    Firmly Supporting the 38th Parallel as the Military Demarcation Line
            (I) To the Editors:
    Since the beginning of the Korean armistice talks, U.S. imperialism has been using various excuses to delay and sabotage the negotiations. Recently, on the issue of determining the military demarcation line, U.S. imperialism has even more unreasonably rejected our side's reasonable proposal to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, and arrogantly proposed to use a location north of the 38th parallel, far from the existing battle line, as the military demarcation line. This absurd demand fully demonstrates that U.S. imperialism lacks sincerity in the negotiations and attempts to continue its adventurous war of aggression against Korea. We cannot tolerate this shameless conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to undermine peace. The Chinese and Korean people have already made many concessions in order to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue; however, we can never accept the insatiable and absurd demands of U.S. imperialism. From the Korean armistice talks, all peace-loving people in the world can see very clearly: who is the aggressor and who is the maintainer of peace.
    The Chinese people understand that to strive for peace, we must never wait for peace. We must strengthen all work to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, to consolidate our national defense, strengthen our forces, and crush all possible aggression by U.S. imperialism.

            (II) To the Editors:
    Since the beginning of the Korean armistice talks, we have been watching the progress of this meeting with the greatest concern and vigilance. We hope that a peaceful solution to the Korean issue can be achieved. However, U.S. imperialism has made unreasonable demands on the issues of neutral zones and journalist interviews, and on the issue of the agenda for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea; during the negotiations, U.S. imperialism has intensified its indiscriminate bombing by the air force and provocative attacks by the army and navy. These facts fully demonstrate that U.S. imperialism lacks sincerity in peace negotiations. Recently, U.S. imperialism has even rejected our side's fair and reasonable proposal to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, and arrogantly demanded that the military demarcation line be established north of the 38th parallel, within our military positions, causing the negotiations to fall into a serious state of stagnation. We are all filled with immense resentment at the enemy's absurd and unreasonable demands. We must do a good job of the three tasks proposed by the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to the people of the whole country, and strive to exercise our bodies, ready to devote ourselves to the motherland and strike at the aggressors at any time.
    In addition, we also suggest that the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and its local branches widely publicize the progress and current situation of the Korean armistice talks to raise the vigilance of the people and promote our movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

            (III)
    At the Kaesong talks, which are of concern to the people of the world, U.S. imperialism has proposed to draw the military demarcation line north of the 38th parallel, deep within our military positions, with the "reason" being to obtain compensation for "air and sea supremacy" on land and to establish "defensive positions." We absolutely cannot accept this unreasonable demand.
    This unreasonable demand by U.S. imperialism even more nakedly shows that it has no sincerity for peace and that it wants to continue its war of aggression. U.S. imperialism has been beaten black and blue by the Chinese and Korean people, but it is not good at accepting this lesson. It doesn't know that if it didn't have the temporary "superiority" of its navy and air force, it would have been beaten to the bottom of the sea long ago. As for the latter reason, it is even more absurd in the extreme. To call the Chinese and Korean people, who are fighting to defend their homes and country and liberate their motherland, "aggressors," and to call themselves, who have come from thousands of miles to invade the territory of other countries, "defenders," this is the logic of the U.S. imperialists. The so-called "defense" of U.S. imperialism is just a synonym for aggression.
    We, the Chinese and Korean people, like all peace-loving people in the world, have always advocated a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue. The proposal made by our chief representative, General Nam Il, to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line represents the opinion of the Chinese and Korean people and is completely fair and reasonable. The Chinese and Korean people love peace and know how to strive for peace. We are closely watching the actions of U.S. imperialism and are fighting with our own strength to defend the motherland and defend world peace.

            (IV) To the Editors:
    Since the Korean armistice talks, our side has made many concessions in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and remove the obstacles created by U.S. imperialism with various excuses. This fully demonstrates the sincerity of our Chinese and Korean people for peace.
    However, U.S. imperialism has repeatedly and consciously adopted a delaying and sabotaging attitude towards peace negotiations. During the negotiations, they intensified their indiscriminate bombing of the peaceful people in the rear of Korea and constantly carried out provocative attacks. Recently, they even more unreasonably rejected the reasonable proposal to use the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line, and arrogantly clamored to set the military demarcation line north of the 38th parallel, deep within our military positions. This series of shameless acts fully demonstrates that U.S. imperialism lacks sincerity for peace.
    We must constantly expose and attack this shameless behavior of U.S. imperialism! We should also raise our vigilance, conscientiously implement the patriotic pact, enthusiastically donate airplanes and cannons, and do a good job in providing preferential treatment, so as to enhance our strength to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and completely crush all the enemy's conspiracies to undermine peace!

　　本报很多读者继续来信
    坚决拥护以三八线为双方军事分界线
            （一）编辑同志：
    从朝鲜停战谈判开始以来，美帝国主义一贯以种种借口，来拖延和破坏谈判。最近在确定双方军事分界线问题上，美帝国主义更无理拒绝我方以三八线为军事分界线的合理建议，狂妄地提出以三八线以北，距现有战线很远的地方为军事分界线。这一荒谬的要求，充分说明美帝国主义缺乏谈判诚意，企图继续进行其侵略朝鲜的冒险战争。美帝国主义这种破坏和平的无耻阴谋，我们是不能容忍的。中朝人民为了争取和平解决朝鲜问题，已经作了很多让步；但是，对美帝国主义得寸进尺、荒谬绝伦的要求，我们是决不能接受的。从朝鲜停战谈判中，全世界一切爱好和平的人们看的很清楚：谁是侵略者，谁是和平的维护者。
    中国人民懂得，要争取和平，而绝不能等待和平。我们要加强一切抗美援朝工作，来巩固国防，壮大我们的力量，以粉碎美帝国主义一切可能的侵略。

            （二）编辑同志：
    自从朝鲜停战谈判开始以来，我们以最大的关怀与警惕，注视着这个会议的进行。我们希望和平解决朝鲜问题能够实现。但是，美帝国主义在中立区问题及记者采访问题上，在一切外国军队撤离朝鲜的议程问题上，都曾经无理取闹；在谈判期中，美帝国主义却加紧了空军的狂轰滥炸和陆海军的挑衅攻击。这些事实，都十足表明了美帝国主义对于和平谈判是缺乏诚意的。最近，美帝国主义竟拒绝了我方以三八线为双方军事分界线的公平合理的建议，而狂妄地要求把军事分界线建立在三八线以北的我军阵地以内，致使谈判陷于严重的停滞状态。我们对敌人这种荒唐无理的要求都感到无比愤恨。我们一定要作好中国人民抗美援朝总会向全国人民提出的三件工作，并且努力锻炼身体，随时准备献身祖国，打击侵略者。
    此外，我们并建议中国人民抗美援朝总会及其各地分会把朝鲜停战谈判的经过和目前的情况广泛地进行宣传，以提高人民的警惕，推进我们的抗美援朝运动。

            （三）
    在全世界人民所关注的开城谈判会议上，美帝国主义竟提出将军事分界线划在三八线以北，深入我军阵地以内，其“理由”则是要在陆地上取得“海空军优势”的补偿以及为了建立“防御阵地”。这种无理要求，我们是绝对不能接受的。
    美帝国主义这种无理要求更露骨地表明了它是没有和平诚意的，它是想要继续其侵略战争的。美帝国主义被中朝人民打得头破血流，但却不善于接受这种教训。它不知道，它如果没有海空军暂时“优势”的“配合”，它早就要被打到海底去了。至于后一个理由，更是荒谬绝伦到极点。把为保家卫国和解放祖国而战斗的中朝人民说成“侵略”，而把不远千里而来侵略他国领土的自己，说成了“防御”，这就是美帝国主义者的逻辑。美帝国主义的所谓“防御”，不过是侵略的代名词罢了。
    我们中朝人民，和全世界一切爱好和平的人民一样，历来主张公平合理地解决朝鲜问题。我方首席代表南日将军所提出的以三八线为双方军事分界线的建议，是代表了中朝人民的意见，是完全公平合理的。中朝人民热爱和平，并且知道怎样去争取和平。我们密切注视着美帝国主义的行动，并且用自己的力量为保卫祖国，保卫世界和平而斗争。

            （四）编辑同志：
    朝鲜停战谈判以来，我方为了和平解决朝鲜问题，扫除美帝国主义以各种借口造成的障碍，作出了不少的让步。这充分表明了我中朝人民对和平的诚意。
    但是美帝国主义对于和平谈判，却一再有意识地采取拖延和破坏的态度。它们在谈判期间，竟加紧滥炸朝鲜后方和平人民，并不断进行挑拨性的进攻。最近更无理拒绝以三八线为双方军事分界线的合理建议，狂妄地叫嚣把军事分界线设在三八线以北深入我军阵地处。这一连串无耻的行为，充分说明美帝国主义是缺乏和平诚意的。
    对于美帝国主义这种无耻行为，我们必须不断地加以揭发和打击！我们更应当提高警惕，认真执行爱国公约，热烈捐献飞机大炮，作好优抚工作，以增强我们的抗美援朝力量，彻底粉碎敌人破坏和平的一切阴谋！
