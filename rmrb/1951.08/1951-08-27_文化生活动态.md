    Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Culture and Education Examines the Erroneous Tendency of Ignoring Politics
    Starting from August 2nd, the Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Culture and Education, including all section chiefs and secretaries, examined the tendency of ignoring politics and the positions, viewpoints, and methods of educators, in connection with the ideology and work of their respective departments and individuals. Everyone pointed out that they did not pay attention to the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" at the beginning, believing it was irrelevant to them or had little impact, and that it was making a mountain out of a molehill. In their work, they emphasized professional work and neglected politics, and lacked planning, thus appearing busy, chaotic, and passive. Zhang Jinan, Director of the Compilation and Review Department of the department, conducted a self-examination in connection with his own thoughts: "In the past, I often showed indifference to a political movement and the central work of each period; when reading documents, I did not first focus on the principles and policies, but only paid attention to details."
    Regarding the positions, viewpoints, and methods of education work, Jia Tonghai, Director of the Elementary Education Department, examined that in implementing the policy of opening up to workers and peasants, he mostly remained on the level of words and writing, and did not study concrete methods well to enable the children of workers and peasants to attend school. For example, some peasant children in the Fuping mountainous area could not attend school due to family poverty and lack of labor. However, the leadership did not actively think of solutions, but simply allowed these students to drop out of school. Some places did not take into account the specific conditions of rural areas, emphasized formality, or simply restricted them from the aspect of age, resulting in the loss of learning opportunities for peasant children. This shows that some comrades still lack a clear understanding of the question of "who does education serve" ideologically. In the aspect of universalizing education, many comrades only paid attention to quantity and neglected effectiveness.
    This examination by the Hebei Provincial Department of Culture and Education has been of great help in improving the ideological level and work quality of cadres. However, this is only the beginning of strengthening ideological leadership and overcoming the tendency of ignoring politics. It is absolutely necessary to conduct such examinations regularly in the future.

    The First Summer Marine Biology Training Class Officially Opens at Shandong University in Qingdao
    The summer marine biology training class jointly established by the Qingdao Marine Biology Research Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central Fisheries Experimental Institute, and Shandong University this summer at Shandong University in Qingdao, officially opened on July 23. Participants in this period of work and study include teachers and students from the biology departments of eight universities, including Zhejiang University, Shanghai University, Soochow University, Ginling College, Shanxi University, China Medical University, Tsinghua University, and Fu Jen Catholic University. Many university professors, scholars, and experts are giving lectures. During the study period, the teachers and students of the training class will not only conduct professional studies, but also conscientiously study the history of the Party.

    Corporal Punishment of Students Occurs Continuously in Various Places in Chahar South
    Recently, corporal punishment of students has occurred continuously in many schools in various places in Chahar South. For example, Song Xinwen, a teacher in Xinxingbao, Zhuolu, beat a thirteen-year-old girl until her nose and face were swollen; Wang Xuzhen, a teacher in Gucheng, Longguan, actually used ropes to tie up students when dealing with student disputes; Zhang Liangying, a teacher in Xuanhua No. 1 Elementary School, made students sit in solitary confinement; Guo Yongyu, a teacher in Balizhuang, beat students until they bled.
    This crude and barbaric teaching method violates the principles of New Democratic Education, because it damages the physical and mental health of children and seriously hinders their growth and normal development.
    The task of teachers should be to cultivate children, so that they have correct ideas, noble sentiments, love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, and cherish public property, and have a healthy physique. However, some teachers still lack sufficient understanding of this point. They have not yet thoroughly eliminated the erroneous understanding of corporal punishment ideologically.

    Tianjin Experiments with Radio Newspaper Reading
    The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Education Bureau and Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station have been using the current affairs study time of workers' spare-time schools to conduct radio newspaper reading experiments for students in spare-time schools. From the end of May to the end of July, for a period of one and a half months, they have achieved good results and preliminary experience. At present, the number of schools listening to radio newspaper reading has increased from nine to seventeen, and the number of people has expanded from more than 3,000 to 7,000. In addition, there are also schools listening indirectly, such as the teachers of the 120 Spare-time School, who use the radio newspaper reading materials from the previous day as materials for conducting current affairs education for workers. In the past, when teachers in spare-time schools conducted current affairs education, they were unable to grasp the focus of propaganda, making students feel that "reading the newspaper is too boring." But with radio newspaper reading, this problem is solved.
    Radio newspaper reading is broadcast for fifteen minutes each time, and the broadcast materials can be based on the current propaganda focus. The broadcasting format is also relatively diverse, so students find it very interesting to listen to, which aroused their attention to current affairs study. Experience has proved that using the current affairs study time of workers' spare-time schools to conduct radio newspaper reading is one of the effective methods of conducting current affairs political education for workers.

    China Association for Promoting Democracy Publishes Journal "Minjin"
    In order to strengthen the association's contact with members in various places, exchange work experience, and promote the development of association affairs, the China Association for Promoting Democracy decided at its thirteenth Central Standing Council meeting to publish the association journal "Minjin" by the headquarters. The journal is temporarily an irregular publication. The inaugural issue was published in May. The article "The Current Situation and Our Tasks" published in this issue by Ma Xulun, Chairman of the association, analyzes the domestic and international situation in detail, and points out the current tasks of democratic parties. In addition, there are documents and speeches on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, as well as work reports on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea from local branches. The second issue was published in July, with two special issues: "Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China" and "Three Major Patriotic Movements," including articles by Ma Xulun, Wang Shaoyu, Xu Guangping, Zhou Jianren, Yan Jingyao, Ke Ling and others. In addition, there are "Notes on the Wu Xun Problem" and "Current Affairs Research Materials."

    河北省人民政府文教厅检查不问政治的错误倾向
    河北省人民政府文教厅，自八月二日起，全厅科长、秘书一级以上干部，联系本部门和个人的思想与工作，检查了不问政治的倾向和教育工作者的立场、观点、方法等问题。大家指出：对“武训传”的讨论，开始时都不注意，认为与自己无关或影响不大，认为是小题大作；在工作上，重业务轻政治，而且缺乏计划性，因而显得忙乱被动。该厅编审处长张箕南同志联系自己的思想，进行了检查：“过去我对一个政治运动和每一时期的中心工作，往往表示冷淡；看文件材料，不先从方针原则方面着眼，只注意细节。”
    关于教育工作的立场、观点、方法问题，初等教育处长贾同海同志检查出：在执行向工农开门的方针上，多停滞在口头和文字上，没有很好地研究具体办法，使工农子女能够上学。如阜平山区有些农民子女，因家庭贫困，缺乏劳动力，不能上学。但领导上不去积极想办法，竟听任这些学童失学。有的地方不照顾农村具体情况，强调正规，或单纯从年龄方面加以限制，致使农民子女失掉学习的机会。这说明有些同志对“教育为谁服务”这一点，思想上还缺乏明确的认识。在普及教育方面，许多同志只注意数量，忽视效果。
    河北省文教厅这次检查，虽对提高干部思想水平和工作质量有很大的帮助。但这仅是加强思想领导，克服不问政治倾向的开端。今后定期进行这样的检查，是十分必要的。
            首届暑期海洋生物讲习班在青岛山东大学正式开课
    中国科学院青岛海洋生物研究室、中央水产试验所和山东大学，今年暑期在青岛山东大学联合创设的暑期海洋生物讲习班，已于七月二十三日开学。参加这期工作和学习的，有浙江大学、沪江大学、东吴大学、金陵大学、山西大学、中国医科大学、清华大学、辅仁大学等八校生物系的师生。进行讲课者，有大学教授、学者、专家多人。在学习期间，该讲习班的师生除进行业务学习外，并认真学习党史。
            察南各地连续发生体罚学生事件
    最近察南各地不少学校连续发生体罚学生的事件。如涿鹿辛兴堡教员宋新汶把一个十三岁的女生打得鼻青脸肿；龙关古城教员王蓄珍处理学生纠纷竟用绳索捆绑学生；宣化一完小教员张良英让学生坐禁闭；八里庄教员郭永裕把学生打出血来。
    这种粗暴和野蛮的教学方法，是违反新民主主义教育原则的，因为它损害到少年儿童的身心，严重地妨碍他们的成长和正常的发展。
    教师的任务，应该是培养儿童，使他们具有正确思想、高尚情操，热爱祖国、热爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物，有健康的体魄。但是某些教师对于这一点还缺乏足够的认识。他们还没有从思想上彻底肃清对于体罚的错误认识。
            天津试验广播读报
    天津市人民政府教育局和天津人民广播电台，利用工人业余学校的时事学习时间，对业余学校的学生进行广播读报试验，自五月底开始到七月底止，为时一个半月期间，已获得良好成绩和初步经验。目前收听广播读报的学校已由九校增加到十七校，人数由三千多扩大到七千人。此外，还有间接收听的学校，如一二○业余学校的老师，用头一天的广播读报材料，作为向工人进行时事教育的材料。过去业余学校的老师进行时事教育时因掌握不住宣传中心，使学生感到“读报太无聊”。但是有了广播读报，这个问题就解决了。
    广播读报每次广播十五分钟，广播的材料都能根据当前宣传中心。在播讲形式上也比较多样化，所以学生听起来觉得很有兴趣，引起了他们对时事学习的重视。经验证明，利用工人业余学校时事学习时间进行广播读报，是向工人进行时事政治教育的有效方法之一。
            民主促进会出版会刊“民进”
    中国民主促进会为加强该会与各地会员的联系，交流工作经验，促进会务发展，经该会第十三次中央常务理事会议决定由总部出版会刊“民进”。该刊暂为不定期刊。创刊号已于五月出版。本期发表的该会主席马叙伦的“当前的情势和我们的任务”一文，详细分析了国内国际的情势，并指出民主党派的现时任务。此外并有关于镇压反革命的文件、谈话及各地分会的抗美援朝工作报告等。第二期已于七月出版，内有“庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年”及“三大爱国运动”两个特辑，包括马叙伦、王绍鏊、许广平、周建人、严景耀、柯灵等人的文章。此外尚有“武训问题笔谈”、“时事研究资料”等。
