Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 19th: The U.S. "Daily Worker" published an editorial on August 14th stating that U.S. negotiators, in saying they want to "establish a demilitarized zone based on the current battle line and overall military situation," are attempting to create a buffer zone deep within North Korean territory. The editorial asked: Why don't the Pentagon and Washington tell the American people exactly what price the United States is demanding from the Koreans for a ceasefire? The newspaper said that it is impossible to discern what exactly is happening in Kaesong from the vague reports and deceptive talk published in the newspapers of American millionaires.

The newspaper said: "Washington refuses to accept the 38th Parallel as the dividing line because the 38th Parallel is not 'militarily defensible.' Does this mean they hope for further war in the future?"

The "Daily Worker" called on the American people to be vigilant against the U.S. imperialist plot to expand the war to China. The newspaper said: "The Pentagon's tactics in Kaesong are fatally dangerous, and this danger may still exist even after MacArthur is removed."

The editorial concluded, "We urge our American compatriots to intervene in the Kaesong negotiations, to demand that Truman implement a ceasefire, withdraw from the 38th Parallel, and then completely withdraw from Korea."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 19th: According to a report in the August 13th issue of the Canadian Forum, Mrs. Lord, head of the International Democratic Women's Federation's investigation team into the atrocities of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee troops in Korea, reported on the atrocities of the U.S. and British troops in Korea at an open-air mass meeting held by the Toronto Peace Council, saying: "The Kaesong armistice negotiations must continue and not be broken off until an armistice agreement is concluded."

She appealed to the Canadian people, especially Canadian mothers, saying: "How can we be at ease when young children all over the world are suffering the terrible pain of modern warfare—tens of thousands of children are homeless, hungry, and orphaned—and much of the suffering is caused by the wrong policy of sending our sons to bomb and burn their land? Let us join hundreds of millions of people in shouting that the war must stop. We have given life—we must help save life."

Mrs. Lord said: "We heard many accounts with real names, places, and exact dates of men being killed, men and women having their hands cut off, and women having their breasts cut off. We have repeatedly heard of pregnant women having their fetuses dug out and people being buried alive. "One woman had her tongue cut out and was buried alive because she did not answer the soldiers' questions. Some women and babies were stabbed to death with bayonets..."

The mass meeting unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Canadian government promote the success of the Kaesong negotiations.

　　美《工人日报》促请美国人民
    要求美军撤离三八线
    罗德夫人号召加拿大人民促成停战
    【新华社布拉格十九日电】美国《工人日报》八月十四日发表社论说：美国谈判人员说要“根据目前战线与全面军事局势建立非军事区”，他们是想在深入朝鲜北部的领土以内建立缓冲区域。社论问道：为什么五角大楼与华盛顿不把美国向朝鲜人所要求的停火的代价究竟是什么告诉全国人民呢？该报说，从美国百万富翁的报纸上所登的模糊的报道与欺诈的谈话里要看出开城究竟在进行一些什么事情，那是不可能的。
    该报说：“华盛顿拒绝以三八线为分界线，因为三八线不是在‘军事上可以防守的’。难道这是说他们盼望以后还要战争吗？”
    《工人日报》号召美国人民警惕美帝国主义企图把战争扩大到中国的阴谋。该报说：“五角大楼在开城的策略具有致命的危险，纵然在麦克阿瑟被撤职以后，这种危险也可能仍会发生。”
    社论在结语中说，“我们促请美国同胞们干涉开城谈判，要求杜鲁门实行停火，撤离三八线，以后再完全撤出朝鲜。”
    【新华社布拉格十九日电】据十三日的加拿大论坛报报道：国际民主妇联朝鲜美、李军暴行调查团团长罗德夫人在多伦多和平理事会主持召开的露天群众大会上报告侵朝美、英军队的暴行时说：“开城停火谈判必须进行下去，不许破裂，直到缔结停战协定时为止。”
    她向加拿大人民特别是向加拿大的母亲们呼吁说：“当世界各地的年幼儿童正遭受现代战争的可怖痛苦——成千成万的儿童无家可归、挨饿、失去父母——，而许多痛苦是由于派遣我们的儿子去轰炸和焚烧他们的国土的错误政策所造成的时候，我们怎么能安然自在呢？让我们跟亿万人们共同高呼战争必须停止吧。我们已给予了生命——我们必须协助拯救生命。”
    罗德夫人说：“我们听到许多有真实姓名、地点及确切日期的关于男人被杀，男人和妇女的手被砍掉及妇女乳房被割掉的事情，我们又一再听到怀孕妇女的胎儿被挖出及人们被活埋的事情。“一位妇女因为不答复士兵的问题而被割掉舌头，被活埋。有的妇女和婴儿一同被刺刀刺死……”
    大会群众一致通过决议，要求加拿大政府促使开城谈判获得成功。
