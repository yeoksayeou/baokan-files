　　The Glorious Communist Party Branch of Houtian Village
    Leads Farmers in Increasing Production and Making Donations
    Greatly Enhancing Farmers' Enthusiasm for Production
    The Communist Party Branch of Houtian Village in Longyan County, Fujian Province, actively leads all villagers in launching a campaign to increase production and make donations.

    Houtian Village is the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the land reform struggle by farmers in the western Fujian Province during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. The CCP branch in the village led the local farmers in a long and arduous struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, the CCP branch in the village led the farmers to restore and develop production, earning the glorious title of "Production Model Village" in the county.

    After the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued the call to donate airplanes and cannons, the farmers of Houtian Village responded enthusiastically. However, at the beginning, some people had a simple "reaching into their pockets" mentality about making donations. The CCP branch in the village repeatedly explained the significance of increasing production and making donations through various meetings, and led the farmers to specifically calculate and come up with many ways to expand production and increase income. The branch also called on each household and individual to formulate plans for increasing production and making donations. Communist Party members took the lead in formulating plans to set an example for the masses.

    Chen Jinsheng, an old Communist Party member who joined the party in 1928, took the lead in formulating a plan for increasing production and making donations in the second half of this year. His plan is: to increase fertilizer by 600 catties for six mu of late rice fields, ensuring an increase of 400 catties of grain; to plant an additional half mu of sweet potatoes, increasing production by 200 catties. He plans to donate a portion of these increased yields to purchase airplanes and cannons, and use the remaining increased portion to purchase fertilizer to expand production. Under the leadership of the CCP branch, all 175 households in Houtian Village have formulated plans for increasing production and making donations in the second half of this year, and have included this plan in the patriotic covenant.

    Based on the plans for increasing production and making donations formulated by each household, the farmers of Houtian Village formulated a plan for the entire village's increased production and donations for the second half of the year at a mass meeting. The plan is: to strive for each mu of late rice fields in the village to apply 25 to 40 catties of lime fertilizer to change acidic soil, cultivate meticulously, apply more fertilizer once, and weed once more, to ensure an increase of 14,000 catties of grain from 700 mu of late rice fields; to expand sideline production, increasing the number of charcoal kilns in the village from twelve to sixteen, and burning one more kiln of charcoal per kiln; to raise one more pig per household; to raise one more chicken and one more rabbit per person. To take out a part or all of the increased production to donate weapons.

    In the process of formulating plans for increasing production and making donations, the farmers of the village realized that the campaign to increase production and make donations could not only support the front lines and strengthen national defense, but also expand production and improve living standards, so their enthusiasm for production was greatly increased. For example, the charcoal kiln group led by Communist Party member Chen Jinchu, composed of nine farmers, after formulating a donation plan to add two charcoal kilns and increase charcoal production, the entire group stepped up production and increased charcoal production by more than 100 catties in less than half a month.

### 有光荣传统的后田村中共支部  领导农民增产捐献  使农民生产热情大大提高

　　有光荣传统的后田村中共支部
    领导农民增产捐献
    使农民生产热情大大提高
    福建省龙岩县后田村中国共产党支部积极领导全村农民展开增产捐献运动。
    后田村是第二次国内革命战争时期中国共产党领导福建省西部地区农民进行土地改革斗争的发源地。该村中共支部曾领导当地农民与国民党反动派进行了长期的艰苦的斗争。解放后，该村中共支部领导农民恢复和发展生产，得到了全县“生产模范村”的光荣称号。
    中国人民抗美援朝总会发出捐献飞机大炮的号召后，后田村农民即热烈响应，但在开始时，部分群众曾存在着“掏腰包”的单纯捐献思想。该村中共支部便通过各种会议，反复说明增产捐献的意义，并领导农民具体算账，想出了许多扩大生产增加收入的办法。支部并号召每户每人订立增产捐献计划。共产党员都带头订出计划，在群众中树立榜样。
    一九二八年入党的老共产党员陈金盛带头订出了今年下半年的增产捐献计划。他的计划是：六亩晚稻田增肥六百斤，保证增产四百斤谷子；多种半亩地瓜，增产二百斤。他准备从这些增产所得中捐出一部分购买飞机大炮，并把其余增产部分购进肥料，以扩大生产。在中共支部的领导下，后田村一百七十五户农民都已订出了今年下半年的增产捐献计划，并把这一计划列入爱国公约。
    根据各户订立的增产捐献计划，后田村农民在全村群众大会上订立了全村下半年的增产捐献计划。计划是：争取全村每亩晚稻田增施石灰肥二十五斤到四十斤，改变酸性土壤，精耕细作，多施一次肥，多锄一遍草，保证七百亩晚稻田增产谷子一万四千斤；扩大副业生产，全村由十二个炭窑增至十六个炭窑，每窑多烧一窑炭；每户增养一只猪；每人多养一只鸡、一只兔。把增产所得拿出一部分或全部捐献武器。
    该村农民在订立增产捐献计划中体会到增产捐献运动不仅可以支援前线，加强国防，而且可以扩大生产，改善生活，因此他们的生产积极性大大提高。如共产党员陈锦初领导九个农民组成的炭窑小组，在订出增设两个炭窑、增产木炭的捐献计划后，全组加紧生产，不到半个月就增产木炭一百多斤。
