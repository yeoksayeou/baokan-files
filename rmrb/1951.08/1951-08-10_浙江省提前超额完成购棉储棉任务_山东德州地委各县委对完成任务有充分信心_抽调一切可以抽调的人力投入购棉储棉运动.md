　　Zhejiang Province Exceeds Cotton Purchase and Storage Quota Ahead of Schedule
    Dezhou Prefectural Committee and County Committees of Shandong Have Full Confidence in Completing the Task
    Deploy All Available Manpower into the Cotton Purchase and Storage Campaign
    Zhejiang Province purchased and stored 7,325 dan of ginned cotton in June and July, exceeding the original quota by 144 percent, completing the four-month cotton purchase task from May to August one month ahead of schedule. The main reason why Zhejiang Province exceeded its cotton purchase and storage quota was that responsible cadres at all levels of the People's Government attached importance to this work and carried out relatively sufficient publicity and mobilization among cotton farmers. In many places, cadres and activists adopted the "contract system" for publicity, conducting publicity and mobilization village by village and household by household. Yuyao County, a major cotton-producing area in Zhejiang Province, has 107 cotton-producing townships, of which 74 townships underwent in-depth publicity and mobilization by cadres village by village and household by household, and 33 townships underwent general publicity. Therefore, the cotton purchased and stored in the county in June and July exceeded the original quota by 203 percent.
    Although Zhejiang Province has completed the cotton purchase and storage work ahead of schedule, according to investigations, farmers still have a lot of cotton in their hands. The provincial leading organs have now decided to continue to mobilize cotton farmers to sell and store cotton. (Xinhua News Agency)
    On July 29, the Dezhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Shandong Province convened separate meetings of county committee secretaries to study and arrange work for August, with emphasis on cotton purchase and storage. After discussions, the county committee secretaries expressed full confidence in completing the cotton purchase and storage task. According to the reports of the county committee secretaries of Pingyuan, Dongguang, De County, and Nanpi, who participated in the meeting, cotton aphids have been basically eliminated after vigorous control. Many cotton seedlings have grown new branches and leaves two or three inches high; the disaster has stopped spreading. In addition, the recent rainfall has been favorable, and the cotton plants are growing very well. As long as we seize the opportunity to repair and continue to fight against the insect pests, we can still ensure a good cotton harvest.
    In the control of cotton aphids, some places have combined it with the cotton purchase and storage work. For example, Wang Guozhen and other four townships in the sixth district of Nanpi County purchased and stored more than 25,000 jin of cotton in four days during the aphid control period; Dongguang County purchased more than 30,000 jin of cotton during the aphid control period. However, most areas did not combine these two tasks well; coupled with the lack of understanding of the cotton purchase and storage work in the previous period and the failure to carry it out vigorously, the majority of areas did not fully mobilize the masses, and the work results were not significant, falling far short of the task. Among the four counties, Nanpi completed more (40.5 percent of the task), while the other counties completed very little. Dongguang County completed only 350,000 jin of the 4 million jin task. Based on the above situation, the meeting conducted full discussions and research on how to ensure the completion of the cotton purchase and storage task in the future. Everyone agreed that to complete this arduous task, party committees and cadres at all levels must attach importance to it ideologically. According to investigations, the masses have a large amount of cotton in storage. Calculated on the basis that cotton farmers in the entire region have an average storage volume of 10 to 15 percent, the task should be completed. The problem lies in how much subjective effort is made.
    Based on the experience of the previous stage, the meeting decided to hold several major meetings, namely, the meeting of major cadres in the district, the general meeting of party members and League members in the township, the meeting of cotton farmer representatives in one or several townships, and the small-scale representative meetings of women, teachers, and students in the township. Full mobilization should be carried out at various meetings, calling on cadres and party members to truly play an exemplary leading role, ensuring that they first sell and store their own cotton to the state, and then mobilize the masses to sell and store. In terms of organizational leadership, each county must have a county committee member and the district committee secretary in each district personally in charge of this work, and deploy all possible forces into this movement. Give play to the organizational role of various departments and systems, and clarify the division of labor. The nearly 200 organ cadres sent by the prefectural committee and the special commissioner's office to various counties to help eliminate aphids will continue to switch to cotton purchase and storage work under the unified leadership of the local party committees and governments to assist in completing this task.
    The meeting decided that the cotton purchase and storage work in general areas will be listed as a blitz task in the first and middle ten days of August and combined with the completion of the summer grain tax. Other work that can be postponed should be postponed to the last ten days of August as much as possible. However, all localities should pay attention to adapting to local conditions and proceeding from reality. Areas with serious insect pests can still focus on pest control, but it is necessary to closely combine it with cotton purchase and storage work. In areas with relatively light insect pests, cotton purchase and storage should be the main focus, combined with pest control. After the insect pests in a township (or district) are eliminated, it should immediately switch to cotton purchase and storage, and must not wait for unified action. During the pest control period, the method of combining pest control during the day and cotton purchase at night can also be adopted. In the work, counties, districts, and townships must grasp the key points, learn from experience, and promote the overall situation; but prevent the tendency of working at the key points for too long or rigidly adhering to the key points in isolation.

　　浙江省提前超额完成购棉储棉任务
    山东德州地委各县委对完成任务有充分信心
    抽调一切可以抽调的人力投入购棉储棉运动
    浙江省六、七两月购、储皮棉七千三百二十五担，超过原定任务百分之一百四十四，提前一个月完成了五月到八月四个月的购棉任务。浙江省超额完成购棉储棉任务的主要原因，是各级人民政府的负责干部重视这一工作并对棉农进行了比较充分的宣传动员。有许多地方的干部和积极分子，采取了“包干制”的宣传办法，逐村逐户地进行宣传、动员。浙江省主要产棉区余姚县有一百零七个乡产棉，其中七十四个乡经过干部逐村逐户深入宣传、动员，三十三个乡进行了一般的宣传。因此该县六、七两月购、储的棉花超过了原定任务的百分之二百零三。
    浙江省购棉储棉工作虽已提前超额完成任务，但根据调查，农民手中仍有不少存棉。现省的领导机关已决定继续发动棉农售棉储棉。（新华社）
    中共山东省德州地委于七月二十九日分头召开各县县委书记会议，研究与布置八月份工作，其中着重购棉储棉工作。经过座谈讨论之后，各县县委书记对完成购棉储棉任务都表示有充分的信心。根据参加会议的平原、东光、德县、南皮四县县委书记报告，各县棉蚜虫经大力除治，现已基本消灭。很多棉苗又长出了二、三寸高的新枝新叶；灾害已停止发展。加之近来雨水调和，棉棵长得很好。只要抓紧修理，继续与虫灾斗争，仍能保证棉花丰收。
    在除治棉蚜中，有的地方曾结合进行购棉储棉工作。如南皮县六区王国珍等四个乡，在灭蚜期中四天内购储棉花二万五千多斤；东光全县在灭蚜期中收购棉花三万多斤。但大部地区则没有把这两项工作很好地结合起来；加之前一段对购棉储棉工作认识不足，没有大力地进行，因而除个别地区作得较好以外，大部地区都没有把广大群众充分地发动起来，工作成绩不大，距完成任务数还差得很远。四县中除南皮完成的较多（占任务的百分之四十点五）以外，其他县完成得都很少。东光县四百万斤的任务，仅完成三十五万余斤。根据上述情况，会议对今后如何保证完成购棉储棉任务，作了充分的讨论与研究。大家一致认为，要完成这一艰巨任务，各级党委和干部必须从思想上重视起来。据调查，群众中是存有大量棉花的。以全区棉农平均尚有百分之十至十五的储存量计算，应该是可以完成任务的。问题在于主观努力如何。
    根据前一阶段的经验，会议决定要开好几个主要会议，即区的主要干部会，乡的党员及团员大会，一乡或数乡的棉农代表会议，乡的妇女、教员、学生等小型代表会议。在各种会议上进行充分动员，号召干部及党员真正起模范带头作用，保证先把自己的棉花售、储给国家，进而发动广大群众售储。在组织领导上，各县必须有一个县委委员及各区的区委书记亲自掌握这一工作，并抽调一切可能抽出的力量投入这一运动。发挥各部门、各系统的组织作用，明确分工。地委、专署派往各县帮助灭蚜的近二百名机关干部，继续在当地党委和政府统一领导下，转入购棉储棉工作，协助完成这一任务。
    会议决定：一般地区的购棉储棉工作将列为八月上、中旬的突击任务，并结合完成夏征。其他可以缓办的工作，尽量推迟到八月下旬。但各地应注意因地制宜，从实际出发。虫灾严重地区仍可以除虫为主，但要紧密结合购棉储棉工作。在虫灾较轻地区，即以购棉储棉为主，结合除虫。一个乡（或区）的虫灾消灭了以后，即应立即转入购棉储棉，绝不能等待统一行动。在除虫期间，也可采取白天除虫晚上购棉的办法结合进行。在工作中，各县、区、乡都要掌握基点，吸取经验，推动全面；但应防止基点工作时间过长或孤立死守基点的偏向。（王致中）
