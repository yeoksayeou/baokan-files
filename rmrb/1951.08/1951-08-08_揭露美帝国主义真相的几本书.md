Several Books Exposing the Truth about American Imperialism
    Bao Ding
    (《The Expansion of American Imperialism》by Marion, People's Publishing House
    《Inside News》by Shirinsky, Times Publishing House
    《Wall Street》by Rozanov, World Knowledge Press
    《The Rule of Wall Street》by Zhu Tong, World Knowledge Press
    《What Kind of Country is America》by Huang Zhuo, China Youth Publishing House)
    To expose the inside story of Wall Street, the center of the reactionary rule of American imperialism, to reveal the real situation of American imperialism's expansion in the world, and the aggressive policy of the American ruling group serving the interests of monopoly capital, so as to understand what kind of country the United States is, its history, current situation and future trends, is very important for the Chinese people who are fighting heroically against American imperialism.
    American imperialism has long been involved in a global struggle of aggression. After World War II, in the capitalist world, the power of the United States surpassed all capitalist countries, realizing its dominance. In the regions where the rule of Britain and other capitalist countries ended, American suppression began there, which is the current situation of the struggle between capitalist countries. From the book "The Expansion of American Imperialism" by Marion, we can see the American military bases and aggressive strongholds distributed in Asia, Europe, Africa and Australia, and see a detailed map of the scope of American aggressive forces in various regions such as the Western Hemisphere, the Atlantic region, the Pacific region, and Asia, and the status of American military strategic control areas.
    However, no matter how large the scope of its aggressive forces expands, American imperialists are always afraid of the power of the people of the world and their own people fighting for peace and justice. Therefore, it cannot but make all kinds of deceptive lies as cover. In December 1945, shortly after taking office as president, Truman announced the so-called twelve "moral principles," saying that the United States had "no ambition to expand its territory." American imperialists often claim that they are "defenders of the rights of small countries," and describe themselves as warriors "upholding national self-determination"; when they use unprecedented military power and resources to invade and plunder other countries, they always say that this is purely for "philanthropy"; saying that its territorial expansion is for "defense," and what is required is "justice," "open door," "democratic goodwill," and so on; when it carries out massacres in Korea, it says this is a "police action" for the sake of "world peace." American imperialism has replaced the role of fascist Hitler, and under the guise of preventing the "Bolshevik threat," it has expanded its worldwide aggression, explaining its aggressive policy as a "defense against Soviet provocation."
    The author of "The Expansion of American Imperialism," George Marion, is a progressive American journalist. In this book, he collected materials that are usually not easily available to American readers, shattered these lies, and thoroughly exposed the history and current situation of American imperialism's aggressive conspiracy. He attempted to tell these truths to the American people, and called on the American people to unite, overthrow the masterminds of these new war instigators, change American policy, and establish world peace. This is a good book worth introducing to everyone for studying the issue of American aggressive policy.
    "Inside News" is a record of the facts that the author Shirinsky observed the activities of the British and American authorities and their reactionary newspaper representatives in Germany for several years after the war, and came into contact with enough to expose the propaganda activities of the war mongers. This booklet clarifies the nature of the policies adopted and the propaganda made by European and American imperialist countries, especially the United States, so that we can understand the conspiracies and policies of Wall Street to launch a new war. At the same time, we can see from here that the invincible peace camp headed by the powerful socialist country, the Soviet Union, is blocking the path of the war instigators. In front of this camp, Wall Street's lying pawns are already powerless.
    The book "Wall Street" describes the aggressive policy of American imperialism; reports on the activities of those major conspirators of American imperialism, the fascistization of American social and political life, and the content and style of the American reactionary newspapers; the last chapter clarifies the growth and consolidation of American progressive forces, and the struggle for the democratic rights and freedom of the American people.
    "The Rule of Wall Street" is also a book exposing the truth about Wall Street. It was written by the author Zhu Tong (professor of Sunan College of Culture and Education) in the United States, based on some original materials he collected in the "Congressional Materials Room" of the University of Wisconsin Library and materials obtained from other places. The author uses conclusive facts and popular language to expose the tools of Wall Street's rule—political parties, Wall Street's ruling methods—elections, the secrets of Wall Street's rule—the activities of the Third House, the institutions of Wall Street's rule—the government, and the truth about Wall Street's bloody suppression of the resistance of the American working class.
    "What Kind of Country is America" is a popular reading material about American issues. Illustrations or photos are attached in the middle of each article, which can be provided for readers and children with generally lower cultural levels. In this book, the author describes the nature of the American imperialist country, whether there is democracy and freedom in the United States, how American imperialists oppress black people, the lives of the American people, and the issues of American imperialism's aggression against Korea.
    From these books, especially from the book "The Expansion of American Imperialism," we can have a deeper understanding of the nature of the American imperialist country, the roots and truth of its aggressive policy, and the process of its conspiracy to invade China, Korea and other Asian countries. From the history of American imperialists' aggression against Korea revealed here, we can more clearly see that even if American imperialism has been severely hit by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies and suffered a shameful defeat on the Korean battlefield, even if its aggression in various parts of the world has encountered heroic resistance from the people, even if its continued aggression will surely accelerate its final demise; But American imperialism cannot and is unwilling to remember the lessons of history, and its aggressive policy and conspiracy to launch a new war will never stop on their own until it has suffered a decisive blow.

　　揭露美帝国主义真相的几本书

    揭发美帝国主义反动统治的中心——华尔街的内幕，暴露美帝国主义在全世界扩张的实况以及为垄断资本利益服务的美国统治集团的侵略政策，从而使我们了解美国是一个什么样的国家，它的历史、现状和今后的动向，对于正在和美帝国主义作英勇斗争的中国人民，是十分重要的。
    美国帝国主义早就卷进一个全球性的侵略斗争的漩涡中了。在第二次世界大战后，在资本主义世界内，美国的势力更驾凌于一切资本主义国家之上，实现了它的独霸。英国和其他资本主义国家统治告终的地区，美国的镇压就在那里开始，这就是资本主义国家间斗争的目前情况。从马立昂著《美帝国主义的扩张》一书中，我们可以看到分布在欧亚非澳各大洲的美国的军事基地和侵略据点，看到目前在西半球、大西洋区、太平洋区、亚洲等各地区的美国的侵略势力的范围，美国军事战略控制地区状况的一幅详图。
    但是，尽管它的侵略势力扩张到何等大的范围，美帝国主义者总是害怕全世界人民和本国人民为和平与正义而斗争的力量的。因此它不能不作种种欺骗的谎言来作掩护。一九四五年十二月杜鲁门在它就任总统职位后不久，就宣布了所谓十二条“道义原则”，说美国并“没有扩张领土的野心”。美帝国主义者经常宣称它自己是“小国权利的维护者”，把它自己描写成为“维护民族自决”的武士；当它动用空前的军力和资源向别国进行侵略和掠夺的时候，它总是说这纯粹是为了“博爱主义”；说它的领土扩张为的是“防卫”，所要求的是“正义”，“门户开放”、“民主的善意”等等；当它在朝鲜进行屠杀的时候，说这是“警察的行动”，为的是“全世界的和平”。美帝国主义已经代替法西斯希特勒的角色，在防止“布尔什维克的威胁”的借口下，扩大全世界的侵略，把它的侵略政策，解释成为“对苏联挑衅的防卫”。
    “美帝国主义的扩张”的作者乔治·马立昂是一个进步的美国记者，他在这本书中搜集了美国读者平时不易得到的材料，粉碎了这种谎言，详尽地揭发了美帝国主义侵略阴谋的历史和目前的状况，他企图把这些真相告诉美国人民，并呼吁美国人民团结起来，打倒这些新战争挑拨者的祸首，改变美国政策，建立世界的和平。这是一本值得介绍给大家的一本研究美国侵略政策问题的好书。
    《内幕新闻》，是作者席林斯基战后数年内在德国观察了英美当局及其反动报纸的代表们的活动，所接触到的足以揭发战争贩子们的宣传活动的事实的记载。这本小册子阐明欧美帝国主义国家，首先是美国所采取的政策和所作的宣传的性质，使我们了解华尔街发动新战争的阴谋和政策。同时我们可以从这里看到，以强大的社会主义国家苏联为首的不可战胜的和平阵营，正在阻挡着战争挑拨者的道路，在这个阵营面前，华尔街强盗的撒谎走卒已经无能为力了。
    《华尔街》一书叙述了美帝国主义的侵略政策；报道了关于美帝国主义那些主要的阴谋家们的活动情形，关于美国社会政治生活的法西斯化以及美国反动报纸的内容和作风；最后一章阐明了美国进步力量的生长和巩固，为争取美国人民的民主权利和自由而斗争的情形。
    《华尔街的统治》也是揭发华尔街真相的一本书籍，这是作者朱彤（苏南文化教育学院教授）在美国的时候，根据他在威斯康辛大学图书馆的“国会资料室”内搜集的一些原始材料以及从其他地方所得到的材料所写成的。作者用确凿的事实和通俗的笔调，揭露了华尔街统治的工具——政党，华尔街统治的手法——选举，华尔街统治的秘密——第三院的活动，华尔街统治的机构——政府以及华尔街对美国工人阶级的反抗实行血腥镇压的真相。
    《美国是什么样的一个国家》，是一本写美国问题的通俗读物，在每篇文章中间并附有插图或照片，可以供给一般文化水平较低的读者和少年儿童阅读。作者在这本书中叙述了美帝国主义国家的性质，美国有没有民主和自由？美帝国主义者怎样压迫黑人？美国人民的生活以及美帝国主义侵略朝鲜等问题。
    从这几本书特别是从《美帝国主义的扩张》一书中，我们可以比较深刻地了解美帝国主义国家的性质，它的侵略政策的根源和真相，它的侵略中国、朝鲜和亚洲其他国家阴谋的过程。从这里所揭露的美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的历史我们可以更加清楚地看到：即便美帝国主义已经受到中朝人民军队的严重打击，在朝鲜战场上遭受了可耻的失败，即便它在世界各地的侵略遇到了人民的英勇抵抗，即便它的继续侵略一定会加速它的最后灭亡的命运；但是美帝国主义并不能也不愿意去记取历史的教训，它的侵略政策和发动新战争的阴谋，在尚未遭受到决定性的打击以前，决不会自行停止的。
