　　Central People's Government Administration Council Directive on Conserving Timber

　　As the cause of production and construction gradually unfolds, the demand for timber is also rapidly increasing. However, China's existing forest area is originally insufficient to meet the needs, and the forest areas are remote and transportation is difficult, thus forming the current situation of timber supply falling short of demand. On the other hand, many state-owned enterprises, institutions, military units, schools, and organizations have serious waste and unreasonable phenomena in the use of timber. In order to ensure the needs of construction, in addition to instructing people's governments at all levels to vigorously mobilize the masses to carry out afforestation and forest protection work, in order to gradually increase the timber supply, the whole country must practice strict economy in timber felling and use, and prevent waste. For this reason, the following instructions are hereby given:

　　1. The Financial and Economic Committees of people's governments at all levels should, in view of the national shortage of timber, strictly review the plans of all units requiring timber, and strictly prohibit false reports and excessive claims. The engineering and construction plans should also be strictly reviewed according to the source of timber to decide whether or not to approve them, so as to avoid the mistake of approving the plans but then failing to supply timber, resulting in unnecessary losses.

　　2. All departments requiring timber shall not transfer or sell the timber allocated by the state's unified plan, except for trade departments, and those who violate this provision shall be punished according to law. If there is surplus timber, it shall be reported to the financial and economic committee above the provincial level for handling.

　　3. Local people's governments shall not solve local financial problems by felling timber, except for the state's assigned timber felling tasks, and those who violate this provision shall be punished according to law.

　　4. No state-owned enterprise, institution, military unit, organization, or school shall fell timber or engage in timber trading business for any reason or in any name, and those who violate this provision shall be punished according to law.

　　5. All engineering and construction projects of state-owned enterprises, institutions, military units, organizations, and schools should effectively reduce the quantity of timber required to the lowest standard: those that are not urgently needed should be used slowly or less; those that can be replaced by other materials such as bamboo, cement, bricks, and stones should not be used or reduced.

　　6. The use of timber should be based on the principle of economy, and strive for economic rationality: it is forbidden to use large materials for small purposes, long materials for short purposes, and good materials for inferior purposes; it is advocated that Yang wood, birch, willow wood, and old and waste materials should be appropriately utilized under the condition that engineering safety is not harmed (for example, mines should promote the movement to recover mine pillars).

　　7. Railway sleepers, utility poles, and some civil engineering timber should be gradually treated with preservatives to extend the service life of the timber.

　　8. Paper-making raw materials should make full use of bamboo, reeds or other fibrous plants; pulp mills that use timber as raw materials, whether newly established or restored and expanded from old factories, must be reported to the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government in conjunction with the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government for approval before they can be implemented.

　　9. In areas where timber and charcoal are habitually used as fuel, in addition to actively promoting the planting of fuel forests, if the local coal source is not lacking, it should be advocated to gradually switch to coal fuel, and it is forbidden to sell good finished timber as fuel.

　　10. Reward inventions and discoveries that utilize waste materials and replace timber with other materials. Plywood is a good utilization form for saving timber, and plywood factories should be rewarded for restoring and establishing them in appropriate places. Encourage the construction of various fast-growing trees (such as Chinese fir, eucalyptus, paulownia, poplar, locust, etc.).

　　11. People's governments at all levels, competent authorities, and supervisory agencies should regularly pay attention to checking the use of timber by state-owned enterprises, institutions, military units, organizations, and schools. Those who have made achievements in saving timber shall be commended and rewarded; those who violate the provisions of Items 2, 3, and 4 of this instruction and other acts of wasting timber shall be punished.

　　12. All units that use a large amount of timber should have the responsible person of each unit, according to this instruction, convene a meeting to conduct a review, make specific resolutions on the issue of saving timber in the future, stipulate an inspection system, and educate cadres and workers, and mobilize them to incorporate the conservation and rational use of timber into the patriotic pact, so that timber conservation becomes a mass work.

　　中央人民政府政务院关于节约木材的指示
    随着生产建设事业的逐渐开展，木材需要量亦迅速大量增加。但我国现有森林面积原不敷需要，加以森林区偏僻，运输困难，因而形成目前木材供不应求的状况。而另一方面，许多公营企业、机关、部队、学校和团体，在使用木材上，却又存在着严重的浪费和不合理的现象。为保证建设需要，除责成各级人民政府大力发动群众进行护林造林工作，以求逐渐增加木材供应量外，对木材采伐和使用，全国必须厉行节约，防止浪费。为此，特作如下指示：
    一、各级人民政府财政经济委员会，应根据国家缺乏木材的情况，严格审查各需要木材单位的计划，严禁虚报多领；对工程建筑计划，亦应根据木材的来源，进行严格审查，决定批准与否，以避免计划批准了、但因为木材供应不上、又使计划落空的错误，从而招致不应有的损失。
    二、各需要木材的部门，经国家统一计划调拨到的木材，除贸易部门外，一律不得转让或出售，违者依法论处；其有剩余木材时，应报请省以上财政经济委员会处理。
    三、地方人民政府除国家布置伐木任务应予完成外，不得再用采伐木材方式，解决地方财政问题，违者依法论处。
    四、任何公营企业、机关、部队、团体和学校，不得以任何理由用任何名义采伐木材和经营买卖木材生意，违者依法论处。
    五、各公营企业、机关、部队、团体和学校的一切工程建筑，应将需用木材数量，切实核减至最低标准：非迫切需要的，应缓用或少用；可以其他材料如竹头、水泥、砖、石等代替的，应不用或减用。
    六、使用木材应本节约原则，力求经济合理：禁止大材小用、长材短用、优材劣用；提倡在不妨害工程安全的条件下，适当利用杨木、桦木、柳木和陈材、废材（例如矿场推行收回矿柱运动）。
    七、枕木、电杆和某些土木工程用材，应逐渐进行防腐，延长木料使用年限。
    八、造纸原料，应尽量利用竹头、芦苇或其他纤维植物；利用木材作原料的纸浆厂，不论新设或恢复和扩大旧厂，均须报经中央人民政府轻工业部会同中央人民政府林垦部批准，始得实行。
    九、在习惯上使用木材、木炭当作燃料的地区，除应积极推广种植薪炭林外，如当地煤源并不缺乏，应提倡逐步改用煤炭燃料，并禁止将良好的成材木料劈作燃料出售。
    十、奖励研究利用废材和用其他材料代替木材的发明和发现，胶合板是节省木材的一种好的利用形式，应在适当地点奖励恢复和设立胶合板厂。鼓励营造生长迅速的各种林木（如杉木、桉树、泡桐、白杨、洋槐等）。
    十一、各级人民政府各主管部门和监察机关，应经常注意检查各公营企业、机关、部队、团体和学校使用木材的情况，对节用木材有成绩的，予以表扬奖励；对违反本指示第二、三、四等项规定及其他有浪费木材行为的，予以惩处。
    十二、凡使用木材较多的单位，应由各该单位负责人员，根据本指示，召开会议，进行检讨，对今后节用木材问题，作出具体决议，规定检查制度，并对干部和工人进行教育，发动他们把节约和合理使用木材，订入爱国公约，使节约木材成为群众性的工作。
                            总理  周恩来  一九五一年八月十三日
