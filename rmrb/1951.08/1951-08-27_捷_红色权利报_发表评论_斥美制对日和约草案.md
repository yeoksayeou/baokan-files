　　Czech "Red Right News" Publishes Commentary
    Denouncing U.S.-Drafted Treaty with Japan
    【Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 26th】The "Red Right News" commented on the U.S.'s proposed "peace treaty" with Japan on the 22nd, saying that this proposal greatly violates the Cairo Declaration and the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements, which the United States also signed. The "Red Right News" emphasized: The main attempt of the U.S. imperialists is to obtain a "legal" basis for the unlimited military occupation of Japan. They are not only striving to occupy and intensify the exploitation of Japan but also striving to establish their main base for aggression in the Far East on the Japanese islands, following the model of West Germany.
    The report emphasized: "However, the vast majority of all mankind spurns the U.S. draft "peace treaty" with Japan, which is actually a war treaty between U.S. imperialists and revived Japanese imperialists."
    The report concluded: The Soviet delegation will speak on behalf of peace-loving humanity in San Francisco. They hope that Japan will become a peace-loving, democratic, and independent country, cooperating with all peace-loving countries on an equal footing.

　　捷“红色权利报”发表评论
    斥美制对日和约草案
    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】“红色权利报”二十二日评论美国的对日“和约”建议说：这个建议大大地违背了美国也签过字的开罗宣言与雅尔塔及波茨坦协定。“红色权利报”强调指出：美帝国主义者主要的企图是为无限制地军事占领日本取得“法律上的”根据，他们不仅努力要占领和加紧剥削日本，而且努力要在日本诸岛依照西德的模型建立他们侵略远东的战争的主要基地。
    该报强调说：“但是，全人类绝大多数都唾弃美国的对日“和约”草案，这个草案实际上是美帝国主义者与复活了的日本帝国主义者之间的战争条约。”
    该报在结语中说：苏联代表团在旧金山将代表爱好和平的人类发言，他们希望日本成为一个爱好和平的、民主的、独立的国家，在平等的基础上与一切爱好和平的国家合作。
