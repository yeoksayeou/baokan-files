Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 1st. The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland Front sent a telegram to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, congratulating them on the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Army. The telegram reads as follows: Dear comrades commanders, fighters, political workers and logistics workers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

　　Today, as we celebrate the 24th anniversary of the founding of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Central Committee of the Democratic Fatherland Front, on behalf of all members of the democratic parties, social organizations and the entire patriotic Korean people under the banner of the Fatherland Front, extends warm congratulations to the respected Commander Peng Dehuai and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　Since its founding by the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has, over the past few decades, carried out the work of eliminating domestic warlords, opposing the Japanese imperialist invading army, and eliminating and expelling the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang and the invading forces of American imperialism. As a result, 475 million Chinese people have been permanently freed from the shackles of aggression and oppression. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has now grown into a powerful, ever-victorious armed force that defends the freedom, independence, and honor of the motherland and has become a great army that makes great contributions to maintaining peace in the East.

　　Therefore, not only the Chinese people, but also the working people, oppressed nations, and peace-loving people all over the world respect and highly praise the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　In particular, we, the Korean people, who share borders with China and have a long history of friendship, regard the great victory of the Chinese people and their powerful revolutionary armed forces—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—as our own victory and cheer for it.

　　We also remember that as early as 350 years ago, the Chinese people aided the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War against the Japanese aggressors, and in the recent century when our country was invaded by Japan, they aided and supported the Korean people.

　　This fraternal connection between the Chinese and Korean peoples was further strengthened during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the great Liberation War of the Chinese people.

　　Our outstanding sons and daughters in China fought selflessly for the liberation of the Chinese people.

　　In this way, the blood ties and friendship of the common struggle between the two peoples, formed in history, have been further consolidated in the great Fatherland Liberation War in which the Korean people, under the leadership of their beloved leader General Kim Il-sung, are fighting against the American imperialist aggressors.

　　The Chinese people sent their powerful volunteer forces to aid the Korean people when they were facing the most difficult times.

　　We, the Korean people, will never forget the noble blood that you shed on the land of our motherland in the struggle to aid us, the Korean people, against the American imperialist aggressors, and the heroic feats you have performed through your heroic struggle, which will be passed on to future generations and will always be honored.

　　The Korean people, who were liberated from the rule of Japanese imperialism by the force of the Soviet army led by the great Stalin, have formed a fraternal friendship and strong unity with the Chinese people, and as part of the international democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union, which is a bulwark of world peace and security, have become an invincible force in the cause of safeguarding peace and security in the East.

　　Victory and glory to the heroic commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

　　Long live the great commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! Long live the 24th anniversary of the founding of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army!

　　Long live the eternal fraternal fighting friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples!

　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the founder of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

　　Long live General Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army!

　　Long live Marshal Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world and the banner of world peace and security!

　　Xinhua News Agency, 31st. Choi Yong-kun, Minister of National Defense of Korea, sent a telegram to Commander-in-Chief Zhu, congratulating him on the Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The telegram reads as follows: General Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

　　On the occasion of the 24th anniversary of the founding of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, I, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and myself, would like to extend our fraternal congratulations and greatest glory to you and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　All the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, who have risen up for the great Fatherland Liberation War to eliminate the American imperialist aggressors, are encouraged and inspired by the historic victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary regime and defeating foreign imperialist intervention, and are further consolidating their confidence in victory.

　　In order to consolidate peace and security, I congratulate the Chinese People's Liberation Army for its power and wish it even greater strength and new victories in the future.

    朝祖国战线致电志愿军
    朝鲜保卫相电朱总司令致贺
    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜祖国战线中央委员会致电中国人民志愿军全体指挥员战斗员，祝贺中国人民军队创建二十四周年。电文如下：亲爱的中国人民志愿军全体指挥员战斗员、政治工作者及后勤的工作同志们！
    今天迎接英雄的中国人民解放军建军二十四周年，祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会谨代表祖国战线旗帜下的各民主政党、社会团体的全体党员盟员及全朝鲜爱国人民，向敬爱的彭德怀司令员以下中国人民志愿军全体指挥员战斗员同志致以热烈的祝贺。
    中国人民解放军自从由以毛主席为首的中国共产党创建以来数十年间进行了肃清国内的封建军阀、反对日本帝国主义侵略军、消灭和驱逐蒋介石卖国匪帮以及美帝国主义侵略势力，其结果，使四亿七千五百万中国人民永远摆脱了侵略和压迫的枷锁。现中国人民解放军已壮大成强有力的保卫祖国的自由、独立、荣誉的百战百胜的武装力量，已成为对维护东方和平事业有极大贡献的伟大的军队。
    因此，不仅是中国人民，而且全世界劳动人民、被压迫民族及爱好和平的人民，都尊敬和高度赞颂着中国人民解放军。
    特别是和中国接境并有着悠久友谊关系的我们朝鲜人民，把中国人民及其强大的革命武装力量——中国人民解放军的伟大胜利看成自己的胜利，为之欢呼。
    我们还记得：中国人民早在三百五十余年以前，在我们朝鲜人民反对日本侵略者的祖国解放战争时期，援助了朝鲜人民，并在近世纪我祖国被日本侵略的时期，援助和支持了朝鲜人民。
    朝中两国人民的这种兄弟的联系，在抗日战争时期和中国人民伟大的解放战争时期，进一步地加强了。
    我们优秀的儿女在中国曾为中国人民的解放而奋不顾身地参加了斗争。
    这样从历史上结成的两国人民共同斗争的血缘联系和友谊关系，在朝鲜人民在自己敬爱的领袖金日成将军的领导下反对美帝国主义侵略者而斗争的伟大的祖国解放战争中，更加巩固起来了。
    中国人民在朝鲜人民面临着最困难时期派遣了自己的强大志愿部队，来援助了朝鲜人民。
    我们朝鲜人民永远不会忘记你们在援助我们朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略者的斗争中洒在我祖国国土上的高贵的鲜血和由于你们的英勇斗争而立下的英雄功勋，传至子孙万代，也将永远致于荣誉。
    由于伟大的斯大林所领导的苏联军队的武力而从日本帝国主义的统治下获得解放的朝鲜人民，已与中国人民结成兄弟般的友谊和坚强的团结，作为以全世界和平安全的堡垒——伟大的苏联为首的国际民主阵营的一部分，在保卫东方和平安全的事业中，成为永远不可被战胜的力量。
    胜利和光荣归于英雄的中国人民志愿军指挥员战斗员！
    伟大的中国人民志愿军指挥员战斗员万岁！伟大的中国人民解放军建军二十四周年纪念万岁！
    朝中两国人民永恒的兄弟般的战斗友谊团结万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖、中国人民解放军的创建者——毛泽东主席万岁！
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖、朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖、世界和平安全的旗帜伟大的斯大林大元帅万岁！
    【新华社三十一日讯】朝鲜民族保卫相崔镛健致电朱总司令，祝贺中国人民解放军建军节，电文如下：中国人民解放军总司令朱德将军：
    值此英勇的中国人民解放军建军二十四周年之际，我以全体朝鲜人民军指战员与我个人的名义，谨向阁下与全体中国人民解放军指战员们，致以兄弟的祝贺与最大的光荣。
    为消灭美帝国主义侵略者的伟大的祖国解放战争而奋起的全体朝鲜人民军指战员，被中国人民解放军在打倒国民党反动政权、击溃外来帝国主义者干涉的斗争中，所获得的历史性的胜利所鼓舞和激励，更巩固着对胜利的信心。
    为了巩固和平与安全，祝贺中国人民解放军的威力，今后更加强大并获得新的胜利。
          朝鲜民主主义人民共和国民族保卫相崔镛健
        一九五一年七月二十七日平壤
