　　Celebrating the "All-One" Army Day
    Cheng Qian

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been twenty-four years old since its birth in Nanchang on August 1, 1927. The people of the whole country are jubilant for the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's twenty-four years of struggle, and are enthusiastically celebrating the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Army Day. I would like to extend the most lofty salute to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army! I would like to extend the most lofty salute to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu who lead the Chinese People's Liberation Army! May the martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution in the Chinese People's Liberation Army be immortal!

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army has developed and grown under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao once pointed out the purpose of building the army, saying: "The reason why this army has strength is because all the people who participate in this army have conscious discipline. They are not for the private interests of a few people or narrow groups, but for the just people's war, for the interests of the broad masses of people, and for the interests of the entire nation, to unite and fight. Standing closely with the Chinese people and serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army." This fully illustrates that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, from the day it was founded, was a people's army connected with the people by flesh and blood. Because the Chinese People's Liberation Army has the leadership of Chairman Mao's Marxism-Leninism, it has been able to defeat more with less, and defeat the enemy's superior equipment with inferior equipment, and has been continuously developed in the struggle against powerful enemies. Its brilliant achievements in military affairs have today won unanimous respect and praise from the world.

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army is not a simple combat team, it is the backbone of the entire Chinese people's revolutionary cause in the past twenty-four years. In the past twenty-four years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has not only tempered itself into a powerful and invincible people's armed force, but also contributed a large number of extremely strong cadres in political, economic, and cultural aspects to the people's revolutionary cause. Just look at how rapidly the revolutionary and construction work in the two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China has progressed. When drinking water, think of the source. Which of these is not the fruit of the arduous and heroic armed struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the long past?

    Speaking only of military aspects, the achievements from last year's "August 1st" to this year's "August 1st" are also astonishing:

    (1) Due to the influence of the glorious tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers appeared. The heroic and good-at-fighting volunteers have repeatedly defeated the invading army of American imperialism, which has made the imperialist aggression group have to admit the strength and invincibility of the Chinese people's revolutionary forces, which has made the Korean issue have the hope of a peaceful solution.

    (2) The national defense strength of the People's Republic of China has been greatly strengthened. The widespread youth joining the army movement and the recent production increase and donation movement fully demonstrate the close cooperation between the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the cause of consolidating national defense.

    (3) Due to the heroic advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army into Tibet, the peaceful liberation of Tibet will soon be realized, and the liberation of the entire China except Taiwan will be completed.

    (4) Basically eliminated all bandits in the country. The banditry in western Hunan, which had never been eliminated in the history of Hunan, was completely eliminated in February this year. The notorious bandits in the history of Guangdong and Guangxi have now also been fundamentally eliminated.

    Along with these military victories, and with the support of military victories, the people of the whole country can let go of land reform, and can vigorously suppress counter-revolutionaries, which makes the people's democratic dictatorship increasingly consolidated. Through the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, all construction in the country has advanced by leaps and bounds, and the atmosphere in urban and rural areas across the country is thriving and completely new.

    Patriotic compatriots across the country! When celebrating the "August 1st" Army Day, let us unite and learn from the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Let us learn from their spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, learn from their spirit of heroic struggle and self-sacrifice, and learn from their pragmatic and good at contacting the masses style! Let us continue to work hard to enhance our national defense strength, earnestly do a good job in increasing production and donating, and preferential treatment work! Let us resolutely complete land reform, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, develop production and construction, and expand the fruits of our revolutionary victory! Let us shout: Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live Chairman Mao!

　　庆祝“全一”建军节
    程潜
    中国人民解放军自从一九二七年八月一日在南昌诞生，到现在已经二十四年了。全国人民都为中国人民解放军二十四年奋斗的辉煌胜利而欢欣鼓舞，都为中国人民解放军建军节而热烈庆祝。我愿在这里向中国人民解放军全体指战员致以最崇高的敬礼！向领导中国人民解放军的中国共产党和毛主席、朱总司令致以最崇高的敬礼！愿中国人民解放军中为革命而牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中国人民解放军是在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，发展和壮大起来的。毛主席曾指明建军的宗旨说：“这个军队之所以有力量，是因为参加这个军队的一切人们，具有自觉的纪律，他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着正义的人民战争，为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，这就是这个军队的唯一宗旨。”这就充分说明了中国人民解放军从建军之日起，就是与人民血肉相连的人民军队。中国人民解放军因为有毛主席的马克思列宁主义的领导，所以能够以少胜多，以劣势装备战胜敌人的优势装备，在反对强大敌人的斗争中得到不断的发展。它在军事上辉煌的成就，今日已经获得全世界一致的推崇和赞扬。
    中国人民解放军不是一支简单的作战的队伍，它是在二十四年来整个中国人民革命事业的主干。二十四年来，中国人民解放军不仅把自己锻炼成了一支强大无敌的人民武装力量，而且向人民革命事业贡献出了大批坚强无比的政治、经济、文化各方面的干部。试看中华人民共和国成立两年来的革命工作和建设工作进展得何等迅速，饮水思源，这一切有哪一点不是过去漫长的岁月中中国人民解放军艰苦卓绝的英勇武装斗争所结的果实？
    单说军事方面，从去年“八一”到今年“八一”这一年的成就也是惊人的：
    （一）由于中国人民解放军的光荣传统的影响，才出现了中国人民志愿军。英勇善战的志愿军，屡次打败美帝国主义的侵略军，这就使帝国主义侵略集团不得不承认中国人民革命力量的强大和不可战胜，这就使朝鲜问题有了和平解决的希望。
    （二）中华人民共和国的国防力量大大地加强了。广大的青年参军运动，最近的增产捐献运动，充分表现了中国人民与中国人民解放军在巩固国防的事业上的亲密合作。
    （三）由于中国人民解放军英勇地进军西藏，即将实现西藏的和平解放，并完成了除台湾外全中国的解放。
    （四）基本上肃清了全国所有的匪患。在湖南历史上从未肃清过的湘西匪患，在今年二月彻底肃清了。在两广历史上著名的土匪，现在也已根本肃清了。
    和这些军事上的胜利同时，并在军事胜利的支持之下，全国人民才得放手从事土地改革，才得大张旗鼓镇压反革命，这才使得人民民主专政日趋巩固。通过抗美援朝，土地改革，镇压反革命三大运动，全国一切建设无不突飞猛进，全国城乡的气象无不蓬蓬勃勃，焕然一新。
    全国的爱国同胞们！在庆祝“八一”建军节的时候，让我们团结一致，向中国人民解放军学习吧！学习他们全心全意地为人民服务的精神，学习他们英勇斗争，自我牺牲的精神，学习他们实事求是，善于联系群众的作风吧！让我们继续努力，增强我们的国防力量，认真做好增产捐献工作和优抚工作吧！让我们坚决完成土地改革，坚决镇压反革命，发展生产建设，扩大我们革命胜利的成果吧！让我们高呼：中国人民解放军万岁！中国共产党万岁！中华人民共和国万岁！毛主席万岁！
