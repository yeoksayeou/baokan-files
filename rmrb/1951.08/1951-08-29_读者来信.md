　　Reader's Letters
　　Hengyang Railway Bureau Laizhen Section Materials Factory
　　Leadership Cadres' Ideological Paralysis
　　Special Agents' Arson Causes Serious Losses
Comrade Editor:
　　At about 12 o'clock on the night of July 23rd, special agents lurking in Nanning City actually took advantage of the fact that the residents were all asleep and set fire near the Hengyang Railway Bureau Laizhen Section Materials Factory in Huabei Street, causing an explosion in the factory's explosives depot. This arson and explosion incident collapsed more than 470 civilian houses and railway worker dormitories, killing 18 people on the spot, leaving 7 missing after the explosion, and injuring 392 people. Statistics show that more than 1,700 residents and railway workers were affected; the property loss is difficult to estimate for the time being.
　　Since the Central People's Government promulgated the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," a vigorous struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries has been launched throughout the country. However, as this movement has developed to this day, a small number of cadres in individual regions have developed an incorrect idea: they believe that after this suppression, the arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries has been eliminated, and the consciousness of the masses has been greatly improved, so even if there are counter-revolutionaries, they are already "powerless." Therefore, they have developed a paralyzing and underestimating the enemy thinking of "let's take a breather."
　　The occurrence of the Nanning explosion is directly related to the ideological paralysis of the leading comrades of the Hengyang Railway Bureau Laizhen Section Materials Factory. The explosives depot was in a large courtyard, and the outside of the back wall was a small alley. The wall was only shoulder-high, making it easy to set fire. However, the depot only had a guard in front of the gate (quite far from the depot), and another armed comrade patrolled in front of the depot. No one was guarding the low wall. When the explosives were first delivered, a new guard leaked the news. Therefore, Ling Heling, chairman of the Huadong Street Farmers' Association who lived near the depot, raised his concerns to the person in charge of the depot, requesting them to move the explosives to another location for storage for safety. However, the person in charge of the depot did not accept this suggestion, neither moving the explosives nor strengthening the security, resulting in this tragic loss. This counter-revolutionary explosion occurred five or six days after the Nanning Military Control Commission sentenced a group of extremely heinous counter-revolutionaries. This proves that the counter-revolutionaries are not sleeping; they are still waiting for an opportunity to harm the people. Therefore, we must seriously accept this bloody lesson, improve our vigilance, and eliminate paralyzing thoughts.

　　Village Cadres in Various Areas of Western Liaoning Should Not Lead in Indiscriminate Logging
Comrade Editor:
　　Protecting forests is everyone's responsibility, but some cadres not only failed to fulfill this responsibility but instead led in indiscriminate logging or timber theft. For example, Wang Hongwen, secretary of the Communist Party branch, Zhan Fujin, village head, and Wang Jude, ward head, of the Erdaogou Village, Sixth District, Kaiyuan County, Western Liaoning Province, colluded to cut down public forests. Thirty-six people took the opportunity to indiscriminately log, cutting down more than 1,000 public trees. Cui Jingfeng, the finance and grain committee member of the Jianchang Village, Seventh District, falsely claimed that the public forests that had not been divided during land reform were already divided and divided the forest land into four sections, recruiting 30 people to carry out large-scale logging in a planned manner, cutting down more than 6,000 trees. Furthermore, the People's Government of Shuikouzi Village, Sixth District, Xingcheng County, indiscriminately felled 145 public trees for miscellaneous expenses. Even worse, Chen Wenhan, secretary of the Second District Government of the county, privately sold 372 confiscated timbers, obtaining 380,000 yuan for miscellaneous expenses and improving meals for the district government. The above all happened in the first half of this year. In the first half of this year, there were 125 incidents of indiscriminate logging or timber theft in Western Liaoning Province, of which 30% were caused by cadres leading the way. This phenomenon cannot be ignored. We suggest that the leading organs at all levels in Western Liaoning Province pay attention to this issue and strengthen patriotic ideological education on forest protection for district and village cadres.

　　Capitalist of Hangzhou Tiandetang Beats Apprentice to Death
　　Local Government Should Accept Mass Opinions and Severely Punish the Culprit
Comrade Editor:
　　Recently, an incident occurred in Hangzhou City in which a capitalist beat an apprentice to death. The details of this incident are as follows:
　　On August 9th, while Zhu Zhengsheng, an apprentice at the Tiandetang Chinese Medicine Store in Hangzhou, was decocting medicine in the store, Chen Huazhou, the small boss of the store, insisted that Zhu Zhengsheng help him prepare medicine. Zhu refused because he had work to do. Chen Huazhou immediately began to beat him and replaced his slippers with pointed leather shoes, kicking Zhu in the abdomen. Zhu fainted on the spot. At that time, the capitalist not only did not call a doctor for treatment but ran to the group leader of the trade association to falsely accuse Zhu Zhengsheng of disobeying orders. After the union's intervention, Zhu Zhengsheng was sent to the hospital, but he died at 4 p.m. that day due to injuries to vital organs.
　　Chen Huazhou himself held a puppet position in the Kuomintang's aviation school. After liberation, he was still unwilling to confess. Zhu Zhengsheng knew about this and exposed him once. Moreover, the store often evaded taxes by not keeping accounts and concealed assets that should have been declared and registered. Zhu Zhengsheng often reported these things. The capitalist of the store not only did not repent but instead harbored revenge and said to Zhu Zhengsheng, "I'll remember you!" Before liberation, the capitalist of the store beat Zhu Zhengsheng's eyes until they bled. Now, he dared to beat Zhu Zhengsheng to death. This incident has aroused the indignation of the broad masses of workers in Hangzhou City, who have demanded that the government severely punish the culprit. The store's union has received more than 500 letters expressing condolences and demanding severe punishment of the culprit.

    衡阳铁路局来镇段材料厂
    领导干部思想麻痹
    特务纵火造成严重损失编辑同志：
    七月二十三日夜十二时许，潜伏在南宁市的特务分子，居然乘居民均已入睡之际，在华北街衡阳铁路局来镇段材料厂附近纵火，并引起该厂炸药库的爆炸。这次纵火爆炸事件，共震塌民房及铁路职工宿舍四百七十余间，当场压死十八人，爆炸后失踪的七人，受伤的三百九十二人，统计受灾居民及铁路职工共一千七百多人；财产损失一时尚难计其数。
    自从中央人民政府颁布了《惩治反革命条例》以来，全国各地曾轰轰烈烈地展开了镇压反革命的斗争。但是，这个运动发展到今天，在个别的地区的少数干部中，却有了一种不正确的想法：他们认为经过这一番镇压，反革命的气焰已经消灭，群众的觉悟已大大提高，即有反革命也已经“无能为力”了，因此，就产生了“且喘一口气”的麻痹轻敌的思想。
    此次南宁爆炸案的发生，与衡阳铁路局来镇段材料厂领导同志思想麻痹就是有直接关联的。该炸药库是在一个大院子里，后围墙外面是一条小巷，墙只有一肩高，很容易纵火。但是该库只是在大门前（离库相当远）设一守卫人员，另在库前有一位武装同志巡逻，对于矮墙处却无人警卫。这次炸药刚运到之际，又给一位新来的看守人员把消息泄漏出来，因此，住在该库附近的华东街农会主席凌鹤龄，就向该库负责同志提出意见，请求他们把炸药搬到别地去保存，以求安全。但该库负责同志竟没有接受这个意见，既不转移收藏，又没有加强警卫，结果造成这次惨重的损失。这次反革命分子爆炸案，是在南宁市军事管制委员会判处了一批罪大恶极的反革命分子之后五六天的时间发生的，这证明反革命分子并没有睡觉，他们还在伺机谋害人民，因此我们必须认真地接受这次血的教训，提高警惕性，扫除麻痹思想。

  辽西各地区村干部不应带头滥伐林木编辑同志：
    保护森林是人人有责的，但某些干部不仅没有尽到这个责任，反而带头滥伐或盗伐林木。如辽西省开原县六区二道沟村中共支部书记王洪文、村长詹福金、闾长王居德三人合谋砍伐公有林，群众三十六人就乘机滥伐，共砍掉公有林木一千余棵；七区碱厂村财粮委员崔景峰将土地改革时未分的公有林，假作已分，将林地划分四段，拉拢群众三十人，有计划地进行大规模的砍伐，共砍掉林木六千多棵；又兴城县六区水口子村人民政府滥伐公有林木一百四十五棵作为杂项开支。还有更坏的是该县二区政府秘书陈文翰，竟将没收的三百七十二根木材私自出售，得款三十八万元作为区政府杂项开支和改善伙食的费用。以上都是今年上半年发生的事。今年上半年，辽西省发生滥伐或盗伐森林事件一百二十五起，其中由干部带头引起的即占百分之三十。这种现象是不可忽视的，我们建议辽西省各级领导机关重视这个问题，并对区村干部加强保护森林的爱国思想教育。

  杭州天德堂资方打死学徒
  当地政府应接受群众意见严惩凶犯编辑同志：
    最近杭州市发生了一件资方行凶打死学徒的事情，这件事情的经过如下：
    八月九日，杭州市天德堂国药店学徒朱正生正在店里煎药之际，该店小老板陈华洲硬要朱正生去帮他撮药。朱因自己有工作没有答应，陈华洲即开始毒打，并将拖鞋换作尖头皮鞋，猛踢朱之小腹，朱当场昏倒在地。当时资方不但不请医生救治，反跑至同业公会小组长处，诬告朱正生不听指挥。经工会交涉，将朱正生送往医院，但因伤在要害，结果不能医治，当天下午四时身死。
    陈华洲本人曾在国民党的航空学校充任伪职，解放后仍不愿坦白，朱正生知道这件事，有一次就把他揭发出来了。又该店常常以不记账的办法逃税，并隐瞒应申报登记的资财，朱正生又常常检举这些事情。该店资方对此不但不知悔改，反而存心报复，并对朱正生说：“我记住你！”。解放前，该店资方曾将朱正生眼睛打出血来，现在，竟敢将朱正生打死。这件事情已引起杭州市广大职工群众的愤慨，他们纷纷要求政府严惩凶犯。店员工会已收到五百多封来信，表示慰问并要求严惩凶犯。
