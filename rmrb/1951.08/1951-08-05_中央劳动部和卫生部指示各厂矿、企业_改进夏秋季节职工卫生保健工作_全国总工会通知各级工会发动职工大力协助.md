The Central People's Government's Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Health have jointly issued instructions to promote the importance and improvement of employee health and healthcare work during the summer and autumn seasons in state-owned and private factories and mines. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has also issued a notice to all levels of trade union organizations to assist in promoting this work.

Since the liberation of major cities, significant progress has been made in industrial and mining health and healthcare work due to continuous efforts from all sides. However, judging from last year's situation, the development of this work is extremely uneven. The sanitation work in many factories and mines, especially during the summer and autumn seasons, is still quite poor, and the incidence of illness is very high. In July of last year, 70 percent of the workers at the Qishuyan Railway Factory in Southern Jiangsu were ill. The number of patients at the Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory in Northern Jiangsu increased month by month from June to August last year: 6,655 in June, 9,100 in July, and 10,378 in August. In July of last year, the incidence of illness at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant accounted for 33 percent of the total number of employees. At the Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 12, out of a total of 4,389 workers and staff, there were 500 people on sick leave on one day in August last year due to the lack of proper ventilation equipment and excessively high temperatures. A survey of 832 employees at the Wafangdian Textile Factory in Northeast China found that as many as 759 were ill. Why is the incidence of illness so high? On the one hand, it is easy to contract diseases due to the hot weather; but on the other hand, it is because some factory and mine leaders have not started from the perspective of protecting workers' health and do not understand that doing a good job in production is inseparable from doing a good job in employee health and healthcare work, and therefore do not attach importance to health work.

Poor health and healthcare work not only endangers the physical health of workers and staff and affects production, but also increases a great burden on the administrative side or the capitalist. For example, according to the statistics of the Harbin Cloth Shoe Factory No. 2 for only three months, the wage subsidies and medical expenses paid due to employee illness amounted to 314.25 million yuan, and the production losses caused by these sick leaves were far more than this amount. Some units' leaders have attached importance to health work and improved sanitary conditions, which has not only greatly reduced the number of sick people, but also encouraged the production enthusiasm of workers and staff. For example, the Hangu Factory in Tianjin Special District improved its sanitary facilities, and the number of sick people decreased from an average of more than 80 per day in August to an average of 47 per day in September. The production rate of the bleaching powder department of the factory also increased by 27 percent in September compared with August.

The instructions from the Central People's Government's Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Health propose that state-owned and private factories and mines should prevent employee fatigue, thoroughly complete various infectious disease vaccinations, pay attention to the management and improvement of environmental sanitation, and strengthen dietary management. In short, it is necessary to establish the concept of "prevention first, treatment second." The so-called prevention is not simply carrying out epidemic prevention and injections, but should be combined with cleaning and sanitation to improve facilities. Health education should be carried out using cartoons, charts, blackboards, broadcasting, etc., so that every worker and staff member understands that diseases can be prevented. In order to make employee health work a regular task, factories and mines should establish a regular inspection system based on specific conditions in order to gradually improve sanitation facilities. Only in this way can we truly guarantee the physical health of workers and staff and ensure the smooth completion of production tasks.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has also issued a notice at the same time, instructing trade unions at all levels to discuss this issue at trade union meetings and formulate implementation methods based on local conditions. In addition to promoting the administrative side or the capitalist to improve necessary health and healthcare measures, it is also necessary to widely mobilize employees to put forward suggestions for improving sanitation work, and let employees solve some problems that can be solved without spending money or spending very little money on their own. A clean and sanitary movement should be launched in state-owned and private factories and mines to fight together to reduce the incidence of illness in the summer and autumn seasons and increase labor productivity.

　　中央劳动部和卫生部指示各厂矿、企业
    改进夏秋季节职工卫生保健工作
    全国总工会通知各级工会发动职工大力协助
    为促起国营、私营各厂矿、企业重视与改进夏秋间职工卫生保健工作，中央人民政府劳动部及卫生部特发出联合指示。中华全国总工会亦为此通知各级工会组织协助推进此项工作。
    各大城市解放以后，由于各方面不断努力，工矿卫生保健工作有了很大的进步。但是，从去年的情况看来，这一工作的发展是极不平衡的，有不少厂矿的卫生工作，尤其是夏秋季的卫生工作还相当差，患病率很高。去年七月份苏南戚墅堰铁路工厂有百分之七十的人患病。苏北南通大生纱厂病人从去年六月到八月逐月增加：六月份六千六百五十五人，七月份九千一百人，八月份一万零三百七十八人。太原钢铁厂去年七月份患病率占全体职工人数的百分之三十三。上海国营棉纺织十二厂在全厂工人职员四千三百八十九人中，因没有适当的通风设备，温度过高，去年八月份有一天请病假的就有五百人。东北瓦房店纺织厂曾检查了八百三十二名职工，其中有病的竟达七百五十九人。患病率为什么这样高呢？一方面由于天气酷热，容易感染疾病；但另一方面是由于某些厂矿领导干部没有从保护工人健康的观点上出发，不了解搞好生产是与搞好职工卫生保健工作分不开的，因此没有重视卫生工作。
    卫生保健工作做得不好，不但危害工人、职员的身体健康，影响生产，同时又会增加行政方面或资方很大负担。如哈尔滨布鞋二厂仅根据其三个月的统计，因职工患病所付的工资补助金、医药费就有三亿一千四百二十五万元，而这些病假所引起生产上的损失是远在此数以上的。有的单位领导干部重视了卫生工作，改善了卫生条件，不但病号大大地减少，而且鼓励了工人、职员的生产情绪。如：天津专区汉沽一厂改善了卫生设施，病号从八月份的每天平均八十多人减到九月份的平均每天四十七人。该厂漂粉部的生产率九月份也比八月份增产百分之二十七。
    中央人民政府劳动部和卫生部的指示提出：国营、私营各厂矿企业应防止职工疲劳，彻底完成各种传染病预防接种工作，注意环境卫生之管理及改进，加强膳食管理等，总之，是要树立预防为主、治疗为辅的观点。所谓预防，并不是单纯地进行防疫和注射，而应该与清洁卫生改善设施结合起来。并利用漫画、图表、黑板报、广播等进行卫生宣传教育，使每个工人与职员都懂得疾病是可以预防的。为了使职工卫生工作成为经常性的工作，应由各厂矿企业根据具体情况，建立定期检查制度，以期求得卫生设施的逐步改进。只有这样，才能真正保障工人职员的身体健康和保证生产任务的顺利完成。
    中华全国总工会亦同时发出通知，指示各级工会必须在工会会议上对这个问题加以讨论，并根据当地具体情况制订实行办法。除了推动行政方面或资方改进必要的卫生保健措施外，还须广泛发动职工提出改进卫生工作的意见，由职工自己动手解决一些不花钱或花钱不多就能解决的问题。在国营、私营各厂矿、企业中应展开清洁卫生运动，一致为减低夏秋季节的患病率和提高劳动生产率而斗争。
