　　All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles
    Sends Condolences on the Death of Prominent Korean Poet Cho Ki-chon
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The prominent Korean poet and Vice Chairman of the Korean Literary and Art General Alliance, Cho Ki-chon, unfortunately died in a barbaric air raid by American planes on July 30th. Upon hearing the news, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles sent a telegram of condolence on August 6th. The text of the telegram is as follows: To the Korean Literary and Art General Alliance:
    We are shocked to hear of the unfortunate death of the prominent Korean poet and Vice Chairman of the Korean Literary and Art General Alliance, Cho Ki-chon, and we express our deep sorrow!
    This famous poet shed his last drop of blood in resisting imperialist aggression and defending the motherland and world peace. His death is a major loss to the Korean literary and art circles. The death of the famous poet Cho Ki-chon comes at a time when the American representatives are loudly proclaiming "sincerity for peace" in the Korean armistice negotiations. This clearly demonstrates the true nature of the American imperialists' sincerity for a truce.
    We, the literary and art soldiers of China and Korea, love peace, but we are not afraid of war in order to oppose aggression. We will avenge our comrade Cho Ki-chon in the struggle to win the final victory in resisting America and aiding Korea. We, the literary and art soldiers of China and Korea, will stand more firmly on our battle lines and fight to the end!
    We swear to avenge Martyr Cho Ki-chon!
    Martyr Cho Ki-chon will live forever!
    Long live the victory of the Chinese and Korean people!
      All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles
    August 6th

　　我全国文学艺术界联合会
    电唁朝鲜著名诗人赵基天
    【本报讯】朝鲜著名诗人、朝鲜文学艺术总同盟副委员长赵基天在美机七月三十日的野蛮空袭中不幸罹难。中华全国文学艺术界联合会闻讯后，于八月六日特电致唁，电文如下：朝鲜文学艺术总同盟：
    惊闻朝鲜著名诗人，朝鲜文学艺术总同盟副委员长赵基天不幸罹难，我们表示沉痛的哀悼！
    这位名诗人在反抗帝国主义的侵略、保卫祖国和世界和平中流尽了最后一滴血。他的罹难是朝鲜文艺界的重大损失。名诗人赵基天的罹难，正是美国代表在朝鲜停战谈判中大喊“有和平诚意”的时候。这显然地也说明了美帝国主义的停战诚意究竟如何。
    我们中朝两国的文艺战士们热爱和平，但我们为了反对侵略决不怕战争。我们要在争取抗美援朝最后胜利的斗争中为我们的战友赵基天同志报仇。我们中朝两国文艺战士们将更加坚决地站在自己的战线上战斗到底！
    我们誓为赵基天烈士复仇！
    赵基天烈士永垂不朽！
    中朝人民胜利万岁！
      中华全国文学艺术界联合会
    八月六日
