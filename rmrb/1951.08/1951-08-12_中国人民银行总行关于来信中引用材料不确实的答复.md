    Reply from the Head Office of the People's Bank of China Regarding Inaccurate Materials Cited in Letter
    Editor:
    Our suggestion to change the names of streets named after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in various places, was published in the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily on May 30th. This was written by the personnel in charge based on reports from local branches. We received letters from the People's Governments of Lanxi, Lu'an, and Fenghua counties, informing us that the aforementioned places had already changed the names of streets or parks named after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits after liberation. However, we used them as examples in our letter of suggestion, which is inconsistent with the facts. Some branches did not conduct thorough investigations when reporting materials, exhibiting a careless style of work, and should be reviewed. We also express our apologies to the People's Governments of Lanxi, Lu'an, and Fenghua counties.
                                        Head Office of the People's Bank of China

### 中国人民银行总行关于来信中引用材料不确实的答复

　　中国人民银行总行关于来信中引用材料不确实的答复
    编辑同志：
    五月三十日人民日报《读者来信专页》刊载了我们关于更改各地以蒋匪为名的街道名称的建议。这是经办人员根据各地分支行的报告材料所写。我们接到兰溪、六安、奉化三县人民政府来信，知道上述各地在解放后已经改掉以蒋匪为名的街道或公园的名字，而我们在建议信中还提出他们作例子，这是不符合事实的。某些分支行在报告材料时未经认真调查，有粗枝大叶作风，应进行检讨。我们并向兰溪、六安、奉化三县人民政府致歉。
                                        中国人民银行总行
