Our Great Motherland

Today is the second anniversary of the liberation of Ganzhou, a military and commercial center in southern Jiangxi. Ganzhou is located in the upper reaches of the Gan River in Jiangxi, where the Zhang and Gong Rivers converge, and the main routes to Fujian and Guangdong pass through here. This is the Ganjiang Bridge across the Gan River, built by the workers of Ganzhou in sixty-five days after liberation.

    我们伟大的祖国
    今天是江西南部军事和商业重镇赣州解放的二周年纪念。赣州在江西赣江上游，章水和贡水在这里汇合，通往福建和广东的要道都经过这里。这是横跨赣江的赣江大桥，是解放后的赣州工人在六十五天内造成的。
