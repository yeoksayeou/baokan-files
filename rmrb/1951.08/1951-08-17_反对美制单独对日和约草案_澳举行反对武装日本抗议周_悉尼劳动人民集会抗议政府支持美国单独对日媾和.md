Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, August 16th, TASS Sydney, August 14th: The "National Patriotic Protest Week Against the Rearmament of Japan," initiated by the Committee Against the Rearmament of Japan, began in Australia on August 12th. In the past few days, working people in Sydney have held many mass rallies. Speakers at the rallies called on the people to actively collect signatures for the Committee Against the Rearmament of Japan's declaration and to protest the Australian government's support for the US-drafted separate peace treaty with Japan. Before the start of "Protest Week," approximately 40,000 Australians had signed the declaration.

The Communist Party of Australia is at the forefront of the movement protesting the US imperialists' rearmament of Japan, linking this movement with the struggle for peace and the defeat of the anti-communist plebiscite that the Australian government will hold in September. The movement against the rearmament of Japan and the movement against the US-drafted separate peace treaty with Japan are increasingly gaining the support of the Australian people.

The Australian Council of Trade Unions has called on all union members to sign the declaration protesting the rearmament of Japan and to hold a two-minute strike across the country on August 15 (the day Japan announced its unconditional surrender) to commemorate those who sacrificed their lives in the fight against Japanese imperialism and to protest the US-drafted separate peace treaty with Japan and the Australian government's support for this draft treaty.

Electrical Trades Union representative Anderson said in a speech at the Council of Trade Unions meeting: We must protest against the attempts by the Americans to drag us into a new war. Anderson pointed out: Australia is about to become the forty-ninth state of the United States. He called for intensified struggle for national independence.

　　反对美制单独对日和约草案
    澳举行反对武装日本抗议周
    悉尼劳动人民集会抗议政府支持美国单独对日媾和
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社悉尼十四日讯：反对重新武装日本委员会所发起的“全国反对武装日本爱国抗议周”，于八月十二日在澳大利亚开始。这几天以来，劳动人民在悉尼举行许多次群众大会，演说者在大会上号召人民积极为反对重新武装日本委员会的宣言征集签名，并抗议澳大利亚政府支持美国单独对日和约草案。在“抗议周”开始以前，就有四万名左右的澳大利亚人在这个宣言上签了名。
    澳大利亚共产党在抗议美帝国主义者重新武装日本的运动中是站在前列的，它把这个运动和为和平而斗争与击败澳大利亚政府将在九月间举行的反共的公民投票两件事联系起来。抗议重新武装日本的运动和抗议美国单独对日和约草案的运动，日益获得澳大利亚人民的拥护。
    澳大利亚工会理事会号召全体工会会员在抗议重新武装日本的宣言上签名，并于八月十五日（日本宣布无条件投降的一天）在各地举行两分钟的罢工，以纪念在对日本帝国主义者作战中牺牲的人们，并抗议美国单独对日和约草案，抗议澳大利亚政府支持这个和约草案。
    电力工人工会代表安德逊在工会理事会会议中演说时说：我们对美国人把我们拖入新战争的企图必须提出抗议。安德逊指出：澳大利亚马上就要变成美国的第四十九州了。他号召加紧为民族独立而斗争。
