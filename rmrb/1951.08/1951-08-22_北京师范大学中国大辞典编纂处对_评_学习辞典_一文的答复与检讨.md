　　We edited the book "Learning Dictionary," viewing it from the perspective of serving society, merely as a tool to meet the urgent needs of general learning at present; viewing it from the perspective of completing the professional task of the Grand Dictionary Office, it is an advance trial compilation of a portion of the materials for the "Chinese Grand Dictionary." This has already been described in the book's preface.

　　Precisely because it was intended to meet urgent needs, we felt pressed for time in editing and printing; precisely because it was a trial compilation of materials, many aspects of the content and format were not yet mature. Therefore, we dare not say that this book can satisfy readers' hopes for learning and checking, and the correctness and completeness of the content are often insufficient. We earnestly hoped for readers' criticism and assistance. This was also mentioned in the preface.

　　After this book was published, the general feedback from readers was that, at the current stage, the "Learning Dictionary" is basically a more correct tool book, which provides certain help to readers. However, we are aware of our insufficient academic ability and political level, and we have not been able to implement the goals we set; limited by time, we have not been able to go into deep and meticulous work; limited by materials, the content is often lacking. Therefore, in the past two months, we have checked the entire book, trying to find errors, omissions, and inappropriate points in proofreading and explanations, and written a relatively detailed table of corrections and supplements. At the same time, many readers, with the attitude of cherishing this book, have raised some questions to us, pointed out some errors, and provided some materials. In addition to expressing our gratitude and acceptance, we have also made appropriate replies and explanations. This is the help that readers have given us, making it possible for the "Learning Dictionary" to gradually improve. And this book must be gradually modified and perfected before it can be of greater help to readers. Based on this premise, we have decided to temporarily suspend reprinting and first conduct a thorough revision; for purchasers of the first edition, in addition to printing and giving away the aforementioned table of corrections and supplements, we will offer preferential treatment when the re-edited edition (1952 edition) is published.

　　On July 20th, the "Cultural Life" column of the People's Daily published a critique of the "Learning Dictionary," pointing out the errors and shortcomings in this book. In our view, this article, like the aforementioned readers' letters, is of the nature of helping us, so we also express our gratitude and accept the criticism. Some of the errors pointed out in the critique had already been discovered in our inspection or pointed out by readers. We have also begun to modify some that have not been pointed out, and selectively include them in the table of corrections and supplements. We are determined to carefully check and revise this book, so as not to fail everyone's kind intentions of love and assistance.

　　Secondly, the critical article and some readers' opinions pointed out that we have "serious influence of objectivism," and we also fully accept this. We analyze: None of the editors and staff in our office are not striving to overcome the influence of old ideas and pursue progress, and are willing to dedicate all their strength to the revolution; but because learning is still in the initial stage, we often fail to stand firm in the face of concrete things, and old baggage still remains more or less in our minds. When editing the "Learning Dictionary," we underestimated our task too lightly and unseriously; at the same time, we overestimated our abilities too highly, and as a result, we could not reach a higher standard.

　　Thanks to the multi-faceted help of the masses, which has given us great inspiration and guidance, we must work harder to overcome practical difficulties, and are determined to strengthen learning and thoroughly eliminate the old influences, so as to improve our dictionary business and better serve the people.

Editor's Note: After the "Learning Dictionary" was published, we received many letters from readers, raising opinions about it, and also received several critical articles. We published an article written by Comrade Wang Dabai, pointing out some major errors in this dictionary. Generally speaking, compared with dictionaries of the same nature published before, this dictionary should be considered better, and the editorial attitude is also more serious. However, due to the fact that the working methods are not yet scientific enough and the theoretical cultivation is not yet mature, there are still many shortcomings and errors in both the format and the explanations. The self-criticism made by the Chinese Grand Dictionary Compilation Office and the corrective measures decided to be taken are very good. We hope that after careful revision, this book will be able to meet the requirements of general readers.

### 北京师范大学中国大辞典编纂处对“评‘学习辞典’”一文的答复与检讨

　　北京师范大学中国大辞典编纂处对“评‘学习辞典’”一文的答复与检讨
    我们编辑“学习辞典”一书，若从服务社会这一点来看，只是勉应目前一般学习上急切需要的工具书；若从完成大辞典处的专业任务来看，它是“中国大辞典”一部分材料的提前试编。这在该书的序文中都已叙述过了。
    惟其是要应急需，编印的时间就感到迫促；惟其是材料的试编，内容和体例就有不少地方未臻成熟。因此这部书实在不敢说能满足读者学习检查的希望，内容的正确性和充实性也多不够，一切企盼读者批评和协助。这在序文中也都说到。
    这部书出版以后，读者的一般反映是：在目前阶段，“学习辞典”基本上还是一部较为正确的工具书，对于读者有一定的帮助。不过我们自知学力和政治水平不足，所悬的目标没有能够贯彻；又限于时间，未能深入细作，限于材料，内容每多欠缺。所以两月以来，我们已经把全书检查了一遍，尽量寻出校对上、解释上的错误、遗漏和不妥的地方，写成了一个较详的勘误订补表。同时许多读者也以爱护这部书的态度，向我们提出一些问题，指出一些错误，供给一些材料，我们除感谢和接受以外，也酌量作了答复和说明。这是读者给我们的帮助，使“学习辞典”有可能逐渐提高。而这部书必须在一步步修改完善以后，才有可能对读者作更大的帮助。在这个前提下，我们决定暂不续印，先作彻底的修订；对于初版的购者，除印赠前述的勘误订补表外，俟再版（一九五二年本）出书时，并予优待。
    七月二十日人民日报“文化生活”栏发表了对“学习辞典”的批评，指出了这部书中的错误和缺点。在我们看，这篇文章和上述读者的来信同是帮助我们的性质，所以我们同样表示感谢，并接受批评。批评文中指出的错误有一部分在我们检查时已经发现或已由读者指出，另外还有一些未经指出的，我们也都着手修改，并择要编入勘误订补表。我们决心对这书认真检查，认真修订，以不负大家爱护协助的盛意。
    其次，批评文章以及若干读者意见指出我们存在着“严重的客观主义思想影响”，我们也完全接受。我们分析：我处编辑工作人员没有一个人不在努力克服着旧思想影响而追求进步，愿为革命献出全部力量；但是由于学习尚在初步阶段，在具体事物面前每每站不稳立场，思想中旧包袱仍然或多或少地残存。编辑“学习辞典”时，把自己的任务估量得太轻，太不严肃；同时又把自己的能力估得太高，结果却达不到较高的标准。
    由于群众的多方面的帮助，给我们极大的启发、指导，使我们更要努力克服实际的困难，决意加强学习，彻底排除旧影响，以便把我们的辞典业务提高一步，更好地为人民服务。

                编者按：“学习辞典”出版后，我们曾接到不少读者来信，对它提出意见，也收到几篇批评文字。我们发表了王大白同志所写的一篇，指出了这部辞典中若干重大的错误。大体说来，和以前出版的同性质的辞书相比较，这部辞典应算是较好的，编辑态度也比较认真。但是由于工作方法还不够科学化，理论修养尚欠成熟，以致在体例上和解释上都还存在着不少缺点和错误。中国大辞典编纂处所作的检讨以及决定采取的改正办法都很好。我们希望这本书经过认真修订以后，能够适应一般读者的要求。
