Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 24th: Our correspondent reports the following details regarding the incident of U.S. aircraft bombing the residential area of our negotiation representatives in Kaesong:

At 22:20 on the 22nd, U.S. aircraft suddenly intruded into the airspace above the conference area, circling five times before dropping bombs twice and strafing once, then fleeing in a southeastern direction.

When the U.S. aircraft suddenly bombed and strafed, nearby residents awoke from their sleep and rushed to air raid shelters. The reporter witnessed the light of the explosions outside the window and heard shrapnel whistling through the night sky. A piece of shrapnel landed in front of a sentry on the left side of the reporter's room, and the smell of gunpowder filled the air.

After the incident, our delegation's liaison officer immediately notified the U.S. delegation's liaison officer at 22:35 that night to come and conduct a joint investigation. U.S. Liaison Officers Colonel Kinney and Colonel Mulray, accompanied by two translators, arrived at the designated location at 0:25 on the 23rd and immediately went to the bombing site to investigate.

The investigation revealed that the enemy aircraft dropped a total of nine bombs in two waves, six of which were fragmentation bombs and three were incendiary bombs. Fragmentation bomb shrapnel landed about 100 meters north of the residence of our delegation's armistice negotiation representatives, and even hit the representatives' residence and General Nan Ri’s car parked in front of the door. One incendiary bomb landed on the road leading from the negotiation conference venue to the U.S. delegation's dormitory. There was a bomb crater two meters to the right of the road, and the burnt shell lay on the road surface. The other two incendiary bombs landed on the hillside one kilometer west of the helicopter airport. One of them exploded and burned, destroying nearby seedlings; the other exploded but did not burn, and its shrapnel and gasoline remained near the bomb crater. The above investigation results show that this enemy air raid was clearly a planned act of sabotage, with the residential area of our delegation as the main target. Since the beginning of the negotiations, the Kaesong conference area has been brightly lit at night and easy to identify. Obviously, the U.S. cannot escape its responsibility by claiming it was an accidental bombing. In addition, at about 10:00 on the morning of the 22nd, a U.S. fighter plane flew from the Panmunjom direction along the U.S. representative's helicopter route to reconnaissance over the conference venue, then flew north along the conference venue. This was clearly preparation for the night air raid. The enemy aircraft's bombing route at night was the same as the reconnaissance route during the day, which is another proof.

When investigating this bombing incident, the U.S. liaison officers, as in the investigation of the Yao Qingxiang murder case, adopted the same old tricks of perfunctory behavior and cunning excuses. When our liaison officer was ordered to urge the U.S. liaison officer to come and conduct a joint investigation, the U.S. liaison officer initially made excuses for the late hour, repeatedly prevaricating and unwilling to come to the scene of the incident to investigate. Then, during the investigation process, they repeatedly engaged in hooligan tactics, deliberately denying the U.S.’s criminal acts. When they inspected the third bomb crater, they refused to continue the investigation. Our liaison officers, Colonel Zhang Chunshan and Lieutenant Colonel Chai Chengwen, immediately rebuked them sternly: "We have the right to demand that you continue the investigation." The U.S. liaison officers reluctantly continued the investigation, but still raised many ridiculous questions, attempting to evade responsibility. For example, even though there was much physical evidence, they asked: "You say there was bombing, do you have any witnesses?" Even though it was nighttime, they asked: "How many engines did you see on the bomber?" Most laughably, when inspecting one bomb crater, there were clearly bomb fins in the crater, but after they picked them up and looked at them, they shamelessly said: "Anyone who has seen a bomb will not believe that this is a bomb." This Air Force colonel was so brazen in making false statements and confusing right and wrong that his shamelessness and rascality had reached an astonishing level. When inspecting the two incendiary bombs on the western slope of the airport, even though the evidence was conclusive, they shamelessly asked our liaison officer: "Is this an incendiary bomb?" Our liaison officer immediately pressed them severely: "Is this a children's toy?" Unable to argue, the other side then made excuses that it was dark and raining and they couldn't see clearly, in order to evade responsibility for the investigation. Our liaison officer saw through their plot to use the rain to wash away the evidence and immediately exposed it. Our liaison officer solemnly declared to the U.S. liaison officer: "I must point out the extreme seriousness of this matter. I am instructed by our chief representative to lodge the most serious protest with you orally. I also notify you that all meetings on the 23rd will be suspended, and our side reserves the right to make all demands." This joint investigation ended at 3:15 a.m. on the 23rd.

This morning, our side conducted another inspection of the bombing site and discovered more bomb fins. The military police guarding the conference area also collected many machine gun shells from the enemy aircraft strafing. Our side has photographed this evidence.

### 美机轰炸开城中立区及双方联络官调查详情

　　美机轰炸开城中立区及双方联络官调查详情
    【新华社开城二十四日电】本社记者报告，美国飞机轰炸开城我方谈判代表住宅区事件的经过如下：
    二十二日二十二时二十分，突有美机侵入会议地区上空，先后盘旋五周，投弹两次，扫射一次，然后向东南方向逸去。
    当美机突然轰炸与扫射时，附近居民从酣睡中惊醒，纷纷奔向防空洞躲避。记者目睹炸弹在窗外爆炸的火光，听到弹片在夜空嘶叫，一块弹片落在记者住室左侧一位哨兵的身前，火药味扑鼻而来。
    事件发生后，我方代表团联络官即于当夜二十二时三十五分通知美方代表团联络官前来会同调查，美方联络官肯尼上校、穆莱上校偕翻译二人，二十三日零时二十五分到达指定地点，随即同赴落弹处调查。
    调查结果，发现敌机两次共投掷炸弹九枚，其中六枚系杀伤弹，三枚为燃烧弹。在我方停战谈判代表团住址以北百米左右处，以至代表团住宅及停放于门前的南日将军的坐车内，均落有杀伤弹弹片。有一枚燃烧弹落在谈判会议会场通往美方代表团宿舍的公路上，公路右侧两米处有一弹坑，已燃烧的弹壳落于路面。另两枚燃烧弹落在直升飞机机场以西千米外的高地山坡上，其中一个已爆炸燃烧，附近秧苗被毁；另一个爆炸后末燃烧，其弹片与汽油体仍保持在弹坑附近。上述调查结果表明：此次敌机空袭，显系有计划的破坏行为，且以我方代表团住宅地区为主要目标。因自谈判开始以来，开城会议地区夜间灯火辉煌，极易辨认，显然美方绝不能借口误炸而逃避其责任。加之，二十二日上午十时许，曾有美方战斗机一架沿美方代表直升飞机航行路线自板门店方向飞来会场上空侦察，然后沿会场北上飞去，这很明白的是为夜间空袭预作准备。敌机在夜间的轰炸路线即系白昼的侦察路线，这是另一个证明。
    美方联络官在调查此次轰炸事件时，与在调查杀害姚庆祥事件中一样，采取了敷衍狡猾等故技。当我方联络官奉命促请美方联络官前来会同调查时，美方联络官初则借口夜深，再三推诿，不愿前来出事地点调查；继则在调查过程中一再玩弄流氓手段，居心抵赖美方的罪恶行为。当察勘到第三个弹坑时，他们即不愿继续调查下去。我方联络官张春山上校、柴成文中校立即严词加以斥责：“我们有权利要你们调查下去。”美方联络官才勉强地调查下去，但仍提出许多可笑的问题，企图推卸罪责。例如明明有许多实物罪证，他们却问：你们说轰炸，有人证没有？明明是黑夜，但他们却问：你看见轰炸机有几个发动机？最可笑的是，在察勘一个弹坑时，弹坑中明明存有弹翅，但在他们拿起来看了看之后，居然卑鄙无耻地说：“见过炸弹的人是不会相信这是炸弹的。”这个空军上校如此信口雌黄，混淆黑白，其无耻无赖，已达到惊人的地步。在勘察机场西坡地上的两个燃烧弹时，明明罪证确凿，他们却无耻地反问我方联络官：“这是燃烧弹吗？”我方联络官随即严厉追问：“难道这是儿童玩具吗？”对方无法诡辩，又借口天黑下雨看不清楚，逃避调查责任。我方联络官洞察对方企图借雨水冲刷罪证的阴谋，立即予以揭破。我方联络官向美方联络官郑重宣告：“我必须指出这件事的绝大严重性，我奉我方首席代表之命，向你方先在口头提出最严重的抗议：并通知你：二十三日一切会议停开，我方保留提出一切要求的权利。”此次的会同调查于二十三日晨三时十五分结束。
    今晨我方又在被炸地点进行察看，发现了更多的弹翅。我警卫会场地区的军事警察并检得敌机扫射之机关炮弹壳多枚。我方已将这些罪证摄成照片。
