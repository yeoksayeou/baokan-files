    A Family Letter
    Written by Liang Yulong
  (X) Our whole family held a family meeting specifically to support the volunteer army in Korea and adopted a patriotic pact. Your eldest brother is going into the mountains tomorrow to build the highway from Guanxian to Maoxian. He said, "If our fourth brother becomes a combat hero at the front, then I will strive to be a road-building model in the rear!"
  (XI) This time the Farmers' Association and the county government sent us two hundred catties of oil cake, two hundred catties of rations, and many farm tools.
  (XII) Your second and third brothers have both guaranteed to do careful and meticulous farming, apply more fertilizer, and make the nine mu of land yield two hundred and seventy more catties of grain. We are also prepared to donate a portion of the grain to contribute to airplanes and cannons.

  （十）我们全家为了支援朝鲜的志愿军，特地开了个家庭会议，订了爱国公约。你大哥明天就要进山去修灌县到茂县的公路，他说：“老四在前方当了战斗英雄，我在后方要争取当一个筑路模范！”
  （十一）这回农会和县政府给我们送来二百斤油枯，二百斤口粮和不少的农具。
  （十二）你二哥三哥都保证做到精耕细作，多施肥料，使九亩田多收二百七十斤谷子。我们还准备抽出一部分谷子来捐献飞机大炮。
