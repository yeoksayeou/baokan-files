Yunnan Gejiu Tin Mine New Factory
Abolishes the Feudal Ba Tou System

Following the implementation of democratic reforms and the abolition of the feudal Ba Tou system at the Gejiu Tin Mine New Factory, affiliated with the Yunnan Tin Industry Company, workers' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased.

Before liberation, the workers of this factory were subjected to the cruel rule of labor contractors and foremen, who were raised by bureaucratic capital. The labor contractors and foremen were the heads of reactionary feudal organizations such as gangs and brotherhoods within the factory, and most of them were special agents who had repeatedly sabotaged the workers' movement in the factory. They consistently used instruments of torture such as whips, wooden sticks, and shackles to supervise workers in ore extraction and carrying, often resorting to vicious abuse and beatings. Over three hundred workers alone suffered beatings by the special agent labor contractor, Niu Xingguang. The feudal Ba Tou also exploited the workers through usury, wage deductions, and bribery, with interest rates on loans to workers as high as 30%. After liberation, due to the serious bureaucratic style of the factory's administrative leaders, the unreasonable feudal Ba Tou system was not thoroughly reformed. Special agents and Ba Tou still held real power in grassroots production management and used feudal gang forces to seize leadership of the trade union. Two-thirds of the three grassroots trade union committee members and nine trade union group leaders in the first mining team were special agents and Ba Tou. Not only did they continue to oppress the workers, but they also frequently sabotaged production. They used methods such as expulsion and denial of trade union membership to suppress active production workers, secretly coercing workers to produce more stone waste and less ore during mining, and forcing workers to violate safe operating procedures, resulting in repeated casualties and serious production losses.

In February of this year, the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, dispatched a work team to the factory to help mobilize the workers and carry out the struggle against the feudal Ba Tou. Throughout the democratic reform process, the work team focused on ideological mobilization of the workers. They first convened mobilization meetings, addressing the workers' concerns about retaliation from the Ba Tou, explaining in detail the significance of democratic reform, and guaranteeing their full support for the workers. Subsequently, the work team immediately focused on educating active members in each workshop, helping them form anti-feudal groups, and through them, mobilizing and persuading the suffering workers to rise up and participate in the struggle. The work team also won over workers who had been coerced into participating in reactionary organizations by the feudal Ba Tou, thereby isolating the few leading offenders and enabling 90% of the workers to participate in the struggle, greatly increasing the workers' confidence in defeating the feudal forces. After the feudal Ba Tou were overthrown, each workshop immediately convened a workers' representative meeting to discuss issues such as dealing with feudal remnants, abolishing the labor contractor and foreman system, and reorganizing the trade union. The factory administration fully supported the workers' opinions, and special agents and feudal remnants were dealt with according to their respective circumstances.

After the abolition of the feudal Ba Tou system, the workers' sense of responsibility as masters of their own destiny has greatly increased, and their enthusiasm for production has soared to unprecedented heights. The Zhou Wenchang group in the first mining team, which used to produce only five or six carts of ore per day, created a record of twenty-two carts per day in May. The Deng Lieguang group completed its June production task on June 14, ahead of schedule. The factory's production tasks for each month of the second quarter were overfulfilled by 8% to 22%, with production volume increasing by more than 40% compared to before February.

### 云南个旧锡矿新厂  废除封建把头制度

　　云南个旧锡矿新厂
    废除封建把头制度
    云南锡业公司所属个旧锡矿新厂实行民主改革，废除封建把头制度后，工人生产积极性大为提高。
    该厂解放前，工人们一直受着官僚资本豢养的领工、工目的残酷统治。领工、工目是厂内帮会、兄弟会等反动封建组织的头子，其中绝大部分并且是多次破坏该厂工人运动的特务分子。他们一贯使用皮鞭、木棍、脚镣等刑具押管工人开塃（塃即矿石）、背塃，动辄施以恶骂毒打。单是遭受特务分子领工牛星光毒打的工人，就在三百人以上。封建把头们更以放高利贷、强扣工资、送礼等方式对工人进行苛重盘剥，向工人放债的利息竟高达三十分。解放后，由于该厂行政领导干部存在着严重的官僚主义作风，以致不合理的封建把头制度一直没有彻底改革，特务、把头仍然掌握基层生产管理的实权，并利用封建帮会势力窃取了工会领导权。采矿第一队三个基层工会委员、九个工会小组长中，有三分之二是特务、把头。他们不但继续压迫工人，并且经常破坏生产。他们以开除、不许加入工会等方式来打击生产积极分子，暗中要挟工人在开塃时多出石渣少出塃；强迫工人违反操作安全规程，致迭次造成伤亡事故和生产上的严重损失。
    今年二月，云南省总工会鉴于上述情况之严重，特派遣工作队到该厂帮助发动工人，进行反封建把头的斗争。工作队在整个民主改革过程中，曾着重于对工人群众的思想发动。他们首先召开动员大会，针对工人群众怕把头分子报复的思想顾虑，详细解释民主改革的意义，保证给工人撑腰到底。随后，工作队即抓紧教育各工房的积极分子，帮助他们组成反封建小组，并通过他们动员说服受苦的工友起来参加斗争。工作队还通过积极分子把过去为封建把头所胁迫参加过反动组织的工人争取过来，从而孤立了少数首恶分子，使百分之九十的工人参加斗争，大大增强了工人们对于打垮封建势力的信心。在封建把头被斗垮后，各工房随即召开职工代表会议，讨论处理封建残余分子、废除领工、工目制度以及整顿工会组织等问题。工厂行政上完全支持工人意见，对特务分子和封建残余分子均按不同情况分别作了处置。
    封建把头制度废除后，该厂工人的主人翁责任感已大为提高，生产热情空前高涨。采矿第一队周文昌小组，过去每天只出五、六车塃，五月份即创造了每天出二十二车的最高纪录。邓烈光小组六月份的生产任务，在六月十四日即提前完成。全厂第二季各月的生产任务，均超额百分之八到百分之二十二完成，生产量较二月份以前提高了百分之四十以上。
