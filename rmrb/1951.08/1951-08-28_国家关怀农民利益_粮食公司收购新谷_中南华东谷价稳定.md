　　State Cares for Farmers' Interests
    Grain Companies Purchase New Grain, Central South and East China Grain Prices Stabilize
    Early rice has had a bumper harvest in the Central South region. State-owned grain companies in Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei and other provinces have been vigorously purchasing since mid-July. The average purchase volume in various regions has reached about half of the market supply. Timely purchases have eliminated the phenomenon of falling prices of new grain in some areas. At present, except for some areas in Guangdong Province where the market price of early rice is still lower than the purchase price of state-owned grain companies, the listed prices and market prices in Jiangxi, Hunan and other provinces have become consistent. When purchasing early rice, state-owned grain companies in Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong and other places have adopted various methods to provide as much convenience as possible to farmers. In addition to widely dispatching mobile purchasing teams to expand the scope of purchases, grain companies in various regions have also entrusted other state-owned trading companies and cooperatives to make purchases. At the same time as purchasing, grain companies and other trading companies in various regions are working together to transport materials to supply farmers. The Central South Grain Company and the Central South Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company signed a cooperation contract in mid-August, whereby the grain company is responsible for transporting grain to cotton-producing areas in Hubei, Henan and Hunan provinces before September. The amount of grain transported will be equivalent to 30 percent of the total value of cotton purchased by the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, in order to ensure the grain supply for the vast cotton-producing areas from September to December.
    State-owned trading companies in East China promptly purchased new grain, and grain prices in various regions have remained stable. As of August 21, state-owned grain companies throughout the region had purchased 85 million jin of new grain.
    This year, the early rice harvest in East China increased by 10 to 20 percent compared to last year, and the time of market availability was also earlier than in previous years. For example, new grain in Zhejiang Province was the first to be marketed in late July. In early August, new grain in Southern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Southern Anhui and Northern Jiangsu was also heavily on the market. Thanks to the early preparations made by state-owned companies and cooperatives, and the large-scale purchases carried out simultaneously in urban and rural areas when the new grain was launched, the phenomenon of excessive price differences between urban and rural areas and falling market prices was quickly changed. For example, when early rice was launched in Taizhou, Zhejiang Province on July 27, the market price of old grain fell to 440 yuan per jin that afternoon. After state-owned grain companies made large-scale purchases, the grain price in the area rebounded to 500 yuan per jin three days later, which was completely consistent with the listed price. Grain prices in other regions have also been basically stabilized within a few days of being launched on the market.
    State-owned trading companies and cooperatives near cotton-producing areas prepared grain for cotton farmers when purchasing new grain and organized short-distance transportation in a planned manner.
    After selling grain, farmers in East China purchased large quantities of production materials such as agricultural tools, fertilizers, and ploughing cattle. The Yuyao Native Products Company in Zhejiang Province sold 46,280 jin of fertilizer powder and more than 780,000 jin of bean cake in about ten days after the early rice was launched. Farmers in Shanghua Village, Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, bought three ploughing cattle, 577 various iron agricultural tools, and a large number of bamboo and wood implements after selling grain. Autumn grain is now being harvested in various regions. State-owned trading companies and cooperatives at all levels are continuing to transport materials and set up more organizations to meet the needs of grain purchasing.

　　国家关怀农民利益
    粮食公司收购新谷  中南华东谷价稳定
    中南区各地早稻丰收，广东、湖南、江西、湖北等省国营粮食公司自七月中旬起已开始大力收购。各地收购数量平均约达上市量的一半。及时的收购工作，已消除了部分地区新谷跌价现象。现在除广东省某些地区早稻市价还低于国营粮食公司的收购牌价外，江西、湖南等省的牌价、市价已趋一致。湖南、江西、广东等地国营粮食公司在收购早稻时，采取各种办法，尽量使农民获得便利。各地粮食公司除广泛派出流动收购小组以扩大收购面外，并委托各地其他国营贸易公司和合作社收购。和收购同时，各地粮食公司及其他贸易公司正协力调运物资，供应农民。中南区粮食公司已和中南区花纱布公司在八月中旬签订了联系合同，由粮食公司负责在九月份以前向湖北、河南、湖南三省产棉区调运粮食，其数目相等于花纱布公司购棉总值的百分之三十，以保证广大棉区九月至十二月的粮食供应。
    华东区国营贸易公司及时收购新谷，各地新谷价格平稳。全区国营粮食公司到八月二十一日止已收购新谷八千五百万斤。
    今年华东区各地早稻比去年增收一成到二成，上市时间也比往年早，如浙江省新谷七月下旬最先上市，八月初，苏南、皖北、皖南、苏北等地新谷都大量登场。由于国营公司和合作社及早作了准备，并在新谷上市时就在城市和乡村同时进行大量收购，各地新谷城乡差价过大和市价下跌的现象，得以迅速改变。如七月二十七日浙江省台州早稻上市时，陈谷市价当日下午跌到四百四十元一斤。国营粮食公司大量收购后，该地谷价三天后就回升到五百元一斤，和牌价完全一致。其他各地谷价也都在上市后几天内达到基本稳定。
    靠近产棉地区的国营贸易公司和合作社在收购新谷时准备了供应棉农的粮食，有计划地组织了近距离调运。
    华东各地农民售谷后纷纷添购大量农具、肥料、耕牛等生产资料。浙江省余姚土产公司在早稻上市后的十天左右即卖出肥田粉四万六千二百八十斤，豆饼七十八万多斤。该省兰溪县上华村农民售谷后买进耕牛三头，各式铁器农具五百七十七件和大批竹木器具。现在各地秋粮普遍登场，各级国营贸易公司和合作社正在继续调运物资，增设机构，以适应购粮工作的需要。
