    — The Story of an Engineering Platoon of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Protecting a Bridge
        By Hou Yimin and Hong Bo
    (13) At this moment, the ice floe where Wang Shirong and two soldiers were standing made a cracking sound. The ice floe broke, and all three fell into the river; the other two comrades on other ice floes also fell into the river.
    (14) Wang Shirong climbed onto an ice floe and shouted, "Comrades, we will never let the ice floes destroy the bridge!" He jumped into the river again and rescued all eight of them, placing them on small ice floes.
    (15) Another large ice floe came rushing down. The hero Wang Shirong disappeared in front of the ice floe. The comrades who were rescuing him shouted in grief, "We must avenge Comrade Wang Shirong! Crushing the ice floes means crushing the American aggressors!"

    （十三）这时王世荣和两位战士站着的冰排，发出一阵破裂声。冰排裂开了，三人一齐掉到江里；另外两个冰块上的同志，也掉在江里了。
    （十四）王世荣爬上冰块高喊着：“同志们，我们决不让冰排冲坏桥梁！”他又跳到江中，八个人都被他救了上来，分站在小冰块上。
    （十五）另外一块大冰块又冲下来。英雄王世荣在冰块前沉没了。抢救的同志沉痛地高呼着：“我们要为王世荣同志复仇！粉碎冰块就是粉碎美国侵略者！”
