Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: According to a report from the Telecommunications Agency in New York on the 10th, the Chairman of the Progressive Party USA, Vincent Hallinan, and Secretary Bobillier Baldwin, issued a statement on the 9th regarding the Korean armistice negotiations, stating: "Within a week, the American people have received two proofs that the President talks about peace, but his actions speak louder than his eloquence. The government's negotiators in Korea have put forward some unacceptable conditions, apparently trying to obstruct the armistice negotiations."

The statement continued: "Last week, General Collins' testimony showed that the government once believed that taking the 38th parallel as the boundary line would be a victory for the UN forces. Secretary of State Acheson and General Ridgway also said this a few months ago. However, the UN negotiators suddenly demanded that a ceasefire line be established north of the 38th parallel. While the negotiators are doing meaningless things, American soldiers are sacrificing themselves." "Weeks ago, the President said in Detroit: Facts speak louder than words. People will judge him based on this test. Obviously, only the American people jointly demanding peace can force the President to seek peace."

　　美进步党责美政府阻挠谈判
    【新华社十一日讯】据电通社纽约十日讯：美国进步党主席宾逊与书记鲍尔温，于九日就朝鲜停战谈判问题发表声明称：“在一个星期之内，美国人民得到两次证明，总统口里谈和平，但他的行动却胜于他的雄辩。政府在朝鲜的谈判代表提出了一些令人不可能接受的条件，显然是想阻挠停战谈判。”
    声明继称：“上周柯林斯将军的证言表明：政府曾认为：以三八线为分界线将是联合国军的胜利。国务卿艾奇逊和李奇微将军在几个月以前也曾这样说。可是，联合国的谈判代表却突然要求在三八线以北建立休战线。当谈判代表在做无谓的事情的时候，美国兵则在牺牲。”“数周前总统在底特律说过：事实胜于雄辩。人们将根据这种考验来对他下评判。显然，只有美国人民共同要求和平才可以迫使总统谋求和平。”
