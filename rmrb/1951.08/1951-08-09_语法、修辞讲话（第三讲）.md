Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 3)
    Lü Shuxiang, Zhu Dexi
            Section 3 Pronouns, 们 (men), 的 (de)
    The reference of pronouns should be clear. The references of pronouns in these two sentences are unclear:
    (1) Shanghai residents, suffering from the brutal oppression of the US military and the puppet government, experienced successive waves of student movements, labor movements, and workers' movements.
        Their internal contradictions also intensified, with mutual attacks. (Report)
    (2) Volume One includes the German government's diplomatic documents from November 1937 to December 1938. In addition, some individual documents from other countries' governments that are directly related to the former are also included. (Report)
    The "their" in (1) can only refer to Shanghai residents in terms of sentence structure, but the author intends to refer to the US military and the puppet government. It should be revised to "The US military and the puppet government brutally oppressed Shanghai residents..." The "former" in (2) seems to refer to Germany, but "Germany" and "diplomatic documents" are not parallel items and cannot be replaced by "former" and "latter". It should say "Germany"; if it refers to the documents, it should say "these documents." ("Some" refers to the documents below, which is too far away and should be placed in the position of "individual," and "individual" is useless and should be omitted.)
    "咱们 (zánmen)" and "我们 (wǒmen)." "咱们" includes the listener, while "我们" does not include the listener. For example, "我们 are northerners, 你们 are southerners, 咱们 are all Chinese." This distinction only exists in the northern dialect. The south uses "我们" for everything. Northerners often only use "我们" in more formal situations instead of "咱们." When writing, it's acceptable not to use "咱们," but if you do, you must use it correctly. These following two sentences have problems:
    (3) Old lady, we 咱们 can pour tea ourselves. 咱们 are family! (Work)
    (4) 咱们 are not making excessive demands on people who are engaged in translation, especially news translators. (Periodical)
    The first "咱们" in (3) obviously does not include the old lady and should use "我们." The difference in (4) is more subtle. This sentence is the author expressing their own attitude, not including the reader, so only "我们" (equal to "I") can be used; if "并不是" is changed to "不应该," then "咱们" can be used.
    "他 (tā)" and "她 (tā)." "他" and "她" were originally only distinctions in writing. Sometimes they are useful, and sometimes they cause unnecessary trouble, as seen in these three sentences:
    (5) No matter if they are petty bourgeoisie, bourgeoisie, or even old intellectuals from landlord class origins, their class restricts 他 or 她 understanding of class struggle in the countryside. (Report)
    (6) After liberation, the light of dawn illuminated this group of toiling people. 他 (她) are constantly undergoing transformation and rebirth. (Periodical)
    (7) The extras in the film are real workers—她们 and 他们! (Periodical)
    Is there any need to distinguish between male and female in (5) and (6)? Both of these sentences can use "他们." (7) may have a need for distinction, then it should say "male and female workers" or "male workers and female workers." In short, "他 or 她," "他们 and 她们," "他 (她) 们" sound inexplicable. Especially "他 (她) 们," some dialect areas sound like "太太们 (taitai men) - wives." This form is also not needed in writing. No one stipulates that "他们" is not allowed to include women. (The "进行...新生 (jinxing...xinsheng) - undergoing...rebirth" in example 6 and "曙光照耀 (shuguang zhaoyao) - light of dawn" are also inappropriate.)
    "那 (nà)" and "哪 (nǎ)." The demonstrative pronoun "那" and the interrogative pronoun "哪" were both written as "那" in the past. In the last thirty years, a "口 (kǒu)" radical has been added to the interrogative pronoun to show the difference. Many conservatives still ignore it and still write "那" for everything. In fact, writing "那" and "哪" in different ways is more justified than "他," "她," and "它," because this is not only a written distinction, but also represents different pronunciations. The demonstrative "na" is in the fourth tone, and the interrogative "na" is in the third tone. They are completely different words in language (just like "卖 (mài) - sell" and "买 (mǎi) - buy"), so why not distinguish them in writing? Therefore, "哪" is needed. "哪里 (nǎli) - where" should also be distinguished from "那里 (nàli) - there," and "哪有 (nǎ yǒu) - how can there be" and "哪怕 (nǎ pà) - even if" should no longer be written as "那有 (nà yǒu)" and "那怕 (nà pà)."
    The "们 (men)" after nouns. The word "们" is not equal to the plural ending in European languages. It is not necessary to add "们" every time there is more than one person. According to Chinese habits, if there are words indicating quantity or "各 (gè) - each," "其他 (qítā) - other," etc. in front, then "们" is not added after. The following examples do not conform to this habit and the "们" should be removed.
    (8) Every day, four or five hundred children 们 crowd into this reading garden to read books. (Periodical)
    (9) At that time, many people 们 had great doubts about whether the People's Government could stabilize national prices in a short period. (Periodical)
    (10) After arriving in Beijing, the report was quickly written by all the experts 们. (Periodical)
    (11) Let the other workers 们 on the ship coordinate and fully exert their effectiveness. (Book)
    Collective nouns, such as "人民 (rénmín) - people," "群众 (qúnzhòng) - masses," "观众 (guānzhòng) - audience," "军队 (jūnduì) - army," themselves indicate the plural and naturally cannot add "们."
    (12) It can never be imagined that academics are public and should be fully open to the people 们 to enjoy. (Periodical)
    (13) After the firewood cooperative collapsed, they also failed to explain the accounts to the masses 们, and it ended without a conclusion. (Report)
    Now there are not only "人民们" and "群众们," but also "一个人民 (yī gè rénmín) - one people" and "一个群众 (yī gè qúnzhòng) - one mass," but most people do not approve of these obviously unreasonable forms. Two more examples:
    (14) Southern Jiangsu not only has feudalism and local bullies; but the crimes of the landlord class 们 are even worse than those in the old liberated areas. (Periodical)
    (15) Japanese reactionary forces are still struggling, and under the direct cooperation of American reactionary forces, they seem to be arrogant. (Periodical)
    Although "人民" and "群众" cannot add "们," they can still be replaced by "他们," but "阶级 (jiējí) - class" and "势力 (shìlì) - forces" can neither add "们" nor be replaced by "他们."
    The basic principle is to add "们" only when it is necessary to specifically indicate that there is more than one, otherwise, do not add "们." For example:
    (16) Chemists 们 divide all kinds of food into four categories: carbohydrates (sugars), fats, proteins, and minerals. (Book)
    This "们" is not wrong, but it is unnecessary, so it is better to remove it. Nouns in Chinese, if a numeral is not added in front, can refer to one or many.
    的 (de), 底 (dǐ), 地 (dì). People often ask about the differences between these three characters. To answer this question, it should be discussed separately from the aspects of spoken and written language. There is only one character in spoken language, most places say de, some places say di. This character assumes a very heavy task, so it is quite convenient to write it in two or three different forms in writing, especially when translating foreign articles. The general distinction method is:
    "底 (dǐ)"—indicates possession, such as "我底 (wǒ dǐ) - mine," "中国底 (Zhōngguó dǐ) - China's."
    "地 (dì)"—used after the adjunct of a verb or adjective, such as "慢慢地学习 (mànmàn de xuéxí) - study slowly," "不客气地批评他 (bù kèqì de pīpíng tā) - criticize him impolitely," "异乎寻常地热烈 (yìhū xúncháng de rèliè) - unusually warm."
    "的 (de)"—used elsewhere. However, there are relatively few people who distinguish between these three characters. Most people only distinguish between "的" and "地" (possession also uses "的"), and some people only use "的."
    Generally speaking, it is not difficult to distinguish these three characters. There is only one occasion where there is a slight problem with using "的" or "地," that is, when a verb is used as a subject, object, or predicate, especially in a subject-predicate phrase. For example:
    (1) It is also necessary to always be vigilant and carry out a long-term (的, 地) struggle against counter-revolutionaries. (Report)
    (2) Individual systems and units only pay attention to (的, 地) engaging in business in isolation while ignoring the combination with politics. (Report)
    (3) The rapid (的, 地) transition to counter-offensive by the Korean People's Army caused the US-Li army to be panicked.
    If you think that the verb here has become a noun, then you must use "的," otherwise you should use "地." According to most people's "linguistic sense," it is better to use "的" in (1), and it is better to use "地" in (2) and (3), indicating that the situation in these three sentences is different. (The original authors of examples 1 and 2 both used "地.")

　　语法、修辞讲话（第三讲）
    吕叔湘、朱德熙
            第三段  代词、们、的
    代词所指要明确。这两句里的代词所指不明确：
    （一）上海居民因受到美军和伪政府的残酷压迫，舞潮、学潮、工潮迭起
        。他们内部的矛盾也日益剧烈，互相攻击。（报）
    （二）第一卷包括由一九三七年十一月到一九三八年十二月这一阶段中德
        国政府的外交文件，此外还编入了一些与前者直接有关的其他各国政
        府的个别文件。（报）（一）的“他们”在句子的结构上只能指上海居民，但作者的意思是指美军和伪政府。应该改做“美军和伪政府残酷地压迫上海居民……”。（二）的“前者”似乎是指德国，但是“德国”和“外交文件”不是并列的东西，不能用“前者”“后者”来替代，应该说“德国”；如果指文件，应该说“这些文件”。（“一些”指底下的文件，离得太远，应该放在“个别”的位置上，“个别”无用，宜省。）
    “咱们”和“我们”。“咱们”包括听话的人在内，“我们”不包括听话的人在内。例如“我们是北方人，你们是南方人，咱们都是中国人”。这个区别只有北方话里有，南方一概用“我们”，北方人在比较正式的场合也往往不用“咱们”，只用“我们”。写文章的时候，不用“咱们”是可以的，可是如果用它，就得用对。下面这两句是有问题的：
    （三）老大娘，喝茶咱们自己会倒。咱们是一家人嘛！（作）
    （四）咱们并不是对于搞翻译的人，特别是新闻翻译者，要求过高。（期）（三）的第一个“咱们”显然不包括老大娘在内，应该用“我们”。（四）的差别比较隐藏些。这一句话是作者表明自己的态度，不包括读者在内，只能用“我们”（等于“我”）；如果“并不是”改做“不应该”，那就可以用“咱们”了。
    “他”和“她”。“他”和“她”本来只是书面上的分别，有时候有点用处，有时候也引起不必要的麻烦，像这三句里所见：
    （五）不论小资产阶级或资产阶级，甚或地主阶级出身的旧知识分子，阶级限定了他或她对于农村中阶级斗争的认识。（报）
    （六）解放后，曙光照耀了这一群劳苦的人民。他（她）们是在不断的进行改造与新生之中。（期）
    （七）片子里的群众演员，那是真正的工人——她们和他们！（期）（五）和（六）分别男女有什么必要呢？这两句都可以用“他们”。（七）也许有分别的需要，那末也应该说“男女工人们”或是“男工人和女工人”。总之，“他或她”“他们和她们”“他（她）们”听在耳朵里是莫名其妙的。尤其是“他（她）们”，某些方言区的人听起来，倒像是“太太们”。这个形式，书面上也没有需要，并没有人规定“他们”不准包括女性在内。（例六的“进行……新生”和“曙光照耀”也都欠妥。）
    “那”和“哪”。指示代词“那”和疑问代词“哪”，从前都写做“那”，近三十年来才在疑问代词上加个“口”字边，以示区别。有许多守旧的人还是不理会，还是一概写“那”。其实“那”和“哪”写成不同的样子，比“他”“她”“它”更有理由，因为这不仅是书面的分别，是代表不同的语音的。指示的na是去声，疑问的na是上声，在语言里是截然不同的两个词（正如“卖”和“买”），为什么不在文字上加以分别呢？所以“哪”是需要的。“哪里”也应该跟“那里”有区别，“哪有”和“哪怕”也都不应该再写成“那有”和“那怕”。
    名词之后的“们”字。“们”字并不等于欧洲语言里的复数语尾，不是每逢不止一个人的时候就得加个“们”。照汉语的习惯，前面有表示数量的词，或“各”“其他”等，后面就不加“们”。下面的例句不合于这个习惯，应该把“们”字去掉。
    （八）每天都有四五百儿童们拥进这个阅览园来看书。（期）
    （九）当时有不少的人们，曾对人民政府能否在很短时期内争取全国物价走向稳定这一问题上，抱有很大的怀疑。（期）
    （十）到了北京之后，很快的便由各位专家们把报告写出。（期）
    （十一）让船上的其他工作者们协和一致地充分发挥他们的效能。（书）集体意义的名词，例如“人民”“群众”“观众”“军队”，本身就表示复数，自然不能再加“们”字。
    （十二）永远想不到学术是公开的，是应该充分的公开给人民们享用的。（期）
    （十三）木柴合作社垮台后，他们也未向群众们交代账目，不了了之。（报）现在不但有“人民们”和“群众们”，并且有“一个人民”和“一个群众”，但是大多数人不赞成这些显然不合理的形式。另外两个例：
    （十四）苏南不仅有封建，有恶霸；而且地主阶级们的罪行血案，比之老区有过之无不及。（期）
    （十五）日本反动势力还在挣扎，他们在美国反动势力直接合作下，似乎 还气焰万丈。（期）“人民”和“群众”虽然不能加“们”，还可以用“他们”去替代，“阶级”和“势力”是既不能加“们”，也不能用“他们”去替代的。
    基本的原则，只在需要特别说明是不止一个的时候加“们”，否则不加“们”。例如：
    （十六）化学家们把各式各样的食物分成碳水化合物（醣）、脂肪、蛋白质、矿物质等四类。（书）这个“们”字不算错，但是不必要，因此不如去掉。汉语里的名词，假如前面不加数词，是可以指一个也可以指许多个的。
    的、底、地。常常有人问起这三个字的分别。回答这个问题应该就口语和文字两方面分开来说。口语里只有一个字，大多数地方说de，有些地方说di。这个字担负的任务非常繁重，所以在文字上写成两个或三个不同的形式是有相当的方便的，尤其是翻译外国文章的时候。一般的分别法是：
    “底”——表示领属关系，如“我底”“中国底”。
    “地”——用在动词和形容词的附加语的后头，如“慢慢地学习”“不客气地批评他”“异乎寻常地热烈”。
    “的”——用在其他地方。可是分别用这三个字的人还是比较少数，多数人只分别“的”和“地”（领属关系也用“的”），还有人只用“的”一个字。
    大概说来，分别这三个字是不难的。只有一种场合，用“的”还是用“地”有点问题，就是在动词用来做主语、宾语或表语的时候，尤其是在主谓短语里。例如：
    （一）还要时时刻刻提高警惕，对反革命进行长期（的、地）斗争。（报）
    （二）个别系统和单位只注意孤立（的、地）搞业务而忽视与政治结合。（报）
    （三）朝鲜人民军的迅速（的、地）转入反攻，使美李军惊惶失措。要是你认为这里的动词已经变成名词，就得用“的”，否则就该用“地”。照一般人的“语觉”，（一）用“的”好些，（二）和（三）用“地”好些，可见这三句的情况不一样。（例一例二原作者都用“地”。）
                          （本段完，全文未完）
