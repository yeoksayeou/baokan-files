工矿组 of the North China Sub-Group of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea

　　From June 13th to July 23rd, we gave 73 reports in the industrial and mining areas of Taiyuan, Yangquan, Jingxing, Jiaozuo, Xinxiang, Anyang, Jixian, and Fengfeng, directly contacting 221,500 people, the vast majority of whom were workers and their families. Everywhere we went, the masses were in high spirits, and grand welcome and farewell meetings were held. The people braved the scorching sun and heavy rain to listen attentively to our reports. A young cadre from the Jingxing Mining Union listened to four reports in a row. A 73-year-old woman in Jinyuan County, Shanxi Province, did not leave after listening to the report, still waiting to see the representatives of the delegation. This shows the high patriotic enthusiasm of the people in various places and their concern for the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in Korea.

　　The political consciousness of the masses in various places, especially the workers, has been significantly improved after listening to the reports. After they learned about the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the battlefield and the situation of Korean workers launching production competitions despite enemy aircraft strafing and bombing, many workers automatically checked and revised their patriotic covenants and production plans. After the workers of Yangquan No. 4 Mine listened to the report on June 23rd, the mine's coal production exceeded the highest previous daily output by more than 5% the next day. This report also promoted the donation movement in various places, and many people increased their donations after listening to the report.

　　During this period of work, we have the following experiences:

　　1. In order to make the relay report better and play a greater role, we should establish close contact with the higher-level Resist America, Aid Korea branches in the areas to be reached before departing to give reports in various places. The provincial and prefectural Resist America, Aid Korea branches should convey the significance and role of the relay report and the matters that should be prepared to the lower-level branches at all levels, and let them fully prepare and deliberate in advance among the masses. After arriving in the area where the relay report is to be given, we should discuss the content and focus of the report with the local leading organs. This will not only attract local attention to the relay work, but also facilitate the local leading organs to fully prepare and organize the work.

　　2. Before giving the report, it is necessary to understand the local work situation and the ideological situation of the masses, and to understand the objects listening to the report, so as to prepare the materials for the report. When reporting, we should try to make it suitable for the understanding level of the participants and take care of all the audience as much as possible. When reporting to workers and peasants, we should try to use popular language that the masses themselves use, and use concrete and vivid facts to tell the story themes, so that the audience will have a deep impression and achieve greater results.

　　3. The content of the report should correctly and comprehensively reflect the situation on the Korean front. For example, many people know that we have achieved great victories on the Korean front, but they do not understand the arduous struggle of the soldiers. Therefore, when we talk about the Volunteers' heroic fighting and revolutionary optimism, we should also appropriately explain the arduous situation in their battles. For example, when talking about enemy aircraft on the Korean battlefield, we should admit that aircraft have a role to play, but because we have created operational and working methods to deal with enemy aircraft and launched an anti-aircraft movement, coupled with the low morale of enemy pilots, enemy aircraft do not pose a great threat to us. If we had more airplanes and artillery, we could eliminate more enemies. Talking about the enemy's embarrassment should be to illustrate the heroic fighting of our Volunteers, and not to say that the enemy has no combat effectiveness and is vulnerable. If the above is not paid attention to, it will reduce the effect of the report, or even cause adverse effects among the masses.

　　4. The situation is constantly developing. When we are doing relay reporting work, we should always pay attention to studying current affairs and carry out propaganda in conjunction with the current situation and tasks. After the news of the Korean armistice negotiations came out and the General Association for Resist America, Aid Korea issued five major appeals on July 4th, the group took the initiative to conduct propaganda based on the new situation. Post offices in various places successively provided us with newspapers, which helped our study.

　　5. According to our experience, it is not convenient to hold meetings with more than 10,000 people. The objects are complex, the requirements are different, and the emotions are difficult to grasp. If time permits, it is advisable to hold meetings with fewer than 5,000 people with a single object. If time does not permit, representative meetings can be held, and the attendees will then relay the information after the meeting.

　　6. Large meetings of thousands of people cannot be held well without good organization. Therefore, before the meeting, we should suggest that the local leading organs do a good job in organizing the meeting: for example, assigning personnel to maintain order and collect audience feedback. The person presiding over the meeting should control the slogans, applause, etc., so as to avoid problems and affect order. Before the report begins, it is best for the local responsible comrade to make a brief enlightening speech, and make a brief summary after the report, and put forward specific appeals to mobilize the masses to discuss. After we gave a report in the Yangquan industrial and mining area, we seized the opportunity to convene a representative meeting to discuss and arrange relevant work, which had a greater effect.

　　In addition, regarding the issue of welcome, farewell, and reception, we have the following opinions: All activities that are related to the masses and can have educational significance to the masses should be solemn and serious; and the reception of individual representatives should be simple and casual. First, to save material resources, and second, to save time, so as not to affect the work of local responsible comrades and the rest of the reporting comrades.

### 作传达报告应注意些什么？

　　作传达报告应注意些什么？
    中国人民赴朝慰问团华北分团工矿组
    从六月十三日到七月二十三日，我们在太原、阳泉、井陉、焦作、新乡、安阳、汲县、峰峰等工矿区分别作了七十三次报告，直接接触了二十二万一千五百多人，其中绝大部分是工人和工人家属。我们所到之处，群众情绪很高，普遍地举行了盛大的欢迎和欢送会。人民群众冒着烈日，淋着大雨聚精会神地听我们的报告。井陉矿工会一个青年干部，一连听了四场报告。山西晋源县城一个七十三岁的老太太，听完了报告还不走，还等着看看慰问团代表。从这里可以看出各地人民高涨的爱国热情和他们对在朝鲜作战的中国人民志愿军的关怀。
    各地群众，尤其是工人们，在听完报告以后，政治觉悟显著提高。他们知道了中国人民志愿军在战场上的英勇作战以及朝鲜工人冒着敌机的扫射轰炸，开展生产竞赛的情形后，不少工人自动地检查修改了自己的爱国公约和生产计划。阳泉四矿职工在六月二十三日听了报告以后，第二天该矿产煤量超过了过去最高日产量的百分之五强。这次报告也推动了各地的捐献运动，听完报告后，增加捐献数字的人很多。
    在这段时期的工作中，我们有以下几点体验：
    一、为了把传达报告作得更好，能够发挥更大的作用，在出发各地作报告以前，应与到达地区的上级抗美援朝分会取得密切联系。省级和专区的抗美援朝分会，应把传达报告的意义和作用以及应该准备的事项，逐级下达各级分会，并让其充分准备和在群众当中事先酝酿。到达传达报告的地区后，应与当地领导机关讨论报告的内容和重点。这样即会引起当地对传达工作的重视，并便利当地领导机关充分地作好准备、组织工作。
    二、在作报告以前，要了解当地的工作情况及群众的思想情况，并了解听取报告的对象，据以准备报告的材料。在报告时应尽可能作到适合与会者的理解水平和照顾到所有的听众。向工人农民作报告，要尽量用通俗的、群众自己的语言，用具体生动的事实来讲述故事的题材，这样听众的印象深刻，收效较大。
    三、报告的内容，应该正确地、全面地反映朝鲜前线的情况。比如，许多人知道我们在朝鲜前线取得了巨大的胜利，但不了解战士们艰苦奋斗的情况，因此，我们应该在讲述志愿军英勇善战和革命的乐观主义时，要同时适当地说明他们作战中的艰苦情况。又如，谈到朝鲜战场敌人的飞机时，应该承认飞机是有作用的，但由于我们创造了对付敌机的作战方法和工作方法，开展了打飞机运动，再加上敌机驾驶员的斗志不高，敌机才对我们威胁不大，如果我们有更多的飞机大炮，则能更多地消灭敌人。讲敌人的狼狈像，应该是为了说明我志愿军的英勇善战，而不能说敌人毫无战斗力，不堪一击。上述这些如不注意，就会减低报告的效果，甚或在群众中引起不良的影响。
    四、形势是不断发展的，我们在作传达报告工作的时候，应该经常注意学习时事，结合当前形势和任务来进行宣传。本组当朝鲜停战谈判消息传出和抗美援朝总会七月四日发出五大号召以后，即主动地根据新形势作了宣传。各地邮局陆续地为我们供给了报纸，帮助了我们的学习。
    五、根据我们的体验，一万人以上的大会开起来不大方便。对象复杂，要求不同，情绪难以掌握。如果时间允许，以开五千人以下的、对象单一的会为宜。如果时间不允许，则可召开代表性的会议，会后由到会人再作传达。
    六、成千上万人的大会，没有很好的组织，是不易开好的。因此会前应建议当地领导机关，作好会议的组织工作：例如派定维持秩序的人员和收集听众反应等。主持会议的人应对呼口号、鼓掌等加以掌握，以免发生毛病和影响秩序。在报告开始前，最好由当地负责同志作一简要的启发性的发言，并在报告后作个扼要的总结，并提出具体号召，发动群众讨论。阳泉工矿区在我们作报告后，即趁热打铁召开代表会议，讨论布置有关工作，收效比较大。
    此外，关于欢迎、欢送与招待问题，我们有这样的意见：一切与群众有联系的能对群众中有教育意义的活动，应该隆重严肃一些；而对于代表个人的招待，应该从简和随便一些。一来节省物力，二来节省时间，以免影响当地负责同志的工作和报告同志的休息。
