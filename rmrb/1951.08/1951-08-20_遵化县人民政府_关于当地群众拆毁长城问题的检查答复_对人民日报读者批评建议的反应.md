　　Zunhua County People's Government
    Inspection and Reply Regarding the Issue of Local People Demolishing the Great Wall

       Editor:
    The letter from Comrade Shi Changli, published in the People's Daily on June 14th, criticizing the demolition of the Great Wall by the masses in the Second District of our county, is factual. Following this criticism, we have conducted an investigation into this matter and corrected this erroneous action.

    Since the publication of this criticism in the newspaper, a seven-person inspection team, consisting of the Education Section of our county and cultural and educational assistants from districts near the Great Wall, was organized to inspect the demolition of the Great Wall within our county. The inspection results showed that demolition of the Great Wall had occurred in the Second, Third, and Tenth Districts of our county. The most serious case was in the Taoyuan area of the Second District, where a section of the Great Wall on the western slope, one *li* in length, had its walls and bunkers demolished; a three-*li* section on the eastern slope had also been demolished.

    Local people began dismantling and transporting the city bricks during the enemy-puppet period to build houses or sell them. After liberation, because the local government did not promptly publicize the policy of preserving cultural relics and historical sites to the masses, the dismantling and transportation of city bricks continued. Following this criticism, in addition to issuing written instructions to all districts prohibiting further demolition of the Great Wall, we also sent special personnel to various areas near the Great Wall to carry out publicity to ensure that no further demolition incidents occur.

    During this inspection, we found that the phenomenon of demolishing the Great Wall was also quite serious in the Banbishan Village area within the territory of Rehe Province, with local people regarding the dismantling and transportation of city bricks as a production project. We hope that the local government agencies will pay attention to correcting this.

                                          Zunhua County People's Government, Hebei

### 遵化县人民政府  关于当地群众拆毁长城问题的检查答复  对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　遵化县人民政府
    关于当地群众拆毁长城问题的检查答复       编辑同志：
    六月十四日人民日报发表石长礼同志批评我县第二区群众拆毁长城的来信，这封信里所说的事情是真实的，经过这次批评，我们已对此事进行了调查并纠正了这种错误行动。
    自报纸上发表了这一批评以后，即由我县教育科及靠近长城各区文教助理员等七人，组织检查小组，检查我县境内长城被拆毁情况。检查结果，我县第二、三、十区都有拆毁长城的事件发生。其中最严重的是二区桃园一带，该地长城西坡，有一华里长的一段，城墙和城上的碉堡都已拆毁；东坡有三华里一段，也被拆毁。
    当地群众从敌伪时期就开始拆运城砖，建造房屋或出卖。解放后，因为当地政府没有及时向群众宣传保存文物古迹的政策，所以拆运城砖的事一直继续着。经过这次批评，我们除了用书面指示各区不得再行拆毁长城以外，并由专人分赴各靠近长城地区进行了宣传，以保证不再发生拆毁事件。
    在这次检查中，我们发现热河省境内半壁山村一带，拆毁长城的现象也是相当严重的，当地群众把拆运城砖看作是搞生产的一个项目。我们希望当地政府机关注意纠正。
                                          河北遵化县人民政府
