　　Shandong Holds Industrial Capital Construction Work Conference
    Criticizing Various Erroneous Ideas
    Resolving to No Longer Act Rashly
    The State Council Financial and Economic Committee's notice on inspecting capital construction and the People's Daily's criticism of rework and waste in capital construction have attracted the attention of the Shandong Provincial People's Government's Industry Department. The Industry Department convened a provincial state-owned local industrial capital construction work conference on July 3. The conference exposed the chaotic phenomena of past capital construction work, criticized erroneous ideas, and laid an ideological foundation for the steady progress of future capital construction.

    During the conference, relevant documents were used as weapons to examine past capital construction work. It was unanimously agreed that the understanding of the economic and political significance of capital construction was vague in the past. There was also a serious existence of supply system thinking and a reckless work style in capital construction. Some people believed that "large factories need to make plans when constructing, but small factories do not"; or complained that "the construction time is not as long as the time for making plans and instructions," or emphasized difficulties such as a lack of cadres and unfamiliarity with the business. As a result, they acted rashly in capital construction, blindly constructing without plans, technical designs, or detailed construction drawings and instructions. The organizational structure was also quite chaotic. Many units did not have a specialized organization to lead this work. Some units were part-time general affairs departments, and some were part-time manufacturing departments. The Industry Department was responsible through the finance section. (The planning department only established a capital construction section in March of this year, and a capital construction office was recently established.) Under these circumstances, everyone did whatever came to mind. Today, they report building a workshop and adding a machine; tomorrow, they report building a toilet and adding a bathhouse. Three hundred and sixty-five days a year, they constantly report and constantly build. After the Shandong Provincial Financial and Economic Committee, the Industry Department, and the leading units of various enterprises jointly studied and approved the controlled figures for capital construction for the entire year of 1951, various units proposed many new construction projects. In the past, some units even had the phenomenon of not asking for instructions beforehand and not reporting afterward in capital construction. Under the control of this erroneous thinking, national assets have suffered serious losses in the past two years. At the meeting, each unit conducted self-criticism on this phenomenon:

    The first is being eager for quick results and lacking long-term plans and overall consideration. For example, the iron factory of the Laiyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office Industrial Company, because it was eager to build the factory, did not conduct a thorough investigation beforehand, the factory site was not reasonably determined, and the water source problem was ignored. The water source was half a mile away from the factory. Although the iron factory used very little water, it was very inconvenient to transport water from half a mile away. The Chengda Yarn Factory lacked overall consideration when building the factory and changed its plans midway. When the factory was constructing ventilation equipment, it initially only considered the needs of the weaving room, but midway it considered the needs of the spinning room, so it moved the air door between the weaving room and the spinning room, but this damaged the effectiveness of the original design. The walls between the cloth room and the yarn room of the factory were reworked several times: when the cloth room was expanded, the wall was demolished and moved towards the yarn room; later, the yarn room needed to be expanded, so the newly built wall was demolished and moved towards the cloth room. When the cloth room needed to be expanded again, the second wall built was demolished and moved towards the yarn room. The Dezhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office Industrial Company's construction of a power plant only took into account the current needs and did not anticipate future development. The determined factory site could only accommodate equipment with a generating capacity of 1,700 kilowatts. If it were to be expanded further, the factory would have to be relocated. The Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory installed an air hammer base. Due to rushing work in the winter, the cement and gravel were not mixed evenly and were not tightly bonded. Before long, the base completely cracked. Sometimes, due to eagerness for quick results, construction would begin before the design was completed. For example, when the Weixin Chemical Factory built a new workshop, the pipeline layout and machine installation were not ready, so they started building the house first. After the workshop was completed, the pipelines and machines could not be installed, so they had to dig walls and chisel holes to install the pipelines and open ditches to install the machines. The brand-new workshop was ruined. Sometimes, in order to rush work, they only required the construction time to be as short as possible, but did not require the project quality to meet standards. When the Renfeng Yarn Factory installed looms, it only paid attention to completing the installation task on time, but the machines did not operate smoothly. If they were forced to operate, the resulting cloth would be of poor quality.

    Some engineering design work has formalistic tendencies. They just sit in the office and draw pictures, without conducting on-the-spot surveys. For example, the Weixin Chemical Factory designed supports for steam pipelines, originally intending to reduce the original five-meter-high supports to four meters. However, the designers blindly believed in the original Japanese puppet period blueprints (the supports on the drawing were six meters), and did not go to measure it themselves, so they reduced it by one meter according to the original drawing, thinking it would be fine. After the steam pipes were erected, they discovered that they were the same height as the original supports, still five meters, without any difference. This lost the original intention of the design. The Shandong Construction Engineering Company built an oil depot for a certain unit. The foundation conditions were not clearly surveyed before the design. Soon after the oil entered the depot, the ground of the oil depot was pressed down by the oil. Only then was it discovered that the ground was water, mud, and sand. It had to be repaired again. Sometimes the house design and machine installation cannot be coordinated, and even one part of a building cannot be coordinated with another part. For example, the Renfeng Yarn Factory built a workshop. After the workshop was completed, the machine was too long and the workshop was too narrow, so the machine could not be installed, causing rework and waste. The Xuzhou Industrial Company was building a burlap bag factory. The walls, doors, and windows of the workshop were all built, but when the beam was being placed, it was discovered that the frame was too wide and the beam was too short, so the beam could not be placed and had to be reworked. Some projects failed to scientifically grasp the amount of materials used during design, resulting in waste. For example, the Shandong Construction Engineering Company contracted for thirty brick and tile houses in Jiuhu. After completion, there were still eighty cubic meters of stone sand, fifteen tons of cement, and thirty thousand bricks and tiles left over, wasting a lot of transportation back and forth for hundreds of miles. Another example is that the Dezhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office Industrial Company was building a two-story building. After the ground floor was built, the materials were used up and the money was used up. There was no way but to temporarily stop work.

    After checking and criticizing the supply system mentality and the reckless adventurist work style, everyone unanimously stated that they could no longer act so rashly in the future. Based on past experience, the conference decided to establish specialized institutions and various systems responsible for capital construction, and prepare to compile a comprehensive capital construction plan for 1951.

　　山东召开工业基本建设工作会议
    批判各种错误思想
    决心不再草率从事
    政务院财政经济委员会关于检查基本建设的通知和人民日报对基本建设中返工浪费现象的批评，已引起山东省人民政府工业厅的重视。工业厅于七月三日召开了全省国营地方工业基本建设工作会议。会议中揭发了过去基本建设工作的混乱现象，对错误的思想进行了批评，为今后基本建设的稳步前进打下思想基础。
    会议中以有关文件为武器检查了过去的基本建设工作，一致认为过去对基本建设的经济意义和政治意义的认识是模糊不清的。在基本建设工作中还严重地存在着供给制思想和盲目乱干的作风。有些人认为“大厂进行建筑时需要做计划，小厂则不必”；或者埋怨“建设时间还不如做计划、批示的时间长”，或者是强调干部缺乏、业务不熟悉等困难。因而在基本建设中就轻举妄动，既无计划，又无技术设计，更无施工详图及说明，就盲目施工。在组织机构方面，情况也相当混乱。很多单位没有专门机构来组织领导这一工作。有的单位是总务科兼职，有的单位是制造科兼职，工业厅是由财务处负责。（计划处于今年三月才设立基本建设科，最近才成立了基本建设处。）在这种情况下，大家是想起啥来搞啥。今天报告盖个工房、添部机器，明天又报告盖个厕所、添个澡塘。一年三百六十五天，不断地报告，不断地修建。山东省财政经济委员会、工业厅和各企业领导单位，共同研究批准一九五一年全年基本建设的控制数目字之后，各单位又提出不少新建项目。过去，有的单位在基本建设中甚至有事先不请示事后不报告的现象。在这种错误思想支配下，过去两年的基本建设，曾使国家资财遭受了严重损失。会议中各单位就此种现象进行了自我检讨：
    首先是急于求成，缺乏长远打算和通盘考虑。如莱阳专署实业公司的铁工厂，因为急于建厂，以致事先调查不周，厂址勘定不合理，忽略了水源问题。水源在离厂半里路的地方，铁工厂虽然用水很少，但从半里路外运水也极不方便。成大纱厂建厂时缺乏通盘考虑，中途又改变计划。该厂建设通风设备时，起初只考虑到织布间需要，中途又考虑到纺纱间也需要，于是又把风门移至织布间和纺纱间之间，但已损害了原设计的效能。该厂布间和纱间中间的墙壁曾数次返工：当扩大布间时，把墙拆掉向纱间移动；以后，纱间又要扩大，于是又把新建筑起来的墙壁拆掉移向布间。待布间又需要扩大时，又把第二次建起的墙壁拆掉移向纱间。德州专署实业公司建设电厂，只照顾到目前需要而未预计到将来的发展，勘定的厂址，仅能容纳发电一千七百千瓦的设备的范围，如果再扩大，必须迁厂。新华制药厂，装设气锤底座，由于冬天赶工，洋灰和石子搅拌得不匀，结合得也不紧密。用了不久，底座就完全裂碎了。有时由于急于求成，甚至设计未完就先行施工。如维新化学工厂新建工房时管线线路及机器按装未设备好，就先动工盖房子。工房竣工后，管线机器无法按装，结果只好挖墙凿洞按装管线，起地开沟按装机器。崭新的工房，弄得破烂不堪。有时为了赶工，就只要求工程时间越短越好，而不要求工程质量合乎标准。仁丰纱厂按装布机时，只注意按时完成按装任务，但是机器却运转不灵，如强行运转，出来的布就不好。
    有些工程设计工作中有形式主义偏向。只是坐在办公室画图，没有经过实地勘测。如维新化学工厂，设计蒸汽管路的支架，原意是要把原来五公尺高的支架减为四公尺。但设计人员在设计时，盲目相信原来日伪时期的蓝图（图上的支架是六公尺），而未去亲自测量，就按原图减少了一公尺，已为就可以了。待汽管架起之后，才发现和原支架一般高，还是五公尺，分毫不差。这就失去了设计的本意。山东建筑工程公司，为某单位建筑油库。设计前地基情况未勘察清楚，油入库不久，油库地面被油压陷。这时才发现地下面是水、泥、沙基。只好重新修理。有的房屋设计和机械按装不能配合，甚至一个建筑物本身这一部分和那一部分都不能配合。如仁丰纱厂建设工房。工房竣工后，机器太长，工房太窄，机器无法按装，造成返工浪费。徐州市实业公司建设麻袋厂，工房的墙、门、窗都建筑好了，在上梁的时候，发现房框太宽、梁太短，结果不能上梁，必须返工。有的工程在设计时未能科学地掌握用料的多少，以致形成浪费。如山东建筑工程公司，在九湖包揽三十间砖瓦房，竣工后尚余石沙八十立方米，洋灰十五吨，砖瓦三万块，往返运输几百里浪费很大。又如德州专署实业公司，盖两层的楼房，待底层盖起后，材料用完了，钱也用完了，没有办法只好暂时停工。
    经过检查，批判了供给制的思想，和盲目乱干的冒险主义作风，大家一致表示今后再也不能那样草率从事了。会议根据过去情况，决定成立负责基本建设的专门机构和各种制度，并准备编制一九五一年的全面的基本建设计划。
