Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 22nd: TASS, Berlin - The Seventh Council Meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) opened in Berlin on the 21st. Many guests attending the Youth Festival and representatives of national youth organizations from various countries that have not yet joined the WFDY attended the meeting. The President of the WFDY, Billinguer, delivered the opening speech, hoping that the cooperation and unity among the various youth organizations, which were significantly demonstrated during the festival, would strengthen the common struggle for peace and a better future for young people. The meeting unanimously adopted the following agenda: 1. The achievements of the Third World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and the new tasks of the WFDY in consolidating the unified action of youth in the struggle for peace. 2. Organizing an international conference to defend the rights of young people. 3. Accepting new members into the WFDY. Billinguer gave a report on the first agenda item.

Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: TASS, Berlin - The Council Meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, held here, continued its discussion on the morning of the 23rd on the report by WFDY President Billinguer on the new tasks of world youth in the struggle for peace. In the afternoon, the Secretary-General of the WFDY, Tenny, reported on the second agenda item, the proposal to convene an international conference to protect the rights of young people. Tenny said: The proposal to convene this conference was put forward by young workers in many factories in Western European countries—especially in the Netherlands. In capitalist countries, young people are forced to bear the full consequences of war preparations. The warmongers are annoyed by the youth's resistance to their war plans, are using all means of suppression, and are launching a wide-ranging attack on the political and social rights of the younger generation. The International Conference for the Protection of Youth Rights will be a grand review of the forces of young workers who are struggling for peace and youth rights. Tenny said: The WFDY is fully determined to win a glorious place for the younger generation in the battle for peace. The recently held World Youth and Student Festival for Peace helped young people from various countries to unite and made them more aware, and it also helped to unite young people around the world, which is a guarantee of victory. The festival showed what else we can do in this regard, and we must combine the struggle to demand a peace pact with actions to protect the rights of young people.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 25th: Feng Wenbin, head of the Chinese youth delegation attending the World Youth Festival, delivered a speech at the Council Meeting of the WFDY on the afternoon of the 22nd. Feng Wenbin pointed out that the Third World Youth and Student Festival for Peace was an unprecedented victory for world youth in strengthening unity and defending world peace. The influence of the festival is enormous, and after the representatives of various countries participating in the festival return home to convey the situation of the festival, this influence will be even greater. Chinese youth will do everything in their power to expand and deepen the impact of the festival.

Feng Wenbin said: The significance of the festival for Chinese youth is that it greatly strengthened the determination and belief of Chinese youth and youth around the world in the common cause of defending world peace. Through this festival, we have found friends all over the world who are fighting for peace. And the labor models and combat heroes in the Chinese youth delegation, especially the youth representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers, were warmly welcomed and loved wherever they went. Secondly, this festival played an important role in promoting cultural and artistic exchanges among young people from various countries. The literary and artistic programs performed by Chinese youth at this festival were welcomed, and Chinese youth will further strengthen their efforts in this regard.

Feng Wenbin described in detail the outstanding achievements of the Chinese people in developing industrial and agricultural production and education, especially the active role played by Chinese youth in national construction since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Feng Wenbin said: The American aggressors hate our peaceful construction. They have taken the old path of Japanese imperialism, first invading Korea and Taiwan, and then expanding the war of aggression to the Chinese border. In this way, peace in the Far East and even world peace have been threatened. The Chinese people have taken on the serious task of fighting for peace, organized the Chinese People's Volunteers, and fought alongside the Korean People's Army to resist the aggressors. The Chinese people know that helping Korea is defending our motherland, and it is also defending peace in the Far East and the world.

Feng Wenbin emphasized that since the beginning of the Korean War, the Chinese people have consistently advocated a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. In the current ceasefire negotiations, the United States is deliberately delaying and creating artificial obstacles, indicating that they have no sincerity for peace. However, as General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, said: "If the other side has no sincerity for peace and deliberately makes unreasonable demands, leading to the failure of the peace talks, then the war situation will not be pleasant for the other side."

Feng Wenbin denounced the United States' conspiracy to rearm West Germany and Japan and to exclude the People's Republic of China from independently concluding a peace treaty with Japan, pointing out that the American imperialists' dream will surely be completely defeated in the face of peace-loving people of all countries.

Feng Wenbin finally said: The unity of Chinese youth is expanding and strengthening. The number of members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has reached 4.3 million. Chinese youth will stand firmly under the banner of the WFDY together with world youth, learn from the example of the Soviet Communist Youth League, and fight for lasting peace and a bright future for young people.

After Feng Wenbin's speech, on behalf of Chinese youth, he presented the WFDY with a banner of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, a flower vase made from an American aggressor's shell casing captured by young soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front, and a blanket woven with the emblem of the festival.

　　世界民主青联理事会会议在柏林举行
    讨论世界青年争取和平新任务
    冯文彬报告中国人民保卫和平的斗争成就
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：世界民主青年联盟理事会第七次会议于二十一日在柏林开幕。许多参加青年联欢节的来宾和尚未加入世界民主青联的各国全国性青年组织的代表们均列席会议。世界民主青联主席比林格尔致开幕词，希望在联欢节期间显著表现出来的各个青年组织间的合作与团结，将加强争取和平与青年们美好将来的共同斗争。会议一致通过议程如下：一、第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的成就和世界民主青年联盟关于巩固青年在争取和平的斗争中的一致行动的新任务。二、组织保卫青年权利的国际会议。三、接受新盟员加入世界民主青年联盟。由比林格尔作了关于第一项议程的报告。
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：在此间举行的世界民主青年联盟理事会会议，于二十三日上午继续讨论世界青联主席比林格尔的关于世界青年争取和平的新任务的报告。下午世界民主青年联盟总书记特尼就第二项议程即关于召开保障青年权利的国际会议的建议作了报告。特尼说：召开这个会议的建议，是西欧国家——特别是荷兰的许多工厂中的劳动青年提出的。在资本主义国家，青年被迫担负起备战活动的全部后果。战争贩子们对青年抵抗他们的战争计划感得恼怒，正在使用一切的镇压手段，并对年青一代的政治和社会权利进行广泛的进攻。国际保障青年权利会议将是正在为和平与青年权利进行斗争的劳动青年力量的大检阅。特尼说：世界民主青年联盟有充分的决心在争取和平的战斗中为年青的一代赢得光荣的地位。最近举行的世界青年与学生和平联欢节帮助各国青年团结起来，并使他们更加了解，它还有助于团结全世界的青年，它是胜利的保证。联欢节说明了在这方面我们还可以做些什么，我们要把要求缔结和平公约的斗争与保障青年权利的行动结合起来。
    【新华社柏林二十五日电】出席世界青年联欢节的中国青年代表团团长冯文彬，于二十二日下午在世界民主青年联盟理事会会议上发表演说。冯文彬指出：第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节，是世界青年在加强团结及保卫世界和平的斗争中的空前胜利。联欢节的影响非常巨大，在参加联欢节的各国代表回国传达联欢节的情形以后，这个影响将要更为扩大。中国青年将尽自己的一切力量，扩大和加深联欢节的影响。
    冯文彬说：联欢节对中国青年的意义是：它大大加强了中国青年和全世界青年对保卫世界和平的共同事业的决心和信念。通过这次联欢节，我们发现全世界各地都有为和平而奋斗的朋友。而中国青年代表团中的劳动模范和战斗英雄，特别是中国人民志愿军的青年代表，无论走到那里都受到热烈的欢迎和敬爱。其次，这次联欢节在促进各国青年的文化艺术交流上，起了重要作用。中国青年在这次联欢节中演出的文艺节目受到了欢迎，中国青年将更进一步加强他们在这方面的努力。
    冯文彬详尽叙述了中国人民在发展工农业生产，和教育工作上的卓越成就，特别是中华人民共和国成立以来中国青年在国家建设中所起的积极作用。冯文彬说：美国侵略者仇视我们的和平建设。他们走了日本帝国主义者的老路，首先侵略朝鲜、台湾，又把侵略战争扩展到中国边境。这样，远东和平以至全世界和平都受到了威胁。中国人民负起了为和平而斗争的严重任务，组织了中国人民志愿军，和朝鲜人民军并肩抵抗侵略者。中国人民知道：援助朝鲜就是保卫我们的祖国，也就是保卫远东和全世界的和平。
    冯文彬强调指出：自从朝鲜战争开始以来，中国人民就一贯主张和平解决朝鲜问题。在目前的停火谈判中，美国故意拖延，制造人为的障碍，表明了他们并无和平诚意。但是，正如中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军所说：“如果对方并没有和平诚意、故意提出无理要求，致使和谈失败，那么，战争的形势对于对方就不会是美妙的。”
    冯文彬痛斥美国重新武装西德和日本和排除中华人民共和国单独对日媾和的阴谋，指出美帝国主义的迷梦将来一定会在爱好和平的各国人民面前遭到彻底的失败。
    冯文彬最后说：中国青年的团结正日益扩大和加强。中国新民主主义青年团团员人数已经达到四百三十万人。中国青年将与世界青年一道坚决地站在世界民主青年联盟的旗帜下，学习苏联共产主义青年团的榜样，为持久和平与青年的美好的将来而斗争。
    冯文彬演说完毕后，代表中国青年把中国新民主主义青年团团旗一面、中国人民志愿军青年战士在朝鲜前线缴获的美国侵略者的炮弹壳制成的花瓶一个、织有联欢节徽饰的毯子一条献给世界民主青年联盟。
