She is a model worker of the first rank in the Lushun-Dalian area, a representative of the Northeast People's Congress, and a member of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union.

    戚桂芝是旅大地区第一个参加重工业生产的女镟盘工。她在一九四七年冬进入大连铁路工厂当学徒。她苦学了六个月之后，就成为一个熟练的镟盘工人；八个月后，她就能带徒弟了。她是旅大地区的一等劳动模范，东北人民代表大会的代表，和中国铁路工会全国委员会的委员。这是戚桂芝同志（右）正在教徒弟掌握镟床，使用削切法的情形。
