　　County People's Representative Meetings That Were Not Held Properly Must Be Reviewed

Convening people's representative meetings at all levels is a fundamental task in building a people's democratic government. In recent years, this work has been carried out in various parts of the country and has achieved great success. It has further strengthened the ties between the government and the people, and has powerfully promoted major tasks such as economic recovery, national defense construction, and land reform. Especially in the process of vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries, it has fully demonstrated the powerful strength and superiority of the people's democratic government. However, according to the key investigation recently conducted in the North China region in preparation for the first county head meeting, we can clearly see that the work of the people's representative meetings in some counties, such as Huolu County in Hebei Province, Xin County in Shanxi Province, and Ying County in Chahar Province, has serious shortcomings (see report on page 3 of today's newspaper). These shortcomings should be given attention not only in North China but throughout the country, and should be corrected quickly.

The most serious shortcoming is that in these counties, there are many deviations in the understanding of the people's representative meeting as a state system, and the understanding of its nature, role, and basic tasks is very inconsistent. Among the 332 counties in North China, those that convened county people's representative meetings last year and in the first half of this year held meetings as many as six or seven times, and as few as one or two times, with an average of about four times per county. Before May of this year, half of the 132 counties in Hebei Province had not held meetings; although most of them had been convened in June, 24 counties still had not held meetings. This shows that many counties still do not regard the people's representative meeting as a fundamental state system. Many counties have convened people's representative meetings solely to arrange central tasks such as taxation and production, and have not discussed and dealt with many other important proposals from the people's representatives; in some cases, there were twice or even several times more non-voting cadres than representatives present; some people's representative meetings have completely become "all-in-one" meetings, with representatives "challenging each other to competitions"; some meetings have many reports and little discussion. Therefore, some representatives satirize this kind of meeting as "I say, you obey" and "only resolutions, no discussions." In short, such people's representative meetings are becoming or have already become ordinary cadre meetings, seriously weakening the democratic life of the people. Huolu County in Hebei Province is a county that has convened a people's congress (whether the conditions for convening a people's congress in the county are ripe is not discussed here), and the majority of people's representatives' reflection on the people's congress is that it is "no different from a cadre meeting" and that "meetings are just about asking the masses for things." The representatives have become merely those who convey orders to the masses. Therefore, each time they attend a meeting, they only feel that they are there "to accept tasks" instead of representing the masses, so that their interest in attending meetings is decreasing day by day, and the number of absentees is increasing. The number of proposals has also decreased from several hundred at the beginning to only about twenty now. This phenomenon shows that the county's convening of the people's representative meeting is not for the purpose of realizing the democratization of state power, nor for strengthening and consolidating the basic system for the people to exercise state power, but simply for the purpose of carrying out certain administrative tasks. This is a serious error in ideological understanding. With this kind of erroneous understanding, unreasonable phenomena such as the all-encompassing substitution by leading cadres, neglect of the people's democratic rights, and lack of attention to handling the people's own affairs emerge one after another. If this situation is allowed to develop, it will gradually weaken or lose the role of the people's representative organ as an organ of power, which cannot be allowed.

The people's representative meetings convened in Ying County and Xin County also have the same serious shortcomings. This similarly shows that the governments and leading cadres of these counties do not pay attention to the work of political power construction, and their work style is not serious or democratic. For example, the county government arbitrarily discarded the list of representatives and mass proposals; the master of ceremonies of the meeting dared to arbitrarily announce the cancellation of the qualifications of 38 representatives; even controlled secret agents became representatives (the Huolu County People's Congress has a so-called "natural presidium," the error of which is the same.); attendees also participated in the presidium of the congress; they also monopolized the election and regarded the people's representatives as lower-level cadres, summoning them to come and dismissing them at will. These phenomena are obviously also unacceptable.

Our state power belongs to the people, and the people's democratic rights are inviolable. Without fully developing the people's democracy, the people's representative meeting will certainly not be established practically, but only formally, and it will certainly be politically and organizationally unsound and incomplete.

At present, the vast majority of counties in North China, that is, about 80% of the counties in the region, have the conditions, and will quickly exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress, which means that the construction work of our people's democratic government will be greatly promoted and elevated. However, if the above-mentioned shortcomings are not overcome, then even if the functions and powers of the people's congress are exercised, the people's democratic government will still not be strengthened and improved in practice. Isn't it a clear proof that nine counties in Hebei Province have already convened people's congresses, but have still not strengthened the people's democratic political life?

Therefore, in places where people's representative meetings have not been held properly, their leading organs and leading cadres must conduct in-depth investigations, must earnestly study and implement the important instructions in Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Meeting, and resolutely correct the serious deviations currently existing in the work of building a democratic government. As early as January 1934, Chairman Mao pointed out in his article "Concern Ourselves with the Well-Being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work" (see this newspaper on July 31): "All practical problems in the lives of the masses are problems that we should pay attention to. If we pay attention to these problems, solve them, and satisfy the needs of the masses, we will truly become the organizers of the lives of the masses, and the masses will truly rally around us and warmly support us." Shouldn't Chairman Mao's instructions arouse our serious attention?

The current people's representative meeting is the basic system of our country, and it must manage the affairs of the people's country and all the common affairs in the daily lives of the people. By earnestly solving the common problems in the daily lives of the people through the people's representative meeting, it will also further enhance the people's enthusiasm for managing state affairs. This is an important link in holding a good people's representative meeting. We must give full play to the role of the people's representative meeting and resolutely overcome the erroneous ideological and undemocratic style of formalism regarding the people's representative meeting. We believe that the leading organs in various places should seriously check the work of the people's representative meeting, and places where the people's representative meeting has not been held properly should conduct reviews and put forward suggestions for improvement in the future, so that the construction of our people's democratic government can have further development.

### 县人民代表会议没有开好的必须检讨

　　县人民代表会议没有开好的必须检讨
    召开各级人民代表会议，是人民民主政权建设的一项基本工作。近年来，这项工作在全国各地已有开展，并有很大成绩。它进一步地密切了政府与人民的联系，有力地推动了恢复经济、建设国防、实行土地改革等项重大任务。尤其是在大张旗鼓镇压反革命过程中，更充分地显示了人民民主政权的强大力量和优越性。但是，根据华北地区最近为准备召开首次县长会议所进行的重点调查，我们显然可以看到，有若干县份，如河北省获鹿县、山西省忻县及察哈尔省应县等的人民代表会议工作，是有严重缺点的（见本报今日第三版报道）。这些缺点，不仅在华北，即在全国各地，都应该加以重视，并迅速加以纠正。
    最严重的缺点在于这些县份，对于人民代表会议，作为国家制度，在认识上有不少偏差，对于它的性质、作用及其基本任务的了解，很不一致。华北三百三十二县，在去年一年和今年上半年中，召开县人民代表会议的，多者六七次，少者一两次，平均每县约有四次左右。河北省在今年五月份以前，在全省一百三十二县中，曾有一半县份没有开会；六月份虽已大都召开了，还有二十四个县仍然没有开会。这说明不少的县份，对于人民代表会议仍然没有把它当做国家的根本制度来看待。还有很多县份所召开的人民代表会议，单纯地布置征收和生产等中心工作，对于来自人民群众的许多代表的其他重要提案，却没有加以讨论与处理；甚至于有的列席干部，比出席代表多了一倍以至数倍；有的人民代表会议完全变成了“一揽子”会，代表相互“挑战竞赛”；有的会议报告很多，讨论很少。因此，有的代表讽刺这种会议是“我说你服”、“光决不议”。总之，这样的人民代表会议，正在变成或已经变成了普通的干部会，严重地削弱了人民的民主生活。河北省获鹿县是一个召开了人民代表大会的县份（该县召开人民代表大会条件是否成熟，这里姑且不论），多数人民代表对代表大会的反映是“与干部会没啥分别”，“开会就是向群众要东西”。代表们成了只是向群众传达命令的。因而他们每次出席会议，只觉得是“为接受任务”来的，而不是代表人民群众来的，以致他们出席会议的兴趣日益冷淡，缺席者日益增多。提案也由最初每次几百件，减少到现在每次只有二十余件了。这种现象说明该县召开人民代表会议，不是为了实现国家政权的民主化，不是为了加强与巩固人民行使国家政权的基本制度，而是单纯地为了执行某些行政工作任务。这是思想认识上的严重错误。有了这种错误认识，领导干部的包办代替，忽视人民民主权力，不注意处理人民自己的事务等不合理的现象，便层出不穷。这种情况如果任它发展下去，就将使人民代表机关，逐渐减弱或丧失其为权力机关的作用，这是不能容许的。
    应县和忻县所召开的人民代表会议也有同样的严重缺点。这同样说明了这些县份的政府和党的领导干部，对于政权建设工作是不重视的，他们的工作作风不严肃、不民主。例如：县政府竟任意丢掉了代表的名单和群众提案；会议的司仪人员，竟敢任意宣布取消三十八名代表资格；被管制的特务分子竟然也当了代表（获鹿县人民代表大会有所谓“当然主席团”，其错误与此相同。）；列席的人也参加了大会主席团；他们还包办选举，并把人民代表看成下级干部，召之使来，挥之使去。这些现象，显然也都是不能容许的。
    我们的国家政权是属于人民的，人民的民主权利是不可侵犯的。没有充分发扬人民的民主，人民代表会议就一定不能实际地，而只能是形式地建立起来，它在政治上和组织上一定是不健全的和不完备的。
    目前，华北绝大多数县份，即占全区约百分之八十左右县份的人民代表会议，都有条件，并且都将迅速地代行人民代表大会的职权，这就意味着我们的人民民主政权的建设工作将大大地推进一步，提高一步。但是，如果不克服上述的缺点，那末，即便代行了代表大会职权，而人民民主政权在实际上仍然不可能加强与提高起来。河北省有九个县已经召开了人民代表大会，仍然没有加强人民的民主政治生活，这不是很明显的证明吗？
    因此，凡是没有开好人民代表会议的地方，其领导机关和领导干部都必须进行深入的检查，必须认真地研究与贯彻刘少奇副主席在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话中的各项重要指示，坚决纠正目前存在于民主政权建设工作中的严重偏向。远在一九三四年一月，毛主席在《关心群众生活、注意工作方法》（见七月三十一日本报）一文中，就已经指出：“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。假如我们对这些问题注意了，解决了，满足了群众的需要，我们就真正成了群众生活的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”毛主席的指示，难道还不应当引起我们的郑重注意吗？
    现在的人民代表会议，是我们国家的基本制度，它必须管理人民国家的事务和人民日常生活中的一切共同的事务。通过人民代表会议认真地解决了人民日常生活中的共同问题，也就会更加增进人民管理国家事务的积极性。这是开好人民代表会议的一个重要环节。我们要把人民代表会议的作用，充分地发挥起来，坚决克服对于人民代表会议的形式主义的错误思想和不民主的作风。我们认为，各地领导机关都应该认真检查关于人民代表会议的工作，没有开好人民代表会议的地方，都应该进行检讨，并提出今后改进的意见，使我们人民民主政权的建设有进一步的发展。
