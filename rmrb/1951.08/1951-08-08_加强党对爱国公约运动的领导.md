　　Strengthen the Party's Leadership over the Patriotic Compact Movement

　　The Patriotic Compact Movement is developing into a sustained and regular movement. This movement has an extremely broad mass character. It embodies the common demands of people from all walks of life in politics, production, and work. It is becoming an unparalleled powerful force inspiring the people of the whole country to defend and build our great motherland.
    
　　The signing of patriotic compacts is an important method created by the masses of the people in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to unite and educate themselves. Experience over the past year has proven that grasping this important form of self-education for the masses of the people, and striving to promote this form among the masses of the people, is one of the basic methods for our Party to lead the people in consolidating our great motherland under the great banner of patriotism. The working experience of Party organizations in various places over the past year has proven that where attention is paid to carrying out political work among the people, conducting in-depth education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and mobilizing the masses to consciously sign and implement patriotic compacts on the political basis of patriotism, the people's political awareness and revolutionary enthusiasm are greatly improved, and all work there takes a big step forward with a new look. Conversely, where patriotic propaganda and education work is not earnestly carried out among the people, and the method of signing and implementing patriotic compacts is not used to consolidate the results of this propaganda and education work, and to make this propaganda and education lasting and regular, the people's political awareness and revolutionary enthusiasm cannot be significantly improved, and all work there cannot be smoothly advanced because it does not receive the conscious and active support of the people. This is already a theorem. On the whole, due to the widespread implementation of patriotic compacts throughout the country, the work of our country and the ideological outlook of the people have become greatly different from before. After the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea issued the call to launch a movement to increase production and income and donate airplanes and cannons in early June, more than 2,200 airplanes have been donated nationwide in two months. Many factories have combined patriotic compacts with labor competitions, and production has rapidly increased, with various new records appearing continuously. Once the state's various calls are put forward, they are quickly and consciously supported by the masses. The fact that 330,000 students signed up for the military cadre school enrollment this time is a vivid example. Many people say: "After signing the patriotic compact, every time I do something, I think about whether it conforms to the patriotic compact, and I think about the country and Chairman Mao." Others say: "As soon as I hear the state's call, I think about the responsibilities I should bear."

　　At present, although the Patriotic Compact Movement has achieved significant results in most parts of the country, the development of this movement is still very uneven. Generally speaking: the Patriotic Compact Movement in large and medium-sized cities has been carried out better, the publicity is more in-depth, and the movement has moved towards in-depth and consolidation stages through continuous inspection and revision of the compacts; small cities and rural areas are worse; remote areas are even worse. The number of people signing the compacts in large and medium-sized cities, according to statistics from Nanjing and Beijing, generally reaches 60 percent of the total population. But it is worth noting that in some areas, only cadres call for signing patriotic compacts, without serious deliberation and discussion by the masses from the bottom up. There are even cases in some rural areas of forced signing of patriotic compacts. In some areas, after the compacts are signed, they do not lead the people to conduct regular inspections and earnest implementation. Where these deviations exist, the patriotic compacts become things that exist in name only, and fail to achieve the purpose of organizing and educating the masses.

　　Why have these deviations occurred in some areas? The main reason is that the Party organizations and some cadres in these areas have not fully understood the great political significance of leading the people to promote patriotic compacts, and have not recognized that the patriotic ideology of the masses is a huge force for promoting all work, and therefore have not stood in front of the masses' patriotic movement to lead the masses, and even more or less abandoned leadership in the movement. This error in understanding must be quickly corrected.

　　Some people believe: "Everyone is responsible for patriotism, and the content of the compact is the people's obligation to the country; since it is something that should be done, just call on them to do it, why bother with publicity and mobilization?" These comrades do not understand that all Party work involving the majority of the masses must be fully publicized and mobilized; without propaganda and education, it is impossible to form a conscious mass movement. Patriotic compacts are the people's conscious actions of patriotism, but Party organizations cannot therefore abandon political work among the masses and abandon leadership. Since patriotic compacts are the basic form for the masses to supervise each other and conduct self-education, Party organizations have the responsibility to educate the people to raise their patriotic ideology, so that everyone knows the responsibility they should bear to the motherland.

　　"Patriotic compacts are not the central task, but an optional and dispensable supplementary work." This is a more common misconception among some cadres. Some Party workers in enterprise departments are only willing to engage in economic accounting and are unwilling to lead the work of patriotic compacts. Some comrades in the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant believe that signing patriotic compacts is troublesome and does not help in practice. Therefore, they delegate the leadership responsibility for the Patriotic Compact Movement to the Communist Youth League. Among rural cadres, the idea of "fear that patriotic compacts will delay production" has also arisen. In fact, the experiences of various places have long proven that patriotic compacts can and should be fully combined with the mass production movement, and become an important weapon for improving the thinking of the masses and promoting production. It is not patriotic compacts that hinder production, but the erroneous thinking of some cadres who mechanically separate patriotic compacts from the production movement. They leave the specific situation and specific requirements of the masses and engage in patriotic compacts in a vacuum, making the patriotic compacts lose their practical action significance. Such patriotic compacts can of course only become optional and dispensable things.

　　"Patriotic compacts are a shock task. Anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea propaganda and education were widely carried out around 'May Day', compacts were signed, and now there is nothing to do." This complacency is relatively common in areas where the patriotic movement has been carried out better in the past. One result of this erroneous thinking is to make the leadership lag behind the demands of the masses. They did not check and revise the patriotic compacts on the basis of the improvement of the masses' thinking, and did not quickly guide the masses to strengthen production, learning, and other work after the climax; they did not combine the patriotic compacts with increasing production and donations. They regarded this movement as a "shock" task, so they did not make it regular, but instead thought that there was nothing to do. This should be changed immediately.

　　"Leading patriotic compacts is a matter for mass organizations and the Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and Party organizations can ignore it." This is another erroneous argument. It should be pointed out that continuing to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is the top political task in all Party work. The Korean War is still continuing, and U.S. imperialism has not expressed its sincerity for peace. Moreover, U.S. imperialists are stepping up their activities to separately conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan. They have expressed their intention to continue to occupy our territory of Taiwan and refused to discuss the issue of withdrawing foreign troops from Korea at the Korean armistice talks. Therefore, even if the armistice in Korea becomes a reality, the security of our country is still threatened by U.S. aggressors. Therefore, we must continue to mobilize the strength of the entire nation, build a strong national defense, and prepare to deal with any conspiracy attack by imperialism. This is the basic prerequisite for guaranteeing the independence and peaceful construction of our country. Striving for this is the top political task of our Party and the people of the whole country. The Party organizations at all levels must organize the people of all strata and all corners of the country on one front and move towards such a combat goal. Patriotic compacts are precisely the most appropriate form to realize this requirement, to combine political tasks with economic tasks, and to combine the overall tasks of the country with various specific work tasks. The Party's leading organs should strengthen the leadership of the local branches of the Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and at the same time consciously combine all work with the Patriotic Compact Movement.

　　Regularly checking and revising patriotic compacts is an important guarantee for making patriotic compacts fully play the role of organizing and educating the masses and promoting the progress of various practical tasks. At present, many units in the Northeast provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hebei, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, Shandong, Zhejiang, Northern Anhui, Fujian, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Eastern Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, Northern Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Western Kang and other provinces and regions, and Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing and other cities, have already or are checking the patriotic compacts in accordance with the call of the July 4th communique of the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Among them, Hebei Province and Nanjing City have universally checked the implementation of patriotic compacts in June and July. But there are still many places and many units that have not carried out the inspection work of patriotic compacts. In all places where this inspection work has not been carried out or has not been completed, the Party organizations must cooperate with the local branches of the Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to seriously and universally check the signing and implementation of patriotic compacts in August, and combine it with the current various tasks to lead the masses of the people to universally sign or revise patriotic compacts. In the inspection, special attention should be paid to criticizing various erroneous understandings of patriotic compacts among cadres and activists inside and outside the Party. This is a decisive link in continuing to lead the Patriotic Compact Movement in-depth. In the mass movement to revise patriotic compacts, the Party organizations must mobilize all Party members to play an exemplary role, and Party members and cadres must implement the patriotic compacts together with the masses, and correct the erroneous view of some Party members or cadres that patriotic compacts are only compacts for the general masses. The experiences gained by various places in the work of checking and revising patriotic compacts should be published in newspapers to promote the widespread development of this work. We also hope that the propaganda departments of the Party committees of various provinces and cities will sort out the general and typical situations and experiences of the provinces and cities in promoting patriotic compacts before the first half of September and send them to this newspaper for publication. In short, leading the masses of the people to sign and implement patriotic compacts is one of the important political tasks of the entire Party. The Party organizations in various places must organize the vanguard and the broad masses together through patriotic compacts, so as to effectively lead the masses of the people to strive to realize the common demands in the patriotic compacts.

### 加强党对爱国公约运动的领导

　　加强党对爱国公约运动的领导
    爱国公约运动正在发展成为持久的经常的运动。这个运动有着极其广大的群众性，它体现了各阶层人民群众在政治上、生产上和工作上的共同要求，它正在成为鼓舞全国人民保卫和建设伟大祖国的无比强大的力量。
    订立爱国公约是人民群众在抗美援朝运动中所创造出来用以团结和教育自己的重要方法。一年来的经验证明，抓住这一个人民群众进行自我教育的重要形式，努力在人民群众中推广这种形式，是我们党领导人民在爱国主义的伟大旗帜下巩固我们伟大的祖国的基本方法之一。一年来各地党的工作经验证明：那里注意对人民群众进行政治工作，深入进行抗美援朝教育，并发动群众自觉地在爱国主义的政治基础上订立和执行爱国公约，那里人民的政治觉悟和革命积极性就大大提高，那里的一切工作就大踏步地前进，面貌一新。反之，那里不认真地进行对人民群众的爱国主义宣传教育工作，并用订立和执行爱国公约的办法来把这种宣传教育工作的成果巩固起来，并使这种宣传教育持久化经常化，那里人民的政治觉悟和革命积极性就得不到显著的提高，那里的一切工作就因为得不到人民的自觉的积极的拥护而不能顺利地推进。这已经是一个定理了。整个来说，由于爱国公约在全国的广泛推行，我们国家的工作和人民的思想面貌已大不同前了。六月初抗美援朝总会发出开展爱国增产增加收入捐献飞机大炮运动的号召后，在两个月的时间内，全国捐献飞机已达二千二百余架。许多工厂把爱国公约同劳动竞赛结合起来，生产即迅速提高，连续出现了各种新纪录。国家的各种号召，一经提出，就迅速得到群众的自觉拥护。这次军事干部学校招生，有三十三万学生报名，便是一个鲜明的例证。许多人都说：“订了爱国公约后，每逢做一件事就想到合不合爱国公约，就想到国家和毛主席。”又说：“一听到国家号召，就想到自己应当担当的责任。”
    目前爱国公约运动在全国大部分地区虽然都取得了重大的成绩，但是这个运动的发展还是十分不平衡的，一般的是：大、中城市爱国公约运动开展得较好，宣传比较深入，经过不断地检查和修订公约，运动已走向深入和巩固阶段；小城市和农村较差；边远的地区更差。大、中城市订约的人数，据南京市、北京市统计，一般都达到了总人口的百分之六十。但值得注意的是有些地区，只由干部号召订爱国公约，而没有认真地经过群众自下而上的酝酿和讨论，甚至于有些农村竟然发现有强迫订立爱国公约的现象。有些地区公约订立之后，即不去领导人民群众定期检查认真执行。有这些偏向存在的地方，爱国公约都变为有名无实的东西，而达不到组织群众和教育群众的目的。
    为什么有些地区发生了这些偏向呢？主要原因是在这些地区党的组织以及某些干部没有充分了解领导人民推行爱国公约的伟大政治意义，没有认识到群众性的爱国主义思想是推进一切工作的巨大力量，因而也就没有站在群众爱国运动的前面去领导群众，甚至在运动中或多或少地放弃了领导。这种认识上的错误必须迅速加以纠正。
    有人认为：“爱国人人有责，公约的内容是人民对国家应尽的义务；既然是应作的事情，号召他们作就是了，何必宣传动员？”这些同志不了解，一切党的涉及多数群众的工作都必须进行充分的宣传和动员；没有宣传教育，就不可能形成一个自觉的群众运动。爱国公约是人民爱国的自觉的行动，但党的组织并不能因此便可以放弃对群众的政治工作，放弃领导。既然爱国公约是群众互相监督进行自我教育的基本形式，党的组织就有责任教育人民提高爱国主义思想，使每一个人都知道自己对祖国应负的责任。
    “爱国公约不是中心工作，是可有可无的附带的工作。”这是在一部分干部中比较普遍的错误认识。有些企业部门党的工作者只愿意搞经济核算，不愿意领导爱国公约工作。北京石景山钢铁厂的某些同志认为订爱国公约是麻烦事，并且无补于实际，因此，他们把爱国公约运动的领导责任委托给青年团。在农村干部中，也发生了“怕爱国公约会耽误生产”的想法。其实，各地经验早已证明：爱国公约同群众的生产运动完全可以也应该互相结合起来，成为提高群众思想和推进生产的重要武器。妨碍生产的不是爱国公约而是某些干部把爱国公约同生产运动机械分开的错误思想。他们离开了群众的具体情况和具体要求，空洞地去搞爱国公约，使爱国公约失去了实际的行动意义，这样的爱国公约当然就只能成为可有可无的东西了。
    “爱国公约是突击任务，‘五一’前后已经普遍进行了抗美援朝的宣传教育，订了公约，现在没有什么可做了。”这种自满情绪在过去爱国运动开展得较好的地区是比较普遍地存在着的。由于这种错误思想而造成的一个结果，就是使领导落后于群众的要求。他们没有在群众思想提高的基础上检查修订爱国公约，没有在高潮之后迅速引导群众去加强生产、学习等工作；没有把爱国公约同增产捐献结合起来。他们把这个运动看成是“突击”任务，因此没有使它经常化，反而认为没有什么可做了。这是应该立即改变的。
    “领导爱国公约是群众团体和抗美援朝会的事情，党的组织可以不管。”这又是一种错误论调。应当指出：继续加强抗美援朝运动，是党的一切工作中的头等政治任务。目前朝鲜战争仍在继续进行，美帝国主义还没有表示和平的诚意。而且美国帝国主义者正在加紧单独对日媾和及重新武装日本的活动，他们已经表示要继续霸占我国的领土台湾，并拒绝在朝鲜停战谈判会议中讨论从朝鲜撤退外国军队问题。因此，即使朝鲜的停战成为事实，我国的安全仍然受着美国侵略者的威胁。因此，我们就必须继续动员全民族的力量，建设强大的国防，准备对付帝国主义的任何阴谋袭击。这是保障我们国家独立与和平建设的基本前提，为此而奋斗就是我们党和全国人民的头等政治任务。我们党的各级组织必须把全国各个阶层和一切角落的人民组织在一条战线上，向着这样一个战斗目标前进。爱国公约正是实现这一要求，把政治任务同经济任务结合起来，把国家的总任务同各项具体工作任务结合起来的最适当的形式。党的领导机关应该加强对各地抗美援朝分会的领导，同时要有意识地使一切工作同爱国公约运动结合进行。
    定期地检查和修订爱国公约，是使爱国公约充分发挥组织和教育群众的作用，并推动各项实际工作前进的重要保证。目前，东北各省及内蒙自治区、河北、山西、绥远、察哈尔、山东、浙江、皖北、福建、苏南、苏北、陕西、甘肃、青海、河南、湖北、湖南、川东、川南、川西、川北、云南、贵州、西康等省区和北京、天津、南京、上海、西安、武汉、广州、重庆等城市的许多单位，已经或正在根据抗美援朝总会七月四日文告的号召，检查爱国公约。其中河北省和南京市已在六、七月间普遍地检查了爱国公约的执行情况。但是还有许多地方许多单位没有进行爱国公约的检查工作。凡是尚未进行或尚未完成这种检查工作的地方，党的组织都必须配合各地抗美援朝分会，在八月份内认真普遍地检查一次爱国公约的订立和执行情形，并与当前各项工作相结合，领导人民群众普遍订立或修订爱国公约。在检查中应当特别注意批判党内外干部和积极分子中对爱国公约的各种错误认识，这是继续把爱国公约运动引向深入的一个决定性的环节。在群众性的修订爱国公约的运动中，党的组织要动员全体党员起模范作用，党员和干部要同群众在一起共同执行爱国公约，纠正某些党员或干部认为爱国公约只是一般群众的公约的错误看法。各地在检查和修订爱国公约的工作中所取得的经验，应在报纸上发表，以便推动这一工作普遍开展。我们并希望各省、市党委宣传部，在九月上半月以前，把各省、市推行爱国公约的一般的和典型的情况和经验，加以整理，寄给本报发表。总之，领导人民群众订立和执行爱国公约是全党的重要政治任务之一，各地党的组织要通过爱国公约把先锋队同广大群众组织在一起，以便有效地领导人民群众为实现爱国公约中的共同的要求而奋斗。
