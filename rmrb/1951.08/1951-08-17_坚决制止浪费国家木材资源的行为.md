Resolutely Stop the Waste of National Timber Resources

　　The timber issue has now become one of the important issues nationwide. The State Council of the Central People's Government has specifically issued instructions on saving timber, calling on the people of the whole country to earnestly conserve timber and resolutely oppose all phenomena of timber waste. This instruction is timely because timber is one of the important resources for national production and construction. Our current situation is characterized by increasing demand, insufficient resources, and serious waste. If various timber waste phenomena are not corrected in time, they will have extremely adverse consequences for national construction work.

　　The most important aspects of the waste of timber resources are currently two: first, some local authorities indiscriminately log forests, and second, some organs and troops use timber as the primary object of their production.

　　Local governments solving local financial problems by indiscriminately logging forests poses the greatest threat to national timber resources. Based on the requirements of local finance, they often add to the state-arranged logging tasks in their jurisdiction, and some areas even log more than three times the state-arranged tasks. Some areas openly advocate "vigorous logging and vigorous operation to develop financial resources"; some areas openly request higher authorities to allow them to log "financial timber"; some areas, in order to obtain exorbitant profits from timber, do not hesitate to abuse administrative power and compulsorily purchase timber from private forests at low prices, then sell it at high prices, causing farmers to massively cut down forests; some areas, in order to demand high prices from industrial, mining, and transportation departments that need timber, have even caused some mines to stop work and wait for materials.

　　Another major threat to timber resources is that some organs, troops, and schools are engaged in large-scale timber business for the sake of their own production. They have taken many illegal measures by virtue of the power given to them by the state. For example, they privately sell timber allocated to them for their own use at high prices; for example, they engage in timber trade under the guise of construction; for example, they use the convenience of military and government organs to transport timber from the Northeast and other places into the interior; and even, in order to obtain huge profits, collude with illegal private merchants to cheat on purchasing licenses and allocate transportation vehicles. Some units openly snap up and hoard timber in the market, causing fluctuations in timber market prices, and the timber market is in a very chaotic situation. Under such circumstances, units that really need timber are not easy to get timber. This is very harmful to the construction cause.

　　The main reason for these serious phenomena is that some comrades have many confused ideas about the timber issue.

　　The first confused idea is that China's timber resources are very abundant, inexhaustible, and never considering the problem of timber shortage. In fact, according to general research, the forest area of ​​any country must account for more than 30% of the country's land area and be properly distributed in order to reduce natural disasters and meet the country's needs in terms of timber supply. However, China's forest area only accounts for 5% of the country's land area, and most of it is distributed in remote areas with inconvenient transportation and difficult development, so the timber supply is particularly lacking. In a few years, as the country's construction progresses, the number of timbers required will inevitably increase greatly compared to now. If we cannot practice strict economy with the only existing forest resources in our country, but waste and indiscriminately cut down them at will, the timber needs for our country's future industrial construction will definitely not be met. The reason why China's agriculture continues to suffer from water and drought disasters is also the result of insufficient forests.

　　The second confused idea is that they only see local interests and not overall interests. They only see that cutting down timber and trading timber are effective ways to solve local finance and agency production, but they do not see that doing so has caused and is causing serious harm to the country. For example, Beijing is one of the cities with the greatest benefits for timber traders, and there is a lot of timber piled up, but some factories and mines that need timber cannot get timber supply. Given the scarcity of timber resources in China and the large amount of demand, special attention should be paid to the existing timber resources, and they should be used in important aspects as much as possible, and serve the entire national economic construction in the most economical and rational way. Obviously, the interests of local finance and agency production are very small compared with the interests of the entire national economic construction. We should not harm the overall and long-term interests of the country for the sake of the current small interests of certain localities and certain agencies. Local interests should be subordinate to overall interests, and immediate interests should be subordinate

### 坚决制止浪费国家木材资源的行为

　　坚决制止浪费国家木材资源的行为
    木材问题，现在已成为全国的重要问题之一。中央人民政府政务院特为此发布了节约木材的指示，号召全国人民认真节约木材，坚决反对一切浪费木材的现象。这个指示是切合时宜的。因为木材是国家生产建设的重要资源之一，我们现时的情形是需要日广，资源不足，而浪费严重。各种浪费木材的现象，如不及时纠正，将对国家建设工作造成极为不良的后果。
    浪费木材资源的现象，目前最主要的有两个方面：第一是某些地方机关乱伐森林，第二是某些机关、部队以木材作为机关生产的主要对象。
    地方政府以滥伐森林为方法来解决地方财政问题，对国家木材资源是最大的威胁。从地方财政的要求出发，他们往往对所辖林区在国家布置的采伐任务之外，又大量加以采伐，有的地区的采伐量甚至比国家布置的任务大三倍以上。有的地区公开提倡“大力砍伐、大力经营来开发财源”；有的地区公开向上级请求，允许他们采伐“财政材”；有的地区为了从木材上获取暴利，不惜滥用行政权力，对私有林的木材以低价强制收购，然后以高价卖出，造成农民大批砍伐森林的现象；有的地区为了向需要木材的工矿交通部门索取高价，竟使某些矿山发生停工待料的现象。
    对木材资源另一个大的威胁，是某些机关、部队、学校，为了机关生产，大规模地作木材生意。他们凭借着国家付予它们的权力，采取了许多非法的措施。如把国家调拨给它们自用的木材私自以高价出卖；如以建筑为名作木材买卖；如利用军政机关的便利，由东北等地贩卖木材入关；甚至为了获取厚利，勾结非法私商，在购买许可证和调拨运输车辆等方面，通同作弊。有些单位公然在市场上抢购和囤积木材，造成木材市价波动，木材市场陷于非常混乱的局面。在这种情况下，真正需要木材的单位反而不容易得到木材。这对于建设事业是十分有害的。
    发生这些严重现象的主要原因，是有些同志对木材问题有许多糊涂思想。
    第一个糊涂思想是认为中国木材资源十分充足，可以取之不竭，用之不尽，根本就没有考虑过木材不足的问题。实际上，根据一般的研究，任何国家的森林面积必须占有国土面积百分之三十以上，还要分布适当，才能减免天然灾害，并在木材的供应上满足国家的需要。但我国森林面积仅占国土面积的百分之五，且多分布在偏僻地区，交通不便，开发困难，因而木材供应特感缺乏。再过几年之后，随着国家建设的进展，需要木材的数量，必然比现在要大大增加。如果我们对国家现时仅有的一些森林资源，不能厉行节约，而是随意浪费，滥加砍伐，对于我们国家今后工业建设上木材需要，是断然无法满足的。中国农业之所以不断发生水旱之灾，也正是森林不足的结果。
    第二个糊涂思想是只看到局部利益，没有看到整体利益。他们只看到砍伐木材和买卖木材是解决地方财政和机关生产的有效方法，而没有看到这样做已经和正在对国家造成了严重的恶果。例如北京市是木材买卖者得利最大的城市之一，木材堆积甚多，但有些必需木材的厂矿，却得不到木材的供应。以中国木材资源之不足，需要量之大，对于现有的木材资源应特别加意爱护，应尽量使之用于重要的方面，用最经济合理的方法，为整个国家经济建设服务。很显然，地方财政和机关生产的利益，若同整个国家经济建设的利益比较，是十分渺小的。我们不应该为了某些地方和某些机关目前的小的利益，而危害国家整体的和长远的利益。局部利益应服从整体利益，眼前利益应服从长远利益。
    第三个糊涂思想是不重视国家关于木材的法令。机关、部队、团体经营木材买卖是非法的，政府早有明文规定。但有些同志并不遵守这个规定，他们只图赚钱，把国家法令置于脑后。一九五○年一月五日政务院财政经济委员会发出了关于分配给各单位之使用木材均不得出卖的通知，一九五○年一月六日，政务院财政经济委员会又发出过关内各部及所属企业今后不得在东北采购木材的通知，一九五一年四月二十七日政务院财政经济委员会又发布了关于木材供应及收购问题的决定。所有这些法令，均未被严格遵守，这是完全不应当的。有些同志以政府允许机关部队从事“土产交流”为借口，认为经营木材买卖仍是合法的。须知“木材”非一般“土产”，而且政府早有规定，不能以此为非法贸易辩护。当然作这些违法贸易的干部中，并不是全都知道法律的。有些人是明知故犯，他们以为“赚钱反正是为公，犯点法，没关系。”于是理直气壮地从事木材买卖。另外有些人则是对自己业务有关的各种法令，素来采取不闻不问的态度，于是糊里糊涂地犯了法令。这两种人虽然表现形式不一样，其犯法则一。为了停止一切在木材问题上违反法令的现象，对于那些不遵守法令的人应给以适当的处分。政务院在节约木材的指示中，一再强调“违者依法论处”的原则，是完全必要的。
    反对浪费木材，是一个紧急的斗争任务。有关地区的党政领导机关，应根据政务院关于节约木材指示的精神，首先在干部中进行思想教育，展开思想批评，务使所有干部，都能了解我国木材资源缺乏的情况及森林对国家经济建设的重要性，反对狭隘的局部观点，制止一切违法乱纪的行为，把政务院这一指示贯彻到实际的行动中去。
