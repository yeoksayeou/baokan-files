Then, Park Young-sung, Chairman of the South Pyongan Provincial Party Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, gave a report to the participants commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day of the Chinese People's Forces. He first extended, on behalf of all the people of South Pyongan Province, the highest national salute to the great Chinese people who sincerely assisted the Korean people and to the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers who were bravely fighting on the Korean front.

After detailing the process of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, led by the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao, growing and becoming stronger in hardship and its experience of winning every battle, the reporter pointed out that the Chinese People's Volunteers, who came to the Korean battlefield holding high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect their homes and defend the country, learned and carried forward the fine traditions of the Chinese People's Forces of being brave and good at fighting, not fearing difficulties, strictly abiding by discipline, and loving the people. He said that the Chinese People's Volunteers not only shed blood and fought on the Korean front, but also sweated to help Korean farmers sow and transplant rice seedlings in the rear, and even used their own food to relieve the Korean war-stricken people, fully demonstrating the noble spirit of internationalism.

Subsequently, labor models Li Jong-ryul and Li Jong-hyun, youth representative Zhang Xuande, women representative Song De-ok, farmer representative Kim Ki-ui, and People's Army hero Park Gil-nam delivered congratulatory speeches in turn.

The meeting unanimously approved the congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao with thunderous applause (see separate telegram).

After the meeting, the People's Committee of South Pyongan Province hosted a banquet for all the representatives of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the National Art Theater performed celebratory programs.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 2nd: The text of the congratulatory telegram from the people of all walks of life in South Pyongan Province, Korea, celebrating the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to Chairman Mao is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

On the occasion of the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we would like to extend our warm and combative congratulations to you - the organizer and leader of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as all the commanders, combatants and heroic Chinese people of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

The Chinese People's powerful armed force - the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the entire Chinese people, under your wise leadership and that of the great Chinese Communist Party, have, over the past twenty-four years, undergone arduous revolutionary struggles, overthrown the Kuomintang reactionary regime, driven out the foreign imperialist invaders, and won a brilliant epoch-making victory in human history, causing the old China, full of oppression, humiliation and darkness, to collapse, and creating a new, free and unified People's China.

This great historical event has not only become a victorious banner of the national liberation movement in the Far East and Asia against the forces of imperialist aggression, but also a powerful force for maintaining world peace, security, and the independence and freedom of all nations, making the international democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union even more consolidated.

However, the common enemies of the people of Korea and China, the heinous enemies of all mankind - the American imperialists, in order to provoke a new world war, have fiercely carried out armed intervention on our country's territory, attempting to turn the Korean people into their colonial slaves and to turn Korea into a military base for their aggression against China and the whole of Asia, threatening world peace and security. Therefore, the peace-loving, freedom-loving and nationally prosperous people of Korea and China have risen up to wage a heroic struggle against the common enemy - the American imperialist aggressors, causing the enemy to suffer repeated defeats.

The people of Korea and China have fought together for common interests since long ago, especially during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the revolutionary blood of the two peoples flowed together. The friendship and solidarity formed by the revolutionary blood of the Korean and Chinese people has become even more consolidated in today's anti-American struggle and has become a force that cannot be destroyed by any aggressive force.

At the most serious time for the Korean people's struggle for their own national freedom and independence, you and the heroic Chinese people you led gave us fraternal combat support, strongly attacked the American aggressors, and strengthened our confidence in victory. Here we would like to express our deep gratitude and respect to you, and express our highest gratitude and honor to the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people - all the warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers who have displayed unparalleled heroic dedication and made great contributions on the Korean battlefield!

We firmly believe that the people of Korea and China will surely win the final victory in the anti-American struggle, guarantee the democratic development and future prosperity of the two peoples, and greatly contribute to the foundation of peace and freedom in the Far East, Asia, and the world.

For the prosperity of the People's China and world peace and security, we wish

You longevity!

The people of all circles in South Pyongan Province celebrate the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Pyongyang, July 31, 1951.

    大会在庄严的军乐声中开始，与会的各界人民代表首先热烈地向中国人民志愿军和人民军的勇士们献花致敬，接着由劳动党平安南道道党部委员长朴永成向与会者做了纪念中国人民部队“八一”建军节的报告。他首先代表平安南道全体人民向诚挚地援助朝鲜人民的伟大的中国人民和在朝鲜前线英勇战斗中的中国人民志愿军指战员致以崇高的民族的敬礼。他说：中国人民部队的建军节，不仅是中国人民热烈庆祝的节日，而且也是全世界爱好和平自由的千百万人民衷心祝贺的日子，特别是作为英雄的中国人民志愿军的亲密战友的我们以无限感激的心情来祝贺的日子。
    报告者在详述了以毛主席为首的中国共产党领导中国人民解放军在艰苦中成长壮大的经过和百战百胜的经验后，指出高举抗美援朝保家卫国正义旗帜而来到朝鲜战场的中国人民志愿军学习和发扬了中国人民部队英勇善战、不怕困难、严守纪律、热爱人民的优良传统。他说：中国人民志愿军不仅在朝鲜前线流血战斗，而且在朝鲜后方流汗帮助朝鲜农民播种插秧，更以自己的粮食救济朝鲜战地灾民，充分表现了崇高的国际主义精神。

    【新华社平壤二日电】朝鲜平安南道各界人民庆祝中国人民解放军建军二十四周年纪念大会给毛主席的贺电电文如下：敬爱的毛泽东主席：
    值此中国人民解放军建军二十四周年之际，我们谨向您——英勇的中国人民解放军的组织者和领导者，暨中国人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员和英雄的中国人民，致以热烈的战斗的祝贺！
    中国人民强大的武装力量——中国人民解放军和全中国人民，在英明的您和伟大的中国共产党的领导下，二十四年来经过艰苦的革命斗争，推翻了国民党反动政权，驱逐了外国帝国主义侵略者，争取了在人类历史上灿烂的划时代的胜利，使充满压迫、屈辱与黑暗的旧中国崩溃，创建了新的自由统一的人民中国。
    这一伟大的历史性的事变，不仅成为远东及亚洲反对帝国主义侵略势力的民族解放运动的胜利旗帜，而且成为维护世界和平安全与各民族独立自由的强大力量，使得以伟大的苏联为首的国际民主阵营更加巩固起来了。
    但是朝、中两国人民不共戴天的仇敌、全人类的凶恶敌人——美帝国主义者，为了挑拨新的世界大战，在我国疆土上凶恶地进行了武装干涉，妄图变朝鲜人民为其殖民地奴隶，变朝鲜为其侵略中国及整个亚洲的军事基地，威胁着世界的和平安全，因此，热爱和平自由与民族繁荣的朝、中两国人民，奋起进行了英勇斗争，反抗共同敌人——美帝国主义侵略者，使仇敌节节遭到失败。
    朝、中两国人民从很早以前就为了共同利益而一起斗争，特别是在抗日战争中，两国人民的革命鲜血曾流在一起。朝、中两国人民以革命鲜血结成的友谊团结，在今天的抗美斗争中，更加巩固而成为任何侵略势力所不能摧毁的力量了。
    在朝鲜人民为自己祖国自由独立而斗争的最严重的时期，您和您所领导的英雄的中国人民，给予了我们以兄弟般的战斗的支援，强有力地打击了美国侵略者，加强了我们的胜利信心。这里我们谨向您致以深深的感谢和敬意，谨向在朝鲜战场上发挥无比的英勇献身精神、立下伟大功勋的中国人民优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军全体勇士们致以崇高的谢意和荣誉！
    我们深信朝、中两国人民一定能够赢得抗美斗争的最后胜利，保障两国人民的民主发展和未来的繁荣，并大大地有助于远东、亚洲及世界和平与自由的奠定。
    为了人民中国的繁荣和世界和平安全，谨祝
    您万寿无疆！
    平安南道各界人民庆祝中国人民解放军建军二十四周年纪念大会。一九五一年七月三十一日平壤市。
