　　The U.S. Lacks Sincerity for Peace
　　Continues to Coerce Vassal States to Increase Troops for Aggression Against Korea During Ceasefire Negotiations
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 4th] While the Korean armistice negotiations are in progress, the U.S. aggressors continue to coerce their vassal states to send more troops to Korea. This fact proves that the U.S. lacks sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue.
　　Under the instruction of the United States, United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie distributed a call to the governments of all UN member states on June 23, requesting them to send additional reinforcements to continue the war of aggression against Korea, urging governments to "seriously consider this appeal". He also personally went to European countries to extort cannon fodder for the U.S. aggressors.
　　Under the pressure of the United States, some vassal states have shamefully agreed to send more troops to participate in the war of aggression against Korea. Thailand recently sent a combat unit of more than 850 soldiers, a small number of naval personnel, and a squadron of air transport aircraft. A group of Canadian troops, including infantry, engineers, armor, logistics troops and an ambulance station, arrived at the British Commonwealth Forces training station in Kure, Japan, in mid-July, awaiting orders to go to Korea. Norway announced on July 16 that it would send a battalion of troops. France also sent more than 180 officers and soldiers to reinforce the French troops invading Korea. They departed from Marseille, France, on July 17. Four hundred Greek reinforcements also left Athens on July 29 aboard a U.S. transport ship.

　　美方缺乏和平诚意
    停战谈判期间继续胁迫仆从国家增兵侵朝
    【新华社四日讯】在朝鲜停战谈判进行期间，美国侵略者继续胁迫其仆从国家向朝鲜增派军队。这一事实证明了美国对于和平解决朝鲜问题缺乏诚意。
    联合国秘书长赖伊奉美国之命，曾于六月二十三日向联合国各会员国政府分发美国要求增派援军以继续进行侵朝战争的呼吁书，要求各国政府“认真考虑这个呼吁”。他并且亲往欧洲各国活动，为美国侵略者勒索炮灰。
    在美国的压力下，若干仆从国家已经可耻地答应增派军队参加侵朝战争。泰国在最近又派出八百五十余名士兵的战斗部队，一小部分海军人员和一队空军运输机。加拿大军一批包括步兵、工兵、装甲兵和后勤兵和一个救护站，已于七月中旬抵达在日本吴港的英联邦军训练站，待命开往朝鲜。挪威于七月十六日宣布将派出一营军队。法国又派出一百八十余名军官、士兵增援侵朝法军，他们已经在七月十七日自法国马赛启程，希腊援军四百名亦已在七月二十九日搭美国运输舰离开雅典。
