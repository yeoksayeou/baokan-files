　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd: This reporter learned from the headquarters at the Korean front that the 18th meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations was held at 10:00 AM (Korean time) on August 3rd. At 12:50 PM, the United Nations Command delegation suggested a recess, and the 19th meeting was scheduled for 10:00 AM on August 4th.

　　General Nam Il, chief representative of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, continued to refute the absurd proposal put forward by the other side at the 18th meeting, which suggested drawing the military demarcation line north of the 38th parallel, in front of our existing front line positions. General Nam Il systematically and thoroughly pointed out that any theory exaggerating the effectiveness of aerial and naval bombardment, as well as the excuses emphasizing so-called military defense positions and ensuring the safety of troops, are illogical and untenable, and cannot conceal the other side's attempt to gain a favorable operational position. Based on the characteristics and trends of the Korean battlefield, General Nam Il fully and forcefully explained that our proposal to establish the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line is not only in line with the military reality of the current stage of the Sino-Korean battlefield and is fair and reasonable to both sides, but will also be more conducive to the comprehensive peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

　　朝鲜停战谈判第十八次会议
    南日将军继续驳斥美方案
    重申确立三八线为军事分界线的合理主张
    【新华社平壤三日电】本社记者自朝鲜前线总部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议第十八次会议在八月三日上午十时（朝鲜时间）举行，十二时五十分联合国军代表团建议休会，第十九次会议定于八月四日上午十时举行。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军，在第十八次会议上继续驳斥了对方所提议的将军事分界线划定在三八线以北现有战线前方我方阵地的荒谬方案。南日将军有系统地深入地提出：任何夸炫海空军狂轰滥炸的效能的理论，以及强调所谓军事防御阵地和保证部队安全的借口，都是不合逻辑、站不住脚的，更不能掩饰对方企图取得有利作战地位的目的。南日将军并根据朝鲜战场特点和趋势，充分有力地说明了：确立三八线为双方军事分界线的我方方案，不但符合于现阶段中朝鲜战场的军事实际，对双方都公平合理，而且更将有利于朝鲜问题的全面和平解决。
