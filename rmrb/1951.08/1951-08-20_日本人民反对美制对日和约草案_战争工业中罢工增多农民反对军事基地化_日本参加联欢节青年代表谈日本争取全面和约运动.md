　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 19th: The Electrification News Agency, Berlin, 17th: Taro Natsume, a representative of Japan participating in the World Youth Festival, told Electrification News Agency reporters: "We have always advocated a peaceful resolution to the Korean War. However, the Japanese people clearly know that the United States is still continuing to prepare for a third world war. The best proof is the American-made draft peace treaty with Japan and the U.S. demand in the Kaesong negotiations to draw the demarcation line several kilometers north of the 38th parallel."
    Natsume said: "The Japanese people oppose the American-made draft peace treaty with Japan for three main reasons: First, we oppose the stationing of American troops in Japan and turning our country into a military base for aggression; second, we do not want to be cannon fodder in the war that the United States is preparing to wage against the people of other Asian countries; third, if the American-made treaty is signed, the state of war between Japan and China and the Soviet Union will still exist."
    Natsume described the Japanese people's resistance to the United States using Japan as a war base and arsenal. He said: Labor unrest in the war industry is spreading widely. For example, workers in many Japanese factories are refusing to produce napalm. An airplane factory manufactured a batch of gasoline tanks for airplanes, but they were all unusable. Once, the U.S. military installed anti-aircraft guns in a forest on the western outskirts of Tokyo, so the farmers sawed down all the trees nearby. The American aggression against Korea has brought huge disasters to the Japanese people. Since the outbreak of the Korean War, prices have risen by 60 percent. There are three million people who are long-term unemployed or short-term unemployed. Due to American grain dumping, most farmers have gone bankrupt. Although strikes are prohibited, two million people have participated in strikes since the beginning of this year. In these strikes, union members have forced right-leaning union leaders to support the strikes.
    Natsume said: Japanese youth are actively participating in the Japanese people's struggle to strive for a comprehensive peace treaty, independence, and democracy. Thirty percent of Japanese youth are organized in the "Japan Youth Fatherland Front." The "Japan Youth Fatherland Front" calls on Japanese youth to actively oppose Japan's participation in the Korean War and oppose the revival of Japan's war industry.
    Natsume finally said: "Every day, when the Japanese people see the American flag flying over their heads, they feel the threat of a new war. The people of the world can believe that we are fighting against a new war and striving for world peace and friendship with all countries in the world. The Japanese people will always stand on the side of the peace camp."

　　日本人民反对美制对日和约草案
    战争工业中罢工增多农民反对军事基地化
    日本参加联欢节青年代表谈日本争取全面和约运动
    【新华社十九日讯】电通社柏林十七日讯：参加世界青年联欢节的日本代表夏目太郎向电通社记者谈称：“我们始终主张和平解决朝鲜战争。可是日本人民清楚知道美国仍然继续准备第三次世界大战，最好的证明就是美制对日和约草案和美国在开城谈判中所提出将分界线划在三八线以北若干公里的要求。”
    夏目太郎说：“日本人民反对美制对日和约草案，主要有三个原因：第一，我们反对美军留驻日本并把我们的国土变成军事侵略基地；第二，我们不愿在美国准备对亚洲其他国家人民进行的战争中去当炮灰；第三，如果美制和约签订了，日本和中苏两国间的战争状态仍然存在。”
    夏目太郎叙述了日本人民抵抗美国利用日本作为战争基地和兵工厂的情形。他说：战争工业中的工潮蔓延得很广，例如日本许多工厂中工人拒绝生产凝固汽油弹，飞机工厂制造了一批飞机用的汽油箱，结果全都不能使用。有一次美军在东京西郊一个树林里安设了高射炮，于是农民就把附近所有的树都锯光了。美国侵略朝鲜的战争给日本人民带来巨大灾害。自从朝鲜战争爆发以来，物价上涨了百分之六十。长期失业或短期失业的有三百万人。由于美国粮食倾销，农民大多数都破产了。尽管罢工是被禁止的，可是自今年年初以来，已有二百万人参加罢工。在这些罢工中，工会会员曾使得右倾的工会领袖们不得不支持罢工。
    夏目太郎说：日本青年正在积极参加日本人民争取全面和约、争取独立和民主的斗争。百分之三十的日本青年都组织在“日本青年祖国阵线”里面。“日本青年祖国阵线”号召日本青年积极反对日本参加朝鲜战争，并反对复活日本战争工业。
    夏目太郎最后说：“每天日本人民看见美国国旗飘扬在头上，就感觉到新战争的威胁。世界人民可以相信：我们正在进行反对新战争和争取世界和平、争取与全世界各国友好的斗争。日本人民永远站在和平阵营方面。”
