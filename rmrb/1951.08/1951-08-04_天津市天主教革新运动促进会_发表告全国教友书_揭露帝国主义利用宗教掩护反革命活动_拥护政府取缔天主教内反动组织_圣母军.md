Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin—The Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association, in support of the Tianjin Military Control Commission's correct measure to ban the secret Catholic reactionary organization "Legion of Mary," issued a letter to all Catholics on July 28th. The letter stated:

　　The international anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-people fascist secret reactionary organization "Legion of Mary," which uses our Catholicism as a cover, has been exposed for its crimes and has irrefutable evidence against it. Under the unanimous demand of the broad masses of people and patriotic Catholics, the Tianjin Military Control Commission issued a proclamation on July 13th, explicitly banning it. This measure by the government is to protect the fruits of the people's victory and freedom of religious belief, that is, to thoroughly implement the policies stipulated in Articles 5 and 7 of the Common Program, which is completely in line with the interests of the masses of the people and patriotic Catholics. Therefore, after the government's proclamation was issued, people from all walks of life in Tianjin expressed their heartfelt support. Many Catholics who had joined the "Legion of Mary" in the past but have now awakened have abided by the government's decree, registered and confessed to the government, and expressed their determination to break with this reactionary organization.

　　Catholics across the country! This is welcome news because it is yet another exposure of the conspiratorial activities of imperialist elements within our Catholicism, and the cracking down of an imperialist counter-revolutionary organization on the liberated homeland. From all its activities, we can clearly see that the "Legion of Mary" is by no means a religious organization, but an organ that uses religion as a cover to engage in intelligence gathering, spreading rumors, disseminating reactionary ideas, and carrying out counter-revolutionary activities.

　　In recent days, Catholics in Tianjin have held accusation meetings, exposing many of the evil deeds of the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary," which has made us increasingly aware of the extent to which the poisonous influence spread by imperialist elements within our Catholicism has reached!

　　From this, we should realize that the reason why imperialists can use our religion to carry out reactionary activities is precisely because our doctrines have long been distorted and our churches have long been controlled by them. Therefore, in order to defend our motherland and our religion, we must intensify our efforts and further develop our reform movement to thoroughly eliminate all imperialist elements and imperialist influences from our churches. It is hoped that Catholics across the country will thoroughly recognize that imperialist elements are not only enemies of the Chinese people but also enemies of Catholicism, thereby raising awareness, extensively launching exposure and accusations against the evil activities carried out by the "Legion of Mary" in various places, punishing imperialist elements such as Libeili and Mockqin according to law, and eradicating their reactionary organizations "Legion of Mary" and "National Catholic Welfare Conference" from Chinese soil. Because only in this way can we protect the fruits of the Chinese people's victory, restore the original face of our sacred religion, and unite with all patriotic non-Catholic people to work hard for the construction of a new China.

　　天津市天主教革新运动促进会
    发表告全国教友书
    揭露帝国主义利用宗教掩护反革命活动
    拥护政府取缔天主教内反动组织“圣母军”
    【新华社天津讯】天津市天主教革新运动促进会为拥护天津市军事管制委员会取缔天主教内秘密反动组织“圣母军”的正确措施，于七月二十八日发表告全国教友书。该书称：
    以我们天主教作掩护的国际反苏、反共、反人民的法西斯秘密反动组织“圣母军”，因罪行暴露，罪证确凿，在广大人民与爱国教友的一致要求下，天津市军事管制委员会已在七月十三日发出布告，明令予以取缔了。政府这一措施是为了保护人民胜利果实和宗教信仰自由，也就是彻底执行了共同纲领第五条和第七条规定的政策，是完全符合人民大众与爱国教徒的利益的。所以在政府的布告发表之后，天津市各界人民都纷纷表示衷心的拥护。许多过去加入过“圣母军”现已觉悟了的教友，都遵守政府的法令，向政府登记坦白，表示了与这个反动组织一刀两断的决心。
    全国各地的教友们！这是个可喜的消息，因为这是又一次地在我们天主教内揭露了帝国主义分子的阴谋活动，在已解放的祖国国土上破获了一个帝国主义者的反革命组织。从它的一切活动上，我们可以清楚地看出：“圣母军”丝毫不是什么宗教组织，却是以宗教为掩护进行刺探情报、散布谣言、宣传反动思想、进行反革命活动的机关。
    这几天来，天津市的教友们纷纷开控诉会，揭露了反动组织“圣母军”的许多罪恶事实，使我们愈益认清了帝国主义分子的阴谋诡计。但也正是从教友们的控诉与揭发当中，我们发现了帝国主义者在我们天主教内所散布的毒害影响是严重到如何程度！
    从这里，我们应该认识到：帝国主义者所以能利用我们的宗教来进行反动活动，正是因为我们的教义已久被歪曲，我们的教会也久被他们把持。所以为了保卫我们的祖国，保卫我们的宗教，我们必须加紧努力，更进一步地开展我们的革新运动，把一切帝国主义分子和帝国主义的影响从我们教会里彻底肃清出去。希望全国各地的教友们彻底认清帝国主义分子不但是中国人民的敌人、也是天主教的敌人，从而提高觉悟，广泛展开揭露、控诉“圣母军”在各地所进行的罪恶活动，把帝国主义分子黎培里、莫克勤之流依法惩办，将他们在中国土地上所布置的反动组织“圣母军”、“天主教教务协进委员会”连根拔除。因为，只有这样，我们才能保卫中国人民的胜利果实，才能恢复我们圣洁的宗教的本来面目，才能与一切爱国教外人士团结起来，为新中国的建设而努力。
