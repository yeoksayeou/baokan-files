　　"March of the Couple" is a Bad Movie
       Zhong Dianfei
    The newly released "March of the Couple" (screenplay by Tian Lu, directed by Hong Mo) from Yangtze Film Company, and "Between Us Husband and Wife" produced by Kunlun Film Company, can be said to be twins. One writes about a couple before the revolution, and the other writes about a couple after the revolution. Recently, there has been a growing number of film works focusing solely on the entanglements between couples, which is a noteworthy phenomenon. Works like "Between Us Husband and Wife" and "March of the Couple" cause the tense and complex revolutionary struggle, and the grand and large-scale national construction, to fade away into trivial matters between couples in artistic reflection; the so-called march of the couple here drowns out the voice of the era; the thoughts and feelings of petty-bourgeois intellectuals occupy most of the shots. The activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers are only arbitrarily manipulated when the authors need them. They seem to be telling the audience: "Don't you want a revolution? Then do it this way! It's both funny and fashionable. As for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, they are of course the 'masters'! They will sincerely serve you once you have made the revolution. These 'masters' lack culture and don't understand technology, so all they can do is serve you."
    This film awkwardly constructs the main theme of this "march" by using Chen Qiyuan, a clerk who served in a foreign firm in Shanghai before liberation, and Ge Lina, a wealthy lady who does not lift a finger, relying on others to provide for her. Chen Qiyuan even greatly regretted the closure of his foreign firm when it was first liberated, but not long after, he was humbly invited by the union chairman of a certain state-owned machinery factory. The military representative of the factory also treated him with great courtesy. Sure enough, this "engineer," who had never had any practical experience, quickly created a miracle and became a "meritorious person"; and this wealthy lady? Before and after liberation, she kept clamoring to go to Hong Kong. After her husband joined the state-owned machinery factory, she even partnered with others to engage in private gold speculation, and even said, "Life forces me to do this!" The author even wants to make her cry bitterly, in an attempt to make the audience sympathize with her criminal behavior! Later, this illegal business was uncovered, and the principal offender was arrested. As for her? According to the film's explanation, she only felt "ashamed and guilty, with nowhere to hide," and did not receive any punishment or blame! Moreover, because this Mrs. Ge Lina has "culture," the Sister Gu who works in the Women's Federation spared no effort to repeatedly beg her to help women learn to read with a "leisurely attitude." Only then did she reluctantly agree. So the women sat there dumbly listening to her teachings! Later, when her husband became a "meritorious person," she also became an "activist"! It is not difficult to see how deep the sympathy our literary friends from petty-bourgeois backgrounds have for the people they are familiar with and closely related to! Moreover, they used the Midas touch of literature and art to make these originally pampered and prominent figures, after a major revolution, remain prominent figures without much transformation, but no longer called masters and mistresses, but "meritorious persons" and "activists."
    In order to make this "march" not monotonous and dull, the author also invited several people to accompany it, and painted grotesque faces on these accompanying people. The first person to be painted with a grotesque face is Li Zhigang, a "union chairman." After the liberation of Shanghai, the first thing this Li Zhigang cared about was the life of the wealthy lady, worried that her lifestyle would be affected, so he enthusiastically bought her vegetables and slaughtered chickens, being considerate and meticulous. When he was suddenly introduced as the "union chairman" of a certain state-owned machinery factory, he was never seen carrying out any work among the workers. It seemed that his job was to deal with the engineer! Judging from his expression and behavior, he looked like a petty gangster, with no trace of a worker. The second person to be painted with a grotesque face is the military representative, who is depicted as a careless person who only follows the engineer's lead in everything! Later, it was said that a celebration meeting was to be held, and the program also included speeches by labor heroes of the factory, but through the film's clever editing, the labor hero only gave the audience a front view and a back view. All of this clearly tells us that the union chairman, the military representative, and the workers are just discordant notes in this "march," and the tune is very low, some even without a reed, unable to make any sound! Is this also called the literary and artistic direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers? It should be said accurately that here the workers, peasants, and soldiers are only foils, only stiffly embellished to cover up the shame.
    What is even more distressing is not only this. The author allowed Ge Lina to viciously mock the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. Such blatant and numerous defamatory words appeared openly in the film without receiving due rebuttal and punishment.
    The film also intentionally distorts and exaggerates the supply system and salary system of government agencies. Originally, the salary system had long been widely implemented in our state-owned enterprises, especially for workers and technicians. However, the author insists that this engineer enjoys the supply system. His wife's involvement in speculative business is "forced by life." Later, it was because Chen Qiyuan made meritorious service that the military representative graciously changed him to a salary system. When this engineer received his salary for the first time, he was truly moved! Don't all these descriptions reflect the author's confusion and surprisingly low political thought? Aren't these literary and art workers, who are waving the banner of revolutionary literature and art but actually promoting bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, actually hindering the transformation and political improvement of the petty-bourgeoisie? Aren't they intentionally spreading prejudice and short-sightedness among them!
    "March of the Couple" is a thoroughly bad film, and the author's inferiority in political and artistic thought is unimaginable!

### 《夫妇进行曲》是一部坏电影

　　《夫妇进行曲》是一部坏电影
       钟惦棐
    长江影业公司新出的《夫妇进行曲》（田鲁编剧、洪谟导演），和昆仑影业公司出品的《我们夫妇之间》可以说是一对孪生子。一个写了一对革命前的夫妇，一个写了一对革命后的夫妇。近来，在电影方面，单纯以夫妇之间的纠葛为题材的作品渐渐增多起来，这是很值得注意的现象。象《我们夫妇之间》、《夫妇进行曲》这样的作品，使紧张复杂的革命斗争，与轰轰烈烈、巨大规模的国家建设，在艺术反映中，都黯然消失在夫妇之间的琐事里面；所谓夫妇进行曲在这里淹没了时代的声音；小资产阶级知识分子的思想感情在这里占据了大部分的镜头。工农兵的活动，都只在作者们所需要的时候才被随意加以摆布。他们仿佛是这样告诉观众：“你们不是要革命么？就照这样革吧！既风趣，又时髦。至于工农兵，那当然是“主人翁”呵！他们在等你一旦革命之后，便将诚心诚意来侍候你。这辈“主人翁”既缺少文化，又不懂得技术，他们所能做的，便是来侍候你。”
    这影片借一个解放前在上海洋行里服务的职员陈启元，和一个饭来张口，衣来伸手的阔太太葛丽娜，来生硬地构成了这个“进行曲”的主调。陈启元在刚解放时还对他的洋行关门大为惋惜，但是过不多久，他被某公营机器厂的工会主任低三下四地请去了。该厂的军代表亦对他恩礼有加。果然，这位从来没有什么实际经验的“工程师”很快便创造了奇迹，居然成了“功臣”；而这位阔太太呢？解放前后都一直嚷着要去香港，在丈夫参加公营机器厂工作后，她还与别人合伙干着私营金钞的买卖，而且还说什么“生活逼得没有法子呀！”甚至作者还要叫她痛哭流涕，来企图叫观众同情她这种罪恶行为！后来这非法买卖被破获了，主犯被捕。她呢？按照电影说明书对她的解释，只是“羞惭内疚，无地自容”，而没有得到任何惩罚或责备！而且还由于这位葛丽娜太太有“文化”，使得那位在妇联工作的顾大姐不惜再三央告她，要她以“消遣的心情”来帮助妇女识字。这才好容易得到她的同意。于是妇女们便呆头呆脑的坐在那里听取她的教诲！后来在丈夫当了“功臣”的时候，她竟也成了“积极分子”！不难看出，我们这些出身于小资产阶级的文艺朋友们，对于他们所熟悉而且休戚相关的人，是具有多么深刻的同情呵！而且他们使用了文艺的点金术，使这些原本就是养尊处优、出人头地的人物，在经过一场大革命之后，可以不经过什么改造，便仍然成为面子人物，不过不再叫老爷太太，而改叫“功臣”和“积极分子”了。
    作者为了使这个“进行曲”不单调、沉闷，还请了几个人作伴奏，而且都给这些伴奏的人画上鬼脸。第一个被画上鬼脸的是一个叫做“工会主任”的李志刚，这位李志刚，在上海解放后，他第一着关心的是阔太太的生活，耽心她的生活方式受了影响，于是他热心地给她买菜杀鸡，体贴入微。当他忽然被介绍说是某公营机器厂的“工会主任”之后，压根儿也没有看见过他在工人中进行过什么工作，好象他的职务便是和工程师周旋！从他那副神情及举止看来，活象一个小流氓，丝毫没有工人的气味。第二个被画上鬼脸的是军事代表，把这位军代表描写成为一个少心没肺的人，事事只会跟着工程师的屁股转！后来说是要开庆功大会了，节目中也有工厂劳动英雄的讲话，但是通过电影巧妙的剪接，这位劳动英雄所给与观众的只是一个正面，一个背影。所有这些都明白地告诉我们：工会主任也好，军事代表也好，工人也好，在这个“进行曲”中只是一些不协合音，而且调子很低沉，有的竟至没有簧，什么声音也发不出！难道这也叫做工农兵的文艺方向？应该确切地说，在这里工农兵只是陪衬，只是为了遮羞才被生硬的点缀进去的。
    令人痛心的还不止此。作者让葛丽娜恶毒地嘲骂了共产党和人民解放军，如此露骨而又如此众多的诽谤词句，在影片中公然出现，而没有受到应有的反驳和惩罚。
    关于人民政府机关的供给制和薪金制待遇，在这个影片中，也有意地把它歪曲渲染一番。本来，在我们的公营企业部门，很早就普遍地实行了薪金制待遇，尤其是在工人和技术人员方面。然而作者硬要说这位工程师所享受的是供给制待遇。他的老婆去干投机买卖，乃是“生活所迫”。后来是因为陈启元立了功，军事代表才又恩赐似地给他改作薪金制。当这位工程师第一次领到薪金时，他才真正被感动了！所有这些描写，难道不正是反映了作者政治思想的混乱与惊人的低下么？这些打着革命文艺的旗帜而实际上宣传资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的文艺工作者，难道不正是实际上阻碍着小资产阶级的改造和政治上的提高？难道不正是有意地在他们中间散布偏见与短视么！
    《夫妇进行曲》是一部十足的坏影片，作者在政治思想和艺术思想上的低劣是叫人难以想象的！
