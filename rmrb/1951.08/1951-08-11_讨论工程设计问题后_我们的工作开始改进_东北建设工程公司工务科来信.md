    Our Work Begins to Improve After Discussing Engineering Design Problems
    -- Letter from the Engineering Department of the Northeast Construction Engineering Company

    To the Editor:

    We recently studied and discussed engineering design problems and made a summary. This study has improved our understanding, and our work has begun to improve. In the study, we examined what constitutes correct engineering design. To illustrate the importance of each design step, we cited several examples of losses incurred due to a lack of design and studied them, from which many problems can be seen. Some projects were blindly constructed without "task design." For example, the Science Research Institute's construction of a building in Shenyang in 1950 was halted midway due to changes in the task, wasting resources worth over 90 million RMB (old currency). Another example is the Electric Power Bureau's construction of a central laboratory in 1950, which was halted midway due to insufficient funding, resulting in a loss of over 114.38 million RMB (old currency). Some projects suffered significant losses due to blind construction without "basic construction design." For example, when the Mudanjiang Water Plant built a water pool in 1950, the capacity of the water pump was not well-coordinated with the water demand, resulting in repeated modifications and a waste of over 320 million Northeast currency, equivalent to over 33.6 million RMB (old currency). Others were blindly constructed without "technical design," resulting in significant losses. For example, the No. 4 Factory of the Electrical Engineering Bureau originally planned to build a factory in Suihua, but did not conduct geological exploration or consider the earthquake situation in Suihua, resulting in a mid-project relocation to Harbin. Preliminary estimates indicate a loss of over 2 billion RMB (old currency). There were also instances of blind construction without "construction design." This occurred when our company (Construction Engineering Company of the Northeast Industrial Department) undertook the construction of the 工学院 (Engineering Institute) project in 1950. Without proper construction design, materials were randomly placed, earthwork was randomly piled, and the position of the mixer was not reserved, resulting in a waste of 140 million Northeast currency, equivalent to 14.7 million RMB (old currency). These kinds of examples are countless in our current basic construction work. However, even from these few examples, the importance of each design step can be seen.

    Our company is a construction unit, and our Engineering Department is the executive agency for construction, with the responsibility of immediately implementing construction design. Therefore, after the entire department studied the People's Daily editorial, we immediately adopted the following measures: First, each construction site must draw a factory layout diagram, indicating the location of material and earthwork storage, reserved traffic areas, mechanical installation locations, work areas, and construction areas for worker sheds. Second, each construction site must draw steel and timber cutting diagrams to ensure that long and short materials can be used in combination. Third, formulate a project schedule, material supply schedule, tool supply schedule, labor supply schedule, and inspection record form, and distribute them to each construction site. As a result of implementing various schedules, the phenomena of work stoppage due to waiting for materials, waiting for labor, and waiting for tools have been greatly reduced. As a result of implementing factory layout diagrams, the phenomena of digging traffic routes after piling earthwork and relocating materials after piling them have been fundamentally eliminated. As a result of implementing material matching diagrams, the steel cutting work of the First Engineering Team saved three tons of steel, equivalent to 11 million RMB (old currency); the human-character timber cutting work of the Third Engineering Team saved twenty cubic meters of timber, equivalent to 1.2 million RMB (old currency).

    Our gains are very small. But it can be said with certainty that these gains are the result of our study. Therefore, we suggest that all basic construction units study the People's Daily editorial and reports on the impossibility of construction without proper engineering design and enthusiastically participate in discussions on this issue.

### 讨论工程设计问题后  我们的工作开始改进——东北建设工程公司工务科来信

    讨论工程设计问题后  我们的工作开始改进
    ——东北建设工程公司工务科来信编辑同志：
    我们最近学习和讨论了工程设计问题，并做了总结。这次学习使我们的认识提高了一步，我们的工作也开始在改进。在学习中，我们研究了什么是正确的工程设计。为了说明每个设计步骤的重要性，我们举出了几个未经设计而受到的损失的例证来研究，从中可以看出很多问题。有的工程是未经过“任务设计”而盲目施工的。例如科学研究所一九五○年在沈阳修建大楼因任务变更而中途停工，浪费的资财折合人民币九千余万元。又如电业局一九五○年修建中心试验所，修到半途因经费不足而停工，其损失折合人民币一亿一千四百三十八万余元。有的工程因未经过“基建设计”而盲目施工，损失很大。例如牡丹江自来水厂一九五○年修建水池时，未把送水机的能力与需水量很好配合，修好再改，改了又修，浪费了东北币三亿二千万元以上，折合人民币三千三百六十余万元。还有的是未经“技术设计”即盲目施工，结果也造成很大损失。例如电工局第四厂，原拟在绥化建筑厂房，但未经过钻探地质，也未考虑绥化地震情况，结果中途搬到哈尔滨。初步估计已损失人民币二十余亿元之多。还有未经“施工设计”而盲目施工的。这就是本公司（东北工业部建设工程公司）于一九五○年承建工学院工程时，未经过很好的施工设计，以致材料乱放，土方乱堆，搅拌机的位置也未留出，结果浪费了东北币一亿四千万元，折合人民币一千四百七十万元。这一类的例子，在我们目前的基本建设工作中，是不胜枚举的。但仅从这几个例子中，已可看出每个设计步骤的重要性了。
    我们公司是施工单位，我们工务科又是施工的执行机构，有将施工设计立刻付之实行的责任。所以在全科学习人民日报的社论后，我们就立即采取了如下几个措施：第一，各工地一定要绘制工场配置图，注明材料土方堆放位置，交通道预留地段，机械按装地点，工作场所及工棚建造区域。第二，各工地一定要绘制钢筋木材下料图表，以便长短料子能够配搭使用。第三，拟定工程进度表、材料供应进度表、工具供应进度表、人工供应进度表、检查纪录表，分发各工地使用。由于我们实行了各种进度表，停工待料、停工待工、停工待具的现象，大大地减少了。由于我们实行了工场配置图，土方堆好再来挖交通道和材料堆好再来搬家的现象，根本上消灭了。由于我们实行了材料锻配图表，第一工程队的钢筋下料工作，便节省了钢筋三吨，折合人民币一千一百万元；第三工程队的人字木下料工作中，便节省了木材二十立方公尺，折合人民币一百二十万元。
    我们的收获是很小的。但可以肯定地说，这收获是我们学习的结果。因此，我们建议各基本建设单位都学习人民日报关于没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工的社论和报道，并热烈参加关于这个问题的讨论。
