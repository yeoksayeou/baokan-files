Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, August 29th: This reporter has learned from authoritative sources that the US Air Force's raid into the Kaesong Neutral Zone airspace on the evening of August 22nd, bombing and strafing with the intention of murdering our side's armistice negotiation delegation, is the culmination of the US side's destruction of the agreement on the neutralization of the Kaesong area (including the partial agreement on the neutralization of the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone). In fact, prior to the August 22nd US Air Force bombing and murder incident, the US Air Force had consistently violated the agreement on the neutralization of the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone, constantly raiding the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone. Even after the August 22nd murder incident, US Air Force aircraft continued to raid the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone.

The issue of neutralizing the Kaesong area was originally agreed upon by both sides in mid-July: the armed forces of both sides shall not conduct hostile activities within the Kaesong Neutral Zone. The term "armed forces" in the agreement naturally includes the air force, and the so-called neutralization of the Kaesong area naturally includes the neutralization of the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone. However, after both sides established the agreement on the neutralization of the Kaesong area, the US Air Force aircraft never adhered to the spirit of this agreement, frequently intruding into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone, engaging in harassment and threats, and even circling at low altitude, creating a threat to the negotiation meeting. In view of the frequent occurrence of such intolerable acts of sabotage by the US side, on August 13th, our liaison officer formally proposed at the meeting of liaison officers of both sides that since both sides had agreed to delineate an area with a radius of five miles centered on Kaesong as a neutral zone, the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone should be included in the scope of neutralization, and the other side's aircraft should abide by the agreement and not intrude into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone. The liaison officer of the US "United Nations Command Delegation" did not deny the fact that US aircraft had constantly intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone, but most absurdly and shamelessly said that US aircraft were flying in the air more than five miles above Kaesong and could not be considered as infringing on the Kaesong Neutral Zone. However, after our side severely refuted this based on the agreement between the two sides on the neutralization of Kaesong, the other side had no excuse to respond, only saying that this matter could be considered. On August 14th, the US liaison officer formally stated at the meeting of liaison officers of both sides that they were willing to respect the neutrality of the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone and agreed that armed forces should not enter the neutral zone, including the air force. The other side's liaison officer also stated that the aircraft used by the delegation participating in the armistice conference were not among those prohibited from flying into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone; and claimed that in the event of uncontrollable circumstances, such as bad weather or low cloud cover, they could not guarantee that their aircraft would not fly into the Kaesong Neutral Zone. Our liaison officer did not agree to the other side's reservation regarding the situation where they could not control the air force. On August 15th, at the meeting of liaison officers of both sides, our side solemnly stated that when the two sides reached a principled agreement, the so-called technical difficulties should not be used as an excuse to refuse to implement the neutral zone agreement. The other side's liaison officer immediately clearly stated: "Our side does not attempt to have our aircraft fly into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone." On August 16th, the other side's liaison officer formally announced at the meeting of liaison officers of both sides that they agreed in principle to our side's proposal that the armed forces of both sides, including aircraft, should not enter the neutral zone and its airspace and should not attack the neutral zone. At this point, a specific agreement was reached between the two sides on the issue of the neutralization of the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone.

However, in reality, since the implementation of the neutralization of the Kaesong area, US Air Force aircraft have frequently intruded into the airspace over the neutral zone. There have been US aircraft intrusion incidents almost every day. At most, as many as 43 sorties of aircraft intruded in one day. After the special agreement on the neutralization of the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone was established on August 16th, the US side still betrayed the most basic faith of international negotiations. US military aircraft, as before, continued to illegally intrude into the airspace over the neutral zone unscrupulously. From August 17th to August 22nd, the US Air Force's intrusion situation was as follows:

August 17th, at 15:13, two US aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong from the north for harassment and then flew south.

August 19th, in the morning, four US aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong for harassment and then flew south. On the same day, at 14:20, another two enemy aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong from the north for harassment and then flew south.

August 22nd, at 10:20, one US aircraft intruded and passed over the negotiation venue at an altitude of about 500 meters for harassment and then flew south. On the same day, at 22:20, one US aircraft intruded into the airspace over the neutral zone and bombed and strafed the residence of our negotiation delegation, attempting to murder our negotiation delegation. At this point, the US side's despicable criminal act of betraying the agreement and faith reached its culmination.

After the incident on August 22nd in which the US bombed and strafed the residence of our delegation with aircraft, and after our delegation lodged a serious protest, the US side not only completely denied their barbaric murder crime, but also US Air Force aircraft continued to frequently violate the Kaesong Neutral Zone as before. From August 23rd to August 26th, the US Air Force aircraft intrusion situation was as follows:

August 24th, at 21:00, one US aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong from the east for harassment and then flew northwest.

August 25th, at 22:00, one US aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong from the east for harassment and then flew north.

August 26th, at 11:00, two US aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong from the northeast for harassment and then flew southeast.

### 背弃国际信义破坏开城中立区协议  美机一贯侵犯中立区上空  美空军轰炸谋杀事件是破坏双方协议登峰造极的发展

　　背弃国际信义破坏开城中立区协议
    美机一贯侵犯中立区上空
    美空军轰炸谋杀事件是破坏双方协议登峰造极的发展
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】本社记者自权威方面获悉：八月二十二日晚间美国空军袭入开城中立区上空实行轰炸扫射图谋杀害我方停战谈判代表团的事件，乃是美国方面破坏双方关于开城中立化协议（包括开城中立区上空中立化的部分协议在内）的登峰造极的发展。因为事实上，在二十二日美国空军轰炸谋杀事件以前，美国空军即一贯破坏开城中立地区上空中立化的协议，不断袭入开城中立区上空；即在二十二日谋杀事件以后，美国空军飞机仍然不断袭入开城中立区上空。
    开城地区中立化问题，原由双方于七月中旬协议：双方武装部队在开城中立区内不得进行敌对活动。协议中所谓武装部队，当然包括空军在内；所谓开城地区中立化当然包括开城中立区上空中立化在内。但在双方成立开城地区中立化协议以后，美方空军飞机始终未曾遵守这一协议的精神，经常侵入开城中立区上空，实行骚扰威胁，甚至低空盘旋，造成一种对谈判会议的威胁。鉴于美方这种不可容忍的破坏协议的行为频频发生，八月十三日我方联络官乃在双方联络官会议上正式提出，双方既已同意划定以开城为中心圆半径为五英里的地区为中立区，开城中立区上空自应包括在中立化范围之内，对方飞机自应遵守协议，不得侵入开城中立区上空。美方“联合国军代表团”的联络官并没有否认美方飞机不断侵入开城中立区上空的事实，却最荒谬最无耻地说，美方飞机系在开城上空五英里以上的空中飞行，不能谓为侵犯开城中立区。但经我方根据双方关于开城中立化协议予以严重驳斥后，对方即无辞以对，仅称，关于此事可以考虑。八月十四日美方联络官在双方联络官会议上正式表示愿尊重开城中立区上空的中立，同意武装部队不进入中立区，包括空军在内。对方联络官同时声明，对方参加休战会议的代表团所用的飞机不在不得飞入开城中立区上空之列；并声称遇有不能控制的情况，例如气候不佳，云层过低等时，不能保证他们的飞机不飞入开城中立区。我方联络官对于对方所提的不能控制空军的情况的保留未予同意。八月十五日在双方联络官会议上我方并严正提出，在双方作成原则性协议时，不应以所谓技术上的困难为借口，拒绝执行中立区协议。对方联络官当即明白表示：“我方并不企图将我方飞机飞入开城中立区上空。”八月十六日，对方联络官在双方联络官会议上对我方所提双方武装部队，包括飞机在内，不得进入中立区及其上空并不得向中立区攻击一节正式宣布原则上同意。至此，关于开城中立区上空的中立化问题，双方乃达成具体协议。
    但在实际上，自开城地区实行中立化以来，美国空军飞机经常侵入中立区上空，几乎每一天都有美国飞机入侵事件，最多时一日之内入侵飞机竟多至四十三架次。八月十六日双方就开城中立区上空中立化问题成立特别协议以后，美国方面仍然背弃国际谈判的最起码信义，美军飞机和从前一样肆无忌惮地不断非法侵入中立区上空。自八月十七日至八月二十二日，美国空军入侵的情况如下：
    八月十七日十五时十三分，美国飞机两架由北面侵入开城上空骚扰后向南飞去。
    八月十九日上午美国飞机四架侵入开城上空骚扰后向南飞去。同日十四时二十分又有敌机两架由北面侵入开城上空骚扰后向南飞去。
    八月二十二日十时二十分美国飞机一架入侵，在约五百公尺低空经过谈判会场上空骚扰后向南飞去。同日二十二时二十分美国飞机一架侵入中立区上空向我方谈判代表团住所投弹射击，图谋杀害我方谈判代表团。至此，美国方面背弃协议信义的卑鄙犯罪行为，便达到了登峰造极的程度。
    八月二十二日美国以飞机轰炸扫射我方代表团住所的事件发生，并经我方代表团提出严重抗议后，美方不但完全抵赖他们的野蛮谋杀罪行，而且美国空军飞机继续照以前一样频繁地侵犯开城中立区。从八月二十三日起至八月二十六日止，美国空军飞机入侵的情况如下：
    八月二十四日二十一时美国飞机一架由东面侵入开城上空骚扰后向西北飞去。
    八月二十五日二十二时美国飞机一架由东面侵入开城上空骚扰后向北飞去。
    八月二十六日十一时美国飞机两架由东北方向侵入开城上空骚扰后向东南飞去。
