　　US Delays Korean Armistice Talks
    on Pretext of Isolated Incident
    Yesterday's Meeting Failed to Take Place as Scheduled
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th] This correspondent learned from the headquarters on the Korean front: The United Nations Command delegation did not come to Kaesong on August 5th, and the 20th meeting of the Korean armistice talks therefore failed to take place as scheduled.

    Before the end of the 19th meeting on the afternoon of August 4th, the chief representative of the United Nations Command delegation pointed out that a number of our armed guards had crossed the meeting area at 12:45, some hundreds of yards from the United Nations Command delegation's dormitory, and brought it to our attention. We immediately conducted an inspection, and notified the other party of the inspection results through the liaison officer on the morning of August 5th as follows:

    "Yesterday at 13:00, the guard unit responsible for guarding the Kaesong area gathered at the Koryo-dong Square, 1,000 meters from the meeting place, to discuss how to maintain order in the Kaesong area. Some guards accidentally entered the meeting area on their way to the meeting. The chief representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation have once again ordered the responsible personnel of the Kaesong neutral area guard unit to pay close attention to the regulations that armed personnel and troops must not enter the meeting area, and ordered me to notify you that this order will be guaranteed to be strictly enforced so that such incidents do not happen again." After the chief representative of the United Nations Command delegation brought this incident to our attention yesterday, he clearly suggested that the meeting should continue at 10:00 am on August 5th. However, on August 5th, the other party used this isolated incident as an excuse not to come to Kaesong, causing the armistice talks to be postponed again and failing to take place as scheduled.

　　美方借口偶发事件
    拖延朝鲜停战谈判
    昨日会议未能按期举行
    【新华社平壤五日电】本社记者自朝鲜前线总部获悉：八月五日联合国军代表团未来开城，朝鲜停战谈判会议第二十次会议因此未能按期举行。
    八月四日下午第十九次会议结束以前，联合国军代表团首席代表提出我方武装警卫人员若干人曾于十二时四十五分穿过会址区域，距离联合国军代表团宿舍数百码处地区，提请我方注意。我方立即进行了检查，并将检查结果通过联络官在八月五日清晨通知对方如下：
    “昨日十三时负责警卫开城地区的警卫部队在距会场一千公尺之高丽洞广场集合开会，讨论如何维护开城地区的秩序，一部分警卫人员在赴会途中误入会址地区。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表，已再度通令开城中立地区警卫部队的负责人员，切实注意武装人员、部队不得进入会场地区的规定，并命令我通知贵方这项命令将被保证严格执行，以使这类事件不再发生。”联合国军代表团首席代表昨日就此项事件提请我方注意后，曾明白建议：会议在八月五日上午十时继续举行。但八月五日对方竟借口这一偶发事件不来开城，以致使停战谈判会议再度延期，不能按期举行。
