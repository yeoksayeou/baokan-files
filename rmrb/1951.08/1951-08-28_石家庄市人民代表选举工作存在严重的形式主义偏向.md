　　Serious Formalism Bias Exists in the People's Representative Election Work in Shijiazhuang City

　　Shijiazhuang City has already convened two sessions of the People's Congress. The first session held five meetings, and the second session has already held two. The city is now preparing to extend the work of the People's Congress to districts and rural areas in the suburbs.

　　The city has basically adopted a universal suffrage system for election issues: dividing electoral districts, universally registering and grouping voters for review, posting public notices of citizens, candidates campaigning, the number of candidates exceeding the number of those to be elected by a factor of one, implementing preliminary elections, and then conducting anonymous voting elections.

　　The Civil Affairs Department of the city's People's Government believes that "the people feel this is good, and democracy doesn't mind being troublesome." However, on-the-spot investigations have yielded the completely opposite result. Facts have proven that serious shortcomings of bourgeois "formal" democracy exist in the city's election issues. Deputy Mayor Zang of the city also believes that "the shortcoming is formalism." For example: According to the reflections of staff members of the Second District Government, two representatives, and six voters, only one person said "Universal suffrage is good, voting is serious, and it is democratic," while the other eight people said: "It is time-consuming, laborious, delays production, and delays business." They believe that based on the actual situation, it is better to elect by sector and industry, as this would provide broader representation and the election method would be simpler, just raise your hand (it is very difficult for illiterate people to vote). The first session of representatives in the city took more than forty days, with large and small meetings all day long, and it took dozens of days just to review the representatives, delaying everyone's production. When it came to the second election of representatives, the masses were afraid of being as troublesome as the first session, and some came to the district to ask: "Will it be the same as before? It takes too long and really delays things!" However, some comrades in the city still insist on not "going backwards," believing that not having universal suffrage is "narrowing the scope of democracy and reducing the people's democratic rights." This incorrect thinking should be corrected.

　　石家庄市人民代表选举工作存在严重的形式主义偏向
    石家庄市现已召开过二届人民代表大会，第一届共开过五次会，第二届已开过二次会。现正准备将人民代表大会工作向区和郊区农村推广中。
    该市对于选举问题基本上采取了普选制度：划分选区，普遍登记与分组审查选民，贴公民榜，候选人竞选，候选人数要超过当选人数一倍，实行预选之后，再无记名投票选举。
    该市人民政府民政部门认为“人民感觉这样好，民主不嫌麻烦”。但实地考查，结果完全相反。事实证明，该市在选举问题上存在着严重的资产阶级“形式”民主的缺点。该市臧副市长也认为“缺点是形式主义”。例如：根据该市第二区区政府工作人员、二位代表、六位选民的反映，其中只有一人说“普选好，投票认真，民主”，其余八个人都说：“费时、费事，耽误生产，耽误买卖”。他们认为根据实际情况，还是分界、分行业选举好，这样代表性广泛，选举方法亦比较简便，举手就行（不识字的人投票很困难）。该市第一届代表选了四十多天，整天大会小会，只审查代表就用了几十天工夫，耽误大家的生产。到第二届代表选举时，群众又怕象一届那样麻烦，有到区里来问的：“还那样选吗？时间拖得太长了，真耽误事！”然而该市有些同志仍然坚持不“走回头路”，认为不普选就是“缩小民主范围，降低人民民主权利”。这种不正确的思想是应该纠正的。
