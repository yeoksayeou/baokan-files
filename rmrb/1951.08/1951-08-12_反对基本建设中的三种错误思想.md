　　Oppose Three Erroneous Ideas in Basic Construction
　　Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Wang Guojun
　　Recently, the People's Daily has continuously published many articles on basic construction. These articles clarify the principle that "construction is impossible without correct engineering design" and also raise some ideological issues in basic construction, which are worth learning.
　　In addition to agreeing with these opinions, I would also like to raise three ideological issues. These three ideological issues are deeply influenced by the toxic ideas of capitalist economic construction and must be eliminated.
　　(1) Completely discard the old and adopt a new set of things. Many factories want to make themselves impressive and modernize all their equipment. They abandon the old construction and start a new set of things. This seems right at first glance, but it ignores the laws of objective development. Because modernization cannot be achieved in one leap, we still lack human and material resources, and funds need to be accumulated. To completely discard the old would reduce a lot of productivity. However, the new cannot be established immediately. Therefore, we must, on the one hand, sort out the old and maximize its effectiveness, and on the other hand, build new ones and develop production. However, some people do not use a pragmatic attitude, but apply the capitalist economic construction idea of "survival of the fittest" to our construction, trying to innovate and engage in fantasies of free competition. For example, some factories insist that the old factory buildings cannot be used, and that their work efficiency cannot be brought into play without building new factories. Is this completely correct? The Soviet Union already has modern 200-ton open-hearth furnaces, but it has not completely dismantled the old 30-ton open-hearth furnaces. Our economy is still very difficult, and we must be careful in our calculations. Of course, we cannot completely destroy the old and start a new set of things.
　　(2) Make things as big as possible for future development. Some factories only believe that China's industry will definitely develop in the future, so they build the factory buildings as large as possible, resulting in empty spaces inside and turning the state's investment into stagnant funds. This is a capitalist construction method, which always hopes that its own factory will be large and overwhelm other small factories. However, Soviet experts repeatedly told us that the design should be pragmatic. If a three-ton crane is enough, do not install a five-ton crane. The factory building should meet the current needs, and future development can be discussed later. First, make a complete plan, and then develop it step by step. The plans and reports also pay special attention to the effectiveness of the investment. We must use every penny of investment to its full potential.
　　(3) One enterprise always wants to monopolize the relevant industries. An iron and steel plant already encompasses a wide range of industries, including refractory materials and coal tar by-products. Some factories also want to solve machine manufacturing themselves. They want to handle all related industries themselves. They always think that others are unreliable and will affect their own development. This not only leads to insufficient manpower and financial resources, but also to a huge basic construction investment being scattered across various departments, resulting in delays in everything.
　　These three ideas are all influenced by the toxic ideas of capitalist economic construction and should be eliminated. We must learn more from the Soviet Union's experience in basic construction and see how the Soviet Union's economic construction is steadily advancing. We are taking the socialist road, not the capitalist road. We must eliminate these unplanned and anarchic capitalist ideas.

### 反对基本建设中的三种错误思想

　　反对基本建设中的三种错误思想
    太原钢铁厂  王国钧
    最近人民日报连续发表了很多关于基本建设的文章。阐明了“没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工”的道理，更提出了一些基本建设方面的思想问题，是值得我们学习的。
    我除了赞同这些意见而外，还愿意提出三个思想问题。这三个思想问题，是受着很深的资本主义经济建设的思想毒素影响，也是必需肃清的。
    （一）旧的完全不要，重新来套新的。很多工厂都想把自己搞得有声有色，一切设备近代化。把旧的建设废弃，重新来一套新的。这乍看起来似乎是对的，但是忽视了客观发展的规律。因为要近代化，不是一跳就可以到的，我们现在人力物力都还缺乏，资金还得积累。要把旧的完全不要，就会减少很多生产力。然而新的不是立刻可以起来的。所以我们必须一面将旧的加以整理，尽量发挥它的效用，一面再建设新的，发展生产。可是有些人不是用实事求是的态度，而是把资本主义经济建设的一套“优胜劣败”的思想用到我们的建设上来了，尽量标新立异地去作自由竞争的幻想。譬如有些厂硬说旧的厂房不能使用，非建立新厂不能发挥它的工作效率，这是完全正确吗？苏联已经有了近代化的二百吨平炉，可是并没有把古旧的三十吨平炉完全拆去。我们的经济还很困难，我们还要精打细算，当然不能完全摧毁旧的而重来一套新的。
    （二）尽量做大些，以后好发展。有些工厂只认定中国工业以后是一定要发展的，于是把厂房尽量修得大，结果里面空空洞洞，把国家的投资，弄成呆滞的资金。这是资本主义的建设方法，总希望自己的厂大，把其他的小厂压倒。而苏联专家再三告诉我们，设计要实事求是，三吨吊车可以够的，就不要装五吨吊车。厂房要切合目前需要，以后发展以后再说。先做出整套计划，然后逐步发展。计划表报上也特别注意投资的实效部分。我们有一分钱投资，就要顶一分钱使用。
    （三）一个企业总想把有关工业独揽。一个钢铁厂有耐火材料、焦油副产等等的配合工业，已经包罗万象。还有些厂要想把机器制造也自己解决。一切有关工业都想自己来办。总想着别人靠不住，会影响自己的发展。这不仅弄得人力不够，财力也不够，一笔巨大的基本建设投资，分散在各部门，结果事情都耽误了。
    这三种思想，都是受了资本主义经济建设的思想毒素影响，应该肃清。我们要多多学习苏联基本建设的经验，看看苏联的经济建设是怎样稳步前进的。我们走的是社会主义的道路，而不是资本主义的道路。我们必须肃清这些无计划无政府的资本主义的思想。
