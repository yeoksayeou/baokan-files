　　French Government Crisis Continues for a Long Time
    The French Reactionary Camp is Even More Chaotic
    Still Unable to Form a Government Seven Weeks After the Election
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch] Paris News: Nearly seven weeks after the French election, the French reactionaries are still unable to form a government, which shows that the entire French reactionary camp is more chaotic and weak than before the election.
    Since Renault, the infamous French surrender premier during World War II, gave up his fruitless attempt to form a cabinet on July 26, French President Auriol had to ask the current Minister of Finance and President of Lazard Bank, Bisch, who had already failed to form a cabinet once, to try again on the 27th. After being ordered, Bisch originally planned to hold two meetings: one was a meeting of previous prime ministers since 1947, and the other was a meeting of leaders of various right-wing majority parties, in an attempt to reconcile the contradictions within the various right-wing parties in the face of the powerful resistance of the people. However, according to the United Press, Bisch only勉强 convened the first meeting, and the second meeting ended in failure because it was "impossible to get the parties together to formulate a government program." Finally, after seven days of behind-the-scenes "negotiations" between Bisch and the various political parties of the right-wing majority, he was still rejected when he asked the National Assembly to approve his cabinet formation on August 2.
    Thus, on August 3, Auriol had to ask the current Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Mollet, to form a cabinet, but Mollet did not dare to accept the order. Therefore, Auriol had to ask the current Deputy Prime Minister, Pleven of the Democratic Social Resistance Alliance, to come forward to form a cabinet on the same day. This is already the ninth prime ministerial candidate in the French political merry-go-round to try their luck.
    The prolonged French government crisis has caused great confusion and panic within the French reactionary camp. Many reactionary newspapers despairingly published editorials with titles such as "weariness" and "chaos." The Radical Socialist Party's "Aurore" exclaimed: "Whether in domestic affairs or foreign affairs, all French affairs are tragically at a standstill." The semi-official "Le Monde" commented on the debate in the National Assembly on August 3 on Bisch's request for authorization to form a cabinet, saying: "A meeting as anarchic and chaotic as that, if held a few more times, would be enough for France to quickly lose the status of a second-rate country that it had managed to restore." The veteran reactionary newspaper "Le Figaro" even published an editorial entitled "A Sad Phenomenon" saying: Only holding new elections is the only way to solve the current government crisis.
    TASS Paris, July 30th dispatch pointed out: The difficulty in forming a cabinet reflects the extreme dissatisfaction of the people with the anti-national policies implemented by the ruling upper class. French democratic newspapers and progressive groups believe that only by abandoning this policy that leads to destruction can the cabinet crisis be resolved and political difficulties be overcome.

### 法国政府危机长期延续  法反动阵营更加混乱  大选七周后仍拼凑不成政府

　　法国政府危机长期延续
    法反动阵营更加混乱
    大选七周后仍拼凑不成政府
    【新华社四日讯】巴黎消息：在法国大选举行几近七周以后，法国反动派还是组织不出一个政府来，这说明整个法国反动阵营比大选以前是更加混乱和软弱了。
    自从第二次世界大战时臭名远扬的法国投降总理雷诺于七月二十六日放弃了徒劳无功的组阁尝试之后，法国总统阿里奥尔在第二天只得再请已经一度组阁失败的现任财政部长、拉萨尔银行总裁比许再度试行组阁。比许受命后，原来打算举行两个会议：一个是一九四七年以来历届总理会议，另一个是右翼多数派各党领袖会议，以图调和在人民强大的反抗面前各右翼党派内部的矛盾。但是据合众社透露，比许结果仅仅勉强召开了第一个会议，第二个会议就因为“无法使各党聚在一起制订政府纲领”而归于流产。最后，比许和右翼多数派各政党作了七天讨价还价的幕后“协商”之后，在八月二日请求国民议会批准他组阁时，仍然遭到否决。
    这样，阿里奥尔不得不于八月三日请现任副总理、社会党总书记摩勒组阁，但是摩勒不敢应命。于是，阿里奥尔只好在当天再请现任副总理、民主社会抵抗联盟的普利文出面组阁。这已是法国政治走马灯中第九名一试自己命运的总理候选人。
    法国政府危机的长期延续，已在法国反动派内部引起了极大的混乱和恐慌。许多反动报纸都绝望地以“厌倦”、“混乱”为标题来发表社论。激进社会党的《震旦报》惊呼：“不论在内政上或外交上，法国的一切事务都可悲地陷于停顿状态中。”半官方的《世界报》在八月三日评论国民议会中对比许要求授权组阁的辩论情形说：“象那样无政府而纷乱的会议，只消再开上几次，就足够叫法国把好容易才恢复起来的不过是二等国的地位很快地丧失了。”老牌的反动报纸《费加罗报》甚至以《可悲的现象》为题发表社论说：只有重新举行选举，才是解决目前的政府危机的唯一办法。
    塔斯社巴黎七月三十日电指出：组阁问题的困难反映了人民大众对统治上层所执行的反民族政策的极度不满。法国的民主报纸和进步团体认为：唯有抛弃这个导向毁灭的政策，才能解决内阁危机和克服政治上的困难。
