Oil paintings depicting Party history published in the July issue of "People's Pictorial"

The method of using vivid paintings to depict the Party's struggle history has gradually attracted the attention of art workers. During the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China, many newspapers and periodicals across the country published comic strip illustrations depicting the Party's struggle history in popular forms. The July issue of "People's Pictorial" is a special commemorative album for the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China. In addition to publishing many photos from various periods of the Chinese revolution, it also published more than a dozen oil paintings depicting the Party's struggles in various periods. These oil paintings include depictions of the May Fourth Movement, Chairman Mao organizing Marxist groups in Hunan, the Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and peace signatures. Although the quality and quantity of these paintings are not sufficient to represent the heroic and arduous struggles experienced by the Communist Party of China in the past 30 years, it is undoubtedly a good start. Among them, some excellent works, such as "Chairman Mao's Rectification Speech at the Party School in Yan'an in February 1942" (by Luo Gongliu), shows the various different expressions and postures among the audience when Chairman Mao spoke, as well as the atmosphere of consistent concentration and being attracted by his speech. "Chairman Mao Writing in a Cave Dwelling in Yan'an in 1937-38" (by Xin Mang) depicts Chairman Mao writing all night in a simple and quiet cave dwelling in Yan'an. The sky outside the window is already dawning, but he is still holding a pen and thinking. This painting gives people a relatively clear image of a great thinker. "Tunnel Warfare" (by Luo Gongliu) concentrates the characteristics of the outstanding creation of the masses in the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare - tunnel warfare - on the screen from the battle deployment and emotions when the enemy situation occurs: next to a donkey feeding trough, some militiamen are holding guns on guard, and some are taking out grenades to prepare for battle; an old man is pulling a donkey aside, an old woman is pulling out the disguised bottom of the donkey trough, and a female guerrilla fighter is transferring into the tunnel, preparing for tunnel warfare.

Changjiang Daily on Rectifying Writing Style

The Central South Military and Political Committee recently convened a meeting of secretaries-general and directors of offices of directly affiliated agencies, focusing on earnestly exposing and examining the serious situation of "improper writing style" and "too many meetings" in government agencies, and made a "Decision on Rectifying Internal Official Documents, Telegrams, and Meetings of Directly Affiliated Agencies." On August 6th, the Changjiang Daily published an editorial entitled "Rectify Writing Style and Overcome Bureaucracy in Government Agencies!" citing several prominent examples: a company under the Central South Trade Department had as many as 26 routine meetings every week, while the cadres who actually presided over and participated in the meetings were only ten. A company manager had to attend 66 meetings a month. A certain company transported seven carloads of goods, and the reporting items alone amounted to more than 1,700 pieces. In writing, some people even wrote "Resist America and Aid Korea" as "抈" and "Renminbi" as "?". As the editorial said, this kind of situation of too many and too excessive meetings and documents "not only wastes manpower and consumes huge amounts of state funds, but also affects the government's prestige among the people and creates a phenomenon of busy and empty work for cadres in government agencies." The editorial pointed out that this is the result of serious subjectivism, bureaucracy, and lack of organization and discipline, and improper writing style is its manifestation. Therefore, to oppose bureaucracy, we must thoroughly rectify writing style, "disarm the weapons of subjectivists and bureaucrats," so that they have nowhere to hide. Finally, the editorial said: "Do not hold meetings that can be held or not, merge meetings that can be held together, postpone meetings that are not fully prepared, and try to reduce the number of meetings, shorten the meeting time, and enrich the content of the meetings as much as possible; do not issue official documents that can be issued or not, and issue official documents that should be issued after careful study. Advocate writing short articles, saying short words, and holding short meetings, and strive to ensure that every article and every meeting plays its due role." The Changjiang Daily's call and the Central South Military and Political Committee's decision are of great significance for improving work efficiency and deserve attention.

Significant Progress Made by Shanghai's Traditional Chinese Painting Circle in Charity Sales of Calligraphy and Painting Folding Fans

Shanghai's art circles enthusiastically responded to the call to donate "Lu Xun" airplanes and launched a charity sale of calligraphy and painting folding fans. A total of 110 to 120 people participated in this patriotic movement, including fine art workers of traditional Chinese painting, calligraphy, woodcut, cartoon, New Year picture, and oil painting, with a total of more than 400 folding fans produced. This charity sale and donation was mainly led by traditional Chinese painters and combined with the movement to transform traditional Chinese painting. The content of the calligraphy and painting on the folding fans is mostly combined with the current political tasks. One side of the calligraphy is written with poems by Chairman Mao, poems by Lu Xun and patriotic people, poems expressing Resistance to America and Aid Korea and praising the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as poems created by the People's Liberation Army and the People's Volunteers themselves. The theme of the painting side is mostly combined with the main struggles of the Chinese people, such as praising the People's Liberation Army, praising the Chinese People's Volunteers, harnessing the Huai River, using airplanes to eliminate locusts, and land reform. There are also portraits and genre paintings, such as portraits of Lu Xun, Korean folk dances, Xikang dances, and waist drum dances. Through this charity sale and donation movement, Shanghai's traditional Chinese painting circle has begun to correct the erroneous views of pure art that transcend politics and are divorced from real life, and has found a correct direction for its efforts.

Readers Welcome Regular Publication of Various Pictures in Newspapers

People's Daily, Worker's Daily, Shanghai Liberation Daily, Xinwen Daily, and Ta Kung Pao in Beijing regularly publish comic strip illustrations. Because the content of these illustrations is closely combined with the main struggle tasks of the moment, such as using vivid stories of heroes in the Resistance to America and Aid Korea and the heroic deeds of the broad masses of people in the anti-espionage struggle during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as the content of the illustrations, they are expressed through this popular form of illustration, and therefore are welcomed by the broad masses of people. In addition, some newspapers have adopted a variety of picture forms (such as pencil drawings, woodcuts, etc.). The pencil drawings "Sketches of the Korean Battlefield" and "Sketches of the Capital" published in the People's Daily, the "Introduction to the Laboring People's Cultural Palace" in the Beijing Worker's Daily, and the sketches of the Korean battlefield in the Tianjin Daily are also loved by readers. The addition of these pictures to the newspapers has changed the past situation of simply publishing "topical cartoons" (which are also needed by the masses, but current creation is not enough), so that newspapers can more widely contact and educate the masses through a variety of pictures. Therefore, the publication of pictures should attract the attention of newspapers in various places that have not yet published or rarely publish pictures, and should organize various art workers in the local area to publish pictures in newspapers. Art workers in various places should also recognize that using the form of pictures to conduct propaganda and education to the masses through newspapers is the most effective popularization work with the most readers.

Publication of "Historical Materials on the Japanese Peace Treaty Issue"

The People's Publishing House has published "Historical Materials on the Japanese Peace Treaty Issue," which collects international agreements on the Japanese peace treaty issue since 1942, the Soviet government's just propositions on this issue and related issues, the Chinese government's past statements and editorials in this newspaper, and the legitimate opinions of the Japanese people. The articles collected in the appendix expose the consistent conspiracy of American imperialism to arm Japan and turn Japan into its colony and military base for aggression in the Far East. The publication of this book is of great significance at present: it proves that the announcement of the separate draft of the Japanese peace treaty by the American and British imperialists is a completely illegal act of betraying international agreements and infringing upon the rights and interests of China, the Soviet Union, and other countries that fought against Japan.

Southwest Region Carries Out BCG Manufacturing, Research, and Universal Vaccination Work

The BCG Manufacturing Research Institute of the Health Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, the Chongqing General Vaccination Station of the Southwest BCG Promotion Committee, and the Southwest Anti-Tuberculosis Personnel Training Class were established in Chongqing on June 1 after half a year of preparation. After the establishment of these three institutions, BCG manufacturing, research, and universal vaccination will be carried out in the Southwest region. Before the establishment of the BCG Manufacturing Research Institute, it manufactured bacterial vaccines for the first time on March 6. After cultivation experiments and animal experiments, they all met the standards. It has now manufactured eight times. In terms of vaccination, Chongqing is planned to be the key promotion area this year, and vaccination will be carried out in key areas, and then steadily promoted to the entire Southwest region. It is still a pioneering work to carry out BCG manufacturing, research, and universal vaccination in an organized and planned manner in Chongqing and the Southwest region.

　　文化生活动态
    七月号“人民画报”发表表现党史的油画
    用生动的绘画形象来表现党的斗争历史的方法，已逐渐引起美术工作者的注意。在庆祝中国共产党三十周年时，全国许多报纸和刊物都曾发表了用通俗形式表现党的斗争历史的连环图画。七月号“人民画报”，是一个中国共产党三十周年纪念专辑，除发表了中国革命各个时期的许多照片外，还发表了十几幅表现党在各个时期的斗争的油画。这些油画中有表现五四运动、毛主席在湖南组织马克思主义小组的，有表现长征、抗日战争、和平签名的。这些绘画的质量和数量，对于表现中国共产党三十年来所经历的英勇艰苦的斗争说来，虽还不够，但无疑是一个良好的开端。其中有些优秀的作品，如“一九四二年二月毛主席在延安党校发表整风演说”（罗工柳作），将毛主席讲话时，在听众中所引起的各种不同的神情、姿态，而又一致精神贯注、被他的讲话所吸引的气氛表现出来了。“一九三七年—三八年毛主席在延安窑洞里著作”（辛莽作）一幅，描绘毛主席在延安朴实、安静的窑洞里，通宵写作，窗外天已破晓，他尚在执笔运思。这幅画给人一个比较清晰的一位伟大思想家的形象。“地道战”（罗工柳作）把群众在抗日游击战争中的杰出创造—地道战的特征，在画面上从发生敌情时的战斗部署和情绪里，集中地表现出来：在一个喂驴的槽子旁边，有的民兵持枪警戒，有的拿出手榴弹准备战斗；老头子拉着驴子站在一边，老太太把伪装的驴槽底抽掉，一位女游击战士正向地道里转移，准备作地道战。
    长江日报论整顿文风
    中南军政委员会最近召开了直属机关秘书长和办公厅主任会议，着重地认真地揭露和检查了目前政府机关中“文风不正”“会议太多”的严重情况，作了“关于整顿直属机关内部公文、电报、会议的决定”。八月六日长江日报以“整顿文风，克服政府机关中的官僚主义！”为题发表社论，举出几个显著的例子：中南贸易部所属的一个公司每周例会竟达二十六次，而实际主持和参加会议的干部不过十人。一个公司经理，每月要参加六十六次会议。某一公司运输七个车皮的货物，只表报一项竟达一千七百多件。在文字上有人甚至将“抗美援朝”写成“抈”，将“人民币”写成“?”正如社论所说，像这种会议和文件太多太滥的情况“不但浪费人力，耗损国家巨款，而且影响政府在人民群众中的威信，造成机关干部在工作上忙忙碌碌空空洞洞的现象。”社论指出，这是严重的主观主义官僚主义和无组织无纪律的结果，而文风不正是其表现的形式，所以反对官僚主义必须彻底整顿文风，“解除主观主义者和官僚主义者的武器”，使它无藏身之所。最后，社论说：“凡是可开可不开的会议不开，可以合并召开的会议合并召开，准备不成熟的会议缓开，尽可能求得减少会议，缩短会议时间，充实会议内容；凡是可发可不发的公文不发，应发的公文待研究成熟后再发。提倡写短文，说短话，开短会，力期一文一会，都要起到应有的作用。”长江日报的这个号召和中南军政委员会的决定，对于提高工作效率有很大意义，值得重视。
    上海国画界在书画折扇义卖运动中有显著进步
    上海美术界热烈响应捐献“鲁迅号”飞机的号召，展开书画折扇义卖运动。这一爱国运动共有一百一、二十人参加，其中包括国画、书法、木刻、漫画、年画、油画等美术工作者，出品总数有四百多柄。这次义卖捐献是以国画家为主体，结合着国画改造运动进行的。折扇上的书与画的内容，多与目前的政治任务相结合。书的一面写有毛主席所作的诗词，有鲁迅及爱国人士的诗词，有表现抗美援朝与歌颂中国人民志愿军的诗歌，也有人民解放军与人民志愿军自己创作的诗歌等。画的一面，其主题，大多数是结合现在中国人民的主要斗争的，如歌颂人民解放军，歌颂中国人民志愿军，治淮，飞机灭蝗，土地改革等。还有人像和风俗画，如鲁迅画像，朝鲜民间舞，西康舞，打腰鼓等。上海国画界通过这次义卖捐献运动，把国画界超政治、脱离现实生活的纯艺术的错误观点开始纠正过来，找到了一个正确的努力方向。
    读者欢迎报纸上经常刊登各种图画
    北京的人民日报、工人日报、上海解放日报、新闻日报和大公报经常刊登连环图画，由于这些图画的内容大都和当前的主要斗争任务紧密结合，例如以抗美援朝的英雄人物的生动故事及镇压反革命运动中广大人民在反特务斗争中的英勇事迹等作为图画的内容，通过了这一通俗的图画形式来表现，因此受到广大群众的欢迎。除此之外还有一些报纸采用了多种多样的图画形式，（例如铅笔画，木刻等）人民日报刊登的铅笔画“朝鲜战场速写”、“首都速写”，北京工人日报的“劳动人民文化宫介绍”，天津日报的朝鲜战场速写等也受到读者的喜爱。报纸增加了这些图画就改变了过去只是单纯刊登“时事漫画”（这也是群众需要的，目前创作还不够多）的情况，使报纸能够通过多种多样的图画更广泛地联系群众、教育群众。因此刊登图画应当引起各地尚未刊登或很少刊登图画的报纸重视，应当组织当地的各种美术工作者在报纸上发表图画，各地的美术工作者也应当认识用图画的形式通过报纸向群众作宣传教育，是读者最多效力最大的普及工作。
    “对日和约问题史料”出版
    人民出版社出版的“对日和约问题史料”，搜集了一九四二年以来关于对日和约问题的国际协议、苏联政府对于这一问题以及与此相关的各项问题的正义主张、我国政府的历次声明和本报社论以及日本人民的正当意见。书中附录搜集的几篇文章揭露了美帝国主义武装日本、变日本为它的殖民地和侵略远东的军事基地的一贯阴谋。这一书的出版，在目前有重大意义：它证明了美英帝国主义者公布单独对日和约草案是完全背弃国际协议、侵犯中苏及其他对日作战国家权益的非法行为。
    西南区进行卡介苗的制造、研究及普遍接种工作
    西南军政委员会卫生部卡介苗制造研究所，西南卡介苗推行委员会重庆接种总站及西南防痨人员训练班，经半年来的筹备，已于六月一日在重庆成立。这三个机构成立后，即将在西南区进行卡介苗的制造、研究及普遍的接种工作。卡介苗制造研究所在成立之前，即于三月六日第一次制造菌苗，经过培养试验及动物试验，都合乎标准，到现在已制造过八次。在接种方面，计划今年以重庆为重点推行区，由重点的施行接种，再稳步地推广于西南全区。这样有组织、有计划地进行卡介苗的制造、研究及普遍接种工作，在重庆及西南地区还是一个创举。
