Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 9th: The London "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 6th, saying, "The American generals are unwilling to reach an agreement and bring a satisfactory end to the Korean armistice negotiations. This is the only possible explanation for their performance at the armistice conference in recent days." "People remember that when the armistice negotiations began as a result of Malik's proposal, most people predicted that the most contentious issue would be how far the two sides' armies should withdraw from the 38th parallel." "Therefore, when the British people heard that the Americans were demanding a boundary that would seize a large amount of land north of the 38th parallel, they were greatly surprised." The report pointed out that, in addition, the intensification of air force bombing activities during the negotiations, and the new military offensive launched by the US military, also shocked the British people.

The report also stated: "The British people must have felt alarmed and dissatisfied when they heard that British troops were also participating in the new offensive. Many British people have already lost their lives in this dirty war, but British ministers and politicians have failed to protect British lives during the armistice negotiations. It is right for the people to fiercely rebuke them."

The report finally emphasized: "The American generals do not want a ceasefire agreement because such an agreement would ease the tension of the war and would cause the American people to demand a relaxation of war efforts. For almost the same reason, British people of all political persuasions demand a ceasefire agreement, because this is a prelude to a comprehensive solution to the Far East issue and the conclusion of peace treaties between the major powers."

　　伦敦工人日报称：
    英国人民要求达成停战协议
    【新华社布拉格九日电】伦敦工人日报于六日发表社论说：“美国将军们就是不愿朝鲜停火谈判达成协议，完满结束的。这便是他们最近几天来在停火会议上的表现的唯一可能的解释。”“人们都记得，当停火谈判由于马立克的建议而开始举行的时候，大多数人就预料到争执最激烈的问题将是双方军队应撤离三八线多远的问题。”“因此，当英国人民听说美国人所要求的界线要攫取三八线以北大量土地的时候，便使他们大吃一惊。”该报指出：此外，在谈判期间，空军轰炸活动的加强，美军又开始新的军事攻势，这也是使英国人民感到震惊的。
    该报又称：“英国人民听到英国军队也参加了新攻势的消息时，一定感到惊惶和不满。在这次肮脏的战争中丧命的英国人已经不少了，而英国的大臣和政客们却不能在停火谈判期间保护英国人的性命。人民激烈地责骂他们，是一点也不错的。”
    该报最后强调说：“美国将军们不要停火协议，因为这种协议会促使战争紧张局面松弛下来，并会使美国人民要求放松战争努力。几乎由于同样的理由，不论那一种政见的英国人民都要求达成停火协定，因为这是达成远东问题的全面解决和各大国缔结和平公约的前奏。”
