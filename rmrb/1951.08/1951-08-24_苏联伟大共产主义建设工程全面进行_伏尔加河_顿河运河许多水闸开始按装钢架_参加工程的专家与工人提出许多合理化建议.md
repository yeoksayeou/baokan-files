　　Soviet Great Communist Construction Projects in Full Swing
    Steel Frames Being Installed in Many Locks of the Volga-Don Canal
    Experts and Workers Participating in the Project Put Forward Many Rationalization Proposals
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] According to TASS, the great communist construction projects of the Soviet Union are proceeding in full swing.

    Workers on the Volga-Don Canal are piling stones on the riverbed to consolidate it. Construction of the thirteen locks is underway; some are excavating soil, some have begun installing steel frames, and several have completed the cement pouring. The Tsimlyansk Dam, spanning the Don River, is under construction, with more than twenty powerful electric dredgers filling the dam body with soil. In a month, the waters of the Don River will be diverted to flow through this dam. Three reservoirs are being built rapidly on the tributaries of the Don and Volga Rivers. Assembly work has begun, and pumping station equipment is being installed.

    On the Turkmen Main Canal, thousands of scientists are conducting in-depth research on soil, plants, and shifting sands in the Kara-Kum Desert. Several teams from the Soviet Ministry of Forestry's survey team have traveled 10,000 kilometers in the desert for surveying work, completing the mapping of the canal area twenty days ahead of schedule. At the source of the canal, Takhta-Tash, construction workers are building dozens of apartments and enterprise buildings in the new city, and new wharves are being built.

    Workers at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station are excavating soil in the valley on the right bank of the Volga River to build the power plant's foundation. High-efficiency dredgers have already excavated one million cubic meters of soil. High-voltage power transmission lines have been erected on the left bank of the Volga River, and construction of the locks has begun. Construction workers are piling one million cubic meters of soil to form a water-retaining dam and building a sixteen-meter-high, four-kilometer-long embankment to protect the foundation of the locks from flood damage. Large-scale housing construction is underway on both sides of the river.

    At the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, preparations for building the power plant have been completed. Waterways and roads leading to the construction site have been built on both sides of the Volga River. Workers' residential areas are under construction.

    Experts and workers participating in the communist construction projects have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity. For example, the Association of Engineers and Technicians established at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station construction site has put forward sixty-three inventions and rationalization proposals in a very short period, greatly accelerating the progress of the construction project and reducing construction costs. Construction workers at the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Station, a major project of the Volga-Don Canal, set a new work record in July, pouring 145,000 cubic meters of concrete. Khudyakov, a excavator driver working on the Don River bend, excavated 3,145 cubic meters of soil in one shift, breaking the previous record.

　　苏联伟大共产主义建设工程全面进行
    伏尔加河——顿河运河许多水闸开始按装钢架
    参加工程的专家与工人提出许多合理化建议
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联的伟大共产主义建设工程正全面进行着。
    伏尔加河——顿河运河的工人正在河底堆砌石块以巩固河床。十三道水闸的建设工作正在进行着，有些水闸上正在挖掘泥土，有些已开始按装钢架，有几道水闸已经完成了浇灌水泥的工作。横跨顿河的齐姆良堤坝在建筑中，二十多架强大的电动吸泥机正在用泥土填满堤身。一个月以后，顿河河水就要改道流过这条堤坝。在顿河和伏尔加河的支流上，正在加速建造三个水库。装配工作已经开始，抽水站的设备正在装置起来。
    在土库曼大运河，数千名科学家深入卡拉·库姆沙漠研究土壤、植物和流沙。苏联林业部调查队的几个小组，在沙漠中旅行了一万公里进行勘查工作，已提前二十天完成了运河地区的绘图工作。在运河发源处塔赫亚·塔什，建筑工人正在建造新城市中的几十座公寓和企业大厦，新的码头正在建造着。
    古比雪夫水电站的工人正在伏尔加河右岸的山谷挖掘泥土，来修建电力厂的地基。高效率的挖泥机已经挖了一百万公方的泥土。伏尔加河左岸已架设了高压电力输送线，并已开始建筑水闸。建筑工人正在把一百万立方公尺的泥土堆成拒水堰，并建立一道十六公尺高四公里长的堤坝，以保护水闸的基础免受洪水的冲刷损害。河流两岸都在进行着大规模的房屋建筑。
    在斯大林格勒水电站，建筑电力厂的准备工作已经完成。伏尔加河两岸已经建筑了通往工地的水道和公路。职工住宅区正在建筑起来。
    参加共产主义建设工程的专家和工人们，表现了高度的劳动热情和创造性。例如，在古比雪夫水电站工地成立的工程师和技术人员协会，已在很短的时间内提出了六十三件发明和合理化建议，大大地加速了建设工程的进行，并且减低了建筑成本。伏尔加河——顿河运河的主要工程之一，——齐姆良水电站的建筑工人，在七月间创造了新的工作纪录，浇灌了十四万五千公方的混凝土。在顿河河湾上工作的挖凿机司机胡德雅科夫，在一个工作班的时间内挖土三千一百四十五公方，打破了过去的纪录。
