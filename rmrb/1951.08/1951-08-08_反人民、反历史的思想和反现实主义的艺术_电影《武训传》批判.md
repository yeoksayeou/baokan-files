The editorial "We Should Pay Attention to the Discussion on the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'" published on May 20 in the People's Daily has sparked a widespread and heated discussion among the literary and artistic circles, educational circles, social science circles, and the general intellectual community regarding Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun." This is a very serious ideological debate. The central issue of the debate concerns the historical path of the Chinese people: Is the path taken by the Chinese people a revolutionary one, or is it a path of reformism and capitulationism? This is a major principle that must be correctly answered.

Over the past two months, many comrades have conducted a serious critique of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," the illustrated biography of Wu Xun, and all other reactionary propaganda about Wu Xun. The recently published "Investigation Report on the History of Wu Xun" has provided an irrefutable logical conclusion about the issue of Wu Xun and has also set a good example in the methods of historical research, social investigation, and literary criticism. I myself watched the film "The Life of Wu Xun" quite some time ago, but I was not able to fully recognize and promptly point out its serious political reactionary nature. Although I criticized the film at the First National Cultural Administrative Conference in March, after reading many articles and materials from comrades, I feel that my criticism at the time was far from sufficient. Now, the history of Wu Xun has been completely clarified; however, regarding the film "The Life of Wu Xun" itself, which triggered this debate, a systematic critique of its ideology and art is still needed. This article is written for this purpose.

Two Historical Views

The film "The Life of Wu Xun" is a biographical film concerning modern Chinese history. There are two different viewpoints on history.

One viewpoint holds that history is not created by class struggle but by a few so-called enlightened individuals; that the darkness of society is not due to the existence of irrational institutions but because the people themselves lack education and culture. Therefore, to reform society, it is not necessary to go through the revolutionary struggle of the masses to overthrow the old system and establish a new one. It is only necessary to provide the people with education and culture to achieve a new, bright world. Therefore, the creators and promoters of history are mainly not the laboring people but the cultured and educated individuals and those who are eager to spread "education" and "culture" among the people. This is an anti-people, anti-scientific viewpoint on history. Propagating this viewpoint is to disarm the masses ideologically, spread illusions, and make the masses have a false sense that under the old social system, without the revolutionary methods of the masses but through certain reform methods, their living conditions can be fundamentally improved. Sun Yu, in the film "The Life of Wu Xun," skillfully propagates this idea through artistic means. He portrays Wu Xun's "promotion of education" as the most reliable path for the laboring people to seek liberation. Thus, he portrays Wu Xun—this most despicable, most hypocritical, and most reactionary servant of feudal society, this ardent propagandist of decayed feudal culture—as a "fighter who struggled against the feudal rulers all his life," no, simply as a sanctified figure: "He smiles from the clouds to the world below, blessing his fellow laborers of the same class who are obtaining liberation." In this way, this historical reactionary becomes an ancestor of the Chinese people's revolution, and the liberated Chinese people become the successors of Wu Xun's cause. For the Chinese people, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition and are now bravely and resolutely fighting on the front lines of the global anti-imperialist struggle, is this not a great slander? Is such slander tolerable?

Another viewpoint, completely opposite to the above, holds that since the foundation of human society is composed of production, the creators and promoters of human history are primarily the laboring people who produce material wealth. The laboring people, in their daily creation of material wealth, continuously create history. Especially at critical turning points in history, when new social forces rise to struggle against old social forces, the outcome of the struggle is always determined by the broad masses of the people. The masses of the people are the main promoters of history. Every major progress or change in history must go through the serious struggle of the masses of the people and cannot be accomplished by a few so-called enlightened individuals. Any hero, only when he correctly represents the direction of historical progress, represents or at least in some important aspects represents the will and interests of the broad masses of the people, can he become a true hero. If he goes against the direction of historical progress and the will and interests of the broad masses of the people, no matter how outstanding his personal qualities, talents, and perseverance, or even how "unique" his deeds, he can only become a pitiful and laughable figure and will ultimately be thrown into the historical garbage bin. Only by measuring and evaluating historical figures based on this viewpoint can it be correct. Therefore, our literature and art can only sing the praises of those who promote historical progress and contribute to the people, and should never sing the praises of historical reactionaries or those who contribute nothing to the people. We especially respect our own national revolutionary traditions. We want to correctly connect the people's struggles today with the past revolutionary traditions. Therefore, we cannot tolerate any distortion or insult to the people's revolutionary traditions. Many comrades criticized the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and other erroneous articles about Wu Xun, mainly starting from this fundamental point. This is the people's and scientific viewpoint on history.

The people's and scientific viewpoint on history and the anti-people and anti-scientific viewpoint on history, this is the distinction between Marxism-Leninism and bourgeois reactionary thought.

Many petty-bourgeois intellectuals waver between the two. Although they acknowledge the role of the masses' revolutionary struggle in history, their understanding of this role is often abstract, and their assessment is often insufficient. Due to their personal background and upbringing, when they explain specific historical or social phenomena, they often consciously or unconsciously regard culture as above all else, regard individual strength as above the strength of the masses, and are particularly interested in individual struggles and achievements, even in individual so-called "unique people and unique events." This is greatly related to the fact that China's industry is underdeveloped, small-scale production is absolutely dominant, the petty bourgeoisie is numerous, and culture is backward. These petty-bourgeois intellectuals have formed the social basis for the blind admiration of Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun." Their blind admiration for Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun" is, on the one hand, due to being deceived by the reactionary propaganda about Wu Xun, and on the other hand, it is precisely because this reactionary propaganda has taken advantage of their lack of historical perspective and lack of mass perspective, catering to their individualistic thoughts, emotions, and psychology. This is why, even after Wu Xun's true face has been exposed, some people still find various reasons to defend Wu Xun, and some people even deny Wu Xun rationally but still sympathize with him emotionally.

So, what exactly is so bewitching about Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun"?

Wu Xun is not an important figure in history; he is just one of the various servants of the reactionary feudal rulers, but he is a particularly special one, with a special hypocrisy and deception. The film "The Life of Wu Xun" uses historical fabrication and artistic exaggeration to depict him as a revolutionary figure and national hero. Thus, a feudal corpse dressed in revolutionary clothes struts into the ranks of the people, spreading poison. Therefore, to criticize the film "The Life of Wu Xun," we must first expose Wu Xun's true face. Many critics have conducted this exposure from various angles, and the Wu Xun Historical Investigation Team has conducted a comprehensive and thorough exposure.

Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun" have their bewitching points. Naturally, many people are bewitched not only because they are unaware of the historical truth about Wu Xun but mainly because they lack the ability to distinguish things from a Marxist-Leninist perspective.

Wu Xun was born into a poor peasant family, transforming from a beggar into a usurer and landlord. His life history is basically that of a parasite and exploiter. According to the investigation by the Wu Xun Historical Investigation Team, in his entire life, Wu Xun had only over a year of labor, and the labor he engaged in was only some light tasks like chopping grass and grinding grain, not the main labor in production. In his begging life, although he sometimes still did some chopping grass and grinding grain, that was merely an ornament to his begging life or, like his magic tricks, just a part of his begging performance. He had actually completely broken away from the peasant class and become a professional beggar, and a beggar who used various rogue methods. The film "The Life of Wu Xun" depicts him as a faithful son of the laboring people, especially emphasizing his lifelong labor, saying that "except for the time he slept in the temple, his hands never rested," thus covering up the parasitic and decadent nature of his life. However, if we observe the problem from a scientific and class perspective, then the beggar class, to which beggars belong, is unrelated to the true laboring class of workers and peasants. Beggars are parasites and have great destructive power; they can easily become tools of counter-revolution. This was mentioned by Marx and Engels in "The Communist Manifesto" over a hundred years ago. In fact, reactionary rulers have always chosen, cultivated, and promoted their running dogs from the beggar class. Wu Xun's historical path also precisely proves this truth. Wu Xun is not an ordinary beggar but a political beggar who uses the banner of "promoting education." With this banner, not only is begging more convenient, but more importantly, he found a way to communicate with the feudal ruling class. He indeed obtained the support and sponsorship of wealthy landlords and officials, enabling him to establish the so-called "private schools." He himself also became a landlord and usurer. But he is different from ordinary landlords. Although he is the owner of over three hundred acres of land and lends money at a rate exceeding the highest standard at that time, his land is nominally school land, and his rent collection and lending are all done in the name of "promoting education," thus hiding his identity as a landlord and usurer from the public. Feudal landlords come in various forms: there are religious landlords who own temple land, and the monk Le Zhen, who cooperated with Wu Xun to establish the second "private school," belongs to this type of landlord; there are also political landlords who own school land and other public land, and Wu Xun is such a political landlord. Wu Xun, under the banner of "promoting education," relying on the power of landlord gentry and officials, seized a large amount of land and usury capital, ruthlessly and cruelly exploiting peasants. The impoverished peasants in the area called Wu Xun a "money-grubber." Wu Xun's exploitative behavior, even in many of his biographies that praise him, cannot help but reveal some of it, but in the film, it is completely covered up. Wu Xun's attitude towards his family: "My affairs, you don't need to interfere, brothers dividing the family is none of your business," "not caring about relatives, not caring about friends," is not, as some admirers of Wu Xun say, a manifestation of Wu Xun's impartiality in kinship relations, but precisely a manifestation of Wu Xun, as a landlord and usurer, being cold and decisive in his exploitative relationship with peasants (including his own brothers). This can be seen as Wu Xun's declaration of betraying the peasant class he was born into and surrendering to the landlord class. From then on, Wu Xun befriended the big landlord bullies like Lou Junling, Yang Shufang, and Shi Shanzheng, becoming their guest of honor.

The harm of Wu Xun lies in the fact that although he became a landlord and usurer, he always wore the clothes of a beggar and continued to use various rogue methods in begging and strengthening almsgiving. He became a political landlord dressed as a beggar. If he took off these clothes, his deceptive effect would be lost, at least greatly reduced. However, if we determine a person's class status not based on his surface lifestyle but only based on his relationship to the means of production, then, apart from the conclusion that he is a landlord and usurer, there can be no other conclusion about Wu Xun.

The more bewitching aspect of Wu Xun is his "promotion of education." Wu Xun's "promotion of education," along with his printing of good books and rewarding filial piety, is completely a propaganda of the most reactionary and decayed feudal culture and feudal morality, serving the feudal landlord class wholeheartedly; however, the film "The Life of Wu Xun" depicts his "promotion of education" as an act of opposing feudal landlord rule and seeking liberation for peasants. Wu Xun is depicted as having a "mind that is not at all feudal" and "firmly and unyieldingly struggling against the feudal rulers all his life" as a revolutionary hero. This is a great deception. The slogan of "promoting education" can deceive people, not only in Wu Xun's lifetime but also today, after his death, this slogan still has the power to bewitch people.

"Promoting education is always a good thing," many supporters and sympathizers of Wu Xun say, as if denying Wu Xun is to belittle education. We should value education, but we should not regard education as being above class and politics. Comrade Stalin has a very good passage in his "Conversation with the British Writer H.G. Wells":

"Education is a weapon, the effectiveness of which depends on who holds it in their hands and who is struck by it. Of course, the proletariat and socialism need people with higher education. It is clear that as long as one is not the most stupid person, one can help the proletariat to struggle for socialism and build a new society. I do not belittle the role of intellectuals; on the contrary, I emphasize their role more. The question is only about which kind of intellectuals, because intellectuals come in various types."

The facts are clear: the "private schools" that Wu Xun established were completely under the control of feudal landlords. Establishing "private schools" was not Wu Xun's innovation. As early as the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the feudal rulers had established many "private schools" in various places. Zhang Yao, the Shandong Governor who with one hand bloodily suppressed the peasant revolution and with the other hand promoted Wu Xun, was an active advocate of "private schools." So, what kind of "private schools" are these? Are they striking against landlords or peasants? What kind of intellectuals are cultivated by these "private schools"? Are they in support of peasant interests or landlord interests? Isn't it obvious to see? Wu Xun himself sang: "There are many bad people and few good people, establishing a private school is not wrong." Wu Xun's "promotion of education" precisely catered to the reactionary policy of the feudal rulers at that time to win hearts and minds, so the "private school" became his political capital to surrender to the feudal ruling class and climb into the ranks of the landlord class.

"In feudal society, only feudal education can be provided, and Wu Xun cannot be blamed." Wu Xun's supporters and sympathizers say this, as if denying Wu Xun is to deny all education in past eras.

We do not generally deny the education of feudal society and capitalist society, and we acknowledge the definite role of education in various historical eras, while new education is precisely developed from old education. In this regard, we not only need to distinguish Wu Xun from Tao Xingzhi but also need to distinguish Wu Xun from Confucius. Tao Xingzhi's path is from a bourgeois reformist to a revolutionary democrat, and his educational theories contain many idealist elements, which is his ideological weakness. His erroneous praise for Wu Xun is precisely a manifestation of this ideological weakness. But in terms of his overall political orientation and his efforts in his later years to revolutionize the content of his educational activities, he is undoubtedly one of the outstanding educators of the Chinese people. Wu Xun cannot be compared with him. Confucius is a great educator of feudal society; he is different from Wu Xun not only because he lived over two thousand years ago when the feudal system was thriving and feudal culture was shining brightly, while the era Wu Xun lived in was when the foundation of feudal rule was facing final collapse, and the feudal culture, as the superstructure of this foundation, had decayed to the point of losing any vitality; but also because Confucius made outstanding contributions in educational thought and methods, while Wu Xun was merely a fraud who used "promoting education" as a cover, knowing nothing and being unable to do anything about education. Some educators place Wu Xun, such a person, in the history of education alongside Tao Xingzhi and Confucius, even higher than Tao Xingzhi and Confucius, which is indeed a disgraceful thing in the educational community.

"Wu Xun promoted education for poor children; his motives were good." This is the most common and appealing reason for defending Wu Xun. The film "The Life of Wu Xun" exaggerates Wu Xun's sincere concern for poor children.

Whether Wu Xun's motives were truly to "promote education for poor children" cannot be judged solely based on the "promoting education for the poor" signboard that Wu Xun put up, but must be specifically examined based on the actual content and effects of the "private schools" that Wu Xun established.

Originally, Wu Xun's "private schools," whether in terms of funding sources, teaching content, or student composition, were completely under the control of the landlord class from the beginning. The film "The Life of Wu Xun" insists on saying that it was only after Wu Xun's death that the landlords seized them. Wu Xun's promotion of education was originally based on the slogan of "having a good name and doing good deeds, the Heavenly Emperor of Literature knows and will make your descendants ride in sedan chairs forever." The film, however, fabricates scenes that are the opposite: Wu Xun hears students reading "learning to be an official," and his heart feels so confused and painful; he sheds tears and repeatedly admonishes his students: "When you finish your studies, never forget us poor people!" Finally, he says with such confidence: "I cannot rest! Until every poor child has books to read and food to eat... I will not rest." All these descriptions are just to make the audience believe that no matter what the objective effects of the "private schools" are, Wu Xun's burning heart is always for poor children, for peasants. Is this true? Just one piece of evidence can answer this question. According to the investigation by the Wu Xun Historical Investigation Team, the first school Wu Xun established, "Chongxian Private School," had no primary education for the first seven years, only a class for scriptures, and all the students in the scripture class were children of landlords, rich peasants, and merchants. Poor peasant children could not enter the scripture class. If Wu Xun's heart was truly for poor children, then for seven years, his school had no poor children, couldn't he see that? Obviously, there was no place for poor children in his heart.

Motives are originally subjective things, and we can only have the basis and possibility to examine his motives when a person's subjective motives turn into actions and produce objective effects. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "Social practice is the criterion for testing subjective wishes, and effect is the criterion for testing motives." And the goodness or badness of the effect is judged by whether it is beneficial or harmful to the people. Motives for the people and effects beneficial to the people must be unified. If a person's motives are truly to serve the people wholeheartedly, then he must necessarily take a very responsible attitude towards what he does for the people, and once he discovers that any of his actions are not beneficial to the people, he must immediately correct them. Whether a person can expose and correct his own mistakes and shortcomings is the most important criterion for judging whether his motives are good. Criticism and self-criticism are the most reliable and good methods to unify the motives for the people with the effects beneficial to the people. Those who observe things not from a materialist and mass perspective but from an idealist and individual perspective always like to emphasize motives one-sidedly and ignore effects. Those who do not want or dare not seriously carry out criticism and self-criticism always like to use "motives" as a shield.

The film "The Life of Wu Xun" and all Wu Xun propagandists particularly sing the praises of Wu Xun's spirit, such as "thirty years like one day," "selflessness," "perseverance," "austerity," and in the film "The Life of Wu Xun," they even mix Wu Xun's spirit with the great thought of "serving the people" advocated by Marxists and Leninists. From here, the most bewitching effect of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" is produced.

People sympathize with and admire Wu Xun's austerity. However, if we analyze it a bit, we can see that his austerity is merely a combination of fraudulent tricks (such as eating poison, eating tiles, drinking dirty water) and the behavior of a slave kneeling and kowtowing. As for eating coarse food, sleeping in broken temples, not marrying, etc., regardless of whether Wu Xun's actual behavior was like this, these facts themselves are what kind of austerity? If these are called austerity, then the tens of millions of laboring people in the country are not greater austerity practitioners?

Marxists and Leninists oppose individual austerity, not only because austerity goes against the natural laws of human life, but more importantly, this individual austerity not only cannot relieve or reduce the suffering of the masses but deepens the suffering of the masses. The oppressed and exploited laboring masses live in pain every day; they have suffered enough and do not need any more austerity. They long for the early relief or reduction of their own suffering. Only a few people who have eaten their fill and are bored with life advocate austerity, seeking their own pleasure from the suffering of others. Only reactionary artists beautify the suffering of the oppressed humanity.

It is true that we have always advocated the spirit of hard struggle. But we are not struggling for the sake of struggling, nor do we take self-suffering as joy; rather, we are for the purpose of liberating all the suffering people in the world and leading them to a happy life. It is this great and noble purpose that inspires us to endure all pain and hardship, even to the point of sacrificing our lives. This hard struggle is completely different from or completely opposite to any so-called "austerity" that does not dare to rebel, does not dare to revolutionize, and does not dare to sacrifice one's life. Precisely because of this, the reactionary rulers of ancient and modern times, domestic and foreign, not only do not propagate the suffering of the entire laboring people but also do not propagate the sacrifices of revolutionaries. Instead, they are willing to propagate that kind of "austerity" that is harmless to the rulers and therefore the rulers do not need to harm them. Many intellectuals, due to not having experienced the great struggles of the masses, the great storms of the masses, always cannot fully appreciate the deep suffering of the masses and the greatness of the masses' struggles, but are only infatuated with various forms of individual austerity and their successes. They do not know that any individual, separated from the masses, will become powerless and cannot have any real achievements.

The film "The Life of Wu Xun" particularly emphasizes that Wu Xun possesses the spirit of "bowing his head to be an ox for the children" as Lu Xun said. Sun Yu, in his article "Before and After Directing 'The Life of Wu Xun,'" said: "Lu Xun's famous saying has been written in my script from beginning to end." However, in fact, Wu Xun did not bow his head to the laboring people, nor did he become an "ox" for the laboring people. On the contrary, he only asked the children to bow their heads to him, to the landlord class, and also to Wu Xun himself. Moreover, Lu Xun's poem has two lines, and his first line is "frowning at a thousand accusing fingers," but Sun Yu deliberately hid this. To the people, bend over backwards, die for the people; to the enemies of the people, even the most ferocious enemies, never bow down. This is the inseparable meaning of Lu Xun's two famous lines. It is also what Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Be lenient to oneself, be ruthless to the enemy." Only by combining these two aspects can one become a revolutionary, and this is the correct and complete concept of "serving the people." The propagandists of Wu Xun vulgarize the slogan of "serving the people," cutting off its class and revolutionary content. "Serving the people," first of all, is not an empty slogan but a specific class content, a slogan full of fighting spirit. One cannot look at the people in general but must analyze the concept of the people, which includes several classes; serving the people means first serving the working and peasant masses, because they constitute the majority of the people; they are the producers, and workers are the most advanced class in human history. Second, serving the people means conducting a resolute struggle against all enemies of the people, helping the people to overthrow the reactionaries oppressing them and eliminating the influence of the reactionaries among the people. Comrade Mao Zedong describes Lu Xun's character like this: "Lu Xun's bones are the hardest; he has not an ounce of servility or flattery, which is the most precious quality of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries." In "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Comrade Mao Zedong also describes the courage that a true revolutionary should possess: "In the face of beasts, one must not show any cowardice; we must learn from Wu Song's bravery on the Scenic Ridge." What we need is the tenacious spirit of Lu Xun and the brave spirit of Wu Song fighting the tiger on the Scenic Ridge. In any situation, we oppose bowing to the enemy; that is a despicable, traitorous behavior. The fighting slogan of "serving the people" must be distinguished from the hypocritical service spirit of the bourgeoisie.

The main deeds of Wu Xun's life, which have been praised by Wu Xun propagandists, are "begging," "promoting education," and "austerity." The film "The Life of Wu Xun" puts these originally backward and reactionary but still bewitching deeds in a more bewitching, progressive, and revolutionary outer garment. Thus, "begging" becomes labor, "promoting education" becomes a struggle against feudal rulers, and "austerity" becomes an example of "serving the people wholeheartedly." After idealizing Wu Xun in this way, Mr. Sun Yu still says that he depicted Wu Xun with a "critical eye," turning historical revisionism into historical criticism; turning the clever praise of Wu Xun into criticism. In his article "Before and After Directing 'The Life of Wu Xun,'" he said: "Apart from praising Wu Xun's selflessness to serve as an example for serving the people, the film also criticizes his reformist and individual heroism style." Since it is "individual heroism," why is there a "selflessness" that can serve as an example for serving the people? Can these two coexist and be compatible? The author in this passage either said double-layered falsehoods or fell into double errors: First, Wu Xun did not walk the path of reformism and individual heroism but the path of complete capitulationism and servility; second, the author did not criticize reformism and individual heroism in the film but, on the contrary, used Wu Xun's so-called "begging and promoting education" deeds to greatly advocate backward, reactionary social reformism and individual heroism. The reactionary nature of the theme of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" is mainly here.

The reactionary propaganda about Wu Xun has its historical and social roots.

The reactionary rulers, from the Qing Dynasty to Chiang Kai-shek, successively praised Wu Xun, which is not surprising because Wu Xun is a useful tool for maintaining their reactionary rule. What is noteworthy is that their praise for Wu Xun was always when they felt their rule was shaky. The Qing court awarded Wu Xun the title "kind and benevolent" as an honor in 1888, twenty-four years after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and twenty-three years before the Xinhai Revolution, when the feudal order had suffered the impact of the peasant revolutionary wave and was rapidly beginning to disintegrate, and the peasant revolution was becoming the herald of a new era. The Kuomintang reactionaries launched the 97th anniversary of Wu Xun's birth in 1934, with Chiang Kai-shek specially writing a commemorative inscription for Wu Xun from the then anti-revolutionary military center in Nanchang, and in 1938, the Kuomintang reactionary government, with Lin Sen, Kong Xiangxi, He Shitian, and Chen Lifu jointly signing, formally issued an order to praise Wu Xun. This was precisely when the people of the whole country were marching towards the peak of the anti-Japanese movement, and the revolutionary forces of the people were developing forward after twists and turns. This shows that: when the reactionary rulers are about to perish, they are like a person falling into water, grasping everything that floats on the water and can be grabbed to save their own drowning, and Wu Xun is the dregs stirred up in the peasant revolutionary wave and grabbed by the reactionary rulers as a treasure.

Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have overthrown the internal and external oppressors with their brave, tenacious, and resolute struggles. Wu Xun, who was praised by the reactionary ruling class in the past, should have no place in the new China. Why is the propaganda about Wu Xun not only not disappearing but even flourishing? This is the manifestation of bourgeois reactionary thought, which still has its market in today's China. During the period of Kuomintang reactionary rule, the bourgeoisie, on the one hand, was dissatisfied with the tyranny and brutality of this rule, and on the other hand, did not believe in and feared the power of the masses. Therefore, they did not dare to resolutely fight against the reactionary ruling class but often tried to find a way to achieve reform without struggle.

Tao Xingzhi, in his later years, became a revolutionary democrat, but in advocating Wu Xun, he showed the influence of his early reformist thoughts; he showed his weak side in the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries.

Title: The Reactionary Nature of the Film "The Story of Wu Xun"

After the Chinese people achieved national victory, the bourgeoisie participated in the people's democratic government. However, a part of them still felt sorrow and nostalgia for the old system and old things that were dying or had already died. They showed indifference and skepticism towards new things and expressed hesitation and fear towards the further development of the people's revolution. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "The social and economic position of the national bourgeoisie determines their weakness. They lack foresight, lack sufficient courage, and many of them fear the masses." The vanguard of the Chinese working class—the Communist Party—has a special responsibility to engage in a serious and resolute struggle against various reactionary and erroneous thoughts of the bourgeoisie that sabotage or hinder the people's democratic dictatorship. We must eliminate their influence within the people, especially among the advanced elements and Communist Party members. In every serious political struggle, we must oppose various forms of reformism and capitulationism; otherwise, the struggle cannot proceed to victory. During the Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid to Korea, we first opposed the thoughts of pro-Americanism, fear of America, and admiration for America. During the land reform, we first opposed the idea of "peaceful land distribution." During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, we first opposed the idea of "boundless leniency."

The film "The Story of Wu Xun" is one of the artistic expressions of the reactionary reformist thoughts of the bourgeoisie. The film uses the so-called "begging to promote education" deeds of Wu Xun to propagate reformist thoughts through artistic means: without touching the old social and economic foundations and without destroying the old political system, as long as education is popularized among the people, the oppressed status of the people can be fundamentally changed. Since people can be liberated by having culture, there is naturally no need for the masses' armed revolutionary struggle.

The film spent more than a thousand feet of film to depict Wu Xun's dream scene (the so-called "Three Dreams" in Sun Yu's film novel "The Story of Wu Xun"). This is precisely the expression of the author's theme. In this dream and fantasy, the author depicts the history of human society:

"Moaning and turning over at the feet, at the tip of the whip, sweating and bleeding are countless peasants... like oxen and horses under the blood-stained heavy shackles and chains, pulling the plow heavily... the giant mill opens its big mouth devouring countless lives... blood flows into a red river; flesh and bones are squeezed into sticky paste... the laboring masses generation after generation are forever unable to escape the dark and painful cycle... Zhang Juren's sneer suddenly turns the giant mill into a large stone inkstone, black ink is ground out, splashing poisonous liquid, splashing into the eyes of the 'illiterates'..."

"Men, women, old and young... stretching out their hands, leaning on their sticks, straining to open their eyes that cannot see things, walking cautiously on the 'Bridge of Helplessness,' to the left is a steep cliff, to the right is a bottomless abyss, behind them is Zhang Juren with a pen like a dagger; Zhao Xiong and Wei Jun with disheveled hair, holding up big pens and giant ink, driving them forward, in front of the single-plank bridge, a cold wind and mournful cries rise up..."

"'You illiterate beasts,' the devil landlord laughs and shouts, 'You blind fools! I have thrown you all into the sea of suffering, making you unable to rise again forever! Ha ha...'" (Film novel: "The Story of Wu Xun" page 101)

Originally, the miserable life of the peasants was not the result of the political and economic oppression and exploitation of the feudal landlord class, but merely because the peasants were deprived by the landlord class of the right to education, the peasants themselves were illiterate, their eyes "could not see things." So, what way is there to "rise up"? It is only to "study culture."

When Wu Xun heard about the private school in his dream, he joyfully shouted, "Isn't this flying from the ground to the sky?..." He raised his arm and shouted, "Poor children, come with me to study!" Wu Xun woke up from this happy dream, opened his eyes and looked around, as if he had come to a new bright world. Those who do not know how to read are destined for hell, those who study can go to heaven. This is the central idea of the film "The Story of Wu Xun." "Only by studying can one know more about the world; only then can one find the way to a good life..." This passage, described by the author as containing "profound wisdom," is it not the words of the author's own heart, the author's own thoughts?

This kind of thought is not something new. As early as 1923, in his article "On Our Revolution," Lenin severely criticized the social democrats of the Second International, those "timid and cowardly reformists," who insisted that socialism could only be achieved after a certain level of culture was reached. Lenin sharply refuted: Why not first use revolutionary means to create the necessary conditions for this level of culture, that is, first drive out the landlords and Russian capitalists, and then advance towards socialism? In the same year, in his famous article "On Cooperation," he also said that before the revolution, the focus of work could only be on political struggle, revolution, and seizing power, while only after the revolution could the focus of work be shifted to peaceful and extensive cultural construction. Of course, Lenin was correct. The historical experience of the Russian revolution fully confirmed his prediction.

Comrade Mao Zedong, in his famous "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" written in 1927, also said: "In China, it has always been the landlords who have culture, while the peasants have none. But the culture of the landlords is created by the peasants, because the things that create the culture of the landlords are not anything else, but the blood and sweat taken from the peasants. In China, there are ninety percent of the people who have not received cultural education, and the largest part of this is the peasants. In the countryside, once the power of the landlords is overthrown, the cultural movement of the peasants begins... The peasant movement develops, and the cultural level of the peasants rapidly improves. In a short time, the whole province will have tens of thousands of schools springing up in the countryside, not like the intellectuals and so-called 'educators' who merely call for 'universal education,' calling and calling but still just empty words."

Of course, Comrade Mao Zedong was correct, and the historical experience of the Chinese revolution fully confirmed his prediction.

The experience of the Chinese revolution is like this: first, mobilize the peasants for armed struggle, overthrow the reactionary rule in the vast countryside, and establish revolutionary bases; then, on this base, gradually develop the economy and culture of the people. Now, due to the national victory of the Chinese people, especially the implementation of land reform throughout the country, the culture of the peasants has achieved unprecedented rapid and widespread development. It can be predicted that in the near future, as Comrade Mao Zedong predicted in his "Opening Speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," "We will appear before the world as a nation with a high level of culture."

It is interesting to note that a country that was once culturally backward compared to other capitalist advanced countries in Europe, with many illiterates, and a country that had a brilliant culture in ancient times but was lagging behind in modern times, with a particularly large number of illiterates, it is precisely these two countries, one in the West and one in the East, that first achieved great revolutionary victories. The Soviet Union is not only the most culturally advanced country in the world but is also standing at the peak of human culture, guiding the direction of the world's people; the new culture of the people of New China is advancing by leaps and bounds. The reason is very simple: socialist revolution and people's revolution have created the premise for the unlimited development of people's culture.

It is true that Mr. Sun Yu said in his article "How I Portrayed Wu Xun's 'Dream'" that "without revolution, without seizing power, the fate of the poor being oppressed cannot be changed by just studying." However, first, an artist's verbal expression and what he actually expresses in his art are not always the same thing, and what is often expressed in the work is the author's more genuine thoughts and feelings. The reader can only judge the author from the work; second, whether it is the social democrats or the bourgeois reformists, they generally do not deny revolution in words. They even pretend to be very fond of the revolution, saying that the masses want revolution, first they need culture, thus actually denying the revolution in practice. The film "The Story of Wu Xun" is precisely the propagation of this erroneous thought.

The film "The Story of Wu Xun" depicts the "private school movement" represented by Wu Xun, and at the same time, it also depicts the peasant revolution represented by Zhou Da, which the author calls "one Wu and one Zhou," complementing each other. However, this not only did not save but even deepened the erroneous theme of the film "The Story of Wu Xun." The friendship between Wu Xun and Zhou Da is a complete fabrication contrary to historical facts, because it is obvious that the reactionaries and the revolutionaries cannot establish such a friendly and cooperative relationship in their work. The author here only uses Zhou Da as a foil for Wu Xun, exaggerating the failures and weaknesses of the peasant armed struggle to highlight the greatness of Wu Xun's spirit and the at least some degree of success of his educational mission. Thus, the reactionary nature of the theme of the film "The Story of Wu Xun" is even more apparent.

Wu Xun was born in the period of the peasant revolutionary upsurge in China; Shandong was for many years one of the main areas of activity of the Nian Army, and in the village where he was born, Tangyi, there was a peasant uprising led by the famous Song Jingpo. In 1860, in the village of Xiaoliuquan, which is only seven miles away from Wu Xun's village of Wuzhuang, there was a peasant uprising led by the famous Song Jingpo. Five miles away from Wuzhuang is Liu Lin Town, which was a stronghold of the counter-revolutionary armed forces of the landlords. The militia of Liu Lin was the most ferocious and stubborn; the commander was not someone else, but the uncle of Yang Shufang, who supported Wu Xun in establishing the first private school and was described in the film as an "enlightened gentleman," Yang Mingqian. After Yang Mingqian was killed by Song Jingpo, Yang Shufang immediately took over his uncle's position as the commander of the counter-revolutionary militia. Song Jingpo's period of activity was when Wu Xun was in his twenties, but he did not join Song Jingpo and instead joined Yang Shufang, thus choosing his counter-revolutionary path. According to the investigation by the Wu Xun Historical Research Team, the elderly peasants in the area still remember their revolutionary leaders of that time, and when they mention Song Jingpo, they are full of enthusiasm and talk about it with great interest, while when they mention Wu Xun, they show no interest and indifference. This can show the true feelings of the peasant class, their clear right and wrong, and their fervent love and hate. We do not know whether Zhou Da in the film is a reference to Song Jingpo, but in any case, Zhou Da in the film or the real person Song Jingpo and Wu Xun, apart from the irreconcilable hostile relationship between peasants and landlords, revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries, there can be no other relationship.

The film "The Story of Wu Xun" greatly slandered the peasant revolution. It distortedly depicted Zhou Da and the forces he led as merely burning and killing. Look at the following description and dialogue:

"'Hey, Wu Qi, come with us...' Zhou Da told Wu Xun. 'This world is not fit for people to live in! We can only kill! Kill all those evil officials and landlords!'"

"'Kill...' Wu Xun had heard from the elders' stories and legends, from Li Zicheng and his peasant followers forcing the Ming dynasty Chongzhen Emperor to hang himself on Coal Hill, to the peasant leader Wang Lun who once occupied the counties of Tangyi, Shouyang, and Yanggu, all ended in defeat. Hong Xiuquan established his capital in Nanjing five years ago, forgetting the poor people. It is said that in the past two years, he was defeated and captured, and Hunan and Jiangxi were all taken by Zeng Guofan's Hunan Army, and the situation was clearly hopeless... Kill, what use is it?'"

"'Can you kill them all? Kill a few evil landlords and that's it...' Wu Xun hesitated and said, 'Zhou Da, I still plan to beg for money to build a private school...'" (Film novel: "The Story of Wu Xun" pages 135-136.)

And when Wu Xun met Zhou Da for the last time, Wu Xun once again said, "Is it enough to just kill?... So many people, how can you kill them all?..." "Zhou Da's head involuntarily lowered. He frowned and said angrily, 'It's a pity that we don't have a good leader to lead us well. Hong Xiuquan sat on the throne in Nanjing and forgot about us poor people!'" (Ibid., pages 169-170)

This is not a correct historical criticism but precisely reveals the author's pessimistic and defeatist view and sentiment towards the peasant revolution. The Taiping Army and other peasant revolutions at that time, although ended in failure, were precisely the hundreds of peasant revolutionary wars in history that struck the rule of the feudal landlord class, changed the mutual relationships in society to some extent, and promoted the development of productive forces, thus improving the living conditions of the peasants to some extent. Comrade Mao Zedong highly evaluated the role of peasant wars in history, believing that "only such peasant uprisings and peasant wars are the true driving force of China's historical progress." ("Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party") Therefore, it is not possible to lower or even erase its great role in Chinese history because of the failure of peasant wars. The firm spirit and heroic courage shown by the Chinese peasants in their struggles against the feudal landlord class in each of the struggles deserve to be sung by future generations. At the end of the film, the author, through the mouth of the female teacher, gave such an overall evaluation of the peasant revolution: "Relying solely on the peasants' revenge psychology to eliminate tyrants and avenge themselves, they did not organize the broad masses." Thus, the great peasant revolutionary war was seen as nothing more than an unorganized, blind, individual act of revenge. This is a great slander against the Chinese peasant wars, isn't it?

Some people might say that in any case, the film exposed the contradictions between peasants and landlords and exposed the crimes of the feudal landlords represented by Zhang Juren. However, the author did not negate the feudal landlord rule as a social system that obstructs historical progress but, on the one hand, exposed the evil figures like Zhang Juren among the feudal landlords, while on the other hand, sang the praises of the equally evil reactionary landlord Yang Shufang and described him as a "highly respected" "wise gentleman"; another landlord, Guo Fen, was simply described as a fervent supporter of the interests of the peasants. Listen to his criticism of Zhang Juren: "Don't you forget: what you eat, drink, wear, and live in, are all taken from the peasants?" This is not the speech of a landlord but the language of a revolutionary propagandist! Strangely enough, his speech even won the applause of all the landlords present except Zhang Juren. The film described the effect of his speech as follows:

"The righteous voice of justice resonated through the hall like a great bell. Wu Xun, with his dim eyes, looked up at the young defender of justice."

"Wu Xun, who was sitting on the ground, listened to the sighs and applause in the hall, looked at the scene of donating land and money around him, excitement, gratitude, and surprise made him speechless. He was helped up, and two streams of hot tears flowed down his face like a spring..." (Film novel: "The Story of Wu Xun" pages 161-162)

What a song of praise for the landlord class! Since the author portrayed Wu Xun as a "standing firmly on the class position and fighting against the feudal rulers all his life" peasant hero, then, alas, this peasant hero was so small and humble in front of these landlords, so grateful for the kindness of the landlords! Here, the author is not exposing the landlords but singing their praises, not propagating the class struggle of the peasants against the landlords, but propagating the class cooperation of the peasants with the landlords. Isn't this quite clear?

The theme song of the film, "In Praise of Wu Xun," on the one hand, praises Wu Xun as an individual: "Great is Wu Xun, brave and kind"; on the other hand, it curses the times: "How thin is the world, the continent is sinking." Even if the author is cursing the past times, this curse is wrong. The so-called "world" is not unified, there is a "world" that maintains the order of feudal society, and there is a "world" that destroys the order of feudal society. Wu Xun received the unanimous favor of the feudal rulers from the Qing Emperor to the local officials and landlords, and his "private school" also received their praise and support, so, in terms of the relationship between the feudal ruling class and Wu Xun as an individual, this "world" is not thin. However, the vast majority of peasants did not support Wu Xun's cause. They despised Wu Xun's shameful and lowly behavior of bowing and scraping before the feudal rulers and, with their firm and unyielding struggle, powerfully impacted the foundation of the feudal social order. The great storm of peasant revolution in Wu Xun's time was precisely the "world" that destroyed the feudal social order. The reactionary rule of the Qing dynasty, representing several thousand years of feudal institutions, was facing its final death. Only those who observe problems from the standpoint of the peasants, not from the standpoint of the feudal landlords, from the standpoint of the people, not from the standpoint of the oppressors of the people, can have the idea and feeling of "How thin is the world, the continent is sinking." For an era of peasant revolution, let alone for today's era when the people's revolution has achieved historic victory, to have the lament of "How thin is the world, the continent is sinking" is precisely to reveal a sense of a declining class in the face of the progressive, revolutionary, and creative forces of history, to express nostalgia and longing for the old things and old thoughts that are dying or about to die, and hostility and fear towards the new things and new thoughts that are being born and growing. Following "How thin is the world, the continent is sinking," the next two lines are "Who enlightens my ignorance, who relieves my poverty," as if the one who can enlighten the peasants' awakening and change the poor condition of the peasants is only the "unique in a thousand years" Wu Xun, and not the peasants themselves rising up to struggle, changing their poor condition through the method of struggle, and gradually improving their awakening in the struggle. Thus, on the one hand, the praise of Wu Xun reached the goal of erasing, distorting, and slandering the peasant revolution on the other hand.

"The Hypocrisy and Ugliness of the 'Wu Xun' Image"

Wu Xun was originally one of the most despicable, hypocritical, and reactionary servants in feudal society. The film, however, wants to portray him as a figure who "typically represents the lofty qualities of diligence, bravery, and wisdom of our Chinese nation," which requires artistic embellishment and deception. However, art should always be a true reflection of reality; the power of art mainly lies in its truthfulness. Therefore, no matter how hard the author tries, he cannot cover up the hypocrisy and ugliness of the image of Wu Xun.

The film first portrays Wu Xun as a figure who is harmed and humiliated among the laboring people, a figure who is most likely to gain the sympathy of the general audience, especially the intellectual audience. The film creates the image of young Wu Xun: "So honest, shy, hardworking, and tall and thin," "a face half silly and half loyal." (The real Wu Xun was cunning, shameless, lazy, and a big man with a waist "as thick as a chopping board"). This honest young man was always bullied and cheated because he was too honest. But he had his own philosophy, that is, the author's so-called "optimistic and humorous view of life," which is actually the author's philosophy.

When Xiao Tao, a relatively likable character in the film, indignantly said to Wu Xun, "Why do you always do the dirtiest, heaviest, and most laborious work?" "Others see you as honest and push all the work onto you." Wu Xun replied, "The dirtiest, heaviest, and most laborious work must be done by someone!" He spoke like a compassionate Buddhist, "If I don't do it, who will?" (Film novel: "The Story of Wu Xun" page 66)

When Xiao Tao once again advised Wu Xun not to trust Zhang Juren and criticized him for being "too honest," Wu Xun replied, "But I do things with a good conscience..." The author here made an affirmative comment: "Honest people are always honest—who can say that people should not be honest?" (Ibid., page 73)

Thus, the author not only fabricated the picture of young Wu Xun's self-sacrificing labor but also beautified his slave-like attitude towards labor and blind loyalty to the feudal landlords, likening it to the compassionate heart of a Buddha, regarding it as a quality that a person should have. This is precisely the viewpoint and method used by landlord and bourgeois writers to describe laboring people.

The film depicts the scene of Wu Xun's first meeting with the landlord Zhang Juren: how Wu Xun, feeling ashamed of himself, hid his left foot, which was sticking out, behind his right foot, while brushing the dust off his tattered robe; how he stumbled and fell to the ground in surprise when he heard Money Mother call "Come here!" and mistook Money Mother for the mistress, kneeling down before her and calling "Madam"; and how he knelt down in fear when he heard Zhou Da call "Master," his knees trembling and his legs involuntarily kneeling. This may indeed be the true portrait of Wu Xun's youth, a born coward and servant. His so-called "begging to promote education" throughout his life fully displayed his servant-like nature and roguishness. The author, however, portrayed such a servant as a typical laboring person, a national hero, and sang his praises, which is intolerable to every patriotic viewer.

When the audience sees Wu Xun with a small braid on the left side of his head, a cloth bag on his shoulder, a copper bowl in his hand, muttering about private schools, bowing and kowtowing to people, especially when they see him kneeling on the ground, exposing his chest, and shouting, "Hit me once, two coins, kick me once, three coins," many patriotic viewers are indignant at this humiliating image of the laboring people and the Chinese nation. Even those who blindly worship Wu Xun cannot help but feel uneasy at this ugly and lowly image.

Zhao Dan, in his article "How I Portrayed Wu Xun," described his experience of creating the image of Wu Xun, which is quite interesting. They specially went to Shandong, Wu Xun's hometown, to collect materials. He found "a few so-called descendants or disciples of Wu Xun, one of whom even regarded himself as the second Wu Xun," but these people greatly disappointed Zhao Dan. He described his impression of them as follows: "This group of 'successors' of Wu Xun's cause made me feel disgusted and afraid, their vulgarity of chasing after fame and profit, using 'begging to promote education' as a cover, and not engaging in labor, almost losing even the most basic peasant smell. I felt that these figures would harm the true spirit of Wu Xun." Here, Zhao Dan found the key to understanding the "true spirit of Wu Xun," but he threw it far away, because he did not dare to face reality, to excavate history, his creative attitude was not based on reality but on subjective imagination. He completely deviated from the path of realism. He narrated that in that place, "I made three friends, one was a peasant, one was the younger son of the principal of Wu Xun Normal School, and one was a little donkey raised in the school." These three friends greatly helped the work of our artist's creation. He said: "All these seem to have nothing to do with Wu Xun, but from these simple, sincere, and kind images, and that kind of true goodness and love, I saw the shadow of Wu Xun." Dear author, when did you discover the "people's" image and that kind of "true goodness and love" from a little donkey? The laboring people in your eyes, the so-called "simplicity" and "sincerity" of laboring people that you often praise, is it like this? Small bourgeois and bourgeois artists are accustomed to "portraying" and "singing the praises" of laboring people in this way!

Therefore, although the film "The Story of Wu Xun" is a praise of Wu Xun, it still failed to create any likable image of Wu Xun.

So, what is it that makes the image of Wu Xun, who should have aroused the audience's hatred and contempt, actually arouse the sympathy and admiration of many viewers?

The key is not only that the author portrayed Wu Xun as a figure who is harmed and humiliated, always kneeling and begging for sympathy and pity, but more importantly, that he combined Wu Xun's humble behavior of kneeling and begging everywhere with his so-called "high ideal of promoting education for poor children" and his so-called "perseverance of thirty years like one day." Thus, a feudal servant's clownish jester becomes a tragic hero figure who resists feudal oppression with his own strength throughout his life, and thus easily wins the admiration and respect of many viewers, especially intellectual viewers.

To turn a clown into a hero, not only artistic ingenuity is needed, but also theoretical explanation. Listen to the philosophical discussion full of "philosophical" meaning by Mr. Sun Yu, the author of "The Story of Wu Xun":

"Making the world laugh—it is much better than making the world cry.

Thus, Wu Xun bravely chose a path within his own abilities, appearing in the streets of feudal society a hundred years ago in the guise of a clown, ready to accept any hardship and ridicule, wanting to resist with his personal tragic struggle, to fight for the poor, and to fight for the opportunity for the next generation of children to receive education. From his tearful smiling eyes, we see Wu Xun—the son of the laboring people—his sincere and boundless love for his fellow sufferers, the proletariat (??—quoted by the author)." (Film novel: "The Story of Wu Xun" page 115)

The film "The Story of Wu Xun" deliberately exaggerated his personal resistance tragedy, and in this tragedy, gave the greatest praise to personal struggle and individual heroism. He deliberately portrayed Wu Xun as an orphan who lost his father at the age of five and his mother at the age of seven, on the one hand, arousing the audience's sympathy for the fate of the orphan, and on the other hand, making him develop a lonely and strong character from a young age, and achieve amazing achievements when he grows up. He deliberately inserted a symbolic weathervane with such great significance in Wu Xun's life:

"Not falling down, not falling down,
Always smiling, always rushing,
Push it and it won't fall,
Throw it and it won't cry in pain."

It seems that Wu Xun is such a weathervane, he perseveres and unyieldingly struggles for his life to realize his ideal of "promoting education," falls down and gets up again. Promoting education becomes Wu Xun's "beautiful dream," "beautiful ideal." This "beautiful dream" and "ideal" are finally realized. Xiao Tao, who is the only character with a rebellious spirit in the film besides Zhou Da, but the author let her die so early. Her death is more due to her being a martyr for Wu Xun's ideal than due to the persecution of the feudal landlord class. She died wearing the red flower left by her mother. Her tragic death was beautified, thus greatly weakening the hatred for the feudal landlord system that would inevitably be aroused by her death.

"People can die happily for a beautiful ideal, or live hard for it," the author of "The Story of Wu Xun" wrote. Thus, Xiao Tao's tragic death and Wu Xun's humiliating life both found the most noble reason.

Wu Xun was thus portrayed as a lonely idealist. "He walked a very bitter and very long road." The image of a lonely man "shouldering a cloth bag, holding a copper bowl, slowly but firmly walking on the northern plains" solemnly and sacredly appeared before the audience, arousing the audience's, especially the small bourgeois intellectual audience's, emotion and admiration.

Zhao Dan was precisely following the scriptwriter's intention and his own personal mood to portray the character of Wu Xun. In the aforementioned article "How I Portrayed Wu Xun," he made a faithful confession of his mood:

"After being released from prison, life and work were seriously disconnected from the times, and at the same time, the rebelliousness of the young who were unwilling to submit was added, on the one hand, eager to return to the reality of struggle, on the other hand, did not know where to start (this is precisely the character of the small bourgeois intellectual). Based on these tangled and painful moods, I found this Mr. Wu Xun, like finding a bosom friend, a friend who has shared hardships, I felt I had reason to embrace him and cry aloud. At that time, I simply felt that only I could fully understand him... also only I knew the psychological pain and coldness of being misunderstood and ridiculed by others when a person foolishly fights for truth and justice... I felt lonely..."

Revolutionary small bourgeois intellectuals always show weakness when they are not united with the masses. At the critical moments of the advancement or retreat of the revolutionary situation, they often feel confused, they are aware of the distance between themselves and the times and the people and feel lonely and isolated, they complain that others do not understand them, as if they have countless grievances in their hearts, and even feel that the revolution is only a foolish thing to do. When they feel their own weakness, they need a force to support them. Either from the communist worldview, from the actual struggle of the masses, to draw strength; this strength is boundless; or from individualist philosophy and personal struggle to seek help and encouragement, which will lead people to the path of separating from the masses and opposing the masses. The film "The Story of Wu Xun" points out to the audience through Wu Xun, precisely such a path.

The film "The Story of Wu Xun" slandered the historical path of the Chinese people, propagated the reactionary thoughts of the bourgeoisie, used reformism to replace revolution, used personal struggle to replace mass struggle, and used the surrenderism of bowing and scraping to replace revolutionary heroism. The image of Wu Xun in the film is ugly and hypocritical, reflecting the darkness and baseness of our feudal society, praising him is praising darkness and baseness, is anti-people, and anti-patriotic.

The errors of the film "The Story of Wu Xun" are serious. Mr. Sun Yu should have the courage to admit and expose this error and correct this error in his future artistic actions. This is the minimum responsibility that a true people's artist should have to the people.

Note: All quoted sentences in this article that are not marked or explained as to their source are quoted from Sun Yu's film novel "The Story of Wu Xun." The film "The Story of Wu Xun" and the film novel are consistent, but the novel contains many descriptions and discussions that are impossible for the film, which are more helpful in understanding the author's thoughts.

　　反人民、反历史的思想和反现实主义的艺术  电影《武训传》批判
    周扬
    五月二十日《人民日报》社论《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》的发表，引起了全国文艺界、教育界、社会科学界和一般知识界关于武训和电影《武训传》的广泛的热烈的讨论。这是一场十分严重的思想论争。因为论争的中心问题关涉到中国人民的历史的道路：中国人民所走的是革命的道路呢，还是改良主义、投降主义的道路？这是一个带有重大原则性质，必须正确地加以解答的问题。
    两个月来，许多同志对电影《武训传》、《武训画传》及其它一切关于武训的反动宣传进行了严正的批判。最近发表的《武训历史调查记》以无可辩驳的逻辑的力量作出了关于武训问题的科学结论，并且在历史研究工作、社会调查工作和文艺批评工作的方法上做了很好的示范。我自己很早就看了电影《武训传》，但并没有能够充分地认识和及早地指出它的严重的政治上的反动性。虽然我在三月间举行的第一届全国文化行政会议上对这电影作了批评，但现在看了许多同志的文章和材料之后，感觉着我当时的批评是极其不够的。现在，武训的历史已经完全清楚了；但对于引起这次论争的电影《武训传》本身，却还需要就它的思想和艺术作系统的批判。我的这篇文章就是为这个目的写的。
            两种历史观
    电影《武训传》是一部关涉中国近代历史的传记影片。对待历史有两种不同的观点。
    一种观点认为：历史不是由阶级和阶级斗争造成的，而是由少数所谓先知先觉者造成的；社会的黑暗不是由于不合理制度的存在，而是由于人民自己没有教育，没有文化，因此要改造社会，可以无需经过人民群众的革命斗争，推翻旧制度，建立新制度，只需给人民以教育和文化，就可以达到新的光明的世界。因此历史的创造者和推动者，主要地不是劳动人民，而是有文化教养的人们以及热心于在人民中传播“教育”“文化”的人们。这是一种反人民、反科学的历史观点。宣传这种观点就是在思想上解除群众的武装，散布幻想，叫群众发生一种错觉，以为在旧社会的制度下不经过群众的革命的方法而经过某些改良的方法就可以使他们的生活状况获得根本的改善。孙瑜在电影《武训传》中就是用艺术的手段巧妙地宣传了这种思想。他把武训的“兴学”描写为劳动人民求解放的最可靠的道路。于是他就把武训——这个封建社会中最丑恶、最虚伪、最反动的奴才，这个腐烂的封建文化的狂热宣传者——描写为“向封建统治者作了一生一世的斗争”的坚韧的革命战士，不，简直描写为一个神圣化了的人物：他“在云端向下界微笑，给正得着解放的本阶级劳动同伴们祝福”呢。就这样，这个历史上的反动派就成了中国人民的革命祖先，而解放了的中国人民就成了武训事业的继承者。这对于具有光荣革命传统，今天正站在全世界反帝国主义斗争的最前线英勇地、坚决地战斗着的中国人民，难道不是绝大的污蔑吗？这种污蔑难道是难够容忍的吗？
    另一种与上述观点完全对立的观点，认为：人类社会的基础既然是由生产组成的，那末人类社会历史的创造者，首先就是生产物质财富的劳动人民。劳动人民在他们每天创造物质财富的当年，不断地创造历史。特别在历史的转变关头，当新的社会力量起来和旧的社会力量进行斗争的时候，决定斗争的结局的总是广大的人民群众。人民群众是历史的主要推动者。历史上的每一个重大的进步或变革都必须经过人民群众的严重斗争，而不是单靠少数所谓先知先觉者所能完成的。任何英雄好汉，只有当他正确地代表了历史的前进方向，代表了或至少在某些重要方面代表了广大人民的意志和利益的时候，才能成为真正的英雄好汉。如果违背了历史的前进方向，违背了广大人民的意志和利益，不管他具有怎样的个人品质，怎样的才能、毅力，甚至有怎样的“奇行特操”，都只能成为可怜可笑的人物，最后终将被抛入历史的垃圾箱中去。只有根据这种观点来衡量和估价历史人物，这才是正确的。因此，我们的文学艺术，只能歌颂那些推动历史前进，对人民有贡献的人物，而决不应歌颂历史上的反动派，或对人民毫无贡献的人物。我们特别尊重自己民族的革命传统，我们要把人民今天的斗争和过去的革命传统正确地连结起来，因此我们决不能容忍对人民革命传统的任何歪曲或侮蔑。许多同志批评电影《武训传》及其它关于武训的错误文章，主要地就都是从这个根本点出发的。这是人民的、科学的历史观点。
    人民的、科学的历史观点和反人民、反科学的历史观点，这就是马克思列宁主义思想和资产阶级反动思想的区别。
    许多小资产阶级知识分子徘徊在两者之间，他们虽承认人民群众的革命斗争在历史上的作用，但对这种作用的认识往往是抽象的，估计往往是不足的。又由于他们个人的出身和教养，他们在解释具体历史现象或社会现象的时候，往往就自觉或不自觉地把文化看得高于一切，把个人的力量看得高于群众的力量，而特别有兴趣于个人的奋斗和成就，甚至个别的所谓“奇人奇事”。这和中国工业不发达，小生产占绝对优势，小资产阶级众多，文化落后的状况是有很大关系的。这些小资产阶级知识分子就形成了武训和电影《武训传》的盲目赞扬者的社会基础。他们的盲目赞扬武训和《武训传》，一方面固然是由于受了关于武训的反动宣传的欺骗，另一方面也正是因为这种反动宣传恰好乘了他们缺乏历史观点和缺乏群众观点的弱点，投合了他们的知识分子的个人主义的思想、情绪和心理。这就是为什么在武训的真面目已经被揭露之后，还有一些人要找各种理由为武训辩护，有些人甚至在理性上否定了武训，在感情上还是同情他。
    那末，究竟武训和电影《武训传》有些什么地方那么迷惑人呢？
            武训和电影《武训传》迷惑人的地方在哪里？
    武训并不是历史上的什么重要人物，他不过是反动的封建统治者的各色各样的奴才之一，但他却是其中的一个比较特殊的、带有特别的虚伪性和欺骗性的奴才。电影《武训传》就以历史的伪造和艺术的渲染把他描画成一个革命人物和民族英雄。于是一具封建僵尸穿上了革命的衣服大摇大摆地走进人民的行列，在人民当中散布毒素。因此我们要批判电影《武训传》，首先就必须揭露武训的真实面目。许多批评者从各方面进行了这个揭露的工作，而武训历史调查团则更作了一个关于武训的全面的、彻底的揭露。
    武训和电影《武训传》有它迷惑人的地方。自然，许多人被迷惑，还不只是因为对武训历史真相不明了的原故，而主要的，是由于缺乏以马列主义观点辨别事物的能力。
    武训出身贫农，从乞丐变为高利贷者兼地主，他一生的历史，基本上就是一个寄生者、剥削者的历史。根据武训历史调查团的调查，在武训的整个一生中，他只有过一年多时间的劳动，而且他所从事的又只是一些铡草、推磨之类的比较轻微的劳动，而不是生产中的主要劳动。在他的行乞生活中虽然有时也仍做些铡草、推磨的工作，但那已不过是他行乞生活中的一种点缀，或者如同他的变戏法一样，是行乞的一种节目而已。他事实上已经完全脱出了农民阶级的轨道，而成为了一个职业的乞丐，并且是一个耍着各种无赖手段的恶丐。电影《武训传》却把他描写为劳动人民的忠实的儿子，特别强调他的终生劳动，说他“除去在破庙里睡着了的时间以外，他的两手从不休息”，这样就把他的生活的堕落的寄生的性质掩盖起来了。但是如果我们用科学的、阶级的观点观察问题的话，那末，乞丐所属的游民阶层是和工人农民真正劳动阶级不相干的。游民是寄生者，又具有很大的破坏性，他们很容易变成为反革命的工具，这是马克思、恩格斯在一百多年以前写的《共产党宣言》中就讲了的。事实上历来反动统治者也总是从游民阶层中去物色、培养和提拔他的走狗的。武训的历史道路，也恰巧证明了这条真理。武训不是一个普通乞丐，而是一个打着“兴学”旗帜的政治乞丐。他有了这个旗帜，不但行乞方便得多，而更重要的是找着了和封建统治阶级通气的门路。他果然得到了豪绅地主官吏的赞助和支持，使他办起了所谓“义学”，他自己也成为了地主兼高利贷者。但他和普通地主是不一样的。他虽然已经是一个三百多亩土地的所有者，而且以超过当时最高标准的利率放债，但是他的土地名义上是学田，而他的收租放债又都假“兴学”之名以行，因而就在世人眼中掩盖了他地主兼高利贷者的剥削者的身份。封建地主原是各式各样的：有庙田所有者的宗教地主，与武训合作办第二所“义学”的了证和尚就属于这一类地主；也有学田及其它公田所有者的政治地主，武训就是这样的一个政治地主。武训打着“兴学”旗帜，凭仗着地主豪绅官僚的势力，占有了大量的土地和高利贷资本，放肆地对农民进行无情的残酷的剥削。当地的贫苦农民叫武训为“财迷”。武训的剥削行为，就在赞扬他的许多传记里，也不能不透露一些出来，但在电影里却完全被掩盖了。武训对家庭所表示的态度：“我的事，你别管，兄弟分家不相干”，“不顾亲，不顾故”，“亲戚朋友断个净”，并不是如一些武训赞扬者所说的那样，表现了武训在亲属关系上的大公无私，而恰是表现了作为地主兼高利贷者的武训在对农民（包括他自己的亲兄弟在内）的剥削关系上的冷酷和坚决。这可以看做是武训背叛他所出身的农民阶级而投降地主阶级的决心书。从此，武训交上了娄峻岭、杨树坊、施善政之流的大豪绅地主恶霸，而成为了他们的座上宾。
    武训的利害还在于他虽然成了地主兼高利贷者，却始终穿着乞丐的衣服，并在行乞与强化布施中继续使用各种无赖的手段，他成为一个穿着乞丐衣服的流氓政治地主。因为如果脱下这衣服，他的欺骗作用就要失去，至少要大大地减少了。但是如果我们在确定一个人的阶级成份的时候，不根据一个人表面的生活形态，而只根据他对生产资料的占有关系的话，那末，对于武训的鉴定除了他是地主兼高利贷者这个结论之外，就不能再有任何其它的结论了。
    武训的更迷惑人的地方，是他的“兴学”的事迹。武训的“兴学”，加上他的印发善书，奖励节孝等等，本来完全是宣传最反动的腐朽的封建文化和封建道德，死心塌地地为封建地主阶级服务的；但是电影《武训传》却把他的“兴学”描写成反对封建地主统治，为农民求解放的义举。武训被描写成了“脑筋一点也不封建”，而且“坚韧地、百折不挠地和封建统治者作了一生一世的斗争”的革命英雄。这是一个绝大的诳骗。“兴学”的口号是能够骗人的，不但在武训生前，而且就在他死后的今天，这个口号还有迷惑人的力量。
    “办教育总是好事”，许多武训的拥护者和同情者这样说，好像否定武训就是轻视教育似的。我们应当重视教育，但不应当把教育看成超阶级、超政治的。斯大林同志在《与英国作家威尔斯的谈话》中，有一段话说得非常好：
    “教育是一种武器，其效能是依谁把它掌握在自己手中，用这个武器去打击谁为转移的。当然，无产阶级、社会主义是需要受过高等教育的人的。很明显的，只要不是最愚蠢的人，都可以帮助无产阶级去争取社会主义，建立新社会。我并不轻视知识分子的作用，相反的，我更侧重他们的作用。问题只在于说的是那一种知识分子，因为知识分子是各色各样的。”
    事实很清楚，武训所办的“义学”是完全掌握在封建地主手中的。兴办“义学”，并不是武训的什么创举。早在清初的时候，封建统治者就在各地办了许多“义学”。那位一只手血淋淋地镇压农民革命，另一只手提拔武训的山东巡抚张曜就是“义学”的积极提倡者。那末这种所谓“义学”，究竟是“打击谁”，是打击地主，还是打击农民的呢，由这种“义学”所培养出来的知识分子，究竟是拥护农民利益的，还是拥护地主利益的呢，难道不是一眼可以判断出来的吗？武训自己也唱了：“坏人多，好人少，办个义学错不了。”武训的“兴学”就正是迎合了当时封建统治者笼络人心的反动政策，因而“义学”就成了他投降封建统治阶级并使自己也爬上地主阶级行列中去的政治资本。
    “在封建社会里，只能办封建教育，不能苛责武训。”武训的拥护者和同情者又这样拥护着说，好像否定武训就是否定一切过去时代的教育似的。
    我们并不一般地否定封建社会、资本主义社会的教育，并且承认教育在各个历史时代中的一定作用，而新教育又正是从旧教育发展来的。在这一点上，我们不但要将武训和陶行知相区别，而且也要将武训和孔子相区别。陶行知的道路是从一个资产阶级改良主义者发展为革命的民主主义者的道路，他的教育学说中有不少观念论的因素，这是他的思想上的弱点。他错误地赞扬武训就正是他的这种思想上的弱点的表现之一。但就他整个的政治倾向和他在晚年努力使他的教育活动的内容革命化的事实来说，他无疑地是中国人民的杰出的教育家之一。武训是不能和他相提并论的。孔子是封建社会的伟大的教育家；他与武训不同，不只因为他生在二千多年前正当封建制度兴盛，封建文化放出灿烂异彩的时代，而武训所处的时代，则是封建统治基础已面临最后崩溃，而作为这个基础的上层建筑物的封建文化已腐烂到丧失任何生命力的时代；而且也因为孔子在教育思想和教育方法上有卓越的贡献，而武训则不过是以“兴学”做幌子，对教育一无所知、一无所能的一个骗子而已。有些教育工作者把武训这样一个人物放在教育史上和陶行知、孔子并列，甚至高过陶行知、孔子的地位，这实在是教育界的一件耻辱的事情。
    “武训为穷孩子‘兴学’，他的动机总是好的。”这是为武训辩护的一个最普遍、最动听的理由了。电影《武训传》就肆意渲染了武训为着穷孩子的一片苦心。
    武训的动机是否真是为穷孩子“兴学”，这就不能单单根据武训所打出的“兴个义学为贫寒”的招牌，而要具体考察武训所办的“义学”的实际内容和效果。
    本来，武训的“义学”，不论是从经费来源、教学内容，学生成份来说，都是一开始就完全掌握在地主阶级手中的。电影《武训传》却偏偏要说成是在武训死后才被地主们抢过去的。武训的兴学本来是以“又有名，又行好，文昌帝君知道了，准教你子子孙孙坐八抬大轿。”为号召的，电影却捏造一些这样相反的场面：武训听到学生读“学而优则仕”，他的内心那样地感到彷徨和痛苦；他流着泪再三叮咛他的学生：“你们念好了书，千万不能忘记咱们穷人！”最后他又那样充满信心地说：“我不能休息！不等到每一个穷孩子都有书念，都有饭吃的时候……我是不会休息的。”这一切描写无非是要叫观众相信，不管“义学”的客观效果如何，武训的一颗赤热的心始终是为穷孩子的，为着农民的。事实真是这样吗？只消举出一个材料就可以解答这个问题了。据武训历史调查团的调查，武训所办的第一所学校“崇贤义塾”，头七年，根本没有蒙学，只有经班，而经班的学生全都是地主富农商人子弟，贫苦农民子弟是入不了经班的。武训的心如果真是为穷孩子，那末，七年之久，他的学校中没有穷孩子，他难道看不见吗？很显然，他的心中是根本没有什么穷孩子的地位的。
    动机本来是主观存在的东西，只有当一个人的主观动机变为行动而发生客观效果的时候，我们才能有根据和可能检验他的动机。正如毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中所说的，“社会实践是检验主观愿望的标准，效果是检验动机的标准。”而效果的好坏则是以对人民有利或有害为标准的。为人民的动机与有利于人民的效果，必须统一起来。一个人的动机如果真是全心全意为人民服务的，那末，他就必然对自己所做的事情采取对人民十分负责的态度，而一当他发现自己所做的任何一件事情于人民不利的时候，他就立刻加以改正。一个人能否揭露并改正自己的错误缺点，这是检验他的动机是否真好的最重要的标准。批评与自我批评，就是使为人民的动机与有利于人民的效果统一起来的最可靠的良好的方法。凡是观察事情不从唯物的、群众的观点出发而从唯心的、个人的观点出发的人，总是喜欢片面地强调动机，而忽视效果。凡是不愿或不肯认真地实行批评与自我批评的人又总是喜欢拿“动机”来做挡箭牌。
    电影《武训传》及一切武训宣传者都特别歌颂了武训的精神，什么“三十年如一日”啦，“忘我精神”啦，“毅力”啦，“苦行”啦，在电影《武训传》中，更把武训的精神和马列主义者所主张的“为人民服务”的伟大思想混同起来。从这里，就产生了电影《武训传》的最迷惑人的效果。
    人们同情着和赞叹着武训的苦行。但是只要稍稍分析一下，就可看出他的苦行只不过是变戏法的讹诈手段（如吃五毒、吃瓦片、喝脏水等）和磕头下跪的奴隶行为的混合罢了，至于吃粗粮、宿破庙、不娶妻等等，姑无论武训的实际行为是否如此，这些事实本身又算得了什么苦行呢？如果这些都叫苦行，那么全国千千万万劳动人民不是更大的苦行者吗？
    马列主义者是反对个人苦行的，这不只是因为苦行违反人的生活的自然规律，而且更重要的是这种个人苦行不但不能解除或减轻群众的苦难，反而加深群众的苦难。被压迫、被剥削的劳动群众每天过着痛苦的生活，他们苦得够了，不再需要什么苦行，他们所渴望的是及早地尽可能地解除或减轻自己的痛苦。只有少数吃饱了饭，活得无聊的人才提倡苦行，从别人受苦中寻找自己的快乐。只有反动的艺术家，才把被压迫人类的痛苦加以美化。
    不错，我们从来提倡艰苦奋斗的作风。但我们决不是为吃苦而吃苦，更不是以自苦为乐，而是为了要把全世界受苦的人们解放出来，引导他们到幸福的生活去，这样一个伟大的崇高的目的；正是被这个目的所鼓舞，我们才能够经受得起一切痛苦和磨难的考验，直至牺牲自己的生命。这种艰苦奋斗是跟任何不敢反抗不敢革命不敢牺牲生命的所谓“苦行”完全不同或完全相反的。正是因为这样，古今中外的反动统治者既不宣传整个劳动人民的痛苦，更不宣传革命家的牺牲，却愿意宣传那种对统治者无害因而统治者也无须去加害的以“苦行”招摇的个人。不少知识分子由于没有经历过群众斗争的大世面，群众斗争的大风雨，总是不能完全体味群众苦难的深沉和群众斗争的伟大，而只醉心于各式各样的个人的苦行及其成功，他们不知道任何个人脱离群众就要成为没有力量的，也不可能有任何真正的成就。
    电影《武训传》特别强调武训具有鲁迅所说的“俯首甘为孺子牛”的精神。孙瑜在《编导〈武训传〉前后》一文中说：“鲁迅先生的这一名言自始至终地都写在我的剧本上。”但是在事实上，武训并没有向劳动人民俯首，更没有成为劳动人民的“牛”，相反，他只是要求“孺子甘为俯首牛”，向地主阶级俯首，也向武训本人俯首。而且，鲁迅的诗是两句，他的上句是“横眉冷对千夫指”，孙瑜却故意隐瞒了。对人民，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后己；对人民的敌人，即使是最凶恶的敌人，决不低头。这就是鲁迅的这两句名诗的不可分的含义。也就是毛泽东同志所说的：“对己要和，对敌要狠。”只有两方面结合起来，才能成为革命者，才是“为人民服务”的正确的完整的观念。武训宣传者，把“为人民服务”的口号庸俗化了，割掉了它的阶级的革命的内容。“为人民服务”，第一，不是空洞的口号，而是有具体阶级内容的，充满战斗性的口号。不能笼统地来看人民，而必须分析人民这一概念中是包含了几个阶级的；为人民服务，就必须首先为工农群众服务，因为他们构成人民中的最大多数；他们是生产者，而工人又是人类历史上最先进的阶级。第二，为人民服务，必须对人民的各种敌人进行坚决的斗争，帮助人民打倒压在他们头上的反动派，清除反动派在人民中间所散布的影响。毛泽东同志这样地描写着鲁迅的性格：“鲁迅的骨头是最硬的，他没有丝毫的奴颜与媚骨，这是殖民地半殖民地人民最可宝贵的性格。”在《论人民民主专政》中，毛泽东同志又这样描写了一个真正革命者所应当具备的气概：“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦，我们要学景阳岗上的武松。”我们所需要的就是鲁迅式的顽强性格，武松景阳冈打虎的勇敢精神。任何场合，我们都是反对对敌人磕头的；那是一种下贱的、奴隶式的叛徒的行为。“为人民服务”的战斗的口号必须和资产阶级的虚伪的服务精神区别开来。
    为历来武训宣传者们所颂扬的武训一生的主要事迹，就是“行乞”“兴学”和“苦行”，电影《武训传》就把这些本来是落后的，反动的，但尚能迷惑的人事迹再加上一层更迷惑人的、前进的革命的外衣，于是“行乞”变成劳动，“兴学”变成对封建统治者的反抗斗争，“苦行”变成“全心全意为人民服务”的榜样。把武训这样地理想化了之后，孙瑜先生还说他对武训是用“批判的眼光”来描写的，他把历史的修改说成历史的批判；把对武训的巧妙的歌颂说成批评。他在《编导〈武训传〉前后》一文中说：“除了歌颂武训的忘我精神以作服务人民的榜样之外，影片里批评了他的改良主义和个人英雄主义的作风。”既然是“个人英雄主义”，为什么又有可以作服务人民的榜样的“忘我精神”呢？这两者难道可以并存，可以相通吗？作者在这段话里如果不是说了双层的假话就是陷进了双重的错误：第一，武训所走的并不是什么改良主义和个人英雄主义的道路，而是十足的投降主义和奴才主义的道路；第二，作者在影片中并没有批评改良主义和个人英雄主义，而是恰恰相反借武训的所谓“行乞兴学”的事迹大大地鼓吹了落后的、反动的社会改良主义和个人英雄主义。《武训传》电影主题的反动性主要也就在这里。
            电影《武训传》主题的反动性
    关于武训的反动宣传都是有它历史的、社会的根源的。
    反动统治者，从满清王朝到蒋介石，他们如出一辙地先后表扬武训，是不足为怪的，因为武训正是适合维护他们的反动统治的一个有用的工具。值得注意的是，他们的褒扬武训，都是在他们感到自己的统治摇摇欲坠的时候。满清朝廷准给武训“乐善好施”字样，作为旌奖，是在一八八八年，正当太平天国之后二十四年，辛亥革命之前二十三年，那时封建秩序遭受了农民大革命浪潮的冲击，正迅速地开始瓦解，而农民大革命正成了迎接历史新时代的先声。国民党反动派在一九三四年发动武训九十七周诞辰纪念的运动，蒋介石特为从当时反革命军事中心地的南昌行营给武训纪念题字，以及一九三八年国民党反动政府由林森、孔祥熙、何键、陈立夫会签正式颁布褒扬武训的命令，正是在全国人民走向抗日高潮，人民革命力量经过曲折向前发展的时候。这说明了：反动统治者到了自己快要灭亡的时候，就好像一个人掉在水里一样，抓住一切浮在水上、能够抓到手的东西来挽救自己的覆没，武训就是在农民革命浪潮中卷起的渣滓而被反动统治者当作宝贝抓住的。
    现在中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，以自己英勇的、顽强的、坚决的斗争推翻了内外压迫者，为历来反动统治阶级所表扬的武训在新中国人民中应当再没有他的地位了。为什么关于武训的宣传不但没有敛迹，反而盛行起来呢？这就是资产阶级的反动思想的表现，这些思想在今天中国还有它的市场。国民党反动统治时期，资产阶级一方面不满意这个统治的专横残暴，另一方面，又不相信并且害怕群众的力量，因此就不敢向反动统治阶级坚决地进行斗争，而时常企图寻找一个可以不经过斗争而得到改良的局面。
    陶行知晚年成为了一个革命的民主派，但在提倡武训这件事情上面却表现了他早年的改良主义思想的影响；表现了他在反对国民党反动派的斗争中的脆弱的一面。
    在中国人民取得了全国性胜利之后，资产阶级参加了人民民主政权，但他们中间却仍有一部分人对于已经或正在死亡的旧制度、旧事物时常感到惋惜和留恋，而对于新生的事物表示冷淡和怀疑，对于人民革命更深入的发展则流露出彷徨恐惧的情绪。正如毛泽东同志在《人民民主专政》中所说的：“民族资产阶级的社会经济地位规定了他们的软弱性，他们缺乏远见，缺乏足够的勇气，并且有不少人害怕民众。”中国工人阶级的先锋队——共产党就有一种特别的责任，必须和资产阶级破坏或妨碍人民民主专政的各种反动的错误的思想进行严肃的、坚决的斗争，肃清其在人民内部，特别是在人民的先进分子中，共产党员中的影响。在每个比较严重的政治斗争中，必须反对各式各样的改良主义投降主义的思想，否则斗争就不能胜利前进。在抗美援朝运动中，我们首先反对了亲美、恐美、崇美的思想；土地改革中首先反对了“和平分田”的思想；镇压反革命运动中，首先反对了“宽大无边”的思想。
    电影《武训传》就是资产阶级的反动的改良主义思想在艺术上的表现之一。
    电影借武训的所谓“行乞兴学”的事迹用艺术的力量宣传了这样的改良主义的思想：不触动旧的社会经济基础，不破坏旧的政治制度，只要在人民中普及文化教育，就可以根本改变人民的被压迫的地位。既然人民只要有了文化就能解放，那自然就用不着群众的革命武装斗争了。
    电影中花了一千尺以上胶片来表现的武训做梦的场面（孙瑜电影小说《武训传》中的所谓《狂想三部曲》）正是表现了作者的主题思想的。
    作者在这幻梦和狂想中，描绘着人类社会的历史：
    “呻吟辗转在脚底、在长鞭的尖端，流汗、流血的是万千的农民……像牛像马在染血的重枷铁链下沉重的拉着犁，推着磨……”
    “巨磨张着大嘴吞噬着无数的生命……血流成了红河；骨肉压榨成粘滞的酱……劳苦的人群世世代代地永远转不出那黑暗痛苦的轮回……张举人的狞笑，忽然间把巨磨变成大石砚，黑墨磨动时溅出毒汁，飞洒在大群‘文盲’的眼睛里……”
    “男、女、老的、小的……伸着手，扶着杖，用力睁着他们的看不见事物的双眼，在人的‘奈何桥’上战战兢兢地摸索着走，左边是陡削的悬崖，右边是无底的深渊，后面有张举人拿着尖刀的笔；赵熊、魏俊披头散发，举起大笔和巨墨在驱赶，前面的独木桥下刮起阵阵的阴风和凄厉的哀号……。”
    “‘你们这些不识字的畜生，’举人魔鬼在笑喊，‘你们这些睁眼瞎子！我把你们都打下苦海，叫你们永世不能翻身！哈哈……’”（电影小说：《武训传》一○一页）
    原来，农民的痛苦生活并不是由于封建地主阶级在政治上经济上对他们的压迫和剥削的结果，而只是由于农民被地主阶级剥夺了受教育的权利，农民自己没有文化，不识字，他们的眼睛“看不见事物”。那末有什么办法“翻身”呢？就只有“学文化”了。
    当武训在梦中听到义学的时候，他狂喜得大叫起来：“这不是从地底飞上了天吗？……”他举臂高呼：“穷孩子们，快跟我念书去！”武训从这个快乐的梦中惊醒，张目四望，就“好像来到了一个新的光明的世界。”不识字的，活该入地狱，念了书可以上天堂。这就是电影《武训传》的中心思想。“念了书才可以多知道世上的事情；才可以找着过好日子的道路。……”这一段被作者形容为“包含着渊博的智慧”的老师的言语，难道不正是作者自己心中的言语，作者自己的思想吗？
    这种思想倒也不是什么新奇的东西。
    列宁早在一九二三年所写的《论我国革命》的一文中，就在关于文化与革命的关系问题上，严厉地批评了当时第二国际的社会民主党人，那些“怯懦畏缩的改良主义者”的老爷们，他们死咬着实行社会主义一定要先有相当文化水平，列宁尖锐地反驳说：为什么不能首先用革命手段造成这个相当文化水平的必要前提，即首先驱逐地主和驱逐俄国资本家，然后向社会主义前进呢？他在同一年所写的有名的《论合作制》一文中，也说在革命以前，工作重心只能放在政治斗争、革命和夺取政权上面，而只有在革命以后，工作重心才能移到和平的广泛的文化建设的事业上来。当然列宁是正确的。俄国革命的历史经验完全证实了他的预言。
    毛泽东同志在一九二七年所写的有名的《湖南农民运动考察报告》中也说过：
    “中国历来只是地主有文化，农民没有文化。可是地主的文化是由农民造成的，因为造成地主文化的东西，不是别的，正是从农民身上掠取的血汗。中国有百分之九十未受文化教育的人民，这个里面，最大多数是农民。农村里地主势力一倒，农民的文化运动便开始了。……农民运动发展的结果，农民的文化程度迅速地提高了。不久的时间内，全省当有几万所学校在乡村中涌出来，不若知识阶级和所谓‘教育家’者流，空唤‘普及教育’，唤来唤去还是一句废话。”
    当然毛泽东同志是正确的，中国革命的历史经验完全证实了他的预言。
    中国革命的经验就是这样的：首先发动农民武装斗争，在广大农村中推翻反动统治，建立革命根据地；然后在这个根据地上面逐步地发展人民的经济和文化。现在，由于中国人民的全国性的胜利，特别是土地改革在全国实行，农民的文化获得了历史上从来未有的迅速的广大的发展。可以断定：在不久的将来，正如毛泽东同志《在中国人民政协第一届全体会议上的开幕词》中所预言的，“我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界”。
    这是很有意思的事情：一个在历史上曾经比欧洲其它资本主义先进国家文化落后，文盲众多的沙皇俄国和一个在古代有过灿烂的文化，但在近代落伍了，文化落后，文盲特别众多的中国，正是西方和东方的这两个国家，首先取得了革命的大胜利。苏联现在不但成了世界上文化最发达的国家，而且正站在全人类文化的最高峰，指引世界人民前进的方向；新中国的新的人民的文化正在突飞猛进之中。道理是很简单的：社会主义革命和人民革命创造了人民文化无限发展的前提。
    不错，孙瑜先生在《我怎样表现武训的〈梦〉》一文中说了：“单凭念书而不革命，不夺取政权，穷人受压迫的命运是无法改变的。”但是，第一，一个艺术家的口头上的表白，和他在艺术作品中所实际表现的有时并不完全是一回事，而且在作品中所表现出来的往往是作者的更真实的思想和情感，读者又是只能从作品出发来判断作者的；第二，社会民主党也好，资产阶级的改良主义者也好，他们一般地在口头上都不否定革命，他们倒是装出十分爱护革命的样子，他们说群众要革命，先要有文化，这样从实际上来否定革命。电影《武训传》，正是宣传了这种错误思想。
    电影《武训传》写了以武训为代表的“义学”运动，同时也写了以周大为代表的农民革命，用作者的话，叫做“一武一文”，互相配合。但是这不但没有能够挽救，而且更加深了电影《武训传》主题思想的错误。武训和周大之间的友谊是一种完全违反历史事实的捏造，因为很显然地，反动派和革命派之间是不可能建立那样的友谊和事业上的合作关系的。作者在这里不过是以周大作武训的反衬，以夸大农民武装斗争的失败的和弱点的一面，来衬托出武训精神的伟大和他的兴学事业的至少某种程度上的成功。这样，就使电影《武训传》主题的反动性更加明显了。
    武训生长在中国农民革命浪潮起伏的时期；山东多年都是捻军活动的主要地区之一，就在他所出生的山东堂邑就有过农民武装起义。一八六○年，在堂邑柳林镇距武训的村子武庄不过七里地的另一个叫做小刘贯庄的村子里，爆发了以著名的宋景诗为首的农民起义。距武庄五里地的柳林镇则是地主反革命武装的堡垒。柳林的民团是最凶恶、最顽固的；团长不是别人、正是支持武训办成第一所义学、在电影中被描写为“开明士绅”的柳林地主杨树坊的叔父杨鸣谦，杨鸣谦被宋景诗打死后不久，就由杨树坊继承了他叔父的这个反革命的民团团长的职务。宋景诗活动的期间，正当武训二十多岁的时候，他没有投奔宋景诗，却投奔了杨树坊，他就这样选择了他的反革命的道路。据武训历史调查团的调查，当地年老农民至今怀念着他们当年革命的领袖，一提起宋景诗便眉飞色舞，讲得津津有味，而一提到武训，便表示没有兴趣和冷淡。这就可以看出农民阶级的真实感情，他们的明确的是非和热烈的爱憎。我们当然不知道电影中的周大是否影射宋景诗，但是，无论如何，电影中的周大或实有其人的宋景诗和武训之间，除了农民和地主、革命和反革命之间的不可调和的敌对的关系之外，是不可能再有任何其它的关系的。
    电影《武训传》对农民革命给与了极大的污蔑。它把周大和他所领导的队伍歪曲地描写为只是烧杀。请看下面的叙述和对话：
    “‘呃，武七，跟咱们一块走吧！……’周大告诉武训。‘这种世道不是人活得下去的！咱们就只有杀！杀尽那些狗官恶霸！’”
    “‘杀？……’武训所听过的父老传说和故事中，从李闯王和他手下的农民逼得明末崇祯皇帝上吊煤山，到八十年前一度占领过堂邑、寿张、阳谷等县城的山东贫民首领王伦都是一败涂地。洪秀全五年前建都南京，忘记了穷人。听说这两年败的败，擒的擒，两湖和江西全入了曾国藩湘军手里，眼看大势已去……杀，又有多大的用处？”
    “‘杀得完吗？杀几个恶霸说行了……’武训迟疑地说：‘周大爷，我还是打算讨饭积钱修义学……’”（电影小说：《武训传》一三五—一三六页。）
    而当最后一次武训与周大见面时，武训又一次说“单凭杀就行吗？……那么多的人怎么杀得完呢？……”，“周大的头不由得低了下来。他绉眉恨恨地说：‘可惜咱们就是少一个好的头领给咱们好好地带路。洪秀全在南京登了宝座就忘记了咱穷人！……’”（仝上，一六九—一七○页）
    这不是什么正确的历史的批判，而恰是充分表露了作者对农民革命的一种消极的失败主义的看法和情绪。太平军和当时的其它农民革命虽然以失败来结束，但正是历史上几百次农民革命战争打击了封建地主阶级的统治，多少变动了社会的相互关系和推动了生产力的向前发展，因而多少改善了农民自己的生活地位。毛泽东同志就极高地评价了农民战争在历史上的作用，认为“只有这种农民暴动和农民战争，才是中国历史进化的真正动力”。（《中国革命与中国共产党》）因此并不能因为农民战争的失败而降低或甚至抹杀它在中国历史上的伟大作用。中国农民在历次反对封建地主阶级的斗争中所表现出来的坚决精神和英勇气概，则永远值得后人的歌颂。电影末尾，作者借女教师的口对农民革命作了这样的一个总的评价：“单凭农民的报复心理去除霸报仇，也没有把广大群众组织起来。”这样，就把伟大的农民革命战争看成不过一种无组织的、盲目的个人报复行动罢了。这对中国农民战争，难道不是一种极大的污蔑吗？
    人们也许要说，无论如何，电影揭露了农民和地主的矛盾，揭露了以张举人为代表的封建地主的罪恶。但是作者并没有把封建地主统治作为一种阻碍历史前进的社会制度来加以否定，而只是一方面暴露了封建地主中张举人之类的凶恶的人物，但是另一方面却歌颂了实际上同样凶恶的反动地主杨树坊之流，把他描写成“德高望重”的“贤明士绅”；另一个地主郭芬则简直被描写成了农民利益的热烈拥护者，请听他指责张举人的话：“难道你忘了：你吃的、喝的、穿的、住的，都是从庄稼人身上刮来的吗？”这哪里是地主的说话，简直是革命宣传家的语言了！更奇怪的是他的这一席话，竟博得了在座的除了张举人一人而外所有地主的赞赏。电影关于他的演说的效果是这样描写的：
    “激昂正义的呼声，像黄钟大吕响彻了大厅。武训怔怔地抬起昏花的眼，望着那年青的正义维护者。”
    “软坐在地上的武训，耳听着满厅里嗟叹赞许的声音，眼望着四下捐地捐钱的景象，兴奋、感激、惊讶，使他说不出话来。他被扶起，两行热泪像泉水般从脸上淌了下来。……”（电影小说：《武训传》第一六一—一六二页）
    好一首对地主阶级的颂歌！既然作者是把武训当作“站稳了阶级的立场，和封建统治者作了一生一世的斗争”的农民英雄来描写的，那末，可怜可怜，这位农民英雄在这群地主们面前竟是如此渺小，如此卑微，对于地主们的仁慈，如此地感激涕零呵！在这里，作者不是暴露地主而是歌颂地主，不是宣传农民对地主的阶级斗争，而是宣传农民与地主的阶级合作，这难道还不十分明显吗？（⑶⑵）
    电影中的主题歌《武训赞》，一方面歌颂武训个人：“大哉武训，至勇至仁”；另一方面诅咒时代：“世风何薄，大陆日沉”。即使作者诅咒的是过去的时代，这种诅咒也是错误的。所谓“世风”并不是统一的，有维护封建社会秩序的“世风”，也有破坏封建社会秩序的“世风”。武训受到了封建统治者从满清皇帝到当地官僚地主的一致的宠爱，他所办的“义学”又得到了他们的那样表扬和支持，那末，就封建统治阶级对武训个人的关系来说，这个“世风”不算薄了。但是广大农民是不拥护武训的事业的，他们唾弃武训那种在封建统治者面前卑躬屈膝的无耻的、下贱的叛变行为，而以自己坚苦卓绝的英勇斗争，有力地冲击着封建社会秩序的基础。武训时代的农民革命的大风暴，就是破坏封建社会秩序的大“世风”。代表几千年来封建制度的满清反动统治正面临最后死亡的命运。只有不从农民的立场而从封建地主的立场，不从人民的立场而从人民压迫者的立场来观察问题的人，才能有“世风何薄，大陆日沉”的想法和感觉。对于一个农民大革命的时代，更不用说对于今天人民大革命已取得历史性胜利的时代，发生“世风何薄，大陆日沉”的感叹，正是表露在历史的前进的、革命的、创造的力量面前一种没落阶级的情绪，表现对已经或快要死亡的旧事物、旧思想的惋惜和留恋，和对于正在诞生、成长的新事物、新思想的敌视和恐惧。紧接“世风何薄、大陆日沉”的下面两句是“谁启我愚，谁济我贫”，好像能够启发农民的觉悟，改变农民的贫穷状况的，只有“千古一人”的武训，而并不是农民自己起来斗争，经过斗争的方法来改变自己的贫穷状况，并在斗争中一步步提高自己的觉悟。这样一方面对武训的歌颂就达到了另一方面对农民革命的抹杀、歪曲和污蔑的目的。
            “武训”形象的虚伪和丑恶
    武训本来是封建社会中最丑恶、最虚伪、最反动的奴才之一，电影却要将他描写成为“典型地表现了我们中华民族勤劳、勇敢和智慧的崇高品质”的人物，这就需要艺术上的粉饰和欺骗。但是艺术什么时候都应当是现实之真实的反映，艺术的力量主要就在它的真实性；因此，不管作者费尽多少心机，仍然掩盖不住武训形象的虚伪和丑恶。
    电影首先把武训写成劳动人民中的一个被损害与被侮辱的人物，这种人物是最容易博得一般观众、特别是知识分子观众的同情的。电影塑造了少年武训的形象：“那么的诚实、腼腆、吃苦耐劳、瘦长的个子”，“一付半傻气，半忠实的脸”。（实际上的武训则是虚伪、厚颜、不好劳动，“腰有案板那么粗”的壮实的人）。这个诚实的青年，就因为他为人老实而总是被人欺负坑骗。但他却有他的一套哲学，也就是作者的所谓“乐天的幽默人生观”，实际就是作者的哲学。
    当小桃，那个在电影中比较可爱的人物，不平地对武训说：
    “你干啥专做那些顶脏顶沉顶苦的活？”“别人看你老实，都往你一个人头上推。”
    武训怎么回答呢？
    “顶脏顶沉顶苦的活，总得有人做呀！”他像一个慈悲为怀的佛学家在说，“我不做，谁做呢？”（电影小说：《武训传》第六六页）
    当又一次小桃劝武训不要相信张举人并批评他“太老实”的时候，武训回答道：“可是我做事总得凭良心……”。作者在这里作了一个肯定性的评语：“忠实的人永远都是忠实的——谁能够说：人不应该忠实呢？”（同上，第七三页）
    就这样，作者不但虚构了少年武训的舍命劳动的图画，而且把他的这种奴隶式的劳动态度和对封建地主的盲目忠诚加以美化，比作佛的慈悲心肠，看做一个人应当具有的忠实的品质。这正是地主阶级、资产阶级作家描写劳动人民惯用的观点和写法。
    电影描写了武训第一次见地主张举人的场面：武训如何自惭形秽地把他那露出大趾头来的左脚窘急地移藏在右脚的后面去，一面掸着破袍上的尘土；听见钱妈叫“过来！”又如何在惊慌中一跤仆倒在地上，并把钱妈错认做太太双膝跪在她面前，连呼“老太太”；而当听见周大叫了一声“老爷”，他又如何双膝吓得发颤，两条腿不由自主地跪了下来。这也许倒是“义学症，没火性”的武训的少年时代的真实画像，这是天生的软骨头、奴才相。他一生中的所谓“行乞兴学”就把他的这种奴才相加上流氓性充分发挥出来了。作者却把这样一个奴才当作劳动人民的典型，当作民族英雄来加以歌颂，这是每一个爱国的观众所不能容忍的。
    当观众看到武训头上左边蓄着一条四寸长的小辫，肩上背着布褡，手上提着铜瓢，嘴里义学长义学短地咕噜着，见人叩头作揖的时候，特别看到他跪在地上，敞着衣襟，用拳自捶着胸口喊着：“打一拳，两个钱，踢一脚，三个钱”的时候，许多爱国的观众就都为这个污辱劳动人民、污辱中国民族的丑恶形象所激怒了。就是盲目崇拜武训的观众也不能不为这个丑恶的下贱的形象而感到不安了。
    赵丹在《我怎样演武训》一文中说了他创造武训这个形象的一段颇堪玩味的经验。他们特地到了山东武训的故乡去搜集材料。他找到了“几个所谓武训的后辈或徒弟，其中有一位简直以武训第二自居”，但这些人却使赵丹大大地失望了。他这样地描写着他对他们的印象：“这一批武训事业的‘承继者’，使得我厌恶，害怕，其为名利熏心的庸俗气，借行乞兴学为幌子的不事劳动的二流子，几乎连最起码庄稼人的气味都失掉了。我觉得这些人物是会伤害了真正武训气质的”。这里，赵丹本来找到了理解“真正武训气质”的锁链，但他却把它远远地抛开了，这是因为他不敢正视现实，发掘历史，他的创作态度不是从实际出发，而是从主观臆想出发的缘故。他完全离开了现实主义的道路。他叙述他在当地“交了三个朋友，一个是庄稼人，一个是武训师范校长的小儿子，一个是学校里养的一匹小骡子。”这三个朋友，就大大帮助了我们的艺术家的创造的工作。他说：“这一切似乎都与武训无关，但从这朴实的、淳厚的、人民的形象中，和那种真善真爱的感情中我看见了武训的影子。”亲爱的作者呵，你什么时候从小骡子身上发现了“人民的”形象和那种“真善真爱”的感情？你眼中的劳动人民，你们所常常那么赞扬的所谓劳动人民的“朴实”、“淳厚”等等，难道就是这种样子吗？小资产阶级、资产阶级的艺术家就是惯于这样去“表现”和“歌颂”劳动人民的呵！
    因此，电影《武训传》虽然是歌颂武训的，却仍然没有能够创造出武训的什么可爱的形象来。
    那末，究竟又有什么东西使得武训这个本来应当引起观众的憎恶和鄙视的形象竟引起了许多观众的同情和崇敬呢？
    关键还不只是在于作者把武训描写为被损害、被侮辱，到处下跪求人，值得同情和怜悯的人物，而更重要的，是在把武训的到处磕头下跪的卑贱行为和他的所谓“为穷孩子兴学”的高尚理想与所谓“三十年如一日”的毅力结合起来，于是一个封建奴才的滑稽小丑变成了凭自己一人的力量终生反抗封建压迫的悲剧式的英雄人物，因而就很容易地赢得了许多观众，特别是知识分子观众的赞赏和尊敬。
    要使小丑变成英雄，不但需要艺术上的巧妙安排，而且需要理论上的解说。请听一听《武训传》作者孙瑜先生的充满“哲学”意味的议论罢。
    “逗得世上的人笑了——究竟比叫世人流泪好得多。
    于是武训就这样勇敢地选择了他自己能力范围里的一条路，以小丑的姿态出现在百十年前的封建社会的街头，准备接受任何的艰苦和笑骂，想凭他个人的悲剧性的反抗，替穷人争一口气，为下一代的孩子们争取受教育的机会。从他的含泪的笑眼里，我们看出了武训——劳动人民的儿子——对他同命运的无产阶级（？？—引用者）一种真挚的、农民的无比的热爱。”（电影小说：《武训传》第一一五页）
    电影《武训传》极力地渲染了他的个人反抗的悲剧性，正在这个悲剧性中，对个人奋斗和个人英雄主义作了最大的歌颂。他把武训故意描写为五岁丧父，七岁丧母的孤儿，一方面引起观众对孤儿命运易于引起的同情，另一方面好叫他从小就养成孤独的坚强性格，长大以后做出惊人的事业。他特意地穿插了一个对武训一生具有那样重大意义的带有象征味道的不倒翁：
        “不倒翁，不倒翁，
        总在笑，总在冲，
        扳也扳不倒，
        摔也不喊痛。”
    好像武训就是这样一个不倒翁，他为实现自己“兴学”的理想而坚韧地、百折不挠地奋斗一生，跌倒了，又爬起来。兴学成为武训的一生中的“美梦”、“美丽的理想”。这个“美梦”和“理想”最后终于实现了。小桃，在影片中是除了周大之外唯一有反抗性的人物，但作者却让她那样早地夭折。她的死与其说是由于封建地主阶级的迫害，更不如说是由于她作了武训的理想的殉道者。她戴上她娘留给她的一朵红花死去。她的悲惨的死被美化了，这样，就无形之中大大削弱了由于她的死而必然引起的对封建地主制度的仇恨。
    “人可以为一个美丽的理想快乐地死去，或者艰苦地活着的”，《武训传》作者这样写着。于是小桃的悲惨地死去，和武训的屈辱地活着，就都找着了最高尚的理由。
    武训就这样被描写成一个孤独的理想主义者。“他走的是一条很苦很苦的路，也是一条很长很长的路。”一个“肩背布褡，手提铜瓢，在北方原野上迟缓地、但是坚定地走着”的孤独者的形象就庄严神圣地出现在观众面前，引起观众，特别是小资产阶级知识分子观众的感动和崇敬。
    赵丹正是按照编剧者的这个企图和他自己个人的心境来扮演了武训这个角色。他在上述的《我怎样演武训》的文章中，作了关于他的心情的忠实的自白：
    “……出狱后生活与工作都与时代形成了严重的脱节现象，同时又加上年青人之不甘屈服的崛强性，一面急于要回到现实斗争的生活中来，一面却又不知从何着手（这正是小资产阶级知识分子的性格）。基于这些错综痛苦的心境，找着了这位武训先生，就像找着一位知己，一位共过患难的朋友一样；我想我是有理由拥抱着他放声痛哭的。当时我简直觉得只有我才能完全了解他……也只有我才知道当一个人傻气地为着真理正义进行每种事业而不被人们所理解，反之或加以诋毁讥讽时的心理的凄楚和寒冷的滋味呵！……我自感孤独……”
    革命的小资产阶级知识分子在没有和群众结合的时候总是表现脆弱的。在革命形势前进或后退的关头，他们都时常要发生彷徨的感觉，他们意识到自己和时代与人民的距离而感到寂寞孤独，他们抱怨别人不理解自己，仿佛自己心中不知有多少委屈，甚至觉得革命是只有傻子才干的事情。他们在感到自己脆弱的时候，就需要有一种力量来支持。或者是，从共产主义的宇宙观中，从群众的实际斗争中去吸取力量；这个力量是无穷的；或者是，从个人主义的哲学和个人的奋斗中去寻找救助和鼓励，这就将引导人们走上脱离群众反对群众的道路。电影《武训传》通过武训向观众指引的，正是这样一条道路。
    电影《武训传》污蔑了中国人民历史的道路，宣传了资产阶级的反动思想，用改良主义来代替革命，用个人奋斗来代替群众斗争，用卑躬屈节的投降主义来代替革命的英雄主义。电影中武训的形象是丑恶的、虚伪的，在他身上反映了我国封建社会的黑暗和卑鄙，歌颂他就是歌颂黑暗和卑鄙，就是反人民的，反爱国主义的。
    电影《武训传》的错误是严重的，孙瑜先生应当有勇气承认并揭露这个错误，并在自己以后的艺术行动中改正这个错误。这是真正人民的艺术工作者对于人民应有的起码的责任。
