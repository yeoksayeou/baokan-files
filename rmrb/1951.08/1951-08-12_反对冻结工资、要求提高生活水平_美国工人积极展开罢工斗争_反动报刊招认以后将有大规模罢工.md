Xinhua News Agency, Eleventh Dispatch from New York: According to a dispatch from the Telecommunications Agency in New York: The American Labor Research Institute reported in its August "Economic Notes" that American labor unions are actively fighting against wage freezes and are achieving new victories through strikes. The Labor Research Institute wrote: While Congress is formulating a new Defense Production Act (note: the new law was passed at the end of July), almost all grassroots workers in major industries continue to strive for improved living standards. They demand wage increases higher than the limits set by the Truman administration, shorter work weeks, and other benefits.

Among the unions that have won wage increases and other victories higher than the limit as a result of strikes are the following: the CIO's Telegraph Workers Union, the AFL's Grocery and Confectionery Workers Union, the independent Fur Workers Union, the AFL's Streetcar, Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees Union, and the independent West Coast Longshoremen's Union.

The AFL's Commercial Telegraphers' Union, the CIO's Marine and Shipbuilding Workers Union, the independent Radio Workers Brotherhood, and the independent Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union, among others, also achieved similar victories after threatening to strike. Another seven thousand wage increase agreements have been submitted to the Wage Stabilization Board for approval.

Other unions demanding relaxation of wage controls include the CIO's Woodworkers Union and the CIO's Furniture Workers Union. A representative of the Furniture Workers Union said: "Our union members are determined to lift the wage freeze, just as many unions have already done."

In some industries where contracts do not stipulate automatic reopening of wage negotiations, unrest has begun to occur among a large proportion of grassroots workers. This is reflected in several spontaneous strikes (strikes not approved by union leadership).

The Labor Research Institute wrote: Big businesses are panicking about these situations. The July 13th *Wall Street Journal* predicted: "It is almost certain that there will be more strikes in the coming months." On July 7th, *Business Week* (a major financial magazine) claimed that the current spontaneous strikes are "very important," and the publication believes that if unions do not achieve their goals, these spontaneous strikes "may be the prelude to large-scale strikes in the future."

　　反对冻结工资、要求提高生活水平
    美国工人积极展开罢工斗争 
    反动报刊招认以后将有大规模罢工
    【新华社十一日讯】据电通社纽约讯：美国劳工研究所在它八月份的《经济札记》中报告说，美国的工会正积极为反对冻结工资而斗争，并正以罢工获得新的胜利。劳工研究所写道：当国会正在制订新的国防生产法（按新的法律已于七月底通过）的时候，差不多一切主要行业中的下层工人都继续为提高生活水平而奋斗。他们要求把工资增加到高于杜鲁门政府所规定的限额，要求缩短工作周的时间以及其他福利。
    由于罢工的结果而获得高于限额的工资增加及其他胜利的工会中，有下列各工会：产联的电讯工人工会，劳联的杂货糖果工人工会，独立的毛皮工人工会，劳联的电车、电气火车和汽车工人工会，独立的西海岸码头工人工会。
    劳联的商用电报工人工会、产联的海船工人工会、独立的无线电工人兄弟工会和独立的开采冶炼工人工会等在威胁要罢工后，也获得了同样的胜利。还有七千件增加工资的协议已交工资稳定局等待批准。
    其他要求放松工资管制的工会包括产联的木材工人工会，产联的家具工人工会。家具工人工会的一位代表说：“我们的工会会员决心解除工资冻结，就象许多工会已经做了的那样。”
    在合同未规定自动重开工资谈判的若干行业中，一大部分基层工人中间已开始发生不安情况。这反映在若干自发罢工（未经工会领导上批准的罢工）上。
    劳工研究所写道：大企业对于这些情况是感到恐慌的。七月十三日《华尔街日报》预言：“几乎可以肯定地说，在未来数月中将有更多的罢工。”七月七日，《商业周刊》（一份重要的金融杂志）声称：目前的自发罢工是“很重要的”，该刊并认为：如果工会未达到它们的目的的话，这些自发罢工“可能是以后大规模罢工的前兆”。
