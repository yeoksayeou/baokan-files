　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 21st: TASS, New York, August 18th—The "American Peace Crusade" held a peace rally in New York yesterday, with thousands of people participating. Mr. Stross, head of the American trade union delegation that recently visited the Soviet Union and several European countries, spoke at the meeting.
    The audience listened attentively as Stross described the constructive labor of the Soviet people in building peace and their sincere desire to be friendly with the American people. Whenever Stross spoke of the Soviet people's hope for peace and their desire to establish lasting friendship with the American people, the meeting hall resounded with enthusiastic applause. Stross pointed out that America's enemies of peace are trying their best to prevent the American people from knowing the true situation in the Soviet Union, and America's reactionary newspapers are doing their best to distort the purpose of the American trade union delegation's visit to the Soviet Union.
    Stross cited an example to illustrate how eagerly the American people want to understand the Soviet Union. He said: "We received many letters, telegrams, and postcards. People from all over the United States read brief news about our delegation's visit to the Soviet Union in the newspapers or heard our speeches on the radio, and they called us one after another. These people welcomed the wise call for defending peace and establishing friendship among the peoples of all countries." Stross emphasized that the vast majority of the American people are demanding an end to the bloodshed in Korea.
    Amidst enthusiastic welcome from the audience, Paul Robeson, a leading African-American progressive leader, addressed the meeting, calling for further strengthening the ranks of American peace advocates and intensifying the struggle for peace. Robeson said: "We peace advocates should speak for those who are the real masters of America. There are two Americas: one is the America of a handful of people, and the other is the America of hundreds of millions of people. We belong to the latter. ... We should show the strength of the peace movement and strive for the establishment of peace throughout the world. ... We should find new ways to strive for peace and attract millions more Americans to participate in the peace movement."
    Finally, the meeting sent a telegram to Truman, demanding an immediate end to the Korean War, and a telegram to Attorney General McGrath, demanding the cessation of the prosecution of the famous progressive activist and peace fighter Dr. Du Bois.

　　纽约人民举行和平大会
    要求立即停止朝鲜战争
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：“美国和平十字军”昨日在纽约举行和平大会，有数千人参加。新近访问苏联及若干欧洲国家归来的美国工会代表团团长史特罗斯在大会上讲话。
    大会听众聚精会神地倾听史特罗斯叙述苏联人民进行和平的建设性劳动的情形以及他们希望与美国人民友好的衷心愿望。每逢史特罗斯说到苏联人民希望和平与希望同美国人民建立永久友谊的时候，大会会场便轰然响起热烈的掌声。史特罗斯指出：美国的和平之敌竭力不让美国人民知道苏联的真情实况，美国的反动报纸竭力歪曲美国工会代表团访苏的目的。
    史特罗斯引了一个例子，来说明美国人民如何迫切地希望了解苏联。他说：“我们接到许多信件、电报和明信片。美国各地的人们在报上读到关于我们代表团访苏的简短消息或者从收音机里听到我们的演说后，纷纷打电话给我们。这些人们欢迎关于保卫和平与建立各国人民友谊的明智的号召。”史特罗斯着重指出：绝大多数的美国人民都要求结束朝鲜的流血。
    在听众热烈的欢迎下，美国进步黑人领袖罗伯逊向大会发表演说，他号召进一步加强团结美国和平拥护者的队伍与加紧争取和平的斗争。罗伯逊说：“我们和平拥护者应该为那些真正是美国主人的人们说话。有两个美国：一个是一小撮人的美国，另一个是千百万人民的美国。我们是属于后者的。……我们应当表现出和平运动的力量，为在全世界建立和平而努力。……我们应该寻找新的办法，来争取和平，并吸引千百万更多的美国人参加和平运动。”
    最后，大会致电杜鲁门，要求立即停止朝鲜战争，并致电司法部长麦格拉斯，要求停止对有名进步活动家与和平战士杜波依斯博士的起诉。
