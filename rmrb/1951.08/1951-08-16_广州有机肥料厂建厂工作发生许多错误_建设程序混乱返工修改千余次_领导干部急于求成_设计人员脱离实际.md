The construction of the Guangzhou Organic Fertilizer Plant, under the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Health Bureau, suffered serious losses to state assets due to a lack of thorough planning and engineering design, blind construction, and misuse of funds. Furthermore, it failed to commence production as planned.

**Leading Cadres Sought Quick Success Regardless of Practical Results - Designing and Building Simultaneously Led to Hasty Work**

The Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Health Bureau originally planned to build a "unique national organic fertilizer plant." This plant would scientifically process the city's night soil and garbage into odorless, bacteria-free powdered organic fertilizer. It was estimated to produce 70 tons daily, generating profits of 3 to 5 billion yuan annually. However, the leading cadres of the bureau lacked understanding of basic construction, pursuing quick success without regard for practical results. They only saw the benefits of the fertilizer plant for the city's sanitation work, harboring mistaken beliefs such as "even if we lose money, it's still beneficial" and "night soil and garbage are fertilizer themselves, even if processing fails, it's still fertilizer." The plant construction preparatory committee was established in August of last year. Without proper engineering design, construction began hastily in late September, with design and construction proceeding simultaneously. The bureau also failed to provide specific leadership, inspection, and supervision during the construction process, blindly trusting the technical personnel's guarantees of "certain success." Meetings of the plant construction preparatory committee were infrequent, and many issues were decided solely by technical personnel, leading to a series of errors in the entire basic construction process.

The plant is a manufacturing facility of a chemical industrial nature. The construction sequence should have been: mechanical equipment designed according to chemical industrial requirements, followed by civil engineering design based on the mechanical equipment. However, the preparatory committee's four groups—chemical, mechanical, civil, and management—operated independently, with chemical, mechanical, and civil engineering proceeding almost simultaneously. Conflicts were addressed only when they arose, resulting in extremely serious rework and waste. To date, there have been over a thousand major and minor reworks or modifications to various projects.

**Design Personnel Blindly Relied on British and American Books - No Investigation or Research into Basic Raw Materials**

Another major cause of errors in engineering design was the lack of investigation and research into basic raw materials (garbage and night soil) by the design personnel. The engineers merely used materials from British and American books as the basis for their designs. They did not consider that the night soil in Guangzhou currently contains many impurities. The plant's report stated: "We predicted that night soil would only contain fecal matter and toilet paper, and never imagined finding large amounts of rotten cloth, bamboo strips, etc. We envisioned garbage as fragmented, dispersed waste, but did not know it would be mixed with large amounts of viscous soil and胶质物. These situations were fundamentally different from our initial assumptions." As a result, many machines were unsuitable after installation or required multiple modifications to be usable. For example, in the manufacturing of garbage fertilizer machinery, the first piece of equipment, the vibrating screen, was designed incorrectly due to insufficient understanding of the impurities in garbage. The vibrating screen's performance was very poor and could not remove sand and various inorganic materials from the garbage. After the garbage was sent to the disinfection pool, the debris clogged the screw conveyor at the bottom, preventing the garbage from being transported out, rendering the pool unusable. Similarly, due to insufficient understanding of the viscosity of garbage, the slopes of various passages were inadequate, causing the garbage to stick in the passages and preventing it from sliding down. In the manufacturing of night soil fertilizer machinery, many problems also arose due to insufficient understanding of the impurities in night soil. Night soil pumps were often clogged (later, anti-clogging devices were added at the inlet to resolve this). In particular, the copper mesh filter, a crucial component of the production process, was originally intended to filter out 80% of the water from the night soil. However, since night soil is a colloid, the copper mesh could only filter out a small amount of water, and the filtered night soil could not be dried by the oven. As a result of the ineffectiveness of the filtering and drying equipment, the entire set of night soil fertilizer machinery remains unusable. Furthermore, all the spiral conveyors in the plant (approximately 170 meters long) were incorrectly installed by the engineering personnel and required over a month of correction before they were usable. The garbage rotary dryer also suffered from insufficient heat due to design errors and was incompatible with other machinery, resulting in a production capacity of only about one-seventh of the original plan.

**Failure to Commence Operations as Scheduled Wastes Management Expenses - Will Become a Long-Term Burden After Operations Begin**

The losses due to inadequate prior planning and lack of proper engineering design are severe. First, the fertilizer plant cannot commence production as scheduled. The plant was originally scheduled to begin operations in February of this year, but it has now been delayed for half a year, with no certainty. Management expenses alone for half a year amounted to 480 million yuan. Second, due to the inapplicability of many machines, even if the original production process plan is changed and a large amount of manual labor is used for production, the output and quality will be greatly reduced. Based on the current situation, there is only certainty of producing 10 tons of fertilizer per day. In terms of quality, the nitrogen content of garbage fertilizer can only reach about 75% of the original standard, and the finished product still contains impurities such as sand. In this way, the plant will become a "long-term burden" on Guangzhou's finances. According to estimates by the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Finance Bureau, if it produces 10 tons per day, it will lose 140 million yuan per month. Third, if production is to be carried out according to the original plan, the existing equipment must be overhauled, tested for a considerable period of time, new engineering designs must be made, and the machinery must be rebuilt. According to estimates by Kang Wenbin, Deputy Director of the Health Bureau (one of the main persons in charge of plant construction), this will require an additional investment of about 10 billion yuan.

**Lack of Planning and Systems in the Use of Plant Construction Funds - Guangzhou Municipal Health Bureau and Finance Bureau Neglected Inspection**

The plant lacked planning and systems in the use of plant construction funds, resulting in many malpractices. The plant's original basic construction funds were 12 billion yuan, with a working capital of 5 billion yuan. Due to poor design, engineering costs were continuously added, leading to the complete exhaustion of working capital. As of May 20th of this year, actual expenditures had reached over 18.4 billion yuan, and the project was not yet completed. Some of the funds were also used inappropriately. For example, by the end of 1950, "other expenditures" accounted for 3.136 billion yuan, or 24.5% of total expenditures for the year. The plant purchased and stored a large quantity of non-urgent materials, tying up a lot of funds. The use and management of materials were also quite chaotic, and many materials had no records. The Guangzhou Municipal Health Bureau failed to inspect and correct the chaotic state of finance and management for a long period of time, and the Guangzhou Municipal Finance Bureau also failed to pay attention to inspection.

In June, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government designated the Financial and Economic Commission and the Finance Bureau to organize an inspection team to conduct an in-depth inspection of the plant, only to discover that the plant had caused serious losses to state assets during its construction. As for the extent of the engineering and technical failures, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government has not yet organized experts for a detailed examination. The Health Bureau and the responsible technical personnel have also not made complete and comprehensive engineering designs to correct the deviations. It is still a matter of repairing and researching simultaneously. Jian Haoran, Deputy Director of the plant's preparatory committee (responsible for machine engineering), said: Small repairs are only for testing the machine. Through the testing process, we will check which equipment has completely failed, and then request a large amount of investment for major repairs. It is still uncertain whether production can be carried out according to the original plan.

### 广州有机肥料厂建厂工作发生许多错误  建设程序混乱返工修改千余次  领导干部急于求成·设计人员脱离实际

　　广州有机肥料厂建厂工作发生许多错误
    建设程序混乱返工修改千余次
    领导干部急于求成·设计人员脱离实际
    广州市人民政府卫生局所属广州有机肥料厂的建厂工作，缺乏周密计划和工程设计，盲目施工，滥用资金，使国家资财遭受了严重的损失。并且不能按计划开工生产。
    领导干部只求速成不管实效  一边施工一边设计手忙脚乱
    广州市人民政府卫生局原定计划是要建设一个“全国唯一的有机肥料厂”。这个厂，可以将全市的粪溺和垃圾，经过科学加工，制成无臭味、无细菌的粉状的有机肥料；并且估计每日可产七十吨，每年可获利三十至五十亿元。但该局领导干部对基本建设问题认识不足，只求速成，不管实效；只看到肥料厂建设起来有利于城市的卫生工作，存有“赔本也有好处”、“粪溺垃圾本身就是肥料，即使加工制造失败也还是肥料”等错误思想。去年八月建厂筹备委员会成立。工程设计还没有做好，九月底就一边施工，一边设计，手忙脚乱地干起来。在施工过程中，该局又未进行具体领导与检查督促，盲目相信技术人员提出的“一定成功”的保证。建厂筹备委员会的会议也不经常，许多问题只由技术人员商量决定，以致整个基本建设发生了一连串的错误。
    该厂是属于化学工业性质的制造工厂。建设程序应当是机械设备依照化学工业的要求设计，土木工程依照机械设备进行设计。但是，筹备委员会的化学、机械、土木、管理四组各自为政，化学、机械、土木工程差不多是齐头并进，发生矛盾时才加以修改，因此返工浪费极为严重。至目前为止，各种工程大大小小的返工或修改，已在一千次以上。
    设计人员盲目依靠英美书本  对于基本原料没有调查研究
    工程设计错误的另一个主要原因，是设计人员对基本原料（垃圾和大粪）没有进行调查研究。工程师们只是以英美书本上的材料作为设计的根据。他们没有想到目前广州市的粪溺中所含的杂物很多。该厂的报告书说：“我们预测的粪溺，只含粪水、草纸，绝对没有想到里面发现多量的烂布、竹篾等；理想中的垃圾是零碎的分散的废物，却不知道会夹着大量黏性泥土和胶质物在其中。这些情形根本就脱离我们当时的假定。”因此，很多机械装建好后根本就不合用，或者要经多次修改才能用。例如在制造垃圾肥料机械方面，就由于对垃圾所含的杂物认识不足，第一道设备的震选机就设计错误。震选机的效能很差，不能将垃圾中的砂石及各种无机物清除；垃圾送下消毒池后，垃圾中的杂物就将池底的螺旋输送器塞死，垃圾无法运出，以致该池现尚不能使用；同样由于对垃圾的黏性认识不足，各通路的斜度都不够，以致垃圾常在通路上黏结，不能滑下。又如在制造粪溺肥料机械方面，也是由于对粪溺中所含的杂物认识不足，发生了很多问题。粪溺泵常常被塞住（后来在入口处加了防塞设备才可使用）。特别是生产过程中一个重要的环节——铜网过滤机，原定是要滤去粪溺中百分之八十的水分的，但实际上粪溺是胶体，铜网仅能将其中水分滤去很少，过滤后的粪溺仍然不能为烘炉所烘干；而由于过滤与烘干设备失却效用的结果，全套制粪溺肥料的机械至今还不能使用。还有，全厂的螺旋输送器（长约一七○公尺）都因工程人员安装错误，经过一个多月的修正才适用；垃圾回旋烘干炉，也因设计错误，热力不足，与其他机械不相称，以致产量仅及原计划的七分之一左右。
    不能如期开工浪费管理费用  开工后也将成为长期的包袱
    由于事先计划不周，以及无正确的工程设计，损失是严重的。首先是肥料厂不能如期开工生产。该厂原定在今年二月开工，现在拖延了半年仍没把握，单是半年的管理费用一项就支出了四亿八千万元。第二，由于许多机械不能应用，即使改变原定生产过程的计划，辅以大量人工来进行生产，产量和质量也都将大大打折扣。据目前情形看，每日只能有把握产十吨肥料；质量方面，垃圾肥的含氮量只能达到原标准的百分之七十五左右，而且成品中仍含有砂石等杂质。这样，该厂将成为广州市财政上的“长期包袱”。据广州市人民政府财政局估计，如每天产十吨，每月将要赔一亿四千万元。第三，如果要照原定计划出产，必须把现有设备普遍检修一次，经过相当长时间的试验，做出新的工程设计，重新改建机械；这样，据卫生局康文彬副局长（建厂主要负责人之一）的估计，要再增加一百亿元左右的投资，才有可能。
    运用建厂资金缺乏计划和制度  广州市卫生局财政局疏于检查
    该厂对建厂资金的运用，缺乏计划和制度，流弊很多。该厂原定基本建设资金一百二十亿元，流动资金五十亿元。因设计不周，不断追加工程费用，致流动资金已全部用完，至今年五月二十日止，实际支出已达一百八十四亿元以上，尚未完工。其中部分资金的运用也不恰当。例如，至一九五○年底止，实际支出中“其他支出”一栏竟占三十一亿三千六百万元，占同年总支出的百分之二四·五。该厂曾购存大批不急需的材料，积压了很多资金。材料的使用与管理也相当混乱，很多材料都无账可查。对于财务和管理上的混乱状态，广州市卫生局长时期未进行检查纠正，广州市财政局也没有注意检查。
    六月间，广州市人民政府指定财政经济委员会、财政局组织检查小组到该厂深入检查，才发现该厂在建厂工作中已使国家资财遭受严重损失。至于工程技术上到底失败到怎样的程度，广州市人民政府至今还未组织专家作详细的考查。卫生局和负责的技术人员也仍未作出完整的通盘的修正偏差的工程设计。仍然是一边修理，一边研究。该厂筹委会副主任简浩然（负责机器工程）说：小修只是为了试机，通过试机过程来检查那些设备已完全失效，然后再要求大量投资进行大修。能否照原定计划生产，目前尚无把握。
