Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 21st Dispatch: Our front-line reporter reports: While the U.S. side's insistence on unreasonable demands regarding the military demarcation line has brought the armistice negotiation meeting to a standstill, the attack activities of the U.S. aggressor army and the Li pseudo-army have become increasingly frenzied. On the eastern front, the attacks by the U.S.-Li army are continuous. On the 11th, a company attacked our position north of Yangkou three times; on the 12th, a company to two companies attacked our positions northwest of Gancheng, north of Linshui; on the 13th, two companies to a battalion attacked two of our positions north of Linshui; on the 14th, a company to two companies attacked three of our positions north of Yangkou; on the 15th, a company to a battalion attacked three of our positions north of Yangkou and Linshui; on the 16th, a company to a battalion attacked our Xiangling position north of Yangkou four times. In the area near Kaesong on the western front, the U.S.-Li army's offensive is also intensifying. On the 14th, two companies sneaked into the area northwest of Gaolangpu-ri, and on the 15th, two battalions continuously attacked our positions along the Dadushan-Liyan Cave line north of Changdan. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, waiting in full battle array, continued to inflict heavy blows on the invading enemy in the aforementioned areas. A certain unit holding a high ground north of Yangkou fiercely fought the enemy for eight hours, heroically repelling eight attacks by an enemy battalion, and killing or wounding 295 enemy soldiers.

    In a counterattack battle on a high ground north of Linshui, a certain unit killed or wounded more than 150 enemy soldiers, and then killed or wounded more than 70 invading enemy soldiers from another unit. A certain unit holding the Dadushan-Liyan Cave line north of Changdan killed or wounded more than 200 enemy soldiers in a heroic blocking battle. In other areas, the Chinese and Korean People's forces also inflicted similarly heavy casualties on the invading enemy with staunch blocking and counterattack battles. According to incomplete statistics, in the five days from the 11th to the 15th, the Chinese and Korean People's forces annihilated a total of more than 2,800 enemy soldiers, destroyed four enemy tanks, and also shot down or damaged 36 enemy aircraft in the front and rear airspace.

　　美李匪军攻击活动愈益疯狂
    中朝部队续予敌严重打击
    五天歼敌近三千毁伤敌机三十六架
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】本社前线记者报道：当美方坚持关于军事分界线的蛮横无理要求致使停战谈判会议无法进展之际，美国侵略军和李伪军的攻击活动也愈来愈疯狂了。在东线，美李军的攻击是连日不断的。十一日以一个连向我杨口以北阵地攻击三次；十二日以一个连到两个连分别向我麟蹄以北杆城西北阵地攻击；十三日以两个连到一个营分别向我麟蹄以北的两个阵地攻击；十四日以一个连到两个连分别向我杨口以北的三个阵地攻击；十五日以一个连到一个营分别向我杨口、麟蹄以北的三个阵地攻击；十六日先后以一个连到一个营向我杨口以北项岭阵地攻击四次。在西线开城附近地区，美李军的进攻也日益加紧。十四日以两个连窜至高浪浦里西北地区，十五日以两个营连续攻我长湍以北大德山、立岩洞一线阵地。严阵以待的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军则继续在上述地区予进犯之敌以惨重的打击。坚守在杨口以北某高地的某部与敌激战八小时，英勇击退敌一个营的八次攻击，并毙伤敌二百九十五名。
    某部在麟蹄以北某高地的反击战中，毙伤敌一百五十余名之后，又毙伤另部犯敌七十余人。坚守在长湍以北大德山、立岩洞一线的某部，在英勇的阻击战中杀伤敌二百多名。在其他地区中、朝人民部队也都以坚强的阻击战和反击战使犯敌遭受到同样严重的伤亡。据不完全的统计，在十一日至十五日的五天中，中朝人民部队共计歼敌二千八百余人，击毁敌战车四辆，另外并在前线和后方的上空击落击伤敌机三十六架。
