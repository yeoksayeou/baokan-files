　　Intensify Weapon Donations to Support the Front and Consolidate National Defense
    Cash Donations Exceed 400 Billion Yuan
    Nearly 2,400 Aircraft Pledged, with Over 110 Billion Yuan Paid in the Last Nine Days
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Amidst the angry protests of the people nationwide against American imperialism sabotaging the Korean armistice talks and the Anglo-American separate peace treaty with Japan, the movement to donate weapons is continuing to unfold, with enthusiastic cash contributions to support the front and consolidate national defense. According to statistics from the China Peace Committee, from August 21st to 29th, in these nine days, local payments reached over 113.6 billion yuan; together with previous payments, the total exceeds 403.3 billion yuan. The number of weapons pledged by various localities has also continued to increase. According to statistics on the 29th, various localities have pledged 2,398 aircraft, 170 artillery pieces, 84 anti-aircraft guns, and 5 tanks. Some units have already completed their donation plans ahead of schedule, and people or units in many regions are working hard to implement plans to increase production and donations. For example, the industrial and commercial sectors, the financial industry, and the cotton, yarn, and silk fabric industry in Tianjin City have each pledged two aircraft and have paid all the cash. The people of the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region in Gansu Province pledged an aircraft, and by the 1st, they had paid a total of over 1.7 billion yuan in RMB and the equivalent value in kind. Qixin Cement Factory in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, has completed its plan ahead of schedule, donating the "Tangshan Qixin No. 1" and "Tangshan Qixin No. 2" aircraft, with a total donation of 3 billion yuan, which was paid off on July 24th and August 18th respectively, and received commendation from the Tangshan City Branch of the China Peace Committee. The people of Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, originally planned to donate the first "Mao Zedong's Hometown" fighter plane by the end of September, but by August 26th, the amount paid had exceeded 1.5 billion yuan. The industrial and commercial sectors in Suzhou City, Southern Jiangsu Province, Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, and Taizhou City, Northern Jiangsu Province, have all held collective payment sessions according to their donation plans. The Suzhou City industrial and commercial sector also wrote letters to the industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai and Southern Jiangsu, launching a patriotic production increase and donation movement competition, guaranteeing collective payment on schedule, and striving to complete the task ahead of schedule and exceed the quota. When the People's Representatives Conference was held in Wuxi City from the 22nd to the 25th, the more than 380 representatives present expressed great anger at the American imperialists bombing the Kaesong Neutral Zone and deliberately sabotaging the armistice talks. The meeting passed a resolution: to continue to mobilize people from all walks of life to formulate production increase and donation plans, make payments on schedule, and ensure the completion of the plan to donate 33 aircraft by the end of the year. During the meeting, the city's industrial and commercial sector collectively paid 5.2 billion yuan in donations.
    However, the development of the donation movement is currently uneven across the country. Many regions have universally and deeply launched this movement. For example, more than 90% of the workers in Nanjing City have formulated production increase and donation plans, and 70% of suburban farmers and urban residents have formulated donation plans, and the plans of the industrial and commercial sectors have been promoted from industries to factories and stores. In Taihe County, Northern Anhui Province, the number of households in the county that have formulated production increase and donation plans accounts for 94% of the total number of households. However, some places have not yet grasped the leadership of this movement. For example, Linqu and Nangong counties in Hebei Province have not yet convened anti-American and aid-Korea representative conferences to carry out this work well. In addition, the payment situation of various sectors in various places is also uneven. For example, by August 7th, the industrial and commercial sector in Chongqing City had paid more than 2 billion yuan. Some industries in the city were extremely enthusiastic when paying, but some industries were slower, such as the pharmaceutical industry, which includes more than 1,000 companies, but by August 6th, only one had paid. Therefore, the leading organs in various places must use greater strength to promote this movement.
    Secondly, almost every province and city has individual places where some shortcomings or deviations have occurred in the movement, such as the phenomenon of coercion and command, and donations not being combined with increased production. Many regions have paid attention to checking, correcting, and preventing these phenomena, but some regions have not paid enough attention to them. Facts in various places prove that only when the leading organs, organize cadres and activists, carry out in-depth publicity work, and correctly grasp the principles of conscious voluntarism and combining it with increased production and increased income, can this movement be better carried out. For example, in the fourth district of Qichun County, Hubei Province, because the publicity work was not done well at the beginning of the donation movement, the masses only pledged more than 5.7 million yuan; in July, the district held a cadres' meeting, corrected the cadres' "pure task viewpoint," and deeply mobilized the masses, and the people's pledged amount increased to more than 77 million yuan in RMB and 610 shi of rice.

　　加紧捐献武器支援前线巩固国防
    各地缴纳现款已逾四千亿元
    认捐飞机接近二千四百架最近九天缴款一千一百余亿
    【本报讯】全国人民在抗议美帝国主义破坏朝鲜停战谈判，反对美英单独对日媾和的愤怒声中，正继续展开捐献武器运动，踊跃缴纳献款，以支援前线，巩固国防。据抗美援朝总会统计，自二十一日至二十九日九天中，各地缴款达一千一百三十六亿多元；连前共已缴款四千零三十三亿元以上。各地认捐武器数字亦续有增加，据二十九日统计，各地已认捐飞机二千三百九十八架，大炮一百七十门，高射炮八十四门，坦克五辆。有的单位已提前完成捐献计划，许多地区人民或单位都在努力执行增产捐献计划。例如天津市工商界金融业和花纱绸布业，各认捐飞机两架，都已全部缴足现款。甘肃天祝藏族自治区人民认捐飞机一架，到一日止已缴纳人民币及实物折价共十七亿余元。河北唐山市启新洋灰厂已提前实现计划，捐出“唐山启新第一号”、“唐山启新第二号”飞机两架，全部献款三十亿元，已分别在七月二十四日和八月十八日缴清，获得了唐山市抗美援朝分会的表扬。湖南湘潭市人民原计划在九月底献出“毛泽东故乡号”战斗机的第一架，至八月二十六日止缴款数已超过十五亿元。苏南苏州市、河北石家庄市、苏北泰州市等处的工商界，都按捐献计划举行了集体缴款。苏州市工商界并写信向上海和苏南各地工商界发起爱国增产捐献运动竞赛，保证按期集体缴款，并争取提前超额完成。无锡市在二十二日至二十五日举行各界人民代表会议时，到会的三百八十余名代表对于美帝国主义轰炸开城中立区，蓄意破坏停战谈判，表示极大愤怒。会上通过决议：继续发动各界人民订立增产捐献计划，按期缴款，保证在年底前完成捐献三十三架飞机的计划。在会议举行期间，该市工商界集体缴纳了捐款五十二亿元。
    但目前各地捐献运动的发展还不平衡。许多地区已普遍、深入地开展这一运动。如南京市工人已有百分之九十以上订出增产捐献计划，郊区农民和城市居民订出捐献计划的都达百分之七十，工商界的计划已由行业推进到工厂商店。皖北太和县全县订出增产捐献计划的户数已占总户数的百分之九十四。但有的地方对这一运动的领导仍未抓紧，如河北省的临榆、南宫等县，还未召开抗美援朝代表会来很好地开展这一工作。此外，各地各界缴款的情况也不平衡。如重庆市工商界到八月七日止已缴款二十余亿元，该市有些行业缴款时情绪极为热烈，但有些行业就缴款较为迟缓，如包括一千多家的药业，到八月六日已缴款的还只有一户。因此，各地领导机关还须以更大力量来推动这一运动。
    其次，各省、市差不多都有个别地方在运动中产生了一些缺点或偏向，如强迫命令现象，捐献不结合增产等。许多地区已注意检查纠正和防止发生这些现象，但某些地区仍未予以足够的重视。各地事实证明，只有领导机关，组织干部和积极分子，深入开展宣传工作，正确地掌握自觉自愿与结合增加生产、增加收入的原则，才能更好地开展这一运动。如湖北蕲春县第四区在捐献运动的初期，因为宣传工作做得不好，群众仅认捐五百七十余万元；七月份该区召开了干部会议，纠正了干部的“单纯任务观点”，深入发动群众，该区人民认捐数字才提高到了人民币七千七百多万元和稻谷六百一十石。
