How to Do a Good Job in Engineering Design?
Xu Wenshi, Deputy Engineer, Northeast Coal Mining Administration

  I.  Correctly Recognize the Importance of Engineering Design

Since the People's Daily published the editorial "Construction is Impossible Without Engineering Design" on June 16, it has continuously published many examples of the failure of basic construction projects that started without careful design or without any design at all. We were shocked to see this. These articles and reports are worth studying carefully by those of us engaged in basic construction. We must never repeat such mistakes in the future, causing losses to the country.

Some people think that engineering design is very easy and can be completed with a crash effort. As a result, the design is not well considered, and the construction fails completely; or the design is changed from time to time during construction, resulting in repeated rework, wasting the country's resources and extending the time required for the project. Others think that design is extremely difficult. The objective conditions are insufficient, there are few personnel, the task is heavy, and the time is urgent, so incomplete design is excusable. These are all incorrect views.

In fact, engineering design is a very detailed and complex comprehensive work, involving a wide range of factors. Before designing, we should collect all relevant data as much as possible, conduct detailed investigation, research, and analysis, combine theory and experience, and develop several technical and economic plans for comparison. Then, we should select the most economical and practical one, make a design, and produce construction drawings, which can be used as the basis for construction.

All engineering designs should rationally utilize all buildings and equipment, and should strive to ensure higher labor productivity, lower costs, compliance with safety regulations, creation of superior working conditions, and rational use of basic construction funds.

Poor engineering design not only wastes funds during construction, but also affects production for decades to come. It will have a negative impact on future construction and directly affect the process of national industrialization. Therefore, engineering design is the most fundamental link in basic construction, and its importance cannot be ignored.

  II. Basic Methods for Doing a Good Job in Engineering Design

  A. Design is Impossible Without Correct Design Original Data

Everyone knows that without investigation and research, there is no right to speak. The same is true for design. Without design original data or without correct data, design cannot be carried out. Otherwise, it is blind design. Many of the examples published in the People's Daily were designed without basis, or based on incorrect data, so they failed. Correct design original data is partly collected by the design institution itself, but most of it must be provided by the client. To ensure the accuracy of the data, the units and personnel providing the design original data must sign and stamp to be responsible for the accuracy of the data.

Design original data is broad and varies depending on the design object. The main ones include the economic and industrial characteristics of the plant area, climate, topography, engineering geology, highways, railways, power, water supply and drainage, raw material supply, and resource conditions. Before the design, the design institution can form a data collection team headed by the chief engineer to go to the construction site to investigate and collect data. In the past, some people designed based only on experience, but now there must be a correct basis. For example, the construction site must have data on groundwater, soil conditions, and bearing capacity; the mining area must first investigate the reserves before starting design. Although this may delay the start of basic construction projects, it ensures that there is no blind design and blind construction.

  B. Design Tasks Should Be Decided Early, and Investigation and Survey Should Be Carried Out Early

Design requires a considerable amount of time. Especially today, when we lack design personnel and have no experience, everything must start from scratch, which requires even more time. Normal design is divided into three stages: basic design, technical design, and construction drawings. From collecting design original data to drawing construction drawings, including the time for review and approval, a general design (such as building a mine, building a large factory, etc.) takes about one to two years. If the design original data is insufficient, additional investigation and exploration are required, which will take even longer. According to Soviet design experience, designing a vertical shaft with a daily output of two to three thousand tons of coal requires thirty to forty designers for basic design alone, working for two months; technical design requires one hundred designers, working for six months; draftsmen and other staff are not included. Therefore, design tasks should be decided early so that they can be carried out in a well-planned manner according to the design procedure, avoiding crash-style design.

Obviously, investigation and survey work should be completed before the start of the design to provide correct design original data. However, investigation and survey work cannot be completed in a short period of time. In some places, it is even affected by weather conditions and can only be carried out during a certain period. For an ordinary coalfield, it takes at least two years from geological survey to drilling and calculating reserves, even under the best conditions. The construction of reservoirs or canals also requires a long period of investigation and survey. Even the foundation of large buildings must be drilled and the soil analyzed. All of this takes a considerable amount of time. Therefore, investigation and survey work should be carried out several years earlier than construction work.

 C. When Deciding on the Design Policy, Long-Term Plans Should Be Made

When deciding on the design policy, we should consider the long term and not be short-sighted, only considering the immediate interests, so that later, as the enterprise gradually develops, it cannot be expanded. This is true not only in urban design and factory design, but also in the design of a mine, where we must consider the connection problem when opening other mines in the future, and the methods to increase production when needed.

  D. New Designs or Creations Must Go Through a Trial Production Stage

No matter what design or creation, it is difficult to be perfect at the beginning. It must go through trial production, correct its shortcomings, and gain experience before it can be built or manufactured without failure. A mechanical factory in Northeast China suffered losses when it mass-produced air compressors without properly gaining trial production experience, which is a very obvious example. Therefore, this principle must be followed.

 E. Design Drawings Should Be Strictly Checked After Completion, and Design Institutions Should Regularly Send People to Inspect During Construction

To avoid insufficient communication between design departments and drawing errors, and whether the materials and mechanical equipment used in the design meet the standards, design institutions should establish a strict inspection system, with dedicated personnel responsible for checking each drawing, and only issue them when there are no errors. The Soviet Union pays great attention to this point. Its design institutions have a standards department to handle this matter.

To supervise whether the construction is carried out according to the design, the design institution should regularly send people to inspect during construction. This not only avoids the mutual shifting of responsibility between construction and design when the project fails, but also allows for close contact with the construction department based on the actual situation on site, studying the gains and losses of the design, and correcting unreasonable designs so that progress can be made gradually.

 III. Necessary Improvements in Institutions and Systems

 A. The Strength of National Design Personnel Should Be Concentrated

In the past, many engineering designs in China were contracted by imperialists, preventing Chinese people from participating, so there have always been few Chinese designers. Moreover, design is a combination of theory and experience. A designer not only needs to have a high level of professional theory, but also should have practical construction experience. Therefore, the quality requirements should be very high. According to Soviet experience, it takes three years to train a coal mine designer. Therefore, it may not be easy to substantially supplement design personnel at present. Even with such few personnel, they are still scattered throughout the country. Some of them have to do other business in addition to design, and some work is duplicated. In some places, large designs cannot be carried out due to the lack of personnel; in other places, design is needed but there are no designers. To remedy these shortcomings and effectively use these designers, it is best to concentrate national design personnel and accept basic construction designs from various departments across the country.

 B. Engineering Terminology Should Be Unified, and Engineering Specifications and Standard Designs Should Be Established

Except for a few, most of China's engineering circles do not have unified engineering terminology. Clearly the same thing is called differently, which is an obstacle to engineering progress. The design institution should collect the names commonly used by everyone, give them appropriate names, and then have a committee composed of authoritative figures in the engineering field review and publish them for adoption. Engineering specifications are also different. One set is for those who studied in Japan, and another set is for those who studied in the United States. Neither is completely suitable for China's national conditions, and there is no fixed standard for design. The design institution should refer to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the national conditions of China to develop a draft, which should also be reviewed and published by a committee composed of engineers. To implement a planned economy and save design manpower, several standard design types should be developed to supply projects with similar conditions for adoption, and can be used as a reference for technical workers. These, of course, cannot be completed in a short period of time, but after they are completed, design will be much easier than it is now, and it can accelerate design and reduce design costs.

 C. Design Institutions Should Establish Close Ties with Academic Institutions, Research Institutions, and Manufacturers

In design, specialized problems are often encountered that cannot be solved quickly or at all with the manpower and equipment of the design institution itself. It is necessary to entrust academic institutions or research institutions to conduct research and experiments, so there should be close ties between them. At the same time, academic institutions and research institutions should also notify design institutions when there are new discoveries or research results. Manufacturers and design institutions should have even closer ties. Designers should know what each manufacturer can manufacture and what the production capacity is. When there are new products, they should be notified to the design institutions in time for adoption. In this way, the design work can gradually advance.

 D. Quality Tests Should Be Universally Carried Out on Domestic Machinery and Materials

One of the biggest difficulties felt in design now is that many domestic machines and materials lack quality test results, and the specifications and performance are not detailed enough, so designers dare not adopt them or cannot adopt them. Even when they are adopted, for safety reasons, they can only use higher safety factors. This is improper and uneconomical. It is hoped that in the future, institutions that produce various products and materials will publish the quality and performance of their products for adoption.

 E. A Good Design Award System Should Be Implemented

To improve design quality, we can imitate the Soviet method. After each design is completed, a review committee should review its content when it is reviewed and approved. If the design is rated as excellent, the designer can be given a bonus; if it is rated as medium, there is no bonus; if it is rated as poor, it must be redesigned. The evaluation criteria should focus on the design content, supplemented by the design time. The review committee should have the chief design engineer and experts participate.

 IV. Ideological Understanding Issues of Design Personnel

 A. Carry Out Design with a Bold and Responsible Attitude Based on Engineering Principles

Based on the published examples, there are three deviations in the thinking of designers: one is that the design is too large, committing the disease of extravagance, disregarding or not understanding the needs of current conditions, resulting in prolonging the construction period, wasting national investment, or accumulating national funds. One is to disregard the design conditions, whether the data is sufficient or not, and to accommodate the client without principle. Another is that due to the old idea of "protecting oneself wisely," they are afraid of taking responsibility after the project fails, so they try to make the design as solid as possible, using a very large safety factor, losing the principle of engineering economy, which is also a waste of national resources. We must resolutely fight against these ideas in the future and carry out design with a realistic, bold, and responsible attitude based on engineering principles.

The first deviation can be corrected as long as we eliminate the "masterpiece thinking" and conduct detailed investigation and research and carefully consider the problem before designing. The second deviation can also be avoided as long as designers insist on not carrying out blind design and designing according to engineering principles. When the client has opinions, they should explain the advantages and disadvantages in detail, and they will definitely agree. In addition to designers eliminating the "employment point of view" and designing with a sense of ownership, the quality specifications of domestic machinery and materials and engineering specifications should be made as soon as possible to completely correct the third deviation.

 B. Thoroughly Understand Your Own Design Capabilities

Basic construction is a major plan for a century and should be carefully designed. Designers should thoroughly understand their own capabilities. When problems are encountered that cannot be solved, they should read more books, ask the masses, and conduct more investigations and research. Do not be self-righteous, or design and push it out when you have no confidence at all, deceiving yourself and others.

 C. Try to Use Domestic Equipment and Materials as Much as Possible During Design

There are still some people who love to use foreign orders in design. On the one hand, this is because there are no such products in China, and on the other hand, even if there are such products, there is a lack of detailed descriptions of performance and specifications, and at the same time, the efficiency is not as high as that of foreign products, or the quality is low and the price is high. For the convenience and safety of design, they do not like to use domestic products. This is good for a single project, but it is not appropriate from the perspective of developing the entire national industry. For example, a mine needs a 1,000-kilowatt motor. Because there are no products in China, it always orders from abroad. Then our electrical factories will never have the opportunity to make such motors, and they will never gain experience. I suggest that future designs should use domestic products for all equipment and materials that can be produced in China, and only order from abroad when they cannot be manufactured. This is a matter of principle, and manufacturers must also find ways to improve quality and ensure quality.

 D. Strive to Improve Your Political and Professional Level

In the past, most designers had a purely technical point of view, considered themselves superior, were divorced from the masses, and believed in their own set of experiences. After liberation, although the political level has gradually improved through learning, we should still step up political study, transform ourselves, and truly serve the people wholeheartedly in order to keep up with the design requirements of the new China. We also feel that we are lagging behind in our professional field and are not enough to meet the new needs. We should step up our study of the advanced experience and the latest technology of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the learning of design personnel should emphasize both politics and profession.

At present, design is indeed an arduous and heavy task, but we must not be afraid of difficulties. We must strengthen learning, improve the organization, change the way we work, and insist on ensuring that every construction has a correct engineering design. After the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, design was also without foundation, and the environment at that time was much worse than it is now. At that time, they could only learn from their enemies. But now we have the assistance of our friendly country, the Soviet Union, which is an advantageous condition for us. As long as we are willing to work hard, we will be able to overcome difficulties and achieve considerable results.

Construction projects that have already started without correct design should be carried out cautiously, except for those with special errors that must be stopped, and correct designs should be accelerated. Construction projects that have not yet started should be postponed if there is no correct design.

Since design work is related to the success or failure of basic construction, we must pay attention to this issue and study how to achieve correct and thorough design. This is the responsibility of all of us.

　　怎样才能做好工程设计？
    东北煤矿管理局副工程师  许文实
    一  正确认识工程设计的重要
    人民日报自六月十六日发表《没有工程设计就不可能施工》的社论后，连续刊载了许多没有周密设计，或根本没有设计就动工的基本建设工程的失败例子。我们看后真是触目惊心。这些论文和报道，值得我们从事基本建设的人员好好学习。我们今后万不能再犯这样的错误，使国家蒙受损失。
    有的人认为工程设计极易，突击一下就可以完成。结果，设计考虑不周，施工完全失败；或者施工中间时时改变设计，屡次返工，浪费了国家的资材，延长了工程所需的时日。又有人认为设计极难，客观条件不够，人员又少，任务既重，时间又急迫，设计不周可以原谅。这些都是不正确的看法。
    事实上，工程设计是一件非常细致复杂的综合性工作，牵涉甚广。在设计前要尽量收集一切有关资料，经过详细调查、研究、分析，结合理论与经验，作出数个技术的及经济的方案，加以比较，然后选出最经济且切合实际情形的一个，做成设计，制出施工图，方能作为施工的依据。
    所有的工程设计均应合理地利用一切建筑物及设备，并要尽量保证有较高的劳动生产率、低的成本，符合保安规程，造成优越的劳动条件，且能合理地运用基本建设费用。
    工程设计不佳，不但建设时浪费经费，而且影响以后数十年的生产，对将来的建设会起坏的作用，直接影响国家工业化的进程。所以工程设计是基本建设中最基本的一环，它的重要性不容忽视。
    二  做好工程设计的基本方法
    甲，没有正确的设计原始资料就不可能设计
    大家都知道：没有调查研究，就没有发言权。设计更是这样。如果没有设计原始资料或没有正确的资料，就不能进行设计。否则，便是盲目的设计。人民日报发表的例子中，很多都是无根据而设计，有的则根据的资料不正确，所以失败了。正确的设计原始资料，有一部分是设计机构自己去搜集，但大部分还要由委托者供给。为了资料的正确，供给设计原始资料的单位及人员，均须签字盖章，负责资料无误。
    设计原始资料包括甚广，视设计的对象而不同，主要的为建厂区域的经济及工业特征、气候、地形、工程地质、公路、铁路、动力、上下水道、原材料供应及资源情况等。这些资料在设计前可由设计机构组成一个资料搜集队，以总工程师为首，前往施工地点调查收集。过去有些人只凭经验设计，现在则绝对要有正确的根据。如建筑地点一定要有地下水、土壤情况及承载力的资料；开井区域一定要先把埋藏量调查清楚，才能开始设计。如此虽可能延迟基本建设工程的开工，但保证了不致盲目设计与盲目施工。
    乙，设计任务应提早决定，调查勘测应提早进行
    设计需要一个相当长的时间。尤其在我们设计人员缺少，过去又无经验的今日，一切都须从头做起，更需要较长的时间。正常的设计分为三个阶段。即基本设计，技术设计与施工图。由搜集设计原始资料起，至绘出施工图，连审核批准的时间在内，一个总体设计（如建设矿井，建筑大工厂等）约需一年至两年。如果设计原始资料不足，还须补充调查钻探，则时间更将拖长。据苏联的设计经验，设计一个日产两三千吨煤的竖井，只基本设计即需各种设计人员三、四十人，工作两月；技术设计则需设计人员一百人，工作六个月；描图及其他工作人员尚未计算在内。因此设计任务应提早决定，以便按照设计程序周密进行，避免突击性的设计。
    很显然的，调查勘测工作应在设计开始前完成，以便供给正确的设计原始资料。但调查勘测工作不是短时期所能完成的，有的地方有时更受天时的影响，只能在一定时期内进行工作。普通一块煤田，同地质调查到钻探，算清埋藏量，在最好的条件下也得两年。修筑水库或运河的地方，也得经过长时间的调查及勘测。就是大建筑物的地基，还得经过钻探及分析土壤。这一切均需要相当长的时间。因此，调查勘测工作应较建设工作提早数年进行。
            丙，决定设计方针时应作长期打算
    决定设计方针时，应考虑深远，不能眼光短小，只顾到眼前的利益，以致后来事业逐步发展，欲扩充而不能。这不但在都市设计，工厂设计中是如此，就是设计一个矿井，也要考虑到将来另外开井时的连系问题，及需要增产时的办法。
  丁，新的设计或创造要经过试制阶段
    无论任何设计或创造，在最初很难尽善尽美，必须经过试制，改正其缺点，取得经验后，方能建设或制造，始不会失败。东北某机械厂在试制空气压缩机时，未好好取得试制经验，结果大量制造时蒙受损失，便是一个极明显的例子，所以这个原则必须遵守。
            戊，设计图纸完成后应严格检查，施工当中设计机构应经常派人
        检查
    为了避免各设计部分连络不足及绘图的错误，与设计中所用材料机械配备是否合乎标准，设计机构内应建立严格的检查制度，由专人负责检查每张图纸，无错误时方能发出。苏联对于此点很注意，它的设计机构内设有标准科，专办理此事。
    为了监督施工是否按照设计进行，在施工中设计机构应经常派人检查，这样除可免除工程失败时，施工与设计双方互相推卸责任外，并可根据现场实际情况，与施工部门取得密切连系，研究设计得失，以改正不合理的设计，方能日渐进步。
            三  机构和制度应有的改进
            甲，应集中全国设计人员的力量
    过去中国的工程设计很多是由帝国主义者包办，不让中国人参加，所以中国设计人员一向很少。而且设计是理论与经验的结合，一个设计人员不但业务理论需要很高，并应有实际施工经验。因此，在质量上的要求应是很高的。据苏联的经验，培养一个煤矿设计人员需要三年的时间。所以，设计人员在目前恐不易大量补充。就是这样少的人员，现在还是分散各地，有的除设计外还要兼做其他业务，而且有些工作彼此重复。有的地方则因人少，大的设计无法进行；有的地方需要设计又无设计人员。为了补救这些缺点，最有效地运用这些设计人员，最好集中全国设计人员，接受全国各部门的基本建设设计。
            乙，应统一工程名词制定工程规范及标准设计
    中国工程界除一部分外，多无统一的工程名词，明明是一件东西，而叫法各异，这对工程进步是一个阻碍。应由设计机构把大家习用的名称汇集一起，给以恰当的名称后，再由工程界权威人士组成委员会审查后公布采用。工程规范也是各有不同，留日的一套，留美的一套，对中国国情均不完全适合，设计也就没有一定的标准，应由设计机构参照苏联先进经验及本国国情制成草案，亦由工程界组成委员会审查后公布之。为了实施计划经济，节省设计人力起见，应制出若干标准型式的设计，以供给相同条件下的工程采用，且可作为技术工作者的参考。这些当然不是短时期能够完成的，但这些完成后，设计将较现在容易得多，且可加速设计及减少设计费用。
            丙，设计机构应与学术机关、研究机关及制造厂商取得密切连系
    设计中常会遇到某种专门问题，只就设计机构本身的人力与设备，有时无法解决，或不能迅速解决，需委托学术机关或研究机关代为研究试验，所以彼此间应有密切连系。同时学术机关及研究机关有新的发现或研究结果时，亦应通知设计机构。制造厂家与设计机构更应密切连络，设计者应知道那家制造厂能制造什么，生产能力如何，遇有新的产品时，且应及时通知设计机构，以备采用。这样，设计工作才能逐步前进。
            丁，国产机械及材料应普遍进行质量试验
    现在设计中感到的最大困难之一，就是许多国产机械及材料缺乏质量试验结果，规格性能亦不够详尽，以致设计时不敢采用，或无法采用，就是采用时，为安全起见，亦只能用较高的安全系数。这是不妥当的，不经济的。希望今后生产各种产品及材料的机构皆公布其产品质量性能，以便采用。
            戊，应实行优良设计奖励制度
    为提高设计质量，可仿苏联办法，每个设计完成后，审核批准时，应有一审查委员会，审查其内容，如评定该设计优良时，可给与设计者以奖金；如评为中等，则无奖金；评为不良时，且须重新设计。评论标准应以设计内容为主，设计时间为辅。审查委员会应有设计总工程师及专家参加。
            四  设计人员的思想认识问题
            甲，以大胆负责的态度本着工程原则进行设计
    根据已发表的例子，感到设计人员的思想中有三种偏差：一种是设计太大，犯了铺张病，不顾或不了解现在条件的需要，结果延长建设时期，浪费国家投资，或者积压国家资金。一种是不顾设计条件如何，资料够不够，无原则地迁就委托者。另一种则是由于“明哲保身”的旧思想作祟，怕工程失败后负责任，设计时便尽量坚固，安全系数用得很大，失去工程要经济的原则，这同样是给国家浪费了资材。我们今后应坚决与这类思想作斗争，以实事求是、大胆负责的态度，本着工程原则进行设计。
    第一种偏差，只要去掉“杰作思想”，在设计前详细调查研究，仔细考虑问题，即可改正。第二种偏差，只要设计人员坚持不进行盲目设计，及根据工程原则设计，亦可避免。委托者有意见时，则应详细将利害说明，定能得到同意。第三种偏差，除设计人员去掉“雇佣观点”而以主人翁态度设计外，并应早日作出国产机械材料的质量说明及工程规范，才能彻底改正。
            乙，彻底明了自己的设计能力
    基本建设是百年大计，应慎重设计。设计人员应彻底了解自己的能力，遇到问题不能解决时，还是多查查书，多问问群众，多调查研究。不要自以为是，或根本自己都无把握时，就设计出去，一推了之，自欺欺人。
            丙，设计时应尽量利用国产器材
    现在设计中仍有一部分人爱用国外定货。这一方面是由于国内无此种产品，另一方面即有这种产品，但缺乏性能及规格的详尽说明，同时效率不如外国货高，或者质量低，价格高。为设计方便、安全，遂不喜用国货。这对单独一件工程是好的，但从发展整个国家工业出发，则不妥当。比方说矿山上需要一个一千千瓦的电动机，因国内无产品，便始终向国外定货，那我们的电工厂便永远无机会制出这类电动机，也永远得不到经验。我建议今后的设计，凡国内能产的器材，都用国货，除实在不能制造的，方向国外定货。这是个原则问题，同时制造厂家也必须设法提高质量，保证质量。
          丁，努力提高自己的政治及业务水平
    设计人员过去大部分都是单纯技术观点，自命清高，脱离群众，相信自己的一套经验。解放后经过学习，政治水平虽逐渐提高，但仍应加紧政治学习，脱胎换骨，改造自己，真正做到全心全意为人民服务，才跟得上新中国的设计要求。我们业务方面也处处感到落伍，不足以适应新的需要，应加紧学习苏联的先进经验及最新技术。因此，设计人员的学习是应当政治与业务并重。
    在目前，设计的确是个艰巨而繁重的工作，但我们不能畏难，必须加强学习，改善组织，改变工作方法，坚持作到每一项建设都有正确的工程设计。苏联十月革命后，设计也是毫无基础，当时的环境比我们现在坏得多，那时他们只能向他们的敌人学习。但我们现在却有我们的友邦苏联协助，这是我们一个有利的条件。只要我们肯干，定能克服困难，获得相当成绩。
    过去已开工而无正确设计的建设工程，除有特别错误必须停止外，其余应审慎进行，并加速作出正确设计。尚未兴工的建设工程，如无正确设计，则应暂缓动工。
    设计工作既关系着基本建设的成败，则我们必须重视这个问题，研究怎样才能作到正确的周密的设计，这是我们大家的责任。
