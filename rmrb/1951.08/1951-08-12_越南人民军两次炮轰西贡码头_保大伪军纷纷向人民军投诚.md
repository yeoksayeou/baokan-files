Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, August 8th: The Viet Nam People's Army shelled the Saigon docks on the evening of July 6th. Saigon is the largest city in southern Viet Nam. The People's Army hit several warehouses, killing some of the French troops guarding the docks. This was the second time in ten days that the Viet Nam People's Army had shelled the French-held Saigon docks.

Xinhua News Agency: Bao Dai puppet troops are defecting to the Viet Nam People's Army in increasing numbers. In My Tho province, southwest of Saigon in South Viet Nam, in the second half of June alone, approximately 200 puppet troops defected to the Viet Nam People's Army, bringing weapons and ammunition with them. Recently, units of puppet troops stationed in Darlac province in south central Viet Nam and Thu Dau Mot province north of Saigon in South Viet Nam killed their French officers before defecting to the Viet Nam People's Army with their weapons.

The successive revolts of the Bao Dai puppet troops have greatly alarmed the French colonialists. In some French strongholds, the French disarm the puppet troops every night. On the night of June 13, French troops in Cai Lay city, My Tho province, South Viet Nam, fearing the puppet troops stationed in Phu Duc village (transliteration) would escape, bombarded them with mortars, killing a puppet troop platoon leader and one soldier, and seriously wounding six other soldiers. This incident has aroused serious dissatisfaction among the puppet troops in that province and neighboring provinces.

　　越南人民军两次炮轰西贡码头
    保大伪军纷纷向人民军投诚
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社西贡八日讯：越南人民军于七月六日晚炮击西贡码头。西贡是越南南部最大的城市。人民军击中货栈数处，击毙守卫码头的法军一部。这是十天内越南人民军第二次炮轰法军据守的西贡码头。
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：保大傀儡军士兵正越来越多地向越南人民军投诚。仅在南越西贡西南方美荻省一省，六月下半月就有约二百名傀儡军士兵携带武器和弹药向越南人民军投诚。驻中越南部多乐省和南越西贡北方首油没省的傀儡军各一部，最近打死了他们的法国军官，然后携武器向越南人民军投诚。
    保大傀儡军的纷纷反正，使法国殖民者十分惊慌。在一些法军据点里，法军每天晚上都解除傀儡军的武装。六月十三日晚，南越美荻省丐礼市的法军，因害怕驻富端村（译音）的傀儡军逃亡，用迫击炮轰击他们，击毙傀儡军排长和兵士各一名，另有士兵六名受重伤。这一事件已激起该省和邻近各省傀儡军的严重不满。
