To the Editors:

　　Cai Wenqi, the manager of Caiji Shoe Store in Market Street, Tenth District, outside Chaoyangmen, Beijing, often mistreats his apprentices. Caiji Shoe Store currently employs four workers and two apprentices. Cai Wenqi makes the workers and apprentices eat raw corn buns and sorghum rice with cold water added every two or three days, causing them to frequently get sick. The workers and apprentices work eighteen hours a day (from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM), and do not get adequate rest, causing them to doze off at noon. When Cai Wenqi sees workers dozing off, he starts scolding them; when he sees apprentices dozing off, he starts hitting them.

　　Apprentice Sun Hai (15 years old) has been beaten five times in the three months since he arrived at the store this April. The first time was because Cai Wenqi asked him to organize the shoe cabinets, and Cai said Sun's response was too quiet, so he slapped him twice. The subsequent four beatings were all caused by dozing off at noon due to the excessive working hours. The beatings are very cruel, sometimes slapping the face, sometimes kicking. While beating and kicking, he would also scold: "Look at you, like a rabbit, go hide in a hole and sleep." Sun Hai receives no money while working as an apprentice at Caiji Shoe Store, and his clothes all come from his family. Sun Hai's family is very poor, and sometimes he doesn't have clothes to wear, but Cai Wenqi never cares.

　　Another apprentice, Zhao Huaiqing (14 years old), has been beaten six or seven times in the half month since he arrived at Caiji Shoe Store this July. Worker Zhu Ziliang said: "In the four days I've been at Caiji Shoe Store, I personally witnessed Zhao Huaiqing being beaten twice." One day, a cadre from the district people's government came to Caiji Shoe Store to buy shoes, and Cai asked for a price twice as high as other shoe stores. The district cadre didn't buy them and left. Cai said to the workers, "I get angry when I see them (referring to the district cadres), they can't afford shoes at all." The workers asked Cai, "The district cadres don't bother you, why are you doing this?" Cai said, "They can't execute me!" Cai Wenqi's illegal behaviors, such as infringing on human rights and oppressing workers and apprentices, are intolerable. We hope the People's Government will punish him.

　　北京朝阳门外蔡记鞋铺工徒
    控诉该店经理经常打骂学徒
    编辑同志：
    北京市朝阳门外十区市场街蔡记鞋铺经理蔡文启，经常虐待学徒。蔡记鞋铺现在共雇用工人四名，学徒二名，蔡文启三天两头叫工徒们吃生窝窝头，吃高粱米饭时添上冷水，因此工人、学徒常常生病。工人和学徒每天做十八个钟头的工作（从早六点到晚十二点），得不到应有的休息，一到中午就打盹。蔡文启一见工人打盹，出口就骂；一见学徒打盹，动手就打。
    学徒孙海（十五岁）自今年四月到该铺，三个多月挨打过五次。第一次是因为蔡文启叫他整理鞋柜，蔡说孙答应的声音太小，便伸手打了他两个耳光。后来四次挨打都是因为工作时间过长所引起的中午打盹。打是很毒狠的，有时用手打耳光，有时用脚踢。打了踢了还骂着说：看你像兔子一样，钻进洞里去睡吧。孙海在蔡记鞋铺当学徒，一个钱也拿不到，衣服都是自己从家里拿来的。孙海家中很穷，有时就穿不上衣服，蔡文启从来不管。
    另一学徒赵怀清（十四岁），从今年七月到蔡记鞋铺，半个月的时间就挨过六、七次打。工人朱子良说：我到蔡记鞋铺四天的工夫，就亲眼看见赵怀清挨了两次打。有一天，区人民政府一个干部到蔡记鞋铺买鞋，蔡要的价钱比别的鞋铺高出一倍，这位区干部没买，走了。蔡对工人说：“我看见他们（指区干部）就生气，他根本买不起鞋。”工人对蔡说：“区干部又不碍你的事，你这是为什么？”蔡说：“枪毙不了我！”蔡文启这种侵犯人权、压迫工人、学徒等非法行为，是令人不能容忍的。希望人民政府予以制裁。
