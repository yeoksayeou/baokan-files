　　At the Leipzig and Prague International Fairs
　　Xu Dake
　　In March and late May of this year, our country was invited to participate in the Leipzig Fair in the German Democratic Republic and the Prague Fair in Czechoslovakia for the first time. Throughout the exhibition in both locations, China's pavilion consistently attracted thousands upon thousands of visitors and was unanimously praised by representatives from various countries participating in the fair.

　　In the Leipzig and Prague Fair exhibitions, the layout of the Chinese pavilion, both in content and form, possessed our Chinese national characteristics. Upon entering the Chinese pavilion, every visitor was drawn in by the giant, colorful, enlarged photograph of Tiananmen. To the right of Tiananmen stood an industrial giant, and to the left stood a young woman holding a dove of peace in both hands, symbolizing that the Chinese people, having seized political power, were building a new life and defending peace. Among a row of fluttering five-star red flags in front of the Tiananmen city wall, hung a huge portrait of Chairman Mao, brightly illuminated by lights. Next to the portrait were two columns of pictures, the left side focusing on economic construction and the right side on the peace movement. Wide stairs were set up under Tiananmen, leading down to a spacious hall. In the hall, our rich agricultural products, native products, and exquisite handicrafts were systematically displayed in glass shelves and display cases. The audience expressed boundless admiration for the distinctive style of our handicrafts—the harmony of colors, the refinement of carvings, and the beauty of forms. Other exhibits such as minerals, industrial products, textiles, and furs also received good reviews from the audience. Regarding special export products, there was a prominent introduction in the venue, fully depicting the political outlook and rich resources of the new China. In front of each exhibit, large numbers of spectators could be seen stopping and engaging in discussions around the products. They admired the abundance and richness of Chinese mineral resources; they praised our porcelain, silk, and carpets; they were even more impressed by the great achievements of Chinese industry. Many people who visited the Chinese pavilion felt as if they had been to China. Among the 3.5 million visitors in the two locations, almost everyone had visited the Chinese pavilion. Some came from afar specifically to visit the Chinese pavilion; others visited the Chinese pavilion no less than five or six times. A German female translator, Ms. Stuttford, said: "Visiting the Chinese pavilion is truly a pleasant enjoyment; those beautiful ivory carvings and Xiang embroidery paintings are difficult to describe in words. The German Democratic Republic is proud to be friends with such a great new China." In the opinion books of the Chinese pavilion, visitors filled them with sentences of love and praise for the new China; newspapers in both locations hailed the Chinese pavilion as one of the best exhibitions in the history of the fair.

　　Leaving the Chinese pavilion, the audience felt as if they had attended a lesson in Chinese geography. They realized the richness of China's resources and the greatness of its potential power, thereby boosting their confidence in the cause of peace. In Leipzig, a German farmer said: "In the struggle to complete the Five-Year Plan and for the peaceful, democratic reunification of all of Germany, we have increased confidence in victory because we have a strong and resource-rich Chinese friend." The *Neues Deutschland* wrote: "This exhibition makes every visitor from the East and West—regardless of their political beliefs—feel that China is an extremely powerful force for peace." Prague newspapers also commented: "China possesses almost every kind of raw material, resource, agricultural product, and produce." West African blacks, Indonesian students, and Italian workers expressed their joy after visiting the Chinese pavilion, which increased their confidence in their struggles.

　　Audiences also praised the rapid progress of China after liberation, considering it beyond their previous expectations. In the Leipzig exhibition hall, people often stood in front of the pictures of railway repairs and the samples of steel ball bearings, recognizing with astonishment and admiration how the Chinese people were actively working for their country and for peace with the labor enthusiasm of masters. Mason Waglau said: "The exhibition of the People's Republic of China tells us how excellent the achievements can be of a nation liberated from capitalist exploitation." Teacher Hahne said: "The achievements that a nation recovering from major war wounds can achieve in peaceful construction have been indicated by the Chinese pavilion." A French journalist stated: "Let them build for two more years, and the world will change."

　　Visitors unanimously recognized that the great victory of the Chinese people and the achievements they have made in construction are inseparable from the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. They all expressed infinite respect for Chairman Mao. Many people requested the Chinese delegation to pay their respects to Chairman Mao and the Chinese people. Many viewers said, "China has suffered years of war damage, and national liberation has not been long. Now, while supporting our Korean brothers, we have also achieved such great achievements in construction, which is truly exciting." In the venue, one could often see spectators holding our comrades' hands tightly, too moved to speak for a long time.

　　In the past, some Europeans thought that China was a very backward agricultural country, but this concept has now been completely changed. This time, they saw with their own eyes the finished products of China's light and heavy industries and the technical level after liberation, and they were all surprised and admired. Reinhardt, a student from Leipzig, said: "Not long ago, what many people knew about China was still the records of Marco Polo's time. When we saw this exhibition with our own eyes, we were truly ashamed." The audience repeatedly expressed amazement at the precision machinery and measuring instruments exhibited. An Italian textile worker believed that the level of China's textile industry had surpassed theirs, and some light industrial products were also considered to be superior to those of other countries. Many textile experts hoped to exchange technical experience with China, and many workers and students expressed their willingness to come to China to study and work. The *Neues Deutschland* wrote: "Workers in various industrial sectors, members of the Youth League, and merchants from West Germany are all staring in amazement at the large rubber wheels, wires, electrical and steel products exhibited by China. Not long ago, in their minds, China was a vague impression intertwined with silk, tea bricks, difficult-to-write Chinese characters, and sweating coolies. Now they see Chinese exhibits for themselves and feel that 475 million people are industrializing their country at a tremendous speed." Audiences in Prague also expressed similar opinions.

　　Because of this exhibition, the people of Germany and Czechoslovakia have a clearer understanding of the true face of the new China, which has strengthened the friendship between the Chinese and German and Chinese and Czech people. Ms. Bourdon, a teacher from Leipzig, said: "The Chinese pavilion gives me a strong impression. For children who are growing up, we must explain to them the meaning of world peace and plant the seeds of cooperation with progressive nations in their hearts." Workers in the Mao Zedong Group of a certain factory felt the importance of international friendship even more after seeing the Chinese pavilion. Many viewers looked at Chairman Mao's photo and asked about Chairman Mao's health with concern. They happily said, "With Chairman Mao, it is not only the happiness of the Chinese people, but also our happiness."

　　The various pictures of our Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, bravely striking at the American aggressors, defending world peace, and our people's enthusiastic movement to resist America and aid Korea were universally respected at the fair. Leipzig citizen Schwarz said: "The Volunteers saved the crisis of American imperialism attempting to conquer the world. Salute to the Chinese People's Volunteers." A worker said: "A nation fighting for freedom is invincible." In Prague, the pictures of the Chinese people resisting America and aiding Korea were the most popular among the audience.

　　In the exhibitions in both locations, our country provided systematic and prominent introductions to special export products, thus providing the possibility of exporting various materials. Therefore, it also played a certain role in facilitating trade. Many viewers requested China to supply silk, peanuts, rice, tea, cigarettes, minerals, etc. Industrialists and businessmen from various countries are even more eager to have frequent exchanges with China. During the exhibition period in Leipzig, merchants from West Germany and capitalist countries often came to discuss trade, totaling more than 60 on-the-spot negotiations in the venue.

　　Our country's first participation in the Leipzig and Prague Fair exhibitions has given audiences from various countries a deep impression of the vast and resource-rich new China. From this, they have more concretely realized that the great Chinese people, who have forever freed themselves from the shackles of imperialism, are building a free and happy new life with selfless labor enthusiasm and firm confidence under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and are greatly strengthening the forces of the world's peace and democracy camp with the great achievements they have achieved.

　　在来比锡和布拉格国际博览会上
    徐大可
    今年三月间与五月底，我国首次应邀参加了民主德国的来比锡和捷克斯洛伐克的布拉格博览会。在两地的整个展览过程中，我国的展览馆始终吸引着千千万万的观众，并受到参加博览会的各国代表的一致好评。
    在来比锡博览会与布拉格博览会的展出中，中国馆会场的布置，无论在内容上或形式上，都具有着我们中国的民族特色。一走进中国馆，每个观众就被巨幅五彩放大的天安门照片所吸引。天安门的右边屹立着一个工业巨人，左边站着一个双手捧着和平鸽的少女，象征着掌握了政权的中国人民正在建设新的生活与保卫和平。在天安门城墙前一排飘扬的五星红旗中，悬挂着被灯光照得通明的毛主席巨像，巨像下旁贴着两列图片，左侧以经济建设为主，右侧以和平运动为主。天安门下设有宽大楼梯，拾级而下便是宽畅的大会场。会场上以玻璃架和橱台，有系统地陈列着我国丰富的农产、土产以及精美的手工业品。观众对我手工业品的特出风格——色泽的和谐、雕刻的精致和形式的美观，表示无限赞赏。其他如矿产、工业品、纺织品、皮毛等展览品也莫不获得观众的好评。关于出口特产，在会场中更有突出的介绍，充分地描绘出新中国的政治面貌和丰富的蕴藏。在每种展览品前面，随时都可看到大批观众驻足不前，围着产品展开讨论，他们羡慕中国矿产种类的繁多和蕴藏的丰富；他们赞扬我们的瓷器、丝绸和地毯；他们更钦佩中国的工业有了很大的成就。很多人游览了中国馆都有象到过了中国一样的感觉。在两地观众三百五十万人中，几乎没有一个不曾到过中国馆的。有的为了要参观中国馆，特从远道而来；有的来过中国馆不下五、六次。一个德国女翻译员史徒佛丽说：“参观中国馆实在是一种愉快的享受；那些美丽的象牙雕刻和湘绣图画，都难以用文字来形容。德意志民主共和国和这样一个伟大的新中国作了朋友感到骄傲。”在中国馆的几本意见册中，观众填满了对新中国热爱和赞扬的句子；两地报纸更把中国馆誉为是博览会历来最好展出之一。
    走出了中国馆，观众都好象上了一课中国地理一样。他们认识到中国物产的丰富和潜在力量的伟大，因而鼓舞了他们对和平事业的信心。在来比锡，一个德国农民说：“在争取完成五年计划与全德和平民主、统一的斗争中，我们因有强大而且资源丰富的中国朋友而提高了胜利的信心。”《新德意志》报写道：“这次展览对每一个来自东方和西方的参观者——不管他们的政治思想如何——说来都感觉到中国是一个极强大的和平力量。”布拉格的报纸也评称：“不论哪种原料，资源，农产及出产，中国几无所不有。”西非黑人，印度尼西亚学生，意大利工人参观中国馆后，都表示欣慰，增加了他们斗争的信心。
    对解放后的中国飞跃进步，观众们更赞叹不止，都认为是出于他们以前所意料的。在来比锡展览会场中，常有人在修复铁路的图片前，在钢珠轴承的样品前，用惊异和敬佩的心情来认识中国人民是如何地以主人翁的劳动热情来为祖国为和平而积极工作。泥瓦工人华格劳说：“中华人民共和国的展览告诉我们：一个民族从资本主义的剥削下解放出来就会有如何优异的成绩。”教员哈能说：“一个从重大战争创伤中恢复过来的民族，能够在和平建设中所达到的成就，已由中国馆指示出来。”一个法国记者表示：“再让他们建设两年，世界就要改观了。”
    参观者一致认识到：中国人民的伟大胜利与在建设中所获得的成就，是与伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席的领导分不开的，他们都对毛主席表示无限的敬仰，许多人要求中国代表团向毛主席和中国人民致敬。很多观众说：“中国受了多年战争的破坏，全国解放也还不久，现在一面支援朝鲜兄弟，同时在建设上又有了这样伟大的成就，真使人兴奋。”在会场里常常可以看到观众们紧握着我们同志的手，激动得很久，才说出话来。
    过去有些欧洲人认为中国是一个非常落后的农业国，这一观念现在是完全改变过来了。这次他们亲眼看到中国轻重工业的成品及解放后的技术水平，都感到惊讶与钦佩。来比锡的学生来因哈特说：“在不久以前，多少人所知道的中国情形，还是马可孛罗时代的记载。当我们亲眼看到这次的展览，真使我们感到羞愧。”观众对展出的精密机件和测量器具一再表示惊佩，一个意大利的纺织工人认为中国纺织工业水平已超过了他们，有些轻工业品也被认为已凌驾他国之上。很多纺织专家希望与中国交换技术经验，很多工人和学生更表示愿意到中国来学习工作。《新德意志》报写着：“各产业部门的工人、青年团员以及从西德来的商人，都以惊异的眼光注视中国展出的大橡胶车轮，电线，电气及钢铁制品。不久以前在他们心目中，中国是个和真丝、茶砖、难写的方块字以及汗流夹背的苦力等交织在一起的模糊的印象，现在他们自己看到了中国的展览品感到四亿七千五百万人民正以极大的速度进行着他们国家的工业化。”在布拉格的观众也同样表示了这些类似的意见。
    由于这次的展出，德、捷两国人民更清楚地认识了新中国的真实面貌，更加强了中德与中捷人民的友谊。来比锡的女教员伯德恩说：“中国馆给我强烈的印象，对于正在长大的儿童们，我们更要向他们说明世界爱好和平的意义，要在他们心内种下和进步民族合作的种籽。”某工厂毛泽东小组工人看了中国馆后更感到国际友谊的重要性。有很多观众看了毛主席的照片，亲切地询问毛主席的健康，他们高兴地说：“有了毛主席，不但是中国人民的幸福，也是我们的幸福。”
    我国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，英勇打击美国侵略者，保卫世界和平以及我国人民热烈的抗美援朝运动的各种图片，在博览会上受到一致的崇敬。来比锡市民史瓦池说：“志愿军挽救了美帝国主义企图征服世界的危机，向中国人民志愿军致敬。”一个工人说：“一个为自由而斗争的民族是不可征服的。”在布拉格，中国人民抗美援朝的图片最受观众们的欢迎。
    在两地的展览中，我国对出口特产都有了系统、突出的介绍，因而提供了多方面出口物资的可能性。所以在沟通贸易上也起了一定的作用，很多观众要求中国供给丝绸、花生、大米、茶叶、香烟、矿产等。各国工商业家更热烈地希望与中国经常往来。在来比锡展出期中，且常有西德及资本主义国家的商人来洽谈贸易，总计在会场中当场洽谈者就有六十多起。
    我国首次参加来比锡与布拉格博览会的展出，已使各国观众对于地大物博的新中国有了一个深刻印象。他们由此已经更具体地认识到：永远摆脱了帝国主义束缚的伟大的中国人民，在中国共产党与毛主席的领导之下，正以忘我的劳动热情与坚强的信心，建设着自由幸福的新生活，并且以他们所获得的伟大成就，大大地加强着世界和平民主阵营的力量。
