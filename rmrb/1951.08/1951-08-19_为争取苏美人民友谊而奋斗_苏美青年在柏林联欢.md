    Soviet and American Youth Gather in Berlin
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, Eighteenth] TASS, Berlin: The Soviet youth delegation participating in the World Youth and Student Festival for Peace held a gathering with the American youth delegation on the 16th.
    Struchkova, a dancer from the Moscow Grand Theatre, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the Soviet youth at the gathering. Subsequently, many American youths spoke, expressing their love for the Soviet people. An American young woman said in her speech: American youth, both white and Black, warmly salute Soviet youth. The example of Soviet youth has inspired American youth to actively engage in the struggle to defend peace. She then compared the Soviet Union's post-war peace policy with the United States' expansionist policy, and condemned the U.S. government's support for the Chinese Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, its armed intervention in Korea, and its rearmament of West Germany and Japan. She concluded by emphasizing that American youth are actively participating in the struggle for peace and will intensify their efforts to strive for friendship between the American and Soviet people in order to safeguard lasting world peace.
    An American Black artist delivered a speech at the meeting. His speech was filled with a sense of justice for the cause of peace and a firm belief in the inviolable friendship between the American and Soviet people. He said: To gather with the Soviet youth representatives has given me unparalleled joy for the first time in my life. I speak not only on behalf of the American Black people, but also on behalf of the American working people. His words won warm applause from the entire audience.
    At the meeting, young artists from the Soviet Union and the United States performed musical programs. Finally, the Soviet and American youth sang the "Anthem of the World Federation of Democratic Youth" in unison and shouted: "Friendship! Peace! Stalin!"
