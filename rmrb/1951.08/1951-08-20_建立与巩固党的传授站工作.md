Establishing and Consolidating the Work of Party Transmission Stations
Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

(1) Establishing and strengthening the work of transmission stations is an important part of doing a good job in branch education.

Establishing and strengthening branch education transmission stations is an important link for district committees in doing a good job in branch education. After the Provincial Party Committee issued instructions on rural branch education in 1949, the party committees in many areas attached importance to this work. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-nine counties in six special districts including Shijiazhuang, Tongxian, Baoding, Tangshan, and Handan, 710 transmission stations have been established; the Shijiazhuang Special District alone has 454. Since these areas established and strengthened the work of transmission stations, they have also achieved practical results in carrying out branch education. First of all, because the station heads go deep into the branches to promote learning and solve some of the obstacles to the study of party members, the enthusiasm of party members for learning is increasing day by day, and the number of branches adhering to the party class system has also increased. For example, in the Xihuayuan Village of the First District of Cangxian County, since the establishment of the transmission station half a year ago, it has adhered to the transmission system three times a month, and all nine branches in the station have conducted studies, of which seven branches can study according to the system. In Lingshou County, more than 65 percent of the branches can adhere to the regular study system, more than 25 percent of the branches have not fully adhered to the study system, and less than 10 percent of the branches do not study. Secondly, the branches that have established transmission stations and can adhere to regular study have greatly improved the political consciousness and work enthusiasm of party members. For example, the Yongpingli Branch in the First District of Cangxian County, since its establishment, party members did not pay attention to learning, their thinking became more and more tired, and three party members had declared their intention to withdraw from the party. After the establishment of the transmission station and adherence to study, the station head made criticisms and education targeting the specific thoughts of party members. After party members realized the purpose and far-reaching future of the revolution, their work became active. Thirdly, after the branch education is strengthened, the branch's ability to lead the work is improved, it can implement the party's policies, follow the mass line, and complete the current tasks in a sound manner under the truly conscious and voluntary actions of the masses. For example, the Yongpingli Branch in Cangxian County, in last year's winter conscription work, after the branch's publicity and education, made the masses understand the significance of defending the country and their families, and they all believed that joining the army was glorious. Thirty-two young and strong men volunteered to sign up and won the honorary plaque for conscription work in the entire district. The autumn grain requisition was also completed ahead of schedule and received a prize flag. Of the 102 households in the village, more than 90 households participated in the cooperative, and more than 80 people participated in cultural studies. These are all examples of strengthening branch education, doing a good job in propaganda and mobilization, and smoothly promoting all work.

(2) Several suggestions on establishing and strengthening the work of transmission stations.

From the perspective of the entire province, the number of transmission stations established is still too small, and many of the established stations also have problems and are not functioning. Therefore, great efforts should be made in the establishment and rectification work. How to establish and strengthen the work of transmission stations? Based on the experience of various places, the following issues are raised for reference:

1.  Clarify the nature and tasks of the transmission station so that the station head can take the initiative to carry out the work. The transmission station is a working method led by the district committee's education officer (who does not leave production) to lead and promote the study of party members. The station head should be held by the district committee's education officer. The education officer is a powerful assistant to the district committee in leading and promoting branch education, not a leader at a higher level. The tasks of the station head should be: (1) To gather branch propaganda committee members and branch teachers to the transmission station to study on a regular basis, report on branch education work, and study teaching methods. Lead the establishment and adherence to all systems of the transmission station. (2) When the district committee cannot go to the station to teach party classes, the station head is responsible for teaching. (3) To be responsible for supervising and guiding the study of each branch in a planned manner, and to help branches that do not have branch teachers or whose branch teachers are too weak to teach classes. According to the above tasks, the qualifications of the station head should be that they can read through general teaching materials, can explain the teaching materials after being trained or after being taught by the district committee, and are upright in their thinking and work style and have relatively high prestige among party members. In order to enable the station head to do the above work well without hindering production, it is appropriate to establish a transmission station for every five or six branches, and the distance between each branch and the station is generally no more than six li. In mountainous areas where villages are small and scattered, one or two deputy station heads can be added. Branches that are too far away from the transmission station should not be forced to organize lectures at the station, and cadres who are detached from production by the district committee can go to teach classes. The station head does not hold other positions concurrently and generally does not add to their work tasks.

2.  In order for the transmission station to give full play to its role, necessary systems should be established. The content of branch education can be transmitted two or three times a month, and the date and time of transmission should be fixed so that people who come to the station to listen to lectures can arrange their work and production in advance. The transmission dates of transmission stations in a district should be staggered so that county and district cadres can inspect and help. In addition, each village branch should fix the branch propaganda committee members and branch teachers to attend the lectures, not branch committee members in turn, in order to prevent the phenomenon of mutual procrastination and delaying learning. Party members of the branches in the village where the transmission station is established can all participate in the lectures. In order to consolidate the work of the transmission station and establish a regular system for branch education, each transmission station should gradually establish systems for registration, reporting, leave, make-up classes, examinations, and station heads to inspect learning at the village branch. If the district committee has assigned fixed persons to be responsible for the transmission work of each station, it must also notify the station head in advance if it cannot go to the station on time due to business, so that the station head can replace the transmission. If time permits, the district committee can help the station head to prepare for the lectures.

The establishment of the above system must go through democratic discussions in each village branch to clear up ideas so that everyone consciously abides by it. However, the key to adhering to the system lies first in the exemplary role and earnest grasp of the station head and the district committee. Those who do not abide by the system should be ordered to make a review and criticism should be made to seek improvement and effective implementation.

3.  Strengthening the leadership of the transmission station and improving the working ability of the station head is the primary key to doing a good job in the transmission station. Therefore, the county and district committees should often understand and help the station head solve the difficulties in their work, and the district committee should establish a regular leadership system, regularly convene the station head to report and deploy work. The county party committee can hold two or three station head meetings a year to exchange work experience, convey educational content, select work models and reward them so that the work of the transmission station can be continuously consolidated and improved.

　　建立与巩固党的传授站工作
    中共河北省委宣传部
    （一）建立与加强传授站工作，是作好支部教育工作的重要一环
    建立与加强支部教育传授站，是区委作好支部教育工作的重要环节。省委在一九四九年发布农村支部教育指示后，不少地区的党委重视了这一工作。目前据石家庄、通县、保定、唐山、邯郸等六个专区的二十九个县不完全的统计，已经建立起七百一十个传授站；只石家庄专区就有四百五十四个。这些地区自从建立与加强了传授站工作，在进行支部教育工作上，也收到了实际效果。首先是由于站长深入支部推动学习，解决了一些党员学习的障碍，党员的学习情绪一天比一天的高涨起来，坚持党课制度的支部也增加了。如沧县一区西花园村，建立传授站半年以来，坚持了每月三次的传授制度，全站九个支部都进行了学习，其中七个支部能按制度学习。灵寿县百分之六十五以上的支部能坚持经常的学习制度，百分之二十五以上的支部还没有完全坚持学习制度，不学习的支部不到百分之十。其次，是建立了传授站又能坚持经常学习的支部，大大地提高了党员的政治觉悟和工作情绪。如沧县一区永平里支部，自建党以来，党员不注意学习，思想越来越疲塌，并且有三个党员曾声明要退党。建立了传授站，坚持了学习，站长针对党员的具体思想作了批判和教育，党员认识到革命的目的与远大前途后，工作都积极起来。第三是支部教育加强后，支部领导工作的能力提高了，能贯彻党的政策，走好群众路线，在群众真正自觉自愿的行动下健全地完成了当前的工作任务。如沧县永平里支部，在去年冬季参军工作中，经过支部的宣传教育，使群众明白了保家卫国的意义，都认为参军光荣，三十二个青壮年自动报名，荣获全区参军工作的光荣匾。秋征又提前完成了任务，得到奖旗。全村一百零二户中，有九十多户参加了合作社，八十多人参加了文化学习。这些都是加强了支部教育，作好宣传鼓动工作，使一切工作顺利推进的实例。
    （二）建立与加强传授站工作的几点意见
    从全省来看，建立传授站的数目还太少，已建立的站也有不少的存在着问题，不起作用。因此，在建立与整顿工作上还应作很大的努力。怎样建立与加强传授站工作呢？根据各地的经验，提出以下几个问题，以供参考：
    一、明确传授站的性质与任务，使站长能主动地进行工作。传授站是区委教育干事（不脱离生产的）领导与推动党员学习的一种工作方法，站长应由区委教育干事担任，教育干事是区委领导与推动支部教育的有力助手，不是一级领导。站长的任务应是：（一）按期集合支部宣传委员与支部教员到传授站学习，汇报支部教育工作，研究教学方法。领导建立与坚持传授站的一切制度。（二）区委不能到站传授党课时，站长负责传授。（三）有计划地负责督促和指导各支部的学习，帮助没有支部教员或支部教员能力太弱的支部上课。根据以上任务，站长的条件应是能念通一般的教材，经过训练或经过区委传授后能讲解教材，思想作风正派，在党员中比较有威信的党员。为使站长作好以上工作，又不妨碍生产，应以五、六个支部建立一个传授站为适宜，各支部距站一般不超过六里地。山区村小又分散，可增设一、二个副站长。离传授站太远的支部，不要勉强组织到站听讲，可由区委会脱离生产的干部去上课。站长不另兼其他职务，一般的不另增添他的工作任务。
    二、为了使传授站充分发挥作用，应当建立必要的制度。每月可传授二、三次支部教育内容，要固定传授日期和时间，以便使到站听讲的人事先将工作和生产安排好。一个区内传授站的传授日期要岔开，以便于县、区干部检查与帮助。另外，各村支部应固定由支部宣传委员与支部教员到站听课，不是支委轮流，以便防止互相推拖而耽误学习的现象发生。建立传授站村的支部党员可全体参加听课。为了巩固传授站的工作，使支部教育形成定期的制度，各传授站应逐步建立登记、汇报、请假、补课、考试和站长到村支部检查学习等制度。区委如已经分工固定负责各站的传授工作，到期因事不能到站时，也必须事先通知站长，以便使站长代替传授，如时间许可，区委可帮助站长作好讲课的准备工作。
    建立以上制度，必须经过各村支部的民主讨论，打通思想，以便使大家自觉遵守。但是坚持制度的关键首先在于站长和区委的以身作则和认真掌握。遇有不遵守制度的，应令其检讨并提出批评，以求改进和切实贯彻。
    三、加强对传授站的领导，提高站长的工作能力，是作好传授站工作的首要关键。因此，县、区委应经常了解和帮助站长解决工作中的困难，区委并应建立经常的领导制度，定期召集站长汇报布置工作。县委每年可召开两、三次站长会议，交流工作经验，传达教育内容，评选工作模范并进行奖励，以便使传授站工作，不断地巩固与提高。
