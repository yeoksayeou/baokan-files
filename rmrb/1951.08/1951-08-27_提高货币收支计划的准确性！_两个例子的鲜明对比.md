　　Improve the Accuracy of Monetary Revenue and Expenditure Plans!
　　——A Sharp Contrast Between Two Examples
    Carefully preparing monetary revenue and expenditure plans plays a significant role in strengthening cash management and promoting the planned nature of the national economy. Over the past six months, enterprises, government agencies, military units, cooperatives, and other entities have universally formulated revenue and expenditure plans.
    A relatively common shortcoming in the current monetary revenue and expenditure plans of various units is their lack of accuracy. The planned figures often exceed the actual revenue and expenditure figures. For example, in the Northwest Region this year, the cash expenditure for February accounted for only 23% of the original plan. This resulted in a large amount of cash being frozen by the state bank, preventing it from being rationally used for national defense, economic, cultural, and other construction projects, leading to a serious waste of cash. At the same time, it is also difficult for the state bank to plan and control the currency circulation and issuance in various regions, which is detrimental to stabilizing financial prices.
    The reasons for the inaccuracy of revenue and expenditure plans are mainly that some leading cadres of enterprises are accustomed to the supply system's management methods, do not pay attention to the use and turnover of funds, and do not sufficiently understand the significance and role of revenue and expenditure plans. Therefore, they do not value the formulation of revenue and expenditure plans and even treat them as purely technical work, without personally grasping them, and leave them to the accounting staff to compile arbitrarily. Secondly, the lack of precision in the production and operational plans of some departments also affects the accuracy of the monetary revenue and expenditure plans. The importance attached by leading cadres is a crucial key factor.
    Here are two examples, one with a relatively accurate revenue and expenditure plan and one with an inaccurate revenue and expenditure plan. A comparison of the two shows how the accuracy of revenue and expenditure plans can be improved.
    From March of this year to July, the First Branch of the Hongxing Iron Factory in Beijing had extremely inaccurate revenue and expenditure plans. The implementation of the factory's revenue and expenditure plan for the first quarter of this year was as follows: actual revenue accounted for 24.28% of the original plan, and actual expenditure accounted for 20.75% of the original plan. For the revenue and expenditure situation in July: actual revenue accounted for 11.5% of the original plan, and actual expenditure accounted for 18.61% of the original plan.
    Why were the revenue and expenditure plans of the First Branch of the Hongxing Iron Factory so inaccurate? The main reason was the lack of attention from the leadership. The factory's revenue and expenditure plans were compiled in the following way: first, the factory's accountant (who did not have a good understanding of the production and operational situation) compiled it based on estimates, then the factory manager and director looked at it, stamped it, and sent it to the approval authority. To make it easier to withdraw funds, they arbitrarily expanded the plan. Obviously, a revenue and expenditure plan compiled so hastily is formalistic and cannot be accurate. In addition, the shortcomings in the factory's management, such as unscientific division of labor, with the manager, director, and technicians all going out to purchase materials and solicit work, with no one specifically responsible; an unsound accounting system, with some of the accounts for July not yet registered in early August; no monthly production plan, and no budget for management expenses and expenditures, spending whatever was needed; this chaotic state of management also greatly affected the accuracy of the revenue and expenditure plans.
    The revenue and expenditure plan of the Second Factory of the Xinhua Printing Plant is relatively accurate. The implementation of the factory's revenue and expenditure plan from April to July is as follows: the percentage of actual revenue to the original plan was: 86.37% in April, 95% in May, 85% in June, and 114% in July; the percentage of actual expenditure to the original plan was: 93.77% in April, 98.6% in May, 75% in June, and 115% in July.
    Why is the revenue and expenditure plan of the Second Factory of the Xinhua Printing Plant relatively accurate, with the average actual revenue and expenditure for four months reaching over 80% of the original plan? The main reason is that the factory's leading cadres attach great importance to it. At the beginning of formulating the revenue and expenditure plan, the factory director personally convened a meeting of relevant departments to discuss and formulate the revenue and expenditure plan in order to educate cadres to attach importance to it. After the accounting department became familiar with formulating the plan, meetings were no longer held. However, before each revenue and expenditure plan was formulated, the accounting department had to collect material, administrative, and engineering departments' budget estimates for funds, organize them, and refer to the actual revenue and expenditure figures for the previous month. Then, based on the current month's production plan and various expenditure budgets, they conducted research and analysis, prepared a preliminary draft of the revenue and expenditure plan, and sent it to the factory director for review.
    After the revenue and expenditure plan is approved by the higher authorities, it is conscientiously implemented, and a project registration system is established to record the actual revenue and expenditure amounts at any time for comparison with the planned figures. The implementation of the revenue and expenditure plan is checked once every month on the 20th. Here, we can also cite one thing to illustrate the factory's strict implementation of the revenue and expenditure plan. For example, in June, a plan to purchase transformers for 50 million yuan was not implemented because the price was not suitable. Some departments proposed to use the 50 million yuan for other purposes, but the accounting department did not allow it in order to resolutely implement the "special funds for special purposes" system. This spirit of conscientiousness and responsibility in resolutely implementing the system is worth learning from other departments.
    In order to rationally use cash and reduce waste, it is necessary to improve the accuracy of monetary revenue and expenditure plans. From the situation of the Second Factory of the Xinhua Printing Plant, as long as the leading cadres of each unit attach importance to the revenue and expenditure plan and recognize that the revenue and expenditure plan not only plays a significant role in stabilizing financial prices, saving cash, and regulating currency circulation in a planned manner, but also has a significant meaning for promoting the economic accounting of enterprises and the planning of the entire national financial economy. Also, as long as we overcome the supply system mentality and adopt a careful, conscientious, responsible, and strict attitude in the process of formulating and implementing the revenue and expenditure plan, the accuracy of the revenue and expenditure plan can be gradually improved.

　　提高货币收支计划的准确性！
    ——两个例子的鲜明对比
    认真编造货币收支计划，对加强现金管理与促进国家经济的计划性有着重大的作用。半年来各企业、机关、部队、合作社等都已普遍地编制了收支计划。
    目前各单位的货币收支计划中存在一个较普遍的缺点，就是计划不准确，计划数往往大于实际收支数。如西北区今年二月份现金支出数，仅占原计划百分之二十三，这就使国家银行大量现金被冻结，不能合理地用于国防、经济、文化等建设事业，造成现金的严重浪费。同时，国家银行也很难有计划地掌握各地货币流通量与发行量，对稳定金融物价，也是不利的。
    造成收支计划不准确的原因，主要是有些企业的领导干部习惯于供给制的经营方法，不重视资金的运用与周转，对收支计划的意义与作用认识不够；因此，对编造收支计划不重视，甚至把收支计划当做单纯技术工作，自己不亲自掌握，交给会计人员随便乱编。其次是由于有些部门的生产、经营计划尚不精确，也影响到货币收支计划的准确性。其中领导干部的重视与否，是重要的关键。
    这里有两个例子，一个是收支计划比较准确的，一个是收支计划不准确的，从两者的比较中，可以看出收支计划的准确性怎样才能提高。
    北京市宏兴铁工厂第一分厂，从今年三月开始编造收支计划，到七月为止，都极不准确。该厂今年第一季度的收支计划执行情况：实际收入数占原计划百分之二十四点二八，实际支出数占原计划百分之二十点七五；七月份的收支情况：实际收入数占原计划百分之十一点五，实际支出数占原计划百分之十八点六一。
    宏兴铁工厂第一分厂的收支计划为什么极不准确呢？主要是由于领导上不够重视，该厂的收支计划是这样编造出来的：先由该厂会计根据估计（会计对生产、经营情况不甚了解）编造出来，该厂经理、厂长看看盖个章，就送到批审机关，又为了取款方便，就随便扩大计划。很显然，这样草率编造出来的收支计划，是形式主义的，不可能准确的。另外，该厂经营管理上存在的缺点，如分工不科学，经理、厂长、技师都出去采购，揽活，无专人负责；会计制度又不健全，七月的账，八月初有些尚未登记；每月没有生产计划，管理费用和经费开支也没有预算，用多少算多少；这种经营管理上的混乱状态，也大大影响到收支计划的准确性。
    新华印刷厂第二厂的收支计划是比较准确的，该厂从四月到七月收支计划的执行情况如下：实际收入数占原计划的百分比是：四月为百分之八六点三七，五月为百分之九五，六月为百分之八五，七月为百分之一一四；实际支出数占原计划的百分比：四月为百分之九三点七七，五月为百分之九八点六，六月为百分之七五，七月为百分之一一五。
    为什么新华印刷厂第二厂的收支计划比较准确，四个月平均实际收支达原计划百分之八十以上呢？主要原因是该厂领导干部很重视。在编造收支计划之初，该厂厂长为了教育干部重视收支计划，亲自召开有关部门的会议，共同讨论，编造收支计划。当会计部门对编造计划已熟习后，即不再开会。但每次编造收支计划前，会计部门都要搜集材料、事务、工务等有关部门的用款预算，加以整理，同时参照上月度实际收支数字，再根据本月生产计划和各项开支预算加以研究分析，编制收支计划初稿，送厂长审核。
    收支计划经上级批准后，并认真执行，建立项目登记制度，随时记载实际收支金额，以便和计划数核对。每月二十日检查一次收支计划执行情况。这里还可以举出一件事，说明该厂严格执行收支计划的情形，如六月份计划买变压器款项五千万元，因价格不合适未购买，有的部门提出将五千万元挪作他用，会计部门为了坚决执行“专款专用”制度未允。这种坚决执行制度的认真负责精神是值得其他部门学习的。
    为了合理使用现金，减少浪费，必须提高货币收支计划的准确性。从新华印刷厂第二厂的情形来看，只要各单位领导干部重视收支计划，认识到收支计划不仅对稳定金融物价、节省现金、有计划地调节货币流通有重大作用，对促进企业的经济核算与整个国家财政经济的计划上也有重大的意义。又只要在编造收支计划与执行的过程中，克服供给制思想，采取精打细算，认真、负责、严格的态度，收支计划的准确性是可以逐渐提高的。
