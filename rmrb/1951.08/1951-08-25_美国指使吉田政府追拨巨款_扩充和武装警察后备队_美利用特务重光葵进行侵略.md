　　U.S. Instructs Yoshida Government to Allocate Huge Sums
　　Expand and Arm Police Reserve Force
　　U.S. Uses Traitor Koki Hirota to Carry Out Aggression
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo] News: Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese Yoshida government has initially decided to allocate 11 billion yen in a supplementary budget to accelerate the expansion and arming of the Japanese Police Reserve Force. The Reserve Force is currently openly recruiting 10,000 new soldiers and plans to expand its strength to 125,000 men.
　　The Police Reserve Force is already equipped with light and heavy machine guns, carbines, and armored vehicles. It is said that each barracks will soon be allocated many tanks. At a certain barracks in Obihiro, Hokkaido, the Police Reserve Force is receiving training in street fighting, anti-tank warfare, and coastal warfare, and has completed battalion-level training. Their training maintains the same pace as that of the U.S. forces stationed in Hokkaido, and some units are receiving training in night attacks, camping, and regimental exercises. It is said that they are preparing to hold a large-scale exercise at the Narashino parade ground in the suburbs of Tokyo.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 23rd] TASS reported: “Liberation” published an article stating that Koki Hirota, a Class A war criminal of Japan, who was illegally released by the U.S. occupation authorities in November 1950, is the number one U.S. spy in Japan. The plan to reorganize the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is to be implemented after the San Francisco Conference, is being handled by him. This plan stipulates the establishment of a special division under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle relations with South Asian countries, with the intention of establishing a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" with Japan as its leader, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya, Burma, Thailand, and Indochina.
　　The report continued: Hirota maintains close contact with the U.S. occupation authorities, and it is generally believed that he may be a candidate for the future foreign minister in the Japanese government. The report pointed out: Ridgway and Yoshida have now instructed Hirota to quickly draft the final instructions to be issued to the Japanese delegation attending the San Francisco Conference.

　　美国指使吉田政府追拨巨款
    扩充和武装警察后备队
    美利用特务重光葵进行侵略
    【新华社讯】东京消息：在美帝国主义指使下，日本吉田政府已初步决定在追加预算中拨款一百十亿日元，加紧扩充和武装日本警察后备队。后备队现正在公开招募新兵一万名，并准备将后备队实力扩充到十二万五千人。
    警察后备队业已装备有轻重机枪、卡宾枪与装甲车辆。据说每一军营不久即可分配到许多坦克。在北海道带广地方的某军营，警察后备队正在受巷战、反坦克战、海岸战的训练，且已完成了营的训练。他们和驻在北海道的美军的训练保持同样的进程，一部分部队在受着夜袭、宿营以及团的训练。据说他们正准备在东京郊外的习志野阅兵广场举行大规模的演习。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎二十三日讯：“解放报”登载一篇文章说：一九五零年十一月间被美国占领军当局非法释放的日本甲级战犯重光葵，是美国在日本的头号特务。关于准备在旧金山会议后予以实现的重组日本外务省的计划，就是归他办理的。这个计划规定在外务省之下特设一司，专门处理与南亚各国的关系，蓄意建立一个以日本为盟主的“大亚洲共荣圈”，将包括菲律宾、印尼、马来亚、缅甸、泰国和印度支那。
    该报继续说：重光葵与美国占领军当局保持密切接触，一般认为他可能就是未来的日本政府中的外相的候补人。该报指出：李奇微和吉田现在已责成重光葵从速拟订发给出席旧金山会议的日本代表团的训令的定稿。
