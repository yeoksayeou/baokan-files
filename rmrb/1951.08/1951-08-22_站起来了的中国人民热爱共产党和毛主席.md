　　The Chinese People Who Have Stood Up Love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao

    Around the 30th anniversary of the Party, the People's Daily continuously published congratulatory telegrams and letters from people across the country to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In addition, the People's Daily also published the names of people and organizations whose congratulatory telegrams and letters were not published in full; this list has not yet been completed even today.

    These tens of thousands of congratulatory telegrams and letters made me deeply feel how much the Chinese people who have stood up love our great Party and wise Chairman Mao. Our Party represents the interests of the people of the whole country. For thirty years, the Party has always been with the people, fighting resolutely against enemies at home and abroad, and leading the people to build our great motherland. Under the leadership of the Party, the people have shaken off their shackles and begun to live a happy life. These tens of thousands of congratulatory telegrams and letters precisely express the joy, happiness, and love of the people of the whole country for the Party and Chairman Mao; at the same time, they also show the people's determination to defend the fruits of victory and build a happier future with their own practical actions.

    These tens of thousands of congratulatory telegrams and letters tell us that the people of all China are closely united around the Party and Chairman Mao. This is a huge and unparalleled force. This guarantees that we will be able to defeat the aggression of any enemy and that we will be able to complete our construction undertakings. I am a soldier of the People's Navy. I have unparalleled confidence in defending the motherland's sea defense. I want to work with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, to do my job well and be a defender of the motherland.
        Soldier of a certain unit of the People's Navy Luo Xuecan

　　站起来了的中国人民热爱共产党和毛主席
    在党的三十周年纪念日前后，人民日报连续发表了全国各地人民给党中央和毛主席的贺电和贺信。此外，人民日报并把没有全文发表的贺电及贺信的人名及单位名称发表出来；这个名单，直到今天还没有登完。
    这成千成万封贺电和贺信，使我深深感到：站起来了的中国人民是怎样热爱着我们伟大的党和英明的毛主席。我们的党代表着全国人民的利益。三十年来，党始终和人民在一起，向国内外敌人作坚决的斗争，领导人民建设我们伟大的祖国。在党的领导下，人民摆脱了枷锁，开始过着幸福的生活。这成千成万封的贺电和贺信，正是表明了全国人民的喜悦、愉快和对党、对毛主席的热爱；同时也表明了人民以自己的实际行动来保卫胜利果实和建设更幸福的将来的决心。
    这成千成万封贺电和贺信告诉我们：全中国的人民是紧紧地团结在党和毛主席的周围。这是一个巨大无比的力量。这保证我们一定能打败任何敌人的侵略，一定能够完成我们的建设事业。我是一个人民海军的战士。我有无比的信心来保卫祖国的海防。我要和全国人民一道，在党和毛主席的领导下，做好自己的工作，作一个祖国的捍卫者。
