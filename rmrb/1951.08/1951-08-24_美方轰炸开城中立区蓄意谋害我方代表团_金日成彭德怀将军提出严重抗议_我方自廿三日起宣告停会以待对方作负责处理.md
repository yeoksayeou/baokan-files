Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 23rd: General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, issued the following protest to General Ridgway:
　　General Ridgway: The bloodstains of Yao Qingxiang, our heroic platoon leader, who was illegally murdered by your armed personnel, are not yet dry, and your aircraft illegally intruded into the airspace above the Kaesong Neutral Zone meeting area at 10:20 pm on August 22nd, targeting the residence of our delegation for bombing and strafing. Although our delegation is filled with indignation, in order to clarify the truth of the incident to the world and to eliminate any excuses from your side attributing the cause of the incident to chance, we notified you to send personnel to investigate at 10:35 pm on August 22nd. Your liaison officer witnessed the crater of the bomb dropped by your aircraft, the bomb fragments, and various evidence that it was dropped hours earlier, and could only remain silent. In fact, even without the joint investigation of your liaison officer, the testimonies and material evidence we possess are sufficient to prove your undeniable provocative behavior. The reason you dare to continue to provoke so unscrupulously is because you mistakenly take our patience in striving for peace as a sign of weakness. You think that no matter what, we would not be willing to break off negotiations over such issues, so you do not hesitate to first shoot at Panmunjom, then murder our military police, and finally even try to murder our delegation. We want to tell you that this idea of yours is wrong. Indeed, our attitude has always been to exercise great patience in order to seek a peaceful armistice, but our patience is limited, and we also know deeply that peace can never be achieved by our unilateral demands for peace alone. Your side has been carrying out provocations so unscrupulously outside the conference, and has consistently insisted on your arrogant demand to push the military demarcation line into our positions inside the conference, in order to delay the progress of the negotiations. Therefore, your sincerity in the armistice negotiations is already clear. We hope that the armistice negotiations between us can proceed smoothly and obtain a fair and reasonable agreement acceptable to both sides, but how can this hope be realized when your side, after murdering our military police, then targets our delegation for purposeful murderous bombing? Therefore, our delegation has no choice but to announce the suspension of meetings from August 23rd, pending a responsible handling of this serious provocative incident by your side. Think about it, when the neutral zone is meaningless to your side, and you are ready to murder our unarmed representatives stationed in the neutral zone for the purpose of negotiating an armistice at any time, how can we continue the armistice negotiations? You should understand that all our interactions with you until now are based on equal treatment. If your side does not use actions to show that you respect this principle, but shamelessly regards yourselves as victors and arbitrarily destroys all agreements based on this, including the agreement on the neutralization of Kaesong, then all the responsibilities and consequences arising therefrom will fall entirely on your side. For the provocative incident of your armed forces bombing the Kaesong Neutral Zone at 10:20 pm on August 22nd with the deliberate intention of murdering our delegation, we lodge a serious protest to you in front of all fair-minded people in the world, and await your satisfactory reply.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Korean People's Army Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chinese People's Volunteer Army Commander Peng Dehuai
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　August 23, 1951

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 23rd: After the enemy aircraft raided the meeting area, our liaison officer immediately notified the US delegation's liaison officer in Munsan, urging them to come and investigate immediately. After the US liaison officer arrived, they expressed annoyance and perfunctoriness during the investigation process. For this reason, our liaison officer solemnly told the other liaison officer: I must point out the extreme seriousness of this incident. I have been ordered by our chief representative to lodge a serious protest with you verbally and inform you that all meetings on the 23rd will be suspended, and our side reserves the right to make all demands. Our side has verified that there are several bomb craters. The investigation is still ongoing.

　　美方轰炸开城中立区蓄意谋害我方代表团
    金日成彭德怀将军提出严重抗议
    我方自廿三日起宣告停会以待对方作负责处理
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军对李奇微的抗议，全文如下：
    李奇微将军：牺牲在你方武装人员的非法谋杀下的我方英勇战士姚庆祥排长的血迹未干，你方飞机竟又于八月二十二日夜十时二十分，非法侵入开城中立区会址区上空，以我代表团住所为目标，施行轰炸与扫射。我方代表团虽愤慨填膺，但为使事件之真相大白于天下，并解除你方将事件之起因归咎于偶然性之一切借口，仍于八月二十二日夜十时三十五分通知你方派员进行调查。你方派来的联络官目睹你方飞机所投炸弹的弹坑、炸弹碎片及其为数小时前投掷的各种证据，亦只能哑口无言。其实纵即无你方联络官的共同调查，我们所操有的人证、物证业已充分证明你方无可抵赖的挑衅行为。你们之所以敢于这样肆无忌惮地继续进行挑衅，就是因为你们错误地把我们争取和平的耐心当作一种示弱。你们以为无论如何我们是不会在这类问题上愿意使谈判破裂的，因此你们不惜初而射击板门店，再而谋杀我方军事警察，最后甚至想谋杀我方的代表团。我们要告诉你，你这种想法是错了。诚然，我们的态度从来就是为谋取和平停战而持以极大忍耐的，但我们的忍耐是有限度的，而且我们更深知单是我们片面要求和平，和平总是不可得到的。你方在会外既如此肆无忌惮地进行挑衅，在会内又一贯坚持你方把军事分界线推进到我方阵地之内的狂妄主张，以拖延谈判的进行，因而你方对于停战谈判的诚意如何，实已昭然若揭。我们是希望你我双方的停战谈判能够顺利进行并获得双方都能接受的公平合理的协议的，但你方于谋杀我方军事警察之后，竟又以我代表团为目标施行有目的的谋杀轰炸，这样的希望如何能够实现呢？因此我方代表团不能不从八月二十三日起宣告停会，以等待你对于你方这一严重的挑衅事件作负责的处理。你想一想，当中立区对你方毫无意义，你方随时准备谋杀为谈判停战而留驻在中立区的非武装的我方代表的时候，我们如何能继续停战谈判呢？你应该明白我们和你之间直至现在的一切来往是以平等对待为基础的，你方如不用行动来表示你们是尊重这一原则，而腼然以战胜者自居恣意破坏一切以此为基础的协议，包括开城中立化的协议在内，那么由此而产生的一切责任和后果，完全落在你方身上。为了二十二日夜十时二十分你方武装力量轰炸开城中立区蓄意谋害我方代表团的挑衅事件，我们在全世界一切公正的人民面前，向你提出严重抗议，并等待你的满意的答复。
              朝鲜人民军最高司令官  金日成
              中国人民志愿军司令员  彭德怀
              一九五一年八月二十三日
    【新华社开城二十三日电】敌机空袭会址区域后，我方联络官立即通知在汶山的美方代表团联络官，促其即来调查，美方联络官到此后，在调查过程中表示厌烦和敷衍。为此，我方联络官特郑重叮告对方联络官称：我必须指出这次事件的绝大严重性，我奉我方首席代表之命向你方先在口头上提出严重的抗议，并通知你：二十三日一切会议停开，我方保留提出一切要求的权利。我方已查明有弹坑数处。现正继续调查中。
