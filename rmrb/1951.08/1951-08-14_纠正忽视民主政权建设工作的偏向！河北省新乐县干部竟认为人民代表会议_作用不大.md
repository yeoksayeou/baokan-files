Correct the Deviation of Neglecting the Work of Democratic Regime Construction!
Cadres in Xinle County, Hebei Province, Actually Believe that the People's Representative Conference is "Not Very Effective"
    Xinle County, Hebei Province, has convened six sessions of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles, and the last one has already exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress; however, the leading cadres of the county have not clearly understood that the People's Representative Conference is the basic system of our national regime.
    First of all, the county once had a tendency towards bourgeois formal democracy in the election of representatives to the People's Representative Conference of All Circles. When the county convened its second session of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles last spring, according to the arrangements of the Provincial People's Government, it was considered that the election would only be valid if 50 percent of the voters participated in the vote. Therefore, the county mobilized all cadres, teachers and students, and carried out publicity for more than half a month, but the general public showed little interest in such election methods. As a result of the election, the number of people participating in the election in most villages did not exceed 30 percent of all voters. In order to strive to reach the "50 percent" figure, a few villages even mistakenly adopted compulsory participation methods such as militia sentries and blockading villages, which aroused resentment among the masses. In short, this election took a lot of effort from both cadres and the masses, and delayed production, but the result was still a failure. However, the county has learned from past lessons in the most recent representative election and changed to the method of raising hands for voting, which is easy for the masses, and has therefore achieved good results.
    Secondly, in the past, the county convened the People's Representative Conference of All Circles as a task assigned by the higher authorities. Until recently, the leading cadres of the county still believed that convening the People's Representative Conference of All Circles "takes a lot of effort and is not very effective," and that "without convening the People's Representative Conference of All Circles, all tasks can be completed by convening only cadre meetings; it is impossible to convene only representative meetings without convening cadre meetings anyway." Therefore, the county came up with a "simple and unified" method. When convening the third and fifth sessions of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles, it was decided that each village would send three people, one as a representative attending the meeting and two as cadres attending as observers, and the content of the meeting was mainly to arrange work. As a result of the county's adoption of this method, the nature of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles has actually become an ordinary cadre meeting. Only cadres spoke and offered ideas at the meeting, while the representatives only had the right to raise their hands to vote.
    In addition, when the county formulated the annual production plan this spring, it no longer convened the People's Representative Conference of All Circles because it had already convened the Party Representative Conference of the Chinese Communist Party and the expanded cadre meeting, and the tasks had already been arranged. This shows that due to the cadres' mistaken understanding, the county did not regard the People's Representative Conference as a fixed system, and all major tasks must be decided through the People's Representative Conference of All Circles and then implemented.

    纠正忽视民主政权建设工作的偏向！
　　河北省新乐县干部竟认为人民代表会议“作用不大”
    河北省新乐县已召开过六次各界人民代表会议，最后这一次已代行了人民代表大会的职权；但该县领导干部，还没有明确地了解人民代表会议是我们国家政权的基本制度。
    首先，该县在各界人民代表会议代表的选举问题上，曾经发生过资产阶级形式民主的偏向。该县去年春季召开第二次各界人民代表会议时，根据省人民政府的布置，认为须有百分之五十的选民参加投票选举，选举结果才算有效。因此该县动员了全体干部、教员和学生，进行了半个多月的宣传，但一般群众对于这样的选举办法却表示很冷淡。选举结果，大多数村庄参加选举的人数都不超过全部选民的百分之三十。少数村庄为了争取达到“百分之五十”的数目，甚至错误地采取了民兵放哨、封锁村庄的强制参加办法，引起了群众的反感。总之这次选举，干部和群众都费了很大力气，又耽误了生产，结果仍然是失败。不过该县在最近一次代表选举上已接受了过去的教训，改用便易于群众的举手表决的方法，因而收效良好。
    其次，该县过去召开各界人民代表会议，是把它当成上级交下来的任务去完成。直到最近该县领导干部仍认为，召开各界人民代表会议“费劲不小，作用不大”，“不开各界人民代表会议，只开干部会什么任务都能完成；只开代表会，不开干部会反正不行。”于是该县想出了一个“简便统一”的办法，在召开第三和第五次各界人民代表会议时，决定每个村来三个人，一个是出席会议的代表，两个是列席的干部，而会议的内容主要是布置工作。该县采取这种作法的结果，各界人民代表会议的性质实际上已经变成了普通的干部会。在会上只见干部发言，出主意，而代表则只有举手表决的权利。
    此外，该县在今年春季制订全年生产计划时，因为已经召开了中共的党代表会议和干部扩大会议，已经把任务布置下去了，于是就不再召开各界人民代表会议。这就说明由于干部的错误认识，该县没有把人民代表会议当成固定的制度，一切重大工作都要通过各界人民代表会议，作出决议，然后贯彻执行。
