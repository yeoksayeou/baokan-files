Long Live the Heroic Fighting Korean People!

	As a result of land reform, the farmers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were liberated from imperialist oppression and feudal exploitation. This is a scene of the Korean people celebrating the distribution of land certificates.

	Kim Il-sung University on Moranbong Hill in Korea is the highest institution of learning in Korea, built with rice donated by Korean farmers.

	The heroic Korean People's Army Navy.

	This is the Shuifeng Hydroelectric Power Plant, the industrial lifeline of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Now, although American imperialism is frantically destroying Korean industry, the strong Korean working class is fighting to restore it.

	On August 9, 1945, the Soviet Union, in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration, declared war on Japanese imperialism and completely defeated it on August 15, liberating the Korean people from their colonial slave life. This is the "Liberation Tower" built at the foot of Moranbong Hill in Pyongyang to commemorate the great achievements of the Soviet army in liberating the Korean people.

	On September 2, 1948, the historic first session of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea opened in Pyongyang. The constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was adopted, a Standing Committee was elected, a chairman was elected, and a cabinet was organized. This is General Kim Il-sung reporting on the cabinet's policy program at the meeting on September 12.

	During the period of Japanese fascist rule in Korea, General Kim Il-sung fought the Japanese invaders alongside the Chinese people in northeastern China for fifteen years of heroic armed struggle against Japanese imperialism. During the attack on the enemy at Pochonbo on the Korean side of the Yalu River's east bank, General Kim Il-sung's troops won a major victory, boosting the confidence and courage of the Korean people in their anti-Japanese struggle. This is part of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung.

	Our fraternal country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is a country with beautiful scenery, with countless magnificent peaks towering in the east and north. This is a famous scenic spot in Korea, Moranbong Hill in Pyongyang, at the foot of which is the famous Taedong River.

	The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has vast fertile fields and abundant resources. The hardworking, simple, brave, strong, and intelligent Korean people cultivate this land, and under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, they have improved their impoverished lives. This is a scene of busy farming, with farmers working in the fields and children being taken to the hillside to play by nurseries. Now, American imperialism is conducting frantic bombing and destruction, turning the peaceful villages of the Korean people into battlefields.

	At the end of 1948, the Soviet army accepted the proposal of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea for the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops and withdrew all Soviet troops. This is a scene of the citizens of Pyongyang warmly welcoming the Soviet army, which brought them a happy and free life, with infinite gratitude.

英勇战斗的朝鲜人民万岁！
    英勇的朝鲜人民军空军。
    土地改革的结果，使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的农民从帝国主义压迫和封建的残酷剥削中解放出来。这是朝鲜人民庆祝颁发土地证券的情形。
    朝鲜牡丹峰金日成大学是朝鲜的最高学府，它是由朝鲜农民献米建造的。
     获得朝鲜人民会议奖的阿吾地人造油厂的工人和工厂全景。
     英勇的朝鲜人民军海军。
     这是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的工业大动脉——水丰发电厂。现在，虽然美帝国主义对朝鲜的工业进行了疯狂的破坏，但是，坚强的朝鲜工人阶级正在为恢复朝鲜的工业而奋斗。
     一九四五年八月九日苏联根据波茨坦宣言向日本帝国主义宣战，于八月十五日彻底打垮了日本帝国主义，把朝鲜人民从殖民地的奴隶生活中解放出来。这是建立在平壤牡丹峰中麓，为了纪念苏军解放朝鲜人民的伟大功勋的“解放塔”。
     一九四八年九月二日，有历史意义的朝鲜最高人民会议第一次会议在平壤开幕。通过了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法，选出常任委员会，选举主席，组织内阁。这是九月十二日金日成将军在会议上报告内阁施政纲领的情形。
     英勇的朝鲜人民军陆军。
     在日本法西斯统治朝鲜时期，金日成将军在中国东北境内与中国人民共同抗击日寇，和日本帝国主义进行了十五年之久的英勇武装斗争。在袭击鸭绿江东岸朝鲜境内普天堡的敌人时，金日成将军所部获得了重大胜利，鼓舞了朝鲜人民抗日斗争的信心和勇气。这是金日成将军领导下的抗日联军之一部。
     朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首相金日成将军。
     我们的兄弟之邦——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，是一个风景秀丽的国家，在东部和北部高耸着无数奇丽的山峰。这是朝鲜的名胜——平壤牡丹峰，山下就是有名的大同江。
     朝鲜民主主义人民共和国有着广大肥沃的田野和富饶的资源，勤劳朴素、英勇坚强而富有智慧的朝鲜人民，就在这块土地上耕作，在金日成将军的领导下，他们改善了贫困的生活。这是农忙的时候，农民们正在田里耕作，孩子们由托儿所带到山坡上游玩。现在，美帝国主义正在进行疯狂的轰炸和破坏，他们把朝鲜人民的和平村庄变成战场。
     一九四八年年底，苏联军队接受朝鲜最高人民会议关于苏美军队同时撤退的提议，将全部苏联军队撤退。这是平壤市民怀着无限感激的心情，热烈欢送给他们带来幸福自由生活的苏联军队。
