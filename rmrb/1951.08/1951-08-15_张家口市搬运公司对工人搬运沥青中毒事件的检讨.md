Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

We are responsible for the incident reported in the People's Daily on July 12th, in which several workers from the Zhangjiakou Transport Company were poisoned while handling asphalt blocks. We indeed did not pay enough attention to the safety of our workers. After the poisoning incident in Qingdao involving workers handling fertilizer, the National Transport Workers' Union issued a circular urging us to be vigilant about such incidents. However, we only talked to the workers about it and took no further measures. Since then, there have been several incidents of workers being poisoned while handling asphalt and other materials in various places, and some have even died from poisoning. However, we still did not pay enough attention to it, and we did not prepare the necessary protective equipment. On June 7th, workers from our company transported asphalt for the Hebei Provincial Trust Company. Knowing that asphalt was poisonous, we lightly believed the cargo owner's words that "this is native asphalt and not poisonous." As a result, another thirty-nine workers were poisoned. On July 14th, Li Zhenda, a material handler from the Railway Material Factory, deceived the workers by hiding ninety-six packages of asphalt in miscellaneous goods, resulting in another nine workers being poisoned.

Only now do we realize that our thinking was too lax, and our lack of concern for workers' lives was too serious! Now, we must strengthen the technical education of our workers on the one hand, and prepare the necessary protective equipment on the other. The above two asphalt poisoning incidents were mainly due to our own lack of attention to the safety of workers' lives and insufficient vigilance, which led us to lightly believe the cargo owner's lies and deceptions. We must be particularly vigilant about this in the future.

### 张家口市搬运公司对工人搬运沥青中毒事件的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    张家口市搬运公司对工人搬运沥青中毒事件的检讨编辑同志：
    七月十二日人民日报批评张家口搬运公司工人搬运沥青块多人中毒的事情，我们是有责任的。我们对于工人的安全问题确是不够重视。青岛发生搬运肥田粉中毒事件后，全国搬运工会曾有通报要我们警惕这样的事情。但是，我们只是给工人谈了一下，就再没有其他的措施。此后，各地工人因搬运沥青等物而中毒的事件又发生几次，甚至有中毒死亡的。但是，我们仍然没有给予足够的注意，更没准备必要的防护用具。六月七日我公司搬运工人给河北省信托公司搬运沥青，明知沥青有毒，但轻信货主的话，说“这是土皮青，没有毒”。结果，又有三十九名工人中毒。七月十四日铁路材料厂材料员李振达欺骗工人，在杂货包内藏置沥青九十六包，结果又有九名工人中毒。
    至此，我们才认识到，我们思想太麻痹了，不关心工人生命的现象太严重了！现在，我们一方面要加强工人的技术教育，一方面也要准备必要的防护用具。以上两次搬沥青中毒事件，主要是由于我们自己不重视工人生命安全，警惕性不够，所以才轻信货主的谎言欺骗，今后我们对此要特别提高警惕。
