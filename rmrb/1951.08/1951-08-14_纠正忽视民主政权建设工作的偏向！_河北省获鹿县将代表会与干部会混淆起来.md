Correct the Deviation of Neglecting the Construction of Democratic Political Power!
　　Huolu County, Hebei Province, Confuses Representative Conferences with Cadre Meetings

At the end of June, the People's Government of Huolu County, Hebei Province, conducted an inspection of the county and district people's representative conferences held in the past year and found that the county's people's representative conferences had a tendency of "becoming less and less effective" and steadily declining.

Since the second county-level people's representatives conference was held in 1949, the county held a county-level people's congress in the spring of 1950, and elected the county head and the government committee. By June of this year, five representative conferences and seven government committee meetings had been held. Through the representative conferences, democracy was further promoted, and the connection between the government and the people was strengthened. Certain achievements were made in implementing policies, promoting work, and improving the work style of cadres.

However, due to the county leadership's insufficient understanding of the people's congress as "the basic system of our country," and the confusion of representative conferences with cadre meetings, they did not understand that the county people's congress is the highest organ of power for the people of the county to exercise political power. Therefore, a deviation of "simply using representatives" was formed, and the people's representatives became the cadres' "errand runners." When the county first convened the people's representative conference, the leadership carefully and cautiously paid attention to the preparations for the conference and the promotion of democracy, so the representatives were quite satisfied, and their morale was high. After returning, they also conveyed the resolutions more thoroughly. However, the leadership did not have a real understanding of this system, and treated it as a task. After achieving some results and receiving praise, they became complacent. Not only did they fail to prepare well before the meeting, but they did not even elect a presidium during the meeting, mistakenly treating the county government committee as the natural presidium. At the meetings, party members spoke more, and non-party representatives had fewer opportunities to speak, narrowing the scope of democracy. At the same time, out of the five representative conferences, only two focused on discussing production and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, while the remaining three discussed collection. In addition, the leadership did not pay enough attention to the proposals of the masses and did not seriously handle them, causing the majority of representatives to believe that "holding representative conferences is simply to ask the masses for things," thereby reducing the enthusiasm of the representatives. District and village cadres believed that "the representative conference is no different from an expanded cadre meeting," both were for arranging work to complete tasks; the representatives themselves also mostly attended the meetings with an attitude of "accepting tasks"; especially the village cadres who also served as representatives, forgetting that they were people's representatives, and convened a package of meetings to explain the tasks after returning, forming a blurred line between the representative conference and the cadre meeting, reducing the significance of the people's representative conference. In addition, the county did not have a standing committee or resident staff, and there was a lack of regular contact between the government and the representatives; there was no one specifically responsible for the preparations for the conference. When convening the conference, the notices were not only sent out in a timely manner, but even sent out randomly. Some representatives were not given notices, while those who were not representatives were given representative certificates.

Due to the above reasons, the people's representatives lost interest in attending the people's representative conferences. The number of representatives attending decreased with each conference. Out of the two hundred and thirty-five county people's representatives, nearly fifty were absent from the third conference, and nearly one-third were absent from the fourth conference. For the fifth conference, notices were issued twice, and district cadres personally went to the villages to mobilize attendance, but still fifty-two were absent. The number of proposals also decreased significantly, from more than three hundred in the first conference to only twenty-six later. This deteriorating situation finally attracted the attention and review of the county leadership.

### 纠正忽视民主政权建设工作的偏向！  河北省获鹿县将代表会与干部会混淆起来

　　纠正忽视民主政权建设工作的偏向！
    河北省获鹿县将代表会与干部会混淆起来
    河北省获鹿县人民政府于六月底对该县一年来县、区人民代表大会召开情况，进行了一次检查，发现该县人民代表大会有“越开越没劲”、每况愈下的趋势。
    该县自一九四九年召开第二次县各界代表会议后，于一九五○年春召开了县人民代表大会，选举了县长和政府委员会，到今年六月已开过五次代表大会、七次政府委员会。经过代表会议进一步发扬了民主，密切了政府和人民群众的联系，在贯彻政策、推动工作、改进干部作风方面，均获得了一定的成绩。
    但是由于该县领导思想上对人民代表大会是“我们国家的基本制度”认识不足，将代表会与干部会混淆，不了解县人民代表大会是全县人民行使政权的最高权力机关，所以形成了“单纯使用代表”的偏向，人民代表成了干部的“跑腿”。该县最初召开人民代表会议时，领导上曾经小心谨慎地注意会议的各项准备工作和发扬民主，因而颇获代表满意，代表情绪亦较高涨，回去后传达决议也较为深入。但领导上对这一制度并未有真正的认识，当作任务搞了一下，有些成绩，受到表扬，后来就产生了自满情绪，不但开会前不很好地进行准备，甚至开会时也不选主席团，错误地把县政府委员会作为当然的主席团。会议上党员发言多，非党代表发言机会少，缩小了民主范围。同时，五次代表会议的中心议题，只有两次是讨论生产和镇压反革命、抗美援朝，其余三次都是讨论征收，加上领导上对群众的提案重视不足，不认真处理，致使多数代表认为“开代表大会就单纯是向群众要东西”，因而降低了代表的积极性。区、村干部认为“代表会与扩干会没啥分别”，都是为了布置工作完成任务；代表本身也多是抱着“接受任务”的态度而来出席会议；特别是兼任代表的村干部，更忘记了自己是人民代表，回去后就召开一揽子会交代任务，形成代表会与干部会混淆不清，降低了人民代表会的意义。此外，该县没有常委会和驻会人员，政府和代表间缺乏经常的联系；会议准备没有专人负责，召开会议时，通知发的既不及时，甚至乱发通知，有的代表不发给通知，不是代表的倒给了代表证。
    由于以上原因，人民代表们对人民代表大会的召开就不感兴趣，代表出席人数就一次比一次减少，县人民代表共二三五名，第三次大会缺席近五○名，第四次缺席近三分之一，第五次下了两次通知，区干部亲自下乡动员，尚缺席五十二名。提案数量亦大为减少，由第一次三百余件减至后来仅有二十六件。这种每况愈下的情况，至此才引起该县领导上的注意和检讨。
