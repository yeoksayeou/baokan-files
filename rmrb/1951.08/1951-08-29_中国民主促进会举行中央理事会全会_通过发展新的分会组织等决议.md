    Passes Resolutions on Developing New Branch Organizations, etc.
    [By Our Newspaper] The Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Council of the China Association for Promoting Democracy was held in Beijing from the 11th to the 19th of this month. At the opening, Chairman Ma Xulun of the association delivered the opening speech. Vice Minister Xing Xiping of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference spoke at the meeting. This meeting carefully reviewed the work of the association in the eight months since the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Council, summarized the work experience, solved some specific problems in terms of policy and ideology, and determined the future direction of the work. Finally, it unanimously adopted the "Work Summary Report," the "Resolution on Developing New Branch Organizations," the "Resolution on Establishing Grassroots Organizations, Strengthening Organizational Education, and Further Developing Organizations," and the "Provisional Measures for Establishing Grassroots Organizations," etc.
    This meeting made specific discussions on many important issues in the current work of the association, and determined that the development of organizations must face the middle and lower levels, with primary and secondary school teachers as the main target of development. In order to give full play to the strength of the organization and enrich the organizational life, grassroots organizations must be established universally based on work units. The development of members must be done through grassroots organizations, and it was decided to establish new branches in appropriate and necessary areas in a planned, focused, and step-by-step manner. In addition, the meeting had a clearer and more unified understanding of specific issues such as strengthening cadre education, absorbing some activists to participate in leadership institutions, and obtaining the assistance of the Communist Party of China through repeated discussions. At the closing of the meeting, all the representatives unanimously adopted a declaration supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement of August 15.
