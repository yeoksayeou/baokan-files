Xinhua News Agency, August 19th - The U.S. government, in order to intensify its war preparations in Europe, has decided to hold the U.S., British, and French foreign ministers' meeting and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, and has recently hurriedly announced the meeting dates. The Three Foreign Ministers Conference is scheduled to be held in Washington on September 11. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council will hold two consecutive meetings, the first of which is scheduled to be held in Ottawa, Canada, on September 15, and the second in Rome at the end of October.

U.S. imperialism is very afraid that the realization of a Korean armistice will relax its arms expansion and war preparation deployment, so it attempts to force Britain, France, and other Western European vassal states to fully accept the U.S. war preparation plan in Europe through this series of meetings. A Reuter dispatch from London on August 3, quoting so-called "well-informed sources," revealed that Truman is preparing for a "diplomatic showdown, especially with Britain and France," in order to "politically and militarily plug the 'loopholes'" in the U.S. aggression system "in a timely manner." The well-informed sources said that Truman will, in the above-mentioned series of meetings, "try to complete various aspects of anti-Soviet policies within a time limit, and eliminate any disputes in the allocation of command positions in important defense areas and political obstacles to military plans." Truman will take the following actions on European war preparations: "Terminate the state of war with Germany to accelerate the process of re-militarization"; "Let Turkey join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization"; "Hold open negotiations to obtain the right to use Spanish bases." These people also said, "Diplomatic exchanges of views have already been conducted for the purpose of clearing the way for a final showdown."

One of the results of these "exchanges of views" is that representatives of the U.S., British, and French governments and the West German puppet government concluded the first stage of negotiations on drafting a treaty between the three countries and West Germany to replace the occupation regulations on August 3. This negotiation has been held in Bonn since May of this year. The U.S. plan to conclude a new treaty is a further illegal conspiracy following the Western countries' unilateral announcement in July of the "end of the state of war with Germany." Its purpose is to create "legal" conditions for freely arming West Germany under the premise of actually maintaining the occupation rule over West Germany by concluding a treaty that gives West Germany the status of an "equal ally." The Associated Press, in reporting on the inside story of the Bonn negotiations, said that the "fundamental issue considered" by the U.S., Britain, and France in drafting the treaty "is to maintain the right to station 300,000 U.S., British, and French troops in Germany. Moreover, these troops will not be bound by German law." Reuters even undisguisedly stated that the proposed new occupation regulation with a changed appearance is "closely linked to German rearmament." Furthermore, according to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on August 11, such a deceptive "measure to end the six-year occupation control of West Germany" will be the theme of the U.S., British, and French foreign ministers' meeting in Washington.

However, in the process of "exchanging views" with its vassal states and "clearing the way for a final showdown," the U.S. still encounters numerous difficulties and obstacles. It is remembered that when the U.S. initially suggested holding a meeting of the three foreign ministers in mid-July, its main intention was to force France and Britain to accept the most important part of the U.S. war preparation plan in Europe—the plan to incorporate West German troops into the North Atlantic aggressive forces—at this meeting. An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on July 28 said that at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Ottawa, held after the Three Foreign Ministers Conference, "the issue of Germany's participation in European defense will be definitively resolved." However, a few days later, a spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council said on August 3: "The issue of Germany's participation in Western defense may not be discussed in time at the Ottawa meeting." A Reuters dispatch from London on August 2 quoted British officials as saying: "The preparatory work for Germany's participation in Western defense has not progressed sufficiently to allow the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council (i.e., the Ottawa meeting) in September to reach a final resolution."

### 惧怕朝鲜停战会松弛扩军活动  美国加紧在西欧备战  正布置侵略会议放手武装西德

　　惧怕朝鲜停战会松弛扩军活动
    美国加紧在西欧备战
    正布置侵略会议放手武装西德
    【新华社十九日讯】美国政府为了加紧在欧洲的备战措施而决定召开的美、英、法三国外长会议和北大西洋公约理事会会议，已在最近匆匆宣布开会日期。三国外长会议定于九月十一日在华盛顿举行。北大西洋公约理事会则将连续举行二个会议，第一个会议定于九月十五日在加拿大的渥太华举行，第二个会议定于十月底在罗马举行。
    美帝国主义十分害怕朝鲜停战的实现会使它的扩军备战部署松弛下来，因而它企图通过这一连串会议来逼迫英、法及其他西欧附庸国家完全接受美国在欧洲的备战计划。合众社伦敦八月三日电引所谓“消息灵通人士”的话透露：杜鲁门正准备在“外交上摊牌，特别是与英国和法国”，以“及时从政治上和军事上堵塞”美国侵略体系中的“漏洞”。消息灵通人士说：杜鲁门将在上述一连串会议中，“设法限期完成各方面的反苏政策，并使重要防区的指挥职务的分配方面和军事计划的政治障碍方面，没有争论的余地”。杜鲁门将在欧洲备战措施上采取如下几个行动：“终止对德战争状态，以加速重新军国主义化的进行”；“让土耳其参加北大西洋公约机构”；“举行公开谈判，以取得使用西班牙基地的权利”。这些人士又说，“目前已经进行了外交上的交换意见，目的是要为最后摊牌扫清道路。”
    这些“交换意见”的结果之一，是美、英、法三国政府与西德傀儡政府的代表在八月三日结束了草拟三国与西德缔结协定以代替占领法规的第一阶段谈判工作，这一谈判自今年五月起即在波恩举行。美国这项缔结新协定的计划，是继七月间指使西方国家片面宣布“结束对德战争状态”后进一步的非法阴谋，其目的，是准备在实际上维持对西德的占领统治的前提下，用缔结给予西德以“平等的盟国”地位的协定，来为放手武装西德造成“合法”条件。美联社在报道波恩谈判的内幕时曾说：美、英、法三国在草拟协定时“所考虑到的根本问题，是想保持在德国驻扎三十万美、英、法军队的权利。并且，这些军队将不受德国法律的约束。”合众社更毫不掩饰地说：拟议中的这个改头换面的新占领法规，是与“德国重新武装密切地联系在一起”的。又据合众社华盛顿八月十一日电透露：这样的一个骗人的“结束对西德六年占领管制的措施”，将是美、英、法三国外长华盛顿会议讨论的主题。
    但是，美国在与其附庸国家“交换意见”“为最后摊牌扫清道路”的过程中，依然碰到重重困难与障碍。人们记得，美国最初在七月中旬建议召开三国外长会议时，主要是打算在这个会议上逼迫法、英两国接受美国在欧洲备战计划中最主要的一环——把西德军队编入北大西洋侵略军的计划。法新社华盛顿七月二十八日电曾说：在三国外长会议以后举行的北大西洋公约理事会渥太华会议上，“将确定地解决德国参加欧洲防务问题”。然而，过了几天，北大西洋公约理事会发言人在八月三日却说：“德国参加西方防务问题，可能来不及在渥太华会议上讨论。”合众社伦敦八月二日电，英国官员也表示：“关于德国参加西方防务的准备工作，进行得还不足以使九月间的北大西洋公约理事会（即渥太华会议）获致最后决议。”
