Short Commentary:

　　A Model for Engineering and Technical Personnel
    Zhang Lianbu, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Northwest Construction Company, in the construction of the warehouse project of the state-owned Xianyang Cotton Textile Factory, went deep into the site, discovered problems in the project, and conscientiously organized employees to conduct drilling, thus avoiding potential dangers in the project. This is the attitude of ownership that technical workers in New China should have.
    Some engineering and technical personnel have not adopted the working attitude of Deputy Chief Engineer Zhang Lianbu. They mistakenly regard a high degree of responsibility for the people's cause as "unbounded responsibility." They like to define their responsibilities within a very small scope. For matters outside this small scope, even if they know something is wrong, they don't interfere. Because they think: "As long as my responsibility is fulfilled, if something happens to others, it has nothing to do with me." "The superiors tell me what to do, I will do it. I cannot be responsible for whether it is done well or poorly." This kind of thinking is a hired-hand mentality.
    The hired-hand mentality is extremely harmful to the people's cause, and we must oppose it. Technical personnel in New China are all masters of the enterprise and should work with the attitude of masters, like Deputy Chief Engineer Zhang Lianbu, and consciously promote a high degree of responsibility to the people. Technical personnel of New China, go deep into the site, dedicate your technology wholeheartedly to the people, and let your technology play its full role!

### 工程技术人员的榜样

　　工程技术人员的榜样
    西北建筑公司张连步副总工程师在修建国营咸阳棉纺织厂仓库工程中，深入现场，发现工程中的问题，并认真地组织职工进行钻探，因而避免了工程中可能发生的危险。这是新中国的技术工作者应有的主人翁的态度。
    有些工程技术人员还没有采取张连步副总工程师这样的工作态度，他们错把对于人民事业的高度负责认为是“责任无边”。他们喜欢把自己的职责，划在很小的范围内。对于这小范围以外的事情，明知道不对，也不过问。因为他们觉得：“只要我的责任完成了，别人出了事，与我无关。”“上级让我做什么，我就做什么。作好作坏，我可不能负责。”这样的想法，就是雇佣观点。
    雇佣观点是对人民事业极为有害的，我们必须反对。新中国的技术人员都是企业的主人，都应该像张连步副总工程师那样，用主人翁的态度工作，自觉地发扬高度的为人民负责的精神。新中国的技术人员们，深入现场，全心全意把自己的技术献给人民，让自己的技术充分发挥作用吧！
