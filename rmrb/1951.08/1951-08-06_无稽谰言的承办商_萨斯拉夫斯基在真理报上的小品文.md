Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 31st: "A Purveyor of Nonsense" is the title of a short essay published by Zaslavsky in today's "Pravda." Zaslavsky satirizes the slanderous nonsense fabricated by U.S. Army Major General O'Daniel about Moscow and the Soviet people.

Zaslavsky said: There is probably no one on earth who can deny that there is no phenomenon more solemn, great, and inspiring than the peaceful construction of the Soviet Union. This peaceful construction is carried out everywhere in the Soviet Union. Millions of people, tens of thousands of factories, institutions, and universities, cities and collective farms are engaged in this peaceful construction. Prairies and deserts are being transformed. Urban development is being carried out on a large scale. This has already been reflected in literature and newspapers. Reflected in poetry, painting, architecture and science. This is obvious to all, and people in all countries far beyond the borders of the Soviet Union know about it. Even those who have never been to the Soviet Union know about it.

However, before us is an American who lived in the Soviet Union for two years, and who recently returned to the United States, and who arbitrarily said that he had not seen any of this at all, that he had not heard anything about any great construction projects, and therefore he arbitrarily said that there was no such thing at all. So, is he blind or deaf? No, he is a U.S. Army Major General; his name is John O'Daniel, and his wife's name is Ruth. He lived in Moscow for two years, officially as a military attache, and unofficially as a spy. He has narrated the results of his two years of observation in "Collier's Magazine." After reading it, you will be amazed at how deeply humanity is still hiding in the primeval jungle.

Zaslavsky continued: Reading General O'Daniel's article is like seeing through to the soul of today's American warlords: it is bizarre and terrifying. General O'Daniel is not without cunning. He has been staring at the Soviet land as a spy for two years - and has seen nothing and understood nothing. This is due to his primitive state of mind. But he also distorts the facts and maliciously distorts the facts in his article - and that is because he is already cunning.

A person from the United States takes the train in the Moscow subway. His eyes reflect nothing - no surprise, no admiration, no curiosity. But this same American spy writes in his article that the Moscow subway was built by foreign engineers. Now, this is not ignorance. This is a lie. An American couple goes to a sports competition. Of course, they don't understand anything. But the general says in his article that in the boxing ring, many people sat there, surprisingly quietly, not cheering for anyone. Zaslavsky said: This American general, accustomed to seeing the crude scenes in American racetracks, cannot understand the cultural level of Soviet audiences, and this cannot be blamed on him. But, be careful, he is also desperately trying to force others to accept his standards of right and wrong, desperately slandering the Soviet people, and describing the Soviet people as passive, cold-hearted, and indifferent to everything. And this is no longer naive ignorance. This is a sin, and it is for this sin that the general's parents had whipped the general in his childhood saying: "Don't lie, little John, don't lie."

Zaslavsky mentioned the nonsense that the general's wife said about the clothing of the Soviet people, and the general used that nonsense to "enrich" his article, but he deliberately did not mention the Soviet Union's price reductions.

The essay also talked about the general using worthless tricks to deny the peaceful construction of the Soviet capital. He published a photo of the Soviet Palace, which was temporarily suspended in the magazine. The construction project was interrupted by the war, and then temporarily suspended, but the general deliberately did not mention this fact. Zaslavsky said: The general deliberately did not mention the large-scale construction projects that are being carried out in Moscow and throughout the Soviet Union. It is hard to believe that this spy has not seen the skyscrapers in Moscow, which are impossible not to see.

Zaslavsky concluded: American magazines are trying to deceive their readers. The general's article will give readers a completely distorted impression of Moscow today. On the other hand, we have gained an absolutely correct impression of a typical American slander expert, and of American magazines that publish all kinds of nonsense.

### “无稽谰言的承办商”——萨斯拉夫斯基在真理报上的小品文

　　“无稽谰言的承办商”
    ——萨斯拉夫斯基在真理报上的小品文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科七月三十一日电：“无稽谰言的承办商”这是萨斯拉夫斯基在今天的“真理报”上发表的一篇小品文的标题。萨斯拉夫斯基讥嘲美国陆军少将奥丹尼尔所杜撰的关于莫斯科和苏联人民的诽谤谰言。
    萨斯拉夫斯基说：地球上大概没有一个人能够否认，天下没有一种现象比苏联的和平建设更庄严伟大、而令人鼓舞的了。这种和平建设在苏联处处地方进行着，千百万人民、千千万万的工厂、机关和大学、城市和集体农场，在从事这种和平建设。草原和沙漠在变形。城市的发展在大规模进行中。这是已经反映在文学和报纸上的事情。反映在诗歌、绘画、建筑术和科学中的事情。这是有目共睹的事情，远在苏联边疆外的各国人民都知道这种事情。从来不曾到过苏联的人也知道这种事情。
    但是，在我们面前却有一个美国人，曾在苏联住过两年之久，最近回到美国去，竟然武断说他完全不曾看到这种事情，他完全不曾听到关于什么伟大建设工程的事情，因此他武断说根本没有这一回事。那么，他难道是瞎子、是聋子吗？不，他是一个美国陆军少将；他的名字是约翰·奥丹尼尔，他的妻子的名字是卢斯。他在莫斯科住了两年之久，正式名义是当一个陆军武官，而非正式的是当一个奸细。他已把他两年来观察的结果在“柯里尔杂志”中叙述出来。你们读了以后会大吃一惊：人类依然藏匿在多么草昧的莽丛中呀。
    萨斯拉夫斯基继续说：读奥丹尼尔将军的文章，就仿佛透视到今天美国军阀的灵魂一样：那是稀奇古怪而令人毛骨悚然的。奥丹尼尔将军并不是不狡猾的。他两年来以奸细的身分瞪目凝视着苏维埃国土——而竟然什么都没有看见，什么都没有了解。这是由于他那原始时代的精神状态。但是他在他的文章中也曲解事实，恶意地曲解事实——而这就是由于他已经狡猾了。
    来自美国的一个人，在莫斯科地下铁道坐火车。他的眼睛里没有反映出什么来——没有惊异、没有赞美、没有好奇。但是，这同一个美国奸细，在他的文章中却写到：莫斯科地下铁道是外国工程师建筑的。现在，这并不是无知哪。这是一种谎话。一对美国夫妇去看体育比赛。他们当然一点都不了解。但是那个将军在他的文章中说、在斗拳场上，许多人坐在那里，安静得令人惊奇，并不为任何一个人而欢呼。萨斯拉夫斯基说：这位美国将军，看美国跑马厅中那种粗野的场面看惯了，不能够理解苏联观众的文化水平，这是不能够责备他的。但是，你们当心，他还拚命迫使别人接受他的是非善恶的标准，拚命诽谤苏联人，把苏联人说成是被动的、冷淡无情的、对一切事情漠不关心的人。而这不复是天真的无知了。这是一种罪过，就是为了这种罪过，这个将军的父母曾鞭挞过儿童时期的将军说：“不要说谎，小约翰，不要说谎。”
    萨斯拉夫斯基提到将军夫人所说的关于苏联人民服装的谰言，将军就用那种谰言来“丰富”他的文章，而他却故意只字不提苏联削减物价的事情。
    小品文中也谈到那将军使用一文不值的伎俩，竟否认苏联首都的和平建设。他在那杂志上发表了暂时停工的苏维埃宫的照片。那建设工程为战争所中断，后来才暂时停顿的，而关于这种事实，那将军却只字不提。萨斯拉夫斯基说：关于在莫斯科和在苏联全国同样正在进行的规模宏大的建设工程，那将军故意只字不提。很难相信这个奸细根本不曾看到决不可能看不到的如莫斯科的那些高楼大厦之类。
    萨斯拉夫斯基在结语中说：美国杂志企图欺骗它的读者们。那将军的文章会使读者获得完全歪曲了的关于今日莫斯科的印象。另一方面，我们却已获得了绝对正确的关于一个典型美国诽谤专家的印象、关于登载所有各种胡言乱语的文字的美国杂志的印象。
