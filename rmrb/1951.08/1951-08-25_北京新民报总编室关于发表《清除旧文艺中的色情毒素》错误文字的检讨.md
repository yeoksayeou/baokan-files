Reaction to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to the People's Daily

　　Beijing Xinmin Daily Editorial Office's Self-Criticism Regarding the Publication of Erroneous Text in "Eliminating Pornographic Toxins in Old Literature and Art"
　　On August 18th, this newspaper (Beijing "Xinmin Daily") published erroneous text in Liu Yong's "Eliminating Pornographic Toxins in Old Literature and Art" on the eighth page's "Literary Criticism" section, which aroused widespread dissatisfaction among readers, who made severe criticisms through phone calls and letters. These opinions are correct and valuable, and helped us to discover the error in a timely manner.
　　As the readers' letters stated, Liu Yong's erroneous text only quoted a large number of obscene and vulgar examples from lewd ditties, without analysis or criticism, and without pointing out how to eliminate them. This not only completely nullified the author's "intention" to "eliminate" but also promoted pornography in an egregious way.
　　We believe that the pornographic toxins in old literature and art should be strictly criticized, and a serious struggle should continue to be waged, because old literature and art still has a considerable number of readers today. We should make it clear to these readers so that they understand that the pornographic toxins in old literature and art are extremely harmful. Our "Literary Criticism" weekly should also do a good job in this regard. However, we mistakenly published Liu Yong's vulgar text, trivializing and degrading the serious struggle to eliminate pornographic toxins in old literature and art. We believe this error is serious.
　　The basic reasons for this error are as follows:
　　1. We have not yet raised the issue of being seriously and earnestly responsible to the readers to the level of principle. In the past six months, more serious errors have appeared three times in the supplement: one was the issue of the film *The Life of Wu Xun* (we blindly promoted it without even seeing the film), another was the report on Xin Fengxia's divorce (which was inappropriately sensationalized). Therefore, the publication of Liu Yong's erroneous text in "Literary Criticism" this time is by no means accidental. We have not paid enough attention to our work ideologically, and we have not paid enough attention to what impact the publication of an article will have on readers. This means that our liberalism is serious, causing undue errors to occur continuously.
　　2. Under the domination of such thoughts, the chaos in our work is also serious. For example, when editors send manuscripts to the editorial office, there are often cases of missing manuscripts, and when editors make up for the manuscripts, they often send them directly for typesetting without going through the editorial office. This state of anarchy and style of work has never attracted our attention and vigilance. And this serious error in "Literary Criticism" was produced under similar circumstances.
　　We are busy all day long, but we are also careless, which puts us in danger of becoming politically blind. Obviously, errors like publishing Liu Yong's vulgar text were not impossible to avoid!
　　In order to remedy this loss, we have made the following decisions:
　　(1) Publicly review and acknowledge the error;
　　(2) Improve the editing situation of "Literary Criticism" and decide to establish a three-person team to edit it;
　　(3) Strengthen the ideological leadership of supplement work and improve the ideological level of editors;
　　(4) Resolutely oppose the anarchic state of manuscript publication and improve the manuscript review system.
　　This error is a very important education for us. We are determined to correct our mistakes and improve our work.

### 北京新民报总编室关于发表《清除旧文艺中的色情毒素》错误文字的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　北京新民报总编室关于发表《清除旧文艺中的色情毒素》错误文字的检讨
    八月十八日本报（北京《新民报》）第八版《文艺批评》上曾发表了流涌的《清除旧文艺中的色情毒素》的错误文字，引起了读者们的普遍不满，纷纷来电话或来信提出了严厉的批评，这些意见都是正确的、宝贵的，帮助了我们及时地发现了错误。
    正如读者的来信所说，流涌的错误文字只引用了臭小调的一大堆猥亵的下流不堪的例句，而没有分析与批判，更没有指出如何清除的办法，这不但使作者的“清除”的“意图”完全落了空，反而恶劣地宣传了色情。
    我们认为在旧文艺中的色情毒素，是应该予以严格批判，应该继续展开严肃的斗争，因为旧文艺在今天还拥有相当数量的读者，我们应该向这部分读者说清楚，使其了解旧文艺中的色情毒素是极端有害的。我报的《文艺批评》周刊，也应该作好这一件工作。但是，我们竟错误地发表了流涌的下流文字，把清除旧文艺中的色情毒素的严肃的斗争，庸俗化了，低级化了，我们认为这个错误是严重的。
    造成这次错误的基本原因有下列两点：
    一、严肃的认真的对读者负责任，我们还没有提到原则上来认识。半年来，较严重的错误在副刊上已出现了三次：一次是电影《武训传》的问题（我们连电影都还没有看，就盲目地作了宣传），另一次是报导新凤霞离婚的问题（很不恰当地作了渲染），因此，这一次在《文艺批评》上发表流涌的错误文字就决非偶然。我们还没有在思想上足够地重视我们的工作，没有足够地重视我们发表一篇文章将给读者带来什么影响。这是说：我们的自由主义思想是严重的，使得不应有的错误连续发生。
    二、在这样的思想支配下，工作中的混乱情况也是严重的，如像编辑送稿到总编室来，时有缺稿的情形，而编辑同志在补稿时，往往不经过总编室，就直接发排了。这种无政府状态和作风，就一直没有引起我们的重视与警惕。而这次《文艺批评》上的严重错误，就是在类似的情形下产生的。
    我们成天忙忙碌碌，而又马马虎虎，这就有变为政治上的瞎子的危险。很明显，像发表流涌的下流文字，这样的错误，本来不是不能避免的！
    我们为了挽救这一个损失，作了如下的决定：
    （１）公开检讨，承认错误；
    （２）改进《文艺批评》的编辑状况，决定成立一个三人小组来编；
    （３）加强对副刊工作的思想领导，提高编辑同志的思想水平；
    （４）坚决反对发稿的无政府状态，健全审稿制度。
    这个错误对于我们是一个极重要的教育，我们决心改正错误，提高工作。
