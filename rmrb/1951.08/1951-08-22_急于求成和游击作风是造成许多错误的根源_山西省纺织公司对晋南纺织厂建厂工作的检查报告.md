Haste and Guerrilla Tactics Are the Root Causes of Many Errors
    --Inspection Report on the Construction Work of the Jinnan Textile Factory by the Shanxi Provincial Textile Company
    The construction work of the Jinnan Textile Factory has experienced many errors in planning, construction, and organization and leadership. However, due to the imperfect organization and leadership, no systematic inspection has been conducted since the factory was built, resulting in numerous opinions and mutual complaints from superiors and subordinates. In mid-July, the Industry Department of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government instructed the Shanxi Provincial Textile Company to be responsible for the inspection. The company officially convened a meeting of relevant construction personnel on July 26 and conducted a relatively systematic inspection.
  I. Basic Situation of Preparations for Factory Construction
    In April 1950, the factory's preparatory committee was established with an investment of 3.7 million catties of millet, which was later increased to 4.5 million catties. The preparatory committee was divided into four groups: construction, procurement, secretarial, and study. After surveying and research, it was decided to restore and build on the old site of the former Dayicheng Yarn Factory in Xinjiang. The construction group immediately went to the factory; the procurement group went to Shanghai to order machines; and the study group went to the factory for internships. The preparatory committee itself was practically reduced to the secretarial group, and it was located in Taiyuan, 690 li away from the current factory.
    Most of the members of the preparatory committee held concurrent positions. In reality, only one person was in charge of the preparatory committee. There was a period when this one person was also away on official business, and the preparatory committee became an empty shell, with no one to respond to requests from subordinates. When the preparatory committee held meetings, most of the members sent representatives to attend, and the director only attended one meeting.
    The Industry Department's leadership over the preparatory committee was also insufficient, only entrusting the administrative section to be responsible. However, the administrative section itself was limited by its authority and could hardly play a comprehensive leading role.
    Regarding the scale of the factory, there were also few clear instructions. Whether it was 20,000 spindles or 10,000 spindles, whether to open a weaving machine this year or not, there were various rumors and no consensus. Written instructions were consistently lacking.
    In May of last year, the site survey began, and it was requested that the civil engineering be completed in 100 days. Later, due to inadequate preparation, construction did not begin until September. However, the preparatory committee proposed that the project be completed before October 5, striving to start production in February 1951. The higher authorities demanded urgency, and the lower levels were busy rushing to work, but production has not yet started to this day. Many complex issues were not anticipated in advance.
    In February of this year, the Shanxi Provincial Textile Company was established. The Jinnan Textile Factory was placed under the leadership of the company, and the preparatory committee dissolved informally. These two leading bodies did not conduct a formal handover, resulting in the textile company's insufficient understanding and assistance to the Jinnan Textile Factory. However, the basic construction work was already "a thing of the past."
    Judging from the above situation, there was a serious tendency of haste and guerrilla tactics from top to bottom regarding the construction task of the Jinnan Textile Factory. A series of problems occurred, mostly based on this root cause.
  II. Specific Inspection of Basic Construction Work
    1. The guidelines and plans were not clear enough.
    "Construction is impossible without a correct engineering design." Did the Jinnan Textile Factory have an engineering design? Yes. Were there plans? Yes. The problem was that the plans were never confirmed, and the design was divorced from reality. For example, the funding was decided, but what was the actual scale of production? How would the equipment be installed now? When would it be expanded again? There was a lack of clear regulations. Due to the uncertainty of the production scale, the design work also changed several times. Some advocated restoring the old factory (the factory had more than 1,400 old workshops and dormitories, but most needed repair) in order to first meet the standard of 10,000 spindles for spinning and weaving; others advocated building the factory according to the future development of 20,000 spindles for spinning and weaving. It was not until July 1950 that it was determined to build the factory according to the needs of 20,000 spindles.
    2. The design was simple, and the contract was poorly drawn up.
    After the guidelines and plans were decided, civil engineering design work was carried out and contracts were signed. The project was divided into four major items: (1) Building a boiler roof. (2) Repairing 100 factory buildings and building 98 new ones. (3) Building and repairing 170 warehouses. (4) Building 500 new dormitories. Other projects were handled by the factory itself.
    The design was done by several public construction companies who estimated the labor and materials and made a budget (the survey was simple, and the design was rough). The company that was cheaper was contracted. After review, it was found that contracting out completely was not as cost-effective as semi-contracting, so a contract was signed with Xin'da Construction Company. The contract stipulated that the factory would provide the materials, and Xin'da would supervise the construction. A reward of one catty of rice per labor day would be paid for the total amount of labor, with bonuses for savings and penalties for waste. What problems did this approach create? First, the more labor, the greater the reward. At the meeting for review, one comrade said: "Xin'da was hired by the factory and should stand on the side of the factory, but in many things, it was opposed to the factory." The poorly drawn-up contract cannot be one of the reasons for the opposition. Second, the contract stipulated that Xin'da would supervise the materials. However, during construction, Xin'da's materials were purchased, resulting in the purchase of poor-quality timber, which was also accepted, and much of the timber delayed construction. Third, Xin'da supervised the construction and subcontracted the work to workers found by Xin'da. The 200 weaving factory buildings were built crookedly, even worse than the old ones. Fourth, the biggest defect of the contract was that it did not specify a warranty period.
    Why did this phenomenon occur? (1) It was believed that since everyone was public, they were reliable. (2) Xin'da was cheaper than other companies. (3) It was believed that "Xin'da knows, we don't," so the inspection and acceptance were not taken seriously, and Xin'da was entrusted to purchase materials with an advance payment of more than 200 million yuan, and the case has not been closed to this day with tens of millions of yuan still owed.
    After the preparatory committee signed a contract with Xin'da Company, some comrades in the construction group were dissatisfied. Therefore, after Xin'da's people went to the factory, no one was in charge, resulting in chaos in the construction. The factory's civil engineer, Shi Xiushan, was used as a material receiver and distributor (because Xin'da was responsible for the engineering). Sometimes, Shi Xiushan saw that the materials were too bad and raised objections, but the leadership ignored them (wrongly believing that Xin'da was sent by the higher authorities, abandoning the factory's leadership), which offended Xin'da's people and created a deep contradiction between Xin'da Company's personnel and Shi Xiushan, almost leading to fights.
    Our experience is that basic construction must have an enterprise-oriented mindset. The "selfless" "big public family ideology" is essentially a remnant of the supply system. Facts have proven that this ideology is harmful when applied to enterprises.
    3. Poor planning, lax construction, frequent changes, and alarming waste.
    The construction of an engineering project should be organized after detailed design. Moreover, necessary preparations must be made before construction to ensure order. The engineering plan should be carefully decided. However, once it has been decided, it is best not to change it. If changes are necessary, the reasons should be clearly stated and approved by the higher authorities before making changes. The Jinnan Textile Factory did not do this completely. After the four major projects were decided, many changes were made during construction. For example, the 98 factory buildings were changed to 140, the 500 dormitory cave dwellings were changed to 50, and 94 tile houses were added, etc. These changes in plans disrupted the construction steps and material preparation work, resulting in many problems such as using without preparing, preparing without using, waiting for materials to stop work, and using large materials for small purposes, wasting a lot of funds.
    In addition, many old houses that could be used were demolished. Some were the responsibility of the factory, and some could not be blamed on the preparatory committee. For example, if the 100 old factory buildings were not demolished, 500,000 catties of rice could be used to repair them; demolishing them and building new ones would require 1.2 million catties of millet, which is equivalent to wasting 700,000 catties of rice. Another 83 dormitories and offices were demolished and 94 new ones were built; each new building cost an average of 8,000 catties of rice, and each repair cost an average of 4,000 catties of rice. Demolishing 83 houses is equivalent to wasting more than 330,000 catties of rice. As for the old materials and newly purchased materials that were demolished, due to poor management, the waste was alarming. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 440,000 catties of millet could not be found in the accounts.
    Due to the rush to work, the land was moved in winter, and the motor room roof and more than 270 rooms of the yarn factory were re-tiled, and the cement floor of the 40 cleaning factory was re-laid. These statistics alone wasted 380 million yuan. There were also other rework due to poor design.
    4. There are shortcomings in the machine ordering contract.
    The machine ordering problem is not big, but there are shortcomings in the contract. (1) It is best to include the number of days for installation in the contract to avoid delays. (2) The packing should be strict to avoid damage. (3) The contract should be strictly enforced to prevent private merchants from seeking extra profits under pretext.
    The transportation and storage of machines are very important organizational tasks. For example, after the factory's machines were transported to the station and the factory, the factory did not pay enough attention to storage, resulting in rain damage for many days, causing losses.
    The biggest problem with machines is power. To build a factory, the first thing to consider is the power problem. We have not studied this point enough. Some of the important work such as allocation, disassembly, drawing, overhaul, and installation has been done well, and some has been done very poorly. In particular, the conditions for electrical overhaul and installation were underestimated, the wishes were great, the strength was small, self-righteousness, and subjectivism took a detour and took the blame.
  III. Inspection of Organizational Leadership and Factory Construction Ideology
    From the perspective of the entire basic construction work, the most serious problem is civil engineering. The most prominent manifestation is waste. The reasons for waste are strict organization, poor management, poor planning, recklessness, haste, and the idea of building a large factory. In order to gain experience and lessons, we must find the root causes from organizational leadership and ideological leadership.
    1. Organizational Leadership
    From the perspective of higher-level leadership, the instructions and inspections of the factory construction plan are not enough. Such a complex and serious task cannot be accomplished by a preparatory committee whose members are mostly part-time. The construction team that went to the factory, except for one cadre who had worked in a yarn factory, the rest were old cadres from the army, institutions, or commercial production backgrounds. These comrades have a high enthusiasm for work and are good at planning; but they feel that it is difficult to cope with a job like building a factory. They are tight on small accounts, but cannot calculate large accounts. As some comrades said: "I don't even have the experience of building a chicken coop."
    The leadership of the factory construction lacks a core. The leaders of the construction team have different opinions, and the division of labor is not clear; or the division of labor is mechanical, each doing his own thing, not good at seeking consensus on divergent opinions at meetings, and not very good at organizing the masses. The chairman of the trade union said: "Not only do the workers not know about the basic construction plan, but the trade union does not know either." Because the leadership's opinions cannot be unified, the system is also chaotic and divorced from the masses. For example, subsidies such as wages, travel expenses, rent, and water and electricity are implemented in several ways in one factory, which makes employees very dissatisfied.
    Everyone's opinion can also be said to be experience: (1) Basic construction must be led by full-time agencies, cadres must not hold concurrent positions, and they must rely on the site. (2) The basic construction cadres must be equipped with leading backbones and supplemented by professional talents. (3) Leading cadres must be closely linked to the masses. The basic construction task is the same as the production task, and the task must be clearly explained to the masses in order to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses. (4) Necessary systems must be established. In addition to those promulgated by the higher-level leading agencies, the current factory leaders must be given the necessary powers to avoid asking for instructions on everything and hesitating.
    2. Ideological Leadership
    We believe that the primary guiding principle for restoring old factories should be: "What can be used must be used, and what cannot be used should not be forced to be used." Therefore, the demolition or non-demolition of old buildings must be determined according to their good or bad condition; repair or non-repair must be determined according to their role. If old buildings are demolished and new ones are built too easily, then restoration is not as good as new construction; if all repairs are made without demolition, it may not be suitable for machine installation. Therefore, the second principle should be: "The production part can be appropriately sophisticated, and the living part should be appropriately accommodating." The third principle: Economic accounting system should be mastered. Because the funds for restoring old factories are limited, we must be careful and divide them into urgent and slow, so that the funds can only be surplus, not insufficient. The fourth principle: We should move forward steadily, have a scientific spirit, and not act solely on subjective enthusiasm and wishes, and not have a simple task-oriented view.
    The following problems exist in the factory construction ideology of Jinnan Textile Factory:
    First, the idea of building a big factory that does not proceed from reality, likes to be big and likes to be successful, and emphasizes "beauty and neatness." For example, demolishing too many houses improperly is this idea at work.
    Second, there is a simple task-oriented view, recklessness, and haste. For example, the roof was removed and the floor was laid, and it was already winter, but we still had to rush to work, and the result was that we had to rework.
    Third, we only wanted to save money in small ways, but ignored the importance of the factory construction plan. We did not seek savings in the overall plan (did not compare and study several situations), but only wanted to save money in specific construction (did not consider whether changing the construction was right or wrong), and the result was that the workers suffered losses, and the factory also suffered losses."
    Why do the above ideas arise? Because most of the factory construction cadres come from the army and commercial production agencies, and they have no experience in building factories. Individual cadres who understand industry also have little experience in building factories. In addition, they have been in rural environments for a long time, and guerrilla habits and handicraft styles are more serious, which limits the comprehensiveness of ideological methods. Therefore, it is worse to calculate large accounts and fine to calculate small accounts; it is manifested in the style of personally doing things, being brave and responsible, but lacking planning and being very blind. It can be said that the country's funds have been wasted hard.

　　急于求成和游击作风是造成许多错误的根源
    ——山西省纺织公司对晋南纺织厂建厂工作的检查报告
    晋南纺织厂的建厂工作，无论在计划上施工上以及组织领导上均发生过许多错误。但由于组织领导不健全，从建厂至今没有作过系统的检查，以致意见纷纷，上下交相瞒怨。七月中旬山西省人民政府工业厅责成山西省纺织公司负责检查。该公司于七月二十六日正式召开有关建厂人员会议，比较系统地进行了检查。
  一、筹备建厂的基本情况
    一九五○年四月，该厂筹备委员会成立，投资小米三千七百万斤，以后又增为四千五百万斤。筹委会下分设建厂、采购、秘书、学习四组。经过勘查研究，决定利用新绛原大益成纱厂旧址恢复建设。建厂组当即下厂；采购组到上海定买机器；学习组相继下厂实习。筹委会本身实际只剩下秘书组，而且住在太原，距现厂相隔六百九十余华里。
    筹委会委员大部均是兼职。实际在筹委会负责的只有一人。曾有一个时期这一个人也因公外出，筹委会成了空架子，对下级的请示无人批复。筹委会开会委员们多请代表出席，主任委员只有一次会议到场。
    工业厅对筹委会的领导也是不够的，只委托行政处负责。而行政处本身因职权限制，也难以发挥全面的领导作用。
    关于厂的规模，也很少明确指示，究系两万锭或一万锭，本年开布机或不开布机，传说纷纭，莫衷一是。文字指示，一向阙如。
    去年五月开始勘查厂址，曾要求一百天完成土木工程。后因准备不周，九月份才动工。但筹委会又提出十月五号以前完工，争取一九五一年二月份开工。上级要求迫切，下级忙于赶工，但直至现在还未能开工，其中许多复杂问题，事先都没有估计到。
    今年二月，山西省纺织公司成立。晋南纺织厂划归公司领导，筹委会就无形解体了。这两个领导机关没有作过正式的交接，以致纺织公司对晋南纺织厂的问题了解不周，帮助不够。但基本建设工作已经是“明日黄花”了。
    从上述情况来看，对晋南纺织厂的建厂任务，自上而下，存在着严重的急于求成思想与游击作风。一系列问题的发生，恐大都是基于这个根源的。
  二、基本建设工作的具体检查
    １、方针计划不够明确。
    “没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工。”晋南纺织厂有没有工程设计呢？有的。计划也是有的。问题是计划从未肯定，设计脱离现实。譬如资金是决定了，生产规模究竟多大？现在如何设备？何时再行扩充？均缺乏明确规定。因生产规模的不肯定，设计工作也变更了数次。有的主张因陋就简恢复旧厂（该厂旧有工房宿舍等一千四百余间，但大部须整修）以先按一万锭纱布机为标准；有的则主张按将来发展两万锭纱布机建厂，至一九五○年七月才确定按两万锭的需要进行建厂。
    ２、设计简单，合同订得不妥。
    方针计划决定后，就进行土木工程设计工作并订立合同。工程共分四大项：（１）盖锅炉顶一座。（２）补修厂房一百间新建九十八间。（３）新补仓库一百七十间。（４）新建宿舍五百间。其他工程由厂自理。
    设计是找了几家公营建筑公司估工估料做出预算（勘查简单设计粗糙）谁家便宜，就包给谁家。经过审核，完全外包不如半包合算，所以与新大建筑公司订立合同。合同规定：厂方备料，新大监修。按工程总工数每工抽米一斤作为报酬费，节约有奖，浪费有罚。这种做法，产生了那些毛病呢？第一、费工愈多，报酬越大。这次会议检讨时，有的同志讲：“新大监修，好比是厂方请的，应该站在厂方，但许多事情却与厂对立。”合同订得不妥不能不是对立的原因之一。第二、合同规定新大监料。但施工中却买新大的料，以致买回的木料质量太差，也收用了，并有许多木料误了施工。第三、新大监修，新大代找工人包工，二百间布厂房子盖的七斜八歪，甚至不如旧的。第四、合同最大缺点是没规定保固年限。
    为什么会产生这种现象呢？（１）认为都是公家，可靠。（２）新大比别家便宜。（３）认为“新大懂，咱不懂”，于是检查验收就不够认真，并曾委托新大买料预付款两亿余元，直至现在尚欠数千万元不能结案。
    筹委会与新大公司订立合同后，建厂组的一部分同志是不满意的。所以新大的人下厂后，形成无人领导，造成了施工中的混乱状态。厂内土木工程师石秀山被用作材料收发员（因工程上有新大负责）。有时石秀山看到材料太坏提出意见，领导上也不理（错误的认为新大是上级派来的，放弃了厂的领导），反得罪了新大的人，造成新大公司人员与石秀山的深刻矛盾，几致打架。
    我们的经验是：从事基本建设必须具有企业化思想，“不分你我”的“大公家思想”实质上是供给制的思想残余。事实证明，这种思想用到企业方面是有害的。
    ３、计划不周，施工不严，变化多端，浪费惊人。
    一种工程的建设，应该是经过详细设计后再组织施工的。而且在施工之前，必须作好必要的准备工作，才能做到有条不紊。工程计划是应该慎重决定的。但既经决定之后，最好以不改变为宜。如必须改变时，也应陈明理由，经上级批准再改。晋南纺织厂却没有完全这样做。四大工程决定后，施工中改变了不少。如厂房九十八间改为一百四十间，宿舍窑洞五百间改为五十间，增修瓦房九十四间等等。这些计划的改变，打乱了施工步骤与材料准备工作，产生了用而不备、备而不用、停工待料及大材小用等许多毛病，浪费了不少资金。
    除此以外，能够利用的旧房屋也拆了不少。有些是厂里负责，有些是筹委会也不能辞其咎。如一百间旧厂房如果不拆，有五十万斤米可以修起；拆了新建，则需小米一百二十万斤。等于浪费资金米七十万斤。又拆了宿舍和办公室共八十三间，新盖了九十四间；新盖平均每间按八千斤米计，补修平均每间按四千斤米计，拆了八十三间房子，等于浪费资金米三十三万余斤。至于拆下来的旧料与新买物料，因管理不善，也浪费惊人。根据初步统计，查不出账的共合小米四十四万余斤。
    因忙于赶工，冬季动土又返工的，计电机房顶与纱厂二百七十余间房顶重新揭瓦，四十间清花厂的洋灰地板重打，仅这几宗统计浪费资金三亿八千余万元。其他因设计不周而返工的也还有。
    ４、机器定货合同有缺点。
    机器定货问题不大，但合同上有缺点。（１）定合同最好把安装天数包括进去，以免延误时间。（２）装箱应要求严格，以免损坏。（３）执行合同应严格，防止私商借故谋取额外利润。
    机器的运输与保管，是很重要的组织工作。如该厂机器运到车站和厂内后，厂内对保管不够重视，致雨淋多日，受到损失。
    机器方面最大的问题是动力。要建一个工厂，首先应考虑到动力问题。我们对这一点是研究得不够的。从调拨、拆卸、绘图、检修、安装等一系列的重要工作，有些做的较好，有些做的很差。特别是对电力检修安装条件估计不足，愿望大，力量小，自以为是，主观主义，走了弯路背了工。
  三、组织领导与建厂思想的检查
    从整个基本建设工作来说，问题最严重的是土木工程。表现最突出的是浪费。浪费形成的原因，是组织不严，管理不善，计划不周，轻率从事，急于求成，和建大厂的思想。为了取得经验教训，须从组织领导与思想领导找寻根源。
    １、组织领导方面
    从上级领导上讲，对于建厂计划的指示与检查是不够的。这样一件复杂而严重的任务，由大部分委员是兼职的筹委会去领导，是不能胜任的。下了厂的建厂组，除一个干部是办过纱厂的以外，其余都是过去部队或机关商业生产出身的老干部。这些同志工作热情是高的，也长于打算；但对建厂这样一件工作，就感觉难以应付了。小账扣的紧，大账算不来。正如某些同志所说：“连盖个鸡窝的经验也是没有的。”
    建厂的领导是缺乏核心的。建厂的正副组长意见不统一，分工不明确；或机械分工，各行其是，不善于在会议上把分歧的意见求得一致，也没有很好地组织群众。工会主席说：“基本建设计划，不只工人群众不知道，工会也不知道。”由于领导意见的不能统一，反映到制度上也是混乱的，并且是脱离群众的。如工资、旅费、房租、水电等津贴，一个厂实行数种办法，职工大为不满。
    大家的意见，也可说是经验：（１）基本建设必须有专职机关领导，干部不可兼职，并且要依靠现场。（２）配备基本建设干部必须有领导骨干，并辅以专业人才。（３）领导干部必须紧密连系群众。基本建设任务与生产任务一样，必须将任务明确交代给群众，才能发挥群众的积极性。（４）必要的制度必须建立，除上级领导机关已颁行者外，须给现厂领导者以必要权力，免得事事请示、束足不前。
    ２、思想领导方面
    我们认为，恢复旧厂的首要的指导原则，应该是：“能利用的必须利用，不能利用的不勉强利用。”故对旧建筑物的拆与不拆，须视其好坏程度而定；修与不修，须视其作用大小而定。如轻于拆旧盖新，则恢复就不如新建；如绝对不拆全修，也许不适合机器的安装。所以，第二个原则应该是：“生产部分可适当讲究，生活部分应适当将就。”第三个原则：应掌握经济核算制。因为恢复旧厂的资金是有限的，必须精打细算，分开缓急只能使资金有余，不能使资金不足。第四个原则：应该稳步前进，具有科学精神，不能光凭主观热情与愿望办事，不能有单纯的任务观点。
    而晋南纺织厂的建厂思想上则存在以下几种问题：
    第一、不从实际出发的建大厂思想，好大喜功，讲究“美观整齐”。如过多地不妥善地拆房子，就是这个思想在作怪。
    第二、有单纯任务观点，轻率从事，急于求成。如揭瓦铺地，已临冬季，还要赶工，结果还是得返工。
    第三、只从小处想省钱，但忽视了建厂计划的重要性。不是在总的计划上求节约（没有从几种情况上对比研究），而仅是在具体施工中想省钱（没有考虑变更施工对不对），结果是工人吃亏，厂方也受损失”。
    为什么会产生以上思想呢？因为建厂干部大都来自部队与商业生产机关，对建设工厂是没经验的。个别懂得工业的干部建设工厂的经验也少。加上过去都是长期处在农村环境，游击习气与手工业作风比较严重，限制了思想方法的全面性。所以算大账较差，算小账精细；表现在作风上是亲自动手，勇于负责，但缺乏计划，盲目性很大。这可以说是辛辛苦苦地浪费了国家不少资金。
