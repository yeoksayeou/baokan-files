Xinhua News Agency reporter Men Hong:

　　Delegates from all over the country attending the Qingdao Cotton Spinning Fine Yarn Worker Representative Conference visited the state-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, where Hao Jianxiu works, on the morning of the 18th. The delegates originally thought that implementing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method would mean a very tense working environment and workers sweating profusely… However, when they entered Hao Jianxiu's workshop, the situation was completely different from what they had expected. The work seemed very light and easy. In the discussion after the visit, the delegates from various places felt that the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was scientific and advanced both in theory and in practice. Its characteristic is that all work is aimed at reducing yarn breakage and shortening the flaring time of the rollers. Hao Jianxiu patrols her section in a regular manner. She is good at mastering working time, allocating various tasks to each patrol in a planned way, and using the saved time to do more cleaning work. Therefore, she not only reduces yarn breakage but also makes her work light and easy.

　　The delegates from various places highly praised the unique aspects of individual movements in the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. These are all created by Hao Jianxiu through a long period of humbly learning the operational advantages of veteran workers and analyzing and synthesizing them. The representatives from Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan and other places were amazed at how accurately she could calculate the time when they saw Hao Jianxiu changing roving. Su Xiuzhen, a representative from the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, said: "I saw that when there were only four circles of roving left on a yarn tube on Hao Jianxiu's machine, she did not change it immediately, but continued to patrol her section from right to left in a regular manner. The more I looked, the more anxious I became for her. Why didn't she change it? But when she patrolled around once and then went to change it, the four circles of roving were just about to run out. She immediately used a flexible technique to replace the pre-prepared roving, and the joint was short and even."

　　After seeing Hao Jianxiu's demonstration, some representatives' conservative ideas were also eliminated. Cai Shuying, a veteran technician from Tianjin Beiyang Yarn Factory, heard in the reading group in June this year that Hao Jianxiu had created a new national record for low roller flaring. At that time, she felt that Hao Jianxiu was just a seventeen-year-old girl, and her age was only as long as her own years of service. Could she really create some advanced work method? Even on the way to Qingdao this time, she was still half-believing and half-doubting while sitting on the train. But after seeing Hao Jianxiu's demonstration, she said with emotion: "The Hao Jianxiu Work Method is really good! I must get rid of my conservative ideas and study hard!"

　　The delegates from various places expressed their determination after the visit to earnestly promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method to all parts of the country. Yan Jinfen, a national model worker representative from Shijiazhuang, said: "I will definitely promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method when I go back this time. During the promotion, we must pay special attention to persuading and mobilizing the masses of workers, tell everyone what we have seen with our own eyes, and break down all ideological obstacles in the promotion." The representative from southern Jiangsu presented Hao Jianxiu with a precious gift from Wuxi—a plaster statue of Chairman Mao—and warmly congratulated her, saying: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the creative wisdom of the working class be brought into play. We hope that you will always follow Chairman Mao."

### 把郝建秀工作法推广到全国！

　　把郝建秀工作法推广到全国！
    新华社记者  门宏
    从全国各地来参加青岛棉纺细纱职工代表会议的代表们，在十八日上午参观了郝建秀所在厂——国营青岛第六棉纺织厂。代表们原来都以为实行了郝建秀工作法，一定是工作很紧张、工人累得满头大汗……。可是，当他们一走进郝建秀的车间，情形却完全出乎他们意料之外，工作似乎很轻快。在参观后的座谈会上，各地代表们都感到郝建秀工作法无论在理论上或实际上都是科学的、先进的工作法。它的特点是一切工作都为了减少断头和缩短开花时间。郝建秀在车档里巡回是有规律的。她善于掌握工作时间，把各项工作有计划地分配在每一次巡回中，把节约下来的时间用来多做清洁工作，因而不但减少了断头，而且工作很轻快。
    各地代表们非常称赞郝建秀工作法中个别动作的独到之处。这些都是郝建秀长时期虚心学习老工人的操作优点并把它们分析综合创造出来的。上海、天津、武汉等地的代表看了郝建秀换粗纱的动作，都惊奇她能够把时间算得那样准确。国营天津第一棉纺织厂代表苏秀珍说：“我看到郝建秀的机台上有一个纱管仅剩下四圈粗纱时，她还不去换，仍在车档内自右向左有规律地巡回着。我越看越替她着急，为什么还不去换？可是等她巡回一周再去换时，那四圈粗纱却刚好快要完了，她即以灵活的手法马上把早已准备好的粗纱换上了，而且接体又短又匀。”
    参观郝建秀表演后，有些代表的保守观念也消除了。天津北洋纱厂的老技术工人蔡淑英，今年六月在读报小组里听说郝建秀创造了全国少出皮辊花的新纪录，当时她觉得郝建秀只不过是个十七岁的娃娃，这样的年纪不过和她的工龄一样长，难道还能真的创造出什么先进工作法吗？直到这次来青岛的途中，她坐在火车上还半信半疑。但当她看了郝建秀表演之后，她感慨地说道：“郝建秀工作法确是好啊！我一定要去掉保守思想，好好学习！”
    各地代表们在参观后都表示决心，要把郝建秀工作法认真地推广到全国各地。石家庄全国劳动模范代表阎金芬说：“这次回去一定推广郝建秀工作法。在推广时还要特别注意说服动员工人群众，把我们亲眼看到的事实告诉大家，打破推广中的一切思想障碍。”苏南代表把从无锡带来的宝贵礼物——毛主席的石膏像一座，赠送给郝建秀，并亲切地祝贺她说：“只有在共产党领导下，才能发挥工人阶级的创造智慧。盼望你永远跟着毛主席走。”
