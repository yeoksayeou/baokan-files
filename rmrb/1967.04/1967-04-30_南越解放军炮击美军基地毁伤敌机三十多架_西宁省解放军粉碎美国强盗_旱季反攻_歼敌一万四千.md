West Ninh Province Liberation Army Foils U.S. Aggressors' "Dry Season Counteroffensive," Annihilating 14,000 Enemy Troops

	New Delhi, April 29 — Saigon news: The armed forces of the South Vietnamese liberation forces launched a fierce artillery attack on the U.S. Marine Corps' Dong Ha and Phu Bai bases south of the demilitarized zone in the early hours of April 28. According to Western news agencies, over 30 aircraft were destroyed or damaged, and approximately 200 U.S. troops were killed or wounded.

	Reports indicate that the liberation forces launched a 45-minute barrage of mortar fire on the U.S. Marine Corps' Dong Ha base. Ten helicopters and two transport planes parked on the runway were damaged, many U.S. barracks and trucks were hit and set on fire, and many U.S. invaders, startled from their sleep, fled from the burning barracks only to be killed or wounded by the artillery fire.

	At the same time, the liberation forces also shelled the U.S. Marine Corps' Phu Bai base, destroying or damaging 20 helicopters and killing or wounding many enemy troops.

	Reports also indicate that in recent days, the liberation forces have launched continuous and fierce attacks on U.S. Marine Corps in this region. On April 26, the liberation forces attacked a position of a U.S. Marine Corps special task force stationed in Khe Sanh, killing or wounding at least 110 enemy troops.

	On the same day, the liberation forces ambushed a U.S. Marine Corps engineering convoy 24 kilometers northwest of Quang Tri, killing or wounding many enemy troops with small arms and mortar fire. Near the aforementioned location, a U.S. Marine Corps company was also ambushed by liberation forces hidden in well-prepared positions, resulting in many casualties.

	Hanoi, April 29 — The armed forces of the South Vietnamese liberation forces, with high morale and ingenuity, have fully demonstrated the immense power of people's war. Recently, they have thoroughly foiled the U.S. aggressors' "dry season counteroffensive" in the key region of West Ninh Province.

	The South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency recently issued a communiqué from the South Eastern Zone Liberation Forces Command, stating that from February 2 to April 13 over two months, the liberation forces in West Ninh Province annihilated nearly 14,000 U.S. and puppet troops, the majority of whom were Americans. Among the annihilated enemy troops were two infantry battalions and 18 companies, two artillery battalions and five companies, and nine mechanized companies. In addition, three infantry battalions, one paratrooper battalion, and one artillery battalion were mostly annihilated.

	At the same time, the liberation forces also destroyed or damaged over 1,000 vehicles of various types, including 801 tanks and armored vehicles, 167 aircraft, and over 90 heavy artillery pieces.

	The communiqué states that after more than two months of intense fighting, by April 13, all remaining U.S. and puppet troops that had been gathered to launch large-scale "sweeps" against West Ninh Province had been driven out of the province.
