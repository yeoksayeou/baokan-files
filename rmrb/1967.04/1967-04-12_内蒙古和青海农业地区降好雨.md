	The vast majority of regions in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region experienced rainfall in early April. After the rain, drought conditions in some areas have been alleviated, and in most areas, the drought has shown signs of easing.

	This round of rainfall ranged from a minimum of 1 millimeter to a maximum of 20 millimeters. Currently, the drought in regions such as Chifeng, Xilin Gol League, Hohhot, and Baotou has been largely alleviated. Except for the Hulunbuir League in the Greater Khingan Range, the drought conditions in other regions of Inner Mongolia have also improved.

	According to the Xinhua News Agency in Xining, the agricultural regions of the Qinghai Plateau recently received several good rains. The counties most prone to drought, such as Minhe, received more rainfall, providing favorable conditions for the sowing and germination of spring wheat and barley, as well as for afforestation.
