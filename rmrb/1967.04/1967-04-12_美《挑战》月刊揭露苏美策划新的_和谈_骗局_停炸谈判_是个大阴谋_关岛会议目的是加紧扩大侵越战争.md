	American "Challenge" magazine, the organ of the Progressive Labor Party, published an article in its April issue strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership for helping the United States peddle the "peace talks" deception and betraying the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression. The article demands that the United States get out of Vietnam immediately.

	The article points out that the so-called "bombing halt negotiations" are a new conspiracy hatched by the new reactionary axis of Washington and Moscow in collusion.

	The article says, "The Johnson clique has intensified its bombing of North Vietnam and is shipping in more arms (to South Vietnam). The United States convened the Guam conference to step up this war and plot the invasion of North Vietnam."

	The article exposes that the so-called "bombing halt negotiations" are completely a deception. This is: "As long as the aggressor does not carry out bombing, it has the right to invade a country."

	The article emphasizes, "The United States has been beaten black and blue by the heroic Vietnamese people. The invincible people's war has caused the U.S. imperialists to suffer repeated defeats. U.S. imperialism has exhausted all its elite troops, while the people's fighters are growing stronger with each battle." The article says, "Vietnam has repeatedly proven that people's war is invincible." "The Trojan horse is revisionism, and its stronghold is in Moscow. The U.S. ruling class hopes to obtain through the betrayal of the Soviet revisionists what it cannot get on the battlefield."

	The article says: "The Vietnamese people are stronger than the imperialists. They will not allow the betrayal of the Soviet revisionists and their followers to sabotage the Vietnamese people's struggle."

	The article says: "The only correct demand is for the United States to get out of Vietnam immediately!"

    美《挑战》月刊揭露苏美策划新的“和谈”骗局
    “停炸谈判”是个大阴谋
    关岛会议目的是加紧扩大侵越战争
    新华社伦敦九日电　美国进步劳工党机关刊《挑战》四月号一期中发表文章，强烈谴责苏修领导集团帮助美国兜售“和谈”骗局，出卖越南人民的抗美救国斗争。文章要求美国立即滚出越南。
    文章指出，所谓“停炸谈判”，是新的反革命轴心华盛顿和莫斯科互相勾结策划出来的一个阴谋。
    文章说，“约翰逊集团已经加强了对越南（北方）的轰炸，并且向（南越）运进更多的军火”。美国“召开关岛会议是为了加紧这场战争，策划侵略越南北方。”
    文章揭露说，所谓“停炸谈判”完全是一个骗局。这就是：“侵略者只要不进行轰炸就有权对一个国家进行侵略。”
    文章强调说，“美国被英勇的越南人民打得鼻青脸肿。不可战胜的人民战争使美帝国主义遭到节节失败。美帝国主义已用尽了它全部精锐部队，而人民战士则越战越强。”文章说，“越南已经再三证明，人民战争是不可战胜的。”“特洛伊木马是修正主义，它的大本营在莫斯科。美国统治阶级希望通过苏修的叛卖，得到它在战场上不能得到的东西。”
    文章说：“越南人民比帝国主义更强大。决不允许苏修及其追随者的叛卖行为破坏越南人民的斗争。”
    文章说：“唯一正确的要求是美国立即滚出越南！”
