During the "revolutionize and promote production" campaign in rural areas, there are countless tasks to handle. What is the key to success? The experience of Hongjin Production Brigade in Shaxi People's Commune, Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, shows that the fundamental task is to vigorously promote the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, thereby revolutionizing people's thinking. Their practice proves that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. Poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres believe: among all the tasks, the first and foremost is to revolutionize people's thinking; among all the difficulties, having Mao Zedong Thought makes everything possible.

In the past, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Taicang County Party hated to see the masses studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought as much as bats fear the sunlight. They slandered peasants' study of Chairman Mao's works as "formalism." During the Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjin Production Brigade exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of these anti-revolutionary revisionists who opposed Mao Zedong Thought. Through the struggle, they deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the previous stage of the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses criticized brigade cadres who had made varying degrees of mistakes. Some cadres were disheartened and reluctant to lead the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The poor and lower-middle peasants posted big-character posters to the cadres, asking why they did not focus on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and why they did not address active thoughts. After discussions, the revolutionary cadres of the brigade welcomed the poor and lower-middle peasants' criticism and took the lead in promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works together with them.

The busier, the more we should study Chairman Mao's works

After the spring plowing began, some cadres mistakenly thought that the current priority was spring production, and the cultural revolution could be put on hold; during the busy season, production was the top priority, and studying Chairman Mao's works could be relaxed. This wrong idea was criticized during the study of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country." The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's call to "revolutionize and promote production" was not to stop the revolution and focus on production; studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the lifeline and cannot be relaxed for a moment. We must be busy with a clear direction, and studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the direction. Focusing only on production and being busy to the point of confusion will turn into confusion. The busier and the more difficulties, the more active thoughts there will be, and the more we need to study Chairman Mao's works.

After going through a period of struggle, Hongjin Production Brigade consciously put the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work, using the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought to guide all production activities.

They turned the fields into a large school for studying Mao Zedong Thought. They implemented the "four to the field": Mao's quotations board to the field; praising good people and deeds to the field; revolutionary songs to the field; and reading newspapers to the field.

The quotations on the board were updated regularly according to the situation and the changes in the thoughts of the cadres and commune members. When production encountered serious difficulties, the board would display: "Resolutely decide to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." When someone did not pay attention to quality, the board would display: "In the world, the most feared thing is the word 'serious,' and the Communist Party is the most serious." Chairman Mao's instructions, written on the board, were imprinted in the hearts of the commune members. With the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they worked hard, overcame all difficulties, and made the spring plowing production even better.

Each production team used field blackboards to praise good people and deeds, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and effectively promote spring plowing production. The fourth production team's militiaman Sun Yonghua, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on the model role of the militia, took the lead in production. He and another commune member worked together on a boat to dredge mud, exceeding the quota by a large margin, and then voluntarily took on other farm work. Later, he further improved the dredging efficiency by a factor of two. The production team seized this living example and promptly praised it on the field blackboard, initiating a mass movement to learn from Sun Yonghua, creating a wave of emulation and learning from advanced examples, greatly accelerating the production pace.

In the fields of Hongjin Production Brigade, the spring breeze blew strongly, red flags fluttered, and revolutionary songs echoed. Wherever the commune members worked, the quotation boards followed. They all carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them. They sang: "With the Little Red Book in our hearts, it's like the sun rising; the red book warms our hearts, and we stride forward." During rest times, they studied with specific questions in mind. When they discovered good people and deeds, they immediately wrote about them on the field blackboard. What a lively political scene!

Treating political and ideological work as the top priority

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Hongjin Production Brigade followed Chairman Mao's teachings that politics is the commander and the soul, making political and ideological work and mobilizing people's enthusiasm the top priority during the busy spring plowing period. With Mao's works and the party's policies as weapons, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants solved their own and the cadres' ideological problems. The political team leader of the eleventh production team, Zhu Hugeng, had been criticized by the masses in the previous stage of the Cultural Revolution and developed the idea that being a cadre was a "disadvantage." The young pioneer Wang Liyuan repeatedly took the initiative to talk to Zhu Hugeng, studying Chairman Mao's quotations on serving the people with him, saying: "Dr. Norman Bethune traveled thousands of miles to China, dedicating himself entirely to the Chinese people, and never felt 'disadvantaged.' The masses elected you as the team leader, so shouldn't you serve the people wholeheartedly? How can you talk about 'disadvantage'? The masses' criticism is to remove your selfishness and pull you out of the mud of bourgeois ideology, so you can better serve the people." Zhu Hugeng's mind was enlightened, and he actively stood up, vigorously promoting spring plowing production.

The "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" is a call to arms and a mobilization order for "revolutionizing and promoting production." Hongjin Production Brigade treated this letter as a great political motivation to mobilize the masses. They repeatedly propagated and studied it, truly making it known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres all expressed their determination to remember the party's letter in their minds and put it into action. The brigade's militia meeting decided to carry out Chairman Mao's and the party's call with actual actions, playing a leading, model, and backbone role among the masses. Each production team organized commune members to repeatedly study and discuss during evenings and rest times. The field blackboards also excerpted the main contents of the letter. The children's propaganda team, organized by the "Little Trumpet," became active in the village every evening. They recited the party's letter, bringing Chairman Mao's voice to the commune members' doorsteps. The sixty-year-old poor peasant Gu Xingtang from the first production team, who was illiterate, had her husband read the letter to her every day until she memorized it. She went to work early and returned late, leading in production labor. She said: "We commune members will work hard, and by the time of the autumn harvest, we will present the highest yield to Chairman Mao and reply to Chairman Mao's letter!" This old poor peasant spoke the hearts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hongjin Production Brigade.

On the basis of further revolutionizing their thinking, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members for production reached an unprecedented height. Dredging mud with boats is a heavy and technical task that women in this brigade had never done before. During this spring plowing period, many women broke the tradition and actively participated in dredging mud on the boats. The commune members voluntarily went to work early and returned late, greatly improving labor efficiency and accelerating the production pace. One thousand three hundred mu of wheat were fertilized two to three times, and two hundred twenty-four mu of rapeseed were fertilized two times and tilled three times. Other farm work also progressed quickly and well.

    在农村“抓革命，促生产”的高潮中主要抓什么？
    把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位
    洪泾大队的贫下中农和革命干部认为：千条万条，人的思想革命化是第一条；千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就不难。
    本报讯　在广大农村“抓革命，促生产”的高潮中，文化大革命和春耕生产工作千头万绪，抓住什么才算抓住了根本？江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队的经验表明：根本的一条是狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化。他们的实践证明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。贫下中农和革命干部认为：千条万条，人的思想革命化是第一条；千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就不难。
    过去，太仓县党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，象蝙蝠怕见太阳一样，害怕广大群众学习和掌握毛泽东思想。他们污蔑农民学习毛主席著作是“形式主义”。在文化大革命中，洪泾大队的贫下中农揭发和批判了这一小撮反革命修正主义分子反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，在斗争中更加深切地体会到：毛泽东思想是贫下中农的命根子。
    在前一阶段的文化大革命中，革命群众对犯有不同程度错误的大队干部进行了批评。部分干部有些想不通，情绪不高，放弃了对群众性的活学活用毛主席著作运动的领导。贫下中农就给大队干部贴出大字报，质问为什么不抓活学活用毛主席著作？为什么不抓活思想？大队革命干部经过讨论之后，表示热烈欢迎贫下中农的批评，并且和他们一起把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动领导起来。
    越忙越要学毛主席著作
    春耕大忙开始以后，少数干部错误地认为：当前主要抓春耕生产，文化革命可以放一放；大忙季节生产要紧，学习毛主席著作可以松一松。这种错误思想，在学习《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》的过程中，受到了批判。贫下中农和革命干部一致认为：毛主席号召我们抓革命，促生产，决不是停革命，抓生产；活学活用毛主席著作是命根子，一时一刻都不能放松。忙要忙得有方向，活学活用毛泽东思想就是方向。只抓生产，忙得晕头转向就会变成糊涂人。越忙，困难越多，活思想也就越多，就越要学习毛主席著作。
    洪泾大队在经历了一段斗争之后，自觉地把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想统帅一切生产活动。
    他们把田间地头变成了学习毛泽东思想的大学校。他们实行了“四个到田头”：毛主席语录牌到田头；好人好事表扬到田头；革命歌曲到田头；读报到田头。
    语录牌上的毛主席语录，随着形势的发展和社员、干部思想的变化而经常更换。当生产上遇到比较严重的困难的时候，语录牌上就写着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”当有人干活不注意质量的时候，语录牌上就写着：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”毛主席的指示，写在语录牌上，印在社员的心上。他们以“只争朝夕”的革命精神埋头苦干，排除万难，把春耕生产搞得好上加好。
    各生产队利用田头黑板报，表扬好人好事，宣传毛泽东思想，有力地推动了春耕生产。第四生产队民兵孙永华，牢记毛主席关于民兵要起模范作用的教导，在生产中处处带头。他和另一个社员一起上船罱泥，在大大超过定额之后，还主动抢着干别的农活。后来他又进一步把罱泥工效提高了一倍。生产队抓住这个活生生的榜样，及时在田头黑板报上表扬，群众中开展了向孙永华学习的活动，掀起了一个群众性的比先进、学先进的热潮，大大加快了生产进度。
    在洪泾大队的田野上，春风劲吹，红旗飘扬，革命歌声嘹亮。社员劳动到哪里，语录牌放到哪里。社员们都随身带着《毛主席语录》。他们歌颂道：“胸中藏着语录本，好象心中太阳升；红书照得人心暖，迈开大步向前奔。”一到休息时间，就带着问题有的放矢地学习。发现好人好事，立即写上田头黑板报。好一派生动活泼的政治景象！
    把政治思想工作当做头等大事
    洪泾大队的贫下中农和革命干部，遵循毛主席的政治是统帅、是灵魂的教导，在春耕大忙期间，把做政治思想工作，调动人的积极因素，当做头等重要的大事。广大贫下中农以毛主席著作和党的方针政策为武器，解决自己和干部的思想问题。第十一生产队政治队长朱虎生，在前一阶段的文化大革命中受到过群众的批判，产生了当干部“吃亏”的思想。青年闯将王丽娟多次主动找朱虎生谈话，和他一起学习毛主席关于为人民服务的语录，对他说：“白求恩同志不远万里，来到中国，全心全意为中国人民服务，从来没有感到‘吃亏’。群众选你当队长，难道不应该好好地为人民服务吗？怎么谈得上‘吃亏’呢？群众给你提意见，是要去掉你的私心杂念，把你从资产阶级思想的臭泥坑中拉出来，更好地为人民服务。”朱虎生听了思想上开朗了，积极挺起腰杆，狠抓春耕生产。
    《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，是“抓革命，促生产”的号召书和动员令。洪泾大队把这封信当作发动群众的巨大的政治动力。他们反复宣传，认真学习，真正做到家喻户晓，深入人心。贫下中农和革命干部纷纷表示：一定要把党中央的这封信记在脑子里，用在行动上。大队民兵集会，决心以实际行动贯彻毛主席和党中央的号召，在群众中起带头作用、模范作用和骨干作用。各生产队利用晚上和劳动休息时间，组织社员反复学习、讨论。田头黑板报上也摘抄这封信的主要内容。少年儿童组织的“小喇叭”宣传队，一到傍晚就在村子里活跃起来了。他们朗诵党中央的信，把毛主席的声音送到社员家门口。第一生产队六十岁的老贫农顾杏娣一字不识，每天叫她老伴念这封信给她听，一直到把这封信记熟。她早出工，晚收工，生产劳动走在前头。她说：“我们社员加油干，到秋收的时候，拿出最高的产量向毛主席报喜，给毛主席回信！”这个老贫农说出了洪泾大队广大贫下中农的心里话。
    在思想进一步革命化的基础上，广大社员的生产积极性空前高涨。下船罱泥是重活又是技术活，这个大队的妇女从来没有干过。今年春耕期间，许多妇女破天荒地活跃在罱泥船上。社员们自觉地早出工、晚收工，劳动效率大大提高，生产进度日益加快。一千三百亩麦子普遍追肥两三次，二百二十四亩油菜普遍追肥两次，松土三次。其他农活也进展得又快又好。
