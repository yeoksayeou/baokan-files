	Put Chairman Mao's great call into action

	Workers and cadres of Workshop 7 of Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory formulate "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" pact

	Everyone has thrown themselves into intense yet joyful labor, racing against time, each pushing the other, and completing the first quarter's production plan seven days ahead of schedule

	Editor's Note: Recently, the red rebels of Workshop 7 of Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory have formulated a "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" pact, pushing the high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production to a new stage. This revolutionary action fully demonstrates the high level of self-awareness of the revolutionary faction in consolidating proletarian labor discipline after seizing power.

	"Advance the army, increase production by an inch, strengthen discipline, and the revolution will be invincible." Chairman Mao's teaching clearly points out the relationship between revolution and production, revolution and discipline: revolution is the locomotive that drives production forward, and discipline is the necessary condition for the victory of the revolution. The red rebels of this workshop have seriously implemented this brilliant teaching. They, together with all revolutionary comrades in the factory, have united into a disciplined revolutionary army, bravely seizing all power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. After seizing power, they found that a very few people had a slacking-off attitude, and immediately formulated a pact, implementing Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," turning it into organized and disciplined action. Old worker Tang Lin Ge said well: "Chairman Mao has given us the power, we can only do well and cannot do poorly, we cannot be half-hearted revolutionaries."

	We proletarian revolutionaries should be like the red rebels of this workshop, we should be thorough revolutionaries, not half-hearted revolutionaries. Therefore, after seizing power, we must even better hold power, and consciously strengthen organizational discipline, ensuring that the locomotive of revolution can smoothly drive production to advance rapidly.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, April 21: After studying the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres of All Factories and Mines in the Country," the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres of Workshop 7 of Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory, with the spirit of "seizing the day," have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call into action. They have formulated a "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" pact in conjunction with the specific situation of their workshop, thus pushing the high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production to a new stage.

	On January 18, after the red rebels of Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory seized power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the red rebels of Workshop 7 continued to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production. Since this year, they have completed their production tasks ahead of schedule and overfulfilled them every month, and each month has been better than the last. However, there were a very few people who had a slacking-off attitude after seizing power. The broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres were very dissatisfied with this phenomenon. Old worker Tang Lin Ge said: "Chairman Mao has given us the power, we can only do well and cannot do poorly, we cannot be half-hearted revolutionaries." At this time, the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres of All Factories and Mines in the Country" arrived at Workshop 7, greatly encouraging everyone. They said: "Our hearts' reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, understands us workers the best." They immediately studied and discussed this letter in conjunction with the specific situation of their workshop, and decided to formulate a workshop labor system according to the spirit of this letter. After repeated discussions throughout the workshop, they finally summarized six points:

	1. Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be a good worker of Chairman Mao.

	2. Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and with even greater enthusiasm, strive to be the best, and complete the state's production plan quickly, efficiently, and economically.

	3. Consolidate proletarian labor discipline, carry forward the "three-eighths" spirit, firmly guard the work post, work hard for eight hours, and persist in revolutionary activities during spare time.

	4. Implement streamlining and efficiency, mobilize the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, create production management methods for socialist enterprises, thoroughly eliminate bureaucratism, uproot the roots of capitalism and revisionism, and turn the workshop into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	5. Carry forward the glorious tradition of thrift and simplicity of the working class, economize on revolution, manage enterprises thriftily, and fight against all wasteful phenomena that squander national resources.

	6. Learn from the People's Liberation Army, take the People's Liberation Army as an example. Strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and strengthen the workshop's security work.

	After these six points were formulated, everyone unanimously named it the "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" pact, and wrote it on red paper, posting it in the middle of the workshop. During breaks, workers often go to look at it and memorize it, implementing it in their actions.

	This "pact" was born, immediately promoting the revolution and production of the entire workshop. The day after the "pact" was formulated, as soon as the work time arrived, all machines started up. Everyone threw themselves into intense yet joyful labor, racing against time, each pushing the other. The first quarter's state production plan for the entire workshop was completed seven days ahead of schedule.

	Influenced by Workshop 7, more than twenty units in the entire factory have launched a new high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production.

    把毛主席的伟大号召贯彻到实际行动中去
    哈尔滨林业机械厂七车间革命职工干部制订“抓革命促生产公约”
    人人投入了紧张而愉快的劳动，争分夺秒，你追我赶，提前七天完成一季度生产计划
    编者按：哈尔滨林业机械厂七车间的红色造反者，最近订出了“抓革命促生产公约”，把抓革命促生产的高潮推向了新阶段。这种革命行动，充分表现了革命派掌权后积极巩固无产阶级劳动纪律的高度的自觉性。
    “军队向前进，生产长一寸，加强纪律性，革命无不胜。”毛主席的这个教导，十分明确地指出了革命和生产、革命和纪律的关系：革命是带动生产前进的火车头，纪律是保证革命胜利的必要条件。这个车间的红色造反者，认真地执行了这一英明教导。他们和全厂的革命战友团结成有纪律的革命大军，奋勇从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺回一切大权。他们在掌权后发现极个别的人有松劲情绪，立即订出公约，把毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的号召，落实下来，成为有组织有纪律的行动。老工人谈林阁说得好：“毛主席把大权交给了我们，我们只能干好不能干坏，我们不能当半截子革命派。”
    我们无产阶级革命派，就应当象这个车间的红色造反者一样，要做彻底的革命派，不当“半截子革命派”。因此，夺权后更要掌好权，更要自觉地加强组织纪律性，确保革命这个火车头能够顺利地带动生产飞速前进。
    据新华社哈尔滨二十一日电　哈尔滨林业机械厂七车间的革命职工和革命干部，学习了《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》以后，用“只争朝夕”的精神，把毛主席和党中央的伟大号召坚决地贯彻到实际行动中去，他们结合本车间具体情况订出了“抓革命促生产公约”，从而把抓革命促生产的高潮推向新阶段。
    一月十八日哈尔滨林业机械厂红色造反者夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权之后，七车间的红色造反者继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓革命，猛促生产，今年以来月月提前超额完成生产任务，而且一月比一月完成得好。但是，也有极个别的人，在夺权后产生了松劲情绪。广大革命职工和革命干部对这种现象非常不满。老工人谈林阁说：“毛主席把大权交给了我们，我们只能干好不能干坏，我们不能当半截子革命派。”正在这个时候，《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》传到了七车间，使大家受到极大的鼓舞。他们说：“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席最了解我们工人的心。”他们立即结合本车间的情况，反复学习和讨论了这封信，并决定根据这封信的精神，订出一个抓革命、促生产的车间劳动制度。全车间经过反复讨论，最后归纳了六条：
    一、读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好工人。
    二、坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地完成国家生产计划。
    三、巩固无产阶级劳动纪律，发扬“三八”作风，坚守工作岗位，干满干好八小时，坚持业余时间闹革命。
    四、实行精兵简政，发动群众，集中群众智慧，创造社会主义企业的生产管理办法，彻底铲除官僚主义，挖掉资本主义和修正主义的根子，把车间办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    五、发扬工人阶级的艰苦朴素的光荣传统，节约闹革命，勤俭办企业，向一切浪费国家资财的不良现象作斗争。
    六、大学解放军，以解放军为榜样。加强无产阶级专政，加强车间的安全保卫工作。
    这六条订出以后，大家一致把它取名为“抓革命促生产公约”，并且把它写在红纸上，张贴在车间正中间。休息时，工人们经常前去看一看，背一背，把它贯彻到自己的行动中去。
    这个“公约”一诞生，就推动了全车间的革命和生产。“公约”制订后的第二天，上班的时间一到，所有的机器都开动起来了。人人投入了紧张而愉快的劳动，争分夺秒，你追我赶。全车间第一季度的国家生产计划，提前七天完成了。
    全厂二十几个单位，在七车间的影响下，掀起了抓革命，促生产的新高潮。
