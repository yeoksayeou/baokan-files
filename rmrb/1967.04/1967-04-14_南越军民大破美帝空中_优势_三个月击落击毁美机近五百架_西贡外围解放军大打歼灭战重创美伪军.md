The military and people of South Vietnam have not only beaten the U.S. aggressors on the ground, but have also dealt heavy blows to the U.S. air pirates, achieving brilliant results in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. According to incomplete statistics, in the first three months of this year, the military and people of South Vietnam shot down or destroyed 497 U.S. aircraft of various types.

The report said that since the beginning of this year, the number of U.S. aircraft shot down or destroyed by the military and people of South Vietnam has been increasing month by month. In January, the military and people of South Vietnam shot down 59 U.S. aircraft, while in February and March, the number increased to 438, including many jet fighters and large helicopters.

The military and people of South Vietnam fought bravely and intelligently against the U.S. air pirates, shooting accurately. Therefore, they often shot down multiple U.S. aircraft in a short time. For example, on February 15, the military and people of Kien Giang Province shot down 10 U.S. aircraft in a battle near the city of Vinh Long. The military and people of Binh Dinh Province shot down 180 U.S. aircraft of various types from February 3 to early April, killing hundreds of U.S. aggressors on board. On March 31 alone, in a battle on the Saigon River, the military and people of Binh Dinh Province shot down or destroyed 12 U.S. aircraft.

The military and people of the Quang Tri - Thua Thien region shot down or destroyed 49 U.S. aircraft in February and March, setting a new record for the number of U.S. aircraft shot down per month on the Quang Tri - Thua Thien battlefield.

The military and people of Binh Dinh Province, in their brave battles alongside the military and people of the Central Highlands, shot down or destroyed nearly 70 U.S. aircraft in the Lai Giang area and the Dac Lac base from the end of January to early February.

The liberation armed forces of South Vietnam have recently fought several brilliant annihilation battles around Saigon, annihilating a large number of U.S. puppet troops.

According to a report from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, on the night of March 31, the liberation armed forces of Gia Dinh Province launched a fierce attack on the camp of the puppet 37th Regiment in Phu Tho Commune, Go Vap District, causing the enemy to fall into chaos. In just a few hours, they annihilated two enemy companies and heavily defeated another company, killing or wounding nearly 300 enemy troops.

In the province of Tien Giang, the local forces and guerrillas of De Tho District have been very active. From March 17 to 30, they foiled a major "sweep" by U.S. puppet troops. When the 2,000 U.S. aggressors and two battalions, five companies of puppet troops entered the liberated area, they immediately fell into the people's war of annihilation. The brave and intelligent local forces and guerrillas fought closely together, annihilating 600 enemy troops in more than ten days, including 450 U.S. aggressors.

On March 21, the liberation armed forces of Binh Duong Province ambushed a company of puppet troops that came to "sweep" in the northeast region of Thu Duc. After a 30-minute battle, they annihilated the entire company of enemy troops. The next day, the enemy, unwilling to admit defeat, air-dropped two companies of puppet troops into the area. But as soon as the enemy landed, the liberation armed forces surrounded and attacked them, quickly annihilating one company and heavily defeating another company. The remaining enemy troops fled in disarray.

    南越军民大破美帝空中“优势”
    三个月击落击毁美机近五百架
    西贡外围解放军大打歼灭战重创美伪军
    新华社河内十三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方军民在抗美救国斗争中，不仅把地面上的美国侵略军打得落花流水，同时沉重地打击了美国空中强盗，取得了辉煌的战果。据不完全的统计，在今年头三个月中，南方军民共击落击毁美国强盗各种类型飞机四百九十七架。
    报道说，今年以来，越南南方军民击落、击毁的美国飞机逐月增多。一月份，越南南方军民击落美国飞机五十九架，而二、三两个月份就增加到四百三十八架，其中包括许多喷气式战斗机和大型直升飞机。
    越南南方军民在同美国强盗飞机进行战斗时，英勇机智，射击准确。因此，往往经过短时间的战斗，就击落多架美机。例如芹苴省军民二月十五日在渭清市附近的一次战斗中，一开始就击落美机十架。西宁省军民从二月三日到四月初的两个月内，共击落各种类型美机一百八十架，消灭机上的美国侵略军成百名。其中仅三月三十一日在帅握河的一次战斗中，西宁省军民就一举击落击毁美机十二架。
    广治—承天地区军民二月份和三月份共击落击毁美机四十九架，创造了按月计算在广治—承天战场上击落美机架数的最高纪录。
    平定省军民在配合西原军民痛击美国第一骑兵师的英勇战斗中，仅在一月底到二月初期间在莱江地区和第德基地，就一共击落击毁美机近七十架。
    新华社河内十三日电　越南南方解放武装力量最近在西贡周围地区又打了几次漂亮的歼灭战，消灭了大量美伪军。
    据越南南方解放通讯社报道，三月三十一日夜间，嘉定省解放武装力量向古芝县福盛乡的伪军第三十七营营地发起猛攻，打得敌人一片混乱，在短短几个小时中就干净利落地歼灭敌人两个连，重创另一个连，共打死打伤敌人近三百名。
    在堤岸省，德和县的地方部队和游击队也非常活跃。他们从三月十七日到三十日粉碎了美伪军一次大“扫荡”。当参加“扫荡”的两千名美国侵略军和两个营、五个连的伪军进入解放区时，就立刻陷入了人民战争的天罗地网。英勇机智的地方部队和游击队密切配合作战，在十多天中共歼灭敌人六百名，其中包括美国侵略军四百五十名。
    边和省解放武装力量三月二十一日在步驾东北地区，截击前来“扫荡”的一连伪军，经过三十分钟的战斗，就全歼这个连的敌人。第二天，不甘心失败的敌人又向这个地区空投两连伪军。但敌人刚一落地，解放武装力量就把他们包围起来猛打，很快就全歼一个连，重创另一个连，残敌狼狈逃窜。
