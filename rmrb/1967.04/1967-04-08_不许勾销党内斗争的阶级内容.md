Like poisonous fungi fearing sunlight, all traitors to Marxism throughout history have always tried to avoid class struggle. They have always sought every possible means to excise the theory of class struggle from the whole of Marxism to suit the needs of the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie. This is their common trait. The top-ranking capitalist-roader in power within the Party in China today is no exception.

In the poisonous weed *Self-Cultivation*, there is a so-called "profound insight" about intra-Party struggle: "Because various Party members have different ways of looking at problems, their methods of handling problems also differ, leading to many disagreements and debates within the Party, leading to intra-Party struggles." Obviously, this reduces intra-Party struggle to merely the result of "various Party members having different ways of looking at problems."

Is that really the case?

Chairman Mao has always taught us: "Different ideas and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is the reflection of class contradictions and contradictions between new and old things within the Party. If there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve contradictions within the Party, the Party's life would stop." Here, Chairman Mao, based on the law of the unity of opposites in dialectical materialism, using Marxism-Leninism's theory of class struggle, has given the most profound exposition of intra-Party struggle within a proletarian party.

It is clear that the top-ranking capitalist-roader in power within the Party's "profound insight" is a blatant opposition to Mao Zedong Thought. He has completely erased the class content of intra-Party struggle and openly advocates for the proletariat and bourgeoisie to "merge into one," proletarian thought and bourgeois thought to "merge into one," Marxism-Leninism and opportunism to "merge into one," the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line to "merge into one."

According to his "profound insight," the "disagreements and debates over different opinions and proposals" within the Communist Party are not at all a reflection of class contradictions, not at all a manifestation of the contradictions between the two classes and two worldviews of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, but merely "different ways of looking at problems." Therefore, to resolve such disagreements and debates, one only needs to engage in "self-cultivation" and "improve" one's "way of looking at problems." As for emphasizing proletarian politics, carrying out active ideological struggle, eliminating private interests and establishing public interests, transforming worldviews, eliminating bourgeois thought, and promoting proletarian thought, all of these are seen as "unnecessary."

According to his "profound insight," all traitors and scabs throughout history who have betrayed the revolutionary interests of the proletariat, from foreign figures like Bernstein, Kautsky, and Khrushchev, to Chinese figures like Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao, should all be greatly "tolerated" and "forgiven," because their "mistakes" are merely that their "ways of looking at problems" are slightly "different" from ours; all revolutionary Marxists who have swept them into the dustbin of history with an iron broom are obviously suffering from the "madness" of "insisting on 'searching for' objects of struggle" as repeatedly emphasized in *Self-Cultivation*.

What kind of logic is this? This is the logic of a thorough traitor!

What kind of theory is this? This is a thorough and complete counter-revolutionary theory!

The severe reality of class struggle tells us: "The tree wants to be still, but the wind will not cease." The class enemy will never be content with their own destruction; they will never withdraw from the historical stage on their own. This is also the case within our Communist Party. Over the past seventeen years, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, with the support of the top-ranking capitalist-roader in power within the Party, have launched a comprehensive and rampant attack on the proletariat, spreading a large amount of poison in the political, economic, cultural, and educational domains. This top-ranking capitalist-roader within the Party has been peddling the black goods of the "merging into one" theory in the issue of intra-Party struggle, and its purpose is very clear: it is to disarm the broad masses of Party members and revolutionary people spiritually, thereby achieving the conspiracy to restore capitalism in our country.

All revolutionary comrades, can we allow such a sinister conspiracy to succeed? No, not in a thousand ways! Not in ten thousand ways! We must wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and smash the reactionary theory of the top-ranking capitalist-roader in power within the Party to smithereens. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and build our great socialist motherland into an iron fortress of the proletariat that will never change color from generation to generation!

    不许勾销党内斗争的阶级内容
    北京轻工业学院红鹰兵团惊雷战斗队　哨兵
    如同毒菌害怕阳光一样，历史上一切马克思主义的叛徒，总是极力回避阶级斗争，总是要想尽种种办法把阶级斗争理论从马克思主义的整体中阉割掉，以适应资产阶级反动统治的需要。这是他们的共同性。当今中国党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派也不例外。
    大毒草《修养》一书里，有一段关于共产党的党内斗争的“高论”：“因为各种党员看问题的方法不同，就使他们处理问题的方法也各不相同，就引起党内许多不同意见、不同主张的分歧和争论，就引起党内的斗争。”显然，这是把党内斗争仅仅归结为“各种党员看问题的方法不同”的结果。
    果真是这样吗？
    毛主席历来教导我们：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”在这里，毛主席根据唯物辩证法的对立统一规律，运用马克思列宁主义的阶级斗争理论，对无产阶级政党的党内斗争作了最深刻的阐述。
    很明显，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的“高论”，是明目张胆地对抗毛泽东思想的。他一笔勾销了党内斗争的阶级内容，公开鼓吹无产阶级与资产阶级“合二而一”，无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想“合二而一”，马列主义与机会主义“合二而一”，无产阶级革命路线与资产阶级反动路线“合二而一”。
    按照他的“高论”，共产党内“不同意见、不同主张的分歧和争论”根本不是阶级矛盾的反映，根本不是无产阶级与资产阶级两个阶级、两种世界观的矛盾的表现，而是“看问题的方法不同”。因此，解决这种分歧和争论，当然只要进行“自我修养”，“改进”一下“看问题的方法”就行了。至于突出无产阶级政治，开展积极的思想斗争，破“私”立“公”，改造世界观，灭资产阶级思想，兴无产阶级思想，在他看来一概是“多余”的。
    按照他的“高论”，对于历史上一切出卖无产阶级革命利益的叛徒、工贼们，从外国的伯恩斯坦、考茨基、赫鲁晓夫，到中国的陈独秀、张国焘，都是可以而且应该大大地“宽容”、“饶恕”一番的，因为他们的“过错”也不过是“看问题的方法”与我们稍有“不同”而已；一切革命的马克思主义者挥起铁扫帚将它们扫入历史垃圾箱，显然是犯了如《修养》中反复强调的“硬要去‘搜索’斗争对象”的“疯癫”病。
    这是什么逻辑？这是彻头彻尾的叛徒逻辑！
    这是什么理论？这是彻里彻外的反革命理论！
    严峻的阶级斗争现实告诉我们：“树欲静而风不止”，阶级敌人决不甘心于他们的灭亡，他们决不会自行退出历史舞台。反映到我们共产党内也是如此。十七年来，一小撮反革命修正主义分子在党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派支持下，向无产阶级发动了一个全面的猖狂进攻，在政治、经济、文化、教育各个领域里放了大量的毒。这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，在党内斗争问题上大肆贩卖“合二而一”论的黑货，其目的是十分明显的，那就是企图解除广大党员和革命人民的精神武装，从而实现在我国复辟资本主义的阴谋。
    一切革命的同志们，难道我们能容许这样的罪恶阴谋得逞吗？不，一千个不！一万个不！我们要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，将党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的反动理论打个稀巴烂。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把我们伟大的社会主义祖国建设成为无产阶级的铁打江山，世世代代永不变色！
