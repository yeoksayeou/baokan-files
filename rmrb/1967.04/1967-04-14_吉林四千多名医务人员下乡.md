Over 4,000 revolutionary medical personnel from Jilin Province recently formed mobile medical teams and headed to the front lines of spring agricultural production. They are actively engaged in disease prevention and treatment, serving the poor and lower-middle peasants, and contributing to agricultural production.

Before going to the countryside, the medical personnel studied the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's great directive of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." They vowed to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants "completely" and "thoroughly," just like Comrades Zhang Thide and Norman Bethune. (Xinhua News Agency)

    吉林四千多名医务人员下乡
    吉林省四千多名革命的医务人员最近组成巡回医疗队奔赴春耕生产第一线，积极开展防病治病工作，为贫下中农服务，为农业生产出力。
    医务人员们在下乡前，学习了“老三篇”以及毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。他们表示，一定要象张思德、白求恩同志那样，“完全”、“彻底”地为贫下中农服务。（据新华社讯）
