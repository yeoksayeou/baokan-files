The Soviet revisionist leadership has once again staged a farce of kneeling and surrendering to U.S. imperialism by allowing a South Korean team to "represent" Korea in the Prague basketball tournament and play against it.

	NEW DELHI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Soviet revisionist leadership has staged another farce of kneeling and surrendering to U.S. imperialism in the matter of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea participating in the so-called "Fifth World Women's Basketball Championship."

	This championship was held from April 14 to 23 in Czechoslovakia. The Basketball Association of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a "full member" of the International Amateur Basketball Federation. However, the International Amateur Basketball Federation, manipulated by U.S. imperialism, disregarded even its own "regulations" and refused to invite the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the preliminary rounds of the "Fifth World Women's Basketball Championship" held in 1965. The Basketball Association of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the relevant sports organizations of Czechoslovakia, the host country of this championship, had "requested" the secretary-general of the International Basketball Federation, the American Jones, to allow the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the competition, but this request was flatly rejected by Jones.

	On April 11, the Soviet revisionist leadership, in a hypocritical show of "support" for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, directed its basketball association to issue a statement "strongly protesting" Jones' "discrimination" against the Basketball Association of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and "depriving it of the right to participate in the championship." The statement "demanded once again" that Korea be allowed to participate. However, knowing the true nature of the Soviet revisionists, the American Jones paid no heed to this "strong protest."

	Two days later, the championship began, with eleven teams participating, including the basketball team of the South Korean puppet regime, which had been inserted into the championship by the United States. The Soviet revisionist group, which had just two days earlier issued a "strong protest," now threw its "statement" and "strong protest" to the winds, shamelessly and actively participated in the championship, and played against the basketball team sent by the Park Chung-hee puppet regime, which had usurped the name of "Korea." This once again exposed the true face of the Soviet revisionists as traitors who kneel and surrender to U.S. imperialism and reactionaries in various countries.

	The surrendering actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership have greatly emboldened the South Korean puppet regime, the sworn enemy of the Korean people. According to reports from Western news agencies, the coach of the South Korean team boasted to Western reporters that the decision by the International Basketball Federation to allow them to participate under the name of "Korea" made them "very proud of this development." It is reported that the person in charge of the South Korean team also proudly distributed a large number of reactionary pamphlets in Prague.

    苏修向美帝屈膝投降的又一幕丑剧
    竟让南朝鲜球队“代表”朝鲜参加布拉格篮球赛并同它举行比赛
    新华社二十五日讯  布拉格消息：苏修领导集团在关于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国参加所谓“第五届世界女子篮球锦标赛”的问题上，又演出了一幕向美帝国主义屈膝投降的丑剧。
    这届锦标赛是四月十四日到二十三日在捷克斯洛伐克举行的。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国篮球协会是国际业余篮球联合会的“正式会员”。但是为美帝国主义操纵的国际业余篮球联合会连这个组织的“规章”都不顾，拒绝邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国参加于一九六五年举行的“第五届世界女子篮球锦标赛”的预赛。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和主办这届锦标赛的捷克斯洛伐克的有关体育组织，曾就此“请求”国际篮联秘书长美国人琼斯让朝鲜民主主义人民共和国参加比赛，但是被琼斯断然否定。
    四月十一日，苏修领导集团假惺惺地为了表示对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的“支持”，曾指使其篮球协会出面发表声明，“强烈抗议”琼斯“歧视”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国篮球协会，“剥夺了它（朝鲜）参加锦标赛的权利”，声明“再次要求允许朝鲜参加”。但是深知苏修本性的美国人琼斯对这个“强烈抗议”根本不予理会。
    两天后，锦标赛开锣，十一个代表队参加了比赛，其中包括被美国塞进锦标赛的南朝鲜傀儡集团的篮球队。曾在两天前还提出“强烈抗议”的苏修集团，这时竟把它的“声明”和什么“强烈抗议”抛到九霄云外，厚颜无耻地积极参加了锦标赛，并且同窃取到“朝鲜”名义的朴正熙傀儡集团派出的篮球队进行了比赛。这又一次暴露了苏修向美帝国主义和各国反动派屈膝投降的叛徒真面目。
    苏修领导集团的投降行为大大助长了朝鲜人民的死敌——南朝鲜傀儡集团的反革命气焰。据西方通讯社报道，南朝鲜球队的教练向西方记者宣扬说，国际篮联决定他们以“朝鲜”名义参加，使他们“对这个事态的发展感到非常自豪”。据报道，南朝鲜球队负责人还得意洋洋在布拉格散发了大量的反动小册子。
