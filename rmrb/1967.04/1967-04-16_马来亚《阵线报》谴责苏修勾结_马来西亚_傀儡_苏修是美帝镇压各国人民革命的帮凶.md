	Newspaper “Frontline” published in Malaya has issued a commentary denouncing the Soviet revisionist clique for stepping up collusion with the American and British imperialists’ tool, the “Malaysia” puppet clique, and acting as the accomplice of U.S. imperialism in suppressing and sabotaging the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

	The commentary pointed out that at a time when the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the countries of Southeast Asia are becoming more and more vigorous, the U.S. imperialists convened the Guam invasion conference to prepare to “escalate” the war of aggression against Vietnam and further suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the countries of Southeast Asia, the Soviet revisionist clique is busy conducting activities in this region, establishing relations with the imperialists’ lackeys and puppets, and engaging in so-called “cooperation.” This is obviously for some sinister purpose.

	The commentary said that the Soviet revisionist clique, turning a blind eye to the bloody facts of the imperialists and the “Malaysia” puppet clique ruthlessly exploiting and oppressing the people of Malaya, recently sent a “trade delegation” headed by Spandaryan to “Malaysia” to congratulate “Malaysia” on its “prosperity and progress,” and to provide “economic and technical aid for development.” The representative of the “Malaysia” puppet clique said at the signing ceremony of the “Malaysia”-Soviet trade agreement that “our (Malaysia and the Soviet Union) basic goals are the same.” The commentary pointed out, what is their “basic goal”? It is to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the people of Malaya and maintain the status quo of the exploiters riding on the heads of the people and oppressing and enslaving them!

	The commentary pointed out that at present, the international revolutionary situation is excellent. The revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world are powerfully striking at U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and achieving victory after victory. We must pay close attention to the conspiracy of the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists to dominate the world, pay close attention to the various treacherous and sabotage activities of the Soviet revisionists against the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, and expose them in a timely manner.

    马来亚《阵线报》谴责苏修勾结“马来西亚”傀儡
    苏修是美帝镇压各国人民革命的帮凶
    新华社十五日讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》九日发表评论，强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团加紧勾结美英帝国主义的工具
  “马来西亚”傀儡集团，充当美帝国主义镇压和破坏各国人民革命斗争的帮凶。
    评论指出，正当东南亚各国人民的革命斗争日益蓬勃发展，美帝召开了关岛侵略会议，准备把侵越战争“升级”，并进一步镇压东南亚各国人民的革命斗争的时刻，苏修集团到这个地区大肆进行活动，和帝国主义的仆从和傀儡拉关系，进行所谓“合作”，显然是有着不可告人的目的。
    评论说，苏修集团无视帝国主义和“马来西亚”傀儡集团残酷剥削、压迫马来亚人民的血淋淋事实，它最近派去“马来西亚”活动的“贸易代表团”团长斯潘达里扬却祝贺“马来西亚”“繁荣进步”，还要给“马来西亚”提供“发展经济技术援助”。“马来西亚”傀儡集团的代表在“马来西亚”、苏修贸易协定的签字仪式上也大谈“我们（马、苏）基本目标是一致的。”评论指出，什么是他们的“基本目标”呢？就是要扑灭马来亚人民的革命怒火，维持剥削统治者骑在人民头上压榨奴役人民的现状！
    评论指出，当前，国际革命形势一片大好，亚、非、拉，以及世界各国人民的革命斗争，正在有力地打击着美帝国主义及其走狗，并取得节节胜利。我们必须密切注意苏修和美帝合伙主宰世界的阴谋，密切注意苏修所进行的各种出卖和破坏各国人民革命斗争的卑鄙勾当，并及时地给予彻底揭露。
