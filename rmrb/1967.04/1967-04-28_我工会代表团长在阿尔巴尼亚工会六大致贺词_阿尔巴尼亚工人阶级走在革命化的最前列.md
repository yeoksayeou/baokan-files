The head of the Chinese trade union delegation, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Zhao Guoqian, delivered a congratulatory speech on April 24 to the Sixth Congress of the Albanian Trade Unions.

The speech highly praised the achievements of the Albanian people under the wise leadership of the glorious Albanian Party of Labour led by Comrade Enver Hoxha in the cause of socialist construction. The speech said that at present, a new and deeper high tide of the revolutionization movement has emerged in Albania. The broad masses of the people are actively participating in the struggle against bureaucracy, against religious superstition, against bourgeois ideology, against feudal patriarchy, and resolutely breaking away from the backward habits of despising and humiliating women.

The speech said that these measures of revolutionization have great theoretical and practical significance. They will enrich the experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat and have a far-reaching international impact.

The heroic Albanian working class is at the forefront of the Albanian people's march towards further revolutionization.

The speech pointed out that the Albanian trade unions, loyal to the people and to proletarian internationalism, have adhered to the proletarian revolutionary line of opposing imperialism and class struggle in the world trade union movement. They have waged an irreconcilable struggle against the Soviet trade union leaders who advocate revisionism and their followers, as well as against the Tito clique. The Albanian trade unions are indeed an organization of the working class nurtured by a long-tested revolutionary Marxist-Leninist party.

The speech said that we are deeply convinced that this congress of yours will powerfully mobilize the Albanian working masses to achieve new successes in fulfilling the political tasks and the Fourth Five-Year Plan proposed by the historically significant Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, and to further deepen the cultural revolution. This congress will also make greater contributions to the struggle of the workers and peoples of all countries against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

The speech said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao in our country, has brought our socialist revolution to a new stage. This revolution has opened a new era in the history of the international communist movement.

The speech said that now, the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has been established. The revolutionary storm of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat uniting to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, which began in Shanghai in January, is sweeping across the country. Recently, the signal for a thorough criticism of the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the party has been sounded. The working class and the people of our country are full of fighting spirit and high morale, determined to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which concerns the destiny and future of our country and the world people's revolution, to the end, and will not rest until complete victory is achieved.

The speech said that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working people of our country have taken Mao Zedong Thought as the weapon for criticism and struggle, and as the guide to action. They have pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high tide, thus bringing about a new era in our country where workers, peasants, and soldiers master Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This is an epoch-making event in the history of Marxism. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, and a powerful ideological weapon against revisionism and dogmatism. Arm the whole people with Mao Zedong Thought, which is the most reliable and fundamental guarantee to make socialist China an ironclad fortress of the proletariat that will never change color. At the same time, we are glad to see that more and more revolutionary people around the world love Mao Zedong Thought, are studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and are taking Mao Zedong Thought as the compass to guide their revolutionary struggle to victory.

The speech concluded by saying that the workers and peoples of China and Albania have established a deep friendship in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. This friendship is deeper than the Adriatic Sea and higher than the Himalayas, and is unbreakable. Chairman Mao said: "We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades. We are not those hypocritical friends who are two-faced. Our revolutionary and fighting friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests."

When Zhao Guoqian delivered the speech, the entire delegation stood up several times and enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Enver-Hoxha," "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" After the speech was read, Zhao Guoqian, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, presented a banner to the Central Council of the Albanian Trade Unions. The banner read: "The revolutionary unity and fighting friendship between the workers and peoples of China and Albania will last forever!" Amidst thunderous cheers and applause, Comrade Hoxha and Zhao Guoqian warmly embraced each other, fully demonstrating the great friendship and fighting unity between the peoples of China and Albania.

    我工会代表团长在阿尔巴尼亚工会六大致贺词
    阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级走在革命化的最前列
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　中国工会代表团团长、中华全国总工会书记处书记赵国强二十四日向阿尔巴尼亚工会第六次代表大会致贺词。
    贺词高度赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，在社会主义建设事业中取得的辉煌成就。贺词说，目前阿尔巴尼亚的革命化运动出现了一个更加深入的新高潮。广大人民群众积极参加反对官僚主义、反对宗教迷信、反对资产阶级思想、反对封建的家长制、坚决破除轻视和侮辱妇女的落后习惯的斗争。
    贺词说，这些革命化措施，具有重大的理论意义和实践意义，它将丰富无产阶级专政的经验，发生深远的国际影响。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级在阿尔巴尼亚人民实现进一步革命化的进军中，走在这个光荣队伍的最前列。
    贺词指出，阿尔巴尼亚工会，忠于人民，忠于无产阶级国际主义，在世界工会运动中坚持反对帝国主义和阶级斗争的无产阶级革命路线，同奉行修正主义的苏联工会领导人及其追随者、同铁托集团进行了不调和的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚工会不愧为是一个由久经考验的革命的马克思列宁主义政党所哺育的工人阶级群众组织。
    贺词说，我们深信，你们这次大会，将有力地动员阿尔巴尼亚工人群众，为实现具有历史意义的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会所提出的政治任务和第四个五年计划，为进一步深入开展思想文化革命，而创造出新的成就；你们这次大会，也必将对世界各国工人和人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争作出更大的贡献。
    贺词说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，使我国的社会主义革命发展到一个新阶段。这个革命，在国际共产主义运动的历史上开辟了一个新纪元。
    贺词说，现在，我国无产阶级文化大革命伟大胜利的局面已经奠定。今年一月从上海开始的，无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的革命风暴，正在席卷全国。最近，又吹响了彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的进军号。我国工人阶级和全国人民斗志昂扬，意气风发，一定要把这场关系到我国国家的命运和前途、关系到世界人民革命的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，誓不罢休。
    贺词说，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我国劳动人民把毛泽东思想作为批判和战斗的武器，作为行动的指南，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的高潮，从而正在我国出现一个工农兵掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的新时代。这是马克思主义发展史上的一件划时代的大事。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。用毛泽东思想武装全国人民，是使社会主义中国成为无产阶级的铁打江山，永不变色的最可靠最根本的保证。同时，我们高兴地看到，全世界越来越多的革命人民热爱毛泽东思想，正在学习和运用毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想作为引导他们的革命斗争走向胜利的方向盘。
    贺词最后说，中阿两国工人、两国人民在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中建立了深厚的战斗友谊。这种友谊比亚得里亚海还深，比喜马拉雅山还高，是牢不可破的。毛主席说：“我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”
    赵国强同志在宣读贺词的时候，全体代表多次起立热烈高呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁”等口号。宣读贺词结束后，赵国强同志代表中华全国总工会赠给阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会一面锦旗。上面写着：“中阿两国工人、两国人民的革命团结和战斗友谊万古长青！”在暴风雨般的欢呼声和掌声中，霍查同志和赵国强同志热烈拥抱，充分表现了中阿两国人民的伟大友谊和战斗团结。
