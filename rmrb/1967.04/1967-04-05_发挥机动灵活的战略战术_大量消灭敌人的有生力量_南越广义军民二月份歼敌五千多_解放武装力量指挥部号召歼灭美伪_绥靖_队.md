The liberation armed forces of Quang Ngai Province in South Vietnam fought bravely in February, achieving a great victory by annihilating 5,500 enemy troops. Among the annihilated enemy forces were 1,612 American invaders and 1,133 South Korean mercenaries.

During the month, the liberation armed forces of Quang Ngai Province destroyed and severely damaged six enemy battalions (including two South Korean mercenary battalions) and twelve companies (including five American companies). They also destroyed and disintegrated one enemy paratrooper regiment and severely damaged one enemy ranger regiment.

In addition, the liberation armed forces during this period shot down and damaged 38 enemy aircraft, destroyed 20 enemy vehicles, 19 cannons, captured and forced the enemy to withdraw from 13 strongholds, and assisted the people in demolishing a large number of "strategic hamlets." The combat effectiveness of the guerrilla forces has significantly improved. They have adopted many very flexible tactics, capable of consuming a large number of enemy forces under any difficult conditions, annihilating the enemy in whole squads and companies.

According to the South Vietnam Liberation Radio, the liberation armed forces of Binh Dinh Province in South Vietnam launched consecutive attacks on the enemy in the last two days of March, annihilating 528 American invaders.

On March 28, the liberation armed forces of Binh Dinh Province attacked the American military base in the Ky Nghia area north of Loc Ninh, annihilating 200 American invaders and destroying 17 vehicles.

On March 28 and 29, the liberation armed forces of Binh Dinh Province also conducted multiple battles in the Soc Trang area and on Highway 13, annihilating 328 American invaders, destroying 20 tanks and armored vehicles, shooting down two helicopters, and destroying two cannons.

According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Command recently issued an order calling on the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces to annihilate the so-called "pacification" teams of the U.S.-puppet clique while annihilating American and puppet troops.

The order states that the U.S.-puppet clique is implementing a large-scale "pincer offensive" plan. One of the key points of this plan is to use most of the puppet troops and some American and mercenary troops to carry out "pacification" tasks, that is, to massacre the people of South Vietnam, destroy houses and crops, and force residents into concentration camps. The American bandits also train a group of running dogs, known as "pacification personnel," to follow the U.S.-puppet troops to deceive and control the residents.

The order states that therefore, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Command calls on all soldiers of the militia, guerrilla forces, local forces, and main forces to vigorously promote the movement of "finding and fighting the Americans, finding and annihilating the puppets" while paying attention to annihilating the "pacification" teams of the U.S.-puppet clique, paying attention to annihilating the commanders and thugs within the "pacification" teams, and working to turn those who were forced or deceived into joining the "pacification" teams to the side of the people.

    发挥机动灵活的战略战术　大量消灭敌人的有生力量
    南越广义军民二月份歼敌五千多
    解放武装力量指挥部号召歼灭美伪“绥靖”队
    据新华社河内四日电　据越南南方解放电台广播：越南南方广义省解放武装力量二月份英勇战斗，取得了歼敌五千五百名的巨大胜利。在被歼的敌人中包括有美国侵略军一千六百一十二名，南朝鲜帮凶军一千一百三十三名。
    广义省解放武装力量在这个月中共消灭和重创敌人六个营（其中有南朝鲜帮凶军两个营）、十二个排（其中有美军五个排），消灭和瓦解伪军伞兵一个战团，重创伪军别动队一个战团。
    此外，解放武装力量在这期间还击落、击伤敌机三十八架，击毁敌人军车二十辆、大炮十九门，攻克和迫使敌人撤出十三个据点，协助人民捣毁了大批“战略村”。游击队的作战水平有了很大的提高，他们采用了许多非常灵活的战术，在任何困难条件下，都可以大量地消耗敌人的有生力量，整班、整排地歼灭敌人。
    据新华社河内四日电　据越南南方解放电台广播：越南南方边和省解放武装力量在三月底的两天中，接连进攻敌人，共消灭美国侵略军五百二十八名。
    三月二十八日，边和省解放武装力量袭击了禄宁以北的纪业地区的美军驻地，一举消灭美国侵略军二百名，击毁军车十七辆。
    三月二十八日和二十九日两天，边和省解放武装力量还在朔昆曾地区和第十三号公路上进行了多次战斗，共消灭美国侵略军三百二十八名，击毁坦克和装甲车二十辆，击落直升飞机两架，击毁大炮两门。
    新华社河内四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方解放武装力量指挥部最近颁布一项命令，号召越南南方解放武装力量在消灭美伪军的同时，注意消灭美伪集团的所谓“绥靖”队。
    命令说，美伪集团正在推行大规模的“钳形攻势计划”。这项计划的要点之一是，使用大部分伪军和一部分美军及其帮凶军去执行“绥靖”任务，即屠杀越南南方人民，破坏房屋、庄稼，并强迫居民到集中营去。美国强盗还培养一批走狗——所谓“绥靖人员”，编成队尾随美伪军去欺骗和控制居民。
    命令说，因此，南方解放武装力量指挥部号召民兵、游击队、地方部队、主力部队的全体战士，在大力促进“找美国佬打，找伪军歼”的运动的同时，必须注意消灭美伪集团的“绥靖”队，注意消灭“绥靖”队里的指挥官和恶棍，设法向被迫或受骗参加“绥靖”队的人进行工作，使他们投向人民方面。
