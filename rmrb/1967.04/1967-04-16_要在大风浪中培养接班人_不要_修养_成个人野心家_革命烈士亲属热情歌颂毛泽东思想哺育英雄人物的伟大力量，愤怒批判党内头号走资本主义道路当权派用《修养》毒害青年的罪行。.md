Relatives of Revolutionary Martyrs Warmly Praise the Great Power of Mao Zedong Thought in Nurturing Heroes, Angrily Criticize the Crimes of the Top Party Power-Holder Who Walks the Capitalist Road in Poisoning the Youth with "Cultivation"

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 15th, the father of the Communist warrior Yang Yanghai, Yang Hengwen, the mother of Mao Zedong's good soldier Liu Yingjun, Zhu Xiulan, and the son of the martyrs Peng Yongwu and Jiang Zhen, Peng Yun, in denouncing the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of the top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road, pointed out that under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and in the storms of class struggle, successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution are constantly growing and strengthening. Countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the revolution and the people. For a long time, the top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road has used his "Cultivation" to poison and corrupt revolutionary cadres and youth, peddling the philosophy of survival and betrayal. Relatives of revolutionary martyrs expressed that they will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use the powerful and sharp ideological weapon of the "Three Articles" to thoroughly criticize, expose, and denounce "Cultivation," absolutely not allowing it to poison revolutionary cadres and youth, and cultivate agents of the bourgeoisie. They will use the five conditions proposed by Chairman Mao to foster successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

	Use "Cultivation" to Poison the Youth, This Will Not Do!

	Father of the Communist Warrior Yang Yanghai, Yang Hengwen

	Our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution are produced in the midst of the masses' struggles, tempered in the great winds and storms of the revolution." We must always remember Chairman Mao's earnest teachings.

	Successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution can only be discovered, fostered, and tempered in the midst of the masses' struggles. They must face the wind and rain, see the world, and participate in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment with the workers and peasants. They must understand class and class struggle. Yang Yanghai was nurtured and grew up in the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought amidst the great winds and storms. From a young age, he followed me in labor and suffered with me. After liberation, he deeply understood that it was Chairman Mao who saved us; he deeply understood that landlords and capitalists were fattened by the blood and sweat of the poor. Therefore, he loved our great leader Chairman Mao the most, loved reading Chairman Mao's books the most, and listened to Chairman Mao's words the most. From a young age, he had a single-minded desire to join the army and use a rifle to kill the enemy. After joining the army, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and in the storms of class struggle, he quickly grew into a soldier of the people with high consciousness, great public spirit, and communist ideals. When the revolution needed him to sacrifice himself, he did not change color or falter.

	However, for a long time, the top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road has used his "Cultivation" to poison and corrupt the revolutionary people. This poisonous weed advocates "examining oneself three times a day," "seriously engaging in self-cultivation," and so on. This is all deceitful talk. He wants people to follow the secret formula of bourgeois individualism, tying their hands and feet, not going through the storms and tempests to temper themselves, not learning from the masses, but closing the door to "cultivate" themselves. The result of such "cultivation" will inevitably be the more one "cultivates," the more one becomes detached from the masses, detached from the revolution, and detached from reality, becoming an official.

	Why does the top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road repeatedly throw out his counter-revolutionary revisionist "Cultivation," strenuously opposing Chairman Mao's teachings on fostering successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution? In a word, it is to attempt to use the poisoned arrow of "Cultivation" to poison the revolutionary masses, foster bourgeois successors, and prepare for counter-revolutionary restoration. This will not do, not in a thousand ways, not in ten thousand ways! The revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. They have finally used Mao Zedong Thought, this most sharp weapon, to expose the tricks of this Khrushchev-style schemer and conspirator.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters must be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely." Now, the heinous crimes of the top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road have been exposed, and the advance signal for a general offensive against the Chinese Khrushchev has been sounded. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

	We must definitely hold high the revolutionary banner of criticism of the proletariat, use the pen as a sword and spear, and use Mao Zedong Thought, this most powerful combat weapon, to thoroughly expose and criticize the poisonous weed "Cultivation," eliminate its poison in all aspects, resolutely overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev, overthrow the main backer of revisionism in our country, and not stop until we achieve complete victory.

	"The Three Articles" Are the Sunshine and Rain for Fostering Successors to the Cause of the Proletarian Revolution

	Mother of Mao Zedong's Good Soldier Liu Yingjun, Zhu Xiulan

	Now, the revolutionary people of the entire country are rising up with the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, holding high the revolutionary banner of criticism of the proletariat, and fiercely opening fire on the top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road. I must definitely, like Mao Zedong's good soldier Liu Yingjun, with boundless hatred for the class enemy, overthrow and denounce the top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road.

	The poisonous weed "Cultivation" meticulously cultivated by the top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road, I had not seen it before. This time, comrades read it to me, and I was so angry that my lungs almost burst. I could not bear to listen. Isn't this to make us revolutionary people run towards the capitalist road? In his peddling of the resourceful business of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," false public-private dealings, he is advocating the philosophy of life of feudalism. This book is a thorough poisonous weed!

	Our great leader Chairman Mao wrote the brilliant "Three Articles" more than twenty years ago, teaching us to "completely, thoroughly serve the people," to be a person of high moral character, purity, and benefit to the people, detached from vulgar interests. He pointed out a revolutionary path for us. Liu Huilan, Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Yang Yanghai, Liu Yingjun... from an ordinary youth to a warrior of the proletarian revolution, they all grew up on this revolutionary path under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Yingjun, from a young age, had deep class feelings for our greatest leader Chairman Mao, using Chairman Mao's great teachings to inspire and transform himself, making himself progress every day. After joining the army, he was tempered in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought in the People's Liberation Army. With boundless love for Chairman Mao, he told me: "Chairman Mao's works are like the sun, every word and sentence shines with golden light, illuminating the hearts of soldiers, giving direction to work and study." He regarded reading Chairman Mao's books as the first need of life, regarding the "Three Articles" as his motto. He told me that it was the "Three Articles" that taught him how a revolutionary should fight meaningfully. Yingjun could wholeheartedly serve the people and sacrifice his life for the cause of communism, all thanks to the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. The boundless Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon for fostering successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution, the source of power for creating communist heroes.

	However, the top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road used "Cultivation" to oppose Mao Zedong Thought. He shouted loudly, advocating the bourgeois individual name and benefit ideology, advocating personal fame and fortune, peddling the bourgeois philosophy of life of "if one does not seek personal gain, one will be punished by heaven and earth." He said: "Temper oneself," "strive to improve one's thoughts and abilities," "seek one's own progress," "gain the trust and support of Party members and the masses, and become leaders and heroes in the cause of communism." All his words, turned over and over, sentence by sentence, do not leave "oneself," sentence by sentence, do not leave becoming a "leader," a "hero." Isn't this clearly using bourgeois individualism to corrupt and poison the people, aiming to achieve his goal of restoring capitalism, pushing people into the fire pit? If one falls for the poison of this Chinese Khrushchev, thinking only of personal fame and fortune every day, thinking only of how to climb up, can one wholeheartedly do revolutionary work and be a servant of the people? If one falls for the poison spread by "Cultivation," can one stand up to fight against words and deeds that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought? If one believes in the traitor philosophy of this Chinese Khrushchev, in a critical moment of life and death, can one bravely sacrifice one's life for the cause of communism for humanity? No! Absolutely not! Bourgeois ideology and proletarian ideology are fundamentally opposed. Just as our farmers often say: what kind of vine grows, what kind of fruit it bears; what kind of seed is sown, what kind of sprout it grows. Following the set of "Cultivation," one can only "cultivate" Khrushchev-style personal ambitionists, bourgeois slaves full of vulgar interests, traitors who fear death and love life!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution are produced in the midst of the masses' struggles, tempered in the great winds and storms of the revolution." Yingjun followed Chairman Mao's teachings, throwing himself into the fiery class struggle and production struggle, not closing the door to read books, but actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle. In the storms of revolutionary struggle and in practice close to the workers and peasants, he used the "Three Articles" to diligently transform his thoughts, understanding class exploitation, understanding class struggle, forging a red heart that is forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, in "Cultivation," advocates that people "cultivate themselves" in the house, detached from class struggle, not revolutionary, not proletarian dictatorship. He also vigorously advocates that Communist Party members learn the "sage's way" from Confucius, Mencius, and Zengzi, who ruled our poor and lower-middle peasants for thousands of years. What is he doing? He wants us to be good slaves, gradually turning into successors of capitalism.

	The wolfish ambition of the top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road is so poisonous! He is the enemy of the Chinese people and the enemy of the world's people. If his plot succeeds, China will change color, capitalism will be restored, and the landlords and capitalists will ride on our backs again, whipping us with whips, making us suffer twice. We poor and lower-middle peasants will not agree! Chairman Mao teaches us: "There are errors, so they must be criticized; there are poisonous weeds, so they must be fought." We will hold high the revolutionary banner of criticism of the proletariat, use the red "Three Articles" as a weapon, criticize and denounce "Cultivation," throw this mixture of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism into the garbage dump! Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high over all positions, forever flying high, let our proletarian state never change color!

	Expose the Traitor Philosophy

	Son of the Martyrs Peng Yongwu and Jiang Zhen, Peng Yun, of the Harbin Military Engineering Academy

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "To struggle means to make sacrifices, and the death of people is a common occurrence. But we think of the interests of the people, of the suffering of the majority of the people. To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai; to die for the reactionaries, to die for the exploiters and oppressors of the people, is lighter than a feather." In the great revolutionary history of China, countless revolutionary martyrs, for the interests of the people, for the defense of the truth of communism, have sacrificed their lives, writing moving chapters of heroism.

	However, the top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road has advocated and peddled his philosophy of survival, philosophy of surrender, traitor philosophy in the revolutionary ranks, openly opposing Mao Zedong Thought. It is this Chinese Khrushchev who, on the eve of the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, instructed others to surrender and betray, making them surrender to the Kuomintang, betray the Communist Party, and publicly issue an "anti-communist statement," swearing to "resolutely oppose communism." How despicable, how hateful! This self-proclaimed "old revolutionary" has his mask torn off, revealing himself to be a thorough fake revolutionary, counter-revolutionary.

	This top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road not only instructed others to surrender and betray but also, in the poisonous weed "Cultivation," created a "theoretical" basis for traitors, saying things like "in the environment of reactionary rule, in necessary times, one must abandon some of the Party's work to preserve comrades," and so on. In a word, it is to say that under the white terror of the Kuomintang, to save one's life, one can betray the interests and principles of the Party, just like he himself, on the eve of the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, instructed his followers to crawl out of the enemy's prison after issuing the "anti-communist statement." The Soviet Khrushchev advocated that "when a person dies, what use is there for principles," and the Chinese Khrushchev advocated "in necessary times, one must abandon some of the Party's work to preserve comrades," "cherish oneself, protect one's life and health." Their faces are so similar, their tones so consistent. This is a thorough reactionary bourgeois philosophy of survival, all traitor philosophy of revisionism. For decades, this Chinese Khrushchev has engaged in the business of surrender and betrayal, forming cliques and factions, which is the best footnote to this traitor philosophy.

	I am the son of a martyr. My father Peng Yongwu, my mother Jiang Zhen (Jiang Qing), and countless martyrs, for the victory of the revolution, for the defense of the great Mao Zedong Thought, bravely sacrificed their lives. The enemy cut off my father's head and several other comrades' heads and hung them on the city wall, trying to extinguish the revolutionary flames, but the people did not surrender, and the revolutionary flames burned even more fiercely. My mother, in the hell of Zhaqiao and Baiguogong, had bamboo sticks nailed into her fingers by the enemy, but she did not utter a single moan until her last moment before execution, her face unchanged, her heart unshaken. Countless revolutionary martyrs were like this, choosing to die standing rather than live kneeling, using their lives to defend Mao Zedong Thought, maintaining the glorious spirit of Communist Party members. "To die for the interests of the people is weightier than Mount Tai; to die for the fascists, to die for the exploiters and oppressors of the people, is lighter than a feather." This is our proletarian view of life and death. In the face of the heroic deeds of countless revolutionary martyrs, the traitor philosophy advocated by the top Party power-holder who walks the capitalist road is so despicable, so filthy.

	Under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, countless heroes have grown up. They have bravely sacrificed themselves, watering the revolutionary flowers with their blood, exchanging their lives for the liberation of the motherland. However, the Chinese Khrushchev has always practiced capitulationism, proposing a "peaceful democratic new stage," and bowing his head to become a lackey of imperialism, attempting to hand over the state won by the revolutionary forebears with their blood to imperialism and the comprador bourgeoisie of China. He is indeed a typical nationalist and class capitulationist. According to his logic, China should return to the old China, and the people should become oxen and horses, forever exploited. However, the wheel of history is forever moving forward, and in the end, it is a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists and their main backer—the Chinese Khrushchev—who are crushed by the wheel of history.

	In the great proletarian cultural revolution, we Red Guards, following the teachings of our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, "dare to draw the emperor down from his horse," have experienced countless blows and sieges, and finally "killed" our way out. In this unprecedented great revolution, the great Mao Zedong Thought has given us boundless confidence and courage. Now, the struggle has entered a new decisive battle stage. We will rise up with the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, criticize and denounce the traitor philosophy of the Chinese Khrushchev, pull him down from his horse, make him stand aside, and let the boundless Mao Zedong Thought forever illuminate all of China, illuminate the whole world!

    要在大风浪中培养接班人　不要“修养”成个人野心家
    革命烈士亲属热情歌颂毛泽东思想哺育英雄人物的伟大力量，愤怒批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派用《修养》毒害青年的罪行。
    据新华社十五日讯　共产主义战士欧阳海的父亲欧阳恒文，毛主席的好战士刘英俊的母亲朱秀兰，烈士彭咏梧、江竹筠的儿子彭云，在愤怒声讨党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行时指出，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在阶级斗争的风浪里，无产阶级革命事业接班人不断成长壮大，无数革命烈士，抛头颅、洒热血，为革命、为人民英勇牺牲；长期以来，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却用他的《修养》毒害和腐蚀革命干部和青年，贩卖活命论、叛徒哲学。革命烈士亲属表示，要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，用“老三篇”这一强大锐利的思想武器，把《修养》批深批透批臭，绝不允许用《修养》来毒害革命干部和青年，培养资产阶级的代理人，要用毛主席提出的五项条件，培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    用《修养》来毒害青年，这办不到！
    共产主义战士欧阳海的父亲　欧阳恒文
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”我们要永远记住毛主席的谆谆教导。
    无产阶级革命事业的接班人，只能在群众斗争中去发现、培养、锻炼。要经风雨，见世面，和工农群众一起参加阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动，要懂得阶级和阶级斗争。欧阳海就是在大风大浪里，用伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想哺育成长起来的。他从小就跟着我参加劳动、跟着我受苦。解放后，他深深懂得，是毛主席把我们救了出来；深深懂得，地主、资本家是剥削穷人的血和汗养肥起来的。所以，他最热爱我们伟大领袖毛主席，最爱读毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话。他从小就一个心眼地要当解放军，拿枪杆杀敌人。参军以后，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在阶级斗争的风浪里，他很快成长为一个具有共产主义理想的，高度觉悟的，大公无私的人民战士，当革命需要他献身时，脸不变色心不跳。
    但是，长期以来，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却用他的《修养》来毒害和腐蚀革命人民。这株大毒草，提倡什么“吾日三省吾身”，“郑重其事地去进行自我修养”等。这完全是欺人之谈，他要人们按照资产阶级个人主义的秘方，捆住手脚，不到大风大浪里去锻炼，不向群众学习，关起门来“修养”。这样“修养”的结果，必然是越“养”越“修”，越“养”越成为脱离群众，脱离革命，脱离实际的官老爷。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，为什么一而再，再而三地把他的反革命修正主义的《修养》抛出来，竭力对抗毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的教导呢？说穿了，就是妄图用《修养》这支毒箭，毒害革命群众，培养资产阶级的接班人，为反革命复辟作准备。这是办不到的，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民心最红，眼最亮，终于用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，戳穿了这个赫鲁晓夫式的野心家、阴谋家的诡计。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”现在，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，已经揭露出来了，向中国的赫鲁晓夫发起总攻击的进军号已经吹响了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    我们一定要高高举起无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜，以笔作刀枪，运用毛泽东思想这个最强大的战斗武器，彻底揭露和批判《修养》这株大毒草，肃清它在各方面的流毒，坚决打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫，推翻我国修正主义的总后台，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    “老三篇”是培养无产阶级革命事业
    接班人的阳光雨露毛主席的好战士刘英俊的母亲　朱秀兰
    现在全国革命人民正在奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜，向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。我一定要象毛主席的好战士刘英俊那样，怀着对阶级敌人的无比仇恨，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派打倒、斗臭。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所精心培植的大毒草《修养》，我以前没有看过。这次同志们念给我听了，我听得肺都气炸了，我听不下去，这不是要叫我们革命人民朝资本主义道路上跑吗？在他贩卖“吃小亏，占大便宜”、假公营私的资产阶级个人主义“买卖经”，他在鼓吹封建主义的处世哲学，这本书是彻头彻尾的大毒草！
    毛主席他老人家早在二十多年前，就写出了金光灿烂的“老三篇”，教导我们要“毫不利己专门利人”，“完全”、“彻底”“为人民服务”，做一个高尚的人，纯粹的人，有道德的人，脱离了低级趣味的人，有益于人民的人。为我们指明了一条革命化大道。刘胡兰、董存瑞、黄继光、雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、刘英俊……，从一个普通的青年成为无产阶级革命战士，都是沿着这条革命道路，在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的。
    英俊从小就对我们最伟大的领袖毛主席充满了深厚的阶级感情，用毛主席的伟大教导激励自己，改造自己，使自己天天向上。参军后，他在解放军这个毛泽东思想大学校里，经受了锻炼。他怀着对毛主席无比热爱的感情跟我说：“毛主席著作象太阳，字字句句闪金光，照得战士心里亮，工作学习有方向。”他把读毛主席的书，当成了生活的第一需要，把“老三篇”当成座右铭。他告诉我，是“老三篇”教他懂得了一个革命者怎样战斗才有意义。英俊能全心全意为人民，能为共产主义事业献出自己的生命，全是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的最强大的思想武器，是造就共产主义英雄的力量源泉。
    可是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却用《修养》来反对毛泽东思想。他破着嗓门宣扬资产阶级个人名利思想，鼓吹个人成名成家，贩卖的全是“人不为己，天诛地灭”的资产阶级人生观。他说：“锻炼自己”“加紧自己的修养，提高自己的思想能力”，“求得自己的进步”、“取得党员和群众的信仰和拥护，而成为共产主义事业中的领袖和英雄。”他说的这一大套，翻过来，倒过去，句句不离“自己”，句句不离当“领袖”，当“英雄”，这不明明是用资产阶级个人主义腐蚀、毒害人民群众，好达到他复辟资本主义的目的，把人往火坑里推吗？如果中了这个中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，整天脑子里想的全是个人名利，全是如何如何往上爬，那还能一心一意干革命，当人民的勤务员吗？如果中了《修养》所散布的那一套毒素的计，那还能对不符合毛泽东思想的言行，起来进行针锋相对的斗争，起来勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想吗？如果相信了这个中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒哲学，在生死的紧急关头，能为人类的共产主义事业英勇地献出自己的生命吗？不能！决不能！资产阶级思想和无产阶级思想是根本对立的。就象咱庄稼人常说的：长什么藤蔓结什么瓜，播什么种子发什么芽。按着党内头号走资本主义道路当权派说的那一套去“修养”，只能“修养”出赫鲁晓夫式的个人野心家，充满低级趣味的资产阶级奴才，贪生怕死的叛徒！
    毛主席教导我们说：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”英俊就是按着毛主席的教导，投身到火热的阶级斗争、生产斗争中去，不是闭门读书，而是在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，锻炼和改造自己。他在革命斗争的风浪中，在接近工农群众的实践中，用“老三篇”，刻苦地改造思想，懂得了阶级剥削，懂得了阶级斗争，炼就了一颗永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的红心。但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫，在《修养》中提倡人们关在屋子里“修身养性”，脱离阶级斗争，不要革命，不要无产阶级专政。他还大肆鼓吹让共产党员向统治咱贫下中农几千年的大地主孔子、孟子、曾子学习“圣贤之道”。他这样做为了啥？就是让咱们老老实实当奴隶，慢慢演变成资本主义的接班人。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的狼子野心，多毒辣呀！他是中国人民的死敌，也是世界人民的死敌。要是让他的阴谋得逞，中国就得变颜色，资本主义就会复辟，地主资本家又会骑在我们身上用鞭子抽我们，使我们重受二遍苦。我们贫下中农决不答应！毛主席教导我们：“有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。”我们要高举无产阶级革命的批判旗帜，用红彤彤的“老三篇”做武器，把《修养》批倒批臭，把这个封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的大杂烩，扔到垃圾堆里去！让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地，永远高高飘扬，让咱无产阶级江山永不变色！
    把叛徒哲学拿出来示众
    烈士彭咏梧和江竹筠的儿子、哈尔滨军事工程学院  彭云
    毛主席教导我们：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”在中国的伟大革命史上，无数的革命先烈，为了人民的利益，为了保卫共产主义的真理，抛头颅，洒热血，写下了可歌可泣的英雄篇章。
    但是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却在革命队伍中鼓吹和推销他的活命哲学，投降哲学，叛徒哲学，公然与毛泽东思想唱反调。就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在抗日战争爆发前夕，指使别人自首变节，要他们投降国民党，叛变共产党，公开发表“反共启事”，宣誓“坚决反共”。这是何等可憎，何等可恨！这个自称为“老革命”的人，把他的画皮剥开来，原来是个地地道道的假革命、反革命。
    这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，不仅指使别人自首变节，而且还在大毒草《修养》中为叛徒制造“理论”根据，说什么“在反动派统治的环境下，在必要时还要放弃党的一些工作来保存同志”，等等。说穿了，就是在国民党白色恐怖之下，为了活命，可以出卖党的利益和党的原则，就象他自己在抗日战争爆发前夕，指使他的信徒在发表“反共启事”之后，从敌人的狱中爬出来一样。苏联的赫鲁晓夫宣扬什么“人死了，还要原则有什么用”，中国的赫鲁晓夫则鼓吹“在必要时还要放弃党的一些工作来保存同志”，“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”，嘴脸多么相似，腔调多么一致。这是彻头彻尾的反动资产阶级的活命论，都是反革命修正主义的叛徒哲学。几十年来，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫大搞招降纳叛、结党营私的勾当，就是这种叛徒哲学的最好的注脚。
    我是一个烈士的儿子。我的父亲彭咏梧、母亲江竹筠（江姐）和千千万万的先烈，为了革命的胜利，为了保卫伟大的毛泽东思想，英勇地献出了自己的生命。敌人把我父亲和其他几个同志的头割下来悬挂在城墙上，妄图以此把革命烈火压下去，但是，人民并没有屈服，革命的烈火越烧越旺。我的母亲在渣滓洞和白公馆那样的魔窟中，敌人把一根根竹签子钉进她的指头，她没有一丝呻吟，直到临刑前的最后一刻，她也“脸不变色，心不跳”。无数的革命先烈，就是这样宁可站着死，不愿跪着生，用自己的生命保卫毛泽东思想，保持了光荣的共产党员的崇高气节。“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”这就是我们无产阶级的生死观。在千千万万的革命先烈的英雄业绩面前，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所推行的叛徒哲学，显得多么卑鄙，多么肮脏。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，无数的英雄人物成长起来了。他们前赴后继，不怕牺牲，用鲜血浇灌了革命之花，用生命换来了祖国的解放。但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫却一贯实行投降主义，提出什么“和平民主新阶段”，并且俯首贴耳甘当帝国主义的买办，企图把革命的前辈用鲜血换来的江山拱手送给帝国主义和中国的买办资产阶级。他真是一个典型的民族投降主义者和阶级投降主义者。按照他的逻辑，中国还要回到旧中国去，人民还要当牛做马，永远受剥削。不过，历史的车轮是永远向前进的，最后被历史的车轮碾的粉碎的是一小撮反革命修正主义分子及其总后台——中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们红卫兵按照我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席的教导，“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”。经历了无数次的打击和围攻，我们终于“杀”出来了。在这场史无前例的大革命中，伟大的毛泽东思想给了我们无限的信心和勇气。现在，斗争已进入一个新的决战阶段，我们要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒哲学批透批臭，把他拉下马，让他靠边站，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想永远照亮全中国，照亮全世界！
