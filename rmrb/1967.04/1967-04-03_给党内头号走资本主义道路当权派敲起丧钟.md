	The bell tolls for the top capitalist-roader in the Party
	Vice-Chairman of the Core Group of the Red Guards' Revolutionary Committee of Beijing's Institutions of Higher Learning and Leader of the Red Flag of Beijing Aviation Institute, Han Aijing

	At this critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is at a decisive stage, the publication of the editorial article by the editorial board of the "Red Flag" magazine and the article by Comrade Chen Boda, along with their incisive criticism of the outline of the book "In Cultivation," has significant strategic importance. It signals the march to thoroughly criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party and to uproot the root of revisionism. The dream of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party, including the top capitalist-roader, to restore capitalism in China has been shattered.

	"To strike a snake, strike its head; to uproot a tree, uproot its roots." Through this mass criticism, using Mao Zedong Thought as the most powerful and sharpest weapon, we will thoroughly criticize and repudiate revisionist ideology, expose the true face of the Khrushchev-like personal careerist and conspirator in China, and let the whole Party and the whole nation condemn and overthrow him. This will ensure that the root of revisionism in our country is thoroughly uprooted, guaranteeing that our socialist country will remain unchanged for generations to come!

	The poisonous weed "In Cultivation" is nothing but a deception. It avoids discussing the revolutionary goal of seizing political power and avoids discussing the dictatorship of the proletariat. It spreads idealism, revisionism, individualism, and slave ideology, opposing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Now, through the criticism of this poisonous weed, not only will the Chinese people but also the people of the world no longer be deceived. Revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, especially revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary teachers, and students, will further realize that to become a true communist, one must study Mao Zedong Thought and transform oneself in the great waves of class struggle and in close unity with the workers and peasants, rather than staying in a room talking about "cultivation."

	To thoroughly eliminate the pernicious influence of "In Cultivation," it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses. This criticism must be closely linked to the struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and to the struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and smash the counter-revolutionary restoration tide. Among the broad revolutionary cadres and workers, peasants, and soldiers, a mass criticism movement must be launched. We are confident that this criticism will greatly promote the revolutionization of people's thinking and greatly advance the in-depth development of the Cultural Revolution, until the Cultural Revolution achieves complete victory.

    给党内头号走资本主义道路当权派敲起丧钟
    首都大专院校红代会核心组副组长、北航红旗负责人  韩爱晶
    正当无产阶级文化大革命处于决战的关键时刻，《红旗》杂志的评论员文章和戚本禹同志的文章的发表，以及其中对《修养》一书提纲挈领的批判，是有着重要的战略意义的。它吹响了彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派、挖掉修正主义的总根子的进军号。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子，妄图在中国实行资本主义反革命复辟的幻想破灭了。
    “打蛇要打在头上，刨树要刨在根上”。通过这次群众性的批判，用毛泽东思想这个最强大、最锐利的武器，大立毛泽东思想，大破修正主义思想，把中国赫鲁晓夫式的个人野心家和阴谋家的真面目，暴露在光天化日之下，全党共讨之，全国共诛之，就可以彻底挖掉我国修正主义的总根子，保证我国社会主义江山千秋万代不变色！
    《修养》这株大毒草，纯系欺人之谈，它闭口不谈革命的目的是夺取政权，闭口不谈无产阶级专政问题，向人们灌输唯心主义，修正主义，个人主义，奴隶主义，反对马克思列宁主义，反对毛泽东思想。现在，通过对《修养》大毒草的批判，不仅使中国人民，而且使世界人民不再上当，不再受骗。广大革命干部、革命群众，特别是革命知识分子，革命师生将会进一步认识到，要使自己成为一个真正的共产主义者，就要大学毛泽东思想，就要在阶级斗争的大风浪中，在同工农群众紧密结合的过程中改造自己，而不能关在房子里谈什么“修养”。
    为了彻底肃清《修养》的恶劣影响，必须充分发动群众。要使这一批判紧密结合向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行的夺权斗争，紧密结合批判资产阶级反动路线和粉碎反革命复辟逆流的斗争，在广大革命干部和工农兵群众中，掀起群众性的批判运动。我们深信，这次批判将大大促进人的思想革命化，大大推动文化大革命的深入发展，直至文化大革命的彻底胜利。
