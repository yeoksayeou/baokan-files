Vietnamese people praise Chairman Mao's initiation and leadership of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great innovation in the communist movement and a shining example for the revolutionary people of the world.

According to a report from our correspondent in Hanoi: The heroic Vietnamese people fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle have enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, as a turning point in history. This revolution has smashed the imperialists' and modern revisionists' plot to restore capitalism in China and has made immortal contributions to the revolutionary cause of the world's people. They pointed out that this is a great initiative under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, a necessary course for socialism, and a path that revolutionary people must follow.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, with its thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat that shakes the world, has attracted the Vietnamese people and many revolutionary cadres. Despite their busy combat and production schedules, they often listen to broadcasts from Beijing and read Chinese newspapers, closely following every victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

During the interviews, many Vietnamese comrades expressed their deep love for Chairman Mao and warmly congratulated the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. A responsible comrade from a province in North Vietnam told Chinese comrades, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is extremely great and wise, a great strategic deployment." He said, "Now, many problems in the world can be understood by looking at the Chinese Cultural Revolution and learning from Chairman Mao's works." A cadre from the Vietnamese People's Army said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China is a manifestation of thorough revolutionary spirit, and revolutionary people must follow this path. To prevent our descendants from becoming revisionists, we must carry out thorough revolutionary struggles like China."

Vietnamese workers and agricultural cooperative members, who are actively participating in production competitions to support the front lines, are greatly excited about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. A worker from a construction site in Lang Son Province visited the residence of Chinese comrades four times to view pictures of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He excitedly said, "I am thrilled and happy to see the photos of Chairman Mao with the revolutionary youngsters. Chairman Mao is a great revolutionary teacher, a red sun shining over the world. Mao Zedong Thought will surely illuminate the entire world." A worker from Hanoi, Comrade Kim, said, "The revolution underway in China is one that the world admires. We Vietnamese people have great trust and gratitude towards the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people's red sun, Mao Zedong."

A young comrade from Hanoi wrote in a letter, "Now, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are carrying out an unprecedented, world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The heroic spirit of the Chinese people, daring to struggle and daring to win, is the crystallization of great Mao Zedong Thought." He wrote in the letter, "I promise to Chairman Mao: I will follow your teachings, 'Be determined, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.' I will forever join the revolutionary struggle against imperialism and revisionism." The letter overflows with boundless admiration and love for the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao.

A cadre from the heroic port city of Hai Phong in North Vietnam said, "The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao is a great innovation in the communist movement, bringing great joy to the working people of the world and strengthening my confidence in the final victory of my country's struggle against American imperialism." He said, "I sincerely thank the great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, who are wholeheartedly helping my country defeat American imperialism. I am even more sincerely grateful to the beloved leader Chairman Mao for bringing the great innovation of the socialist revolution—the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—to the people of the world." He passionately shouted, "Long live the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"
