The CPC Central Committee sends a message of condolence to Comrades Gruba and others
Strongly protests the illegal arrest of Comrades Gruba and others by the Belgian reactionary authorities

New China News Agency, April 16th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belgium on the 12th, expressing sincere condolences to Comrades Gruba and others who were illegally arrested by the reactionary authorities during the anti-American demonstrations in Belgium on the 8th, and strongly protesting against this fascist atrocity by the Belgian authorities. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belgium
Dear Comrades in Brussels, Belgium:

We have learned that Comrades Gruba and others were illegally arrested by the reactionary authorities during the anti-American demonstrations in Belgium on April 8th. In the name of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, we strongly protest against this fascist atrocity by the Belgian authorities and express our sincere condolences to Comrades Gruba and others.

Comrade Mao Zedong said, "All the peoples of the world, unite! Drive out the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! Down with U.S. imperialism! Long live the victory of people's wars! The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history. The Chinese people have stood up. The Chinese people have always been the friends of the people of all countries and the enemies of all groups and individuals that infringe upon the interests of the people of other countries. The Chinese people will never allow any foreign imperialists to invade the territory of China. The Chinese people will never allow any foreign imperialists to oppress the Chinese people. The Chinese people will never allow any foreign imperialists to interfere in the internal affairs of China."

We will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and together with the Belgian people and the peoples of the world, we will carry on the struggle against American imperialism and its accomplices, modern revisionism of the Soviet Union, and all reactionaries to the end.

Long live proletarian internationalism!
Long live Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!
