The U.S. imperialist running dogs, the Suharto-Nasution rightist military clique in Indonesia, after seizing the presidential power and blatantly exposing the fascist nature of the military regime, in order to divert the increasingly sharp class contradictions within the country, are further colluding with and relying on U.S. imperialism and the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique. They are launching a new and unprecedented wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities across the country. This new crime by the Indonesian reactionaries is an important part of the anti-China grand chorus performed by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries. The Chinese government and people are closely watching this development.

The anti-China and anti-Chinese measures currently taken by the Indonesian fascist military regime are mainly as follows: on the one hand, imitating the tone of their masters, they slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and viciously distort the name of the People's Republic of China, worsening diplomatic relations between the two countries; on the other hand, they continue to incite rightist thugs to openly carry out large-scale attacks on overseas Chinese in various places, even deploying soldiers to carry out bloody suppression of overseas Chinese, and restoring and publicizing some anti-Chinese decrees to further expand the anti-Chinese violence across the country. Currently, the scale of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities in various parts of Indonesia is almost nationwide. The Indonesian fascist military regime blatantly tramples on the basic norms of international relations, ruthlessly tearing up all treaties and agreements between the governments of China and Indonesia regarding the issue of overseas Chinese. It openly implements a vicious policy of first stripping overseas Chinese of their property, cutting off their means of livelihood, and then expelling them, thereby depriving overseas Chinese of their right to exist in Indonesia. It also shamelessly implements a policy of incitement, division, bribery, and purchase among overseas Chinese and between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people, attempting to destroy the unity of overseas Chinese and the unity between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people.

Since last year, the anti-Chinese arrogance of the rightist reactionary forces in Indonesia has been increasingly rampant. In the Aceh region of North Sumatra, more than 90% of overseas Chinese have been forced to leave and have been forced into concentration camps. In South Sumatra and many other regions, the forced relocation of overseas Chinese below the county level has already begun. In West Kalimantan, the Indonesian reactionary government even openly colluded with "Malaysia," and both sides forcibly drove away overseas Chinese on both sides of the border. In East Java, the Indonesian reactionary authorities instigated reactionary officials, reactionary soldiers, and local thugs, and even openly deployed armed police to forcibly implement four anti-China and anti-Chinese decrees: prohibiting overseas Chinese from engaging in commerce, prohibiting overseas Chinese from moving within East Java, forcing overseas Chinese to pay a high "poll tax" per capita, and prohibiting overseas Chinese from using the Chinese language and script. This has launched an unprecedented wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities in the East Java region, forcing tens of thousands of overseas Chinese into a desperate situation with no means of livelihood, some families separated, homes destroyed, many overseas Chinese arrested, and some even driven to death.

After the forced relocation and expulsion of overseas Chinese in many regions, everything they operated has been completely seized by the reactionary authorities, and the meager means of livelihood they earned with their blood and sweat have also been plundered. In the Aceh region, where large-scale collective relocation of overseas Chinese is taking place, even the smallest street vendors have been forced to close down and have been subjected to looting. The crimes of the Indonesian reactionary authorities have further caused local prices to soar, goods to be scarce, local specialties to have no buyers, and the economy to be in chaos, with complaints everywhere. This is entirely the result of the evil deeds of the Indonesian reactionaries.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionary authorities in persecuting overseas Chinese have aroused many desperate overseas Chinese to unite and fight back. This self-defense struggle is entirely forced by the Indonesian reactionaries, and the resistance and self-defense of overseas Chinese are entirely just actions. However, the Indonesian reactionaries, against the unarmed overseas Chinese who are forced to defend themselves, have deployed large numbers of armed police to carry out brutal suppression, thus repeatedly causing bloody incidents. The recent incident in the city of Kediri, East Java, where armed police opened fire on overseas Chinese, is a new crime record written by the Indonesian reactionaries. It prominently exposes that the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities of the Indonesian reactionary government have become even more rampant, more extensive, and more unscrupulous. However, this will inevitably arouse greater resistance from overseas Chinese and will inevitably arouse greater indignation from the Indonesian people and the people of the world!

The mad anti-China and anti-Chinese activities of the Indonesian reactionary authorities expose the brutal and weak nature of the Suharto-Nasution military fascist regime and expose that the class contradictions within Indonesia are becoming increasingly sharp. It is precisely to maintain its precarious fascist regime that the Indonesian rightist military clique is eagerly using anti-China and anti-Chinese activities to curry favor with the U.S. and Soviet revisionists. According to reports, U.S. imperialism has recently agreed to provide the Indonesian rightist military regime with $80 million in "aid" this year and is preparing to resume "military aid" to Indonesia. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, due to the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China achievements, has provided the Indonesian rightist military regime with comprehensive political, economic, and military support, and has encouraged and supported the Indonesian reactionary regime in implementing fascist terrorist policies of anti-China, anti-communism, and anti-people. Moreover, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has agreed to extend the repayment period for the Indonesian rightist military regime's outstanding debt of $1.2 billion and is following in the footsteps of U.S. imperialism, preparing to invest in Indonesia and expand trade with Indonesia, and is ready to lend Indonesia $120 million to support the internally and externally besieged Indonesian reactionaries.

The anti-China farce jointly performed by the U.S., Soviet revisionists, and Indonesian reactionaries once again shows that they are the true enemies of Indonesian overseas Chinese and the common enemies of the Indonesian people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world. As our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The oppressors, aggressors, and threats to the absolute majority of nations and peoples in the world are a small handful of imperialists led by the United States and the reactionaries of various countries who support them." Chairman Mao also said: "The oppressed peoples and oppressed nations cannot entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle." The Indonesian reactionaries, in collusion with the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, are madly anti-China, which will only result in "lifting a rock to drop on one's own feet." They will absolutely not escape the punishment of history.

    加紧投靠美帝苏修　疯狂进行反华排华
    印尼反动派逃脱不了历史的惩罚
    美苏给予大量犒赏为印尼反动派支撑残局
    新华社十日讯　本社记者评述：美帝国主义在印度尼西亚的走狗苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团，在篡夺了总统权力、赤裸裸地露出了军人政权的法西斯面目以后，为了转移国内日益尖锐的阶级矛盾，正进一步勾结和投靠美帝国主义以及苏联现代修正主义领导集团，在全国各地掀起一个新的空前规模的反华排华浪潮。印尼反动派这一新的罪行，是当前帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派演出的反华大合唱的一个重要组成部分，中国政府和中国人民对此正予以密切注视。
    印尼法西斯军人政权目前所采取的反华排华措施主要是，一方面模仿它主子的腔调，诽谤中国的无产阶级文化大革命，并极其下流地篡改中华人民共和国的国名，恶化两国的外交关系；另一方面，继续唆使右派暴徒在各地公开大规模地袭击华侨，甚至出动军人对华侨进行血腥镇压，还恢复和公布一些排华法令，以使各地的排华暴行更加扩大。当前印尼各地反华排华的规模几乎遍及全国。印尼法西斯军人政权肆意践踏起码的国际关系准则，蛮横地撕毁中国和印尼两国政府间一切有关侨民问题的条约和协定。它对华侨露骨地实行一种先剥光财产，断绝生活出路，再驱逐出境，以剥夺华侨在印尼的生存权利的毒辣政策。它还在华侨内部，在华侨和印尼人民之间，无耻地实行挑拨、分化、利诱和收买的反动政策，妄图破坏华侨的团结，破坏华侨和印度尼西亚人民之间的团结。
    去年以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力排华的气焰就逐步嚣张起来。在北苏门答腊的亚齐地区，有百分之九十以上的华侨已被迫迁走，并被迫关进了集中营里。在南苏门答腊和其它许多地区，也已开始逼迁县以下地区的华侨。在西加里曼丹，印尼反动政府甚至与“马来西亚”公开勾结，双方把边界地区两边的华侨强行赶走。在东爪哇，印尼反动当局策动反动官僚、反动军人和地方恶棍，甚至公然出动武装军警，强行推行四项反华排华法令：禁止华侨经营商业，禁止华侨在东爪哇境内迁移，强迫华侨按人头缴纳高额“人头税”，禁止华侨使用中国的语言文字。这样，就在东爪哇地区掀起了一个空前规模的反华排华浪潮，使数以万计的华侨被逼得走投无路，生计断绝，有的妻离子散，家破人亡，许多华侨被逮捕，有些已被活活逼死。
    许多地区的华侨被驱逐、逼迁以后，他们经营的一切，已全部被反动当局所霸占，他们用血汗换来的仅有的生活资料，也被掠夺殆尽。在大规模集体迫迁华侨的亚齐地区，连最小的摊贩也被迫停业，并横遭抢掠。印尼反动当局的这些罪行，进一步促使当地物价猛涨，市面物资奇缺，土特产无人收购，经济一片混乱，到处怨声载道，这完全是印尼反动派所一手造成的恶果。
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。印尼反动当局迫害华侨的法西斯暴行，已激起了许多地方走投无路的华侨团结起来，进行自卫斗争。这种自卫斗争，完全是印尼反动派逼出来的，华侨的反抗自卫完全是正义的行动。而印尼反动派对被迫自卫的赤手空拳的华侨，又出动大批武装军警进行残酷镇压，这样就不断出现流血事件。东爪哇谏义里市最近发生的武装军警开枪镇压华侨的惨案，就是印尼反动派为自己写下的新的罪状，它突出地暴露了印尼反动政府反华排华的罪恶活动已经更加嚣张，更加扩大，更加不择手段了。但是，这必然会激起华侨的更大反抗，也必然会激起印尼人民和世界人民更大的痛恨！
    印尼反动当局的疯狂反华排华，暴露了苏哈托—纳苏蒂安军人法西斯政权残暴虚弱的本质，暴露了印尼国内的阶级矛盾正日益尖锐化。正是为了维持它的岌岌可危的法西斯政权，印尼右派军人集团极力利用反华排华向美帝和苏修邀功领赏。据报道，美帝国主义最近已同意在今年内给印尼右派军人政权提供八千万美元的“援助”，并准备恢复对印尼的“军事援助”。苏修领导集团由于印尼反动政府反华有功，给予了印尼右派军人政权以政治、经济、军事的全面支持，并鼓励和支持印尼反动政权实行反华、反共、反人民的法西斯恐怖政策。不仅如此，苏修领导集团还答应印尼右派军人政权延期偿还所欠下的为数达十二亿美元的债款，并紧跟美帝国主义的脚步，准备向印尼投资和扩大同印尼的贸易，并将向印尼贷款一亿二千万美元，以便向内外交困的印尼反动派输血。
    美帝、苏修、印尼反动派紧密合作演出的反华丑剧，再一次表明了它们是印尼华侨的真正敌人，是印尼人民、中国人民以及全世界革命人民的共同敌人。正如我们伟大的领袖毛主席所说的：“压迫、侵略和威胁全世界绝大多数民族和人民的，是以美国为首的一小撮帝国主义者和支持他们的各国反动派。”毛主席又说：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”印尼反动派联合美帝、苏修猖狂反华，只能“搬起石头打自己的脚”，它们绝对逃脱不了历史的惩罚。
