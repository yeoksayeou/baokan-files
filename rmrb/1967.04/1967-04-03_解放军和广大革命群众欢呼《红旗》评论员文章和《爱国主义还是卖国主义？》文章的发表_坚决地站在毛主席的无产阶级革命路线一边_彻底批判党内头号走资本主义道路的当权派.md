The People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of revolutionary people cheer the publication of the Red Flag editorial and "Is It Patriotism or Treason?"

Firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line

Thoroughly criticizing the capitalist-roaders within the Party

The People's Liberation Army

New China News Agency, April 2nd: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who have achieved great merits, enthusiastically cheer the publication of the editorial by the Red Flag magazine and the article "Is It Patriotism or Treason?" They unanimously point out that these two articles sound the battle cry for a general offensive against the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, fully expressing our firm will and determination. The cadres and soldiers unanimously declare that they will firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses of the whole country to thoroughly criticize and overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, uprooting the root of revisionism.

In recent days, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces have listened to the broadcasts of these two important articles over and over again. Everyone raises their arms and shouts: "Firmly overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party!" "Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!" "Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live our red sun, Chairman Mao!" The cadres, soldiers, and family members of the Navy leadership organ held a "Meeting to Launch a General Offensive Against the Biggest Capitalist-Roader Within the Party" today, braving the wind and rain. The cadres and soldiers of the Air Force, Wuhan Military Region, Guizhou, and Heilongjiang Military Districts, and many other units also held mobilization meetings and demonstrations, launching a fierce attack on the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. At the discussion meetings and denunciation meetings, they all said: The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is a Khruchev sleeping beside us. Exposing this biggest personal schemer and conspirator is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

The broad cadres and soldiers, in their meetings and discussions, criticized "On Cultivation" this black book with their own experiences. They pointed out: This is the poisonous weed used by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party to corrupt the souls of revolutionary people. Following "On Cultivation" to "cultivate" will only make one more "cultivated" and more revisionist. We must thoroughly criticize this black book and eliminate its evil influence. The cadres and soldiers of the "Sea Pioneer Boat" said: The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the rain and sunshine that nurtures the growth of revolutionary soldiers. Vice Chairman Lin Biao called on us: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." This is how we established the spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death and serving the people wholeheartedly. However, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party has long opposed Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously promoting his "On Cultivation," advocating idealism, and promoting individualism and servility. Following such "cultivation," it is impossible to become a revolutionary soldier who fears neither hardship nor death. We must thoroughly criticize "On Cultivation" with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The cadres and soldiers of a certain unit in the Shaanxi Military District said: The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party attempted to corrupt our souls with "On Cultivation," wanting us to detach from the struggle and "reform" ourselves into revisionists behind closed doors. This is simply a pipe dream. We firmly listen to Chairman Mao's words, kick away this black commodity, and throw ourselves into the fiery revolutionary struggle, joining the revolutionary masses to launch a fierce general offensive against the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party.

The broad cadres and soldiers also angrily pointed out that this Chinese Khruchev has consistently opposed our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, and Mao Zedong Thought. Today, we must settle accounts with him thoroughly. Many old soldiers who fought in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region said: Every time history reaches a turning point, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party jumps out to sing the opposite tune to Chairman Mao, peddling his set of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. When the U.S.-Chiang bandits were actively preparing to launch a civil war, and Chairman Mao issued the battle cry of "counterattack in kind, not an inch of land to be yielded," the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party went behind Chairman Mao's back and proposed the reactionary fallacy of the "new stage of peace and democracy," pushing a policy of surrender and compromise to the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. As a result, the Jin-Cha-Ji border region was in a state of complete unpreparedness when Chiang Kai-shek launched the civil war, suffering unnecessary losses. If it were not for our great leader, Chairman Mao, criticizing and rectifying this line of surrender, we would not have won the victory of the whole country. The cadres and soldiers of the 2nd Company of a certain unit in the Beijing Garrison Command said in a discussion: This biggest capitalist-roader within the Party shamelessly claims to be an "old revolutionary facing new problems." What "old revolutionary" is he? The facts show that he is an unrepentant counter-revolutionary! He wants others to surrender and betray; he advocates "peace and democracy" to the Nationalist reactionaries; he opposes agricultural cooperatives and slashes them; he advocates "three freedoms and one reduction"; he opposes our study of Chairman Mao's works but wants us to study his revisionist black book "On Cultivation"; in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he colludes with another biggest capitalist-roader within the Party to propose and implement a bourgeois reactionary line, opposing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. When has he ever "revolved"? He is a thorough counter-revolutionary.

Special Class Hero, Deputy Regiment Commander Yang Yucai of the Jinan Military Region said: We are the people's army created by Chairman Mao and the resolute executors and defenders of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must, together with the revolutionary people of the whole country, organize a vast army of proletarian cultural revolution, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party has implemented in politics, economy, culture, education, and other fields. We must eliminate its poisonous influence, letting the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shine over the whole country and the whole world.

Beijing

According to New China News Agency, April 2nd: At the moment when the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved great victories, the broad revolutionary masses of the capital have surged into a vast revolutionary torrent, gathering at Tiananmen Square to hold meetings and demonstrations.

Tiananmen Square is filled with red flags. Squad after squad of the cultural revolution army, carrying the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, strides forward with high spirits, repeatedly raising their arms and shouting: "Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!" "Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Overthrow, overthrow, and thoroughly expose the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party!" "Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

During the demonstrations and meetings, the broad revolutionary masses of the capital spoke out, distributing a large number of materials, exposing that the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is not an "old revolutionary" at all but a fake revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary, a Khruchev sleeping beside us. A representative of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Revolutionary Workers' Congress said: The important article "Is It Patriotism or Treason?" has struck at the heart of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, exposing his rotten background. To defend Chairman Mao, to defend Mao Zedong Thought, to defend the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the working class, are willing to sacrifice ourselves and are determined to pull the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party down from his horse!

Many old workers of the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory angrily denounced the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party for saying that "the working people do not oppose exploitation but welcome it." They pointed out: This is completely speaking from the standpoint of landlords and capitalists, a great slander against our working class and the working people! Only those who, like the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, turn treason into patriotism would welcome exploitation. Because he dreams of restoring the capitalist system of exploitation.

The revolutionary peasants of the suburbs of Beijing, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and boundless indignation towards the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, sternly exposed the various crimes of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Haidian Commune said: The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party has been promoting class reconciliation in the countryside, advocating the theory of the extinction of class struggle, and shouting "long-term protection of the rich peasant economy," fully exposing his ugly face of speaking for landlords and rich peasants, exposing his great conspiracy of counter-revolutionary restoration. We poor and lower-middle peasants will never agree! An old poor peasant excitedly said: It's true, different classes speak differently! We have followed Chairman Mao closely, fighting against class enemies for decades, but that biggest capitalist-roader within the Party told us to detach from revolutionary struggle and talk about "cultivation" behind closed doors. He also advocated "four freedoms," promoting "three freedoms and one reduction," "three harmonies and one reduction." Isn't this barefaced exposure of his attempt at capitalist restoration? The more we think about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the more we love our great leader Chairman Mao. We will definitely stand on Chairman Mao's side forever, overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, thoroughly, completely, cleanly, and entirely eliminate the evil influence of his stinking "Cultivation," and follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life!

The Standing Committee of the Beijing College and University Red Guards Representatives' Congress today issued an urgent mobilization order, calling on the Red Guards to launch a comprehensive and fierce general offensive against the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. The mobilization order calls on the Red Guards to thoroughly settle accounts with the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party's heinous crimes of being anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought; thoroughly criticize his bourgeois reactionary line on cadre issues, firmly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy; thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line he proposed and implemented, deeply carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform, and launch a new high tide of the Cultural Revolution; thoroughly criticize his revisionist "Cultivation," thoroughly uproot the root of revisionism. The young Red Guards of the "August 18th" of Beijing Medical College said: "Cultivation" is a big poisonous weed against Mao Zedong Thought, a big hodgepodge of capitalism, feudalism, and revisionism, a declaration of the restoration of capitalism in China, the theoretical basis of counter-revolutionary revisionism, and the root of the bourgeois reactionary line. We must overthrow and expose "Cultivation." We will firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, reform everything, and create a new world of red.

The overseas Chinese students of Beijing Foreign Studies University said: We will never forget that our parents were under the cruel oppression of the so-called "progress and brightness," "exploitation is innocent, rebellion is unreasonable" in the old China that the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party praised so much, leaving their homes and crossing the ocean. It was our great leader Chairman Mao who led the people to liberate the whole country, making us thousands and millions of overseas orphans have a strong backing. We must thoroughly smash the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party's conspiracy to seize the Party and the country, restore capitalism. The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of the Beijing Half-Work Half-Study Mechanical Industry School said: That biggest capitalist-roader within the Party who wrote "Cultivation" also opposed and resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, advocating the revisionist educational system everywhere, attempting to cultivate revisionist successors, and restore capitalism. We, the Red Guards armed with great Mao Zedong Thought, can see through all the tricks of the class enemy. We will definitely throw the revisionist educational system he advocated into the trash can, letting the great Mao Zedong Thought illuminate all educational fronts.

Shanxi

According to New China News Agency, April 2nd: The broad revolutionary masses of Shanxi Province enthusiastically cheer the publication of the editorial by the Red Flag magazine and the article "Is It Patriotism or Treason?" They held meetings and demonstrations, angrily denouncing the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party's evil activities of attempting to restore capitalism in China.

The Taigu No. 1-26 Textile Factory (formerly Taigu Textile Factory) held a denunciation meeting and demonstration with more than a thousand people. At the meeting, the active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Xie Yue, angrily said: The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party stubbornly stands on the reactionary bourgeois position, for the restoration of capitalism, saying that "the working people do not oppose exploitation but welcome it," "the more exploitation, the greater the merit, the more glorious," and so on. This is a great slander against our working class, a thorough counter-revolutionary fallacy! The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party who says these words is in cahoots with landlords and capitalists. We, the working class, and the broad working people have suffered enough from those cannibalistic, blood-sucking reactionaries in the old society. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, we have stood up. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is attempting to restore capitalism again, and we workers will never agree. We must overthrow him!

The deputy director of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, the party secretary of the Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, and the national labor model Chen Yonggui said after listening to the broadcast of the Red Flag magazine's article: The article published in the Red Flag magazine is excellent. This article exposes the true face of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, who pretends to be an "old revolutionary," greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary masses and greatly suppressing the arrogance of a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Chen Yonggui said: For more than a decade, we in Dazhai Brigade have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's guidance, self-reliant and striving for progress, turning a poor old Dazhai into a prosperous and advanced socialist new Dazhai, receiving the highest praise from our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. However, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party dared to sing the opposite tune to Chairman Mao, actively advocating the development of capitalist economy in the countryside, opposing the socialist transformation of the countryside; during the three years of difficulty, he also viciously attacked the Three Red Banners, advocating "three freedoms and one reduction," attempting to restore capitalism in China. Under the protection of his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, a small handful of big and small capitalist-roaders within the Party have done everything possible to oppose Dazhai, plotting to chop down the red flag personally raised by Chairman Mao, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism in the countryside. The cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai Brigade, inspired by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have withstood this counter-revolutionary tide and exposed a small handful of big and small capitalist-roaders within the Party in this Cultural Revolution.

However, to uproot the grass, we must dig out the roots. These guys' root is the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. We must press on and strike hard, thoroughly uprooting this poisonous root, thoroughly overthrowing and exposing this Khruchev sleeping beside us, ensuring that our great socialist country will never change color!

The famous national labor model Li Shunda, after listening to the broadcast, excitedly said: Chairman Mao led us poor and lower-middle peasants to take the collective path, the socialist path, but the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party opposed Chairman Mao, advocating individual farming, promoting "three freedoms and one reduction," "three harmonies and one reduction," singing the same tune as modern revisionism, wanting to drag our country back to the old capitalist road, wanting us poor and lower-middle peasants to be slaves again. We will never agree, ten thousand times no! Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will fight with him; whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight with him to the end, no matter how high his position is, we will definitely pull him down from his horse, let him stand aside, and firmly follow the socialist bright path indicated by Chairman Mao!

The Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Corps held a meeting at Wuyi Square today, angrily denouncing the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. The representatives of various combat organizations at the meeting angrily declared: We will definitely carry forward Lu Xun's spirit of beating fallen dogs, thoroughly overthrowing and exposing the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, all counter-revolutionary revisionists, making them never rise again! We will defend our socialist homeland forever! After the meeting, the warriors of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Corps held a grand demonstration.

Shandong

According to New China News Agency, April 2nd: The broad revolutionary workers, peasants, students, and cadres of Shandong Province, after seeing the articles "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on Cadres Must Be Criticized" and "Is It Patriotism or Treason?" published in the Red Flag magazine, angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and vow to pull the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party down from his horse, overthrowing, overthrowing, and thoroughly exposing him!

The third plenary meeting of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, which ended on April 2nd, called on the revolutionary masses of the whole province to mobilize urgently, launching a fierce attack on the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, thoroughly smashing the counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy of the class enemy, consolidating and developing the victory of the seizure of power, carrying out the revolution, promoting production, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The meeting believed that the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shandong Province is excellent and getting better. This is the mainstream. However, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has not ended but is continuing in various new forms, sharply and fiercely. A small handful of overthrown capitalist-roaders within the Party are still alive, and their hearts are not dead. They have joined forces with the reactionary elements of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society, stirring up a counter-revolutionary restoration tide of capitalism. This is not isolated but is closely linked with the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party's evil activities of opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, a life-and-death serious class struggle. The revolutionary masses must not be complacent because of victory but must respond to Chairman Mao's call, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, bravely join the battle, thoroughly criticize and eliminate the poisonous influence of the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party in all aspects, thoroughly smashing the counter-revolutionary restoration tide of capitalism.

The broad revolutionary workers of factories, mines, and enterprises in Jinan City held meetings, denouncing the crimes of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. The original company commander of the "Good Eighth Company" on Nanjing Road, Met Newlin, a standing committee member of the Jinan First Machine Tool Factory Revolutionary Committee, said: The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party slanders us workers as "welcoming exploitation," which is a thoroughly reactionary fallacy. He wants to restore capitalism in China, making us working people live a life worse than cattle and horses again. We will never agree, ten thousand times no! We revolutionary workers and the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party are like water and fire, incompatible. We must pull him down from his horse and make him stand aside. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of the suburbs of Jinan, after listening to the broadcast, said: Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline! The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party dares to oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to restore capitalism in China, making landlords and capitalists ride on our heads again, making us suffer again. We will never agree! We must overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, overthrow him, overthrow him, and thoroughly expose him!

The revolutionary young warriors of Shandong Medical College said with high spirits: The publication of "Is It Patriotism or Treason?" has blown the bugle for a general offensive against the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. We must immediately join the battle. If we do not firmly overthrow the Chinese Khruchev, if we do not uproot the root of revisionism, our country will change color and head towards capitalist restoration. The revolutionary young warriors of this college have been criticizing the big poisonous weed "Cultivation" written by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party since January this year. They said: This "Cultivation," which opposes Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, advocates bourgeois individualism, is a preparation for the public opinion of capitalist restoration. We must raise the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticizing, criticizing, and exposing it.

Guizhou

According to New China News Agency, April 2nd: The revolutionary masses of the Guizhou region enthusiastically cheer the publication of the Red Flag magazine's articles "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on Cadres Must Be Criticized" and "Is It Patriotism or Treason?" They held meetings and demonstrations this morning, angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, raise the thousand-pound hammer, and thoroughly smash the fierce attack of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, thoroughly overthrowing, overthrowing, and exposing him.

At the denunciation meeting, the broad revolutionary workers, peasants, students, cadres, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," loudly read: "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist. They will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies. If we do not put forward and understand the problem in this way now, we will make a great mistake." The meeting was filled with indignation, shouting slogans: "Firmly overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party!"

The Standing Committee of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Qi Xiu, in his speech, pointed out: For a long time, a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Guizhou Province have dared not listen to Chairman Mao's words but listen to the black words of their ancestor—the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, treating it as a "sacred decree," faithfully executing it. They collude up and down, actively promoting counter-revolutionary revisionism in Guizhou, attempting to turn Guizhou into a rear base for the restoration of capitalism. In recent years, they have made Guizhou a mess, with capitalism rampant in cities and countryside. If their conspiracy succeeds, our country will change color.

Qi Xiu emphasized: The "Cultivation" carefully concocted by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is a big poisonous weed against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We, the proletarian revolutionary masses, must rise up to criticize it verbally and in writing, uprooting this big poisonous weed.

After the meeting, a grand demonstration was held. The chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the deputy political commissar of the Guizhou Military District Li Zaihan, the deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Committee Zhang Ming, the Standing Committee member Li Li, and the leaders of the Guizhou Military District Wu Rongzheng, Tian Hua, Chen Jiedi, and Xue Guang, together with the revolutionary masses and the cadres and soldiers of the units, participated in the demonstration.

More than four thousand representatives attending the Guizhou Provincial Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representatives Conference in Guiyang, representing the revolutionary peasants of the Han, Miao, Bouyei, Dong, Yi, and other ethnic groups in the province, participated in today's denunciation meeting and demonstration. The poor and lower-middle peasants' representative, the deputy platoon leader of the militia, and the Miao youth member Mo Wenguang from Leishan County's No. 1 Commune said: The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party wants to restore capitalism, sabotaging socialism. A few years ago, he advocated "three freedoms and one reduction," dividing land to households for individual farming, attempting to collapse the people's communes, pulling the Miao people onto the capitalist road. The mountains cannot block the sun. The great leader Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the Miao people. We will definitely follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, firmly taking the socialist road, consolidating the collective economy. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, whoever dares to sabotage socialism, we will firmly overthrow him!

    解放军和广大革命群众欢呼《红旗》评论员文章和《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》文章的发表
    坚决地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边
    彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派
    解放军
    新华社二日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命中立下丰功伟绩的人民解放军广大指战员，在热烈欢呼《红旗》杂志第五期评论员文章和《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》文章的发表时，一致指出，这两篇文章擂响了向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派展开总攻击的战鼓，充分表达了我们的坚强意志和决心。指战员们一致表示，最坚决地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，和全国无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，坚决打倒并彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，挖掉修正主义的总根子。
    连日来，人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员，一遍又一遍地收听这两篇重要文章的广播，人人振臂高呼：“坚决打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派！”“以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”海军领导机关的干部、战士和家属，今天冒着风雨举行了“向党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派发起总攻击大会”。空军、武汉部队、贵州和黑龙江省军区等许多部队的指战员，还举行了誓师大会和示威游行，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火。他们在座谈会和声讨会上纷纷说：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，是睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫。把这个最大的个人野心家、阴谋家揪了出来，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    广大指战员在集会座谈中，纷纷以切身体会，批判《论修养》这本黑书。他们指出：这是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派腐蚀革命人民灵魂的大毒草，照《论修养》去“修养”，只能越养越“修”，“越修养”越成为修正主义。我们一定要对这本黑书进行彻底批判，肃清它的恶劣影响。“海上先锋艇”指战员说：战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是哺育我们革命战士成长的雨露和阳光。林彪副主席号召我们：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”。我们就是这样树立了一不怕苦，二不怕死，全心全意地为人民服务的思想。而党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，长期以来反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，拚命地推行他的《论修养》，宣扬唯心主义，提倡个人主义、奴隶主义。照这样“修养”下去，那就根本不可能成为一不怕苦、二不怕死的革命战士。我们一定要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想彻底批判《论修养》。山西省军区某部指战员说，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，妄图用《论修养》腐蚀我们的灵魂，要我们脱离斗争，闭门“改造”成为修正主义分子，这简直是白日作梦。我们坚决听毛主席的话，踢开这个黑货，投身到火热的革命斗争中去，同无产阶级革命派一道，向党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派发动猛烈总攻击。
    广大指战员还愤怒指出，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫反对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，反对伟大的毛泽东思想是一贯的，由来已久的。今天，我们一定要彻底清算他。南京部队某部许多当年战斗在晋察冀边区的老战士说，每到历史转折关头，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派总是跳出来，和毛主席唱反调，推销他的一套反革命修正主义黑货。在美蒋匪帮积极准备发动内战，毛主席发出“针锋相对，寸土必争”的战斗号召时，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派竟背着毛主席，提出了所谓“和平民主新阶段”的反动谬论，推行对卖国贼蒋介石投降妥协的政策，以致造成晋察冀边区在蒋介石发动内战时，处于毫无准备的状态，遭到不应有的损失。要不是我们伟大领袖毛主席批判和纠正了这条投降主义路线，我们就不可能取得全中国的胜利。北京卫戍区某部二连指战员在座谈中说，这个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派恬不知耻地说他是“老革命遇到新问题”。他是什么“老革命”，种种事实说明，他是个不折不扣的老反革命！他要别人自首变节；他对国民党反动派“和平民主”；他反对农业合作化、大砍合作社；他鼓吹“三自一包”、“三和一少”；他反对我们学习毛主席著作，却要我们学他那本修正主义的黑书《论修养》；在无产阶级文化大革命中，他又和另一个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派互相勾结，提出和推行一条资产阶级反动路线，对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，破坏文化大革命。他什么时候“革命”过？他是个彻头彻尾的反革命。
    特等功臣、济南部队某部副团长杨育才说，我们是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，是毛主席革命路线的坚决执行者和保卫者，我们一定要同全国广大革命人民一起，组织起浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，高举革命的批判旗帜，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在政治、经济、文化、教育等方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线批深批透，彻底肃清其流毒，让毛泽东思想的光辉普照全中国，普照全世界。
    北京
    据新华社二日讯　在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得伟大胜利的时刻，首都广大无产阶级革命派汇成巨大的革命洪流，涌到天安门广场举行集会和游行示威。
    天安门广场上，红旗飘舞，一队队文化革命大军抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，斗志昂扬地阔步前进，不断振臂高呼：“以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！”“把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    首都广大革命群众在游行和集会时纷纷发表讲话，散发大量材料，揭露了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派根本不是什么“老革命”，而是假革命、反革命，是睡在我们身旁的赫鲁晓夫。北京革命职工代表会议常务委员会的代表说，《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》这篇重要文章，狠狠地刺中了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的心脏，揭露了他的臭家底。为了保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫以毛主席为首的党中央，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，我们工人阶级舍得一身剐，誓把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派拉下马！
    北京光华木材厂许多老工人，愤怒谴责党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派胡说什么“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削。”他们指出：这完全是站在地主、资本家的立场上说话，这是对我们工人阶级和劳动人民的最大污蔑！只有象党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派那样把卖国主义说成是爱国主义的家伙，才欢迎剥削。因为他梦想的就是恢复资本主义剥削制度。
    京郊广大革命农民满怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和对党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的无比愤慨，义正词严地揭露了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的种种罪行。海淀公社的贫下中农说：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在农村大搞阶级调和，鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，还大叫“长期保护富农经济”，完全暴露了他替地主富农说话的丑恶嘴脸，暴露了他搞反革命复辟的大阴谋。我们贫下中农一万个不答应！一位老贫农激动地说：真是什么阶级说什么话呀！我们紧紧跟着毛主席，同阶级敌人斗争了几十年，可是那个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却叫我们脱离开革命斗争空讲什么“修养”，他还鼓吹什么“四大自由”，主张什么“三自一包”、“三和一少”，这不是赤裸裸地暴露了他在搞资本主义复辟吗！我们越是想到毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，就越热爱我们的伟大领袖毛主席。我们一定永远站在毛主席一边，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派打倒在地，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地肃清他那本臭《修养》的恶劣影响，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命！
    首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会委员会，今天发出紧急动员令，号召红卫兵战士向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派发起全面地、猛烈地总攻击。动员令号召红卫兵战士们，全面彻底地清算党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行；全面彻底地批判他在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”方针；全面彻底地批判他提出和推行的资产阶级反动路线，深入开展斗、批、改，掀起一个文化大革命的新高潮；全面彻底地批判他的修正主义的《论修养》，彻底挖掉修正主义总根子。北京医学院“八一八”红卫兵小将说，《论修养》是一株反毛泽东思想的大毒草，它是资本主义、封建主义、修正主义三位一体的大杂烩，是要在中国复辟资本主义的宣言书，是反革命修正主义的理论基础，是资产阶级反动路线的总根子。我们必须把《论修养》批倒、批臭，我们要大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树毛主席革命路线的绝对权威，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，改造一切，创立一个红彤彤的新世界。北京华侨大学的归国华侨学生说：我们永远不会忘记，我们的父辈就是在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派百般颂扬的所谓“进步和光明”、“剥削无罪，造反无理”的旧中国的残酷压迫下，背井离乡、远渡重洋的。是我们伟大的领袖毛主席领导广大人民解放了全中国，才使我们千千万万的海外孤儿有了强大的靠山。我们一定要彻底粉碎党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派妄图篡党、篡国，复辟资本主义的阴谋。北京市半工半读机械工业学校的红卫兵战士和革命师生说：那个搞《论修养》的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，还对抗和抵制毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，到处鼓吹修正主义的教育制度，妄图培养修正主义的接班人，搞资本主义复辟。我们用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵能识破阶级敌人一切阴谋诡计。我们一定把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹的修正主义的教育制度扔进垃圾堆，让伟大的毛泽东思想照亮一切教育阵地。

    新华社太原二日电　山西省广大无产阶级革命派热烈欢呼《红旗》杂志第五期评论员文章和《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》文章的发表。他们纷纷集会和举行示威游行，愤怒声讨党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派企图在中国实现资本主义复辟的罪恶活动。
    太原一·二六纺织厂（原太原纺织厂）举行了一千多人的声讨大会和示威游行。会上，学习毛主席著作积极分子解悦愤怒地说：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派顽固地站在资产阶级反动立场上，为了复辟资本主义，胡说什么“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削”，“剥削得越多，功劳越大，就越光荣”等等。这是对我们工人阶级极大的污蔑，这是地地道道的反革命谬论！说这些话的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就是和地主、资本家一个鼻孔出气的。我们工人阶级和广大劳动人民在旧社会受尽了那些吃人肉、吸人血的反动家伙的苦头。在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，我们才翻了身。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派又妄图实行资本主义复辟，我们工人绝不答应，我们一定要把他打倒、斗臭！我们要坚决沿着毛主席指引的方向乘胜前进！
    山西省革命委员会副主任、昔阳县大寨大队党支部书记、全国劳动模范陈永贵听了《红旗》杂志的文章广播后说：《红旗》杂志上发表的这篇文章太好了。这篇文章戳穿了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所谓“老革命”的画皮，揭露了他的反革命真面目，大长了我们无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的威风。陈永贵说，十几年来，我们大寨大队沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的社会主义道路，自力更生，奋发图强，把一个穷困的旧大寨，建设成一个富强的先进的社会主义新大寨，得到了我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的最高评价。可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，竟胆敢和毛主席唱反调，他积极鼓吹发展农村的资本主义经济，反对农村社会主义改造；在三年困难时期，他又恶毒地攻击三面红旗，提倡什么“三自一包”，妄想在中国复辟资本主义。在他这条反革命修正主义路线的包庇下，党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路的当权派，千方百计地反对大寨，阴谋把毛主席亲自树起的这面红旗砍掉，为在农村复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。我们大寨大队的干部和贫下中农，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，顶住了这股反革命逆流，并且在这次文化大革命中把党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来了。
    但是，铲草必须除根，这些家伙的总根子就是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，我们一定要乘胜前进，猛打穷追，彻底挖掉这个毒根，把这个睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫彻底斗倒斗臭，保证我们伟大的社会主义国家永远不变颜色！
    全国著名劳动模范李顺达听了广播后激动地说：毛主席领导我们贫下中农走集体化道路，走社会主义道路，可是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派反对毛主席，提倡单干，搞“三自一包”，“三和一少”，和现代修正主义唱一个调子，要把我国拖向资本主义老路，要我们贫下中农再当牛马，做奴隶，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应！谁反对毛主席，我们就要和他拚，谁反对毛泽东思想，我们就和他斗争到底，不管他官有多大，地位有多高，我们坚决要把他拉下马，让他靠边站，坚决走毛主席指引的社会主义光明大道！
    山西革命造反兵团今天也在五一广场集会，愤怒声讨党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。各个战斗组织的代表在会上愤怒表示：我们坚决发扬鲁迅痛打落水狗的精神，彻底把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，把一切反革命修正主义分子，打倒斗臭，使他们永世不得翻身！誓死保卫我国社会主义江山永不变色。会后，山西革命造反兵团的战士们举行了声势浩大的游行示威。

    据新华社济南二日电　山东省广大的革命工人、革命农民、革命学生和革命干部，看到《红旗》杂志发表的文章《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》和《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》以后，愤怒声讨党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派拉下马，把他斗倒，斗垮，斗臭！
    四月二日结束的山东省革命委员会第三次全体会议，号召全省无产阶级革命派紧急动员起来，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的反革命复辟阴谋，巩固和发展夺权斗争的胜利，抓革命，促生产，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。会议认为，当前山东省无产阶级文化大革命的形势大好，而且越来越好，这是主流。但是，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，并没有结束，而是以各种新的形式继续尖锐激烈地进行着。一小撮被无产阶级革命派推翻的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，人还在，心不死，他们同社会上坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子结合起来，掀起一股资本主义反革命复辟逆流。这绝不是孤立的，是与党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派反毛主席、反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动紧密地联系在一起的，是一场你死我活的严重的阶级斗争。无产阶级革命派决不可因为胜利而麻痹起来，一定要响应毛主席的号召，高举革命的批判的旗帜，勇敢地投入战斗，彻底批判和肃清以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线在各方面的流毒，彻底粉碎资本主义反革命复辟逆流。
    济南市厂矿企业广大革命职工纷纷举行集会，声讨党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。原南京路上好八连班长、济南第一机床厂革命委员会常委顾新林说：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派诬蔑我们工人“欢迎剥削”，这是反动透顶的谬论。他妄想在中国复辟资本主义，叫我们劳动人民再过牛马不如的生活，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。我们革命工人和党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是水火不相容的，一定要把他拉下马，叫他靠边站。济南郊区广大贫下中农收听了广播之后表示：毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子！党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，竟敢反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，妄图在中国实行资本主义复辟，让地主、资产阶级重新骑在我们头上，让我们重新受罪，我们就是不答应！我们一定要把这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派斗倒，斗垮，斗臭！
    山东医学院的革命小将斗志昂扬地说，《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》的发表，吹响了向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派展开总攻击的进军号，我们要立即投入战斗，不把中国的赫鲁晓夫坚决斗倒，不挖出修正主义的总根子，我们国家就要改变颜色，走向资本主义复辟。这个学院的革命小将，从今年一月开始就批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派写的那本大毒草《论修养》。他们说，这本反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，宣扬资产阶级个人主义的《论修养》，是为资本主义复辟作舆论准备的。我们要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把它彻底批深、批透、批臭。
    贵阳
    新华社贵阳二日电　贵阳地区无产阶级革命派热烈欢呼《红旗》杂志文章《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》和《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》的发表，今天上午举行集会和示威游行，愤怒声讨党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。各族革命人民表示要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋起千钧棒，彻底粉碎党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的猖狂进攻，把他彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
    在声讨大会上，广大革命工人、农民、学生、机关干部和解放军的代表，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高声朗读：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。如果我们现在不是这样地提出问题和认识问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。”会场上群情激愤，高呼口号：“坚决打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派！”
    贵州省革命委员会常委戚休在会上讲话。他着重指出：贵州省党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，长期以来竟敢不听毛主席的话，专听他们的祖师爷——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的黑话，把它当做“圣旨”，忠实执行。他们上下串通，在贵州积极推行反革命修正主义，妄图把贵州变成复辟资本主义的后方。这些年来，他们已经把贵州搞得乌烟瘴气，城乡资本主义泛滥。如果让他们的阴谋得逞，我们的国家就要改变颜色。
    戚休强调指出：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派精心炮制的《论修养》，是反对马克思列宁主义，反对毛泽东思想的大毒草，我们无产阶级革命派，要奋起口诛笔伐，把这株大毒草连根铲掉。
    会后进行了声势浩大的示威游行。贵州省革命委员会主任委员、贵州省军区副政治委员李再含，省革命委员会副主任委员张明，省革命委员会常委李立，以及贵州省军区领导人吴荣正、田化一、陈捷第、薛光等同志同革命群众和部队指战员一起参加了游行。
    正在贵阳出席贵州省贫下中农代表会议的四千多名代表，代表全省一千五百万汉、苗、布依、侗、彝、水等民族的革命农民，参加了今天的声讨大会和示威游行。雷山县五一公社贫下中农代表、民兵副连长、苗族青年社员莫文光说：党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派一心想搞资本主义复辟，破坏社会主义。前几年，他就鼓吹什么“三自一包”，分田到户搞单干，想把人民公社搞垮，把我们苗族人民拉到资本主义道路上去。山高挡不住太阳，伟大的领袖毛主席是我们苗家人民心中最红最红的红太阳，我们一定按照毛主席他老人家指引的方向走，坚决走社会主义道路，巩固集体经济。谁胆敢反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想，谁胆敢破坏社会主义，我们就坚决把他打倒！
