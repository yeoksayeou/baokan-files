The organ of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), the "Pioneer," published an article on April 6, enthusiastically praising Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and strongly refuting the slanders and defamations of imperialism and modern revisionism against China.

The article points out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has attracted more attention from the world than any other event in the contemporary world, and this is a clear fact." The article says: "China has gained the broad support, understanding, and sympathy of the people of the world. Every anti-China movement launched by U.S. imperialism has backfired."

The article points out that the people of the world revolution have deep feelings for Mao Zedong Thought. "Today, China and Mao Zedong are the center of attraction for all the oppressed."

The article strongly condemns the imperialists' and revisionists' shameless slanders and abuse against China. The article says that their "attacks, clamor, abuse, and threats against China are all in vain. They are only lifting a rock to drop it on their own feet." The article points out that the enemy's attempt to isolate China "can only help the people understand and support China. China has friends all over the world."

The article says: "The Soviet revisionists are the greatest traitors in history. Precisely because of this, they are truly isolated and will remain isolated. Of course, the people must wage a struggle against them."

The article says: "We are living in a very optimistic era. The victory of socialism is beyond doubt. Mao Zedong's great call indeed inspires millions: 'The people of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! The people of the world must dare to struggle, must not fear sacrifice, and must advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All the monsters of the world will be routed!'"

    澳《先锋报》严斥帝修对中国文化大革命的无耻诬蔑
    苏修是史无前例的大叛徒
    新华社墨尔本电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》六日发表文章，热烈颂扬毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命，严厉驳斥帝国主义和现代修正主义对中国的诽谤和诬蔑。
    文章指出：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命比当代任何其他事件都更引起全世界的注意，这已是明显的事实。”文章说：“中国得到了全世界人民广泛的支持、了解和同情。美帝国主义者发动的每一个（反华）运动都走向了它的反面。”
    文章指出，世界革命人民“对于毛泽东思想有着深厚的感情”，“今天，中国和毛泽东是吸引一切被压迫者的中心。”
    文章痛斥帝国主义者和修正主义者对中国的无耻诽谤和谩骂。文章说，他们对中国的“攻击、叫嚣、谩骂和威胁都是白费力气的。他们只是搬起石头打自己的脚”。文章指出，敌人妄图孤立中国的行径“只能帮助人民了解和支持中国。中国的朋友遍天下。”
    文章说：“苏联修正主义者是史无前例的最大的叛徒。正因为这样，他们是真正陷于孤立，而且要一直孤立下去。当然，人民必须同他们进行针锋相对的斗争。”
    文章说：“我们生活在非常令人乐观的时代里，社会主义的胜利是肯定无疑的。毛泽东的伟大号召确实鼓舞着千百万人：‘全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。’”
