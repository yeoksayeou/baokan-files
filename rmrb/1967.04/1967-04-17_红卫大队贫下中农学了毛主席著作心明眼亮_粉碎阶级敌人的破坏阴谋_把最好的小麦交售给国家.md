The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Red Guards Brigade in the Red Guards Commune, Menglian County, Yunnan, have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, smashed the enemy's sabotage plans, and seized the opportunity to harvest wheat, delivering over 70,000 jin of wind-dried, clean, high-quality wheat to the state.

In January of this year, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party colluded with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the countryside to spread an economic wind of sabotage. The production of this brigade was also affected. Under the guidance of the local military propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants studied Chairman Mao's great directive on "grasp revolution, promote production" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country." They timely exposed the enemy's plots, launched a spring plowing production campaign, strengthened the field management of winter crops, and achieved a better harvest of winter crops this year compared to last year.

When the wheat ripened, the enemy, unwilling to accept defeat, incited the members to keep more wheat for themselves and deliver less to the state, attempting to sabotage the distribution. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, in response to the enemy's trick, combined the current criticism of the top capitalist-roader within the Party with the study of the "Three Old Articles" and other relevant instructions from Chairman Mao. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said: Without Chairman Mao's leadership, we poor and lower-middle peasants would have nothing. The top capitalist-roader within the Party wants to drag us back to the bitter life of the old society, but we firmly refuse. We poor and lower-middle peasants will follow Chairman Mao forever. Grain must first be delivered to the state. Some members, after studying the "Three Old Articles," said: Chairman Mao teaches us to be selfless and dedicated to others. We must not fall for the enemy's tricks. We must be like Zhang Side and Norman Bethune, selfless and dedicated to others, delivering the grain first to the state.

Through study, everyone exposed the enemy's plots and decided to deliver the best wheat to the state, supporting national construction with practical actions and smashing the enemy's sabotage. With boundless love for Chairman Mao, they carried Mao's portrait, waved red flags, and shouldered the best wheat, drumming and cheering their way to the grain bureau to deliver the first batch of patriotic grain since the criticism of the capitalist line of the reactionary bourgeoisie.

    红卫大队贫下中农学了毛主席著作心明眼亮
    粉碎阶级敌人的破坏阴谋
    把最好的小麦交售给国家
    新华社昆明十四日电  云南蒙自县红卫公社红卫大队各族贫下中农，活学活用毛主席著作，粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋破坏，抓紧时机收割小麦，并向国家交售了七万多斤风干、扬净的上好小麦。
    今年一月份，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派纠合农村地、富、反、坏、右分子，刮起了一股经济主义的妖风，这个生产大队的生产也受到了影响。广大贫下中农在当地驻军毛泽东思想宣传队的协助下，认真学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，及时识破阶级敌人的阴谋，掀起春耕生产热潮，加强了小春作物的田间管理，使得这个大队今年的小春作物获得了比去年更好的收成。
    当麦子成熟后，阶级敌人不甘心他们的失败，煽动社员多分麦子，少交售给国家，妄图在分配问题上进行破坏。广大贫下中农针对敌人的这一诡计，结合当前批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，学习了“老三篇”和毛主席的其他有关指示。许多贫下中农说：没有毛主席他老人家领导，就没有我们贫下中农的一切。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派想把我们再拉到旧社会去过苦日子，我们坚决不答应。我们贫下中农跟毛主席跟定了，粮食就是要首先交售给国家。有的社员在学习了“老三篇”后说：毛主席教导我们要毫不利己专门利人，我们不能上阶级敌人的当，要象张思德、白求恩那样，毫不利己专门利人，把粮食首先交售给国家。
    通过学习，大家识破了敌人的阴谋，表示要把最好的小麦交售给国家，以实际行动支援国家建设，粉碎阶级敌人的破坏。他们怀着对毛主席无限热爱的心情，抬着毛主席像，打着红旗，挑上最好的小麦，敲锣打鼓向粮食局交售了自批判资产阶级反动路线以来的第一批爱国粮。
