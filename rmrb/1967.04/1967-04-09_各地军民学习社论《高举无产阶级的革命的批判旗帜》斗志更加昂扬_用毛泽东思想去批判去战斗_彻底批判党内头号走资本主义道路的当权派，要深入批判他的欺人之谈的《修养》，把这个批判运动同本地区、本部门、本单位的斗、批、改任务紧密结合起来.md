Edition: 1

The editorial "Raise High the Banner of Revolutionary Criticism of the Proletariat" in the People's Daily has greatly boosted the fighting spirit of the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country who are launching a fierce offensive against the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party. They have declared that they will definitely raise the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly expose, criticize, and annihilate the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party and his poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation," further promote the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" to seize power, and advance the struggle to smash the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration tide, seizing new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao pointed out as early as last May: "Those in the Party, government, army, and various cultural circles who are in fact representatives of the bourgeoisie and are in fact agents of the bourgeoisie, are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize the power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of them have already been exposed by us, some have not been exposed yet, and some are still being trusted by us and are being groomed as our successors, such as the character of Khrushchev. They are now sleeping by our side. All levels of Party committees must pay full attention to this." The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people across the country say that Chairman Mao's extremely wise and great directive is our most powerful ideological weapon. We will definitely engrave Chairman Mao's great directive in our minds and implement it in action, thoroughly smashing the plot of the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party to restore capitalism, resolutely joining the mass criticism struggle, and thoroughly settling accounts with the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party over the past seventeen years, eliminating its poison in all fields, and letting the invincible and boundless Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, ensuring that the iron fortress of the proletarian dictatorship will never change color.

After studying the three articles in Red Flag magazine and the editorial in the People's Daily, the proletarian revolutionaries across the country have expressed that the current struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries is at a decisive stage. At this critical juncture, our criticism of the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party should focus on criticizing his bourgeois reactionary line on the cadre issue, criticizing the component of his reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number"; because the bourgeois reactionary line on the cadre issue has been greatly hindering the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and disrupting the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries. Many units that have won the struggle for power have used their personal experiences to discuss the importance of firmly implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line on the cadre issue, achieving the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and holding and using power well. The revolutionary cadres in these units have a deeper understanding. The revolutionary cadres of the Shanghai Food Company, which has implemented the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and established a revolutionary committee, said: The boundless Mao Zedong Thought has given us boundless courage and strength, exposed the tricks of the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party and the small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists he supports, and we stood up to rebel, united with the broad revolutionary masses to seize power. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! We are determined to raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism of the proletariat, thoroughly expose, criticize, and annihilate the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line he represents, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! The revolutionary youngsters of the preparatory committee for the great alliance of revolutionary Red Guards in colleges and universities in the Taiyuan region said: As early as last September, we used the method of class analysis taught by Chairman Mao to analyze the cadres, and we firmly acted according to the Sixteen Articles, believing that the vast majority of cadres at all levels are good or relatively good. We united with revolutionary cadres to revolutionize together. In the process of uniting, we learned a lot of political struggle experience from revolutionary cadres, and they also helped us greatly improve our organizational capabilities. However, the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party has been vigorously disrupting the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." We have seen through the tricks of the class enemy and given a powerful counterattack, firmly defending Chairman Mao's cadre policy and the correct policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The responsible person of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee said that we must firmly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, implement the policy of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient" for cadres who have made mistakes, and gradually unite more than 95% of the cadres. We will release the revolutionary cadres who have been persecuted and struck down by the bourgeois reactionary line and join us to follow our great leader Chairman Mao to make revolution.

The broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guard youngsters across the country believe that the criticism of the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party must be closely combined with the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own regions, departments, and units. The warriors of the New Beijing University Commune said that for seventeen years, there has been a struggle between two lines on the educational front, and our school is no exception. The Chinese Khrushchev has been protecting a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" in our school, vigorously promoting capitalist restoration, and suppressing the revolutionary masses from rebelling. Therefore, when we criticize the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party, we must closely combine it with the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our school, so as to eliminate the poison spread by the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party in our school and raise the level of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our school. The workers of the Jinan First Machine Tool Factory, members of the revolutionary committee of the factory, Yang Junfa and Sun Shubao, said: For many years, the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party has been supporting and protecting a group of ghosts and snakes, extending his claws into various fields. In 1958, he personally came to our factory for an "inspection" and spread a lot of poison. His revisionist poison has penetrated into many aspects of our factory's management, operation direction, and cadre line. We revolutionary workers will firmly raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly expose, criticize, and annihilate all revisionist black goods that go against Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and thoroughly eliminate all the poison spread by the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party. The revolutionary workers of the Guiyang Cotton Mill said that since the establishment of our factory, there has been a sharp struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. A small handful of capitalist-roaders in the factory, following the instructions of the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party, vigorously promoted profit-oriented, material incentive, and technology-first, making the factory chaotic and trying to pull the factory into the capitalist dead end. At that time, there were three big stones pressing on our workers, which were a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," and the revisionist "One Hundred Articles on Technical Management." The revolutionary workers said that we will firmly raise the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, encircle the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party, thoroughly expose and annihilate him and the small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" he supports, and throw their set of revisionist goods into the garbage dump.

The standing committee of the representative conference of poor and lower-middle peasants in Beijing today issued a call to action, urging all poor and lower-middle peasants in the city to take immediate action, raise high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and launch a fierce offensive against the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party, initiating a great mass movement of revolutionary criticism in the countryside. The call to action requires that this struggle be combined with the thorough settlement of accounts with the counter-revolutionary revisionist crimes of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, combined with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in one's own unit, and combined with promoting production while carrying out the revolution.

The proletarian revolutionaries and broad revolutionary masses across the country pointed out that the criticism of the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party must focus on deeply criticizing his deceptive talk of "Self-Cultivation," which is detached from the real class struggle, revolution, and political struggle. Li Daoming, a member of the standing committee of the revolutionary committee of the Qingdao Light Industry Bureau and former director of the Qingdao Light Industry Bureau, angrily denounced: I am an old Communist Party member. Due to the poison of "Self-Cultivation," I have long had serious slave mentality in my mind. Therefore, during the Cultural Revolution, I implemented the bourgeois reactionary line formulated by the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party in collusion with another major capitalist-roader in the Party, striking down the revolutionary masses. Now, I have awakened, and I have made a self-criticism to the masses. The masses have also completely forgiven me. From this profound lesson, I have a deeper understanding that this No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party is indeed a sinner, and he is the most dangerous enemy by our side. I will definitely join the broad revolutionary masses to thoroughly criticize the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" and resolutely expose and annihilate the Chinese Khrushchev. The revolutionary warriors of Taiyuan and Harbin expressed that they will definitely launch a mass criticism movement, criticizing "Self-Cultivation" deeply, thoroughly, and annihilating it. This mass criticism movement is a great struggle to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, carrying out the struggle of breaking private interests and establishing public interests in the mind. Through such a great criticism and struggle, we will definitely be better able to grasp and apply Mao Zedong Thought, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high. Many cadres across the country who were deceived and harmed by "Self-Cultivation" and made different degrees of mistakes have resolutely expressed that they will not be fooled by this book again, definitely raise high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and wholeheartedly join the hot struggle of the mass movement, testing, tempering, and transforming themselves in the struggle. They will definitely, through the thorough criticism of "Self-Cultivation," link it with their own thoughts, touch the depths of their souls, thoroughly break the bourgeois worldview, smash the spiritual shackles that the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party has put on them, thoroughly break with the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely fight to implement and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 8th, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who are vigorously launching a new great campaign with high fighting spirit, enthusiastically welcomed the publication of the editorial "Raise High the Banner of Revolutionary Criticism of the Proletariat" in the People's Daily. The cadres and soldiers unanimously pointed out that this editorial is another mobilization order to launch a general offensive against the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party, and it is the signal to march for a great criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev. The cadres and soldiers expressed that they will definitely raise the thousand-catty hammer, use the pen as a sword and spear, and join the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country to use Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful fighting weapon, to thoroughly expose and annihilate the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line he proposed in all aspects, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

From the vast barracks to the distant coastal and border defense lines, the barracks, airports, docks, and sentry posts are all battlefields for fiercely attacking the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party today. The cadres and soldiers repeatedly studied and discussed this editorial. The more they studied, the clearer they saw the immeasurable historical significance of this new great campaign, and the more ardent their revolutionary spirit became. The pilots of the "Air Force Heroes Squadron" guarding the southern gate of the motherland immediately held a criticism meeting to denounce the Chinese Khrushchev after hearing the broadcast. They excitedly said: To catch the ringleader, you must catch the ringleader. Once this Chinese revisionist mastermind is exposed, the small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party will definitely lose their backing, be at a loss, and definitely promote the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries, implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and greatly promote the victory of the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries; it will definitely raise the level of struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit. They expressed their determination to be the vanguard in raising high the banner of revolutionary criticism of the proletariat in this great campaign of general offensive. The cadres and soldiers of the former unit of the martyr of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Qiu Shaoyun, were excited after listening to the broadcast this morning, shouting in unison: This editorial is great! Deputy political instructor Liu Lianhao said: For a long time, the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party has been peddling revisionist goods, fiercely opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and attempting to restore capitalism, committing heinous crimes. This great campaign to bury this great conspirator is related to the fate and future of our country and the fate and future of the world revolution. Only by thoroughly fighting down, fighting over, and fighting to annihilate these capitalist-roaders in the Party and their mastermind can we ensure that China will never change color. The cadres and soldiers of this company unanimously expressed that they would raise high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the fearless spirit of Qiu Shaoyun in annihilating the enemy, thoroughly expose and annihilate this Chinese Khrushchev, and make him never be able to rise again!

The cadres and soldiers of the Shenyang, Beijing troops, and the stationed troops in Shanxi and Guizhou held various meetings and criticism meetings, focusing on criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line of the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party on the cadre issue. Many cadres and soldiers who are supporting the leftist broad masses and supporting the front lines of industry and agriculture have, in combination with the specific situation of the local area, angrily denounced and criticized the heinous crimes of the component of the bourgeois reactionary line "striking down a large number and protecting a small number." Zhang Daoben, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in a certain unit, said that I personally saw in the countryside how the small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party implemented the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number," causing serious consequences in the cadre issue. In the early stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they labeled a large number of revolutionary cadres as "black gangs" and "anti-Party elements," vigorously obstructing cadres from rebelling, causing a serious confrontation between cadres and the masses. This situation greatly hindered the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and disrupted the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries. We must thoroughly settle accounts with its poison together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, release a large number of cadres who have been persecuted and struck down by the bourgeois reactionary line, unite the majority, and severely strike down a small handful. The soldiers and officers of the engineering corps of the Jinan troops who are propagating Mao Zedong Thought in Beiguan People's Commune, Licheng County, Shandong, today studied the editorial in the People's Daily with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The five-good soldier Liu Qicai said: The focus of the struggle between the two lines is the question of which road China will take. Chairman Mao leads us to take the socialist road. The No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party, however, tries every means to pull us back to the old semi-feudal, semi-colonial road. In 1958, when Chairman Mao inspected here, he issued the great call of "It is still the people's commune that is good." The poor and lower-middle peasants here responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's call, established the people's commune, and relied on collective power to fight against nature, turning low-yielding fields into high-yielding fields. However, the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party vigorously opposed the people's commune and vigorously promoted "three selfs and one contract." The poor and lower-middle peasants here firmly took the road indicated by Chairman Mao and made the people's commune better and better. Now, it is time to settle accounts with the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party. We will definitely join the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to thoroughly expose and annihilate this Chinese Khrushchev.

Many cadres and soldiers in various units also deeply criticized the revisionist black program "Self-Cultivation" of the No. 1 capitalist-roader in the Party in their discussions. The combat hero Dong Xiaohai said, "Self-Cultivation" is the theoretical and ideological basis for the Chinese Khrushchev to implement the bourgeois reactionary line, which is anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. It attempts to make our revolutionary soldiers become detached from reality, detached from the masses, detached from politics, and detached from class struggle, becoming ordinary people and captives of the bourgeoisie. We must uproot this poisonous weed.

The broad cadres and soldiers pointed out that this great mass criticism movement is a revolutionary mass movement to break the bourgeois ideology and establish Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed that they would definitely take this criticism struggle as a great classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, pushing the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new high.

    各地军民学习社论《高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜》斗志更加昂扬
    用毛泽东思想去批判去战斗
    彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，要深入批判他的欺人之谈的《修养》，把这个批判运动同本地区、本部门、本单位的斗、批、改任务紧密结合起来
    据新华社八日讯　《人民日报》社论《高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜》，给正在对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起猛烈总攻击的各地亿万革命群众增添了巨大的战斗力量。他们表示，一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把党内这个赫鲁晓夫式的野心家、阴谋家和他的大毒草《修养》批倒、批深、批臭，进一步推动无产阶级革命派大联合实行革命的“三结合”的夺权斗争，推动粉碎资本主义反革命复辟逆流的斗争，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席早在去年五月就指出：混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。各地广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众说，毛主席的这一极其英明伟大的指示，是我们的无比强大的思想武器，我们一定把毛主席的这一伟大指示，刻在脑子里，落实到行动上，彻底粉碎党内头号走资本主义道路当权派复辟资本主义的阴谋，坚决投入群众性的批判斗争，全面、彻底地清算十七年来以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线，肃清它在各个领域里的流毒，让战无不胜的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，保证无产阶级专政的铁打江山永不变色。
    各地的无产阶级革命派学习《红旗》杂志的三篇文章和《人民日报》社论以后表示：当前无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争正处在决战阶段。在这个紧要关头，我们批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，就要着重批判他在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个反动路线的组成部分；因为在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，至今还在极大地妨碍革命的“三结合”，破坏无产阶级革命派大联合的夺权斗争。很多夺权斗争获得了胜利的单位，无产阶级革命派的战士们用切身的体会，畅谈了坚决贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，对实现革命的“三结合”和掌好权、用好权的重要意义。这些单位的革命干部体会更深。实现了革命的“三结合”并建立了革命委员会的上海食品公司广大革命干部说：光焰无际的毛泽东思想给了我们无限的勇气和力量，戳穿了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他支持的一小撮反革命修正主义分子的阴谋诡计，我们站起来造反，同广大革命群众一起联合起来夺权，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！我们决心高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线批倒、批深、批臭，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！太原地区大专中院校革命红卫兵大联合筹备处的革命小将说：早在去年九月份我们就用毛主席教导的阶级分析方法，对干部进行了分析，我们坚决按照十六条办事，相信各级干部绝大多数是好的和比较好的。我们同革命的干部结合起来一起革命。在结合中，我们从革命的干部身上学到不少政治斗争经验，同时他们也帮助我们大大提高了组织能力。但是，以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线，却竭力破坏革命的“三结合”，我们识破了阶级敌人的阴谋，给予有力的反击，坚决捍卫了毛主席的干部政策，捍卫了革命的“三结合”的正确方针。山东省革命委员会负责人说，我们要坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，对犯错误的干部要实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，逐步做到团结百分之九十五以上的干部。把那些受资产阶级反动路线迫害和打击的革命干部解放出来，和我们一道跟随我们伟大领袖毛主席闹革命。
    各地广大革命群众、革命干部和红卫兵小将们认为，批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，一定要同本地区、本部门、本单位的斗、批、改任务紧密结合起来。北京大学新北大公社的战士们说，十七年来教育战线上一直存在着两条道路的斗争，我们的学校也是如此。中国的赫鲁晓夫保护着我们学校里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，大搞资本主义复辟，压制革命群众起来革命。因此，我们在批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的时候，必须和本校的斗、批、改任务紧密结合起来，这样，才能肃清党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在我们学校散布的毒素，并使本校的斗、批、改提到更高的水平。济南第一机床厂工人、厂革命委员会常委杨俊法、孙树宝等说：多年来，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派扶持和保护了一批牛鬼蛇神，把他的魔爪伸进各个领域。一九五八年他亲自来我们厂“视察”，放了不少毒。他散布的修正主义毒素，渗透进我厂企业管理、经营方向、干部路线等许多方面。我们革命职工坚决高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把一切违背毛泽东思想、违背毛主席的革命路线的修正主义黑货，彻底批倒、批深、批臭，彻底肃清党内头号走资本主义道路当权派散布的一切流毒。贵阳棉纺厂的革命派职工说，我厂自建厂以来，一直存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐斗争，厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派秉承党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的旨意，大搞利润挂帅、物质刺激、技术第一，搞得乌烟瘴气，妄图把工厂拉向资本主义死胡同。当时压在我们工人身上有三块大石头，就是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、资产阶级反动技术“权威”和修正主义的“技术管理一百条”。革命派职工说，我们坚决奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，围剿党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，把他同他所扶持和保护的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、资产阶级反动技术“权威”彻底批倒批臭，把他们的一套修正主义货色统统扔进垃圾堆里去。
    北京市贫下中农代表会议常设委员会今天发出号召书，号召全市贫下中农紧急行动起来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派展开猛烈攻击，在农村掀起一个革命的大批判的群众运动。号召书要求，要把这场斗争和彻底清算旧北京市委反革命修正主义的滔天罪行结合起来，和本单位的斗、批、改结合起来，同抓革命促生产结合起来。
    各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众指出，批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，特别要深入批判他脱离现实阶级斗争、脱离革命、脱离政治斗争的欺人之谈的《修养》。青岛市轻工业局革命委员会常委、前青岛市轻工业局局长李道明愤怒地控诉说：我是一个老共产党员，由于中了《修养》的毒素，长期以来思想上存在着严重的奴隶主义，因此在文化大革命中，执行了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派勾结党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派制订的资产阶级反动路线，打击了革命群众。现在，我醒悟过来了，我向群众作了检查，群众也完全谅解了我。从这个深刻的教训中，我更体会到这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派真是罪恶滔天，他是我们身边最危险的敌人。我一定同广大革命群众一道，彻底批判大毒草《修养》，坚决把中国的赫鲁晓夫批倒批臭。太原、哈尔滨的无产阶级革命派战士表示，一定要掀起一个群众性批判运动，从理论上把《修养》批深批透批臭。这个群众性的批判运动是活学活用毛主席著作，在头脑里开展破私立公的伟大斗争。通过这样的大批判，大斗争，我们一定能更好地掌握和运用毛泽东思想，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新高潮。各地许多受《修养》蒙蔽、毒害而犯了不同程度错误的干部，坚决表示不再上这本书的当，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全身心地投入群众运动的火热斗争中去，在斗争中考验自己，锻炼自己，改造自己。一定要通过对《修养》的彻底批判，联系自己的思想，触及灵魂的深处，大破资产阶级世界观，粉碎党内头号走资本主义道路当权派套在自己身上的精神枷锁，彻底同资产阶级反动路线决裂，为执行和保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线而坚决战斗。
    据新华社八日讯　正以昂扬斗志投入新的伟大战役的人民解放军广大指战员，热烈欢呼《人民日报》社论《高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜》的发表。指战员们一致指出，这篇社论是向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的又一个动员令，是对中国的赫鲁晓夫展开大批判的进军号。指战员们表示，一定要奋起千钧棒，以笔作刀枪，同全国亿万革命群众一起，运用毛泽东思想这一最强大的战斗武器，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批臭，彻底肃清他所提出的资产阶级反动路线在各方面的流毒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    从广大营区到万里海防、边防线，营房、机场、码头、哨所，今天都是猛攻党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的战场。指战员们反复地学习讨论这篇社论，越学习对当前这场新的伟大战役的不可估量的历史意义看得越清楚，革命的斗志也越旺盛。守卫祖国南大门的空军某部“航空兵英雄中队”的飞行员们，听到广播立即举行了痛斥中国的赫鲁晓夫的批判会。他们激动地说：擒贼先擒王，把这个中国的修正主义的总后台揪出来，就必然使党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派失掉靠山，六神无主，就必然促进无产阶级革命派大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，大大促进无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利；就必然把各单位的斗、批、改提高到更高的水平。他们表示决心要在这场伟大战役的总攻击中，作高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜的闯将。前中国人民志愿军战斗英雄邱少云生前所在连队的指战员，今晨听广播后，群情振奋，齐声欢呼：这篇社论好得很！副指导员刘连高说：长期以来，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，大肆贩卖修正主义毒货，疯狂反对毛泽东思想，妄图复辟资本主义，罪恶滔天。这场埋葬这个大阴谋家的伟大战役，关系到我们国家的命运和前途，关系到世界革命的命运和前途。只有把这些党内走资本主义道路的当权派和他们的总后台彻底斗垮、斗倒、斗臭，才能保证中国永不变色。这个连的干部战士一致表示要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬邱少云消灭敌人那种大无畏精神，把这个中国的赫鲁晓夫批倒、斗臭，叫他永世不得翻身！
    沈阳、北京部队和山西、贵州等地驻军指战员，在各种集会、批判会上，着重批判了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线。许多正在支持左派广大群众、支援工业、支援农业第一线的干部、战士，纷纷结合当地具体情况，愤怒声讨和批判资产阶级反动路线的组成部分“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的滔天罪行。某部学习毛主席著作积极分子张道本说，我在农村亲眼看到党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派执行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，在干部问题上造成的恶果。在无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，他们把大批革命干部打成“黑帮”、“反党分子”，竭力阻挡干部起来革命，使干部和群众的关系严重对立。这种情况，极大地妨碍革命的“三结合”，破坏无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。我们一定要和贫下中农一起彻底清算它的流毒，把大批受资产阶级反动路线迫害和打击的干部解放出来，团结大多数，狠狠打击一小撮。正在山东历城县北园人民公社宣传毛泽东思想的济南部队工程兵某部指战员，今天和贫下中农一起，学习了《人民日报》社论。五好战士刘启才说：两条路线斗争的焦点，是中国走什么道路的问题。毛主席指引咱们走社会主义道路。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派却千方百计想把咱拉回到半封建半殖民地的老路上去。一九五八年毛主席视察这里时，发出了“还是人民公社好”的伟大号召。这里的贫下中农坚决响应毛主席的号召，办起了人民公社，依靠集体力量向大自然开战，把低产洼地变成了高产田。可是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，大肆反对人民公社，竭力鼓吹“三自一包”。这里的贫下中农坚决走毛主席指引的道路，把人民公社办得好上加好。现在，到了向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派算总帐的时候了，我们一定和广大贫下中农一起，把这个中国的赫鲁晓夫批倒、批臭。
    许多部队的指战员在座谈中还深入批判了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的修正主义黑纲领《修养》。战斗英雄董小海说，《修养》是中国的赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线的理论基础和思想基础，是反马克思列宁主义，反毛泽东思想的。它企图使我们革命战士变成脱离实际，脱离群众，脱离政治，脱离阶级斗争的庸人和资产阶级的俘虏，我们一定要把这株大毒草连根拔掉。
    广大指战员指出，这一场伟大的群众性的批判运动，是一场大破资产阶级思想、大立毛泽东思想的革命群众运动。他们表示，一定要把这个批判斗争当作活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，把活学活用毛主席著作推向一个新高潮。
