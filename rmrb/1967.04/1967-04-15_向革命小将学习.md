The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging forward with the force of a thousand thunderbolts and the momentum of a million horses.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the leaders of revolutionary organizations and the broad revolutionary masses have grown rapidly under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. They are bold and strategic, and have made great achievements for the revolutionary cause. I sincerely admire them from the bottom of my heart.

In the practice of revolutionary struggle, I have established a deep class sentiment with the revolutionary masses and the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations. I have come to feel more and more that the revolutionary youngsters are the future and hope of our country, and I have become more and more determined to learn from the revolutionary youngsters.

In the early stages of the movement, I had an insufficient understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In my thoughts and actions, I made mistakes to varying degrees. I did not see clearly the revolutionary direction of the revolutionary youngsters, and in my thoughts and feelings, I could not immediately turn around on some minor issues. Therefore, instead of taking an active and enthusiastic attitude to support them, I hesitated and watched from the sidelines. It was not until mid-February this year that, under the education of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the patient and sincere help of the revolutionary masses, I stood up and joined the revolutionary mass organization.

From the time I joined the revolutionary mass organization until now, because I have paid attention to using great Mao Zedong Thought to observe and measure everything, my thoughts and feelings have changed. Therefore, I have a new understanding and new insights into the revolutionary direction of the revolutionary masses and the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations. I deeply feel that from the day they began to fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, through a series of revolutionary struggles such as seizing power and holding power, their overall direction has always been correct. They have always stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, launching one attack after another against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, fighting bravely and fearlessly, fully demonstrating the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionary forces. They are indeed excellent! For the shortcomings that appeared in their revolutionary struggles due to a lack of experience in struggle, it is only a matter of one finger and nine fingers, and we should not cling to minor issues or put the cart before the horse.

The editorial of the fifth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine points out: "The broad revolutionary masses are the basis for the proletarian revolutionary forces to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and are the basis for the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' temporary power organs." In this extremely sharp and complex struggle, the broad revolutionary masses have elected completely reliable revolutionary organization leaders from among themselves. Therefore, in the current revolutionary 'three-in-one combination,' the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations are the concentrated representatives of the broad revolutionary masses. The attitude towards the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations is actually a question of the attitude towards the broad revolutionary masses. Since I joined the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' temporary power organ—the Revolutionary Committee of the Ninth Cotton Mill of Qingdao—I have further felt that the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, like them in the previous stage of the movement, play an extremely important role. It is not a question of whether to respect them, but rather that we must fully recognize that it is necessary for the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations to participate in order to truly reflect the revolutionary nature, representativeness, and proletarian authority of the temporary power organ, and to completely and thoroughly accomplish the glorious task given to us by Chairman Mao of "one fight, two struggles, and three changes." Otherwise, the revolution will be half-hearted. In a word, we must correctly treat the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations and the revolutionary masses, and highly recognize their great role in the revolutionary struggle. Only in this way can we do a good job of the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

In the two months since I joined the 'three-in-one combination' temporary power organ, fighting side by side with the revolutionary youngsters, I have learned a lot of good thoughts and good styles from them.

First of all, what is worth learning from the revolutionary youngsters is their revolutionary spirit of daring to break through various old frameworks. This is very precious. In dealing with problems, I often hesitate and am indecisive. But they are different; in revolutionary struggles, they dare to venture and innovate; in production struggles, they say they will do it and then do it. In mid-February, our mill was short of 200 tons of coal for the boilers, and there was a danger of the entire mill stopping production for two days. What to do? Just as I was hesitating, the leaders of the revolutionary mass organization and the revolutionary masses showed great decisiveness, resolutely deciding: "Production cannot stop for a single minute! The daily coal consumption of the boilers must be reduced from 115 tons to below 90 tons!" They took some corresponding effective measures, and as a result, the coal was quickly saved and controlled below 90 tons, ensuring the normal operation of the entire mill's production. This incident moved me greatly, and I thought: things that I did not even dare to think about, they have done it. The revolutionary youngsters really have a revolutionary spirit!

The revolutionary youngsters in the 'three-in-one combination' temporary power organ can best reflect the opinions of the broad masses and best connect with the masses. These revolutionary youngsters themselves come from among the masses and share the same thoughts and feelings with the broad masses. After they took power, they still maintained close contact with the broad masses. Zhang Xinqin, a worker from the fine spinning workshop, was elected as a member of the factory production committee after her election. She worked very seriously and responsibly, insisting on working with the workers and maintaining a harmonious relationship with the masses. The masses had problems and were willing to find her to solve them. This is a good education for me. Comrade Zhang Xinqin set a good example for me to learn from. Especially some time ago, I saw that the coal carriers' work was very heavy, but I was not emotionally moved. However, the leaders of the revolutionary mass organization, with deep class feelings for their class brothers, seriously suggested to me: "Old Li, we can't be like the power-holders taking the capitalist road and not care about the workers' pain!" After hearing these words, I always felt guilty, thinking: it has been 17 years since the founding of the nation, and under the control of a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, the factory is still run in a capitalist way, causing great losses to the Party and the people! And I am a Communist Party member and a deputy director, not always acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, betraying the trust of the Party and Chairman Mao. Thus, under the enlightenment and help of the revolutionary youngsters, I made up my mind to rely on the masses to solve the problem of coal transportation mechanization.

In the more than two months of being with the revolutionary youngsters, I feel that the revolutionary youngsters have a great advantage, which is to have a clear distinction between love and hate and to be the most daring in carrying out criticism and self-criticism. In the early days of participating in the 'three-in-one combination' temporary power organ, I still had some wrong ideas, fearing that if I said something wrong, I would be blamed, so I did not work boldly enough, especially on some issues related to the Cultural Revolution, I did not want to express my opinions. Aiming at this thought, they often had heart-to-heart talks with me, timely and seriously pointed out to me that I should not just focus on business, but should highlight politics and use politics to guide business. I should start from the interests of the Party and the revolution and boldly and actively put forward suggestions. They also discussed and studied with me in a timely manner. This moved me greatly. From then on, I gradually got rid of my private thoughts and worked more boldly. Later, when I put forward some active suggestions, they accepted and improved them with a sincere and humble attitude. This also educated me to learn from the revolutionary youngsters, listen to Chairman Mao's words, dare to carry out criticism and self-criticism, dare to insist on what is good for the people and correct what is wrong.

The most fundamental difference between me and the revolutionary youngsters is the difference in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of "daring to be beheaded and daring to pull the emperor off his horse," and through arduous and tortuous struggles, exposed the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and struck them down, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary forces. They resolutely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and carried out a thorough criticism of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. With the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they seized all the powers of the Party, government, economy, and culture that the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party had held. To overcome the non-proletarian thoughts in their minds, the day after they seized power, they followed Chairman Mao's instructions, took Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and carried out rectification studies. Through rectification, they unified their thoughts, achieved a revolutionary alliance of the revolutionary forces from the bottom up by administrative departments, and quickly established a revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' leading group. They also patiently and meticulously did ideological work on the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres who were deceived, so that the vast majority of the workers in the entire factory united around the Revolutionary Committee, fully and overfulfilled the national plan for the first quarter, and achieved a double victory in revolution and production. For all this, I have also deeply reflected: why can these leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, these young revolutionary youngsters, in the great storm of revolution, closely follow Chairman Mao, grasp the overall direction, and lead the broad revolutionary masses to advance victoriously? At the beginning, I only felt that they were young people who were fearless and dared to think and act. With the deepening of the movement and working with them to study and struggle together, I have come to realize more and more deeply that the reason why they can grasp the overall direction of the revolution in the great waves of revolution is that they can well study and apply Chairman Mao's works. These revolutionary youngsters, as early as the initial stage of the movement, took Chairman Mao's works as a guide and carried out a series of revolutionary struggles. They not only insisted on studying every day, doing it even if thunder strikes, using Chairman Mao's works to guide their daily work, but also used Chairman Mao's works to answer difficult questions in the struggle at any time. In comparison, I felt the great gap between us. The fundamental reason why I hesitated in my thoughts in the previous struggle was here. This made me deeply realize that only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and resolutely acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, constantly overcoming the "self" in my mind, can I grasp the direction of the struggle and keep up with the revolutionary ranks.

    向革命小将学习
    青岛国棉九厂革命委员会常委（原青岛国棉九厂副厂长）　李春霆
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，滚滚向前。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，革命组织负责人和广大革命群众，在毛泽东思想哺育下迅速成长起来。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢想、敢说、敢干，有勇有谋，为革命事业建立了丰功伟绩，我从心里对他们感到钦佩。
    在革命斗争实践中，我同革命群众和革命群众组织的负责人，建立了深厚的阶级感情，相互有了深刻的了解。我越来越体会到，革命小将是我们国家的未来和希望，越来越坚定了向革命小将学习的决心。
    运动初期，我对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义认识不足，在思想和行动上都犯有不同程度的错误，对革命小将的革命大方向看不清，对他们的某些枝节问题在思想感情上还一时转不过弯来。因此，不是抱着积极热情支持他们的态度，而是在他们的旁边徘徊、观望。直到今年二月中旬，我才在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的教育下，在革命群众的耐心、诚恳的帮助下，站了出来，参加了革命群众组织。
    从我参加革命群众组织一直到现在，由于自己注意用伟大的毛泽东思想来观察和衡量一切问题，思想感情发生了变化，因此对于革命群众和革命群众组织负责人的革命大方向，有了新的认识和新的理解。我深深地感到，他们从开始向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行斗争的那天起，所经过的夺权、掌权等一系列革命斗争，大方向始终是正确的。他们一直坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动一次又一次猛攻，勇敢战斗，毫无畏惧，充分表现了无产阶级革命派大无畏的革命精神，他们确实是好样的！对于他们在革命斗争中，由于缺乏斗争经验，出现的这样或那样的缺点，仅仅是一个指头和九个指头的问题，不能抓住枝节问题不放，不能本末倒置。
    《红旗》杂志第五期社论指出：“广大革命群众，是无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的基础，是革命的‘三结合’临时权力机构的基础。”广大革命群众在这场极其尖锐、复杂的斗争中，推选出了完全可以信赖的自己的革命组织负责人。因此，在当前革命的“三结合”中，革命群众组织负责人，就是广大革命群众的集中代表。对待革命群众组织负责人的态度，实际上是对待广大革命群众的态度问题。自从我参加了国棉九厂“三结合”临时权力机构——革命委员会以后，进一步体会到革命群众组织负责人如同他们在前段运动中一样，有着极其重要的作用。不是要不要尊重他们的问题，而是应该充分认识到，必须有革命群众组织负责人参加，才能真正地体现临时权力机构的革命性、代表性和无产阶级权威性，才能完全彻底地完成毛主席交给我们的一斗二批三改的光荣任务。否则，就要使革命半途而废。归根结底一句说：必须正确地对待革命群众组织负责人和革命群众，高度地认识他们在革命斗争中的重大作用。只有这样，才能搞好革命的“三结合”，才能将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    参加“三结合”临时权力机构的两个月来，同革命小将并肩战斗，我从革命小将身上学习了许多好思想、好作风。
    首先值得我学习的是革命小将的敢于冲破各种旧框框的革命造反精神。这是十分可贵的。自己在处理问题中，往往是顾前忧后，迟疑不决。而他们则不然，在革命斗争中，他们敢闯、敢创；在生产斗争中，他们说干就干。二月中旬，我们厂锅炉用煤缺二百吨，有造成全厂停产两天的危险。怎么办？正当我犹豫不决的时候，革命群众组织的负责人和革命群众表现得十分坚决，斩钉截铁地决定：“生产一分钟也不能停！”“锅炉的日耗煤量要从一百一十五吨降到九十吨以下！”他们采取了一些相应的有效措施，结果，煤很快节约下来，控制在九十吨以下，保证了全厂生产的正常进行。这件事使我很受感动，心想：自己连想都不敢想的事，他们竟然干了出来，革命小将真有一股子革命闯劲啊！
    “三结合”临时权力机构中的革命小将，最能正确地反映广大群众的意见，最能联系群众。这些革命小将本身就是来自群众之中，跟广大群众有共同的思想，共同的感情。他们在掌权以后，仍然同广大群众保持着密切的联系。细纱车间工人张新琴当选厂生产委员会的委员后，工作十分认真负责，坚持同工人一起劳动，同群众的关系十分融洽，群众有啥问题，都愿找她解决。这对自己是一个很好的教育。张新琴同志为我树立了一个很好的学习范例。特别是前些时候，我看到提煤工人劳动沉重，感情上没有什么触动，但革命群众组织的负责人却满怀对阶级弟兄的深厚阶级感情，严肃地向我提出建议：“老李，咱们不能象走资本主义道路当权派那样不关心工人的痛痒啊！”我听了这话后，心里一直感到内疚，心想：建国十七年了，在一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的把持下，还是用资本主义的方式办厂，给党和人民造成多大的损失啊！而自己是个共产党员，是副厂长，没有时刻按照毛主席的指示办事，辜负了党和毛主席的信任。于是，我在革命小将的启发帮助下，下定决心，依靠群众，解决运煤机械化问题。
    两个多月来，同革命小将在一起，我觉得革命小将有一个很大的优点，就是爱憎分明，最勇于开展批评和自我批评。在参加“三结合”临时权力机构的初期，自己还有一些错误的想法，怕话说错了受埋怨，因此工作起来不够大胆，特别是有关文化大革命方面的一些问题，不愿多发表意见。针对我这种思想，他们多次找我谈心，及时严肃地给我提出批评，诚恳地指出不应当光抓业务，应当突出政治，用政治来统帅业务，要从党的事业和革命利益出发，大胆积极地提意见。他们有事也及时和我商量，研究。这使我很受感动。从此，我逐步丢掉私心杂念，工作比较大胆放手了。之后，当自己提出了一些积极的建议时，他们又是以诚恳和虚心的态度接受和改进。这也教育了自己，应该学习革命小将，听毛主席的话，勇于开展批评和自我批评，勇于为人民的利益坚持好的，改正错的。
    我和革命小将千差万差，最根本的差距，就是差在活学活用毛主席著作上。
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，广大革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬了“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的革命造反精神，经过艰苦而曲折的斗争，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把他们打得威风扫地，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气。他们坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，对资产阶级反动路线进行了彻底的批判。他们以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把持下的一切党、政、财、文大权。为了克服头脑里的非无产阶级思想，夺权后的第二天，他们就遵照毛主席的教导，以毛泽东思想为武器，开展了整风学习。通过整风，统一了思想，实现了按行政部门的、自下而上的革命派大联合，迅速建立起革命的“三结合”领导班子。他们还细致而耐心地对受蒙蔽的革命群众和革命干部作思想工作，使全厂绝大多数职工团结在革命委员会的周围，全面超额完成了第一季度国家计划，取得了革命、生产双胜利。对待这一切，我也曾深深地思考过：为什么这些革命群众组织的负责人，这些年轻的革命小将，能够在革命的大风暴中，紧紧地跟上毛主席，掌握住大方向，带领广大革命群众乘胜前进呢？开始只是从感性上认为他们是青年人，天不怕，地不怕，敢想敢干。随着运动的深入发展，和在工作中与他们共同学习，共同斗争，愈来愈深刻地认识到，他们之所以能够在革命的大风大浪里把握革命的大方向，千条万条，最根本的一条是他们能很好地活学活用毛主席著作。这些革命小将早在运动初期，就以毛主席著作为指针，进行了一系列的革命斗争。他们不仅每天坚持学习，做到雷打不散，用毛主席著作指导每天的工作，而且随时随地用毛主席著作来解答斗争中的疑难问题。对比之下，就更感到自己差距之大了。前一段自己在思想斗争中之所以表现得迟疑不定，根本原因就在这里。这使我深刻地认识到，只有象他们那样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力活学活用毛主席著作，坚决按照毛主席的教导去做，不断地克服头脑里的“私”字，才能掌握住斗争的大方向，才能跟上革命的队伍。
    革命斗争的实践，最有力地说明了革命小将不愧是毛主席的好战士，不愧是无产阶级的革命闯将！他们永远是我学习的好榜样。
