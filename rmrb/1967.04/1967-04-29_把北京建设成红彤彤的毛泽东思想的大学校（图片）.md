The troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing have entered factories to enthusiastically propagate Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Together with the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, they have launched a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, vowing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the PLA stationed in Beijing are holding high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and carrying out ideological revolutionization. They are advancing bravely in the direction indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao!

The little Red Guards of Beijing, nurtured under the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, have boundless love, respect, and admiration for Chairman Mao. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will rebel against them, overthrow them, and ensure they never rise again!

Revolution relies on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The printing workers of Beijing, with the greatest political enthusiasm, are printing and binding the precious book loved by the revolutionary people—*Selected Works of Mao Zedong*.

In the struggle to criticize and fight against the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee that he supports, the broad revolutionary masses of workers in Beijing have high revolutionary enthusiasm and increased production vigor, with the production situation becoming better and better.

The army loves the people, and the people support the army. The soldiers and officers of the PLA stationed in Beijing, who have gone deep into the countryside, study Chairman Mao's quotations with the poor and lower-middle peasants, vowing to plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on every battlefield.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Beijing are determined to thoroughly eliminate the poison left by the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee that he supports in the countryside. They are seizing the revolution and promoting production with all their might, reporting good news to Chairman Mao with practical actions! (Photo by Yang Changzhong.
