	Over 60 million mu of spring fields in Shandong Province have been plowed and turned over by more than 90%, and sowing has begun everywhere. In the southern regions of Linyi, Jining, and Tai'an, people are busy sowing sorghum and millet; in the northern regions of Huimin, Dezhou, and the Jiaodong Peninsula, people are busy selecting seeds and repairing farm tools, preparing to start sowing.

	Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the spring production of the production brigades in various rural people's communes in Shandong this year is exceptionally good, presenting an unprecedented new situation. Large numbers of propaganda teams composed of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary cadres of the proletariat have gone deep into the fields, working together with the commune members to vigorously promote spring production. They are propagating Mao Zedong Thought among the commune members, propagating the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping revolution and promoting production" and "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," and propagating the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Class of All Rural People's Communes and All Levels of Cadres." This has greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members.

    山东六千多万亩春田开始播种
    山东省六千多万亩春田已经耕翻好百分之九十以上，普遍开始播种。南部临沂、济宁、泰安等地区，正在繁忙地播种高粱和谷子；北部惠民、德州和胶东半岛地区，正在忙着选种和修理农具，即将开始播种。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，今年山东各农村人民公社生产队的春季生产，搞得格外好，出现了从未有过的新气象。由人民解放军指战员和无产阶级革命派组成的大批毛泽东思想宣传队，纷纷深入田间，同社员一起大闹春耕生产，向社员大力宣传毛泽东思想，宣传伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的指示，宣传《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，极大地激发了广大社员的革命干劲。
