Chairman Ho Chi Minh commends Vietnamese People's Army Artillery Forces
Calls on all officers and soldiers to annihilate American aggressors and achieve greater victories

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 14th, it was reported by local newspapers on the 14th: Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote a letter on the 13th to all officers and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army Artillery Forces, representing the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Workers' Party and the government, to commend them for their tremendous achievements in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

	In his letter, Chairman Ho pointed out that the Vietnamese People's Army Artillery Forces have excellently carried forward the glorious tradition of fighting well and accurately, achieving new brilliant victories. They have damaged many American warships, sunk many patrol boats of the Americans and their lackeys, severely struck the enemy's artillery, and annihilated a large number of American aggressors.

	Chairman Ho called on all officers and soldiers of the artillery forces not to be complacent due to victories. They must learn from the heroic artillery forces of South Vietnam, continuously strengthen their "decision to fight to the end and win" resolve, enhance unity and cooperation, improve tactics and technology, and strike the enemy more accurately and powerfully to achieve more and greater victories.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, the Vietnamese "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" published editorials on the 11th, enthusiastically hailing the glorious victories recently achieved by the heroic Vietnamese People's Army Artillery Forces in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

	The Vietnamese People's Army Artillery Forces, on the night of March 20th and the morning of the 21st, launched a fierce artillery attack on the American aggressors' artillery base in the Yu Temple area of Yulin County, Quang Tri Province, annihilating more than a thousand American troops, destroying 17 cannons and 57 vehicles. In addition, in the counterattacks against American pirates, they achieved a great victory by damaging 14 American warships.

	The editorial of the "People's Daily" said that the victory of the artillery forces is the victory of the people's war. It shows that only by relying on the power of the people can any military branch annihilate the enemy and preserve and increase its own strength.

	The editorial of the "People's Army Daily" said that the Vietnamese military and people have warned the American aggressors with actual actions: no matter what tricks they play in the air, at sea, or on land, they will inevitably suffer the deserved punishment from the Vietnamese military and people.
