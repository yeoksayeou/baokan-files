The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 21 issued a statement emphasizing that the U.S. government's so-called "proposal to expand the demilitarized zone by ten miles on both the southern and northern sides" is aimed at covering up its crimes of escalating the war and is a means of its plot to permanently divide Vietnam. The Vietnamese Democratic Republic government firmly opposes and strongly condemns this deceptive proposal by the United States.

The statement said that it is the United States itself that has violated the regulations of the demilitarized zone and the temporary demarcation line. It has cut off the communication between the people on both sides of the temporary military demarcation line, illegally sent armed forces into the demilitarized zone, suppressed and persecuted the people south of the demilitarized zone, and provoked the people north of the demilitarized zone. Since July 1966, the United States has repeatedly dispatched B-52 bombers to bomb the demilitarized zone. It has conducted multiple large-scale "sweeps" in the areas south of the temporary military demarcation line, dropped chemical poisons on some villages north of the demilitarized zone, and carried out barbaric bombings. What is even more serious is that since mid-February 1967, the United States has blatantly used cannons to shell the demilitarized zone and the territory of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic north of the demilitarized zone from the south. Since April 1967, it has driven out the residents living in the demilitarized zone and its surrounding areas, plotting to turn this area into a "no-man's land."

The statement pointed out that currently, U.S. imperialism, in order to salvage its heavy defeat in South Vietnam during the 1966-1967 dry season, is frantically escalating the war and preparing to escalate the war even more severely in both North and South Vietnam. The U.S. proposal to expand the demilitarized zone by ten miles on each side is precisely a means to cover up its war escalation and, at the same time, establish a vast "no-man's land" to permanently divide Vietnam. The statement said that the U.S. government launched the war of aggression against Vietnam, the U.S. government must stop the aggression, the U.S. government must unconditionally stop the bombing of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic and all other war actions, must withdraw all U.S. troops and their mercenary forces from South Vietnam, must recognize the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and must allow the Vietnamese people to settle their own internal affairs.

### 越南外交部强烈谴责美国的狡诈建议  美帝想用扩大非军事区掩盖扩大战争

    越南外交部强烈谴责美国的狡诈建议
    美帝想用扩大非军事区掩盖扩大战争
    据新华社河内二十二日电  越南民主共和国外交部二十一日发表声明强调指出，美国政府提出所谓“非军事区南部和北部各扩大十英里”的“建议”，是为了掩盖它进行战争“升级”的罪行，是它阴谋长期分割越南的一种手段。越南民主共和国政府坚决反对和强烈谴责美国的这一狡诈的建议。
    声明说，正是美国自己破坏了非军事区和临时分界线的规定。它切断了临时军事分界线南北两地区人民的来往，非法向非军事区派遣武装力量，镇压和迫害非军事区南面人民，对非军事区北面人民进行挑衅。一九六六年七月以来，美国曾经多次出动B—52型轰炸机轰炸非军事区。它在临时军事分界线以南地区进行多次大规模“扫荡”，对非军事区北面一些乡村撒放化学毒药和进行野蛮的轰炸。更加严重的是，一九六七年二月中旬以来，美国竟明目张胆地接连使用大炮从非军事区以南炮轰非军事区和非军事区以北的越南民主共和国领土。一九六七年四月以来，它把居住在非军事区及其附近地区的居民赶出去，阴谋把这个地区变成“无人区”。
    声明指出，目前，美帝国主义为了挽救它一九六六——一九六七年旱季在越南南方遭到的惨重失败，正在疯狂地进行战争“升级”，并且准备在越南南北两方进行更加严重的战争“升级”。美国提出每一方在非军事区各扩大十英里的建议，正是为了掩盖它进行战争“升级”，同时建立一个广大的“无人区”以便长期分割越南的行动的一种手段。声明说，美国政府发动了侵略越南的战争，美国政府必须停止侵略，美国政府必须无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动，必须把美国军队及其帮凶军全部撤出越南南方，必须承认越南南方民族解放阵线，必须让越南人民自己解决自己的内部事务。
