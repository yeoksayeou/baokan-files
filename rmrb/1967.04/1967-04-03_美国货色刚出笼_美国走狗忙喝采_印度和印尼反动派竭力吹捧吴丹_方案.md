U.S. Goods Freshly Out of the Oven, U.S. Running Dogs Quickly Cheer
Indian and Indonesian Reactionaries Eagerly Praise the Bruntland "Plan"

According to a report from New China News Agency on the 31st: New Delhi News: After the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant threw out his so-called "three-point proposal" to use "peace talks" as a smokescreen to cover the U.S. war "escalation" in Vietnam, the Indian reactionary government rushed to cheer for the big conspiracy plan concocted by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and expressed its willingness to serve this big conspiracy.

After U.S. President Johnson and Secretary of State Rusk expressed their support and welcome for U Thant's "proposal" on the 28th, the Indian government also quickly followed the U.S. in cheering. On the 29th, on the same day that the South Vietnamese puppet regime expressed its agreement with U Thant's "proposal," the Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman also came out to loudly cheer for giving U Thant "full support," and guaranteed that the Indian government would do what it needed to do to help this "proposal" be realized.

Indian Foreign Minister Chagla also expressed on the 29th that the Indian government has "consistently supported" U Thant's "mission" on the Vietnam issue.

According to a report from New China News Agency on the 2nd: Jakarta News: The foreign minister of the right-wing military regime in Indonesia, Malik, openly expressed support on the 1st for the so-called "proposal" recently put forward by United Nations Secretary-General U Thant to cover up the U.S. imperialism's war "escalation" in Vietnam. Thus, the U.S. running dogs in Indonesia, the Indonesian reactionaries with blood on their hands, also joined the ranks of U.S. lackeys in Asia cheering for U Thant's "proposal."

Not long ago, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Bundy had visited Indonesia. Afterwards, Malik cheered for his U.S. master, advocating that the U.S. had so-called "sincerity" in peacefully resolving the Vietnam issue. Malik also expressed that the Indonesian reactionary regime was willing to serve the U.S.-Soviet collusion's Vietnam "peace talks" fraud.

    美国货色刚出笼　美国走狗忙喝采
    印度和印尼反动派竭力吹捧吴丹“方案”
    据新华社三十一日讯  新德里消息：在联合国秘书长吴丹抛出他的以“和谈”烟幕来掩护美国的战争“升级”的所谓解决越南战争问题的“三点建议”以后，印度反动政府赶忙出来为美帝苏修炮制的这个大阴谋计划大肆叫好，并且表示愿意为实现这个大阴谋效劳。
    在二十八日美国总统约翰逊和国务卿腊斯克表示支持和欢迎吴丹“建议”后，印度政府也紧跟美国摇旗呐喊。二十九日，在南越傀儡集团表示同意吴丹“建议”的同一天，印度外交部发言人也出来大肆叫喊要给予吴丹以“全力的支持”，并且保证印度政府要做它所需要做的事来帮助这个“建议”实现。
    印度外交部长查格拉在二十九日也表示印度政府是“始终支持”吴丹在越南问题上的“使命”的。
    据新华社二日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权的外交部长马利克，一日露骨地表示支持联合国秘书长吴丹最近为掩护美帝国主义在越南的战争“升级”而提出的所谓解决越南问题的“建议”。这样，美帝在印尼的走狗、双手沾满印尼人民鲜血的印尼反动派，也参与了美帝在亚洲的一些走卒为吴丹“建议”喝采的行列。
    不久以前，美国负责东亚和太平洋事务助理国务卿邦迪曾经到印尼活动。事后马利克替他的美国主子摇旗呐喊，宣扬美国在越南问题上有所谓“和平解决的诚意”。马利克还曾表示，印尼反动政权愿意替美苏合谋的越南“和谈”骗局效劳。
