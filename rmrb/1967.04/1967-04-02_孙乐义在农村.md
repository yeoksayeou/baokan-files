Sun Leyi, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, is determined to let Mao Zedong Thought take root in the countryside and to temper himself with Mao Zedong Thought. He says what he means and does what he says. In the vast countryside, he has written a new chapter of serving the people wholeheartedly with Mao Zedong Thought.

Sun Leyi, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works from the Jinan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, brought the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp revolution and promote production" to Yijingzhuang. On the first night in the countryside, he wrote in his diary: "Let Mao Zedong Thought take root in the countryside, and temper myself with Mao Zedong Thought. Fill my mind with the great goal of communism, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, forever be heart-to-heart with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life." Sun Leyi put his words into action. In the vast countryside, he wrote a new chapter of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people with Mao Zedong Thought.

	The lights in the night school are brighter

	One evening, in the night school for studying Chairman Mao's works in Yijingzhuang, several kerosene lamps lit up the entire room. People listened attentively as Sun Leyi gave a lecture on studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles." The more they listened, the clearer their minds became.

	The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Yijingzhuang had long ago established a night school for studying Chairman Mao's works, persistently reading Chairman Mao's books. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a group of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, like owls fearing the sun, were afraid of Mao Zedong Thought and tried to extinguish the lights of the night school for studying Chairman Mao's works. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants drove away this dark wind, and the lights in the night school shone even brighter. The first thing Sun Leyi did upon arriving in the village was to accept the invitation from the revolutionary masses to share his experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	Sun Leyi spoke with reason, and the community members listened intently, their bodies leaning forward, and the lamps in the room were lit even brighter. When Sun Leyi shared his thoughts on studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he said: "To 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serve the people, one must 'completely' and 'thoroughly' overcome selfishness. To 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serve the people, one must 'completely' and 'thoroughly' read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Currently, Chairman Mao calls on us to 'grasp revolution and promote production,' so we must take the lead and charge ahead." The room immediately became lively, and everyone eagerly shared their thoughts and expressed their resolve. Brigade leader Wang Zhaolian said: "Fish cannot live without water, melons cannot grow without vines, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We will do as Chairman Mao says. With Chairman Mao leading the way and the People's Liberation Army supporting us, no matter how great the difficulties, we will not be defeated." Wang Jiping added: "To listen to Chairman Mao's words, we must establish the idea of farming for revolution, produce more grain, and build a strong country, which is also a support for the world revolution." Sun Leyi, together with the revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants, reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on wholeheartedly serving the people and studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping revolution and promoting production" until deep into the night.

	The next day, as soon as it was dawn, Sun Leyi and everyone else picked up their hoes and pushed their carts, singing songs about production for revolution and revolution promoting production, and went up the mountain to greet the rising sun, working enthusiastically. In the evening, the cadres and community members gathered again to study Chairman Mao's works. From then on, every night, the lights in the night school for studying Chairman Mao's works in Yijingzhuang would shine brightly.

	Building the irrigation canal with the spirit of public service

	In the eastern fields of Yijingzhuang, red flags waved, and crowds surged, painting a picture of the surging revolutionary spirit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Sun Leyi, pushing the cart at the forefront, worked with the community members to dig canals and build dikes. Wherever the work was hard, he would lend a hand. The community members saw him with sweat dripping from his face and praised him, thumbs up.

	During the labor, Sun Leyi noticed that some teams, in a rush to complete the work, compromised on the quality of the dikes. He thought: This is a main irrigation canal for the eastern fields of Yijingzhuang, covering hundreds of mu of land, and its quality must be ensured. During a rest, he raised this issue for discussion. Some people thought that the spring plowing tasks were urgent, and it was better to quickly complete the dikes to get on with the team's work. Sun Leyi felt something was wrong and, together with everyone, studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people made everyone realize that without Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, production would go astray. Some said, Chairman Mao calls on us to "grasp revolution and promote production," to build socialism quickly, efficiently, and economically. We only care about personal interests and ignore the collective cause, which is the "self" at work. We must learn from Comrade Zhang Side and "completely" and "thoroughly" build a good water canal.

	Then, Sun Leyi said to everyone: To "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, we must overcome the "self," just like building this canal, we cannot mix in sand and gravel, which would be adding impurities to the revolution. We must use solid good soil to build a strong dike; we must arm our minds with great Mao Zedong Thought to serve the public wholeheartedly and temper ourselves to be stronger.

	Never forget to be thrifty and make revolution

	In the pig feed preparation shed, the feeder Wang Diankui struggled to pull the bellows, and the room was filled with smoke, making him cough. "Is it hard to burn?" Sun Leyi asked upon seeing this. The feeder, Old Wang, without looking up, said, "Ah! It's really labor-intensive and coal-wasting." Sun Leyi looked at the full circle of pigs and thought about how the stove was hard to burn, wasting coal and unable to cook the feed on time. He remembered Chairman Mao's teaching to "be thrifty and make revolution" and decided to help fix the stove. Old Wang looked up and saw an unfamiliar soldier, saying, "Comrade, you should rest. I've tried fixing it several times but failed." Sun Leyi smiled and said, "Let's give it a try!" He rolled up his sleeves and started working.

	Old Wang saw the stove heating up and the ashes piling up, fearing Sun Leyi might burn his hands or dirty his clothes, and quickly brought over gloves and an apron. Sun Leyi said, "No need, it's more convenient to work barehanded." He looked here and there, and soon found the problem with the stove. He immediately dismantled and rebuilt it. Old Wang watched from the side, thinking: The soldier is really skilled, he can do anything. Sun Leyi worked so hard that he forgot to eat. Old Wang advised him to eat first and then work. Sun Leyi said while working, "Work thoroughly, Chairman Mao calls on us to be thrifty and make revolution. Fixing the stove early saves coal, which is also a contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." He insisted on finishing the work and personally tested the stove for a while.

	Sun Leyi's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the public and never forgetting to be thrifty and make revolution deeply impressed the feeder Wang Diankui.

	Learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants

	Sun Leyi always thought that the poor and lower-middle peasants were his role models and paid attention to learning their good thoughts and styles. He saw that the poor peasant Zhang Shumin, despite suffering from back pain, worked a full day and still studied Chairman Mao's works, feeling that the poor and lower-middle peasants loved the great leader Chairman Mao so much, eagerly read Chairman Mao's books, and diligently worked and produced for the revolution. Compared to them, he really fell short.

	The poor and lower-middle peasants' enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works greatly inspired Sun Leyi. Therefore, during the day, he worked and studied Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants in the fields. In the evening, after the meeting, he returned to the dormitory, no matter how early or late, he would study Chairman Mao's works under the lamp. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, he used the "two rulers" of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to examine his work every day. One day, Zhang Chuanji, who worked with him, said with concern, "It's late, go to sleep. We can do it tomorrow." Sun Leyi said, "Old Zhang, the poor and lower-middle peasants said it well, if you don't study Chairman Mao's works for a moment, your heart feels empty! There is still a study task for tomorrow." Saying this, he continued to study.

	Sun Leyi in the countryside, every day like this, insistently and unremittingly studied Chairman Mao's works, and meticulously transformed his thoughts. He said: "I will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, in this great furnace of the countryside, strive to transform my thoughts, and strive to be 'a person of high moral character, a person of pure character, a person of virtue, a person free from vulgar interests, and a person beneficial to the people.'"

    孙乐义在农村
    学习毛主席著作积极分子孙乐义，立志要让毛泽东思想在农村扎根，也要用毛泽东思想熔炼自己。他说到做到。在农村的广阔天地里，他用毛泽东思想写下了为人民服务的新篇章。
    人民解放军济南部队学习毛主席著作积极分子孙乐义，带着伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，来到了尹格庄。到农村第一天晚上，他在日记上写道：“要让毛泽东思想在农村扎根，也要用毛泽东思想熔炼自己，脑子里装上共产主义大目标，肩上挑起革命、生产两副担子，永远和贫下中农心连心，一辈子跟着毛主席干革命。”孙乐义说到做到，他在农村这个广阔天地里，用毛泽东思想写下了“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的新篇章。夜校的灯光更亮了
    一天晚上，在尹格庄学习毛主席著作夜校里，几盏煤油灯照得满屋通亮。人们静心地听着孙乐义作学习“老三篇”辅导报告。大家越听心里越亮堂。
    尹格庄的贫下中农、革命干部很早就办起了学习毛主席著作夜校，坚持读毛主席的书。无产阶级文化大革命以来，一群地富反坏右分子象夜猫子怕太阳一样，害怕毛泽东思想，妄想吹灭学习毛主席著作夜校的灯光，但贫下中农打退了这股黑风，夜校的灯光更亮了。孙乐义进庄第一件事就是接受革命群众的邀请，给贫下中农谈学习毛主席著作的体会。
    孙乐义讲得句句在理，社员们个个听得入神，身子不断向前移，屋里的灯拨得更亮了。孙乐义介绍他学习《为人民服务》的体会时说：“要‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务，就要‘完全’‘彻底’斗倒私心。要‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务，就要‘完全’‘彻底’读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。眼下，毛主席叫咱们‘抓革命，促生产’，咱们就得一马当先打头阵。”屋子里立刻活跃起来，大家争先恐后谈感想，表决心。生产队长王兆连说：“鱼儿离不开水，瓜儿离不开秧，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。毛主席咋说咱咋办，有毛主席领路，有解放军撑腰，天大的困难也压不住咱。”王吉平接上说：“听毛主席的话就要树立为革命种田的思想，多生产粮食，把国家建设得好好的，也是对世界革命的一个支援。”孙乐义和革命干部、贫下中农一起，重温了毛主席全心全意为人民服务的教导，学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，直到深夜。
    第二天，天刚蒙蒙亮，孙乐义又和大家扛起镢头，推着车，唱着生产为革命，革命促生产的歌子上了山，迎着初升的朝阳，热火朝天地干起来。晚上，干部、社员又都聚集在一起学习毛主席著作。从此，每到夜晚，尹格庄学习毛主席著作夜校的灯光就亮起来了。用“公”字筑起排灌渠
    尹格庄的东大田里，红旗招展，人群如潮，一张张笑脸，一阵阵歌声，绘出了无产阶级文化大革命焕发出来冲天干劲的劳动景象。
    推着车子跑在最前面的孙乐义，和社员们一起挖渠筑堤。哪里活累他就在哪里插手。社员们看到他满脸挂着汗珠，都竖起大拇指啧啧称赞。
    孙乐义在劳动中，看到有的队为了图快，修堤质量不好。他想：这是一条凸出地面的引水排灌渠，是灌溉尹格庄东大田几百亩地的一条主要渠道，一定要保证工程质量。休息时，他把这个问题提出来，让大家讨论，有的人认为春耕生产任务紧，赶快修完了堤好干队里的活。孙乐义感到不对头，便和大家一起学习《为人民服务》。毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，使大家认识到，脑子里没有毛泽东思想挂帅，生产就会走到邪路上去。有的说，毛主席号召我们“抓革命，促生产”，多快好省地建设社会主义，我们只顾个人利益，不管集体大业，这是“私”字在作怪，我们要以张思德同志为榜样，“完全”“彻底”把水渠修好。
    接着，孙乐义对大家说：要“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，就要斗倒“私”字，就象修这条渠一样，不能掺稀泥，加松砂，掺进这些东西，就是给革命掺了假，要用坚坚实实的好土才能筑起牢固的大堤；要用伟大的毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，才能一心为公，把我们锻炼得更加坚强。不忘节约闹革命
    在饲养场煮猪饲料的棚子里，饲养员王殿奎吃力地拉着风箱，满屋子烟气腾腾，呛得他直咳嗽。“不好烧吗？”孙乐义看到后问了一句。饲养员老王头也不抬地说：“啊！真是费力费煤。”孙乐义看了看满圈的猪群，想到炉灶不好烧，既把煤浪费掉了，还不能按时煮熟饲料，就想起毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，他就动手帮助改炉灶。老王抬头看了看，是一个不认识的解放军同志，便说：“同志，你还是休息休息吧，我修了几次都没修好。”孙乐义笑着说：“试试看！”说着便挽起袖子干起来。
    老王见锅膛热，炉灰多，怕孙乐义烫了手，脏了衣服，赶忙找来手套和围裙。孙乐义说：“不用了，赤手摸起来方便。”只见他这看看，那摸摸，不一会便找出了炉灶不好烧的毛病，就马上拆了另砌，老王在一旁瞅着，心想：解放军同志真有能耐，什么事都能干。孙乐义干起活来，连吃饭都忘了。老王就劝他吃完饭再干。孙乐义边干边说：“干就干个彻底，毛主席号召咱要节约闹革命，早修好炉灶多节约煤，也是为无产阶级文化大革命多一份贡献啊。”他一直坚持干完，又亲自试烧了一会。
    孙乐义一心为公，不忘节约闹革命的精神，深深印在饲养员王殿奎的心里。向贫下中农学习
    孙乐义时刻想着贫下中农是自己学习的榜样，处处留心学习贫下中农的好思想、好作风。他看到贫农张树民患着腰痛病劳动一天还学习毛主席著作，感到贫下中农这样热爱伟大领袖毛主席，如饥似渴地读毛主席的书，勤奋地为革命积极生产劳动，和他们比起来自己确实差一大截子呢。
    贫下中农学习毛主席著作的革命热情，使孙乐义受到很大鼓舞。因此，他白天和贫下中农一起在地里劳动，一起学习毛主席著作。晚上开完会，回到宿舍后，不管早晚都要在灯下学习毛主席著作，按照毛主席的教导，用“完全”“彻底”为人民服务这“两把尺子”检查一天的工作。一天，和他一起工作的张传纪关切地说：“时间不早了，快睡吧，有事明天再搞。”孙乐义说：“老张，贫下中农说得好，一时不学习毛主席著作，心里空的慌啊！明天还有明天的学习任务呢。”说着又继续学习起来。
    孙乐义在农村，每天都是这样坚持不断地学习毛主席著作，一丝不苟地改造自己的思想。他说：“我要按照毛主席的教导，在农村这个大熔炉里，努力改造思想，争取做‘一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。’”
