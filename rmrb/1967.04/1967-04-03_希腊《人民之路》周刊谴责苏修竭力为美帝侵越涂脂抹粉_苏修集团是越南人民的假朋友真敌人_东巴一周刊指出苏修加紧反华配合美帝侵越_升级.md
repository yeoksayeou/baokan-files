	Greek "People's Road" Weekly Condemns Soviet Revisionists for Whitewashing U.S. Aggression in Vietnam
	The Soviet Revisionist Group Is a False Friend and True Enemy of the Vietnamese People
	East Pakistan Weekly Points Out Soviet Revisionists Intensify Anti-China Actions to Coordinate with U.S. Escalation in Vietnam

	New York, March 31 (Xinhua) - Athens: The Greek "People's Road" Weekly published an article on March 4 titled "Exposing the False Friends of the Vietnamese People and Actively Supporting the Vietnamese People to Carry Out Their Just Struggle to the End." The article condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership for colluding with U.S. imperialism and betraying the Vietnamese people's anti-American national liberation struggle.

	The article states: The armed forces of the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam have inflicted heavy blows on the U.S. aggressors and achieved one victory after another on the battlefield. Imperialists and revisionists are jointly exerting pressure on the Vietnamese people, attempting to force them to accept Johnson's "peace talks." On one hand, the U.S. aggressors have intensified their bombing, and on the other hand, the imperialists and revisionists' behind-the-scenes diplomatic activities have reached their peak.

	The article points out that the "peace talks" trick played by the revisionists is entirely in the service of Johnson's aggressive and extortionist policies, aiming to make the Vietnamese people surrender to the U.S. aggressors.

	The article condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership for trying to create the impression that it is not U.S. imperialism and its lackeys' aggressive and war policies that threaten world peace, but the stance of the Vietnamese people and the People's Republic of China. The article states: "This attack on the Vietnamese people and their struggle further clearly exposes the true position of the Soviet revisionist leadership on the Vietnamese issue."

	The article emphasizes that the Vietnamese issue can only be resolved on the basis of the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam and the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. That is, the U.S. and its puppet countries' troops must immediately withdraw from South Vietnam, allowing the Vietnamese people to rule their own country and solve their own problems. Any concession to this stance is a betrayal of the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle and directly serves U.S. imperialism.

	The article continues: "The People's Republic of China has consistently pointed out that the struggle of the Vietnamese people against the U.S. aggressors must be carried to the end. The 700 million people of China express their heartfelt and resolute support for the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation." "It is the People's Republic of China that first exposed the 'peace talks' conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism and firmly opposed this conspiracy."

	The article calls on the people of the world to actively support the Vietnamese people's just struggle. The article states: "To successfully complete this task, it is necessary to resolutely expose the deception and trickery of the false friends and true enemies of the Vietnamese people—modern revisionism."

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Rawalpindi, a recent issue of the East Pakistan "Holiday" Weekly published an article by Rashid Ahmad, which states: "In the past approximately six months, it has been observed that while Washington is 'gradually escalating' the Vietnam War, the Soviet ruling group is 'gradually escalating' its anti-China slander campaign. Both are intensifying their efforts."

	The article, after exposing the U.S. and Soviet revisionist leadership's sabotage of national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and their extensive anti-China activities, points out: Just as Washington is escalating the Vietnam War, the Soviet Union is increasingly collaborating with the U.S. They are promoting the Soviet-U.S. treaty on the peaceful use of outer space, cultural agreements, consular agreements, and the Soviet-U.S. 'prevention of nuclear proliferation,' among others.

    希腊《人民之路》周刊谴责苏修竭力为美帝侵越涂脂抹粉
    苏修集团是越南人民的假朋友真敌人
    东巴一周刊指出苏修加紧反华配合美帝侵越“升级”
    新华社三十一日讯雅典消息：希腊《人民之路》周刊三月四日发表题为《揭露越南人民的假朋友，积极支持越南人民将正义斗争进行到底》的文章，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团加紧勾结美帝国主义，出卖越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    文章说，越南（南方）解放武装力量给美国侵略者以沉重的打击，在战场上取得了一个又一个的新胜利。帝国主义者和修正主义者正在合伙向越南人民施加压力，企图迫使他们接受约翰逊的“和谈”努力。一方面美国侵略者加强了轰炸，另一方面是帝国主义和修正主义的幕后外交活动达到了顶点。
    文章指出，修正主义者玩弄的“和谈”花招，完全是为罪魁祸首约翰逊的侵略和讹诈政策服务的，是要越南人民在美国侵略者面前屈服。
    文章谴责苏联修正主义领导集团，竭力给人们制造这样一种印象，好象不是美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和战争政策威胁世界和平，而是越南人民和中华人民共和国的立场威胁世界和平。文章说，这种“对越南人民及其斗争的攻击，进一步清楚地暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团在越南问题上的真正立场”。
    文章强调指出，越南问题只能在越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明和越南民主共和国的四项主张的基础上解决。即美国及其仆从国家的军队立即滚出越南南方，让越南人民当家作主，自己解决自己的问题。对于这种立场的任何让步，都是对越南人民英勇斗争的背叛，都是直接为美帝国主义服务的。
    文章接着说：“人民中国一贯强调指出，必须把越南人民反对美国侵略者的斗争进行到底。中国七亿人民表示衷心地、坚决地支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争。”“正是中华人民共和国第一个出来揭露了美帝国主义和现代修正主义的‘和谈’阴谋，并坚决反对这种阴谋活动”。
    文章呼吁世界人民积极支持越南人民的正义斗争。文章说，“为了顺利地完成这一任务，必须坚决揭露越南人民的假朋友、真敌人——现代修正主义的阴谋欺骗活动。”
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第电　最近一期的东巴基斯坦《假日》周刊刊载的一篇署名拉希德·艾哈迈德的文章说，“在过去约六个月里，人们发现，一方面是华盛顿‘逐步升级’侵越战争，另一方面则是苏联统治集团‘逐步升级’反华谩骂运动。两者都在加紧进行。”
    文章在揭露了美国和苏联修正主义领导集团破坏亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲民族独立运动和大肆反华之后指出：正当华盛顿把侵越战争不断升级的时候，苏联却同美国日益加紧合作。它们大搞苏美关于和平利用外层空间条约、文化协定和领事协定以及苏美“防止核扩散”等。
