A great storm is brewing, sweeping across the sky. A mighty storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, originating from Beijing and the Huangpu River, surges forward, sweeping through the land. It heads towards an ordinary water town in the south of the Yangtze River—Hongjing Brigade of Shaxi Commune in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province.

This brigade, famous for its active study and application of the "Three Articles," has, in this great storm and wave, closely followed the great helmsman Chairman Mao, becoming a model in defending and upholding Mao Zedong Thought.

The air is thick with politics. Upon arriving in Hongjing, one is immediately struck by the intense political atmosphere. In the fields, at the edges of the land, on the mud-dredging boats, and in the farmers' homes, portraits of Chairman Mao and plaques with his quotations are everywhere. The men, women, and children of the village all carry red-bound copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," greeting the rising sun as they spread fertilizer and dredge mud. The entire village presents a scene of prosperity and vitality.

Here, revolutionary farmers, filled with passion, persistently study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the Cultural Revolution. They say, "One can go a day without food, but not a day without reading Chairman Mao's books." Reading Chairman Mao's books has become their primary need in life.

They remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The essence of Marxism-Leninism is summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' You must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

In the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary young and old stand united, fighting shoulder to shoulder. They bring their questions from the battlefront to Chairman Mao's works for guidance, time and time again.

In the first team, Guo Atao, a nationally renowned activist in studying Chairman Mao's works, can recite "In Memory of Norman Bethune" word for word, though she cannot read. She can write "Long Live Chairman Mao!" in neat characters. This revolutionary storm has tempered her even more. On the banks of the Hongjing River, there is a flower named after the sun—Sten Yuying, a disabled but red-hearted daughter of a poor peasant. Though bedridden, her heart is with the revolution. She writes in her diary: "The revolution brings Beijing closer, and rebellion makes Chairman Mao even dearer."

The Party Central Committee's letter to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of rural people's communes across the country is like a spring thunder, shaking the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing. The revolutionary masses are all overjoyed, spreading the news: Chairman Mao has issued another battle call. Revolutionary cadres, upon hearing the good news, are so excited that their hearts are warm and their bodies are full of energy.

In the midst of the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, Hongjing Brigade has overturned old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. Things like ancestral halls, kitchen gods, martial arts novels, and the legend of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai have all been swept away and cleaned out. Now, when Hongjing farmers marry off their daughters, the brides do not ride in flowery sedan chairs but carry the "Three Articles." Even the old who once believed in gods and ghosts have, through Mao Zedong Thought, broken the "Four Olds" in their minds. The spiritual shackles that the exploiting classes had placed on the poor and lower-middle peasants for thousands of years have been shattered.

The great Mao Zedong Thought and the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have brought about a profound change in the spiritual world of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing.

Defending Mao Zedong Thought

"Every new thing in its growth encounters twists and turns." The new stage of the peasant masses directly grasping Mao Zedong Thought in Hongjing is not smooth sailing. The red flag is raised and flown in struggle.

Actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, turning the countryside into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, is something the class enemies hate and fear. They use every means to suppress and sabotage this effort. A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the county committee are the vanguard of this suppression and sabotage.

They slander Hongjing: "Studying Chairman Mao's works is good, but the yield is not high." They ridicule Hongjing: "The activists are either disabled or old, what cultivating power do they have?"

The class enemies dare to sabotage the peasant masses' study of Chairman Mao's works in Hongjing. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Hongjing will never agree to this. They launched a fierce battle to defend Mao Zedong Thought.

Guo Atao, this old poor peasant who actively studies Chairman Mao's works, burns with indignation facing the treacherous class enemies. Despite the harsh wind and snow, despite the late night and distant path, despite her frail age, she attends every meeting to criticize and struggle against the class enemies. She passionately vows from the bottom of her heart: "Whoever supports Chairman Mao, we will be close to them; whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will fight to the death with them."

When the "January Revolution" storm swept across Shanghai and the nation, Sten Yuying was in the hospital for treatment. How could she lie still? Chairman Mao's teachings echo in her ears day and night: "A Communist should be... with revolutionary interests as his first life." Her thoughts surge day and night: "Only by thinking of the revolution can one remain young forever. Even if one is paralyzed, one can still keep up with the wheel of history, rolling forward." She immediately returns to Hongjing and joins the revolutionary storm. She bravely leans on her pillow to write big-character posters, defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. On a cold winter night, amidst the swirling snow, Sten Yuying insists on attending the cultural revolution meeting. Her parents lovingly try to stop her. She says with great passion: "Everyone must die, but the meaning of death is different. To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai. Defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is defending the greatest interests of the people. Even if I die in the snow tonight, it is for the greatest interests of the people, and I will die a worthy death." As soon as she finishes speaking, she firmly asks her comrades to carry her chair and bravely faces the wind and snow!

The class struggle is fierce! A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party are restless. The landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are also restless. A landlord has been lying in bed "sick" for years. A few years ago, when the Kuomintang bandits attempted to invade the mainland, he got up to "see his illness." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this fellow got up to "see his illness" again. The revolutionary peasants see through his plot at a glance, search him, and indeed find his hidden account books from over a decade ago. A counter-revolutionary sees that more and more activists are studying Chairman Mao's works in Hongjing, and his teeth itch with hatred. He secretly sharpens his knife, planning to kill them. This knife was seized during the Cultural Revolution. Seeing the knife, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing understand even more: How can a poisonous snake turn into an eel? The enemy is indeed sharpening their knives! The enemy sharpens their knives, and we sharpen ours.

When the revolutionary masses of the proletarian revolutionary line seize power from the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party is exposed. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary peasants of Hongjing bravely join this great criticism movement.

They hear that the Khrushchev-like careerist sleeping beside us crazily opposes Mao Zedong Thought, crazily advocates the development of capitalism in the countryside, and crazily propagates the idealist cultivation theory, and their lungs burst with anger.

Listen! The militia captain Li Huicai is denouncing: For seventeen years, several gusts of cold wind have blown through the countryside. Now we know that the root cause is the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the landlord class, but they want to carry out a peaceful land reform. Chairman Mao guided us to organize cooperatives, but they shout that there are "too many" cooperatives. In the temporary difficulties of the three years of natural disasters, Chairman Mao led us to persist on the socialist road. They took the opportunity to fan the flames, advocating individual farming. They dare to oppose our red sun in our hearts, the poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we must settle the new and old accounts they owe!

Listen! The revolutionary young people Wen Zhongying, Sten Xuelin, and Huang Lijuan are denouncing: The number one capitalist-roader within the Party sings praises for the exploitative system, wanting to bring back the three knives of the old society—heavy rent, high taxes, and usurious interest rates—and put them on our backs. They want to bring back the three paths of the old society's poor—starvation, suicide, and imprisonment—and put them before us. In a word, they want to put the "three big mountains" back on our heads. We will never agree to this! We must definitely overthrow this most dangerous enemy, "Even if one is skinned alive, one dares to pull the emperor off his horse!"

Revolution in the Depths of the Soul

In the battle to defend Mao Zedong Thought, the Hongjing Brigade becomes stronger and stronger.

In the past two years, the revolutionary peasants of Hongjing Brigade have extensively studied the "Three Articles," extensively applied the "Three Articles," extensively overturned the "self," and extensively established the "public," carrying out a revolution in the depths of their souls. In this Cultural Revolution, they have raised the revolution in the depths of their souls to a new level.

"Work points," this was once the focal point of the struggle between public and private. The peasants of Hongjing have made their own comparisons: In the past, they would argue red-faced over three or five cents of work points; later, they would secretly do heavy work without leaving a name. In the past, going to work early was for work points; later, going to work early was for duty. What caused this change? It was because they had three people in their minds: learning from Zhang Zedong, selfishness is not allowed; learning from Norman Bethune, do not seek work points; learning from the old fool, charge forward when facing difficulties. The sixth team has a Su Huiliang, who, when assigned to cut grass, cuts hundreds of pounds a day. When asked to dredge mud, he does the work of two people. In the past, Su Huiliang was a different person, and if he did not get twenty work points a day, he would argue with the team leader. Later, he did not argue or struggle but worked hard. He said: After studying the "Three Articles," the target is different. In the past, working a day in the fields, the target was twenty points; later, he understood that even farmers should be "completely" and "thoroughly" for the people.

Not only Su Huiliang in the sixth team, but every team has a "Su Huiliang."

The eighth team has a poor peasant Chen Zhaoying, a retired worker from a silk factory, who did over a thousand work points last year and did not take a single one. When there is no farm work, she returns to the factory to work, and she does not take a single wage. Why does she not take work points or wages? She said she read Chairman Mao's books and understood that a person should live to be "completely" and "thoroughly" for the people. The state has already given me a retirement allowance, why do I need more money? One family being rich is not good, the collective and the state being rich is good, and the liberation of all the people of the world is truly good! She does not take work points or wages, but when she works, she works with all her might. After her own team's cotton is picked, she rushes to the thirteenth team. After the thirteenth team's cotton is picked, she rushes to the seventh team, the first team... She does not go near the factory for work. On the morning of the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth lunar month last year, the north wind howled, and the snow fell heavily. She stepped out of her home, not looking back, facing the wind and snow, and ran swiftly on the dikes!

The struggle between public and private deepens step by step, the position of Mao Zedong Thought in the mind expands step by step, and the spiritual world of the people becomes broader and broader. The peasants of Hongjing say: In the past, standing at the door, one would see the private plot, farming for survival; now, standing at the door, one sees Tiananmen Gate, looking towards the whole world, farming for the revolution.

The change in worldview has caused a series of chain reactions in the lives of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing. People, teams, individuals, and collectives are all undergoing changes. Every family has a story, and every team has an article.

Mother-in-law and daughter-in-law disputes, sister-in-law quarrels, husband and wife arguments, which have been considered unsolvable problems for many years, are rarely seen in Hongjing.

With "selflessness and altruism" in mind, the attitude towards the collective has also changed. In the past, Hongjing had a saying: "Whether it's a cat's head or a dog's head, as long as the work points are right." Later, the cadres did not arrange for night work, but when the farming season was tight, many people started working at midnight. They worked without work points, for what? The members themselves said: "There is no Norman Bethune in the heart, and even a great work point cannot be invited; there is Norman Bethune in the heart, and one is afraid of not exerting enough effort."

Revolution in the depths of the soul, casting away selfishness and taking a red heart, Hongjing's foundation is indeed solid! This foundation, in the great storm and wave, stands firm and is tempered even more solidly and greatly. Overturning the "self" and establishing the "public," now in Hongjing, it is no longer about overturning the small "self" of one person or one team and establishing the small "public" of one person or one team, but it is to further overturn the "self" in the mind and let the greatest "public" occupy the position in the depths of the soul. What is the greatest "public"? That is: loyalty to the interests of the proletariat, loyalty to the people's interests, loyalty to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Countless revolutionary pioneers have raised the revolution in the depths of their souls to this height.

Sten Xuelin, during the intense struggle, was so busy that she did not return home for days, nights, or even weeks. Her father asked her to help repair the house several times, and she told her father: The matters in front of and behind the house are family affairs, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a national affair. I must care about national affairs.

The fourteen-year-old young pioneer Sun Peiyu fearlessly posts big-character posters on her mother—the brigade committee member. Someone jokes with her: "Your mother gave birth to you and raised you, and you post big-character posters on her. If she does not give you food to eat, what will you do?" The young pioneer seriously replies: "Eating only relates to me, but posting big-character posters relates to the whole country. I cannot only care about my own food and not care about national affairs."

Wen Zhongying, this young poor peasant girl, was trusted by her class comrades from the beginning of the movement and was selected as the deputy head of the brigade cultural revolution, carrying a heavy burden. She did not dare to carry it at first, fearing that some members did not know how to write big-character posters, making the movement difficult; secondly, fearing that she was trained by the brigade committee and led the way to raise opinions, the cadres nodded in front but wove cocoons in their stomachs, how could that be? Thirdly, fearing that if she became a cultural revolution leader, she might do something wrong, say something wrong, and the revolutionaries would revolt against her, which would be terrible? Thinking left and right, the ideological struggle was intense. She sought guidance from Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Many people are irresponsible in their work, picking the light and fearing the heavy, pushing the heavy burdens onto others, and picking the light ones for themselves..." She deeply realized that it was wrong not to dare to carry heavy burdens in daily life, and it is even more wrong not to dare to carry heavy burdens now. Facing the great enemy, how can one be frightened by the word "difficult"? How can one use "personal feelings" to replace class feelings? How can one be afraid of revolting against oneself? She made up her mind to sweep away the "self" and strive to carry heavy burdens. Wen Zhongying's "public" in her mind has become bigger and bigger.

Loyalty to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line

Forever loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! This is the sincere vow of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing. In the great storm and wave, they closely follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao. Whatever Chairman Mao says, they do; wherever Chairman Mao points, they go.

The revolutionary masses of Hongjing deeply feel that only by following Chairman Mao can they correctly treat the cadres; the revolutionary cadres deeply feel that only by following Chairman Mao can they go among the masses and correctly treat the masses.

The revolutionary masses of Hongjing are strict with the cadres, strict in ideology, not in persecuting people. This strictness is so good!

Zhou Zhaoqing, an old mother, is usually very kind to people. This time, she wrote big-character posters all night: "The brigade party branch secretary lives in our small team, why doesn't he often participate in the small team's meetings, and we can't see him for ten days or half a month?" But when someone criticized the production team cadres too much, this sixty-two-year-old old poor peasant immediately stood up and said: "The two types of contradictions must be distinguished!"

The revolutionary cadres of Hongjing even more deeply feel the need to express their hearts: "In this great storm of the mass movement, we can advance a step in the direction of serving the people, thanks to Chairman Mao pointing the way!"

The brigade party branch secretary Yang Mingsheng has been a cadre for over a decade. When the rural cultural revolution just began, he thought: The socialist education movement has only been over for a year, mistakes have been rectified, and shortcomings have been changed. This movement has nothing to do with me. Who would have thought that the sudden storm would bring out big-character posters one after another. Yang Mingsheng could not understand. He thought: I have been a cadre for over a decade, getting up at dawn and sleeping at midnight, with no merit, at least with hard work. How come now I am "cannonaded" and "burned"? It is like wearing a stone millstone to perform, with effort but no reward.

Yang Mingsheng thought more and more, and he could not sleep. Suddenly, his eyes fell on the portrait of Chairman Mao and the couplet hanging in the room: Chairman Mao wearing a Red Guard armband, waving and smiling; the couplet reads, "Listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow the Communist Party." Looking and looking, Yang Mingsheng thought in his heart: "Chairman Mao, in order to prevent the country from changing color, sees the Red Guard young pioneers daring to act and daring to do, and is very happy. I, although I have read Chairman Mao's quotations: 'You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses...', have not done it, but instead have emotions towards the masses' opinions. Can this be called listening to Chairman Mao's words?"

Yang Mingsheng's ears rang with Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings: "Countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every one of us who is alive think of them and feel sad in our hearts. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any errors that we cannot abandon?" His heart became bright: "Rather than today, for the prevention of revisionism, admit mistakes and bow down in front of class brothers, than sit and watch the country change color!"

Yang Mingsheng stood up straight!

Standing up straight, there are many like him.

The brigade leader Sun Xiaoguan said at the beginning of the movement: "Welcome to post big-character posters on me." Big-character posters really came, and Sun Xiaoguan carried a "fear" in his heart: "Will I be caught by the small braid when checking in public? This time, the face will be lost completely." He brought this up-and-down question to seek guidance from Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao pointed out to him: "Every day you say 'arouse the masses,' but when the masses arise, you are afraid to death, what is the difference between this and the story of Ye Gong and the dragon!" Fear and courage fight in Sun Xiaoguan's mind, is it fearing the masses or believing the masses? He again seeks guidance from Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao teaches him: "We must believe in the masses," and Chairman Mao also teaches him: "As long as we insist on what is good for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, this team will definitely prosper."

The great leader's teachings are like a bright lamp, illuminating his heart and also illuminating his path forward. Sun Xiaoguan resolutely stands up straight. He sincerely checks himself in front of the masses. As soon as the check is over, he says: "Everyone, please wait!" On the same meeting, Sun Xiaoguan immediately arranges for the spring plowing production.

The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Hongjing unite under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. The great Mao Zedong Thought has awakened the revolutionary peasants of Hongjing, advancing on the socialist road with big strides!

Clouds and water surge, thunder and lightning roar. The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has tested Hongjing and tempered Hongjing. The revolutionary peasants of Hongjing firmly believe in Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Mao Zedong Thought, making the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Hongjing Brigade will definitely become a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 毛泽东思想阳光照洪泾

专栏：

    毛泽东思想阳光照洪泾
    风烟滚滚来天半。
    好一场无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，从北京城里，从黄浦江上，倒海翻江，奔腾而来。她奔向一个普普通通的江南水乡——江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队。
    这个以活学活用“老三篇”著名的大队，在这场大风大浪中，紧紧跟着伟大的舵手毛主席，成为捍卫毛泽东思想，大立毛泽东思想的好榜样。
    政治空气浓浓的
    一到洪泾，就给人一个强烈的感觉：政治空气浓浓的。田间、地头，罱泥船上、农民屋里，到处挂着毛主席像和毛主席语录牌。村上的男女老少，人人身揣红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，迎着朝阳，送肥、罱泥。整个洪泾呈现出一派欣欣向荣的景象。
    这里，革命农民满怀激情，始终坚持在文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作。他们说：“饭可以一天不吃，毛主席的书不能一天不读。”读毛主席的书，已经成了他们生活的第一需要。
    他们牢记着毛主席的教导：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    在文化大革命中，革命的小将和老将，紧紧团结在一起，并肩战斗。他们带着战斗中的问题，一遍又一遍地向毛主席著作请教。
    在第一小队，全国闻名的学习毛主席著作积极分子顾阿桃能一字一句熟背《为人民服务》，她虽然不识字，但能端端正正写出“毛主席万岁！”这次革命的风暴，使她锻炼得更加坚强。洪泾河畔的向阳花——身残心红的贫农女儿沈玉英，人在病床，心向革命。她在日记上写下了：“革命方觉北京近，造反更知主席亲。”
    党中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信，象春雷一样，震动了洪泾贫下中农的心。革命群众个个喜气洋洋，奔走相告：毛主席又向我们发出了战斗号召。革命的干部，听到喜讯，激动得心里热呼呼的，浑身是劲。
    洪泾大队在轰轰烈烈的文化大革命中，造了旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的反。什么家堂、灶君、武侠小说、梁山伯与祝英台……，通通扫地出门，荡涤干净。如今洪泾农民嫁女儿，新娘不要花轿子，只带“老三篇”；信神信鬼的老人，靠了毛泽东思想，也大破头脑里的“四旧”。几千年来剥削阶级套在贫下中农身上的精神枷锁被砸开了。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，使洪泾贫下中农的精神世界发生了深刻变化。
    保卫毛泽东思想
    “任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。”农民群众直接掌握毛泽东思想的崭新阶段在洪泾出现，并不是一帆风顺的。红旗是在斗争里树起，在斗争里飘扬的。
    活学活用毛主席著作，把农村变成毛泽东思想的大学校，阶级敌人又恨、又怕，千方百计进行压制和破坏。县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就是进行这种压制和破坏活动的急先锋。
    他们诬蔑洪泾：“学习毛主席著作倒是好，就是产量不大高。”他们奚落洪泾：“积极分子残的残，老的老，有什么培养劲道？”
    敌人胆敢这样恶毒地破坏洪泾群众学习毛主席著作，洪泾的贫下中农和革命干部一万个不答应。他们展开了保卫毛泽东思想的激烈战斗。
    顾阿桃，这个积极学习毛主席著作的老贫农，面对着阴险的阶级敌人，心里燃起了熊熊怒火。尽管风雪严寒，尽管夜深路远，尽管体弱年迈，凡是批判、斗争阶级敌人的会，顾阿桃每次都参加。她激动地从心底里发出誓言：“谁拥护毛主席，我们就和他亲，谁反对毛主席，我们就和他拚。”
    当上海“一月革命”风暴席卷全国时，沈玉英正在医院治疗。她哪里躺得住？毛主席的教导日夜在耳边响：“一个共产党员，应该是……以革命利益为第一生命。”她自己的思潮日夜翻腾：“一个人只有为革命着想，才能使自己永葆青春，即使是瘫痪了，也能使自己紧跟历史的巨轮，滚滚向前。”她立刻回到洪泾，投向革命风暴。她顽强地倚枕执笔，连夜写大字报，捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。严冬之夜，风雪弥漫，沈玉英坚决要去参加文化革命的会议。父母疼爱地拦住她。她满怀豪情地说：“人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重。捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就是捍卫人民最大的利益。我今夜就是在风雪中死了，也是为人民最大的利益而死，死得其所。”话音落处，她毅然请伙伴们抬起坐椅，迎风冒雪而去！
    阶级斗争是激烈的！党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派蠢蠢欲动。地、富、反、坏、右也蠢蠢欲动。一个地主，成年躺在床上“生病”。几年前，蒋匪帮妄图窜犯大陆时，他起来看过一次“病”。无产阶级文化大革命中，这家伙又起来“看病”了。革命的农民一眼看穿了他的阴谋，动手一搜，果然搜出他埋藏了十多年的变天帐。一个反革命分子，见洪泾学习毛主席著作的积极分子越来越多，恨得牙根都发痒。他暗暗磨快了砍刀，妄图杀害他们。这把刀在文化大革命中被抄了出来。一见砍刀，洪泾的贫下中农越发明白了：毒蛇怎能变黄鳝？敌人的确在磨刀！敌人磨刀，我们也磨刀。
    当无产阶级革命派大联合向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权斗争的关键时刻，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派被揪出来了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。洪泾的革命农民，奋勇地投入了这场大批判运动。
    他们听到睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫式的野心家，疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，疯狂地鼓吹发展农村的资本主义，疯狂地宣扬唯心主义的修养论，肺都气炸了。
    听！民兵营长李惠才在控诉：十七年来，农村里刮过几次阴风。现在我们晓得了，黑根子就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。毛主席领导我们推翻地主阶级，他们却要搞和平土改。毛主席指引我们组织起来，办合作社，他们却叫嚷合作社办得“太多”了。在三年自然灾害的暂时困难中，毛主席领导我们坚持走社会主义道路。他们却趁机煽风点火，鼓吹单干，他们胆敢这样反对我们心中最红最红的红太阳，用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农，一定要清算他们欠下的新帐和旧帐！
    听！革命小将闻忠英、沈雪林、黄丽娟在控诉：党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派为剥削制度大唱颂歌，就是要把旧社会的三把刀——租重、税多、利钱高，再砍到我们身上，把旧社会穷人的三条路——挨饿、上吊、坐监牢，再摆到我们面前。一句话，就是要把“三座大山”再压到我们头上来。我们一万个不答应！我们一定要把这个最危险的敌人打倒，“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”！
    灵魂深处闹革命
    洪泾大队在保卫毛泽东思想的战斗中，越战越强。
    洪泾大队的革命农民，这两年来，大学“老三篇”，大用“老三篇”，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，在灵魂深处闹革命。这次文化大革命中，他们又把灵魂深处的革命提高到一个新的水平。
    “工分”，这是过去公与私斗争的焦点。洪泾农民自己作过对比：从前为三厘五厘工分，争得面红耳赤；后来偷偷干重活，不留姓名。从前早出工是为争工分，后来早出工是为尽义务。这个变化靠了啥？就靠头脑里有了“三个人”：学习张思德，自私自利要不得；学习白求恩，不要争工分；学习老愚公，碰到困难向前冲。六队有个苏惠良，队里派他割草，他一天割上几百斤。要他罱泥，他一人顶两人。以前，苏惠良却是另一种人，一天得不到二十个工分，就要和队长吵。后来不争不吵劳动好。他说：学了“老三篇”，目标不同了。过去种一天田，目标是二十分；后来懂得了，种田人也要“完全”、“彻底”为人民。
    不仅六队一个苏惠良，队队都有“苏惠良”。
    八队有个贫农陈招英，是纱厂退休女工，去年工分做了一千多，一个也不要。农闲了，她回厂里去做工，她又一个工资也不要。她为什么不要工分不要钱？她说读了毛主席的书，想通了，一个人活着，就要“完全”、“彻底”为人民。国家已经给了我退休金，还要钱来做啥？一家富裕不算好，集体、国家富裕了才算好，全世界人民解放了才是真正好！她一不要工分，二不要工资，干起活来，却是拚死拚活。自己队里棉花摘好了，她又赶到十三队。十三队棉花也摘好了，她再赶到七队、一队……。她到工厂上工也不近。去年腊月二十五日清晨，北风呼啸，漫天大雪。她迈出家门，头也不回，迎风冒雪，在田岸上飞奔！
    公与私的斗争一步一步深入，头脑里的毛泽东思想阵地一步一步扩大，人的精神世界越来越宽阔。洪泾农民说：过去是站在家门口，看到自留地，种田为活命；现在是站在家门口，看到天安门，眼望全世界，种田为革命。
    世界观的改变，在洪泾贫下中农的生活领域中，引起了一系列的连锁反应。人与人，队与队，个人与集体，都在经历着变化。家家有故事，队队有文章。
    婆媳纠纷，妯娌不和，夫妻吵架，多少年来被认为是不可解决的难题。在洪泾，这种现象已经很难见到了。
    头脑里有了“毫不利己专门利人”八个字，对待集体也变了一个样。洪泾过去流行一句话：“不管猫头狗头，只要工分对头。”后来，干部不布置开夜工，可是农时一紧，许多人半夜就起来干活。干了没工分，为的啥？社员自己讲：“心里没有白求恩，天大工分请不到；心里有了白求恩，就怕自己出力少。”
    灵魂深处闹革命，丢掉私心换红心，洪泾这个根基打得实在是好啊！这根基，在大风大浪中，巍然不动，而且锤炼得更加扎实、更加高大了。破私立公，现在在洪泾，已经不是破一人一队的小私，立一人一队的小公，而是要进一步大造头脑里“私”字的反，让最大的公占领灵魂深处的阵地。什么是最大的公？那就是：忠于无产阶级的利益，忠于人民的利益，忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    多少个革命闯将，灵魂深处的革命，都上升到了这个高度。
    沈雪林，在斗争激烈的时候，忙得整日、整夜、甚至整个星期，不着家门。父亲几次要他帮忙修修房子，他告诉父亲：屋前屋后，是自家小事，无产阶级文化大革命，是国家大事。我要关心国家大事。
    十四岁的小将孙佩玉，毫不留情面地给她妈妈——大队支部委员贴大字报。别人跟她开玩笑：“你妈妈生你养你，你给她贴大字报，她若不给你饭吃，你怎么办？”小将一本正经地回答：“吃饭只关系到我一个人，贴大字报关系到整个国家。我不能只管个人吃饭，不管国家大事。”
    闻忠英，这个年青的贫农姑娘，运动一开始，阶级亲人信得过她，选她当大队文革副主任，让她挑重担。她开头不敢挑，一怕有些社员不识字，大字报写不来，运动难搞；二怕自己是大队支部培养起来的，带头提意见，干部当面点头，肚里做茧，怎么得了？三怕当了文革领导，难免做错件把事，说错句把话，人家造反造到自己头上来，岂不糟糕？左思右想，思想斗争很厉害。她向毛主席著作求教。毛主席指出：“不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。……”她深深觉悟到，平日不敢挑重担不对，现在不敢挑重担更不对。大敌当前，怎能被难字吓倒？怎能用“人情”代替阶级感情？怎能怕革自己的命？她下定决心，横扫“私”字，争挑重担。闻忠英头脑里的“公”字越来越大了。
    忠于毛主席的革命路线
    永远忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！这是洪泾贫下中农由衷的誓言。大风大浪中，他们紧跟伟大的舵手毛主席。毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做，毛主席指向哪里，他们就奔向哪里。
    洪泾的革命群众深深体会到，只有紧跟毛主席，才能正确地对待干部；革命干部深深体会到，只有紧跟毛主席，才能到群众里面去，正确地对待群众。
    洪泾的革命群众对干部是从严的，严在思想上，不在整人。这个严字是严得何等好啊！
    周招弟老妈妈，平日待人再慈祥不过。这一回，她连夜写大字报：“大队党支部书记，住在我们小队，为什么不常来参加小队的会，十天半月见不着面”？但是，当有人对生产队干部提意见过了头时，这个六十二岁的老贫农，立即站出来讲话：“两类矛盾要分清”！
    洪泾的革命干部，更加深有所感地掏出心里话来：“在这场群众运动的大风雨中，我们能够在为人民服务的航道上前进一步，多亏了毛主席指点方向”！
    大队党支部书记杨明生，当干部十多年了，这次农村文化大革命刚开始时，曾这样想：社教运动才过一年，错误检查了，缺点改掉了，这次运动，对我没啥。那里晓得暴风骤雨一起，大字报一张张贴出来。杨明生不能理解。他想：我当了十多年干部，起五更、睡半夜，没有功劳，也有苦劳。怎么到现在落得个“炮轰”、“火烧”？真是戴了石臼做戏，吃力不讨好。
    杨明生越想越不通。他翻来复去睡不着，忽然眼光落在房里贴着的毛主席像和对联上：毛主席佩着红卫兵袖章，招手微笑；对联写的是，听毛主席话、跟共产党走。看着看着，杨明生心里想：“毛主席为了使国家不变颜色，看到红卫兵小将敢闯敢干，十分高兴。我虽然读了毛主席语录：‘你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，……’却没有照着去做，反而对群众意见有情绪。这能算听毛主席的话？”
    杨明生耳边响起了毛主席亲切的教导：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”他心里豁然亮堂了：“宁愿今天为了防止修正主义，在阶级兄弟面前认错、低头，不能坐看国家变了颜色！”
    杨明生挺腰站起来了！
    挺腰站起来，大有人在。
    大队长孙小观，运动一开始就说：“欢迎贴我的大字报”。大字报真的来了，孙小观怀里揣起个“怕”字来：“当众检查，会不会被揪住小辫子？这一下，面子怕要丢完了”。他带着这七上八下的问题请教毛主席著作，毛主席向他指出：“嘴里天天说‘唤起民众’，民众起来了又害怕得要死，这和叶公好龙有什么两样！”
    怕字和敢字在孙小观脑子里打架，是害怕群众？还是相信群众？他又请教毛主席著作。毛主席教导他：“我们应当相信群众”，毛主席还教导他：“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”
    伟大领袖的教导象一盏明灯，照亮了他的心，也照亮了他前进的道路，孙小观毅然挺腰站起来。他踏踏实实地按照毛主席的指示办事，为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的。他在群众面前诚恳地做了检查。检查刚结束，他就招呼说：“大家且慢走！”就在同一个会上，孙小观抓紧布置了春耕生产。
    洪泾的革命群众和革命干部，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下团结起来了。伟大的毛泽东思想，唤起了洪泾的革命农民，在社会主义道路上大踏步前进！
    云水翻腾，风雷激荡。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，考验了洪泾，锻炼了洪泾。洪泾的革命农民坚信毛泽东思想，紧跟毛泽东思想，使毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，永远高高飘扬。经过无产阶级文化大革命，洪泾大队一定会成为一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
