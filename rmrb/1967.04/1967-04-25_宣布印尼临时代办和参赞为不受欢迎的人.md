The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Indonesian Chargé d'Affaires in China, Baren, in the afternoon of April 24. The representative of the Chinese government announced that Baren and the Counselor of the Indonesian Embassy in China, Sumarno, are unwelcome persons.

The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sternly pointed out: Due to the Indonesian government's continuous anti-China and anti-Chinese campaigns, which have seriously damaged the relations between the two countries, and due to the fact that Baren and Sumarno have engaged in various activities to sabotage the relations between the two countries during their tenure, the Chinese government has decided to declare them as unwelcome persons and to require them to leave Chinese territory by 24:00 on April 30.

The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs further pointed out: The Indonesian government has recently taken a series of outrageous anti-China and anti-Chinese measures. After sending a large number of military and police to surround the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and forcibly detaining the Chinese Consul General in Jakarta, Xu Ren, for eight hours on April 23, they have now, on April 24, unreasonably declared the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, Yao Denshan, and Consul General Xu Ren as "unwelcome persons." The Chinese government strongly condemns the Indonesian government's serious actions that have damaged the relations between the two countries and lodges the strongest and most serious protest.

    我外交部召见印尼驻华临时代办
    宣布印尼临时代办和参赞为不受欢迎的人
    严正指责他们进行破坏两国关系活动，限他们四月三十日前离开我国
    新华社二十四日讯　中国外交部负责人员二十四日下午召见印度尼西亚驻华大使馆临时代办巴伦，代表中国政府宣布巴伦和印尼驻华大使馆参赞苏玛尔诺为不受欢迎的人。
    外交部负责人员严正指出：由于印尼政府连续不断地掀起反华排华浪潮，严重地破坏两国关系，而巴伦代办与苏玛尔诺参赞在任职期间又进行种种破坏两国关系的活动，因此中国政府决定宣布他们为不受欢迎的人，并限于四月三十日二十四时以前离开中国国境。
    外交部负责人员接着指出：印尼政府最近采取一系列猖狂反华排华的措施，继四月二十三日派出大批军警包围中国驻印尼大使馆、武装劫持中国驻雅加达总领事徐仁扣留达八小时之后，竟然于四月二十四日无理宣布中国驻印尼大使馆临时代办姚登山和徐仁总领事为“不受欢迎的人”。中国政府对印尼政府这一严重破坏两国关系的行动，表示十分愤慨，并提出最严重和最强烈的抗议。
