	Thoroughly Eliminate the Poison of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line on Cadres
	Shanghai Wenhui Daily Editorial, April 12

	In all places, departments, and units that have implemented the bourgeois reactionary line on cadre issues, the approach has been to "attack a large group and protect a small clique." The situation in the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Fisheries is a clear example of this problem.

	The materials revealed from this bureau are shocking. "The Bureau of Fisheries has rotted away," "The Bureau of Fisheries needs to be burned down with a fire," under this "overthrow everything" mentality, the vast majority of cadres have been sidelined, and 60% of the personnel in the bureau have been "swept away," while a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the old Shanghai Municipal Committee have been "protected." The Cultural Revolution in the Bureau of Fisheries took a detour for a period. The situation in this unit, where a large group is attacked and a small clique is protected, is very similar to that at Tsinghua University. This is because both units have implemented the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the top capitalist-roaders within the party. Seeing these materials makes us even more hateful towards the bourgeois reactionary line and prompts us to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line on cadre issues and thoroughly eliminate its poison.

	The tactic of "attacking a large group and protecting a small clique" is extremely vicious. "The Bureau of Fisheries has rotted away," so the target of struggle naturally falls on the cadres and masses of this bureau: on the one hand, it incites the masses to struggle against the cadres, and on the other hand, it incites the cadres to struggle against the masses, stirring up the waters and pushing all the blame onto the lower levels, beating the cadres and revolutionary masses, while letting a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists off the hook, avoiding the fate of being overthrown.

	The large number of revolutionary cadres who have been persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line should direct their struggle firmly against this Chinese Khrushchev, against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, both big and small, and denounce their heinous crimes, and thoroughly settle accounts with them. Those cadres who consciously or unconsciously implemented this bourgeois reactionary line should also draw a clear line with the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party and completely break with the bourgeois reactionary line.

	History is merciless. Those who advocate "overthrowing everything" will ultimately be overthrown themselves. Those who suppress the revolutionary mass movement will meet a bad end. The top capitalist-roader within the party, playing with the two rings of "attacking a large group and protecting a small clique," tries to slip away, but the masses have been mobilized, and these two rings will definitely fall on him, burning off the false mask he wears on his "old revolutionary" face, exposing his fake revolutionary, counter-revolutionary, ugly face.

	The "Some Questions on the Current Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside" (the Twenty-three Articles) drafted by Chairman Mao personally points out that the majority of cadres are good or relatively good; efforts should be made to gradually unite more than 95% of the cadres; the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" should be implemented for cadres who make mistakes; the focus should be on striking down the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party. The Sixteen Articles drafted by Chairman Mao also embody this spirit. In criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line on cadre issues, we must firmly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy of "uniting the majority and striking down the minority."

	"Uniting the majority" will enable us to more effectively "strike down the minority." By thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line on cadre issues, we can liberate a large number of revolutionary cadres who have been persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line, unite revolutionary cadres with the revolutionary masses, launch a counterattack, and achieve an internal and external joint assault. The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, standing at the top of the pagoda, will be even more isolated, and their days will become more difficult. The day this small clique is completely isolated is the day they completely collapse.

	In the current mass criticism movement, if we grasp the principle of "uniting the majority and striking down the minority," we can protect a large number of good people, save a large number of comrades who have made serious mistakes, and strike down a small number of bad people. Doing so will eliminate the serious opposition between cadres and masses in some units and unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Doing so will greatly promote the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and greatly advance the struggle for power seizure by the revolutionary masses.

	Currently, in some units, the remnants of "attacking a large group and protecting a small clique" have not been completely eliminated, and some comrades have not consciously removed this remnant. This problem deserves our attention. The revolutionary masses should enthusiastically support the revolutionary cadres who have been persecuted and attacked to stand up and revolutionize, remove incorrect thoughts such as "not trusting, not reassuring, not satisfying," and fully and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

	Cadres who have been persecuted and attacked by the bourgeois reactionary line should immediately take action in this mass criticism movement, join the revolutionary masses, turn anger into strength, concentrate firepower, strike down the top capitalist-roader within the party, cut off his black hands reaching into various fields, and bravely join the battle. Now, some people are plotting, trying to sow discord between the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and pin the blame of "overthrowing everything" on the revolutionary youngsters and the revolutionary masses. We must not be fooled. Any resentment or grievance towards the revolutionary youngsters and the revolutionary masses is incorrect. Our slogan is to unite and fight. The furnace is burning red hot, and the war drums are beating loudly. Revolutionary cadres, the time is ripe, immediately join the battle!

### 彻底肃清在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线的流毒

    彻底肃清在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线的流毒
    上海《文汇报》四月十二日社论
    凡是在干部问题上执行资产阶级反动路线的地方、部门、单位，总是“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。上海市水产局机关的情况，也很说明这个问题。
    从这个局揭发出来的材料来看，是触目惊心的。“水产局烂掉了”，“水产局要放把天火来烧”，在这种“打倒一切”的思想指导下，绝大部分干部靠边站了，全局百分之六十的群众被“扫”了，而旧上海市委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，却得到了“保护”。上海市水产局的文化大革命运动，在一段时间内走了弯路。这个单位“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的情况，为什么与清华大学这样相象？因为这两个单位都贯彻了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线。看了这个材料，更促使我们痛恨资产阶级反动路线，起来彻底批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，彻底肃清它的流毒。
      “打击一大片，保护一小撮”，这一招是极其毒辣的。“水产局烂掉了”，于是，斗争的矛头，自然地指向了这个局的干部和群众：一方面挑动群众斗干部，一方面挑动干部斗群众，把水搅混，把一切罪责都推给下面，把板子都打在革命群众和革命干部身上，而把一小撮反革命修正主义分子放过去，避免被打倒的厄运。
    大批受资产阶级反动路线迫害的革命领导干部，应该把斗争矛头紧紧指向这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，指向党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路当权派，声讨他们的滔天罪行，并彻底清算这笔帐。那些自觉或不自觉地执行了这条资产阶级反动路线的干部，也应该和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界线，和资产阶级反动路线一刀两断。
    历史是无情的。主张“打倒一切”的人，最后自己终将被打倒。镇压革命群众运动的人，都没有好下场。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，玩弄“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这两个火圈，想乘机滑过去，但群众发动起来了，这两个火圈必定落在他头上，烧掉他那副套在“老革命”面孔上的假面具，而暴露出他的假革命、反革命的狰狞面目。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》（即二十三条）指出，大多数干部是好的和比较好的；要逐步做到团结百分之九十五以上的干部；对犯错误的干部要实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策；重点是打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条，也贯彻了这个精神。我们批判干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，就要坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，“团结大多数，打击一小撮”。
    “团结大多数”，就能更有力地“打击一小撮”。彻底批判了在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，把一大批受资产阶级反动路线迫害的革命干部解放出来，使革命干部和革命群众结合起来，大杀回马枪，来一个内外夹攻，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派站在宝塔尖上了，就更加孤立了，他们的日子越来越难过了。这一小撮人彻底孤立之日，即是他们完全垮台之时。
    在当前这场群众性的大批判运动中，我们掌握了“团结大多数，打击一小撮”的原则，就能保护一大批好人，挽救一大批犯有严重错误的同志，打倒一小撮坏人。这样做了，就能消除有些单位干部和群众的严重对立，在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下联合起来。这样做了，就能大大推进革命的“三结合”，大大地促进无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的进一步展开。
    目前，在有些单位里，“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的余毒尚未全部肃清，有些同志没有自觉地去清除这种余毒。这个问题值得引起我们的注意。无产阶级革命派应该热情地支持受迫害和受打击的革命干部站出来革命，去掉“不相信、不放心、不称心”等不正确的思想，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策。
    受资产阶级反动路线迫害和打击的干部，在当前这场群众性的大批判运动中，应该立即行动起来，和革命群众一起，化愤怒为力量，集中火力，打击党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，斩断其伸向各个领域的黑手，勇敢地投入战斗。现在，有人在耍阴谋，妄图挑拨无产阶级革命派和革命干部之间的团结，把“打倒一切”的罪名强加在革命小将和无产阶级革命派头上。我们不要上当。任何对革命小将和无产阶级革命派的埋怨情绪、委屈情绪，都是不正确的。我们的口号是联合起来战斗。炉火正烧得通红，战鼓在声声紧催。革命干部们，时不宜待，立即跃马上阵参战吧！
