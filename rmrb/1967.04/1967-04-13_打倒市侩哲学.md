	Overthrow the Philosophy of the Petty Bourgeois
	Huang Mei

	“Suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage” is a theory invented by the number one capitalist-road element within the Party.

	What is meant by “suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage”? Let’s use his own words to explain: “When dealing with people, one should be willing to suffer a small loss. When encountering difficulties, one should do what others are unwilling to do, work hard and bear hardships, and in the end, people will say you are a good person, and everyone will want to be friends with you, which will lead to great development in the future.” “In a socialist society, those who only think of personal interests will not achieve personal interests. Those who wholeheartedly serve the people will have personal interests; those who only think of one side will have both sides.” “Suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage is a law of development in the opposite direction.” …

	The number one capitalist-road element within the Party is a thorough and complete revisionist “theorist.” He thinks he is more clever than those barefaced bourgeois individualists. Look, he emphasizes the need to “bear insults and endure hardships,” to “yield and seek compromise,” to suffer a “small loss,” and to put on a show of “working hard and bearing hardships” … “Those who can bend and stretch are true heroes.” The number one capitalist-road element within the Party understands these tricks of scheming, and this is what sets him apart from the ordinary.

	However, no matter how beautiful the outer garment or how ingenious the methods, under the microscope of Mao Zedong Thought, all demons and ghosts cannot help but reveal their true forms. Peel off the surface of “suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage,” and you can see its essence. It turns out to be the same kind of thing as those barefaced bourgeois individualists.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “In terms of worldview, in modern times, there are basically only two kinds: the worldview of the proletariat and the worldview of the bourgeoisie. Either it is the worldview of the proletariat, or it is the worldview of the bourgeoisie.”

	“Suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage” belongs to which family? Naturally, it belongs to the bourgeoisie. Serving the public or serving oneself is the worldview of the two classes of proletariat and bourgeoisie. It is either one or the other, and there is no middle ground. Those who “suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage” use “serving the public” as a means and “serving oneself” as the goal. Serving the public is just a pretext. Their starting point is personal interest, and their endpoint is still personal interest. Such people are thorough and complete bourgeois individualists; such a philosophy of life is a genuine petty bourgeois philosophy.

	The so-called petty bourgeois philosophy is characterized by: adapting to the environment, acting according to circumstances; seeking profit, reaping a thousandfold. The number one capitalist-road element within the Party is best at promoting bourgeois individualism in a roundabout way, giving it various beautiful and legal “Marxist-Leninist” covers. Hanging a sheep’s head but selling dog meat, this is his method—the method of the petty bourgeois.

	The core issue of “suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage” is the word “self.” Such people can infiltrate the revolutionary ranks for personal gain and will, at critical moments, betray the revolution for personal gain. Such people can, for the sake of “gaining a big advantage,” “suffer a small loss” and put on a show of being revolutionary to deceive some people; but when they cannot “gain a big advantage,” they will tear off the thin veil of “suffering a small loss” and reveal their ugly selfish face. Didn’t the number one capitalist-road element within the Party, at the critical moment of the revolution, instruct his followers to surrender, betray the Party, betray the revolution, and betray the people? In their view, preserving one’s life is the most important thing. If one does not preserve one’s life, how can one even gain a “small advantage”? Isn’t that suffering a huge “loss”? For the sake of preserving one’s life, they throw away everything—revolutionary integrity, Party principles, and the interests of the people.

	Shameful! Detestable! The decay of the soul, the ugliness of the face, the shamelessness of the methods, and the baseness of the intentions are truly beyond description!

	The philosophy of “suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage” and the like is a corrosive agent that poisons people’s souls. If allowed to spread, it can only make people more and more revisionist, change the color of our country, and lead the people’s state back into the painful abyss of semi-feudal and semi-colonial times.

	“The golden monkey wields the thousand-pound rod.” Let us together denounce and expose the political swindler’s face of the number one capitalist-road element within the Party! Let us thoroughly criticize and condemn his petty bourgeois philosophy of deceiving people!

    打倒市侩哲学
    黄楣
    “吃小亏，占大便宜”，是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派“发明”的一种妙论。
    什么叫“吃小亏，占大便宜”呢？用他自己的话来作注解：“与人接触时，情愿吃点亏，遇到困难，人家不愿做的事我做，任劳任怨，最后人家说你是好人，大家愿意与你交朋友，将来还有大发展。”“社会主义条件下，一心一意为个人利益的人，是搞不到个人利益的。一心一意为人民服务，反而有个人利益；只顾一头，反而会有两头。”“吃点小亏，占大便宜，是相反方向发展的规律。”……
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，是一个彻头彻尾的修正主义的“理论家”。他自以为比那些赤裸裸的资产阶级个人主义者“高明”。你看，他强调要“忍辱负重”，要“委曲求全”，要吃点“小亏”，还装出一副“任劳任怨”的样子……。“能屈能伸者，是为大丈夫也。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，懂得这种钻营的技巧，这就是他不同“凡响”之处。
    然而，外衣尽管多么漂亮，手段尽管多么奥妙，在毛泽东思想的显微镜下，一切妖魔鬼怪都不能不现出它的原形。剥开“吃小亏，占大便宜”的表皮，就能看到它的本质，原来是和那些赤裸裸的资产阶级个人主义一样的货色。
    毛主席教导我们：“就世界观来说，在现代，基本上只有两家，就是无产阶级一家，资产阶级一家。或者是无产阶级的世界观，或者是资产阶级的世界观。”
    “吃小亏，占大便宜”属于哪一家？自然属于资产阶级一家。为公，为私，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的世界观。非此即彼，兼顾不得。“吃小亏，占大便宜”者，以“为公”为手段，以“为私”为目的。为公只是一个幌子罢了。他们的出发点是个人利益，落脚点还是个人利益。这样的人，是彻头彻尾的资产阶级个人主义者；这样的处世哲学，是地地道道的市侩哲学。
    所谓市侩哲学，其特点就是：适应环境，见机行事；唯利是图，一本万利。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派最善于转弯抹角地提倡资产阶级个人主义，给它披上种种“马列主义”的美丽、合法的外衣。挂的是羊头，卖的是狗肉，这就是他的手法——市侩的手法。
    “吃小亏，占大便宜”的核心问题就是一个“私”字。这样的人，可以为了个人利益钻到革命队伍中来，也会在关键时刻，为了个人利益而出卖革命。这样的人，平时可以为“占大便宜”而“吃点小亏”，装出一副革命的样子，迷惑一些人；但是，当“大便宜”占不到的时候，他就会撕下“吃小亏”的薄薄的面纱，露出他利己主义的丑恶面目。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派不是在革命的关键时刻，指使他的徒子徒孙们自首变节，叛变党、叛变革命、叛变人民吗？照他们看来，保命最要紧，不保住自己的命，岂不连“小便宜”也占不到，不就是吃了天大的“亏”吗？为了保命，什么革命的气节，什么党的原则，什么人民的利益，他们都统统丢在一边了。
    可耻！可恶！灵魂的腐朽，嘴脸的丑恶，手法的无耻，用心的卑鄙，真是无以复加的了！
    “吃小亏，占大便宜”之类的市侩哲学，是毒害人们灵魂的腐蚀剂。如果任其泛滥，只能使人们越养越修，使我们的国家变色，把人民的江山重新引回到半封建半殖民地的痛苦深渊里去。
    “金猴奋起千钧棒”。让我们一起口诛笔伐，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的那副政治骗子的嘴脸揭开来示众！把他那套欺人之谈的市侩哲学彻底批倒、批臭！
