Delegations from the revolutionary committees of Shanghai, Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and Shandong provinces and cities, who came to congratulate the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, visited Beijing University, Beijing Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Institute of Physical Education, Tsinghua University, and Beijing Geological Institute yesterday and today. They were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary teachers, students, staff, and Red Guards of these schools.

Revolutionary delegations from various provinces and cities and the revolutionary delegations from the capital exchanged experiences in revolutionary struggles. They unanimously agreed that the revolutionary factions of the proletariat across the country should unite more closely and raise the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher. They must criticize and expose the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, led by the number one capitalist-roader, and the reactionary bourgeois line he represents. They must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and not stop halfway.

The meetings between the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the capital's schools and the delegations from various provinces and cities were filled with deep revolutionary friendship. Some had fought side by side during the revolutionary tours, some had supported each other in the struggle against the fierce counterattack of the reactionary bourgeois line, and some, though previously unacquainted, were united by the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao. They read together with deep emotion Chairman Mao's quotations: "We are all from the five lakes and four seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together... Our cadres must care for every soldier, and all revolutionaries must care for, love, and help each other." They expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, learn from and support each other better in future struggles, and unite, fight, and win together in the revolutionary criticism movement against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party.

The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the capital's schools held welcome meetings and symposiums for the delegations from various provinces and cities, exchanging experiences in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on major issues. Many people, when introducing the struggle situation in their units, exposed the heinous crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and denounced the brutal persecution of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat by the reactionary bourgeois line. This aroused great hatred against the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. They raised their fists and shouted, "Down with the number one capitalist-roader in the Party!" The delegations said that whenever the revolutionary factions of the proletariat faced the most difficult times, people thought of the great leader Chairman Mao, and were filled with strength and courage. Every victory in the struggle was the result of Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership. People could not help but shout excitedly, "Long live the revolutionary line of the proletariat led by Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

At the welcome meeting and symposium at Beijing University, Vice-Chairman Chen Yonggui of the Shanxi Provincial Delegation and others introduced the experiences of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the promotion of production in various places. Vice-Chairman Nie Yuanzi of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and others also introduced the process of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat at Beijing University writing the first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. They emphasized in their speeches that although the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, the struggle has not ended. The revolutionary factions of the proletariat, amidst the cheers of victory, must remember Chairman Mao's instructions, "The enemy will not perish of itself" and "Never forget class struggle." They must not relax their vigilance, achieve a thorough victory in the struggle for power, and consolidate the power already seized, ensuring that the iron-clad mountains and rivers of the proletariat will never change color.

    五省市代表团访问首都大专院校受热烈欢迎
    无产阶级革命派欢聚一堂交流革命斗争经验
    新华社二十五日讯　前来祝贺北京市革命委员会成立的上海、山西、贵州、黑龙江、山东五省市的革命委员会代表团，今天和昨天分别访问了北京大学、北京工农兵体育学院、清华大学、北京地质学院等大专院校，受到了各校革命师生员工和红卫兵小将的热烈欢迎。各省市的无产阶级革命派代表和首都的无产阶级革命派在交流革命斗争经验时一致认为，全国无产阶级革命派要更紧密地团结起来，更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派以及以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线批倒批臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，绝不能半途而废。
    首都各校革命师生员工和各省市代表的会见，充满了革命的深情厚谊。他们有的是在革命大串连中就曾经并肩战斗过的战友，有的是在反击资产阶级反动路线猖狂反扑的斗争中互相支援过的革命伙伴，有的人虽然过去素不相识，但是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把大家的心紧紧地联系在一起。大家满怀深情地共同朗读毛主席语录：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”他们表示，一定要遵照毛主席的教导，在今后的斗争中更好地互相学习，互相支援，在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命的大批判运动中，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    首都各校革命师生都为各省市代表举行了欢迎会、座谈会等活动，围绕着当前无产阶级文化大革命中的重大问题，互相交流了斗争经验。许多人在介绍本单位的斗争情况时，揭露了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，控诉了资产阶级反动路线对无产阶级革命派的残酷迫害，激起了人们对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的无比仇恨，他们振臂高呼：“打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派！”代表们谈到，每当无产阶级革命派处在最困难的关头，人们一想到伟大的领袖毛主席，就浑身充满了力量和勇气，斗争的每一个胜利，都是伟大领袖毛主席英明领导的结果。人们禁不住激动地高呼：“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    在北京大学的欢迎会和座谈会上，山西省代表团副团长陈永贵等介绍了各地无产阶级文化大革命和抓革命促生产的经验，北京市革命委员会副主任聂元梓等也介绍了北京大学无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想指引下写出全国第一张马列主义大字报的经过。他们在发言中强调，现在无产阶级文化大革命虽然取得了伟大的胜利，但是斗争并没有结束，无产阶级革命派在一片胜利的欢呼声中，一定要牢记毛主席的“敌人是不会自行消灭的”和“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的亲切教导，一定要毫不松懈斗志，夺取夺权斗争的彻底胜利，并且巩固已经夺得的权力，让无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色。
