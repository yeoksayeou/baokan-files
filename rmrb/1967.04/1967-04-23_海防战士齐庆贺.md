Soldiers on the coastal defense front of a certain unit heard the joyous news of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee over the radio. They were all overjoyed and elated. They said, "In our hearts, the reddest sun, Chairman Mao, is in Beijing, and a revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' temporary power organ—the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee—has appeared. This is a great joy for the people of the capital! It is also a great joy for the people of the entire nation! Although we coastal defense soldiers are on the Yellow Sea coast, our hearts have already flown to the heart of the motherland. Our hearts beat in unison with the hearts of the people of Beijing."

The unit held a celebration banquet with local proletarian revolutionary cadres that night to enthusiastically celebrate the birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Everyone shouted loudly, "Learn from the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the capital! Criticize thoroughly the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party! Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

A soldier wrote a poem: "Beijing has achieved the 'three-in-one combination,' coastal defense soldiers celebrate together. The capital and the coast are connected at heart, soldiers follow Chairman Mao closely. Hold the rifle tightly to defend the coast, protect the great motherland, protect Beijing."

The sentry soldiers, with their guns on their backs, gathered in a circle before setting out on patrol. The officers and soldiers unanimously agreed that the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought that echoes through the clouds, and another great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Li Duofu, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said: The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the capital, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, wielded the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought to smash the old Beijing Municipal Committee, this den of revisionism, and exposed a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party who supported them from behind. This is a great and joyous event! Now, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the capital, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, have achieved the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary cadres and the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination,' establishing the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. A brand-new Beijing appears before the people of the entire nation. This is the wish of the people of Beijing! It is also the wish of us coastal defense soldiers and the people of the entire nation!

The officers and soldiers expressed their determination to learn from the proletarian revolutionary cadres of Beijing! They said: The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the capital, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have set many good examples for us and created many good experiences. Platoon leader Wang Yirong said, "We, the People's Liberation Army, are the people's army created by Chairman Mao. We will resolutely respond to the call of the great commander Chairman Mao, actively support the broad revolutionary leftist masses. We will not only resolutely carry out the eight orders issued by the Military Commission previously, but also resolutely carry out the ten orders issued by the Military Commission recently. No matter what storms we encounter, we will stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, closely unite with the broad masses of proletarian revolutionary cadres, fight together, and win together."

The coastal defense soldiers resolutely declared that they would respond to Chairman Mao's great call, seize the revolution, promote preparedness, promote work, and promote production. While completing the tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, they will heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and be ready at any time to annihilate the invading enemy.

    海防战士齐庆贺
    海防前哨某部战士们从广播里听到北京市革命委员会成立的喜讯时，个个欢欣鼓舞，兴高采烈。他们说：“在我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席所在的地方，出现了革命的‘三结合’的临时权力机构——北京市革命委员会。这是首都人民的大喜事！也是全国人民的大喜事！我们海防战士虽身在黄海边，但心早已飞到祖国的心脏。我们的心同北京人民的心一起在跳动。”这个部队连夜与当地无产阶级革命派举行庆祝晚会，热烈庆贺北京市革命委员会的诞生。大家放声高呼：“向首都的无产阶级革命派的战友们学习！”“彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”有一个战士写诗道：北京实现了“三结合”，海防战士齐庆贺。首都海疆心连心，战士紧跟毛主席。握紧枪杆守海防，保卫伟大祖国，保卫首都北京。
    哨所战士们背着枪，在出发巡逻以前，围坐一团，热烈地座谈。指战员们一致认为，北京市革命委员会的诞生是毛泽东思想又一支响彻云霄的凯歌，是毛主席革命路线的又一伟大胜利。学习毛主席著作积极分子李多福说：首都无产阶级革命派的战友们在无产阶级文化大革命中，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，打烂了旧北京市委这个修正主义的大黑窝，揪出了一小撮反革命修正主义分子和在背后支持他们的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，这是一件大快人心的大好事！现在首都的无产阶级革命派，又遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，实现了无产阶级革命派的大联合和革命的“三结合”，成立了北京市革命委员会。一个崭新的北京呈现在全国人民的眼前。这是北京市人民的愿望！也是我们海防战士和全国人民的愿望！
    指战员们表示，一定要向北京的无产阶级革命派学习！他们说：首都的无产阶级革命派，在无产阶级文化大革命中，为我们作出了许多好榜样，为我们创造了许多的好经验。排长王义荣说：“我们人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，我们坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席的号召，积极支持广大革命左派群众。既要坚决执行军委以前颁布的八条命令，又要坚决执行军委最近颁布的十条命令，不管遇到什么风浪，都要坚定不移地站在毛主席革命路线一边，紧紧地和无产阶级革命派广大革命群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”海防战士们坚决表示：一定要响应毛主席的伟大号召，抓革命，促战备，促工作，促生产。在完成好支左、支工、支农、军管、军训任务的同时，提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备消灭来犯敌人。
