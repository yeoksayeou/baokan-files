The editorial of *Red Flag* magazine and the article by Comrade Peng Zhen are excellent! They have thoroughly torn off the mask of the number one capitalist roader within the Party, exposing this Khrushchev-like great schemer to the light of day. They have sounded the charge for us, the working class, and the broad revolutionary masses, calling on us to raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought and to thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the number one capitalist roader within the Party!

This number one capitalist roader in China is not a "veteran revolutionary" at all, but a thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary! For decades, he has stubbornly stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, opposing our dearest and reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, and opposing the great Mao Zedong Thought. To restore capitalism in China, he has not only used every trick and scheme to block the forward march of history, but he has openly sided with the landlords and capitalists, shamelessly praising the exploiting classes and slandering our broad working class and laboring people. He is the sworn enemy of our working class, the sworn enemy of all laboring people!

This great traitor to the proletarian revolution, to restore capitalism in our country, has vigorously propagated the "progress" and "glory" of capitalism, shouting that "China does not have too much capitalism, but too little capitalism." This is sheer nonsense! We, the working class, will never forget the bitter suffering of capitalist exploitation in the old society. At that time, we shed blood and sweat, yet lived a life worse than cattle. Thanks to Chairman Mao leading us in revolution, we were liberated from the shackles of the capitalists and embarked on the happy road of socialism. Do you, the number one capitalist roader within the Party, want to drag us back to the sinful old society? Impossible! Forever impossible! We, the working class, will forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, building our great socialist motherland into an iron fortress of the proletariat that will never change color!

What kind of vine yields what kind of gourd, what class speaks for what class. This Chinese Khrushchev shamelessly spreads the fallacy of "exploitation is not a crime," shouting that "the laboring people do not oppose exploitation, but welcome it." He even fawns over the capitalists, saying, "Capitalist sir! I beg you to exploit me. If you exploit me, I will have food to eat, and my wife and children will be able to live. If you do not exploit me, it will be terrible." Pfft, shut up! Do not slander our working class and laboring people. Do not confuse right and wrong. Exploitation is a crime, rebellion is justified! Let the fallacy of "exploitation is not a crime" go to hell!

The number one capitalist roader within the Party has praised the bourgeois masters to the skies, but harbors deep hatred for our working class. He slanders us, saying we "do not understand politics" and "have low consciousness," and even says that capitalists fighting against workers is legitimate. What a spokesman for the capitalists! What politics do you understand? You understand bourgeois politics. What consciousness do you have? You have the ambition to restore capitalism.

We revolutionary workers resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, bravely joining this great struggle to thoroughly criticize the number one capitalist roader within the Party. All revolutionary workers in the city must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launch a magnificent mass movement of criticism! Sweep this Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen into the dustbin of history, creating a new world that is red with Mao Zedong Thought!

    把工人阶级的大叛徒扫进历史垃圾堆

    《红旗》杂志评论员的文章和戚本禹同志的文章好得很！它彻底撕掉了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的画皮，把这个赫鲁晓夫式的大野心家暴露于光天化日之下；它给我们工人阶级和广大革命群众吹响了冲锋号，号召我们高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判大旗，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派彻底批深、批透、批倒！
    这个中国头号走资本主义道路的当权派，根本不是什么“老革命”，而是一个地地道道的老反革命！几十年来，他一贯顽固地站在资产阶级反动立场上，反对我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，反对伟大的毛泽东思想。为了在中国复辟资本主义，他不但用尽各种阴谋诡计来阻挡历史车轮的前进，而且竟然公开地和地主资本家一个鼻孔出气，无耻地吹捧剥削阶级，污蔑我们广大的工人阶级和劳动人民。他是我们工人阶级的死对头，是一切劳动人民的死对头！
    这个无产阶级革命的大叛徒，为了在我国复辟资本主义，极力宣扬资本主义的“进步”和
  “光荣”，叫嚷什么：“中国不是资本主义太多了，而是资本主义太少了。”这简直是胡说八道！我们工人阶级永远也忘不了旧社会资本主义残酷剥削的痛苦，那时，我们流尽了血汗，却过着牛马不如的生活。多亏毛主席他老人家领导我们闹革命，把我们从资本家的桎梏下解放出来，走上了社会主义的幸福大道。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，你还想把我们拉回到罪恶深重的旧社会去吗？办不到！永远办不到！我们工人阶级要永远跟着毛主席闹革命，把我们伟大的社会主义祖国建成无产阶级的铁打江山，永不变色！
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。这个中国的赫鲁晓夫公然无耻地散布“剥削无罪”的谬论，大叫什么“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削。”甚至肉麻地向资本家献媚：“资本家先生！我请求你剥削一下吧，剥削我就有饭吃，老婆孩子就能活下去，如果不剥削，就不得了。”呸，住口！不准你污蔑我们工人阶级和劳动人民，不准你本末倒置颠倒黑白。剥削就是有罪，造反就是有理！让“剥削无罪”的谬论见鬼去吧！
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派把资产阶级老爷捧上了天，对我们工人阶级却充满着仇恨。他污蔑我们“不懂政治，觉悟不高”，还说什么资本家斗争工人是合法的，好个资本家的代言人！你懂什么政治？你懂的是资产阶级的政治。你有什么觉悟？你有的是资本主义复辟的野心。
    我们革命职工坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，勇敢地投入这场彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的伟大斗争。全市革命职工要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的批判运动！把这个中国的赫鲁晓夫连同他的娄罗，统统扫进历史的垃圾堆，创建一个毛泽东思想的红彤彤的新世界！
