In this great proletarian cultural revolution, the revolutionary youngsters have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to make revolution, and dare to rebel, and have created immortal feats and heroic deeds that have shocked the world.

At the beginning of the proletarian cultural revolution, I had long been confined by a set of frameworks and was always afraid of causing "chaos." However, the spirit of the revolutionary youngsters, who dare to speak, dare to act, dare to venture, dare to make revolution, and dare to rebel, has given me a profound education. They firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, using the microscope and mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to expose the true colors of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. No matter how senior or high-ranking these power-holders are, the revolutionary youngsters dare to knock them down and then stomp on them. I realized that the revolutionary direction of the youngsters is completely correct, and I decided to follow their example, daring to sacrifice myself and daring to pull the emperor off his throne. On June 20 of last year, I resolutely stood up and joined the revolutionary youngsters in fighting against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The revolutionary youngsters have always been loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. This has deeply moved me. A handful of power-holders within our school who are taking the capitalist road have waged a ruthless struggle against the revolutionary youngsters, striking them down mercilessly. They have used all their propaganda machines to call the revolutionary youngsters "hooligans" and "counter-revolutionaries." They have incited uninformed masses to attack the revolutionary youngsters. However, the revolutionary youngsters are fearless, full of confidence, and persist in their struggle. I resolutely learn from the revolutionary youngsters and stand with them. No matter how that handful of bad guys label me as an "active counter-revolutionary," even if they monitor and detain my child, forcing him to sever his relationship with me, I have not yielded.

The revolutionary youngsters' spirit of not fearing hardships and struggling tenaciously is also worth learning from. Chairman Mao teaches us: "This army has the spirit of daring to fight to the end. It will trample down all enemies and never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person left, that person must continue the fight." The revolutionary youngsters are doing just that. When a handful of power-holders within the Party impose a material blockade, and the revolutionary youngsters are in extremely difficult circumstances, they issued the slogan: "No car? We have legs. No loudspeaker? We have mouths. No food? We drink boiled water." They go without food but still carry out emergency tasks and still do morning exercises. After being ruthlessly struggled against, I lost my freedom. At that time, I thought: If I come out again, it will cause trouble for the revolutionary youngsters. Let them do it themselves! But the revolutionary spirit of the "Red East" youngsters educated me. I thought, I come from a family of three generations of hired laborers. At the age of thirteen, I started working for the landlord, herding cattle and carrying heavy loads, living like cattle and horses. In 1938, I joined the anti-Japanese struggle. It was Chairman Mao who guided me onto the revolutionary path. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no Li Gui. How could I forget my roots? To carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, I am willing to give my life for it. With the support of the "Red East" youngsters, breaking through countless difficulties, I continued to expose the crimes of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Later, I also organized some cadres and family members to join the revolutionary organization, winning over and uniting more masses to support the revolutionary youngsters, making the revolutionary ranks continuously grow and strengthen.

The revolutionary youngsters' spirit of daring to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness is also a model for me to learn from. The proletarian cultural revolution is a great revolution that touches the soul. Throughout the cultural revolution, the struggle between public and private interests has been ongoing. Over the past nine months, the victory of the "Red East" commune's revolutionary youngsters is the result of their continuous efforts to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, revolutionizing their souls. They firmly overthrow a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, as well as the ghosts and monsters. They also firmly overthrow anything in their own minds that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. The vivid facts have once again deeply educated me, making me determined to regard myself as a force for the revolution and at the same time regard myself as an object of the revolution. In the past, I also had many selfish thoughts, such as participating in the "three-in-one combination," fearing that people would say I was coming out to seize power and had ambitions. After coming out, I also feared that I might not be strong enough, unable to bear the responsibility, and ruin this team, and so on, all of which were the work of the "self." I learned from the spirit of the "Red East" revolutionary youngsters, breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and these selfish thoughts were all dispelled. I know that in future struggles, new selfish thoughts will emerge. I am determined to reform myself for life and learn from the revolutionary youngsters for life.

In the process of fighting with the revolutionary youngsters, I deeply feel that the merits of the revolutionary youngsters are indelible. If there are people with ulterior motives who use certain shortcomings and mistakes of the revolutionary youngsters to deny their revolutionary merits, that is absolutely not allowed. To deny them is to deny the revolution, and to strike them down is to strike down the revolution. The young generation armed with Mao Zedong Thought is the guarantee that our Party and state will never change color. We older comrades who think we can live off our past merits and pull rank are absolutely wrong. The revolutionary youngsters are challenging us, and the situation is pressing. Let us humbly learn from the revolutionary youngsters, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

    向革命小将学习
    北京地质学院原党委常　委李贵
    在这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，革命小将高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的精神，立下了不朽的功勋，创造了许多英雄业迹，震惊了全世界。
    在无产阶级文化大革命开始的时候，由于我长期以来形成一套框框，总怕出“乱子”。然而，革命小将敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命、敢造反的精神，给我很深刻的教育。他们紧紧掌握斗争大方向，运用毛泽东思想的显微镜和照妖镜，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派现出了原形。不管党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派资格多老，地位多高，革命小将也敢于把他们打翻在地，再踏上一只脚。我认识到革命小将的革命大方向是完全正确的，决心象他们那样，舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马。去年六月二十日，我坚决站出来，同革命小将们在一起，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开斗争。
    革命小将一贯忠于毛泽东思想，忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，使我深深感动。我院党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派对革命小将进行残酷斗争，无情打击。他们开动一切宣传机器，骂革命小将是“暴徒”、“反革命”。他们挑动不明真相的群众向革命小将进行围攻。可是，革命小将无所畏惧，满怀信心，坚持斗争，我坚决向革命小将学习，同他们站在一起。不管那一小撮坏家伙把我打成“现行反革命分子”，甚至监视，扣押我的孩子，逼迫他同我脱离父子关系，我都没有屈服。
    革命小将不畏困难、艰苦奋斗的精神，也值得我好好学习。毛主席教导我们说：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”革命小将正是这样做的。在党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派实行物质封锁，革命小将处于极端困难的情况下，他们发出了“没有汽车有腿，没有喇叭有嘴，没有饭吃喝白开水”的豪言壮语。他们吃不上饭，照样执行紧急任务，照样清晨上操。我在被残酷斗争之后，失去了自由。当时我想：我再出来，会给革命小将添麻烦，让他们自己干吧！但“东方红”小将的革命精神教育了我。我想，我出身于一个三代长工的家庭，十三岁开始给地主放牛扛长活，过着牛马生活，一九三八年参加了抗日工作，是毛主席引导我走上了革命的道路。没有毛主席，就没有我李贵。我怎么能忘本呢？为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，掉脑袋我也要干。在“东方红”小将的支持下，突破重重困难，我又继续揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。后来，我又串连了一些干部和家属参加了革命组织，争取和团结更多的群众，支持革命小将，使革命派队伍不断发展壮大。
    革命小将勇于破私立公的精神，也是我学习的榜样。无产阶级文化大革命，是触及人们灵魂的大革命。在文化大革命中，自始至终贯穿着公与私的斗争。九个月来，东方红公社革命小将的胜利，正是他们不断破私立公，在灵魂深处闹革命的结果。他们对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，以及牛鬼蛇神，都坚决打倒。对自己头脑里不符合毛泽东思想的东西，也是坚决打倒。生动的事实又一次深刻地教育了我，使我决心把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时也把自己当成革命的对象。过去我私心杂念也不少，如参加“三结合”，怕人家说我是出来抢权，有野心。出来以后，又怕自己能力不强，担负不了，把这支队伍搞垮，如此等等，都是“私”字作怪。我学习“东方红”革命小将的精神，破私立公，这些私心杂念一一打消了。我知道在将来的斗争中，还会有新的私心杂念出现。我决心改造一辈子，向革命的小将学习一辈子。
    在同革命小将战斗的过程中，我深深感到：革命小将的功勋是不可磨灭的。如果有别有用心的人，借革命小将的某些缺点错误来否定他们的革命功绩，那是万万办不到的。否认他们就是否认革命，打击他们就是打击革命。用毛泽东思想武装起来的年青的一代，是我们党和国家永不变色的保证。我们年纪大一些的同志，要想凭老本吃饭，摆老资格，是万万行不通的。革命小将在向我们挑战，形势逼人。让我们虚心向革命小将学习，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
