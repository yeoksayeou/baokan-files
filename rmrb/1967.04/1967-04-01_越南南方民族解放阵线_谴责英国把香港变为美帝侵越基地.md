The Hanoi-based Vietnam News Agency reported on March 31 that the Spokesman for the External Relations Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam strongly condemned the British government for following the U.S. policy and allowing the U.S. to use Hong Kong as a base for its aggression against Vietnam.

The Spokesman said that the Wilson government of Britain has long ignored the strong opposition of the people of the world, pursued a policy of following U.S. imperialism, and increasingly strengthened its participation in the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. This is a very serious act by the Wilson government to deliberately become a henchman of the U.S. in strengthening its war of aggression against the people of South Vietnam, and to sabotage the peace and security of the countries in the Indochina Peninsula and Asia.

The Spokesman expressed full support for the correct position stated in the note sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China to the British Charge d'Affaires in China on March 20 this year.

The Spokesman firmly demanded that the British government must stop the above-mentioned illegal acts and respect the basic national rights of the Vietnamese people.

    越南南方民族解放阵线
    谴责英国把香港变为美帝侵越基地
    新华社河内三十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会发言人二十七日强烈谴责英国政府追随美国的政策，纵容美国使用香港作为侵越战争的活动基地。
    发言人说，英国威尔逊政府长久以来无视世界人民的强烈反对，推行追随美帝国主义的政策，日益加强参与美国侵越战争活动。这是威尔逊政府蓄意充当美国加强对越南南方人民的侵略战争的帮凶，破坏印度支那和亚洲各国的和平与安全的极其严重的行动。
    发言人表示完全赞同中华人民共和国外交部今年三月二十日给英国驻华代办处的照会中所阐明的正确立场。
    发言人坚决要求英国政府必须停止上述非法行动，尊重越南人民的基本民族权利。
