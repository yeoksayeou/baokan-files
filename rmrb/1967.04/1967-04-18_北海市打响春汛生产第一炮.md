Beihai City in Guangxi has seen its fishery communes' broad masses of fishermen and grassroots revolutionary cadres engage in a struggle against the fierce winds and waves of the Beibu Gulf, and against the intimidation of the American imperialist bandits. They have struck the first shot for spring tide fishery production this year. In the first voyage of March (each voyage lasts about eight to ten days), the average yield per pair of fishing boats in nine fishery brigades reached 74.4 dan, equivalent to the average yield per pair of fishing boats in March last year.

This year, the spring fishing season arrived later than in previous years. To strike the first shot for spring tide production, it is necessary to persist in offshore operations. The broad masses of fishermen and grassroots revolutionary cadres, armed with Mao Zedong Thought during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, followed the teachings of Chairman Mao, fearing neither the fierce winds and waves of the Beibu Gulf nor the threats of American imperialist bandits. They resolved, "To be determined, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Since early March, most of the fishing boats have persisted in offshore fishing. The "Revolution and Production Command" of Beihai City also dispatched responsible cadres to the front line to direct production. Since the start of the spring tide voyage, members and cadres on the sea and during port rest periods have insisted on studying the works of Chairman Mao. They seriously read "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sing songs of quotations, and some even recite the "Three Old Articles." Revolutionary workers from relevant departments in Beihai City also organized "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams" to conduct propaganda in various fishing ports and fleets.

    北海市打响春汛生产第一炮
    广西北海市各渔业人民公社的广大渔民和基层革命干部，与北部湾的大风大浪搏斗，与美帝国主义强盗的威吓作斗争，打响了今年春汛渔业生产第一炮。三月份的第一次航海（每次航海约八至十天），九个渔业大队平均每对渔船产量达七十四点四担，相当于去年三月份全月平均每对渔船的产量。
    今年，春季渔汛比往年来得迟。要打响春汛生产第一炮，必须坚持到远海作业。在无产阶级文化大革命中用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大渔民和基层革命干部，遵循毛主席的教导，不怕北部湾的大风大浪，不怕美帝国主义强盗的威胁，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们从三月初出海以来，大部分渔船都坚持在远海捕鱼。北海市“抓革命促生产指挥部”也派出负责干部，到第一线指挥生产。春汛出航以来，社员和干部在海上和靠港的休息时间，都坚持学习毛主席著作。他们认真地读《毛主席语录》，唱语录歌，有的还背诵“老三篇”。北海市有关机关的革命职工，也组织了
  “毛泽东思想宣传队”，到各渔港和船队进行宣传。
