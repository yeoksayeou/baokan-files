Carry out Chairman Mao's policy on cadres and unite with the majority of cadres

The revolutionary masses of Qingdao Woodworking Factory have always fought shoulder to shoulder with revolutionary cadres. They have implemented the policy of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient" towards cadres who have made mistakes, and concentrated their efforts on striking down the clique of capitalist roaders within the party.

An article by the editorial board of "Red Flag" magazine points out: "Strike a large area, protect a small group" is a component of the bourgeois reactionary line. The broad revolutionary cadres of Qingdao Woodworking Factory are the victims of this reactionary line. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, 70% of the cadres in this factory were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "black gangs," or "black lines" by the work team that implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, and they suffered political persecution. Some leading cadres who bravely stood up to support the revolutionary mass movement were labeled as "counter-revolutionary leaders," stripped of all political rights, and subjected to brutal struggle sessions. Recently, amidst the call by the revolutionary masses of Qingdao City to launch a general offensive against the number one capitalist roader within the party, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Qingdao Woodworking Factory held a special meeting. They angrily exposed and denounced the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line in the handling of cadre issues and discussed how they smashed the bourgeois reactionary line. The participants also expressed their boundless excitement and sang the praises of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of Chairman Mao's line on cadres.

The following is a summary of the meeting:

"All those who should be overthrown" must be accounted for by the number one capitalist roader within the party

Liang Jiuming (former secretary of the party branch of the maintenance workshop, now a standing committee member of the revolutionary committee of the factory) said: Recently, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party has spread rumors, falsely accusing the proletarian revolutionary masses and the proletarian headquarters of wanting to "overthrow all." This is a complete distortion of facts and a gross slander against the proletarian revolutionary masses. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the rule of the bourgeois reactionary line proposed and implemented by the number one capitalist roader within the party, 70% of the cadres in our Qingdao Woodworking Factory were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "black gangs," or "black lines." This account must be settled with the number one capitalist roader within the party.

At that time, I, along with the factory director Wang Minsheng and the deputy director of the military affairs department Hou Quande, supported the masses and led the way in writing big-character posters to expose the crimes of the clique of capitalist roaders within the party. We were then framed by the work team that implemented the bourgeois reactionary line with various charges and labeled as a "counter-revolutionary group." They stripped us of the right to participate in any meetings or political activities, sent us to the workshop for labor, did not allow us to speak to anyone, and closely monitored us from morning to night. They held many struggle sessions, both big and small, and used various forms of disguised corporal punishment during the struggles. What was even more despicable was that they did not allow us to hear the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao. When the factory conveyed the "Sixteen Points," they did not allow us to hear it. I secretly bought a copy of the "Qingdao Daily" that published the "Sixteen Points," and they, like bats fearing the light, were afraid of Mao's instructions and the revolutionary cadres meeting, and specially held a struggle session, accusing me of secretly reading the "Sixteen Points" and attempting to reverse the verdict. This was not enough; they then illegally decided to forcibly repatriate me and my family, intending for me to wear the "counter-revolutionary" hat forever and never be able to fight against them again. At the same time, they compiled a list of more than 100 people to be repatriated out of the more than 700 people in the entire factory, intending to drive away all the cadres and masses who dared to rebel against them, so that the clique of capitalist roaders within the party could continue to dominate the factory and act arbitrarily. Look, what they did has nothing in common with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line? Isn't this the implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small group"?

However, those who proposed and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line attempted to shift the blame and accuse the proletarian revolutionary masses of wanting to "overthrow all." This is a pipe dream. We, the broad revolutionary cadres of Qingdao Woodworking Factory who have suffered persecution, must stand up and settle accounts with their crimes. We resolutely fight to the end with the number one capitalist roader within the party and the clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the party. We will not rest until we overthrow, smash, and expose them!

The clique of capitalist roaders within the party incites the masses to struggle against cadres and incites cadres to struggle against the masses

Wang Minsheng (former factory director, now a standing committee member of the revolutionary committee of the factory) said: The clique of capitalist roaders within the party is most afraid of revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, especially the combination of revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. From the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in our factory, revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses combined to form a mighty army of proletarian cultural revolution, concentrating their firepower to launch a fierce attack on the clique of capitalist roaders within the factory and the Qingdao Municipal Daily Use Industry Company. The revolutionary situation was excellent. This infuriated those bourgeois lords, and they adopted various despicable means to disintegrate the revolutionary ranks and extinguish the revolutionary flames. They incited the masses to struggle against cadres on one hand, and incited cadres to struggle against the masses on the other. They used threats, bribes, coercion, and other means to force the masses to struggle against the majority of cadres. Those who did not want to struggle were labeled as "black gang lackeys" or "running dogs" and were surrounded and struggled against. They even wrote big-character posters to struggle against cadres themselves and forced workers to line up and sign their names. Those who did not sign were put on a blacklist. On the other hand, they incited cadres to struggle against the masses, saying things like "there are black gangs above and black lines below, we must pursue victory and carry the revolution to the end!" "Even the small minions must be exposed!" "The maintenance workshop is the most poisoned, and it must be thoroughly disinfected." In a few days, a strange wind of cadres struggling against the masses and masses struggling against cadres blew through the entire factory, shrouding it in white terror. A few capitalist roaders within the party sat on the sidelines, watching the "tiger fight on the mountain," enjoying themselves and rejoicing.

However, they were too happy too soon. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought united the hearts of revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres, and the tricks of a few bad guys did not separate us. Soon, the proletarian revolutionary masses in our factory organized combat teams to support us revolutionary cadres. They correctly implemented Chairman Mao's line on cadres, defied the fierce suppression of the class enemy at that time, and risked their lives to combine with us.

We secretly carried out activities and fought against the enemy in a tit-for-tat struggle. "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Because the great Mao Zedong Thought armed us, the truth was in our hands, and our power grew stronger and stronger. Finally, at the end of last December, we seized all the powers of party, government, finance, and culture from the clique of capitalist roaders within the party and achieved a decisive victory!

The proletarian revolutionary masses fight side by side with revolutionary leading cadres and strike down a small clique of bad guys

Liu Guisheng (proletarian revolutionary mass worker, now a committee member of the revolutionary committee of the factory) said: Who is it that most resolutely implements Chairman Mao's policy on cadres? It is us, the working class, the proletarian revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought. This is something that no one can deny. As early as the beginning of the movement, we saw that the work team's practice of "striking a large area and protecting a small group" was extremely reactionary. Chairman Mao taught us that the majority of cadres are good or relatively good. How could they label 70% of the cadres in our factory as bad guys? We also believed that leading comrades such as Wang Minsheng, Liang Jiuming, and Hou Quande bravely stood up to expose the crimes of the clique of capitalist roaders within the party, and the general direction was correct. Such cadres are good cadres of Chairman Mao and should be supported and endorsed. Therefore, we organized the "Dawn Combat Team," first posting big-character posters to criticize the work team for distorting right and wrong and demanding a reversal of their verdict. At the same time, we boldly fought side by side with revolutionary leading cadres. At that time, our strength was still small, and the white terror was still severe. We could not post big-character posters during the day, so we did it at night, even all night long. We thought that for the sake of defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we would not hesitate to sacrifice our lives. A little hard work was nothing. Because these leading comrades had more experience in struggle, they combined with us and step by step fought against the enemy, making the revolutionary forces grow stronger and stronger. Later, we finally jointly seized power from the clique of capitalist roaders within the party. After seizing power, we fully trusted and supported these revolutionary leading cadres who had been tested in the storm of struggle, playing a core and backbone role in the revolutionary "three-in-one" power organ. For those who had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and made mistakes in the past, we saw both their side of suppressing the masses and their side of being deceived; they were both executors and victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. We, with the spirit of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient," helped them quickly correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Some who had made mistakes in the past but now had a deep self-criticism and better performance were even absorbed into the revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organ. Now, the vast majority of the masses and the vast majority of the cadres in our factory have united around the revolutionary committee, and everyone is in high spirits, full of enthusiasm for production, creating a situation where the revolution is booming and production is thriving.

However, a counter-revolutionary reverse current of capitalist restoration is currently sweeping through society, and a small clique of reactionaries dare to accuse the proletarian revolutionary masses of wanting to "overthrow all." We will not agree to this by a thousand or ten thousand! We must use our blood and lives to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Whoever dares to point the spearhead at Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters, we will resolutely fight them to the end. We firmly believe that no matter what tricks the class enemy plays, victory will surely belong to the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

The proletarian revolutionary masses act according to Chairman Mao's instructions

Wang Rusheng (former secretary of the party branch of the third workshop, now a committee member of the revolutionary committee of the factory) said: I am a cadre who implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. During the movement, I was poisoned by the big poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" and had a slave mentality. I blindly obeyed the tasks arranged by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party who usurped the name of the party organization, such as the former Qingdao Municipal Committee, the Qingdao Municipal Daily Use Industry Company Party Committee, and the factory party branch, and did not dare to say a single "no." Therefore, I also participated in the suppression of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses and became an accomplice. After making these mistakes, I felt very heavy-hearted and thought that the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres would not let me off, carrying a burden. However, the facts were completely the opposite. After the proletarian revolutionary masses seized power, they firmly implemented Chairman Mao's policy on cadres. They adopted the policy of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient" towards cadres who had made mistakes, actively talked to me, helped me recognize my mistakes, and still gave me certain powers in my work and supported my work. From this, I truly understood the greatness of Chairman Mao's teaching that "the people, and only the people, are the creators of world history." The true proletarian revolutionary masses are those who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions in everything. They have broad minds and put revolutionary interests first, and they are indeed good soldiers of Chairman Mao. From then on, I put down my psychological burden, felt relaxed, and on the one hand, seriously examined my mistakes, and on the other hand, put all my strength into production with the workers. Now, the proletarian revolutionary masses have absorbed me into the factory revolutionary committee based on my performance. This is the greatest trust of the proletarian revolutionary masses in me. I will definitely stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, humbly learn from the masses, be a student of the masses, and better play my role in future work.

The vast majority of cadres and masses have united around the revolutionary committee

Fang Shiguo (former military affairs officer, now the chairman of the revolutionary committee of the factory) said: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our factory has been fighting a sharp struggle between the two lines in cadre policy from beginning to end. During the period when the bourgeois reactionary line ruled, it struck a large area and protected a small group, inciting workers and cadres against each other, making everyone feel insecure and uneasy, destroying unity, and destroying production. We, the proletarian revolutionary masses, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely implemented the policy of uniting the majority and striking down a small group. Now, the cadres and workers of the entire factory are all in high spirits and full of fighting spirit. Now, the vast majority of cadres and masses have united around the revolutionary committee of the factory, and production is booming. Look at the sharp contrast between these two lines! The root of the bourgeois reactionary line is the number one capitalist roader within the party. According to the confession of a capitalist roader within the party who suppressed the revolutionary masses of our factory at that time, after seeing some black instructions endorsed by the number one capitalist roader within the party in June last year, they became even bolder in suppressing the revolutionary masses of Qingdao Woodworking Factory. Currently, the entire nation is launching a fierce attack on this number one capitalist roader within the party. "It is better to pursue the remaining courage to the end of the enemy, and not to seek fame by learning from the king of Chu." We, the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Qingdao Woodworking Factory, will definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and pull this number one capitalist roader within the party off his horse, thoroughly criticize, smash, and expose him. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory!

    粉碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的阴谋
    执行毛主席的干部政策团结大多数干部
    青岛木器一厂无产阶级革命派始终同革命干部并肩战斗在一起，对犯错误的干部实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派
    《红旗》杂志评论员文章指出：“打击一大片，保护一小撮”是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分。青岛木器一厂的广大革命干部，正是这条反动路线的受害者。文化大革命运动初期，这个厂有百分之七十的干部被执行资产阶级反动路线的工作组打成或者说成是“反革命”、“黑帮”、“黑线”，受到了政治上的迫害。一些勇敢地站出来支持革命的群众运动的领导干部，则被打成“反革命头子”，被剥夺一切政治权利，受到残酷的斗争。最近，在青岛市无产阶级革命派向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击声中，木器一厂的无产阶级革命派和革命干部专门召开座谈会，愤怒地揭发和控诉了在干部问题上的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，谈到了他们怎样粉碎资产阶级反动路线的斗争经过。参加座谈的同志还怀着无比激动的心情，歌颂了战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席干部路线的伟大胜利。
    下面是这个座谈会的纪要：
    “打倒一切”这笔账一定要算在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的头上
    梁汲修（原维修车间党支部书记，现工厂革命委员会常委）说：最近，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大造谣言，把对干部“打倒一切”的罪名强加在无产阶级革命派和无产阶级司令部头上，这完全是颠倒黑白，混淆是非。这是对无产阶级革命派的极大诬蔑。无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出和推行的资产阶级反动路线的统治下，我们青岛木器一厂有百分之七十的干部，被打成了“反革命”、“黑帮”、“黑线”。这笔账一定要算在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的头上。
    当时，我和厂长王民生、武装部副部长侯全德，因为支持群众，并带头写大字报揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，就被执行资产阶级反动路线的工作组捏造种种罪名，打成了“反革命集团”。他们剥夺了我们参加一切会议，进行一切政治活动的权利，把我们赶到车间劳动，不允许和任何人讲话，从早到晚都有人严密监视。大大小小的斗争会开了好多次，斗争中实行各种变相体罚。更加可恶的是，他们不让我们听到伟大领袖毛主席的声音，厂里传达“十六条”，不让我们听。我托人偷偷买了一张刊登“十六条”的《青岛日报》，他们象蝙蝠怕见阳光一样，害怕毛主席的指示和革命干部见面，竟专门开了一个斗争会，说我偷看“十六条”，企图翻案。这还不够，接着他们竟非法地决定把我和我的一家强行遣返原籍，妄想让我从此戴上“反革命”的帽子，再也不能和他们斗争。在这同时，他们在全厂七百多人中排出了一个遣返一百多人的名单，竟想把那些敢于造他们的反的干部、群众，统统赶走，好让党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派继续盘踞在厂里作威作福。请看，他们所做的一切同毛主席的无产阶级革命路线那里有丝毫共同之处？这不是不折不扣地执行了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线又是什么？
    但是，那些提出和推行资产阶级反动路线的家伙，竟企图推卸罪责，把对干部“打倒一切”的罪名强加在无产阶级革命派头上，这是白日做梦。我们青岛木器一厂广大受迫害的革命干部，一定要起来清算他们的罪行。我们坚决同党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子斗争到底，不把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，誓不罢休！
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派挑动群众斗干部，挑动干部整群众
    王民生（原厂长，现工厂革命委员会常委）说：党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，最害怕革命群众，最害怕革命干部，尤其害怕革命群众和革命干部相结合。我们厂里的文化大革命一开始，革命干部和革命群众就结合在一起，组成了浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，集中火力向厂里和青岛市日用品工业公司里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开了猛烈进攻。革命形势好得很。这一来可触怒了那些资产阶级老爷们，他们为了瓦解革命队伍，把这场革命烈火扑灭下去，采取种种卑劣的手段，一方面挑动群众斗干部，一方面又挑动干部整群众。他们利用威胁、利诱、逼供等种种手段，强迫群众斗广大干部，谁不愿斗就被划为“黑帮走卒”、“走狗”，加以围斗。他们甚至自己写好了整干部的大字报，强迫工人排起队来签名，谁不签名，就上黑名单。另一方面，他们又挑动干部整群众，说什么“上有黑帮，下有黑线，要乘胜追击，将革命进行到底！”“小爪牙也要统统揭出来”，“维修车间中毒最深，要彻底进行消毒”。几天之内，全厂刮起了一股干部整群众，群众斗干部的妖风，笼罩着白色恐怖。几个党内走资本主义道路的当权派却在一旁“坐山观虎斗”，逍遥自在，欣喜若狂。
    但是，他们高兴得太早了。伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把我们革命工人和革命干部的心紧紧联结在一起，一小撮坏家伙的挑拨离间，并没有使我们分开。不久，我们厂里的无产阶级革命派就组织了战斗队，来支持我们革命干部。他们正确执行毛主席的干部路线，不顾当时阶级敌人的疯狂镇压，冒着生命的危险来同我们结合。　　　
    我们秘密地展开了活动，同敌人进行针锋相对的斗争。“星星之火，可以燎原”。由于伟大的毛泽东思想武装了我们，真理在我们手里，我们的力量越来越壮大，终于在去年十二月底从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺取了党、政、财、文一切大权，取得了决定性的胜利！
    无产阶级革命派同革命领导干部并肩战斗，狠狠打击一小撮坏家伙
    刘桂声（无产阶级革命派工人、现工厂革委会委员）说：究竟是谁最坚决地执行毛主席的干部政策？是我们工人阶级，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派，这是任何人也否定不了的。我们早在运动初期，就看出工作组那种打击一大片、保护一小撮的做法是十分反动的。毛主席教导我们说，干部大多数是好的和比较好的，怎么他们把我们厂里百分之七十的干部都打成了坏人呢？我们还认为，王民生、梁汲修、侯全德等领导同志勇敢地站出来揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，大方向是对的，这样的干部是毛主席的好干部，应该支持他们，拥护他们。于是，我们组织了“黎明战斗队”，首先贴出大字报，指责工作组颠倒黑白，把他们搞错了，要求给他们平反。同时，我们还大胆地同革命的领导干部肩并肩地共同战斗。那时，我们的力量还很小，白色恐怖依然严重，白天不好贴大字报，就夜里干，甚至通宵地干。我们想，为了维护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，牺牲自己的生命也在所不惜，累一点算什么？由于这些领导同志斗争经验比较丰富，他们和我们结合在一起，一步步地和敌人展开斗争，使革命力量不断壮大。后来，我们终于共同向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺了权。夺权后，对于这些经过斗争大风浪考验过的革命领导干部，我们充分信任，充分支持，发挥他们在革命的“三结合”权力机构中的核心作用和骨干作用。对于过去执行过资产阶级反动路线，犯过错误的干部，我们既看到他们镇压群众的一面，又看到他们受蒙蔽的一面；他们既是资产阶级反动路线的执行者，又是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。我们本着“惩前毖后、治病救人”的精神，帮助他们迅速改正错误，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。有些过去犯过错误，现在检查深刻表现得比较好的，还吸收他们参加了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构。现在我们厂里绝大多数群众和绝大多数干部都已经团结在革命委员会的周围，个个心情舒畅，生产干劲十足，出现了革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾的大好局面。
    但是，目前社会上却掀起了一股资本主义复辟的反革命逆流，一小撮反动家伙竟敢把对干部“打倒一切”的罪名，强加在我们无产阶级革命派头上，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应！我们一定要用鲜血和生命来保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，谁敢把矛头指向毛主席，指向无产阶级司令部，我们就坚决同他干到底。我们坚信，不论阶级敌人耍什么阴谋诡计，胜利一定属于伟大领袖毛主席，属于战无不胜的毛泽东思想！
    无产阶级革命派处处按毛主席指示办事
    王如升（原三车间支部书记，现工厂革命委员会委员）说：我是一个执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部。运动中，由于中了《修养》这棵大毒草的毒，存在着奴隶主义。对前青岛市委、青岛市日用工业品公司党委、工厂党总支的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派盗用党组织的名义布置的任务，盲目服从，不敢说一个“不”字。因此，自己也参与了镇压革命干部和革命群众的活动，当了帮凶。我在犯了这些错误以后，心情很沉重，认为革命派和革命干部一定饶不了我，背上包袱。但是事实完全相反，无产阶级革命派掌权后，坚定不移地执行毛主席的干部政策，他们对于犯错误的干部采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，主动找我谈话，帮助我认识错误，在工作上他们仍然给我一定的职权，并且支持我的工作。从这里，我真正认识到毛主席所说的“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”这一教导的伟大。真正的无产阶级革命派，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，处处按毛主席的指示办事，他们胸怀广阔，把革命利益放在第一位，不愧是毛主席的好战士。从此，我放下了思想包袱，心情舒畅，一方面认真检查自己的错误，一方面拿出浑身的力量和工人们一起抓生产。现在，无产阶级革命派根据我的表现，又吸收我参加了工厂革命委员会，这是无产阶级革命派对我的最大信任。我一定要坚定不移地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，虚心向群众学习，当群众的小学生，在今后的工作中更好地发挥自己的作用。
    绝大多数干部和群众团结在革命委员会的周围
    房世果（原武装干事，现工厂革命委员会主任委员）说：我们工厂在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在干部政策上自始至终贯穿着尖锐的两条路线的斗争。资产阶级反动路线统治时期，打击一大片，保护一小撮，挑拨工人和干部的关系，弄得人人自危，个个不安，破坏了团结，破坏了生产。我们无产阶级革命派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行了团结大多数，打击一小撮的政策，全厂干部职工，人人心情舒畅，个个斗志昂扬。现在，绝大多数干部和群众都团结在工厂革命委员会的周围，生产蒸蒸日上，提前超额完成了第一季度计划。请看这两条路线是多么鲜明的对比啊！资产阶级反动路线的总根子，就是那个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。据当时镇压我厂群众运动的前青岛市委某一个党内走资本主义道路的当权派供认，去年六月，他们看到党内头号走资本主义道路当权派批转的一些黑指示以后，镇压木器一厂革命群众运动的胆子更大了。目前，举国上下都已向这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派展开了猛烈攻击。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们青岛木器一厂的无产阶级革命派和革命干部，一定遵循伟大领袖毛主席的这一教导，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派拉下马，彻底把他批倒、批垮、批臭。不获全胜，决不收兵！
