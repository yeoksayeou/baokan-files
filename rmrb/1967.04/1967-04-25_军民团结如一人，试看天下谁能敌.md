The People's Liberation Army in Shenyang, including the Model Red Ninth Company and eight other exemplary units, have resolutely responded to the call of the Central Cultural Revolution Group to elevate the relationship between the military and the people to a new level and a new height, and to develop the glorious tradition of the PLA loving the people to a new stage.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 24 — The People's Liberation Army in Shenyang, including the Model Red Ninth Company, the company where Lei Feng served, the company where Liu Yingjun served, the company where Dong Cunrui served, the company where Jin Yihua served, the company where Sun Zhongjie served, and the company where the exemplary unit for unity and love for the people served, jointly wrote an article titled "The People's Liberation Army and the People United as One, Who Can Defy Us?" The full text of the article is as follows:

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is entirely for the people. It is thoroughly for the people's interests."

The foundation for serving the people is to love the people. Loving the people is our army's glorious tradition. Comrade Jiang Qing, representing the Central Cultural Revolution Group, especially emphasized at the celebration of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee that we must support the army and love the people. This is a great encouragement and a great impetus for us. We express our most enthusiastic support and resolutely respond. We will unconditionally execute the Central Military Commission's eight orders and ten orders, maintaining and carrying forward our army's glorious tradition of loving the people.

We deeply feel that at this critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a decisive battle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, when we are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call and taking on tasks such as supporting the left, supporting industry, and supporting agriculture, strengthening the unity between the military and the people and launching a wave of supporting the army and loving the people has extremely important and far-reaching significance.

The new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has put forward new content and new requirements for the army's love for the people. It requires us with new awareness, new understanding, and new attitudes to elevate the relationship between the military and the people to a new level and a new height, and to develop our army's glorious tradition of loving the people to a new stage.

What is "new"? The "new" lies in our understanding of loving the people, which must be elevated to a higher level and a higher line. That is, we must love the people from a political perspective, from major issues, major problems, and major directions. Loving the people from a political perspective, from major issues, major problems, and major directions is the greatest love for the people.

The greatest love for the people is to think what the revolutionary masses think and to be concerned about what the revolutionary masses are concerned about. What the revolutionary masses think and are concerned about is the issue of power. We firmly support the revolutionary masses in seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and we actively help them to hold power and use power properly. This is the most crucial love for the people.

The greatest love for the people is to feel the pain of the revolutionary masses and to hate what the revolutionary masses hate. What the revolutionary masses hate the most is the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, especially the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We must resolutely join the revolutionary masses to criticize them down, criticize them to pieces, and criticize them to stink, making sure they never stand up again. This is the most thorough love for the people.

The greatest love for the people is to love what the revolutionary masses love and to be close to what the revolutionary masses are close to. What the revolutionary masses love and are close to the most is the great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. We must join the revolutionary masses to help them study and apply Chairman Mao's works, letting the invincible Mao Zedong Thought guide everything, transform everything, and promote everything, turning the great spiritual force into a great material force. This is the most fundamental love for the people.

In summary, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is the most loving line for the people. Loyalty to and implementation of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is the highest, best, and greatest love for the people.

To loyally implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we must correctly understand the masses and correctly understand ourselves.

Chairman Mao says: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "The people have boundless creativity." The revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses have the greatest courage, the greatest daring, the greatest enthusiasm, and the greatest wisdom. They, with the great wisdom and courage of the proletariat, have created immortal achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We, the People's Liberation Army, participating in the "three supports" work, must not regard ourselves as "liberators." We must believe in the masses to the greatest extent, rely on the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and let the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves. Our work for them can only be assistance, not taking over; only strengthening, not imposing.

Chairman Mao teaches us: We should not regard those non-essential and non-mainstream issues as essential and mainstream, thus confusing our direction. The broad revolutionary masses and the revolutionary young people's general direction is always correct. The general direction is their essence and mainstream. It is inevitable that they have this or that flaw and mistake in such a great revolutionary movement. We must conduct in-depth investigations and research, perform class analysis, and must not regard non-essential and non-mainstream things as too big, too many, or too heavy, thus losing our general direction.

Chairman Mao says: "The masses are the real heroes." We must put down all kinds of burdens and humbly be the masses' little students. The advantages of the revolutionary masses, we must seriously learn; the criticisms of the revolutionary masses, we must warmly welcome. To uphold what is good for the people's interests and to correct what is wrong for the people's interests, this is our principle. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is a line with "public" as the core. Only by constantly breaking private interests and establishing a worldview of the proletariat that is wholeheartedly for the public, everything for the public, and a lifetime for the public, can we correctly understand, loyally implement, and bravely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao says: "The army must blend with the people, making the army seen as their own in the eyes of the people. Such an army is invincible in the world." We firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, wholeheartedly supporting the broad revolutionary masses of the left, steadfastly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses, breathing together, sharing the same destiny, uniting together, fighting together, and winning together. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and monsters in society play tricks, use deceit, spread rumors, and stir up trouble, attempting to destroy our blood relationship with the proletarian revolutionary masses. In the end, they will only end up lifting a rock to drop on their own feet.

The People's Liberation Army and the people united as one, who can defy us!

    军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌
    解放军沈阳部队红九连等九个模范单位，坚决响应中央文革小组提出的号召，决心把军民关系提高到新水平、新高度，把解放军爱民的光荣传统发展到新的阶段
    新华社沈阳二十四日电　人民解放军沈阳部队学习毛主席著作的模范红九连、某部雷锋生前所在班、某部刘英俊生前所在连、某部董存瑞生前所在班、某部爱民模范金遗华生前所在班、某部爱民模范孙忠杰生前所在班、某部团结爱民模范连等九个连队，联名写了一篇题为《军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌》的文章。文章全文如下：
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
    为人民的基础是爱人民。爱民是我军的光荣传统。江青同志代表中央文革小组在北京市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会上特别强调地提出要拥军爱民，这对我们是很大的鼓舞，很大的鞭策。我们表示最热烈的拥护，最坚决地响应。我们一定不折不扣地执行中央军委八条命令和十条命令，保持和发扬我军爱民的光荣传统。
    我们深深感到，在无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，在我们热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，担负起支左、支工、支农等项工作的时候，加强军民团结，掀起拥军爱民的高潮，具有极为重大、极为深远的意义。
    无产阶级文化大革命的新形势为军队爱民提出了新的内容，提出了新的要求。它要求我们以新的觉悟、新的认识、新的姿态，把军民关系提高到新的水平、新的高度，把我军爱民的光荣传统发展到新的阶段。
    “新”在那里呢？新就新在我们对爱民的认识要“上纲”“上线”，爱民的内容也要“上纲”“上线”。就是说，要突出地从政治上，从大事情、大问题、大方向上爱民。从政治上，从大事情、大问题、大方向上爱民，是最大的爱民。
    最大的爱民就是要想革命群众所想，急革命群众所急。革命群众所想所急的是政权问题，我们坚定地支持无产阶级革命派夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，并积极帮助他们掌好权，用好权。这是最关键的爱民。
    最大的爱民就是要痛革命群众所痛，恨革命群众所恨。革命群众所最痛恨的，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，特别是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。我们要坚决同革命群众一起，把他们批倒、批垮、批臭，叫他们永世不得翻身。这是最彻底的爱民。
    最大的爱民就是要爱革命群众所爱，亲革命群众所亲。革命群众所最爱最亲的，是伟大的领袖毛主席和光焰无际的毛泽东思想。我们要同革命群众一起，帮助他们学好用好毛主席著作，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅一切、改造一切、推动一切，把伟大的精神力量化为伟大的物质力量，这是最根本的爱民。
    归根结底一句话，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线是最最爱民的路线。忠实地贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就是最高最好最大的爱民。
    我们要忠实地贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就要正确地认识群众，正确地认识自己。
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“人民群众有无限的创造力。”无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，他们有最大的勇敢、最大的魄力、最大的干劲、最大的智慧，他们以无产阶级的大智大勇，在无产阶级文化大革命中创建了不朽的功勋。我们解放军参加“三支”工作，万万不能以“解放”者自居。我们必须最大限度地相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。我们的工作对他们只能是帮办，而不能是包办；只能是加强，而不能是强加。
    毛主席教导我们：不应当将那些非本质方面、非主流方面的问题看成本质和主流，以致迷惑了自己的方向。革命左派广大群众和广大革命小将的大方向始终是正确的。大方向就是他们的本质和主流。他们在这样大的革命运动中有这样那样的缺点和错误，是难免的。我们一定要深入调查研究，进行阶级分析，决不能把非本质非主流的东西看得过大、过多、过重，使自己迷失了大方向。
    毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄”。我们要放下种种包袱，虚心当群众的小学生。革命群众身上的优点，我们要认真学习；革命群众的批评，我们要热诚欢迎。为人民利益坚持好的、为人民的利益改正错的，就是我们的宗旨。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线是“公”字当头的路线。只有我们不断地破私立公，树立无产阶级的一心为公、一切为公、一生为公的世界观，才能正确地理解、忠实地贯彻、勇敢地捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    毛主席说：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”。我们牢记毛主席的教导，全心全意地支持革命左派广大群众，坚定不移地站在无产阶级革命派一边，和他们同呼吸，共命运，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，耍阴谋，施诡计，造谣惑众，挑拨离间，妄图破坏我们同无产阶级革命派的血肉联系，到头来只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌！
