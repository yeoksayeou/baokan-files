Tianjin’s broad revolutionary masses and garrisoned troops enthusiastically welcomed the screening of the large-scale color documentary film “Mao Chairman Is the Red Sun in Our Hearts – Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People’s Republic of China.” The broad revolutionary masses, with boundless love for the great leader, enthusiastically hailed Chairman Mao’s eternal life and hailed the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the invincible and boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought.

Many old workers at Tianjin’s Third Wool Textile Factory (formerly the private-owned Dongya Wool Textile Factory) could not contain their excitement and watched the film with tears in their eyes. They said, Chairman Mao is always with the working class. He understands us the most, cares for us the most, and trusts us the most. Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts. Many old workers saw Chairman Mao walking across the Golden Water Bridge, walking among the people, and sitting on the ground with everyone to watch fireworks, and they were so moved that they shed tears. Some old workers recalled the situation when the number one capitalist-roader in the Party came to their factory, and they indignantly said, this traitor who infiltrated the Party, when he came to our factory in April 1949, did not meet with the broad masses of workers but went straight into the arms of the capitalists. Later, when he reluctantly met with worker representatives, he shamelessly said that in the past, could you have seen someone like me? Now in China, I am either number one or number two. This revealed his wolfish ambitions. Because he protected the reactionary capitalist Song Qiying in our factory, we were unable to carry out democratic reforms in the early days of liberation, and the factory’s power remained in the hands of the capitalists’ agents. For seventeen years, the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads has been particularly intense in our factory. They said, in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, we workers have risen up and launched a struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, criticize and expose the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, and forever preserve our socialist iron-clad mountains and rivers for eternity!

Many Red Guards who went to Beijing last year to be received and inspected by Chairman Mao felt even more blessed and excited after watching this film. The Red Guards of Tianjin Institute of Physical Education who study Mao Zedong Thought said, when we saw the great leader Chairman Mao, radiant and full of vitality, come among the people, we were reminded of the unforgettable happy moment when Chairman Mao received us Red Guards last year. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we followed Chairman Mao closely, never forgot Chairman Mao’s teachings, overcame one storm after another, and achieved one victory after another. We love Chairman Mao even more, love Mao Zedong Thought even more, love Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line even more, and hate the number one capitalist-roader in the Party even more, and hate the bourgeois reactionary line even more. We must follow Chairman Mao’s words and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution.

In response to Chairman Mao’s great call, the People’s Liberation Army troops stationed in Tianjin, who are actively supporting the broad leftist masses and supporting industrial and agricultural production, were greatly inspired after watching this film. They said they would definitely hold high the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more firmly support the leftists politically and ideologically, assist revolutionary workers and poor and lower-middle peasants to grasp the revolution and promote production. Many soldiers, after watching the film, all expressed that they must remember Comrade Lin Biao’s instruction during the National Day speech to “turn the entire country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.” They said, we support the broad masses of the left, support production, promote the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought. We must always use Mao Zedong Thought to solve all problems that arise in the revolution and production, arm the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought. This is our glorious mission that we must never forget.

    天津广大军民喜看纪录影片《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》
    热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆  热烈欢呼文化大革命的伟大胜利
    新华社天津二十四日电　天津市广大革命群众和驻军指战员，热烈欢呼《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳——庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年》大型彩色文献纪录影片的放映。广大革命群众怀着无限热爱伟大领袖的心情，热烈欢呼毛主席万寿无疆，欢呼无产阶级文化大革命在战无不胜的光焰无际的毛泽东思想指引下，取得了一个又一个伟大的胜利。
    天津市第三毛纺织厂（原私营东亚毛纺织厂）的许多老工人按捺不住内心的激动，含着眼泪看完了这部影片。他们说，毛主席他老人家永远和我们工人群众心连心。他老人家最了解我们，最关心我们，最相信我们。毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。许多老工人看到毛主席走过金水桥，走到群众中去，和大家一块席地而坐，观看焰火，都激动得流下眼泪。一些老工人回想起当年党内头号走资本主义道路当权派到他们工厂的情况，不由得非常愤慨地说，这个混进党内的工人阶级的大叛徒，在一九四九年四月到我们厂来的时候，不和我们广大工人见面，一头就扎到资本家的怀里。后来，他迫不得已和工人代表见了一面，还恬不知耻地说什么要是在过去，你们能见到我这样的人吗？我现在在中国不是数一就是数二。一句话暴露了他的狼子野心。由于他包庇了我厂的反动资本家宋棐卿，使我们厂在解放初期没有能够进行民主改革，工厂的许多大权，一直掌握在资本家的代理人手中。十七年来，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，在我们厂特别激烈。他们说，在毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们工人发动起来了，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展了夺权斗争。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派批倒、斗臭，永保我们社会主义的铁打江山千秋万代不变颜色！
    很多去年到北京受到毛主席接见和检阅的红卫兵小将们，看了这部影片，更加感到无限幸福和激动。天津体育学院毛泽东思想红卫兵战士们说，当我们看到伟大领袖毛主席满面红光，神采奕奕地来到群众中，使我们又回想起去年伟大领袖毛主席接见我们红卫兵的难忘的幸福时刻。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们紧跟着毛主席，时刻不忘毛主席的教导，战胜了一个又一个的急风恶浪，取得了一个又一个的胜利。我们更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱毛泽东思想，更加热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，也更加痛恨党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，更加痛恨资产阶级反动路线。我们一定听毛主席的话，永远跟着毛主席闹革命。
    响应毛主席的伟大号召，正在积极支持广大左派群众、支持工业和农业生产的人民解放军驻津部队指战员们，看了这部影片以后，人人无限振奋。他们表示，一定要更高地举起战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加坚定地从政治上、思想上支持革命左派，协助革命职工、贫下中农抓好革命，促好生产。很多指战员看了影片以后，都表示要牢记住林彪同志在国庆节讲话中发出的“我们要把全国变成为一个毛泽东思想的大学校”的指示。他们说，我们支持左派广大群众，支援生产，促进无产阶级革命派大联合，一步也离不开毛泽东思想。我们要时时处处用毛泽东思想解决革命和生产中出现的一切问题，用毛泽东思想武装革命群众，这是我们一刻也不能忘记的光荣任务。
