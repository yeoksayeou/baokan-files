Vice Chairman of the Cambodian-China Friendship Association Says the Chinese Cultural Revolution Will Achieve Complete Victory

A Bright and Radiant Future Lies Ahead for the Chinese People

Japanese Friend Says the Cultural Revolution Will Have a Major Impact on the World

According to Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh: Recently, the Vice Chairman of the Cambodian-China Friendship Association, Sy Neng, published an article in the Cambodian newspaper "New Telegraph" refuting foreign news agencies' slander against the Chinese Cultural Revolution. He pointed out, "There is no doubt that all these foreign lies, especially the fierce attacks on China and its great helmsman Chairman Mao Zedong, further confirm that the developments in China are extremely favorable for the Chinese people and the socialist revolution in China. The Chinese people have every reason to believe in their Chairman's words: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.'"

The article states: "The Chinese Cultural Revolution, like the experience of the October Revolution, is an unprecedented experience in human history."

The article states that under the guidance of their great leader's scientific thought, the Chinese proletariat, together with all revolutionary allies, are launching this cultural revolution, "which will only strengthen the proletariat's power in China and enable the proletariat to achieve new, brilliant victories. A bright and radiant future lies ahead for the Chinese people."

The article concludes: The future will tell us that these words will be scientifically proven. Despite the rumors, attacks, and slander, despite attempts to sabotage the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of other countries, China will never retreat and will continue to advance along the socialist path.

According to Xinhua News Agency, according to a report from the East Asia News Agency: Recently, the leader of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association's Friendly Trade Delegation to China, Kawa Seiichiro, spoke to the press in Tokyo, enthusiastically praising the Chinese Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

Kawa said: The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, following Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution and promote production," are diligently fighting, making industrial and agricultural production develop very well during the Cultural Revolution.

The executive director of the Kansai International Trade Promotion Association, Kimura Ichizo, said in a speech: The Cultural Revolution has already achieved great, decisive victories. This will make China's socialist construction advance at a scale and speed that will shock the world, and it will definitely have an extremely significant impact on the world situation.

    据新华社金边电　柬埔寨—中国友好协会副主席符宁不久前在柬埔寨《新电讯报》上发表文章，驳斥外国通讯社对中国无产阶级文化大革命的诽谤，并且指出，“毫无疑问，所有这些国外的谎言、特别是对中国及其伟大舵手毛泽东主席的猛烈攻击，更加证实了中国的事态发展对于中国人民和中国的社会主义革命都是极其有利的。中国人民完全有理由相信他们主席的这句话：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’”
    文章说：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命同十月革命的经验一样，是人类历史上没有先例的经验。”
    文章说，中国无产阶级在他们伟大领袖的科学思想的指引下，联合所有革命同盟军展开目前这场文化大革命，“这只会加强无产阶级在中国的政权，并使无产阶级能够取得新的、辉煌的胜利。中国人民面前展现着光辉灿烂的未来。”
    文章最后说：未来将告诉我们，这些话会得到科学的证实。尽管有人造谣、攻击和诬蔑，尽管有人破坏中国人民同其他国家人民的友谊，中国是永远不会后退的，中国正沿着社会主义的道路一往直前。
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本国际贸易促进协会友好贸易访华代表团团长川濑一贯不久前在东京向新闻界发表谈话，热烈赞扬由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    川濑说：用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，遵循毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的指示，勤奋地战斗着，使工农业生产在无产阶级文化大革命中有了非常好的发展。
    日本关西国际贸易促进协会专务理事木村一三发表谈话指出：无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的决定性的胜利。这将使中国的社会主义建设以震惊全世界的规模和速度向前发展，它肯定会对世界局势产生极其重大的影响。
