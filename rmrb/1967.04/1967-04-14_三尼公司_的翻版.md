The reincarnation of the "Three N Company"

The right-wing military regime in Indonesia, beset by internal and external troubles, has intensified its betrayal of national interests to curry favor with and repay the support of its two great patrons, American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique. It has recently opened the door wider for foreign capital to infiltrate Indonesia.

The treacherous actions of the Indonesian reactionaries, needless to say, have greatly pleased American imperialism and the Soviet revisionists. After the Sukarno regime issued the foreign investment decree at the end of last year, the United States wasted no time in signing an agreement with it, granting American monopolistic capital the privilege to plunder and exploit Indonesia. The Soviet revisionists are not far behind. Recently, through its trade representative in Jakarta, it expressed its willingness to invest in Indonesia according to the "foreign investment" law. How in step are the actions of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists in supporting the Indonesian right-wing military regime to suppress and exploit the Indonesian people!

The difference is: the Americans are blatantly aggressive, while the Soviet revisionists are hesitant but follow closely. Not long ago, the Soviet revisionists still hypocritically criticized the Indonesian authorities for "opening up broad avenues for foreign capital to enter the Indonesian economy." But no sooner had the words left their mouths than they eagerly rushed to walk down this "broad avenue," becoming accomplices of the imperialist bloodsuckers.

Why do the Soviet revisionists follow the footsteps of American imperialism so closely? This is a close coordination. They have always been colluding together, vigorously supporting the Indonesian right-wing military regime. You apply the rouge, I apply the powder. You give a "aid," I give a "loan." You provide weapons, I supply ammunition. In short, they are both sparing no effort to bolster the Sukarno regime, encourage it, and give it blood transfusions. The Americans, the Soviet revisionists, and the Indonesian reactionaries have become as close as one family. Moreover, in the eyes of the Soviet revisionists, investing in Indonesia not only supports the Indonesian reactionaries but also benefits themselves. How could they not rush to do it?

The Soviet revisionists, in pursuit of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," have long stood together with American imperialism to support the reactionaries of various countries, recruiting soldiers for their counter-revolutionary "holy alliance." Khrushchev and Kennedy jointly established the infamous "Three N Joint Venture Company" in India (this company is still struggling to survive). Today, the situation in Indonesia is nothing more than a reincarnation of this old brand.

### “三尼公司”的翻版

    “三尼公司”的翻版
    内外交困的印尼右派军人政权，变本加厉地出卖民族利益，以换取和报答美帝国主义和苏联修正主义集团这两个大恩主对它的支持。它最近又为外国资本渗入印尼，进一步打开大门。
    印尼反动派的这种卖国行径，不用说，使得美帝国主义和苏修集团大为满意。去年年底苏哈托政权颁布外国投资法令之后，美国就捷足先登，马上同它签订了一项协定，使美国垄断资本取得在印尼进行掠夺和剥削的特权。苏修集团也不甘落后，最近，通过它在雅加达的商务代表机构官员，表示愿意根据印尼的“外国投资”法令在印尼投资。美帝和苏修支持印尼右派军人政权镇压和剥削印尼人民的步调，是何其一致啊！
    所不同的是：美帝是赤裸裸地大干，苏修则是扭扭捏捏地紧跟。苏修在不久以前还假惺惺地指责印尼当局“为外国资本输入印尼经济开辟了广阔的道路”。然而语音未落，它就迫不及待地要走上这条“广阔的道路”，成为帝国主义吸血鬼的同路人。
    苏修集团对美帝国主义的脚印为什么跟得那么紧呢？这是一种紧密的配合。他们一直就勾结在一起，大力扶植印尼右派军人政权。你给它涂脂，我替它抹粉。你送一笔“援助”，我给一笔“贷款”。你交一批武器，我运一批弹药。总之，都在不遗余力地给苏哈托政权撑腰，打气，输血。美帝、苏修和印尼反动派，已经亲如一家人了。何况在苏修集团看来，在印尼投资既支持了印尼反动派，而自己又有利可图，它怎能不争着去干呢？
    苏修集团为了追求“美苏合作主宰世界”，早就同美帝国主义站在一起支持各国的反动派，为他们的反革命“神圣同盟”招兵买马。赫鲁晓夫、肯尼迪在印度就创办了臭名昭著的“三尼合股公司”（这家公司尚在惨淡经营）。今天，在印尼出现的情况，不过是这家老字号的翻版罢了。
