The lights went out, and the construction site fell silent. However, in the dormitory of the Chinese technicians assisting in the construction of a textile factory and the installation of a power plant boiler in Yemen, people were still reciting Chairman Mao's brilliant works "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Quotations from Chairman Mao." One person recited, "A foreigner, with no selfish motives, regarded the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause. What spirit is this?" Another person immediately followed, "This is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism. Every member of the Communist Party of China must learn this spirit."

Every night, the technicians assisting in the construction of the textile factory and the installation of the power plant boiler in Yemen recite the "Little Red Book." They arm themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide their work, overcome one difficulty after another, and achieve one victory after another.

Learning the Spirit of "Moving Mountains"

In the process of installing the power plant boiler, a large amount of cutting, welding, and pipe straightening work is required, all of which cannot be done without oxygen. According to the agreement, the engineering oxygen was originally supposed to be provided locally. However, due to the blockade imposed by the British authorities in Aden at that time, oxygen could not be imported. What should be done in the absence of oxygen? Should they stop work and wait for supplies, or follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties to win victory"?

The Chinese overseas technical personnel under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought would never be intimidated by difficulties. Without oxygen, they could find other ways to substitute it. Some suggested, "No matter how big the pipe, we can saw it with a hacksaw." Others proposed, "Use a blowtorch for straightening," "Use electric welding to replace gas welding..."

These methods were time-consuming and labor-intensive, but to ensure the installation of the power plant boiler and the completion of the entire textile factory construction project on schedule, they remained unwavering. Many pipes that could originally be cut with oxygen had to be sawed with a hacksaw. The saw teeth became dull, and a pipe was not yet cut through. However, they remained undaunted, replacing one saw with another. Using a blowtorch was the same; if one was not enough, they used two or three. In some places, they used a hammer to tap bit by bit. Their hands blistered, but they continued to persist. They said, "No matter how hard the pipe is, our determination is harder." In this way, they completed the cutting, drilling, and welding tasks for four 550-kilowatt diesel generators and three 6.5-ton oil-fired boilers ahead of schedule despite the severe shortage of engineering oxygen.

Taking on Heavy Burdens

In August of last year, welder Sun Zhongling fell ill with gastroenteritis. At that time, the installation was at a critical moment, and he was welding the pipes of the boiler. Meanwhile, the installation of five large oil tanks needed to begin immediately, requiring welding. Should he wait for another welder, or should he take on the task himself? Sun Zhongling was in a struggle. He opened Chairman Mao's works and studied Mao's teachings again: "Hard work is like a burden placed before us, see if we dare to take it on. Burdens come in different weights. Some people pick the light ones and push the heavy ones to others, choosing the easy tasks. This is not a good attitude." He felt that these words were directed at him, so he took on the welding task of the large oil tanks.

Welding the oil tanks was an outdoor job. The scorching sun made the oil tanks like a large steamer, and even sticking one's head in for a moment made one breathless, let alone going inside to weld? The working conditions were extremely difficult, and Sun Zhongling almost fainted several times. At this critical moment, he repeatedly recalled Chairman Mao's teachings and the internationalist spirit of Dr. Bethune, instantly regaining boundless strength. Despite his illness, he completed the work of two people.

Going Where Needed

After arriving in Yemen, the technicians assisting in the construction of the textile factory and the installation of the power plant boiler in Yemen firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and were determined to learn the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, as exemplified by Zhang Side. Flue wall insulation worker Liu Daoping and another Chinese comrade arrived at the construction site and saw over 20,000 fire-resistant bricks piled up like small hills, needing to be unpacked and moved. How long would it take to move so many bricks? At this moment, they thought of the spirit of "Moving Mountains" that Chairman Mao called on everyone to learn.

It was June, and the weather in Sa'ada was extremely hot. The ropes and fire-resistant bricks were scorching under the sun. Liu Daoping and the others, being new to the high-altitude climate, were breathless even when walking. However, with the spirit of the old man who moved mountains, they encouraged themselves, took firm steps, and worked without stopping. Two Yemeni workers also joined in, eagerly helping to move the bricks. As a result, they completed the moving of over 20,000 fire-resistant bricks two months ahead of schedule. Later, they also used this "Moving Mountains" spirit to unpack and sort out tens of thousands of silica bricks and dozens of tons of other fire-resistant and insulation materials.

Liu Daoping also led his apprentices to erect the scaffolding for the flue wall. Without a painter, he learned the technique of painting and completed a large amount of painting work for the boiler, auxiliary machinery pipes, and oil tanks. The drainage ditch outside the canteen, about a hundred meters long, was blocked, so Liu Daoping quietly used his lunch break to clean it and covered it with wooden planks. Many Yemeni workers were deeply moved and praised him, saying, "You are great!"

Other comrades were the same; they went wherever the work needed them.

Carrying Forward the Spirit of Continuous Battle

The electrical group received an urgent task to charge the batteries and prepare the cable heads within ten days. Due to the shortage of manpower, it was difficult to complete these two tasks at the same time. After accepting the task, they studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous battle (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." After repeated study and discussion, they decided to charge the batteries during the day and work overtime at night to prepare the cable heads, arranging the work in shifts and launching a continuous assault.

The actions of the Chinese technicians deeply moved the Yemeni workers. They said, "We want to be like you, not afraid of hardship and fatigue, working hard." When it was time to get off work, a few Yemeni workers did not want to leave and quietly followed the Chinese technicians to work overtime. It was late, and they were persuaded to go back to rest, but they insisted on staying at their posts.

The Yemeni workers learned that the Chinese technicians were so responsible at work and so caring and loving in life because of the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings. They not only competed to work with the Chinese technicians but also expressed their desire to study Chairman Mao's works. They said, "We want to be like you, study Chairman Mao's works, and do our jobs well."

    事事处处牢记毛主席教导
    ——记援助也门建设的中国技术人员活学活用毛主席著作
    灯灭了，工地上一片寂静。但是，在中国援助也门修建纺织厂安装电站锅炉组同志们的寝室里，人们还背诵着毛主席的光辉著作《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》。一个人背诵道：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？”另一个人马上接上去说：“这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，每一个中国共产党员都要学习这种精神。”
    中国援助也门修建纺织厂安装电站锅炉组的同志每晚都是这样地集体背诵“老三篇”。他们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑和指导自己的工作，克服了一个又一个的困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    学习“愚公移山”精神
    在安装电站锅炉的工程中，需要进行大量的切割、火焊校管工作，而这些工种都离不开氧气。按照协议，工程用氧原定当地解决。但由于亚丁英国当局当时对也门实行封锁，氧气无法进口。在氧气缺乏的情况下怎么办？是停工待料呢，还是按照毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    毛泽东思想教导下的中国援外技术人员，绝不能让困难吓倒，没有氧气，可以用其他办法代替。有的人说：“不管多大的管子，我们都用锯条来锯。”还有的人建议：“用喷灯校管”，“用电焊开洞代替火焊……。”
    这些办法使用起来既费时间又花力气，但是，为了不影响电站锅炉的安装任务，为了保证整个纺织厂修建工程能按期完成，他们毫不动摇地坚持了下来。许多用氧气切割的管道，本来一下就可以切割好，而他们现在要用锯条来锯。锯齿磨秃了，一条管道还没有锯断。但是，他们毫不灰心，锯秃了一根又换上一根。用喷灯也是一样，一个不行，就用两个、三个。还有的地方用槌子一点点地敲，手上出了血泡，还继续坚持。他们说：“管道再硬，没有我们的决心硬。”就这样，他们在严重缺乏工程用氧的情况下，提前完成了四台五百五十瓩柴油发电机和三个六吨半燃油炉安装所需要的切割、钻孔和焊接任务。
    争取挑重担子
    去年八月间，电焊工孙仲令患了肠胃炎。那时正是安装的紧张时刻，他正在焊接炉机的管道，而另外五个大油罐的安装工作又需开始，要立即焊接。是等另外一个焊工来，还是自己动手干？孙仲令思想斗争着。他打开了毛主席著作，又一次学习了毛主席的教导：“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。”他感到毛主席的这段话正是针对他说的，于是，就主动地把大油罐的焊接任务也担当起来。
    焊接油罐是在露天工作，火热的太阳晒得油罐象一个大蒸笼，连把头伸进去一下，都叫人透不过气来，何况要到里面去进行焊接？工作条件是非常困难的，孙仲令几次都差点昏倒。就在这困难的时刻，他一次又一次记起毛主席的教导，想起白求恩同志的国际主义精神，全身马上增添了用不完的力量，终于带病坚持工作，一个人完成了两个人的任务。
    哪里需要就到哪里去
    中国援助也门修建纺织厂安装电站锅炉组的同志来到也门后，牢牢记住毛主席的教导，决心努力学习张思德同志那样彻底地为人民服务的精神。炉墙保温工刘道平和另一位中国同志来到工地后，看到两万多块耐火砖象几座小土山一样堆在那里需要拆包和搬开。这么多砖要多少时候才能搬完呢？这时，他们想起毛主席号召大家学习的“愚公移山”的精神。
    当时正是六月间，萨那天气酷热，草绳和耐火砖被太阳晒得滚烫。刘道平他们由于初来这里，对高原气候还不大适应，连走起路来都气喘。但是，他们两人以老愚公搬走两座大山的精神勉励自己，坚定地迈开大步，不停地干了起来。两个也门工人也跟着抢着搬运。结果，他们比原计划提前两个月就把两万多块耐火砖搬完了。他们后来也用这种“愚公移山”的精神，开箱清理了几万块矽藻砖和数十吨其他耐火、保温材料。
    刘道平还带领徒工去搭砌炉墙的脚手架。没有油漆工，他又学习了上油漆的技巧，为锅炉、附机管道和油库等进行了大量的油漆工作。食堂外边百把米长的排水沟堵塞了，刘道平又悄悄地利用中午休息时间进行清理，并盖上了木板。许多也门工人看了以后非常感动，连连伸手称赞他是“好样的”。
    其他同志也是这样，哪里工作需要他们就到哪里去。
    发扬连续作战的作风
    电气组接到紧急任务，要在十天内充好蓄电池，做好电缆头。由于人手少，在同一时间内完成这两项工作是困难的。他们接受这项任务后，便集中全组一起学习毛主席的语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”经过反复学习和讨论后，他们就决定白天上班充蓄电池，晚上加班做电缆头，工作交叉安排，连续突击。
    中国技术人员的行动，深深地感动了也门工人。他们说，“我们要象你们一样不怕苦、不怕累，认真地工作。”下班时间到了，几个也门工人不肯离开，悄悄地跟着中国技术人员加班工作。时间晚了，劝他们回去休息，但他们仍然坚持在岗位上。
    也门工人了解到，中国技术人员在工作上所以能认真负责，生活上又是那么关心、爱护他们，是由于伟大的领袖毛主席的教导。他们不仅争着同中国技术人员干活，还表示要学习毛主席著作。他们说：“我们要象你们那样，学习毛主席著作，把工作做好。”
