The editorial board of the newspaper conducted an investigation.

Editor's note: After reading this investigative report, one can see that the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party shamelessly and brazenly praises the bourgeoisie and sings the praises of the exploitation system. This is a blatant exposure of his reactionary bourgeois nature and a revelation of his conspiracy to develop capitalism in China.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "After the people overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, where should China go? Towards capitalism or socialism?... The facts have answered this question: only socialism can save China."

The capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party, however, goes against the tide. On the eve of our democratic revolution's victory, he ran around everywhere, together with those extremely reactionary big capitalists, singing the same tune, vigorously advocating "exploitation is meritorious" and cursing workers for "rebelling unreasonably." His aim was to encourage the bourgeoisie to ruthlessly exploit the broad masses of workers, to lead China down the capitalist road, to make China return to the dark world of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism, and to make the broad laboring people live a life worse than cattle. This would cause a great historical retrogression.

"When the wind blows, the grass bends." In a society with classes, class struggle exists objectively and cannot be changed by people's will. Since the bourgeoisie's class struggle does not stop, since the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party's onslaught against us does not stop, then the proletariat must unleash a strong east wind, overwhelm the west wind, and overwhelm all enemies. Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, we must launch a mass criticism movement to thoroughly expose the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and fight them down, fight them over, and fight them to stink!

Let us, in the political, economic, cultural, and ideological realms, thoroughly expose the poison spread by the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party, thoroughly criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, and make this great criticism movement the driving force for everything.

On January 15, 1949, Tianjin was liberated.

On March 5, 1949, the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Party was convened in Xibapo Village, Ping Mountain County, Hebei Province. Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his report, clearly pointed out to the whole Party and the people of the whole country:

"In urban struggles, whom do we rely on? Some confused comrades think it is not the working class but the poor masses. Some even more confused comrades think it is the bourgeoisie. In terms of developing industry, some confused comrades think it is not mainly to help the development of state-owned enterprises but to help the development of private enterprises; ... We must criticize these confused ideas."

"The struggle between restriction and anti-restriction will be the main form of class struggle within the new democratic state. If one thinks that we do not need to restrict capitalism now and that we can abandon the slogan of 'controlling capital,' this is completely wrong; this is the viewpoint of right opportunism."

The capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party, however, sang a different tune, vigorously advocating the development of capitalism in China.

On April 21, 1949, the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party personally visited the original Dongya Woolen Textile Factory in Tianjin.

This factory was established in 1932 with a total capital of 230,000 yuan, of which 100,000 yuan was invested by the then military governor of Shandong, Governor Han Fuqu. Soon, the factory's general manager, Song Qinqing, also ingratiated himself with the largest bloodsucker of the "four big families" in China, securing investment from Kong Xiangxi. In 1936, the factory's capital increased from 230,000 yuan to 1 million yuan. In 1937, when the Japanese invaders occupied Beijing, Song Qinqing also hooked up with the Japanese invasion army headquarters in Beijing, securing the task of producing military sacks, using nearly half of Dongya Woolen Textile Factory's production capacity to intensify production, and becoming a running dog for Japanese imperialism's invasion of China. From then on, Song Qinqing was politically loyal to imperialism and dependent on the Kuomintang reactionaries, "serving two masters, passing down two systems," and was extremely reactionary.

Since the establishment of this factory, the reactionary heads who have visited include:

- U.S. Imperialist Marine Corps Brigadier General Loch;
- U.S. Imperialist Ambassador to China Stuart;
- U.S. Imperialist President Truman's personal representative Lock;
- Cardinal Tien, appointed by the Vatican;
- Kuomintang Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi;
- Kuomintang Social Affairs Minister Gu Zhenggang; ...

When it was heard that such a "big shot" as the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party was coming to Tianjin to visit the capitalists, Song Qinqing's reactionary arrogance was at its peak. At a small symposium convened by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, he brazenly challenged the person presiding over the meeting and viciously attacked the Communist Party. He said: "Since the Communist Party advocates freedom of speech and freedom of religious belief, we have the freedom not to believe in Marxism-Leninism and the freedom to oppose communism."

The capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party took a fancy to this factory, which ruthlessly exploited workers and was known as the "civilized hell," and to this extremely reactionary big capitalist, Song Qinqing. He invited Song Qinqing and other capitalists to hold a symposium and specially visited Dongya Woolen Textile Factory to meet with Song Qinqing. On these occasions, the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party brazenly advocated "exploitation is meritorious" and shouted "rebelling is unreasonable," dreaming the same dream as Song Qinqing of developing capitalism.

Advocating "Exploitation is Meritorious"

At the symposium, Song Qinqing again played his old tune: "They suffer small poverty, I suffer big poverty, we are all poor. I built the factory and fed so many workers, and in the end, I am called an exploiter. I really don't know what exploitation is."

The capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party replied: You, Mr. Song, do not understand the meaning of the word "exploitation." "Exploitation" is a term translated from a foreign language, and it can also be found in the Communist Party's dictionary. If you don't want to hear it, we can change it! In fact, you are feeding the workers. The more factories you build, the more workers you exploit, the better. Now you run one factory and exploit a thousand people. In the future, if you run ten factories and exploit ten thousand people, twenty thousand people, it will be even better.

The capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party also said: "The exploitation of capitalists has historical merits, and no Communist Party member will deny the merits of capitalists. They may be cursed, but their merits still exist. Of course, there are some sins, but merits outweigh sins. Today, Chinese capitalism is in its youth, and it is the time to develop its historical role, positive role, and establish merits. We should hurry up and not miss the opportunity. Today, capitalist exploitation is legal, the more the better, and dividends should be increased."

He also said: "Today, capitalist exploitation is not only without sin but also has merits. After the removal of feudal exploitation, capitalist exploitation is progressive. Today, it is not that factories are too many and workers are too many, but too few. The pain of workers and peasants lies in the fact that no one exploits them. You have the ability to exploit more, which is beneficial to the country and the people, and everyone agrees."

When someone mentioned that Song Qinqing, in order to squeeze more blood from the workers, issued stock to the workers and implemented so-called "worker shareholding," the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party praised it, saying: This is of a cooperative nature.

Finally, when Song Qinqing complained: "Workers go on strike, the factory is hard to manage, let it go to waste!" The capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party immediately comforted him, saying: You should work hard, happiness has just begun. No matter when, even in communism, you will have a future. You should still sit in a car, maybe it won't be called a manager then, but your status will be the same.

Shouting "Rebelling is Unreasonable"

When the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party came to Dongya Woolen Textile Factory, the workers, who had just been liberated from deep suffering, were very dissatisfied with the capitalist's ruthless exploitation. The military representative stationed at the factory reflected some of the workers' opinions, and the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party, in front of Song Qinqing, asked the military representative in a contemptuous tone: When did you join the revolution! He also said: In terms of policy, you still need to understand it well! This military representative was soon transferred from Dongya Woolen Textile Factory because he spoke a few words for the workers.

Under the workers' repeated strong demands, the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party, accompanied by Song Qinqing, met with the workers' representatives. At the meeting, on one side stood his stinking wife, holding a coat, and on the other side, someone was holding a thermos for him. Behind him stood the capitalist Song Qinqing, puffing out his chest.

According to the old workers' recollection of the situation at that time, the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party said to the workers: Now, your status has been raised. In the past, could you have seen someone like me! Now, I am either number one or number two in China.

He also said: Now, we are doing labor-capital mutual benefit, you should work hard to produce. You should believe in Manager Song, he has the ability to run the factory well.

Finally, he said: Workers should not make trouble, capitalists will not rebel, workers should listen to the company.

Dreaming the Same Dream as the Capitalists

The capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party's visit to Dongya Woolen Textile Factory made Song Qinqing feel that he had "new hope and new life." On April 30, he wrote a letter to the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party and sent him his evil plan for developing capitalism—"My Dream."

"My Dream" was written in 1947. In "My Dream," Song Qinqing proposed to expand the original woolen textile factory into a trust that includes woolen mills, hemp mills, chemical mills, artificial silk mills, as well as iron mills and printing mills. To realize his ambition, he also proposed to implement a series of evil measures of ruthless exploitation of workers by Western big capitalists, such as "worker shareholding," "worker specialization," and "collective life."

In the letter to the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party, Song Qinqing also specifically proposed plans such as "adding night shifts," "purchasing more raw wool to increase production," and "planning to open a second sack factory." He finally said: "I respectfully report this outline first. In the future, the progress of the implementation will be reported to receive guidance."

Soon, Song Qinqing received a reply from the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party expressing great praise. The reply said: "I am pleased to learn that the workers of your company are united, and the labor and capital are jointly striving to expand production and set up new factories. I hope that you will continue to work hard under the principle of considering both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital. The future is bright, and the revival of the country and the nation is just around the corner."

Song Qinqing said: "My dream of developing enterprises is like a dream I have been dreaming for so many years. Today, it is really going to be realized. —This is my turning point from passive waiting to active development."

At this time, the "troubles" of many lawless capitalists in Tianjin disappeared like smoke. They were "like being injected with morphine" and "very pleased," unanimously shouting: "Long live New Democracy!"

The capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party's dream of relying on bloodsuckers like Song Qinqing to develop capitalism in China was shattered. Soon, Song Qinqing swindled about 400 million yuan from the state and fled to Hong Kong, eventually dying in South America.

Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are advancing with firm steps on the broad road of socialism. They will turn poisonous weeds into fertilizer and, through the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party and the big bloodsuckers' singing and harmonizing, the people will once again receive education on class and class struggle, and see more clearly the treacherous face of the capitalist-roading chief power-holder within the party, who betrays the revolution and betrays the proletariat!

    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹资本主义剥削制度的罪证
    〔一九四九年四月党内头号走资本主义道路当权派拜访天津私营东亚毛纺织厂（现为天津市第三毛纺织厂）的情况调查〕
    本报编辑部调查员
    编者按：读了这份调查材料，可以看到党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，竟然这样露骨、这样无耻地吹捧资产阶级，歌颂剥削制度。这是他的资产阶级反动本性的大暴露，是他梦想在中国发展资本主义阴谋的大暴露。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“当人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治之后，中国要向那里去？向资本主义，还是向社会主义？……事实已经回答了这个问题：只有社会主义能够救中国。”
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却反其道而行之。在我国民主革命胜利的前夕，他就到处奔走呼号，和那些极端反动的大资本家，同唱一个调子，竭力宣扬“剥削有功”，大骂工人“造反无理”。其目的是鼓励资产阶级放肆地残酷剥削广大工人群众，把中国引向资本主义道路，使中国重新回到半殖民地半封建的黑暗世界，使广大劳动人民重新过着牛马不如的生活，造成历史的大倒退。
    “树欲静而风不止”。在有阶级的社会里，阶级斗争是客观存在，不以人们的意志为转移的。既然资产阶级进行阶级斗争的西风不止，既然党内头号走资本主义道路当权派对我们发动猖狂进攻的西风不止，那么，无产阶级就应当刮起强劲的东风，压倒西风，压倒一切敌人，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，展开群众性的大批判，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子彻底斗垮、斗倒、斗臭！
    让我们在政治、经济、文化、思想等各个领域里，彻底揭发党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所散布的毒素，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，使这个大批判运动，成为带动一切的动力。
    一九四九年一月十五日，天津解放了。
    一九四九年三月五日，党的七届二中全会在河北省平山县西柏坡村开幕。我们伟大领袖毛主席在他所作的报告中，明确地向全党和全国人民指出：
    “在城市斗争中，我们依靠谁呢？有些糊涂的同志认为不是依靠工人阶级，而是依靠贫民群众。有些更糊涂的同志认为是依靠资产阶级。在发展工业的方向上，有些糊涂的同志认为主要地不是帮助国营企业的发展，而是帮助私营企业的发展；……我们必须批判这些糊涂思想。”
    “限制和反限制，将是新民主主义国家内部阶级斗争的主要形式。如果认为我们现在不要限制资本主义，认为可以抛弃‘节制资本’的口号，这是完全错误的，这就是右倾机会主义的观点。”
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派却大唱反调，极力为在中国发展资本主义而奔走呼号。
    一九四九年四月二十一日，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派亲自拜访了原天津东亚毛纺织厂。
    这个工厂开办于一九三二年，资金共二十三万元，其中有十万元由当时山东的大军阀、省政府主席韩复榘投资。不久，工厂总经理宋棐卿又攀上了中国最大的吸血鬼“四大家族”，争得了孔祥熙的投资。一九三六年，企业资金由二十三万元一跃而为一百万元。一九三七年日寇侵占北平，宋棐卿又和北平日本侵略军军部挂上了钩，揽来了生产军用麻袋的任务，以东亚毛纺织厂近一半的生产能力加紧生产，充当了日本帝国主义侵略中国的帮凶。从此，宋棐卿对外效忠于帝国主义，对内依附于国民党反动派，“一仆二主，两系传家”，政治上十分反动。
    自这个厂开办以来，前来拜访的反动头目有：
    美帝国主义的海军陆战队少将洛奇；
    美帝国主义的驻中国大使司徒雷登；
    美帝国主义头子杜鲁门的私人代表洛克；
    被梵蒂冈任命的红衣大主教田枢机；
    蒋匪帮的财政部长孔祥熙；
    蒋匪帮的社会部长谷正纲；……
    听说党内头号走资本主义道路当权派这样的“大人物”要到天津来拜访资本家，宋棐卿的反动气焰嚣张极了。他在当时中共天津市委召开的小型座谈会上，猖狂地向主持会议的人挑战，恶毒地攻击共产党。他说：“共产党既然提倡言论自由，宗教信仰自由，我们就有不信仰马列主义的自由，就有反对共产主义的自由。”
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派看中了这个残酷剥削工人、有“文明地狱”之称的东亚毛纺织厂，看中了这个极端反动的大资本家宋棐卿。他邀请宋棐卿和其他资本家举行了座谈，特意到东亚毛纺织厂拜会了宋棐卿。在这些场合，这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派明目张胆地鼓吹“剥削有功”，大叫“造反无理”，跟宋棐卿做着同一个发展资本主义的“梦”。
        鼓吹“剥削有功”
    在座谈会上，宋棐卿又重弹了他过去的老调：“他们闹小穷，我闹大穷，都穷。我盖了工厂，养活了这么多工人，最后还落个剥削，我真不知道什么叫剥削。”
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派接着回答说：你，宋先生，不明白剥削两字的意思，“剥削”是外国翻译过来的名词，在共产党的词典里，也可以找到这个词。你不愿意听，可以换一个嘛！实际上，你是养工人的。你盖的工厂越多，剥削的工人越多，就越好。你现在办一个厂，剥削一千人，将来办十个厂，剥削一万人，两万人，就更好了。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派还说：“资本家的剥削是有历史功绩的，没有一个共产党员会抹煞资本家的功劳。骂是骂，功劳还是有的。当然罪恶也有一点，但功大罪小。今天中国资本主义是在青年时代，正是发展他的历史作用、积极作用、建立功劳的时候，应该赶紧努力，不要错过。今天资本主义剥削是合法的，愈多愈好，股息应该提高。”
    又说：“今天资本主义的剥削不但没有罪恶，而且有功劳，封建剥削除去以后，资本主义剥削是有进步性的。今天不是工厂开得太多，剥削工人太多，而是太少了，工人、农民的痛苦在于没有人剥削他们，你们有本事多剥削，对国家对人民都有利，大家都赞成。”
    当有人提到宋棐卿为了更多地压榨工人的血汗，发给工人股票，搞所谓“职工股东化”时，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派夸奖说：这是合作社性质的。
    最后，当宋棐卿大发牢骚说：“工人闹罢工，工厂不好管，荒了算了！”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派立即安慰说：你们要好好干，幸福刚刚开始，无论到什么时候，到共产主义也好，都有你们的前途，该坐小汽车的还是坐小汽车，也许那时候不叫经理，但地位还是一样。
        大叫“造反无理”
    当党内头号走资本主义道路当权派来到东亚毛纺织厂的时候，刚从水深火热中解放出来的工人对资本家的残酷剥削非常不满。驻厂军事代表反映了工人的一些意见，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派就当着宋棐卿的面，以轻蔑的口气斥问军事代表：你是什么时候参加革命的！还说：在政策方面，你还得好好领会！这个军事代表就是因为替工人讲了几句话，不久便被调离了东亚毛纺织厂。
    在工人一再强烈要求下，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派由宋棐卿陪同，和工人代表见了一面。见面时，一边站着的是他的臭老婆，提着一件大衣，另一边还有人替他抱着一个暖水瓶，后面站着的是挺胸腆肚的资本家宋棐卿。
    据老工人回忆当时的情况，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派曾经对工人说：现在，你们地位提高了。要是在过去，你们能见到我这样的人吗！我现在在中国不是数一就是数二。
    他还说：现在搞劳资两利，你们应该好好生产。你们应该相信宋经理，他有能力把工厂办好。
    最后，他说：工人不要捣乱，资本家不会造反，工人要听公司的。
    跟资本家做着同一个“梦”
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的东亚毛纺织厂之行，使宋棐卿感到“有了新的希望与新的生命”。他在四月三十日给党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派写了一封信，并寄去了他的发展资本主义的罪恶计划——《我的梦》。
    《我的梦》作于一九四七年。宋棐卿在《我的梦》里，提出要把原有的毛纺织厂扩展成为拥有毛纺厂、麻纺厂、化学厂、人造丝厂以及铁工厂、印刷厂等的托拉斯。为了实现他的野心，他还提出要实行“职工股东化”、“职工专门化”、“生活集体化”等一整套西方大资产阶级残酷剥削工人的罪恶措施。
    宋棐卿在给党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的信中，还具体地提出了“加开夜班”，“添购原毛增加生产”，“筹划再开设麻袋第二厂”等计划。最后还说：“谨先将此概要奉闻，以后进行至何程度，必随时报告聆受指导也。”
    不久，宋棐卿收到了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派表示大加赞赏的回信。回信中说：“得悉贵公司职工团结，劳资双方共同努力扩大生产，增设新厂之计划，甚为欣慰。望本公私兼顾劳资两利之方针，继续努力，前途光明，国家民族之复兴指日可待也。”
    宋棐卿说：“我发展企业的理想象个梦，一直梦了这么多年，今天才真要实现了。——这是我由消极等待到积极发展的转折点。”
    这时，天津许多不法资本家的“烦恼”都烟消云散了。他们“象打了吗啡针一样”“甚为欣慰”，齐声高呼：“新民主主义万岁！”
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派想依靠宋棐卿之类吸血鬼，在中国发展资本主义，这个梦破灭了。不久，宋棐卿骗取了国家约四百余万元的财富，逃往香港，最后死于南美。
    中国人民在伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，以坚定的步伐，在社会主义的康庄大道上迈进。他们将把毒草当肥料，从党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和大吸血鬼的一唱一和中，人们再一次经受阶级和阶级斗争的教育，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的背叛革命、背叛无产阶级的面目看得更清楚了！
