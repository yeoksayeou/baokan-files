The Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee of Senegal recently issued a statement strongly condemning the Soviet revisionists and their accomplices for intensifying their efforts to split the Afro-Asian people's united anti-imperialist movement. The statement also solemnly declared that it would adhere to the legal resolutions passed at the Winnipeg Conference and decided to participate in the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference to be held in Beijing this year.

The statement, signed by the renowned Senegalese professor Li·Tidiya·Nai·Bedi on behalf of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee of Senegal, said: "We are firmly convinced that the Fifth Conference to be held in Beijing this year will achieve great success and will inflict a heavy defeat on the holy alliance of imperialists, revisionists, reactionaries, and all kinds of traitors."

The statement condemned the Soviet revisionists and their accomplices for illegally convening a so-called Eighth Afro-Asian Solidarity Council meeting in Nicosia, brazenly altering the legal resolutions of the Winnipeg Conference, and illegally deciding to hold a so-called Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Algiers.

The statement pointed out that the actions of the Soviet revisionists "are part of a policy to split the Afro-Asian people's united anti-imperialist movement, to implement a counter-revolutionary, pro-imperialist, capitulationist, treacherous, and anti-Chinese line." The statement emphasized, "Such conspiracies and despicable farces are intolerable."

The Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee of Senegal announced in the statement: "All decisions made in Nicosia are completely invalid."

The statement expressed that the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee of Senegal "will stand firmly with all revolutionaries to defend the revolutionary line of unity against imperialism."

The statement also said that the anti-imperialists of Senegal did not send anyone to attend the Nicosia meeting. "Therefore, if there were Senegalese involved in the crimes of the Soviet revisionists in Nicosia, we can irrefutably confirm that they only represent themselves and not the Senegalese people."

The Afro-Asian Writers' Liaison Committee of Senegal recently issued a statement in Bamako, strongly condemning the Soviet modern revisionists for illegally convening a fake "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" in Beirut. The statement firmly supported the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing this year.

The statement, signed by Li·Tidiya·Nai·Bedi, pointed out that the fake "Third Conference" held by the Soviet revisionists in Beirut was "an illegal and counter-revolutionary act, which we strongly condemn." The statement said that the Soviet revisionists' planned split activities were more rampant than ever before.

The statement said: "Now everyone is clear that the revisionists openly betray the fundamental interests of the people of various countries and have become a commando unit for imperialism to sabotage all anti-imperialist organizations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Undoubtedly, they are the fifth column in the revolutionary ranks. They offer the people of Asia and Africa as sacrifices to the imperialist invaders, oppressors, and exploiters."

The statement said: "We strongly support the resolutions passed at the emergency conference of Afro-Asian writers held in Beijing in June 1966, especially the legal resolution to hold the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference in Beijing in 1967." The statement expressed firm support for the statement issued by the Permanent Bureau of Afro-Asian Writers on March 21 condemning the Soviet revisionists' split and sabotage of the Afro-Asian writers' movement. The statement emphasized, "The crimes of the revisionists and their accomplices will not stop the revolutionary forces from smashing all splitist and capitulationist conspiracies. The people of Asia and Africa dare to struggle and will fearlessly eliminate imperialism and revisionism." The statement concluded, "The Afro-Asian Writers' Liaison Committee of Senegal will attend the Third Conference to be held in Beijing this year. It will stand shoulder to shoulder with all revolutionary organizations gathered in Beijing and make its own contribution to continue the unyielding struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and for national liberation."

    塞内加尔亚非团结会等谴责苏修分裂亚非反帝运动
    坚决捍卫革命路线  粉碎苏修投降路线
    支持今年在北京召开亚非团结大会和作家大会
    新华社巴马科一日电　塞内加尔亚非团结委员会最近发表声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义者及其同伙在加紧进行分裂亚非人民团结反帝运动的罪行，并且严正宣布：它坚持在温尼巴大会上通过的合法决议，决定参加将于今年在北京召开的第五届亚非人民团结大会。
    由塞内加尔著名教授利·蒂迪亚内·贝迪代表塞内加尔亚非团结委员会签字的这项声明说：“我们深信，今年即将在北京举行的第五届大会必将取得巨大的成就，并将使帝国主义者、修正主义者、反动派和形形色色的叛徒的神圣同盟遭到惨重的失败。”
    声明谴责苏联修正主义者及其同伙非法在尼科西亚召开所谓的第八届亚非团结理事会会议，悍然篡改了温尼巴大会上的合法决议，非法决定在阿尔及尔举行所谓第五届亚非人民团结大会。
    声明指出，苏联修正主义者的所作所为，“是推行分裂亚非人民团结反帝运动的政策，以贯彻反革命的、亲帝国主义的、投降主义的、叛卖的和反华的路线”。声明强调说：“这种阴谋诡计和阴险的丑剧是不可容忍的。”
    塞内加尔亚非团结委员会在声明中宣布：“所有在尼科西亚作出的决定全都根本无效”。
    声明表示，塞内加尔亚非团结委员会“将同所有的革命者一起，始终不渝地捍卫团结反帝的革命路线”。
    声明还说，塞内加尔反帝者没有派遣任何人出席尼科西亚会议。“因此，如果在尼科西亚有塞内加尔人参与了苏联修正主义者的罪行的话，我们可以无可驳斥地证实，他们只代表他们自己，而不代表塞内加尔人民。”
    新华社巴马科一日电　亚非作家塞内加尔联络委员会最近在巴马科发表声明，强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义者在贝鲁特非法召开的伪
  “第三届亚非作家大会”，坚决支持将于今年内在北京举行的第三届亚非作家大会。
    由利·蒂迪亚内·贝迪签署的声明指出，苏修在贝鲁特强行召开的伪“三大”是“一种非法的和反革命的行动，我们强烈地予以谴责”。声明说，苏修有计划的分裂活动比以往任何时候都更为嚣张。
    声明说：“现在所有的人都很清楚，修正主义者公开出卖各国人民的根本利益，成了帝国主义从内部破坏非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲国家所有反帝组织的一支别动队，毫无疑问，他们是革命队伍中的第五纵队。他们把亚非人民作为牺牲品奉送给帝国主义侵略者、压迫者和剥削者。”
    声明说：“我们强烈支持一九六六年六月在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议所作的各项决议，特别是关于一九六七年在北京举行第三届亚非作家大会的合法决议。”声明表示坚决支持亚非作家常设局三月二十一日发表的谴责苏修分裂和破坏亚非作家运动的声明。声明强调说：“修正主义者及其同谋者的罪行，阻止不了革命力量去粉碎一切分裂主义和投降主义阴谋。亚非各国人民敢于斗争，将不顾一切地去肃清帝国主义和修正主义。”声明最后说：“亚非作家塞内加尔联络委员会将出席今年在北京召开的第三届大会。它将同所有聚会在北京的革命组织并肩进行斗争，作出它自己的贡献，以继续加强反对帝国主义、反对修正主义和争取民族解放的始终不渝的斗争”。
