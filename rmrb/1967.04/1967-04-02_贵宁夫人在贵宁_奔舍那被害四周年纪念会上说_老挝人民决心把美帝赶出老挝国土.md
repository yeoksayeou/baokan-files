A memorial meeting was held in Beijing today to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the brutal murder of Kaysone Phomvihane, former Foreign Minister of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, by American imperialism and its lackeys.

Mrs. Kaysone Phomvihane spoke at the memorial meeting, recounting the glorious victories achieved by the revolutionary people of Laos in their struggle against American imperialism. She said that now, American imperialism has been bogged down in the people's war waged by the Lao people. The Lao people, together with the great Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world, are determined to drive American imperialism out of Lao soil.

She stated that the aggressive activities of American imperialism to expand the war of aggression only show that they are already weak and desperate. She expressed the Lao people's firm support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism.

Mrs. Kaysone Phomvihane enthusiastically praised the friendship between the peoples of China and Laos. She said, "I wholeheartedly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. This revolution, which has profound implications not only in China but also around the world, provides valuable experience for all oppressed peoples fighting for liberation."

The memorial meeting was attended by Lian Guan, President of the China-Laos Friendship Association, Ding Xilin, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and relevant officials, as well as representatives of the revolutionary masses.
