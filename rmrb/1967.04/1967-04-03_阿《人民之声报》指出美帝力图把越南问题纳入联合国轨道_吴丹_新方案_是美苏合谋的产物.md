	Albanian "People's Voice" Newspaper Points Out U.S. Imperialism Attempts to Bring the Vietnamese Issue onto the United Nations Track
	U Thant's "New Plan" is a Product of U.S.-Soviet Collusion

	Tirana, April 3 (Xinhua) - The editorial department of the Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper published an article today stating that the so-called "three-point proposal" recently put forward by United Nations Secretary-General U Thant for resolving the Vietnamese issue is essentially a new version of Johnson's "peace talks" deception, and is another shameless plot by Johnson and his accomplices to bring the Vietnamese issue onto the United Nations track.

	The article said that U Thant's "three-point proposal" is in line with the plans of U.S. imperialism. Firstly, just as the Johnson administration demands, U Thant's "three-point proposal" does not distinguish between the aggressor and the victim, attempting to cover up U.S. imperialism's dirty war against the Vietnamese people and exonerate U.S. imperialism from its serious crimes; secondly, U Thant calls for a "complete ceasefire" in his "three-point proposal," which also meets the demands of Washington. U Thant is essentially asking the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and forcing the Vietnamese people to accept American-style "peace"; thirdly, U Thant proposes to reopen the Geneva Conference. However, it is well known that it is the U.S. imperialists themselves who tore up the 1954 Geneva Agreement and trampled on the most basic international legal norms. The U.S. imperialist leaders shout "ready to go to Geneva at any time," only to attempt, with the support of their accomplices and allies, to obtain through negotiations what they cannot achieve through force: the submission and surrender of the Vietnamese people.

	The article said that precisely because U Thant's "three-point proposal" caters to the needs and interests of U.S. imperialism, it has been publicly welcomed by Johnson and Rusk. Washington has been loudly advocating for this plan and has been working hard to cover up the U.S. imperialism's "escalation" of the war in Vietnam, its intensified intervention in Laos, and its continuous provocations and conspiratorial activities against Cambodia.

	The article emphasized that U Thant's new plot is the result of backroom deals between U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leaders.

	The article said that the Johnson administration has more than once attempted, just as its predecessors did in Korea, the Congo, and other places, to use the United Nations flag to cover up its bloody aggression in Vietnam. The corridors of the United Nations have now become a suitable place for imperialists and revisionists to conduct backroom political deals and speculations. The efforts of Johnson and his accomplices to bring the Vietnamese issue onto the United Nations track are another cunning plot against the Vietnamese people.

	The article said that the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam expressed the will of the Vietnamese people, condemning this plot by Johnson and his accomplices. The only correct way to resolve the Vietnamese issue is through the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The Albanian people will forever support the just struggle of their Vietnamese brothers against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its lackeys. The Albanian people support the correct stance of the statement by the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This statement reaffirms that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnamese issue, and the Vietnamese issue can only be resolved by the Vietnamese people themselves.

    阿《人民之声报》指出美帝力图把越南问题纳入联合国轨道
    吴丹“新方案”是美苏合谋的产物
    新华社地拉那一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》一日发表编辑部文章说，联合国秘书长吴丹最近抛出的所谓解决越南问题的“三点建议”实质上是约翰逊“和谈”骗局的新翻版，是约翰逊及其帮凶企图把越南问题纳入联合国轨道的另一个无耻阴谋。
    文章说，吴丹的“三点建议”和美帝国主义的计划如出一辙。因为第一，正如约翰逊政府所要求的，吴丹的“三点建议”，对侵略者和被侵略者不加区分，企图掩盖美帝国主义反对越南人民的肮脏战争，为美帝国主义开脱严重的罪责；第二，吴丹在“三点建议”中呼吁“全面休战”，这也是符合华盛顿的要求的。吴丹实际上要越南人民放下武器，强迫越南人民接受美国式的“和平”；第三，吴丹建议重开日内瓦会议。但是众所周知，正是美帝国主义者自己撕毁了一九五四年的日内瓦协议，而且践踏了最起码的国际法准则。美帝国主义头子叫嚷“随时准备到日内瓦去”，只不过是为了在它的同伴和帮凶的支持下，妄图在谈判桌上得到它用武力得不到的东西：使越南人民屈服和投降。
    文章说，正是因为吴丹的“三点建议”迎合了美帝国主义的需要和利益，所以受到约翰逊和腊斯克的公开欢迎。华盛顿大肆鼓吹同意这个方案，并开动宣传机器竭力掩盖美帝国主义在越南的战争“升级”、美帝国主义对老挝的加紧干涉和对柬埔寨的连续挑衅和阴谋活动。
    文章着重指出，吴丹的新阴谋是美帝国主义者和苏修领导人之间进行幕后交易的共同结果。
    文章说，约翰逊政府曾不止一次地企图象它的前任在朝鲜、刚果等地做过的那样，用联合国的旗帜掩盖它在越南的血腥侵略。联合国的走廊现在成为帝国主义和修正主义进行幕后政治交易和投机的合适场所。约翰逊及其帮凶企图把越南问题纳入联合国轨道的努力，是反对越南人民的又一个狡猾阴谋。
    文章说，越南民主共和国外交部发言人表达了越南人民的意志，谴责了约翰逊及其帮凶的这个阴谋。越南问题的唯一正确解决办法是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。阿尔巴尼亚人民将永远支持兄弟的越南人民反对共同敌人美帝国主义者及其仆从的正义斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民支持越南民主共和国外交部发言人声明的正确立场。这一声明重申联合国无权干涉越南问题，越南问题只能由越南人民自己来解决。
