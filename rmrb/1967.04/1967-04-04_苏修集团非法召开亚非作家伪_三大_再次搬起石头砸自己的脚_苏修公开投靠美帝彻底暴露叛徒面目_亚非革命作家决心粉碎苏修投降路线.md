	The Soviet revisionist clique, defying the strong condemnation and warnings of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau and dozens of revolutionary writers' organizations and nationalist parties in several Asian and African countries, forcibly convened the fake "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, from March 25 to 29. The splitist conference, orchestrated by the Soviet revisionists, fully exposed their open alignment with U.S. imperialism, their open sabotage of the Afro-Asian writers' movement and the Afro-Asian peoples' united struggle against imperialism, and their determination to make enemies of the Afro-Asian peoples and the vast majority of revolutionary and progressive writers. This is another serious crime committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership against the Afro-Asian revolutionary peoples, following their illegal convening of the so-called Eighth Afro-Asian Solidarity Council in Nicosia in February.

	As early as last June, under the auspices of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau headquartered in Colombo, an emergency conference of Afro-Asian writers was held in Beijing, attended by representatives from 53 Asian and African countries and regions. The conference decided to hold the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference in Beijing this year. The Soviet revisionists were extremely afraid that this conference would be held in Beijing, the capital of China, where the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is vigorously underway. They were also afraid that the Afro-Asian writers' movement would, after this conference, raise the banner of opposing U.S.-led imperialism and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the Afro-Asian peoples even higher, and that their line of capitulation and compromise would suffer a more thorough defeat. In this situation, they did not hesitate to sell their souls and, with unparalleled shamelessness, begged for financial and economic aid from the U.S. imperialists' lackey, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. They rallied a small group of followers, deceived some people who were unaware of the truth, and staged the farce of the fake "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference."

	From the very beginning, this illegal conference exposed the Soviet revisionists' traitorous face of colluding with the U.S. against China. During the five-day splitist conference, the Soviet revisionists engaged in extensive anti-China activities, directly targeting China, and did their utmost in slander and rumor-mongering. The "General Declaration" drafted and finalized by the Soviet revisionists for the fake "Third Conference" maliciously attacked China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, claiming that "isolating one country's culture from the general ranks and expelling it and defaming other countries' cultures will ultimately lead to shameful racism and fall into the trap of the most vicious enemies of humanity, the imperialists and colonialists." On the day the fake "Third Conference" opened, Chugunov, Secretary of the Soviet Afro-Asian Writers' Liaison Committee, shamelessly spouted in Lebanon's *An-Nahar* newspaper to incite the conference against China, falsely accusing China's firm stand of opposing U.S.-led imperialism and old and new colonialism and resolutely supporting the liberation struggles of the Afro-Asian peoples as an attempt to "make the Afro-Asian literary movement serve its (China's) narrow political purposes and interests." To evade the world's condemnation of their treacherous acts and to frame the great Chinese people with false charges, the Soviet revisionists even published in the Soviet *Izvestia* newspaper a commentary on the opening of the splitist conference, openly slandering China as "colluding with imperialists to spread discord and split the national liberation forces." The Soviet revisionists' blatant anti-China activities do not harm the great Chinese people in the slightest but only further expose the Soviet revisionist leadership's role as U.S. imperialism's henchmen.

	Under the direct control of the Soviet revisionists, this splitist conference fully exposed the Soviet revisionist leadership's role as U.S. imperialism's henchmen on the issues of Vietnam and Palestine. The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression for national salvation and the Palestinian people's just struggle against U.S. lackey Israel for the right of return have won the support of revolutionary peoples and progressive writers in various Asian and African countries. However, the "General Report" at the beginning and the "General Declaration" at the end of the fake "Third Conference," as well as the speeches of the Soviet representatives, avoided discussing the essence of the anti-imperialist struggles of the Vietnamese and Palestinian peoples and dared not condemn U.S. imperialism's aggressive crimes. On the issue of Vietnam, the Soviet revisionists did not mention the Four-Point Proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Five-Point Declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam but advocated "immediate cessation of barbaric bombing and the gradual escalation of U.S. aggression in Vietnam" to serve the U.S. aggressors' counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy of "bombing pause and deception" in Vietnam. On the issue of Palestine, the Soviet representative attempted to downplay the importance of this issue and was strongly opposed by the representatives of Arab countries. The Soviet representative absurdly claimed that they had not studied the Palestinian issue and that they were only interested in literature and poetry but not in politics. The representatives of Palestine and other Arab countries refuted this absurd argument at the conference and posed questions, leaving the Soviet representative speechless. In fact, the Soviet revisionists' intention was clear: they wanted to peddle the so-called "Tashkent spirit" to the Middle East, to make Arabs "coexist peacefully" with Israel, and to allow the U.S. imperialists' claws to spread freely in this region. The Soviet revisionists' schemes once again provided valuable "negative examples" for the revolutionary peoples.

	The Soviet revisionists used this conference to peddle their broken goods of Sino-Soviet cooperation and advocate the revisionist line of capitulation. Yevtushenko, the Soviet "poet" who had once laid a wreath for the deceased U.S. imperialist leader Kennedy, was a member of the Soviet delegation to the fake "Third Conference." This infamous revisionist "poet" was used by the Soviet revisionists as a black flag to deceive Afro-Asian writers. He shamelessly said, "We have abandoned Kipling's famous dictum that the East is the East and the West is the West, and never the twain shall meet, because now the West is no longer the West of the past, and the East is no longer the East of the past. When they come closer to each other, they have already merged." These words fully exposed the Soviet revisionists' traitorous face and were a confession of their orchestration of the fake "Third Conference." The Soviet representatives also desperately advocated so-called humanitarianism in literature at the conference, using the pretext of discussing literature to peddle their line of capitulation to U.S. imperialism, to sedate the Afro-Asian peoples, and to sabotage the Afro-Asian peoples' anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles.

	This splitist conference was a complete mess, with chaos both inside and outside. The conference discriminated against some African delegations, and the agenda and speaking order were not consulted with the African delegations. According to Lebanese newspapers, some African delegations protested. An African representative said, "I protest! I am not a child. Up to now, I still do not know what issues the conference will discuss and why I am here." Laughter and conversations in the venue often drowned out the speakers' voices. People came and went as if they were in a club. In the latter half of the conference, there were more people in the lounge than in the venue. The Soviet "poet" Yevtushenko was particularly disgraceful. He left the venue only 20 minutes after the opening ceremony because he had drunk two bottles of champagne the night before and was not sober when he attended the opening ceremony. The Lebanese newspaper *Al-Yawm* commented, "People privately said that this conference was wrong from the start, and no one should be surprised at its outcome." Some people said, "This is not like a writers' conference at all, but like being in a theater." Some Lebanese writers and masses told the Xinhua News Agency correspondent, "This is truly a fake writers' conference. Holding such a conference in our capital makes us feel ashamed." Some people said, "Today, the true center of the world revolution is in Beijing. We will go to participate in the genuine Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing this year."

	Despite the Soviet revisionists' shameless attacks on China and the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Secretary-General Senanayake and Afro-Asian revolutionary writers before and during the conference, it was they who were truly isolated. Many Afro-Asian revolutionary writers saw through the Soviet revisionists' traitorous face and boycotted this splitist conference. Writers from Tanzania, Mali, Guinea, Congo (Brazzaville), Pakistan, and Cambodia did not attend this conference. The total number of attendees was only over a hundred, and the Soviet Union and a few other delegations accounted for more than half of this number. Among these people, many were Soviet puppets and were not writers at all. This situation shows that the conference, which the Soviet revisionists struggled to convene with great effort, was extremely unpopular.

	The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, taught, "To create disorder, fail, create disorder again, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The Soviet revisionists, like imperialism and all reactionaries in the world, will never deviate from this logic pointed out by Chairman Mao. The illegal convening of the fake "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" has further exposed the reactionary nature of the Soviet revisionists to the Afro-Asian revolutionary writers and peoples, thoroughly exposing their evil intentions of splitting the Afro-Asian writers' movement and sabotaging the Afro-Asian peoples' united struggle against imperialism. The Soviet revisionists have once again lifted a stone to drop it on their own feet.

	The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau announced in its statement on March 21 that the preparations for the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing this year are proceeding satisfactorily. The Chinese Writers' Association solemnly announced in its statement on March 24, "As the host, the Chinese writers will contribute their utmost to ensure the successful convening of the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference."

	Many writers' associations and nationalist parties in various Asian and African countries have also issued statements, firmly supporting the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing this year. The revolutionary peoples of various Asian and African countries are confident that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will be a reliable guarantee for the success of this conference to be held in Beijing. The revolutionary writers of Asia and Africa will raise the banner of unity against imperialism even higher, with a high combat posture, and resolutely and thoroughly smash the Soviet revisionists' splitist and capitulationist line, making greater contributions to the cause of Afro-Asian peoples' unity against imperialism!

    苏修集团非法召开亚非作家伪“三大”再次搬起石头砸自己的脚
    苏修公开投靠美帝彻底暴露叛徒面目
    亚非革命作家决心粉碎苏修投降路线
    新华社三日讯　贝鲁特消息：苏联修正主义领导集团不顾亚非作家常设局以及几十个亚非国家的革命作家组织和民族主义政党的强烈谴责和警告，于三月二十五日到二十九日在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特强行召开了伪“第三届亚非作家大会”。苏修一手策划的这次分裂会议彻底暴露了他们公开投靠美帝，公开破坏亚非作家运动和亚非人民团结反帝的革命事业，决心同亚非人民和亚非广大的革命、进步作家为敌到底。这是苏修领导集团继二月间在尼科西亚非法召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会后，对亚非革命人民犯下的又一个新的严重罪行。
    早在去年六月，在总部设在科伦坡的亚非作家常设局主持下，在北京举行了有五十三个亚非国家和地区的作家代表参加的亚非作家紧急会议，会议决定今年在北京召开第三届亚非作家大会。苏联修正主义者十分害怕这一会议将在轰轰烈烈开展着史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的中国首都北京召开，十分害怕亚非作家运动在这次会议以后将更高地举起反对以美国为首的帝国主义、支持亚非人民革命斗争的大旗，十分害怕他们的投降妥协的路线将遭到更彻底的破产。在这种情况下，他们不惜出卖灵魂，竟厚颜无耻地向美帝的御用工具联合国教育、科学及文化组织乞讨财经援助，纠集一小撮追随者，欺骗了一些不明真相的人，一手导演了伪“第三届亚非作家大会”的丑剧。
    这次非法会议从一开始就暴露了苏修的联美反华的叛徒面目。在历时五天的分裂会议期间，苏修大搞反华活动，矛头直接指向中国，干尽了诬蔑造谣之能事。由苏修定调和定稿的伪“三大”的“总宣言”恶毒影射攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命，胡说什么“把一国文化同总的队伍隔离开来，把它开除出去并糟塌别国的文化”，“最终将导致可耻的种族主义”，并“落入人类最凶恶的敌人帝国主义分子和殖民主义分子的圈套”。在伪“三大”开幕的那天，苏联亚非作家联络委员会书记丘古诺夫为了煽动会议反华，在黎巴嫩的《安瓦尔报》上无耻地大放厥词，把中国人民坚定不移地反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义、坚决支持亚非人民解放斗争的正确立场说成是什么“企图使亚非文学家运动为它（中国）的狭隘政治目的和利益服务”。为了逃避世界舆论对他们的叛卖行径的谴责，为了把莫须有的罪名强加在伟大的中国人民头上，苏联修正主义者竟在苏联《消息报》上就分裂会议开幕发表评论，公开诬蔑中国“同帝国主义者散布不和、分裂民族解放力量的作法串通一气”。苏修这种明目张胆的反华活动，无损于伟大的中国人民的一根毫毛，而只能进一步暴露苏修领导集团充当美帝帮凶的狰狞面目。
    在苏修直接控制下的这个分裂会议上，苏联修正主义领导集团充当美帝国主义帮凶的叛徒面目在越南问题和巴勒斯坦问题上也充分地暴露了出来。英勇的越南人民的抗美救国斗争和巴勒斯坦人民反对美帝工具以色列、争取重返家园的正义斗争得到了亚非各国革命人民和进步作家的支持。但是伪“三大”开始时的“总报告”和结束时的“总宣言”以及苏联代表的发言，避而不谈越南和巴勒斯坦人民的反帝斗争的实质，不敢谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行。在越南问题上，苏联修正主义者只字不提越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，却鼓吹什么“立即停止在越南的野蛮轰炸和美国侵略的逐步升级”，来为美国侵略者在越南推行“停炸诱和”的反革命两手策略服务。在巴勒斯坦问题上，苏联代表企图冲淡这一问题的重要性，遭到了阿拉伯国家代表的强烈反对。苏联代表胡说什么他们没有研究过巴勒斯坦问题，他们只对文学和诗歌感兴趣，而对政治不感兴趣。巴勒斯坦等阿拉伯国家的代表在会上驳斥了这种荒唐谬论，并提出质问，把苏联代表问得无言以对。其实，苏修的企图是一清二楚的，它们要把所谓的塔什干精神贩卖到中东去，要阿拉伯人同以色列“和平共处”，让美帝的魔爪自由自在地在这一地区伸展。苏修的这些勾当，再一次给革命人民提供了有益的“反面教员”的材料。
    苏联修正主义者利用这次会议大肆贩卖苏美合作的破烂货，鼓吹修正主义投降路线。曾为死去的美帝国主义头子肯尼迪的幽灵献过花圈的苏联阿飞“诗人”叶夫图申科是苏联出席伪“三大”的代表团团员。这个臭名远扬的修正主义“诗人”在伪“三大”上被苏修当作一面黑旗来向亚非作家招摇撞骗。他无耻地说：“我们摈弃了吉卜龄的有名论断——东方就是东方，西方就是西方，两者决不会合到一起——因为，现在西方已不是过去的西方，东方也不象过去的东方。当两者互相接近的时候，它们就已经合到一起了。”这席话把苏修的叛徒嘴脸暴露无遗，是苏修策划伪“三大”的自白书。苏联代表还在会上拚命鼓吹文学中的所谓人道主义，玩弄以谈文学为幌子的手法，来贩卖他们向美帝投降的路线，麻醉亚非人民，破坏亚非人民的反帝反殖斗争。
    这次分裂会议开得很不象样，会内会外一片混乱。会议歧视一些非洲代表团，会议日程和发言顺序没有征求非洲代表团的意见。据黎巴嫩报纸报道，有的非洲代表团因此提出了抗议。有一个非洲代表说：“我抗议！我不是小孩子。迄今我还不知道大会将要讨论什么问题和我在这里的原因。”在会场上笑声和谈话声往往比发言人的声音还要响，人们就象在俱乐部一样，时出时进，在会议后半截，呆在休息室的人比在会场上的人还要多。苏联阿飞“诗人”叶夫图申科更是丑态百出。他参加开幕式只二十分钟就离开了会议厅，因为前一天晚上他喝了两瓶香槟酒，参加开幕式时还没有清醒过来。黎巴嫩报纸《今日报》评论说：“人们私下议论说，这次大会一开始就错了，谁都不应该对它的结果感到意外。”有些人说：“这根本不象作家会议，而是象在戏院里。”黎巴嫩有的作家和群众对新华社记者说：“这真正是伪作家大会，在我国首都举行这种大会，使我们感到羞耻。”有的人说：“今天真正的世界革命中心是在北京。我们要去参加今年在北京举行的真正的第三届亚非作家大会。”
    尽管苏修在会前和会议期间无耻地攻击中国，攻击亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克和亚非的革命作家，但是真正遭到孤立的却是它们自己。许多亚非革命作家识破了苏联修正主义者的叛徒面目，抵制了这次分裂会议。坦桑尼亚、马里、几内亚、刚果（布）、巴基斯坦和柬埔寨等国家的作家没有出席这次会议。出席会议的人数总共只有一百多人，而苏联和其它几个代表团就占了这个总数的半数以上。在这些人中间，不少人是苏联的傀儡，根本不是什么作家。这一情况表明，由苏修花了九牛二虎之力拼凑召开的这一会议，是非常不得人心的。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”苏联修正主义者同帝国主义和世界上一切反动派一样，也决不会违背毛主席所指出的这个逻辑的。伪“第三届亚非作家大会”的非法召开，恰恰在亚非革命作家和人民面前进一步暴露了苏修的反动本性，彻底戳穿了它们分裂亚非作家运动，破坏亚非人民团结反帝事业的罪恶目的。苏联修正主义者再一次搬起了石头打了自己的脚。
    亚非作家常设局在三月二十一日的声明中已经宣布：为今年内将在北京召开的第三届亚非作家大会的筹备工作，正在令人满意地进行。中国作家协会在三月二十四日的声明中也郑重宣布：“作为东道主的中国作家，将为第三届亚非作家大会的胜利召开而贡献自己的最大力量。”
    许多亚非国家的作家协会和民族主义政党也已纷纷发表声明，坚决支持今年在北京召开的第三届亚非作家大会。亚非各国的革命人民坚信：中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，将是在北京举行的这一大会取得成功的可靠保证。亚非的革命作家将更高地举起团结反帝的旗帜，以高度的战斗姿态，坚决彻底地粉碎苏修分裂主义者的投降路线，为亚非人民团结反帝事业作出更大的贡献！
