The PLA in Shanghai Uses Great Mao Zedong Thought to Support the Industrial and Transportation Front, Achieving Great Results

Revolutionary victories are being won one after another, and production is surging ahead.

According to a report by our correspondent from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on the 18th, the PLA units stationed in Shanghai have enthusiastically responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to actively support the broad leftist masses and vigorously support local industrial production work. They have sent large numbers of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams into factories, enterprises, and transportation departments, vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought to revolutionary workers. With the help of the PLA soldiers, a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works has emerged within the Shanghai industrial and transportation system, unprecedented in history. The ideological revolution of the broad masses of workers and revolutionary cadres has been further deepened, and both revolution and production present a vibrant and flourishing situation.

At this critical moment when the proletarian revolutionary factions on the Shanghai industrial and transportation front are high-spiritedly raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to achieve decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army, personally led by the great leader Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, has brought Mao Zedong Thought to the proletarian revolutionary factions on the Shanghai industrial and transportation front. They have brought the political work experience of the PLA and the fine traditions of "four firsts" and "three-eights" spirit. The proletarian revolutionary factions on the Shanghai industrial and transportation front have further clarified their direction of advance through learning from the PLA: factories and enterprises should take the PLA as a model, forever raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought like the PLA; they should emphasize politics, prioritize revolution, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything; they should train a revolutionary force that is highly proletarian and highly combative, like the PLA. This not only has great strategic significance for carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Shanghai industrial and transportation system but will also have a profound impact on the revolutionary construction of this largest industrial base in our country.

Since mid-February, the PLA units stationed in Shanghai have formed more than 200 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which have gone deep into factories in the metallurgy, chemical, machinery, electricity, instrumentation, and textile industries in Shanghai, as well as into railway, port, and dock transportation hubs. They have held large and small meetings in workshops, docks, dormitories, and canteens, had individual talks with workers, and used various propaganda tools and methods to vigorously and enthusiastically promote Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's latest instructions, Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in All Factories and Mines Across the Country." The broad masses of proletarian revolutionary factions on the Shanghai industrial and transportation front have warmly welcomed the arrival of the PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They have praised the PLA for bringing Chairman Mao's latest instructions to their doorstep and doing political and ideological work among the people. They regard the PLA's support as the greatest concern and encouragement from the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao for the revolutionary workers in the Shanghai industrial and transportation system. They have resolutely declared that they will read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They will strive to be the six exemplary figures called for by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

After the signal to launch a general offensive against the number one capitalist-roader in the Party was sounded, the soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and the revolutionary workers in Shanghai factories, enterprises, and transportation departments, with boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and with boundless contempt and hatred for China's Khrushchev, have denounced his long-standing anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought actions. They have exposed his heinous crimes of promoting counter-revolutionary revisionism and attempting to restore capitalism. Some PLA soldiers have also joined revolutionary workers to use the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly refute the poisonous weed "On Cultivation" by this number one capitalist-roader in the Party and his other various counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies. The mass criticism movement has further aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of revolutionary workers and cadres, promoting the further development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Thousands of supports, tens of thousands of supports, arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest and most fundamental support. The broad masses of soldiers in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have faithfully followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "Wherever you go, blend with the local masses, do not stand above them, but immerse yourself among them; according to the level of awareness of the masses, enlighten and raise their awareness." Whether it is problems in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution or production problems, they always give Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's instructions to the worker masses. They firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit, allowing the masses to educate themselves and liberate themselves. Chairman Mao's words have the highest authority and the greatest power. Revolutionary masses welcome them the most, and class enemies fear them the most. The broad masses of revolutionary workers have a deep class sentiment for Mao Zedong Thought. Once they grasp Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, their spiritual power quickly turns into a great material force, solving all problems.

The People's Liberation Army is most loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and most hates the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. Their clear political stance has greatly educated the proletarian revolutionary factions in Shanghai. After the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams went deep into the grassroots, they found that some factories and enterprises were influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line in personnel issues, which was characterized by "striking a large area and protecting a small clique." They enthusiastically promoted Chairman Mao's personnel policies to the worker masses and, together with the worker masses, criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminated its poison, and greatly promoted the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in Shanghai factories, enterprises, and transportation departments. In the Shanghai Flour Mill, the proletarian revolutionary factions were very energetic but did not pay enough attention to uniting the majority of the masses and the majority of the cadres. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team in this mill vigorously promoted the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's personnel policies to the worker masses, criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, and sincerely helped the proletarian revolutionary factions correctly treat the masses deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line and correctly treat the cadres. With the help of the PLA soldiers, the proletarian revolutionary factions in this mill quickly united the majority of the masses. Revolutionary faction workers, with the help of the soldiers, conducted a class analysis of all the cadres in the mill, patiently helped the cadres who had made mistakes to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down the "self" and establish the "public," dispel their worries, go to the masses, and go to the fiery struggle to correct their mistakes and make amends. In this way, the entire mill quickly achieved the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions and established a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ—the Revolutionary Committee, which unified the leadership of the entire mill's revolution and production. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and workers was greatly unleashed, making the revolution vigorous and production better month by month.

How to emphasize politics and turn factories and enterprises into red Mao Zedong Thought schools? This is a new topic facing the proletarian revolutionary factions after they take power. The People's Liberation Army, with its glorious revolutionary traditions, has brought the political work experience personally cultivated by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as well as the fine revolutionary traditions and styles of the "four firsts" and "three-eights," into the factories, setting a good example for the proletarian revolutionary factions. After the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team arrived at the Shanghai Radio Equipment Factory, based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," they enthusiastically helped the proletarian revolutionary factions overcome the phenomenon of being busy with routine work, always putting the study of Chairman Mao's works first, and established and improved the study system. The entire factory quickly presented a new situation of acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions and leading production with revolution.

With the strong support and help of the PLA soldiers, the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the Shanghai industrial and transportation system have been greatly enhanced, and their combat effectiveness has been greatly improved, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire industrial and transportation system to a more in-depth new stage. Many industrial and transportation departments have quickly established "grasp revolution, promote production" frontline command posts and established a good new order for revolution and production. Spiritual power has been transformed into a great material force, and the production of various factories and enterprises is surging ahead. The total industrial output value for the first quarter has increased compared to the same period last year, and many departments have created unprecedented new achievements of high quality and high yield.

    上海驻军用伟大毛泽东思想支援工交战线取得巨大成果
    革命节节胜利　生产蒸蒸日上
    解放军宣传队和革命职工一起，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大毒草《修养》，进一步激发了职工的革命热情，推动了文化大革命的深入发展。
    据新华社上海十八日电　本社记者报道：人民解放军驻上海陆海空军部队，热烈响应伟大统帅毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众和大力支持地方工业生产工作的号召，派出大批毛泽东思想宣传队深入工厂企业、交通运输部门，大张旗鼓地向革命职工热情宣传毛泽东思想。在解放军指战员们的帮助下，上海工业交通系统内已经出现了一个前所未有的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动的新高潮，广大职工群众和革命干部的思想进一步革命化，革命和生产都呈现出一派热气腾腾的大好形势。
    正当上海工交战线无产阶级革命派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命决定性胜利的关键时刻，由伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造、林彪副主席亲自领导的举世无双的中国人民解放军，给上海工交战线的无产阶级革命派传播了毛泽东思想，送来了解放军的政治工作经验，送来了“四个第一”、“三八作风”的优良传统。上海工交战线的无产阶级革命派，也在大学解放军中进一步明确了前进的方向：工厂企业就是要以解放军为样板，象解放军那样永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗；就是要象解放军那样突出政治，把革命放在首位，以毛泽东思想统帅一切；就是要带出一支象解放军那样非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命队伍。这不仅对搞好上海工交系统的无产阶级文化大革命具有重大的战略意义，而且必将对我国这个最大的工业基地的革命化建设，产生极为深远的影响。
    人民解放军驻上海陆海空三军的指战员，从二月中旬开始，先后组成二百多个毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到上海冶金、化工、机械、电业、仪表、纺织等行业的工厂，深入到铁路、港口、码头等交通枢纽，在车间、码头、宿舍、食堂，到处召开大会、座谈会，同职工个别谈心，并且运用各种宣传工具和宣传形式，大张旗鼓地、满腔热情地把毛泽东思想，把毛主席的最新指示，把毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》，原原本本地向职工群众进行广泛深入的宣传。上海工业交通战线广大无产阶级革命派，最热烈地欢迎解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的到来。他们以无比崇敬的心情赞扬解放军把毛主席的最新指示送上门，把政治思想工作做到人。他们把解放军的支持，看作是最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席对上海工交系统革命职工的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，坚决表示要一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，争做毛主席和党中央所号召的六个模范，挑好革命、生产两副重担。
    在向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的号角吹响以后，毛泽东思想宣传队的指战员和上海工厂企业、交通运输部门的革命职工一起，怀着对毛主席和毛泽东思想的无比热爱、无比崇敬；怀着对中国的赫鲁晓夫的无比蔑视、无比仇恨，声讨他一贯反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想，推行反革命修正主义，妄图实行资本主义复辟的滔天罪行。一些解放军指战员还和革命职工一起，以光芒万丈的毛泽东思想为武器，把这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的《修养》这株大毒草和他的其他种种反革命修正主义谬论，批驳得体无完肤。群众性的大批判运动，进一步激发了广大革命职工和革命干部的革命热情，推动了无产阶级文化大革命的进一步深入发展。
    千支援，万支援，用毛泽东思想武装群众是最大的支援，最根本的支援。毛泽东思想宣传队的广大指战员，忠实地遵循毛主席“每到一地，就和那里的群众打成一片，不是高踞于群众之上，而是深入于群众之中；根据群众的觉悟程度，去启发和提高群众的觉悟”的教导，不论遇到无产阶级文化大革命中的问题，还是生产中的问题，都是把毛泽东思想，把毛主席的指示交给职工群众，坚定不移地相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。毛主席的话威信最高，威力最大，革命群众最欢迎，阶级敌人最害怕。广大革命职工对毛泽东思想有无比深厚的阶级感情，一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，掌握了党的方针政策，精神力量就迅速变成巨大的物质力量，什么问题都能迎刃而解。
    人民解放军最忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，最痛恨以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线。他们爱憎分明的政治立场，使上海的无产阶级革命派受到很大教育。毛泽东思想宣传队深入基层以后，发现有些工厂企业里存在着“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线的影响。他们就向职工群众热情宣传毛主席的干部政策，和职工群众一道批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的流毒，极大地促进了上海工厂企业和交通运输部门实行革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。在上海面粉厂里，无产阶级革命派闯劲很足，但是没有能很好注意团结大多数的群众和大多数的干部。在这个厂的毛泽东思想宣传队，大力向职工群众宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和毛主席的干部政策，批判资产阶级反动路线，热诚帮助无产阶级革命派正确地对待受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众和正确地对待干部。在解放军指战员的帮助下，这个厂的无产阶级革命派较快地团结了大多数群众。革命派职工还在指战员们的帮助下，对全厂干部作了阶级分析，耐心帮助犯了错误的干部活学活用毛主席著作，大破私字，大立公字，打消顾虑，到群众中去，到火热的斗争中去改正错误，将功补过。这样，全厂很快实现了无产阶级革命派的大联合，建立了革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的“三结合”临时权力机构——革命委员会，统一领导全厂的革命和生产。广大干部、群众的革命积极性大发扬，革命搞得生气勃勃，生产一月比一月好。
    怎样突出政治，把工厂企业办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校？这是无产阶级革命派掌权以后面临的新课题。具有光荣革命传统的中国人民解放军，把毛主席和林彪副主席亲自培养起来的政治工作经验和“四个第一”、“三八作风”等优良革命传统和作风带进工厂，为无产阶级革命派树立了良好的榜样。毛泽东思想宣传队来到上海广播器材厂以后，根据毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，热情地帮助无产阶级革命派组织克服了忙于事务性工作的现象，处处把学习毛主席著作放在首位，建立和健全了学习制度。全厂很快出现了按照毛主席指示办事、以革命统帅生产的新局面。
    在解放军指战员的有力支持和帮助下，上海工交系统无产阶级革命派的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性大大增强，战斗力大大提高，把整个工交系统的无产阶级文化大革命推进到了一个更加深入的新阶段。许多工交部门，迅速建立了“抓革命，促生产”的第一线指挥部，建立了良好的革命和生产的新秩序。精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量，各工厂企业的生产蒸蒸日上。第一季度工业生产总产值比去年同期有所增长，许多部门还创造了前所未有的优质高产的新成就。
