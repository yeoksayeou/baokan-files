Workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and revolutionary cadres, comrades, and Red Guards:

	Hello! On behalf of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, I warmly congratulate the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee! I salute you all with the revolutionary greetings of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	The establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee marks a new victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing and will have a significant impact on the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country. After holding the Workers' Congress, the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Congress, the University Red Guards' Congress, and the Middle School Red Guards' Congress, the proletarian revolutionary forces in Beijing have further united and achieved revolutionary "three-in-one combination." This is a great victory for the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao.

	Comrade Xie Fuzhi's speech was excellent. I would like to discuss two issues: one is the relationship between the Great Criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation within each unit, and the other is the issue of supporting the army and loving the people.

	The overall situation in the country is good. This good situation is the result of our struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the result of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces, and also the result of the great support of the People's Liberation Army.

	However, the development of the situation is uneven and has fluctuations. This is a normal phenomenon. Absolutely balanced situations do not exist in the world. Without fluctuations, it is a rare occurrence. Through repeated struggles, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the Cultural Revolution have repeatedly competed and fought, which has tempered us. Without fluctuations, how can we be tempered? Fluctuations are not a bad thing.

	In the current stage of the proletarian revolutionary forces uniting to seize power, we should launch a movement to criticize the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and at the same time, according to the different situations in various places, gradually shift to the struggle, criticism, and transformation within each unit. This task is arduous.

	The biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party are the representatives of the restoration of capitalism and the backers of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in Beijing. For seventeen years, they have advocated and stubbornly adhered to a bourgeois reactionary line in all aspects. The revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao has developed through the struggle against this bourgeois reactionary line. We must thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line in the political, economic, ideological, and cultural fronts and plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in every battlefield.

	The struggle, criticism, and transformation within each unit and the criticism of the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party are not contradictory and can be unified. The criticism of the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party can strongly promote the struggle, criticism, and transformation within each unit. While the struggle, criticism, and transformation within each unit can more fully expose and more deeply criticize the poisons spread by the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party on various fronts. This requires us to think carefully, study Chairman Mao's works well, and do a good job of investigation and research. We need to be calm and able to sit down and discuss, rather than arguing every day, let alone fighting.

	This is an extremely important task. To complete this task, each unit needs to establish a revolutionary leadership organization. Of course, some units where the Party leadership and administrative leadership are basically good do not need to seize power. However, almost all units need to achieve revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" to establish a temporary power organization for the unit. If there is no revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," how can you struggle, criticize, and transform? Who will lead?

	Comrades, have you thought about this issue? Some students only think about going to one place to link up and another place to charge, with great enthusiasm. However, doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit and department is the basic work of socialist revolution and socialist construction. It is a long-term plan! If you think about it this way, it will increase comrades' sense of responsibility!

	Our Central Cultural Revolution Group will also do in-depth investigation and research work. We will learn from comrades' good experiences and then help comrades.

	We have been comrades-in-arms sharing hardships and joys for the past year. I hope that in the issue of struggle, criticism, and transformation, comrades will think carefully. Do not shift the focus of the struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. We must refute them thoroughly and practically. The former Beijing Municipal Committee, the former Propaganda Department, the former Cultural Department, and other counter-revolutionary revisionist elements must be further exposed and criticized.

	Since Chairman Mao's instructions and Comrade Lin Biao's firm support, the five tasks of supporting the left, supporting work, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training have been carried out. The People's Liberation Army has invested a large amount of manpower, and cadres and soldiers have done tremendous work, achieving initial brilliant results.

	Regarding the army, no matter who it is, if you have any opinions, you can write big-character posters and small-character posters and send them to the person himself, or you can reflect them to the superiors or even the Central Committee. However, the struggle's target must not be directed at the army.

	Revolutionary masses should correctly treat the army and support it. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a people's army, people have nothing." The Central Military Commission's eight orders on January 28 are correct and effective. The main aspect of the eight orders is to talk about how the masses should correctly treat the People's Liberation Army, which is about supporting the army.

	The army should also correctly treat the masses and love the people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The army must blend with the masses, so that the army is seen as their own army in the eyes of the masses. Such an army is invincible in the world." Now, the Central Military Commission's ten orders on April 6 are also correct and effective. The main aspect of the ten orders is to talk about how the People's Liberation Army should correctly treat the masses, which is about loving the people.

	The spirit of the eight orders and the ten orders is consistent. It is wrong to oppose the ten orders with the eight orders. Do not use the ten orders to destroy the eight orders. If you use the ten orders to destroy the eight orders, you are wrong. We raise this issue because we are afraid that comrades will make mistakes and that bad elements will take advantage of it. Therefore, we now specially emphasize the call to support the army and love the people.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "In front of us, there are two kinds of social contradictions, that is, the contradiction between the enemy and us and the contradiction within the people.... The nature of these two kinds of contradictions is different, and the methods of resolution are also different. In simple terms, the former is the issue of distinguishing between the enemy and us, and the latter is the issue of distinguishing right from wrong."

	We should be good at distinguishing between the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions within the people and should not confuse the two kinds of contradictions. For the contradictions within the people, including the debates among various mass organizations, we should use the method of presenting facts and reasoning, and the policy of unity-criticism-unity to correctly handle them, and we should not label some organizations and masses with different opinions as counter-revolutionaries. We should not use the method of handling the contradictions between the enemy and us to handle the problems among mass organizations. We must not engage in armed struggles.

	Comrades, we hope that the broad revolutionary masses in Beijing, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great unity in the revolutionary great criticism, and build Beijing into a big school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

	Let us shout:
	Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
	Long live the Red Guards!
	Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!
	Long live the Communist Party of China!
	Long live Mao Zedong Thought!
	Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

    在北京市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会上
    江青同志的讲话
    新华社二十日讯　江青同志在北京市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会上的讲话工、农、兵、学、革命干部同志们，战友们，红卫兵小将们：
    你们好！我代表中央文化革命小组，热烈祝贺北京市革命委员会的成立！向同志们致无产阶级文化大革命战斗的敬礼！
    北京市革命委员会的建立，标志着北京市无产阶级文化大革命取得了新的胜利，并将对全国各地无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，起着重大的影响。在召开了工人代表会议、贫下中农代表会议、大学红卫兵代表会议、中学红卫兵代表会议以后，北京的无产阶级革命派进一步联合起来，实现了革命的“三结合”。这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    谢富治同志的讲话很好。我只想讲两个问题：一个是大批判和本单位斗、批、改的关系问题，一个是拥军爱民的问题。
    目前全国的形势，总的方面说来是很好的，是大好的。这个大好形势是毛主席领导着我们斗争的结果，是无产阶级革命派大联合的结果，也是伟大的人民解放军支持的结果。
    但是形势的发展是不平衡的，是有反复的。这是正常的现象。绝对平衡的事情，世界上是不存在的。没有反复，那是很少的事情。经过反复的较量，无产阶级同资产阶级在文化大革命中反复的较量、搏斗，才能锻炼我们。没有反复，怎么能锻炼我们。反复，不是坏事。
    在当前无产阶级革命派联合夺权的这个阶段中，应该开展对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动，同时，按各地不同的情况，逐步地转入本单位的斗批改。这个任务是艰巨的。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是资本主义复辟的代表，是北京市反革命修正主义集团的后台，十七年来，他们在各个方面，提出了并且顽固地坚持了一条资产阶级反动路线。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就是同这条资产阶级反动路线斗争中发展起来的。我们要在政治、经济、思想、文化各条战线上，彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍各个阵地。
    本单位的斗批改，和对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的批判工作，是不矛盾的，是可以统一的。对党内最大的少数走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，可以有力地带动各单位的斗、批、改。而各单位的斗、批、改，又可以更充分地揭露、更深入地批判党内的最大的走资本主义道路的当权派在各个战线上散布的毒素。这就要动脑筋，好好地想一想。要好好地学习毛主席著作，好好地做调查工作、研究工作。就需要冷静，能够坐到板凳上去商量商量，而不是天天吵嘴，更不是动起拳头打架。
    这是极其重要的任务。为了完成这个任务，每个单位，都需要建立革命的领导机构。当然，也有的单位，党的领导、行政领导基本上还好，就不必去夺权了。但是，差不多的单位都要搞革命的大联合，都要搞革命的“三结合”，建立本单位的临时权力机构。如果没有革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”，你如何去斗批改？谁领导？对不对？
    同志们想了这个问题没有？有的同学，只想到这里去串串，到那里去冲冲，那个劲头大。但是，搞好本单位、本部门的斗批改，这是社会主义革命、社会主义建设的基本功。是百年大计！这样想一想，就会增加同志们的责任感！
    我们中央文化革命小组，也要作深入的调查研究工作。和同志们一块，学习同志们好的经验，然后再来帮助同志们。
    我们这一年来是共患难、同甘苦的战友。我希望在斗批改这个问题上，同志们好好地想一想。不要转移了对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争。要踏踏实实的驳倒他们。对旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，也必须进一步深入地进行揭发和批判。
    自从毛主席指示、林彪同志坚决支持，支左、支工、支农、军管、军训这五项工作，人民解放军投入了大量的力量，干部、战士做了巨大的工作，取得了辉煌的初步的成绩。
    对军队，不管是谁，有意见完全可以写大字报、小字报，送给他本人，也可以向上级甚至中央反映。但是，绝不能把斗争的矛头指向军队。
    革命群众要正确地对待军队，要拥军。毛主席教导我们说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”一月二十八号中央军委的八条命令是正确的，有效的。八条命令的主要方面，是讲群众应当怎样正确地对待人民解放军，是讲拥军的。
    军队也要正确地对待群众，要爱民。毛主席教导我们说：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”。现在，四月六日中央军委的十条命令，也是正确的，有效的。十条命令的主要方面，是讲人民解放军应当怎样正确地对待群众，是讲爱民的。
    八条命令和十条命令的精神，是一致的。把十条命令和八条命令对立起来，是不对的，绝不要利用这个十条命令去破坏那个八条命令。如果用这个十条命令去破坏那个八条命令，那就错啦。我们提出这个问题，一个是怕同志们犯错误，另外怕坏人利用。因此，我们现在特别强调地提出拥军爱民的号召。
    毛主席教导我们说：“在我们的面前有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。……敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同。简单地说起来，前者是分清敌我的问题，后者是分清是非的问题。”
    我们要善于区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，不能混淆两类矛盾。对于人民内部矛盾，包括各个群众组织之间的争论，要用摆事实，讲道理的方法，用团结——批评——团结的方针，去正确地处理，不能把一些持有不同意见的组织和群众打成反革命，不能用处理敌我矛盾的方法，来处理群众组织之间的问题。更不要武斗。
    同志们，我们希望，北京市的广大革命群众，在北京市革命委员会的领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在革命的大批判中，巩固和发展革命的大联合，把北京市建设成为一个活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。
    让我们高呼：
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    红卫兵万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛泽东思想万岁！
    毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
