	Warning to the Reactionary Government of Australia

	Recently, the various lackeys of American imperialism in Asia have been colluding and actively working to help the United States form an anti-China encirclement. At this very moment, Australian Prime Minister Holt has also come to Asia and, following in the footsteps of Thai Prime Minister Thanom, has arrived in Taiwan to openly conspire with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

	The reactionary government of Holt sent its foreign minister to "visit" Taiwan last year, and subsequently dispatched an "ambassador" to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Now, Holt himself has gone to Taiwan to engage in conspiratorial activities. This is a provocation against the Chinese people and a provocation against the peoples of Asia.

	The reactionary government of Australia has long followed the policy of American imperialism in invading Asia. Since Holt took office in January of last year, he has become even more blatant in his alignment with American imperialism. Not only has he opened the doors wide for American monopolistic capital to infiltrate Australia and allowed the United States to establish military bases in Australia, but he has also actively supported and participated in the American imperialist strategy of shifting its focus eastward, encircling China, and invading Vietnam, becoming a capable henchman of American imperialism.

	The Holt reactionary government is also a accomplice in the American imperialist invasion of Vietnam. Despite strong opposition from the Australian people, it has increased the number of Australian mercenary troops invading South Vietnam from over a thousand to over six thousand, and has also sent a squadron of bombers and a missile destroyer to participate in the massacre of the Vietnamese people. This time, Holt's activities in various parts of Asia are obviously serving the plot of American imperialism to expand its war of aggression in Vietnam and Asia.

	The Australian ruling class actively follows the aggressive policies of American imperialism, hoping to reap some benefits from it. However, we must warn the Holt government that the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia are not to be trifled with. The crimes you have committed in Asia will certainly be settled. If you continue to follow American imperialism, you will surely reap what you sow and become the sacrificial victims of American imperialism.

### 警告澳大利亚反动政府

    警告澳大利亚反动政府
    近来，美帝国主义在亚洲的大小娄罗，互相串通，大肆活动，为美帝国主义拼凑反华包围圈大卖力气。正当这个时候，澳大利亚总理霍尔特也跑到亚洲来，并且接着泰国总理他侬的脚后跟到达台湾，公然同蒋介石匪帮进行勾搭。
    霍尔特反动政府在去年就派遣它的外交部长“访问”了台湾，随后又向蒋介石匪帮派去了“大使”。现在霍尔特又亲自跑到台湾去搞阴谋活动。这是对中国人民的挑衅，也是对亚洲各国人民的挑衅。
    澳大利亚反动政府长期以来一直追随美帝国主义侵略亚洲的政策。霍尔特在去年一月上台以后，更加露骨地投靠美帝国主义。不仅为美国垄断资本渗入澳大利亚大开门户，允许美国在澳大利亚设立军事基地，而且积极支持和参与美帝国主义战略重点东移、包围中国、侵略越南的阴谋，成为美帝国主义的一个得力的走卒。
    霍尔特反动政府更是美帝国主义侵略越南的帮凶。它不顾澳大利亚人民的强烈反对，把侵略南越的澳大利亚帮凶军从一千多人增加到六千多人，并且还派了一个轰炸机中队和一艘导弹驱逐舰，参与屠杀越南人民。这次霍尔特到亚洲各处活动，显然是为美帝国主义在越南和亚洲扩大侵略战争的阴谋效劳。
    澳大利亚统治集团积极追随美帝国主义的侵略政策，妄想从中捞点油水。但是，我们要警告霍尔特政府，中国人民、亚洲人民不是好惹的。你们在亚洲犯下的罪行，是一定要清算的。你们跟着美帝国主义走下去，必将自食其果，成为美帝国主义的殉葬者。
