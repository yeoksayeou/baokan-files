The revolutionary faction of Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policies on cadres, thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line on cadre issues, and resolutely carried out the policy of "uniting the majority and striking down a handful."

According to a report from the *Beijing Daily* on April 13, the proletarian revolutionary faction of Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory, in the fierce struggle between the two lines, has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, braved the storm and waves, and engaged in a resolute struggle against the reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few," which is a component of the bourgeois reactionary line. They have liberated a large number of revolutionary cadres who were struck down and persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line, and have stood together with the broad revolutionary masses on the front line.

The work team's "striking down a large number and protecting a few"

In early June of last year, Chairman Mao personally decided to publish the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism from Beijing University, igniting the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary masses and some revolutionary cadres who awakened earlier in the Second Machine Tool Factory joined forces to launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. They drove away two work teams that implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. On June 23, the proletarian revolutionary faction, with the support of some revolutionary leading cadres of the original factory party committee, rose up to seize the leadership of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire factory.

The rapid and fierce revolutionary storm terrified the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. The next day, a third work team entered the factory. They twisted black and white, declaring that the "June 23" incident (referring to the seizure of power on June 23) was a "counter-revolutionary riot." On one hand, they directed their spears at the revolutionary masses; on the other hand, they put forward the reactionary policy of "striking down a large number and protecting a few," labeling a considerable number of revolutionary cadres who dared to revolt and support the revolutionary masses with hats of "counter-revolutionaries," "backstage bosses," and "traitor to the Party." They suppressed the vigorous revolutionary movement. More cadres were used by them to persecute the masses, strike down the revolutionary faction, implement the bourgeois reactionary line, and act as the "hands" of the work team, causing a serious rift between cadres and the masses.

The proletarian revolutionary faction supports the persecuted cadres to revolt

The brutal suppression did not frighten the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Second Machine Tool Factory. After Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," five revolutionary pioneers in this factory immediately stepped forward, established the first combat team, and clearly raised the slogan of reversing the "June 23" incident, declaring war on the bourgeois reactionary line. At that time, a sharp question was placed before them: dare they still revolt together with the revolutionary cadres who had supported them?

To reverse the "June 23" incident, the revolutionary faction deeply felt the need for the support of revolutionary cadres. At the same time, they used the "Sixteen Points" as a weapon to carefully analyze the class nature of all the cadres in the factory, believing that the majority of cadres were good or relatively good. However, they also estimated that the revolutionary faction was still in an absolutely inferior position in terms of organization. The conservative faction's organization was constantly watching their moves, ready to catch their "weak points." In this situation, if the revolutionary faction contacted those labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" and "traitor to the Party," they would inevitably face a fierce battle.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Second Machine Tool Factory bravely advanced against the wind and waves. They first targeted the persecuted cadres, going to their doors to do ideological work, encouraging cadres to bravely stand up and continue to revolt with them.

As expected, under the deception of the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, some conservatives posted big-character posters attacking the revolutionary faction for "colluding with the power-holders"; they threatened to "struggle against" the cadres who dared to approach and sympathize with the revolutionary faction. Some persecuted cadres, under the pressure of the reactionary line, were poisoned by *Self-Cultivation*, put "self" first, dared not stand up to revolt, dared not contact, and openly express support for the revolutionary faction. Facing this reactionary current, the revolutionary faction was fearless. They openly went to the workshops to do ideological work with the persecuted cadres. They invited the persecuted cadres to participate in the revolutionary faction's criticism meetings of the bourgeois reactionary line, letting the cadres be educated and giving them the opportunity to speak out. They gave lectures to all the cadres in the factory, letting the revolutionary faction fighters, based on their personal experiences, explain Chairman Mao's brilliant work *Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan* to the cadres, helping the cadres to correct their attitudes towards the revolutionary mass movement. Later, the revolutionary faction also issued a proclamation, openly stating their attitude: the revolutionary faction not only supports the cadres who were struck down and persecuted to revolt but also welcomes cadres who have made mistakes to correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The revolutionary faction's open and upright attitude won over and united a part of the revolutionary cadres.

Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policies on cadres

As the overall situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gradually deepened and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line achieved victory after victory, the revolutionary faction of the Second Machine Tool Factory, after arduous struggles, gradually expanded their ranks from a minority to a majority by November of last year. At this time, another new question was placed before them: after uniting the majority of the masses, should they continue to strive to unite the majority of the cadres? At this time, how to deal with the cadres issue caused some differences within the revolutionary ranks. Some comrades did not agree with continuing to work on the cadres, saying, "Those cadres who have not come out by now are either cowards or diehards!" Especially for those cadres who had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, many comrades expressed that they "could not be trusted." Some cadres with relatively serious mistakes came out to "show themselves," and the conservatives attacked them as "traitors." Some in the revolutionary faction also said they were "opportunists." At that time, some key members of the revolutionary faction, to a certain extent, realized that this way of thinking was wrong, but they did not resolutely resist it. Therefore, the work on cadres in this period did not achieve much.

After the revolutionary faction seized power in January, due to the lack of serious establishment of the thought of striving to unite the majority of the cadres, some comrades in the revolutionary faction were not clear on how to deal with the cadres issue and adopted some incorrect practices. This situation alerted the core leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Second Machine Tool Factory. They asked themselves this question: are we striving to unite the revolutionary cadres just to reverse the "June 23" incident? They compared it with Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and realized that revolutionary cadres are the Party's precious wealth. Revolutionary workers should not discriminate against them. Those among them who have made mistakes, as long as they are not power-holders taking the capitalist road, should be educated, won over, and united according to the principle of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient," to fight together with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Several months of revolutionary struggle practice also made them feel the role of revolutionary cadres. They said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is far from over, and the future struggle tasks are still very arduous. Revolutionary cadres are politically more mature and have more experience in their work. The proletarian revolutionary faction also needs more revolutionary cadres to fight together."

It was precisely at this critical moment that Chairman Mao's instruction on the proletarian revolutionary faction's implementation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the struggle for power was transmitted, further pointing the way for the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Second Machine Tool Factory. They quickly corrected some incorrect practices in the early days of seizing power, arranged a batch of cadres who had already come out to suitable positions, and further intensified the work on cadres.

The comrades of the revolutionary faction organized cadres to study the relevant editorials of the *Red Flag* magazine, arranged opportunities for some cadres who were truly willing to come out to "show themselves," mobilized the masses to criticize their mistakes in the spirit of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient," and helped them correct their mistakes. In this way, more cadres were liberated from the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line, returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and stood together with the revolutionary masses, shoulder to shoulder, to jointly bear the heavy responsibilities of revolution and production. A revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership team for the entire factory has also gradually matured.

At present, the broad proletarian revolutionary faction's all-out attack on the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road has deepened the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the Second Machine Tool Factory's understanding of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few." With unparalleled high morale, they have thrown themselves into this new battle, determined to pull down the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, fight him down, fight him to the ground, and fight him to the end. Thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line on cadre issues, eliminate its poison, and through active ideological struggle, gradually unite the majority of the cadres, fight shoulder to shoulder, and thoroughly carry out the revolution.

    北京机床二厂革命派坚决执行毛主席的干部政策
    彻底批判干部问题上资产阶级反动路线  坚决实行“团结大多数，打击一小撮”
    本报讯　据《北京日报》四月十三日报道：北京第二机床厂的无产阶级革命派，在两条路线的激烈斗争中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战狂风，顶恶浪，同“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分，进行了针锋相对的坚决斗争，使一大批受资产阶级反动路线打击、迫害的革命干部解放出来，同广大革命群众一起杀上第一线。
    工作组“打击一大片，保护一小撮”
    去年六月初，毛主席亲自决定发表了北京大学全国第一张马列主义的大字报，点起了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。机床二厂广大革命群众和一部分觉醒较早的革命干部肩并肩向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发动了猛攻。他们一连赶走了两个执行资产阶级反动路线的工作组。六月二十三日，无产阶级革命派又在原厂党委部分革命领导干部的支持下，奋起夺取了全厂无产阶级文化大革命的领导权。
  迅猛异常的革命风暴，吓坏了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。第二天，第三个工作组就又进厂了。他们颠倒黑白地宣称：“六·二三”（即指六月二十三日夺权）是“反革命暴乱”事件。一方面把矛头指向革命群众；另一方面抛出了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，给相当一批敢于革命和支持革命群众的革命干部，扣上“反革命”、“后台老板”、“叛党投降”的帽子，把轰轰烈烈的革命运动打了下去。更多的干部则被他们利用来整群众，打击革命派，执行了资产阶级反动路线，充当了工作队的“打手”，造成了干部和群众关系的严重对立。
    无产阶级革命派支持受迫害的干部起来革命
    残酷的镇压，没有吓倒机床二厂的无产阶级革命派。毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”公布后，这个厂的五名革命闯将立刻挺身而出，建立起第一个战斗小组，旗帜鲜明地提出了为“六·二三”事件翻案的口号，向资产阶级反动路线宣战。当时，一个尖锐的问题摆在他们面前：还敢不敢和支持过他们的革命干部一道闹革命？
    为了给“六·二三”事件翻案，革命派深深感到，需要革命干部的支持。同时他们以“十六条”为武器，对全厂干部作了仔细的阶级分析，认为大多数干部是好的和比较好的。但是，他们也估计到：现在革命派在组织上还处于绝对劣势。保守派组织整天瞪着眼注视他们的动向，准备抓他们的“小辫子”。在这种情况下，革命派如果去接触那些“反革命”、“叛党分子”，必然会有一场恶战。
    机床二厂的无产阶级革命派，硬是迎着风浪前进。他们首先针对那些受迫害的干部，找上门去做思想工作，鼓励干部勇敢地站出来继续和他们一起革命。
    果然，在党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派蒙蔽下，一些保守派贴出大字报，攻击革命派“同当权派勾勾搭搭”；扬言要“揪斗”那些敢于接近和同情革命派的干部。一些受迫害的干部，也慑于反动路线的压力，受到《修养》的毒害，“私”字当头，不敢站出来革命，不敢接触和公开表示支持革命派。革命派在这股反动逆流面前毫不畏惧，他们索性来了个针锋相对，公开地到车间找受迫害的干部做思想工作。他们邀请受迫害的干部参加革命派召开的批判资产阶级反动路线的大会，让干部受教育，给干部站出来发言的机会。他们给全厂干部上课，让革命派战士结合亲身体会，给干部讲解毛主席的光辉著作《湖南农民运动考察报告》，帮助干部端正对待革命群众运动的态度。后来，革命派还发出公告，公开亮明自己的态度：革命派不但支持受打击和迫害的干部起来造反，而且欢迎犯错误的干部改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。革命派这种光明磊落的态度，争取和团结了一部分革命的干部。
    坚决按毛主席的干部政策办事
    随着无产阶级文化大革命整个斗争形势逐步深入，随着毛主席的革命路线的节节胜利，机床二厂的革命派经过艰苦斗争，队伍逐渐壮大，到去年十一月份由少数变成多数。这时，又一个新的问题摆在他们面前：团结了大多数的群众，还要不要继续争取、团结大多数的干部？这时候，如何对待干部的问题，在革命队伍内部产生了一些分歧。有些同志不赞成继续做干部的工作，说：“到今儿还没站出来的干部，不是脓包，就是顽固派！”尤其是对那些执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部，不少同志表示“信不过”。个别错误比较严重的干部出来“亮相”，保守派攻击他们是“叛徒”，革命派中也有人说他们“投机”。那时，革命派的一些骨干，在一定程度上也意识到这种思想是不对的，但是没有坚决进行抵制，因此这一段做干部的工作成绩不大。
    一月份革命派夺权后，由于对争取团结干部大多数的思想没有认真树立起来，革命派内部有些同志在如何对待干部的问题上，认识不够清楚，采取了一些不正确的做法。这种情况，引起了机床二厂革命派领导核心的警惕。他们给自己提出了这样一个问题：我们争取和团结革命的干部，难道就是为了翻“六·二三”事件的案吗？他们对照毛主席的有关教导，认识到，革命的干部是党的宝贵财富，革命的工人绝不应当歧视他们，他们当中有的人有错误，只要不是走资本主义道路的当权派，就应当按照“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，教育、争取和团结他们一起向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开火。几个月的革命斗争实践，也使他们体会到革命干部的作用。他们说：“无产阶级文化大革命还远远没有结束，今后的斗争任务仍然十分繁重，革命的干部政治上比较成熟，业务上比较有经验。无产阶级革命派也很需要有更多的革命干部一起战斗。”
    也正是在这个紧要关头，毛主席关于无产阶级革命派在夺权斗争中必须实行革命的“三结合”的指示传达下来了，进一步为机床二厂的无产阶级革命派指明了方向。他们迅速纠正了夺权初期的一些不正确的作法，把一批已经站出来的干部，安排到合适的岗位上，并进一步大抓干部工作。　
    革命派的同志们连续组织干部学习《红旗》杂志的有关社论，给一些真正愿意站出来的干部安排“亮相”的机会，发动群众本着“惩前毖后、治病救人”的态度，对他们的错误进行批判，帮助他们改正。这样，就使更多的干部，从资产阶级反动路线的束缚下解放了出来，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，心情舒畅地和革命群众站到一起，共同挑起革命和生产两副重担。一个全厂的革命“三结合”的班子，也已逐步酝酿成熟。
    目前，广大无产阶级革命派对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起的总攻击，使机床二厂革命群众和革命干部，更加深了对“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的认识。他们以无比高昂的斗志，投入了这场新的战斗，决心把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派拉下马来，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。彻底批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的流毒，通过积极的思想斗争，逐步团结起大多数干部，并肩战斗，彻底闹革命。
