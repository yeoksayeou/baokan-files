	Guangdong Province experienced widespread heavy rain on March 31 and April 1. This was the first significant rainfall since the beginning of spring. Except for Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island, which saw little to no rain, areas such as Huicheng, Shaoguan, Meixian, Shantou, Zhaoqing, and others received between 80 to 120 millimeters of rain. The Foshan and eastern parts of Zhanjiang, as well as the southern parts of Zhaoqing, received between 20 to 60 millimeters of rain.

	Throughout the winter and early spring, Guangdong Province had very little rainfall. This heavy rain has largely alleviated or eased the drought conditions across the province, which is very beneficial for the current rush to transplant early-season rice seedlings.

	Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, April 3 — Jilin Province experienced widespread snowfall from March 31 to April 3. The central grain-producing areas, which have been relatively dry, received significant snowfall, with some counties receiving over 20 millimeters of precipitation. The western regions received less snow. Today, some areas are still experiencing light snow.

	Currently, it is the spring plowing season. This snowfall will help moisten the soil, which is beneficial for spring farming, especially for the sowing of spring wheat.

    广东降雨　吉林下雪
    新华社广州三日电  广东省在三月三十一日和四月一日全省普降大雨。这是入春以来的第一场好雨。全省除了雷州半岛和海南岛基本无雨外，惠阳、韶关、梅县、汕头、肇庆等专区都下雨八十到一百二十毫米，佛山专区和湛江专区东部、肇庆专区南部，也降雨二十到六十毫米。
    去冬今春，广东省各地雨量很少。这场大雨使省内出现的旱情基本解除或缓和下来，对于目前抢栽早稻秧苗十分有利。
    新华社长春三日电　吉林省各地三月三十一日至四月三日普降喜雪。比较干旱的吉林省中部产粮区，降雪量较大，有些县降水量达二十毫米以上；西部地区降雪较少。今天有些地方还在继续降小雪。
    目前正当春耕时节，这场雪对土地增墒有一定作用，有利于当地春耕，特别是有利于春小麦播种。
