Despite the armed obstruction and bloody suppression by the Indonesian reactionary regime, 30,000 overseas Chinese in Jakarta staged a protest and funeral procession for the martyred compatriots. The Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned the Indonesian Chargé d'Affaires to lodge the strongest protest against the Indonesian government's assault on innocent overseas Chinese.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated April 21, Jakarta: After committing the heinous crime of murdering Ning Xiangyu, the chairman of the Federation of Chinese Associations in Jakarta and the Shandong Association, the right-wing reactionary regime in Indonesia dispatched a large number of armed military police and thugs on April 20 to attack the overseas Chinese who were bidding farewell to Ning Xiangyu, resulting in a serious incident where several dozen overseas Chinese were injured.

After this serious incident, Yao Dengshan, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, immediately went to the residence of Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik to demand a meeting, lodging the most urgent and strongest protest against this atrocity. However, Malik, feeling guilty and ashamed, dared not meet with Yao Dengshan.

Ning Xiangyu was illegally detained and tortured to death in prison on April 13 after being summoned and detained by the Indonesian police on April 8 on trumped-up charges. On April 18, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, lodging the strongest protest against this serious incident and putting forward various reasonable demands. On the morning of April 19, Xu Ren, the Chinese Consul General in Jakarta, reiterated the demands made in the note during a meeting with Subarjo, the Director of the Asian and Pacific Affairs Department of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, that the Indonesian side must ensure the safety of the overseas Chinese's mourning and funeral activities for Ning Xiangyu. However, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary regime escalated the situation and deliberately created this new bloody incident.

The Indonesian reactionaries' heinous crime of murdering Ning Xiangyu has sparked great indignation among the patriotic overseas Chinese in Jakarta. On April 19, nearly 10,000 overseas Chinese in Jakarta, filled with grief and anger, went to pay their respects. On April 20, when bidding farewell to Ning Xiangyu, initially, there were about 4,000 to 5,000 people participating in the funeral procession. Along the way, many more overseas Chinese joined, quickly forming a procession of about 30,000 people. This just action of the patriotic overseas Chinese received strong support and sympathy from the Indonesian people. As the funeral procession passed, about 100,000 people lined the streets, causing many roads to be congested. When this orderly procession approached the Banjir Kanal Street where the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia is located, a group of thugs armed with weapons rushed into the funeral procession and attacked people. The paratrooper combat teams and other army units pre-positioned near the Chinese Embassy opened fire on the mourning crowd twice. The attacks by the armed military police and thugs resulted in several dozen overseas Chinese being injured.

However, the overseas Chinese participating in the funeral, armed with the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong, read aloud the quotations of Chairman Mao amidst the gunfire, shouted slogans, and continued to advance bravely. The entire funeral procession, undeterred by the attacks of the right-wing armed military police and thugs and the subsequent heavy rain, marched for four and a half hours to reach the cemetery. An injured overseas Chinese student, covered in blood, was still shouting the slogan "Advance bravely" with the help of his companions and insisted on reaching the cemetery. Many elderly participants also persisted in walking the entire way.

The patriotic overseas Chinese in Jakarta, fearless of the bloody suppression by the Indonesian right-wing armed military police, persisted in their struggle, demonstrating the great heroic spirit of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, which no violent action can suppress. They greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and thoroughly exposed the arrogance of the Indonesian reactionaries, setting an example in the overseas Chinese community of daring to struggle and daring to win. The Indonesian reactionary regime, in order to deal with these unarmed overseas Chinese, actually deployed fully armed military police, which only further exposed the brutal and weak reactionary nature of the Indonesian reactionary regime.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated April 21, a responsible official of the Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned the Indonesian Chargé d'Affaires, Baren, on April 21 to express strong indignation and lodge the strongest protest against the serious incident where Indonesian paratrooper combat teams opened fire on unarmed overseas Chinese who were bidding farewell to Ning Xiangyu, the chairman of the Shandong Association who was tortured to death, resulting in several dozen overseas Chinese being injured.

The responsible official of the Foreign Ministry sternly pointed out that the Indonesian government, disregarding the protest and various reasonable demands put forward in the note sent by the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia on April 18, and disregarding the solemn warning made by the responsible official of the Chinese Foreign Ministry to the Indonesian Chargé d'Affaires on April 19 that the Indonesian government must ensure the safety of the funeral activities for Ning Xiangyu, brazenly deployed fully armed troops to open fire on the unarmed and grief-stricken overseas Chinese, and organized "KAMI" and "KABI" thugs to commit violence. This heinous crime is entirely premeditated by the Indonesian government, deliberately provoking the Chinese people, and further damaging the relations between the two countries. The Indonesian government bears direct and inescapable responsibility for this serious incident.

The responsible official of the Foreign Ministry strongly demanded that the Indonesian government publicly apologize; severely punish the perpetrators and their instigators; take effective measures to rescue the injured overseas Chinese, bear all expenses, and compensate for all losses; ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future; and that the Chinese side reserves the right to make further demands.

    不顾印尼反动当局的武力阻拦和血腥镇压
    雅加达三万华侨示威为死难侨胞送葬
    我外交部召见印尼临时代办最强烈抗议印尼政府打伤无辜华侨
    据新华社二十一日讯  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派反动当局在犯下残杀雅加达中华侨团总会理事、山东公会主席宁祥雨老人的滔天罪行之后，二十日又出动大批武装军警和暴徒，袭击为宁祥雨送葬的华侨，制造了打伤华侨十几人的严重流血事件。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆临时代办姚登山，在这一严重流血事件发生后，立即到印尼外交部长马利克的住所要求会见马利克，就这一暴行提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。但是，马利克心虚理亏，不敢会见姚登山代办。
    宁祥雨老人是在八日被印度尼西亚警察部以莫须有的罪名，非法传讯扣押的。他在监狱中遭到严刑拷打，在十三日死亡。中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆十八日照会印尼外交部，就这一严重事件提出了最强烈的抗议，并且提出了各项合理要求。中国驻雅加达总领事徐仁在十九日上午会见印尼外交部亚洲太平洋司司长苏巴佐时，重申了照会中提出的印尼方面应切实保障华侨为宁祥雨吊丧送葬活动的安全的要求。但是，印尼右派反动当局却变本加厉，蓄意制造了这场新的流血事件。
    印尼反动派残杀宁祥雨老人的滔天罪行，激起了雅加达广大爱国华侨的极大愤怒。十九日，雅加达华侨近万人满腔悲愤地前往吊唁。二十日为宁祥雨老人送葬时，一开始就有四、五千人参加了送葬队伍，沿途又有许多华侨参加，很快汇集成一支约三万人的浩浩荡荡的队伍。爱国华侨的这一正义行动，得到了印尼人民的有力的支持和同情。在送葬队伍经过时，沿途约有十万人围观，把许多街道挤得水泄不通。当这支秩序井然的队伍走近中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆所在的班芝兰大街时，一批暴徒手持凶器冲入送葬队伍打人，预先布置在中国大使馆附近的伞兵战斗团等陆军部队，两次向送葬的群众疯狂开枪。武装军警和暴徒的袭击，使送葬华侨有十几人受伤。
    但是，参加送葬的华侨以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，在枪声中齐声朗读毛主席语录，高呼口号，继续奋勇前进。整个送葬行列不顾右派武装军警和暴徒们的袭击，不顾以后遇到的几次倾盆大雨，坚持行进四个半小时，到达了墓地。有一个被打伤的华侨学生全身流血，但他仍然在同伴的扶持下，高呼“奋勇前进”的口号，坚持到达墓地。许多参加送葬的老人，也一直坚持步行。
    雅加达广大爱国华侨不畏印尼右派武装军警的血腥镇压，坚持斗争，表现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民的大无畏的英雄气概，这是任何暴力行动也压服不了的。他们大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了印尼反动派的威风，在华侨中树立了一个敢于斗争、敢于胜利的榜样。印尼反动当局为了对付这些手无寸铁的华侨，竟然出动全副武装的军警，这只不过更加暴露了印尼反动派这个纸老虎的残暴虚弱的反动本质。
    新华社二十一日讯  中国外交部负责人员二十一日召见印度尼西亚驻华大使馆临时代办巴伦，就二十日下午雅加达印尼伞兵战斗团开枪射击为受刑致死的山东公会主席宁祥雨送葬的无辜华侨，以致十几名华侨受伤的严重事件，表示十分愤慨，并提出最强烈的抗议。
    外交部负责人员严词指出，印尼政府不顾中国驻印尼大使馆四月十八日的照会所提出的抗议和各项合理要求，不顾中国外交部负责人员四月十九日向印尼驻华临时代办所提出的印尼政府必须保障对宁祥雨的殡葬活动的安全的严正警告，公然出动全副武装的部队，对手无寸铁、满怀悲愤的送葬华侨开枪射击，并组织“卡米”和“卡比”暴徒持械行凶，这种丧心病狂的罪行，完全是出于印尼政府的预谋，蓄意向中国人民挑衅，进一步破坏两国关系。印尼政府对这一严重事件负有不可推委的直接的责任。
    外交部负责人员强烈要求印尼政府对此公开道歉；严惩凶手及其主使人；采取有效措施抢救受伤华侨，负担一切费用，赔偿一切损失；保证今后不再发生类似事件；中国方面保留进一步提出要求的权利。
