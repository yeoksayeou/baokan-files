Shanghai's broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries enthusiastically acclaim the publication of the "People's Daily" editorial "Why We Must Focus on Criticizing the 'Strike at the Masses, Protect a Few' Component of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line." They say, this editorial greatly boosts the morale of the proletarian revolutionaries and strikes a heavy blow to the bourgeois reactionary line. We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of "strike at the masses, protect a few" proposed by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and unite with the majority of revolutionary cadres, fiercely striking at the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists.

After the publication of the "People's Daily" editorial, representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Committee Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station, the "New Normal University" Red Guards of East China Normal University, the Shanghai Instrument and Telecommunications Industry Bureau, and the Shanghai Special Steel Tube Factory, among other units, shared their recent experiences and insights in criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line of "strike at the masses, protect a few" in cadre issues, based on their study notes.

Thoroughly criticize "strike at the masses, protect a few" to better achieve revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination"

The representatives participating in the discussion used a large amount of facts to illustrate that in departments and units where the bourgeois reactionary line of "strike at the masses, protect a few" was criticized early, deeply, and thoroughly, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line was even more deeply ingrained in people's minds, and Chairman Mao's cadre policy was better implemented. Through criticism, the various revolutionary mass organizations in these departments and units quickly eliminated differences in cadre issues; some of the masses who were previously deceived saw the truth in the criticism, strengthened their unity with the revolutionary factions; revolutionary cadres who were struck down by the bourgeois reactionary line were liberated, stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, and launched a counterattack against the bourgeois reactionary line and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, powerfully promoting the achievement of revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," creating extremely important conditions for implementing the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

The leader of the Shanghai Instrument and Telecommunications Industry Bureau Revolutionary Rebel Brigade said, in the great storm of the "January Revolution," we used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to relatively early see through the reactionary nature of "strike at the masses, protect a few." We followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "be good at identifying cadres," not only looking at the leaders' "momentary actions" but also their "entire history and work," differentiating situations and treating them differently. When we bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production and repelled the counter-revolutionary economic wind, we paid attention to uniting a group of good and relatively good revolutionary leading cadres to fight together, creating a good premise for later achieving revolutionary great unity and establishing a temporary power organ of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

The representatives emphasized that because the root of "strike at the masses, protect a few" is deep, the poison is widespread, and the harm is great, thoroughly exposing its reactionary nature and thoroughly eliminating its pernicious influence is a very important and arduous task that must not be taken lightly. Especially at the current critical moment of the struggle for power, the proletarian revolutionaries must aim at the target and make criticizing "strike at the masses, protect a few" an urgent task, resolutely criticizing it deeply, thoroughly, and overturning it.

Resolutely expose the "turning the tables" tricks of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and boldly criticize "strike at the masses, protect a few"

The representatives participating in the discussion angrily pointed out, "the enemy will not perish of its own accord," "they will make their last struggle." Now, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, taking advantage of our focus on criticizing the "strike at the masses, protect a few" component of the bourgeois reactionary line, are distorting right and wrong, confusing black and white, framing the proletarian revolutionaries with the crime of "strike at the masses, protect a few," "turning the tables" on the revolutionaries and biting back, which is utterly stupid and extremely shameless! Who is the culprit behind "strike at the masses, protect a few"? Who is the most resolute in opposing and resisting "strike at the masses, protect a few"? This is a major issue that must be debated clearly. Everyone used ironclad facts to prove that those who framed the revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries" were the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; those who struck down a "large number" of revolutionary cadres and protected a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists were still the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses hate the bourgeois reactionary line the most, support Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line the most, oppose "strike at the masses, protect a few" the most, and resolutely implement "unite with the majority, strike at a few."

The representative of the Shanghai Municipal Committee Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station said, Chairman Mao taught us: "We must look at things from their essence, and regard their phenomena only as a guide to entry. Once we enter the door, we must grasp their essence, this is a reliable and scientific method of analysis." Using Chairman Mao's class viewpoint and class analysis method to analyze the phenomenon of a "large number" of cadres in the old Shanghai Municipal Committee being struck down, best explains the problem. The number one power-holder within the Party in the Shanghai region who is taking the capitalist road used various means to achieve the evil goal of "strike at the masses, protect a few": they set the tone for themselves, drew frames, saying things like "the Municipal Committee is correct, revolutionary," shifting the target of the masses' struggle to various levels of cadres. Even more sinister, this handful of people even blocked the voices of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, causing a large number of cadres to be unaware of the truth, walking further and further down the wrong path, while they themselves tried to escape responsibility, etc. Revolutionary masses, even if they have some excessive actions in the great revolutionary storm, are out of their extreme hatred for this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists; the root of some excessive actions lies with this handful of people. We warn this handful of people, you will not be able to get half a stalk of rice from the revolutionaries!

Everyone excitedly talked about how the "People's Daily" editorial fully and correctly discussed the reactionary essence of "strike at the masses, protect a few," pointing out the main target of our criticism, and supporting the proletarian revolutionaries' backbone. We criticize "strike at the masses, protect a few," our reasoning is more correct, and our spirit is more vigorous. No matter what new tricks or new plots the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road will play, they are all in vain and will not be able to shake our determination to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line.

Dare to "strike at a few" and "liberate the masses," unite with the majority, and be a model in implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy

The revolutionary young warriors of the "New Normal University" Red Guards of East China Normal University deeply felt that from the perspective of our school's struggle practice, revolutionary leading cadres are indeed an indispensable important force. They have rich struggle experience and are politically more mature than us. Now, while we focus on criticizing "strike at the masses, protect a few," we must follow Chairman Mao's instruction of "punish the past to prevent the future, cure the sickness to save the person," help cadres to "appear" in the masses' struggle and accept the masses' examination. As long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who insist on not changing and are incorrigible, we must allow them to change and encourage them to redeem themselves.

Criticizing "strike at the masses, protect a few" is an important part of the current major battle to criticize the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. This criticism process is also a process for the proletarian revolutionaries to thoroughly eliminate the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line on their own ranks, and more importantly, it is a process of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, breaking private interests and establishing public interests. If we do not thoroughly eliminate the influence of "strike at the masses, protect a few" in the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries, it will not only seriously hinder the current struggle for power but also seriously hinder the thorough implementation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and seriously hinder the cause of the proletarian revolution in our country. We are the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. If we do not settle accounts with this bourgeois reactionary line, we will not be able to correctly distinguish and handle the two types of different contradictions, and we will not be able to correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

The comrades participating in the discussion unanimously expressed that we must further carry forward the spirit of daring to venture, dare to do, dare to make revolution, and dare to rebel. We must dare to strike at the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and also dare to "liberate the masses," uniting with the majority of cadres. To defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we are not afraid of anything, not afraid of being called "rightist," not afraid of being labeled "royalist," and not afraid of being "erased" for uniting with the majority of cadres. We must resolutely remove the "self" from our minds, take immediate action, and be models in implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

    勇于“打击一小撮”　敢于“解放一大片”
    ——上海无产阶级革命派座谈交流批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的体会和经验
    上海广大无产阶级革命派热烈欢呼《人民日报》社论《为什么要着重批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分》的发表。他们说，这篇社论大长无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭资产阶级反动路线的威风。我们一定要坚决遵照毛主席的教导，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派提出的在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，紧紧团结大多数革命干部，狠狠打击一小撮反革命修正主义分子。
    《人民日报》社论发表以后，上海市委机关革命造反联络站、华东师范大学红卫兵“新师大”师和上海市仪表电讯工业局、上海异型钢管厂等单位的革命派代表，结合他们的学习心得，座谈和交流了最近一个时期批判在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的体会和经验。
    彻底批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，更好地实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”
    参加座谈的代表们用大量的事实说明，凡是对“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分批判得早，批判得深，批判得透的部门和单位，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就愈加深入人心，毛主席的干部政策就执行得更好。通过批判，这些部门和单位的各个革命群众组织，在干部问题上的分歧迅速消除；一部分原来受蒙蔽的群众，在批判中看清了事实真相，加强了同革命派的团结；遭受资产阶级反动路线打击的革命干部得到解放，站在无产阶级革命派一边，向资产阶级反动路线和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大杀回马枪，有力地推动了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”的实现，为贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针创造了极为重要的条件。
    上海工业系统中最早建立局级革命委员会的上海市仪表电讯工业局革命造反大队负责人说，我们在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，以毛泽东思想为武器，比较早地识破了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动本质。我们根据毛主席“必须善于识别干部”的教导，不但看领导干部的“一时一事”，而且看他们的“全部历史和全部工作”，分别情况，区别对待。在勇挑革命和生产两副重担，击退反革命经济主义妖风的时候，我们就注意团结一批好的和比较好的革命领导干部一起战斗，为后来实现革命的大联合，建立革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，创造了良好的前提。
    代表们强调指出，由于“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的根子很粗，流毒很广，危害很大，要彻底揭露它的反动性，彻底肃清它的恶劣影响，是一项十分重大而又艰巨的战斗任务，千万不可等闲视之。特别在当前夺权斗争处在关键性时刻，无产阶级革命派应当对准目标，把批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，作为当务之急，坚决把它批深批透批倒。
    坚决揭穿党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派“倒打一耙”的阴谋诡计，理直气壮地批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”
    参加座谈会的代表愤怒指出，“敌人是不会自行消灭的”，“他们还要作最后的挣扎”。现在党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，乘我们着重批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分的时机，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，把“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的罪名，强加在无产阶级革命派头上，对革命派“倒打一耙”，反咬一口，真是愚蠢透顶，无耻之极！到底谁是提出“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的罪魁祸首？到底谁最坚决反对和抵制“打击一大片，保护一小撮”？这是大是大非问题，一定要辩论清楚。大家用铁一般的事实证明，把革命群众打成“反革命”的，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派；把“一大片”革命干部打下去，保护一小撮反革命修正主义分子的，还是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众最痛恨资产阶级反动路线，最拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，最反对“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，最坚决地实行“团结大多数，打击一小撮”。
    上海市委机关革命造反联络站代表说，毛主席教导我们：“我们看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导，一进了门就要抓住它的实质，这才是可靠的科学的分析方法。”用毛主席的阶级观点、阶级分析的方法，来分析旧上海市委内“一大片”干部遭受打击的现象，最能说明问题。上海地区党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，玩弄种种手法，达到“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的罪恶目的：他们给自己定调子，划框框，说什么“市委是正确的，革命的”，把群众斗争的目标转移到各级干部身上。更加毒辣的是，这一小撮人甚至封锁毛主席和党中央的声音，使大批干部不明真相，在错误的道路上越走越远，而他们自己却妄图逃脱罪责，等等。革命群众在大革命的风浪中，即使有些过火的行动，也是出于对这一小撮反革命修正主义分子的无比仇恨；有些过火行动的根子，就在这一小撮人的身上。我们要警告这一小撮人，你们休想从革命派身上捞到半根稻草！
    大家兴奋地谈到，《人民日报》这篇社论，全面地正确地论述了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动实质，指出了我们批判的主要锋芒所向，撑了我们无产阶级革命派的腰。我们批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，理更直，气更壮了。不管党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派还会耍什么新花招，搞什么新阴谋，统统都是枉费心机，休想动摇我们彻底批判资产阶级反动路线的决心。
    勇于“打击一小撮”，敢于“解放一大片”，团结大多数，做贯彻执行毛主席干部政策的模范
    华东师范大学红卫兵“新师大”师的革命小将深有体会地说，从我们学校的斗争实践来看，革命领导干部确实是一支不可缺少的重要力量。他们有丰富的斗争经验，政治上比我们成熟。现在，我们在着重批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的同时，对犯错误的干部，一定要遵照毛主席的教导“惩前毖后、治病救人”，帮助干部到群众斗争中去“亮相”，接受群众的审查。只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。
    批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，是当前批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派这个大战役的重要组成部分。这个批判过程，也是无产阶级革命派彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线对自己队伍的影响的过程，更是活学活用毛主席著作、破私立公的过程。如果不彻底肃清“打击一大片，保护一小撮”在无产阶级革命派队伍中的影响，不但会严重妨碍当前的夺权斗争，而且会严重妨碍把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，严重妨碍我国的无产阶级革命事业。我们是无产阶级革命事业的接班人，不清算这条资产阶级反动路线，就不能正确地区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，不能正确地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策。
    参加座谈会的同志一致表示，我们要进一步发扬敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的精神，既勇于打击一小撮反革命修正主义分子，也敢于“解放一大片”，团结大多数干部。为了保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们什么也不怕，不怕别人说自己“右倾”，不怕戴上
  “保皇”的帽子，不怕因为团结了大多数干部，被别人“抹煞”成绩。我们要坚决打掉头脑里的“私”字，立即行动起来，做贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策的模范。
