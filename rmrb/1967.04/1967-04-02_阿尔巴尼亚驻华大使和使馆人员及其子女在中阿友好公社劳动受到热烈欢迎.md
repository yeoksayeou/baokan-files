Albanian Ambassador to China Comrade Natanaeli and other embassy staff, along with their children totaling more than thirty people, went to the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing on the morning of the 31st to work. They were warmly welcomed by the commune members.

During the work, the Albanian children formed a propaganda team and went to places where there were many workers to read Chairman Mao's quotations and sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. The commune members were greatly inspired. During the rest period, some members of the commune's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and commune members sang revolutionary songs from both China and Albania for the Albanian comrades. The Albanian comrades also sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" with the commune members. The fields were filled with the atmosphere of revolutionary comrades from China and Albania working side by side and fighting together in close unity.
