The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has recently, through its propaganda machine and overseas personnel, openly expressed support for the right-wing military regime of Suharto-Nasution in Indonesia. This has once again exposed its traitorous face to the people of the world.

According to a report by Agence France-Presse on April 4, citing the Antara News Agency from Jakarta, a Soviet consul general, Yefov, on April 1 expressed to the military commander in Medan that "the Soviet Union will strive to promote its relations with Indonesia." It is reported that this Soviet official also stated that the attitude of the Soviet government towards the right-wing military regime in Indonesia has not changed due to the fact that the head of the right-wing military regime, Suharto, has become the "acting president."

Previously, on March 30, the foreign minister of the Indonesian right-wing military regime, Malik, spoke to Western journalists and expressed satisfaction with the praise given to the Indonesian right-wing military regime by the mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, Moscow Radio.

Beijing, April 8: The mouthpiece of the modern Soviet revisionist leadership clique, *Pravda*, has recently been lavishly praising the lackeys of imperialism—the "Malaysia" puppet clique.

This newspaper is very pleased with its new partner, who has a notorious reputation, and has consecutively published communications by its special correspondent praising the reactionaries of "Malaysia." In a communication published on April 7, it said regarding the agreement between the Soviet revisionists and the "Malaysia" puppet clique to establish diplomatic relations: "This situation is a major shift in Malaysia's foreign policy. This shows that the Malaysian government has realistically evaluated the situation on the international stage."

*Pravda*'s words reflect the principle of "birds of a feather flock together." It is precisely because the "Malaysia" puppet clique sees the situation of collusion between the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists on the international stage, which aligns with its own reactionary interests, that it has "realistically" agreed to establish relations with the Soviet revisionists to play the role of a clown in the anti-revolutionary, anti-China "holy alliance" of the United States and the Soviet Union.

The communication published by *Pravda* on April 7 reveals that the Soviet revisionists' collusion with such an imperialist puppet has the dirty purpose of uniting against China. It reveals through the mouth of a so-called "Malaysia" writer that local anti-China forces "listen" to the broadcasts of Moscow Radio, which distort and slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, "listening to its analysis of the nature of Chinese events." The communication indicates that these anti-China elements are using the black goods spread by Moscow Radio to slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

### 苏修拚命拉拢美帝走狗  公开支持印尼右派政权  大肆吹捧“马来西亚”傀儡

    苏修拚命拉拢美帝走狗
    公开支持印尼右派政权
    大肆吹捧“马来西亚”傀儡
    新华社讯　雅加达消息：苏联修正主义领导集团最近一再通过它的宣传机器和驻外人员，公开表示支持印尼苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人政权。这就再次在全世界人民面前暴露了它的叛徒嘴脸。
    据法新社四日从雅加达援引安塔拉通讯社报道，苏联的一名总领事叶若夫一日向棉兰驻军头目表示，“苏联将设法促进它同印尼的关系”。据报道，这个苏联官员还表示，苏联政府对印尼右派军人政权的态度，并没有由于印尼右派军人政权的头目苏哈托担任“代理总统”而改变。
    在此以前，印尼右派军人政权的外交部长马利克三月三十日向西方记者发表谈话时，对苏联修正主义领导集团的喉舌——莫斯科电台吹捧印尼右派军人政权表示满意。
    新华社八日讯　莫斯科消息：苏联现代修正主义领导集团的喉舌《真理报》最近大肆吹捧帝国主义的走狗——“马来西亚”傀儡集团。
    这家报纸对苏修勾搭上这样一个臭名远扬的新伙伴感到十分得意，接连发表它的特派记者所写的赞赏“马来西亚”反动派的通讯。它在七日刊载的一篇通讯，谈到苏修和“马来西亚”傀儡集团同意建交这个勾当时说：“这一情况是马来西亚对外政策的重大转变。这说明马来西亚政府现实主义地评价了国际舞台上形成的局势。”
    《真理报》的这番话反映了“物以类聚，人以群分”的道理。正是“马来西亚”傀儡集团看到在国际舞台上出现了苏修和美帝勾结的局势，合乎它自己的反动利益，因此，它就“现实主义地”同意同苏修建交，以便在美苏的反革命、反华“神圣同盟”中充当一个小丑的角色。
    《真理报》七日发表的通讯暴露出，苏修同这样一个帝国主义的傀儡勾搭，有着联合反华的肮脏目的。它借一个所谓“马来西亚”作家之口，透露当地的反华势力“倾听”莫斯科电台广播的歪曲和诽谤中国文化大革命的谣言，“倾听它对中国事件性质的分析”。通讯表明，这些反华分子是利用莫斯科电台散布的黑货，诽谤中国文化大革命的。
