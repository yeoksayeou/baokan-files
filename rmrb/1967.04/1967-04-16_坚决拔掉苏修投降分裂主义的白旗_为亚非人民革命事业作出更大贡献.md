The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Calls for a Thorough Settlement of the Soviet Revisionists' Crime of Betraying the Afro-Asian Revolutionary Cause by Holding a Bogus "Third Congress"

Resolutely Pull Down the White Flag of Soviet Revisionist Capitulationism and Splitism
Make Greater Contributions to the Revolutionary Cause of the Afro-Asian Peoples

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China Creates Favorable Conditions for Successfully Holding the Afro-Asian Writers' Congress in Beijing This Year

New China News Agency, April 15th

The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau issued a statement titled "Pressing the Advantage" on April 13th regarding the illegal and splitist bogus "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Congress" held in Beirut. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The illegal and splitist bogus "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Congress," orchestrated by the Soviet revisionist leadership, concluded in a rush amidst heavy contradictions, difficulties, and chaos on March 29, 1967.

This bogus congress was a case of playing with fire and getting burned for the Soviet revisionists. It was a major exposure of their reactionary, counter-revolutionary line of capitulationism.

The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau expresses deep respect and unbounded admiration to all progressive and revolutionary writers, national liberation organizations, other progressive organizations, and progressive international organizations in Asia and Africa. They responded to our call and dealt a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist splitists; they not only refused to attend the Beirut conference but also issued solemn statements, news releases, and press talks, denouncing and strongly condemning this conspiracy against the progressive and revolutionary writers and peoples of Asia and Africa.

The Ceylon Writers' Association, the Ceylon Young Writers' Association, the Ceylon Afro-Asian Solidarity Association, the Chinese Writers' Association, the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, the Japan Afro-Asian Writers' Conference Preparatory Committee, the Pakistan Writers' Association, the Pakistan Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organization, the Senegal Afro-Asian Writers' Liaison Committee, the Somali Writers' Association, the Somali Journalists' Association, the Sudan Free Pen Club, the Syrian Afro-Asian Writers' Liaison Committee, the Tanzanian Writers' Association; progressive and revolutionary writers from Indonesia, Japan, Malaya, Thailand, and Turkey; the Nationalist Organization of Angola, the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania, the Bechuanaland People's Party, the Basutoland Congress Party, the General Secretariat of the Movement for Self-Determination and Independence of the Canary Islands, the Revolutionary Committee of Mozambique, the Mozambique African National Union, the Swaziland Progressive Party, the South West Africa People's Organization; the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Liaison Committee, and other organizations issued public statements and press talks, denouncing and condemning the illegal and splitist bogus congress held in Beirut.

Revolutionary writers, journalists, and freedom fighters from Angola, Azania, Basutoland, Botswana, Cameroon, Ceylon, China, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Malaya, Mozambique, Niger, North Kalimantan, South West Africa, Sudan, Thailand, Yemen, and Zimbabwe issued a joint statement condemning the bogus congress in Beirut.

In addition, writers' organizations from Cambodia, Congo (Brazzaville), Guinea, Mali, Pakistan, and many other countries completely boycotted the illegal and splitist bogus congress held in Beirut.

Apart from the above, the heroic writers of Albania, who are on the front line of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle in Europe, also gave us fighting support.

Before the bogus "Third Congress," the revisionists repeatedly boasted that representatives from seventy Afro-Asian countries and three hundred people would attend the conference. In reality, only representatives from over thirty Afro-Asian countries and over a hundred people attended, with the Soviet revisionist delegation and delegations from three other countries making up more than half of the total.

From the meager number of countries and people attending the bogus congress, and the numerous statements issued by writers' organizations, writers, and nationalist parties from so many Afro-Asian countries denouncing the bogus "Third Congress," it is clear that the Soviet revisionists' reactionary line of capitulationism is futile, a complete failure, and utterly isolated.

Even among those who attended the congress, apart from a small clique of Soviet revisionist puppets, some were coerced by pressure, some were deceived into attending, and some were lackeys of American imperialism. It is noteworthy that the Secretary-General of UNESCO was also invited to this bogus congress, and the Soviet revisionists had begged that Secretary-General for financial aid to realize their conspiracy.

Analyzing the goals exposed in the speeches made by the Soviet revisionists at the bogus preparatory meeting in Cairo before the bogus "Third Congress," the general report concocted at the bogus "Third Congress," the speech by the head of the Soviet revisionist delegation at the bogus congress, the "general declaration" issued before the bogus congress ended, and the reactions of the attendees to all of the above, it is clear that the bogus "Third Congress" was a white flag raised by the Soviet revisionists to realize U.S.-Soviet cultural cooperation and consolidate the "sacred U.S.-Soviet alliance." It was another serious crime committed by the Soviet revisionists in their attempt to betray the revolutionary cause of the Afro-Asian peoples.

Here, it is necessary to recall that at the bogus preparatory meeting in Cairo, not a single document was issued, nor was a single word spoken to condemn imperialism led by the United States or to support the anti-imperialist struggle of the Afro-Asian peoples.

As a continuation of this betrayal by the revisionists, in the general report of the bogus "Third Congress," or in the speech by the Soviet revisionist delegation, or in the "general declaration" issued before the bogus congress ended, not a single word was used to condemn the crimes of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam, or to support the just position of the famous Four-Point Proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Five-Point Declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, or to support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's famous call. Instead, the Soviet revisionists followed the path of blatant betrayal of the sacred cause of the Vietnamese people, supporting the "peace talks" plotted by the U.S. imperialists to force the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and surrender to U.S. imperialism. The "general declaration" of the bogus "Third Congress" "demands an immediate halt to the savage bombing and the gradual escalation of U.S. aggression in Vietnam," which blatantly exposes the Soviet revisionists' conspiracy to serve U.S. imperialism and peddle "peace talks." At present, when U.S. imperialism is, according to the guidelines of the Guam conference, frantically expanding the war of aggression in Vietnam, the Soviet revisionists do not demand the complete withdrawal of all U.S. troops and their puppet troops from South Vietnam, the dismantling of all U.S. military bases in South Vietnam; they do not demand that the U.S. get out of Vietnam and let the South Vietnamese people solve their own problems according to the plan of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, but instead allow the U.S. aggressors to continue occupying Vietnamese territory and lingering in South Vietnam. They only demand "peace talks" and an immediate halt to bombing and war "escalation." Isn't this the same as the so-called "new proposal" recently peddled by Thant for U.S. imperialism? This is actually providing cover for the U.S. conspiracy to expand the war of aggression and force the Vietnamese people to kneel and surrender to the U.S. aggressors under the pressure of U.S. bombs and cannons. This fully exposes the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership in betraying the U.S. imperialists and selling out the sacred anti-U.S. struggle for national liberation of the Vietnamese people.

In supporting the Palestinian Arab people's struggle against the U.S. imperialist tool Israel, the Soviet revisionists, just as in the Vietnamese issue, blatantly exposed their ugly face of betraying the revolutionary cause of the Arab people, and thus encountered opposition from the Arab delegates. The Soviet revisionist delegation deliberately avoided discussing the essence of the Palestinian people's struggle, not only failing to condemn the U.S. imperialists' crimes of aggression but also colluding with the Indian delegation at the bogus congress to deliberately sabotage the genuine wishes of the Palestinian people. They explained that they took this stance because they had "not studied" the Palestinian issue, and that they were only interested in literature and poetry, not politics.

We will not discuss what kind of "literature" and "poetry" the Soviet revisionists are interested in. We ask, are you really not interested in politics? Of course, you are not interested in revolutionary politics, and you are stubbornly opposed to it. You are interested in reactionary politics, and you are not only interested but also obsessed with it. You are not interested in supporting the revolutionary struggle of the Palestinian people, but you are very interested in colluding with Israel! You have already acknowledged that Israel, the tool of imperialist aggression against Arab countries, is a state, and you have established diplomatic relations with it. You are sending batch after batch of people from the Soviet Union to settle in Israel. Other countries, including China, allow the Palestinian Liberation Organization to set up offices, but why do you refuse to allow it to set up an office in Moscow? The Arab people and other peoples of Asia and Africa demand the elimination of Israel, but why are you so interested, especially in Arab countries, in vigorously promoting the so-called "Tashkent spirit," advocating that the Palestinian people "reconcile" and "live in peace" with the U.S. imperialist tool Israel? You are actually very interested in this kind of politics. You completely ignore the demand raised at the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers held in Beijing last year, attended by fifty-three countries and regions of Asia and Africa and five Afro-Asian international organizations, to sever all political relations with Israel and economically and culturally boycott Israel. Instead, you continue to maintain diplomatic and other relations with Israel, thus completely betraying the sacred cause of the Arab people. What kind of political interests you have is not clear? Your conspiracy of "only talking about literature and not politics" has been completely exposed.

The revolutionary writers of Asia and Africa are not only concerned about revolutionary politics but also very concerned about revolutionary literature and art. They believe that politics and literature are inseparable. They follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong: "To make literature and art a good component of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, to help the people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind." Therefore, at the emergency meeting in Beijing, 160 writers from fifty-three countries and regions of Asia and Africa, in addition to passing thirty-four resolutions to firmly support the struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, repeatedly exchanged views on the issue of revolutionary literature and art and unanimously passed a resolution "on literature serving the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle." They called on all revolutionary Afro-Asian writers to "create and develop new culture and literature that is anti-imperialist, revolutionary, and national, and that serves the people, using national forms that the masses love to sing the revolutionary struggle of the Afro-Asian peoples for national independence and the maintenance of national independence," but the Soviet revisionist writers are not interested in this revolutionary literature and art. They are most interested in going to the grave of the head of U.S. imperialism, Kennedy, to lay a wreath, and in writing poetry like "The City of Yes and the City of No" that shamelessly praises Western capitalism. This is a typical act of treason and counter-revolutionary politics! We must point out that the Soviet revisionists sending this infamous traitor "poet" Yevtushenko from Kennedy's grave to Beirut to participate in the bogus "Third Congress" is not accidental. This typical representative of revisionism is the white flag raised by the Soviet revisionists at the bogus "Third Congress." In a telegram to the bogus congress, he said, "The West is no longer the West of the past, and the East is no longer the East of the past. When the two come closer, they have already merged." This is the Soviet revisionists' confession of U.S.-Soviet cultural cooperation and their counter-revolutionary "sacred U.S.-Soviet alliance." This is their confession of capitulating to U.S. imperialism and proving their theory of "peaceful coexistence" with U.S. imperialism. This exposes the true purpose of the Soviet revisionists in holding the bogus "Third Congress." This is the true "general declaration" of the bogus "Third Congress."

In terms of ideology, the Soviet revisionists, in order to serve their counter-revolutionary line of capitulationism, also vigorously promoted so-called "love," "humanitarianism," "anti-war movements," "unity and solidarity of mankind" in the "general declaration" of the bogus "Third Congress." This is completely revisionist goods because they obviously do not distinguish between exploiters and the exploited, oppressors and the oppressed, robbers and the robbed, and do not distinguish between enemies and friends, but indiscriminately promote "love" and "unity and solidarity" between them.

This is the essence of revisionism. It is like opium, numbing the exploited, oppressed, invaded, and robbed, attempting to achieve compromise and reconciliation between them and the exploiters, oppressors, invaders, and robbers, to the benefit of the latter. This is how the Soviet revisionists betray the revolutionary cause of the Afro-Asian peoples, sell out the interests and achievements of the Soviet people gained through the great October Socialist Revolution led by the great Lenin, and allow American and other Western monopolists to invest in Soviet industrial enterprises, develop capitalism in the Soviet Union, and exploit the Soviet people. This is the policy pursued by the Soviet revisionists as agents of U.S. imperialism to restore capitalism in the Soviet Union and achieve U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world. This is the line of capitulationism they advocated at the bogus congress in Beirut.

In terms of organization, the Soviet revisionists, in order to promote their reactionary and capitulationist political line, established at the bogus "Third Congress" a so-called "Afro-Asian Writers' Association" to be funded by UNESCO and prepare to admit the United States as a "guest member." However, because we have already exposed this dirty deal in our previous statements, the Soviet revisionists did not dare to openly discuss and pass it at the congress, and they did not dare to mention this organization that embodies U.S.-Soviet cultural cooperation in the "general declaration." Here, it can be seen that the Soviet revisionists are guilty, and all this also shows how the Soviet revisionists use covert means to realize their dirty conspiracies.

This bogus congress also exposed the Soviet revisionists' political conspiracy to collude with the United States against China. In the "general declaration," the Soviet revisionists were so eager to peddle the "peace talks" conspiracy and serve U.S. imperialism, but they maliciously and frantically slandered and attacked the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat, which has had a tremendous and far-reaching impact on the Afro-Asian peoples and the world revolutionary peoples. However, "an ant trying to shake a tree is futile." The Soviet revisionists, apart from exposing their fear of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, cannot harm the great revolutionary cause of the Chinese people by even a hair, nor can they harm the great revolutionary cause of the Afro-Asian peoples by even a hair!

From the political, ideological, and organizational white flags raised by the Soviet revisionists at the bogus "Third Congress," it is clear that the Soviet revisionists want to use the bogus "Third Congress" to promote U.S.-Soviet cultural cooperation and consolidate their counter-revolutionary "sacred U.S.-Soviet alliance," further conspiring to sabotage and betray the revolutionary cause of the Afro-Asian peoples. As we pointed out in the statement issued on March 21st: the Soviet revisionists are "lifting a stone to drop on their own feet," and now they have further exposed their ugly face of splitism and capitulationism. They have been strongly denounced and condemned by countless Afro-Asian writers and peoples and have suffered another defeat. However, the Soviet revisionists are not willing to accept their failure, so we must not let down our guard. We call on all progressive and revolutionary writers and peoples of Asia and Africa to further expose the betrayal and conspiracies of the Soviet revisionists. We must press the advantage!

Regarding the revolutionary Third Afro-Asian Writers' Congress scheduled to be held in Beijing this year, in recent days, more than forty writers' organizations, nationalist parties, progressive and revolutionary writers, and freedom fighters from Afro-Asian countries have issued statements expressing their support for this congress. Statements, communiqués, and press talks expressing support for us continue to arrive at our office, and we will not disappoint their hopes. The Permanent Bureau will definitely work with the host country to ensure the success of the "Third Congress." The great victory achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong has created very favorable conditions for us to successfully hold the "Third Congress." We will definitely, together with the progressive and revolutionary writers of Asia and Africa, thoroughly smash the line of splitism and capitulationism of the Soviet revisionists and make greater contributions to the revolutionary cause of the Afro-Asian peoples' unity against imperialism.

    亚非作家常设局号召彻底清算苏修召开伪“三大”出卖亚非革命事业的罪行
    坚决拔掉苏修投降分裂主义的白旗
    为亚非人民革命事业作出更大贡献
    中国文化大革命为今年在北京开好亚非作家大会创造有利条件
    新华社十五日讯　亚非作家常设局十三日就贝鲁特伪“第三届亚非作家大会”发表了一项题为《乘胜追击》的声明。声明全文如下：
    由苏联修正主义领导集团策划的在贝鲁特召开的非法和分裂的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”，在重重的矛盾、困难和混乱中，于一九六七年三月二十九日急急忙忙地草草收场了。
    这次伪会议对苏联修正主义者来说是玩火自焚，是他们反动的、反革命的投降主义路线的一次大暴露。
    亚非作家常设局为此向亚非所有进步的和革命的作家、民族解放组织、其他进步组织和进步的国际组织，表示深切的敬意和无限的钦佩，他们响应了我们的呼吁，给苏修分裂主义者以沉重的打击；他们不仅拒绝出席贝鲁特会议的邀请，而且发表了庄严的声明、新闻公报和记者谈话，抨击和强烈谴责这一反对亚非进步和革命的作家和人民的阴谋诡计。
    锡兰作家协会、锡兰青年作家协会、锡兰亚非团结协会、中国作家协会、中国亚非团结委员会、日本亚非作家会议协议会、巴基斯坦作家同人会、巴基斯坦亚非人民团结组织、塞内加尔亚非作家联络委员会、索马里作家协会、索马里记者协会、苏丹自由笔会、叙利亚亚非作家联络委员会、坦桑尼亚作家协会；印度尼西亚、日本、马来亚、泰国和土耳其的进步和革命的作家；安哥拉民族主义组织、阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会党、贝专纳人民党、巴苏陀兰大会党、加那利群岛争取自决和独立运动总书记处、莫三鼻给革命委员会、莫三鼻给非洲民族联盟、斯威士兰进步党、西南非洲民族联盟；亚非新闻工作者协会、亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会等组织发表了公开声明和对记者谈话，抨击和谴责在贝鲁特召开的这一非法的、分裂的伪会议。
    安哥拉、阿扎尼亚、巴苏陀兰、博茨瓦纳、喀麦隆、锡兰、中国、印度尼西亚、伊朗、日本、约旦、马来亚、莫三鼻给、尼日尔、北加里曼丹、西南非、苏丹、泰国、也门和津巴布韦等二十个国家和地区的革命作家、新闻工作者和自由战士，发表了一个联合声明，谴责贝鲁特伪会议。
    此外，柬埔寨、刚果（布）、几内亚、马里、巴基斯坦和许多其他国家的作家组织，也完全抵制了在贝鲁特召开的这一非法和分裂的伪会议。
    除上述之外，处在欧洲反帝反修斗争前哨的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚的作家也给了我们战斗的支持。
    在伪“三大”召开之前，修正主义者一再吹嘘，说什么来自七十个亚非国家的三百名代表将出席这次会议。实际上出席会议的只有三十多个亚非国家的一百多一点的人，而苏修代表团和其他三个国家的代表团就占了总数的一半以上。
    从出席伪会议的寥寥无几的国家和人数，以及那么多的亚非国家的作家组织、作家、民族主义政党发表了那么多的声明，谴责伪“三大”，就可以清楚地看出苏修反动的投降主义路线的无济于事、惨败和完全的孤立。
    就在出席会议的人中，除一小撮苏修的傀儡以外，有一些是屈从于他们的压力，有一些是受欺骗而去的，还有一些则是美帝国主义的走狗。值得注意的是，联合国教科文组织的秘书长也包括在这次伪会议的邀请之列，而苏修就是为了实现它的阴谋曾向那个秘书长乞求过财经援助的。
    分析一下伪“三大”以前苏修在开罗伪筹备会上发言中所暴露出来的目的，伪“三大”上由他们炮制出来的总报告，苏修代表团团长在伪会议上的发言，伪会议结束前所发表的“总宣言”，以及与会者对以上一切的反映，就可以看出伪“三大”是苏修为了实现美苏文化合作、巩固“美苏神圣同盟”而树起的一面白旗，是苏修企图出卖亚非人民革命事业的又一个严重的罪行。
    这里必须回顾一下，在开罗的伪筹备会上，没有发表一个文件，甚至没有讲一个词句来谴责以美国为首的帝国主义或支持亚非人民的反帝斗争。
    作为修正主义这种背叛的一个继续，在伪“三大”的总报告中，或在苏修代表团的讲话中，或在伪会议结束前最后发表的“总宣言”中，没有用一个词句来谴责美帝在越南的罪行，或者支持著名的越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明的正义立场，没有支持胡志明主席的著名的号召书。相反地，苏修却遵循着赤裸裸背叛越南人民神圣事业的道路，支持美帝国主义者策划的、旨在逼迫越南人民放下武器向美帝投降的“和平谈判”。伪“三大”的“总宣言”“要求立即停止在越南野蛮的轰炸和美国侵略的逐步升级”，这就赤裸裸地暴露了苏修为美帝效劳、为美帝兜售“和谈”的阴谋。目前，正当美帝国主义在按照关岛会议决定的方针，疯狂地扩大侵越战争的时候，苏修不要求从南越全部撤出所有的美国军队和它的仆从军队，撤除美国在南越所有的军事基地；不要求美国从越南滚出去，让南越人民来根据越南南方民族解放阵线的方案解决他们自己的事情，而任从美国侵略者继续霸占着越南的国土，继续赖在越南南方不走，只要求什么“和平谈判”，要求什么立即停止轰炸和战争“升级”，这同吴丹最近为美帝兜售的所谓“新建议”不是同一个货色吗？这实际上是在为美国扩大侵略战争、迫使越南人民在美国的炸弹和大炮的压力下向美国侵略者屈膝投降的阴谋打掩护。这充分暴露了苏修领导集团在越南问题上投降美帝、出卖越南人民神圣的抗美救国斗争的叛徒面目。
    在支持巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民反对美帝侵略工具以色列的问题上，苏修也象在越南问题上一样赤裸裸地暴露了它出卖阿拉伯人民革命事业的丑恶面目，因而遭到了来自阿拉伯国家的与会者的反对。苏修的代表团故意避而不谈巴勒斯坦人民斗争的实质，不但没有谴责美帝的侵略罪行，反而伙同印度代表团在伪会议上处心积虑地破坏巴勒斯坦人民真正的愿望。他们辩解说，他们所以采取这种立场，是因为他们对巴勒斯坦问题还“没有研究”，他们所感兴趣的只是文学和诗歌，而不是政治。
    我们暂且不说苏修所感兴趣的是什么样的“文学”和“诗歌”，我们要问，你们真的对政治不感兴趣么？当然，你们对革命的政治是不感兴趣的，而且是顽固地反对的。你们对反动政治是感兴趣的，你们不但感兴趣，而且是醉心的。你们对支持巴勒斯坦人民的革命斗争不感兴趣，但是你们对跟以色列勾勾搭搭却感兴趣得很！你们不是已经承认了帝国主义侵略阿拉伯国家的工具——以色列是一个国家，并与之建立了外交关系吗？你们不是正从苏联派一批批人到以色列去定居吗？包括中国在内的其他国家都允许巴勒斯坦解放组织设立办事处，而你们为什么拒绝它在莫斯科设立办事处呢？阿拉伯人民和亚非其他各国人民要求消除以色列，而你们为什么有那么大的兴趣，特别是在阿拉伯国家大肆鼓吹什么“塔什干精神”，主张巴勒斯坦人民同美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列“和解”“和平共处”呢？你们实际上对这种政治很感兴趣。你们完全无视去年在北京召开的由五十三个亚非国家和地区以及五个亚非国际组织参加的支持越南人民反对美国侵略的亚非作家紧急会议上，提出的断绝同以色列的一切政治关系、从经济和文化上抵制以色列的要求，相反地你们却继续同以色列保持外交上和其他方面的关系，从而完全出卖了阿拉伯人民的神圣事业。你们有的是什么样的政治兴趣，不是清清楚楚了么？你们“只谈文学不谈政治”的阴谋不是已经完全暴露无遗了吗？
    亚非的革命作家不但对革命的政治关切，对革命的文学艺术也十分关切。他们认为政治和文艺是不可分割的。他们遵照伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的教导：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”因此，在北京紧急会议上，五十三个亚非国家和地区的一百六十多位作家代表，除了分别通过三十四项决议，坚决支持亚非各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争以外，还反复地对革命文艺的问题交换了意见，一致通过了一项“关于文学为反帝革命斗争服务的决议”。他们呼吁所有革命的亚非作家“创造和发展亚非反帝革命的、人民大众的、民族的新文化、新文艺，用群众喜闻乐见的民族形式歌颂亚非人民争取与维护民族独立的革命斗争”，而对于这些革命的文学艺术，苏联修正主义的作家也是不感兴趣的。他们最感兴趣的是到美帝国主义的头子肯尼迪的坟墓上去献花圈，是写象《是的城市和否的城市》那种无耻地吹捧西方资本主义的“诗歌”。这是地地道道的叛徒的反革命的政治活动！我们必须指出：苏联修正主义者派这个臭名远扬的叛徒“诗人”叶夫图申科从肯尼迪的坟墓到贝鲁特参加伪“三大”，绝不是偶然的。这个修正主义的典型代表是苏修在伪“三大”上树起的一面白旗。他在给伪会议一个贺电中说什么“现在西方已不是过去的西方，东方也不象过去的东方。当两者互相接近的时候，它们就已经合到一起了。”这是苏修对于美苏文化合作、反革命的“美苏神圣同盟”的自供状，这是他们投降美帝国主义、证实他们同美帝国主义“和平共处”的理论的自白书。这暴露了苏修召开伪“三大”的真正目的，这是伪“三大”的真正的“总宣言”。
    在思想方面，苏修为了为反革命的投降主义的政治服务，在伪“三大”的“总宣言”里也大肆宣扬所谓“博爱”呀，“人道主义”呀，“反战运动”呀，“人类的团结和统一”呀，这完全是修正主义的货色，因为它们明显地不区分剥削者和被剥削者、压迫者和被压迫者、抢劫者和被抢劫者，不区分敌友，而是毫无区别地宣扬他们之间的“博爱”和“团结和统一”。
    这是修正主义的本质，它象鸦片一样麻痹被剥削者、被压迫者、被侵略者和被抢劫者，试图在他们和剥削者、压迫者、侵略者、抢劫者之间实现妥协和调和，以利于后者。苏联修正主义者就是这样地来背叛亚非人民的革命事业，来出卖苏联人民通过伟大的列宁所领导的伟大的十月社会主义革命而取得的利益和成果的，就是这样地让美国和其他西方的垄断资本家对苏联工业企业进行投资，在苏联发展资本主义，剥削苏联人民。这就是苏联修正主义者作为美帝的代理人所贯彻的在苏联复辟资本主义、实现美苏合作主宰世界的政策。这就是他们在贝鲁特伪会议上所鼓吹的投降主义的路线。
    在组织上，苏联修正主义者为了推行它的反动的和投降主义的政治路线，在伪“三大”上成立了一个将由联合国教科文组织资助的、准备吸收美国作为“客人会员”参加的所谓的“亚非作家协会”。但是，由于我们已经在过去的声明中揭露了这个肮脏的买卖，苏联修正主义者不敢把它在大会上公开地讨论和通过，他们在“总宣言”中也只字不敢提这个体现美苏文化合作的组织。这里看得出苏修做贼心虚，这一切也表明了苏联修正主义者是怎样采取隐蔽的手法，来实现他们的肮脏的阴谋的。
    这次伪会议还暴露了苏修联美反华的政治阴谋。在“总宣言”中，苏修是那么起劲地兜售“和谈”阴谋，为美帝效劳，而对震动世界、对亚非人民和世界人民革命有巨大和深远影响的中国无产阶级文化大革命，却恶毒地、疯狂地影射攻击。但是“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”，苏联修正主义者除了暴露自己害怕中国的文化大革命外，损伤不了伟大的中国人民革命事业的一根毫毛，损伤不了伟大的亚非人民革命事业的一根毫毛！
    从苏修在伪“三大”上所树起的政治、思想、组织的白旗，我们可以看出，苏修是想通过召开伪“三大”大搞美苏文化合作，巩固他们的反革命的“美苏神圣同盟”，进一步阴谋破坏和出卖亚非人民的革命事业。正如我们在三月二十一日发表的声明所指出的：苏修只是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，现在他们进一步暴露了自己的分裂主义和投降主义路线的丑恶面目。他们遭到无数亚非作家和人民的强烈声讨和谴责，遭到了又一个惨败。但是，苏修是不甘心于他们的失败的，因此我们决不能失去警惕。我们呼吁所有的亚非进步和革命的作家和人民进一步揭露苏修的背叛和阴谋。我们一定要乘胜追击！
    关于定在今年在北京召开的革命的第三届亚非作家大会，这些天来已有四十多个亚非国家的作家组织、民族主义政党、进步和革命的作家、自由战士纷纷发表声明，表示拥护这个大会，对我们表示拥护的声明、公报、对记者谈话不断地寄到我们的办公室，我们一定不辜负他们的希望。我们常设局一定和东道国一起确保“三大”的成功。由伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利，给我们开好“三大”创造了十分有利的条件。我们将一定同亚非进步和革命的作家一道，彻底粉碎苏修分裂主义和投降主义的路线，为亚非人民团结反帝的革命事业做出更大的贡献。
