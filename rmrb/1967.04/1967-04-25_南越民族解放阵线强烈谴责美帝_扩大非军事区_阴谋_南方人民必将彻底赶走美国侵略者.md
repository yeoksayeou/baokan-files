The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam strongly condemns the U.S. imperialist plot to "expand the demilitarized zone." The people of the South will surely drive out the U.S. aggressors.

	Hanoi, April 24 — According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's Foreign Liaison Committee issued a statement on April 23 strongly condemning the recent U.S. imperialist scheme to "expand the demilitarized zone." The statement emphasizes that this cunning "proposal" by U.S. imperialism is a preparation for it to strengthen and expand its aggression in Vietnam.

	The statement points out that for a long time, U.S. imperialism and its puppet regime have been scheming to turn the temporary military demarcation line into a permanent border dividing Vietnam, while turning the southern part of the demilitarized zone and its adjacent areas into a bridgehead for launching a war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	The statement points out that in recent times, U.S. imperialism and its puppet regime, in order to salvage their failures and continue their aggressive plots, have been intensively conducting continuous "sweeps" in the southern part of the demilitarized zone and its adjacent areas. They have been spreading chemical poisons, using various types of aircraft, including B-52 bombers, to bomb and destroy villages, in an attempt to annihilate the liberation armed forces. They have also been using cannons stationed south of the demilitarized zone to shell the northern part, blatantly violating the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. They are also concentrating residents and destroying villages, attempting to create a vast "no-man's-land" along the temporary military demarcation line. These facts expose the U.S. imperialist "proposal" to "expand the demilitarized zone" as merely a deceitful tactic aimed at deceiving public opinion, covering up its crimes of aggression, and preparing for it to escalate its aggression in South Vietnam and its war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	The statement says that the Foreign Liaison Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fully supports the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on April 21, 1967, and resolutely opposes and condemns the above-mentioned evil plots and actions of U.S. imperialism.

	The statement says that U.S. imperialism is the aggressor and must stop its aggression. It must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing, strafing, and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It must withdraw its troops not only from the demilitarized zone but from all of South Vietnam.

	The statement says that as long as U.S. imperialism does not abandon its policy of aggression, the people of South Vietnam will continue to promote their national liberation struggle and will surely drive out the U.S. aggressors from South Vietnam.

    南越民族解放阵线强烈谴责美帝“扩大非军事区”阴谋
    南方人民必将彻底赶走美国侵略者
    新华社河内二十四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会二十三日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义最近玩弄所谓“扩大非军事区”的阴谋。声明强调指出，美帝国主义的这一狡诈“建议”，是为它加强和扩大侵越战争作准备。
    声明指出，长期以来，美帝国主义及其走狗集团就阴谋把临时军事分界线地区变成一条长期分割越南的“国界线”，同时把非军事区南部及其相连地区变成准备对越南民主共和国发动战争的桥头堡。
    声明指出，最近以来，美帝国主义及其走狗集团为了挽救它们的失败和继续推行侵略阴谋，正加紧在非军事区南部及其相连地区进行连续不断的“扫荡”，撒放化学毒药，使用包括B—52型飞机在内的各种飞机进行轰炸，摧毁村庄，妄图消灭解放武装力量。它们还使用设在非军事区以南的大炮轰击非军事区以北地区，明目张胆地侵犯越南民主共和国领土。它们还正在加紧集中居民，摧毁村庄，妄图沿着临时军事分界线建立一个广大的“无人区”。这些事实暴露了美帝国主义的所谓“扩大非军事区”的建议，只不过是一种狡诈的手段，目的是为了欺骗舆论，掩盖它的侵略罪行，并且为它加强对越南南方的侵略战争和对越南民主共和国进行战争“升级”作准备。
    声明说，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会完全支持越南民主共和国外交部一九六七年四月二十一日的声明，坚决反对并谴责美帝国主义的上述罪恶阴谋和行动。
    声明说，美帝国主义是侵略者，它必须停止侵略。它必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸、扫射和其他一切战争行动。它必须把军队不仅从非军事区，而且从整个越南南方全部撤走。
    声明说，美帝国主义一天不肯放弃它的侵略政策，越南南方人民就要继续促进自己的救国抗战，并且必将彻底地把美国侵略者从越南南方赶出去。
