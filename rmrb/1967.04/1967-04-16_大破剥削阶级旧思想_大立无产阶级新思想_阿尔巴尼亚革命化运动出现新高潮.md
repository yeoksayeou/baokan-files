The heroic people of Albania, under the correct leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labour, have, since the beginning of this year, vigorously advanced the revolutionization movement in the political, ideological, economic, and cultural spheres. They have been marching forward along the path of revolutionization, and the entire nation has been filled with a vigorous revolutionary atmosphere.

The revolutionization movement in Albania has reached a new high since Comrade Hoxha delivered his important report on "Further Revolutionizing the Party and the State" on February 6. A nationwide mass movement has been launched to eliminate old ideas, customs, and habits, and to establish new ideas, customs, and habits, thereby bringing about a profound change in the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of the people.

Revolutionary Youth Take the Lead
Bravely Opposing Old Ideas

Under the guidance of the Party and Comrade Hoxha, the revolutionary youth of the "Vlasheri" Middle School in the Durres District have come to realize that class struggle still exists in socialist society and that they must actively participate in the class struggle on the ideological front to become the successors of the revolutionary cause. They were the first to establish a "Revolutionary Command Center to Oppose Religious Superstition, Prejudice, and Backward Customs" and bravely sweep away the mud and dirt left over from the old society. The revolutionary youth of the "Zeneli" Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Gjirokaster District saw that there were still phenomena of disregarding and not respecting women within the cooperative, and they were the first to rise up and fight against feudal remnants and backward customs. Following the revolutionary actions of these two units, a surging mass revolutionary movement to smash the old and establish the new quickly spread throughout the country. Workers, peasants, youth, women, and the elderly all wrote letters to Comrade Hoxha expressing their common fighting aspirations: to bravely oppose old ideas and wage an uncompromising struggle against old things, and to march forward along the path of revolutionization indicated by the Party. The youth of Mirdita District have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, and have waged a fierce struggle against reactionary religious forces, exposing priests who engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, to the great delight of the people, who enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Comrade Hoxha! Ten thousand years!"

Women from various places also bravely stood up to struggle, breaking free from the various shackles left over from the old society, and actively participated in voluntary labor and political activities. Early marriages and arranged marriages and other backward customs have been condemned by the people nationwide. Mass rallies were held in many places to denounce the crimes of feudal remnants and backward customs, and feudal marriage contracts were torn up on the spot. Many parents and elders also wrote letters to Comrade Hoxha expressing their determination to establish new socialist family relationships and carry out the struggle to change customs and habits.

Cadres and Masses Raise Awareness
Voluntarily Abolishing Extra Allowances

Under the guidance of the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania and the instructions of Comrade Hoxha, the broad revolutionary masses have waged a fierce struggle against bourgeois individualist ideas such as pursuing money and enjoyment, and seeking a life of luxury, comfort, and ease. This is an important aspect of the deepening of the revolutionization movement in Albania at present.

The broad membership of agricultural production cooperatives have continuously raised their ideological awareness in the revolutionization movement. They voluntarily reduced their private plots and private livestock, thereby expanding the collective economy. Members of some newly established agricultural production cooperatives in the mountainous areas of Mirdita and Kukes voluntarily turned over all their livestock to the agricultural production cooperatives for use without compensation, and reduced their private plots from the stipulated 0.3 hectares to 0.1 hectares.

Recently, the editorial staff of the newspaper "Unity" proposed the revolutionary initiative to abolish manuscript fees, which immediately received widespread support and response from revolutionary masses of all strata. They successively proposed the abolition of more than ten kinds of extra allowances, such as royalties for reprinted literary works, on-call allowances for medical workers outside working hours, bonuses for inventions and rationalization suggestions, and monthly allowances for members of the People's Assembly. Their revolutionary actions were warmly supported and highly appreciated by the Council of Ministers. Dr. Zhuliri of the BrezhdÃ« Hospital said, "We do not need extra allowances. For us medical workers, the greatest reward is to protect the health of the people." Recently, the Union of Writers and Artists of Albania unanimously adopted the proposal of the Party branch of the Union of Writers and Artists to abolish all literary creation remuneration, such as manuscript fees, state prizes, and literary awards. They also expressed their determination to create more and better works for the people and the Party.

At present, actively participating in voluntary labor and vigorously supporting agricultural production has become a noble custom of the entire nation. About 140,000 young intellectuals and young workers and peasants across the country have signed up to participate in the construction of railways and highways. Thousands of young intellectuals, cadres, and employees have voluntarily signed up to work in mountainous agricultural production cooperatives for one to three years, and now more than a thousand volunteers have gone to the front lines of agricultural production. Young doctor Qintsi said, "As a doctor, we should go to the countryside, we should be concerned about what the people are concerned about, and we should feel what the people feel."

Using Revolutionary Big-Character Posters
To Promote Ideological Revolutionization

Building on the great achievements of last year's struggle against bureaucratism, the broad revolutionary masses of Albania are currently using revolutionary big-character posters to deepen the struggle against bureaucratism, implement the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses," expand socialist democracy, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

At present, the primary Party organizations of the Party of Labour of Albania, as well as trade unions, the League of Labour Youth, and other mass organizations are conducting summary and election work. Party organizations at all levels are actively implementing Comrade Hoxha's instructions to activate Party life, strictly adhere to Party principles, boldly carry out criticism and self-criticism, expose and criticize bureaucrats and those who have degenerated and changed quality, examine the attitudes of leading cadres and organizational members at all levels towards the revolutionary cause and collective interests, towards labor and life, and towards the masses and women, and smash various non-proletarian ideas. Many Party members, workers, and cooperative members have, through big-character posters and meetings, carried out mass criticism of various forms of bourgeois ideas and styles, such as being detached from the masses, despising manual labor, arrogance, and commandism, and have effectively promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking.

The "Hoxha" Mechanical Factory in Tirana, named after the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Hoxha, has, since last year's struggle against bureaucratism, seen significant changes in the work methods and styles of its cadres. The leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel of this factory proposed at the beginning of this year the initiative to spend three months each year participating in manual labor. They work with the workers, operate together, listen to the opinions of the worker masses, and humbly learn from the workers. In this way, not only has the relationship between workers and leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel been strengthened, but many difficulties in production have also been solved.

Literature and Art Serve the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
Mass Production of Revolutionary Works

At present, the series of revolutionization measures adopted by the Party of Labour of Albania to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, carry out class struggle, highlight proletarian politics, implement the mass line, strengthen revolutionary education, and resolutely carry the socialist revolution to the end, are becoming a powerful material force, promoting the rapid development of socialist construction. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals, are all striving with revolutionary enthusiasm to complete the great tasks set by the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour, and have achieved great successes in agricultural production, industrial production, and in the fields of culture and education. On the literary and artistic front, due to the series of measures taken by the Party of Labour to promote the revolutionization of literature and art, a new situation has emerged. Workers, peasants, and soldiers have taken to the literary and artistic stage, performing programs they themselves created that are rich in revolutionary educational significance. In the context of the thriving national revolutionization movement, professional literary and artistic troupes are also striving to make literature and art better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. More and more literary and artistic troupes are going down to factories, down to the countryside, and deep into the mountains and villages to perform for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The heroic deeds of the great communist warrior Adam ReÃ§ka have become the subject of creation for writers and artists, and dramas, poems, and songs praising ReÃ§ka have appeared.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said in his message to the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania: "The glorious Party of Labour of Albania, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, firmly holds high the red flag of Marxism-Leninism in the midst of the encirclement of imperialism and modern revisionism." "Heroic Albania, the people's Albania, has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe." Looking at Albania today, thunder roars, victory songs resound, and everywhere there is a scene of vigorous and spirited revolution. Under the wise leadership of Comrade Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania, the heroic Albanian people, with a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, are overcoming all difficulties on the road ahead, riding the wind and waves forward, from victory to victory!
