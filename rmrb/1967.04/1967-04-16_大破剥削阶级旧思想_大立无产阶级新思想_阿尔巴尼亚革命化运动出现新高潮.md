The heroic people of Albania, under the correct leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labour, have, since the beginning of this year, vigorously advanced the revolutionization movement in the political, ideological, economic, and cultural spheres. They have been marching forward along the path of revolutionization, and the entire nation has been filled with a vigorous revolutionary atmosphere.

The revolutionization movement in Albania has reached a new high since Comrade Hoxha delivered his important report on "Further Revolutionizing the Party and the State" on February 6. A nationwide mass movement has been launched to eliminate old ideas, customs, and habits, and to establish new ideas, customs, and habits, thereby bringing about a profound change in the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of the people.

Revolutionary Youth Take the Lead
Bravely Opposing Old Ideas

Under the guidance of the Party and Comrade Hoxha, the revolutionary youth of the "Vlasheri" Middle School in the Durres District have come to realize that class struggle still exists in socialist society and that they must actively participate in the class struggle on the ideological front to become the successors of the revolutionary cause. They were the first to establish a "Revolutionary Command Center to Oppose Religious Superstition, Prejudice, and Backward Customs" and bravely sweep away the mud and dirt left over from the old society. The revolutionary youth of the "Zeneli" Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Gjirokaster District saw that there were still phenomena of disregarding and not respecting women within the cooperative, and they were the first to rise up and fight against feudal remnants and backward customs. Following the revolutionary actions of these two units, a surging mass revolutionary movement to smash the old and establish the new quickly spread throughout the country. Workers, peasants, youth, women, and the elderly all wrote letters to Comrade Hoxha expressing their common fighting aspirations: to bravely oppose old ideas and wage an uncompromising struggle against old things, and to march forward along the path of revolutionization indicated by the Party. The youth of Mirdita District have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, and have waged a fierce struggle against reactionary religious forces, exposing priests who engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, to the great delight of the people, who enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Comrade Hoxha! Ten thousand years!"

Women from various places also bravely stood up to struggle, breaking free from the various shackles left over from the old society, and actively participated in voluntary labor and political activities. Early marriages and arranged marriages and other backward customs have been condemned by the people nationwide. Mass rallies were held in many places to denounce the crimes of feudal remnants and backward customs, and feudal marriage contracts were torn up on the spot. Many parents and elders also wrote letters to Comrade Hoxha expressing their determination to establish new socialist family relationships and carry out the struggle to change customs and habits.

Cadres and Masses Raise Awareness
Voluntarily Abolishing Extra Allowances

Under the guidance of the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania and the instructions of Comrade Hoxha, the broad revolutionary masses have waged a fierce struggle against bourgeois individualist ideas such as pursuing money and enjoyment, and seeking a life of luxury, comfort, and ease. This is an important aspect of the deepening of the revolutionization movement in Albania at present.

The broad membership of agricultural production cooperatives have continuously raised their ideological awareness in the revolutionization movement. They voluntarily reduced their private plots and private livestock, thereby expanding the collective economy. Members of some newly established agricultural production cooperatives in the mountainous areas of Mirdita and Kukes voluntarily turned over all their livestock to the agricultural production cooperatives for use without compensation, and reduced their private plots from the stipulated 0.3 hectares to 0.1 hectares.

Recently, the editorial staff of the newspaper "Unity" proposed the revolutionary initiative to abolish manuscript fees, which immediately received widespread support and response from revolutionary masses of all strata. They successively proposed the abolition of more than ten kinds of extra allowances, such as royalties for reprinted literary works, on-call allowances for medical workers outside working hours, bonuses for inventions and rationalization suggestions, and monthly allowances for members of the People's Assembly. Their revolutionary actions were warmly supported and highly appreciated by the Council of Ministers. Dr. Zhuliri of the Brezhdë Hospital said, "We do not need extra allowances. For us medical workers, the greatest reward is to protect the health of the people." Recently, the Union of Writers and Artists of Albania unanimously adopted the proposal of the Party branch of the Union of Writers and Artists to abolish all literary creation remuneration, such as manuscript fees, state prizes, and literary awards. They also expressed their determination to create more and better works for the people and the Party.

At present, actively participating in voluntary labor and vigorously supporting agricultural production has become a noble custom of the entire nation. About 140,000 young intellectuals and young workers and peasants across the country have signed up to participate in the construction of railways and highways. Thousands of young intellectuals, cadres, and employees have voluntarily signed up to work in mountainous agricultural production cooperatives for one to three years, and now more than a thousand volunteers have gone to the front lines of agricultural production. Young doctor Qintsi said, "As a doctor, we should go to the countryside, we should be concerned about what the people are concerned about, and we should feel what the people feel."

Using Revolutionary Big-Character Posters
To Promote Ideological Revolutionization

Building on the great achievements of last year's struggle against bureaucratism, the broad revolutionary masses of Albania are currently using revolutionary big-character posters to deepen the struggle against bureaucratism, implement the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses," expand socialist democracy, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

At present, the primary Party organizations of the Party of Labour of Albania, as well as trade unions, the League of Labour Youth, and other mass organizations are conducting summary and election work. Party organizations at all levels are actively implementing Comrade Hoxha's instructions to activate Party life, strictly adhere to Party principles, boldly carry out criticism and self-criticism, expose and criticize bureaucrats and those who have degenerated and changed quality, examine the attitudes of leading cadres and organizational members at all levels towards the revolutionary cause and collective interests, towards labor and life, and towards the masses and women, and smash various non-proletarian ideas. Many Party members, workers, and cooperative members have, through big-character posters and meetings, carried out mass criticism of various forms of bourgeois ideas and styles, such as being detached from the masses, despising manual labor, arrogance, and commandism, and have effectively promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking.

The "Hoxha" Mechanical Factory in Tirana, named after the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Hoxha, has, since last year's struggle against bureaucratism, seen significant changes in the work methods and styles of its cadres. The leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel of this factory proposed at the beginning of this year the initiative to spend three months each year participating in manual labor. They work with the workers, operate together, listen to the opinions of the worker masses, and humbly learn from the workers. In this way, not only has the relationship between workers and leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel been strengthened, but many difficulties in production have also been solved.

Literature and Art Serve the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
Mass Production of Revolutionary Works

At present, the series of revolutionization measures adopted by the Party of Labour of Albania to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, carry out class struggle, highlight proletarian politics, implement the mass line, strengthen revolutionary education, and resolutely carry the socialist revolution to the end, are becoming a powerful material force, promoting the rapid development of socialist construction. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals, are all striving with revolutionary enthusiasm to complete the great tasks set by the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour, and have achieved great successes in agricultural production, industrial production, and in the fields of culture and education. On the literary and artistic front, due to the series of measures taken by the Party of Labour to promote the revolutionization of literature and art, a new situation has emerged. Workers, peasants, and soldiers have taken to the literary and artistic stage, performing programs they themselves created that are rich in revolutionary educational significance. In the context of the thriving national revolutionization movement, professional literary and artistic troupes are also striving to make literature and art better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. More and more literary and artistic troupes are going down to factories, down to the countryside, and deep into the mountains and villages to perform for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The heroic deeds of the great communist warrior Adam Reçka have become the subject of creation for writers and artists, and dramas, poems, and songs praising Reçka have appeared.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said in his message to the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania: "The glorious Party of Labour of Albania, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, firmly holds high the red flag of Marxism-Leninism in the midst of the encirclement of imperialism and modern revisionism." "Heroic Albania, the people's Albania, has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe." Looking at Albania today, thunder roars, victory songs resound, and everywhere there is a scene of vigorous and spirited revolution. Under the wise leadership of Comrade Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania, the heroic Albanian people, with a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, are overcoming all difficulties on the road ahead, riding the wind and waves forward, from victory to victory!

    大破剥削阶级旧思想　大立无产阶级新思想
    阿尔巴尼亚革命化运动出现新高潮
    新华社地拉那十五日电　本社记者报道：今年以来，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，在政治、思想、经济和文化等方面进一步深入开展革命化运动，沿着革命化的道路奋勇前进。全国出现一派蓬蓬勃勃的革命局面。
    阿尔巴尼亚的革命化运动，在霍查同志二月六日作了关于“党和政权的进一步革命化”的重要报告以后，出现了新的高潮。全国掀起了一个破除旧思想、旧风俗和旧习惯，树立新思想、新风俗和新习惯的群众性运动，从而使广大人民群众的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。
    革命青年当闯将
    勇敢反对旧思想
    都拉斯区“弗拉歇里”中学的革命青年在劳动党和霍查同志的教导下，认识到社会主义社会还存在着激烈的阶级斗争，必须积极参加思想战线上的阶级斗争，才能成为革命事业的接班人。于是，他们第一个起来成立了“反对宗教迷信、偏见和落后习惯的革命司令部”，勇敢地起来扫除旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水。吉诺卡斯特区泽内利农业生产合作社的革命青年看到生产合作社内还存在着轻视妇女和不尊重妇女的现象，首先起来造了封建残余和落后风俗的反。在这两个单位革命闯将的革命行动带动下，全国迅速形成了一个汹涌澎湃的破旧立新的群众革命运动。工人、农民、青年、妇女和老人纷纷写信给霍查同志，表达了他们的共同的战斗心愿：勇敢地反对旧思想，同旧事物展开不调和的斗争，沿着劳动党所指引的革命化道路奋勇前进。米尔迪塔区的青年们发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，同反动的宗教势力展开激烈斗争，揪出了从事反革命活动的神父，大快人心，人们兴奋地高呼：“霍查同志万岁！万万岁！”
    各地妇女也勇敢地起来斗争，摆脱了旧社会遗留下来的对她们的种种束缚，积极参加义务劳动和政治活动。早婚和包办买卖婚姻等落后风俗，受到全国人民的同声谴责，许多地区召开了群众大会，愤怒声讨封建残余和落后风俗的罪恶，当场撕毁了封建婚约。许多家长和老人还写信给霍查同志表示：一定要建立社会主义的新的家庭关系，开展移风易俗的斗争。
    干部群众觉悟提高
    自愿取消额外报酬
    在劳动党第五次代表大会决议和霍查同志指示的指引下，广大革命群众同贪图金钱、享受，追求奢侈、舒适、安逸生活等资产阶级个人主义思想展开了激烈斗争，在自己的头脑中大破资产阶级思想，大兴无产阶级思想。这是阿尔巴尼亚当前革命化运动深入发展的一个重要方面。
    农业生产合作社的广大社员在革命化运动中，思想觉悟不断提高。他们纷纷自动减少自留地和自留牲畜，因而扩大了集体经济。米尔迪塔和库克斯等山区的一些新成立的农业生产合作社社员，把自己的全部牲畜无偿地交给农业生产合作社使用，并把自留地从规定的零点三公顷降低到零点一公顷。
    《团结报》编辑部工作人员不久前提出了取消稿费的革命倡议，这个倡议立即得到各阶层革命群众的普遍支持和响应。他们先后提出了取消文艺作品再版费、医务工作者工作时间以外的值班报酬、发明和合理化建议的奖金以及人民议会议员每月的补助津贴等十多种额外报酬。他们的革命行动得到部长会议热烈支持和高度评价。布列尔医院医生朱唯里说：“我们不需要额外报酬。对于我们医务工作者来说，最大的报酬是保护人民的身体健康。”吉诺卡斯特五金厂的一位生产革新者马拉最近把凉鞋鞋扣的生产效率提高了十多倍，但是他拒绝接受任何额外报酬，他说：“搞好生产是我们工人阶级的本分，我还将尽我的一切力量努力工作。”最近，阿尔巴尼亚作家艺术家协会一致通过了作家艺术家协会党支部关于取消一切文艺创作报酬的建议，如稿费、共和国奖金和文艺评奖的奖金等，他们还表示要更多更好地为人民和党进行创作。
    目前，积极参加义务劳动和大力支援农业生产已经成为全国人民的崇高风尚。全国约有十四万名知识青年和工农青年报名参加铁路和公路建设。有数千名知识青年、机关干部和职工自愿报名到山区农业生产合作社劳动一至三年，现在已有上千名志愿者走上农业生产第一线。青年医生金茨说：“作为一个医生，我们要到农村去，要急人民之所急，痛人民之所痛。”
    运用革命大字报
    促进思想革命化
    阿尔巴尼亚广大革命群众在去年反官僚主义斗争取得巨大成绩的基础上，正通过革命的大字报，深入开展反官僚主义的斗争，贯彻“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线，扩大了社会主义的民主，巩固了无产阶级专政。
    目前阿尔巴尼亚劳动党各基层党组织以及工会、劳动青年联盟等群众组织正在进行总结和改选工作。各级党组织积极贯彻霍查同志关于活跃党内生活的指示，严格遵守党的准则，大胆地进行批评与自我批评，揭发批判官僚主义者和蜕化变质分子，检查各级领导干部和各组织成员对待革命事业和集体利益、对待劳动和生活、对待群众和妇女的态度，大破各种非无产阶级的思想。许多党员、工人群众和农业合作社社员通过大字报和会议等方式，对脱离群众、轻视体力劳动、高傲自大、命令主义等形形色色的资产阶级思想和作风进行了群众性的严厉批评，有力地促进了人的思想革命化。
    以阿尔巴尼亚人民的敬爱领袖霍查同志的名字命名的地拉那“霍查”机械厂，在去年开展反官僚主义斗争以来，干部的工作方法和工作作风都发生了很大的变化。这个厂的领导干部和工程技术人员今年年初提出每年用三个月的时间参加体力劳动的倡议。他们和工人一起上班，一起操作，倾听工人群众的意见，虚心地向工人学习，这样不但密切了工人和领导干部、工程技术人员之间的关系，而且解决了生产中的许多疑难问题。
    文艺为工农兵服务
    大量创作革命作品
    目前，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党所采取的巩固无产阶级专政、开展阶级斗争、突出无产阶级政治、贯彻群众路线、加强革命教育、坚决把社会主义革命进行到底等一系列革命化措施，正在变成强大的物质力量，推动着社会主义建设的迅速发展。广大工农兵和革命知识分子，都以冲天的革命干劲，为完成劳动党第五次代表大会提出的巨大任务而奋斗，不论是在农业生产、工业生产，还是在文化教育方面，都取得了巨大的成就。在文艺战线上，由于劳动党采取了一系列旨在促进文艺革命化的措施，出现了一派新的景象。工农兵登上了文艺舞台，演出了他们自己创作的富有革命教育意义的节目。在全国革命化运动蓬勃发展的大好形势下，专业文艺团体也在努力使文艺更好地为工农兵服务。越来越多的文艺团体下厂下乡，深入山区和农村为工农兵演出。伟大的共产主义战士亚当·雷卡的英雄事迹成了作家、艺术家创作的题材，出现了歌颂雷卡的戏剧、诗歌和歌曲。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中说过：“以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，在帝国主义和现代修正主义的重重包围之中，坚定地高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗。”“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”喜看今日的山鹰之国，春雷滚滚，凯歌阵阵，到处都是一派意气风发、斗志昂扬的革命景象。在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，正在克服前进道路上的一切困难，乘风破浪向前进，从胜利走向胜利！
