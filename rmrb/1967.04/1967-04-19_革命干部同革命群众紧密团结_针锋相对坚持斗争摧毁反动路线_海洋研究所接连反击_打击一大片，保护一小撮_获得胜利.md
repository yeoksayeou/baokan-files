Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses are closely united. They firmly oppose and struggle against the reactionary line, and the Marine Research Institute has achieved victory in repeatedly counterattacking the "strike a large number, protect a few" policy.

Revolutionary cadres and masses of the Chinese Academy of Marine Research, who have been persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line, have united closely under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have resolutely struggled against a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly smashing the reactionary line of the number one capitalist-roader within the party on the issue of cadres, which advocates "striking a large number, protecting a few." They have achieved great victories in the Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary cadres of the Marine Research Institute responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao and, in May last year, joined the revolutionary masses in launching a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution. Their struggle was directed against a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, exposing the ugly faces of these bad elements. At this time, the number one capitalist-roader within the party proposed and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, especially the reactionary policy of "striking a large number, protecting a few" on the issue of cadres, which perfectly suited the tastes of a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. They used the power they had usurped in the cultural revolution to reverse the direction of the struggle, pointing the spearhead at the broad revolutionary cadres, and stirring up a chaotic struggle throughout the institute. They shouted at big and small meetings: "Exposing problems is unrestricted by time, place, or whether it is within or outside the party, and whoever is involved is involved." They even more blatantly said: "Start exposing from the person you know best."

In this chaotic struggle they stirred up, all 180 party members in the institute were listed as targets for "sweeping away." Many cadres were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries." At that time, 66 people participated in the movement in the administrative unit, but only one was considered a "reliable leftist," while the rest were either labeled as "anti-party cliques" or "black gangs" or "black line" elements. The party branch of the administrative unit was labeled as the "Three Families Black Store," and three section-level cadres were each arbitrarily labeled as "anti-party elements," "ambitious plotters," "spies," "time bombs," and other fabricated crimes. Seven party branch secretaries and some section chiefs and deputy chiefs who stood with the revolutionary masses to expose their anti-party crimes were all labeled as "anti-party elements" and "counter-revolutionaries." Under their frenzied attacks, the Marine Research Institute was shrouded in a white terror. Statistics show that at that time, 25% of general cadres, 60% of middle-level cadres, and 50% of leading cadres were struck and persecuted, wearing various political hats.

However, revolutionary cadres who suffered severe strikes and persecution from the bourgeois reactionary line did not yield to this seemingly powerful reactionary force. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely engaged in a struggle against a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. A revolutionary cadre who was labeled as a "counter-revolutionary" and removed from the position of branch secretary faced them and sharply criticized: "You have the power to remove me from my position as branch secretary, but you do not have the power to shut my mouth. I will not stop until I expose your black deeds." More than ten cadres at the section and deputy section level who were struck and persecuted closely united in the most difficult times, supporting and encouraging each other. They wrote big-character posters, exposing with a large amount of facts the ugly faces of a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. Some young revolutionary cadres who were struck also stood up to expose the counter-revolutionary methods of a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, "striking a large number, protecting a few."

A handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road did not bow their heads and confess their crimes under the counterattacks of revolutionary cadres. Instead, they became even more vicious, plotting and instigating a part of the deceived masses and cadres to form a "protection" organization called the "Vanguard Squad," using it to protect themselves and continue to strike revolutionary cadres. They treated revolutionary cadres as "one step forward, one step back." At this time, revolutionary cadres again resolutely struggled against this "protection" organization. Many middle-level cadres who stood up formed the "Red Flag Combat Team" and stood with the proletarian revolutionary organization "Red Ocean Revolutionary Rebel Corps" to engage in a struggle against the "Vanguard Squad." They finally exposed the tricks played by a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, disbanded the "Vanguard Squad," and won over the majority of the deceived people. After these people returned to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they immediately launched a "counterattack," placing a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road in a completely isolated position, thoroughly exposing their counter-revolutionary faces.

Revolutionary cadres and proletarian revolutionaries of the Marine Research Institute, on the basis of smashing the bourgeois reactionary line, achieved the great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." They finally seized the leadership from a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and established the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ—the Revolutionary Committee. Many leading and middle-level cadres who were tested in the struggle were supported by the masses and elected to the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ. They played a significant role in grasping the revolution and promoting production.

    革命干部同革命群众紧密团结
    针锋相对坚持斗争摧毁反动路线
    海洋研究所接连反击“打击一大片，保护一小撮”获得胜利
    新华社济南十七日电　中国科学院海洋研究所受到资产阶级反动路线迫害的革命领导干部和中层干部，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，和广大革命群众紧密团结在一起，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作坚决的斗争，彻底粉碎党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在干部问题上搞的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动路线，取得了文化大革命的巨大胜利。
    海洋研究所的革命干部响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，在去年五月同革命群众一道，投入了轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动。他们的斗争矛头直指党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，揭露了这一小撮坏家伙的丑恶原形。这时，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出和推行资产阶级反动路线，特别是在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，正投合研究所党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的胃口。他们利用窃踞的文化革命的领导大权，扭转斗争方向，把矛头指向广大革命干部，在全所各级干部之间挑起了一场混战。他们在大会小会上叫嚣说：“揭发问题不分上下左右，不分党内党外，不管什么时间，不论什么地点，不受任何限制，涉及到谁就是谁。”他们甚至更露骨地说：“从你最熟悉的人开始揭起。”
    在他们挑起的这场混战中，全所一百八十名党员都被列为“横扫”对象，还有许多干部被打成“反革命分子”。行政单位当时参加运动的有六十六人，其中只有一人被认为是“可靠的左派”，其他不是被打成“反党集团”，就是被打成“黑帮”或“黑线”分子。行政单位的党支部被打成“三家村黑店”，三名处级干部分别被强加上“反党分子”、“野心家”、“内奸”、
  “定时炸弹”等莫须有的罪名。七个同革命群众站在一起揭发他们反党罪行的党支部书记和一些处长、科长，都被打成“反党分子”和“反革命分子”。在他们这样疯狂的打击下，海洋研究所笼罩着一片白色恐怖。据统计，当时全所有百分之二十五的一般干部，百分之六十的中层干部，百分之五十的领导干部受到打击和迫害，被戴上了各种名目的政治帽子。
    但是，遭受资产阶级反动路线严重打击和迫害的革命干部，并没有在这股貌似强大的反动势力面前屈服，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决地同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行了针锋相对的斗争。被打成“反革命”并且被停了支部书记职务的一位革命干部，面对面地痛斥党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派说：“你们有权停止我支部书记的职务，但是你们无权堵住我的嘴，不揭开你们的黑盖子，誓不罢休。”遭到打击和迫害的十多名处、科级以上干部，在最艰难的时刻紧密地结合在一起，互相支持，互相鼓励。他们写大字报，以大量事实揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的丑恶面目。还有一些被打击的青年革命干部，起来揭露了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反革命手法。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在革命干部的反击下，不但不低头认罪，反而变本加厉，阴谋策划，怂恿一部分受蒙蔽的群众和干部拼凑起一个保字号组织——“前卫大队”，用以保护自己，继续打击革命干部。他们对待革命干部是“站出一个就揪一个”。这时，革命干部又同这个保字号组织进行坚决的斗争。许多站出来的中层干部组成了“红旗战斗队”，同无产阶级革命派组织“红海洋革命造反团”站在一起，同“前卫大队”进行了针锋相对的斗争，最后戳穿了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所玩弄的阴谋诡计，瓦解了“前卫大队”，争取了其中绝大多数受蒙蔽的人。这些人回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边以后，立即大杀“回马枪”，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派处于完全孤立的地位，彻底暴露了他们的反革命面目。
    海洋研究所的革命干部和无产阶级革命派在粉碎资产阶级反动路线的基础上，实现了无产阶级革命派的大联合和革命的“三结合”，终于从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中胜利地夺回了领导权，建立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构——革命委员会。许多在斗争中经受了考验的革命领导干部和中层干部得到广大群众的拥护，被群众推选到革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构中来，他们在抓革命、促生产方面发挥了显著作用。
