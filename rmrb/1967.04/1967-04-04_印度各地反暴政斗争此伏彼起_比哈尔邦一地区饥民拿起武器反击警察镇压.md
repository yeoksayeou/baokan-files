    Anti-oppression struggles continue to flare up in various parts of India, with the masses engaging in violent resistance and strikes against the reactionary government.

    According to a report by the Indian News Agency on March 23, armed and hungry masses in Kosir village of Mangalur district, Bihar, forcibly harvested crops from the fields on March 21. When the police arrived to suppress them, the masses fired back in self-defense. According to the United News Agency, due to frequent attacks by armed Naga tribesmen on the railways, traffic between Lumding and Dibrugarh in Assam has been paralyzed.

    In Rajgangpur, Orissa, 500 workers demonstrated on March 18, demanding the reinstatement of dismissed workers. When the reactionary government's police opened fire on them, the workers bravely retaliated by throwing stones, injuring several policemen and a local official. In the clash, 30 workers were injured by the police.

    Approximately 5,000 workers at the Sudian Copper Company in Mosabani, Sural, and the Partakura mines in Bihar have been on strike since March 11 to protest the arbitrary dismissal of workers by the capitalists.

    Around 30,000 teachers from various schools in Delhi held a symbolic one-day hunger strike on March 20, demanding a revision of their salary grades. Additionally, nearly 10,000 workers in Maharashtra, where Mumbai, India's largest city, is located, demonstrated near the state legislature on March 17. They protested against the Indian reactionary government's policy of exploiting the masses and demanded improved living conditions. The demonstrators included employees of the *Indian Express*, one of India's largest newspaper publishing enterprises, who had been on strike since February 17 demanding temporary relief funds. Workers from enterprises under the Maharashtra Electricity Board also participated in the March 17 demonstration.

    Under the brutal oppression and exploitation of the Indian reactionary government, the Indian economy is deteriorating rapidly, famines are becoming more severe, prices are soaring, factories are closing, and people are finding it increasingly difficult to survive. Consequently, incidents of violent resistance against the reactionary government are on the rise.

    印度各地反暴政斗争此伏彼起
    比哈尔邦一地区饥民拿起武器反击警察镇压
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：印度一些地方群众继续开展反对反动政府的暴力斗争和罢工斗争。
    据印度报业托辣斯三月二十三日透露，比哈尔邦芒吉尔县二十一日有一些武装起来的饥饿的群众在科西尔村强行收割田里的庄稼，当警察赶来镇压他们时，他们向警察开枪还击进行自卫。据联合新闻社透露，由于最近那加族武装不断袭击铁路，阿萨姆邦的卢姆丁和迪布鲁加尔之间的交通陷于瘫痪。
    在奥里萨邦拉杰冈普尔，三月十八日五百名工人示威，要求让被解雇的工人复工，在反动政府的警察对他们开枪进行镇压时，工人英勇地向警察投掷石块还击，打伤了几名警察和一名地方行政官。在冲突中有三十名工人被警察打伤。
    在苏尔达的莫沙帕尼的苏迪安铜矿公司和比哈尔邦的帕尔特古拉矿山的大约五千名工人，为抗议资本家无理解雇工人从三月十一日开始罢工。
    德里各学校的大约三万名教师，在三月二十日举行一天象征性绝食，要求修改工资级别。此外印度第一大城市孟买所在的马哈拉施特拉邦近万名工人，三月十七日在邦议会附近举行示威，反对印度反动政府执行压榨广大群众的政策，要求改善生活待遇。
    参加示威的工人包括印度最大的报纸出版企业之一《印度时报》系统的职工。他们从二月十七日起就开始罢工要求发给临时救济金。马哈拉施特拉邦电业局所属企业的工人也参加了三月十七日的示威。
    在印度反动政府残酷的压迫和剥削下，印度经济加速恶化，饥荒越来越严重，物价飞涨，工厂倒闭，人民越来越活不下去，因而暴力反抗反动政府的事件越来越多。
