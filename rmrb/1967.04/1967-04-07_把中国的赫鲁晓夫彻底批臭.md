Stepen Kuo's article "Is It Patriotism or Treason?" has sounded the battle call to politically and ideologically overthrow the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. The black words exposed by Stepen Kuo have fully revealed the ugly face of this thoroughbred son and grandson of the bourgeoisie. What he said, "China does not have too much capitalism, but too little," "Today, capitalist exploitation is not only not a sin, but a merit," "The more exploitation, the greater the merit, the more glorious," "The working people do not oppose exploitation, but welcome it," "If there are more capitalists and more exploitation, then we will feel comfortable," is sheer nonsense, making our working class so angry that our lungs almost burst. This is a thoroughgoing agent of the bourgeoisie, a thoroughgoing lackey!

Our great leader Chairman Mao has repeatedly warned us: "We must be especially vigilant against personal careerists and conspirators like Khrushchev, and prevent such bad elements from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state at all levels."

This number one capitalist-roader within the Party is just such a personal careerist and conspirator like Khrushchev. We, the working class, are the masters of the state. We are most concerned about the future and destiny of our great motherland, and most concerned about ensuring that our country will never change color. We will never allow such careerists and conspirators to continue their deception, and we must resolutely pull this Chinese Khrushchev down from his horse, make him step aside, and thoroughly criticize and expose him!

We must expose how he, behind Chairman Mao's back, abused his power, gathered his followers, and plotted a nationwide capitalist restoration. We must thoroughly overthrow and criticize his followers in Shanghai.

We must thoroughly criticize and expose his reactionary line and his followers' heinous crimes committed during the Shanghai proletarian cultural revolution.

We must thoroughly expose his decades of reactionary words and deeds, expose his old tricks, and settle accounts with him. Especially, we must investigate and expose his and his followers' evil activities of serving the reactionary bourgeoisie in Shanghai and persecuting the Shanghai working class.

We must thoroughly criticize his anti-revolutionary, anti-class struggle, anti-proletarian seizure of power, anti-proletarian dictatorship, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought big poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation," and thoroughly eliminate its poison in Shanghai.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose."

We have recognized the false revolutionary, counter-revolutionary essence of the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line. We must more resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and engage in a head-on struggle with the Chinese Khrushchev. He incites strife and makes the masses fight each other, we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions to achieve great unity among the revolutionary masses. He wants to protect his counter-revolutionary revisionist comrades, practicing "striking a large group and protecting a small clique," we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, unite the majority, and strike down a small clique. He uses the bourgeois worldview, hypocritical philosophy of life, and decadent lifestyle to corrupt us, we must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, forever maintain the revolutionary style of being modest, prudent, unassuming, and striving hard.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage the war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage the war." We must launch a mass movement where everyone uses their brains, mouths, and pens to thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev.

We, the Shanghai working class, most admire our great leader Chairman Mao, and most love the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the great teacher of world revolution, and the reddest red sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism.

The number one agent of the bourgeoisie within the Party opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, so we must thoroughly criticize and expose him, making him never able to rise again!

    把中国的赫鲁晓夫彻底批臭
    上海市革命委员会革命群众组织代表
    上海工人造反总司令部负责人  王洪文
    戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》一文吹响了从政治上、思想上彻底打倒党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的战斗号角。
    戚本禹同志揭发的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的黑话，充分暴露了他那一副地地道道的资产阶级孝子贤孙的丑恶嘴脸。什么“中国不是资本主义太多了，而是资本主义太少了”，“今天资本主义的剥削不但没有罪恶，而且有功劳”，“剥削得越多，功劳越大，就越光荣”，“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削”，“如果资本家多了，剥削多了，那么，我们就感到舒服”，这真是混帐逻辑，把我们工人阶级的肺都气炸了。这是十足的资产阶级的代理人，十足的奴才相！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席谆谆告诫我们：“要特别警惕象赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导。”
    这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派就是象赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家。我们工人阶级是国家的主人，我们最关心伟大祖国的前途和命运，最关心保证我国永不变颜色。我们绝不允许这样的野心家和阴谋家继续招摇撞骗，要坚决把这个中国的赫鲁晓夫拉下马，让他靠边站，把他彻底批臭！
    我们要揭露他背着毛主席盗用职权，网罗党羽，搞全国范围的资本主义复辟的大阴谋，把他在上海的党羽，彻底斗倒，斗臭。
    我们要彻底批臭他提出并全力推行的资产阶级反动路线，彻底揭发他和他的党羽在上海无产阶级文化大革命中犯下的滔天罪行。
    我们要彻底揭露他几十年来的反动言行，揭他的老底，同他算总帐。特别要清算他和他的党羽为上海反动资产阶级服务，迫害上海工人阶级的罪恶活动。
    我们要彻底批判他的反对革命、反对阶级斗争、反对无产阶级夺权、反对无产阶级专政、反对毛泽东思想的大毒草《修养》，彻底清除它在上海的流毒。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”
    我们认清了中国的赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的假革命、反革命本质，我们要更加坚决地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，和中国的赫鲁晓夫展开针锋相对的斗争。他挑拨离间，大搞群众斗群众，我们就坚决按毛主席的指示实行无产阶级革命派的大联合。他要保护他那些反革命修正主义党徒，搞“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，我们就坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，团结大多数，打击一小撮。他用资产阶级的世界观、虚伪的处世哲学和腐朽的生活方式来腐蚀我们，我们就坚决照毛主席的教导，永远保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄不躁和艰苦奋斗的革命作风。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”我们要发动一场人人动脑、人人动口、人人动笔的搞臭中国的赫鲁晓夫的群众性批判运动。
    我们上海工人阶级最最崇拜我们伟大的领袖毛主席，最最热爱战无不胜的毛泽东思想。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是世界革命的伟大导师，是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义。
    党内头号资产阶级代理人反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，我们就要彻底批倒他，彻底搞臭他，让他永世不得翻身！
