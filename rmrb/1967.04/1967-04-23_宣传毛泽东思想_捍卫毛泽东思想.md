In the midst of the triumphant songs of the proletarian revolutionary forces in Beijing seizing power from the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, and in the decisive stage of launching a general offensive against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the *Beijing Daily*, as the organ of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, has officially been published!

The *Beijing Daily* is determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought, to stand firmly with the proletarian revolutionary forces, to resolutely overthrow the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists they support, and to thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Beijing Municipal Committee.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion, one must first do work in the ideological sphere. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this."

After the old *Beijing Daily* and the old *Beijing Evening News* were established, under the control of the counter-revolutionary revisionists Fan Jin and Zhou You, and directly under the control of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, they wholeheartedly implemented the entire counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, becoming their tools for subverting the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism. Especially during the three years of temporary economic difficulties in our country, the old *Beijing Daily* and the old *Beijing Evening News*, in close collaboration with domestic and foreign class enemies, stirred up storms and waves, unleashing all kinds of ghosts and demons, and publishing in large quantities the poisonous weeds such as *Yan Mountain Night Talk*, *Youth Ramblings*, *Theory of Ghosts Being Harmless*, and articles praising *The Dismissal of Hai Rui*, launching a frenzied attack on the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought, committing heinous crimes against the Party and the people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which sounded the death knell for the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee. However, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat; they will make their last struggles." Under the direct command and support of the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee used the old *Beijing Daily* to fiercely resist and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They strongly opposed the criticism of *The Dismissal of Hai Rui*, shielded the bourgeois rightists, suppressed the proletarian leftists, and attempted to divert the life-and-death political struggle onto the wrong path of "pure academic" discussion. After their series of tricks and schemes failed, they more carefully plotted a counter-revolutionary political swindle of "sacrificing the soldiers to save the generals," falsely criticizing while truly shielding, dreaming of saving their doomed fate.

"Ants climbing the locust tree boast of a great country, but how can a cicada shake a tree?"

On May 8, 1966, the *Liberation Army Daily* published the article *Open Fire on the Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist Black Line* by Comrade Gao Ju, and the *Guangming Daily* published the article *See Clearly, Distinguish True from False* by Comrade He Ming, which was like a thunderclap, exposing the class struggle cover of the old Beijing Municipal Committee and the old *Beijing Daily* editorial board. Following that, on May 10, the *Jiefang Daily* and the *Wenhui Daily* published Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article *On the Reactionary Nature of the "Three Family Village"*, and the *Red Flag* magazine published Comrade Chen Boda's article *On the Bourgeois Standpoint of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily"*. These articles quickly pushed the already begun serious class struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique's frenzied attack to a high tide, and the small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists of the old Beijing Municipal Committee immediately fell into the encirclement of the broad revolutionary masses of the city and the country.

However, the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, in order to save the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee and their own doomed fate, resisted the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and put forward a bourgeois reactionary line. The main leaders of the new Beijing Municipal Committee faithfully executed this bourgeois reactionary line. Under the leadership of the new Beijing Municipal Committee, the so-called "newly born" *Beijing Daily* again became a loyal tool for actively advocating and implementing this bourgeois reactionary line, shielding the small group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, suppressing and encircling the proletarian revolutionary forces, boosting the bourgeois morale and crushing the proletarian spirit, causing tremendous losses to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing and throughout the country.

The facts of class struggle have taught us: who holds the power of the newspaper is a big deal related to the fate of the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The proletarian revolutionary forces of Beijing, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, holding high the banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, have gone through one sharp and fierce struggle after another, repelled the bourgeois reactionary line's repeated counterattacks, and finally, on the day when the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" have been achieved, firmly seized the power of the *Beijing Daily*.

Chairman Mao said: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without stopping the old, there can be no flow of the new; without stopping, there can be no progress." For the old *Beijing Daily*, we must not adopt reformism, we must not merge the two; we must firmly hold high the great banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the old *Beijing Daily* that served the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and the bourgeois reactionary line politically, ideologically, and organizationally, and completely break with it, going in the opposite direction.

The old *Beijing Daily* vigorously opposed Mao Zedong Thought, extremely hated Mao Zedong Thought, maliciously attacked Mao Zedong Thought, and did everything possible to sabotage the great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The new *Beijing Daily* must go in the opposite direction, must forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to become a strong bastion for spreading Mao Zedong Thought. We must make the efforts to study Mao Zedong Thought, loyally implement Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically promote Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought as our most sacred and glorious fighting task. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism of our time, and is the guiding principle for all the work of the whole Party and the whole country. Chairman Mao's words are all truths, one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences. We have infinite love, infinite loyalty, infinite faith, and infinite admiration for Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we will vigorously promote and advocate for it; whatever goes against Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely resist, resolutely struggle against, and resolutely overthrow it! Even if our heads are cut off and our blood flows, Mao Zedong Thought must not be abandoned. We must strive to implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions: "We must let hundreds of millions of people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions, use Mao Zedong Thought to change the spiritual face of the whole society, and let this great spiritual force of Mao Zedong Thought become a great material force!"

The old *Beijing Daily* extremely hated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fiercely opposed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and tried to use the old ideology, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes to corrupt the masses, conquer hearts, and create public opinion to prepare for the counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism by the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee.

The new *Beijing Daily* must go in the opposite direction, must firmly stand in the forefront of the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and make the greatest efforts to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must firmly hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely counterattack all challenges from the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes in the ideological sphere, use the new ideology, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat to change the spiritual face of the whole society. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must follow Chairman Mao's instruction: "You must pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." We must resolutely join the proletarian revolutionary forces of the whole city to launch a comprehensive class struggle, launch a general offensive against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, thoroughly criticize their counter-revolutionary revisionist line and bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly criticize the typical work of revisionism *Cultivation*; launch a general offensive against the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee and the small group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in various units and departments, and strive to complete the great historical task of one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms.

The old *Beijing Daily* was a tool for creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, and it was an important anti-Party stronghold occupied by a small number of bourgeois "experts," "scholars," and "authorities."

The new *Beijing Daily* must go in the opposite direction, must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions on the whole Party running newspapers and the whole people running newspapers. Chairman Mao said: "Our newspapers must also be run by everyone, run by the masses of the people, run by the whole Party, and cannot be run by a few people behind closed doors." We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, rely on the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and rely on the proletarian revolutionary forces of the whole city to run the newspaper, and strive to carry forward the lively, distinct, sharp, bold, and unhesitant fighting style.

Let the great, invincible, brilliant, and boundless Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy the position of the *Beijing Daily*! (April 22)

### 宣传毛泽东思想　捍卫毛泽东思想

    宣传毛泽东思想　捍卫毛泽东思想
    在全市无产阶级革命派向旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团夺权斗争的凯歌声中，在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发起总攻击的决战阶段，《北京日报》作为北京市革命委员会机关报正式出刊了！
      《北京日报》决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，大力宣传毛泽东思想，坚定地同无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，坚决打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及他们所支持的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，彻底揭露、彻底批判旧北京市委的反革命修正主义路线。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”
    旧《北京日报》、旧《北京晚报》创刊后，在反革命修正主义分子范瑾、周游把持下，在旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团直接控制下，死心踏地地贯彻执行了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的一整套反革命修正主义路线，成了他们颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的工具。尤其是在我国三年暂时经济困难时期，旧《北京日报》、旧《北京晚报》同国内外阶级敌人紧密配合，呼风唤雨，推涛作浪，放手让一切牛鬼蛇神出笼，大登特登《燕山夜话》、《青春漫语》、《有鬼无害论》和吹捧《海瑞罢官》的文章等大批毒草，向党向社会主义向毛泽东思想发动猖狂进攻，对党对人民犯下了滔天罪行。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，敲响了旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的丧钟。但是，正如毛主席指出的那样：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的直接指挥和支持下，利用旧《北京日报》，疯狂地对抗和破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们极力抵制对《海瑞罢官》的批判，包庇资产阶级右派，打击无产阶级左派，妄图把一场你死我活的政治斗争引上“纯学术”讨论的邪路。当他们耍弄的一系列阴谋诡计破产以后，更精心策划了一个“舍车马、保将帅”的假批判、真包庇的反革命政治大骗局，梦想挽救他们行将灭亡的命运。
    “蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。”
    一九六六年五月八日，《解放军报》发表高炬同志《向反党反社会主义的黑线开火》、《光明日报》发表何明同志《擦亮眼睛，辨别真假》的文章，有如一声霹雳，揭开了旧北京市委、旧《北京日报》社的阶级斗争盖子；接着，五月十日《解放日报》、《文汇报》发表的姚文元同志《评“三家村”——〈燕山夜话〉〈三家村札记〉的反动本质》的文章，以及《红旗》杂志发表的戚本禹同志《评〈前线〉〈北京日报〉的资产阶级立场》的文章，把已经开始的这一场反击反革命修正主义集团猖狂进攻的严重的阶级斗争，迅速地推向了高潮，旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子立即陷入全市全国广大革命群众的重重包围之中。
    但是，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了挽救旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团和他们自己彻底垮台的命运，抗拒无产阶级文化大革命，提出了一条资产阶级反动路线。北京新市委的主要负责人忠实地执行了这条资产阶级反动路线。在北京新市委领导下的所谓“新生”的《北京日报》，又成了积极鼓吹和贯彻执行这条资产阶级反动路线的忠实工具，包庇党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，打击、围剿无产阶级革命派，长资产阶级威风，灭无产阶级志气，给北京市和全国无产阶级文化大革命造成了巨大的损失。
    阶级斗争的事实教育了我们：报纸大权掌握在什么人手里，这是关系到无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政命运的大事。
    无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想的北京市无产阶级革命派，高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的旗帜，经历了一场又一场尖锐、激烈的斗争，打退了资产阶级反动路线一次又一次的反扑，终于在实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”的今天，牢牢地掌握了《北京日报》的大权。
    毛主席说：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。对于旧《北京日报》，我们决不能采取改良主义，决不能搞“合二而一”；我们必须高举无产阶级的革命的批判大旗，从政治上、思想上、组织上彻底批判为反革命修正主义路线和资产阶级反动路线服务的旧《北京日报》，同它一刀两断，彻底决裂，反其道而行之。
    旧《北京日报》竭力反对毛泽东思想，极端仇视毛泽东思想，恶毒攻击毛泽东思想，千方百计地破坏活学活用毛主席著作的伟大群众运动。
    新《北京日报》必须反其道而行之，必须永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力成为传播毛泽东思想的坚强阵地。我们一定要把努力学习毛泽东思想，忠实贯彻毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想作为自己最崇高、最光荣的战斗任务。毛泽东思想是当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是全党全国一切工作的指导方针。毛主席的话，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。我们对毛泽东思想，无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，无限崇拜。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，我们就大力宣传，大力提倡，为它叫好；凡是违反毛泽东思想的，我们就坚决抵制，坚决斗争，坚决打倒！头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢。我们一定努力执行林副主席的指示：“我们要让亿万人民掌握毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，用毛泽东思想来改变整个社会的精神面貌，让毛泽东思想这个伟大的精神力量，变成伟大的物质力量！”
    旧《北京日报》极端仇视无产阶级文化大革命，疯狂反对无产阶级文化大革命，力图用剥削阶级的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯，来腐蚀群众，征服人心，为党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团阴谋复辟资本主义制造舆论准备。
    新《北京日报》必须反其道而行之，必须坚定地站在无产阶级文化大革命斗争的最前列，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为巩固无产阶级专政，作最大的努力。我们一定要努力高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，迎头痛击资产阶级和其它剥削阶级在意识形态领域里的一切挑战，用无产阶级自己的新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯，来改变整个社会的精神面貌。在当前无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们一定遵循毛主席的“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，坚决同全市无产阶级革命派一道，开展全面的阶级斗争，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开总攻击，彻底批判他们推行的反革命修正主义路线和资产阶级反动路线，彻底批判典型的修正主义代表作《修养》；向旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团和各单位、各部门党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开总攻击，为完成一斗二批三改的伟大历史任务而斗争。
    旧《北京日报》是为资本主义复辟制造舆论的工具，它是极少数资产阶级的“专家”、“学者”、“权威”霸占的一个重要的反党阵地。
    新《北京日报》必须反其道而行之，必须坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于全党办报和全体人民群众办报的指示。毛主席说：“我们的报纸也要靠大家来办，靠全体人民群众来办，靠全党来办，而不能只靠少数人关起门来办。”我们一定坚决听毛主席的话，依靠广大工农兵群众，依靠全市无产阶级革命派办报，努力发扬生动、鲜明、尖锐、泼辣、毫不吞吞吐吐的战斗风格。
    让伟大的、战无不胜的、光芒万丈的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想，永远占领《北京日报》这个阵地！　（四月二十二日）
