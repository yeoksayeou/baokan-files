	Italian "Communist" magazine issues 1-2 of 1967 published an article condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's intensifying collusion with American imperialism to form a counter-revolutionary alliance. The article points out that in recent times, the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with American imperialism has further developed. "The United States has already relaxed its restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union and resumed negotiations on opening a direct route. Both sides have signed broader agreements on mutual assistance and cooperation in the fields of culture, science, and technology. At the recent United Nations meeting, the Soviet Union and the United States drafted a 'peaceful' treaty on the use of outer space. In recent days, President Johnson has proposed that the Soviet Union abandon the establishment of an anti-missile network... This is a significant step (for the Soviet Union and the United States) in their recent comprehensive cooperation to jointly rule the world."

	The article states: "These facts prove that the Soviet Union and the United States have gradually formed a counter-revolutionary alliance." "What we see is the global strategy of American imperialism and the Soviet Union to rule the world. The basic goal of this global strategy at present is: to achieve 'peace' in Vietnam, to build a encirclement around China, so as to invade China in the next step, thereby suppressing the liberation struggles of the peoples of various countries."

	The article exposes the Soviet revisionist leadership's efforts to collude with American imperialism on the Vietnamese issue, betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people. The article states: The Soviet Union has been vigorously supporting U Thant in recent times and has been exerting pressure on North Vietnam to accept the conditions for starting negotiations proposed by the United States. The article points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership not only does not oppose the U.S. aggression against Vietnam but actively collaborates with the United States, openly blackmailing Vietnam.

	The article further points out that in order to implement the line of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world, the Soviet revisionist leadership must attack the correct stance of the Communist Party of China and all Communist Parties that support the stance of the Communist Party of China. The article emphasizes that the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with American imperialism to oppose the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people and the peoples of the world will in no way stop the victory of socialism in China and will not stop the struggles of the peoples of various countries against American imperialism.

	Another article points out that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has shattered the delusions of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists of restoring capitalism in China. They are now plotting new anti-China conspiracies. The article points out that if the aggressors dare to launch a war against China, it will only hasten their doom and promote the development and victory of the world proletarian revolution.

    意《共产主义者》谴责苏美加紧勾结镇压各国人民斗争
    苏美反革命联盟挡不住人民的反美怒潮
    中国文化大革命使美帝苏修希望中国复辟资本主义的梦想破灭了
    新华社六日讯　罗马消息：意大利《共产主义者》杂志一至二月合刊号发表文章，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团加紧同美帝国主义进行勾结，组织反革命联盟。文章指出，最近一个时期，苏联修正主义领导集团同美帝国主义的勾结又有了进一步的发展。“美国早已放松了对苏联贸易的限制，恢复了有关开辟一条直达航线的谈判。双方就文化、科学和技术方面相互援助和合作缔结了更广泛的协定。在最近一次的联合国会议上，苏美起草了‘和平’利用外层空间条约。这些天来，约翰逊总统又建议苏联放弃建立反导弹网……这是（美苏）最近在为共同统治世界进行全面合作方面迈出的重要一步。”
    文章说：“这些事实证明，苏美已逐步结成反革命联盟。”“我们所看到的正是美帝国主义和苏联统治世界的全球战略，这个全球战略在当前的基本目标是：在越南实现美国的‘和平’，在中国周围建立包围圈，以便下一步侵略中国，从而镇压各国人民的解放斗争。”
    文章揭露苏修领导集团在越南问题上竭力同美帝国主义串通一气，出卖越南人民的利益。文章说：苏联竭力利用越南问题来为它同美帝国主义合作的政策服务。“苏联在最近一个时期大力支持吴丹，并对越南北方施加压力，要越南接受美国提出的开始谈判的条件。”文章指出，苏修领导集团不仅不去反对美国对越南的侵略，反而竭力迎合美国，对越南进行公开的讹诈。
    文章接着指出，苏联修正主义领导集团为了推行苏美合作主宰世界的路线，必然要对中国共产党的正确立场和所有支持中国共产党立场的共产党进行攻击。文章强调指出，苏联修正主义领导集团勾结美帝国主义，反对中国和世界各国人民革命斗争的阴谋活动，丝毫也阻止不了社会主义在中国的胜利，阻止不了各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    另一篇文章中指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，使美帝和苏修对在中国复辟资本主义的痴心妄想破灭了。它们正在策划新的反华阴谋。文章指出，如果侵略者胆敢发动对中国的战争，那就只会加速它们的灭亡，并且促成全世界无产阶级革命的发展和胜利。
