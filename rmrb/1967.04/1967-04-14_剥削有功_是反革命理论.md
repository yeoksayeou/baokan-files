Title: "Exploitation Has Merit" is a Counter-Revolutionary Theory

The article “Patriotism or Treachery?” exposes the fallacy of the top capitalist-roaders within the Party advocating the idea that “exploitation is guiltless.” When I saw this fallacy, I was so angry that my hands trembled and my lungs almost burst!

Our dearest and most beloved Chairman Mao says: “The landlord class’s ruthless economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants forced them to rise up repeatedly to resist the landlord class’s rule. … In Chinese feudal society, only the peasants’ class struggle, peasant uprisings, and peasant wars were the true driving force of historical development.” Chairman Mao is our poor and lower-middle peasants’ most beloved and closest kin. It is he who led us poor and lower-middle peasants to overthrow the rule of the landlords and the bourgeoisie; it is he who led us poor and lower-middle peasants out of the narrow path of individual farming and onto the broad road of socialism. However, the top capitalist-roader within the Party pretends to stand on Chairman Mao’s side on the surface, but secretly opposes Chairman Mao; pretends to sit on the same bench with us poor and lower-middle peasants, but in reality, breathes the same air as the landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists. He blathers on about “exploitation is guiltless,” “exploitation has merit,” “hiring labor is not exploitation,” and “hiring labor to farm is legal and beneficial to the masses.” This is all nonsense.

“Exploitation is guiltless” is purely the talk of the exploiting class. We poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will never believe such nonsense. There is an old saying in our village: “Poor people farming three mu, their shoulders rot away; landlords farming a hundred mu, they lie in bed all day.” The evil of class exploitation is like the wind in the hair and the water in the sea, countless and endless.

Before liberation, we poor and lower-middle peasants farmed one mu of rented land for a landlord, and for every ten dou of grain harvested, we had to give five dou as rent; if we farmed one mu of “contract land” for a landlord, for every twenty dou of grain harvested, we only received two dou as wages. Is this not “exploitation is guiltless”?

We poor and lower-middle peasants helped the landlords with busy seasons, did odd jobs, and wore out our shoulders and feet. For a day’s work, we could barely earn a sheng of grain, and in the end, we farmed the landlord’s fields well but let our own fields go to waste. We poor and lower-middle peasants worked as long-term laborers for the landlords, doing the work of oxen and horses, eating the food of pigs and dogs, and for a whole year, our sweat flowed into the landlord’s fields, and our tears fell in our own homes. Is this not “hiring labor to farm is not exploitation and is beneficial to the masses”?

In the old society, what fell on the heads of the poor were the “three knives” (rent, debt, and high interest), and what lay before them were the “three roads” (starvation, prison, and the noose). Are the heinous crimes of the exploitative system still not enough?

Take me, for example. I have seen with my own eyes that the crime of exploitation is heavier than mountains and deeper than the sea. I am the daughter of a poor peasant. Under the exploitative system of the old society, my stepfather and sister were both tortured to death. Today, I am seriously ill and half-paralyzed. Because I was born in the new society and nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, with the care of the Party and my class brothers, not only do I live well but I can also serve the people. If I had been born in the old society under the exploitative system, not just one Stenyu Ying, but ten thousand Stenyu Yings would have long since ceased to exist. The exploitative system is a system that eats people, and the exploiting class is our poor and lower-middle peasants’ sworn enemy. We poor and lower-middle peasants hate exploitation to the core and have a blood debt with the exploiting class. We say, exploitation is not only guilty but deserves to die a thousand deaths and is heinously evil!

Why does the top capitalist-roader within the Party want to reverse black and white, turning the evil of exploitation into “guiltless” and “legal”? In short, it is to try to make us poor and lower-middle peasants retrace our steps and suffer again. Chairman Mao teaches us: “In our country, although the socialist transformation, in terms of ownership, has basically been completed, and the large-scale, stormy class struggles of the revolutionary period have basically ended, the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador class still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense. The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not yet been truly resolved.” The top capitalist-roader within the Party is the bourgeoisie’s agent within the Party. He loves capitalism and welcomes exploitation; he hates socialism and opposes Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants will forever follow Chairman Mao and defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death. Mao Zedong Thought is a telescope, seeing clearly for thousands of miles; Mao Zedong Thought is a microscope, seeing through all harmful elements; Mao Zedong Thought is a mirror that reveals demons, and all demons and ghosts show their true forms. No matter what tricks the Khrushchev-like figures hiding among us play, we can expose them and root them out.

Only by hating the enemy deeply can we love the people profoundly. Although my body is not well, I will definitely, together with the broad masses of revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the fallacy of “exploitation is guiltless,” and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### “剥削有功”是反革命理论

    “剥削有功”是反革命理论
    学习毛主席著作积极分子江苏太仓沙溪公社洪泾大队  沈玉英
    《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》这篇文章，揭出了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹“剥削无罪”的谬论。我看到这种谬论，气得手发抖，肺几乎要炸了！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席说：“地主阶级对于农民的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，迫使农民多次地举行起义，以反抗地主阶级的统治。……在中国封建社会里，只有这种农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”毛主席是我们贫下中农最亲最亲的亲人。是他老人家领导我们贫下中农，推翻了地主、资产阶级的统治；是他老人家领导我们贫下中农离开小农经济的独木桥，走上社会主义的阳关道。可是，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，表面上装作站在毛主席一边，暗地里却在跟毛主席唱对台戏；表面上装作跟我们贫下中农坐一条板凳，骨子里却跟地主富农资本家一鼻孔出气。他胡说什么“剥削无罪”，“剥削有功”，“雇人劳动不叫剥削”，“雇工种地是合法的，对群众也有好处”。这真是鬼话连篇。
    “剥削无罪”完全是剥削阶级的论调。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农，决不会相信这种鬼话。我们村上有句老话：“穷人种田三亩，烂了肩膀；地主占田百亩，朝床上躺。”阶级剥削的罪恶，就好象是风里头发、海里的水，数不清，说不完。
    解放前，我们贫下中农种地主一亩租田，收一担米要五斗租；替地主种一亩“包田”，收两担米只给两斗米工钱。这难道是“剥削无罪”吗？
    我们贫下中农帮地主做忙月，打短工，磨穿肩胛，踏肿脚板。一个忙工挣不到一升米，到头来，种好了地主田，荒了自己田。我们贫下中农帮地主当长工，更是做的牛马活，吃的猪狗食，一年到头汗水淌到地主田里，眼泪落在自己家里。这难道是“雇工种地不算剥削，对群众也有好处”吗？
    在旧社会，落在穷人头上的是“三把刀”（租米、债米、高利息），摆在穷人面前的是三条路（挨饿、坐牢、一条绳）。剥削制度的这些滔天罪行，难道还算少吗？
    拿我来说，我就亲眼看到剥削的罪比山还重，比海还深。我是一个贫农的女儿。在旧社会的剥削制度下，我的前父和姐姐都被折磨得病死。今天我得了重病，半身瘫痪。因为是长在新社会，靠毛泽东思想的哺育，有党和阶级兄弟的关怀，我不但活得很好，而且还能为人民服务。要是长在旧社会的剥削制度下，别说一个沈玉英，一千一万个沈玉英也早已不在世上了。剥削制度是吃人的制度，剥削阶级是我们贫下中农的死对头。我们贫下中农恨透了剥削，对剥削阶级有血海深仇。我们说，剥削不但有罪，而且是罪该万死，罪恶滔天！
    为啥党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，要颠倒黑白，把万恶的剥削说成“无罪”、“合法”的呢？说穿了，就是妄想叫我们贫下中农走回头路，吃二遍苦。毛主席教导我们：“在我国，虽然社会主义改造，在所有制方面说来，已经基本完成，革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争已经基本结束，但是，被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，就是资产阶级在党内的代理人。他爱的是资本主义，欢迎的是剥削；恨的是社会主义，反对的是毛泽东思想。
    毛泽东思想是我们贫下中农的命根子，我们贫下中农永远跟着毛主席走，誓死捍卫毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是望远镜，千里万里看得清；毛泽东思想是显微镜，看穿一切害人精；毛泽东思想是照妖镜，一切妖魔鬼怪现原形。不管躲藏在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫式的人物耍什么花招，我们都能识破他，揪出他。
    对敌人恨得透，对人民才能爱得深。我虽然身体不好，也一定要和广大革命的贫下中农一起，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判“剥削无罪”的谬论，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
