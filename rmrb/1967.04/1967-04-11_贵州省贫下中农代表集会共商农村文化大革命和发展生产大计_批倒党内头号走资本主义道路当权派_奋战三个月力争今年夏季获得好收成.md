Representatives of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants in Guizhou Province Gather to Discuss the Cultural Revolution in Rural Areas and Plans for Agricultural Development
Overthrow the Top Capitalist-Roader in the Party
Strive for Three Months to Achieve a Good Harvest This Summer

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou, April 9th: The Representatives' Meeting of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants in Guizhou Province was held in Guiyang from April 2nd to 4th, in a great situation where the proletarian cultural revolution in Guizhou Province has achieved decisive victory and the people of the entire province have launched a new high tide of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." Over 5,000 representatives from more than 4,200 people's communes across the province gathered to discuss the cultural revolution in rural areas and plans for agricultural development. The representatives angrily exposed and criticized the crimes of the top capitalist-roader in the party who attempted to restore capitalism. They exchanged experiences in seizing the revolution and promoting production and issued a call to all poor and lower-middle peasants in the province to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

	This meeting was a grand gathering of great unity and solidarity among the poor and lower-middle peasants of all nationalities in the province, a meeting to express their determination to Chairman Mao, the red sun in their hearts, and to achieve double victories in revolution and production, and a mobilization meeting to launch a mass movement to criticize the top capitalist-roader in the party in the rural areas of Guizhou.

	Representatives from various parts of Guizhou expressed their heartfelt wishes for Chairman Mao, the red sun in their hearts, to live forever!

	In the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants of all nationalities in Guizhou, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have been fighting against a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and a small handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. They have smashed the wanton attacks of counter-revolutionary economism and repelled the counter-revolutionary tide of a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who persist in their reactionary stance, attempting to sabotage the collective economy and overthrow the achievements of the "Four Cleanups." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have thoroughly criticized the "four olds" of the exploiting classes and established the "four news" of the proletariat. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, they have established revolutionary production leadership teams and launched a vigorous spring plowing production high tide. They have never been as spirited, enthusiastic, and full of vigor as they are now.

	The representatives believe that in this great situation, it is of great importance to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end and not to stop halfway. The representatives of all nationalities of poor and lower-middle peasants at this meeting, through studying Chairman Mao's works and the relevant policies of the Party Central Committee, and in light of the current situation in their localities, saw a great situation while also being soberly aware that a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the ghosts and snakes in society are still continuing their conspiracies. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the revolution through to the end.

	During the meeting, the representatives carefully studied the important article "Patriotism or Treason?" published in the Red Flag magazine. With great indignation, they denounced the top capitalist-roader in the party, exposing and criticizing his crimes of attacking our great leader Chairman Mao, opposing collectivization, advocating the "four freedoms," promoting the "three selfs and one package," "three harmonies and one less," and in the socialist education movement, proposing and implementing a rightist opportunist line disguised as "leftist." The representatives attending the meeting deeply realized that they must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "It is best to pursue the fleeing enemy, do not seek fame like King Xiang Yu," and press on. They must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, resolutely overthrow the top capitalist-roader in the party, and concentrate their efforts to strike at a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed, and swear to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

	The representatives pointed out unanimously in their discussions that a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Guizhou Provincial Party Committee had long faithfully executed the reactionary bourgeois line of the top capitalist-roader in the party. Therefore, this reactionary bourgeois line has deeply poisoned and greatly harmed Guizhou Province. The representatives expressed their determination to overthrow and expose the top capitalist-roader in the party, to cleanse the poison of the reactionary bourgeois line represented by him in all aspects, to block the road to capitalist restoration, and to ensure that our socialist state will never change color for ten thousand generations.

	The representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants discussed the issue of correctly handling the relationship between revolution and production.

	The meeting called on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," to play the role of the main force, to unite the broad masses, to form a vast revolutionary army, to work during the day and make revolution at night, to fight a good battle in spring plowing production, and to achieve a great harvest in agriculture this year. The representatives attending the meeting also proposed to rely on the masses, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," to work hard and smart, to strive for three months, and to strive for a good summer harvest this year.

	The meeting believed that to do a good job in the cultural revolution and spring plowing production, the most fundamental thing is to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to let Mao Zedong Thought guide everything. To truly make studying and applying Chairman Mao's works higher than everything, greater than everything, heavier than everything, and earlier than everything. Let the dazzling Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, turn Guizhou's rural areas into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought, and turn the entire province into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The meeting finally passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao in thunderous applause and adopted the "Resolution of the Representatives' Meeting of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants in Guizhou Province."

    贵州省贫下中农代表集会共商农村文化大革命和发展生产大计
    批倒党内头号走资本主义道路当权派
    奋战三个月力争今年夏季获得好收成
    据新华社贵阳九日电  贵州省贫下中农代表会议在贵州省无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利和全省人民掀起抓革命、促生产新高潮的大好形势下，于四月二日到四日在贵阳隆重举行。来自全省四千二百多个人民公社的五千多名各民族贫下中农代表，聚集在一起，共商农村文化大革命和发展农业生产的大计。代表们愤怒地揭发批判了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派妄图复辟资本主义的罪行。他们交流了抓革命、促生产的经验，向全省贫下中农发出了夺取革命和生产双胜利的号召。
    这次大会是全省各民族贫下中农大联合、大团结、大会师的大会，是向我们各族人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席表决心，誓夺革命和生产双胜利的大会，是在贵州农村掀起对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派大批判的群众运动的动员大会。
    来自贵州各地的贫下中农代表在大会发言中，千遍万遍地祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，贵州各民族贫下中农，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子的反，粉碎了反革命经济主义的猖狂进攻，打退了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子妄图破坏集体经济、推翻“四清”成果的反革命逆流。广大贫下中农大破剥削阶级的
  “四旧”，大立无产阶级的
  “四新”。他们在人民解放军的帮助下，建立了革命的生产领导班子，掀起了轰轰烈烈的春耕生产高潮。他们从来也没有象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。
    代表们认为，在这个大好形势面前，十分重要的问题是要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不能半途而废。各民族贫下中农代表在这次会上，通过学习毛主席著作和党中央有关方针政策，对照本地当前实际情况，既看到一派大好形势，也清醒地看到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，还在继续进行阴谋活动。广大贫下中农必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，将革命进行到底。
    会议期间，代表们认真学习了《红旗》杂志发表的重要文章《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》他们怀着无比的愤怒，声讨党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，揭发和批判了这个中国的赫鲁晓夫攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席，反对合作化，提倡“四大自由”，鼓吹“三自一包”、“三和一少”，以及在社会主义教育运动中提出和推行形“左”实右的机会主义路线等罪行。参加大会的代表深刻地认识到，必须遵循毛主席“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”的教导，乘胜前进。要紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，坚决打倒党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。要集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    代表们在讨论中一致指出，原贵州省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，长期忠实执行党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的资产阶级反动路线，因此，这条资产阶级反动路线在贵州省流毒很深，为害极大。代表们表示，决心把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派批倒斗臭，肃清以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线在各方面的流毒，堵死资本主义复辟的道路，保证我们的社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。
    贫下中农代表们讨论了进一步正确处理革命和生产的关系问题。
    会议号召广大贫下中农坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，发挥主力军的作用，团结广大群众，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，白天搞生产，晚上闹革命，打好春耕生产这一仗，夺取今年农业大丰收。到会代表还提出，要依靠群众，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，苦干巧干，奋战四、五、六三个月，力争今年有一个好的夏收。
    会议认为，搞好文化大革命和春耕生产，最根本的一条，就是要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。真正做到活学活用毛主席著作高于一切，大于一切，重于一切，先于一切。让光芒万丈的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，把贵州农村办成毛泽东思想的大学校，把全省办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    大会最后在春雷般的掌声中通过了给毛主席的致敬电，并通过了《贵州省贫下中农代表会议决议》。
