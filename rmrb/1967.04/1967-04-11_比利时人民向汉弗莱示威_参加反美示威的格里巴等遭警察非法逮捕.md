Belgian people held mass demonstrations on the 8th and 9th to strongly protest against the activities of U.S. Vice President Humphrey in Belgium. The Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, Griba, and some leaders of progressive youth organizations were illegally arrested by the police while participating in the demonstration on the 8th.

After Humphrey arrived in Brussels on the 8th, several hundred people immediately held a protest demonstration in the city center. They carried banners and shouted slogans such as "Yankees, get out of Belgium!" and "Yankees, get out of Vietnam!" Many people joined the march.

Griba, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, and leaders of Belgian progressive youth organizations also participated in the march.

The Belgian authorities dispatched thousands of police to escort Humphrey from the airport to the city, and they arrested many demonstrators. Griba and many demonstrators were illegally arrested by the police.

On the 9th, when Humphrey arrived at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Belgium, about a hundred demonstrators threw rotten eggs, spoiled fruit, and paint at Humphrey's motorcade. Several rotten eggs hit Humphrey's car. The demonstrators also burned an American flag and shouted slogans such as "Johnson and Humphrey are murderers!" "Yankees, go back!" and "Long live the Vietnamese people!"
