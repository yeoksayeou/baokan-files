Recently, we have seen news in the newspapers about the Indian people's struggle against tyranny and for survival. We, the Chinese working class, are deeply concerned. We firmly support the Indian people's just struggle.

India is our neighboring country, a large nation with a population of five hundred million, rich in resources, with crops harvested three times a year. However, the Indian people have long been living in misery. In recent years, the food shortage has been particularly severe. Last year, in many states, the ration of rice per person per day was less than half a jin. Food prices have also skyrocketed, increasing by more than ninety percent from June to August last year. The Indian reactionary ruling class exploits the laboring people to the bone, with endless taxes and levies. The broad masses of the Indian people are struggling on the brink of starvation, and the entire country is in chaos.

The reason why the Indian people suffer so much is fundamentally because they are burdened by three mountains: imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Although India declared independence long ago, imperialist forces still control the country. The political power in India has always been in the hands of the Congress Party, which represents imperialism and domestic reactionary forces. The Indian people must rise up to rebel against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and overthrow these three mountains to achieve true independence and liberation.

The Indian people have been fighting against tyranny and for survival. Facing the widespread resistance of the people, the Indian reactionary rulers are terrified and have adopted extremely brutal suppression methods. In just the past year, more than eighty thousand people have been arrested by Indian military and police, and countless others have been beaten to death or injured. However, as Chairman Mao teaches us: "The various reactionaries... the more they oppress the revolutionary people, the more they will ultimately promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." The more the reactionaries oppress, the stronger the people's resistance. The Indian people's struggle fully proves this truth.

In recent years, the Indian people have launched broader and more intense struggles. They go on strike, demonstrate, attack Congress Party offices, ministerial residences, and police stations. They often fight against reactionary military and police with bare hands or with bricks, arrows, and spears. In some rural areas, farmers open granaries to distribute grain, refuse to pay rent, beat up landlords and officials, and oppose the government's seizure of land to establish monopolistic capitalist farms. Especially in the Mizoram region of Assam, the Mizo tribe has been waging armed struggle since last February and is steadily achieving victories. Even with the Indian government dispatching large numbers of military and police for suppression, they still control about seven hundred scattered villages and some military outposts. The Indian people's revolutionary spirit of rebellion is indomitable by any reactionary force.

The Chinese people also experienced the same hardships as today's Indian people before liberation, so we deeply understand the plight of the Indian people today. In the past, under the oppression of the three mountains, we workers toiled all year round without warmth and food, living a life worse than cattle. Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the Chinese people waged a long-term revolutionary struggle and finally overthrew the rule of American imperialism and its running dogs in China, becoming the masters of the state. Currently, Chairman Mao is leading us in an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, uprooting revisionism, and preventing capitalist restoration, ensuring that our socialist state will never change color and guaranteeing that our laboring people will never again live in the dark days before liberation. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is also a great support for the revolutionary struggles of the Indian people and the people of the world.

The Indian people have a long history of struggle and a glorious revolutionary tradition. No matter what difficulties and twists they encounter on their forward path, they will surely continue to achieve victories and ultimately overthrow the three mountains weighing on their heads. The future of the Indian people is bright, and final victory will surely belong to the Indian people!

    压迫愈深  反抗愈大
    最近在报纸上看到印度人民反暴政、争生存斗争的消息，我们中国工人阶级十分关切。我们坚决地支持印度人民的正义斗争。
    印度是我们的邻邦，是一个有五亿人口的大国，物产丰富，农作物一年三熟。但是，印度人民却长年处在水深火热之中。近年来，粮荒特别严重。去年，在许多邦，大米的配给量每人每天不到半市两。粮食价格也在猛涨，去年六月到八月，就上涨百分之九十以上。印度反动统治阶级对劳动人民敲骨吸髓，苛捐杂税不断增加。印度广大人民在饥饿线上挣扎，整个国家民不聊生。
    印度人民为什么这样多灾多难，从根儿上讲就是因为帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山压在他们的头上。印度虽然早就宣布独立了，但是帝国主义势力仍然控制着这个国家。印度的政权一直掌握在代表帝国主义和国内反动势力的国大党的手里。印度人民只有起来造帝国主义的反，造封建主义的反，造官僚资本主义的反，推翻这三座大山，才能得到真正的独立和解放。
    印度人民为了反暴政、争生存一直进行着斗争。印度的反动统治者面对广大人民的反抗，怕得要死，于是采用了极其残暴的镇压手段。仅仅最近一年以来，被印度军警逮捕的群众就有八万多人，被打死打伤的不计其数。但是，正如毛主席教导我们的：“各国反动派……对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”反动派压迫得愈厉害，人民的反抗就愈大。印度人民的斗争完全证实了这一真理。
    近年来，印度人民展开了更广泛更剧烈的斗争。他们举行罢工、示威，袭击国大党和政府办事处、部长住宅和警察局。他们常常赤手空拳或者用砖石、弓箭、梭镖同反动军警搏斗。在一些农村，农民开仓分粮，抗缴租税，痛打地主、官吏，反对政府征收土地给垄断资本家办农场。特别是阿萨姆邦的米佐部族，从去年二月以来，一直坚持武装斗争，正在节节取得胜利。在印度政府出动大批军警进行镇压的情况下，他们还是控制了大约七百个分散的村庄和一些军事据点。印度人民的这种革命造反精神是任何反动力量都压不倒的。
    我们中国人民在解放前也经历过同今天印度人民一样的苦难，所以，我们深深懂得印度人民今日的处境。过去在三座大山的压迫下，我们工人终年劳动，不得温饱，过着牛马不如的生活。中国人民在我们伟大领袖毛主席和共产党的领导下，进行了长期的革命斗争，终于推翻了美帝国主义及其走狗在中国的统治，当了国家的主人。目前，毛主席领导我们进行史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，挖修正主义的根子，防止资本主义复辟，使我们的社会主义江山永不变色，保证我们劳动人民永远不再过解放前那样暗无天日的生活。中国无产阶级文化大革命，也是对印度人民和世界人民的革命斗争的极大支持。
    印度人民有着悠久的斗争历史，有着光荣的革命传统。不管印度人民在前进的道路上会遇到什么样的困难和曲折，他们一定能够不断地取得胜利，最后推翻压在自己头上的三座大山。印度人民的前途是无限光明的，最后胜利一定是属于印度人民的！
