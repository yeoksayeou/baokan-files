The editorial article in the fifth issue of "Red Flag" magazine and Comrade Chen Boda's article "Patriotism or Treachery?" have sounded the new charge for the proletarian cultural revolution, marking the struggle for power in the proletarian cultural revolution entering a new, deeper stage. The "January Revolution" storm in Shanghai initially focused on seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. This power struggle has swept across the nation. Currently, the focus of the struggle is on the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, conducting a thorough criticism and settlement in political thought. Without thoroughly criticizing and settling the political thought of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, eliminating his influence, and eradicating his poison, and occupying all positions in the political thought domain with Mao Zedong Thought, we cannot achieve the final victory in the power struggle, the organizational seizure of power cannot be consolidated, and the root of revisionism cannot be uprooted, potentially leading to a resurgence. These two articles from "Red Flag" magazine, at this critical moment, have once again pointed out the general direction of our struggle, marking a great strategic step. This is a matter of paramount importance concerning whether we follow the socialist path or the capitalist path, whether we uphold Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought or capitalism and revisionism; it is a matter of paramount importance concerning the fate of our country and even the world; it is a matter of paramount importance concerning whether we carry the cultural revolution through to the end or abandon it halfway; it is a matter of long-term planning for a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand years.

This number one capitalist-roader within the Party is the root of the bourgeois reactionary line in the long-term struggle between the two lines within the Party, the root of the bourgeois reactionary line in the struggle between the two lines in this cultural revolution, the root of the rampant counter-revolutionary economism in various places in the previous period, and also the root of the recent capitalist restoration countercurrent from top to bottom. To capture the ringleader, one must first capture the king; to eradicate weeds, one must pull out the roots. The criticism of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party is to uproot the old roots of revisionism in our country.

The great practice of the Chinese revolution has proven that this number one capitalist-roader within the Party has never been a Marxist, has never been a revolutionary of the proletariat. His theories, his policies, and his lines have always been either right or "left" in form but right in essence. At best, he is a bourgeois or petty-bourgeois revolutionary. His influence, spread throughout the Party and the nation, even worldwide, in his "Studies in Ideology," has not a hint of Marxism-Leninism or Mao Zedong Thought, not a hint of proletarian spirit. In reality, it is the ancestor of feudal society's political, ideological, and moral cultivation, Confucius and Mencius. Yet, he has it reprinted again and again, urging cadres, party members, and the masses to treat this rubbish as a "classic," preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, it must be thoroughly criticized.

The current struggle to criticize the number one capitalist-roader within the Party is a decisive battle in the cultural revolution. All proletarian revolutionaries, all Red Guards, should continue to uphold the spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion, take up Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon of criticism, stand at the forefront of the struggle, and conduct a thorough settlement of all anti-Marxist and anti-Mao Zedong Thought fallacies and influences of this number one capitalist-roader within the Party, seizing the thorough victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

    文化大革命更加深入的新阶段
    首都大专院校红代会核心组副组长、北师大井冈山负责人  谭厚兰
    《红旗》杂志第五期评论员文章和戚本禹同志的文章《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命的新的进军号，标志着无产阶级文化大革命的夺权斗争进入一个更加深入的新阶段。上海“一月革命”风暴，一开始主要是从组织上夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权；这场夺权斗争风起云涌，席卷全国。目前斗争的特点是矛头集中指向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，在政治思想上来个彻底批判，彻底清算。因为不从政治思想上彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的一切谬论，肃清其影响，铲除其流毒，用毛泽东思想去占领政治思想领域的一切阵地，就不能取得夺权斗争的最后胜利，组织上的夺权就不能最后巩固，修正主义的总根就不能拔除，还有可能死灰复燃。《红旗》杂志这两篇文章，在关键时刻，又给我们指出了斗争的大方向，这是一个伟大的战略步骤。这是关系到走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路，是要马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，还是要资本主义、修正主义的头等大事；这是关系到我们国家以至世界命运的头等大事；是把文化大革命进行到底，还是半途而废的头等大事；是百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。
    这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，是长期以来党内两条路线斗争中资产阶级反动路线的总根子，是这次文化大革命的两条路线斗争中资产阶级反动路线的总根子，是前一个时期各地反革命经济主义泛滥的总根子，也是最近自上而下的资本主义复辟逆流的总根子。擒贼先擒王，斩草必除根，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的批判，就是要挖我国修正主义的老根。
    中国革命的伟大实践证明，这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，从来就不是马克思主义者，从来就不是无产阶级革命家。他散布的理论，他提出的政策，他执行的路线，一贯地不是右，就是形“左”实右。他充其量不过是个资产阶级、小资产阶级革命家。他的流毒全党全国、甚至流毒世界的《修养》，没有丝毫马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的气味，没有丝毫无产阶级气味。实际上是封建社会政治、思想、道德的祖师爷孔孟的修养。而他竟然一版再版，要干部、党员、群众把这种乌七八糟的东西奉为“经典”，为资本主义复辟大作舆论准备。因此，必须彻底批判。
    当前开展的这场批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的斗争，是文化大革命中一场带决定意义的大斗争，所有无产阶级革命派，所有红卫兵小将，应当继续发扬无产阶级革命造反精神，拿起毛泽东思想这个最锐利的批判武器，站在斗争的最前列，把这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的一切反马克思主义、反毛泽东思想的谬论及其影响来个彻底的总清算，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
