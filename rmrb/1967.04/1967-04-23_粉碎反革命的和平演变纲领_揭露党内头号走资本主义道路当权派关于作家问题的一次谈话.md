Our great leader Chairman Mao says: “To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion, one must first do work in the ideological sphere. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this.” The top capitalist-roader in the Party, in his attempt to restore capitalism after the founding of the nation, started with “creating public opinion.” He is the backstage boss of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in the literary and artistic circles, led by Zhou Yang and Xia Yan. He is the mastermind behind the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line that opposes Chairman Mao’s revolutionary literary and artistic line.

In 1956, although the socialist transformation in the economic sector had basically been completed, the class struggle in the ideological sphere was still intense. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, revisionism rampaged internationally, and revisionism in the literary and artistic sphere was particularly rampant. The Petőfi Club in Hungary was a prominent example. This international trend further fueled the development of revisionism at home.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party thought the time was ripe for him and personally took charge of the literary and artistic circles. In early March 1956, he eagerly summoned counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang to his home, gave them instructions, and issued a black program for the peaceful evolution of the literary and artistic circles. Zhou Yang, having received the “imperial decree,” was overjoyed and immediately conveyed it in detail at the Party group and executive committee of the Chinese Writers Association.

What kind of goods did this black program peddle?

I

To prepare public opinion for his conspiracy to restore capitalism, the top capitalist-roader in the Party tried his best to cultivate writers into bourgeois literati. His method of cultivating writers was a blatant bourgeois expert line that opposed Chairman Mao’s literary and artistic line.

Chairman Mao repeatedly called for: “The revolutionary writers and artists of China, the writers and artists with a future, must go to the masses, must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly. They must go to the fiery struggles.” However, when the top capitalist-roader in the Party talked about how to cultivate amateur writers, he openly opposed Chairman Mao’s instruction. He instructed Zhou Yang and others: “We find that there are indeed talents among them (because literature and art are different from other work, they need special talents), and we can bring them out to professionalize them, to make them writers.”

He also talked about “experiencing life.” How should writers go to the masses? He said: “Even a very short period can do.” In reality, what he emphasized was “professionalization,” which was to make amateur writers detach from the fiery struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to cultivate “nobles who stand above the ‘lower class’ people,” to cultivate bourgeois artists, and to breed Petőfi Clubs in the literary and artistic circles. By 1964, he even shamelessly said: “If artists go to the countryside and encounter difficulties, they can go by car, and writers can cook and sleep in the car.” This was to make cultural workers become bourgeois lords detached from the masses, which fully exposed the filthy soul of this “great man” who often talked about “cultivation.”

To “provide conditions” for writers’ creation, the top capitalist-roader in the Party instructed the Chinese Writers Association and its branches to “establish a fund committee” to “provide necessary travel expenses or creation subsidies for excellent amateur writers who are members and non-members.” Under the personal planning of Zhou Yang and others, the Writers Association established high-level guesthouses for writers in scenic areas such as Xishan, Summer Palace, and Beidaihe in Beijing, and was planning to build a writers’ apartment in Beijing, doing everything possible to provide convenient conditions for those writer lords to live in luxury.

For many years, the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line led by Zhou Yang and Xia Yan had been “cultivating” writers according to his black instructions. The result of such “cultivation” could only make cultural workers become officials and lords, not to invest themselves in the fiery struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, not to reflect the socialist revolution and construction, and to become new spiritual nobles. The “prodigy” Liu Shaotang, after being transferred to become a professional writer, degenerated and fell into a rightist element, which was a shocking example.

II

The top capitalist-roader in the Party, known for his advocacy of “cultivation,” talked about writers’ “cultivation” in a way that was thoroughly anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, just like his infamous book “Cultivation.”

Chairman Mao taught us: “Intellectuals who are writers and artists must change their thoughts and feelings and undergo a transformation if they want their works to be welcomed by the masses.” He also emphasized that a revolutionary writer must “study Marxism-Leninism and study society.” However, how did the top capitalist-roader in the Party call for cultural workers to undergo “cultivation”? He said: “Our writers, if they want to become good professional writers, should have rich knowledge, should understand natural science (should also understand the atomic bomb, now it is the atomic age), chemistry, algebra, geometry, calculus, should also understand historical knowledge and world literature knowledge, at least should understand one foreign language.” He adopted an intolerable attitude of a noble lord towards the struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and towards the literary and artistic authors who emerged from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, mockingly saying that “knowing only a little about the common people, not knowing world knowledge, being only a local writer is not enough.”

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang admired this backstage boss’s fallacies and said in his transmission: “A certain comrade emphasized this point. Let those talented people professionalize, let them study history, study literature, give them conditions, and lay a good foundation for them to become great writers.” No wonder Zhou Yang gave speeches everywhere in 1956, talking about writers’ “insufficient knowledge,” “being proficient in ancient and modern Chinese and foreign classics,” and bowing to bourgeois writers as teachers, but never mentioning studying Mao Zedong Thought or transforming worldviews. The list of books for writers’ further study ordered by Zhou Yang and his gang from the Writers Association, from “The Red and the Black” to “Quiet Flows the Don,” had more than a hundred kinds of poisonous weeds, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, but not a single work by Chairman Mao.

The joint conference of the Chinese Writers Association and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League held on March 15, 1956, was convened according to the instructions of the top capitalist-roader in the Party. Zhou Yang again peddled these black goods to young writers at the conference, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan talked about “knowledge is power.” They brought in some Party and non-Party bourgeois “authorities” to spread their poison, corrupting a large number of young authors.

III

In this talk, the top capitalist-roader in the Party also crazily advocated the fallacy of absolute freedom in creation, opposed the Party’s leadership in creation, and abolished class struggle on the literary and artistic front.

Chairman Mao taught us: “The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism.” He also instructed us: “All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters, must be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely.” However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party sang a different tune, openly resisting Mao Zedong Thought, opposing acting according to Mao Zedong Thought, and shouting: “What if a writer’s work is not approved, or a script is not allowed to be performed, or published, or the writer is asked to revise it? … There should be official documents. … Do not speak orally, oral opinions do not count.” Zhou Yang complained to him: “Some opinions are from responsible comrades. After they saw this play or that work, they said a word, and this word carries great weight.” He replied decisively: “They can express their thoughts, but whether you adopt them or not, or whether you modify them according to their opinions, you have your freedom.” Here, he desperately advocated the fallacy of so-called creative “freedom,” which in essence was to give ghosts and monsters the “freedom” to carry out the restoration of capitalism. On the literary and artistic front, a large number of poisonous weeds emerged since 1957, which was the green light he opened.

Even more vile was that in this talk, he blatantly directed his spearhead at our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought is our highest directive. In the literary and artistic sphere, Chairman Mao brilliantly, comprehensively, and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic theory. The direction indicated by Chairman Mao is the direction of literary and artistic revolution in China and the world. However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party shouted for writers not to listen to Chairman Mao’s words, with the purpose of carrying out peaceful evolution in China’s literary and artistic circles, making the literary and artistic circles a propaganda front for the restoration of capitalism.

For seventeen years, the heads of the literary and artistic black line, the counter-revolutionary revisionists Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, had implemented bourgeois dictatorship in the cultural departments and committed heinous crimes against the Party and the people. Now, this small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists and their backstage boss have been exposed by the masses. We must press on with our victories, thoroughly uproot the revisionist literary and artistic black line, carry out the proletarian cultural revolution in the literary and artistic circles to the end, and firmly plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on every literary and artistic front!

    粉碎反革命的和平演变纲领
    ——揭露党内头号走资本主义道路当权派关于作家问题的一次谈话
    新北大公社红尖兵革命造反团　中国作家协会革命造反团
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，在建国后妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶活动，也是从“先造成舆论”开始的。他就是文艺界反革命修正主义分子周扬、夏衍一伙的后台老板，他就是对抗毛主席革命文艺路线的反革命修正主义文艺黑线的幕后总指挥。
    一九五六年，我国经济战线上在所有制方面的社会主义改造虽然基本完成，但是政治思想领域中的阶级斗争还很激烈。苏共召开“二十大”以后，国际上修正主义大肆泛滥，文学艺术方面的修正主义表现得特别猖狂，匈牙利的裴多菲俱乐部，就是一个突出的例子。国际上的这股逆流，更助长了国内修正主义逆流的发展。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，以为时机对他有利，就亲自抓起文艺界来了。一九五六年三月初，他迫不及待地把反革命修正主义分子周扬等人叫到自己家里，面授机宜，抛出了一个文艺界和平演变的黑纲领。周扬得了“圣旨”，欣喜若狂，立即在中国作家协会党组和理事会上作了详细传达。
    这个黑纲领贩卖的是些什么货色呢？
    一
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为了给他复辟资本主义的阴谋作舆论准备，极力想把作家培养成资产阶级的文人。他培养作家的办法，是一条明目张胆地和毛主席文艺路线相对抗的资产阶级专家路线。
    毛主席一再号召：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”。而党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在谈到如何培养业余作家时，却公然对抗毛主席的这一指示，他指示周扬等人说：“我们发现其中确实有天才的（因为文学艺术和其他工作不同，需要特殊的天才），就可以调出来使他们专业化，让他们当作家。”
    他也谈“体验生活”。作家怎样到群众中去呢？他说：“哪怕是很短一个时期也可以”。实际上，他所强调的“专业化”，是为了使业余作者脱离工农兵火热的斗争生活，培养“高踞于‘下等人’头上的贵族”，培养资产阶级的文艺家，繁殖文艺界一个个的裴多菲俱乐部。到了一九六四年，他甚至无耻地说：“文艺家下乡去如果有困难，可以开轿车去，作家可以在车上做饭睡觉。”这是要使文艺工作者成为脱离群众的资产阶级老爷，这也充分暴露了这位常讲“修养”的“大人物”的肮脏灵魂。
    为了给作家创作“提供条件”，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派还指示中国作家协会及作协各分会“设立基金委员会”，“供给会员及非会员的优秀的业余写作者以必要的旅行费用或创作津贴”。在周扬等人亲自规划下，作家协会在北京西山、颐和园以及北戴河等风景区设立了专供作家写作的高级招待所，还在北京筹建作家公寓，极力为那些作家老爷提供养尊处优的方便条件。
    多年来，周扬、夏衍为首的反革命修正主义文艺黑线正是按照他的黑指示来“培养”作家的。这样“培养”的结果，只能使文艺工作者做官当老爷，不投身到工农兵群众的火热斗争中去，不去反映社会主义革命和建设，成为新的精神贵族。“神童”刘绍棠调出当专业作家以后蜕化变质，堕落成右派分子，就是一个触目惊心的例子。
    二
    以讲“修养”著称的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在谈到作家的“修养”时，和他那本臭名昭著的《修养》一样，是彻头彻尾的反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的。
    毛主席教导我们：“知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。”并且强调指出，一个革命作家必须“学习马克思列宁主义和学习社会。”而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是怎样叫文艺工作者进行“修养”的呢？他说：“我们的作家，如果要成为一个好的专业的作家，应该具有丰富的知识，应该懂得自然科学（也应该懂得原子弹，现在是原子能时代）、化学、代数、几何、微积分，也应该懂得历史知识和世界文学知识，至少应该懂得一种外国文。”他对工农兵群众的斗争生活，对从工农兵群众中涌现出来的文艺作者，摆出一副令人不能容忍的贵族老爷态度，嘲笑地说什么“只懂得关于老百姓的一点东西，不知道世界知识，只当一个土作家是不行的”。
    反革命修正主义分子周扬对这个后台老板的谬论十分钦佩，他在传达时说：“某某同志很强调这点。要让那些有天才的人专业化，让他们学习历史，学习文学，给他们条件，为使他们成为一个大作家打好基础。”怪不得周扬在一九五六年到处作报告，大谈作家“知识不足”呀，“要通晓古今中外的名著”呀，要拜资产阶级作家为师呀，就是不提学习毛泽东思想，不提世界观的改造。周扬一伙下令作协开列的一整套作家进修书目，从《红与黑》到《静静的顿河》，古今中外丛丛毒草不下百余种，唯独没有毛主席著作。
    一九五六年三月十五日，中国作家协会和团中央联合召开的全国青年文学创作者会议，就是按照党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的旨意召开的。周扬在会上又向青年作家再次贩卖了他的这些黑货，反革命修正主义分子夏衍则大谈“知识就是力量”。他们把一些党内外的资产阶级“权威”拉来，大放其毒，毒害了大批青年作者。
    三
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在这次讲话里，还疯狂鼓吹创作的绝对自由化的滥调，反对党对创作的领导，取消文艺战线上的阶级斗争。
    毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”他又指示我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”但是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却大唱反调，公开抵制毛泽东思想，反对照毛泽东思想办事，大肆叫嚣：“一个作家写的作品没有被通过，或是一个剧本不让上演，不让发表，或是让作家再改，这怎么办呢？……应有正式文件。……不要口头讲，口头上发表议论不能算数。”周扬向他抱怨说：“有的意见是负责同志讲的，他们看了这个戏或者那个作品以后说了一句话，这句话的分量很大。”他断然回答：“他们可以发表他们的感想，至于你采纳不采纳，或者是不是按他们的意见修改，你有你的自由。”在这里他拚命鼓吹所谓创作“自由”的谬论，实质上就是要给牛鬼蛇神进行资本主义复辟的“自由”。文艺战线上，一九五七年以来大量的毒草出笼，正是他开的绿灯。
    更为恶毒的是，他这一次谈话，竟然明目张胆地把矛头指向我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。毛泽东思想是我们的最高指示。在文艺方面，毛主席天才地全面地创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的文艺理论。毛主席所指示的文艺方向，是我国和世界无产阶级革命文艺的方向。但是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却叫嚷要作家不听毛主席的话，他的目的就是要在我国文艺界实行和平演变，使文艺界成为复辟资本主义的舆论阵地。
    十七年来，文艺黑线的头目反革命修正主义分子周扬、夏衍一伙，在文化部门实行了资产阶级专政，对党、对人民犯下了滔天的罪行。现在这一小撮反革命修正主义分子和他们的总后台已被广大群众揪出来了。我们一定要乘胜追击，彻底挖掉修正主义文艺黑线，把文艺界的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗牢固地插遍一切文艺阵地！
