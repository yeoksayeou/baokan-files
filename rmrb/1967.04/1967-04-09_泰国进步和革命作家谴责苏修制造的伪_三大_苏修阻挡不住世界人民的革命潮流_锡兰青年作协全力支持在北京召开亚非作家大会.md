Outgoing representatives of the Thai writers' delegation to the 1966 emergency meeting of Asian and African writers in Beijing, led by Kura Jibali, issued a statement yesterday on behalf of Thai progressive and revolutionary writers. The statement strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists' fabricated "Third Congress of Asian and African Writers" held in Beirut. The statement pointed out that the fabricated "Third Congress" is the latest vile act by Soviet revisionists to sabotage the anti-imperialist unity of Asian and African writers, and is a new crime of betrayal of the Asian and African peoples and of serving the U.S. imperialists.

The statement said that the Soviet revisionists have shamelessly carried out splitist activities within the Asian and African writers' movement, suffering one failure after another. This time, at the fabricated Beirut meeting, the Soviet revisionists actually begged for financial aid from the U.N. Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, which is a tool of U.S. imperialism. This is a sellout of the Asian and African writers' movement to U.S. imperialism and once again proves that the Soviet revisionists are spies for U.S. imperialism in the Asian and African writers' movement, and that their activities are in the service of U.S. imperialist interests and are hostile to the Asian and African peoples who are currently engaged in a life-and-death struggle against U.S. imperialism. The statement said that in the era of Mao Zedong Thought illuminating the world, the Soviet revisionists' attempt to block the surging revolutionary tide of the world's peoples is doomed to failure. Their line of capitulation to U.S. imperialism will inevitably suffer a comprehensive bankruptcy and end up isolated like the U.S. imperialists.

The statement pointed out that Chairman Mao Zedong has said, "The correct things are developed in the struggle against the incorrect things." The Asian and African writers' movement, holding high the banner of the anti-U.S. revolutionary line, has become stronger and more united through unremitting struggle against the counter-revolutionary line of the Soviet revisionist writers' group and their followers. Through the struggle between the two lines, revolutionary Asian and African writers will unite more closely.

The statement said that the Soviet revisionists' obstruction of the legitimate Third Congress of Asian and African Writers and the Fifth Congress of Asian and African People's Solidarity to be held in China not only shows their fear of the anti-imperialist revolutionary movement of the Asian and African peoples but also shows their particular fear of the great proletarian cultural revolution in China and the banner of victory of the world's peoples' revolution—the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The statement wished the Third Congress of Asian and African Writers, to be held in Beijing this year, a resounding success. This will be an unprecedented great victory for the Asian and African writers' movement's revolutionary line against U.S. imperialism and a most shameful defeat for the Soviet revisionists' counter-revolutionary line.

	The New China News Agency reported from Colombo that the Sri Lankan Young Writers' Association issued a statement on March 31st strongly condemning the fabricated "Third Congress of Asian and African Writers" orchestrated by Soviet revisionists in Beirut. The statement also fully supported the Third Congress of Asian and African Writers to be held in Beijing this year.

The statement said that the purpose of the fabricated "Third Congress of Asian and African Writers" is to "sabotage the revolutionary spirit and lofty fighting tradition of Asian and African writers."

The statement said: "The Sri Lankan Young Writers' Association strongly condemns this fabricated congress and guarantees to provide full support and cooperation for the successful holding of the genuine Asian and African Writers' Congress in Beijing this year."

    泰国进步和革命作家谴责苏修制造的伪“三大”
    苏修阻挡不住世界人民的革命潮流
    锡兰青年作协全力支持在北京召开亚非作家大会
    新华社七日讯　出席过一九六六年六月在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议的泰国作家代表团团长古腊·柿巴立，代表泰国进步和革命作家在昨天发表声明，强烈谴责苏修在贝鲁特召开的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”。声明指出，伪“三大”是苏联修正主义者蓄意破坏亚非作家反帝战斗团结的最新的卑鄙行为，是苏联修正主义者对亚非人民的背叛和为美帝效劳的新罪行。
    声明说，苏联修正主义者在亚非作家运动中无耻地进行分裂活动，遭到了一次又一次的失败。这次伪贝鲁特会议，苏联修正主义者竟向美帝国主义的工具联合国教育、科学及文化组织乞求金钱援助，这是把亚非作家运动出卖给美帝，并再一次证明了苏联修正主义者是美帝国主义在亚非作家运动中的奸细，他们的活动是为美帝利益效劳的，是同当前正在与美帝进行殊死斗争的亚非人民敌对的。声明说，在毛泽东思想的光辉普照世界的时代，苏联修正主义硬要阻挡世界人民汹涌的革命潮流，必将一败涂地。他们投降美帝国主义的路线，必将遭到全面的破产以致和美帝一样被孤立。
    声明指出，毛泽东主席曾说过：“正确的东西总是在同错误的东西作斗争的过程中发展起来的。”亚非作家运动高举反美革命路线旗帜，已经在与苏联修正主义作家集团以及他们的追随者的反革命路线坚持不懈的斗争中巩固强大起来。通过两条路线的斗争，革命的亚非作家必将更加紧密地团结起来。
    声明说，苏联修正主义对于即将在中国召开的合法的第三届亚非作家大会和第五届亚非人民团结大会进行阻挠，除了说明他们惧怕亚非人民的反帝革命运动之外，还说明他们尤其惧怕伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命，惧怕世界人民革命的胜利的旗帜——伟大的毛泽东思想。
    声明祝愿将于今年在北京举行的第三届亚非作家大会，一定会取得空前巨大的胜利。这将是亚非作家运动反对美帝国主义的革命路线的史无前例的巨大胜利，也将是苏联修正主义者反革命路线的最可耻的惨败。
    新华社科伦坡电　锡兰青年作家协会三月三十一日在这里发表声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义者一手策划的、在贝鲁特召开的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”，并且全力支持将于今年在北京召开的第三届亚非作家大会。
    声明说，伪“第三届亚非作家大会”的目的是要“破坏亚非作家的革命精神和崇高的战斗传统”。
    声明说：“锡兰青年作家协会对这次伪大会提出最强烈的谴责，同时保证要对今年在北京召开真正的亚非作家大会的成功给予全力支持和合作。”
