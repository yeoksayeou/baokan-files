Burmese youths are full of enthusiasm in praising the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

They extol Mao's works as the priceless treasure and the most powerful ideological weapon for the world's revolutionary people.

Two Burmese youth workers told their Chinese friends that they have unlimited faith in Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is forever the guiding light on their road ahead." They said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon for the world's people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and all reactionaries. The light of Mao Zedong Thought has shone into the hearts of the world's people. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the entire globe. Therefore, imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are barking like dogs in a desperate situation, viciously attacking Mao Zedong Thought. However, this only indicates that their doom is approaching and does not diminish the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought in the slightest."

The two young workers pointed out that at a time when the world's number one enemy, U.S. imperialism, is escalating the war of aggression in Vietnam and playing the "peace talks" trick, and when Soviet modern revisionism is using various conspiracies to sabotage the world's people's struggle against imperialism and for national liberation, "it is Chairman Mao's great works that, like a lighthouse with rays of light, help the people to distinguish between enemies and friends, heighten their revolutionary vigilance, see through the enemy's tricks, dare to struggle, dare to make revolution, and fear no sacrifice to win the final victory."

Some Burmese youths wrote in a letter to their Chinese friends that Chairman Mao's works are the priceless treasure and classic works of the revolutionary people. They said, "The more deeply the revolutionaries grasp and understand Chairman Mao's theories, the more mature the proletarian ideology becomes, the higher the revolutionary spirit soars, and the more they can blend in with the people and fight alongside them."

They said: "Chairman Mao's works have creatively developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times." They said, "Once the revolutionary people correctly grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought, they will fear nothing from all the ghosts and monsters in the world, dare to struggle, fear no sacrifice, and imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries will become paper tigers in their eyes."

Several Burmese youth teachers wrote in a letter to their Chinese friends: "Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our times. His brilliant revolutionary theories and thoughts have armed the oppressed people, making them rise up to struggle against the oppressors. Chairman Mao's dictum that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' is the easiest for revolutionary people to accept. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have risen in revolt based on Chairman Mao's wise dictum. 'A single spark can start a prairie fire.' Imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries will surely be drowned in the revolutionary sea of people's uprisings."

They said, "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the 700 million Chinese people but also the great leader of the world's revolutionary people. Now, only the great Chairman Mao can represent the world's proletariat and lead them in their struggle for liberation."

They enthusiastically praised the People's Republic of China as "the fortress of world revolution." They said: "The great China created by Mao Zedong Thought is a reliable pillar in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism." "All the glorious achievements of China are the result of acting according to the instructions of the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao."

    缅甸朋友称颂毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的最强大武器
    在革命人民面前帝修反都是纸老虎
    新华社仰光电　缅甸青年满怀热情地赞扬世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想。
    他们称颂毛主席著作是世界革命人民的无价之宝和进行革命的最强有力的思想武器。
    两位缅甸青年工人向他们的中国朋友表示，他们无限信仰毛泽东思想。他们说，战无不胜的毛泽东思想永远是他们前进道路上的指路明灯。他们说，毛泽东思想是世界人民对美帝国主义、苏联修正主义和一切反动派进行斗争的最强有力的思想武器。毛泽东思想已经深入世界人民的心，毛泽东思想的光辉照耀着全世界。因此，帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派象陷入绝境的狗一样在狂叫，恶毒地攻击毛泽东思想。然而，这只能说明它们的末日即将到来，丝毫无损于毛泽东思想的光辉。
    这两位青年工人指出，正当世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义在越南扩大侵略战争和玩弄“和谈”骗局的时候，正当苏联现代修正主义使用各种阴谋诡计，破坏世界人民反对帝国主义、争取民族解放斗争的时候，“是毛主席的伟大著作象光芒万丈的革命灯塔一样，使人民划清敌友之间的界线，提高自己的革命警惕性，识破敌人的诡计，敢于斗争，敢于闹革命，不怕牺牲，去夺取最后胜利。”
    一些缅甸青年在写给他们的中国朋友的信中说，毛主席著作是革命人民的无价之宝，是革命的经典著作。革命者掌握和领会毛主席的理论越深刻，无产阶级思想就越成熟，革命精神就越高昂，就越能同人民打成一片，同他们一起战斗。
    他们说：“毛主席著作创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。”他们说，革命人民一旦正确地掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想，他们就不怕世界上一切牛鬼蛇神的捣乱，敢于斗争，不怕牺牲，帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派就在他们的面前变成了纸老虎。
    几位缅甸青年教师在写给他们的中国朋友的信中说：“毛泽东是当代的列宁，他的光辉的革命理论和革命思想武装了被压迫的人民，使他们起来同压迫者进行斗争。毛主席的‘枪杆子里面出政权’的论断，最容易为革命人民所接受。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民根据毛主席的这一英明论断起来造反了。‘星星之火，可以燎原’。帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派一定会淹没在各国人民造反的革命火海中。”
    他们说，毛主席不仅是七亿中国人民的伟大领袖，而且也是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖。现在世界上只有伟大的毛主席能够代表全世界的无产阶级和领导他们进行解放斗争。
    他们热情地赞扬中华人民共和国是“世界革命的堡垒”。他们说：“用毛泽东思想缔造的伟大中国，是同美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义进行斗争的可靠支柱。”“中国所取得的一切辉煌成就，是按照伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的指示办事的结果。”
