Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force. They are the most eager to learn, the least conservative, especially in the socialist era."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is fostering millions of revolutionary young people. The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are being tempered in the storms of class struggle.

The broad revolutionary youth, nurtured under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are the most loyal Red Guards of Chairman Mao. They love Chairman Mao boundlessly and are loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought. They stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, striking hard at the bourgeois reactionary line, overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly smashing the "four olds" of the exploiting classes, and establishing the "four news" of the proletariat, thus making immortal contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country.

In the current stage where the revolutionary masses are uniting to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the revolutionary youth have again made new contributions and achievements.

Together with the broad masses of workers and peasants, they have thoroughly smashed the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, becoming revolutionary pioneers in the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

They actively engage in revolutionary mass rallies, unite the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and form a vast army of cultural revolutionaries.

They study and apply Chairman Mao's works, implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, and, in accordance with the principle of "revolution knows no precedence," have carried out the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

They have displayed precious revolutionary initiative and creativity. At this critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, they have put forward the revolutionary slogan of "while seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, also seizing power from the 'self' in one's own mind." Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they have overcome non-proletarian thoughts and greatly enhanced the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the broad proletarian revolutionary ranks.

They bravely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary policy of the "three-in-one combination," and strike head-on against the capitalist restorationist tide.

The heroic deeds of the revolutionary youth are indelible. They are indeed the vanguards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and have always embodied the revolutionary direction.

Of course, we must also analyze the revolutionary youth from a class perspective.

Old China was a country with a large number of petty bourgeoisie, and various petty bourgeois and bourgeois ideologies inevitably reflected within the ranks of the revolutionary youth.

At this critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes and the two lines, when class struggle is extremely sharp and complex, non-proletarian thoughts such as sectarianism, individualism, anarchism, and personalism will also reflect within the ranks of the revolutionary youth. This is not surprising. Due to a lack of fighting experience and political immaturity, and not being good at class analysis, some revolutionaries often make various mistakes at critical turning points in the revolution. If the revolutionary youth do not face up to their own shortcomings and mistakes, and allow various non-proletarian thoughts to spread in their minds, there is a danger of being used by class enemies.

It must be pointed out that the essence of the millions of revolutionary youth who have been fighting on the front lines of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is good, and the mainstream is good. We should actively and patiently guide them to overcome non-proletarian thoughts with proletarian thoughts. At the same time, we must also believe that the revolutionary youth nurtured under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be able to educate and liberate themselves. If anyone fails to see this, they will make a grave mistake.

How to treat the revolutionary youth is a question of how to view the struggle between the two lines over the past few months, a question of how to view the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mass movement, a question of whether to stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line or on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line, and a major question of whether to cultivate and foster successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. If the revolutionary youth are denied, then the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is denied. If the revolutionary youth are suppressed, then the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is suppressed.

Currently, a counter-revolutionary tide of capitalist restoration is emerging in society. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are playing tricks on the revolutionary youth, sowing discord among them, splitting the ranks of the revolutionary youth, and attempting to lead the revolutionary youth astray. At the same time, they cry wolf, accusing those who have consistently advocated the reactionary policy of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" in the matter of cadres, of being the proposers of the bourgeois reactionary line, and attacking the revolutionary youth. They collude with the ghosts and snakes in society, seize on certain shortcomings and mistakes of the revolutionary youth, attack one point and ignore the rest, completely deny the revolutionary direction of the revolutionary youth, and even manipulate the already collapsed conservative organizations to carry out rehabilitation activities, labeling some revolutionary youth as "counter-revolutionaries" again. What they are doing is opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and denying the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the previous stage. We must resolutely counterattack and thoroughly smash this tide!

Some cadres have executed the bourgeois reactionary line and stood against the revolutionary youth. Now, most of them have already or are returning to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and standing with the revolutionary youth. However, there are a few cadres who, because the revolutionary youth have criticized and struggled against their mistakes, harbor resentment towards the revolutionary youth, doubt the revolutionary direction of the revolutionary youth, and even oppose them. If they insist on doing so, the nature of the contradiction may change, which is very dangerous. All revolutionary cadres should stand up and, together with the revolutionary youth and the revolutionary masses, actively participate in the criticism of the "striking down a large number and protecting a few" component of the bourgeois reactionary line, directing the struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and at the greatest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road.

The struggle of the revolutionary masses to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is a decisive battle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The struggle is fierce and will have twists and turns. However, the frenzy of the class enemy is merely a desperate struggle, and there is nothing to be afraid of! Their failure is inevitable! "The plum blossoms rejoice in the snow, freezing a fly is nothing to boast about." Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will definitely triumph!

Young revolutionary youth, you must deeply understand that you bear a great historical mission in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. You must always be loyal to Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. You must study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, humbly learn from revolutionary old cadres and the great People's Liberation Army, combine with the workers and peasants, break with the self and establish the public, and continuously raise your class consciousness and policy level. You must dare to uphold the truth and correct mistakes. Strive to achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," win the united struggle to seize power, and make new and greater contributions to the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Revolutionary youth, closely follow our great commander Chairman Mao and carry the revolution through to the end!

### 正确地对待革命小将

    正确地对待革命小将
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。他们最肯学习，最少保守思想，在社会主义时代尤其是这样。”
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，正在造就千百万革命小将。无产阶级革命事业的接班人，正在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼成长。
    在毛泽东思想哺育下生长壮大的广大革命小将，是毛主席最忠实的红卫兵。他们无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于伟大的毛泽东思想。他们站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，痛击资产阶级反动路线，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大破剥削阶级“四旧”，大立无产阶级“四新”，为我国的无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。
    在当前，无产阶级革命派联合起来，实行革命的“三结合”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的新阶段中，革命小将又立下了新的功勋，作出了新的贡献。
    他们和广大工农群众一道，彻底粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，成了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权斗争的革命闯将。
    他们积极地进行革命的大串连，实行无产阶级革命派的大联合，团结广大革命群众，组成了一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军。
    他们活学活用毛主席著作，贯彻毛主席的干部政策，按照“革命不分先后”的原则，实行了革命的“三结合”。
    他们发扬了可贵的革命自觉性和创造性，在两个阶级的决战时刻，提出了“在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的同时，向自己头脑中‘私’字夺权”的革命口号，用毛泽东思想为武器，克服非无产阶级思想，大大加强了广大无产阶级革命队伍的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。
    他们勇敢地捍卫毛主席的革命的“三结合”方针，迎头痛击资本主义复辟逆流。
    革命小将的英雄业绩，是任何人也抹煞不了的。他们不愧为无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋，他们始终体现了革命的大方向。
    当然，对于革命小将也必须作阶级分析。
    旧中国是一个小资产阶级人数众多的国家，各种小资产阶级、资产阶级思潮，必然会反映到革命小将队伍内部来。
    在当前两个阶级、两条路线的决战时刻，阶级斗争异常尖锐复杂的情况下，风头主义、小团体主义、无政府主义、个人主义等非无产阶级思想，也会反映到革命小将的队伍中来。这并不奇怪。由于缺乏斗争经验，政治上还不成熟，对事物不善于作阶级分析，因此在革命发展的转折关头，一些革命者往往容易犯这样那样的错误。革命小将如果不能正视自己的缺点和错误，任凭各种非无产阶级思想在自己头脑里泛滥，那就有被阶级敌人利用的危险。
    必须指出，为无产阶级文化大革命冲锋陷阵的千百万革命小将的本质是好的，主流是好的。对革命小将队伍中的各种非无产阶级思想，我们应该积极地耐心引导他们用无产阶级思想去加以克服。同时也要相信，在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的革命小将，一定能够自己教育自己，自己解放自己。如果谁看不到这一点，那就要犯绝大的错误。
    如何对待革命小将，是如何看待几个月来两条路线斗争的问题，是如何对待无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的问题，是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边的阶级立场问题，是要不要培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的重大问题。如果否定革命小将，便是否定无产阶级文化大革命。如果打击革命小将，便是打击无产阶级文化大革命。
    当前，社会上出现了一股资本主义复辟的反革命逆流。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对革命小将玩弄阴谋诡计，在革命小将之间播弄是非，拉一批，打一批，妄图分裂革命小将的队伍，将革命小将引向邪路。同时，他们贼喊捉贼，把那几个资产阶级反动路线的提出者一贯主张的在干部问题上的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，强加在革命小将头上，攻击革命小将。他们勾结社会上的牛鬼蛇神，抓住革命小将的某些缺点、错误不放，攻其一点，不及其余，全盘否定革命小将的大方向，甚至操纵已垮台的保守派组织进行翻案活动，把一些革命小将重新打成“反革命”。他们这样做，就是反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是否定前阶段的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。对于这股逆流，我们必须坚决回击，彻底粉碎！
    有些干部曾经执行了资产阶级反动路线，站到了革命小将的对面。现在，他们当中的大部分人已经和正在回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，同革命小将站在一起。但是，也有少数干部，因为革命小将对他们的错误进行过批判斗争，就对革命小将抱有抵触情绪，怀疑革命小将的大方向，甚至和他们对抗。如果坚持这样做，矛盾的性质就可能转化，这是很危险的。一切革命的干部，应当站出来，同革命小将一起，同革命群众一起，积极参加批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分，将斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，指向党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。
    无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级的决战。斗争是激烈的，也会有曲折和反复。但是，阶级敌人的疯狂，毕竟是垂死的挣扎，没有什么了不起！他们的失败是注定了的！“梅花欢喜漫天雪，冻死苍蝇未足奇。”毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一定胜利！
    年轻的革命小将们，一定要深刻地认识到，你们在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，肩负着重大的历史使命。你们一定要永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。一定要更加刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，虚心地向革命的老干部和伟大的人民解放军学习，与工农群众相结合，破私立公，不断提高阶级觉悟和政策水平。一定要敢于坚持真理，勇于修正错误。为争取实现革命的“三结合”，取得联合夺权斗争的胜利，为争取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，作出新的更大的贡献！
    革命小将们，紧紧跟着我们伟大的统帅毛主席，将革命进行到底！
