On this day last year, the magazine *Frontline* and the former *Beijing Daily* published a batch of materials about the "Three-Family Village" and *Night Talks on Yan Mountain*, along with a carefully crafted editorial note. This was the infamous "April 16" counter-revolutionary political conspiracy, which was a fake criticism and a true cover-up, sacrificing pawns to protect the generals.

The mastermind behind this counter-revolutionary political conspiracy was the head of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee and the person behind the scenes supporting the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party.

Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot' is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people ultimately only serve to promote a broader and more intense revolution among the people."

The small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Committee and the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party are just such a bunch of fools. They played tricks and schemed, attempting to escape the punishment of the revolutionary people and seize the opportunity to rise again. However, history is ruthless. In the face of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, they have shamefully failed!

Over the past year, our heroic motherland has undergone a tremendous transformation. The red storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has swept across the entire country and shaken the world! It has destroyed one reactionary stronghold after another, sweeping away all the dregs and remnants of the old society, and touching the souls of everyone. The reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, represented by the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, has suffered a crushing defeat and is continuing to suffer more defeats; the revolutionary line of the proletariat, represented by Chairman Mao, has achieved great victories and is continuing to achieve more victories. The thought of Mao Zedong is occupying more and more ground.

The reactionary rule of the former Beijing Municipal Committee has been overthrown!

The backer of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, has been exposed!

For seventeen years, a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Committee, with the support of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, have consistently waved the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. In the political, economic, and ideological fields, they have implemented a thorough counter-revolutionary revisionist line, launching a frenzied and comprehensive attack on the Party, socialism, and the thought of Mao Zedong.

They maliciously slandered our great leader Chairman Mao, viciously attacking our great leader Chairman Mao; they passionately praised the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party.

They were extremely afraid of the thought of Mao Zedong, extremely hostile to it, and fiercely opposed to it, using every means to sabotage the great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; they forcibly peddled the anti-Mao Zedong thought poisonous weed *Cultivation*.

They stubbornly opposed Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, vigorously advocating the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," peddling the revisionist goods of "class cooperation" and "peace within the Party" propagated by the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party.

They colluded with the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat and implement the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie; against the revolutionary masses who resisted and opposed their counter-revolutionary revisionist rule, they used threats, bribes, and all kinds of means to suppress and frame them.

They opposed emphasizing proletarian politics, vigorously emphasizing bourgeois politics, vigorously peddling the reactionary economism of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, promoting material incentives, implementing the leadership of business, technology, and money, attempting to lead the broad masses of the people into the capitalist and revisionist quagmire.

Under the indulgence of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, they used all the propaganda tools they controlled to spread a large amount of feudal, capitalist, and revisionist poison, shooting arrows of *Hairui Dismissed from Office*, *Night Talks on Yan Mountain*, *Three-Family Village Notes*, and other poisonous weeds at the Party, socialism, and the thought of Mao Zedong, creating public opinion for the subversion of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the restoration of the capitalist system.

They opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian educational policy, vigorously promoting the revisionist educational policy proposed by the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, guiding students to be "expert" but not red, separating them from proletarian politics, and cultivating successors for their restoration of capitalism.

They faithfully carried out the revisionist organizational line of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, recruiting and absorbing traitors, forming cliques, networking everywhere to gather ghosts and snakes, placing their trusted followers, turning Beijing into an "independent kingdom" where no one can penetrate.

They fiercely opposed the socialist education movement in cities and countryside, actively promoting the opportunist line of "left" in form but right in essence of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, shielding a small group of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and brutally suppressing the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres.

Under the support of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, they frantically sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resisted the criticism of *Hairui Dismissed from Office*, attempting to lead the serious political struggle to the wrong path of "pure academic" discussion, shielding the bourgeois rightists, surrounding and attacking the proletarian leftists, dreaming of extinguishing the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ignited by Chairman Mao himself....

The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee is cunning and vicious, ambitious, and has committed countless evil deeds! They are a group of enemies who have infiltrated our "liver," a time bomb hidden beside Chairman Mao, a vicious counter-revolutionary coup group, and the vanguard of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party's conspiracy to usurp the Party and the state!

The heinous crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee must be thoroughly settled!

The counter-revolutionary revisionist line implemented by the former Beijing Municipal Committee must be thoroughly criticized!

The counter-revolutionary revisionist ruling machine of the former Beijing Municipal Committee must be thoroughly smashed!

The small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Committee must be thoroughly overthrown, smashed, and exposed!

Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power."

The struggle between the revolutionary faction of the proletariat and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee is a struggle for power, a struggle between the restoration of the bourgeoisie and the counter-restoration of the proletariat.

Thoroughly defeating the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee and thoroughly purging all its poisonous influences is a major task related to carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, a major task related to consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, a major task related to the future and destiny of our Party and state, and a major task related to the future and destiny of the world revolution.

Currently, the country is carrying out a mass criticism of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party. Thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee is a deepening of this mass criticism. We must closely combine the criticism of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party with the criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee and the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our own units and departments, pushing the mass criticism to a new high.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." The twelfth issue of *Red Flag* in 1966 pointed out: "Concentrating forces to strike at a small group of bourgeois rightists and the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party is the direction of the struggle." The revolutionary faction of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses must distinguish between enemies and friends, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and unite closely on the basis of the thought of Mao Zedong, launching a fierce attack on the common enemy. In the revolutionary criticism, promote revolutionary unity; on the basis of revolutionary unity, achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and successfully complete the great historical task of one struggle, two criticisms, and three transformations.

The great thought of Mao Zedong is the most powerful ideological weapon for criticizing the bourgeoisie and revisionism. Only by holding high the great red banner of the thought of Mao Zedong and seriously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works can we overthrow, smash, and expose the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party and the small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and deeply, thoroughly, and completely criticize and expose their counter-revolutionary revisionist line!

It is advisable to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength, and it is not advisable to seek fame like King Xiang Yu.

Comrades of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, revolutionary comrades, let us, under the guidance of the great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of beating the fallen enemy, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, thoroughly bury the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and thoroughly defeat the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party!

Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    宜将剩勇追穷寇
    ——彻底埋葬旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团
    去年的今天，《前线》杂志和旧《北京日报》抛出了一批关于“三家村”和《燕山夜话》的材料，并且加了一个精心炮制的编者按语。这就是臭名昭著的假批判、真包庇，舍车马、保将帅的“四·一六”反革命政治大阴谋。
    这个反革命政治大阴谋的罪魁祸首，就是旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的头子以及背后支持他们的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。
    毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子和党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，正是这样的一批蠢人。他们耍弄阴谋诡计，妄图逃脱革命人民的惩罚，伺机东山再起。但是，历史是无情的。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万革命群众面前，他们可耻地失败了！
    一年来，我们英雄的祖国发生了天翻地覆的变化。无产阶级文化大革命的红色风暴，席卷全中国，震撼全世界！它摧毁了一个又一个反动的顽固堡垒，扫荡着旧社会遗留下来的一切残渣余孽，触及着每个人的灵魂。以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线遭到了惨败，并且正在节节惨败；以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了伟大的胜利，并且正在节节胜利。毛泽东思想正在更加广阔的范围内占领阵地。
    旧北京市委的反动统治被推翻了！
    旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的后台、党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派被揪出来了！
    十七年来，旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，一贯打着“红旗”反红旗，在政治、经济、思想文化等各个领域推行了一条彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义路线，向党向社会主义向毛泽东思想发动了猖狂的、全面的进攻。
    他们大肆污蔑我们伟大的领袖毛主席，恶毒攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席；狂热吹捧党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。
    他们十分害怕毛泽东思想，极端仇视毛泽东思想，疯狂反对毛泽东思想，千方百计地破坏活学活用毛主席著作的伟大群众运动；强行推销反毛泽东思想的大毒草《修养》。
    他们顽固地反对毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说，竭力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，贩卖党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所宣扬的“阶级合作”、“党内和平”的修正主义货色。
    他们和党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派狼狈为奸，反对无产阶级专政，实行资产阶级专政；对于抵制和反对他们的反革命修正主义统治的革命群众，威胁利诱，打击陷害，无所不用其极。
    他们反对突出无产阶级政治，拚命突出资产阶级政治，大力兜售党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的反革命经济主义，大搞物质刺激，实行业务挂帅、技术挂帅、钞票挂帅，妄图把广大人民群众引向资本主义、修正主义的泥坑。
    他们在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的纵容下，利用他们所把持的一切宣传工具，散布了大量封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的毒素，向党向社会主义向毛泽东思想射出了《海瑞罢官》、《燕山夜话》、《三家村札记》等大批毒箭，为颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义制度制造舆论。
    他们反对毛主席的无产阶级教育方针，极力推行党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所提出的修正主义教育方针，引导学生只“专”不红，脱离无产阶级政治，为他们复辟资本主义培养接班人。
    他们忠实执行党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的修正主义组织路线，招降纳叛，结党营私，四处网罗牛鬼蛇神，安插亲信，把北京市变成一个针插不进、水泼不进的“独立王国”。
    他们猖狂反对城乡社会主义教育运动，积极推行党内头号走资本主义道路当权派形“左”实右的机会主义路线，包庇党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和地、富、反、坏、右分子，残酷打击贫下中农和革命干部。
    他们在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，疯狂地破坏无产阶级文化大革命，抵制对《海瑞罢官》的批判，妄图把严重的政治斗争引向“纯学术”讨论的邪路，包庇资产阶级右派，围剿无产阶级左派，梦想扑灭毛主席亲自点燃起来的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。………
    旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，阴险毒辣，野心勃勃，坏事干尽，罪恶滔天！这是一伙钻进我们“肝脏”里来的敌人，是埋藏在毛主席身边的定时炸弹，是穷凶极恶的反革命政变集团，是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派阴谋篡党篡国的急先锋！
    旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的滔天罪行必须彻底清算！　　
    旧北京市委推行的反革命修正主义路线必须彻底批判！
    旧北京市委反革命修正主义的统治机器必须彻底打碎！
    旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子必须彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    无产阶级革命派同旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团之间的斗争，就是夺权斗争，就是资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争。
    彻底打倒旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，彻底肃清它的一切流毒和影响，这是关系到把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大事，是关系到巩固无产阶级专政的大事，是关系到我们党和国家前途、命运的大事，是关系到世界革命前途和命运的大事。
    当前，全国正在开展对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的群众性的革命大批判。彻底批判旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，是这个群众性的革命大批判的深入发展。我们一定要把对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的批判，同对旧北京市委反革命修正主义路线的批判以及本单位、本部门的斗、批、改任务密切地结合起来，把群众性的革命大批判推向一个新的高潮。
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”一九六六年《红旗》第十二期社论指出：“集中力量打击一小撮资产阶级右派分子，打击党内走资本主义道路的当权派，这是斗争的大方向。”无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，必须分清敌友，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，在毛泽东思想的基础上紧密地团结起来，向共同的敌人猛烈开火。在革命的大批判中，促进革命的大联合；在革命的大联合的基础上，实现革命的“三结合”，胜利完成一斗、二批、三改的伟大历史任务。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是批判资产阶级和修正主义的最强大的思想武器。只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真活学活用毛主席著作，才能把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，才能把他们的反革命修正主义路线批深、批透、批倒、批臭！
    宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。
    无产阶级革命派的战友们，革命的同志们，让我们在伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，发扬痛打“落水狗”的革命精神，彻底批判旧北京市委的反革命修正主义路线，彻底埋葬旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，彻底打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派！
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
                                          （四月十六日）
