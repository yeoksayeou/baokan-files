Firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line

Concentrate firepower to severely criticize the top capitalist-roaders within the Party

The culprits of the reactionary line cannot escape their crimes; it is futile to frame revolutionary youngsters

Eliminate the poison of "striking a large group and protecting a few"

Revolutionary masses and cadres in Qingdao expose the heinous crimes of the top capitalist-roader within the Party

New China News Agency, Jinan, April 17 — In a recent meeting to criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party, revolutionary cadres and Red Guards from various units in Qingdao expressed their determination to thoroughly and completely eradicate the reactionary line of "striking a large group and protecting a few." They vowed to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in every corner and unit of the city, and to achieve a complete victory in the Cultural Revolution.

A representative from the Dongfanghong Combat Team of the Qingdao Federation of Trade Unions said: As soon as the Cultural Revolution began, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Federation, in collusion with the work team sent by the Municipal Party Committee, stubbornly carried out the black directives of the top capitalist-roader within the Party. They directed the struggle against revolutionary cadres. They suppressed big-character posters exposing the crimes of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and under the guise of "eliminating the black line" and "digging up the black roots," they directed the struggle against ordinary cadres. Among nearly a hundred cadres, they listed thirty-two as "black elements," inciting a chaotic struggle among cadres. When revolutionary cadres joined forces with revolutionary students to counterattack, they labeled the revolutionary cadres as "traitors" and "counter-revolutionaries," maliciously slandering them as "colluding with rightist students" and "betraying the 300,000 workers of the city." These scoundrels not only hung "traitor" and "active counter-revolutionary" signs on six Communist Party members for struggle sessions but also listed more than twenty comrades who resisted the bourgeois reactionary line as "black elements," gathering a large amount of "black materials" against them. They even transferred the "black materials" of "key elements" out as evidence for "settling accounts later." The Federation of Trade Unions had a total of more than sixty people listed as "black roots," "black lines," "traitors," and "counter-revolutionaries" in two rounds, accounting for more than sixty percent of the entire staff. Thus, a white terror of "black clouds pressing down on the city" emerged for a time.

A representative from the revolutionary faction of the Qingdao Phosphatic Fertilizer Plant said: Last June, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party sent a work team to our plant to extinguish the flames of the Cultural Revolution. After the work team entered the plant, they first sorted all the cadres and staff into ranks and "sent them downstairs" one by one. Out of fifty cadres in the entire plant, sixty percent were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "degenerate elements," or "black gang" and "black line" figures; another twenty percent were "sidelined" or "awaiting verification for use." They particularly persecuted and brutally struggled against some leading cadres who had earlier supported the revolutionary mass movement. Some of these cadres were suspended from their posts, some were under review while working, some were prepared to be dismissed, expelled from the Party and the Youth League, and sent back home. The proletarian revolutionary faction of the plant, based on Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, firmly fought against the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large group and protecting a few," and at the same time did a lot of work to unite and educate cadres who had been temporarily deceived and made different degrees of mistakes, helping them return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Now, more than eighty percent of the middle-level cadres in the entire plant have stood up to revolutionize, and many revolutionary leading cadres have been invited to participate in the temporary power organs of the "three-in-one combination" at the factory and workshop levels.

A representative from the Revolutionary Committee of the Qingdao Grain Bureau said: A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party are now trying to frame the proletarian revolutionary faction with the crime of "knocking down all cadres." This is truly the thief crying "catch the thief." Since the Cultural Revolution began, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party have actively promoted the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large group and protecting a few" in our grain department. They divided our grain department cadres into "four categories," labeling them as "red cadres" and "black cadres," and saying that there is a small group of "red" and a large group of "black." Under their meticulous planning, more than seventy percent of the staff in the grain department were attacked and labeled with political hats such as "anti-Party elements," "counter-revolutionaries," "rightists," and "little Khrushchevs." The proletarian revolutionary faction of the grain department has long seen that this indiscriminate practice of knocking down all cadres is extremely reactionary. After seizing power, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, united the majority, struck down a small clique, welcomed revolutionary leading cadres to stand up to revolutionize, and encouraged deceived cadres to launch a "counterattack," making the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary faction unprecedentedly strong. The facts have proven that the proletarian revolutionary faction has always been loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and has always acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Anyone who tries to frame the revolutionary faction with the crime of knocking down all cadres is in vain. We must firmly hold high the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and struggle against the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line he represents.

Li Yanling, who once executed the bourgeois reactionary line as the former director of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee Office, said at the meeting: Due to my worldview not being well transformed, in leading the Cultural Revolution in the former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee Office, I stood on the bourgeois standpoint and actively implemented the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large group and protecting a few" promoted by the top capitalist-roader within the Party. I directed the struggle against the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. From mid-June to late July last year, our unit posted a total of 644 big-character posters, of which only one-fifth exposed the leaders of the office, and the rest were against revolutionary masses and ordinary cadres. Moreover, the content of the big-character posters was "scratching the itch through the shoe" for those above and "hitting the nail on the head" for those below. Under the direct instigation of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Municipal Party Committee, nearly half of the revolutionary cadres in the Municipal Party Committee Office were attacked, while a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party sat back and watched the fight. Obviously, the reason why the former Municipal Party Committee's small clique of capitalist-roaders wanted to actively promote the reactionary line of "striking a large group and protecting a few" in the office was that the revolutionary comrades in our office knew their true colors best. To protect themselves, they raised the black flag of "striking a large group" and deliberately muddied the waters to achieve the goal of sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. In the past, I had insufficient understanding and shallow feelings about the root and harm of this reactionary line. Through the criticism and education of comrades in the revolutionary faction of the office and especially the recent criticism of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, my ideological awareness has been raised, and I have come to recognize the evil of this reactionary line. I have realized that this reactionary line is the one formulated by the top capitalist-roader within the Party to sabotage the Cultural Revolution. I executed this reactionary line, both harming others and being harmed. I am determined to completely break with this bourgeois reactionary line, return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and closely unite with comrades in the proletarian revolutionary faction to fight side by side, thoroughly criticize, overthrow, and expose the top capitalist-roader within the Party, and make him fall to the ground and never rise again.

### 肃清“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的流毒

专栏：

    坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边
    集中火力狠批党内头号走资本主义道路当权派
    反动路线提出者的罪责难逃　给革命小将强加罪名枉费心机
    肃清“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的流毒
    青岛革命群众革命干部控诉党内头号走资本主义道路当权派滔天罪行
    新华社济南十七日电　青岛市无产阶级革命派在最近举行的一次批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大会上，各单位革命派代表、红卫兵小将和革命的领导干部，纷纷在会上揭发、控诉和批判在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行。他们一致表示：一定要在青岛市彻底、干净地挖掉这条反动路线，把以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线贯彻到全市的每个角落、每个单位中去，誓夺文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    青岛市总工会东方红战斗兵团的代表说：文化革命一开始，市总工会党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派伙同市委派来的工作组，顽固执行党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的黑指示，把斗争的矛头指向广大革命干部。他们扣压革命干部揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派罪行的大字报，同时以排“黑线”、挖“黑根”为名，把斗争矛头指向一般干部。他们在近百名干部中，排出三十二人上了黑名单，挑起干部斗干部的一场混战。当革命干部联合革命学生起来反击时，他们又把革命干部打成“叛徒”、“反革命”，恶毒地诬蔑革命干部“勾结右派学生”，“出卖了全市三十万工人阶级”。这些坏家伙不仅把六名共产党员挂上
  “叛徒”、“现行反革命分子”的黑牌子进行斗争，而且把二十多名抵制资产阶级反动路线的革命同志登上“黑账”，集中大量人员搜集、整理他们的“黑材料”。他们还把“重点分子”的“黑材料”转移出去，作为“秋后算账”的依据。市总工会前后两次被走资本主义道路当权派列入“黑根”、“黑线”、“叛徒”、“反革命”黑名单的共达六十多人，占机关全体干部的百分之六十以上。就这样，一时出现了“黑云压城城欲摧”的白色恐怖局面。
    青岛市磷肥厂的革命派代表在会上说：去年六月份，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派为了扑灭文化大革命的烈火，派工作组来到我厂。工作组进厂后，首先将全厂干部职工进行排队，逐个“下楼”。全厂共有干部五十人，百分之六十的干部被打成“反革命”、
  “蜕化变质分子”或“黑帮”、“黑线”人物；还有百分之二十的干部被“靠边站”或“待考验使用”。他们特别对一些较早起来支持革命群众运动的领导干部进行了种种迫害和残酷斗争。这些干部有的被停职，有的边检查、边劳动，有的准备罢官，开除党籍、团籍，遣返回家。厂里的无产阶级革命派根据毛主席的干部政策，同“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线进行了坚决的斗争，同时对一时受蒙蔽和犯过不同程度错误的干部进行大量团结和教育的工作，帮助他们回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。现在，全厂百分之八十以上的中层干部已经站起来革命，不少革命领导干部还分别被吸收参加工厂、车间“三结合”的临时权力机构。
    青岛市粮食局革命委员会的代表在会上说：党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，现在企图把对干部“打倒一切”的罪名强加在无产阶级革命派头上，这真是贼喊捉贼。文化大革命运动开展以来，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在我们粮食局积极推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。他们把我们粮食部门的干部分成“四等”，划分为“红干部”、“黑干部”，还说什么“红”的一小撮，“黑”的一大片。在他们的精心策划下，粮食部门有百分之七十以上的职工遭到围攻，被戴上“反党分子”、“反革命”、
  “右派分子”、“小赫鲁晓夫”等政治帽子。粮食部门的无产阶级革命派早就看到这种不分青红皂白，对干部打倒一切的做法是十分反动的。我们在夺权以后，遵循毛主席的教导，团结大多数，打击一小撮，欢迎革命的领导干部站起来革命，鼓励受蒙蔽的干部大杀“回马枪”，使无产阶级革命派队伍空前壮大。事实证明，无产阶级革命派一贯忠于毛泽东思想，一贯根据毛主席的教导办事，任何人要把对干部打倒一切的罪名强加在革命派头上，那是枉费心机。我们一定要高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线批倒斗臭。
    曾经一度执行过资产阶级反动路线的前青岛市委办公室主任李延令在会上说：由于我的世界观没有得到很好改造，在领导前青岛市委办公室的文化革命运动中，站在资产阶级的立场上，积极贯彻了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派推行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，把斗争矛头指向了广大革命群众和革命干部，从去年六月中旬到七月下旬，我们单位共贴出六百四十四张大字报，其中揭发办公室领导人的只有五分之一，其他都是针对革命群众和一般干部的大字报。而且大字报的内容，对上边是“隔靴搔痒”，对下边却是“一针见血”。在市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的直接唆使下，市委办公室将近半数的革命干部受到围攻，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派却坐山观虎斗。很显然，前市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派之所以要在办公室积极推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动路线，就是因为我们办公室的革命同志最了解他们的底细。为了保护他们自己，他们就擎起“打击一大片”这面黑旗，有意把水搅浑，达到破坏文化大革命的目的。过去我对于这条反动路线的根源和危害性，认识不足，体会不深。在文化大革命运动中，通过机关革命派同志的批判教育，特别是最近开展的对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的批判，使我提高了思想觉悟，认识到这条反动路线的罪恶，认识到这条反动路线就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为破坏文化大革命而制定出来的。我执行了这条反动路线，既是害人者，又是受害者。我决心同这条资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，同无产阶级革命派同志紧密团结起来，并肩战斗，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派彻底批透，斗垮，斗臭，把他打翻在地，叫他永世不得翻身。
