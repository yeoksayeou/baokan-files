The capital's revolutionary masses today held a large-scale demonstration and march, angrily denouncing the new crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries against China and Chinese people.

Workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres from all directions surged towards the gate of the Indonesian Embassy in China, angrily exposing the bloody crimes of the Indonesian reactionary government.

Ning Baohui and his wife Hong Yufen, sons of Ning Xiangyu who was brutally persecuted by the Indonesian reactionaries, came to the gate of the Indonesian Embassy in China this afternoon. In front of the acting charge d'affaires of the Indonesian Embassy in China, Baren, they angrily denounced the fascist atrocities committed by the Indonesian reactionary government against their father. Ning Baohui said: I want to angrily denounce and condemn the fascist crimes committed by your Indonesian right-wing reactionary government against my father, Ning Xiangyu, and strongly protest against them. Ning Baohui angrily pointed out that the Indonesian reactionaries thought they could suppress the just struggle of our compatriots to defend their legitimate rights with guns and butcher knives, which is absolutely impossible. My father may have fallen, but the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia will never yield. Their just struggle to defend the dignity of the motherland and the legitimate rights of overseas Chinese is not isolated. Chairman Mao's socialist New China is the strongest support for overseas Chinese, and the 700 million people of the motherland are the strongest backing for overseas Chinese. The broad masses of the Indonesian people are reliable friends of overseas Chinese. The Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese activities will only result in "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet."

Many workers who just got off work also rushed to join the demonstration and march. They warned the Indonesian reactionary government: You must stop at the precipice and immediately stop all anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. Otherwise, you will not have a good ending. Revolutionary students and Red Guards from dozens of universities and colleges in the capital, such as Peking University, Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law, Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, and Renmin University of China, handed over a large number of protest letters to the Indonesian Embassy in China, severely condemning the fascist atrocities of the Suharto-Nasution reactionary regime, and expressed their resolute support for the just struggle of Indonesian overseas Chinese. The revolutionary faction of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's protest letter to the Indonesian Embassy in China pointed out that the Indonesian reactionary government is a thorough fascist regime, and they have done all kinds of evil things. We must expose and denounce their heinous crimes to the people of the world.

More than 200 returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia shouted in Indonesian in front of the gate of the Indonesian Embassy in China: We firmly support the just struggle of patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia against persecution. The 700 million people of China are the strong backing of overseas Chinese! They also sang the song of Chairman Mao's quotations in unison: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic."

Some Indonesian students studying in China also came to the gate of the Indonesian Embassy in China to protest and demonstrate today. They pasted large-character posters on the wall of the embassy: "Down with the running dog of American imperialism, Nasution!" "Down with Suharto!" "Mao Zedong Thought is the guarantee for the victory of the Indonesian people's revolution!" "The Indonesian people have boundless love for Chairman Mao!" In the protest letter read by the representative of the Federation of Indonesian Students in China, Sharmadi, it said: We revolutionary Indonesian students studying in China strongly protest against the savage white terror imposed by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime on the Indonesian people and patriotic revolutionary overseas Chinese. The Indonesian people and the Chinese people will never forgive you. The internationalist duty of the Indonesian people is to firmly support the just struggle of patriotic overseas Chinese and to stand firmly with them. We support the Chinese government's announcement that Baren and Sumarno are unwelcome persons.

    首都革命群众的抗议怒潮冲向印尼大使馆
    印尼反动政府决没有好下场
    据新华社二十六日讯　首都革命群众今天举行更大规模的示威游行，愤怒声讨印尼反动派反华排华的新罪行。
    革命工人、农民、红卫兵小将、革命师生和革命干部的游行队伍，从四面八方涌向印尼驻华大使馆门前，愤怒地控诉印尼反动政府的血腥罪行。
    受印尼反动派残酷迫害的华侨老人宁祥雨的儿子宁宝辉、儿媳宏玉芬，今天下午来到印尼驻华大使馆门前，当着印尼驻华大使馆临时代办巴伦的面愤怒控诉了印尼反动政府残害他们父亲的法西斯暴行。宁宝辉说：我要愤怒控诉和声讨你们印尼右派反动政府残害我父亲宁祥雨的法西斯罪行，并且提出最最强烈的抗议。宁宝辉愤怒地指出，印尼反动派妄想用枪口和屠刀来压服我国侨胞为维护他们正当的权益而展开的正义斗争，这是绝对办不到的。我父亲虽然倒下了，但是，印尼广大爱国华侨是绝不会屈服的，他们为维护祖国的尊严和侨胞的正当权益而进行的自卫正义斗争，绝不是孤立的。毛主席领导的社会主义新中国，是华侨最有力的靠山，祖国七亿人民是华侨最坚强的后盾，广大印尼人民是华侨可靠的朋友。印尼反动政府反华排华，其结果只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
    许多刚下班的工人也赶来参加示威游行。他们警告印尼反动政府：必须悬崖勒马，立即停止一切反华排华活动。否则是绝不会有好下场的。北京大学、北京政法学院、北京邮电学院、中国人民大学等几十所首都高等院校和中等学校的革命师生和红卫兵小将，向印尼驻华大使馆递交了大批抗议信，严厉谴责苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动当局的法西斯暴行，表示坚决支持印尼华侨的正义斗争。华侨事务委员会革命派给印尼驻华大使馆的抗议书中指出，印尼反动政府是地地道道的法西斯政权，他们做尽坏事，我们要向全世界人民揭露和控诉他们的滔天罪行。
    二百多名印尼归国华侨在印尼驻华大使馆门前，用印尼语愤怒地高喊：我们坚决支持印尼爱国华侨反迫害的正义斗争。七亿中国人民是华侨的强大后盾！他们还齐声高唱毛主席语录歌：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    一些印尼在华留学生今天也来到印尼驻华大使馆门前抗议示威。他们在大使馆的墙上贴出了大字标语：“打倒美帝国主义走狗纳苏蒂安！”“打倒苏哈托！”“毛泽东思想是引导印尼人民革命胜利的保证！”“印尼人民无限热爱毛主席！”印尼在华学生联合会代表沙尔玛迪在宣读的抗议书里说：我们革命的印尼留华学生最强烈地抗议苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权对印尼人民、爱国的革命华侨实行野蛮的白色恐怖。印尼人民和中国人民决不会饶恕你们。印尼人民的国际主义义务是坚决支持爱国华侨的正义斗争，并坚决和他们站在一起。我们支持中国政府宣布巴伦、苏玛尔诺为不受欢迎的人。
