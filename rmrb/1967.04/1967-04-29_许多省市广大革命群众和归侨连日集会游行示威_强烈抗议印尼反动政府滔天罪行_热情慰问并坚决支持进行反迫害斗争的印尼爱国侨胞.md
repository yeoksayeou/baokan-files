	Many provinces and cities across the country have seen revolutionary masses and returned overseas Chinese holding rallies and demonstrations in recent days. They strongly protest the heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionary government and express solidarity with Indonesian patriotic overseas Chinese fighting against persecution.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 28th, in recent days, revolutionary people and returned overseas Chinese from many provinces and cities across the country have held rallies and demonstrations to strongly condemn the Indonesian reactionary government's mad persecution of overseas Chinese and its actions to sabotage relations between the two countries. The demonstrators emphasized that the Indonesian reactionaries' mad anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese actions will not end well. The dark clouds currently hanging over the heads of the Indonesian people and overseas Chinese will surely pass, and the day of the downfall of the Indonesian reactionaries will surely come. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "When dark clouds appear in the sky, we point out: this is only a temporary phenomenon, darkness will soon pass, and dawn is just ahead."

	Revolutionary masses from all over the country have unanimously expressed their firm support for the statement issued by our government on April 26, and have expressed their warmest sympathies and most resolute support to the Indonesian patriotic overseas Chinese who are fighting against persecution.

	Revolutionary masses from Guangdong and Guangxi, who have been closely following the struggles of Indonesian overseas Chinese, have expressed the strongest protests against the Indonesian reactionary government's unbridled anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese actions. On the 27th and 28th, hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses from all walks of life in Guangzhou held rallies and demonstrations. Revolutionary workers of the proletariat said that the recent series of serious incidents deliberately created by the Indonesian reactionary authorities are serious provocations by the Indonesian reactionaries against the Chinese people and are major steps by the Indonesian reactionary authorities to further sabotage relations between the two countries. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their final struggles against the revolutionary forces." The Indonesian reactionaries' mad anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese actions mean that their days of doom are not far off. Nearly a thousand overseas Chinese students who have returned from Indonesia participated in the denunciation meeting and demonstration, filled with hatred for the Indonesian reactionaries. Overseas Chinese, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, and some foreign friends who are participating in the China Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou also participated in the demonstration.

	In recent days, more than 20,000 people in Nanning have participated in denunciation rallies and demonstrations. Representatives of returned overseas Chinese, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres at the meeting expressed their firm support for the just struggle of Indonesian overseas Chinese under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and vowed to be a strong backing for Indonesian overseas Chinese.

	The heroic fighting collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought—41 overseas Chinese youth—most resolutely support the statement of our government and strongly condemn the anti-China atrocities of the Suharto-Nasution reactionary clique in Indonesia.

	In Shanghai, Harbin, Taiyuan, Guiyang, Qingdao, and other cities, revolutionary masses have held protest rallies and demonstrations in recent days. Today, 800,000 revolutionary masses and proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai held a denunciation rally. The meeting solemnly warned the Indonesian reactionaries: you are acting as the anti-China henchmen of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism and will not end well. Ten million revolutionary people of Shanghai, together with the people of the whole country, vow to be a powerful backing for the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese and firmly believe that the final victory will belong to the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people. The representative of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee at the meeting severely condemned the anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese atrocities of the Indonesian reactionary government.

	The representative of returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia at the meeting exposed the various persecutions inflicted on large numbers of overseas Chinese by the Suharto-Nasution reactionary clique, which was nurtured by U.S. imperialism, after the counter-revolutionary coup in 1965. She expressed her firm belief that the revolutionary people of Indonesia will surely rise up to overthrow the Indonesian reactionary government. Representatives of Shanghai workers, advanced workers, Red Guards, and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations spoke one after another at the meeting, strongly condemning the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionaries. The meeting sent a telegram to Indonesian patriotic overseas Chinese expressing sympathy. After the meeting, a grand demonstration was held.

	On the 27th, 200,000 people from all walks of life in Harbin held a denunciation meeting. A worker representative in his speech pointed out that although the anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese activities of the Indonesian reactionary government are rampant for the time being, they will not escape the law pointed out by Chairman Mao: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause," and the doom of annihilation is awaiting the Indonesian reactionaries. Yesterday, more than 10,000 proletarian revolutionary fighters in Taiyuan held a protest rally. Member of the core group of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi and deputy chairman of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, Yuan Zhen, warned the Indonesian reactionary authorities in his speech: your vicious persecution of revolutionary people and overseas Chinese is in vain, the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. The meeting was filled with a high fighting spirit from beginning to end. After the meeting, people held a powerful demonstration. Nearly 100,000 revolutionary fighters of the proletariat of all ethnic groups and Red Guard revolutionary youngsters in Guiyang held a large-scale rally and demonstration yesterday.

	In recent days, Changchun, Shenyang, Xining, Lhasa, Urumqi, and other cities have also held denunciation rallies and demonstrations.

    据新华社二十八日讯　全国许多省、市的革命人民和归国侨胞，最近几天纷纷举行集会和示威游行，愤怒声讨印尼反动政府疯狂迫害华侨，破坏两国关系的滔天罪行。示威的人们强调指出，印尼反动派疯狂反华排华，绝不会有好下场，目前笼罩在印尼人民和华侨头上的乌云终将过去，印尼反动派垮台的日子必将到来。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“当着天空中出现乌云的时候，我们就指出：这不过是暂时的现象，黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头。”
    各地革命群众一致表示坚决拥护我国政府四月二十六日的声明，并且向正在进行反迫害斗争的印尼爱国华侨表示热情的慰问和最坚决的支持。
    密切关注着印尼华侨斗争的广东、广西的革命群众，对印尼反动政府肆无忌惮地进行反华排华，提出最最强烈的抗议。广州市各界广大革命群众二十七日和二十八日举行了数十万人的集会和游行示威。无产阶级革命派工人们说，印尼反动当局最近蓄意制造的一系列严重事件，是印尼反动派对中国人民的严重挑衅，是印尼反动当局进一步破坏两国关系的重大步骤。毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。印尼反动派疯狂反华排华，它们离灭亡的日子也就不远了。近千名从印尼归国的华侨学生，怀着对印尼反动派不共戴天的仇恨，参加了声讨大会和示威游行。正在广州参加中国出口商品交易会的爱国华侨、港澳同胞和一部分外国朋友，今天也参加了示威游行。
    南宁市的革命群众这几天参加声讨集会和示威游行的有两万多人。印尼归侨代表、革命工人和革命干部代表在会上表示，坚决支持印尼华侨高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗所进行的正义斗争，誓作印尼华侨的坚强后盾。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄战斗集体——四十一名华侨青少年，最坚决地拥护我国政府的声明，强烈谴责以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼反动派的反华暴行。
    在上海、哈尔滨、太原、贵阳、青岛等城市，广大革命群众这几天来纷纷举行抗议集会和示威游行。上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众八万人今天举行了声讨集会。大会严正警告印尼反动派：你们充当美帝苏修的反华打手，决不会有好下场。一千万上海革命人民和全国人民一起，誓作广大爱国侨胞的强大后盾，坚信最后胜利一定属于广大爱国侨胞和印尼人民。上海市革命委员会代表在会上严厉谴责印尼反动政府的反华排华暴行。
    印尼归国华侨代表在会上揭露了由美帝豢养的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动集团在一九六五年反革命政变以后对大批华侨进行的种种迫害。她表示坚信，革命的印尼人民，一定会起来打倒印尼反动政府。上海市工人代表、先进工作者代表、红卫兵代表，以及革命群众组织代表等先后在会上讲话，强烈谴责印尼反动派的法西斯暴行。大会致电印尼爱国华侨表示慰问。大会结束后，举行了声势浩大的示威游行。
    哈尔滨市各界革命群众二十万人二十七日举行了声讨大会。工人代表在讲话中指出，印尼反动政府的反华排华活动尽管猖獗一时，但它决逃不脱毛主席指出的“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑”这个规律，最后灭亡的命运正在等待着印尼反动派。太原市无产阶级革命派战士一万多人昨天举行了抗议集会。中共山西核心小组成员、山西省革命委员会副主任袁振在会上讲话时，严正警告印尼反动当局说：你们对革命人民、对华侨穷凶极恶地迫害，完全是徒劳的，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民决不是好惹的。大会自始至终充满了高昂的战斗气氛。会后人们举行了强大的示威游行。贵阳市各族无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将近十万人，昨天举行大规模的集会和示威游行。
    长春、沈阳、西宁、拉萨、乌鲁木齐等城市这几天都举行了声讨集会和示威游行。
