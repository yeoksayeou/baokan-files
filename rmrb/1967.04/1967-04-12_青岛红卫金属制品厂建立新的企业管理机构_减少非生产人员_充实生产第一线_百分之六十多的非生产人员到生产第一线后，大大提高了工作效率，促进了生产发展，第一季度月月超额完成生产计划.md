Qingdao Red Guard Metal Products Factory Establishes New Enterprise Management Structure

Reduces Non-Production Personnel, Reinforces Production Front Line

Over 60% of Non-Production Personnel Moved to Production Front Line, Significantly Improving Work Efficiency and Promoting Production Development; First Quarter Sees Monthly Exceedance of Production Plans

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power at Qingdao Red Guard Metal Products Factory, they changed the old enterprise management structure and established a new management system that is conducive to both revolution and production. Over 60% of non-production personnel were transferred to the production front line, significantly improving work efficiency and promoting production development.

Currently, the management structure of this nearly 500-person factory has been changed from the original "three-level-one-leader" and "six-departments-one-office" to two service groups under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee: one is the political service group, responsible for propaganda, security, organization, and other political and ideological work; the other is the production service group, responsible for technical, labor protection, cost, material management, and planning statistics work that serve the shop floor production. Non-production personnel have been reduced from the original 44 to 15, with the surplus personnel transferred to the production front line. In the two months since the establishment of this new enterprise management structure, the focus has been on politics, facing production and the masses, and serving production wholeheartedly. This has effectively promoted production development. The entire factory has exceeded the state plan month by month in the first quarter, with product quality improved and costs significantly reduced.

Previously, this factory's management system had long followed a capitalist and revisionist approach. Management personnel accounted for about 9% of the total workforce, with a bloated structure, overlapping levels, overly detailed divisions, lax management, and mutual passing of the buck, resulting in very low work efficiency. More seriously, it did not emphasize politics, did not trust the masses, and relied heavily on administrative orders and regulations to manage workers, severely constraining the production enthusiasm of revolutionary masses.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory united and, on January 22, seized power from the capitalist-roaders within the party. They immediately mobilized the masses to begin reforming the management structure. Initially, some workers had concerns; some doubted whether the new structure could complete the tasks, and others, driven by personal interests, felt that being demoted was not honorable. In response to these thoughts, the factory revolutionary committee mobilized the revolutionary workers to study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind. Those who doubted the new things learned from Chairman Mao's teachings: "Any new thing in its growth inevitably experiences twists and turns. In socialist construction, to think that one can achieve success without going through twists and turns, without paying tremendous efforts, and without encountering difficulties, is merely a fantasy." They realized that the development of new things has a process and that one must not fear difficulties and forge a path to manage the enterprise through practical struggle. Some officials with personal interests also learned from Chairman Mao's teachings: "All our work personnel, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people. What bad things do we have that we are reluctant to give up?" They examined their thoughts, realized that revolutionary work only has different divisions, not high and low status, and should use the standard of serving the people wholeheartedly to demand of themselves and go to the production front line. They removed the "self" from their minds and happily took up their new posts.

    青岛红卫金属制品厂建立新的企业管理机构
    减少非生产人员  充实生产第一线
    百分之六十多的非生产人员到生产第一线后，大大提高了工作效率，促进了生产发展，第一季度月月超额完成生产计划
    据新华社济南电　青岛红卫金属制品厂的无产阶级革命派掌权以后改变旧的企业管理机构，建立了有利于抓革命、促生产的新的管理体制，使百分之六十多的非生产人员充实到生产第一线，大大提高了工作效率，促进了生产的发展。
    现在，这个近五百人的工厂的管理机构，已由原来的“三级一长”、“六科一室”，改为在工厂革命委员会领导下设两个服务组：一个是政治服务组，主管宣传、保卫、组织等政治思想工作；一个是生产服务组，主管为车间生产服务的技术、劳动保护、成本、物资保管、计划统计等工作。脱离生产的工作人员由原来的四十四人减少到十五人，精简出来的人充实到生产第一线。这个新的企业管理机构成立两个月来，突出政治，面向生产，面向群众，全心全意为生产服务，有力地促进了生产的发展。全厂第一季度月月超额完成国家计划，产品质量有所提高，成本显著降低。
    过去，这个工厂的管理体制一直沿用资本主义和修正主义的一套。管理干部占职工总数的百分之九左右，机构庞大，层次重叠，分工过细，管理松弛，遇事互相推托，工作效率很低。更严重的是不突出政治，不相信群众，干部多靠行政命令和规章制度来管理工人，严重地束缚了革命群众的生产积极性。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派联合起来，在一月二十二日夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权以后，立即发动群众，着手进行机构改革。开始的时候，有些职工有顾虑，有的对新的机构能否完成任务抱怀疑态度，还有的从私字出发，觉得自己被精简下去不光采。针对这些思想，工厂革命委员会就发动广大革命职工，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作。那些对新生事物抱怀疑态度的人，学习了毛主席的“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想”的教导，认识到新生事物的发展有一个过程，一定要不怕困难，在实践斗争中闯出一条自己管理企业的路子来。一些有私心杂念的干部也学习了毛主席的教导：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”他们对照自己的思想，认识到革命工作只有分工不同，没有高低贵贱之分，应该用全心全意为人民服务的标准要求自己，到生产第一线去。他们破除了脑子里的“私”字，愉快地走上新的工作岗位。
