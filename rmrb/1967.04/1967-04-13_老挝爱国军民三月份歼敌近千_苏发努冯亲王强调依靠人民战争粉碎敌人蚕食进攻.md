Lao patriotic military and civilians, in the battles against the enemy's "sweeping" and nibbling attacks in March this year, achieved great victories, killing nearly a thousand enemies and seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

The American bandits and their lackeys, in order to realize their plot of nibbling away at the liberated areas and slaughtering the people, dispatched many troops in March to conduct numerous savage "sweeping" operations in various provinces of Laos, especially in the provinces of Saravane and Luang Prabang. Wherever they went, they burned, killed, and looted, committing all sorts of atrocities, causing serious losses to the people's lives and property. Even more serious was that American imperialism dispatched planes to drop chemical poisons in the provinces of Xam Neua and Saravane, destroying villages and crops.

The savage acts of American imperialism and its lackeys have aroused the deep hatred of the Lao patriotic military and civilians. To defend the liberated areas and protect the people's lives and property, the military and civilians in various places have bravely fought back, foiling the enemy's numerous "sweeping" operations and attacks, and achieving the glorious victory of killing nearly a thousand enemies.

	According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on March 21, the American imperialists and their Lao lackeys dispatched a right-wing army camp to launch a savage "sweeping" operation in the Ban Nakho area, 32 kilometers south of Mangsey town in Vientiane Province. The local patriotic military and civilians, filled with deep hatred for the enemy, bravely fought back and achieved victory in the anti-"sweeping" battle. In this battle, the patriotic military and civilians killed 64 enemies, including 34 killed and 30 wounded. The remaining enemies fled in disarray.

	According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on March 5, the patriotic military and civilians of Xieng Khouang Province bravely foiled the enemy's multiple attacks in March, killing 173 enemies.

	According to another broadcast, the local forces and guerrilla units of Savannakhet Province, with the help of the local masses, attacked the enemy stationed in Thakhek County on March 25, killing 30 enemies, including one American soldier and one Thai officer.

According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, Suphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Vice Premier of the Lao Three-Party National Unity Government, said in a cadres' meeting in Xieng Khouang Province on March 2 that the Lao military and civilians had achieved a series of victories from the northern to the southern battlefields during the dry season, putting the enemy in a passive and helpless position both militarily and politically.

Suphanouvong said, "Our various patriotic armed forces, relying on the thriving people's war movement, have annihilated the enemy in multiple battles, deeply struck the enemy in the rear, attacked the enemy's command posts and airfields, and foiled the enemy's multiple nibbling attacks." He said, "What is particularly noteworthy is that our various patriotic armed forces have made a lot of progress in terms of ideology, tactics, technology, organization, and command."

    苏发努冯亲王强调依靠人民战争粉碎敌人蚕食进攻
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台七日广播，老挝爱国军民，在今年三月份反击敌人“扫荡”和蚕食进攻的战斗中，取得巨大胜利，共消灭敌人近一千名，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    美国强盗及其走狗为了实现蚕食解放区和屠杀人民的阴谋，在三月份出动许多军队，对老挝各省，尤其是对沙拉湾和琅勃拉邦两个省进行多次的疯狂
  “扫荡”。它们所到之处，烧杀抢掠，无恶不作，使人民的生命和财产遭到严重的损失。更为严重的是，美帝国主义还派遣飞机，在甘蒙和沙拉湾等省撒放化学毒药，摧毁村庄，破坏庄稼。
    美帝国主义及其走狗的这种野蛮行径，激起了老挝爱国军民对它们的刻骨仇恨。为了保卫解放区，保卫人民生命财产，各地军民进行了英勇的自卫战，粉碎了敌人的各次“扫荡”和进攻，取得了歼敌近千名的辉煌胜利。
    新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台广播：美帝国主义及其老挝走狗三月二十一日出动右派军队一个营，对离万象省芒塞镇南部三十二公里的班纳科地区发动野蛮的“扫荡”。当地爱国军民怀着对敌人的深仇大恨，英勇回击，取得反“扫荡”胜利。爱国军民在这次战斗中共消灭敌人六十四名，其中打死三十四名，打伤三十名。余敌狼狈逃窜。
    新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台五日广播：老挝桑怒省爱国军民，在三月间英勇地粉碎了敌人的多次进攻，共消灭敌人一百七十三名。
    另据广播：老挝沙湾拿吉省地方部队和游击队，在当地群众的帮助下于三月二十五日袭击驻守在同兴县的敌人，消灭敌人三十名，其中有一名美军和一名泰国军官。
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席、老挝三方民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王，二日在桑怒省的一次干部会议上谈到老挝局势时说：老挝军民在旱季中从上寮到下寮的各个战场上取得了一系列的胜利，使得敌人在军事上和政治上陷于被动和一筹莫展。
    苏发努冯说：“我们的各种爱国武装力量，依靠正在蓬勃发展的人民战争运动，在多次战斗中全歼敌人，深入敌后打击敌人，袭击敌人的指挥所和机场，粉碎了敌人的多次蚕食进攻。”他说：“特别值得注意的一点是，我们的各种爱国武装力量在思想、战术、技术、组织和指挥等方面都有了很多进步。”
