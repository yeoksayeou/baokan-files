According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 16th: New York: Nearly 400,000 Americans on the 15th held unprecedented large-scale demonstrations and rallies in New York and San Francisco against the U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

In New York, nearly 300,000 people participated in the afternoon's approximately five-hour march and demonstration, followed by a protest rally in front of the United Nations headquarters. This was the largest anti-war demonstration in the history of New York City.

The demonstrators began gathering in Central Park from all directions early in the morning. Many people traveled by car, train, or on foot from large and small cities in the East, such as Cleveland, Detroit, and Washington, to participate in the demonstration in New York.

Just before the demonstration began, over a hundred young people held an open ceremony in Central Park to burn their draft cards, showing their determination to go to jail rather than be drafted to fight in South Vietnam. As the young people, despite the surveillance of numerous plainclothes agents, bravely threw their draft cards into the burning fire, the surrounding crowd applauded enthusiastically.

At noon, the demonstration began to move out of Central Park. They marched in rows of ten or more, holding hands as they advanced. The demonstration included workers, shop assistants, students, professors, and clergy; young people, elderly, and mothers pushing strollers or holding children. The demonstration also included dozens of Native Americans dressed in traditional attire. These Native Americans, who have long been discriminated against and oppressed by American white rulers, left their so-called "Indian reservations" to join the fight against U.S. aggression in Vietnam for the first time. The demonstrators waved countless flags and banners with slogans such as "End the war in Vietnam immediately!" and "The bosses get rich, the soldiers die!"

A demonstration led mainly by African Americans set off from Harlem and merged with the main group en route. The front of the queue was a large flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fluttering in the wind. The African American demonstrators held signs with slogans such as "African Americans should fight against white racists, not against the freedom fighters of Vietnam!" and "No Vietnamese person has ever called me a nigger!" A group of Puerto Rican residents from Harlem also joined the demonstration with signs reading "Puerto Ricans will not go to Vietnam!"

Along the eight-kilometer-long streets where the parade passed, the sidewalks were filled with spectators. They welcomed the passing demonstrators with enthusiastic applause.

The New York authorities were terrified of this unprecedented large-scale demonstration and deployed thousands of police and mounted police along the parade route to "maintain order." Additionally, a large number of plainclothes agents were sent into the parade to monitor the situation.

On the same day, about 100,000 demonstrators from various cities on the West Coast gathered in San Francisco to hold a grand demonstration and rally, the largest of its kind the city had ever seen. Despite the heavy rain early in the morning and intermittent showers during the parade, it did not dampen the spirits and determination of the demonstrators.

    反对约翰逊政府侵略越南　拒绝为美国垄断资本卖命
    美国四十万人在纽约旧金山举行大示威
    黑人、印第安人和波多黎各人参加示威　反动当局调集数千警察进行监视
    据新华社十六日讯  纽约消息：将近四十万美国人十五日分别在纽约和旧金山举行空前规模的反对美国侵越战争的示威和集会。
    在纽约，有近三十万人参加了这天下午历时约五小时的游行示威，随后并在联合国总部门前举行了抗议集会。这是纽约市历史上一次空前规模的反对侵略战争的示威。
    示威者一清早就从四面八方向中央公园汇集。许多人是乘坐汽车、火车或徒步，由克利夫兰、底特律、华盛顿等东部大小城市赶来纽约参加示威的。
    在示威游行开始前不久，一百多名青年在中央公园里举行了公开焚毁征兵证的仪式，以表明他们宁愿坐牢也决不应征去南越充当炮灰的决心。当青年们不顾大批便衣特务的监视，毅然把征兵证投入熊熊燃烧的火堆时，周围的群众报以热烈的掌声。
    正午时分，示威队伍开始由中央公园出发，他们排成十多人一排，手挽手地前进。示威行列中有工人、店员、学生、教授以及教会人士；有青年，老人，也有推着婴儿车或牵着孩子的母亲。示威队伍中还有数十名身穿民族服装的印第安人。这些备遭美国白人统治者歧视和压迫的印第安人，走出圈囿他们的所谓“印第安人保留地”，投入到反对美国侵略越南的斗争中去，这还是第一次。示威群众挥舞着无数面旗帜和标语牌，上面写着：“立即结束在越南的战争！”“大老板发财，士兵送命！”等口号。
    一支主要由黑人群众组成的示威队伍从哈莱姆区出发，中途与大队汇合。队伍的前导是一面迎风招展的越南南方民族解放阵线的大旗。黑人示威者举着的标语牌上写着：“黑人应该同白人种族主义者作战，不应该同越南的自由战士作战！”“没有一个越南人叫过我黑鬼！”等口号。哈莱姆区一批波多黎各居民也打着“波多黎各人决不去越南！”的标语牌参加了示威的行列。
    在游行队伍经过的长达八公里的马路两旁人行道上，挤满了观看游行的群众。他们用一阵阵热烈的掌声来欢迎走过的示威队伍。
    纽约当局对这次空前规模的群众示威怕得要死，调集了数千名警察和骑警分布在游行队伍两旁“维持秩序”。另外还出动大批便衣特务混到游行队伍中进行监视。
    同一天，来自美国西海岸一些城市的大约十万名示威群众，聚集到旧金山，举行了盛大的示威和集会，规模之大也是这个城市前所未见的。尽管当天一早下了暴雨，随后在游行途中又几次下了小阵雨，但是并没有影响示威群众的情绪和决心。
