Progressives in Britain and Africa in London hail the 40th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's epoch-making work "Hunan Peasant Movement Survey Report"
All revolutionaries must support and lead the masses' revolutionary movements
The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America must overthrow imperialist rule with revolutionary violence

LONDON, April 31 (Xinhua) — On the 40th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's epoch-making work "Hunan Peasant Movement Survey Report," British and African progressives in London have issued statements highly praising the brilliant thoughts embodied in this work.

A British worker from Coventry, Henderson Brooks, told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, "All revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists should welcome, support, and lead every genuine uprising and mass revolutionary movement of the people. The attitude one takes toward such movements is the criterion for judging whether one is truly progressive, a genuine revolutionary, and a Marxist-Leninist."

The worker enthusiastically said, "Chairman Mao has always supported the exploited and oppressed people and has always defended the cause of the oppressed people who are determined to make revolution."

He said, "When the reactionaries said that the Hunan peasant movement was 'terrible,' Comrade Mao Zedong said, 'Excellent!'"

Brooks stressed, "Today, the reactionaries, imperialists, and modern revisionists in various countries are the same." "Regarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China, they say, 'terrible!' We revolutionary workers say, 'excellent!' Some waverers say, 'it's too much.' We Marxist-Leninists say: Go ahead, the revolutionary workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards of China. Not only are you strengthening yourselves, but you are also helping us, the exploited and oppressed workers in capitalist countries. You are true internationalists of the proletariat. You are fighting for the victory of proletarian ideology over bourgeois ideology and for revolutionary culture to replace bourgeois 'culture.' You are acting in the spirit of the greatest Marxist-Leninist, the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong."

Brooks concluded his speech by quoting a famous saying of Chairman Mao: "The thousand and one truths of Marxism boil down to one: 'Rebellion is justified.'" He warmly congratulated the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

He shouted:

"Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live Chairman Mao!"

British friends Pan Kulin and Pan Wei said, "On the 40th anniversary of the publication of the 'Hunan Peasant Movement Survey Report,' people in various parts of Britain are increasingly studying Mao Zedong Thought. 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is a bestseller. More and more people are realizing that Chairman Mao is the leader of all the people of the world who seek liberation."

Pan Kulin also said, "Although the specific situation in Britain today is different from that in China in 1927, the basic principles elucidated by Chairman Mao are still applicable and easily understood by ordinary people." He said, "For us today, Chairman Mao's analysis is both inspiring and a guide." "Fighting Marxist-Leninists are determined to act according to Mao Zedong's teachings."

The deputy representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania in London, Ibrahim, said, "Although this report was presented by Chairman Mao 40 years ago, it still has great guiding significance for all Marxist-Leninists today."

He stressed, "Chairman Mao's 'Hunan Peasant Movement Survey Report' should be a guide for all true Marxist-Leninists."

Ibrahim said, "For us African revolutionaries, this report is a valuable article."

He said, "Imperialism and old and new colonialism have relied on reactionary violence to rise to power and now rely on reactionary violence to maintain their rule. Therefore, they must be overthrown by revolutionary violence. In this report, Chairman Mao correctly points out: 'If the peasants do not use great force, they will never be able to overthrow the deeply rooted power of the landlords for thousands of years.' The struggle of the peasants in Africa, Asia, and Latin America against imperialism and old and new colonialism is exactly the same."

    在伦敦的英国和非洲进步人士欢呼《湖南农民运动考察报告》发表四十周年
    一切革命者必须支持并领导群众的革命运动
    亚非拉人民要用革命暴力推翻帝国主义统治
    新华社伦敦三十一日电　在毛主席的具有伟大历史意义的著作《湖南农民运动考察报告》发表四十周年之际，这里的英国和非洲进步人士发表谈话，高度赞扬这篇著作中所体现的毛主席的光辉思想。
    考文垂的一位英国工人亨德森·布鲁克斯对新华社记者说：“所有革命者和马克思列宁主义者，都应该欢迎、支持并领导人民的每一个真正的造反行动和每一个群众革命运动。对这种运动采取什么态度，是衡量一个人是否真正进步，是否一个真正的革命者和马克思列宁主义者的标准。”
    这位工人热情地说：“毛主席始终支持被剥削和被压迫的人民，始终维护坚决闹革命的被压迫的人民的事业。”
    他说：“当反动派说湖南农民运动‘糟得很’的时候，毛泽东同志就说：‘好得很’。”
    布鲁克斯强调说：“今天，各国反动派、帝国主义者和现代修正主义者也是如此”。“对于中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，他们说：‘糟得很！’我们革命工人则说：‘好得很！’一些动摇者说：‘太过分了。’我们马克思列宁主义者则说：中国革命的工农兵和红卫兵干下去吧。你们不仅壮大了自己，而且也帮助了我们这些资本主义国家的被剥削、被压迫的工人。你们是真正的无产阶级国际主义者……。你们正在为无产阶级思想战胜资产阶级思想，为用革命的文化代替资产阶级的‘文化’而战斗。”“你们是本着最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、伟大领袖毛泽东同志的精神在办事。”
    布鲁克斯在结束他的讲话时引用了毛主席的一段著名语录：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”他热烈祝贺中国的无产阶级文化大革命取得完全胜利。
    他高呼：
    “伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    英国朋友潘克林和潘伟今说：“在《湖南农民运动考察报告》发表四十周年的今天，英国各地群众正越来越多的学习毛泽东思想。《毛主席语录》是一本畅销书。越来越多的人认识到，毛主席是全世界一切谋求解放的人民的领袖。”
    潘克林还说，尽管今天英国的具体情况同一九二七年的中国不同，但是，“被毛主席阐明得如此清楚的基本原则却仍然是适用的，而且容易为普通人所领会”。他说：“今天对我们这里的人来说，毛主席的分析是鼓舞，又是指南”。“富有斗争精神的马克思列宁主义者决心按照毛泽东的教导办事。”
    阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会驻伦敦副代表易卜拉欣说：“虽然这个报告是毛主席在四十年前提出的，但今天它对于一切马克思列宁主义者仍然具有伟大的指导意义。”
    他强调说：“毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》应该成为一切真正的马克思列宁主义者的指南。”
    易卜拉欣说：“对于我们非洲革命者来说，这个报告是一篇宝贵的文章。”
    他说：“帝国主义和新老殖民主义过去靠反动暴力起家，现在则靠反动暴力来维持，因此必须用革命暴力来把它们推翻。在这篇报告中，毛主席正确地指出：‘农民若不用极大的力量，决不能推翻几千年根深蒂固的地主权力。’非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的农民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争也正是这样。”
