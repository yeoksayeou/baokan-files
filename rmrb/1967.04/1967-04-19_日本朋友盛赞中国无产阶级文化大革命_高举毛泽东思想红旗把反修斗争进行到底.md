Japanese Publishing Workers' Union Federation Secretary-General Banpo Fukuoka enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao, the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and vowed to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the struggle against revisionism through to the end.

Fukuoka told a Chinese reporter: "Through the practice of the struggle against revisionism, I deeply feel that the great leader Chairman Mao is not only the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people, but also the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of Japan." He said: "The practice of the struggle against revisionism repeatedly proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, it is the truth, and it is an invincible weapon in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism."

Fukuoka firmly declared that he would forever read Chairman Mao's books and follow Chairman Mao's instructions, hold high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the struggle against the revisionists of the Japanese Communist Party through to the end. He said: "In the struggle against the revisionists of the Japanese Communist Party, it is the great Mao Zedong Thought that has pointed out the direction for us to advance, and given us the courage and confidence to struggle."

He said, "In the face of the revisionists of the Japanese Communist Party who have degenerated into 'parliamentary fetishists,' do not oppose American imperialism, and are eager to collude with Soviet revisionism and rampantly oppose China, it is Chairman Mao's revolutionary spirit of 'rebellion is justified' that has taught us to draw a clear line with the revisionists of the Japanese Communist Party." When talking about their plans to publish a mimeographed publication since mid-November last year to uphold Sino-Japanese friendship and oppose imperialism and revisionism, he said it was Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "strategically, we must despise all enemies, and tactically, we must take all enemies seriously," and "all reactionaries are paper tigers" that inspired them to persist in the struggle. He said: "Chairman Mao said: 'Our comrades must see achievements and brightness in times of difficulty, raise our courage.' Chairman Mao's teachings have strengthened our determination to overcome difficulties."

Fukuoka said: Our struggle against revisionism has developed under the inspiration of the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. In the mass struggle, we have further understood that Mao Zedong Thought is the guide to revolutionary action. Fukuoka said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made our understanding of thoroughly transforming the bourgeois worldview, breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and completely and thoroughly serving the people more concrete.

Fukuoka finally said: "In the struggle against the revisionists of the Japanese Communist Party, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of Sino-Japanese friendship, and advance fearlessly to victory."

    日本朋友盛赞中国无产阶级文化大革命
    高举毛泽东思想红旗把反修斗争进行到底
    新华社东京十七日电　日本出版工会协议会书记长饭冈邦辅热情颂扬伟大领袖毛主席、光辉的毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把反对日共修正主义分子的斗争进行到底。
    饭冈对中国记者说：“通过反对修正主义的斗争的实践，深深体会到，伟大的领袖毛主席不仅是中国人民心中的红太阳，也是日本革命人民心中的红太阳。”他说：“反修斗争的实践不断证明：毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是真理，是战胜帝国主义、修正主义的无敌的战斗武器。”
    饭冈坚定地表示，要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把反对日共修正主义分子的斗争进行到底。他说：“在反对日共修正主义分子的斗争中，是伟大的毛泽东思想给我们指出了前进的方向，给了我们斗争的勇气和信心。”
    他说，“在日共修正主义分子堕落为‘议会迷’，不反对美帝，热中于勾结苏修猖狂反华的情况下，是毛主席的‘造反有理’的革命精神，教导我们同日共修正主义分子划清了界限。”他在谈到他们从去年十一月中旬起筹划出版坚持日中友好，坚持反帝反修的一个油印刊物的事情时说，是毛主席的“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人、在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”、“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的光辉思想，鼓舞着他们坚持斗争。他说：“毛主席说：‘我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。’毛主席的教导增强了我们战胜困难的决心。”
    饭冈说：我们的反修斗争，是在中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利鼓舞下发展的。在群众斗争中，我们更进一步理解到毛泽东思想是革命行动的指南。饭冈说：中国无产阶级文化大革命，使我们对彻底改造资产阶级世界观，破私立公，完全、彻底地为人民服务等认识更加具体化了。
    饭冈最后说：“在反对日共修正主义分子的斗争中，我们将高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗和日中友好的旗帜，无所畏惧地胜利前进。”
