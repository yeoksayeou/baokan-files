	“We are cadres, and we can't be wrong! If the masses criticize us, we just lie down and don't stand up to work, that's a big mistake.”
	This is a sentence that is currently circulating among the frontlines of spring production in Shanxi.
	This sentence shows that our rural grassroots revolutionary cadres, after experiencing a new storm and seeing a new world in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have become even stronger and more self-aware. They further arm themselves with the great thought of Mao Zedong, and with the help, understanding, trust, and support of the broad revolutionary peasant masses, they resolutely stand up to work and shoulder the heavy burden of leading the revolution and promoting spring plowing.

	Here are a few excerpts from the experiences of some rural grassroots revolutionary cadres during the Cultural Revolution.

	“This is what Chairman Mao taught me”

	The vast rural areas of Shanxi are revolutionary old base areas, where most grassroots cadres have followed Chairman Mao closely through storms and waves for many years.

	A moving story took place in the Xiyi Commune of Linyi County.

	Wang Chuanhe, the deputy secretary of the Party branch and a livestock breeder, is a well-known advanced figure on the national livestock industry front. He often says, “I have two beliefs (believe in the masses, believe in the Party). This is what Chairman Mao taught me.” Wang Chuanhe practices what he preaches, holding onto these “two beliefs” and fighting in the fiery Cultural Revolution.

	In Xiyi Commune, there was a young man who, unable to resist the instigation of class enemies, stirred up a wave of seizing the leadership of the Cultural Revolution. Wang Chuanhe, as the Cultural Revolution leader, naturally became the target.

	Initially, the class enemies incited the young man to persuade Wang Chuanhe to resign from his position, saying, “You are a brigade cadre, and the masses will post big-character posters against you. It's too passive to be the Cultural Revolution leader.” Wang Chuanhe firmly replied, “I am an old yellow cow. As long as I have a breath, I will serve the people for a day. The Party and the masses tell me to do what, I will do it!” He had long seen through the tricks of that young man and the group of bad guys behind him.

	However, the bad guys did not give up. Taking advantage of Wang Chuanhe's illness, they incited the young man and some people who did not understand the situation to make a big fuss, posting big-character posters in the livestock shed, trying to force him to surrender. Wang Chuanhe remained calm and began to recite Chairman Mao's quotations. He thought to himself as he recited, “I am a revolutionary vanguard and also a target of the revolution. I am not afraid of big-character posters. If the revolutionary masses post them, I will reflect; if the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements post them, I will stand firm.” There were more than ten big-character posters posted, and Wang Chuanhe, with this attitude, made a self-criticism to the masses and fought back against the enemy. The poor and lower-middle peasants' eyes were opened, and they trusted Wang Chuanhe more and more, electing him as the Cultural Revolution leader again and again.

	However, the storm did not subside. That group of bad guys, seeing that they could not “break through” from Wang Chuanhe, deceived some of the masses and removed the brigade leader. At that time, other cadres, thinking of their own mistakes, were also restless. Wang Chuanhe took the initiative to gather the cadres together to study “In Memory of Norman Bethune,” encouraging everyone to say, “We should think about national affairs, think about world affairs, not just our own affairs. If we make mistakes, we should correct them and stand up to work!”

	Cadres stood up to work, and community members followed closely. Xiyi Brigade, in the cold months, dug eight wells, each about 45 meters deep, preparing for spring irrigation.

	Bravely Shouldering Burdens Without Lying Down

	Some rural cadres, due to having more mistakes, have a more bumpy road ahead. However, as long as they bravely shoulder the burden and resolutely stand up to work, they can quickly gain the understanding and support of the revolutionary masses. Yi Xiaotu, the Party branch secretary of Beixinyao Brigade in Chengguan Commune, Youshu County, has such an experience.

	Yi Xiaotu used to be selfish and had a bad attitude, making many mistakes. Community members were very dissatisfied with him, and since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, they posted more than sixty big-character posters against him, making him reflect for six nights.

	Six nights are not long, but Yi Xiaotu's ideological struggle is not short. “People don't see achievements, and some people love to pick faults.” Although his heartache was not resolved at the moment, he did not forget Chairman Mao's great call to “grasp the revolution and promote production,” and he decided on an attitude: he would definitely not lie down, persist in shouldering the burden, and create new merits. No matter how late he stayed up, or how “sharp” other people's words were, the next morning he would greet the community members to go to the fields, fertilizing, plowing, and digging wells to prepare for spring plowing.

	Common struggle promoted mutual understanding. Yi Xiaotu gradually felt the goodwill of the community members' criticism and realized his mistakes, determined to make amends. Community members, seeing his determination, then used their spare time to hold three meetings, presenting facts and reasoning, further patiently helping Yi Xiaotu to “kill” the “selfishness” within him.

	Yi Xiaotu's awareness was raised, and his enthusiasm for grasping the revolution and promoting production was even greater. In the cold weather, he took the lead in digging wells. The superstition of “Youshu digging wells without water” was finally broken in this battle to break selfishness and establish public spirit. Beixinyao Brigade had a well that could irrigate three hundred mu of land. With water, the entire brigade actively planned to double the sowing area of this year's millet and corn.

	Revolutionizing the Soul

	Many rural revolutionary cadres, during the Cultural Revolution, often quoted Comrade Lin Biao's words to encourage themselves: “We should regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we should constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution.”

	They understood that the help of the revolutionary masses is an external factor, and the revolution of oneself mainly relies on oneself. However, from understanding this truth to realizing it is not easy, and it requires bravery to traverse the “thousands of mountains and rivers” of ideological struggle. Bao Buyi, the Party branch secretary of Dongjie Brigade in Hongdao Commune, Dingxiang County, has deep feelings about this.

	Bao Buyi, born into a family of poor peasants for three generations, saw the fierce flames of the Cultural Revolution coming and was afraid of making mistakes, not daring to work with all his might.

	At this time, he timely studied “Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan,” and Chairman Mao said, “Who is bad, who is not bad, ... the peasants all have very clear calculations,” and his heart was slightly more at ease. The poor and lower-middle peasants often talked to him, discussing spring plowing work with him every day, and he felt more at ease. At a mass meeting, he re-examined the problems in his past work. But he did not expect that as soon as he finished his self-criticism, the revolutionary masses raised a series of severe criticisms. A young man even said, “Who asked you to reflect on these trivial matters!” The revolution really came to his head, and Chairman Mao's teaching that revolution is not about inviting guests to eat and drink was also forgotten. A surge of resentment came from Bao Buyi's heart: “I worked so hard for the team, put in so much effort, but ended up with this result. It's better not to be a cadre!” Bao Buyi was in a bad mood. The thought of throwing down the burden blocked his path to self-awareness.

	In fact, the poor and lower-middle peasants had a “very clear calculation” of their branch secretary, and although they severely criticized him, they still trusted him and continued to elect him to go to Xin County to participate in the meeting to grasp the revolution and promote production. Bao Buyi did not understand this at first and was somewhat hesitant. But thinking that the Party had cultivated him for so many years, and the masses trusted him so much, he still wanted to throw down the burden of serving the people, which was really ungrateful to the Party and the people. Wasn't this selfishness at work? He suddenly woke up and took the road to Xin County.

	After returning to the village, he seriously examined his mistakes and severely touched the “selfishness” deep in his soul. He finally said to the community members, “Rest assured, don't be afraid that I will throw down the burden. I not only want to work but also want to work well!” Later, recalling this experience, he said: If you don't listen to Chairman Mao's words, don't believe in the masses, don't believe in the Party, it is very dangerous.

	There is a saying among the masses: “When looking at cadres, you should see which class they belong to, and you can't lump them all together like rotten peaches and plums.”

	Bao Buyi's experience, as well as the experiences of other cadres who have made mistakes, also shows: The community members listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Their uncompromising criticism of cadres is precisely their care and help for cadres. The attitude towards mass movements and the attitude towards community members' criticisms are testing every cadre.

    坚持挑重担建立新功劳
    ——山西省几个农村基层革命干部在文化大革命中的事迹片断
    “我们当干部，还会没有错！群众提出了批评，我们就躺倒，不挺起腰去干，就是大错。”
    这是山西春耕生产第一线上正在流传着的一句话。
    这句话表明，我们的农村基层革命干部，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，经过了一场新的风雨和见过了一次新的世面之后，锻炼得更加坚强，更加自觉了。他们进一步用伟大的毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，在广大革命农民的帮助、谅解、信任和支持下，坚决挺起腰来干，挑起狠抓革命、猛促春耕的领导重担。
    这里是几位农村基层革命干部在文化大革命中的事迹片断。
    “这是毛主席教导我的”
    山西广大农村是革命老根据地，这里大多数基层干部，多年来紧紧跟着毛主席在大风大浪里前进。
    一个感人的故事发生在临猗县城西公社好义大队。
    党支部副书记、饲养员王传河，这位全国畜牧业战线上著名的先进人物，经常说着这样一句话：“我有个‘两相信’（相信群众、相信党）。这是毛主席教导我的。”王传河说到做到，抱着这个“两相信”，战斗在文化大革命的烈火中。
    好义大队有个青年人，经不住阶级敌人的煽动，掀起了夺取文化大革命领导权的风波。王传河是文革主任，自然首当其冲。
    起初，阶级敌人唆使那个青年人劝王传河向群众辞职，说什么“你是大队干部，群众要贴你的大字报，当文革主任太被动”。王传河斩钉截铁地说：“我是老黄牛，有一口气，就要为人民当一天勤务员。党和群众叫我干啥，我就干啥！”他早就看穿了这个青年人背后那伙坏人的诡计。
    可是，坏人并不死心，趁王传河生病，又煽动那个青年和一些不明真相的人，大吵大闹，到饲养室贴大字报，想用威胁来使他屈服。王传河仍然声色不动，大念起毛主席语录来。他一面念一面想：“我是革命的先锋，又是革命的对象。我不怕大字报。革命群众给我贴，我就检查；地富反坏给我贴，我就顶住。”大字报一共贴了十几张，王传河就抱着这个态度，向群众作了检查，对敌人进行了反击。贫下中农眼睛亮了，越来越信任王传河，接连选他当文革主任。
    然而，风波并没有止息。那伙坏人看到从王传河这里“杀”不进去，又蒙蔽一部分群众把大队长选掉了。当时，其他干部想到自己的错误，也坐立不安。王传河就主动把干部们找在一起学习《为人民服务》，鼓励大家说：“我们要想国家大事，要想世界大事，不要光想自己的事，有错就改，站出来干！”
    干部站出来干，社员紧跟上。好义大队在寒冷的月份里，就一口气打了八口四五丈深的水井，为春灌做好了准备。
    勇挑重担不躺倒
    有些农村干部，由于本身的错误较多，走过来的路就更不平坦。但是，只要他们自己勇挑重担不躺倒，坚决挺起腰来干，很快就能得到革命群众的谅解和支持。右玉县城关公社北辛窑大队党支部书记伊小秃，就有一段这样的经历。
    伊小秃过去私心较重，态度又不好，做错了不少事。社员对他很不满意，文化大革命开始以来，就给他贴了六十多张大字报，要他检查了六个夜晚。
    六个夜晚不算长，伊小秃思想斗争的路是很不短的。“成绩人家看不见，有人就爱挑刺。”他心里的疙瘩虽然一时解不开，却没有忘记毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，抱定一个态度：一定不躺倒，坚持挑重担，来建立新功劳。不管熬夜到什么时候，别人的话多么“刺耳”，第二天一早他就招呼社员下地，积肥、整地、打井，为春耕做准备。
    共同的战斗促进了相互的了解。伊小秃慢慢体会到社员对自己批评的善意，也认识到自己的错误，决心将功补过。社员们看到了他的决心，接着又利用空闲时间，召开了三次会，摆事实、讲道理，进一步耐心帮助伊小秃从“私”字中“杀”出来。
    伊小秃觉悟提高了，抓革命，促生产的干劲就更大了。他在严寒的气候下带头下去掏井。“右玉打井不出水”的迷信，终于在这场破私立公的战斗中被打破了。北辛窑大队有了一口能灌溉三百亩地的水井。有了水，全大队就积极打算把今年的谷子和玉米播种面积扩大一倍。
    灵魂深处闹革命
    许多农村革命干部，在文化大革命中，常常引用林彪同志这句话勉励自己：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”
    他们懂得革命群众的帮助是外因，革自己的命主要靠自己。可是，从懂得这个道理到实现这个道理，并不容易，需要勇于跋涉思想斗争道上的“千山万水”。定襄县宏道公社东街大队党支部书记薄补义，就有深刻的体会。
    出身于三代贫农家庭的薄补义，看见文化大革命的烈火来得很猛，心里生怕犯错误，不敢放开胆子工作。
    这时，他及时学了《湖南农民运动考察报告》，毛主席说“谁个劣，谁个不劣，……农民都有极明白的计算”，心里就稍安一些。贫下中农经常找他谈心，每天和他商量备耕工作，他心里就更踏实了。在一次群众大会上，他重新检查了过去工作中的问题。可没有料到，他检查刚完，革命群众就提出了一连串严厉的批评。一个小伙子甚至说：“谁要你检查这些鸡毛蒜皮的事！”革命真的革到自己头上来了，毛主席的革命不是请客吃饭的教导也给忘了。一股怨气从薄补义内心深处跑了出来：“咱一心一意为队里工作，出了那么多力，却落下这么个结果，真不如不当干部！”薄补义闹情绪了。撂挑子的思想又挡住他自觉革命的道路。
    其实，贫下中农对他们的支部书记“有极明白的计算”，大家严厉批评他，但心里还是信任他，仍然推选他去忻县参加抓革命促生产大会。薄补义开始并不明白这一点，还有些迟疑。但想到党培养自己这么多年，群众对自己这样信任，自己还想撂下为人民服务的挑子，真对不起党，对不起人民。这难道不是私心在作怪吗？他猛然醒悟过来，走上了去忻县的路。
    回村后，他认真地检查了自己的错误，狠触了灵魂深处的“私”字。他最后对社员说：“大家放心吧，不要怕我撂挑子，我不但要干，而且要干好！”事后，他回忆起这段经历时说：如果不听毛主席的话，不相信群众，不相信党，是很危险的。
    这里群众中有句话：“对干部要看他是那个阶级的当权派，不能鲜桃烂杏一锅端。”
    薄补义，还有其他犯有错误的革命干部的经历也说明：社员们是听毛主席的话、照毛主席的指示办事的。他们对干部不讲情面的批评，正是对干部的爱护和帮助。对待群众运动的态度，对待社员批评的态度，正在考验着每一个干部。　本报记者
