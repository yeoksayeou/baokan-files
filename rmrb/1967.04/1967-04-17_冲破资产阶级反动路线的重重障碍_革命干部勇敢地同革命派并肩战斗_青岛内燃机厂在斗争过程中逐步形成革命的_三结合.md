Revolutionary cadres in Qingdao Internal Combustion Engine Factory, breaking through the numerous obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line, shattered the various restrictions that bound cadres from participating in the revolution. They bravely stood with the proletarian revolutionary masses, shoulder to shoulder in the struggle. In the process of fighting against the bourgeois reactionary line, they gradually formed a revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 15th — The revolutionary cadres of Qingdao Internal Combustion Engine Factory, from the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have united with the revolutionary masses to fight against the bourgeois reactionary line on the cadre issue. At that time, the Industrial and Communications Political Department of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee dispatched a work team to the factory, which implemented a set of pseudo-leftist, rightist cadre policies from the top capitalist-roadist in the Party. They shouted as soon as they entered the factory: "The factory party committee has rotted away, the leading cadres are all useless, and they must be replaced layer by layer!" Under the control of this reactionary line, they kicked out the factory party committee, kicked out the section cadres and workshop directors, and demoted a large number of revolutionary leading cadres.

The reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" implemented by the work team on the cadre issue was firmly resisted by the revolutionary cadres of the factory. They bravely united with the revolutionary workers, posted big-character posters to criticize the work team's crimes of suppressing revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary mass movements. The work team saw that the cadres and masses were united, and they were very afraid. In order to prevent cadres from participating in the revolution, they spread the rumor that the masses were deceived and incited by "a small handful of bad people." They also threatened to expose the "puppet masters" behind the revolutionary masses and the "backstage supporters" of those who supported the revolutionary masses against the work team. The work team even personally drafted big-character posters to attack revolutionary cadres, posting them under the names of workers. Under the direct command and incitement of the work team, a strong wind of masses attacking cadres and cadres attacking masses quickly swept through the entire factory, with 25% of the masses and more than 30% of the cadres being attacked. The executors of the bourgeois reactionary line attempted to use this method to suppress the revolutionary cadres, making them dare not stand up and unite with the revolutionary masses again.

However, the revolutionary cadres who truly defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao will not be suppressed by any reactionary forces. They broke through numerous obstacles and, with the help of the first revolutionary mass organization in the factory, the "Loyal to the Party" Combat Team, established a "Red Flag" Combat Team to denounce the heinous crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. They also mobilized the masses in their workshops and sections and other revolutionary cadres to fight against the bourgeois reactionary line. In less than a month, five combat organizations were established throughout the factory. In December of the previous year, the two revolutionary forces of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses merged to form the Qingdao Internal Combustion Engine Factory Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Alliance.

After the revolutionary leading cadres joined the Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Alliance, they dealt a heavy blow to the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, making them tremble with fear and confusion. Initially, they used sweet words to soften the revolutionary cadres and sow discord between cadres and masses. Later, they used every means to incite their puppet organizations to pressure the revolutionary cadres who stood up. Revolutionary cadres went to the workshops, and they secretly followed them, restricting the contact between revolutionary cadres and masses. They spread rumors and slandered the Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Alliance as a "royalist nest," threatening the revolutionary cadres, saying, "You are also small authorities, if you dare to act, you will be pulled down!" Two section chiefs who joined the revolutionary organization were not intimidated by these threats. They firmly said, "Even if we are not section chiefs, we will fight alongside the revolutionary workers to struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line to the end!" The handful of capitalist-roaders were still not reconciled and continued to incite their puppet organizations to issue an "ultimatum," arrogantly saying, "Revolutionary mass organizations do not allow leading cadres to participate!" They ordered the section chiefs and workshop directors in the alliance to withdraw within four hours, otherwise, they would take "revolutionary measures." At this time, some leading cadres said, "Let's withdraw, don't implicate the revolutionary mass organizations!" Others said, "Let's pull out our team and do the same revolution alone." However, the vast majority of revolutionary cadres firmly opposed withdrawing. They said, "The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are most afraid of the combination of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses. They spread rumors, shoot dark arrows, and sow discord, all to destroy our combination with the revolutionary masses. We must not fall for the tricks of the class enemy!" The revolutionary cadres repeatedly studied a passage from the New Year's Day editorial in the People's Daily: "Revolutionary cadres in party and government organs must break through the rules and regulations and those restrictive rules and regulations that bind the revolution, go to the masses, and together with workers, peasants, and revolutionary students, criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and fight against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party." After studying, they became more determined to combine with the revolutionary masses. Within two hours after the "ultimatum" was posted by the puppet organization, the revolutionary cadres wrote big-character posters to refute it, expressing their determination to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, to firmly combine with the revolutionary workers to make a revolution, and to not withdraw. The revolutionary masses also put forward the slogans "Revolutionary cadres are not guilty of revolution" and "Revolutionary cadres have the right to rebel," supporting the revolutionary cadres. They not only did not let the revolutionary leading cadres withdraw from the revolutionary mass organizations but also absorbed a batch of revolutionary cadres who had passed the test of the struggle between the two lines into the organization.

The plot of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to obstruct revolutionary cadres from rebelling was once again foiled. Batch after batch of revolutionary cadres who combined with the revolutionary masses and fought shoulder to shoulder played a huge role in the struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and in the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Many of them became the core force in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs at various levels after the proletarian revolutionary masses seized power.

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party of Qingdao Internal Combustion Engine Factory, in order to sabotage and obstruct the combination of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, in addition to using the method of "striking down a large number," also used the method of deceiving and misleading cadres to manipulate cadres to attack the masses, causing a serious confrontation between cadres and masses, making cadres unable to stand up and revolt. After the work team was driven out of the factory in November of the previous year, they selected a batch of "more obedient" leading cadres from the factory and instructed them to collect the activities of revolutionary cadres and masses. From November of the previous year to January of this year, they held more than 30 secret meetings, attempting to use this method to make this batch of cadres "go down with them." As the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line within the factory deepened, some deceived cadres began to awaken and wanted to stand up and revolt. At this time, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were in a state of panic, quickly throwing out the magic spell of "distinguishing between internal and external" and "tamed tools," demanding that all those who had participated in the "secret" meetings "keep the secret," and maliciously saying, "You have attacked revolutionary cadres and masses in the past, they will not easily believe you." They attempted to permanently control this batch of cadres who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line as capital for future counterattacks. However, the vast majority of cadres who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line wanted to revolt. They said, "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed for the people's interests, do we still have any mistakes that we cannot abandon?" They said, "External factors are the conditions for change, internal factors are the basis for change. To stand up and revolt, one cannot lie on the old road waiting for others to support and invite, but must make a firm decision to draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line." Most of the cadres who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line, despite the threats and inducements of a handful of malicious people, broke through numerous obstacles and, with the help of the revolutionary masses, actively settled their past mistakes. Especially after the publication of the editorial article "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Cadre Issue Must Be Criticized" by the editorial board of Red Flag magazine, these deceived cadres further realized that they were not only the executors of the bourgeois reactionary line but also the victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. A deputy factory director who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line angrily said, "In the past, the top capitalist-roader in the Party peddled the theory of 'tamed tools,' making us obediently serve to implement his bourgeois reactionary line. We must settle accounts with the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line on us!" The revolutionary masses seriously criticized the bourgeois reactionary line they had executed in the previous stage, enthusiastically helping them to completely break with the bourgeois reactionary line. Under the patient education and help of the revolutionary masses, many cadres who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line put down their burdens, combined with the revolutionary masses, and launched a counterattack, together with the revolutionary masses to eradicate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" in the Qingdao Internal Combustion Engine Factory. After this period of struggle and test, another batch of cadres who had corrected their mistakes were absorbed into the revolutionary mass organizations and the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs.

    冲破资产阶级反动路线的重重障碍
    革命干部勇敢地同革命派并肩战斗
    青岛内燃机厂在斗争过程中逐步形成革命的“三结合”
    新华社济南十五日电　青岛内燃机厂的革命干部，冲破资产阶级反动路线的重重障碍，打破束缚干部起来革命的条条框框，勇敢地同无产阶级革命派站在一起，并肩战斗，在同资产阶级反动路线的斗争过程中，逐步形成了革命的“三结合”。现在，这个厂已经有百分之九十以上的革命干部团结在厂革命委员会的周围，百分之八十的中层以上领导干部加入了革命群众组织；有十四名经过两条路线斗争大风大浪考验的革命领导干部，参加了厂级、车间和科室的革命“三结合”的临时权力机构。
    青岛内燃机厂的革命干部，早在无产阶级文化大革命初期，就同革命群众结合起来，同干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线展开了激烈的斗争。那时，青岛市委工交政治部派驻这个厂的工作组，执行了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的一套形“左”实右的干部政策。他们一进厂就叫嚷：“厂总支烂掉了，领导干部都不行了，非层层换掉不可！”在这条反动路线的控制下，他们踢开厂党总支，踢开科室干部和车间主任，把大批革命的领导干部打击下去。
    工作组在干部问题上推行的这种“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，受到了这个厂革命干部的坚决抵制。他们勇敢地跟革命工人结合在一起，给工作组贴大字报，批判工作组打击革命干部、打击革命群众和压制革命群众运动的罪行。工作组看到革命干部和革命群众拧成一股绳，十分害怕。他们为了不让干部起来革命，就到处制造舆论，说群众是受蒙蔽的，是受了“一小撮坏人”的挑动。他们还扬言要揪出革命群众后面“摇羽毛扇的人物”，要揪出支持革命群众反工作组的“总后台”。工作组还亲自出马，草拟攻击革命干部的大字报，假借工人的名义贴出去。在工作组的直接指挥和挑动下，全厂很快刮起了一股群众斗干部、干部整群众的阴风，百分之二十五的群众和百分之三十以上的干部都遭到围攻。资产阶级反动路线的执行者，妄图通过这个办法，把革命干部打击下去，使他们再也不敢挺起腰来和革命群众相结合。
    但是，真正维护以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的革命干部，是不会被任何反动势力压下去的。他们冲破重重障碍，在全厂第一个革命群众组织“心向党”战斗队的帮助下，成立了一支“红旗”战斗队，奋起声讨资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行。他们还发动自己所在车间、科室的群众和其他革命干部，起来同资产阶级反动路线作斗争。在不到一个月的时间里，全厂就成立了五个战斗组织。去年十二月，革命干部同革命群众这两支革命力量汇合起来，成立了内燃机厂革命职工造反联合会。
    革命领导干部参加了革命职工造反联合会以后，给了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派迎头一棒，使他们胆战心惊，不知所措。他们最初用甜言蜜语来软化革命干部，挑拨干部同群众的关系；后来，又千方百计挑动御用组织给站起来的革命干部施加压力。革命干部下车间，他们都暗中盯梢，限制革命干部和群众接触。他们散布流言蜚语，诬蔑革命职工造反联合会是“保皇窝”，并且威胁革命干部说：“你们也是小当权派，再敢活动，非把你们揪下台不可。”参加革命组织的两个科长，没有被这种威胁所吓倒。他们坚定地说：“就是不当科长，也要跟革命工人一起，同资产阶级反动路线斗争到底！”一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派仍然不死心，继续鼓动御用组织写出一张“勒令”，猖狂地说：“革命的群众组织，不容许领导干部参加！”他们勒令联合会中的科长和车间主任在四小时之内自动退出，否则将采取“革命措施”。这时，个别领导干部说：“咱们退出去吧，别连累人家革命群众组织！”有的说：“咱把队伍拉出来，单独干同样是革命。”但是，绝大多数革命干部坚决不同意退出去。他们说：“党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派最害怕的，是革命干部和革命群众相结合。他们造谣言，放暗箭，挑拨离间，目的就是破坏我们同革命群众相结合，我们决不能上阶级敌人的当！”革命干部反复学习了《人民日报》元旦社论中的一段话：“党政机关的革命干部，要打破清规戒律和那些束缚革命的条条框框，到群众中去，同工人、农民和革命学生一起批判资产阶级反动路线，斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。”经过学习，他们更坚定了和革命群众相结合的信念。革命干部在御用组织的“勒令”贴出后两小时之内，就写出大字报予以驳斥，表示要坚决批判资产阶级反动路线，要坚定不移地同革命工人结合起来闹革命，决不退出。革命群众也提出了“革命干部革命无罪”、“革命干部造反有理”的口号，给革命干部撑腰。他们不仅没有让革命的领导干部退出革命群众组织，而且又吸收了一批经过两条路线斗争考验的革命干部到组织中来。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派阻挠革命干部起来造反的阴谋，又一次破产了。一批又一批同革命群众结合起来并肩战斗的革命干部，在批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的战斗中，发挥了巨大的作用。他们中的许多人在无产阶级革命派夺权以后，成了各级革命的“三结合”临时权力机构中的核心力量。
    内燃机厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了破坏和阻挠革命干部同革命群众相结合，除了采用“打击一大片”的手段之外，还用欺骗、蒙蔽干部的办法，操纵干部整群众，造成干部和群众的严重对立，使干部不能站起来革命。工作组在去年十一月被赶出工厂以后，他们从厂里物色了一批“比较听话”的领导干部，指示他们搜集革命干部和群众的活动情况。从去年十一月到今年一月，他们先后召集了三十多次秘密会议，企图用这种办法让这一批干部“下水”。随着厂内批判资产阶级反动路线的逐步深入，有些受蒙蔽的干部开始觉醒，想站起来革命。这时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派恐慌万状，急忙抛出“内外有别”和“驯服工具”论的紧箍咒，要所有参加过
    “秘密”会议的人“严守秘密”，并且别有用心地说：“你们过去打击过革命干部和群众，他们是不会轻信你们的。”他们企图永远控制这一批曾经执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部，作为将来伺机反攻的资本。但是，绝大多数执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部是要革命的。他们说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了，难道我们还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？！”他们说：“外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据。要想站起来革命，不能躺在老路上让人去扶，去请，必须自己痛下决心，同资产阶级反动路线划清界限。”大多数执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部，不顾一小撮别有用心的坏人的威胁利诱，冲破重重障碍，在革命群众的帮助下，主动清算自己前一阶段所犯的错误。特别是《红旗》杂志评论员文章《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》发表以后，这些受蒙蔽的干部进一步认识到自己不但是资产阶级反动路线的执行者，而且也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。一位执行过资产阶级反动路线的副厂长气愤地说：“过去党内头号走资本主义道路当权派大肆贩卖‘驯服工具’论，使我们服服贴贴地为贯彻他的资产阶级反动路线服务，我们一定要清算资产阶级反动路线对我们的毒害！”革命群众严肃地批判了他们前一阶段执行的资产阶级反动路线，热情地帮助他们同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂。在革命群众的耐心教育和帮助下，许多执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部放下包袱，跟革命群众结合起来，大杀“回马枪”，同革命群众一道清除“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线在内燃机厂的流毒。经过这一段时间的斗争考验，又有一批改正错误较好的干部，被吸收到革命群众组织和“三结合”的临时权力机构中来。
