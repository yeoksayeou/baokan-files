The Power of Truth

Hearing the spread of Mao Zedong Thought makes them tremble with fear, and seeing the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" makes them shake with terror. This is a common ailment shared by U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership.

At the beginning of this year, when a small group of Chinese students in Moscow read two passages from Chairman Mao's quotations on Red Square, the Soviet revisionist clique immediately treated it as a major threat. They dispatched a large number of secret police and thugs to attack, attempting to seize the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

Coincidentally, recently in an American military camp, officers discovered that a conscripted youth was carrying a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and they were terrified. They immediately announced the discharge of this youth from military service and conducted a thorough search of the entire camp.

The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists appear to be formidable giants. They possess airplanes, cannons, atomic bombs, as well as police, secret agents, and thugs, and they have a set of bourgeois and revisionist "theories." Don't they often boast about their own "strength"? However, in the face of a golden "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they immediately lose their composure, flustered and revealing their true nature as paper tigers. This fact reflects the immense power of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Why do the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists fear the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" like ghosts fear sunlight? The reason is clear. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists represent the dying, decaying forces of oppression. They maintain their rule by oppressing and deceiving the people. Therefore, they are most afraid of the awakening of the people of all countries. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest revolutionary truth of our time, the most powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the people of all countries, it will become the greatest material force for smashing the old world and building a new world, and the reactionaries' throne will be toppled, their banquet of cannibalism will be overturned. Precisely because of this, the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists desperately and by any means try to block the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, regarding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as more terrifying than anything else.

However, whether it is the U.S. or the Soviet revisionists, you can seize and confiscate a few copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," but you absolutely cannot seize and confiscate the Mao Zedong Thought in the minds of hundreds of millions of people. The more you try to block and defame Mao Zedong Thought, the more the great Mao Zedong Thought will enter people's hearts, the more the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" will be widely circulated, and the more it will be revered, studied, mastered, and applied by hundreds of millions of people, and your doomsday will inevitably come sooner.

### 真理的威力

    真理的威力
    听到传播毛泽东思想就吓得要死，见了《毛主席语录》就胆战心惊。这是美帝国主义和苏修领导集团共同的不治之症。
    今年年初，当一小队中国留学生在莫斯科红场上读了两段毛主席语录的时候，苏修集团就如临大敌，立刻出动大批特务暴徒，大打出手，企图把《毛主席语录》抢走。
    无独有偶。最近，在美国一个兵营里，军官们发现一个被征入伍的青年带着一本《毛主席语录》，也是吓破了胆。他们马上宣布解除这个青年的兵役，并且在全营进行了一次翻箱倒柜的大搜查。
    美帝和苏修看起来都是个庞然大物。它们既有飞机、大炮、原子弹，又有军警、特务、暴徒，还有一套资产阶级的和修正主义的“理论”。它们不是经常吹嘘自己“强大”的不得了吗？然而，在一本金光闪闪的《毛主席语录》面前，它们立即丧魂失魄，手忙脚乱，露出了纸老虎的本相。这个事实反映了伟大的毛泽东思想的无比巨大的威力。
    美帝和苏修为什么象魔鬼害怕太阳一样害怕《毛主席语录》呢？原因很清楚。美帝和苏修是垂死的腐朽力量的代表，它们是靠了压迫人民和欺骗人民来维持自己的统治的。因此，它们最害怕世界各国人民的觉悟。战无不胜的毛泽东思想是当代最伟大的革命真理，是反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派最强大的思想武器。毛泽东思想一经被各国人民掌握，就会变成打碎旧世界、建立新世界的最伟大的物质力量，反动派的宝座就要保不住了，它们的吃人的筵席就要被打翻了。正是因为这样，美帝和苏修才拚命地不择手段地想要阻止毛泽东思想的传播，把《毛主席语录》看得比什么都可怕。
    但是，美帝也好，苏修也好，你们可以抢走和没收几本《毛主席语录》，却绝对不可能抢走和没收亿万人民头脑中的毛泽东思想。你们越是想要封锁毛泽东思想，诋毁毛泽东思想，伟大的毛泽东思想就越会深入人心，《毛主席语录》就越会广泛传播，并且为亿万人民所崇拜、所学习、所掌握、所运用，而你们的末日也就必然更快地来临。
