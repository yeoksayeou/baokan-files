In the great proletarian cultural revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the Red Rebel Corps of the General Trade Union of Heilongjiang Province has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. By relying on the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," we have won over the majority of revolutionary cadres and expanded the revolutionary forces, thoroughly isolating and striking down a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Dare to be bold and uphold the revolutionary "three-in-one combination"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is the party that leads the great revolutionary struggle of a nation of tens of millions of people. Without a majority of cadres who are both talented and virtuous, it cannot accomplish its historical mission." This is a great truth. It was so in the past, and it is so today. In this unprecedented great proletarian cultural revolution, without a large number of talented and virtuous cadres combining with the broad revolutionary masses, it is impossible to accomplish this unprecedentedly arduous and complex historical task.

One important feature of our corps is that from the day of its establishment on November 1, 1966, we have implemented the principle of combining revolutionary cadres with the broad revolutionary masses.

There are quite a number of cadres in the General Trade Union of Heilongjiang Province who have to varying degrees carried out the wrong line. How to correctly handle cadres and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres—this problem was sharply posed before our corps from the very beginning.

The "Sixteen Articles" point out: In general, the good and relatively good cadres are the majority. We handle the cadre issue from this basic assessment.

In several months of the movement, all the personnel in the office have revealed themselves. Under the rule of the bourgeois reactionary line, not only the ordinary masses but also the leading cadres have suffered persecution and been labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "anti-Party elements," and "rightists." Breaking through numerous difficulties and obstacles, the first to stand up and rebel were not only the ordinary masses but also the leading cadres. Many of these leading cadres have long fought against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and in this great proletarian cultural revolution, they have again been struck down and persecuted. Therefore, they naturally stand with the Red Rebels, fiercely denouncing the bourgeois reactionary line and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. On this basis, the Red Rebel Corps is a revolutionary organization combining revolutionary leading cadres with the broad revolutionary masses. According to Chairman Mao's teachings and the needs of the struggle situation, we continuously develop this combination of revolutionary leading cadres with revolutionary masses, and gradually achieve the "three-in-one combination" of revolutionary leading cadres, revolutionary middle-level cadres, and revolutionary masses.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road see that the revolutionary leading cadres and revolutionary masses have combined, and they are trembling with fear. They desperately carry out the reactionary policy of "striking down a large number and protecting a few," aiming to destroy the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." They spread cold winds and ignite evil fires, inciting some uninformed masses to attack revolutionary leading cadres, saying things like, "×× is the backer of the Red Rebel Corps," "××× wants to be the leader of the masses," attempting to sow discord and destroy this revolutionary combination. They also spread the cold wind of "those who do things make revolution, those with 'long' characters step aside," attempting to incite the masses to struggle against cadres, shift the direction of the struggle, and protect themselves.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The class enemy's opposition to the "three-in-one combination" shows that the "three-in-one combination" is very good and very powerful. We have used the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to strike down the class enemy's repeated counterattacks.

After we Red Rebels seized power, the enemy launched a new counterattack. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road instructed the "New Eight-Eight Group" and the "Red Flag" Combat Team to gather a counter-revolutionary small alliance under the pretense of "handing over power to the young generals," opposing the revolutionary big alliance. "Thorough materialists are fearless," we waged a head-on struggle against them. In the debate, we used Chairman Mao's method of class analysis, presented facts, and reasoned, exposing the true colors of a few key members of the "Red Flag" team who were fake revolutionaries and real conservatives, and denouncing their reactionary fallacy of "officialism." Faced with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and iron-clad facts, they finally collapsed completely.

From the practice of struggle, we deeply feel that the policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" proposed by Chairman Mao is very good. It is the guarantee for the victory of the struggle to seize power and the victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution. The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is the core of the great alliance of the revolutionary left. Only by implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" can we establish the revolutionary authority of the proletariat, better expand and strengthen the leftist forces, unite and win over the middle elements, and isolate the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to the greatest extent, drowning them in the vast ocean of the people's war.

Distinguish between two types of contradictions and correctly handle cadres

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." Therefore, we must strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions of different natures, not treating internal contradictions among the people as contradictions between the enemy and us, nor treating contradictions between the enemy and us as internal contradictions among the people.

In the great proletarian cultural revolution, we have followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "We must be good at identifying cadres. We must not only look at the deeds of cadres at a particular time, but also at their entire history and work. This is the main method of identifying cadres," combined with the mass line of work that Chairman Mao has always advocated, implemented the "four looks and three demarcations" to determine the nature of the errors made by cadres who have made mistakes. The "four looks" are: look at the nature of the issues exposed by the masses, whether they belong to internal contradictions among the people or contradictions between the enemy and us; look at their attitude towards the struggle between the two lines in the great proletarian cultural revolution and their degree of recognition of their own errors; look at whether their errors are consistent or occasional; look at their political performance. The "three demarcations" are: the whole corps demarcates the nature of the errors made by cadres who have made mistakes; the members of the service team of the rebel corps demarcate the nature of the errors made by cadres who have made mistakes; the cadres who have made mistakes demarcate the nature of their own errors at the mass meeting.

For example, in the early stages of the movement, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road used every means to deceive and mislead the masses, pasting 109 big-character posters on the former Minister of Education, Comrade Wang Chengmei, labeling him as a "counter-revolutionary." Some masses at that time had discussions, believing it was the work of the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Our rebel corps handed over Wang Chengmei's issue to the masses for internal investigation and external verification, and held three mass meetings in the office to demarcate the nature of his errors. The masses believed that from Wang Chengmei's attitude towards the struggle between the two lines, he stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line; from a historical perspective, his work was consistently active, although he had said some wrong things and lacked prominent political awareness, but he had not made any errors on major principles. Therefore, they believed that Wang Chengmei's issue belonged to internal contradictions among the people and was a victim of the reactionary line. We gave him a rectification.

Practice has proved that implementing the "four looks and three demarcations" has played an important role in correctly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions and determining the nature of errors.

In handling the issue of cadres who have made mistakes, there is a struggle between the two lines. For example, some people, when dealing with comrades who have made mistakes, seize on one point and do not consider the rest, holding on to it; some say that those who have made mistakes but dare not come out are "diehards" and "conservatives"; some say that those who have made mistakes but dare to come out and rebel are "opportunists," and so on. We have resolutely resisted this erroneous thought of "left" in form but right in essence, and resolutely and unconditionally implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient." The specific measures are: first, for those whose errors are serious but are not yet anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, and whose self-awareness is not deep or non-existent, give them a chance to correct themselves. Second, for those who have made relatively serious errors but have some regrets, assign specific people to help them solve their ideological problems, organize them to struggle against their erroneous thoughts, and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as soon as possible. Third, for those who have made relatively serious errors, have a relatively honest attitude, but have a poor understanding for the time being, wait patiently, help them, and make them quickly raise their awareness and change their stance. Fourth, for those who have made general errors in the movement, as long as they are not stubborn, we adopt a persuasive attitude, do work for them, and require them to reform their thoughts in their work.

By doing so, we specifically implemented the Party's policy, making cadres who have made mistakes not lose their confidence to move forward, promoting their recognition and correction of errors.

While striving to unite with the majority of cadres, for those who have been deceived in the past, we insist on solving the problem from a political and ideological perspective, firmly grasping the central link of ideological education. In actual work, we insist on the direction of the movement, focusing on criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, opposing the practice of holding on to those who have been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line and those who have done some wrong things, but instead conducting education on the struggle between the two classes and two lines, making them awaken and join the revolutionary faction to fire at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line. We feel that organizing cadres to study Chairman Mao's works with problems is the fundamental way to educate comrades who have made mistakes and unite with the majority of cadres. Holding meetings to denounce the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line is an important method. By doing so, we can touch their souls, raise their awareness, and make them break with the bourgeois reactionary line.

Because we have insisted on starting from the desire for unity and firmly grasped ideological education work, we have achieved the goal of uniting with the majority of cadres. Through the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, the Red Rebel Corps has grown from the initial 36 people to 99 people, making the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road deserted and thoroughly isolated.

    严格区分两类矛盾，团结干部大多数
    黑龙江省总工会机关红色造反团
    在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，黑龙江省总工会机关红色造反团高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，依靠革命的“三结合”，争取团结大多数革命干部，发展壮大了革命队伍，彻底孤立和打击了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    敢字当头，坚持革命的“三结合”
    毛主席教导我们：“中国共产党是在一个几万万人的大民族中领导伟大革命斗争的党，没有多数才德兼备的领导干部，是不能完成其历史任务的。”这是一个伟大的真理。过去是这样，今天还是这样。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，如果没有大批才德兼备的领导干部与广大革命群众相结合，是决不能完成这个空前艰巨、复杂的历史任务的。
    我团的一个重要特点，是从去年十一月一日成立那天起，就实行广大革命群众和革命领导干部相结合的原则。
    黑龙江省总工会有相当多的干部程度不同地执行了错误路线。怎样正确地对待干部，坚决按毛主席制定的干部政策办事，这个问题一开始就尖锐地摆在我团的面前。
    “十六条”指出：在一般情况下，好的和比较好的干部是大多数。我们对待干部问题，就是从这个基本估计出发的。
    在几个月的运动中，机关的全体人员个个都亮了相。在资产阶级反动路线的统治下惨遭迫害，被打成“反革命”、“反党分子”、“右派分子”的，不仅有一般群众，而且有领导干部。冲破重重困难和阻挠，首先站起来造反的，不仅有一般群众，也有领导干部。这些领导干部中，很多同志过去同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行过长期的斗争，在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，他们又受打击，受迫害，因此，他们就很自然地同红色造反者站在一起，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。在这个基础上建立起来的红色造反团，就是革命领导干部同广大革命群众相结合的革命组织。根据毛主席的教导和斗争形势的需要，我们不断发展革命领导干部同革命群众的这种结合，并逐步做到革命领导干部、革命中级干部和革命群众“三结合”。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，看到革命领导干部和革命群众结合在一起了，吓得心惊胆战。于是就拚命地推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，以破坏革命的“三结合”。他们刮阴风，点邪火，煽动一些不明真相的群众攻击革命领导干部，说什么：“××是红色造反团的后台”，“×××想当群众领袖”，妄图挑拨离间，破坏这种革命的结合。他们还大刮“干事闹革命，带‘长’字的靠边站”的阴风，妄图煽动群众斗争干部，转移斗争大方向，以保护他们自己过关。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”阶级敌人如此反对“三结合”，正说明“三结合”好得很，威力大得很。我们用毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器，迎头痛击了阶级敌人一次又一次的反扑。
    我们红色造反者夺权以后，敌人又挑起了新的反扑。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，指使新“八八”派和“红旗”战斗队的一伙人，打着“把权交给小将”的幌子，妄图纠集反革命的小联合，对抗革命的大联合。“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”，我们同他们进行了针锋相对的斗争。在辩论会上，我们运用毛主席的阶级分析方法，摆事实、讲道理，揭了“红旗”队几个骨干分子假革命、真保皇，形“左”实右的老底，痛斥了他们的“唯职务论”的反动谬论。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想和铁的事实面前，他们终于彻底土崩瓦解了。
    我们从斗争的实践中深切体会到，毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的方针，好得很。它是夺权斗争胜利的保证，是无产阶级文化大革命胜利的保证。革命的“三结合”是无产阶级革命派大联合的核心，只有实行革命的“三结合”，才能树立无产阶级的革命权威，才能够更好地发展壮大左派队伍，团结争取中间派，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派最大限度地孤立起来，把他们淹死在“人民战争”的汪洋大海中。
    区分两类矛盾，正确对待干部
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”因此，必须严格区别两类不同性质的矛盾，不要把人民内部矛盾当成敌我矛盾，也不要把敌我矛盾当成人民内部矛盾。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们按照毛主席的“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法”的教导，同毛主席一贯提倡的群众路线的工作方法结合起来，实行“四看、三划”，以确定犯错误干部的错误性质。四看是：看群众揭发的问题是什么性质的，是属于人民内部矛盾，还是敌我矛盾；看他在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，对两条路线斗争的态度，对自己所犯错误的认识程度；看他的错误是一贯性的，还是偶然性的；看他本人政治表现。三划是：组织全团同志给犯错误的干部划错误性质；造反团勤务组的同志给犯错误的干部划错误性质；犯错误的干部在群众大会上给自己划错误性质。
    比如，运动初期，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派千方百计欺骗蒙蔽群众，给原教育部长王成美同志贴了一百零九张大字报，把他打成“反革命分子”。有些群众当时就有议论，认为是党内走资本主义道路当权派搞的鬼。我们造反团就把王成美的问题交给群众内查外调，又在机关里先后召开了三次群众大会，给他划错误性质。群众认为，从王成美对两条路线斗争的态度看，是站在无产阶级革命路线一边的；从历史上看，工作一贯积极，虽然说过一些错话，突出政治不够，但是在大是大非问题上没有犯过错误。因此，认为王成美的问题是属于人民内部矛盾，是反动路线的受害者。我们就给他平反了。
    实践证明，实行“四看、三划”，对正确区分两类矛盾和确定错误性质，起了重要作用。
    对干部不能抓住一点不及其余
    在对待犯错误干部的问题上，是存在着两条路线的斗争的。比如，有的人对犯错误的同志是抓住一点，不及其余，揪住不放；有的对犯了错误而一时不敢站出来的同志，便说他是“死顽固”、“保皇”；有的对犯了错误而敢于站出来造反的同志，又说他是“投机”，等等。我们坚决抵制了这种形“左”实右的错误思想，坚决地不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针。具体作法是：一，对那些错误性质虽然严重，但还不是反党反社会主义分子的干部，本人暂时认识不深，或没有认识的，给以改过的机会。二，对那些犯有较严重错误但有所改悔的干部，派专人帮助他们解决思想问题，组织他们造自己错误思想的反，早日回到毛主席革命路线上来。三，对那些一度犯有较严重错误，态度比较老实，一时还认识较差的干部，耐心等待，一看二帮，使其尽快地提高认识，改变立场。四，对于在运动中犯了一般性错误的干部，只要他们不是顽固不化，我们便采取规劝态度，给他们工作做，要求他们在工作中改造思想。
    这样做，具体地体现了党的政策，使犯错误的干部不丧失前进的信心，促进他们认识错误，改正错误。
    我们在争取团结干部大多数的同时，对于过去受蒙蔽的同志，坚持从政治思想上解决问题，紧紧抓住思想教育这个中心环节。在实际工作中，我们坚持运动的大方向，狠抓批判资产阶级反动路线，反对把受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的同志和做了一些错事的同志，揪住不放，而是对他们进行两个阶级、两条路线斗争的教育，使他们觉醒过来，和革命派一起，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开炮，向资产阶级反动路线开炮。我们感到：组织干部带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，是教育犯错误的同志，团结干部大多数的最根本的一条。召开控诉资产阶级反动路线罪行大会，则是一个重要方式。这样作，可以触及他们的灵魂，提高他们的觉悟，促使他们和资产阶级反动路线决裂。
    由于我们坚持了从团结的愿望出发，狠抓了思想教育工作，达到了团结干部大多数的目的。经过批判资产阶级反动路线，红色造反团由开始的三十六人，发展到九十九人，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派众叛亲离，彻底孤立。
