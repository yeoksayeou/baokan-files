Under the close care and guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee was established on April 20. This is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! The proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses in the capital firmly declare: We must further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the mass movement to criticize the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. We will build Beijing into a revolutionary city that forever shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, the reddest of the red.

The top image is of the conference hall; the two images on the left are of the stage. Amidst the cheers celebrating the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory held a general assembly of revolutionary workers, determined to more resolutely join the mass criticism of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, and to achieve double victories in revolution and production. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are the reddest sun in our hearts, the most brilliant helmsman leading us through stormy seas! Millions upon millions of Red Guards will forever be loyal to you, forever follow you in making revolution.

The proletarian revolutionary masses and poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives from the suburbs of the capital, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, carried portraits of Chairman Mao and came to participate in the establishment ceremony of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. The heroic People's Liberation Army is the proletarian revolutionary army created by Chairman Mao and directly led by Comrade Lin Biao, the pillar of the proletarian dictatorship, and the steadfast support of the proletarian revolutionary masses. The image shows PLA soldiers singing "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" at the celebration of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, praising the great leader Chairman Mao.

    首都郊区无产阶级革命派和贫下中农代表，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，高举着毛主席画像，前来参加北京市革命委员会成立大会。英勇的人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的、林彪同志直接领导的无产阶级的革命军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石，是无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。图为解放军指战员在庆祝北京市革命委员会成立大会上高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席。
