The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fundamentally speaking, is a revolution to thoroughly criticize and repudiate the bourgeoisie ideology and to hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. To achieve a thorough victory in this revolution, we must arm the broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Lin Biao has said: "To carry out this cultural revolution well, what do we rely on? We rely on the great Mao Zedong Thought and on the wisdom and strength of the masses!" Today, our newspaper publishes the experience of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongqing Production Brigade, which once again proves this point.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongqing Production Brigade, through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have come to realize even more deeply that it is extremely urgent and important to persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They say: Chairman Mao's books are written for us to rise up and make revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao's books, if we do not study, who will? The words of our great leader Chairman Mao, if we do not listen to, who will? We workers and poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force of the revolution. The revolutionary principles Chairman Mao teaches are easy for us to understand. We will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. Whoever opposes our studying Chairman Mao's works, we will fight to the end with him.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are afraid of the workers, peasants, and soldiers studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought. They maliciously slander the workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works as "simplification," "vulgarization," and "formalism." They attempt to make people detach themselves from the actual class struggle and "concentrate on studying theory and raising consciousness," attempting to make people "hear nothing of what is going on outside and read only the sacred books," using that big poisonous weed *Self-Cultivation* to frighten, benumb, and deceive the masses.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They understand, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, that to detach oneself from the actual class struggle and from politics is to be unable to learn revolutionary theory fundamentally and is to be unable to fundamentally reform one's ideology. The *Self-Cultivation* of the No. 1 power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road is completely idealistic and bourgeois goods, completely a fraud.

The workers, peasants, and soldiers stand on the front line of class struggle and production struggle. We make revolution and engage in production; we cannot rely solely on our narrow experience but must use Mao Zedong Thought as our guide. Without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will lose our way and make mistakes.

Therefore, no matter how busy our work is, how complicated the struggle is, or how arduous the tasks are, we must persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, guide the current struggle, and raise every specific struggle to the level of Mao Zedong Thought.

To thoroughly study Chairman Mao's works and thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought, to study in struggle and use in struggle, to occupy all positions with the great Mao Zedong Thought, and to ensure that our socialist motherland will never change color—that is the fundamental task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Let us, the great people of our great motherland, hold high the bright red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and stride forward on the broad avenue of socialism!

    在大风浪中活学活用毛主席著作
    本报评论员
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，从根本上说，就是大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想的革命。而要取得这场革命的彻底胜利，就必须用毛泽东思想把广大群众武装起来。林彪同志说：“要搞好这场文化大革命，靠什么呢？靠伟大的毛泽东思想，靠群众的智慧和力量！”今天本报刊登的洪泾大队贫下中农的经验，再一次证明了这一点。
    洪泾大队的贫下中农，通过这场无产阶级文化大革命，更加深刻地认识到，坚持活学活用毛主席著作是非常迫切，非常重要的事情。他们说：毛主席的书，是为我们翻身闹革命写的。毛泽东思想，是我们的命根子。我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的书，我们不读，谁读？我们伟大的领袖毛主席的话，我们不听，谁听？我们工人和贫下中农是革命的主力军。毛主席讲的革命道理，我们容易懂。毛主席的指示，我们坚决照办。谁反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们就和他拚到底。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，害怕工农兵群众学习和掌握毛泽东思想。他们恶毒地诬蔑工农兵群众学习毛主席著作是“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“形式主义”。他们妄图让人们脱离现实的阶级斗争，去“安心地”“学习理论，提高认识”，妄图叫人们“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书”，用那本大毒草《修养》去吓唬、麻痹和愚弄群众。
    广大工农兵群众对毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。他们按照毛主席的教导，深深懂得，脱离现实的阶级斗争，脱离政治，是根本学不到革命理论的，也是根本不可能改造自己的思想的。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的《修养》，完全是唯心主义的、资产阶级的货色，完全是欺人之谈。
    工农兵群众站在阶级斗争、生产斗争的最前线。我们闹革命，搞生产，都不能单靠自己的狭隘经验，而一定要用毛泽东思想来作指导。没有毛泽东思想的指导，我们就会迷失方向，就会犯错误。
    因此，不管我们工作怎么紧张，斗争怎么复杂，任务怎么艰巨，都要坚持活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，指导当前的斗争，把每一个具体的斗争，提高到毛泽东思想的水平上来。
    大学毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，用伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，保证我国的社会主义祖国永不变色，这是无产阶级文化大革命的根本任务。让我们伟大祖国的伟大人民，高举毛泽东思想的鲜红的旗帜，在社会主义的康庄大道上阔步前进！
