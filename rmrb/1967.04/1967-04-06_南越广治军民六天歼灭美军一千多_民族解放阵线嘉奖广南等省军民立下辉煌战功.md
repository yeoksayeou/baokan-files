	South Vietnam's Quang Tri Military and Civilians Annihilate Over a Thousand U.S. Soldiers in Six Days

	The National Liberation Front Commends Military and Civilians of Quang Nam and Other Provinces for Their Brilliant Achievements

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, April 5th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the armed forces of South Vietnam's Quang Tri Province, from March 21st to 26th, continuously attacked and ambushed the enemy in the northern part of Quang Tri Province, killing and wounding over 1,200 U.S. aggressor troops. Among them, four companies and three platoons of U.S. troops were completely annihilated; three enemy aircraft were shot down, and a large amount of weapons and ammunition were seized.

	On the 23rd, the armed forces of this province alone ambushed a battalion of U.S. Marines in the New Van and Long Son areas, annihilating two enemy companies and shooting down three enemy aircraft. The armed forces fought so fiercely that the U.S. aggressors were in complete disarray and chaos.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, April 5th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency: The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's Central Region recently decided to commend the military and civilians of some counties in Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, and Binh Dinh Provinces for their brilliant achievements in smashing the U.S. aggressors' "Second Dry Season Offensive Plan."

	The military and civilians of Delat and Hoa Vang counties in Quang Nam Province, who have been steadfast in production, also bravely thwarted multiple "sweeping" operations by the U.S. puppet forces. In just fifteen days from December 11th to 25th, 1966, they annihilated 1,800 enemy troops, including 1,300 U.S. aggressor troops; shot down 13 enemy aircraft; and destroyed 20 various types of military vehicles. The military and civilians of Phu My, Phu Gi, Phu Xuyen, and Vinh Thinh counties in Binh Dinh Province, who were commended, gave severe punishment to the South Korean mercenary troops who committed heinous crimes. In the battles of November and December 1966, the military and civilians of these two counties annihilated 1,900 South Korean mercenary troops. At the same time, they also foiled the enemy's "pacification" and encroachment plans on the liberated areas.

	The military and civilians of the four counties of Phu My, Phu Gi, Phu Xuyen, and Vinh Thinh in Binh Dinh Province, who were commended, annihilated over 800 U.S. and South Korean mercenary troops in battles from January 10th to February 7th this year, shot down three enemy aircraft, destroyed eleven military vehicles, and seized a large amount of weapons. Many local guerrilla units also achieved outstanding results.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, April 3rd – The "People's Army" newspaper published a commentary on the 3rd, enthusiastically hailing the brilliant victories achieved by the military and civilians of South Vietnam in March.

	The commentary concluded by saying, The great victories of March have filled all Vietnamese military and civilians with joy. The military and civilians of the South will continue to advance, together with the military and civilians of the North, to thoroughly frustrate all the conspiracies of the U.S. aggressor troops to expand the war.
