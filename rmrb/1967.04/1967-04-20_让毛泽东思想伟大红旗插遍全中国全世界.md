The revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the capital enthusiastically welcomed the screening of the documentary film "Mao Zedong is the Red Sun in Our Hearts—Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China." They are determined to raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, to thoroughly criticize and expose the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the party, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 19th, the revolutionary masses in the capital watched the large-scale color documentary "Mao Zedong is the Red Sun in Our Hearts—Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China" with great excitement. They firmly declared that they will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and fight against the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

When the scene of the great leader Mao Zedong, radiant and full of vigor, ascending the Tiananmen Gate appeared on the screen, the revolutionary masses in the capital and the thousands of revolutionary masses on the screen cheered together. They all wished our great leader Mao Zedong a long life!

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Steel Plant said after watching the film: Chairman Mao, you are redder than the sun, brighter than the sun. It is you who led the people of the whole country to defeat the three great enemies and established the great People's Republic of China. It is you who personally initiated and led the unprecedented Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Under your wise leadership, the broad revolutionary masses rose up to overthrow the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee and the strongholds they controlled, and exposed their chief backer—the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the party. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat! Dear Chairman Mao, we, the revolutionary workers of the capital, will forever follow you in making revolution.

Many poor and lower-middle peasants in Pinggu County heard the news of the screening of this film and eagerly spread the good news. That night, they rushed from several or more than ten miles away to the county seat to watch the movie. The seats in the cinema were full, but people were willing to stand and watch. Some people watched it once and wanted to watch it a second and third time. When they saw that Chairman Mao was in good health, they excitedly said: This is the greatest happiness for us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, grasp the revolution, and promote production, and achieve double victories in the revolution and agricultural production.

The Red Guards in the capital felt extremely close when they saw their most beloved great leader Mao Zedong appearing on the screen, waving to everyone with a smile. They could not help but say: Dear Chairman Mao, seeing you, we suddenly feel an endless surge of strength. In the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we followed you, crossing one rapid current and one dangerous shoal after another, achieving one great victory after another. We deeply feel that of all the important things, the most important is to read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. Chairman Mao, please rest assured, we will definitely take over your thoughts 100% and pass them down 100%, letting your great red banner of thought fly over all of China and the world.

When the revolutionary masses in the capital learned that during the production of this film, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party attempted to glorify the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the party in the film, it aroused their intense hatred for the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the party and his reactionary bourgeois line. They firmly declared that they would better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, rise up with a thousand-jin hammer, and fight against the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the party, thoroughly eliminating the poison of the reactionary bourgeois line. The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat declared: The capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the party brazenly opposes Chairman Mao, opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, and attempts to restore capitalism in our country. We will not agree to this, not even a little. We will definitely combine the criticism of the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the party with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units, grasp the revolution, promote production, and achieve double victories in the revolution and production.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 19th, the leaders of various branches of the People's Liberation Army and the broad officers and soldiers of the garrison troops in Beijing enthusiastically welcomed the screening of the large-scale color documentary "Mao Zedong is the Red Sun in Our Hearts—Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China." They watched the film with great excitement, further strengthening their boundless love for the great leader Mao Zedong. They firmly declared that they would better implement Chairman Mao's instructions that the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses and support industrial and agricultural production, raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism of the proletariat, thoroughly criticize the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the party, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

In the midst of the triumphant songs of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, at the moment when hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses launched a general offensive against the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the party, the leaders and soldiers of various branches of the People's Liberation Army and the garrison troops in Beijing saw this film and felt boundless happiness. Their excited feelings could not calm down for a long time. They saw Chairman Mao appear on the screen again and again, and they could not help but cheer with the revolutionary masses in the film: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long, long live!" When the scene of Chairman Mao walking over the Golden Water Bridge to the crowd appeared, many officers and soldiers were so moved that they shed tears. They said, even if we use the forest as a pen, the sea as ink, and the blue sky as paper, we cannot write enough about our boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for the great leader Mao Zedong. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison who were in charge of setting off fireworks on National Day last year said: When we saw from the film that colorful fireworks soared into the sky, our great leader Mao Zedong and the revolutionary masses sat on the ground together to watch the fireworks, our hearts surged with excitement, and we suddenly felt boundless happiness. They excitedly declared: Forever follow Chairman Mao, resolutely advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought shine over the world.

The leaders and soldiers of the Air Force, Signal Corps, Railway Corps, Engineering Corps, and other units in Beijing held discussions and published special issues of wall newspapers after watching this film, expressing their thoughts and resolutions. They unanimously declared that they would be more steadfast and loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country, launch a fierce attack on the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the party, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end. The members of the revolutionary rebel team of the Political Department of the Air Force Art Troupe solemnly swore in the discussion to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out a revolution in the depths of their souls, thoroughly criticize the capitalist-reactionary line promoted by the capitalist-roader in power taking the capitalist road within the party, and build the Political Department of the Air Force Art Troupe into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.
