	British People Oppose the Labour Government Acting as a Henchman for U.S. Imperialism

	The "Friends of China" Organization Condemns Wilson for Turning Hong Kong into a U.S. Base for Aggression Against Vietnam

	LONDON, April 6 (New China News Agency) — The "Friends of China" organization in Britain issued a statement on April 5 condemning the British Labour Government for allowing U.S. aggressors to use Hong Kong as a base for their war of aggression against Vietnam.

	The statement pointed out that the British Labour Government hypocritically talks about seeking peace in Vietnam, but it provides Hong Kong for use by the U.S. fleet as a base for U.S. imperialism to wage war against the heroic Vietnamese people.

	The statement pointed out that this is an act of complicity. The British government's actions only further expose its hypocritical nature and will certainly provoke stronger opposition from the British people. The statement emphasized that since September 1965, the Chinese government has made strong protests to the British government on this issue three times. "The Chinese people are brave and resolute; they are not to be trifled with." Imperialism and all reactionaries must seriously consider China's stern warnings when taking adventurous actions.

	The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, Wilson, Kosygin, the Pope, and U Thant, are plotting new conspiracies. However, the heroic Vietnamese people will continue to strike blows against the U.S. aggressors. The Chinese people are a powerful backing for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. "The peoples of China and Vietnam are comrades-in-arms in opposing Johnson, the contemporary Hitler." The Chinese people "will continue to provide the Vietnamese people with the maximum support, even at the cost of the greatest national sacrifices."

	The statement also quoted Chairman Mao's words: "To disturb, to fail, to disturb again, to fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic."

	LONDON, April 5 (New China News Agency) — After a three-day visit to Britain, U.S. Vice President Humphrey left London for Bonn today. Throughout his stay in Britain, he heard the people's protests against U.S. aggression in Vietnam: "Humphrey, murderer in Vietnam!" "Humphrey, go back!"

	On the evening of April 2, after arriving in London, Humphrey immediately went to Chequers, the British Prime Minister's country residence, to meet with Wilson. Along the way, there were large banners reading: "Meeting of war criminals!" "Humphrey, murderer in Vietnam!"

	On the evening of April 3, Humphrey went to 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister's official residence, to attend a banquet. A group of demonstrators protesting against the U.S. war in Vietnam were waiting for him. As soon as he arrived, people shouted: "Go back, murderer!" "Go back, baby killer!"

	When he visited the town hall in the Shoreditch district of London, people distributed leaflets that read: "Those who come to our country to lobby for support for the U.S.'s dirty war in Vietnam cannot expect to be welcomed."

	The angry demonstrations by the British and other West European peoples made Humphrey and his entourage very embarrassed. Humphrey's wife, who accompanied him on his visit to Western Europe, told reporters on April 4 with a worried face: "I wish we didn't have this trouble."

	As the British people increasingly oppose U.S. aggression in Vietnam, some members of parliament are also increasingly worried that Britain will be implicated by the United States. When Humphrey visited the House of Commons on April 4, a member of parliament expressed dissatisfaction with U.S. policy in Vietnam. Humphrey even insinuated an attack on those who did not agree with U.S. policy, at which many members of parliament protested loudly, shouting at Humphrey: "Nonsense!" "Shame!"

    英国人民反对工党政府充当美帝帮凶
    “中国之友”组织谴责威尔逊把香港变成美国侵越基地
    新华社伦敦六日电  在英国的“中国之友”组织五日发表声明，谴责英国工党政府纵容美国侵略军利用香港作为美国侵略越南战争的基地。
    声明指出，英国工党政府假惺惺地谈论什么要在越南“谋取和平”，但是却把香港提供给美国舰队使用，作为美帝国主义对付英勇的越南人民的战争基地。
    声明指出，这是一种帮凶行为。英国政府的这种做法只能进一步暴露它的伪善面貌，并且一定会激起英国人民更强烈的反对。声明强调说，自一九六五年九月以来，中国政府已经先后三次就这个问题向英政府提出强烈抗议。“中国人民是勇敢而坚决的人民，不是好惹的。”帝国主义和一切反动派在采取冒险行动时，必须认真考虑中国的严重警告。
    声明指出，美帝国主义及其帮凶威尔逊、柯西金、教皇和吴丹等正在策划新的阴谋，但是，英雄的越南人民将继续不断打击美国侵略者。中国人民是越南人民抗美救国斗争的强大后盾，“中越两国人民是反对约翰逊这个当代希特勒的战友”。中国人民“将继续向越南人民提供最大限度的支援，甚至不惜作出最大的民族牺牲”。
    声明还引用毛主席的话说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    新华社伦敦五日电  美国副总统汉弗莱在英国访问了三天之后，五日离开伦敦前往波恩。在英国，他到处都听到人民抗议美国侵略越南的呼声：“汉弗莱，在越南的杀人犯！”“汉弗莱滚回去！”
    汉弗莱二日晚上到达伦敦后，立即前往契克斯英国首相的乡间别墅，同威尔逊会晤。这时，沿途有好些大字标语：“战争罪犯的会议！”“汉弗莱，在越南的杀人犯！”
    三日晚上，汉弗莱去伦敦英国首相府出席宴会。抗议美国侵越战争的一群示威者在首相府前面等着他，他一到达，人们就高呼：“滚回去，杀人犯！”“滚回去，婴儿谋杀犯！”
    当他访问伦敦绍斯沃克区市政厅的时候，人们散发了传单，这些传单上面写道：“来我国游说为美国在越南的肮脏战争寻求支持的那些人，不能期望受到欢迎。”
    英国和其他西欧国家人民的愤怒示威，使得汉弗莱一行十分狼狈。陪汉弗莱前来西欧访问的汉弗莱老婆四日愁容满面地对记者们说：“我宁愿没有这种麻烦。”
    在英国人民越来越强烈地反对美国侵略越南的同时，一些议员也越来越害怕英国会受美国连累。当汉弗莱四日访问英国议会下院时，有个议员当场表示不满意美国在越南的政策。汉弗莱竟然影射攻击不同意美国政策的人，这时，许多议员纷纷抗议，他们向汉弗莱大声吼道：“胡说！”“丢脸！”
