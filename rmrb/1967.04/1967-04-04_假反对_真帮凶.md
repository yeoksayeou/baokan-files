The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, when it comes to revolutionary people, engages in fake support and true betrayal; when it comes to reactionaries, it engages in fake opposition and true complicity. A March 26 article in the Soviet Union's *Pravda* about Indonesia is a prime example of this tactic.

The article "criticizes" the Suharto regime in Indonesia for its "active anti-communism," and claims that this "cannot but harm" its friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union.

The words sound nice enough. But this is all just a show, a trick to deceive people.

Since the right-wing military clique in Indonesia came to power more than a year ago, you have been colluding with U.S. imperialism to support this fascist regime in every way, acting as accomplices to U.S. imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries in suppressing the Indonesian people's revolution. The heinous crimes you have committed against the Indonesian people cannot be erased by a single official article!

Let me ask:

If you truly oppose the Indonesian right-wing military clique's "active anti-communism," then why do you fawn over the fascist leaders, who have blood on their hands, calling them "national leaders" and "revolutionary leaders"? Why do you shamelessly describe the reactionary regime in Indonesia, which is nurtured by U.S. imperialism, as a government with a "determination to continue the struggle against imperialism and colonialism"?

If you truly oppose their "active anti-communism," then why do you repeatedly express your desire to "further develop friendly relations" with them? Why did you invite the foreign minister of this fascist regime, Malik, to Moscow and treat him as an honored guest?

If you truly oppose their "active anti-communism," then why do you actively support them economically, maintaining their counter-revolutionary rule? Why do you continuously supply them with large quantities of weapons, helping them slaughter the patriotic people of Indonesia?

Interestingly, your friend Malik has exposed your ruse. He bluntly stated that the *Pravda* article criticizing the Suharto government "does not affect the good relations between Indonesia and the Soviet Union." Clearly, the Indonesian reactionaries know full well: you are engaging in fake opposition and true complicity.

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique published this article precisely because your counter-revolutionary activities in Indonesia have become too blatant. Now you want to cover it up to deceive the Soviet people, the Indonesian people, and revolutionary people around the world. However, this is merely a case of trying to cover up the truth by exposing it even more.

### 假反对  真帮凶

    假反对  真帮凶
    苏联修正主义领导集团，对于革命人民是搞假支持、真出卖；而对于反动派则是搞假反对、真帮凶。苏联《真理报》三月二十六日发表的一篇有关印度尼西亚的文章，就玩弄了这样一种手法。
    这篇文章“指责”印度尼西亚苏哈托政权奉行“积极的反共主义”，并且说什么这“不能不损害”它同苏联的“友好合作事业”。
    话倒是说得挺漂亮。然而，这完全是装模作样，借以骗人。
    印尼右派军人集团上台一年多以来，你们就一直同美帝国主义一起，百般扶植这个法西斯政权，充当美帝国主义和印尼反动派镇压印尼人民革命的帮凶。你们对印尼人民犯下的滔天罪行，岂是一篇官样文章所能勾销的！
    请问：
    如果你们是真的反对印尼右派军人集团的“积极的反共主义”，那末，你们为什么要把双手沾满印尼人民鲜血的法西斯头目，肉麻地吹捧为“民族领袖”和“革命领导人”？为什么要把美帝国主义豢养的走狗印尼反动政权，无耻地说成是具有“继续反帝反殖斗争决心”的政府？
    如果你们是真的反对他们的“积极的反共主义”，那末，你们为什么再三表示要同他们“进一步发展友好关系”？为什么把这个法西斯政权的外交部长马利克请到莫斯科，奉为上宾？
    如果你们是真的反对他们的“积极的反共主义”，那末，你们为什么要在经济上积极地为他们输血，维护他们的反革命统治？为什么要源源不断地送给他们大批军火，帮助他们屠杀印尼的爱国人民？
    有趣的是，你们的西洋镜，却被你们的好朋友马利克拆穿了。他直截了当地说：《真理报》“指责”苏哈托政府的文章，并“不影响印尼和苏联之间的良好关系”。可见，印尼反动派心里也明白：你们对他们是假反对，真帮凶。
    苏修领导集团所以要发表这样一篇文章，就是因为你们在印尼的反革命活动实在搞得太露骨了，现在想要掩饰一番，以欺骗苏联人民、印尼人民和全世界的革命人民。然而，这不过是欲盖弥彰而已。
