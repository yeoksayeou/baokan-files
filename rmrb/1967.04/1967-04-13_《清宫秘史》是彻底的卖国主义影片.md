The film "The Last Emperor" is a thoroughly treacherous film of treason, scripted by reactionary literati and produced by a thoroughly reactionary film company. This film propagates thoroughgoing treason. Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out with penetrating insight: "The Last Emperor," some say is patriotic, I say it is treacherous, thoroughly treacherous. Those who praise this film as "patriotic" fully expose their treacherous souls.

Chairman Mao teaches us that in the face of the imperialist beast, we must not show the slightest cowardice. We must learn from Wu Song on the Jingyang Ridge. All attacks by domestic and foreign reactionaries must not only be defeated but can be defeated. At such a time, if we show weakness and retreat, our nation's future will be doomed.

Yet, the film "The Last Emperor" that the capitalist-roaders within the party praise, spreads nothing but fear of imperialism. In the face of imperialist aggression, the film cries out that China is "weak in soldiers and strong in generals," that the Chinese people are a "disorganized mob," and that "if we fight, we will lose eight out of ten times." In short, "the country's doom is imminent."

What kind of "patriotism" is this?! This is thoroughgoing nationalism of defeat and nationalism of surrender!

Chairman Mao pointed out that from the 1840s to the early 20th century, the Chinese learned a lot from the West, but it didn't work, and the ideals could not be realized. Chairman Mao also pointed out, "The bourgeois republic that exists abroad, China cannot have, because China is a country oppressed by imperialism. The only way is through a people's republic led by the working class."

Yet, the film "The Last Emperor" that the capitalist-roaders within the party praise after the victory of the people's revolution, crazily advocates that China "should immediately learn" the "good things" of imperialism, whether in "culture" or "military," all must be "learned"; "if China wants to be rich and strong, it must reform and modernize." Thus, China "in less than thirty years, can become the richest and strongest country in the world."

What kind of "patriotism" is this?! This is thoroughgoing bourgeois advocacy, thoroughgoing reactionary bourgeois republic plan!

Chairman Mao teaches us that trying to seek aid from imperialists is a naive idea. Imperialists are "friends with honeyed words and daggers in their hearts," their "friendship" is actually aggression.

Yet, the film "The Last Emperor" that the capitalist-roaders within the party praise, propagates that "the envoys of various Western countries are all on the side of the Emperor," that "various countries will certainly forgive the Emperor," and that "not only will they not harm the Emperor, but they will help the Emperor restore the throne and revive the dynasty." The film even shamelessly shouts that imperialist aggression is a "once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity" for China to become "rich and strong."

What kind of "patriotism" is this?! This is thoroughgoing slave mentality!

In summary, internally slandering and suppressing the revolutionary movement of the Boxers, externally relying on imperialism to seek "forgiveness" and "help" from imperialism, thereby allowing the big landlords and big bourgeoisie to "revive the dynasty" and forever oppress the people, this is the "patriotism" of the film "The Last Emperor" praised by the capitalist-roaders within the party. This is the "patriotism" of imperialism, feudalism, and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. From the standpoint of the proletariat, all of this is treason, slave mentality, thoroughgoing nationalism of defeat and surrender, and counter-revolutionary propaganda that aims to drag China back to the old semi-colonial, semi-feudal path.

The reactionary literati Yao Ke, who stands on the counter-revolutionary side, wrote this script in 1948. During this period, the Chinese People's Liberation War achieved great victories nationwide. The American-Chiang reactionaries, in order to save themselves from annihilation, on the one hand, organized the remaining military forces to continue resistance, and on the other hand, increasingly valued political struggle, that is, through some democratic individualists, organized opposition within the revolutionary camp, striving to make our revolution take on a mild color, stop here, and not infringe too much on the interests of imperialism and their running dogs. The American-Chiang reactionaries did this to prevent the Chinese people from carrying the revolution to the end, attempting to make the Chinese people accept the will of foreign invaders and Chinese reactionaries, giving them a chance to catch their breath, and then pounce to strangle the revolution. The production and screening of the reactionary film "The Last Emperor" were for this purpose, to meet the needs of the American-Chiang reactionaries. Look, imperialism is "rich and strong," China is "no match for them"; imperialism has so many "good things" worth "learning"; imperialism will "help" China, making China "the richest and strongest country in the world." Such a "good" imperialism, why overthrow it? Moreover, the "Emperor" is also a "good emperor," "he helps us common people," although he is now "fleeing," but "one day he will repay the common people." Such a "good emperor," why overthrow him? The reactionary film "The Last Emperor" is like this, giving imperialism invading China a boost, advising the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries to resist stubbornly, attempting to make the Chinese revolution stop halfway and not go all the way. This film is completely serving imperialism, serving feudalism, serving the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries.

The capitalist-roaders within the party praising a thoroughly treacherous film as "patriotic" is not accidental. This is part of their reactionary thought of fearing, worshipping, and being close to imperialism, an exposure of their ugly souls. It is precisely this capitalist-roader within the party who has always praised and beautified imperialism, especially praised and beautified American imperialism.

In 1942, when the Chinese revolution was "approaching victory but also facing extreme difficulties, that is, the so-called 'darkness before dawn,'" our party, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, adopted the important policy of "streamlining administration and reducing personnel" to defeat the enemy. However, it was at this time that the capitalist-roader within the party was terrified, vigorously advocating surrender to the American imperialist-supported Nationalist reactionaries, advocating that "the Chinese revolution can be carried out under the banner of the Nationalists and the Three Principles of the People."

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Nationalist reactionaries, with the support of American imperialism, mobilized all forces to attack our liberated areas. Our party, under the guidance of Chairman Mao, led the people to take up arms and fight against the enemy in a head-on, inch-by-inch struggle. However, it was at this time that the capitalist-roader within the party was terrified, vigorously advocating the so-called "peaceful democratic new stage," vigorously advocating "cooperation with the American-Chiang reactionaries to build the country."

In March 1949, Chairman Mao pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee that our party's period of "surrounding the cities from the countryside and then taking the cities" had ended, and we had "entered the period of leading the countryside from the cities." Chairman Mao taught us, "We must learn to fight political, economic, and cultural battles against imperialists, the Nationalists, and the bourgeoisie in the cities," otherwise we will not be able to consolidate our power and will fail. However, it was at this critical moment that the capitalist-roader within the party vigorously advocated that "today, Chinese capitalism is in its youth, it is the time to develop its historical, active role, and establish merits," and also advocated that "in American factories, managers, engineers, and workers are hard to distinguish, this is the spirit of bourgeois democracy," and "our factories should be the same."

It is this capitalist-roader within the party who has always advocated the "diversity and flexibility of capitalism," advocated that "once in a capitalist country, you can buy anything"; shamelessly praised the Meiji Restoration for cultivating the "spirit of diligence and self-strengthening" of the Japanese bourgeoisie; advocated that "within the American ruling class, there are some people with clearer minds, gradually realizing that the war policy may not be beneficial to America," and "America is the strongest country in the world," advocating that our newspapers should prominently feature praises of "America is good," if only "criticizing America," it will "create a false impression" and "cultivate subjectivism." Finally, he even declared that he was willing to be a "comprador" for American imperialism.

Enough, enough! Isn't it clear enough? The capitalist-roader within the party is such a person: a person who is intimidated by the imperialist policy of aggression and war, a person who worships the so-called "civilization" of imperialism, a person who spreads illusions about imperialism, a person who advocates and prepares to rely on imperialism.

Such a person, of course, would immediately agree with the treacherous film "The Last Emperor." The film's advocacy of imperialism's "civilization" and "strength," advocacy of imperialism's ability to "help" China, making China "rich and strong," all of this suits the capitalist-roader within the party's taste, conforms to his "ideal" of developing capitalism in China, and conforms to his filthy, despicable soul that reeks of money.

The logic of the colonizers and the philosophy of the traitors are originally one and the same, "heart to heart, soul to soul."

The "heart" of the capitalist-roader within the party not only communicates with American imperialism but also with all revisionists. All revisionists are afraid of imperialism, beautify imperialism, and worship imperialism. Yielding to imperialist pressure, spreading illusions about imperialism, relying on imperialism, this is the common point of all old revisionists and modern revisionists. Old-school revisionists and modern revisionists, aren't they always praising American imperialism as "the strongest country in the world"? Aren't they always shouting that the American imperialist ruling class is "wise," "clear-minded"? Aren't they always praising imperialism's "ability to provide the best possible conditions for developing productive forces and improving people's lives"? Aren't they always praising imperialism's "help" and "friendship" to colonies, bringing "high civilization" to colonies, "developing productive forces"? All of these are exactly the same as the capitalist-roader within the party's words, without the slightest difference.

In the democratic revolutionary stage, the contradiction between imperialism, feudalism, and the Chinese people is the principal contradiction in Chinese society, and the contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation is the principal contradiction. Imperialism is the first and most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people. Now, American imperialism is the common enemy of all the people of the world, the most ferocious enemy of all the people of the world.

"Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." The capitalist-roader within the party is a counter-revolutionary who stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, an agent of imperialism. He calls himself an "old revolutionary." What "old revolutionary"?! He is an old counter-revolutionary, an old revisionist! Because he is very cunning, very hidden, he is even more a particularly ferocious, particularly treacherous enemy.

Currently, American imperialism is pushing its policy of aggression and war worldwide and colluding with Soviet revisionists in Vietnam to carry out the great conspiracy of "bombing to force negotiations." At this time, thoroughly criticizing the capitalist-roader within the party's reactionary thought of fearing, worshipping, and being close to America is of extremely important practical and global significance.

The thoroughly treacherous film "The Last Emperor" must be thoroughly criticized!

Pull down the capitalist-roader within the party and make him step aside.

The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao must achieve complete and thorough victory!

    《清宫秘史》是彻底的卖国主义影片
    中国人民大学新人大公社语文系教工大队
    影片《清宫秘史》是由反动文人编剧、由反动透顶的制片公司拍摄的大毒草。这部影片宣扬了彻底的卖国主义。我们伟大的领袖毛主席曾经一针见血地指出：《清宫秘史》，有人说是爱国主义的，我看是卖国主义的，彻底的卖国主义。吹捧这部影片是“爱国主义”的人，完全暴露了他们卖国主义的丑恶灵魂。
    毛主席教导我们，在帝国主义野兽面前，不可以表现丝毫的怯懦。我们要学景阳冈上的武松。一切内外反动派的进攻，不但是必须打败的，而且是能够打败的。在这种时候，如果我们表示软弱，表示退让，我们民族的前途就将被断送。
    可是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所吹捧的《清宫秘史》，散布的完全是对帝国主义的恐惧心理。在帝国主义的侵略面前，影片叫嚷什么中国是“兵微将寡”，中国人民是“乌合之众”，“战，咱们八成儿要打败”。总之，“眼见得亡国就在眼前”。
    这叫什么“爱国主义”？！这是彻头彻尾的民族失败主义和民族投降主义！
    毛主席指出，在十九世纪四十年代到二十世纪初期，中国人向西方学得很不少，但是行不通，理想总是不能实现。毛主席还指出，“资产阶级的共和国，外国有过的，中国不能有，因为中国是受帝国主义压迫的国家。唯一的路是经过工人阶级领导的人民共和国。”
    可是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在人民大革命取得胜利后吹捧的《清宫秘史》，却疯狂地鼓吹中国“应该马上学”帝国主义的“好东西”，不论是
  “在文的方面”还是“在武的方面”，都要“学习”；“如果要中国富强，必须要维新变法”。这样，中国“不到三十年，就可以成为世界上最最富强的国家”。
    这叫什么“爱国主义”？！这是彻头彻尾的资产阶级的主张，彻头彻尾的反动的资产阶级共和国方案！
    毛主席教导我们，企图从帝国主义者那里得到援助，是幼稚的想法。帝国主义是“口蜜腹剑”的“朋友”，他们的“友谊”，其实就是侵略。
    可是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所吹捧的《清宫秘史》，却宣扬什么“东西各国的使臣，也都向着皇上”，“各国一定会原谅皇上”，“非但不会伤害皇上，还会帮助皇上恢复皇位，重振朝纲”。影片还丧心病狂地叫喊，帝国主义的侵略，是使中国“富强”的
  “千载一时的机会”。
    这叫什么“爱国主义”？！这是彻头彻尾的亡国奴论调！
    总之，对内诬蔑和镇压义和团的革命运动，对外投靠帝国主义，以求得到帝国主义的“原谅”和“帮助”，从而使大地主、大资产阶级“重振朝纲”，永远骑在人民头上，这就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所吹捧的《清宫秘史》的“爱国主义”。这是帝国主义的“爱国主义”，是封建主义的“爱国主义”，是蒋介石反动派的“爱国主义”。从无产阶级立场上看，所有这些，统统是卖国主义，亡国奴主义，十足的民族失败主义和民族投降主义，是使中国重新回到半殖民地、半封建的老路上去的反革命宣传！
    站在反革命立场的反动文人姚克，是在一九四八年创作这个剧本的。这期间，中国人民解放战争在全国范围内取得了伟大的胜利。美蒋反动派为了挽救自己的灭亡，一方面组织残余的军事力量继续进行抵抗，另一方面一天一天地重视政治斗争的方法，也就是通过一些民主个人主义者，在革命阵营内部组织反对派，极力使我们的革命带上温和的色彩，就此止步，务必不要太多地侵犯帝国主义及其走狗的利益。美蒋反动派这样作，目的是想阻止中国人民将革命进行到底，妄图使中国人民接受外国侵略者和中国反动派的意志，让他们得到喘息的机会，然后猛扑过来，将革命掐死。反动影片《清宫秘史》的创作和上映，就是为了达到这样的目的，就是为了适应美蒋反动派的这种需要。你看，帝国主义“国富民强”，中国“不是人家的对手”；帝国主义有那么多“好东西”，值得中国“学习”；帝国主义会“帮助”中国，使中国“成为世界上最最富强的国家”。这样“好”的帝国主义，干嘛要打倒呢？还有，“皇上”也是“好皇帝”，“他是帮助我们老百姓的”，虽然他现在在“逃难”，但是“总有一天会报答”老百姓。这样的“好皇上”，干嘛要推翻呢？反动影片《清宫秘史》就是这样地给帝国主义侵略中国打气，替蒋介石反动派负隅顽抗献计，妄图使中国革命就此止步、半途而废，而不要进行到底。这部影片，完全是为帝国主义服务的，为封建主义服务的，为蒋介石反动派服务的。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，把一部彻头彻尾的卖国主义影片，吹捧为“爱国主义”，决不是偶然的。这是他恐帝、崇帝、亲帝的反动思想的一个组成部分，是他丑恶灵魂的一个暴露。正是这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，一贯吹捧和美化帝国主义，特别是吹捧和美化美帝国主义。
    一九四二年，正是中国革命“接近着胜利，但又有极端的困难，也就是所谓‘黎明前的黑暗’”的时期。我党在毛主席的英明领导下，采取“精兵简政”的重要政策，以便战胜敌人。但是，正是在这个时候，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，吓破了胆，竭力叫嚣向美帝国主义扶植的国民党反动派投降，叫嚣“中国革命能在国民党、三民主义这面旗帜下进行”。
    抗日战争胜利以后，国民党反动派在美帝国主义援助下，动员一切力量进攻我解放区。我党根据毛主席的教导，领导人民拿起刀来，同敌人进行针锋相对、寸土必争的斗争。但是，正是在这个时候，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派吓得发抖，极力推行所谓“和平民主新阶段”，极力主张同美蒋反动派“合作建国”。
    一九四九年三月，毛主席在党的七届二中全会上指出，我党的“用乡村包围城市，然后取得城市”的时期已经完结，“开始了由城市到乡村并由城市领导乡村的时期。党的工作重心由乡村移到了城市。”毛主席教导我们，“必须学会在城市中向帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争”，如果不这样，我们就不能巩固政权，就会失败。但是，也是在这个关键时刻，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，大肆宣扬“今天中国资本主义是在年青时代，正是发展他的历史作用、积极作用、建立功劳的时候”，还宣扬“美国工厂里厂长、工程师和工人很难分别，这是资产阶级民主精神”，“我们工厂里也应当如此”。
    就是这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，一直鼓吹“资本主义的多样性和灵活性”，鼓吹“一到资本主义国家什么都能买到”；无耻地吹捧明治维新养成了日本资产阶级的“那末一股干劲，发奋图强的风气”；鼓吹“美国统治集团内部，也有一些头脑比较清醒的人，逐渐认识到战争政策未必对美国有利”，“美国是世界上最强大的国家”，主张在我们的报纸上大登特登赞扬“美国好”的消息，如果只是“骂美国”，就会“造成假象”，“培养主观主义”。最后，他干脆宣称自己甘愿充当美帝国主义的“买办”。
    够了，够了！难道不是已经清清楚楚了吗？党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是这样的一个人：一个慑服于帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的人，一个崇拜帝国主义的所谓“文明”的人，一个散布对于帝国主义的幻想的人，一个鼓吹和准备投靠帝国主义的人。
    这样的一个人，见了卖国主义影片《清宫秘史》，当然会一拍即合。影片中宣扬帝国主义的“文明”和“强大”，宣扬帝国主义可以“帮助”中国，使中国“富强”起来，这些都适合党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的口味，符合他的在中国发展资本主义的“理想”，符合他的散发着铜臭的肮脏龌龊的灵魂。殖民者的逻辑和卖国贼的哲学，本来就是浑然一体、“心有灵犀一点通”的。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的“心”不仅通向美帝国主义，也通向一切修正主义。一切修正主义者，都是害怕帝国主义、美化帝国主义、崇拜帝国主义的。屈服于帝国主义的压力，散布对于帝国主义的幻想，投靠帝国主义，这是一切老修正主义者和现代修正主义者的共同点。老牌修正主义者和现代修正主义者，不是一直吹捧美帝国主义“是世界上最强大的国家”吗？不是一直叫嚷什么美帝国主义统治集团是
  “明智派”、“头脑清醒”吗？不是一直吹捧帝国主义
  “能够提供最好的可能性来发展社会生产力和改善人们的生活”吗？不是一直吹捧帝国主义对殖民地的
  “帮助”和“友谊”，给殖民地“带来了高度的文明”，“发展了生产力”吗？所有这些，都同党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的言论，一模一样，毫无二致。
    在民主革命阶段，帝国主义、封建主义和中国人民的矛盾，是中国社会的主要矛盾，而帝国主义和中华民族的矛盾，又是最主要的矛盾。帝国主义是中国人民的第一个和最凶恶的敌人。在现在，美帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人，是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。
    “什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是一个站在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义方面的反革命派，是帝国主义的代理人。他自封是“老革命”。什么“老革命”？！是老反革命，老修正主义者！因为他非常狡猾，非常隐蔽，他就更是一个特别凶恶、特别阴险的敌人。
    当前，美帝国主义在全世界推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，并勾结苏联修正主义者在越南推行“以炸迫和”的大阴谋。在这种时候，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的恐美、崇美、亲美的反动思想，更具有极其重大的现实意义和世界意义。
    彻底的卖国主义影片《清宫秘史》，必须坚决批判！
    把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派拉下马，让他靠边站。
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，一定要取得完全、彻底的胜利！
