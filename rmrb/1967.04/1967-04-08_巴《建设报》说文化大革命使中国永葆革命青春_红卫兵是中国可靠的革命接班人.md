The "Construction Daily" of Rawalpindi recently published an article praising the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is illuminated by the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong. The article states that this great movement will keep China's revolutionary spirit youthful and passionate, and it will eradicate all reactionary bourgeois influences that could lead China towards capitalist restoration.

The article points out that the international communist movement should learn a significant lesson from the Soviet Union. Currently, a small clique within the Soviet ruling class rules over the great masses of laboring people, to the extent that the laboring people cannot freely express their opinions. This is because the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union has degenerated into the dictatorship of a small privileged stratum.

The article says that Chairman Mao Zedong is a great leader who initiated this Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards who have emerged in this cultural revolution are reliable successors to the Chinese revolution. They have been tempered in the great furnace of Mao Zedong Thought. They propagate Mao Zedong Thought everywhere, wage relentless struggle against reactionary thoughts, and have eliminated all remnants of imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the exploiting classes. They are the defenders of the interests of the Chinese people.

    巴《建设报》说文化大革命使中国永葆革命青春
    红卫兵是中国可靠的革命接班人
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第电  拉瓦尔品第的《建设报》最近发表文章赞扬在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的中国无产阶级文化大革命是一场伟大的运动，它将永葆中国革命的青春和热情，根除可能把中国引向资本主义复辟的一切反动的资产阶级影响。
    文章指出，国际共产主义运动应该从苏联那里吸取重大的教训。现在，一小撮苏联统治集团成员统治着伟大的劳动人民群众，他们的统治竟达到这种程度，劳动人民群众根本不能自由发表意见，这因为苏联的无产阶级专政已蜕变成一小撮特权阶层的专政了。
    文章说，毛泽东主席是一位伟大的领袖，他发动了这场文化大革命。在这场文化革命中出现的中国红卫兵，是可靠的中国革命的接班人，他们在毛泽东思想的洪炉里得到了锻炼。他们在各地宣传毛泽东思想，向反动思想进行无情的斗争，清除了帝国主义、资产阶级和剥削阶级的一切残余影响。他们是中国人民利益的保卫者。
