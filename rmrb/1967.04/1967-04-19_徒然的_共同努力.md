Currently, the Soviet revisionist clique is getting unusually cozy with the big and small puppets and lackeys of American imperialism in Asia, hooking up with anyone they can. Meanwhile, American imperialism is not only unfazed by these activities of the Soviet revisionists but also welcomes them. What is going on here?

A report recently released by an investigative team from the U.S. Senate has revealed the secret behind this.

After spending a month "investigating" in Asia, this investigative team concluded that the United States should "jointly strive with the Soviet revisionists to develop and stabilize Asia, rather than attempting to suppress Moscow's influence on this continent."

The so-called "stabilization" here refers to the oppression and enslavement of the Asian people by American imperialism; the so-called "development" refers to the expansion of American imperialist aggression. In short, American imperialism wants to "jointly strive" with the Soviet revisionist clique to extinguish the revolutions in various Asian countries and maintain the rule of American imperialism and its lackeys in some Asian countries.

American imperialism is mired in the quagmire of the Vietnam War and cannot extricate itself, while the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is willing to serve as an accomplice. Of course, American imperialism would welcome this and how could it "suppress" its "influence"?

The Soviet revisionist clique is not only actively assisting American imperialism in the Vietnam issue but also helping American imperialism prop up reactionaries in various countries. For example, in India, the Soviet revisionists handle the "aid" to "state-owned" enterprises, while American imperialism is responsible for private investments. As for providing military equipment and food, both sides share the burden. In Indonesia, the Soviet revisionists provide more military equipment, while American imperialism provides more dollars. Even American newspapers openly state that due to the Soviet revisionists' "military aid," American imperialism's "military aid" to the Indonesian reactionaries is no longer urgent. The two sides, the United States and the Soviet Union, have both cooperation and division of labor, and their coordination is so tight that it truly deserves to be called "joint efforts."

However, the counter-revolutionary "joint efforts" of the Soviet revisionists and American imperialism are completely in vain. Today's Asia is no longer an Asia where American imperialism can run rampant. Even with American imperialism and its lackeys, plus a top accomplice, they will absolutely not be able to stop the revolutionary tide of Asia. In the end, these pests will all drown together in this great tide!

### 徒然的“共同努力”

    徒然的“共同努力”
    目前，苏修集团正同美帝国主义在亚洲的大小傀儡和走卒搞得异常亲热，凡是能勾搭的都勾搭上了。而美帝国主义对于苏修集团的这些活动，不但毫不在意，而且颇表欢迎。这究竟是怎么一回事呢？
    美国参议院的一个调查团最近发表的一项报告，说出了其中的奥秘。
    这个调查团经过在亚洲一个月的“调查”之后，作出结论说：美国应该和苏修“共同努力使亚洲得到发展和稳定，而不是设法抑制莫斯科在这个大陆上的影响”。
    这里的所谓“稳定”，就是美帝国主义对亚洲人民的压迫和奴役；这里的所谓“发展”，就是美帝国主义侵略势力的扩张。一句话，美帝国主义是要同苏修集团“共同努力”，扑灭亚洲各国的革命，维持美帝国主义及其走狗在一些亚洲国家的统治。
    美帝国主义自己陷在侵越战争的泥潭中不能自拔，而苏修叛徒集团甘心效劳，充当帮凶，美帝国主义当然是求之不得，怎么还会“抑制”它的“影响”呢？
    苏修集团不仅在越南问题上竭力为美帝国主义帮忙，而且积极帮助美帝国主义扶持各国反动派。譬如在印度，苏修包揽对“国营”企业的“援助”，美帝负责私人投资，而送军火、给粮食，则两家分担。又如在印尼，苏修多给军火，美帝则多给美元。连美国报刊也毫不掩饰地说，由于苏修的“军事援助”，美帝对印尼反动派的“军事援助”已不迫切了。美苏两家，既有合作，又有分工，配合得这样紧密，真是够得上“共同努力”。
    但是，苏修和美帝的这种反革命的“共同努力”，完全是徒劳的。今日之亚洲已经不是美帝国主义可以任意横行的亚洲了。美帝国主义及其走狗，再加上一个头号帮凶，也绝对阻挡不住亚洲的革命潮流，到头来这些害人虫只能一块儿在这伟大的潮流中没顶！
