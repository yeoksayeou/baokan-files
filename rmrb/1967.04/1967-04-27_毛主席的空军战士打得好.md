	Guangxi Military and Civilians Warmly Celebrate the Major Victory of Shooting Down Two U.S. Planes

	Chairman Mao's air force soldiers fight well.

	Guangxi garrison soldiers and officers say: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has strengthened our preparedness for war, enhanced our combat effectiveness. Whoever dares to provoke us will be smashed to pieces, annihilated, and will never return.

	New China News Agency, Nanning, April 26 — The news of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force shooting down two U.S. imperialist fighter planes that intruded into our airspace has greatly inspired the fighting spirit of the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi and the local garrison soldiers and officers. People joyfully say that this is a new feat achieved by the People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought to defend the security of the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a victory of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They warmly cheer: Long live Mao Zedong Thought that shines with brilliant rays and boundless brilliance! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

	The Red Guards, revolutionary workers, and cadres from various departments in Nanning, the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have held meetings, rallies, and demonstrations over the past two days after hearing this inspiring news. They angrily condemn the heinous crime of the U.S. bandits invading our airspace and warmly cheer the People's Liberation Army Air Force for fighting well! Fighting decisively! Fighting satisfactorily! They say, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a critical moment of decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. We are striking at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and it pains the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leading clique. The U.S. imperialists hate and fear our cultural revolution to death, so they dispatched military aircraft to intrude into our airspace for military provocation. However, they came in pairs, and our heroic People's Liberation Army shot down both. This is their well-deserved fate. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The U.S. imperialists extremely hate our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, so we must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, overthrow and expose them, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	The people of Beihai City, located on the coast of the Beibu Gulf, warmly cheer the victory of shooting down the two U.S. planes that intruded into our airspace. Comrades from the armed department of Wai Sha Commune said excitedly: This battle was fought well! It is a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors. We will follow Chairman Mao's instructions to grasp the revolution, promote preparedness for war, work, and production, and make all preparations to deal with imperialist aggression. If the enemy dares to invade, we will bury them in the vast sea of the Beibu Gulf. The revolutionary masses living in the southern gateway of the motherland, Pingxiang City, unanimously expressed their determination to learn from the heroic PLA, vow to achieve double victories in revolution and production, and make new contributions to the construction and defense of the motherland. The militiamen of Nanzhuang Brigade, Youyi Commune, under the Friendship Pass, angrily condemn the U.S. imperialists for dispatching bandit planes to bomb and strafe North Vietnam and intrude into our airspace. They say, we militiamen have long been prepared. As soon as the Vietnamese people need us and Chairman Mao gives the order, we will immediately rush to the front line of supporting Vietnam and resisting the U.S., fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people, and resolutely annihilate the U.S. imperialists in the vast sea of people's war.

	The people of Ningming and Dongxing counties along the China-Vietnam border were greatly inspired by the news of the victory. They held meetings and parades to celebrate the victory. The militia backbone forces of Dongxing County expressed at the meeting their determination to learn from the People's Liberation Army, study Chairman Mao's works actively, grasp the revolution, promote production and preparedness for war, train hard in combat skills, and be ready at any time to strike all enemies who dare to invade.

	The broad officers and soldiers of the Guangxi Military Region and the garrison warmly cheer the great victory of the Air Force shooting down two U.S. planes that intruded into our airspace. They angrily condemn the U.S. imperialists' another serious war provocation against our people. They resolutely declare that they will learn from the Air Force, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, strengthen the revolutionization of thoughts, and together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, defend the ironclad mountains and rivers of the proletariat. Yang Dingshan, a model soldier studying Chairman Mao's works from the Guangzhou Military Region, said, the Air Force shooting down the U.S. bandit planes is like giving a resounding slap in the face to the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party who are anti-imperialism, pro-imperialism, and pro-American. It greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people and greatly dampens the arrogance of the class enemies. We must, together with the people of the whole country, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and establish new merits in opposing U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism and defending our great motherland. Chen Enyong, a model soldier studying Chairman Mao's works from a certain unit guarding the southern border of the motherland, said: The victory of the Air Force once again declares to the world: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is excellent. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our preparedness for war has been further strengthened, and our combat effectiveness has been further enhanced. Whoever dares to provoke us will be smashed to pieces, annihilated, and will never return. New soldier Qiu Guohua said, the great People's Liberation Army of China armed with Mao Zedong Thought is unparalleled and invincible in the world. No matter whether the U.S. bandits fly from the sky or emerge from the ground, they cannot escape the fate of being annihilated. He expressed his determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, tightly grip the rifle in his hand, and be ready at any time to annihilate all enemies who dare to invade.
