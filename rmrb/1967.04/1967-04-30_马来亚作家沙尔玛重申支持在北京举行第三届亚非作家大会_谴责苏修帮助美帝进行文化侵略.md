Malaysian writer Salma recently issued a statement strongly condemning the fake “Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference” organized by Soviet revisionists in Beirut.

The statement said that since the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement established the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau in 1958, there has been a fierce struggle between two lines: one is the revolutionary line of opposing imperialism and all reactionaries and fighting for national liberation; the other is the counter-revolutionary line of Soviet modern revisionists who sabotage the unity of the Afro-Asian peoples and capitulate to imperialism led by the United States.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet revisionists, with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, held the fake “Third Conference” in Beirut. This fully shows that the Soviet revisionists are colluding with imperialism led by the United States and various reactionary forces in the cultural field to sabotage the unity of the Afro-Asian peoples and provide more opportunities for imperialism to carry out cultural aggression.

The statement said that the policies of “peaceful coexistence” and “peaceful competition” and their products—various forms of “cultural cooperation”—are serving the overall strategy of “U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world.” Increasing evidence shows that the Soviet revisionists are coordinating their cultural activities with other aspects to capitulate to U.S. imperialism. In the same month that they held the fake “Third Conference,” they signed an agreement with the U.S. monopoly capitalist groups to establish industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union on the basis of each investing 50%, giving the U.S. consortium greater benefits and completely betraying the workers and people of the Soviet Union. Almost at the same time as they betrayed the Afro-Asian writers in Beirut, the Soviet revisionists established closer trade and diplomatic relations with the British neocolonialism of “Malaysia” supported by the United States, in order to provide more direct economic aid to the puppet regime of Abdul Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew in Malaya. The Soviet revisionists are undoubtedly doing this to strengthen the reactionary regime and help them suppress the national liberation movement of the Malayan people.

The statement said that the Soviet revisionists, imitating the American business model, have long tried to peddle reactionary “humanitarian” proposals in the field of culture and art. These proposals abstractly and generally discuss the promotion of national culture and literature. The Soviet revisionists attempt to use such methods to divert the attention of Afro-Asian writers from their fighting political tasks. In fact, they are colluding with imperialism led by the United States and all reactionaries to sabotage our national liberation movements. Therefore, the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, chaired by the great leader of the Chinese and world revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong, pointed out at its Eleventh Plenary Session, “To oppose imperialism, we must oppose modern revisionism.”

In his statement, Salma emphasized that he represents the progressive writers of Malaya (including Singapore) in reiterating that we oppose the fake “Third Conference” in Beirut. We wholeheartedly support the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference, which will be held in Beijing this year under the leadership of Secretary-General Senanayake. We are determined to strengthen our ranks and unite with all other progressive writers and revolutionary peoples of Afro-Asia to make greater contributions to the cause of uniting the Afro-Asian peoples to fight against imperialism led by the United States and all reactionaries, as well as against modern revisionism centered in Moscow.

### 马来亚作家沙尔玛重申支持在北京举行第三届亚非作家大会  谴责苏修帮助美帝进行文化侵略

    马来亚作家沙尔玛重申支持在北京举行第三届亚非作家大会
    谴责苏修帮助美帝进行文化侵略
    新华社二十九日讯  马来亚作家沙尔玛最近发表声明，强烈谴责苏修在贝鲁特制造的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”。
    声明说，亚非作家运动自从一九五八年成立亚非作家常设局以来，就一直存在着两条路线的激烈斗争，一条是反对帝国主义和一切反动派，争取民族解放的革命路线，一条是苏联现代修正主义者破坏亚非人民团结、向以美国为首的帝国主义投降的反革命路线。
    声明指出，苏联修正主义者在联合国教育、科学及文化组织的支援下在贝鲁特举行伪“三大”，这充分说明苏联修正主义者正在文化领域内同以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派勾结在一起，破坏亚非人民的团结，向帝国主义提供更多的进行文化侵略的机会。
    声明说，“和平共处”与“和平竞赛”的政策及其产物——各种形式的
  “文化合作”是为“美苏合作主宰世界”的总战略服务的。日益增多的事实证明，苏修使他们的文化活动同其他各方面的活动相配合，向美帝国主义投降。在举行伪“三大”的同一个月中，他们同美国垄断资本集团签订协定，决定在各投资百分之五十的基础上在苏联建立工业企业，使美国财团得到更大的利益，完全背叛了苏联的工人和人民。几乎在贝鲁特出卖亚非作家的同时，苏修同得到美国支持的英国新殖民主义“马来西亚”建立了更密切的贸易和外交关系，以便向马来亚（阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼—李光耀）傀儡集团提供更加直接的经济援助。苏修这样做无疑是为了加强反动政权，帮助他们镇压马来亚人民的民族解放运动。
    声明说，苏联修正主义者模仿美国那套生意经，一直企图向亚非作家兜售文化艺术上的反动的
  “人道主义”主张，这种主张，抽象地、笼统地谈论什么“促进民族文化和文学的发展”。苏联修正主义者企图用这样的办法来转移亚非作家对战斗的政治任务的注意，他们实际上是在勾结以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派来破坏我们的民族解放运动。因此，中国和世界革命的伟大导师毛泽东同志主持的中国共产党第八届中央委员会第十一次全体会议英明透彻地指出，“要反对帝国主义，就必须反对现代修正主义。”
    沙尔玛在声明中强调说，我代表马来亚（包括新加坡）的进步作家重申，我们反对贝鲁特的伪“三大”，我们衷心支持今年将由秘书长森纳那亚克为首的亚非作家常设局在北京举行的第三届亚非作家大会。我们决心加紧团结我们的队伍，同所有其他进步作家和亚非革命人民联合起来，对亚非人民团结起来为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派以及以莫斯科为中心的现代修正主义而斗争的事业，作出更大的贡献。
