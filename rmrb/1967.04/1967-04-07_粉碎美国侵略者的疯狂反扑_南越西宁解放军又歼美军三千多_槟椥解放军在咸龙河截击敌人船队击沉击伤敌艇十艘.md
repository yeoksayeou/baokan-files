The Liberation Army in South Vietnam's Xinhai Province has once again achieved a glorious victory by annihilating over 3,100 American troops.

The Liberation Army in Binh Tuy Province intercepted and attacked enemy ships on the Ham Luong River, sinking and damaging ten enemy boats.

	Hanoi, April 6 (Xinhua) - According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the armed forces of Xinhai Province in South Vietnam bravely counterattacked the new large-scale "sweeping" operations launched by the American puppet forces in the northeastern region of Xinhai Province from March 20 to April 3. They achieved a brilliant victory by annihilating over 3,100 American aggressors. According to incomplete statistics, among the annihilated enemies, an entire American infantry battalion and two companies were wiped out, and an artillery battalion was severely damaged.

	In addition, the armed forces also destroyed fifteen cannons, 346 military vehicles, including 249 tanks and armored vehicles, and shot down 40 aircraft of various types.

	The report said that the American bandits, unwilling to accept their heavy losses in the northern and northwestern parts of Xinhai Province, assembled five American brigades and some puppet forces to launch a large-scale "sweeping" operation in the northeastern region of Xinhai Province on March 20. However, as soon as the American bandits entered the liberated area, they were attacked everywhere. The armed forces firmly held onto the enemies without letting go, using their strengths to attack the enemies' weaknesses. They sometimes laid minefields, sometimes bombarded and attacked, making the enemies disoriented and annihilating a large number of enemy forces. On March 21 alone, in the battles of Thua Thien and Soc Trang, the armed forces wiped out an entire American infantry battalion and two companies, severely damaged an artillery battalion, killing and wounding over 900 American aggressors, and shooting down and destroying 22 aircraft of various types.

	At present, the American bandits' large-scale "sweeping" operation in the northeastern region of Xinhai Province is in a dilemma of advance and retreat, and it will inevitably suffer even heavier losses.

	Hanoi, April 6 (Xinhua) - According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the armed forces of Binh Tuy Province in South Vietnam intercepted and attacked enemy ships on the Ham Luong River on March 23, annihilating over 1,000 American puppet forces, including wiping out two American companies, and sinking and damaging ten enemy landing boats.

	At 8 AM on March 23, the armed forces intercepted a fleet of ships loaded with American aggressors on the Ham Luong River. All enemy boats were hit and set on fire, with one landing boat immediately sunk. The armed forces wiped out two American companies in this interception.

	At noon on the same day, the armed forces intercepted another enemy fleet on the Ham Luong River, sinking five enemy landing boats and severely damaging three, killing and wounding over 700 enemies.

	According to another report, the armed forces of Phu Yen Province killed and wounded 259 American aggressors and shot down one helicopter in a week up to March 19.

	Hanoi, April 6 (Xinhua) - According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam: The armed forces of Quang Ngai Province in South Vietnam launched a fierce and accurate artillery attack on the American military base in the Go Vap area and the American base in De Phu County on March 23, causing heavy casualties and losses to the enemy.

	According to preliminary information, in this attack, the armed forces killed and wounded over 400 American aggressors; two ammunition depots and one fuel depot were hit and exploded; many barracks and fortifications were also destroyed.

	In addition, the armed forces also destroyed six enemy aircraft, ten military vehicles, and six cannons.

    新华社河内六日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方西宁省解放武装力量，从三月二十日到四月三日，英勇反击美伪军对西宁省东北地区发动的新的大规模“扫荡”，又取得了歼灭美国侵略军三千一百多名的辉煌胜利。据不完全统计，在被歼灭的敌人中，包括全歼美国步兵一个营和两个连，重创一个炮兵营。
