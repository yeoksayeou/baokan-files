	The People's Fine Arts Publishing House is publishing a collection of drawings by Red Guards. These drawings vividly depict the great proletarian cultural revolution and the heroic deeds of the Red Guards. They are a powerful ideological weapon in the struggle to smash the bourgeois reactionary line in the field of art and to carry the proletarian revolutionary line through to the end. The collection includes a variety of themes such as the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line in the field of art, the criticism of the "four olds," the smashing of the "four olds," and the establishment of the "four new." It also features the heroic deeds of the Red Guards in the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line in the field of education. The collection is a valuable resource for Red Guards and revolutionary masses to learn from and draw inspiration. It is also an important tool for the propaganda of the great proletarian cultural revolution.
