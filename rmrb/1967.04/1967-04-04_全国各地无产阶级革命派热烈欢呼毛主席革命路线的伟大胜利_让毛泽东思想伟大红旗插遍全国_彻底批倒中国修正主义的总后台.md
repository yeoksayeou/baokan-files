Nationwide proletarian revolutionaries warmly celebrate the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought be hoisted across the nation. Thoroughly criticize and overthrow the chief backer of Chinese revisionism.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 3rd, the editorial article "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Cadres Issue Must Be Criticized" by the editorial board of *Red Flag* magazine and the important article "Patriotism or Treachery?" by Comrade Chen Boda, have sparked immense indignation among the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries nationwide against the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. Over the past two days, following Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan, Harbin, Taiyuan, and Guiyang, from the shores of the Bohai Sea to the north and south of the Tian Mountains, from the Kangba Plateau to the banks of the Yalu River, large-scale rallies and demonstrations have been held in major and medium-sized cities across the country, vehemently denouncing the heinous crimes of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party.

Revolutionary masses participating in rallies and demonstrations across the country carried red flags, held high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, waved red copies of the *Quotations from Chairman Mao*, sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and chanted slogans such as: "Down with the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party!" "Let the invincible red flag of Mao Zedong Thought be hoisted across the entire country!" "Long live, ten thousand times long live, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao!" They enthusiastically hailed the publication of "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Cadres Issue Must Be Criticized" and "Patriotism or Treachery?" saying that these articles spoke the minds of the proletarian revolutionaries. These two articles exposed the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party and the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party who supported them from behind the scenes. The exposure was thorough and deep, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionaries and thoroughly crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary workers from various places at the rallies and demonstrations vehemently denounced the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party for concocting the reactionary fallacy of "the working people welcoming exploitation." They angrily said: The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party absurdly claims that "China does not have too much capitalism but too little," "today's capitalist exploitation is not only not evil but also has merit," and loudly proclaims that "the working people do not oppose exploitation but welcome it," "workers want you to exploit them, otherwise they will suffer greatly," and so on. This is sheer nonsense. We workers suffered endless exploitation and oppression from the capitalists in the old society. We workers hate exploitation to the core. Who says we welcome it? Only the capitalists and the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party who breathe the same air as the capitalists welcome it. Many old workers said: We workers, in the old society, suffered endless cruel oppression and exploitation from the capitalists. The capitalists drove us to the point of destitution and family ruin. The history of capitalist exploitation is the history of our workers' blood and tears. We hate those capitalists the most, and we hate the exploitative system that eats people the most. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party absurdly claims "welcoming exploitation," attempting to turn the wheel of history backward, to restore the capitalist system in China, and to make us working people become beasts of burden again. This is extremely reactionary and despicable. We workers will use our blood and lives to defend Chairman Mao and defend the iron-clad socialist mountains and seas, and we will definitely pull down the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and make him step aside!

Representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants at various demonstrations pointed out: The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party claims that "exploitation saves people," "hiring labor is not exploitation." This is purely landlord theory. They said: We poor and lower-middle peasants lived a life worse than cattle in the old society. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the sea of suffering. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party advocates "three freedoms and one contract," and the ghosts and snakes in the countryside have also come out, saying that collective economy should be "big to small, small to none." They are all in cahoots, attempting to restore capitalism. We poor and lower-middle peasants will never agree to this, not in a thousand ways, not in ten thousand ways!

At the rallies and various discussions, the broad revolutionary masses exposed the poisonous weed written by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, "Cultivation," and resolved to thoroughly criticize and denounce it. Proletarian revolutionary fighters stated: We must launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, and uproot this poisonous weed "Cultivation."

Proletarian revolutionaries across the country also exposed the crimes of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party in advocating and implementing the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressing revolutionary masses, and strangling the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary masses across the country also pointed out: The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party has, for many years, usurped important positions in the Party, doing countless evil deeds against Mao Zedong Thought. Now is the time to settle accounts with him! Proletarian revolutionary fighters solemnly pledge to Chairman Mao: We will definitely hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the fearless revolutionary spirit of "daring to pull the emperor off his horse," fight down, fight to ruin, and fight to disgrace the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, and throw all big and small Khrushchevs into the garbage heap, resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and ensure that the proletarian iron-clad mountains and seas of our country will never change color.

    全国各地无产阶级革命派热烈欢呼毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利
    让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全国  彻底批倒中国修正主义的总后台
    据新华社三日讯　《红旗》杂志评论员文章《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》和戚本禹同志的重要文章《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》的发表，激起了全国各地广大无产阶级革命派对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的无比义愤。两天来，继北京、上海、济南、哈尔滨、太原、贵阳之后，从渤海之滨到天山南北，从康藏高原到鸭绿江畔，全国各地各大中城市普遍举行规模盛大的集会和示威游行，愤怒声讨党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。
    各地参加集会和示威游行的革命群众，打着红旗，高举我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像，手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲，高呼：“打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派！”“把伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想红旗插遍全中国！”“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们热烈欢呼《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》和《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》的发表好得很，说出了无产阶级革命派的心里话。这两篇文章揭露了党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子以及在背后支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪行，揭得深，揭得透，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    参加集会和示威游行的各地革命工人痛斥党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派制造所谓劳动人民“欢迎剥削”的反动谬论。他们愤怒地说：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，胡说什么“中国不是资本主义太多了，而是资本主义太少了”，“今天资本主义的剥削不但没有罪恶，而且有功劳”，大叫什么“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削”，“工人要你剥削，不剥削人家就苦得很”等等，这纯粹是一派胡言。我们工人在旧社会受尽了资本家的剥削压迫。对于剥削，我们工人阶级恨之入骨，谁说我们欢迎？只有资本家和跟资本家一鼻孔出气的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派才欢迎。许多老工人说：我们工人阶级，在旧社会受尽了资本家的残酷压迫和剥削，资本家把我们逼得流离失所，家破人亡。资本家的剥削史，就是我们工人阶级的血泪史。我们最恨那些资本家，最恨那个人吃人的剥削制度。然而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却胡说什么“欢迎剥削”，妄想把历史的车轮拉向后转，在中国复辟资本主义制度，让我们劳动人民重新当牛作马，真是反动透顶，可恶之极。我们工人阶级要用鲜血和生命去保卫毛主席，保卫社会主义的铁打江山，誓把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派拉下马，叫他靠边站！
    贫下中农的代表在各地举行的示威集会上指出：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派说什么“剥削是救人”，“雇人劳动，不叫剥削”，这完全是地主的理论。他们说：我们贫下中农在旧社会过着牛马不如的痛苦生活，是毛主席他老人家把我们从苦海里救了出来。可是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却鼓吹“三自一包”，农村中的牛鬼蛇神也跳了出来，说什么集体经济应该“大化小、小化了”，他们完全是一个鼻孔出气，妄图恢复资本主义。我们贫下中农，一千个不答应，一万个不答应！
    在集会和各种座谈会上，广大革命群众揭露了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派写的那本大毒草《修养》，决心彻底把它批倒批臭。无产阶级革命派战士表示：我们一定要掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把《修养》这株大毒草连根铲除。
    各地无产阶级革命派还纷纷揭露了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派提出和推行资产阶级反动路线，镇压革命群众，扼杀无产阶级文化大革命的滔天罪行。
    各地革命群众还指出：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，多年来窃据党的重要职务，干尽了反毛泽东思想的坏事。现在是向他清算的时候了！无产阶级革命派战士向毛主席庄严宣誓：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏的革命精神，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，把大大小小的赫鲁晓夫扔到垃圾堆里去，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保证我国无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色。
