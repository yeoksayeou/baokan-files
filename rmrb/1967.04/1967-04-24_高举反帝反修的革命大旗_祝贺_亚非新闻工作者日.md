Today is the "Day of Asian and African Journalists." Revolutionary journalists from Asia and Africa, in the excellent situation of the worldwide struggle against imperialism and revisionism, are enthusiastically celebrating this glorious day at their respective battle stations.

Four years ago today, the Asian and African Journalists Association was born. Over the past four years, the Asian and African Journalists Association has traversed a bumpy road of struggle. It has made uncompromising exposures and resolute struggles against imperialism led by the United States. It has engaged in irreconcilable struggles against the capitulationist and splitist line of the Soviet revisionist leadership. It has firmly supported the Vietnamese people's anti-American patriotic struggle and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. It has given a powerful rebuke to the destructive activities of the Indian reactionaries. It has broken through the white terror of the right-wing fascist military clique in Indonesia, fearlessly resisting and persevering in the struggle.

The Asian and African Journalists Association has always maintained a firm and clear stance in the cause of uniting against imperialism.

The Asian and African Journalists Association is indeed a fighting force in the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle in the Asia and Africa region and is indeed a revolutionary and fighting organization of journalists.

Currently, there are various types of journalists' organizations in the world. There are revolutionary journalists' organizations, journalists' organizations controlled by imperialism, and journalists' organizations controlled by modern revisionism.

The so-called "International Journalists Association" headquartered in Prague is an organization controlled by the Soviet revisionist leadership. This organization, while sometimes feigning to shout a few empty slogans of "supporting Vietnam and opposing the United States," actually engages in the evil deeds of capitulation, betrayal, and splitting.

It is precisely this "International Journalists Association" and its actual controllers, the Soviet revisionist leadership, who, without distinguishing right from wrong, shout that "the serious danger represented by the Vietnam War should be condemned," playing along with the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy of "using war to force surrender." They desperately plead with the U.S. imperialists' puppet organization, the "International Federation of Journalists," to cooperate, and they humbly beg for the status of "consultative" in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. They remain silent on the issue of the Indonesian Communist Party's _People's Daily_ journalist Anwar Darma being unjustly expelled from Moscow. They also use their publications to publish vicious attacks on the Asian and African Journalists Association and the Chinese Journalists Association in the form of articles and pictures.

This so-called "International Journalists Association" is a bunch of traitors to the world's revolutionary journalists. They completely betray the will of the vast majority of progressive journalists around the world to unite against imperialism and have degenerated into a shameful tool for promoting the "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world" revisionist line.

Facts have proven that in the Asian and African news industry, there has always been a sharp struggle between two lines. The Asian and African Journalists Association adheres to the revolutionary line and engages in just and revolutionary causes, and therefore is supported and endorsed by the Asian and African peoples and revolutionary journalists, possessing a powerful vitality. Those journalists' organizations that promote the line of capitulation and splitting will inevitably be spurned by the revolutionary people and head towards a shameful failure.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the armed forces. However, having only such forces is not enough. We must also have a cultural army, which is an indispensable force for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy."

Progressive revolutionary journalists are an important component of this cultural army. We are firmly convinced that the vast number of revolutionary journalists in Asia and Africa and their fighting organization—the Asian and African Journalists Association—will further grow and strengthen in the great waves of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist revolutionary struggle.

We, the revolutionary journalists of China, will, as always, stand together with the vast number of revolutionary journalists in the Asia and Africa region, continue to hold high the banner of the revolutionary line of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, take the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the weapon to drive the peoples of Asia and Africa and the revolutionary peoples of the world to carry out revolutionary struggles, pick up our pens, unite the people, educate the people, strike at the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, and carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries to the end!

    高举反帝反修的革命大旗
    ——祝贺“亚非新闻工作者日”
    本报评论员
    今天，是“亚非新闻工作者日”。广大革命的亚非新闻工作者，在全世界反帝反修斗争的大好形势下，在各自的战斗岗位上，热烈地庆祝这个光荣的节日。
    四年前的今天，亚非新闻工作者协会诞生了。四年来，亚非记协走过了不平坦的斗争历程。它对以美国为首的帝国主义，作了无情的揭露和坚决的斗争。它同苏联修正主义领导集团的投降主义和分裂主义路线，进行了不调和的斗争。它坚决支持越南人民的反美爱国斗争和各国人民的革命斗争。它对印度反动派的破坏活动，给予了有力的回击。它冲破印尼右派法西斯军人集团的白色恐怖，不畏强暴，坚持斗争。
    亚非记协在团结反帝的革命事业中，始终立场坚定，旗帜鲜明。
    亚非记协不愧是亚非地区反帝革命斗争的一支战斗队伍，不愧是一个革命的战斗的新闻工作者组织。
    目前，世界上有各种各样的新闻工作者组织。有革命的新闻工作者组织，有帝国主义掌握的新闻工作者组织，也有现代修正主义控制的新闻工作者组织。
    总部设在布拉格的所谓“国际新闻工作者协会”，就是一个为苏修领导集团控制的组织。这个组织，虽然有时装腔作势喊几句“援越反美”的空话，但是，实际上干的却是投降、叛卖、分裂的罪恶勾当。
    正是这个“国际新闻工作者协会”及其实际操纵者苏修领导集团，不分青红皂白，叫嚷
  “应该谴责以越南战争为代表的严重危险”，为美国的“以战压降”阴谋帮腔。他们苦苦哀求同美帝国主义的御用工具“国际新闻工作者联合会”合作，低三下四地乞求取得联合国教科文组织的“咨询”地位。他们对印尼共《人民日报》记者安瓦尔·达尔马被无理驱逐出莫斯科一事，不吭一声。他们还利用自己的刊物，发表恶毒攻击亚非记协和中国记协的文章和图片。
    这个所谓“国际新闻工作者协会”，是一伙地地道道的世界革命新闻工作者的叛徒。他们完全违背了全世界广大进步新闻工作者团结反帝的意志，堕落成为推行“美苏合作主宰世界”修正主义路线的一个可耻的工具。
    事实证明，在亚非新闻事业中，始终存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争。亚非记协坚持革命路线，从事着正义的革命的事业，因而为亚非人民和革命新闻工作者所拥护和支持，具有强大的生命力。而那些推行投降、分裂路线的新闻工作者组织，必然被革命人民所唾弃，走向可耻的失败。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”
    进步的革命的新闻工作者，就是这支文化军队的一个重要组成部分。我们坚信，亚非广大的革命新闻工作者及其战斗组织——亚非记协，必将在反帝反修的革命斗争的大风大浪中，进一步成长壮大起来。
    我们中国的革命新闻工作者，将一如既往地同亚非地区广大的革命新闻工作者团结在一起，继续高举反帝反修的革命路线的旗帜，把战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为推动亚非人民、全世界革命人民进行革命斗争的战斗武器，拿起手中的笔杆子，团结人民，教育人民，打击敌人，消灭敌人，将反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义以及各国反动派的斗争进行到底！
