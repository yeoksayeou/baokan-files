President Massamba-Debat of the Congo (Brazzaville) presided over the completion ceremony of the Congo (Brazzaville) shortwave broadcasting station on April 8 in Brazzaville. This station was built with the aid of China.

Accompanied by Li Chen-guang, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the Congo (Brazzaville), President Massamba-Debat inspected the various facilities of the station. He asked the Chinese acting charge d'affaires to convey the most sincere thanks of the government and people of the Congo (Brazzaville) to Chairman Mao Zedong.

In his speech at the ceremony, President Massamba-Debat said, "The aid China has given us is completely selfless." He expressed great satisfaction with the project. He enthusiastically praised the Chinese experts who helped build the station, saying they had a good work style, were highly effective, and genuinely helped the people of the Congo (Brazzaville).

In his speech, President Massamba-Debat condemned the imperialists' slander against China. He said, "Such slanderous propaganda cannot make the brave Chinese people, who have rallied around their highly respected leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, retreat." He added that, on the contrary, such propaganda would only strengthen China's resolve to carry on the sacred struggle against imperialism led by the United States to the end.

In his speech at the ceremony, Li Chen-guang, the acting charge d'affaires, said, "This project was completed in less than a year. This vividly shows that the people of the Congo (Brazzaville) are a hardworking people. Once they have shaken off colonial rule, they fully display their enthusiasm and wisdom in work and construction." He concluded, "The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will forever be reliable friends of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people in their struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism."

    马桑巴—代巴总统主持中国援建发射台落成仪式
    赞扬中国人民真心诚意帮助刚果（布）人民
    据新华社布拉柴维尔八日电　刚果（布）总统马桑巴—代巴八日在布拉柴维尔主持了刚果（布）广播电台短波发射台的落成仪式。这个发射台是由中国援助建成的。
    马桑巴—代巴总统在中国驻刚果（布）大使馆临时代办李琛光的陪同下，视察了这座发射台的各种设施。他请中国临时代办向毛泽东主席转达刚果（布）政府和人民的最真挚的谢意。
    马桑巴—代巴总统在仪式上发表讲话时说：“中国给予我们的援助完全是无私的。”他对发射台的工程表示非常满意。他热情赞扬帮助建设这座发射台的中国专家作风好，工作卓有成效，真心诚意帮助刚果（布）人民。
    马桑巴—代巴总统在讲话中谴责帝国主义对中国进行诽谤。他说：“这种诽谤的宣传，决不能使动员起来团结在自己的有崇高威望的领袖毛泽东主席周围的英勇的中国人民退却。”他又说，恰恰相反，这种宣传只会使中国决心把抗击以美国为首的帝国主义的神圣斗争进行到底。
    李琛光临时代办在仪式上讲话时说：“在仅仅不到一年的时间里，这项工程就迅速完成了。这生动地表明，刚果（布）人民是勤劳的人民，他们一旦摆脱了殖民统治，在工作和建设中就充分地发挥出自己的劳动热情和智慧。”他最后说：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，永远是为反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义而斗争的刚果
  （布）人民的可靠朋友。”
