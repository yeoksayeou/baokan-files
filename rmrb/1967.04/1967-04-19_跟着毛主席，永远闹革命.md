Following Chairman Mao, Always Make Revolution

Sun Zhitian, Team Leader of Beijing Dongsheng People's Commune

I watched the color documentary "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts" with tears of excitement. As I watched, I thought: Chairman Mao truly has a heart connected with the people. Look, when Chairman Mao heard the crowd below shouting, "We want to see Chairman Mao!" he, despite his fatigue, walked down from the city gate to the crowd and warmly shook hands with them.

Chairman Mao is truly our confidant. With Chairman Mao at the helm, we will never go astray.

Indeed! If it weren't for Chairman Mao personally initiating and leading this great proletarian cultural revolution, opening my mind, who knows what wrong path I might have taken! In the past, I didn't want to be a cadre, thinking that being a cadre was hard work and didn't pay off. The community members elected me, and I always declined, but since I couldn't refuse, I had to accept. But while serving, I was always thinking about stepping down. After the proletarian cultural revolution began, one time, the commune organized us to visit the Red Guards' exhibition of their achievements. At the exhibition, I saw a large number of gold and silver treasures, plots to overthrow the government, daggers, and pistols collected by landlords and capitalists. At that moment, I was greatly shocked. These guys are still alive but their hearts are not dead; they really want to slaughter us and make us suffer again. How could that be tolerated! Remembering the days before liberation, I worked day and night for the landlord, but still had to go hungry. The evil "Kuomintang" sided with the landlords, oppressing and bullying the poor people. To avoid being drafted, I had to sleep in the cornfield at night. The cornfield was hot and stuffy, and mosquitoes bit me all over, leaving me covered in welts. Those days were truly miserable. After visiting the Red Guards' exhibition, I realized that I shouldn't just think about myself; I should always think about defending our proletarian power and our socialist homeland. Later, when the community members elected me as the team leader, I accepted the task happily without a second thought. I am determined to take on this responsibility and, together with the community members, seize a double harvest of revolution and production.

The number one capitalist-roader in the Party says, "Exploitation saves people" and "Hiring workers to farm is legal." The community members heard this and were so angry they nearly burst. These days, every brigade is holding meetings to denounce his nonsense. Many poor and lower-middle peasants in their fifties and sixties are eager to go on stage to speak. They say, if we follow the words of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party and do things like "three freedoms and one contract," we poor and lower-middle peasants would probably have become the landlords' and capitalists' slaves again, and where would today be? Everyone shouted together: "We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao to make revolution and walk the socialist path! Whoever makes us walk the capitalist path, we will overthrow them!"

After watching the movie, I have so many words to say to Chairman Mao. In a thousand words, a million words, it all comes down to a few sentences: In the future, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's books well, fight hard against the "self," drive the "self" out the door, and let the "public" settle in my mind, and let Mao Zedong Thought take root in my mind.

    跟着毛主席，永远闹革命
    北京东升人民公社生产队队长　孙志田
    我含着激动的热泪，看了彩色纪录影片《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》。我一面看一面想：毛主席跟人民群众真是心连心。你看，当他老人家在天安门上听到下面的群众喊：“我们要见毛主席！”时，他不顾劳累，从城楼上走到群众中间，和群众亲亲热热地握手。
    毛主席真是我们的贴心人。我们有毛主席掌舵，永远不会走错道。
    可不是嘛！要不是毛主席亲自发动和领导这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，给我的脑袋瓜子开了窍，我真不知自己会走到什么邪道儿上去呢！以前，我不想当干部，觉得当干部吃力不讨好。社员们选了我，我总是推，实在推辞不掉，只好当了。可一边当，一边老惦着换肩。无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，有一次，公社组织我们去参观红卫兵战果展览会。在展览会上，我看到地主、资本家收藏的大批金银财宝、变天帐、尖刀、手枪……。当时我大吃一惊，这些家伙可真是人还在，心不死，真要宰我们，还想叫我们受二遍苦呢！那还了得！回想起解放前，我黑天白日地给地主种地，可还是吃了上顿没下顿。万恶的“刮民党”，跟地主一鼻孔出气，处处压迫穷人，欺侮穷人。为了躲避抓壮丁，我夜里只好藏在老玉米地里睡觉。玉米地又闷又热，蚊子咬得浑身净起包，那苦日子真不是人过的。打这次参观红卫兵战果展览会以后，我认识到不该光替自个儿盘算，应该时时刻刻想着保卫我们无产阶级的政权，保卫我们的社会主义江山。后来，社员们选我当生产队长，我二话没说，高高兴兴接受了任务。我决心好好挑这副担子，和社员大伙一起，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺它个革命生产双丰收。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派胡说什么：“剥削是救人”“雇工种地是合法的”。我们公社的社员们听了，肺都快气炸了。各个大队这几天都在开会痛斥他的鬼话。许多五、六十岁的贫下中农争着上台去发言。他们说，照党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的话去做，搞什么“三自一包”，咱们贫下中农恐怕早就又变成地主、资本家的牛马了，哪还有今天？大伙都一齐高呼：“我们要坚决跟着毛主席闹革命，走社会主义道路！”“谁叫我们走资本主义道路，我们就打倒谁！”
    看了电影，我心里真有好多话要向毛主席说。千句话，万句话，归成几句话：今后，我一定要好好读毛主席的书，狠斗“私”字，让“私”字扫地出门，让“公”字在脑子里安家落户，让毛泽东思想在脑子里扎根。
