	Tokyo, April 14 (New China News Agency) – The second issue of the organ of the leftist faction of the Democratic Youth League of Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, "Youth Warrior," published an article by Iwaida Tetsuo. The article calls on Japanese youth to study the "Three Old Articles" diligently, overcome bourgeois individualism, establish the thought of serving the revolution and the people, unite with the broad masses of youth, and vigorously advance the mass struggle.

	The article states, "The thought of the 'Three Old Articles' is our mirror. The 'Three Old Articles' are full of the unyielding, heroic fighting spirit of struggling to the end to overcome all difficulties and sacrifice one's life for the interests of the people. We must study the 'Three Old Articles' deeply. Bourgeois individualism and the thought of serving the people cannot coexist peacefully. Without eliminating bourgeois individualism, it is impossible to establish the lofty thought of the proletariat. A thorough and resolute struggle must be waged against bourgeois individualism."

	The article says, "The leftist faction of the Democratic Youth League of Yamaguchi Prefecture is currently waging a struggle to purge revisionism that has existed in the mass movement and organizational work up to now. For this purpose, each person must first seriously study Marxism-Leninism and reform their thoughts. This is a fierce struggle to smash bourgeois individualism and establish the thought of serving the people."

	The article says, "This fierce struggle to establish the thought of serving the people must be further strengthened and carried through to the end. The leftist faction of the Democratic Youth League of Yamaguchi Prefecture is using the 'Three Old Articles' as a weapon for self-reform of thoughts."

	The article concludes, "All leftist organizations and comrades, let us eliminate bourgeois individualism, establish the thought of serving the revolution and the people! Let us unite with the broad masses of youth and push the mass struggle forward correctly and powerfully!"

    日本《青年战士》发表文章
    号召青年努力学习“老三篇”
    树立为革命为人民服务的思想
    新华社十四日讯　东京消息：日本民主青年同盟山口县委员会（左派）机关杂志《青年战士》第二期刊登了岩田哲雄的一篇文章，号召日本青年努力学习“老三篇”，克服资产阶级个人主义思想，树立为革命和为人民服务思想，团结广大青年，有力地推进群众斗争。
    文章说，“老三篇”的思想是我们的一面镜子。“老三篇”充满着为了人民的利益不惜献出自己的生命、战胜一切困难而斗争到底的不屈的英勇的战斗精神。文章说，我们必须深入地学习“老三篇”。资产阶级个人主义思想和为人民服务的思想决不能和平共处。不扫除资产阶级个人主义思想，就不可能树立无产阶级的崇高思想。对资产阶级个人主义思想，必须进行彻底的、坚决的斗争。
    文章说，日本民主青年同盟山口县委员会（左派）正在进行一场肃清在群众运动和组织工作中迄今存在的修正主义的斗争。为此，首先每个人必须认真地学习马克思列宁主义，改造自己的思想。这是一个大破资产阶级个人主义思想、树立为人民服务的思想的激烈斗争。
    文章说，树立为人民服务的思想这样一场激烈的斗争必须进一步加强并把它进行到底。日本民主青年同盟山口县委员会（左派）正以“老三篇”为武器进行自我思想改造。
    文章最后说：“一切左派组织和全体同志们，让我们消灭资产阶级个人主义思想，树立为革命为人民服务的思想吧！让我们同广大青年团结起来，把群众斗争正确地强有力地推向前进！”
