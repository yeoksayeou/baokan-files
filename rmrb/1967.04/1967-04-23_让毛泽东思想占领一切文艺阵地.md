Chairman Mao has taught us: "We must make literature and art a component of the entire revolutionary machine, a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, to help the people unite as one and fight against the enemy."

Currently, a thorough criticism of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party is surging across the nation. In this great criticism, we workers, peasants, and soldiers in the literary and artistic field, as well as revolutionary literary and artistic workers, must hoist high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take up the weapons of revolutionary literature and art, and launch a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party! The mass performances of workers, peasants, and soldiers organized by the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries on the streets have set a good example in this regard.

"The proletarian revolutionaries must shout loudly on the revolutionary political stage and sing and dance loudly on the revolutionary cultural stage." This is the bold declaration of the Shanghai workers, peasants, and soldiers' cultural army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and it is also the glorious political mission that all comrades on the cultural and artistic front should undertake.

Over the past decade since the founding of the nation, a thick and long line of revisionist literature and art has existed in the literary and artistic field. The number one capitalist-roader within the Party is the chief backer of this black line. Under the support of this chief backer, a handful of revisionists led by Luo Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and Xia Yan have stubbornly opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, spreading the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism in the literary and artistic field, and paving the way for the restoration of capitalism.

In 1964, Chairman Mao pointed out the serious situation in the literary and artistic circles: Over the past fifteen years, basically (not everyone) the Party's policy has not been executed, officials have become lords, and there has been no approach to workers, peasants, and soldiers, nor has there been a reflection of the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, it has even fallen to the brink of revisionism. If it is not seriously reformed, it will inevitably become a group like the Petofi Club in Hungary on some future day.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the broad revolutionary masses and the proletarian revolutionaries in the literary and artistic circles have launched a fierce attack on the revisionist literary and artistic black line. The ugly faces of a handful of revisionists in the literary and artistic circles have been exposed nakedly under the bright sunlight and are surrounded by the broad revolutionary masses.

In the current stage of the proletarian revolutionaries' united seizure of power, we must not only seize back the power of party, government, finance, and culture from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, but we must also seize back the power of the "cultural stage." Let workers, peasants, and soldiers occupy the cultural stage, and let the invincible red flag of Mao Zedong Thought be planted on every front.

Revolutionary literary and artistic warriors, we must hoist high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a thorough criticism of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and combine this criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of the local and unit. We must thoroughly eliminate their poison in the literary and artistic field. At the same time, we must actively create modern, revolutionary, and combat-ready literary and artistic works and programs that serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and go deep into factories, rural areas, military units, and schools, and onto the streets, to occupy the broadest cultural stage, to propagate and perform for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to inspire them to criticize and fight, to make Mao Zedong Thought penetrate deeper into people's hearts, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Chairman Mao said: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." As long as we resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line and thoroughly eliminate the revisionist literary and artistic black line, the socialist cultural stage will definitely shine with revolutionary brilliance!

    让毛泽东思想占领一切文艺阵地
    本报评论员
    毛主席教导我们：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”
      当前，一个彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的群众运动，正在全国范围内汹涌澎湃地展开。在这场大批判中，我们工农兵文艺战士和革命的文艺工作者，都应当高举毛泽东思想的战斗旗帜，拿起革命的文艺武器，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火！上海无产阶级革命派举办的工农兵文艺会演在街头演出，在这方面为我们做出了好榜样。
      “无产阶级革命派要在革命的政治舞台上大喊大叫，也要在革命的文艺舞台上大唱大跳。”——这是用毛泽东思想武装起来的上海工农兵文艺大军的豪言壮语，也是所有文化艺术战线上的同志们应该肩负的光荣的政治任务。
    建国十几年来，文艺领域里存在着一条又粗又长的修正主义文艺黑线。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，就是这条黑线的总后台。在这个总后台的支持下，以陆定一、周扬、夏衍为首的一小撮修正主义分子，顽固地对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线，在文艺领域里大肆散布封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的毒素，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。
    在一九六四年，毛主席针对文艺界的这些严重状况指出：十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。
    在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大的革命群众和文艺界的无产阶级革命派，向修正主义的文艺黑线发起了猛烈的进攻。文艺界一小撮修正主义分子的丑恶面貌，已经赤裸裸地暴露在光天化日之下，陷于广大革命群众的重重包围之中。
    在当前无产阶级革命派联合夺权的阶段中，我们不仅要从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺回党、政、财、文大权，而且还必须夺回“文艺舞台”的权。让工农兵去占领文艺舞台，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍每一个阵地。
    革命的文艺战士们，我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，展开对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，并把这一批判和本地区、本单位的斗批改结合起来，彻底清除他们在文艺领域中的流毒。同时，要积极创作现代的、革命化战斗化的、为工农兵服务的文艺作品和文艺节目，深入工厂、农村、部队、学校，走上街头，占领最广阔的文艺舞台，向广大工农兵群众进行宣传和演出，鼓舞他们去批判，去战斗，使毛泽东思想更加深入人心，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席说：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”只要我们坚决执行毛主席的革命文艺路线，彻底铲除修正主义文艺黑线，社会主义的文艺舞台就一定能够大放革命的光采！
