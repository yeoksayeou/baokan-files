U.S. imperialism, in an attempt to salvage its failing aggression in Vietnam, has recently escalated the war while simultaneously pushing a "peace talk" charade, continuing its plot of "forcing surrender through war." While the Johnson administration convened its gang of accomplices in Washington to plot further escalation of the war, the U.S. State Department on the 19th proposed the so-called "expansion of the demilitarized zone by ten miles to the south and north." The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has firmly opposed and strongly condemned this trick by U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people fully support the just stance of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

This so-called "proposal" by U.S. imperialism is a wicked and sinister plot.

U.S. imperialism has long since torn up the 1954 Geneva Accords, not only launching an invasion of South Vietnam but also expanding the war to the demilitarized zone and North Vietnam, completely destroying the regulations of the demilitarized zone and the temporary demarcation line. Now, why does U.S. imperialism suddenly start talking about the demilitarized zone again and even propose to expand it?

After expanding the war to the demilitarized zone, U.S. imperialism has brutally ravaged the southern part of the demilitarized zone and shelled the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from the south, committing heinous crimes. To punish the aggressors, the liberation armed forces in South Vietnam have shown great prowess, launching multiple successful attacks in the areas south of the demilitarized zone, striking fear and chaos into the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys. The military and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have also dealt heavy blows to the aggressors who shelled North Vietnam. Now, the U.S. imperialists' demand to expand the demilitarized zone, creating a vast no-man's-land, is precisely to stabilize their failing situation south of the demilitarized zone, while using this cunning proposal to cover up their plot to further escalate the war in South and North Vietnam.

However, no matter what plots and tricks U.S. imperialism plays, it will absolutely not deceive the Vietnamese people and will not save its shameful failure in the Vietnam War. The U.S. aggressors have only one way out: to get out of South Vietnam.

### 粉碎美帝所谓扩大非军事区的阴谋

    粉碎美帝所谓扩大非军事区的阴谋
    美帝国主义为了挽救它侵越战争的失败，最近一面疯狂扩大战争，一面大搞“和谈”骗局，继续推行它的“以战迫降”的阴谋。就在约翰逊政府召集它的一伙帮凶走卒在华盛顿策划进一步扩大战争的步骤的同时，美国国务院在十九日提出所谓“非军事区南部和北部各扩大十英里”的建议。越南民主共和国政府坚决反对和强烈谴责美帝国主义的这个鬼花招。中国人民完全支持越南民主共和国政府的严正立场。
    美帝国主义的这个所谓“建议”，是一个用心险恶的大阴谋。
    美帝国主义早就撕毁了一九五四年的日内瓦协议，不但发动了侵略南越的战争，而且把战争扩大到非军事区和越南北方，彻底破坏了非军事区和临时分界线的规定。现在，美帝国主义为什么忽然又大谈起非军事区来，并且还要扩大非军事区呢？
    美帝国主义在把战争扩大到非军事区以后，穷凶极恶地蹂躏非军事区南部，并且从非军事区以南炮击越南民主共和国，犯下了滔天罪行。为了惩罚侵略者，越南南方解放武装力量大显神威，在非军事区以南地区发动了多次胜利的袭击，把美帝国主义及其走狗打得惊慌失措，狼狈不堪。越南民主共和国军民也给了炮击越南北方的侵略者以沉重的打击。美帝国主义现在要求扩大非军事区，制造一个广阔的无人地带，正是为了稳定它在非军事区以南的败局，同时用这种狡诈的建议来掩盖它在越南南方和北方进一步扩大战争的阴谋。
    但是，不管美帝国主义玩弄什么阴谋诡计，都绝对欺骗不了越南人民，挽救不了它侵越战争的可耻失败。美国侵略者只有一条路：从越南南方滚出去。
