Massive Revolutionary Gatherings and Demonstrations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Harbin
Raising the Banner of Revolutionary Criticism to Uproot the Root of Revisionism
Broad Masses of Workers, Peasants, Soldiers, Red Guards, Revolutionary Students, and Revolutionary Cadres Cheer the Publication of "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?" in "Red Flag," Determined to Uproot the Poisonous Weed of "On Cultivation," Eliminate Its Harmful Influence, and Carry the Cultural Revolution Through to the End!

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on April 1, revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, PLA soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary students and teachers in the capital, who are fighting at the side of the great leader Chairman Mao, were filled with boundless loyalty and love for the red sun in their hearts, Chairman Mao, after reading the article "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?" in "Red Flag." They enthusiastically cheered the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and made the most resolute and loudest vow: They will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, organize a vast army of cultural revolutionaries, resolutely overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, uproot the root of revisionism in our country, overthrow personal careerists and conspirators like Khrushchev, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and ensure that our socialist state will never change color for ten thousand generations!

Revolutionary workers in the capital enthusiastically cheered: The article "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?" in "Red Flag" is excellent! Many revolutionary workers, after finishing their shifts, took to the streets and gathered at Tiananmen Square to march and demonstrate. The marching revolutionary workers angrily shouted, "Overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party!" "Thoroughly criticize 'On Cultivation'!" In many factories, a revolutionary atmosphere of battle prevailed. Some standing committee members of the Beijing Workers' Congress said: The article "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?" thoroughly exposed the ugly face of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, hitting the target accurately and fiercely! We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely repel the counterrevolutionary tide of capitalist restoration, resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Workers of the Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory said: This article speaks the mind of the working class. We workers hate the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party to the core and will definitely overthrow them and make sure they never rise again!

Peasants from the South Gao Production Brigade of the Beijing Suburbs Friendship People's Commune were filled with indignation after hearing "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?" on the radio. They said: Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao, whoever dares to oppose the great Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely fight to the end. The Party branch secretary of this production brigade excitedly said: We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, take immediate action, bravely join the battle, and thoroughly eliminate the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line in the countryside.

Red Guards and revolutionary students from universities in the capital also took to the streets, posting big-character posters, expressing their determination to overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. Red Guard fighters said: The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party is the root of revisionism. We Red Guards will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and sweep all the Chinese Khrushchevs into the dustbin of history. We will thoroughly criticize all the black goods of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party.

More than ten thousand revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the new Beijing University held a rally. Many representatives of the fighting teams pointed out in their speeches that the article "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?" is the signal for a general offensive against the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. It has sentenced the bourgeois reactionary line to death, greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary proletarian faction, and greatly dampened the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. At the meeting held by the Red Revolutionary Committee of the New Beijing University Commune to criticize "On Cultivation," a representative of the "Defend the East at All Costs" combat team of the Political and Legal Department, which initiated the criticism of "On Cultivation," pointed out in his speech that "On Cultivation" was republished in 1962 as part of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party's attempt to seize the Party, the army, and the government, and to prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism in China. It must be thoroughly criticized. Many revolutionary teachers and students expressed that it is an important combat mission to thoroughly criticize "On Cultivation" politically, theoretically, and ideologically, to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line.

The Jingan Mountain Corps of Tsinghua University specially held a meeting to criticize "On Cultivation." The fighters of the Jingan Mountain Corps said: We fighters of the Jingan Mountain Corps of Tsinghua University and all revolutionary teachers, students, and staff will definitely fight bravely, overthrow and criticize the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party! Thoroughly criticize "On Cultivation," this big poisonous weed against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly eliminate its harmful influence.

More than six thousand revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Beijing Normal University held a rally this morning. The leader of the Jingan Mountain Commune said: We all revolutionary teachers and students must unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight together, and fire fiercely at the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. In the struggle, we must follow Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must remember Chairman Mao's instruction: To implement Marx's teaching that only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself. Resolutely strike down a small handful, unite the majority, and correctly implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres.

The Red Flag Combat Team General Service Station of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics today called on all fighters to immediately launch a high tide of criticism against the bourgeois reactionary line on the issue of cadres and criticism of "On Cultivation"!

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on April 1, revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the three military forces stationed in Shanghai held demonstrations, parades, or discussion meetings today, enthusiastically cheering the publication of the important article "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?" in the fifth issue of "Red Flag." The revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the military fighters believe that the publication of this important article has sounded the signal for a general offensive against the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, marking the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new and deeper stage. This is another great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Today, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shanghai, with the majestic momentum of "a million heroes crossing the Yangtze River," held a grand demonstration. From early morning, columns of marching troops gathered from schools, offices, and factories onto the streets, marching towards the location of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. They held high red flags, surrounded by giant portraits of Chairman Mao, held the radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and continuously shouted: "Resolutely overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and make him step down!" "Thoroughly criticize the big poisonous weed against Mao Zedong Thought, 'On Cultivation'!" "Defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to the death!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" The powerful demonstration fully expressed the Shanghai revolutionary masses' contempt and hatred for a small handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists and the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party who support them, and their boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought!

Red Guards and revolutionary students from Tongji University and Jiaotong University propagated the important article "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?" while marching. Propaganda vehicles continuously broadcast articles criticizing the big poisonous weed "On Cultivation." Red Guards and revolutionary students from Tongji University excitedly said: Our red sun in the heart, Chairman Mao, has always supported the revolutionary masses' movements and actively encouraged "little people" to rebel against "big people." Since liberation, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party has attempted to collude with the bourgeoisie to snatch the fruits of victory from the people, which is simply a pipe dream! They said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Dare to sacrifice oneself, dare to pull the emperor off his horse." We Red Guards have already made up our minds to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm ourselves, criticize and denounce the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, and ensure that the socialist state will never change color.

Revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants from Jiangwan Commune in Baoshan County said: The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party has tried every means to restore capitalism, hyping up the treacherous film "The Last Emperor" as a patriotic film, aiming to create public opinion for capitalist restoration. In the early days of liberation, he loudly advocated "long-term protection of the rich peasant economy," and in recent years, he advocated "three selfs and one contract," spreading the wind of individual farming, aiming to destroy the people's commune. He is the chief culprit and the root of the attempt to restore capitalism. Socialism is our lifeline. If capitalism is restored, we will suffer again. A small handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists within the Party and the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party who support them want to drag us onto the capitalist road. We poor and lower-middle peasants will never allow it, not in a thousand ways, not in ten thousand ways.

Revolutionary workers from the Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory and other factories refuted the various fallacies of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party with their personal experiences. They angrily said, the history of the capitalists' rise is the history of our workers' blood and tears. But the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party said, "China is not too capitalist, but too little capitalist," "the working people do not oppose exploitation, but welcome it," which is extremely reactionary. Where is there any trace of a Communist Party member in him!

Revolutionary cadres of the Huangpu District Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai said, the publication of the article "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?" has sounded the call to arms for a general offensive against the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. To ensure that our socialist motherland will never change color, to defend the great Mao Zedong Thought, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must overthrow a small handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists, criticize and denounce the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, pull them down from their horses, and make them step down.

Fighters of the East China Fleet listened to the radio, studied the article "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?", and held a discussion, strongly condemning the various crimes of a small handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists and the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party who support them.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Harbin on April 1, 200,000 revolutionary masses and military fighters in Harbin held a massive oath-taking rally and demonstration today, expressing their determination to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, and criticize and denounce them.

The mood of the participants in the oath-taking rally and demonstration was indignant, and their fighting spirit was high. They carried giant portraits of Chairman Mao, waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red" and "The Great Ship Sails on the Sea," and repeatedly raised their arms to shout: "Resolutely smash the bourgeois reactionary line!" "Overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party!" "Defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to the death!" "Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the boundless Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

Representatives of workers, peasants, PLA soldiers, students, and revolutionary cadres at the meeting, with great indignation, exposed the crimes of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, who has always opposed Chairman Mao, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, pushed the counterrevolutionary revisionist line, launched a full-scale savage attack on the proletariat, and sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, follow the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and, as the saying goes, "pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage," thoroughly criticize and eliminate the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party in all aspects.

Comrade Pan Fusheng, the chairman of the Heilongjiang Revolutionary Committee, said in his speech: When our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victory nationwide, and the bourgeois reactionary line has completely collapsed, the broad masses of the revolutionary proletariat have dug out the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! We shout long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

Comrade Pan Fusheng said: The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party has always opposed Chairman Mao, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and pushed a counterrevolutionary revisionist line, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He and another biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party colluded, acting in cahoots, proposing and firmly pushing a bourgeois reactionary line, attempting to restore capitalism in China. They are not old revolutionaries but false revolutionaries, counterrevolutionaries, the biggest revisionists in China, the total representative of reactionary forces in China, and the Khrushchev sleeping by our side.

After talking about the great victory of the struggle for power by the red rebels in Heilongjiang Province against a small handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, Comrade Pan Fusheng stressed that it must be seen that the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is still very intense at present. We must raise our revolutionary vigilance, take the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines as the key link, clearly analyze the current class struggle situation, and never be complacent or negligent because of the great victory in the struggle for power. We must always repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line and strike down the counterrevolutionary tide of capitalist restoration.

Comrade Pan Fusheng finally said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "'Dare to sacrifice oneself, dare to pull the emperor off his horse,' when we fight for socialism and communism, we must have this fearless spirit." Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a comprehensive class struggle, thoroughly, deeply, and comprehensively criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminate all its influences and effects, resolutely overthrow the black root of the bourgeois reactionary line, criticize and denounce the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought be planted all over China and all over the world!

A worker representative said at the meeting: We workers have long been unable to tolerate the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party opposing Chairman Mao, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and pushing the counterrevolutionary revisionist line. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely criticize and denounce them. A military representative said: The People's Liberation Army of China is a people's army created by Chairman Mao. We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Attending the meeting were also the commander of the Heilongjiang Military Region, deputy chairman of the Heilongjiang Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Wang Jiadao, and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations.

    据新华社上海一日电　上海广大无产阶级革命派和驻沪三军今天纷纷举行示威游行或座谈会，热烈欢呼《红旗》杂志第五期发表了《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》这篇重要文章。广大无产阶级革命派和部队指战员认为，这篇重要文章的发表，吹响了向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的进军号，标志着无产阶级文化大革命发展到了一个新的更加深入的阶段，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想又一个新的重大胜利！
    今天，上海无产阶级革命派以“百万雄师过大江”的雄壮气势，举行了声势浩大的示威游行。从清晨起，一支支游行大军陆续从学校、机关、工厂汇集到街头，向上海市革命委员会所在地行进。他们高举红旗，簇拥着毛主席的巨幅画像，举起红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，不断高呼：“坚决把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派拉下马，让他靠边站！”“彻底批判反毛泽东思想的大毒草《论修养》！”“誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！”“伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”强大的示威游行，充分表达了上海无产阶级革命派对一小撮反革命修正主义分子和支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派无比蔑视，无比仇恨，对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜！

    宝山县江湾公社的革命贫下中农说：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，千方百计想搞资本主义复辟，硬要把《清宫秘史》这部卖国主义的影片，吹捧成爱国主义影片，就是要为资本主义复辟制造舆论。解放初期，他大肆叫嚷“长期保护富农经济”，前几年又鼓吹“三自一包”，刮起单干风，要搞垮人民公社，他是妄图复辟资本主义的罪魁祸首和总根子。社会主义是我们的命根子，资本主义一复辟，我们就会再吃二遍苦。党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子和支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，妄想把我们拉向资本主义道路，我们贫下中农绝不答应，一千个办不到，一万个办不到。
    上海玻璃机械厂等工厂的革命工人，以亲身经历，严词驳斥了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的种种谬论。他们愤怒地说，资本家的发家史就是我们工人的血泪史。可是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却胡说什么“中国不是资本主义太多了，而是资本主义太少了”，“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削”，真是反动透顶，他那里有一点共产党员的气息！

    东海舰队的指战员收听了广播，学习了《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》这篇文章，进行了座谈，愤怒谴责了一小撮反革命修正主义分子和支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的种种罪行。
    据新华社哈尔滨一日电　哈尔滨市二十万革命群众和驻军指战员，今天举行了规模巨大的誓师大会和游行示威，表示要坚决地、全面地、彻底地批判资产阶级反动路线，坚决把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派拉下马，把他们批倒、斗臭。
    参加誓师大会和游行示威的队伍，群情激愤，斗志昂扬。他们抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，挥舞着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌曲，不断振臂高呼：“坚决粉碎资产阶级反动路线！”“打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派！”“誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！”“无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“光焰无际的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    参加大会的工人、农民、解放军、学生、革命干部等代表，怀着无比愤慨的心情，揭露党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一贯反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，推行反革命修正主义，向无产阶级发动全面性的猖狂进攻，以及破坏无产阶级文化大革命等种种反革命罪行。他们表示，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，高举革命的批判的旗帜，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，“宜将剩勇追穷寇”，彻底批判和肃清以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线在各方面的流毒。
    黑龙江省革命委员会主任委员潘复生同志在讲话中说：当我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命在全国已经取得伟大胜利，资产阶级反动路线全面崩溃的时候，广大的无产阶级革命派把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派挖了出来，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！我们高呼毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    潘复生同志说：党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派一贯反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，推行了一条反革命修正主义路线，与毛主席的无产阶级革命路线相对抗。他和党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派串通一气，狼狈为奸，提出并坚决推行了一条资产阶级反动路线，企图在中国实现资本主义复辟。他们不是老革命，而是假革命，反革命，是中国最大的修正主义分子，是中国反动势力的总代表，是睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫。
    潘复生同志在谈到黑龙江省红色造反者向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争取得伟大胜利以后，强调指出，必须看到，当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争还十分激烈。我们务必要提高革命的警惕性，以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，清醒地分析当前的阶级斗争形势，绝不可因为取得夺权斗争的伟大胜利而麻痹大意，掉以轻心。必须随时击退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，痛击资本主义复辟的反革命逆流。
    潘复生同志最后说：毛主席教导我们：“‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’，我们在为社会主义共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有这种大无畏的精神。”让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，展开全面的阶级斗争，全面、彻底、深入地批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清其一切流毒和影响，坚决把资产阶级反动路线的黑根子挖出来，把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派批倒、斗臭，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全中国，插遍全世界！
    工人代表在会上说：我们工人阶级对党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想，推行反革命修正主义，早就忍无可忍了。谁反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想，我们就坚决把他批倒、斗臭。解放军代表说：中国人民解放军，是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，我们永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    出席大会的还有黑龙江省军区司令员、黑龙江省革命委员会副主任委员汪家道和革命群众组织的负责人。
    誓师大会后，革命群众和驻军指战员，举行了声势浩大的示威游行。
