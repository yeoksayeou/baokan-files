The Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee Delegation today issued a statement regarding the Soviet government's expulsion of Comrade Suarso Suroso. The statement points out that this expulsion incident once again reveals the betrayal of proletarian internationalism by the Soviet Communist Party leadership, which is currently the center of modern revisionism.

The statement says that despite Brezhnev, one of the leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique, expressing "support" for Indonesian revolutionaries, especially Indonesian Communist Party members, in his report to the 23rd Congress of the CPSU, the facts show that they have adopted a hypocritical and betraying attitude towards the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people, led by the Indonesian Communist Party, to overthrow the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime.

The statement says that the Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee Delegation fully supports and endorses Comrade Suarso Suroso's statement made on February 20, 1967, in Beijing, and emphasizes the dangerous nature of the criminal activities carried out by modern revisionists centered around the CPSU leadership. They are more cunningly implementing Khrushchev's various policies, openly sabotaging the revolutionary movement of the Indonesian people, and splitting the progressive forces of Indonesia, especially the Indonesian Communist Party. The statement condemns the modern revisionists centered around the CPSU leadership for openly colluding with the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, which is even more brutal than Hitler, through economic and military aid, and for expelling Indonesian Communist Party members from the Soviet Union. The statement says that such disgraceful actions by the Soviet revisionists make us understand even more that in the struggle against modern revisionists, taking a neutral stance is absolutely impossible, and the attitude repeatedly expressed by the Communist Party of China, the Albanian Party of Labor, and other Marxist-Leninist parties is how correct it is. This attitude is that the struggle against imperialism led by American imperialism and the struggle against modern revisionism led by the CPSU leadership cannot be separated.

The statement says that the Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee Delegation expresses its gratitude to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for the great help provided on the basis of proletarian internationalism, which enabled Comrade Suarso Suroso to safely arrive in China—the base of the world revolution and the strongest fortress in the struggle against imperialism led by American imperialism, against modern revisionism centered around the CPSU leadership, and against the reactionaries of various countries.

    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会代表团发表声明
    谴责苏修破坏印尼革命的背叛行径
    苏修同残暴的印尼法西斯政权已勾结在一起
    新华社十九日讯　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会代表团今天发表关于苏联政府驱逐苏阿尔·苏罗梭同志的声明。声明指出，这一驱逐事件再一次表明目前作为现代修正主义者的中心的苏共领导集团对无产阶级国际主义的背叛。
    声明说，苏修统治集团的头目之一勃列日涅夫尽管在苏共二十三大的报告中对印度尼西亚革命者，特别是对印度尼西亚共产党人表示“声援”，但事实表明，他们对在印度尼西亚共产党领导下，印度尼西亚人民为推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军事政权的革命斗争采取了伪善和背叛的态度。
    声明说，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会代表团肯定并支持苏阿尔·苏罗梭同志一九六七年二月二十日在北京发表的声明，并强调指出以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者所进行的罪恶活动的危险性，他们更狡猾地推行赫鲁晓夫的各种政策，明目张胆地破坏印度尼西亚人民的革命运动和分裂印度尼西亚人民的进步力量，特别是印度尼西亚共产党。声明谴责以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者通过经济和军事援助公开地同比希特勒更为残暴的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军事政权勾结在一起，并且把印度尼西亚共产党人从苏联驱逐出境。声明说，苏修这种可耻的行径使我们更加懂得，在反对现代修正主义者的斗争中，采取中立的态度是万万不可能的，而中国共产党，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和其他马克思列宁主义的党一再表明的态度是多么正确，这个态度就是反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的斗争同反对以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义的斗争是不能分割的。
    声明说，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会代表团向中国共产党中央委员会表示感谢，感谢他们在无产阶级国际主义的基础上所提供的巨大帮助，使苏阿尔·苏罗梭同志平安地抵达中国——世界革命的根据地和在反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义，反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和反对各国反动派的斗争中不可战胜的最强大的堡垒。
