Kunming and Fuzhou revolutionary masses hold rallies and demonstrations

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 29th, over 50,000 revolutionary masses from various circles in Kunming City and Yunnan Province, as well as returned overseas Chinese, held a large-scale rally and demonstration today to angrily denounce the Indonesian reactionaries for instigating an anti-China and anti-Chinese wave, further damaging relations between the two countries.

Yunnan Province and Kunming City's revolutionary masses from various ethnic groups held a grand rally and demonstration this afternoon. The denunciation meeting was filled with a strong revolutionary atmosphere. Speakers at the meeting pointed out that the Suharto-Nasution rightist military clique, which is anti-communist and anti-people domestically, and pro-American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism internationally, is acting in a retrograde and reactionary manner. They have made China, which has consistently supported the Indonesian people's anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles, into an enemy, and have made overseas Chinese, who have shed blood and sweat for Indonesia's national independence and economic construction, into enemies. They are doing everything they can to damage relations between China and Indonesia. The Indonesian reactionary government has done so many evil deeds that it will inevitably spark a broader and more intense revolution among the Indonesian people. It will also provoke more resolute resistance from the overseas Chinese. A new revolutionary high tide will surely come to Indonesia, and the great Indonesian people will ultimately overthrow the dark rule of imperialism and its running dogs, the Indonesian reactionaries. After the meeting, a grand demonstration was held.

Approximately 30,000 revolutionary masses from various circles in Fujian Province and Fuzhou City held a rally this afternoon in Fuzhou City. The people expressed their resolute support for the Indonesian overseas Chinese in their just struggle against the brutal persecution by the Indonesian reactionaries and enthusiastically praised the overseas Chinese's struggle against persecution, which has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of the Indonesian reactionaries. Two representatives of returned Indonesian overseas Chinese spoke at the meeting: "Our country's statement is a powerful response by 700 million Chinese people to the Indonesian reactionaries' mad provocations. It is a firm support for the patriotic Indonesian overseas Chinese and the Indonesian revolutionary people. We will always stand with the Indonesian people and the patriotic Indonesian overseas Chinese. We resolutely support their struggle." Revolutionary workers, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres who spoke at the meeting expressed their determination to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions on "seizing the revolution and promoting production and preparedness" and to thoroughly implement the strategic policy of "being prepared for war, prepared for famine, and serving the people." They will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and better support the just struggle of the Indonesian people and the Indonesian overseas Chinese.
