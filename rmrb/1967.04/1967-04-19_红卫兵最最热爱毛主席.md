The Red Guards Love Chairman Mao the Most

By Lu Yancai
Guard of Tiananmen Gate

When watching the large-scale color documentary "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts," my heart was beating intensely with the young Red Guards in the film. I was shouting with them, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!"

We are the soldiers guarding Tiananmen Gate and have witnessed the touching scenes of the Red Guards loving Chairman Mao. All rivers flow into the sea, and all red hearts turn to the sun. After the revolutionary linking-up began, the young Red Guards from all over the country came to Tiananmen Square in Beijing from all directions to receive Chairman Mao's inspection and to exchange experiences of the Cultural Revolution. I remember the day before Chairman Mao's second inspection of the Red Guards, many Red Guards from outside Beijing were already waiting at Tiananmen Square. It was cold at night, and I advised them to go to the reception center to rest and come back the next day, but they replied, "We are eager to see Chairman Mao, and our hearts are warm, we don't feel cold at all." Another day, just after dawn, a Red Guard ran over to wash her hair with the water from the pipes at Tiananmen Square. I saw that the water was cold and advised her not to wash, but she happily said, "The water at Tiananmen Square is the water by Chairman Mao's side, it is the sweetest and has the best anti-poison effect. Washing with it will never lose direction in the great waves of class struggle." After Chairman Mao's fourth inspection of over a hundred thousand revolutionary masses, many Red Guards touched and touched the places where Chairman Mao had sat and walked. Many Red Guards, when leaving Beijing to return home, came to Tiananmen Square to salute Chairman Mao's giant portrait. They said with tears of excitement, "Tiananmen, goodbye! Chairman Mao, goodbye!"

With the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's Red Guards have grown and become stronger in the struggle. In every stage of the Cultural Revolution, they have always followed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, charging forward, and have made immortal contributions to the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Their direction has always been correct.

However, at present, there is a counter-revolutionary restorationist current in society. A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are trying to impose the responsibility of "overthrowing everything and excluding everything" on the Red Guards, which is unacceptable. We, the sentries at Tiananmen Gate and the guards by Chairman Mao's side, firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call, actively support the revolutionary leftists, and are determined to be the strong backing of the Red Guards. We will fight together with the Red Guards and with the broad revolutionary masses, and we will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    红卫兵最最热爱毛主席
    天安门警卫战士　卢燕财
    看着大型彩色纪录片《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》的时候，我的心一直在和影片中的红卫兵小将们一起激烈地跳动，我一直在和红卫兵小将们一起欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    我们是守卫天安门的战士，亲眼见过红卫兵热爱毛主席的动人情景。条条江河归大海，颗颗红心向太阳。革命大串连开始后，天南海北的红卫兵小将们，从祖国的四面八方来到北京的天安门前，接受毛主席的检阅，交流文化大革命的经验。我记得去年毛主席第二次接见红卫兵小将的前一天晚上，就有好多外地来的红卫兵在天安门前等候。夜里天气很凉，我劝他们先到接待站去休息休息，明天再来，他们却回答说：“我们一心想见毛主席，心里暖和着哩，一点也不感到冷。”另外还有一天，天刚亮，就有一个红卫兵跑来用天安门前水管子里的水洗头。我见水很冷，劝她不要洗，可是她却高兴地说：“天安门前的水，是毛主席身旁的水，它最甜、最有抗毒作用，用它洗了头，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里永远也不会迷失方向。”毛主席第四次接见一百多万革命群众之后，有许多红卫兵小将们在毛主席坐过的地方，走过的地方，摸啊，摸啊……。许多红卫兵小将在离开北京回家的时候，还来到天安门前，向毛主席的巨幅画像敬礼。他们含着激动的泪花说：“天安门，再见了！毛主席，再见了！”
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，毛主席的红卫兵小将们在斗争中成长壮大了。在文化大革命的各个阶段，他们都沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，冲锋在前，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利立下了不朽的功勋，他们的大方向始终是正确的。
    可是，目前在社会上出现了一股反革命复辟的逆流。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派企图把“打倒一切、排斥一切”的罪责强加在红卫兵小将头上，这是办不到的。我们天安门前的哨兵，毛主席身旁的警卫战士，最坚决地响应毛主席的伟大号召，积极支持革命左派，誓做红卫兵小将的坚强后盾。我们决心和红卫兵小将战斗在一起，和广大革命群众战斗在一起，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
