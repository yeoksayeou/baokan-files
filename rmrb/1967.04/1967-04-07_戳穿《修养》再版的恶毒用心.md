Edition: 2

Chairman Mao has said: "To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion, first do work in the ideological sphere. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counterrevolutionary class is also like this."

Just in 1962, when the class struggle at home and abroad was extremely sharp, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, revised and reprinted his "On Cultivation," flooding the domestic and international scenes. He directed the spearhead of his attack straight at our great leader Chairman Mao. The number one capitalist-roader in the Party, in his revised and reprinted "On Cultivation," said at the outset: "I want to talk about the problem of the cultivation of Communist Party members. Now to talk about this problem is not without benefit for the Party's construction and consolidation." The two words "now" are not in the original version. These two meaningful words revealed the secret, so in criticizing "On Cultivation," we cannot separate it from the historical conditions of 1962, we cannot separate it from the class struggle at home and abroad in 1962.

In "On Cultivation," the number one capitalist-roader in the Party's slander and attack on Chairman Mao are extremely rampant and extremely malicious, and his methods are extremely treacherous and extremely despicable. Just as Marx said: "If he is ignorant in theory, he is quite skillful in intrigue."

Let us tear off the mask of "On Cultivation," expose his tricks, and reveal his hideous face in broad daylight.

Frantically Opposing Our Great Leader Chairman Mao

In 1960, Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, issued the great call to "Study Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." The people of the entire country responded enthusiastically, launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating people's hearts. Comrade Lin Biao's call touched a sore spot with the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, who hated it to the core and openly resisted. In the reprinted "On Cultivation," the number one capitalist-roader in the Party said with ulterior motives: "To be a good student of Marx and Lenin." We know that Chairman Mao has raised Marxism-Leninism to a new level, Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and the greatest proletarian revolutionary of our time. To be a "good student of Marx and Lenin," one must be a good student of Chairman Mao. Here, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party is not at all advocating that people be good students of Marx and Lenin, but is using this to oppose Comrade Lin Biao's great call to "be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." At the same time, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, during the time when Khrushchev was fiercely attacking Stalin, deleted the name of Stalin. This was openly colluding with the Soviet revisionists to attack Stalin and to attack the Chinese Communist Party's correct evaluation of Stalin.

In this long and stinking "On Cultivation" of over 48,000 words, he did not mention the most crucial issue of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in his so-called nine aspects of a Party member's cultivation. Even more malicious is that he quoted Chairman Mao's sayings, some of which were forced in, and some of which were using the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, openly opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

The number one capitalist-roader in the Party, while vigorously denigrating Chairman Mao, shamelessly praised himself as a "Party member with no personal motives, completely loyal to the Party, who has high communist morality, and the greatest courage," claiming that "his work, no matter how many years later it is checked, has no actions that do not conform to the interests of the Party." He arrogantly claimed to be the highest judge of Marxism-Leninism, boasting that he would "verify all theories." He was truly audacious, not knowing the meaning of the word "shame." In 1949, he boasted in Tianjin's Dongya Cotton Mill: "Now in China, if not number one, then number two."

This number one capitalist-roader in the Party used such tricks of denigration and elevation to try every means to denigrate Chairman Mao and elevate himself, attempting to create public opinion for his usurpation of the Party, the army, and the government, and to realize the restoration of capitalism.

Frantically Defaming Mao Zedong Thought

As early as 1957, in his speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Under the current situation, revisionism is more harmful than dogmatism. One of the important tasks on our ideological front now is to launch a criticism of revisionism." In 1962, when the revisionist trend of thought was rampant both domestically and internationally, the reprinted "On Cultivation" not only did not mention opposing revisionism, but instead resonated with the modern revisionist group centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership, singing in unison, fiercely attacking the so-called "leftist opportunism," fiercely attacking "intra-party excessive struggle," fiercely attacking "dogmatism," and fiercely attacking Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. In the 1949 version of "On Cultivation," when attacking "dogmatists," he said: "Such people have been quite numerous in the Chinese Communist Party. The worst representatives among them are even worse than the above situation.... But can we confidently say that there are no such people in our Party? We cannot say that." In the 1962 reprint, he made the following important revisions: "Such people have been quite numerous in the Chinese Communist Party. In a certain period in the past, some representatives of dogmatism were even worse than the above situation.... But can we confidently say that there will be no such people in our Party from now on? We cannot say that."

The two revisions are sinister and have a target. In 1962, who attacked the Chinese Communist Party, which held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, as "dogmatism"? It was the Soviet revisionist group. In 1962, who slandered the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao, as a "dogmatist"? It was still the Soviet revisionist group. This number one capitalist-roader in the Party, while flattering "Long live Khrushchev," was gnashing his teeth and attacking Chairman Mao, attacking Mao Zedong Thought, which shows that he and Khrushchev are birds of a feather.

Chairman Mao has long taught us: "The revisionists, the right-opportunists, also hang the banner of Marxism on their mouths. They also attack 'dogmatism.' But what they attack is precisely the most fundamental thing in Marxism." The "dogmatism" attacked in "On Cultivation" is precisely Marxism-Leninism, precisely the essence of Mao Zedong Thought. The enemy's slander does not in the slightest diminish the brilliance of the red sun in our hearts. He can only lift a stone to drop on his own feet, further exposing his wolfish ambitions.

Providing Ammunition for Right-Opportunists, Defending Modern Revisionism

In 1962, the struggle between the two lines at home and abroad was extremely fierce.

Domestic class enemies were crying out for the right-opportunists who had been "dismissed" from their posts, calling for their rehabilitation and resurrection. "The Dismissal of Hai Rui" and "Night Talks in Yan Mountain" were released one after another. At this time, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, on the one hand, openly said that right-opportunist elements "can be rehabilitated as long as they are not colluding with foreign countries"; on the other hand, in his reprinted "On Cultivation," he ruthlessly cut out parts about the struggle between the two lines and added parts about preventing "excessive" struggles within the Party and preventing "leftist" tendencies, providing "theoretical" grounds for the rehabilitation of right-opportunists. He said: "This absolute attitude towards intra-party struggle was once utilized by the 'leftist' opportunists within the Party. They developed mechanical and excessive struggles within the Party into deliberately searching for 'struggle targets' within the Party, deliberately creating intra-party struggles, and even using organizational means and extra-party struggle means to punish comrades, attempting to promote work through such so-called struggles and organizational means." For example: "The 'leftist' opportunists' attitude towards intra-party struggle, their mistakes are very obvious. In their eyes, any intra-party peace, even if there is complete agreement on principles and lines within the Party, is unacceptable. They insist on 'searching' for struggle targets within the Party even when there are no principled differences within the Party, treating certain comrades as 'opportunists,' as 'straw men' in intra-party struggles. They believe that the development of the Party and the victory of the proletarian revolutionary struggle can only be achieved through such erroneous struggles, through the firepower of shooting 'straw men.'"

He concentrated the scattered black words from the original version and maliciously attacked the struggle against right-opportunism led by the Party Central Committee with Chairman Mao at its core in 1959 as being "excessive," more "leftist" than the "leftist" opportunist struggles in history, as "subjectively fabricated," as "stirring up trouble out of nothing," as treating certain "comrades" as "opportunists" to be shot at in intra-party struggles, and so on.

The author of "On Cultivation," the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, is really opposing "leftist opportunism"? No! He is using the pretext of opposing "leftist opportunism" to attack the struggle against right-opportunism, attempting to rehabilitate right-opportunist elements, thereby negating Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, negating Chairman Mao's correct leadership, in order to usurp the Party and seize power.

The struggle against right-opportunism in 1959 was a reflection of the class struggle within the Party. Right-opportunist elements opposed the Three Red Banners, opposed socialism, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and opposed Chairman Mao. This was a life-and-death struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, a fierce struggle to defend Chairman Mao, defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and defend socialism. We say that the struggle against right-opportunism is not at all "excessive," not at all "leftist." No matter who it is, whether now or in the future, as long as they dare to oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we will resolutely struggle against them, knock them down to the ground, and step on them with our feet, so that they can never rise again.

Chairman Mao has taught us: "If the enemy fiercely opposes us, slandering us as worthless, that would be even better, that would prove that we not only draw a clear line with the enemy but also prove that our work is very successful." This number one capitalist-roader in the Party is so fiercely attacking the struggle against right-opportunism, which precisely shows that the struggle against right-opportunism is good, very good! It hits the right-opportunist elements, hurting the heart of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, which precisely shows that the number one capitalist-roader in the Party is the patron of the right-opportunist elements, a Khrushchev-style schemer.

In summary, the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, in this black book, opposes Chairman Mao, opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, opposes Mao Zedong Thought, and is guilty of countless crimes. It must be thoroughly and completely criticized!

"On Cultivation" has been spreading poison for decades, causing great harm, especially since 1962, when it was published in a short few years, increasing from two million copies to twenty million copies, from four languages to twelve languages, and sold domestically and internationally, causing even greater harm.

"On Cultivation" is a program for building a revisionist party, a "theoretical" basis for the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, a textbook for cultivating revisionist seedlings, and a preparation of public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. It must be criticized deeply, thoroughly, and stinkingly!

Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, the greatest helmsman of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the whole world. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeblood. We understand that Mao Zedong Thought is the only correct guiding ideology for our country's revolution to achieve victory, and Chairman Mao's correct leadership is the fundamental guarantee for our country's revolution to achieve victory.

Towards Chairman Mao, we are infinitely loving, infinitely loyal, infinitely believing, and infinitely worshipping. We will use our blood and lives to defend Chairman Mao, use our blood and lives to defend Mao Zedong Thought, and use our blood and lives to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We will forever follow Chairman Mao, advancing in great winds and waves! Advance! Advance! Advance again! Even if our heads are cut off and our blood flows, our red hearts loving Chairman Mao will never be lost!

Let the plum blossoms rejoice in the snow, freezing the flies to death is nothing strange. Let us raise the thousand-catty stick of Mao Zedong Thought and definitely pull down the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, let him stand aside. Dig out the patron of revisionism in our country, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and let the light of Mao Zedong Thought shine upon the whole world!

Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live our most beloved leader Chairman Mao!

    戳穿《修养》再版的恶毒用心
    北京矿业学院东方红　北京工农兵体育学院毛泽东主义兵团
    毛主席说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”
    就在一九六二年，国内外阶级斗争极其尖锐的时候，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，把他的《修养》修修补补，又抛了出来，充斥国内外，把攻击的矛头直接指向了我们的伟大领袖毛主席。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派修改再版的《修养》中一开始就说：“我要讲的，是共产党员的修养问题。现在来讲讲这个问题，对于党的建设和巩固，不是没有益处的。”其中“现在”二字是原版中没有的。这意味深长的两个字泄露了天机，所以我们批判《修养》，不能离开一九六二年的历史条件，不能离开一九六二年的国内外阶级斗争。
    在《修养》中，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派贬低、攻击毛主席是极为猖狂、极为恶毒的，手法也是极其阴险、极其卑劣的。正象马克思所说的：“如果说他在理论上一窍不通，那么，他在干阴谋勾当方面却是颇为能干的。”
    让我们撕开《修养》的画皮，揭穿他的鬼花招，把他的狰狞面目暴露在光天化日之下。
    疯狂反对我们伟大领袖毛主席
    一九六○年，毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志向我们发出了“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”的伟大号召，全国人民积极响应，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。毛泽东思想日益深入人心。林彪同志的号召触疼了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，他恨之入骨，公开对抗。在再版的《修养》中，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派别有用心地说：要“作马克思和列宁的好学生”，我们知道，毛主席把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家。要作“马克思和列宁的好学生”，就必须做毛主席的好学生。在这里，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派绝不是要人们去做马克思和列宁的好学生，而是借此反对林彪同志提出的“做毛主席的好战士”的伟大号召。同时，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在赫鲁晓夫大反斯大林之时，删去了斯大林的名字。这是公开配合苏修反对斯大林，反对中国共产党对斯大林的正确评价。
    在这本长达四万八千多字的又臭又长的《修养》中，他提出的所谓党员修养共九个方面，就是不提活学活用毛主席著作这一最最关键的问题。更恶毒的是，他引用毛主席语录，有的是勉强加进去的，有的是打着“红旗”反红旗，明目张胆地反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派一面极力贬低毛主席，一面恬不知耻地吹捧自己是“毫无个人目的，完全忠实于党的党员，他有高度的共产主义道德，他有最大的勇敢”，说什么“他的工作不论在多少年之后去检查都没有不符合党的利益的事”，他俨然以马克思列宁主义的最高法官自居，扬言要“检验一切理论”，真是胆大包天，不知人间有“羞耻”二字。一九四九年他在天津东亚毛纺厂曾经狂妄地吹嘘：“我现在在中国不数一、也数二”。
    这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，就是这样玩弄一贬一抬的鬼花招，千方百计地来贬低毛主席，抬高他自己，妄图为他篡党、篡军、篡政，实现资本主义复辟制造舆论。
    疯狂诋毁毛泽东思想
    毛主席早在一九五七年《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》中就指出：“在现在的情况下，修正主义是比教条主义更有害的东西。我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”一九六二年，正是国内外修正主义思潮大肆泛滥的时候，再版的《修养》，不仅只字不提反对修正主义，反而和以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义集团遥相呼应，一唱一和，大反“‘左’倾机会主义”，大反“党内过火斗争”，大反“教条主义”，疯狂地攻击马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。在一九四九年版的《修养》中，他在攻击“教条主义者”时说：“这一种人在中国共产党内曾是不少的。其中最坏的代表，就比上述情形更坏。……然而我们是否能够完全自信的说，在我们党内就完全不会有这种人了呢？我们还不能这样说。”而在一九六二年再版中，他作了如下重要修改：“这一种人在中国共产党内曾经是不少的。在过去某一时期内，某些教条主义的代表人，就比上述的情形更坏……然而我们是否能够完全自信地说，在我们党内从此就不会再有这种人了呢？我们还不能这样说。”
    《修养》的作者、党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，把“其中最坏的代表，就比上述的情形更坏”改成“在过去某一时期内，某些教条主义的代表人，就比上述的情形更坏”，把“完全不会有这种人了呢？”改为“从此就不会再有这种人了呢？”
    这两处的修改是别有用心的，是有所指的。一九六二年，是谁攻击高举马克思列宁主义大旗的中国共产党是“教条主义”呢？是苏修集团。一九六二年，是谁污蔑当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席是“教条主义者”呢？还是苏修集团。这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派一方面肉麻地喊“赫鲁晓夫万岁”，一方面却咬牙切齿地攻击毛主席，攻击毛泽东思想，这就说明他和赫鲁晓夫是一丘之貉。
    毛主席早就教导我们：“修正主义者，右倾机会主义者，口头上也挂着马克思主义，他们也在那里攻击‘教条主义’。但是他们所攻击的正是马克思主义的最根本的东西。”《修养》攻击的所谓“教条主义”，正是马克思列宁主义，正是毛泽东思想的精髓。敌人的污蔑，丝毫无损于我们心中最红最红的红太阳的光辉。他只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚，进一步暴露他的狼子野心。
    为右倾机会主义者翻案，为现代修正主义鸣冤叫屈
    一九六二年，国际国内两条路线的斗争异常激烈。
    国内阶级敌人为被“罢”了官的右倾机会主义者鸣冤叫屈，招尸还魂。《海瑞罢官》《燕山夜话》纷纷出笼。此时，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派一面明目张胆地胡说什么右倾机会主义分子“只要不是里通外国的就可以翻案”；另一方面，又在他的《修养》再版中大砍大劈关于两条路线斗争的部分，大加特加关于防止党内“过火”斗争，防止“‘左’倾”的部分，为右倾机会主义者提供翻案的“理论”根据。他说：“这种对党内斗争的绝对态度，在一个时期内曾经被党内的‘左’倾机会主义者所利用。他们把党内的机械的过火的斗争，发展到故意在党内搜索‘斗争对象’，故意制造党内斗争，并且滥用组织手段甚至党外斗争的手段来惩罚同志，企图依靠这种所谓斗争和组织手段来推动工作。”又比如：“党内的‘左’倾机会主义者对待党内斗争的态度，他们的错误是很明显的。按照这些似乎疯癫的人看来，任何党内和平，即使是在原则路线上完全一致的党内和平，也是要不得的。他们在党内并没有原则分歧的时候也硬要去‘搜索’斗争对象，把某些同志当作‘机会主义者’，作为党内斗争中射击的‘草人’。他们认为，党的发展，无产阶级革命斗争的胜利，只有依靠这种错误的斗争，依靠这种射击‘草人’的火力，才能得到灵验如神的开展。”
    他把原版中七零八散的黑话集中起来，恶毒地攻击以毛主席为代表的党中央一九五九年领导的反右倾斗争“过火”了，是比历史上的“左”倾机会主义的斗争还“左”，是“主观臆造”，是“平地起风波”，是把某些“同志”当作“机会主义”来作为党内斗争射击的“草人”等等。
    《修养》的作者、党内头号走资本主义道路当权派是真的在反对“‘左’倾机会主义”吗？不！他是打着反对“‘左’倾机会主义”的幌子，来攻击反右倾机会主义的斗争，妄想为右倾机会主义分子翻案，从而否定毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，否定毛主席的正确领导，以便他篡党夺权，取而代之。
    一九五九年反右倾机会主义斗争是阶级斗争在党内的反映。右倾机会主义分子反对三面红旗，反对社会主义，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席，这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的殊死斗争，是一场保卫毛主席、保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、保卫社会主义的你死我活的大搏斗。我们说，反对右倾机会主义的斗争一点也不“过火”，一点也不“左”。不管是谁，不管是现在还是将来，只要他胆敢反对毛主席，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们就要同他进行坚决的斗争，就要把他打翻在地，踏上一只脚，让他永世不得翻身。
    毛主席教导我们：“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派这样拚命地攻击反右倾机会主义的斗争，这正好说明反右倾机会主义的斗争反得好，好得很！打在右倾机会主义分子的身上，疼在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的心上，这正好说明了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派是右倾机会主义分子的总后台，是赫鲁晓夫式的野心家。
    总之，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在这本黑书中反对毛主席，反对无产阶级专政，反对毛泽东思想，罪恶累累，必须进行全面的、彻底的批判！
    《修养》几十年来流毒极广，危害极深，特别是一九六二年以来短短的几年中出版数由二百万册增至二千万册，文字由四种增为十二种，销售国内外，危害就更大。
    《修养》是一个修正主义建党的纲领，是资产阶级反动路线的“理论”根据，是培养修正主义苗子的教科书，是资本主义复辟的舆论准备，必须把它批深、批透、批臭！
    毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，是中国人民和全世界革命人民最伟大的舵手，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。我们懂得，毛泽东思想是指导我国革命取得胜利的唯一正确的指导思想，毛主席的正确领导是我国革命取得胜利的根本保证。
    对毛主席，我们就是无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，无限崇拜。我们要用鲜血和生命来保卫毛主席，用鲜血和生命来保卫毛泽东思想，用鲜血和生命来保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。我们要永远跟着毛主席，在大风大浪中前进！前进！再前进！头可断，血可流，我们热爱毛主席的红心永不丢！
    梅花欢喜漫天雪，冻死苍蝇未足奇。让我们奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，一定要把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派拉下马，让他靠边站。挖出我国修正主义的总后台，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，让毛泽东思想的光芒普照全世界！
    伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
                  （原载四月六日《北京日报》）
