The U.S. Empire is intensifying its neo-colonialist policies in the Congo (Leopoldville), directing Mobutu to disguise himself while ruthlessly suppressing patriotic armed forces.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on April 6, our correspondent reports: Since the Mobutu puppet regime took power more than a year ago, it has been intensifying American neo-colonialist policies in the Congo (Leopoldville), selling out national interests, and implementing fascist rule within the country. This reactionary regime is a tool for American oppression and enslavement of the Congolese people.

Mobutu was originally a lackey of Belgian old colonialism, later bought by the infamous U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, with the blood of Congolese patriots on his hands. Since being installed in power in November 1965, Mobutu—this Congolese traitor—has, at the behest of his American masters, played a series of deceptive tricks. Politically, Mobutu hypocritically declared Lumumba a "national hero" and erected a "memorial" for him, attempting to portray himself as the successor of Lumumbaism to cover up his role in the murder of Lumumba, making it easier to further suppress Congolese patriotic forces. In foreign relations, Mobutu falsely claimed to want to "be friendly with Africa" and "normalize diplomatic relations with African brother countries," attempting to use this to escape his isolated position in Africa and at the same time prevent African countries from aiding the Congolese patriotic armed struggle. Economically, Mobutu loudly proclaimed the need to "restore Congo's international and economic sovereignty" and "strive for economic independence," putting on a show of "opposing" colonialist forces. However, in reality, he actively served American neo-colonialism in replacing Belgian old colonialism in the Congo. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "In Africa, American imperialism is intensifying its neo-colonialist policies, attempting to replace the old colonialists, plunder and enslave the peoples of various African countries, and sabotage and suppress national liberation movements."

This puppet, under the direction and support of American imperialism, has received a large amount of weapons and military "experts" from the Americans and is ruthlessly suppressing the Congolese patriotic armed forces. According to reports, following a previous batch of American poison gas "experts," on May 5 last year, U.S. Air Force "expert" Adam arrived in the Congo (Leopoldville) to specially train Congolese pseudo-military officers in the "art" of "sweeping" out patriotic armed forces; from July to August last year, the U.S. handed over a batch of C-47 type aircraft, thirty-seven military trucks, and a batch of military supplies to Mobutu's pseudo-army. Various weapons from the U.S. have been continuously transported to the Congo (Leopoldville). It has been proven that the weapons and technical personnel of the pseudo-army and mercenaries currently suppressing the patriotic armed forces are almost entirely provided by the U.S. According to an article in the Belgian Communist Party organ, *The Voice of the People*, on January 13 this year, the U.S. government has agreed to provide Mobutu's pseudo-police department with 324 million West African francs and will send six American police "experts" to the Congo (Leopoldville). Mobutu's police are fully equipped with American gear, and large numbers of officers have been sent to the U.S. for training.

Chairman Mao pointed out: The nature of imperialism is plunder, and the policies of imperialist countries in "peaceful" times are always for plunder. The past actions of the U.S. in the Congo (Leopoldville) fully prove this proposition. American imperialism cunningly uses "aid" to backward countries as a pretext, through providing "economic aid" to the Mobutu puppet regime and other means, to greatly infiltrate and plunder the Congo (Leopoldville) economically. According to reports, soon after Mobutu took power, the U.S. gave the Mobutu regime $1 million in "aid." Since then, the U.S. has signed a series of so-called "aid" agreements with the Mobutu puppet regime. Among these, in 1966 alone, the U.S. provided the Mobutu regime with over $50 million in "aid," most of which was used to purchase American corn, flour, rice, coffee, and cotton, turning the Congo (Leopoldville), which once exported rice, coffee, and cotton, into an important market for the U.S. to dump "surplus" agricultural products, thereby greatly damaging the agricultural production of this African country. American monopolies have similarly plundered the rich mineral resources of the Congo (Leopoldville). According to reports, in December 1965, the so-called "aid and barter agreement" signed by the U.S. with the Mobutu regime provided 5,000 tons of grain to Mobutu, while taking away $20 million worth of diamonds from the Congo (Leopoldville), "turning Congo's industrial diamonds into U.S. defense reserves."

The Mobutu puppet regime, to further sell out national interests, publicly requested through its "ambassador" in Washington that the U.S. financial sector invest in the Congo (Leopoldville); Mobutu's "minister of finance," Lito, personally went to the U.S. to request that American capital establish a television station in the Congo (Leopoldville). The policy of "striving for economic independence" that Mobutu is pushing to serve the U.S. empire has greatly pleased his American masters. The U.S. commercial attaché to the "embassy" in Leopoldville, Martin Jacob, in a report on the Congolese economy, openly stated that the economic prospects (for the U.S.) are "full of hope," and "American businessmen face opportunities."

In fact, under the rule of the Mobutu puppet regime, the Congo (Leopoldville) has already become a U.S. colony. An American magazine last year admitted in an article: "After six years of independence, this country is actually still a dependent colony. The difference is that it was previously ruled by Belgians, now it is Americans together with Belgians, mainly Americans, who are in control."

The result of the Mobutu puppet regime's execution of a sellout policy is: national debt has reached 20 billion Congolese francs, production has been severely damaged, people's living necessities are in short supply, prices are soaring, and public resentment is boiling. Now, the people in the enemy-occupied areas of the Congo (Leopoldville) are increasingly joining the struggle against imperialist oppression and exploitation. Workers and masses in various parts of the Congo (Leopoldville) frequently go on strike and demonstrate. The traitor Mobutu adopts savage suppression against the people. He has issued nationwide orders banning strikes, simultaneously ordering the dissolution of all youth organizations and prohibiting their activities. In the same year, he also announced the prohibition of all activities of the Congolese Workers' General Union. Anyone who shows the slightest dissatisfaction with Mobutu's sellout and dictatorial rule is immediately arrested. According to reports, Mobutu's pseudo-police recently arrested 3,180 people in the Bandalungwa district of Leopoldville. Currently, the prisons in the Congo (Leopoldville) are filled with "political prisoners."

However, where there is oppression, there is resistance. The brave Congolese people are not intimidated or crushed. The patriotic armed forces in the western part of the Congo (Leopoldville) have recently issued a call to broadly mobilize the masses, strengthen the armed struggle against the U.S. empire and its lackeys, and fight until the liberation of the motherland is achieved. No matter whether the U.S. empire and its lackeys adopt conciliatory and deceptive methods or engage in naked, savage suppression, they cannot save themselves from the inevitable doom. The just struggle of the Congolese people will surely achieve final victory.

    美帝在刚果（利）加紧推行新殖民主义
    指使蒙博托一面乔装打扮一面加紧镇压爱国武装力量
    据新华社六日讯　本社记者报道：刚果（利）蒙博托傀儡政权上台一年多来，在刚果（利）加紧推行美国新殖民主义政策，出卖民族利益，在国内实行法西斯统治。这个反动政权是美国压迫和奴役刚果人民的工具。
    蒙博托原是比利时老牌殖民主义豢养的走狗，后来为臭名远扬的美国中央情报局收买，双手沾满了刚果（利）爱国者的鲜血。自从一九六五年十一月被扶植上台以后，蒙博托——这个刚果（利）叛徒为了更好地为其美国主子效劳，在主子的授意下，接连玩弄了一系列的欺骗性花招。在政治上，蒙博托假惺惺地宣布卢蒙巴为“民族英雄”，并为他建立“纪念碑”，妄图把自己打扮成卢蒙巴主义的“继承者”，以掩盖参与杀害卢蒙巴的凶手的真面目，便于进一步镇压刚果爱国力量。在对外关系上，蒙博托虚伪地表示“要同非洲友好”、“与非洲兄弟国家外交关系正常化”，妄想以此来摆脱自己在非洲的孤立处境，同时阻止非洲国家援助刚果（利）爱国武装斗争。在经济方面，蒙博托大叫大嚷要“恢复刚果国际的和经济方面的主权”、“争取经济独立”，摆出一副“反对”殖民主义势力的样子，但是，实际上却积极在为美国新殖民主义在刚果取代比利时老殖民主义效劳。正如毛主席所英明指出的：“在非洲，美帝国主义加紧推行新殖民主义政策，力图取代老殖民主义者的地位，掠夺和奴役非洲各国人民，破坏和扑灭民族解放运动。”
    蒙博托这个傀儡从美帝国主义那里接受了大量武器和军事“专家”，并在美国主子的大力支持和指使下，加紧镇压刚果（利）爱国武装力量。据报道，继以前一批美国毒气“专家”之后，去年五月五日，美国空军“专家”亚当到达刚果（利），专门训练刚果（利）伪军军官掌握“扫荡”爱国武装的“艺术”；去年七月到八月间，美国把一批C—47型飞机、三十七辆军用卡车和一批军用物资交给蒙博托伪军。美国的各种武器也源源不断地运到刚果（利）。有消息证明，目前镇压爱国武装的蒙博托伪军和雇佣军的武器和技术人员几乎完全由美国提供。据比利时共产党机关报《人民之声报》今年一月十三日一篇文章揭露，美国政府已答应给蒙博托伪警察局三亿两千四百万西非法郎，并将派遣六名美国警察“专家”去刚果（利）。蒙博托的警察全是美式装备，大批警官被送往美国受训。
    毛主席指出：帝国主义的本性是掠夺，帝国主义国家在“和平”时代的政策也无时不是为了掠夺。美帝过去在刚果（利）的所作所为充分证明了这一论断。美帝国主义还狡猾地以“援助”落后国家为名，通过向蒙博托傀儡政权提供“经济援助”等，大肆对刚果（利）进行经济渗透和掠夺。据报道，蒙博托上台后没几天，美国就赏给蒙博托政权一百万美元的“援助”。从那时以来，美国同蒙博托傀儡政权签订了一系列所谓“援助”协定。其中仅一九六六年，美国给蒙博托政权的“援助”就达到五千多万美元，其中大部分规定用来购买美国的玉米、面粉、大米、咖啡和棉花等，使这个过去出口大米、咖啡和棉花的刚果（利）成为美国倾销“剩余”农产品的重要市场，从而大大破坏了这个非洲国家的农业生产。美国垄断资本还用同样方法掠夺刚果（利）的丰富矿产。据报道，一九六五年十二月美国同蒙博托政权签订的所谓“援助和换货协定”，美国向蒙博托提供五千吨粮食，而从刚果（利）运走价值二千万美元的钻石，“使刚果的工业用钻石变成美国国防储存”。
    蒙博托傀儡政权为了进一步出卖民族利益，公然通过它驻华盛顿的“大使”要求美国金融界到刚果（利）投资；蒙博托的“财政部长”利托还亲自去美国要求美国资本在刚果（利）建立电视台。蒙博托推行的为美帝效劳的所谓“争取经济独立”的政策，颇得美国主子的欢心。美国驻利奥波德维尔“大使馆”商务参赞马丁·雅各在一个关于刚果（利）经济的报告中曾毫不掩饰地说，刚果经济的前景（对美国）是“充满希望的”，“美国实业家面临着机会”。
    事实上，在蒙博托傀儡政权统治下的刚果（利）早已成为美国的殖民地。美国一家杂志去年在一篇文章中也供认：“刚果在取得独立之后六年，这个国家实际上仍然是一个附属的殖民地。大不相同的是，过去是比利时人统治，现在是美国人同比利时人在一起，而主要是美国人进行控制。”
    蒙博托傀儡政权执行卖国政策的结果是：国家债务高达二百亿刚果法郎，生产遭到严重破坏，人民生活必需品奇缺，物价飞涨，民怨沸腾。现在，处于水深火热之中的刚果（利）敌占区人民越来越多地投入了反对帝国主义的压迫和剥削的斗争。刚果（利）各地群众经常举行罢工和示威。卖国贼蒙博托对人民则采取了野蛮镇压。他接连颁发全国禁止罢工的法令，同时下令解散一切青年组织，禁止他们活动。同年十二月，又宣布禁止刚果工人总联合会的一切活动。凡是流露出对蒙博托卖国独裁统治稍有不满的人，立即遭到逮捕。据报道，蒙博托的伪警察最近在利奥波德维尔的班达隆瓜区，一次逮捕了三千一百八十余人。目前，刚果（利）的监狱里充满了“政治犯”。
    但是，那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。英勇的刚果（利）人民是吓不倒和打不垮的。刚果（利）西线爱国武装力量最近已发出号召，广泛动员人民群众，加强反对美帝及其走狗的武装斗争，直到实现祖国的解放。美帝国主义和它的走狗不管采取和缓欺骗的手法还是进行赤裸裸的野蛮镇压，都不能挽救终将走向灭亡的命运。刚果（利）人民的正义斗争必将取得最后胜利。
