Correctly handling revolutionary cadres and firmly implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy are crucial for the success of the "three-in-one combination." In our bureau, the revolutionary masses, after seizing power and on the basis of great unity, adopted a policy of differentiating among the leading cadres. They encouraged and supported those who had made mistakes to join the revolution and gradually implemented the "three-in-one combination" with revolutionary cadres, enabling them to play a role in the core leadership of seizing and holding power.

Eliminating the Harmful Influence of "Striking Down a Large Number and Protecting a Few"

In our bureau, except for a very few who are capitalist-roaders within the Party, most of the leading cadres are good. Of course, some of them have made mistakes to varying degrees. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered the stage of great unity among the revolutionary masses and the seizure of power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, how to handle these leading cadres to implement the policy of the "three-in-one combination" became a very important issue for the revolutionary masses. At that time, some comrades, influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few," did not use the method of class analysis to view cadres but instead suspected and denied everything, advocating that all those in power should step aside and be kicked out.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "One must be good at identifying cadres. One should not only look at a cadre's momentary actions but also at the cadre's entire history and work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." Regarding cadres who have made mistakes in their line, Chairman Mao instructs us: "One should not emphasize the responsibility of individual comrades but rather analyze the environment at that time, the content of the mistake at that time, the social roots, historical roots, and ideological roots of the mistake at that time, and implement the policy of punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient, thereby achieving the two goals of clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades."

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we analyzed the leading cadres at various levels and concluded that most of them are good or relatively good and are revolutionary. Regarding cadres who have made mistakes, we should use a class and historical perspective for specific analysis. We should distinguish between cadres who have made general mistakes and those who have made mistakes in their line. Even for those who have made mistakes in their line, we should conduct specific analyses. Many of them unconsciously executed the bourgeois reactionary line and were both executors and victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. Some have already made sincere self-criticisms. We cannot only see their performance during the Cultural Revolution but ignore their consistent performance in history; we cannot only see the mistakes they made during the movement but ignore their repentant performance. We must not, because they made mistakes, fail to conduct specific analyses or even confuse the two types of contradictions. Based on this understanding, we analyzed the leading cadres at various levels in our bureau. Generally, there are four types:

1. Those who have fought against the capitalist-roaders within the Party in the past and have been persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line in this movement. They have made general mistakes, have already criticized and examined themselves, and have now stood up to fight together with the revolutionary masses.
2. Those who generally executed the bourgeois reactionary line or made other mistakes, have already recognized and examined themselves, but are afraid to boldly expose and fear that the masses will not believe them.
3. Those who promoted the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the movement and have resistance to the masses' criticism of their mistakes.
4. Those who are the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and must be resolutely overthrown.

Through such an analysis, we distinguished between the two types of contradictions, clarifying that except for the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, for the majority of cadres who have made mistakes to varying degrees, we should, according to the policy of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient," give them the opportunity to correct their mistakes and welcome them to break with the capitalist-roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line, returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. If we do not distinguish between right and wrong, deny everything, and overthrow everything, the result will only be to drive them to the enemy's side, harm comrades, isolate ourselves, benefit the enemy, and be detrimental to the revolution.

The Process of Uniting Cadres is a Struggle Between Two Lines

During the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, some cadres who had made mistakes, under the appeal of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and with the help of the revolutionary masses, stood up to expose the secrets of the bureau party committee's execution of the bourgeois reactionary line and expressed their willingness to return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. This is something we should welcome. However, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party hate this revolutionary action of the leading cadres to the core. They know that if these leading cadres stand up to expose their secrets, their ugly faces will be fully exposed. Therefore, they became furious, gathered a few royalists, deceived some uninformed masses, and several times attacked the revolutionary leading cadres, accusing them of "disruptionism" and "opportunism." They even used organizational means of the Party to exert pressure, attempting to disrupt our class line. At that time, some comrades in our revolutionary faction, influenced by anarchist tendencies, also had doubts about the leading cadres who stood up for the revolution. While the leading cadres who wanted to stand up for the revolution were also hesitant, fearing that they would be accused of "sharpening their heads to squeeze in," and so on.

We believe that whether or not we can win over more leading cadres to join the revolution depends, on the one hand, on the actual performance of the leading cadres, and on the other hand, on the attitude of the proletarian revolutionary faction towards them. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any person who makes a mistake, as long as he does not hide his illness and fear treatment, does not stubbornly persist in his mistake to the point of being beyond redemption, but is sincere and truly willing to be treated and corrected, we should welcome him, cure his illness, and turn him into a good comrade." We, as the proletarian revolutionary faction, are the loyal defenders of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We must unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, actively unite with them, and actively win them over, encouraging them to join the revolution.

Winning over cadres who have made mistakes is a delicate and complex task. Their mistakes must be critically examined seriously, and no concessions should be made. However, our attitude towards them must be active and enthusiastic, helping them patiently. We organized them to study documents, helped them raise their awareness, and urged them to expose problems. For those who were truly willing to return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and had actual performance, we let them join the fight with us. A deputy director, for example, was the first to stand up and expose and criticize the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line, and his performance was good. We handled it this way. This incident had a significant impact on other leading cadres, and they stood up to expose and criticize. We gave them the opportunity to "come out." We also held small-scale symposiums, openly explained the policy to them according to their different ideological conditions, pointed out the way out. In addition, we organized them to go through the storms of class struggle in society and see the world of mass struggle. Let them see the big-character posters of leading cadres "coming out" in other units, participate in relevant meetings and parades, and listen to relevant reports. This way, cadres who have made mistakes can understand the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, know the central policy, and have a clear mind.

Firmly Hold Principles, Differentiate Treatment, and Arrange Properly

Chairman Mao said: "The Communist Party of China is a party leading a great revolutionary struggle in a nation of tens of millions of people. Without a large number of cadres who are both morally and professionally qualified, it cannot accomplish its historical mission." We deeply understand that to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and to achieve a thorough victory in the struggle for power, a large number of revolutionary leading cadres are indispensable. However, should all leading cadres who stand up be included in the temporary power-organizing body of the "three-in-one combination"? The understanding within our revolutionary faction is not consistent. Some comrades advocate not setting conditions and including all leading cadres who stand up. Some comrades believe that only those leading cadres who have been consistently correct can be included. Some even believe that the world is seized by our revolutionary faction, and combining with leading cadres is equivalent to negating our revolutionary rebellion and giving up the power we have seized.

Facing this situation, our revolutionary faction repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's cadre policy and relevant editorials in the *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily*. Chairman Mao said: "Our party, if it does not have a large number of new cadres cooperating with old cadres, will not be able to complete its mission." Based on this teaching, regarding cadres who have made mistakes, as long as they are willing to thoroughly correct their mistakes, draw a clear line with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and completely break with the bourgeois reactionary line, returning to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we should believe in them and dare to combine with them. If the requirements are too high and detached from reality, it is essentially a lack of belief in revolutionary leading cadres and a poor understanding of Chairman Mao's cadre policy. On the contrary, if no conditions are set, and all leading cadres who stand up are combined, forcing a compromise, this is also not in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought and cannot truly establish a "revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian temporary power-organizing body." Through repeated study, everyone unified their thoughts, corrected their understanding, and according to Chairman Mao's instructions, distinguished among the leading cadres who stood up, and based on the severity of their mistakes and their performance in the movement, as well as the needs of the work, made different arrangements. Some were absorbed into the bureau revolutionary committee to participate in the core leadership; some participated in the revolutionary small groups of the departments; some were arranged to do leadership work within a certain scope; and some were checked and worked at the same time. This way, leading cadres can fully play their due roles, and it is also ensured that the "three-in-one combination" temporary power-organizing body is revolutionary, representative, and has proletarian authority.

Fully Mobilizing the Enthusiasm of Revolutionary Leading Cadres

Regarding the attitude towards leading cadres who have already joined the "three-in-one combination," should we trust and support them, or be half-believing and half-doubting, placing them in an insignificant position? This is an important issue in whether we can truly implement the policy of the "three-in-one combination." When we first seized power, we had insufficient understanding of the role of revolutionary leading cadres in the "three-in-one combination." Some said: "Let them participate in the 'three-in-one combination' is fine, but they should not be the core leaders." Some were afraid that if they became core leaders, they would make the revolutionary masses wear small shoes. Therefore, for a period of time, we lacked sufficient trust and support for the leading cadres who had already combined, dared not use them boldly, and dared not let them be core leaders. In this situation, the leading cadres who participated in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" were not mentally stable, had a sense of being a guest, dared not work boldly, and lacked a sense of ownership. Formally combined, but not mentally combined.

Chairman Mao said: "Only the enthusiasm of the leading cadres, without the enthusiasm of the broad masses, will become the busywork of a few. But if there is only the enthusiasm of the broad masses, without a powerful leading cadre to properly organize the enthusiasm of the masses, then the enthusiasm of the masses will neither be sustained nor move in the correct direction and reach a higher level." The facts have proven that in the temporary power-organizing body of the "three-in-one combination," revolutionary leading cadres have played a very good role. For example, the former deputy secretary and deputy director of the bureau, Comrade Sun Huasheng, after standing up, did political and ideological work for the leading cadres who were still hesitant and had not yet stood up, with good results. Some leading cadres, after combining with the revolutionary masses, fully played their organizational and professional abilities, shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, and played a very good role in helping the proletarian revolutionary faction to hold power and establish a revolutionary work order.

Due to the trust, support, and help of the broad revolutionary masses, the revolutionary leading cadres further clarified their position and the glorious mission in the "three-in-one combination." They consulted with the masses on every matter, paid great attention to the opinions of revolutionary mass representatives, and made the bureau's Cultural Revolution movement and work present a prosperous scene, demonstrating the great power of the "three-in-one combination."

    正确地对待革命领导干部　实现革命的“三结合”
    山东省财政厅革命委员会
    正确地对待革命领导干部，坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，是搞好革命的“三结合”的关键。我们机关的无产阶级革命派在夺权过程中，在大联合的基础上，对领导干部采取了区别对待的政策，鼓励和支持犯错误的领导干部起来革命，并逐步地和革命的领导干部实现革命的“三结合”，使他们在夺权、掌权的核心领导中起作用。
    清除“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的恶劣影响
    我们机关的领导干部中，除极少数是党内走资本主义道路的当权派外，大部分干部是好的，当然他们中间有些人犯过不同程度的错误。当无产阶级文化大革命进入无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的新阶段的时候，怎样对待这些领导干部，以便执行革命的“三结合”的方针，这是摆在革命派面前十分重要的问题。当时，有些同志受资产阶级反动路线“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的影响，不是运用阶级分析的方法看待干部，而是怀疑一切，否定一切，主张凡是当权派都得靠边站，都要一脚踢开。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”对于犯路线错误的干部，毛主席又指示我们：“不应着重于一些个别同志的责任方面，而应着重于当时环境的分析，当时错误的内容，当时错误的社会根源、历史根源和思想根源，实行惩前毖后、治病救人的方针，借以达到既要弄清思想又要团结同志这样两个目的。”
    我们遵照毛主席的教导，对于各级领导干部进行了分析，认为大部分是好的和比较好的，是要革命的。对于犯错误的领导干部，应当用阶级的历史的观点进行具体分析。应该把犯有一般错误的干部与犯路线错误的干部区别开来。即使犯了路线错误的干部，也应该作具体分析，其中有很多人是不自觉地执行了资产阶级反动路线，他们既是资产阶级反动路线的执行者，也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，有的已作了认真的检查。我们不能只看到他们在文化大革命中的表现，看不到他们历史上的一贯表现；不能只看到他们在运动中所犯的错误，看不到他们的悔改表现。决不能因为他们犯了错误，就不加具体分析，甚至混淆了两类不同性质的矛盾。在这个认识的基础上，我们对本机关各级领导干部进行了分析。大致有四种情况：第一种：过去曾与党内走资本主义道路的当权派作过斗争，在这次运动中，又受到资产阶级反动路线的迫害，他们犯有一般错误，已经作了批判检查，现在已经站出来，与革命群众共同战斗；第二种：一般地执行了资产阶级反动路线，或犯有其他错误，已经有了认识和检查，但是他们“怕”字当头，既不敢大胆起来揭发，又怕群众不相信自己；第三种：在前段运动中推行了资产阶级反动路线，而对群众批判他们的错误有抵触情绪；第四种是必须坚决打倒的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    经过这样的分析，分清了两类不同性质的矛盾，明确了除去党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以外，对于大量的犯有不同程度错误的领导干部，都应该根据“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，给他们改正错误的机会，欢迎他们同党内走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线决裂，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。如果不分青红皂白，否定一切，打倒一切，其结果只会把他们赶到敌人一边去，损害了同志，孤立了自己，有利于敌人，不利于革命。
    团结干部的过程是两条路线斗争的过程
    在批判资产阶级反动路线的过程中，一部分犯错误的领导干部，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的感召下，在革命群众的帮助下，起来揭发厅党组执行资产阶级反动路线的内幕，表示愿意回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，这是应该欢迎的。但是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派对革命领导干部这种革命行动恨之入骨。他们懂得，这些领导干部起来揭发他们的内幕，他们的丑恶面目就会暴露无遗。于是，他们恼羞成怒，拼凑了几个保皇兵，蒙骗一些不明真相的群众，几次对革命领导干部进行围攻，攻击他们是“分散主义”、“机会主义”，甚至用党的组织手段施加压力，企图搅乱我们的阶级阵线。当时我们革命派中有的同志由于受无政府主义思潮的影响，对起来革命的领导干部也抱怀疑态度。而想起来革命的领导干部也有些畏首畏尾，怕人家说“削尖脑袋往里钻”，等等。
    我们认为能不能争取更多的领导干部起来革命，一方面固然取决于领导干部的实际表现，一方面也要看无产阶级革命派对他们采取什么态度。毛主席教导我们：“任何犯错误的人，只要他不讳疾忌医，不固执错误，以至于达到不可救药的地步，而是老老实实，真正愿意医治，愿意改正，我们就要欢迎他，把他的毛病治好，使他变为一个好同志。”我们革命派是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的忠实捍卫者，我们必须不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，主动地去团结他们，积极地去争取他们，鼓励他们起来革命。
    争取犯错误的领导干部是一项细致复杂的工作。对他们的错误必须进行严肃批判，决不迁就，但是对他们的态度，必须积极热情，耐心帮助。我们组织他们学习文件，帮助他们提高认识，督促他们交代揭发问题。对于真正愿意回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，并有实际表现的干部，就让他同我们一起参加战斗。有一位副处长，首先站出来揭发批判资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，表现不错，我们就这样办了。这件事对其他领导干部震动很大，他们站出来进行揭发和批判。我们就给他们“亮相”的机会。我们还召开小型座谈会，针对他们不同的思想状况，向他们公开交底，阐明政策，指明出路。此外，还组织他们到社会上去经阶级斗争的风雨，见群众斗争的世面。让他们去看其他单位领导干部“亮相”的大字报，参加有关的集会、游行，听取有关的报告。这样做，可以使犯错误的领导干部了解无产阶级文化大革命的形势，知道中央的政策，使他们心中有数。
    坚持原则，区别对待，妥善安排
    毛主席说：“中国共产党是在一个几万万人的大民族中领导伟大革命斗争的党，没有多数才德兼备的领导干部，是不能完成其历史任务的。”我们深深懂得，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，要取得夺权斗争的彻底胜利，没有众多的革命领导干部，是不可能的。但是，站出来的领导干部是否都参加革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构？在我们革命派内部认识是不一致的。有的同志主张不讲条件，凡是站出来的领导干部都要结合。有的同志认为，只有那些一贯正确的领导干部才能结合。有的甚至认为天下是我们革命派打下来的，和领导干部结合，就等于否定了我们革命造反之功，放弃了已经夺得的权力。
    面对这种情况，我们革命派反复学习了毛主席的干部政策和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的有关社论。毛主席说：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。”根据这一教导，对于犯错误的领导干部，只要他们愿意彻底改正错误，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派划清界限，同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，坚决回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，我们就应当相信他们，敢于和他们结合。如果要求过高，脱离实际，实质上是不相信革命的领导干部，是对毛主席的干部政策很不理解。相反的，如果不讲条件，对站出来的领导干部，站出来多少，就结合多少，勉强凑合，调和折中，这也是不符合毛泽东思想，而且是不能真正建立一个“革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构”的。经过反复学习，大家统一了思想，端正了认识，按照毛主席的指示，对站出来的领导干部加以鉴别，根据其错误的轻重程度和在运动中的表现，以及工作的需要，分别作了安排。有的吸收到厅革命委员会参加核心领导；有一部分干部参加了处室的革命小组；有的安排做一定范围的领导工作；也有的边检查、边工作。这样做，既使领导干部能够充分发挥他们应有的作用，又切实保证了“三结合”临时权力机构有革命性、有代表性、有无产阶级权威。
    充分发挥革命领导干部的积极性
    对于已经参加革命的“三结合”的领导干部采取什么态度：是信赖他们，支持他们呢，还是半信半疑，把他们放在无足轻重的地位？这是能否真正贯彻革命的“三结合”方针的一个重要问题。我们在开始夺权的时候，对革命领导干部在革命的“三结合”中的作用是认识不足的。有的说：“让他们参加‘三结合’还可以，但不能让他们当核心领导”。有的怕他们当了核心领导再给革命群众小鞋穿。因此，在一段时间内，对已经结合的领导干部缺乏充分的信任和支持，不敢大胆使用，不敢让他们当核心领导。在这种情况下，参加革命的“三结合”的领导干部思想上不踏实，有作客思想，不敢大胆工作，缺乏主人翁的态度。形式上结合了，思想上没有完全结合起来。
    毛主席说：“只有领导骨干的积极性，而无广大群众的积极性相结合，便将成为少数人的空忙。但如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”事实证明，在革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构中，革命的领导干部起了很好的作用。如原厅党组副书记、副厅长孙华生同志，他站出来后，对还犹豫不定、还没有站出来的领导干部做政治思想工作，效果很好。有的领导干部，和革命群众结合以后，充分发挥了他们的组织和业务能力，挑起革命和生产两副担子，对于无产阶级革命派掌好权，建立革命的工作秩序，起了很好的作用。
    由于广大革命群众对革命领导干部的信任、支持和帮助，革命领导干部也进一步明确了自己在革命的“三结合”中的地位和肩负的光荣任务。他们遇事和群众商量，十分重视革命群众代表的意见，使机关的文化大革命运动、工作都出现了一片欣欣向荣的气象，显示了革命的“三结合”的巨大威力。
