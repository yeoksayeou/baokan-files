Aden, April 8 (New China News Agency) — The "United Nations delegation" sent by UN Secretary-General U Thant to Aden to interfere in the anti-imperialist struggle of the South Yemeni people was forced to leave Aden on April 7 in the face of strong opposition and resistance from the South Yemeni people, who thwarted their sinister plots.

The dispatch of the "United Nations delegation" to Aden was a new colonialist conspiracy concocted by British imperialism to maintain its colonial interests in southern Arabia in collusion with US imperialism. As early as last year, British imperialism announced that it would grant "independence" to South Yemen in 1968. British imperialism intended to use the "United Nations delegation" to "assist in organizing elections" and arrange for the "independence" of its puppet "Federation of South Arabia." However, this "United Nations delegation" met with strong resistance from the South Yemeni people.

On the very evening of the delegation's arrival in Aden, the people of Aden began a massive general strike and demonstration. The protests continued for many days. During this period, South Yemeni nationalists intensified their attacks on British colonial forces with grenades, rifles, and automatic weapons. It was reported that on April 3 and 6 alone, nationalists in Aden attacked British colonial forces more than 120 times. On April 6, the British colonial authorities sent 12 tanks to the Shekh Othman area on the outskirts of Aden to suppress the protests. The nationalists launched a fierce counterattack. On the same day, in the Krat region, demonstrators also fired at British helicopters hovering in the sky. Since April 2, at least 16 British colonial soldiers have been injured.

Under the blows of the South Yemeni people, the "United Nations delegation" was in a state of disarray and could only stay in a heavily guarded hotel by the sea, unable to carry out any activities. On April 5, when the "United Nations delegation" first left the hotel to visit a prison on the outskirts of Aden, the political prisoners there demonstrated against them. Outside the prison, nationalists attacked the British colonial forces that came to suppress the protests. The "United Nations delegation" was in a state of panic and eventually had to be airlifted back to the hotel by helicopter. It was announced that the "United Nations delegation" had originally planned to stay in Aden for several weeks, but due to the resistance of the South Yemeni people, they had to leave Aden in a hurry.

After the "United Nations delegation" left Aden, the British Foreign Office immediately announced the dispatch of a cabinet minister to Aden to work with the British High Commissioner in Aden to push forward their sinister plans.

On April 7, Makawi, the General Secretary of the National Liberation Front of Occupied South Yemen, denounced in Cairo the British use of the "United Nations delegation" as a tool for their evil plans in the region. Makawi pointed out that the decision of the "United Nations delegation" to leave Aden was a victory won by the armed struggle of the people of occupied South Yemen.

Makawi also said on April 5 that any conspiracy played by Britain and its puppets in the region is doomed to failure. He said: The South Yemeni people will not hesitate to smash any attempt that aims to harm the just cause of the South Yemeni people.

    坚决反对美英新殖民主义的阴谋
    南也门人民赶走“联合国代表团”
    新华社八日讯　亚丁消息：由联合国秘书长吴丹派往亚丁干涉南也门人民反帝斗争的“联合国代表团”，在南也门人民的强烈抵制和反对下，无法施展阴谋活动，在七日灰溜溜地离开了亚丁。
    派“联合国代表团”去亚丁是英帝国主义为了保持它在阿拉伯半岛南部的殖民利益，同美帝国主义合伙玩弄的一个新殖民主义阴谋。早在去年，英帝国主义就宣布要在一九六八年给南也门“独立”。英帝国主义企图利用“联合国代表团”，在这个地区“协助组织选举”，安排英国的傀儡“南阿拉伯联邦”的“独立”。但是，这个“联合国代表团”遭到南也门人民的强烈抵制。
    在“联合国代表团”二日晚上到达亚丁当天，亚丁人民就开始举行声势浩大的总罢工和示威。抗议活动持续了许多天。在这期间，南也门民族主义者用手榴弹、步枪和自动武器加紧袭击英国殖民军。据报道，仅在三日和六日两天，民族主义者在亚丁袭击了英国殖民军一百二十多次。六日，英国殖民当局出动十二辆坦克到亚丁郊区的舍赫奥斯曼地区镇压，民族主义者进行了猛烈还击。同一天，在克拉特地区，示威者还向在空中盘旋的英国直升飞机射击。从二日以来，至少有十六名英国殖民军被打伤。
    在南也门人民的打击下，“联合国代表团”狼狈不堪，只能呆在靠海的一家有重兵把守的旅馆里，无法施展活动。五日，“联合国代表团”第一次走出旅馆到亚丁郊区的一所监狱去活动时，那里的政治犯向它示威，在监狱外，民族主义者袭击了前来镇压的英国殖民军，这个“联合国代表团”惊恐万状，最后不得不由直升飞机把他们送回旅馆。据宣布，“联合国代表团”原计划在亚丁活动几个星期，在南也门人民的抵制下，只得匆匆提前离开亚丁。
    在“联合国代表团”离开亚丁之后，英国外交部立即宣布派遣一名内阁大臣到亚丁，同英国驻亚丁高级专员一起加紧推行阴谋计划。
    被占领的南也门解放阵线总书记马卡维七日在开罗谴责英国利用“联合国代表团”作为英国在这一地区推行罪恶计划的工具。马卡维指出，
  “联合国代表团”决定离开亚丁是被占领的南也门人民进行武装斗争取得的一次胜利。
    马卡维在五日还说，英国及其在这个地区的傀儡玩弄的任何阴谋注定要失败。他说：南也门人民将毫不迟疑地粉碎目的在于损害南也门人民的正义事业的任何企图。
