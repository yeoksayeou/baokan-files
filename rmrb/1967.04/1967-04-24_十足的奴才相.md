The utter face of a lackey

The Soviet revisionist clique is so servile before the "big boss" of U.S. imperialism that even in trivial matters, their true colors are revealed.

Last summer, the Soviet revisionist clique had "protested" against U.S. planes' wanton bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by canceling a track and field meet between athletes of the Soviet Union and the United States. However, more than half a year has passed, and now they are apologizing and begging for forgiveness, agreeing to compensate the U.S. side with $100,000 in damages, and expressing their willingness to restore the "traditional" Soviet-U.S. track and field meet. This is truly the utter face of a lackey!

In fact, the Soviet revisionist clique's so-called "protest" action last year was merely a show, a deception. Your collusion with U.S. imperialism goes far beyond organizing a mere Soviet-U.S. track and field meet! The U.S. aggression and war "escalation" against Vietnam has never hindered your "comprehensive cooperation" and global collusion with U.S. imperialism. Moreover, the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, and their mad scheme of "bombing to force surrender," are all part of the collusion between you and U.S. imperialism. Can your partnership with U.S. imperialism be covered up by canceling a track and field meet?

Last year, you said you wanted to "protest" against the U.S. planes bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. However, this year, U.S. imperialism not only continues but also expands its aggression, yet you turn around and express your willingness to restore the Soviet-U.S. track and field meet to the U.S., even willing to pay money to beg for forgiveness. Isn't this even more proof that your "protest" last year was completely fake? Last year, you performed a farce, and this year, you perform an even more disgraceful act.

Wanting to be counter-revolutionary yet pretending to be revolutionary; wanting to play the villain yet pretending to be the hero. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique plays such a shameful role, and it is inevitable that they are full of contradictions and expose their ugly selves. Because, the nature of counter-revolution determines that they will, at critical moments, wipe off the thin layer of makeup they have applied, revealing their traitorous white faces. The $100,000 in compensation and the lowly apologies are but a small episode in their great betrayal.

    十足的奴才相
    苏修叛徒集团在美帝国主义“大老爷”面前是何等地奴颜婢膝，甚至在一些小事情上也暴露无遗。
    去年夏天，苏修集团曾经因为“抗议”美机猖狂轰炸河内、海防，而取消苏美两国运动员的一场田径比赛。不料，事情过去半年多了，现在他们却又赔礼求饶，答应愿向美国方面赔偿十万美元的损失，并且表示要恢复“传统的”苏美田径赛。这真是一副十足的奴才相！
    其实，苏修集团去年的所谓“抗议”行动，本来就是做做样子，骗人的。你们同美帝国主义的勾结，岂止是搞个什么苏美田径赛？美国对越南的侵略和战争“升级”，从来就没有妨碍你们同美帝国主义的“全面合作”和全球性勾结。而且，美国轰炸河内、海防，疯狂地玩弄“以炸迫降”的阴谋，就是美苏串通一气搞的。你们同美帝国主义的合伙关系，难道是取消一场田径比赛就能掩盖得了的吗？
    去年你们说是要“抗议”美国飞机轰炸河内、海防。然而，今年美帝国主义不仅继续而且扩大了这种侵略行动，你们却反而向美国表示要恢复苏美田径比赛，并情愿掏钱求饶。这不是更加证明你们去年的“抗议”完完全全是假的吗？去年你们表演的就是一幕丑剧，今年表演的更是丑上加丑。
    既要反革命，又要假装革命；既要唱白脸，又要装红脸。苏修领导集团扮演这样一个可耻的角色，注定他们不能不矛盾百出，丑态毕露。因为，反革命的本性决定了他们总是要在紧要关头抹去自己涂饰上去的一层薄薄的脂粉，而露出那一张叛徒的白脸来。十万美元的赔偿，低三下四地赔礼，不过是他们在大叛卖中一个小小的插曲而已。
