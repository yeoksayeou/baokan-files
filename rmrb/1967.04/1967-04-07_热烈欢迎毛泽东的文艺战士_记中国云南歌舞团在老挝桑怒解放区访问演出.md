The China Yunnan Song and Dance Troupe, commissioned by the seven hundred million Chinese people who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with deep affection for the Chinese people's resolute support of the Laotian patriotic military and civilians in their struggle against American aggression for national salvation, visited and performed in the revolutionary base of Sanu Liberation Zone in Laos from early November last year to February this year. Inspired by the unprecedented victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution, the troupe braved enemy bombing and overcame numerous difficulties to perform in various places.

Over three months, the troupe performed 47 times for government agencies, military units, schools, hospitals, factories, and rural areas, with approximately 22,000 people watching the performances. The programs, which shone with the light of Mao Zedong Thought, were highly praised by the military and civilians of the Sanu Liberation Zone.

Welcoming Chinese Comrades with Victory

The military and civilians of the Sanu Liberation Zone welcomed their close comrades with fervent hearts.

The Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Prince Souphanouvong, and the responsible officials of the Lao People's Liberation Army High Command, as well as representatives of the genuine neutral forces, all watched the performances. They enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong in socialist construction and socialist revolution.

The day after the troupe's arrival, young Lao anti-aircraft artillery soldiers shot down and damaged two American aggressor aircraft near the troupe's residence. The political instructor of a certain battalion of the anti-aircraft artillery, Kola, said: "The Chinese people have not only provided us with enormous material support in our struggle against American aggression for national salvation but have also given us spiritual support. You are performing for us at this most intense moment of battle. We, the anti-aircraft artillery, are determined to shoot down more American aggressor aircraft to welcome you."

Sincere Support

The Laotian patriotic military and civilians highly evaluated the visit and performance of the Song and Dance Troupe in the revolutionary base of the Sanu Liberation Zone. Prince Souphanouvong said: "Your performances are full of revolutionary content and are suitable for the thoughts of our cadres and soldiers. Although you are only thirty people, you represent the seven hundred million Chinese people supporting us." The highest commander of the Lao People's Liberation Army, Khamtai Siphandone, said, "You are performing for us at the most intense moment of war, which shows that the Chinese people are not only sincerely helping us with material support but also sincerely helping us with spiritual support." The deputy governor of Sanu Province, Khampheng, especially praised the performance of the female militia dance for its inspirational and mobilizing effect on the women of the liberation zone. He said, "Women especially like this program, and they are also planning to organize female militias."

Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!

The programs performed by the troupe, which shone with the light of Mao Zedong Thought, were extremely warmly welcomed by the military and civilians of the Sanu Liberation Zone. Many people, despite the enemy's fierce bombing, traveled from far away to watch the troupe's performance.

Soldiers of the Lao People's Liberation Army stationed in a certain place heard that the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe was coming to perform, and that night they walked fifteen kilometers, enduring two enemy air raids along the way, but finally arrived at the performance venue. Many farmers also walked tens of kilometers at night to watch the performance. The audience enthusiastically welcomed the troupe's performances of dances praising the Laotian national hero Xiong Tong, dances praising the Vietnamese military and civilians fighting against enemy aircraft such as "Number Two Gunner," "Beat the American Bastards," and "Combat Transport Team," and other programs. Many programs were repeatedly performed at the audience's request.

The audience enthusiastically praised the troupe's performances, which shone with the light of Mao Zedong Thought. A responsible official of the Lao People's Liberation Army Engineering Corps told a reporter after watching the performance: "The troupe's performance showed that Chairman Mao and the Chinese people are always concerned about the Laotian revolution, which has strengthened our fighting spirit. You have brought us Mao Zedong Thought. I want to shout, Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" A political instructor of a certain battalion of the Lao People's Liberation Army said, "The troupe's performance has inspired our fighting spirit and strengthened our confidence, which shows the correctness of Mao Zedong Thought. We will carry out the revolution according to Chairman Mao's teachings." An official of the Central Health Department of the Lao Patriotic Front said, "We Laotian military and civilians love Chairman Mao very much. We watch the performance not only to appreciate the art but also to learn the brilliant thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong." An official of the Lao People's Liberation Army said, "Your performance is the result of learning Mao Zedong Thought. We will use the gun to defend Mao Zedong Thought." The director of the Lao Cultural Troupe, Basak, said, "The performance of the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe has greatly inspired our troops and people. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon in the struggle against American aggression. Our people and cultural troupe members must also arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought." He also said, "We have seen with our own eyes the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's literary line during the visit and performance of the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe."

When the China Yunnan Song and Dance Troupe concluded their visit and performance in the Sanu Liberation Zone, the governor of Sanu Province, Tao Ma, warmly said to the troupe members at the farewell, "Let the peoples of China and Laos march forward forever on the road of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!"

    热烈欢迎毛泽东的文艺战士
    ——记中国云南歌舞团在老挝桑怒解放区访问演出
    中国云南歌舞团，受高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的七亿中国人民的委托，怀着中国人民坚决支持老挝爱国军民抗美救国斗争的深情厚意，从去年十一月初到今年二月，对老挝革命根据地桑怒解放区的英雄军民进行了友好访问和慰问演出。歌舞团在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利的鼓舞下，他们冒着敌机猛轰滥炸，克服许多困难，深入各地演出。
    三个多月中，歌舞团为机关、部队、学校、医院、工厂、农村共演出了四十七场，约有两万二千多人观看了演出。闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的节目，受到了桑怒解放区军民的热烈赞扬。
    用胜利来欢迎中国战友
    桑怒解放区军民以火热的心情欢迎自己亲密战友的到来。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王、老挝人民解放军最高指挥部的负责人和真正中立力量代表，都先后观看了演出。他们热烈赞扬中国人民在伟大的领袖毛泽东主席领导下，在社会主义建设和社会主义革命等方面取得的伟大成就。
    歌舞团到达的第二天，年青的老挝高射炮兵在歌舞团住地附近一举击落和击伤美国强盗飞机各两架。高射炮兵某营指导员高拉说：“中国人民对我们老挝人民抗美救国斗争，不仅给予巨大的物资支援，而且给予精神支援。你们在这战斗最激烈的时刻来为我们演出，我们高射炮兵决心打下更多的美国强盗飞机来欢迎你们。”
    真诚的支持
    老挝爱国军民对歌舞团到老挝革命根据地桑怒解放区访问演出，给予了极高的评价。苏发努冯亲王说：你们演出的节目充满了革命内容，适合我们的干部、战士们的思想。你们虽然只来了三十个人，却代表了七亿中国人民对我们的支持。老挝人民解放军坎代·西番顿最高指挥说，你们在战争最激烈的时刻来为我们演出，这表明中国人民不仅在物资上真心诚意地援助我们，而且在精神上也是真心诚意地援助我们。桑怒省副省长坎沛特别称赞歌舞团演出的女民兵舞对解放区妇女起到了鼓舞和动员作用。他说，妇女们特别喜欢这个节目，她们也正在计划组织起女民兵。
    毛泽东思想万岁！
    歌舞团演出的闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的节目，受到了桑怒解放区军民的极其热烈的欢迎。不少人不顾敌机疯狂轰炸，从远处赶来观看歌舞团的演出。
    驻防在某地的老挝人民解放军战士听说中国歌舞团来演出，当晚步行十五公里，途中冒着敌机两次轰炸，但终于赶到演出地点。许多农民也在夜间徒步十几公里赶来观看演出。观众们对歌舞团演出的歌颂老挝民族英雄西通的舞蹈、歌颂越南军民打敌机的舞蹈“二号炮手”、“痛打美国佬”、“战斗的运输队”等节目表示热烈欢迎。许多节目在观众要求下一再重演。
    观众热烈赞扬歌舞团演出的节目闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。老挝人民解放军工兵部队一位负责人在看了演出以后对记者说：“歌舞团的演出，表现了毛主席和中国人民时刻关心老挝革命，这使我们增强了斗争信心。你们给我们带来了毛泽东思想。我要高呼毛泽东思想万岁！”老挝人民解放军某营政治指导员说：“歌舞团的演出鼓舞了我们的斗志，增强了我们的信心，这说明毛泽东思想的正确。我们决心按照毛主席的教导去干革命。”老挝爱国战线党中央卫生部门的一位干部说：“我们老挝军民非常热爱毛主席。我们看演出，不仅是欣赏艺术，更重要的是学习毛泽东同志的光辉思想。”老挝人民解放军一位干部说，你们的演出“是学习毛泽东思想的结果。我们要用枪杆子来保卫毛泽东思想。”老挝文工团团长巴色说：“中国歌舞团的演出对我们部队和人民有很大鼓舞。毛泽东思想是反美斗争的强大的思想武器。我国人民和文工团员也要用毛泽东思想来武装自己。”他还说：“我们在中国歌舞团访问演出中，亲眼看到了毛泽东同志的文艺路线的正确。”
    中国云南歌舞团在结束对桑怒解放区的访问演出时，桑怒省省长陶马在送别歌舞团时亲切地向歌舞团的人员说：“让老中两国人民沿着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的道路永远前进！”
