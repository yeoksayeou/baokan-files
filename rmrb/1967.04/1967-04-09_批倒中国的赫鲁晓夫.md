The storm rises over Mount Zhong, a million heroes cross the Yangtze.
The journal *Red Flag* has published three articles: "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Personnel Issue Must Be Criticized," "Striking a Large Number and Protecting a Few is a Component of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line," and Comrade Chen Boda's "Patriotism or Treason?" These articles have sounded the battle cry for a total offensive against the top capitalist-roader in the Party, the Chinese Khrushchev! A massive revolutionary mass movement to bury the Chinese Khrushchev is rising across our great motherland.

Chairman Mao says: "History tells us that the correct political and military lines are not produced and developed naturally and peacefully, but are produced and developed through struggle. On the one hand, they must struggle against 'left' opportunism, and on the other hand, they must struggle against right opportunism. Without struggling against and thoroughly overcoming these harmful tendencies that harm the revolution and revolutionary war, the construction of the correct line and the victory of the revolutionary war are impossible." At every critical moment in the historical development, the top capitalist-roader in the Party has always stubbornly stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, proposing a set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, attempting to reverse the course of the Chinese revolution, and trying every means to lead the Chinese revolution astray.

Especially in the seventeen years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, he has used his usurped Party and government positions to intensify the implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, fiercely opposing the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. The heinous crimes he has committed against the Party and the people are truly "exhausting the bamboo of Mount Nan to write down the crimes without end; draining the waves of the East Sea to flow away the evil without end."

Chairman Mao points out: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for maintaining their power." The series of evil activities of the top capitalist-roader in the Party all boil down to one point: to restore capitalism, to usurp the Party and the government, to seize the power of the proletariat, and to rule the proletariat. If his plot succeeds, then the people's mountains and rivers will change color, the heads of millions of people will roll, the Marxist-Leninist Party will become a revisionist Party, a fascist Party, and the hard-won fruits of victory by countless revolutionary martyrs will be in vain.

In the seventeen years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the struggle between the two lines within our Party has been extremely fierce. Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao has, at every important historical juncture, engaged in resolute struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev, criticizing his revisionist line, steering the ship steadily, and ensuring that our country advances through the waves in the socialist direction! Now, the decisive moment to thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line and eliminate its poison has arrived. This is an unprecedented nationwide mass movement of great criticism and struggle. This struggle is a great struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a great struggle between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and revisionist thought, a great struggle between the restoration of capitalism and the proletariat's anti-restoration. Ultimately, it is a great struggle between capitalism and socialism over who will prevail.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own." Like all reactionaries in history, the Chinese Khrushchev will not fall unless he is beaten. We must pursue and attack him relentlessly, defeating him completely and leaving him with nothing!

To thoroughly overthrow the top capitalist-roader in the Party, the Chinese Khrushchev, we must mobilize the broad masses of revolutionaries. Only by mobilizing the broad masses of revolutionaries can we make a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, along with the top capitalist-roader in the Party who supports them, fall into the vast ocean of revolutionary masses, revealing their true colors, and exposing all the poison they have spread over the years to the light of day; only by mobilizing the broad masses of revolutionaries can we eliminate their poison, eradicate their influence, uproot the roots of revisionism, and prevent the restoration of capitalism.

To carry out this great criticism, we must first emphasize proletarian politics, firmly grasp the key issue of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the top capitalist-roader in the Party in terms of politics, ideology, and theory, eliminating its pernicious influence in all fields. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls, a great revolution to smash the old ideology of the exploiting classes and establish Mao Zedong Thought, and a great revolution to uproot the roots of revisionism in ideology. The current struggle to criticize the top capitalist-roader in the Party is a crucial and decisive battle.

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has, in the fields of politics, economy, culture, education, and various departments such as literature, history, philosophy, and economics, colluded with traitors, formed cliques, and protected and promoted a group of people, engaging in activities to restore capitalism. Only by thoroughly smashing the Chinese revisionist headquarters can we root out this group of reactionaries and complete the great historical mission of "fighting, criticizing, and transforming."

The Chinese Khrushchev is the creator of the bourgeois reactionary line in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This reactionary line, on the one hand, labels a large number of revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," and on the other hand, in personnel issues, "strikes a large number and protects a few." Only by thoroughly criticizing this reactionary line can we help the revolutionary thoughts of the proletarian revolutionaries, eliminate the poison of the reactionary line within the revolutionary ranks, and achieve the great unity of the revolutionaries. Only by thoroughly criticizing this reactionary line can we liberate a large number of cadres who have been struck down, better implement Chairman Mao's sole correct line on cadres, unite the majority, and strike down a few. On this basis, it is possible to achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

In the struggle to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, we must especially criticize his revisionist masterpiece: *Self-Cultivation*. This book, reprinted in 1962, is his general program for usurping the Party and the government, a declaration for restoring capitalism, and the theoretical basis for his creation of the bourgeois reactionary line. This book does not advocate revolution, class struggle, or proletarian dictatorship, but promotes the decadent bourgeois worldview and reactionary bourgeois idealist philosophy. It is a thoroughly anti-Marxist-Leninist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisonous weed. We must thoroughly and deeply criticize it!

The invincible and unyielding Mao Zedong Thought is our most powerful and sharpest weapon for carrying out this great criticism. In this current great criticism and struggle movement, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, push the movement to study Chairman Mao's works to new heights, turn our country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and let the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought forever illuminate the world.

Revolutionary workers, peasants, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary youth, and all revolutionary factions of the proletariat, let us, under the guidance of the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, overthrow the top capitalist-roader in the Party, the Chinese Khrushchev, and expose his crimes!

### 批倒中国的赫鲁晓夫

    批倒中国的赫鲁晓夫
    “钟山风雨起苍黄，百万雄师过大江。”
    《红旗》杂志发表的《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》《“打击一大片，保护一小撮”是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分》，以及戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》等三篇文章，吹响了向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派、中国的赫鲁晓夫发起总攻击的战斗号角！一场埋葬中国的赫鲁晓夫的空前规模的革命群众运动，正在我们伟大的祖国兴起。
    毛主席说：“历史告诉我们，正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。一方面，它要同‘左’倾机会主义作斗争，另一方面，它又要同右倾机会主义作斗争。不同这些危害革命和革命战争的有害的倾向作斗争，并且彻底地克服它们，正确路线的建设和革命战争的胜利，是不可能的。”长期以来，在历史发展的每一个关键时刻，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，总是顽固地站在资产阶级反动立场上，打着“红旗”反红旗，提出一整套反革命修正主义路线，同毛主席的无产阶级革命路线相对抗，妄图扭转中国革命的航向，千方百计地要把中国革命引向歧途。
    特别是中华人民共和国成立十七年来，他利用他所窃踞的党政要职，变本加厉地推行反革命修正主义路线，猖狂地反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想。他对党对人民犯下的滔天大罪，真是“罄南山之竹，书罪无穷；决东海之波，流恶难尽。”
    毛主席指出：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的一系列罪恶活动，集中到一点，就是要复辟资本主义，篡党、篡政，夺无产阶级的权，专无产阶级的政。如果让他的阴谋得逞，那末，人民的江山就要改变颜色，千百万人头就要落地，马克思列宁主义的党就会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，无数革命先烈用鲜血换来的胜利果实，就会付之东流。
    中华人民共和国成立十七年来，在我们党内，两条路线斗争是十分激烈的。我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席，在每一个重要历史关头，针锋相对地同中国的赫鲁晓夫展开了坚决的斗争，批判他的修正主义路线，掌稳了航船，保证我国沿着社会主义的方向，破浪前进！现在，彻底批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，肃清它的流毒的决战时刻，已经来到了。这是一场空前规模的全国性的群众性的大批判、大斗争。这场斗争，是无产阶级同资产阶级的大斗争，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同修正主义思想的大斗争，是资本主义复辟同无产阶级反复辟的大斗争。归根结底，是资本主义同社会主义谁战胜谁的大斗争。
    毛主席教导我们说：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”和历史上一切反动派一样，中国的赫鲁晓夫，也是不打不倒的。我们必须穷追猛打，打他个落花流水，片甲不留！
    要彻底批倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派、中国的赫鲁晓夫，就必须发动广大革命群众。只有发动广大革命群众，才能使一小撮反革命修正主义分子，以及背后支持他们的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派陷入革命群众的汪洋大海之中，才能使他们原形毕露，才能把他们长期以来所散布的大量毒素统统挖出来，暴露在光天化日之下；只有发动广大革命群众，才能肃清他们的流毒，铲除他们的影响，挖掉修正主义的根子，防止资本主义的复辟。
    要搞好这场大批判，首先必须突出无产阶级政治，必须紧紧抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争这个纲，从政治上、思想上、理论上，彻底批判以党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线，彻底肃清它在各个领域内的恶劣影响。无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，是大破剥削阶级旧思想，大立毛泽东思想的大革命，是从思想上挖掉修正主义根子的大革命。当前批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，是一个关系重大的决定性的战役。
    长期以来，中国的赫鲁晓夫在政治、经济、文化、教育等各个领域，在文化领域的文、史、哲、经等各个部门，招降纳叛，结党营私，包庇和扶植了一伙人，大搞资本主义复辟活动。只有彻底摧垮中国修正主义的总后台，才能把这一批反动的家伙挖出来，才能完成一斗二批三改的伟大历史使命。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，是无产阶级文化大革命中资产阶级反动路线的炮制者。这条反动路线，一方面把大批革命群众打成“反革命”，另一方面，在干部问题上，“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。只有彻底批判这条反动路线，才能有助于无产阶级革命派思想革命化，肃清反动路线在革命派内部的流毒，实现革命派的大联合。只有彻底批判这条反动路线，才能把受打击的大批干部解放出来，才能更好地贯彻毛主席的唯一正确的干部路线，团结大多数，打击一小撮。在这个基础上，才有可能实现革命的“三结合”。
    在批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的大斗争中，特别要批判他的修正主义代表作：《修养》。在一九六二年再版的这本书，是他篡党篡政的总纲领，是他搞资本主义复辟的宣言书，是他炮制资产阶级反动路线的理论基础。这本书，不要革命，不要阶级斗争，不要无产阶级专政，宣扬腐朽的资产阶级世界观，宣扬反动的资产阶级唯心主义哲学，是一株彻头彻尾的反对马克思列宁主义、反对毛泽东思想的大毒草。我们必须把它彻底批深，批透！
    战无不胜、攻无不克的毛泽东思想，是我们进行大批判的最强大最锐利的武器。在当前这场大批判、大斗争的群众运动中，我们必须更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把学习毛主席著作的群众运动，推向更新的高潮，把我国办成一个毛泽东思想的大学校，让毛泽东思想的万丈光芒，永远照耀全世界。
    革命的工人、农民、解放军指战员、革命干部、革命知识分子和革命青少年，一切无产阶级革命派，让我们在光焰无际的毛泽东思想指引下，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派、中国的赫鲁晓夫批倒，批臭！
                                                  （四月八日）
