I walked into the courtyard of Beijing Dongfanghong Middle School and was immediately captivated by the lively scene. Under the golden rays of spring sunshine, groups of energetic young men were either playing ball or practicing drills. They were jumping, running, and shouting across the courtyard.

Among the crowd, I found Li Zhang and Zhang Cheng, two students from the second-year class. I had heard that these two class brothers had a story of correctly resolving conflicts and strengthening unity after the resumption of classes and the revolutionary turmoil, in the context of denouncing the capitalist roaders within the Party who had formulated the bourgeois reactionary line.

The two of them, arms linked, walked out of the courtyard with smiles on their faces. After warmly shaking hands with me, they sat down on a patch of grass, wiping their sweat as they began to talk.

Li Zhang was the class's Communist Youth League branch secretary. He and Zhang Cheng had been very close, sharing a desk, studying Chairman Mao's works together, reviewing lessons together, and playing ball together. They were as close as brothers. After the Cultural Revolution began, they both responded enthusiastically to the Party and Chairman Mao's call, writing big-character posters day and night to attack the capitalist roaders within the Party. However, just as the movement was gaining momentum, the number one capitalist roader within the Party sent a work team, making all cadres step aside and directing their arrows at the general masses. Bold and daring Li Zhang couldn't hold back his anger and wrote a big-character poster questioning the work team, which he posted at the school gate. This immediately put them on high alert, and they quickly organized some students to attack Li Zhang, accusing him of having ulterior motives and being a "rightist element." Zhang Cheng, who was then a member of the class's core group, was deceived and also participated in the attack on Li Zhang. Their friendship was thus broken.

At that time, Zhang Cheng simply thought: The work team was sent by the Party Central Committee, so opposing the work team is opposing the Party Central Committee!

Soon, Zhang Cheng went out to link up with others. Later, he went to work in a factory. While studying the "Sixteen Points" and the editorial in _Red Flag_ magazine criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line with worker comrades, many issues began to stir his serious thoughts: Was I right in persecuting Li Zhang? He often tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. He tried hard to recall Li Zhang's "crimes" from when they were close, but he couldn't find any. Instead, he remembered: Li Zhang loved reading Chairman Mao's books and often discussed his study notes with him. He remembered: In 1965, when the U.S. imperialists set fire to North Vietnam, Li Zhang angrily told him, "Chenzi, I want to join the army to fight the U.S. imperialists and defend our country." Could such a person be a rightist? He gradually realized that he had been blinded by the work team's words, that it was slavishness that had harmed him. "Good! I'll write a letter to apologize to him." But every time he picked up his pen, he thought, "I attacked and persecuted him so much in the past. Will he easily forgive me?" So, he hesitated and the letter was never completed.

After the Party Central Committee issued the call to resume classes and make revolution, Zhang Cheng returned to school from the factory. As soon as he stepped into the school gate, which he had not seen for several months, he was shocked. The walls were covered with many big-character posters signed by the "Red Flag Combat Team." He inquired and found out that the leader of the "Red Flag Combat Team" was Li Zhang.

Zhang Cheng had originally planned to return and make a self-criticism, sincerely apologize to Li Zhang. But now, seeing the big-character posters, especially some of the more extreme words, his thoughts changed. He thought, "Are they going to persecute me like I persecuted Li Zhang in the past? Look, these big-character posters are just preparing public opinion!" So, he couldn't bear to read them and stormed back to the dormitory.

In fact, Li Zhang had no such intention. Ever since the call to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line was sounded, Li Zhang immediately rebelled and, together with other students, organized the "Red Flag Combat Team." Recently, after studying the editorials in issues three, four, and five of _Red Flag_ magazine, he believed that Zhang Cheng had only been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line and should be actively helped to recognize his mistakes. Posting a few big-character posters was to win him over and unite with him, not to persecute him. Therefore, as soon as he heard that Zhang Cheng had returned to school, he wanted to go find him for a heart-to-heart talk. But as soon as he reached the dormitory door, he was surprised to see Zhang Cheng sitting there, fuming. Seeing him, Zhang Cheng immediately turned his back and ignored him.

"What's this about?" Li Zhang wondered. He stood at the door for about a minute, hesitated for a moment, and finally turned back.

From then on, the two did not speak when they met. They used to share a desk, but now Zhang Cheng moved to an empty seat in the back, always with his head down, sulking. In the morning roll call, Li Zhang stood in the first row, and Zhang Cheng would definitely stand in the second row. If they played basketball, Li Zhang was on the court, Zhang Cheng would run away. They just couldn't get along. Every time the class had a meeting, Zhang Cheng thought, "Maybe they are going to persecute me!" But every time the meeting was held, not only was he not persecuted, but Li Zhang always led the class in reciting Chairman Mao's words: "Starting from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle, resolve contradictions, and thus achieve new unity on a new basis..." This gradually dispelled Zhang Cheng's fear of being persecuted.

On the evening of March 31, after the second-year students heard the commentary by the editorial board of _Red Flag_ magazine, "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line in the Personnel Issue Must Be Criticized," they immediately held a "Meeting to Denounce the Bourgeois Reactionary Line." It was at this meeting that Li Zhang's speech shocked everyone, especially Zhang Cheng. Li Zhang said: "...On August 17 last year, I heard that all the students in the school would go to Tiananmen Square to see Chairman Mao the next day, and I was so excited that I couldn't sleep all night. That night, I thought of my father who froze to death at the door of the capitalist, and my sister who was sold to the landlord because we couldn't afford to raise her. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, if it weren't for you, how could we poor people have today!" Saying this, Li Zhang's tears of excitement couldn't help but flow. "The next morning, I changed into a new set of clothes and went to school early to prepare to see our beloved leader, Chairman Mao. But before we set off, Zhang Cheng suddenly announced: The higher-ups have notified that Li Zhang and a few others cannot go. These words were like a thunderbolt from a clear sky hitting my head. Why was it only I, a poor child, who couldn't see our savior, Chairman Mao? On what grounds did they label me a 'rightist'? What crimes have I committed?" Saying this, Li Zhang could no longer hold back, and he struck the table with a fist. At this moment, the entire hall was silent, and Li Zhang's angry roar expressed the strong denunciation of many persecuted revolutionary youth against the bourgeois reactionary line. "That day, I didn't go home. I stood on the fourth-floor balcony of the classroom all day, always looking towards Tiananmen Square, looking and looking... listening to the distant shouts of 'Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!' and silently shouting 'Long live Chairman Mao' in my heart. I thought, Chairman Mao must see us, these persecuted children. Indeed, Chairman Mao saw us. He issued the great call to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line..."

"Classmates, I was wrong, criticize me!" Suddenly, a voice of excitement came from the back of the meeting. Everyone turned to look, and in the light, they saw Zhang Cheng standing up with tears in his eyes. He suddenly ran to the stage, tightly holding Li Zhang's hand, and tears dropped one by one: "Zhangzi, I was wrong, criticize me!"

"No!" Li Zhang interrupted Zhang Cheng's words: "Chenzi, the guilty one is not you, but the number one capitalist roader within the Party who proposed and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. You are a person who was deceived. You should immediately recognize your past mistakes, correct your mistakes, and firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary faction..."

"Yes!" Zhang Cheng said with tears in his eyes: "Classmates, now I see clearly. The 'strike a large number, protect a few' bourgeois reactionary line poisoned me. It was the number one capitalist roader within the Party's book _Self-Cultivation_ that harmed me. I will firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary faction, attack the big poisonous weed _Self-Cultivation_, attack the bourgeois reactionary line, and attack the number one capitalist roader within the Party!"

The hall erupted in a warm round of applause.

"Down with the number one capitalist roader within the Party!" Li Zhang led the charge, raising his arm.

"Down with the number one capitalist roader within the Party!"

Immediately, the hall erupted in a chorus of "Down with the number one capitalist roader within the Party!" The shouts echoed throughout the school and shook the night sky of Beijing.

    控诉
    袁东
    我走进北京东方红中学的操场，就被一片热气腾腾的景象吸引住了，在金闪闪的春天的阳光下，一群群生龙活虎的小伙子，有的在打球，有的在操练……他们在操场上跳跃着，奔跑着，呼喊着。
    在这些人群中间，我找到了高二班的李章和张成同学，因为听说这一对阶级兄弟，在复课闹革命后，在控诉党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所制定的资产阶级反动路线中，有一段正确解决矛盾，重新加强团结的故事。
    他俩手挽着手，笑嘻嘻地走出操场，热情地和我握手后，就在一块草地上坐下来，一边擦着汗，一边就跟我谈开啦！
    李章是班上的团支部书记，他和张成原来非常要好，两人共坐着一张课桌，两人经常在一起学习毛主席著作，在一起复习功课，在一起打球……简直如亲兄弟一般。文化大革命开始后，他俩积极响应党和毛主席的号召，不分日夜地一起写大字报，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开火。可是，正当运动搞得轰轰烈烈的时候，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派却派工作组来了，他们让所有的干部都靠边站，还把矛头指向一般群众。敢想敢闯的李章，这时气得憋不住了，他就独自写了张“质问工作组”的大字报，贴在校门口。这一下，他们如临大敌，立刻组织一部分同学围攻李章，说他“别有用心”，是“小右派”……李章的好朋友张成，当时是班上核心组的成员，他受了蒙蔽，也参加了对李章的围攻，两人的感情从此破裂了。
    张成当时只是按照一个简单的逻辑去想：工作组是党中央派来的，反工作组就是反党中央！
    不久，张成就外出串连去了。后来，又到工厂参加劳动。在他和工人同志一起学习“十六条”和《红旗》杂志批判资产阶级反动路线的社论时，许多问题才引起了他认真的思考：我过去整李章对吗？他经常在床上翻来复去地睡不着，他尽量想去搜索李章过去和他要好的时候，有些什么“罪行”，但是，一点也搜索不到，相反，他记起的是：李章是多么爱读毛主席的书呵！并且经常向他谈学习的心得。他记起的是：一九六五年，当美帝把战火烧向越南北方时，李章非常气愤地对他说：“成子，我想参军去，去打美帝，保卫祖国。”这样的人会是“右派”吗？他渐渐感到自己盲目地听了工作组的话，是奴隶主义害了他。“好！写封信向他认错。”可是，每提起笔来他又想，过去我那样围攻他，整他，他会轻易地原谅我吗？因此，刚写了个头又犹豫了，信始终没有写成。
    党中央发出复课闹革命的号召后，张成从工厂回到了学校。他一走进离开了几个月的学校门，就吃了一惊，墙壁上贴了他不少大字报，下面的署名是“红旗战斗队”。他一打听，好家伙，“红旗战斗队”的队长就是李章。
    张成本来打算回来作个检查，好好向李章认错的，可是，现在他一看大字报，特别是里面一些过火的话，他的想法又变了。他想，李章他们是不是又要象我过去整他一样地来整我？看，这些大字报不就是舆论准备吗？因此，他连大字报也看不下去了，就气冲冲地回到寝室。
    其实，李章完全没有这个想法。自从批判资产阶级反动路线的号角吹响以后，李章立刻造了反，并和其他同学组织了“红旗战斗队”。近来，他和战斗队的同志学习了《红旗》杂志三、四、五期社论后，认为张成只是受了资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽，应该积极地帮助他认识错误。贴了他几张大字报，也是为了争取、团结他，并没有整他的意思。因此，他一听说张成回校了，就想去找他谈谈心。可是，他刚走到宿舍门口，不禁吃了一惊，张成气呼呼地坐在那儿，见他来了，立刻把身子转过去，理也不理他。
  “这是为什么？”李章奇怪地想。在门口站了约一分钟，犹豫了一阵，终于转身退回来了。
    从此，两人碰面不说话。两人本来是共坐一个课桌的，现在张成坐到后面的空位子那儿去了，而且总是低着头，闷闷不乐。早上上操，李章站第一排，张成就必定站第二排。打篮球吧，李章在场，张成就跑了。两根弦总捏不到一块。每次班上开会，张成就想，可能要整我了吧！但每次开会，不但没有整他，李章每次都带头念毛主席这条语录：“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结……”这样，张成等着挨整的念头才慢慢打消了。
    三月三十一日晚上，当高二班同学从广播里听到《红旗》杂志评论员《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》一文以后，当晚，他们就开了一个“控诉资产阶级反动路线大会”。就在这次会上，李章同学的一篇讲话震动了大家，特别是震动了张成。李章说：“……去年八月十七日，我听说明天全校同学要到天安门去见毛主席，兴奋得整夜都没有睡着觉。那天晚上，我又想起了冻死在资本家大门口的爸爸，想起家里养不活、卖给了地主的姐姐，毛主席呵毛主席，要不是您老人家，我们穷人怎么会有今天！”说到这里，李章激动的泪水禁不住往下滴。“第二天清早，我就换了一身崭新的衣服，很早就赶到学校，准备去见我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席。可是出发前，张成却突然宣布：上面通知，李章等三人不能去。这句话，如一声晴天霹雳打在我的头上。为什么唯独我这个穷孩子，不能去见我们的救星毛主席？凭什么把我打成‘右派’，我到底有什么罪行？！”说到这里，李章再也抑制不住了，他含着愤恨的眼泪，猛然在桌子上“嗵”的击了一拳。此刻，全场一片静寂，李章愤怒的吼声，表达了许多受迫害的革命青少年对资产阶级反动路线的强烈控诉。“那天，我没有回家，我在教室四楼的楼台上站了一整天，一直望着天安门，望着，望着……听着远处一遍又一遍的‘毛主席万岁！’‘毛主席万岁！’的喊声，心里也默默地喊着毛主席万岁。我想，毛主席一定会看见我们这些受迫害的孩子的。真的，毛主席看见我们了，他老人家发出了批判资产阶级反动路线的伟大号召……”
      “同学们，我错了，批判我吧！”忽然，会场后面传来了激动的喊声。大家回头一看，灯光下，只见张成眼泪汪汪地站起来了，他忽然向台上跑去，紧紧抓住李章的手，眼泪一滴一滴地往下掉：“章子，我错了，你批判我吧！”
      “不！”李章打断张成的话说：“成子，有罪的不是你，而是提出和推行资产阶级反动路线的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。你是受蒙蔽的人，你应该马上认识过去的错误，改正错误，坚决站到革命派一边来……”
      “对！”张成眼泪汪汪地说：“同学们，现在我看清楚了。‘打击一大片，保护一小撮’的资产阶级反动路线毒害了我，是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派那本《修养》害了我。我要坚决站到革命派一边来，向大毒草《修养》开火，向资产阶级反动路线开火，向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派开火！”
    台下响起了一片热烈的掌声。
    “打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派！”李章带头振臂高呼。
    “打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派！”
    紧接着，台下爆发出一片“打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派”的喊声，那喊声震撼了整个校园，震撼了北京的夜空。
