Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries hold a symposium, exposing and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" pushed by the top capitalist-roaders within the Party, to better implement the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

New China News Agency, Shanghai, April 8th: The proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary youngsters, and broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai, holding high the great red banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary banner of the proletariat, are deeply criticizing the component of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" in the cadre issue, thoroughly eliminating the poison of indiscriminately rejecting and overthrowing all cadres.

After the publication of the editorial article "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Cadre Issue Must Be Criticized" by the editorial board of "Red Flag" magazine, representatives of the revolutionary factions from the Huangpu District Revolutionary Committee, Fudan University, the former Shanghai Municipal Party School, Shanghai Automatic Instrument Factory No. 3, and Shanghai Food Company held a symposium recently. They listed a large number of facts to expose and criticize the reactionary essence of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" pushed by the top capitalist-roader within the Party in the cadre issue.

"Striking down a large number and protecting a few" brazenly opposes Chairman Mao's cadre policy

In the cadre issue, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is completely opposed to the bourgeois reactionary line, and this struggle has been going on for a long time. Comrades participating in the symposium said, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to the cadre issue and placed the cultivation and training of a large number of cadres with both virtue and ability in a very important position. While the top capitalist-roader within the Party has always opposed Chairman Mao's correct line and has always excluded and struck down revolutionary cadres who are loyal to the Party, loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and dare to fight against them.

As early as thirty years ago, Chairman Mao taught us: "To lead a great revolution, one needs a great party, and one needs many excellent cadres." Soon after, the top capitalist-roader within the Party concocted the poisonous weed "On Cultivation," corrupting cadres and attempting to lead cadres down the revisionist path.

Comrades participating in the symposium said, Chairman Mao requires our cadres to "understand Marxism-Leninism, have political foresight, have work ability, be rich in spirit of sacrifice, be able to solve problems independently, remain steadfast in the face of difficulties, and work loyally for the nation, for the class, and for the Party." While the top capitalist-roader within the Party has been vigorously promoting the philosophy of survival, the philosophy of surrender, and the philosophy of betrayal, instructing others to write "confessions," issue "anti-communist statements," betray the Party, surrender to the enemy, and live in a cowardly manner, truly shameless to the extreme.

Comrades participating in the symposium especially pointed out that in dealing with cadres who have made mistakes, the top capitalist-roader within the Party brazenly opposes Chairman Mao's consistent advocacy of the policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the patient," advocating ruthless struggle and merciless strikes, hitting with one stick. Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the Twenty-Three Articles and the Sixteen Articles, both of which emphasize that the focus of the movement is to rectify those capitalist-roaders within the Party who are in power, ultimately achieving the unity of more than ninety-five percent of the cadres. While the top capitalist-roader within the Party confuses right and wrong, reverses black and white, and uses the evil means of "striking down a large number" to cover up a few counter-revolutionary revisionists to pass, what a poisonous heart!

"Striking down a large number and protecting a few" adapts to the needs of domestic and foreign class enemies, plotting to restore capitalism

Comrades participating in the symposium listed a large number of facts to expose that the "striking down a large number and protecting a few" pushed by the top capitalist-roader within the Party is completely to adapt to the needs of domestic and foreign class enemies, to restore capitalism in China, reactionary to the extreme. More than fifty percent of the section-level cadres in the units affiliated with the Shanghai Food Company were "sidelined" during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with a large number of "anti-party elements," "degenerate elements," and "bad elements"; in a grassroots department, out of fourteen section-level and division-level cadres, ten were struck down at once, while the real capitalist-roaders within the Party were not touched. A small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee closely followed the top capitalist-roader within the Party and wanted to promote their "experience of staying in the field" in Shanghai. They used the means of "striking a little," "touching a little," and "promoting a little" to protect the capitalist-roaders within the Party to pass, while creating white terror for revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, making everyone pass.

Everyone further recognized the reactionary nature of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" from these facts, further recognized the ugly face and wolfish ambition of the top capitalist-roader within the Party. They said, if we let the plot of the person who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line succeed, all real revolutionary cadres will be pulled down from their horses and sidelined; a small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party will continue to hold the leadership power, and the ghosts and monsters will come out of their holes, do evil, and in a short time, it will inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration, the Party and the country will perish, heads will roll, and the whole country will change color. We sternly warn this small group of people: in front of the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought, your plots will never succeed.

"Striking down a large number and protecting a few" sabotages the revolutionary "three-in-one combination"

Revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations participating in the Huangpu District Revolutionary Committee believe that "striking down a large number and protecting a few" is a thorough counter-revolutionary restoration program, its spearhead directly points to the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao, sabotaging the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries, making the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution come to a halt, with extremely evil intentions!

They said, in the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party loyally executed the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the top capitalist-roader within the Party, deceiving and misleading some cadres to attack the masses, inciting this part of the cadres to fight against that part of the cadres; later, when revolutionary cadres bravely stood up to rebel, and revolutionary mass organizations wanted to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" with them, this small group of people saw that their throne was no longer secure, so they manipulated some conservative forces behind the scenes, on the one hand, endlessly pulling and fighting those who wanted to stand up, on the other hand, spreading rumors, labeling revolutionary mass organizations that firmly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy as "high-level royalist organizations," inciting the masses to fight against the masses, muddying the waters, and watching the tiger fight from the mountain.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." In the temporary power organs of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" that we have established, revolutionary leading cadres play an important core and backbone role. Starting from his reactionary class nature, the top capitalist-roader within the Party also attaches importance to the "role" of their group of "cadres," attempting to stuff all big and small capitalist-roaders within the Party into the temporary power organs to achieve counter-revolutionary restoration.

"Striking down a large number and protecting a few" and uniting the majority, striking down a few, is a life-and-death struggle between two classes and two lines. Comrades participating in the symposium unanimously expressed that they will resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely rebel against a small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party, resolutely rebel against revisionism, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, resolutely unite the majority, and strike down a few

Comrades participating in the symposium happily talked about how, now, more and more cadres, with the help of the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary youngsters, have recognized their mistakes and stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, making a great comeback, uniting with the revolutionary masses, aiming upwards, and together rebelling against a small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party, jointly criticizing the reactionary "striking down a large number and protecting a few." However, that small group of people is most afraid of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and now they are playing new tricks, distorting facts, creating lies, and imposing the crime of "rejecting everything" and "overthrowing everything" on the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary youngsters. We proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary youngsters listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, our criticism of cadres who have made mistakes is severe, our attitude is sincere, and our purpose is to help them correct their mistakes, lighten their load, and fight the enemy together. For that small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, we must knock them down to the ground and step on them with one foot, making them never able to rise again.

They said, the top capitalist-roader within the Party is used to crying wolf. In the early days of the movement, these people incited the masses to fight against cadres one moment and then incited cadres to attack the masses the next, attacking the masses and then attacking the cadres, killing two birds with one stone. Now they want to sow discord between cadres and revolutionary youngsters, smear the revolutionary youngsters' faces, and obliterate the revolutionary youngsters' merits. This is absolutely not possible. We proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary youngsters will unite under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, better implement the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Do you want to kill two birds with one stone? We will make you "fail on both ends" and get nothing. We will make you collapse completely and perish completely!

Comrades participating in the symposium finally said: From the fact that the component of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" still has its market, it is even more necessary for us to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, carry out a thorough revolution in the depths of the soul, eliminate slavery and individualism, thoroughly eliminate the evil influence of the book "On Cultivation," accelerate the revolutionization of thought, strictly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao!

    深入批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线
    上海无产阶级革命派举行座谈，揭发批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派推行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，更好地实行革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”
    新华社上海八日电　上海的无产阶级革命派、革命小将和广大革命群众，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜，正在更深入地批判在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分，彻底清除对干部不分青红皂白，一概排斥、一概打倒的流毒。
    《红旗》杂志评论员文章《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》发表以后，上海黄浦区革命委员会、复旦大学、原中共上海市委党校、上海自动化仪表三厂、上海市食品公司等单位的革命派代表最近举行座谈会，他们列举大量事实，揭发和批判了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在干部问题上推行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这条资产阶级反动路线的反动本质。
    “打击一大片，保护一小撮”猖狂地同毛主席的干部政策相对抗
    在干部问题上，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线完全是针锋相对的，这场斗争由来已久。参加座谈会的同志说，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，几十年来一贯重视干部问题，把培养、造就大批德才兼备的干部放在极为重要的地位。而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，一贯对抗毛主席的正确路线，一贯排斥和打击忠于党、忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、敢于同他们这一小撮人作斗争的革命干部。
    早在三十年前，毛主席就教导我们：“指导伟大的革命，要有伟大的党，要有许多最好的干部。”为时不久，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却炮制出大毒草《修养》，腐蚀干部，妄图把干部引到修正主义的邪路上去。
    参加座谈会的同志说，毛主席要求我们的干部“懂得马克思列宁主义，有政治远见，有工作能力，富于牺牲精神，能独立解决问题，在困难中不动摇，忠心耿耿地为民族、为阶级、为党而工作。”而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却大肆宣扬活命哲学，投降哲学，叛徒哲学，指使别人写“自首书”，发表“反共启事”，叛党投敌，苟且偷生，真是无耻已极。
    参加座谈会的同志特别强调指出，在对待犯错误的干部的问题上，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，猖狂地反对毛主席一贯提倡的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，主张残酷斗争，无情打击，一棍子打死。毛主席亲自主持制定的二十三条和十六条，都强调运动的重点是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派，最后达到团结百分之九十五以上的干部。而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却混淆黑白，颠倒是非，用“打击一大片”的罪恶手段，包庇一小撮反革命修正主义分子蒙混过关，用心何其毒也！
    “打击一大片，保护一小撮”适应国内外阶级敌人的需要，阴谋复辟资本主义
    参加座谈会的同志列举大量事实揭露，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所推行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，完全为了适应国内外阶级敌人的需要，为了在中国复辟资本主义，反动透顶。上海市食品公司所属单位，在无产阶级文化大革命中，百分之五十以上的科级干部被“靠边”，什么“反党分子”、“蜕化变质分子”、“坏分子”一大片；一个基层部门，十四个科级、股级干部，一下子被打下十个，而真正的党内走资本主义道路的当权派却没有动。上海市委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，紧紧尾随党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，在上海也要搞个什么“蹲点经验”。他对党内走资本主义道路的当权派，用“打一打”、“摸一摸”、“提一提”的手段，保护过关；对革命干部、革命群众却制造白色恐怖，搞人人过关。
    大家从这些事实中，进一步认清了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动实质，进一步认清了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的丑恶面目，狼子野心。他们说，如果让提出资产阶级反动路线的某某人的阴谋得逞，真正的革命干部都要被拉下马，靠边站；党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派却继续把持着领导大权，牛鬼蛇神就会纷纷出笼，为非作歹，那不要很多时间，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，亡党亡国，人头落地，整个国家就要改变颜色。我们严厉警告这一小撮人：在用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众和革命干部面前，你们的阴谋是永远也不会得逞的。
    “打击一大片，保护一小撮”破坏革命的“三结合”
    参加黄浦区革命委员会的革命干部和革命群众组织的负责人认为，“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，是彻头彻尾的反革命复辟纲领，它的矛头直接指向伟大领袖毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”，破坏无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，使无产阶级文化大革命半途而废，用心极其恶毒！
    他们说，在无产阶级文化大革命初期，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，忠实地执行党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线，欺骗、蒙蔽一部分干部去整群众，挑动这部分干部去斗那部分干部；后来，当革命干部勇敢地站出来造反，革命群众组织要和他们实行革命“三结合”的时候，这一小撮人眼看自己的宝座保不牢了，就在幕后操纵一些保守势力，一方面无休止地揪、斗那些要站出来的革命干部，一方面散布流言蜚语，把坚决执行毛主席干部政策的革命群众组织，说成是“高级保皇组织”，再次挑动群众斗群众，把水搅混，自己坐山观虎斗。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”在我们已经建立的革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构中，革命的领导干部起着重要的核心作用和骨干作用。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，从他的反动阶级本性出发，也重视他们那一伙“干部”的“作用”，妄图把大大小小走资本主义道路的当权派，塞进临时权力机构，实现反革命复辟。
    “打击一大片，保护一小撮”和团结大多数，打倒一小撮，这是两个阶级、两条路线的一场你死我活的斗争。参加座谈的同志们一致表示，要坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒，坚决造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，坚决造修正主义的反，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，坚决团结大多数，打击一小撮
    参加座谈的同志高兴地谈到，现在，越来越多的干部，在无产阶级革命派、革命小将的帮助下，认识了错误，站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，大杀回马枪，和革命群众团结一致，矛头向上，一起造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，共同批判反动的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。可是，那一小撮人最害怕革命的“三结合”，现在又玩弄新的花招，歪曲事实，制造谎言，把对干部的“排斥一切”、“打倒一切”的罪名强加在无产阶级革命派和革命小将头上。我们无产阶级革命派和革命小将最听毛主席的话，对犯错误的干部，我们的批评是严厉的，态度是诚恳的，目的是为了帮助他们改正错误，轻装上阵，共同对敌。对那一小撮反革命修正主义分子，我们就是要把他们打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，使他们永世不得翻身。
    他们说，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是惯于贼喊捉贼的。运动初期，这些人一会儿挑动群众斗干部，一会儿又挑动干部整群众，整了群众又整了干部，一箭双雕。现在又想挑拨干部同革命小将的关系，往革命小将脸上抹黑，抹杀革命小将的功勋。这是绝对办不到的。我们无产阶级革命派和革命小将要在毛泽东思想的指引下，团结起来，更好地实行革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。你们想一箭双雕吗？我们叫你们“两头落空”，什么也捞不到。我们叫你们彻底垮台，彻底完蛋！
    参加座谈会的同志最后谈到：从“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分之所以还有它的市场来看，更需要我们活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，在灵魂深处大闹革命，打掉奴隶主义、个人主义，彻底肃清《修养》那本书的恶劣影响，加速思想革命化，不折不扣地执行毛主席的干部政策，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，永远做毛主席的好战士！
