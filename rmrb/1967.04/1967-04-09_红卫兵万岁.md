The Red Guards are a precious new phenomenon that emerged during our country's unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are the vanguard and pioneers of this great revolution, a vigorous and brave new force. As soon as they appeared, they received the attention, care, encouragement, and protection of Chairman Mao. The young Red Guards say that Chairman Mao is their red commander, and they are Chairman Mao's red soldiers. This is indeed the case. Over the past half year, they have made immortal contributions to the cause of the proletarian revolution. They have raised high the invincible banner of Mao Zedong Thought, marching from schools to the streets, embodying the daring spirit of the proletarian revolution—daring to think, dare to act, dare to break through, dare to make revolution, and dare to rebel. They have formed an irresistible revolutionary torrent, sweeping away all the dirt and filth left over from the old society, and cleaning up the garbage accumulated over thousands of years. Because of their daring spirit of thinking, acting, breaking through, making revolution, and rebelling, they often solve some old, difficult problems in the revolutionary movement that others cannot solve. Their most lovable and precious characteristic is that they love to read Chairman Mao's books the most, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions the most. As long as there is a word from Chairman Mao, they dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. This is the basic guarantee that they can grow and develop in the revolutionary furnace, forging themselves into selfless communists who benefit others and not themselves, and into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Chairman Mao has said to the youth: "The world is yours, it also belongs to us, but in the final analysis, it is yours. You young people are in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. The future is in your hands." He also said, "The world belongs to you. The future of China belongs to you." The young Red Guards are indeed the symbol of the future and hope of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

1967 is a year of comprehensive struggle between the two classes and the two roads throughout the country. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage. On the one hand, it must, under the guidance of the policy of "three-in-one combination" as indicated by our great helmsman Chairman Mao, carry out great unity, wage a struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and seize back all the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture from their hands. At the same time, in the minds of our revolutionary comrades, we must also wage a struggle to seize power, to seize the power of "self," to seize the power of all non-proletarian thoughts, to smash all the worldviews of the exploiting classes, to establish the worldview of the proletariat, and to establish the absolute leadership of Mao Zedong Thought over us. Chairman Mao teaches us: Marx pointed out that the proletariat can only achieve true liberation by helping all the people of the world to achieve liberation. This is the main spirit of the proletarian worldview. We must firmly plant this teaching of Chairman Mao in our minds.

To carry out a self-education and self-training, in order to better accomplish this glorious and arduous new combat mission, the young Red Guards are again opening their doors for rectification, using the sharp weapon of criticism and self-criticism to summarize the experience of revolutionary practice, to examine the shortcomings and errors that have appeared in the past period, and to bravely and firmly engage in a life-and-death struggle against certain non-proletarian thoughts in their minds, to seize the power of "self," to revolutionize themselves, and to transform their subjective world. This is a major revolutionary action in their "prime." We must cheer for them, learn from them, and pay tribute to them!

Different classes have different views and attitudes towards the revolutionary actions of the young Red Guards. We must be vigilant that there will be some counter-revolutionaries who regard the young Red Guards as thorns in their eyes and flesh in their bones. They will infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, attempt to exploit the loopholes in the "three-in-one combination" policy, fish in troubled waters, seize the fruits of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and carry out counter-revolutionary restoration. They will use the opportunity of the young Red Guards' open-door rectification to deny that their general direction is correct, to seize on their shortcomings or errors in specific work, even to exaggerate, distort, or fabricate lies, to slander and take revenge on them. This is another counter-attack by the class enemy, which should be immediately struck down.

It should also be noted that in our revolutionary ranks, there will be some whose worldviews have not been transformed, and who have been criticized by revolutionary comrades in the past. They will also use the opportunity of rectification to criticize the young Red Guards. This is also something we should be vigilant about. The young Red Guards have shortcomings and errors, and they should be criticized. They should be held to relatively strict standards. However, we must, as Chairman Mao has always taught, start from the position of loving and helping comrades, with full enthusiasm, actively and kindly, carry out criticism. In the revolutionary struggle, especially in a stormy mass movement like this Cultural Revolution, shortcomings or errors are inevitable. Moreover, the young Red Guards lack experience in struggle, and it is not surprising that they expose some shortcomings and make some errors. Isn't it clearly stated in the Sixteen Points? This great revolution can only be one where the masses liberate themselves; we must respect the masses' spirit of initiative; we must not be afraid of chaos; we must let the masses educate themselves in this great revolutionary movement, so that they can raise their consciousness and increase their abilities in the struggle. Currently, their open-door rectification is precisely a great practice of self-education, raising consciousness, and increasing abilities. Revolutionary comrades, especially the old cadres as revolutionary forerunners, should take on the responsibility of nurturing and protecting this batch of lovable and respectable young Red Guards, like gardeners cultivating young seedlings, nurturing them, protecting them, and doing their best to help them with patience and care.

In summary, the young Red Guards have emerged in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is a great and joyous event of epoch-making significance. It is a great new phenomenon that has shaken the entire society and the entire world. The future and hope of the proletarian revolutionary cause lie with them. What attitude we take towards them, and what attitude we take towards their shortcomings or errors, is the touchstone of whether a person is truly revolutionary or not, whether they truly support Chairman Mao or not, and whether they raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought or not.

"Though the enemy encircles us on all sides, we stand firm and unyielding." All class enemies and old forces are paper tigers. They may appear to be formidable, but in reality, their vitality is waning, and they are a bunch of walking corpses about to be buried. Their hysterical cries do not indicate their strength; they are merely a last struggle. The truly powerful are the masses of the people, the new generation armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We believe that the young Red Guards will definitely, in this rectification movement, make a firm resolution, uphold the truth, correct errors, and strive for new and greater victories. They will definitely learn to swim and learn revolution in this great storm of the revolution.

Let us shout:

Long live the Red Guards armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, ten thousand times long live, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao!

    红卫兵万岁
    潘梓年
    红卫兵是我国这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中产生出来的十分珍贵的新生事物，是这次大革命的尖兵、闯将，是一支朝气蓬勃、英勇善战的新生力量。她刚一出现，就受到了毛主席的重视、关怀、鼓励和爱护。红卫兵的小将们说，毛主席是他们的红司令，他们是毛主席的红小兵。事实的确是如此。半年多以来，他们已为无产阶级的革命事业立下了不朽功勋。他们高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，由学校走上街头，发扬了敢想、敢干、敢闯、敢革命、敢造反的无产阶级革命精神，形成了一股不可抗拒的革命洪流，荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的一切污泥浊水，清扫着几千年堆积起来的垃圾脏物。由于他们这种敢想、敢干、敢闯、敢革命、敢造反的无产阶级革命精神，在革命运动中往往有一些老大难的问题，别人无法解决，他们一到就解决了。他们最可爱、最可宝贵的特点是：最爱读毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话，最能照毛主席的指示办事。只要有毛主席的一句话，他们就刀山敢上，火海敢闯。这就是他们能在革命熔炉里不断成长、发展，把自己锻炼成为专门利人、毫不利己的共产主义者，成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人的基本保证。毛主席曾对青年们说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上”。又说：“世界是属于你们的。中国的前途是属于你们的。”红卫兵小将们就正是无产阶级革命事业的未来和希望的象征。
    一九六七年是两个阶级、两条道路在全国展开全面斗争的一年，无产阶级文化大革命已进入了一个新的阶段。它一方面要在我们的伟大舵手毛主席所指示的革命的“三结合”这个方针指导之下进行大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行夺权斗争，把一切党、政、财、文大权通通从他们手里夺回来，同时，在我们革命派的脑子里，也要进行夺权斗争，夺“私”字的权，夺一切非无产阶级思想的权，大破一切剥削阶级的旧世界观，大立无产阶级的新世界观，大立毛泽东思想对我们的绝对领导权。毛主席教导我们：马克思指出，无产阶级只有帮助全世界人民获得了解放，才能使自己得到真正的解放。这就是无产阶级世界观的主要精神。我们一定要把毛主席这个教导牢牢地扎根在自己脑子里。
    为了进行一次自我教育，自我整训，以便更好地完成这一光荣而艰巨的新的战斗任务，红卫兵小将们又在开门整风，用批评和自我批评这一锐利武器，总结革命实践的经验，检查过去一段时间内出现过的一些缺点和错误，勇敢而坚强地向自己头脑中某些非无产阶级思想进行刺刀见红的斗争，夺“私”字的权，革自己的命，改造主观世界。这是他们“正在兴旺时期”的一个重大的革命行动。我们要向他们欢呼，向他们学习，向他们致敬！
    对红卫兵小将们这种革命行动，不同的阶级有着不同的看法，不同的态度。我们必须警惕，会有一些把红卫兵小将看做眼中钉、肉中刺的反革命分子，他们混进革命队伍，企图钻“三结合”政策的空子，混水摸鱼，要篡夺无产阶级文化大革命的果实，要实行反革命复辟，就利用小将们开门整风的机会，否定他们的大方向是正确的，揪住他们在具体工作中的某些缺点或错误不放，甚至加以夸大、歪曲，乃至无中生有，造谣、污蔑，对他们实行阶级报复。这是阶级敌人的又一次新反扑，应该立即给以迎头痛击。
    还须提到的是，在我们革命队伍中，也会有一些世界观还没有改造好，过去曾受到革命小将指责的人，这次也会利用整风机会来整他们一下。这也是值得我们警惕的。小将们有缺点，有错误，应当批评，应当对他们有比较严格的要求。但是，一定要如毛主席所一向教导的那样，从爱护同志，帮助同志的立场出发，抱着满腔热忱，积极地、善意地进行批评。在革命斗争中，特别是在疾风骤雨式的象这次文化大革命这样的群众运动中，缺点或错误是不可避免的。何况小将们还缺乏斗争经验，暴露出一些缺点，犯了一些错误，一点也不足奇怪。十六条中不是说得很明白吗？这次大革命只能是群众自己解放自己；要尊重群众的首创精神；不要怕出乱子；要让群众在这个大革命运动中自己教育自己，这样来使他们在斗争中提高觉悟，增长才干。目前他们开门整风，这就是自己教育自己，提高觉悟，增长才干的伟大实践。革命的同志们，特别是作为革命前辈的老干部们，应当对这一批可爱可敬的小将们负起抚育、爱护的职责，象园丁培植幼苗那样，抚之，翼之，尽心竭力，对他们做耐心细致的帮助。
    总之，红卫兵小将们在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中崭露头角，是具有划时代意义的一件大喜事，是震动了整个社会、整个世界的伟大新事物，无产阶级革命事业的未来和希望就寄托在他们身上。对他们采取什么态度，对他们的某些缺点或错误采取什么态度，是一个人到底是真革命还是假革命，是真的拥护毛主席还是假的拥护毛主席，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗还是不高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的试金石。
      “敌军围困万千重，我自岿然不动。”一切阶级敌人，一切旧势力，都是纸老虎。他们看起来还是一个庞然大物，貌似强大，但实际上他们的血气已衰，是就要进棺材的一堆行尸走肉。他们那种歇斯底里的叫喊，并不表示他们有力量，只是一种最后的挣扎。真正有力量的是人民大众，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的新生一代。我们相信，红卫兵小将们一定能在这次整风运动中，痛下决心，坚持真理，修正错误，去争取新的更大的胜利，一定能在这次革命的大风大浪的游泳中学会游泳，学会革命。
    让我们高呼：
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵万
  岁！
    我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟
  大的舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！！
