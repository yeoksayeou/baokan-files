Firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call to support the military and love the people. The military loves the people, the people support the military, and the military and the people are forever united in heart.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on April 28, after the editorial "Eagerly Respond to the Call to Support the Military and Love the People" from the sixth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine reached various places, it sparked widespread enthusiasm. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres enthusiastically praised the great achievements and new great contributions made by the People's Liberation Army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They said that this editorial fully expresses what is in our hearts. We wholeheartedly support and admire the great People's Liberation Army.

Revolutionary cadres from Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong, Shanxi, Guizhou, and Heilongjiang provinces and municipalities said after reading this editorial that it conveys the latest instructions from our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao. We enthusiastically support and resolutely carry out these instructions. They said that the People's Liberation Army is the great revolutionary army personally created by our great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao. It is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the strong backing of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat. Without the army, we would have nothing. We must humbly learn from the comrades of the army and resolutely and actively support and assist them in carrying out their revolutionary actions in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. We must ensure that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is carried through to the end.

The Red Guards of the Beijing Huabei Metal Structure Factory achieved great victories in their struggle for power with the strong support of the army. They said, "Without a people's army, there would be nothing for the people." We are determined to unite more closely with the army to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Members of the command center for production and revolution on the front lines of the Xinghuo People's Commune in the Beijing suburbs said that poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres all regard the army as their own kin. The class enemies fear and hate the army the most, so we must resolutely stand with the army and fight shoulder to shoulder to smash the plots and tricks of the class enemies. Today, the revolutionary young fighters of Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School held a meeting to support the military and love the people together with the comrades of the army. The revolutionary young fighters joyfully said that the army strongly supports the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, and the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat deeply love the army. We will forever learn from the great People's Liberation Army of China.

The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Shanghai pointed out that the great People's Liberation Army has made great achievements in the past revolutionary struggles and has made great contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are the best examples for us to learn from. The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat of the Shanghai Flour Mill said that at the most critical moment of struggle in our factory, the People's Liberation Army came to the factory. They firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and gave the class enemies a heavy blow. After the People's Liberation Army entered the factory, they brought us the experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and passed on to us the fine traditions of insisting on the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style. This greatly raised the class consciousness of the revolutionary masses and further strengthened the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of our revolutionary cadres of the proletariat.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in Jinan unanimously agreed that this editorial expresses the feelings of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat. It is excellent and wonderful! We support it a thousand times and will carry it out a thousand times! Revolutionary worker Fang Liheng of the Jinan Pharmaceutical Factory excitedly said, "When drinking water, do not forget the well-digger; when gaining freedom, do not forget the army. We loved the army in the past, we love the army now, and we will love the army in the future. We will forever love the army and forever be united with the army in heart!" The responsible person of the Red Guards Shandong Command said, "We will definitely fight alongside the People's Liberation Army, win together, and will not allow the representatives of the bourgeoisie to sow discord and separate the blood relationship between the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the People's Liberation Army of China." The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in Qingdao said that the comrades of the army have countless good points worth learning from, but the most fundamental one is that they hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, which is the most worth learning from.

Commissioner Deng Wenqiang and Deputy Commissioner Chen Guozhen of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and the Revolutionary Rebel Unified Command of the Xishan Mining Area excitedly said, "Without the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, there would be no victory in our struggle for power. We must cherish the People's Liberation Army as we cherish our eyes. Whoever directs the spear of struggle at the People's Liberation Army, we will fight to the end with them." Revolutionary young fighters preparing for the Shanxi "Red Congress" said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Without a people's army, there would be nothing for the people.' This is an absolute truth. We must firmly support the People's Liberation Army and humbly learn from the army."

The revolutionary workers of the Guizhou Railway Bureau said that the greatest help the People's Liberation Army has given us is to bring the experience of emphasizing politics and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to bring the fine traditions of insisting on the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style, and to bring high organizational discipline and order. With the strong support and help of the army, it has promoted the thought revolutionization of our revolutionary ranks. The revolutionary young fighters of Guizhou Girls' Middle School said that the attitude towards the army is the attitude towards the dictatorship of the proletariat. We revolutionary young fighters love the army the most, support the army the most, trust the army the most, and rely on the army the most, and we resolutely learn from the army.

The Red Guards of the Harbin Bearing Factory in Heilongjiang Province excitedly said, "Wherever the comrades of the army go, they spread Mao Zedong Thought, and wherever they go, they bring the fine traditions of the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style. Where the tasks are heavy, they rush to; we workers have as much oil on us as they do. We will continue to fight alongside the comrades of the army and win together." The revolutionary young fighters of the Harbin Military Engineering Academy said, "Chairman Mao instructs us to believe in and rely on the masses, believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres. We will resolutely carry out these three beliefs and three reliances without wavering!" The broad masses of revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in the Beiman Steel Plant held a rally and parade with over 3,000 people today, unanimously expressing their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, to enthusiastically support the army, actively assist the army, and humbly learn from the army.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on April 28, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and Shandong joyfully responded to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to support the military and love the people, and enthusiastically welcomed the publication of the editorial "Eagerly Respond to the Call to Support the Military and Love the People" from the sixth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine. They unanimously agreed that the publication of this editorial at the time of launching a general offensive against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party is of extremely important significance. It will surely promote the unity of the military and the people across the country under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, mutual learning, mutual support, and the completion of the great historical tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform.

Recently, Chairman Mao instructed us to believe in and rely on the masses, believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres. The broad masses of officers and soldiers are determined to engrave these three beliefs and three reliances of Chairman Mao in their hearts and put them into action. They said, "The military loves the people, the people support the military, and the military and the people unite as one. Let's see who can stand against us!"

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison and the troops stationed in Beijing, who guard our great leader Chairman Mao, excitedly said, "The military loves the people, the people support the military. This is Chairman Mao's consistent teaching and the fundamental guarantee of our victory. We are the people's children created by Chairman Mao. We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call." Comrade Liu Daluan, a member of the Communist Party and deputy squad leader of a certain unit, who was selected as a member of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee after saving Red Guards, said, "We will definitely fight alongside the broad masses of revolutionaries, firmly defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Five-good soldier and air communication officer Sun Jinliang said, "Supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training are the new historical tasks given to us by Chairman Mao. There will be new problems in the work, and there may be this or that shortcoming. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, 'For the people's interests, persist in what is good, and correct what is wrong,' and complete Chairman Mao's glorious tasks."

The editorial from the sixth issue of the *Red Flag* reached the birthplace of the "January Storm." The propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought supporting industrial production of the troops stationed in Shanghai immediately organized study and discussion. The officers and soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison Area said in the discussion, "The unity of the military and the people is an important guarantee for the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat to seize power and consolidate the power they have seized. Therefore, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party hate and fear the unity of the military and the people to death. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' In the future work, we will definitely unite and fight alongside the broad masses of revolutionaries and revolutionary cadres, win together."

The officers and soldiers of the Shanxi Military Region and the troops stationed in Shanxi held extensive discussions. Soldiers Song Jilin and Ren Zhenrong said, "We must rely on the masses in supporting the left, supporting industry, and supporting agriculture, respect the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses, firmly and powerfully support their revolutionary actions, and give the handful of class enemies a heavy blow." Five-good soldier Liu Guangtian said, "What the revolutionary masses think and worry about is the power issue. We must firmly support them in seizing the power of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and actively help them to hold and use the power well. What the revolutionary masses love is Mao Zedong Thought. We must wholeheartedly help them study and apply Chairman Mao's works."

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Guizhou Military Region, who have made new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, said in the discussion, "The contributions we have made in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Guizhou area are the result of firmly responding to Chairman Mao's great call to support the leftist masses. In the future, we must be humble and cautious, and conscientious." Recently, the officers and soldiers have seriously summarized the experience and feelings of supporting the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat.

The officers and soldiers of a certain unit stationed in Heilongjiang were greatly inspired after listening to the broadcast. Deputy Platoon Leader He Yuanshun of the unit where Liu Yingjun was formerly stationed and his comrades said in the discussion, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The army must blend with the people.' We will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be like the good son of the people, Liu Yingjun, thinking what the people think and worrying about what the people worry about. With the greatest effort, the highest initiative, and the newest attitude, we will do the work of loving the people better and better, and respond to Chairman Mao's great call with practical actions."

The officers and soldiers of the "Second Daizui" Company of a certain unit of the Jinan troops executing the task of supporting the left said, "Since its establishment, our army has been following Chairman Mao's instructions to blend with the people, growing from small to large and from weak to strong, becoming the unique people's army in the world. The more intense the class struggle, the more we must unite closely with the revolutionary masses and be connected in heart." Today, the troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qingdao held a rally and parade with the revolutionary masses to celebrate the publication of the *Red Flag* editorial. The leading organs of the troops immediately issued instructions to support the government and love the people. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit's First Company, which has been rated as a four-good company for six consecutive years, said in the discussion, "The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat are the bravest and most selfless, and are our best teachers. We must respectfully learn from them, learn from their boundless love, belief, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought; learn from their most distinct and firm class stance; learn from their daring to think, speak, act, and break through, daring to smash the old world and build a new world; learn from their self-revolutionary spirit of regarding themselves as a part of the revolution and continuously regarding themselves as the object of the revolution; learn from their humble, cautious, and unarrogant style."
