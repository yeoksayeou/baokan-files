The revolutionary Red Guards of Shanghai No. 6 Girls' Middle School have achieved great unity throughout the school while conducting a great criticism and struggle against the capitalist roaders in power within the Party and their representative's reactionary bourgeois line. This once again proves that the revolutionary movement of great criticism can greatly promote great unity. We hail the revolutionary Red Guards of No. 6 Girls' Middle School for uniting in the common struggle. We hope that more revolutionary Red Guards, teachers, staff, and revolutionary cadres in other schools will quickly unite in this current mass movement of great criticism.

The experience of No. 6 Girls' Middle School shows that the reactionary bourgeois line is the main obstacle to achieving great unity at present. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the top capitalist roader within the Party, in order to protect a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, has put forward the reactionary bourgeois line. They have shifted the direction of the struggle, pointing the spearhead of the struggle at the revolutionary masses. They have also used the reactionary bloodline theory of the exploiting class to deceive some students, causing them to be at odds with other students. Therefore, in some schools, students are at odds with each other, teachers are at odds with students, and the situation has been split for a long time. The poison of this reactionary bourgeois line has not yet been thoroughly eliminated in the schools, and it is still influencing and obstructing the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses in various ways. Some revolutionary mass organizations are still fighting "internal wars" without principles. The facts are clear: only by thoroughly criticizing the reactionary bourgeois line and eliminating its poison can the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses be truly achieved.

In criticizing the reactionary bourgeois line in schools, the focus must be directed upward, aiming straight at the top capitalist roader within the Party. It is he, in collusion with another top capitalist roader within the Party, who proposed this reactionary bourgeois line. It is under his support that a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists used the reactionary bloodline theory to poison many young students. He is the backer of all capitalism, revisionism, and ghosts and monsters in our country, and the public enemy of the 700 million people of our country. Thoroughly criticizing the series of reactionary fallacies of this Chinese Khrushchev, achieving great unity in the great criticism, and seizing power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party—this is the current direction of the struggle for revolutionary teachers and students. The revolutionary students of No. 6 Girls' Middle School initially did not firmly grasp this direction of the struggle and were unable to unite. Sometimes, people were in the same class but their hearts were in different places, they couldn't sit together, talk together, and even ignored each other. Through joint exposure, criticism, and accusation of this Chinese Khrushchev and his representative's reactionary bourgeois line, the revolutionary students realized that their enemy was not the originally conservative students but the top capitalist roader within the Party; the originally conservative students also realized that the revolutionary students were the resolute executors of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, while they had been poisoned by the reactionary bourgeois line. Whether revolutionary students or originally conservative students, everyone was a victim of the reactionary bourgeois line. Finding the common enemy, unifying the direction, in this great criticism, clarifying right and wrong, understanding thoughts, raising awareness, and eliminating mutual misunderstandings, they thus united.

Revolutionary great unity can only be achieved through common struggle. Great unity first requires political and ideological unity. This great criticism movement is a great ideological revolution. Chairman Mao said: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without elimination, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." In this great criticism, it is necessary to break down and establish. Break down capitalist and revisionist thoughts, and establish Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary students of No. 6 Girls' Middle School actively participated in this mass great criticism movement, using Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to powerfully criticize the top capitalist roader within the Party and his representative's reactionary bourgeois line, thus laying a solid ideological foundation for great unity. For the proletarian revolutionary masses, in this mass great criticism and struggle, it is necessary to touch the soul deeply, sweep away all non-proletarian ideological consciousness, and strive to achieve ideological revolutionization. Through common struggle, great unity achieved in the process of breaking down and establishing is a true and solid revolutionary great unity.

Some people say that criticizing the top capitalist roader within the Party and his representative's reactionary bourgeois line should be implemented in the originally conservative mass organizations and in the students of the classes. This is an incorrect idea. Criticism must be implemented, and this implementation means that this great criticism must be closely combined with the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the local area, department, and unit, and combined with the struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the local area, department, and unit, to cut off the black hands of the top capitalist roader within the Party extending into various fields, and at the same time raise the level of struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit. If the criticism is implemented in the past conservative mass organizations and in the students of the classes, this would be directing the spearhead downward again and persecuting the masses. This is exactly what the proposers of the reactionary bourgeois line hope for, and we must not fall for it. For the shortcomings and errors of revolutionary teachers and students, criticism and self-criticism can be used to achieve the goal of "clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades." In any case, the spearhead of the struggle must not be directed at the revolutionary masses.

Revolutionary great criticism has promoted revolutionary great unity; achieving revolutionary great unity will greatly advance the movement of revolutionary great criticism. With a unified revolutionary organization, uniting the majority, with unified steps and concentrated firepower, the combat effectiveness will be greatly enhanced. Thoroughly defeating this Chinese Khrushchev is a tough battle, and it must rely on the unity of the 700 million people and tenacious struggle to achieve victory. Chairman Mao said: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the fundamental guarantees for the success of our cause." To defeat the common enemy, we must quickly unite and struggle together.

    再论在大批判中推进大联合
    上海《文汇报》四月九日社论
    上海市第六女中革命红卫兵，在对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其代表的资产阶级反动路线进行大批判、大斗争中，实现了全校革命的大联合。这又一次证明：革命的大批判运动，可以大大推动革命的大联合。我们欢呼市六女中的革命红卫兵在共同的斗争中联合起来了，我们希望更多学校的革命红卫兵、革命师生员工以及革命领导干部，在当前这场群众性的大批判运动中尽快地联合起来。
    市六女中的经验说明，资产阶级反动路线是当前实现大联合的主要障碍。在这次文化大革命中，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，为了保护一小撮反革命修正主义分子过关，抛出了资产阶级反动路线。他们转移斗争的大方向，把斗争的矛头，指向革命群众。他们还利用剥削阶级的反动血统论，欺骗少数学生，来同另一部分学生闹对立。因此，在一些学校中，学生与学生之间，教师与学生之间，长期处于分裂状态。这条资产阶级反动路线的流毒，至今还没有在学校中彻底肃清，它还在各个方面影响和阻碍着无产阶级革命派的大联合，有些革命群众组织之间至今还在打无原则的“内战”。事实很清楚，只有彻底批判了资产阶级反动路线，肃清了它的流毒，才能真正实现无产阶级革命派的大联合。
    在学校中批判资产阶级反动路线，必须矛头一致向上，直指党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。因为就是他伙同另一个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，提出了这条资产阶级反动路线。就是在他的支持下，一小撮反革命修正主义分子利用反动的血统论，毒害了不少青年学生。他是我国资本主义、修正主义和一切牛鬼蛇神的总后台，是我国七亿人民的公敌。彻底批判这个中国的赫鲁晓夫的一系列反动谬论，在大批判中实现大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，这是当前革命师生斗争的大方向。市六女中的革命学生，开始由于没有紧紧把握住这个斗争大方向，始终联合不起来。有时，人在班级，心各一方，坐不拢、谈不来，甚至互不理睬。通过共同揭发、批判、控诉这个中国的赫鲁晓夫及其代表的资产阶级反动路线，革命派学生认识到，自己的敌人并不是原来保守的学生，而是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派；原来保守的学生也认识到，革命派的学生是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的坚决执行者，而自己是受了资产阶级反动路线的毒害。无论革命派学生或原来保守的学生，大家都是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。共同的敌人找到了，大方向一致了，在这场大批判中，明辨了是非，弄清了思想，提高了觉悟，相互消除了隔阂，于是就联合起来了。
    革命的大联合，只有在共同的斗争中才能实现。大联合，首先需要政治思想上的大统一。这场大批判运动，是一场思想大革命运动。毛主席说：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。在这场大批判中，就是要大破大立。大破资本主义、修正主义思想，大立毛泽东思想。市六女中革命学生积极参加这场群众性的大批判运动，用毛泽东思想这一锐利武器，有力地批判了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及其代表的资产阶级反动路线，就为大联合建立牢固的思想基础。对无产阶级革命派来说，在这场群众性的大批判、大斗争中，要狠触灵魂，横扫一切非无产阶级思想意识，努力实现思想革命化。通过共同的斗争，在大破大立中实现的大联合，才是真正的巩固的革命的大联合。
    有人说，批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及其代表的资产阶级反动路线，要落实到原来保守的群众组织，落实到班级里的学生。这是一种不正确的想法。批判当然要落实，这个落实，就是指这次大批判一定要同本地区、本部门、本单位的斗、批、改任务紧密结合起来，同斗争本地区、本部门、本单位的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派结合起来，以斩断党内头号走资本主义道路当权派伸向各个领域的黑手，同时又把各单位的斗、批、改提到更高的水平。如果把批判落实到过去保守的群众组织，落实到班级里的学生，这岂不是又把矛头向下，又去整群众了吗？这恰恰是资产阶级反动路线提出者所希望的，我们万万不要上当。对于革命师生的缺点、错误，可以通过批评与自我批评，达到“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的目的。在任何情况下都不能把斗争矛头指向革命的群众。
    革命的大批判促进了革命的大联合；实现了革命的大联合，又将大大地推动革命的大批判运动。有了统一的革命组织，团结了大多数，步伐一致，火力集中，就大大增强了战斗力。彻底打倒这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，这是一场硬仗，必须依靠七亿人民团结一致，顽强战斗，才能取得胜利。毛主席说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”为了打败共同的敌人，我们一定要赶快联合起来，团结起来，共同进行斗争。
