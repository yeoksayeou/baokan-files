The great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line
— Warmly celebrating the birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee

    The winds of Mount Zhongshan rise with a yellow hue,
    A million heroic troops cross the great river.
    The tiger crouches, the dragon coils, today surpassing yesterday,
    The world is turned upside down, and the sentiment is profound.

    Under the warm care of our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, Chairman Mao, and under the radiant light of the invincible and boundless Mao Zedong Thought, during the decisive stage of the proletarian revolutionary masses' total assault on the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been born!

    This is a great joy for the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Beijing!

    This is a great joy for the people of the entire nation!

    This is a great joy for the revolutionary people of the whole world!

    Beijing is the capital of our heroic motherland, the place where our great leader Chairman Mao resides, and the birthplace of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    Beijing stands proudly in the East, radiating the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, guiding the revolutionary ship of the world to break through the waves and advance.

    Beijing is the holy land for spreading Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a beacon and hope for the world revolution.

    The people of the nation and the revolutionary people of the world gaze day and night at Beijing, at the reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, listening to the battle calls and the voice of truth from our great leader Chairman Mao in Beijing.

    The birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and a great victory won by the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of the entire city under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao after arduous struggles.

    It is the great leader Chairman Mao, with the greatest courage and breadth of a great proletarian revolutionary, who personally initiated and led the unprecedented and world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He personally decided to publish the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in the 1960s—the Declaration of the Paris Commune of the 20th Century, igniting the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, pushing the international proletarian revolutionary movement to a higher stage.

    It is the great leader Chairman Mao who exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party who supported them from behind, foiling their evil plot to usurp the Party and the state, and shattering their dream of restoring capitalism in China by subverting proletarian dictatorship.

    It is the great leader Chairman Mao who, at a critical juncture when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was facing the threat of being strangled by the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, personally presided over the convening of the historic and significant Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, formulated the brilliant "Sixteen Points," declared the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line, and pointed out the correct direction for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    It is the great leader Chairman Mao who first supported the great Red Guard movement and the nationwide revolutionary tour, receiving the Red Guard youths and revolutionary students from all over the country in Beijing multiple times, sparking a high tide of criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line in Beijing and across the country, and creating a great situation for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    It is the great leader Chairman Mao who called on the proletarian revolutionary masses to unite and seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, launching a red storm of the "January Revolution" that shook the world across the country.

    It is the great leader Chairman Mao who proposed that in places and units where power needs to be seized, the principle of revolutionary "three-in-one combination" must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. This power organ is best named the Revolutionary Committee.

    It is the great leader Chairman Mao who issued the battle call to the proletarian revolutionary masses to attack the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, pushing the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new stage.

    It is the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that gave the proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing the confidence and strength to win, enabling them to overcome countless difficulties, smash the enemy's repeated counterattacks, seize one position after another, grow and strengthen their forces in the storm of class struggle, and achieve the great victory of seizing power on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, with the support of the People's Liberation Army, realizing revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," forming a mighty revolutionary army, and finally winning the great victory of seizing power.

    As we joyfully celebrate the birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, we shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! Long live our most beloved leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years! We sincerely wish our reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

    The birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing uniting to seize power from the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee. It announces the complete collapse of the reactionary rule of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee!

    The old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, which was long occupied by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, with the support of the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, catered to the needs of domestic and foreign class enemies, usurped the Party, government, economic, and cultural power in Beijing, turning Beijing into their counter-revolutionary base to oppose the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. They fiercely attacked our great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

    They brazenly opposed our great leader Chairman Mao, viciously attacked the great Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely opposed the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, peddling the revisionist goods advocated by the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, such as "class cooperation," "class struggle extinguished," and "peace within the Party," advocating "peaceful evolution" and implementing capitalist restoration.

    They faithfully executed the revisionist organizational line of the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, recruiting traitors, forming cliques, networking everywhere to recruit ghosts and snakes, placing their trusted followers, protecting landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and suppressing the proletarian revolutionary masses, turning Beijing into an "impenetrable" independent kingdom.

    Under the indulgence of the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, they used a group of reactionary literati and the newspapers, magazines, radio, books, lectures, films, dramas, and literary works they controlled to spread the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, fiercely preparing public opinion for their subversion of proletarian dictatorship and restoration of capitalism.

    The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party who supported them from behind are time bombs planted next to Chairman Mao, public enemies of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world! Their crimes are heinous, and their sins are countless!

    Is this tolerable?!

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has sounded the death knell for the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party.

    On June 3, 1966, the Party Central Committee reorganized the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, forming the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee. This was the first great victory for the proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing in their struggle to seize power from the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee under the support of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

    However, the main leaders of the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee completely betrayed the trust of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and the ardent expectations of the revolutionary people of Beijing. They did not execute the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, mobilize the masses, and launch a bottom-up struggle to seize power, thoroughly smashing the reactionary rule of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee. Instead, they faithfully executed the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, causing great losses to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing.

    Chairman Mao said: "The people, and only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." Vice Chairman Lin said: "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and inspired by the "Sixteen Points" personally presided over by Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing displayed the great revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to revolt, and dare to rebel, breaking through the constraints and encirclement of the bourgeois reactionary line, launching a struggle to continue seizing power from the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee from the bottom up. The new Beijing Municipal Party Committee, which faithfully executed the bourgeois reactionary line, was finally swept away by the mighty torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. A revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat—the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee—was born!

    The birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, this event of great historical significance, will be recorded in golden letters in the glorious annals of the Chinese revolution and the international communist movement.

    The birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee marks a new great victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing and heralds the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing. Our great leader Chairman Mao said on the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China: "The Chinese people will see that once the fate of China is in the hands of the people themselves, China will, like the sun rising in the East, illuminate the world with its brilliant light, quickly sweep away the muddy water left by the reactionary government, heal the wounds of war, and build a new, strong, and genuine People's Republic." Seventeen years of history have fully proven Chairman Mao's wise foresight. Now, when the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is born, when the proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing truly begin to grasp their own fate, when we review our battle journey and look forward to the victorious future, we reaffirm Chairman Mao's teaching, with blood boiling and confidence surging.

    The proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing will continue to advance along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, thoroughly smash the ruling machine of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and thoroughly criticize and purge the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee in all fields; at the same time, according to the different situations of various departments and units, gradually turn to the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their own units, in order to more thoroughly expose and more deeply criticize the poison spread by the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee on various fronts, and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on every front. The proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing should actively respond to the call for supporting the army and loving the people, learn from the great People's Liberation Army. The proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing should firmly support the power organ of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, further establish proletarian revolutionary discipline, uphold proletarian revolutionary authority, overthrow anarchism, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, seize the revolution and promote production, and win greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction.

    The proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing will certainly use the wisdom inspired by the great Mao Zedong Thought to create many miracles in human history that are currently unimaginable but completely in accordance with the laws of historical development!

    The proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing will certainly remember the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, the future is bright, the road is tortuous, the victory we have achieved today is only the first step of the long march; we will face even more arduous and great battle tasks in the future. We will certainly hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing to the end, build Beijing into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, build it into the reddest city in the world, and make the greatest contribution to the international proletariat and the revolutionary people of the world!

    We are not only good at destroying an old world, we will also be good at building a new world.

    Our goal will be achieved!

    Our goal will definitely be achieved!

    毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利
    ——热烈欢呼北京市革命委员会诞生
    钟山风雨起苍黄，百万雄师过大江。
    虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。
    在我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席的亲切关怀下，在战无不胜的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在无产阶级革命派向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派发动总攻击的决战阶段，北京市革命委员会诞生了！
    这是北京市无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的大喜事！
    这是全国人民的大喜事！
    这是全世界革命人民的大喜事！
    北京，是我们英雄祖国的首都，是我们伟大领袖毛主席居住的地方，是史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的发源地。
    北京，巍然屹立在世界东方，放射出毛泽东思想的万丈光芒，照耀着世界革命的航船破浪前进。
    北京，是传播马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的圣地，是世界革命的灯塔和希望。
    全国人民、全世界革命人民日日夜夜仰望着北京，仰望着我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，聆听着伟大领袖毛主席从北京发出的战斗的号召，真理的声音。
    北京市革命委员会的诞生，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是全市无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在毛主席的英明领导下经过艰苦斗争赢得的伟大胜利。
    是伟大的领袖毛主席，以最伟大的无产阶级革命家的胆略和气魄，亲自发动和领导了史无前例的、震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，亲自决定发表全国第一张马列主义的大字报——二十世纪六十年代北京公社宣言书，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，把国际无产阶级革命运动推向了一个更高阶段。
    是伟大的领袖毛主席，识破了旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团和背后支持他们的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派妄图篡党、篡国的罪恶阴谋，粉碎了他们颠覆无产阶级专政、在中国复辟资本主义的迷梦。
    是伟大的领袖毛主席，在无产阶级文化大革命面临着被党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所提出的资产阶级反动路线扼杀的严重关头，亲自主持召开了具有伟大历史意义的党的八届十一中全会，制定了光辉的十六条，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产，给无产阶级文化大革命指出了正确的方向。
    是伟大的领袖毛主席，首先支持了伟大的红卫兵运动和全国革命大串连，在北京多次接见了全国各地的红卫兵小将和革命师生，掀起了北京市和全国范围内批判资产阶级反动路线的高潮，使无产阶级文化大革命出现了一派大好形势。
    是伟大的领袖毛主席，号召无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，在全国范围内掀起了震撼世界的“一月革命”的红色风暴。
    是伟大的领袖毛主席，提出在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的“三结合”的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。
    是伟大的领袖毛主席，向无产阶级革命派发出了讨伐党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的战斗号召，把波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命，推向一个崭新的阶段。
    是伟大的领袖毛主席，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，给北京市无产阶级革命派必胜的信心和巨大的力量，使他们能够战胜重重困难，粉碎敌人的一次次反扑，夺取一个个阵地，在阶级斗争的暴风雨中锻炼成长起来，发展壮大了自己的队伍，在毛泽东思想的基础上，在中国人民解放军的支持下，实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，终于取得了夺权斗争的伟大胜利。
    在我们为北京市革命委员会的诞生纵情欢呼的时候，我们千遍万遍地高呼：战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！我们衷心地祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    北京市革命委员会的诞生，是北京市无产阶级革命派联合起来，向旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团夺权的伟大胜利。它宣告了旧北京市委反动统治的彻底垮台！　
    被一小撮反革命修正主义分子长期盘踞的旧北京市委，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，迎合国内外阶级敌人的需要，窃夺了北京市的党、政、财、文大权，把北京市作为他们反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的反革命基地，疯狂地攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。
    他们猖狂地反对我们的伟大领袖毛主席，恶毒攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，疯狂反对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，竭力推行反革命修正主义路线，大肆贩卖党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所宣扬的“阶级合作”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“党内和平”那一套修正主义货色，大搞“和平演变”，实行资本主义复辟。
    他们忠实执行党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的修正主义组织路线，招降纳叛，结党营私，四处网罗牛鬼蛇神，安插亲信，包庇地、富、反、坏、右分子，打击无产阶级革命派，把北京市变成一个“针插不进，水泼不进”的独立王国。
    他们在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的纵容下，利用一批反动文人，利用他们把持的报纸、刊物、广播、书籍、讲坛、电影、戏剧、文学作品……，大肆散布封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的毒素，猖狂地为他们颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义作舆论准备。
    旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子和背后支持他们的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是埋在毛主席身边的定时炸弹，是中国人民和世界革命人民的公敌！他们罪恶滔天，恶贯满盈，罄竹难书！
    是可忍，孰不可忍！？
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，敲响了旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团和党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的丧钟。
    一九六六年六月三日，党中央改组了旧北京市委，组成了北京新市委。这是北京市无产阶级革命派在毛主席和党中央支持下向旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团进行夺权斗争的第一个巨大胜利。
    但是，北京新市委的主要负责人完全辜负了毛主席和党中央的信赖，辜负了北京市革命人民的殷切期望。他们没有执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，放手发动群众，发动一个自下而上的夺权斗争，彻底砸碎旧北京市委的反动统治机器。相反，他们在无产阶级文化大革命中，忠实执行了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线，给北京市的无产阶级文化大革命造成了巨大的损失。
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”林副主席说：“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头。”北京市无产阶级革命派在毛主席革命路线的指引下，在毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条的鼓舞下，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢革命、敢造反的大无畏革命精神，冲破了资产阶级反动路线的束缚和围剿，开展了一场自下而上地向旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团继续夺权的斗争。忠实执行资产阶级反动路线的北京新市委终于被强大的无产阶级文化大革命的洪流冲垮了。一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构——北京市革命委员会诞生了！
    北京市革命委员会的诞生，这一具有伟大历史意义的事件，将用金光灿烂的大字载入中国革命和国际共产主义运动的辉煌史册。
    北京市革命委员会的诞生，标志着北京市无产阶级文化大革命取得了新的伟大胜利，预示着北京市无产阶级文化大革命必将取得彻底胜利。我们伟大的领袖毛主席在中华人民共和国成立的前夕说：“中国人民将会看见，中国的命运一经操在人民自己的手里，中国就将如太阳升起在东方那样，以自己的辉煌的光焰普照大地，迅速地荡涤反动政府留下来的污泥浊水，治好战争的创伤，建设起一个崭新的强盛的名副其实的人民共和国。”十七年的历史，已经完全证明了毛主席的英明预见。现在，当北京市革命委员会诞生的时候，当北京市无产阶级革命派真正开始掌握自己的命运的时候，当我们检阅战斗历程，展望胜利前程的时候，我们重温毛主席的这一教导，热血沸腾，信心倍增。
    北京市无产阶级革命派一定继续沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底砸烂旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的统治机器，彻底批判和肃清旧北京市委反革命修正主义路线的一切流毒；同时，要根据各个部门、各个单位的不同情况，逐步地转入本单位的斗、批、改，以便更充分地揭露、更深入地批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以及旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团在各个战线上散布的毒素，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍各个阵地。北京市无产阶级革命派要积极响应拥军爱民的号召，向伟大的中国人民解放军学习。北京市的无产阶级革命派要坚决拥护北京市革命委员会这个权力机构，进一步建立无产阶级的革命纪律，树立无产阶级的革命权威，打倒无政府主义，巩固无产阶级专政，抓革命、促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设的更大胜利。
    北京市无产阶级革命派一定会用伟大的毛泽东思想所启发起来的智慧，创造出在人类历史上许多为目前人们还意料不到、但又是完全合乎历史发展规律的新奇迹！
    北京市无产阶级革命派一定牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，前途是光明的，道路是曲折的，我们今天取得的胜利，只是万里长征的第一步；我们今后面临着更加艰巨、更加伟大的战斗任务。我们一定更高更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把北京市的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把北京市建设成毛泽东思想的大学校，建设成世界上最红最红的城市，为国际无产阶级和全世界革命人民，作出最大的贡献！
    我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。
    我们的目的一定要达到！
    我们的目的一定能够达到！　　　　（四月二十一日）
