In a hospital in Guangzhou, where he is recuperating, naval combat hero Mai Xiande, while studying the article "Patriotism or Treachery?" from the *Red Flag* magazine, angrily shouted, "Overthrow the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road!" Together with the medical staff, he studied this article and bravely joined the fierce battle against the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road.

According to the regulations, Mai Xiande is only allowed half an hour of study time each day, but he insisted on not resting and demanded that the nurse finish reading the article. He listened intently the whole time. Whenever the nurse read about the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road's heinous crimes of opposing Chairman Mao, his bright eyes flashed with anger, and he clenched his fists and shouted slogans. He angrily said, "The top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road is the biggest traitor. Overthrow the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road! Defend the Party Central Committee, defend Chairman Mao!" After the nurse finished reading the sections "How to Deal with Imperialist Aggression?" and "How to Deal with the Revolutionary Masses of the Boxer Rebellion?", he loudly shouted, "Down with imperialism, down with counter-revolutionary revisionism! The revolutionary mass movement is excellent!"

After the entire article was read, Mai Xiande indignantly said, "The film *The Last Emperor* is a big poisonous weed and must be thoroughly criticized!" "Exposing the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! We must resolutely overthrow, smash, and disgrace the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road." After saying this, he raised his arm with the medical staff and shouted, "Firmly support the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! Whoever opposes Chairman Mao should be overthrown!"

Later, Mai Xiande wrote forcefully in his notebook: Expose the top party cadre who is taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticize, thoroughly smash, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end! Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!

    谁反对毛主席就打倒谁
    麦贤得向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火
    新华社广州八日电　在广州某疗养院疗养的海军战斗英雄麦贤得，学习《红旗》杂志《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》文章时，愤怒高呼：打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派！他与医务小组的同志一起学习了这篇文章，勇敢地投入了向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火的战斗。
    按规定，麦贤得每天只有半个小时的学习时间，可是他坚决不肯休息，一定要护士把这篇文章读完。他一直聚精会神地听着。每当护士读到党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反对毛主席的滔天罪行时，他的明亮的眼睛里，闪着怒火，并捏紧拳头高呼口号。他愤怒地说：“党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是最大的卖国主义者。打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派！保卫党中央，保卫毛主席！”当护士读完
  “怎样对待帝国主义的侵略？”和
  “怎样对待义和团的革命群众运动？”这两节以后，他大声高呼：
  “打倒帝国主义，打倒反革命修正主义！”“革命群众运动好得很！”
    全文读完后，麦贤得愤慨地说：“影片《清宫秘史》是株大毒草，必须彻底批判！”“揪出党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！一定要坚决地把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒，斗垮，斗臭。”说完，他与医务小组的同志一起振臂高呼：“坚决拥护以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！谁反对毛主席就打倒谁！”
    后来，麦贤得又在他的笔记本上有力地写道：揪出党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，彻底批判，彻底打垮，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！！
