The leaders of the National Liberation Front of Occupied South Yemen resolutely oppose the United Nations' interference in South Yemen and are determined to continue armed struggle until all traces of colonialism are completely eliminated from South Yemen.

The General Secretary of the National Liberation Front of Occupied South Yemen, Makawi, recently told Xinhua News Agency in Cairo, the capital of the United Arab Republic: "The United Nations is a tool of Western imperialist aggression. Britain's attempt to use the United Nations to maintain its colonial interests in South Yemen is merely a futile fantasy. We will never allow the tragedy of Congo (Leopoldville) in 1960 to be repeated in South Yemen."

Makawi recently analyzed the situation in South Yemen and said: "British and American imperialism are currently plotting a fake independence scheme in South Yemen, aiming to establish a puppet government in 1968 to maintain their military and economic interests there."

Makawi emphasized: "The National Liberation Front of Occupied South Yemen will not lay down its arms until all traces of colonialism and British bases in various parts of South Yemen are completely eliminated."

The commander of the National Liberation Front of Occupied South Yemen, Abdullah Majali, recently told Xinhua News Agency in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen: "We have achieved great victories in our armed struggle against British imperialism. The guerrilla forces on all fronts have developed significantly. Nationalist fighters, with the help of the people, are becoming stronger and stronger. They can even openly attack British colonialists on the streets of Aden."

Majali, when discussing the resistance against the "UN delegation" scheduled to arrive in Aden in early April, said: "We are determined to liberate Occupied South Yemen with our own blood and will not accept any mediation or negotiations."

Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam: The Tanzanian newspaper "Nationalist" published an editorial on March 30, exposing that Britain is currently plotting to use the United Nations and UN troops to intervene in the affairs of Occupied South Yemen, suppress the national liberation struggle, and maintain its puppet regime.

The editorial said that British newspapers recently showed extreme enthusiasm for the so-called "UN delegation" and suggested deploying a "UN peacekeeping force" in Aden. The editorial asked, what kind of "peace" does Britain intend to maintain by sending this "UN peacekeeping force" there?

The editorial also pointed out that Britain's purpose in setting up the "Federation of South Arabia" in Occupied South Yemen is to hand over power to its puppet regime after "independence" in the region, thereby maintaining Britain's oil interests in the Persian Gulf (Arabian Gulf) and serving as a supply base for Britain's military adventurism "east of the Suez Canal."

    坦桑报刊揭露英国利用联合国镇压南也门民族解放斗争
    新华社讯　被占领的南也门解放阵线的领导人坚决反对联合国插手南也门，决心坚持武装斗争直到彻底清除殖民主义在南也门的一切痕迹。
    被占领的南也门解放阵线总书记马卡维最近在阿联首都开罗对新华社记者说：“联合国是西方帝国主义的一个侵略工具。英国企图利用联合国来维持它在南也门的殖民利益，只不过是痴心妄想。我们决不允许一九六○年的刚果（利）悲剧在南也门重演。”
    马卡维最近在分析南也门的局势时还说：英、美帝国主义正在南也门加紧策划假独立的阴谋，企图在一九六八年建立傀儡政府，以保持它们在南也门的军事和经济利益。
    马卡维强调指出：“被占领的南也门解放阵线决不放下武器，直到殖民主义的一切痕迹和在南也门各地的英国基地被彻底清除时止。”
    被占领的南也门解放阵线指挥官阿卜杜拉·马贾利最近在也门首都萨那对新华社记者说：“我们在反对英帝国主义的武装斗争中赢得了伟大的胜利。各条战线上的游击队都得到了很大的发展。民族主义战士在人民的帮助下越战越强。他们甚至能够公开地在亚丁街头袭击英国殖民主义者。”
    马贾利在谈到抵制“联合国代表团”将于四月初到亚丁活动时说：“我们决心用自己的鲜血解放被占领的南也门，决不接受任何调解和谈判。”
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》三月三十日发表社论，揭露英国目前正在阴谋利用联合国和联合国军队干预被占领的南也门的事务，镇压民族解放斗争和保持其傀儡政权。
    这篇社论说，英国报刊最近对所谓“联合国代表团”表现出极端热情，并献策要在亚丁驻扎一支“联合国维持和平部队”。社论问道，英国究竟要派这种“联合国维持和平部队”去那里维持什么样的“和平”？
    社论还指出，英国之所以在被占领的南也门拼凑起“南阿拉伯联邦”，其目的在于，在这个地区“独立”以后，好把权力交给其傀儡政权，以保持英国在波斯湾（阿拉伯湾）的石油利益，以及为英国的“苏伊士运河以东”军事冒险政策充当补给站。
