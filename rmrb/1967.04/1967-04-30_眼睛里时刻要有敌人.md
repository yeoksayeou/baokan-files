The class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat are the essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and they are the key to observing and analyzing everything. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In our country, although the socialist transformation, in terms of ownership, has been basically completed, and the large-scale, stormy class struggles of the revolutionary period have basically ended, the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador class still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. The class struggle has not ended. 'The question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved.' Therefore, Chairman Mao repeatedly instructs us: never forget class struggle. However, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party deliberately sings the opposite tune, viciously attacking the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and vigorously promoting the theory of the extinction of class struggle. He maliciously says that 'the enemies have been almost eliminated,' 'the main class struggle within the country has basically ended... the contradictions between enemies and us have basically been resolved.' He also goes to great lengths to whitewash the exploiting class, saying things like 'today's capitalists are new-style capitalists in joint state-private enterprises,' 'after the joint state-private enterprises, the capitalists have handed over the factories, except for a very few individuals, they no longer want to resist socialism.' In short, the class struggle has been extinguished.

Are the enemies really almost eliminated? Has the class struggle really been extinguished? No, this is all deceitful talk. Since 1951, I have been working in Rongjiang County, Guizhou Province. Over the past decade of struggle, I have summarized my experience into one sentence: 'Always keep the enemy in mind.' I deeply understand that the class struggle has not been extinguished; it remains complex and sharp. The class enemies always dream of restoring capitalism. In Rongjiang County, Longtu Commune, Zaimen Brigade, the landlord Liang Lifeng was a fake township head. In 1962, when he was dying, he gave his son a book he had kept for more than a decade, detailing his plans for a counter-revolution, along with two land deeds he had secretly copied during the land reform. He instructed his son to avenge him. His son later colluded with some landlords and rich peasants to engage in sabotage activities, becoming an active counter-revolutionary. The reactionary nature of the class enemies is like this; they will never change until they die.

Over the past decade, the class enemies in the Rongjiang area have launched wave after wave of ferocious attacks against the proletariat. They have used every trick and method. If we relax even a little, the enemy will find a way in. In Rongjiang County, Guandong Commune, Guandong Brigade, there was a landlord who, during the three years of natural disasters in our country, rallied a group of ghosts and snakes. With the support of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, he stirred up a evil wind in the local area. They sabotaged collective production, slaughtered the plow oxen of the production teams, and advocated for the division of production to households. For a time, things became chaotic, and even phenomena like hiring labor and usury appeared. This brigade had eleven production teams, and ten of them had their collective production sabotaged. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants saw through the class enemies' plots, united, and resisted this evil wind. However, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the original Rongjiang County Committee praised the class enemies' sabotage and even specially summarized the 'superiority' of the division of production to households, promoting it everywhere. Our county's Military Affairs Department, following the instructions from higher authorities, organized a work team to go to Guandong to correct this trend of individual farming. Just as we, relying on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen, fully mobilized the masses to repel the class enemies' attacks, a capitalist-roader in power within the Rongjiang County Committee rushed over to stop us, threatening us, saying: 'If you correct individual farming, the people will run away!' We fought back against him resolutely, driving him away on the spot. Later, the broad masses were mobilized, struggled against the landlord who led the trouble, and smashed the enemy's attempt to restore capitalism, restoring collective production. The people did not run away but became even more determined to follow the socialist path, and production flourished.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the class enemies are also stirring. In one place, landlord and rich peasant elements who had infiltrated our ranks also organized a so-called 'fighting team,' openly threatening the poor and lower-middle peasants, saying: 'In the past, you poor and lower-middle peasants tormented us, and now you still want to torment us! We will also rebel!' These ironclad facts powerfully prove Chairman Mao's wise judgment.

It is worth pondering that, precisely when the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country are continuously deepening and developing, and the proletariat is about to thoroughly bury capitalism, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party desperately promotes the theory of the extinction of class struggle. In essence, it is to cover up the reality of class struggle, confuse the boundaries between enemies and us, dull the revolutionary people's vigilance, and create conditions for the restoration of capitalism. In some areas of Rongjiang, when the landlord and rich peasant elements attempted to restore capitalism, they also sang the tune of 'we all eat by labor points,' 'we are all one family.' These words are so similar to what the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party says. Isn't it clear that they are completely in cahoots, mutually supporting each other? It's just that one shouts from above, and the other stirs up trouble below.

A handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the original Rongjiang County Committee, under the instigation of their boss who promotes the theory of the extinction of class struggle, vigorously peddled revisionist goods. They talked only about production, not class struggle, only about mechanization, not the thought revolution of people, only about material incentives, not political command, only about grain, not about guns, and allowed capitalism to spread. They saw the proletarian dictatorship tool—the militia—as a thorn in their eye, collecting 'flaws' in the mass militia movement everywhere. They had completely degenerated into spokesmen for the bourgeoisie within the Party, with not a trace of a communist's spirit.

Never forget class struggle; this is the call from our great leader Chairman Mao. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great call, resolutely smash the theory of the extinction of class struggle created by the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, and smash his plot to restore capitalism. We will resolutely criticize, expose, and denounce this Chinese Khrushchev, thoroughly eliminate his poisonous influence, and let the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought shine brilliantly throughout China and the world.

    眼睛里时刻要有敌人
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、一等功臣　吴兴春
    阶级、阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的观点，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的精髓，是我们观察和分析一切事物的总开关。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在我国，虽然社会主义改造，在所有制方面说来，已经基本完成，革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争已经基本结束，但是，被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束”。“社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”因此，毛主席谆谆教导我们：千万不要忘记阶级斗争。可是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却蓄意大唱反调，恶毒攻击光焰无际的毛泽东思想，大力鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论。胡说什么“敌人消灭得差不多了”、
  “国内的主要阶级的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了。……敌我矛盾已经基本解决了。”他还大肆为剥削阶级涂脂抹粉，说什么“今天的资本家已是公私合营了的新式资本家了”、“在公私合营以后，资本家已把工厂交出来了，除开极少数的分子以外，他们已经不愿意反抗社会主义了”。总之一句话：阶级斗争熄灭了。
    敌人果真消灭得差不多了吗？阶级斗争果真熄灭了吗？不，这完全是别有用心的鬼话。我从一九五一年起就在贵州省从江县工作，十多年来的斗争实践，我把它总结为一句话，就是“眼睛里时刻要有敌人”。我深深地认识到，阶级斗争并没有熄灭，仍然是复杂的，尖锐的。阶级敌人时刻梦想复辟资本主义。从江县龙图公社宰门大队地主梁立前是个伪乡长。一九六二年他临死的时候，交给他的儿子一本保存了十多年的变天账，和他在土改时偷偷复制下来的两份田土契约，嘱咐他的儿子要为他报仇。他的儿子以后就勾结一些地主富农，专门搞破坏活动，成了现行反革命分子。阶级敌人的这种反动本性就是这样，他们是至死也不会改变的。
    十多年来，从江地区的阶级敌人向无产阶级发起的猖狂进攻此起彼伏，什么花招，什么手段都使过。如我们稍微有所松懈，就会被敌人钻空子，上敌人的当。从江县贯洞公社贯洞大队有一个地主，趁着我国遭受三年自然灾害的时候，纠集一伙牛鬼蛇神，在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，在当地刮起了一股妖风。他们破坏集体生产，宰杀生产队的耕牛，闹包产到户。一时间弄得乌烟瘴气，甚至雇工剥削、放高利贷的现象也出现了。这个大队有十一个生产队，其中有十个队的集体生产遭到破坏。广大贫下中农识破了阶级敌人的阴谋，团结起来顶住这股妖风，可是，原从江县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派却对阶级敌人的破坏大加赞扬，还专门总结了包产到户的“优越性”，到处推广。我们县武装部遵照上级的指示，组织了一个工作组，到贯洞去纠正这股单干风。正当我们依靠广大的贫下中农和民兵，充分发动群众击退阶级敌人的进攻的时候，从江县委内一个走资本主义道路的当权派便气势汹汹地跑来阻止我们，还吓唬我们说：“你们要纠正单干，群众就会跑光了！”我们和他进行了坚决的斗争，当场把他顶了回去。以后，广大群众发动起来，斗争了带头闹事的地主，粉碎了敌人妄图复辟资本主义的阴谋，恢复了集体生产，群众不仅没有跑，反而更加坚定了走社会主义道路的决心，生产搞得热气腾腾。
    在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，阶级敌人又蠢蠢欲动。有个地方，混进我们队伍中的地主、富农分子，也组织了一个什么“战斗队”，公开威胁贫下中农说：“过去你们贫下中农把我们整苦了，现在还想整我们呀！我们也要起来造反哪！”这些铁的事实，有力地证明了毛主席的英明论断。
    值得深思的是，正是在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设不断深入发展，无产阶级要彻底埋葬资本主义的时候，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派拚命鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，是有他的政治目的的，说穿了就是为了掩盖阶级斗争的实质，混淆敌我界限，麻痹革命人民的警惕性，为复辟资本主义创造条件。从江一些地区的地主、富农分子，在他们妄图进行复辟资本主义的时候，不也在高唱“我们都是靠劳动工分吃饭了”、“我们都是一家人了”的论调吗？这些话和党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所说的是多么相似。这不是很清楚地看出他们完全是一个鼻孔出气、互相呼应的吗？只不过一个在上面喊，一个在下面闹罢了。
    原从江县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在他们的后台老板鼓吹的阶级斗争熄灭论的怂恿下，大力贩卖修正主义的私货。他们口口声声地只讲生产，不讲阶级斗争，只讲机械化，不讲人的思想革命化，光搞物质刺激，不要政治挂帅，只要粮，不要枪，听任资本主义泛滥。他们把无产阶级专政的工具——民兵，看成是眼中钉，到处去搜集“大办民兵”的“缺点”，他们完全堕落成了资产阶级在党内的代言人，那里还有一丝一毫的共产党员的气味。
    千万不要忘记阶级斗争，这是伟大领袖毛主席向我们发出的号召。我们一定要牢记毛主席的这个伟大的号召，坚决粉碎党内头号走资本主义道路当权派制造的阶级斗争熄灭论，粉碎他复辟资本主义的阴谋。我们坚决把这个中国的赫鲁晓夫批倒、批透、批臭，坚决肃清他的一切流毒，让战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想在全中国、全世界放射出灿烂的光辉。　　（新华社）
