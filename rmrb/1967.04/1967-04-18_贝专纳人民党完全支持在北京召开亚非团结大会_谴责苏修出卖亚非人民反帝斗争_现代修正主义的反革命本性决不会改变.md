Botswana People's Party Fully Supports the Holding of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference in Beijing
Condemns Soviet Revisionists' Betrayal of the Anti-Imperialist Struggle of the Asian-African Peoples
The Reactionary Nature of Modern Revisionism Will Never Change

	According to a report from Cairo on the 15th by Xinhua News Agency, Bobbie Marks, a member of the National Executive Committee of the Botswana People's Party, issued a statement here on the 15th, announcing full support for the Chinese Preparatory Committee of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference to proceed with preparations for the Fifth Conference to be held in Beijing this year in accordance with the resolutions of the Winnipeg Conference.

	The statement said that the Botswana People's Party "will do everything possible to ensure the success of the Fifth Conference, achieving a significant victory for the anti-imperialist revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa."

	The statement emphasized: "Our Fifth Conference, led by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao Zedong, will certainly achieve great success. All demons blocking the way will be swept into the abyss, and the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa will establish a new organization free from Soviet revisionist corruption."

	The statement condemned the Soviet revisionists for forcibly holding an illegal Eighth Session of the Asian-African Solidarity Council in Nicosia in February, splitting the Asian-African solidarity movement, and sabotaging the struggle of the Asian-African peoples against imperialism and old and new colonialism.

	The statement stressed: Modern revisionism, like a malignant tumor, will never change its nature. It will never stop betraying the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of various countries, and it will never cease colluding with U.S. imperialism until its doom.

	The statement said: "As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: 'All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no great power.' The Soviet revisionists and their lackeys' farce at the so-called 'Third Asian-African Writers' Conference' in Beirut and their charade in Nicosia can only be described as lifting a rock only to drop it on their own feet, deepening their isolation and hastening their demise."

	The statement said that all revolutionary Asian-African solidarity organizations and revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa strongly oppose the Soviet revisionists' illegal resolution to change the venue of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference from Beijing to Algiers. The statement went on to emphasize: "No matter what difficulties the enemy creates for us, our party and people are determined to resist them, to advance forever, and never to retreat. Whatever the enemy supports, we oppose; whatever the enemy opposes, we support."

    贝专纳人民党完全支持在北京召开亚非团结大会
    谴责苏修出卖亚非人民反帝斗争
    现代修正主义的反革命本性决不会改变
    据新华社开罗十五日电　贝专纳人民党全国执行委员会委员波比·马克十五日在这里发表声明，宣布完全支持第五届亚非人民团结大会中国筹备委员会按照温尼巴大会决议，就今年在北京召开的第五届大会进行筹备工作。
    声明说，贝专纳人民党“将全力使第五届大会获得巨大成功，使反帝的亚非革命人民获得显著的胜利”。
    声明强调指出：“我们的第五届大会有毛泽东主席亲自发动的中国无产阶级文化大革命为先导，必将取得巨大成功，一切挡道的魔鬼都将被扫进深渊，革命的亚非人民将成立不受苏修腐蚀的新组织。”
    声明谴责苏联修正主义者今年二月在尼科西亚强行举行非法的第八届亚非团结理事会会议，分裂亚非人民团结运动，破坏亚非人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争。
    声明强调指出：现代修正主义就象毒瘤一样，它的本性绝不会改变，它绝不会放弃对各国人民反帝斗争的出卖，绝不会停止同美帝国主义勾结，直到它的灭亡。
    声明说：“正如毛泽东主席所指出的：‘一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。’苏联修正主义者及其走狗在贝鲁特召开的伪‘第三届亚非作家大会’和在尼科西亚导演的丑剧，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，加深他们的孤立和加快他们的灭亡。”
    声明说，一切革命的亚非团结组织和亚非革命人民，都强烈反对苏修强行把举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的地点从北京改到阿尔及尔的非法决议。声明接着强调指出：“不管敌人给我们制造什么样的困难，我们党和人民决心同他们对抗，永远前进，决不后退。凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对；凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护。”
