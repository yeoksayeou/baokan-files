How should the proletarian revolutionary faction grasp the revolution and promote production after taking power? The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Lhoka Woolen Mill in Tibet resolutely implements Chairman Mao's revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy, forming a revolutionary committee; breaks through the past constraints on the development of productive forces, establishing a new revolutionary order; through painstaking ideological work, unites the majority of cadres; widely and deeply studies and applies Chairman Mao's works, accelerates ideological revolution, and unleashes the initiative and creativity of the masses, achieving double victories in revolution and production.

Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." The good news of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" from the Lhoka Woolen Mill on the Tibetan Plateau once again eloquently proves this truth.

The good news of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" from the Lhoka Woolen Mill also strongly refutes the revisionist fallacy advocated by the number one capitalist-roaders within the Party, which claims that "if the distribution is relatively fair and reasonable and everyone is satisfied, it will promote the development of productive forces."

The "Sixteen Points" point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." In the past, in some units and regions, the initiative of the masses in production was suppressed by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party using various means. When the proletarian revolutionary faction rises up in revolution, this handful of people, using the power still temporarily in their hands, use various tricks to sabotage production. The example of the Lhoka Woolen Mill proves: the proletarian revolutionary faction must seize power into their own hands, establish a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ, remove the lid suppressing the development of production, and cut off the black hands sabotaging production, in order to open up a vast horizon for the full play of the initiative and creativity of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres.

The great development of production is inseparable from the ideological revolution of the people. To achieve the ideological revolution of the people, we must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to smash the spiritual shackles of counter-revolutionary revisionism advocated by the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, and take the selfless new ideas of the proletariat as the driving force for progress.

People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest productive force.

According to a report from our newspaper, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Lhoka Woolen Mill in Tibet, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the most resolute attitude, unconditionally implements Chairman Mao's revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy, fully utilizes the authority of the proletariat, uses the revolution to lead production, and has achieved great successes in both revolution and production.

During the Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Lhoka Woolen Mill manipulated rightist organizations, gathered counter-revolutionaries and bad elements, and brutally suppressed revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres; they incited workers to demand higher wages and benefits, instigated workers' families from their hometowns to send a large number of telegrams, inciting workers to leave the factory, and spread a counter-revolutionary wind of economic opportunism; they also organized the "Long March Accusation Team," leaving their production posts and staying in Lhasa for a long time. The various sabotage activities of the class enemies once caused the entire factory's production to plummet sharply.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory stood up and engaged in a fierce struggle with a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. With the strong support of the local garrison troops, they achieved a great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary faction, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy, and finally seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party on February 18.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power, they fully played the role of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production," broke through the various constraints on the development of productive forces, established a new revolutionary production order, and production increased significantly. In the first quarter, the plan for woolen fabric production was 20,216 meters, but 20,362 meters were completed; the plan for blanket production was 1,364, but 1,373 were completed. The first quarter's production plan for the entire factory was completed two days ahead of schedule, making up for the production shortfall in January and February. Product quality has also improved, and a new type of patterned blanket has been successfully trial-produced.

Why has the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Lhoka Woolen Mill achieved such outstanding results in grasping the revolution and promoting production?

They resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy. During the power seizure, representatives from revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary leading cadres, and military representatives formed the revolutionary committee (temporary power organ). This revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leading cadre represents the will of the entire factory's revolutionary workers and cadres, truly becoming the authority of the proletariat. The representatives of the revolutionary mass organizations are revolutionary pioneers and production models; they are the most closely connected with the broad masses of workers and can best reflect the voices of the workers. Their participation in the revolutionary committee can best unite the majority and fully mobilize the initiative of the masses, becoming the foundation for seizing and holding power. The participation of revolutionary cadres in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ played a backbone role in seizing and holding power. The vast majority of cadres in the entire factory continue to work. This is one of the important reasons for achieving double victories in revolution and production. The participation of military representatives greatly supported the revolutionary faction, suppressed the reactionary momentum of the rightists, and played a major role in helping the masses and cadres to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, implement the Party's policies and guidelines, and grasp the direction of the struggle.

After the revolutionary faction seized power, they broke through the various constraints on the development of productive forces imposed by the bourgeoisie in the past, establishing a revolutionary production order. The revolutionary committee established a brand-new production management mechanism, and each workshop set up a leading group for grasping the revolution and promoting production. The members participating in the leading cadre are both organizers of the revolution and promoting production and ordinary laborers; they discover and solve problems together with the broad masses in labor, completely changing the past bureaucratic style of bourgeois officials sitting in offices, listening to reports, demanding figures, and pointing fingers, solving the problem of idle personnel in business institutions.

The revolutionary faction, through painstaking political and ideological work, united more than 90% of the masses. They exposed, denounced, and criticized the crimes of the capitalist-roaders, educating and winning over the masses who had been deceived. For those masses who were deeply deceived and whose thoughts had not yet turned around, they patiently presented facts, explained reasons, and actively and enthusiastically helped them, finally winning over the majority. While focusing on political and ideological education, the revolutionary committee played the role of proletarian revolutionary authority, strengthening labor discipline. Most of the workers who had been clamoring to return to Shanghai no longer made a fuss, and the attendance rate reached more than 90%. They also changed the two-shift system to a three-shift system, insisting on eight hours of labor, and using leisure time for revolution. All of these effectively promoted the development of production.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power, they organized workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, widely and deeply propagandizing Mao Zedong Thought, breaking the bourgeois "self" and establishing the proletarian "public." After the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power, they immediately took the method of fighting while rectifying to address certain unhealthy tendencies within their own ranks, studying the brilliant works such as "Old Three Articles" and "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas Within the Party," overcoming arrogance, complacency, individualism, localism, and the desire for fame. The rectification and study of the revolutionary faction promoted the entire factory's revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, seizing the "self" in their minds, and strengthening ideological revolution. The facts show that only when the proletarian revolutionary faction holds power can Mao Zedong Thought quickly occupy all positions. The great Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the revolutionary masses, produces tremendous material force.

    无产阶级革命派掌权后怎样抓革命促生产？
    充分运用无产阶级权威　用革命统帅生产
    西藏林芝毛纺厂无产阶级革命派，坚决执行毛主席革命的“三结合”方针，组成革命委员会；打破过去束缚生产力发展的条条框框，建立革命新秩序；通过艰苦细致的思想工作，团结大部分干部；广泛深入地活学活用毛主席著作，加速思想革命化，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，夺得革命生产双胜利。
    编者按：毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”西藏高原上传来的林芝毛纺厂“抓革命，促生产”的喜讯，又一次雄辩地证实了这个真理。
    林芝毛纺厂“抓革命，促生产”的喜讯，还强有力地驳斥了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的“分配得比较公平合理，大家满意，就促进生产力的发展”的修正主义谬论。
    “十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”过去，在一些单位，一些地区，群众的生产积极性被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派用种种手段压抑着。当无产阶级革命派起来革命的时候，这一小撮人运用暂时仍然掌握在他们手中的权，用种种诡计破坏生产。林芝毛纺厂的事例证明：无产阶级革命派只有把权夺到自己手里，建立革命的“三结合”临时权力机构，掀掉压抑发展生产的盖子，斩断破坏生产的黑手，才能为广大革命群众和革命干部的积极性、创造性的充分发挥，开辟广阔的天地。
    生产的大发展，同人的思想革命化是分不开的。要实现人的思想革命化，就要以毛泽东思想为武器，打碎党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所宣扬的反革命修正主义的精神枷锁，以无产阶级的大公无私的新思想作为前进的动力。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众，是最伟大的生产力。
    本报讯　西藏林芝毛纺厂的无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以最坚决的态度，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的革命的“三结合”方针，充分运用无产阶级权威，以革命统帅生产，取得了革命和生产的巨大成就。
    在文化大革命中，林芝毛纺厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，操纵右派组织，纠集反、坏分子，疯狂镇压革命群众和革命干部；煽动工人闹工资福利，唆使工人原籍的家属发来大量电报，煽动工人离厂，大刮反革命经济主义妖风；还组织“长征控告团”，脱离生产岗位，到拉萨长期逗留。阶级敌人的种种破坏活动，一度使全厂生产急剧下降。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派站起来了，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了激烈斗争。他们在当地驻军的大力支持下，实现了无产阶级革命派大联合，坚决执行了毛主席的革命的“三结合”方针，终于在二月十八日从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺了权。
    无产阶级革命派夺权后，充分发挥了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构的作用，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，打破束缚生产力发展的条条框框，建立了革命的生产新秩序，生产大幅度增长。第一季度，呢绒计划生产二○二一六米，完成二○三六二米；毛毯计划生产一三六四条，完成一三七三条。第一季度全厂生产计划，提前两天完成，补上了一、二月份亏下的产量。产品质量也有所提高，并试制成功一种提花毛毯新产品。
    林芝毛纺厂无产阶级革命派为什么能在抓革命促生产方面做出这样出色的成绩呢？
    坚决贯彻执行了毛主席的革命的“三结合”方针。在夺权中，由革命群众组织代表、革命领导干部和军队代表，组成了革命委员会（临时权力机构）。这种革命的“三结合”的领导班子，代表了全厂广大革命职工、革命干部的意志，真正成为无产阶级的权威。革命群众组织的代表是革命的闯将，生产的模范，他们同广大工人群众联系最密切，最能反映工人群众的呼声，他们参加革命委员会，最能团结大多数，充分调动群众的积极性，成为夺权和掌权的基础。革命干部参加了“三结合”的临时权力机构，对夺权和掌权起了骨干作用。全厂干部中的绝大多数人都在继续工作。这是能够取得革命、生产双胜利的重要原因之一。军队代表的参加，大大支持了革命派，打击了右派的反动气焰，在帮助群众和干部活学活用毛主席著作、执行党的方针政策、掌握斗争大方向上，都起了重大作用。
    革命派夺权以后，打破了过去资产阶级那一套束缚生产力发展的条条框框，建立了革命的生产秩序。革命委员会建立了崭新的生产管理机构，各车间成立了抓革命促生产领导小组。参加领导班子的成员，既是抓革命促生产的组织者，又是普通劳动者，他们同广大群众一起，在劳动中发现问题，解决问题，完全改变了过去那些领导人员坐办公室听汇报、要数字、指手划脚的资产阶级官僚主义作风，解决了业务机构人浮于事的问题。
    革命派通过艰苦细致的政治思想工作，把百分之九十以上的群众团结起来了。他们通过揭发、控诉、批判走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，教育和争取了曾经受到蒙蔽的群众。对于那些受蒙蔽较深、一时思想转不过来的群众，也耐心地摆事实，讲道理，主动热情地帮助他们，终于争取团结了大多数。在抓政治思想教育的同时，革命委员会发挥了无产阶级革命权威的作用，加强劳动纪律。原来闹着要回上海的工人，大多数不再闹了，出勤率达到百分之九十以上。他们还把两班制改为三班制，坚持八小时劳动，工余时间闹革命。这些都有效地促进了生产的发展。
    无产阶级革命派夺权以后，组织职工活学活用毛主席著作，广泛深入地宣传毛泽东思想，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字。无产阶级革命派夺权以后，针对自己队伍中的某些不良倾向，立即采取边战斗、边整风的方法，学习“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，克服骄傲自满情绪、松劲情绪，克服个人主义、本位主义、风头主义。革命派的整风学习，推动了全厂广大革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，大夺自己头脑里“私”字的权，加强了思想革命化。事实说明，只有无产阶级革命派掌了大权，毛泽东思想才能迅速占领一切阵地。伟大的毛泽东思想为革命群众所掌握，就产生出巨大的物质力量。
