Some revolutionary cadres in Shanxi Province shared their personal experiences: We must firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and unite with the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations in thought to jointly hold power, use power, and shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: Some revolutionary cadres in Shanxi Province recently shared with our reporters their experiences of learning from the broad revolutionary masses and the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations. They said that the broad revolutionary masses are the foundation of the "three-in-one combination" provisional power organs; in the "three-in-one combination" provisional power organs, the role of revolutionary mass organization leaders who truly represent the broad revolutionary masses must be fully played. These revolutionary cadres expressed that they would humbly learn from the strengths of the broad revolutionary masses and the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, truly unite with them in thought, jointly hold power, use power, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, do a good job in socialist construction, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Firmly Believe in and Rely on the Masses

Chen Shouchang, a member of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and head of the Taiyuan Municipal Revolutionary Committee (originally the secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee), said: The broad revolutionary masses are the foundation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who genuinely support the revolution." Without the great alliance of the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, it is impossible to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ. The attitude towards the revolutionary mass organization leaders who truly represent the broad masses in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is an important indicator of whether one can implement the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

He said, the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations are revolutionary pioneers who have emerged from under the rule of a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Their revolutionary direction is always correct. They fight most resolutely and bravely against the capitalist-roaders within the Party. They are outstanding elements among the revolutionary masses. We should learn from them, firmly trust them, support them, and let them work boldly. Through practice, they will be tempered and improved, and cultivated as successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. Any idea or action that belittles the role of the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations is a negation of the revolutionary masses, a negation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and an anti-Mao Zedong Thought stance. We must firmly believe in and rely on the masses, and honestly be students of the masses.

Chen Shouchang said, in the Taiyuan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations are shouldering the burdens of revolution and production, and their work is excellent. He continued, in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses, especially the revolutionary youngsters, have shown great daring in thinking, doing, and revolution, greatly educating the revolutionary cadres. Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses often engage in mutual criticism and self-criticism, help each other, and have established revolutionary comradeship. We are happy to see that millions of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution are growing up in this great storm of class struggle. This is the political and organizational guarantee for our Party and country to remain unchanged.

Learn from the Leaders of Revolutionary Mass Organizations and Absorb Their Strengths

Long Qingyun, head of the Pingxian County Revolutionary Committee (originally the deputy county magistrate of Pingxian County), said, revolutionary cadres must first believe in and rely on the masses in thought to rely on the revolutionary masses in action and establish a clear mass perspective. In the past, the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the county committee did evil deeds that I could not tolerate, so they hated me, suppressed me, and attacked me. However, I was fighting alone and had not united with the masses, so my struggle was powerless. Later, I gained the support of the broad revolutionary masses and achieved a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" with them. Due to the power of the broad revolutionary masses, our struggle has taken on a new situation. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has fully demonstrated the power of the masses, touched my soul, and initially solved the problem of believing in the masses in my thoughts.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The youth are the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force. They are the most eager to learn, the least conservative, especially in the socialist era." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of previously unknown revolutionary young people have become brave pioneers. In the struggle for power, they have made great achievements. The general direction of these revolutionary pioneers is correct, and they have many strengths that we should humbly learn from. For their shortcomings and mistakes, we should actively and wholeheartedly help them.

He said, from the previous practice of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," I felt that this new form most reflects the voice of the masses and closely connects the Party with the masses. As revolutionary cadres, we should learn from the revolutionary masses and the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, and absorb the nutrients from the revolutionary masses. The people have the greatest creativity and wisdom. I firmly believe that we should be willing to be small students of the masses. Only in this way can we obtain the qualification certificate to be teachers later.

Overthrow the "Self" and Unite with the Revolutionary Masses in Thought

Li Zhiyong, head of the Jixian County Revolutionary Committee and commander of the Jixian County Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters (originally the deputy secretary of the Jixian County Party Committee), said: I stood up to revolt at a crucial moment when the revolutionary masses united and seized power from a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and with the support, encouragement, and help of the revolutionary mass organizations and the People's Liberation Army. I deeply feel that the broad revolutionary masses are the foundation for the revolutionary masses to seize power from a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and are the foundation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ.

I think: whether a leading cadre can truly rely on the revolutionary masses in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is not a matter of method, but a matter of worldview. After our county achieved the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," I was initially cautious, seeking the opinions of the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations on big and small matters. At that time, I thought I had just stood up, fearing that if I handled things wrong, I would make mistakes again. In essence, it was the "self" at work. With this problem, I studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the brilliant work "Opposing Liberalism." Chairman Mao said: "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, active, and regard revolutionary interests as the first priority, and subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests." Chairman Mao's words hit the nail on the head. I decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, overthrow the "self," prioritize revolutionary interests, and dare to work.

Later, I worked more boldly. But another problem arose: I was unwilling to assign some work to the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations. I mistakenly thought that they were young and lacked experience, fearing that they could not complete the tasks. The essence of this thought is to belittle the role of revolutionary mass organizations, lack a mass perspective, and only believe in oneself and not in the masses. With this problem, I studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings. Chairman Mao said: "The masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and laughable. Not understanding this, one cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, through continuous struggle, I overcame the idea of not believing in the masses, and my unity with the revolutionary mass organizations progressed from a formal unity to a unity in thought.

Once the thought problem was solved, other problems were also resolved. In daily work, I often live, study, work, and fight with the comrades from revolutionary mass organizations. We discuss matters together, listen to their opinions humbly, and fully play their roles. In the process of learning from them, I always enthusiastically and patiently point out their shortcomings and mistakes to help them correct them. In this way, our relationship became closer, and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" was greatly strengthened.

From the previous practice, I deeply felt that the revolutionary masses are the foundation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and the foundation for holding and using power properly. The leaders of revolutionary mass organizations can fully reflect the true demands of the broad masses and timely implement the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Fully playing their role can ensure that the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ and the broad revolutionary masses are closely connected, allowing us to always hear the voices of the masses and receive their supervision.

Rely on Revolutionary Masses in the Struggle for Power and Even More in the Struggle for Holding Power

Gao Wenhuan, a member of the Jingxian County Revolutionary Committee and commander of the Jingxian County Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters (originally the county magistrate of Jingxian County), said: In the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ, I fought and worked with five representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, who were previously "unknown youngsters." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and firmly joined the battle. In the fierce struggle for power, they were the brave warriors charging against the small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; after seizing power, they were the vanguards of carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation and promoting revolution and production. Their class consciousness is high, their class standpoint is clear, they are closely connected with the masses, and they have great wisdom and courage. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution unfolded throughout the county, in some areas, a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party colluded with local landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production. The young revolutionaries promptly discovered this problem and proposed specific measures to the headquarters, effectively striking back against the counterattack of the class enemies.

Practice has proven that the broad proletarian revolutionary masses are the main force in the struggle for power against a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the foundation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." In the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," their role must be fully played, and their opinions must be fully valued, and they must not be treated as mere decorations. We must rely on them in the struggle for power and even more so in the struggle for holding power. We revolutionary cadres must humbly learn from them, firmly stand with the broad revolutionary masses, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    必须充分发挥革命群众组织负责人在“三结合”中的作用
    山西省一些革命领导干部畅谈自己的切身体会：一定要坚定不移地相信群众，依靠群众，同革命群众组织的负责人从思想上结合起来，共同掌好权，用好权，挑起革命和生产两副重担。
    新华社太原电　山西省一些革命的领导干部最近向本社记者谈到了他们向广大革命群众和革命群众组织负责人学习的体会。他们说，广大革命群众是革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的基础；在“三结合”的临时权力机构中，必须充分发挥真正代表广大革命群众的革命群众组织负责人的作用。这些革命的领导干部表示，要虚心学习广大革命群众和革命群众组织负责人的长处，同他们真正从思想上结合起来，共同掌好权，用好权，挑起革命和生产两副重担，搞好社会主义建设，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    坚定不移地相信群众、依靠群众
    中共山西省核心小组成员、中共太原市核心小组组长（原太原市委书记处书记）陈守中说：广大的革命群众，是革命的“三结合”的基础。毛主席教导我们：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”没有用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众的大联合，就不可能建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的“三结合”临时权力机构。对待革命的“三结合”中真正代表广大群众的革命群众组织负责人的态度问题，是能不能执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志。
    他说，革命群众组织的负责人，是从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的统治下“杀”出来的革命闯将，他们的革命大方向始终是正确的，他们同走资本主义道路的当权派斗争最坚决、最勇敢，他们是革命群众中的优秀分子。我们应该向他们学习，坚决地信任他们，支持他们，放手让他们大胆工作，在实践中得到锻炼和提高，培养他们做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。任何贬低革命群众组织负责人的作用的想法和作法，就是否定革命群众，否定无产阶级文化大革命，是反毛泽东思想的。我们必须坚定不移地信任群众，依靠群众，老老实实地当群众的学生。
    陈守中说，在太原市革命委员会中，革命群众组织的负责人挑着革命和生产的重担，工作做得很好。他接着说，在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，革命群众，特别是革命小将敢想、敢干、敢革命的大无畏精神，大大教育了革命的领导干部。革命领导干部和革命群众平时互相展开批评和自我批评，互相帮助，建立了革命的战斗友谊。我们高兴地看到，千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人，正在这场阶级斗争的大风大浪中成长起来，这是使我们的党和国家永远不改变颜色的政治保证和组织保证。
    向革命群众组织负责人学习，从他们身上吸取营养
    中共平顺县核心小组组长（原平顺县副县长）龙庆云说，革命领导干部要在行动上依靠革命群众，首先必须从思想上相信群众、依靠群众，树立明确的群众观点。过去县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派干的罪恶勾当，我看不惯，他们就恨我、压我、打击我。可是，我是孤军作战，没有与群众结合，因此斗争很无力。后来，我得到了广大革命群众的支持，同他们实现了革命的“三结合”。由于广大革命群众的威力，我们的斗争出现了一个崭新的局面。这场无产阶级文化大革命，充分显示了群众的威力，触及了我的灵魂，使我从思想上初步解决了相信群众的问题。
    毛主席教导我们说：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。他们最肯学习，最少保守思想，在社会主义时代尤其是这样。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，一大批本来不出名的革命青少年成了勇敢的闯将。在夺权斗争中，他们作出了丰功伟绩。这些革命闯将的大方向是正确的，他们有许多长处，我们应该虚心向他们学习。对于他们的缺点、错误，我们应该积极地、满腔热情地帮助他们。
    他说，从前一段革命的“三结合”实践中，我体会到，革命的“三结合”这一新形式，最能反映群众的呼声，密切党和群众的联系。作为革命领导干部，应该向革命群众学习，向革命群众组织的负责人学习，从革命群众身上吸取营养。人民群众有最大的创造力，有最大的智慧。我毫不含糊地认为，应该甘心当群众的小学生。只有这样，才能取得后当先生的合格证。
    打倒“私”字，与革命群众从思想上结合
    中共吉县核心小组组长、吉县革命造反总指挥部主任（原吉县县委副书记）李志勇说：我是在无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的关键时刻，在毛泽东思想的指引下，在革命群众组织和人民解放军的支持、鼓励和帮助下，站出来革命的干部。我深深体会到：广大革命群众，是无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的基础，是革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的基础。
    我认为：领导干部在革命的“三结合”中，是否能真正依靠革命群众，决不是个方法问题，而是个世界观问题。我们县实现革命的“三结合”以后，开始时我有些谨小慎微，大小事情都要征求革命群众组织负责人的意见。那时，我认为自己刚站出来，怕事情处理错了又犯错误。说穿了，就是“私”字在作怪。带上这个问题，我学习了毛主席的“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》等光辉著作。毛主席说：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。毛主席的话一下子说到我的病根子上，我决心遵照毛主席的教导，打倒“私”字，以革命利益为重，大胆干工作。
    以后，我工作大胆了。但又出了另外一个方面的问题，这就是有些工作不愿意分配给革命群众组织的负责人去搞。我错误地认为，他们年轻，工作缺少经验，怕他们完不成任务。这种思想的实质，是贬低革命群众组织的作用，缺乏群众观点，只相信自己不相信群众。带着这个问题，我学习了毛主席的有关教导。毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”遵照毛主席的教导，经过不断的斗争，克服了不相信群众的观点，我和革命群众组织的结合由形式的结合进入了思想的结合。
    思想问题解决了，其他问题也就迎刃而解了。在日常工作中，我经常和革命群众组织的同志们生活在一起，学习在一起，工作在一起，战斗在一起，有事共同商量，虚心地听取他们的意见，充分发挥他们的作用。我在向他们学习的过程中，对于他们的缺点和错误，也总是满怀热情地、耐心地给他们提出，帮助他们改正。这样，我们的关系更密切了，从而也大大加强了革命的“三结合”。
    从前一段的实践中，我深深体会到，革命群众是革命的“三结合”的基础，是掌好权、用好权的基础。革命群众组织的负责人，能够充分反映广大群众的真正要求，能够及时贯彻执行毛主席和党中央的指示。充分发挥他们的作用，就能上情下达，下情上传，密切革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构与广大革命群众的关系，使我们能经常听到群众的声音，受到群众的监督。
    在夺权斗争中要依靠革命群众，在掌权斗争中更要依靠革命群众
    中共静乐县核心小组成员、静乐县革命造反总指挥部总指挥（原静乐县县长）高文焕说：在革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构中，我和革命群众组织的代表、五名过去的“无名小将”一起斗争，一起工作。他们在无产阶级文化大革命中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，无限坚定地投入了战斗。在激烈的夺权斗争中，他们是向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派冲锋陷阵的勇士；在掌权以后，他们又是进行斗、批、改和抓革命、促生产的先锋。他们的阶级觉悟高，阶级观点鲜明，联系群众密切，有大智大勇。当无产阶级文化大革命在全县范围内展开后，在一些地区，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派勾结社会上的地、富、反、坏、右分子，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏生产。革命小将们及时发现了这个问题，并且及时地向总指挥部提出了具体措施，有力地打击了阶级敌人的反扑。
    实践证明，广大无产阶级革命派是向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权斗争的主力军，是革命的“三结合”的基础。在革命的“三结合”中，必须充分发挥他们的作用，必须充分重视他们的意见，而绝不能把他们当作陪衬。在夺权斗争中要依靠他们，在掌权斗争中更要依靠他们。我们革命领导干部，必须向他们虚心学习，坚定不移地和广大革命群众站在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
