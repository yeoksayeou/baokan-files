The frontline command headquarters of Pinggu County in Beijing has firmly implemented Chairman Mao's directive that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." In the spring ploughing season, it has emphasized proletarian politics, used Mao Zedong Thought to guide spring ploughing, and achieved remarkable results.

Since its establishment more than a month ago, the county has seen a new high tide in spring ploughing. The command headquarters has had to address an increasing number of production and operational issues, making its work increasingly busy. In this situation, should it follow the old path of "production first," material incentives, and target setting promoted by the former Beijing Municipal Committee? Or should it break away from old leadership methods, emphasize Mao Zedong Thought, and prioritize politics over production? This question was sharply posed to the command headquarters.

The leaders of the command headquarters believed that this was a serious political struggle. Unless the old line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, which promoted revisionism, was thoroughly smashed, Mao Zedong's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production" could not be genuinely implemented. They resolutely resisted various old habits and forces of interference, placing revolution at the forefront. They said: No matter how chaotic the situation, no matter how many problems there are, the first thing to do is to study Chairman Mao's works and promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. Otherwise, one would lose the political direction. While organizing staff to study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, discussing the relationship between politics and operations, and criticizing the influence of revisionism, they also learned from the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army and adopted a series of revolutionary measures.

The command headquarters first adopted a unified command structure for political and production work, with politics guiding production and leading production. In the past, the old county committee's departments responsible for political and ideological work rarely coordinated with production departments. When production was busy, political work was often neglected, and political workers became mere "production cadres." Now, while establishing and strengthening the county, commune, and brigade-level production teams, the command headquarters has also established and strengthened political work institutions as an integral part of the various levels of command. Under unified leadership and arrangements, political work on the frontline of production throughout the county has been very active. Along with the launch of the spring ploughing production campaign, a new wave of studying Chairman Mao's works has emerged. Each production team insists on studying Chairman Mao's quotations in the fields during the day and organizes commune members to study Chairman Mao's works a few nights a week. Various levels of political work departments have recently strengthened their work with cadres, organizing cadres and commune members to study Chairman Mao's policies on cadres and related editorials in the "Red Flag" magazine, helping cadres stand tall and do their work well. Many communes and brigades have held political work meetings, study and application meetings of Chairman Mao's works, set up models, and exchanged experiences, enabling the broad masses of commune members and cadres to participate in spring ploughing production with high political enthusiasm.

When the command headquarters arranges, inspects, and summarizes work, it first arranges, inspects, and summarizes the situation of studying Chairman Mao's works. Since its establishment more than a month ago, every time the command headquarters holds a meeting or arranges a task, it adheres to this principle, especially emphasizing the repeated propaganda of Chairman Mao's strategic line of "grasp revolution, promote production," and the relevant policies and directives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, using Mao Zedong Thought to unify understanding and resolve contradictions. Recently, the county command headquarters held a production report meeting attended by commune-level leaders. Unlike the past, where meetings were held to report numbers, set targets, and demand supplies, this meeting first reported on the situation and problems of studying Chairman Mao's works in various communes, reflecting many good deeds and the active thoughts of cadres and the masses, turning this production meeting into a political work meeting.

The county command headquarters also organized a large number of cadres from various departments who were sent to the countryside into a political work team. In the past, under the slogan of "bring targets to the countryside and bring production back" proposed by the old county committee to resist political leadership, many cadres sent to the countryside often rushed about to urge production progress and compile statistics. Now, they first take the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as their primary task and take investigation and research, class analysis as the basic skills of cadres sent to the countryside. These cadres, upon arriving in the countryside, live, eat, work, and study Chairman Mao's works with the commune members, conduct investigations and research, support the revolutionary faction, unite revolutionary cadres, and ensure spring ploughing production. After a period of practice, the cadres sent to the countryside deeply felt that in the past, only focusing on production without asking about politics was truly difficult to move forward; now, by grasping revolution and promoting production, everything goes smoothly.

To adapt to the new situation of emphasizing politics throughout the county, the county command headquarters has correspondingly established a revolutionary work style. In the past, during the spring ploughing season, the county's production leadership departments were busy handling the supply and distribution of agricultural production materials. This year, the command headquarters first organized relevant departments to conduct investigations and strictly followed the principle of self-reliance, reasonably allocating materials and funds according to the actual needs of the communes and brigades, and resolutely not engaging in material incentives, greatly reducing the command headquarters' trivial administrative work. In the past, the county's production leadership departments were often busy with statistical figures. After the establishment of the command headquarters, it resolutely did not engage in "target setting" and did not evaluate the quality of work based on the number of figures, thus freeing many cadres from trivial statistical work. Now, four-fifths of the staff of this county's command headquarters have gone deep into the frontline of production to timely understand the situation, grasp the thoughts of commune members and cadres, understand the demands of the masses, and study production problems, enabling the command headquarters to issue timely and powerful directives for production based on the actual situation and agricultural seasons.

    突出无产阶级政治　抓好春耕生产
    平谷县第一线指挥部把革命放在首位，大抓活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化，有力地推动春耕生产
    据新华社十一日讯  北京市平谷县抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的指示，在春耕生产中突出无产阶级政治，以毛泽东思想统帅春耕生产，取得了显著成绩。
    指挥部成立以后的一个多月里，全县春耕生产出现了新高潮，需要指挥部解决的生产业务问题也越来越多，工作越来越繁忙。在这种情况下，是因循旧北京市委推行的“生产第一”、物质刺激、指标挂帅的老路？还是打破旧的领导方法，突出毛泽东思想，以政治统帅生产？这个问题尖锐地摆在指挥部面前。
    指挥部的领导人员认为，这是一场严肃的政治斗争，不彻底粉碎旧北京市委推行的一套修正主义货色，就不能真正贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。他们坚决顶住各种旧习惯势力的干扰，把革命放在首位。他们说：头绪再乱，问题再多，首先要抓好毛主席著作的学习，抓好人的思想革命化，不抓住这一环就要迷失政治方向。他们一面组织工作人员学习毛主席有关的教导，讨论政治与业务的关系问题，批判修正主义的流毒，一面学习解放军的政治工作经验，采取了一系列革命的措施。
    指挥部首先采取了政治、生产统一指挥的组织形式，以政治统帅生产，领导生产。过去，旧县委负责政治思想工作的部门，与生产部门很少配合，生产一忙，就把政治工作挤掉了，政治工作人员变成单纯的“生产干部”。现在，指挥部在建立和健全县、社、大队三级生产班子的同时，也建立和健全了政治工作机构，作为各级指挥机构的主要组成部分。在统一领导和安排下，全县生产第一线的政治工作十分活跃，在掀起春耕生产高潮的同时，出现了学习毛主席著作的新高潮。各生产队白天坚持田头学毛主席语录，每周固定几个晚上组织社员学习毛主席著作。各级政治工作部门最近还大力加强干部工作，组织干部、社员学习毛主席的干部政策和《红旗》杂志有关社论，帮助干部挺起腰板，做好工作。不少公社和大队召开了政治工作会议，毛主席著作学习讲用会，树立典型，交流经验，使广大社员、干部以饱满的政治热情投入春耕生产。
    指挥部在布置、检查、总结工作时，首先布置、检查、总结毛主席著作学习的情况。指挥部成立一个多月来，每开一次会，布置一项工作，都坚持这一原则，特别着重反复宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的战略方针，和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》以及党中央有关政策指示，用毛泽东思想来统一认识、解决矛盾。最近县指挥部召开一次公社领导干部参加的生产汇报会，一反过去开会就报数字、分指标、要东西的旧一套。会上首先汇报了各公社开展毛主席著作学习运动的情况和问题，反映出许多好人好事和干部、群众的活思想，使这次生产会议成为一次政治工作会议。
    县指挥部还把各个业务部门派到农村的大批干部组织起来，成为一支政治工作队。过去在旧县委提出的“带指标下乡，带产量回来”的抵制政治挂帅的口号下，许多下乡干部经常为催生产进度、搞数字统计而奔忙。现在，他们首先把宣传毛泽东思想作为首位任务，把调查研究、阶级分析做为下乡干部的基本功。这些干部一到农村就与社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习毛主席著作，进行调查研究，支持革命派，团结革命干部搞好春耕生产。经过一段实践，下乡干部深有体会地说：过去只抓生产不问政治，真是寸步难行；现在抓革命，促生产，一通百通。
    为了适应全县突出政治的新形势，县指挥部相应地树立了革命的工作作风。过去每到春耕季节，县的生产领导部门都要忙于处理农业生产资料的供应和分配。今年，指挥部首先组织有关部门进行了调查，严格按照自力更生的原则，根据社队实际需要合理分配物资、资金，坚决不搞物质刺激，大大减少了指挥部的烦琐事务工作。过去县里的生产领导部门经常忙于统计数字，指挥部成立后，坚决不搞“数字挂帅”，不以数字多少评价工作优劣，这样就使不少干部从烦琐的统计工作中摆脱出来。现在这个县的指挥部有四分之三的工作人员深入到生产第一线及时了解情况，掌握社员、干部的思想动向，了解群众的要求和研究生产中的问题，使指挥部能根据实际情况和农时，及时有力的指挥生产。
