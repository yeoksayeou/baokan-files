The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the mountainous areas of Zhejiang Province are vigorously planting tea oil trees during the spring afforestation campaign. According to preliminary statistics from twenty-five counties, over one million one hundred thousand mu have already been planted.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the mountainous areas of Zhejiang believe that developing tea oil trees on the mountains can free up arable land for grain cultivation, thereby more powerfully supporting the country's socialist construction and the world revolution. This is also a powerful measure to implement Chairman Mao's great strategic directive of "being prepared for war, being prepared for famine, and serving the people." Therefore, this year, not only has the amount of tea oil trees planted increased, but the planting quality has also improved compared to previous years.

    浙江种一百多万亩油茶
    浙江省山区广大贫下中农在春季造林中大种油茶。据二十五个县的初步统计，已经种了一百一十万亩。
    浙江山区的广大贫下中农认为，向山上发展油茶，可以腾出种油茶的良田来种粮食，更有力地支援国家的社会主义建设和世界革命，这也是执行毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”这一伟大战略方针的有力措施。因此，今年油茶不仅种得多，而且种植质量也比以往几年好。
