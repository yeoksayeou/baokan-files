The proletarian revolutionary masses in the capital's scientific and technological circles held a mass rally of 15,000 people on April 10 at the Beijing Workers' Stadium to angrily denounce and expose the crimes of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party who had extended his black hands into the scientific and technological circles, frantically pushing the bourgeois reactionary line, and using the infamous poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" to corrupt people's minds, in an attempt to achieve a capitalist restoration in our country.

Zhang Ben, a responsible person from the Revolutionary Committee of the State Science and Technology Commission, was the first to speak. She said that in the midst of the victorious songs of the proletarian revolutionary masses' struggle for power, the proletarian revolutionary masses and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people on all fronts, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, are verbally and in writing denouncing and exposing the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. At this critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary scientific workers on the scientific and technological front must also firmly hold high the great banner of proletarian revolution, actively participate in this great criticism and struggle, launch a total attack and settlement on the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, and thoroughly criticize it politically, ideologically, and theoretically. Zhang Ben angrily pointed out that "Self-Cultivation" is the representative work of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party's counter-revolutionary revisionism, his program for usurping the Party and the government, and the theoretical and ideological basis for his push for the bourgeois reactionary line. She said that this poisonous weed of anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought must be thoroughly uprooted, and the spiritual shackles he has put on people must be smashed. Zhang Ben finally expressed that in this great criticism and struggle, the proletarian revolutionary masses in the scientific and technological circles must closely combine with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line on the scientific and technological front, overthrow, smash, and expose the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; at the same time, they must also carry out a thorough criticism of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. Through this great criticism and struggle, they must raise the level of struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units and plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the scientific and technological front in our country.

A representative from the Joint Seizure of Power Headquarters of the Revolutionary Rebel Faction of the Chinese Academy of Sciences strongly denounced the crimes of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party who had extended his black hands into the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He said that the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, together with another major capitalist-roader within the Party, had personally taken the lead in frantically peddling capitalist and revisionist black goods with a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the scientific and technological circles, frantically opposing Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary line of science advocated by Chairman Mao, attempting to lead our country's scientific and technological work onto the revisionist road, and committing heinous crimes against the Party and the people. He revealed that the number one capitalist-roader within the Party had also maliciously slandered the great leap forward in our country's scientific and technological work since 1958, shouting slogans to "correct deviations" and "reflect," attempting to completely negate the great movement launched by the broad masses of revolutionary scientific workers in response to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to be self-reliant and strive for progress, and completely negate the policy of combining theory with practice proposed by Chairman Mao. Under the support of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the scientific and technological circles, together with reactionary academic "authorities," engaged in reactionary research of restoring the old and worshipping the foreign, cutting off the research tasks related to the construction and consolidation of socialism and national defense, and engaging in pure theoretical research detached from reality. He said that this number one capitalist-roader within the Party also wanted us to apologize to bourgeois intellectuals. Under the instigation and support of this backstage manipulator, a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Chinese Academy of Sciences kowtowed to bourgeois intellectuals and engaged in so-called "political compensation."

The representative from the Joint Seizure of Power Headquarters of the Revolutionary Rebel Faction of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said that Party leadership is an important guarantee for the development of our country's scientific and technological undertakings. The question of whether or not the Party leads scientific and technological work is a major principle of whether or not to take the socialist road. The number one capitalist-roader within the Party, however, vigorously advocated the abolition of the Party's leadership over scientific and technological work, handing over the leadership of research work to bourgeois intellectuals.

He angrily pointed out that the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, in order to make our country's socialist scientific and technological undertakings degenerate into tools for capitalist restoration and cultivate successors of the bourgeoisie, vigorously advocated the establishment of the "degree" and "academic title" system in the scientific and technological circles, vigorously promoting the bourgeois rubbish of "professor," "doctor," and "associate doctor." He said that the great leader Chairman Mao had long ago wisely instructed that we should not engage in medals and doctorates, but this Chinese Khrushchev openly defied Chairman Mao, saying that the "degree and title system is worth studying." In addition, he also advocated in the scientific and technological circles the white specialist road of no revolution and no politics, promoting high salaries, high rewards, and high royalties for the bourgeoisie; instructing a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists entrenched within the Academy to promote those who are only experts and not red, so-called "business elites," attempting to lead the broad masses of revolutionary scientific workers onto the bourgeois and revisionist path.

The representative from the Red Guard Brigade of the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department angrily criticized the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation." He said that Chairman Mao taught us: "We must be especially vigilant against personal careerists and conspirators like Khrushchev and prevent such bad guys from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state at all levels." The number one capitalist-roader within the Party is China's Khrushchev, the greatest personal careerist and conspirator against the Party. His deceptive and widely poisonous representative work "Self-Cultivation" is his program for usurping the Party and the state. This book frantically attacks the great leader Chairman Mao, strenuously opposes our Party's invincible guiding ideology of Mao Zedong Thought, and attempts to change the nature of our Party. He said that Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts, and Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, we will overthrow them. He said that Chairman Mao taught us that the fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power. However, "Self-Cultivation" does not mention the question of state power. Before the proletariat seizes state power, it is a counter-revolutionary program that does not want revolution, does not want to seize state power, and does not want to establish proletarian dictatorship. After the proletariat seizes state power, it is a usurping program that subverts proletarian dictatorship and turns proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. The question of the line is the question of the direction of which road to take and where to go. The struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the number one capitalist-roader within the Party is the reflection within the Party of the life-and-death struggle between the two classes and the two roads in society.

The representative from the Red Guard Brigade of the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department said that the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, at every critical moment in history, throws out "Self-Cultivation" to eliminate the struggle of lines and advocate "peace within the Party," in order to resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, attempt to reverse the rolling forward of the historical wheel, and pull our country back onto the capitalist dead end, in order to achieve his evil goal of usurping the Party and the state. He said that "Self-Cultivation" also vigorously promotes the decadent bourgeois individualist worldview, advocates slavery, and promotes the feudal scholar-official's "self-cultivation and character building." This poisonous weed is a program to cultivate successors of the bourgeoisie and create capitalist-roaders within the Party; it is a program to attempt to make our Party and state "peacefully evolve" through a bloodless method. The representative from the Red Guard Brigade finally angrily pointed out that "Self-Cultivation" is the program of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party to usurp the Party and the state, and it is his declaration of capitalist restoration. If his plot is allowed to succeed, our Party and state will change color, and the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs will be in vain. "Only heroes drive tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and tigers." We proletarian revolutionaries on the scientific and technological front must rise up with the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, wield pens as swords and spears, thoroughly smash this program, thoroughly bury this declaration, overthrow and expose China's Khrushchev, and make him never be able to rise again.

Li Dunbai, an expert from the Broadcasting Administration Bureau and an American friend, also spoke at the meeting. In his speech, he warmly wished the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life. He said that we wish Chairman Mao eternal life because only Chairman Mao's teachings can guide the revolutionary factions of various countries to rebel against the old world and carry the world revolution to the end. Only Chairman Mao's teachings can guide the revolutionary factions of various countries to become frank, loyal, active, "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, always adhering to principles and fighting against all wrong words and deeds, selfless and fearless communists; only Chairman Mao's teachings can guide the revolutionary factions of various countries to raise their awareness of fighting against the enemy and their awareness of the struggle between the two lines within the revolutionary ranks, regard the liberation cause of the people of various countries as their own cause, and forever preserve the revolutionary youth of proletarian internationalism.

Li Dunbai gave a profound criticism and denunciation of the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation." He said that this poisonous weed has had a very wide poisonous influence in the world, causing extremely bad effects, and has been widely circulated in the brother parties of many countries, poisoning many proletarian revolutionaries in many countries. Li Dunbai said that this poisonous weed, because it caters to the needs of imperialism, the New York Times of the American imperialists had long ago maliciously hyped up this number one capitalist-roader within the Party as the so-called Marxist-Leninist theorist within the Chinese Party, attempting to use his counter-revolutionary revisionist theory to resist the thought of Mao Zedong, which can liberate all mankind, in the world. Li Dunbai pointed out that in "Self-Cultivation," it is said that if a Communist Party member cultivates himself well, he should be obedient and docile, not cause trouble, and even if he sees evil activities that harm the interests of the people, he should not be angry or fight, using the decadent capitalist philosophy of "suffering small losses to gain big benefits" to corrupt the revolutionary factions, making Communist Party members become his slaves and docile tools. Li Dunbai finally pointed out that the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" must be thoroughly exposed, thoroughly criticized, and thoroughly eliminated from its evil influence in the world. Only in this way can we fulfill our sacred duty to the people of all countries.

Representatives from the "Red Flag" Revolutionary Rebel Team of the Chinese Academy of Forestry and the Red Flag Combat Team of the Chinese Academy of Agriculture also criticized and denounced at the meeting the crimes of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party who maliciously attacked the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, advocated the theory of the extinction of class struggle, strongly promoted individual farming, and advocated material incentives, the expert line, and technology first, as well as the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique" in personnel issues.

The more than 15,000 revolutionary scientific workers present at the meeting were indignant and filled with righteous anger at the heinous crimes of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. During the meeting, people repeatedly waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and raised their arms, shouting: "Overthrow the number one capitalist-roader within the Party!" "Thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line!" "Criticize 'Self-Cultivation' thoroughly, expose it thoroughly, and overthrow it!" "The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is victorious forever!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

    一定把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全国科学技术界  彻底斩断党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的黑手
    首都科学技术界无产阶级革命派大集会狠批反革命修正主义黑货
    大毒草《修养》必须彻底揭发，彻底批判，彻底清除它在全世界的流毒
    新华社十三日讯　首都科学技术界无产阶级革命派一万五千余人十日在北京工人体育馆举行集会，愤怒声讨和控诉党内头号走资本主义道路当权派把黑手伸进科学技术界，疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线，用臭名昭著的大毒草《修养》腐蚀人心，妄图在我国实现资本主义复辟的滔天罪行。
    国家科委革命委员会负责人张本首先致词。她说，在无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的凯歌声中，各条战线上的无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，口诛笔伐，愤怒声讨党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战时刻，科学技术战线上的无产阶级革命派和革命的科学工作者也一定要高举无产阶级革命的批判大旗，积极投入这场大批判、大斗争，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线发动总攻击、总清算，把它从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，批倒批臭。张本愤怒指出，《修养》是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义的代表作，是他篡党、篡政的纲领，是他推行资产阶级反动路线的理论基础和思想基础。她说，一定要把这株反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的大毒草彻底铲除，砸烂他套在人们身上的精神枷锁。张本最后表示，在这场大批判、大斗争中，科学技术界的无产阶级革命派要紧密结合本单位的斗、批、改，彻底批判科学技术战线上的反革命修正主义路线，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，斩断党内头号走资本主义道路当权派伸进科学技术界的黑手；同时也要对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派进行全面、彻底的批判，通过这场大批判、大斗争，提高本单位的斗、批、改水平，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍我国科学技术战线。
    中国科学院革命造反派联合夺权总部的代表，在大会上强烈控诉了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派把黑手伸进中国科学院的滔天罪行。他说，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派伙同党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派，曾亲自赤膊上阵，同科学技术界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子共同疯狂贩卖资本主义和修正主义的黑货，疯狂反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席办科学的革命路线，妄图把我国的科学技术工作引上修正主义道路，对党对人民犯下了滔天罪行。他揭发说，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派还大肆污蔑一九五八年以来我国科学技术工作的大跃进，叫嚷要“纠偏”、“检讨”，企图全盘否定我国广大革命的科学工作者响应伟大领袖毛主席自力更生、奋发图强的号召开展的群众运动，全盘否定毛主席提出的理论联系实际的方针。在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，科学技术界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子同反动学术“权威”大搞复古崇洋的研究，把关系社会主义建设和巩固国防大事的研究任务砍掉，去搞脱离实际的纯理论研究。他说，这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派还要我们向资产阶级知识分子“赔礼道歉”。在这个总后台的策动和支持下，中国科学院内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，向资产阶级知识分子屈膝投降，大搞所谓“政治退赔”。
    中国科学院革命造反派联合夺权总部的代表说，党的领导是发展我国科学技术事业的重要保证，要不要党对科学技术的领导，是要不要走社会主义道路的大是大非问题。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却极力主张取消党对科学技术工作的领导，把研究工作的领导权拱手送给资产阶级知识分子。
    他愤怒指出，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为了使我国社会主义的科学技术事业蜕化为复辟资本主义的工具，培养资产阶级接班人，还在科学技术界大肆鼓吹搞“学位”、“学衔”制度，大肆宣扬“教授”、“博士”、“副博士”这一套资本主义的破烂。他说，伟大领袖毛主席早在一九六○年就曾英明地指示不搞勋章、博士这些东西，但是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫却公然对抗毛主席，胡说什么“学位学衔制度搞不搞值得研究。”此外，他还在科学技术界鼓吹不要革命、不要政治的白专道路，提倡资产阶级的高工资、高奖励、高稿酬；指使盘踞在科学院内的一小撮反革命修正主义分子提拔那些只专不红的所谓“业务尖子”，企图把广大革命的科学工作者引入资产阶级、修正主义的歧途。
    毛泽东思想哲学社会科学部红卫兵联队的代表在会上愤怒批判了大毒草《修养》。他说，毛主席教导我们：“要特别警惕象赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导”。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是中国的赫鲁晓夫，就是反党篡国的最大的个人野心家和阴谋家。他那本欺世骗人、流毒甚广的代表作《修养》，就是他反党篡国的纲领。这本书，疯狂地攻击伟大领袖毛主席，竭力反对我们党战无不胜的指导思想毛泽东思想，妄图改变我们党的性质。他说，毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。谁反对毛主席和毛泽东思想，我们就打倒谁。他说，毛主席教导我们，革命的根本问题是政权问题。而《修养》却闭口不谈政权问题，在无产阶级夺取政权以前，它是不要革命，不要夺取政权，不要建立无产阶级专政的反革命纲领。在无产阶级夺取政权以后，它又是颠覆无产阶级专政，把无产阶级专政蜕化成资产阶级专政的篡国纲领。路线问题是走什么道路，往何处去的方向问题。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线的斗争，是社会上两个阶级、两条道路的殊死搏斗在党内的反映。
    哲学社会科学部红卫兵联队的代表说，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，在每个历史时期的关键时刻都抛出抹杀路线斗争、鼓吹“党内和平”的《修养》，就是为了对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，妄图扭转滚滚向前的历史车轮，把我国拉回资本主义的死路，以达到他反党篡国的罪恶目的。他说，《修养》还拚命宣扬资产阶级腐朽的个人主义世界观，提倡奴隶主义，鼓吹封建士大夫的“修身养性”。这株大毒草是培养资产阶级接班人、制造党内走资本主义道路当权派的纲领；是妄图用杀人不见血的办法，使我们党和国家“和平演变”。红卫兵联队的代表最后愤怒指出，《修养》是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反党篡国的纲领，是他复辟资本主义的宣言书。如果让他的阴谋得逞，我们的党和国家就要变颜色，无数革命先烈的鲜血就会付之东流。“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴”，我们科学技术战线上的无产阶级革命派要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，挥笔作刀枪，彻底砸烂这个纲领，彻底埋葬这个宣言书，把中国的赫鲁晓夫斗倒、斗臭，使他永世不得翻身。
    应邀参加大会的广播事业局专家、美国朋友李敦白也在会上讲话。他在讲话中热烈祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆。他说，我们祝愿毛主席万寿无疆，因为只有毛主席的教导才能引导各国的革命派去造旧世界的反，把世界革命进行到底。只有毛主席的教导，才能引导各国的革命派成为坦白、忠实、积极、“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的、始终坚持原则并同一切错误言行作斗争的无私无畏的共产主义战士；只有毛主席的教导，才能引导各国的革命派提高对敌斗争的觉悟，提高革命队伍内部对两条路线斗争的觉悟，把各国人民的解放事业当作自己的事业，永葆无产阶级国际主义的革命青春。
    李敦白对大毒草《修养》作了深刻的批判和控诉。他说，这株大毒草在全世界流毒很广，起了极为恶劣的影响，在许多国家的兄弟党内广为流传，毒害了许多国家的无产阶级革命者。李敦白说，这株大毒草由于迎合了帝国主义的需要，美帝国主义的《纽约时报》好多年以前就曾别有用心地把这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派吹捧为中国党内的所谓马克思列宁主义理论家，企图用他的反革命修正主义理论在世界范围内抵制能够解放全人类的毛泽东思想。李敦白指出，《修养》中谈到共产党员修养好，就是要听话、驯服，不要闹事，甚至见了损害人民利益的罪恶活动也不要气愤、斗争，拿资本主义的腐朽的“吃小亏、占大便宜”的人生哲学来腐蚀革命派，让共产党员充当他的奴隶和驯服工具。李敦白最后指出，大毒草《修养》必须彻底揭发、彻底批判，彻底清除它在全世界范围内的恶劣影响，只有这样，才能尽到我们对世界各国人民的神圣义务。
    中国林业科学研究院“红旗”革命造反团、中国农业科学院红旗战斗团的代表等，也在会上批判和控诉了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派恶毒攻击战无不胜的毛泽东思想，鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，大刮单干风，宣扬物质刺激、专家路线和技术第一，以及在干部问题上实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的罪行。
    到会的一万五千多名革命的科学工作者，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行同仇敌忾，义愤填膺。会议进行中间，人们不断挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，振臂高呼：“打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派！”“彻底批判资产阶级反动路线！”“把《修养》批透、批臭、批倒！”“以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
