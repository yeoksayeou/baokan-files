Since the publication of the editorials in the fourth and fifth issues of *Red Flag* magazine, we have fully mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and addressed the ideological tendencies in dealing with cadres. We have studied and implemented Chairman Mao's works and policies on cadres. Most of the section-level and above cadres in the original Provincial Party Committee Office have now stood up to revolutionize, and many have "come out" to promote the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Our approach to helping and educating the majority of cadres to stand up to revolutionize is: "One Look, Two Help, Three Combine."

(1)

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at identifying cadres. Not only should we look at a cadre's actions in a single instance, but we should also look at the cadre's entire history and all their work. This is the main method for identifying cadres."

"One Look": This means mobilizing the masses to truly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought to examine and identify cadres, using class analysis to deal with cadres, and strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions. For the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must resolutely overthrow them and never allow the enemy to infiltrate the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" power structure. For those who have made serious mistakes but whose mistakes are not of an antagonistic nature, we actively strive to educate and create conditions for them to stand up to revolutionize.

In the practical struggle of the Cultural Revolution, we revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses have a clear understanding of the nature and extent of the mistakes made by cadres who have made mistakes. To distinguish between the two types of contradictions, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the cadres in our unit. Through the "four looks" (looking at direction, looking at line, looking at nature, looking at attitude), we strictly delineated the boundaries between the third and fourth categories of cadres. In the struggle, we looked at whether they were on the socialist road or the capitalist road; whether they firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line or stubbornly stood on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line; whether they were cadres who made serious mistakes in their work or anti-Party, anti-socialist elements; whether they were willing to correct their mistakes or were incorrigible. Through such class analysis, we clearly saw that the majority of cadres in our unit were good and wanted to revolutionize, while only a handful were anti-Party, anti-socialist elements who refused to change.

Regarding the issue of the former deputy director of the Office, there were initially two views among the masses: one believed his problems were serious and wanted to hold him accountable; the other believed that although his mistakes were serious, he was not an anti-Party, anti-socialist element. In such a situation, we systematically reviewed his issues, identifying five aspects: emphasizing work over politics; having serious thoughts of fame and wealth, writing some bad works; living in luxury, detached from the masses; actively implementing the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution; and losing his stance and making serious mistakes during the movement. After a comprehensive analysis, the masses believed that his family background was good, and he had not been in a leadership position for long. Although he had said some wrong things and written some bad articles, they were not of an anti-Party, anti-socialist nature. Therefore, we actively worked to win him over and educate him, giving him the opportunity to "come out." Through the masses' urging and individual talks, we looked at his recognition and attitude towards his mistakes; through the mass meeting to "come out," we looked at the depth of his self-criticism; through the criticism meeting, we looked at whether he had drawn a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road and with the bourgeois reactionary line, testing his revolutionary spirit. Initially, he did not dare to reveal his true thoughts or hand over the drafts of his erroneous articles, fearing that if he handed over too many, his problems would be exposed "beyond the limit." In the masses' urging meeting, we pointed out his problems directly, helping him to initially correct his attitude. In one meeting, he was the first to stand up to "come out," revealing some dirty things from the depths of his soul. Later, he also made a relatively profound self-criticism and criticism of his mistakes in the mass meeting. After his self-criticism, the masses immediately held a discussion, believing that his self-criticism was relatively profound and that he had the determination to correct his mistakes. Finally, after the masses' evaluation and the core group's approval, he was sent to work at the Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members should not adopt an exclusionary attitude towards those who have made mistakes in their work, except for those who are beyond redemption. Instead, they should adopt an advisory attitude, helping them to change and improve, leaving the old and seeking the new."

"Two Help": This means following Chairman Mao's instructions, adhering to the policy of "punishing past mistakes and preventing future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient," and adopting the method of "unity-criticism-unity." We follow the mass line, mobilize the masses, and do detailed and thorough work to help cadres who have made mistakes to recognize and correct their mistakes, so that they can quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Our specific approach is:

First, mobilize the masses to seriously and earnestly criticize the mistakes of cadres. To make cadres who have made mistakes recognize their mistakes and bravely stand up to revolutionize, we must mobilize the masses to, based on Mao Zedong Thought, seriously and earnestly criticize their mistakes. Only in this way can we achieve new unity on a new basis. For example, a former deputy director of the Office's Letter and Visit Reception Room implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution and made serious mistakes. However, he carried the burden of good family background and good class status, believing that although there were some problems in his work, they were all "assigned from above" and "there were no mistakes." Because he had no recognition of the seriousness of his mistakes, his first self-criticism was not satisfactory. We conducted a serious and profound criticism of him. Although he could not accept it at the time, it indeed touched his soul, and he had a fierce internal struggle for several days, unable to sleep or eat well. Under the help of the red revolutionaries, he brought his problems to study "Three Articles" and other brilliant works and the editorial in the fourth issue of *Red Flag* magazine, compared and checked, and realized that he had indeed gone against Chairman Mao's teachings and made serious mistakes. He also realized that the revolutionary masses' severe criticism of him was out of concern, education, and rescue for him, thus overcoming the feelings of "grievance" and "resistance," and re-recognizing his mistakes. In his second self-criticism, his recognition of his mistakes was relatively profound. From the process of criticizing his mistakes, we deeply felt that bourgeois ideology is very stubborn. If we indulge cadres' mistakes without principles, we cannot cause them to have ideological shocks, touch their souls, and make them recognize and correct their mistakes.

Second, mobilize the masses, and everyone does ideological work. We mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to, following the policy of "punishing past mistakes and preventing future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient," use Mao Zedong Thought to help cadres who have made mistakes, forming a situation where everyone does ideological work among the division's duty group comrades, red revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and cadres who have made mistakes. We assigned them to study Chairman Mao's relevant works according to the ideological trends in each period of the cadres; held study and application meetings of Chairman Mao's works; mobilized all red revolutionaries and revolutionary masses to divide tasks and take responsibility for individual talks; and advocated that comrades who had a deeper recognition of their mistakes help those who had a shallower recognition of their mistakes. All of these had good effects. For example, the former director of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee Office had just transferred from the army to the local area when the Cultural Revolution reached its peak. Due to his lack of understanding of the Cultural Revolution, he made mistakes in implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. Initially, he felt very wronged and "unlucky," unable to accept the criticism of the revolutionary masses. We studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and Comrade Lin Biao's relevant speeches with him. After studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "We Communist Party members should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the great storm of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses' struggle," he realized that participating in this unprecedented Cultural Revolution was a good opportunity to be tested and tempered. If his bourgeois worldview was not transformed, he would make bigger mistakes in the future. Thus, he began to seriously check and criticize his mistakes. We deeply felt that only by grasping the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, grasping the active ideology of cadres, mobilizing the masses, and doing ideological work from all aspects, can we make cadres who have made mistakes sincerely correct their mistakes and unite the majority of cadres.

Third, carry out "Two Remembrances and Three Examinations" to help cadres conduct self-class education. We universally carried out the "Two Remembrances and Three Examinations" activity, conducting class education for cadres. On March 3, we organized a remembrance and comparison meeting for leading cadres, where some leading cadres bitterly denounced the evil old society. For example, a former deputy section chief of the Provincial Party Committee Office had a deep hatred for the old society, joining the revolution at the age of twelve and passing the test in the rain of bullets. However, after entering a big city, he could not withstand the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie, and his revolutionary will gradually declined. After the Cultural Revolution began, he implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. Before carrying out the "Two Remembrances and Three Examinations," he had insufficient recognition of the seriousness of his mistakes, especially not digging deep into the roots and not touching the soul hard. In this remembrance and comparison meeting, he told everyone about his childhood begging, his parents starving to death, and his tragic and bitter family history. He cried out loud, saying, "I have forgotten my roots, I have forgotten the pain. In the future, I will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, not forget class bitterness and blood hatred, always be alert to the attack of the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets, and prevent peaceful evolution." After this meeting, a mass remembrance activity was formed, and many cadres linked their thoughts to have discussions. Everyone felt that this was indeed a vivid and profound class education class.

Fourth, organize cadres who have made mistakes to go to the masses, accepting the help and education of the masses. Some cadres made mistakes because they had been officials for a long time, lacking the class feelings of the working people, fearing the masses, and not daring to revolutionize. To help these cadres who have made mistakes quickly recognize and correct their mistakes, during the movement, we organized eight section-level and above cadres who had made mistakes of different degrees to participate in labor at the car team, property management office, printing room, and canteen, letting them contact the masses and accept the help of the masses. In labor, the red revolutionaries and revolutionary masses of the production and service units actively helped them, and they generally reflected that they received profound education by going to labor with the task of transforming their thoughts. A cadre originally did not agree with being assigned to work in the canteen, saying, "I am not a member of the black gang, why should I work with them." He was not enthusiastic about labor and his self-criticism of his problems was not profound, and the masses had many opinions. Through the patient help of the red revolutionaries and worker masses, his thoughts gradually changed, and he recognized the seriousness of his mistakes. He revealed his true thoughts, deeply settled his mistakes over the years, and his recognition was relatively profound.

(3)

On the basis of "One Look, Two Help," we resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, strictly executed Chairman Mao's policies on cadres, and truly relied on the masses to do a good job in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

First, we carried out the struggle between the two lines and the two ideologies among the masses. We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's relevant works and the editorials in the fourth and fifth issues of *Red Flag* magazine, firmly opposing the erroneous tendency of overthrowing everything, excluding everything, "striking a large area and protecting a small number"; and firmly opposing the erroneous tendency of using the excuse of "three-in-one combination" to engage in centrism, conciliation, and eclecticism, creating a big mess, thoroughly purging the evil influence of the bourgeois reactionary line on the issue of cadres, and repelling the tide of capitalist restoration.

Second, for cadres who have made mistakes, on the basis of repeated criticism and patient help, we boldly use them. Those who have deeply criticized their mistakes and shown signs of repentance, drawn a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and drawn a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line, truly standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we unite with them to work according to the principle of revolution without distinction of seniority. For cadres who have stood up to revolutionize, we give them great support, assign them work to do, and timely solve their ideological and practical problems in their progress, encouraging them to revolutionize to the end.

Third, for cadres who have "come out," have profound self-criticism, and have shown good performance, we send them to work at the Provincial Revolutionary Committee according to the needs of the work. Currently, seventeen revolutionary cadres have been sent. The process of the masses discussing the sending of cadres is the process of the masses re-educating, raising, and helping cadres.

    一看  二帮  三结合
    ——走群众路线教育团结干部的体会
    原中共黑龙江省委机关毛泽东思想红色造反团全无敌分团
    自《红旗》杂志第四、五期社论发表以来，我们充分发动群众，依靠群众，针对在对待干部问题上的思想倾向，活学活用毛主席著作，认真贯彻了毛主席的干部政策。原省委办公厅的处科级以上干部中现在大多数已经起来革命，纷纷“亮相”，促进了革命的“三结合”。我们帮助教育大多数干部起来革命的做法，就是：“一看二帮三结合”。
    （一）
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”
    “一看”：就是发动群众真正按照毛主席的指示，用毛泽东思想去考察、识别干部，用阶级分析的方法去对待干部，严格区别两类不同性质的矛盾。对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，坚决打倒，绝不让敌人混入革命的“三结合”权力机构；对虽犯有严重错误，但还不属于敌我矛盾性质的干部，我们就积极争取教育，给他创造条件，促使他们起来革命。
    在文化大革命斗争实践中，我们红色造反者和广大革命群众，对犯错误干部的问题性质、错误程度，心中都有一本账。为了区分两类不同性质的矛盾，我们对本单位干部进行了全面分析，通过“四看”（看方向，看路线，看性质，看态度），严格地划分了三、四类干部的界限。我们在斗争中，看他们是走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路；看他们是坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，还是顽固地站在资产阶级反动路线一边；看他们是属于工作中犯有严重错误，还是反党反社会主义分子；看他们是知错必改，还是累教不改。经过这样的阶级分析，我们清楚看到，本单位大多数干部是好的，是要革命的，反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，只是一小撮。
    对原办公厅副主任的问题，开始在群众中有两种认识，一种认为他的问题严重，有揪住不放的情绪；一种认为他的错误虽然严重，但还不是反党反社会主义分子。在这样的情况下，我们对他的问题进行了系统的梳辫子，共梳出五个方面的问题，即：只重业务，不突出政治；有严重名利思想，写过一些坏作品；生活不艰苦，养尊处优，脱离群众；在文化大革命中积极执行了资产阶级反动路线；在运动中一度丧失立场，犯过严重错误。经过全面分析研究，群众认为，他家庭出身还好，担任领导工作为时不久；虽然说过一些错话，写过一些不好的文章，但还不是反党反社会主义性质的问题。因此我们对他积极做争取教育工作，给以“亮相”机会。通过群众敦促和个别谈话，看他对错误的认识和态度；通过大会“亮相”，看他对错误的检查程度；通过批判大会，看他是否同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清了界限，是否同资产阶级反动路线划清了界限，考验他的革命造反精神。开始他不敢亮真实思想，不敢交出错误文章底稿，怕交出多了，问题暴露“过了杠”。我们在群众敦促会上，一针见血地指出他的问题，帮助他初步端正了态度。在一次会上，他最先站出来“亮相”，亮出自己灵魂深处一些肮脏的东西。接着，他又在群众大会上，比较深刻地检查、批判了自己的错误。他检查以后，群众及时进行了座谈讨论，认为他的检查较为深刻，并有改正错误的决心，最后经群众评议，分团核心审定，将他输送到省革命委员会工作。
    （二）
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对于在工作中犯过错误的人们，除了不可救药者外，不是采取排斥态度，而是采取规劝态度，使之翻然改进，弃旧图新。”
    “二帮”：就是按毛主席的教导，本着“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，采取“团结——批评——团结”的方法，走群众路线，广泛发动群众，多做深入细致的工作，帮助犯错误的干部认识错误和改正错误，使他们尽快地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    我们的具体做法是：
    第一，发动群众，对干部的错误进行严肃认真的批判。
    为使犯错误的干部认识错误，勇敢地站起来革命，就必须发动群众，根据毛泽东思想，对他们的错误进行严肃认真的批判。只有这样，才能在新的基础上达到新的团结。如原办公厅信访接待室一位副主任在文化大革命中，执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了严重错误。但他背上了出身好、成分好等包袱，认为工作中虽有些问题，但都是“上指下派”，“没有什么错误”。由于他对自己所犯错误的严重性毫无认识，第一次的检查很不象样子，我们就对他进行了严肃深刻的批判。虽然当时他还接受不了，但确实触动了他的灵魂，几天睡不好觉，吃不好饭，思想斗争相当激烈。他在红色造反者的帮助下，带着自己的问题，学习了“老三篇”等光辉著作和《红旗》杂志第四期社论，对照检查，认识到了自己确实违背了毛主席的教导，犯了严重的错误。也认识到革命群众严厉批判他，是为了关心他，教育他，挽救他，从而克服了“委屈”、“抵触”情绪，重新认识自己的错误。在第二次检查时，对错误的认识就比较深刻了。从批判他的错误过程中，我们深深感到，资产阶级思想是很顽固的，对干部的错误，如果无原则地迁就，就不能引起他们思想上的震动，就不能触及灵魂，就不能促使他们认识和改正错误。
    第二，发动群众，人人动手，作艰苦细致的思想工作。
    我们发动广大革命群众，按照“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，用毛泽东思想去帮助犯错误干部，形成分团勤务组同志、红色造反者、革命群众以及犯错误干部之间人人都做思想工作的局面。我们针对干部中每个时期的活思想，指定他们学习毛主席有关著作；召开学习毛主席著作讲用会；发动全体红色造反者和革命群众分工包干，个别谈话；还提倡认识错误较深刻的同志用亲身体会帮助认识错误比较差的同志。所有这些都收到了良好的效果。如原省委办公厅机要处长刚从部队转业到地方就赶上文化大革命的高潮，由于对文化大革命不理解，犯了执行资产阶级反动路线的错误。开始他总感到很委屈、很“倒霉”，对革命群众的批判接受不了。我们和他一起带着问题学习毛主席的有关教导和林彪同志的有关讲话。他学习了毛主席关于“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面”的教导以后，认识到参加这场史无前例的文化大革命，正是经受考验和锻炼的好机会。如果自己的资产阶级世界观不改造，将来会犯更大的错误。于是他开始认真地检查批判自己的错误。我们深深地感到，只有狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓干部的活思想，发动群众，人人动手，从多方面进行思想工作，才能使犯错误干部心悦诚服，迅速改正错误，团结干部的大多数。
    第三，开展“两忆三查”，帮助干部进行自我阶级教育。
    我们普遍地开展了“两忆三查”活动，对干部进行了阶级教育。三月三日，我们组织了领导干部的忆苦思甜会，一些领导干部在会上对万恶的旧社会进行了血泪的控诉。如原省委办公厅一位副处长在旧社会苦大仇深，十二岁就参加了革命，在枪林弹雨中经受住了考验。但是进入大城市以后，经不起资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击，革命意志逐渐衰退。文化大革命开始后，他执行了资产阶级反动路线。在开展“两忆三查”之前，他一直对自己所犯错误的严重性认识不足，特别是对根源挖得不深，对灵魂触得不狠。在这次忆苦思甜的会上，他向大家讲述了他童年讨饭、父母被饿死的悲惨苦难的家史，他痛哭失声地说：“我忘本了，我好了疮疤忘了疼。今后一定牢记毛主席的教导，不忘阶级苦、血泪仇，时刻警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻，防止和平演变。”这次会后形成了群众性的忆苦活动，许多干部都联系自己的思想进行了座谈。大家感到，这确实是一堂生动深刻的阶级教育课。
    第四，组织犯错误干部到群众中去，接受群众帮助、教育。
    有些干部所以犯错误，原因之一就是长期当官做老爷，缺乏劳动人民的阶级感情，害怕群众，不敢革命。为了帮助这些犯错误的干部迅速认识、改正错误，在运动期间，我们组织了八名犯有不同程度错误的处科级干部，到汽车队、房产科、铅印室、食堂等单位参加劳动，让他们接触群众，接受群众的帮助。在劳动中，生产服务单位的红色造反者和革命群众主动帮助他们，他们普遍反映，带着改造思想的任务去劳动，受到的教育很深刻。一位干部对确定他去食堂劳动，原先思想不通，说：“我也不是黑帮，为啥叫我和他们在一起劳动。”他劳动不积极，对自己问题的检查也很不深刻，群众意见很大。经过红色造反者和工人群众的耐心帮助，他的思想逐步有了转变，认识到自己错误的严重性。他说，通过劳动，我认识了自己是在和平演变之中，如果不认真检查，迅速改正，就要滑到修正主义泥坑里去。他亮出了真实思想，沉痛地清算了多年来的错误，认识比较深刻。
    （三）
    在一看二帮的基础上，我们坚决贯彻毛主席的指示，不折不扣地执行毛主席的干部政策，真正依靠群众，搞好革命的“三结合”。
    首先，在群众中开展两条路线、两种思想的斗争。我们反复学习了毛主席的有关著作和《红旗》杂志第四、五期社论，既坚决反对打倒一切，排斥一切，“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的错误倾向；又坚决反对借口“三结合”，搞折中主义、调和主义、合二而一，搞大杂烩的错误倾向，彻底肃清在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线的恶劣影响，击退了资本主义复辟逆流。
    其次，对犯错误的干部，在反复批判和耐心帮助的基础上，大胆使用。凡是深刻检讨错误，并有悔改表现，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清了界限，同资产阶级反动路线划清了界限，真正站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来的，就按照革命不分先后的原则，团结他们一道工作。对起来造反的革命干部，都给予极大的支持，交给他们工作做，及时解决他们前进中的思想问题和实际问题，鼓励他们造反到底。
    第三，对已经“亮相”，检查深刻，表现较好的革命干部，根据工作需要，输送到省革命委员会工作。目前已输送十七名革命干部。群众讨论输送干部的过程，就是群众对干部再教育、再提高、再帮助的过程。
