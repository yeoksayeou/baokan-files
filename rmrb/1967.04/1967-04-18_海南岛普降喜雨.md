Hainan Island experienced widespread rainfall from April 12 to 16. This was the first significant rain since last winter. All 18 counties (cities) on the island, except for Yaxian County which received less rain, saw rainfall ranging from 50 to over 170 millimeters.

Hainan Island, which starts its spring planting season the earliest, has not had a good rain for over five months since last winter. This heavy rainfall has basically alleviated or eased the drought conditions on Hainan Island, which is very beneficial for the current growth of early-season rice and the expansion of spring-planted crops.

    海南岛普降喜雨
    新华社海口十七日电　海南岛在四月十二日至十六日普降大雨。这是去冬以来的第一场喜雨。全岛十八个县（市）除了崖县雨量较小外，其它地区都下雨五十到一百七十多毫米。
    春耕季节最早的海南岛，去冬以来已有五个多月没有下过透雨。这场大雨使海南岛出现的旱情基本解除或缓和下来，对于目前早稻生长和扩大春种作物十分有利。
