The Shanghai People's Art Theatre (now known as the Shanghai People's Art Troupe) has, over the course of more than a decade, been controlled by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who have peddled a great deal of revisionist literary and artistic black goods. They have used foreigners and the dead to dominate our socialist stage, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism and creating public opinion in preparation. Through the current campaign of revolutionary criticism, we have clearly seen that the one who formulated this counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line is none other than the mastermind behind Zhou Yang and Xia Yan—the Chinese Khrushchev. Now is the time for a thorough reckoning.

I

Due to this top capitalist-roader within the Party's persistent and stubborn resistance to Chairman Mao's directive to criticize the treacherous film "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty," and his claim that it is a work of "patriotism," Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and other counter-revolutionary revisionists, following the orders of their master, used the poison of this film to open the green light for reactionary plays on the Shanghai stage.

In 1957, a popular drama troupe performed a reactionary version of the film "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty" and the play "Guangxu and Zhenfei," which slandered the Boxer Rebellion, and "Zhang Wenchang Assassination of Ma," which immediately gained the approval of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Deng Han. He praised it highly, recommended it enthusiastically, and arranged for it to be performed in Beijing to raise its profile. In 1960, under the guise of excavating traditions and developing schools, this troupe was stuffed into the Shanghai People's Art Theatre, this black stronghold. "Zhang Wenchang Assassination of Ma" thus became a "repertory play" for Shanghai People's Art Theatre's dialect drama, performed more than a hundred times, spreading a great deal of poison among the audience.

At the same time, the author of another reactionary play, "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty," was brought into Shanghai People's Art Theatre for performing Deng Han's poisonous work "Guan Hanqing." "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty" was born during the War of Resistance and, like the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty," distorted historical facts, slandered revolutionary mass movements, glorified imperialism and feudalism, and propagated bourgeois reformism. When it premiered in Chongqing in 1942, it won the favor of China's biggest reactionary leader, Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang watched the play and, in an unprecedented move, summoned the author for a banquet and a photo opportunity, becoming a notorious incident in the theatrical world at the time. Chairman Mao taught us: "There is no such thing as love without reason, nor is there such a thing as hate without reason." Why did Chiang Kai-shek pay so much attention to this play? It was precisely because it propagated nationalism and class surrenderism, providing strategies for the Chiang clique. Why, in 1962, did the likes of Chen Huangmei be so eager to have the man who was once specially favored by Chiang Kai-shek adapt it into a film, ready to be released again? All this is the result of the top capitalist-roader within the Party protecting and praising the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty," a great exposure of their political conspiracy.

In 1962, when Khrushchev was fervently promoting the "peaceful coexistence" line and praising Kennedy as a "wise" president, the top capitalist-roader within our Party and his cronies were singing the same tune, once again throwing out his black "Cultivation," directing his spearhead at our great leader Chairman Mao, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. His keen-scented henchmen immediately responded, and Xia Yan quickly ordered the author of "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty" to carefully craft a poisonous work according to the taste of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, "The Prince of Loyalty." The script, with an imperialist from the British Empire as the main character, through a story of his experiences in the army of the great traitor Li Xiucheng, attempts to prove that there are so-called "wise men" and "people with clearer minds" in the imperialist camp, openly whitewashing imperialism.

During the three years of natural disasters, the top capitalist-roader within the Party issued another black directive: to slander the Three Red Banners and to vigorously promote "three selfs and one package," stirring up a wind of revisionism, overturning cases, individual farming, and liberalization at home, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism. The ghosts and snakes in the literary and artistic world immediately responded enthusiastically. Deng Han first threw out his old work from before liberation, "The Beauty," which praises traitors and slanders the working class. Others such as "The Gentleman on the Beam," "Recognize Money, Not People," "The World of Money," "Laughing and Crying Marriage," "Borrowed Wife," "The Lady of the Camellias," "The Blunderer" ... all came out, making the Shanghai stage a mess of smoke and poison, with demons flying everywhere.

II

The top capitalist-roader within the Party openly opposed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, opposed serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art, and harbored deep class hatred for the revolutionary literary and artistic troops. In the early days of liberation, he gave Zhou Yang and others a black directive to "slash and kill" revolutionary art troupes, to establish Soviet-style theater art and professional troupes. He said things like, "Art troupe members can only dance the yangge and beat the waist drum," "Art troupes need to be reorganized, personnel need to be greatly reduced, and formal troupes need to be established," "Let them (art troupe members) change jobs..." and other counter-revolutionary rhetoric.

At that time, the deputy director of the Cultural Department of the East China Administrative Committee and member of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, Peng Boshan, immediately issued orders to disband a large number of art troupes and transfer them to Shanghai, forming the East China People's Art Theatre (the affiliated drama troupe was later merged into the People's Art Theatre). On the other hand, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan hastily assembled a troupe that had long been under his direct leadership, the original Nationalist drama troupe, and gathered a number of "experts" and "authorities" from the old society, establishing the Shanghai People's Art Theatre. Xia Yan himself served as the director.

Revolutionary practice has proven that revolutionary art troupes are the best combat organizational form for serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art, and for serving proletarian politics with literature and art. However, the top capitalist-roader within the Party openly opposed Chairman Mao's directives, on the one hand, he slaughtered revolutionary art troupes, and on the other hand, he vigorously promoted the establishment of bourgeois theater art. His spearhead was directly aimed at our great leader Chairman Mao, crazily attacking Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, using "reorganization" as a cover, and carrying out restoration in reality! Under the cover of this "imperial decree," counter-revolutionary revisionists like Xia Yan and others were active, using a legal gold signboard to attract traitors, gathering notorious reactionary academic "authorities" like Qu Baiyin, holding black meetings, spreading poison, and talking about the "long-term plan" of theater art. They said things like, "We must establish an art theater that can perform classics like 'The Storm,'" "The Moscow Theater is our model of struggle." They hated the art troupes with good revolutionary traditions to death, maliciously slandering them as "rough," "street performances," "low-level goods," "vulgar," "anyone can be an art troupe member," "art troupes perform like people who can't act performing Japanese devils," and so on. Under the guise of establishing a theater, some reactionary literati transformed into "revolutionary cadres," and some even usurped important leadership positions in the theater. Zhou Yang and others vigorously promoted their "three excellences" and "three highs" policies, making bourgeois ideology rampant in literary and artistic organizations, with many people eager for foreign, famous, and ancient things, burying their heads in the classics of the 18th and 19th centuries, both Chinese and foreign, and calling it "accumulating creative materials." In this way, our theater began to walk the road of capitalist revisionism in politics, ideology, organization, and life.

III

In 1962, the heads of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line, Zhou Yang and Lin Mohan, in order to closely cooperate with their master, further create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, gathered the ghosts and snakes in the literary and artistic world and so-called "celebrities," "scholars," "experts," and "authorities," and held the "Guangzhou Conference." Our theater's ×××, following the orders of his master, threw out a patchwork of bourgeois, modern revisionist, and feudal theatrical theories at the conference. This long and stinking piece of work attempted to use the so-called philosophical nature of theater to replace the class nature of literature and art, to use the diversification of theatrical forms to oppose the policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art, and to bring socialist theater onto the revisionist track. This piece of work was favored by the then deputy director of the Central Propaganda Department, Hu ××, who immediately summoned this person and praised him highly. He also recommended him to their master. The top capitalist-roader within the Party soon personally summoned this person. During the meeting, he played a trick, first hypocritically advocating the writing of modern plays, then emphasizing the need to write more plays about the lives of miners, and then went on and on about examples of miners' struggles. Was he really supporting the writing of revolutionary modern plays? No; anyone with eyes can see that he was trying to use the cover of "revolutionary modern plays" to bring his past so-called "leadership in miners' struggles" onto the stage, to steal heaven's credit, and to build a monument for himself. He talked around the bush for a long time, and that was his purpose! Sure enough, soon the film "Spark" and related literary works came out one after another. It should be pointed out that at that time, his "Cultivation" was reprinted, directing the spearhead at our most red, most red red sun, Chairman Mao. He did this precisely to try to gain fame and fortune through theater, establish personal prestige, and achieve his evil goals of usurping the Party, usurping the government, and usurping the military!

This evil literary and artistic line and its boss—the top capitalist-roader within the Party—owe the Party and the people a mountain of debts. We are determined, in this great campaign of revolutionary criticism, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and with the revolutionary people of the whole country, to launch a magnificent mass criticism movement, with a fearless spirit, to thoroughly smash this black line, to fight down, fight down, and fight down the boss and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and to let the great Mao Zedong Thought shine forever on our literary and artistic front with boundless brilliance.

    揪出文艺黑线的总后台
    上海人民文工团革命派部分战士
    上海人民艺术剧院（现名上海人民文工团）建院十多年来，在一小撮反革命修正主义分子控制下，大量贩卖修正主义的文艺黑货，用洋人、死人统治我们社会主义的话剧舞台，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道，制造舆论准备。通过目前开展的革命的大批判，使我们清楚地看到了制定这条反革命修正主义文艺路线的，不是别人，正是周扬、夏衍一伙的总后台——中国的赫鲁晓夫。现在是到了彻底清算的时候了。
    一
    由于这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，一再顽固地对抗毛主席关于批判卖国主义影片《清宫秘史》的指示，并说它是什么“爱国主义”的，于是周扬、夏衍等反革命修正主义分子秉承他们的总后台的旨意，利用这部影片的流毒，在上海舞台上，为反动的戏剧大开绿灯。
    一九五七年，有个通俗话剧团演出了反动影片《清宫秘史》的翻版、通俗话剧《光绪与珍妃》，和污蔑义和团斗争的《张汶祥刺马》，立即得到了反革命修正主义分子田汉的赏识，大肆吹捧，极力推荐，并调往北京演出，以抬高其身价。一九六○年，又以挖掘传统，发展流派为名，把这个剧团塞进上海人艺这个黑据点。而《张汶祥刺马》，也就成了上海人艺方言话剧的“保留剧目”，前后上演达百余场之多，在观众中散布了大量的毒素。
    与此同时，另一反动话剧《清宫外史》的作者，也因排演田汉的大毒草《关汉卿》有功，而被拉进上海人艺。《清宫外史》是抗战期间问世的，和反动影片《清宫秘史》一样，也是歪曲历史事实，污蔑革命的群众运动，美化帝国主义、封建主义，宣扬资产阶级改良主义的货色。一九四二年在重庆首演时，曾博得中国最大的反动头子蒋介石的青睐，蒋看戏后破例召见作者，设宴招待，合影留念，成为当时剧坛上的一件臭名昭著的故实。毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”为什么蒋介石会如此重视这个戏呢？正是因为它宣扬了民族投降主义和阶级投降主义，为蒋匪帮出谋献策。为什么在一九六二年，陈荒煤之流，还迫不及待地要当年受到蒋介石特别赏识的那个家伙改编为电影，准备重新出笼？凡此种种，正是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派保护和吹捧了反动电影《清宫秘史》的结果，这是他们政治阴谋的大暴露。
    一九六二年，正是赫鲁晓夫狂热鼓吹“和平共处”路线，到处宣扬肯尼迪是个“明智”的总统时，我国党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和他唱同一个调子，再度抛出了他的黑《修养》，把矛头指向我们伟大的领袖毛主席，为资本主义复辟制造舆论，他那些嗅觉灵敏的干将立即纷纷响应，夏衍很快就下令给《清宫外史》的作者，要他按照党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的胃口，精心炮制出大毒草《忠王麾下》。剧本以一个被太平天国俘虏的英帝国主义分子为主角，通过他在大叛徒李秀成军中所经历的一段故事，力图证明帝国主义阵营中也有所谓“明智派”和“头脑比较清醒的人”，公开为帝国主义涂脂抹粉。
    三年自然灾害期间，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派又下达了另一个黑指示，那就是肆意诬蔑三面红旗，大力提倡“三自一包”，在国内煽起一股翻案、单干和自由化的歪风，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。文艺界的牛鬼蛇神马上积极配合，田汉首先抛出了他解放前的旧作——歌颂叛徒、污蔑工人阶级的《丽人行》，其他如《梁上君子》、《认钱不认人》、《金钱世界》、《啼笑姻缘》、《借妻》、《茶花女》、《冒失鬼》……等纷纷出笼，使上海的话剧舞台乌烟瘴气，群魔飞舞。
    二
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，公开反对毛主席的文艺路线，反对文艺为工农兵服务，对革命文艺队伍，怀有刻骨的阶级仇恨。解放初期，他给周扬等人下达了一个大砍大杀革命文工团（队）、建立苏修式的剧场艺术和专业剧团的黑指示。胡说什么：“文工团员就会扭扭秧歌，打打腰鼓”，“文工团要整编，人员要大大削减，建立正式的剧团”，“让他们（文工团员）转业……”等等反革命论调。
    当时的华东行政委员会文化部副部长、胡风反革命集团分子彭柏山，根据这一黑指示，立即下令撤销了大批文工团（队），并把他们调来上海，组成了华东人民艺术剧院
  （所属话剧团，后来也并入人艺）。另一方面，反革命修正主义分子夏衍，则匆忙拼凑起一支长期在他直接领导下的原国民党演剧队，搜罗了一些旧社会的“专家”、“权威”，成立了上海人民艺术剧院。夏衍自己亲自担任院长。
    革命的实践证明了革命的文工团（队）是文艺为工农兵服务，文艺为无产阶级政治服务的最好的战斗组织形式。而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却公然与毛主席的指示唱反调，一面大肆砍杀文工团（队），一面又竭力鼓吹建立资产阶级的剧场艺术，其矛头就是直接指向我们伟大的领袖毛主席，疯狂地攻击毛主席的文艺路线，反对毛泽东思想，借“整编”之名，行复辟之实！就在他这道“圣谕”的掩护下，反革命修正主义分子夏衍等人四出活动，为他们的招降纳叛打出一面合法的金字招牌，把一些臭名昭著的反动学术“权威”如瞿白音之流，纠集在一起，开黑会，放毒气，大谈其剧场艺术的“远景规划”。说什么：“我们一定要建立起一个能演《大雷雨》这样经典巨著的艺术剧院”，“莫斯科剧院才是我们的奋斗样板”。他们对富有优良革命传统的文工团（队）则恨得要死，恶毒污蔑为“粗糙！”是“草台班”、“低级货”、“庸俗”、“什么人都能当文工团员”、“文工团演戏就象不会演戏的人演日本鬼子一样”等等。在建立剧院的幌子下，一些反动文人竟然摇身一变成了“革命的干部”，有的人甚至还窃踞了剧院的领导要职。周扬等人又大力推行其“三名”主义、“三高”政策，使文艺团体中的资产阶级思想日益泛滥，不少人热衷于洋、名、古，埋头苦读十八、十九世纪的中外古典“名著”，而美其名曰：“积累创作素材”。就这样，我院开始从政治上、思想上、组织上、生活上各个方面走向了资本主义修正主义的道路。
    三  
    一九六二年，反革命修正主义文艺路线头目周扬、林默涵，为了与他们的总后台紧密配合，进一步制造资本主义复辟的舆论，搜罗文艺界的牛鬼蛇神和所谓“名流”、“学者”、“专家”、“权威”，召开了“广州会议”。我院的×××秉承其主子的旨意，在会上抛出了拼凑资产阶级、现代修正主义、封建主义等破烂的戏剧理论，这篇又臭又长的东西，企图用所谓戏剧的哲理性来代替文艺的阶级性，用戏剧形式的多样化来反对文艺为工农兵服务的方针，把社会主义的戏剧纳入修正主义的轨道。这个东西，受到了当时的中央宣传部常务副部长胡××的垂青，并急急召见这个人，对他倍加赞赏。还推荐给他们的总后台。这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派不久就亲自召见了这个人。在接见中，他还耍了一个阴谋，先假惺惺地提倡多写现代戏，然后就强调要多写反映矿工生活的戏，接着就哇里哇啦不厌其烦地大谈了一通矿工斗争的事例。他是真的要支持写革命现代戏吗？决不是；明眼人一看就知道，他是企图通过“革命现代戏”这个幌子，把他过去那所谓“领导矿工斗争”的历史搬上舞台，贪天之功，为他个人树碑立传。他转弯抹角谈了半天，目的就在于此！果然，不久后电影《燎原》和有关的文艺作品就相继出了笼。应该指出的是当时正是他的《修养》再版，把攻击的矛头指向我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的时候。他这样做，正是企图通过戏剧捞取名利，树立个人威信，以达到其篡党、篡政、篡军的罪恶目的！
    这条万恶的文艺路线和它的后台老板——党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，对党对人民欠下了累累罪债。我们决心在这场革命的大批判中，与广大工农兵一起，与全国革命人民一起，开展一场轰轰烈烈的群众性的批判运动，以大无畏的精神，彻底摧毁这条黑线，把它的后台老板及一小撮反革命修正主义分子斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，让伟大的毛泽东思想永远在我们的文艺阵地上放射出光焰无际的光芒。
