	NEW DELHI, April 20 -- According to reports released here on April 20: The military and civilians of Haiphong, the second-largest city in North Vietnam, shot down five invading American aggressor aircraft on April 20, giving the American aggressors, who were conducting a new "war escalation" operation, the punishment they deserved.

	On April 20, American aggressors again dispatched aircraft to conduct barbaric bombing and strafing of residential areas and industrial facilities in Haiphong city and its suburbs. The military and civilians of Haiphong, filled with deep hatred for the American aggressors, demonstrated a spirit of decisive battle and decisive victory, closely coordinated their actions, and fought exceptionally well, foiling the enemy's multiple attacks and achieving brilliant new victories. Preliminary reports indicate that five American aggressor aircraft were shot down and many more were damaged.

	Additionally, it was reported that the military and civilians of Nghe An and Quang Binh provinces shot down one American aircraft each on April 19. The militia of Xuan Yen County in Nghe An Province also shot down an American aircraft on March 31.

	NEW DELHI, April 21 -- The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on April 21 strongly condemning the American air pirates' barbaric attack on Haiphong on April 20 as a "war escalation" crime.

	The statement pointed out that on April 20, American aircraft dropped a large number of bombs on many factories and other industrial facilities in Haiphong city, as well as on densely populated residential areas on the outskirts of the city. Preliminary reports indicate that more than 100 innocent people were injured or killed, and many houses were destroyed.

	The statement said that recently, the United States has continuously bombed and strafed industrial cities such as Thanh Hoa and Vinh, and now it has attacked an industrial metropolis of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—Haiphong. It is clear that the United States has carried out another extremely serious new "war escalation."

	The statement pointed out that the American aggressors believe that by conducting barbaric bombing, they can subdue the Vietnamese people and rescue their situation in South Vietnam, which is deeply mired in the quagmire. However, the more frantically they conduct "war escalation," the more they will be hated by the Vietnamese people, who are determined to give them the punishment they deserve.

	The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns the above-mentioned new "war escalation" actions by the U.S. government. The U.S. government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from its heinous and criminal acts of aggression in Vietnam.

	The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam appeals to the governments and peoples of countries that love peace and uphold justice to strongly condemn the U.S. aggression against Vietnam and to take timely action to stop the war crimes of the U.S. war criminals.

	The statement finally said that to defend the independence and freedom of the motherland and to fulfill the obligations undertaken to the peoples who are resisting U.S. imperialism, the Vietnamese people are determined to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

	NEW DELHI, April 20 -- According to reports released here: On April 19, the People's Air Force of Vietnam shot down two invading American aggressor aircraft over Thua Thien Province. That afternoon, American aggressor aircraft invaded the airspace over Thua Thien Province. The People's Air Force of Vietnam quickly intercepted the invading aircraft and shot down one American jet aircraft on the spot. The American air pirate who parachuted to escape was captured by the military and civilians of Thua Thien Province. The remaining enemy aircraft scattered and fled. Subsequently, American aggressor aircraft invaded again, attempting to rescue the parachuting American air pirate. The People's Air Force of Vietnam, undaunted, struck again with accurate firepower and shot down another enemy aircraft.
