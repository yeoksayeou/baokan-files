A Vietnamese artist recently wrote a letter to Chinese friends, enthusiastically praising Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. The letter stated that Chairman Mao "creatively and brilliantly inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism."

The artist, speaking on behalf of his entire family, expressed his sincere wishes: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! May the proletarian cultural revolution achieve great success under his leadership."

The letter, written in poetic language, praised the great leader Chairman Mao:

	"I gaze at the photograph of the magnificent Tiananmen Square,
	The radiant sun of the East—Mao Zedong Thought,
	Like an eternal spring, forever shining brilliantly,
	Bringing light to millions of people and the entire human world,
	It makes the sunflowers bloom,
	It awakens all those who are still asleep."

The letter said, "The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has opened a new era. It shines like the sun in the East, dispersing the dark clouds that have long shrouded the world. 'It will root out all the ghosts and monsters hiding under religious robes in every corner and will bring new souls to the working class, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals.'"

The letter mentioned that whenever he saw photographs, books, and films introduced by the Chinese people about Vietnam, he was deeply moved, "expressing his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people for their selfless internationalist support for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression, and hating even more those traitors who willingly serve as the running dogs of American imperialism, plotting to permanently divide Vietnamese territory."

The letter also expressed unwavering confidence in Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, stating, "We will resolutely follow Chairman Ho's teachings: We are determined to defeat the American aggressors."

    文化大革命开辟了历史的新纪元
    新华社河内电　越南一位画家最近写信给中国朋友，热烈赞扬毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命。信中说，毛主席“创造性地、天才地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义”。
    这位画家热情洋溢地代表全家，“敬祝伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆，领导无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大的成功。”
    信中用诗一样的语言，歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席说：
      “我凝视着雄伟的天安门广场的照片，
    东方灿烂的太阳——毛泽东思想，
    象不朽的春天永远光耀夺目，
    给千百万人民和整个人类世界带来光明，
    她使向阳花盛开，
    她使所有正在沉睡的人们觉醒。”
    信中说，中国“无产阶级文化大革命开辟了一个新纪元。它象东方的太阳光芒四射，驱散长时期来笼罩着世间的乌云。”“它将在每一个角落揪出一切披着袈裟的牛鬼蛇神，并将给工农阶级、革命干部和革命知识分子带来新的灵魂。”
    信中谈到他每当看到中国人民介绍越南的照片、书报和电影时，就无限地感动，“非常感谢中国人民对越南人民抗美救国战争的崇高的无私的国际主义支持，并更加仇恨甘心为阴谋长期分裂越南国土的美帝国主义当走狗的卖国贼。”
    信中还表达了对胡志明主席、越南劳动党、越南南方民族解放阵线的无限信心，表示“要坚决遵照胡主席的教导：决心战胜美国侵略强盗。”
