The General Secretary of the National Liberation Front of South Yemen, Makawi, stated at a press conference held in Cairo on the 11th that the failure of the "United Nations delegation" in Aden clearly shows that imperialism and its lackeys are facing annihilation. The brave revolutionary people of South Yemen are invincible against the British imperialist army and cannot be deceived by any of the enemy's plots. He said, "The people of South Yemen cannot accept an incomplete solution, nor are they prepared to compromise with our enemies."

In response to a reporter's question about whether there are any other means besides armed struggle, he firmly stated: "There are none." He said, "Now we realize that armed struggle is the only way." He pointed out: "As long as the British remain in South Yemen, we will strengthen our armed struggle. We are confident that the final victory will be ours."

The people of South Yemen are determined to fight to the end for national independence. They set fires in the streets, angrily opposing the "United Nations delegation," a tool of American and British imperialist aggression.

    南也门解放阵线总书记重申要打到底
    加强武装斗争夺取最后胜利
    据新华社开罗十一日电　被占领的南也门解放阵线总书记马卡维十一日在这里举行的记者招待会上说，“联合国代表团”在亚丁的失败清楚地表明，帝国主义及其走狗面临着灭亡。英勇的南也门革命人民，是英帝国主义的军队征服不了的，是敌人的任何阴谋欺骗不了的。他说：“南也门人民不能接受不彻底的解决办法，也不准备同我们的敌人妥协。”
    他在回答记者问除了武装斗争，是否还有别的途径时肯定地说：没有。他说：“现在我们认识到，武装斗争是唯一的途径。”他指出：只要英国赖在南也门不走，我们就要加强武装斗争，我们确信，最后胜利是属于我们的。
