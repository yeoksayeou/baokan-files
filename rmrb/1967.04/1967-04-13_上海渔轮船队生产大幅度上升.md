With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, the workers of the Shanghai fishing fleet have eliminated the rifts created by the bourgeois reactionary line among the masses and between the masses and cadres, strengthened unity, and increased their catch by more than half in the past half month compared to the previous half month.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 12—Under the powerful support of the People's Liberation Army, the production of the Shanghai Marine Fisheries Company's fishing fleet has significantly increased. The catch in the past half month has increased by more than half compared to the previous half month.

The evil bourgeois reactionary line, which created rifts between the masses and cadres, was the result of a handful of power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road and spread the counter-revolutionary wind of economism. This once affected the production of this powerful fishing fleet. The "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in Factories and Mines Across the Country" brought the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao, greatly inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm of the fishery workers to "grasp revolution and promote production." The East China Fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy, in accordance with the Party Central Committee's decision to strongly support local industrial production, sent a batch of cadres and soldiers to the fishing fleet, greatly encouraging the fishery workers. After the PLA comrades arrived at the fleet, they joined the broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in wielding the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to jointly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly eliminating its poison; in their work, they put political work in the first place, and together with the workers, repeatedly studied the "Three Articles" and the series of important articles recently published in the "Red Flag" magazine, rapidly improving the workers' revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, and greatly strengthening the revolutionary unity among the masses and between the masses and cadres. The workers expressed that they would use outstanding revolutionary and production achievements to thoroughly smash the evil plot of the number one power-holder within the Party who took the capitalist road to attempt a capitalist restoration in China.

Chairman Mao said: "What is work? Work is struggle.... The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. This is what a good comrade should do." In the arduous fishing battles, these teachings of Chairman Mao forever inspire the workers to forge ahead bravely. The sea is cold in spring, and the wind often rises. To catch more fish, the workers have been continuously fighting against the wind and waves, and even in nine-level winds and waves, they insist on working at sea. The Su North Great Sand fishing ground is a famous wind and wave area with no shelter from the wind, but the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers of the fleet all voluntarily requested to come here to show their skills. The eighteen pairs of fishing boats working here fought in eight to nine-level winds and waves, averaging five to six nets per day, with some reaching seven nets.

After the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres strengthened their unity, a moving scene emerged in fishing operations where everyone, regardless of affiliation, cooperated and competed to do things that were beneficial to grasping the revolution and promoting production. The day before the 284th ship set sail, the engine had a problem. If it was not repaired quickly, the ship would have to delay its departure. The comrades from the 371st ship, upon hearing this, immediately went to help the 284th ship's personnel with the repair. They worked from morning until ten o'clock at night, only leaving after the repair was completed, ensuring that the 284th ship set sail as planned.

    加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性
    上海渔轮船队生产大幅度上升
    在解放军的大力帮助下，职工们消除了资产阶级反动路线在群众之间、干群之间制造的隔阂，加强了团结，近半月的捕鱼量较前半月增长一半多
    据新华社上海十二日电　在人民解放军的有力支持下，上海海洋渔业公司渔轮船队生产大幅度上升，最近半月的捕鱼量比前半月增长一半以上。
    罪恶的资产阶级反动路线在群众与群众之间、群众与干部之间制造的隔阂，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大刮反革命经济主义妖风的结果，曾经使这支力量强大的渔轮船队生产一度受到影响。《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席的声音，极大地鼓舞了渔业职工“抓革命，促生产”的革命积极性；人民解放军海军东海舰队遵照党中央关于军队大力支持地方工业生产工作的决定，派出一批干部、战士来到渔轮船队，给了渔业职工很大鼓舞。解放军同志到了船队以后，同广大革命职工、革命干部一起，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，共同批判资产阶级反动路线，彻底肃清它的流毒；在工作中把政治工作放在首位，同职工一道反复学习“老三篇”，学习《红旗》杂志最近发表的一系列重要文章，迅速提高了职工们的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，大大加强了群众之间、群众和干部之间的革命团结。职工们纷纷表示，要用出色的革命和生产的成绩，彻底粉碎党内头号走资本主义道路当权派妄图在中国实现资本主义复辟的罪恶阴谋。
    毛主席说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。……越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”在艰巨的捕鱼战斗中，毛主席的这些教导永远鼓舞着职工们奋勇前进。海上春寒，大风时起。为了多捕鱼，职工们同风浪、晕船作了连续的斗争，有的甚至在九级风浪中坚持海上作业。苏北大沙渔场是有名的风浪区，又无避风锚地，但是船队的革命干部和革命职工都纷纷主动要求到这里来大显身手。在这里捕鱼的十八对渔船，奋战在八至九级的大风浪中，每天平均投五到六网，有的高达七网。
    革命群众与革命干部增进团结以后，在捕鱼作业中出现了不分你我，互相协作，有利于抓革命、促生产的事大家争着干的动人局面。二八四轮在出海的前一天，机器出了毛病，如不迅速修好，就要推迟出海。三七一轮的同志知道后，立即前往帮助二八四轮的人员检修。他们从上午修到晚上十点钟，直到修好才离开，保证了二八四轮按预订计划出海。
