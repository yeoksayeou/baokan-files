When I came to China, I had no idea what Mao Zedong Thought was. I knew nothing about the line, policies, and principles of the Chinese Communist Party, because they were so different from those of the American Communist Party. It took me considerable time to change my thinking and understand what true Marxism-Leninism is and what false Marxism-Leninism is. I came to realize that the Chinese Communist Party is a genuine Marxist-Leninist revolutionary party.

I have great respect for Chairman Mao. When I was young, I worked in a textile factory. Our union meetings were held in a room on the second floor of a store, a dilapidated place with only one picture on the wall—Chairman Mao. At that time, I already knew there was a Mao Zedong and that Mao Zedong was China's Lenin.

I remember that after I went to Yan'an, Chairman Mao talked to me several times. Each time the conversation was brief, but the impression was deep. Because after each conversation, I would always think, why did Chairman Mao say this, why is it different from what I originally thought? During the War of Liberation, I began to have such thoughts: to solve the problem of the American revolution, the answer lies in the cave dwellings and earthen houses of China. Although the actual situation in America is very different from that in China, I felt that the American revolution should follow the path indicated by Mao Zedong Thought.

Last June, I returned to Yan'an and during a discussion with some old comrades and young people there, I mentioned that previously, the Party in the South was small but very strong. Party members in the South who joined the revolution almost all suffered beatings, imprisonment, and oppression. The organization never disintegrated and was able to continue and develop. The persecution by the Ku Klux Klan did not destroy it; the government's suppression did not destroy it; the sabotage of some infiltrated spies did not destroy it. But later, the Party and its mass organizations were suddenly destroyed. This was after the American Communist Party became revisionist and issued orders for us to disband ourselves. After I came to China, whenever I thought of this, I felt very indignant. Our Party was not crushed from the outside by imperialism, but was destroyed from within by the enemy who fostered revisionism. At that time, we did not know how to oppose servility, did not know how to distinguish between the blind discipline of the bourgeoisie and the conscious discipline of the proletariat, and did not know how to rebel, so of course we could not withstand this revisionist counter-revolutionary current. How to find a fundamental way to prevent revisionism within the Party? I never found a clear answer. During the War of Liberation and just after liberation, I began to form the idea that Mao Zedong Thought and the truths of Marxism-Leninism should be combined with the revolutionary practice of one's own country. In this way, revisionism can be prevented, and even if revisionism arises, it can be overcome and defeated. At that time, it can be said that I only had a theoretical awareness of this problem. But in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have a further understanding of this problem, not only in theory but also in practice.

The Cultural Revolution has made me feel reborn, twenty years younger. The Cultural Revolution has found a way to prevent and oppose revisionism. I feel that China has such Red Guards, such revolutionary youth nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, the future of the world revolution can be completely reassured. The Chinese Cultural Revolution has decisive significance for the world revolution.

The current world situation is that the working people and all peace-loving people are on one side, and the most vicious enemies of humanity, American imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, are on the other side, engaged in a global class struggle. In other words, this is a global class war. American imperialism wants to dominate the globe and suppress revolutionary movements everywhere. The Soviet revisionist leadership, as an ally of American imperialism, openly suppresses revolutionary masses, betrays revolutionary masses, and serves American imperialism. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China has dealt a devastating blow to imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China has further brought to the forefront of the world revolutionary people the issues of the leader of the world revolution, the guiding ideology of the world revolution, and the center of the world revolution. In this way, the world's proletarian revolutionaries have a clear direction, which is the key to the success or failure of the revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China has opened a new chapter in the world revolution.

I feel that the most serious blow that Khrushchev revisionism has dealt to the world revolution is the so-called opposition to the cult of personality. Khrushchev's criminal act has caused enormous damage to the world revolution. If this counter-revolutionary current is not repulsed, the revolution cannot advance, let alone be victorious. To deny the revolutionary leader of the proletariat is actually to affirm the leader of the bourgeoisie. American blacks have risen to fight, and they can see this very clearly. I have seen some of their mimeographed leaflets, which are very politically sensitive, and they shout: "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" American blacks are at the bottom of American society, with the highest class consciousness, and with national oppression, they are even more sensitive. Their starting point is very simple: the American empire is the most vicious enemy, and it most opposes Mao Zedong, so Mao Zedong must be the most correct. So they desperately look for Mao Zedong's books, and when they read them, they feel very close, as if they were written for them, pointing out the way for them. Who is their leader, their teacher, they are very clear in their hearts. They start from the fundamental point of Mao Zedong Thought: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." They shout from the bottom of their hearts: "Long live Mao Zedong!" A foreign friend from Beijing went to the United States and participated in a debate. The topic of the debate was: How do you view the statement that Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world? A black youth stood up and said: "You can debate many theoretical issues that I don't understand, but for me, there is nothing to debate. In my heart, Mao Zedong is the reddest red sun!"

Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, a great genius of the world revolution of our time, and the greatest banner of the revolution of our time. The Cultural Revolution fully proves that following Chairman Mao's instructions, the revolution advances; departing from Chairman Mao's instructions, the revolution fails. This is true for China, and it is also true for the revolutionary forces of the world. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the only correct Marxism-Leninism that guides the revolution to victory.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China has more clearly resolved for the revolutionary people of the world the major issues of the leader of the world revolution, the guiding ideology of the world revolution, and the center of the world revolution, which is the most fundamental contribution to the world revolution. The genuine proletarian revolutionaries of various countries in the world, holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of Chairman Mao as the leader of the world revolution, bravely advance despite the various persecutions of the reactionaries. They have unlimited love for Mao Zedong Thought and make greater and greater contributions to the revolution of their own countries.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China has solved a very important problem for the proletarian revolution of our time, that is, after the proletariat has seized power, how to prevent the restoration of capitalism, how to consolidate and develop the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system, and how to open the path to communism. After this problem is solved, the revolutionary movement of the whole world will open up a new situation and enter a new stage, that is, imperialism will be overthrown in the whole world, and the cause of socialism and communism will achieve victory in the whole world.

In 1871, the Paris Commune had the experience of the proletariat seizing power. In 1917, the October Revolution of Russia developed this experience. As for how to consolidate and develop the power, the past experience was only to resist external armed attacks and carry out internal wars to maintain the power.

But there is a problem that has not been solved, that is, after the proletariat seizes power, how not to produce revisionism, how not to allow the restoration of capitalism, how to develop the proletarian power, how to carry the revolution to the end, how to continue to develop the already victorious socialist country, how to develop the proletarian revolution and become the base of the world revolution, how to defend the proletarian revolution. This major problem has not been solved in the past, and it has only been clearly solved in this Cultural Revolution. After the proletariat seizes power, it must continue to rebel against the bourgeoisie, rebel against revisionism, and rebel against all ideological forms of the exploiting classes. It must smash the bourgeois worldview and arm the broad masses with the proletarian worldview. The proletariat seizing power by force is a universal law. After seizing power, how to mobilize the broad masses of the people from below to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sweep away bourgeois ideology, and carry out the second seizure of power, this is also a universal law, but it was not known before. Now it is not only known in theory, but also has practical experience.

After seizing power, it is necessary to continue to seize the power of bourgeois ideology in the mind, otherwise the old world cannot be thoroughly smashed, and the new world cannot be established.

The book "Cultivation" is very harmful. I myself have suffered greatly, and it would take days and nights to denounce it. "Cultivation" is a poisonous weed that cultivates you to be a slave. If you follow his "Cultivation" and do not resist, you can rise up, and if you make a mistake, you can cover it up and get away with it. This book also advocates "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," that is, cultivating yourself for personal gain, for the benefit of a small clique, which is pure bourgeois exploitation ideology.

"Cultivation" is completely contrary to Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao advocates establishing a proletarian worldview, establishing the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly, being selfless, and benefiting others, and using the thought of serving the people to test a person's performance in the struggle.

In the past, we all trusted the Soviet Union, and when we saw the red five-pointed star on the Kremlin, we felt hopeful. Later, this light went out. We thought that the Chinese revolution had vitality and was still supporting the revolutionary forces of various countries. But what guarantee is there that it will not change? Comrades from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as soon as they come to China, raise this question. In 1963, Chairman Mao issued a statement supporting the struggle of American blacks and at the same time received two Americans and a delegation from 18 African countries. A representative from Cameroon stood up and said: "There is a sentence we dare not say, but we were entrusted by the armed struggle youth to ask, what guarantee is there that China supports us today and will support us tomorrow?" The Cultural Revolution has clearly answered this question. The Cultural Revolution has made socialist China forever young and revolutionary, determined to carry the revolution to the end. Through the Cultural Revolution, we can now draw such a conclusion: the question of whether China will change or not is no longer a concern. The broad revolutionary youth and revolutionary masses of China who have been tempered by class struggles are the guarantee, and Mao Zedong Thought is the guarantee.

The Chinese revolution will definitely carry the world revolution to the end. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China has reopened the path to communism that was blocked by Khrushchev revisionism.

The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. The spirit of "five dares" is to put the idea that all reactionaries are paper tigers and the strategic idea of despising imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries into practical action. Knowing that they are paper tigers, what should be done? One must have the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to venture, and dare to rebel. The "five dares" spirit and the idea that revolutionary rebellion is justified have been put in the first place in the Cultural Revolution. Handing over the idea that revolutionary rebellion is justified to the revolutionary forces of various countries will have great significance in promoting the world revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China is also political and all-around support for the proletarian revolutionaries of the world. This has made the imperialist-revisionist-reactionaries very afraid. A spy journalist named Durden, who studies Chinese issues for The New York Times, wrote an article in the early days of the Cultural Revolution saying that in the past, hopes were placed on Mao Zedong's second generation, but now it seems that this second generation may be even more formidable than the first.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China has provided strategies and tactics for preventing and opposing revisionism, and it is a large-scale exercise in preventing and opposing revisionism. The Soviet revisionist leadership is very aware of this. They have been causing trouble, especially since the "January Revolution" in Shanghai, the Soviet revisionists have come out in the open. Kosygin cursed China in front of the British Queen, cursed China's Cultural Revolution, and even publicly begged imperialism for recognition, assistance, and threw away all face. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China has stirred the hearts of revolutionary people and also the hearts of the Soviet people. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China has exposed the true colors of the Soviet revisionists. The Soviet revisionists are terrified and are spreading rumors, saying that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China is not proletarian, not cultural, not revolutionary, and even counter-revolutionary. This is sheer nonsense. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique curses China more fiercely than the imperialists do, because they are very guilty. They are particularly afraid of overthrowing servility! They are afraid of overthrowing the party's power-holders who are taking the capitalist road and the resounding slogan of the proletarian revolution's rebellion is justified! The Chinese people, in the Cultural Revolution, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao has become the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world. The days of the Soviet revisionists are getting worse and worse. The Mr. Revisionist is shouting and screaming that the Cultural Revolution is sinister. This intention can be admitted, that is, it is determined to uproot revisionism in China. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China has enhanced the fighting spirit and confidence of the people of the revisionist countries. The people of these countries will definitely rise up and carry out revolutionary rebellions in ways suitable to their needs.

Why did Durden write such an article? Why, when discussing the Vietnam issue, is it often linked to China's Cultural Revolution? Because the reactionary nature of the imperialist class has made it pay attention to China's Cultural Revolution. The Cultural Revolution has blocked the road of "peaceful evolution" that the imperialist-revisionists intended to take in China, which is a heavy blow to the global strategy of the United States and a powerful support for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. The great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China are inspiring the revolutionary people of the world. The increasingly powerful China, which has become a base for the world revolution, has greatly enhanced the fighting confidence of the revolutionary people of the world. Comrade Strong's thoughts are now very active. She said: "I am already 81 years old, but I can still do revolutionary propaganda work, and I can still see many things. Perhaps the things I can see about the Chinese revolution and the world revolution may be much more than I originally imagined! This 81-year-old old revolutionary still has a lot to look forward to!" I feel that she has such a feeling, and many young people from abroad should have this feeling.

Since the Cultural Revolution, I have indeed changed in many ways. My thoughts have changed, and some of my deeply rooted living habits have also begun to change. How did I change? It is because I have the red sun in my heart. I have studied Mao Zedong Thought, and I have further realized that Chairman Mao is a great revolutionary leader and a great teacher. I have gained a new strength. I deeply feel that a person with Mao Zedong Thought in his heart, with the red sun in his heart, can break through his original thoughts, can transcend his original scope, and become a very powerful member of the collective, fully exerting his light and heat to participate in the revolutionary cause. The Red Guards are not born brave, but because they have the red sun in their hearts, they are brave.

Chairman Mao is not only the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people, but also the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world. The revolutionary people of the world will forever follow the red sun and will definitely carry the world revolution to the end!

### 中国文化大革命打开了通向共产主义的航道

    中国文化大革命打开了通向共产主义的航道
    美国　李敦白
    一
  　我到中国来的时候，根本不知道什么叫毛泽东思想。当时我对毛泽东思想，对中国共产党的路线、方针、政策都不了解，因为这些与美国共产党的一套太不相同了。经过相当时间，我的脑子才转过来，认识到什么是真马列主义，什么是假马列主义。我认识到中国共产党是真正的马克思列宁主义的革命党。
    我对毛主席是非常尊敬的。我年青时候在一家纺织厂工作。我们工会开会是在一个商店的楼上，是一间破破烂烂的房子，墙上只挂着一张相片，就是毛主席。那时候，我已经知道有一个毛泽东，也知道毛泽东是中国的列宁。
    我记得到延安以后，毛主席跟我谈过几次话。每次谈话的时间不长，但是留下的印象很深。因为在每次谈话以后，我总是思考，毛主席为什么这么提，为什么同我脑子里原来的想法不一样。解放战争时期，我就开始有这样的想法：要解决美国革命问题，答案就在中国的土窑洞和土平房里。虽然美国的实际情况与中国很不相同，但是我感到美国的革命，应该走毛泽东思想所指引的道路。
    去年六月，我又到了延安，同那里的一些老同志和青年座谈时讲到，以前，美共在南方的党，很小，但很坚强。南方党员入党搞革命，几乎每个人都挨过打，坐过牢，受过压迫。组织从来没有瓦解，能坚持下去，有一定的发展。三K党的迫害，没有能消灭它；政府的镇压，没有能消灭它；派进去的一些特务的破坏，也没有能消灭它。但是后来党和它的群众组织一下子消灭了。这是美共变成了修正主义以后，下命令要我们自己动手解散的。我到中国以后，每当回想起这些，心里就很气愤。我们的党，不是帝国主义从外面把它压垮的，而是敌人在我们内部培养修正主义，从内部把它搞垮的。那时我们不懂得反对奴隶主义，不懂得如何区别资产阶级盲目的纪律和无产阶级自觉的纪律，也不懂得造反，当然也就没有顶住这股修正主义的反革命逆流。怎样找一个防止党内出修正主义的根本办法呢？我一直找不到一个明确的答案。在解放战争时期和刚解放以后，我开始形成一个想法，就是要把毛泽东思想，要把马列主义真理，与自己国家的革命实践相结合，这样，就可以防止出修正主义，就是出了修正主义，也能够战胜它，打倒它。在当时可以说只是在理论上意识到了这个问题。而在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我对这个问题不仅在理论上，而且在实践上又有了进一步的认识。
    文化大革命使我感到了新生，年轻了二十岁。文化大革命为怎样防止和反对修正主义找到了道路。我感到中国有这样的红卫兵小将，有这样在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的革命青少年，世界革命的前途是完全可以放心的。中国的文化大革命对世界革命是具有决定性意义的。
    二
    现在的世界局势，就是劳动人民和一切爱好自由的人民为一边，人类最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义和各国反动派为一边，进行全球的阶级斗争，可以说，这是一场全球性的阶级战争。美帝国主义要霸占全球，到处镇压革命运动。苏修领导集团作为美帝的盟友，公开出来压制革命群众，出卖革命群众，替美帝国主义效劳。中国无产阶级文化大革命，给了帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派以毁灭性的打击。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命，进一步地把世界革命的领袖、世界革命的指导思想、世界革命的中心这些问题突出地摆在全世界革命人民的面前。这样，全世界的无产阶级革命派就有了明确的方向，这是革命成败的关键所在。中国无产阶级文化大革命开辟了世界革命新的一页。
    我觉得赫鲁晓夫修正主义对世界革命的一个严重打击，就是所谓反对个人迷信。赫鲁晓夫的这个罪恶行动，对世界革命造成的损失是巨大的。如果不打退这股反革命逆流，革命就不能前进，更不能胜利。否定无产阶级的革命领袖，实际上就肯定了资产阶级的领袖。美国黑人起来战斗，他们是很能看清这一点的。我看到他们的一些油印小报，政治上很敏感，就是喊：“毛泽东！毛泽东！毛泽东！”美国黑人处在美国社会的最下层，阶级觉悟最高，再加上民族压迫，就更敏感。他们的出发点很简单，美帝是最凶恶的敌人，它最反对毛泽东，那么毛泽东一定是最正确的。于是他们就拚命去找毛泽东的书，一看，就感到很亲切，觉得就是给他们自己写的，给他们指出了道路。谁是他们的领袖、他们的导师，他们心里非常明白。他们就是从毛泽东思想根本的一条出发：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”他们从心底喊出：“毛泽东万岁！”北京的一位外国朋友到美国去，参加了一个辩论会。辩论的问题是，毛主席是全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳，这句话怎么看？一个黑人青年站起来说：“你们在理论上辩论很多问题我不了解，但是对我来讲，没有什么可辩的。在我心中，毛泽东就是最红最红的红太阳！”
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是当代世界革命的伟大天才，是当代革命最伟大的旗手。文化大革命充分证明，照毛主席指示去做，革命就前进，离开了毛主席指示，革命就失败。对中国是这样，对全世界革命派也是这样。毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是唯一正确的指导革命、引向胜利的马列主义。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命，在世界革命人民的心目中更加明确地解决了世界革命的领袖、世界革命的指导思想、世界革命的中心等重大问题，这是对世界革命的一个最根本的贡献。世界各国真正的无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想旗帜，高举毛主席是全世界革命领袖的旗帜，不顾反动派的种种迫害，大胆前进。他们对毛泽东思想无限热爱，对本国的革命作出越来越大的贡献。
    三
  　中国无产阶级文化大革命解决了当代无产阶级革命的一个极为重大的问题，就是在无产阶级夺取了政权以后，怎样防止资本主义复辟，怎样巩固和发展无产阶级专政和社会主义制度以及怎样打开通向共产主义的道路的问题。这个问题解决以后，就会使全世界革命运动打开新的局面，开始新的阶段，就是说帝国主义要在全世界被打垮，社会主义、共产主义事业要在全世界取得胜利。
    一八七一年巴黎公社有了无产阶级夺取政权的经验。一九一七年俄国十月革命发展了这个经验。怎样巩固和发展政权，这方面过去有过的经验，只是抵抗外部武装进攻和进行内部战争来维护政权。
    但是，有一个问题没有解决，就是无产阶级掌握政权以后，如何不出修正主义，如何不让资本主义复辟，如何把无产阶级政权发展下去，把革命进行到底，怎样把已经胜利的社会主义国家继续发展下去，把无产阶级革命发展下去，成为世界革命的基地，保卫无产阶级革命，这个重大问题过去没有解决，这次文化大革命才得到明确的解决。无产阶级在夺取政权以后，还要继续造资产阶级的反，造修正主义的反，造一切剥削阶级意识形态的反，破资产阶级世界观，用无产阶级世界观武装广大群众。无产阶级用武力夺取政权是普遍规律。夺权以后，如何自下而上地发动广大人民群众开展无产阶级文化大革命，扫除资产阶级思想，进行第二次夺权，这也是普遍规律，但以前根本不知道。现在不但是在理论上已经知道，而且在实践上也有了经验。
    夺取政权以后，必须继续夺头脑中资产阶级思想的权，否则旧世界不能破得彻底，新世界创立不起来。
    《修养》这本书危害很大。我自己受害之大，控诉几天几夜也说不完。《修养》是大毒草，培养你当奴隶，如果你按着他的《修养》去做，不反抗，你就能往上爬，万一犯了错误，遮遮掩掩，也能过去。这本书还提倡“吃小亏占大便宜”，就是自己“修养”好，是为了个人有好处，对小集团有好处，这是十足的资产阶级剥削思想。
    《修养》是完全违反毛泽东思想的。毛主席提倡树立无产阶级世界观，树立彻底为人民服务的思想，毫不利己，专门利人，用为人民服务的思想来考验一个人在斗争中的表现。
    过去我们都很信任苏联，看着克里姆林宫上面的红五角星，就觉得有了希望。后来这个灯灭了。我们就想，中国革命有朝气，现在还在支持各国革命派。但是有什么把握可以保证不变？亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲同志，一到中国都提出这个问题。一九六三年，毛主席发表了支持美国黑人斗争的声明，同时还接待了我们两个美国人和十八个非洲国家的代表团。喀麦隆一个代表站起来说：“有一句话，我们不好意思讲，但是我们受武装斗争青年的委托，让我们问，有什么把握证明中国今天支持我们，明天是不是还支持我们？”文化大革命清楚地回答了这个问题。文化大革命使社会主义中国永葆革命青春，誓把革命进行到底。通过文化大革命，现在可以得出这样一个结论：中国变不变的问题，用不着担心了。经过阶级斗争风浪锻炼的广大中国革命青年和革命群众就是保证，毛泽东思想就是保证。
    中国革命进行到底，就一定会把世界革命进行到底。中国的无产阶级文化大革命重新打开了被赫鲁晓夫修正主义阻塞的通向共产主义的航道。
    四
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利沉重地打击了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。“五敢”精神是把一切反动派都是纸老虎的思想，和战略上藐视帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派的思想贯彻到实际行动中去。知道了是纸老虎，应该怎么办？就要有敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的“五敢”精神，中国的文化大革命做出了样板，英勇的红卫兵小将提供了榜样。在文化大革命中，把“五敢”精神，革命造反有理的思想，提到了第一位。把革命造反有理的思想交给各国革命派，这对促进世界革命将有巨大的意义。
    中国的文化大革命也是对全世界无产阶级革命派政治上和各方面的支援。这使帝修反非常害怕。《纽约时报》的一个叫杜尔敦的、研究中国问题的特务记者，在文化大革命初期，就在报上写过一篇报道说，过去把希望寄托在毛泽东的第二代，现在看来这第二代可能比第一代还要厉害。
    中国的文化大革命提供了防修反修的战略和策略，是防修反修的大演习。苏修领导集团非常了解这一点。他们拚命捣乱，特别是从上海的“一月革命”开始，苏修豁出来了。柯西金到英国女王面前骂中国，骂中国的文化大革命，竟然公开乞求帝国主义赏识他，援助他，一切面子都不要了。中国的文化大革命激动了革命人民的心，也激动了苏联人民的心。中国的文化大革命把苏修的老底揭露出来了。苏修怕得要死，于是大造谣言，他们胡说什么中国无产阶级文化大革命不是无产阶级的，不是文化的，不革命的，甚至是反革命的。这简直是胡说八道。苏修统治集团骂中国比帝国主义骂的还凶，因为它心虚得很。它尤其怕打倒奴隶主义！怕打倒党内走资本主义道路的当权派和无产阶级革命造反有理的响亮口号！中国人民在文化大革命中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，毛主席成了世界革命人民心中的红太阳。苏修的日子越来越不好过了。修字号的先生大叫大嚷说，文化大革命是别有用心的。这个用心是可以承认的，就是决心在中国挖掉修正主义的根子。中国文化大革命增强了修正主义国家人民的斗争勇气和信心。这些国家的人民一定会起来用适合他们需要的办法进行革命造反。
    为什么杜尔敦写这样的文章？为什么一谈越南问题，往往就联系到中国的文化大革命？因为帝国主义的反动阶级本质引起它注意中国的文化大革命。文化大革命堵住了帝修妄图在中国搞“和平演变”的道路，对美国的全球战略是个沉重的打击，对各国人民革命斗争是有力的支援。中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就鼓舞着世界革命人民。成为世界革命基地的中国的日益强大，也大大增强了世界革命人民的斗争信心。斯特朗同志现在的思想非常活跃，她说：“我这人已经八十一岁，但是还能干革命宣传工作，还能看许多东西，大概我能看得到的中国革命、世界革命的事情，比我原来设想的可能多得多！我这个八十一岁的老革命还是很有奔头！”我觉得她有这种感觉，外国的许多青年更应该有这个感觉。
    文化大革命以来，我在许多方面确实变了。我的思想变了，我的一些根深蒂固的生活习惯，也开始变了。怎么变的？就是因为心中有红太阳。我学习了毛泽东思想，我进一步认识到毛主席是伟大的革命领袖和伟大的导师，我就有了一种新的力量。我深深地感到，一个人有了毛泽东思想，心里有了红太阳，他就可以打破自己原来的思想，可以超脱原来的范围，成为大集体中十分有力量的一员，发挥自己全部的光和热来参加革命事业。红卫兵小将们不是生来就勇敢的，而是因为他们心里有了红太阳，所以勇敢。
    毛主席不仅是中国人民心中的红太阳，也是全世界革命人民心中的红太阳。全世界革命人民永远跟着红太阳，一定会把世界革命进行到底！
