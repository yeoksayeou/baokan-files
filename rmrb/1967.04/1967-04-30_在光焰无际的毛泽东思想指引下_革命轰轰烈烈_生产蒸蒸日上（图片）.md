Under the guidance of the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution is roaring, and production is booming. Under the personal care and guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, in the unprecedented storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in the new high tide of the mass movement to thoroughly criticize the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been established!

All things grow with the help of the sun, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Workers in the B shift of the spinning section of Shanghai No. 31 Cotton Mill actively study and apply the "Three Old Articles," break down selfishness and promote public spirit, and fully embody the spirit of communism. They voluntarily support production sections with heavy tasks, becoming models of combining revolution with production. This is a scene of them studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and discussing their thoughts after work.

The PLA unit stationed in Qingdao responds to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, first supports industrial production work from a political and ideological perspective, and studies Chairman Mao's works together with revolutionary workers and cadres. The picture shows a cadre from a certain regiment of the PLA entering the Qingdao Steel Plant to have a heart-to-heart talk with revolutionary workers, vowing to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

The proletarian revolutionary masses of Taiyuan Transformer Factory actively carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and have launched a production competition across the entire factory.

Revolutionary workers of Guiyang Railway Bureau actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, grasp revolution, and promote production. The number of train turnarounds and cargo handling capacity have significantly increased. The picture shows train crew members seizing the time to study the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" before the train departs.

Revolutionary workers of Daqing Oilfield enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, grasp revolution, and vigorously promote production. Workers in the thermal cracking workshop of the refinery have recently achieved the best results in starting the operation.

Revolutionary leading cadres are the core and backbone of the "three-in-one" combination of revolution. After seizing power jointly, the red rebels of Harbin Power Plant firmly carry out Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, support revolutionary leading cadres to stand out and revolt together with the proletarian revolutionary masses. The committee member and deputy director of the factory revolutionary committee, Ye Shengeng (first from the left), fights and works together with revolutionary workers, winning the welcome of the masses.

Revolutionary workers in a certain mining area carry out Chairman Mao's great instruction to "grasp revolution, promote production" with practical actions. With the strong support of the PLA, they resolutely criticize the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party and promote production with the spirit of "seizing the day." The 4701 working class has continuously achieved good results in tunneling.
