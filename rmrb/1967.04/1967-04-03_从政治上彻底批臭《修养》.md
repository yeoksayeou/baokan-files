The publication of the editorial article in the fifth issue of "Red Flag" magazine and the article by Comrade Chen Boda mark a new stage in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—a stage of thoroughly criticizing the top capitalist-roader within the Party. I utterly detest the book "Self-Cultivation" written by the top capitalist-roader within the Party. This poisonous book, which completely divorces itself from class struggle, revolution, and political struggle to talk about "self-cultivation," has caused extensive harm and must be thoroughly denounced politically.

The book "Self-Cultivation" was thrown out by the top capitalist-roader within the Party in 1939. At that time, Japanese imperialism was rampantly invading China, and our people were in the deepest disaster. The most important political task for the entire nation was to unite under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and strike hard at the Japanese invaders. The book "Self-Cultivation," at this critical moment, avoided discussing the major political issues related to the survival of the nation and instead advocated for people to engage in personal "self-cultivation" divorced from political struggle. This is a fallacy that suits the needs of the Japanese imperialists. If we continue to "cultivate" in this way, we will face the danger of the Party and the nation perishing.

In 1962, due to consecutive natural disasters and sabotage by Soviet revisionists, our country was in a temporary period of economic difficulty. Domestic and foreign enemies joined forces to stage a grand anti-China chorus. Imperialism and revisionism tightened their collusion, Indian reactionaries launched an anti-China wave, the Kuomintang bandits clamored to counterattack the mainland, and social demons and ghosts of all kinds emerged, attempting to restore capitalism. At this juncture, driven by his class nature, the top capitalist-roader within the Party, after some disguise, threw out the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation" again. It still avoided discussing the class struggle situation at the time and did not mention anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. It only abstractly talked about personal "self-cultivation." This book is a hodgepodge of reactionary and decadent thoughts, openly preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

"Self-Cultivation" is a big poisonous arrow against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Some people have been poisoned by "Self-Cultivation," separating ideological remolding from revolutionary struggle, not caring about national affairs, and being politically wavering. To criticize "Self-Cultivation," we must politically denounce it in a big way, overthrowing and denouncing it.

Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment are the three great revolutionary movements for building a powerful socialist state. They are the reliable guarantee for communists to be free from bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism, and stand unshakable; they are the reliable guarantee for the proletariat to unite with the broad masses of the people and implement democratic dictatorship. Otherwise, if we let the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and ghosts and monsters all come out, and our cadres do not care, many of them even cannot distinguish between enemies and ourselves, collude with each other, and are corrupted and infiltrated by the enemy, disintegrated and split, pulled out and pushed in, and many workers, peasants, and intellectuals are also soft and hard by the enemy, then it will not take much time, a few years or a dozen years, tens of years, to inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color." In the past, I did not deeply understand Chairman Mao's teachings. The practice of the Cultural Revolution proves: To cultivate our youth into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and temper ourselves in the great storms of revolution. If we shut the door and cultivate according to the book "Self-Cultivation," we will become more and more "cultivated," and the whole of China will change color.

The harm caused by "Self-Cultivation" is extensive. Overthrowing and denouncing it is an important part of criticizing the capitalist reactionary line. We must launch a nationwide campaign to denounce "Self-Cultivation" and thoroughly eliminate its harmful influence.

    从政治上彻底批臭《修养》
    首都大专院校红代会核心组副组长、清华大学井冈山兵团负责人
  蒯大富
    《红旗》杂志第五期评论员文章和戚本禹同志文章的发表，标志着我国无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新阶段——彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。我恨透了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所写的《修养》。这本毒书完全脱离阶级斗争、脱离革命、脱离政治斗争来谈什么“修养”，流毒很广，必须从政治上把它彻底批臭。
    《修养》一书，是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在一九三九年抛出来的。当时，日本帝国主义猖狂地侵略中国，我们祖国人民正处在灾难最深重的时候，全国人民最重要的政治任务，是在中国共产党的领导下，团结一致，狠狠地打击日本侵略者。《修养》一书，在这个时候出笼，避而不谈有关民族存亡的重大政治问题，却要人们脱离政治斗争搞什么个人“修养”，这是适应日本帝国主义者需要的谬论。如果这样“修养”下去，我们就要亡党亡国。
    一九六二年，由于连续遭受自然灾害和苏修的破坏，我国处在暂时经济困难时期，国内外敌人勾结在一起演出了反华大合唱的丑剧。帝国主义、修正主义加紧勾结，蠢蠢欲动，印度反动派掀起反华高潮，蒋匪帮叫嚣反攻大陆，社会上的牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，妄图搞资本主义复辟。就在这个时候，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派出于他的阶级本性，经过一番乔装打扮，又把《修养》这株毒草抛了出来。它还是闭口不谈当时阶级斗争的形势，只字不提反帝反修，只是抽象地谈个人“修养”。这本书是反动腐朽思想的大杂烩，是明目张胆地为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。
    《修养》是一株反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的大毒箭。有些人就是中了《修养》的毒，把思想改造同革命斗争割裂开来，不关心国家大事，在政治上动摇不定。要批判《修养》，必须从政治上大批特批，把它批倒、批臭。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，是建设社会主义强大国家的三项伟大革命运动，是使共产党人免除官僚主义、避免修正主义和教条主义，永远立于不败之地的确实保证，是使无产阶级能够和广大劳动群众联合起来，实行民主专政的可靠保证。不然的话，让地、富、反、坏、牛鬼蛇神一齐跑了出来，而我们的干部则不闻不问，有许多人甚至敌我不分，互相勾结，被敌人腐蚀侵袭，分化瓦解，拉出去，打进来，许多工人、农民和知识分子也被敌人软硬兼施，照此办理，那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”过去，我对毛主席的这些教导体会得不够深刻。文化大革命的实践证明：要把我们青年一代培养成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，必须按照毛主席的教导，在革命的大风大浪里去经受锻炼。如果关起门来按照《修养》这本书修下去，就会越养越“修”，就会使整个中国改变颜色。
    《修养》的流毒很广，把它批倒、搞臭，是批判资产阶级反动路线的十分重要的内容。我们要在全国范围内，掀起一个批臭《修养》的高潮，彻底肃清其流毒。
