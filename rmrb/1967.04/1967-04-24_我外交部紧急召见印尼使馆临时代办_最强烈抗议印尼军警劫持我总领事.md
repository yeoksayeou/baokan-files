	China's Foreign Ministry urgently summoned the Chargé d'Affaires of the Indonesian Embassy in China, Baren, at 11 PM tonight to protest in the strongest terms the serious incident where Indonesian military and police besieged and sealed off the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, and armed forces abducted the Chinese Consul-General in Jakarta, Xu Ren.

	According to reports from Jakarta: Following the incident on the 22nd where hundreds of Indonesian rioters, instigated and supported by military and police, provoked the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, the Indonesian government openly dispatched a large number of military and police to surround and seal off the Chinese Embassy on the 23rd, prohibiting Chinese Embassy staff from leaving. When Chinese Embassy staff attempted to leave on two occasions for official business, Indonesian military and police openly threatened to abduct them with guns. At 5:45 PM, when Chinese Consul-General in Jakarta, Xu Ren, left the embassy to meet with the Director of the Asian and Pacific Affairs Department of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Subazo, as scheduled, he was immediately surrounded and abducted by Indonesian military and police who were besieging the Chinese Embassy, and was detained at the command center of the Indonesian 0503 Military District.

	The responsible official of the Foreign Ministry sternly pointed out: The Indonesian government openly dispatched armed forces to besiege and seal off the Chinese Embassy, and armed forces abducted the Chinese Consul-General, directly violating the personal freedom of Chinese diplomatic personnel. This is a blatant violation of international norms, a serious infringement on diplomatic privileges, a personal insult to Chinese diplomatic personnel, and a serious threat to their personal safety. This is intolerable!

	The responsible official of the Foreign Ministry warned the Indonesian government that the Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the diplomatic representatives of the Chinese people are fearless and cannot be intimidated by any threats. The Indonesian government must immediately issue a public apology, escort Consul-General Xu Ren back to the Chinese Embassy, immediately withdraw the military and police surrounding the Chinese Embassy, and ensure the safety of the Chinese Embassy and its staff. Otherwise, the Indonesian government will bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

    我外交部紧急召见印尼使馆临时代办
    最强烈抗议印尼军警劫持我总领事
    新华社二十三日讯　中国外交部负责人员今夜十一时紧急召见印度尼西亚驻华大使馆临时代办巴伦，就印尼军警包围封锁中国驻印尼大使馆、武装劫持中国驻雅加达总领事徐仁的严重事件，提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。
    据雅加达消息：继二十二日印尼数百名暴徒在军警怂恿和支持下向中国驻印尼大使馆进行挑衅之后，二十三日印尼政府又公然派出大批军警包围和封锁中国大使馆，禁止中国大使馆人员外出。当中国大使馆人员两次因公外出时，印尼军警公然用枪威胁要把中国大使馆人员劫走。下午五时四十五分，中国驻雅加达总领事徐仁按约定时间前往会见印尼外交部亚洲和太平洋司司长苏巴佐时，一出门口，竟然遭到包围中国大使馆的印尼军警的武装劫持，并被扣押在印尼0503军支区司令部。
    外交部负责人员严正指出：印尼政府公然派遣武装部队包围和封锁中国大使馆，并且武装劫持中国总领事，直接侵犯中国外交人员的人身自由，这是对国际关系准则的粗暴破坏，是对外交特权的严重侵犯，是对中国外交人员的人身侮辱，使中国外交人员的人身安全受到严重威胁，是可忍，孰不可忍？
    外交部负责人员警告印尼政府，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民的外交代表是无所畏惧的，是任何威胁吓唬不了的。印尼政府必须立即公开道歉，护送徐仁总领事返回中国大使馆，立即撤除包围中国大使馆的军警，保证中国大使馆和大使馆人员的安全。否则由此而产生的一切严重后果，必须由印尼政府承担。
