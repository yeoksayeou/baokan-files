After Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee issued the great call to the people of the countryside, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the communes, and cadres at all levels to seize the revolution and promote production, and to do a good job in spring plowing, the cultural revolution and agricultural production in the countryside have taken on a new look.

Currently, the enthusiasm of the broad masses and revolutionary cadres is high, and there is much to do. The saying by the comrades of Hongjin Brigade, Shaxi Commune, "Busy work must have a direction," is well put. As they say, if one is busy to the point of confusion, that is the mark of a fool. The revolution is busy, spring plowing is busy, and people's active thoughts are also more numerous. In this situation, one especially cannot do without a compass, and especially needs to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's thought actively.

The comrades of Hongjin Brigade, Shaxi Commune, in the midst of the busy spring plowing season, insist on putting the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works first, and focus on the thought revolution of the people. Thus, spring plowing production is done quickly and well. Their approach fully carries out the great line proposed by Chairman Mao of "seizing the revolution and promoting production."

A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are implementing a reactionary line of suppressing the revolution and sabotaging production. They oppose Mao Zedong thought guiding everything and oppose emphasizing proletarian politics in economic work. They advocate material incentives and follow the capitalist road. We proletarian revolutionaries must do the opposite. Proletarian revolutionaries leading production must emphasize proletarian politics and must have Mao Zedong thought guiding everything.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, every miracle in the world can be created." Comrade Lin Biao, based on Chairman Mao's thoughts, especially emphasizes that people are the first factor, political work is the first, ideological work is the first, and living thoughts are the first. We must continually arm the masses with Mao Zedong thought, solve all kinds of living thoughts, and promote the thought revolution of the people. When the people's thoughts are revolutionized, the active factors of the people are fully mobilized, and the strength and wisdom of the people are fully brought into play, with a correct political direction and abundant revolutionary enthusiasm, there will be no difficulties that cannot be overcome.

The command posts for seizing the revolution and promoting production in various places, the poor and lower-middle peasant revolutionaries, and revolutionary cadres must always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought during the spring plowing period. They must definitely put the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works first, definitely make the political atmosphere thick, and boost morale high, to fight a good battle in spring plowing production, and make great strides forward on the road of thought revolution.

    忙要忙得有方向
    在毛主席和党中央向全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部发出抓革命促生产，搞好春耕的伟大号召以后，农村的文化革命和农业生产出现了一个新的局面。
    当前，广大群众和革命干部的干劲很高，事情很忙。“忙要忙得有方向”，沙溪公社洪泾大队的同志们的这句话说得好。正象他们所说的，如果忙得晕头转向，那就是糊涂人。革命忙，春耕忙，人们的活思想也就比较多。在这种情况下，特别离不开方向盘，特别需要活学活用毛泽东思想。
    沙溪公社洪泾大队的同志们，在春耕生产大忙中，坚持把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，大抓人的思想革命化，春耕生产就搞得又快又好。他们这种作法，贯彻执行了毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，实行的是一条压制革命、破坏生产的反动路线。他们反对毛泽东思想统帅一切，反对在经济工作中突出无产阶级政治。他们搞的是物质刺激，他们走的是资本主义道路。我们无产阶级革命派必须反其道而行之。无产阶级革命派领导生产，就要突出无产阶级政治，就要毛泽东思想统帅一切。
    毛主席教导我们：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”林彪同志根据毛主席的思想，特别强调人的因素第一，政治工作第一，思想工作第一，活的思想第一。我们要不断地以毛泽东思想武装群众，解决各种各样的活思想，促进人的思想革命化。人的思想革命化了，人的积极因素充分调动起来了，人的力量和智慧充分发挥出来了，既有正确的政治方向，又有充沛的革命干劲，就没有克服不了的困难。
    各地抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，贫下中农革命派和革命干部们，在春耕期间，都要念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。一定要把活学活用毛主席著作放在第一位，一定要把政治空气搞得浓浓的，士气鼓得高高的，打好春耕生产这一仗，在思想革命化的大道上大大前进一步。
