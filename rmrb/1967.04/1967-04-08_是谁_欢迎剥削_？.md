In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have exposed China's Khrushchev—the top capitalist-roader in the Party. We have dug out the mastermind behind Chinese revisionism. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! It is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

The top capitalist-roader in the Party shamelessly claims that "exploitation saves people," "we should welcome exploitation," and "hiring laborers to farm is legal and beneficial to the people." These absurd statements have stirred up my old grievances and new hatreds.

Before liberation, my entire family toiled like beasts of burden for the landlords. I was a maidservant for the landlords, spending the whole day washing clothes, grinding grain, and cooking. My three sons were hired laborers, tending cattle and sheep. Even so, our family still couldn't eat or wear enough. When we borrowed grain from the landlords, we borrowed one shi in the spring and had to return one shi and five dou in the autumn. The landlords used small measures to give and large measures to receive. The landlord lords, indifferent to the lives of the poor, exploited the poor to indulge in eating, drinking, and merrymaking. I want to ask the top capitalist-roader in the Party: You say this is "saving people." If you continue to "save" people this way, will there still be a place for us poor and lower-middle peasants in the world? You dare to say we "welcome exploitation." This is purely a slander against us poor and lower-middle peasants. What we welcome is Chairman Mao leading us to overthrow imperialism, feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, to build socialism, and to build communism. We will resolutely eliminate you pests.

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have been liberated and established a socialist system. However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party is unrepentant, spreading evil everywhere, and fanning the capitalist wind. In our village, a small clique of capitalist-roaders in the Party, colluding with unrepentant landlords and rich peasants, engage in speculation, sabotage the collective economy, and suppress the poor and lower-middle peasants. This evil wind comes from the top capitalist-roader in the Party.

The ugly face of the top capitalist-roader in the Party has been exposed in broad daylight. We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, bravely and resolutely join the battle. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our most powerful weapon, we will criticize and denounce the top capitalist-roader in the Party until we achieve complete victory!

    是谁“欢迎剥削”？
    戎冠秀
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们揪出了中国的赫鲁晓夫——党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，挖出了中国修正主义的总后台，这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，胡说什么
  “剥削是救人”，“要欢迎剥削”，“雇工种地是合法的，对群众也有好处”。他这一派胡言乱语，使我的旧恨新仇又涌上了心头。
    解放前，我全家老小给地主当牛做马。我给地主当使女，整天给这些吸血鬼洗衣裳、推磨、做饭。我的三个儿子给地主当长工，放牛牧羊。就是这样，我们一家老小还是吃不上穿不上。向地主借粮，春借一石，秋还一石五斗，地主还小斗出，大斗入。地主老爷不顾穷人的死活，靠剥削穷人，吃喝作乐。我要问党内头号走资本主义道路当权派：你说这是“救人”，照这样“救”下去，世上还会有我们贫下中农的活路吗？你还胡说我们“欢迎剥削”，这纯粹是对我们贫下中农的诬蔑。我们欢迎的是毛主席领导我们打倒帝国主义，打倒封建主义，打倒资本主义，打倒修正主义，建设社会主义，建设共产主义。我们坚决铲除你们这些害人虫。
    毛主席领导我们，使我们得到了解放，建立了社会主义制度。可是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派贼心不死，到处兴妖作怪，大刮资本主义阴风。我们村的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，和没有改造好的地富分子勾结起来，同流合污，大搞投机倒把，破坏集体经济，打击贫下中农，这股妖风就是来自党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的丑恶嘴脸已经暴露在光天化日之下。我们贫下中农一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决地、勇敢地投入战斗，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想这一最锐利的武器，批倒批臭党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，不获全胜，绝不收兵！（据新华社电）
