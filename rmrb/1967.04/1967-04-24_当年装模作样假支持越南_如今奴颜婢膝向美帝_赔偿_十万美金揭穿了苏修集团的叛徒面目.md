	New York, April 20 (Xinhua) - The Soviet revisionist leadership recently expressed willingness to give the U.S. Amateur Athletic Union $100,000 as "compensation" for canceling the U.S.-Soviet track and field meet last year due to their pretentious "protest" against U.S. aggression in Vietnam. This once again exposes the Soviet revisionist leadership's shameful face of kowtowing to Washington in their collusion with U.S. imperialism.

	According to the agreement between the two countries, athletes from the Soviet Union and the United States were scheduled to compete in a track and field meet in Los Angeles on July 23-24, 1966. Unfortunately, just before the event, U.S. aggressors began bombing Hanoi and Haiphong suburbs in North Vietnam, escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam. This provoked strong protests from the Vietnamese people and people around the world. In this context, the Soviet revisionist leadership, who had always acted as a henchman for U.S. imperialism, put on a show by having Soviet athletes announce the cancellation of the event to "protest" against the United States.

	Unexpectedly, this performance by the Soviet revisionists, which was entirely contrived, infuriated the U.S. imperialists. After the Soviet revisionists canceled the Los Angeles meet, the Johnson administration immediately instructed the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Foy Kohler, to protest to the Soviet authorities, complaining that this action was "unfortunate" and "violated the spirit of the agreement." At the same time, the U.S. Amateur Athletic Union took the opportunity to blackmail the Soviet authorities, demanding $200,000 in compensation for the losses they incurred in their preparations.

	According to a report by a Western news agency on April 17 from New York, the Soviet revisionist leadership has recently agreed to Washington's demand, offering to "compensate" $100,000. By making this humiliating concession, they have settled the above-mentioned dispute. The Soviet revisionist leadership, which had canceled the track and field meet with the United States eight months ago to "protest" against U.S. aggression in Vietnam, now readily agrees to the U.S. demand for compensation. This cringing behavior even surprised the chairman of the U.S. Amateur Athletic Union, William H. Johnson. According to an Associated Press report, Johnson said in a statement on April 17 that he was "pleased" with the Soviet side's "gesture." He said, "We are very encouraged by this development." According to Johnson, the Soviet authorities not only agreed to compensate but also invited U.S. athletes to visit the Soviet Union.

	Since the Soviet revisionist leadership came to power, they have been eager to align with U.S. imperialism and vigorously promoted "cultural exchanges" aimed at "promoting understanding and improving relations" between the United States and the Soviet Union. As early as 1958, the Soviet Union and the United States decided to hold an annual "traditional" track and field meet. The New York Times, in commenting on one of the meets between the two countries, said that the athletes from the two countries "obviously competed with a sincere, brotherly spirit." This mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital encouraged the diplomats of the two countries to "learn from the athletes participating in the competition."

### 当年装模作样假支持越南　如今奴颜婢膝向美帝“赔偿”  十万美金揭穿了苏修集团的叛徒面目

    当年装模作样假支持越南　如今奴颜婢膝向美帝“赔偿”
    十万美金揭穿了苏修集团的叛徒面目
    新华社二十日讯　纽约消息：苏联修正主义领导集团最近表示愿意给美国业余田径联合会十万美元，作为苏联去年因为装腔作势地“抗议”美国侵略越南而取消去年两国田径赛计划的“赔偿”。这再次暴露了苏修领导集团为了同美帝加紧勾结对华盛顿奴颜婢膝的丑恶面目。
    根据苏美两国的协定，苏美两国运动员曾决定在去年七月二十三日到二十四日在美国洛杉矶举行田径比赛。事不“凑巧”，在这以前不久，美国侵略者的飞机开始接连轰炸越南民主共和国的河内和海防郊区，把侵越战争大大升级了一步，因而激起了越南人民和全世界人民的愤怒抗议。在这种情况下，一贯充当美帝帮凶的苏修领导集团故作姿态，由苏联运动员出面宣布取消这次比赛，以示对美国的“抗议”。
    谁料，苏修的这场本来完全是有难言之隐的表演，却触动了美帝的肝火。在苏修取消在洛杉矶的比赛后，约翰逊政府随即指使美国驻苏联大使科勒就这件事向苏联当局提出抗议，发脾气说，这种做法是“不幸的”，“违反了协定精神”。同时，美国业余田径联合会趁机要挟，要苏联当局为他们在准备工作中遭到的损失赔偿二十万美元。
    据西方通讯社四月十七日自纽约报道，苏修领导集团最近已经同意华盛顿的要求，答应“赔偿”十万美元，用这种辱国性的让步，了结了双方的上述“争论”。苏修集团八个多月前用取消同美国的田径赛来“抗议”美国侵略越南，现在却满口答应美国的赔偿要求。这种卑躬屈膝行为连美国业余田径联合会主席赫尔也大出所料。据美联社报道，赫尔在十七日发表谈话时指出，他对苏联方面的这个“姿态表示高兴”。他说，“我们对这种发展感到十分鼓舞”。据赫尔说，苏联当局不仅答应赔偿，还要邀请美国运动员去苏联访问。
    苏修领导集团上台后，为了向美帝国主义靠拢，竭力推行“目标在于促进美苏两国之间的谅解和改善关系”的“文化交流”。早在一九五八年，苏联和美国就决定每年举行“传统的”两国田径赛。《纽约时报》在评论两国的一次田径赛时说，两国运动员“显然是抱着真诚的兄弟般的精神进行比赛的”。这家美国垄断资本的喉舌为此在社论中鼓励苏美两国的外交代表们“应当向参加比赛的（美苏）运动员学习”。
