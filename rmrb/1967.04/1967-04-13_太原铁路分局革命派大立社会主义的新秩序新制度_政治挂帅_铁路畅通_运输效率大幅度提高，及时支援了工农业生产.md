The revolutionary faction of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, since taking power in mid-February, has, with the assistance of the propaganda team from the Shaanxi Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, widely promoted the valuable experience of the PLA in emphasizing politics. They have combined revolution with production, prioritized politics in transportation, and swiftly established a good new order for railway transportation. This has timely supported industrial production and spring agricultural production.

Since entering March, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau has basically eliminated the phenomenon of accumulated freight cars waiting to be unloaded. Transportation efficiency has significantly improved. The turnover time for each freight car has been shortened by 28.3% compared to before the takeover. The operating order of passenger and freight trains has gradually returned to normal. The punctuality rate for passenger train departures has basically reached 100%, and the punctuality rate for freight train departures has reached 93.2%. Loading and unloading tasks have been overfulfilled. On March 23, a record high for daily loading and unloading was set, the highest since the bureau's establishment four years ago.

Mao Zedong Thought is the Foundation of Power

After taking power, the revolutionary faction of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau inherited a mess from a small clique of capitalist-roaders. This clique emphasized indicators first, promoted material incentives, and vigorously pushed capitalist and revisionist rules and regulations, causing widespread and deep harm. During the Cultural Revolution, they abandoned production to protect themselves, incited infighting among the masses, and then engaged in counter-revolutionary economism, corrupting the masses and inciting them to leave their posts. This resulted in a serious laxity in labor discipline, causing the entire bureau's transportation work to be paralyzed for a time. The punctuality rate of trains dropped significantly, and the loading plan for January was only completed by 80.4%. In the 13 days before the takeover in February, 5,000 tons of goods could not be transported daily.

After taking power, the revolutionary faction of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, together with the PLA soldiers, used Mao Zedong Thought as the foundation of their power. They emphasized politics, launched a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and started from promoting the ideological transformation of people. They focused on revolution and vigorously promoted transportation.

They successively held full-time, part-time, and extracurricular training classes led by PLA instructors to cultivate cadres and activists who study Chairman Mao's works. They helped departments and grassroots teams establish and maintain the system of studying Chairman Mao's works, ensuring that the study of Chairman Mao's works is placed at the forefront of all work. They used Chairman Mao's teachings as the highest directive for doing transportation work well.

In a previous period, due to the shortage of cars, the personnel of the first-line command post for combining revolution with production in the bureau lacked confidence in completing the March transportation tasks. When arranging work, they only dared to say "strive for" and did not dare to say "guarantee." Facing this mentality, everyone studied Mao Zedong's teachings on subjective initiative in "On Protracted War," recognizing that through subjective efforts, objective conditions can be changed. Thus, they mobilized the workers to adopt methods such as quick loading, quick unloading, pulling more, and running fast, as well as cooperating with relevant factories and mines. They overfulfilled the March loading task.

Building the Leadership Team on a Solid Mass Foundation

Modern railway transportation requires a highly centralized and unified command system. Before the takeover, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party implemented the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a few," which dampened the enthusiasm of many mid-level and grassroots cadres and production team leaders. The entire production command system was seriously dysfunctional.

The revolutionary faction of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, on the one hand, selected responsible persons from revolutionary organizations, revolutionary mid-level cadres, and technical personnel to form a production leadership group to lead the bureau's transportation production command work comprehensively. On the other hand, they strengthened political and ideological work, launched a rectification movement within various revolutionary organizations, deeply propagated Chairman Mao's cadre policy, educated the masses to correctly treat cadres, and educated cadres who made mistakes to correctly treat the masses' criticism. They put down their mental burdens and went to work to make amends. The revolutionary faction directed the struggle against a small clique of capitalist-roaders, thoroughly criticized their bourgeois reactionary line on the cadre issue, and helped the deceived masses return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Through a series of political and ideological work, the revolutionary faction united the majority of cadres and masses around themselves, establishing revolutionary and production leadership teams on a solid mass foundation. Now, most mid-level cadres in the departmental business sections participate in the transportation production command work. Some bureau-level and mid-level cadres have been absorbed into the revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership team, strengthening the transportation production command system. With the help of the PLA, 28 grassroots units have established revolutionary "three-in-one" production leadership teams, and the transportation command work of grassroots stations and sections has also returned to normal. In mid-March, the entire bureau formally established the "three-in-one" first-line command post for combining revolution with production. Now, the entire bureau's transportation command is centralized, flexible, coordinated from top to bottom, and unified in steps.

Breaking Old Frameworks and Establishing New Orders

The revolutionary faction of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau and revolutionary workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "not breaking means not establishing," thoroughly smashed the capitalist and revisionist old rules and frameworks, and established new socialist orders and systems.

In the past, the railway did not consider production needs but only its own convenience, often lacking a plan for assigning cars; factories and mines did not consider the use of vehicles and did not organize forces to unload cars in a timely manner. Therefore, many vehicles were often stranded on the factory and mine's dedicated railway lines. The Taiyuan Railway Bureau decided to thoroughly smash this localism framework and actively sent people to major factories and mines for cooperation. The railway, starting from adapting to the production needs of factories and mines and facilitating the unloading operations of factories and mines, implemented planned, balanced, and timely car assignments by category, quantity, and time. They first improved the unloading system.

In the past, the approval of transportation plans for various materials had to be centralized to the bureau; materials not included in the plan were refused to be transported; locomotives of various locomotive sections could only operate within their own jurisdiction and could not cross boundaries. These unreasonable systems were also impacted. The revolutionary faction used the fastest, most economical, and most beneficial methods for the overall interests of the revolution to arrange transportation production. To ensure the timely transportation of spring agricultural materials, the temporary car approval power for spring agricultural and drought-resistant materials was delegated to the stations, ensuring that spring agricultural and drought-resistant materials could be prioritized for car allocation and loading and unloading. In March, 60,000 tons of urgently needed fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and agricultural tools for spring plowing were timely transported to the front line of spring plowing.

    太原铁路分局革命派大立社会主义的新秩序新制度
    政治挂帅　铁路畅通
    运输效率大幅度提高，及时支援了工农业生产
    本报讯　太原铁路分局无产阶级革命派二月中旬掌权以来，在人民解放军山西军区派到分局的毛泽东思想宣传队的大力协助下，普遍推行解放军突出政治的宝贵经验，抓革命促生产，以政治统帅运输，迅速建立了良好的铁路运输新秩序，及时地支援了工业生产和春耕生产。
    进入三月份后，太原铁路分局货车积压待卸的现象基本消除，运输效率大幅度提高，每辆货车的周转时间比夺权前缩短百分之二十八点三；客货列车运行秩序日趋正常，客车出发基本上达到了列列正点，货车出发正点率达到了百分之九十三点二；装车卸车都超额完成计划。三月二十三日创造了太原铁路分局成立四年来日装车和日卸车的最高纪录。
          毛泽东思想是掌权的根本
    太原铁路分局无产阶级革命派夺权后，从局内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里接过来的，是一个陷于瘫痪状态的烂摊子。这一小撮人在铁路运输中，强调指标第一，大搞物质刺激，竭力推行资本主义和修正主义的一套规章制度，流毒很广很深。在文化大革命中，他们为了保护自己，不但放弃生产不管，而且挑动群众斗群众，随后又大搞反革命经济主义，腐蚀群众，煽动群众擅离生产岗位，造成劳动纪律严重松弛，使整个分局的运输工作一度处于瘫痪状态。列车正点率严重下降，装车计划一月份仅完成百分之八十点四，二月份夺权前的十三天中，每天有五千多吨货物运不出去。
    夺权以后，太原铁路分局无产阶级革命派，同解放军指战员一起，用毛泽东思想作为掌权的根本，大力突出政治，开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，从促进人的思想革命化入手，狠抓革命，猛促运输。
    他们陆续举办了由解放军指导员辅导的脱产、半脱产和业余的学习毛主席著作训练班，培养学习毛主席著作的骨干和积极分子，帮助机关科室和基层班组建立和坚持学习毛主席著作的制度，保证把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，以毛主席的教导作为做好运输工作的最高指示。
    前一段时间，因为货多车少，分局抓革命促生产第一线指挥部的人员，对完成三月份运输任务信心不足，在安排工作时，只敢提“力争”，不敢提“保证”。针对这个思想，大家学习了毛主席在《论持久战》中关于主观能动性的教导，认识到经过主观努力，可以改变客观条件，于是发动职工采取快装、快卸、多拉、快跑以及和有关厂矿协作的办法，超额完成了三月份的装车任务。
    把领导班子建立在巩固的群众基础上
    现代化的铁路运输，必须有一个高度集中统一的指挥系统。夺权前，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派执行了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，使不少中层干部、基层干部和生产班组长的工作积极性受到挫折，整个生产指挥系统严重失灵。
    太原铁路分局无产阶级革命派一面抽出革命组织负责人和革命中层干部、技术人员组成生产领导小组，全面领导分局运输生产指挥工作；一面加强政治思想工作，在各革命组织内部开展整风运动，深入地宣传毛主席的干部政策，教育群众正确地对待干部，教育犯错误的干部正确地对待群众的批评，放下思想包袱，到工作中去立功补过。革命派把斗争的矛头指向一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判他们在干部问题上执行的资产阶级反动路线，同时，帮助那些受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线一边。
    经过一系列的政治思想工作，无产阶级革命派把大多数干部和群众团结到自己周围，使革命和生产两套领导班子建立在巩固的群众基础上。现在，机关的业务科室的绝大部分中层干部参加了运输生产指挥工作。一部分分局领导干部和中层干部已被吸收到革命的“三结合”领导班子中来，加强了运输生产指挥系统。在解放军的帮助下，二十八个基层单位已经建立起革命的“三结合”的生产领导班子，基层站段的运输指挥工作也走上了正轨。三月中旬，全分局正式成立了“三结合”的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部。现在整个分局的运输指挥集中灵活，上下贯通，步调一致。
          破除旧框框　建立新秩序
    太原铁路分局无产阶级革命派和革命职工，遵照毛主席关于不破不立的教导，大破资本主义和修正主义的旧条条、旧框框，大立社会主义的新秩序新制度。
    过去，铁路不管生产需要情况，只考虑自己方便，配车往往缺乏计划；厂矿不顾车辆使用情况，不及时组织力量卸车。因此，经常有很多车辆积压在厂矿铁路专用线上。太原铁路分局决心彻底粉碎这个本位主义的框框，主动派人到各主要厂矿搞好协作。铁路方面从适应厂矿生产需要和便利厂矿卸车作业出发，实行了按品种、按数量、按时间，有计划地均衡地配车，并且首先改进了卸车制度。
    过去，各种物资运输计划的批准，一律要集中到分局办理；没有纳入计划的货物一律拒绝承运；各机务段的机车只能在自己管辖的范围内运行，不能越界行驶。这些不合理的制度也都受到了冲击。无产阶级革命派用最迅速、最经济、最有利于革命全局利益的办法安排运输生产。为了保证及时装运春耕物资，将春耕和抗旱物资的临时要车批准权下放到车站，保证春耕抗旱物资能够优先拨车、优先装卸。三月份已把六万吨春耕急需的肥料、农药、种籽、农械等，及时运到了春耕第一线。
