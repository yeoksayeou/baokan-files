Chairman Mao proposed that in places and units where power needs to be seized, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian temporary power organ. This power organ is best named the Revolutionary Committee.

Make Beijing a City Radiant with the Brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought

The capital's military and civilians enthusiastically celebrated the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. The city was filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and red flags were waving everywhere. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" echoed through the sky. The broad revolutionary masses vowed to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to combine the criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units, and to promote revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination" through the great criticism. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers vowed to be humble and prudent, to love the people, and to forever fight alongside the proletarian revolutionaries.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 21st, the capital's revolutionary masses' activities celebrating the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee reached a climax today. From yesterday to this evening, the entire city has been immersed in the joyous atmosphere of a grand revolutionary festival. Factories, villages, schools, offices, shops, and streets were filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and red flags were waving everywhere. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" and the revolutionary song "The Ship of the Sea Depends on the Helmsman" echoed through the sky. Revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary masses continuously gathered at the site of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee to deliver congratulatory messages and letters. The vast Tiananmen Square became a sea of joy. The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary masses excitedly said: No matter how many words we use, we cannot express our boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. We resolutely respond to the call made by Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Jiang Qing at the meeting, and we resolutely support the report by Comrade Xie Fuzhi. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seize power well, and use power well. We will definitely more thoroughly, more deeply, and more comprehensively expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and combine this great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our own units. In the struggle, we will strengthen and develop revolutionary great unity, promote the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, achieving victory in both revolution and production.

The site of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee became the center of the grand celebration activities. Countless congratulatory messages and letters expressed the revolutionary masses' common voice: Glory belongs to the great leader Chairman Mao, and glory belongs to the great Mao Zedong Thought. The broad revolutionary masses cheered: The birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee proclaims to the whole country and the world the new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and once again sounds the charge for a more ferocious general assault on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party; it issues a battle order to the proletarian revolutionaries and broad revolutionary masses to deeply carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to launch a new high tide of seizing revolution and promoting production.

The members of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the broad revolutionary masses of the capital celebrated this grand festival together. They vowed not to disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao and the broad revolutionary masses' trust and expectations, to never deviate from Mao Zedong Thought and the masses in their future work, to wholeheartedly serve the people, and to build Beijing into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought together with the broad revolutionary masses.

In factories, people's communes, schools, offices, and streets, everywhere was a scene of joyous celebration. The revolutionary workers of the Capital Iron and Steel Company held a grand celebration meeting. The steel workers vowed to firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to seize revolution and promote production under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, vowing to raise their iron fists and smash all the ghosts and snakes to pieces. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory said, Chairman Mao teaches us that seizing power is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li. We will definitely better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, build our ranks into a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready revolutionary army, welcome new battles, and achieve new victories.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary youngsters and poor and lower-middle peasants of the Nanguan Brigade of the Tuoli People's Commune in Fangshan County, who have undergone severe tests, unanimously vowed: to firmly support the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, to firmly carry out the resolutions of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, to be a strong backbone for the Revolutionary Committee, and to achieve a double harvest in revolution and agricultural production.

Many revolutionary teachers and students and revolutionary cultural workers performed artistic programs on Tiananmen Square, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and joyously celebrating the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Some revolutionary cultural workers and amateur performance teams from Tianjin also rushed to participate in the celebratory performances.

The Red Guards and broad revolutionary teachers and students of the capital's universities and colleges held grand celebratory meetings. Tens of thousands of Red Guards rushed to the site of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee to offer congratulations. The Red Guards vowed to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, to overthrow and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party with greater combat effectiveness, to eliminate their poison in all fields. They vowed to thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools, to let the great Mao Zedong Thought occupy all educational positions.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 21st, the People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers who have made new contributions to the capital's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution joyfully celebrated the birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee with excited hearts. The soldiers and officers unanimously pointed out: The establishment of the Revolutionary Committee is a new milestone in the capital's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They vowed to resolutely respond to the call of the great commander Chairman Mao, to closely unite with and fight alongside the proletarian revolutionary comrades, to win together, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on all battlefields.

In the past two days, the broad ranks of soldiers and officers guarding Chairman Mao and the broad revolutionary masses of the capital have been immersed in the joy of the festival. They held high the radiant red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," beat drums and gongs, marched in formation, and joyfully shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!"

In 1949, the soldiers and officers of the Red First Company of a certain unit, together with their brother units, liberated Beijing and seized power from the hands of the reactionary Kuomintang. They said, Over the past few decades, Chairman Mao has led the people's army through countless battles, enduring cold and hardship, fearing neither bloodshed nor sacrifice, all for the sake of seizing power. Today, Chairman Mao leads us again to seize power from the hands of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee. This is a great joyous event. We, the guard soldiers standing by Chairman Mao's side, are determined to defend Chairman Mao and the capital of the people. Whoever tries to seize the power of the proletariat, we will fight to the end.

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers supporting industrial and agricultural production in factories, mines, enterprises, and people's communes immediately held celebratory meetings with revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres upon hearing the news of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

The leadership organs and subordinate units of the Navy, Air Force, Communications Corps, Artillery Corps, and Railway Corps, as well as the Rear Services Academy and other units, also held meetings and parades.

Many representatives attending the conference of active learners and appliers of Chairman Mao's works in the Beijing Army expressed their determination to more resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call, to support the broad leftist masses, and to create new achievements for the capital's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Class leader Wang Shouyin, who had just returned from assisting local work, said: "Comrade Jiang Qing spoke at the celebratory meeting, representing the Central Cultural Revolution Group, requiring us to correctly treat the masses and to love the people. This strikes a chord with us. We are the people's army created by Chairman Mao. We will definitely love the people, be humble and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and humbly learn from the proletarian revolutionaries. We vow to be a strong backbone for the proletarian revolutionaries and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

"Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been established! The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee has been thoroughly smashed!" The proletarian revolutionaries of the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory were all excited and beaming with joy. The propaganda team of the factory carried a big red congratulatory message, cheering the birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.
