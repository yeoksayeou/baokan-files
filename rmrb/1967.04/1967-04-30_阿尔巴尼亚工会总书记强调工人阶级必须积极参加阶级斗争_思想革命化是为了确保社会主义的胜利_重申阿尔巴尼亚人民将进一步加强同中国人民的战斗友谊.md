Albanian Trade Union Secretary Emphasizes Workers Must Actively Participate in Class Struggle
Thought Revolutionization to Ensure Victory of Socialism
Albanian People to Further Strengthen Combat Friendship with Chinese People

Tirana, April 28 -- Albanian Trade Union Central Council Secretary T. Jakova delivered a report titled "On the Work of the Albanian Trade Union Central Council and the Tasks for Implementing the Decisions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party" at the Sixth Congress of the Albanian Trade Unions on April 24.

The report first introduced and analyzed the current excellent situation in Albania. The report pointed out that under the inspiration of the revolutionary decisions of the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian working people have displayed even greater creativity, and a new high tide of revolutionization has emerged throughout the country. The revolutionization of power is continuing, and the cultural revolution is being deepened. On this basis, the speed of production development has accelerated.

The report pointed out that the Albanian working class and all the people have taken action to wage a fierce class struggle against various manifestations of bourgeois and revisionist thought.

When discussing the current international situation, the report severely condemned the crimes committed by the American imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership against the world's people, particularly condemning the collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States in crazily expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam and playing the "peace talks" trick.

The report said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, under the guidance of the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has thoroughly smashed the reactionary bourgeois line, destroyed the forces of revisionist betrayal, dealt a heavy blow to the imperialists and revisionists, and advanced the socialist revolution.

Jakova, in his report on the heroic struggle of the Albanian people against imperialism and revisionism and the socialist construction of Albania, said that in difficult times, socialist Albania has received brotherly, comprehensive, and selfless aid from the brotherly People's Republic of China. On this platform, allow me to represent the Albanian working class in expressing our gratitude to the great Chinese people, the heroic Chinese working class, the glorious Communist Party of China, and Chairman Mao for this sublime internationalist aid. We assure you that, like all the Albanian people, the Albanian working class, under the education of the proletarian internationalism spirit of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, will strive with all our might to further strengthen the friendship between our two countries and, under the guidance of the banner of Marxism-Leninism, fight for the lofty ideals of revolution and communism in any circumstances.

When discussing the issue of educating workers in communism, the report said that the Party's important decision on further revolutionizing national life has presented our working class with a major historical task. The basic content of this revolutionary process is to struggle against the road to capitalist restoration, to promote the socialist revolution in all fields, to ensure the victories already achieved, and to strive for the ultimate victory of the working class and the laboring masses. This is a struggle between two opposing roads of socialism and capitalism, a struggle between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, and a manifestation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. As long as the danger of capitalist restoration exists, this struggle will continue for a long time. In this historical struggle that decides the fate of socialism, the working class—the most advanced and revolutionary class in society, the embodiment of the great ideals of socialism and communism—should, as always, play a decisive role.

The report continued, for this reason, trade unions must further strengthen their educational work, so that the working class can correctly and deeply understand class struggle, educate workers with the spirit of irreconcilable class struggle, enable them to master the method of class analysis, always emphasize proletarian politics, and actively participate in the class struggle.

Under the current conditions, trade unions should particularly emphasize the class struggle on the ideological front, emphasize the struggle against bourgeois and revisionist thought, and struggle against all thoughts, habits, and traditions of the exploiting class. They should be eradicated from the ideological consciousness of the working class and the laboring masses, so that our socialist and communist thoughts, ethics, and worldviews can achieve victory in all fields.

It is necessary to deeply understand the important conclusions of the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party: as long as the socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural fields is not completely victorious, the victory of the socialist revolution in the political and economic fields is also not guaranteed. Therefore, the struggle to smash bourgeois and revisionist thought in the ideological field is ultimately a matter of building socialism and communism, preventing capitalist restoration, or opening the door to the spread of bourgeois and revisionist thought and returning to capitalism.

When discussing the international workers' movement, the report said that the revisionist elements of the Soviet trade unions have imposed their anti-worker traitor line on the workers' movement, leading the World Federation of Trade Unions into the quagmire of pacifism, reformism, and opportunism, down the road of surrender to imperialism, undermining national liberation struggles, engaging in class collaboration, and submitting to the bourgeoisie. This counter-revolutionary opportunist line, this treacherous policy, and this hostile trend are the fundamental cause of the split in the unity of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Khrushchev revisionists and the leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions under their control, in collusion with the old agents of the bourgeoisie, the leaders of the yellow unions, and new traitors, have become tools and running dogs of the bourgeoisie and imperialism to sabotage the unity and struggle of the working class.

The report said that today, in many countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, there are widespread movements of the working class, and teams of true revolutionary fighters are being formed and advancing. These movements are increasingly supported by the working masses. They regard these organizations as their revolutionary organizations, which have nothing in common with the reformist organizations of the revisionists. The report pointed out that the Albanian Trade Unions provide the greatest help and support to these organizations and regard this as their internationalist duty.

    阿尔巴尼亚工会总书记强调工人阶级必须积极参加阶级斗争
    思想革命化是为了确保社会主义的胜利
    重申阿尔巴尼亚人民将进一步加强同中国人民的战斗友谊
    据新华社地拉那二十八日电　阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会总书记托·雅科瓦二十四日在阿尔巴尼亚工会第六次代表大会上，作了“关于阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会的工作和为贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会决议的任务”的报告。
    报告首先介绍和分析了阿尔巴尼亚当前的大好形势。报告指出，阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民在劳动党的革命化决议的鼓舞下，更有力地发挥了自己的创造力，全国城乡出现了革命化的新高潮，政权革命化在继续进行，思想文化革命在深入开展，在这场广泛的群众性运动的基础上，生产的发展速度加快了。
    报告指出，阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级和全体人民已经行动起来，对资产阶级和修正主义思想的各种表现进行着激烈的阶级斗争。
    报告在谈到当前国际形势时，严厉地谴责了美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团对世界人民犯下的各种罪行，特别谴责了苏美勾结疯狂扩大侵越战争和玩弄“和谈”阴谋。
    报告说，中国无产阶级文化大革命在毛泽东主席的伟大思想红旗的指引下，彻底粉碎了资产阶级反动路线，摧毁了修正主义背叛势力，给了帝国主义者和修正主义者以沉重的打击，推进了社会主义革命。
    雅科瓦在报告中谈到阿尔巴尼亚人民同帝国主义和修正主义进行的英勇斗争，以及阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义建设时说，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚在困难的时刻，得到了兄弟中华人民共和国的兄弟般的、全面的和无私的援助。在这个讲坛上，请允许我代表阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级感谢伟大的中国人民、英雄的中国工人阶级、光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席所给予的这一崇高的国际主义援助，并向他们保证，同全体阿尔巴尼亚人民一样，阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级在党和霍查同志的无产阶级国际主义精神教育下，今后将全力为进一步加强我们两国之间的友谊而奋斗，将在任何环境里，在马克思列宁主义旗帜指引下，为革命和共产主义的崇高理想而奋斗。
    报告在谈到对工人进行共产主义教育的问题时说，党关于国家生活进一步革命化的重要决议给我国工人阶级提出了重大的历史任务。这一革命进程的基本内容是为堵塞资本主义复辟的道路而斗争，为推进各个领域内的社会主义革命，确保已经取得的胜利，争取工人阶级和劳动群众的最终目的的彻底胜利而斗争。这是一场社会主义和资本主义两条相反的道路之间的斗争，是一场马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争的表现。只要资本主义复辟的危险存在，这场斗争就将长期继续下去，在这场决定社会主义命运的历史性斗争中，工人阶级——社会上最先进和最革命的阶级、社会主义和共产主义伟大理想的体现者，应该一如既往地起着决定性的作用。
    报告接着说，为此，工会必须进一步加强教育工作，使工人阶级正确地和深刻地认识阶级斗争，用不可调和的阶级斗争的精神教育工人，使他们掌握阶级分析方法，永远突出无产阶级政治，使工人阶级积极参加阶级斗争。
    在当前的条件下，工会应该特别重视思想战线上的阶级斗争，重视反对资产阶级和修正主义思想，反对剥削阶级的一切思想、习惯和传统的斗争，把它们从工人阶级和劳动群众的思想意识中根除掉，让我们的社会主义和共产主义的思想、道德和世界观在一切领域里取得胜利。
    应该深刻地理解劳动党第五次代表大会的重要结论：只要思想文化领域里的社会主义革命不获全胜，那么政治和经济领域里的社会主义革命胜利也就没有保证。因此在思想领域里粉碎资产阶级和修正主义思想的斗争，归根到底，是关系到建成社会主义、共产主义，防止资本主义复辟，还是为散布资产阶级和修正主义思想敞开大门，回到资本主义的问题。
    报告在谈到国际工人运动时说，苏联工会的修正主义分子把他们的反工人的叛徒路线强加给工人运动，把世界工联引向和平主义、改良主义和机会主义的泥坑，拉到投降于帝国主义、破坏民族解放斗争、进行阶级合作和屈从于资产阶级的道路上去。这条反革命的机会主义路线，这个叛卖方针，这种敌对的思潮，是分裂世界工联团结的根本原因。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者以及在他们操纵下的世界工联领导人，勾结社会民主党资产阶级的老牌代理人、黄色工会的头子和新的叛徒，成了资产阶级和帝国主义用以破坏工人阶级团结和斗争的工具和走狗。
    报告说，今天在欧洲、亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲许多国家中出现了工人阶级的广泛的运动，建立了正在不断前进的真正的革命战士的队伍。这些运动日益为工人群众所拥护。他们把这些组织看成是同修正主义者的改良主义组织毫无共同之处的自己的革命组织。报告指出，阿尔巴尼亚工会给予这些组织以最大的帮助和支持，并把这看成是自己的国际主义义务。
