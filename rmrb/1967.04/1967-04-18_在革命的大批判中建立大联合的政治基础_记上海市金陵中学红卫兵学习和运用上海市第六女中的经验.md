During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards of Jinling Middle School in Shanghai demonstrated a fearless revolutionary spirit, breaking through numerous obstacles to establish more than ten revolutionary Red Guard organizations. In the great struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, their general direction was consistent. According to the needs of the struggle, they had established a liaison station for the revolutionary faction, directing their attacks at the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. However, due to the disruption caused by the capitalist roaders' reactionary line proposed by the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, the lingering influence of the reactionary bloodline theory of the exploiting class, and the impact of non-proletarian ideologies, these Red Guard organizations developed certain divisions and oppositions. Over a period of three months, the various revolutionary organizations engaged in mutual debates and fought unprincipled "internal wars." The resumption of classes and the revolution was delayed, and the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road was also put on hold.

After the publication of articles such as "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line in the Handling of Cadres Must Be Criticized" by the editorial board of the *Red Flag* magazine and "Patriotism or Treason?" by Comrade Chen Boda, a nationwide wave of revolutionary criticism swept across the country. The revolutionary Red Guards of this school rose up to denounce the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. Through the criticism, they realized that the previous conflicts among the organizations were not the responsibility of certain organizations or individuals. The root cause lay with the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, who, in collusion with another major capitalist-roader within the Party, had thrown out a bourgeois reactionary line, causing conflicts and oppositions among the students. The "self" in the minds of some students, and various non-proletarian ideologies, were also derived from his concocted reactionary work, *Self-Cultivation*. The Red Guards of these organizations believed that the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, in collusion with another major capitalist-roader within the Party, had thrown out the bourgeois reactionary line to suppress and strike down revolutionary fighters. They also used the bourgeois reactionary line to instigate "internal wars" among the revolutionary factions, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flame and shift the direction of the struggle, allowing their handful to slip through. We must not be deceived; we must concentrate our firepower and direct our guns at the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. Through the criticism, the revolutionary youngsters of this school established a political and ideological foundation for unity.

After the experience of the revolutionary youngsters of the Sixth Girls' Middle School in Shanghai in achieving great unity through revolutionary criticism was published, it greatly inspired the revolutionary Red Guards of Jinling Middle School. They organized students to study the reports and editorials published in the newspapers and went to the Sixth Girls' Middle School to learn from them. Through learning, these Red Guard organizations, starting from the desire for unity, carried out criticism and self-criticism. Many classes also held meetings to expose, criticize, and denounce the heinous crimes of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and his proposed bourgeois reactionary line, jointly directing their attacks at the Khrushchev of China and the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. At the meeting, everyone recalled the history of their revolutionary rebellion, recalled the persecution they suffered under the bourgeois reactionary line, and discussed the current excellent situation in the country and Shanghai, arousing a strong sense of political responsibility and even more vigorous revolutionary spirit. Their hatred for the number one capitalist-roader within the Party also intensified. They declared, "We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards, and we listen to Chairman Mao the most. We must, in this round of criticism, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, continue to carry forward the spirit of daring to fight and daring to win, and criticize and overthrow the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. Now, the general offensive against the number one capitalist-roader within the Party has begun, and a new, more arduous task lies ahead. Why should we still fight 'internal wars' and weaken our own strength? Many revolutionary youngsters said: No matter what, the issue of our debate is not as important as the struggle against the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. They said, there are thousands and thousands of reasons for the proletarian revolutionary factions to unite, but not a single reason to fight 'internal wars' and cause splits. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching: 'To organize tens of millions of people, to mobilize a surging revolutionary army, is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution.' They decided, with the revolutionary spirit of 'seizing the day,' to unite and consolidate on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and to unite in the revolutionary criticism.

Many classes of Red Guards, through criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminated estrangement, enhanced unity, and established unified Red Guard squads. Some grades established Red Guard columns, and the entire school established a preparatory committee for the great unity of Red Guards, preparing to establish a unified revolutionary Red Guard organization for the entire school. They said, Chairman Mao teaches us: 'You should care about state affairs and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!' The current moment is the crucial time for the struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions to seize power. We must consider the overall situation, seek common ground while reserving differences, unite all revolutionary teachers and students in the school, and raise the banner of revolutionary criticism high. We must criticize and overthrow the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, and combine the criticism of him with the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school. We must thoroughly cut off his black hands reaching into the school and eliminate his pernicious influence in the school, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!

    在革命的大批判中建立大联合的政治基础
    ——记上海市金陵中学红卫兵学习和运用上海市第六女中的经验
    上海市金陵中学的红卫兵在文化大革命中，发扬了大无畏的革命精神，冲破重重障碍，建立了十多个革命的红卫兵组织。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，他们的大方向是一致的。根据斗争的需要，他们曾经成立了革命派的联络站，把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。但是，由于党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线的破坏，由于剥削阶级的反动血统论的流毒还没有肃清，加上非无产阶级思想的影响，使这些红卫兵组织之间造成了一定的隔阂和对立。在为时三个月的时间内，各个革命组织之间相互争论，打无原则的“内战”，复课闹革命迟迟不能进行，把对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争也搁在了一边。
    《红旗》杂志评论员的文章《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》和戚本禹同志的文章《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》等发表后，全国掀起了轰轰烈烈的革命的大批判运动，这个学校的革命红卫兵纷纷起来口诛笔伐党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。在大批判中，他们认识到，以前各组织之间所以发生矛盾，责任不在某些组织和某些同学，它的根子是在党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，是他勾结党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路的当权派抛出了一条资产阶级反动路线，造成了同学间的矛盾和对立。某些同学头脑中的“私”字，各种非无产阶级思想，不少也是来自他炮制的反动的《修养》。这些组织的红卫兵都认为，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派伙同党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，抛出资产阶级反动路线来压制、打击革命派战士，又利用资产阶级反动路线来挑起革命派之间的“内战”，妄图扑灭革命的烈火，转移斗争的大方向，使他们的一小撮混过关去。我们千万不能上当，一定要集中火力，把枪口对准党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。通过大批判，这个学校的革命小将有了联合的政治基础和思想基础。
    上海市第六女中革命小将在革命的大批判中实现大联合的经验发表之后，给金陵中学革命红卫兵极大的鼓舞。他们组织同学学习报纸上发表的报道和社论，到市六女中去取经，虚心向市六女中革命红卫兵学习。通过学习，这些红卫兵组织从团结的愿望出发，展开了批评与自我批评。许多班级还开会揭发、批判、控诉党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他提出的资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行，共同把矛头指向中国的赫鲁晓夫和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。会上，大家回忆了过去革命造反的历史，回忆资产阶级反动路线对自己的迫害，畅谈了当前全国和上海的大好形势，激起了强烈的政治责任感和更旺盛的革命精神，对党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派也更加仇恨了。他们表示，我们是毛主席的红卫兵，最听毛主席的话，一定要在这次大批判运动中，活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，继续发扬猛冲猛打的精神，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派批臭批倒。现在，向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的总攻击开始了，新的、更艰巨的任务就在面前。为什么我们还要打“内战”，削弱自己的力量呢？不少革命小将说：我们之间争论的问题，无论如何没有斗争党内头号走资本主义道路当权派更重要。他们说，无产阶级革命派联合起来的理由有千条万条，找不出半条理由打
  “内战”，闹分裂。他们遵循毛主席关于“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要”的教导，决心以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，在毛泽东思想的基础上，在革命的大批判中联合起来，团结起来。
    许多班级的红卫兵通过批判资产阶级反动路线，消除了隔阂，增强了团结，纷纷建立统一的红卫兵小队。有些年级建立了红卫兵纵队，全校成立了红卫兵大联合筹备处，准备建立全校性的统一的革命红卫兵组织。他们说，毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”当前正是无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的关键时刻，我们一定要顾全大局，求大同，存小异，团结全校革命师生，高举革命的批判旗帜，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派批臭、批倒，并且把对他的批判和学校的斗、批、改任务结合起来，彻底斩断他伸向学校的黑手，肃清他在学校里的恶劣影响，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！　（新华社）
