The British imperialists, in collusion with American imperialism, attempted to use the United Nations and the "UN Peacekeeping Forces" to suppress the South Yemeni people's struggle for national liberation. However, the so-called "UN delegation" had barely set foot on South Yemeni soil when they were driven out by the South Yemeni people. The South Yemeni people's revolutionary action is excellent!

Chairman Mao said: "We must have a clear head, which includes not believing the 'sweet talk' of imperialism and not fearing imperialist threats."

The South Yemeni people are doing exactly this.

In the face of British imperialist military suppression, the South Yemeni people are fearless. They firmly believe that as long as they persist in armed struggle, they can defeat imperialism and its lackeys. Against British imperialist political deception, the South Yemeni people will not fall for it. They firmly believe that only by persisting in armed struggle can they achieve true independence and complete national liberation.

In the conspiracy of American and British imperialism to use the United Nations to suppress the South Yemeni people's struggle, the Soviet revisionist clique played a very unsavory role. It not only voted to send a "UN delegation" to South Yemen but also shamelessly boasted that the "UN forces" were a "peacekeeping force" to "protect young independent nations." This is sheer nonsense. The South Yemeni people still remember the tragedy of the Congo (Leopoldville), how could they allow it to be repeated in South Yemen!

The South Yemeni people drove out the "UN delegation," greatly diminishing the arrogance of imperialism and revisionism and greatly boosting the morale of revolutionary people. The leader of the South Yemen Liberation Front, Makawi, said well: The brave South Yemeni revolutionary people are not to be conquered by the British imperialist army, nor deceived by any enemy plots. The South Yemeni people are determined to carry the revolutionary struggle for national liberation to the end. The final victory will surely belong to the South Yemeni people.

    大灭帝修的威风
    英帝国主义勾结美帝国主义，妄图利用联合国和“联合国维持和平部队”来扑灭南也门人民争取民族解放的斗争。但是，所谓“联合国代表团”踏上南也门的土地，立足未稳，就被南也门人民轰出去了。南也门人民这个革命行动好得很！
    毛主席说：“我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”
    南也门人民正是这样做的。
    对英帝国主义的武力镇压，南也门人民毫不畏惧。他们坚信，只要坚持武装斗争，就能打败帝国主义及其走狗。对英帝国主义的政治欺骗，南也门人民决不上当。他们坚信，只有坚持武装斗争，才能获得真正的独立和彻底的民族解放。
    在美英帝国主义利用联合国镇压南也门人民斗争的阴谋中，苏修集团扮演了一个极不光采的角色。它不但投票同意向南也门派出“联合国代表团”，而且无耻吹嘘“联合国部队”是什么
  “保护年轻独立国家”的“和平部队”。这完全是胡说八道。南也门人民对刚果（利）悲剧记忆犹新，怎会容许它在南也门重演！
    南也门人民赶走“联合国代表团”，大灭帝国主义和修正主义的威风，大长革命人民的志气。南也门解放阵线领导人马卡维说得好：英勇的南也门革命人民，是英帝国主义的军队征服不了的，是敌人的任何阴谋欺骗不了的。南也门人民决心把争取民族解放的革命斗争进行到底。最后胜利一定是属于南也门人民的。
