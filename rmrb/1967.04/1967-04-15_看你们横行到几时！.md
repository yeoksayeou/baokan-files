Another outrage! Another blood debt!

Following the serious incidents in March where the Indonesian reactionaries instigated killings and injuries of Chinese nationals in Malang and Cirebon, on April 6, the military authorities in the city of Kediri in East Java, once again brazenly deployed troops to brutally shoot at the families of detained compatriots who had come to visit them. Our innocent compatriot Huang Jianmin was shot dead, while compatriots Yang Jingrong and Chen Yongzhen were injured; two Chinese nationals who rushed forward to rescue them were savagely beaten, left unconscious, and then dragged into the dark prison....

The blood of the martyrs, bright red, is before our eyes. Our eyes are ablaze, our lungs are about to burst with rage! Indonesian reactionaries, this blood debt, you must repay!

The Indonesian reactionaries' frenzied massacre of our compatriots only shows that they are a group of desperate, wildly struggling, extremely brutal beasts.

Since the right-wing military clique in Indonesia launched a counter-revolutionary coup in October 1965, the Indonesian reactionaries have been acting recklessly at home, committing all sorts of evil deeds, and establishing a barefaced fascist dictatorship. Tens of thousands of Indonesian patriotic people have been slaughtered, and tens of thousands of Chinese nationals have been cruelly persecuted. The beautiful archipelago is drenched in blood; the fertile land of Indonesia is impoverished and exhausted.... Suffering, heavy suffering, weighs heavily on the heads of the Indonesian people. The unquenchable fire of revolution and the serious economic crisis have made the Indonesian reactionaries like ants on a hot stove. To prop up their shaky reactionary rule and to win rewards from American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership, the Indonesian reactionaries are willing to act as the vanguard of anti-China forces.

The Indonesian reactionaries are rampantly persecuting and suppressing Chinese nationals, waving the banner of "defending national interests" and slandering Chinese nationals as monopolizing and controlling the Indonesian economy. This is a complete reversal of right and wrong, sheer nonsense. Generation after generation of hardworking Chinese nationals living in Indonesia have, together with the Indonesian people, shed blood and sweat in long years of labor and struggle, making great contributions to Indonesia's national independence and the development of its national economy. Those who monopolize and control the Indonesian economy are not others, but you, this small clique of national traitors and your imperialist masters. On the one hand, you brutally persecute the broad masses of Chinese nationals who play a positive role in the development of Indonesia's national economy, and on the other hand, you open the door wide for imperialist monopoly capital, even announcing the return of imperialist enterprises, which the Indonesian people have already seized and confiscated in their anti-imperialist struggle, to your masters. You are the slaves of imperialism, a gang of traitors!

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The broad masses of Chinese nationals in Indonesia, remembering the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, armed with Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon, defend the dignity of the motherland and uphold national dignity. They are invincible against any reactionary forces. The broad masses of Chinese nationals, unarmed, with Mao Zedong Thought, are unyielding and fearless. The more you persecute, the more you provoke the resistance of our patriotic compatriots. The struggle of Chinese nationals against persecution is completely just and will certainly be victorious.

To our compatriots who bravely defend the dignity of the motherland, we, the Red Guards of the motherland armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, salute you! Fight bravely, the powerful motherland is your strong support, the Red Guards and the people of the motherland are your steadfast rear guard!

Indonesian reactionaries, listen! The Chinese Red Guards, who are charging forward in the great proletarian cultural revolution that is shaking the world, have long seen through your paper tiger's weak nature. Your masters—American imperialism and Soviet revisionism—such giants, we do not fear, and you are merely a disgraceful lackey of American and Soviet imperialism in the anti-China chorus, adding how much weight! But we must sternly warn you: blood debts must be repaid.

History will surely punish you, this small clique of anti-China clowns.

See how long you can rampage!

    看你们横行到几时！

    又是一次暴行！又是一笔血债！
    印尼反动派继三月间在玛琅、谏义里等地策动一起又一起杀伤华侨，逼死人命的严重事件之后，四月六日，东爪哇西都文罗市军政当局，又悍然出动军队，疯狂扫射前往探望被非法逮捕的难侨的家属。我无辜侨胞黄健民被枪杀，侨胞杨荆荣、陈永振被击伤；赶上前抢救他们的两名华侨惨遭毒打，昏厥后被拖进黑暗的监狱……。
    血，受难烈士鲜红鲜红的血，如在眼前。我们的眼睛喷火，我们的肺都要气炸了！印尼反动派，这笔血债，你们非还不可！
    印尼反动派疯狂屠杀我们的侨胞，这只能说明他们是一群走投无路、绝望挣扎的极其残暴的野兽。
    自从一九六五年十月印尼右派军人集团发动反革命政变以来，印尼反动派在国内倒行逆施，无恶不作，建立了赤裸裸的法西斯专政。几十万印尼爱国人民惨遭屠杀，成千上万的华侨遭到残酷迫害。美丽的千岛之国，血流遍野；富饶的印尼大地，民穷财尽。……苦难，沉重的苦难，紧紧地压在印尼人民头上。扑不灭的革命之火和严重的经济危机，使印尼反动派犹如热锅上的蚂蚁。为了支撑其岌岌可危的反动统治，换取美帝国主义和苏修领导集团的犒赏，印尼反动派甘心充当一名反华的急先锋。
    印尼反动派猖狂地迫害和镇压华侨，打起所谓“维护民族利益”的破旗，诬蔑华侨垄断和控制了印尼的经济。这完全是颠倒黑白，胡说八道。世世代代旅居印尼的广大劳苦华侨，同印尼人民在长期的劳动和斗争中一起流血流汗，为印尼的民族独立和民族经济的发展，作出了很大的贡献。垄断和控制印尼经济的，不是别人，正是你们这一小撮印尼的民族败类和你们的主子帝国主义。你们一方面残酷迫害对发展印尼民族经济起积极作用的广大华侨，一方面为帝国主义垄断资本大开方便之门，甚至宣布把印尼人民在反帝斗争中已经接管和没收的帝国主义企业拱手奉还给你们的主子。你们是帝国主义的奴才，是一伙卖国求荣的蟊贼！
    有压迫必然有反抗。印尼广大的华侨，牢记我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，以毛泽东思想为强大武器，维护祖国尊严，坚持民族气节，他们是任何反动势力所压服不了的。手无寸铁的广大华侨，有了毛泽东思想，是压不倒、吓不了的。你们越是疯狂迫害，就越是激起我爱国侨胞的反抗。华侨的反迫害斗争，是完全正义的，是一定要胜利的。
    英勇地维护祖国尊严的我爱国侨胞们，我们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的祖国红卫兵，向你们致敬！英勇地斗争吧，强大的祖国是你们的坚强靠山，祖国的红卫兵和祖国人民，誓作你们坚强的后盾！
    印尼反动派，你们听着！在震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵、所向披靡的中国红卫兵，早就看透了你们纸老虎的虚弱本质。你们的主子——美帝和苏修这样的庞然大物，我们也不放在眼里，而你们只不过是美帝、苏修的一个可耻的走卒，在反华大合唱中又能够增加多少分量！但是，我们要严厉地警告你们：血债是一定要偿还的。
    历史必将惩罚你们这一小撮反华的小丑们。
    且看你们横行到几时！
