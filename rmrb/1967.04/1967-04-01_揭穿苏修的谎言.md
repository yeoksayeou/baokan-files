On March 27, the official mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionists, Tass, fabricated a ridiculous "myth" claiming that the Red Guards of Tsinghua University's Jian'gangshan Brigade in Beijing's western suburbs intercepted a car carrying a group of Soviet diplomats in the Summer Palace, and that the Soviet diplomats were surrounded by a mob for six and a half hours. The Red Guards demanded an apology from the Soviet diplomats "for no reason" and tried to overturn the car and push it into a ditch, and so on. Immediately, the American imperialists' rumor mill, the United Press International, spread this "myth." The Soviet revisionists and American imperialists sang in unison, viciously slandering the Chinese Red Guards.

Lies are always lies. Although the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is skilled at spreading rumors, they cannot cover up the ironclad facts with lies.

On the afternoon of March 26, at around 3 PM, on the road near Yuquanshan in the western suburbs of the capital, a black sedan violated traffic rules, recklessly driving and cutting in from the right, colliding with a jeep in front that was turning. After the accident, the sedan tried to drive away. Four Red Guards from Tsinghua University's Jian'gangshan Brigade who were passing by went forward to reason with them, asking the foreigners in the sedan about their nationality and demanding an apology. These foreigners not only refused to answer but also started the engine, attempting to forcefully disperse the crowd gathered at the scene. What was even more despicable was that these foreigners also played the hooligan, saying, "Do you want money? We have money, we have money!" At the same time, they threw candies out of the car, deliberately insulting our Red Guards. We were puzzled, wondering where these imperialist scoundrels came from. Later, we found out that they were Soviet revisionist diplomats. Their hooligan behavior could not help but provoke the indignation of the crowd at the scene. When the traffic police arrived at the scene to investigate, they found out that the culprits were the second secretary of the Soviet Embassy in China, Berisov, and others. The traffic police, following normal procedures, drew a scene diagram and asked the Soviet culprits to sign it, but they refused to sign. This dragged on for more than six hours. Only then did they sign and admit their mistake in the face of ironclad facts. This is the entire sequence of events.

The Soviet revisionist rumor mill used its usual tricks to distort the facts, using this incident to write anti-China articles, viciously attacking the Chinese Red Guards and revolutionary masses, which is utterly shameless!

The Soviet revisionist diplomats on Chinese territory, driving recklessly and violating traffic rules, caused an accident. The Chinese Red Guards merely asked them to apologize, and the Chinese traffic police merely asked them to sign the scene investigation diagram. Isn't this the most basic requirement? The era when imperialist scoundrels could do as they pleased and act arrogantly on Chinese soil has long passed. Today, Soviet diplomats still want to show off their stinky imperialist arrogance in front of the Chinese people? Isn't that a dream?

The Soviet revisionists dared to use money and candies to insult our revolutionary youngsters, which is a serious provocation to our Red Guards!

The purpose of Tass's distortion of facts and fabrication of lies is to deceive the Soviet people, incite anti-China sentiments, and sabotage the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. This is a despicable method consistently used by the Soviet revisionist leadership. However, the evil intentions of the Soviet revisionist leadership will never succeed. The Chinese people and the Chinese Red Guards are friendly to the Soviet people. What we oppose is the small clique of traitors and scabs within the Soviet revisionist leadership who have betrayed the great Lenin and the great Soviet people. Any attempt by this small clique of traitors to sow discord between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union will be exposed by the Soviet people.

The slanderous rumors spread by Tass reflect the Soviet revisionist leadership's extreme fear and deep hatred of the vanguard of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution—the Chinese Red Guards. From the day the Red Guards were born, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from all countries have never stopped their vicious slander, attacks, and curses against us. Chairman Mao taught us, "If the enemy vigorously opposes us, vilifies us, and says we are utterly worthless, then it is even better. It not only means that we have drawn a clear line with the enemy but also proves that our work has been very successful." Imperialists curse us, the traitors of the Soviet revisionists curse us, and reactionaries from all countries curse us. This is the greatest honor for us Red Guards. The Soviet revisionist leadership uses Tass's rumors to slander us, which does not harm the glorious image of the Chinese Red Guards in the slightest but only exposes the shameful face of the Soviet revisionist rumor-mongers once again!

    揭穿苏修的谎言
    清华大学井冈山兵团红卫兵
    三月二十七日，苏修官方喉舌塔斯社编造了一个荒诞无稽的“神话”，说什么清华大学井冈山红卫兵在北京市郊的颐和园“截住了乘有一批苏联外交官员的汽车”，“苏联外交官在胡作非为的人群中被围达六个半小时”，红卫兵“莫名其妙地”要苏联外交官“道歉”，并且“想把汽车打翻，推进水沟里”，等等。接着，美帝国主义的造谣机器合众国际社马上就传播了这个“神话”。苏修和美帝一唱一和，对中国红卫兵进行了恶毒的诬蔑。
    谎言总归是谎言。尽管苏修叛徒集团是造谣的“里手”，但是，妄图用造谣来掩盖铁的事实，这是绝对办不到的。
    三月二十六日下午三时，首都西郊的玉泉山路上，一辆黑色小轿车违反交通规则，横冲直撞，强行右侧超车，撞坏了前面正在拐弯的一辆中吉普。那辆小轿车在肇事后，企图溜走了事。路过这里的四名清华大学井冈山红卫兵上前评理，询问肇事的小轿车上的外国人是哪个国籍的，并要求他们赔礼道歉。这几个外国人不仅拒不回答，而且开动马达，企图蛮横地冲散聚集在现场的群众。尤其恶劣的是，这几个外国人还对红卫兵大耍流氓，说什么“你们要金钱吗？我们有金钱，我们有金钱！”同时，他们还从车内向外扔糖果，蓄意侮辱我们红卫兵。我们心里正纳闷，哪里来的这几个铜臭熏天的帝国主义分子。后来才了解到，原来是苏修的外交官。他们的流氓行为，不能不激起在场群众的愤慨。当我交通民警赶到现场，进行调查，查明这些肇事者原来是苏联驻华使馆二等秘书柏里所夫等人。我交通民警按正常手续，绘制现场图，并要求苏修肇事者在图上签字，但他们又耍赖，拒不签字。就这样，一直拖延了六个多小时。之后，他们才在铁的事实面前签字认错。这就是事情发生的全部经过。苏修造谣社使出惯用的伎俩，歪曲事实真相，利用这件事来大作反华文章，恶毒攻击中国红卫兵和革命群众，简直无耻到了极点！
    苏修的外交官在中国的领土上，驾着汽车横冲直撞，违反交通规则，闯了车祸，中国红卫兵仅仅要你们赔礼道歉，中国交通民警仅仅要你们在现场调查图上签字，这不是最起码的要求吗？帝国主义分子在中国的领土上为所欲为、横行霸道的时代早已一去不复返了。今天，苏修外交官竟然还要在中国人民面前抖起当年帝国主义分子的臭威风，岂不是梦想吗？
    苏联修正主义分子竟敢用金钱和糖果来侮辱我国革命小将，是对我国红卫兵的严重挑衅！
    塔斯社颠倒黑白、编造谎言的卑鄙目的，就是为了欺骗苏联人民，煽动反华情绪，破坏中苏两国人民的友谊。这是苏修领导集团一贯使用的卑劣手法。但是，苏修领导集团的这种罪恶企图是绝对不会得逞的。中国人民和中国红卫兵对苏联人民是友好的。我们反对的，只是背叛伟大列宁、背叛伟大苏联人民的苏修领导集团这一小撮彻底叛徒和彻底工贼。这一小撮叛徒在中苏两国人民之间进行的任何挑拨离间的阴谋，都将被苏联人民所识破。
    塔斯社的造谣诬蔑，表现了苏修领导集团对中国无产阶级文化大革命中的闯将——中国红卫兵万分恐惧和刻骨仇恨。从我们红卫兵诞生的第一天起，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派从来就没有停止过对我们红卫兵的恶毒诬蔑、攻击和咒骂。毛主席教导我们：“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”帝国主义骂我们，苏修这一伙叛徒骂我们，各国反动派骂我们，这是我们红卫兵的莫大光荣。苏修领导集团通过塔斯社的造谣来诬蔑我们，丝毫无损于中国红卫兵的光辉形象，只能再一次暴露苏修造谣者的可耻面目！
