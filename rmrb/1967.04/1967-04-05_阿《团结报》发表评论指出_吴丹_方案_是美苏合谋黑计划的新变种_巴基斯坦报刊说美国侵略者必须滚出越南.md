New York Times, Tirana, April 2 -- The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on April 2 stating that the so-called "three-point proposal" put forward by UN Secretary-General U Thant to resolve the Vietnam issue is a new variant of the schemes plotted in the White House and jointly approved by the "sacred alliance" of the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

The commentary pointed out that U Thant's "three-point proposal" has been enthusiastically welcomed by U.S. imperialism. The British Foreign Secretary immediately expressed, "Britain agrees to cooperate with U Thant to implement the plan to achieve peace in Vietnam."

The commentary said that whether it is U.S. imperialism or the Khrushchev revisionists, they have all miscalculated. The Vietnamese people are holding high the banner of victory, and the U.S. aggressors are sinking deeper and deeper into the abyss of doom. Facing the strategic and tactical methods of the people's war, the strategic and tactical methods of U.S. imperialism are in a state of utter defeat. Similarly, the "peace talks" deception loudly shouted by the imperialists and their lackeys has been smashed and exposed.

New York Times, Rawalpindi, April 4 -- The Pakistani newspaper "Construction Daily" published an editorial on April 3 stating that the so-called "new plan" proposed by UN Secretary-General U Thant to resolve the Vietnam issue ignores the U.S.'s aggressive crimes and equates the U.S. aggressors with the Vietnamese people who are fighting for their own liberation.

The editorial said that if one does not face the fact that the U.S. is playing the role of an aggressor, then all so-called proposals aimed at stopping the Vietnam War will mean supporting the U.S. aggressors.

The editorial pointed out: "The Vietnamese people's war against U.S. aggression is a war for national independence. If this fundamental point is ignored, it will be impossible to distinguish between the aggressor country and the country being aggressed."

The editorial expressed support for the Vietnamese people's struggle for liberation. The editorial also pointed out that the U.S. and its accomplices are criminals who invade Vietnam and use force to achieve their aggressive purposes, and these criminals can only be countered with force.

The latest issue of the Karachi "Sunday Mail" also published an editorial condemning U Thant's "new plan."

The editorial said: "The U.S. military has no reason to stay in Vietnam. The U.S. bombing of North Vietnam has caused widespread destruction of civilian lives and property, which is naked aggression. The Vietnamese people have no choice but to fight against this aggression."

The editorial emphasized: "The Americans are completely invaders of Vietnam, and they must get out of Vietnam."

    阿《团结报》发表评论指出
    吴丹“方案”是美苏合谋黑计划的新变种
    巴基斯坦报刊说美国侵略者必须滚出越南
    新华社地拉那二日电  阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二日发表短评说，联合国秘书长吴丹就解决越南问题提出的所谓“三点建议”，是在白宫策划出来、并且得到苏美“神圣同盟”联合批准的这类计划的新变种。
    短评指出，吴丹的“三点建议”得到美帝国主义的热烈欢迎。英国外交大臣也马上表示，“英国同意与吴丹去苏联合作执行实现越南和平的计划”。
    短评说，不管是美帝国主义者，还是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者都打错了算盘。越南人民高举胜利的旗帜，美国侵略者越来越深地陷入灭顶之灾。面对着人民战争的战略战术，美帝国主义的战略战术正在惨败。同样，帝国主义者及其仆从大叫大嚷的“和谈”骗局也被粉碎、被戳穿了。
    新华社拉瓦尔品第四日电　巴基斯坦拉瓦尔品第《建设报》三日发表社论说，联合国秘书长吴丹提出的所谓解决越南问题的“新方案”，无视美国的侵略罪行，把美国侵略者同为争取自身解放而战斗的越南人民相提并论。
    社论说，如果不正视美国充当侵略者的角色这个事实，那么一切旨在停止越南战争的所谓建议，都将意味着是对美国侵略者的支持。
    社论指出：“越南人民反对美国侵略的战争，是越南人民的民族独立战争。如果忽视这个基本点，就无法区别侵略国和被侵略国了。”
    社论表示支持越南人民为争取解放而进行斗争。社论还指出，美国及其帮凶是侵略越南和使用武力来达到侵略目的的罪犯，对这些罪犯，只能用武力来还击。
    卡拉奇《星期日邮报》最近一期也发表社论谴责吴丹的“新方案”。
    社论说：“美军没有理由赖在越南，美国轰炸北越，使和平居民的生命财产遭受到广泛破坏，这是赤裸裸的侵略行为，越南人民不得不为反对这种侵略而斗争。”
    社论强调指出：“美国佬完全是越南的入侵者，他们必须滚出越南。”
