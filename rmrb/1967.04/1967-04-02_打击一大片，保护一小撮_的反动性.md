"Striking a large area, protecting a few" is a part of the bourgeois reactionary line. Those who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line, in order to shield a small number of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, want to suppress the vigorous proletarian cultural revolution mass movement. In the matter of cadres, they implement the reactionary policy of "striking a large area, protecting a few." This is fundamentally opposed to and completely in conflict with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses. Our great leader Chairman Mao most believes in the masses, most understands the masses, and most supports the masses' revolutionary movement. He is always in tune with the revolutionary masses. He has always believed that the vast majority of cadres are revolutionary. Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to the role of cadres in the revolutionary cause. As early as more than twenty years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." "We must be good at identifying cadres," "We must be good at using cadres," "We must be good at cherishing cadres." At the same time, Chairman Mao taught us: "Communist Party members should not take an exclusionary attitude towards those who have made mistakes in their work, except for those who are beyond redemption, but should take an attitude of persuasion, making them change for the better and discard the old to pursue the new." In 1965, Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the Twenty-three Articles, which clearly pointed out that the majority of cadres are good or relatively good; efforts should be made to gradually unite more than ninety-five percent of the cadres; for cadres who have made mistakes, the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" should be implemented, with the focus on striking a small number of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. The Sixteen Articles, which Chairman Mao also personally presided over, are imbued with this spirit. Chairman Mao's cadre policy is completely in line with China's objective reality. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has always been dominant in the party and the country. The vast majority of cadres have walked the socialist road and struggled for the socialist cause under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; only a small number have insisted on taking the capitalist road. Chairman Mao's cadre policy is the only correct policy of Marxism-Leninism, and it is an integral part of our party's long-standing proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

However, the biggest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road has always done the opposite. They invert the enemy-people relationship, taking the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres as the objects of attack, and striving to protect a small number of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. They attempt to use the reactionary policy of "striking a large area, protecting a few" to oppose Chairman Mao's correct policy of uniting the majority and striking a few, and to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the matter of cadres, the struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line has been long-standing. As early as the land reform and party rectification movements during the War of Liberation, the proposers of the bourgeois reactionary line opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and vigorously promoted the "striking a large area, protecting a few" approach. They did not distinguish between right and wrong, did not conduct class analysis, and portrayed cadres as a black mass, claiming that they had all "degenerated," and engaged in what they called "moving stones," "universal and merciless struggle," kicking out a large number of revolutionary cadres, and even detaining them. This seriously struck at the revolutionary cadres. Chairman Mao's "Speech at the Jin-Sui Cadres Conference" thoroughly criticized their erroneous line, thereby ensuring the victory of the land reform and party rectification movements.

In 1964, during the socialist education movement, the few who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line also promoted the "striking a large area, protecting a few" approach, appearing left but actually right. They distorted the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between the two roads during the transitional period, into the "contradiction between the four cleans and the four uncleans," "the intertwining of contradictions between the party and outside the party," "the intertwining of contradictions between the enemy and the people," and so on. They regarded the broad revolutionary cadres as "enemies," kicked them out, and used methods of struggle against the enemy to "slowly fry the fish, peel layer by layer." As a result, the direction of the struggle was diverted, the majority of cadres and some members were struck at, and a small number of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road were shielded. At this crucial moment, Chairman Mao timely discovered and criticized their erroneous line, personally presided over the formulation of the Twenty-three Articles, corrected the course, and led the movement back to the path of healthy development.

In this unprecedented great proletarian cultural revolution, they have not changed their nature and stubbornly stood on the bourgeois reactionary position, even more vigorously promoting the bourgeois reactionary line. They sent out a large number of work teams, instructing the work teams and the conservative organizations they controlled to, on the one hand, strike at the revolutionary masses, labeling the revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," and on the other hand, strike at the broad revolutionary cadres, labeling a large number of good or relatively good cadres as "black gangs."

"Striking a large area, protecting a few" is thoroughly anti-Mao Zedong Thought, fundamentally opposed to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and extremely reactionary.

Firstly, it opposes the revolution and obstructs the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary forces. Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." With power, there is everything. Losing power means losing everything. The proletarian cultural revolution is to rebel against the bourgeoisie and seize power from a small number of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. However, the biggest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, in order to save his failing fate, resorted to the trick of "striking a large area, protecting a few." They muddied the waters, confused the class lines. They attempted to both strike at the proletarian power-holders and overthrow the proletarian revolutionary government; and to shield the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, obstructing the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary forces. How poisonous!

Secondly, it inverts the enemy-people relationship, shifts the target, and protects a small number of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. The Sixteen Articles point out: "The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres are the main force of this cultural revolution," "The focus of this movement is to rectify those power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road." However, the proposers of the bourgeois reactionary line did the opposite. They used the counter-revolutionary trick of "striking a large area, protecting a few" to shift the struggle's target from the power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road to the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. Whoever dared to rebel against them, they immediately labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," killing one to warn a hundred; whoever dared to stand up and expose their crimes, they regarded as monsters, shooting the outspoken, labeling them with hats of "ambitious plotter," "political swindler," "three-anti elements"; whoever knew their secrets, they regarded as hidden dangers, catching them off guard, labeling them as "black gangs," attempting to "kill to silence." They struck at the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres "in large areas," while striving to "vouch for" a small number of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, "open back doors," letting them slip away, protecting them all.

Thirdly, it isolates the proletarian revolutionary forces and sabotages the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The proletarian cultural revolution is the revolutionary cause of the people. Only by relying on the majority of the masses, relying on the majority of cadres, and organizing a vast cultural revolution army, can we drive a small number of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road to a narrow and isolated position and annihilate them. In contrast, the "striking a large area, protecting a few" reactionary policy promoted by the few who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line is to strike at the "vast" proletarian revolutionary forces, isolating the proletarian revolutionary forces. They, on the one hand, incited the masses to struggle against cadres, and on the other hand, incited cadres to struggle against the masses, attempting to kill two birds with one stone, both struggling against the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary cadres. They attempted to make cadres unable to stand up for the revolution, to make the relationship between cadres and the masses seriously opposed, in order to achieve the evil purpose of sabotaging the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

Now, a small number of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are attempting to pin the crime of "overthrowing everything" on the revolutionary youngsters, on the proletarian revolutionary forces. This is sheer delusion. The proletarian revolutionary forces have always firmly opposed "overthrowing everything." We only want to overthrow a small number, that is, the power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities." At the same time, we firmly defend the proletarian headquarters and protect the power-holders who are taking the socialist road and all revolutionary cadres. Even for cadres who have made mistakes, we view them dialectically, firmly implementing Chairman Mao's traditional policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient."

At present, a small number of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, either disguised and sharp-witted, trying to infiltrate the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership cadre, to achieve capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration; or pretending to care about cadres, stirring up the relationship between cadres and revolutionary youngsters, stirring up the relationship between cadres and the proletarian headquarters, attempting to exclude genuine revolutionary cadres, sabotaging the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." All of these are the desperate struggles of the class enemy. Cadres and revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought will definitely see through their tricks and smash their plots. All cadres who have been persecuted and struck at by the bourgeois reactionary line will definitely smash the spiritual shackles of "Cultivation," bravely stand up, rebel against the bourgeois reactionary line, rebel against a small number of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary forces, stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and make new contributions to the great proletarian cultural revolution!

    “打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动性
    毛泽东思想哲学社会科学部　红卫兵联队
    “打击一大片，保护一小撮”，是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分。提出资产阶级反动路线的那几个人，为了包庇党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，要把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动打下去，在干部问题上实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策。这是同毛主席的革命路线根本对立，完全对抗的。
    毛主席的革命路线，就是相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众的路线。我们的伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，最了解群众，最支持群众的革命运动，和革命群众心连心。他始终相信绝大多数干部是要革命的。毛主席一直很重视干部在革命事业中的作用。毛主席早在二十多年前就指出：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素”。“必须善于识别干部”，“必须善于使用干部”，“必须善于爱护干部”。同时，毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对于在工作中犯过错误的人们，除了不可救药者外，不是采取排斥态度，而是采取规劝态度，使之翻然改进，弃旧图新。”一九六五年，毛主席亲自主持制定的二十三条明确指出，大多数干部是好的和比较好的；要逐步做到团结百分之九十五以上的干部；对犯错误的干部要实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，重点是打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条，也贯串着这个精神。毛主席的干部政策，是完全符合我国客观实际情况的。毛主席的革命路线一直在全党、全国占统治地位，大多数的干部都是在毛主席的革命路线的光辉照耀下走社会主义道路、为社会主义事业而奋斗的；坚持走资本主义道路的，只是一小撮。毛主席的干部政策是马克思列宁主义的唯一正确的政策，是我们党长期来以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的有机组成部分。
    可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，总是反其道而行之。他们颠倒敌我关系，把广大革命群众和革命干部作为打击的对象，极力保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。他们妄图以“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，对抗毛主席的团结大多数，打击一小撮的正确政策，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    在干部问题上，毛主席的革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的斗争是由来已久的。早在解放战争时期的土改和整党运动中，资产阶级反动路线的提出者，就反对毛主席的革命路线，竭力推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”那一套。他们不分青红皂白，不作阶级分析，把干部描写得一团漆黑，说成统统“蜕变了”，大搞什么“搬石头”，“普遍的、无情的斗争”，把大批革命干部踢开，甚至关押起来。这就严重打击了革命干部。毛主席《在晋绥干部会议上的讲话》，彻底地批判了他们的错误路线，从而保证土改和整党运动的胜利。
    一九六四年，在社会主义教育运动中，提出资产阶级反动路线的几个人，也是搞的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”形“左”实右的那一套。他们把过渡时期无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，歪曲为“四清和四不清的矛盾”，“党内外矛盾的交叉”，“敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的交叉”，等等。他们把广大革命干部看成“敌人”，把他们一脚踢开，用对敌斗争的办法，“慢火煎鱼，层层剥皮”。结果，转移了斗争的大方向，打击了大多数干部和部分社员群众，包庇了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。在这个重要关头，毛主席及时发现并批判了他们的错误路线，亲自主持制定了二十三条，拨正了航向，把运动引上了健康发展的道路。
    在这场史无前例的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们本性难移，顽固地站在资产阶级反动立场上，变本加厉地推行资产阶级反动路线。他们派出大量工作组，指使工作组和他们所操纵的保守组织，一方面打击革命群众，把革命群众打成“反革命”，另一方面打击广大革命干部，把大批好的或比较好的干部打成“黑帮”。
    “打击一大片，保护一小撮”，是彻头彻尾反毛泽东思想的，是根本对抗毛主席的革命路线的，是极其反动的。
    首先，它反对革命，阻止无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”有了政权，就有了一切。丧失政权，就丧失了一切。无产阶级文化大革命，就是要造资产阶级的反，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，为了挽救自己失败的命运，祭起了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的法宝。把水搅得浑浑的，把阶级阵线打得乱乱的。他们妄图既打击无产阶级当权派，颠覆无产阶级革命政权；又掩护走资本主义道路当权派，阻止无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。真是何其毒也！
    其次，它颠倒敌我，转移目标，保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。十六条指出：“广大的工农兵、革命的知识分子和革命的干部，是这场文化大革命的主力军”，“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。”可是，资产阶级反动路线的提出者，完全反其道而行之。他们用“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反革命伎俩，把斗争的矛头从党内走资本主义道路当权派身上，转移到广大革命群众和革命干部身上。谁敢于造他们的反，他们就把他当作眼中钉，立即打成“反革命”，杀一儆百；谁敢于站出来揭他们的罪行，他们就视为洪水猛兽，枪打出头鸟，给他加上“野心家”，“政治扒手”，“三反分子”的帽子；谁知道他们的内情，他们就看作隐患祸根，出其不意，把他打成“黑帮”，妄图“杀人灭口”。他们“一大片、一大片”地打击革命群众和革命干部，而却竭力为党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派“打保票”，“开后门”，让其溜之乎也，统统保护起来。
    再次，它孤立无产阶级革命派，破坏革命的“三结合”。无产阶级文化大革命，是人民群众自己的革命事业。只有依靠大多数群众，依靠大多数干部，组织起浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，才能把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，驱逐到狭小的孤立的阵地上去，聚而歼之。与此相反，提出资产阶级反动路线的几个人所推行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，则是为了把无产阶级革命派的“浩浩荡荡”打掉，以孤立无产阶级革命派。他们一方面挑动群众斗干部，一方面挑动干部整群众，企图一箭双雕，既整了革命群众，又整了革命干部。他们企图使干部不能站出来革命，使干部和群众的关系严重对立，以达到破坏革命的“三结合”的罪恶目的。
    现在，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，又企图把“打倒一切”的罪名，强加在革命小将头上，强加在无产阶级革命派头上。这完全是痴心妄想。无产阶级革命派从来就是坚决反对“打倒一切”的。我们要打倒的只是一小撮，即党内走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”。同时，我们坚决保卫无产阶级司令部，保护走社会主义道路的当权派和一切革命干部。即使对于犯错误的干部，我们也是一分为二地看待，坚决执行毛主席的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的传统政策。
    当前，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，或者乔装打扮，削尖脑袋，拉拢收买，妄图钻进革命的“三结合”的领导班子，实现资本主义反革命复辟；或者装出一副关心干部的样子，挑拨干部同革命小将的关系，挑拨干部同无产阶级司令部的关系，企图排斥真正的革命干部，破坏革命的“三结合”。这一切都是阶级敌人的垂死挣扎。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命干部和革命群众，一定能识破他们的诡计，粉碎他们的阴谋。一切受资产阶级反动路线迫害和打击的干部，一定能砸烂《修养》的精神枷锁，勇敢地站起来，造资产阶级反动路线的反，造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，坚决地站在无产阶级革命派一边，站在毛主席的革命路线一边，为无产阶级文化大革命作出新的贡献！
