The Soviet revisionist leadership clique headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin has recently taken advantage of the opportunity of the Seventh Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to make a lot of noise on the Vietnamese issue, rabidly anti-China, saying that the reason their aid to Vietnam cannot be "more effective" is because China opposes their "united action."

At this congress, the faithful followers of Soviet revisionism, such as Ulbricht, also joined in the shouting, slandering China.

The Soviet revisionist clique has once again hoisted the tattered banner of so-called "united action," which is sufficient to show that they are at their wits' end. The shameful face of these few big traitors and big scoundrels in the Soviet revisionist clique is becoming increasingly clear on the Vietnamese issue. They want to use the hackneyed phrase of "united action" to cover up their heinous crimes, which is absolutely impossible.

As early as the time of Khrushchev's rule, the Soviet revisionist clique betrayed the Vietnamese people, colluded with U.S. imperialism on the Vietnamese issue, and encouraged U.S. imperialism to invade Vietnam. Now, they have gone even further, not only encouraging but also doing everything possible to help U.S. imperialism extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle.

Let us look at the facts.

Just as Brezhnev and Kosygin took office, they could not wait to collude with U.S. imperialism and betray Vietnam.

In January 1965, the Soviet government, following the orders of the United States, conveyed the American demand that the people of North Vietnam stop supporting the people of the South to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

On February 6, Kosygin visited Hanoi. He shamelessly declared that he would help the Americans "find a way out of Vietnam."

On February 16, as soon as Kosygin returned to Moscow, the Soviet government proposed convening a new international conference on the Indochina issue "without preconditions." This proposal was actually the later Johnson's so-called "unconditional discussion" trick.

From the very beginning, Brezhnev and Kosygin showed with these three actions that on the Vietnamese issue, they were willing to serve U.S. imperialism wholeheartedly and could do more for them than Khrushchev.

The facts are exactly like this. From then until now, over the past two years, in the series of tricks and blackmail of "peace talks" and war played by U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has always colluded with U.S. imperialism, step by step, closely coordinated, and closely cooperated.

First, on May 12, 1965, the United States staged the first "suspension of bombing" trick. This idea was proposed by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique. Before the United States stopped bombing, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique clearly stated in a notice to some countries' communist parties that they advocated negotiating with the United States on the condition that the United States stopped bombing North Vietnam.

Second, on December 24, 1965, the United States suspended bombing for the second time, and then threw out the so-called "fourteen points" of "bombing halt and peace talks." Before this, the United States informed the Soviet Union of the decision to stop bombing; after this, the Soviet revisionists immediately announced that they would send a delegation led by Shelepin to visit Vietnam. Even Johnson said that this suspension of bombing was proposed by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique through its ambassador Dobrynin, so it was called the "Dobrynin bombing halt."

Third, on January 31, 1966, the United States resumed bombing and at the same time submitted a proposal to the United Nations Security Council for "immediate unconditional discussion." In late February, Kosygin met with British Prime Minister Wilson in Moscow to plot "peace talks" and jointly shout that "military means cannot solve the Vietnamese problem."

Fourth, on March 29, 1966, the United States, through Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, proposed convening a new Geneva Conference to peddle the "peace talks" trick again. Then, Kosygin held talks with Indira Gandhi in Moscow. Afterward, Indira Gandhi said that she had plotted with the Soviet leaders to convene a "conference based on the Geneva Agreement."

Fifth, on June 29, 1966, the United States brazenly bombed Hanoi and Haiphong. Before this, the United States informed the Soviet Union of this decision. At the same time, Johnson and Rusk openly proposed that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique convene a Geneva Conference to help the United States "end the Vietnam War." The Soviet leaders also held a series of talks with the leaders of Canada, India, Britain, and other countries, as well as the United Nations Secretary-General. The Soviet-Indian joint communiqué advocated "reconvening the Geneva Conference"; the Soviet-Indian joint communiqué advocated that only within the framework of the "Geneva Agreement" could a solution to the Vietnamese problem be found.

Sixth, in September 1966, the U.S. representative at the United Nations General Assembly threw out the "three-point proposal" and openly "asked the Soviet Union to mediate." Gromyko immediately expressed the Soviet Union's willingness to "cooperate." Then, in a meeting at the White House, Gromyko advised Johnson that as long as the United States "stopped bombing North Vietnam," the problem could be "resolved." Johnson was overjoyed and said, "I feel more inspired than ever."

Seventh, in late October 1966, the United States convened a black meeting of its Vietnamese puppets in Manila to push for "war for peace." At the same time, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique also convened a meeting of some Eastern European countries' leaders in Moscow. According to a report from a U.S. journalist in Moscow, this meeting was "part of the Soviet effort to end the (Vietnam) war."

Eighth, in early December 1966, the United States continuously bombed Hanoi, and then the U.S. representative to the United Nations wrote to the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant, asking him to help the United States achieve "peace talks." Before the United States bombed Hanoi, the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov hurried to New York to urge U Thant to intervene in the Vietnamese issue and expressed the Soviet Union's willingness to "persuade" the Vietnamese people to "come to the negotiating table."

Ninth, in February 1967, during the so-called Vietnamese "Tet truce," the United States played the "bombing halt and peace talks" trick again. Before this, the Soviet revisionist leaders and their propaganda machine, in response to Washington, blew a few months of black wind advocating "bombing halt and peace talks." After the United States stopped bombing, Kosygin immediately rushed to London and declared that as long as the United States "stopped bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam," the relevant parties could "sit at the negotiating table." Under the remote control of Washington, during the Soviet-British talks, Kosygin made a great effort to help the United States realize its "peace talks" grand conspiracy.

Tenth, on March 20 and 21, 1967, Johnson convened the Guam Conference to plan further expansion of the Vietnam War, pushing for "war to force peace." Before and after this, Kosygin and Rusk had separately received the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union and the Soviet Ambassador to the United States to secretly discuss the Vietnamese issue. The Soviet revisionist representative to the United Nations also held frequent talks with the U.S. representative and the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant. Soon, as a new product of U.S.-Soviet collusion, U Thant's "three-point proposal" came out.

All of this is ironclad evidence that the Soviet revisionist clique cannot deny. A large number of facts show that over the past two years, the Soviet revisionist clique has been colluding with U.S. imperialism in a "united action." In every trick played by U.S. imperialism, such as "bombing halt and peace talks," "war for peace," and "war to force peace," the Soviet revisionist clique has been involved.

It is you who are most enthusiastic about helping U.S. imperialism peddle the black goods of peace deception, encouraging and indulging U.S. imperialism in war blackmail. It is you who are as close as family with U.S. imperialism, giving it information, advising, mediating, and running errands. You work so hard and so energetically, indeed deserving to be the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

When U.S. imperialism occupies half of Vietnam's territory, crazily suppresses the revolutionary struggle of the people of South Vietnam, and continuously implements war "escalation" and expands the Vietnam War, when the Vietnamese people are bravely fighting and achieving great victories, you work so hard to collude with U.S. imperialism to induce the Vietnamese people to accept "peace talks." Why? In a word, it is to make the heroic Vietnamese people lay down their arms, stop resisting, and surrender to U.S. imperialism.

Is this not a blatant opposition to the just national revolutionary war? Is this not allowing U.S. imperialism to kill and burn in Vietnam but not allowing the Vietnamese people to fight back? Is this not a great betrayal of the interests of the Vietnamese people?

Nearly half a century ago, the great Lenin once severely denounced those old revisionists who did not support the liberation struggle of the oppressed peoples as "agents of the bourgeoisie," as "scoundrels and traitors." Now, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique not only does not support the Vietnamese people's revolution but also actively helps U.S. imperialism to suppress this revolution. You are thorough scabs, double-faced scoundrels, and traitors!

The Vietnamese people have been fighting for national liberation and national reunification for nearly a century. Especially during and after World War II, they took up arms to drive out Japanese militarism and French colonialism, establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In South Vietnam, they fought a bloody war against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys for eight years, finally achieving a great situation. The 31 million Vietnamese people are eagerly looking forward to the day when South Vietnam will be liberated and the country will be reunified. However, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique came out and wanted the Vietnamese people to abandon their century-old national aspirations for which they have shed blood and sacrificed, to abandon their fellow countrymen in the South, to make the people of South Vietnam return to the dark abyss of colonialism, and to become slaves of imperialism again. If this happens, the socialist mountains and rivers of North Vietnam will also be in danger of being lost. The revolutionary achievements of the Vietnamese people will be in vain, destroyed in an instant. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is a treacherous enemy of the Vietnamese national liberation cause.

We warn the gentlemen in Moscow that for such a group of big traitors who betray the Vietnamese revolution, for the big scabs who plot for U.S. imperialism, for the big accomplices who help U.S. imperialism extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese national revolutionary war, we certainly cannot engage in any "united action" with you. It was like this in the past, it is like this now, and it will always be like this in the future. Only by thoroughly exposing your faces as big traitors, big scabs, and big accomplices, and resolutely fighting against your acts of betrayal and surrender, can we truly support and aid the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation cause, and truly fulfill our internationalist duty.

There are still some people in the world who hang the banner of the Communist Party. They do not stand with the heroic Vietnamese people but breathe the same air as the Soviet revisionist clique, loudly advocating to engage in "united action" with the Soviet revisionist clique. They do everything possible to shove this number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism into the international anti-American united front. This is actually helping U.S. imperialism to sabotage and disintegrate this united front.

A true, not hypocritical, broad, not narrow, international anti-American united front must not include the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and all the accomplices and lackeys of U.S. imperialism. Otherwise, it will not be an anti-American united front but a pro-American united front.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of revolution." We must unite with our true friends to attack our true enemies. On this issue, there must be no ambiguity.

The numerous facts of international class struggle in recent years have proven that this traitor and scab clique of Soviet revisionism plays a role in sabotaging the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries that imperialism cannot play, that the reactionaries of various countries cannot play, and that the right-wing social democratic parties of capitalist countries cannot play. To oppose U.S. imperialism, we must oppose the Soviet revisionist leadership clique; to overthrow U.S. imperialism, we must overthrow the Soviet revisionist leadership clique.

Vietnam is currently the focal point of the anti-American struggle of the people of the world. The great victories of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war inspire the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. U.S. imperialism is facing the danger of annihilation in Vietnam and is also surrounded by the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. No matter how much U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism "united action," they cannot save their doom. The revolutionary torrent of the people of the world will break through the dike of reactionary forces and sweep away all demons and ghosts!

    苏修领导集团是出卖越南革命的大叛徒
    观察家
    以勃列日?夫、柯西金为首的苏联修正主义领导集团，近来又利用德国统一社会党召开第七次代表大会的机会，在越南问题上大放厥词，猖狂反华，说什么对越南的援助所以不能“更加有效”，就是因为中国反对同他们“一致行动”。
    在这次会上，苏修的忠实追随者乌布利希之流，也跟着摇旗呐喊，大肆诽谤中国。
    苏修集团重新打起破烂不堪的所谓“一致行动”的招牌，适足以表明他们已经是黔驴技穷。苏修集团这一小撮大叛徒、大工贼的可耻面目，在越南问题上越来越清楚地暴露出来。他们妄想用所谓“一致行动”的陈词滥调，来掩盖自己的滔天罪行，这是绝对办不到的。
    早在赫鲁晓夫当政的时期，苏修集团就背叛越南人民，在越南问题上同美帝国主义做交易，鼓励美帝国主义放手侵略越南。现在，他们走的更远了，不仅鼓励而且千方百计地帮助美帝国主义扑灭越南人民的革命斗争烈火。
    让我们来看一看事实吧。
    勃列日?夫和柯西金刚刚上台，屁股还没有坐定，就迫不及待地勾结美帝国主义，出卖越南。
    一九六五年一月，苏联政府遵照美国的旨意，把美国要越南北方人民停止支持南方人民的蛮横要求，转达给越南民主共和国。
    二月六日，柯西金访问河内。他无耻地宣称，要帮助美国
  “从越南找到一个出路”。
    二月十六日，柯西金一回到莫斯科，苏联政府就建议召开关于印度支那问题的“没有先决条件的”新的国际会议。这个建议实际上就是后来约翰逊的所谓“无条件讨论”的骗局。
    勃列日?夫和柯西金一开始就以这三个行动向美国表明：在越南问题上，他们愿意为美帝国主义竭诚效劳，可以比赫鲁晓夫帮更大的忙。
    实际情况正是这样。从那时到现在的两年多期间，在美帝国主义猖狂地反复地玩弄“和谈”骗局和战争讹诈的一系列阴谋活动中，苏修领导集团都是同美帝国主义串通一气、步步紧跟、密切配合的。
    第一件。一九六五年五月十二日，美国搞了第一次“暂停轰炸”的把戏。这个主意就是苏修领导集团出的。在美国停炸前不久，苏修领导集团在给一些国家的共产党的通知中，明明白白地说，他们主张同美国谈判，条件是美国停止对越南北方的轰炸。
    第二件。一九六五年十二月二十四日，美国第二次“暂停轰炸”，接着就抛出了“停炸诱和”的所谓“十四点”。在这之前，美国把停炸的决定通知了苏联；在这之后，苏修马上宣布派谢列平率代表团访问越南。连约翰逊都说，这次停炸是苏修领导集团通过它的大使多勃雷宁建议的，所以叫做“多勃雷宁停炸”。
    第三件。一九六六年一月三十一日，美国恢复轰炸，同时向联合国安理会提出“立即无条件地进行讨论”的“提案”。二月下旬，柯西金同英国首相威尔逊在莫斯科会晤，策划“和谈”，共同叫嚷“军事手段不能解决越南问题”。
    第四件。一九六六年三月二十九日，美国通过印度总理英迪拉·甘地提出召开新的日内瓦会议，再次兜售“和谈”骗局。接着，柯西金在莫斯科同英迪拉·甘地举行会谈。事后英迪拉·甘地说，她曾同苏联首脑策划召开“在日内瓦协议基础上”的“一次会议”。
    第五件。一九六六年六月二十九日，美国悍然轰炸河内海防。事先美国把这个决定通知了苏联。同时，约翰逊和腊斯克公开提出要苏修领导集团召开日内瓦会议，帮助美国“结束越南战争”。苏修头目们还先后同加拿大、印度、英国等国领导人，以及联合国秘书长举行了一系列会谈。苏加联合公报主张“重新召开日内瓦会议”；苏印联合公报鼓吹只有在“日内瓦协议的范围内才能找到解决越南问题的办法”。
    第六件。一九六六年九月，美国代表在联合国大会上抛出了“三点建议”，并且公开“请苏联斡旋”。葛罗米柯马上表示苏联愿意“合作”。接着，葛罗米柯在白宫同约翰逊的会谈中献策说，只要美国“停炸北越”，问题就可以“求得解决”。约翰逊听了以后，兴高采烈地说：“我感到前所未有的鼓舞”。
    第七件。一九六六年十月下旬，美国召集侵越的仆从在马尼拉开了个黑会，大搞“以战迫和”。同时苏修领导集团在莫斯科也召集东欧一些国家领导人开会。据美国记者从莫斯科发出的报道说，这个会是“苏联要了结这场（越南）战争”的“努力的一部分”。
    第八件。一九六六年十二月上旬，美国连续轰炸河内，接着美国驻联合国代表写信给联合国秘书长吴丹，要他帮助美国实现“和谈”。在美国轰炸河内之前，苏联副外长库兹?佐夫匆匆赶到纽约，督促吴丹插手越南问题，并表示苏联愿意“说服”越南人民“到会议桌旁来”。
    第九件。一九六七年二月，美国在所谓越南“春节停火”期间，又一次玩弄了“停炸诱和”的把戏，在这之前，苏修头目和它的宣传机器，同华盛顿遥相呼应，刮了几个月的鼓吹“停炸和谈”的黑风。在美国停炸之后，柯西金马上赶到伦敦，宣称只要美国“停止轰炸越南民主共和国”，有关各方就能“坐到谈判桌旁”。在这种情况下，美国提出了要越南人民采取所谓“对等行动”来换取美国停止轰炸越南北方的要求。在华盛顿遥控下的苏英会谈期间，柯西金为了帮助美国实现它的“和谈”大阴谋，殷勤地作了一番努力。
    第十件。一九六七年三月二十日、二十一日，约翰逊召集了策划进一步扩大侵越战争的关岛会议，推行“以战压降”。在此前后，柯西金和腊斯克曾先后分别接见美国驻苏大使和苏联驻美大使，密商越南问题。苏修驻联合国代表同美国代表和联合国秘书长吴丹也进行了频繁的会谈。不久，作为美苏合谋新产物的吴丹“三点建议”就出笼了。
    所有这一切，铁证如山，这是苏修集团想赖也赖不掉的。大量事实表明，两年多来，苏修集团一直在同美帝国主义大搞“一致行动”。美帝国主义先后玩弄的“停炸诱和”、“以战迫和”、“以战压降”等等阴谋，没有那一次少了苏修集团的份。
    正是你们，最热心地帮助美帝国主义推销和平欺骗的黑货，鼓励和纵容美帝国主义进行战争讹诈。正是你们，同美帝国主义亲如一家，给它通风报信，出谋划策，拉拢撮合，奔走效劳。你们干得那么起劲，那样卖力，的确不愧是美帝国主义头号帮凶。
    当着美帝国主义侵占越南一半国土，疯狂镇压越南南方人民革命斗争，并且不断实行战争“升级”，扩大侵越战争的时候，当着越南人民英勇抗战，取得了伟大胜利的时候，你们那样费尽心机，伙同美帝国主义诱迫越南人民接受“和谈”，这是为什么？一句话，就是要英雄的越南人民放下武器，停止抵抗，向美帝国主义屈膝投降。
    这难道不是公然反对正义的民族革命战争吗？这难道不是只许美帝国主义在越南杀人放火，不许越南人民还手吗？这难道不是对越南人民利益的大出卖吗？
    伟大的列宁在近半个世纪以前，就曾痛斥过那些不支持被压迫人民解放斗争的老修正主义者是“资产阶级的代理人”，是
  “恶棍和叛徒”。现在，苏修领导集团，非但不支持越南人民的革命，而且还积极帮助美帝国主义，扼杀这场革命。你们是彻底的工贼，双料的恶棍和叛徒！
    越南人民为了民族的解放和祖国的统一进行了近一个世纪的斗争。特别是第二次世界大战期间和大战结束以后，他们拿起武器赶走了日本军国主义和法国殖民者，成立了越南民主共和国。在越南南方，他们又同美帝国主义及其走狗进行了八年的浴血苦战，终于打出了一个大好形势。三千一百万越南人民热切盼望的解放南方、统一祖国的日子正在一天天临近。可是，苏修领导集团竟然跑出来，要越南人民放弃百年来为之流血牺牲的民族愿望，抛掉他们南方的骨肉同胞，使越南南方人民重新回到殖民地的黑暗深渊，重新沦为帝国主义的奴隶。如果这样，越南北方的社会主义江山也将有丧失的危险。越南人民的革命成果将付之东流，毁于一旦。苏修领导集团是越南民族解放事业的阴险的敌人。
    正告莫斯科的老爷们，对于你们这样一伙出卖越南革命的大叛徒，为美帝国主义出谋划策的大工贼，美帝国主义扑灭越南民族革命战争烈火的大帮凶，我们当然绝对不能同你们去搞什么“一致行动”。过去如此，现在如此，今后永远如此。只有彻底揭露你们的大叛徒、大工贼、大帮凶的面目，坚决同你们的投降叛卖活动进行不调和的斗争，才是真正对越南人民抗美救国事业的革命的支持和援助，也才是真正履行我们的无产阶级国际主义的义务。
    世界上还有那么一些挂着共产党招牌的人，他们不是同英雄的越南人民站在一起，却同苏修集团一鼻孔出气，大肆鼓吹要同苏修集团搞什么“统一行动”。他们千方百计地要把这个美帝国主义的头号帮凶塞进国际反美统一战线中来。这实际上是在帮助美帝国主义破坏和瓦解这个统一战线。
    一个真正的、而不是虚伪的，广泛的而不是狭隘的国际反美统一战线，决不能包括苏修领导集团以及美帝国主义的一切帮凶和走卒。否则，就不是反美统一战线，而变成亲美统一战线了。
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”我们必须团结我们的真正朋友，以攻击我们的真正敌人。在这个问题上丝毫也不能含糊。
    近年来国际阶级斗争的无数事实证明，苏修这个叛徒和工贼集团，在破坏各国人民革命斗争方面，起了帝国主义所不能起的作用，起了各国反动派所不能起的作用，起了资本主义国家右翼社会民主党所不能起的作用。要反对美帝国主义，就必须反对苏修领导集团；要打倒美帝国主义，就必须打倒苏修领导集团。
    越南是当前全世界人民反美斗争的焦点。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，鼓舞着亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命斗争。美帝国主义既在越南面临着灭顶之灾，也处在亚、非、拉和全世界革命人民的重重围困之中。美帝和苏修不管怎样“一致行动”，都不能挽救他们的灭亡。全世界人民的革命洪流，必将冲决反动势力的堤坝，把一切妖魔鬼怪通通席卷而去！
