Comrade Peng Zhen wrote "Is It Patriotism or Treachery?" which was published. This article hits the nail on the head by pointing out that a certain person is the chief backer of a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, the top capitalist-roader in the Party holding power, and the Khrushchev sleeping in our midst. This article is excellent! It is superb!

A certain person has always worn the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, deceiving people everywhere, and peddling a lot of black goods. "Cultivation" is one of them. This book has spread widely and caused great harm both domestically and internationally. It is a hodgepodge of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, a representative work of reactionary idealism, a program and manifesto for the restoration of capitalism, and a thoroughly anti-Marxist-Leninist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisonous weed! Now is the time for a thorough reckoning with "Cultivation"! We must peel off its disguise, expose it to the public, and thoroughly eliminate its pernicious influence!

In this book of over forty thousand words, he relentlessly denigrates the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism of our time—the great Mao Zedong Thought—and uses the most vicious language to madly attack our dearest Red Sun, Chairman Mao. It is completely detached from the revolution, from class struggle, and from the dictatorship of the proletariat to advocate "cultivation" and to pursue "morality." This is all deceit!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." From the time it was published, this book has always collaborated with various reactionary forces in society and opportunistic trends within the Party to attack the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Especially in 1962, when an anti-China tide arose internationally, and a small clique of ghosts and snakes in our country began to stir and take the stage, this person saw that the time was ripe. After careful revision, he threw out this poisonous weed again to create public opinion for his plot to usurp the Party, the army, and political power. This is a genuine manifesto for counter-revolutionary restoration. Its essence is to usurp power, and its method is to let the "self" usurp power in people's souls, thereby achieving his evil goal of usurping power nationwide. This is a great conspiracy. We must thoroughly expose and smash this great conspiracy!

To achieve the goal of usurping power, he appears as the "embodiment of the Party," using his revisionist "Cultivation" to corrupt our broad masses of Party members, attempting to train Party members into obedient slaves, into confused fools who do not think, into his docile tools; attempting to make the entire Party listen to his orders. If his conspiracy succeeds, it will not be long before there is a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration, and the Marxist-Leninist Party will become a revisionist Party, a fascist Party. The whole of China will change color. How dangerous this is!

What kind of Party spirit should a Party member have? Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" are the highest standard of Party spirit! But in "Cultivation," under the banner of "Party spirit training" and "Party member cultivation," a certain person peddles Confucius and Mencius' "self-examination," peddles the bourgeois philistine philosophy of "suffering small losses to gain big advantages," and subtly advocates individualism and slavishness, attempting to corrupt the souls of our comrades and cultivate revisionist successors. How can we not thoroughly criticize such a poisonous weed?

It should be pointed out that because the top capitalist-roader in the Party has long usurped Party and government power, he can use his authority to widely promote "Cultivation" among the youth, making many of our comrades deeply influenced by it. Isn't it true that many comrades, after learning "Cultivation," are tightly bound within the small circle of "self" and cannot extricate themselves? Isn't it true that many comrades, after learning "Cultivation," focus on minor details in dealing with people and things, thereby rising rapidly in their careers, becoming spiritual aristocrats detached from the masses? Isn't it true that many comrades, after learning "Cultivation," completely lose their combativeness, becoming willfully degenerate, full of slavishness, and hypocritical? Isn't it true that some comrades have already "cultivated" and "practiced" to be very "obedient" and "submissive," and in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they stubbornly defend a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the wrong line, becoming victims of the bourgeois reactionary line? In a word, if one continues to "cultivate" in this way, one will only become more and more "cultivated," only sink deeper and deeper into the mire of individualism, and only peacefully evolve into revisionism. The bitter lessons of history have taught us that "Cultivation" is not a Marxist-Leninist pamphlet at all, but a narcotic that corrupts people's souls, a poison wrapped in gold paper, a poisonous snake disguised as a beautiful woman!

In summary, without criticizing "Cultivation," we cannot thoroughly uproot the revisionist roots; without thoroughly criticizing "Cultivation," we cannot break with the private ownership ideology of thousands of years and establish the communist public ownership ideology; without thoroughly criticizing "Cultivation," we cannot liberate the broad masses of people who have been poisoned and deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line; without thoroughly criticizing "Cultivation," we cannot make Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply rooted in people's hearts; without thoroughly criticizing "Cultivation," we cannot carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." The essence of Marxism-Leninism is revolutionary and critical. Thoroughly criticizing "Cultivation" is an important part of struggle, criticism, and transformation; it is an important aspect of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Thoroughly criticizing "Cultivation" is the greatest support for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country; it is a great contribution to the world revolution. We actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, take up the pen as a weapon, wage a people's war, and in the struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our school, and launch a high tide of criticizing "Cultivation," exposing the ugly soul of China's Khrushchev in broad daylight!

Criticizing "Cultivation" is a deeper revolution that touches people's souls, not just an academic criticism. We especially hope that comrades who have been poisoned by "Cultivation" will bravely stand up, investigate the deception, investigate the harm, investigate the root cause, and with their personal experiences, criticize it, accuse it of poisoning them, and wage a revolution in their souls, quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat!

This book "Cultivation" is deceitful, detached from the class struggle and revolution of reality, detached from political struggle, and does not mention the fundamental issue of revolution, which is the issue of power, and does not mention the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It advocates idealist cultivation theory, subtly advocates bourgeois individualism, and advocates slavishness, opposing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Following this book to "cultivate" will only make one more and more "cultivated," more and more a revisionist. This book must be thoroughly criticized, and its pernicious influence must be eliminated. The criticism of this book is also an important part of the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line.

    《修养》是腐蚀人们灵魂的麻醉剂
    北京航空学院　《红旗》报编辑部
    戚本禹同志写的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》发表了，这篇文章一针见血地指出，某某人就是一小撮反革命修正主义分子的总后台，就是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫。这篇文章好得很！好极了！
    某某人一贯披着马克思列宁主义外衣，到处招摇撞骗，贩卖了不少黑货。《修养》就是其中之一。这本书在国内外流毒甚广，影响极坏。这是一篇封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的大杂烩，是一篇反动唯心主义的代表作，是一篇资本主义复辟的总纲领和宣言书，是一篇彻头彻尾的反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的大毒草！现在到了彻底清算《修养》的时候了！我们要剥开它的画皮，使之暴尸于众，彻底肃清其恶劣影响！
    他在这本洋洋四万多字的《修养》中，竭力诋毁当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义——伟大的毛泽东思想，并且用尽最恶毒的语言疯狂地攻击我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。它脱离革命，脱离阶级斗争，脱离无产阶级专政去宣扬什么“修养”，去追求什么“道德”，这完全是欺人之谈！
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”《修养》这本书从出版时起，就一直配合着社会上的各种反动势力和党内的机会主义思潮，向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部进攻。特别是在一九六二年国际上出现了一股反华逆流，国内一小撮牛鬼蛇神蠢蠢欲动，粉墨登场，这时某某人看到时机已到，经过精心修改，再次抛出这部毒草，为他篡党、篡军、篡政制造舆论。这是一篇地地道道的反革命复辟的宣言书，其要害就在于篡权，它的手段是让“私”字在人们灵魂深处篡权，继而达到他在全国全面篡权的罪恶目的，这是一个大阴谋。对于他的这个大阴谋必须彻底揭穿，迎头痛击！
    为了实现篡权的目的，他以“党的化身”出现，用他修正主义的《修养》来腐蚀我们的广大党员，妄图把党员训教成百依百顺的奴隶，训教成不动脑筋的糊涂虫，训教成他的驯服工具；妄图使全党都听他发号施令。如果他的阴谋得逞，那么不要很久，就会出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。这是何等的危险啊！
    一个党员应该有什么样的党性？毛主席的“老三篇”就是党性的最高标准！可是在“修养”中某某人在“党性锻炼”、“党员修养”的堂皇招牌下，大肆贩卖孔孟的“三省吾身”，大肆贩卖“吃小亏，占大便宜”的资产阶级市侩哲学，转弯抹角地提倡个人主义，提倡奴隶主义，企图以此来腐蚀我们同志的灵魂，培养修正主义接班人。对于这样的大毒草不彻底批判怎么行呢？
    应该指出，由于党内头号走资本主义道路当权派长期窃踞党政大权，就能够利用他的权势，大肆向青年推销《修养》，使我们的很多同志已经“修”得不浅。不是有许多同志学了《修养》后被紧紧地束缚在“我”字的小圈圈里而不能自拔了吗？不是有许多同志学了《修养》后在处人、处事等“小节”上狠下功夫，因而青云直上，飞黄腾达，成为脱离群众的精神贵族吗？不是有许多同志学了《修养》后完全丢掉了斗争性，成了意志颓废，奴隶主义十足的伪君子吗？不是还有的同志已经“苦修苦练”得非常“顺从”、“服贴”，在这场文化大革命中死保党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，死保错误路线，成为资产阶级反动路线的牺牲品吗？一句话，照此“修养”下去，只会越养越“修”，只会在个人主义的泥坑中越陷越深，只会和平演变到修正主义。惨痛的事实教训了我们，《修养》根本不是什么马列主义的小册子，而是腐蚀人们灵魂的麻醉剂，是裹着金纸的毒品，是化装成美女的毒蛇！
    总之，不批判《修养》，就不能彻底铲除修正主义根子；不彻底批判《修养》，就不能大破几千年以来的私有观念，大立共产主义的公有观念；不彻底批判《修养》，就不能解放广大受资产阶级反动路线毒害和蒙蔽的群众；不彻底批判《修养》，就不能使毛主席的革命路线深入人心；不彻底批判《修养》，就不能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席教导我们，“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。”马列主义的本质是革命的，批判的。彻底批判《修养》，就是斗、批、改的重要内容，就是文化大革命的重要方面；彻底批判《修养》就是对全国各地无产阶级革命派的最大支持，就是对世界革命的巨大贡献。我们积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，拿起笔做刀枪，打一场人民战争，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，在我院掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，掀起一个批判《修养》的高潮，使中国的赫鲁晓夫的丑恶灵魂暴露在光天化日之下！
    批判《修养》，这是一场更深入地触及人们灵魂的大革命，而决不是什么学术批判。我们特别希望受《修养》毒害的同志勇敢地站出来，查上当、查危害、查根源，以自己的切身体会批判它，控诉它对自己的毒害，在灵魂深处大闹革命，尽快地回到毛主席的革命路线上来，和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗！
    《修养》这本书，是欺人之谈，脱离现实的阶级斗争，脱离革命，脱离政治斗争，闭口不谈革命的根本问题是政权问题，闭口不谈无产阶级专政问题，宣扬唯心主义的修养论，转弯抹角地提倡资产阶级个人主义，提倡奴隶主义，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。按照这本书去“修养”，只能是越养越“修”，越修养越成为修正主义。对这本书必须彻底批判，肃清它的恶劣影响。对这本书的批判，也是批判资产阶级反动路线的重要内容。	                        《红旗》杂志一九六七年第五期
