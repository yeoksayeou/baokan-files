Vietnamese newspapers and radio stations have enthusiastically celebrated the glorious victory of the People's Liberation Army Air Force in annihilating two invading American aggressor aircraft on April 24.

The _People's Daily_ and _People's Army Daily_ both published commentaries on April 27, praising the outstanding feat of the People's Liberation Army Air Force. The _People's Daily_ commentary stated that this remarkable achievement is a well-deserved punishment for American imperialism and a stern warning to it. The commentary strongly condemned the Johnson administration's piratical war provocations against China. It said that the Johnson administration's arrogant threats against the Chinese people are extremely foolish. The seven hundred million Chinese people are not afraid of any threats from American imperialism. The commentary said that the People's Liberation Army's annihilation of two American aircraft is a splendid coordination with the fighting of the Vietnamese people, a vivid manifestation of the combat unity between the two friendly countries in their resolute struggle against their common enemy, American imperialism, until they achieve complete victory.

The _People's Army Daily_ commentary said, "The glorious feat once again achieved by the heroic and outstanding air force of the brotherly People's Liberation Army of China has struck terror into the enemy and delighted our friends." The commentary said that in Vietnamese airspace, more than 1,800 American aggressor aircraft have been shot down by the anti-aircraft fire of the Vietnamese people in the north. In Chinese airspace, American air pirates have again been punished by the heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force of China.

The commentary warned that if American imperialism stubbornly continues down the path of adventure, it will inevitably face even more severe punishment.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 26, the "Voice of Vietnam" radio station published a commentary on April 26, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious victory of the People's Liberation Army Air Force in shooting down two American aircraft over a certain place in Guangxi. The commentary said that the feat of the Chinese air force warriors, together with the feats of the Vietnamese people in the north, has composed a heroic anthem. It expresses the iron will of the Chinese people to unite closely and resolutely defeat American imperialism.

The commentary concluded by saying that the Vietnamese military and people are determined to further strengthen their combat unity with the brotherly People's Liberation Army and people of China, to continue to heighten their vigilance, to be ready for battle at any time, to resolutely smash all new "escalations" of the war by American imperialism, and to give it the punishment it deserves for all its evil deeds until it is completely annihilated.
