One of the important tasks on our ideological front now is to launch a criticism of revisionism.

Use the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize "Cultivation"

— Selected Criticisms of "Cultivation" by the Model Red Ninth Company in Studying Chairman Mao's Works

The officers and soldiers of the "Model Red Ninth Company in Studying Chairman Mao's Works," with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, the Party, and the people, use the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, combined with their own struggle practice, to fiercely criticize the big poisonous weed "Cultivation" maliciously concocted by the top capitalist-roadier in the Party. The officers and soldiers point out: "Cultivation" is completely a deceitful talk, a revisionist manifesto. As the editorial in the "Red Flag" magazine pointed out, it "detaches from the real class struggle, detaches from revolution, detaches from political struggle, does not mention the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power, does not mention the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat, advocates idealist cultivation theory, obliquely promotes bourgeois individualism, promotes slave ideology, opposes Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought." Therefore, in the nationwide criticism of the top capitalist-roadier in the Party, we must thoroughly uproot this big poisonous weed "Cultivation," thoroughly purge its poison, and let the great Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy all our ideological positions.

We Must Forever Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought

Deputy Political Instructor Li Zhen Guo

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical foundation guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." Great Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. All our achievements and victories are gained under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, instructs us: "Mao Zedong Thought is the science of revolution, the truth of the proletariat tested by long-term revolutionary struggle, the most practical Marxism-Leninism, and the unified program of action for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country." This clearly tells us: to make a revolution, we must strive to master Mao Zedong Thought, truly learn Mao Zedong Thought, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

However, the top capitalist-roadier in the Party does the opposite, fiercely opposing Mao Zedong Thought. In the book "Cultivation," he does not mention learning the great Mao Zedong Thought, does not mention learning Chairman Mao's works, does not mention learning Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice. On many fundamental issues, he openly opposes Chairman Mao, fiercely opposing Mao Zedong Thought. He quotes Confucius and Mencius and bourgeois philosophy of life over and over again, writing them down in large letters, attempting to use these black goods to oppose the great Mao Zedong Thought. He even insinuates and viciously attacks Chairman Mao, attempting to undermine Chairman Mao's lofty prestige among the people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the whole world. This is intolerable! We must expose his reactionary face in broad daylight.

Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and it is also the most powerful weapon for Communist Party members and revolutionary soldiers to transform their thoughts and raise their consciousness. Take our Red Ninth Company as an example. This is a Red Army company personally founded by Chairman Mao on Jinggangshan. Over the past thirty years, the comrades in the company have grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, the Party, and the people. In revolutionary wars, they fought bravely and selflessly, making due contributions to the people. After the founding of the country, they have been vigilant in guarding their battle positions, faithfully performing the glorious task of defending the socialist revolution and socialist construction of our motherland. Especially since Comrade Lin Biao took charge of the work of the Central Military Commission and called on the entire army to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, the entire company has even higher held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continually using Mao Zedong Thought to promote their own ideological revolutionization. The company has produced a large number of advanced individuals. In the army, they always maintain a strong fighting will and are the backbone of the company's construction. When they go to the countryside, they bring redness wherever they go, becoming "red seeds." Ask yourself, can the cultivation of Confucius and Mencius and the rotten bourgeois "philosophy of life" produce such Communist Party members and revolutionary soldiers? Confucius and Mencius and the bourgeois "philosophy of life" can only cultivate the filial sons and worthy grandsons of the exploiting class, can only cultivate revisionists. Only with Mao Zedong Thought can we cultivate Communist Party members and revolutionary soldiers who have the most political foresight, are the most rich in revolutionary spirit, have the most communist morality, and can best serve the people.

The top capitalist-roadier in the Party has always opposed the great Mao Zedong Thought, manifesting in various aspects. After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he once advocated the line of capitulationism, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary principle of "fighting to the finish, not giving up an inch of land"; after the founding of the People's Republic of China, he insisted on pursuing capitalism, opposing socialism; after the completion of the three major transformations in our country, he vigorously advocated the theory of the extinction of class struggle, opposing Chairman Mao's theory that class and class struggle still exist in socialist society; during the three years of difficulty in our country, he advocated the revisionist line of "three selfs and one package," "three harmonies and one less," attacking the three red banners; in this great proletarian cultural revolution, he again colluded with another top capitalist-roadier in the Party to propose and implement the bourgeois reactionary line, opposing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

From this, it can be seen that this self-proclaimed "old revolutionary" is actually a thorough and through counter-revolutionary, anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought fake revolutionary. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely overthrow them.

    我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。
    用光焰无际的毛泽东思想把《修养》批深批透
    ——“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”批判《修养》文章选登
    “学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”的指战员，怀着无限忠于毛主席、忠于党、忠于人民的革命感情，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想，结合自己的斗争实践，激愤地批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派蓄意炮制的大毒草《修养》。指战员们指出：《修养》这本书完全是欺人之谈，是一篇修正主义的宣言书，正如《红旗》杂志评论员文章所指出的，它“脱离现实的阶级斗争，脱离革命，脱离政治斗争，闭口不谈革命的根本问题是政权问题，闭口不谈无产阶级专政问题，宣扬唯心主义的修养论，转弯抹角地提倡资产阶级个人主义，提倡奴隶主义，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想”，因此，在全国革命人民对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派进行大批判中，必须彻底铲除《修养》这株大毒草，彻底肃清它的流毒，让伟大的毛泽东思想永远占领我们的一切思想阵地。

    我们就是要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    副指导员　李振国
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”伟大的毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的一个崭新阶段，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛泽东思想的指引下取得的。毛主席最亲密的战友林彪同志指示我们说：“毛泽东思想是革命的科学，是经过长期革命斗争考验的无产阶级的真理，是最现实的马克思列宁主义，是全党全军全国人民的统一的行动纲领。”这就清楚地告诉我们：要革命，就必须努力掌握毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，就必须读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    但是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却反其道而行之，猖狂反对毛泽东思想。在《修养》一书中，他绝口不谈学习伟大的毛泽东思想，不谈学习毛主席著作，不谈学习毛主席伟大的革命实践。他在许多根本性的问题上，公然和毛主席唱对台戏，猖狂反对毛泽东思想。他对孔孟之道和资产阶级的处世哲学，引了又引，大书特书，妄图用这些黑货，来和伟大的毛泽东思想相对抗。他甚至含沙射影地恶毒攻击毛主席，妄图破坏毛主席在全国人民和全世界革命人民中的崇高威望。是可忍，孰不可忍！我们一定要把他的反动面目暴露在光天化日之下。
    毛泽东思想是中国革命和世界革命的指路明灯，也是我们共产党员和革命战士改造思想、提高觉悟的最有力的武器。以我们红九连来说，这是毛主席在井冈山亲手缔造的红军连队。三十多年来，连队的同志在毛泽东思想的哺育下，不断成长，无限忠于毛主席，忠于党，忠于人民。在革命战争中，他们英勇顽强，前赴后继，为人民作出了应有的贡献。建国以后，又百倍警惕地坚守战斗岗位，忠实地执行着保卫祖国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的光荣任务。特别是林彪同志主持中央军委工作，号召全军活学活用毛主席著作以来，全连同志更加高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不断用毛泽东思想促进自己思想革命化，连队里涌现出大批先进人物。在部队，他们始终保持坚强的战斗意志，是连队建设的坚强骨干。到地方，他们走到哪里红到哪里，成为一颗颗“红色的种子”。试问，用两千年前的孔孟之道和腐朽透顶的资产阶级“人生哲学”，能“修养”出这样的共产党员和革命战士吗？孔孟之道和资产阶级的“人生哲学”，只能“修养”出剥削阶级的孝子贤孙，只能“修养”出修正主义分子。只有用毛泽东思想，才能培养出最有政治远见，最富于革命精神，最有共产主义道德，最能为人民服务的共产党员和革命战士。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派反对伟大的毛泽东思想，是一贯的，表现在各个方面的。抗日战争结束以后，他就曾以投降主义路线，反对毛主席“针锋相对，寸土必争”的革命方针；在中华人民共和国成立以后，他坚持搞资本主义，反对搞社会主义；在我国社会主义三大改造完成以后，他又竭力宣扬阶级斗争熄灭论，反对毛主席关于社会主义社会仍然存在阶级和阶级斗争的理论；在我国三年困难时期，他鼓吹“三自一包”、“三和一少”的修正主义路线，攻击三面红旗；在这次伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，他又伙同党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路的当权派提出和推行资产阶级反动路线，反对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    由此可见，这个自封的所谓“老革命”，实际上是地地道道的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的假革命。谁反对毛泽东思想，我们就坚决把他打倒。
