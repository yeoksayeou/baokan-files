The question of "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends?" is the primary question of the revolution. This question is also the primary question in carrying out the great commander Chairman Mao's directive to actively support the broad masses of the left. In executing the task of supporting the left, we must first distinguish between enemies, friends, and ourselves, and solve the problem of who to rely on, who to unite with, and who to strike. Our military must be good at identifying the leftists and resolutely supporting and relying on the genuine revolutionary leftists.

Whether we can correctly identify the revolutionary leftists is the key to whether we can firmly grasp the direction of the struggle in this decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. If we see correctly, we support correctly; if we see incorrectly, we support incorrectly. The situation of class struggle is complex and intricate. The units executing the support task must treat this problem with a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, and be extremely cautious, absolutely not careless.

Only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, taking the struggle between the two lines as the key, using Chairman Mao's method of class analysis as a weapon, closely relying on the masses, and conducting thorough investigations and research, can we distinguish who the genuine revolutionary leftists are.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, there has always been a struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the reactionary bourgeois line represented by the top capitalist-roaders within the party. The leftist forces in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have grown up in the fierce struggle between the two lines. They stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, insist on taking the socialist road, love Chairman Mao limitlessly, are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and act according to Chairman Mao's directives. They possess the fearless spirit of proletarian revolutionaries, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, rise up to thoroughly criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois line, and thoroughly criticize the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie. At the crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, they follow Chairman Mao's teachings, implement the great alliance of the revolutionary leftists and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and resolutely seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. They may have made various mistakes, but this is only one finger out of ten, and they can overcome their shortcomings and correct their mistakes in the struggle. Their revolutionary direction is always correct.

In evaluating and identifying whether a mass organization is a revolutionary leftist, we must look at their direction, see whom they direct their struggle against, which class and which representatives of that class. We must see if they are resolutely exposing and fighting against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. We must see if their struggle is directed against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. We must see which side they stand on in the struggle between the two lines, whether they stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line or on the side of the reactionary bourgeois line, whether they insist on taking the socialist road or the capitalist road.

We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and firmly grasp the method of class analysis. When evaluating whether an organization is a revolutionary leftist organization, we must see if they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We must look at their direction.

We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and look at problems comprehensively and historically. We must not only look at one-time events but also look at the entire history and the entire work, and look at their entire development process. It is not strange for leftist mass organizations, due to their lack of struggle experience, to make some mistakes in the process of struggle, especially in complex situations at critical turning points in the revolution, and for some impure phenomena to appear in the process of great development. As long as their main aspect, their essential aspect, and their mainstream aspect are good, we must support them and enthusiastically help them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, consciously rectify their thoughts, styles, and organizations. We must strictly distinguish between revolutionary leftist organizations that have made some mistakes and the few reactionary organizations, and strictly distinguish between them and conservative organizations.

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the party are trying every means to destroy the leftist forces. They collude with the ghosts and snakes in society and instruct some conservative organizations to seize on some shortcomings and mistakes of the revolutionary leftists, exaggerate them, attack one point and ignore the rest, and even spread rumors and slander, fabricating all sorts of charges against the revolutionary leftists. They distort right and wrong, confuse people's vision, and try to make us go astray and stand on the wrong side. We must be vigilant and resolutely smash their plots!

Chairman Mao said: "All conclusions come at the end of the investigation of the situation, not at the beginning."

In front of us, there are various mass organizations and their representatives. We know very little about their situation in the past, and we may not know them at all. What should we do? The broad revolutionary masses are the masters of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary masses have the firmest stance, the clearest love and hate, the keenest eyes, and the clearest view of major issues and minor issues. They know the actual situation best and have the most say. We must go deep into the masses, blend with the masses, honestly be the students of the masses, and humbly learn from the masses. We must conduct extensive and thorough investigations and research through broad contact, understand the political views and actual actions of various mass organizations and their representatives, understand their history and current situation, understand their connections with those above and below, and so on. Only by listening to opinions from all sides, not just one side, and not being biased, and only by mastering a large amount of comprehensive information, not just some one-sided materials, can we conduct scientific analysis and make correct judgments. "Without investigating the actual situation, one will fall into the pit of empty talk and blind action." That is very dangerous.

The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental way to distinguish between enemies and friends and identify the revolutionary leftists. We must insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as the criterion, closely combine it with the development of the situation and the practice of the struggle, aim at the living thoughts, and extensively and deeply conduct education on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the struggle between the two lines among the troops. We must make the cadres and soldiers deeply understand Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the top capitalist-roader within the party and the reactionary bourgeois line he proposed, fully recognize the great achievements of the revolutionary youngsters in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and establish a deep class sentiment with the proletarian revolutionaries. In this way, at the crucial moment of the struggle, the troops can stand firmly, hold high the banner, timely and correctly discover and identify the revolutionary leftists, resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary leftists, and provide the strongest support and assistance.

Chairman Mao's great call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad masses of the left has given us the army a heavy responsibility. We have made contributions to this. All comrades in the army must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, work diligently, be humble and modest, listen to the opinions of the masses, continuously improve our work, better support the revolutionary leftists, unite the majority of the masses, and severely strike the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, making greater contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    再论紧紧掌握斗争的大方向
    “谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”这个问题，也是我军执行伟大统帅毛主席给予的积极支持左派广大群众这个重大任务的首要问题。我们在执行支左任务中，首先必须分清敌友我，解决依靠谁、团结谁、打击谁的问题。我军必须善于发现左派，坚决支持和依靠真正的革命左派。
    能不能正确地识别革命左派，是关系到我们在当前这场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战中，能不能紧紧掌握斗争的大方向的关键。看对了，就支援对了；看错了，就支援错了。阶级斗争的情况错综复杂。执行支援任务的部队，一定要以高度的革命责任感，十分慎重地对待这个问题，万万不可粗心大意。
    只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，以两条路线斗争为纲，以毛主席的阶级分析方法为武器，紧紧地依靠群众，深入进行调查研究，才能够辨明谁是真正的革命左派。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，始终存在着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线的斗争。无产阶级文化大革命中的左派队伍，是在两条路线的激烈斗争中成长起来的。他们站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，他们坚持走社会主义道路，他们无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。他们具有大无畏的无产阶级革命造反精神，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，起来大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，大造资产阶级反动学术“权威”的反。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，他们遵照毛主席的教导，实行无产阶级革命派大联合和革命的“三结合”，坚决向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权。他们可能犯过这样那样的错误，但是，这只不过是十个指头中的一个指头，而且他们能够在斗争中不断地克服缺点，修正错误。他们革命的大方向始终是正确的。
    我们衡量和识别一个群众组织是不是革命左派，就是要看他们的大方向，看他们把斗争的矛头指向谁，指向那个阶级、那个阶级的代表人物。看他们对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是不是坚决揭露，坚决斗争。看他们的斗争矛头是不是指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。看他们在两条路线斗争中究竟站在那一边，是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边，是坚持走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路。
    我们要遵照毛主席的教导，紧紧掌握阶级分析的方法。在衡量一个组织是否革命左派组织的时候，要看他们是不是高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，是不是贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，要看他们的大方向。
    我们要遵照毛主席的教导，全面地、历史地看问题。不但要看一时一事，而且要看全部历史和全部工作，要看他们发展的全部过程。左派群众组织由于缺乏斗争经验，他们在斗争过程中，特别在革命发展转折关头的复杂情况下，犯一些错误，在大发展中出现某些组织不纯的现象，是没有什么奇怪的。只要他们的主要方面，他们的本质的方面、主流的方面是好的，我们就要支持他们，满腔热情地帮助他们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，自觉地整顿思想、整顿作风、整顿组织。我们一定要把犯过某些错误的革命左派组织，同极少数的反动组织严格区别开来，同保守组织严格区别开来。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，千方百计地企图搞垮革命左派队伍。他们勾结社会上的牛鬼蛇神，并指使一些保守派组织，抓住革命左派的某些缺点和错误，加以夸大，攻其一点，不及其余，甚至造谣污蔑，无中生有，给革命左派妄加种种罪名。他们颠倒黑白，混淆视听，妄图使我们认错门，站错队。我们一定要提高警惕，坚决粉碎他们的阴谋！
    毛主席说：“一切结论产生于调查情况的末尾，而不是在它的先头。”
    在我们面前，有着各种群众组织和他们的代表人物。我们过去对他们的情况知道得很少，甚至完全不了解。怎么办呢？广大革命群众是无产阶级文化大革命的主人。革命群众的立场最坚定，爱憎最分明，眼睛最亮，大是大非看得最清。他们最了解实际情况，最有发言权。我们一定要深入到群众中去，和群众打成一片，老老实实当群众的学生，虚心地向群众请教。要通过广泛接触，深入周密地进行调查研究，了解各个群众组织和他们代表人物的政治观点和实际行动，了解他们的历史和现状，了解他们同上下左右的联系，等等。只有听取了各方面的意见，而不是只听一面之辞，偏听偏信；只有掌握了大量的、全面的情况，而不是只知道一些片面的材料，才能进行科学的分析，作出正确的判断。“……离开了实际情况的调查，就要堕入空想和盲动的深坑。”那是很危险的。
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是分清敌我、识别革命左派的根本。我们必须坚持在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作。必须以毛泽东思想为指针，紧密结合形势发展和斗争实践，针对活思想，广泛深入地向部队进行无产阶级文化大革命和两条路线斗争的教育。要使干部战士深刻理解毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他提出的资产阶级反动路线，充分认识革命小将在无产阶级文化大革命中创建的伟大功勋，同无产阶级革命派建立起深厚的阶级感情。这样，在斗争的关键时刻，部队就能够立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，及时地、正确地发现和识别革命左派，坚决地站在革命左派一边，给予最有力的支持和援助。
    毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，赋予我们军队重大的责任。对此，我军已经作出了贡献。全军同志一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，兢兢业业，戒骄戒躁，虚心听取群众的意见，不断改进自己的工作，更好地支持革命左派，团结大多数群众，狠狠地打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为无产阶级文化大革命作出更大的贡献！　（四月十四日）
