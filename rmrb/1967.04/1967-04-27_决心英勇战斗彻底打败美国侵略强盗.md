Hanoi residents and soldiers, united in their hatred of the enemy, angrily denounce the new war "escalation" crimes of the U.S. imperialists. They are determined to fight bravely and defeat the American aggressors completely. Hanoi and Haiphong residents and soldiers shoot down 11 U.S. planes and capture a batch of American air pirates.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hanoi on the 25th, our correspondent reports: The ferocious U.S. aggressors brazenly sent a large number of planes to once again savagely bomb the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the second-largest city in the north, Haiphong, committing new heinous crimes. This has aroused the extreme indignation of the heroic residents and soldiers of the capital, Hanoi. They pointed out that the American bandits attempt to use new war "escalation" to intimidate the Vietnamese people, which is merely a vain attempt. The Vietnamese people, who have a tradition of brave fighting, will neither be deceived by the "peace talks" tricks of the American bandits and their lackeys nor be frightened by American bombs. The heroic Vietnamese people are determined to carry out the battle call for anti-American national salvation issued by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, to wage the sacred war of liberating the South and unifying the country to the end, and to completely defeat the American aggressors.

At a meeting held by workers' representatives in Hanoi to denounce the crimes of U.S. imperialism, Vice Secretary of the Hanoi Federation of Trade Unions Vu Quoc Tai pointed out that the more frantic the actions of U.S. imperialism, the more severe the failures it will suffer. He emphasized: The working class of Hanoi will forever remember Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call for anti-American national salvation: "The war may last five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be defeated! Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. When the day of victory comes, our people will rebuild our country more magnificently and more splendidly!" The more than 400 worker representatives present at the meeting unanimously passed a letter to the Capital Defense Command. The letter expressed: The workers and staff of the capital are determined to hold a hammer in one hand and a gun in the other, to advance bravely, and to create outstanding achievements on the production and battlefronts, giving the American bandits the punishment they deserve.

More than 500 representatives from various sectors of Hanoi's youth also held a meeting in the evening of the 25th, enthusiastically celebrating the brilliant victories of the residents and soldiers of Hanoi and Haiphong, and angrily condemning the new war "escalation" crimes of the American bandits. The meeting, amid shouts of "Down with U.S. imperialism" and singing of "Liberate the South," passed a resolution calling on all youth in the city to always be vigilant and ready for battle, determined to defend the airspace of the beloved capital and resolutely smash all the crazy "escalations" of the American bandits.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hanoi on the 26th, the heroic residents and soldiers of Hanoi and other places have continued their efforts, today once again severely beating the enemy planes, shooting down 11 U.S. planes, and capturing a batch of American air pirates, giving a resolute and powerful response to the U.S. imperialists' crazy war "escalation." This morning, the residents and soldiers of Haiphong used fierce artillery fire to smash multiple attacks by American bandits, shooting down five U.S. planes and a helicopter that attempted to rescue American air pirates.

At the same time, the residents and soldiers of Quang Ninh Province cooperated closely with those of Haiphong, shooting down one U.S. plane.

This afternoon, the American bandits again recklessly sent planes to attack the suburbs of Hanoi and some residential areas in the provinces of Phu Tho and Vinh Phuc. The residents and soldiers of Hanoi immediately fired vengeful artillery shells, shooting down two U.S. planes and capturing American air pirates. The residents and soldiers of Phu Tho and Vinh Phuc provinces cooperated closely with those of Hanoi, using fierce artillery fire to shoot down two U.S. planes and capture American air pirates.
