The brutal rule of American imperialism and the Chiang bandits in Taiwan has continually provoked strong resistance from the Taiwanese people. Recently, various parts of Taiwan have seen outbreaks of anger against American invaders and Chiang bandit personnel, the destruction of Chiang bandit offices, and incidents of tax resistance. These new acts of resistance by the Taiwanese people reflect the increasing instability of the rule of the American-Chiang bandits.

	Beat the "Mayor"
	According to Taiwanese newspapers, on March 17, about 200-300 residents of Renai Road in Taipei stormed the "Taipei City Government" and beat up the "mayor," Gao Yushu.
	According to the report, these residents were poor local people. The Chiang bandits, claiming that the dilapidated houses where these residents lived were an eyesore to Americans, forcibly demolished them. This atrocity infuriated the residents.
	At noon on the 17th, these residents, risking their lives, stormed the "City Government" to protest, but were rudely rejected by Gao Yushu. The agitated crowd immediately surrounded Gao, with some cursing him, others tearing his clothes, grabbing his tie, and knocking off his glasses. The Chiang bandits hastily mobilized a large number of military police to suppress these innocent people.

	Last year, a flood in Yilan County left thousands of victims homeless and ignored. Recently, more than 600 starving victims angrily surrounded the "Town Hall," denouncing the Chiang bandits' heinous crimes of not caring about the people's lives.

	Ransack the "County Government"
	On March 19, residents of Taoyuan County, in protest against the extortion and blackmail by the Chiang bandits' "County Government," stormed the "County Government" with more than 30 people and beat up Chiang bandit officials.
	According to reports, in the morning of the 19th, these angry crowds shouted "Find the county magistrate to settle accounts" and stormed the "County Government," first smashing the telephone. Then, they smashed everything in sight. The Chiang bandit officials were so frightened that they fled in all directions. Eleven Chiang bandit officials who did not manage to escape were either severely injured or beaten black and blue. A Chiang bandit reporter attempted to take a photo secretly and was caught by the crowd, thrown down the stairs, breaking his leg and dislocating his nose. Soon, the Chiang bandits' security forces, military police, and criminal investigation units, along with a large number of military police and secret agents, arrived to suppress the crowd. The angry crowd, fearless, fought back against the Chiang bandits' military police and secret agents, injuring many of them.

	Taiwanese newspapers also revealed that recently, in Taipei, Taitung, and Hualien, there have been incidents of "prisoners" rioting, killing prison officials, and escaping from prison to seek a way out. Chiang's soldiers in Taipei and Taichung have escaped from barracks, seized weapons, injured pursuers, and disappeared. In Chiayi, Yunlin, and Tainan, the Chiang bandit police who terrorized the countryside have been repeatedly injured.

	Tax Resistance
	Recently, more than ten thousand small and medium-sized business owners across Taiwan protested against the Chiang bandits' repeated tax increases by going to the Chiang bandits' "Legislative Yuan" and "Ministry of Finance" to protest. Soon after, eight performing arts groups in Taiwan also protested against the Chiang bandits' repeated increases in entertainment tax rates, making it impossible for them to make a living.

	In Taipei, Taichung, and Tainan, the Chiang bandits' unreasonable ban on tricycle drivers' operations has provoked strong resistance from local tricycle drivers. Tricycle drivers drove to the local pseudo-government to denounce the Chiang bandits' crime of cutting off their livelihood.

	The state-run Taiwan University Hospital, claiming insufficient funds, openly deducted three-tenths of the patients' meal fees. More than 50 hospitalized patients, unable to bear it, went on a hunger strike to protest.

	Anti-American Flames
	The Taiwanese people, living in misery, have an even deeper hatred for the Chiang bandits' master, American imperialism.

	Recently, in Taipei, five American invaders barged into a restaurant, drank excessively, and assaulted people. When the shop owner asked them to pay, they not only refused to pay a single cent but also assaulted the person. The Taiwanese youths present saw the American invaders' arrogance and were enraged, immediately surrounding them and beating them with chairs, plates, and bottles, until the American bandits fled, bleeding and disheveled.

	Another American sergeant in the invading forces in Taiwan drove recklessly in Kaohsiung, causing three accidents within 200 meters. The local people, enraged, stopped the car and caught the culprit, beating him up. Another American colonel in Taiwan, Grover, who had committed many crimes, was also killed in his residence.

    台湾人民在反抗
    美帝国主义和蒋匪帮在台湾的残暴统治，不断激起台湾同胞的强烈反抗。最近，台湾各地不断爆发出怒打美国侵略者和蒋匪帮人员，捣毁蒋匪帮机关，以及抗捐抗税事件。台湾同胞这些新的反抗活动，反映出美蒋匪帮的统治更加不稳。
    痛打“市长”
    据台湾报纸透露，三月十七日，台北市仁爱路的二、三百名居民，愤怒冲进台北“市政府”，痛打了“市长”高玉树。
    据报道，这些居民都是当地的贫苦市民。蒋匪帮借口这些居民住的破房烂屋，有碍美国人“观瞻”，硬要强行拆除。美蒋匪帮的这一暴行激起了居民们的极大愤怒。
    十七日中午，这些居民冒着生命危险，冲进“市政府”提出抗议，遭到高玉树的蛮横拒绝。激动的群众马上把高玉树团团围住，有的把他痛骂一顿，有的撕破他的衣服，揪住他的领带，打掉了他的眼镜。蒋匪帮慌忙调集大批军警，对这些无辜群众进行镇压。
    去年，宜兰县发生了一次水灾，数以千计的灾民无家可归，无人过问。不久前，六百多名饥饿的灾民愤怒地包围了“镇公所”，控诉蒋匪帮不管老百姓死活的滔天罪行。
    捣毁“县府”
    三月十九日，桃园县居民为抗议蒋匪帮“县政府”对居民的敲诈勒索，三十多人冲进“县政府”，痛打蒋匪帮官员。
    据透露，十九日上午，这些愤怒的群众高喊着“找县长算账”的口号冲进“县政府”，首先砸毁了电话机，然后见物就砸。蒋匪帮官员吓得抱头鼠窜，四散奔逃。没有来得及逃走的十一名蒋匪帮官员，有的被打成重伤，有的被打得鼻青脸肿。一个蒋匪帮记者企图偷拍照片，也被群众揪住，抛下楼梯，摔断了脚骨，摔歪了鼻梁。不久，蒋帮的保安队、宪兵队、刑警队等大批军警特务赶到镇压。愤怒的群众毫不畏惧，又与蒋匪帮军警特务展开搏斗，打伤了许多军警特务。
    台湾报纸还透露，最近，在台北、台东和花莲，都曾发生“犯人”暴动，杀死狱官后集体冲出牢狱，寻找生路的事件。台北、台中等地的蒋军士兵逃出兵营，夺取枪械，打伤追捕人员后去向无踪。在嘉义、云林、台南等地，横行乡里的蒋匪帮警察也不断被人杀伤。
    抗捐抗税
    不久前，台湾全省一万多名中小商人，为反抗蒋匪帮再次提高所得税，分别到蒋匪帮“立法院”、“财政部”提出抗议。紧接着，台湾八个影剧团体也抗议蒋匪帮多次提高娱乐税率，使他们无法维持生计。
    在台北、台中、台南等地，蒋匪帮无理禁止三轮车工人营业，激起了当地三轮车工人的强烈反抗。三轮工人纷纷驾车前往当地的伪政府，声讨蒋匪帮无故断绝工人生路的罪行。
    蒋匪帮官营的台大医院，竟借口经费不足，公然将病人交纳的伙食费抽去三成。住院的五十多名病人忍无可忍，愤怒绝食，表示抗议。
    反美烈火
    生活在水深火热中的台湾同胞，对蒋匪帮的主子美帝国主义更加仇恨。
    不久前，在台北市，五个美国侵略者闯进一家餐厅，酗酒行凶。店主要他们付钱时，他们不但分文不给，反而动手打人。在场的台湾青年看到美国侵略者如此横行霸道，怒火冲天，立刻把他们团团围住，拿起椅凳和杯盘酒瓶，狠砸猛揍，打得美国强盗满头流血，狼狈逃窜。
    另一个侵台美军中士在高雄市驾车横冲直撞，仅在二百米内，就连续肇祸三次。当地人民怒不可遏，冒死拦住汽车，把这个凶手捉住，痛打一顿。另一个在台湾作恶多端的侵台美军中校格鲁佛，也在住宅内被人杀死。
