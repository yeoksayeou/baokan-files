The Somali Journalists Association issued a statement on April 2 condemning the recent pseudo-"Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" held in Beirut, which was orchestrated by Soviet modern revisionists. The association fully supports the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing this year and welcomes the recent establishment of the preparatory committee for this conference in China.

The statement said that the Somali Journalists Association takes this position because a fierce global struggle is underway between revolutionaries and revisionists, and between the forces fighting for liberation, democracy, and socialism and those engaging in division, sabotage, and collusion with imperialism led by the United States.

The statement said, "One of the recent plots by the revisionists is to sow discord among the Afro-Asian people's unity movement, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary struggle ignited by the Afro-Asian peoples against the dark forces of imperialism and reactionaries. This is the greatest service to the forces that seek to enslave the world and keep the people in a state of subjugation."

The statement concluded, "The imperialists and their accomplices will ultimately suffer a complete failure after all their divisive and destructive activities are exposed."

    索马里新闻工作者协会谴责苏修召开贝鲁特分裂会议
    全力支持今年在北京举行亚非作家大会
    据新华社摩加迪沙二日电　索马里新闻工作者协会二日发表声明，谴责最近由苏联现代修正主义者策划在贝鲁特召开的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”，并全力支持今年将在北京举行的第三届亚非作家大会，欢迎最近在中国成立这次大会的筹备委员会。
    声明表示，索马里新闻工作者协会所以采取这一立场，是由于在革命者同修正主义者之间，在争取解放、民主和社会主义的力量同那些从事分裂、破坏团结和勾结以美国为首的帝国主义的势力之间，正在进行着一场世界范围的激烈斗争。
    声明说：“修正主义者最近玩弄的阴谋之一，就是在亚非人民团结运动之间进行挑拨离间，企图扑灭亚非人民为反对帝国主义和反动派的黑暗势力而点燃的革命斗争的烈火。这是对力图奴役世界和使人民处于被奴役地位的势力的最大的效劳。”
    声明最后说：“帝国主义者及其帮凶在他们的一切分裂和破坏活动被揭露后，终将遭到彻底的失败。”
