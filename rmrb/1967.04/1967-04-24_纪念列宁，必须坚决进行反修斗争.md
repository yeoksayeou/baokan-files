	Sri Lankan Communist Party Secretary Samugadasan Says Soviet Revisionist Leaders Are the Biggest Traitors in History
	To Commemorate Lenin, We Must Resolutely Carry Out the Struggle Against Revisionism
	Attitude Towards Mao Zedong Thought Is the Dividing Line Between Marxist-Leninists and Revisionists

	Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, April 22nd – Sri Lankan Communist Party Politburo Member and Secretariat Secretary Samugadasan, on the 22nd, at a report meeting held by the Sri Lankan Communist Party to commemorate the 97th anniversary of the birth of the great Lenin, said that the modern revisionist leadership clique in the Soviet Union has betrayed all the teachings of Lenin, who founded the Soviet state.

	He said that recently, the heads of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique bought two pages of advertising space in the New York Times to attract American monopolistic capital to exploit the Soviet people. They also allowed the Italian Fiat Company to build car factories in the Soviet Union and exploit Soviet workers, and granted the same rights to Japanese monopolistic capitalists to develop Siberia. They implemented the bourgeois material incentive system, expanded the private economy of collective farm members, widened wage gaps, and allowed the most decadent Western culture to infiltrate… All of this shows that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has opened the door to capitalism, allowing capitalism to be restored in the great Lenin's homeland.

	Samugadasan emphasized that in foreign policy, the Soviet revisionist leaders, on the one hand, openly collude with American imperialism and all other reactionary forces, and on the other hand, openly oppose and slander revolutionary China and all other revolutionary movements. The Soviet modern revisionists have proven with their actions that they are the biggest traitors in history, the criminals who have betrayed all of Lenin's teachings.

	Samugadasan said that the best way to commemorate Lenin is to resolutely and uncompromisingly fight against the corruption and influence of modern revisionism on the international communist movement. This struggle is today led by the Communist Party of China and its outstanding leader, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Comrade Mao Zedong.

	In expounding on Lenin's struggle against the revisionist leaders of the Second International, Samugadasan pointed out that Lenin wisely reaffirmed Marx's view: the state is a tool for one class to oppress another, therefore, the bourgeois state machine must be smashed by force and replaced with the state machine of the working class, which is what Marx called the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin advocated that the working class seize power through revolutionary means, and he opposed parliamentarism.

	Lenin not only reaffirmed Marx's theories but also creatively developed them. Most importantly, he put these theories into practice and successfully led the great October Revolution.

	Samugadasan warmly praised Chairman Mao's great contributions to Marxism-Leninism and pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of today. In Lenin's time, those who attacked Lenin were, in essence, attacking Marxism. Similarly, today, those who attack Mao Zedong are, in essence, attacking Marxism-Leninism.

	He stressed that today, the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between revolutionaries and reformists, between Marxist-Leninists and modern revisionists.

    锡共书记桑穆加塔桑说苏修领导人是历史上最大的叛徒
    纪念列宁，必须坚决进行反修斗争
    对待毛泽东思想的态度是区别马列主义者和修正主义者的分界线
    新华社科伦坡二十二日电　锡兰共产党政治局委员、书记处书记桑穆加塔桑，二十二日在锡兰共产党为纪念伟大的列宁诞生九十七周年举行的报告会上发表讲话说，苏联现代修正主义领导集团背叛了创建苏维埃国家的列宁的一切教导。
    他说，最近，苏修统治集团头目出钱购买《纽约时报》的两版篇幅登广告招揽美国垄断资本去剥削苏联人民。他们还让意大利菲亚特公司在苏联兴建汽车制造厂和剥削苏联劳动人民，并给予日本垄断资本家同样的权利去开发西伯利亚。他们实行资产阶级物质刺激制度，扩大集体农庄庄员的私有经济，扩大工资差距，听任最腐朽的西方文化渗入……所有这一切都表明，苏修统治集团已向资本主义敞开大门，任凭资本主义在伟大列宁的故乡复辟。
    桑穆加塔桑强调指出，在对外政策方面，苏修领导人一方面同美帝国主义和一切其他反动势力公开勾结，另一方面对革命的中国和所有其他革命运动公开敌视和诽谤。苏联现代修正主义者已经用自己的行动证明，他们是历史上最大的叛徒，是背叛列宁的一切教导的罪人。
    桑穆加塔桑说，纪念列宁的最好的办法，就是坚决地、毫不妥协地同现代修正主义对国际共产主义运动的腐蚀和影响作斗争。这场斗争今天是由中国共产党及其杰出的领袖、当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志领导的。
    桑穆加塔桑在阐述列宁当年同第二国际的修正主义领导人进行的针锋相对的斗争时指出，列宁英明地重申了马克思的观点：国家是一个阶级镇压另一个阶级的工具，因此必须用暴力来粉碎资产阶级的国家机器，代之以工人阶级的国家机器，这就是马克思所说的无产阶级专政。列宁主张工人阶级用革命的手段夺取政权，他反对议会主义。
    列宁不仅重申了马克思的学说，而且还创造性地发展了这些学说，最重要的是，他把这些学说用到实践中去，成功地领导了伟大的十月革命。
    桑穆加塔桑热烈赞扬毛主席对马克思列宁主义的巨大贡献，并且指出，毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义。在列宁时代，谁攻击列宁，从根本上说就是攻击马克思主义。同样，在今天，谁攻击毛泽东，从根本上说就是攻击马克思列宁主义。
    他强调说：今天，对待毛泽东思想的态度是区别革命者和改良主义者、区别马克思列宁主义者和现代修正主义者的分界线。
