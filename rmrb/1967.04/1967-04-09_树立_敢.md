Chairman Mao has always taught us to dare to struggle and dare to win. In our revolutionary work and production, we must also have this spirit of "daring" to lead the way, so that we can truly become a vanguard force that fights against the heavens and the earth.

After the irrigation canal project started, the leadership required us to complete the task, which was originally scheduled for forty days, ahead of time. This way, we could free up more labor to strengthen field management. I thought: the original task was not light, and now that the time has been moved up, the task is even heavier. I didn't say anything, but I was worried that we might not be able to complete the task on time. Before I could speak, the militia company commander came to talk to me, encouraging me to study "Three Articles" with this issue in mind. I studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and found that I lacked the "dare" spirit compared to the Foolish Old Man. It is precisely because our Chinese people have listened to Chairman Mao's words and carried forward the spirit of "daring" that we have achieved one victory after another. Now, if we do not have the spirit of "daring" to lead the way in building the irrigation canal, how can we achieve victory? Although the task of building the irrigation canal is heavy, as long as we put politics in command, dare to face difficulties, and are not afraid of hardship or fatigue, we will definitely be able to complete the task ahead of time. With such confidence and determination, I started by strengthening ideological work and mobilizing everyone's enthusiasm. The project progressed rapidly, and in less than half a month, we had already completed 70% of the task.

This incident made me realize that to overcome difficulties, we must first not be afraid of them and dare to fight against them. In our revolutionary work, we will often encounter difficulties. If we do not dare to fight against them, we will not be able to accomplish anything, and our revolution will become an empty slogan.

Victory comes from struggle. Only by following Chairman Mao's teachings and struggling with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man who removed the mountains can we achieve revolutionary victory.

    树立“敢”
    字民兵排长　唐文有
    毛主席一贯教导我们要敢于斗争，敢于胜利。我们抓革命，促生产，也要有这种“敢”字当头的革命精神，才能真正成为一支战天斗地的突击队。
    灌溉渠工程开工以后，领导上要求我们把四十天的任务，争取提前完成，以便早些把劳力腾出来去加强田间管理。我想：原来的任务就不轻，现在时间一提前，任务就更重了。我嘴里没说什么，但心里怕不能按时完成任务。还没等我开口，民兵营长就找我谈心，启发我带着这个问题学习“老三篇”。我学习了《愚公移山》，发现我比愚公差一个“敢”字。我们中国人民，正是听了毛主席的话，发扬了“敢”字当头的革命精神，才取得了一个又一个的胜利。现在我们做灌溉渠，没有“敢”字当头的精神，又怎么能够取得胜利呢？做灌溉渠任务虽然很重，但是我们只要突出政治，“敢”字当头，不怕苦、不怕累，一定能够提前完成任务。我有了这样的信心和决心，从加强思想工作入手，调动大家的积极性，工程进展很快，不到半个月时间，就已经完成任务的百分之七十。
    这件事情使我体会到，要战胜困难，首先要不怕困难，敢于和困难作斗争。我们干革命，会经常碰到困难的，如果不敢同困难斗，那就什么事情也干不成了，干革命就成了一句空话。
    胜利是斗争得来的，只有按照毛主席的教导，用愚公移山的精神去斗争，才能取得革命的胜利。
