The broad masses of military and civilian personnel across the nation have resolved to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and learn from the example of the revolutionary masses of the capital. They will thoroughly criticize the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, further strengthen and develop the revolutionary great alliance, and achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

They will actively respond to the call for supporting the army and loving the people, with military and civilian personnel united in heart and shoulder to shoulder, determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: The joyous news of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has spread to various places, and the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary masses are jubilant. They sing with joy the new victory song of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, celebrating the new victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups have expressed their determination to hold high the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance victoriously, thoroughly criticize and expose the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, deeply carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their local areas and units, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, achieving victory in both revolution and production.

In recent days, the entire country has been immersed in a festive atmosphere of revolution. Revolutionary masses inspired by the joyous news of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee have been beating drums, holding rallies, parading, performing artistic programs, and enthusiastically promoting Mao Zedong Thought, celebrating this significant new victory in the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses in our country. Revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary masses in various places have expressed that under the intimate care and guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary masses of the capital have set a good example in achieving great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. The victory of the proletarian revolutionary masses of the capital is our victory; the path taken by the proletarian revolutionary masses of the capital is the path we must take. We will resolutely respond to the battle call issued by Premier Zhou Enlai and Comrade Jiang Qing at the celebration of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, seriously study the speech by Comrade Xie Fuzhi at the meeting, and under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, march forward shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary comrades of the capital, fight together, and win together.

Revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary masses across the country have held discussions after hearing this joyous news. They excitedly said: We have long been looking forward to the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee in Beijing. Because Beijing is the place where the red sun of our hearts, Chairman Mao, resides, the proletarian revolutionary masses have taken power, and can firmly defend Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, giving a head-on blow to the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly uprooting the chief backer of revisionism in our country, ensuring that our socialist motherland remains red forever. The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary masses said, Beijing is the place where our beloved leader Chairman Mao resides, the location of the highest command of the proletarian revolution in our country, and the beacon of hope and light for the liberation of oppressed nations and peoples around the world. Beijing is also the center and birthplace of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee marks the complete collapse of the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and a new, red Beijing shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought stands tall in the East. This will greatly promote the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and will have a profound impact on the revolutionary cause of the proletariat worldwide.

Revolutionary masses of the proletariat in various places have expressed that at the current stage of the proletarian revolutionary masses uniting to seize power, the battle task facing the people of the entire country is to hold high the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the big poisonous weed "In Cultivation," politically, ideologically, and theoretically. At the same time, they must combine the thorough criticism of the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road with the criticism of the small clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road in their provinces, cities, regions, departments, and units. The young revolutionaries of the "Three Commissions" in Hohhot City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said with deep emotion that in our most arduous struggle, the proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing, who came from Chairman Mao's side, had sent their outstanding fighters to join us and fight with us several times. Today, the proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing, under the intimate care and guidance of Chairman Mao, have set a brilliant example for the people of Inner Mongolia and the people of the entire country. We must learn from their spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely push the thorough criticism of the biggest minority of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the small clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road in the Inner Mongolia region to a new high. The warriors of the "August 18th" Red Guards Combat Team in Qinghai Province said, we must learn well from the experience of the proletarian revolutionary masses and Red Guards of Beijing, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more thoroughly, deeply, and comprehensively expose and criticize the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in our province, resolutely repel the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration tide, and achieve great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination in the great criticism and struggle of the revolution.

Revolutionary masses of the proletariat in various places excitedly said: We will forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, attach great importance to the strengthening and consolidation of state power, truly seize power, and use power well. At the same time, we will unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," put revolution in the first place, use revolution to lead production, grasp revolution, and vigorously promote production. We will make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution shine not only in the political and ideological fields but also in the fields of economic construction and scientific research, achieve victory this year, and lay a solid and developing foundation for the Third Five-Year Plan. The fishermen of the Red Flag Combat Team of the Fishery Brigade of Caiyuan Commune in Shengsi County, Zhoushan Fishery District, who had just returned from offshore fishing in the morning, listened to the broadcast in the afternoon. The fishermen said in a discussion: We must learn from the proletarian revolutionary masses of Beijing and resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and make contributions to seizing the current spring tide production and achieving double victories in revolution and production.

The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary masses unanimously expressed: Actively respond to the call for supporting the army and loving the people. They said, at the critical moment when the proletarian revolutionary masses unite to seize power from the small clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, the People's Liberation Army has given firm support to the proletarian revolutionary masses. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and made immortal contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We proletarian revolutionary masses will forever be united in heart with the People's Liberation Army and the proletarian revolutionary masses of the capital, determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary masses in various places, while enthusiastically hailing the birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, have deeply felt that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and completing all tasks. They said, Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time, the strongest ideological weapon of the proletariat. In the thorough criticism of the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, we must further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and in the great criticism, further understand and master Mao Zedong Thought. The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat also expressed their determination to study, fight, and rectify in the great criticism, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to overcome all non-proletarian thoughts in our ranks. At present, we must especially oppose anarchism, further strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, and let the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought forever illuminate our path forward.

According to Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed across the country have enthusiastically celebrated the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. From the coast to the border, from barracks to ships and airfields, everywhere sings "The East Is Red," and everywhere echoes the cheers of "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" They unanimously expressed that they will learn from the proletarian revolutionary masses of the capital, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, thoroughly criticize the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, actively assist the local areas in the great criticism, further strengthen and develop the revolutionary great alliance, achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and build the entire country into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The joyous news of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, like a spring thunder, quickly spread across the country. In recent days, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically cheered the new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. They were moved to tears, their blood boiling, their hearts turning to Beijing. Officers and soldiers have been immersed in a joyous atmosphere. They held celebration meetings, discussion meetings, put up wall newspapers, wrote slogans, held high portraits of Chairman Mao, beat drums and paraded around their stations, celebrating that the capital of China, the beacon of the world revolution—Beijing, has established a revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organ—the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee—under the intimate care of Chairman Mao. Border guards stationed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Pamir Plateau were inspired by the live broadcast of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Border guards under the Kunlun Mountains wrote poems to celebrate: "Good news spreads across ten thousand miles, the capital's flag is even redder. The Kunlun wind and the Yellow River water carry the soldiers' congratulations. Young warriors, revolutionary comrades, you have added glory to the capital, you have made new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. May you pull down the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, may you be the vanguard on the revolutionary road."

Fighting hero Mai Xiande was very excited when he heard the joyous news of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. With immense excitement, he raised his arms and shouted: "Firmly support! Firmly agree! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!"

The broad cadres and soldiers are full of vigor and fighting spirit. While celebrating the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary masses of the capital, they angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee and the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road who supported them. They expressed that we will firmly stand with the proletarian revolutionary masses of the capital and across the country, hold high the banner of revolution and criticism, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen enemy, fiercely pursue and attack the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly settle their accounts for their heinous crimes against the party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly criticize and expose their "In Cultivation." The cadres and soldiers of a certain unit's Eighth Company said, we love Chairman Mao the most. In the years of war, we were fearless of bloodshed and sacrifice to defend Chairman Mao and liberate the people. Today, to defend the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, we are fearless of mountains of knives and seas of fire. We will use our pens as swords and spears, thoroughly criticize the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought across the country and the world!

Cadres and soldiers of the units assisting local work have also seriously studied and discussed the speeches by Premier Zhou Enlai and Comrade Jiang Qing at the celebration of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. They are determined to follow the spirit of the instructions by Premier Zhou Enlai and Comrade Jiang Qing, tightly grasp the direction of the struggle in supporting the revolutionary masses of the left, supporting agriculture, and supporting industrial production work, correctly treat the revolutionary masses, humbly listen to the opinions of the revolutionary masses, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Air Force model soldier Wang Yuchang, who was awarded the title of "Model Soldier for Loving Soldiers," reviewed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "The army must blend with the people, making the army appear as the people's army in the eyes of the people, and this army will be invincible in the world..." He said, we will firmly respond to the call for loving the people and supporting the army proposed by Comrade Jiang Qing on behalf of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and resolutely implement the eight orders of the Central Military Commission and the ten orders.

A platoon leader, He Jinbao, who was awarded the second-class merit for his bravery in the stormy sea and was praised as the "Living Xie Sheng," said, we are the children of the people, forever united with the people, and everything we do is for the people's interests, which is the sole purpose of our army and the highest principle for every revolutionary soldier's actions. In the current struggle to support the proletarian revolutionary masses, we must better carry forward the glorious traditions of our army, love the people infinitely, forever be united with the people, and thoroughly criticize the biggest clique of power holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, creating new merits for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The comrades of the "Political Border Model Company" in a certain unit in Kunming said after hearing the joyous news of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, we will firmly learn from the proletarian revolutionary masses of the capital and the cadres and soldiers of the units stationed in Beijing, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and make the company and the border a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!
