The theoretical journal of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, "The Party's Road," published in its March issue an article by H. Zeneli titled "Only by Waging an Uncompromising Struggle Against Revisionism and Without the Participation of Revisionists Can True Revolutionary Unity of the World Proletariat Be Achieved." The article points out that to successfully wage the Marxist-Leninist struggle against Soviet modern revisionism, it is of the utmost importance to establish true revolutionary unity of the world proletariat at present.

The article states that modern revisionists are the splitters of the international communist movement and the enemies of the unity of revolutionary forces in the world. The Khrushchev revisionists are the greatest splitters of the contemporary international communist movement and the most dangerous traitors in the history of the communist movement.

The article points out that the struggle between Marxism-Leninism on one side and revisionism and opportunism on the other is an objective reality, a fierce manifestation of class struggle, and a life-and-death struggle between the revolutionary proletariat and the bourgeoisie and other reactionary forces. Whether on a global scale or within individual countries, wherever revisionism and opportunism emerge and flourish, splits are inevitable. The splits between Marxist-Leninist, revolutionary forces and opportunist, counter-revolutionary forces become historical necessities. Every split in the communist movement is caused by the emergence of revisionist and opportunist lines, and is caused by the betrayal of the proletariat and the Marxist-Leninist cause by opportunists. No matter who it is, once he betrays Marxism-Leninism, he breaks the unity of the proletariat and becomes a splitter.

The article says that the current revolutionary movement is developing and growing stronger. In the revisionist countries, Marxism-Leninism and revolutionary forces are increasingly strongly opposing the betrayal and degeneration of the revisionists. For this reason, the imperialists and their agents, the Khrushchev revisionists, are in a state of panic and anxiety in the face of the rising revolutionary tide of the proletariat and the peoples of various countries, and the growing strength of Marxist-Leninist forces around the world. On the one hand, they are intensifying their opposition to Marxist-Leninist forces and revolutionary forces in revisionist countries, and strengthening their cooperation with American imperialists; on the other hand, they are strengthening their deceptive propaganda of "united action," "anti-imperialism," and so on.

The article says that no matter how cunning the deceptive propaganda and tricks of the Khrushchev revisionists are, they cannot cover up the facts or deceive the true Marxist-Leninist forces and the revolutionary peoples of various countries. The facts show that the Khrushchev modern revisionists are increasingly strengthening their counter-revolutionary cooperation with international imperialism and its ringleader, American imperialism, in order to strengthen their struggle against Marxism-Leninism, revolution, and socialism. The visit of one of the leaders of the Soviet revisionists, Podgorny, to the Pope in Rome, the traitor Kosygin's trip to London, and the recent secret negotiations between the Soviet revisionist leadership and American imperialists to bring the Vietnamese issue into the orbit of Soviet-American cooperation, all serve this counter-revolutionary purpose.

The article points out that the betrayal of the Khrushchev revisionists has placed them outside the ranks of the international communist movement and outside the anti-imperialist united front of the peoples of various countries.

The article emphasizes that when the Khrushchev revisionists and the imperialists form an alliance and jointly hatch new plots against socialism, revolution, and Marxism-Leninism, no true revolutionary communist can stand idly by in this struggle, but must shoulder the full responsibility bestowed by history and resolutely join the struggle against revisionism. The experience of the world revolutionary movement, especially the struggle against the opportunism of the Second International, shows how harmful it is to adopt a hesitant, wavering, and unsteady attitude in the struggle against revisionism. Such an attitude only benefits the revisionists. There is no middle ground in the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism, and there can be no "united action" with modern revisionists. Anyone who advocates "united action" with these traitors will become a traitor, because Marxism-Leninism and revisionism are incompatible, and they are mortal enemies.

The article points out that the middle line, the "fence-sitting" line, is untenable and is a transitional stage to opportunist positions, or a trick to cover up opportunism and prolong its life. Anyone who disguises himself as a "neutral" will slide into the position of an opportunist and support the revisionists. The issue is so clearly put: either stand with Marxism-Leninism, revolution, and socialism against revisionism, or stand with revisionism against Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and join the counter-revolutionaries. There is no third way.

The article says that the revisionists are doing everything in their power to rally their scattered forces and intensify their attacks on Marxist-Leninist forces, opposing the burgeoning world revolutionary movement. Now Brezhnev, Kosygin, Tito, Johnson, and the Pope have formed a united front of imperialism and revisionism against the freedom and independence of the peoples of various countries, against revolution and socialism. Therefore, all true Marxist-Leninist revolutionary forces must unite their ranks in every country and on an international scale to counter and smash the reactionary attacks of imperialism and revisionism.

The article says that for the cooperation and joint action of various Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations, it is an urgent task to establish close internationalist ties, which is of great significance for the fate of revolution and socialism, and for carrying the struggle of Marxism-Leninism against revisionism to a thorough victory. Faced with the counter-revolutionary united front of imperialism and revisionism, a united front of revolutionary and Marxist-Leninist forces of various countries must be established. It is for this reason that the representatives attending the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, the representatives of Marxist-Leninist forces of various countries, support the proposal of the Party of Labour of Albania: to establish revolutionary unity of contemporary Marxist-Leninist forces, and to closely unite with the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China, in order to build an iron wall that will make all the enemies of Marxism-Leninism, revolution, and socialism suffer a crushing defeat. It is for this reason that the revisionists are doing everything in their power to split the Marxist-Leninist forces and prevent them from organizing and uniting.

The article concludes that the international situation and the situation of the world communist movement are favorable to us and unfavorable to our enemies, the imperialists and revisionists. The new revolutionary unity of Marxist-Leninist forces established in the struggle against revisionism, without the participation of revisionists, will raise the struggle against imperialism and revisionism to a higher stage, and will carry this struggle to victory for the working class and the peoples of various countries over the bourgeoisie and imperialism and their agents, the Khrushchev and Tito revisionists, ensuring the victory of revolution and socialism throughout the world.

### 建立世界无产阶级的真正革命团结

    阿尔巴尼亚党刊载文阐述马列主义者在当前反修斗争中的重大任务
    建立世界无产阶级的真正革命团结
    马列主义同修正主义斗争中没有中间道路，真正共产党人必须投入反修斗争苏修是大叛徒，不能参加反帝统一战线；绝不能同叛徒搞“联合行动”
    新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央机关理论刊物《党的道路》今年三月号，发表了哈·泽纳利写的一篇题为《只有同修正主义进行毫不调和的斗争，并在没有修正主义者参加的情况下，才能达到世界无产阶级的真正革命团结》的文章。文章指出，为了胜利地进行马克思列宁主义反对苏联现代修正主义的斗争，在当前建立世界无产阶级的真正革命团结具有最重大的意义。
    文章说，现代修正主义者是国际共产主义运动的分裂者和世界革命力量团结的敌人。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是当代国际共产主义运动的最大分裂者和共产主义运动历史上最危险的叛徒。
    文章指出，以马克思列宁主义为一方，以修正主义和机会主义为另一方的斗争，是客观的存在，是阶级斗争的激烈表现，是革命的无产阶级同资产阶级以及其他反动势力之间你死我活的斗争。不管是在世界范围内，还是在个别的国家中，哪里产生和滋长着修正主义与机会主义，哪里分裂就不可避免，马克思列宁主义的、革命的力量同机会主义的、反革命的力量的分裂就成为历史的必然。共产主义运动中的每一分裂都是由于修正主义和机会主义路线的产生而引起的，都是由于机会主义者对无产阶级、马克思列宁主义事业的背叛所引起的。不管是谁，只要他背叛了马克思列宁主义，那么他就破坏了无产阶级的团结，他就是分裂者。
    文章说，当前革命运动正在发展和日益壮大；在修正主义国家中，马克思列宁主义和革命的力量愈来愈强烈地反对修正主义者的背叛和堕落。正因为如此，帝国主义者及其代理人赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，在无产阶级和各国人民日益高涨的革命浪潮、在全世界马克思列宁主义力量的增长面前慌作一团，惊慌不安。一方面，他们加紧反对马克思列宁主义力量，反对修正主义国家中的革命力量，加紧和美帝国主义者合作；另一方面，他们加强了“联合行动”、“反帝”等的欺骗宣传。
    文章说，不管赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的蛊惑人心的宣传和欺骗伎俩有多么狡猾，也抹煞不了事实，也欺骗不了真正的马克思列宁主义力量和各国革命人民。事实表明，赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者正在越来越加强同国际帝国主义及其元凶美帝国主义的反革命合作，以便加强他们反对马克思列宁主义、反对革命和社会主义的斗争。苏修头目之一波德戈尔内登门拜访罗马教皇，叛徒柯西金伦敦之行，苏修领导集团和美帝国主义者最近为把越南问题纳入美苏合作的轨道而进行的秘密谈判，都是为这个反革命目的服务的。
    文章指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的背叛已把自己置于国际共产主义运动的队伍之外，置于各国人民的反帝统一战线之外。
    文章强调指出，当赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和帝国主义者结成了同盟，一起策划反对社会主义、反对革命和马克思列宁主义的新阴谋时，任何一个真正的革命的共产党人都不能在这场斗争中袖手旁观，而应承担起历史所赋予他的全部职责，坚决投入到反对修正主义的斗争中去。世界革命运动的经验、特别是反对第二国际机会主义的斗争经验表明，在反对修正主义的斗争中采取犹豫、动摇和不坚定的态度是多么有害。这种态度只有利于修正主义者。在马克思列宁主义同现代修正主义的斗争中间不可能有中间道路，同现代修正主义者不可能有任何“联合行动”。谁鼓吹同这些叛徒搞联合行动，谁就会变成叛徒，因为马克思列宁主义同修正主义是水火不相容的，是你死我活的仇敌。
    文章指出，中间路线、“骑墙路线”，是站不住脚的，是滑向机会主义立场的过渡站，或者是掩盖机会主义、延长机会主义寿命的花招。谁把自己打扮成“中立者”，谁就滑入机会主义者的立场，并支持修正主义者。问题就是这样明显地摆着：要么同马克思列宁主义、革命、社会主义在一起反对修正主义，要么同修正主义一起反对马克思列宁主义，反对社会主义，和反革命同流合污。第三条道路是没有的。
    文章说，修正主义者正在千方百计地纠集他们的四分五裂的力量，加紧攻击马克思列宁主义力量，反对正在蓬勃发展的世界革命运动。现在勃列日涅夫、柯西金、铁托、约翰逊之流以及罗马教皇已经组成了帝国主义、修正主义反对各国人民自由和独立、反对革命和社会主义的联合战线。因此，所有真正的马克思列宁主义革命力量必须在每一个国家中和在国际范围内联合自己的队伍，以对抗和粉碎帝国主义、修正主义的反动攻击。
    文章说，为了各个马克思列宁主义政党和组织之间的合作和共同行动，建立国际主义的密切联系是当前的紧迫任务，它对于革命和社会主义的命运，对于把马克思列宁主义反对修正主义的斗争进行到彻底胜利来说具有重大意义。面对着帝国主义、修正主义的反革命联合战线，必须建立起各国革命和马克思列宁主义力量的联合战线。正是出于这一原因，出席阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的代表，各国马克思列宁主义力量的代表支持阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的主张：建立当代马克思列宁主义力量的革命团结，和中国共产党、中华人民共和国紧密地团结在一起，以便建立一个使马克思列宁主义、革命和社会主义的一切敌人碰得头破血流的铜墙铁壁。正是出于这一原因，修正主义者才千方百计地分裂马克思列宁主义力量，阻止他们组织和团结起来。
    文章最后说，国际形势和世界共产主义运动的形势有利于我们而不利于我们的敌人帝国主义者和修正主义者。在没有修正主义者参加的情况下，在反修斗争中建立起来的新的革命团结的马克思列宁主义力量，将把反帝、反修的斗争提到一个更高的阶段，将把这场斗争进行到工人阶级和各国人民取得对资产阶级和帝国主义以及他们的代理人赫鲁晓夫、铁托修正主义的胜利，保证革命和社会主义在全世界取得胜利。
