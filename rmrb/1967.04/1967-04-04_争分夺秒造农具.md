The Seventh Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed near Qing Shan Brigade in Baishan, Sichuan, learned that due to the sabotage by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the "ghosts and monsters" (class enemies), some of the main spring plowing tools, such as plows, paddies leveling frames, and water wheels, were either broken or worn out and had not been repaired or replaced. Spring plowing was imminent, seriously threatening this year's grain production increase. The soldiers, upon hearing this, indignantly said, "War needs weapons, spring plowing needs tools. The enemy wants to sabotage spring plowing by destroying farming tools, but they will never succeed." Therefore, they decided to immediately organize a carpentry team to support Qing Shan Brigade.

At that time, in the carpentry workshop of Qing Shan Brigade, two carpentry comrades were rushing to make two paddy leveling frames for two production brigades. However, the time was tight, and the tools were insufficient, making it difficult to complete the task immediately. At this critical moment, the carpentry team from the Seventh Company arrived with a large pile of tools, and the workshop immediately became lively. They started working together, some pulling, some drilling, and when they encountered technical difficulties, they discussed them together. After an afternoon of intense labor, two paddy leveling frames were completed.

    争分夺秒造农具
    解放军驻四川壁山某部七连驻地附近的青山大队，由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和牛鬼蛇神的破坏，一些主要的春耕农具，如“犁耙”、
  “秧田板架”、“水车”等，破的破，烂的烂，一直没有修理添置。春耕迫在眉睫，严重威胁着今年的粮食增产。战士们知道了这一情况，愤慨地说：“打仗要武器，春耕要农具，敌人想以毁坏农具来破坏春耕，万万办不到。”于是他们决定立即组织一个木工组到青山大队支援。
    当时，青山大队的木工房里有两个木工同志正在给两个生产队赶制两块平秧田的板架，可是时间太紧，工具又缺，很难马上完成。正在这个紧张时刻，七连木工组带着一大堆工具来支援了，木工房顿时欢腾起来。他们马上一起动手，拉的拉，钻的钻，遇到技术难题又一起商量。经过一个下午的紧张劳动，两块平秧田的板架就赶制出来了。
