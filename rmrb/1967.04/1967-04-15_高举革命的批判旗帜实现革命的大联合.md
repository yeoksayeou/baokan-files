The People's Daily published a report on April 13 about the revolutionary students of Shanghai No. 6 Girls' School, who, in the course of criticizing and struggling against the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line he represents, achieved revolutionary unity throughout the school. At the same time, it reprinted the editorial "Again on Promoting Unity Through Criticism" from the Wenhui Daily. This report and editorial raise a very important issue in the current proletarian cultural revolution.

The experience of Shanghai No. 6 Girls' School and the editorial in the Wenhui Daily point out that achieving revolutionary unity through revolutionary criticism, and seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, is the current direction of the revolutionary struggle. The reactionary bourgeois line is the main obstacle to the unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. To criticize the reactionary bourgeois line, we must direct our arrows at the top capitalist-roader within the Party, and link this struggle closely with the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform in our own region, department, and unit. Through joint struggle, we can achieve revolutionary unity. We believe these principles are correct and universally applicable.

Uniting the masses and the majority of cadres, and concentrating our efforts to strike at a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, is an important guiding ideology of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. However, the reactionary bourgeois line represented by the top capitalist-roader within the Party does the opposite. They direct the spearhead of the struggle at the masses, creating serious antagonism among the masses. In the matter of cadres, they implement the reactionary policy of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number." They do this to shield a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, maintain their reactionary rule, and conspire to restore capitalism.

Therefore, we must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, direct our criticism, struggle, and exposure at the top capitalist-roader within the Party, at a handful of capitalist-roaders in our own region, department, and unit, and at the reactionary bourgeois line they adhere to. If we take the masses who have been deceived by the reactionary bourgeois line as the main target of our struggle, we will let the real enemy escape, hinder revolutionary unity, and weaken and disperse the firepower of our criticism against the top capitalist-roader within the Party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. We must not do this.

It must be pointed out that the unity we speak of is revolutionary unity, unity in adhering to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, unity in the common struggle to criticize a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; it is not a hodgepodge of revolutionary organizations of the proletariat and conservative organizations that adhere to the reactionary bourgeois line. However, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat should, according to Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, use the formula of "unity-criticism-unity" to patiently help those who have joined conservative organizations. In the struggle to expose and criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, we should strive to win over and educate them, make them realize that they too are victims of the reactionary bourgeois line, and thus rise up to oppose conservative organizations, break with the reactionary bourgeois line, and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. For the small number of leaders in conservative organizations who stubbornly adhere to wrong views, we should expose and criticize them, making them isolated in the masses. For reactionary organizations like the "Joint Action Committee," we should resolutely strike them down, completely dismantle them, and punish their ringleaders according to law. Only in this way can we consolidate and expand the unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: We must strive to unite with all those who can be united. The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also to liberate all of humanity. If we cannot liberate all of humanity, the proletariat itself cannot ultimately be liberated. At present, we must especially remember Chairman Mao's great teaching.

Revolutionary unity must be clear-cut, persistent in struggle, have the necessary conditions, and pay attention to methods.

Clear-cut means that revolutionary unity must be achieved on the basis of the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought must be used as a weapon to criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line he represents, and that resolute revolutionary leftists must be the core leadership of the unity.

Persistent in struggle means that in the struggle against the top capitalist-roader within the Party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, in the struggle to thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois line, we must promote and achieve revolutionary unity.

Having the necessary conditions means that the revolutionary masses of the proletariat who adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line must be in the majority, and must be supported and trusted by the broad revolutionary masses.

Paying attention to methods means that we must vigorously advocate, seriously guide, and inspire the masses to voluntarily achieve revolutionary unity. We must not simply use administrative orders to dissolve revolutionary mass organizations and merge them into one.

All deceived masses and cadres who have made mistakes must, in this great criticism, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the reactionary bourgeois line on themselves, must resolutely support the revolutionary faction, learn from the revolutionary faction, and move closer to the revolutionary faction. If one harbors resistance and dissatisfaction towards the revolutionary faction, not only will one not correct one's mistakes, but one may even be used by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to become a tool for their restoration of capitalism.

Comrades in the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, revolutionary comrades, let us, under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, in the common struggle to criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line he represents, unite closely and march forward on the victorious path of the proletarian cultural revolution!

### 高举革命的批判旗帜实现革命的大联合

    高举革命的批判旗帜实现革命的大联合
    本报十三日刊登了上海市第六女中革命小将，在对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线进行大批判、大斗争中，实现了全校革命的大联合的消息。同时，转载了《文汇报》《再论在大批判中推进大联合》的社论。这个消息和社论，提出了当前无产阶级文化大革命中一个极为重要的问题。
    上海市第六女中的经验和《文汇报》的社论指出，在革命的大批判中实现革命的大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，这是当前革命斗争的大方向。资产阶级反动路线是当前实现无产阶级革命派大联合的主要障碍。要批判资产阶级反动路线，必须把矛头直指党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，并且把这场斗争同本地区、本部门、本单位的斗、批、改任务紧密结合起来，通过共同的斗争，实现革命的大联合。我们认为，这些原则是正确的，普遍适用的。
    团结群众和干部的大多数，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的重要指导思想。而以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线，却反其道而行之。他们把斗争的矛头指向群众，制造群众与群众之间的严重对立。他们在干部问题上，实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策。他们这样做，是为了包庇一小撮反革命修正主义分子，维持他们的反动统治，阴谋实行资本主义复辟。
    因此，我们一定要紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，向本地区、本部门、本单位的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，向他们所坚持的资产阶级反动路线进行大揭露，大批判，大斗争。如果我们把受过资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众作为斗争的主要目标，那就会放跑了真正的敌人，妨碍了革命的大联合，减弱和分散了对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子大批判的火力。我们绝不能这样做。
    必须指出，我们说的大联合，是革命的大联合，是坚持毛主席无产阶级革命路线的大联合，是在批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的共同斗争中的大联合；而不是无产阶级革命派组织和坚持资产阶级反动路线的保守派组织的大杂烩。但是，无产阶级革命派对于参加保守派组织的群众，应当按照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，运用“团结——批评——团结”的公式，耐心地帮助他们。在控诉和批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子的斗争中，争取、教育他们，使他们认识到自己也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，从而起来造保守派组织的反，跟资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。对于保守派组织中顽固坚持错误观点的极少数头头，则应当加以揭露、批判，使他们在群众中孤立起来。对“联动”那样的反动组织，应该坚决打击，彻底瓦解，对其首恶分子，必须依法惩办。只有这样，才能巩固和扩大无产阶级革命派的大联合。
  毛主席一再教导我们：要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。当前，我们特别要牢记毛主席的这一伟大教导。
    革命的大联合，必须旗帜鲜明，坚持斗争，具备条件，讲究方法。
    旗帜鲜明，就是必须在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现革命的大联合，必须用战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线进行大批判的战斗武器，必须以坚定的革命左派作为大联合的领导核心。
    坚持斗争，就是必须在向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子的斗争中，在彻底批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，推进革命的大联合，实现革命的大联合。
    具备条件，就是坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无产阶级革命派必须占优势，并且受到广大革命群众的支持和信任。
    讲究方法，就是要大力提倡，认真引导，启发群众的自觉和自愿来实现革命的大联合。不能简单地用行政命令的办法解散革命群众组织，搞“合二而一”的大合并。
    一切受蒙蔽的群众和犯了错误的干部，都必须在这场大批判中彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线对自己的毒害，必须坚决支持革命派，向革命派学习，向革命派靠拢。如果对革命派抱着抵触和不满情绪，那就不但不能改正自己的错误，甚至可能被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所利用，充当他们进行资本主义复辟的工具。
    无产阶级革命派的战友们，革命的同志们，让我们在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，在对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线进行大批判的共同战斗中，紧密地联合起来，在无产阶级文化大革命的胜利大道上阔步前进！
