	Implementing the "Do" Spirit
		Militia Member Yuan Guoyin

	Having established the spirit of "Dare," we must also implement the spirit of "Do," because there is a gap between "resolution" and "victory." Having made a resolution, we must act on it to achieve victory. To "do" means to act as Chairman Mao has instructed, fearlessly and overcoming all difficulties. During the spring plowing season, I studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and prepared myself for hardships. However, whenever I encountered difficulties, I often couldn't withstand them. One morning, the leadership assigned me to take seven militia members to dig around the flour mill. They instructed us to complete the task that day. This was a challenging assignment, and I felt a bit daunted. As soon as this feeling arose, I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to strive for victory." I realized that I was wrong. I thought, doing revolution means fearing no sacrifice and overcoming all difficulties. Originally, I thought that "doing" was simple, just one word, three strokes, as long as you have the strength. At that moment, I realized that truly implementing the spirit of "doing" is not an easy task; it also requires repeated struggles. I fought against my selfishness and immediately led the militia members to tackle the task. Together, we worked hard and completed the digging in just half a day.

	This incident illustrates what? It shows that the spirit of "dare" and "do" are inseparable. Establishing the spirit of "dare" and making a resolution is the starting point; implementing the spirit of "do" with a fearless attitude to overcome all difficulties is how the resolution is realized. Currently, it is the peak of the spring plowing season. No matter the circumstances, we should act on our words, work hard and diligently, and do it thoroughly. We should make the first shot of the spring plowing season resound even louder.

### 落实“干”字

    落实“干”字 
    民兵　袁国银
    树立了“敢”字，还必须落实“干”字，因为从“决心”到“胜利”有段距离，下定了决心还要干，才能取得胜利。干，就是要象毛主席指示的那样，不怕牺牲地干，排除万难地干。在春耕生产中，我学习了《愚公移山》，做了一些吃苦的准备。但是一碰到困难，往往就顶不住了。有一天上午，领导上要我带七个民兵到粉坊里挖粉磨周围的土，交代我们要在当天完成。这任务比较艰巨，我有点畏难情绪。这种情绪刚冒头，我想起了毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，就感到自己很不对头。我想，干革命就是要不怕牺牲，排除万难。原来，我以为
  “干”字很简单，说起来一个字，写起来三笔划，只要有力气就行了，这时候，我才想到要真正把“干”字落实到行动中去，并不是一件容易的事情，也要经过反复的斗争。我狠斗了“私”字，立即带领民兵去突击，和大家齐心合力干，只半天时间，就把土挖清了。
    这件事说明了什么问题呢？说明了“敢”字和“干”字是分不开的。树立了“敢”字，下定了决心，才干得起来；落实了“干”字，用不怕牺牲的精神去排除万难，下定的决心才能实现。当前正是闹春耕的时候，我们不论在什么情况下，都应该说干就干，苦干实干，干就干好，干就干彻底，把春耕第一炮打得更响。
