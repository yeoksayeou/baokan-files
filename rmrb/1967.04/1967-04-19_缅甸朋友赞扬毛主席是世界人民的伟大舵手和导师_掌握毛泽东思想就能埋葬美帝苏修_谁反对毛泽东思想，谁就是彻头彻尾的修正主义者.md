Many Burmese friends have boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They praise Chairman Mao as the great leader of the world's revolutionary people and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the priceless treasure of the world's revolutionary people.

Several Burmese workers recently asked a Xinhua News Agency reporter for copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They said, "The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. People in their struggles use this great thought as a weapon and will surely bury the number one enemy of the world's people, American imperialism, and its accomplice, Soviet modern revisionism."

They said, "American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are now colluding to oppose China. They furiously attack Chairman Mao Zedong and the People's Republic of China, but this does nothing to harm the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, and the revolutionary stronghold, the People's Republic of China. Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in the hearts of the world's people. Revolutionary people all over the world love him, respect him, and trust him!"

They said, "The 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' is a priceless treasure for revolutionaries. It is the guide for the daily actions of revolutionary people. A ship sailing on the sea needs a helmsman. The great helmsman of the world's revolutionary ship is our eternal red sun, Mao Zedong!"

Recently, four Burmese friends asked a Xinhua News Agency reporter for copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." These friends had previously obtained copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," but all were taken by their friends. These Burmese friends spoke passionately about the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and enthusiastically recited many famous quotations of Chairman Mao. They said, "Every sentence in this red treasure book shines with the light of truth," the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is the guide for the revolution, "Chairman Mao's works are like air, not a moment can a revolutionary do without it!"

A Burmese friend from the education sector recently spoke emotionally to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, saying, "If I had the chance to meet Chairman Mao, I would tightly grasp his hand and shout from the bottom of my heart: 'Chairman Mao, I wish you eternal life!'"

This Burmese friend said, "Chairman Mao's books are an inexhaustible treasure trove of theory. Every sentence in Chairman Mao's works is truth!" He said, "Since the Soviet leadership betrayed Marxism-Leninism and took the road of revisionism, the center of world revolution has shifted from Moscow to Beijing. The responsibility of leading the world's people in revolutionary struggles has fallen on the shoulders of Chairman Mao Zedong. Today, revolutionary people all over the world are looking at the holy land of world revolution—Beijing, and looking up to the red sun in the hearts of all people—the Mao Zedong. Today, people of all countries who want revolution, who want to struggle, who want to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, must read Chairman Mao's books."

This Burmese friend talked about his experience in studying the "Three Articles" and said, "I love to read the 'Three Articles' the most because 'in these three brilliant works, Chairman Mao raised the most fundamental question for a revolutionary's life. For all revolutionaries, these three articles are the most important textbooks.' He enthusiastically shouted, 'Long live our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao! Wish him eternal life!'"

A Burmese writer said, "Chairman Mao works day and night for the revolutionary cause of the world's people. He supports the world's revolutionary people, and the world's revolutionary people support him. He loves the world's revolutionary people, and the world's revolutionary people love him. Every word in his works shines with revolutionary light! Chairman Mao's wise judgments inspire the people to 'make up their minds, not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.' The Chinese people have such an extraordinarily great revolutionary leader, which is their greatest happiness and glory. The world's revolutionary people have such a great revolutionary helmsman and teacher as Chairman Mao, which is also their greatest happiness and glory!"

This Burmese writer said, "Mao Zedong is the most outstanding great leader of the world's revolutionary people in contemporary times. All the victories won by the world's revolutionary people in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism are inseparable from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, Mao Zedong is the greatest politician in the world, and all revolutionary people of the world love him the most!"

He also pointed out, "In today's world, those who support Mao Zedong Thought are true revolutionaries; those who oppose Mao Zedong Thought are enemies of the revolution. In the international communist movement, those who support Mao Zedong Thought are true Marxist-Leninists; those who oppose Mao Zedong Thought are thoroughgoing revisionists!"

    缅甸朋友赞扬毛主席是世界人民的伟大舵手和导师
    掌握毛泽东思想就能埋葬美帝苏修
    谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是彻头彻尾的修正主义者
    据新华社仰光电　许多缅甸朋友无限热爱毛主席，无限崇拜毛泽东思想。他们称赞毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大领袖，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的无价之宝。
    几位缅甸工人最近向新华社记者索取《毛主席语录》时说，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。人民在斗争中用这一伟大思想作为武器，一定能够埋葬世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶苏联现代修正主义。
    他们说，美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派现在勾结起来反华，它们疯狂地攻击毛泽东主席和中华人民共和国，但是这丝毫无损于世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席和世界革命的堡垒中华人民共和国。毛主席是世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳。全世界革命人民热爱他、尊敬他和信任他！
    他们说，《毛泽东选集》是革命人民的无价之宝。它是革命人民日常行动的指南。大海航行靠舵手。世界革命航船的伟大舵手是我们心中永远不落的红太阳毛泽东！
    不久前，有四位缅甸朋友向新华社记者索取《毛主席语录》。这些朋友已经几次要去了《毛主席语录》，但是全都被他们的朋友拿走了。这几位缅甸朋友在谈话中满怀激情地称颂《毛主席语录》，并且热情地背诵毛主席的许多著名的警句。他们说：“这本红色宝书里的每一句话都闪耀着真理的光辉”，《毛主席语录》“是革命的指南”，“毛主席的著作好比空气，每个革命者一刻也离不开它！”
    一位缅甸教育界朋友最近充满感情地对新华社记者说，如果我有机会见到毛主席，我要紧紧地握住他的手，尽情高呼：
  “毛主席，我祝您万寿无疆！”
    这位缅甸朋友说：
  “毛主席的书是用之不竭的理论宝库。毛主席的著作，句句是真理！”他说：
  “自从苏联领导集团背叛了马克思列宁主义和走上修正主义道路以来，世界革命的中心已经从莫斯科移到北京，领导世界人民进行革命斗争的重担就落在毛泽东主席的肩上了。今天，世界革命人民都注视着世界革命的圣地——北京，仰望着全世界人民心中的红太阳——毛泽东。今天，世界各国人民要革命，要斗争，要反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，就得读毛主席的书。”
    这位缅甸朋友谈到他学习“老三篇”的体会时说，他最爱读“老三篇”，因为“在这三篇光辉的著作中，毛主席提出了对于一个革命者一生最根本的问题。对一切革命者来说，这三篇文章是最最重要的课本。”他热情地高呼：“我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！祝他万寿无疆！”
    一位缅甸作家说：“毛主席日日夜夜地为世界人民的革命事业操劳。他支持世界革命人民，世界革命人民支持他。他热爱世界革命人民，世界革命人民敬爱他。他的著作中的每一个字都发出革命的光辉！毛主席的英明论断鼓舞人民‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’中国人民有这样一位无比伟大的革命领袖，是他们的极大幸福和光荣。世界革命人民有毛主席这样的伟大革命舵手和导师同自己在一起，这也是他们的极大幸福和光荣！”
    这位缅甸作家说：“毛泽东是当代世界革命人民最杰出的伟大领袖。世界革命人民在反对帝国主义和修正主义斗争中所赢得的一切胜利，同战无不胜的毛泽东思想是分不开的。因此，毛泽东是世界上最伟大的政治家，全世界的革命人民最最敬爱他！”
    他还指出：“在今天的世界上，谁拥护毛泽东思想，谁就是真正的革命者；谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是革命的敌人。在国际共产主义运动中，谁拥护毛泽东思想，谁就是真正的马克思列宁主义者；谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是彻头彻尾的修正主义者！”
