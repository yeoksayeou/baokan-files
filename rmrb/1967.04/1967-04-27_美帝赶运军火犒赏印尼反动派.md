The recent anti-China and anti-Chinese wave launched by the right-wing military regime in Indonesia has greatly pleased its master, U.S. imperialism, which hurriedly airlifted a batch of military supplies to Jakarta as a reward on the 25th.

According to reports from Western news agencies, this batch of "military aid" for the Indonesian armed forces to build roads was transported by U.S. Air Force transport planes. U.S. military aircraft will continue to transport excavators and road-building machine parts weighing 200 tons to Jakarta.

The flattered right-wing military leaders of Indonesia, led by Suharto, specially dispatched his assistant for defense affairs, Hartono, to the airport to receive this batch of rewards. Hartono revealed that this "military aid" is just part of a "military aid" plan recently agreed upon by U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Green and Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik. Hartono also revealed that, according to this "military aid" plan, the United States will also provide other equipment urgently needed by the Indonesian armed forces at present, including 120 trucks.

    美帝赶运军火犒赏印尼反动派
    新华社二十六日讯　雅加达消息：印尼右派军人政权最近掀起的新的反华排华浪潮，使它的主子美帝国主义大为高兴，赶忙在二十五日向雅加达空运了一批军事物资，作为犒赏。
    据西方通讯社报道，这批供印尼武装部队修路用的“军援”物资是由美国空军运输机运到的。美国军用飞机将继续向雅加达运送重达二百吨的掘土机和修路机零件。
    受宠若惊的印尼右派军人政权头目苏哈托当天特地派出他的国防事务助理哈托诺赶到机场领取了这批犒赏。哈托诺透露，这批“军事援助”，只是由美国驻印尼大使格林和印尼外交部长马利克最近达成的一项“军事援助”计划中的一部分。哈托诺还透露，根据这个“军事援助”计划，美国还将提供当前印尼武装部队急需的其它装备，其中包括一百二十辆卡车。
