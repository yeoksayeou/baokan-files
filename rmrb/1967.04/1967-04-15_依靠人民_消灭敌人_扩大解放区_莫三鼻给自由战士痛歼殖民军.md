Rely on the People to Destroy the Enemy and Expand the Liberated Areas
Mozambique Freedom Fighters Decisively Defeat Colonial Troops

Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam: According to a communiqué issued by the Mozambique freedom fighters, from February 9 to 24, the freedom fighters in the Niassa Province killed 51 Portuguese colonial troops and wounded many more.

The communiqué stated that this year, the freedom fighters will intensify their attacks and ambushes on the Portuguese colonial forces, and expand the liberated areas. The communiqué said that the activities of the guerrilla forces have extended as far south as Mecanhelas in the Niassa Province.

The communiqué said, "The enemy has suffered continuous defeats, and morale is low. Because the enemy is unfamiliar with the terrain, does not know the jungle, and is surrounded by the people, the people report every action taken by the enemy to the guerrilla forces."

Xinhua News Agency, Algiers: According to a communiqué issued by the Mozambique freedom fighters here recently, the Mozambique guerrilla fighters killed 220 Portuguese colonial troops and wounded about 100 from December 31 last year to January 24 this year.

The communiqué stated that among the killed colonial troops was a Portuguese colonel. This colonel was leading a convoy of 37 vehicles carrying Portuguese soldiers, escorted by four planes, to "sweep" the Niassa Province when he was killed by patriotic fighters.

    莫三鼻给自由战士痛歼殖民军
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　据莫三鼻给的自由战士发表公报说，从二月九日至二十四日的半个月内，莫三鼻给自由战士在尼亚萨省打死葡萄牙殖民军五十一名，打伤多名。
    公报说，自由战士今年将加强对葡萄牙殖民军队的袭击和伏击，扩大解放区。公报说，游击队的活动已扩大到远至尼亚萨省最南部的美肯赫拉斯。
    公报说，“敌人遭到了连续不断的失败，士气低落。由于敌人不了解地形、不熟悉丛林、陷入了人民的包围之中，人民向游击队报告敌人所采取的任何一个行动。”
