Swaziland Progressive Party Representative Hails the Establishment of the Chinese Preparatory Committee for the Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference

A resolute struggle must be waged against the sabotage activities of the Soviet revisionist renegades

Reaffirms support for holding the Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference and the Afro-Asian Writers Conference in Beijing

CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) — The representative of the Swaziland Progressive Party in Cairo, Nkosi, issued a statement here on March 30, hailing the recent establishment of the Chinese Preparatory Committee for the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference. The statement also reaffirmed the Swaziland Progressive Party's full support for holding the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year.

The statement pointed out that the Fifth Conference to be held in China will be a historic event. China is currently undergoing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong.

The statement said that the Soviet revisionists, fearing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the broad anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist united front of the world's people, manipulated the illegal Nicosia meeting to change the venue of the Fifth Conference. "This once again proves that they are the chief accomplices of the U.S. imperialist aggressors. Therefore, we must wage a more resolute struggle against modern revisionism."

The statement said, "The Fifth Conference to be held in Beijing this year will achieve great success. Representatives from many Asian and African countries will gain more experience and will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthening the fighting unity against imperialism led by the United States and revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique."

The statement said, "We look forward to this conference because there will be no more Soviet revisionist cancer in our midst. Traitors are scum in the revolutionary ranks, and they are more dangerous than open reactionaries. After expelling the chief traitor, the Soviet revisionists, from our ranks, our ranks will be purified, our unity will be strengthened, and our struggle will be more effective and steadfast."

CAIRO, March 29 (Xinhua) — The representative of the Swaziland Progressive Party in Cairo, Nkosi, issued a statement here on March 29, condemning the Soviet revisionists' staging of the fake "Third Afro-Asian Writers Conference" in Beirut. The statement supported holding the Third Afro-Asian Writers Conference in Beijing this year.

The statement said, "For a long time, Soviet modern revisionists have been trying every means to infiltrate the ranks of the Asian and African peoples. They have supported some groups and used these groups to weaken the revolutionary forces of the oppressed masses. They have been constantly hatching vicious plots to split the liberation movements and other progressive organizations in Asia and Africa. They have been doing everything possible to sabotage and disrupt."

The statement said, "Swaziland writers will be more vigilant and strengthen their unity with writers from Asia and Africa to better prepare for the Third Afro-Asian Writers Conference to be held in China this year."

The statement emphasized that any "ship" sailing under the command of the reactionaries will eventually sink, while our "ship" will sail through the waves to final victory.

The statement concluded, "The permanent bureau of the Afro-Asian Writers Conference based in Colombo will overcome all difficulties until all imperialists, modern revisionists, and their running dogs are completely defeated and eliminated from the world, until all oppressed peoples of the world obtain freedom and liberation."

    斯威士兰进步党代表欢呼亚非团结大会中国筹委会成立
    必须同苏修叛徒的破坏行为作坚决斗争
    重申支持在北京召开亚非团结大会和亚非作家大会
    新华社开罗三十日电  斯威士兰进步党驻开罗代表恩科西三十日在这里发表声明，欢呼第五届亚非人民团结大会中国筹备委员会最近成立，并且重申斯威士兰进步党完全支持今年在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结大会。
    声明指出，将在中国举行的第五届大会将是具有历史意义的一次大会。中国正在伟大领袖毛泽东主席的直接领导下进行无产阶级文化大革命。
    声明说，苏联修正主义者由于害怕无产阶级文化大革命和世界人民广泛的反帝反修统一战线，操纵非法的尼科西亚会议改变第五届大会会址。“这又一次证明，他们是美帝国主义侵略者的头号帮凶。因此，必须更坚决地同现代修正主义作斗争。”
    声明说，“今年将在北京召开的第五届大会将取得巨大成就，来自许多亚非国家的所有代表将获得更多经验，并将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，加强反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修统治集团为首的修正主义的战斗团结。”
    声明说：“我们期待着这次大会，因为在我们中间将不会再有苏修这个毒瘤了。叛徒是革命队伍中的败类，他们比赤裸裸的反动派更加危险。把头号叛徒苏修从我们的组织中清除出去以后，我们的队伍将变得纯洁，我们的团结将更为巩固，我们的斗争必将更加有效和坚强。”
    新华社开罗二十九日电　斯威士兰进步党驻开罗代表恩科西二十九日在这里发表声明，谴责苏联修正主义者在贝鲁特上演伪“第三届亚非作家大会”丑剧。声明支持将于今年在北京召开的第三届亚非作家大会。
    声明说：“长期以来，苏联现代修正主义者一直在想方设法钻进亚非人民队伍中去，他们扶植了一些集团，并利用这些集团来削弱被压迫群众的革命力量。他们不断施展恶毒阴谋，企图分裂亚非的解放运动和其他进步组织。他们一直在千方百计地进行破坏和捣乱。”声明说：“斯威士兰作家将更加提高警惕，加强同亚非作家们的团结，为今年在中国举行的第三届亚非作家大会作更好的准备。”
    声明强调说，凡是在反动派指挥下航行的“船只”，终归是要沉没的，而我们的“船”将乘风破浪前进，直到取得最后胜利。
    声明最后说：“总部设在科伦坡的亚非作家常设局将克服一切困难，直到一切帝国主义者、现代修正主义者及其走狗被完全打败、从世界上被消灭干净，直到全世界被压迫人民得到自由和解放。”
