The editorial article in the fifth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine and Comrade Chen Boda's article "Is It Patriotism or Treason?" are excellent! These two articles greatly boost the morale of the proletarian revolutionary forces and strike a heavy blow to the capitalists who have been arrogantly attempting to restore capitalism and the top capitalist-roader in the Party. They also deliver a powerful counterattack to all the ghosts and monsters who have been trying to reverse the verdicts!

In the tumultuous days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, guided by the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, we have grown in the midst of class struggle and the stormy waves of mass movements. Many things we did not understand before, we now understand!

We have seen through the filthy soul of the top capitalist-roader in the Party.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party is China's Khrushchev. His book *On the Cultivation of the Self* is a product of capitalist restoration, a poisonous opium aimed at attacking the proletarian revolutionaries and corrupting the Chinese people.

The top capitalist-roader in China is the sworn enemy of all workers in China, the sworn enemy of all peasants, and also the sworn enemy of the revolutionary students. He is the biggest drug dealer in China. To ensure that our country will never change color, we must expose him and thoroughly criticize and eliminate the poison of his book, which is the theoretical basis for capitalist restoration. The revolutionary masses are wielding the mighty club of Mao Zedong Thought, striking at the root of Chinese revisionism, united as one, with a common hatred for the enemy. The situation is excellent!

In the face of the immense power of the great Mao Zedong Thought, China's Khrushchev seems a bit "smarter" than the Soviet Khrushchev, but he is also more sinister and more vicious. He has cloaked bourgeois individualism, idealism, and the rotten bourgeois philosophy of life in Marxist-Leninist garb, wrapping poison in revolutionary gold paper to peddle as a panacea in the market. In reality, his book *On the Cultivation of the Self* is a genuine revisionist "guide to self-cultivation." The more you "cultivate," the more you "revise." Following his book to "cultivate" oneself can only produce a bunch of people who, while outwardly respectable and polite, are filled with "legitimate" individualism and petty bourgeois mentality.

In that stinking book *On the Cultivation of the Self*, the top capitalist-roader in China tries every means to suppress the fearless revolutionary spirit of Communist Party members in the great struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, in the struggle between the two roads. Isn't that the case? In the great cultural revolution, this top capitalist-roader in the Party is terrified of the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought. He formulated the bourgeois reactionary line, created a white terror, and labeled countless revolutionary fighters as "counter-revolutionaries" and "rightists." We will never forget those days! It was the great Chairman Mao who initiated and led the mass attack on this bourgeois reactionary line, finally liberating the proletarian revolutionaries and defending Marxism-Leninism.

Chairman Mao admonishes us: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters must be criticized. We must not let them spread freely." We, the revolutionary fighters in middle schools, must pay great attention to this great debate and struggle that concerns the fate of the Party and the future of the country. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow *On the Cultivation of the Self* politically, theoretically, and ideologically!

The spring thunder rolls, and a new battle has begun. The articles published in the *Red Flag* magazine are another call to arms for the proletarian revolutionaries. Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, let us raise high the banner of criticism and revolution, and march forward bravely!

We are full of confidence in winning new victories!

    高举革命的批判大旗前进！
    首都中等学校红代会负责人  李冬民
    《红旗》杂志第五期评论员文章和戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》文章好得很！这两篇文章大长无产阶级革命派的志气，给进行资本主义复辟嚣张一时的、党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派当头一棒，也给一切大刮翻案风的牛鬼蛇神以最有力的回击！
    在无产阶级文化大革命的惊涛骇浪的日子里，由于有光焰无际的毛泽东思想指导着我们进行斗争，使我们在阶级斗争的硝烟中，在群众运动的大风大浪中成长起来了；许多原来不懂的道理，我们现在懂得了！
    我们看清了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的肮脏的灵魂。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。他的《修养》一书，就是资本主义复辟的黑货，是向无产阶级革命派进攻的、毒害中国人民的最毒的鸦片烟。　
    中国头号走资本主义道路的当权派，是全中国工人的仇敌，农民的仇敌，同样也是中学革命派不共戴天的仇敌。他是中国最大的毒贩子。要想保证我国千秋万代不变色，就必须把他揪出来，把他那本传播修正主义、作为资本主义复辟的理论基础的《修养》，彻底批臭，彻底消除它的流毒。广大革命群众正奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，直捣中国修正主义的总根子，万众一心，同仇敌忾，形势好极了！
    在伟大的毛泽东思想光芒的无比巨大的威力面前，中国的赫鲁晓夫似乎比苏联的赫鲁晓夫来得“聪明”一些，但也更加阴险，更加恶毒一些。他把资产阶级的个人主义、唯心主义，腐烂透顶的资产阶级处世哲学披上了马列主义的外衣，把毒品包上一层革命的金纸，拿到市场上冒充灵丹妙药去兜售，实际上他的那本《修养》，是货真价实的修正主义的“养身之道”，修养修养，真是越“养”越“修”。按照他的书去进行“修养”，只能是培养出一班表面道貌岸然，彬彬有礼，而骨子里塞满了“合法”的个人主义的市侩。
    这个中国头号走资本主义道路的当权派，在那本臭气熏天的《修养》里，还千方百计地扼杀共产党员在无产阶级同资产阶级的大搏斗中，在两条道路的大是大非的斗争中的大无畏造反精神。事实不正是这样吗？在伟大的文化大革命的群众运动中，这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派对用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众怕得要死，他制订了资产阶级的反动路线，制造白色恐怖，把多少革命闯将，打成“反革命”、“右派分子”。我们永远忘不了那些日子！是伟大的毛主席发动和领导了对这条资产阶级反动路线的群众性的总攻击，终于解放了无产阶级革命派，捍卫了马克思列宁主义。
    毛主席告诫我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”我们中学的革命战士，一定要十分注意这种关系到党的命运、国家前途的大争论，大斗争；要以毛泽东思想为武器，把《修养》这本毒书从政治上、理论上、思想上批深、批透、批倒、批臭！
    春雷滚滚，新的战役打响了。《红旗》杂志发表的文章，就是无产阶级革命派进军的又一个新的号角。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，让我们高举批判的大旗、革命的大旗，奋勇前进！
    我们充满了获得新胜利的信心！
