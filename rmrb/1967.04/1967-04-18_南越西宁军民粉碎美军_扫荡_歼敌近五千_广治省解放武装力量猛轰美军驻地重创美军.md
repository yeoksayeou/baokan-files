The military and civilians of South Vietnam's Ninh Thuan Province bravely foiled a major "sweep" operation launched by U.S. aggressor forces in the northeastern part of the province from March 18 to April 10. They annihilated nearly 4,800 enemy troops, the vast majority of whom were U.S. aggressor forces. Among the enemy forces annihilated were two entire infantry battalions, four infantry companies, one artillery battalion, and seven armored battalions.

The liberation forces also destroyed 32 enemy cannons, 261 tanks and armored vehicles, and 34 other military vehicles, and shot down 51 enemy aircraft.

In this operation, the enemy deployed three brigades from the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and the 196th Light Infantry Brigade, totaling five brigades. The enemy adopted a so-called "steady advance" tactic. They used trucks and helicopters to transport large numbers of U.S. troops to Tong Nhut, Soc Trang, and Tong Ban, forming a large encirclement, surrounding an area of approximately 450 square kilometers in the northeastern part of Ninh Thuan Province. They attempted to launch attacks from Tong Nhut and other "sweep" bases, gradually destroying the liberated areas.

However, contrary to the enemy's wishes, as soon as their troops arrived, they were immediately met with fierce resistance. Local forces and guerrilla units engaged the enemy on all fronts, creating favorable conditions for the main forces of the liberation army to launch large-scale battles in Tong Nhut, Thua Thien, and Dak Se.

On March 21, the liberation army launched a fierce attack in the Tong Nhut area, annihilating an entire U.S. infantry battalion and three armored battalions, severely damaging one infantry battalion, and killing 1,200 enemy troops. They also shot down 10 enemy aircraft and destroyed 14 cannons, rendering a U.S. brigade completely ineffective and forcing it to withdraw from the battlefield. On March 28, the liberation army ambushed a group of U.S. troops advancing from the south in the Dak Se area, killing 200 and destroying 23 tanks and armored vehicles. On March 31, they ambushed a U.S. battalion in the Thua Thien area, annihilating two companies. On the morning of April 1, they annihilated a U.S. infantry battalion sent for reinforcements and shot down 12 enemy aircraft.

Under the continuous heavy blows from the military and civilians of Ninh Thuan Province, the U.S. aggressor forces were in a state of panic. Starting from April 1, they were forced to retreat from Tong Nhut and Thua Thien. By April 10, all invading enemy troops had been driven out of the northeastern part of Ninh Thuan Province.

Thus, since February 22, the heroic military and civilians of Ninh Thuan Province, after more than a month of fierce fighting in four anti-"sweep" battles, annihilated more than 12,000 U.S. aggressor troops and a large number of puppet and mercenary troops. They destroyed 750 tanks and armored vehicles, more than 150 other military vehicles, nearly 100 heavy cannons, and shot down nearly 170 enemy aircraft.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation Communication Agency, after recently inflicting a series of blows on the enemy, the liberation forces in Quang Tri Province launched a heavy artillery attack on the U.S. base and artillery positions on Hill 241 from the night of April 6 to the early morning of April 7. They killed and wounded nearly 1,500 U.S. aggressor troops, destroying 5 tanks and 20 heavy cannons.

This artillery attack by the liberation forces was a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors' attempt to "defend" the western line of Highway 9, causing the U.S. aggressor troops stationed in Dak Rang, New Linh, and Cam Lu to be in a state of panic. In addition, the liberation forces also attacked the U.S. artillery positions in Yu Ling County at the same time, killing more than 200 U.S. aggressor troops and destroying multiple 175mm cannons.

    南越西宁军民粉碎美军“扫荡”歼敌近五千
    广治省解放武装力量猛轰美军驻地重创美军
    据新华社河内十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道，越南南方西宁省军民，三月十八日到四月十日，英勇粉碎了美国侵略军对西宁省东北部解放区发动的大“扫荡”，共歼灭敌人四千八百多名，其中绝大部分是美国侵略军。在被消灭的敌军中，包括全歼两个步兵营、四个步兵连、一个炮兵营和七个装甲营。
    解放武装力量还击毁敌人的大炮三十二门，击毁坦克、装甲车二百六十一辆和其他军车三十四辆，击落敌机五十一架。
    这次，敌人出动了美国第一步兵师和第二十五步兵师的三个旅、第一七三空降旅和一九六轻步兵旅，共五个旅的兵力。敌人采用了所谓“稳扎稳打”的新战术。他们先后用军车和直升飞机把大批美军运到同若、朔昆曾、同班等地，形成一个大包围圈，把西宁省东北部大约四百五十平方公里的地区包围起来。他们企图从同若等上述各个“扫荡”基地出发，分路进攻和逐步地摧毁解放区。
    但是，同敌人的愿望完全相反，他们的军队刚刚到达，就立即遭到迎头痛击。地方部队和游击队咬住各路敌人，为解放军主力部队在同若、帅握、达谢等地进行大规模战斗创造了有利条件。
    三月二十一日，解放军在同若地区发起猛烈进攻，全歼美军一个步兵营和三个装甲营，重创一个步兵营，共消灭敌人一千二百名，击落敌机十架，击毁大炮十四门，使美国侵略军的一个旅完全丧失战斗力，不得不撤出战场。三月二十八日，解放军在达谢地区截击一股从南面开来的美军，消灭其中二百名，击毁坦克和装甲车二十三辆。接着，三十一日在帅握地区截击一营美军，全歼两个连。四月一日清晨，又全歼赶去增援的一个美军步兵营，并击落敌机十二架。
    在西宁军民接二连三的沉重打击下，美国侵略军惊恐万状。从四月一日起，被迫先后从同若、帅握等地撤退。到十日为止，入侵的敌军已全部被赶出西宁省东北部地区。
    这样，从二月二十二日以来，英雄的西宁省军民经过一个多月的英勇奋战，在四次反“扫荡”战斗中，共消灭美国侵略军一万二千多名和大批伪军、帮凶军，击毁坦克和装甲车七百五十辆、其他军车一百五十多辆和重型大炮近一百门，击落敌机近一百七十架。
    据新华社河内十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广治省解放武装力量继最近给予敌人一系列的打击后，四月六日深夜到七日凌晨又猛烈炮击第二四一号高地的美军驻地和炮兵阵地，打死打伤美国侵略军近一千五百名，击毁坦克五辆和重型大炮二十门。
    解放武装力量的这次炮击，是对美国强盗企图“保卫”第九号公路西面防线的阴谋一次沉重打击，使得盘踞在达根、新林和甘露等地的美国侵略军惊慌万状，惶惶不可终日。此外，解放武装力量还在同一时间内炮击了犹灵县美国炮兵阵地，打死美国侵略军二百多名，击毁175毫米口径大炮多门。
