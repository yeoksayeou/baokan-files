Hongjing Brigade in the Cultural Revolution Firmly Puts Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works in the First Place

The Hongjing Brigade of Shaoxi People's Commune in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, is a well-known advanced unit for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. During the surging and roaring Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of this brigade have firmly put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the first place. They resolutely carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely criticize the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the top capitalist-roader in the Party, grasp revolution and promote production, and have achieved a new situation of victory in both revolution and production.

Grasping the Main Direction of the Struggle

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing Brigade, who have an infinite love for Mao Zedong Thought, deeply realize during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that this revolution aims to resolve the contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and between socialism and capitalism. In the movement, they follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly grasp the main direction of the struggle, and concentrate their forces to strike at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. They regard the attitude towards the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought as the dividing line between enemies and comrades. They support those who uphold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and oppose those who oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

After the editorial article "On the Bourgeois Reactionary Line in the Personnel Issue" and Comrade Chen Boda's article "Patriotism or Treachery?" were published in the Red Flag magazine, exposing the heinous crimes of the top capitalist-roader in the Party who brazenly opposes the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Hongjing Brigade immediately held denunciation meetings and various discussion sessions. They used ironclad facts to refute the shameless lies of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, and eliminated its poisonous influence. Activist in studying Chairman Mao's works, Gu Atiao, indignantly denounced: "The top capitalist-roader in the Party hates socialism and loves capitalism, dreaming of dragging us poor and lower-middle peasants and laboring people back into the capitalist hell. We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely stand on Chairman Mao's side, uphold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and fight to overthrow, smash, and expose the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, uprooting the backstage manipulator of Chinese revisionism."

The struggle to defend Mao Zedong Thought in Hongjing Brigade runs through the entire Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, this brigade has implemented Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on infusing Mao Zedong Thought into the peasants, becoming a red flag for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and has received enthusiastic praise from the revolutionary masses. However, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the prefectural and county Party committees, along with some untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, regard this brigade as a thorn in their side and a bone in their throat, using every means to suppress and denigrate it, attempting to topple this red flag. They maliciously claimed that "studying Chairman Mao's works cannot solve the problem of high yields of grain and cotton," fiercely opposing Comrade Lin Biao's great call to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. As soon as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Hongjing Brigade, with deep hatred for a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, used the weapons of big debates, big-character posters, big meetings, and big struggles to fully expose them, trace their roots, and relentlessly pursue and strike them, finally pulling out the counter-revolutionary revisionists who had usurped the leading positions in the county Party committee; they also concentrated their firepower to continuously expose and struggle against a few landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in their own brigade who were in cahoots with the counter-revolutionary revisionists, and implemented strict supervision and control over them.

Distinguishing Between the Two Types of Contradictions and Correctly Handling Cadres

The revolutionary masses of Hongjing Brigade have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's cadre policy, resolutely resisted the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a few" in cadre issues. Through mass debates, big-character posters, and big meetings, they fully exposed and criticized the cadres of the brigade on the basis of basic estimates. They believed that the socialist education movement in Hongjing Brigade was carried out more thoroughly, the lid of class struggle was lifted more deeply, and the roots of Mao Zedong Thought were planted more firmly. The vast majority of cadres in the brigade support the Party, support Chairman Mao, and insist on the socialist road. Their different degrees of shortcomings and errors are internal contradictions among the people. Therefore, they followed Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the person," giving serious criticism to cadres who made mistakes, patient help, and warm encouragement to help them put down their mental burdens, lighten their loads, and actively grasp revolution and promote production.

The revolutionary masses of Hongjing Brigade criticized the brigade Party secretary, Yang Mingsheng, quite sharply. At first, Yang Mingsheng was a bit confused, mistakenly thinking that being a cadre was "disadvantageous," "being criticized," and "like carrying a stone millstone to perform, with no reward for effort." Therefore, he relaxed his work and was not forceful enough in struggling against counter-revolutionary revisionists. The responsible persons of the revolutionary organization of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the brigade, such as Wen Zhongying, Shen Xuelin, and Huang Lijuan, pointed out his active thoughts, studied Chairman Mao's teachings with him: "You must put politics in command, go to the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." Everyone helped him correctly handle the masses' criticism, encouraged him to stand tall, and boldly lead the work. Chairman Mao's warm instructions and the masses' enthusiastic help made Yang Mingsheng's mind clear. He realized that cadres lose only their shortcomings and errors in the Cultural Revolution, but gain personal integrity and national stability. He struggled against his selfishness, sincerely examined his mistakes, stood with the revolutionary masses, and resolutely struggled against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, gaining the understanding and support of the masses.

Overthrowing Selfishness and Repelling the Black Wind of Economism

Just as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was at the critical moment of the struggle between the two lines, the black wind of counter-revolutionary economism blown by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party also reached Hongjing Brigade. During the year-end distribution last year, a few people took the opportunity of big debates and big-character posters to advocate leaving less accumulation. The brigade Party branch and the revolutionary organization of the poor and lower-middle peasants adopted the method of "first communicating thoughts and then distributing money and grain," organizing cadres and masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's quotations on "in the distribution issue, we must consider the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual" and the Party's distribution policy. They used Chairman Mao's teachings on considering the overall situation to criticize the selfish thoughts of a few people who only cared about their own interests and not the state's, and repelled this black wind of economism. On this basis, Hongjing Brigade insisted on democratic distribution, correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. The collective grain reserve increased twofold compared to the previous year, the collective cash accumulation maintained the level of the previous year, and the collective economy continued to grow. The brigade added three hand-held tractors and built two new bridges, creating good conditions for expanding production.

At the beginning of this year, some people with ulterior motives tried to lure some former factory workers in Hongjing Brigade to "rebel" in the factories. At that time, a few people were temporarily deceived, but when they thought of Chairman Mao's teachings of "selflessly serving the people" and Chairman Mao's great call of "grasp revolution and promote production," they immediately realized that this was "rebelling for money," taking the wrong path. They realized that this was a plot by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to incite opposition between workers and peasants, disrupt the worker-peasant alliance, disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and disrupt agricultural production. In less than a week, this black wind was suppressed by the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing using the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought.

Grasping Revolution and Promoting Production, Launching a New Production High Tide

The revolutionary cadres and masses of Hongjing Brigade resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution and promote production." They first correct the relationship between revolution and production in their minds, putting revolution in the first place and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the first place, insisting on the correct political direction, mobilizing all positive factors, and promoting production development. During the busy spring plowing season, a few cadres mistakenly thought that the current task was mainly to grasp spring plowing production, and cultural revolution could be put aside; during the busy season, production was important, and studying Chairman Mao's works could be relaxed. This thought trend was immediately criticized as soon as it appeared. Revolutionary cadres and masses studied the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Countryside (Draft)" and the "Letter of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in the Countryside Across the Country," unanimously believing that politics is the soul, revolution is the motive force, and at any time, revolution must be put in the first place; only grasping production and forgetting revolution will lose direction; studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the lifeline of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and it cannot be relaxed for a moment, the busier it is, the more it should be studied. At the same time, there was another thought trend, that is, only grasping revolution and neglecting production. In response to this tendency, the revolutionary masses of Hongjing studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "At present, it is the spring plowing season, and I hope that all leading comrades, cadres, and masses in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the production links and achieve greater results than last year." They realized that doing a good job in this year's spring plowing production is related to "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," related to the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and is part of the entire struggle. They decided to be both revolutionary pioneers and production models. In handling the relationship between revolution and production, they put revolution in the first place; in time arrangement, they had more time for production, working hard on production during the day and making a big fuss about revolution at night. This is how they grasp revolution, promote production, and launch a new high tide of revolution and production.

Through this great class struggle to defend Mao Zedong Thought, the cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing Brigade further ignited their infinite love, faith, and worship for Mao Zedong Thought. They are determined to turn Hongjing into a big school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly in Hongjing.

    洪泾大队在文化大革命中坚持把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位
    用毛泽东思想指导阶级斗争和生产斗争
    集中火力打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派；坚决执行毛主席的干部政策；打退反革命经济主义黑风；狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得革命生产双胜利。
    本报讯　江苏太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队是著名的活学活用毛主席著作的先进单位。这个大队的贫下中农和革命干部，在汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命中，坚持把活学活用毛主席著作放在首要地位。他们坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线，狠抓革命，猛促生产，出现了革命和生产双胜利的崭新局面。
    紧紧掌握斗争大方向
    无限热爱毛泽东思想的洪泾大队的贫下中农，在无产阶级文化大革命中，深深认识到这场革命所要解决的，是无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义同资本主义两条道路的矛盾。他们在运动中遵循毛主席的教导，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他们把对伟大的领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想的态度，作为区别是敌人还是同志的分水岭。谁高举毛泽东思想红旗就拥护谁，谁反对毛泽东思想就打倒谁。
    《红旗》杂志发表的评论员文章《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》和戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》，揭露了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派猖狂地反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行以后，洪泾大队广大贫下中农和革命干部立即举行了声讨大会和各种座谈会，用铁的事实，驳斥党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的无耻谰言，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的流毒。学习毛主席著作积极分子顾阿桃以愤怒的心情控诉说：“党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，恨的是社会主义，爱的是资本主义，梦想把我们贫下中农和劳动人民拖回到资本主义的火坑里去。我们贫下中农坚决站在毛主席一边，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，挖掉中国修正主义的总后台。”大队民兵副营长闻忠英说：“毛主席教导我们：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派提倡‘四大自由’、‘三自一包’，就是要我们贫下中农走回头路、吃二遍苦，就是要把旧社会的三把刀——租重、税多、利钱高，再砍到我们身上，把旧社会穷人的三条路——挨饿、上吊、坐监牢，再摆到我们面前，就是要把‘三座大山’再压到我们头上。我们一万个不答应。”
    洪泾大队捍卫毛泽东思想的斗争，贯串在整个无产阶级文化大革命运动过程中。这个大队在解放军的帮助下，贯彻执行了林彪同志关于把毛泽东思想灌输到农民中去的指示，成为一面活学活用毛主席著作的红旗，得到了广大革命群众的热烈赞扬。然而，地委和县委内的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，和一些没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，却把这个大队视为眼中钉、肉中刺，千方百计地压制它、贬低它，妄想把这面红旗打倒。他们胡说什么“读毛主席的书并不能解决粮棉高产的问题”，极力对抗林彪同志关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的伟大号召。无产阶级文化大革命一开始，洪泾大队的贫下中农和革命干部，就满怀着对一小撮反革命修正主义分子的深仇大恨，用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的武器，进行了充分的揭露，寻根究源，穷追猛打，终于把窃踞在县委领导岗位上的反革命修正主义分子揪了出来；对本大队的几个与反革命修正主义分子一鼻孔出气的地、富、反、坏、右分子，也集中火力进行了连续的揭露和斗争，并对他们实行了严格的监督和管制。
    区分两类矛盾　正确对待干部
    洪泾大队的革命群众反复学习了毛主席的干部政策，坚决抵制了在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。经过群众性的大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，在充分揭发和批判的基础上，贫下中农革命派对大队的干部队伍作了基本的估计。他们认为：洪泾大队的社会主义教育运动搞得比较彻底，阶级斗争的盖子揭得比较深透，毛泽东思想的根子扎得比较牢固。大队的绝大多数干部是拥护党、拥护毛主席、坚持走社会主义道路的。他们存在的不同程度的缺点和错误，是人民内部矛盾。因此，他们遵循毛主席制定的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，对于犯有错误的干部，给予严肃的批判，耐心的帮助，热情地鼓励他们放下思想包袱，轻装上阵，积极地抓革命，促生产。
    洪泾大队的革命群众对党支部书记杨明生的批评比较尖锐。杨明生开始有点想不通，错误地认为当干部“吃亏”、“挨整”、“顶了石臼做戏，吃力不讨好”，因而对工作有点放松，对反革命修正主义分子的斗争也不够有力。大队贫下中农革命组织的负责人闻忠英、沈雪林、黄丽娟等，针对他的活思想，和他一起学习毛主席的教导：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”大家帮助他正确地对待群众的批评，鼓励他挺起腰杆，大胆领导工作。毛主席的亲切教导，群众的热情帮助，使杨明生的思想豁然开朗。他认识到：干部在文化大革命中失去的只是缺点和错误，得到的却是个人不变质，国家不变色。他狠斗私心，诚恳地检查了自己的错误，和革命群众站在一起，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开坚决斗争，得到了群众的谅解和支持。
    打倒私字　击退经济主义黑风
    正当无产阶级文化大革命进行到两条路线斗争的关键时刻，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派刮起的反革命经济主义的黑风，也吹到了洪泾大队。在去年年终分配时，有极少数人借大鸣大放的机会，主张少留积累。大队党支部和贫下中农革命派采取了“先通思想，后分钱粮”的办法，组织干部和群众认真学习了毛主席的语录“在分配问题上，我们必须兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益”和党的分配政策，用毛主席有关顾全大局的教导，批判了少数人只顾小家、不顾国家的私心杂念，打退了这股经济主义黑风。在这个基础上，洪泾大队坚持民主分配，正确处理国家、集体、个人三者之间的关系。集体储备粮比前年增加二倍，集体现金积累保持去年的水平，集体经济不断壮大。大队增添了三台手扶拖拉机，新建了二座桥，为扩大再生产创造了良好条件。
    今年年初，又有一些别有用心的人，在洪泾大队拉拢一些曾在工厂做过工的农民去工厂“造反”。当时少数人一时受了蒙蔽，但是当他们一想到毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，一想到毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，立即认识到这是在“为钞票造反”，走错了路。他们认识到这是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在阴谋挑起工人与农民之间的对立，破坏工农联盟，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏农业生产。不到一个星期，这股黑风，就被洪泾贫下中农用毛泽东思想的锐利武器平息了下去。抓革命促生产，掀起生产新高潮
    洪泾大队的革命干部和革命群众，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。他们首先从思想上摆正革命和生产的关系，把革命放在首要地位，把活学活用毛主席著作放在首要地位，坚持正确的政治方向，调动一切积极因素，推动生产的发展。春耕大忙期间，有少数干部错误地认为：当前主要抓春耕生产，文化革命可以放一放；大忙季节生产要紧，学习毛主席著作可以松一松。这种思想苗头刚出现就立即遭到批判。革命干部和革命群众学习了《中共中央关于农村无产阶级文化大革命的指示（草案）》和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，一致认为：政治是灵魂，革命是动力，任何时候都要把革命放在第一位；只抓生产，忘记革命，就会迷失方向；活学活用毛主席著作是贫下中农的命根子，一时一刻都不能放松，越忙就越要学习毛主席著作。与此同时，也有另一种思想苗头。那就是，只抓革命，忽视生产。针对这种倾向，洪泾的革命群众学习了毛主席语录：“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”他们认识到搞好今年春耕生产，关系到“备战、备荒、为人民”，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，是整个斗争的一部分。他们决心既做革命的闯将，又做生产的模范。他们在处理革命与生产的关系上，把革命放在第一位；在时间安排上，生产的时间多一些，白天狠抓生产，晚上大闹革命。他们就是这样狠抓革命，猛促生产，掀起了革命和生产新高潮。
    洪泾大队的干部和贫下中农通过这场捍卫毛泽东思想的阶级大搏斗，进一步激发了对毛泽东思想的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的阶级感情。他们决心把洪泾办成活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在洪泾永远飘扬。		本报通讯员　本报记者
