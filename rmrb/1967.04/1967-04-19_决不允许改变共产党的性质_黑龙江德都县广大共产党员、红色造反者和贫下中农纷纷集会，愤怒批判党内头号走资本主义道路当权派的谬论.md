Communist Party members, Red Guards, and poor and lower-middle peasants in Dehua County, Heilongjiang, hold meetings to angrily criticize the fallacies of the top capitalist-roader within the Party

According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, April 18th — Communist Party members, Red Guards, and poor and lower-middle peasants in Dehua County, Heihe Region, Heilongjiang, have recently held criticism meetings to angrily denounce the top capitalist-roader within the Party's shameless propaganda of "Even if there are ten thousand rich peasants in the Northeast, we are not afraid." They sternly point out: The top capitalist-roader within the Party attempts to turn the great Communist Party, personally founded by our great leader Chairman Mao, into a "rich peasant party." This is a pipe dream and a wild fantasy!

Not a single rich peasant party member should be allowed to exist

Wei Enming, a member of the Qingshan People's Commune Revolutionary Committee and the party branch secretary of the 53rd Production Brigade, angrily said: The top capitalist-roader within the Party blatantly shouts, "Even if there are ten thousand rich peasants in the Northeast, we are not afraid," in order to restore capitalism and develop a "three horses, one plow, and one cart" rich peasant economy. Just look at the struggle between the two roads in our 53rd Brigade during the period of cooperativization, and you will know how sinister the intentions of the top capitalist-roader within the Party are.

In 1953, the poor and lower-middle peasants in our village actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to take the road of agricultural cooperativization and organized an initial-level agricultural cooperative with fourteen households. However, the brigade leader at that time was a party member with serious rich peasant thoughts, who was determined to pursue personal wealth. The cooperative did not do well in its first year, and before the year-end settlement, he spread rumors saying, "The cooperative is no good!" "Don't do it!" At the year-end settlement meeting, he jumped out again, leading the call to withdraw from the cooperative. Party member Hua Fangdian and three other poor and lower-middle peasants stood firm against this wrong trend and resolutely refused to withdraw. They said, "Taking the road of cooperativization is what Chairman Mao proposed, and this is the road we will take!" Inspired by them, the four households that were originally going to withdraw also stayed. The poor and lower-middle peasants elected Hua Fangdian as the brigade leader and continued to run the cooperative. Old party member Wang Jiahe also joined the cooperative. With eight households united, the cooperative achieved a bumper harvest in the second year, far surpassing individual households. The seven households that withdrew from the cooperative, however, had to sell their cattle, and some even had to borrow grain to eat. Seeing the superiority of the collective economy, the poor and lower-middle peasants applied to join the cooperative in the autumn, and the small cooperative with eight households developed into a large cooperative with more than forty households. That brigade leader, who was full of rich peasant thoughts, refused to take the road of cooperativization pointed out by Chairman Mao and was incorrigible, and was eventually expelled from the party.

Chen Shouzhi, a party member of the Qingshan Brigade, Chengjiao People's Commune, said: Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China." "The people rely on us to organize." If we follow the top capitalist-roader within the Party, party members are "rich peasant party members," how can we organize the masses to take the socialist road? How can we fight against the capitalist forces in the countryside? The small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in the countryside are the "rich peasant party members" praised by the Khrushchev of China. We must resolutely overthrow such "party members," and not allow a single one to exist!

Forever maintain the red flag of our great party

Ma Yunshan, an old poor peasant livestock breeder from the Hemin Brigade, Xinfa People's Commune, said: The top capitalist-roader within the Party attempts to change the nature of our party, which is a wild fantasy! He also said, "Even with exploitation, one can be a socialist," and I almost burst with anger when I heard these lies. Chairman Mao teaches us that Communist Party members are public servants of the people, and the Communist Party aims to eliminate exploitation and lead the people towards communism. The top capitalist-roader within the Party dares to oppose our great leader Chairman Mao. Exploitation is exploitation, how can one still be a Communist Party member?

Wang Ying, a staff member of the county revolutionary committee, said: Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "The proletariat must transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved." The Khrushchev of China stubbornly stands on the reactionary stance of the bourgeoisie, attempting to turn our great proletarian party into a bourgeois party and change the nature of our party. Let me tell you, this is a pipe dream! We poor and lower-middle peasants will resolutely overthrow and expose your counter-revolutionary theories. We will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and forever maintain the revolutionary red flag of our party.

Firmly follow Chairman Mao on the broad road to socialism

Ma Wenzheng, a party member of the Xinli Brigade, Heping People's Commune, said: Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we have taken the broad road of cooperativization and communalization, and the collective economy has been continuously developed, and the lives of commune members have been continuously improved. However, in 1961, a capitalist-roader within the county committee came to our brigade for a "pilot project," proposing to distribute large livestock to households for breeding, bonuses for offspring, no communal rations, and distributing "ration land" to commune members, etc. We poor and lower-middle peasants were immediately alarmed and said: Isn't this dismantling the collective? Won't this lead to polarization again? We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that people's communes are good, and we resolutely pushed back the capitalist-roader within the county committee. Now we know that the wrong wind blown by the capitalist-roader within the county committee originally had roots, and this root is the top capitalist-roader within the Party. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more the top capitalist-roader within the Party desperately opposes our taking the road of collectivization, the more we must take the road of collectivization. The broad road pointed out by Chairman Mao, we will forever walk on it, all the way to communism!

    决不允许改变共产党的性质
    黑龙江德都县广大共产党员、红色造反者和贫下中农纷纷集会，愤怒批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的谬论
    据新华社哈尔滨十八日电　黑龙江黑河地区德都县的共产党员、红色造反者和贫下中农，最近纷纷开批判会，愤怒批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派疯狂鼓吹“东北有一万个富农党员也不怕”的无耻谰言。他们严正指出：党内头号走资本主义道路当权派妄图把我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的伟大的共产党，变成“富农党”，这是白日作梦，痴心妄想！
    不能让一个富农党员存在
    青山公社革命委员会委员、五三大队党支部书记魏恩明愤怒地说：党内头号走资本主义道路当权派露骨地叫嚷“东北有一万个富农党员也不怕”，就是为了搞资本主义复辟，发展“三马一犁一车式的”富农经济。看一看我们五三大队在合作化期间两条道路的斗争，就知道党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的用心何其毒也。
    一九五三年，我们村里的贫下中农，积极响应毛主席走农业合作化道路的号召，组织起十四户的初级农业合作社。可是，当时的社主任是一个有严重富农思想的党员，他一心搞个人发家致富。合作社头一年没办好，还没到年终决算，他就到处煽风，说什么“合作社没个好！”“别干了！”在年终决算会上，他又跳出来，带头嚷嚷要退社。党员华方甸等三户贫下中农顶住了这股歪风，坚决不退社。他们说：“走合作化的道路是毛主席提出来的，这条路我们走定了！”在他们的带动下，本来要退社的四户也留了下来。贫下中农选举华方甸当社主任，继续把社办下去。老党员王家和也参加了合作社。八户一条心，第二年合作社就获得了大丰收，大大超过了单干户。那退社的七户，却有的卖了牛，有的还要借粮吃。广大贫下中农看到了集体经济的优越性，秋后纷纷申请入社，八户的小社发展成四十多户的大社。那个满脑子富农思想的社主任拒不走毛主席指出的合作化道路，屡教不改，最后被清除出党。
    城郊公社青山大队党员陈守志说：我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”“人民靠我们去组织”。要是依了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，党员是“富农党员”，怎么能组织群众走社会主义道路？怎么能同农村资本主义势力作斗争？农村中的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫夸奖的“富农党员”，这样的“党员”我们要坚决打倒，一个也不能让他存在！
    永远保持我们伟大的党的鲜红旗帜
    新发公社合民大队老贫农饲养员马云山说：党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，妄图改变我们党的性质，这是痴心妄想！他还说“有剥削还可以做社会主义者”，我一听到这些鬼话肺都要气炸了。毛主席教导我们，共产党员是为人民服务的人民勤务员，共产党是要消灭剥削，领导人民走向共产主义的。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，竟敢和我们的伟大领袖毛主席唱对台戏。有剥削就是剥削者，怎么还能当共产党员？
    县革命委员会工作人员王颖说：我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”中国的赫鲁晓夫就是顽固地站在资产阶级反动立场上，要把我们伟大的无产阶级政党，改变成资产阶级政党，妄想改变我们党的性质。告诉你，这是白日作梦！我们贫下中农要坚决把你的这些反革命理论彻底批倒批臭。我们要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远保持我们党的革命的鲜红的旗帜。
    坚决跟着毛主席走社会主义的康庄大道
    和平公社新立大队党员马文章说：在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，我们走上了合作化、人民公社化的康庄大道，集体经济不断发展，社员生活不断提高。可是，一九六一年县委里一个走资本主义道路的当权派到我们大队来“试点”，提出什么分大牲畜到户饲养，下崽儿提成，集体不分口粮，分给社员“口粮地”等等。我们贫下中农一听就急了，说：那不是拆集体的台吗？不又要出现两极分化吗？我们贫下中农牢记毛主席还是人民公社好的教导，把县里来的那个走资本主义道路当权派坚决顶了回去。现在我们才知道，县里走资本主义道路的当权派吹来的一股歪风，原来是有根子的，这个根子，就是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派越是这样丧心病狂地反对我们走集体化的道路，我们就越是要走集体化的道路。毛主席给我们指出的康庄大道，我们要永远走下去，一直走到共产主义！
