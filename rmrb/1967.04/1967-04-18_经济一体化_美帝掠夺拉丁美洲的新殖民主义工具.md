Title: "Economic Integration" - A New Tool of Neocolonialism for U.S. Imperialism to Plunder Latin America

The decision on "Latin American economic integration" adopted at the recently concluded "Conference of American States" is a plan by U.S. imperialism to further colonize the economies of Latin American countries. More than a decade ago, U.S. imperialism began to promote "Central American economic integration," intensifying its economic infiltration and plunder of Central American countries. These two "integrations" are essentially one and the same.

Breaking Down Tariff Barriers to Dump U.S. Goods

The first important step in "Central American economic integration" was to break down the weak tariff barriers of Central American countries, gradually allowing goods within the region to circulate freely without taxes, and unifying the tariffs on goods imported from outside the Central American region. Thus, U.S. goods, which dominate the imports of Central American countries, and products of U.S. monopolies that set up factories in Central American countries, obtained the convenience of unrestricted circulation in Central American countries. This led to the flooding of U.S. goods in Central America and the accelerated infiltration of U.S. monopoly capital, thereby dealing a more severe blow to the national economies of Central American countries.

Another step in "economic integration" was, under the pretext of "overcoming the limitations on development caused by insufficient fiscal and other resources," to establish a series of "governmental or non-governmental cooperation programs" in Central American countries, such as the "Central American Integration Bank" and the "Central American Bill Exchange," and so on.

Through Investment Loans to Extract Massive Profits

These institutions and measures also primarily created more favorable conditions for U.S. investment, factory establishment, and other economic infiltration and plunder activities. For example, the "Central American Integration Bank" had $100 million in funds in May 1966, of which $75 million was U.S. loans. The "Central American Industrial Research Institute," while nominally responsible for formulating the region's "development" plans, is actually an institution serving U.S. and other foreign capitalists.

It has been proven that since the implementation of "economic integration," U.S. capital has controlled more economic sectors in Central American countries, making the Central American economy even more colonialized. According to the "U.S. News and World Report," in 1965, new investments in new industries in this region totaled approximately $150 million, of which U.S. capital accounted for about half. Many large U.S. monopolies participated in the investment, including Standard Oil Company, Mobil Oil Company, and others.

It is revealed that for every dollar the U.S. invests in Central America, it can exploit three dollars. Meanwhile, the U.S. has become the largest creditor of Central America. According to the Guatemalan "Illustrated Magazine" on January 28 of this year, Guatemala's foreign debt has reached 318 million quetzals (equivalent to U.S. dollars). Costa Rica's foreign debt last year was 15 billion colones, and in the annual national budget of 6.5 billion colones, 1.5 billion colones were used to pay off the principal and interest of the foreign debt.

The Prelude to "Political Integration"

"Economic integration" is the prelude to the U.S. conspiracy to achieve "political integration" and "military integration" in Central American countries, further strengthening its political and military control over the region. While vigorously promoting "economic integration," in 1965, the U.S. State Department drafted the "Charter of the Central American Community," which stipulates the abolition of nationality among the five Central American countries, free migration of citizens, the establishment of joint diplomatic missions, and so on. Following this, in November 1966, the Central American Foreign Ministers' Conference adopted an agreement including the establishment of joint diplomatic missions, free migration of citizens, and ten other items. These are steps taken to establish "political integration." To suppress the national democratic struggles of the Central American people, the "Central American Joint Forces" were established under U.S. auspices in 1965.

This is the so-called "integration" that the U.S. has been boasting about, but the facts show that it is a thorough and complete neocolonialist plan.

### “经济一体化”  美帝掠夺拉丁美洲的新殖民主义工具

    “经济一体化”
    美帝掠夺拉丁美洲的新殖民主义工具
    在刚刚闭幕的“美洲国家首脑会议”上通过的“拉丁美洲经济一体化”的决定，是美帝国主义使拉丁美洲国家的经济进一步殖民地化的计划。早在十多年前，美帝国主义就开始推行“中美洲经济一体化”，对中美洲国家加紧经济渗透和掠夺。这两个“一体化”实质上是一码事。
     冲破关税壁垒倾销美国商品
    “中美洲经济一体化”的第一个重要步骤，是冲破中美洲国家原有的薄弱的关税壁垒，逐步使这个地区内部的商品免税自由流通，并使各国统一了从中美地区以外进口的商品的关税。这样，在中美洲国家进口中占统治地位的美国商品和在中美洲国家设厂的美国垄断企业的产品，就得到了在中美洲各国取得畅行无阻的便利，于是就造成了美国商品在中美洲的泛滥成灾和美国垄断资本的加速渗入，从而使中美洲国家的民族经济受到日益严重的打击。
    “经济一体化”的另一个步骤，是在“克服财政和其它资源不足对发展所造成的限制”这样一个冠冕堂皇的借口下，在中美洲国家中搞起一套“政府性或非政府性的合作计划”，例如“中美洲一体化银行”、“中美洲票据交换所”，等等。
    通过投资贷款榨取大量利润
    这些机构和措施，也首先为美国的投资、建厂等等经济渗透和掠夺活动创造了更为有利的条件。例如，“中美洲经济一体化银行”在一九六六年五月所拥有的资金是一亿美元，其中，七千五百万美元是美国的贷款。“中美洲工业研究所”在名义上负责制订全区的“发展”计划，实际却是为美国及其他外国资本家服务的一个机构。
    事实证明，实行“经济一体化”以来，美国资本控制了中美洲国家的更多的经济部门，使中美洲经济更加殖民地化。据《美国新闻与世界报道》报道，一九六五年在这个地区新建工业中的新投资，总共约为一亿五千万美元，其中美国资本占一半左右。参加投资的有美国许多家大垄断企业，包括德士古石油公司、美孚油公司等等。
    据揭露，美国在中美洲每投资一美元，就可以剥削三美元。与此同时，美国还成为中美洲最大的债主。据危地马拉《画报》今年一月二十八日指出，危地马拉外债已经达到三亿一千八百万格查尔（与美元等值）。哥斯达黎加去年欠外债十五亿科朗，在每年六亿五千万科朗的国民预算中，要用一亿五千万支付外债本利。
    “政治一体化”的前奏
    “经济一体化”是美国阴谋使中美洲国家实现“政治一体化”和“军事一体化”，进一步加强对这个地区的政治、军事控制的前奏。在加紧推行“经济一体化”的同时，一九六五年，美国国务院拟定了“中美洲共同体宪章”，其中规定中美洲五国间取消国籍，公民可以自由移居，建立联合使团等，接着在一九六六年十一月由中美洲外长会议通过了包括建立联合使团、公民自由移居等十一项内容的协定。这都是为建立“政治一体化”采取的步骤。为了镇压中美洲人民的民族民主斗争，在美国一手策划下在一九六五年成立了“中美洲共同部队”。
    这就是美国所大肆吹嘘的“一体化”，而事实表明它是一个彻头彻尾的新殖民主义计划。
