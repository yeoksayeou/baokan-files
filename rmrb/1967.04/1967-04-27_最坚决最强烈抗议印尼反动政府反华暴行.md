The Chinese government and people express great indignation at the Indonesian reactionaries' brutal trampling of international norms and their inhuman persecution of overseas Chinese. Armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people vow to be the backbone of our overseas compatriots and firmly support the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and for freedom and liberation. The Chinese and Indonesian peoples have long fought together against common enemies. No matter how much the Indonesian reactionaries destroy the relations between the two countries, the friendship between our two peoples will be tempered and strengthened in the struggle.

	New China News Agency, April 26th: The Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on April 26th, the full text of which is as follows:

	Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China
	April 26, 1967

	On April 22, 1967, under the command of the Indonesian reactionary government, hundreds of right-wing thugs surrounded the Chinese Embassy, provoking trouble. On the 23rd, the Indonesian reactionary government dispatched a large number of armed police to surround and blockade the Chinese Embassy, threatening Chinese diplomatic personnel in various ways. That afternoon, Xu Ren, the Chinese Consul-General in Jakarta, was invited to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As soon as he stepped out of the embassy gate, he was seized and forcibly taken to the 0503 Military District Command in Jakarta, where he was illegally detained for eight hours. The Indonesian reactionary government, instead of apologizing for these blatant violations of international norms and serious infringements on the personal freedom of Chinese diplomatic personnel, announced on the 24th that the Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, Yao Dengshan, and the Consul-General in Jakarta, Xu Ren, were "undesirable persons" and ordered them to leave the country by April 29.

	This is a new peak in the recent frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese activities of the Indonesian reactionary government, a serious provocation against the Chinese people, and a major step in further destroying the relations between the two countries. The Chinese government and people express great indignation at this and strongly protest against the Indonesian reactionary government.

	Since the right-wing military clique led by Suharto and Nasution seized power in a counter-revolutionary coup in 1965, they have further sold out to U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, doing everything they can to destroy the relations between China and Indonesia. They have attacked Chinese diplomatic missions more than 30 times, injuring or shooting more than 40 Chinese diplomatic personnel, consular personnel, and journalists; they have seized more than 10 Chinese diplomatic mission offices and residences; and they have committed a series of unprecedented atrocities in international diplomatic history.

	To gain the favor of the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, the Indonesian reactionary government has not hesitated to carry out large-scale, inhuman racial persecution of Chinese residents who have lived in Indonesia for generations. Over the past year, they have looted and burned Chinese shops and homes everywhere; they have hunted down Chinese residents, imprisoning tens of thousands in concentration camps and prisons; they have shot and killed Chinese residents everywhere.

	Recently, their persecution of Chinese residents has reached a more heinous level and has spread from the countryside to Jakarta. After staging the horrifying Ning Xiangyu incident, they mobilized a large number of military police and thugs on April 20 to attack Chinese residents who were attending Ning Xiangyu's funeral, creating a new and even more serious massacre. For five days, Indonesian military police and thugs in Jakarta have been looting, burning, and killing Chinese residents. Their atrocities against Chinese residents are no different from the racial atrocities committed by Hitler against Jews and by South African racists against Africans.

	It is only natural that the Chinese diplomatic representatives in Indonesia have made representations and protests against the Indonesian reactionary government's brutal persecution of Chinese residents. However, the Indonesian reactionary government has slandered the Chinese diplomatic representatives for "worsening the relations between the two countries" and declared them "undesirable persons," ordering them to leave the country within a set time. This is a complete reversal of right and wrong, a confusion of black and white, and a display of the utmost shamelessness.

	The Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese policies are not accidental; they are a complete exposure of their reactionary class nature. The right-wing military clique led by Suharto and Nasution is a tool created by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. They have turned their backs on the People's Republic of China, which has consistently supported the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism, and on the Chinese residents who have shed blood and sweat for Indonesia's national independence and economic construction. Instead, they have made U.S. imperialism, which oppresses and exploits the Indonesian people, their master, and Soviet modern revisionists, who betray Indonesia's national independence and act as imperialist lackeys, their friends. They have imposed fascist, bloody rule at home. In just over a year, they have massacred tens of thousands of outstanding children of the Indonesian revolutionary people, imprisoned tens of thousands more, and created an unprecedented white terror. Under their plundering, the Indonesian economy is in chaos, prices are soaring, people are starving, and the broad masses of workers are struggling on the brink of hunger. They have pushed Indonesia back onto the old colonial path and driven the Indonesian nation to the brink of disaster. The facts show that the Indonesian government is a thoroughgoing fascist regime.

	The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, said: "The rampant activities of all internal and external dark forces have caused national disasters; but such rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have strength, but also shows that they are making their last struggles, and that the people are gradually approaching victory." The Indonesian reactionaries have done so much evil that they will inevitably promote a broader and more intense revolution among the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people are a great revolutionary people. They have been tempered in the great storms of struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries. They will never allow the national independence they have won with their blood to be squandered by a handful of reactionaries. They will not tolerate the reactionaries riding roughshod over them. We are confident that a new revolutionary upsurge will come to Indonesia, and the Indonesian people will ultimately smash the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs in Indonesia.

	The Chinese people, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, firmly support the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and for freedom and liberation. We will support them to the end. No matter how frenziedly the Indonesian reactionaries carry out their anti-China and anti-Chinese policies, they will never shake our just stand.

	The struggle of Indonesian Chinese under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is to defend their legitimate rights, to defend the dignity of their motherland, and to defend the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples. All patriotic overseas Chinese are proud of and take pride in your struggle. The seven hundred million compatriots in the motherland vow to be your strong backbone. The Chinese government expresses its deepest concern and warmest greetings to you and believes that you will surely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite more closely, and fight to smash the reactionary persecution plots of the Indonesian reactionaries.

	The Chinese and Indonesian peoples have deep friendship. We have long fought together against common enemies. No matter how much the Indonesian reactionary government destroys the relations between the two countries, they will only reap what they sow, while the friendship between our two peoples will be tempered and strengthened in the struggle. The dark clouds currently hanging over our relations between the two countries are temporary. We are confident that, through our common struggle, the sunny days will soon come.

    我国政府就印尼反动派投靠美帝苏修肆意破坏两国关系发表声明
    最坚决最强烈抗议印尼反动政府反华暴行
    中国政府和人民，对印尼反动派粗暴地践踏国际关系准则，丧心病狂地迫害华侨，表示极大愤慨。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，誓作我国侨胞的后盾，坚决支持印尼人民反帝反殖和争取自由解放的斗争。中国人民和印尼人民曾为反对共同敌人进行过长期斗争，不论印尼反动派把两国关系破坏到什么地步，我们两国人民的友谊必将在斗争中得到新的锻炼和加强。
    新华社二十六日讯　中华人民共和国政府二十六日发表声明，全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府声明
                        一九六七年四月二十六日
    一九六七年四月二十二日，在印尼反动政府指挥下，数百名右派暴徒包围中国大使馆，进行挑衅。二十三日，印尼反动政府又派遣大批武装军警，包围和封锁了中国大使馆，对中国外交人员进行种种威胁。当天下午，中国驻雅加达总领事徐仁应约前往印尼外交部，一出大使馆门口，就遭到印尼军警的武装劫持，并被强行押送到雅加达0503军支区司令部，非法扣留达八小时之久。印尼反动政府对上述种种粗暴践踏国际关系准则、严重侵犯中国外交人员人身自由的暴行，不但不低头认罪，反而在二十四日，悍然宣布中国驻印尼大使馆临时代办姚登山和驻雅加达总领事徐仁为“不受欢迎的人”，并且限定他们在四月二十九日以前离境。
    这是印尼反动政府最近猖狂反华排华活动的新高峰，是对中国人民的严重挑衅，是进一步破坏两国关系的重大步骤。中国政府和中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨，并且向印尼反动政府提出最坚决、最强烈的抗议。
    以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的右派军人集团，自从一九六五年发动反革命政变篡夺政权以来，就进一步卖身投靠美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义，极力破坏中国和印尼两国的关系。他们袭击中国外交代表机构三十多次，枪伤、打伤中国外交人员、领事人员和记者四十多名；霸占中国外交代表机构的办公处和宿舍十多处；制造了一系列国际外交史上罕见的暴行。
    为了取得投靠美帝和苏修的资本，印尼反动政府竟然不惜对长期旅居印尼的中国侨民，进行大规模的、惨无人道的种族主义迫害。一年多以来，他们到处抢掠焚烧华侨商店和住宅；到处搜捕华侨，把成千上万的华侨关进集中营和监狱；到处开枪打死打伤华侨。
    最近，他们这种迫害华侨的活动，发展到了更加丧心病狂的地步，并且已经从外地扩展到了雅加达。他们在制造了骇人听闻的宁祥雨事件之后，又于四月二十日出动大批军警和暴徒，袭击为宁祥雨送葬的华侨，制造了新的更加严重的流血惨案。五天以来，印尼军警和暴徒在雅加达，对华侨大抢、大烧、大杀。他们对华侨的种种暴行，同当年希特勒对待犹太人和现在南非种族主义者对待非洲人的种族主义暴行，毫无二致。
    对于印尼反动政府残酷迫害华侨的暴行，中国驻印尼外交代表提出交涉和抗议，这是理所当然的。但是，印尼反动政府却诬蔑中国外交代表“恶化了两国关系”，并且宣布他们为“不受欢迎的人”，限期勒令离境。这真是颠倒是非，混淆黑白，无赖无耻，到了极点。
    印尼反动政府的反华排华，决不是偶然的，这完全是它的反动阶级本性的大暴露。以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的右派军人集团，本来就是美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义一手豢养起来的。他们倒行逆施，把一贯支持印尼人民反帝反殖斗争的中华人民共和国当作敌人，把为印尼民族独立和经济建设事业流过血流过汗的华侨当作敌人，而把压迫和剥削印尼人民的美帝国主义当作主子，把出卖印尼民族独立、充当帝国主义帮凶的苏联现代修正主义者当作朋友。他们对内实行法西斯血腥统治。短短一年多的时间，他们屠杀了几十万印尼革命人民的优秀儿女，把成千上万的革命人民投入监狱，造成了史无前例的白色恐怖。在他们的巧取豪夺之下，印尼经济十分紊乱，物价飞涨，民不聊生，广大劳动人民在饥饿线上挣扎。他们已经把印尼推回到殖民地的老路上去，把印尼民族推向灾难的深渊。事实表明，印尼政府是一个彻头彻尾的法西斯政权。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席说：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”印尼反动派做尽了坏事，必将促进印尼人民更广泛更激烈的革命。印尼人民是伟大的革命的人民。他们在反对国内外反动派斗争的大风大浪中，久经锻炼。他们绝不会允许自己用鲜血换来的民族独立被一小撮反动派葬送掉。他们绝不会容忍反动派骑在自己的头上横行霸道。我们坚信，印尼新的革命高潮必将到来，印尼人民终将冲垮帝国主义及其走狗在印尼的反动统治。
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，坚决支持印尼人民反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义和争取自由解放的革命斗争。我们是支持定了的。无论印尼反动派怎样猖獗地反华排华，也绝不能动摇我们这种正义的立场。
    印尼华侨高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗所进行的斗争，是为了维护自己的正当权益，是为了维护祖国的尊严，是为了维护中国、印尼人民的友谊。一切爱国华侨为你们的斗争感到光荣和骄傲。祖国七亿同胞誓作你们的坚强后盾。中国政府对你们表示最深切的关怀和最亲切的慰问，相信你们一定会更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更紧密地团结起来，为彻底粉碎印尼反动派的迫害阴谋而斗争。
    中国人民和印尼人民有着深厚的友谊。我们两国人民曾经为反对共同敌人进行过长期斗争。不论印尼反动政府把两国关系破坏到什么地步，他们只能是自食其果，而我们两国人民的友谊必将在斗争中得到新的锻炼和加强。目前笼罩在我们两国关系上的乌云是暂时的。我们深信，经过共同的斗争，充满阳光的日子，必将很快到来。
