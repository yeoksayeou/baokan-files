The proletarian revolutionary faction of the First Thermal Power Plant in Taiyuan, with the strong support of the soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Shanxi Provincial Military Region, has been vigorously promoting the revolution and production. They completed the first quarter's production plan three days and fourteen hours ahead of schedule. The plant's total output, electricity generation, and heat supply, among other major production indicators, have all increased by about twenty percent compared to the same period last year. They have also created a new historical high of operating at 5.2 percent above the equipment's rated capacity, achieving zero-accident safe operation.

After implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary faction of this plant, under the active support of the People's Liberation Army, established two leadership teams: the Revolutionary Committee and the Production Committee. They resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," conducted a thorough ideological revolution among the people, and persistently armed the worker masses with Mao Zedong Thought to transform the enterprise and manage production.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of this plant also resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great call to "be thrifty and revolutionary." They upheld the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, hard struggle, and thrift in running the enterprise. Since February, the worker masses have proposed forty-five innovation projects, of which thirty-two have been implemented, saving the state more than 270,000 yuan.

    太原第一热电厂
    提前完成第一季度生产计划
    太原第一热电厂的无产阶级革命派在山西省军区某部指战员的大力支持下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，提前三天零十四个小时全面完成了第一季度的生产计划。这个厂的总产值、发电量、供热量等主要生产指标都比去年同期提高百分之二十左右，并且创造了超设备容量百分之五点二运行的历史最高水平，作到了无事故安全运行。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派实行革命的“三结合”联合夺权以后，在解放军的积极支持下，成立了革命和生产委员会两套领导班子，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，大搞人的思想革命化，坚持用毛泽东思想武装职工群众，改造企业，管理生产。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派还坚决贯彻执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，发扬了自力更生、艰苦奋斗、勤俭办企业的革命精神。从二月份以来，工人群众先后提出四十五项革新项目，其中已实现了三十二项，可为国家节省二十七万多元资金。
