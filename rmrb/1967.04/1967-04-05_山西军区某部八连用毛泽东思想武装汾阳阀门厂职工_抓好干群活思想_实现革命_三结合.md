The Eighth Company of a certain unit of the Shanxi Military Region, which has been supporting industrial production at the Fenyang Valve Factory, has prioritized helping cadres and workers to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works and to understand the Party's policies. This has promoted the correct handling of cadres by the revolutionary masses of the factory and the voluntary participation of revolutionary cadres in the revolution. Now, the factory has established a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership body, focusing on the revolution and vigorously promoting production. The revolutionary workers and cadres of the entire factory are full of enthusiasm and fighting spirit, making the revolution boil and completing production tasks excellently.

After entering the Fenyang Valve Factory, the Eighth Company first followed Chairman Mao's instruction of "no investigation, no right to speak" and established an investigation team to understand the active thoughts of cadres and workers. Through the investigation, the comrades of the Eighth Company realized that how to handle cadres was the main issue in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the factory. The revolutionary masses of the factory, influenced by the proposal of the proponents of the bourgeois reactionary line to generally reject and overthrow cadres, did not fully trust revolutionary cadres. Meanwhile, a handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road took advantage of the situation to spread the fallacy of "everyone has made mistakes," attempting to prevent revolutionary leading cadres from coming forward to participate in the revolution. Based on these circumstances, the comrades of the Eighth Company decided to tackle the issue from two aspects: to address the active thoughts of the revolutionary masses, eliminating the erroneous view of "overthrowing everything"; and to address the active thoughts of cadres, educating them to stand up and join the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, correcting their shortcomings, and actively participating in the revolution.

During the investigation, the comrades of the Eighth Company discovered that a group of cadres, represented by Deputy Director Cui Zhen of the factory, had good class backgrounds and had undergone revolutionary struggles. Although they had made some mistakes in their work, they had diligently done a lot for the Party. The Eighth Company's soldiers, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "be good at turning the Party's policies into the actions of the masses," patiently helped the factory's proletarian revolutionary factions to learn Chairman Mao's cadre policies and to master the weapon of class analysis, re-evaluating the cadres within the factory.

The revolutionary masses, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, immediately became clear-headed. They presented facts, reasoned logically, expressed their views, and had heart-to-heart talks, conducting specific analyses of the leading cadres such as Deputy Director Cui Zhen. The revolutionary factions unanimously expressed that Comrade Cui Zhen was a reliable revolutionary cadre and a close comrade-in-arms of the revolutionary masses, and that he should be invited to join the proletarian revolutionary command center, becoming the core and backbone of the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions.

The comrades of the Eighth Company believed that whether revolutionary cadres could gain the trust and support of the revolutionary masses in the torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution depended on whether the cadres themselves could use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to consciously, seriously, and continuously transform their worldviews, correctly handle their relationships with the masses, correctly handle themselves, and clearly distinguish themselves from the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road and from the bourgeois reactionary line, firmly standing on the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and fighting shoulder to shoulder with the broad revolutionary masses. Therefore, the soldiers also conducted painstaking and detailed ideological work with the revolutionary cadres of the factory and those who had made some mistakes.

The revolutionary leading cadres and ordinary cadres of the Valve Factory, due to the slander and provocation by a handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, were suspected by some revolutionary masses and generally showed fear and many concerns. The soldiers, based on Chairman Mao's instructions, analyzed the active thoughts of the cadre team and believed that it was necessary to first help Deputy Director Cui Zhen to come forward, setting a living example for the revolutionary cadres of the entire factory. After several individual talks with Cui Zhen, they found that Cui Zhen was afraid of this and that, ultimately fearing criticism and the masses. They helped him to study Chairman Mao's instructions on believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and correctly handling revolutionary mass movements, encouraging him to firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and to fight alongside the masses to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. The soldiers also helped Cui Zhen to recall past hardships and arouse his deep class feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao. They patiently helped him to repeatedly study the "Three Articles" and to carry out a revolution in his soul, eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness. Through study, Cui Zhen actively approached the revolutionary mass organizations, on one hand, conducting a relatively profound self-examination of his shortcomings and mistakes in his work and the movement, and seriously listening to everyone's criticisms, and on the other hand, exposing the crimes of the power-holders within the factory who were taking the capitalist road.

Cui Zhen won the trust of the revolutionary masses with his actions. The revolutionary masses invited him to join the "three-in-one combination" leadership committee and elected him as the deputy director of this committee.

After the revolutionary leading cadres came forward, they inspired many ordinary cadres to also actively come forward, joining the broad revolutionary masses in the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Currently, in every link of guiding the revolution and managing production in the factory, there are revolutionary cadres participating.

    山西军区某部八连用毛泽东思想武装汾阳阀门厂职工
    抓好干群活思想　实现革命“三结合”
    据新华社太原三日电  到汾阳阀门厂支持工业生产工作的山西省军区某部八连指战员，把帮助干部和群众活学活用毛主席著作和掌握党的方针政策摆在第一位，促进了这个厂的无产阶级革命派正确地对待干部和革命干部自觉地站出来革命。现在，这个厂已经组成一个革命的
  “三结合”的领导机构，狠抓革命，猛促生产。全厂革命职工、革命干部意气风发，斗志昂扬，革命搞得热气腾腾，生产任务完成得很出色。
    八连进入汾阳阀门厂后，首先遵照毛主席“没有调查就没有发言权”的教导，成立了调查小组，到干部和群众中去了解他们的活思想。经过调查，八连的同志认识到，怎样对待干部，是这个厂当前无产阶级文化大革命运动中的主要问题。这个厂的革命群众，由于受到资产阶级反动路线的提出者对干部一概排斥、一概打倒的主张的影响，对革命干部不够信任；而党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派也混水摸鱼，大肆散布“错误人人有份”的谬论，企图阻止革命的领导干部站出来革命。根据这些情况，八连的同志决定从两方面入手，既抓革命群众的活思想，肃清“打倒一切”的错误观点；又抓干部的活思想，教育他们挺身而出，站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，改正缺点，自觉革命。
    在调查过程中，八连的同志发现，这个厂以副厂长崔珍为代表的一批干部，阶级出身好，经历过革命斗争的锻炼，虽然在工作中犯过一些错误，但是为党兢兢业业地做了许多工作。八连指战员根据毛主席“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动”的教导，耐心地帮助工厂无产阶级革命派，学习毛主席的干部政策，掌握阶级分析这一武器，重新认识厂内的干部。
    革命群众掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，立即心明眼亮。他们摆事实，讲道理，亮观点，互相谈心，对副厂长崔珍等领导干部进行了具体分析。革命派并一致表示，崔珍同志是可以信赖的革命干部，是革命群众的亲密战友，一定要吸收他到无产阶级的革命司令部里来，成为无产阶级革命派大联合的核心和骨干。
    八连同志认为，革命的干部能不能在文化大革命的洪流中得到革命群众的信任和欢迎，关键在于干部自己能不能用毛泽东思想为武器，自觉地、认真地、不断地改造自己的世界观，正确对待群众，正确对待自己，彻底同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派划清界限，同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，坚决地站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，和广大革命群众一起并肩战斗。因此，指战员们对厂里的革命干部以及犯了一些错误的干部，也进行了艰苦细致的思想工作。
    阀门厂的革命领导干部和一般干部，由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的挑拨中伤，受到一些革命群众的怀疑，普遍表现怕字当头，有不少顾虑。指战员根据毛主席的教导，分析了干部队伍的活思想，认为必须首先帮助副厂长崔珍站出来，为全厂革命干部树立活样板。他们经过几次同崔珍个别谈话，了解到，崔珍怕这怕那，归根结底还是害怕批评、害怕群众。他们就帮助他学习毛主席有关相信群众，依靠群众，正确对待革命的群众运动的教导，鼓励他坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。指战员们还和崔珍一起进行忆苦思甜，唤起他对党和毛主席的深厚阶级感情。指战员们并耐心帮助他反复学习“老三篇”，在灵魂深处闹革命，破私立公。经过学习，崔珍主动靠拢革命群众组织，一面对自己工作和运动中的缺点和错误作了比较深刻的检查，并且认真倾听大家的批评，一面揭发厂内走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。
    崔珍以自己的行动取得了革命群众的信任。革命群众吸收他参加了“三结合”的领导班子革命委员会，并且推选他担任这个委员会的副主任。
    革命的领导干部站出来后，带动了许多一般干部也主动站出来，和广大革命群众一起，投入轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动。目前，这个厂指导革命和管理生产的各个环节中，都有革命干部参加。
