The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, and the broad revolutionary masses responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production." The revolutionary situation in the entire factory was excellent. However, a handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road manipulated some conservative organizations to launch a frenzied counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary faction. They openly resisted Chairman Mao's directive to "seize the revolution and promote production" and put forward the slogan of "revolution first, production later." They deliberately incited workers to disregard labor discipline and leave their posts without authorization. They also, under the guise of breaking old frameworks and regulations, engaged in economic adventurism, and so on.

I was formerly the deputy director of the factory, always in charge of production management. Facing this situation, I was extremely anxious. At this time, a handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, in order to save themselves, played the trick of sacrificing the pawn to save the king. They forced me to leave my post in charge of production and pushed me to the most acute point of conflict in the entire factory at that time, to handle issues related to labor wages and labor protection. These cunning enemies then retreated to the second and third lines. Because I had the "self" and "fear" in my mind, I did not dare to uphold the Party's principles and executed the bourgeois reactionary line, engaging in economic adventurism. As a result, I was criticized and struggled against by the masses.

In this situation, my mood was complex. I really wanted to do some work in production, but facing the criticism and struggle from the masses, I could not rally my spirits. I once thought, "It's better to just lie down and not do anything, to avoid making bigger mistakes later," "Being an official is really difficult, it's better to resign." But then I thought, how can I, as a Communist Party member, consider problems by placing myself in opposition to the masses?

How should I proceed? With these questions in mind, I studied the works of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said, "Because we serve the people, so if we have shortcomings, we should not fear others pointing them out." He also said, "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any errors that we cannot abandon?" I read these words over and over again, seriously. The more intense the struggle, the more I felt close to them. Chairman Mao's teachings gave me the strength and courage to overcome selfishness and all difficulties. I began to calm down and seriously reflect on my own problems. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I executed the bourgeois reactionary line, and it was entirely right for the masses to criticize me. It was to help me draw a clear line between myself and the bourgeois reactionary line, to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. My thoughts improved, and I could adopt a welcoming attitude towards the masses' criticism. Towards some excessive words, I could also treat them more correctly. As a Communist Party member, one absolutely cannot be bothered by these non-mainstream things in the mass movement. My selfishness was somewhat overcome, and my spiritual state was completely different. I raised my head and straightened my back, daring to work again. I strove to make up for my past mistakes with my actual actions and stood in the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary faction.

The revolutionary situation developed rapidly, and the proletarian revolutionary faction repelled the reactionary forces both inside and outside the factory. The balance of class forces changed significantly, and the proletarian revolutionary faction held an absolute advantage. I was genuinely happy from the bottom of my heart, and I was willing to work hard under the help of the revolutionary comrades. At this time, a new problem arose: should I stand up and join the revolutionary faction to work together? I hesitated, mainly because I was afraid the masses would not trust me. I even thought, "It's better to first regard myself as the object of the revolution, and then become the driving force of the revolution!" Obviously, this idea was wrong. The revolutionary object and revolutionary driving force mentioned here are a unity of opposites, they cannot be separated, and there is no order of precedence. Seeing the fearless revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary comrades, it was truly admirable and worthy of learning from!

After correcting my wrong thoughts, I actively approached the masses, got close to the revolutionary organizations, and shared my thoughts, views, and determination with them, and offered suggestions. This action immediately received the welcome and encouragement of the revolutionary masses. After the revolutionary faction in my factory seized power, I was invited to participate in the temporary power organ of the factory-level "three-in-one" revolutionary committee.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power, the new and more arduous task was how to properly exercise power. There was a lot of work to be done, and first of all, it was to seize the revolution and promote production. The good or bad of production depended on people's spiritual state, so we vigorously promoted the study of Chairman Mao's works, which was the top priority. We, who participated in the production leadership team, paid great attention to Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line. Chairman Mao said, "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, only by relying on the masses can we wage war." In work, we must fully trust the masses, consult with the masses on matters, and follow the mass line. Relying on the power of the masses, we overcame one difficulty after another in production and broke through one barrier after another. Especially with the help and support of the comrades from the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, the entire factory quickly launched a high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production, rapidly raising the production level. Some products' daily output created a new record since the factory's establishment, and steel, iron, and materials exceeded the February plan. In the first half of March, while ensuring product quality, the plan was also exceeded. Thus, the passive situation of the entire factory was quickly reversed, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction and greatly dampening the spirit of the class enemies. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing deeply. I am determined to learn from the experiences and lessons of the past few months, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to constantly reform myself, to firmly stand with the proletarian revolutionary faction, to closely unite with the masses, to follow the mass line in work, and to resolutely and effectively implement Chairman Mao's directive to "seize the revolution and promote production." In the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production struggle, I will achieve new merits.

    克服私心杂念和革命派站在一起
    济南铁厂革命委员会常委　高几何
    无产阶级文化大革命一开始，广大革命群众响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，全厂的革命形势好得很。但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，操纵一些保守组织，向无产阶级革命派进行疯狂的反扑。他们公然抵制毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，提出“先革命、后生产”的口号；他们故意煽动工人不遵守劳动纪律，擅自离开生产岗位；他们还以打破“旧框框”、“老规章”为名，大搞经济主义，等等。
    我原任副厂长，一直负责管理生产，面对这种局面，非常焦急。就在这时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派为了保存自己，玩弄丢车保帅的阴谋。他们迫使我离开管理生产的岗位，把我推到当时全厂矛盾最尖锐的地方，负责解决劳动工资和劳动保护等问题。这些狡猾的敌人则退居二线、三线。由于我头脑中有“私”字，有“怕”字，不敢坚持党的原则，执行了资产阶级反动路线，搞了经济主义，因而受到了群众的批判和斗争。
    在这种情况下，我的心情是复杂的。我确实想在生产上做点工作，但是，面对群众的批判和斗争，振作不起来。我曾想过：“干脆躺下来不干算了，免得以后犯更大的错误”，“干部真难当，不如罢了官好。”但又一想，我是一个共产党员，怎么能把自己摆在和群众对立的地位来考虑问题呢？
    到底如何是好？带着这些问题，我学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”又说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”这些话我反复地读，认真地读，越是在斗争紧张的时候，读起来越是感到亲切。毛主席的教导给了我战胜私心杂念和一切困难的力量和勇气。我开始冷静下来，严肃地思索自己的问题。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我执行了资产阶级反动路线，群众批判我是完全应该的，是为了帮助我和资产阶级反动路线划清界限，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。思想提高了，对群众的批判，就能采取欢迎的态度。对于一些过激的话，也就能比较正确地对待。作为一个共产党员，绝不能计较群众运动中这些非主流的东西。自己的私心杂念有所克服，在精神状态上也判若两人，我又抬起头来，挺起腰杆，敢于工作了。我努力用自己的实际行动来弥补过去的过失，和无产阶级革命派战斗在一起。
    革命形势的发展迅猛异常，无产阶级革命派打退了内外纠结在一起的反动势力，阶级力量对比发生了很大的变化，无产阶级革命派占了绝对的优势。我打心眼里高兴，我愿意在革命闯将们的帮助下好好工作。这时，一个新的问题提出来了，我要不要站出来和革命派结合在一起共同工作？我犹豫不定，主要是怕群众不相信自己。甚至想：“干脆先把自己当作革命的对象，以后再作革命的动力吧！”显然，这种想法是错误的。这里所说的革命对象和革命动力是对立的统一，是不能分家的，不能分先后的。眼看革命小将们大无畏的革命精神，真是可钦可敬，应该虚心向他们学习！
    纠正了错误思想以后，我主动接近群众，靠拢革命组织，向他们亮思想，摆观点，表决心，出点子。我这一行动，立即得到了革命群众的欢迎和鼓励。我厂革命派在夺权以后，我被吸收参加了厂级革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构。
    无产阶级革命派夺权以后，新的更加艰巨的任务是如何掌好权的问题。要做的工作很多，首先是抓革命，促生产。生产的好坏，取决于人的精神状态，因此，我们狠抓了毛主席著作的学习，这是首要的首要。我们参加生产领导班子的同志，很注意毛主席关于群众路线的教导。毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”在工作中一定要充分相信群众，遇事和群众商量，走群众路线。我们依靠群众的力量，克服了生产中一个又一个的困难，闯过了一个又一个难关。特别在济南部队毛泽东思想宣传队驻厂同志的帮助和支持下，全厂很快掀起抓革命、促生产的高潮，使生产水平迅速直线上升。有的产品的日产量，创造了建厂以来的最高纪录，钢、铁、材超额完成了二月份计划。三月份上半月，在保证产品质量基础上，均超额完成了计划。这样，迅速扭转了全厂的被动局面，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的气焰。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命正在深入发展，我决心吸取几个月的经验教训，活学活用毛主席著作，不断改造自己，坚决地和无产阶级革命派站在一起，和群众密切结合，在工作中走群众路线，坚决地切实地执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命和生产斗争中立新功。
