Albanian Military Delegation Deputy Leader Comrade Chako, during his report on his visit to China, pointed out that the People's Liberation Army of China is a powerful pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Tirana, April 6 (New China News Agency) - Recently, the Albanian military delegation's deputy leader and head of the political department of the Albanian People's Army, Comrade Hysni Chako, delivered a report on his visit to China to the faculty, students, and staff of the natural sciences department at the University of Tirana.

Comrade Chako, in his report, enthusiastically praised the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao. He said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is being conducted under the leadership of the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. Its victory is a great victory for Marxism-Leninism, a great victory for the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the international proletariat. It is a severe and fatal blow to the schemes of imperialism and revisionism to seize the fortress from within and use the Trojan horse method to change the color of China, turning it into a revisionist country."

When talking about Chairman Mao's reception of the Albanian military delegation, Comrade Chako said, "Comrade Mao Zedong is in good health. This brings immense joy to the entire Chinese people, the international proletariat, all Marxist-Leninists in the world, the Albanian people, and the Albanian Labor Party."

In his report, Comrade Chako highly praised the firm beliefs, strong will, optimism, and internationalism of the Chinese people in their socialist revolution and socialist construction. He praised the People's Liberation Army of China as a powerful tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat that implements Mao Zedong Thought.

He also cited vivid examples to illustrate the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army of China in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

    阿军事代表团副团长恰科同志作访华报告时指出
    中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的强大支柱
    新华社地拉那电　不久前访问中国的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团副团长、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希·恰科一日向地拉那大学自然科学系师生和职工作访华报告。
    恰科同志在报告中热烈赞扬由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利。
    恰科同志说，中国无产阶级文化大革命是在杰出的马克思列宁主义者、中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志领导下进行的。它的胜利是马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利，是中国人民、中国共产党和国际无产阶级的伟大胜利；它对帝国主义、修正主义企图从内部夺取堡垒，用特洛伊木马的办法使中国变色，变成修正主义国家的阴谋，是一个重大的致命的打击。
    恰科同志在谈到毛主席接见阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团的情景时说，毛泽东同志的身体很健康。这使全中国人民、国际无产阶级、全世界马克思列宁主义者、阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党感到无比高兴。
    恰科同志在报告中高度赞扬中国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的坚定信念、坚强意志和乐观主义以及他们的国际主义精神；赞扬中国人民解放军是执行毛泽东思想的强大的无产阶级专政的工具。
    他还列举生动的事例说明，中国人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作的巨大成就。
