In our great motherland, the capital, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been triumphantly born! It is like a spring thunder that shakes the entire world!

The birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee declares to all of China and the world the complete collapse of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee. It shatters the dream of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party who attempted to restore capitalism.

The birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee declares to all of China and the world: we proletarian revolutionaries are heroes, while those counter-revolutionary revisionists are all paper tigers. In the face of the revolutionary people, they will inevitably suffer a humiliating defeat.

Ironclad facts once again prove the wise judgment of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao: "The people, and only the people, are the motive force in the making of world history."

Today, the hearts of the proletarian revolutionaries of the new Peking University are filled with such excitement! We will never forget that it was our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao who personally initiated and led this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, saving Peking University.

For a long time, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the former Beijing Municipal Committee turned Peking University into a stronghold for the restoration of capitalism. With their support, the former Party Committee Secretary of Peking University, Lu Ping, and Deputy Secretary Peng Peiyun, along with other counter-revolutionary revisionists, colluded with reactionary academic "authorities" to tyrannize and bully, displaying their might and brutally persecuting and suppressing the proletarian revolutionaries. At that time, these counter-revolutionary revisionists were so arrogant. They, under the guise of rectification, personally led the so-called "International Hotel" conference, attacking our proletarian revolutionaries at Peking University for seven months. They labeled many revolutionary comrades as "counter-revolutionaries," creating horrifying "counter-revolutionary incidents." At that time, revolution was considered "guilty," and rebellion was deemed "unreasonable." It was truly a time of darkness, where right and wrong were reversed, and humans and demons were mixed.

On May 16th of last year, under the call of Chairman Mao for the proletarian cultural revolution and inspired by the nationwide outcry against the "Three Family Village" within the former Beijing Municipal Committee, we could no longer sit still. We wanted to fight! We wanted to rebel!

Chairman Mao taught us: Those bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, government, army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will attempt to seize power, turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. To defend Mao Zedong Thought, to safeguard the proletarian dictatorship, and to protect our great socialist motherland, on the 25th, we broke through the counter-revolutionary revisionist's black discipline and posted big-character posters to attack the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee and the counter-revolutionary revisionists of the Peking University Party Committee. However, Lu Ping and his cohorts immediately organized a fierce counterattack. During that period, we missed Chairman Mao so much! We believed that he would definitely support us.

An unforgettable day arrived. On June 1st, Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast this big-character poster nationwide and praised it as "the first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster in the country." The support of the great leader was the greatest care and encouragement for us. The wise decision of the great leader ignited the blazing fire of the proletarian cultural revolution nationwide and sounded the charge for seizing power from the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party. Peking University's proletarian revolutionaries were liberated, and Peking University was reborn!

From the posting of this big-character poster to the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, history has undergone a dramatic change. Under the leadership of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, we experienced a heart-pounding class struggle. We smashed the bourgeois reactionary line executed by the new municipal committee's work team sent by the number one capitalist-roader within the party, developing and strengthening the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries. Now, the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists has finally fallen from their seats, the old Peking University has been overturned by us, the old municipal committee has been overturned by us, and the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the party who supported them has been exposed. History has justly declared that we have won!

"Who dominates the rises and falls of the vast earth?" The struggle has educated us, and we have won the victory. The fundamental question of the revolution is the question of power. With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. The great power of the revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries must seize, or who will? The great seal of the revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries must hold, or who will? We seize power for the proletariat and the working people. We seize power for the liberation of all oppressed and exploited people in the world. Our power is secured! We will never allow the counter-revolutionary revisionists to drag history backward! The ship of history can only sail forward according to the will of the proletarian revolutionaries and the course indicated by Mao Zedong Thought!

Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful spiritual atomic bomb. The history of the proletarian cultural revolution shows that the counter-revolutionary revisionists fear Mao Zedong Thought the most and fear the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought the most. History is stern. Anyone who opposes the party, the people, socialism, and our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, attempting to restore capitalism in China, will have no good ending.

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage and not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." The birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li. The class struggle has not ended. Currently, the nationwide mass movement to thoroughly criticize the number one capitalist-roader within the party is rising. We must criticize him thoroughly in politics, ideology, and theory, achieving a thorough criticism through the great criticism. We must seize power well and use power well. We must forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of rebellion of the proletariat, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever follow Chairman Mao to advance through the great waves of class struggle!

    问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？
    北京大学  聂元梓　夏剑豸　宋一秀  赵正义　高云鹏　李醒尘
    在我们伟大祖国的首都，北京市革命委员会胜利地诞生了！它象一声春雷震撼着整个世界的大地！
    北京市革命委员会的诞生，向全中国、全世界宣告了旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的彻底崩溃，粉碎了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派妄图复辟资本主义的美梦。
    北京市革命委员会的诞生，向全中国、全世界宣告：我们无产阶级革命派是英雄好汉，而那些反革命修正主义分子统统都是纸老虎。在革命人民面前，他们必然碰得头破血流，遭到可耻的失败。
    铁的事实再一次证明了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    今天，我们新北大的无产阶级革命派的心情是何等的激动啊！我们永远也不会忘记，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，挽救了我们北京大学。
    长期以来，旧北京市委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，把北大变成了复辟资本主义的一个顽固堡垒。在他们的支持下，北大的旧党委书记陆平、副书记彭珮云等反革命修正主义分子，勾结反动学术“权威”，在北大横行霸道，耀武扬威，残酷迫害和镇压无产阶级革命派。那时，这一小撮反革命修正主义分子是那样的嚣张，他们假借整风名义，亲自赤膊上阵，召开了所谓“国际饭店”会议，轮番围攻我们北大无产阶级革命派达七个月之久。他们把许多革命同志打成“反革命”，制造了骇人听闻的“反革命事件”。那时，革命反而“有罪”，造反竟然“无理”，真是黑云压城城欲摧，是非颠倒人妖混。
    去年五月十六日，在毛主席发出无产阶级文化大革命的号召下，在全国人民愤怒声讨旧北京市委内“三家村”的鼓舞下，我们再也坐不住了，我们要斗争！我们要反抗！
    毛主席教导我们说：混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。为了捍卫毛泽东思想，为了保卫无产阶级专政，为了保卫伟大的社会主义祖国，二十五日我们冲破了反革命修正主义的黑纪律，贴出了向旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团和北大党委反革命修正主义分子开火的大字报。但是，陆平们立刻组织了疯狂的反扑。在那段日子里，我们是多么想念毛主席啊！我们相信他老人家一定会支持我们。
    一个难忘的日子来到了。六月一日，毛主席亲自决定在全国广播发表这张大字报，并赞扬它是“全国第一张马列主义的大字报”。伟大领袖的支持，是对我们最大的关怀和鼓舞。伟大领袖的这个英明决定，在全国范围内点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，吹响了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的进军号。北京大学的无产阶级革命派解放了，北京大学新生了！
    从这张大字报的发表，到北京市革命委员会的成立，历史发生了天翻地覆的变化。我们在伟大统帅毛主席的领导下，经历了一场惊心动魄的阶级斗争。我们粉碎了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派通过新市委派出的工作组所执行的资产阶级反动路线，发展、壮大了无产阶级革命派的队伍。现在，一小撮反革命修正主义分子终于跌下了宝座，旧北大被我们打翻了，旧市委被我们打翻了，在背后支持他们的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派也被揪出来了。历史公正地宣告，我们胜利了！
    “问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？”斗争教育了我们，我们赢得了胜利。革命的根本问题是政权问题，有了政权就有了一切，没有政权，就丧失一切。革命的大权，我们无产阶级革命派不掌，谁掌？革命的大印，我们无产阶级革命派不握，谁握？我们是为无产阶级和劳动人民掌权，我们是为全世界一切被剥削、被压迫人民的解放掌权，我们的权掌定了！我们绝不允许反革命修正主义分子把历史拉向倒退！历史的航船只能按照无产阶级革命派的意志，按照毛泽东思想所指引的航道前进！
    毛泽东思想是最强大的精神原子弹。无产阶级文化大革命的历史表明，反革命修正主义分子最怕的就是毛泽东思想，最怕的就是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众。历史是严峻的。谁反党、反人民、反社会主义、反对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，妄图在中国复辟资本主义，他就绝没有好下场。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”北京市革命委员会的诞生，只不过是万里长征的第一步，阶级斗争并没有结束。当前，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的群众运动正在全国兴起，我们一定要从政治上、思想上、理论上把他彻底批倒、批臭、批深、批透，通过大批判实现革命派的大联合。我们一定要掌好权，用好权。我们一定要永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，继续发扬无产阶级的革命造反精神，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远跟着毛主席迎着阶级斗争的大风大浪前进！
