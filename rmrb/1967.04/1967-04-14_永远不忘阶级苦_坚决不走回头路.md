The top capitalist-roader in the Party is yearning for capitalism and shamelessly whitewashing capitalists. He says things like, “The working people do not oppose exploitation, but welcome it,” “Workers want you to exploit them, otherwise they will suffer greatly,” and so on. These extremely reactionary fallacies fully reveal that he is not a “veteran revolutionary” but a fake revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary.

Chairman Mao teaches us that we must never forget class struggle. I am a child who grew up in a sea of bitterness. In the old society, I suffered tremendously from the brutal exploitation and oppression of capitalists and foremen. The bitter life of being worse than cattle for ten days and nights cannot be fully described. At the age of seven, I lost my parents. At the age of eight, I entered a cotton mill as a child laborer. Because I was small and weak, I often got slapped and whipped. At the age of eleven, I was tricked into working in a cotton mill in Shanghai. The world is full of black crows, and the hearts of capitalists and foremen are all vicious. Besides working hard for the capitalists during the day, after work I had to wash clothes and sweep the floor for the foremen. If the foremen were not satisfied, they would beat me. Once, I overworked and fainted on the loom, injuring the back of my head. I lay in bed for more than a month. When I recovered and went back to work, the capitalist fined me for working a year without pay. The hearts of capitalists are more poisonous than snakes and more ferocious than wolves! But the top capitalist-roader in the Party whitewashes capitalists and tells us to forget class struggle, which is absolutely impossible!

Chairman Mao teaches us: “The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them.” Now is the crucial moment for the decisive battle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. We must act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions. We, the working class, must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly criticize the top capitalist-roader in the Party, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    永远不忘阶级苦　坚决不走回头路
    上海市先进工作者、国棉十二厂五好工人　刘兰英
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派一心向往资本主义，厚颜无耻地为资本家涂脂抹粉。他说什么“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削”，“工人要你剥削，不剥削人家就苦得很”，等等。这些反动透顶的谬论，充分说明他根本不是什么“老革命”，而是假革命，是反革命。
    毛主席教导我们，千万不要忘记阶级斗争。我是在苦海里泡大的苦孩子，在旧社会里受尽了资本家、工头的残酷剥削和压迫，牛马不如的苦难生活十天十夜也讲不完。这种血海深仇，我永世也不会忘记。七岁那年，我就失去了父母，刚满八岁就进纱厂当童工，因人小力气小，经常吃耳光、挨皮鞭。我十一岁就被骗到上海一家纱厂里做工。天下乌鸦一般黑，资本家、工头的心都是毒辣的。我除了白天给资本家拚命做工外，放工后还要给工头洗衣服、拖地板。工头稍不如意，就拳打脚踢。有一次，我劳累过度，昏倒在布机上，后脑被撞伤，躺了一个多月。等我病好再去上班时，资本家要罚我白做一年，不给工资。资本家的心真是比毒蛇还毒，比豺狼还狠！可是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派替资本家涂脂抹粉，叫我们忘记阶级斗争，这绝对办不到！
    毛主席教导我们：“人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。”现在是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，我们一定要照毛主席的指示办事。我们工人阶级一定要发扬无产阶级革命精神，以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
