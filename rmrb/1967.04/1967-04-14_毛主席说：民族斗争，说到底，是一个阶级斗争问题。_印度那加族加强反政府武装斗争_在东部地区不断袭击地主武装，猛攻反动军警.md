Chairman Mao says: National struggles, ultimately, are a class struggle issue.
The Naga people in India intensify armed struggle against the government
In the eastern region, they repeatedly attack landlord armed forces and launch fierce assaults on reactionary military and police.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 11th: New Delhi reports that since early April, the Naga people in eastern India have intensified their armed struggle against the Indian reactionary government, repeatedly striking back at the reactionary military and police.

According to Indian newspapers, about eighty Naga armed fighters on the 4th attacked a camp of the reactionary Manipur Rifles in a place in the Jiribam district. On the same day, in a place in Tamenglong, Naga armed fighters attacked a camp of the reactionary landlord armed "Village Volunteers."

On the 5th, more than two hundred Naga armed fighters, equipped with light machine guns and automatic weapons, attacked a camp of the "Village Volunteers" in Changchak and seized sixteen rifles and a large amount of ammunition. On the same night, another camp of the "Village Volunteers" in the Ukhrul district was also attacked.

On the morning of the 7th, a group of Naga armed fighters, equipped with light machine guns, ambushed a patrol of the Indian reactionary army, killing three and wounding two patrol members.

On the 8th, Naga armed fighters attacked a security force outpost and a patrol that arrived there in the Kromiya area between Assam and Nagaland. On the 9th, they launched a fierce assault on another security force in that area.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The Naga people's armed struggle against the Indian reactionary government is entirely a result of the Indian reactionary government's policy of genocide against the Naga people over the years. The Naga armed forces and the Mizo tribal armed forces support each other in their struggle against the Indian reactionary government. Their armed struggle threatens the rule of the Indian reactionary clique and has become a thorn in the side of the Indian reactionaries.

The Indian reactionary government has long adopted the dual tactics of armed suppression and political deception to try to extinguish the Naga armed struggle. Since 1964, it has used the so-called "negotiations" to delay time and tie up the hands of the Naga people in their armed resistance, attempting to stabilize the situation in the Naga region. But this plot is increasingly being exposed by the Naga people. According to a report from an Indian news agency, soon after the negotiations held last October, the forces within the Naga advocating armed struggle called for a halt to the talks. They pointed out that the Indian government deliberately prolonged the negotiations to gain time to strengthen the "security arrangements" to suppress the Naga people in Nagaland, and the Naga people must not fall for this.

In recent times, the Naga armed forces have intensified their armed struggle in the three regions of Assam, Nagaland, and Manipur.

    毛主席说：民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。
    印度那加族加强反政府武装斗争
    在东部地区不断袭击地主武装，猛攻反动军警
    据新华社十一日讯　新德里消息：四月初以来，印度东部地区的那加族人民加强了反抗印度反动政府的武装斗争，不断痛击反动政府的军警。
    据印度报纸报道，约八十名那加族武装人员四日在吉里巴姆大区一个地方袭击了反动的曼尼普尔步枪队的一个营房。同日，在塔门隆的一个地方，那加族武装袭击了反动地主武装“乡村志愿队”的一个营房。
    五日，配备有轻机枪和自动武器的二百多名那加族武装人员在尚查克袭击了“乡村志愿队”的一个营房并夺得了十六枝步枪和大量弹药。同日晚，在乌克鲁尔大区的另一个“乡村志愿队”的营房也遭到袭击。
    七日晨，一支配备有轻机枪的那加族武装人员伏击了印度反动军队的一支巡逻队，打死三名和打伤两名巡逻队队员。
    八日，那加族武装袭击了阿萨姆邦和那加邦之间的克罗米亚地方的一个保安部队岗哨和来到那里的一支巡逻队。九日，又对这个地方的一支保安部队发动猛攻。
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。那加族人民反抗印度反动政府的武装斗争，完全是印度反动政府多年来对那加族实施残酷的种族灭绝政策逼出来的。那加族武装和米佐部族武装在反对印度反动政府的斗争中相互支援，他们的武装斗争威胁着印度反动派的统治，成了印度反动派的心腹之患。
    印度反动政府一直采取武装镇压和政治诱骗的反革命两手，妄图扑灭那加族的武装斗争。从一九六四年以来，即以拖延时日的所谓“会谈”来束缚那加族人民进行武装反抗的手脚，企图稳住那加地区的局势。但这个阴谋日益被那加族人民所识破。据印度的一家通讯社报道，在去年十月的谈判举行后不久，那加族中主张坚持武装斗争的力量就要求停止谈判。他们指出，印度政府故意延长谈判，是为了争取时间来加强在那加邦镇压那加族人民的“保安安排”，对此，那加族人切不可上当。
    最近以来，那加族武装在阿萨姆邦、那加邦和曼尼普尔三个地区内加强了武装斗争。
