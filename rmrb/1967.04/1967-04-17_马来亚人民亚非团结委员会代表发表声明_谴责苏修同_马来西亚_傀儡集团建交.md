The Malayan People's Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee's representative in London, Karim, issued a statement in Algiers on April 14, condemning the Soviet modern revisionist leadership's establishment of diplomatic relations with the new colonialist tool, "Malaysia."

The statement pointed out that the Soviet revisionists and the "Malaysia" puppet regime's establishment of diplomatic relations this month further exposes the Soviet modern revisionist leadership's active collusion with American and British imperialists to oppose the Malayan national liberation movement. Their purpose is also to oppose the People's Republic of China and the national liberation movements in Southeast Asia.

The statement said, the "Malaysia" Rahman puppet regime has received military support from Britain, the United States, Australia, and other imperialist countries. This fake government is currently carrying out large-scale brutal suppression against the people of Malaya and North Borneo. With the active support of American and British imperialists and the Soviet modern revisionist leadership, the Rahman puppet regime will further expand its evil activities against the national liberation movements in Southeast Asia.

The statement pointed out that the Rahman puppet regime is closely colluding with the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime, the Thanom-Kittikachorn clique, the Chiang Kai-shek traitor, and the Park Chung-hee clique. This puppet regime is also helping to train the American imperialists' lackey Nguyen Cao Ky's pseudo-army to oppose the Vietnamese people. Therefore, the establishment of diplomatic relations with the "Malaysia" puppet regime fully proves that the Soviet modern revisionist leadership and American imperialism are the true enemies of the Vietnamese people.

    马来亚人民亚非团结委员会代表发表声明
    谴责苏修同“马来西亚”傀儡集团建交
    据新华社阿尔及尔十四日电　马来亚人民亚非团结委员会驻伦敦代表卡里姆十四日在阿尔及尔发表声明，谴责苏联现代修正主义领导集团同新殖民主义的工具“马来西亚”建立外交关系。
    声明指出，苏修和“马来西亚”傀儡集团于本月份建立外交关系这件事，进一步暴露了苏联现代修正主义领导集团积极同美英帝国主义者勾结，反对马来亚民族解放运动的罪恶行径。其目的也在于反对中华人民共和国以及东南亚的民族解放运动。
    声明说，“马来西亚”拉赫曼傀儡集团在军事上得到了英国、美国、澳大利亚和其他帝国主义国家的支持。这个伪政权目前正在对马来亚和北加里曼丹人民进行大规模的残酷镇压。拉赫曼傀儡政权在美英帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义领导集团的积极支持下，将进一步扩大它反对东南亚民族解放运动的罪恶活动。
    声明指出，拉赫曼傀儡政权同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权、他侬—巴博集团、蒋介石卖国贼和朴正熙集团密切勾结。这个傀儡政权还在帮助训练美帝国主义的走狗阮高其的伪军，以反对越南人民，因此，同“马来西亚”傀儡集团建立外交关系这件事，充分证明苏联现代修正主义领导集团和美帝国主义都是越南人民的真正敌人。
