Chairman Mao has always taught us: "If a person, a party, an army, or a school is not opposed by the enemy, then something is wrong. That would mean that we have gone over to the side of the enemy. If we are opposed by the enemy, then it is good. That proves that we have drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves."

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has faithfully carried out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, actively supported the revolutionary masses, firmly opposed the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and strongly defended the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country. This glorious task undertaken by our army has not only received the active support of the people of the entire country but has also won the enthusiastic praise of the revolutionary people of the world.

However, the Soviet revisionist leading clique has taken our Chinese People's Liberation Army as a thorn in their side. In their anti-China clamor against our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have shot arrow after arrow at our army. They slander our Cultural Revolution as "not relying on the Party" but "relying on the army," and even maliciously defame our army as "reimposing violence and suppression on the people of their own country." These despicable lies fully expose the Soviet revisionist leading clique as the sworn enemies of our people and fully prove the important role played by our People's Liberation Army in supporting the left, supporting industry, and supporting agriculture. This not only strikes at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within our Party but also gives a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist traitors.

Is our country's Cultural Revolution "not relying on the Party"? Everyone knows that this is a complete slander!

The first page of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" clearly states: "The core of our leadership is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." This is what our Red Guards, the revolutionary masses of our country, and all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army study, recite, and forever keep in mind every day.

From the very beginning, our country's Cultural Revolution has been carried out under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. This unprecedented Cultural Revolution is a new development of our Party's mass line in the new stage of socialist revolution. Through the Cultural Revolution, our Party has mobilized the masses of the people throughout the country to openly, thoroughly, and from the bottom up discuss, examine, and criticize the work of our Party committees and governments at all levels. This is the greatest democracy under the highest centralized leadership and is also the highest centralized leadership based on the greatest democracy. This is something that no bourgeois party or revisionist party can do or even imagine.

The Soviet revisionist leading clique turns a blind eye to such facts but attacks our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution for "not relying on the Party's leadership." We cannot help but ask: What kind of Party's "leadership" do you want us to rely on? Do you want us to "rely" on the "leadership" of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party? You are just dreaming. Not only will we not "rely" on them, but we will also expose them, criticize them thoroughly, and overthrow them completely. The countless facts of the more than ten months of the Cultural Revolution and the countless facts of the seventeen years of liberation of the entire country have already proven: If we "rely" on the "leadership" of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, our revolutionary masses will be suppressed, our Cultural Revolution will be aborted, our dictatorship of the proletariat will be destroyed, and our socialist mountains will change color.

Today, our people are holding high the revolutionary banner of criticism guided by Mao Zedong Thought, rising up to attack the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, precisely to uproot the revisionist roots in our country, prevent a capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration in our country, and ensure that our socialist revolution is carried through to the end. At this time, you, the Soviet revisionist overlords, jump out to ask the Chinese people to "rely" on those handful of revolutionary revisionist elements who are being overthrown by us. Isn't this too ridiculous, too absurd?

Our Chinese People's Liberation Army is a revolutionary army personally created and nurtured by Chairman Mao, a pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the strongest support for our revolutionary masses, and a staunch defender of our socialist motherland. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese Red Army is a armed group executing revolutionary political tasks." "To stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve them wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army."

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's instructions, fully supported the struggle for power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, resolutely smashed the counter-revolutionary tide of capitalist restoration, and ruthlessly suppressed the counter-revolutionary forces that disrupt the Cultural Revolution and production. We stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, united in struggle and victory together. The people of the entire country express their unlimited trust and enthusiastic support for us, regarding us as their strongest backing. This is the greatest glory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, the Soviet revisionist leading clique slanders our army for "imposing violence and suppression on the people of their own country," which, apart from proving that they are of the same ilk as the counter-revolutionary forces in our country, proves what else?

Marxism-Leninism tells us that in a class society, the army is a tool of class struggle. It either serves the proletariat or the exploiting class. Everyone knows that the Soviet revisionist leading clique has long turned the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and is hurriedly carrying out capitalist restoration at home. The Soviet revisionist leading clique slanders us for "suppressing" the people, but the ones who actually use the army to "reimpose violence and suppression on the people of their own country" are precisely they themselves.

It is not surprising that the Soviet revisionist leading clique harbors such deep hatred for the Chinese People's Liberation Army and engages in frenzied abuse. The enemy's abuse is our glory. For decades, our Chinese People's Liberation Army has grown and strengthened in the midst of the enemy's attacks and abuse. The "extermination" by the Kuomintang reactionaries did not destroy us, the aggression of American imperialism did not conquer us, and the abuse of Soviet modern revisionism will never intimidate us. We are the people's army personally commanded by Chairman Mao and armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. No force in the world can stop us from advancing to victory. The abuse of the Soviet revisionist leading clique can only make our military and civilians see more clearly their traitorous faces, arouse our class hatred more, and heighten our vigilance against domestic and foreign class enemies. The more frenziedly the enemy abuses us, the more it proves that we are right, and the more we must do so and do it better.

Now, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has reached a decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. The Soviet revisionist leading clique wants us to show mercy to the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Chinese Party so that he can lead us down the revisionist road in the future and follow the Soviet revisionist leading clique. We will never agree, we will never be fooled! We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line closely, together with the revolutionary masses of the entire country, pursue and attack China's Khrushchev relentlessly, and uproot the revisionist roots in our country thoroughly. In the victorious advance of the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries, let the handful of anti-China clowns of the Soviet revisionist leading clique cry!

    解放军是文化大革命的可靠保卫者
    解放军某部政治处主任　陈金元
    毛主席一贯教导我们：“一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。”
    我们中国人民解放军，在无产阶级文化大革命中，忠实地执行毛主席的革命路线，积极地支持无产阶级革命派，坚决地反对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，强有力地保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫我国的无产阶级专政。我军担负的这个光荣任务，不但受到了全国人民的积极支持，而且也获得了世界革命人民的热烈赞扬。
    但是，苏修领导集团却把我们中国人民解放军当成眼中钉。他们在攻击我国无产阶级文化大革命的一片反华叫嚣声中，向我军射出了一支又一支的毒箭。他们污蔑我国的文化大革命“不依靠党”“而依靠军队”，甚至恶毒地诽谤我军“对本国人民重新实行暴力和镇压”。这种卑劣谎言，充分暴露了苏修领导集团是我国人民的死敌，也充分证明了我人民解放军在支左、支工、支农中所起的重要作用，这不但打击了我国党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，而且也是对苏修叛徒们的狠狠的一掌。
    我国文化大革命是“不依靠党”的领导吗？谁都知道，这是彻头彻尾的诽谤！
    《毛主席语录》的第一页第一条，就明明白白地写着：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”这是我们的红卫兵小将，我国广大革命群众和我们人民解放军全体指战员天天学，天天念，并且永远铭记在心里的毛主席教导。
    我国的文化大革命，从一开始，就是在以毛主席为首的党中央领导下进行的。这场史无前例的文化大革命，是我们党的群众路线在社会主义革命新阶段的新发展。通过文化大革命，我们党放手发动全国人民群众公开地、全面地、自下而上地对我们各级党委和政府的各方面的工作，进行了彻底的讨论、审查和批评。这是在最高集中指导下的最大民主，也是在最大民主基础上的最高集中。这是任何资产阶级政党和修正主义政党所根本办不到也不可能想象的事情。
    苏修领导集团闭眼不看这样的事实，却攻击我国的无产阶级文化大革命“不依靠党”的领导。我们不禁要反问一声：你们究竟要我们依靠什么样的党的“领导”？你们想让我们“依靠”党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的“领导”吗？那你们不过是在白日作梦。我们不但不会“依靠”他们，而且要把他们揪出来，让全国革命群众对他们进行彻底的揭露，彻底的批判，把他们彻底打倒。文化大革命十个多月来的无数事实，全国解放十七年来的无数事实早已证明：要是我们“依靠”了党内这一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的“领导”，我们的革命群众就会遭到镇压，我们的文化大革命就会夭折，我们的无产阶级专政就会葬送，我们的社会主义江山就会变色。
    今天，我国人民高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派群起而攻之，正是为了挖掉在我国的修正主义根子，防止在我国实现资本主义的反革命复辟，保证把我国的社会主义革命进行到底。在这个时候，你们这些苏修老爷们却跳出来要中国人民去“依靠”那些正在被我们打倒的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，这岂不是太可笑，太荒唐了吗？
    我们中国人民解放军是毛主席亲自缔造和培育的革命军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石，是我国革命群众最强大的后盾，是社会主义祖国的坚强保卫者。毛主席教导我们：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”。“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们坚决执行毛主席的指示，全力支持无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，坚决打垮资本主义反革命复辟的逆流，无情镇压破坏文化大革命和破坏生产的反革命势力。我们同革命群众和革命干部肩并肩，心连心，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。全国人民对我们表示无限的信赖和热烈的拥护，把我们当作自己最强有力的靠山。这是我们中国人民解放军的无比光荣。但是，苏修领导集团却颠倒黑白地诬蔑我军对本国人民“实行暴力和镇压”，这除了证明他们同我国的反革命势力是一丘之貉以外，还能证明什么呢？
    马克思列宁主义的理论告诉我们，在阶级社会中，军队是阶级斗争的工具，它不是为无产阶级服务，就是为剥削阶级服务。谁都知道，苏修领导集团早就把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政，在国内加紧实行资本主义复辟。苏修领导集团诬蔑我们“镇压”人民，其实利用军队来“对本国人民重新实行暴力和镇压”的，恰恰是他们自己。
    苏修领导集团对中国人民解放军这样怀有刻骨的仇恨，进行疯狂的咒骂，是毫不奇怪的。敌人的咒骂，正是我们的光荣。几十年来，我们中国人民解放军就是在敌人的攻击中、咒骂中成长壮大起来的。国民党反动派的“围剿”没有能够消灭我们，美帝国主义的侵略没有能够征服我们，苏联现代修正主义的咒骂也决不能吓倒我们。我们是毛主席亲自统帅的、用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队，世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡我们胜利地前进。苏修领导集团的咒骂，只能使我国军民更加认清他们的叛徒嘴脸，更加激发我们的阶级仇恨，更加提高我们对于国内外阶级敌人的警惕。敌人越是疯狂咒骂，就越证明我们做得对，我们就越要这样做，做得更好。
    现在，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经到了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战关头。苏修领导集团妄想我们对中国党内头号走资本主义道路当权派手下留情，以便让他将来把我们中国引上修正主义的道路，跟着苏修领导集团走。我们决不答应，决不上当！我们一定要紧紧地跟随毛主席的革命路线，同全国革命群众在一起，对中国的赫鲁晓夫进行穷追猛打，彻底挖掉我国的修正主义根子。在中国无产阶级革命派的胜利进军号声中，让苏修领导集团的一小撮反华小丑们去哭泣吧！
