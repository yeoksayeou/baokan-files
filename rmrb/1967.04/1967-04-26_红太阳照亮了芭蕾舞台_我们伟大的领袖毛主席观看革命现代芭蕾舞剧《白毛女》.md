On the evening of April 24, the revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl," created by the revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School, was performing in the capital of our great motherland, the birthplace of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

When the performance reached the final two scenes, and the oppressed Jieyi finally gained liberation as a red sun rose, a passionate and stirring song echoed through the theater, shaking the earth and stirring the heart:

"The sun has risen,
The sun has risen,
The sun's rays are brilliant....
The sun is Mao Zedong!
The sun is the Communist Party!"

Since its premiere over a hundred times, the ballet "White-Haired Girl" has never danced with such vigor, never sung with such fervor, and never had the sun shine so brightly!

Today, our most beloved great leader, the red sun in the hearts of all the revolutionary people of China and the world, Chairman Mao, came to watch the performance of the ballet "White-Haired Girl" amidst the triumphant songs of the proletarian revolutionary line led by him and the great revolutionary situation of denouncing the capitalist-roaders within the Party. For many days, whenever the teachers and students heard the enthusiastic praise from workers, peasants, and soldiers after the performance, they strongly felt: only by truly following Chairman Mao's teachings can we truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers; only Chairman Mao truly understands the love of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This ballet was born under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. Chairman Mao! When will you come to see our performance and give us more guidance and instructions?... Now, this wish has finally come true!

At 7:53 PM, Chairman Mao, with a radiant face and full of vigor, entered the theater with his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai, among others. In an instant, he, like a red sun, illuminated the entire ballet stage and shone upon the more than a hundred pioneers of the ballet art revolution on the stage, behind the stage, and in the orchestra pit. At this most precious and unforgettable moment, the performers, with their hearts pounding, played the most resounding song for the great leader—"The East Is Red"!

The curtain rose, and the singing began. The great helmsman Chairman Mao started to review this grand revolutionary modern ballet, born under his revolutionary literary and artistic line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao carefully watched the performance on stage, sometimes exchanging light and affectionate words with Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai. After each act, he applauded warmly.

After the performance, Chairman Mao, amidst the music of "The Boat Sails on the Sea Relying on the Helmsman" and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!", ascended the stage with Comrade Lin Biao to meet the revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School and other performing artists who participated in the performance.

At this moment, all the performers and staff, like sunflowers turning towards the sun, gathered closely around Chairman Mao. They transformed their surging revolutionary passion and their sincere feelings of boundless admiration and respect for the great leader into the loudest praises, shouting over and over again: "Chairman Mao! The red sun in our hearts! We wish you eternal life!"

Chairman Mao walked into the ranks of the performers and shook hands with them. Then, it was time for a group photo, but it was too difficult to calm everyone down. Everyone gazed at Chairman Mao with affectionate eyes. The performers in front clapped their hands excitedly in rhythm with Chairman Mao's applause, while those in the back raised their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The alert photographer captured this most moving scene.

Our most beloved great leader, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, waved goodbye to the performers and, with a powerful stride, walked off the stage and left the theater.

Chairman Mao has not left! Chairman Mao will always be with us! At this moment, the performers were completely immersed in the warmth of happiness.

"Did you see? Chairman Mao nodded and smiled at us!"
"Quick, shake my hand! My hand has shaken Chairman Mao's!"
"Come here, everyone! This is where Chairman Mao stood!"
"Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"
"The boat sails on the sea relying on the helmsman, all things grow relying on the sun..."

This was an extraordinary night! A night of excitement! A night of happiness! A night to remember!

Some people opened their diaries and wrote down this most important moment of their lives word by word. Some people picked up the phone and, with excited voices, reported the good news to comrades far away. Some people took up their pens to share this greatest happiness with their distant relatives who longed for Chairman Mao day and night.

But on this night of joy, more performers were reviewing Chairman Mao's great teachings:

"Our literature and art are for the people. They are first for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and for the workers, peasants, and soldiers to use."

"To make literature and art a good component of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, to help the people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind."

These important instructions given by Chairman Mao in his brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" have been twenty-five years. The revolution is advancing, history is leaping forward, and in the past twenty-five years, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved one victory after another. At this moment, when Chairman Mao is watching the revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl," the revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School excitedly recall that every step in the development of our proletarian revolutionary literature and art, and the rebirth of our ballet art on the road of revolutionization, nationalization, and popularization, is due to Chairman Mao's personal guidance. Not a single step, not a single point, is not derived from the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought!

They will never forget how Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xian Yan, and other counter-revolutionary revisionists, with the support of the capitalist-roader in command within the Party, dominated the stage, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. The capitalist-roader in command within the Party blatantly opposed Chairman Mao's principle of "ancient for modern use, foreign for Chinese use," saying: "Reflecting modern life cannot be forced; ballet and foreign opera do not necessarily reflect it." Under the control of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line with him as the backer, the young teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School, who had just entered the literary and artistic circle, were once forced to learn those old ballets like "Swan Lake" that poisoned the souls of the revolutionary people. It was at this critical moment that Chairman Mao issued two instructions on literary and artistic work, striking a heavy blow at the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line backed by the capitalist-roader in command within the Party.

Following the instruction in December 1963, in June 1964, Chairman Mao again pointed out during the rectification of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and its affiliated associations: These associations and the publications they control (it is said that there are a few good ones) have basically (not everyone) not implemented the Party's policies for fifteen years, acting as officials and lords, not approaching the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and not reflecting the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, they have even slipped to the brink of revisionism. If they are not seriously reformed, they will inevitably become organizations like the Petofi Club in Hungary on some future day.

From then on, the revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line and with the care and support of Comrade Jiang Qing, fought resolutely against the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line. They established something new for socialism and something different for the proletariat, finally successfully creating another model revolutionary ballet after "The Red Detachment of Women"—"White-Haired Girl." The birth of this artistic gem, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, is a new victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line and a heavy blow to the revisionist literary and artistic line pushed by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists backed by the capitalist-roader in command within the Party!

Now, amidst the triumphant songs of the proletarian revolutionary line led by Chairman Mao and the great revolutionary situation of criticizing the capitalist-roaders within the Party, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao watched the grand revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl," born under the great thought of Chairman Mao. How could the revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School not shout with joy, not sing with joy, not be full of fighting spirit!

Dawn has come. A new day begins with the rising sun in the east. At this moment, they faced the red sun in the east, expressing their revolutionary resolve to the great leader Chairman Mao time and time again: Always be loyal to Chairman Mao, always be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the capitalist-roader in command within the Party! Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, reform our thoughts for life, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life!

    红太阳照亮了芭蕾舞台
    ——我们伟大的领袖毛主席观看革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》
    四月二十四日晚上，由上海市舞蹈学校革命师生创作的大型革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，正在无产阶级文化大革命的策源地——我们伟大祖国的首都进行演出。
    演出到最后两场，当惨遭地主阶级迫害的喜儿终于获得解放，一轮红日冉冉升起的时候，一曲激情奔放的伴歌，动地而来，震人心弦：
    “太阳出来了，
    太阳出来了，
    太阳光芒万丈，……
    太阳就是毛泽东！
    太阳就是共产党！”
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》上演一百多场以来，舞姿从来没有象今天这样奔放，歌声从来没有象今天这样激扬，太阳从来没有象今天这样明亮！
    今天，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖、全中国和全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，在以他老人家为代表的无产阶级革命路线节节胜利的凯歌声中，在举国声讨党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大好革命形势下，前来观看芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的演出了！
    多少天来，每当师生们在演出后听到工农兵的大力赞美时，就强烈地意识到：只有真正按照毛主席的教导，才能真正为工农兵服务；只有毛主席才最最懂得工农兵的喜爱。这个舞剧就是在毛主席文艺路线指引下诞生的。毛主席啊！什么时候，什么时候您能来看一看我们的演出，给我们更多的教导和指示呀！……现在，这个愿望终于实现了！
    晚上七时五十三分，毛主席满面红光，神采奕奕，和他的亲密战友林彪同志以及周恩来同志等，走入剧场。刹那间，他老人家象一轮红日，照亮了整个芭蕾舞台，照耀着舞台上、舞台后、乐池里一百多位投入芭蕾舞艺术革命的闯将。在这最最珍贵难忘的时刻，演奏员按住剧烈跳动的心，为伟大的领袖奏起最响亮的歌曲——《东方红》！
    帷幕升，歌声起，伟大的统帅毛主席开始检阅这出在他老人家的革命文艺路线指引下、在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的大型革命现代芭蕾舞剧。毛主席仔细地观看舞台上的表演，有时和林彪同志、周恩来同志轻轻地亲切交谈，每一幕结束时，都热烈鼓掌。
    演出结束后，毛主席在《大海航行靠舵手》的乐曲声中和“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声中，同林彪同志登上舞台，接见上海市舞蹈学校的革命师生和参加演出的其他文艺工作者。
    这时，所有演员和工作人员，象朵朵葵花向太阳似地，紧紧围拢在毛主席身旁。他们把沸腾澎湃的革命激情，把对伟大领袖无限崇拜、无限敬仰的真挚感情，化成最响亮的颂辞，一遍遍高呼：“毛主席！我们心中最红最红的红太阳！我们祝您万寿无疆！”
    毛主席走到演员队伍中，和演员们紧紧握手。接着，要合影了，但是，让大家安静下来是太困难了。每一个人都用深情的目光注视着毛主席。前面的演员合着毛主席的鼓掌的节拍兴奋地拍手，后面的同志高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》热情高呼“毛主席万岁！”机灵的摄影记者就把这最最激动人心的场面摄进了镜头。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，和演员们挥手告别以后，迈着雄劲的步伐，走下了舞台，离开了剧场。
    毛主席没有走！毛主席永远和我们在一起！这时候演员们完全沉醉在幸福的暖流之中。
    “你们看到了没有，毛主席向我们点头微笑了啊！”
    “快来握我的手啊，我的手是和毛主席握过的啊！”
    “大家快来啊，这是毛主席站过的地方啊！”
    “毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    “大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，……”
    这是一个不平常的夜晚！沸腾的夜晚！幸福的夜晚！难忘的夜晚！
    有的人摊开日记本，一字一句地记下这有生以来最最重要的时刻。有的人拿起电话机，用激动的声调向千里迢迢的战友报告喜讯。有的人提笔写信，为的是和日夜思念毛主席的远方亲人分享这最大的幸福。
    但是，在这欢腾的夜晚，更多的演员是在重温毛主席的伟大教导：
    “我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”
    “要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”
    毛主席在他的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中发出的这些重要指示，到现在已经二十五年了。革命在前进，历史在飞跃，二十五年来，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得了一个又一个胜利。此刻，当毛主席观看革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的时候，上海市舞蹈学校的革命师生们激动地回顾，我国无产阶级革命文艺的发展，我们芭蕾艺术在革命化、民族化、群众化道路上的新生，有哪一项不是由于毛主席他老人家的亲切教导，有哪一点不是来源于光焰无际的毛泽东思想！
    他们永远不会忘记，陆定一、周扬、夏衍等反革命修正主义分子在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派支持下，统治戏剧舞台，为资本主义复辟制造舆论的滔天罪行。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，明目张胆地反对毛主席提出的“古为今用”、“外为中用”的原则，胡说什么：“反映现代生活不能勉强，芭蕾舞，外国歌剧不一定能反映。”在以他为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺路线的控制下，刚刚踏进文艺界的上海市舞蹈学校的年轻的师生们，一度被迫不得不去学习那些《天鹅湖》之类的毒害革命人民灵魂的旧芭蕾舞剧。就是在这个严重关头，毛主席两次发出了关于文艺工作的指示，狠狠地打击了以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺路线。
    继一九六三年十二月的指示以后，一九六四年六月，毛主席又在全国文联和所属各协会整风时指出：这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数（据说有少数几个好的），十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。
    从此以后，上海市舞蹈学校的革命师生，在毛主席无产阶级文艺路线的指引下，在江青同志的关怀和支持下，向反革命修正主义文艺路线进行了坚决斗争。他们标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，终于创作成功了继《红色娘子军》之后又一个革命芭蕾舞剧的好样板——《白毛女》。这颗闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的艺术明珠的问世，是毛主席革命文艺路线的新胜利，也是对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派支持下的一小撮反革命修正主义分子推行的修正主义文艺路线的沉重打击！
    现在，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线节节胜利的凯歌声中，在亿万革命人民奋起批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大好革命形势下，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席观看了在他老人家伟大思想照耀下诞生的大型革命现代舞剧《白毛女》，上海市舞蹈学校的革命师生们，怎么能不欢呼跳跃，怎么能不纵情歌唱，怎么能不斗志昂扬！
    黎明来到了。一轮喷薄欲出的旭日又宣告了新的一天的开始。这时，他们迎着东方的红太阳，向着伟大领袖毛主席，一次又一次地表示自己的革命决心：永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派！坚决执行毛主席的文艺路线，彻底批判反革命修正主义文艺黑线，一辈子改造思想，一辈子为工农兵服务！
