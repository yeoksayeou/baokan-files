	Respected Comrade Xie Fuzhi, Respected Comrades:

	I represent my comrades and the patriotic Indonesians abroad to speak. I can say that what I say here to all the comrades present and to the whole world is the sentiment and will of the 100 million people of Indonesia.

	In Indonesia, the fascist military regime led by Suharto-Nasution is in power, and it has carried out bloody suppression against the Indonesian people. It is this regime that has incited extremely barbaric anti-Chinese activities and racial discrimination against the Chinese.

	The Indonesian people curse and resist the fascist ruling clique in Indonesia for the savage racist acts committed by the thugs against our Chinese comrades in Jakarta and other regions.

	The self-defense actions of the Chinese comrades in Surabaya, Jakarta, and other regions are correct and just. They have greatly inspired the struggle of the Indonesian people.

	Comrades, the Indonesian people and patriotic Indonesians not only hate and curse the fascist military regime in Indonesia and their fascist actions, but the Indonesian people also have the responsibility to take Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon and resolutely overthrow this regime. This is not only our responsibility but also in line with the laws of historical development. No force can stop the emergence and growth of the people's struggle. This struggle will definitely overthrow the fascist regime.

	Fascism goes against the historical trend. The Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime is also like this. They oppose the people, oppose democracy, and oppose progress. Therefore, they will inevitably face resistance and will inevitably collapse.

	Now, the Indonesian people have found the way to smash this fascist clique, which is the path of people's war, Mao Zedong's path.

	We express our deepest gratitude to the progressive forces of the world, especially to the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, for their fraternal sympathy and support. Now, to ensure that China remains forever red and that the great socialist China remains forever the center of the world revolutionary movement and the strongest fortress against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant results in their struggle.

	The condemnation of the Indonesian fascist military regime by the progressive people of the world will accelerate its downfall. This will also accelerate the collapse of the imperialist forces in one link in Asia.

	Comrades, we should expose the various crimes of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime. This regime should be held responsible for the racist terrorist acts against our Chinese comrades. We should expose their evil deeds and treacherous actions. We do this not only for the struggle of the Indonesian people and the Chinese comrades but also for the struggle of the people of the world, the people of Asia, and especially the people of Vietnam.

	This fascist military regime, with the support of the imperialists led by the United States, has usurped the power of the Republic of Indonesia.

	Comrades, to achieve the above-mentioned evil purposes, the Indonesian fascist military regime has carried out extremely brutal suppression against the Indonesian people, whether they are Communist Party members or non-Communist Party members, men or women, adults or youths. Their brutality is no less than that of Hitler, who is cursed by the whole world. They have massacred hundreds of thousands of people. They have imprisoned hundreds of thousands of people. They are also hunting down people everywhere. At the same time, they are carrying out terrorist acts against our Chinese comrades.

	At present, this small clique of ruling fascist generals has already pawned our country to American imperialism.

	They have pawned all the rich natural resources of Indonesia to imperialism, to international monopoly capital, especially the monopoly capital that is entrenched in the United States. To plunder the wealth of Indonesia, they also plot to make the Indonesian people, workers, peasants, intellectuals, etc., into the cheap labor reserve army of imperialism. While the Suharto-Nasution regime acts as their watchdog.

	The treacherous actions of the Indonesian fascist military regime are certainly not limited to this. Under the orders of their American imperialist masters, they have incorporated our rich, populous, and strategically located homeland into the global strategy of imperialism led by the United States. Everyone knows that their main target is aimed at the strongest fortress of anti-imperialist struggle in the world—China. This is their purpose. The policy of the Indonesian fascist regime is to serve imperialism and oppose China.

	This is why the Indonesian fascist military regime incites racism. Their target is our Chinese comrades. Many Indonesian citizens of Chinese descent have also been subjected to their terrorist suppression.

	Chinese comrades or Indonesian citizens of Chinese descent have generally lived in harmony with the Indonesian people for decades or even centuries. Yet, they are now the targets of the terrorist actions of the thugs organized by the Indonesian fascist regime.

	The burning, killing, beating, smashing, and looting of the Chinese comrades by the Indonesian fascist regime have been severely condemned and hated by the Indonesian people. Not only that, the Indonesian fascist military regime has also trampled on all diplomatic relations.

	We all know that fascism, to divert the anger of the people, incites racism. This is their most barbaric and despicable method, just like Hitler in the past. In Indonesia, the racism incited by the fascist regime is to divert the anger of the Indonesian people, to divert the attention of the Indonesian people from the increasingly serious difficulties and contradictions. They find scapegoats, provoke China, and completely serve imperialism.

	Comrades, our conclusion is:

	The Indonesian fascist military regime has already pawned our country to imperialism. They have not only betrayed the Indonesian people but also betrayed the anti-imperialist people of the world.

	They have incorporated Indonesia into the ranks of the United States' global strategy in Asia. In doing so, they have not only betrayed the Indonesian people but also betrayed the people of Asia, Africa, and other regions. They have become tools of anti-China actions.

	They carry out terrorist policies against the Indonesian people and also carry out terrorist policies against the Chinese and Indonesian citizens of Chinese descent.

	They act as imperialist running dogs, hostile to the people. Yet, the Soviet modern revisionist clique aids this enemy of the people. The Soviet modern revisionist clique not only continuously provides economic and military aid to the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime but also actively spreads their modern revisionist ideas, splitting the Indonesian revolutionary forces. The Soviet modern revisionist clique deserves to die a thousand deaths!

	The mad actions of the Indonesian fascist clique will inevitably face increasingly widespread resistance. This is the inevitable result of their oppression and betrayal of the people. Therefore, the Indonesian fascist regime is unstable in all aspects such as economy, politics, and social order. All these will inevitably influence each other, inevitably leading to the continuous resistance of the people. The people's resistance struggle will inevitably grow and strengthen.

	Comrades, a thousand imperialisms and a thousand modern revisionisms will never be able to stop the downfall of the Suharto-Nasution fascist ruling regime. The Indonesian people and the Chinese will unite as one to resist the persecution of the Indonesian fascist military regime. Like the people of many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the Indonesian people have stood up. They rise up against imperialism and its running dogs and will definitely drive them out of Indonesian soil.

	Smash the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime!

	Long live the anti-imperialist and anti-fascist fighting unity!

	Long live the fighting unity of the Indonesian people and the Chinese people!

	Long live Chairman Mao, the savior of the world's people, and Mao Zedong Thought! Long live! Ten thousand years!

    查禾多在首都各界革命群众声讨印尼反动派反华排华罪行大会上讲话
    印尼人民决心用毛泽东思想为武器推翻法西斯政权  华侨同志的正义自卫行动大大鼓舞印尼人民的斗争尊敬的谢富治同志，尊敬的同志们：
    我代表我的同志们，在国外的印尼爱国者们讲话。我可以这样说，我在这里向到会的全体同志们、向全世界讲的话，就是印尼一亿人民的感情和意志。
    在印尼，由苏哈托—纳苏蒂安领导的法西斯军人政权正在统治着，它对印尼人民实行了血腥的镇压。就是这个政权煽起了非常野蛮的反华活动和排华的种族主义。
    印尼人民咒骂和反抗印尼法西斯统治集团在雅加达和其他地区发动的匪徒对华侨同志们所进行的种族主义的野蛮行为。
    西都文罗、雅加达和其他地区的华侨同志们进行的自卫行动是正确的、正义的。它大大地鼓舞了印尼人民的斗争。
    同志们，印尼人民和印尼爱国者，不但痛恨和咒骂印尼法西斯军人政权和他们的法西斯行为，印尼人民也有责任以毛泽东思想作为武器，下定决心推翻这个政权。这不但是我们的责任，也是符合历史发展规律的。没有任何力量能够阻止人民斗争的产生和壮大。这个斗争最后一定将推翻法西斯政权。
    法西斯主义违反了历史潮流。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权也是这样。他们反对人民，反对民主，反对进步。这样，他们遭到反抗，就必然会垮台。
    现在，印尼人民已经找到了怎样砸烂这个法西斯集团的道路，这就是人民战争的道路，毛泽东的道路。
    我们向全世界进步力量，特别是向毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民，表示最大的感谢。感谢他们给予我们兄弟般的同情和支持。现在，为了保证中国永远红彤彤、保证伟大的社会主义中国永远成为世界革命运动的中心，永远成为世界反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和各国反动派最强大的堡垒，中国人民在斗争中已经取得了辉煌的成绩。
    全世界进步人民对印尼法西斯军人政权的谴责将加速它的垮台。这样也将加速帝国主义力量在亚洲的一个环节的崩溃。
    同志们，我们应该揭露苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的种种罪行。这个政权应该对向华侨同志们实行种族主义恐怖行为负责，我们应该揭露他们的罪恶行为和叛变行为。我们这样做，不但是为了印尼人民和华侨的斗争，也是为了世界人民，亚洲人民，特别是越南人民的斗争。
    这个法西斯军人政权在以美帝为首的帝国主义支持下篡夺了印尼共和国政权。
    同志们，印尼法西斯军人政权为了实现上述罪恶目的，对印尼人民，共产党员或非共产党员，男人或女人，成年或青年，进行了极其残酷的镇压。其残酷程度不下于全世界所咒骂的希特勒的残酷。他们屠杀了几十万人。他们把几十万人关在牢狱里。他们还到处进行追捕。与此同时，他们对华侨同志们实行恐怖行为。
    目前这一小撮当权的法西斯将军已经把我们的国家典当给美国帝国主义。
    他们把印尼非常富饶的自然资源全部典当给帝国主义，典当给国际垄断资本，特别是那些盘踞在美国的垄断资本。为了掠夺印尼的财富，他们还阴谋把印尼人民，工人、农民、知识分子等作为帝国主义廉价的苦力后备军。而苏哈托—纳苏蒂安政权却充当他们的看门狗。
    印尼法西斯军人政权的叛变行为当然不止这些。在他们的主子美帝国主义指使下，他们把我们富饶的、人口众多的、处于战略地位的祖国纳入以美国为首的帝国主义全球战略范围。大家知道，他们的主要目标就是对准这个世界上最坚强的反帝斗争堡垒——中国。这就是他们的目的。印尼法西斯政权的政策就是为帝国主义效劳，反对中国。
    这就是为什么印尼法西斯军人政权要煽动种族主义。他们的目标就是华侨同志们。还有很多华裔印尼公民也遭到他们的恐怖镇压。
    华侨同志们或者华裔印尼公民一般都和印尼人民友好相处了几十年或几百年。可是，他们现在却成为印尼法西斯政权组织的匪徒的恐怖行动的对象。
    印尼法西斯政权对华侨同志们所进行的烧、杀、打、砸、抢，受到印尼人民的严厉谴责和痛恨。不仅如此，印尼法西斯军人政权还践踏了一切外交关系准则。
    我们大家知道，法西斯主义为了转移人民的愤怒目标，他们煽起种族主义。这是他们一贯采用的，最野蛮、最卑贱的手段。这和过去的希特勒是一模一样的。在印度尼西亚，法西斯政权煽起的种族主义，就是为了转移印尼人民的愤怒目标，转移印尼人民对日益加剧的困难和矛盾的注意力。他们找替罪羊，向中国进行挑衅，完全为帝国主义效劳。
    同志们，我们的结论是：
    印尼法西斯军人政权已经把我们的国家典当给帝国主义。他们不但背叛了印尼人民，也背叛了全世界反帝的人民。
    他们把印度尼西亚纳入美国全球战略在亚洲的行列。他们这样做，不但背叛了印度尼西亚人民，也背叛了亚洲、非洲等地区的人民。他们充当了反华的工具。
    他们对印尼人民实行恐怖政策，也对华侨和华裔印尼公民实行恐怖政策。
    他们充当帝国主义走狗，敌视人民。可是，苏联现代修正主义集团却援助这个人民的敌人。苏联现代修正主义集团不但向苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权不断提供经济和军事援助，而且也积极地散布他们的现代修正主义思想，分裂印尼革命队伍。苏联现代修正主义集团罪该万死！
    印尼法西斯集团这种疯狂的行径，必然会遭到日益广泛的反抗。这是他们压迫和背叛人民的必然结果。因此，印尼法西斯政权，在经济、政治、社会治安等各个方面是不可能稳定的。这一切势必互相影响，势必引起人民的不断反抗。人民的反抗斗争势必不断发展壮大。
    同志们，一千个帝国主义和一千个现代修正主义也绝不能阻止苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯统治政权的垮台。印尼人民和华侨必将团结一致，共同反抗印尼法西斯军人政权的迫害。同亚非拉很多国家的人民一样，印尼人民已经站起来了，他们起来反对帝国主义及其走狗，而且必将把他们从印尼大地上清除出去。
    砸烂苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权！
    反帝反法西斯的战斗团结万岁！
    印尼人民和中国人民的战斗团结万岁！
    全世界人民的救星毛主席、毛泽东思想万岁！万岁！万万岁！
