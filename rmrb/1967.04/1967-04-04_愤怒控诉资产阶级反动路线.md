After reading the article by the editorial board of the *Red Flag* magazine, "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Cadres Issue Must Be Criticized," I was deeply moved. As a revolutionary cadre who has been struck and persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line, I wholeheartedly cheer the new victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It is Chairman Mao's revolutionary line that has liberated me from the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The editorial board of *Red Flag* points out: "To strike down a large group and protect a small clique" is a component of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Last June, under the personal initiation and leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, our school, like the rest of the country, quickly launched a high tide of the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students took up the mighty weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and directed their spears at the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. The general direction of the revolutionary masses was completely correct. Under Chairman Mao's call and with the help and encouragement of the revolutionary masses, I quickly stood up and exposed the various crimes of the handful of power-holders within our Party who were taking the capitalist road during the Four Clean-ups and the Cultural Revolution. I, together with my classmates, resolved to fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them until they are thoroughly discredited. As the editorial board of *Red Flag* points out:

"The handful of power-holders within the Party, big and small, who are taking the capitalist road, fear the revolutionary masses the most, fear the revolutionary cadres the most, and especially fear the revolutionary cadres uniting with the revolutionary masses." They were terrified and enraged by my revolutionary actions and immediately launched multiple struggles against me, labeling me as a "counter-revolutionary," "traitor," "ambitious schemer," and "bad element," etc. They slandered me, saying that my exposure of the bad elements within the Party Committee "revealed the Party's top secrets." They used their organizational discipline to restrict me, forbidding me from exposing problems, and even spreading rumors that my Party branch was "rotten" (at that time, I was a member of the Party branch committee). They attempted to bring us all down. Particularly vicious was their abuse of organizational power, publicly announcing: to stop all my Party and non-Party duties; to have XX compile materials on my "counter-revolutionary actions" from June 1st to 4th; for all branch committees to convey this matter to all Party members. Thus, under the blows of the bourgeois reactionary line, I lost my revolutionary rights and was forced into a labor reform team. After the work team that implemented the bourgeois reactionary line entered the school, although I wrote to them several times and requested meetings, they not only ignored me but also slandered me, saying that I was in cahoots with the power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road.

In August, the revolutionary mass organization "Jinggangshan," which implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, finally broke through the heavy encirclement of the bourgeois reactionary line and was born. The revolutionary youngsters liberated me from the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line. I deeply understand that although some youngsters had posted big-character posters against me and struggled against me in the past, they did so out of high revolutionary vigilance. The revolutionary actions of the revolutionary masses should not only not be criticized but are very good. All evil should be attributed to the bourgeois reactionary line.

Today, when the light of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line shines upon us revolutionary cadres who have been persecuted, I cannot help but shout: Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! I will bravely stand up, firmly support the revolutionary masses, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, concentrate on exposing and striking down the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and wholeheartedly throw myself into this fiery struggle.

    愤怒控诉资产阶级反动路线
    北京师范大学前武装部副部长　李坤德
    读了《红旗》杂志评论员文章《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》以后，非常激动。作为一个曾受资产阶级反动路线打击、迫害的革命干部，我从心眼里欢呼毛主席的革命路线的新胜利。是毛主席的革命路线把我从资产阶级反动路线的迫害之下解放出来了。
    《红旗》评论员文章指出：“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分。
    去年六月初，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲自发动和领导下，我校和全国一样迅速掀起了文化大革命的高潮，革命师生奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把矛头对准了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。革命群众的大方向是完全正确的。在毛主席的号召下，在革命群众的帮助和推动之下，我很快站出来，揭发了我校党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在四清运动和文化大革命中的种种罪行，并和同学们一起决心把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。正如《红旗》评论员文章指出的：
    “党内一小撮走资本主义道路的大大小小的当权派，最害怕革命群众，最害怕革命干部，特别最害怕革命干部同革命群众相结合。”对于我的这一革命行动，他们吓得要死，恨得要命，立即对我进行多次斗争，把我打成“反革命”，“叛徒”，“小野心家”，“坏分子”等等，他们诬蔑我揭发党委内的坏人“是暴露了党的绝密”。他们利用他们那套组织纪律来限制我，不准我揭发问题，甚至散布流言蜚语，说我所在的党支部“烂了”（当时我是党支部委员），企图把我们全部打倒。特别恶毒的是他们滥用组织权力，公开宣布：停止我的党内外一切职务；由××整理我六月一日到四日的“反革命行动”的材料；各总支向全体党员传达这件事。就这样，我在资产阶级反动路线的打击下，失去了革命的权利，还把我拉到劳改队强迫劳动。推行资产阶级反动路线的工作组进校后，虽然我几次给他们写信，约他们谈话，他们不仅不理睬，而且污蔑我和党内走资本主义道路的当权派一个鼻孔出气。
    八月份，我校执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的革命群众组织“井冈山”，终于冲破资产阶级反动路线的重重包围诞生了，革命的小将把我从资产阶级反动路线的桎梏中解放出来。我深深地懂得，过去虽然有些小将贴过我的大字报，斗争过我，他们完全出于高度的革命警惕性。革命群众的革命行动不但不应受到指责，而且是好得很。一切罪恶都只能归于资产阶级反动路线。
    今天，当毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的光辉照亮了我们受迫害的革命干部的时候，我禁不住高呼：毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！毛主席万岁！万万岁！我要勇敢地站出来，坚决支持革命群众，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，集中揭露和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，全身心地投入这个火热的斗争中去。
