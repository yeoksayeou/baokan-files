Youth in Ecuador's largest city, Guayaquil, recently held an anti-U.S. imperialism demonstration and attacked the U.S. Consulate.

This demonstration was held to commemorate the first anniversary of the overthrow of the former pro-U.S. military dictatorship by the Ecuadorian people. The military dictatorship was installed in July 1963 with the backing of the United States. Since then, the Ecuadorian people have been waging a heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism and the dictatorship. On March 29 of last year, under the strong pressure of the people's anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorship struggle, this dictatorship collapsed.

The procession of Guayaquil youth chanted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" along the way. The students held a rally in the city's central square and then marched towards the U.S. Consulate. Along the way, they bravely fought with police armed with machetes and tear gas. Finally, the students broke through the heavy police cordon and reached the U.S. Consulate, smashing some of its windows with stones. The students' demonstration was supported by several trade unions in the city.

On the same day, youth in the capital, Quito, also held rallies and demonstrations for the same purpose.

In addition, students in Quito, Guayaquil, Loja, and Cuenca recently held rallies and demonstrations, demanding the abolition of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, the defense of national territorial sovereignty, and condemning the U.S. oil monopolies' attempt to use this protocol to plunder the rich oil resources in Ecuador's eastern forest region. The students participating in this demonstration continuously chanted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" and "Yankees go home!"

    高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”等口号
    厄瓜多尔青年怒砸美国领事馆
    新华社十二日讯　基多消息：厄瓜多尔第一大城市瓜亚基尔的青年学生最近举行反对美帝国主义的示威游行，袭击了美国领事馆。
    这次示威游行是为了纪念厄瓜多尔人民推翻前亲美军事独裁政权一周年而举行的。前军事独裁政权是在一九六三年七月由美国一手扶植起来的。自此以后，厄瓜多尔人民就一直进行着英勇的反美反独裁斗争，去年三月二十九日在人民群众强烈的反美反独裁斗争的冲击下，这个独裁政权宣告垮台。
    瓜亚基尔青年学生的游行队伍沿途高呼“打倒美帝国主义”等口号。学生们在市中心的广场上举行了集会，随后，奔向美国领事馆。他们沿途和手持马刀、使用催泪瓦斯的警察展开了英勇的搏斗。最后，学生们终于冲破了企图阻挡他们前进的大批军警的包围，到达了美国领事馆，并用石块打碎了领事馆的一些玻璃。学生的示威行动得到了这个城市的几个工会组织的支持。
    同一天，首都基多的青年学生也为了同样目的举行了群众集会和示威游行。
    此外，基多、瓜亚基尔、乐哈、昆卡等地的学生不久以前也举行了集会和示威游行，要求废除里约热内卢议定书、维护国家领土主权，谴责美国石油垄断集团企图利用这项议定书掠夺厄瓜多尔东部森林区丰富的石油资源。参加这次示威游行的学生们不断高呼“打倒美帝国主义”、“美国佬滚出去”等口号。
