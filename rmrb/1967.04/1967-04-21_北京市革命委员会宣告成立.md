Under the personal care and guidance of Chairman Mao, in the triumphant songs of the Cultural Revolution, the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing is proclaimed established. A grand gathering of 100,000 people in the capital celebrates the birth of the Revolutionary Committee, adopting the "Letter of Respect to Chairman Mao." Premier Zhou Enlai, representing Chairman Mao, Comrade Lin Biao, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, attended the celebration and delivered an important speech. Comrades Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, and others attended to offer congratulations. Comrade Jiang Qing, on behalf of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, delivered a speech. Comrade Xie Fuzhi, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, delivered a speech. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, on behalf of the revolutionary committee representatives from five provinces and municipalities, delivered a speech.

A report from Xinhua News Agency on April 20: In the residence of the great leader Chairman Mao, in the heart of our great motherland, in the unprecedented center of leadership for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the beacon of revolution that the revolutionary people of the world look up to—Beijing, today, news has spread that shakes the nation and the world: Under the personal care and guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ—the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee—has been triumphantly born.

The chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is Comrade Xie Fuzhi, and the vice chairmen are Comrades Wu De, Zheng Weishan, Fu Chongbi, and Nie Yuanzi.

The formal establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee marks the complete collapse of the important stronghold of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road—the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee. It marks the complete overthrow of the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee. This is a new great leap forward in the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries in the capital after the Party Central Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, decided in 1966 to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee. The establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has pushed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital to a new stage, setting a good example for the people of our country. It proves that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has solved a very important new problem of proletarian revolution in contemporary times, creating new experiences for the proletariat to prevent capitalist restoration after seizing power, to consolidate and develop the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to carry the socialist revolution through to the end. It enriches and develops the Marxist theory of scientific socialism, adding an immortal chapter to the history of the international communist movement.

Today, the capital is in a state of excitement, with millions of revolutionary masses immersed in the fiery revolutionary atmosphere and festive joy. The grand celebration of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held at the Workers' Stadium, with over 100,000 participants, is the center of the city's excitement.

Comrade Zhou Enlai, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, on behalf of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, attended the celebration and delivered a warm congratulatory speech (full text on page 2). The proletarian revolutionaries of the capital and the revolutionary masses of the entire city are deeply grateful for the personal care of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee; they enthusiastically cheer the birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out in his speech that the proletarian revolutionaries of Beijing have actively responded to Chairman Mao's call, actively responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, and waged a series of great struggles in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieving great victories. He said that on this basis, the proletarian revolutionaries and the Red Guards of Beijing, responding to Chairman Mao's call, through the conference of representatives of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards from colleges and universities, established a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletarian revolution—the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said, you have seized power, but the struggle between the two lines has not ended. Comrades of the proletarian revolutionaries in Beijing must, after seizing power, fully pay attention to strengthening and consolidating the power, truly grasp and use the power well.

Comrade Zhou Enlai emphasized that to achieve this goal, it is necessary to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. At present, it is necessary to study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, to more fully, deeply, and comprehensively expose and criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of anti-revolutionary revisionists in Beijing, and to link this to the struggle, criticism, and transformation within one's own unit. At the same time, in this great revolutionary criticism movement, it is necessary to further strengthen and develop the great alliance of revolutionaries and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." This is the direction of the struggle and must be firmly grasped.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said, we sincerely hope that you will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, cherish your victory, strengthen your sense of responsibility, and continuously consolidate and develop the power that has been seized, so that the capital where Chairman Mao resides will always be in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries, forever young and never fading.

Comrade Chen Boda, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and head of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, Comrade Kang Sheng, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and advisor to the Central Cultural Revolution Group, Comrade Li Fuchun, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, Comrade Xiao Hua, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Head of the Military Affairs Group of the Central Military Commission, Comrade Yang Chengwu, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Head of the Military Affairs Group of the Central Military Commission, Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, a member of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and Comrades Wang Li, Guan Feng, Chen Boda, Yao Wenyuan, and Ye Qun, members of the Military Affairs Group of the Central Military Commission, also attended the meeting.

Comrade Jiang Qing, in her speech at the meeting (full text on page 2), first, on behalf of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, warmly congratulated the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. She said that the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee marks a new victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing and will have a significant impact on the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in various places across the country.

Comrade Jiang Qing emphasized in her speech that two issues need to be addressed: the relationship between the great criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation within one's own unit, and the issue of supporting the army and loving the people.

She stressed that in the current stage of the proletarian revolutionaries' united struggle for power, it is necessary to launch a great criticism movement against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and at the same time, according to the different situations in various places, gradually shift to the struggle, criticism, and transformation within one's own unit.

Comrade Jiang Qing said that we now particularly emphasize the call to support the army and love the people. Revolutionary masses should correctly treat the army and support it. The army should also correctly treat the people and love them.

Comrade Jiang Qing finally said that we hope that the broad revolutionary masses of Beijing, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, in the revolutionary great criticism, consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolutionaries, and build Beijing into a great school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

The venue of the celebration of the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee was a sea of red, a classroom for studying Mao Zedong Thought. A giant color portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao was prominently displayed on the stage. Revolutionary red flags were everywhere, and revolutionary songs echoed. Opposite the stage, a large board with Chairman Mao's quotations was erected, reading: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, we are also good at building a new world." "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power, consolidating power. And the reactionaries fight to the death against the revolutionary forces, also completely for the purpose of maintaining their power." Ten thousand revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, People's Liberation Army soldiers, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary residents, holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," recited Chairman Mao's teachings over and over again, determined to put Chairman Mao's teachings into action. The giant balloon slogans in the sky read: "Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!" "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" "Proletarian revolutionaries of the whole country, unite!" "Workers of the world, unite!" "Long live the great leader, great commander, great helmsman, and great teacher Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The meeting began with the majestic melody of "The East Is Red."

Comrade Xie Fuzhi, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, first spoke on behalf of the committee at the meeting (full text on page 3). He emphasized that the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is the result of the proletarian revolutionaries of the capital, the workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals of the capital, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the proletarian revolutionary line, and waging a long and heroic struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line.

He said that the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, which had long been occupied by a handful of anti-revolutionary revisionists, under the protection and support of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, had always waved the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. They had always blocked the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, turning Beijing into an "independent kingdom" where "needles cannot be inserted and water cannot be poured in," attempting to turn Beijing into their base for counter-revolutionary restoration. This anti-revolutionary revisionist clique was a great bully sitting on the heads of the broad masses of the people in Beijing, committing heinous crimes against the Party and the people.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi pointed out that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries of the capital, responding to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, stormed the old Municipal Party Committee's anti-revolutionary revisionist lair, defeating them thoroughly. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee issued the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in the country from Beijing University and promptly decided to reorganize the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee and establish a new Municipal Party Committee, which was enthusiastically supported by the people of the entire city and the country, greatly promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that had just begun. However, the main leaders of the reorganized Beijing New Municipal Party Committee did not implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao but implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. In June and July 1966, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing was carried out under the direct control of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, turning Beijing into a base for promoting the bourgeois reactionary line. They pushed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing to the brink of failure and allowed the bourgeois reactionary line to spread throughout the country.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi said that at this critical moment, Chairman Mao returned to Beijing, saving the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee formulated the decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, announcing the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line and reigniting the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionaries of the capital, adhering to the proletarian revolutionary line, displaying the spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and rebel, smashed the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, repelled its repeated counterattacks, and fought against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. After a very sharp, very complex, and tortuous struggle, they achieved one victory after another.

He said that the proletarian revolutionaries of Shanghai launched the "January Revolution" storm. The proletarian revolutionaries of the capital, responding to Chairman Mao's call, launched a struggle from the bottom up to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. After a relatively long period of preparation, brewing, and consultation, they held the conference of representatives of the Red Guards of the capital's colleges and universities, the conference of revolutionary workers' representatives, the conference of representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants, and the conference of representatives of the Red Guards of middle schools. On the basis of the great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries, they established the temporary power organ of Beijing—the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee—according to Chairman Mao's policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi proposed the combat tasks facing the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. He said that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the top leader of revisionism in our country. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in some regions and departments are the backbone forces for them to implement the anti-revolutionary revisionist line. Thoroughly criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the most important combat task at present. We must firmly grasp this direction, fully mobilize the masses, and launch a mass movement to criticize them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, thoroughly clearing and purging their revisionist poison in all fields. We must, with the criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road as the center, overthrow, smash, and expose the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and seize back all the positions they have usurped. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, bravely join the battle, and thoroughly defeat the bourgeois reactionary line.

He said that in this great revolutionary mass criticism movement, we must further expand and consolidate the great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries. Proletarian revolutionaries, while transforming the objective world, must also constantly transform their subjective world.

He said that Chairman Mao teaches us: We must strive to unite with all those who can be united. The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also wants to liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot finally liberate itself. We must unite with the majority of cadres and the masses.

He said that we must, in conjunction with this revolutionary mass criticism movement, further implement Chairman Mao's policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Proletarian revolutionaries must focus on criticizing the part of the bourgeois reactionary line that "strikes a large number and protects a small number," support all cadres who want to make a revolution to stand up and revolutionize, and achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the struggle.

He said that through this revolutionary mass criticism movement, we must further mobilize the masses and better implement the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and with greater enthusiasm, strive to be the best, and struggle to complete and overfulfill the 1967 industrial and agricultural production plans.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi said that through this revolutionary mass criticism movement, we must further deepen the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We must plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in every factory, commune, shop, school, institution, and street in the capital, and in every inch of the capital's land. We must build the capital of the people, Beijing, into a city that forever shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, the reddest and most revolutionary city.

The meeting, in the midst of enthusiastic shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" adopted the "Letter of Respect to Chairman Mao" (full text on page 1). The letter of respect said:

On this grandest day of the proletarian revolutionaries, we cheer, we sing, and a million red hearts burst forth with a common voice: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! When we look back on the glorious history of our revolution, we cannot express our boundless loyalty to you with a thousand words, nor can we express our fervent praise with a thousand songs. The vast sea cannot contain our boundless respect and love for you.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! To ensure that the socialist mountains and rivers remain unchanged for thousands of generations, you personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, leading us to embark on a new Long March.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are our supreme commander, you are our most brilliant helmsman, we will forever follow you in making a revolution, forever follow you in advancing bravely through storms and waves! Whoever dares to oppose you, whoever dares to defame your brilliant thoughts, whoever dares to resist your proletarian revolutionary line, we will rebel against them, we will overthrow them, and make them never rise again!

Beloved Chairman Mao, we swear to you: We will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, and be your good soldiers. We will definitely study "The Three Articles" and "On Rectifying the Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "Against Liberalism," and other brilliant works as our guiding principles, and carry out a great revolution to seize the power of the "self" in our minds, and thoroughly criticize and transform our subjective world.

We will definitely follow your teachings and carry out rectification while fighting. We will resolutely oppose anarchism, thoroughly overcome factionalism, small-groupism, sectarianism, extreme democratism, lack of organizational consciousness, strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, establish a new revolutionary order of the proletariat, consolidate the great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries, and build our ranks into a highly proletarianized and combat-ready force.

Beijing is the capital of our great motherland, the hope and beacon of the revolutionary people of the world. Under your wise leadership, we proletarian revolutionaries of the capital are full of confidence and high morale, determined to build Beijing into the reddest and most revolutionary city that forever shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, and into a socialist red fortress against imperialism and revisionism in the world.

Representatives from the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress, Xu Jia, from the Beijing Municipal Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Congress, Zhang Guifu, from the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, Fu Chongbi, from the conference of representatives of the Red Guards of the capital's colleges and universities, Wei Dafu, and from the conference of representatives of the Red Guards of the capital's middle schools, Li Dongmin, spoke at the meeting in succession. They unanimously wished our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao a long life, a long life! They wished Comrade Lin Biao, the close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, good health and eternal health!

They pointed out in their speeches that the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee was established after thorough preparation, in accordance with Chairman Mao's policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." They unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support for proletarian authority and their firm support for the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

They expressed their determination to deeply launch the great criticism movement against the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and to link it with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their own units.

They said that in the new situation of the deepening development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely implement the various policies proposed by the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Municipal Party Committee, and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; firmly support the broad leftist masses, further expand and consolidate the great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries, implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and carry the struggle for power through to the end; in grasping revolution, promote production, strive for a double harvest of revolution and production; thoroughly purge the poison of the anti-revolutionary revisionist line politically, ideologically, and organizationally, block the road to capitalist restoration, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and strive to build a new Beijing that is guided by Mao Zedong Thought in everything and is red all over.

The revolutionary committee representatives from Shanghai, Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and Shandong, who specially came to Beijing to congratulate the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, attended the meeting. The representatives included Comrades Liu Geping, Zhang Riquing, Chen Yonggui, Chen Linshu, Li Zaichun, Li Li, He Guangyu, Pan Fusheng, Wang Jiadao, Zhang Wanchun, Wang Xiaoyu, Chen Lei, and Wang Wensu.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, a member of the Central Cultural Revolution Group and a leader of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, spoke on behalf of the representatives from the five provinces and municipalities attending the meeting (full text on page 4). He said:

Beijing is where our great leader Chairman Mao resides, the capital of our great motherland, and the center of our proletarian revolution. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries of Beijing, under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, have been at the forefront of the battle, making special contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country and establishing special merits.

Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is now at the height of the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries. The great criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is surging across the country. At this important moment, the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a great encouragement to the proletarian revolutionaries throughout the country. We are deeply convinced that this temporary power organ, formed in the revolutionary struggle, revolutionary, representative, and with proletarian revolutionary authority, will definitely be able to lead the proletarian revolutionaries of the capital to continue to be at the forefront of the battle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country, make more outstanding contributions to the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing and throughout the country, and build our great capital into a great school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, forever unchanging, and become a model for the country and an example for the world.

We are all soldiers of Chairman Mao, fighting in the same trench against the common enemy. Let us, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance shoulder to shoulder for the complete victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and for new victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction!

Following this, the revolutionary committee representatives from Heilongjiang Province presented to the meeting a copy of the inscription written by our great leader Chairman Mao in 1950 during his inspection of Heilongjiang Province for the broad revolutionary masses of Heilongjiang Province.

    新华社二十日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席的住地，在伟大祖国的心脏，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的领导中心，在世界革命人民仰望的革命灯塔——北京，今天传出了震动全国和全世界的喜讯：在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和指导下，一个实行革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构——北京市革命委员会胜利地诞生了。
    北京市革命委员会主任委员是谢富治同志，副主任委员是吴德、郑维山、傅崇碧、聂元梓四位同志。
    北京市革命委员会的正式成立，宣告了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派复辟资本主义的一个重要据点——旧北京市委、市人委彻底垮台了，它宣告旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团彻底倒台了。这是继毛主席和党中央一九六六年决定改组北京市委之后，首都无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的一个新的伟大的飞跃。北京市革命委员会的成立，把首都无产阶级文化大革命推进到一个崭新的阶段，为我国人民树立了一个好榜样。它证明伟大的无产阶级文化大革命解决了当代无产阶级革命的一个极为重要的新课题，为无产阶级夺取政权后防止资本主义复辟，为巩固和发展无产阶级专政和把社会主义革命进行到底创造了新经验，丰富和发展了马克思主义关于科学社会主义学说，在国际共产主义运动史上增添了不朽的篇章。
    今天，首都全城沸腾，数百万革命群众浸沉在火热的革命气氛和节日般的欢乐之中。有十万多人参加的在工人体育场隆重举行的北京市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会，是全城欢腾的中心。
    中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理周恩来同志，代表伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表党中央、国务院和中央军委，到会热烈祝贺，宣布中央已经批准北京市革命委员会的成立，并且作了重要讲话（全文见第二版）。首都无产阶级和全市革命群众，无限感激毛主席和党中央的亲切关怀；他们热烈欢呼北京市革命委员会的诞生。
    周恩来同志在讲话中强调指出，北京的无产阶级革命派积极响应毛主席的号召，积极响应林彪同志的号召，在无产阶级文化大革命中进行了一系列伟大斗争，取得了伟大的胜利。他说，在这个基础上，北京的无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将们，响应毛主席的号召，通过工人、贫下中农和大中学校红卫兵的代表会议，成立了北京市革命的具有代表性的无产阶级革命权威的临时权力机构。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    周恩来同志说，你们夺了权，但是，两条道路、两条路线的斗争，并没有结束。北京市无产阶级革命派的同志们在夺权后要充分重视政权的加强和巩固，真正地掌好权，用好权。
    周恩来同志强调说，为达到这个目的，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。在目前，就是要带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，更充分、更深入、更全面地揭露和批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和北京市一小撮反革命修正主义分子，并且联系到本单位的斗、批、改。同时，要在这个革命的大批判运动中，进一步加强和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。这是斗争的大方向，必须紧紧地把握住。
    周恩来同志说，我们衷心地希望，你们将更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，遵守毛主席的教导，珍视你们的胜利果实，加强你们的责任感，不断地巩固和发展已经夺得的权力，让毛主席住在的首都永远掌握在无产阶级革命派的手里，永葆青春，永不变色。
    中共中央政治局常委、中央文革小组组长陈伯达，中共中央政治局常委、中央文革小组顾问康生，中共中央政治局常委、国务院副总理李富春，中央文革小组第一副组长江青，中共中央委员、中央军委文革小组副组长、中国人民解放军总政治部主任萧华，中共中央候补委员、中央军委文革小组副组长、中国人民解放军代总参谋长杨成武，中央文革小组副组长张春桥，中央文革小组成员王力、关锋、戚本禹、姚文元，中央军委文革小组成员叶群等同志，也参加了今天的大会。
    江青同志在大会上讲话（全文见第二版）时，首先代表中央文革小组热烈祝贺北京市革命委员会的成立。她说，北京市革命委员会的建立，标志着北京市无产阶级文化大革命取得了新的胜利，并将对全国各地无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，起着重大的影响。
    江青同志在讲话中着重谈了两个问题，一个是大批判和本单位斗、批、改的关系问题，一个是拥军爱民的问题。
    她强调说，在当前无产阶级革命派联合夺权的这个阶段中，应该开展对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动，同时，按各地不同的情况，逐步地转入本单位的斗批改。
    江青同志说，我们现在特别强调地提出拥军爱民的号召。革命群众要正确地对待军队，要拥军。军队也要正确地对待群众，要爱民。
    江青同志最后说，我们希望，北京市的广大革命群众，在北京市革命委员会的领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在革命的大批判中，巩固和发展革命的大联合，把北京市建设成为一个活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。
    北京市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会会场，是一片红色的海洋，是一个学习毛泽东思想的课堂。伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅彩色画像高挂在大会主席台上。革命的红旗插遍全场，革命的歌声响彻四方。主席台对面高竖着毛主席语录牌，上面写着：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”十万革命职工、贫下中农、人民解放军指战员、革命师生、革命干部和革命居民，捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地齐声诵读毛主席的教诲，决心把毛主席的教导落实到行动上。会场上空的巨大气球标语上写着：“无产阶级专政万岁！”“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”“全国无产阶级革命派联合起来！”“全世界无产者联合起来！”“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    大会在《东方红》雄壮乐曲声中开始。
    北京市革命委员会主任委员谢富治同志，代表革命委员会在大会上首先讲话（全文见第三版）。他强调地指出，北京市革命委员会的成立，是首都的无产阶级革命派，首都的工、农、兵和革命知识分子，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持无产阶级革命路线，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，同资产阶级反动路线进行了长期的英勇斗争的结果。
    他说，一小撮反革命修正主义分子长期盘踞下的旧北京市委，在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的庇护和支持下，一贯打着“红旗”反红旗。他们一贯对以毛主席为首的党中央实行封锁，把北京搞成一个“针插不进，水泼不进”的独立王国，妄图把北京变成他们实行反革命复辟的基地。这个反革命修正主义集团，是骑在北京广大人民群众头上的大恶霸，对党、对人民犯下了滔天罪行。
    谢富治同志指出，在无产阶级文化大革命中，首都的无产阶级革命派，响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，直捣旧市委反革命修正主义的老巢，把他们打得落花流水。毛主席和党中央批发了北京大学的全国第一张马克思列宁主义的大字报，及时作出改组北京旧市委、组织新市委的决定，得到全市人民和全国人民的热烈拥护，大大推动了当时刚刚兴起的无产阶级文化大革命。但是，改组后的北京新市委的主要负责人，没有执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，却执行了资产阶级反动路线。一九六六年六、七月间，北京市的无产阶级文化大革命，是在党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派直接控制之下进行的，他们把北京变成了推行资产阶级反动路线的基地。他们把北京的无产阶级文化大革命推到夭折的边缘，并且使资产阶级反动路线流毒全国。
    谢富治同志说，在这个关键的时刻，毛主席回到北京，挽救了无产阶级文化大革命。党的八届十一中全会制定了关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产，重新点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。首都的无产阶级革命派，坚持无产阶级革命路线，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的精神，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖，打退了它们一次又一次的反扑，斗争了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。经过十分尖锐、十分复杂和曲折的斗争，取得了一个接着一个的胜利。
    他说，上海市的无产阶级革命派掀起了“一月革命”风暴。首都的无产阶级革命派响应毛主席的号召，自下而上地开展了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，经过较长时间的准备和酝酿、协商，分别召开了首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会，革命职工代表会议，贫下中农代表会议和中等学校红卫兵代表大会，在无产阶级革命派大联合的基础上，按照毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的方针，建立了北京市的临时权力机构——北京市革命委员会。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    谢富治同志提出了北京市革命委员会所面临的战斗任务。他说，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，是我国修正主义的总头头。某些地区、某些部门的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，则是他们推行反革命修正主义路线的基干力量。彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，这是当前最重要的战斗任务。我们一定要紧紧掌握这个大方向，充分发动群众，大搞群众运动，从政治上、思想上、理论上进行全面的批判，彻底清算和肃清他们在各个领域内的修正主义流毒。我们要以批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派为中心，把旧北京市委的反革命修正主义集团和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，夺回被他们篡夺去的一切阵地。我们一定要响应毛主席的伟大号召，高举革命的批判旗帜，勇敢地投入战斗，彻底打倒资产阶级反动路线。
    他说，我们一定要在这场伟大的革命的群众性的批判运动中，进一步扩大和巩固无产阶级革命派的大联合。无产阶级革命派在改造客观世界的同时，也要不断改造自己的主观世界。
    他说，毛主席教导我们：要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。我们一定要团结干部和群众的大多数。
    他说，我们要结合这场革命的群众性的批判运动，进一步贯彻执行毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的方针。无产阶级革命派，要着重批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分，支持一切愿意革命的干部起来革命，在斗争中实现革命的“三结合”。
    他说，我们要通过这场革命的群众性的批判运动，进一步发动群众，更好地贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”的方针，更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，为完成和超额完成一九六七年的工农业生产计划而奋斗。
    谢富治同志说，我们要通过这场革命的群众性的批判运动，更深入地开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。我们要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍首都的每一个工厂，每一个公社，每一个商店，每一个学校，每一个机关，每一条街道，插遍首都的每一寸土地。我们要把人民的首都北京，建设成永远闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的最红最红的革命城市。
    大会在“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”的热烈欢呼声中，通过了《给毛主席的致敬信》（全文见第一版）。致敬信中说：
    在这无产阶级革命派最盛大的节日里，我们欢呼，我们歌唱，千万颗红心迸发出一个共同的声音：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！当我们回顾我国革命的光辉历程的时候，千言万语倾诉不尽我们对您的无限忠诚，千歌万曲表达不出我们对您的热情歌颂，浩荡的大海容纳不下我们对您的无限崇敬和无限热爱。

    敬爱的毛主席，我们向您宣誓：永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。我们一定要把“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》等光辉著作当作座右铭来学，在灵魂深处开展破“私”立“公”的大革命，大夺头脑中“私”字的权。我们一定遵循您的教导，边战斗，边整风。我们要大反无政府主义，彻底克服山头主义，小团体主义，宗派主义，极端民主化，非组织观念，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，建立无产阶级的革命新秩序，巩固无产阶级革命派的大联合，把我们的队伍建设成一支非常无产阶级化，非常战斗化的队伍。
    北京是伟大祖国的首都，是世界革命人民的希望和灯塔。在您的英明领导下，我们首都无产阶级革命派信心百倍，斗志昂扬，一定要把北京建设成永远闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的最红最红的无产阶级革命的城市，建设成世界上反帝反修的社会主义红色堡垒。

    他们在发言中指出，北京市革命委员会是经过充分酝酿，按照毛主席的革命的“三结合”的方针建立起来的。他们一致表示：热忱拥护无产阶级权威，坚决拥护北京市革命委员会。
    他们表示，要深入开展对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动，并且把它同本单位的斗批改结合起来。
    他们说，在无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的新形势下，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决执行北京市革命委员会按照毛泽东思想提出的各项政策，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派、旧市委反革命修正主义集团和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，批深、批透，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭；坚决支持左派广大群众，进一步扩大和巩固无产阶级革命派大联合，实行革命的“三结合”，把夺权斗争进行到底；在抓好革命的基础上促进生产，争取革命、生产双丰收；从政治上、思想上、组织上彻底肃清反革命修正主义路线的一切流毒，堵塞资本主义复辟的道路，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为建设一个以毛泽东思想统帅一切的、红彤彤的新北京而奋斗。

    中央文革小组副组长、上海市革命委员会负责人张春桥同志，代表出席大会的五个省市的代表团讲话
  （全文见第四版）。他说：
    北京是我们伟大领袖毛主席居住的地方，是我们伟大祖国的首都，是我们无产阶级革命的中心。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，北京市的无产阶级革命派在以毛主席为首的党中央的直接领导下，走在战斗的最前列，对全国的无产阶级文化大革命作出了特殊的贡献，建立了特殊的功勋。
    我们的无产阶级文化大革命，正处在无产阶级革命派联合夺权的斗争高潮中。对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，正在全国兴起。在这个重要的时刻，北京市革命委员会的成立，对全国的无产阶级革命派是极大的鼓舞。我们深信，这个在革命斗争中形成的、革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级革命权威的临时权力机构，一定能够领导首都的无产阶级革命派，继续走在全国文化大革命的战斗前列，对夺取北京市和全国文化大革命的彻底胜利，作出更出色的贡献，一定能够把我们伟大的首都，建设成为活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校，永不变色，成为全国的模范，世界的榜样。
    我们都是毛主席的战士，我们是在一条战壕里向共同的敌人作战。让我们在毛主席的领导下，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，为以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的彻底胜利，为无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新胜利，肩并肩地奋勇前进！
