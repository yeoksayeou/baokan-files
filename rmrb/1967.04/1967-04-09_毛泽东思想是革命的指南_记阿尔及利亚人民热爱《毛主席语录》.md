Algerian friends are everywhere searching for the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," searching for the "little red book" that is "a must-read every day," searching for the "guide to revolution."

In recent times, in some bookstores in Algiers, customers often come in to inquire: "Do you have the 'little red book'?" Many Algerians also frequently come to the Chinese Embassy in Algeria and the Xinhua News Agency branch office to request this precious book. Some even leave their addresses, hoping that when the Arabic version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is available, they will receive a copy. Many people living in Oran, Constantine, and Tlemcen and other places write letters requesting "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Some friends wrote in their letters: "I need the 'little red book'." "I love Mao Zedong!" "Long live the great teacher of the oppressed peoples of the world, Chairman Mao!"

Not long ago, on the streets of Algiers, a reporter met an acquaintance, a young man. As soon as they met, the young man tightly grasped the reporter's hand and anxiously said: "I have been looking for you. I need your help." As he spoke, he pulled the reporter to the side of the road, lifted his jacket, and took out a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from his inner pocket. He continued: "I read a page from it every morning. If I don't read it for a day, I feel like I am missing something. I carry this book with me all the time and never leave it. But do you know, it was really hard for me to get this 'little red book'!"

He then detailed to the reporter how he obtained this precious book: When he heard that a bookstore in Paris was reprinting the book, he immediately wrote to reserve a copy; later, he heard that a bookstore in Algiers had received a batch from Beijing, so he hurried to buy it, visiting several bookstores, all of which said it had not yet arrived. The copy he now has was borrowed from a friend.

After telling this story, he put the book back in his pocket and formally requested the reporter: "I am not asking for myself, but for my friends. I have more than ten friends who need this book. Please think of a way." When the reporter agreed to his request, he jumped up excitedly, saying: "Great! Great!"

One day, the reporter visited a former underground worker who had been sentenced to death by French colonialists before Algeria's independence and gave him a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He excitedly said: "Thank you, thank you, this is the most precious gift." He gently touched this precious red book and smiled as he told the reporter: "Although I already have this book and have read it, my wife asks for it every day." He said: "Today, you gave me a copy, which just solved my problem. My wife will be very happy." He then invited the reporter to his home. As soon as they entered the door, he told his wife: "The Chinese brother brought you the best gift. Guess what it is?" He then reminded her: "It's a book..." His wife immediately smiled: "Ah! It must be the 'little red book'!" She quickly took "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from her husband's pocket and said: "Many Algerian brothers love to read Mao Zedong's works, and so do I..." Her husband continued: "Yes, Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest leader of the revolutionary peoples of the world. In the past, when I was in prison, I saw many comrades secretly reading Chairman Mao's works. Now that China is undergoing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we Algerians are very concerned about this revolution, so more and more people are reading Chairman Mao's works. I think, to make a revolution, one must study Mao Zedong's works; with Mao Zedong, the world revolution will definitely be victorious."

A military officer who had fought a long guerrilla war in the famous revolutionary base area of the Aurès Mountains in Algeria told the reporter that he reads "Quotations from Chairman Mao" every day and also discusses it with his friends. He said: Algerian old guerrillas love Chairman Mao very much. In the early days of the Algerian War of National Liberation, the old guerrillas began to use Chairman Mao's famous thesis on people's war to strike at the French colonialists. At that time, it was not easy to find Chairman Mao's works, so they used mimeograph or handwritten methods to spread Chairman Mao's quotations among the guerrillas. As he spoke, he took out a notebook no larger than a cigarette case, opened the page marked 1967, and pointed to a few lines of densely written small characters, saying to the reporter: "This is a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations that I copied: 'The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.'" He said that every year when he gets a new notebook, he copies some of Chairman Mao's words to remember them in his heart. He said: "Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war have played an immeasurable role in the contemporary people's liberation movement. Today, the Vietnamese people are successfully applying the thoughts of people's war, flexibly and mobilely annihilating the U.S. army. The U.S. army will not withdraw from Vietnam, and it will eventually be annihilated. Vietnam will surely win, this is the conclusion."

Once, several Algerian friends were enthusiastically discussing "Quotations from Chairman Mao." One friend pointed out: Imperialism and revisionism are colluding, taking joint action. They fabricate rumors to oppose China. Not long ago, Soviet police even beat Chinese students reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Another friend said, Chairman Mao said well: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." Imperialism and revisionism unite to oppose China, which just proves that the Chinese people are right. He said that after reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he was deeply impressed. He can now recite some quotations and even remember the page numbers. At this time, a union worker walked over and said, "When I first got this 'little red book,' I read it through. Later, the more I read, the more I wanted to read. I feel that every word of Mao Zedong is powerful, speaking for the working people. Mao Zedong understands the people's hearts, understands the people's demands. He belongs to the people of the whole world."

    毛泽东思想是革命的指南
    ——记阿尔及利亚人民热爱《毛主席语录》
    阿尔及利亚朋友到处在寻找红彤彤的宝书《毛主席语录》，寻找“每天必读的小红书”，寻找“革命的指南”。
    最近一个时期，在阿尔及尔的一些书店里，常常有顾客进去打听：“有‘小红书’吗？”许多阿尔及利亚人还不断地来到中国驻阿尔及利亚使馆和新华分社，索要这本宝书。有的人还留下地址，希望将来有了阿拉伯文版的《毛主席语录》时，寄给他一本。不少居住在奥兰、君士坦丁和特累姆森等外地的人则写信来，要《毛主席语录》。有些朋友在信中这样热情地写道：“我需要‘小红书’。”“我热爱毛泽东！”“世界被压迫人民的导师、伟大的毛主席万岁！”
    不久前，在阿尔及尔的大街上，记者遇到一位相识的青年。一见面，这位青年就紧紧地握着记者的手，焦急地说道：“我一直在找你，我需要你帮助。”他一边说，一边把记者拉到路旁，掀开他的上衣，从里面的口袋里掏出一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》。他接着说：“我现在每天早晨读一页。只要一天不读，我就好象缺少了什么似的。我随身带着这本书，一刻也不离开这本书。但是你可知道，我得到这本‘小红书’，可真不容易呀！”
    接着，他便详细地向记者叙述了他得到这本宝书的经过：当他听说巴黎有个书店要翻印这本书时，就连忙写信去预订；后来又听说阿尔及尔的书店已从北京运来了一批，又连忙去买，找了几家书店，都说还没有运到。他现在手里的这一本，还是从一位朋友那里要来的。
    他介绍完这段经过后，把书放进口袋里，才正式向记者提出要求说：“我找你，不是为了我自己，而是为了我的朋友。我有十多个朋友，都需要这本书，请你想个办法。”当记者答应他的要求后，他兴奋得跳了起来，连说：“太好了！太好了！”
    有一天，记者去拜访一位在阿尔及利亚独立前曾被法国殖民主义者判处过死刑的地下工作者，并送给他一本《毛主席语录》。他激动地说：“谢谢你，谢谢你，这是最珍贵的礼物。”他轻轻地摸了摸这本珍贵的红书，微笑着告诉记者：虽然他本人已经有了这本书，并且读了，但是他的妻子天天跟他要。他说：“今天你送给我一本，正好替我解决了这个难题。我的妻子一定会高兴的。”说完，他便请记者到他家去作客。刚刚走进他家的大门，他就对他妻子说：“中国兄弟给你带来了最好的礼物，你猜是什么？”他接着又提醒说：“是书……。”他妻子马上笑起来：“呵！一定是‘小红书’！”她抢着从她丈夫的口袋里掏出《毛主席语录》，说道：“许多阿尔及利亚兄弟都爱读毛泽东的著作，我也爱读……”她丈夫接着说：“是呀，毛泽东同志是世界革命人民的最伟大的领袖。过去我在监狱里，就看到许多战友偷偷阅读毛主席著作。现在中国正进行文化大革命，我们阿尔及利亚人非常关心这一革命，因此读毛主席著作的人也越来越多。我认为，要革命，就要学习毛泽东的著作；有了毛泽东，世界革命就一定能胜利。”
    一位曾经在阿尔及利亚著名的革命根据地——奥雷斯山区打过长期游击战争的军官告诉记者说，他现在每天都要读《毛主席语录》，并且还同他的朋友进行讨论。他说：阿尔及利亚的老游击队员非常热爱毛主席。在阿尔及利亚民族解放战争的初期，老游击队员们就开始运用毛主席关于人民战争的著名论断，打击法国殖民主义者。那时候，不容易找到毛主席著作，他们便用油印或手抄的办法，在游击队员中间传播毛主席的语录。说着，他拿出一个只有香烟盒大小的记事本，翻开写有一九六七年字样的第一页，指着几行密密麻麻的小字向记者说：“这就是我抄的一段毛主席语录：‘敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追’。”他说，他每年换新记事本时，都要抄录一些毛主席的话，以便牢记在心里。他说：“毛主席的人民战争的思想，对于当代人民解放运动起了不可估量的作用。今天越南人民正在成功地运用着人民战争的思想，机动灵活地消灭着美国军队。美国军队不撤出越南，迟早会被消灭干净。越南必胜，这是结论。”
    有一次，几位阿尔及利亚朋友在一起兴致勃勃地谈论《毛主席语录》。有位朋友指出：帝国主义和修正主义勾结在一起，采取联合行动。它们捏造谣言，反对中国。不久以前，苏联警察甚至殴打读《毛主席语录》的中国留学生。另一位朋友接着说，毛主席说得好：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。帝国主义和修正主义联合反华，恰好证明中国人民做对了。他说，他读了《毛主席语录》后，印象很深刻。他现在已经能够背出一些语录，甚至还能记住页数。这时候，一位工会工作者走过来说，“当我第一天得到这本‘小红书’的时候，我就读了一遍。后来我越读越想读。我感到毛泽东的每一句话，都是有力量的，都是替劳动人民说话的。毛泽东了解人民的心，了解人民的要求。他是属于全世界人民的。”　　新华社记者
