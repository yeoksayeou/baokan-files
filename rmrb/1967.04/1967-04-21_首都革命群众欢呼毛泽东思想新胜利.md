Today, the revolutionary workers, peasants, cadres, students, and residents of the capital celebrated with great joy the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, a "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ, under the warm care and guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao. The revolutionary masses, with drums and gongs, paraded through the streets all day long. People enthusiastically cheered the boundless victory of Mao Zedong Thought! They cheered the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! They sincerely wished our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao eternal life! The revolutionary masses firmly declared: Under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee. We will seize power and use it well to ensure that Beijing remains a red fortress of the proletariat forever!

Today, the great capital of our motherland is adorned with red flags, and joy fills every street and alley. The building where the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is located stands particularly majestic and magnificent. The giant portrait of our most beloved red sun, Chairman Mao, hangs prominently in the center of the building. On either side of the building, large quotation boards display the instructions of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao. From dawn, revolutionary warriors stationed at various posts, holding high red flags and copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," came from all directions to celebrate, continuing until late at night.

In the afternoon, when the grand celebration rally with ten thousand participants was held, even more revolutionary masses watched the event on television and radio, listening to the speeches of central leaders, and were deeply moved. A responsible person from the Beijing Stamp Factory Revolutionary Committee joyfully said: "Amidst the calls of the billion revolutionary people to denounce the number one power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, our long-awaited Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been established. This is a great joy for the people of the capital and a great joy for the people of the entire nation. Under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, we will respond to Chairman Mao's great call, more broadly and deeply criticize the number one power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionism within the former Beijing Municipal Committee and Municipal People's Committee, and in conjunction with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our unit, thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism. The revolutionary workers of this factory declare that we will further strive to implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of 'grasp revolution, promote production.' In the midst of the great criticism, we will strengthen revolutionary unity, grasp revolution, and vigorously promote production, rapidly and with high quality print the commemorative stamps of Chairman Mao's reception of the Red Guards, to meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs were overjoyed upon hearing the live broadcast of the rally. The revolutionary masses of Tongxian, Pinggu, Fangshan, and Yanqing counties held celebration meetings or discussion meetings. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: The power of Beijing has been seized back by us, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. This is a great joy. We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly support the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, grasp revolution, promote production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

The soldiers of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison Command, who are supporting the Zhong-Ao Friendship People's Commune, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants of this commune, celebrated the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. The soldiers unanimously declared that they would respond to Chairman Mao's great call, learn from the revolutionary masses, unite with the revolutionary masses, and fight shoulder to shoulder, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, supported by the number one power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, in the countryside. While grasping revolution, they will vigorously promote production, and report the good news to Chairman Mao with actual actions.

The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of various schools in Beijing were immersed in the joy of the festival all day today. They said, the birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, must cherish this newly born revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ like our own eyes. Under Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, together with the revolutionary masses of the entire city and nation, we will carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end and turn the capital into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

At night, the Tiananmen Gate and the East and West Chang'an Streets were brightly lit. The revolutionary masses and the Red Guards sang and danced, joyfully celebrating the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.
