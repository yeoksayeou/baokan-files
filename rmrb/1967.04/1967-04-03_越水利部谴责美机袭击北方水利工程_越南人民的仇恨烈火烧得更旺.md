	The Vietnamese Ministry of Water Resources has condemned U.S. air raids on water projects in North Vietnam, stating that such attacks only fuel the Vietnamese people's hatred and resolve to continue the struggle against U.S. aggression.

	According to reports from Hanoi, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Water Resources of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on March 31. The statement asserted that the U.S. imperialists' attacks on water projects in North Vietnam only serve to intensify the Vietnamese people's hatred and determination to carry out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to fight to the end in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

	The statement pointed out that after the barbaric attack on the water projects in Nghe An Province in early March, the U.S. imperialists continued to dispatch aircraft to attack water projects in several provinces, including Thanh Hoa, Ninh Binh, Ha Tinh, Thai Binh, and Nghe An, from March 11 to March 27.

	The statement said that the aforementioned barbaric attacks by the U.S. imperialists aim to disrupt production in North Vietnam and threaten the lives of the Vietnamese people. These actions are new, extremely inhuman crimes committed by the U.S. imperialists and are an unforgivable provocation against progressive peoples. These actions further expose the savage, aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism.

	The statement strongly condemns the new crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors and demands that they immediately stop their attacks on water projects and dikes in North Vietnam. It also demands that they permanently and unconditionally cease all bombing and other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
