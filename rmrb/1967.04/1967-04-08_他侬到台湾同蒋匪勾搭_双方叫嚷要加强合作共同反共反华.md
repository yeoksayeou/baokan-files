He Sits Down with Chiang Bandits in Taiwan

The U.S. imperialism's faithful lackey, Thai Prime Minister Thanom, arrived in Taiwan on March 27th with a large "government delegation" and engaged in activities for a week, serving the U.S. master's scheme to cobble together an anti-communist, anti-China puppet bloc in Southeast Asia.

According to reports, Thanom hurried to Taiwan on the very day it was announced that U.S. B-52 bombers would be stationed in Thailand. Within a week, Thanom and the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek held three secret talks on the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, the situation in Southeast Asia, and the collusion of the U.S. puppet bloc. Finally, they issued a "joint communiqué," boasting that they would cooperate with U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war in Southeast Asia, and work together to oppose communism and China.

It is revealed that during his activities in Taiwan, Thanom also met with various leaders of the Chiang clique in the military, political, and economic spheres. While "visiting" the U.S.-Chiang military bases, he shouted that the Chiang and Thai sides should further strengthen military collusion. Thanom left Taipei on the 2nd, leading his entourage to South Korea for activities.

    他侬到台湾同蒋匪勾搭
    双方叫嚷要加强合作共同反共反华
    新华社四日讯　台北消息：美帝国主义的忠实走狗泰国总理他侬，三月二十七日率领一个庞大的“政府代表团”到台湾活动了七天，为美国主子拼凑东南亚反共反华仆从集团的阴谋效劳。
    据报道，他侬是在刚刚宣布美国B—52轰炸机进驻泰国的当天迫不及待地赶到台湾活动的。在一周之内，他侬和匪首蒋介石曾就美国侵越战争、东南亚局势和美国的傀儡集团的勾结问题举行了三次密谈，最后并发表“联合公报”，扬言要配合美帝国主义对东南亚的侵略政策和战争活动，“齐心协力”，共同反共反华。
    据透露，他侬在台湾活动期间，还会见了蒋帮军事、政治、经济等各方面的头目，并在“参观”美蒋的军事基地时，叫嚷蒋、泰双方要进一步加强军事勾结。他侬已经在二日离开台北，带领原班人马赶往南朝鲜活动。
