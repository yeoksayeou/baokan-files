Nakajima Kenzo, a committee member of the Japan Council of the Asian-African Writers' Conference and a renowned critic, gave a talk to a Chinese journalist on March 30. He strongly denounced the fake "Third Asian-African Writers' Conference" orchestrated by the Soviet revisionist leadership in Beirut. He firmly supported the decision made by the emergency meeting of Asian-African writers to hold the Third Asian-African Writers' Conference in Beijing this year.

Nakajima said that the struggle between two lines has always been at the core of the Asian-African writers' movement. The genuine Asian-African writers' movement must oppose imperialism led by the United States and both old and new colonialism. It must also oppose modern revisionism and resolutely support the struggle of Asian and African peoples to unite and fight against imperialism for liberation.

Nakajima emphasized that the fake "Third Asian-African Writers' Conference" orchestrated by the Soviet revisionist leadership is completely illegal. It is an outright splitist conference.

In exposing the Soviet revisionists' choice of timing for staging the fake "Third Asian-African Writers' Conference," Nakajima pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership is currently in cahoots with U.S. imperialism, actively plotting to let the U.S. stay in South Vietnam and sacrifice the interests of the entire Vietnamese people in the so-called "Vietnam peace talks." In this context, holding a splitist conference is obviously aimed at disrupting the struggle of the Vietnamese people and people of all countries to unite and fight against imperialism, thereby serving U.S. imperialism's aggressive policies.

Nakajima further pointed out that another purpose of the Soviet revisionist leadership in orchestrating the splitist conference is to attempt to obstruct the tremendous influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

Nakajima said that the Soviet revisionist leadership is trying to reduce the Asian-African writers' movement to merely the realm of "literature and art," preventing Asian-African writers from being concerned with politics. Nakajima then pointed out that today, genuine Asian-African writers not only need to be concerned with anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist politics but also need to engage in anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist political struggles.

    中岛健藏说亚非作家运动始终贯穿两条路线斗争
    亚非革命作家必须投入反帝反修斗争
    坚决支持今年在北京召开第三届亚非作家大会
    新华社东京三十一日电　亚非作家会议日本协议会委员、著名评论家中岛健藏三十日对中国记者发表谈话，严厉谴责苏联修正主义领导集团一手策划的在贝鲁特召开的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”，坚决支持亚非作家紧急会议关于今年在北京召开的第三届亚非作家大会的正式决定。
    中岛说，亚非作家运动始终贯穿着两条路线的斗争。真正的亚非作家运动，必须反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，反对现代修正主义，坚决支持亚非人民团结反帝、争取解放的斗争。
    中岛强调指出，苏联修正主义领导集团一手策划的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”是完全非法的，它是一个不折不扣的分裂会议。
    中岛健藏在揭露苏修选择目前时机导演伪“第三届亚非作家大会”的丑剧时指出，苏联修正主义领导集团正在同美帝国主义打得火热，积极策划让美帝赖在南越、牺牲全体越南人民利益的所谓“越南和谈”，在这种情况下召开分裂会议，其目的显然是要破坏越南人民以及世界各国人民团结反帝的斗争，从而为美帝国主义的侵略政策效劳。
    中岛进一步指出，苏联修正主义领导集团策划分裂会议的另一个目的，是妄图阻止由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命巨大影响。
    中岛说，苏联修正主义领导集团企图把亚非作家运动仅仅缩小到所谓“文学艺术”的圈子里，让亚非作家不去关心政治。中岛接着指出，今天，真正的亚非作家不仅要关心反帝、反修的政治，而且还应当投身到反帝、反修的政治斗争中去。
