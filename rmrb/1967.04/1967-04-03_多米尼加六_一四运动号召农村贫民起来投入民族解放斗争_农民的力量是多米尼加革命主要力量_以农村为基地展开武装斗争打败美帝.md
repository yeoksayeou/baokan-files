The June 14 Movement in the Dominican Republic's southern region recently issued a call to the rural poor, urging them to abandon all illusions and, under the leadership of the working class, join forces with urban and rural people of all classes to resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The call emphasized that victory can only be achieved through armed struggle.

The call stated, "The vast majority of rural residents in the Dominican Republic, especially those who have no land and can only make a living by doing odd jobs, as well as those who have only a small amount of poor land and have to sell their labor part of the year to barely make ends meet, all agricultural workers and poor peasants, live in extreme poverty and are severely oppressed and exploited, trampled underfoot."

The call pointed out that the successive governments of the Dominican Republic have been unable to solve the land problem of the peasants, and the current Balaguer government is no exception, because "this government is propped up by the Americans through fraudulent means and is used to protect the exploiters such as big merchants and landlords."

The call stressed, "Those in the countryside who rely on odd jobs for a living or have no land should not harbor any illusions and should no longer believe the false promises of politicians and political parties. ... The rural poor must organize and fight mercilessly to destroy the barbed wire fences of the landlords' large estates. ... Only under the leadership of a truly revolutionary party, tempered through countless trials, can the rural poor actively participate in the revolutionary struggle, achieve national liberation, and stride forward towards complete liberation in the future."

The call emphasized that the main enemy of the Dominican people is U.S. imperialism. "Our struggle is directed against U.S. imperialists and their local allies: the big landlords, big merchants, and the powerful figures in the Balaguer government."

The call further pointed out that this struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys can only be won through armed struggle. The call said, "This arduous and protracted struggle cannot be won in one go. It must start from organizing and mobilizing peasants to fight for their own rights and democratic demands, and inevitably lead to a war of the working people against the exploiters. ... The experience of the Dominican Republic has shown us that there is no other way. The people will wage war and win. The rural poor play a very important role, as they make up the majority of the population, and without their participation, the revolution cannot succeed."

The call said that the reason the anti-imperialist armed struggle of the Dominican people in April 1965 did not succeed was because "the majority of the population, the peasants, did not participate"; and "the revolution was carried out in the cities, which is where the enemy could effectively mobilize its forces."

The call concluded, "Although our enemies appear strong at present, ... in the long run, they are not as strong as they seem. As long as the peasants are well organized and fight in rural areas where the enemy's tanks cannot enter and planes cannot operate, unite with the working class, accept the leadership of the working class through its party, and fight together with all other classes that rise up against exploitation and poverty, victory is certain."

    多米尼加六·一四运动号召农村贫民起来投入民族解放斗争
    农民的力量是多米尼加革命主要力量
    以农村为基地展开武装斗争打败美帝
    新华社二日讯　圣多明各消息：多米尼加六·一四运动南方地区委员会最近向南方农村贫民发出呼吁书，号召广大农民丢掉一切幻想，在工人阶级的领导下，同城乡各阶层人民一起，向美帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决的斗争，通过武装斗争取得胜利。
    呼吁书说，多米尼加“绝大部分农村居民，特别是没有土地只能打零工糊口的人，以及只有少量坏地、每年得靠部分时间出卖劳动力才能勉强混上吃穿的人，所有农业工人和贫农，都过着非常悲惨的贫困生活，备受压迫和剥削，被人踏在脚下。”
    呼吁书指出，多米尼加的历届政府都不能解决农民的土地问题，现在的巴拉格尔政府也是一样，因为这个政府“是由美国佬通过欺诈手段一手扶持起来的，是用来保护大商人和大地主等剥削者的”。
    呼吁书强调指出，“农村中一切靠打零工糊口或没有土地的人们不要存有幻想，再也不能相信一些政客和政党的虚伪诺言，……农村贫民只有组织起来，毫不留情地进行斗争，才能摧毁地主的大农场的铁丝网”。“农村贫民唯有在一个经过千锤百炼的真正革命政党的领导下，积极参加革命斗争，才能实现民族解放革命，朝着将来彻底解放的方向大踏步前进。”
    呼吁书强调说，多米尼加人民的主要敌人是美帝国主义。“我们斗争的矛头对准美帝国主义者及其在本地的同盟者：大地主、大商人和巴拉格尔政府中的权贵”。
    呼吁书进一步指出，这一反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，只有通过武装斗争，才能取得胜利。呼吁书说，“这场艰难困苦的长期斗争是不能一举成功的。应该从组织和动员农民争取自身的权利和民主要求入手，而以开展劳动人民反对剥削者的战争为必然归宿”。“多米尼加的经验告诉了我们，除此之外，别无其他办法。人民将进行战争并取得胜利。农村贫民起着十分重要的作用，他们占人口的大多数，没有他们参加，革命就搞不起来。”
    呼吁书说，多米尼加人民一九六五年四月的反美爱国武装斗争之所以没有取得成功，就是因为“占人口大多数的农民没有参加”；同时，“革命在城市进行，而这正是敌人能有效地调动其力量的地方。”
    呼吁书最后说：“尽管在目前我们的敌人貌似强大，……但是从长远来说，他们实际上并非如此。只要农民很好地组织起来，在敌人的坦克进不去、飞机起不了作用的农村地区进行斗争，同工人阶级团结起来，通过工人阶级的政党接受工人阶级的领导，同其他一切奋起反对剥削和贫困的阶层一起战斗，就一定能取得胜利。”
