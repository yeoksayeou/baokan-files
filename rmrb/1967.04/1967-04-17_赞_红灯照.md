In the awe-inspiring Boxer Movement, there was a revolutionary organization of young women from the north known as the "Red Lantern." A popular song at the time went, "Men practice the Boxer Fists, women practice the Red Lantern." They wore red clothes, red hats, carried red lanterns, and wielded red guns. They fought on the front lines and eliminated traitors from the rear, displaying the revolutionary heroism of the Chinese people in their struggle against imperialism and feudalism.

The heroic daughters of the "Red Lantern" were genuine revolutionaries. They proudly declared, "Women do not comb their hair, to cut off the heads of foreigners; women do not bind their feet, to kill all foreigners and laugh heartily." At that time, not combing one's hair and not binding one's feet were considered "great crimes." They dared to rebel, defying all "family rules" and "national laws." They took up red knives to cut off the heads of foreigners, ransacked the homes of corrupt officials and large landlords, and walked proudly through the streets. The revolutionary spirit of the "Red Lantern" is eternal and will last forever. The daughters of the Red Lantern made immortal contributions in the struggle against imperialism and feudalism, writing a glorious chapter in modern Chinese history.

How to view the Boxer Movement, how to view the "Red Lantern," and what attitude to take towards their revolutionary actions of opposing imperialism and feudalism—this is the touchstone for distinguishing true revolutionaries from false ones, revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries.

All proletarian revolutionaries have always enthusiastically supported and praised this great revolutionary movement. Our most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao has highly praised the Boxer Movement and the revolutionary spirit of the heroic daughters of the "Red Lantern." Chairman Mao pointed out that the Boxer War "demonstrated the Chinese people's indomitable spirit of resistance against imperialism and its running dogs," showing that "our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the death with our enemies, the determination to restore our lost lands on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand among the nations of the world."

All reactionaries, both past and present, domestic and foreign, have always been extremely hostile, slandering, and vilifying revolutionary mass movements. This is because they are the targets of these revolutionary movements. The Boxer Movement aimed to overthrow imperialism and feudalism, so the imperialist invaders, such as the commander of the imperialist troops, Waldseemüller, and the head of American imperialism, Acheson, attacked the Boxer Movement. The landlord leaders, Guangxu and Zhenfei, also attacked the Boxer Movement. All the scholars in the service of the landlords and the bourgeoisie also attacked the Boxer Movement. On this issue, the number one capitalist-roaders within the Party also exposed his counter-revolutionary face. This Chinese Khrushchev, along with these Chinese, foreign, domestic, and international ghosts and snakes, sang in unison to slander the Boxer Movement and the "Red Lantern." He joined Waldseemüller and Acheson in attacking the Boxer Movement, praising a thoroughly treacherous film, "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty," which opposes the Chinese revolution and insults the revolutionary masses. He slandered the Boxer Movement and hated the fearless Red Lantern daughters.

This Chinese Khrushchev's hatred for the Boxer Movement and the revolutionary youngsters of that time is not accidental. Because the revolutionary youngsters of the "Red Lantern" firmly opposed imperialism, while this Chinese Khrushchev was afraid of imperialism, worshipped imperialism, and was close to imperialism; because the revolutionary youngsters of the "Red Lantern" fought to the end with uncompromising revolutionary spirit, while this Chinese Khrushchev advocated bourgeois reformism, beautified bourgeois democracy, and attempted to restore capitalism in China. More than seventy years ago, the revolutionary actions of the "Red Lantern" youngsters had already frightened this Chinese Khrushchev, hurting his heart, so he quickly jumped out and joined Acheson and others to attack the Boxer Movement.

Looking at his past, we can know his present. This Chinese Khrushchev's hatred for historical revolutionary mass movements inevitably led him to brutally suppress revolutionary mass movements and besiege revolutionary factions during this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, attempting to protect himself and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists.

When this Chinese Khrushchev put forward this bourgeois reactionary line, the revolutionary Red Guards and proletarian revolutionaries did not succumb to or be frightened by the white terror. Instead, they launched a heroic struggle. They inherited and carried forward the revolutionary spirit of the "Red Lantern," holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and vowing to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They smashed the repeated frenzied counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line. In the fierce class struggle, they united and implemented revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations, seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Even more gratifying is that they finally exposed this Chinese Khrushchev. The merits of the revolutionary youngsters in the Cultural Revolution are indelible. Their direction of struggle has always been correct.

However, class struggle is complex. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are not reconciled. Currently, these people are using various tricks to smear the faces of the revolutionary youngsters, framing them with various "false" charges; or they beat some and pull some, attempting to eat away at the revolutionary youngsters piece by piece. Some capitalist-roaders within the Party are also colluding with conservative forces, rising from the ashes, suppressing the proletarian revolutionaries, and attempting to counter-attack. Some people, not knowing the truth, also blindly follow them to attack the revolutionary youngsters. We must point out: how to view the revolutionary youngsters, how to view the proletarian revolutionaries, is a matter of principle, a matter of stance. Whoever denies the revolutionary youngsters is denying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; whoever attacks the revolutionary youngsters is attacking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary youngsters will inevitably have this or that flaw and error in this great revolution, but these are not difficult to overcome, and in fact, many flaws and errors have already been overcome. Currently, if anyone wants to seize upon the flaws and errors of the revolutionary youngsters to destroy them, the result will be very unpleasant.

The revolutionary situation is excellent, and the proletarian revolutionary line is achieving victory after victory. The bourgeois reactionary line is on its last legs, gasping for breath. Revolutionary youngsters, we must further carry forward the revolutionary spirit of rebellion, pursue victory, continue to expose the enemy's various new tricks, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to struggle, dare to make revolution, and make new contributions to the cause of proletarian revolution!

    赞“红灯照”
    《文汇报》四月十四日社论
    在威震中外的义和团运动中，有一支北方女青年的革命组织，名叫“红灯照”。当时流传的歌谣说，“男练义和拳，女练红灯照”。她们着红衣，戴红帽，提红灯，拿红枪，前方作战，后方除奸，表现了中华儿女反帝、反封建的革命英雄气概。
    “红灯照”的英雄女儿们是响当当的革命造反派。她们自豪地说：“妇女不梳头，砍去洋人头；妇女不裹足，杀尽洋人笑呵呵。”“不梳头”、“不裹足”，这在当时是被视为“大逆不道”的。她们就是敢于造反，管它什么“家规”、什么“国法”，统统不在话下。她们拿起红刀砍了洋人的头，抄了贪官污吏、大地主的家，在大街上威风凛凛地行走着。“红灯照”的革命造反精神，千秋不灭，万古长存。红灯女儿在反帝反封建的斗争中立下了不朽的功勋，在中国近代史上写下了光辉的一页。
    如何对待义和团运动，如何对待“红灯照”，对他们大造帝国主义的反、大造封建主义的反的革命行动，采取什么态度，这是检验真革命和假革命、革命和反革命的试金石。
    一切无产阶级革命派，总是满腔热情地支持、歌颂这个伟大的革命运动的。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席高度评价了义和团运动，高度评价了“红灯照”英雄女儿们的革命造反精神。毛主席指出义和团战争“表现了中国人民不甘屈服于帝国主义及其走狗的顽强的反抗精神”，表现了“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力”。
    古今中外一切反动派，总是极端仇视、诽谤、污蔑革命的群众运动。因为他们就是革命运动的革命对象。义和团要革帝国主义、封建主义的命，于是帝国主义侵略军头目瓦德西攻击义和团，美帝国主义头目艾奇逊攻击义和团，地主头子光绪、珍妃攻击义和团，一切地主、资产阶级的御用学者也攻击义和团。在这个问题上，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派也暴露了他的反革命面目。中国的赫鲁晓夫也和这些中国的、外国的、土的、洋的牛鬼蛇神一个鼻孔出气，参加污蔑义和团、“红灯照”的合唱队。他同瓦德西、艾奇逊唱一个调子，为一部反对中国革命、侮辱革命群众的彻底的卖国主义影片《清宫秘史》拍手叫好，污蔑义和团，仇视革命的、天不怕地不怕的红灯女儿。
    这个中国的赫鲁晓夫那样仇视义和团运动，那样仇视当时的革命小将，决不是偶然的。因为“红灯照”的革命小将坚决反帝，而这个中国的赫鲁晓夫则是恐帝、崇帝、亲帝；因为“红灯照”的革命小将以毫不妥协的革命精神一反到底，而这个中国的赫鲁晓夫却鼓吹资产阶级改良主义，美化资产阶级民主主义，妄图在中国实行资本主义复辟。七十多年前“红灯照”革命小将的革命行动，已经吓破了这个中国的赫鲁晓夫的胆，刺痛了他的心，于是乎，他就赶紧跳出来，和艾奇逊之流一起攻击义和团运动。
    看他的过去，就能知道他的现在。这个中国的赫鲁晓夫如此仇视历史上的革命群众运动，也就必然要在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中，疯狂地镇压革命群众运动，围剿革命派，妄图保护他自己和一小撮反革命修正主义分子滑过去。
    革命的红卫兵，无产阶级革命派，当中国的赫鲁晓夫抛出这条资产阶级反动路线时，并没有被白色恐怖所屈服，所吓倒，而是展开了英勇的斗争。他们继承和发扬了“红灯照”的革命造反精神，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，誓死捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线一次又一次的疯狂反扑。他们在轰轰烈烈的阶级大搏斗中联合起来，实行革命的“三结合”，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里的权夺了过来。更大快人心的是，他们终于把这个中国的赫鲁晓夫揪了出来。革命小将在文化大革命中立下的功勋，是不可磨灭的。他们的斗争大方向始终是正确的。
    但是，阶级斗争是复杂的。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派并不死心。当前，这些家伙正在玩弄各种手法，往革命小将脸上抹黑，把各种“莫须有”的罪名，强加到革命小将头上；或者打一批，拉一批，妄图分片把革命小将“吃”掉。有的党内走资本主义道路当权派还和保守势力勾结起来，死灰复燃，镇压无产阶级革命派，妄图进行反夺权。有的人不明真相，也糊里糊涂跟着他们一起攻击革命小将。我们必须指出：如何对待革命小将，如何对待无产阶级革命派，这是一个原则问题，一个立场问题。谁若否定革命小将，便是否定无产阶级文化大革命；谁若打击革命小将，便是打击无产阶级文化大革命。革命小将在这场大革命中，难免会有这样那样的缺点、错误，这是不难克服的，实际上有不少缺点、错误已经得到了克服。当前，谁如果想抓住革命小将的一些缺点、错误，来整垮革命小将，其结果必定是很不美妙的。
    革命形势大好，无产阶级革命路线正在取得节节胜利，资产阶级反动路线已日薄西山，气息奄奄。革命小将们，我们要进一步发扬革命造反精神，乘胜追击，继续识破敌人的各种新的阴谋诡计，敢想，敢说，敢干，敢斗争，敢革命，为无产阶级革命事业作出新的贡献！
