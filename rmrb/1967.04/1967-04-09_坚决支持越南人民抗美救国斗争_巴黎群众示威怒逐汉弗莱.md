U.S. Vice President Humphrey Faced with Angry Protests in Paris

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Paris on the 8th, U.S. Vice President Humphrey, who has been active in various countries in Western Europe, arrived in Paris on the 7th amidst the angry protests and shouts of "Yankee—murderer!" and "Humphrey, go back!" from the French people.

Since March 27, Humphrey has faced anti-U.S. aggression in Vietnam protests and demonstrations in Rome, London, Bonn, and West Berlin.

On the 7th, about one hundred Paris residents held a demonstration in front of the airport building when Humphrey arrived in Paris. The frightened Humphrey took a detour from the airport into the city, but he still encountered many demonstrators along the way, and some threw stones and paint at his car. In the afternoon, when Humphrey went to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, several thousand people held a protest demonstration on the streets he passed through. Among the demonstrators were several hundred members of progressive organizations such as the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) and the French Communist Youth League (Marxist-Leninist). They held banners reading "Stop U.S. Aggression" and shouted slogans such as "Humphrey—murderer!" and "Victory to the National Liberation Front (of South Vietnam)!"

The leaflets distributed by these organizations stated: "Marxist-Leninists firmly support the struggle of the Vietnamese people and call on the true friends of the Vietnamese people to join the fight against the world's number one enemy, U.S. imperialism."

The leaflets also condemned the heads of the Soviet revisionist clique, such as Brezhnev and Kosygin, and the French revisionist clique, such as Roger, for using the pretext of aiding the Vietnamese people to collaborate with the U.S. in promoting the "peace talks" deception.

When Humphrey went to the Place de la Concorde to lay a wreath at the statue of Washington, he again encountered a protest demonstration. Moreover, the pedestal of the statue had already been written on with red paint with slogans protesting U.S. aggression in Vietnam. Including many Americans, the angry demonstrators burned an American flag on the spot. After throwing down the wreath, Humphrey hurriedly fled, and his escort motorcade only caught up with him later.

The Paris authorities dispatched a large number of police to suppress the demonstrators. They wielded batons, dispersed the demonstrators, and arrested more than one hundred and sixty people in several demonstrations on the 7th.

Amidst the protests, Humphrey left Paris by plane today to go to Brussels for activities.

    坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争
    巴黎群众示威怒逐汉弗莱
    据新华社巴黎八日电  在西欧各国活动的美国副总统汉弗莱，七日在法国人民愤怒示威和高呼“美国佬——杀人犯”、“汉弗莱滚回去”的口号声中到达巴黎。
    汉弗莱从三月二十七日到西欧活动以来，一路在罗马、伦敦、波恩和西柏林都遇到反对美国侵略越南的抗议示威。
    一百名巴黎居民七日在汉弗莱到达巴黎时在机场大厦前举行示威。胆战心惊的汉弗莱绕道从机场进入市区，但是一路上仍然遇到不少示威群众，并有人向他的汽车投掷石块和油漆。下午，在汉弗莱前往法国无名英雄墓献花圈时，几千人在汉弗莱经过的大街上举行抗议示威。示威群众中有几百人是法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）和法国共产主义青年联盟（马克思列宁主义）等进步组织的成员，他们拿着“制止美国侵略”的横幅标语，并且高呼“汉弗莱——杀人犯”、“（越南南方）民族解放阵线必胜”等口号。
    这些组织散发的传单说：“马克思列宁主义者坚决支持越南人民的斗争，并且号召越南人民真正的朋友起来同世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义斗争。”
    传单还谴责苏修领导集团头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金等和法国修正主义集团的罗歇等人，在援助越南人民的幌子下，配合美国推行“和谈”骗局。
    在汉弗莱到耶纳广场向华盛顿像献花圈时，在那里又遇到抗议示威。而且，雕像的石座上早就被人用红漆写上抗议美国侵略越南的标语。包括许多美国人在内的愤怒的示威群众，当场烧毁了一面美国星条旗。汉弗莱扔下花圈后慌忙溜走，连护送他的摩托车队也到后来才追上他。
    巴黎当局出动了大批警察镇压示威群众，他们挥舞警棍，驱散示威群众，并且在七日的几起示威中逮捕了一百六十多人。
    汉弗莱今天在一片抗议声中，乘飞机离巴黎去布鲁塞尔活动。
