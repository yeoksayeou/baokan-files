The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, is an unprecedented feat in the history of the international communist movement and human history.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "The great proletarian cultural revolution is to eliminate bourgeois ideology, establish proletarian ideology, transform people's souls, realize the ideological transformation of people, uproot the roots of revisionism, and consolidate and develop the socialist system."

Throughout the great proletarian cultural revolution, the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line has been ongoing. In terms of ideology, it is the struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, the struggle between "public" and "private." In this struggle, we, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, have achieved great victories. In the current battle to launch a comprehensive offensive against the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party, we must further break down the "private" and establish the "public." To do this, the key is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially to focus on the "Three Articles," thoroughly criticize the various revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party, and especially to severely criticize "Cultivation."

The brilliant "Three Articles" are a treasure trove of Marxism-Leninism, the source of strength for the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, the most powerful weapon for transforming our souls, and a family heirloom to ensure that the people's mountains and rivers remain unchanged in color.

The reactionary "Cultivation," on the other hand, is a thoroughly rotten revisionist poisonous weed, a reactionary capitalist business manual, an opium that poisons people's souls, and the general program for China's Khrushchev to seize the party, the army, and political power, and conspire to restore capitalism.

The red thread running through the "Three Articles" is the character "public." The "Three Articles" teach us to completely dedicate ourselves to liberating the people and to work thoroughly for the people's interests, to have a spirit of selflessness and dedication. This is the proletarian worldview of serving the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly. Only those who possess the proletarian worldview are noble, pure, moral, free from vulgar interests, and beneficial to the people. Only such people can have the fearless revolutionary spirit and shoulder the responsibility of transforming the world.

The black line running through the entire book of "Cultivation" is the character "private." "Cultivation" subtly advocates bourgeois individualism, peddles the philosophy of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," and promotes personal ambitions to gain fame and status. This is the bourgeois view of life that says "if you don't look out for yourself, heaven and earth will destroy you." Those who hold such a view of life will inevitably be filled with vulgar interests, selfish, and have a filthy soul. Such people will surely fear and oppose the revolution, becoming obstacles to the revolution.

Only by following the teachings of the "Three Articles" can we be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We can resolutely execute and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao represents the most fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people and the direction of historical development. This is the greatest "public." If we do not eliminate the "private" and establish the proletarian worldview of wholeheartedly serving the public, we will never be able to truly understand and execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The reactionary "Cultivation" wants people to be captives of the bourgeois reactionary line. It does everything it can to suppress the revolutionary masses' spirit of initiative and tries to put a spiritual shackle around people's necks. "Cultivation" itself is the theoretical and ideological foundation of the bourgeois reactionary line. The "private" character it advocates is the ideological root of the bourgeois reactionary line. The bourgeois reactionary line represents the interests of the bourgeoisie; its goal is to restore capitalism in China and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. This is the greatest "private."

Only by following the teachings of the "Three Articles" and striving to establish the proletarian worldview of wholeheartedly serving the public can we better participate in the real class struggle, care about national affairs, and promote the development of the revolutionary cause. In this way, before the revolution's victory, we can seize power more quickly; after seizing power, we can better consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletariat must overthrow the bourgeois political power and consolidate its own power, doing ideological work, ultimately breaking down the "private" character, overthrowing private ownership; establishing the "public" character, and building the socialist and communist public ownership system.

The reactionary "Cultivation," on the other hand, wants people to detach themselves from the real class struggle, the revolution, and political struggle. It wants people to forget the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power, forget the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and confine themselves to the narrow circle of "me," entangled in personal gains and losses. Once people are poisoned by it, they will become politically indifferent, lose their way, and even degenerate into counter-revolutionary revisionists. In this way, a small handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party can do as they please and may seize the power of the proletariat, carrying out counter-revolutionary restoration.

The brilliant "Three Articles" are the motto of our revolutionary faction of the proletariat, a compulsory course for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. By studying the "Three Articles" well, one can have a firm stand, clear distinctions between love and hate, be loyal and devoted, and wholeheartedly serve the public; one can cultivate and nurture millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Only in this way can we ensure that our country continues to advance victoriously along the course charted by our great helmsman Chairman Mao, ensure that our country remains unchanged in color for generations to come, and achieve the ideal of communism.

The reactionary "Cultivation" is the program for the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party and a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists to restore capitalism. It aims to cultivate successors to the bourgeoisie. If one cultivates oneself according to this book, one will only become more "cultivated" and more revisionist. In this way, our party will degenerate into a revisionist party, the dictatorship of the proletariat will degenerate into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and our country will change color!

From this, it can be seen that whether or not to study the "Three Articles" and whether or not to criticize "Cultivation" is a question of whether or not to make a revolution, a question of whether to use the proletarian worldview to transform the world or the bourgeois worldview to transform the world, a question of whether to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat or carry out the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, this is a fundamental issue concerning whether our country will take the socialist path or the capitalist path, and whether the future and destiny of our country and the world revolution are at stake.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." "Errors must be criticized, and poisonous weeds must be fought against." Let us raise the banner of revolutionary criticism of the proletariat, use the "Three Articles" as a weapon of thought, severely criticize the typical work of revisionism "Cultivation," thoroughly criticize all exploitative class ideologies, and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Let the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy all positions!

Down with the revisionist work "Cultivation"!

Long live the "Three Articles"! Ten thousand years of the "Three Articles"!

    大学“老三篇”狠狠批《修养》
    《北京日报》四月九日社论
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是国际共产主义运动史上和人类历史上空前未有的壮举。
    林彪同志说：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是要消灭资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级思想，改造人的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化，挖掉修正主义根子，巩固和发展社会主义制度。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，始终贯穿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的斗争。从思想上来说，也就是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的斗争，就是
  “公”和“私”的斗争。在这个斗争中，我们无产阶级革命派已经取得了伟大的胜利。在当前向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派展开总攻击的战斗中，我们必须进一步大破“私”字，大立“公”字。要这样做，关键在于活学活用毛主席著作，特别是要大学“老三篇”，彻底批判中国的赫鲁晓夫、党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的种种修正主义谬论，特别是要狠狠批《修养》。
    光辉的“老三篇”，是金光闪闪的马克思列宁主义宝书，是无产阶级革命派力量的源泉，是我们改造灵魂的最锐利的武器，是永保人民江山不变颜色的传家宝。
    反动的《修养》，则是腐烂透顶的修正主义的大毒草，是一本反动的资产阶级的生意经，是毒害人们灵魂的鸦片，是中国的赫鲁晓夫篡党、篡军、篡政，阴谋复辟资本主义的总纲领。
    贯穿“老三篇”的一根红线，是一个“公”字。“老三篇”教导我们，要完全地为着解放人民，彻底地为人民利益工作，要有毫不利己专门利人的精神。这就是全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的无产阶级世界观。只有具有无产阶级世界观的人，才是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。只有这样的人，才能具有大无畏的革命精神，才能担当起改造世界的重任。
    贯穿《修养》全书的一条黑线，是一个“私”字。《修养》转弯抹角地提倡资产阶级个人主义，贩卖“吃小亏，占大便宜”的市侩哲学，鼓吹成名成家、往上爬的个人野心。这就是“人不为己，天诛地灭”的资产阶级人生观。具有这种人生观的人，就一定是一个充满低级趣味的人，一个自私自利的人，一个灵魂肮脏的人。这样的人，必然害怕革命，反对革命，成为革命的绊脚石。
    我们只有遵循“老三篇”的教导，才能无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，才能坚决执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，代表最广大人民群众的最根本利益，代表历史发展的方向，这是最大的“公”。如果我们不破除“私”字，不树立一心为公的无产阶级世界观，就根本不可能很好地理解和执行毛主席的革命路线。
    反动的《修养》，要人们做资产阶级反动路线的俘虏。它千方百计地扼杀革命群众的首创精神，力图在人们脖子上套上一副精神枷锁。《修养》本身，就是资产阶级反动路线的理论基础和思想基础。它所宣扬的剥削阶级的“私”字，就是资产阶级反动路线产生的思想根源。资产阶级反动路线所代表的，是资产阶级的利益；它的目的，就是要在中国复辟资本主义，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。这是最大的“私”。
    我们只有遵循“老三篇”的教导，努力树立一心为公的无产阶级世界观，才能更好地参加现实的阶级斗争，关心国家大事，推进革命事业的发展。这样，在革命胜利以前，就能更快地夺取政权；在取得政权以后，就能更好地巩固无产阶级专政。无产阶级要推翻资产阶级政权和巩固自己的政权，都要做意识形态方面的工作，归根结底，就是要大破“私”字，打倒私有制；大立“公”字，建立社会主义、共产主义的公有制。
    反动的《修养》，则要人们脱离现实的阶级斗争，脱离革命，脱离政治斗争，要人们忘掉革命的根本问题是政权问题，忘掉无产阶级专政问题，而局限于“我”字的狭小圈子里，纠缠于一己得失之中。一旦人们中了它的毒，就会变成不关心政治、迷失方向的政治庸人，甚至会堕落成为反革命修正主义分子。这样，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派就可以为所欲为，就可能篡夺无产阶级的政权，搞反革命复辟。
    光辉的“老三篇”，是我们无产阶级革命派的座右铭，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的必修课。学好了“老三篇”，就能立场坚定，爱憎分明，忠心耿耿，一心为公；就能培养、造就千千万万的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。只有这样，才能保证我们的国家永远沿着我们伟大的舵手毛主席所指引的航道胜利前进，才能保证我们的国家千秋万代永不变色，才能达到共产主义的理想境界。
    反动的《修养》，是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子复辟资本主义的纲领。它要培养的是资产阶级的接班人。如果按照这本书去“修养”，只能越养越“修”，越修养越成为修正主义。这样，我们的党就会蜕变为修正主义的党，无产阶级专政就会蜕变为资产阶级专政，我们的国家就会改变颜色！
    由此可见，学不学“老三篇”，批不批《修养》，是要不要革命的问题，是用无产阶级世界观改造世界还是用资产阶级世界观改造世界的问题，是巩固无产阶级专政还是实行资本主义复辟的问题。因此，这是关系到我国走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的问题，是关系到我国和世界革命前途和命运的根本问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。“有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。”让我们高举无产阶级的革命的批判旗帜，把“老三篇”当作思想武器，狠狠批判典型的修正主义代表作《修养》，大破一切剥削阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，让伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想永远占领一切阵地！
    打倒修正主义代表作《修养》！
    “老三篇”万岁！万万岁！
