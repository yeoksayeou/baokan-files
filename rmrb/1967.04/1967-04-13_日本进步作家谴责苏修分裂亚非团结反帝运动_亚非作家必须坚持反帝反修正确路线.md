Japanese progressive writers Ema Shū and Toyoda Masako on the 8th spoke to a Chinese reporter, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's plot to hold a fake "Third Asian-African Writers' Conference" in Beirut. They firmly support the statement issued by the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau on March 21st and support the Third Asian-African Writers' Conference, which will be successfully held in Beijing this year.

Ema and Toyoda pointed out that the fake "Third Asian-African Writers' Conference" in Beirut is a blatant plot by Soviet modern revisionists to hold a split meeting. It is a product of U.S.-Soviet cooperation, serving the U.S. imperialists' suppression of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples' struggle for national liberation, the expansion of the Vietnam War, and the conspiracy to push for "peace talks" on the Vietnam issue.

Ema and Toyoda emphasized that the Third Asian-African Writers' Conference, scheduled to be held in Beijing this year, has received the sincere support of writers from dozens of Asian and African countries and regions. This conference will be the only legitimate and genuine gathering of Asian-African writers. They expressed great expectations for this conference.

Ema and Toyoda also emphasized that to adhere to the correct line of the Asian-African writers' movement, it is necessary to seriously study and widely propagate Mao Zedong Thought. They believe that true Asian-African writers should adhere to the correct line of anti-imperialism, anti-revisionism, and support the liberation struggles of the peoples of Asian and African countries. They must closely combine literary and artistic activities with political struggles, unifying them. They said that Lu Xun, the leader of China's cultural revolution, set a brilliant example for progressive writers engaged in the struggle for national liberation.

According to a report from the East News Agency, the Executive Committee of the Japanese Preparatory Committee for the Asian-African Writers' Conference held a meeting in Tokyo on April 3rd, condemning the farce of the fake "Third Asian-African Writers' Conference" staged by Soviet modern revisionists in Beirut in late March.

The Executive Committee sent a telegram to the Secretariat of the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau in Beijing, reaffirming its stance: the fake "Third Asian-African Writers' Conference" was illegally convened in Beirut, and strongly condemning the split activities of the Soviet revisionists and their followers.

On April 6th, Chairman Shiraishi Hitoshi of the Japanese Preparatory Committee for the Asian-African Writers' Conference and famous critic, Committee member Matsuoka Yōko, spoke to a reporter from the East News Agency, saying: "We will not allow the Beirut Conference to use the name of the 'Third Asian-African Writers' Conference,' because it is indeed a split conference." Shiraishi pointed out that the purpose of the Beirut Conference is to destroy the unity of Asian-African writers, which is beneficial to U.S. imperialism.

He also said: "We Japanese writers support the Third Asian-African Writers' Conference to be held in China this year and will make every effort for the success of the conference. We firmly believe that, through the joint efforts of all Asian-African writers, the conference will definitely be successful."

Committee member and famous Japanese critic Matsuoka Yōko condemned the Beirut Conference, saying: "Soviet modern revisionists are doing everything they can to destroy the fighting unity of Asian-African writers, attempting to extinguish the flames of the national liberation struggles of the Asian and African peoples."

    日本进步作家谴责苏修分裂亚非团结反帝运动
    亚非作家必须坚持反帝反修正确路线
    新华社东京电　日本进步作家江马修和丰田正子八日向中国记者发表谈话，强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团策划的贝鲁特伪“第三届亚非作家大会”，坚决拥护亚非作家常设局三月二十一日发表的重要声明，支持今年将在北京胜利召开的第三届亚非作家大会。
    江马和丰田指出，贝鲁特伪“第三届亚非作家大会”是苏联现代修正主义者明目张胆地策划的一次分裂会议，是美苏合作的产物，是为美帝国主义镇压亚非拉人民争取民族解放斗争、扩大侵略越南战争和在越南问题上搞“和谈”阴谋而效劳的。
    江马和丰田强调指出，预定今年在北京举行的第三届亚非作家大会得到了几十个亚非国家和地区的作家们的衷心支持。这次大会将是唯一合法的、真正的亚非作家的集会。他们表示对这次大会寄予很大的期望。
    江马和丰田还强调说，为了坚持亚非作家运动的正确路线，必须认真学习和广泛传播毛泽东思想。他们认为，真正的亚非作家应当坚持反帝、反修和支持亚非各国人民解放斗争这一正确路线，必须把文学艺术活动同政治斗争密切地结合起来、统一起来。他们说，中国文化革命的主将鲁迅为正在从事争取民族解放斗争的进步作家树立了光辉榜样。
    新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道，亚非作家会议日本协议委员会执行委员会四月三日在东京举行会议，谴责苏联现代修正主义者操纵的三月下旬在贝鲁特上演的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”丑剧。
    执行委员会打电报给设在北京的亚非作家常设局执行书记处重申了它的立场：伪“第三届亚非作家大会”是在贝鲁特非法召开的，强烈谴责苏修及其追随者的分裂活动。
    亚非作家会议日本协议委员会主席白石凡和著名评论家、委员会委员松冈洋子四月六日对东方通讯社记者发表谈话说：“我们决不允许贝鲁特大会利用‘第三届亚非作家大会’的名义，因为它的确是一次分裂的大会。”白石凡指出，贝鲁特大会的目的在于破坏亚非作家的团结，它有利于美帝国主义。
    他还说：“我们日本作家支持今年在中国举行第三届亚非作家大会，并将为大会的成功尽最大的努力。我们坚信，由于全体亚非作家的共同努力，大会定将成功。”
    执行委员会委员、日本著名评论家松冈洋子谴责贝鲁特大会说：“苏联现代修正主义千方百计破坏亚非作家的战斗团结，企图扑灭亚非人民民族解放斗争的火焰。”
