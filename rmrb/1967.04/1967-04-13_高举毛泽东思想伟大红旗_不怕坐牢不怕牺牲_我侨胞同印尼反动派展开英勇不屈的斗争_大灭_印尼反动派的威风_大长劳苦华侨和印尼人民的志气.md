The broad masses of toiling overseas Chinese and oppressed overseas Chinese of all strata in Indonesia, in the face of the new wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese persecution launched by the right-wing military fascist regime, have taken up the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, defended themselves, and waged a resolute struggle against persecution and expropriation.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought guides and inspires the struggle of the broad masses of toiling overseas Chinese in Indonesia against persecution. This struggle not only deals a heavy blow to the shameful conspiracy of the Indonesian reactionaries in collusion with imperialism and modern revisionism to oppose China, boosts the revolutionary spirit of the Indonesian people, but also greatly inspires the broad revolutionary masses in the motherland who are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The struggle of the broad masses of toiling overseas Chinese in Indonesia against persecution extends from North Sumatra in the west to East Java in the east. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. In North Sumatra, many oppressed overseas Chinese spontaneously united to wage self-defense struggles. In West Java, where the reactionaries' arrogance is rampant, due to the resolute struggle of the overseas Chinese, the Indonesian reactionary authorities were forced to release some innocent overseas Chinese who had been arrested. In various places in East Java, the broad masses of toiling overseas Chinese resolutely resisted the cruel persecution and plunder by the Indonesian reactionary authorities. In places like Surabaya, Cirebon, Anru, Pungkur, Malang, Mojokerto, and Wondosobo in East Java, many overseas Chinese were forced to rise up against the imposition of high "poll taxes" and the "transfer" of the shops they operated. As a result, the Indonesian reactionary authorities had to repeatedly extend the deadline for paying the "poll tax," and the illegal activities of forcibly "transferring" shops were mostly unsuccessful. The broad masses of toiling overseas Chinese, in their struggle against persecution, fear neither beatings, imprisonment, nor sacrifice. They have produced one heroic collective after another, thoroughly crushing the arrogance of the Indonesian reactionaries and greatly boosting the morale of the toiling overseas Chinese and the revolutionary people of Indonesia.

In the struggle against persecution and expropriation, the broad masses of toiling overseas Chinese have closely united with overseas Chinese of all strata who have suffered. They remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "all reactionaries are paper tigers," dare to struggle, and persist in struggle, achieving one victory after another. In many places, the suffering overseas Chinese shouted slogans, sang revolutionary songs, and held demonstrations to oppose the unreasonable persecution by the Indonesian reactionaries. In Cirebon, East Java, the persecuted overseas Chinese launched large-scale struggles continuously. On March 3 of this year, more than a thousand overseas Chinese in Cirebon marched to the police station in groups, demanding the release of 33 overseas Chinese who had been illegally arrested. In late March, the right-wing reactionary authorities in Cirebon arrested more than 60 overseas Chinese and forced one toiling overseas Chinese to death, sparking strong protests from the local overseas Chinese. The right-wing authorities sent armed police and soldiers to open fire and suppress the protests, resulting in a serious bloodshed incident. Hundreds of overseas Chinese stood tall and proud in the face of the enemy's bayonets and the crazy gunfire, loudly reciting Chairman Mao's quotations and persisted in struggle for three hours, finally forcing the enemy to retreat. In early February, the overseas Chinese in Mojokerto held a funeral procession for an overseas Chinese who had been forced to death by the Indonesian reactionary authorities for not paying the "poll tax." Thousands of overseas Chinese and Indonesian people spontaneously gathered, forming a long procession that marched through the city to demonstrate. On March 11, more than 4,000 overseas Chinese in Malang held a funeral procession for an overseas Chinese who had been forced to death by the reactionary authorities. The procession was three miles long. The Indonesian reactionary authorities sent a large number of armed police and soldiers to open fire and suppress the procession. The mourners were greatly enraged and continued to move forward with the hearse. A young overseas Chinese had his leg shot by a reactionary soldier's bullet, bleeding profusely, but he fearlessly shouted in the procession, "Don't be afraid, keep moving forward!" Seeing that their suppression was ineffective, the Indonesian reactionary military police had to retreat in disgrace, changing to a large number of armored cars and police cars to monitor the route.

In the city of Wondosobo, East Java, the Indonesian reactionary authorities, in order to implement anti-China and anti-Chinese laws, crazily arrested overseas Chinese and plundered their property. On April 6, they shamelessly opened fire, killing the overseas Chinese Huang Jianmin and injuring Yang Jingrong, Chen Yongzhen, and others, causing a serious bloodshed incident. More than 200 overseas Chinese, enraged by the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionaries, carried the body of Huang Jianmin to the front of the Wondosobo base command headquarters, together with more than 100 family members of overseas Chinese, angrily denouncing the murderous crimes of the Indonesian reactionary military government. Dozens of reactionary soldiers were so frightened that they lost their composure and had to have the police represent them to "guarantee" the handling of the aftermath and to "ensure" the personal safety of the overseas Chinese.

Many persecuted overseas Chinese, in their struggle against the Indonesian reactionary authorities, actively applied Chairman Mao's works, gaining immense strength. In the "refugee camp" of the Chinese Middle School in Medan, Indonesian thugs rampantly destroyed and plundered the living supplies of the overseas Chinese, even openly firing at the unarmed refugees. The refugees remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "If others do not offend me, I do not offend them; if others offend me, I must offend them." They were filled with strength, and more than 200 refugees charged at the thugs, frightening them into a panicked retreat. Once, a Chinese barber and a few other overseas Chinese were surrounded by a group of thugs. The rain of stones thrown by the thugs injured them. These compatriots remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "People inevitably die, but dying for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai." They immediately gained courage and strength and resolutely struggled, finally driving away the thugs. The refugees said: The Indonesian reactionaries bully us like this, we must seriously deal with them. It is precisely because the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought guides us that we see clearly, become more courageous and stronger in the struggle, and can be invincible.

The just struggle of the Indonesian overseas Chinese against persecution and expropriation has won the sympathy of the broad masses of the Indonesian people and boosted their fighting spirit. In West Java, some Indonesian village heads who were dissatisfied with the right-wing authorities' unreasonable arrests of overseas Chinese resigned in protest. In some places, Indonesian people spontaneously joined the ranks of the overseas Chinese demonstrations, opposing the cruel persecution of the overseas Chinese by the Indonesian reactionary authorities.

The Chinese government and people are closely watching the new wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese persecution launched by the right-wing fascist regime in Indonesia. The broad revolutionary masses in the motherland firmly support and deeply care about the unyielding struggle of the Indonesian overseas Chinese. People emphasize that although the Indonesian reactionaries look frightening, they actually have no formidable power. The just struggle of the Indonesian overseas Chinese against persecution will once again prove the unshakable truth pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers.... The truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." The Indonesian reactionary government, insisting on its own way, intensifying anti-China and anti-Chinese actions, will inevitably reap what it has sown.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗　不怕坐牢不怕牺牲
    我侨胞同印尼反动派展开英勇不屈的斗争
    大灭 印尼反动派的威风　大长劳苦华侨和印尼人民的志气
    新华社十二日讯　印度尼西亚广大劳苦华侨和各阶层受迫害的华侨，在印度尼西亚右派军人法西斯政权掀起新的反华排华浪潮中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，被迫自卫，展开了坚决的针锋相对的反迫害、反剥夺的正义斗争。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，指引和鼓舞着印尼广大劳苦华侨的反迫害斗争。这个斗争不仅沉重地打击了印尼反动派同帝国主义、现代修正主义合谋反华的可耻阴谋，鼓舞了印度尼西亚人民的革命斗志，并且对正在进行无产阶级文化大革命的祖国广大革命群众也是一个很大的鼓舞。
    印尼广大劳苦华侨的反迫害斗争，西至北苏门答腊，东至东爪哇，那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。在北苏门答腊，许多受害华侨自动团结起来展开自卫斗争。在反动气焰嚣张的西爪哇，由于华侨坚决斗争，迫使印尼反动当局不得不释放一些无辜被捕的华侨。在东爪哇各地，广大劳苦华侨坚决抵抗印尼反动当局的残酷迫害和掠夺。东爪哇的泗水、谏义里、安褥、庞越、玛琅、茉莉芬、文多禾梭等地，许多华侨被迫起来反对缴纳高额“人头税”，反对“移交”他们所经营的店面，结果，印尼反动当局不得不一再延长缴纳“人头税”的限期，强迫“移交”店面的非法活动也绝大部分未能得逞。广大劳苦华侨在反迫害斗争中，不怕挨打，不怕坐牢，不怕牺牲，出现了一个又一个的革命英雄集体，大灭了印尼反动派的威风，大长了劳苦华侨和印尼革命人民的志气。
    在反迫害、反剥夺的英勇斗争中，广大劳苦华侨同各阶层受害的华侨紧密地团结在一起，他们牢记伟大领袖毛主席关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的教导，敢于斗争，坚持斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利。许多地方的受害华侨高呼口号，高唱革命歌曲，举行示威游行，反对印尼反动派的无理迫害。在东爪哇的谏义里市，受迫害的华侨连续展开了大规模的斗争。今年三月三日，谏义里市有上千名华侨结队前往警察局，要求释放被非法逮捕的三十三名华侨。三月下旬，谏义里市右派反动当局又逮捕了六十多名华侨，并逼死一名劳苦华侨，激起了当地华侨的强烈抗议。右派当局出动武装军警开枪镇压，造成严重的流血事件。数百名华侨在敌人的刺刀面前，在疯狂的枪声中，昂首挺胸，高声朗诵毛主席语录，坚持斗争达三小时之久，终于迫使敌人撤退。今年二月初，茉莉芬的华侨为被印尼反动当局催缴“人头税”而逼死的一名华侨送葬，成千名华侨和印尼人民自动集合起来，组成了长长的行列在市区内游行示威。三月十一日，玛琅四千多名华侨为被反动当局逼死的一名华侨送葬，队伍长达三华里，印尼反动当局出动大批武装军警鸣枪镇压，送葬的人群大为激愤，他们继续开动柩车前进。一名华侨青年腿部被反动军人的枪弹击中，血流不止，但他毫不畏惧地在队伍里高呼：
  “不要怕，继续前进！”印尼反动军警见镇压无效，只得狼狈撤退，改由大队装甲车和警车沿途监视。
    在东爪哇西都文罗市，印尼反动当局为推行反华、排华法令，疯狂地逮捕华侨，劫掠华侨财产，并在四月六日肆无忌惮地开枪打死华侨黄健民、枪伤华侨杨荆荣、陈永振等人，造成严重的流血事件。被印尼反动派法西斯暴行激怒了的二百多名华侨，把黄健民的尸体抬到西都文罗市基地司令部门前，同一百多名华侨家属一起，愤怒控诉印尼反动军政当局的杀人罪行。数十名反动军人吓得丧魂落魄，只得由警察代表出面，
  “保证”处理善后和“保障”华侨的人身安全。
    许多被迫害的华侨在同印尼反动当局斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，增加了无比的力量。在棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”里，印尼暴徒大肆破坏和掠夺华侨的生活资料，甚至公然向手无寸铁的难侨开枪。难侨们想起了毛主席的教导：“人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人。”他们浑身充满了力量，二百多名难侨向暴徒冲过去，吓得暴徒心惊胆战，纷纷溃逃。有一次，一名华侨理发工人和另外几个华侨被一群暴徒包围，暴徒扔来的雨点般的石头打伤了他们。这几位侨胞想起毛主席的教导：人总是要死的，为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重。他们立刻增添了勇气和力量，坚决斗争，终于赶走了暴徒。难侨们说：印尼反动派如此欺负我们，我们一定要认真对付。正是由于伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引着我们，我们才心明眼亮，在斗争中更加勇敢，更加坚强，才能无往而不胜。
    印尼华侨反迫害、反剥夺的正义斗争，得到了广大印尼人民的同情，鼓舞了印尼人民的斗志。在西爪哇，有些担任村长的印尼人因为不满右派当局无理逮捕华侨，愤然辞职，表示抗议。有些地方的印尼人民还自动参加了华侨示威游行的行列，反对印尼反动当局对华侨的残酷迫害。
    我国政府和我国人民正密切注视着印尼右派法西斯政权掀起的新的反华排华浪潮。祖国广大革命群众对于印尼华侨英勇不屈的斗争，表示坚决的支持和极大的关怀。人们强调指出，印尼反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。印尼华侨反迫害的正义斗争，将再一次证明伟大领袖毛主席所指出的颠扑不破的真理：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。……真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”印尼反动政府一意孤行，加紧反华排华，必将自食其恶果。
