The Great Leader Chairman Mao says: "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question for revolution." The top capitalist-roader in the party is a time bomb hidden beside Chairman Mao, an enemy of the Chinese people. We must definitely overthrow him.

The top capitalist-roader in the party openly opposes Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. He advocates begging imperialism for "peace"; after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he vigorously promoted the idea that "the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution has changed to peaceful, parliamentary struggle." He also propagates the revisionist line of "three harmonies and one less," spreading the fallacy of capitulationism, willingly wanting to be a slave of American imperialism.

We broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have a deep hatred for the heinous crimes committed by imperialism in China. In 1939, the Japanese devils raided our Xigou, stealing countless cattle, sheep, livestock, grain, and money. Even more brutal was that they killed our class brothers. My younger sister was only eight years old when she was killed by the enemy. The great rivers and mountains of our motherland were ravaged beyond recognition. Such deep hatred, how can we forget! But the self-proclaimed "old revolutionary," the top capitalist-roader in the party, actually wants us to talk "peace" with imperialism. This is simply a pipe dream! The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. Under the wise leadership of Great Leader Chairman Mao, we organized, took up arms, and overthrew Japanese imperialism. We overthrew the American imperialists and their running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries. We will definitely overthrow the top capitalist-roader in the party now.

The top capitalist-roader in the party boasts about the "help" from imperialism, which is sheer nonsense. He talks about "peace" and "parliament" on the surface, but in reality, he surrenders to imperialism, betrays the country, and betrays the people. He is a thorough slave of imperialism, a great enemy of the Chinese people. With the enemy at hand, we must definitely overthrow him, making sure he never rises again!

In the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the top capitalist-roader in the party also opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xigou actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "organize" in 1943, being the first to form a mutual aid team. Later, we established agricultural, forestry, and livestock production cooperatives and people's communes, advancing on the path of collectivization, turning the poor old Xigou into a socialist new mountain village with "green mountains, cattle and sheep filling the valleys, turning five lacks into five haves, and bumper harvests every year." These are all great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. However, the top capitalist-roader in the party hates these achievements to the core, fears them to death, openly defies Chairman Mao's instructions, vigorously promotes "four freedoms and one contract," and advocates the development of rich peasant economy. Those few capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the party, following the orders of this top capitalist-roader in the party, eagerly oppose us in Xigou, speak ill of us, and try every means to strike us down, saying our collective economy is "ruined" and the land is "wasted," attempting to cut off our collective economy to achieve the restoration of capitalism.

Chairman Mao's words are deeply ingrained in our hearts. We firmly follow Chairman Mao's words and are determined to walk the path of collectivization! Chairman Mao says, "The enemy will not disappear by itself." The few capitalist-roaders in the party are not willing to accept their defeat. They strike at us, saying things like "Li Shunda has fallen," "Li Shunda is useless," and so on. But the people of Xigou, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have overcome all difficulties, smashed the plots of the class enemy, and advanced victoriously on the great path indicated by Chairman Mao.

The top capitalist-roader in the party is China's Khrushchev. Like all class enemies, he lifts a stone to drop on his own foot. His dream of restoring capitalism in China will never come true. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, vowing to defend Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought to the death. We will definitely thoroughly settle the accounts of the top capitalist-roader in the party's anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes, definitely pull him down from his horse, make him step aside, and fight him down, fight him to the ground, and fight him to stink!

    批倒党内头号走资本主义道路当权派
    山西省革命委员会委员、全国劳动模范、平顺县西沟大队大队长
　李顺达
    毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，是埋藏在毛主席身边的一颗定时雷，是中国人民的敌人，我们一定要把他打倒。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，公开反对毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说。他主张向帝国主义乞求“和平”；在抗日战争胜利以后，他大力鼓吹“中国革命的主要斗争形式已变为和平的、议会的”；他还宣传什么“三和一少”的修正主义路线，大肆宣扬卖国主义谬论，心甘情愿地要去当美帝国主义的奴才。
    我们广大贫下中农，对帝国主义在中国犯下的滔天罪行，无不咬牙切齿，恨之入骨。一九三九年日本鬼子到我们西沟扫荡，抢走了牛羊牲口、粮食钱财，不计其数。更残酷的是，活活地杀死了我们的阶级兄弟，我的四妹妹才八岁，就被敌人杀死了。伟大祖国的河山被敌人糟踏得不成个样子。这样的深仇大恨，我们怎能忘记！可是自吹为“老革命”的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却偏偏要我们和帝国主义讲“和平”。这简直是白日作梦！用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的。我们在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下组织起来，拿起武器，把日本帝国主义打倒了，把美帝和它的走狗国民党反动派打倒了。我们现在也一定能把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派打倒。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派大吹帝国主义的“帮助”，真是睁着眼睛说瞎话。他表面讲什么“和平”呀！“议会”呀！实际上是向帝国主义投降，出卖祖国，出卖人民。他是地地道道的帝国主义的奴才，是中国人民的大敌。大敌当前，我们一定要把他打倒，使他永世不得翻身！
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，同样反对毛主席和毛泽东思想。我们西沟的广大贫下中农，在一九四三年就积极响应毛主席“组织起来”的伟大号召，第一个组织了互助组。以后又成立了农林牧生产合作社和人民公社，在集体化的道路上，大步前进，使旧社会的穷西沟变成了“山上绿油油，牛羊满山沟，五缺变五有，年年大丰收”的社会主义新山村。这都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。但是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，对这些却恨得要命，怕得要死，公开对抗毛主席的指示，大力提倡“四大自由”“三自一包”，鼓吹发展富农经济。那些钻进党内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，秉承这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的旨意，起劲地反对我们西沟的贫下中农，说我们的坏话，千方百计地打击我们，说我们搞“糟了”，土地“荒”了，妄图把我们的集体经济砍掉，以达到复辟资本主义的目的。
    毛主席的话字字句句说在我们贫下中农的心坎里。毛主席的话，我们坚决听，集体化的道路我们走定了！毛主席说，“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，并不甘心他们的失败。他们打击我们，说什么李顺达“倒”了，“不中用”了，等等。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的西沟人民，战胜了种种困难，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，在毛主席指引的大道上胜利地前进了。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。他和所有的阶级敌人一样，搬起石头打自己的脚。他妄图在中国复辟资本主义的幻梦，永远不会得逞。我们广大贫下中农，坚决站在毛主席的革命路线一边，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫毛泽东思想。我们一定彻底清算党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪行，一定要把他拉下马，让他靠边站，把他斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！
