	Asia-Africa Journalists Association Warmly Congratulates the Establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee

	The victory of the Chinese people is also the victory of the Asian and African peoples. The birth of this new revolutionary government reflects that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the revolutionary forces in China are advancing and consolidating at an accelerated pace, and a historic victory has been achieved in the struggle against bourgeois and revisionist elements.

	BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) — The General Secretary of the Asia-Africa Journalists Association, Chahard, sent a letter on April 22 to the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, extending his warmest congratulations on the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

	The congratulatory message said that the birth of this new revolutionary government in the capital of the People's Republic of China reflects that under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the revolutionary forces in China are advancing and consolidating at an accelerated pace. The red flag of the people's government is flying high in the sky over Beijing, marking that in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the true revolutionary forces guided by Mao Zedong Thought have achieved further historic victories in their struggle against those counter-revolutionary bourgeois and revisionist elements who maliciously attempt to turn people's China back into a paradise for imperialists and exploiters. The victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao in the Cultural Revolution are also victories for the journalists and peoples of Asia and Africa. They are waging a tit-for-tat struggle against their common enemy—imperialism led by the United States and the accomplices led by the Soviet revisionists.

	The message said that at this moment, we recall Chairman Mao Zedong's teaching: The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power. With state power, one has everything; without it, one has nothing. The message said that U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries dream of realizing the counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism in China. They place their hopes on the third and fourth generations of the Chinese Communist Party. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has completely shattered all their illusions. The establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a powerful proof of this.

	The message said that we are glad to see that the broad masses of revolutionary people are full of vigor and high morale, united as one, and are "seizing the revolution and promoting production." The situation on all fronts is excellent. The achievements of the Chinese people are a great support for the anti-imperialist cause of the Asian and African peoples and for the world revolution.

    亚非新闻工作者协会最热烈祝贺北京市革命委员会成立
    中国人民的胜利也是亚非人民的胜利
    这一新的革命政权的诞生，反映了在毛主席领导下中国革命力量正在加速前进和巩固，同资产阶级分子和修正主义分子的斗争取得了划时代的胜利。
    新华社二十三日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多二十二日写信给北京市革命委员会，最热烈地祝贺北京市革命委员会的成立。
    贺信说，在中华人民共和国首都诞生的这一新的革命政权，反映了在毛泽东主席领导下，中国的革命力量正在加速前进和巩固。人民政权的红旗高高飘扬在北京的上空，标志着在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，毛泽东思想指引下的真正的革命力量，在同那些恶毒地企图把人民中国重新变成帝国主义者和剥削者的乐园的反革命资产阶级分子和修正主义分子的斗争中，又取得了进一步的划时代的胜利。毛主席领导下的中国人民在文化大革命中所取得的胜利，也是亚非新闻工作者和亚非人民的胜利。他们正在向着共同的敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏联修正主义领导为首的帮凶，进行着针锋相对的斗争。
    贺信说，此刻，我们想起了毛泽东主席的教导：革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权，就有了一切；失去政权，就失去一切。贺信说，美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派，一心想在中国实现反革命资本主义复辟的美梦，他们把希望寄托在中国共产党的第三代、第四代身上。中国这场文化大革命使他们的种种幻想彻底破产了。北京市革命委员会的成立，就是一个有力的证明。
    贺信说，我们高兴地看到，广大的革命人民，意气风发，斗志昂扬，团结一致，“抓革命，促生产”，各个战线上都呈现一派大好形势。中国人民所取得的成就是对亚非人民反帝事业和对世界革命的极大支持。
