The capital's revolutionary masses from various sectors held a solemn gathering today to denounce the heinous crimes of the Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique in Indonesia, which is anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people, and is brutally persecuting overseas Chinese. We pay tribute to the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and conducting a heroic and unyielding struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries. We extend our warmest greetings to you!

We firmly support our government's statement of April 26. This statement is a powerful response by the 700 million Chinese people to the insane provocations of the Indonesian reactionaries and a resolute support for the patriotic overseas Chinese and revolutionary people of Indonesia.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "In the history of mankind, any reactionary force that is about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces." The Indonesian reactionaries, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Indonesian people, are making their final struggle. They are the enemies of the Indonesian people, the butchers who brutally persecute overseas Chinese, and the culprits who wantonly destroy Sino-Indonesian diplomatic relations!

The Indonesian reactionaries have trampled on the most basic principles of international relations. They have sent armed military police to surround our embassy, forcibly seized and detained our consul-general in Jakarta, and declared our chargé d'affaires and consul-general as "unwelcome persons." For such outrageous provocations against the Chinese people, all patriotic people must give the most resolute response!

The Indonesian reactionaries have been rampaging across the country, attacking overseas Chinese, looting their property, and arbitrarily killing them. They have been enforcing the infamous Presidential Decree No. 10, which is aimed at expelling overseas Chinese. In North Sumatra and West Kalimantan, they have herded tens of thousands of overseas Chinese into concentration camps, and in various places, they have imprisoned large numbers of innocent overseas Chinese, subjecting them to severe torture and brutal mistreatment. We must settle accounts with the Indonesian reactionaries for these fascist racial crimes, and blood debts must be repaid with blood!

Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, patriotic overseas Chinese in Jakarta have risen up to fight, as have those in East Java, North Sumatra, and other places. Your heroic struggle against persecution has demonstrated the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought, the fearless revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people, and their indomitable heroic spirit. Your struggle has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and thoroughly exposed the arrogance of the Indonesian reactionaries. Your struggle against persecution is truly magnificent!

Your struggle is not isolated. The revolutionary people of Indonesia sympathize with and support you. The powerful socialist motherland is your strong backing, and the 700 million people of the motherland are your steadfast support. The progressive public opinion of the world gives you strong support.

Your struggle against persecution has made the Indonesian reactionaries tremble with fear and hate with rage. They hastily sent armed military police to brutally suppress the unarmed patriotic overseas Chinese. Their brutality does not prove their strength; instead, it further exposes their paper tiger nature.

The great motherland is undergoing an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution that is shaking the world. We are uprooting the source of revisionism within the country, overthrowing, smashing, and exposing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road! Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we have already achieved great victories and will continue to achieve more. In the great capital of the motherland, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been established. The people of the motherland are making immortal contributions to consolidating and developing the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and building the motherland into an unshakable proletarian fortress that will never change color.

Our motherland has never been as strong and consolidated, as vibrant and flourishing as it is today! The great victory of the cultural revolution in the motherland has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, and has greatly encouraged the oppressed peoples and nations of the world who are in struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! The people of the world must have courage, dare to fight, not be afraid of difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. Then, the whole world will surely belong to the people. All devils will be thoroughly wiped out." We are deeply convinced that you will be able to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen your unity with the Indonesian people, dare to struggle, and be good at struggling, to thoroughly smash any attack by the Indonesian reactionaries.

The invincible and boundless Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path of the world's revolutionary struggle. Advancing along this path with courage will surely enable us to overcome any difficulty and achieve brilliant victories!

Strongly protest the anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries!

Salute to the heroic struggling patriotic overseas Chinese!

The 700 million Chinese people pledge to be the backbone of the patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia!

Firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people!

Down with American imperialism!

Down with Soviet modern revisionism!

Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!

Long live the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

    首都各界革命群众声讨印度尼西亚反动派反华排华罪行大会
    致印度尼西亚爱国华侨的慰问电
    新华社二十七日讯　首都各界革命群众声讨印度尼西亚反动派反华排华罪行大会致印度尼西亚爱国华侨的慰问电亲爱的侨胞们：
    我们伟大祖国首都的各界革命群众今天庄严集会，愤怒声讨苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团反共反华反人民、疯狂迫害华侨的滔天罪行！我们向高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同印尼反动派进行英勇不屈的反迫害斗争的广大爱国侨胞致敬，并向你们致以最亲切的慰问！
    我们坚决拥护我国政府四月二十六日的声明。这个声明是七亿中国人民对印尼反动派疯狂挑衅的有力反击，是对印尼广大爱国华侨和印尼革命人民的坚决支持。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。双手沾满印尼人民鲜血的印尼反动派正在进行最后挣扎，他们是印尼人民的敌人，也是疯狂迫害华侨的刽子手，恣意破坏中国—印尼外交关系的罪魁祸首！
    印尼反动派践踏最起码的国际关系准则，出动大批武装军警包围我国大使馆，武装劫持并扣留我国驻雅加达总领事，宣布我代办和总领事为“不受欢迎的人”。对于印尼反动派这种对中国人民最猖狂的挑衅，一切热爱祖国的人都要予以最坚决的回击！
    印尼反动派在各地疯狂袭击华侨、抢劫华侨财产，任意杀害华侨。它在各地强迫执行臭名昭著的排华的总统十号法令，大规模逼迁华侨。它在北苏门答腊和西加里曼丹，把成千上万华侨关进集中营，在各地把大批无辜华侨关进监狱，进行严刑拷打和残酷折磨，对于印尼反动派这种法西斯种族主义的血腥罪行，我们一定要清算，血债一定要用血来还！
    在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，雅加达爱国侨胞起来斗争了，东爪哇爱国侨胞起来斗争了，北苏门答腊和各地的爱国侨胞起来斗争了。你们的英勇的反迫害斗争，表现了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的强大威力，表现了中国人民大无畏的革命精神和坚不可摧的英雄气概，你们的斗争大长革命人民的志气，大灭印尼反动派的威风。你们的反迫害斗争真是好得很！
    你们的斗争决不是孤立的。印尼革命人民同情和支持你们，强大的社会主义祖国是你们强有力的靠山，祖国七亿人民是你们坚强的后盾。全世界的进步舆论给你们有力的声援。
    你们的反迫害斗争使印尼反动派怕得要死，恨得要命。他们慌忙出动武装军警，向手无寸铁的爱国侨胞进行残酷镇压。他们的残暴一点也不能说明他们的强大，相反地却是更加暴露了他们虚弱的纸老虎的本质。
    伟大的祖国正在进行震撼世界的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，我们正在挖掉国内产生修正主义的总后台，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，我们已经取得了伟大的胜利，还要继续取得胜利。在伟大祖国的首都，北京市革命委员会诞生了。祖国人民为巩固和发展无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，把祖国建成为无产阶级铁打江山，永不变色，正在建立不朽的功勋。
    我们的祖国从来没有象今天这样强大和巩固，这样朝气蓬勃和欣欣向荣！祖国文化大革命的伟大胜利，沉重地打击了帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派，同时也极大地鼓舞了正在斗争中的全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族。
    毛主席教导我们：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”我们深信，你们一定能够更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，更紧密地加强同印尼人民的团结，敢于斗争，善于斗争，彻底粉碎印尼反动派的任何进攻。
    战无不胜的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想照亮了世界人民革命斗争的道路，沿着这条道路奋勇前进，就一定能够克服任何困难，取得辉煌的胜利！
    强烈抗议印尼反动派的反华排华罪行！
    向英勇斗争的爱国华侨致敬！
    七亿中国人民誓作印尼爱国华侨的后盾！
    坚决支持印尼人民的革命斗争！
    打倒美帝国主义！
    打倒苏联现代修正主义！
    打倒印尼反动派！
    中国、印尼人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    北京市各界革命群众声讨印度尼西亚反动派反华排华罪行大会
              一九六七年四月二十七日
