In the face of the great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in our country, on the eve of the international labor day, our heroic People's Liberation Army has brought us more good news. On April 29, our air force units shot down a U.S. imperialist unmanned reconnaissance aircraft over a certain place in Guangxi.

Our heroic air force units had already achieved a glorious victory by shooting down two U.S. F-4B fighter jets on April 24. Just six days later, they added another victory to the nation. This is a brilliant victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a brilliant victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Heroic air force soldiers, you have fought beautifully. You have defended the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat with your actual actions and greatly encouraged the revolutionary people of the entire nation. We salute you with the highest respect.

The U.S. imperialist, this habitual aggressor, will never lay down its butcher's knife. Just six days after its war provocation failed, it still does not give up and sends aircraft to intrude into our airspace to provoke. We must give a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialist's provocation.

Currently, the U.S. imperialist, in order to save its defeat in the Vietnam War, is hastening to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam and continuously escalate the war. It is also trying to establish an anti-China encirclement around our country. However, whether in South Vietnam, North Vietnam, or China, the U.S. imperialist will not find a single straw to save itself, and the result will be failure upon failure.

The People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is a powerful pillar of the proletarian dictatorship in our country. At present, they are vigorously supporting the revolutionary leftists, aiding industrial and agricultural production, and making new contributions to defend the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat; at the same time, they are alert to the war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries, ready to annihilate any invading enemy at any time, and resolutely support the liberation struggles of the people of all countries, powerfully safeguarding world peace. The People's Liberation Army, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is forever a model for the people of our country to learn from.

We warn the U.S. imperialists: the Chinese people are not to be trifled with. We will resolutely retaliate against your war provocations and will not be lenient. Whether you send manned aircraft or unmanned aircraft; whether from the air or from the sea; whenever and however many you send, we will definitely annihilate them completely and thoroughly.

    再来再打

    在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的大好形势下，在世界劳动人民的节日——“五一”节的前夕，我英勇的人民解放军又传捷报。四月二十九日，我空军部队在广西某地上空，击落美帝国主义军用无人驾驶侦察机一架。
    我英勇的空军部队曾经在四月二十四日取得一举全歼美国Ｆ—4Ｂ型战斗机两架的辉煌胜利。时隔六日，他们又为祖国人民增添了胜利的战绩。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利，这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的光辉胜利。
    英勇的空军战士们，你们打得太漂亮了。你们以实际行动保卫了无产阶级文化大革命，极大地鼓舞了全国革命人民。我们向你们致以崇高的敬礼。
    美帝国主义这个侵略成性的强盗，是决不会放下屠刀的。六天前，它的战争挑衅刚刚失败，但是它还不甘心，还要派飞机侵入我国领空进行挑衅。对于美帝国主义的这种挑衅，必须狠狠地打，重重地揍。
    目前，美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南的战争失败，正在加紧扩大侵越战争，不断进行战争“升级”。并且竭力在我国周围建立反华包围圈。但是，无论在南越战场，在越南北方，还是在中国，美帝国主义都捞不到一根可以救命的稻草，落得的下场，是失败加上更大的失败。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军，是我国无产阶级专政的强有力的支柱。当前，他们竭力支持革命左派，支援工农业生产，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命立新功，建新劳；同时也警惕美帝国主义和一切反动派的战争阴谋，随时消灭敢于来犯的敌人，最坚决地支持各国人民的解放斗争，有力地捍卫着世界的和平。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的人民解放军，永远是我国人民学习的榜样。
    我们要警告美帝国主义：中国人民不是好惹的。对于你们的战争挑衅，我们坚决回击，决不手软。不管你们派有人驾驶的飞机来，还是派无人驾驶的飞机来；不管从空中来，从海上来；不管什么时候来，来多少，我们一定把它坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭掉。
