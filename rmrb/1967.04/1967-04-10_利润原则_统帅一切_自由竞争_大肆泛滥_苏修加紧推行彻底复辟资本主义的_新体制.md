The Soviet revisionist leadership is vigorously pushing forward a comprehensive capitalist restoration "new system" in Soviet industry and other state-owned enterprises, with the capitalist principle of profit as its core.

According to Soviet publications, the Soviet revisionists' further restoration of the capitalist economic management "new system" began to be formally implemented nationwide on a large scale last January. This year is the "most important stage," and it will be completed by 1968. By the end of last year, 673 important industrial enterprises in steel, metallurgy, petroleum, chemicals, and machinery manufacturing, as well as many enterprises in the railway, automobile transport, maritime, river, air, postal, telecommunications, and trade departments, had implemented the "new system." The report boasts that "now, the scope of the reform is expanding immeasurably: the reform is not just being implemented in hundreds of enterprises, but in thousands of enterprises and entire industrial sectors."

This plan to comprehensively restore capitalism in industrial enterprises was proposed as early as during Khrushchev's rule. To prepare public opinion, under the encouragement of the Soviet revisionist leaders, Soviet economics professor Liberman proposed a reform based on "profit" in *Pravda* in September 1962. As soon as this proposal was made, Soviet publications published a large number of articles, enthusiastically praising it. Subsequently, the Soviet leaders, disregarding the opposition of the broad masses, began to implement this new measure to further restore capitalism in some light industrial enterprises under the pretext of "experimentation."

Transforming Socialist Enterprises into Capitalist Enterprises

After the new Soviet leadership came to power, they hastily accelerated the pace of comprehensively restoring capitalism in all sectors of the national economy. They are vigorously pushing forward a comprehensive capitalist restoration "new system" in industry and other state-owned enterprises.

At the end of 1964, the new Soviet leadership decided to expand Khrushchev's "direct ordering system" for production and sales units, which was piloted in two sewing companies, to 400 light industrial enterprises. In early 1965, the practice of using profit as the main indicator began to be implemented in the heavy industry sector, and then it was expanded to the automobile transport, commercial, catering, and food industries. In September and October of the same year, the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Supreme Soviet held plenary sessions and issued the so-called "Statute on Socialist State-Owned Production Enterprises," systematizing the set of measures that had been advocated and piloted to retreat towards capitalism, and formulating a comprehensive capitalist restoration "new system" to be universally implemented nationwide in the form of party resolutions and government decrees.

Preparing to Expand to All Domains of Domestic Life

This "new system" blatantly places the capitalist principle of profit as the "locomotive" driving all economic activities. Kosygin proposed that profit should be used as the "best way" to guide enterprises to improve production efficiency, an important standard to evaluate the "contribution" of enterprises, and the "source" of material incentives. According to this guiding principle of profit-oriented leadership, the Soviet revisionist leadership decided to cancel a series of important indicators originally issued by the state, so that enterprises implementing the "new system" can pursue high profits without restraint. To open up more avenues for enterprises to make money, the Soviet revisionist leaders vigorously advocated developing direct links between supply and demand enterprises according to the free competition laws of the capitalist market economy. The "new system" grants enterprise leaders greater and more privileges, and under the premise of completing the remittance of profits, they almost have the right to handle all matters of the enterprise. While the broad masses of workers are deprived of all rights, becoming wage slaves selling their labor.

The Soviet revisionist leadership's industrial management "new system" with profit as the core, in its implementation, has far exceeded the scope of the industrial sector and has actually expanded to all state-owned enterprises. The so-called "Statute on Socialist State-Owned Production Enterprises" clearly stipulates that this statute, which aims to achieve the "new system," is not only applicable to state-owned industrial enterprises but also to construction, agriculture, transportation, and postal enterprises. Kosygin further emphasized at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting on August 3 last year that "economic reform" should be "continuously expanded to all sectors of the national economy."

Under the instigation of the Soviet leaders, a new wave of implementing the capitalist "principle of profit" in all domains of domestic life has swept through the Soviet Union. The All-Union Academic Conference passed a proposal suggesting that "scientific research institutions and design institutions be given profit plans" and that profit "become the source of reward funds and development funds." Some leaders of higher education institutions published an article in *Pravda* advocating the use of "economic principles" such as "material interests" in large-scale higher education institutions. A manager of an opera and ballet theater suggested in a newspaper that, in accordance with the spirit of "the state reforming the entire leadership system of the national economy," the theater should adopt "new leadership principles and methods." Soviet publications have also continuously published articles, repeatedly advocating the implementation of the profit principles of the "new system" in film studios, stimulating film studios to produce films with "box office value," and so on. According to the Soviet *Lenin's Banner*, even in the Moscow region, "new system" lifeguard stations have appeared. The lifeguards fear that saving people from drowning will interfere with their "sideline income" and affect "economic accounting," and watch drowning people struggle in the water without rescuing them.

Facing Resistance and Opposition from the Soviet People

The "new system" to restore capitalism that the Soviet revisionist leadership is pushing forward has faced resistance and opposition from the Soviet people from the very beginning.

Even in the Soviet revisionist leadership's tightly controlled publications, sometimes there are leaks of the Soviet people's dissatisfaction and protests. A Soviet reader wrote to the Soviet *Literary Gazette* saying, "Rubles, rubles, money, business... you see and hear from the newspapers and radio only these words. For fifty years, we have been taught to be selfless towards a person and a worker... not to touch coins and soil oneself, and in this situation, people suddenly have an impulse: 'I respect you if you give me profit.'" "Profit, material incentives are beginning to squeeze out the high moral and ethical standards here."

Some people, when Liberman's "proposal" was first made, immediately exposed the essence of this thoroughly capitalist restoration reactionary line. They pointed out that implementing this set of measures would lead to serious disruption of the national economic proportions, meaning abandoning the planned national economy and the socialist achievements of the October Revolution. Since the Soviet revisionist leadership has comprehensively pushed forward the "new system," it has further provoked the resistance and opposition of the Soviet people, making the Soviet revisionist ruling clique increasingly anxious. In the early stages of implementing the "new system," the Soviet revisionist leaders loudly called for the removal of "obstacles"; recently, they have openly taken repressive measures, using "administrative measures" to suppress.

Chairman Mao said, "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly be victorious." The great Soviet people, with the glorious tradition of the Great October Revolution, will certainly rise up to wage a resolute struggle against the Soviet revisionist leadership. The historical process opened up by the great Lenin in person in the Soviet Union, although it has encountered twists and turns for a time, will certainly break through all obstacles and move forward. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique that attempts to block this process will inevitably be crushed by the wheel of history.

    “利润原则”统帅一切　“自由竞争”大肆泛滥
    苏修加紧推行彻底复辟资本主义的“新体制”
    新华社九日讯　本社记者报道：苏联修正主义领导集团，正在苏联工业及其它国营企业中，加紧推行以资本主义利润原则为核心的、彻底复辟资本主义的“新体制”。
    据苏联报刊报道，苏修进一步复辟资本主义的经济管理“新体制”，从去年一月开始正式在苏联全国大规模推行，今年是“最重要的阶段”，将于一九六八年完成。到去年底为止，已经有六百七十三个钢铁、冶金、石油、化学和机器制造等重要工业企业，一系列铁路、汽车运输、海运、河运、空运、邮电和贸易部门的许多企业实行“新体制”。报道宣扬说，“现在，实行改革的范围正在不可估量地扩大着：实行这种改革的不只是数百个企业，而是数千个企业和整个整个的工业部门。”
    这个在工业企业中全面复辟资本主义的计划，是早在赫鲁晓夫统治时期就提出的。为了进行舆论准备，在苏修领导人的鼓励下，苏联经济学教授利别尔曼一九六二年九月在《真理报》上，抛出了一个“以利润为基础”的改革建议。这个建议一出笼，苏联报刊就连续发表大量文章，竭力为它吹嘘。接着苏联领导人便不顾广大群众的反对，在“试验”的幌子下，开始在一些轻工业企业里推行这种进一步复辟资本主义的新措施。
    变社会主义企业为资本主义企业
    苏联新领导上台后，迫不及待地大大加速在国民经济各部门中全面复辟资本主义的步伐。在工业及其它国营企业中密锣紧鼓地推行彻底复辟资本主义的“新体制”。
    苏联新领导一九六四年底，就决定把赫鲁晓夫在两家缝纫公司中试行的产销单位“直接订货制度”，推广到四百家轻工业企业。一九六五年初，在重工业部门开始推行以利润为主要指标的作法，随后又向汽车运输业、商业、饮食业和食品工业等部门推广。同年九、十月召开了苏共中央全会和最高苏维埃会议，颁布了所谓《社会主义国营生产企业条例》，把过去鼓吹和试行的一套向资本主义倒退的措施系统化，制定出一个全面复辟资本主义的“新体制”，以党的决议和政府法令的形式在全国范围内普遍推行。
    准备推广到国内生活的一切领域
    这个“新体制”，赤裸裸地把资本主义的利润原则当作带动一切经济活动的“火车头”。柯西金提出，要把利润当作“引导企业提高生产效率的最好办法”、评价企业“贡献”的重要标准和进行物质刺激的“源泉”。根据这种利润挂帅的指导原则，苏修领导集团决定取消原由国家下达的一系列重要指标，以便那些实行“新体制”的企业不受拘束地追逐高额利润。为了给企业开辟更多的赚钱门路，苏联修正主义领导人，大肆鼓吹按照资本主义市场经济的自由竞争法则，“广泛地发展供求企业之间的直接联系”。“新体制”赋予企业领导人更大和更多的特权，在完成上缴利润的前提下，他们几乎有权自行处理企业的一切事务。而广大职工被剥夺了一切权利，沦为出卖劳动的雇佣奴隶。
    苏修领导集团的这套以利润挂帅为核心的工业管理“新体制”，在推行中远远超出了工业部门的范围，实际已扩大到一切国营企业。所谓的《社会主义国营生产企业条例》明确规定，这个以实现“新体制”为目的的条例，不仅适用于国营工业企业，而且也适用于建筑业、农业、运输和邮电企业。柯西金在去年八月三日苏联最高苏维埃会议上进一步强调，应把“经济改革”“不断地普及到国民经济的一切部门”。
    在苏联领导人的策动下，苏联掀起了一个把资本主义“利润原则”贯彻到国内生活一切领域中去的新浪潮。全苏学术会议曾通过一项建议，建议给“科学研究机关和设计机关规定取得利润的计划”，并且使利润“成为构成奖励基金和发展基金的来源”。有的高等学校领导人在《真理报》上发表文章，主张在大型的高等院校里也运用象“物质利益”这样一些“经济原则”。一个歌剧和芭蕾舞剧院经理在报上建议，按照“国家改革国民经济整个领导体制”的精神，在剧院采取“新的领导原则和方法”。苏联报刊还接连发表文章，一再宣扬把“新体制”的利润原则贯彻到电影制片厂，刺激制片厂拍摄具有“票房价值”的影片等等。据苏联《列宁旗帜报》报道，在莫斯科州甚至还出现了“新体制”的救生站。救生员怕下水救人妨碍“副业”收入，影响“经济核算”，眼看着落水的人在水里挣扎，见死不救。
    受到苏联人民的抵制和反对
    苏修领导集团所推行的这一套复辟资本主义的“新体制”，从一开始就受到苏联人民的抵制和反对。
    就是在苏联修正主义领导集团严密控制的报刊上，有时也会透露出一些苏联人民的不满和抗议。一位苏联读者写信给苏联《文学报》说，“卢布、卢布、金钱、生意……你从报上看到和从无线电里听到的只是这些字眼。五十年来我们教导对一个人和工作人员要大公无私……不要碰上硬币而沾污了自己，而在这种情况下，人们忽然心血来潮：‘我尊敬你，如果你给我利润的话’”，“利润、物质刺激开始在我们这里排挤掉了道德和德行的高度要求”。
    有一些人，在利别尔曼“建议”一出笼时，就对这条彻底复辟资本主义的反动路线的实质进行了揭露。他们指出，推行这一套办法，将导致国民经济比例的严重破坏，意味着放弃国民经济计划化和十月革命的社会主义成果。苏修领导集团全面推行“新体制”以来，更加激起苏联人民的抵制和反对，这使苏修统治集团越来越惶恐不安。在推行“新体制”的初期，苏修领导人就大肆叫嚷要扫除“障碍”；近来，他们更公然采取高压手段，使用“行政措施”进行镇压。
    毛主席说，“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”有着伟大十月革命光荣传统的苏联人民，必将奋起与苏修领导集团作坚决的斗争。苏联社会在伟大列宁亲自领导下开创的历史进程，虽然一时遇到曲折和逆流，但是，总会冲破重重障碍向前发展的，妄图阻挡这一进程的苏联修正主义叛徒集团，必将被历史的车轮碾得粉碎。
