The American imperialist's lackey, Mobutu, in the Congo (Leopoldville), since taking power in November 1965, has pretended to change some of the practices of the past puppet regimes. He has raised the banner of "nationalism," loudly proclaiming opposition to Belgian colonialism and striving for "economic independence"; he has hypocritically opposed the white regime in Southern Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonialists, and "supported" the African national liberation movements; he has boasted of "guaranteeing" friendship with neighboring countries and "reconciliation" with African states, and so on. He has even dressed himself up as a "nationalist" and a successor to Lumumba's cause, attempting to infiltrate the ranks of the independent African nations to sabotage the cause of African unity against imperialism. This is a highly deceptive political trick being played by American neocolonialism in Africa.

This trick of American neocolonialism must be exposed!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To judge a person's character, look at his past actions; to judge his future actions, look at his past and present actions."

Who is Mobutu? The people of the Congo (Leopoldville) know his true colors, and so do the African people.

Mobutu was long ago bought by the Belgian colonialists and became their lackey. In 1959, the year before the Congo (Leopoldville) gained independence, he infiltrated the Congolese National Movement Party led by Lumumba and deceived Lumumba into trusting him. Therefore, after the Congo (Leopoldville) gained independence, he served as the Chief of Staff of the Army and other positions in Lumumba's government. After the American imperialists invaded the Congo (Leopoldville), he quickly betrayed them and became an American imperialist lackey. In September 1960, under the orders of the American imperialists, he launched a military coup, illegally "closed" the parliament, and "seized" the power of the national government, detaining Prime Minister Lumumba. Subsequently, he kidnapped Lumumba and, in collusion with the Belgian colonialist lackey Tshombe, murdered Lumumba, causing the Congolese national liberation movement to suffer a serious setback.

This traitor to the Congo (Leopoldville) nation and murderer of Lumumba now wants to seize the banner of the Congolese national hero Lumumba. Is this not absurd?

Mobutu is a butcher of the Congolese people. Even during the Belgian rule, he served as a thug in the colonial authorities' "security forces." After independence, he has always collaborated with successive puppet regimes to massacre the Congolese people. In 1961, he collaborated with Tshombe to launch a large-scale attack on the then-legal government-controlled Eastern Province. During the period when the American imperialists used the "United Nations forces" to invade the Congo (Leopoldville), he colluded with the "United Nations forces" to massacre the Congolese people. In 1964, after the Congolese people launched an armed struggle, Mobutu mobilized all the puppet troops and recruited foreign mercenaries to brutally suppress the patriotic armed forces. In November 1964, he collaborated with American and Belgian paratroopers to massacre Stanleyville. After seizing power in the coup, he raved about using military means to completely eliminate the Congolese patriotic armed forces.

This American imperialist lackey and public enemy of the Congolese people now wants to transform himself into a successor to Lumumba's cause. Is this not a strange phenomenon?

After Mobutu took power, he loudly proclaimed that he would wage a "life-and-death struggle" against the Belgian financial conglomerates. This is also a deception.

The Mobutu puppet regime announced the revocation of the monopoly and lease rights of Belgian colonialists to exploit Congolese natural resources. However, it then announced the implementation of an "open door" policy, accepting all foreign investments and forming an international consortium including American and French capital, attempting to replace the former Belgian-controlled Union Minière du Haut Katanga through the newly established Congolese Mining Corporation. While this new mining company is nominally controlled by the Congolese puppet regime, it is actually completely in the hands of American monopoly capital. Anyone with eyes can see that the so-called "open door" is open to American imperialism; the so-called "international consortium" is a consortium manipulated by American imperialism.

What is this opposition to Belgian colonialism and striving for "economic independence"? It is merely a transfer of the rich resources of the Congo (Leopoldville) from the hands of old Belgian colonialists to the more greedy American imperialists.

Mobutu's so-called opposition to the white regime in Southern Rhodesia, opposition to Portuguese colonialists, and "support" for African national liberation movements are even more deceitful. Mobutu even openly uses cunning tactics, using the pretext of joint anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism to coerce African countries into abandoning their support for the Congolese patriotic armed forces. At the end of 1965, when the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity was considering taking military action against the white regime in Southern Rhodesia, the representative of the Congolese puppet regime at the press conference openly stated that the Congolese authorities could agree with the Organization of African Unity's attitude towards the Southern Rhodesia issue, but as a quid pro quo, African countries must "guarantee" not to provide assistance to the Congolese "rebels" (referring to the patriotic armed forces). What kind of support for the African national liberation movement is Mobutu's so-called "support"? Is it not clear as day?

Mobutu's deceptive tactics are entirely directed by American imperialism. American imperialism has changed its tactics, instructing Mobutu to raise the banner of "anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism" to lull the African people, temporarily ease the tension between the puppet regime and the United States and African countries, and improve their difficult and isolated situation in Africa. American imperialism intends to use this pretext to further replace the Belgian colonialists in the Congo (Leopoldville), strengthen its control over the Congo (Leopoldville), and then, in a more favorable situation, carry out subversion and aggression against Africa.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has always colluded with American imperialism to sabotage the Congolese national liberation movement. Now, they are also colluding with the Mobutu puppet regime, pulling strings together. The Congolese people have already seen through the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership's betrayal of the Congolese revolution from the lessons of blood.

All imperialists and reactionaries in the world always use the two reactionary tactics of armed suppression and political deception against revolutionary people. Sometimes they use both tactics simultaneously, sometimes they use them alternately. But whether they use armed suppression or political deception, their goal is to achieve their rule and enslavement of the people. The facts in the Congo (Leopoldville) fully prove this. Their reactionary nature will not change. "They will never lay down their butcher's knives; they will never become Buddhas until their destruction."

Through their struggle, the Congolese people and the African people have increasingly seen through the aggressive nature of American imperialism. They deeply understand that revolutionary people must not harbor unrealistic illusions about American imperialism and its lackeys. As long as the Congolese people persist in a long-term armed struggle, they will surely be able to drive out the imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, overthrow the puppet regime, and achieve thorough national liberation.

### 不许美国走狗蒙博托招摇撞骗

    不许美国走狗蒙博托招摇撞骗
    美帝国主义在刚果（利）的走狗蒙博托，自一九六五年十一月上台以后，装模作样地改变了过去历届傀儡政权的一些做法。他打起“民族主义”的旗号，高唱反对比利时老牌殖民主义，争取“经济独立”；假惺惺地反对南罗得西亚白人政权和葡萄牙殖民主义者，“支持”非洲民族解放运动；扬言“保证”对邻国“友好”，同非洲国家“和解”，等等。他俨然把自己打扮成一个“民族主义者”和卢蒙巴事业的“继承者”，企图钻进非洲民族独立国家的队伍，来破坏非洲团结反帝事业。这是美国新殖民主义正在非洲推行的一个极其狡诈的政治骗局。
    美国新殖民主义的这个骗局，必须加以揭穿！
    毛主席教导我们：对于反动派，“看它的过去，就可以知道它的现在；看它的过去和现在，就可以知道它的将来。”
    蒙博托是什么人？刚果（利）人民是知道他的底细的，非洲人民是知道他的底细的。
    蒙博托早就被比利时殖民者收买，成为它的走狗。一九五九年，也就是刚果（利）取得独立的前一年，在民族独立运动高涨的形势下，他曾混入卢蒙巴领导的刚果民族运动党，并骗取了卢蒙巴的信任。因此在刚果（利）独立后，他担任了卢蒙巴政府的陆军参谋长等职。在美帝国主义侵入刚果（利）后，他又很快地投靠了美帝国主义，成为美帝国主义的走狗。一九六○年九月，他在美帝国主义指使下，发动军事政变，非法“封闭”议会，“接管”民族政府权力，软禁卢蒙巴总理。随后他又悍然绑架了卢蒙巴，并伙同比利时殖民者的走狗冲伯杀害了卢蒙巴，使刚果（利）民族解放运动遭受了严重的挫折。
    蒙博托这个刚果（利）民族的败类，杀害卢蒙巴的凶手，现在竟摇身一变，企图大抓刚果（利）民族英雄卢蒙巴的旗帜，这不是荒唐透顶的吗？
    蒙博托是屠杀刚果（利）人民的刽子手。早在比利时统治时期，他就在殖民当局的“治安部队”中充当殖民主义者的打手。独立后，他一直伙同历届傀儡政权屠杀刚果（利）人民。一九六一年，他配合冲伯分头向当时合法政府所控制的东方省发动了大规模的进攻。在美帝国主义利用“联合国军”侵略刚果（利）时期，他勾结“联合国军”大肆屠杀刚果（利）人民。一九六四年，刚果（利）人民发动武装斗争以后，蒙博托调动全部傀儡军队，并搜罗外国雇佣军，残酷镇压爱国武装力量。一九六四年十一月，他配合美、比伞兵血洗斯坦利维尔。他在政变上台以后，疯狂叫嚷要“用军事手段”把刚果（利）爱国武装力量完全消灭掉。
    蒙博托这个美帝国主义走狗，刚果（利）人民的公敌，现在竟摇身一变，成为卢蒙巴事业的“继承者”了，这不是天下奇闻吗？
    蒙博托上台以后，煞有介事地叫喊，要对比利时大金融集团进行“殊死的战斗”。这也是骗人的。
    蒙博托傀儡政权曾经宣布收回比利时殖民主义者开采刚果（利）自然资源的垄断权和租让权。但是，接着它就宣布实行“门户开放”政策，接受一切外国投资，组成一个包括美法资本在内的国际财团，企图通过新成立的刚果矿业总公司，来取代原来受比利时控制的上加丹加联合矿业公司。而这个新的矿业公司，名义上由刚果（利）傀儡政权控制，实际上完全掌握在美国垄断资本的手中。明眼人一看就知道，所谓“门户开放”，就是向美帝国主义开放；所谓“国际财团”，就是美帝国主义操纵的财团。
    什么反对比利时殖民主义，什么争取“经济独立”，其实不过是把刚果（利）的丰富资源从比利时老殖民主义的手里转让给更加贪婪的美帝国主义而已。
    蒙博托的所谓反对南罗得西亚白人政权，反对葡萄牙殖民主义者，“支持”非洲民族解放运动，则更是欺人之谈。蒙博托甚至公然采取狡诈手段，以共同反帝反殖为幌子，诱逼非洲国家放弃对刚果（利）人民爱国武装的支持。一九六五年底，非洲统一组织部长会议酝酿对南罗得西亚白人政权采取武力制裁，刚果（利）傀儡政权出席会议的代表就在记者招待会上公开表示，刚果（利）当局可以同意非洲统一组织关于南罗得西亚问题的态度，但是，作为交换条件，非洲国家必须“保证不向刚果（利）叛乱分子（指爱国武装）提供援助”。蒙博托的所谓“支持”非洲民族解放运动，究竟是什么货色，不是昭然若揭的吗？
    蒙博托的这些欺骗做法，完全是美帝国主义所一手导演的。美帝国主义改变手法，指使蒙博托打起“反帝反殖”的旗号，是要以此来麻痹非洲人民，暂时缓和傀儡政权和美国同非洲国家之间的紧张关系，改善它们在非洲的困难和孤立处境。美帝国主义企图在这个幌子下，进一步取代比利时殖民者在刚果（利）的地位，加强对刚果（利）的控制，以便在更有利的情况下，向非洲进行颠覆和侵略。
    苏修领导集团一贯勾结美帝国主义，破坏刚果（利）民族解放运动。现在，他们又在同蒙博托傀儡政权勾勾搭搭，互拉关系。刚果（利）人民已经从血的教训中，看清了苏修领导集团叛卖刚果（利）革命的丑恶嘴脸。
    世界上一切帝国主义和反动派对待革命人民总是采取武力镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手策略。他们有时两者同时并举，有时两者交替使用。但不论是使用武力镇压或是采取政治欺骗，都是为了达到他们统治和奴役人民的目的。刚果（利）的事实充分证明了这一点。他们的反动本性是不会改变的。他们“决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”
    刚果（利）人民和非洲人民通过他们的斗争实践，越来越认清了美帝国主义的侵略本性。他们深切地懂得，革命的人民决不能对美帝国主义及其走狗抱有不切实际的幻想。刚果（利）人民只要坚持长期的武装斗争，就一定能够赶走以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，推翻傀儡政权，取得彻底的民族解放。
