In 1962, when the number one capitalist-roader within the Party once again spread the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation," a film titled "The Blazing Trail," which had been planned for two or three years, was released. As soon as the film came out, an unprecedented large-scale propaganda campaign was launched. Countless articles in newspapers and magazines across the country unanimously praised it as a "model of party leadership." The counter-revolutionary revisionist Summer Yan and his ilk were very satisfied, but they still felt it was not enough, saying: "The propaganda for 'The Blazing Trail' is insufficient."

Why did the "ancestor" of this 1930s film suddenly pay so much attention to a film about workers? The reason is that the "ancestor" has an "ancestor." This black film is a monument built for their ultimate backer. The character Lei Huanjue in the film is the number one capitalist-roader within the Party.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." They actively promoted "The Blazing Trail" to create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

In this black film, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party is portrayed as an incredibly great "leader," a "hero" with unparalleled courage, and a "savior" of the people.

However, history cannot be distorted. In the glorious pages of the history of the Chinese workers' movement, the Anshan Strike was personally led by our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao personally went deep into the mines and workers' quarters of Anshan many times, mobilizing the masses and igniting the flames of revolution. Chairman Mao also proposed the slogan for the strike: "We were once beasts of burden, now we want to be human." The number one capitalist-roader within the Party only arrived there a few days before the strike. The strike was actually carried out under Chairman Mao's specific guidance, and the victory of the Anshan Strike was a victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought!

It was precisely this number one capitalist-roader within the Party who, during the workers' movement in Anshan, opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and peddled his reactionary theory of "exploitation is justified." He promoted "labor-management cooperation" there, became thick as thieves with the capitalists, advocated "civilized struggle," and played a role in sabotaging the great strike. He trembled in the face of the enemy's guns, and the claim of being "brave" is all nonsense.

The Khrushchev of China, in order to build a monument for himself, often boasted about his so-called leadership in the "miners' struggle" and ordered his big and small henchmen to create literary and artistic works about the "miners' struggle." Before the script of "The Blazing Trail" was released, a theater troupe once performed a play about the Anshan Strike in Beijing. The Khrushchev of China watched it and found it unsatisfactory because it did not beautify him, so he criticized the creators of the play, saying: "The historical situation at that time was not like this. Go and check the mining history!"

Master and servant, Summer Yan and his gang, following this black directive, in order to beautify the Khrushchev of China and erase Chairman Mao's great achievements, they used the pretext of "art" to say that artistic works are not about writing history or making documentaries, that they should break away from historical records, develop the plot based on the characters' personalities, and that it is not necessary to include Chairman Mao's deeds in the film. They went to great lengths to find excuses to distort history and sing praises for their ultimate backer.

A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists clung to this distorted historical theme, making a big deal out of it to elevate their master and denigrate Chairman Mao. They formulated a plan for the theme of the "Anshan Strike": one historical struggle, one long novel, and one film. "The Blazing Trail" is one of these three major plans.

These few people spared no effort to make this black film. The capitalist-roader within the Party personally took charge, and during the filming process, they continuously recruited so-called "authorities" to strengthen their forces. The counter-revolutionary revisionists Summer Yan, Chen Huangmei, and others personally came to Shanghai to direct. They repeatedly instructed that the film should highlight their ultimate backer. Summer Yan said: "The character Lei Huanjue is well-written, but lacks luster. It should be said that the early thoughts of Chairman Mao and XXXX (referring to the Khrushchev of China) are both present in him." On the other hand, they deliberately denigrated our red sun, Chairman Mao. In several drafts of the script, there was originally a segment describing how Chairman Mao guided the strike. Summer Yan and his gang of bad elements instructed twice to delete this important content! They even changed Lei Huanjue's report to Chairman Mao into a report to the secretary, not even mentioning Chairman Mao's name. How evil!

This is the black hand of the Khrushchev of China reaching into the film industry! The literary and artistic circles have long failed to implement the Party's policies and guidelines, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The ultimate backer is him! Today, we must pull him down from his horse, make him step aside! We must thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the film industry and carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

    《燎原》是为头号野心家树碑立传的黑影片
    上海东方红电影制片厂　东方红联合战斗队
    一九六二年，正当党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派重新抛出大毒草《修养》的时候，一部策划了两、三年的电影《燎原》出笼了。影片一出来，立刻展开了从来没有过的大规模宣传。全国报刊杂志上的无数评论文章，一致把它称为“表现党的领导的典范”，反革命修正主义分子夏衍等人看了十分满意，可是还嫌不够，说：“《燎原》的宣传太少了。”
    这个三十年代的电影的“祖师爷”，为什么突然对工人题材的影片这么重视了呢？原来“祖”上有“祖”，这部黑影片是为他们的总后台树碑立传的。影片中的雷焕觉，就是这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”他们这一伙积极地吹捧《燎原》，就是为实现资本主义复辟制造舆论。
    在这部黑片里，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，成了高大无比的“领袖”，成了一身是胆的“英雄”，成了人民的“大救星”。
    然而，历史是篡改不了的。在中国工人运动史上占光辉一页的安源大罢工，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的。毛主席多次亲自深入安源的矿井、工棚，发动群众，点燃了革命的烈火。毛主席当时还为矿工提出了罢工斗争的口号：从前是牛马，现在要做人。而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，是罢工前几天才到那儿去的。罢工实际上是在毛主席具体指导下进行的，安源大罢工的胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利！
    而恰恰是这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，在安源搞工运时就对抗毛主席的革命路线，贩卖他那一套“剥削有理”的反动理论。他在那儿大搞“劳资合作”，自己和资本家打得火热，主张“文明斗争”，起了破坏大罢工的作用。他在敌人刀枪面前吓得发抖，什么“一身是胆”，完全是鬼话。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫为了给自己树碑立传，经常吹嘘所谓领导“矿工斗争”的历史，要他的大小爪牙创作“矿工斗争”的文艺作品。《燎原》的电影剧本未出笼之前，有个剧团曾在北京上演过一个描写安源罢工的话剧。中国的赫鲁晓夫看了之后，认为没有为他涂脂抹粉，大为不满，斥责剧团的创作人员说：当时的历史情况并不是这样的，你们去查查矿史看！
    主令仆从，夏衍和他的一伙，按照这个黑指示，为了美化中国的赫鲁晓夫，抹煞毛主席的丰功伟绩，他们打着“艺术”的幌子，说什么艺术作品不是写历史，不是拍纪录片，要跳出史料，根据人物性格发展结构情节，……不一定要把毛主席的事迹搬上影片……。千方百计为篡改历史寻找借口，为他们的总后台歌功颂德。
    一小撮反革命修正主义分子把这个篡改了历史事实的题材抓住不放，大做文章，来抬高他们的主子，贬低毛主席。他们为“安源大罢工”这个题材制定了一个计划，即：一部斗争史，一部长篇小说，一部电影。《燎原》便是这三大计划之一。
    他们这一小撮家伙，为了搞这部黑片是不遗余力的，党内走资本主义道路的当权派亲自“挂帅”，而且在拍摄过程中，不断抽调什么“权威”来充实力量。反革命修正主义分子夏衍、陈荒煤等人亲自来上海指导。他们再三指示影片要突出他们的总后台。夏衍说：“雷焕觉这个人物写得很好，但缺少光彩，应该说毛主席的早期思想，×××（指中国的赫鲁晓夫）身上都有。”另一方面，他们又极力贬低我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。在剧本的几次未定稿上，本来有一段是写毛主席如何指导罢工斗争的情节，夏衍等坏家伙却两次指示，把这个重要内容删掉！甚至连雷焕觉写信向毛主席汇报工作也改为向书记汇报工作，连毛主席三个字也不提。这是何等恶毒！
    这是中国的赫鲁晓夫伸向电影界的黑手！文艺界长期以来不执行党的方针政策，对抗毛主席的革命路线，总后台原来就是他！今天我们必须把他拉下马，让他靠边站！把反革命修正主义文艺路线揭深批透，把电影界的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
