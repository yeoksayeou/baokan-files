The revolutionary faction of Yunnan Province's cultural system has organized a "Cultural and Artistic Support for Spring Plowing Production Propaganda Team." They are going to the mountains and countryside to propagate the thoughts of Mao Zedong and, through practical actions, support spring plowing production.

Participants in this propaganda team include revolutionary factions from various provincial-level art troupes, libraries, Xinhua Bookstores, and film production studios. They have divided into ten small teams and have recently set out for six counties and districts in the suburbs of Kunming, including Anning, Fucheng, Chenggong, and Guandu, to the front lines of spring plowing production.

The propaganda teams are small and lightly equipped. The team members are versatile. Before going to the countryside, each team thoroughly studied Chairman Mao's relevant works and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants in Rural People's Communes and All Levels of Cadres." This is to better propagate the spirit of Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's instructions to the masses through various forms of artistic propaganda. They also expressed their determination to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants through shared eating, living, and labor, to transform their worldviews, and to contribute to spring plowing production and the Cultural Revolution.

    云南文化系统组织宣传队下乡
    云南省文化系统的革命派组织了“文化艺术界支援春耕生产宣传队”，上山下乡宣传毛泽东思想，以实际行动支援春耕生产。
    参加这支宣传队的，有省级各艺术团体和图书馆、新华书店、幻灯制片厂等文化单位的革命派。他们分成十个小分队，已于最近分赴安宁、富民、呈贡、官渡等六个昆明郊区的县、区春耕生产第一线。
    宣传队各分队人少轻装，队员们一专多能。各分队在下乡前，都认真学习了毛主席的有关著作和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，以便更好地把毛主席和党中央的指示精神通过各种文艺宣传形式深入贯彻到群众中去。他们还表示要在同吃、同住、同劳动中更好地向贫下中农学习，改造自己的世界观，为春耕生产和无产阶级文化大革命运动作出贡献。
