After the publication of articles such as "The Bourgeois Reactionary Line on the Cadres Issue Must Be Criticized" in the *Red Flag* magazine, I have further recognized the evil nature of the bourgeois reactionary line and have been filled with even greater hatred. The bourgeois reactionary line aims to change the color of our country, to undermine our revolutionary achievements, and to destroy our socialist state. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we have repelled the attacks of the bourgeois reactionary line. However, the capitalist-roaders in power within the party are not willing to accept their defeat and are constantly plotting to stage a comeback. Now, they are attempting to pin the labels of "excluding everything" and "overthrowing everything" on the revolutionary youngsters, which is their new counteroffensive!

"Excluding everything," "overthrowing everything," and mercilessly striking down cadres who make mistakes are the consistent policies of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party and those who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line during this cultural revolution. From the beginning of the movement, they set frameworks, determined the tone, and sent in large numbers of work teams. On one hand, they suppressed the revolutionary masses, and on the other hand, they implemented the reactionary policy of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" regarding cadres. Under the guidance of this bourgeois reactionary line, a small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within our school also followed suit. After they sent work teams to various departments, they deceived and misled cadres and the masses, forming factions and attacking others to protect themselves. On the contrary, the Red Rebel Corps in our school conscientiously carried out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They conducted class analysis of cadres, distinguished between two types of contradictions, and implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient."

During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I faithfully executed the bourgeois reactionary line and became a tool of a small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, bringing myself to the brink of danger. The revolutionary youngsters saved me, pulling me out of the mud and helping me recognize my mistakes and find the causes of my errors. Over forty people talked to me, arming my mind with Mao Zedong Thought and patiently educating me. They helped me draw a clear line between myself and the small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, and between myself and the bourgeois reactionary line, giving me many opportunities to examine myself and come clean. Every step forward I took, they gave me great encouragement. Those who proposed the bourgeois reactionary line are trying to pin the labels of "overthrowing everything" and "excluding everything" on the revolutionary youngsters, which is absolutely unacceptable. This is the plot of a small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, and I firmly use my personal experience to expose them and counterattack them. In this sharp and complex class struggle, I will bravely stand up and stand together with the revolutionary youngsters to smash the new counteroffensive of the bourgeois reactionary line and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death. I will not allow a small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the party to smear the faces of the revolutionary youngsters.

    回击资产阶级反动路线的反扑
    哈尔滨师范学院原党委组织部副部长　马延昌
    《红旗》杂志《在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判》等文章发表后，使我进一步认识了资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，更激起了我的仇恨。资产阶级反动路线就是要使我国改变颜色，断送我们的革命成果，断送我们的社会主义江山。我们在毛主席的革命路线指引下，打退了资产阶级反动路线的进攻。但是，党内走资本主义道路的当权派并不甘心于他们的失败，总是千方百计地阴谋复辟。现在，他们企图把“排斥一切”、“打倒一切”的罪名强加在革命小将们的身上，这是他们的新反扑！
    “排斥一切”、“打倒一切”，以及对犯错误的干部无情打击，是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的一贯主张，是这次文化大革命中提出资产阶级反动路线的那几个人搞的。他们在运动一开始，就划框框，定调子，大派工作组，一方面镇压革命群众，一方面在干部问题上实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策。在这条资产阶级反动路线的指导下，我院党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，也依法炮制。他们派工作组到各系以后，欺骗、蒙蔽干部和群众，拉一伙，打一伙，来保他们自己。相反的，我院红色造反团认真贯彻执行了毛主席的革命路线。他们对干部进行阶级分析，区分两类不同性质的矛盾，执行了毛主席的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的干部政策。
    我在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中，忠实地执行了资产阶级反动路线，充当了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的工具，走到了危险的边缘。革命小将挽救了我，把我从泥坑里拉出来，帮助我认识错误和寻找犯错误的原因。先后四十多人次和我谈话，用毛泽东思想武装我的头脑，对我进行耐心的教育。他们让我和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界线，和资产阶级反动路线划清界线，给我许多机会，让我检查，亮相。我每前进一步，他们都给我很大的鼓励。提出资产阶级反动路线的人，企图把“打倒一切”、“排斥一切”的罪名强加在革命小将的身上，是万万办不到的。这是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋，我坚决用我的切身体会揭露他们，回击他们。在这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，我要勇敢地站起来，和革命小将共同站在一起，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。坚决不允许党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派往革命小将脸上抹灰。
