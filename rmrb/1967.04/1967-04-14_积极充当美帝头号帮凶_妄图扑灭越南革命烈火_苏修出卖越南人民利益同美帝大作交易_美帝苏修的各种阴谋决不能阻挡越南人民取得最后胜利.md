The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has, since the beginning of this year, further colluded with U.S. imperialism, openly exerting various pressures on the Vietnamese people to force them to surrender to the U.S. aggressors. Facts indicate that, after the failure of the U.S. "bombing halt and deception" for "peace talks" plot, the U.S. has frantically escalated the war and, at the Guam black meeting, plotted new adventurous plans to expand the war in Vietnam, using "war to force surrender." All of these are inseparable from the Soviet revisionists' intensified treacherous activities.

To bring the Vietnamese issue under the track of "Sino-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has, for several years, consistently colluded with the U.S. in a counter-revolutionary strategy of "war and peace," doing everything possible to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war. In recent months, the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique as the number one henchman of the U.S. has been more nakedly exposed in broad daylight.

Since the beginning of this year, while the Johnson administration has been intensifying its aggression against Vietnam, it has, around the so-called "Tet truce," hatched another "bombing halt and deception" plot. Under the direction of Washington, the British Labour Party government, the United Nations Secretary-General, the Vatican, and the Indian reactionaries have successively thrown out various so-called "peace talk" schemes, busily promoting the American new "peace talk" deception. Among these, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has been the most enthusiastic in serving the U.S. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has mobilized all its propaganda machines, echoing Washington, and launched a sustained several-month campaign to promote "bombing halt and peace talks." Soviet newspapers, radio stations, and news agencies have been frantically supporting various American-style "peace talk" schemes, covering up U.S. aggression in Vietnam. They, according to the logic of American bandits, shout that the Vietnam War is "the main factor in international tensions" and "the main source of threats to universal peace"; they advocate stopping the guns in Vietnam, saying that stopping the bombing is "the first step to peacefully resolving the Vietnamese issue." On February 2, Tass openly praised the American bandit leader Johnson's speech at a press conference, saying that "Johnson claimed that if Hanoi showed some willingness to compromise, the U.S. would stop bombing North Vietnam."

The clamor raised by the Soviet revisionist propaganda machine in collaboration with the American "peace talk" plot has been unprecedented in its duration and intensity.

At the same time, to collaborate with the American "peace talk" plot, the Soviet revisionist leaders Podgorny and Kosygin personally went abroad to act as "peace talk" brokers for Washington. In late January, Podgorny visited Italy, peddling American-style "peace talk" goods everywhere. During his week-long visit to Italy, he did not say a word condemning the U.S. aggression against Vietnam but talked about the "serious threat to peace" posed by the Vietnam War. He did not mention the Vietnamese people's just demand that U.S. aggressors must withdraw from South Vietnam but, in collaboration with the American "bombing halt and deception" plot, emphasized that as long as there is a "bombing halt," it can "open the way for a peaceful resolution (of the Vietnamese) conflict." On January 30, he even went to the Vatican to visit Pope Paul VI, exchanging information and secretly negotiating with Washington's loyal servant on the issue of "bombing halt and peace talks."

Soon after, Soviet Premier Kosygin took advantage of the "Tet truce" on the Vietnamese battlefield to rush to London to discuss the Vietnamese issue with British Prime Minister Wilson, pushing the imperialist-revisionist-reactionary "bombing halt and deception" plot to a climax.

During the Sino-British talks, Johnson, Rusk, Goldberg, and others arrogantly demanded that the Vietnamese people surrender to the U.S. stick, immediately respond with "appropriate and gradual de-escalation," and the U.S. "will order" to stop bombing North Vietnam, even demanding that the South Vietnamese people "lay down their arms." Kosygin and Wilson then echoed Washington's big stick and carrot policy from behind the scenes.

Western newspapers and news agencies recently reported that, under the remote control of Johnson from Washington, the three parties of the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union had, during this meeting, intensively discussed the issue of the Vietnamese people taking so-called "reciprocal actions" to exchange for the U.S. stopping the bombing of North Vietnam. During the talks, Johnson had "made great efforts" to explain to Kosygin through Wilson the U.S. proposal that the Vietnamese people should adopt a "reciprocal attitude" before the "bombing halt and peace talks." After the U.S. government's "Tet bombing halt" expired on February 12, it temporarily postponed the resumption of bombing North Vietnam to facilitate Kosygin's "pressure on Hanoi to adopt a reciprocal attitude." According to various sources, Kosygin indeed exerted considerable effort for Washington at this point. According to U.S. newspapers, Kosygin, during the talks, not only provided advice for the American "peace talk" deception but also leaked some information about Vietnam to the Johnson administration through Wilson. The U.S. "bombing halt and deception" plot, supported by the Soviet revisionists, quickly failed. On the day after Kosygin left London, the Johnson administration immediately announced the resumption of bombing North Vietnam, followed by a series of war "escalation" actions. The British "Times" on March 1 quoted a Washington official as saying that the U.S. actions to intensify the aggression against Vietnam and "force surrender" were "related to Kosygin's interest in peace talks (during the London talks)." From these facts, one can see what shameful deeds Kosygin did for the Americans during his visit to Britain.

After the failure of this new "Munich" plot by the imperialist-revisionist-reactionary forces, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has more closely collaborated with the U.S. "war to force surrender" strategy, continuing to conspire with the U.S. and its lackeys behind the scenes to hatch new "peace talk" tricks.

On February 27, the "New York Herald Tribune" published an article by Joseph Alsop from Washington, stating, "It can be said with great certainty that Soviet and American representatives are exploring new initiatives leading to peace in Vietnam in some secret room or other place." The assertion by Alsop, who is close to the White House, is not without basis. According to reports from various sources, since late February, Kosygin and Rusk have separately received the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Thompson, and the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S., Dobrynin, to secretly discuss the Vietnamese issue. Recently, the Soviet representative has also had frequent contacts and talks with the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant in the U.S. The so-called "three-point proposal" published by U Thant on March 28 is a new product of the U.S.-Soviet collusion, continuing to implement the policy of "pressuring surrender" and "forcing surrender" against the Vietnamese people.

The "Washington Star" and the "New York Times" recently commented that, "In the past few weeks, it has been clear that the Russians are actively seeking to resolve the Vietnam War in a way acceptable to the Americans," and "the Soviets are increasingly strengthening their pressure on Hanoi." The comments of these two American newspapers have exposed the bottom line of the Soviet revisionists' treacherous activities in the Vietnamese issue after the U.S. resumed bombing.

Since the beginning of this year, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has, in an unprecedented open manner, intensified its collusion with the U.S. on the Vietnamese issue, which is part of the overall plot of the U.S.-Soviet global deal this year.

According to Western newspapers, since the beginning of this year, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been secretly negotiating in Moscow and Washington to reach a new comprehensive deal. In these secret talks, "both sides acknowledge that the price for any agreement must be the resolution of the Vietnamese conflict." Therefore, the Johnson administration has, since this year, "emphasized its ability to reconcile with Moscow on issues ranging from the consular treaty to the current discussions on the anti-ballistic missile system," "to encourage the Soviet Union to play a more active role in promoting the start of Vietnamese talks" ("Washington Star," March 11). The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, to achieve more "reconciliation" with Washington, further tighten the "sacred alliance" with the U.S., and strengthen the anti-China alliance, has "never been more eager (for the fighting) to stop in Vietnam" than it is now. United Press International reporter Teller reported after the Soviet-British talks that the "most important conclusion" from the London talks was: anti-China is "one of the most urgent motives for Russia to end the Vietnam War and reconcile with the United States." It is precisely under these circumstances that, out of the common need to oppose China, communism, and the people, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has, since this year, colluded more closely with the U.S. in sabotaging the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war, acting more openly. Moreover, it is precisely because of the encouragement and support of the Soviet revisionists that the Americans, who have been beaten bloody by the Vietnamese people, have become arrogant, raised the price on the bombing halt issue, and, failing to deceive and surrender, have further frantically expanded the war in Vietnam, using "war to force surrender."

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Now is the historical era when world capitalism and imperialism are heading towards extinction, and world socialism and people's democracy are heading towards victory."

The tide of history is irresistible. Whether it is the U.S. imperialists' war blackmail and "peace" plots, or the Soviet revisionists' treacherous acts, they cannot destroy the just cause of the heroic Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation. The Vietnamese people will surely win, and the U.S. will surely fail. "The seas and oceans are roaring with clouds and waves, and the five continents are shaking with wind and thunder." The Soviet revisionist leaders who are on the same criminal ship with the American bandits will surely meet a bad end!

    积极充当美帝头号帮凶　妄图扑灭越南革命烈火
    苏修出卖越南人民利益同美帝大作交易
    美帝苏修的各种阴谋决不能阻挡越南人民取得最后胜利
    新华社十三日讯　本社记者报道：苏联修正主义领导集团今年以来进一步同美帝国主义密切勾结，空前露骨地向越南人民施加各种压力，企图迫使越南人民向美国侵略者屈服。种种事实表明，美帝在这期间所搞的“停炸诱降”的“和谈”骗局破产后，疯狂地搞战争“升级”，并在关岛黑会上部署扩大侵越战争的新的冒险计划，“以战迫降”，都是同苏修加紧叛卖活动分不开的。
    为了把越南问题纳入“苏美合作主宰世界”的轨道，苏修领导集团几年来一贯与美帝狼狈为奸，积极配合美帝战“和”反革命两手策略，千方百计地妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国战争的革命烈火。最近几个月，苏修领导集团充当美帝头号帮凶的叛徒面目，更加赤裸裸地暴露在光天化日之下。
    从今年年初起，约翰逊政府在加紧对越南的侵略战争的同时，围绕所谓“春节停火”，策划了又一个“停炸诱和”的阴谋。在华盛顿一手导演下，英国工党政府、联合国秘书长、梵蒂冈教皇和印度反动派接连抛出了一个个所谓“和谈”方案，为推销美国新的“和谈”骗局忙得不可开交。在这中间，为美帝忙得最起劲的要算苏修领导集团。苏修领导集团开动了它的全部宣传机器，与华盛顿遥相呼应，掀起一股持续好几个月的鼓吹“停炸和谈”的黑风。苏联报刊、广播电台和通讯社拚命为各种各样的美式“和谈”方案帮腔，掩盖美帝侵越罪行。它们按照美国的强盗逻辑，叫嚷越南战争“是国际紧张局势的主要因素”，“是威胁普遍和平的主要策源地”；鼓吹什么“让炮声在越南停止下来”，说什么停炸“是和平解决越南问题的第一步”。二月二日，塔斯社公然宣扬美国强盗头子约翰逊在美国电视广播记者招待会上发表的要越南北方人民停止支援越南南方同胞的英勇斗争的讲话，说什么，“约翰逊断言，如果河内表现出某种迎合行动的意愿，美国将停止轰炸越南北方。”
    苏修宣传机器配合美国“和谈”阴谋所掀起的这种甚嚣尘上的叫嚷，其持续时间之长，劲头之大，是前所未有的。
    与此同时，为了配合美国的“和谈”阴谋，苏修头目波德戈尔内和柯西金先后亲自出马，跑到国外为华盛顿充当“和谈”掮客。一月下旬，波德戈尔内到意大利访问，到处贩卖美国式的“和谈”黑货。在访意的一周期间，他没有说过一句谴责美国侵略越南的话，却大谈什么越南战争“对和平的严重威胁”。他只字不提越南人民关于美国侵略军必须撤出越南南方的正义要求，却配合美国“停炸诱和”的阴谋，强调只要“停炸”就可以为“和平解决（越南）冲突”“开辟道路”。一月三十日，他还破例地前往梵蒂冈，拜访教皇保罗六世，同华盛顿这个忠实走卒就“停炸和谈”问题互通讯息，秘密协商。
    随后不久，苏联部长会议主席柯西金又乘越南战场上春节“停火”的时机，赶到伦敦同英国首相威尔逊会谈越南问题，把帝修反这次“停炸诱降”阴谋推向高潮。
    苏英会谈期间，约翰逊、腊斯克、戈德堡之流狂妄地叫嚣，要越南人民屈服于美帝的大棒，立即报以“相应的和适当的逐步降级活动”，美国“才准备下令”停炸越南北方，甚至要南越人民“放下武器”。柯西金和威尔逊则在幕后呼应华盛顿的这种大棒和胡萝卜政策。
    西方报刊和通讯社最近纷纷报道，在约翰逊从华盛顿遥控指挥下举行的这次会谈中，美、英、苏三方曾就要越南人民采取所谓“对等行动”，来换取美国停止轰炸越南北方的问题进行了紧张的活动。会谈期间，约翰逊曾“进行了大规模的努力”，通过威尔逊把美国要越南人民在“停炸和谈”以前采取“对等姿态”的建议向柯西金作了“解释”。约翰逊政府在它玩弄的春节“停炸”于二月十二日期满之后，一度推迟恢复轰炸越南北方，就是为了便利柯西金“对河内施加压力，以作出对等姿态”。据各方面消息透露，柯西金在这一点上也着实地为华盛顿卖了一番力气。据美国报刊透露，柯西金在会谈期间，不仅为美国的“和谈”骗局出谋献策，而且还通过威尔逊向约翰逊政府泄露有关越南的某些情报。受到苏修支持的美国“停炸诱降”的阴谋很快就破产了，柯西金在离开伦敦的第二天，约翰逊政府随即悍然宣布恢复对越南北方的轰炸，紧接着又采取了一系列战争“升级”行动。英国《泰晤士报》三月一日援引华盛顿官员的话报道说，美国这些加剧侵越战争、以战压降的行动，“同柯西金（在伦敦会谈期间）对和谈感兴趣一事有关”。从以上这些事实中，人们不难看出，柯西金在访英期间究竟帮美国干了些什么可耻勾当。
    在帝修反这场新“慕尼黑”阴谋破产以后，苏修领导集团对美国“以战迫降”的一手，配合更加密切，继续同美国及其走卒在幕后酝酿新的“和谈”花招。
    二月二十七日，《纽约先驱论坛报》刊载约·艾尔索普发自华盛顿的一篇文章，“十分肯定地说”：“柯西金在伦敦所作的事情不过是个开端而已”，“可以十拿九稳地认为，苏联和美国的代表们正在某个密室或其他地方，共同探索导致越南和平的新倡议”。接近白宫的艾尔索普的这个断言，不是没有根据的。据来自各方面的消息报道，从二月下旬到现在，柯西金和腊斯克曾先后分别接见美国驻苏大使汤普森和苏联驻美大使多勃雷宁，密商越南问题。最近，苏联代表还在美国同联合国秘书长吴丹进行了频繁的接触和会谈。吴丹在三月二十八日公布的所谓“三点建议”，就是美苏合谋，继续对越南人民推行“压降”、“迫降”政策的新产物。
    《华盛顿明星晚报》和《纽约时报》不久以前在评论中指出，“在过去几周里清楚地看出，俄国人正在积极地谋求按美国可以接受的办法解决越南战争”，“苏联人越来越加强了对河内的压力”。美国这两家报纸的评论，一语揭出了苏修在美国恢复轰炸以后这段时期在越南问题上进行的叛卖活动的底。
    今年以来苏修领导集团在越南问题上空前露骨地加紧同美国勾结，是苏美今年进一步大搞全球交易的整个图谋的一部分。
    据西方报刊报道，从今年年初起，苏美双方一直在莫斯科和华盛顿就达成新的全面交易进行密商。在这些私房密谈中，“双方都承认，取得任何协议的代价必须是解决越南冲突”。因此，约翰逊政府今年以来“全力强调它同莫斯科在从领事条约”到目前正在进行的“关于反弹道导弹系统的讨论等问题上可以调和的方面”，“以鼓励苏联在争取开始越南会谈方面起更积极的作用”（《华盛顿明星晚报》三月十一日）。而苏修领导集团为了同华盛顿取得更多的“和解”，进一步拉紧同美国的“神圣同盟”的纽带，加强联美反华，也“比过去任何时候都更加渴望（越南）那里的战斗停止”。合众国际社记者特勒在苏英会谈收场后在报道中曾指出，从伦敦会谈中得出的“最重要的结论”是：反华“是俄国显然希望结束越南战争和同美国和解的最迫切的动机之一”。正是在这种情况下，出于共同反华、反共、反人民的需要，苏修领导集团今年以来在破坏越南人民抗美救国战争方面就同美国勾结得更紧，干得更露骨了。而且，正是由于得到苏修的鼓励和支持，被越南人民打得头破血流的美国佬才气焰嚣张，在停炸问题上提高了要价，诱降不成就进一步疯狂地扩大侵越战争，“以战迫降”。
    毛主席指出：“现在是全世界资本主义和帝国主义走向灭亡，全世界社会主义和人民民主主义走向胜利的历史时代”。
    历史的潮流是谁也扭转不了的。不论是美帝国主义的战争讹诈和“和平”阴谋，还是苏修的叛卖行径，都破坏不了英雄越南人民抗美救国的正义事业。越南人民必胜，美帝必败。“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”同美国强盗站在一条贼船上的苏修领导人是绝不会有好下场的！
