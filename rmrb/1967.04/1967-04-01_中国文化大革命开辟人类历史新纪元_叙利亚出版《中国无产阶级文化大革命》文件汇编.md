		Syria Publishes Compilation of Documents on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China

		BEIRUT, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Damascus Publishing House recently published a book titled "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China." This book is a compilation of many important documents published in China since the start of the Cultural Revolution.

		The translators' preface to the book states: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the most profound class struggle in the world. It has opened a new era in the history of socialism and human history. The great significance of this revolution has already transcended the boundaries of China.

		The preface says: Mao Zedong Thought is the banner and the powerful theoretical foundation of this cultural revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the living Marxism-Leninism of the present stage, and it is the pinnacle of proletarian revolutionary thought in the contemporary era. The preface says: A correct line has always been present throughout the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, guiding this revolution forward. This is the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao Zedong. The great teacher and thinker, Chairman Mao, had already outlined the contours of this cultural revolution more than twenty years ago.

		The preface also praises: Chinese revolutionary culture is diametrically opposed to Western bourgeois culture in terms of its ideological and artistic qualities. It is an unparalleled new culture in the world. It is the greatest torch and the brightest star of the socialist new culture that is about to spread throughout the world as the socialist system advances towards complete victory.
